###0 JEFF MICHAUD: Did you get my text?
###1 JEFF BENJAMIN: Which one?
###2 JEFF MICHAUD: We put the picture of the morels.
###4 JEFF BENJAMIN: The what?
###5 JEFF MICHAUD: Do you get it?
###5 Look at it.
###6 You've got to look at it.
###6 It says the first of the season morels.
###9 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Oh my God.
###12 Did he see it?
###13 MALE SPEAKER: No.
###13 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: dude.
###14 MARC VETRI: First of the season morels.
###16 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: the season morels.
###18 
###24 That is the funniest thing I've ever seen.
###26 
###37 JEFF MICHAUD: Get me set up for pip pot pie.
###40 Give me the container, give me the pot
###42 pie, give me the dough.
###43 My name is Jeff Michaud, and I cook at Alla Spina restaurant.
###48 Alla Spina is our Italian gastropub.
###51 We're known for our craft beers, whether they're Italian
###54 or from Europe or local.
###57 And then we're also known for our fun twists
###59 on Italian bar food.
###61 Ready for the pot pie magic?
###64 This is pot pie 2012.
###71 That half a bowl?
###73 Way too much verona.
###74 Ask him what he thinks.
###76 MARC VETRI: The [INAUDIBLE] is nice with the verona.
###78 JEFF MICHAUD: My partners Marc and Jeff go [INAUDIBLE]
###80 Italy every year, we take a couple trips.
###82 So we started visiting these Italian bars and we saw some
###85 that had crazy graffiti all over the walls.
###87 And the Italian beer movement was
###89 really starting to develop.
###90 So we came back and like there's nothing really in the
###92 States that's like this.
###94 So we had to do our version of Italian gastropub.
###96 We'll be a trendsetter for the States.
###98 
###102 MALE SPEAKER: You want one of these.
###103 I'm going to tell you, you want one of these.
###105 JEFF MICHAUD: As far as our clientele goes, they
###107 love what we do.
###109 They look for that as kind of off the wall weird stuff that
###112 we got going on.
###114 We kind of wanted to do a little twist on a hot dog.
###117 So we made a Mortadella hot dog.
###119 Same filling that you would make Mortadella with, except
###121 we stuff it in sheep milk casings.
###124 I don't care who you are, Pepperidge Farm hot dog roll,
###127 it's the only way to go.
###129 
###131 The most important thing about a hot dog is to have that snap
###134 when you bite into it.
###136 Some of the highlights on the Alla Spina menu are the veal
###138 breast millinae de Hogie, and we do our Italian version of
###141 poutine with guinea hen bone [INAUDIBLE] on top and
###144 mozzarella curd.
###145 And we do a whole pig's head.
###148 We use a lot of pig here, everything but the oink.
###150 Did you get my text today?
###152 MARC VETRI: Yeah.
###152 JEFF MICHAUD: Did you open up the picture?
###154 MARC VETRI: Yeah.
###156 JEFF MICHAUD: Ready?
###156 You're killing me, dude.
###158 Last night to go out, I picked Steve Wildy and Jeff Benjamin.
###161 Steve Wildy is the beverage director of the whole company
###164 and Jeff Benjamin is one of the owners.
###167 We always get together.
###168 We go out and have a drink every now and then.
###170 And we have some cool late night spots
###171 that we like to hit.
###172 JEFF BENJAMIN: Is that like "Cash Cab"?
###173 MALE SPEAKER: What is the best barbecue in Philadelphia?
###176 JEFF MICHAUD: Percy Street.
###177 
###182 I think it's one of those hidden gems.
###183 Like when you come in to Philly and then don't expect
###187 to find really awesome barbecue joints
###189 and they do it well.
###190 They don't do the Southern style where they rub it with
###192 the barbecue sauce.
###193 They do it with the gyro, the Texas style.
###196 
###202 MALE SPEAKER: What'd you do?
###203 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Fox 29 News, brand new mandolin,
###205 sliced the tip of my fucking finger off three
###208 seconds into the show.
###209 Dude, it looks like half a clove of garlic on the other
###212 side of the mandolin.
###213 MALE SPEAKER: Maybe they'll start using mandolins for
###214 brises now.
###215 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Oh my God.
###216 You'd feel no pain, they'd be so fucking sharp.
###219 JEFF MICHAUD: Me and Michael have known
###220 each other for years.
###221 He actually, before I moved to Italy, he took my spot at
###224 Vetri and we worked together for about two
###226 years before I left.
###228 He was my bitch.
###230 Thousands of dollars spent on labelling.
###233 Your chicken, how long's it cook for?
###234 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Chicken smokes, I believe, for under
###236 an hour-- probably about 45 minutes.
###238 JEFF BENJAMIN: Just smoke, and that's it?
###239 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Smoke, and that gives it a glaze, and
###240 then right on the charcoal grill.
###242 They don't ever do this in Texas, but we finish all of
###245 our meat on the charcoal.
###247 So it gets the woodsmoke, and then a finish on the charcoal.
###250 [BURPS]
###252 JEFF BENJAMIN: Nice.
###252 JEFF MICHAUD: He said I had to burp it to get the
###255 flavor of the beer.
###257 Did you smell it?
###258 STEVE WILDY: [INAUDIBLE].
###260 JEFF MICHAUD: Steve Wildy is a vegetarian, so that spot he
###264 thought was going to be a little bit of an issue.
###265 But they have a lot of side dishes that work for him, so
###270 he had a lot of options.
###271 STEVE WILDY: I always think that a chef's very immature
###273 and maybe inexperienced if they take that route--
###276 I just don't serve vegetarians, I don't do it.
###279 Because they're missing out on [INAUDIBLE].
###281 JEFF MICHAUD: Bourbon, all right.
###282 Now we're home.
###283 JEFF BENJAMIN: Now we're home.
###284 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I'm driving.
###286 
###288 JEFF MICHAUD: This is awesome.
###290 ERIN O'SHEA: Good.
###290 JEFF MICHAUD: The best turkey ass we've ever had.
###293 ERIN O'SHEA: Nice.
###293 JEFF MICHAUD: Turkey ass is like the little butts on the
###295 end of the turkey.
###296 She chops them off and smokes them for hours and they get
###300 really tender and they're moist.
###302 I've never had that before, it was awesome.
###304 He said hey, Jeff, check out the first
###306 of the season morels.
###307 ERIN O'SHEA: Oh, shit.
###309 JEFF MICHAUD: You look at it first, you're like looking at
###311 it and you're like, damn.
###312 
###315 When we finish up at Percy Street Barbecue, we grab Mike
###319 Solomonov and Erin O'Shea, we hop in the van and we headed
###322 to Pub & Kitchen.
###323 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Let me help you out, dude.
###324 JEFF MICHAUD: Oh, sorry.
###325 I'm like oh, whoa!
###326 Oh, sorry about that.
###328 
###331 Pub & Kitchen is a local bar.
###333 There's a lot of industry people that go there.
###335 Johnny Mac is the chef and he's worked with some really
###338 great people.
###339 James Beard is great, food and wine is great, having chefs
###343 eat your food at midnight is even better-- then you know it
###345 really matters.
###347 
###349 He has one side of it which is burgers and regular bar food
###352 that you would get anywhere.
###353 And then the other side of it has a little more refined
###357 stuff like rabbit [INAUDIBLE] and the whipped goat butter
###360 that we have with the nice blanched vegetables.
###362 
###367 JOHNNY MAC: Some nice, fatty Rhode Island skate wing here.
###370 
###373 I always like to cook skate the way I cook pancakes.
###376 You let it cook until it just kind of starts to
###380 bubble on this side.
###382 And then you just baste it, flip it, kiss it, take it out.
###387 This is solid late night food, man.
###389 Pickled meat, some nice grains, a little bit of
###392 vegetables, a good piece of fish cooked in butter.
###396 Really simple, really easy, not rewriting anything here.
###400 Fine dining in blue jeans.
###401 We turn the music way up at night, we turn
###403 the lights way down.
###405 Just trying to make good food for friends.
###407 JEFF MICHAUD: Did you get my morel picture?
###409 JOHNNY MAC: Yeah, looks delicious.
###412 JEFF MICHAUD: Can you feed me an oyster, Michael?
###415 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Are you ready?
###416 Slowly.
###417 Whoa!
###419 MALE SPEAKER: It puts the oyster in the mouth.
###422 MALE SPEAKER: Put the fucking oyster in the mouth.
###423 JEFF MICHAUD: Mike's a lot fun to go out with.
###426 He just likes to enjoy life and you get a lot of
###428 laughs out of it.
###430 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Blows me away when people go to
###432 restaurants and then shit.
###433 I'm like, really?
###433 You're going to shit in my restaurant?
###436 JEFF MICHAUD: Wow.
###438 Beautiful.
###440 We brought over a plate of asparagus with prosciutto
###443 gelee and this fried egg on top.
###445 And when I hit that egg, it shot all over Michael's nice
###449 velvet jacket.
###450 Ready?
###451 JOHNNY MAC: Yeah, get the money shot on that.
###453 EVERYONE: Oh!
###453 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Oh my God, how did you do that, dude?
###458 That was perfect.
###459 It's on the bandage, too.
###461 That's fucking so pornographic, bro.
###464 JEFF MICHAUD: We were getting ready to leave and then
###466 everybody was asking where's Steve?
###468 Where's Steve?
###468 And they said he's in the bathroom.
###470 And so we grabbed the camera and went downstairs and
###474 basically I kicked the bathroom door in on him.
###476 Open all ready!
###477 Yeah!
###480 JOHNNY MAC: You're on munchies, man!
###482 STEVE WILDY: You're going to need a body bag, Johnny!
###484 JOHNNY MAC: Well, locker room humor, it never gets old.
###488 JEFF MICHAUD: You ready?
###489 When we left Pub & Kitchen, we added Johnny Mac with us and
###493 we all headed back to Alla Spina for
###495 some late-night munchies.
###496 STEVE WILDY: Is anybody else freaked out by the ease with
###500 which Johnny flipped open the men's room stall door?
###504 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: He was like, it's just
###506 like the rest stop.
###506 JEFF MICHAUD: We planned to cook some of the food at Alla
###509 Spina that really makes us who we are.
###511 JOHNNY MAC: I'll pull an espresso in a minute, dude.
###514 JEFF MICHAUD: It's something I like to eat late at night.
###518 After a couple of beers, you always want some fried stuff.
###520 So we did some fried pig tails with a fennel agrodolce which
###525 is a sweet and sour sauce.
###526 It's almost like a version of a chicken wing, except it's
###528 done with pig tails.
###530 We did some awesome fried snails in a beer batter with a
###534 garlic and parsley tartar sauce.
###535 These are extra large burgundy snails.
###538 And the show stopper's always that big pig's head.
###543 We brine for about four days, it comes off
###544 about a 30 pound pig.
###546 After it comes out of the brine, we score the face, we
###548 pour the agrodulce over it, we roast it in the oven for 20
###551 minutes, 30 minutes.
###552 It's gets all nice and charred and caramelized.
###555 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: You can make this one squeal.
###557 [SQUEALS]
###559 JEFF MICHAUD: All right, guys.
###561 ERIN O'SHEA: What are you looking at?
###562 Oh, shit.
###563 JEFF MICHAUD: The cheeks are falling off, the neck's
###565 falling off.
###566 There's people that eat the eyes, that crack the skull
###568 open and they go for the brains.
###570 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Thanks, Jeff.
###571 It looks fucking awesome.
###571 ERIN O'SHEA: Here's to that.
###572 Thank you.
###573 
###576 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: It's normal for you to stick
###577 your dick in my mouth.
###578 Totally.
###579 JEFF MICHAUD: Did you get some snails, Johnny?
###581 JOHNNY MAC: Yeah, but I would like some more.
###582 
###587 JEFF MICHAUD: Cheers, guys.
###588 Thanks for coming out tonight.
###591 MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Cheers!
###593 Woo!
###595 JEFF MICHAUD: When you get to that point, it's like you're
###598 just eating because it's there.
###600
