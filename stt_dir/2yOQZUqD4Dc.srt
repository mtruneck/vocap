2
0:0:2,5 --> 0:0:3,6
Earth


3
0:0:3,6 --> 0:0:6,21
a 4,5 billion year old planet


4
0:0:6,21 --> 0:0:8,82
still evolving


5
0:0:8,82 --> 0:0:13,98
As continents shift and clash, volcanoes erupt


6
0:0:13,98 --> 0:0:16,6
and glaciers grow and recede


7
0:0:16,6 --> 0:0:22,32
the earth's crust is carved in numerous and fascinating ways


8
0:0:22,32 --> 0:0:26,91
leaving a trail of geological mysteries behind


9
0:0:26,91 --> 0:0:27,9
In this episode, Iceland


10
0:0:27,9 --> 0:0:33,21
the wolrd's largest volcanic island is explored


11
0:0:33,21 --> 0:0:40,98
This barren and alien landscape generates 1/3 of the world's lava


12
0:0:40,98 --> 0:0:43,28
Steam billows from the ground


13
0:0:43,28 --> 0:0:47,88
and boiling water is thrusted into the air


14
0:0:47,88 --> 0:0:50,4
It's a land of violent extremes


15
0:0:50,4 --> 0:0:55,9
where fire meets it's nemesis, ice


16
0:0:55,9 --> 0:0:59,6
where clues to understanding Iceland's formation


17
0:0:59,6 --> 0:1:14,78
also provide a window into the formation of the earth itself


18
0:1:14,78 --> 0:1:17,78
In the middle of the North Atlantic ocean lies Iceland


19
0:1:17,78 --> 0:1:22,58
a lone island only 300 miles (480 Km) wide


20
0:1:22,58 --> 0:1:23,98
a volcanic hot pit


21
0:1:23,98 --> 0:1:29,33
it holds some of the most diverse geological wonders known to mankind


22
0:1:29,33 --> 0:1:31,18
To understand how it formed


23
0:1:31,18 --> 0:1:33,65
and the dynamic forces that are shaping this land


24
0:1:33,65 --> 0:1:38,38
scientists are scouring the strange landscape for clues


25
0:1:38,38 --> 0:1:40,48
And the investigation starts here


26
0:1:40,48 --> 0:1:46,28
in the southwest of Iceland: Thingvellir plane


27
0:1:46,28 --> 0:1:50,6
This broad inland valley runs through the centre of Iceland


28
0:1:50,6 --> 0:1:53,78
giant cracks scar the valley floor


29
0:1:53,78 --> 0:2:2,23
leaving this unusual landscape behind


30
0:2:2,23 --> 0:2:10,74
Geologist Mike Poland believes there are major clues in the mystery of Iceland's formation


31
0:2:10,74 --> 0:2:15,8
I'm standing at a really spectacular place. There's evidence for volcanic activity all around,


32
0:2:15,8 --> 0:2:19,18
this valley is covered in lava, and the plane has been ripped apart


33
0:2:19,18 --> 0:2:26,28
Everywhere I look there's massive tears in the ground like this one right here


34
0:2:26,28 --> 0:2:28,38
This crack is getting bigger and bigger every year


35
0:2:28,38 --> 0:2:32,48
In fact, this entire valley is spreading apart


36
0:2:32,48 --> 0:2:34,58
at about the same rate the fingernails grow


37
0:2:34,58 --> 0:2:41,43
Imagine the forces that must be involved to rip the land apart like this


38
0:2:41,43 --> 0:2:48,74
Something powerful is spreading this valley at a rate of 1 inch (2,5 cm) per year


39
0:2:48,74 --> 0:2:57,48
A force so inmense it's pulling the entire country apart


40
0:2:57,48 --> 0:3:2,51
But what force on earth could have such power?


41
0:3:2,51 --> 0:3:6,35
In 1912 german climatologist Alfred Wegener,


42
0:3:6,35 --> 0:3:10,45
found an essential clue. 
Browsing through maps,


43
0:3:10,45 --> 0:3:18,0
he noticed that the great land masses of the Americas and Eurasia appeared to fit together


44
0:3:18,0 --> 0:3:22,65
This observation led Wegener to propose a radical new theory:


45
0:3:22,65 --> 0:3:27,75
That these great continents had once been joined together.


46
0:3:27,75 --> 0:3:30,85
So some unseen force must have pushed them apart


47
0:3:30,85 --> 0:3:34,28
allowing water to rush into the space between them


48
0:3:34,28 --> 0:3:38,8
creating the Atlantic ocean


49
0:3:38,8 --> 0:3:41,51
It was inspired detective work, and a major step forward 


50
0:3:41,51 --> 0:3:46,1
in the search for what was pulling Iceand apart


51
0:3:46,1 --> 0:3:49,11
But with no method to prove such a force existed


52
0:3:49,11 --> 0:3:55,4
Wegener's theory was ignored for the next 40 years.


53
0:3:55,4 --> 0:4:3,81
Then in 1946, new evidence was discovered to support Wegener's ideas


54
0:4:3,81 --> 0:4:8,15
The U.S. navy, using a technology called SONAR IMAGING


55
0:4:8,15 --> 0:4:12,25
mapped the Atlantic ocean floor for the first time


56
0:4:12,25 --> 0:4:17,35
The pictures revealed a 10.000 mile (16.000 Km) network of underwater mountains


57
0:4:17,35 --> 0:4:23,93
separated by a giant tear which passes through the center of the Atlantic


58
0:4:23,93 --> 0:4:28,47
Scientists called this the Mid-Atlantic Ridge


59
0:4:28,47 --> 0:4:34,65
This huge tear through the earth's crust is the boundary between the American and Eurasian plates


60
0:4:34,65 --> 0:4:40,99
and the tear runs right through the center of Iceland


61
0:4:40,99 --> 0:4:43,85
I'm actually standing on what's the center of the ocean floor


62
0:4:43,85 --> 0:4:45,95
Where the Mid-Atlantic Ridge comes on the land


63
0:4:45,95 --> 0:4:49,5
and this puts the North American plate on this side


64
0:4:49,5 --> 0:4:51,15
from the Eurasian plate on this side


65
0:4:51,15 --> 0:4:53,53
and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge starts way south, down by Antarctica


66
0:4:53,53 --> 0:4:55,63
comes all the way up through the Atlantic


67
0:4:55,63 --> 0:4:59,4
and splits this country right in two


68
0:4:59,4 --> 0:5:5,51
Scientists suspected this was pushing the continents and Iceland apart


69
0:5:5,51 --> 0:5:10,28
They came up with a theory: Deep below the ocean,


70
0:5:10,28 --> 0:5:13,38
convection currents of molten rock tear open the earth's crust


71
0:5:13,38 --> 0:5:19,48
allowing magma to seep up and push the continents apart


72
0:5:19,48 --> 0:5:25,58
But there was a problem: It was so deep, scientists had no way of proving


73
0:5:25,58 --> 0:5:30,68
where the magma was seeping through the crust at the centre of the ridge


74
0:5:30,68 --> 0:5:36,77
Until in 1974. Alvin, a human-operated submersible


75
0:5:36,77 --> 0:5:41,5
was launched by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute


76
0:5:41,5 --> 0:5:46,69
with its ability to withstand deep-sea pressures, scientists could finally travel down


77
0:5:46,69 --> 0:5:51,79
to the depths needed to reach the Mid-Atlantic Ridge


78
0:5:51,79 --> 0:5:56,89
It was by examining the tear that runs through the center of this ridge


79
0:5:56,89 --> 0:5:59,46
that they spotted the evidence they had been looking for


80
0:5:59,46 --> 0:6:6,34
Hot volcanic gases billowing into the ocean


81
0:6:6,34 --> 0:6:10,44
Finding this told them that the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was highly volcanic


82
0:6:10,44 --> 0:6:17,91
and, like a giant wedge, was capable of spreading great land masses apart


83
0:6:17,91 --> 0:6:24,9
Iceland's cracked Thingvellir Valley is a continuation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge


84
0:6:24,9 --> 0:6:28,31
The same process that is pushing America further away from Europe


85
0:6:28,31 --> 0:6:33,7
is happening here, on land


86
0:6:33,7 --> 0:6:38,88
Finally, here was a force powerful enough to explain why the cracks are getting wider


87
0:6:38,88 --> 0:6:41,92
and Iceland is getting bigger


88
0:6:41,92 --> 0:6:46,77
As the ridge continues to spread, it's going to add more and more land to Iceland


89
0:6:46,77 --> 0:6:50,31
so in a way Iceland will start getting longer and longer


90
0:6:50,31 --> 0:6:55,82
in an east-west sense, as the plates spread apart from one another


91
0:6:55,82 --> 0:7:0,33
So, in a way, Iceland is not getting torn apart so much as it's getting built


92
0:7:0,33 --> 0:7:4,56
The investigation into how Iceland is growing has revealed:


93
0:7:4,56 --> 0:7:10,65
Cracks on the Thingvellir plane are widening at a rate of 1 inch (2,5 cm) per year


94
0:7:10,65 --> 0:7:15,64
And hot gases prove that this spreading force is volcanic


95
0:7:15,64 --> 0:7:22,46
forming the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which cuts right through Iceland


96
0:7:22,46 --> 0:7:28,69
Scientists concluded it's THIS that's widening the country


97
0:7:28,69 --> 0:7:34,37
Convection currents of hot rock pull the Mid-Atlantic Ridge apart,


98
0:7:34,37 --> 0:7:37,47
magma surges up to fill the cracks,


99
0:7:37,47 --> 0:7:42,2
and as it approaches the surface it cools, hardens, and forms new land


100
0:7:42,2 --> 0:7:48,2
Like a conveyor belt, it continually pushes Iceland apart


101
0:7:48,2 --> 0:7:53,21
But something didn't add up: Why wasn't Iceland at the bottom of the ocean,


102
0:7:53,21 --> 0:7:56,78
like the rest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge?


103
0:7:56,78 --> 0:8:1,94
There's something strange about the amount of volcanic activity on this island


104
0:8:1,94 --> 0:8:4,96
Because this is not a normal section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge


105
0:8:4,96 --> 0:8:8,16
There's a tremendous amount of volcanism that's happening in this part of the ridge


106
0:8:8,16 --> 0:8:14,49
as opposed to the ridge that's off in the Atlantic Ocean


107
0:8:14,49 --> 0:8:20,77
The hunt is now on to discover how Iceland rose a mile and a half (2.400 m) off the ocean floor


108
0:8:20,77 --> 0:8:30,76
and became the biggest volcanic island in the world


109
0:8:30,76 --> 0:8:31,22
Iceland


110
0:8:31,22 --> 0:8:34,82
There are more active volcanoes concentrated here


111
0:8:34,82 --> 0:8:40,36
than anywhere else on the planet


112
0:8:40,36 --> 0:8:45,87
Geologists are searching for what has helped to push Iceland off the ocean floor


113
0:8:45,87 --> 0:8:55,5
and lights the firy volcanoes that rage across this barren land


114
0:8:55,5 --> 0:9:1,31
On the hunt for clues, the investigation heads to one of Iceland's most active volcanoes,


115
0:9:1,31 --> 0:9:2,7
Hekla


116
0:9:2,7 --> 0:9:6,97
Known locally as the "Gateway to Hell"


117
0:9:6,97 --> 0:9:13,85
Like all active volcanoes in Iceland, Hekla sits alongside the Mid-Atlantic Ridge


118
0:9:13,85 --> 0:9:19,6
Volcanologist Dr. Pete La Femina is taking a High-resolution scan of the volcano


119
0:9:19,6 --> 0:9:24,83
to see if its geology hides any clues about its inner workings


120
0:9:24,83 --> 0:9:26,83
This is a terrestrial laser scanner


121
0:9:26,83 --> 0:9:31,4
and the laser produces a 3D image of the earth's surface


122
0:9:31,4 --> 0:9:39,81
and that allows us to see parts of Hekla volcano here that we can't see with the naked eye


123
0:9:39,81 --> 0:9:45,21
His scan reveals a giant crack, or fissure, running right through the centre of the volcano


124
0:9:45,21 --> 0:9:50,7
similar to those found in the Thingvellir Valley


125
0:9:50,7 --> 0:9:53,9
But this fissure doesn't just expand the width of the volcano,


126
0:9:53,9 --> 0:9:58,71
it extends either side along a 5-mile (8 Km) tear in the earth


127
0:9:58,71 --> 0:10:7,71
It's this tear that is key to understanding how Iceland's volcanoes erupt


128
0:10:7,71 --> 0:10:13,85
When Hekla erupted in the year 2000 it wasn't just a volcanic cone that exploded


129
0:10:13,85 --> 0:10:19,89
The earth actually ripped open along the entire 5-mile (8 Km) lenght of the fissure,


130
0:10:19,89 --> 0:10:24,21
a weakness created by the stretching along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge


131
0:10:24,21 --> 0:10:29,71
In the geological world these are known as "Fissure Eruptions"


132
0:10:29,71 --> 0:10:34,75
Forced open by the sheer volume of magma pushing up from below,


133
0:10:34,75 --> 0:10:41,3
the tear spewed out a terrifying 750 million cubic feet (21 million m3) of molten rock an hour


134
0:10:41,3 --> 0:10:44,87
flodding the land with lava


135
0:10:44,87 --> 0:10:52,83
These fissure eruptions are so huge they can change the landscape drastically in a matter of days


136
0:10:52,83 --> 0:10:59,1
leaving behind mountains like these


137
0:10:59,1 --> 0:11:2,11
You can see to the North here, where the earth's surface actually opened up


138
0:11:2,11 --> 0:11:5,3
during a fissure eruption, and lava erupted out


139
0:11:5,3 --> 0:11:10,5
This fissure starts to the north and extends 8 Km through


140
0:11:10,5 --> 0:11:12,67
Hekla volcano here


141
0:11:12,67 --> 0:11:17,49
The sheer volume of magma produced can be seen very well here


142
0:11:17,49 --> 0:11:20,59
at Hekla volcano, specially with these lava flows


143
0:11:20,59 --> 0:11:22,69
that have graved the land's surface


144
0:11:22,69 --> 0:11:27,68
And to me this is really exciting, because you can see very large volmes of erupted material


145
0:11:27,68 --> 0:11:30,85
produced over very short amount of time


146
0:11:30,85 --> 0:11:34,95
and Hekla is a beautiful place to study that


147
0:11:34,95 --> 0:11:40,95
But what is creating the vast quantities of lava that are forced out during these eruptions?


148
0:11:40,95 --> 0:11:44,37
For many years the answer remained elusive


149
0:11:44,37 --> 0:11:51,52
until geologists found incriminating evidence locked inside the rocks


150
0:11:51,52 --> 0:11:53,91
The composition of the rocks here in Iceland is quite different


151
0:11:53,91 --> 0:11:55,7
to what we see in other places


152
0:11:55,7 --> 0:11:57,81
By taking this rock back to the Lab we can get a very good idea


153
0:11:57,81 --> 0:11:59,91
of under what conditions it formed


154
0:11:59,91 --> 0:12:6,3
whether it formed deep within the earth or near the surface


155
0:12:6,3 --> 0:12:12,73
This rock was once molten lava which erupted from one of Iceland's volcanoes


156
0:12:12,73 --> 0:12:17,71
Analysis of the chemicals in the rock revealed unusually high concentrations


157
0:12:17,71 --> 0:12:21,3
of rare earth elements, lanthium and cesium,


158
0:12:21,3 --> 0:12:27,8
chemicals which are only found in magma with a very deep origin


159
0:12:27,8 --> 0:12:30,34
It's the breakthrough scentists had been searching for


160
0:12:30,34 --> 0:12:34,35
It was evidence that another, much deeper heath source


161
0:12:34,35 --> 0:12:36,95
was combining with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge


162
0:12:36,95 --> 0:12:40,83
to power the volcanoes of Iceland


163
0:12:40,83 --> 0:12:45,0
The rock evidence suggested this second force laid hidden from view


164
0:12:45,0 --> 0:12:49,1
deep beneath Iceland's surface


165
0:12:49,1 --> 0:12:56,54
But, it is possible to get a glimpse of what's happening down there


166
0:12:56,54 --> 0:13:2,45
Scientists monitor the seismic waves triggered by earthquakes all over the world


167
0:13:2,45 --> 0:13:7,28
As the earth's plates move, they release shockwaves called seimic waves


168
0:13:7,28 --> 0:13:10,23
that pass through the earth's crust


169
0:13:10,23 --> 0:13:15,0
These travel at a steady speed unless they hit a region of hard rock


170
0:13:15,0 --> 0:13:18,6
Then, they slow down


171
0:13:18,6 --> 0:13:21,19
Now as seismic waves arrive in Iceland


172
0:13:21,19 --> 0:13:23,42
they're travelling very slowly through the subsurface


173
0:13:23,42 --> 0:13:27,74
and this is something unique to Iceland and a few other places in the world


174
0:13:27,74 --> 0:13:32,24
It tells us as there's a very hard column of rock


175
0:13:32,24 --> 0:13:36,4
perhaps even some molten material beneath the surface


176
0:13:36,4 --> 0:13:39,21
These massive columns or "plumes" are known as HOT SPOTS


177
0:13:39,21 --> 0:13:42,61
and are not unique to Iceland


178
0:13:42,61 --> 0:13:48,47
They're found beneath certain volcanic areas in the world, like Hawaii and Yellowstone


179
0:13:48,47 --> 0:13:52,88
Hot Spots are these unwavering plumes of hot material


180
0:13:52,88 --> 0:14:0,64
including molten rock -magma- that stream up to the surface from deep within the earth


181
0:14:0,64 --> 0:14:4,61
The scientists finally had a snapshot of the second force


182
0:14:4,61 --> 0:14:7,68
that was helping to create Iceland


183
0:14:7,68 --> 0:14:9,55
The Hot Spot that lies beneath the island


184
0:14:9,55 --> 0:14:12,2
is almost 100 miles (160 Km) wide


185
0:14:12,2 --> 0:14:15,73
and 400 miles (640 Km) deep


186
0:14:15,73 --> 0:14:22,3
It channels rock slowly upwards at temperatures over 700º Fahrenheit


187
0:14:22,3 --> 0:14:26,36
It pushes against the crust, heating the land from below


188
0:14:26,36 --> 0:14:30,98
and forcing magma up onto the surface, as lava


189
0:14:30,98 --> 0:14:37,18
The investigation has identified the two colossal forces that built Iceland


190
0:14:37,18 --> 0:14:39,58
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge


191
0:14:39,58 --> 0:14:43,87
and the deeper Icelandic Hot Spot


192
0:14:43,87 --> 0:14:45,55
Millions of years ago,


193
0:14:45,55 --> 0:14:48,61
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge drifted eastwards


194
0:14:48,61 --> 0:14:52,0
creeping towards the fixed Icelandic Hot Spot


195
0:14:52,0 --> 0:14:56,86
Finally they met, and have been locked together in a deadly partnership


196
0:14:56,86 --> 0:15:1,4
ever since


197
0:15:1,4 --> 0:15:5,68
The result: A truly formidable volcanic beast


198
0:15:5,68 --> 0:15:10,57
capable of creating magma on a monumental scale


199
0:15:10,57 --> 0:15:13,36
As the Mid Ocean Ridge pulls apart


200
0:15:13,36 --> 0:15:16,92
there's decompression of the material underneath it, and that creates melting


201
0:15:16,92 --> 0:15:21,5
Decompression is simply removing the pressure from a pile of rock


202
0:15:21,5 --> 0:15:23,2
it's much like opening a can of soda


203
0:15:23,2 --> 0:15:25,73
or popping the cork off of a champagne bottle


204
0:15:25,73 --> 0:15:27,85
The removal of so much pressure


205
0:15:27,85 --> 0:15:30,78
makes the rock melt into liquid magma


206
0:15:30,78 --> 0:15:34,75
And the Hot Spot is transporting heat directly from the interior of the earth to the surface


207
0:15:34,75 --> 0:15:36,85
which also creates melting


208
0:15:36,85 --> 0:15:40,46
So this combination of decompression of existing rock beneath the surface


209
0:15:40,46 --> 0:15:46,86
and the direct transport of heat from the center of the earth created huge amounts of magma


210
0:15:46,86 --> 0:15:50,75
This incredible meeting of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Hot Spot


211
0:15:50,75 --> 0:15:53,62
began to build the island beneath the waves


212
0:15:53,62 --> 0:15:59,14
pushing it upwards and giving birth to Iceland


213
0:15:59,14 --> 0:16:2,52
Scientists have dated the island's emergence to 20 million years ago


214
0:16:2,52 --> 0:16:5,96
but could only imagine what this might have looked like


215
0:16:5,96 --> 0:16:11,3
But on November 14th, 1963, off the south coast of Iceland


216
0:16:11,3 --> 0:16:20,16
The world watched an action-replay of Iceland's spectacular birth


217
0:16:20,16 --> 0:16:23,5
A column of rock and ash blasted out of the ocean


218
0:16:23,5 --> 0:16:26,57
18.000 feet (5.400 m) into the sky


219
0:16:26,57 --> 0:16:33,8
So high it could be seen 70 miles (110 Km) away in Iceland's capital city, Reykjavík


220
0:16:33,8 --> 0:16:40,32
A new island was forming, right in front of the world's eyes


221
0:16:40,32 --> 0:16:48,68
Scientists called it Surtsey after the Norse god of fire: Surtr


222
0:16:48,68 --> 0:16:50,73
Located 20 miles (32 Km) off the mainland,


223
0:16:50,73 --> 0:16:55,99
the small island of Surtsey is now a magnet for geologists


224
0:16:55,99 --> 0:16:59,43
It offers a wealth of forensic evidence for Dr. La Femina,


225
0:16:59,43 --> 0:17:6,37
who is investigating how Iceland first formed


226
0:17:6,37 --> 0:17:8,47
It'a amazing to see Surtsey for the first time


227
0:17:8,47 --> 0:17:10,6
I've seen pictures, I've seen aerial photographs


228
0:17:10,6 --> 0:17:13,64
but actually be here and get a chance to 


229
0:17:13,64 --> 0:17:16,17
to go out and see it up close and actually look at the geology


230
0:17:16,17 --> 0:17:25,45
it's just inspiring


231
0:17:25,45 --> 0:17:29,41
This type of eruption that formed Surtsey has now been named after Surtsey


232
0:17:29,41 --> 0:17:30,99
We call them "Surtseyan Eruptions",


233
0:17:30,99 --> 0:17:33,59
and they're very, very explosive


234
0:17:33,59 --> 0:17:37,47
The interaction of hot magma or lava with the ocean


235
0:17:37,47 --> 0:17:41,57
causes these very steam-rich and highly explosive eruptions


236
0:17:41,57 --> 0:17:44,6
of ash and water


237
0:17:44,6 --> 0:17:48,38
When scientists first stepped foot into the island in the summer of '64


238
0:17:48,38 --> 0:17:51,93
they found it hard to believe that this was an island whose age


239
0:17:51,93 --> 0:17:54,94
was measured in MONTHS, not millenia


240
0:17:54,94 --> 0:18:0,52
In about 9,5 months this whole volcanic cone built up


241
0:18:0,52 --> 0:18:4,43
In addition, lava flows came out of the volcanic center here


242
0:18:4,43 --> 0:18:9,2
and we seen those as nice black cliffs in front of us


243
0:18:9,2 --> 0:18:14,22
Now geologists had an insight into how early Iceland might have formed


244
0:18:14,22 --> 0:18:22,44
In only 20 million years, Iceland grew from a tiny island into a 40.000 square mile (104.000 Km2) landmass,


245
0:18:22,44 --> 0:18:27,41
as big as the state of Kentucky


246
0:18:27,41 --> 0:18:29,92
The forces that powered Iceland's volcanoes


247
0:18:29,92 --> 0:18:32,41
have been revealed


248
0:18:32,41 --> 0:18:38,65
Cracks along Hekla volcano unleashed gigantic fissure eruptions


249
0:18:38,65 --> 0:18:41,75
and rare chemicals in the rock proved


250
0:18:41,75 --> 0:18:45,9
that these eruptions were fuelled by two separated forces:


251
0:18:45,9 --> 0:18:50,28
Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Hot Spot


252
0:18:50,28 --> 0:18:55,48
Iceland grew to become the world's largest volcanic island


253
0:18:55,48 --> 0:19:1,18
But volcanism alone doesn't explain how the land of Iceland was formed


254
0:19:1,18 --> 0:19:4,98
The investigation will honour another equally dramatic force


255
0:19:4,98 --> 0:19:9,21
that sculpted the distinctive shape of the Iceland we know today


256
0:19:9,21 --> 0:19:21,6
A force which would challenge the might of Iceland's volcanoes


257
0:19:21,6 --> 0:19:23,7
If Iceland was formed by fire alone,


258
0:19:23,7 --> 0:19:28,23
it should look like other volcanic islands such as Hawaii or Tahiti


259
0:19:28,23 --> 0:19:33,1
But something else was at work here to transform this island


260
0:19:33,1 --> 0:19:37,46
into the distinctive shape it is today


261
0:19:37,46 --> 0:19:41,76
Its shape is another clue to Iceland's formation


262
0:19:41,76 --> 0:19:45,62
An extraordinary force indented Iceland's Northern coastline


263
0:19:45,62 --> 0:19:51,12
burrowing deep fjords which extended far inland


264
0:19:51,12 --> 0:19:57,4
But, what colossal force could cause such a dramatic change to Iceland's volcanic landscape?


265
0:19:57,4 --> 0:20:1,85
There's an obvious suspect that is found scattered across the island:


266
0:20:1,85 --> 0:20:3,95
Ice


267
0:20:3,95 --> 0:20:11,95
As its name suggests, Iceland has a long history of being covered in ice, like this


268
0:20:11,95 --> 0:20:14,64
Today it covers 10% of the island


269
0:20:14,64 --> 0:20:16,84
all year round


270
0:20:16,84 --> 0:20:22,19
And in the middle of the country lies Europe's biggest ice cap:


271
0:20:22,19 --> 0:20:26,8
The mighty Vatnajökull


272
0:20:26,8 --> 0:20:28,9
Over 3000 square miles (7.800 Km2) in size


273
0:20:28,9 --> 0:20:37,11
Vatnajökull is so large it even has its own climatic conditions


274
0:20:37,11 --> 0:20:38,75
Up to two thirds of a mile (1 Km) thick,


275
0:20:38,75 --> 0:20:42,28
it squashes the land like a giant slab of rock


276
0:20:42,28 --> 0:20:44,95
and at its edges great tongues of ice


277
0:20:44,95 --> 0:20:54,67
flow out through deep valleys


278
0:20:54,67 --> 0:20:56,69
Glacier expert Dr. Mattew Roberts


279
0:20:56,69 --> 0:21:0,39
is investigating how ice can gauge out solid rock


280
0:21:0,39 --> 0:21:9,78
and discover the role it is playing in Iceland's past


281
0:21:9,78 --> 0:21:13,45
This is a GPS receiver, just like in car satellite navigation


282
0:21:13,45 --> 0:21:16,11
it's used here to measure glacier movement


283
0:21:16,11 --> 0:21:17,87
this will be left on the ice surface for a few days


284
0:21:17,87 --> 0:21:20,3
and I'll come back and analyse the data


285
0:21:20,3 --> 0:21:24,72
to discover just how far the glacier has moved


286
0:21:24,72 --> 0:21:29,41
Dr. Roberts data reveals that this whole glacier is sliding forward


287
0:21:29,41 --> 0:21:34,15
at an astounding rate of 2 feet (0,6 m) ... per day!


288
0:21:34,15 --> 0:21:37,35
This is an amazing ever changing environement: The ice around me is like


289
0:21:37,35 --> 0:21:40,65
an icy sea that has been frozen in place


290
0:21:40,65 --> 0:21:44,4
As the ice flows out to the confines of the valley


291
0:21:44,4 --> 0:21:46,74
it expands, it spreads to occupy a greater area


292
0:21:46,74 --> 0:21:49,33
Now as it expands, crevasses form


293
0:21:49,33 --> 0:21:51,78
In large depressions, just like the one here,


294
0:21:51,78 --> 0:21:54,58
(here's a smaller crevasse that is formed)


295
0:21:54,58 --> 0:21:57,15
ocasionally when these crevasses open, as it begin to open,


296
0:21:57,15 --> 0:21:59,23
sounds can be heard


297
0:21:59,23 --> 0:22:3,3
Also, the glacier ocasionally makes a groaning sound


298
0:22:3,3 --> 0:22:6,16
it's all signs that the glacier is alive and moving forward


299
0:22:6,16 --> 0:22:10,2
very slowly


300
0:22:10,2 --> 0:22:15,91
Vatnajökull is one of the largest ice caps in the northern hemisphere


301
0:22:15,91 --> 0:22:18,73
flowing down the valleys, the great mass of ice


302
0:22:18,73 --> 0:22:24,23
bears down with the weight of 100 tons per square foot (975 tons/m2) 


303
0:22:24,23 --> 0:22:27,28
Dr. Roberts believes this moving giant is a force


304
0:22:27,28 --> 0:22:29,38
capable of eroding solid rock,


305
0:22:29,38 --> 0:22:32,73
and he has found crucial evidence to prove it


306
0:22:32,73 --> 0:22:35,96
This is an excellent example of the power of glacial erosion


307
0:22:35,96 --> 0:22:38,69
This boulder would have been trapped beneath the base of the ice


308
0:22:38,69 --> 0:22:40,79
and, as the ice flowed over the surface of it,


309
0:22:40,79 --> 0:22:43,81
it would have progressively eroded the surface of the boulder


310
0:22:43,81 --> 0:22:48,7
to produce these very distinctive marks, called striations, in its surface


311
0:22:48,7 --> 0:22:51,3
We can even tell the direction in wich the ice was flowing


312
0:22:51,3 --> 0:22:53,81
If I take a rock, I can illustrate this


313
0:22:53,81 --> 0:22:56,94
Imagine this is the base of the ice,


314
0:22:56,94 --> 0:22:59,4
the material trapped inside the ice


315
0:22:59,4 --> 0:23:2,29
being dragged across as the glacier moved


316
0:23:2,29 --> 0:23:5,85
to produce this very distinctive marks in the surface


317
0:23:5,85 --> 0:23:8,62
This is just like sandpaper over wood,


318
0:23:8,62 --> 0:23:11,32
the same erosive effect


319
0:23:11,32 --> 0:23:14,53
The erosive process that's happening on this boulder


320
0:23:14,53 --> 0:23:17,73
is the same process that's happening on a much larger scale


321
0:23:17,73 --> 0:23:20,1
along the surface of these valleys


322
0:23:20,1 --> 0:23:23,64
The glacier is responsible for literally carving the landscape,


323
0:23:23,64 --> 0:23:27,8
producing very distinctive throughs and basins


324
0:23:27,8 --> 0:23:29,31
which were formerly infilled with solid rock


325
0:23:29,31 --> 0:23:35,23
This really testifies the erosive power of a glacier


326
0:23:35,23 --> 0:23:37,5
The ancient fjords on the north coast


327
0:23:37,5 --> 0:23:40,76
are the same deep-basin shape


328
0:23:40,76 --> 0:23:46,26
Which means they must once have been filled with ice


329
0:23:46,26 --> 0:23:49,86
Scientists now know that around 1,5 million years ago


330
0:23:49,86 --> 0:23:53,26
changes in the earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis


331
0:23:53,26 --> 0:23:57,5
began to cool the planet


332
0:23:57,5 --> 0:24:0,31
An enormous ice sheet descended from the north


333
0:24:0,31 --> 0:24:5,55
and shrouded Iceland in a cloak of ice


334
0:24:5,55 --> 0:24:7,56
As the ice advanced and retreated,


335
0:24:7,56 --> 0:24:9,56
it carved out deep fjords


336
0:24:9,56 --> 0:24:14,14
and indented Iceland's northern coastline


337
0:24:14,14 --> 0:24:16,96
Ice was a formidable force in Iceland


338
0:24:16,96 --> 0:24:22,4
and many volcanoes laid at tomb beneath it


339
0:24:22,4 --> 0:24:27,2
Fire and ice were now locked in a titanic battle of supremacy


340
0:24:27,2 --> 0:24:30,18
When the giant ice sheets that carved the fjords


341
0:24:30,18 --> 0:24:39,76
put out the fires that created Iceland


342
0:24:39,76 --> 0:24:45,8
The first clue lies in this ancient valley, 5 miles (8 Km) west of the glacier


343
0:24:45,8 --> 0:24:49,47
The valley floor is strewed with hundreds of giant boulders


344
0:24:49,47 --> 0:24:54,25
but it's how they got here that interests Dr. Roberts


345
0:24:54,25 --> 0:24:58,58
These boulders provide a lot of insight into how this landscape was formed


346
0:24:58,58 --> 0:25:1,29
The boulders clusted together and, interestingly,


347
0:25:1,29 --> 0:25:4,75
this boulders are rounded, which shows they've been rolling


348
0:25:4,75 --> 0:25:8,31
And the boulders have been brought together by some dynamical force


349
0:25:8,31 --> 0:25:11,39
We can also see smaller boulders trapped in the center


350
0:25:11,39 --> 0:25:14,53
And it's quite clear that flowing water is the cause of this


351
0:25:14,53 --> 0:25:18,73
But this would haven't been water in the stream that we see in the background


352
0:25:18,73 --> 0:25:23,5
this would have been water produced by a much larger, faster flow


353
0:25:23,5 --> 0:25:26,78
that would have inundated this entire valley


354
0:25:26,78 --> 0:25:31,54
Dr. Roberts has an extraordinay theory about what happened here:


355
0:25:31,54 --> 0:25:38,37
In ancient times, a cataclysmic flood 100 feet (30 m) high cut through this valley


356
0:25:38,37 --> 0:25:42,69
It was so powerful that it rolled this giant boulders like pebbles in a stream


357
0:25:42,69 --> 0:25:48,8
before dumping them on the landscape


358
0:25:48,8 --> 0:25:53,25
But what could create such a colossal flow of water?


359
0:25:53,25 --> 0:25:57,69
Dr. Roberts suspects the flood came from the mighty Vatnajökull glacier


360
0:25:57,69 --> 0:26:1,9
and he's hunting for clues


361
0:26:1,9 --> 0:26:12,94
With such a huge area to cover, Dr. Roberts takes to the air


362
0:26:12,94 --> 0:26:18,35
His investigation leads him to a crucial peace of evidence:


363
0:26:18,35 --> 0:26:23,35
This strange bowl-like depression on the surface of the ice


364
0:26:23,35 --> 0:26:27,76
This is an amazing location. This giant depression in the ice has been formed


365
0:26:27,76 --> 0:26:32,24
as a pocket of water drained from beneath the base of the ice cap


366
0:26:32,24 --> 0:26:36,33
The beautiful concentric crevasses that you see on the ice surface were formed


367
0:26:36,33 --> 0:26:45,72
as the ice slowly crept into the hole of this pit created as the waters drained the way


368
0:26:45,72 --> 0:26:49,22
Beneath the ice, a dynamic process is happening


369
0:26:49,22 --> 0:26:54,74
Hot magma and steam are melting the glacier from underneath


370
0:26:54,74 --> 0:27:0,24
The meltwater collects in a huge ice basin at the top of the volcano


371
0:27:0,24 --> 0:27:8,44
The basin slowly fills. But as it does, the surrounding ice becomes unstable,


372
0:27:8,44 --> 0:27:12,1
cracks up here, in the ice basin. And as the hot water drains away, 


373
0:27:12,1 --> 0:27:18,89
it forms a tunnel which channels the water to the edge of the glacier


374
0:27:18,89 --> 0:27:26,69
This would suggest that volcanic eruptions still happen even under the enormous weight of ice


375
0:27:26,69 --> 0:27:32,26
Is this process the key to explaining the ancient cataclysmic flood?


376
0:27:32,26 --> 0:27:38,59
To answer this, we must go to one of Iceland's largest volcanoes:


377
0:27:38,59 --> 0:27:41,7
Grímsvötn


378
0:27:41,7 --> 0:27:44,91
Lying entombed beneath the ice in the heart of Vatnajökull


379
0:27:44,91 --> 0:27:51,19
This massive volcano violently erupts every 10 years


380
0:27:51,19 --> 0:27:59,49
Here fire and ice spectacularly collide, with Iceland's volcanoes emerging victorious


381
0:27:59,49 --> 0:28:3,48
Ice cannot supress the invincible power of Iceland's volcanoes


382
0:28:3,48 --> 0:28:9,16
which have now found a new way to vent their anger


383
0:28:9,16 --> 0:28:13,62
During a huge eruption like this, Grímsvötn can melt enough ice


384
0:28:13,62 --> 0:28:18,56
to fill America's largest man-made reservoir: Lake Mead


385
0:28:18,56 --> 0:28:22,77
But this vast volume of water cannot be held back by the ice for long


386
0:28:22,77 --> 0:28:28,13
and leads inevitabily to a massive glacial flood


387
0:28:28,13 --> 0:28:34,83
Such a force of nature struck Iceland in 1996 with devastating consequences,


388
0:28:34,83 --> 0:28:40,27
the floodwater taking out everyting in its path


389
0:28:40,27 --> 0:28:43,23
Bridges were torn down and swept away


390
0:28:43,23 --> 0:28:48,4
and the highway was submerged under water


391
0:28:48,4 --> 0:28:54,35
The flood itself reached a peak discharge of over 1,8 million cubic feet per second (50.000 m3/s),


392
0:28:54,35 --> 0:28:59,9
that's a remarkable discharge, prevalent to the summertime discharge of the river Amazon


393
0:28:59,9 --> 0:29:5,24
Imagine that sort of condition over a relatively small area


394
0:29:5,24 --> 0:29:11,2
The sheer force of the water carried icebergs the size of 4 storey buildings


395
0:29:11,2 --> 0:29:17,36
It's floods like these that can change the landscape in a matter of days


396
0:29:17,36 --> 0:29:21,96
The erosive power of the flowing water can result in tremendous amounts of rock


397
0:29:21,96 --> 0:29:27,84
being eroded, literally being fractured away by the high water pressure that is being created


398
0:29:27,84 --> 0:29:35,2
so, literally a landscape can form before your eyes during a very severe glacial flood


399
0:29:35,2 --> 0:29:40,82
The story of Iceland's bizarre landscape is taking shape


400
0:29:40,82 --> 0:29:44,65
Striations on rock prove that ice is a formidable force


401
0:29:44,65 --> 0:29:48,82
that carved out Iceland's unique coastline


402
0:29:48,82 --> 0:29:51,6
Boulders strewn in an empty valley


403
0:29:51,6 --> 0:29:54,59
reveal cataclysmic floods of the past


404
0:29:54,59 --> 0:30:1,29
And depressions in the ice confirm that Iceland's volcanoes could not be supressed


405
0:30:1,29 --> 0:30:4,64
But 12.000 years ago the great ice sheets retreated


406
0:30:4,64 --> 0:30:8,42
and Iceland was liberated from their wintery grip,


407
0:30:8,42 --> 0:30:19,18
Now, the effects of Iceland's volcanoes would be felt on a global scale


408
0:30:19,18 --> 0:30:25,96
For thusands of years Iceland's volcanoes were locked in a titanic battle with ice


409
0:30:25,96 --> 0:30:32,73
But then, 12.000 years ago, the giant ice sheets finally retreated


410
0:30:32,73 --> 0:30:36,71
This would open a new chapter in Iceland's volcanic history,


411
0:30:36,71 --> 0:30:40,51
as they were now free to wreak havoc


412
0:30:40,51 --> 0:30:47,35
But, what effect would this have on Iceland and its surroundings?


413
0:30:47,35 --> 0:30:55,19
One of the most dramatic effects can be found in the south-central region of the island


414
0:30:55,19 --> 0:31:1,6
This alien landscape is known as Laki


415
0:31:1,6 --> 0:31:4,13
A road of strange craters and solidified lava flows


416
0:31:4,13 --> 0:31:8,8
that have bubbled up from a huge tear in the earth


417
0:31:8,8 --> 0:31:19,85
A massive fissure eruption, it stretches for an astounding 16 miles (25 Km) across the landscape


418
0:31:19,85 --> 0:31:23,38
Volcanologist Dr. Thor Thordarson is investigating Laki,


419
0:31:23,38 --> 0:31:27,14
the site of one of the greatest eruptions in recent history,


420
0:31:27,14 --> 0:31:31,75
one which would have devastating effects worldwide


421
0:31:31,75 --> 0:31:36,12
The Laki fissures, which extend from here in the southwest,


422
0:31:36,12 --> 0:31:42,26
continue here through the landscape as roll cones, up in through Mount Laki


423
0:31:42,26 --> 0:31:44,36
which was split into 2 during the eruption


424
0:31:44,36 --> 0:31:52,75
and continue futher to the northeast all the way to the margins of the glaciers here


425
0:31:52,75 --> 0:31:58,5
Eyewitness accounts accurately date the eruption to 1783


426
0:31:58,5 --> 0:32:3,5
This was one of the most disastrous years in Icelandic history


427
0:32:3,5 --> 0:32:8,32
Fallout from the eruption caused harvests all over the island to fail


428
0:32:8,32 --> 0:32:18,9
75% of the livestock died, plunging Iceland into a great famine which killed 10.000 people


429
0:32:18,9 --> 0:32:22,95
But mysteriously, at the same time the rest of the northern hemisphere


430
0:32:22,95 --> 0:32:27,4
reported freakishly cold weather


431
0:32:27,4 --> 0:32:35,96
Averaging 2,3 ºF (1,28ºC) below normal, the northern hemisphere froze over


432
0:32:35,96 --> 0:32:38,46
The North Sea along the coast of Holland froze,


433
0:32:38,46 --> 0:32:41,13
so people skated between villages along the coast


434
0:32:41,13 --> 0:32:49,43
There was on Mississippi down by New Orleans in that winter


435
0:32:49,43 --> 0:32:55,71
For many years it was thought the Laki eruption and this climatic events were unrelated,


436
0:32:55,71 --> 0:33:1,68
but advances in geology found it wasn't just a bizarre coincidence


437
0:33:1,68 --> 0:33:5,19
Comparing eyewitness accounts with the geological remains


438
0:33:5,19 --> 0:33:11,46
Dr. Thordarson has reconstructed what happened


439
0:33:11,46 --> 0:33:17,8
He discovered that the eruption started with a bang on the morning of June 8, 1783


440
0:33:17,8 --> 0:33:20,57
It sent rocks flying high into the air


441
0:33:20,57 --> 0:33:25,19
and ripped the earth open along a 1 mile (1,6 Km) tear


442
0:33:25,19 --> 0:33:29,4
But this was just the beginning


443
0:33:29,4 --> 0:33:36,38
3 days later, a second eruption ripped open, then a 3rd, 4th, 5th...


444
0:33:36,38 --> 0:33:41,4
In total, the earth unzipped along 10 vast tears in the crust


445
0:33:41,4 --> 0:33:46,72
erupting lava continuously for over 8 months


446
0:33:46,72 --> 0:33:50,27
The mammoth amounts of lava that poured out of the ground here


447
0:33:50,27 --> 0:33:56,28
would have buried Manhattah to a depth of 830 feet (250 m)


448
0:33:56,28 --> 0:34:0,62
But how an eruption on this small, remote island could cause climatic chaos


449
0:34:0,62 --> 0:34:7,52
thousands of miles away, remained a mystery


450
0:34:7,52 --> 0:34:10,95
The evidence that would link Laki with this worldwide catastrophe


451
0:34:10,95 --> 0:34:17,6
was locked inside these boulders


452
0:34:17,6 --> 0:34:21,1
The story is in the rocks. This rock here is part of


453
0:34:21,1 --> 0:34:25,7
the material, the magma that came out during the eruption


454
0:34:25,7 --> 0:34:28,3
These holes are cold bubbles,


455
0:34:28,3 --> 0:34:34,38
and they form as the magma raises from deep within the ground and approaches the surface


456
0:34:34,38 --> 0:34:36,14
and it really starts to boil!


457
0:34:36,14 --> 0:34:40,52
The gas, which is dissolved in the magma at depth, goes into the bubbles


458
0:34:40,52 --> 0:34:44,35
then it escapes into the atmosphere


459
0:34:44,35 --> 0:34:46,99
When this bubble rock erupted onto the surface


460
0:34:46,99 --> 0:34:54,26
it would have poured gas out into the Icelandic atmosphere


461
0:34:54,26 --> 0:35:2,18
Could this gas have caused climatic chaos across the globe?


462
0:35:2,18 --> 0:35:7,31
The identity of this gas can be found in the microscopic structure of the rock


463
0:35:7,31 --> 0:35:11,61
If you look closely at this rock, you can see a lot of white specks


464
0:35:11,61 --> 0:35:16,32
these little white specks are the crystals who grow in the magma at depth


465
0:35:16,32 --> 0:35:19,85
Sometimes this crystals, as they're growing, they would encapsulate


466
0:35:19,85 --> 0:35:24,26
pristine magma and bring it up to the surface


467
0:35:24,26 --> 0:35:30,0
Like time capsules, the white crystals contained untouched magma from deep in the earth


468
0:35:30,0 --> 0:35:34,81
locked away since 1783


469
0:35:34,81 --> 0:35:42,37
Dr. Thordarson has analysed this magma and found it to contain poisonous Sulphur Dioxide


470
0:35:42,37 --> 0:35:48,69
And because there was so much lava here, it would have released enormous amounts


471
0:35:48,69 --> 0:35:58,35
A staggering 100 million tons of Sulphur Dioxide gas was pumped into the atmosphere


472
0:35:58,35 --> 0:36:4,53
But how could gases released from Laki cause bitterly cold weather across the globe?


473
0:36:4,53 --> 0:36:12,44
The answer laid in accounts of a thick, red fog reported over Iceland in June 1783


474
0:36:12,44 --> 0:36:16,65
Within a few weeks it had been blown over London and Paris


475
0:36:16,65 --> 0:36:22,86
By July, it had dispersed across the entire northern hemisphere


476
0:36:22,86 --> 0:36:30,88
Scientists now know that the red fog was caused by the Sulphur Dioxide which rose high into the air


477
0:36:30,88 --> 0:36:36,59
Mixing with water, it created a Sulphuric Acid haze


478
0:36:36,59 --> 0:36:42,31
The haze blocked out the sun, and it sent temperatures plummeting


479
0:36:42,31 --> 0:36:47,3
As a result, the northern hemisphere endured 3 bitterly cold winters


480
0:36:47,3 --> 0:36:54,61
which brought spring floods, famine and widespread poverty to Europe


481
0:36:54,61 --> 0:36:58,56
Some historians have long believed that these climatic conditions


482
0:36:58,56 --> 0:37:6,32
triggered social and political unrest, which led to the French Revolution in 1789


483
0:37:6,32 --> 0:37:12,56
But scientists now suspect Laki had ramifications even further afield


484
0:37:12,56 --> 0:37:16,54
The cold temperatures in the north changed air currents in the south


485
0:37:16,54 --> 0:37:20,6
causing dramatic climate changes


486
0:37:20,6 --> 0:37:23,71
India was hit by a terrible drought


487
0:37:23,71 --> 0:37:30,74
People say that more than half a million people died from the drought in India


488
0:37:30,74 --> 0:37:36,41
Also, this change in atmospheric circulation caused a very cold summer in Japan


489
0:37:36,41 --> 0:37:38,1
It was cold and wet


490
0:37:38,1 --> 0:37:41,7
The rice harvest failed,


491
0:37:41,7 --> 0:37:46,28
and the result was the greatest famine in japanese history


492
0:37:46,28 --> 0:37:52,0
It is estimated that Laki killed over 2 million people worldwide,


493
0:37:52,0 --> 0:37:59,88
and was one of the most devastating volcanic eruptions in the history of mankind


494
0:37:59,88 --> 0:38:3,2
The evidence has proven that Iceland's recent volcanic history


495
0:38:3,2 --> 0:38:8,52
has had a devastating effect on the island and the rest of the world


496
0:38:8,52 --> 0:38:14,7
Enormous lava fields reveal that Laki was a gigantic eruption


497
0:38:14,7 --> 0:38:20,66
Bubbles in the rock indicate that huge volumes of gas were released from Laki


498
0:38:20,66 --> 0:38:26,7
The white crystals reveal that this gas was poisonous Sulphur Dioxide,


499
0:38:26,7 --> 0:38:33,99
evidence that Iceland's volcanoes caused climatic mayhem across the globe


500
0:38:33,99 --> 0:38:38,38
But eruptions like Laki may not be confined to the past


501
0:38:38,38 --> 0:38:42,16
Some believe that the balance between fire and ice is shifting,


502
0:38:42,16 --> 0:38:52,18
and has the potential to propel Iceland into another hell on earth


503
0:38:52,18 --> 0:38:59,47
The evidence is mounting, that Iceland has the potential to be the most lethal island on the planet


504
0:38:59,47 --> 0:39:4,32
A fearsome volcanic force lies beneath it, creating powerful volcanoes


505
0:39:4,32 --> 0:39:12,25
capable of generating gigantic lava flows and altering global climates


506
0:39:12,25 --> 0:39:16,0
Yet many of Iceland's volcanoes are covered in glaciers,


507
0:39:16,0 --> 0:39:21,26
fire and ice are held in a delicate balance


508
0:39:21,26 --> 0:39:25,0
Scientists fear if this balance were tipped the volcanoes favour,


509
0:39:25,0 --> 0:39:29,47
Iceland could become even deadlier


510
0:39:29,47 --> 0:39:32,5
If the remaining ice were to melt,


511
0:39:32,5 --> 0:39:38,41
what effect would it have on the activity of Iceland's volcanoes?


512
0:39:38,41 --> 0:39:46,18
The first clue in the investigation lies in these innocuous-looking piles of rock and rubble


513
0:39:46,18 --> 0:39:47,85
They're found all over Iceland,


514
0:39:47,85 --> 0:39:52,86
and yet this rocks don't come from a volcano


515
0:39:52,86 --> 0:39:54,17
They're Morraines:


516
0:39:54,17 --> 0:40:0,3
The geological term for rock piles deposited at the mouth of a glacier


517
0:40:0,3 --> 0:40:6,5
These deposits are evidence that the glaciers are shrinking


518
0:40:6,5 --> 0:40:10,75
Year by year, the glacier has melted and retreated back up the valley,


519
0:40:10,75 --> 0:40:19,2
leaving a Morraine like this behind


520
0:40:19,2 --> 0:40:22,99
Dr. Roberts has studied the Vatnajökull glacier for the last ten years


521
0:40:22,99 --> 0:40:26,19
and has noticed this dramatic trend


522
0:40:26,19 --> 0:40:30,36
The glacier is retreating at a remarkable rate since I've been visiting the area


523
0:40:30,36 --> 0:40:34,27
I've seen tremendous changes. The ice has retreated annually at a rate of about


524
0:40:34,27 --> 0:40:40,8
200 feet (61 m) per year. This lake over here used to be filled with ice


525
0:40:40,8 --> 0:40:42,65
I've seen the ice progressively melt, this morraine has formed,


526
0:40:42,65 --> 0:40:46,15
this whole valley has become almost bare


527
0:40:46,15 --> 0:40:52,15
Maybe in the next 20 years this whole glacier will disappear and a lake will form in that valley


528
0:40:52,15 --> 0:40:56,86
Iceland's glaciers are melting at an unprecedented rate


529
0:40:56,86 --> 0:41:1,36
With 5% of Iceland's ice caps melting in the last 40 years,


530
0:41:1,36 --> 0:41:4,74
the question that scientists are keen to understand


531
0:41:4,74 --> 0:41:12,8
is: What effect this rapid melting will have on the volcanoes that lie beneath?


532
0:41:12,8 --> 0:41:14,98
The only other time that glaciers have melted this quickly


533
0:41:14,98 --> 0:41:20,35
is when Iceland came out of the last Ice Age


534
0:41:20,35 --> 0:41:26,4
But what can past events tell us about the future?


535
0:41:26,4 --> 0:41:31,73
Geologist professor Bill McGuire is investigating how volcanic activity changed


536
0:41:31,73 --> 0:41:34,36
at the end of the last Ice Age


537
0:41:34,36 --> 0:41:38,8
And he's unearthed some surprising results


538
0:41:38,8 --> 0:41:44,7
Around about 11 or 12 thousand years ago you started to see quite rapid melting of glaciers


539
0:41:44,7 --> 0:41:45,43
in Iceland and elsewhere


540
0:41:45,43 --> 0:41:49,36
And that triggered a recognisable increase of volcanic activity,


541
0:41:49,36 --> 0:41:53,38
because you were removing this large mass of ice very, very quickly


542
0:41:53,38 --> 0:41:57,79
The rapid melting of ice kick-starts volcanic eruptions beneath


543
0:41:57,79 --> 0:42:1,53
Volcanic eruptions are triggered by the gas in the magma,


544
0:42:1,53 --> 0:42:4,6
which expands to form bubbles and the bubbles drive the eruption


545
0:42:4,6 --> 0:42:8,34
It's rather like taking the cork out of a bottle of champagne


546
0:42:8,34 --> 0:42:11,86
Now, if you have a very heavy weight on top of a volcano,


547
0:42:11,86 --> 0:42:13,96
if it's a heavy mass of water or ice,


548
0:42:13,96 --> 0:42:18,41
that can help supress eruptive activity


549
0:42:18,41 --> 0:42:22,98
But when ice melts quickly, this downward pressure is suddenly released


550
0:42:22,98 --> 0:42:26,82
and that's when the trouble starts


551
0:42:26,82 --> 0:42:30,51
As the ice melts, so the pressure on the magma underneath is reduced,


552
0:42:30,51 --> 0:42:34,86
the gas in the magma can form bubbles, they can coalesce and they can eventually


553
0:42:34,86 --> 0:42:37,73
drive the magma upwards towards the surface and trigger


554
0:42:37,73 --> 0:42:45,68
other explosive eruptions or effusions of lava that are spared out at a huge distances


555
0:42:45,68 --> 0:42:49,13
Iceland's glaciers are melting rapidly


556
0:42:49,13 --> 0:42:54,22
This has led scientists to believe that a devastating eruption on the scale of Laki


557
0:42:54,22 --> 0:42:55,82
could happen again


558
0:42:55,82 --> 0:42:59,71
The question is WHEN? These are things that we have to think about


559
0:42:59,71 --> 0:43:5,32
and try to prepare ourselves to deal with if they happen in our lifetime


560
0:43:5,32 --> 0:43:11,1
Is it possible that we can get another eruption like this in Iceland?


561
0:43:11,1 --> 0:43:13,66
Definetely


562
0:43:13,66 --> 0:43:22,34
The investigation has revealed how the vast and voilent island of Iceland was formed


563
0:43:22,34 --> 0:43:26,61
Cracks in the Thingvellir plane and traces of chemicals in the rocks


564
0:43:26,61 --> 0:43:36,43
revealed how the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Hot Spot joined forces to create a collossal volcanic force


565
0:43:36,43 --> 0:43:40,37
Massive fissure eruptions ripped the land open


566
0:43:40,37 --> 0:43:46,28
Hemorrhaging millions of tons of lava, Iceland rapidly formed


567
0:43:46,28 --> 0:43:50,83
Deep northern fjords were evidence that a giant ice sheet eroded the land 


568
0:43:50,83 --> 0:43:58,96
and entombed the volcanoes, locking fire and ice in a titanic battle


569
0:43:58,96 --> 0:44:4,9
Boulders strewn in an ancient valley reveal how fire emerged victorious


570
0:44:4,9 --> 0:44:8,65
unleashing cataclysmic floods


571
0:44:8,65 --> 0:44:12,85
And specks of Sulphur in the rocks showed how Iceland's volcanoes


572
0:44:12,85 --> 0:44:17,74
have the potential to cause global destruction


573
0:44:17,74 --> 0:44:22,23
Now, glaciers melting above some of the world's most deadly volcanoes


574
0:44:22,23 --> 0:44:29,68
are increasing the threat of future eruptions


575
0:44:29,68 --> 0:44:33,96
Over the last 20 million years, Iceland's almighty volcanic force


576
0:44:33,96 --> 0:44:38,85
has created a vast, alien landscape


577
0:44:38,85 --> 0:44:43,79
Volatile and unpredictable, it may one day unleash a massive eruption


578
0:44:43,79 --> 0:44:50,3
which could devastate both Iceland and a wider world beyond


579
0:44:50,3 --> 0:46:50,3
