###174 WADE DAVIS: The first thing you have to do when you even
###176 begin to try to understand a phenomenon like the Haitian
###179 zombie, which is just one thread woven through the
###182 fabric of this amazing culture, is to sort of
###185 eliminate from your consciousness all your
###187 preconceptions.
###189 HAMILTON MORRIS: In 1982, Harvard ethnobotanist Wade
###192 Davis traveled to Port-au-Prince to investigate
###195 the biological underpinnings of the Haitian zombie.
###198 As early as 1938, Zora Neale Hurston found there was a
###202 vodou potion that could induce a death-like state, though she
###206 concluded the ingredients were so guarded, no sorcerer would
###209 ever reveal them.
###211 Wade Davis did what Hurston thought impossible.
###214 And over the course of four years he gained the trust of
###217 several vodou sorcerers, uncovering the ingredients of
###220 the secret potion, and documenting his experience in
###223 the 1985 bestseller "The Serpent and the Rainbow."
###228 Though Davis is quick to say he's not a "zombieologist,"
###231 he's still considered the world's leading authority on
###235 the Haitian Zombie.
###237 WADE DAVIS: Now what is a zombie?
###239 A zombie, by folk belief, is the living dead.
###242 It's an individual who has been brought to his demise by
###245 sorcery, passed through the grave, or at least passed
###249 through a state of death, and then somehow magically
###254 resuscitated.
###256 Zombies were almost deemed to be off-limits for serious
###261 academic research.
###263 But Lamarque Douyon had found this really extraordinary case
###267 of this man called Clairvius Narcisse.
###270 What made the case unique is that Narcisse had been
###274 pronounced dead in the Schweitzer Hospital.
###276 And his death had been witnessed by two physicians,
###279 both American trained, one an American.
###282 There were impeccable records describing his pathology at
###286 the time of his demise.
###288 18 years later, this man claiming to be Clairvius
###292 Narcisse turns up in his home village, claiming that he'd
###296 been made a zombie.
###298 All these lines of evidence led Lamarque Douyon to go
###302 public in about 1980, '81, saying that they had found the
###307 first medically-verifiable instance of a zombie.
###311 That kind of opening brought everybody back to a series of
###316 reports that had existed in the folk literature of the
###320 reputed existence of a folk poison that was said to bring
###323 on a state of apparent death so profound that it could fool
###326 a physician.
###327 Lamarque Douyon had tried for some time to secure the
###330 formula of that preparation, to no avail.
###334 And that's why I was brought into the investigation.
###337 Schultes, my professor, the man who sparked the
###342 Psychedelic Movement, he was very much my mentor.
###345 I was working in the Amazon, and one day he summoned me to
###348 his fourth-floor aerie at the botanical museum and asked me
###351 if I wanted to go down to Haiti for two weeks over
###355 spring break and try to find the formula of the drug used
###358 to make zombies.
###359 Well naturally, I said, sure.
###361 There are lots of plants and lots of animals that are
###363 poisonous and that can kill you.
###365 We weren't just looking for a toxin that could kill.
###367 We were looking for a toxin that could bring on a state of
###370 apparent death so profound that it would bring someone
###372 literally to the edge of death, a threshold from which
###375 they could then recover.
###377 And I went down to Haiti and was able to secure the formula
###380 of the preparation.
###382 HAMILTON MORRIS: The preparation contains a
###383 veritable Whitman's Sampler of poisons, showcasing the great
###388 diversity of Haiti's medicinal flora and fauna, spanning two
###392 kingdoms and eight Linnaean classes.
###395 The potions Davis collected included such ingredients as
###399 datura stramonium, velvet bean, cane toad, pufferfish
###405 Hispaniolan boa, bearded fireworm, tarantula, cashew
###411 leaves, and the bones of a human child.
###415 To the sorcerer who mixes the potions, each ingredient
###419 serves a distinct purpose, with the human bones playing a
###422 role every bit as important as the psychoactive plants.
###427 But to Davis, two ingredients held the key to understanding
###431 the phenomenon of zombification.
###434 The pufferfish contains a chemical called
###436 tetrodotoxin, or TTX.
###439 If administered in the correct dose, the victim will find
###441 themselves trapped in a flaccid paralysis, perfectly
###445 mimicking the appearance of death.
###447 Upon their exhumation, the victim is fed a paste of
###451 datura stramonium, which obliterates their memory,
###453 leaving them in a stupefied, obedient delirium.
###458 WADE DAVIS: We never could prove really anything, but we
###462 could show that this was something that had a kind of
###465 coherence within the worldview of the Haitian people.
###470 If it could not be absolutely proven, it was at least so
###473 provocative that it demanded investigation.
###477 If you eliminate the other possibilities, you have to
###479 allow the facts to speak for themselves.
###482 And that's why I was prepared to say very strongly that I
###485 thought this phenomenon existed.
###487 
###491 HAMILTON MORRIS: In the years since the publication of
###493 Davis's work, there's been little formal investigation of
###497 the zombie phenomenon.
###498 Though teams of scientists and anthropologists have traveled
###501 to Haiti in search of answers, they often failed to find what
###505 they're looking for.
###506 Some have been fooled in elaborate hoaxes, or found
###510 that the zombies could be explained medically, with
###512 conditions such as schizophrenia.
###514 And others have been imprisoned or sent home with
###517 nothing at all.
###518 In Haiti, the use of this powder is a crime on par with
###522 murder, and those who concoct it do so with the knowledge
###526 that it will be used to destroy a human life.
###531 In light of all this uncertainty, I will travel to
###534 Haiti to investigate the zombie and attempt to collect
###537 poison samples for the first chemical analysis
###540 in almost 30 years.
###543 My results could support Davis's theory or redefine our
###547 concept of the Haitian zombie.
###550 Or I could have a railroad spike
###552 driven through my scrotum.
