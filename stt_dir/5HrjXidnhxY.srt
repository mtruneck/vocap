1
0:0:2,47 --> 0:0:3,57
OKAY EVERYONE I WANT TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT


2
0:0:3,57 --> 0:0:7,49
ABOUT THE MIDTERM. THERE WILL BE A REVIEW
SESSION FOR


3
0:0:7,49 --> 0:0:11,21
THE MIDTERM AND I POSTED IT TO YOUR LEFT.
ON THE TOP


4
0:0:11,21 --> 0:0:14,86
HERE THE REVIEW SESSION WILL BE HELD IN DWINELLE
AND


5
0:0:14,86 --> 0:0:17,31
IT IS A PART OF GETTING ROOM IN TIME AS YOU
GUYS CAN


6
0:0:17,31 --> 0:0:20,8
PROBABLY GUESS, THE CAMPUS IS VERY CROWDED.
SO, IT IS


7
0:0:20,8 --> 0:0:23,329
OPEN TO ALL. IT IS A WORKING SESSION. I DON'T
HAVE


8
0:0:23,329 --> 0:0:26,19
ANYTHING PREPARED. COME WITH YOUR QUESTIONS.
I WILL


9
0:0:26,19 --> 0:0:28,199
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS EVEN IF THEY ARE QUESTIONS
THAT


10
0:0:28,199 --> 0:0:30,81
ARE ON THE EXAM. OF COURSE I WON'T TELL YOU,
BUT I


11
0:0:30,81 --> 0:0:33,39
WILL STILL ANSWER THEM. NOW ABOUT THE QUESTIONS,


12
0:0:33,39 --> 0:0:37,68
THERE ARE SAMPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE EXAM TAKEN
FROM


13
0:0:37,68 --> 0:0:41,36
PREVIOUS EXAMS POSTED ON THE WEB SITE. AGAIN,
THOSE


14
0:0:41,36 --> 0:0:43,68
ARE MOSTLY MEANT TO GIVE YOU AN INDICATION
OF


15
0:0:43,68 --> 0:0:46,94
A FORMAT. THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE AND WE WILL
TALK


16
0:0:46,94 --> 0:0:49,9
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT AS WE APPROACH
THE END OF


17
0:0:49,9 --> 0:0:51,4
THIS PORTION OF THE CLASS.


18
0:0:51,4 --> 0:0:55,69
I ALSO WANT TO SAY TO YOU THAT GIVEN SAMPLE
 QUESTIONS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME TO OFFICE


19
0:0:55,69 --> 0:0:56,37
HOURS,


20
0:0:56,37 --> 0:0:58,43
WHEN WE HAVE TALKED, I HAVE BROUGHT UP SAMPLE


21
0:0:58,43 --> 0:1:1,32
QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE DISCUSSED THEM. SO,
THERE ARE


22
0:1:1,32 --> 0:1:4,67
PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO GET AN
IDEA OF WHAT


23
0:1:4,67 --> 0:1:8,39
THE EXAM IS LIKE BEFORE YOU TAKE IT.


24
0:1:8,39 --> 0:1:10,64
THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MENTION TO YOU IS
THAT


25
0:1:10,64 --> 0:1:14,9
IF YOU ARE ILL ON THE DAY OF THE EXAM OR YOU
GET SICK,


26
0:1:14,9 --> 0:1:17,89
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EXCUSE YOU FROM THE EXAM
IS IF YOU


27
0:1:17,89 --> 0:1:20,58
HAVE A NOTE FROM THE TANG CENTER. WE CANNOT
MAKE


28
0:1:20,58 --> 0:1:24,21
A JUDGMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOUR ILLNESS
IS SEVERE


29
0:1:24,21 --> 0:1:26,74
OR NOT. BUT, WE ALWAYS TAKE THE NOTE FROM


30
0:1:26,74 --> 0:1:29,13
THE TANG CENTER. SO, IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE
ILL OR IF


31
0:1:29,13 --> 0:1:31,67
YOU ARE ILL, MAKE SURE YOU GO TO THE TANG
CENTER AND


32
0:1:31,67 --> 0:1:35,39
BRING YOUR GSI THE NOTE, OTHERWISE YOU WILL
NOT BE


33
0:1:35,39 --> 0:1:37,59
EXCUSED FROM THE EXAM AND YOU WILL HAVE MISSED
IT.


34
0:1:37,59 --> 0:1:40,549
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?


35
0:1:40,549 --> 0:1:43,53
OKAY. LAST TIME WE ENDED BY TALKING ABOUT
THE


36
0:1:43,53 --> 0:1:47,39
VASCULAR CAMBIUM. AND, WE HAD THIS LAYER OF
CELLS,


37
0:1:47,39 --> 0:1:50,74
 WHICH WE CALL THE VASCULAR CAMBIUM. AND
WE SAID TO


38
0:1:50,74 --> 0:1:53,84
THE INSIDE OF THE VASCULAR CAMBIUM WE MADE
SECONDARY


39
0:1:53,84 --> 0:2:1,61
XYLEM. AND TO THE OUTSIDE WE MADE SECONDARY
PHLOEM.


40
0:2:1,61 --> 0:2:5,57
THESE TWO CELL TYPES OF VERY DIFFERENT. THE
SECONDARY


41
0:2:5,57 --> 0:2:8,95
XYLEM CELL TYPES ARE DEAD WHEN THEY ARE FUNCTIONAL.


42
0:2:8,95 --> 0:2:12,9
THEY HAVE A LOT OF LIGAND IN THEIR WALLS.
WHEREAS,


43
0:2:12,9 --> 0:2:15,28
THE SECONDARY PHLOEM ARE CELLS THAT ARE LIVING
WHEN


44
0:2:15,28 --> 0:2:17,76
THEY ARE FUNCTIONAL. THEY HAVE LOST THEIR
NUCLEUS BUT


45
0:2:17,76 --> 0:2:21,7
THEY STILL HAVE SOME CYTOPLASMS. YET, AS DIFFERENT
AS


46
0:2:21,7 --> 0:2:24,83
THESE TWO CELL TYPES ARE FROM EACH OTHER,
THEY BOTH


47
0:2:24,83 --> 0:2:29,45
ORIGINATED FROM A COMMON CELL, VASCULAR CAMBIUM.
AND


48
0:2:29,45 --> 0:2:32,69
TODAY, WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO BEGIN THE
FIRST OF TWO


49
0:2:32,69 --> 0:2:40,87
LECTURES IN WHICH WE TALK ABOUT THE COMMITMENT
TO


50
0:2:40,87 --> 0:2:48,4
DIFFERENTIATE. WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONTROLS
AT


51
0:2:48,4 --> 0:2:51,9
LEAST AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM WHICH CAUSE A
CELL TO


52
0:2:51,9 --> 0:2:55,48
FOLLOW A PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENTAL PATHWAY
TO BECOME


53
0:2:55,48 --> 0:2:58,989
EITHER, IN THIS CASE, A SECONDARY XYLEM CELL
OR


54
0:2:58,989 --> 0:3:1,65
A SECONDARY PHLOEM CELL. AND, THIS IS A TOPIC
WHICH


55
0:3:1,65 --> 0:3:6,99
 WILL HAVE AS YOU SEE, A LOT OF IDEAS WHICH
SEEM TO


56
0:3:6,99 --> 0:3:9,99
CONTRADICT EACH OTHER, BUT IN THE END I HOPE
YOU GET


57
0:3:9,99 --> 0:3:11,849
AN APPRECIATION AND A PICTURE OF WHAT THESE
CONTROLS


58
0:3:11,849 --> 0:3:14,3
ARE LIKE OR AT LEAST WHAT WE THINK THESE CONTROLS
ARE


59
0:3:14,3 --> 0:3:14,819
LIKE.


60
0:3:14,819 --> 0:3:17,91
NOW, THE STUDIES OF THIS COMMITMENT TO


61
0:3:17,91 --> 0:3:21,569
DIFFERENTIATE BEGAN PROBABLY IN THE 19TH CENTURY
WITH


62
0:3:21,569 --> 0:3:26,76
A GERMAN BOTANIST BY THE NAME OF SACHS. SACHS


63
0:3:26,76 --> 0:3:30,709
BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE SUBSTANCES WHICH
HE CALLED


64
0:3:30,709 --> 0:3:41,19
ORGAN OR TISSUE FORMING SUBSTANCES.


65
0:3:41,19 --> 0:3:51,67
SO, HE ENVISIONED A ROOT FORMING SUBSTANCE,


66
0:3:51,67 --> 0:3:59,909
A SHOOT FORMING SUBSTANCE, ETC. SO, HE THOUGHT
THAT


67
0:3:59,909 --> 0:4:2,69
THERE WERE THESE COMPOUNDS WHICH IF THEY WERE
PUT ON


68
0:4:2,69 --> 0:4:5,12
THE PLANT OR FOUND IN A PARTICULAR REGION
OF THE


69
0:4:5,12 --> 0:4:7,48
PLANT, THEY WOULD CAUSE A ROOT TO FORM OR
CAUSE


70
0:4:7,48 --> 0:4:12,5
A SHOOT TO FORM. AND THIS WAS A WIDELY ACCEPTED
VIEW


71
0:4:12,5 --> 0:4:14,31
IN THE 19TH CENTURY, AT LEAST IN THE MIDDLE
TO THE


72
0:4:14,31 --> 0:4:18,239
EARLY 19TH CENTURY, WITHOUT REALLY ANY PROOF.
AT


73
0:4:18,239 --> 0:4:21,15
 ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT SACHS WAS COMING
UP WITH HIS


74
0:4:21,15 --> 0:4:26,33
IDEAS AND HIS HYPOTHESIS, ANOTHER WORKER WITH
WHOM ALL


75
0:4:26,33 --> 0:4:31,57
OF YOU, I BELIEVE, ARE FAMILIAR, CHARLES DARWIN
WAS


76
0:4:31,57 --> 0:4:41,12
ALSO INTERESTED IN STUDYING GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.


77
0:4:41,12 --> 0:4:44,71
AND THE WORK I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT NOW
WAS DONE


78
0:4:44,71 --> 0:4:53,57
WITH DARWIN AND WITH HIS SON FRANCIS. DARWIN,
CHARLES


79
0:4:53,57 --> 0:4:55,82
DARWIN AND HIS SON FRANCIS DARWIN WERE INTERESTED
IN


80
0:4:55,82 --> 0:5:2,61
PLANT MOVEMENTS


81
0:5:2,61 --> 0:5:8,21
OR AS THEY ARE KNOWN AS TROPISMS.


82
0:5:8,21 --> 0:5:12,3
TROPISMS. AND THE PARTICULAR TYPE OF TROPISM
OR


83
0:5:12,3 --> 0:5:14,27
MOVEMENT THAT THEY WERE INTERESTED IN, IS
ONE THAT YOU


84
0:5:14,27 --> 0:5:18,31
HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXPOSED TO. THEY WERE INTERESTED
IN


85
0:5:18,31 --> 0:5:24,71
THE BENDING


86
0:5:24,71 --> 0:5:29,99
OF PLANTS TOWARDS LIGHT. OR AS THIS IS


87
0:5:29,99 --> 0:5:37,54
KNOWN AS PHOTOTROPISM. AS YOU HAVE ALREADY
SEEN


88
0:5:37,54 --> 0:5:40,11
A RESPONSE OF AN ORGANISM TO LIGHT WHEN WE
TALKED


89
0:5:40,11 --> 0:5:43,34
ABOUT THE FUNGUS PILOBILUS IN THE VERY FIRST
LECTURE.


90
0:5:43,34 --> 0:5:46,91
IT ALREADY SHOWED PHOTOTROPISM AND IT ALSO
MOVED OR


91
0:5:46,91 --> 0:5:49,99
BENT TOWARD THE LIGHT. NOW FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS


92
0:5:49,99 --> 0:5:52,75
DARWIN AND FRANCIS DID NOT WORK WITH PILOBILUS
WITH


93
0:5:52,75 --> 0:5:57,57
 THE FUNGUS, BUT THEY WORKED WITH A GRASS
AND THEY


94
0:5:57,57 --> 0:6:2,2
WORKED WITH A PARTICULAR PORTION OF THE GRASS
SEEDLING


95
0:6:2,2 --> 0:6:5,13
THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE OR WILL BE SEEING THIS
WEEK IN


96
0:6:5,13 --> 0:6:5,99
THE LAB.


97
0:6:5,99 --> 0:6:10,639
THEY WORKED WITH THE GRASS COLEOPTILE OR THE


98
0:6:10,639 --> 0:6:16,21
SHEATH COVERING THE SHOOT JUST BEFORE THE
SHOOT


99
0:6:16,21 --> 0:6:21,2
EMERGES FROM THE SOIL. AND TO REMIND YOU OF
THE


100
0:6:21,2 --> 0:6:28,74
COLEOPTILE, IF WE HAVE A SEED. HERE IS THE
SEED. THE


101
0:6:28,74 --> 0:6:32,77
COLEOPTILE IS THE SHEATH PROTECTING THE SHOOT,
WHICH


102
0:6:32,77 --> 0:6:39,1
WOULD BE HERE.


103
0:6:39,1 --> 0:6:41,71
HERE IS THE COLEOPTILE. AND WHAT WERE


104
0:6:41,71 --> 0:6:46,139
INTERESTED IN IS THEY TOOK SEEDLINGS, LIKE
THIS ONE.


105
0:6:46,139 --> 0:6:49,96
AND WE WILL DRAW IT AGAIN. TOOK SEEDLINGS
OF GRASSES


106
0:6:49,96 --> 0:6:53,78
AND THEY GAVE IT LIGHT FROM ONE DIRECTION,
SO CALLED,


107
0:6:53,78 --> 0:7:3,24
UNILATERAL ILLUMINATION.


108
0:7:3,24 --> 0:7:4,18
SO LET'S SAY THEY GAVE IT


109
0:7:4,18 --> 0:7:8,34
LIGHT FROM THIS DIRECTION. UNILATERAL ILLUMINATION.


110
0:7:8,34 --> 0:7:12,87
AND WHAT THEY FOUND, IF THEY WAITED FOR SOME
TIME, IS


111
0:7:12,87 --> 0:7:20,18
AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE COLEOPTILE APPEAR TO
MOVE TOWARD


112
0:7:20,18 --> 0:7:28,83
THE LIGHT OR BEND TOWARD THE LIGHT.
 THIS IS PHOTOTROPISM, MOVEMENT OR BENDING


113
0:7:28,83 --> 0:7:29,22
TOWARD


114
0:7:29,22 --> 0:7:33,91
THE LIGHT. POSITIVE PHOTOTROPISM. NOW, AN
IMPORTANT


115
0:7:33,91 --> 0:7:36,56
POINT WHICH WE NEED TO MAKE ON THIS BENDING
AND WHICH


116
0:7:36,56 --> 0:7:38,819
IS GOING TO UNDERLIES WHAT WE TALK ABOUT LATER
IN


117
0:7:38,819 --> 0:7:41,319
LECTURE IS THE FOLLOWING.


118
0:7:41,319 --> 0:7:42,94
FOR THIS I WANT YOU ALL TO LOOK AT THIS AND
I


119
0:7:42,94 --> 0:7:46,96
WILL WRITE IT DOWN FOR YOU. FOR THIS BENDING
TO OCCUR


120
0:7:46,96 --> 0:7:52,16
THIS SIDE OVER HERE HAS TO GROW MORE THAN
THIS SIDE


121
0:7:52,16 --> 0:7:56,78
OVER HERE. FOR BENDING TO OCCUR ONE SIDE HAS
TO GROW


122
0:7:56,78 --> 0:8:18,569
MORE THAN THE OTHER.


123
0:8:18,569 --> 0:8:29,21
AND THIS IS KNOWN AS DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH.
THE


124
0:8:29,21 --> 0:8:31,91
TWO SIDES ARE RESPONDING IN A DIFFERENT MANNER,
THEY


125
0:8:31,91 --> 0:8:45,61
ARE GROWING IN A DIFFERENT MANNER.


126
0:8:45,61 --> 0:8:46,239
NOW, DARWIN AND


127
0:8:46,239 --> 0:8:48,999
FRANCIS DID A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS AND I WANT
TO JUST


128
0:8:48,999 --> 0:8:52,72
TELL YOU ABOUT A FEW OF THE EXPERIMENTS THEY
DID TO


129
0:8:52,72 --> 0:8:55,92
TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE BASIS OF THIS DIFFERENTIAL


130
0:8:55,92 --> 0:9:0,61
GROWTH. THE BASIS OF THIS PHOTOTROPISM. THE
FIRST


131
0:9:0,61 --> 0:9:8,799
EXPERIMENT THEY DID WAS TO ASK, WHAT PART
OF THE


132
0:9:8,799 --> 0:9:15,439
 COLEOPTILE SEES THE LIGHT? I WILL PUT SEES
IN


133
0:9:15,439 --> 0:9:23,92
QUOTES. AND, WHAT THEY DID WAS TO TAKE COLEOPTILES
IN


134
0:9:23,92 --> 0:9:28,249
SEEDLINGS AND COVER VARIOUS PORTIONS OF THEM
WITH


135
0:9:28,249 --> 0:9:30,35
BLACK CLOTH OR WHAT WAS THE EQUIVALENT TO
ALUMINUM


136
0:9:30,35 --> 0:9:36,1
FOIL IN THE 19TH CENTURY AND FIND OUT WHICH
PORTION


137
0:9:36,1 --> 0:9:39,129
WAS NECESSARY TO BE EXPOSED TO THE LIGHT IN
ORDER TO


138
0:9:39,129 --> 0:9:46,199
GET PHOTOTROPISM. AND FROM THIS WORK THEY
CONCLUDED


139
0:9:46,199 --> 0:9:55,619
THAT THE TIP RECEIVED THE LIGHT.


140
0:9:55,619 --> 0:9:56,3
AND, THEY


141
0:9:56,3 --> 0:10:2,91
HYPOTHESIZED


142
0:10:2,91 --> 0:10:5,689
THAT SOMETHING MOVED FROM THE TIP DOWN TO


143
0:10:5,689 --> 0:10:26,69
CAUSE THE DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH.


144
0:10:26,69 --> 0:10:27,489
THESE WERE VERY


145
0:10:27,489 --> 0:10:31,829
IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS AND THESE HYPOTHESIS,
THESE


146
0:10:31,829 --> 0:10:38,239
OBSERVATIONS AND MANY MORE ON PLANT MOVEMENTS
WERE


147
0:10:38,239 --> 0:10:41,339
PUBLISHED IN A BOOK. FRANCIS AND CHARLES DARWIN


148
0:10:41,339 --> 0:10:54,559
PUBLISHED IT IN A BOOK CALLED, "THE POWER
OF MOVEMENT"


149
0:10:54,559 --> 0:10:59,329
IN 1896. AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COPIES IN
OUR


150
0:10:59,329 --> 0:11:2,379
LIBRARY. IT IS A VERY FASCINATING BOOK. THEY
MAKE A


151
0:11:2,379 --> 0:11:4,939
LOT OF OBSERVATIONS. MANY OF WHICH, IN FACT,
MOST OF


152
0:11:4,939 --> 0:11:8,149
WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN FOLLOWED UP ON. SO,
THESE


153
0:11:8,149 --> 0:11:11,549
 OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE IN THE LATE 19TH
CENTURY AND


154
0:11:11,549 --> 0:11:14,389
BASICALLY THAT WAS THE END OF THE WORK ON
THEM UNTIL


155
0:11:14,389 --> 0:11:20,19
ABOUT THE 1930'S. AND IN THE 1930'S DARWIN'S


156
0:11:20,19 --> 0:11:24,54
OBSERVATIONS ON THE COLEOPTILE AND PHOTOTROPISM
WERE


157
0:11:24,54 --> 0:11:27,98
PICKED UP AGAIN IN AN ATTEMPT TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND


158
0:11:27,98 --> 0:11:31,389
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THIS PARTICULAR MECHANISM.
AND,


159
0:11:31,389 --> 0:11:35,48
THE VERY FIRST EXPERIMENTS WHICH PEOPLE DID
IN THESE


160
0:11:35,48 --> 0:11:41,1
SITUATIONS WERE THE FOLLOWING:


161
0:11:41,1 --> 0:11:45,339
THEY TOOK A COLEOPTILE, AND WE SHOULD SAY
THAT


162
0:11:45,339 --> 0:11:51,559
THIS WORK WAS DONE IN DARKNESS. IT REALLY
WASN'T


163
0:11:51,559 --> 0:11:56,1
TOTAL DARKNESS, IT WAS IN A ROOM THAT HAD
GREEN LIGHT,


164
0:11:56,1 --> 0:11:58,249
GREEN LIGHT AS FAR AS THE PLANT IS CONCERNED
IS LIKE


165
0:11:58,249 --> 0:12:2,49
DARKNESS. PLANTS DON'T REALLY RESPOND IN THIS
WAY TO


166
0:12:2,49 --> 0:12:4,889
THE GREEN LIGHT. BUT, FOR OUR PURPOSES WE
WILL SAY IT


167
0:12:4,889 --> 0:12:7,66
WAS DONE IN DARKNESS. NOW WHAT THESE PEOPLE
DID, WAS


168
0:12:7,66 --> 0:12:11,109
FIRST OF ALL TO CONFIRM DARWIN'S HYPOTHESIS
THAT


169
0:12:11,109 --> 0:12:14,639
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON IN THE TIP. THEY TOOK
THE


170
0:12:14,639 --> 0:12:18,569
COLEOPTILE AND THEY PUT A PIECE OF A FOIL,
ALUMINUM


171
0:12:18,569 --> 0:12:24,359
 FOIL BETWEEN THE TIP AND THE REST OF THE
COLEOPTILE


172
0:12:24,359 --> 0:12:32,379
AND THEN THEY GAVE IT UNILATERAL LIGHT.


173
0:12:32,379 --> 0:12:32,839
AND THEY GOT


174
0:12:32,839 --> 0:12:39,649
NO BENDING. AND THAT IS EXACTLY PARALLEL TO
WHAT


175
0:12:39,649 --> 0:12:44,23
DARWIN SHOULD BE, WHAT DARWIN PREDICTED. DARWIN
ALSO


176
0:12:44,23 --> 0:12:48,249
PREDICTED THAT THERE WAS BEING MADE IN THE
TIP AND


177
0:12:48,249 --> 0:12:50,949
THIS EXPERIMENT TENDED TO CONFIRM THAT WHEN
YOU PUT


178
0:12:50,949 --> 0:12:55,629
THE ALUMINUM FOIL BETWEEN THE TIP AND THE
REST OF THE


179
0:12:55,629 --> 0:12:59,269
COLEOPTILE, YOU PREVENTED WHATEVER WAS BEING
MADE FROM


180
0:12:59,269 --> 0:13:2,91
MOVING DOWN. SO, ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT SOMETHING
WAS


181
0:13:2,91 --> 0:13:6,739
BEING MADE, WHAT THESE INVESTIGATORS NEXT
DID WAS TO


182
0:13:6,739 --> 0:13:11,16
TAKE AGAR, SHEET THE AGAR, MOST OF YOU HAVE
SEEN AGAR


183
0:13:11,16 --> 0:13:15,459
BEFORE. AND ON THIS AGAR SHEET, TO PLACE LOTS
OF


184
0:13:15,459 --> 0:13:26,809
COLEOPTILE TIPS. SO THESE ARE COLEOPTILE ON
AGAR.


185
0:13:26,809 --> 0:13:30,73
AND THEY LET THE COLEOPTILE TIPS SIT ON THE
AGAR ON


186
0:13:30,73 --> 0:13:34,549
THE ASSUMPTION THAT WHATEVER WAS BEING MADE
BY THE


187
0:13:34,549 --> 0:13:41,509
COLEOPTILE TIPS WOULD DIFFUSE INTO THE AGAR.


188
0:13:41,509 --> 0:13:44,189
AND THEN THEY DID A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS.


189
0:13:44,189 --> 0:13:53,299
AGAIN, THESE ARE IN DARKNESS. IN DARKNESS.
THE FIRST


190
0:13:53,299 --> 0:13:57,609
 EXPERIMENT WHICH THEY DID IS THEY TOOK THE
AGAR AND


191
0:13:57,609 --> 0:14:7,129
THEY DIVIDED IT IN TO PIECES. DIVIDED IT IN
TO PIECES


192
0:14:7,129 --> 0:14:17,759
AND THEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THE COLEOPTILE TIP.
LET'S


193
0:14:17,759 --> 0:14:21,189
TALK ABOUT HOW THESE SUBSTITUTION EXPERIMENTS
LOOKED.


194
0:14:21,189 --> 0:14:25,249
IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT, AGAIN, DONE IN DARKNESS.


195
0:14:25,249 --> 0:14:31,29
THEY TOOK THE COLEOPTILE, WHICH WAS LACKING
ITS TIP,


196
0:14:31,29 --> 0:14:39,819
AND THEY PUT A BLOCK OF AGAR ON SYMMETRICALLY,


197
0:14:39,819 --> 0:14:44,109
SYMMETRICALLY. AND IF YOU WAITED FOR SOME
TIME, WHAT


198
0:14:44,109 --> 0:14:51,569
YOU FOUND IS THAT THIS GREW. GOT VERY BIG.
SO, THIS


199
0:14:51,569 --> 0:15:0,89
WAS CONTRASTED WITH THE TIP WITH NO AGAR AND
WAITED


200
0:15:0,89 --> 0:15:5,839
FOR TIME. GOT NO GROWTH. SO CLEARLY SOMETHING
WAS


201
0:15:5,839 --> 0:15:12,299
COMING FROM THE AGAR. THE NEXT SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS


202
0:15:12,299 --> 0:15:15,379
WERE A LITTLE MORE CLEVER, A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING.


203
0:15:15,379 --> 0:15:18,41
THEY WERE ALSO DONE IN DARKNESS. AND, IN THESE


204
0:15:18,41 --> 0:15:22,239
EXPERIMENTS WHAT THEY DID, IS THEY TOOK A
COLEOPTILE


205
0:15:22,239 --> 0:15:26,329
LIKE SO, COLEOPTILE LIKE SO, JUST AS YOU HAVE
SEEN


206
0:15:26,329 --> 0:15:32,449
BEFORE, AGAIN IN DARKNESS AND NOW THEY PUT
THE BLOCK


207
0:15:32,449 --> 0:15:41,689
ON ASYMMETRICALLY.


208
0:15:41,689 --> 0:15:50,279
ASYMMETRICALLY. AND THEY WAITED
 FOR SOME TIME. AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS IN


209
0:15:50,279 --> 0:15:52,919
FACT, THE


210
0:15:52,919 --> 0:15:57,359
COLEOPTILE BENT, COLEOPTILE BENT, JUST LIKE
IT WOULD


211
0:15:57,359 --> 0:16:4,72
IN THE LIGHT.


212
0:16:4,72 --> 0:16:9,479
SO FROM THIS EXPERIMENT THEY CONCLUDED


213
0:16:9,479 --> 0:16:24,619
SOMETHING MOVING ASYMMETRICALLY OUT OF THE
BLOCK.


214
0:16:24,619 --> 0:16:37,399
STIMULATING DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH.


215
0:16:37,399 --> 0:16:37,859
AND THAT IS


216
0:16:37,859 --> 0:16:41,309
PRETTY EASY TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY
AT


217
0:16:41,309 --> 0:16:44,429
THIS PICTURE HERE. BECAUSE THE BLOCK IS PLACED
ON


218
0:16:44,429 --> 0:16:48,299
ONLY PART OF THE COLEOPTILE, WHATEVER THIS


219
0:16:48,299 --> 0:16:52,29
SUBSTANCE WAS WOULD ONLY MOVE DOWN PART OF
THE


220
0:16:52,29 --> 0:16:55,959
COLEOPTILE SIDE. AND, ACCORDING TO THIS IDEA,
IT


221
0:16:55,959 --> 0:16:58,889
WOULD STIMULATE DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH ONLY ON
THE


222
0:16:58,889 --> 0:17:1,689
SIDE WHERE THE SUBSTANCE WAS IN HIGHER


223
0:17:1,689 --> 0:17:5,15
CONCENTRATION. EVERYBODY CLEAR ON THAT? FINALLY


224
0:17:5,15 --> 0:17:9,259
THEY DID A THIRD EXPERIMENT WITH THESE COLEOPTILES.


225
0:17:9,259 --> 0:17:18,919
AND THIS WAS NOW DONE IN USING UNILATERAL
LIGHT.


226
0:17:18,919 --> 0:17:22,23
AND THIS EXPERIMENT THEY TOOK AGAIN THE COLEOPTILE,


227
0:17:22,23 --> 0:17:28,0
THEY HAD TAKEN OFF THE ORIGINAL TIP, THEY
PUT THE


228
0:17:28,0 --> 0:17:36,139
BLOCK ON SYMMETRICALLY NOW,


229
0:17:36,139 --> 0:17:41,47
AND NOW THEY DID
 SOMETHING VERY CLEVER. THEY GAVE IT UNILATERAL


230
0:17:41,47 --> 0:17:52,279
LIGHT. THEY GAVE IT UNILATERAL LIGHT. IN THIS


231
0:17:52,279 --> 0:17:56,87
PARTICULAR EXPERIMENT, IN THIS PARTICULAR


232
0:17:56,87 --> 0:18:2,72
EXPERIMENT, WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE COLEOPTILE


233
0:18:2,72 --> 0:18:5,48
BENT TOWARD THE LIGHT, EVEN THOUGH THE BLOCK
WAS ON


234
0:18:5,48 --> 0:18:10,98
SYMMETRICALLY, IT BENT TOWARD THE LIGHT. IF


235
0:18:10,98 --> 0:18:18,679
A SUBSTANCE IS BEING PRODUCED SYMMETRICALLY,
YOU


236
0:18:18,679 --> 0:18:22,559
WOULD EXPECT THE COLEOPTILE TO GROW STRAIGHT
IF YOU


237
0:18:22,559 --> 0:18:24,639
PUT IT IN THE LIGHT, IF THE SUBSTANCE IS BEING


238
0:18:24,639 --> 0:18:28,45
PRODUCED SYMMETRICALLY. BUT, IN FACT, WHAT
THEY


239
0:18:28,45 --> 0:18:30,639
FOUND WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE PUTTING
THE


240
0:18:30,639 --> 0:18:35,49
SUBSTANCE ON SYMMETRICALLY, THE COLEOPTILE
BENT.


241
0:18:35,49 --> 0:18:41,84
AND SO FROM THIS EXPERIMENT, THEY CONCLUDED
THAT


242
0:18:41,84 --> 0:18:58,19
LIGHT WAS CAUSING THE MOVEMENT OF THIS SUBSTANCE
TO


243
0:18:58,19 --> 0:19:22,6
THE SIDE OF THE COLEOPTILE AWAY FROM THE LIGHT.


244
0:19:22,6 --> 0:19:22,649
IN


245
0:19:22,649 --> 0:19:25,539
THIS SCENARIO THEN, WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE, AND
I AM


246
0:19:25,539 --> 0:19:27,75
JUST GOING TO DRAW THIS FOR YOU, IN THIS SCENARIO


247
0:19:27,75 --> 0:19:31,419
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE IS, YOU WOULD HAVE MORE
OF THIS


248
0:19:31,419 --> 0:19:42,63
 SUBSTANCE, MORE SUBSTANCE ON THE DARK SIDE.
AND


249
0:19:42,63 --> 0:19:45,23
THIS IS WHY THE COLEOPTILE BENT, BECAUSE HERE
YOU


250
0:19:45,23 --> 0:19:52,779
HAD MORE GROWTH. THESE ARE VERY CENTRAL AND


251
0:19:52,779 --> 0:19:56,62
IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTS. WHAT IS THIS SUBSTANCE?


252
0:19:56,62 --> 0:19:59,409
OF COURSE, ONCE WE DEMONSTRATED SOME OF THE


253
0:19:59,409 --> 0:20:2,13
PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERS PEOPLE BEGAN TO LOOK
FOR


254
0:20:2,13 --> 0:20:5,71
WHAT IT WAS. THE AGAR WAS ANALYZED, CHEMICALLY,


255
0:20:5,71 --> 0:20:15,36
AND OUT OF THE AGAR A COMPOUND INDOLE-3-ACETIC
ACID


256
0:20:15,36 --> 0:20:21,909
OR ABBREVIATED AS IAA OR THE COMMON NAME IS
AUXIN


257
0:20:21,909 --> 0:20:25,169
WAS IDENTIFIED. THIS IS A LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT


258
0:20:25,169 --> 0:20:30,2
COMPOUND ABOUT LESS THAN 200 IN MOLECULAR
WEIGHT.


259
0:20:30,2 --> 0:20:35,48
IT WORKS IN LOW CONCENTRATIONS. WORKS IN LOW


260
0:20:35,48 --> 0:20:40,72
CONCENTRATION AND AS WE SHOWED FROM BOTH THE
INTACT


261
0:20:40,72 --> 0:20:42,639
AND FROM THE EXPERIMENTS WHERE WE PUT THE


262
0:20:42,639 --> 0:20:46,37
ASYMMETRIC BLOCK ON, THE RESPONSE IS SOMEPLACE


263
0:20:46,37 --> 0:20:49,799
DIFFERENT FROM WHERE THE SUBSTANCE IS PRODUCED.


264
0:20:49,799 --> 0:20:57,5
SO, WE HAVE A DIFFERENT, A DIFFERENT REGIONS
OF


265
0:20:57,5 --> 0:21:6,69
PRODUCTION AND RESPONSE. THE CHARACTERISTICS
OF


266
0:21:6,69 --> 0:21:10,169
 THE MOLECULE WHICH WORK IN LOW CONCENTRATIONS
AND


267
0:21:10,169 --> 0:21:13,659
HAVE A REGION WHICH SYNTHESIZED AND WHICH
DIFFERS


268
0:21:13,659 --> 0:21:15,559
FROM THE REGION WHERE IT ACTUALLY CAUSES


269
0:21:15,559 --> 0:21:21,629
A RESPONSE, BASICALLY DEFINES A HORMONE. AND
SO IN


270
0:21:21,629 --> 0:21:24,299
THE BEGINNING THE TERM HORMONE WAS APPLIED
TO


271
0:21:24,299 --> 0:21:28,97
AUXIN. BUT MOST PLANT BIOLOGISTS NOW PREFER
NOT TO


272
0:21:28,97 --> 0:21:32,139
USE THE WORD HORMONE, BUT INSTEAD CONSIDER
AUXIN


273
0:21:32,139 --> 0:21:34,269
AND OTHER MOLECULES LIKE IT THAT WE WILL TALK


274
0:21:34,269 --> 0:21:43,82
ABOUT, PLANT GROWTH REGULATOR. AUXIN WAS THE
FIRST


275
0:21:43,82 --> 0:21:47,39
DISCOVERED PLANT GROWTH REGULATOR. IT CAUSES
MANY,


276
0:21:47,39 --> 0:21:50,669
MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF EFFECTS IN PLANTS.
AND


277
0:21:50,669 --> 0:21:54,299
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO NOW IS TO GIVE YOU
A TABLE


278
0:21:54,299 --> 0:21:57,899
WITH SOME OF THE MORE PROMINENT EFFECTS OF
AUXIN ON


279
0:21:57,899 --> 0:22:0,46
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. BUT THESE ARE REALLY
ONLY


280
0:22:0,46 --> 0:22:4,9
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. THE FIRST EFFECT IS
KNOWN


281
0:22:4,9 --> 0:22:13,279
AS APICAL DOMINANCE. IF YOU LOOK AT A TREE
WHAT


282
0:22:13,279 --> 0:22:16,83
YOU WILL FIND IS THE BRANCHES NEAREST THE
TIP OF


283
0:22:16,83 --> 0:22:20,929
THE TREE GROW OUT, NEAREST THE TIP OF THE
TREE.


284
0:22:20,929 --> 0:22:25,909
 A TYPICAL TREE LIKE SO. BRANCHES NEAR THE
TOP OF


285
0:22:25,909 --> 0:22:28,46
THE TREE DO NOT GROW OUT. WHEREAS, BRANCHES
TOWARD


286
0:22:28,46 --> 0:22:32,919
THE BOTTOM DO GROW OUT. BRANCHES AT THE TOP
ARE


287
0:22:32,919 --> 0:22:43,279
INHIBITED.


288
0:22:43,279 --> 0:22:46,49
THIS INHIBITION COMES ABOUT AND YOUR


289
0:22:46,49 --> 0:22:48,919
BOOK DISCUSSES THIS IN MORE DETAIL, COMES
ABOUT


290
0:22:48,919 --> 0:23:0,47
BECAUSE THE APEX MAKES AUXIN. AND THIS INHIBITS


291
0:23:0,47 --> 0:23:11,39
AXILLARY BUDS FROM GROWING OUT.


292
0:23:11,39 --> 0:23:13,44
AND HERE WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES OF APICAL


293
0:23:13,44 --> 0:23:16,399
DOMINANCE. THIS IS AM IMPATIENCE PLANT GROWING
HERE


294
0:23:16,399 --> 0:23:19,99
ON THE CAMPUS. IN THIS PARTICULAR PLANT, THE
APEX,


295
0:23:19,99 --> 0:23:23,8
WHICH IS UP HIGHER AT THE TIP, HAS STRONG
APICAL


296
0:23:23,8 --> 0:23:25,519
DOMINANCE. AUXIN IS BEING PRODUCED AND IT
IS MOVING


297
0:23:25,519 --> 0:23:29,47
DOWN THE STEM AND IT IS INHIBITING APICAL
DOMINANCE.


298
0:23:29,47 --> 0:23:32,889
IF WE TAKE OFF THIS TIP, THAT IS, WE REMOVE
THE SUPPLY


299
0:23:32,889 --> 0:23:36,559
OF AUXIN OR AS HAPPENS IN NATURE, BY ACCIDENTS


300
0:23:36,559 --> 0:23:39,86
SOMETIMES THE TIP BREAKS OFF, YOU CAN CAUSE
THE


301
0:23:39,86 --> 0:23:43,259
AXILLARY BUDS TO BECOME ACTIVE. AND THEY GROW
OUT.


302
0:23:43,259 --> 0:23:45,769
EACH OF THESE AXILLARY BUDS THEN HAS ITS OWN
APEX.


303
0:23:45,769 --> 0:23:49,159
 BEGINS TO MAKE ITS OWN AUXIN AND WILL INHIBIT
THE


304
0:23:49,159 --> 0:23:52,159
AXILLARY BUDS FROM GROWING OUT. APICAL DOMINANCE
IS


305
0:23:52,159 --> 0:23:57,8
ONE OF THE PRIME CHARACTERISTICS OF AUXIN.
A SECOND


306
0:23:57,8 --> 0:24:3,83
CHARACTERISTIC OF AUXIN IS THAT IT ACTIVATES
AND


307
0:24:3,83 --> 0:24:16,9
CONTROLS DIFFERENTIATION OF THE VASCULAR CAMBIUM.
AND


308
0:24:16,9 --> 0:24:19,59
WE HAVE SEEN THIS WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE VASCULAR


309
0:24:19,59 --> 0:24:21,279
CAMBIUM, ALTHOUGH WE DIDN'T EXPLAIN WHAT THE
BASIS OF


310
0:24:21,279 --> 0:24:26,429
IT WAS. A THIRD ASPECT OF AUXIN, WHICH IS
A MAJOR ONE


311
0:24:26,429 --> 0:24:29,7
THAT WE WON'T TALK A LOT TODAY BUT WE WILL
TALK ABOUT


312
0:24:29,7 --> 0:24:34,34
MORE IN ANOTHER LECTURE, IS THAT AUXIN EFFECTS
FRUIT


313
0:24:34,34 --> 0:24:44,49
DEVELOPMENT.


314
0:24:44,49 --> 0:24:47,23
A FOURTH MAJOR CATEGORY OF AUXIN EFFECTS


315
0:24:47,23 --> 0:24:56,389
INCLUDE THE FACT THAT AUXIN STIMULATES THE
PERICYCLE


316
0:24:56,389 --> 0:25:3,749
TO MAKE LATERAL ROOTS. TO MAKE LATERAL ROOTS.


317
0:25:3,749 --> 0:25:7,8
SO, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GARDENERS AND
YOU


318
0:25:7,8 --> 0:25:11,94
HAVE A CUTTING WHERE YOU TAKE A SHOOT OFF
OF A PLANT


319
0:25:11,94 --> 0:25:14,11
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROPAGATE, LIKE WE
TAKE THIS


320
0:25:14,11 --> 0:25:17,39
SHOOT OFF AND WE WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS TO
FORM ROOTS.


321
0:25:17,39 --> 0:25:20,89
YOU CAN BUY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SYNTHETIC
AUXINS.


322
0:25:20,89 --> 0:25:24,539
 THIS IS CALLED RUT ONE. IN WHICH YOU DIP
THE PLANT


323
0:25:24,539 --> 0:25:27,98
INTO THE POWDER AND THIS STIMULATES THE PRODUCTION
OF


324
0:25:27,98 --> 0:25:31,259
A PERICYCLE WITH LATERAL ROOT FORMATION. EVENTUALLY


325
0:25:31,259 --> 0:25:34,269
YOU MIGHT GET NEW ROOTS FORMING BUT THEY WOULD
TAKE A


326
0:25:34,269 --> 0:25:38,999
LONGER TIME. SO, AUXIN STIMULATES ROOT FORMULATION.


327
0:25:38,999 --> 0:25:45,519
A 5TH MAJOR CATEGORY OF AUXIN EFFECTS IS THAT
AUXIN


328
0:25:45,519 --> 0:25:51,249
AFFECTS THE DROPPING OR AS WE SAY IN BIOLOGY,
THE


329
0:25:51,249 --> 0:26:0,9
ABSCISSION OF LEAVES. A DROPPING OR THE ABSCISSION
OF


330
0:26:0,9 --> 0:26:4,509
LEAVES. AND MOST OF YOU HAVE NOTICED THAT
IN FALL OR


331
0:26:4,509 --> 0:26:8,389
WINTER THE TREES THAT ARE TYPICALLY GOING
TO LOSE


332
0:26:8,389 --> 0:26:11,659
THEIR LEAVES HAVE BEGUN TO SHED THEIR LEAVES.
HOW IS


333
0:26:11,659 --> 0:26:15,32
IT THAT THE TREE KNOWS THAT WINTER IS COMING
ALONG AND


334
0:26:15,32 --> 0:26:17,659
IT IS TIME TO SHED THE LEAF? WELL, IT COULD
MEASURE


335
0:26:17,659 --> 0:26:19,96
THE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND SAY, IT IS GETTING
COLDER


336
0:26:19,96 --> 0:26:22,84
SO I SHOULD DROP THE LEAF. BUT, YOU KNOW SOMETIMES


337
0:26:22,84 --> 0:26:25,629
THE TEMPERATURE IS NOT COLD. SOMETIMES IT
IS A WARM


338
0:26:25,629 --> 0:26:29,2
FALL OR A WARM WINTER. SO WHAT THE TREE DOES
IN FACT,


339
0:26:29,2 --> 0:26:32,15
IT MEASURES THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT. AND WHEN
THE LIGHT


340
0:26:32,15 --> 0:26:35,23
 GETS TO A CERTAIN LEVEL, THAT CHANGE IS
THE SAME EVERY


341
0:26:35,23 --> 0:26:40,35
YEAR, WHAT THAT DOES IS TRIGGER A DROP IN
AUXIN


342
0:26:40,35 --> 0:26:47,36
PRODUCTION IN THE LEAVES. LESS LIGHT YIELDS
A DROP IN


343
0:26:47,36 --> 0:26:55,249
AUXIN OR IAA PRODUCTION IN THE LEAF. AND THIS
IS


344
0:26:55,249 --> 0:27:2,289
A SIGNAL FOR THE LEAVES TO BEGIN TO TRANSPORT
THE


345
0:27:2,289 --> 0:27:6,149
MATERIALS IN THE FORM OF FOODS TO THE REST
OF THE


346
0:27:6,149 --> 0:27:10,749
PLANT AND A SIGNAL FOR THE LEAF TO BEGIN TO
ABSCISE.


347
0:27:10,749 --> 0:27:14,549
THE FINAL OF THE MANY CHARACTERISTICS THAT
AUXIN IS


348
0:27:14,549 --> 0:27:18,1
INVOLVED WITH THAT I WANT TO GIVE YOU HAS
TO DO WITH


349
0:27:18,1 --> 0:27:29,44
THE ORIENTATION OF PLANTS. IF I TAKE THIS
PLANT HERE


350
0:27:29,44 --> 0:27:33,499
AND I LAY IT ON ITS SIDE YOU KNOW FROM YOUR
EXPERIENCE


351
0:27:33,499 --> 0:27:37,249
THAT EVENTUALLY THE SHOOT IS GOING TO START
GROWING UP


352
0:27:37,249 --> 0:27:40,249
AND IS GOING TO REORIENTATE ITS DIRECTION
WITH REGARD


353
0:27:40,249 --> 0:27:43,869
TO GRAVITY. HOW IS AUXIN INVOLVED IN THIS


354
0:27:43,869 --> 0:27:47,919
REORIENTATION OF THE SHOOT WITH REGARD TO
GRAVITY?


355
0:27:47,919 --> 0:27:50,909
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO THEN IS TO TAKE THIS
STEM,


356
0:27:50,909 --> 0:27:55,749
WHICH IS UPRIGHT NOW, AND NOW ROTATE IT 90
DEGREES.


357
0:27:55,749 --> 0:27:58,179
ROTATE THIS STEM 90 DEGREES WHICH IS WHAT
WE HAVE DONE


358
0:27:58,179 --> 0:28:1,799
 HERE. AND LOOK TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING.
AND, IN


359
0:28:1,799 --> 0:28:5,19
THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION WHEN WE TURN THE
STEM 90


360
0:28:5,19 --> 0:28:12,59
DEGREES, WHAT WE FIND HAPPENING IS THAT AUXIN
MOVES TO


361
0:28:12,59 --> 0:28:18,47
THE LOWER SURFACE.


362
0:28:18,47 --> 0:28:21,96
MOVES TO THE LOWER SURFACE AND


363
0:28:21,96 --> 0:28:35,71
THERE IT STIMULATES GROWTH.


364
0:28:35,71 --> 0:28:39,73
SO, WITH TIME WE GET THIS


365
0:28:39,73 --> 0:28:46,149
SHOOT TO GROW UP, THE SHOOT TO GROW UP. YOU
HAVE MORE


366
0:28:46,149 --> 0:28:50,809
GROWTH HERE, MORE GROWTH ON THE LOWER SURFACE
THAN THE


367
0:28:50,809 --> 0:28:54,309
UPPER SURFACE AND THAT IS DUE TO THE HIGHER


368
0:28:54,309 --> 0:29:1,86
CONCENTRATION OF AUXIN. HOW ABOUT A ROOT?
WHAT


369
0:29:1,86 --> 0:29:4,24
HAPPENS IN THE ROOT IF WE REORIENT THE ROOT
TO THE


370
0:29:4,24 --> 0:29:9,9
HORIZONTAL? IF WE TAKE A ROOT NOW AND WE TAKE
THIS


371
0:29:9,9 --> 0:29:13,19
ROOT AND WE ORIENTATE THE HORIZONTAL, THE
SAME THING


372
0:29:13,19 --> 0:29:16,269
IS GOING TO HAPPEN. AUXIN IS GOING TO MOVE
TO THE


373
0:29:16,269 --> 0:29:20,369
LOWER SURFACE OF THE ROOT. BUT THE ROOT DOESN'T
GROW


374
0:29:20,369 --> 0:29:27,57
UP. THE ROOT GROWS DOWN. SO, WE WAIT FOR SOME
TIME.


375
0:29:27,57 --> 0:29:32,419
WE FIND THAT THE ROOT GROWS DOWN EVEN THOUGH
THERE IS


376
0:29:32,419 --> 0:29:39,44
MORE AUXIN HERE.


377
0:29:39,44 --> 0:29:42,779
THE BACKSIDE HAS MORE GROWTH. IN


378
0:29:42,779 --> 0:29:49,559
THIS PARTICULAR CASE, IN THE ROOT, HIGH AUXIN
INHIBITS


379
0:29:49,559 --> 0:30:0,899
 GROWTH. HIGH AUXIN INHIBITS GROWTH.


380
0:30:0,899 --> 0:30:1,45
SO, THIS BRINGS


381
0:30:1,45 --> 0:30:5,34
UP A QUESTION, I HAVE GIVEN YOU ONLY 5 OR
6 DIFFERENT


382
0:30:5,34 --> 0:30:7,779
THINGS THAT ARE REGULATED BY AUXIN, BUT WE
KNOW THAT


383
0:30:7,779 --> 0:30:9,98
THERE ARE HUNDREDS, PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF
THINGS


384
0:30:9,98 --> 0:30:13,19
REGULATED BY AUXIN IN THE PLANT. HOW IS THE
PLANT


385
0:30:13,19 --> 0:30:16,34
ABLE TO DECIDE WHICH PROCESSES IT WANTS TO
GO AND


386
0:30:16,34 --> 0:30:19,559
WHICH PROCESSES SHOULD NOT BE GOING AT THE
TIME?


387
0:30:19,559 --> 0:30:23,71
THIS PICTURE OVER HERE WILL ILLUSTRATE FOR
YOU ONE OF


388
0:30:23,71 --> 0:30:26,47
THE WAYS IN WHICH THE PLANT DECIDED WHICH
PROCESSES IT


389
0:30:26,47 --> 0:30:28,73
IS GOING TO DO. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO ILLUSTRATE


390
0:30:28,73 --> 0:30:33,21
THAT FOR YOU IN THIS GRAPH OVER HERE. ON THIS
AXIS WE


391
0:30:33,21 --> 0:30:41,509
WILL PUT ELONGATION. ELONGATION. AND ON THE
X AXIS,


392
0:30:41,509 --> 0:30:46,619
WE ARE GOING TO PUT AUXIN CONCENTRATION, WHICH
IS


393
0:30:46,619 --> 0:30:51,999
INCREASING IN THIS DIRECTION. HERE WILL BE


394
0:30:51,999 --> 0:30:57,96
STIMULATION OF ELONGATION. AND HERE WILL BE


395
0:30:57,96 --> 0:31:7,739
INHIBITION. AND HERE WILL BE NO AFFECT. NOW,
LET'S


396
0:31:7,739 --> 0:31:12,95
PUT A ROOT ON THIS CURVE, WHICH HAS DIFFERENT
AUXIN


397
0:31:12,95 --> 0:31:16,29
CONCENTRATIONS. TO PUT THE ROOT ON, WHAT WE
FIND IS


398
0:31:16,29 --> 0:31:18,739
 THAT INITIALLY THERE IS NO AFFECT AT THE
VERY LOW


399
0:31:18,739 --> 0:31:21,45
LEVELS OF AUXIN. AND THEN AS WE BEGIN TO INCREASE
THE


400
0:31:21,45 --> 0:31:26,239
LEVELS OF AUXIN, WE BEGIN TO STIMULATE ELONGATION
IN


401
0:31:26,239 --> 0:31:30,9
THE ROOT AND AS THE CONCENTRATIONS BEGIN TO
BECOME


402
0:31:30,9 --> 0:31:34,519
HIGHER WE BEGIN TO RETURN TO THE NO AFFECT
LINE AND WE


403
0:31:34,519 --> 0:31:39,279
AGAIN TO INHIBIT ELONGATION IN THE ROOT. SO
THIS IS


404
0:31:39,279 --> 0:31:45,769
THE ROOT. HOW ABOUT THE SHOOT NOW. IF WE LOOK
TO SEE


405
0:31:45,769 --> 0:31:47,879
HOW THE SHOOT IS AFFECTED BY INCREASING


406
0:31:47,879 --> 0:31:50,919
CONCENTRATIONS, WHAT WE FIND WITH THE SHOOT
IS AGAIN,


407
0:31:50,919 --> 0:31:55,249
LOW CONCENTRATIONS GIVE NO AFFECT AND NOW
THE


408
0:31:55,249 --> 0:31:58,149
INTERESTING THING IS THAT YOU DON'T BEGIN
TO SEE THE


409
0:31:58,149 --> 0:32:2,759
EFFECT OF THE AUXIN UNTIL YOU GET TO MUCH
HIGHER


410
0:32:2,759 --> 0:32:9,59
CONCENTRATIONS. TO MUCH HIGHER CONCENTRATION.
WHAT


411
0:32:9,59 --> 0:32:12,86
THIS ILLUSTRATES TO YOU IS THAT ONE OF THE
WAYS AUXIN


412
0:32:12,86 --> 0:32:16,809
CAN HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT AFFECTS IN A PLANT
IS THAT


413
0:32:16,809 --> 0:32:20,739
BY CHANGING ITS CONCENTRATION IT CAN HAVE
A DRAMATIC


414
0:32:20,739 --> 0:32:24,9
AFFECT. FOR EXAMPLE, AT THIS CONCENTRATION
OF AUXIN


415
0:32:24,9 --> 0:32:27,57
HERE, WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE, X, WE CAN
STIMULATE


416
0:32:27,57 --> 0:32:32,379
 ROOT ELONGATION. BUT, SHOOTS ARE TOTALLY
BLIND TO


417
0:32:32,379 --> 0:32:35,519
THAT CONCENTRATION. THEY ARE IN NO WAY AFFECTED.
SO


418
0:32:35,519 --> 0:32:39,9
BY CHANGING CONCENTRATIONS OF THIS AUXIN,
YOU CAN


419
0:32:39,9 --> 0:32:43,61
CONTROL DIFFERENT AFFECTS. THIS IS THE BASIS
FOR THE


420
0:32:43,61 --> 0:32:47,929
PRODUCTION OF HERBICIDES. THERE ARE HERBICIDES
WHICH


421
0:32:47,929 --> 0:32:51,7
ARE MADE, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE A LAWN
OF GRASS,


422
0:32:51,7 --> 0:32:54,69
AND YOU WANT TO GET RID OF THE DANDELIONS,
WHICH ARE


423
0:32:54,69 --> 0:32:58,389
EUDICOTS GROWING IN YOUR LAWN OF MONOCOTS,
YOU CAN


424
0:32:58,389 --> 0:33:1,119
SPRAY YOUR LAWN WITH A CONCENTRATION OF AN
HERBICIDE


425
0:33:1,119 --> 0:33:5,71
WHICH IS AN AUXIN ANALOG, LOOKS LIKE AUXIN.
AND THE


426
0:33:5,71 --> 0:33:10,989
DANDELIONS WILL BE KILLED BUT THE GRASS WILL
NOT. AND


427
0:33:10,989 --> 0:33:17,29
YOU CAN SUBSTANCE ON THIS CURVE HERE DANDELION
AND


428
0:33:17,29 --> 0:33:22,6
GRASS. THAT IS, YOU CAN CHOOSE A CONCENTRATION
OF


429
0:33:22,6 --> 0:33:28,249
AUXIN TO WHICH WOULD BE POISONOUS TO THE DANDELION,


430
0:33:28,249 --> 0:33:32,49
BUT HAVE MINIMUM EFFECT ON THE GRASS. SO,
THIS IS THE


431
0:33:32,49 --> 0:33:36,149
BASIS FOR HERBICIDES THAT HAVE SELECTIVITY
AND AUXINS


432
0:33:36,149 --> 0:33:39,9
AND AUXIN ANALOGS ARE ONE OF THE MAIN TYPES
OF


433
0:33:39,9 --> 0:33:41,49
HERBICIDES THAT ARE USED. OKAY, LET ME SHOW
YOU


434
0:33:41,49 --> 0:33:45,239
 A COUPLE OF SLIDES NOW OF SOME OF THESE.
IF I CAN


435
0:33:45,239 --> 0:33:49,2
FIND MY POINTER WHICH I PROBABLY CAN'T. WELL,
NO


436
0:33:49,2 --> 0:33:52,59
POINTER, WE ARE OUT OF LUCK. OKAY. THIS FIRST
ONE IS


437
0:33:52,59 --> 0:33:56,649
A SLIDE OF DARWIN'S HOME, HIS ROOM, WHICH
I HAVE BEEN


438
0:33:56,649 --> 0:34:1,289
TOLD IS EXACTLY THIS WAY IN ENGLAND. IF YOU
GO THERE


439
0:34:1,289 --> 0:34:4,519
NOW THIS IS THE WAY YOU WILL FIND IT. I GOT
IT. HE


440
0:34:4,519 --> 0:34:7,549
DID HIS EXPERIMENTS PRESUMABLY IN THIS ROOM
AND HE


441
0:34:7,549 --> 0:34:10,19
COVERED THE BLINDS, PULLED THE CURTAINS. THIS
IS THE


442
0:34:10,19 --> 0:34:12,429
BOOK THAT HE PUBLISHED WITH FRANCIS. THIS
IS A U.C.


443
0:34:12,429 --> 0:34:15,639
BOOK. AND AS I SAID THERE ARE MANY, SEVERAL
COPIES IN


444
0:34:15,639 --> 0:34:17,809
OUR LIBRARY AND IT IS CERTAINLY WORTHWHILE
HAVING


445
0:34:17,809 --> 0:34:20,45
A LOOK AT IT. THESE ARE THE KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS


446
0:34:20,45 --> 0:34:24,59
DARWIN DID. HE TOOK A CANDLE AND HE COVERED
VARIOUS


447
0:34:24,59 --> 0:34:27,179
PORTIONS OF THE COLEOPTILE. HERE HE PUT A
BLACK PAPER


448
0:34:27,179 --> 0:34:30,75
OVER IT. OR HERE HE PUT A SHEET, WHICH INTERCEPTED


449
0:34:30,75 --> 0:34:33,369
THE LIGHT THAT CAME BELOW THIS LEVEL. WAS
ABLE TO


450
0:34:33,369 --> 0:34:36,359
SHOW THAT IT IS THE TIP OF THE COLEOPTILE
WHICH IS


451
0:34:36,359 --> 0:34:39,149
RESPONDING TO THE LIGHT AND THAT WAS THE PORTION
THAT


452
0:34:39,149 --> 0:34:42,379
 HE LOOKED AT. LATER ON THEN, INDIVIDUAL'S
TOOK


453
0:34:42,379 --> 0:34:46,359
COLEOPTILE TIPS OFF, PUT THEM IN AGAR AND
THIS IS TO


454
0:34:46,359 --> 0:34:49,59
SHOW YOU THE EXPERIMENT. MANY AGAR BLOCKS
WERE


455
0:34:49,59 --> 0:34:52,619
COLLECTED AND THEN THEY WERE SUBSTITUTED FOR
THE


456
0:34:52,619 --> 0:34:56,79
REGULAR COLEOPTILE TIP AND AN ANGLE WAS MEASURED
AND


457
0:34:56,79 --> 0:34:58,69
THAT ANGLE TOLD YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE CONCENTRATION


458
0:34:58,69 --> 0:35:2,309
OF THE HORMONE. THESE ARE THE WAY THE EXPERIMENTS
ARE


459
0:35:2,309 --> 0:35:5,549
RUN. THESE ARE COLEOPTILES. THE AGAR IS PUT
ON THE


460
0:35:5,549 --> 0:35:8,95
BACK, NOT EXACTLY ON THE TOP. THEY USED TO
DO ARMIES


461
0:35:8,95 --> 0:35:12,319
OF THESE COLEOPTILES WHERE YOU WOULD BE ABLE
TO DO


462
0:35:12,319 --> 0:35:14,829
THESE EXPERIMENTS. HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE,
AGAIN, OF


463
0:35:14,829 --> 0:35:17,66
STRONG APICAL DOMINANCE IN WHICH THE PALM
TREE HAS


464
0:35:17,66 --> 0:35:20,859
ONLY ONE MAJOR APEX GROWING OUT. NO AXILLARY
BUDS ARE


465
0:35:20,859 --> 0:35:24,28
GROWING OUT. AS CONTRASTED WITH THIS PLANT
OVER HERE,


466
0:35:24,28 --> 0:35:27,319
WHICH IS IN AFRICA, IN WHICH YOU CAN'T REALLY
PROBABLY


467
0:35:27,319 --> 0:35:29,91
FIND WHAT USED TO BE THE MAIN APEX. THIS HAS
WEAK


468
0:35:29,91 --> 0:35:33,39
APICAL DOMINANCE. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE NOW OF
A


469
0:35:33,39 --> 0:35:36,4
CAMELLIA WHICH HAS BEEN DIPPED IN SYNTHETIC
AUXIN


470
0:35:36,4 --> 0:35:39,51
 WHERE WE STIMULATE ROOTS COMPARED TO A CONTROL,
WHICH


471
0:35:39,51 --> 0:35:43,16
WAS NOT PUT INTO THIS SOLUTION. SHOOT SYSTEM
TURNED


472
0:35:43,16 --> 0:35:46,7
ON ITS SIDE RESULTS IN HIGHER AUXIN CONCENTRATION
ON


473
0:35:46,7 --> 0:35:49,88
THE LOWER SURFACE WHERE WE GET MORE GROWTH
AND THE


474
0:35:49,88 --> 0:35:53,69
SHOOT COMES UPRIGHT. AS CONTRASTED WITH A
ROOT SYSTEM


475
0:35:53,69 --> 0:35:55,44
IN WHICH, IF YOU TAKE THE ROOT, PUT IT HORIZONTALLY,


476
0:35:55,44 --> 0:35:58,26
THE ROOT BENDS DOWN. AGAIN, BECAUSE OF MORE
AUXIN ON


477
0:35:58,26 --> 0:36:0,51
THE LOWER SURFACE. BUT BECAUSE THE LOWER SURFACE


478
0:36:0,51 --> 0:36:3,819
IS INHIBITED RELATIVE TO THE UPPER SURFACE.
THIS


479
0:36:3,819 --> 0:36:7,67
PICTURE TAKEN OUTSIDE BEFORE THE STAIRWAY
WENT IN IN


480
0:36:7,67 --> 0:36:11,54
THE SOUTH, SHOWS A TREE ALONG CAMPANILE WAY
WHICH WAS


481
0:36:11,54 --> 0:36:14,29
NEXT TO A LIGHT. AND WHAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU
IS, AS


482
0:36:14,29 --> 0:36:17,38
FAR AS THIS TREE WAS CONCERNED THE WINTER
AND FALL


483
0:36:17,38 --> 0:36:20,26
REALLY HASN'T COME BECAUSE THE PERIOD OF LIGHT


484
0:36:20,26 --> 0:36:22,88
REMAINED CONSTANT. AND SO, THE LEAVES STAYED
ON THIS


485
0:36:22,88 --> 0:36:26,819
SIDE OF THE TREE. AUXIN CONCENTRATION CONTINUED
WHERE


486
0:36:26,819 --> 0:36:28,73
AS, THE SIDE OF THE TREE AWAY FROM THE LIGHT


487
0:36:28,73 --> 0:36:31,63
EXPERIENCED LESS LIGHT AND AS FAR AS THAT
TREE WAS


488
0:36:31,63 --> 0:36:37,319
 CONCERNED, THE AUXIN WAS NOT, WASN'T THERE
ANY MORE.


489
0:36:37,319 --> 0:36:39,619
OKAY. SO THOSE ARE THE AUXINS, THE FIRST GROUP


490
0:36:39,619 --> 0:36:42,39
HISTORICALLY OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS. NOW,
WHILE


491
0:36:42,39 --> 0:36:46,15
THE WORK WAS GOING ON WITH AUXINS, THE JAPANESE
BEGAN


492
0:36:46,15 --> 0:36:49,869
TO STUDY A DISEASE WHICH WAS CAUSING RICE
PLANTS TO


493
0:36:49,869 --> 0:36:52,76
BECOME VERY, VERY TALL AND SPINDLY. THE DISEASE


494
0:36:52,76 --> 0:36:56,3
CAUSED BY A FUNGUS AND WHEN THE WIND CAME
ALONG THE


495
0:36:56,3 --> 0:36:59,29
RICE PLANTS WERE BLOWN OVER AND THE HEADS
OF RICE WERE


496
0:36:59,29 --> 0:37:2,63
LOST BECAUSE THEY WERE INTO THE WATER. THE
JAPANESE


497
0:37:2,63 --> 0:37:5,69
FROM THIS WORK DISCOVERED THAT THE FINANCING
US WAS


498
0:37:5,69 --> 0:37:8,98
ABLE TO CAUSE THIS ELONGATION, THIS GROWTH
OF THE RICE


499
0:37:8,98 --> 0:37:14,91
STEMS BECAUSE THE FUNGUS PRODUCED A SUBSTANCE
WHICH


500
0:37:14,91 --> 0:37:23,88
THEY LATER IDENTIFIED AS GIBBERELLIC ACID
OR AS IT IS


501
0:37:23,88 --> 0:37:29,99
ABBREVIATED GA. OR GIBBERELLINS AS IT IS SOMETIMES


502
0:37:29,99 --> 0:37:37,27
CALLED. WE NOW KNOW THAT GIBBERELLINS ARE
NATURALLY,


503
0:37:37,27 --> 0:37:39,28
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE FOUND DUE TO A FUNGUS
THEY WERE


504
0:37:39,28 --> 0:37:52,91
ALSO NATURALLY OCCURRING PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS.
THE


505
0:37:52,91 --> 0:37:56,239
JAPANESE WORK WAS NOT WELL KNOWN IN THE UNITED
STATES


506
0:37:56,239 --> 0:38:0,119
 UNTIL THE LATE 40'S, THE EARLY 1950'S PARTLY
BECAUSE


507
0:38:0,119 --> 0:38:3,97
OF LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES, PARTLY BECAUSE OF
THE HIS OF


508
0:38:3,97 --> 0:38:7,5
WORLD WAR II. BUT ONCE THESE OBSERVATIONS
WERE MADE


509
0:38:7,5 --> 0:38:11,64
KNOWN TO BOTH EUROPEANS AND THE AMERICANS,
A LOT OF


510
0:38:11,64 --> 0:38:15,41
WORK THEN WENT IN TO CHARACTERIZING THE GIBBERELLINS


511
0:38:15,41 --> 0:38:18,839
OR GIBBERELLIC ACID. AND THERE ARE PROBABLY
OVER 100


512
0:38:18,839 --> 0:38:21,78
DIFFERENT TYPES OF GIBBERELLINS. AGAIN, A
LOW


513
0:38:21,78 --> 0:38:24,839
MOLECULAR WEIGHT SUBSTANCE WHICH WORKS IN
LOW


514
0:38:24,839 --> 0:38:27,65
CONCENTRATION AND HAS PROFOUND EFFECTS ON
PLANT


515
0:38:27,65 --> 0:38:31,7
DEVELOPMENT. THE FIRST EFFECT THAT I WANT
TO GIVE YOU


516
0:38:31,7 --> 0:38:34,73
WITH REGARD TO GIBBERELLINS IS THAT IT STIMULATES,


517
0:38:34,73 --> 0:38:38,69
WHICH IS THE BASIS OF ITS DISCOVERY, SELF-ELONGATION.


518
0:38:38,69 --> 0:38:47,77
SO THESE ARE CHARACTERISTICS. THESE ARE GIBBERELLIN


519
0:38:47,77 --> 0:38:57,39
CHARACTERISTICS. STIMULATES CELL ELONGATION.
AND,


520
0:38:57,39 --> 0:38:59,799
LET ME SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW WE COMMERCIALLY


521
0:38:59,799 --> 0:39:4,22
USE GIBBERELLINS. THESE ARE GRAPES. MOST OF


522
0:39:4,22 --> 0:39:6,599
YOU BUY GRAPES IN THE STORE AND NEXT TIME


523
0:39:6,599 --> 0:39:9,329
YOU BUY A GRAPE LOOK AT THE GRAPE CAREFULLY
AND LOOK


524
0:39:9,329 --> 0:39:12,92
 TO SEE WHETHER THE GRAPE IS ROUND OR WHETHER
IT IS


525
0:39:12,92 --> 0:39:18,23
ELONGATED AS THESE ARE. IF THE GRAPE IS ELONGATED,


526
0:39:18,23 --> 0:39:20,72
CHANCES ARE THAT THE FARMER OR THE PERSON
WHO WAS


527
0:39:20,72 --> 0:39:24,41
GROWING THESE GRAPES SPRAYED HIS CROP OR HER
CROP WITH


528
0:39:24,41 --> 0:39:27,96
GIBBERELLINS. IN DOING SO, THE CELLS OF THE
GRAPE


529
0:39:27,96 --> 0:39:31,77
ELONGATED, MORE WATER WAS TAKEN INTO THE GRAPE.
THE


530
0:39:31,77 --> 0:39:34,45
NUTRITIONAL CONTENT OF THE GRAPE HASN'T INCREASED.


531
0:39:34,45 --> 0:39:36,5
YOU PAY MORE FOR IT THOUGH, BECAUSE YOU ARE
PAYING FOR


532
0:39:36,5 --> 0:39:40,66
MORE WATER. GIBBERELLINS CAN BE USED. THEY
ARE NOT


533
0:39:40,66 --> 0:39:43,69
CONSIDERED TO BE CHEMICALS BECAUSE THEY ARE
NATURALLY


534
0:39:43,69 --> 0:39:45,52
OCCURRING PLANT GROWTH SUBSTANCES TO WHICH
WE HAVE


535
0:39:45,52 --> 0:39:50,69
BEEN EXPOSED THROUGHOUT OUR ENTIRE EVOLUTION.
A LESS,


536
0:39:50,69 --> 0:39:52,69
ONE THAT MIGHT NOT BOTHER YOU SO MUCH IS FOUND
IN


537
0:39:52,69 --> 0:39:54,95
CAMELLIA FLOWERS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE
FRIENDS


538
0:39:54,95 --> 0:39:57,95
WHO GROW CAMELLIA'S, WHEN CAMELLIA SHOWS ARE
HELD, AND


539
0:39:57,95 --> 0:39:59,66
THEY ARE NOW BEING HELD THIS TIME OF YEAR
IN NORTHERN


540
0:39:59,66 --> 0:40:2,48
CALIFORNIA, PEOPLE LIKE GIANT FLOWERS. AND
ONE OF THE


541
0:40:2,48 --> 0:40:5,59
WAYS THEY DO IT IS BY SPRAYING THE FLOWERS
WITH


542
0:40:5,59 --> 0:40:11,26
 GIBBERELLINS, CALLED GIBBING. AND IT MAKES
THE CELLS


543
0:40:11,26 --> 0:40:14,89
IN THE FLOWER ELONGATE TO GIVE THESE GIANT
ENLARGED


544
0:40:14,89 --> 0:40:20,13
CELLS. SO, THESE ARE SOME EFFECTS THAT YOU
WOULD FIND


545
0:40:20,13 --> 0:40:22,23
FROM GIBBERELLINS. NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO
DO IS


546
0:40:22,23 --> 0:40:25,49
TALK TO YOU ABOUT A FEW OTHER EFFECTS. THE
SECOND


547
0:40:25,49 --> 0:40:30,1
EFFECT IS THAT GIBBERELLINS CONTROL FLOWERING.
AND WE


548
0:40:30,1 --> 0:40:34,93
ARE GOING TO SPEND SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT
HOW THEY


549
0:40:34,93 --> 0:40:38,48
CONTROL FLOWERING AT THE LECTURE WHICH IS
THE SECOND


550
0:40:38,48 --> 0:40:43,66
ONE TO THE LAST. THE THIRD ASPECT, WHICH I
WANTED TO


551
0:40:43,66 --> 0:40:46,4
MENTION TO YOU, WHICH IS REALLY PROBABLY THE
MOST


552
0:40:46,4 --> 0:40:48,9
FASCINATING, BUT CERTAINLY THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD
IS


553
0:40:48,9 --> 0:40:54,839
THAT GIBBERELLINS CONTROL THE PHASE OF LIFE
OF PLANTS.


554
0:40:54,839 --> 0:41:2,24
NOW WHAT DO I MEAN, PHASE OF LIFE THE PLANTS?
I HAVE


555
0:41:2,24 --> 0:41:4,92
A COUPLE EXAMPLES HERE THAT ALL OF YOU ARE
FAMILIAR


556
0:41:4,92 --> 0:41:8,549
WITH. IF YOU GO OUTSIDE AND YOU LOOK IN THE


557
0:41:8,549 --> 0:41:10,97
EUCALYPTUS GROVE YOU LOOK CAREFULLY YOU WILL
SEE THAT


558
0:41:10,97 --> 0:41:14,339
EUCALYPTUS TREE PRODUCES TWO TYPES OF BRANCHES
AND TWO


559
0:41:14,339 --> 0:41:18,67
TYPES OF LEAVES. ON YOUR LEFT HERE, THIS IS
A TYPE IN


560
0:41:18,67 --> 0:41:21,64
 WHICH THERE IS A LEAF. IT IS VERY DIFFERENT
IN SHAPE


561
0:41:21,64 --> 0:41:24,53
FROM THIS TYPE HERE. THESE ARE BOTH ON THE
SAME TREE.


562
0:41:24,53 --> 0:41:27,23
THERE IS NO PETIOLE ON THIS ONE. THE LEAVES
ARE MUCH


563
0:41:27,23 --> 0:41:30,569
WIDER. THESE LEAVES HAVE PETIOLES. THESE LEAVES
ARE


564
0:41:30,569 --> 0:41:34,2
MUCH NARROWER. YOU CAN MAKE ROOTING. YOU CAN
MAKE


565
0:41:34,2 --> 0:41:37,2
CUTTINGS OF THIS PARTICULAR ONE. YOU CAN'T
MAKE


566
0:41:37,2 --> 0:41:39,99
CUTTINGS OF THIS ONE. THIS ONE OVER HERE WILL
PRODUCE


567
0:41:39,99 --> 0:41:43,69
FLOWERS. THIS ONE WILL NOT PRODUCE FLOWERS.


568
0:41:43,69 --> 0:41:46,99
THESE CHARACTERISTICS OF BEING ABLE TO ROOT
IT


569
0:41:46,99 --> 0:41:49,339
AND NOT PRODUCING FLOWERS MAKES THIS A JUVENILE
PHASE.


570
0:41:49,339 --> 0:41:53,869
SO, GIBBERELLINS ARE INVOLVED WITH THE JUVENILE
OR THE


571
0:41:53,869 --> 0:41:56,88
SO-CALLED ADULT PHASE OF EUCALYPTUS. SO LET'S
PUT


572
0:41:56,88 --> 0:42:2,96
THIS DOWN HERE. THE TWO PHASES ARE JUVENILE,
AND THIS


573
0:42:2,96 --> 0:42:6,99
CAPACITY OR ABILITY TO STIMULATE THE PHASE
OF


574
0:42:6,99 --> 0:42:9,74
DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN USED EXPERIMENTALLY.
HERE IS


575
0:42:9,74 --> 0:42:12,41
ANOTHER EXAMPLE, AND I HOPE THAT YOU GUYS
WHEN YOU


576
0:42:12,41 --> 0:42:15,66
LOOK AT IVY WILL LOOK AT THESE PARTS. HERE
IS


577
0:42:15,66 --> 0:42:20,39
JUVENILE IVY. JUVENILE IVY GROWS PROCUMBENT
PARALLEL


578
0:42:20,39 --> 0:42:22,24
 TO THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND. IF YOU BREAK
OFF


579
0:42:22,24 --> 0:42:25,599
A PIECE, IT WILL ROOT. IF YOU TRY TO GET THIS
TO


580
0:42:25,599 --> 0:42:30,849
FLOWER IT WON'T FLOWER. WHEREAS, ADULT IVY,
HAS


581
0:42:30,849 --> 0:42:34,92
A DIFFERENT LEAF SHAPE. IT GROWS UPRIGHT.
IF YOU


582
0:42:34,92 --> 0:42:38,91
BREAK OFF A PIECE IT WON'T ROOT. BUT IT WILL
FLOWER.


583
0:42:38,91 --> 0:42:42,329
IF YOU TAKE THIS ADULT AND YOU SPRAY IT WITH


584
0:42:42,329 --> 0:42:46,59
GIBBERELLIC ACID YOU CAN CONVERT IT BACK TO
THIS


585
0:42:46,59 --> 0:42:48,65
JUVENILE FORM HERE. ONE SUBSTANCE BEING ABLE
TO DO


586
0:42:48,65 --> 0:42:53,579
THAT. PRETTY REMARKABLE. FINALLY, THE LAST
ASPECT I


587
0:42:53,579 --> 0:42:55,68
WANT TO MENTION TO YOU ABOUT GIBBERELLINS
OF THE MANY


588
0:42:55,68 --> 0:42:58,579
AGAIN THAT THEY CONTROL. IS THAT GIBBERELLINS
ARE


589
0:42:58,579 --> 0:43:20,98
INVOLVED IN BREAKING SEED DORMANCY OR IN GERMINATION.


590
0:43:20,98 --> 0:43:24,549
IN CLIMATES LIKE OURS WHERE WE HAVE A -- 
OR EVEN IN


591
0:43:24,549 --> 0:43:27,119
CLIMATES THAT ARE MUCH WORSE THAN OURS, WHERE
WE HAVE


592
0:43:27,119 --> 0:43:29,75
AT A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE CLIMATE OUTSIDE
IS NOT


593
0:43:29,75 --> 0:43:33,2
GOOD FOR SEEDS TO GROW, THEY BECOME DORMANT
AND THEY


594
0:43:33,2 --> 0:43:35,299
HAVE A DORMANCY IMPOSED UPON THEM SO THEY
DON'T


595
0:43:35,299 --> 0:43:38,279
GERMINATE AND DIE UNDER UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS.
BUT


596
0:43:38,279 --> 0:43:41,65
 THAT DORMANCY HAS TO END NATURALLY. AND
THE ENDING OF


597
0:43:41,65 --> 0:43:45,349
THE NATURAL DORMANCY IS INVOLVED OR CONTROLLED
BY


598
0:43:45,349 --> 0:43:48,52
GIBBERELLINS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU
THE STEPS


599
0:43:48,52 --> 0:43:50,94
THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE BREAKING OF DORMANCY
IN


600
0:43:50,94 --> 0:43:54,829
A SEED. SO LET'S MAKE A TYPICAL SEED AND WE
WILL


601
0:43:54,829 --> 0:43:56,859
START OUT WITH A SEED BECAUSE I AM GOING TO
SHOW YOU


602
0:43:56,859 --> 0:44:1,15
SOME PICTURES OF THIS, OF BARLEY. WHICH IS
A MONOCOT.


603
0:44:1,15 --> 0:44:12,89
IT HAS AN EMBRYO. IT HAS GOT THE ENDOSPERM.
AND I AM


604
0:44:12,89 --> 0:44:14,52
GOING TO ADD ONE NEW LAYER ON TO THIS THAT
YOU HAVEN'T


605
0:44:14,52 --> 0:44:20,869
SEEN BEFORE. THAT NEW LAYER IS CALLED, IT
SURROUNDS


606
0:44:20,869 --> 0:44:28,89
THE ENDOSPERM, IT IS CALLED THE ALEURINE LAYER,
THE


607
0:44:28,89 --> 0:44:37,289
ALEURINE LAYER. HOW DOES DORMANCY GET BROKEN?
SO,


608
0:44:37,289 --> 0:44:41,2
THE VERY FIRST THING WHICH HAPPENS IS THAT
THE EMBRYO,


609
0:44:41,2 --> 0:44:43,579
AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS IS, RECEIVES


610
0:44:43,579 --> 0:44:49,299
A SIGNAL.


611
0:44:49,299 --> 0:44:52,24
ONCE IT RECEIVES THIS SIGNAL, THE EMBRYO


612
0:44:52,24 --> 0:45:2,819
EITHER RELEASES OR RELEASES AND MAKES GA.
THE GA MAY


613
0:45:2,819 --> 0:45:9,63
BE THERE OR MAY HAVE TO BE MADE BEFORE IT
IS RELEASED.


614
0:45:9,63 --> 0:45:17,78
THE GA MOVES TO THE ALEURINE LAYER


615
0:45:17,78 --> 0:45:35,95
WHERE IT STIMULATES
 
IN THE ALEURINE THE FORMATION OF AN ENZYME.


616
0:45:35,95 --> 0:45:36,2
THAT


617
0:45:36,2 --> 0:45:43,65
ENZYME IS ALPHA AMYLASE.


618
0:45:43,65 --> 0:45:45,5
AND FINALLY THE ALPHA


619
0:45:45,5 --> 0:46:2,76
AMYLASE CONVERTS THIS STARCH TO SUGAR. AND
THEN THE


620
0:46:2,76 --> 0:46:12,69
SEED GERMINATES. COMMERCIALLY, GIBBERELLINS
ARE OF


621
0:46:12,69 --> 0:46:16,39
EXTREME IMPORTANCE WITH REGARD TO THIS PROCESS.
THIS


622
0:46:16,39 --> 0:46:18,88
ALLOWS US TO GERMINATE SEEDS THAT ARE IN DEEP
DORMANCY


623
0:46:18,88 --> 0:46:22,799
ANY TIME WE WANT. BUT, PROBABLY FOR MANY OF
YOU IN


624
0:46:22,799 --> 0:46:24,89
THE AUDIENCE, I WILL SAY MALE AND I KNOW THIS
IS


625
0:46:24,89 --> 0:46:28,119
SEXIST. MANY OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE, GA'S
HAVE


626
0:46:28,119 --> 0:46:32,309
A SPECIAL FONDNESS BECAUSE GA'S ARE USED TO
TREAT THE


627
0:46:32,309 --> 0:46:37,79
GRAINS OUT OF WHICH BEER IS MADE AND ALE IS
MADE.


628
0:46:37,79 --> 0:46:41,92
GRAIN, WHICH IS TO BE FERMENTED AND TO GIVE
THE BEER


629
0:46:41,92 --> 0:46:47,89
ITS ALCOHOLIC TASTE IS TREATED WITH GA AND
THE GA


630
0:46:47,89 --> 0:46:50,45
CAUSES THE ENDOSPERM TO CONVERT FROM STARCH
TO SUGAR


631
0:46:50,45 --> 0:46:53,789
AND WHEN THIS OCCURS THAT CONVERSION FROM
STARCH TO


632
0:46:53,789 --> 0:46:57,68
SUGAR IS CALLED THE MALT. TO THOSE OF YOU
WHO HAVE


633
0:46:57,68 --> 0:47:2,43
EVER, IN SEEING THAT TERM, THE MALT. ONCE
THE SEEDS


634
0:47:2,43 --> 0:47:5,68
HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH GA, AND THE ENDOSPERM
HAS BEEN


635
0:47:5,68 --> 0:47:9,3
 CONVERTED TO SUGAR THEN THE FERMENTATION
PROCESS


636
0:47:9,3 --> 0:47:14,289
BEGINS. LET ME SHOW YOU A FEW SLIDES NOW OF
GA'S.


637
0:47:14,289 --> 0:47:19,69
THIS FIRST SLIDE WILL SHOW YOU A, POINTER
ALWAYS SEEMS


638
0:47:19,69 --> 0:47:21,51
TO DISAPPEAR BUT THAT IS OKAY. THE FIRST SLIDE
WILL


639
0:47:21,51 --> 0:47:24,67
SHOW YOU A CABBAGE PLANT AND IN THIS PARTICULAR
CASE


640
0:47:24,67 --> 0:47:28,579
THE CABBAGE PLANT WAS SPRAYED WITH GA. AND
IN THIS


641
0:47:28,579 --> 0:47:31,68
CASE NOT ONLY DID CELL ELONGATION OCCUR BUT
WE ALSO


642
0:47:31,68 --> 0:47:35,44
CAUSED THE CABBAGE PLANT TO BEGIN TO FLOWER.
THE NEXT


643
0:47:35,44 --> 0:47:39,109
SLIDE SHOWS THE IVY. ON YOUR LEFT IS THE JUVENILE


644
0:47:39,109 --> 0:47:43,14
IVY, WHERE TYPICAL IVY LEAF AND ON THE RIGHT
IS THE


645
0:47:43,14 --> 0:47:46,849
ADULT IVY WHICH WILL PRODUCE FLOWERS. AND
TO SHOW YOU


646
0:47:46,849 --> 0:47:49,39
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE, HERE IS AN ADULT IVY
PLANT


647
0:47:49,39 --> 0:47:51,91
GROWING UPRIGHT. NOTICE HOW THE LEAVES ARE
VERY


648
0:47:51,91 --> 0:47:54,27
DIFFERENT FROM THE TYPICAL IVY LEAF. AND YOU
ARE


649
0:47:54,27 --> 0:47:57,279
PRODUCING FLOWERS UP AT THE TOP. IF YOU TAKE
THIS


650
0:47:57,279 --> 0:48:1,299
ADULT IVY PLANT NOW HAVING PRODUCED FLOWERS
AND YOU


651
0:48:1,299 --> 0:48:5,23
NOW SPRAY WITH GA, YOU CAN CAUSE THE PLANT
TO RESUME


652
0:48:5,23 --> 0:48:11,309
THE JUVENILE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE IVY INCLUDING
 BECOMING PROCUMBENT AND ALSO BY CHANGING


653
0:48:11,309 --> 0:48:11,559
ITS LEAF


654
0:48:11,559 --> 0:48:14,789
SHAPE. HERE IS SOME GRAPES NOW, JUST TO SHOW
YOU WHAT


655
0:48:14,789 --> 0:48:18,1
HAPPENS. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF GRAPES WHICH
HAVE BEEN


656
0:48:18,1 --> 0:48:20,319
TREATED WITH GA. AND IN THIS EXAMPLE YOU CAN
SEE THE


657
0:48:20,319 --> 0:48:23,619
GRAPES ARE VERY ELONGATED. AND THIS ELONGATION
IS DUE


658
0:48:23,619 --> 0:48:27,609
TO CELLS ELONGATING BUT NOT INCREASING ANY
MORE OF THE


659
0:48:27,609 --> 0:48:31,609
VALUE NUTRITIONALLY OF THE GRAPE. SEED GERMINATION,


660
0:48:31,609 --> 0:48:33,559
THIS IS OF A PINE SEEDLING. A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT


661
0:48:33,559 --> 0:48:35,97
BUT I JUST WANTED TO INDICATE THAT MANY SEEDS
HAVE


662
0:48:35,97 --> 0:48:39,21
DORMANCY. MANY SEEDS PROBABLY INVOLVE A GA
TYPE


663
0:48:39,21 --> 0:48:41,92
MECHANISM. AND THE LAST SLIDE SOME OF YOU
PAY HAVE


664
0:48:41,92 --> 0:48:44,63
ACTUALLY SEEN THIS IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN TO
A BEER


665
0:48:44,63 --> 0:48:48,92
MAKING INSTITUTE. HERE WE HAVE THE BARLEY
SEEDS WHICH


666
0:48:48,92 --> 0:48:51,349
ARE BEING PLACED INTO A LARGE ROOM. THEY HAVE
ALREADY


667
0:48:51,349 --> 0:48:53,75
BEEN CONVERTED TO THE MALT OR THEY ARE GOING
TO BE


668
0:48:53,75 --> 0:48:56,69
SPRAYED WITH THE GA TO BE CONVERTED TO THE
MALT. AND,


669
0:48:56,69 --> 0:48:59,44
IF YOU LOOK IN THESE ROOMS YOU WILL FIND MANY,
MANY OF


670
0:48:59,44 --> 0:49:3,4
THESE SEEDS THEY ARE BEING TREATED WITH GA
AND THEN IN


671
0:49:3,4 --> 0:49:6,5
 THIS SLIDE OVER HERE, THESE ARE THE SEEDS
NOW WHICH


672
0:49:6,5 --> 0:49:10,51
HAVE HAD THE ENDOSPERMS CONVERTED FROM STARCH
TO SUGAR


673
0:49:10,51 --> 0:49:14,22
AND THESE ARE NOW READY TO BE USED IN THE
BREWING OR


674
0:49:14,22 --> 0:49:15,97
THE FERMENTING PORTION OF MAKING BEER.


675
0:49:15,97 --> 0:49:18,69
WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE GROWTH REGULATORS
ON


676
0:49:18,69 --> 0:51:18,69
FRIDAY.
