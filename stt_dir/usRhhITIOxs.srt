0:0:22,529 --> 0:0:30,719
Madame Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members
of Congress, and the First Lady of the United


2
0:0:30,719 --> 0:0:57,899
States:
Iíve come here tonight not only to address


3
0:0:57,899 --> 0:1:4,7
the distinguished men and women in this great
chamber, but to speak frankly and directly


4
0:1:4,7 --> 0:1:10,36
to the men and women who sent us here.
I know that for many Americans watching right


5
0:1:10,36 --> 0:1:18,39
now, the state of our economy is a concern
that rises above all others. And rightly so.


6
0:1:18,39 --> 0:1:22,24
If you havenít been personally affected by
this recession, you probably know someone


7
0:1:22,24 --> 0:1:30,49
who has ñ a friend; a neighbor; a member
of your family. You donít need to hear another


8
0:1:30,49 --> 0:1:36,64
list of statistics to know that our economy
is in crisis, because you live it every day.


9
0:1:36,64 --> 0:1:43,46
Itís the worry you wake up with and the source
of sleepless nights. Itís the job you thought


10
0:1:43,46 --> 0:1:49,2
youíd retire from but now have lost; the
business you built your dreams upon thatís


11
0:1:49,2 --> 0:1:57,67
now hanging by a thread; the college acceptance
letter your child had to put back in the envelope.


12
0:1:57,67 --> 0:2:2,17
The impact of this recession is real, and
it is everywhere.


13
0:2:2,17 --> 0:2:8,84
But while our economy may be weakened and
our confidence shaken; though we are living


14
0:2:8,84 --> 0:2:14,45
through difficult and uncertain times, tonight
I want every American to know this:


15
0:2:14,45 --> 0:2:31,42
We will rebuild, we will recover, and the
United States of America will emerge stronger


16
0:2:31,42 --> 0:2:49,68
than before.
The weight of this crisis will not determine


17
0:2:49,68 --> 0:2:55,81
the destiny of this nation. The answers to
our problems donít lie beyond our reach.


18
0:2:55,81 --> 0:3:3,94
They exist in our laboratories and universities;
in our fields and our factories; in the imaginations


19
0:3:3,94 --> 0:3:10,2
of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the
hardest-working people on Earth. Those qualities


20
0:3:10,2 --> 0:3:14,79
that have made America the greatest force
of progress and prosperity in human history


21
0:3:14,79 --> 0:3:22,93
we still possess in ample measure. What is
required now is for this country to pull together,


22
0:3:22,93 --> 0:3:30,61
confront boldly the challenges we face, and
take responsibility for our future once more.


23
0:3:30,61 --> 0:3:40,37
Now, if weíre honest with ourselves, weíll
admit that for too long, we have not always


24
0:3:40,37 --> 0:3:46,689
met these responsibilities ñ as a government
or as a people. I say this not to lay blame


25
0:3:46,689 --> 0:3:52,189
or look backwards, but because it is only
by understanding how we arrived at this moment


26
0:3:52,189 --> 0:3:55,909
that weíll be able to lift ourselves out
of this predicament.


27
0:3:55,909 --> 0:4:2,51
The fact is, our economy did not fall into
decline overnight. Nor did all of our problems


28
0:4:2,51 --> 0:4:9,239
begin when the housing market collapsed or
the stock market sank. We have known for decades


29
0:4:9,239 --> 0:4:14,969
that our survival depends on finding new sources
of energy. Yet we import more oil today than


30
0:4:14,969 --> 0:4:20,469
ever before. The cost of health care eats
up more and more of our savings each year,


31
0:4:20,469 --> 0:4:25,78
yet we keep delaying reform. Our children
will compete for jobs in a global economy


32
0:4:25,78 --> 0:4:31,15
that too many of our schools do not prepare
them for. And though all these challenges


33
0:4:31,15 --> 0:4:37,86
went unsolved, we still managed to spend more
money and pile up more debt, both as individuals


34
0:4:37,86 --> 0:4:43,61
and through our government, than ever before.
In other words, we have lived through an era


35
0:4:43,61 --> 0:4:49,139
where too often, short-term gains were prized
over long-term prosperity; where we failed


36
0:4:49,139 --> 0:4:54,87
to look beyond the next payment, the next
quarter, or the next election. A surplus became


37
0:4:54,87 --> 0:4:59,21
an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy
instead of an opportunity to invest in our


38
0:4:59,21 --> 0:5:13,15
future. Regulations were gutted for the sake
of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy


39
0:5:13,15 --> 0:5:18,9
market. People bought homes they knew they
couldnít afford from banks and lenders who


40
0:5:18,9 --> 0:5:23,199
pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the
while, critical debates and difficult decisions


41
0:5:23,199 --> 0:5:27,53
were put off for some other time on some other
day.


42
0:5:27,53 --> 0:5:33,389
Well that day of reckoning has arrived, and
the time to take charge of our future is here.


43
0:5:33,389 --> 0:5:39,8
Now is the time to act boldly and wisely ñ
to not only revive this economy, but to build


44
0:5:39,8 --> 0:5:46,0
a new foundation for lasting prosperity. Now
is the time to jumpstart job creation, re-start


45
0:5:46,0 --> 0:5:50,139
lending, and invest in areas like energy,
health care, and education that will grow


46
0:5:50,139 --> 0:5:56,169
our economy, even as we make hard choices
to bring our deficit down. That is what my


47
0:5:56,169 --> 0:6:0,74
economic agenda is designed to do, and thatís
what Iíd like to talk to you about tonight.


48
0:6:0,74 --> 0:6:13,66
Itís an agenda that begins with jobs.
As soon 
as I took office, I asked this Congress to


49
0:6:13,66 --> 0:6:18,16
send me a recovery plan by Presidentís Day
that would put people back to work and put


50
0:6:18,16 --> 0:6:24,229
money in their pockets. Not because I believe
in bigger government ñ I donít. Not because


51
0:6:24,229 --> 0:6:30,55
Iím not mindful of the massive debt weíve
inherited ñ I am. I called for action because


52
0:6:30,55 --> 0:6:36,449
the failure to do so would have cost more
jobs and caused more hardships. In fact, a


53
0:6:36,449 --> 0:6:41,46
failure to act would have worsened our long-term
deficit by assuring weak economic growth for


54
0:6:41,46 --> 0:6:47,599
years. Thatís why I pushed for quick action.
And tonight, I am grateful that this Congress


55
0:6:47,599 --> 0:7:17,789
delivered, and pleased to say that the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act is now law.


56
0:7:17,789 --> 0:7:24,99
Over the next two years, this plan will save
or create 3.5 million jobs. More than 90%


57
0:7:24,99 --> 0:7:29,8
of these jobs will be in the private sector
ñ jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges;


58
0:7:29,8 --> 0:7:36,47
constructing wind turbines and solar panels;
laying broadband and expanding mass transit.


59
0:7:36,47 --> 0:7:41,33
Because of this plan, there are teachers who
can now keep their jobs and educate our kids.


60
0:7:41,33 --> 0:7:47,11
Health care professionals can continue caring
for our sick. There are 57 police officers


61
0:7:47,11 --> 0:7:52,44
who are still on the streets of Minneapolis
tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs


62
0:7:52,44 --> 0:8:5,19
their department was about to make.
Because of this plan, 95% of the working households


63
0:8:5,19 --> 0:8:11,729
in America will receive a tax cut ñ a tax
cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning


64
0:8:11,729 --> 0:8:17,25
on April 1st.
Because of this plan, families who are struggling


65
0:8:17,25 --> 0:8:26,58
to pay tuition costs will receive a $2,500
tax credit for all four years of college.


66
0:8:26,58 --> 0:8:33,81
And Americans who have lost their jobs in
this recession will be able to receive extended


67
0:8:33,81 --> 0:8:44,3
unemployment benefits and continued health
care coverage to help them weather this storm.


68
0:8:44,3 --> 0:8:49,44
I know there are some in this chamber and
watching at home who are skeptical of whether


69
0:8:49,44 --> 0:8:54,77
this plan will work. I understand that skepticism.
Here in Washington, weíve all seen how quickly


70
0:8:54,77 --> 0:9:0,11
good intentions can turn into broken promises
and wasteful spending. And with a plan of


71
0:9:0,11 --> 0:9:3,459
this scale comes enormous responsibility to
get it right.


72
0:9:3,459 --> 0:9:9,799
That is why I have asked Vice President Biden
to lead a tough, unprecedented oversight effort


73
0:9:9,799 --> 0:9:37,66
ñ because nobody messes with Joe. I have
told each member of my Cabinet as well as


74
0:9:37,66 --> 0:9:42,429
mayors and governors across the country that
they will be held accountable by me and the


75
0:9:42,429 --> 0:9:48,97
American people for every dollar they spend.
I have appointed a proven and aggressive Inspector


76
0:9:48,97 --> 0:9:54,64
General to ferret out any and all cases of
waste and fraud. And we have created a new


77
0:9:54,64 --> 0:9:59,5
website called recovery.gov so that every
American can find out how and where their


78
0:9:59,5 --> 0:10:4,449
money is being spent.
So the recovery plan we passed is the first


79
0:10:4,449 --> 0:10:11,41
step in getting our economy back on track.
But it is just the first step. Because even


80
0:10:11,41 --> 0:10:17,39
if we manage this plan flawlessly, there will
be no real recovery unless we clean up the


81
0:10:17,39 --> 0:10:20,91
credit crisis that has severely weakened our
financial system.


82
0:10:20,91 --> 0:10:25,709
I want to speak plainly and candidly about
this issue tonight, because every American


83
0:10:25,709 --> 0:10:31,199
should know that it directly affects you and
your familyís well-being. You should also


84
0:10:31,199 --> 0:10:35,79
know that the money youíve deposited in banks
across the country is safe; your insurance


85
0:10:35,79 --> 0:10:41,15
is secure; and you can rely on the continued
operation of our financial system. That is


86
0:10:41,15 --> 0:10:46,28
not the source of concern.
The concern is that if we do not re-start


87
0:10:46,28 --> 0:10:53,13
lending in this country, our recovery will
be choked off before it even begins.


88
0:10:53,13 --> 0:11:1,98
You see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood
of our economy. The ability to get a loan


89
0:11:1,98 --> 0:11:7,1
is how you finance the purchase of everything
from a home to a car to a college education;


90
0:11:7,1 --> 0:11:12,61
how stores stock their shelves, farms buy
equipment, and businesses make payroll.


91
0:11:12,61 --> 0:11:17,839
But credit has stopped flowing the way it
should. Too many bad loans from the housing


92
0:11:17,839 --> 0:11:23,27
crisis have made their way onto the books
of too many banks. With so much debt and so


93
0:11:23,27 --> 0:11:28,339
little confidence, these banks are now fearful
of lending out any more money to households,


94
0:11:28,339 --> 0:11:33,579
to businesses, or to each other. When there
is no lending, families canít afford to buy


95
0:11:33,579 --> 0:11:40,1
homes or cars. So businesses are forced to
make layoffs. Our economy suffers even more,


96
0:11:40,1 --> 0:11:45,12
and credit dries up even further.
That is why this administration is moving


97
0:11:45,12 --> 0:11:51,839
swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive
cycle, restore confidence, and re-start lending.


98
0:11:51,839 --> 0:11:57,699
We will do so in several ways. First, we are
creating a new lending fund that represents


99
0:11:57,699 --> 0:12:3,679
the largest effort ever to help provide auto
loans, college loans, and small business loans


100
0:12:3,679 --> 0:12:17,959
to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep
this economy running.


101
0:12:17,959 --> 0:12:33,0
Second, we have launched a housing plan that
will help responsible families facing the


102
0:12:33,0 --> 0:12:37,74
threat of foreclosure lower their monthly
payments and re-finance their mortgages. Itís


103
0:12:37,74 --> 0:12:41,949
a plan that wonít help speculators or that
neighbor down the street who bought a house


104
0:12:41,949 --> 0:12:47,459
he could never hope to afford, but it will
help millions of Americans who are struggling


105
0:12:47,459 --> 0:12:52,36
with declining home values ñ Americans who
will now be able to take advantage of the


106
0:12:52,36 --> 0:12:56,9
lower interest rates that this plan has already
helped bring about. In fact, the average family


107
0:12:56,9 --> 0:13:7,91
who re-finances today can save nearly $2000
per year on their mortgage.


108
0:13:7,91 --> 0:13:14,459
Third, we will act with the full force of
the federal government to ensure that the


109
0:13:14,459 --> 0:13:19,35
major banks that Americans depend on have
enough confidence and enough money to lend


110
0:13:19,35 --> 0:13:24,949
even in more difficult times. And when we
learn that a major bank has serious problems,


111
0:13:24,949 --> 0:13:30,559
we will hold accountable those responsible,
force the necessary adjustments, provide the


112
0:13:30,559 --> 0:13:36,679
support to clean up their balance sheets,
and assure the continuity of a strong, viable


113
0:13:36,679 --> 0:13:40,35
institution that can serve our people and
our economy.


114
0:13:40,35 --> 0:13:44,429
I understand that on any given day, Wall Street
may be more comforted by an approach that


115
0:13:44,429 --> 0:13:50,79
gives banks bailouts with no strings attached,
and that holds nobody accountable for their


116
0:13:50,79 --> 0:13:55,699
reckless decisions. But such an approach wonít
solve the problem. And our goal is to quicken


117
0:13:55,699 --> 0:14:0,51
the day when we re-start lending to the American
people and American business and end this


118
0:14:0,51 --> 0:14:5,52
crisis once and for all.
I intend to hold these banks fully accountable


119
0:14:5,52 --> 0:14:9,919
for the assistance they receive, and this
time, they will have to clearly demonstrate


120
0:14:9,919 --> 0:14:35,829
how taxpayer dollars result in more lending
for the American taxpayer. This time, CEOs


121
0:14:35,829 --> 0:14:40,91
wonít be able to use taxpayer money to pad
their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear


122
0:14:40,91 --> 0:15:2,699
on a private jet. Those days are over.
Still, this plan will require significant


123
0:15:2,699 --> 0:15:8,179
resources from the federal government ñ and
yes, probably more than weíve already set


124
0:15:8,179 --> 0:15:14,549
aside. But while the cost of action will be
great, I can assure you that the cost of inaction


125
0:15:14,549 --> 0:15:19,85
will be far greater, for it could result in
an economy that sputters along for not months


126
0:15:19,85 --> 0:15:26,189
or years, but perhaps a decade. That would
be worse for our deficit, worse for business,


127
0:15:26,189 --> 0:15:46,799
worse for you, and worse for the next generation.
And I refuse to let that happen.


128
0:15:46,799 --> 0:15:50,72
I understand that when the last administration
asked this Congress to provide assistance


129
0:15:50,72 --> 0:15:56,2
for struggling banks, Democrats and Republicans
alike were infuriated by the mismanagement


130
0:15:56,2 --> 0:16:1,97
and results that followed. So were the American
taxpayers. So was I.


131
0:16:1,97 --> 0:16:7,539
So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as
helping banks right now, especially when everyone


132
0:16:7,539 --> 0:16:12,89
is suffering in part from their bad decisions.
I promise you ñ I get it.


133
0:16:12,89 --> 0:16:17,939
But I also know that in a time of crisis,
we cannot afford to govern out of anger, or


134
0:16:17,939 --> 0:16:26,73
yield to the politics of the moment. My job
ñ our job ñ is to solve the problem. Our


135
0:16:26,73 --> 0:16:33,919
job is to govern with a sense of responsibility.
I will not spend a single penny for the purpose


136
0:16:33,919 --> 0:16:38,679
of rewarding a single Wall Street executive,
but I will do whatever it takes to help the


137
0:16:38,679 --> 0:16:43,76
small business that canít pay its workers
or the family that has saved and still canít


138
0:16:43,76 --> 0:17:5,319
get a mortgage.
Thatís what this is about. Itís not about


139
0:17:5,319 --> 0:17:10,699
helping banks ñ itís about helping people.
Because when credit is available again, that


140
0:17:10,699 --> 0:17:15,66
young family can finally buy a new home. And
then some company will hire workers to build


141
0:17:15,66 --> 0:17:20,39
it. And then those workers will have money
to spend, and if they can get a loan too,


142
0:17:20,39 --> 0:17:25,199
maybe theyíll finally buy that car, or open
their own business. Investors will return


143
0:17:25,199 --> 0:17:32,6
to the market, and American families will
see their retirement secured once more. Slowly,


144
0:17:32,6 --> 0:17:45,7
but surely, confidence will return, and our
economy will recover.


145
0:17:45,7 --> 0:17:50,47
So I ask this Congress to join me in doing
whatever proves necessary. Because we cannot


146
0:17:50,47 --> 0:17:56,15
consign our nation to an open-ended recession.
And to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude


147
0:17:56,15 --> 0:18:1,83
never happens again, I ask Congress to move
quickly on legislation that will finally reform


148
0:18:1,83 --> 0:18:24,29
our outdated regulatory system. It is time
to put in place tough, new common-sense rules


149
0:18:24,29 --> 0:18:30,32
of the road so that our financial market rewards
drive and innovation, and punishes short-cuts


150
0:18:30,32 --> 0:18:34,48
and abuse.
The recovery plan and the financial stability


151
0:18:34,48 --> 0:18:40,36
plan are the immediate steps weíre taking
to revive our economy in the short-term. But


152
0:18:40,36 --> 0:18:45,85
the only way to fully restore Americaís economic
strength is to make the long-term investments


153
0:18:45,85 --> 0:18:50,32
that will lead to new jobs, new industries,
and a renewed ability to compete with the


154
0:18:50,32 --> 0:18:55,31
rest of the world. The only way this century
will be another American century is if we


155
0:18:55,31 --> 0:19:0,8
confront at last the price of our dependence
on oil and the high cost of health care; the


156
0:19:0,8 --> 0:19:5,62
schools that arenít preparing our children
and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit.


157
0:19:5,62 --> 0:19:10,51
That is our responsibility.
In the next few days, I will submit a budget


158
0:19:10,51 --> 0:19:16,77
to Congress. So often, we have come to view
these documents as simply numbers on a page


159
0:19:16,77 --> 0:19:22,52
or laundry lists of programs. I see this document
differently. I see it as a vision for America


160
0:19:22,52 --> 0:19:28,47
ñ as a blueprint for our future.
My budget does not attempt to solve every


161
0:19:28,47 --> 0:19:33,54
problem or address every issue. It reflects
the stark reality of what weíve inherited


162
0:19:33,54 --> 0:19:39,45
ñ a trillion dollar deficit, a financial
crisis, and a costly recession.


163
0:19:39,45 --> 0:19:44,78
Given these realities, everyone in this chamber
ñ Democrats and Republicans ñ will have


164
0:19:44,78 --> 0:19:52,44
to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which
there are no dollars. And that includes me.


165
0:19:52,44 --> 0:19:58,6
But that does not mean we can afford to ignore
our long-term challenges. I reject the view


166
0:19:58,6 --> 0:20:2,44
that says our problems will simply take care
of themselves; that says government has no


167
0:20:2,44 --> 0:20:6,97
role in laying the foundation for our common
prosperity.


168
0:20:6,97 --> 0:20:12,28
For history tells a different story. History
reminds us that at every moment of economic


169
0:20:12,28 --> 0:20:18,9
upheaval and transformation, this nation has
responded with bold action and big ideas.


170
0:20:18,9 --> 0:20:23,68
In the midst of civil war, we laid railroad
tracks from one coast to another that spurred


171
0:20:23,68 --> 0:20:28,48
commerce and industry. From the turmoil of
the Industrial Revolution came a system of


172
0:20:28,48 --> 0:20:35,38
public high schools that prepared our citizens
for a new age. In the wake of war and depression,


173
0:20:35,38 --> 0:20:46,91
the GI Bill sent a generation to college and
created the largest middle-class in history.


174
0:20:46,91 --> 0:21:2,15
And a twilight struggle for freedom led to
a nation of highways, an American on the moon,


175
0:21:2,15 --> 0:21:6,78
and an explosion of technology that still
shapes our world.


176
0:21:6,78 --> 0:21:13,6
In each case, government didnít supplant
private enterprise; it catalyzed private enterprise.


177
0:21:13,6 --> 0:21:17,9
It created the conditions for thousands of
entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt


178
0:21:17,9 --> 0:21:22,27
and to thrive.
We are a nation that has seen promise amid


179
0:21:22,27 --> 0:21:29,42
peril, and claimed opportunity from ordeal.
Now we must be that nation again. That is


180
0:21:29,42 --> 0:21:35,24
why, even as it cuts back on the programs
we donít need, the budget I submit will invest


181
0:21:35,24 --> 0:21:41,73
in the three areas that are absolutely critical
to our economic future: energy, health care,


182
0:21:41,73 --> 0:22:2,47
and education.
It begins with energy.


183
0:22:2,47 --> 0:22:8,23
We know the country that harnesses the power
of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st


184
0:22:8,23 --> 0:22:13,74
century. And yet, it is China that has launched
the largest effort in history to make their


185
0:22:13,74 --> 0:22:20,11
economy energy efficient. We invented solar
technology, but weíve fallen behind countries


186
0:22:20,11 --> 0:22:26,7
like Germany and Japan in producing it. New
plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines,


187
0:22:26,7 --> 0:22:32,95
but they will run on batteries made in Korea.
Well I do not accept a future where the jobs


188
0:22:32,95 --> 0:22:37,7
and industries of tomorrow take root beyond
our borders ñ and I know you donít either.


189
0:22:37,7 --> 0:23:2,88
It is time for America to lead again.
Thanks to our recovery plan, we will double


190
0:23:2,88 --> 0:23:7,82
this nationís supply of renewable energy
in the next three years. We have also made


191
0:23:7,82 --> 0:23:13,17
the largest investment in basic research funding
in American history ñ an investment that


192
0:23:13,17 --> 0:23:18,29
will spur not only new discoveries in energy,
but breakthroughs in medicine, science, and


193
0:23:18,29 --> 0:23:21,74
technology.
We will soon lay down thousands of miles of


194
0:23:21,74 --> 0:23:26,83
power lines that can carry new energy to cities
and towns across this country. And we will


195
0:23:26,83 --> 0:23:31,25
put Americans to work making our homes and
buildings more efficient so that we can save


196
0:23:31,25 --> 0:23:37,37
billions of dollars on our energy bills.
But to truly transform our economy, protect


197
0:23:37,37 --> 0:23:42,93
our security, and save our planet from the
ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately


198
0:23:42,93 --> 0:23:48,64
make clean, renewable energy the profitable
kind of energy. So I ask this Congress to


199
0:23:48,64 --> 0:23:54,7
send me legislation that places a market-based
cap on carbon pollution and drives the production


200
0:23:54,7 --> 0:24:15,8
of more renewable energy in America. And to
support that innovation, we will invest fifteen


201
0:24:15,8 --> 0:24:20,6
billion dollars a year to develop technologies
like wind power and solar power; advanced


202
0:24:20,6 --> 0:24:29,0
biofuels, clean coal, and more fuel-efficient
cars and trucks built right here in America.


203
0:24:29,0 --> 0:24:40,8
As for our auto industry, everyone recognizes
that years of bad decision-making and a global


204
0:24:40,8 --> 0:24:46,59
recession have pushed our automakers to the
brink. We should not, and will not, protect


205
0:24:46,59 --> 0:24:51,75
them from their own bad practices. But we
are committed to the goal of a re-tooled,


206
0:24:51,75 --> 0:24:57,44
re-imagined auto industry that can compete
and win. Millions of jobs depend on it. Scores


207
0:24:57,44 --> 0:25:3,7
of communities depend on it. And I believe
the nation that invented the automobile cannot


208
0:25:3,7 --> 0:25:23,47
walk away from it.
None of this will come without cost, nor will


209
0:25:23,47 --> 0:25:29,67
it be easy. But this is America. We donít
do whatís easy. We do what is necessary to


210
0:25:29,67 --> 0:25:34,63
move this country forward.
For that same reason, we must also address


211
0:25:34,63 --> 0:25:39,67
the crushing cost of health care.
This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy


212
0:25:39,67 --> 0:25:46,1
in America every thirty seconds. By the end
of the year, it could cause 1.5 million Americans


213
0:25:46,1 --> 0:25:52,57
to lose their homes. In the last eight years,
premiums have grown four times faster than


214
0:25:52,57 --> 0:25:57,15
wages. And in each of these years, one million
more Americans have lost their health insurance.


215
0:25:57,15 --> 0:26:2,71
It is one of the major reasons why small businesses
close their doors and corporations ship jobs


216
0:26:2,71 --> 0:26:8,98
overseas. And itís one of the largest and
fastest-growing parts of our budget.


217
0:26:8,98 --> 0:26:22,44
Given these facts, we can no longer afford
to put health care reform on hold.


218
0:26:22,44 --> 0:26:35,22
Already, we have done more to advance the
cause of health care reform in the last thirty


219
0:26:35,22 --> 0:26:41,32
days than we have in the last decade. When
it was days old, this Congress passed a law


220
0:26:41,32 --> 0:26:47,3
to provide and protect health insurance for
eleven million American children whose parents


221
0:26:47,3 --> 0:27:6,63
work full-time. Our recovery plan will invest
in electronic health records and new technology


222
0:27:6,63 --> 0:27:12,65
that will reduce errors, bring down costs,
ensure privacy, and save lives. It will launch


223
0:27:12,65 --> 0:27:18,89
a new effort to conquer a disease that has
touched the life of nearly every American


224
0:27:18,89 --> 0:27:39,77
by seeking a cure for cancer in our time.
And it makes the largest investment ever in


225
0:27:39,77 --> 0:27:44,85
preventive care, because that is one of the
best ways to keep our people healthy and our


226
0:27:44,85 --> 0:27:49,82
costs under control.
This budget builds on these reforms. It includes


227
0:27:49,82 --> 0:27:55,179
an historic commitment to comprehensive health
care reform ñ a down-payment on the principle


228
0:27:55,179 --> 0:28:5,61
that we must have quality, affordable health
care for every American. Itís a commitment


229
0:28:5,61 --> 0:28:10,6
thatís paid for in part by efficiencies in
our system that are long overdue. And itís


230
0:28:10,6 --> 0:28:15,33
a step we must take if we hope to bring down
our deficit in the years to come.


231
0:28:15,33 --> 0:28:20,3
Now, there will be many different opinions
and ideas about how to achieve reform, and


232
0:28:20,3 --> 0:28:25,309
that is why Iím bringing together businesses
and workers, doctors and health care providers,


233
0:28:25,309 --> 0:28:30,17
Democrats and Republicans to begin work on
this issue next week.


234
0:28:30,17 --> 0:28:35,97
I suffer no illusions that this will be an
easy process. It will be hard. But I also


235
0:28:35,97 --> 0:28:41,55
know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt
first called for reform, the cost of our health


236
0:28:41,55 --> 0:28:47,11
care has weighed down our economy and the
conscience of our nation long enough. So let


237
0:28:47,11 --> 0:28:53,35
there be no doubt: health care reform cannot
wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait


238
0:28:53,35 --> 0:29:16,8
another year.
The third challenge we must address is the


239
0:29:16,8 --> 0:29:20,13
urgent need to expand the promise of education
in America.


240
0:29:20,13 --> 0:29:26,15
In a global economy where the most valuable
skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good


241
0:29:26,15 --> 0:29:31,16
education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity
ñ it is a pre-requisite.


242
0:29:31,16 --> 0:29:36,89
Right now, three-quarters of the fastest-growing
occupations require more than a high school


243
0:29:36,89 --> 0:29:42,82
diploma. And yet, just over half of our citizens
have that level of education. We have one


244
0:29:42,82 --> 0:29:48,16
of the highest high school dropout rates of
any industrialized nation. And half of the


245
0:29:48,16 --> 0:29:54,49
students who begin college never finish.
This is a prescription for economic decline,


246
0:29:54,49 --> 0:29:59,34
because we know the countries that out-teach
us today will out-compete us tomorrow. That


247
0:29:59,34 --> 0:30:5,9
is why it will be the goal of this administration
to ensure that every child has access to a


248
0:30:5,9 --> 0:30:9,84
complete and competitive education ñ from
the day they are born to the day they begin


249
0:30:9,84 --> 0:30:28,8
a career.
Already, we have made an historic investment


250
0:30:28,8 --> 0:30:33,44
in education through the economic recovery
plan. We have dramatically expanded early


251
0:30:33,44 --> 0:30:38,34
childhood education and will continue to improve
its quality, because we know that the most


252
0:30:38,34 --> 0:30:43,96
formative learning comes in those first years
of life. We have made college affordable for


253
0:30:43,96 --> 0:30:52,92
nearly seven million more students. And we
have provided the resources necessary to prevent


254
0:30:52,92 --> 0:30:57,83
painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would
set back our childrenís progress.


255
0:30:57,83 --> 0:31:4,64
But we know that our schools donít just need
more resources. They need more reform. That


256
0:31:4,64 --> 0:31:14,27
is why this budget creates new incentives
for teacher performance; pathways for advancement,


257
0:31:14,27 --> 0:31:22,89
and rewards for success. Weíll invest in
innovative programs that are already helping


258
0:31:22,89 --> 0:31:28,61
schools meet high standards and close achievement
gaps. And we will expand our commitment to


259
0:31:28,61 --> 0:31:38,72
charter schools.
It is our responsibility as lawmakers and


260
0:31:38,72 --> 0:31:43,38
educators to make this system work. But it
is the responsibility of every citizen to


261
0:31:43,38 --> 0:31:49,2
participate in it. And so tonight, I ask every
American to commit to at least one year or


262
0:31:49,2 --> 0:31:54,49
more of higher education or career training.
This can be community college or a four-year


263
0:31:54,49 --> 0:32:1,16
school; vocational training or an apprenticeship.
But whatever the training may be, every American


264
0:32:1,16 --> 0:32:5,99
will need to get more than a high school diploma.
And dropping out of high school is no longer


265
0:32:5,99 --> 0:32:10,67
an option. Itís not just quitting on yourself,
itís quitting on your country ñ and this


266
0:32:10,67 --> 0:32:38,49
country needs and values the talents of every
American. That is why we will provide the


267
0:32:38,49 --> 0:32:45,44
support necessary for you to complete college
and meet a new goal: by 2020, America will


268
0:32:45,44 --> 0:33:3,809
once again have the highest proportion of
college graduates in the world.


269
0:33:3,809 --> 0:33:8,83
I know that the price of tuition is higher
than ever, which is why if you are willing


270
0:33:8,83 --> 0:33:15,51
to volunteer in your neighborhood or give
back to your community or serve your country,


271
0:33:15,51 --> 0:33:25,59
we will make sure that you can afford a higher
education. And to encourage a renewed spirit


272
0:33:25,59 --> 0:33:32,19
of national service for this and future generations,
I ask this Congress to send me the bipartisan


273
0:33:32,19 --> 0:33:37,14
legislation that bears the name of Senator
Orrin Hatch as well as an American who has


274
0:33:37,14 --> 0:34:3,73
never stopped asking what he can do for his
country ñ Senator Edward Kennedy.


275
0:34:3,73 --> 0:34:9,49
These education policies will open the doors
of opportunity for our children. But it is


276
0:34:9,49 --> 0:34:15,859
up to us to ensure they walk through them.
In the end, there is no program or policy


277
0:34:15,859 --> 0:34:23,859
that can substitute for a mother or father
who will attend those parent/teacher conferences,


278
0:34:23,859 --> 0:34:28,549
or help with homework after dinner, or turn
off the TV, put away the video games, and


279
0:34:28,549 --> 0:34:35,55
read to their child. I speak to you not just
as a President, but as a father when I say


280
0:34:35,55 --> 0:34:59,67
that responsibility for our children's education
must begin at home.


281
0:34:59,67 --> 0:35:5,1
There is, of course, another responsibility
we have to our children. And that is the responsibility


282
0:35:5,1 --> 0:35:31,54
to ensure that we do not pass on to them a
debt they cannot pay. With the deficit we


283
0:35:31,54 --> 0:35:47,41
inherited, the 


284
0:35:47,41 --> 0:35:54,46
cost of the crisis we face, and the long-term
challenges we must meet, it has never been


285
0:35:54,46 --> 0:35:59,77
more important to ensure that as our economy
recovers, we do what it takes to bring this


286
0:35:59,77 --> 0:36:9,82
deficit down.
Iím proud that we passed the recovery plan


287
0:36:9,82 --> 0:36:16,64
free of earmarks, and I want to pass a budget
next year that ensures that each dollar we


288
0:36:16,64 --> 0:36:22,28
spend reflects only our most important national
priorities.


289
0:36:22,28 --> 0:36:27,46
Yesterday, I held a fiscal summit where I
pledged to cut the deficit in half by the


290
0:36:27,46 --> 0:36:32,73
end of my first term in office. My administration
has also begun to go line by line through


291
0:36:32,73 --> 0:36:38,609
the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful
and ineffective programs. As you can imagine,


292
0:36:38,609 --> 0:36:41,0
this is a process that will take some time.
But weíre starting with the biggest lines.


293
0:36:41,0 --> 0:36:47,5
We have already identified two trillion dollars
in savings over the next decade.


294
0:36:47,5 --> 0:36:59,52
In this budget, we will end education programs
that donít work and end direct payments to


295
0:36:59,52 --> 0:37:12,1
large agribusinesses that donít need them.
Weíll eliminate the no-bid contracts that


296
0:37:12,1 --> 0:37:32,82
have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our
defense budget so that weíre not paying for


297
0:37:32,82 --> 0:37:42,13
Cold War-era weapons systems we donít use.
We will root out the waste, fraud, and abuse


298
0:37:42,13 --> 0:37:46,55
in our Medicare program that doesnít make
our seniors any healthier, and we will restore


299
0:37:46,55 --> 0:37:52,9
a sense of fairness and balance to our tax
code by finally ending the tax breaks for


300
0:37:52,9 --> 0:38:12,32
corporations that ship our jobs overseas.
In order to save our children from a future


301
0:38:12,32 --> 0:38:21,1
of debt, we will also end the tax breaks for
the wealthiest 2% of Americans. But let me


302
0:38:21,1 --> 0:38:27,4
perfectly clear, because I know youíll hear
the same old claims that rolling back these


303
0:38:27,4 --> 0:38:32,83
tax breaks means a massive tax increase on
the American people: if your family earns


304
0:38:32,83 --> 0:38:46,109
less than $250,000 a year, you will not see
your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat:


305
0:38:46,109 --> 0:39:6,55
not one single dime. In fact, the recovery
plan provides a tax cut ñ thatís right,


306
0:39:6,55 --> 0:39:24,91
a tax cut ñ for 95% of working families.
And these checks are on the way.


307
0:39:24,91 --> 0:39:31,57
To preserve our long-term fiscal health, we
must also address the growing costs in Medicare


308
0:39:31,57 --> 0:39:37,359
and Social Security. Comprehensive health
care reform is the best way to strengthen


309
0:39:37,359 --> 0:39:42,359
Medicare for years to come. And we must also
begin a conversation on how to do the same


310
0:39:42,359 --> 0:39:50,23
for Social Security, while creating tax-free
universal savings accounts for all Americans.


311
0:39:50,23 --> 0:39:57,6
Finally, because weíre also suffering from
a deficit of trust, I am committed to restoring


312
0:39:57,6 --> 0:40:2,9
a sense of honesty and accountability to our
budget. That is why this budget looks ahead


313
0:40:2,9 --> 0:40:8,42
ten years and accounts for spending that was
left out under the old rules ñ and for the


314
0:40:8,42 --> 0:40:17,32
first time, that includes the full cost of
fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. For seven


315
0:40:17,32 --> 0:40:33,73
years, we have been a nation at war. No longer
will we hide its price.


316
0:40:33,73 --> 0:40:39,4
We are now carefully reviewing our policies
in both wars, and I will soon announce a way


317
0:40:39,4 --> 0:41:0,6
forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people
and responsibly ends this war.


318
0:41:0,6 --> 0:41:5,18
And with our friends and allies, we will forge
a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan


319
0:41:5,18 --> 0:41:12,99
and Pakistan to defeat al Qaeda and combat
extremism. Because I will not allow terrorists


320
0:41:12,99 --> 0:41:33,29
to plot against the American people from safe
havens half a world away.


321
0:41:33,29 --> 0:41:38,96
As we meet here tonight, our men and women
in uniform stand watch abroad and more are


322
0:41:38,96 --> 0:41:44,67
readying to deploy. To each and every one
of them, and to the families who bear the


323
0:41:44,67 --> 0:41:51,28
quiet burden of their absence, Americans are
united in sending one message: we honor your


324
0:41:51,28 --> 0:42:48,9
service, we are inspired by your sacrifice,
and you have our unyielding support. To relieve


325
0:42:48,9 --> 0:42:54,21
the strain on our forces, my budget increases
the number of our soldiers and Marines. And


326
0:42:54,21 --> 0:43:0,34
to keep our sacred trust with those who serve,
we will raise their pay, and give our veterans


327
0:43:0,34 --> 0:43:11,98
the expanded health care and benefits that
they have earned.


328
0:43:11,98 --> 0:43:26,49
To overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant
in upholding the values our troops defend


329
0:43:26,49 --> 0:43:32,13
ñ because there is no force in the world
more powerful than the example of America.


330
0:43:32,13 --> 0:43:36,25
That is why I have ordered the closing of
the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, and


331
0:43:36,25 --> 0:43:45,52
will seek swift and certain justice for captured
terrorists ñ because living our values doesnít


332
0:43:45,52 --> 0:43:53,9
make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes
us stronger. And that is why I can stand here


333
0:43:53,9 --> 0:44:0,73
tonight and say without exception or equivocation
that the United States of America does not


334
0:44:0,73 --> 0:44:26,54
torture.
In words and deeds, we are showing the world


335
0:44:26,54 --> 0:44:31,859
that a new era of engagement has begun. For
we know that America cannot meet the threats


336
0:44:31,859 --> 0:44:37,73
of this century alone, but the world cannot
meet them without America. We cannot shun


337
0:44:37,73 --> 0:44:44,75
the negotiating table, nor ignore the foes
or forces that could do us harm. We are instead


338
0:44:44,75 --> 0:44:50,44
called to move forward with the sense of confidence
and candor that serious times demand.


339
0:44:50,44 --> 0:44:55,59
To seek progress toward a secure and lasting
peace between Israel and her neighbors, we


340
0:44:55,59 --> 0:45:1,39
have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort.
To meet the challenges of the 21st century


341
0:45:1,39 --> 0:45:6,609
ñ from terrorism to nuclear proliferation;
from pandemic disease to cyber threats to


342
0:45:6,609 --> 0:45:12,57
crushing poverty ñ we will strengthen old
alliances, forge new ones, and use all elements


343
0:45:12,57 --> 0:45:16,72
of our national power.
And to respond to an economic crisis that


344
0:45:16,72 --> 0:45:21,369
is global in scope, we are working with the
nations of the G-20 to restore confidence


345
0:45:21,369 --> 0:45:27,26
in our financial system, avoid the possibility
of escalating protectionism, and spur demand


346
0:45:27,26 --> 0:45:32,88
for American goods in markets across the globe.
For the world depends on us to have a strong


347
0:45:32,88 --> 0:45:37,48
economy, just as our economy depends on the
strength of the worldís.


348
0:45:37,48 --> 0:45:44,69
As we stand at this crossroads of history,
the eyes of all people in all nations are


349
0:45:44,69 --> 0:45:50,619
once again upon us ñ watching to see what
we do with this moment; waiting for us to


350
0:45:50,619 --> 0:45:53,95
lead.
Those of us gathered here tonight have been


351
0:45:53,95 --> 0:46:0,81
called to govern in extraordinary times. It
is a tremendous burden, but also a great privilege


352
0:46:0,81 --> 0:46:7,56
ñ one that has been entrusted to few generations
of Americans. For in our hands lies the ability


353
0:46:7,56 --> 0:46:14,369
to shape our world for good or for ill.
I know that it is easy to lose sight of this


354
0:46:14,369 --> 0:46:19,24
truth ñ to become cynical and doubtful; consumed
with the petty and the trivial.


355
0:46:19,24 --> 0:46:25,72
But in my life, I have also learned that hope
is found in unlikely places; that inspiration


356
0:46:25,72 --> 0:46:31,22
often comes not from those with the most power
or celebrity, but from the dreams and aspirations


357
0:46:31,22 --> 0:46:40,64
of Americans who are anything but ordinary.
I think about Leonard Abess, the bank president


358
0:46:40,64 --> 0:46:48,9
from Miami who reportedly cashed out of his
company, took a $60 million bonus, and gave


359
0:46:48,9 --> 0:46:57,99
it out to all 399 people who worked for him,
plus another 72 who used to work for him.


360
0:46:57,99 --> 0:47:2,64
He didnít tell anyone, but when the local
newspaper found out, he simply said, ''I knew


361
0:47:2,64 --> 0:47:45,57
some of these people since I was 7 years old.
I didn't feel right getting the money myself."


362
0:47:45,57 --> 0:47:53,26
I think about Greensburg, Kansas, a town that
was completely destroyed by a tornado, but


363
0:47:53,26 --> 0:47:59,24
is being rebuilt by its residents as a global
example of how clean energy can power an entire


364
0:47:59,24 --> 0:48:4,94
community ñ how it can bring jobs and businesses
to a place where piles of bricks and rubble


365
0:48:4,94 --> 0:48:10,56
once lay. "The tragedy was terrible," said
one of the men who helped them rebuild. "But


366
0:48:10,56 --> 0:48:14,21
the folks here know that it also provided
an incredible opportunity."


367
0:48:14,21 --> 0:48:22,5
And I think about TyíSheoma Bethea, the young
girl from that school I visited in Dillon,


368
0:48:22,5 --> 0:48:28,95
South Carolina ñ a place where the ceilings
leak, the paint peels off the walls, and they


369
0:48:28,95 --> 0:48:34,29
have to stop teaching six times a day because
the train barrels by their classroom. She


370
0:48:34,29 --> 0:48:40,22
has been told that her school is hopeless,
but the other day after class she went to


371
0:48:40,22 --> 0:48:47,4
the public library and typed up a letter to
the people sitting in this room. She even


372
0:48:47,4 --> 0:48:55,38
asked her principal for the money to buy a
stamp. The letter asks us for help, and says,


373
0:48:55,38 --> 0:49:0,93
"We are just students trying to become lawyers,
doctors, congressmen like yourself and one


374
0:49:0,93 --> 0:49:7,619
day president, so we can make a change to
not just the state of South Carolina but also


375
0:49:7,619 --> 0:49:53,45
the world. We are not quitters."
We are not quitters.


376
0:49:53,45 --> 0:49:58,48
These words and these stories tell us something
about the spirit of the people who sent us


377
0:49:58,48 --> 0:50:4,95
here. They tell us that even in the most trying
times, amid the most difficult circumstances,


378
0:50:4,95 --> 0:50:13,53
there is a generosity, a resilience, a decency,
and a determination that perseveres; a willingness


379
0:50:13,53 --> 0:50:18,68
to take responsibility for our future and
for posterity.


380
0:50:18,68 --> 0:50:25,21
Their resolve must be our inspiration. Their
concerns must be our cause. And we must show


381
0:50:25,21 --> 0:50:36,13
them and all our people that we are equal
to the task before us.


382
0:50:36,13 --> 0:50:44,869
I know that we havenít agreed on every issue
thus far, and there are surely times in the


383
0:50:44,869 --> 0:50:51,3
future when we will part ways. But I also
know that every American who is sitting here


384
0:50:51,3 --> 0:51:16,32
tonight loves this country and wants it to
succeed. That 


385
0:51:16,32 --> 0:51:21,22
must be the starting point for every debate
we have in the coming months, and where we


386
0:51:21,22 --> 0:51:28,21
return after those debates are done. That
is the foundation on which the American people


387
0:51:28,21 --> 0:51:33,599
expect us to build common ground.
And if we do ñ if we come together and lift


388
0:51:33,599 --> 0:51:39,2
this nation from the depths of this crisis;
if we put our people back to work and restart


389
0:51:39,2 --> 0:51:44,98
the engine of our prosperity; if we confront
without fear the challenges of our time and


390
0:51:44,98 --> 0:51:51,31
summon that enduring spirit of an America
that does not quit, then someday years from


391
0:51:51,31 --> 0:51:56,64
now our children can tell their children that
this was the time when we performed, in the


392
0:51:56,64 --> 0:52:2,95
words that are carved into this very chamber,
"something worthy to be remembered." Thank


393
0:52:2,95 --> 0:54:2,95
you, God Bless you, and may God Bless the
United States of America.
