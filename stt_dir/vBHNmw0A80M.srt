LELE SAVERI: At the beginning
of 2008, world news outlets


5
0:2:51,1 --> 0:2:53,66
were flooded with images
of garbage piles in


6
0:2:53,66 --> 0:2:55,67
the streets of Naples.


7
0:2:55,67 --> 0:2:59,17
The newly reelected premier,
Silvio Berlusconi, made


8
0:2:59,17 --> 0:3:2,66
countless TV appearances,
personally picking up trash


9
0:3:2,66 --> 0:3:5,52
and promising to resolve
the situation.


10
0:3:5,52 --> 0:3:8,11
Naples and the entire Campania
region had been officially


11
0:3:8,11 --> 0:3:11,78
declared an environmental crisis
over 14 years ago.


12
0:3:11,78 --> 0:3:14,4
The garbage piles were just a
current distraction from the


13
0:3:14,4 --> 0:3:16,6

14
0:3:16,6 --> 0:3:18,48
almost 8 million tons of rubbish
stockpiled throughout

dumps, a serious human


16
0:3:22,59 --> 0:3:23,68

17
0:3:23,68 --> 0:3:26,27
And behind it all, the largest
criminal organization in


18

Italy, the Neapolitan Camorra.

about to meet Michele Buonomo,

who's the president of
Legambiente Campania.

a mountain with just rubbish,


29
0:6:56,23 --> 0:6:58,56
without doing anything to them,
not burning or nothing.

But we're not allowed to go
through the main square of

Naples, because Cavalieri
Berlusconi made the head of

from that building to that
