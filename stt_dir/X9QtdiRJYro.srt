0:0:1,54 --> 0:0:4,56
WIL WHEATON: When most people
think of a small world, they


3
0:0:4,56 --> 0:0:7,825
think of being on a boat
surrounded by creepy dolls who


4
0:0:7,825 --> 0:0:9,402
won't stop singing.


5
0:0:9,402 --> 0:0:13,91
But when gamers think of a Small
World, they imagine a


6
0:0:13,91 --> 0:0:17,76
fantasy-filled land full of
crazy races with outrageous


7
0:0:17,76 --> 0:0:21,59
powers, where the world is
covered in blood as we battle


8
0:0:21,59 --> 0:0:25,31
to see who can take it over
and win the game.


9
0:0:25,31 --> 0:0:29,385
Today on TableTop, Grant
Imahara, Sean Plott, and Jenna


10
0:0:29,385 --> 0:0:36,904
Busch are here as we visit my
very favorite Small World.


11
0:0:36,904 --> 0:0:53,96
[MUSIC PLAYING]


12
0:0:53,96 --> 0:0:56,34
WIL WHEATON: Small World
combines the military strategy


13
0:0:56,34 --> 0:0:59,79
of Risk with the delightful
art and fantasy races of


14
0:0:59,79 --> 0:1:1,4
Cosmic Encounter.


15
0:1:1,4 --> 0:1:4,209
Whoever has the most points
at the end of nine


16
0:1:4,209 --> 0:1:6,38
rounds wins the game.


17
0:1:6,38 --> 0:1:11,53
We earn points by conquering
and holding territories.


18
0:1:11,53 --> 0:1:15,68
Empty territories cost
two units to conquer.


19
0:1:15,68 --> 0:1:19,21
Every item in a territory
costs one


20
0:1:19,21 --> 0:1:21,27
more unit to conquer.


21
0:1:21,27 --> 0:1:26,1
For example, one defender,
that's three units.


22
0:1:26,1 --> 0:1:29,53
One mountain, that's
also three units.


23
0:1:29,53 --> 0:1:34,35
A mountain plus a defender,
that's four units.


24
0:1:34,35 --> 0:1:37,98
At the beginning of every game,
each player will choose


25
0:1:37,98 --> 0:1:42,59
a fantasy race, like orcs,
elves, or the dwarves.


26
0:1:42,59 --> 0:1:46,11
Each race is combined with a
unique special power, like


27
0:1:46,11 --> 0:1:48,84
seafaring, flying, or heroic.


28
0:1:48,84 --> 0:1:51,56
These power and race
combinations change every


29
0:1:51,56 --> 0:1:55,52
game, giving Small World
tremendous replay value.


30
0:1:55,52 --> 0:1:59,86
No empire lasts forever, so
don't get too attached to your


31
0:1:59,86 --> 0:2:1,63
diplomatic skeletons.


32
0:2:1,63 --> 0:2:4,68
You will inevitably run out
of units to conquer new


33
0:2:4,68 --> 0:2:5,38
territories.


34
0:2:5,38 --> 0:2:6,62
But don't worry.


35
0:2:6,62 --> 0:2:9,84
When that happens, you simply
put your active race into


36
0:2:9,84 --> 0:2:14,71
decline and choose a new one
from the board and begin


37
0:2:14,71 --> 0:2:17,19
conquering all over again.


38
0:2:17,19 --> 0:2:21,19
It's a very small world, and
only one person can be the


39
0:2:21,19 --> 0:2:24,71
victor atop the bloody,
stinking heap of his


40
0:2:24,71 --> 0:2:26,12
vanquished opponents.


41
0:2:26,12 --> 0:2:28,71
Who will that be tonight?


42
0:2:28,71 --> 0:2:31,17
We will soon find out,
because it is time


43
0:2:31,17 --> 0:2:32,42
to play Small World.


44
0:2:32,42 --> 0:2:36,53



45
0:2:36,53 --> 0:2:38,65
GRANT IMAHARA: My name is Grant
Imahara, and I'm one of


46
0:2:38,65 --> 0:2:41,46
the hosts on Discovery Channel's
MythBusters, where


47
0:2:41,46 --> 0:2:45,28
we basically blow things up
in the name of science.


48
0:2:45,28 --> 0:2:48,21
JENNA BUSCH: I'm Jenna Busch,
and I am an online blogger.


49
0:2:48,21 --> 0:2:49,43
I do on-camera interviews.


50
0:2:49,43 --> 0:2:51,85
I interview celebrities and
cover comic books, video


51
0:2:51,85 --> 0:2:53,39
games, TV, and film.


52
0:2:53,39 --> 0:2:54,89
SEAN PLOTT: My real name
is Sean Plott.


53
0:2:54,89 --> 0:2:58,31
But on the internets I'm
known as Day[9].


54
0:2:58,31 --> 0:3:1,14
I'm mainly known because I do
StarCraft II commentary.


55
0:3:1,14 --> 0:3:1,72
JENNA BUSCH: Yes.


56
0:3:1,72 --> 0:3:2,72
WIL WHEATON: You get
to go first.


57
0:3:2,72 --> 0:3:4,185
JENNA BUSCH: Nice.


58
0:3:4,185 --> 0:3:5,18
All right.


59
0:3:5,18 --> 0:3:6,62
I wanted to be a sorcerer
because I


60
0:3:6,62 --> 0:3:9,8
usually play magic users.


61
0:3:9,8 --> 0:3:11,43
It's just a thing that I've
been doing since I started


62
0:3:11,43 --> 0:3:12,17
playing D&D.


63
0:3:12,17 --> 0:3:12,47
WIL WHEATON: OK.


64
0:3:12,47 --> 0:3:13,74
You want the hill sorcerers,
so you pay


65
0:3:13,74 --> 0:3:15,4
one tax to the halflings.


66
0:3:15,4 --> 0:3:15,79
SEAN PLOTT: What?


67
0:3:15,79 --> 0:3:16,5
JENNA BUSCH: Yeah.


68
0:3:16,5 --> 0:3:17,63
WIL WHEATON: Then you take
the hill sorcerers.


69
0:3:17,63 --> 0:3:17,97
Go ahead.


70
0:3:17,97 --> 0:3:18,38
Grab them.


71
0:3:18,38 --> 0:3:19,58
Those are for you.


72
0:3:19,58 --> 0:3:20,59
SEAN PLOTT: God, I'm already
on [INAUDIBLE].


73
0:3:20,59 --> 0:3:22,773
I wanted the hill sorcerers
so bad.


74
0:3:22,773 --> 0:3:24,174
WIL WHEATON: You're
going to get the--


75
0:3:24,174 --> 0:3:37,4



76
0:3:37,4 --> 0:3:39,53
So you choose a section of the
board that is on the edge of


77
0:3:39,53 --> 0:3:40,68
the board to come in.


78
0:3:40,68 --> 0:3:41,792
JENNA BUSCH: All right.


79
0:3:41,792 --> 0:3:42,46
I'm starting here.


80
0:3:42,46 --> 0:3:43,22
WIL WHEATON: Coming in
on the mountains.


81
0:3:43,22 --> 0:3:43,65
JENNA BUSCH: Uh-huh.


82
0:3:43,65 --> 0:3:45,12
WIL WHEATON: So that'll
be three, right?


83
0:3:45,12 --> 0:3:45,485
JENNA BUSCH: Mm-hm.


84
0:3:45,485 --> 0:3:46,11
WIL WHEATON: You put
in one too many.


85
0:3:46,11 --> 0:3:46,5
JENNA BUSCH: Oh, I did.


86
0:3:46,5 --> 0:3:47,7
WIL WHEATON: There you go.


87
0:3:47,7 --> 0:3:48,15
There's three guys.


88
0:3:48,15 --> 0:3:48,36
JENNA BUSCH: All right.


89
0:3:48,36 --> 0:3:48,98
WIL WHEATON: OK?


90
0:3:48,98 --> 0:3:50,981
JENNA BUSCH: Hmm.


91
0:3:50,981 --> 0:3:51,39
There.


92
0:3:51,39 --> 0:3:52,472
Well, no.


93
0:3:52,472 --> 0:3:53,14
WIL WHEATON: All right.


94
0:3:53,14 --> 0:3:54,265
So that's another three.


95
0:3:54,265 --> 0:3:55,9
JENNA BUSCH: Three.


96
0:3:55,9 --> 0:3:55,42
WIL WHEATON: All right.


97
0:3:55,42 --> 0:3:56,63
And you killed the lost tribes.


98
0:3:56,63 --> 0:3:57,54
Oh, no.


99
0:3:57,54 --> 0:3:58,75
I love living in the forest.


100
0:3:58,75 --> 0:3:59,105
JENNA BUSCH: I'm murdery.


101
0:3:59,105 --> 0:4:0,355
GRANT IMAHARA: They
were lost, anyway.


102
0:4:0,355 --> 0:4:13,74



103
0:4:13,74 --> 0:4:13,94
WIL WHEATON: I know.


104
0:4:13,94 --> 0:4:14,14
JENNA BUSCH: Yeah.


105
0:4:14,14 --> 0:4:15,3
WIL WHEATON: You're
very murdery.


106
0:4:15,3 --> 0:4:15,71
JENNA BUSCH: Yeah.


107
0:4:15,71 --> 0:4:16,74
Very murdery.


108
0:4:16,74 --> 0:4:18,47
And then three there.


109
0:4:18,47 --> 0:4:19,29
Hills.


110
0:4:19,29 --> 0:4:20,486
WIL WHEATON: And three there
to claim that hill.


111
0:4:20,486 --> 0:4:22,205
All right, so and we'll
score you up at


112
0:4:22,205 --> 0:4:22,92
the end of your turn.


113
0:4:22,92 --> 0:4:25,32
One, two, three points.


114
0:4:25,32 --> 0:4:25,52
SEAN PLOTT: All right.


115
0:4:25,52 --> 0:4:27,79
Straight up have my
heart set on the


116
0:4:27,79 --> 0:4:30,316
wonderful alchemist giant.


117
0:4:30,316 --> 0:4:45,7



118
0:4:45,7 --> 0:4:45,84
I'm going to start
looping around.


119
0:4:45,84 --> 0:4:45,93
WIL WHEATON: All right.


120
0:4:45,93 --> 0:4:46,715
SEAN PLOTT: This is my order.


121
0:4:46,715 --> 0:4:47,39
All right.


122
0:4:47,39 --> 0:4:49,355
I'm going to eliminate these
guys momentarily.


123
0:4:49,355 --> 0:4:50,2
WIL WHEATON: That's two.


124
0:4:50,2 --> 0:4:51,86
SEAN PLOTT: And this is where
the gambling comes.


125
0:4:51,86 --> 0:4:52,11
WIL WHEATON: OK.


126
0:4:52,11 --> 0:4:52,81
SEAN PLOTT: Oh, wait.


127
0:4:52,81 --> 0:4:53,39
If I--


128
0:4:53,39 --> 0:4:53,845
WIL WHEATON: You still
don't have to gamble.


129
0:4:53,845 --> 0:4:54,9
You're good.


130
0:4:54,9 --> 0:4:55,71
That's two.


131
0:4:55,71 --> 0:4:56,7
SEAN PLOTT: And then--


132
0:4:56,7 --> 0:4:56,6
WIL WHEATON: That's one.


133
0:4:56,6 --> 0:4:57,82
SEAN PLOTT: --this is where
the gamble comes in.


134
0:4:57,82 --> 0:4:58,94
WIL WHEATON: And here's your
reinforcement die.


135
0:4:58,94 --> 0:5:1,42
SEAN PLOTT: I need-- oh, god,
I need this so bad.


136
0:5:1,42 --> 0:5:2,373
WIL WHEATON: When Sean's talking
about gambling, what


137
0:5:2,373 --> 0:5:4,82
he means is on your very last
move, you can roll this


138
0:5:4,82 --> 0:5:6,22
reinforcement die.


139
0:5:6,22 --> 0:5:9,33
It has three blank faces and
the numbers one to three on


140
0:5:9,33 --> 0:5:10,84
the remaining three faces.


141
0:5:10,84 --> 0:5:12,98
And that tells you how
many mysterious


142
0:5:12,98 --> 0:5:14,54
reinforcement guys you get.


143
0:5:14,54 --> 0:5:16,94
So since he's trying to conquer
that mountain, that


144
0:5:16,94 --> 0:5:18,25
space is going to
cost him three.


145
0:5:18,25 --> 0:5:19,15
He only has two guys.


146
0:5:19,15 --> 0:5:22,58
So if he rolls that die and gets
a one, two, or three, he


147
0:5:22,58 --> 0:5:23,16
conquers the mountain.


148
0:5:23,16 --> 0:5:24,53
So basically you have
a 50% chance of


149
0:5:24,53 --> 0:5:25,6
conquering the mountain.


150
0:5:25,6 --> 0:5:27,28
Conquer that mountain!


151
0:5:27,28 --> 0:5:28,9
GRANT IMAHARA: Feeling lucky?


152
0:5:28,9 --> 0:5:29,47
SEAN PLOTT: Now, the thing is I
just want to say, I could go


153
0:5:29,47 --> 0:5:30,88
here, but that doesn't
let me [BEEP]


154
0:5:30,88 --> 0:5:32,31
gamble, which is the
important thing.


155
0:5:32,31 --> 0:5:32,665
WIL WHEATON: I know.


156
0:5:32,665 --> 0:5:33,2
I understand.


157
0:5:33,2 --> 0:5:33,665
SEAN PLOTT: All right.


158
0:5:33,665 --> 0:5:34,99
WIL WHEATON: Kids,
gambling is cool.


159
0:5:34,99 --> 0:5:36,27
Also, so is smoking.


160
0:5:36,27 --> 0:5:36,51
All right.


161
0:5:36,51 --> 0:5:38,89
Go ahead and roll your die
and see what happens.


162
0:5:38,89 --> 0:5:39,983
SEAN PLOTT: Oh!


163
0:5:39,983 --> 0:5:41,27
GRANT IMAHARA: Denied.


164
0:5:41,27 --> 0:5:43,48
SEAN PLOTT: Notice how little
dots there are.


165
0:5:43,48 --> 0:5:44,9
GRANT IMAHARA: Yeah,
that's terrible.


166
0:5:44,9 --> 0:5:44,64
SEAN PLOTT: It looks
[INAUDIBLE]


167
0:5:44,64 --> 0:5:44,99
WIL WHEATON: OK.


168
0:5:44,99 --> 0:5:47,21
So go ahead and take
that giant back.


169
0:5:47,21 --> 0:5:49,19
That lost tribesmen actually
defends you.


170
0:5:49,19 --> 0:5:50,88
Off my land, giants.


171
0:5:50,88 --> 0:5:51,87
SEAN PLOTT: And now
I redeploy.


172
0:5:51,87 --> 0:5:53,245
WIL WHEATON: And now you
go ahead and redeploy.


173
0:5:53,245 --> 0:6:2,9



174
0:6:2,9 --> 0:6:4,96
So go ahead and count up
your points there.


175
0:6:4,96 --> 0:6:8,5
SEAN PLOTT: One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.


176
0:6:8,5 --> 0:6:8,7
GRANT IMAHARA: Eight.


177
0:6:8,7 --> 0:6:9,78
SEAN PLOTT: From
the alchemists.


178
0:6:9,78 --> 0:6:10,41
WIL WHEATON: Dude,
the alchemists.


179
0:6:10,41 --> 0:6:10,8
All right.


180
0:6:10,8 --> 0:6:11,34
GRANT IMAHARA: Excellent.


181
0:6:11,34 --> 0:6:11,19
Good turn.


182
0:6:11,19 --> 0:6:11,502
WIL WHEATON: All right.


183
0:6:11,502 --> 0:6:11,88
Here you go.


184
0:6:11,88 --> 0:6:13,44
So there's two 3s--


185
0:6:13,44 --> 0:6:13,87
SEAN PLOTT: [INAUDIBLE].


186
0:6:13,87 --> 0:6:16,45
WIL WHEATON: --for six
and two ones for two.


187
0:6:16,45 --> 0:6:17,38
GRANT IMAHARA: Oh my god.


188
0:6:17,38 --> 0:6:18,19
WIL WHEATON: There you are.


189
0:6:18,19 --> 0:6:18,665
Congratulations.


190
0:6:18,665 --> 0:6:19,51
SEAN PLOTT: I'm now
accumulating--


191
0:6:19,51 --> 0:6:21,3
WIL WHEATON: And now, Grant,
it is your turn.


192
0:6:21,3 --> 0:6:23,995
Let's see who you're
going to be.


193
0:6:23,995 --> 0:6:26,41
You now can choose
the pillaging--


194
0:6:26,41 --> 0:6:27,93
Oh my god, the pillaging orcs!


195
0:6:27,93 --> 0:6:28,95
You don't want the
pillaging orcs.


196
0:6:28,95 --> 0:6:30,37
They're terrible.


197
0:6:30,37 --> 0:6:31,287
Terrible.


198
0:6:31,287 --> 0:6:44,9



199
0:6:44,9 --> 0:6:47,54
GRANT IMAHARA: Because I know
that Wil wants it so bad--


200
0:6:47,54 --> 0:6:47,92
WIL WHEATON: Really?


201
0:6:47,92 --> 0:6:49,24
GRANT IMAHARA: --I might
have to take it


202
0:6:49,24 --> 0:6:51,16
just to deny you that.


203
0:6:51,16 --> 0:6:52,3
WIL WHEATON: It's going to
be that kind of game.


204
0:6:52,3 --> 0:6:53,44
All right.


205
0:6:53,44 --> 0:6:55,38
Listen, Imahara, if that's the
kind of game you want to play,


206
0:6:55,38 --> 0:6:56,61
I will play that kind of game.


207
0:6:56,61 --> 0:6:58,34
Oh, I will play that
kind of game.


208
0:6:58,34 --> 0:6:58,42
GRANT IMAHARA: You're
good to go?


209
0:6:58,42 --> 0:6:59,14
You're good to go?


210
0:6:59,14 --> 0:6:59,59
WIL WHEATON: Bring it.


211
0:6:59,59 --> 0:7:0,31
GRANT IMAHARA: All right.


212
0:7:0,31 --> 0:7:1,0
Let's do it.


213
0:7:1,0 --> 0:7:1,42
OK.


214
0:7:1,42 --> 0:7:3,83
SEAN PLOTT: So if you want to
just start here, that's very


215
0:7:3,83 --> 0:7:5,18
not here, then that's great.


216
0:7:5,18 --> 0:7:5,78
GRANT IMAHARA: I know.


217
0:7:5,78 --> 0:7:7,66
You know, that's looking really
attractive to me.


218
0:7:7,66 --> 0:7:9,17
I think I'm actually going
to go here because


219
0:7:9,17 --> 0:7:10,97
you're doubled up.


220
0:7:10,97 --> 0:7:11,345
SEAN PLOTT: Yeah.


221
0:7:11,345 --> 0:7:11,72
Yeah.


222
0:7:11,72 --> 0:7:12,53
GRANT IMAHARA: All right.


223
0:7:12,53 --> 0:7:13,74
For this turn.


224
0:7:13,74 --> 0:7:14,82
So I'll take this.


225
0:7:14,82 --> 0:7:16,1
WIL WHEATON: So you're
coming in there.


226
0:7:16,1 --> 0:7:16,73
GRANT IMAHARA: Plus one.


227
0:7:16,73 --> 0:7:17,203
WIL WHEATON: Uh-huh.


228
0:7:17,203 --> 0:7:17,676
Good.


229
0:7:17,676 --> 0:7:18,622
I regret nothing!


230
0:7:18,622 --> 0:7:20,39
GRANT IMAHARA: Bye.


231
0:7:20,39 --> 0:7:22,29
I'll take two here.


232
0:7:22,29 --> 0:7:23,68
WIL WHEATON: Tell my
wife I love her!


233
0:7:23,68 --> 0:7:24,95
GRANT IMAHARA: Plus one.


234
0:7:24,95 --> 0:7:26,54
Come to me, bonuses.


235
0:7:26,54 --> 0:7:27,79
Fly to me.


236
0:7:27,79 --> 0:7:30,1



237
0:7:30,1 --> 0:7:31,2
Two to here.


238
0:7:31,2 --> 0:7:32,22
WIL WHEATON: I can't believe
I wasted time


239
0:7:32,22 --> 0:7:33,285
watching Drive Angry 3D.


240
0:7:33,285 --> 0:7:36,75
[LAUGHTER]


241
0:7:36,75 --> 0:7:40,14
GRANT IMAHARA: Every time I
conquer someone, I get one


242
0:7:40,14 --> 0:7:44,0
coin for the territory, one coin
because I'm an orc, and


243
0:7:44,0 --> 0:7:46,62
another one because
I'm pillaging.


244
0:7:46,62 --> 0:7:46,89
WIL WHEATON: Nice.


245
0:7:46,89 --> 0:7:47,76
GRANT IMAHARA: Bang.


246
0:7:47,76 --> 0:7:49,61
WIL WHEATON: Congratulations,
Grant.


247
0:7:49,61 --> 0:7:50,58
Well done.


248
0:7:50,58 --> 0:7:52,77
GRANT IMAHARA: I'm raking
it in right now.


249
0:7:52,77 --> 0:7:54,29
WIL WHEATON: Those of you at
home who play this game are


250
0:7:54,29 --> 0:7:56,5
going, why in the world
do you have Pandemic


251
0:7:56,5 --> 0:7:57,89
guys in this game?


252
0:7:57,89 --> 0:8:0,13
Well, because we have
a camera crew.


253
0:8:0,13 --> 0:8:2,74
So that you can enjoy this, we
want people to know where


254
0:8:2,74 --> 0:8:4,27
things are happening
on the board.


255
0:8:4,27 --> 0:8:4,53
OK.


256
0:8:4,53 --> 0:8:6,87
So I think I'm going
to actually go


257
0:8:6,87 --> 0:8:9,14
for the wealthy dwarves.


258
0:8:9,14 --> 0:8:9,58
GRANT IMAHARA: Really?


259
0:8:9,58 --> 0:8:10,7
SEAN PLOTT: Really?


260
0:8:10,7 --> 0:8:11,32
On turn one?


261
0:8:11,32 --> 0:8:25,5



262
0:8:25,5 --> 0:8:27,24
WIL WHEATON: I'm going
to come in here.


263
0:8:27,24 --> 0:8:29,74
That's three, two for the space,
one for the mountain.


264
0:8:29,74 --> 0:8:30,66
GRANT IMAHARA: And
you get a mine.


265
0:8:30,66 --> 0:8:33,94
WIL WHEATON: So I started with
wealthy dwarves because I get


266
0:8:33,94 --> 0:8:35,98
seven coins just for
having them.


267
0:8:35,98 --> 0:8:38,98
But I knew that I would have
very little difficulty


268
0:8:38,98 --> 0:8:41,59
grabbing and holding
a couple of mines.


269
0:8:41,59 --> 0:8:43,419
And I can just leave those
dwarves there, and they're


270
0:8:43,419 --> 0:8:44,92
paying me two coins a turn.


271
0:8:44,92 --> 0:8:46,79
I'm going to go ahead and
score and redeploy.


272
0:8:46,79 --> 0:8:50,16
I get two because there's
a mine there.


273
0:8:50,16 --> 0:8:52,38
I get, oh, three.


274
0:8:52,38 --> 0:8:54,23
I get four, five.


275
0:8:54,23 --> 0:8:56,39
I also get seven because
I'm wealthy.


276
0:8:56,39 --> 0:8:57,37
So I get 12 this turn.


277
0:8:57,37 --> 0:8:59,23
But the most important
thing is--


278
0:8:59,23 --> 0:8:59,31
JENNA BUSCH: The voice.


279
0:8:59,31 --> 0:9:1,98
WIL WHEATON: Oh, but Gimli
was my favorite.


280
0:9:1,98 --> 0:9:2,42
OK.


281
0:9:2,42 --> 0:9:3,763
So they go away.


282
0:9:3,763 --> 0:9:4,69
JENNA BUSCH: Who was
waiting for that?


283
0:9:4,69 --> 0:9:7,34
WIL WHEATON: And now
a little redeploy.


284
0:9:7,34 --> 0:9:8,38
[INAUDIBLE]


285
0:9:8,38 --> 0:9:8,78
there.


286
0:9:8,78 --> 0:9:9,47
All right.


287
0:9:9,47 --> 0:9:10,54
So what did I say?


288
0:9:10,54 --> 0:9:11,23
Did I say 12?


289
0:9:11,23 --> 0:9:12,35
I said 12, didn't I?


290
0:9:12,35 --> 0:9:13,42
SEAN PLOTT: That is such
a thinly-veiled brag.


291
0:9:13,42 --> 0:9:14,9
WIL WHEATON: Math.


292
0:9:14,9 --> 0:9:15,13
SEAN PLOTT: Can I just
double check that I


293
0:9:15,13 --> 0:9:16,315
got a 12-point turn?


294
0:9:16,315 --> 0:9:18,81
Can you guys hold up as many
fingers as I have points?


295
0:9:18,81 --> 0:9:21,41
It might take two of you.


296
0:9:21,41 --> 0:9:23,91
GRANT IMAHARA: Wil really
knows this game well.


297
0:9:23,91 --> 0:9:26,64
I think he might pull
it out in the end.


298
0:9:26,64 --> 0:9:27,15
But we'll see.


299
0:9:27,15 --> 0:9:29,4
JENNA BUSCH: Wil is
very strategic.


300
0:9:29,4 --> 0:9:29,85
He's very calm.


301
0:9:29,85 --> 0:9:32,62
He's very helpful to
newbies like me.


302
0:9:32,62 --> 0:9:34,45
SEAN PLOTT: I'm going to lean
towards Wil because he just


303
0:9:34,45 --> 0:9:37,41
seems to know not only all the
good strategies but also all


304
0:9:37,41 --> 0:9:38,66
the voices.


305
0:9:38,66 --> 0:9:54,75



306
0:9:54,75 --> 0:9:55,72
WIL WHEATON: Please, go ahead.


307
0:9:55,72 --> 0:9:56,24
Conquer.


308
0:9:56,24 --> 0:9:57,595
SEAN PLOTT: Whatever you
do, no, no, no, no, no.


309
0:9:57,595 --> 0:9:58,5
No, no.


310
0:9:58,5 --> 0:9:58,515
OK.


311
0:9:58,515 --> 0:9:59,96
These are sorcerers
on the backside.


312
0:9:59,96 --> 0:10:1,21
JENNA BUSCH: Yeah, don't mess
with the sorcerers.


313
0:10:1,21 --> 0:10:2,46
SEAN PLOTT: Swamp?


314
0:10:2,46 --> 0:10:8,8



315
0:10:8,8 --> 0:10:9,54
WIL WHEATON: That's going
to cost you three.


316
0:10:9,54 --> 0:10:10,28
SEAN PLOTT: It's going
to cost you three.


317
0:10:10,28 --> 0:10:10,6
GRANT IMAHARA: And what?


318
0:10:10,6 --> 0:10:10,925
WIL WHEATON: Bam.


319
0:10:10,925 --> 0:10:13,99
GRANT IMAHARA: At the moment,
my wrath is focused on Sean.


320
0:10:13,99 --> 0:10:15,66
But that's just because he was
in the wrong place at the


321
0:10:15,66 --> 0:10:16,6
wrong time.


322
0:10:16,6 --> 0:10:17,63
SEAN PLOTT: This
is a massacre.


323
0:10:17,63 --> 0:10:18,31
JENNA BUSCH: You look upset.


324
0:10:18,31 --> 0:10:20,23
SEAN PLOTT: My strategy in the
game is try to avoid the fact


325
0:10:20,23 --> 0:10:21,2
that Grant is a dick.


326
0:10:21,2 --> 0:10:22,4
WIL WHEATON: This is
going to be ugly.


327
0:10:22,4 --> 0:10:24,38
GRANT IMAHARA: Gosh, that forest
looks awfully tempting.


328
0:10:24,38 --> 0:10:29,2
I'm hoping that beating up on
him early in the game is not


329
0:10:29,2 --> 0:10:31,6
going to come around
and backfire on me


330
0:10:31,6 --> 0:10:32,61
later in the game.


331
0:10:32,61 --> 0:10:33,6
SEAN PLOTT: Are you kidding?


332
0:10:33,6 --> 0:10:34,53
My next race is going
to start here.


333
0:10:34,53 --> 0:10:36,78
I'm just going to
hollow you out.


334
0:10:36,78 --> 0:10:37,63
GRANT IMAHARA: No!


335
0:10:37,63 --> 0:10:40,33
You're an orc and you're
rampaging.


336
0:10:40,33 --> 0:10:41,87
You got to do what
you got to do.


337
0:10:41,87 --> 0:10:43,26
Sorry, Sean.


338
0:10:43,26 --> 0:10:43,94
Oh, well.


339
0:10:43,94 --> 0:10:45,23
Two for that.


340
0:10:45,23 --> 0:10:46,25
WIL WHEATON: He's going
to play the pillaging


341
0:10:46,25 --> 0:10:48,825
Roto-Rooters in the next one.


342
0:10:48,825 --> 0:10:49,18
GRANT IMAHARA: All right.


343
0:10:49,18 --> 0:10:49,58
WIL WHEATON: OK.


344
0:10:49,58 --> 0:10:50,24
That's conquered.


345
0:10:50,24 --> 0:10:51,48
And one more.


346
0:10:51,48 --> 0:10:51,96
OK.


347
0:10:51,96 --> 0:10:52,99
And then roll.


348
0:10:52,99 --> 0:10:54,48
SEAN PLOTT: God, I hope
you get a blank.


349
0:10:54,48 --> 0:10:55,563
WIL WHEATON: Dice of blank.


350
0:10:55,563 --> 0:10:56,53
JENNA BUSCH: Dice
of blank, sir.


351
0:10:56,53 --> 0:10:57,0
GRANT IMAHARA: It's horrible.


352
0:10:57,0 --> 0:10:57,81
Two or a--


353
0:10:57,81 --> 0:10:58,67
SEAN PLOTT: Please
get a blank.


354
0:10:58,67 --> 0:11:1,49
Oh god, I'll be so
happy, I'll die.


355
0:11:1,49 --> 0:11:2,99
WIL WHEATON: Oh!


356
0:11:2,99 --> 0:11:3,51
SEAN PLOTT: Yes.


357
0:11:3,51 --> 0:11:5,91
WIL WHEATON: People who play
Small World a lot call this


358
0:11:5,91 --> 0:11:8,45
the dice of rolling blanks.


359
0:11:8,45 --> 0:11:11,18
But just to show you, look,
there's actual numbers on it.


360
0:11:11,18 --> 0:11:11,76
Look, you see that, Jessie?


361
0:11:11,76 --> 0:11:12,11
GRANT IMAHARA: Where?


362
0:11:12,11 --> 0:11:13,44
They only appear when
you're not rolling--


363
0:11:13,44 --> 0:11:13,79
JENNA BUSCH: Yeah.


364
0:11:13,79 --> 0:11:14,56
GRANT IMAHARA: --apparently.


365
0:11:14,56 --> 0:11:18,15
WIL WHEATON: You get two,
four, five, six,


366
0:11:18,15 --> 0:11:19,56
seven points this turn.


367
0:11:19,56 --> 0:11:20,32
SEAN PLOTT: Wait.


368
0:11:20,32 --> 0:11:21,82
Doesn't he get three for
these because he's


369
0:11:21,82 --> 0:11:22,59
the pillaging orcs?


370
0:11:22,59 --> 0:11:23,402
JENNA BUSCH: Are you
helping him?


371
0:11:23,402 --> 0:11:24,34
WIL WHEATON: Yeah, I
was giving him two.


372
0:11:24,34 --> 0:11:24,64
Oh, three!


373
0:11:24,64 --> 0:11:25,415
You're right.


374
0:11:25,415 --> 0:11:26,18
My bad.


375
0:11:26,18 --> 0:11:26,63
JENNA BUSCH: Don't help him!


376
0:11:26,63 --> 0:11:27,65
SEAN PLOTT: Wait a minute.


377
0:11:27,65 --> 0:11:27,96
[BEEP]


378
0:11:27,96 --> 0:11:29,12
you, Grant.


379
0:11:29,12 --> 0:11:30,49
JENNA BUSCH: I think you've
become that guy.


380
0:11:30,49 --> 0:11:31,58
GRANT IMAHARA: You
are a sportsman.


381
0:11:31,58 --> 0:11:31,83
Yeah.


382
0:11:31,83 --> 0:11:33,22
WIL WHEATON: So three, six--


383
0:11:33,22 --> 0:11:34,11
GRANT IMAHARA: Damn my
rules knowledge.


384
0:11:34,11 --> 0:11:36,27

of the rules.

0:11:36,27 --> 0:11:38,16
GRANT IMAHARA: And to
protect my borders.


386
0:11:38,16 --> 0:11:39,88
SEAN PLOTT: My race could be
the pacifist children.


387
0:11:39,88 --> 0:11:42,69
I would send all of
them your way.


388
0:11:42,69 --> 0:11:45,26
Next time I go into decline,
which will happen because I'm


389
0:11:45,26 --> 0:11:47,28
awful, I'm going
to invade him.


390
0:11:47,28 --> 0:11:48,11
GRANT IMAHARA: Ooh.


391
0:11:48,11 --> 0:11:48,86
SEAN PLOTT: He'll be picking
up his teeth


392
0:11:48,86 --> 0:11:49,93
like Pokemon cards.


393
0:11:49,93 --> 0:11:52,86
I see you, drinking
your Diet Coke.


394
0:11:52,86 --> 0:11:53,46
WIL WHEATON: All right.


395
0:11:53,46 --> 0:11:57,96
This is going to be super
gamble mania 9,000.

Are you ready?


397
0:11:58,51 --> 0:11:59,71

not this side.

0:12:0,19 --> 0:12:0,35
SEAN PLOTT: No.


400

do I see any mines?

0:12:2,73 --> 0:12:4,15
No.

SEAN PLOTT: It's going to
be gamble mania, Sean.


404
0:12:5,775 --> 0:12:6,835
I'm like no, no, no, no.


405
0:12:6,835 --> 0:12:7,28
Don't gamble.

What?


408
0:12:7,89 --> 0:12:8,26
What?


409
0:12:8,26 --> 0:12:8,63
What?


410
0:12:8,63 --> 0:12:9,24
What?


411
0:12:9,24 --> 0:12:10,525
These are my giants.


412
0:12:10,525 --> 0:12:11,51
WIL WHEATON: And now--


413
0:12:11,51 --> 0:12:12,76
SEAN PLOTT: Ohh!


414
0:12:12,76 --> 0:12:16,372



415
0:12:16,372 --> 0:12:17,83
JENNA BUSCH: There's
flailing happening.


416
0:12:17,83 --> 0:12:19,29
WIL WHEATON: Yes!


417
0:12:19,29 --> 0:12:20,78
SEAN PLOTT: He's going to stop
rolling threes eventually.


418
0:12:20,78 --> 0:12:22,58
Then I'm going to wreck him.


419
0:12:22,58 --> 0:12:23,47
WIL WHEATON: (SINGING)
"We are the dwarves.


420
0:12:23,47 --> 0:12:24,16
We like to mine.


421
0:12:24,16 --> 0:12:27,65
We get our gold, and we put it
in our pocket." It's the song


422
0:12:27,65 --> 0:12:28,86
that the dwarves sing.


423
0:12:28,86 --> 0:12:30,21
GRANT IMAHARA: You
took a beating.


424
0:12:30,21 --> 0:12:31,863
SEAN PLOTT: I don't really
like that song.


425
0:12:31,863 --> 0:12:32,71
GRANT IMAHARA: Yeah.


426
0:12:32,71 --> 0:12:33,12
WIL WHEATON: OK.


427
0:12:33,12 --> 0:12:35,11
And I'll just put this here so
everybody knows where my


428
0:12:35,11 --> 0:12:36,48
little guys did their thing.


429
0:12:36,48 --> 0:12:39,888
SEAN PLOTT: Well, I'll
just move this back.


430
0:12:39,888 --> 0:12:41,98
WIL WHEATON: And that will
be the end of my turn.


431
0:12:41,98 --> 0:12:42,59
All right, Jenna.


432
0:12:42,59 --> 0:12:42,91
JENNA BUSCH: All right.


433
0:12:42,91 --> 0:12:43,93
WIL WHEATON: It is your turn.


434
0:12:43,93 --> 0:12:46,765
JENNA BUSCH: I did pretty well
not attacking certain people,


435
0:12:46,765 --> 0:12:47,43
just saying.


436
0:12:47,43 --> 0:12:49,6
Because everyone sort
of left me alone.


437
0:12:49,6 --> 0:12:51,496
WIL WHEATON: Welcome
to round three!


438
0:12:51,496 --> 0:12:52,945
GRANT IMAHARA: Hey.


439
0:12:52,945 --> 0:12:56,1
JENNA BUSCH: And I'm going
to begin round three by--


440
0:12:56,1 --> 0:12:56,93
WIL WHEATON: Flipping a dwarf!


441
0:12:56,93 --> 0:12:57,89
GRANT IMAHARA: Oh.


442
0:12:57,89 --> 0:12:58,36
SEAN PLOTT: Get him.


443
0:12:58,36 --> 0:12:58,74
Get him.


444
0:12:58,74 --> 0:12:59,55
WIL WHEATON: Flip the dwarf!


445
0:12:59,55 --> 0:13:0,395
Good for you.


446
0:13:0,395 --> 0:13:1,23
Good move.


447
0:13:1,23 --> 0:13:6,3
I was so focused on protecting
myself from Sean's giants that


448
0:13:6,3 --> 0:13:10,88
I completely forgot to defend
myself against the sorcerers.


449
0:13:10,88 --> 0:13:14,32
Nothing makes me happier than
seeing a new player come in


450
0:13:14,32 --> 0:13:18,26
and just completely exploit a
total screw-up by a veteran.


451
0:13:18,26 --> 0:13:20,77
JENNA BUSCH: I try not to pick
on weak people in real life.


452
0:13:20,77 --> 0:13:22,33
I like to beat up the
really tough guys.


453
0:13:22,33 --> 0:13:23,24
It's more fun.


454
0:13:23,24 --> 0:13:24,105
WIL WHEATON: It looks
like Sean's putting


455
0:13:24,105 --> 0:13:25,99
the giants into decline.


456
0:13:25,99 --> 0:13:26,91
GRANT IMAHARA: Decline.


457
0:13:26,91 --> 0:13:28,83
SEAN PLOTT: Dude, they
had their moments.


458
0:13:28,83 --> 0:13:29,98
WIL WHEATON: I think
that's a good move.


459
0:13:29,98 --> 0:13:31,606
That's a super good move.


460
0:13:31,606 --> 0:13:38,438



461
0:13:38,438 --> 0:13:40,28
SEAN PLOTT: It's the
quickest move ever.


462
0:13:40,28 --> 0:13:40,56
WIL WHEATON: Yep.


463
0:13:40,56 --> 0:13:43,25
So you get four points
this turn.


464
0:13:43,25 --> 0:13:44,9
Grant.


465
0:13:44,9 --> 0:13:45,29
GRANT IMAHARA: All right.


466
0:13:45,29 --> 0:13:46,755
It's time to go a'pillaging.


467
0:13:46,755 --> 0:13:49,95
SEAN PLOTT: If you can go
a'pillaging, like, that way.


468
0:13:49,95 --> 0:13:50,24
GRANT IMAHARA: No.


469
0:13:50,24 --> 0:13:52,36
I think I'm going to
leave that one--


470
0:13:52,36 --> 0:13:53,275
SEAN PLOTT: God bless you.


471
0:13:53,275 --> 0:13:54,4
GRANT IMAHARA: --and
take this.


472
0:13:54,4 --> 0:13:54,695
SEAN PLOTT: No.


473
0:13:54,695 --> 0:13:55,19
Wh--?


474
0:13:55,19 --> 0:13:56,79
WIL WHEATON: Does the
die help Grant?


475
0:13:56,79 --> 0:13:59,152
Grant.


476
0:13:59,152 --> 0:13:59,92
JENNA BUSCH: You did not.


477
0:13:59,92 --> 0:14:2,46
GRANT IMAHARA: It jumped
up my arm.


478
0:14:2,46 --> 0:14:2,76
WIL WHEATON: Wow.


479
0:14:2,76 --> 0:14:4,3
That was like, I'm
going for it.


480
0:14:4,3 --> 0:14:4,79
I'm kissing him.


481
0:14:4,79 --> 0:14:5,26
SEAN PLOTT: OK.


482
0:14:5,26 --> 0:14:5,68
OK.


483
0:14:5,68 --> 0:14:5,935
OK.


484
0:14:5,935 --> 0:14:6,94
That's fine.


485
0:14:6,94 --> 0:14:7,4
That's fine.


486
0:14:7,4 --> 0:14:8,88
WIL WHEATON: That counts
because it was awesome.


487
0:14:8,88 --> 0:14:10,96
SEAN PLOTT: Dude, it's
like, blank, blank.


488
0:14:10,96 --> 0:14:11,49
Who are we invading?


489
0:14:11,49 --> 0:14:11,78
Sean?


490
0:14:11,78 --> 0:14:13,14
Look, another three came up.


491
0:14:13,14 --> 0:14:13,7
Isn't that funny?


492
0:14:13,7 --> 0:14:15,18
WIL WHEATON: Did you do
something horrible to like the


493
0:14:15,18 --> 0:14:18,29
die maker's family?


494
0:14:18,29 --> 0:14:19,53
JENNA BUSCH: Are you drawing
pictures in the velvet?


495
0:14:19,53 --> 0:14:21,36
SEAN PLOTT: I'm trying to do an
unhappy face, but instead


496
0:14:21,36 --> 0:14:23,65
it looks like that boy who's
just starting puberty and


497
0:14:23,65 --> 0:14:26,49
grows like a little bit
of side mustache.


498
0:14:26,49 --> 0:14:26,98
GRANT IMAHARA: What was that?


499
0:14:26,98 --> 0:14:27,51
SEAN PLOTT: It's,
like, so tragic.


500
0:14:27,51 --> 0:14:27,61
WIL WHEATON: OK.


501
0:14:27,61 --> 0:14:28,63
Let's count up your points.


502
0:14:28,63 --> 0:14:30,3
SEAN PLOTT: This is actually
either a simple


503
0:14:30,3 --> 0:14:31,13
three from this way.


504
0:14:31,13 --> 0:14:36,89
WIL WHEATON: You give 3, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11 points to Grant.


505
0:14:36,89 --> 0:14:38,79
SEAN PLOTT: Now there's the end
game victory condition.


506
0:14:38,79 --> 0:14:41,17
And there is the user defined
victory condition, which is


507
0:14:41,17 --> 0:14:41,5
[BEEP]


508
0:14:41,5 --> 0:14:44,6
invading Grant from right
there on my next race.


509
0:14:44,6 --> 0:14:45,85
GRANT IMAHARA: That's right.


510
0:14:45,85 --> 0:15:2,42



511
0:15:2,42 --> 0:15:6,38
The orcs are going
to go in decline.


512
0:15:6,38 --> 0:15:7,24
WIL WHEATON: The
declining orcs?


513
0:15:7,24 --> 0:15:7,79
GRANT IMAHARA: Yes.


514
0:15:7,79 --> 0:15:8,91
WIL WHEATON: They've
had a great run.


515
0:15:8,91 --> 0:15:9,55
GRANT IMAHARA: We did.


516
0:15:9,55 --> 0:15:10,82
We pillaged a lot.


517
0:15:10,82 --> 0:15:11,52
WIL WHEATON: All right.


518
0:15:11,52 --> 0:15:11,17
Let's see.


519
0:15:11,17 --> 0:15:12,34
So we'll take these
two off the map.


520
0:15:12,34 --> 0:15:12,451
SEAN PLOTT: Yeah.


521
0:15:12,451 --> 0:15:14,23
Let me just say that every
time I come home and my


522
0:15:14,23 --> 0:15:16,36
roommates have TiVoed
Mythbusters, I'm going to get


523
0:15:16,36 --> 0:15:17,99
red in the face and be like--


524
0:15:17,99 --> 0:15:19,31
GRANT IMAHARA: Oh,
that Grant guy.


525
0:15:19,31 --> 0:15:20,81
He pillaged me.


526
0:15:20,81 --> 0:15:21,72
Right through the back door.


527
0:15:21,72 --> 0:15:22,62
SEAN PLOTT: I can't
do it direct.


528
0:15:22,62 --> 0:15:23,72
I have to be, like,
passive-aggressive.


529
0:15:23,72 --> 0:15:27,41
I'll be like, it's
not real science.


530
0:15:27,41 --> 0:15:28,18
GRANT IMAHARA: It's
TV science.


531
0:15:28,18 --> 0:15:28,47
SEAN PLOTT: Yes.


532
0:15:28,47 --> 0:15:28,97
WIL WHEATON: OK.


533
0:15:28,97 --> 0:15:32,47
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.


534
0:15:32,47 --> 0:15:33,24
SEAN PLOTT: These orcs are
going to go into decline.


535
0:15:33,24 --> 0:15:34,78
WIL WHEATON: Eight
points for you.


536
0:15:34,78 --> 0:15:36,37
SEAN PLOTT: And then we're just
going to blow them up.


537
0:15:36,37 --> 0:15:37,97
WIL WHEATON: Duh, duh,
duh, duh, duh.


538
0:15:37,97 --> 0:15:39,85
We're going to eat you
for first breakfast.


539
0:15:39,85 --> 0:15:40,76
Ta, dah, da, dah.


540
0:15:40,76 --> 0:15:42,59
we're going to eat your
for second breakfast.


541
0:15:42,59 --> 0:15:44,11
La, la, la, la, la.


542
0:15:44,11 --> 0:15:46,82
And for elevensies, we're going
to try to roll in here


543
0:15:46,82 --> 0:15:49,825
and see if we can get you
with the die roll.


544
0:15:49,825 --> 0:15:50,31
SEAN PLOTT: Oh!


545
0:15:50,31 --> 0:15:51,17
WIL WHEATON: Yes!


546
0:15:51,17 --> 0:15:51,64
SEAN PLOTT: Oh, wait.


547
0:15:51,64 --> 0:15:52,54
Is that tilted?


548
0:15:52,54 --> 0:15:52,97
Oh my god.


549
0:15:52,97 --> 0:15:53,32
JENNA BUSCH: Oh, it is.


550
0:15:53,32 --> 0:15:53,66
It is.


551
0:15:53,66 --> 0:15:56,6
WIL WHEATON: No, it's not.


552
0:15:56,6 --> 0:15:58,14
Awesome in the pants.


553
0:15:58,14 --> 0:15:58,43
OK.


554
0:15:58,43 --> 0:15:59,24
So let's see.


555
0:15:59,24 --> 0:16:1,622
That means that I get
two, three, four--


556
0:16:1,622 --> 0:16:2,584
SEAN PLOTT: That's just
a blow to humanity.


557
0:16:2,584 --> 0:16:4,3
WIL WHEATON: --five, six,
seven, eight, nine


558
0:16:4,3 --> 0:16:6,37
points for that turn.


559
0:16:6,37 --> 0:16:7,8
And that'll be the
end of my turn.


560
0:16:7,8 --> 0:16:8,91
Jenna, it's your turn.


561
0:16:8,91 --> 0:16:9,83
And you get to choose
a new race.


562
0:16:9,83 --> 0:16:12,91
And also, welcome to round
six, everyone.


563
0:16:12,91 --> 0:16:14,15
This round is not a number.


564
0:16:14,15 --> 0:16:15,4
It is a free man.


565
0:16:15,4 --> 0:16:17,918



566
0:16:17,918 --> 0:16:19,27
JENNA BUSCH: You know which
one I'm picking, right?


567
0:16:19,27 --> 0:16:20,15
WIL WHEATON: What
are you taking?


568
0:16:20,15 --> 0:16:20,46
JENNA BUSCH: Dragon.


569
0:16:20,46 --> 0:16:21,75
SEAN PLOTT: Oh, you
love dragons.


570
0:16:21,75 --> 0:16:35,515



571
0:16:35,515 --> 0:16:36,22
JENNA BUSCH: All right.


572
0:16:36,22 --> 0:16:37,3
WIL WHEATON: Where you going?


573
0:16:37,3 --> 0:16:39,32
JENNA BUSCH: I'm going
to go here.


574
0:16:39,32 --> 0:16:40,98
WIL WHEATON: One, OK.


575
0:16:40,98 --> 0:16:42,97
It normally would cost you two,
but because it's adjacent


576
0:16:42,97 --> 0:16:44,25
to water, it only
costs you one.


577
0:16:44,25 --> 0:16:44,68
JENNA BUSCH: Yes.


578
0:16:44,68 --> 0:16:45,38
WIL WHEATON: OK.


579
0:16:45,38 --> 0:16:46,12
JENNA BUSCH: I'm going to go--


580
0:16:46,12 --> 0:16:46,43
WIL WHEATON: OK.


581
0:16:46,43 --> 0:16:46,85

582
0:16:46,85 --> 0:16:47,69
JENNA BUSCH: --here.


583
0:16:47,69 --> 0:16:48,74
WIL WHEATON: Two.


584
0:16:48,74 --> 0:16:50,28
Because there's a dude there.


585
0:16:50,28 --> 0:16:51,63
So put one more down there--


586
0:16:51,63 --> 0:16:51,74
JENNA BUSCH: Oh, right.


587
0:16:51,74 --> 0:16:52,79
WIL WHEATON: --for
the lost tribe.


588
0:16:52,79 --> 0:16:53,13
JENNA BUSCH: Dude.


589
0:16:53,13 --> 0:16:53,43
GRANT IMAHARA: Got it.


590
0:16:53,43 --> 0:16:56,366
WIL WHEATON: But I love fish
and things that have forks.


591
0:16:56,366 --> 0:16:57,292
OK.


592
0:16:57,292 --> 0:16:58,681
OK.


593
0:16:58,681 --> 0:16:59,15
JENNA BUSCH: All right.


594
0:16:59,15 --> 0:17:1,29
So is this technically--?


595
0:17:1,29 --> 0:17:2,25
WIL WHEATON: Yes, this
is adjacent to water.


596
0:17:2,25 --> 0:17:2,46
Yep.


597
0:17:2,46 --> 0:17:3,14
It sure is.


598
0:17:3,14 --> 0:17:3,875
JENNA BUSCH: All right.


599
0:17:3,875 --> 0:17:4,765
All right.


600
0:17:4,765 --> 0:17:6,5
GRANT IMAHARA: I'm getting
pushed out of here.


601
0:17:6,5 --> 0:17:6,75
JENNA BUSCH: Yep.


602
0:17:6,75 --> 0:17:7,49
GRANT IMAHARA: Oh.


603
0:17:7,49 --> 0:17:8,264
WIL WHEATON: Orc,
orc, orc, orc.


604
0:17:8,264 --> 0:17:12,619
SEAN PLOTT: That's what that's
like, pillaging orc Grant.


605
0:17:12,619 --> 0:17:14,4
GRANT IMAHARA: Is this
the payback I was--


606
0:17:14,4 --> 0:17:15,2
JENNA BUSCH: Mm-hmm.


607
0:17:15,2 --> 0:17:15,63
WIL WHEATON: OK.


608
0:17:15,63 --> 0:17:16,39
JENNA BUSCH: All right.


609
0:17:16,39 --> 0:17:17,79
I think--


610
0:17:17,79 --> 0:17:19,3
GRANT IMAHARA: You've just got
a giant stack over there.


611
0:17:19,3 --> 0:17:19,31
JENNA BUSCH: I do.


612
0:17:19,31 --> 0:17:20,0
WIL WHEATON: She has a lot.


613
0:17:20,0 --> 0:17:21,7
This is going to be a
huge turn for her.


614
0:17:21,7 --> 0:17:24,64
Orc, orc, orc, orc.


615
0:17:24,64 --> 0:17:25,14
JENNA BUSCH: Yep.


616
0:17:25,14 --> 0:17:26,69
I think--


617
0:17:26,69 --> 0:17:28,4
SEAN PLOTT: Can you go, like,
here and then here, in terms


618
0:17:28,4 --> 0:17:28,86
of conquering?


619
0:17:28,86 --> 0:17:28,986
WIL WHEATON: Yeah.


620
0:17:28,986 --> 0:17:31,7
As long as you're adjacent,
you can attack.


621
0:17:31,7 --> 0:17:31,83
JENNA BUSCH: Do it again.


622
0:17:31,83 --> 0:17:34,27
WIL WHEATON: Orc, orc, orc,
orc, orc, orc, orc.


623
0:17:34,27 --> 0:17:35,38
Now how many dudes
do you have left?


624
0:17:35,38 --> 0:17:36,14
JENNA BUSCH: I have two.


625
0:17:36,14 --> 0:17:37,61
WIL WHEATON: OK Now, if you're
going to attack with your


626
0:17:37,61 --> 0:17:40,11
dragon, a dude has to accompany
your dragon.


627
0:17:40,11 --> 0:17:41,44
He's the guy who keeps the
dragon on a leash.


628
0:17:41,44 --> 0:17:41,59
JENNA BUSCH: Oh.


629
0:17:41,59 --> 0:17:41,84
Oh.


630
0:17:41,84 --> 0:17:43,89
WIL WHEATON: And he's like,
no, don't kill them.


631
0:17:43,89 --> 0:17:45,44
Kill the hobbits over there.


632
0:17:45,44 --> 0:17:45,96
JENNA BUSCH: Dragon wrangler.


633
0:17:45,96 --> 0:17:48,8
WIL WHEATON: So what
you want to do--


634
0:17:48,8 --> 0:17:49,535
I can't believe I'm going
to tell you this--


635
0:17:49,535 --> 0:17:50,19
JENNA BUSCH: Tell me this.


636
0:17:50,19 --> 0:17:51,99
WIL WHEATON: But you probably
just want to take your dragon


637
0:17:51,99 --> 0:17:52,65
there and there.


638
0:17:52,65 --> 0:17:53,84
Because those are
your [INAUDIBLE]


639
0:17:53,84 --> 0:17:55,82
JENNA BUSCH: Uh-huh.


640
0:17:55,82 --> 0:17:56,48
SEAN PLOTT: I think
she bought it.


641
0:17:56,48 --> 0:17:58,306
WIL WHEATON: But listen, what
you're trying to do is--


642
0:17:58,306 --> 0:17:58,44
SEAN PLOTT: Got her.


643
0:17:58,44 --> 0:18:0,83
WIL WHEATON: She's not even
listening to me that much.


644
0:18:0,83 --> 0:18:2,21
She's like, keep talking,
Wheaton.


645
0:18:2,21 --> 0:18:3,535
That's adorable that
you said--


646
0:18:3,535 --> 0:18:4,41
JENNA BUSCH: I'm just
so psyched I got


647
0:18:4,41 --> 0:18:5,64
to play with a dragon.


648
0:18:5,64 --> 0:18:7,93
WIL WHEATON: So now what happens
is the hobbits get


649
0:18:7,93 --> 0:18:9,85
burninated.


650
0:18:9,85 --> 0:18:11,44
One of them goes into
the land of death.


651
0:18:11,44 --> 0:18:14,124
And I get to keep two of the
ones that are still alive.


652
0:18:14,124 --> 0:18:14,621
JENNA BUSCH: All right.


653
0:18:14,621 --> 0:18:16,32
And I'm going to try--


654
0:18:16,32 --> 0:18:17,8
SEAN PLOTT: Oh, sad timing.


655
0:18:17,8 --> 0:18:17,53
JENNA BUSCH: I shouldn't.


656
0:18:17,53 --> 0:18:17,802
GRANT IMAHARA: All right.


657
0:18:17,802 --> 0:18:18,55
Go ahead.


658
0:18:18,55 --> 0:18:19,5
You're on a roll.


659
0:18:19,5 --> 0:18:19,66
SEAN PLOTT: Come on!


660
0:18:19,66 --> 0:18:20,37
Come on!


661
0:18:20,37 --> 0:18:21,47
WIL WHEATON: So normally you
would need four there.


662
0:18:21,47 --> 0:18:21,57
JENNA BUSCH: Yeah.


663
0:18:21,57 --> 0:18:22,46
WIL WHEATON: You need three.


664
0:18:22,46 --> 0:18:23,99
You have one, so you need to
roll a two or a three.


665
0:18:23,99 --> 0:18:24,5
SEAN PLOTT: Come on.


666
0:18:24,5 --> 0:18:25,135
Come on, three.


667
0:18:25,135 --> 0:18:25,44
JENNA BUSCH: Oh my god.


668
0:18:25,44 --> 0:18:27,12
It hasn't worked for me yet.


669
0:18:27,12 --> 0:18:27,6
SEAN PLOTT: Hurt him.


670
0:18:27,6 --> 0:18:27,93
GRANT IMAHARA: Oh!


671
0:18:27,93 --> 0:18:30,63
WIL WHEATON: Oh!


672
0:18:30,63 --> 0:18:32,8
GRANT IMAHARA: Bye-bye.


673
0:18:32,8 --> 0:18:32,57
SEAN PLOTT: Yes.


674
0:18:32,57 --> 0:18:34,75
WIL WHEATON: [INAUDIBLE]
the Shire, Samwise.


675
0:18:34,75 --> 0:18:37,73
You should have just ridden on
the eagles to take the rings


676
0:18:37,73 --> 0:18:39,98
back to Mordor.


677
0:18:39,98 --> 0:18:40,1
Why are you so stupid?


678
0:18:40,1 --> 0:18:40,922
Ahh.


679
0:18:40,922 --> 0:18:42,29
Now let's count your--


680
0:18:42,29 --> 0:18:42,406
OK.


681
0:18:42,406 --> 0:18:43,37
You had a sorcerer.


682
0:18:43,37 --> 0:18:44,31
That's one.


683
0:18:44,31 --> 0:18:45,83
I don't think you have any more
sorcerers on the board.


684
0:18:45,83 --> 0:18:46,4
JENNA BUSCH: No.


685
0:18:46,4 --> 0:18:46,79
That's it.


686
0:18:46,79 --> 0:18:50,579
WIL WHEATON: Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.


687
0:18:50,579 --> 0:18:51,46
Eight.


688
0:18:51,46 --> 0:18:52,0
Eight points for Jenna.


689
0:18:52,0 --> 0:18:52,43
JENNA BUSCH: Whoo.


690
0:18:52,43 --> 0:18:53,225
GRANT IMAHARA: Big round.


691
0:18:53,225 --> 0:18:53,73
JENNA BUSCH: Why, thank you.


692
0:18:53,73 --> 0:18:56,336
WIL WHEATON: I believe the turn
now belongs to you, sir.


693
0:18:56,336 --> 0:18:57,97
SEAN PLOTT: I'm gonna take it.


694
0:18:57,97 --> 0:18:59,12
Go into decline.


695
0:18:59,12 --> 0:19:0,245
WIL WHEATON: You lose heroic.


696
0:19:0,245 --> 0:19:1,16
So heroic goes away.


697
0:19:1,16 --> 0:19:2,37
You're no longer heroic.


698
0:19:2,37 --> 0:19:4,87
But we'll put your ghouls
into decline.


699
0:19:4,87 --> 0:19:7,17
But what's awesome about that is
that they still behave like


700
0:19:7,17 --> 0:19:7,73
an active race.


701
0:19:7,73 --> 0:19:11,5
So go ahead and conquer
some territories with


702
0:19:11,5 --> 0:19:12,69
your declined ghouls.


703
0:19:12,69 --> 0:19:15,5
SEAN PLOTT: Oh, I get to
do that afterwards?


704
0:19:15,5 --> 0:19:15,91
WIL WHEATON: Yeah.


705
0:19:15,91 --> 0:19:17,48
That's why the ghouls
are badass.


706
0:19:17,48 --> 0:19:17,97
SEAN PLOTT: What?


707
0:19:17,97 --> 0:19:18,9
Wait.


708
0:19:18,9 --> 0:19:18,24
WIL WHEATON: Yeah.


709
0:19:18,24 --> 0:19:19,69
You actually played ghouls
really well.


710
0:19:19,69 --> 0:19:21,0
I thought you were being
super strategic.


711
0:19:21,0 --> 0:19:22,2
That's what you do.


712
0:19:22,2 --> 0:19:23,78
SEAN PLOTT: I super
stratege-did-did.


713
0:19:23,78 --> 0:19:25,58
WIL WHEATON: You grab the
ghouls, you roll as quick as


714
0:19:25,58 --> 0:19:27,545
you can, and then you hop into
decline immediately.


715
0:19:27,545 --> 0:19:29,4
SEAN PLOTT: And then
I'm, like, done.


716
0:19:29,4 --> 0:19:29,58
WIL WHEATON: Yeah.


717
0:19:29,58 --> 0:19:31,76
SEAN PLOTT: Race number
three en route.


718
0:19:31,76 --> 0:19:32,0
WIL WHEATON: Yeah.


719
0:19:32,0 --> 0:19:32,63
Let's hear.


720
0:19:32,63 --> 0:19:33,83
Who's coming in next?


721
0:19:33,83 --> 0:19:34,15
SEAN PLOTT: Wait.


722
0:19:34,15 --> 0:19:35,69
OK.


723
0:19:35,69 --> 0:19:35,89
OK.


724
0:19:35,89 --> 0:19:37,34
So you have a race in decline.


725
0:19:37,34 --> 0:19:38,45
You're going to attack me.


726
0:19:38,45 --> 0:19:39,47
Why would you do that?


727
0:19:39,47 --> 0:19:41,96
I can't believe--


728
0:19:41,96 --> 0:19:43,6
GRANT IMAHARA: I haven't
selected anything.


729
0:19:43,6 --> 0:19:43,99
SEAN PLOTT: I can't believe it.


730
0:19:43,99 --> 0:19:44,34
OK.


731
0:19:44,34 --> 0:19:44,84
Wait.


732
0:19:44,84 --> 0:19:45,11
Hold on.


733
0:19:45,11 --> 0:19:48,27
I'm going to try to roll
for that back one.


734
0:19:48,27 --> 0:19:49,42
WIL WHEATON: Roll for
which one here?


735
0:19:49,42 --> 0:19:49,76
SEAN PLOTT: For that forest.


736
0:19:49,76 --> 0:19:50,1
WIL WHEATON: For here?


737
0:19:50,1 --> 0:19:50,44
SEAN PLOTT: Yeah.


738
0:19:50,44 --> 0:19:50,85
WIL WHEATON: All right.


739
0:19:50,85 --> 0:19:51,13
Go.


740
0:19:51,13 --> 0:19:52,51
You need to roll-- actually,
you have a 50%


741
0:19:52,51 --> 0:19:53,57
chance of making it.


742
0:19:53,57 --> 0:19:54,34
SEAN PLOTT: Oh, god.


743
0:19:54,34 --> 0:19:56,96
That's so low for me.


744
0:19:56,96 --> 0:19:56,81
Oh, god.


745
0:19:56,81 --> 0:19:58,68
GRANT IMAHARA: Come on.


746
0:19:58,68 --> 0:19:59,14
SEAN PLOTT: Oh!


747
0:19:59,14 --> 0:19:59,57
Oh!


748
0:19:59,57 --> 0:19:59,976
WIL WHEATON: Yeah.


749
0:19:59,976 --> 0:20:0,788
You got it.


750
0:20:0,788 --> 0:20:1,6
Congratulations.


751
0:20:1,6 --> 0:20:2,36
SEAN PLOTT: I pulled
what we call a


752
0:20:2,36 --> 0:20:4,635
college, the bare minimum.


753
0:20:4,635 --> 0:20:5,405
Done.


754
0:20:5,405 --> 0:20:7,13
GRANT IMAHARA: All right.


755
0:20:7,13 --> 0:20:7,33
what.


756
0:20:7,33 --> 0:20:8,54
Will I choose?


757
0:20:8,54 --> 0:20:10,33
I think it's going to
be swamp ratmen.


758
0:20:10,33 --> 0:20:11,58
WIL WHEATON: Swamp ratmen.


759
0:20:11,58 --> 0:20:26,35



760
0:20:26,35 --> 0:20:29,11
GRANT IMAHARA: I shall be
entering on the swamp.


761
0:20:29,11 --> 0:20:29,37
WIL WHEATON: OK.

0:20:29,37 --> 0:20:30,681
GRANT IMAHARA: There you go.


763
0:20:30,681 --> 0:20:31,12
That's right.


764
0:20:31,12 --> 0:20:31,86
I'll move over here.


765
0:20:31,86 --> 0:20:32,23
WIL WHEATON: OK.


766
0:20:32,23 --> 0:20:32,396
Go ahead.


767
0:20:32,396 --> 0:20:32,565
Go ahead.


768
0:20:32,565 --> 0:20:32,9
Do it.


769
0:20:32,9 --> 0:20:33,15
SEAN PLOTT: What?


770
0:20:33,15 --> 0:20:33,3
WIL WHEATON: Go next.

0:20:33,3 --> 0:20:33,36
Go next.


772
0:20:33,36 --> 0:20:35,94
SEAN PLOTT: You can't put the
capitals next to each other.


773
0:20:35,94 --> 0:20:38,252
This is like East and West
Germany here, man.


774

WIL WHEATON: Oh, no.


775
0:20:39,315 --> 0:20:40,59
I'm a dead ghoul now.


776
0:20:40,59 --> 0:20:42,292

WIL WHEATON: No.


779
0:20:44,975 --> 0:20:47,59
You can attack one after
another, but they


780
0:20:47,59 --> 0:20:48,86
can't all join up.


781
0:20:48,86 --> 0:20:51,235
It can't be like ghouls and
these other guys are friends.


782
0:20:51,235 --> 0:20:51,57
Oh, no.


783
0:20:51,57 --> 0:20:54,62
It sucks to be a ghoul.

to march that way


785
0:20:56,25 --> 0:20:57,47
towards the other swamp.


786
0:20:57,47 --> 0:21:1,4
So I will take you.

keeping track in my


788
0:21:2,6 --> 0:21:3,225
head of score.


789
0:21:3,225 --> 0:21:5,79
And yeah, you're actually really
far ahead of everybody.


790

strong at this moment.

But we'll see.

0:21:15,27 --> 0:21:16,52
I've got an early lead.


797
0:21:16,52 --> 0:21:17,77
I'm keeping it.

round of the game.

of choosing a new race


804
0:21:39,59 --> 0:21:41,42
and doing what you
will with it.


805
0:21:41,42 --> 0:21:41,68
JENNA BUSCH: Oh.

All right.

my consolation

prize for dead last.


814
0:22:2,1 --> 0:22:2,76

So if you wanted to,

GRANT IMAHARA: Oh, no.


828
0:22:13,83 --> 0:22:15,1
WIL WHEATON: It's like
you're getting three.


829
0:22:15,1 --> 0:22:17,11
So you would normally have
to attack with four


830
0:22:17,11 --> 0:22:17,79
to get there, right?


831
0:22:17,79 --> 0:22:19,78
But you get to squash
it for one.


832
0:22:19,78 --> 0:22:20,193

My ratmen are sitting
ducks out there.

0:22:26,76 --> 0:22:27,43
This is bad.


837
0:22:27,43 --> 0:22:29,22
This is really bad.


838
0:22:29,22 --> 0:22:31,14

a necklace of ratmen.


839

Wear it everywhere.

So that ratman goes away.


843
0:22:34,88 --> 0:22:36,12
GRANT IMAHARA: My ratman
kingdom is quickly


844
0:22:36,12 --> 0:22:36,583
evaporating.


845
0:22:36,583 --> 0:22:38,28
SEAN PLOTT: I've spent
all game--


846
0:22:38,28 --> 0:22:38,49

GRANT IMAHARA: Oh!


854
0:22:43,81 --> 0:22:45,235
WIL WHEATON: Normally you'd need
four, but you actually


855

only need one.


856
0:22:46,0 --> 0:22:46,952
Aw, man.


857
0:22:46,952 --> 0:22:47,43
Oh, no.


858
0:22:47,43 --> 0:22:48,8
JENNA BUSCH: Oh, this is fun.


859

I like the crazy bitches.

WIL WHEATON: Shut up!

SEAN PLOTT: How do
you run so good?


865
0:22:53,69 --> 0:22:54,19
WIL WHEATON: Did you
see that, Grant?


866
0:22:54,19 --> 0:22:56,19
JENNA BUSCH: Because I suck
the rest of the game.

right on the edge.

Here you go.

probabilistically impossible.

to go there.


879

888
0:23:21,22 --> 0:23:22,567

So one.

Or is this for any territory?

SEAN PLOTT: All right.


916
0:24:9,2 --> 0:24:10,72

up with a backstory for me.

put this with my collection.

GRANT IMAHARA: Kids, let this
be a lesson to you.

If you're mean to all the other
players at the beginning

0:24:28,86 --> 0:24:31,61
of the game, they will
gang up on you.


931
0:24:31,61 --> 0:24:35,328
And at the end of the game, you
got three lousy ratmen.


932
0:24:35,328 --> 0:24:36,6
SEAN PLOTT: I'm going
to make it intense.


933
0:24:36,6 --> 0:24:37,32

GRANT IMAHARA: They're
going on the swamp.

off the board.

Somehow.

You sold that so well, I was
like oh, god, did I mess up?

I'm really disappointed
in you.


951

squish one last fish.

of them face down.

Does everyone know how many
points they have?

60 right now.

But I haven't flipped
these last five.

0:25:52,92 --> 0:25:53,86
WIL WHEATON: Grant.


997
0:25:53,86 --> 0:25:54,43
GRANT IMAHARA: All right.


998
0:25:54,43 --> 0:25:57,68
So this is 10, 20, 30, 40.


999
0:25:57,68 --> 0:26:0,44
SEAN PLOTT: God, my heart
is beating so fast.


1000
0:26:0,44 --> 0:26:2,27
GRANT IMAHARA: 41.


1001
0:26:2,27 --> 0:26:4,835
WIL WHEATON: 51, 61.


1002
0:26:4,835 --> 0:26:6,29
You did this on purpose.


1003
0:26:6,29 --> 0:26:7,8
GRANT IMAHARA: I sure did.


1004
0:26:7,8 --> 0:26:9,16
WIL WHEATON: 71.


1005
0:26:9,16 --> 0:26:9,325
SEAN PLOTT: Wait.


1006
0:26:9,325 --> 0:26:9,811
What?


1007
0:26:9,811 --> 0:26:10,673
JENNA BUSCH: Woah.


1008
0:26:10,673 --> 0:26:12,4
WIL WHEATON: 81.


1009
0:26:12,4 --> 0:26:12,66
SEAN PLOTT: Wait.


1010
0:26:12,66 --> 0:26:13,36
Oh my god.


1011
0:26:13,36 --> 0:26:13,6
Wait.


1012
0:26:13,6 --> 0:26:13,98
Hey, whoa.


1013
0:26:13,98 --> 0:26:15,23
What the [BEEP]?


1014
0:26:15,23 --> 0:26:17,56



1015
0:26:17,56 --> 0:26:19,24
Oh my god.


1016
0:26:19,24 --> 0:26:26,58
WIL WHEATON: 10, 20, 30,
40, 50, 60, 70, 85.


1017
0:26:26,58 --> 0:26:29,46
GRANT IMAHARA: No!


1018
0:26:29,46 --> 0:26:29,53
WIL WHEATON: Jenna.


1019
0:26:29,53 --> 0:26:30,205
SEAN PLOTT: Oh my god.


1020
0:26:30,205 --> 0:26:30,69
JENNA BUSCH: 74.


1021
0:26:30,69 --> 0:26:32,17
I could be dramatic,
but it's-- yeah.


1022
0:26:32,17 --> 0:26:33,19
WIL WHEATON: 74.


1023
0:26:33,19 --> 0:26:34,75
Sean, you win the game!


1024
0:26:34,75 --> 0:26:35,94
SEAN PLOTT: I didn't
even know.


1025
0:26:35,94 --> 0:26:38,692
I thought I was in dead last.


1026
0:26:38,692 --> 0:26:39,564
GRANT IMAHARA: Ohh.


1027
0:26:39,564 --> 0:26:41,54
WIL WHEATON: Do you want
to take a lap around


1028
0:26:41,54 --> 0:26:42,436
the table or something?


1029
0:26:42,436 --> 0:26:43,308
JENNA BUSCH: I think
that you should.


1030
0:26:43,308 --> 0:26:44,18
WIL WHEATON: It feels good.


1031
0:26:44,18 --> 0:26:46,25
SEAN PLOTT: I started out
enraged because Grant kept


1032
0:26:46,25 --> 0:26:48,83
invading my territory and
getting, like, 11, 12 point


1033
0:26:48,83 --> 0:26:50,39
turns back to back to back.


1034
0:26:50,39 --> 0:26:54,64
However, Jenna kindly invaded
his homelands, giving me the


1035
0:26:54,64 --> 0:26:56,29
chance to catch up in
the last few rounds.


1036
0:26:56,29 --> 0:26:58,69
GRANT IMAHARA: I was completely
paralyzed.


1037
0:26:58,69 --> 0:27:2,38
I think I scored the lowest
I had the entire game.


1038
0:27:2,38 --> 0:27:5,52
JENNA BUSCH: I'd also like to
point out that I took him down


1039
0:27:5,52 --> 0:27:8,11
with the only female character
in the game.


1040
0:27:8,11 --> 0:27:10,69
WIL WHEATON: I had no idea that
I was going to lose this


1041
0:27:10,69 --> 0:27:12,17
by just two points.


1042
0:27:12,17 --> 0:27:13,0
SEAN PLOTT: Total luck for me.


1043
0:27:13,0 --> 0:27:16,45
I was just a participator in the
coincidence that wound up


1044
0:27:16,45 --> 0:27:17,35
giving me victories.


1045
0:27:17,35 --> 0:27:18,246
WIL WHEATON: What
a great game!


1046
0:27:18,246 --> 0:27:19,496
GRANT IMAHARA: Oh my god.


1047
0:27:19,496 --> 0:27:26,0



1048
0:27:26,0 --> 0:27:28,6
WIL WHEATON: You know, the
only thing worse than me


1049
0:27:28,6 --> 0:27:30,57
thinking you were going to win
was actually thinking I was


1050
0:27:30,57 --> 0:27:31,44
going to win.


1051
0:27:31,44 --> 0:27:32,99
JENNA BUSCH: I never thought
I was going to win.


1052
0:27:32,99 --> 0:27:34,852
WIL WHEATON: And then losing
by two points.


1053
0:27:34,852 --> 0:27:37,27
GRANT IMAHARA: Right in the last
round, that's where it


1054
0:27:37,27 --> 0:27:38,231
went wrong.


1055
0:27:38,231 --> 0:27:39,704
No!


1056
0:27:39,704 --> 0:27:41,177
WIL WHEATON: Will you
play it again?


1057
0:27:41,177 --> 0:27:41,67
JENNA BUSCH: Yes.


1058
0:27:41,67 --> 0:27:42,72
WIL WHEATON: That's awesome.


1059
0:27:42,72 --> 0:27:44,95
TableTop mission accomplished.


1060
0:27:44,95 --> 0:27:46,4
Thanks lot, you guys, really.


1061
0:27:46,4 --> 0:27:46,49
I mean it.


1062
0:27:46,49 --> 0:27:47,44
Please enjoy.


1063
0:27:47,44 --> 0:27:49,31
You can sit on this couch
as long as you need to.


1064
0:27:49,31 --> 0:27:51,27
I'm going to go downstairs, and
I'm going to talk to Sean


1065
0:27:51,27 --> 0:27:53,72
about the victory that I think
none of us thought we would be


1066
0:27:53,72 --> 0:27:54,657
talking about today.


1067
0:27:54,657 --> 0:27:55,74
JENNA BUSCH: Cool.


1068
0:27:55,74 --> 0:27:55,91
GRANT IMAHARA: All right.


1069
0:27:55,91 --> 0:27:57,752
JENNA BUSCH: I kicked
your ratmen's asses.


1070
0:27:57,752 --> 0:27:59,44
GRANT IMAHARA: Ugh.


1071
0:27:59,44 --> 0:27:59,89
JENNA BUSCH: I did.


1072
0:27:59,89 --> 0:28:0,97
GRANT IMAHARA: Right
in the last round.


1073
0:28:0,97 --> 0:28:3,53
JENNA BUSCH: With my
crazy bitches.


1074
0:28:3,53 --> 0:28:5,19
WIL WHEATON: I don't know
which one of us is more


1075
0:28:5,19 --> 0:28:8,86
surprised that we're both
standing here right now.


1076
0:28:8,86 --> 0:28:9,24
SEAN PLOTT: Yeah.


1077
0:28:9,24 --> 0:28:12,21
Because I was expecting Grant to
just be light years ahead.


1078
0:28:12,21 --> 0:28:12,4
WIL WHEATON: Yeah.


1079
0:28:12,4 --> 0:28:14,3
SEAN PLOTT: And then when the
game ended, I was like, I've


1080
0:28:14,3 --> 0:28:16,74
been such an asshole
all game long.


1081
0:28:16,74 --> 0:28:17,72
Oh, no.


1082
0:28:17,72 --> 0:28:18,86
WIL WHEATON: Not only did
you win the game,


1083
0:28:18,86 --> 0:28:20,66
you also won a ratman.


1084
0:28:20,66 --> 0:28:21,18
SEAN PLOTT: I did?


1085
0:28:21,18 --> 0:28:21,5
Yeah.


1086
0:28:21,5 --> 0:28:23,75
I'm going to of course
get the two earrings.


1087
0:28:23,75 --> 0:28:24,94
Maybe I'll have a third
one so I can get the


1088
0:28:24,94 --> 0:28:25,93
nose piercing as well.


1089
0:28:25,93 --> 0:28:27,26
WIL WHEATON: I think that's
a great idea.


1090
0:28:27,26 --> 0:28:28,52
And when you do that, if
you would just send us


1091
0:28:28,52 --> 0:28:29,24
a picture of it--


1092
0:28:29,24 --> 0:28:30,7
SEAN PLOTT: Yeah.


1093
0:28:30,7 --> 0:28:32,7
WIL WHEATON: --so that we can
put it on the website.


1094
0:28:32,7 --> 0:28:35,5
But listen, you get a real
prize for having


1095
0:28:35,5 --> 0:28:36,77
won today on TableTop.


1096
0:28:36,77 --> 0:28:40,27
We have spared no expense to
bring you this incredible


1097
0:28:40,27 --> 0:28:42,12
TableTop trophy of awesome.


1098
0:28:42,12 --> 0:28:43,31
SEAN PLOTT: Is that real tape?


1099
0:28:43,31 --> 0:28:45,37
WIL WHEATON: It is, in fact,
actual real tape.


1100
0:28:45,37 --> 0:28:49,27
Listen, we do not cut corners
for guys like you.


1101
0:28:49,27 --> 0:28:52,26
So let me just make sure that
everyone knows that this


1102
0:28:52,26 --> 0:28:54,66
belongs to Sean.


1103
0:28:54,66 --> 0:28:56,13
SEAN PLOTT: That is
I. And may I?


1104
0:28:56,13 --> 0:28:56,79
WIL WHEATON: Yes, please do.


1105
0:28:56,79 --> 0:28:58,85
Is there anything you'd like to
say to the folks at home?


1106
0:28:58,85 --> 0:29:1,2
SEAN PLOTT: I would like to
thank everyone who plays


1107
0:29:1,2 --> 0:29:4,45
German-style board games for
understanding the complex


1108
0:29:4,45 --> 0:29:6,85
rules to that game so they can
appreciate this trophy.


1109
0:29:6,85 --> 0:29:9,7
And of course to Jenna, because
without her, she would


1110
0:29:9,7 --> 0:29:12,54
not have appropriately mauled
Grant in the last round.


1111
0:29:12,54 --> 0:29:13,56
WIL WHEATON: Well,
congratulations.


1112
0:29:13,56 --> 0:29:15,22
You absolutely earned
that trophy.


1113
0:29:15,22 --> 0:29:16,52
And now I have to
take it back--


1114
0:29:16,52 --> 0:29:16,91
SEAN PLOTT: Oh.


1115
0:29:16,91 --> 0:29:18,82
WIL WHEATON: --because we don't
have enough budget for


1116
0:29:18,82 --> 0:29:19,47
more than one trophy.


1117
0:29:19,47 --> 0:29:20,9
SEAN PLOTT: May I at least get
a departing handshake?


1118
0:29:20,9 --> 0:29:21,93
WIL WHEATON: Yes, absolutely.


1119
0:29:21,93 --> 0:29:24,88
You can also have a departing
piece of tape--


1120
0:29:24,88 --> 0:29:25,22
SEAN PLOTT: Oh, yeah.


1121
0:29:25,22 --> 0:29:26,24
WIL WHEATON: --with
your name on it.


1122
0:29:26,24 --> 0:29:29,43
So all day long everyone gets to
know that you are Sean, and


1123
0:29:29,43 --> 0:29:30,34
you are a winner.


1124
0:29:30,34 --> 0:29:32,62
SEAN PLOTT: I can't wait to go
to the nearest coffee shop.


1125
0:29:32,62 --> 0:29:33,72
WIL WHEATON: Congratulations.


1126
0:29:33,72 --> 0:29:34,34
SEAN PLOTT: Thank you.


1127
0:29:34,34 --> 0:29:36,45
WIL WHEATON: We will see you
next time on TableTop.


1128
0:29:36,45 --> 0:31:36,45
