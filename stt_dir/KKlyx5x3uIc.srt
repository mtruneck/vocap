1
0:0:3,5 --> 0:0:6,14
So I've done a little work on looking at dealmakers and I wanted


2
0:0:6,14 --> 0:0:9,3
to understand kind of the nature of networking and the new frontiers


3
0:0:9,3 --> 0:0:13,38
that I think are coming between applying network theory and understanding


4
0:0:13,38 --> 0:0:16,32
the structure of social capital and understanding innovation from


5
0:0:16,32 --> 0:0:20,8
the standpoint of how firms ultimately take route.


6
0:0:20,8 --> 0:0:22,76
And I did little work on this and it occurred to me


7
0:0:22,76 --> 0:0:24,64
in the academic literature there was a real clear


8
0:0:24,64 --> 0:0:27,44
distinction between entrepreneurs and investors.


9
0:0:27,44 --> 0:0:29,5
Never understood that distinction because the successful


10
0:0:29,5 --> 0:0:32,15
entrepreneurs I knew were investors, right.


11
0:0:32,15 --> 0:0:35,13
There is no clear bright line between those two.


12
0:0:35,13 --> 0:0:37,12
So I always wondered there was these other people up there


13
0:0:37,12 --> 0:0:39,64
that kind of fuse those two concepts and they tended to


14
0:0:39,64 --> 0:0:42,3
be the people that made more and more things happen.


15
0:0:42,3 --> 0:0:43,46
You might have started as an entrepreneur,


16
0:0:43,46 --> 0:0:47,25
might have started as an investor but you become something else.


17
0:0:47,25 --> 0:0:48,39
I don't know, for the lack of a better word,


18
0:0:48,39 --> 0:0:49,71
I am looking for a better word for those


19
0:0:49,71 --> 0:0:51,93
of you trying to think about this.


20
0:0:51,93 --> 0:0:55,15
The dealmakers, the people that actually make things happen.


21
0:0:55,15 --> 0:0:56,48
And I tried to understand that.


22
0:0:56,48 --> 0:0:57,83
They broker resources,


23
0:0:57,83 --> 0:1:1,2
they shape your networks and they syndicate and interconnect, right.


24
0:1:1,2 --> 0:1:2,92
It occurs to me that there are these people in the


25
0:1:2,92 --> 0:1:6,84
center that activate the rest of the network, when it works, right.


26
0:1:6,84 --> 0:1:9,1
And these are the people that I was starting to get interested in.


27
0:1:9,1 --> 0:1:10,71
I remember about five years ago when the


28
0:1:10,71 --> 0:1:12,78
economy was starting to climb to a halt,


29
0:1:12,78 --> 0:1:16,14
it was grinding to a halt, I wanted to get something going.


30
0:1:16,14 --> 0:1:19,23
And I was thinking to myself who do we need.


31
0:1:19,23 --> 0:1:21,28
We need the people who have done it repeatedly.


32
0:1:21,28 --> 0:1:23,42
We might call them serial entrepreneurs,


33
0:1:23,42 --> 0:1:25,47
you might call them the people who ultimately


34
0:1:25,47 --> 0:1:27,54
broker deals or what have you.


35
0:1:27,54 --> 0:1:30,1
These are the individuals that are going to help us make a heaven.


36
0:1:30,1 --> 0:1:32,38
For some reason, they're frozen. They are not doing it anymore.


37
0:1:32,38 --> 0:1:35,84
Why is that? They're living in kind of a fear.


38
0:1:35,84 --> 0:1:39,92
So I said, let's figure out something, so I developed this algorithm,


39
0:1:39,92 --> 0:1:41,85
I guess, it's for lack of - it's a vaunted


40
0:1:41,85 --> 0:1:42,92
term to call it an algorithm.


41
0:1:42,92 --> 0:1:45,91
The truth of the matter is, I'm looking for people who have multiple


42
0:1:45,91 --> 0:1:49,74
positions in entrepreneurial firms, I'm actually stacking them up,


43
0:1:49,74 --> 0:1:51,99
and then I relate them socially to try to understand


44
0:1:51,99 --> 0:1:53,61
how they're connected to one another.


45
0:1:53,61 --> 0:1:56,78
Because I want you as young entrepreneurs to be able to access them,


46
0:1:56,78 --> 0:1:59,97
right, because that's how you're going to be successful.


47
0:1:59,97 --> 0:2:1,85
So finding out who the who is.


48
0:2:1,85 --> 0:2:4,1
The way I do that is I try to understand the entrepreneurs


49
0:2:4,1 --> 0:2:5,73
and investors and generally there are distinctions


50
0:2:5,73 --> 0:2:6,97
bringing those two types of people.


51
0:2:6,97 --> 0:2:11,27
But as they move up in their career, they have two equity positions,


52
0:2:11,27 --> 0:2:13,96
three equity positions, four equity positions in firms,


53
0:2:13,96 --> 0:2:16,96
they become more and more important in seeing


54
0:2:16,96 --> 0:2:19,42
the network kind of come to life, right.


55
0:2:19,42 --> 0:2:21,2
So I'm looking at actors within firms,


56
0:2:21,2 --> 0:2:24,9
within regions using interlocks, very interested in this.


57
0:2:24,9 --> 0:2:27,88
It occurred to me, I looked at all the tech hotspots and


58
0:2:27,88 --> 0:2:30,63
back in the '80s we actually had a whole set of theories


59
0:2:30,63 --> 0:2:32,72
where if we brought all the technologies together,


60
0:2:32,72 --> 0:2:34,66
entrepreneurship would happen, right.


61
0:2:34,66 --> 0:2:37,47
And this is a chart that shows the number of firms born


62
0:2:37,47 --> 0:2:39,82
and it was fascinating to me that when I looked at it,


63
0:2:39,82 --> 0:2:41,76
Silicon Valley created almost 5,000


64
0:2:41,76 --> 0:2:44,47
firms over a 20 year period whereas Boston created about


65
0:2:44,47 --> 0:2:47,43
half that even though in most cases you're equating Silicon


66
0:2:47,43 --> 0:2:51,5
Valley and Boston as equal parties in entrepreneurship.


67
0:2:51,5 --> 0:2:53,29
All these other technology regions including my region,


68
0:2:53,29 --> 0:2:57,32
Research Triangle Park, created less than 1,000, right.


69
0:2:57,32 --> 0:2:59,73
Ironically where I come from Research Triangle Park has the highest


70
0:2:59,73 --> 0:3:4,1
density of PhDs over total employees of anywhere in the world.


71
0:3:4,1 --> 0:3:5,98
Yet, they're not creating that many companies.


72
0:3:5,98 --> 0:3:8,65
So I was trying to figure that out.


73
0:3:8,65 --> 0:3:10,31
When I looked at these patterns,


74
0:3:10,31 --> 0:3:11,71
these are the number of equity positions


75
0:3:11,71 --> 0:3:15,77
held and you see the numbers on the left, 1 all the way to 30,


76
0:3:15,77 --> 0:3:17,99
these are the equity positions by each of these regions.


77
0:3:17,99 --> 0:3:20,9
And I noticed there was a big fat base


78
0:3:20,9 --> 0:3:22,62
wherever there was nice economies,


79
0:3:22,62 --> 0:3:24,35
where Silicon Valley was performing


80
0:3:24,35 --> 0:3:26,6
so well in creating great companies,


81
0:3:26,6 --> 0:3:28,42
had a lot of entrepreneurs and investors engaged in it.


82
0:3:28,42 --> 0:3:30,33
Okay, we already kind of knew that,


83
0:3:30,33 --> 0:3:32,31
but the other pattern I saw on the data that I thought was really


84
0:3:32,31 --> 0:3:35,34
interesting was there was a really nice fat long tail.


85
0:3:35,34 --> 0:3:38,93
There were a lot of people who did a lot of things, right.


86
0:3:38,93 --> 0:3:42,9
Whereas these other regions you never saw those people, right.


87
0:3:42,9 --> 0:3:46,48
So I started to look at the relationship of dealmakers to the


88
0:3:46,48 --> 0:3:49,74
performance of regions by way of creating new companies.


89
0:3:49,74 --> 0:3:52,3
And I founded as a matter of fact,


90
0:3:52,3 --> 0:3:55,96
statistically the presence of dealmakers was actually


91
0:3:55,96 --> 0:4:0,19
more correlated to firm birth than the frequency of


92
0:4:0,19 --> 0:4:2,62
the availability of entrepreneurs and investors.


93
0:4:2,62 --> 0:4:6,72
So what does it tell you? It occurs to me, that these people are


94
0:4:6,72 --> 0:4:9,66
usually in the elite, the top 2.7%,


95
0:4:9,66 --> 0:4:12,65
these are people who have three or more equity


96
0:4:12,65 --> 0:4:14,73
positions in entrepreneurial firms.


97
0:4:14,73 --> 0:4:17,829
And in places like the Bay Area, it's 4.5%


98
0:4:17,829 --> 0:4:20,5
of the population, whereas places like Austin,


99
0:4:20,5 --> 0:4:24,22
Texas or Denver, it's around 1%, right.


100
0:4:24,22 --> 0:4:27,25
So something is in the water here, right.


101
0:4:27,25 --> 0:4:28,63
It occurs to me, these are the people.


102
0:4:28,63 --> 0:4:30,5
Well I wanted to map the networks and these are


103
0:4:30,5 --> 0:4:32,73
the networks of these 12 technology hotspots,


104
0:4:32,73 --> 0:4:35,42
as a matter of fact they're organized by population,


105
0:4:35,42 --> 0:4:38,63
so the most populous is Boston, the least populous is Austin,


106
0:4:38,63 --> 0:4:39,69
the lower right hand side.


107
0:4:39,69 --> 0:4:41,59
If it varied by population,


108
0:4:41,59 --> 0:4:44,95
you would expect to see the most dense to the least dense, correct?


109
0:4:44,95 --> 0:4:47,87
What do you see in the pattern of this data?


110
0:4:47,87 --> 0:4:52,48
You see the most dense or the most intense


111
0:4:52,48 --> 0:4:54,62
entrepreneurial network in Silicon Valley.


112
0:4:54,62 --> 0:4:57,22
The third greatest - largest metropolitan area up here


113
0:4:57,22 --> 0:4:59,3
Phoenix has the weakest entrepreneurial network.


114
0:4:59,3 --> 0:5:1,0
I was talking to Michael Crow,


115
0:5:1,0 --> 0:5:2,53
the Chancellor of Arizona State University,


116
0:5:2,53 --> 0:5:4,8
shown this data, and he said Zoller, how many people are up there?


117
0:5:4,8 --> 0:5:9,4
And I said about 150 and he said, I'll just have them over the house.


118
0:5:9,4 --> 0:5:11,19
I want to talk to these guys.


119
0:5:11,19 --> 0:5:14,61
Well, in places like RTP or Austin or places like that,


120
0:5:14,61 --> 0:5:17,88
they hang in there even though they're small places.


121
0:5:17,88 --> 0:5:19,7
Please, question?


122
0:5:19,7 --> 0:5:24,36
Okay, the data comes ultimately from private transaction data.


123
0:5:24,36 --> 0:5:28,8
It comes from public databases, like Standard & Poor's.


124
0:5:28,8 --> 0:5:31,34
And I came up with the software to actually put all


125
0:5:31,34 --> 0:5:34,98
the data together and then socially relate it.


126
0:5:34,98 --> 0:5:36,63
Well, what was fascinating is,


127
0:5:36,63 --> 0:5:39,1
this is the aggregate network of entrepreneurs


128
0:5:39,1 --> 0:5:40,58
in each of these regions. What does that tell you?


129
0:5:40,58 --> 0:5:43,23
What two regions other than Silicon Valley and Boston would you


130
0:5:43,23 --> 0:5:47,6
say are starting to look like hot entrepreneurial networks?


131
0:5:47,6 --> 0:5:49,14
San Diego. San Diego and Seattle, right.


132
0:5:49,14 --> 0:5:52,4
Now I'm leaving out some obvious cities because


133
0:5:52,4 --> 0:5:54,31
these are technology hotspots, right?


134
0:5:54,31 --> 0:5:56,73
Leaving out some of the key metropolitan areas


135
0:5:56,73 --> 0:6:0,79
like Los Angeles or New York or Chicago, starting to study those.


136
0:6:0,79 --> 0:6:2,79
What's ironic is many of those cities because they're


137
0:6:2,79 --> 0:6:5,5
financial headquarters tend not to be entrepreneurial.


138
0:6:5,5 --> 0:6:8,17
But you know the stories that are evolving.


139
0:6:8,17 --> 0:6:10,3
The Groupon founders are really driving an


140
0:6:10,3 --> 0:6:12,35
entrepreneurial revolution in Chicago.


141
0:6:12,35 --> 0:6:15,3
Have you all noticed what's happening in New York lately,


142
0:6:15,3 --> 0:6:17,24
across the bridge in Brooklyn?


143
0:6:17,24 --> 0:6:18,67
It's unbelievable, there's an entrepreneurial


144
0:6:18,67 --> 0:6:20,8
revolution going on there.


145
0:6:20,8 --> 0:6:22,34
But the aggregate networks are just one story.


146
0:6:22,34 --> 0:6:25,45
I want to know where the dealmakers are? Well, check this out.


147
0:6:25,45 --> 0:6:27,15
When you screen the aggregate network


148
0:6:27,15 --> 0:6:31,43
for three or more equity positions, this is the picture you get.


149
0:6:31,43 --> 0:6:33,35
Silicon Valley, you would still need the Stanford


150
0:6:33,35 --> 0:6:35,89
Football Stadium to have everybody there, right.


151
0:6:35,89 --> 0:6:39,22
Boston, you could probably fit them in the Stanford Basketball Arena.


152
0:6:39,22 --> 0:6:43,67
Whereas in Austin, you could probably get them in this room, right.


153
0:6:43,67 --> 0:6:45,6
In Phoenix, you could probably get them in


154
0:6:45,6 --> 0:6:47,83
the classroom we're going next, right.


155
0:6:47,83 --> 0:6:50,91
When you go to four plus dealmakers look at this.


156
0:6:50,91 --> 0:6:53,0
You would still need the basketball stadium


157
0:6:53,0 --> 0:6:55,53
here in time for Silicon Valley,


158
0:6:55,53 --> 0:6:58,3
whereas in Boston you could probably get them in this room.


159
0:6:58,3 --> 0:6:59,11
And the people in Phoenix,


160
0:6:59,11 --> 0:7:1,61
you could probably get them in the front row,


161
0:7:1,61 --> 0:7:3,29
pretty interesting, isn't it?


162
0:7:3,29 --> 0:7:5,94
Things aren't all equal when we are looking


163
0:7:5,94 --> 0:9:5,94
at the performance of regions.
