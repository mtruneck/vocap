1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,946



2
0:0:0,946 --> 0:0:5,23
ED HARDY: I know it would be
hard to imagine what it's like


3
0:0:5,23 --> 0:0:7,54
to be around this racket
so many fucking years.


4
0:0:7,54 --> 0:0:10,72
Because I always have to check
myself when I make statements


5
0:0:10,72 --> 0:0:14,8
or assumptions, like am I
predicating this on the way


6
0:0:14,8 --> 0:0:18,7
things were 30 or 50
or more years ago?


7
0:0:18,7 --> 0:0:18,89
It becomes overwhelming.


8
0:0:18,89 --> 0:0:24,26
I go to the conventions and it's
insane, the quality level


9
0:0:24,26 --> 0:0:27,52
and the intelligence of
a lot of the people.


10
0:0:27,52 --> 0:0:30,16
And it's just so phenomenal--


11
0:0:30,16 --> 0:0:31,79
it just took off.


12
0:0:31,79 --> 0:0:40,376



13
0:0:40,376 --> 0:0:43,79
NICK BUBASH: Thom deVita, what
set him apart was that he was


14
0:0:43,79 --> 0:0:47,38
doing tattoos, because nobody
else was doing tattoos.


15
0:0:47,38 --> 0:0:49,355
ED HARDY: Of course it was
completely underground.


16
0:0:49,355 --> 0:0:51,9
And if anybody said anything,
you said we're going to see


17
0:0:51,9 --> 0:0:53,86
The Tattoo Man.


18
0:0:53,86 --> 0:0:56,4
He was so thoroughly integrated
in being a denizen


19
0:0:56,4 --> 0:0:57,5
in Manhattan.


20
0:0:57,5 --> 0:1:0,67
NICK BUBASH: Thom was reflecting
his environment


21
0:1:0,67 --> 0:1:2,767
through his tattoos.


22
0:1:2,767 --> 0:1:5,252
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Were
you known for your designs?


23
0:1:5,252 --> 0:1:13,398
THOM DEVITA: No, I was known
for $30 tattoos.


24
0:1:13,398 --> 0:1:16,19
VALERIE VARGAS: I was heavily
into comic books and stuff


25
0:1:16,19 --> 0:1:17,58
when I was younger, so
there was a lot of


26
0:1:17,58 --> 0:1:18,8
that kind of influence.


27
0:1:18,8 --> 0:1:22,21
If somebody asked me for a woman
or a figure, I'd just go


28
0:1:22,21 --> 0:1:23,215
crazy with it.


29
0:1:23,215 --> 0:1:26,4
STEWART ROBSON: Valerie can
characterize a mood and a


30
0:1:26,4 --> 0:1:27,69
feeling in a tattoo.


31
0:1:27,69 --> 0:1:28,76
She understands that stuff.


32
0:1:28,76 --> 0:1:31,1
I think she understood
that stuff before


33
0:1:31,1 --> 0:1:32,18
she understood tattooing.


34
0:1:32,18 --> 0:1:33,96
DANTE DIMASSA: I hadn't
planned on


35
0:1:33,96 --> 0:1:35,24
giving Valerie a job.


36
0:1:35,24 --> 0:1:38,146
It was almost by mistake,
to be quite honest.


37
0:1:38,146 --> 0:1:40,475
STEWART ROBSON: She can tattoo
circles around most of the


38
0:1:40,475 --> 0:1:42,56
tattooers that work
around her.


39
0:1:42,56 --> 0:1:43,875
Now everyone knows
Valerie Vargas.


40
0:1:43,875 --> 0:1:48,96



41
0:1:48,96 --> 0:2:6,22
MUTSUO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]


42
0:2:6,22 --> 0:2:26,425
MASA: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]


43
0:2:26,425 --> 0:2:30,25
ED HARDY: We never dreamed that
it would get like this.


44
0:2:30,25 --> 0:2:33,27
In terms of just art, like the
imagery and tattooers working


45
0:2:33,27 --> 0:2:34,4
on stuff that doesn't


46
0:2:34,4 --> 0:2:36,95
necessarily have to be tattooed.


47
0:2:36,95 --> 0:2:38,33
And I don't know anything
else in the world that


48
0:2:38,33 --> 0:2:39,58
happened like that.


49
0:2:39,58 --> 0:4:39,58
