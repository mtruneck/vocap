###6 If things don't work out on this planet...
###8 Or if our itch to explore becomes unbearable at some point in the future...
###31 Astronomers have recently found out what kind of galactic real estate might be available
###37 to us.
###42 We'll have to develop advanced transport to land there, 20 light years away.... But that's
###49 for later.
###50 The question right now: is it worth the trip? The destination is a star that you can't see
###58 with your naked eye, in the southern constellation Libra, called Gliese 581.
###68 Identified over 40 years ago by the German astronomer Wilhelm Gliese, it's a red dwarf
###74 with 31% of the Sun's mass... and only 1.3% of its luminosity.
###83 Until recently, the so-called M Stars like Gliese 581 flew below the radar of planet
###90 hunters.
###91 They give off so little energy that a planet would have to orbit dangerously close just
###97 to get enough heat.
###102 Now, these unlikely realms are beginning to show some promise... as their dim light yields
###108 to precision technologies...
###110 ...as well as supercomputers... honed in the battle to understand global changes on this
###117 planet... Earth.
###123 Will we now begin to detect signs of alien life?
###126 Or will these worlds, and the galaxy itself, turn out to be lifeless... and Earth, just
###134 a beautiful, lonely aberration?
###138 To some, like astronomer and author Carl Sagan, the sheer number and diversity of stars makes
###145 it, as he said, "far more likely that the universe is brimming over with life."
###151 This so-called "many worlds" view can be traced back to ancient observers... in China, India,
###159 Greece and Egypt. The Qur'an, the Talmud, and many Hindu texts all imagined a universe
###167 full of living beings.
###170 In the 16th Century, this view got a boost from astronomer and mathematician Nikolas
###175 Copernicus... who came to believe that Earth is not the center of the universe, but revolves
###182 around the Sun.
###184 Seven decades after Copernicus, Galileo Galilei used his newly developed telescope to show
###190 that our Sun was just one among countless other stars in the universe.
###196 By the modern era, the "many worlds" view held sway in scientific circles. A variety
###203 of thinkers considered what and who inhabited worlds beyond our own.
###209 From Martians desperate to get off their planet... to alien invaders intent on launching pre-emptive
###217 strikes against ours... or simple life forms on an evolutionary track to complexity.
###230 But other thinkers have been struck by a different view.
###234 The Greek philosophers Aristotle and Ptolemy believed that humans and Earth are unique.
###241 With the spread of Christianity, this Ptolemaic system became widely accepted.
###249 The latest variation on this theme is what's called the "Rare Earth" hypothesis. It holds
###256 that Earth and sophisticated life were the result of fortuitous circumstances that may
###261 not be easy to find again in our galaxy.
###267 Does the current search for planets shed light on this debate... sending it in one direction
###273 or the other?
###274 So far, our only good reference for recognizing an Earth-like planet is... Earth.
###281 It does have some fortuitous characteristics... it's dense, it's rocky - with a complex make-up
###290 of minerals and organic compounds - and it has lots and lots of water.
###302 It's also got a nearly circular orbit around the Sun, at a distance that allows liquid
###307 water to flow... not too close and not too far away, in the so-called "Habitable Zone."
###317 That's defined as the range of distance from a parent star that a planet would need to
###322 maintain surface temperatures between the freezing and boiling points of water.
###328 Of course, that depends on the size of the planet, the make-up of its atmosphere, and
###333 a host of other factors.
###337 And whether the parent star is large; medium like the Sun; or small.
###345 Some scientists also believe we live in a "Galactic Habitable Zone." We're close enough
###353 to the galactic center to be infused with heavy elements generated by countless stellar
###357 explosions over the eons...
###359 But far enough away from deadly gamma radiation that roars out of the center.
###367 If there is a galactic habitable zone... it's thought to lie 26,000 light years from the
###373 center... about where we are... give or take about 6,000 light years.
###379 According to one estimate, only about 5% of the stars in our galaxy fall within it.
###386 But even out here - in the galactic suburbs  - there are hazards. Some researchers have
###394 linked mass extinctions in the past to the Sun's passage through one of the spiral arms,
###400 where other sources of dangerous gamma radiation lie in wait.
###408 Somehow, though, we've made it through asteroid impacts, climate changes, solar eruptions
###418 and everything else the galaxy has thrown at us.
###422 Now we want to know... are there kindred spirits, somewhere out there, to share our survival
###432 stories with?
###436 This image shows the single biggest obstacle faced by planet hunters. We're looking at
###442 Earth, as photographed by the Voyager spacecraft, from a distance of 3.7 billion miles.
###449 Our mighty world occupies only about one tenth of one pixel.
###456 Try seeing something this small at hundreds of thousands of times that distance.
###461 And try seeing it through the bright glare of a star.
###466 Faced with these obstacles, astronomers have developed ways to see them indirectly.
###472 Since 1995, Swiss and American teams have discovered over 400 planets by looking for
###479 subtle shifts in the motion of their parent stars.
###483 Here's what they'd see if they used this technique  ...
###485 ...to monitor our Sun for a period of 30 years beginning in 1990.
###490 The sun would wobble, or dance about, due to the gravitational tug of planets orbiting
###497 it.
###499 The technique for detecting this wobble is so exquisitely developed that astronomers
###505 can see movements down to a meter per second: human walking speed.
###511 But there's still a ways to go... Earth causes our Sun to move at less than a tenth that
###517 speed.
###518 By analyzing the complexity of this movement...
###521 They have been able to tease out the sizes and distances of the different planets tugging
###526 on the star.
###529 Initially, they detected huge gas giants, many of which have wildly elliptical orbits
###535 that bring them in close to their stars before driving them way out.
###540 Unfortunately, the giant's gravity would eventually fling smaller Earth-sized planets out of the
###547 solar system.
###548 An exception is the star 55 Cancri, where astronomers detected a Jupiter-sized planet
###554 with a nearly circular orbit.
###557 That's a good sign. Our Jupiter is thought to have afforded Earth some protection by
###565 scooping up destructive asteroids.
###567 Beyond occupying a desirable location in the Habitable Zone of its parent star... it helps
###575 if a planet has the right chemistry.
###578 Our Earth and solar system were likely born within a crowded scene... like the Trifid
###584 nebula here... lashed by winds from hot giant stars... and blasted by a violent explosion:
###590 a supernova.
###595 Nuclear burning within the core of large stars is where most of the heavy elements - from
###600 iron and oxygen, to carbon and calcium - are generated. As our Sun formed at the center
###608 of an immense dusty disk, these elements became concentrated in planets.
###617 Some of the most important elements in the search for life have now been detected, because
###621 of the chance alignment of Earth and a solar system 63 light years away that astronomers
###627 refer to as HD 189733.
###629 The Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes together caught a planet whipping around this star
###638 every two Earth days.
###640 This is one sizzling planet... with surface temperatures up around 900 degrees Celsius.
###648 The planet, tagged HD 189733-B, is so hot that a vapor trail follows in its wake. Starlight
###658 passing through this trail allowed scientists to detect carbon dioxide, methane gas... and
###665 water in its atmosphere.
###669 Then there's the sun-like star HD 209458, visible with binoculars, 150 light years away.
###678 It has a planet, known as a "hot Jupiter."
###682 It's hot because it's close-in: as near as 7 million kilometers from the star... Compared
###689 to our planet Mercury, 46 million kilometers out from our Sun...or the Earth, 146 million.
###700 Scientists estimate that stellar winds are blowing some 10,000 tons of material every
###705 second off the surface of this hot gas giant. How long before it gets reduced to a shriveled
###712 core?
###713 That's just what happened to the star called CoRot-7. Astronomers spotted a planet slightly
###719 larger than Earth... and just about as dense. But because little CoRoT-7b is so close to
###725 its parent star, it's most likely covered in molten lava.
###728 If these planets are too close to their stars to harbor life... many of the others discovered
###735 so far are too far away and too large.
###739 Like the one orbiting a star the ancient Arabs called Fomulhaut - - meaning: "the mouth of
###745 the fish." It's just 25 light years away and was the first "exoplanet" to be seen directly.
###754 Using Hubble, scientists blocked out Fomulhaut's glare and found a planet orbiting about 10
###759 times farther out than Saturn. It would take 872 Earth years to make just one orbit.
###768 The brightness of this planet suggests that it's huge and probably surrounded by a dusty
###774 disk.
###774 Astronomers are seeing hints of the diversity of worlds imagined by the ancients... but
###782 still only scant evidence of anything resembling Earth.
###787 Still, there's one class of stars that had, until recently, been overlooked.
###793 The M-stars are the most numerous in our galaxy... around 76% of the total.
###799 They are often called failed stars... because not enough mass fell together as they were
###805 forming to fuel the intense nuclear fusion that burns in stars like our sun.
###810 To be in the "Life Zone" of one of these dwarf stars, a planet would have to be very close.
###820 Unfortunately, because these small stars spin quickly when they're young, they are like
###826 electrical dynamos, with intense magnetic fields that generate dangerous flares.
###831 If a planet manages to survive these flares, it may have to endure another handicap.
###837 In close like this, it's likely to become gravitationally locked to its parent star
###843  - just like our Moon is to Earth - with only one side ever facing the star.
###848 One side scorched... the other frozen. Is there any hope?
###859 On Earth, we know that the unevenness of solar heating, due to the day/night cycle, leads
###867 to oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns that redistribute the heat and equalize temperatures.
###874 A computer simulation performed by NASA scientists showed that a tidally locked planet could,
###880 in fact, develop circulation patterns like this.
###884 In the computer model, a cloud cover developed on the light side: keeping temperatures down
###891 and air pressures high. The result: winds that circled the planet, redistributing enough
###897 heat to keep the rate of freezing down.
###901 That's one reason these M stars are on planet hunters' radars these days.
###908 Another reason is that planet hunting has taken a leap forward.
###911 At the European Southern Observatory in the mountains of Chile, an instrument that specializes
###915 in looking for solar wobbles has come on line. HARPS - short for "High Accuracy Radial Velocity
###922 Planet Searcher" - has been on a planet finding tear.
###925 At a recent conference, scientists announced 30 new planets discovered with this instrument.
###934 Among its most promising targets...
###937 Gliese 581, that inconspicuous red dwarf in Libra.
###943 Four planets have been detected so far...
###947 Planet E is the lightest exoplanet discovered to date, at 1.9 times the mass of Earth.
###953 But it's so close to its parent star that its orbit takes only 3.15 days.
###959 It's likely a larger version of Mercury, scorched by its sun and riddled with craters.
###961 Planet B is close too, and weighs 16 times what Earth does.
###967 Planet C, at 5 Earth masses, lies just inside the Habitable Zone...
###973 ... while Planet D, at 7 Earth masses, lies on its outside edge.
###979 To find out what direction these planets might have taken, scientists have sought to model
###984 their early evolution.
###987 Planet C, on the inside margins of the life zone, would have immediately been subjected
###992 to a withering barrage of solar radiation.
###995 Think Venus. Any water vapor in the atmosphere would have been stripped away. Gases spewed
###1001 out by volcanic activity would have turned the atmosphere increasingly dense...
###1005 A strong greenhouse effect would then have turned Planet C into a hothouse world.
###1014 Planet D is different.
###1016 Earth-bound instruments showed that its gravitational pull is surprisingly weak - meaning it's not
###1021 very dense. That suggests that it might have migrated in from the outer solar system, carrying
###1028 with it significant amounts of hydrogen and oxygen.
###1031 It could be a water world, with an abundance of vapor in the atmosphere that would strengthen
###1038 its greenhouse effect.
###1041 Of course, there are still many unknowns. Is it far enough out to avoid becoming tidally
###1047 locked? If it is locked, has it developed circulation patterns strong enough to keep
###1052 the freezing down on the dark side and support a habitable climate?
###1056 And does it have a magnetic field that protects it against flares that may be bursting from
###1057 its star?
###1057 And is oxygen present in its atmosphere -  one of the most prominent markers of life?
###1058 Astronomers will continue to study the planets of Gliese 581 in the years to come... as part
###1063 of a rapidly expanding list of targets.
###1068 The next era in planet hunting is now ramping up with the recent launch of the Kepler planet-hunting
###1076 spacecraft.
###1081 Kepler amounts to a huge digital camera in space, pointed at a region containing more
###1086 than 100,000 stars...
###1090 Its designers are betting that some of those stars have planets...and that a fraction are
###1095 tilted so that their planets pass between their stars and Kepler's camera.
###1101 If so, astronomers will detect subtle dips in the brightness of these stars - by as little
###1107 as one one-hundredth of a percent. That's the signature of a planet passing in front.
###1113 Another project is breaking new ground by combining data from several ground-based telescopes.
###1120 Astronomers recently used them to probe a star called 61 Virginis, 28 light years away.
###1128 It's nearly identical in mass and age to the Sun. What's more, it was here that astronomers
###1134 found the first Earth-like planets around a Sun-like star, at 5 and 7.5 times the mass
###1141 of Earth.
###1141 A simulation of the atmosphere of the larger one - picturing its flow of heat on a global
###1149 scale - shows how much we can understand, even at this distance. How long before a truly
###1156 Earth-like planet is discovered?
###1160 As astronomers' instruments get better - and their techniques more refined - it's likely
###1167 that they'll discover smaller and smaller planets.
###1176 For now, though, the "Rare-Earth" hypothesis may well have the edge over "Many Worlds."
###1182 The conditions that nurture a habitable planet seem hard to come by... such as position in
###1190 the "life zone"; a nearly circular orbit; and magnetic fields.
###1195 The threats are many, solar flares... marauding giant planets... tidal locking... and other
###1206 lurking catastrophes.
###1211 In fact, Nature has handed us a paradox: Medium-sized stars like our Sun turn out to be particularly
###1220 hostile to life. They emit barrages of ultraviolet radiation... and solar outbursts powerful
###1228 enough to ruin a fledgling atmosphere.
###1231 And yet, somehow, we manage.
###1236 So if it turns out that the Milky Way is filled with habitable worlds... its not that the
###1246 galactic real estate is so special... it's that life finds a way.
