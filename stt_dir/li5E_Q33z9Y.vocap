###0 
###0 CODEX: So we faced off against a rival guild.
###2 It came down to me and their leader, Fawkes.
###3 I kicked his butt, we met up for drinks, and then-- heh--
###8 oh boy.
###9 I never win anything, and I've certainly
###11 never done stuff like--
###12 that, on the first date, so I blame the heat of victory.
###16 Stupid confidence.
###17 Stupid cute gamer boy.
###19 [SIGHS]
###20 I gotta come clean with the guild.
###21 Better to be up front about this than be discovered.
###23 That would be so "after school special." I mean, what if Vork
###27 caught us emoting in-game, or Clara spotted
###30 us out at the movies?
###31 We'd be at a foreign one, with subtitles, and then we'd go
###34 out and eat something exotic afterwards, like, oysters, or
###37 prosciutto.
###38 Whatever that is.
###39 Anyway, I'm gonna tell the guild.
###40 I'm gonna do it-- just get it done.
###42 Yes.
###43 Mm.
###44 [THEME MUSIC]
###64 CLARA (SINGING): Enchant a fish and make a wish, the
###66 Festival of The Sea--
###68 TINKERBALLA: Clara.
###69 Stop singing along with the MPC's.
###71 CLARA: Oh come on, Tink-- this is my
###72 favorite in-game holiday.
###74 All the Mermaid quests and pirates--
###76 I can't wait to get my character that
###77 epic coconut bra.
###79 BLADEZZ: I get enough pirate crap here at work.
###81 Can we run a dungeon or something that doesn't make me
###83 want to spit in a burger again?
###84 VORK: Before we embark on the adorable seasonal [INAUDIBLE]
###89 pet quest, I have a proposal.
###90 CODEX: You guys?
###91 Hey?
###91 Um, it's Codex.
###93 I just wanted to say--
###94 ZABOO: I'm gonna name our sea horse Drowny.
###96 Ironic'ed.
###96 CODEX: But Vork--
###98 I need to let you guys know that, um, there's--
###100 [POWER FAILS]
###101 But--
###103 Was that a sign?
###104 [ALARM SOUND]
###106 ZABOO: That-that's my mom's ring tone.
###108 Why is she calling?
###109 Why now?
###109 She hasn't called in weeks, dude.
###111 Don't call, don't call-- stop-- stop,stop--
###114 uh-- uh--
###117 VORK: Are you done now?
###118 ZABOO: Ahh--
###120 ah.
###120 Yeah, I'm done.
###122 CODEX: Back.
###122 As I was saying--
###123 VORK: I have decided that The Knights of Good should have a
###125 custom guild hall.
###127 CODEX: --or you go first.
###128 CLARA: What?
###128 A custom guild hall?
###130 Cool.
###131 What's that?
###131 ZABOO: Don't you read the patch notes?
###133 CLARA: Never.
###134 VORK: The new expansion has added clear design
###135 housing to the game.
###137 My hope is that a communal guild area will help repair
###139 the emotional scars from our near recent breakup.
###142 In addition, I want one.
###145 TINKERBALLA: Vork.
###145 Those things are expensive and pointless.
###147 Totally e-peen strokers.
###149 BLADEZZ: You guys know how I feel about e-peen stroking.
###151 JEANETTE: Hey, idiot.
###152 I can't serve a charcoal briquette.
###154 Remake it.
###155 And get off that computer, or I'm telling Ollie.
###157 BLADEZZ: Who won't do anything.
###159 The boss loves me.
###161 You, on the other hand--
###162 [SMASH]
###163 Watch the face!
###165 
###167 ZABOO: If we're going to get a guild hall, we need to get the
###167 biggest and baddest one.
###168 TINKERBALLA: The deluxe castle model's half a million gold.
###171 VORK: Precisely.
###171 And we have-- ?
###174 ZABOO: 20,000 in the bank.
###175 CLARA: Half a million?
###176 And we have 20,000?
###177 That's like--
###178 oh, yeah.
###179 There's a difference.
###180 CODEX: I, uh, I heard that the Axis of Anarchy is saving for
###183 a Deluxe one, too.
###184 Huh, which reminds me--
###186 TINKERBALLA: Those D-bags are getting one?
###188 That's it.
###188 I'm in.
###189 BLADEZZ: Yeah.
###189 Screw those guys.
###190 That dude Bruiser is still dating my mom.
###193 Get this.
###193 He took her on a wine tour through Napa, like she's fancy
###197 or something.
###197 TINKERBALLA: Yeah, and Fawkes made the lewdest comments
###199 about you, Codex.
###200 CODEX: Really?
###201 He did?
###202 ZABOO: That's unacceptable.
###203 VORK: He's reprehensible.
###204 CLARA: I'm hungry.
###205 CODEX: I'm dating him.
###206 
###210 ZABOO: Ahhh!
###211 
###215 CODEX: Zaboo?
###215 VORK: What is with you today?
###217 TINKERBALLA: You're dating Fawkes?
###218 He almost ripped apart the guild.
###220 BLADEZZ: Actually, you started it.
###221 TINKERBALLA: I will dent your face.
###223 CODEX: We've only had one date.
###224 And it was after the LAN party.
###225 I am not a traitor.
###227 CLARA: Enemies become lovers?
###228 Oh my god.
###229 This is like the soap opera I used to watch.
###231 Maybe you have an evil twin, and he's secretly a NASCAR
###234 driver slash surgeon.
###236 VORK: I am not putting my mouth to your mouth.
###238 [COUGHING]
###238 ZABOO: What?
###239 Codex is dating Fawkes?
###240 What the heck happened?
###241 Why did I disconnect those surveillance cameras?
###244 CLARA: On second thought?
###245 Maybe he's a bull fighter, and you're in the witness
###247 protection program.
###248 BLADEZZ: You're banging him, and their Guild healer is
###251 banging my mom.
###252 That's guild incest.
###253 CODEX: No, wait a second-- wait wait wait wait wait--
###254 I have never done anything like this before, and, and and
###257 there were some unique circumstances.
###258 Remember, I--
###259 I had won something--
###260 TINKERBALLA: Wait.
###261 So you did bang him?
###263 I never pegged you for a ho-bag--
###265 ZABOO: Wait--
###266 you what?
###267 CLARA: Whoa--
###267 you boffed him after only one date?
###269 Achievement unlocked.
###271 BLADEZZ: Wait-- did you boff him or bang him?
###273 Get the story straight here, and with details.
###275 CODEX: It's not--
###277 Guys?
###277 We are dating.
###278 We are in a relationship.
###280 So if stuff happened, then it's private.
###283 CLARA: Not anymore.
###285 CODEX: I know he seemed like a jerk, but, um, he's different.
###289 We might be good together.
###290 I just want to see where this goes.
###291 TINKERBALLA: It's going nowhere.
###292 He's an anarchist.
###294 There's no way he's gonna date you.
###296 CODEX: That's not true.
###297 He--
###298 he left his jacket here.
###300 CLARA: He left something?
###301 Classic move.
###302 It's like when a dog pees on a fire hydrant.
###304 He's totally into you.
###305 VORK: Codex, we're discussing building a guild hall.
###307 This is seriously distracting.
###309 CODEX: I was upfront about everything.
###311 Can't I get props for that?
###312 UNISON: No.
###313 [ELECTRICAL SIZZLE]
###315 CODEX: Oh--
###316 
###318 oh, oh oh--
###320 Now who's judging me?
###321 
###325 CODEX: I hope this thing works.
###326 I was in middle of arguing with the Guild, and my
###328 computer just-- pow!
###330 This bedroom feels like a crime scene now.
###333 For more than one reason.
###334 Telling the Guild about Fawkes was the right thing to do.
###337 I just wish they hadn't jumped to all the right conclusions.
###340 They're so mad at me.
###341 I texted everyone.
###343 Help-- computer broke.
###344 Sad face.
###344 And Bladezz was the first one to respond.
###347 He's coming over with some spare pity parts he had lying
###349 around, see if he can fix the thing.
###350 He needs to hurry.
###352 I know they're talking about me--
###353 I can feel it.
###354 Did I mention I can't get online right now?
###357 [PHONE RINGS]
###358 FAWKES: Damn it, Venom-- why don't you just cut off my dick
###360 and tell me it's a popsicle?
###362 [CELLPHONE RING]
###364 Raiding.
###365 CODEX: Hi.
###366 It's Codex.
###367 I've been having some computer problems, so if you see me
###370 offline, I--
###371 I didn't want you to think I was avoiding you or anything.
###373 FAWKES: To think that would be pathetically neurotic.
###376 CODEX: Oh.
###377 So--
###378 I haven't talked to you since our date the other night.
###380 I don't normally drink, but I had a really good time.
###383 FAWKES: As did I. I believe my favorite part of the evening
###386 was after the second margarita, when you said, come
###388 back to my place and take my armor off.
###390 CODEX: Wow.
###392 Drunk me is really forward.
###394 FAWKES: It's nothing to be ashamed of.
###395 The sexual act is one of our basic animal instincts.
###398 CODEX: Well, I shy away from my base instincts and try hard
###401 to be really classy.
###402 Like Audrey Hepburn?
###403 FAWKES: At a certain point in the evening, you farted on me.
###406 In order to make me taco-flavored.
###408 It was cute.
###409 CODEX: Moving on.
###410 Tonight, I was thinking that, uh--
###414 I have your jacket.
###414 FAWKES: Bring it to 521 Spring Street at 8:00 PM.
###417 CODEX: OK, it's a date.
###419 Oh.
###419 You hung up.
###420 [KNOCKING]
###422 BLADEZZ: I heard you let the bad boys in.
###425 CODEX: Thanks for coming over.
###425 Is the Guild still talking about me?
###427 Fix my computer.
###428 Hurry--
###429 BLADEZZ: OK.
###429 OK.
###430 But just so you know, I told the boss that I had a family
###432 thing come up.
###433 So if anyone asks, you're my cousin who had boob surgery.
###438 CODEX: Eh--
###438 OK.
###438 The computer's right there.
###440 BLADEZZ: Oh.
###441 On the bed and waiting for me.
###443 Roar.
###443 CODEX: Do you have to make everything
###445 into a sexual innuendo?
###446 BLADEZZ: I'd like to in your endo.
###448 CODEX: Ugh.
###449 God, you're awful.
###450 CLARA: Who would've thought that last holy bolt Codex
###452 shoved up Fawkes' butt at the LAN party would've goosed them
###455 into a relationship?
###457 So romantic.
###458 TINKERBALLA: Reality check.
###459 There will be no relationship.
###461 Be prepared for her depressed voice.
###463 Also known as normal voice.
###464 ZABOO: I don't understand women.
###465 Codex is dating a jerk, my one and girlfriend Riley locked me
###468 in a clothes dryer, and then my ma--
###472 and then my ma-- ther--
###474 m-- mother--
###475 see, I can't even say it--
###476 TINKERBALLA: It's not your fault you're a social retard
###478 with girls.
###478 ZABOO: It's not?
###479 TINKERBALLA: My Psych 101 class, which I went to once,
###481 says it all starts with the parents.
###483 CLARA: Parents influence their kids?
###484 What is that, a new study?
###486 ZABOO: But you're women.
###487 And I'm totally normal with you dudes.
###488 TINKERBALLA: Normal?
###489 CLARA: Because we're your friends.
###490 Just treat Codex like you would treat us.
###493 Because, let's face it-- you and Codex?
###495 TINKERBALLA: Not gonna happen.
###497 ZABOO: Yeah.
###497 You're right.
###498 I need to let go of that, and focus on being her friend.
###500 100%.
###501 No.
###501 110%.
###502 Even though the math is weird on that.
###504 I'm gonna be her best friend ever.
###506 So--
###507 how do I do that?
###508 TINKERBALLA: When did this guild go from playing a game
###510 together to talking about feelings and holding each
###512 other's vaginas?
###514 ZABOO: Do you guys really do that?
###515 
###518 BLADEZZ: There's gross lady dander all in this thing.
###521 CODEX: I didn't know you needed to vacuum in there.
###523 Who tells you that?
###525 Did you fix it?
###525 BLADEZZ: You're better off buying a new computer.
###527 CODEX: I can't buy a new computer.
###529 I'm poor.
###529 My credit cards are maxed.
###531 I survive on Ramen, that's why my skin's so dry, and--
###534 ew, I'm sharing so much personal stuff today.
###536 Where'd you get all these parts, anyway?
###538 BLADEZZ: Oh, the, uh, public library computer.
###540 CODEX: What?
###540 BLADEZZ: You're a part of the public.
###542 OK.
###542 Here we go.
###545 [COMPUTER FIRES UP]
###548 CODEX: I love that sound.
###549 Move over.
###549 [THUD]
###549 I have to log on.
###550 I can feel them talking about me.
###552 I have to defend myself.
###553 VORK: The aesthetics are irrelevant.
###554 We're building a guild hall, not a banjo factory.
###558 CODEX: Oh.
###559 So self-centered.
###560 What's going on?
###561 ZABOO: Welcome back, best friend Codex my friendy friend
###563 frienderson.
###564 We're just discussing design options for the guild hall.
###566 TINKERBALLA: We need someone with a vision.
###567 And I am that person.
###569 Check out my color pallate.
###571 ZABOO: Whoa.
###572 BLADEZZ: OK, that looks like a preschooler's sock drawer.
###575 Let me design it.
###576 Can we buy a slave girl on PCs?
###578 ZABOO: I think we should let Codex do it.
###580 To show that we as a collective are fine with
###582 whatever personal decisions she makes in her life.
###586 CLARA: Vork--
###586 I'm gonna fax you my design.
###588 I used every single crayon color.
###589 TINKERBALLA: Hold up, chickie.
###590 Who made you lead designer?
###591 CLARA: But I want the turret model--
###593 TINKERBALLA: I want the turret model.
###594 CLARA: I want the formal gardens add-on--
###595 TINKERBALLA: So do I. With the gazebo?
###597 CLARA: And magenta walls?
###598 TINKERBALLA: Yes-- with the eggshell trim.
###600 CLARA: Did you borrow my crayon set?
###602 And my mind?
###603 VORK: A gazebo painted in #FF33CC?
###606 No.
###607 The primary function should be defensibility.
###609 Or you use the austere.
###611 #33333 stone.
###613 #FF33CC would make an extremely eye catching target
###616 for an aerial dragon assault.
###618 CODEX: That feature doesn't even exist in the game.
###619 VORK: There could be future additional
###621 downloadable content.
###622 BLADEZZ: OK, look.
###623 If it's defensible you want, then the blood fountain is an
###625 immediate in.
###626 TINKERBALLA: No one wants to hang out in a hair band video.
###628 CODEX: Why don't we compromise on a design that
###630 everyone can enjoy?
###631 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###632 That's not fair--
###632 Great idea, long-time companion.
###633 No--
###633 BLADEZZ: What are you, stupid?
###635 CODEX: But the whole point of building a guild hall was to
###637 bring us together.
###638 We shouldn't let this turn into a competition.
###640 VORK: I agree, Codex.
###640 The only fair way to settle this would be to give design
###643 rights to whoever earns the most gold.
###645 CODEX: Vork, that's the very definition of a competition.
###646 VORK: Fundraising shall commence--
###648 now.
###648 CLARA: Oh--
###649 BLADEZZ: No fair.
###650 I have to go back to work.
###652 CODEX: I can't start till tomorrow.
###654 I have to get ready for my date.
###656 I want to find a really good quote to open with.
###657 ZABOO: So you're definitely going out with Fawkes again.
###659 I'm excited for you.
###659 Because friends support friends.
###663 Oh, man, this is going to be tough.
###665 CODEX: "And one by one the nights between our separated
###668 cities are joined." One by one the nights between our
###672 separated--
###673 VENOM: Jacket.
###674 Now!
###675 
###679 Nice dress.
###681 Go die in it.
###682 
###689 CODEX: Last night was a miscommunication, that's all.
###691 When I was on the phone with Fawkes yesterday, I'm pretty
###694 sure I heard rock sound effects in the background.
###695 Which meant he was ready to give Venom her sentence, which
###697 is super intense on the leadership side.
###698 Plus, I just dance around things too much.
###700 I should have just come out and said, Do you want to get
###703 together tonight for a date?
###705 Sure, part of me is, like, Is he the jerk I
###707 thought he was before?
###708 Or is that just a facade, hiding the really cool dude
###710 who made me feel pretty, and awesome, and who I impulsively
###713 went way too far with?
###715 I'll just wait for him to call me.
###716 Or I could text him.
###717 Email?
###717 In-game mail?
###718 IM?
###718 That's a weird sound.
###719 
###722 ZABOO: Man, you are set.
###724 Man.
###724 Bladezz used some chinky parts in here.
###726 I think some of it was from an ATM.
###728 CODEX: Thanks for looking at it.
###730 ZABOO: No problemo.
###731 I hope that I'm not, like, parachuting into Fawkes
###732 territory or anything.
###734 I know this is, like, boyfriendville.
###736 CODEX: Uh--
###736 no, it's, it's early, so I didn't want to bother him.
###739 ZABOO: Look at how far we've come, huh?
###741 From star-crossed lovers to inseparable BFFs.
###744 Roller coastered.
###745 CODEX: Ah, I wouldn't describe it either of
###747 those ways, but thanks.
###748 ZABOO: And-- heh heh--
###749 in support of your budding romance, I had this painting
###753 commissioned for you, best friend.
###755 Voila'd.
###758 Yeah.
###758 I know.
###759 I was speechless, too.
###760 This friend of mine who does van art whipped it
###762 right up for me.
###763 The likenesses are pretty special.
###765 And, potentially, could end up on the side of a van.
###768 CODEX: Yeah, it is special.
###769 Thank you.
###770 ZABOO: I know the Guild's been giving you a ton of flak for
###771 dating this guy.
###772 But I'm in support.
###774 Put me on Team Codex Fawkes.
###775 Team Cawkes.
###776 Thinking about making T-shirts.
###778 CODEX: Uh, no.
###779 We should play.
###779 ZABOO: Oh, yeah, let's play, for sure.
###781 [RINGTONE SOUND]
###782 Oo--
###783 Voice mail.
###784 Ah--
###785 it's my mom again.
###786 She's being so creepy.
###787 Listen.
###788 ZABOO'S MOM: Hello, Sujan.
###789 It's my birthday soon, and for me the best present would be
###793 just to hear the sound of your voice.
###795 Goodbye.
###796 ZABOO: She's insane.
###798 CODEX: It sounded OK to me.
###799 ZABOO: OK?
###801 You met my mom.
###801 You know that OK would never be used to describe her.
###804 Ever.
###804 CODEX: Look.
###805 Sometimes people change.
###806 They might've been jerks, but then something happens, and
###809 you find out they aren't jerks anymore.
###810 So if something else happens that makes you suspicious that
###813 they really are the jerks that you thought they were, you
###815 should really give them the benefit of the doubt, and--
###817 and wait for them to call you.
###819 ZABOO: Are we still talking about me?
###820 CODEX: What?
###820 ZABOO: Huh?
###821 CODEX: Yes.
###822 Yes.
###822 You should give your mom a chance.
###824 ZABOO: OK.
###825 All right, you're right.
###826 Wow.
###827 This is really great.
###829 I love being in a friend zone.
###830 I never knew women could be such great pals.
###833 CLARA: Vork is a loser, Vork is a loser.
###836 CODEX: Sometimes.
###837 Why the hateful chanting?
###838 VORK: My iron ingots are not selling in the trading house.
###841 I've only made 2,000 gold so far towards the guild hall.
###843 CLARA: And Tink and I teamed up to clean up.
###845 Up to 5,000 gold already.
###847 TINKERBALLA: With Clara's tailoring and my enchanting,
###849 we're making sets of uber fishing gloves.
###851 They're selling like hotcakes 'cause of all the Sea Festival
###853 quests this week.
###854 CLARA: We also have a bit worked out.
###856 We invite the guy to a private chat channel called Fishy
###858 Lips, and then Tink goes--
###860 TINKERBALLA: --you want these gloves--
###861 CLARA: -- then I go, You need these gloves, and then really
###864 quick we say--
###865 TINKERBALLA: Want.
###866 CLARA: Need.
###867 TINKERBALLA: Want.
###868 CLARA: Need.
###868 TINKERBALLA: 50 gold.
###869 Pay up.
###869 CLARA: We sell a pair, every time.
###871 ZABOO: Oo.
###871 Lady voiced.
###872 I'll buy three pairs.
###873 TINKERBALLA: Later.
###874 Clara--
###874 customer.
###876 CLARA: Oh--
###877 VORK: Can I turn them in for auditory prostitution?
###879 ZABOO: For selling fish gloves?
###880 Seems kind of drastic, dude.
###881 VORK: I can't let them win.
###883 I need a defensible guild hall, not a
###885 glitter infested, puff--
###887 puffy paint palace.
###888 And where's Bladezz?
###889 CODEX: He has a job.
###890 He's at Cheesybeards.
###891 VORK: Maybe he and I can team up.
###893 I do need someone with a work ethic.
###894 
###902 OLLIE: Oh-- that's quite a heave ho in that left arm.
###906 Good toss, lad.
###908 JEANETTE: That's it?
###909 You chewed my ass off last week for
###911 serving wilted lettuce.
###912 OLLIE: Oo--
###913 don't mutiny, Jeanette.
###915 Or I'll make you walk the plank.
###916 
###920 BLADEZZ: Order up, Jeanette.
###921 [DING]
###923 CODEX: No, Zaboo, I don't want to talk about what Fawkes
###925 smells like.
###926 ZABOO: I bet it's like a combination
###927 of nutmeg and rawhide.
###930 CODEX: He's not a gingerbread cowboy.
###932 CLARA: We're back.
###933 15 more sets of gloves sold.
###935 VORK: Aneurysm.
###936 CODEX: What--
###937 what is going on with my computer?
###939 My character's leaping around the screen like a
###940 crack-filled ferret.
###941 TINKERBALLA: Why don't you get your new
###942 boyfriend to buy you one?
###944 I can't believe he went out with you again.
###945 CLARA: Oh, that's right.
###946 Codex, how did your date go last night?
###948 ZABOO: Yeah, let's dish.
###949 CODEX: Uh, it's a long story.
###951 Heh-heh.
###951 Um, dating is, it's-- the dating world is complicated,
###955 and sometimes--
###956 [COMPUTER POWERS DOWN]
###957 my computer crashed.
###958 CLARA: Codex, Fawkes is riding by right now with the whole
###960 Axis of Anarchy.
###961 VORK: Probably on their way to purchase a deluxe guild hall
###964 with a sensible color scheme.
###965 CODEX: Don't message him.
###966 Oh-- stupid computer.
###967 ZABOO: I'll just log onto your character from my laptop.
###969 CODEX: Wait, you have my password?
###970 ZABOO: Oh.
###971 Well sometimes I go into your backpack and rearrange all the
###973 items in your inventory.
###974 Inventory Tetris'ed.
###975 CLARA: Slash wave at him.
###977 [ELEPHANT SOUNDS FROM COMPUTER]
###978 
###982 TINKERBALLA: You just got blown off by a
###984 guy riding a mastodon.
###986 CODEX: Maybe he was on auto-follow.
###987 Or he didn't recognize me.
###989 Yeah.
###990 ZABOO: You know, a human red-haired female priest with
###992 an elite herald tunic isn't uncommon.
###995 CLARA: Well, maybe you should--
###996 CODEX: --call him.
###997 You're right.
###997 Because we're dating.
###998 I should be able to do that.
###999 ZABOO: Yeah, you go, girlfriend.
###1000 CODEX: OK.
###1001 ZABOO: Friend girl.
###1002 CLARA: I was gonna say, why don't you just get drunk and
###1004 show up at his doorstep?
###1005 But calling's good, too.
###1006 [TELEPHONE RINGS]
###1008 FAWKES: Journaling.
###1009 CODEX: Hi.
###1010 It's Codex.
###1010 Uh, did you get your jacket?
###1012 FAWKES: I did.
###1013 CODEX: I kind of thought you'd pick it up yourself.
###1015 FAWKES: You can't undo the past.
###1016 But you can certainly not repeat it.
###1018 Bruce Willis.
###1019 CODEX: OK.
###1020 So do you want to set a time now?
###1023 To go out together?
###1024 For-- for a date?
###1025 FAWKES: Yeah, I thought I made this clear between us.
###1027 I don't date.
###1028 CODEX: What?
###1029 No.
###1029 No, that certainly was not clear, because I don't do one
###1032 time deals.
###1034 FAWKES: Well apparently in this case, you did.
###1035 CODEX: Wait, so--
###1036 [CLICK]
###1040 Oh my god.
###1042 I really am a ho-bag?
###1046 CODEX: I'm not a slut.
###1047 I'm not.
###1048 I am a good girl.
###1049 The worst thing I've ever done is sniff a permanent marker.
###1052 But it was only 15 seconds, tops, and the whole time I was
###1054 screaming inside, Stop-- cancer--
###1056 stop.
###1056 What did I misunderstand about that date?
###1059 We got along great.
###1060 Eh, that rhymes.
###1061 But with a little logic, and a mild panic attack, I convinced
###1064 Fawkes to meet me for a non date-
###1065 deductible business meeting.
###1067 I'm gonna figure out what happened, deal with him
###1069 calmly, and then we will go out again.
###1070 We have to.
###1071 A one-time deal?
###1073 What is the guild gonna think?
###1074 I'm their priest.
###1075 I have a virtual reputation to uphold.
###1078 So I just wanted to understand some of the nuances of the
###1081 other night more clearly.
###1082 Heh.
###1082 Um, why are we not going out again, again?
###1085 FAWKES: Codex, you bested me in one-on-one combat in the
###1088 Kinlandia Arena, and for that you have earned my respect.
###1091 However, I have a strict one date only policy.
###1094 CODEX: OK, that part?
###1095 Why?
###1095 FAWKES: I am an epicurean.
###1096 It is my goal in this life to experience all that womankind
###1100 has to offer.
###1101 I sample once, and then I move on.
###1103 CODEX: Yeah, but, but we, we have so much in common.
###1105 FAWKES: Mm.
###1105 Such as?
###1106 CODEX: Well, the game.
###1107 And we both use the Internet to play the
###1109 game, and we both--
###1110 you know what?
###1111 There is definitely something here, or I would never have
###1113 let you plug into my port.
###1114 FAWKES: Well, we had great chemistry.
###1115 That is undeniable--
###1116 CODEX: See?
###1117 That's something.
###1118 I mean, you were talking about how we were all base and
###1120 animally and stuff, and-- wait.
###1122 You're not a furry, are you?
###1123 FAWKES: I haven't gotten to that part of the list yet, no.
###1125 CODEX: OK, so, let's go out again.
###1127 I mean, look at us right now.
###1129 This is, like, so super fun.
###1130 JEANETTE: Honey, don't beg a guy to date you.
###1133 That is just sorry business.
###1135 FAWKES: Out of the mouths of babes.
###1136 JEANETTE: Mm--
###1137 you are yummy.
###1138 
###1141 CODEX: OK.
###1142 You don't want to see me again?
###1143 That's fine.
###1143 I can deal with that.
###1144 But the thing is, I kind of told the guild about us.
###1147 FAWKES: You told your guild about our one night of
###1149 passionate monkey sex?
###1150 CODEX: It kind of came up in conversation.
###1151 So I'm just gonna tell the guild that we're still going
###1154 out for just a little while longer, and I would appreciate
###1156 it if you would cover for me.
###1158 Could you do that for me?
###1159 Please?
###1159 FAWKES: Wow, you've really put a lot of thought into this.
###1161 CODEX: Yes.
###1161 All night last night.
###1162 Obsessively.
###1163 FAWKES: OK, what's in it for me?
###1165 CODEX: I make good brownies.
###1166 BLADEZZ: Hey, our only two customers.
###1168 I wanted to stop by to see what's causing
###1170 all the guild turmoil.
###1172 FAWKES: We're causing turmoil in your guild?
###1173 BLADEZZ: Oh, yeah.
###1174 Tink's having a fit, Zaboo almost had a heart attack--
###1177 FAWKES: Really.
###1179 Mmm--
###1181 mwah.
###1182 Post that on your guild's forum.
###1183 BLADEZZ: Yes, sir.
###1185 
###1187 FAWKES: OK, Codex.
###1188 I'll cover for you.
###1188 CODEX: Thank you.
###1189 Thank you very much.
###1190 FAWKES: I don't want you to feel ashamed about what
###1191 happened between us.
###1192 You are in elite company.
###1194 Last year, at Comic-Con?
###1195 I bedded the creator of the comic
###1197 Circuitra, Robot Princess.
###1199 
###1201 CODEX: Oh--
###1202 I loved that--
###1203 never mind.
###1204 
###1206 VORK: I've notated every single gold
###1207 vein in the game atlas.
###1209 If you camp the lower quadrant--
###1210 ZABOO: Yeah, Vork, I can't help you with
###1212 the guild hall, buddy.
###1213 I am neck-deep in my quest for understanding women.
###1216 And this lady quiz is going to tell my effectiveness as a
###1218 supportive sidekick.
###1218 VORK: No one in the world would find that interesting.
###1220 ZABOO: Question number eight.
###1221 Your best friend's boyfriend broke up with her.
###1222 Do you, A, pamper her with a trip to a relaxing day spa; B,
###1226 take her out for salsa dancing; or C, comfort her
###1229 with a tearjerker movie and ice cream?
###1230 VORK: C.
###1231 ZABOO: Why C?
###1232 VORK: The majority of multiple choice answers are always C.
###1234 In addition, comfort requires emotional commitment, and
###1237 salsa dancing is performed in poor lighting.
###1240 Now get out your pick axe and start a-mining.
###1242 ZABOO: Fine.
###1243 [ALARM SOUNDING]
###1245 Aw, dude--
###1245 it's my mom.
###1246 What should I do?
###1247 VORK: If you're not mining, you're dead to me.
###1249 ZABOO: All right.
###1249 I'm going to answer it.
###1250 I have you on speaker phone--
###1251 I'm not alone.
###1252 ZABOO'S MOM: Sujan?
###1252 It's so nice to hear your voice.
###1255 Did you get the cyber-vite for my birthday?
###1258 ZABOO: Uh, yes, but I'm not gonna make it.
###1260 And I notice that you invited Dad, and he's dead, so he's
###1262 probably not gonna make it, either.
###1263 ZABOO'S MOM: That's all right.
###1264 This call is the best present I could ever have.
###1268 ZABOO: OK.
###1269 Um, is that it?
###1270 ZABOO'S MOM: That's all.
###1271 Good bye.
###1272 
###1275 ZABOO: Wha-- no guilt trips?
###1276 No screaming?
###1277 What's going on?
###1278 I mean, is she being held hostage?
###1279 Is there a ransom?
###1280 I'm not gonna pay it.
###1280 VORK: I said nothing, corpse.
###1282 Carry on.
###1283 ZABOO: Question number nine.
###1285 If your friendship was a food--
###1286 VORK: C.
###1288 ZABOO: C.
###1289 BLADEZZ: He stuck you with the bill, too.
###1291 I have to take lessons from this guy--
###1292 CODEX: Shut up.
###1293 It was a great second date.
###1294 We are so into each other.
###1295 BLADEZZ: Hm.
###1295 CODEX: And I why don't we talk about
###1296 something that's your business?
###1297 Like my computer?
###1298 That you supposedly fixed, that barely works?
###1300 How am I supposed to play?
###1301 BLADEZZ: Oh, OK.
###1302 Give me 50 bucks for a second house call, I'll check it out.
###1305 CODEX: 50 bucks?
###1306 I told you, I'm really poor.
###1307 You're supposed to be my friend.
###1310 BLADEZZ: Jesus, woman, you need to be tranqed.
###1312 CODEX: I'm sorry.
###1313 It's just, I'm so stressed right now.
###1315 I just have to have a computer.
###1317 For the guild hall, for living-- it's, like, so
###1319 important--
###1320 BLADEZZ: OK.
###1321 Don't leak.
###1322 If you need quick dough, Bladezz'll hook you up.
###1325 Go.
###1326 
###1333 OLLIE: So, Sherman.
###1335 Just, um, who are you to Simon here?
###1337 CODEX: Uh, it's complicated--
###1338 BLADEZZ: She's my cousin.
###1339 OLLIE: The one who had boob surgery?
###1340 BLADEZZ: Yeah.
###1341 She made 'em smaller.
###1342 OLLIE: Went too far.
###1343 So, you ever work in food service?
###1345 CODEX: I used to be a musician.
###1346 OLLIE: Musician, eh?
###1347 Well, I used to be semi-professional myself.
###1349 Heh heh heh--
###1351 pirate balladeer.
###1352 (SINGING) So, they whacked me up, they whacked me down, the
###1356 first mate cracked me upon the crown, and then they boogered
###1358 me round and round, when I was just a shaver.
###1361 [LAUGHTER]
###1362 CODEX: That's a lovely baritone.
###1363 OLLIE: Oh, I also sing first tenor.
###1367 Well, I--
###1368 I'd like to throw you a life jacket, lass, but, um, I'm not
###1371 hiring right now.
###1372 No, business is in the bilge.
###1374 BLADEZZ: Aw, come on, boss.
###1375 She's old and reliable looking.
###1377 Can't she swab something?
###1378 CODEX: Well, look-- you have a computer.
###1380 Drool.
###1380 OLLIE: Oh, that.
###1381 Never turn on the blasted contraption.
###1384 CODEX: Wait, you've never turned it on?
###1386 Poor thing.
###1387 Uh, do you need it?
###1388 OLLIE: Oh, aye, yes.
###1390 It-- it serves me well as a paperweight.
###1396 CODEX: Can I stay here and use it?
###1397 To help you?
###1398 With business?
###1399 OLLIE: How?
###1400 CODEX: Uh--
###1401 websites.
###1402 Yes, websites, and, and social networking.
###1404 They can all get people into your restaurant.
###1406 Right?
###1407 OLLIE: You can do that?
###1408 CODEX: Yes.
###1409 OLLIE: Well, slog my jolly boat--
###1411 BLADEZZ: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
###1412 OK, I'm cool with throwing you a bone, but if there's fun,
###1414 white-collar work to be done, I'll be the guy paid to do it.
###1417 OLLIE: Oh, no way, lad.
###1418 Gotta have you where I need you.
###1420 Grub master.
###1421 Below decks.
###1422 BLADEZZ: Bu,bu, but I--I--
###1424 CODEX: Then I will do it.
###1425 I am the lassie for the job.
###1426 OLLIE: Never say old Black Ollie
###1427 didn't parlay with progress.
###1429 You see, I'll give you a split of the booty, if you can crew
###1433 up those tables out there.
###1435 Deal?
###1437 CODEX: Aye, aye, Captain.
###1438 [LAUGHTER]
###1440 OLLIE: Arrgh--
###1441 CODEX: Arrgh--
###1442 Heh heh--
###1443 
###1446 Bladezz got me a job.
###1447 That he's pissed at me for getting, but, whatever.
###1449 A job.
###1450 It's been so long, it feels weird coming out of my mouth.
###1453 Job.
###1454 Job.
###1454 Job.
###1456 OK.
###1456 I'll stop.
###1457 I'm not technically qualified, or getting paid up front--
###1460 which is so like me--
###1461 but I think I can do this.
###1463 Social media can't be that hard.
###1465 Every bozo on the internet claims to be an expert.
###1467 And, I think I worked out the whole Fawkes thing, so by the
###1469 end of week, I will have a brand new computer, and be
###1472 innocuously broken up in a face-saving manner.
###1474 Life is pretty good right now.
###1476 Why did I say that?
###1477 I just totally jinxed it.
###1479 Ohh--
###1481 CLARA: I can't believe you got a job, Codex.
###1483 I'm so jealous.
###1485 Is it glamorous?
###1486 Are you wearing a pencil skirt?
###1487 VORK: The important question is, can I get a discount on
###1489 foodstuffs?
###1490 Namely, discounted to free.
###1491 CODEX: It's a little early to be asking for free stuff.
###1493 I've gotta get paying customers in here first.
###1495 But it is nice to have a working computer again.
###1498 I named her Harriett.
###1499 CLARA: Do people really hate Cheesybeards' food that much?
###1501 I thought their cosmos were good.
###1503 ZABOO: Some of these comments are horrible.
###1504 Leaky disaster.
###1505 Tastes like butt pirate butt.
###1507 VORK: Ahh--
###1508 CODEX: I know.
###1508 And Ollie doesn't even own the domain name.
###1510 I had to get Cheesybeards.info.
###1512 CLARA: You get to buy domain names?
###1514 Ah, you're such a jet-setter now.
###1517 Wah--
###1517 MR. WIGGLY: What's wrong?
###1518 Are you guys-- ?
###1519 Oh.
###1520 I thought it was one of the kids.
###1521 CLARA: Honey, Codex got a job.
###1523 She's working from work and having so much fun right now.
###1525 MR. WIGGLY: You have a job, Bunny.
###1526 It's the most important job of all.
###1529 Being a mom.
###1530 [BLENDER SOUND]
###1533 Gabby?
###1534 CLARA: Meh.
###1536 Oo, Codex--
###1537 I saw that picture of you and Fawkes that Bladezz posted.
###1539 Talk about a two- hander.
###1542 What?
###1543 TINKERBALLA: I don't want that disaster porn on the forums.
###1545 Some of us have sensitive stomachs.
###1547 ZABOO: Don't worry, Codex.
###1547 I'll create a separate forum topic for you to post pictures
###1550 and videos for those of us, you know, who want to
###1551 celebrate your love.
###1553 Also, I've been doing my friend research, and have
###1555 learned how to braid hair in eight different styles.
###1557 Mostly from Hairly Legal magazine.
###1559 CODEX: No, no, no, no, no--
###1559 Tink is right.
###1560 From now on, I'll keep my relationship with Fawkes on
###1563 the down low.
###1564 For the good of the guild.
###1565 No matter how it's going.
###1566 Ooh--
###1566 BLADEZZ: Move.
###1567 I have to keep up with guild hall farming.
###1569 CODEX: Don't be mad at me.
###1570 I can't help it if Ollie gave me a job
###1571 that's better than yours.
###1572 BLADEZZ: Hey, I'm the rogue.
###1573 I'm supposed to do the backstabbing here.
###1575 CODEX: A lot of the bad internet comments are
###1576 specifically about you.
###1578 Horrible food, cooked by sleepy-looking
###1579 feather-haired kid?
###1580 BLADEZZ: They're called layers, hater.
###1583 You guys can weep, but as I'm up to 25K on guild hall
###1586 farming, prepare for bloody axes and iron maidens.
###1589 TINKERBALLA: Correction.
###1590 Fairy and unicorn tapestries.
###1592 Clara, check our numbers.
###1595 CLARA: Tink and I are up 60 K. Eat it--
###1597 VORK: 60 K?
###1598 I've been practicing classic Keynesian economics and I'm
###1601 only up to 27.
###1602 In addition, I haven't left this chair in two days.
###1604 ZABOO: Ah-- that's 'cause he's been pounding energy drinks.
###1607 VORK: That's urine.
###1609 From my penis.
###1610 I can't waste valuable mining time.
###1612 CLARA: We added sexy music to our Fishy Lips chat channel,
###1614 and tell people our real-life names are Darla and Pancake.
###1617 TINKERBALLA: Look forward to filigree out your butthole.
###1619 And Cupid add-ons.
###1621 ZABOO: Ugh--
###1622 rococoed.
###1624 CLARA: Are you still here?
###1626 MR. WIGGLY: Don't be mad, honey.
###1627 You and Tink seem to have a great business online.
###1629 Isn't that enough?
###1630 CLARA: Yeah, but--
###1631 [BREATH]
###1632 Hey.
###1633 What if Tink and I started a real business?
###1635 MR. WIGGLY: What kind of business?
###1636 CLARA: Tink, Wiggly just had a great idea.
###1638 We work so good together, we have to
###1639 start a real business--
###1640 MR. WIGGLY: Uh, I said nothing.
###1642 TINKERBALLA: Like, out of game?
###1643 CLARA: Yeah.
###1643 Making real money.
###1645 TINKERBALLA: I like that word.
###1646 Money.
###1647 BLADEZZ: We know.
###1648 TINKERBALLA: What could we do?
###1649 CLARA: Oh, Wiggly will help us with the stupid details.
###1651 He does this for a living.
###1652 MR. WIGGLY: Honey--
###1653 I'm in pharmaceuticals, on salary, I've never--
###1655 CLARA: Tink, come over.
###1656 He's already making ideas.
###1658 Wiggly will put out a cheese tray.
###1660 TINKERBALLA: Mm.
###1660 As long as you lock up the babies, I'm game.
###1663 CLARA: Wiggly--
###1663 cheese tray.
###1665 CODEX: Looks like I started a real-life leveling trend.
###1666 VORK: Good job, Codex.
###1667 Keep going so I'm the only one unemployed.
###1670 I want that game and all its assets to myself.
###1673 OLLIE: Hard at work in here, aye lass?
###1675 CODEX: Uh, yeah.
###1676 We're working hard.
###1677 Right?
###1678 OLLIE: 'Cause I give no quarter to stowaways.
###1681 [FANFARE]
###1686 [FANFARE]
###1687 ZABOO: Codex is gonna look so slammin' with
###1689 this fishtail braid.
###1690 And then, I texted my mom, Happy Birthday.
###1693 And then she wrote back, Thank you.
###1697 I'm officially a woman whisperer.
###1698 [ALARM]
###1699 Ah--
###1701 VORK: Visitors.
###1702 ZABOO: Oh--
###1703 [ZAP]
###1705 Vork-- no, no, no, don't open the door, do not open the--
###1708 ZABOO'S MOM: Hello.
###1709 I came to celebrate my birthday with my son--
###1712 ZABOO: Mom?
###1713 ZABOO'S MOM: Sujan?
###1714 ZABOO: Hi, mom.
###1715 ZABOO'S MOM: What--
###1716 ZABOO: Press the button when I do that.
###1717 Press the button.
###1718 
###1721 CODEX: I thought it would be cool, being able
###1722 to log on from work.
###1723 But Ollie keeps ambushing me.
###1724 It's making me totally paranoid.
###1727 This webcam's gonna look like a cheap seaside horror film.
###1730 Anyway, I've been doing a lot of web stuff for Cheesybeards,
###1732 and-- what was that noise?
###1733 Ollie is so stealthy for a pirate.
###1734 Why can't he have a peg leg, instead of a,
###1736 a sharp shiny hook?
###1737 And what's the deal with that thing, anyway?
###1739 Is it real, or a costume?
###1740 How do you find out?
###1741 There is just no protocol.
###1742 What came first?
###1743 The pirate, or the hook?
###1744 BLADEZZ: Arrgh--
###1745 CODEX: Oh, oh, oh!
###1746 BLADEZZ: Avast ye, Sherman-- uh-hunh--
###1751 ZABOO: Mom, you can't just show up to my place
###1752 uninvited--
###1753 VORK: Correction.
###1754 My place.
###1754 ZABOO'S MOM: But you make me happy with the texting, Sujan.
###1758 I thought you'd want to celebrate.
###1759 ZABOO: No.
###1760 Oh, god, you are strong.
###1762 Uh-- look, I'm not going home with you, OK?
###1764 I'm here, hanging with my homey, Vork.
###1766 VORK: Don't touch me.
###1768 ZABOO: OK.
###1768 ZABOO'S MOM: Why do you assume such things?
###1769 I just came to invite you to dinner.
###1771 ZABOO: Oh.
###1772 So you can drug me.
###1773 And then stuff me into a trunk.
###1774 Just like when you kidnapped me from science camp.
###1776 They were not gonna clone me.
###1777 ZABOO'S MOM: Let's dwell on the positive.
###1780 Oo--
###1781 this is a pretty fishtail braid.
###1784 ZABOO: Well.
###1785 It is a difficult technique to master.
###1787 ZABOO'S MOM: Uh-huh.
###1787 ZABOO: Lots of ins and outs.
###1789 Stop messing with my mind.

###1800 [BACKGROUND VOICES]
###1804 CODEX: Vork?
###1805 Are you watching a Bollywood film?
###1806 VORK: No.
###1807 It's Zaboo and his mother.
###1808 She arrived uninvited.
###1810 [SPEAKING HINDI]
###1812 ZABOO'S MOM: Oh--
###1813 ZABOO: How many languages do you know, dude?
###1814 VORK: All of them.
###1814 CODEX: What?
###1815 But we downed that boss.
###1816 What does she want?
###1817 CLARA: It's her birthday, and she's there to be friendly,
###1819 and celebrate.
###1821 CODEX: That's a weird respawn.
###1822 MR. WIGGLY: Honey, your, uh, angry agent friend is here.
###1824 CLARA: Oh, Tink's here for a business meeting.
###1826 Wiggly.
###1827 Pretend you're my put upon assistant.
###1829 MR. WIGGLY: I've told you not to call me Wiggly.
###1830 I don't--
###1831 I don't game anymore.
###1832 CLARA: Ah, Wiggly.
###1833 Fetch me some water, boy.
###1836 VORK: Codex, now that we're alone, I want you to join
###1838 forces with me to earn money for the guild hall.
###1840 CODEX: Join forces.
###1841 How?
###1842 VORK: As a healer, I can rent you out to priestless groups.
###1845 CODEX: No.
###1845 No, I'm not letting you pimp me out for your guild hall.
###1848 VORK: Plan B. I can transcribe episodes of Dynasty from my
###1851 VHS collection.
###1852 And we can reenact scenes in a common area, for tips.
###1855 CODEX: Who would pay us for that?
###1856 VORK: The story lines are sordid and compelling.
###1858 People could watch between tournament bouts.
###1860 CODEX: Uh, thanks, sir, but I don't think that's appropriate
###1863 for our organization at this time.
###1865 BLADEZZ: Cleaned out the rat traps, boss.
###1867 Whattya want to do with them?
###1868 Tomorrow's special?
###1869 [LAUGHTER]
###1870 Whoops-- my bad.
###1872 COMPUTER VOICE: Our communal environment is at stake--
###1873 CODEX: Um, sir, we appreciate your passion.
###1875 But a charity project isn't something we can help with, at
###1877 this time--
###1878 VORK: Foreign talkers!
###1880 Please!
###1881 CODEX: Outsourcing.
###1881 We'll get back with you.
###1883 OLLIE: There's an empty galley out there, Sherman.
###1885 Is this project ever gonna put into port?
###1887 CODEX: No, I'm working hard.
###1889 I created a MyFace account, and a Tweeter account--
###1891 BLADEZZ: Caught that, by the way.
###1893 Our burgers are Pira- licious.
###1894 Out of three followers, two unfollowed you, and the third
###1897 just left a comment saying, Gay.
###1899 CODEX: I'm still getting the hang of it.
###1900 BLADEZZ: And a lot of nasty remarks on
###1902 that Yelp review site.
###1903 It is so hard to keep people happy.
###1905 CODEX: If you'll excuse us for a second.
###1906 Hunh-hunh.
###1907 I know you're leaving those nasty comments.
###1909 NotBladezz69?
###1909 Bladezz Duh.
###1911 BLADEZZ: I'm just trying to keep you on your feet while I
###1912 flip burgers in the bung hole.
###1914 CODEX: OK.
###1915 Let's deal.
###1916 What can I do for you, besides quit?
###1920 Don't smile like that.
###1922 
###1931 MR. WIGGLY: So--
###1932 ah, Tink.
###1933 Is that your real name?
###1935 CLARA: Honey-- stop grilling her.
###1936 MR. WIGGLY: Tink, I'm sorry.
###1937 Please.
###1938 Forgive me.
###1939 I didn't mean to be so invasive.
###1940 CLARA: Let's get down to business.
###1942 Can we get a 1-800 number?
###1943 I've just always wanted one.
###1944 1-800 GET CLARA?
###1946 It's just so easy to remember.
###1947 MR. WIGGLY: Well, we might be jumping the gun just a bit.
###1950 First let's figure out, like, what is it that you two want
###1952 to do together?
###1953 CLARA: Something--
###1954 TINKERBALLA: --that makes a ton of money--
###1955 CLARA: --with no effort.
###1956 MR. WIGGLY: OK.
###1956 Yeah, we're gonna have to narrow it
###1957 down just a bit more.
###1959 All right, Clara, you're a mom, and Tink, what
###1961 is it that you do?
###1962 TINKERBALLA: [SIGHS]
###1963 CLARA: Honey.
###1964 MR. WIGGLY: What--
###1964 Tink, I'm sorry, please--
###1966 Tink.
###1967 Stop.
###1968 No more grilling, OK?
###1969 I don't--
###1970 I don't have much to work on here, but, see, you're both
###1972 women, and you game together--
###1975 CLARA: Oh my god, what a great idea.
###1977 Women making real money from gaming.
###1980 TINKERBALLA: I'd be into that.
###1981 MR. WIGGLY: No, that's not really the plan, it's--
###1983 CLARA: I'm gonna go make business cards.
###1984 This is official now.
###1985 
###1988 [LAUGHTER]
###1989 [ARCADE MUSIC]
###1994 OLLIE: Arrgh.
###1995 Dogs with a laser--
###1997 Well that floods my poop deck.
###1998 CODEX: And that's only video, Ollie.
###2000 OLLIE: A commercial for the internet.
###2002 And you know how to do that?
###2003 Without makin' it look like a shipwreck?
###2005 CODEX: It doesn't matter.
###2006 That video has 7,000,000 views.
###2008 Think about all those burgers.
###2010 OLLIE: Aye.
###2011 Aye, good point, lass.
###2013 I might have to franchise.
###2015 Expand the fleet.
###2016 CODEX: Well, let's not get carried away.
###2018 BLADEZZ: And, lucky for you, you have a professional actor
###2023 on this demo reel is a monologue I did from Huck Finn
###2025 that gave my grandmother a stroke.
###2027 Literally.
###2028 OLLIE: I like this idea.
###2030 I like this idea a lot.
###2032 Do it.
###2033 Do it.
###2033 In the meantime, let's watch more dog videos.
###2038 [BARKING FROM COMPUTER]
###2040 [OLLIE'S LAUGHTER]
###2042 ZABOO'S MOM: You're so good at game running, Sujan.
###2045 ZABOO: I'm not paying attention to you.
###2046 VORK: For someone who claimed to have cracked the woman
###2048 code, you're entirely incompetent right now.
###2050 ZABOO: Yeah, you're right.
###2052 Mom?
###2052 I will go to your birthday dinner.
###2054 But, I'm bringing my friends.
###2055 Vork?
###2056 VORK: Who's paying?
###2057 ZABOO'S MOM: Well, it's my birthday, so--
###2059 VORK: Mm.
###2059 ZABOO'S MOM: --of course I'll be paying for it.
###2063 VORK: Let's go.
###2065 CODEX: Hey.
###2065 Finally got the computer back.
###2067 Never show an old person a dog video.
###2068 It's like entering a recursive loop you can never escape.
###2071 ZABOO: Hey, Codex.
###2071 I need you to come to my mom's birthday dinner tonight.
###2073 Gotta have my back, bestie.
###2074 CODEX: Uh, I, uh, I, I have a date.
###2076 With Fawkes.
###2077 Because, you know, we're dating.
###2078 So that's what we're doing.
###2079 We're dating.
###2079 ZABOO: Sweet.
###2080 Bring him right along.
###2080 CODEX: Nuh-- but but but--
###2082 ZABOO: Directions texted.
###2083 CODEX: But, no, no, but--
###2084 ZABOO: See you there.
###2084 CODEX: No--
###2085 Uh--
###2086 God, I'm such a slow thinker.
###2087 
###2090 Hey, everyone.
###2091 Fawkes couldn't make it.
###2092 It's really funny story, hunh, I wrote it down on my hand--
###2095 FAWKES: What's a funny story, kissy face?
###2098 Mwha--
###2101 VORK: More bread, please?
###2104 CODEX: I've never gotten into real time strategy games.
###2106 It's hard enough responding to a turn based scenario, but
###2109 adding a real time element?
###2110 How is that fun?
###2111 I have a hard enough time coping with real
###2113 life in real time.
###2114 Like, if I'd had a pause button, I could have come up
###2116 with an actual good excuse why I couldn't go to dinner, or
###2119 cope better with the fact that Zaboo sent Fawkes the
###2121 restaurant info, and he actually showed up.
###2124 I was speechless.
###2125 I had nothing.
###2126 My resources were totally maxed.
###2128 Let's face it--
###2128 I got zerged.
###2130 
###2132 FAWKES: Mm--
###2132 mwah--
###2133 mwah--
###2134 mwah--
###2134 ZABOO: This does not nauseate me at all.
###2136 FAWKES: I am so glad that I was able to cancel my
###2140 emergency Anarchist's Club meeting downtown.
###2144 CODEX: Thank you, muffin face.
###2146 You really didn't have to do it.
###2148 Really.
###2148 ZABOO: Fawkes-- meet my mom.
###2150 FAWKES: Enchanted.
###2152 You know, with Bruiser dating Bladezz' mom, the mothers of
###2154 The Knights of Good have become epic idols.
###2156 You should all get together and do a swimsuit calendar.
###2159 VORK: My mother's dead.
###2161 Employing her as Miss September would simply be
###2164 inappropriate.
###2165 ZABOO'S MOM: So, Sujan.
###2166 Tell me about your new life.
###2167 Tell me all about it.
###2169 ZABOO: I game.
###2170 And then I game some more.
###2171 ZABOO'S MOM: Oh.
###2172 Wonderful.
###2173 ZABOO: And then I moved out of Codex' place, on a quest to
###2175 become a man.
###2176 ZABOO'S MOM: Your father would be so proud, Sujan.
###2179 ZABOO: Well then Codex threw me over for a total anus faced
###2181 stunt guy, and then I started dating this hardcore bisexual
###2184 FPS gamer chick.
###2185 She took my V-card, and then she started dating this
###2187 paraplegic goth girl, and now I'm staying at Vork's in a
###2190 toddler bed underneath a bunch of pigeons--
###2192 VORK: Squab.
###2192 ZABOO: --squab, trying to understand women.
###2195 FAWKES: It was worth the trip just to hear that.
###2197 VORK: Just to clarify, you're paying for the entire bill?
###2200 ZABOO'S MOM: Yes.
###2200 For the 50th time, yes.
###2204 VORK: Happy birthday to me.
###2205 
###2208 BLADEZZ: Ladies?
###2209 Start drafting your press releases on
###2211 how you knew me when.
###2212 Codex is filming a Cheesybeards commercial
###2214 tomorrow, starring moi.
###2216 I'm gonna have to film a sex tape after this, to capitalize
###2218 on my fame.
###2219 TINKERBALLA: Now I have to go bleach my brain.
###2220 CLARA: Tell him about our company, Tink.
###2222 TINKERBALLA: Bladezz?
###2222 Pass.
###2223 CLARA: We wanted to make money off of gaming, and we thought
###2225 of a niche no one was serving.
###2227 Tees for pregnant gamers.
###2228 Say hello to Pregamers.
###2231 TINKERBALLA: Pre-Gamers.
###2232 CLARA: Pregamers.
###2233 TINKERBALLA: Pre-Gamers.
###2235 CLARA: Preg-amers?
###2235 TINKERBALLA: Let's work on that name later.
###2236 CLARA: We even have a bunch of slogans already.
###2238 Newb On Board.
###2239 Mini Boss.
###2240 Don't Frag My Baby.
###2241 That one was Tink's.
###2243 Women of all ages will want one.
###2244 BLADEZZ: All ages?
###2245 Give me one for Dena.
###2246 Her middle school teachers are going to flip.
###2249 Where are you selling them?
###2250 CLARA: We haven't worked out the worky icky parts yet.
###2252 TINKERBALLA: Oh, I can't wait to design the logo.
###2254 Some 8-bit baby with a machine gun.
###2256 [KNOCKING]
###2257 BLADEZZ: Oh, dudes, my acting coach is here.
###2259 We need to run some facial expressions
###2260 in the mirror tonight.
###2261 This time we're doing number six--
###2263 Nick Cage, puzzled.
###2265 
###2270 DENA: Terrible.
###2270 I can't believe I'm missing my bocce ball
###2272 tournament for this.
###2273 CLARA: Tink, we need more t-shirt models.
###2275 Oo-- text Codex and tell her to get the unprotected nasty
###2277 on tonight.

###2280 CODEX: Tink.
###2280 What the eff?
###2281 VORK: The pork tenderloins--
###2282 do they freeze well, or do I need to vacuum seal them?
###2285 WAITER: I don't know.
###2286 VORK: Then I'll only have seven of them.
###2288 
###2292 ZABOO'S MOM: Well, it is my birthday, so I do have one
###2296 small request.
###2297 ZABOO: I knew there was a catch.
###2298 ZABOO'S MOM: I've been going to these meetings at AA.
###2300 ZABOO: Mom--
###2301 when did you start drinking?
###2302 ZABOO'S MOM: I haven't been drinking.
###2303 But co-dependents anonymous is full of very whiny people.
###2307 So, as a step in my process, I have to go through each one of
###2311 the things that I did, and apologize for them.
###2314 FAWKES: Well that's very interesting.
###2316 ZABOO: I really appreciate that, Mom.
###2317 Hey-- a toast.
###2319 To new beginnings.
###2320 Ha.
###2320 Starting--
###2320 ZABOO'S MOM: To begin with, I took you to
###2323 modeling class, remember?
###2324 I forced you to go to it, though your runway walk was
###2327 quite jaunty, I must say.
###2329 ZABOO: Ha ha ha, yeah--
###2329 ZABOO'S MOM: I apologize for that.
###2331 FAWKES: We're learning all sorts of exciting things about
###2333 you today, aren't we?
###2334 ZABOO'S MOM: And then, at your bris--
###2336 FAWKES: Excuse me.
###2337 Isn't a bris a Jewish tradition?
###2339 ZABOO: Yeah, we're Hin-Jews.
###2340 So anyway, yeah--
###2341 ZABOO'S MOM: We had it when he was 10 years old, and invited
###2344 his entire modeling class.
###2346 I apologize for that.
###2347 ZABOO: No, you know what, it's fine--
###2349 FAWKES: You are a market researcher's wet dream.
###2352 Please, continue.
###2353 ZABOO: Dude.
###2353 Inappro, OK?
###2354 CODEX: Yeah.
###2355 Yeah, sweet face, that is quite enough of you.
###2357 FAWKES: I'm sorry, honey bunny.
###2359 Am I making everyone upset?
###2361 VORK: I'm not upset.
###2362 FAWKES: Really.
###2362 How's the construction of your guild hall coming?
###2365 The Axis just bought ours.
###2367 Deluxe.
###2368 VORK: Sasafrass!
###2369 CODEX: Honey?
###2370 Come help me in the kitchen.
###2371 FAWKES: What?
###2372 CODEX: Whatever.
###2373 Come on.
###2375 FAWKES: Excuse us.
###2378 DENA: Mel Gibson, scared!
###2381 John Malkovich, happy!
###2382 Go!
###2383 Go--
###2384 BLADEZZ: My eyelid is starting to twitch!
###2385 DENA: Robert Pattinson, ecstasy!
###2388 Pathetic.
###2388 You call yourself an actor?
###2391 BLADEZZ: [WHIMPERS]
###2393 ZABOO'S MOM: And I am so sorry I made you practice all the
###2396 opera singing at the mall food court--
###2398 ZABOO: Apology accepted for everything.
###2399 Please, just-- don't cut my meat.
###2401 C'mon, I can do this--
###2401 VORK: Why would you not want your meat cut into amenable
###2403 bite-sized portions?
###2406 Thank you.
###2407 I'm still in shock that the Axis of Anarchy has already
###2410 purchased their guild hall.
###2411 ZABOO'S MOM: Are you purchasing
###2412 real estate, Mr. Vork?
###2413 Because that is my specialty.
###2415 VORK: I've been buying and selling in-game products, but
###2417 the profit margins are too thin.
###2418 ZABOO'S MOM: Why not make your fortunes in
###2420 the commodities market?
###2421 VORK: The game doesn't have anything like that.
###2423 ZABOO'S MOM: Can you create one?
###2425 VORK: Well, I don't--
###2427 Wait a second.
###2429 You may be of value to me.
###2430 I'm shocked.
###2431 
###2434 CODEX: What are you doing here?
###2436 I shouldn't have to be dealing with anyone but pretend you.
###2438 That was the deal.
###2439 FAWKES: Well, I've never had the experience of being a
###2441 boyfriend before, so I thought this would be a good
###2443 no-strings opportunity.
###2445 CODEX: I thought you only did stuff with
###2446 a girl once, remember?
###2447 FAWKES: Ah, but tonight, I am role playing myself.
###2450 CODEX: That is such BS.
###2452 Admit it.
###2453 This is a second date.
###2454 You like me.
###2455 FAWKES: I--
###2458 is there a fainting couch in the ladies' room?
###2460 CODEX: A what?
###2461 FAWKES: Since I'm role playing myself, if you were to role
###2463 play yourself?
###2464 Then it would be the first time for role playing us to do
###2467 it on a fainting couch.
###2469 CODEX: OK.
###2469 Thanks for playing along, but, as of tomorrow, I'm telling
###2472 the guild that we are officially broken up.
###2474 FAWKES: You're breaking off the fake relationship with the
###2478 pretend me.
###2479 Hm.
###2480 This is indeed a meta meta moment.
###2483 CODEX: I guess.
###2484 It was barely fun while it didn't last.
###2486 FAWKES: Ah--
###2487 
###2496 It's just a little reminder of what you're passing up.
###2499 
###2504 CODEX: Is there a breeze in here?
###2507 One of the most common types of romance novels is about the
###2510 reformed rake--
###2511 a devilish man whore who sleeps with anything that
###2513 moves, until he meets the one right girl who makes him hang
###2515 up his man parts to settle down for a
###2517 long, one-lady life.
###2519 She usually ends up pregnant in the epilogue.
###2521 Thank God I called it off with Fawkes before that.
###2523 Now, I just have to make up a good story to tell the guild
###2525 about our equitable parting, and I can close the book on
###2528 the whole thing.
###2529 Meanwhile, I'm filming that commercial with Bladezz
###2531 tonight, so I have to learn how to make
###2532 a film in 11 hours.
###2534 I just looked at my wrist, and I'm not wearing a watch.
###2537 So dumb.
###2541 Yeah, pregnant gamer tees are a great idea.
###2543 I don't know why people wouldn't be into them.
###2545 CLARA: We went to, like, four game stores wearing
###2546 prototypes, and people thought we were a reality show prank.
###2549 TINKERBALLA: Except one guy, who wanted us to pose for his
###2551 weird fetish website.
###2553 CODEX: Dare I ask?
###2554 CLARA: MakingItWithBabymakers.com.
###2555 
###2557 Nice website.
###2559 TINKERBALLA: Hey, what's up with Vork?
###2560 He created a password-protected channel,
###2562 and he's been in there with strangers all day.
###2564 CODEX: Vork Torgothian Average channel?
###2566 [STOCK EXCHANGE SOUNDS]
###2567 VORK: What do you advise about war weed?
###2569 ZABOO'S MOM: Invest.
###2569 VORK: I need warweed--
###2570 50 gold-- need warweed at 50 gold.
###2572 ZABOO'S MOM: But sell silver.
###2573 I believe player Gankmaster is planning on
###2575 flooding the market.
###2576 He's a miner, correct?
###2577 VORK: Correct.
###2577 Got silver for 100 gold-- got silver for 100 gold.
###2581 I have to say, Mrs. Zaboo--
###2582 ZABOO'S MOM: Avinashi.
###2583 VORK: I'll never remember that.
###2584 This is brilliant.
###2586 By creating a derivatives market of the Torgothian
###2587 economy, we've added an intriguing new level of
###2589 gameplay that'll net me a tidy sum with each trade.
###2592 ZABOO: That sounds complicated.
###2593 And scammy.
###2594 VORK: It's a free market at work.
###2595 Your mother's a brilliant woman.
###2596 ZABOO'S MOM: Oh, it's my pleasure to help in
###2598 any way, Mr. Vork.
###2599 Gherkins?
###2600 VORK: Hold on a minute, woman.
###2601 I don't know where your fingers have been.
###2603 
###2607 Mm.
###2608 Tolerable.
###2610 ZABOO: What's up, ladies?
###2611 CODEX: Oh, nothing.
###2611 Just trying to learn filmmaking in 24 hours.
###2615 ZABOO: Things are going awesome here.
###2616 My mom is so focused on Vork, that she's
###2617 totally ignoring me.
###2619 Ma--
###2620 gherkin.
###2620 Eee-eee-eee.
###2620 Eee-eee-eee.
###2622 Man, she always feeds me when I dolphinize.
###2623 This is great.
###2625 I really want a gherkin now, though.
###2627 OK.
###2629 Man, life is perfect.
###2630 CLARA: Zaboo, your mom and Vork hooked up?
###2632 What's in the water lately?
###2633 ZABOO: No, no.
###2634 Never that.
###2635 They're working together on the guild hall.
###2636 See, Vork's got this awesome plan laid out-- mmm--
###2638 VORK: What happens in shed, stays in shed.
###2640 CLARA: I'm not worried.
###2641 We're up to 300 K in savings.
###2643 VORK: What?
###2643 But you've been offline all day.
###2645 How will you keep up the pace of your earnings potential?
###2647 CLARA: Well, Tink and I have a secret weapon.
###2649 Blake and Gabby, keep collecting
###2651 cotton for Auntie Tink.
###2652 Kill the monsters.
###2653 BLAKE: Kill the monsters!
###2654 TINKERBALLA: Boys are stupid.
###2655 GABBY: Boys are stupid.
###2657 TINKERBALLA: These kids are growing on me.
###2659 CLARA: The Sea Festival's almost over, but by that time
###2661 Tink and me will be serving tea to the guild in a bitchin'
###2664 fairy palace.
###2666 VORK: I was visualizing custom gargoyles with my face
###2669 superimposed.
###2670 But that dream is slipping from my grasp.
###2671 ZABOO'S MOM: Oh, keep trading.
###2673 The plan will work.
###2674 VORK: Mrs. Zaboo, I don't--
###2675 [INDIAN MUSIC]
###2675 oooh--
###2676 ZABOO'S MOM: Do not resist, Mr. Vork.
###2678 You are deserving of pampering.
###2680 I cleaned out your kitchen earlier.
###2683 I threw out many expired large cans of food.
###2687 VORK: You what?
###2688 Keep your hands off my chow!
###2692 [DOOR SLAMS]
###2693 [RINGTONE]
###2696 TINKERBALLA: Oh my God.
###2697 Venom just sent me a picture of Fawkes with some chick in a
###2700 giant panda suit.
###2702 "Check out Fawkes' date last night."
###2705 CLARA: Aww, how creepy.
###2706 TINKERBALLA: That's so gross.
###2708 Wait.
###2709 Last night?
###2710 CLARA: What?
###2711 What a man skeeve.
###2712 That jerk-face is cheating on Codex?
###2714 TINKERBALLA: She wishes.
###2717 So, Codex.
###2718 How's everything going with Fawkes?
###2719 CODEX: Um, sad news.
###2721 Uh, we decided to break it off.
###2723 This morning.
###2724 Over brunch.
###2725 Prosciutto omelets, to be precise.
###2726 ZABOO: What, really?
###2728 CODEX: Yeah.
###2728 It was a mutual decision.
###2729 Let's not talk about it any more--
###2730 TINKERBALLA: Codex-- you're a total liar!
###2732 CODEX: What are you talking about?
###2732 Why?
###2733 TINKERBALLA: Venom just texted me and told me that Fawkes has
###2735 been going out with girls all week.
###2736 You guys were never dating.
###2737 You were just a one night stand.
###2741 ZABOO: Oh, that almost made me poop a little.
###2742 Uh-- it's back in.
###2743 Turtle headed.
###2744 CLARA: Codex, you're so wiley.
###2745 Like that coyote, what's-his- thingy.
###2747 CODEX: OK.
###2747 Fine, Tink, you're right.
###2749 I was lying the whole time.
###2750 I am a ho diddy ho bag.
###2752 But I only did it because I--
###2754 I cared about what you guys think about me.
###2756 And now you've made me feel worse than I already did
###2758 before, so thanks a lot.
###2760 I'm gonna go home and--
###2761 just eat a lot of calories.
###2764 TINKERBALLA: I hate it when I'm right.
###2766 Wait.
###2766 No I don't.
###2767 ZABOO: Tink, schadenfreuded.
###2768 CLARA: Gesundheit.
###2769 VORK: I was able to run down the garbage truck, but I could
###2772 salvage no green beans.
###2773 This is a disaster!
###2774 ZABOO: Vork--
###2775 Codex was lying about her and Fawkes the whole time.
###2777 And I--
###2778 I don't feel happy about it.
###2780 I just feel bad for Codex.
###2783 I'm a good friend!
###2784 Yes!
###2784 Whoo-hoo!
###2785 VORK: Very supportive.
###2787 ZABOO: Get these shoulders ready.
###2788 'Cause she's gonna cry on 'em.
###2789 Here I come, Codex!
###2790 VORK: Go get them.
###2792 And you.
###2793 Expiration dates are mere suggestions.
###2795 Like late fees, and traffic lights.
###2798 CODEX: If I think too hard about what's going on right
###2800 now, I might be a little creeped out.
###2802 But I actually appreciate you coming over.
###2804 ZABOO: No problem.
###2806 God.
###2806 This mask is tightening up all over my face.
###2809 Man, I'd never put this on another part of my body.
###2811 Well, maybe.
###2812 CODEX: Why did I think lying to the guild was a good idea?
###2815 Why did I hook up with that guy at all?
###2817 ZABOO: Don't kick yourself.
###2817 He's got some great equipment.
###2819 CODEX: How do you know?
###2820 ZABOO: I inspected him on the server.
###2821 Boot to helm.
###2822 CODEX: Oh.
###2822 Yeah, right.
###2823 His character's armor is very sexy.
###2825 ZABOO: Totally.
###2826 CODEX: Uh--
###2828 I gotta get back to Cheesybeards, film that stupid
###2830 commercial.
###2831 Work is the solace of sorrow, right?
###2833 Oh, God.
###2834 That was a quote.
###2835 ZABOO: I knew it.
###2836 You're not over him.
###2837 Well, everything has happened just as I imagined.
###2839 But don't worry, best friend.
###2840 I prepared for this.
###2842 Fawkes.
###2844 FAWKES: It takes one to forgive, two to reconcile.
###2848 Generic greeting card.
###2849 ZABOO: He's good.
###2850 CODEX: What are you doing here?
###2851 FAWKES: I wanted to see how this scene played out.
###2853 ZABOO: See?
###2853 The sidekick always reunites the heroine with the hero.
###2855 CODEX: Not if the heroine thinks the hero is
###2857 a total tool bag.
###2858 ZABOO: But I was just trying to get rid of the mopey
###2859 montage part of your sadness.
###2861 CODEX: Well, yet again, your attempts are totally well
###2863 intentioned, but overboard and inappropriate.
###2866 FAWKES: Are you sure that you're over me?
###2868 CODEX: And you--
###2869 stop trolling me in real life.
###2871 ZABOO: Bye, Fawkes.
###2871 Oh.
###2872 Oh.
###2874 [INAUDIBLE]
###2875 
###2881 I got it from this guy who does van art.
###2884 The likenesses are pretty special.
###2885 
###2889 CODEX: I am not going to talk about the Fawkes thing.
###2891 Or how everyone in the guild now thinks I'm a liar.
###2894 And forget about the Zaboo thing.
###2895 I am not talking about that, either.
###2897 I mean, how dense do you have to be to think that--
###2899 see?
###2899 I'm talking about all the stuff I said I wasn't gonna
###2901 talk about.
###2902 We just finished filming the Cheesybeards commercial.
###2904 We've been up all night.
###2905 Bladezz is gonna edit it, and add some graphics and stuff
###2908 before he uploads it.
###2909 I'm kind of excited to see it.
###2910 Maybe I'll discover a hidden talent for
###2912 filmmaking and win an award.
###2913 Do film festivals have a category for best local
###2916 internet commercial?
###2917 Heh.
###2918 I was daydreaming about the acceptance speech.
###2921 Stupid.
###2922 I would definitely wear something strapless.
###2924 
###2927 [FESTIVE MUSIC]
###2935 BLADEZZ: Burgers ahoy!
###2936 Want to know why my roger is so [BLEEP]
###2939 jolly?
###2939 Come on down to Cheesybeards for all your
###2942 pirate burger needs!
###2944 Uh!
###2945 
###2947 Enjoy.
###2949 Wow.
###2950 Cheesybeards really knows how to serve it up.
###2954 These competitors can walk the plank!
###2957 Man overboard!
###2959 Arrgh--
###2960 I'm a pirate!
###2961 
###2963 So don't settle for shark bait.
###2965 Walk the plank down to Cheesybeards, and taste--
###2968 taste--
###2969 taste--
###2970 taste my pirate patty.
###2972 Cheesybeards.
###2973 OLLIE: Sherman!
###2975 I'm scuttling this project--
###2976 you're fired!
###2977 CODEX: No, no, we put a lot of work into that video.
###2980 OLLIE: Ah, it looks like a grog- dazed orangutan made it.
###2983 And what is "taste my pirate patty?" Yeah, I got a dozen
###2987 crank messages on my machine, and nothin' but
###2989 empty tables out there.
###2991 CODEX: 'Cause someone put in some editing magic before they
###2994 uploaded it, without telling me.
###2995 OLLIE: Don't pass the doubloon, Sherman.
###2997 A captain always goes down with the ship.
###2999 CODEX: OK.
###3000 Just give me one last chance.
###3001 I will get people in here, I promise.
###3003 OLLIE: Oh, Sherman.
###3004 This place is all I got.
###3006 And a man with one hand can't carve out a business for
###3009 himself every day.
###3010 BLADEZZ: Can't carve out anything if it's his dominant
###3012 hand, right?
###3012 [LAUGHTER]
###3014 OLLIE: Oo, you're a hoot, lad.
###3016 Never stop talking.
###3018 Two days, Sherman.
###3019 You get birds at the brownie buffet.
###3021 Or we're through!
###3022 
###3027 Unh.
###3028 TINKERBALLA: Clara--
###3029 We agreed to print 50 t-shirts.
###3030 CLARA: I did order 50.
###3031 Then the guy said 50 gross, and I said yeah, guys would
###3035 think they're gross.
###3036 I thought he was flirting.
###3037 TINKERBALLA: A gross is 144.
###3039 50 gross is this.
###3041 CLARA: Well, can't we return them?
###3042 TINKERBALLA: Sweatshops don't do refunds.
###3044 God, we're out so much money.
###3046 MR. WIGGLY: Honey, did you make a withdrawal from our
###3048 savings account?
###3049 CLARA: I needed the seed money for the business.
###3051 MR. WIGGLY: This is for the kids' college fund.
###3053 CLARA: Oh, all of them don't need to go.
###3054 Choose one.
###3057 Don't worry.
###3057 We'll sell them all.
###3058 TINKERBALLA: And how do we plan to do that?
###3060 CLARA: Sshh, sshh--
###3061 geez, the game trading house is out of control.
###3064 Leather's up 15 gold per stack?
###3066 Is somebody hoarding it or something?
###3068 TINKERBALLA: Must be a server glitch.
###3069 VORK: Leather.
###3070 I am the Dragothian king of leather.
###3073 The power is-- ha, ha, ha--
###3077 Where's your mother?
###3078 Did she place this wig warmer here as a decoy?
###3080 Find her.
###3081 Find her!
###3082 ZABOO: In a minute.
###3083 I gotta auction off this painting.
###3084 It's just a constant reminder of my failure to become
###3086 friends with Codex.
###3087 I need a good, like, title description.
###3089 Go!
###3090 VORK: Highland Ecstasy.
###3091 ZABOO: Oh, yeah.
###3091 VORK: Zaboo, your mother's obsessed with me.
###3093 This morning she wanted to go for a walk, with no
###3094 discernible destination.
###3096 Completely baffling.
###3097 ZABOO: Dude, it's your place.
###3098 Tell her to leave.
###3099 VORK: But I need her brilliant economic mind.
###3101 One minute, she's helping me create an empire.
###3103 The next, she's trying to rearrange my novelty straw
###3105 collection.
###3105 It enrages me.
###3107 ZABOO: That's the way she operates.
###3108 She's like the wobble demon of the Iktar Plain.
###3110 She looks like a cute and cuddly bunny.
###3111 But then, it sucks the life force out of you, as soon as
###3113 you get within aggro distance.
###3115 Huh.
###3115 Highland sextacy.
###3117 That's catchy.
###3118 VORK: Agreed.
###3119 ZABOO'S MOM: Lunch time.
###3121 Tofu burgers, and beached whale vitamins.
###3124 VORK: I do not eat this type of, quote, food, unquote.
###3128 Mrs. Zaboo, this is not working out.
###3130 I need you to leave--
###3131 ZABOO'S MOM: Oh-- you've cornered the leather market.
###3133 But with the price so high, the customer
###3134 base is sure to decline.
###3136 VORK: It will?
###3137 What do I do?
###3138 ZABOO'S MOM: Oh.
###3139 Start a loan company.
###3140 With that, you can get interest and trading fees.
###3144 But--
###3145 you were about to say something.
###3147 VORK: Nothing.
###3148 ZABOO: Wobble demoned.
###3148 [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
###3149 CODEX: Can you hear me?
###3150 Hi.
###3151 Guys?
###3151 ZABOO: Hey, Codex.
###3152 Great commercial.
###3153 CLARA: Yeah.
###3153 It's so bad, I linked it to everyone I know.
###3156 CODEX: Ollie's so mad at me.
###3157 I came home after lunch 'cause I started crying
###3159 in my Scurvy Fries.
###3160 TINKERBALLA: Codex-- your mike is messed up.
###3161 You sound like a chipmunk.
###3163 CODEX: I know.
###3163 My computer's still not working.
###3165 I'm thoroughly worried--
###3166 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###3167 I want to apologize for lying to everybody.
###3170 You guys--
###3170 don't yell at me--
###3172 SOBBING]
###3173 TINKERBALLA: You're not going to let me boot her, are you?
###3175 CLARA: No.
###3176 It's super annoying, but we should do something.
###3180 CODEX: Thanks for letting me come over.
###3181 It's nice to know everyone in the guild doesn't hate me for
###3183 being a lying whore-bag.
###3184 CLARA: We don't hate you.
###3185 We're excited for you.
###3187 
###3189 [COUGHS]
###3191 CODEX: Clara--
###3192 this is pure vodka.
###3193 CLARA: I'm a mom at heart.
###3194 Drink up, honey.
###3195 TINKERBALLA: I knew the whole Fawkes thing didn't add up.
###3198 He wanted you as a girlfriend, but only wanted to go on one
###3201 date with me?
###3202 Achh.
###3202 Impossible.
###3203 CODEX: Wait.
###3204 You went out with him, too?
###3205 TINKERBALLA: How do you think I got into
###3206 their guild so quick?
###3207 I don't do trial periods.
###3210 CODEX: No wonder you were so mad at me.
###3213 Listen, I know exactly how you feel.
###3215 When you have sex with someone, you think it's gonna
###3216 be a long time deal, you know?
###3218 TINKERBALLA: Sex?
###3219 Let's be clear.
###3220 He only got to second base with me.
###3222 And my second base is really everyone else's first.
###3225 CODEX: Wow.
###3225 You know when you play in an area that's way too high-level
###3227 for you, so you have to get killed over and over again
###3230 before you wise up and go back to an easier area to play?
###3232 TINKERBALLA: Is this going somewhere?
###3233 CODEX: That's what I've been doing in real life.
###3235 Fawkes was too high level for me, this job is too
###3238 high level for me.
###3239 I mean, why did I think I could ever get people to eat
###3241 at a restaurant?
###3242 I don't have that skill set.
###3244 That's it.
###3245 I give up.
###3246 I'm not going back.
###3247 CLARA: I'd have Wiggly take the family, but it is the last
###3250 day of the Sea Festival, so--
###3252 CODEX: It's OK.
###3252 I have a backup plan to get a new computer.
###3254 TINKERBALLA: Youre lying again.
###3255 CODEX: You're right.
###3257 Can I take the sippy cup with me?
###3259 CLARA: Yeah.
###3259 CODEX: Thank you.
###3260 
###3262 ZABOO: Is Codex OK?
###3264 Tell her I picked all the wrong
###3265 dialogue options yesterday.
###3266 If I could reload my save game, I totally would.
###3268 TINKERBALLA: She just left.
###3269 But, I was nice to her, and I feel good about myself.
###3271 That's all that's interesting right now.
###3273 CLARA: She's totally bummed about the whole
###3274 Cheesybeards thing.
###3275 She said she's not going back.
###3277 ZABOO: We gotta help her.
###3278 And I have to participate in an extremely moderate way.
###3280 CLARA: We do.
###3281 Now how to get people to the restaurant?
###3285 Oh my God, my thinking cap just gave me a great idea.
###3288 ZABOO: Yes.
###3288 An Idea.
###3290 From Clara.
###3291 CLARA: I know, right?
###3292 
###3294 CODEX: Ooh--
###3295 three relationships in my life have ended with a whimper.
###3298 A boyfriend in high school, a boyfriend in college, and my
###3300 cousin Christine.
###3301 After a while we just stopped calling each other.
###3303 They faded away.
###3304 It was easier that way.
###3305 No messy break-ups.
###3306 Well, Christine forged my signature and took a bunch of
###3309 credit cards out in my name, so, I guess that's a whole
###3312 'nother story.
###3313 Now, I'm adding one more name to that list--
###3315 Ollie.
###3315 Pirate man.
###3316 Maybe he won't even notice I'm gone.
###3318 I hope he doesn't track me down and keelhaul me.
###3320 I wish I had a working computer.
###3321 I could look up what that word really means.
###3323 [CELLPHONE RINGS]
###3325 Oh--
###3325 It's Ollie.
###3326 So much for a whimper.
###3327 Rude.
###3329 Ohh--
###3331 [MUSIC PLAYS]
###3338 ZABOO: The fabric is milk-resistant.
###3341 Oh, hey--
###3342 Welcome to Cheesybeards.
###3343 And the Festival Under the Sea Festival.
###3345 TINKERBALLA: Zaboo--
###3346 I told you to stop saying that.
###3347 It's stupid and redundant.
###3348 ZABOO: Well, welcome to Cheesybeards, and the Festival
###3350 Under the Sea event.
###3351 That is not a festival.
###3352 CODEX: You guys, what's going on here?
###3354 CLARA: Well, we threw it together
###3354 after you left my house.
###3356 Thanks to my plus 20, too intelligent squid hat.
###3358 ZABOO: Yeah, we spammed general chat, and everyone
###3360 showed up to celebrate the last day of the Festival Under
###3362 the Sea Fest--
###3363 uh-- thing-a- ma- bob.
###3364 CLARA: And Pregamers even has a place to sell shirts to
###3367 pregnant gamer ladies.
###3368 CUSTOMER: Awesome.
###3369 I'll take one of those.
###3369 CLARA: Oh, but we're not--
###3370 TINKERBALLA: Give our largest shirt to this man over here.
###3372 It'll fit fine.
###3374 ZABOO: And Bladezz actually helped, in exchange for some
###3375 stage space.
###3377 CUSTOMER 2: My brother did a mash-up of you
###3379 and keyboard cat.
###3379 Can I have your autograph?
###3381 BLADEZZ: Well, yeah.
###3382 Uh, which boob do I sign?
###3384 CUSTOMER 2: Oh my god-- he's just as skeevy in real life.
###3386 BLADEZZ: Yeah.
###3386 OLLIE: A--
###3387 hoy.
###3388 Well, you've, uh, blown a fair wind.
###3391 CODEX: Actually, I didn't--
###3392 CLARA: Lie, lie.
###3393 You're good at that now, remember?
###3394 OLLIE: What?
###3394 Eh?
###3395 CODEX: Um, thank you.
###3396 Ollie.
###3396 It's been a lot to coordinate from my home, but, uh, I think
###3399 everything has turned out great.
###3400 OLLIE: Yeah, well, you filled the galley tighter than a
###3403 booty chest.
###3404 [LAUGHTER]
###3406 Entertainment?
###3406 Eh?
###3407 CLARA: Oh--
###3407 Bladezz is gonna put on a magic show later.
###3410 OLLIE: Oh.
###3410 CODEX: Yeah, that.
###3411 ZABOO: And the 8-bit band got cut, 'cause we didn't want to
###3412 go overboard on anything.
###3413 OLLIE: No band?
###3415 No worries.
###3416 We can drop anchor for that, eh?
###3419 Eh, beauty?
###3420 [SINGS]
###3420 So I pull off their balls, and sever their heads, ran them
###3425 all through till the deck had run red, scooped up the goop
###3428 from their skull like molasses, pulled out their
###3430 lungs and filleted their asses, served a--
###3432 VORK: Mrs. Zaboo, I can handle my own drinking, thank you.
###3433 OLLIE: --my belly was full by the time I was through.
###3437 [LAUGHTER]
###3438 Arrgh.
###3439 
###3442 VORK: Will not happen, sir.
###3442 OLLIE: Oh, you cheap bastard.
###3445 ZABOO: Great lute playing, Codex.
###3447 CODEX: I only know three chords.
###3449 ZABOO: Three amazing chords.
###3450 Heh.
###3451 FLUFFYKINS: Sir Vork?
###3453 I need to talk to you about my potion portfolio?
###3455 VORK: Fluffykins, of Gigglebunny guild, I presume?
###3458 FLUFFYKINS: No one's investing in the potion market.
###3460 It's hit bottom.
###3461 I need another week to pay my debt back.
###3464 VORK: You should have considered the long-term
###3465 repercussions, before you took a game loan through my Knights
###3468 of Goloanar Corp.
###3469 FLUFFYKINS: It seems unfair that you run
###3471 the stocks and loans.
###3472 VORK: Are you trying to regulate me, sir?
###3473 Are you a socialist?
###3474 ZABOO'S MOM: The price of Infinite Potion
###3476 has hit a new low.
###3477 VORK: Fluffykins, I suggest you start grinding.
###3479 The deadline stays.
###3481 [BANG]
###3482 FLUFFYKINS: Mm!
###3483 ZABOO: Vork, you can't keep manipulating the game.
###3484 You're bankrupting people.
###3486 VORK: Amassing a fortune will benefit the game economy in
###3488 the long run.
###3489 ZABOO: Trickle downed.
###3490 VORK: The guild hall is within my reach.
###3493 
###3497 ZABOO'S MOM: Oopsie, Mr. Vork.
###3498 Allow me.
###3499 
###3505 There.
###3505 All better.
###3508 VORK: Zaboo.
###3509 I'm going to the men's bathroom.
###3511 Accompany me.
###3512 
###3514 CODEX: Oh, no.
###3515 OLLIE: Well.
###3516 How 'bout a ballad, mateys?
###3518 FAWKES: Music is essentially useless.
###3520 Santayana.
###3521 OLLIE: How'd you like to scrape a
###3522 barnacle off me rudder?
###3524 Eh, shark bait?!
###3525 FAWKES: Nice hook.
###3528 CODEX: So, it's nice to--
###3530 I'm seein' ya.
###3531 Heh.
###3531 VALKYRIE: Hey, yeah, I heard this whole "lass" look was
###3533 coming back in this season-- huh, huh-- but gratz.
###3536 You managed to make it look really awkward.
###3538 RILEY: She looks OK.
###3540 Let me get you one of those, my sweet.
###3542 Be my wench?
###3543 VENOM: Any day of the week.
###3544 FAWKES: I was just pointing out the table where you begged
###3546 me to date you.
###3548 That experience inspired me to blog about the feminine ego.
###3550 Got tons of up votes at Reddit.
###3552 CODEX: Should I be impressed?
###3553 FAWKES: Well it made the front page, so--
###3555 yes.
###3555 CODEX: Well, I don't have to suck up your snark anymore, so
###3558 go blow a fair wind outta your arggh holes.
###3560 
###3565 VORK: Dry!
###3565 Dry!
###3566 I've been poisoned.
###3567 ZABOO: Dude, that's what moms do, man.
###3569 I mean, she's been licking my hair since I
###3570 was four years old.
###3571 In lieu of shampoo.
###3572 VORK: But this is 50% of my wardrobe that I have to burn
###3574 when I arrive home.
###3576 What are you doing?
###3577 ZABOO: I'm going to the bathroom,
###3578 'cause we're in a bathroom.
###3578 VORK: This is a conference.
###3580 Find a better time and place.
###3582 ZABOO: I'm in mid-stream.
###3583 VORK: Auhh--
###3583 just hurry up.
###3586 [GASP]
###3587 FAWKES: Go out with me again.
###3588 CODEX: Are you kidding?
###3590 Now?
###3590 Why?
###3591 Why, why now?
###3592 FAWKES: Contrary to my expectations, this entire
###3595 experience has been very interesting to me.
###3598 You're interesting, Codex.
###3599 And that has surprised me.
###3601 CODEX: Well, you have been a total d-bag.
###3603 So, that has not surprised me.
###3605 Why would I go out with you again?
###3608 FAWKES: I make good brownies?
###3610 JEANETTE: Look at that.
###3612 It's good to see you again, cutie.
###3614 FAWKES: Ah, you must be the waitress.
###3615 I will have a glass of water, please, room
###3618 temperature, no ice.
###3618 Thank you.
###3619 JEANETTE: Oh, no.
###3620 You think you can just get all up in Jeanette and then treat
###3623 her like hired help?
###3624 CODEX: You got all up in Jeanette?
###3626 FAWKES: Well, I was until very recently an epicurean--
###3628 JEANETTE: I'm gonna give you something
###3629 there is no cure for.
###3632 FAWKES: Whoop!
###3633 
###3637 VORK: 'Cause your bladder's like the Hindenburg.
###3639 ZABOO: OK, I'm done, I'm done.
###3640 VORK: Now look, Zaboo.
###3641 We need to jettison your mom out of our lives completely.
###3643 Tell me what repulses women.
###3645 It seems to be your specialty.
###3645 You're very, very good at it.
###3646 ZABOO: Well, I don't know, I mean, Codex says I overdo
###3648 everything, so why don't you just go overboard, you know,
###3650 make a giant gesture that's really inappropriate, and then
###3651 she'll run the other way.
###3652 VORK: Go overboard.
###3653 OK.
###3654 Formulating--
###3655 ZABOO: I, I know this guy who does van art, so--
###3657 collect fingernail clippings, and make a necklace out of--
###3659 VORK: Stop.
###3660 I've got it.
###3660 Let's go.
###3661 ZABOO: All right.
###3662 I'm going.
###3662 Uh--
###3663 I gotta wash my hands It's the law.
###3664 JEANETTE: I've had better sex with a bicycle seat.
###3667 [CRASH]
###3667 TINKERBALLA: That satisfies something in my brain.
###3670 Like, a lot.
###3671 CODEX: Jeanette must be a boxer.
###3672 JEANETTE: Mixed martial arts.
###3675 CODEX: I am such an idiot with men.
###3677 This is a lesson.
###3678 Paladins over Rogues.
###3679 TINKERBALLA: You should make a men's litmus test.
###3680 It's the one thing in chemistry I learned when I
###3682 wasn't sleeping.
###3683 CODEX: A litmus test?
###3684 What do you mean?
###3684 Like, a checklist or something?
###3686 TINKERBALLA: I did the negatives.
###3687 No misers, no amputees, no cuddlers.
###3689 CODEX: That's a weird list.
###3691 OK.
###3692 I can do that.
###3692 And then the next time someone asks me out, I will say,
###3694 excuse me, and consult my list before responding.
###3697 TINKERBALLA: Uh, yeah.
###3697 You better stick to online dating.
###3699 DENA: Hey, wench.
###3700 Bladezz needs you to help him out with the magic show.
###3702 CODEX: Can't you do it?
###3703 DENA: I'm center stage, or nothing at all.
###3704 
###3710 BLADEZZ: Is that your card?
###3711 VALKYRIE: No.
###3712 BLADEZZ: Are you sure?
###3713 I believe it is.
###3715 VALKYRIE: Prove it.
###3716 
###3720 VORK: I'll cut to the chase, because I want this to end.
###3722 Mrs. Zaboo?
###3724 Will you marry me?
###3725 ZABOO'S MOM: Oh my goodness--
###3728 yes.
###3729 Yes, I will.
###3732 ZABOO: So.
###3732 What'd I miss?
###3732 BLADEZZ: Ladies and Gentlemen--
###3734 for my next trick, that I have never done
###3737 before, I will eat fire.
###3740 [APPLAUSE]
###3745 [FIRE EXPLODES]
###3746 [SCREAMS]
###3750 OLLIE: Fire in the hole!
###3752 
###3758 CODEX: I can't believe Ollie fired us because we set the
###3760 restaurant on fire.
###3761 [LAUGHTER]
###3762 I'm sorry.
###3763 It's just, like, so lamely ironic.
###3765 I'm never getting a new computer now.
###3767 Well that sobered me up.
###3769 Someone filmed the whole thing from the audience and posted
###3771 it, so now Bladezz is even more internet famous.
###3773 And, if possible, more irritating.
###3775 This is a good life lesson--
###3776 never try anything new, or you will fail.
###3778 What else is going on?
###3780 Oh, yeah--
###3780 Vork is marrying Zaboo's mom.
###3782 [LAUGHS]
###3782 I'm laughing, because that sounds so crazy.
###3786 I think I'm hysterical.
###3787 Heh.
###3789 ZABOO: Codex.
###3791 Please, talk to him.
###3791 I can't become related to Vork.
###3793 If that happens, I'm gonna replace all my organs with
###3795 clockwork, and then sell myself to a Steampunk museum.
###3798 Ah, ah--
###3798 CODEX: Hey, hey, hey, stop it.
###3800 Stop.
###3800 OK, calm down.
###3801 Vork--
###3802 you do not want to do this.
###3803 VORK: Of course I don't.
###3804 The very thought of marrying this woman
###3806 makes my prostate throb.
###3807 [KNOCKING]
###3808 ZABOO'S MOM: Fiance Vork, the ASPCA has come and taken all
###3812 your birds.
###3812 Their sound is quite distracting.
###3815 VORK: I understand.
###3816 [BLOWS A KISS]
###3819 VORK: Mentally, I'm in hospice, waiting to die.
###3821 Numb.
###3822 So numb.
###3823 CODEX: So just tell her you changed your mind.
###3824 VORK: A verbal offer of marriage is a contractual
###3826 obligation.
###3827 Herman Holden's word is his honor.
###3829 His honor, by Jupiter!
###3830 CLARA: Codex, stop trying to ruin my fun.
###3832 I'm so deep into wedding planning now.
###3834 Horses' ovaries for everyone.
###3835 Num, num, num, num, num.
###3837 TINKERBALLA: Don't you mean hors d'oeuvres?
###3838 CLARA: Sure, we can have those, too.
###3839 CODEX: Wait, wait-- so you're planning it?
###3841 Didn't you just skip your own sister's wedding?
###3843 CLARA: Zaboo's mom is letting me be a
###3844 bridesmaid, not a matron.
###3846 Plus, we're having it at my house, so the
###3847 commute's super easy.
###3848 CODEX: Give it some time.
###3849 Vork will come to his senses.
###3850 CLARA: So 7:00 PM tomorrow.
###3852 I'm drafting the cyber-vite now.
###3853 ZABOO: Tomorrow?
###3854 What?
###3854 Are you kidding me?
###3855 CLARA: Wiggly's ordained.
###3856 There's no need to delay.
###3857 ZABOO: Oh-- it sounds realler now.
###3859 Oo.
###3860 Oh, dry heaved.
###3860 CODEX: Ew.
###3861 [DOORBELL]
###3862 ZABOO: I'll get it.
###3864 CODEX: If that's a subpoena from Ollie, do not take it.
###3866 I'm too delicate for jail time.
###3868 Vork, stop this insanity.
###3869 VORK: From a practical standpoint, this situation
###3871 does have its advantages.
###3873 She's already set the precedent
###3874 for paying for meals.
###3875 I think a carefully worded pre-nuptial agreement could
###3877 establish acceptable living parameters.
###3879 How do you spell "saliva?"
###3883 CODEX: What is that?
###3884 CLARA: How much do you think an ice sculpture of Vork's
###3886 game character and Avinashi in a sari would cost?
###3888 TINKERBALLA: Clara?
###3889 We sold 12 shirts yesterday, but we still have tons of
###3891 stock left.
###3892 So what's our next step?
###3893 CLARA: Business talk is so fun.
###3895 Let me do one.
###3896 We must strategize, to monetize.
###3899 How fancy do I sound?
###3900 TINKERBALLA: This isn't a game.
###3901 We're supposed to be making money, but
###3902 we're not doing that.
###3903 CLARA: That's OK.
###3904 I'm done now.
###3905 TINKERBALLA: What?
###3906 With what?
###3907 CLARA: I think I should focus on being pregnant.
###3909 I have to work in game and the kids like to hang out with me
###3911 some, so that's a lot.
###3913 TINKERBALLA: But we have 7,000 shirts left.
###3915 CLARA: Well, we can just put 'em in the wedding gift bags.
###3919 OK--
###3919 remember to bring your mom's garter belt to the reception.
###3922 ZABOO: And you are web cammed.
###3925 CODEX: I can't believe you bought me a new computer.
###3927 I should make you send it back.
###3928 ZABOO: No guilt.
###3929 It's legitimately yours.
###3930 I paid for it by eBaying that painting of you and Fawkes.
###3932 CODEX: Wait, are you kidding?
###3934 Who'd buy that thing?
###3935 ZABOO: An author.
###3935 Yelena Caress, for her new romance novel--
###3937 "As His Kilt Rises."
###3939 CODEX: I read all her stuff.
###3941 I'll probably buy that one in e-book, though.
###3943 ZABOO: You know, it was really tough just becoming, like,
###3945 just your friend, But I think our relationship has been
###3947 successfully retconned.
###3949 What is this?
###3950 Litmus test.
###3951 Kind, funny, smells good, gamer--
###3953 CODEX: That's nothing.
###3954 You are right.
###3955 We have come a long way.
###3956 I mean, not that a physical object can really transform.
###3959 That's shallow.
###3961 You are a really good friend.
###3963 OK, I'm logging on, for the first time.
###3964 I'm so excited.
###3966 ZABOO: I am too!
###3968 
###3970 VORK: Guildies, I'd like to focus your attention on
###3972 something very important.
###3973 ZABOO: More important than you marrying my mom?
###3975 VORK: I have earned a half a million gold, and I am about
###3978 to purchase the Knights of Good guild hall.
###3980 ZABOO: Oot!
###3981 Thanks for waiting for us to log back on.
###3982 CLARA: Vork, how did you get that much money
###3984 in such little time?
###3985 Hacks.
###3986 VORK: Innovation, my friends.
###3989 I am a titan of industry.
###3990 A financial wizard.
###3992 So very rich.
###3994 Mm, mm mm.
###3996 CODEX: But you've made everything so expensive
###3997 in-game, nobody can afford anything anymore.
###3999 VORK: There has been a touch of inflation.
###4001 But I expect the market to self-adjust within six months.
###4003 CLARA: Business words aren't fun when you say them.
###4006 VORK: Everyone--
###4007 gather to me, and behold the glory that is the Knights of
###4010 Good deluxe guild hall.
###4014 ZABOO: Oo.
###4016 CODEX: It kinda looks like a prison.
###4018 VORK: You're welcome.
###4019 ZABOO: OK, now that we have it, what do we do with it?
###4021 VORK: We gather in it.
###4022 Son.
###4023 ZABOO: Did he just call me "son?"
###4025 CODEX: This keyboard is so responsive.
###4026 
###4030 TINKERBALLA: I came back.
###4030 CLARA: You left?
###4031 TINKERBALLA: I just wanted to say that I like doing business
###4033 with you, hanging out is fun, and I'd like to
###4036 keep working together.
###4039 Please?
###4040 CLARA: Oh my gosh.
###4041 Did you just use the p-word?
###4043 TINKERBALLA: Yes.
###4043 You're a stupid influence.
###4045 CLARA: Aw.
###4046 CODEX: Zaboo?
###4047 
###4049 OK.
###4050 This quiet calm thing you're doing right now?
###4051 This is--
###4052 this is freaking me out.
###4053 ZABOO: Codex.
###4054 Stop the wedding.
###4055 CODEX: OK.
###4056 ZABOO: You have to stop the wedding.
###4059 CODEX: Don't worry.
###4059 I will do this.
###4061 Nothing can get in the way of true friendship, if you're
###4063 determined, and truth is on your side.
###4065 [BELL CHIMES]
###4069 CODEX: I thought if I said it with determination, something
###4070 would come to me.
###4071 ZABOO: This is the nightmare level.
###4072 Just Control- Alt- Delete me.
###4074 VORK: Unfortunately, my new paternal role will require us
###4076 to spend more quality time with each other.
###4078 I am now looking forward to enjoying this sporting object
###4080 in an outdoor setting with you.
###4082 
###4084 CODEX: Bladezz.
###4084 What the-- ?
###4086 ZABOO: Oh.
###4087 The devil's here.
###4088 That makes sense.
###4089 BLADEZZ: Sorry I'm late.
###4090 Been busy with fan maintenance, baby.
###4093 Live chats, vlogging--
###4094 the job of being me is 24/7 now.
###4097 MR. WIGGLY: Uh, the bride is ready for the--
###4100 the-- yeah.
###4104 Please be seated.
###4105 
###4119 [MUSIC PLAYING - THE WEDDING MARCH]
###4120 
###4130 ZABOO'S MOM: What is this?
###4132 CLARA: I made your character just like you.
###4133 Except taller.
###4134 
###4139 MR. WIGGLY: We are gathered here today--
###4141 TINKERBALLA: We can't hear you.
###4142 MR. WIGGLY: Sorry.
###4143 Button pushed.
###4145 We are gathered here today to join these two video game
###4149 characters in cyber matrimony.
###4154 ZABOO'S MOM: This is very confusing.
###4159 MR. WIGGLY: Yeah.
###4160 Yeah, it is.
###4163 CODEX: So we're all in Clara's dining room.
###4166 I'm playing the wedding march into my desktop, and I look
###4169 around, and we look like some freaky reality show. "Amazing
###4172 Geeks," or "Nerdy Shore," or "The Biggest Losers," or--
###4176 never mind.
###4176 Zaboo tried so hard to be a good friend to me.
###4179 I really owed it to him to try to do something
###4181 to stop this wedding.
###4182 And it's not because he gave me a new computer, OK?
###4184 That's where I'm doing this from-- do I look fancier?
###4186 Sorry.
###4187 We really have become friends.
###4189 Despite his complete lack of social skills, Zaboo is a
###4192 smart, funny guy.
###4193 He's kind, and considerate--
###4195 oh, God, those are all things on my litmus test.
###4198 I gotta make this list way longer.
###4199 Good wardrobe, biceps, hairless fingers--
###4201 no, that's creepy.
###4203 
###4209 MR. WIGGLY: And if anyone present objects to this union,
###4213 speak now, or forever hold your peace.
###4215 UNISON: I object.
###4217 MR. WIGGLY: I don't think you're
###4218 supposed to actually answer.
###4219 It's just a formality.
###4222 BLADEZZ: Well that seems pretty unanimous.
###4224 So who wants to run a dungeon?
###4226 CLARA: I said no because I want to move to a
###4227 prettier game area.
###4229 The screen shots in here are terrible.
###4230 TINKERBALLA: The thought of Vork with any woman makes me
###4232 want to toss my boba.
###4234 But Zaboo's mom?
###4235 You're bat- [BLEEP]
###4236 crazy.
###4237 CODEX: I objected.
###4238 All right, did you see that?
###4238 I objected.
###4239 If there's anything I've learned in the last week, it's
###4241 that honesty is the best policy.
###4243 Or, if you're going to lie, you gotta cover your tracks
###4245 really well, and make sure there are no furrys involved.
###4247 Heh.
###4247 Anyway, Zaboo's mom--
###4248 are you 100% sure that you want to marry Vork?
###4251 
###4254 ZABOO'S MOM: I have nothing to go home to but an empty house.
###4257 Even though I can't abide the idea of touching Mr. Vork in
###4261 an intimate way, I'm desperate.
###4264 VORK: Are you referring to my in- game
###4265 or out of game character?
###4266 TINKERBALLA: Your out of game character?
###4268 Meaning you?
###4269 ZABOO'S MOM: And this way?
###4270 At least I can be with my son.
###4272 Even though he doesn't want me.
###4273 CODEX: So you're gonna marry someone you can't stand in
###4275 order to be close to someone who doesn't
###4277 want to be near you?
###4278 Tink is right.
###4278 That's kind bat [BLEEP]
###4279 crazy.
###4280 Heh, oh.
###4282 MR. WIGGLY: Uh, Clara?
###4283 Something bad is happening.
###4284 CLARA: Don't worry, honey.
###4285 She's only a level one.
###4286 Two seconds, and we can flatten her.
###4290 ZABOO: Mom?
###4291 CODEX: In-game.
###4291 Do it in-game.
###4293 ZABOO: Right.
###4293 Mom?
###4294 You came here to apologize to me for your
###4296 past mistakes, but--
###4297 you're not the only one.
###4298 I made a mistake, too.
###4299 And that was believing that you couldn't change.
###4301 And--
###4302 Dudes!
###4303 Could you not duel for one second while I deal with this?
###4306 Look, Mom--
###4307 I'm sorry.
###4309 I was wrong to make you feel unwanted.
###4310 But you don't have to settle for this awful, awful future.
###4313 You deserve better.
###4314 VORK: Uh, did I imbibe an invisibility spell?
###4317 Hello?
###4319 ZABOO'S MOM: You are so like your father.
###4321 Kind, loyal, smart.
###4323 I wish I could make amends with him, too.
###4326 CODEX: Whoa.
###4327 Litmus tested.
###4328 ZABOO: What?
###4329 Mom?
###4330 You don't have to marry Vork just hang out with me.
###4332 Occasionally.
###4333 On weekends.
###4333 Or, every other weekend.
###4335 ZABOO'S MOM: I'm so relieved.
###4336 If I had to do that, I would have just
###4339 drowned myself in a bathtub.
###4340 VORK: Then we should call it off.
###4341 Another crime scene is the last thing I
###4343 need in that house.
###4344 You should know, however, widows statistically have a
###4346 higher suicide rate.
###4347 And are more vulnerable to extortion
###4349 schemes and home invasions.
###4351 ZABOO'S MOM: How do I hug you in this game?
###4353 UNISON: Type "slash hug."
###4357 KEVINATOR: Knights of Good?
###4358 [FANFARE]
###4360 Direct me to your leaders.
###4362 TINKERBALLA: Oh my God.
###4363 That's the Death Lion Breast Plate.
###4365 
###4368 VORK: I am Vork.
###4369 Guild leader of the Knights of Good.
###4371 MALE VOICE: I'm Kevinator.
###4374 Official game master.
###4375 CLARA: A GM?
###4376 In person?
###4378 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###4380 VORK: Here's my pitch.
###4383 KEVINATOR: Guys--
###4384 I'm not here to help.
###4385 I'm here to rip XP out of someone's poop chute.
###4389 ZABOO'S MOM: Excuse me?
###4390 We are in the middle of my called-off wedding.
###4392 [ELECTRICAL ZAP]
###4394 What just happened?
###4395 CLARA: He's one of the people who work on the game.
###4397 Bow to your master.
###4401 KEVINATOR: Someone in this lame-ass guild is running an
###4403 illegal operation that's pretty much screwing with the
###4406 whole server economy.
###4407 Yeah, that would be Vork's Torgothian stock market.
###4410 Did you get my complaint?
###4411 VORK: Tattle Tink.
###4412 You're the worst in the country.
###4414 KEVINATOR: Dude?
###4415 I gotta shut you down.
###4416 If I see another forum post about inflated herb prices,
###4420 I'm gonna start destroying things.
###4422 And I can do that.
###4423 Because I am a god here.
###4426 [ZAP]
###4426 [ZAP]
###4428 [ZAP]
###4428 VORK: You can't shut me down.
###4429 It's the free market in action.
###4432 KEVINATOR: Yeah?
###4432 I'm gonna perma-ban you if you don't.
###4434 I can do that.
###4436 You wanna dance with me?
###4437 [ELECTRICAL SOUNDS]
###4441 ZABOO: Kevinator's kind of a dick.
###4443 VORK: Fine.
###4444 But you, sir, are a tyrant.
###4446 KEVINATOR: Read your terms of service.
###4449 This game ain't a democracy.
###4451 CODEX: Wait.
###4452 So, does that mean that half million gold that Vork earned
