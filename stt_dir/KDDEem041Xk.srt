EVAN TWYFORD: Three dimensional
design for me was


4
0:0:11,85 --> 0:0:14,93
always kind of the greatest
form of creation.


5
0:0:14,93 --> 0:0:19,79
Being able to take an idea from
that very tiny amount of


6
0:0:19,79 --> 0:0:22,19
energy, being this idea
in your head, and then


7
0:0:22,19 --> 0:0:24,53
formulating that into
a fully functional


8
0:0:24,53 --> 0:0:25,98
three-dimensional product.


9
0:0:25,98 --> 0:0:28,54
Take that a step further, I
always kind of wanted to


10
0:0:28,54 --> 0:0:32,25
design the ultimate three
dimensional object, right?


11
0:0:32,25 --> 0:0:35,97
And so designing space vehicles,
to me, was like that


12
0:0:35,97 --> 0:0:37,4
ultimate form of creation.


13
0:0:37,4 --> 0:0:39,6
It's like, what's the bad ass
thing you could design would


14
0:0:39,6 --> 0:0:40,74
be a spaceship.


15
0:0:40,74 --> 0:0:46,14
And NASA really was kind of
the final frontier for me.


16
0:0:46,14 --> 0:0:55,5



17
0:0:55,5 --> 0:0:59,13
My name's Evan Twyford, and I'm
a habitability designer at


18
0:0:59,13 --> 0:1:0,67
NASA's Johnson Space Center.


19
0:1:0,67 --> 0:1:6,94



20
0:1:6,94 --> 0:1:10,55
We in our group do conceptual
design for


21
0:1:10,55 --> 0:1:12,53
NASA's human space flight.


22
0:1:12,53 --> 0:1:17,73
A lot of these projects are
coming down as major kind of


23
0:1:17,73 --> 0:1:20,44
campaign level design projects,
where they're saying


24
0:1:20,44 --> 0:1:22,78
hey, we're doing a mission
to the moon.


25
0:1:22,78 --> 0:1:25,12
We're working on a pressurized
rover.


26
0:1:25,12 --> 0:1:27,38
We've got this idea, and
we want you guys to


27
0:1:27,38 --> 0:1:28,64
help us make it happen.


28
0:1:28,64 --> 0:1:30,82
Starting off with sketching
and rendering, very


29
0:1:30,82 --> 0:1:31,91
conceptual.


30
0:1:31,91 --> 0:1:37,4
Take it to a full scale mock
up phase out of wood, foam


31
0:1:37,4 --> 0:1:39,24
core, low fidelity materials.


32
0:1:39,24 --> 0:1:42,64
We use those to kind of sketch
out the volume of how big the


33
0:1:42,64 --> 0:1:45,9
vehicle might be, and how it
would feel on the inside.


34
0:1:45,9 --> 0:1:48,96
Part of what we'll do when we're
designing a habitat is


35
0:1:48,96 --> 0:1:52,2
we'll look at how the corners,
how the edges are treated.


36
0:1:52,2 --> 0:1:54,7
What type of paint schemes
are going to go inside.


37
0:1:54,7 --> 0:1:56,9
There was actually an issue with
one of the colors that


38
0:1:56,9 --> 0:1:58,7
they had painted on the
International Space Station,


39
0:1:58,7 --> 0:2:1,83
where one of the hatches was
like a salmon color.


40
0:2:1,83 --> 0:2:4,92
And the crew really disliked
it, so we try to


41
0:2:4,92 --> 0:2:7,8
avoid salmon now.


42
0:2:7,8 --> 0:2:9,74
And then working out the details
in a CAD system on the


43
0:2:9,74 --> 0:2:12,465
computer, and developing a fully
functional prototype.


44
0:2:12,465 --> 0:2:17,48



45
0:2:17,48 --> 0:2:20,86
And the type of design at NASA
that we do kind of crosses the


46
0:2:20,86 --> 0:2:23,15
line between fine art
and engineering.


47
0:2:23,15 --> 0:2:25,84
So it's a lot more problem
solving, though, which is what


48
0:2:25,84 --> 0:2:27,9
makes it really exciting.


49
0:2:27,9 --> 0:2:42,76



50
0:2:42,76 --> 0:2:49,79
So this is the SEV, the Space
Exploration Vehicle on the


51
0:2:49,79 --> 0:2:51,3
chassis, gen 1B.


52
0:2:51,3 --> 0:2:54,0



53
0:2:54,0 --> 0:2:59,29
For interior design for space
vehicles, there is certainly


54
0:2:59,29 --> 0:3:4,25
the problem of confinement,
which is a psychological issue


55
0:3:4,25 --> 0:3:5,67
for crew members over time.


56
0:3:5,67 --> 0:3:9,45
So we have to deal with ways of
designing environments and


57
0:3:9,45 --> 0:3:15,77
designing products that will
reduce the effects of feelings


58
0:3:15,77 --> 0:3:17,8
of confinement in space.


59
0:3:17,8 --> 0:3:24,75
So this is the interior of the
SEV rover gen 1B, and most of


60
0:3:24,75 --> 0:3:29,86
the interior design elements was
a product of our team, as


61
0:3:29,86 --> 0:3:32,95
well the robotics team that
we've been working with on


62
0:3:32,95 --> 0:3:34,58
this vehicle for some time.


63
0:3:34,58 --> 0:3:37,865
And we've kind of been charged
with making the interior of


64
0:3:37,865 --> 0:3:41,96
the vehicle more comfortable,
more luxurious, if you can


65
0:3:41,96 --> 0:3:43,21
call it that.


66
0:3:43,21 --> 0:3:50,2



67
0:3:50,2 --> 0:3:52,98
Seeing as most of us haven't
actually been to outer space,


68
0:3:52,98 --> 0:3:55,41
it can make things very
difficult sometimes, because


69
0:3:55,41 --> 0:3:57,31
everybody has a different
opinion, or different


70
0:3:57,31 --> 0:3:59,73
assumptions that they're
making about what that


71
0:3:59,73 --> 0:4:0,93
experience is like.


72
0:4:0,93 --> 0:4:5,4
So it's a very testing and
evaluation intensive work


73
0:4:5,4 --> 0:4:5,6
environment.


74
0:4:5,6 --> 0:4:9,74
So we have to do whatever we
can to ensure that these


75
0:4:9,74 --> 0:4:11,94
products will work in their
intended environment.


76
0:4:11,94 --> 0:4:16,589
So sometimes that means flying
products, or mock ups on zero


77
0:4:16,589 --> 0:4:21,98
gravity flight in the
parabolic aircraft.


78
0:4:21,98 --> 0:4:24,48
Sometimes it means going out
into the desert and testing


79
0:4:24,48 --> 0:4:29,31
them in a very harsh, kind of
desolate environment that


80
0:4:29,31 --> 0:4:31,49
might be similar to what we
would encounter in space.


81
0:4:31,49 --> 0:4:39,34



82
0:4:39,34 --> 0:4:41,98
There's always that kind of
thing with designers between


83
0:4:41,98 --> 0:4:43,77
are you going to be like, a
stylist, or are you going to


84
0:4:43,77 --> 0:4:44,82
be a problem solver?


85
0:4:44,82 --> 0:4:50,77
And you can look at a product
and say this accomplishes


86
0:4:50,77 --> 0:4:53,26
exactly what we need it to
accomplish, and that's what


87
0:4:53,26 --> 0:4:55,96
makes it beautiful, and that's
what makes it successful.


88
0:4:55,96 --> 0:4:59,5
It's a very pure design problem
that we're dealing


89
0:4:59,5 --> 0:5:4,22
with, which is to create
products and environments that


90
0:5:4,22 --> 0:5:9,64
the crew will find useful, and
will make them successful and


91
0:5:9,64 --> 0:5:13,7
productive in their
daily routines.


92
0:5:13,7 --> 0:5:16,18
MALE SPEAKER: Go for
main engine start.

0:5:16,18 --> 0:5:22,74
T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5--


94
0:5:22,74 --> 0:5:25,28
All three engines
up and burning.


95
0:5:25,28 --> 0:5:28,79
2, 1, 0, and lift off.


96
0:5:28,79 --> 0:5:30,36
The final lift off
of Atlantis.

EVAN TWYFORD: The shuttle
program and the International


99
0:5:35,15 --> 0:5:40,56
Space Station were started in
the '80s as sort of a longer


100
0:5:40,56 --> 0:5:43,34
term analog for human space
flight, and establishing a


101
0:5:43,34 --> 0:5:45,52
permanent human presence
in space.


102
0:5:45,52 --> 0:5:50,43
To start to learn more about
how humans would behave and


103
0:5:50,43 --> 0:5:53,78
interact in longer term space
flight scenarios.


104
0:5:53,78 --> 0:6:2,5



105
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:8,57
I've kind of felt like a lot of
people in general are maybe


106
0:6:8,57 --> 0:6:12,67
not as excited by the
International Space Station,


107
0:6:12,67 --> 0:6:13,95
or by the shuttle program.


108
0:6:13,95 --> 0:6:16,9
Or at least not as much as they
were maybe in the '80s,


109
0:6:16,9 --> 0:6:18,89
when the shuttle
was brand new.


110
0:6:18,89 --> 0:6:22,95
I just hope that we can really
re-engage people in the right


111
0:6:22,95 --> 0:6:25,1
way, and get people excited
about space flight.


112
0:6:25,1 --> 0:6:27,96
Because this next generation of
space vehicles is going to


113
0:6:27,96 --> 0:6:30,16
be the most bad ass that
we've ever seen.
