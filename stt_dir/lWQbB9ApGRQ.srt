0:0:5,71 --> 0:0:9,92
Bioblitz is a partnership that we've had with the National Geographic Society,  


2
0:0:9,92 --> 0:0:10,809



3
0:0:10,809 --> 0:0:15,659
where, we bring together, in a unit of the national park system,


4
0:0:15,659 --> 0:0:16,889
young people,


5
0:0:16,889 --> 0:0:18,17
and scientists,


6
0:0:18,17 --> 0:0:19,689
and park staff,


7
0:0:19,689 --> 0:0:22,69
for a twenty-four-hour intensive


8
0:0:22,69 --> 0:0:31,689
inventory of the natural resources of
the park.


9
0:0:31,689 --> 0:0:33,27
Biodiversity


10
0:0:33,27 --> 0:0:36,95
is one of the most important words in the English
language.


11
0:0:36,95 --> 0:0:41,74
And Bioblitz is about exploring, understanding, and documenting


12
0:0:41,74 --> 0:0:42,75
the diversity of life,


13
0:0:42,75 --> 0:0:44,17
biodiversity.


14
0:0:44,17 --> 0:0:48,99
And it's for all ages. It's to bring that joy to all ages. From the very youngest to the lifelong


15
0:0:48,99 --> 0:0:50,29
learners.


16
0:0:50,29 --> 0:0:51,39
Many of the kids have


17
0:0:51,39 --> 0:0:54,32
not really experienced what it's like to
be in


18
0:0:54,32 --> 0:0:58,3
nature that's less affected by humans. So sometimes it's 


19
0:0:58,3 --> 0:1:3,36
the first experience in getting close to people who care and close to the lovely 


20
0:1:3,36 --> 0:1:9,48
parts of nature.


21
0:1:9,48 --> 0:1:12,68
They need the experience of actually gathering the materials


22
0:1:12,68 --> 0:1:14,74
and being a part of


23
0:1:14,74 --> 0:1:18,77
everything and they need to know that
this is where it all starts,


24
0:1:18,77 --> 0:1:20,119
and we need to preserve it.


25
0:1:20,119 --> 0:1:23,359
And the only way they're going to really remember that is to 


26
0:1:23,359 --> 0:1:24,86
actually experience it.


27
0:1:24,86 --> 0:1:27,29
By being in the park. It's like, you know like, 


28
0:1:27,29 --> 0:1:31,3
watching a ball game on TV, and it's going to a ball game. They're two 


29
0:1:31,3 --> 0:1:33,1
completely different experiences.


30
0:1:33,1 --> 0:1:34,7
And you can learn all the plants' names


31
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:36,24
and what


32
0:1:36,24 --> 0:1:37,45
they look like in books,


33
0:1:37,45 --> 0:1:39,36
and you come out here in the field


34
0:1:39,36 --> 0:1:42,2
and you might be able to get a few of them but you're not going to be very good.


35
0:1:42,2 --> 0:1:44,65
Because there is just so much variation in nature


36
0:1:44,65 --> 0:1:51,13
that you just can't get it in a textbook.


37
0:1:51,13 --> 0:1:51,99
I'd rather be out here


38
0:1:51,99 --> 0:1:54,61
than in my classroom (laughter).


39
0:1:54,61 --> 0:1:57,13
Well sitting in a classroom 


40
0:1:57,13 --> 0:1:58,479
and studying science


41
0:1:58,479 --> 0:1:59,95
is important.


42
0:1:59,95 --> 0:2:3,54
But we've seen time and time again that
when you get kids out into the outdoors


43
0:2:3,54 --> 0:2:4,46



44
0:2:4,46 --> 0:2:6,24
something happens.


45
0:2:6,24 --> 0:2:12,369
Some change occurs in their psychology, that suddenly this is fun.


46
0:2:12,369 --> 0:2:15,329
It's not as dry,


47
0:2:15,329 --> 0:2:16,779
they're having discovery,


48
0:2:16,779 --> 0:2:18,93
and...a sense of wonder.


49
0:2:18,93 --> 0:2:20,589
It's amazing seeing the


50
0:2:20,589 --> 0:2:24,39
different ecosystems, the biodiversity,


51
0:2:24,39 --> 0:2:26,469
and seeing the tundra, which I've never been to before.


52
0:2:26,469 --> 0:2:29,249
I've never even been to Colorado before.


53
0:2:29,249 --> 0:2:33,399
Never really been to many forests. So this is just an amazing experience for me!


54
0:2:33,399 --> 0:2:38,59
It's great for people who have no
idea of what is around them


55
0:2:38,59 --> 0:2:40,9
and what is actually happening.


56
0:2:40,9 --> 0:2:44,509
Because, now biodiversity and environment and climate change have been in the


57
0:2:44,509 --> 0:2:51,399
limelight and have been talked about for so long.


58
0:2:51,399 --> 0:2:54,13
Having a scientifically literate society,


59
0:2:54,13 --> 0:2:56,43
has never been more important.


60
0:2:56,43 --> 0:3:0,239
The only way to build an increasingly literate
society,


61
0:3:0,239 --> 0:3:1,16
is by getting 


62
0:3:1,16 --> 0:3:4,319
kids turned on to science.


63
0:3:4,319 --> 0:3:8,269
Here at Bioblitz you actually get to interact with the animals


64
0:3:8,269 --> 0:3:9,649
and learn about stuff.


65
0:3:9,649 --> 0:3:12,69
And I think for kids, they actually


66
0:3:12,69 --> 0:3:13,839
become really excited


67
0:3:13,839 --> 0:3:15,439
and enthusiastic about...


68
0:3:15,439 --> 0:5:15,439
science.
