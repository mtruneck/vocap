2
0:0:4,59 --> 0:0:7,96
ROB DYRDEK: He's truly lived in
all of like the true skate


3
0:0:7,96 --> 0:0:10,51
meccas for pure street
skating.


4
0:0:10,51 --> 0:0:11,2
You know what I mean?


5
0:0:11,2 --> 0:0:12,89
Like no one else
has done that.


6
0:0:12,89 --> 0:0:16,92
When SF was cracking,
he moved to SF.


7
0:0:16,92 --> 0:0:20,43
When Philly was resurging,
he moved to Philly


8
0:0:20,43 --> 0:0:21,51
and blew Philly up.


9
0:0:21,51 --> 0:0:26,66
When LOVE Park went down, he
made the movement to spending


10
0:0:26,66 --> 0:0:30,5
six months a year
in Barcelona.


11
0:0:30,5 --> 0:0:33,44
And then he desperately tried
to Chicago into Philly.


12
0:0:33,44 --> 0:0:35,78
That didn't work out so hard.


13
0:0:35,78 --> 0:0:39,33
And he is pure of, wake
up in your house and


14
0:0:39,33 --> 0:0:40,9
go skate raw street.


15
0:0:40,9 --> 0:0:42,3
And a lot of people
can't say that.


16
0:0:42,3 --> 0:0:44,49
And he never followed trends.


17
0:0:44,49 --> 0:0:47,62
He hated on every trend as it
came and went, and talked


18
0:0:47,62 --> 0:0:48,8
about how wack it was.


19
0:0:48,8 --> 0:0:49,57
I don't even like that.


20
0:0:49,57 --> 0:0:51,22
And I'm like, that shit's
hard to do.


21
0:0:51,22 --> 0:0:53,37
That ain't hard to do,
that's just wack.


22
0:0:53,37 --> 0:0:54,81
And went through it all.


23
0:0:54,81 --> 0:0:58,29
And it's one of the purest,
pure street


24
0:0:58,29 --> 0:0:59,48
skateboarding careers.


25
0:0:59,48 --> 0:1:2,1
There's no like-- he didn't have
gimmicks in video parts.


26
0:1:2,1 --> 0:1:3,34
He didn't--


27
0:1:3,34 --> 0:1:5,3
there was no gimmicks in ads.


28
0:1:5,3 --> 0:1:7,49
You're going to look at his
footage from like whatever


29
0:1:7,49 --> 0:1:11,39
year that was, in like '98 till
this year, and it will


30
0:1:11,39 --> 0:1:14,43
seamlessly blend together.


31
0:1:14,43 --> 0:1:17,7
His pants and his shirts might
have gotten a shade tighter.


32
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:20,46
But all that footage would have
just blended together for


33
0:1:20,46 --> 0:1:23,83
his 15-year career.


34
0:1:23,83 --> 0:1:25,58
It's so weird, because
it's like, to me,


35
0:1:25,58 --> 0:1:27,1
he's still on Alien.


36
0:1:27,1 --> 0:1:29,16
Like he's such my--


37
0:1:29,16 --> 0:1:31,74
one of my very best friends
in the world.


38
0:1:31,74 --> 0:1:33,56
I know him so well.


39
0:1:33,56 --> 0:1:36,4
I talk to him about
everything.


40
0:1:36,4 --> 0:1:39,3
Nonstop, my advice to him, every
single time was, you're


41
0:1:39,3 --> 0:1:39,94
not me, man.


42
0:1:39,94 --> 0:1:42,88
Like do not waste your time and
headache trying to start


43
0:1:42,88 --> 0:1:44,19
companies and do this
other stuff.


44
0:1:44,19 --> 0:1:44,88
It's not worth it.


45
0:1:44,88 --> 0:1:46,84
Like, you are a skater.


46
0:1:46,84 --> 0:1:47,99
Just skate.


47
0:1:47,99 --> 0:1:49,938
MALE SPEAKER: Dude, fuck you--


48
0:1:49,938 --> 0:1:50,912
JOSH KALIS: Shut up!


49
0:1:50,912 --> 0:1:51,886
Pussy.


50
0:1:51,886 --> 0:1:53,347
MALE SPEAKER: I don't
want to get up.


51
0:1:53,347 --> 0:1:54,703
MALE SPEAKER: Just
fucking do it.


52
0:1:54,703 --> 0:1:56,8
JOSH KALIS: Shhhh.


53
0:1:56,8 --> 0:1:56,81
MALE SPEAKER: Come on, Dyrdek.


54
0:1:56,81 --> 0:1:58,195
Do this right now.


55
0:1:58,195 --> 0:1:59,7
ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: You think
he knows who who are?


56
0:1:59,7 --> 0:2:0,426
Just say Rob Dyrdek.


57
0:2:0,426 --> 0:2:3,11
What's up?


58
0:2:3,11 --> 0:2:5,93
JOSH KALIS: Being a dick
comes natural.


59
0:2:5,93 --> 0:2:8,184
ROB DYRDEK: Now, then, at the
end of the year, fall and next


60
0:2:8,184 --> 0:2:11,58
year's contract will be $1500
with an option to buy out.


61
0:2:11,58 --> 0:2:12,81
So it's $18,000.


62
0:2:12,81 --> 0:2:15,63
You have the option to say,
buy it out for $6,000.


63
0:2:15,63 --> 0:2:18,944
It's always dangerous to cross
that line for these athletes,


64
0:2:18,944 --> 0:2:19,77
you know what I mean?


65
0:2:19,77 --> 0:2:21,79
Especially the urban
skateboard image.


66
0:2:21,79 --> 0:2:25,535
I mean, that-- that could flow
into the cities like nobody's


67
0:2:25,535 --> 0:2:26,96
business, you know
what I mean?


68
0:2:26,96 --> 0:2:28,385
And that's why he gets
paid so well.


69
0:2:28,385 --> 0:2:31,86
That's why he has the-- he's the
featured pro on DC's new


70
0:2:31,86 --> 0:2:33,6
shoe line, you know
what I mean.


71
0:2:33,6 --> 0:2:34,23
OK, great.


72
0:2:34,23 --> 0:2:34,81
Good talking to you.


73
0:2:34,81 --> 0:2:35,74
You take care now.


74
0:2:35,74 --> 0:2:36,696
Bye.


75
0:2:36,696 --> 0:2:38,13
[LAUGHS]


76
0:2:38,13 --> 0:2:38,608
ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: Oh, god.


77
0:2:38,608 --> 0:2:40,42
MALE SPEAKER: What was that?


78
0:2:40,42 --> 0:2:41,86
ROB DYRDEK: Dude, I
just sealed the


79
0:2:41,86 --> 0:2:42,986
deal so gnarly, man.


80
0:2:42,986 --> 0:2:45,45
Like he was just like, well,
I understand that.


81
0:2:45,45 --> 0:2:47,26
If you could please-- if you
can get me that in writing


82
0:2:47,26 --> 0:2:50,66
with a proposal in writing, if
you can explain to me how


83
0:2:50,66 --> 0:2:53,43
coming into this market, what
you need to be, if you could


84
0:2:53,43 --> 0:2:57,302
just explain it to me, I mean,
if we could take it to the


85
0:2:57,302 --> 0:2:58,996
powers that be, I know
we could make


86
0:2:58,996 --> 0:3:1,42
it happen like that.


87
0:3:1,42 --> 0:3:3,55
I was, like, all right.


88
0:3:3,55 --> 0:3:5,882
MALE SPEAKER: Do you remember
the name you told him?


89
0:3:5,882 --> 0:3:6,35
ROB DYRDEK: (LAUGHING) Oh.


90
0:3:6,35 --> 0:3:7,9
Mike Johnson?


91
0:3:7,9 --> 0:3:8,375
MALE SPEAKER: Mark Johnson.


92
0:3:8,375 --> 0:3:11,23
MALE SPEAKER: You better
write that down.


93
0:3:11,23 --> 0:3:12,67
MALE SPEAKER: Freddy
[INAUDIBLE] called.


94
0:3:12,67 --> 0:3:14,11
Whooo!


95
0:3:14,11 --> 0:3:17,52
JOSH KALIS: Now like me
and Dyrdek got AVE on.


96
0:3:17,52 --> 0:3:23,48
I saw AVE's Wheels of Fortune
and was like, holy fuck, dude.


97
0:3:23,48 --> 0:3:26,96
This kid gnarly crooked grinded
and picnic tables on


98
0:3:26,96 --> 0:3:28,9
like flat ground, you know?


99
0:3:28,9 --> 0:3:29,36
And switch front crooking.


100
0:3:29,36 --> 0:3:30,71
And I mean, he was gnarly.


101
0:3:30,71 --> 0:3:35,38
He was doing all the tricks that
I either was doing, to a


102
0:3:35,38 --> 0:3:38,89
gnarlier bigger level, or that
I wanted to do, and he was


103
0:3:38,89 --> 0:3:40,52
already on this crazy
other level.


104
0:3:40,52 --> 0:3:42,24
And I was just like, fuck.


105
0:3:42,24 --> 0:3:43,87
AVE was so stoked.


106
0:3:43,87 --> 0:3:47,95
Well, I feel like the Workshop
was always known to not have


107
0:3:47,95 --> 0:3:49,51
people living by each other.


108
0:3:49,51 --> 0:3:52,49
But everyone clicked, and
everyone got along.


109
0:3:52,49 --> 0:3:54,72
And when we hung out or went
on a road trip, or like--


110
0:3:54,72 --> 0:3:56,423
I mean, it was mad fun.


111
0:3:56,423 --> 0:4:1,626
[PLAYING "HEART AND SOUL"]


112
0:4:1,626 --> 0:4:3,87
JOSH KALIS: But it's not
as personal anymore.


113
0:4:3,87 --> 0:4:5,275
It's not as friendly.


114
0:4:5,275 --> 0:4:6,51
You know what I mean?


115
0:4:6,51 --> 0:4:8,5
Shit, I'll go on a road trip and
not even know who to talk


116
0:4:8,5 --> 0:4:9,88
to anymore.


117
0:4:9,88 --> 0:4:11,24
It's like, fuck, man.


118
0:4:11,24 --> 0:4:12,49
Become a lone wolf.


119
0:4:12,49 --> 0:4:14,55
ROB DYRDEK: I understood
his position.


120
0:4:14,55 --> 0:4:19,279
When that new tier was sort of
being rebuilt again, he just


121
0:4:19,279 --> 0:4:21,19
lost his voice in that.


122
0:4:21,19 --> 0:4:25,83
And I think for him as he
became more and more


123
0:4:25,83 --> 0:4:32,17
alienated, so to speak, it just
started to wear him out.


124
0:4:32,17 --> 0:4:34,75
PATRICK O'DELL: Did you disagree
with anything that


125
0:4:34,75 --> 0:4:37,65
Dill or Bill said in
Dylan's episode?


126
0:4:37,65 --> 0:4:39,52
JOSH KALIS: Well I-- he
used the wrong word.


127
0:4:39,52 --> 0:4:41,95
Because up-river is usually
like, fucking, in jail.


128
0:4:41,95 --> 0:4:43,22
PATRICK O'DELL: Upstream.


129
0:4:43,22 --> 0:4:43,71
JOSH KALIS: OK.


130
0:4:43,71 --> 0:4:44,32
Yeah.


131
0:4:44,32 --> 0:4:46,14
Upstream, downstream.


132
0:4:46,14 --> 0:4:50,525
But I don't know what he
was getting at, you


133
0:4:50,525 --> 0:4:50,91
know what I'm saying?


134
0:4:50,91 --> 0:4:55,27
Because he said when I left the
Workshop, it became less


135
0:4:55,27 --> 0:4:58,522
upstream, or up-river.


136
0:4:58,522 --> 0:5:2,3
To tell you the truth, if
anything, I think it's a


137
0:5:2,3 --> 0:5:4,765
little bit more uptight now.


138
0:5:4,765 --> 0:5:5,97
You know what I mean?


139
0:5:5,97 --> 0:5:9,15
And I'm not really like
the uptight dude.


140
0:5:9,15 --> 0:5:14,23
And so I left a company that
I thought was getting more


141
0:5:14,23 --> 0:5:20,62
uptight, more focused on fashion
and accessories.


142
0:5:20,62 --> 0:5:23,32
And I'm just not really
a part of that.


143
0:5:23,32 --> 0:5:24,17
Like, I'm not with that.


144
0:5:24,17 --> 0:5:28,5
Like, you can tell in my video
or in my video part, it's


145
0:5:28,5 --> 0:5:31,31
completely different than
the rest of the video.


146
0:5:31,31 --> 0:5:31,75
They're--


147
0:5:31,75 --> 0:5:35,13
they're going on their way, and
they're like whatever type


148
0:5:35,13 --> 0:5:37,92
of music that those dudes are
going for in that direction.


149
0:5:37,92 --> 0:5:39,44
And just like, that's not me.


150
0:5:39,44 --> 0:5:40,61
You know?


151
0:5:40,61 --> 0:5:42,72
ROB DYRDEK: It's so funny 'cause
I call Dill, and I'm


152
0:5:42,72 --> 0:5:45,63
like, I'm like, look, dude.


153
0:5:45,63 --> 0:5:48,66
He's like, what, dude,
I don't even like--


154
0:5:48,66 --> 0:5:51,85
And I'm like, dude, what
does up-river mean?


155
0:5:51,85 --> 0:5:53,81
And I'm like how can you?


156
0:5:53,81 --> 0:5:56,46
He's like, you know, where
the fishing's good.


157
0:5:56,46 --> 0:5:59,7
And I'm like, how are
you gonna put--


158
0:5:59,7 --> 0:6:0,28
and my whole thing is this.


159
0:6:0,28 --> 0:6:2,16
It's Dill--


160
0:6:2,16 --> 0:6:3,99
Dill's just spouting off.


161
0:6:3,99 --> 0:6:6,98
Me and Barra are up-river,
you know what I'm saying?


162
0:6:6,98 --> 0:6:8,32
Kalis is not.


163
0:6:8,32 --> 0:6:10,43
It's like, and even like--


164
0:6:10,43 --> 0:6:12,23
even like--


165
0:6:12,23 --> 0:6:14,64
telling Kalis, like god, it
was just him kind of--


166
0:6:14,64 --> 0:6:17,28
like, OK, your name got
accidentally put in there.


167
0:6:17,28 --> 0:6:20,46
It's like, it's like, me
and Barra are like


168
0:6:20,46 --> 0:6:22,4
TV and fucking website.


169
0:6:22,4 --> 0:6:25,36
Like me and Barra are like so
far gone, like it makes sense


170
0:6:25,36 --> 0:6:26,11
for being up-river.


171
0:6:26,11 --> 0:6:28,21
Like he just accidentally
put your name in there.


172
0:6:28,21 --> 0:6:30,98
It doesn't feel like
shit-talking, you know what


173
0:6:30,98 --> 0:6:31,56
I'm saying?


174
0:6:31,56 --> 0:6:34,66
It's just Kalis doesn't
want to hear his name.


175
0:6:34,66 --> 0:6:37,25
You don't want to be lumped in
with me and Barra, you know


176
0:6:37,25 --> 0:6:37,5
what I'm saying?


177
0:6:37,5 --> 0:6:39,28
You don't.


178
0:6:39,28 --> 0:6:42,12
If you were fringe, close
to me and Barra, maybe.


179
0:6:42,12 --> 0:6:46,66
But like, he's a purist.


180
0:6:46,66 --> 0:6:50,16
Our problem with Kalis, DC
Video, Alien Video you name it


181
0:6:50,16 --> 0:6:55,11
video, he's done a year before
everybody, like crying about


182
0:6:55,11 --> 0:6:57,47
like, where, deadline's coming
and we're losing our minds


183
0:6:57,47 --> 0:6:59,53
paranoid, like freaked
out, like hopefully


184
0:6:59,53 --> 0:7:0,81
we push this thing.


185
0:7:0,81 --> 0:7:4,66
And he's got nine minutes of
footage, and he's mad about


186
0:7:4,66 --> 0:7:6,1
like something being cut out.


187
0:7:6,1 --> 0:7:8,3
And he's also a dude
that's on the Slap


188
0:7:8,3 --> 0:7:10,96
message boards all day.


189
0:7:10,96 --> 0:7:12,1
He's--


190
0:7:12,1 --> 0:7:14,78
he's in it, man.


191
0:7:14,78 --> 0:7:17,47
He's in with the shops, he's in
it on the message boards.


192
0:7:17,47 --> 0:7:19,91
He's in it with anyone who
wants to talk about it.


193
0:7:19,91 --> 0:7:20,615
He'll break down.


194
0:7:20,615 --> 0:7:21,87
He'll hate.


195
0:7:21,87 --> 0:7:23,87
He'll come around.


196
0:7:23,87 --> 0:7:26,62
He is a skate rat.


197
0:7:26,62 --> 0:7:28,9



198
0:7:28,9 --> 0:7:31,52
JOSH KALIS: Like I feel like,
shit, I rode for the Workshop


199
0:7:31,52 --> 0:7:34,2
for 13 years.


200
0:7:34,2 --> 0:7:36,58
I know the Alien Workshop.


201
0:7:36,58 --> 0:7:37,71
I know it.


202
0:7:37,71 --> 0:7:39,81
Like, I lived it.


203
0:7:39,81 --> 0:7:41,8
And it just wasn't
there anymore.


204
0:7:41,8 --> 0:7:45,74
To me, I realized that there was
nothing personal about it.


205
0:7:45,74 --> 0:7:49,92
Even though I had a personal
relationship with the owner,


206
0:7:49,92 --> 0:7:55,36
or Dyrdek, there was nothing
personal about my position at


207
0:7:55,36 --> 0:7:56,42
the Workshop.


208
0:7:56,42 --> 0:7:59,91
And I just kind of felt like I
was floating, doing nothing.


209
0:7:59,91 --> 0:8:2,35
There's no personal graphic.


210
0:8:2,35 --> 0:8:4,272
There's none of that stuff.


211
0:8:4,272 --> 0:8:5,76
Kinda over it.


212
0:8:5,76 --> 0:8:9,75
Six months before I quit
Workshop, me and Mark


213
0:8:9,75 --> 0:8:11,85
Appleyard were actually
toying with doing


214
0:8:11,85 --> 0:8:13,74
our own board company.


215
0:8:13,74 --> 0:8:18,29
And I mean, the only thing we
didn't have was a name.


216
0:8:18,29 --> 0:8:21,44
I mean, there was people
ready to do it.


217
0:8:21,44 --> 0:8:24,43
And me and Apple, it was
like, we were gonna


218
0:8:24,43 --> 0:8:25,81
have our own shit.


219
0:8:25,81 --> 0:8:29,84
But then what happened was is
Apples wasn't ready to like


220
0:8:29,84 --> 0:8:31,81
take on the responsibility.


221
0:8:31,81 --> 0:8:33,419
He just didn't want to.


222
0:8:33,419 --> 0:8:34,45
And I--


223
0:8:34,45 --> 0:8:36,8
I get it.


224
0:8:36,8 --> 0:8:37,95
I'll take on responsibility.


225
0:8:37,95 --> 0:8:38,1
I don't give a shit.


226
0:8:38,1 --> 0:8:40,48
But it just ended up
not working out.


227
0:8:40,48 --> 0:8:42,62
So I was talking to Stevie about
it one day, and I was


228
0:8:42,62 --> 0:8:46,2
like, yeah, man, me and Mark
are talking about, been


229
0:8:46,2 --> 0:8:49,54
talking about doing the
company for a while.


230
0:8:49,54 --> 0:8:51,3
But I'm not sure if we're
really going to do it.


231
0:8:51,3 --> 0:8:52,23
So I don't really know--


232
0:8:52,23 --> 0:8:54,1
I don't know what
I want to do.


233
0:8:54,1 --> 0:8:55,925
Like, I don't really want to
ride for the Workshop anymore.


234
0:8:55,925 --> 0:8:59,1



235
0:8:59,1 --> 0:8:59,56
But I don't--


236
0:8:59,56 --> 0:9:0,432
I don't know.


237
0:9:0,432 --> 0:9:1,85
I don't know what to do.


238
0:9:1,85 --> 0:9:4,35
And then that he was
like, damn, yo.


239
0:9:4,35 --> 0:9:5,95
Maybe we should do something.


240
0:9:5,95 --> 0:9:7,28
Blah, blah, blah.


241
0:9:7,28 --> 0:9:10,36
And I was like, actually,
you know what, bro?


242
0:9:10,36 --> 0:9:14,1
Why don't you put a old fucking
original DGK homey


243
0:9:14,1 --> 0:9:16,4
white boy on DGK?


244
0:9:16,4 --> 0:9:17,676
And he was like, who?


245
0:9:17,676 --> 0:9:18,9
I was like, come on, dog.


246
0:9:18,9 --> 0:9:19,44
You know what I'm
talking about.


247
0:9:19,44 --> 0:9:20,24
He was like phhhbbt.


248
0:9:20,24 --> 0:9:21,47
Say the word.


249
0:9:21,47 --> 0:9:22,19
STEVIE WILLIAMS: Let's go.


250
0:9:22,19 --> 0:9:23,85
I was like, that's what
you want to do?


251
0:9:23,85 --> 0:9:24,89
He was like, yeah, fuck it.


252
0:9:24,89 --> 0:9:26,84
I was like, how much you want?


253
0:9:26,84 --> 0:9:28,7
He told me.


254
0:9:28,7 --> 0:9:30,69
And it wasn't even a question.


255
0:9:30,69 --> 0:9:32,2
It was just, let's go.


256
0:9:32,2 --> 0:9:35,59
I thought that was really
something that me and Josh


257
0:9:35,59 --> 0:9:36,98
both deserve.


258
0:9:36,98 --> 0:9:39,51
I think it's really, really cool
on my end, for me to own


259
0:9:39,51 --> 0:9:44,93
a company and have the person
that saved my career skate for


260
0:9:44,93 --> 0:9:46,3
my company.


261
0:9:46,3 --> 0:9:47,81
So I don't really look at
it like it's my company.


262
0:9:47,81 --> 0:9:51,95
I look at it like it's a
situation that was put in


263
0:9:51,95 --> 0:9:55,0
front of us due to
grace of God.


264
0:9:55,0 --> 0:9:56,47
Everybody knows the story.


265
0:9:56,47 --> 0:9:58,54
Everybody know that I
came from shit and


266
0:9:58,54 --> 0:10:0,33
Kalis hooked it up.


267
0:10:0,33 --> 0:10:3,5
And for me to get laughed at
for doing a company that


268
0:10:3,5 --> 0:10:6,92
people said wouldn't work, and
for it to be so successful


269
0:10:6,92 --> 0:10:10,3
that my mentor skates for it?


270
0:10:10,3 --> 0:10:11,23
That's priceless.


271
0:10:11,23 --> 0:10:11,83
It wasn't--


272
0:10:11,83 --> 0:10:14,37
Josh could have said, I
want $20,000 a month.


273
0:10:14,37 --> 0:10:16,78
And it still wouldn't
have mattered.


274
0:10:16,78 --> 0:10:21,89
Because it's a priceless,
epic situation that--


275
0:10:21,89 --> 0:10:22,86
you can't buy that shit.


276
0:10:22,86 --> 0:10:24,3
It's just, it's crazy, yo.


277
0:10:24,3 --> 0:10:26,38
And that's my man.


278
0:10:26,38 --> 0:10:27,53
He got my heart.


279
0:10:27,53 --> 0:10:29,4
Everybody don't get on
the team like that.


280
0:10:29,4 --> 0:10:32,83
And he gets a nice check,
you know what I mean?


281
0:10:32,83 --> 0:10:34,8
So.


282
0:10:34,8 --> 0:10:36,8
PATRICK O'DELL: He reps
it pretty hard.


283
0:10:36,8 --> 0:10:37,49
STEVIE WILLIAMS: Yeah, well,
that's the deal.


284
0:10:37,49 --> 0:10:38,22
It's not so much--


285
0:10:38,22 --> 0:10:39,67
I don't be like, Josh,
you got to--


286
0:10:39,67 --> 0:10:41,84
I still really don't even talk
to Josh that much on the


287
0:10:41,84 --> 0:10:44,7
phone, 'cause he's
like my brother.


288
0:10:44,7 --> 0:10:47,74
But what's I tell people
on the team, I


289
0:10:47,74 --> 0:10:49,52
tell them, like, look.


290
0:10:49,52 --> 0:10:53,5
He's going to show you the
ultimate professionalism.


291
0:10:53,5 --> 0:10:57,53
Josh is the professionalism
of skateboarding.


292
0:10:57,53 --> 0:10:59,99
He knows how to attack
everything.


293
0:10:59,99 --> 0:11:1,51
He knows about this trick.


294
0:11:1,51 --> 0:11:5,5
He knows about every goddamn
thing I don't know about.


295
0:11:5,5 --> 0:11:8,87
But if I'm not on tour and
Amber's on tour, like Marquis


296
0:11:8,87 --> 0:11:13,55
or Duane, or things like that,
they can ask a legend pro like


297
0:11:13,55 --> 0:11:17,83
Kalis how to handle shit, from
counts to tricks to how to


298
0:11:17,83 --> 0:11:19,53
handle demos.


299
0:11:19,53 --> 0:11:23,18
He's a pro to look at, to model
yourself after, doing an


300
0:11:23,18 --> 0:11:24,88
excellent job in your career.


301
0:11:24,88 --> 0:11:27,12
JOSH KALIS: May sound dumb or
old school or something, but


302
0:11:27,12 --> 0:11:30,16
like respect is so
important to me.


303
0:11:30,16 --> 0:11:33,0
All through the '90s, and even
'80s, and I mean it's always


304
0:11:33,0 --> 0:11:36,46
been that you didn't have to
be like physically the best


305
0:11:36,46 --> 0:11:37,61
skateboarder.


306
0:11:37,61 --> 0:11:40,57
Like of course there's always
people who are better and more


307
0:11:40,57 --> 0:11:41,5
consistent or whatever.


308
0:11:41,5 --> 0:11:47,31
But when you build like a form
of respect around you, people


309
0:11:47,31 --> 0:11:48,75
accept you and they
bring that in.


310
0:11:48,75 --> 0:11:52,76
And they want to like
earn your respect.


311
0:11:52,76 --> 0:11:54,1
It's all about respect, man.


312
0:11:54,1 --> 0:11:56,99



313
0:11:56,99 --> 0:12:1,136
PATRICK O'DELL: Tre-bomb, 360
flip, good day or bad day.


314
0:12:1,136 --> 0:12:4,468



315
0:12:4,468 --> 0:12:6,85
Oh!


316
0:12:6,85 --> 0:12:9,3
TED LEE: I mean, it's just crazy
to look back 20 years


317
0:12:9,3 --> 0:12:14,74
and to think, like, Josh is
kind of my friend's kid


318
0:12:14,74 --> 0:12:16,71
brother's friend.


319
0:12:16,71 --> 0:12:18,81
14 and goofy and whatever.


320
0:12:18,81 --> 0:12:21,46
Josh was always like
a really hyper kid.


321
0:12:21,46 --> 0:12:25,5
Like he was jumping off the
walls, like ready to go skate.


322
0:12:25,5 --> 0:12:28,45
Or like so-and-so is here, so
I'm going to go do this.


323
0:12:28,45 --> 0:12:31,48
So you could see kind of that
like cocky, like punk-ass kid


324
0:12:31,48 --> 0:12:32,5
edge or whatever.


325
0:12:32,5 --> 0:12:35,3
I say that in a loving way, but
you know, that's, I think,


326
0:12:35,3 --> 0:12:38,705
one of the reasons Josh
is where he is.


327
0:12:38,705 --> 0:12:42,36
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]


328
0:12:42,36 --> 0:12:43,47
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, Josh.


329
0:12:43,47 --> 0:12:44,7
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, Josh.


330
0:12:44,7 --> 0:12:45,0
MALE SPEAKER: Good job, Josh.


331
0:12:45,0 --> 0:12:46,28
Hey, Josh, be proud
of yourself.


332
0:12:46,28 --> 0:12:47,36
That was great.


333
0:12:47,36 --> 0:12:48,28
MALE SPEAKER: Hey,
be strong, man.


334
0:12:48,28 --> 0:12:50,96
MALE SPEAKER: Do a good
disco maneuver.


335
0:12:50,96 --> 0:12:52,47
TED LEE: And now look at--


336
0:12:52,47 --> 0:12:56,14
not only has Josh stayed
relevant and grown with his


337
0:12:56,14 --> 0:12:59,8
career, but the whole industry
has changed, obviously, so


338
0:12:59,8 --> 0:13:3,57
dramatically and he's really
been able to ride


339
0:13:3,57 --> 0:13:4,82
that and do his thing.


340
0:13:4,82 --> 0:13:5,86
And it's rad, you know?


341
0:13:5,86 --> 0:13:6,58
It's so cool.


342
0:13:6,58 --> 0:13:7,49
I'm proud of him.


343
0:13:7,49 --> 0:13:8,37
So I don't know.


344
0:13:8,37 --> 0:13:8,85
It's funny.


345
0:13:8,85 --> 0:13:9,89
It's like one of those things.


346
0:13:9,89 --> 0:13:13,0
When his career really started
ramping up, and I remember


347
0:13:13,0 --> 0:13:15,98
thinking, like, I hope this
really works for him.


348
0:13:15,98 --> 0:13:18,91
Because he's one of
those guys that--


349
0:13:18,91 --> 0:13:21,62
I mean, it's rad, but I don't
know what else he'd be doing


350
0:13:21,62 --> 0:13:24,775
if he wasn't skating.


351
0:13:24,775 --> 0:13:26,6
PATRICK O'DELL: What do you
think you're going to do--


352
0:13:26,6 --> 0:13:29,24
like how much longer do you
think you'll be a pro or skate


353
0:13:29,24 --> 0:13:30,177
or whatever?


354
0:13:30,177 --> 0:13:32,25
JOSH KALIS: I don't know, man.


355
0:13:32,25 --> 0:13:36,53
I'm definitely not one that
would sit there and milk it.


356
0:13:36,53 --> 0:13:41,89
But I'm definitely not one
that's like ready to stop.


357
0:13:41,89 --> 0:13:42,28
I don't know.


358
0:13:42,28 --> 0:13:44,8
It's kind of tough to think
about, because I've been


359
0:13:44,8 --> 0:13:47,82
living the same lifestyle
for 10, 12 years.


360
0:13:47,82 --> 0:13:50,86
And I'm a high school
dropout, man.


361
0:13:50,86 --> 0:13:57,94
I really don't know what
could take place of


362
0:13:57,94 --> 0:13:59,32
skateboarding for me.


363
0:13:59,32 --> 0:14:0,59
Financially, mentally--


364
0:14:0,59 --> 0:14:2,2
like I really have no idea.


365
0:14:2,2 --> 0:14:3,36
Who knows, man?


366
0:14:3,36 --> 0:14:6,8
Who knows?


367
0:14:6,8 --> 0:14:8,525
I don't know, Patrick.


368
0:14:8,525 --> 0:14:11,99
I ain't even thinking about that
shit right now, buddy.


369
0:14:11,99 --> 0:14:14,71
Fucking sunset is setting.


370
0:14:14,71 --> 0:14:17,88
I'm going to Atlanta tomorrow
to skate in the new DGK


371
0:14:17,88 --> 0:14:19,6
private park, called
The Playground .


372
0:14:19,6 --> 0:14:21,634
And that shit's gonna
be tight.


373
0:14:21,634 --> 0:14:24,13
PATRICK O'DELL: Thanks, Josh.


374
0:14:24,13 --> 0:14:25,49
You wanna head back?


375
0:14:25,49 --> 0:14:26,74
JOSH KALIS: Yeah.


376
0:14:26,74 --> 0:16:26,74
