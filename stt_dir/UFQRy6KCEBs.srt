0:0:8,0 --> 0:0:11,67
Premium car manufacturers have traditionally
stayed away from the hot hatch market, but


2
0:0:11,67 --> 0:0:18,11
that's no longer the case. First of all we've
had this car the BMW M1359 and now AMG have


3
0:0:18,11 --> 0:0:23,34
got in on the act with this, the A45 - with
a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine and four-wheel


4
0:0:23,34 --> 0:0:27,0
drive, it's going to be a stern rival for
the BMW. But which is going to be the most


5
0:0:27,0 --> 0:0:30,96
fun and which is going to be fastest? We'll
let's have an Auto Express track battle to


6
0:0:30,96 --> 0:0:53,559
find out. Okay so we're going to start with
the BMW, reason being is that this car is


7
0:0:53,559 --> 0:0:57,789
the benchmark really, so if the AMG is going
to become the best of the pair it's going


8
0:0:57,789 --> 0:1:0,51
to have to beat this car. We've driven this
car before -in fact we've done a track battle


9
0:1:0,51 --> 0:1:6,11
in it before - and it's really rather special.
Six cylinder engine, rear-wheel drive. The


10
0:1:6,11 --> 0:1:12,7
engine is a real gem, revs to 7000rpm but
peak torque is at just 1300rpm so it's just


11
0:1:12,7 --> 0:1:19,95
got instant power and it's just so silky smooth.
You can have a manual in this car, but we've


12
0:1:19,95 --> 0:1:25,6
got the automatic gearbox. Eight speed, so
it's quite a short ratio, you don't find yourself


13
0:1:25,6 --> 0:1:33,119
using second gear box. It's rear-wheel drive
so that's one area where the Mercedes has


14
0:1:33,119 --> 0:1:38,75
got the advantage. It has less power than
Mercedes but identical torque, it's a little


15
0:1:38,75 --> 0:1:42,96
bit lighter as well. It's going to be really
interesting to see which comes out on top,


16
0:1:42,96 --> 0:1:47,92
it's going to be really close I think. This
is just a joy to drive though, so rear-wheel


17
0:1:47,92 --> 0:1:53,29
drive we can play around with this through
this long corner can start to get it slighting,


18
0:1:53,29 --> 0:1:57,85
massive long oversteer slides - can't do that
in four-wheel drive Mercedes. Obviously that


19
0:1:57,85 --> 0:2:4,67
isn't quick, we're gonna come around now and
start a clean fine lap, to see how fast the


20
0:2:4,67 --> 0:2:12,34
BMW is and see if it's a benchmark the Mercedes
can beat. On the road the BMW's really nice


21
0:2:12,34 --> 0:2:17,51
to drive, great steering really engaging to
drive and good fun on track as well. Time


22
0:2:17,51 --> 0:2:31,12
to concentrate on a lap time. A little bit
of roll in the BMW, not completely tied down


23
0:2:31,12 --> 0:2:35,4
the body. The car is working quite hard, can
feel there's a six-cylinder in there it's


24
0:2:35,4 --> 0:2:43,459
a little bit heavy. When you're being smooth
traction is pretty good, hard on brakes here,


25
0:2:43,459 --> 0:2:55,68
down through the gears. Only need to use third
don't need to use second. Nearly nudging 100mph,


26
0:2:55,68 --> 0:3:7,519
hard on breaks here down to third gear. Hard
on brakes, carry momentum here, try not to


27
0:3:7,519 --> 0:3:19,6
get any oversteer. Little bit of understeer
on the exit, up to fourth. Really worth the


28
0:3:19,6 --> 0:3:51,48
drive, and across the line. Okay so how does
the Mercedes stack up? Well for starters it's


29
0:3:51,48 --> 0:4:0,68
Â£5000 more than the BMW, so that's something
to think about. It's got 40bhp more but same


30
0:4:0,68 --> 0:4:7,26
torque. 2.0-litre turbocharged engine four-wheel
drive. It's got a dual-clutch gearbox so straight


31
0:4:7,26 --> 0:4:18,65
away you notice that... it's quite a fast,
aggressive gearbox. Which is a good thing.


32
0:4:18,65 --> 0:4:24,54
The engine hasn't got the character of the
six-cylinder BMW. You also notice the body


33
0:4:24,54 --> 0:4:30,68
control is really good in the Mercedes. Sits
a bit tighter on the road than the BMW, but


34
0:4:30,68 --> 0:4:38,66
the flip side to that is that the ride is
really stiff. So it's a mixed bag so far.


35
0:4:38,66 --> 0:4:46,19
The big question is: is it going to be faster
on the stopwatch? It's got four-wheel drive,


36
0:4:46,19 --> 0:5:1,2
but it's not permanent. The system senses
when it looses grip and sends power to the


37
0:5:1,2 --> 0:5:22,57
rear. Let's try a lap and see how we get on.
Crisp gear change down to third gear, in long


38
0:5:22,57 --> 0:5:35,49
corners the Mercedes has quite good body control,
little bit of understeer, but helps when changing


39
0:5:35,49 --> 0:5:44,22
direction. As we come up to the corner, hard
on brakes. braking similar in both cars. Little


40
0:5:44,22 --> 0:5:51,6
bit of understeer towards far end of the corner.
Up to fourth gear, hard on the power, similar


41
0:5:51,6 --> 0:5:57,31
top speed here to BMW just nudging 100mph,
down to third. One irritation with Mercedes


42
0:5:57,31 --> 0:6:22,62
you have to wait later before going to downward
gear. Body control is good, nice and tiny


43
0:6:22,62 --> 0:6:29,6
through last through corners. Little bit of
grumble through the brakes, nothing too bad.


44
0:6:29,6 --> 0:6:36,62
Hard on power through exit, and across the
line. I spent the day driving a fantastic


45
0:6:36,62 --> 0:6:41,59
day of performance hatch backs, but which
comes out on top? Well if you want to be fastest


46
0:6:41,59 --> 0:6:45,99
against the stopwatch, with four-wheel drive
and amazing body control, you're gonna need


47
0:6:45,99 --> 0:6:50,68
the Mercedes. But if you want to spend a little
less money - and I think, have more fun - then


48
0:6:50,68 --> 0:8:50,68
you need to choose the BMW.
