###15 HIME HERBERT: Ky's super awesome, obviously, because he
###17 let us stay at his house.
###18 HARVEY FOSTER: You've blown it with that answer!
###19 HIME HERBERT: What are you talking about?
###21 HARVEY FOSTER: Ky's sick because we
###22 can stay at his place?
###23 HIME HERBERT: Well, if you guys rolled
###27 into my parents' town--
###28 HARVEY FOSTER: That's the worst answer
###29 I've ever heard, ever.
###30 HIME HERBERT: My parents would never let you
###31 stay at their house.
###32 HARVEY FOSTER: That was bad.
###32 Cut.
###33 MALE SPEAKER: Ky's sick because we
###34 can stay at his house?
###35 HIME HERBERT: Ky, you know what I mean, right?
###37 KYNAN TAIT: What if I didn't let you stay at the house?
###38 HIME HERBERT: I would still be grateful for your company,
###40 because I think you're an awesome guy.
###42 KYNAN TAIT: OK.
###43 MALE SPEAKER: Little twist, eh, Patrick?
###45 HIME HERBERT: Ky, you could stay at my
###46 house anytime you want--
###47 the whole kit.
###49 
###55 KYNAN TAIT: My parents and my little brother moved to Lareto
###58 a few years ago.
###60 I think for me it's the perfect mix of Mexico.
###65 It's just touristy enough for me where most of the people in
###68 the shops speak enough English where you can get by not
###71 speaking any Spanish.
###73 And it's a well-kept city, it's very quaint.
###79 I love the landscape down there and I love the culture.
###82 I like how laid back it is and their common disregard for
###89 time and the whole way that Westerners live their life.
###95 So Lareto's kind of the perfect mix,
###97 like Southern Baja--
###99 still Mexican, but still enough tourist amenities to
###103 keep a Westerner happy.
###106 BRUCE WILLIAMS: Ready?
###107 KEEGAN SAUDER: Yep.
###108 BRUCE WILLIAMS: OK, this way.
###110 I'm Bruce.
###111 KEEGAN SAUDER: Bruce, Keegan.
###112 BRUCE WILLIAMS: How you doing?
###113 
###117 MALE SPEAKER: What does your brother do?
###119 KYNAN TAIT: He's now a scuba dive instructor, so he's
###123 traveling a lot, too.
###125 He was living in Singapore, now he's living in Mexico.
###128 
###132 HEATH KIRCHART: Look at that bird.
###134 Spread out.
###137 Hey Keegan, we need a hero shot for the video.
###140 
###175 BRUCE WILLIAMS: So they're about 600 pounds or so and
###181 they get a little bit noisy.
###184 We'll be pretty close to them in the water.
###188 You shouldn't be afraid though, they're curious.
###191 They're kind of used to people being around them now.
###194 
###270 KYNAN TAIT: One of those spiny things?
###272 
###277 You can touch them?
###278 Like, they're not--
###280 I have no interest in what's going on under the water.
###283 
###287 And just the feeling of breathing underwater freaks
###289 the hell out of me.
###290 
###293 And I don't care to look at the fish down there.
###297 HEATH KIRCHART: Toys.
###298 KYNAN TAIT: And see these weird alien-looking fish.
###301 
###304 Nothing about that excites me too much.
###307 HEATH KIRCHART: Ew, it's got worms crawling
###308 out of it over here.
###310 
###316 BRUCE WILLIAMS: That's called a brittle star.
###319 KYNAN TAIT: Touch the middle part of him, he's all soft.
###321 HEATH KIRCHART: Oh, is he?
###322 KEEGAN SAUDER: See?
###323 You can feel it sucking on your hand, the middle part.
###326 
###330 BRUCE WILLIAMS: Well, I can tell already after seeing all
###333 of you in the water that none of you are going to sink.
###337 Because you have a positive attitude and a buoyant
###340 personality.
###341 
###344 BRUCE WILLIAMS: That's what you want.
###345 The ideal situation.
###347 
###355 KEEGAN SAUDER: Now we're coming.
###356 
###369 That one hurt a bit.
###371 
###374 HEATH KIRCHART: I want in!
###376 
###381 I can't do it.
###382 
###387 Good luck getting in.
###389 BRUCE WILLIAMS: Come on, have another cigarette.
###391 HEATH KIRCHART: Kick!
###391 Kick!
###393 Kick!
###394 
###400 BRUCE WILLIAMS: And your impression at this time?
###402 
###421 HIME HERBERT: I'm sweating like a baked ham.
###425 
###428 MALE SPEAKER: Was it you that was asking for
###429 a temperature increase?
###430 HIME HERBERT: Yeah, I was asking for
###432 a temperature increases.
###433 Now I would like a temperature decrease.
###436 Just maybe five or six degrees.
###440 BILL BRYANT: Blowing a fuse.
###443 ARTO SAARI: I have a brake light, but I don't have
###445 running lights or a headlight.
###447 It would kind of suck driving at night with no headlight and
###452 sunglasses on.
###453 And couldn't be bothered putting the goggles on because
###456 they don't fit without a helmet.
###457 So I have to just follow these guys just to try to stay as
###460 close as possible to make sure that I see where the road is.
###466 
###476 BILL BRYANT: Here's that.
###480 HIME HERBERT: Oh God, my hands are dirty!
###481 
###484 [BURPS]
###488 Banana, V-8, coffee.
###495 That's delicious.
###497
