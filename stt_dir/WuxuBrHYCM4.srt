1
0:0:9,31 --> 0:0:15,939
Violent winds, driving rain, killer waves.


2
0:0:15,939 --> 0:0:18,464
These are the hallmarks of a hurricane,


3
0:0:18,464 --> 0:0:23,284
Also called cyclons or typhoons,
hurricanes are giant storms


4
0:0:23,284 --> 0:0:25,856
prowling the world's tropical seas.


5
0:0:25,856 --> 0:0:29,551
An average hurricane releases
as much energy in a day


6
0:0:29,551 --> 0:0:34,95
as the explosion of half a million
small atomic bombs.


7
0:0:34,95 --> 0:0:36,49
Hurricanes form in the summer and fall,


8
0:0:36,49 --> 0:0:42,162
when the sun heats vast stretches
of tropical ocean to over 82 degrees.


9
0:0:42,162 --> 0:0:47,407
Warm moist air rises over these
hot spots, creating thunderstorms.


10
0:0:47,407 --> 0:0:51,26
Upper level winds and surface winds
then come together,


11
0:0:51,26 --> 0:0:56,613
forming a circular pattern of clouds,
known as a tropical depression.


12
0:0:56,613 --> 0:1:2,26
When the winds exceed thirty-nine miles
per hour, a tropical storm is developed.


13
0:1:2,26 --> 0:1:8,97
When the winds reach 74 miles per hour,
a hurricane is officially born.


14
0:1:8,97 --> 0:1:12,443
Inside the storm bands of rain
up to three hundred miles long


15
0:1:12,443 --> 0:1:15,626
meet in the eye wall,
the most violent section.


16
0:1:15,626 --> 0:1:20,317
Here winds of up to two hundred
miles per hour spiral upward.


17
0:1:20,317 --> 0:1:24,961
Within the centre of the hurricane,
down droughts of dry air


18
0:1:24,961 --> 0:1:28,846
create a strangely calm area
called 'the eye'.


19
0:1:28,846 --> 0:1:34,343
Fully formed, a hurricane may stretch
over five hundred miles in diameter


20
0:1:34,343 --> 0:1:37,153
(that's a storm nearly the size of Texas)


21
0:1:37,153 --> 0:1:40,507
and reach a height of nine miles,


22
0:1:40,507 --> 0:1:44,95
Most of these storms being
out over the open sea,


23
0:1:44,95 --> 0:1:48,888
but in an average year, two or three
will strike the mainland of North America.


24
0:1:48,888 --> 0:1:52,691
And when they do the damage
can be catastrophic.


25
0:1:52,691 --> 0:1:55,701
Most dangerous is the storm surge,


26
0:1:55,701 --> 0:1:59,301
a wall of water that
sweeps across the coastline


27
0:1:59,301 --> 0:2:2,434
where the hurricane makes landfall.


28
0:2:2,434 --> 0:2:7,72
About forty-five thousand people were
killed by hurricanes in the 20th century,


29
0:2:7,72 --> 0:2:11,358
including some fifteen thousand
in the U.S.


30
0:2:11,358 --> 0:2:14,66
Hurricanes are also costly in dollars.


31
0:2:14,66 --> 0:2:20,987
1992's hurricane Andrew was the most
expensive natural disaster in U.S. history,


32
0:2:20,987 --> 0:2:25,635
causing more than twenty-five billion
dollars worth of damage.


33
0:2:25,635 --> 0:2:31,389
Scientists are searching for better ways
to predict the path of a hurricane.


34
0:2:31,389 --> 0:2:36,934
Special planes called hurricane hunters
fly directly into these monster storms


35
0:2:36,934 --> 0:2:41,477
and drop sensors to measure
wind speed, temperature and air pressure,


36
0:2:41,477 --> 0:2:46,508
providing vital clues to the
hurricane's direction.


37
0:2:46,508 --> 0:2:50,307
New 3D models are also helping
scientists understand


38
0:2:50,307 --> 0:2:52,678
this awesome force of Nature


39
0:2:52,678 --> 0:2:55,768
and provide quicker and
more accurate warnings


40
0:2:55,768 --> 0:4:55,768
to anyone unlucky enough
to be caught in its path.
