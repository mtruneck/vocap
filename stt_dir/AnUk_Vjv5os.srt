0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:5,423



2
0:0:5,423 --> 0:0:9,524
MALE SPEAKER: Do you have
a new year's resolution?


3
0:0:9,524 --> 0:0:38,106



4
0:0:38,106 --> 0:0:38,78
PATRICK O'DELL: Hi.


5
0:0:38,78 --> 0:0:42,17
Welcome back to the Epicly
Later'd Show.


6
0:0:42,17 --> 0:0:44,8
This episode, we have
Kevin "Spanky" Long.


7
0:0:44,8 --> 0:0:46,4
Kevin's skating is really
spontaneous.


8
0:0:46,4 --> 0:0:48,84
I don't think he feels that kind
of pressure that other


9
0:0:48,84 --> 0:0:49,94
skaters feel.


10
0:0:49,94 --> 0:0:52,5
He's going to just ride some
spot and just try something


11
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:53,77
until he lands it.


12
0:0:53,77 --> 0:0:56,69
He's doing a trick because, I
think, he's having fun, and


13
0:0:56,69 --> 0:0:58,9
you can see that in the rest of
his life, too, the way he


14
0:0:58,9 --> 0:1:0,59
lives and stuff.


15
0:1:0,59 --> 0:1:3,252
Everything's just right
now, like everything's


16
0:1:3,252 --> 0:1:5,59
right in the present.


17
0:1:5,59 --> 0:1:9,36
So today, we're going to go into
Spanky's apartment, and


18
0:1:9,36 --> 0:1:12,175
you can see for yourself
how he lives.


19
0:1:12,175 --> 0:1:17,29



20
0:1:17,29 --> 0:1:18,825
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Well, I
was just gonna kind of like


21
0:1:18,825 --> 0:1:25,64
get a couch, maybe some pictures
or something, maybe


22
0:1:25,64 --> 0:1:27,38
get a bed, like a proper bed.


23
0:1:27,38 --> 0:1:28,73
I don't know.


24
0:1:28,73 --> 0:1:30,56
The girls are working on it.


25
0:1:30,56 --> 0:1:32,776
PATRICK O'DELL: Where'd
you get this giraffe?


26
0:1:32,776 --> 0:1:34,67
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG:
I got that from the


27
0:1:34,67 --> 0:1:36,315
Fairfax swap meet.


28
0:1:36,315 --> 0:1:37,505
That's Reginald.


29
0:1:37,505 --> 0:1:38,455
PATRICK O'DELL: What?


30
0:1:38,455 --> 0:1:39,61
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: His name.


31
0:1:39,61 --> 0:1:40,235
PATRICK O'DELL: Reginald?


32
0:1:40,235 --> 0:1:41,485
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Yeah.


33
0:1:41,485 --> 0:1:46,1



34
0:1:46,1 --> 0:1:48,775
This is the original
pizza of trust.


35
0:1:48,775 --> 0:1:50,37
PATRICK O'DELL: How long's
that been there?


36
0:1:50,37 --> 0:1:52,15
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: How long
you think it's been here?


37
0:1:52,15 --> 0:1:53,32
Like month and a half?


38
0:1:53,32 --> 0:1:54,69
FEMALE SPEAKER: Month
and a half.


39
0:1:54,69 --> 0:1:56,5
PATRICK O'DELL: Your dad tries
to give you furniture?


40
0:1:56,5 --> 0:1:58,1
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Yeah.


41
0:1:58,1 --> 0:2:2,2
My dad's like constantly working
on a million different


42
0:2:2,2 --> 0:2:3,13
projects at once.


43
0:2:3,13 --> 0:2:6,46
Like he gets these ideas, and
then he's like, I want an old


44
0:2:6,46 --> 0:2:9,75
bus, and I'm going to make it
all nice, and then we're going


45
0:2:9,75 --> 0:2:13,75
to go on family trips and
stuff with the bus.


46
0:2:13,75 --> 0:2:16,63
But it's like all this kind
of stuff, like that.


47
0:2:16,63 --> 0:2:18,61
It's my great-grandfather's
chair.


48
0:2:18,61 --> 0:2:20,88
He was a barber.


49
0:2:20,88 --> 0:2:23,965
I guess he still has all the
books and stuff that my


50
0:2:23,965 --> 0:2:27,6
great-grandpa had, like with the
styles and cuts, and the


51
0:2:27,6 --> 0:2:28,56
scissors and everything.


52
0:2:28,56 --> 0:2:34,738
But he was afraid that I was
going to spill wine all over


53
0:2:34,738 --> 0:2:36,109
everything.


54
0:2:36,109 --> 0:2:38,96
JON LONG: The revelation
is, I mean, it's just


55
0:2:38,96 --> 0:2:40,9
in the blood, man.


56
0:2:40,9 --> 0:2:42,26
It's something to
do with Irish.


57
0:2:42,26 --> 0:2:46,28
I mean, it's an innate
fuckin' thing.


58
0:2:46,28 --> 0:2:48,59
He's ADD like his old man.


59
0:2:48,59 --> 0:2:51,7
It's just part of it.


60
0:2:51,7 --> 0:2:54,3
They used to put a block of wood
under my chair because I


61
0:2:54,3 --> 0:2:56,3
was so tiny, and they
thought that was


62
0:2:56,3 --> 0:2:57,66
going to calm me down.


63
0:2:57,66 --> 0:2:58,4
No way.


64
0:2:58,4 --> 0:3:2,52
I was frickin' off the wall.


65
0:3:2,52 --> 0:3:3,592
I was--


66
0:3:3,592 --> 0:3:4,8
whew.


67
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:10,7
And so, I would take him to,
like, Safeway, and skate with


68
0:3:10,7 --> 0:3:12,43
JT or his other buddies.


69
0:3:12,43 --> 0:3:14,3
He's going, dad, I got to
land this trick, I got


70
0:3:14,3 --> 0:3:15,6
to land this trick.


71
0:3:15,6 --> 0:3:18,19
Like, that's fine, but mom's
cooking dinner, so


72
0:3:18,19 --> 0:3:19,72
we got to get home.


73
0:3:19,72 --> 0:3:23,13
And he'd just go, I got to land
this trick, and I'd call


74
0:3:23,13 --> 0:3:25,33
home and say, hey, we're going
to be a little late.


75
0:3:25,33 --> 0:3:27,8
And he would sit there
and sweat and work


76
0:3:27,8 --> 0:3:29,82
at doing this trick.


77
0:3:29,82 --> 0:3:32,78
And then he would make the
trick, and then I'm like, OK,


78
0:3:32,78 --> 0:3:35,97
we're out of here, we're going,
you did it, finally.


79
0:3:35,97 --> 0:3:39,35
And he says, I got
to do it again.


80
0:3:39,35 --> 0:3:40,94
And that's Kevin.


81
0:3:40,94 --> 0:3:49,76



82
0:3:49,76 --> 0:3:52,436
PATRICK O'DELL: You got to
tell me what happened.


83
0:3:52,436 --> 0:4:0,1
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Well,
I lost the keys, and my


84
0:4:0,1 --> 0:4:4,73
motorcycle's parked
in front of it.


85
0:4:4,73 --> 0:4:7,305
And I had to get some
shit out, so--


86
0:4:7,305 --> 0:4:9,41
PATRICK O'DELL: How'd
you lose the key?


87
0:4:9,41 --> 0:4:12,7
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Well, the
keys were like in my bag.


88
0:4:12,7 --> 0:4:16,799
I usually carry around a
little bag like this.


89
0:4:16,799 --> 0:4:18,98
PATRICK O'DELL: That's
like your purse?


90
0:4:18,98 --> 0:4:20,14
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG:
Yeah, sort of.


91
0:4:20,14 --> 0:4:23,19
But I mean, it's just a black
bag with my stuff.


92
0:4:23,19 --> 0:4:26,86
PATRICK O'DELL: I mean, what
happened to the keys?


93
0:4:26,86 --> 0:4:28,601
That's a good plan, you know.


94
0:4:28,601 --> 0:4:32,49
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Yeah, it
didn't fail until one of the


95
0:4:32,49 --> 0:4:33,4
bags blew out.


96
0:4:33,4 --> 0:4:36,26
It was like a thinner one like
this, and with those you got


97
0:4:36,26 --> 0:4:38,415
to double bag sometimes.


98
0:4:38,415 --> 0:4:40,2
CHRIS SHONTING: Oh, the
little man purse?


99
0:4:40,2 --> 0:4:42,85
The little deli bag, bodega.


100
0:4:42,85 --> 0:4:45,84
He usually carries it, but then
I've seen him kind of


101
0:4:45,84 --> 0:4:49,49
like progress into strapping
it around his neck.


102
0:4:49,49 --> 0:4:52,14
I guess it's literally like one
of those situations if his


103
0:4:52,14 --> 0:4:55,97
head wasn't screwed on either,
he'd lose that, but now he's


104
0:4:55,97 --> 0:4:57,58
got a bag around his neck.


105
0:4:57,58 --> 0:4:59,9
ATIBA JEFFERSON: If I could pick
a lifestyle like that, I


106
0:4:59,9 --> 0:5:3,76
would go with his, because it's
got be so stress-free.


107
0:5:3,76 --> 0:5:5,88
I mean, think about it,
how many times he


108
0:5:5,88 --> 0:5:7,62
will flake on something.


109
0:5:7,62 --> 0:5:9,68
Spur of the moment, you could
get the dude to go do


110
0:5:9,68 --> 0:5:13,23
something knowing he probably
has prior engagements.


111
0:5:13,23 --> 0:5:16,4
But like, Spanky, let's go jam
at the house, you know


112
0:5:16,4 --> 0:5:19,31
instantly, he's flaking
on someone for dinner.


113
0:5:19,31 --> 0:5:19,93
And that's wha6t's funny.


114
0:5:19,93 --> 0:5:22,79
When you meet someone that's a
little kid, you always picture


115
0:5:22,79 --> 0:5:24,83
them as a little kid.


116
0:5:24,83 --> 0:5:28,19
And I hate to say it, the dude's
22 and he's still a


117
0:5:28,19 --> 0:5:29,754
little kid.


118
0:5:29,754 --> 0:5:32,38
PATRICK O'DELL: How long have
you known Spanky for?


119
0:5:32,38 --> 0:5:33,33
TERRY KENNEDY: Years.


120
0:5:33,33 --> 0:5:36,3
Like, I met him, Paul, Mikey,
all like going to the valley,


121
0:5:36,3 --> 0:5:38,33
so five years.


122
0:5:38,33 --> 0:5:39,84
From knowing him when
he was sponsored.


123
0:5:39,84 --> 0:5:41,16
It was like [INAUDIBLE]


124
0:5:41,16 --> 0:5:42,83
ATIBA JEFFERSON: I totally
remember it.


125
0:5:42,83 --> 0:5:45,21
It was like, I remember
the Gap.


126
0:5:45,21 --> 0:5:46,49
I was shooting photos.


127
0:5:46,49 --> 0:5:51,8
It was that Santa Monica Blue
Gap, the Pawn Gap, and Mikey


128
0:5:51,8 --> 0:5:53,4
Taylor's trying a gnarly flip.


129
0:5:53,4 --> 0:5:55,315
But anyways, there was this kid,
and he's sitting there,


130
0:5:55,315 --> 0:5:57,83
and he's frontside flipping
it, like, good style and


131
0:5:57,83 --> 0:5:58,89
everything.


132
0:5:58,89 --> 0:6:0,91
And I was like, yeah,
what's his name?


133
0:6:0,91 --> 0:6:1,61
And they're like, Spanky.


134
0:6:1,61 --> 0:6:3,416
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG:
He is spaced.


135
0:6:3,416 --> 0:6:4,862
ANDREW REYNOLDS: It's
different now.


136
0:6:4,862 --> 0:6:6,55
Like, now, he's kind
of grown up.


137
0:6:6,55 --> 0:6:7,62
We became really good friends.


138
0:6:7,62 --> 0:6:11,85
But back then, it was, like,
I'm this druggie guy, and


139
0:6:11,85 --> 0:6:14,515
you're like a little kid, so we
really don't have much in


140
0:6:14,515 --> 0:6:16,75
common, you know what I mean?


141
0:6:16,75 --> 0:6:17,23
It was different back then.


142
0:6:17,23 --> 0:6:20,71
JAVIER NUNEZ: Spanky, though,
it's funny how Spanky turned


143
0:6:20,71 --> 0:6:22,16
out, because I'm,
like, how old?


144
0:6:22,16 --> 0:6:24,675
Like I said, I would be smoking,
drinking, and he'd


145
0:6:24,675 --> 0:6:27,335
just be wildin' out, blazin'
bitches, and fuckin', they


146
0:6:27,335 --> 0:6:30,5
would just look at me,
like, oh damn.


147
0:6:30,5 --> 0:6:31,46
Because they wasn't really
doing none of that shit.


148
0:6:31,46 --> 0:6:32,25
They was just young--


149
0:6:32,25 --> 0:6:32,67
PATRICK O'DELL: Spanky
and Paul?


150
0:6:32,67 --> 0:6:34,6
JAVIER NUNEZ: --always talking
about skating.


151
0:6:34,6 --> 0:6:37,61
Yeah, Spanky, Paul, Mikey,
Devon, Cal, all them cats.


152
0:6:37,61 --> 0:6:41,39
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: 6:23 in
the morning, and we've been


153
0:6:41,39 --> 0:6:42,45
skating all night long.


154
0:6:42,45 --> 0:6:44,426
MALE SPEAKER: Hook him up!


155
0:6:44,426 --> 0:6:44,92
Give a little bit.


156
0:6:44,92 --> 0:6:47,65
Oh!


157
0:6:47,65 --> 0:6:50,278
Uh, uh, uh!


158
0:6:50,278 --> 0:6:53,542
MALE SPEAKER: Give him a hug,
give him a tight squeeze.


159
0:6:53,542 --> 0:6:55,47
FEMALE SPEAKER: What's
wrong, you scared?


160
0:6:55,47 --> 0:6:56,916
You a virgin?


161
0:6:56,916 --> 0:6:58,264
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG:
I'm not scared.


162
0:6:58,264 --> 0:7:0,35
JAVIER NUNEZ: I've seen Spanky
in the [INAUDIBLE]


163
0:7:0,35 --> 0:7:1,13
getting twisted.


164
0:7:1,13 --> 0:7:3,58
I'm like, ah, I got you a
drink, what you want?


165
0:7:3,58 --> 0:7:6,86
Because it's funny, just like,
people grow up, you know?


166
0:7:6,86 --> 0:7:9,61
ANDREW REYNOLDS: I guess City
Star's kind of falling apart,


167
0:7:9,61 --> 0:7:12,75
and he had some offers to ride
for Toy Machine or something


168
0:7:12,75 --> 0:7:16,46
like that, and I just kind of
told him, like, you should


169
0:7:16,46 --> 0:7:17,92
just ride for us, you know?


170
0:7:17,92 --> 0:7:19,2
It's way better.


171
0:7:19,2 --> 0:7:21,13
And he knew what was right.


172
0:7:21,13 --> 0:7:22,87
PATRICK O'DELL: You had to
convince him for a while,


173
0:7:22,87 --> 0:7:23,59
though, right?


174
0:7:23,59 --> 0:7:23,95
ANDREW REYNOLDS: Yeah.


175
0:7:23,95 --> 0:7:26,3
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: I was going
on that Baker tour to


176
0:7:26,3 --> 0:7:28,48
Australia, but I wasn't
riding for Baker yet.


177
0:7:28,48 --> 0:7:31,87
I was trying to figure out if
I was going ride for them or


178
0:7:31,87 --> 0:7:32,84
Toy Machine.


179
0:7:32,84 --> 0:7:37,7
Like, the whole time we were
staying at Dustin's house, and


180
0:7:37,7 --> 0:7:41,85
that pretty much pressured me
on the going on Baker, which


181
0:7:41,85 --> 0:7:42,84
I'm glad I did.


182
0:7:42,84 --> 0:7:46,42
But he was just torturing me the
whole time, like, making


183
0:7:46,42 --> 0:7:49,93
me feel really bad for even
questioning riding for Baker.


184
0:7:49,93 --> 0:7:52,24
What the fuck is wrong
with you, man?


185
0:7:52,24 --> 0:7:58,6
Like, you know how Dustin is
just like, you're stayin' in


186
0:7:58,6 --> 0:8:3,39
my house, like, what's
the question here?


187
0:8:3,39 --> 0:8:5,62
Like, you ride for us.


188
0:8:5,62 --> 0:8:7,865
And basically, like, by the end
of it, I heard, like, "you


189
0:8:7,865 --> 0:8:11,82
ride for us" so many times, it
was like, all right, I can't


190
0:8:11,82 --> 0:8:13,54
say no to that.


191
0:8:13,54 --> 0:8:17,4
Especially to a young lad who's
never been on a skate


192
0:8:17,4 --> 0:8:22,17
tour with people he's looked
up to, and he's basically


193
0:8:22,17 --> 0:8:24,432
calling them a fucking
asshole.


194
0:8:24,432 --> 0:8:28,69
ROBIN FLEMING: Yeah he went from
being a baby to being a


195
0:8:28,69 --> 0:8:31,59
full-blown, jaded,
fucking hipster.


196
0:8:31,59 --> 0:8:33,4
But he also doesn't take
this whole thing that


197
0:8:33,4 --> 0:8:34,71
seriously, you know?


198
0:8:34,71 --> 0:8:38,9
He, I think, recognizes it, and
is really grateful, which


199
0:8:38,9 --> 0:8:40,45
is refreshing.


200
0:8:40,45 --> 0:8:43,32
So it's a free life with a lot
of wonderful travel and great


201
0:8:43,32 --> 0:8:47,63
opportunities to hang out with
another amazing bros, and


202
0:8:47,63 --> 0:8:49,99
travel the world with
your friends.


203
0:8:49,99 --> 0:8:51,71
He could lose everything
and he wouldn't know.


204
0:8:51,71 --> 0:8:52,92
He doesn't care.


205
0:8:52,92 --> 0:8:53,97
And that's what's
good about him.


206
0:8:53,97 --> 0:8:55,52
He cares about the
right things.


207
0:8:55,52 --> 0:10:55,52
