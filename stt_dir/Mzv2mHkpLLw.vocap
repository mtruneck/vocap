###0 It's over.
###2 I... I can't believe it.
###6 Listen, Richard, we had a great time.
###8 Maybe I even loved you but times change.
###11 <i>I've got to think about me, about my life.</i>
###14 The Guardian want me to write this pop column.
###17 I'm going to Fuji to interview the Fugees, Maui for Bowie, Malaga for the Gallaghers.
###22 I'm going to be meeting new people.
###24 'I just don't think I'll have time for you.'
###27 I'm sorry but I think this is best for both of us.
###29 'In the long run you'll thank me.'
###32 'I'm meeting loads of new people and that doesn't leave any room in my life for you.'
###37 'It's over, Daisy.'
###39 It's over... I can't...
###43 I can't believe it.
###70 Rich has finished with me.
###74 It's hardly surprising. You were getting off with people behind his back.
###78 How come he finished with you ?
###80 Cos I was getting off with people behind his back.
###83 - How did he find out ? - Well, I told him. Y'know...
###87 You... You told me to tell him.
###90 You said it would clear the air, you know.
###93 Strengthen our relationship.
###95 - I didn't mean it ! - Oh, you're evil.
###99 I'm not the deceiver here. I'm not the cheating harpy !
###103 You're so damaged.
###105 Just cos Sarah hurt you, you're wreaking your petty vengeance on womankind.
###111 Yes.
###112 Yes.
###114 And I'd do it again, I tell you ! I'd do it again in an instant !
###127 Sorry. Sorry. So, um,...
###130 Are you OK ?
###132 Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, I s'pose. I mean...
###137 It was inevitable really. Neither of us were giving it the time it deserved.
###142 It was... It was my fault.
###144 I just... I feel...
###146 - Tim ! - What ? You said you were fine.
###156 Brian ?
###159 Brian ?
###164 Brian ?
###180 Er, no ! Johnny !
###184 Agh ! Er...
###187 Oh...  !
###189 Help me, I'm stuck.
###191 "Why should I ?" this, "Why should I ?" that !
###193 Why don't you start taking some responsibility in your life ?
###197 Leave me alone !
###201 Don't think I'm going to tidy it ! It'll remain in that state till you return !
###205 <i>That's if you return. Quite frankly, I don't give two shits if you come back or not !</i>
###211 Ooh ! Hello, kitten. Fancy a dab of Rioja ?
###215 Oh, just a splash.
###225 - Can I borrow a tea bag ? - Only if you bring it back.
###228 You can have a tea bag, Brian, you can't borrow one.
###233 What are you playing ?
###235 Tomb Raider III.
###237 She's drowning.
###239 Yeah.
###241 - Is that the point of the game ? - Depends what mood you're in, really.
###245 What sort of mood you in, then ?
###246 Well, I just got a letter from my ex-girlfriend, three months late,
###250 explaining why she dumped me.
###252 It was full of "You'll always be special" and "I'll always love you" platitudes
###255 designed to make me feel better while appeasing her sense of guilt
###259 for running off with a slimy City boy called Duane and destroying my faith in everything.
###264 - So it didn't really work, then ? - No, it made me wanna drown things !
###272 You've got some paint on you.
###274 It's a literal tribute to the self-reflexivity of Rembrandt.
###278 - Did he like it ? - He's dead.
###281 Bloody hell, that really backfired.
###288 Tell me all about it, kitten.
###291 Split up with my boyfriend.
###294 Oh, well,... I can't say I'm surprised.
###297 I heard Tim shouting at you a couple of nights ago, I was shocked.
###301 - What ? - "You stupid cow." Something about a key.
###306 "You can't shoot straight, you big-titted bitch."
###309 No... No, no, that was Lara Croft.
###313 - Well, it sounded like Tim. - No, it was Tim.
###315 He was talking to Lara Croft, a video-game character. He gets very frustrated.
###321 Is that what the problem was ?
###323 - What do you mean ? - Is that why you split, he's got no patience ?
###329 <i>Shit !</i>
###332 "If we pretend we're a couple, this flat could be ours."
###336 "It's madness ! It'll never work !"
###338 "Trust me, Tim, she'll never find out."
###342 Trust me, Tim, she'll never find out.
###344 Shut up !
###345 Think ! Think, think !
###347 Think. I'm thinking...
###350 Could Tim and I, could we have... Could we have...
###353 There, right in front of you !
###355 - a plate ? - Dog !
###357 - A dog ! - Yeah, good one( !)
###363 <i>- A dog ? - A dog. A dog,</i>
###367 Cos... if we had a dog,
###369 then it would help us stay together because it would be like having a child,
###374 only hairier, smaller, wilder, quicker, smellier.
###377 I don't see why not.
###380 Well,... good. I've always wanted a dog actually.
###385 All right, mate, yeah. No, I'm really looking forward to it.
###389 We're going to kick some serious ass, mofo.
###393 Yeah, all right, I'll see you later. Over and out.
###403 Who was that ?
###405 It was Mike. We're going paintballing later.
###407 - I thought he was banned ? - No, only for six months.
###410 How does that poor accountant feel about it ?
###416 I dunno.
###420 - What you doing ? ! - Marsha says that we can have a dog.
###423 - What ? ! - We can have a dog ! Isn't that great ?
###430 Stop it ! What d'you want a dog for, you'll only end up seeing other dogs on the side ?
###435 Don't you want to get a dog ?
###437 - No. - Why not ? What are you frightened of ?
###440 I'm not frightened of anything, why would I be frightened ?
###443 (Roobarb and Custard Theme)
###458 You're scared of them, aren't you ?
###460 - No. - Yes, you are.
###463 All right, I had a minor phobia when I was a kid.
###465 - How minor ? - I had to have counselling.
###468 Really ? Sorry.
###470 She said I had canophobia. I thought "Great, now I'm frightened of bamboo too."
###475 - How many times did you go ? - Three or four.
###478 It started to work, you know.
###480 She said I had as much chance of being struck by lightning
###483 as I had of being bitten by a dog.
###486 So... what's the problem ?
###488 Well, I was leaving the practice one day, feeling really well-adjusted and happy,
###492 <i>and this fucking great Alsatian came haring down the road towards me,</i>
###495 jaws slung with bloody slaver, eyes lit by the fires of Hades' eternal damned kingdom.
###500 It leapt into the air,
###501 I remember thinking "This is it, I'm seven years old and this is the end."
###505 Fortunately, Lady Luck was smiling at me that day.
###508 - What happened ? - I got struck by lightning.
###511 - What ? ! - It hurt but it scared the shit out of the dog.
###514 <i>- Now you're scared of dogs and lightning ? - And bamboo.</i>
###520 It's funny, really.
###522 I always really wanted a dog when I was... little.
###525 But I wasn't allowed one.
###527 Really ?
###532 Play with me !
###535 Oh, please play with me, please !
###540 I don't know, Daisy.
###542 Look, I know I've sprung this on you, you know ?
###545 If you don't like it, I'll understand. But...
###550 I really need this, you know ?
###552 I mean,... I'll do everything for it, you know ?
###557 I'll feed it and I'll walk it and I'II... I'll change its little hutch.
###562 And if you still don't like it, then, well,...
###565 we'll kill it.
###570 - All right. - Wahoo !
###572 - But not a big one. - All right. Sorry !
###575 Sorry, sorry. It could be good for you, it could be the turning point.
###578 It might help you conquer your fear.
###580 Stop trying to get your own way
###583 by turning everything into a psychodrama that somehow benefits me, OK ?
###586 I am my own person. I will deal with my problems in whatever way I see fit.
###591 Aagghh ! Get away from me !
###593 <i> ? Heads and tails, heads and tails, heads and tails</i>
###596 ? Heads and tails, heads and tails, heads and tails
###602 I can't believe you brought me here.
###604 - It's great, isn't it ? - It smells.
###607 <i>- Twist ! - It smells,</i>
###609 - Hi ! - Hello.
###611 I'm Daisy Steiner, this is my friend, Twist.
###614 - Twist. - Mm. My parents were hippies.
###617 I see. What can I do for you ?
###621 <i>- We'd like to buy a dog. - You'd like to buy a dog.</i>
###623 Yes, I'd like to buy a dog.
###626 Yes, erm... there.
###629 Have you owned a dog before ?
###632 Mm,... sort of.
###634 Sort of ?
###636 (Animal Magic Theme)
###638 Come on, boy !
###642 No.
###645 Now, I want you to think very carefully before you choose a dog.
###649 Can I afford to keep it ? Will I be able to take it for walks twice a day, if not more ?
###655 Can I give it a secure, loving home ?
###659 Um,...
###661 yes.
###670 OK, number one, don't eat the paintballs.
###674 Number two, this is just a game.
###676 If you take it too seriously, you're only gonna be hurting yourself.
###679 It's not war,
###681 it's just an exercise in teamwork and tactics.
###684 <i>You go too far, you will get banned.</i>
###687 Eh !
###689 Groovy !
###691 Shit.
###699 He's been with us a while now.
###702 It's his last day here.
###704 Why, somebody bought him ?
###707 Dogs only stay with us for a limited period.
###709 - Where do they go after that ? - Heaven ?
###713 A gay club ? !
###716 No, Miss Steiner. We put them down.
###719 All of them.
###721 No !
###725 No ! No ! No !
###728 Come on, Colin, we're taking you away from this place !
###731 - Colin ? - That's what I called my box.
###746 Hi, Dom, yeah. This is Duane Benzie.
###750 This is Duane Benzie. How you doing ?
###755 (Baywatch Theme)
###778 Tim, your girlfriend's very beautiful.
###783 (Psycho Theme)
###786 Tim, hi. I didn't expect to see you here.
###789 You never struck me as the outdoor type.
###792 What ?
###793 That reminds me. You left some stuff at the flat.
###796 Well, I think it's your stuff.
###799 The bag was full of comics and toys.
###802 I was thinking maybe I'd drop it round in the car, save you the trip.
###806 You stole my girlfriend.
###809 Tim, now come on.
###812 I didn't want it to be like this.
###814 It wasn't meant to be personal. You don't choose who you fall in love with.
###818 When you get that feeling, it's like...
###820 - Sexual. - Like a force beyond your control.
###825 You know what they say about love and war ?
###827 Yeah, one involves a lot of physical and psychological pain and the other one's war.
###832 Talking of which, what team are you on, A or B ?
###834 Er, we're B.
###838 Me too. Looks like we'll be fighting side by side.
###842 Who knows, maybe that's what we need.
###851 Later.
###855 I've rehearsed that moment a thousand times.
###858 - Is that the first time you've seen him since... - Yes.
###861 I think I was pretty cool.
###863 I could have flown off the handle, smashed his face in, set fire to him, but I didn't.
###867 - What will you do when you see him next ? - I'm gonna set fire to him.
###871 Hello ! Hello ! Hello !
###874 Ahh ! Now, you stay there ! You stay there !
###878 Mummy's going to make a cup of tea.
###881 Ahh ! We're gonna be best friends. We're gonna have such fun.
###885 Ahh ! Do you want something to eat ? - Yes, please.
###889 Where is it, then ?
###891 The little dog ?
###897 The bandanna, isn't it ? It makes me look stupid.
###899 - Ahh ! - Do you want me to take it off ?
###902 - C-Colin. - No, Daisy, it's Brian.
###906 I think you're sitting on my dog.
###910 Oh, my God.
###914 Look, I'll count to three...
###917 and then stand up.
###919 - OK ? - I can't watch.
###922 One,...
###924 two,...
###929 three.
###930 Go ! Go ! Go !
###942 - The flag's to the northwest. - How do you know ?
###945 I've just seen it.
###946 - Oh, this is so exciting ! - Is this your first time, kid ?
###949 - I'm 36. - Is this your first time, old man ?
###951 Yeah. I've always fancied myself as a bit of a soldier.
###954 - I've always fancied myself. - I've always fancied you.
###956 Not here.
###957 - Have you ever done this before ? - You could say that.
###959 What do you mean ?
###960 Let's just say the last time I was in this situation, I wasn't using a paintball gun.
###965 You've seen combat ? Where ?
###967 Erm,... on the television.
###969 You said the last time you were in this situation you didn't use a paintball gun.
###973 - He didn't. - What did you use ?
###975 It was a big stick.
###977 - I'm going for the flag. - You shouldn't do that.
###979 We're deep in enemy territory, we've got to choose our moment carefully.
###982 <i>This place is swarming with A's, they're not just in the jungle, they are the jungle.</i>
###986 What do you think this is, Vietnam ?
###994 Yeah.
###1002 Son of a bitch !
###1004 He didn't mean it ! He didn't mean it ! You didn't mean it.
###1008 Say "I didn't mean it, Colin."
###1011 - I didn't mean it, Colin. - No, like I said it.
###1015 I didn't mean it, Colin.
###1017 There. Yes, good boy !
###1020 He's beautiful.
###1022 Reminds me of my own dog, Pompom.
###1024 - I didn't know you had a dog. - As a child, yeah.
###1027 Used to spend hours playing together in the garden.
###1030 I'd dress him up in period costumes and take amusing photographs.
###1034 Loved him so much.
###1036 It was tragic, really.
###1039 Why ?
###1040 One day we were playing in the street,
###1042 I was taking some pictures of him dressed as an Elizabethan merchant.
###1048 Suddenly, something caught his eye.
###1051 Maybe it was a stray tomcat
###1054 or a brightly coloured ball bouncing out of sight,
###1057 or maybe the stick I threw.
###1060 He ran out into the main road,
###1064 exploded under an articulated lorry.
###1067 He blew up ?
###1069 No, the weight of the truck on his frail body burst him like a cheap party balloon,
###1075 sending his ruff forty feet into the air.
###1081 There, you see ?
###1084 Such vibrant colours.
###1089 That paintball was meant for me, he's made this personal.
###1093 He made it personal when he slept with your girlfriend.
###1095 Now he's made it more personal.
###1097 Doesn't get more personal than sleeping with your girlfriend.
###1099 For Christ's sake, Mike !
###1100 Have you ever considered thinking about what you're gonna say before you say it ?
###1103 Perhaps you could set up a checkpoint to vet your thoughts for insensitivity.
###1107 You hate me. You're only going out with me cos of what happened when we were little.
###1111 Oh !
###1116 <i>Mike !</i>
###1118 Mike ?
###1122 Mike !
###1125 You know, Daisy, this is gonna be a big responsibility.
###1129 Dogs are like kids: want, want, want.
###1132 He is a little life.
###1136 He has needs.
###1140 I know, Marsha, I do, I really do.
###1143 I'm not just gonna discard him as soon as he's served his purpose.
###1147 He's a living thing, he's not just some kind of novelty toy.
###1151 Come on, little Colin, dance for me !
###1154 Ha, ha, ha ! Dance !
###1157 Yes, come on, Colin, dance, dance !
###1160 Dance, dance, dance, dance...
###1163 - Oh ! - Dance for me ! Dance !
###1167 - Dance ! - Ha ! Ha ! Ha !
###1170 Mike.
###1176 Mike.
###1180 Mike.
###1184 Mike.
###1191 Saved by the bell.
###1195 - Aren't you gonna answer that ? - I've got an answering service.
###1198 <i>- You've got an answer for everything. - I can't believe you just said that.</i>
###1203 Neither can...
###1205 Neither can I.
###1207 Tim, firing these guns at such close range is very dangerous.
###1211 - You were just about to shoot me. - In the back of the head, yeah.
###1214 In the face, it's a lot different.
###1217 Look, if we're gonna do this, let's at least be sporting about it.
###1223 What do you say, 20 paces ?
###1227 - OK. - OK.
###1240 Ha !
###1244 Oh.
###1253 Ha, ha, ha.
###1254 You see, Tim,
###1256 that's the difference between you and I.
###1261 Organisation.
###1263 Careful thinking.
###1266 Forward planning.
###1268 That is why I sleep in the arms of a beautiful woman
###1271 and you spend your evenings alone in your bedsit.
###1276 With cheap porn.
###1279 Timmmmy !
###1297 It's not a bedsit.
###1299 It's a flat.
###1302 Aarrgghh !
###1303 Yes !
###1305 No, Mike ! Mike !
###1308 Mike ! Oh, Jesus, no !
###1311 Medic !
###1314 Is that you, Tim ?
###1316 I'm here, man, just hold on, hold on !
###1318 I'm tired, Tim.
###1320 Just, er... Everything's gonna be fine, I promise.
###1325 I'm sorry I said those things, I just... I wasn't thinking straight.
###1329 I can say pretty stupid things myself, sometimes.
###1332 Oh, Mike, I'm the stupid one, I've always been the stupid one.
###1335 What you laughing at ?
###1338 I guess I got to be the hero after all.
###1341 Yeah, I guess you did.
###1344 I've gotta... I've gotta sleep.
###1346 No, no, Mike, stay with me !
###1348 - I'm so tired. - No, Mike !
###1351 - Bye, old friend. - No, Mike !
###1361 No !
###1364 - I really enjoyed that today. - Me too.
###1367 - You always enjoy it. - I enjoyed it more than usual.
###1373 I feel cleansed. It's been a really good day.
###1375 That, my friend, is the beauty of simulated violence.
###1379 Let's pick up Daisy and go down the pub. I haven't got a care in the world.
###1383 Hey, viano tormenty.
###1387 What did you say ?
###1389 I said there's a storm coming.
