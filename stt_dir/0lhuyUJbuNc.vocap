###0 STEVE SPANGLER: So I bet you think this is the part of the
###1 show where I'm going to say, don't try these
###3 experiments at home.
###4 And you're right.
###5 Except there is one experiment we want you to try.
###8 Just look for the graphic that's right here
###9 that says try it.
###10 That's your signal that you can try that
###12 experiment at home.
###13 Everything else, off limits.
###15 Look.
###15 I've already given you homework, and the show hasn't
###17 even started.
###17 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###26 STEVE SPANGLER: I'm fascinated with Newton's cradle.
###29 But then, again, I'm easily amused.
###32 It's the coolest demonstration toy because it teaches the
###36 laws of conservation of momentum and the
###39 conservation of energy.
###42 Pendulums are just cool.
###44 As much as we'd like to think that Isaac Newton sat around
###46 and played with this toy, it was actually invented by an
###48 English actor by the name of Simon Prebble in 1967.
###53 He named it after Newton because it demonstrates
###56 Newton's laws of motion.
###58 What I'm really looking for is, instead
###60 of making it bigger--
###62 that seems to be what everybody wants to do
###63 nowadays, is to do it with something
###65 that's bigger and bigger.
###66 I remember, years ago, there was a science experiment in a
###71 book called, Scientific Amusements that talked about
###74 the swing and the transfer of energy from a pendulum.
###78 It almost looked like mind control.
###81 That's what I think I want to do is to mess with people in
###84 our office today and see if I can convince them that I can
###86 control or they can control an object with just their mind.
###90 When in fact, it's all cleverly disguised here in the
###94 swing of a pendulum.
###96 For now, I'm going to keep playing with this.
###100 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###102 STEVE SPANGLER: You know, they say the old is forever new.
###105 And it's absolutely right.
###106 If you want inspiration, you turn to some
###107 of these old books.
###109 This is Scientific Amusements, about 1870 or so, adapted from
###114 Professor CG Knott.
###116 What I'm looking at here is, as you're thumbing through it,
###118 there are all these old materials.
###120 But I remember this thing called a coupled pendulum.
###122 It was actually a swinging pendulum.
###125 You can see here that they actually used
###127 eggs for some reason.
###129 And the eggs would swing back and forth.
###131 I want to build this because, if you do it right, you can't
###134 really see the science behind it, the secret.
###137 And you can make somebody think that they're actually
###139 controlling an object with their mind.
###141 We'll just use some modern day materials, and
###143 we should be set.
###144 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###144 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, here's everything you're going
###146 to need, using simple household materials.
###149 We're going to start with this cord.
###151 And it calls for about 36 inches, so about 100
###155 centimeters of the cord here.
###157 So that will be our main piece.
###159 And then the two pendulum pieces that are going to hang
###162 down have to be exactly equal.
###164 And so, in this particular case, we're going to go for
###166 about 60 centimeters, which is approximately 24 inches.
###170 And all of this is going to have to be tweaked a little
###173 bit, I think, as we're doing it.
###175 But we just want pieces that are identical in every way, so
###181 that the pendulum, when it swings back and forth, the
###185 energy from one is the same.
###187 And we transfer it to the other one as well.
###188 So we have to keep absolutely everything the same.
###190 So we need those two pieces.
###192 And now, instead of hanging something like a jewel or
###196 something ornate, I thought just these soda
###198 cans would be fine.
###199 And I can't just do the soda cans, so I emptied them out,
###202 washed them out and added the same amount of
###204 water to each one.
###205 So we're looking at about 175 milliliters in each one.
###210 It doesn't really matter.
###211 I'm just showing you what I'm doing for this if you're
###213 trying to replicate it exactly the way that I'm doing it,
###216 hoping that it works.
###217 So that's the set up.
###218 Now we just have to tie everything together and see if
###220 we can get this system in place.
###222 
###225 There you go.
###226 So I just need to make sure that the cord is the same on
###230 this one as it is this one, got it so this is in place
###236 here, and be sure that this one looks exactly the same by
###243 using the same amount of cord, so that will be perfect.
###248 OK?
###249 And now we need to tie both of these onto this main one here.
###254 And I'm going to be able to move them around.
###256 I just want to be able to put some knots in them, so that
###258 the cord stays and that I'm, again, using the same amount
###263 of cord on each one.
###265 
###271 And now we just need to hook them onto something.
###273 It has to be extremely steady, because I don't want that
###276 other structure moving.
###277 So we're going to go tie it around something or use these
###280 super strong magnets that we have here to hold it in place.
###284 So I'll use these neodymium magnets and
###287 put them on the ends.
###287 Hold them in place.
###289 And we should be set.
###290 Well, here's our pendulum system, right?
###292 Both cans are equal in their weight.
###295 The cords attached to the top are equal in their length.
###297 And you can see how it's attached up here,
###299 and it can't move.
###300 I'm just using these super strong magnets
###302 to hold it in place.
###303 All right, so if we swing both of them, it'd be just like
###305 swinging a kid at the playground.
###307 It just moves back and forth.
###309 You know, when you push a kid and you push him just at the
###311 right moment, you can add some energy to it
###314 like we're doing here.
###315 Here's what we want to do with this experiment, though.
###317 The book says that you start with one can.
###320 So let's just say we pick the Coke.
###322 You pull back.
###322 And you move the one can.
###324 As you start that in motion, the energy is actually
###326 transferred to the other can.
###327 And now both of them are in motion.
###329 But now you're supposed to focus on the first one here.
###331 Focus on the Coke.
###332 You notice how it stops.
###334 And then it let's go.
###336 And now refocus your energy to the Diet Coke.
###338 Look at this.
###341 And then it moves.
###341 So literally, these two swinging bodies are
###344 transferring energy from one to the next.
###347 So I think, if you do it correctly, you might be able
###349 to convince somebody that they could slow it
###351 down with their mind.
###352 Watch this.
###352 Slow it down.
###353 Slow it down.
###353 Slow it down.
###354 And it keeps moving.
###356 So it's really good, after the first or
###357 second one that's there.
###358 Transfer your energy over to the Coke.
###362 It's pretty cool.
###363 Regardless if you can fool your friends or not, it's a
###365 very, very cool pendulum kind of trick with the transfer of
###369 energy from one pendulum to the next.
###371 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###372 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, everybody, get ready.
###375 I'm going to allow you to control an
###376 object with your mind.
###378 This is going to be great.
###379 You're going to really like it.
###381 Don't worry about us.
###383 We're just going to be rigging something.
###384 Don't worry, all right?
###386 This is perfectly fine.
###387 
###389 That's really good.
###391 
###393 Hey, Zarah, come here.
###394 ZARAH BROWN: Oh, but I'm just afraid I have to work.
###397 STEVE SPANGLER: Come here.
###397 I'm going to blow your mind.
###398 ZARAH BROWN: OK.
###399 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, you ready?
###400 ZARAH BROWN: Yeah, I'm ready.
###400 STEVE SPANGLER: So watch this.
###402 This is an experiment in mind control.
###404 OK, come here.
###404 ZARAH BROWN: OK.
###405 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, so watch this.
###406 So I have a Coke can and a Diet Coke can.
###408 ZARAH BROWN: Yeah.
###408 STEVE SPANGLER: And what I want you to do is I want you
###410 to pick one of the two cans.
###411 Which one do you have the biggest
###413 connection with mentally?
###414 ZARAH BROWN: OK, I got it.
###415 STEVE SPANGLER: [WHISPERS]
###416 This is all crap.
###417 Which one is it?
###418 ZARAH BROWN: It's-- well, I-- should I tell you?
###420 STEVE SPANGLER: No, let me divine it.
###422 Diet Coke.
###423 ZARAH BROWN: No.
###424 STEVE SPANGLER: That's--
###424 I was saying not Diet Coke.
###426 You want Coke, right?
###427 ZARAH BROWN: Yes.
###428 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###429 So here's what's going to happen.
###430 See, these little things will swing like this, OK?
###432 ZARAH BROWN: OK.
###433 STEVE SPANGLER: So I'm going to swing the
###434 cans back and forth.
###435 But because you picked Coke, I'm going to swing
###437 Coke first, all right?
###438 ZARAH BROWN: OK.
###439 STEVE SPANGLER: I want you to focus your attention
###440 on Coke, all right?
###441 ZARAH BROWN: OK.
###442 STEVE SPANGLER: Just stand right back here.
###443 ZARAH BROWN: All right.
###443 STEVE SPANGLER: Focus your attention on the Coke.
###444 I'm going to pull it back like this.
###446 I'm going to start it swinging.
###447 Ready?
###447 ZARAH BROWN: OK.
###447 STEVE SPANGLER: OK?
###448 Focus on the Coke, because both cans are
###449 going to start to move.
###450 Now use your mind to slow the Coke down.
###452 ZARAH BROWN: OK.
###452 STEVE SPANGLER: Use your mind to slow the--
###454 [GASPS]
###455 STEVE SPANGLER: Now transfer your thought
###457 waves to the Diet Coke.
###458 Ready?
###458 Slow them down.
###459 Slow them down.
###460 ZARAH BROWN: What?
###461 STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this.
###462 Now go back to the Coke, since that's the one that you
###464 started with.
###465 Slow it down.
###466 Slow it down.
###467 ZARAH BROWN: That's crazy.
###468 STEVE SPANGLER: Let it go.
###469 ZARAH BROWN: OK.
###469 STEVE SPANGLER: OK?
###469 Now go to the Diet Coke.
###470 Ready?
###471 ZARAH BROWN: OK.
###472 STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this.
###473 You're amazing.
###474 ZARAH BROWN: I should get a raise.
###475 STEVE SPANGLER: You should not--
###477 ZARAH BROWN: Yeah.
###477 STEVE SPANGLER: You should go back to work now, all right?
###479 All right, thank you.
###480 And no, it has nothing to do with the
###481 period of the pendulum.
###482 Don't worry.
###483 This is actual mind control right here.
###485 All right, I need another victim,
###487 somebody that's gullible.
###490 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###491 STEVE SPANGLER: This is the amazing mind control
###494 experiment.
###495 ANN: All right.
###495 STEVE SPANGLER: Got it?
###496 Right.
###496 Now you may walk in between them, because
###498 this is mind control.
###498 ANN: Do I have to say right here?
###499 STEVE SPANGLER: No, you can come here.
###500 ANN: OK.
###501 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, so watch.
###501 ANN: OK.
###502 STEVE SPANGLER: So you see the two pendulums?
###503 ANN: Mm-hm.
###503 STEVE SPANGLER: They're actually hooked with a piece
###505 of rope or string that's this way.
###507 And if you take both of them and pull back-- go ahead and
###509 take both of them and pull them back gently
###510 and let them swing--
###511 it's like pushing kids on a swing.
###513 Right?
###513 ANN: OK.
###513 Yeah.
###513 STEVE SPANGLER: All right.
###514 So what I want you to do is that you're going to focus on
###517 one of the two of them, OK?
###518 ANN: OK.
###518 STEVE SPANGLER: So here, I want you to
###519 stare at both of them.
###520 And I want you to think of one of the two of them.
###522 Ready?
###522 Which one?
###523 ANN: OK.
###523 STEVE SPANGLER: Which one?
###524 ANN: I want that one.
###525 STEVE SPANGLER: That is what I was thinking in my mind you
###527 were going to pick.
###528 ANN: Really?
###528 STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.
###529 Magic.
###530 All right, so now watch.
###531 I'm going to pull this can back.
###533 And we're going to start to let it swing.
###534 And what I want you to do is I want to focus your attention
###537 on this can.
###537 Ready?
###538 Focus your attention on the can.
###540 Focus it.
###541 You notice how The other one starts to swing as well?
###543 I want you to slow this one down with your mind.
###545 Use your mind and slow it down.
###546 Use your mind.
###547 Slow it down.
###548 [GASPS]
###549 You notice how the other one is swinging?
###550 Good.
###551 Let it go, Ann.
###552 Let it go.
###552 ANN: OK.
###552 STEVE SPANGLER: Got it?
###553 ANN: Yeah.
###553 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, now focus your mind on the Coke.
###556 Ready?
###556 ANN: OK.
###556 STEVE SPANGLER: Slow it down.
###557 Slow it down.
###558 Slow it down.
###559 Slow it down.
###560 Take the energy away from it.
###562 Good.
###563 Let it go.
###564 Let it go.
###565 Ready?
###566 [GASPS]
###566 Grab both cans.
###569 You have now been controlling objects with your mind.
###573 ANN: This is very exciting.
###574 STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.
###575 ANN: OK.
###575 STEVE SPANGLER: So now, for $19.95, I have a full system
###578 and a seminar that you could attend, all right?
###579 ANN: Oh.
###580 STEVE SPANGLER: It would be really, really good.
###580 ANN: OK.
###581 STEVE SPANGLER: All right?
###581 I think you're going to like it.
###582 ANN: OK.
###582 STEVE SPANGLER: So just give me your credit card.
###583 And I'll just write down--
###584 ANN: Sure.
###585 STEVE SPANGLER: Just your expiration date.
###586 ANN: OK, yeah.
###587 No problem.
###588 It's all in my phone.
###590 STEVE SPANGLER: She's coming to the seminar.
###592 OK?
###593 So watch this.
###593 Ready?
###593 So I'm going to pull it back here.
###594 Pull it back just a little bit more.
###596 OK, take it right to your eyes.
###598 And now don't move.
###599 Let go.
###601 See how it doesn't hit you?
###603 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.
###603 STEVE SPANGLER: That's the conservation of energy.
###606 No, you're moving your head.
###607 See, now it hit you.
###608 If you don't move--
###609 I should put you against a brick wall.
###611 This is even cooler.
###612 You know what we should do is, if I had a great big, huge
###615 wrecking ball, I could pull it right back to your
###617 nose, let it go.
###618 It would swing out.
###618 It would not hit you in the nose.
###620 FEMALE SPEAKER: I don't want to.
###621 STEVE SPANGLER: I'm doing that.
###623 That's an idea.
###625 Here we go.
###626 It's a bowling ball, 13 pounds, hooked onto a rope.
###630 And so here's what we're going to do, put you right there,
###633 your back against the wall.
###634 You can't move.
###636 So according to Isaac Newton, you can't get any more energy
###639 out of something than put into it.
###641 So if I pull this back, we have all this potential energy
###643 coming right to your nose.
###646 If I just let go of this, it should not come
###649 back and hit you.
###650 OK, so watch what happens.
###652 This would be our mannequin.
###653 Pretend like it was a mannequin.
###654 I'm going to swing out, add some energy,
###656 and let it come back.
###656 Watch.
###658 Ready?
###660 Here it comes.
###660 It's out and--
###662 [SCREAMS]
###662 [LAUGHTER]
###663 MALE SPEAKER: Well, that would be disaster.
###665 STEVE SPANGLER: That would be kind of a problem.
###667 [LAUGHTER]
###667 STEVE SPANGLER: But I don't think that'll happen with a
###669 human being.
###670 Let's try one.
###671 Newton said that we shouldn't get any more energy out of
###674 something than we put into it.
###675 So here's all this potential energy right
###677 up to Beau's head.
###678 Ready?
###679 So you've got to kiss your nose.
###680 There you go, right there.
###681 No, not yet.
###682 BEAU: Oh.
###682 [LAUGHTER]
###682 STEVE SPANGLER: All right.
###683 So here you go.
###683 Right there.
###684 And now let go!
###686 Hands down.
###687 Hands down.
###687 Hands down.
###688 Here it comes.
###689 Oh!
###689 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh!
###690 [LAUGHTER]
###691 STEVE SPANGLER: You see it coming towards you.
###693 Now, if you do this, if you put it right up to your nose
###695 and then do one of these, like this, and you swing it out,
###698 you put more energy back into it.
###700 Yeah.
###701 It'll smash your head.
###703 [LAUGHTER]
###703 BEAU: Smash your head.
###704 [LAUGHS]
###705 STEVE SPANGLER: She just has to trust that
###706 it's going to be OK.
###707 So are you ready?
###708 ZARAH BROWN: Yep.
###709 STEVE SPANGLER: So I'll do the release, of there's no
###710 possible way she could swing it wrong.
###712 So it's going go right to your nose.
###714 You got it?
###714 ZARAH BROWN: Yep.
###714 STEVE SPANGLER: Can you see right on the nose, Bradley?
###716 Right to the nose.
###717 You ready?
###718 Set.
###719 Don't move.
###720 Here it comes.
###721 Stay there.
###722 Don't move.
###722 Don't move.
###723 Don't move.
###723 ZARAH BROWN: [LAUGHS]
###724 STEVE SPANGLER: Ah!
###726 See?
###726 You proved the laws of science are correct.
###728 ZARAH BROWN: Hallelujah.
###729 STEVE SPANGLER: La!
###731 It's just touching your nose.
###733 Then let go.
###734 Don't move!
###735 Don't move!
###737 Ah!
###737 MALE SPEAKER: It's really intimidating.
###738 STEVE SPANGLER: Scared, huh?
###739 MALE SPEAKER: That's really intimidating.
###740 STEVE SPANGLER: Hands down.
###741 Hands down Hands down.
###743 Don't move.
###744 Don't move.
###744 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh!
###745 [LAUGHTER]
###746 MALE SPEAKER: God.
###747 [INAUDIBLE].
###749 MALE SPEAKER: Back.
###751 [LAUGHTER]
###754 STEVE SPANGLER: We're going to come back and smash
###756 [INAUDIBLE]
###756 [LAUGHTER]
###757 MALE SPEAKER: Woo!
###757 [LAUGHS]
###757 STEVE SPANGLER: Here it comes.
###759 It shouldn't have any more energy than you put--
###762 oh!
###762 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh!
###764 That was close.
###765 [LAUGHS]
###767 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###768 STEVE SPANGLER: That's back--
###770 [LAUGHS]
###771 [LAUGHTER]
###772 STEVE SPANGLER: There it is.
###774 There it is.
###775 There it is.
###775 It's there.
###777 [LAUGHTER]
###779 STEVE SPANGLER: That's a little too much.
###782 Oh!
###782 [LAUGHTER]
###783 STEVE SPANGLER: Did you see her hair.
###785 Isn't that great?
###786 Put your hands down.
###787 Don't move!
###787 Don't move!
###788 FEMALE SPEAKER: Don't move!
###788 STEVE SPANGLER: Don't move!
###788 FEMALE SPEAKER: Don't move!
###789 Don't move!
###789 Oh!
###789 [LAUGHS]
###790 [LAUGHTER]
###792 STEVE SPANGLER: See?
###792 You were fine.
###793 Oh!
###794 [LAUGHTER]
###795 STEVE SPANGLER: You're OK, Marie.
###798 No possible way.
###799 Don't move.
###800 Don't move!
###800 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, my God!
###801 My face!
###802 [LAUGHTER]
###803 STEVE SPANGLER: See?
###804 You're OK.
###807 Don't move.
###807 Don't move.
###808 ANN: [LAUGHS]
###810 [LAUGHTER]
###811 [APPLAUSE]
###814 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###814 STEVE SPANGLER: Here it swings.
###816 It's coming back.
###817 Do move.
###818 Oh.
###820 See?
###821 Beautiful.
###821 It works with no--
###822 oh!
###823 It works with no problem at all.
###825 And Isaac Newton was correct.
