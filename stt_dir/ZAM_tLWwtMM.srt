1
0:0:0,14 --> 0:0:5,69
model carman russell gave a really
interesting ted talk about how she's


2
0:0:5,69 --> 0:0:9,19
been extremely beautiful model and
because of that she often gets things


3
0:0:9,19 --> 0:0:14,32
that she doesn't deserve okay so it's
really really difficult for a woman to


4
0:0:14,32 --> 0:0:17,58
come forward and say that because
oftentimes people will criticize you for


5
0:0:17,58 --> 0:0:22,0
that they'll say all you're just getting
all these great uh... opportunities in


6
0:0:22,0 --> 0:0:25,73
life because you're beautiful but
there's not much more to it uh... and


7
0:0:25,73 --> 0:0:29,16
and she's completely honest about that
in fact let's watch a little snippet up


8
0:0:29,16 --> 0:0:30,359
here to talk


9
0:0:30,359 --> 0:0:31,75
i want to genetic lottery


10
0:0:31,75 --> 0:0:33,75
and i and the recipient of a legacy


11
0:0:33,75 --> 0:0:39,54
frick the past few centuries we have
defined beauty west tall slender figures


12
0:0:39,54 --> 0:0:41,22
and femininity


13
0:0:41,22 --> 0:0:45,44
and white skin and this is a legacy that
was built for me and it's a legacy that


14
0:0:45,44 --> 0:0:48,47
i've been cashing out on


15
0:0:48,47 --> 0:0:52,1
so she makes a ruling simply it you know


16
0:0:52,1 --> 0:0:55,64
there are certain things that we get the
biologically respond to in terms of


17
0:0:55,64 --> 0:0:58,79
purity so symmetry is one of them health


18
0:0:58,79 --> 0:1:1,81
uh... and honestly being young right


19
0:1:1,81 --> 0:1:6,73
slender has not missile had been part of
that equation abut over the last however


20
0:1:6,73 --> 0:1:10,41
many years in modern times it has


21
0:1:10,41 --> 0:1:14,159
become a part of the equation because of
societal expectations of saturn


22
0:1:14,159 --> 0:1:16,81
shes like and genetically i happen to be
skinny


23
0:1:16,81 --> 0:1:19,98
so i went a lottery even device in the
one


24
0:1:19,98 --> 0:1:22,67
and i happen to be tall and paul was in
the silly


25
0:1:22,67 --> 0:1:26,2
part of our d_n_a_ that were attracted
to twelve women but for whatever reason


26
0:1:26,2 --> 0:1:27,51
in the modeling world


27
0:1:27,51 --> 0:1:31,73
and it's mainly because they want to
close to hang offer them in you know


28
0:1:31,73 --> 0:1:32,99
at that's


29
0:1:32,99 --> 0:1:36,14
uh... she winds up already has made a
point com


30
0:1:36,14 --> 0:1:38,93
race that i thought was really
interesting yes


31
0:1:38,93 --> 0:1:42,75
she says look you know you have a tire
banks in the army and and all the stuff


32
0:1:42,75 --> 0:1:43,319
in


33
0:1:43,319 --> 0:1:47,419
although you know the white did to
succeed in modeling suspect them of the


34
0:1:47,419 --> 0:1:48,91
problems


35
0:1:48,91 --> 0:1:52,49
only four percent of them are minority
and not letting you know that that's


36
0:1:52,49 --> 0:1:55,93
amazing unalloyed that's actually based
on to say that was done by then why u


37
0:1:55,93 --> 0:1:56,909
p_h_d_


38
0:1:56,909 --> 0:2:1,46
uh... this as didn't look at six hundred
seventy seven models that were hired


39
0:2:1,46 --> 0:2:6,3
in the year two thousand seven and only
four percent of them outward not not


40
0:2:6,3 --> 0:2:7,9
white


41
0:2:7,9 --> 0:2:9,51
stunningly six percent white now


42
0:2:9,51 --> 0:2:14,27
while cell obviously this astonishing
within the modeling community but also


43
0:2:14,27 --> 0:2:15,68
really want to


44
0:2:15,68 --> 0:2:18,79
giver props for it you know


45
0:2:18,79 --> 0:2:21,669
in many something that's not be easy to
admit it's hard to do that and by the


46
0:2:21,669 --> 0:2:25,639
way she's really intelligent she
graduated from columbia uh... any


47
0:2:25,639 --> 0:2:29,34
graduates from colombia and any division
is really smart


48
0:2:29,34 --> 0:2:33,51
uh... but if you listen to her whole
tent auctions extreme really articulate


49
0:2:33,51 --> 0:2:36,499
very intelligent popping your you could
tell she's hard working but nobody


50
0:2:36,499 --> 0:2:39,259
notices any of that because the first
thing that they notice


51
0:2:39,259 --> 0:2:43,259
is the way that she looks and she says
it's unfair because you know she gets


52
0:2:43,259 --> 0:2:47,809
her ted talk begets millions of hits but
you know colin powell said talked into


53
0:2:47,809 --> 0:2:51,789
you as well and she's like why is it the
people are more interested to hear what


54
0:2:51,789 --> 0:2:56,49
amato has to say as opposed to what
someone like colin powell has to say and


55
0:2:56,49 --> 0:3:0,869
i think that that's very symbolic of
what our society is into oftentimes we


56
0:3:0,869 --> 0:3:4,89
get heat for covering so-called
celebrity stories when we come in


57
0:3:4,89 --> 0:3:7,829
celebrity stories because you guys and
loving you guys love to click on it you


58
0:3:7,829 --> 0:3:12,43
leg as left a comment on it no decided
one day we can we try to put


59
0:3:12,43 --> 0:3:15,499
are stamp on it meaning that we don't
cover like every other cigarette if


60
0:3:15,499 --> 0:3:18,39
there was a slight reserves like it


61
0:3:18,39 --> 0:3:24,769
did you see cardiac she's misled it
whereas in whatever we do correction we


62
0:3:24,769 --> 0:3:25,89
try to have a point


63
0:3:25,89 --> 0:3:27,14
rate we try to have


64
0:3:27,14 --> 0:3:31,129
the reason why we're trying to make a
point about society culture et cetera


65
0:3:31,129 --> 0:3:35,379
maybe we don't always succeed but let's
work going for but but you can


66
0:3:35,379 --> 0:3:38,62
we fall prey to the correct article it
was really interesting


67
0:3:38,62 --> 0:3:41,63
and she mentioned colin powell specific
because that is to give a speech the


68
0:3:41,63 --> 0:3:45,41
same time and she got four times the
number of users that are now there are


69
0:3:45,41 --> 0:3:49,359
other factors you see colin powell often
is a but you know what happened


70
0:3:49,359 --> 0:3:50,28
by some of those


71
0:3:50,28 --> 0:3:51,619
we got here on the show


72
0:3:51,619 --> 0:3:54,109
when i was a great worry if you don't
ship


73
0:3:54,109 --> 0:3:58,69
because you know and i think he's right
now is that they had so much is that i


74
0:3:58,69 --> 0:4:0,979
think that


75
0:4:0,979 --> 0:4:2,459
instinct was


76
0:4:2,459 --> 0:4:5,379
it'll be an interesting guess this is
really smart and has a really


77
0:4:5,379 --> 0:4:10,85
interesting point plus she's super hot
keep it real ight now right


78
0:4:10,85 --> 0:4:11,76
yes please


79
0:4:11,76 --> 0:4:14,419
into any such as the hotness to it said


80
0:4:14,419 --> 0:4:15,789
he's


81
0:4:15,789 --> 0:4:17,64
the category we wouldn't expect


82
0:4:17,64 --> 0:4:19,969
you know ice expect of a


83
0:4:19,969 --> 0:4:23,249
political conversation or interesting
cultural conversation from


84
0:4:23,249 --> 0:4:26,449
someone from the nation or alternet or


85
0:4:26,449 --> 0:4:29,469
political figure but since it's a model
since there for


86
0:4:29,469 --> 0:4:32,99
right right yes it is leasing a quandary
two sec


87
0:4:32,99 --> 0:4:35,5
do i accept all these offers


88
0:4:35,5 --> 0:4:38,12
when it's kind of unfair that they're
asking me why they should be asking more


89
0:4:38,12 --> 0:4:41,169
qualified people i don't think that
without a doubt she should accept the


90
0:4:41,169 --> 0:4:45,9
offers and one huge misconception is
that


91
0:4:45,9 --> 0:4:47,81
people were attracted get these great
opportunities right


92
0:4:47,81 --> 0:4:52,15
but oftentimes when it's a real
substantive opportunity let's say like


93
0:4:52,15 --> 0:4:56,229
co hosting a show for instance rain okay
you can get hired based on your lucks


94
0:4:56,229 --> 0:5:0,639
but your intellect is what heating going
that's what keeps you on michelle you


95
0:5:0,639 --> 0:5:6,539
can't be a moron in costa show emulate
cut too much better okay get man but you


96
0:5:6,539 --> 0:5:10,639
know what i mean like oftentimes people
get those accusations if yours if you're


97
0:5:10,639 --> 0:5:15,22
a cable to handle whatever the job that
is take it and your abilities will help


98
0:5:15,22 --> 0:5:19,91
you pursue whatever that is uh... some
no not and i've always thought that have


99
0:5:19,91 --> 0:5:20,61
been


100
0:5:20,61 --> 0:5:25,199
in august kind of obvious that people
hired me for my looks


101
0:5:25,199 --> 0:7:25,199
and so you know what i'm i think i ever
did over these years together doctor so
