0:0:16,18 --> 0:0:18,66
PATRICK BROWN: My photographs
are different from me.


3
0:0:18,66 --> 0:0:20,76
The photograph's a record
of what's been


4
0:0:20,76 --> 0:0:22,14
happening in front of me.


5
0:0:22,14 --> 0:0:25,6
It's not something
I've constructed.


6
0:0:25,6 --> 0:0:28,42
If I'm able to give a voice for
that situation, then I've


7
0:0:28,42 --> 0:0:29,83
achieved my objective.


8
0:0:29,83 --> 0:0:33,54
And that's really important to
me as an individual, but also


9
0:0:33,54 --> 0:0:34,79
as a photographer.


10
0:0:34,79 --> 0:1:1,25



11
0:1:1,25 --> 0:1:4,9
I love Bangkok for exactly the
same reasons I hate it.


12
0:1:4,9 --> 0:1:5,11
I love it for its noise.


13
0:1:5,11 --> 0:1:7,29
I love it for its intensity,
sweatiness.


14
0:1:7,29 --> 0:1:10,25
And there's always some treasure
troves in Bangkok.


15
0:1:10,25 --> 0:1:13,24
And for all those reasons,
it just drives me bonkers


16
0:1:13,24 --> 0:1:15,29
sometimes, and I
have to leave.


17
0:1:15,29 --> 0:1:18,59
But every place in the world
must drive people crazy and


18
0:1:18,59 --> 0:1:21,26
happy at the same time.


19
0:1:21,26 --> 0:1:22,22
My name is Patrick Brown.


20
0:1:22,22 --> 0:1:23,48
I'm a photographer.


21
0:1:23,48 --> 0:1:26,66
I've been based in Thailand
for the last 12 years.


22
0:1:26,66 --> 0:1:31,54
And this is home for
me for the while.


23
0:1:31,54 --> 0:1:32,79
[SPEAKING THAI]


24
0:1:32,79 --> 0:1:46,51



25
0:1:46,51 --> 0:1:47,54
PATRICK BROWN: I've traveled
all my live,


26
0:1:47,54 --> 0:1:49,16
since I was about five.


27
0:1:49,16 --> 0:1:51,14
Originally from England,
from Sheffield.


28
0:1:51,14 --> 0:1:52,275
Grew up in the Middle East.


29
0:1:52,275 --> 0:1:53,99
I spent some time
in South Africa.


30
0:1:53,99 --> 0:1:56,21
And I spent some
time in Canada.


31
0:1:56,21 --> 0:1:58,54
And finally, the family
settled in


32
0:1:58,54 --> 0:2:1,15
Australia when I was 13.


33
0:2:1,15 --> 0:2:3,85
I'm still doing what I did
when I was a young boy.


34
0:2:3,85 --> 0:2:7,77
I'm still travelling, still
meeting interesting people.


35
0:2:7,77 --> 0:2:12,2
I think photography for me was
the best visa I've never had


36
0:2:12,2 --> 0:2:13,57
in my life.


37
0:2:13,57 --> 0:2:15,71
I've been with racing
car drivers


38
0:2:15,71 --> 0:2:17,15
I've been with homeless.


39
0:2:17,15 --> 0:2:19,15
I've been with drug addicts.


40
0:2:19,15 --> 0:2:20,105
I've been with politicians.


41
0:2:20,105 --> 0:2:21,16
I've been with royalty.


42
0:2:21,16 --> 0:2:23,93
It's one of the best vehicles
to move in and out of


43
0:2:23,93 --> 0:2:26,17
societies that normally you
wouldn't be able to navigate


44
0:2:26,17 --> 0:2:28,4
your way through.


45
0:2:28,4 --> 0:2:31,83
That's my car that I rebuilt
when I was 18, modeled on an


46
0:2:31,83 --> 0:2:33,2
old English car.


47
0:2:33,2 --> 0:2:35,904
Took me about three months to
rebuild it, maybe even a bit


48
0:2:35,904 --> 0:2:37,29
longer, actually.


49
0:2:37,29 --> 0:2:40,35
I'm trained as a tool-maker,
which is somebody that makes


50
0:2:40,35 --> 0:2:41,7
machines and stuff.


51
0:2:41,7 --> 0:2:46,27
I really enjoy working
with my hands.


52
0:2:46,27 --> 0:2:50,58
And I like the craft of
photography, not just taking


53
0:2:50,58 --> 0:2:53,1
the photograph or the equipment,
but actually I like


54
0:2:53,1 --> 0:2:54,12
to produce a photograph.


55
0:2:54,12 --> 0:2:55,35
I like to go in the darkroom.


56
0:2:55,35 --> 0:2:58,26
I find the darkroom very
therapeutic, just dodging


57
0:2:58,26 --> 0:3:0,21
between the light and
making a photograph


58
0:3:0,21 --> 0:3:1,46
darker or lighter here.


59
0:3:1,46 --> 0:3:3,4
And it's hand-printed.


60
0:3:3,4 --> 0:3:5,735
You can never make another
print exactly the same.


61
0:3:5,735 --> 0:3:9,36
And I find that really
adorable.


62
0:3:9,36 --> 0:3:12,5
I was incredibly naive about
what documentary


63
0:3:12,5 --> 0:3:14,8
photography could do.


64
0:3:14,8 --> 0:3:15,99
I was working in a multi-story
carpark.


65
0:3:15,99 --> 0:3:18,16
And I saw a little snippet
about this guy


66
0:3:18,16 --> 0:3:19,24
in the local rag.


67
0:3:19,24 --> 0:3:22,39
And he was in Africa, where he
was the only surgeon for 2 and


68
0:3:22,39 --> 0:3:23,97
1/2 million people.


69
0:3:23,97 --> 0:3:28,35
So I sold my car and my
surfboard and went over there


70
0:3:28,35 --> 0:3:29,35
and documented him.


71
0:3:29,35 --> 0:3:31,37
And I was there for six weeks.


72
0:3:31,37 --> 0:3:33,7
Six weeks was all I could
get off for work.


73
0:3:33,7 --> 0:3:36,38
And I came back to Australia,
had an exhibition.


74
0:3:36,38 --> 0:3:37,8
It raised a lot of money for--


75
0:3:37,8 --> 0:3:39,405
his name is Robert Weeden.


76
0:3:39,405 --> 0:3:41,42
We made awareness for
him in Australia.


77
0:3:41,42 --> 0:3:42,92
And then it was published
in Australia.


78
0:3:42,92 --> 0:3:44,85
And it won a couple of awards.


79
0:3:44,85 --> 0:3:47,52
It was one of the pivotal points
when I realized you


80
0:3:47,52 --> 0:3:49,0
could actually make a difference
with a photograph.


81
0:3:49,0 --> 0:3:54,95



82
0:3:54,95 --> 0:3:59,25
And it wasn't until about '96,
'98 that I made a decision I


83
0:3:59,25 --> 0:4:0,96
could actually make
money from this.


84
0:4:0,96 --> 0:4:3,82
And then started to do more and
more work with magazines


85
0:4:3,82 --> 0:4:5,7
in Australia.


86
0:4:5,7 --> 0:4:8,47



87
0:4:8,47 --> 0:4:12,255
This is all animal trade, by the
way, full of animal stuff.


88
0:4:12,255 --> 0:4:14,86



89
0:4:14,86 --> 0:4:19,81
As you can see, everything's
under alphabetical order.


90
0:4:19,81 --> 0:4:23,33
Only I know where to find it.


91
0:4:23,33 --> 0:4:25,44
A colleague convinced
me, just get out of


92
0:4:25,44 --> 0:4:26,86
Australia and come to Asia.


93
0:4:26,86 --> 0:4:27,53
Have a look around.


94
0:4:27,53 --> 0:4:29,435
If you don't like it,
you can move on.


95
0:4:29,435 --> 0:4:32,28
And then I ended up in
Chiang Mai and met


96
0:4:32,28 --> 0:4:35,62
some Burmese refugees.


97
0:4:35,62 --> 0:4:38,42
They gave me access to places
I would never be able to get


98
0:4:38,42 --> 0:4:43,27
to, and opened up a whole world
to me that I really


99
0:4:43,27 --> 0:4:46,0
didn't know existed to the
extent that it did, and that


100
0:4:46,0 --> 0:4:48,88
was the Burmese border.


101
0:4:48,88 --> 0:4:54,8
This is on the Thai-Burma
border near [INAUDIBLE].


102
0:4:54,8 --> 0:4:55,98
And then you've got actually
real tiger


103
0:4:55,98 --> 0:4:58,98
teeth, and tiger claws.


104
0:4:58,98 --> 0:5:1,5
And these are different
tiger teeth.


105
0:5:1,5 --> 0:5:4,5
And they have different value
where they come from.


106
0:5:4,5 --> 0:5:7,68
These are used as potency, or
protective elements regarding


107
0:5:7,68 --> 0:5:8,73
the person that wears them.


108
0:5:8,73 --> 0:5:11,27
They have amulets on them,
or into key chains


109
0:5:11,27 --> 0:5:13,3
and things like that.


110
0:5:13,3 --> 0:5:16,84
"Trading to Extinction," I
started working on it in 2002.


111
0:5:16,84 --> 0:5:18,41
This is my first solo book.


112
0:5:18,41 --> 0:5:21,72
And I had no idea what the
animal trade was about.


113
0:5:21,72 --> 0:5:24,25
For me, the animal trade was
little trinkets selling in


114
0:5:24,25 --> 0:5:26,97
shops at that stage.


115
0:5:26,97 --> 0:5:30,83
And most of the world, I think
in some way, thought the same.


116
0:5:30,83 --> 0:5:35,12
Four years ago, the statistic
was $52 billion annually.


117
0:5:35,12 --> 0:5:38,18
That's what the animal trade is
worth, which rivals some of


118
0:5:38,18 --> 0:5:40,86
the biggest electronic
industries.


119
0:5:40,86 --> 0:5:43,67
One of my favorite statistics
from this whole project is


120
0:5:43,67 --> 0:5:48,79
that there's more Bengali tigers
in Texas than there is


121
0:5:48,79 --> 0:5:51,71
in the Bay of Bengal.


122
0:5:51,71 --> 0:5:53,1
It's a huge industry.


123
0:5:53,1 --> 0:5:54,93
And I would be still working
on this until


124
0:5:54,93 --> 0:5:56,34
probably the day I die.


125
0:5:56,34 --> 0:5:57,86
So there had to be
some physicality


126
0:5:57,86 --> 0:5:59,32
of boundaries placed.


127
0:5:59,32 --> 0:6:1,47
Southeast Asia was the spot.


128
0:6:1,47 --> 0:6:2,8
And plus, I live here.


129
0:6:2,8 --> 0:6:6,25
It made it quite logical.


130
0:6:6,25 --> 0:6:9,89
This is patrolling in southern
Cambodian in a


131
0:6:9,89 --> 0:6:11,17
place called Bokor.


132
0:6:11,17 --> 0:6:15,25
That was really quite an
amazing trip, that one.


133
0:6:15,25 --> 0:6:21,69
The first story I did was
anti-poaching team in Bokor.


134
0:6:21,69 --> 0:6:24,44
And this anti-poaching team,
we'd go in on a night


135
0:6:24,44 --> 0:6:25,9
insurgence.


136
0:6:25,9 --> 0:6:30,23
And we would hunt down or trace
down the poaching team.


137
0:6:30,23 --> 0:6:32,43
And most of the guys in the
actual anti-poaching team are


138
0:6:32,43 --> 0:6:35,26
actually ex-poachers, because
there's nothing better than a


139
0:6:35,26 --> 0:6:36,7
poacher to catch a poacher.


140
0:6:36,7 --> 0:6:40,42
He knows his routine and
he knows his habits.


141
0:6:40,42 --> 0:6:43,73
They're about to plan to do a
night insurgence, which I have


142
0:6:43,73 --> 0:6:45,67
to say is one of the scariest
things to do, because you're


143
0:6:45,67 --> 0:6:46,84
in total darkness.


144
0:6:46,84 --> 0:6:49,82
And you can only just see the
person in front of you.


145
0:6:49,82 --> 0:6:54,3
And the way your eyes work, the
center of your retina is


146
0:6:54,3 --> 0:6:57,25
actually damaged from the
amount of sun it's had.


147
0:6:57,25 --> 0:7:0,72
So you have to look out of
the corner of your eye.


148
0:7:0,72 --> 0:7:2,55
That's the most sensitive
part of your eye.


149
0:7:2,55 --> 0:7:6,38
That was a pretty intense
trip, that one.


150
0:7:6,38 --> 0:7:8,74
This is a poacher that's
been caught.


151
0:7:8,74 --> 0:7:11,96
And that's his name, his age,
and the crime, and where it


152
0:7:11,96 --> 0:7:13,93
was, and the date, obviously.


153
0:7:13,93 --> 0:7:19,18
And they did it to all the
poachers that they captured.


154
0:7:19,18 --> 0:7:21,82
I have quite a lot of empathy
for the poachers.


155
0:7:21,82 --> 0:7:24,5
A majority of the poachers
are just doing what their


156
0:7:24,5 --> 0:7:26,14
ancestors have done,
which is hunt.


157
0:7:26,14 --> 0:7:30,1
The Cambodian poachers that I
went with, I think they got


158
0:7:30,1 --> 0:7:32,73
$10 or $15 for each monkey--


159
0:7:32,73 --> 0:7:34,18
very, very little money.


160
0:7:34,18 --> 0:7:36,27
They have very, very little
knowledge of where that


161
0:7:36,27 --> 0:7:37,52
product's going to go.


162
0:7:37,52 --> 0:7:46,458



163
0:7:46,458 --> 0:7:51,3
This is pretty much all
I'll be taking.


164
0:7:51,3 --> 0:7:55,21
So take my four cameras, my
Polaroid, the Rolleiflex and


165
0:7:55,21 --> 0:8:0,68
my two Nikons, and three lenses,
and my film bag.


166
0:8:0,68 --> 0:8:9,19



167
0:8:9,19 --> 0:8:12,32
Welcome to Guangzhou
from Bangkok.


168
0:8:12,32 --> 0:8:14,78
Guangzhou is close to the
Hong Kong border.


169
0:8:14,78 --> 0:8:16,89
It's southwest China.


170
0:8:16,89 --> 0:8:20,53
And it's the economic powerhouse
for this region.


171
0:8:20,53 --> 0:8:23,49
It's very close to Tianjin,
which is the manufacturing


172
0:8:23,49 --> 0:8:25,43
powerhouse of China.


173
0:8:25,43 --> 0:8:28,98
Due to the wealth of the
manufacturing of Tianjin and


174
0:8:28,98 --> 0:8:31,48
the money that's come in to
this area, this has always


175
0:8:31,48 --> 0:8:35,179
been a fruitful place for
animal trafficking.


176
0:8:35,179 --> 0:8:38,909
What I'm hoping to achieve is to
see where we are five years


177
0:8:38,909 --> 0:8:40,8
down the track.


178
0:8:40,8 --> 0:8:41,51
It's a 10-year project.


179
0:8:41,51 --> 0:8:44,9
So where was I halfway through
this project I was


180
0:8:44,9 --> 0:8:45,43
here the last time.


181
0:8:45,43 --> 0:8:55,37



182
0:8:55,37 --> 0:8:57,2
It's good to come back
and relive it and


183
0:8:57,2 --> 0:8:57,895
see where we are.


184
0:8:57,895 --> 0:8:59,99
And what I'm hoping to
find is that things


185
0:8:59,99 --> 0:9:1,53
maybe have moved on.


186
0:9:1,53 --> 0:9:3,56
I don't think the trade is
in any way dwingled.


187
0:9:3,56 --> 0:9:6,39
I think they've just got smarter
about hiding it.


188
0:9:6,39 --> 0:9:9,2
They're not as confident
as the used to be.


189
0:9:9,2 --> 0:9:11,59
They know these things
do get out into the


190
0:9:11,59 --> 0:9:13,2
world outside China.


191
0:9:13,2 --> 0:9:17,284
So they're a bit more paranoid
about people with cameras.


192
0:9:17,284 --> 0:9:18,778
-[SPEAKING CHINESE]


193
0:9:18,778 --> 0:9:29,24



194
0:9:29,24 --> 0:9:30,74
PATRICK BROWN: I never
ask permission.


195
0:9:30,74 --> 0:9:32,8
I just get in there.


196
0:9:32,8 --> 0:9:35,38
And I know I've got a very short
window of opportunity to


197
0:9:35,38 --> 0:9:36,86
get the pictures.


198
0:9:36,86 --> 0:9:40,21
As soon as you start to ask for
permission, people are not


199
0:9:40,21 --> 0:9:41,61
going to be themselves.


200
0:9:41,61 --> 0:9:43,95
And a few times, I push
it, and I push it.


201
0:9:43,95 --> 0:9:46,71
If somebody's stopping me from
taking pictures, or tries to


202
0:9:46,71 --> 0:9:49,0
stop me from taking pictures,
I push it even further,


203
0:9:49,0 --> 0:9:51,38
because there's a reason
why this person is


204
0:9:51,38 --> 0:9:52,3
trying to stop me.


205
0:9:52,3 --> 0:9:55,64
Because he knows they're
doing something wrong.


206
0:9:55,64 --> 0:9:58,6
So the hardest thing
in a photograph is


207
0:9:58,6 --> 0:10:0,26
capturing an emotion.


208
0:10:0,26 --> 0:10:4,17
So if I'm able to capture this
angry person trying to stop me


209
0:10:4,17 --> 0:10:7,63
from taking pictures, it also
adds another little dimension


210
0:10:7,63 --> 0:10:10,9
to the body of work.


211
0:10:10,9 --> 0:10:14,22
We go into one pet shop which
specializes in selling fish.


212
0:10:14,22 --> 0:10:16,25
One fish in this particular
shop, I think,


213
0:10:16,25 --> 0:10:19,3
was worth about $10,000.


214
0:10:19,3 --> 0:10:21,71
The people-- the owner of the
shop openly talks about how he


215
0:10:21,71 --> 0:10:24,86
smuggled the fish in from
Australia, and smuggled them


216
0:10:24,86 --> 0:10:26,5
in from the Philippines.


217
0:10:26,5 --> 0:10:27,3
-[SPEAKING CHINESE]


218
0:10:27,3 --> 0:10:34,98



219
0:10:34,98 --> 0:10:36,75
-This is from the US.


220
0:10:36,75 --> 0:10:37,875
PATRICK BROWN: US?


221
0:10:37,875 --> 0:10:40,105
So that's an American
fish in China.


222
0:10:40,105 --> 0:10:41,44
-Yeah.


223
0:10:41,44 --> 0:10:43,42
They can make sure that--


224
0:10:43,42 --> 0:10:46,39
-[SPEAKING CHINESE]


225
0:10:46,39 --> 0:10:49,36
-Yeah, they don't really have
a legal channel to help you


226
0:10:49,36 --> 0:10:51,34
ship it back to Australia.


227
0:10:51,34 --> 0:10:55,85
He just confessed to me that a
lot of fish are smuggled in.


228
0:10:55,85 --> 0:10:56,39
PATRICK BROWN: He did?


229
0:10:56,39 --> 0:10:57,41
-Yeah.


230
0:10:57,41 --> 0:10:59,18
PATRICK BROWN: These guys
are untouchable.


231
0:10:59,18 --> 0:11:2,99
It's just not on the radar of
the law enforcement offices.


232
0:11:2,99 --> 0:11:4,73
It's not important
enough for them.


233
0:11:4,73 --> 0:11:7,65



234
0:11:7,65 --> 0:11:9,99
Everything in the market
isn't endangered, no.


235
0:11:9,99 --> 0:11:13,53
That's where that gray zone
of the wildlife trade


236
0:11:13,53 --> 0:11:14,7
comfortably sits in.


237
0:11:14,7 --> 0:11:17,62
And I'll use the crocodile
as an example.


238
0:11:17,62 --> 0:11:21,18
2 and 1/2 thousand tons of
live animals go through


239
0:11:21,18 --> 0:11:22,4
Heathrow a day.


240
0:11:22,4 --> 0:11:25,97
You have a shipment of, say,
25, 30 crocodiles.


241
0:11:25,97 --> 0:11:28,67
So the custom guys at Heathrow,
he's looking for


242
0:11:28,67 --> 0:11:31,25
contraband, he's looking
for drugs.


243
0:11:31,25 --> 0:11:32,635
But he's not a reptile expert.


244
0:11:32,635 --> 0:11:38,49
So he counts 30 crocodiles,
ticks that off, yeah, move on.


245
0:11:38,49 --> 0:11:42,15
In that 30, there could be
10 very, very endangered


246
0:11:42,15 --> 0:11:43,4
crocodiles.


247
0:11:43,4 --> 0:11:54,66



248
0:11:54,66 --> 0:11:59,24
Guangzhou's also very famous for
its wild game restaurants.


249
0:11:59,24 --> 0:12:1,57
But one of the most common
things is you can go choose


250
0:12:1,57 --> 0:12:4,15
your alligator, choose
your crocodile.


251
0:12:4,15 --> 0:12:5,89
And in this particular
restaurant, it's just out


252
0:12:5,89 --> 0:12:6,63
there in the open.


253
0:12:6,63 --> 0:12:9,15
And it's got its snout bound.


254
0:12:9,15 --> 0:12:11,43
And guests, that's the first
thing the see when they walk


255
0:12:11,43 --> 0:12:14,57
into the restaurant
is a crocodile.


256
0:12:14,57 --> 0:12:16,31
I want that crocodile
to be chopped up.


257
0:12:16,31 --> 0:12:17,82
And I want it for my dinner.


258
0:12:17,82 --> 0:12:19,48
That's all you have to say,
and it will be done.


259
0:12:19,48 --> 0:12:24,63



260
0:12:24,63 --> 0:12:27,26
With the animal trade, the
consumption of animals, it's


261
0:12:27,26 --> 0:12:30,83
more to do with you
are what you eat.


262
0:12:30,83 --> 0:12:34,71
So you consume a piece of the
tiger, you'll inherit a part


263
0:12:34,71 --> 0:12:35,38
of that tiger.


264
0:12:35,38 --> 0:12:38,58
And you become more virile and
stronger and you'll fight off


265
0:12:38,58 --> 0:12:42,54
a cold, or you'll beat
the arthritis.


266
0:12:42,54 --> 0:12:45,87
Most of the animal is consumed
in some form or manner, or


267
0:12:45,87 --> 0:12:50,44
used to develop a cream
or a soup or a tea, or


268
0:12:50,44 --> 0:12:51,69
something like that.


269
0:12:51,69 --> 0:12:59,3



270
0:12:59,3 --> 0:13:3,57
We went to Safari World, which
is about 40 minutes outside


271
0:13:3,57 --> 0:13:5,16
the central Guangzhou.


272
0:13:5,16 --> 0:13:7,31
And it's just a huge


273
0:13:7,31 --> 0:13:10,65
entertainment complex for families.


274
0:13:10,65 --> 0:13:13,13
It revolves around animals.


275
0:13:13,13 --> 0:13:14,94
There is a circus.


276
0:13:14,94 --> 0:13:16,492
And there is a zoo.


277
0:13:16,492 --> 0:13:17,79
And I do agree with them.


278
0:13:17,79 --> 0:13:19,2
They're very educational.


279
0:13:19,2 --> 0:13:20,78
And you need those
institutions.


280
0:13:20,78 --> 0:13:24,36
But realistically, an
elephant in a zoo


281
0:13:24,36 --> 0:13:27,8
is actually a prisoner.


282
0:13:27,8 --> 0:13:29,45
They've got X amount of space.


283
0:13:29,45 --> 0:13:31,51
And they know that X amount
of space like the


284
0:13:31,51 --> 0:13:33,36
back of their hand.


285
0:13:33,36 --> 0:13:37,28
Zoos make a lot of money.


286
0:13:37,28 --> 0:13:39,87
They're a great money earner.


287
0:13:39,87 --> 0:13:42,82
And the rarer the animal you
have, or the rarer collection


288
0:13:42,82 --> 0:13:44,73
of animals you have,
the more people are


289
0:13:44,73 --> 0:13:46,32
going to go see them.


290
0:13:46,32 --> 0:13:50,51
Some zoos are legitimate,
and some zoos aren't.


291
0:13:50,51 --> 0:13:54,19
The majority of zoos and in this
part of the world are not


292
0:13:54,19 --> 0:13:55,44
so legitimate.


293
0:13:55,44 --> 0:13:57,79



294
0:13:57,79 --> 0:14:2,8
When we went to Safari World,
they have flamingos in


295
0:14:2,8 --> 0:14:2,64
restaurants.


296
0:14:2,64 --> 0:14:5,31
So people can have a nice
steak and watch a pink


297
0:14:5,31 --> 0:14:8,86
flamingo, which is obviously
not native to Asia.


298
0:14:8,86 --> 0:14:11,52
Then in another restaurant,
you have the White Tiger


299
0:14:11,52 --> 0:14:14,11
Restaurant, where you can sit
down and have your meal and


300
0:14:14,11 --> 0:14:17,71
watch probably one of most
endangered tigers in the world


301
0:14:17,71 --> 0:14:19,54
walk around while you
have your meal.


302
0:14:19,54 --> 0:14:23,75
And supposedly in this
particular institution, it has


303
0:14:23,75 --> 0:14:28,14
50% of the world's population
of white tigers.


304
0:14:28,14 --> 0:14:30,2
That's something wrong there.


305
0:14:30,2 --> 0:14:41,7



306
0:14:41,7 --> 0:14:42,83
I'm not an animal activist.


307
0:14:42,83 --> 0:14:47,13
It's more about exposing those
subcultures in society.


308
0:14:47,13 --> 0:14:50,19
The animal is not really
the story.


309
0:14:50,19 --> 0:14:53,61
What's happening to the
animals is the story.


310
0:14:53,61 --> 0:14:56,36
And that cause is actually the
subcultures of smugglers and


311
0:14:56,36 --> 0:14:58,99
poachers and customers.


312
0:14:58,99 --> 0:15:1,71
That's what I'm interested in.


313
0:15:1,71 --> 0:15:5,59
My career as a photographer in
the last 10 years has been


314
0:15:5,59 --> 0:15:8,85
focused around the
animal trade.


315
0:15:8,85 --> 0:15:10,61
Every little penny I've
earned has gone


316
0:15:10,61 --> 0:15:12,24
back into this project.


317
0:15:12,24 --> 0:15:14,66
And one of the biggest
discussions that I had with


318
0:15:14,66 --> 0:15:17,5
publishers was that it was
in black and white.


319
0:15:17,5 --> 0:15:19,3
If I had shot this in
color, I think it


320
0:15:19,3 --> 0:15:20,6
would have no problems.


321
0:15:20,6 --> 0:15:21,65
It would have been printed
straight away.


322
0:15:21,65 --> 0:15:24,84
But for some reason, because
it's in black and white, it


323
0:15:24,84 --> 0:15:26,88
scares people away,
financially.


324
0:15:26,88 --> 0:15:31,15
The reason I shot it in
black and white was a


325
0:15:31,15 --> 0:15:33,47
really simple reason.


326
0:15:33,47 --> 0:15:36,54
I really understand black
and white film.


327
0:15:36,54 --> 0:15:37,91
I dream in black and white.


328
0:15:37,91 --> 0:15:39,16
I don't dream in color.


329
0:15:39,16 --> 0:15:42,34
So on a subconscious level, I
think black and white is more


330
0:15:42,34 --> 0:15:47,14
of a powerful tool to let people
delve more into their


331
0:15:47,14 --> 0:15:49,28
subconsciousness to actually
get a bit more


332
0:15:49,28 --> 0:15:52,33
of a sense of placement.


333
0:15:52,33 --> 0:15:54,93
They let their imagination go a
little bit further than they


334
0:15:54,93 --> 0:15:57,382
would do if they were looking
at a color photograph.


335
0:15:57,382 --> 0:15:59,76
For me, it really tells
a story in a much


336
0:15:59,76 --> 0:16:1,5
more clearer sense.


337
0:16:1,5 --> 0:16:6,91



338
0:16:6,91 --> 0:16:10,53
We visited the Guangzhou
Medicine Market, which is a


339
0:16:10,53 --> 0:16:12,32
very famous institution.


340
0:16:12,32 --> 0:16:13,49
It's pretty wacky.


341
0:16:13,49 --> 0:16:17,47
You see a lot of crazy things
there, from seahorses, geckos


342
0:16:17,47 --> 0:16:21,36
drying on the street, turtles,
a multitude of different


343
0:16:21,36 --> 0:16:25,14
creatures for sale, and parts
of different creatures.


344
0:16:25,14 --> 0:16:29,212
What drives the industry
is naivety and greed.


345
0:16:29,212 --> 0:16:32,8
Naivety in the sense of lack
of education regarding what


346
0:16:32,8 --> 0:16:35,91
the health benefits from some
of these products do.


347
0:16:35,91 --> 0:16:41,22
Rhino horn is one
of the classics.


348
0:16:41,22 --> 0:16:44,53
If you consume a rhino horn,
mythology believes that you'll


349
0:16:44,53 --> 0:16:48,1
be able to mate for two
or three hours.


350
0:16:48,1 --> 0:16:48,61
It doesn't work.


351
0:16:48,61 --> 0:16:50,15
But it's very porous.


352
0:16:50,15 --> 0:16:53,59
So one of the tricks of the
trade is to soak the rhino


353
0:16:53,59 --> 0:16:55,63
horn actually in the Viagra.


354
0:16:55,63 --> 0:16:56,88
So that drives the
trade as well.


355
0:16:56,88 --> 0:16:58,11
It's all this naivety.


356
0:16:58,11 --> 0:17:0,82
And it works, because it's
soaked in Viagra.


357
0:17:0,82 --> 0:17:2,7
A bag of [INAUDIBLE].


358
0:17:2,7 --> 0:17:7,3



359
0:17:7,3 --> 0:17:9,359
A few hundred years ago,
people would be


360
0:17:9,359 --> 0:17:11,69
invited to a wedding.


361
0:17:11,69 --> 0:17:14,109
And just the immediate family
would have shark fin soup.


362
0:17:14,109 --> 0:17:17,16
And guests would stand around in
awe that they were able to


363
0:17:17,16 --> 0:17:18,385
eat shark fin soup.


364
0:17:18,385 --> 0:17:20,66
It was a very sought
after delicacy.


365
0:17:20,66 --> 0:17:24,16
Now the wedding parties have
grown to 300 or 400 people.


366
0:17:24,16 --> 0:17:26,78
And they all have
shark fin soup.


367
0:17:26,78 --> 0:17:29,89
When you look at the shark fins,
you see the bags and


368
0:17:29,89 --> 0:17:31,56
hundreds of bags
of this stuff.


369
0:17:31,56 --> 0:17:35,69
And three fins basically
means one shark.


370
0:17:35,69 --> 0:17:40,65
It's just a staggering amount
of sharks that have died for


371
0:17:40,65 --> 0:17:43,74
something that's basically
cartilage and


372
0:17:43,74 --> 0:17:45,61
doesn't taste of anything.


373
0:17:45,61 --> 0:17:49,54
While we were in the medicine
market in Guangzhou, this guy


374
0:17:49,54 --> 0:17:53,17
in a blue track suit comes up
to me while taking pictures.


375
0:17:53,17 --> 0:17:56,8
And he's trying to sell me
some bear bile products.


376
0:17:56,8 --> 0:17:59,76
He was a little bit
uncomfortable with the Chinese


377
0:17:59,76 --> 0:18:2,12
watching him, and watching
the deal go down.


378
0:18:2,12 --> 0:18:5,625
So we get him aside, and
we go talk about it.

0:18:26,5 --> 0:18:30,25
PATRICK BROWN: He said he bought
it off some guy who was


382
0:18:30,25 --> 0:18:32,95
either from Tibet
or from Nepal.


383
0:18:32,95 --> 0:18:36,61
And he got a customs official
on the border to


384
0:18:36,61 --> 0:18:38,57
get it in to China.


385
0:18:38,57 --> 0:18:41,52
And he's going to Guangzhou,
which traveling thousands of


386
0:18:41,52 --> 0:18:45,65
kilometers to sell two items
shows you how much of a hub


387
0:18:45,65 --> 0:18:47,65
Guangzhou is.


388
0:18:47,65 --> 0:18:53,46
After 9/11, there was a big push
to find out who are the


389
0:18:53,46 --> 0:18:57,91
people who are generating income
for the terrorists and


390
0:18:57,91 --> 0:18:59,9
the smuggling routes.


391
0:18:59,9 --> 0:19:2,66
And it wasn't until Congress
decided to put a lot of


392
0:19:2,66 --> 0:19:6,13
funding into that, once it was
researched, it pretty much


393
0:19:6,13 --> 0:19:9,999
took everybody by surprise how
big the animal trade was.

0:19:15,867 --> 0:19:17,69
PATRICK BROWN: He wants to
keep the camera out?


399
0:19:17,69 --> 0:19:18,7
-Yeah.


400
0:19:18,7 --> 0:19:19,555
It attracts a crowd.


401
0:19:19,555 --> 0:19:20,91
PATRICK BROWN: It attracts
a crowd.


402
0:19:20,91 --> 0:19:21,91
I understand.


403
0:19:21,91 --> 0:19:23,757
Well, he's doing something
that's legal.


404
0:19:23,757 --> 0:19:26,67



405
0:19:26,67 --> 0:19:27,695
We'll just stand in there.


406
0:19:27,695 --> 0:19:29,76
And the camera will
stay out here.


407
0:19:29,76 --> 0:19:31,895
We'll just stand in there, so
the camera doesn't come.


408
0:19:31,895 --> 0:19:36,35



409
0:19:36,35 --> 0:19:39,11
10 years in the project, I've
never had somebody literally


410
0:19:39,11 --> 0:19:42,77
come up to me and want to do the
deal there and then, and


411
0:19:42,77 --> 0:19:44,61
totally blase about it all.


412
0:19:44,61 --> 0:19:48,25
He saw me as an opportunity to
try and make a quick dollar.


413
0:19:48,25 --> 0:19:51,92
He wanted $1,000 basically
for a very small


414
0:19:51,92 --> 0:19:53,77
amount of bear bile.


415
0:19:53,77 --> 0:19:55,2
OK, thank you.


416
0:19:55,2 --> 0:20:4,74



417
0:20:4,74 --> 0:20:10,91
This is the last trip for
the animal trade.


418
0:20:10,91 --> 0:20:13,62
This is it.


419
0:20:13,62 --> 0:20:15,245
I'm 43 years old.


420
0:20:15,245 --> 0:20:18,21
I've been doing this for just
under a quarter of my life.


421
0:20:18,21 --> 0:20:21,7



422
0:20:21,7 --> 0:20:23,62
A few months from now, people
will be holding a book in


423
0:20:23,62 --> 0:20:24,906
their hands.


424
0:20:24,906 --> 0:20:26,218
And it will no longer
be my book.


425
0:20:26,218 --> 0:20:27,468
It'll be their book.


426
0:20:27,468 --> 0:20:30,82



427
0:20:30,82 --> 0:20:34,73
I always knew I would
get to this stage.


428
0:20:34,73 --> 0:20:35,29
But now I'm here.


429
0:20:35,29 --> 0:20:38,96
Actually, it's just kind of
weird that it doesn't actually


430
0:20:38,96 --> 0:20:42,3
feel like it's really
happening.


431
0:20:42,3 --> 0:20:43,36
It's 10 years in the making.


432
0:20:43,36 --> 0:20:46,8
And it's going to where
I initially thought it


433
0:20:46,8 --> 0:20:47,75
would always go.


434
0:20:47,75 --> 0:20:52,19
It's quite a nice feeling,
actually, I have to say.
