I know something is
going to go wrong.


55
0:2:14,767 --> 0:2:16,503
I think the people
that say nothing will


56
0:2:16,503 --> 0:2:18,238
go wrong and everything
will go right,


57
0:2:18,238 --> 0:2:22,742
I think they're obsessive
in the wrong direction.


58

We live on graham
cracker crust here.


59
0:2:25,245 --> 0:2:26,946
In this part of
Southern California we

we have approximately


61
0:2:29,449 --> 0:2:31,551
five or six
major faults.

0:2:38,658 --> 0:2:40,827
<i> Bob believes it's
 just a matter of time</i>


66
0:2:40,827 --> 0:2:42,929
<i> before one of them is
 powerful enough to</i>

<i> destroy his community and
 throw society into chaos.</i>


68
0:2:47,901 --> 0:2:49,903
Bob Kay: We have major
earthquake faults


69
0:2:49,903 --> 0:2:52,272
running directly under
the major freeways here.


70
0:2:52,272 --> 0:2:55,175
It wouldn't take much for
a major earthquake to


71
0:2:55,175 --> 0:2:58,611
pretty much sever those
arteries so that folks


72
0:2:58,611 --> 0:3:1,481
can't get materials in
and they can't get out.


73
0:3:1,481 --> 0:3:3,983
<i> Narrator: If a magnitude
 7.8 quake or stronger</i>


74
0:3:3,983 --> 0:3:7,887
<i> hits California, it could
 topple 1,500 buildings,</i>


75
0:3:7,887 --> 0:3:10,356

<i> would depend on for

78
0:3:16,729 --> 0:3:19,65
<i> So Bob's plan is to
 turn his two and a</i>


79
0:3:19,65 --> 0:3:22,969
<i> half acre estate into a
 self-sustaining oasis</i>


80
0:3:22,969 --> 0:3:24,938
<i> where his family
 can safely wait out</i>


81
0:3:24,938 --> 0:3:28,241
<i> the chaos following
 a killer quake.</i>


82
0:3:28,241 --> 0:3:31,644
<i> And he's not afraid to
 spend money to do it.</i>


83
0:3:31,644 --> 0:3:33,379
Bob Kay: I don't
do anything small.


84
0:3:33,379 --> 0:3:35,682
Over the course of the
last twelve months


85
0:3:35,682 --> 0:3:39,18
I've spent approximately
$150,000 on my preps.


86
0:3:39,18 --> 0:3:41,688
I've been extremely
successful at what I do.


87
0:3:41,688 --> 0:3:43,957
And that has allowed me
to have the financial


88
0:3:43,957 --> 0:3:46,626
resources and the time to
be able to invest part of


89
0:3:46,626 --> 0:3:50,496
my life to making sure my
family is taken care of.


90
0:3:50,496 --> 0:3:52,732
<i> Narrator: Many preppers
 dream about the elaborate</i>


91
0:3:52,732 --> 0:3:55,401
<i> things they would buy, if
 money were not an object.</i>


92
0:3:55,401 --> 0:3:57,704
<i> For Bob, having
 multiple back-up</i>


93
0:3:57,704 --> 0:4:0,607
<i> bug-out vehicles
 is worth any cost.</i>


94
0:4:0,607 --> 0:4:2,609
Bob Kay: My preferred
bug out vehicle?


95
0:4:2,609 --> 0:4:5,211
Motorcycle, nothing
impedes the motorcycle.


96
0:4:5,211 --> 0:4:7,58
You can get pretty
much anywhere on it.


97
0:4:7,58 --> 0:4:11,284
And I don't have
just one, I have six.


98
0:4:11,284 --> 0:4:15,288
<i> Narrator: The motorcycles
 cost Bob another $110,000.</i>


99
0:4:15,288 --> 0:4:18,925
<i> He spent $35,000 more
 landscaping his estate and</i>


100
0:4:18,925 --> 0:4:23,496
<i> every tree and shrub
 serves a prepper purpose.</i>


101
0:4:23,496 --> 0:4:25,698
Bob Kay: I have well
over 300 different types


102
0:4:25,698 --> 0:4:27,9
of plants that can be
used for food either by


103
0:4:27,9 --> 0:4:31,204
their fruiting or
the plant directly.


104
0:4:31,204 --> 0:4:33,373

Bob Kay: Once we
distill it and then


109

just run it through
a carbon filter,


110
0:4:44,584 --> 0:4:45,985
it's fine.


111
0:4:45,985 --> 0:4:48,154
You're taking the water,
turning it into a gas,


112
0:4:48,154 --> 0:4:49,656
and then converting
it back right


113
0:4:49,656 --> 0:4:51,457
into a liquid again.


114
0:4:51,457 --> 0:4:54,36
Cheers.

116
0:4:55,828 --> 0:4:58,531
Alexis Kay: Tastes just
like normal water.

I think it's
pretty fun.


126

I'm pretty much the one
that comes up with the


127
0:5:18,184 --> 0:5:20,42

dad buys the preps.

of stuff?


146

towards the upper end.

In terms of how I prep,

0:7:17,503 --> 0:7:20,273
Alexis is fully capable
of defending herself.


192
0:7:20,273 --> 0:7:21,474
<i> Narrator: Like
 many children,</i>


193
0:7:21,474 --> 0:7:24,277
<i> Alexis is drawn
 to martial arts.</i>


194
0:7:24,277 --> 0:7:26,345
<i> She received her second
 degree black belt</i>


195
0:7:26,345 --> 0:7:28,781
<i> in tae-kwon-do
 when she was ten.</i>


196
0:7:28,781 --> 0:7:32,585
Bob Kay: Ow.


197
0:7:32,585 --> 0:7:34,12
<i> Narrator: But Alexis
 wants to be able to</i>


198
0:7:34,12 --> 0:7:36,689
<i> defend herself before a
 violent confrontation</i>


199
0:7:36,689 --> 0:7:39,692
<i> comes down to
 hand-to-hand combat.</i>


200
0:7:39,692 --> 0:7:42,28
<i> She recently told her
 father she wanted</i>


201
0:7:42,28 --> 0:7:44,564
<i> to learn how to
 throw knives.</i>


202
0:7:44,564 --> 0:7:46,999
<i> So Bob custom built a
 target range on his</i>


203
0:7:46,999 --> 0:7:49,602
<i> property and
 bought her $1,000</i>


204
0:7:49,602 --> 0:7:51,904
<i> worth of top of
 the line knives.</i>


205
0:7:51,904 --> 0:7:54,507
Bob Kay: These knives are
incredibly high quality.


206
0:7:54,507 --> 0:7:57,91
The larger ones we
use are actually


207
0:7:57,91 --> 0:7:59,378
competition
quality knives.


208
0:7:59,378 --> 0:8:2,281
It's a very effective,
concealable type


209
0:8:2,281 --> 0:8:4,45
of weapon for
self defense.


210
0:8:4,45 --> 0:8:6,152
Very convenient.


211
0:8:6,152 --> 0:8:7,854
You have to have a lot
of respect for a knife


212
0:8:7,854 --> 0:8:9,388
or a bladed
weapon and


213
0:8:9,388 --> 0:8:11,9
she's learning
the respect.


214
0:8:11,9 --> 0:8:12,358
Alexis Kay: I was
more influenced by


215
0:8:12,358 --> 0:8:13,926
videogames than
anything else,


216
0:8:13,926 --> 0:8:16,496
because any
videogame character,


217
0:8:16,496 --> 0:8:18,898
you tell it to throw a
knife and it looks easy,


218
0:8:18,898 --> 0:8:19,999
it looks effortless.


219
0:8:19,999 --> 0:8:21,968
So I thought,
why not?


220
0:8:21,968 --> 0:8:23,836
Why not try
throwing knives?


221
0:8:23,836 --> 0:8:26,138
But when you actually
try to throw a knife,


222
0:8:26,138 --> 0:8:27,473
it's a lot more of
a challenge than


223
0:8:27,473 --> 0:8:30,309
it actually looks.


224
0:8:30,309 --> 0:8:33,12
Bob Kay: Perfect.


225
0:8:33,12 --> 0:8:35,882
Pretty good.


226
0:8:35,882 --> 0:8:37,517
<i> Narrator: Throwing
 knives would help Alexis</i>


227
0:8:37,517 --> 0:8:39,919
<i> in a short-range fight,
 but she also wants an</i>


228
0:8:39,919 --> 0:8:42,355
<i> option to protect
 herself from attackers</i>


229
0:8:42,355 --> 0:8:44,891
<i> at even greater
 distances.</i>


230
0:8:44,891 --> 0:8:47,36
<i> So Bob's hired her
 a personal firearm</i>


231
0:8:47,36 --> 0:8:52,398
<i> instructor, spent $4,000
 on a high-end rifle,</i>


232
0:8:52,398 --> 0:8:55,334
<i> built a private shooting
 range on his own property</i>


233
0:8:55,334 --> 0:8:59,305
<i> and added $300 of zombie
 targets that bleed</i>


234
0:8:59,305 --> 0:9:1,641
<i> or explode to get her
 accustomed to aiming</i>


235
0:9:1,641 --> 0:9:3,309
<i> at a human figure.</i>


236
0:9:3,309 --> 0:9:5,778
Nate: You're too
close to the scope.


237
0:9:5,778 --> 0:9:9,582
Lean forward.


238
0:9:9,582 --> 0:9:10,683
Can you see
your target?


239
0:9:10,683 --> 0:9:11,817
Alexis Kay: Yeah.


240
0:9:11,817 --> 0:9:13,19
Nate: Okay,
ready to fire?


241
0:9:13,19 --> 0:9:14,42
Fire!


242
0:9:14,42 --> 0:9:15,521
Good job!


243
0:9:15,521 --> 0:9:18,925
Bob: First shot, that
gun I can't do that.


244
0:9:18,925 --> 0:9:22,61
One shot, right through
the top of the chest.


245
0:9:22,61 --> 0:9:23,563
Joel: It's
where you want it.


246
0:9:23,563 --> 0:9:24,897
Bob: That was incredible.


247
0:9:24,897 --> 0:9:27,199
Nate: That's a combat
accurate hit right there.


248
0:9:27,199 --> 0:9:30,336
You can't ask any more
than that from this far.


249
0:9:30,336 --> 0:9:32,171
Bob Kay: You guys did a
great job, thank you.


250
0:9:32,171 --> 0:9:33,573
Alexis Kay: Definitely
not as easy as it


251
0:9:33,573 --> 0:9:39,712
looks in video games.


252
0:9:39,712 --> 0:9:41,38
<i> Narrator: Including
 Alexis' defensive</i>


253
0:9:41,38 --> 0:9:44,517

 already spent $150,000</i>


254
0:9:44,517 --> 0:9:46,919
<i> on prepping in
 the past year.</i>


255
0:9:46,919 --> 0:9:49,155
<i> But now he wants to ensure

 California is ever</i>


257
0:9:51,791 --> 0:9:54,56
<i> leveled by a
 massive earthquake.</i>


258
0:9:54,56 --> 0:9:56,996
<i> So he's about to
 spend almost half a</i>


259
0:9:56,996 --> 0:10:5,705
<i> million dollars on
 one final prep.</i>


260
0:10:5,705 --> 0:10:6,973
Bob Kay: A year
ago I'm watching


261
0:10:6,973 --> 0:10:9,41
Doomsday Preppers
and I come to the


262
0:10:9,41 --> 0:10:12,411
realization:
I'm a prepper.


263
0:10:12,411 --> 0:10:14,68
<i> Narrator: In Bob Kay's
 first year as a prepper,</i>


264
0:10:14,68 --> 0:10:17,65
<i> he spent $150,000
 preparing his southern</i>


265
0:10:17,65 --> 0:10:22,121
<i> California estate for a
 catastrophic earthquake.</i>


266
0:10:22,121 --> 0:10:24,357
<i> He just spent
 another $40,000</i>


267
0:10:24,357 --> 0:10:25,791
<i> on freeze-dried food.</i>


268
0:10:25,791 --> 0:10:26,959
Alexis Kay: It's
like freeze-dried


269
0:10:26,959 --> 0:10:28,427
life insurance.


270
0:10:28,427 --> 0:10:29,996
<i> Narrator: And the
 constant spending is</i>


271
0:10:29,996 --> 0:10:31,33
<i> threatening to
 divide the family.</i>


272
0:10:31,33 --> 0:10:33,499
Jade Kay: It's
so much money.


273
0:10:33,499 --> 0:10:36,836
I think prepping is
a little bit crazy.


274
0:10:36,836 --> 0:10:38,404
Um, I still
think it's kind


275
0:10:38,404 --> 0:10:41,474
of wasting,
wasting money.


276
0:10:41,474 --> 0:10:43,275
<i> Narrator: Bob lives only
 an hour away from a</i>


277
0:10:43,275 --> 0:10:45,411
<i> nuclear plant he fears
 wouldn't withstand</i>


278
0:10:45,411 --> 0:10:48,714
<i> a quake greater than 7.0.</i>


279
0:10:48,714 --> 0:10:51,484
<i> For most, quickly
 escaping nuclear fallout</i>


280
0:10:51,484 --> 0:10:53,486
<i> would be an
 insurmountable obstacle,</i>


281
0:10:53,486 --> 0:10:57,189
<i> but Bob can afford to
 spend his way to safety.</i>


282
0:10:57,189 --> 0:10:59,358
Bob Kay: If things
go really badly,


283
0:10:59,358 --> 0:11:1,227
nobody's going to
be getting out of


284
0:11:1,227 --> 0:11:4,163
this area by a truck
or bus or a car.


285
0:11:4,163 --> 0:11:12,805
The way to go, gotta
take it to a new level.


286
0:11:12,805 --> 0:11:14,54
<i> Narrator: Today, Bob
 and his daughter,</i>


287
0:11:14,54 --> 0:11:17,61
<i> Alexis, are meeting
 pilot Johan Nurmi.</i>


288
0:11:17,61 --> 0:11:23,482
Bob Kay: Let's do it.


289
0:11:23,482 --> 0:11:25,84
Want to talk to you
about some helicopters,


290
0:11:25,84 --> 0:11:26,52
need your services.


291
0:11:26,52 --> 0:11:26,919
Johan Nurmi: Yes sir.


292
0:11:26,919 --> 0:11:28,287
I recommend this one.


293
0:11:28,287 --> 0:11:29,321
It's a four seater.


294
0:11:29,321 --> 0:11:32,24
She can carry 800
pounds inside and


295
0:11:32,24 --> 0:11:33,559
we can still
have fuel.


296
0:11:33,559 --> 0:11:35,94
Bob Kay: Okay,
and range?


297
0:11:35,94 --> 0:11:36,896
Johan Nurmi: We
can fly for about two


298
0:11:36,896 --> 0:11:38,23
and a half hours.


299
0:11:38,23 --> 0:11:39,598
In California you
have an airport every


300
0:11:39,598 --> 0:11:41,333
30 miles approximately.


301
0:11:41,333 --> 0:11:42,635
Bob Kay: Ahhhh!


302
0:11:42,635 --> 0:11:44,403
Johan Nurmi: So you
have no problem get fuel.


303
0:11:44,403 --> 0:11:46,439
Something happens; I'll
be there in five minutes.


304
0:11:46,439 --> 0:11:47,74
I'll rescue you.


305
0:11:47,74 --> 0:11:49,542
Land outside your
driveway and off we go.


306
0:11:49,542 --> 0:11:50,943
Bob Kay: This looks
like the way to go.


307
0:11:50,943 --> 0:11:56,682
Looks like it has plenty
of room, so how much?


308
0:11:56,682 --> 0:11:58,35
Jade Kay: You
actually purchased


309
0:11:58,35 --> 0:11:59,685
a helicopter, or?


310
0:11:59,685 --> 0:12:4,23
Okay, how much, how much
does the helicopter cost?


311
0:12:4,23 --> 0:12:5,357
Bob Kay: About half
a million dollars.


312
0:12:5,357 --> 0:12:6,292
Jade Kay: What?


313
0:12:6,292 --> 0:12:8,327
Half a million dollars
for helicopter?


314
0:12:8,327 --> 0:12:9,795
Bob Kay: Well, you
gotta let me tell


315
0:12:9,795 --> 0:12:10,963
you the rest
of it though.


316
0:12:10,963 --> 0:12:12,31
We're going to
do a test run.


317
0:12:12,31 --> 0:12:13,432
We're gonna have a
helicopter come here.


318
0:12:13,432 --> 0:12:15,534
We can land it out
here, right out here.


319
0:12:15,534 --> 0:12:16,936
We should give
it a try.


320
0:12:16,936 --> 0:12:18,537
Keeping in mind that
there are about a quarter


321
0:12:18,537 --> 0:12:20,539
of a million people
living in this area and


322
0:12:20,539 --> 0:12:23,109
bugging out isn't
necessarily the


323
0:12:23,109 --> 0:12:24,41
easiest thing to do.


324
0:12:24,41 --> 0:12:26,545
One highway in,
one highway out.


325
0:12:26,545 --> 0:12:28,681
The advantages of
using some type of


326
0:12:28,681 --> 0:12:31,917
air transport, helicopter,
allows one to take off


327
0:12:31,917 --> 0:12:33,919
and land in a
very small area.


328
0:12:33,919 --> 0:12:35,354
It's a tremendous
advantage.


329
0:12:35,354 --> 0:12:36,789
A little bit
pricey way to go,


330
0:12:36,789 --> 0:12:40,893
but it does deliver
on the solution.


331
0:12:40,893 --> 0:12:43,162
My wife does view many
of the activities


332
0:12:43,162 --> 0:12:47,967
that I engage in for
prepping with amusement.


333
0:12:47,967 --> 0:12:50,736
The truth of the matter
is she does understand


334
0:12:50,736 --> 0:12:52,505
the type of environment
we live in.


335
0:12:52,505 --> 0:12:54,34
We've experienced
several earthquakes.


336
0:12:54,34 --> 0:12:57,9
So she does
appreciate truly that


337
0:12:57,9 --> 0:12:58,878
being prepared
is important.


338
0:12:58,878 --> 0:13:1,814
To me, major earthquake,
if it was a matter of


339
0:13:1,814 --> 0:13:3,983
money to save my
family's lives and


340
0:13:3,983 --> 0:13:5,618
take care of
their well being,


341
0:13:5,618 --> 0:13:14,93
show me where I
stick the debit card.


342
0:13:14,93 --> 0:13:15,394
<i> Narrator: Bob,

<i> Your gardens, orchard,

<i> family over an extended
 period of time.</i>


347
0:13:24,603 --> 0:13:27,473
<i> However, currently you
 lack sources of protein.</i>


348
0:13:27,473 --> 0:13:29,108
<i> The experts recommend
 you start raising</i>


349
0:13:29,108 --> 0:13:31,143
<i> chickens and rabbits.</i>


350
0:13:31,143 --> 0:13:33,445
Bob Kay: I think we need
to find an alternative


351
0:13:33,445 --> 0:13:36,415
and I think the stores
that we can purchase


352
0:13:36,415 --> 0:13:37,783
that are freeze
dried would be an


353
0:13:37,783 --> 0:13:39,618
excellent alternative.

0:13:39,618 --> 0:13:41,42
<i> Narrator: Your

356
0:13:43,389 --> 0:13:45,191

Bob Kay: We had thought
about drilling a well.


360
0:13:51,931 --> 0:13:53,399
We tried to
get permits;


361
0:13:53,399 --> 0:13:55,201
not allowed because
the water rights


362
0:13:55,201 --> 0:13:58,838
are not ours.

Bob Kay: I agree with

0:14:36,408 --> 0:14:37,676
left out a
critical factor:


378
0:14:37,676 --> 0:14:39,645
our ability to have
business activities


379
0:14:39,645 --> 0:14:42,414
and barter and
increase our ability


380
0:14:42,414 --> 0:14:46,485

period of time.


381
0:14:46,485 --> 0:14:48,12

<i> his family and

399
0:15:45,878 --> 0:15:47,947
Josh Wander: A
normal day in my life


400
0:15:47,947 --> 0:15:50,449
starts off around
6:30 in the morning


401
0:15:50,449 --> 0:15:52,985
where I go to
pray in synagogue.


402
0:15:52,985 --> 0:15:55,454
After that, I start
my campaigning.


403
0:15:55,454 --> 0:15:57,99
Thanks,
thank you.


404
0:15:57,99 --> 0:16:0,225
<i> Narrator: Each day, Josh

405
0:16:0,225 --> 0:16:2,761
<i> for city council,

0:16:2,761 --> 0:16:6,31
<i> and fulfills his

407
0:16:6,31 --> 0:16:8,167
<i> But every moment

408
0:16:8,167 --> 0:16:13,572
<i> his kids, and politics,

409
0:16:13,572 --> 0:16:14,94
Josh Wander: I'm
preparing for a


410
0:16:14,94 --> 0:16:17,276
series of catastrophic
terrorist attacks,


411
0:16:17,276 --> 0:16:18,677
which will
fundamentally change


412
0:16:18,677 --> 0:16:29,188
our lives as
we know it.


413
0:16:29,188 --> 0:16:31,657
Terrorist attacks are
just a way of life


414
0:16:31,657 --> 0:16:34,293
and something that's
necessary to prepare for.


415
0:16:34,293 --> 0:16:37,696
It wouldn't be difficult
for terrorists to blow


416
0:16:37,696 --> 0:16:40,599
themselves up in suicide
bombs in major cities,


417
0:16:40,599 --> 0:16:43,836
buses, in malls throughout
the United States.


418
0:16:43,836 --> 0:16:45,671
There would be
continuous attacks on


419
0:16:45,671 --> 0:16:48,14
these locations over
and over again.


420
0:16:48,14 --> 0:16:51,543
Police, firemen, and
the paramedics would


421
0:16:51,543 --> 0:16:52,611
come to respond.


422
0:16:52,611 --> 0:16:55,647
There would be additional
attacks as soon as the


423
0:16:55,647 --> 0:16:58,25
first responders
would come that would


424
0:16:58,25 --> 0:16:59,885
kill and maim
those people.


425
0:16:59,885 --> 0:17:1,82
This is something
that was perfected in


426
0:17:1,82 --> 0:17:3,389
the Middle East.


427
0:17:3,389 --> 0:17:6,458
People would be afraid to
use mass transportation;


428
0:17:6,458 --> 0:17:9,395
afraid to go to stores
for fear that there


429
0:17:9,395 --> 0:17:11,13
would be
continuous attacks.


430
0:17:11,13 --> 0:17:13,766
People would be stuck
in their homes in fear


431
0:17:13,766 --> 0:17:17,836
without the ability to
bring in new resources.


432
0:17:17,836 --> 0:17:20,5
Once that happened
there's going to be


433
0:17:20,5 --> 0:17:21,94
a lot of people
dying very quickly.


434
0:17:21,94 --> 0:17:23,675
<i> Narrator: Josh is
 running for a seat</i>


435
0:17:23,675 --> 0:17:25,411
<i> on Pittsburgh's
 city council.</i>


436
0:17:25,411 --> 0:17:27,413
<i> But, unlike his

<i> could happen at
 any moment,</i>


441
0:17:34,887 --> 0:17:37,256
<i> so he wants the entire
 city of Pittsburgh</i>


442
0:17:37,256 --> 0:17:39,324
<i> to begin prepping.</i>


443
0:17:39,324 --> 0:17:40,793
Josh Wander: As
a politician,


444
0:17:40,793 --> 0:17:42,294
I'm looking at the
welfare of the


445
0:17:42,294 --> 0:17:43,362
greater community.


446
0:17:43,362 --> 0:17:45,597
I educate
people on the


447
0:17:45,597 --> 0:17:47,332
importance of
preparedness.


448
0:17:47,332 --> 0:17:49,34
What's motivating me
to run for Pittsburgh


449
0:17:49,34 --> 0:17:51,637
city council is that
fact that there is


450
0:17:51,637 --> 0:17:53,172
no preparedness
at all.


451
0:17:53,172 --> 0:17:54,239
People are not
listening.


452
0:17:54,239 --> 0:17:56,108
What we need is somebody
who's going to stand up


453
0:17:56,108 --> 0:17:58,77
and legislate and
explain that there has


454
0:17:58,77 --> 0:17:59,912
to be required
education.


455
0:17:59,912 --> 0:18:1,48
David Raphael: You
see these people now


456
0:18:1,48 --> 0:18:3,148
worried about you know,
building bunkers.


457
0:18:3,148 --> 0:18:4,583
Everyone's building
bunkers now.


458
0:18:4,583 --> 0:18:6,151
And that's cool and
if I had the money,


459
0:18:6,151 --> 0:18:7,352
I'd build
a bunker.


460
0:18:7,352 --> 0:18:8,587
Like that,
that's great.


461
0:18:8,587 --> 0:18:10,255
I think it would be
nice to have someone


462
0:18:10,255 --> 0:18:13,992
involved in government
that wants to be prepared.


463
0:18:13,992 --> 0:18:16,428
I would vote for Josh
Wander unconditionally.


464
0:18:16,428 --> 0:18:17,996
<i> Narrator: Josh

465
0:18:17,996 --> 0:18:19,731
<i> like himself will

<i> terrorists attack and
 he fears one of his</i>


467
0:18:21,934 --> 0:18:24,736
<i> own political rallies
 could soon be the scene of</i>


468
0:18:24,736 --> 0:18:27,406
<i> a massacre aimed
 at silencing him.</i>


469
0:18:27,406 --> 0:18:29,408
<i> In the last year, the
 number of government</i>


470
0:18:29,408 --> 0:18:31,31
<i> officials killed in
 terrorist attacks</i>


471
0:18:31,31 --> 0:18:34,346
<i> worldwide increased
 more than 13 percent.</i>


472
0:18:34,346 --> 0:18:36,515
<i> So today, he's putting
 his staff through</i>


473
0:18:36,515 --> 0:18:38,484
<i> their first mass
 casualty drill.</i>


474
0:18:38,484 --> 0:18:40,18
Josh Wander: Let's
get bloodied up.


475
0:18:40,18 --> 0:18:42,2
It's a misnomer
that people


476
0:18:42,2 --> 0:18:43,622
panic during
attacks.


477
0:18:43,622 --> 0:18:45,224
Instead you find
that people just


478
0:18:45,224 --> 0:18:47,392
shut down and
they don't move.


479
0:18:47,392 --> 0:18:48,927
<i> Narrator: In a

482
0:18:52,798 --> 0:18:55,534

<i> to acting in a crisis

486
0:19:2,875 --> 0:19:5,777
<i> of carnage as
 realistic as possible.</i>


487
0:19:5,777 --> 0:19:7,846
Josh Wander: Doing
something repetitively


488
0:19:7,846 --> 0:19:10,682
ingrains it into you,
so that when something


489
0:19:10,682 --> 0:19:12,851
actually happens you
won't break down.


490
0:19:12,851 --> 0:19:15,87
<i> Narrator: Josh was trained
 as an EMS responder</i>


491
0:19:15,87 --> 0:19:17,122
<i> in Jerusalem and
 witnessed the impact</i>


492
0:19:17,122 --> 0:19:19,558
<i> of suicide bombings
 first hand.</i>


493
0:19:19,558 --> 0:19:21,36
<i> Terrorist attacks

<i> exploding once emergency
 responders arrive,</i>


496
0:19:26,165 --> 0:19:28,5
<i> to prevent people
 from receiving care.</i>


497
0:19:28,5 --> 0:19:31,36
<i> So Josh is training
 his team to secure</i>


498
0:19:31,36 --> 0:19:33,639
<i> the perimeter before
 attending to any victims.</i>


499
0:19:33,639 --> 0:19:35,4
Josh Wander: I want
all three of you to


500
0:19:35,4 --> 0:19:36,308
make a perimeter,

Josh Wander: Okay,
it seems safe.


505
0:19:43,248 --> 0:19:44,683
Now let's start
treating them.

Joe: He's breathing,
pulse is rapid.


507
0:19:48,887 --> 0:19:50,522
All right, let's
red tag him.

<i> Narrator: Each victim

<i> Narrator: And black.</i>


517

Joe: No pulse,
no breathing.


518
0:20:6,405 --> 0:20:8,273
He's a black
tag, he's gone.


519
0:20:8,273 --> 0:20:9,841
Let's get help to
the other people.


520
0:20:9,841 --> 0:20:11,276
Josh Wander: We
put an enormous


521
0:20:11,276 --> 0:20:12,644
amount of
sanctity on life.


522
0:20:12,644 --> 0:20:17,416
We need to just save as
many lives as possible.


523
0:20:17,416 --> 0:20:19,51
This is exactly
why I'm a prepper.


524
0:20:19,51 --> 0:20:21,453
Because I think
that the survival


525
0:20:21,453 --> 0:20:23,188
of my family,
friends, supporters,


526
0:20:23,188 --> 0:20:31,296

responsibility.

<i> every aspect of

529
0:20:36,235 --> 0:20:38,637
<i> But can he prepare his

<i> terrorist attacks
 he fears without</i>

0:20:41,473 --> 0:20:49,948
<i> having to
 disobey God?</i>


532
0:20:49,948 --> 0:20:52,651
<i> Narrator: Josh Wander is
 a Pittsburgh politician</i>


533
0:20:52,651 --> 0:20:54,886

<i> remain in their homes

<i> what they
 have on hand.</i>


539
0:21:5,397 --> 0:21:7,266
<i> So Josh is

<i> for at least
 three months.</i>


541
0:21:8,634 --> 0:21:11,536
Josh Wander: Urban
centers would be targeted


542
0:21:11,536 --> 0:21:13,105
in any terrorist
attack.


543
0:21:13,105 --> 0:21:15,407
It would make most
sense to basically


544
0:21:15,407 --> 0:21:17,576
stay put for a
period of time.


545
0:21:17,576 --> 0:21:19,544

Josh Wander: We
have to keep kosher.


550
0:21:29,421 --> 0:21:31,456
So our food
preparations have to

0:21:31,456 --> 0:21:33,325
be all certified kosher.

0:21:45,237 --> 0:21:46,805
Josh Wander:
Matzah, I believe,


559
0:21:46,805 --> 0:21:49,741
is actually the
ultimate prepper food.


560
0:21:49,741 --> 0:21:51,576
<i> Narrator: Unleavened
 bread made only from</i>


561
0:21:51,576 --> 0:21:53,745
<i> flour and water,
 Matzah is a source of</i>


562
0:21:53,745 --> 0:21:55,847
<i> protein and
 carbohydrates and has</i>


563
0:21:55,847 --> 0:21:57,949
<i> a two and half
 year shelf life.</i>


564
0:21:57,949 --> 0:21:59,985
Josh Wander: I've seen
these boxes be opened


565
0:21:59,985 --> 0:22:3,388
years after its expiration
and it's still fresh.


566
0:22:3,388 --> 0:22:5,891
<i> Narrator: Josh also has
 a dozen cases of kosher</i>


567
0:22:5,891 --> 0:22:10,829
<i> MRE's, enough for 144
 1,200-calorie meals,</i>


568
0:22:10,829 --> 0:22:12,397
<i> which have been
 cooked and</i>


569
0:22:12,397 --> 0:22:13,999
<i> packaged under
 rabbinical supervision,</i>


570
0:22:13,999 --> 0:22:16,968
<i> and can last up
 to five years.</i>


571
0:22:16,968 --> 0:22:19,638
Josh Wander: Kosher
MRE's are specifically


572
0:22:19,638 --> 0:22:23,742
made for Orthodox Jews
who are in the military.


573
0:22:23,742 --> 0:22:26,111
They are U.S.
military rations,


574
0:22:26,111 --> 0:22:29,147
and they are
completely kosher.


575
0:22:29,147 --> 0:22:31,717
<i> Narrator: Having served in
 the Israeli defense forces,</i>


576
0:22:31,717 --> 0:22:34,286
<i> Josh has experience
 surviving off MRE's.</i>


577
0:22:34,286 --> 0:22:35,887
<i> But his
 children don't.</i>


578
0:22:35,887 --> 0:22:37,856
<i> So today, he's giving
 them a taste of what</i>


579
0:22:37,856 --> 0:22:40,58
<i> they'll be in for, if
 multiple terrorist</i>


580
0:22:40,58 --> 0:22:42,16
<i> attacks confine
 them to their home.</i>


581
0:22:42,16 --> 0:22:44,529
Josh Wander: You're gonna
pour in just a drop, okay?


582
0:22:44,529 --> 0:22:46,231
<i> Narrator: The heater
 pouch is filled with</i>


583
0:22:46,231 --> 0:22:47,933
<i> iron and
 magnesium dust.</i>


584
0:22:47,933 --> 0:22:49,968
<i> When they come in
 contact with water they</i>


585
0:22:49,968 --> 0:22:52,371
<i> begin to rust, and
 the rapid oxidation</i>


586
0:22:52,371 --> 0:22:53,972
<i> generates heat.</i>


587
0:22:53,972 --> 0:22:55,374
Josh Wander:
Feel it, Sara?


588
0:22:55,374 --> 0:22:56,575
That's how the
chemicals work.


589
0:22:56,575 --> 0:22:57,676
Feel how
hot it is?


590
0:22:57,676 --> 0:22:59,44
Josh Wander:
Baruch atah adonai,


591
0:22:59,44 --> 0:23:2,714
elohenu melech ha'olam,
borei mi nay mazanos.


592
0:23:2,714 --> 0:23:4,983
Tamara: Ewww, it
looks like barf.


593
0:23:4,983 --> 0:23:7,452
Sara: It looks like barf.


594
0:23:7,452 --> 0:23:8,653
Josh Wander:
Not bad.


595
0:23:8,653 --> 0:23:10,21
Make a mazanos close
your eyes and eat it,


596
0:23:10,21 --> 0:23:10,956
come on.


597
0:23:10,956 --> 0:23:12,257
Tamara: No.


598
0:23:12,257 --> 0:23:13,158
Josh Wander:
Come on.


599
0:23:13,158 --> 0:23:15,16
Tamara: No!


600
0:23:15,16 --> 0:23:18,96
Josh Wander: Corn
and, and carrots.


601
0:23:18,96 --> 0:23:19,231
No?


602
0:23:19,231 --> 0:23:21,32
That's just 'cause your
sister told you not to,


603
0:23:21,32 --> 0:23:21,933
right?


604
0:23:21,933 --> 0:23:23,235
Cause you were
about to do it.


605
0:23:23,235 --> 0:23:24,603
<i> Narrator: Josh's
 current store of kosher</i>


606
0:23:24,603 --> 0:23:26,438
<i> supplies should
 last 90 days.</i>


607
0:23:26,438 --> 0:23:28,673
<i> But he fears wave after
 wave of terrorist</i>

<i> attacks could keep
 Pittsburgh under siege</i>


609
0:23:30,876 --> 0:23:32,31
<i> longer than
 three months.</i>


610
0:23:32,31 --> 0:23:34,112
Josh Wander: Whoever has a
bite of this can have a treat.


611
0:23:34,112 --> 0:23:35,38
Who's gonna have it?


612
0:23:35,38 --> 0:23:36,848
<i> Narrator: If that
 were to happen,</i>


613
0:23:36,848 --> 0:23:38,517
<i> Josh believes he'd
 eventually be forced to</i>


614
0:23:38,517 --> 0:23:40,352
<i> choose between
 keeping kosher and</i>


615
0:23:40,352 --> 0:23:41,853
<i> staying alive.</i>


616
0:23:41,853 --> 0:23:43,522
Josh Wander: There
are 613 commandments


617
0:23:43,522 --> 0:23:44,89
in the Torah.


618
0:23:44,89 --> 0:23:48,93
We are instructed to
break any of those


619
0:23:48,93 --> 0:23:50,762
rules in order
to save life.


620
0:23:50,762 --> 0:23:53,98
If necessary we
could eat pork,


621
0:23:53,98 --> 0:23:54,866
we could eat
shellfish or


622
0:23:54,866 --> 0:23:57,35
any other non-kosher
species for


623
0:23:57,35 --> 0:23:58,537
the preservation
of life.


624
0:23:58,537 --> 0:24:0,705
Under normal
circumstances is


625
0:24:0,705 --> 0:24:2,441
a rabbit kosher?


626
0:24:2,441 --> 0:24:3,875
Daughter: No.


627
0:24:3,875 --> 0:24:5,11
Josh Wander: Right?


628
0:24:5,11 --> 0:24:6,478
Rabbits are
not kosher.


629
0:24:6,478 --> 0:24:7,846
In fact, it says
in the bible,


630
0:24:7,846 --> 0:24:9,514
it mentions rabbits as
one of the species


631
0:24:9,514 --> 0:24:11,82
which is not kosher.


632
0:24:11,82 --> 0:24:12,717
<i> Narrator: Because
 these rabbits are</i>


633
0:24:12,717 --> 0:24:14,19
<i> raised to be dinner,</i>


634
0:24:14,19 --> 0:24:16,555
<i> Josh won't allow his
 children to give them names.</i>


635
0:24:16,555 --> 0:24:17,889
Josh Wander:
They're not pets.


636
0:24:17,889 --> 0:24:20,459
We do play with them,
but they understand


637
0:24:20,459 --> 0:24:23,528
that they're eventually
going to be used for food.


638
0:24:23,528 --> 0:24:24,796
Tamara: I think
it's disgusting.


639
0:24:24,796 --> 0:24:25,997
Josh Wander:
It's disgusting?


640
0:24:25,997 --> 0:24:27,466
But it's better
than dying right?


641
0:24:27,466 --> 0:24:28,5
Tamara: No.


642
0:24:28,5 --> 0:24:29,701
Josh Wander: I don't
feel conflicted at all


643
0:24:29,701 --> 0:24:32,804
once we've finished all
of our kosher options


644
0:24:32,804 --> 0:24:35,474
it smoothly transitions to
whatever's out there and,


645
0:24:35,474 --> 0:24:37,175
that's necessary
to preserve life.


646
0:24:37,175 --> 0:24:38,91
<i> Narrator: Keeping kosher
 isn't the only Jewish</i>


647
0:24:38,91 --> 0:24:40,912
<i> tradition Josh may
 have to break with in</i>


648
0:24:40,912 --> 0:24:42,714
<i> order to keep his
 family alive.</i>


649
0:24:42,714 --> 0:24:44,516
<i> If terrorism comes
 to Pittsburgh,</i>


650
0:24:44,516 --> 0:24:46,952
<i> Josh and his children
 are willing to do</i>


651
0:24:46,952 --> 0:24:49,187
<i> whatever it takes to
 protect themselves.</i>


652
0:24:49,187 --> 0:24:51,89
Josh Wander: Jewish law
is clear that we are


653
0:24:51,89 --> 0:24:54,759
obligated to defend
ourselves to the


654
0:24:54,759 --> 0:24:57,696
point of using
lethal force in order


655
0:24:57,696 --> 0:24:59,97
to preserve our lives.


656
0:24:59,97 --> 0:25:1,9
<i> Narrator: Today, Josh
 is taking Hannah and</i>


657
0:25:1,9 --> 0:25:3,835
<i> Etan to their local
 shooting range.</i>


658
0:25:3,835 --> 0:25:6,4
<i> As a certified
 NRA instructor,</i>


659
0:25:6,4 --> 0:25:8,306
<i> Josh makes sure they
 practice once a week,</i>


660
0:25:8,306 --> 0:25:10,208
<i> so that their shooting
 skills are honed</i>


661
0:25:10,208 --> 0:25:12,844
<i> in case of an onslaught
 of terrorist attacks.</i>


662
0:25:12,844 --> 0:25:14,112
Josh Wander: Now look
between these two


663
0:25:14,112 --> 0:25:15,247
and this and
see the read.


664
0:25:15,247 --> 0:25:16,715
Okay, whenever
you're ready put the


665
0:25:16,715 --> 0:25:17,983
finger in and
slowly pull once.


666
0:25:17,983 --> 0:25:18,884
<i> [gunshot].</i>


667
0:25:18,884 --> 0:25:20,85
Slowly, slowly, that
was way too fast.


668
0:25:20,85 --> 0:25:22,554
Continue to
look through it.


669
0:25:22,554 --> 0:25:24,556
Relax, relax.


670
0:25:24,556 --> 0:25:25,69
<i> [gunshot].</i>


671
0:25:25,69 --> 0:25:28,76
Good, perfect.


672
0:25:28,76 --> 0:25:32,597
Deep breath, relax, lean
forward a little bit.


673
0:25:32,597 --> 0:25:33,732
<i> [gunshot].</i>


674
0:25:33,732 --> 0:25:35,934
Most children out there
know to pick up a phone


675
0:25:35,934 --> 0:25:38,537
and dial 911,
unfortunately very few


676
0:25:38,537 --> 0:25:40,772
know what to do when they
pick up the phone and


677
0:25:40,772 --> 0:25:46,378
there's no dial tone
on the other end.


678
0:25:46,378 --> 0:25:48,513
<i> Narrator: As much as
 Josh loves Pittsburgh,</i>


679
0:25:48,513 --> 0:25:50,382
<i> he believes it's
 possible that,</i>


680
0:25:50,382 --> 0:25:52,284
<i> in the wake of
 terrorist attacks and</i>


681
0:25:52,284 --> 0:25:54,119
<i> subsequent looting,
 their home could</i>


682
0:25:54,119 --> 0:25:55,82
<i> no longer be
 a safe haven.</i>


683
0:25:55,82 --> 0:25:58,156
<i> So if the terrorists
 gain the upper hand,</i>


684
0:25:58,156 --> 0:25:59,925
<i> Josh has a plan.</i>


685
0:25:59,925 --> 0:26:1,259
Josh Wander: We
would have to get


686
0:26:1,259 --> 0:26:3,695
out from this
urban death trap.


687
0:26:3,695 --> 0:26:5,397
We would definitely
be bugging out


688
0:26:5,397 --> 0:26:7,599
to a remote location.


689
0:26:7,599 --> 0:26:9,2
If they're woken up in
the middle of the night,


690
0:26:9,2 --> 0:26:10,902
they know to bug out.


691
0:26:10,902 --> 0:26:13,638
It's something that we
constantly work on.


692
0:26:13,638 --> 0:26:14,739
We're bugging out!


693
0:26:14,739 --> 0:26:16,608
<i> Narrator: Josh's
 15-passenger van</i>


694
0:26:16,608 --> 0:26:18,143
<i> is large enough to
 fit his family</i>


695
0:26:18,143 --> 0:26:21,613
<i> of eight and
 some supplies.</i>


696
0:26:21,613 --> 0:26:23,949
<i> His plan is to camp
 in a wooded area,</i>


697
0:26:23,949 --> 0:26:26,84
<i> where he hopes he can
 remain camouflaged</i>


698
0:26:26,84 --> 0:26:27,919
<i> until he can determine
 his family's safest</i>


699
0:26:27,919 --> 0:26:31,99
<i> route out of the city.</i>


700
0:26:31,99 --> 0:26:34,826
Josh Wander: We're
headed into the forest


701
0:26:34,826 --> 0:26:39,3
in order to reassess
the situation.


702
0:26:39,3 --> 0:26:41,232
The relationship
between Judaism and


703
0:26:41,232 --> 0:26:43,435
prepping is
very strong.


704
0:26:43,435 --> 0:26:45,971
Jewish communities
throughout the millennia


705
0:26:45,971 --> 0:26:48,34
have been required
to bug out.


706
0:26:48,34 --> 0:26:51,76
The Exodus was a
form of a bug out.


707
0:26:51,76 --> 0:26:53,445
They were forced to very
quickly pick up their


708
0:26:53,445 --> 0:26:55,814
things and marched out of
Egypt to the Holy Land.


709
0:26:55,814 --> 0:26:57,716
Moses did what was
necessary for himself


710
0:26:57,716 --> 0:27:0,285
and his nation in
order to survive.


711
0:27:0,285 --> 0:27:3,154
Just like any other time
in world history the ones


712
0:27:3,154 --> 0:27:11,196
that are gonna survive are
those that are prepared.


713
0:27:11,196 --> 0:27:17,35
The ultimate
prepper food.


714
0:27:17,35 --> 0:27:18,269
<i> Narrator: Josh,
 the experts,</i>


715
0:27:18,269 --> 0:27:20,939
<i> Practical Preppers have
 reviewed your preps.</i>


716
0:27:20,939 --> 0:27:23,742
<i> Your rainwater catchment
 barrels are a good idea;</i>


717
0:27:23,742 --> 0:27:25,11
<i> however, you
 should consider</i>


718
0:27:25,11 --> 0:27:26,745
<i> storing more water.</i>


719
0:27:26,745 --> 0:27:30,415
<i> 250 gallons is not enough
 for a family of eight.</i>


720
0:27:30,415 --> 0:27:31,95
Josh Wander: 250
gallons is just the


721
0:27:31,95 --> 0:27:33,351
beginning of our preps.


722
0:27:33,351 --> 0:27:36,321
I think we have plenty
of water to go around.


723
0:27:36,321 --> 0:27:37,689
<i> Narrator: We suggest
 that you include</i>


724
0:27:37,689 --> 0:27:38,957
<i> others in your plans.</i>


725
0:27:38,957 --> 0:27:40,325
<i> In an urban
 environment,</i>


726
0:27:40,325 --> 0:27:42,861
<i> you will find your greatest
 strength in numbers.</i>


727
0:27:42,861 --> 0:27:44,229
Josh Wander: There's a
lot that we've learned


728
0:27:44,229 --> 0:27:45,93
through our military
experience.


729
0:27:45,93 --> 0:27:47,699
One of the things
that we've learned is


730
0:27:47,699 --> 0:27:49,367
the fact that in
order to improve you


731
0:27:49,367 --> 0:27:51,369
have to hear the
negative as well.


732
0:27:51,369 --> 0:27:53,371
<i> Narrator: To determine how
 long you could initially</i>


733
0:27:53,371 --> 0:27:55,707
<i> survive a catastrophe,
 Practical Preppers has</i>


734
0:27:55,707 --> 0:27:58,309
<i> scored your preps in
 five categories of</i>


735
0:27:58,309 --> 0:28:3,548
<i> 20 points each, for a total
 possible score of 100.</i>


736
0:28:3,548 --> 0:28:5,684
<i> You need a more
 complete food plan:</i>


737
0:28:5,684 --> 0:28:7,585
<i> 11 out of
 20 points.</i>


738
0:28:7,585 --> 0:28:10,588
<i> Water: 14 out

739
0:28:10,588 --> 0:28:13,558
<i> Shelter: 12 out

Josh Wander: Well, a 70 is
generally a passing grade,


749
0:28:37,15 --> 0:28:38,683
but I'm not
satisfied with it.


750
0:28:38,683 --> 0:28:41,72
I would say that it's
necessary to do better


751
0:28:41,72 --> 0:28:44,255
and we're always
looking at ways that


752
0:28:44,255 --> 0:28:47,659
we can better
ourselves.

754
0:28:50,228 --> 0:28:53,298

lot worse in this country.

our world is not okay

788

There aren't

790
0:30:35,733 --> 0:30:36,768
Uh-huh.


791
0:30:36,768 --> 0:30:38,937
Can FEMA arrive in a
thousand cities at once?


792
0:30:38,937 --> 0:30:40,238
Nuh-uh.


793
0:30:40,238 --> 0:30:41,439
So who are they
going to show up for?


794
0:30:41,439 --> 0:30:43,341
You, me?


795
0:30:43,341 --> 0:30:47,412
That's where the
prepper steps in.


796

799
0:30:54,52 --> 0:31:3,94

<i> it'll take society

803

Ryan Croft: The

804
0:31:12,7 --> 0:31:14,405
is completely
artificial.


805
0:31:14,405 --> 0:31:16,574
Our financial collapse
has already started.


806
0:31:16,574 --> 0:31:19,744
We're just in the
gentle glide of


807
0:31:19,744 --> 0:31:21,312
the collapse
right now.


808
0:31:21,312 --> 0:31:22,847
How close are we?


809
0:31:22,847 --> 0:31:25,149
The only reason why it
keeps going forward


810
0:31:25,149 --> 0:31:27,418
is because of
consumer confidence.


811
0:31:27,418 --> 0:31:29,921
You knock consumer
confidence out of the way;


812
0:31:29,921 --> 0:31:32,323
you've got chaos
in different and


813
0:31:32,323 --> 0:31:34,592

not going anywhere.

we love these people.

Spirulina.


836
0:32:22,407 --> 0:32:28,46
Spirulina alone promises
to take starvation


837
0:32:28,46 --> 0:32:30,515
out of any crisis
in the world.

into this tank
do anyway?


846
0:32:50,34 --> 0:32:51,636
Ryan Croft: Agitation
is really good


847
0:32:51,636 --> 0:32:54,5
for the solution
but also you are


848
0:32:54,5 --> 0:32:56,174
introducing carbon
dioxide and oxygen.


849
0:32:56,174 --> 0:33:1,79
It loves carbon
dioxide.


850
0:33:1,79 --> 0:33:3,414
The best way to
harvest Spirulina is


851
0:33:3,414 --> 0:33:5,16
to just put
a tube in.


852
0:33:5,16 --> 0:33:7,585
Almost like
siphoning gasoline.


853
0:33:7,585 --> 0:33:9,287
I mean, you can eat
it right off the


854
0:33:9,287 --> 0:33:10,421
filter cloth if
you wanted to.


855
0:33:10,421 --> 0:33:11,622
It's like a
buttery,


856
0:33:11,622 --> 0:33:13,524
almost tasteless
substance.


857
0:33:13,524 --> 0:33:16,561
You need about five to
10 grams of it daily


858
0:33:16,561 --> 0:33:20,131
to get a good nutritive
supplemental supply.


859
0:33:20,131 --> 0:33:21,532
If you want to
live on it alone,


860
0:33:21,532 --> 0:33:23,267
probably 20
grams a day.

<i> Narrator: Ryan thinks

<i> can produce up to five grams
 of Spirulina each day.</i>


863
0:33:29,974 --> 0:33:32,143

<i> farms throughout town.</i>


870
0:33:45,623 --> 0:33:46,991
Ryan Croft: Your
number one resource


871
0:33:46,991 --> 0:33:49,6
should be people.


872
0:33:49,6 --> 0:33:52,23
And that is not on most
people's preppers list.


873
0:33:52,23 --> 0:33:54,432
They think that means
I've got a doctor.


874
0:33:54,432 --> 0:33:57,1
I've got a tactician,
I've got an engineer;


875
0:33:57,1 --> 0:34:1,973
that's not people,
those are jobs.


876
0:34:1,973 --> 0:34:4,475
We'd like to select
maybe a half a dozen


877
0:34:4,475 --> 0:34:6,477
people that we can
actually spread this


878
0:34:6,477 --> 0:34:10,148
Spirulina tech to right
away so that we have


879
0:34:10,148 --> 0:34:13,484
got 100 to 150
gallons on hand fully


880
0:34:13,484 --> 0:34:16,287
mature and available.


881
0:34:16,287 --> 0:34:18,656
You only need about 15
milliliters to go in,


882
0:34:18,656 --> 0:34:19,991
start a new colony.


883
0:34:19,991 --> 0:34:22,86
So we'd have the
resources to set up about


884
0:34:22,86 --> 0:34:25,663
1,000 little
microfarms.


885
0:34:25,663 --> 0:34:27,665
I believe that the
people with the greatest


886
0:34:27,665 --> 0:34:30,201
chance of survival
are those that can


887
0:34:30,201 --> 0:34:32,36
genuinely stick
together.


888
0:34:32,36 --> 0:34:34,639
I'm talkin' about
regionally stick together,


889
0:34:34,639 --> 0:34:36,941
I don't mean your
little 20-person group.


890
0:34:36,941 --> 0:34:38,509
That's not enough.


891
0:34:38,509 --> 0:34:42,346
You need as many
people as you can to


892
0:34:42,346 --> 0:34:43,815
have the same
objective.


893
0:34:43,815 --> 0:34:47,85
And that is to stay alive
with one condition:


894
0:34:47,85 --> 0:34:49,821
Everyone lives,
no one dies.


895
0:34:49,821 --> 0:34:51,889

you with an entire

0:35:7,38 --> 0:35:8,606
high quality protein.


904
0:35:8,606 --> 0:35:10,541
You'll have a thousand
or 2 or 3,000 of


905
0:35:10,541 --> 0:35:12,41
them in the average
American yard.


906
0:35:12,41 --> 0:35:14,712
Once you hit
about 3,000 worms,


907
0:35:14,712 --> 0:35:17,482
you're always going
to have worms.

0:35:44,41 --> 0:35:47,278
kids because morale
and mindset is


923
0:35:47,278 --> 0:35:49,58
a huge component
to survival.


924
0:35:49,58 --> 0:35:51,549
So long as you don't
think it's a worm,


925
0:35:51,549 --> 0:35:52,817
it's a lot
easier on the mind.


926
0:35:52,817 --> 0:35:54,385
<i> Narrator: Earthworms
 provide a comparable</i>


927
0:35:54,385 --> 0:35:56,154
<i> amount of protein you
 can get eating eggs or</i>


928
0:35:56,154 --> 0:35:58,556

 consumed regularly in</i>

0:35:58,556 --> 0:36:1,526
<i> almost 90 countries.</i>


930
0:36:1,526 --> 0:36:8,199
<i> Ryan prefers his
 with hot sauce.</i>


931
0:36:8,199 --> 0:36:9,867
Ryan Croft: Hot sauce
goes a long way with


932
0:36:9,867 --> 0:36:12,47
helping you eat things
you normally wouldn't eat.


933
0:36:12,47 --> 0:36:13,437
Alex: Corbin!


934
0:36:13,437 --> 0:36:15,506
I'll pick one out
for you, a good one.


935
0:36:15,506 --> 0:36:17,208
We'll give you
this little guy.


936
0:36:17,208 --> 0:36:19,71
Hold him,
clean him off.


937
0:36:19,71 --> 0:36:25,16
Corbin: This
is so crazy.


938
0:36:25,16 --> 0:36:25,883
Alex: No sauce.


939
0:36:25,883 --> 0:36:27,218
He's straight
up, he's a man.


940
0:36:27,218 --> 0:36:28,619
Tom: Oh, you're
the man.


941
0:36:28,619 --> 0:36:31,422
Ryan Croft: Tastes
like dirt, huh?


942
0:36:31,422 --> 0:36:32,29
Corbin: Yeah.


943
0:36:32,29 --> 0:36:33,891
Tom: Wow, nice.


944
0:36:33,891 --> 0:36:35,126
Good man!


945
0:36:35,126 --> 0:36:38,129
You did well, I'm
proud of you boy.


946
0:36:38,129 --> 0:36:39,397
Corbin: I would have
to be pretty hungry


947
0:36:39,397 --> 0:36:41,799
to eat one of those
but I would do it.


948
0:36:41,799 --> 0:36:43,568
Ryan Croft: You have
the capability of


949
0:36:43,568 --> 0:36:45,836
taking care of
yourself with only


950
0:36:45,836 --> 0:36:48,839
that which nature
provides in abundance.


951
0:36:48,839 --> 0:36:52,243
Adaptability, flexibility
is the number one


952
0:36:52,243 --> 0:36:55,613
skill that you should
cultivate in yourself.


953
0:36:55,613 --> 0:36:57,448
<i> Narrator: Apart from
 algae and worms,</i>


954
0:36:57,448 --> 0:36:59,717
<i> Ryan doesn't put
 too much emphasis</i>


955
0:36:59,717 --> 0:37:2,253
<i> on stockpiling
 additional food.</i>


956
0:37:2,253 --> 0:37:3,688
Ryan Croft: We have
about 1,200 pounds


957
0:37:3,688 --> 0:37:4,755
of food storage.


958
0:37:4,755 --> 0:37:7,158
On a normal 2,200
calorie per day diet.


959
0:37:7,158 --> 0:37:9,36
I've only got about
3 to 4 months.


960
0:37:9,36 --> 0:37:11,929
But you really don't have
to stock a lot of things.


961
0:37:11,929 --> 0:37:13,464
Especially if you
have got some


962
0:37:13,464 --> 0:37:16,767
experience with primitive
survival techniques.


963
0:37:16,767 --> 0:37:19,17
<i> Narrator: Ryan spent four
 years in the Air Force</i>


964
0:37:19,17 --> 0:37:21,72
<i> and learned how to
 survive off the land</i>


965
0:37:21,72 --> 0:37:22,907
<i> with limited
 resources.</i>


966
0:37:22,907 --> 0:37:24,375
Ryan Croft: I
lived primitively


967
0:37:24,375 --> 0:37:25,943
for years,
intentionally.


968
0:37:25,943 --> 0:37:28,179
No power, no
running water and


969
0:37:28,179 --> 0:37:31,215
I lived for
a long time.


970
0:37:31,215 --> 0:37:32,617
We're going to
scavenge from our


971
0:37:32,617 --> 0:37:34,51
local environment,


972
0:37:34,51 --> 0:37:36,87
to supplement our
food storage.


973
0:37:36,87 --> 0:37:37,989
<i> Narrator: Tonight,
 he's taking his boys</i>


974
0:37:37,989 --> 0:37:40,124

 woods to show them what</i>

0:37:40,124 --> 0:37:43,694
<i> else he expects them to
 do should doomsday come.</i>


976
0:37:43,694 --> 0:37:45,83
Ryan Croft: One of
the lesser and least


977
0:37:45,83 --> 0:37:47,965
appreciated foods
around America


978
0:37:47,965 --> 0:37:50,234
is the common
field mouse;


979
0:37:50,234 --> 0:37:51,369
full of nutrition.


980
0:37:51,369 --> 0:37:52,737
If you eat the
whole thing,


981
0:37:52,737 --> 0:37:53,938
the whole
little mouse,


982
0:37:53,938 --> 0:37:56,474
you're gonna have
a complete diet.


983
0:37:56,474 --> 0:37:57,808
<i> Narrator: Field
 mice are a</i>


984
0:37:57,808 --> 0:37:59,51
<i> constantly
 renewable resource.</i>


985
0:37:59,51 --> 0:38:2,446
<i> Each female can give
 birth to 83 mice</i>


986
0:38:2,446 --> 0:38:4,649
<i> in the course
 of one year.</i>


987
0:38:4,649 --> 0:38:6,584
<i> But at roughly
 70 calories each,</i>


988
0:38:6,584 --> 0:38:8,85
<i> in order to meet
 minimum recommend</i>


989
0:38:8,85 --> 0:38:11,455
<i> calorie requirements on
 a 100% mouse diet,</i>


990
0:38:11,455 --> 0:38:14,458
<i> he'd have to consume
 17 mice each day.</i>


991
0:38:14,458 --> 0:38:16,927
<i> So for Ryan it's
 extremely important that</i>


992
0:38:16,927 --> 0:38:19,263
<i> his boys become
 skilled mouse hunters.</i>


993
0:38:19,263 --> 0:38:21,565
Ryan Croft: We're going to
demonstrate a Paiute trap.


994
0:38:21,565 --> 0:38:23,367
You put a little
twig in here.


995
0:38:23,367 --> 0:38:24,935
See my side, where
my fingers are?


996
0:38:24,935 --> 0:38:26,837
That's where you need
to apply the pressure.


997
0:38:26,837 --> 0:38:29,6
<i> Narrator: Ryan is building
 a simple deadfall trap</i>


998
0:38:29,6 --> 0:38:31,575
<i> out of notched sticks
 and a heavy rock.</i>


999
0:38:31,575 --> 0:38:34,178
<i> By tying the bait to the
 end of the trigger stick,</i>


1000
0:38:34,178 --> 0:38:35,98
<i> if it's disturbed
 it will cause the</i>


1001
0:38:35,98 --> 0:38:38,516
<i> delicately balanced
 sticks to collapse,</i>


1002
0:38:38,516 --> 0:38:41,18
<i> and the deadweight
 will fall.</i>


1003
0:38:41,18 --> 0:38:42,62
Ryan Croft: All he has
to do is sniff on that


1004
0:38:42,62 --> 0:38:43,954
peanut butter a
little bit.


1005
0:38:43,954 --> 0:38:46,457
It does not take
very much pressure.


1006
0:38:46,457 --> 0:38:49,26
A fraction of an ounce
touches that stick


1007
0:38:49,26 --> 0:38:51,329
and we want that little
tiny bit of weight


1008
0:38:51,329 --> 0:38:52,596
to trip this off.


1009
0:38:52,596 --> 0:38:55,433
This is a very dense
habitat for mice.


1010
0:38:55,433 --> 0:38:58,269
So hook 'em up with the
convenience store right here.


1011
0:38:58,269 --> 0:39:5,242
They can check in,
but not check out.


1012
0:39:5,242 --> 0:39:9,78
Alright, well
there you go.


1013
0:39:9,78 --> 0:39:14,952
Common field mouse
and he's dinner.


1014
0:39:14,952 --> 0:39:18,122
All right, guys
I brought dinner.


1015
0:39:18,122 --> 0:39:19,156
Corbin: What
are we havin'?


1016
0:39:19,156 --> 0:39:20,825
Ryan Croft: Little mouse,
little field mouse.


1017
0:39:20,825 --> 0:39:22,126
He didn't
feel a thing.


1018
0:39:22,126 --> 0:39:24,261
There's no good way
to skin a mouse.


1019
0:39:24,261 --> 0:39:26,464
You pretty much just
destroy them if you do.


1020
0:39:26,464 --> 0:39:27,732
We're gonna
hammer him out.


1021
0:39:27,732 --> 0:39:29,133
Break his little
bones up.


1022
0:39:29,133 --> 0:39:31,769
Front to back, from
the head down and


1023
0:39:31,769 --> 0:39:33,838
then we just drop him
right into the coals.


1024
0:39:33,838 --> 0:39:35,172
You roll him around
a little bit.


1025
0:39:35,172 --> 0:39:36,34
Let him get crispy.


1026
0:39:36,34 --> 0:39:37,842
Ben: So what's the
best part to eat?


1027
0:39:37,842 --> 0:39:40,578
Ryan Croft:
His head.


1028
0:39:40,578 --> 0:39:43,414
So boys, who's gonna
try some mouse?


1029
0:39:43,414 --> 0:39:45,583
Corbin: Not me, I had
the worm last time.


1030
0:39:45,583 --> 0:39:46,45
Ryan Croft: Gordy?


1031
0:39:46,45 --> 0:39:47,685
Gordy: I don't
think so.


1032
0:39:47,685 --> 0:39:48,686
Ryan Croft: You
don't think so.


1033
0:39:48,686 --> 0:39:49,787
You might be
hungry someday,


1034
0:39:49,787 --> 0:39:50,921
you might really.


1035
0:39:50,921 --> 0:39:52,39
Gordy: Yeah, I'll do it
when I'm really hungry.


1036
0:39:52,39 --> 0:39:53,29
Ryan Croft:
All right.


1037
0:39:53,29 --> 0:39:54,458
Ben: I'll try it.


1038
0:39:54,458 --> 0:40:4,101
Ryan Croft:
All right.


1039
0:40:4,101 --> 0:40:6,771
Ben: Mmmm.


1040
0:40:6,771 --> 0:40:8,906
Ryan Croft:
Charcoal-y, huh?


1041
0:40:8,906 --> 0:40:10,107
Count of three.


1042
0:40:10,107 --> 0:40:12,76
Gordy: One
two three.


1043
0:40:12,76 --> 0:40:12,81
Alex: Go.


1044
0:40:12,81 --> 0:40:13,844
You got it,
you got it.


1045
0:40:13,844 --> 0:40:14,879
Go 'head,
you got it.


1046
0:40:14,879 --> 0:40:16,8
Go 'head,
crunch it up.


1047
0:40:16,8 --> 0:40:17,81
It's gone, it's
gone, it's gone.


1048
0:40:17,81 --> 0:40:20,651
There you go,
there you go.


1049
0:40:20,651 --> 0:40:22,453
Ryan Croft:
It's delicious.


1050
0:40:22,453 --> 0:40:23,687
Gordy: Ugh!


1051
0:40:23,687 --> 0:40:25,956
Ryan Croft: A few good
tools, plus know-how,


1052
0:40:25,956 --> 0:40:27,691
you can find
mice anywhere.


1053
0:40:27,691 --> 0:40:29,26
You'll never
go hungry.


1054
0:40:29,26 --> 0:40:30,861
<i> Narrator: Scavenging
 enough food to</i>


1055
0:40:30,861 --> 0:40:33,264
<i> survive on in an
 apocalypse is one thing;</i>


1056
0:40:33,264 --> 0:40:34,965
<i> keeping it safe from
 those who would take</i>


1057
0:40:34,965 --> 0:40:37,435
<i> it from you
 is another.</i>


1058
0:40:37,435 --> 0:40:40,37
<i> So Ryan has taken
 extreme measures to prepare</i>


1059
0:40:40,37 --> 0:40:42,306
<i> his community to
 defend themselves</i>


1060
0:40:42,306 --> 0:40:50,614
<i> to the death,
 if necessary.</i>


1061
0:40:50,614 --> 0:40:52,49
<i> Narrator: Ryan Croft and</i>


1062
0:40:52,49 --> 0:40:54,151
<i> his fellow preppers in
 Asheville, North Carolina,</i>


1063
0:40:54,151 --> 0:40:56,52
<i> are preparing for the
 looming economic collapse</i>


1064
0:40:56,52 --> 0:40:59,56
<i> that Ryan feels
 is inevitable.</i>


1065
0:40:59,56 --> 0:41:0,758
Ryan Croft: We're not
prepping for ourselves.


1066
0:41:0,758 --> 0:41:2,159
We're going the
step beyond;


1067
0:41:2,159 --> 0:41:4,128
we're prepping
for our city.


1068
0:41:4,128 --> 0:41:5,83
<i> Narrator: Ryan fears
 his determination to</i>


1069
0:41:5,83 --> 0:41:7,998
<i> stay in the city and
 help his neighbors will</i>


1070
0:41:7,998 --> 0:41:10,668
<i> put him in the path
 of violent looters.</i>


1071
0:41:10,668 --> 0:41:13,103
<i> So Ryan wants every
 prepper in his group to</i>


1072
0:41:13,103 --> 0:41:14,972
<i> be sufficiently armed.</i>


1073
0:41:14,972 --> 0:41:16,607
Ryan Croft: I think we
should all be armed.


1074
0:41:16,607 --> 0:41:17,708
If you're armed,


1075
0:41:17,708 --> 0:41:19,643
it changes the
game completely.


1076
0:41:19,643 --> 0:41:23,514
More arms works better
than less arms.


1077
0:41:23,514 --> 0:41:25,416
<i> Narrator: But Ryan's not
 content with what's on the</i>


1078
0:41:25,416 --> 0:41:28,719
<i> market, so he's looking
 to create a custom weapon</i>


1079
0:41:28,719 --> 0:41:31,255
<i> specifically to suit
 a prepper's needs.</i>


1080
0:41:31,255 --> 0:41:33,824
Ryan Croft: I took
the best of the AK-47


1081
0:41:33,824 --> 0:41:36,56
and combined it with
the logistical system


1082
0:41:36,56 --> 0:41:38,262
of the AR-15.


1083
0:41:38,262 --> 0:41:41,198
<i> Narrator: The AK-47 is
 generally considered</i>


1084
0:41:41,198 --> 0:41:44,902
<i> durable, cheap,
 and easy to use,</i>


1085
0:41:44,902 --> 0:41:49,773
<i> but an inferior
 weapon to the AR-15,</i>


1086
0:41:49,773 --> 0:41:52,209
<i> which is generally
 more expensive.</i>


1087
0:41:52,209 --> 0:41:54,912
<i> Ryan thought if he could
 combine the best aspects</i>


1088
0:41:54,912 --> 0:41:59,25
<i> of each gun, he'd have the
 perfect prepper weapon.</i>


1089
0:41:59,25 --> 0:42:0,885
Ryan Croft: This
is Joshua Mark One.


1090
0:42:0,885 --> 0:42:2,586
I named it after
a general Joshua,


1091
0:42:2,586 --> 0:42:4,221
my favorite
biblical character.


1092
0:42:4,221 --> 0:42:6,9
Ah, the general pretty
much that secured the


1093
0:42:6,9 --> 0:42:7,992
Promised Land for
the Israelites.


1094
0:42:7,992 --> 0:42:10,194
This is my very first
gun that I built.


1095
0:42:10,194 --> 0:42:11,795
It's sort of the
closest thing a man


1096
0:42:11,795 --> 0:42:14,98
can get to having
a child, I think.


1097
0:42:14,98 --> 0:42:15,566
Cause it's just a
little bunch of parts


1098
0:42:15,566 --> 0:42:16,6
and you bring
it together.


1099
0:42:16,6 --> 0:42:17,801
You breathe
life into it


1100
0:42:17,801 --> 0:42:19,403
and it's magical,
you know?


1101
0:42:19,403 --> 0:42:25,609
This weapon is
perfect for, ah,


1102
0:42:25,609 --> 0:42:27,111
I would say for
American prepper,


1103
0:42:27,111 --> 0:42:29,146
but really just
for America.


1104
0:42:29,146 --> 0:42:31,549
Period.


1105
0:42:31,549 --> 0:42:39,69
Alex: Covering!


1106
0:42:39,69 --> 0:42:41,225
Ryan Croft: We're
prepared to do


1107
0:42:41,225 --> 0:42:44,395
everything that's
necessary to survive.


1108
0:42:44,395 --> 0:42:47,464
We choose to try and save
as many lives as we can.


1109
0:42:47,464 --> 0:42:48,799
Frontal!


1110
0:42:48,799 --> 0:42:51,235
Number one advice
I have for America?


1111
0:42:51,235 --> 0:42:52,97
Be flexible.


1112
0:42:52,97 --> 0:42:55,272
Widen your mind,
broaden your


1113
0:42:55,272 --> 0:43:1,645
capabilities adapt
and overcome.


1114
0:43:1,645 --> 0:43:2,947
<i> Narrator: Ryan,
 the experts at</i>


1115
0:43:2,947 --> 0:43:4,582
<i> Practical Preppers
 commend you for</i>


1116
0:43:4,582 --> 0:43:6,817
<i> your community
 action plan.</i>


1117
0:43:6,817 --> 0:43:8,719
<i> By rallying your
 friends and neighbors</i>


1118
0:43:8,719 --> 0:43:10,12
<i> you will establish
 a system that</i>


1119
0:43:10,12 --> 0:43:12,656
<i> mutually benefits
 everyone.</i>


1120
0:43:12,656 --> 0:43:14,525
Ryan Croft:
Thank you.


1121
0:43:14,525 --> 0:43:16,16
<i> Narrator: Your varied
 and non-conventional</i>


1122
0:43:16,16 --> 0:43:19,563
<i> food sources are
 clever and efficient.</i>


1123
0:43:19,563 --> 0:43:20,998
<i> However you may
 have trouble</i>


1124
0:43:20,998 --> 0:43:22,733
<i> feeding your
 family of seven.</i>


1125
0:43:22,733 --> 0:43:24,435
<i> We recommend you look
 into expanding your</i>


1126
0:43:24,435 --> 0:43:29,39
<i> stockpile of traditional
 foods with long shelf life.</i>


1127
0:43:29,39 --> 0:43:31,41
Ryan Croft: Understood,
I don't disagree.


1128
0:43:31,41 --> 0:43:33,277
However, if we
fully develop our


1129
0:43:33,277 --> 0:43:37,848
Spirulina tech, I think
we'll be just fine.


1130
0:43:37,848 --> 0:43:39,35
<i> Narrator: To determine
 how long you could</i>


1131
0:43:39,35 --> 0:43:41,151
<i> initially survive
 a catastrophe,</i>

0:43:41,151 --> 0:43:43,587
<i> Practical Preppers has

1133
0:43:43,587 --> 0:43:47,658
<i> five categories of

1134
0:43:47,658 --> 0:43:50,828
<i> Food: 14 out
 of 20 points.</i>


1135
0:43:50,828 --> 0:43:52,596
<i> Needing to walk half
 a mile to collect</i>


1136
0:43:52,596 --> 0:43:55,432
<i> water is impractical
 and could be dangerous:</i>


1137
0:43:55,432 --> 0:43:57,801
<i> 9 out of 20 points.</i>


1138
0:43:57,801 --> 0:44:1,38
<i> Shelter: 13 out

1139
0:44:1,38 --> 0:44:4,808
<i> Security: 15 out
 of 20 points.</i>


1140
0:44:4,808 --> 0:44:6,81
<i> Your community approach
 to helping neighbors</i>


1141
0:44:6,81 --> 0:44:8,646
<i> and sharing your
 Spirulina gives you</i>


1142
0:44:8,646 --> 0:44:11,115
<i> 12 x-factor points.</i>


1143
0:44:11,115 --> 0:44:14,485
<i> Overall, you get
 a 63 out of 100.</i>


1144
0:44:14,485 --> 0:44:18,589
<i> You have ten months
 initial survival time.</i>


1145
0:44:18,589 --> 0:44:20,724
Ryan Croft: Well my
family have deeply


1146
0:44:20,724 --> 0:44:23,661
appreciated the
assessment.


1147
0:44:23,661 --> 0:44:24,995
You check us out.


1148
0:44:24,995 --> 0:44:27,831
If the world will
give us another year


1149
0:44:27,831 --> 0:44:32,169
I think we'll be doubly,
triply impressive.


1150
0:44:32,169 --> 0:44:34,238
We've made a lot of
really good progress.


1151
0:44:34,238 --> 0:44:35,873
Not in every way
that we want to,


1152
0:44:35,873 --> 0:44:38,8
but in very
significant ways.


1153
0:44:38,8 --> 0:44:40,577
Our Spirulina is
doing quite well.


1154
0:44:40,577 --> 0:44:43,48
It's very thick, it's
ready for harvesting.


1155
0:44:43,48 --> 0:44:46,116
And we've posted a lot
of videos on YouTube


1156
0:44:46,116 --> 0:44:49,353
showing what we've done
and how we've done it,


1157
0:44:49,353 --> 0:44:51,121
so that we can help
more people that


1158
0:44:51,121 --> 0:44:55,325
are also trying
to prepare.


1159
0:44:55,325 --> 0:44:57,327
<i> Narrator: In spite of

1160
0:44:57,327 --> 0:45:0,464
<i> European debt crisis,
