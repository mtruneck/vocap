###1 MALE SPEAKER: All right.
###2 Thank you guys for coming to this screening and Q&A
###5 regarding "Extreme By Design."
###7 It's a new documentary film that premiered early December.
###12 AUDIENCE: Yeah.
###13 December 11.
###13 MALE SPEAKER: December 11, premiered on PBS.
###15 So we're lucky enough today to have
###16 here Ralph King, the director, along with two people that
###20 are with him that are also part of the Stanford D
###22 School, the Stanford Design School.
###24 Which is one of the biggest design thinking evangelists,
###30 I would say.
###31 I feel like you can't hear about design thinking
###32 without hearing about Stamford.
###33 So it's great to have them with us.
###35 I'm going to tell you a little bit about them,
###36 and then we'll go right to the screening.
###38 And then have a Q&A afterwards with an open forum
###40 for everyone.
###41 So "Extreme By Design," at a time
###45 of unprecedented global challenges,
###47 the under 30 millennial generation
###49 has every reason to be disengaged.
###51 Yet plenty of millennials are engaged.
###54 Call it the empathy revolution.
###55 That's a big Stanford thing.
###57 "Extreme by Design," an hour long documentary film,
###59 brings this revolution to life by following three Stanford
###62 University students as they design and build products
###65 to meet basic needs of the world's poor.
###68 And I'll tell you in just a minute,
###70 expand on that, about a program that our two other guests
###74 have designed on PBS Learning Media that's
###77 an extension of this experience and this lesson.
###79 So I'll get to tell you about that in a minute.
###81 And our director, Ralph, is a graduate
###84 of Stanford, an independent filmmaker,
###85 and founder of Hawk View Pictures.
###88 Prior to filmmaking, he spent 25 years
###91 as a reporter for the "Wall Street Journal"
###93 and several national magazines.
###95 And he was twice nominated by "Wall Street Journal" editors
###100 for the Pulitzer Prize and won the National Association
###104 of Science Writer's Science in Society award
###107 and the California Governor's Media award.
###110 Ralph recently became a filmmaker.
###112 And said you you've been working on this one for about
###114 four years?
###115 RALPH KING: Yeah.
###115 Right in the first four years before it all started.
###118 MALE SPEAKER: There you go.
###118 So four years on this one, I think
###120 you would say this is probably your first big one?
###121 RALPH KING: Yeah.
###122 MALE SPEAKER: Right?
###122 So now onto our two other guests.
###125 One is Leticia Cavagnaro.
###129 She comes from the world of science,
###131 where she acquired a couple of degrees.
###133 I like how you said that.
###134 "A couple of degrees," no big deal.
###137 Strong analytical skills, which she balances
###139 with creative thinking, and the ability to learn
###141 from failed experiments.
###143 Venturing outside of the biology lab,
###145 Leticia found that designing learning experiences
###147 was just as challenging and even more rewarding.
###151 Leticia is now adjunct faculty at the School of Engineering's
###155 Stanford Technology Ventures Program
###158 and the deputy director-- there we go,
###164 recently changed-- deputy director of the National Center
###166 for Engineering Pathways to Innovation, known as Epicenter.
###170 And as a co-lecturer on the Creativity and Innovation
###173 course, which here you guys might know as CSI,
###175 she gets to witness the journey of students
###177 as they develop their creative confidence
###179 and go on accomplishing amazing things.
###181 Which you guys will definitely see in this next hour.
###183 And our other guest is Melissa Pelochino.
###188 I love that last name.
###189 That's such a good one.
###190 Fellow at the Stanford D school, her current focus
###193 is on redesigning the professional development
###195 experience for K-12 teachers and administrators.
###199 Which again, you'll see in this PBS Learning Media.
###203 Melissa is a former teacher and administrator
###205 in low-income schools.
###206 And after learning about design thinking in 2007,
###209 she began her mission to integrate the design thinking
###213 process and mindsets into K-12 schools all over the world.
###216 There's some really interesting stories
###218 that follow that as well.
###220 Now to tell you about the PBS Learning Media.
###224 Would you probably call it "Extreme by Design Watch
###226 and Do"?
###227 Did I get that right?
###228 So the idea of this is it's an interactive experience
###231 on PBS Learning Media, which is a resource for teachers.
###235 And it's designed for fourth through 12th grade students
###237 to be completed after watching the "Extreme by Design"
###240 documentary.
###242 For example, the first episode, "Being an Innovator"
###245 helps students think and act like innovators
###247 using the design thinking approach.
###249 Scenes from this documentary are used to illustrate concepts,
###253 and a protagonist acts as a guide who provides instructions
###256 and explanations to the students.
###258 And that's narrated by all three?
###261 Or one of the students that we see in the film?
###263 MELISSA PELOCHINO: One of the students.
###263 MALE SPEAKER: Just one of the students we see in the film.
###265 He narrates this whole learning experience, which teachers then
###267 take to their classroom to expand
###269 on this "Extreme by Design" film.
###271 Which I think is a very cool way of not only learning something,
###273 but then putting it into action.
###275 So we'll go ahead and watch the film now,
###277 and then we'll have a Q&A right afterwards.
###280 AUDIENCE: How do you come up with the universe
###282 of potential solutions?
###283 I didn't see anything on that.
###285 What's the winnowing process that you
###287 go to take that large universe down to a small subset
###291 that you're then going to proceed
###293 to invest the time and effort in.
###297 And how can that be replicable?
###298 Because I think that's something that
###300 would be useful to take from this.
###304 LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO: So I should say,
###306 I do not teach this specific class.
###308 And there's some variability amongst the different D School
###312 classes.
###312 But for sure that the process is not proprietary,
###315 and it's all shared.
###319 Many of the resources that we use for teaching
###322 are shared on the web.
###324 Mostly, in a nutshell, the design thinking process
###328 would start with identifying problems
###331 from the user perspective.
###333 I think that came through in the film.
###339 So for coming up with ideas, there's
###344 many techniques that you can use.
###347 But mostly it's a very simple concept
###350 of going beyond the first right answer.
###352 Right?
###353 And I think that when we teach mostly engineers
###357 or other technical students, we give them
###363 a very, very well-defined problem.
###366 And we teach them to come up with a solution.
###369 We should push them to think of many possible solutions.
###372 So just that simple concept is the start
###375 of getting them to think beyond the first right answer.
###380 Do you want to add?
###381 MELISSA PELOCHINO: I would just add
###383 in terms of criteria for selection, it ranges.
###387 Sometimes criteria for selection is given by the instructors,
###391 and sometimes it's not.
###393 I would say most importantly, it's what's feasible.
###398 If you're having to actually create something
###401 that you can make, either an experience
###402 or a product, and also what meets the need
###406 that you identified earlier on in the process in the best way.
###410 And so students do brainstorm.
###411 There were some short clips in the movie.
###415 They said "trainstorming" as sort of a play
###417 on brainstorming.
###418 And some other short parts where they were throwing
###421 Post-its up with a whole bunch of different ideas.
###424 But as Leticia said, there's a lot
###426 of different strategies for getting
###428 outside the box of what's possible,
###430 and to really weld ideas.
###431 And then criteria for narrowing that down and selecting it.
###434 And there's several.
###436 RALPH KING: I guess I would just add to that, defining
###438 the problem, as I guess we all know
###440 is much more important than finding the solution.
###443 So the Indonesian group that was on this quixotic adventure
###448 that they didn't realize they were
###450 looking for the wrong thing, initially.
###453 The partner in those countries, NGOs,
###456 will give you an assignment.
###458 But often you end up way over here
###461 in the process of figuring out something you can solve,
###464 or something that's the right size for a six month course,
###468 or the little blue sleeping bag, the embrace.
###472 Their initial assignment was to come up
###474 with a cheaper, in-hospital incubator.
###476 And within a matter of days, when they were out
###479 in the field, they realized that 95% of the babies
###481 are born out in the rural villages and no electricity.
###484 So they basically walked away from that partner
###487 and came up with that design.
###489 So problem definition, I think, is also
###493 a long and important process.
###494 
###499 AUDIENCE: Hi.
###499 Thanks again.
###500 I was curious about, it occurred to me
###504 that the local people in Indonesia or wherever
###508 would be motivated to help solve these problems.
###511 And maybe they had no time or resources,
###514 but there must be bright people there, too.
###517 Is there effort to, I don't know,
###519 transition some of the solutions that way?
###521 Instead of, say, to Walmart or wherever, and help
###526 continue the projects?
###527 RALPH KING: Yeah.
###528 I mean there's no-- this movie is set up
###530 as a West to East kind of solution--
###532 but there's no reason why it shouldn't be the other way.
###536 Or West to West and East to East kind of thing.
###538 That the problem solvers should ideally
###543 come from the culture in which they live.
###547 Stanford, for one, has an organization
###550 called The Seed Institute.
###552 They got a big gift from a local couple that is now setting up
###556 D School like innovation labs in places like Ghana and Myanmar
###560 and I think eight other countries,
###562 they plan to create for local entrepreneurs
###565 to learn the methodologies and to incubate their companies.
###570 And then sometimes the partners in these countries
###575 will come back to Stanford and bring their staffs with them.
###579 Like the group, you saw the red treadle pump there in Myanmar?
###582 Well that organization, Proximity Design,
###584 sent a big group back with our teams
###587 to study the school and the process.
###590 And then have now carried that back there.
###593 So there's an objection raised that this
###597 seems a little neo-colonial and just
###601 another version of charity.
###604 But there's no reason why it can't
###608 be something that operates locally.
###610 In fact, one of the projects was, if you saw on the map,
###615 set in Arizona, an Apache reservation.
###618 So within American culture, obviously, there's
###622 lots of room for these kinds of projects.
###624 And they happen here.
###626 But this particular class tends to go overseas
###629 because of the way it's set up.
###631 MELISSA PELOCHINO: And in fact this film
###633 is serving as inspiration for exactly that to happen.
###637 We're working with a school in India of fourth and fifth grade
###641 students who saw the film.
###643 And Ralph was there through Skype to answer some Q&A.
###647 And then Leticia and I are going to be leading them
###649 through their own design challenge
###651 later next week, actually.
###653 So the film is serving as inspiration
###655 to empower people, children all over the world
###658 to solve their own problems.
###659 
###663 AUDIENCE: So, Ralph, how did you decide how to tell this story?
###665 Did you just follow your three groups around with a camera,
###668 or did you look at some other groups,
###671 and already have an outline of what you were looking for?
###674 RALPH KING: The question is why I
###675 decided to do this particular story.
###678 I was working at the Stanford Business School
###683 when I heard about this class.
###685 And I spent a year auditing the course, or a six month cycle.
###690 And so I, as part of that, went out
###694 with one of the student teams, I mentioned earlier, to Myanmar.
###697 And filmmakers and journalists weren't welcome in Myanmar
###701 at that time, so I was a "student."
###703 And it was day four of the trip, and I
###706 was feeling very discouraged because I
###708 hadn't had any startling observations
###710 to contribute to my team.
###712 And so I was kind of shuffling through the town.
###717 And I noticed a family sitting in a pagoda in a meditation
###722 room.
###723 They had come in for the bizarre, the county fair, that
###727 was happening in the town, and were about to leave.
###729 I sat down and asked if I could interview them.
###731 They said sure.
###732 I started firing all my journalistic questions at them
###736 and madly scribbling my notebook.
###739 About 15 minutes into this interview, I looked up.
###743 And there, in addition to the six people,
###747 35 other people had just glided in silently and sat down.
###752 And were watching this whole thing
###755 going on with this crazy westerner.
###758 And in that moment, I just put my book down.
###760 And I leaned back.
###761 And I just was filled with ecstasy.
###765 I've really felt for the first time
###767 in 25 years as a journalist that I understood
###770 the difference between gathering facts and observing
###772 with an open heart.
###773 And this sudden appearance of people
###779 totally unbeknownst to me was like, for me,
###781 this kind of trumpets blaring from the heavens,
###788 how much experience I tend to exclude.
###792 It just was like discovering a new capacity in myself.
###796 And so for the next two days, I was like walking on air.
###801 And I thought, well, if even auditing this class is having
###806 this kind of effect on me, imagine
###808 what it's doing for these 20 somethings who
###810 have skin in the game and actually have
###812 to produce something for people that they meet.
###815 So I felt like there was a powerful element to it.
###819 And it was kind of like Pam said, where the boundaries just
###824 collapse.
###824 And in that moment, she felt like she just had to do this.
###828 Well that's kind of the way I felt about this story.
###830 And so I guess that's why I did it.
###837 
###840 And I guess I would also like to say that now that the film is
###846 made, it's become something else.
###848 And that's partly why Melissa and Leticia are here today.
###852 Because there is a kind of movement in education
###856 now to bring design thinking and these methods
###860 more into the mainstream, more into young people's
###864 lives, in schools, and also into companies.
###868 I know here at Google, it's a fairly common
###872 or fairly well-known thing.
###874 But in other parts of the country, less so.
###878 But we see little beginnings.
###879 So after making the film, I came to my friends and said,
###886 how do we get this in front of young people?
###888 Young people don't watch PBS.
###890 Which is where it broadcasted.
###893 So we start talking about a workshop.
###894 And how could we incorporate the film in a workshop?
###897 And so we did little clips.
###898 And we had this 90 minute workshop.
###900 And that was great.
###901 But we did it in some schools, but how do we scale it?
###906 So then PBS offered us an opportunity
###909 to put on their teacher portal something online.
###912 And so Melissa and Leticia, God bless them, took the film
###917 and created this wonderful hour-long exercise,
###923 like a press play exercise, that takes
###927 young people in a classroom through the basic elements,
###931 the steps, of design thinking.
###933 So it gives them a flavor and a taste of what it's like.
###936 And so what keeps me up at night now
###941 is figuring out ways like this to scale design thinking
###945 education.
###947 We're at a moment in our education system
###951 where the common core is coming in,
###952 which is much more process oriented rather than content
###956 oriented.
###957 So it's kind of an inflection point that is timely.
###962 And I actually would welcome any ideas that you have,
###969 if you've experienced the scaling
###973 of a new kind of concept here at Google.
###976 And how that's done.
###977 I'm really looking and searching for answers to that right now.
###983 AUDIENCE: I would love to know about the challenges
###985 that you guys had trying to get something like the CSI process
###990 onto this online workshop for students.
###992 Because here it's a few hours of hands-on, in the classroom,
###997 stuff that we do.
###998 So how did you guys get that into scale
###1000 and what were the challenges?
###1003 LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO: So I should
###1004 say that before attempting to do this module for k-12,
###1010 I had approached Ralph, having seen the movie.
###1014 And I did a massive online course on design thinking.
###1017 And I selected some of the clips to illustrate
###1021 some of the challenges.
###1023 So I do believe that you can translate
###1027 this type of experiential learning
###1029 into an online experience.
###1031 You just have to not be literal.
###1033 Right?
###1033 So when we think about an online resource, we think, OK.
###1037 There's going to be a video of a lecture, and then a quiz
###1043 that basically quizzes you on whether you were
###1046 paying attention to the lecture.
###1048 Right?
###1048 But the way I defined that course
###1052 was completely different.
###1053 I thought, how can I design something
###1056 that is very personal for each learner?
###1059 And use the metaphor of kind of like a "Choose
###1063 Your Own Adventure" book.
###1064 Right?
###1065 So you would, according to what you were seeing
###1068 and what you were answering, and like no right answer quizzes.
###1073 You would be pointed to different parts
###1076 of the materials that were meaningful to you.
###1079 Right?
###1079 So when we approach doing this module, one of the challenges,
###1086 I would say, is that you want to present the learner
###1091 with a meaningful challenge.
###1093 But it's something that they can see the human aspect of it.
###1098 So one of the things that we struggled really with
###1101 was defining the right to challenge to give the students.
###1106 And not something that was directly coming from the movie,
###1109 so they already saw what the student's solution had been.
###1113 And they would gravitate towards doing something similar.
###1117 Right?
###1118 So we took a challenge of one of the teams that was not
###1122 portrayed in the movie, was just mentioned at the beginning,
###1126 as one of the main challenges.
###1128 Do you want to?
###1129 MELISSA PELOCHINO: Yeah.
###1129 I would say that was definitely a challenge.
###1132 Another challenge we had is sort of providing
###1135 an experiential learning opportunity for students.
###1139 Being mindful that teachers need to manage their class
###1142 and that this may not be the type of learning and teaching
###1146 that a teacher might feel comfortable with.
###1149 So trying to find the right balance between the giving
###1153 or delivering of material and content,
###1155 and the experience that the students
###1157 would be having, I think was definitely challenging.
###1162 We're in a time right now where teachers
###1165 were taught in a way that's very different than we're now
###1168 asking them to teach.
###1170 And so being mindful of that gap and sort of finding
###1173 the right balance there was very challenging.
###1175 And how we sort of answered that for ourselves was providing
###1180 a lot of scaffolding for the students.
###1184 So, for example, we ask them to identify a bunch of needs
###1188 that a particular "character" that we present might have.
###1193 But then we present an actual need
###1197 that we want the whole group to solve for all together.
###1200 So we gave them the freedom to sort of generate
###1202 their own ideas.
###1204 But then we kept it sort of whole class
###1207 as they move through the process.
###1209 Which enabled the teacher, we felt,
###1211 to manage a little bit easier.
###1214 LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO: In a way,
###1215 the resource needs to be a learning
###1219 experience for the students, but also for the teacher.
###1222 Right?
###1222 Because we wanted if this is going to scale,
###1226 this is going into the hands of a teacher who is not
###1230 knowledgeable about the same thinking.
###1232 So they might not be comfortable with being the facilitator.
###1236 So what we did was we took one of this students,
###1240 Darrell, that appears in the movie,
###1242 is one of the water storage team students.
###1247 And he was the facilitator.
###1249 So this particular module, or one instance of the module,
###1253 was, just as Ralph said, just like press play and go.
###1257 So you would have the teacher on the screen saying,
###1260 and now we're going to do this.
###1262 And the teacher would be kind of like the facilitator
###1264 on the side, providing the materials.
###1266 And in a way, giving the teacher the opportunity to
###1270 observe the students in action.
###1271 And seeing the interaction with this in-screen facilitator.
###1275 Right?
###1276 And this is an experiment.
###1277 We really don't know, and we're eager to find out,
###1282 how this works in schools.
###1284 And hopefully we'll be able to go into some classrooms
###1288 and see how it works.
###1291 RALPH KING: Leticia is modest.
###1292 Her MOOC that she created at Stanford
###1295 attracted thousands and thousands
###1298 of students who actually completed it,
###1301 which also with MOOC is not that common.
###1304 And had some really amazing feedback
###1307 and experiences from it.
###1310 And so the scaling of design thinking
###1316 is happening in a number of ways.
###1318 And these folks are among the pioneers of it.
###1325 AUDIENCE: So in the movie, in the class,
###1328 I didn't see many design students
###1333 with the design backgrounds.
###1334 So I saw the professors who are from technology backgrounds
###1339 or from psychology background, so I wonder how much effort
###1343 made by design professors or students
###1348 with the design background?
###1349 And how many people have design backgrounds
###1353 get involved into this process?
###1356 
###1358 RALPH KING: Usually in that course, there are a quarter,
###1364 or maybe not quite that many, of the students
###1366 are from the design.
###1367 There's a design program, a joint program in design,
###1371 at the graduate level at Stanford.
###1374 But it's part of the Mechanical Engineering Department,
###1378 I think.
###1379 So there's a lot of dialogue between the design department
###1383 and the D School, which is not a department itself.
###1388 It's just where people come together to intermingle.
###1391 And so I'd say anywhere from 10 to 25% of the students
###1396 had a design or were currently in a design program.
###1399 But they had, all around them, these instructors
###1403 who were very immersed in the design process.
###1407 But as we said at the very beginning,
###1409 very few had ever made anything in their lives.
###1414 Or designed anything.
###1415 So I think the idea is creating this attitude,
###1421 that if I see a problem in the world, I can fix it.
###1423 Kind of forget the whole idea of design.
###1426 It's a kind of optimism.
###1429 And I can figure out how to find out,
###1432 how to get the answer to this problem,
###1435 if I care enough about it.
###1437 LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO: I would say that students
###1439 with a design background, for the purpose of the D School
###1443 are just one more discipline that
###1445 contributes to a multidisciplinary team.
###1448 But we really think design thinking
###1450 is a much broader language for creating a problem definition
###1456 and solving.
###1457 And we are all designers in a way, right?
###1460 And getting that attitude, as Ralph
###1463 said, into every discipline.
###1467 AUDIENCE: I would totally agree, design thinking and design are
###1471 basically different things.
###1472 But I wonder, for the students in this class,
###1475 this Extreme class, did they get any design skill training?
###1480 Because during the whole process,
###1482 they need to do the research, do the interviews,
###1487 so there are a lot of design skills or research
###1489 skills involved in the process.
###1491 So I wonder, except the design thinking,
###1493 did they get any other training or specific skills?
###1498 MELISSA PELOCHINO: Each class has its own sort
###1500 of ways that they convey the design thinking
###1504 process and methodology.
###1507 So I can't-- I mean, you could probably speak better than us
###1511 because we don't teach that particular class--
###1514 but I can say in the class that we're teaching right now
###1517 at the D School, we do teach the skills required for the design
###1523 thinking process alongside the mindsets and sort of attitudes
###1527 as well.
###1528 In a way that's very experiential.
###1530 And then they go out into the field and they apply them.
###1533 So there definitely is training along the way,
###1536 throughout any design thinking course.
###1539 And I would also add that the D School is not actually
###1543 a school.
###1544 By design, it doesn't issue degrees on purpose.
###1547 They didn't want to have a space that like the creatives
###1551 are over here and everybody else is over here.
###1553 It's specifically a place where people
###1555 from all different disciplines and backgrounds come together.
###1559 And sort of one of the cornerstones of design thinking
###1562 is that interdisciplinary cross-breeding
###1566 of ideas and perspectives.
###1568 That that's what yields the most creative and innovative
###1570 results.
###1571 LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO: And I would, building on
###1573 that, it's a place where people come
###1575 for different amounts of time and involvement.
###1579 Right?
###1579 So it's not like you have a set amount of classes
###1584 that you have to complete to be a D School graduate.
###1587 You do not get that.
###1588 But students can come and take a class and get a sense of that.
###1594 And then go back to their disciplines
###1597 and apply some of that.
###1599 Or they can become kind of like D School junkies, I would say,
###1604 and come and take eight, nine classes, to the point
###1608 that that becomes like a really great part of what they do.
###1612 And what they will do in the future.
###1614 RALPH KING: And these two, together with Frederick,
###1616 are teaching a class in creativity right now.
###1619 And for 40 spots, you had, what, 150 applicants?
###1622 LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO: About 100.
###1624 We had to actually teach the class twice this year,
###1627 because last year, we had 200 applicants for 40 spots.
###1632 So that's why we are now teaching it twice.
###1635 RALPH KING: So the demand is just far
###1637 outstripping the supply of this sort of thing, right now.
###1640 LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO: And it's
###1641 a class that actually is not required.
###1644 And in some cases, it competes with their requirements.
###1648 So some students are trying to struggling, like,
###1651 oh, I want to take this class.
###1653 But I have to take units for my degree.
###1656 And so what do I do?
###1657 Right?
###1657 So it's a great testament of this revolution of the students
###1662 feel this need to acquire these sets of skills and mindsets
###1668 to be creative problem solvers.
###1670 And we're trying to find more ways
###1673 to spread that across Stanford in different ways.
###1678 Not just with the standalone classes, but
###1680 how can we embed that in every class
###1684 in the fabric of Stanford?
###1686 AUDIENCE: So over the weekend, I had the fortune
###1689 of being at D School, attending the Bootleg Boot camp.
###1693 And I wanted to totally appreciate
###1694 the school, and the great material.
###1697 And not just the material, but the peer leaders.
###1702 I really learned a lot.
###1703 And I totally appreciate that.
###1706 And just like Ralph said, I felt like I was walking on air.
###1709 There was just so much energy, so much creativity.
###1711 So thanks.
###1712 And keep up the great work.
###1713 LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO: Thank you for coming.
###1715 And you probably met one of our course assistants
###1717 was one of the D leaders, Ben Baldwin.
###1720 These are students who are now learning
###1722 to teach design thinking.
###1724 So we call an open call for people to come to D School
###1729 and go through a basic training.
###1732 And the students are teaching.
###1735 So thank you.
###1736 MALE SPEAKER: I think that was actually the perfect way
###1738 to finish.
###1739 So thank you guys so much.
###1740 We really appreciate you coming out.
###1743
