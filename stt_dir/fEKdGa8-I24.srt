0:0:1,48 --> 0:0:32,42
[mellow music plays]


2
0:0:32,42 --> 0:0:34,12
So let's say we were
doing geoengineering


3
0:0:34,12 --> 0:0:35,87
because we wanted to make
the weather


4
0:0:35,87 --> 0:0:37,33
a little bit better.


5
0:0:37,33 --> 0:0:39,48
There'll be monsoon failures
during that period.


6
0:0:39,48 --> 0:0:41,48
There'll be huge hurricanes.


7
0:0:41,48 --> 0:0:43,27
The global studies indicate
there will be


8
0:0:43,27 --> 0:0:45,36
some impact
on precipitation patterns.


9
0:0:45,36 --> 0:0:48,39
Might involve large-scale
regional agricultural disruption


10
0:0:48,39 --> 0:0:50,33
lasting a number of years.


11
0:0:50,33 --> 0:0:53,81
Potentially two billion people
could have their food disrupted


12
0:0:53,81 --> 0:0:55,54
by such interventions.


13
0:0:55,54 --> 0:0:57,48
That the aerosols can--
at least in these models,


14
0:0:57,48 --> 0:1:0,24
simulations, or indicated
by these simulations--


15
0:1:0,24 --> 0:1:2,81
can offset most climate change
in most places most of the time


16
0:1:2,81 --> 0:1:5,48
for both precipitation
and runoff.


17
0:1:5,48 --> 0:1:23,6
But it's likely to cause some
damage in some places.


18
0:1:23,6 --> 0:1:36,75
[theme music playing]


19
0:1:36,75 --> 0:1:40,12
When I grow up, I wanna be
either an artist or a teacher.


20
0:1:40,12 --> 0:1:42,75
I wanna grow up in a world where
there's lots of nature.


21
0:1:42,75 --> 0:1:44,45
I love nature.


22
0:1:44,45 --> 0:1:55,6
How can I look my children
in the eyes...


23
0:1:55,6 --> 0:1:58,78
and not try to shed the light
on this issue,


24
0:1:58,78 --> 0:2:2,6
knowing every breath they take
is--is laden with these metals?


25
0:2:2,6 --> 0:2:6,3
I have been forced to conclude
that there is no greater


26
0:2:6,3 --> 0:2:8,24
or no more immediate threat
to anything


27
0:2:8,24 --> 0:2:9,27
that lives and breathes


28
0:2:9,27 --> 0:2:12,24
than the global
geoengineering programs,


29
0:2:12,24 --> 0:2:15,21
short of nuclear catastrophe.


30
0:2:15,21 --> 0:2:18,21
Geoengineering is defined
as the artificial modification


31
0:2:18,21 --> 0:2:19,57
of the earth's climate.


32
0:2:19,57 --> 0:2:22,39
Geoengineers are proposing
spraying 10 to 20 million tons


33
0:2:22,39 --> 0:2:26,39
of toxic aluminum and other
substances into our sky


34
0:2:26,39 --> 0:2:28,63
for the stated goal
of cooling our planet.


35
0:2:28,63 --> 0:2:32,0
So let me distinguish
these two different, uh, kinds


36
0:2:32,0 --> 0:2:34,15
of geoengineering
as clearly as I can.


37
0:2:34,15 --> 0:2:37,87
So the first one is--we call
solar radiation management,


38
0:2:37,87 --> 0:2:40,63
and that's the idea that
you could put reflective,


39
0:2:40,63 --> 0:2:42,42
mostly reflective particles
or other means


40
0:2:42,42 --> 0:2:43,75
to make the earth whiter,


41
0:2:43,75 --> 0:2:46,3
effectively to increase
the earth's reflectivity,


42
0:2:46,3 --> 0:2:49,57
reducing the amount of--of heat
that's absorbed by the sun


43
0:2:49,57 --> 0:2:51,15
and therefore exerting some
overall cooling tendency


44
0:2:51,15 --> 0:2:52,54
on the earth.


45
0:2:52,54 --> 0:2:57,27
I think, though, the initial
results of climate models


46
0:2:57,27 --> 0:2:59,45
indicate that reflection
of sunlight away from the earth


47
0:2:59,45 --> 0:3:3,63
can offset most climate change
in most places most of the time.


48
0:3:3,63 --> 0:3:7,63
But it will damage some places.


49
0:3:7,63 --> 0:3:9,27
We've mostly thought
about sulfur.


50
0:3:9,27 --> 0:3:10,45
Nevertheless, there might be
some good reasons


51
0:3:10,45 --> 0:3:11,75
to think about aluminum.


52
0:3:11,75 --> 0:3:13,0
Turns out, first of all,
there's been a lot of work


53
0:3:13,0 --> 0:3:14,24
on the environmental
consequences of aluminum


54
0:3:14,24 --> 0:3:15,57
in the stratosphere.


55
0:3:15,57 --> 0:3:17,42
There's a bunch of papers going
back to the '70s


56
0:3:17,42 --> 0:3:19,51
that look at the radiative
and ozone--


57
0:3:19,51 --> 0:3:21,81
ozone destroying properties
of aluminum in the stratosphere,


58
0:3:21,81 --> 0:3:23,66
and those make you think it
might be useful.


59
0:3:23,66 --> 0:3:25,81
Do this in just a jet
in a very simple way.


60
0:3:25,81 --> 0:3:28,6
Make high-quality aluminum
particles just by spraying


61
0:3:28,6 --> 0:3:29,72
aluminum vapor out,
which oxidizes.


62
0:3:29,72 --> 0:3:31,39
So it's certainly, in principle,
possible to do that.


63
0:3:31,39 --> 0:3:33,54
Since we released "What
in the World Are They Spraying,"


64
0:3:33,54 --> 0:3:35,51
hundreds of people
from around the world


65
0:3:35,51 --> 0:3:38,9
have began taking rain tests.


66
0:3:38,9 --> 0:3:40,33
What they're finding
is what many are calling


67
0:3:40,33 --> 0:3:42,57
the chemtrail
geoengineering footprint


68
0:3:42,57 --> 0:3:49,18
of aluminum, barium,
and strontium.


69
0:3:49,18 --> 0:3:53,18
So we're finding this Welsbach
footprint internationally,


70
0:3:53,18 --> 0:3:55,54
all over the world,
wherever they take samples


71
0:3:55,54 --> 0:3:59,75
and get a, uh, chemical analysis
of rain and snow water.


72
0:3:59,75 --> 0:4:9,75
This is quite common.


73
0:4:9,75 --> 0:4:13,39
Wherever you see the jet
chemtrails go over,


74
0:4:13,39 --> 0:4:16,6
you're gonna get aluminum,
barium, strontium


75
0:4:16,6 --> 0:4:17,36
coming down on you.


76
0:4:17,36 --> 0:4:19,75
Why would we not believe
that it's happening


77
0:4:19,75 --> 0:4:23,54
when what we see in the sky
matches exactly the express goal


78
0:4:23,54 --> 0:4:27,6
of numerous geoengineering
patents, about 160 or more?


79
0:4:27,6 --> 0:4:29,75
Why would we not believe this
is happening when every element


80
0:4:29,75 --> 0:4:33,3
showing up in the rain tests
are the primary elements named


81
0:4:33,3 --> 0:4:34,57
in those
geoengineering patents?


82
0:4:34,57 --> 0:4:37,33
Why would we not believe this
is happening when we have


83
0:4:37,33 --> 0:4:40,51
escalating levels in very short
time frames, as much--


84
0:4:40,51 --> 0:4:43,18
as short as five years,
we see rain levels


85
0:4:43,18 --> 0:4:46,48
of aluminum, for example,
escalating as much as 50,000%?


86
0:4:46,48 --> 0:4:49,15
California air quality studies
do not show these metals


87
0:4:49,15 --> 0:4:52,51
migrating from China,
and it's of recent origin.


88
0:4:52,51 --> 0:4:54,51
So, you know, this bombardment
of heavy metals


89
0:4:54,51 --> 0:4:57,39
that's raining down on us is
coming from somewhere.


90
0:4:57,39 --> 0:5:0,42
Why would we not believe
geoengineering is occurring


91
0:5:0,42 --> 0:5:3,39
when the weather patterns are so
altered here


92
0:5:3,39 --> 0:5:6,3
in exactly the manner stated
by geoengineers


93
0:5:6,3 --> 0:5:8,36
and reports on the consequences
for geoengineering,


94
0:5:8,36 --> 0:5:9,57
which are diminished rainfall,


95
0:5:9,57 --> 0:5:12,24
which are increased ozone
destruction.


96
0:5:12,24 --> 0:5:14,84
We have a massive ozone hole
in the Northern hemisphere now.


97
0:5:14,84 --> 0:5:17,39
Should aluminum be in the soil
and the rain?


98
0:5:17,39 --> 0:5:19,48
And yes, it should be
in the soil.


99
0:5:19,48 --> 0:5:21,18
It's naturally there.


100
0:5:21,18 --> 0:5:22,24
Always was there.


101
0:5:22,24 --> 0:5:24,0
And should it be in the rain?


102
0:5:24,0 --> 0:5:26,54
Well, absolutely not.


103
0:5:26,54 --> 0:5:31,75
But the standard reply has been,
"Your samples are contaminated."


104
0:5:31,75 --> 0:5:35,81
But since we are getting samples
now that show zero aluminum,


105
0:5:35,81 --> 0:5:37,42
and we're getting lots
of barium and strontium


106
0:5:37,42 --> 0:5:38,84
and zero aluminum.


107
0:5:38,84 --> 0:5:43,12
So that just proves that if
there was dirt in our samples


108
0:5:43,12 --> 0:5:46,75
of some sort,
dust blown up from the ground,


109
0:5:46,75 --> 0:5:53,18
we should get some aluminum
in some detectable quantity.


110
0:5:53,18 --> 0:5:56,78
The primary ingredients in
geoengineering are specifically


111
0:5:56,78 --> 0:6:8,21
the oxides of metals,
including aluminum oxide.


112
0:6:8,21 --> 0:6:11,36
This is devastating plants,
totally devastating.


113
0:6:11,36 --> 0:6:14,27
The trees are dying.
Why?


114
0:6:14,27 --> 0:6:16,57
Approximately two years ago,
I rode in the back--


115
0:6:16,57 --> 0:6:19,3
and you can ride in the back
of my place for miles.


116
0:6:19,3 --> 0:6:22,15
You can go all the way
through the woods, you know,


117
0:6:22,15 --> 0:6:25,66
creeks and everything,
and it was--I say was--gorgeous.


118
0:6:25,66 --> 0:6:29,6
And the day before yesterday,
I took a ride,


119
0:6:29,6 --> 0:6:31,45
and I rode in the back,
and what I found


120
0:6:31,45 --> 0:6:34,3
was total devastation.


121
0:6:34,3 --> 0:6:37,27
As I pointed out before,
Michael, we're seeing,


122
0:6:37,27 --> 0:6:40,6
as in this example here,
very hardy, native plants


123
0:6:40,6 --> 0:6:42,21
completely flash out dead.


124
0:6:42,21 --> 0:6:44,66
That looks like it's been hit
with some kind of a chemical.


125
0:6:44,66 --> 0:6:47,6
And we've only seen this
in the last couple years.


126
0:6:47,6 --> 0:6:50,12
And there's another one there,
there, back over there.


127
0:6:50,12 --> 0:6:52,18
We're seeing mature
madrone trees,


128
0:6:52,18 --> 0:6:56,0
which are 70, 80 feet high,
flash out dead just like this.


129
0:6:56,0 --> 0:6:58,21
USDA refuses
to investigate it.


130
0:6:58,21 --> 0:7:1,72
The pH typically around here
should be about 5.6.


131
0:7:1,72 --> 0:7:4,24
Well, since the contrailing
got heavy,


132
0:7:4,24 --> 0:7:7,24
I watched the pH here
in these forests, well,


133
0:7:7,24 --> 0:7:9,24
go up I guess would be
the word.


134
0:7:9,24 --> 0:7:13,72
from 5.6, it went about 20 times
more alkaline.


135
0:7:13,72 --> 0:7:17,3
Very big red flag of fallout
from these materials


136
0:7:17,3 --> 0:7:19,18
are pH changes
to the forest floor.


137
0:7:19,18 --> 0:7:22,21
We have very extensive studies


138
0:7:22,21 --> 0:7:24,0
from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture


139
0:7:24,0 --> 0:7:25,69
on the soils in our region,


140
0:7:25,69 --> 0:7:28,54
and those soils have changed
in five to six years.


141
0:7:28,54 --> 0:7:32,9
The pH's have changed in this--
in this area


142
0:7:32,9 --> 0:7:35,42
as much as 10 to 12 times toward
alkaline in five to six years.


143
0:7:35,42 --> 0:7:37,51
I've personally been
in the forest testing


144
0:7:37,51 --> 0:7:41,42
with USDA soil scientists
who just scratched their heads


145
0:7:41,42 --> 0:7:43,33
and seemed to have no
explanation


146
0:7:43,33 --> 0:7:46,51
for incredibly profound
changes in pH,


147
0:7:46,51 --> 0:7:49,15
which is affecting the
ecosystem here tremendously.


148
0:7:49,15 --> 0:7:52,6
Aluminum buffer action,
aluminum hydroxide


149
0:7:52,6 --> 0:7:53,63
is what we think it is,


150
0:7:53,63 --> 0:7:59,0
uh, plus the barium carbonate,
strontium titanate,


151
0:7:59,0 --> 0:8:2,36
strontium oxides,
barium oxides,


152
0:8:2,36 --> 0:8:4,63
probably some aluminum oxides
in there.


153
0:8:4,63 --> 0:8:10,15
But this has apparently driven
our acid soils


154
0:8:10,15 --> 0:8:13,6
about 20 times more alkaline,
to about 6.8.


155
0:8:13,6 --> 0:8:16,6
There are simply too many dots
here that connect.


156
0:8:16,6 --> 0:8:18,54
Our skies are almost
never blue anymore.


157
0:8:18,54 --> 0:8:20,69
That is a named consequence
of geoengineering.


158
0:8:20,69 --> 0:8:24,45
The amount of lost sunshine
hitting the planet right now


159
0:8:24,45 --> 0:8:26,3
is beyond belief.


160
0:8:26,3 --> 0:8:27,69
If people look up the term
"global dimming," they will see


161
0:8:27,69 --> 0:8:30,33
that fully 20% of the sun's rays
that reached the planet


162
0:8:30,33 --> 0:8:33,33
several decades ago are
no longer reaching the planet.


163
0:8:33,33 --> 0:8:35,72
I mean, that's a profound change
that few people even know


164
0:8:35,72 --> 0:8:37,9
is occurring.


165
0:8:37,9 --> 0:8:40,39
And you have very visible
occurrences in the sky


166
0:8:40,39 --> 0:8:43,81
from the aircraft,
a very visible sun blocking,


167
0:8:43,81 --> 0:8:47,9
expanding, dingy trails
that are exactly


168
0:8:47,9 --> 0:8:48,75
what geoengineering patents
describe.


169
0:8:48,75 --> 0:8:53,15
Heavy aluminum--I'm talking,
like, in the 40s and 50s,


170
0:8:53,15 --> 0:8:56,78
up to 3,000, 4,000, 5,000--
that's still common.


171
0:8:56,78 --> 0:9:2,0
Uh, barium, strontium,
to, um, oh,


172
0:9:2,0 --> 0:9:5,63
somewhere 40 or 50 to,
again,


173
0:9:5,63 --> 0:9:7,72
about 2,000 or 3,000.


174
0:9:7,72 --> 0:9:10,36
Same for both barium
and strontium.


175
0:9:10,36 --> 0:9:12,21
Where is this mountain
of metal coming from?


176
0:9:12,21 --> 0:9:15,18
Why is asthma, A.D.D.,
Alzheimer's, autism--


177
0:9:15,18 --> 0:9:19,24
all elements related
in many studies to aluminum


178
0:9:19,24 --> 0:9:21,6
or particulate inhalation--


179
0:9:21,6 --> 0:9:22,42
why are these el--
why are these ailments


180
0:9:22,42 --> 0:9:26,9
going off the charts with no
apparent explanation?


181
0:9:26,9 --> 0:9:29,18
Why has respiratory mortality
in the continental United States


182
0:9:29,18 --> 0:9:32,3
gone from eighth on the list
to third in six years?


183
0:9:32,3 --> 0:9:33,51
And no one seems to ask
any questions,


184
0:9:33,51 --> 0:9:37,54
why everybody, uh, every other
person has asthma now,


185
0:9:37,54 --> 0:9:41,36
why every other commercial on TV
is an allergy medication.


186
0:9:41,36 --> 0:9:43,66
And again, when David Keith,


187
0:9:43,66 --> 0:9:45,36
the world's most recognized
geoengineer,


188
0:9:45,36 --> 0:9:48,33
was asked on the record,
had there been any studies done


189
0:9:48,33 --> 0:9:50,63
as to the consequences
of dumping 20 million tons


190
0:9:50,63 --> 0:9:51,75
of aluminum into the atmosphere,


191
0:9:51,75 --> 0:9:53,75
his answer was patently, "No."


192
0:9:53,75 --> 0:9:55,6
While geoengineers claim that
their models


193
0:9:55,6 --> 0:9:59,69
are to cool the planet, a number
of studies now are arising


194
0:9:59,69 --> 0:10:1,84
that indicate,
yes, temporarily,


195
0:10:1,84 --> 0:10:5,21
there will be, regionally,
cooling as these particulates


196
0:10:5,21 --> 0:10:6,45
reflect the sun.


197
0:10:6,45 --> 0:10:9,42
However, they actually
at night act as a blanket


198
0:10:9,42 --> 0:10:11,3
and will warm the planet.


199
0:10:11,3 --> 0:10:12,3
So the question now remains,


200
0:10:12,3 --> 0:10:15,3
"Why in the world
are they spraying?"


201
0:10:15,3 --> 0:10:18,6
One of the things that
geoengineering is about,


202
0:10:18,6 --> 0:10:20,57
when you're environmentally
doing something


203
0:10:20,57 --> 0:10:22,24
with the atmosphere,


204
0:10:22,24 --> 0:10:25,3
is that you can be engaged
in weather modification.


205
0:10:25,3 --> 0:10:27,18
Historically, weather
modification


206
0:10:27,18 --> 0:10:29,75
in the United States began
to be looked upon


207
0:10:29,75 --> 0:10:41,51
in the 1940s as something
that people would want to do.


208
0:10:41,51 --> 0:10:45,42
And so they started looking
at making it--enhancing snow,


209
0:10:45,42 --> 0:10:46,6
enhancing rain.


210
0:10:46,6 --> 0:10:49,78
They started looking
at hurricane control.


211
0:10:49,78 --> 0:10:52,12
There was a whole bunch
of projects in the '40s


212
0:10:52,12 --> 0:10:53,81
that started.


213
0:10:53,81 --> 0:10:56,63
One was Project Stormfury,
which turned into a disaster


214
0:10:56,63 --> 0:10:59,57
when they tried to modify
a hurricane.


215
0:10:59,57 --> 0:11:8,87
I'm Mark McCandlish.


216
0:11:8,87 --> 0:11:10,75
And for the better part
of 30 years, I worked


217
0:11:10,75 --> 0:11:13,63
in the Aerospace and Defense
Industry.


218
0:11:13,63 --> 0:11:16,78
I had a secret clearance
twice during my career.


219
0:11:16,78 --> 0:11:20,72
Some of the technology that I
saw or participated


220
0:11:20,72 --> 0:11:23,48
in the creation of
tends to play a role


221
0:11:23,48 --> 0:11:28,63
in, um, some of the things that
are used to control the weather.


222
0:11:28,63 --> 0:11:31,81
The very distribution processes
being employed


223
0:11:31,81 --> 0:11:33,81
in the aerosol campaign--


224
0:11:33,81 --> 0:11:36,87
manipulating the weather, crops,
um, you know,


225
0:11:36,87 --> 0:11:40,9
taking over the--the, uh,
the food production


226
0:11:40,9 --> 0:11:42,27
or controlling the food
production,


227
0:11:42,27 --> 0:11:43,69
the military applications--


228
0:11:43,69 --> 0:11:47,3
the process evolved
when they realized in the--


229
0:11:47,3 --> 0:11:50,3
in the 1800s that you can put
things into the environment


230
0:11:50,3 --> 0:11:53,3
that will influence
the uptake of moisture


231
0:11:53,3 --> 0:12:6,66
and where it drops
out of the atmosphere again.


232
0:12:6,66 --> 0:12:15,51
My name is Scott Stevens.


233
0:12:15,51 --> 0:12:18,57
I, uh, was a television
weatherman for 20 years.


234
0:12:18,57 --> 0:12:23,12
These chemtrails are absolutely
required to impact


235
0:12:23,12 --> 0:12:26,36
whatever weather event
they were designing.


236
0:12:26,36 --> 0:12:30,39
And the trails were an absolute
necessary ingredient


237
0:12:30,39 --> 0:12:33,6
for them to achieve their
weather modification goals.


238
0:12:33,6 --> 0:12:37,48
So we're finding the aerosols,
the metal particulates,


239
0:12:37,48 --> 0:12:41,12
all of those can be used
and leveraged to create


240
0:12:41,12 --> 0:12:44,36
weather events that are
several standard deviations


241
0:12:44,36 --> 0:12:47,21
or outside what would be
typically normal.


242
0:12:47,21 --> 0:12:49,51
When the geoengineering really
got underway with the Russians


243
0:12:49,51 --> 0:12:52,42
in the mid-'70s, we ended up
with snow in Miami.


244
0:12:52,42 --> 0:12:55,51
We ended up even with frost
deep into Mexico.


245
0:12:55,51 --> 0:12:58,15
You know, the bizarreness
of the weather really exploded


246
0:12:58,15 --> 0:13:0,69
on the scene when, uh,
when weather engineering


247
0:13:0,69 --> 0:13:2,6
got going in the mid-'70s.


248
0:13:2,6 --> 0:13:5,51
The Dakotas, in winter,
they recorded a temperature


249
0:13:5,51 --> 0:13:8,9
of almost 100 degrees,
94 degrees.


250
0:13:8,9 --> 0:13:10,63
It broke the former record
by 32 degrees.


251
0:13:10,63 --> 0:13:12,72
There's very profound things
that people don't notice.


252
0:13:12,72 --> 0:13:14,21
Blue skies almost never.


253
0:13:14,21 --> 0:13:16,9
We almost never have dew
on the ground.


254
0:13:16,9 --> 0:13:18,51
That's a known consequence of
geoengineering, if they did it,


255
0:13:18,51 --> 0:13:19,72
which they appear to be.


256
0:13:19,72 --> 0:13:21,24
It sucks the moisture out
of the atmosphere.


257
0:13:21,24 --> 0:13:22,81
It doesn't descend,
doesn't form dew.


258
0:13:22,81 --> 0:13:24,57
We have massive temperature
disruptions.


259
0:13:24,57 --> 0:13:27,27
People are starting to wonder,
"Why is it 80 degrees one day


260
0:13:27,27 --> 0:13:30,87
"and then snowing the next day
at 50 degrees or 45 degrees,


261
0:13:30,87 --> 0:13:32,66
and then back up to 80
the day after that?"


262
0:13:32,66 --> 0:13:35,12
When you push and pull
the climate with these--


263
0:13:35,12 --> 0:13:37,3
these manipulations programs,
of which there's


264
0:13:37,3 --> 0:13:40,0
a mountain of data
to corroborate their existence,


265
0:13:40,0 --> 0:13:44,45
then you start to have massive
fluctuations in the system.


266
0:13:44,45 --> 0:13:47,3
And we saw in March,
in the continental U.S.


267
0:13:47,3 --> 0:13:50,48
there were 15,232 temperature
records broken.


268
0:13:50,48 --> 0:13:52,3
That's profound.


269
0:13:52,3 --> 0:13:54,45
Some of the daytime highs,
the former records were broken


270
0:13:54,45 --> 0:13:57,18
by as much as 32 degrees.


271
0:13:57,18 --> 0:14:0,69
Don't people wonder what
in the world is going on?


272
0:14:0,69 --> 0:14:4,3
Whether they want to make it
snow at 45, 46, 47 degrees--


273
0:14:4,3 --> 0:14:7,9
I remember when 38, 39
was a big deal.


274
0:14:7,9 --> 0:14:10,21
Those kind of snowfalls
in the upper 30s.


275
0:14:10,21 --> 0:14:12,33
And now that's been pushed
into the 40s.


276
0:14:12,33 --> 0:14:14,18
There's a patent called


277
0:14:14,18 --> 0:14:17,57
"Ice nucleation for Weather
Modification".


278
0:14:17,57 --> 0:14:19,51
This is a patent from NASA.


279
0:14:19,51 --> 0:14:22,57
It can be found online
in its full form.


280
0:14:22,57 --> 0:14:27,36
This patent is for the creation
of artificial snowstorms


281
0:14:27,36 --> 0:14:29,69
from what would have been
rainstorms.


282
0:14:29,69 --> 0:14:31,6
However preposterous it sounds
to people,


283
0:14:31,6 --> 0:14:34,6
if they look up
"Chinese create snowstorms",


284
0:14:34,6 --> 0:14:38,15
they will find a long list
of articles


285
0:14:38,15 --> 0:14:40,45
where the Chinese Bureau
of Weather Modification


286
0:14:40,45 --> 0:14:43,33
openly admitted that they were
creating snowstorms


287
0:14:43,33 --> 0:14:45,6
until they did a billion
dollars' worth of damage


288
0:14:45,6 --> 0:14:46,3
in Beijing.


289
0:14:46,3 --> 0:14:49,6
So my question would be,
if the Chinese can do this,


290
0:14:49,6 --> 0:14:52,87
and NASA has a patent
for the same purpose,


291
0:14:52,87 --> 0:14:55,6
why would we believe snow events
here are natural,


292
0:14:55,6 --> 0:14:58,84
when it's snowing now,
regularly, at 45 degrees,


293
0:14:58,84 --> 0:15:0,36
sometimes 50 degrees--


294
0:15:0,36 --> 0:15:3,3
heavy, wet, concrete snow
that's full of aluminum,


295
0:15:3,3 --> 0:15:5,27
full of barium,
full of strontium?


296
0:15:5,27 --> 0:15:8,21
Consider the ice pack
in their first aid kit


297
0:15:8,21 --> 0:15:11,45
that can sit dormant
at room temperature for decades,


298
0:15:11,45 --> 0:15:13,3
until the chemicals
are mixed together,


299
0:15:13,3 --> 0:15:14,45
at which time it creates ice.


300
0:15:14,45 --> 0:15:16,42
As an on-air meteorologist,


301
0:15:16,42 --> 0:15:19,36
I had a responsibility
to my audience.


302
0:15:19,36 --> 0:15:22,27
There were storms that were not
behaving as they were modeled


303
0:15:22,27 --> 0:15:25,66
or they historically
would have responded.


304
0:15:25,66 --> 0:15:29,66
If you can control where
moisture is collected


305
0:15:29,66 --> 0:15:33,18
and where it's dropped,
so to speak,


306
0:15:33,18 --> 0:15:35,78
in the form of rain or any other
kind of precipitation,


307
0:15:35,78 --> 0:15:38,21
then you can really--you can
do everything.


308
0:15:38,21 --> 0:15:39,84
You can steer
the weather system.


309
0:15:39,84 --> 0:15:43,57
If you want to be able
to manipulate the weather,


310
0:15:43,57 --> 0:15:45,45
one of the things we know about
the materials


311
0:15:45,45 --> 0:15:47,6
that are being used
in the aerosols--


312
0:15:47,6 --> 0:15:51,63
we--we've seen everything
from aluminum oxide,


313
0:15:51,63 --> 0:15:55,15
barium salts, strontium,
copper sulfate,


314
0:15:55,15 --> 0:15:58,6
uh, potassium iodide, um,


315
0:15:58,6 --> 0:15:59,57
a number of different kinds
of things,


316
0:15:59,57 --> 0:16:2,39
each of which have different
levels of reactivity


317
0:16:2,39 --> 0:16:4,6
with the moisture in the air.


318
0:16:4,6 --> 0:16:6,87
Some, like aluminum oxide,


319
0:16:6,87 --> 0:16:8,69
tends to sequester
the moisture.


320
0:16:8,69 --> 0:16:10,69
The aluminum oxide
nanoparticles,


321
0:16:10,69 --> 0:16:14,57
which are microscopically fine
and uniform in size,


322
0:16:14,57 --> 0:16:17,48
attract the humidity
and the moisture in the air,


323
0:16:17,48 --> 0:16:21,21
and they can--it basically forms
like a nucleation process,


324
0:16:21,21 --> 0:16:23,69
where the moisture condenses
on these particles.


325
0:16:23,69 --> 0:16:25,78
The--with cloud seeding,
the cooling will be achieved


326
0:16:25,78 --> 0:16:28,66
by making clouds reflect
a bit more sunlight


327
0:16:28,66 --> 0:16:30,66
back to space
than they would otherwise.


328
0:16:30,66 --> 0:16:32,51
And less sunlight reaching
the surface would tend


329
0:16:32,51 --> 0:16:34,0
to cool the planet.


330
0:16:34,0 --> 0:16:36,6
These aerosol particle act--
particles act


331
0:16:36,6 --> 0:16:38,27
as something called
cloud condensation nuclei,


332
0:16:38,27 --> 0:16:42,27
and, um, this is--these are
sites where--


333
0:16:42,27 --> 0:16:46,24
these particles act as sites
where cloud drops can form.


334
0:16:46,24 --> 0:16:48,69
Well, the one thing that
we know has happened is,


335
0:16:48,69 --> 0:16:51,78
because these
are nanoparticles,


336
0:16:51,78 --> 0:16:55,36
and they float like mad
with a little bit of, uh,


337
0:16:55,36 --> 0:16:57,9
moisture added to them.


338
0:16:57,9 --> 0:16:59,9
They go over
the Continental Divide.


339
0:16:59,9 --> 0:17:1,81
They dumped all
of California's rain


340
0:17:1,81 --> 0:17:4,0
into the Mississippi Valley,
which is the reason


341
0:17:4,0 --> 0:17:8,27
they're having floods
and tornadoes and fierce storms


342
0:17:8,27 --> 0:17:10,21
and odd weather back east.


343
0:17:10,21 --> 0:17:13,69
The effect here
in California is drought.


344
0:17:13,69 --> 0:17:16,81
Now, then, if you hit
that area of the sky


345
0:17:16,81 --> 0:17:20,75
with a beam of a particular kind
of radiation,


346
0:17:20,75 --> 0:17:22,54
and you can heat
those particles up,


347
0:17:22,54 --> 0:17:24,66
just like heating up,
you know,


348
0:17:24,66 --> 0:17:27,39
your--your cup of coffee
in the microwave,


349
0:17:27,39 --> 0:17:30,6
these particles begin
to vibrate and resonate,


350
0:17:30,6 --> 0:17:34,45
if you use the right frequency
of--of, uh, RF energy,


351
0:17:34,45 --> 0:17:36,87
that they then heat
the surrounding air,


352
0:17:36,87 --> 0:17:38,15
and they will take all
of that air


353
0:17:38,15 --> 0:17:39,78
and the moisture
that is in it


354
0:17:39,78 --> 0:17:41,72
to a higher altitude,
where it's much colder,


355
0:17:41,72 --> 0:17:44,63
and it'll condense and then
become a low pressure system.


356
0:17:44,63 --> 0:17:48,3
Well, there--there's a couple
of locations


357
0:17:48,3 --> 0:17:49,42
where they tend to be
very interested


358
0:17:49,42 --> 0:17:52,9
in--in leaving their trails.


359
0:17:52,9 --> 0:17:54,18
The big one and the surprising
one for me


360
0:17:54,18 --> 0:17:56,33
is under areas
of high pressure,


361
0:17:56,33 --> 0:17:58,69
where you would--you would
expect to see the blue skies,


362
0:17:58,69 --> 0:17:59,84
the dry conditions.


363
0:17:59,84 --> 0:18:3,27
Those are prime targets
for trailing.


364
0:18:3,27 --> 0:18:4,51
Couple of reasons:


365
0:18:4,51 --> 0:18:6,36
High pressure is--is stable.


366
0:18:6,36 --> 0:18:8,36
It's relatively still.


367
0:18:8,36 --> 0:18:11,6
You know, we've got the, uh--
the clockwise flow around it.


368
0:18:11,6 --> 0:18:15,54
And if you accentuate the high,
so it's very easy


369
0:18:15,54 --> 0:18:17,87
to add those particulates
of aluminum, barium,


370
0:18:17,87 --> 0:18:19,42
and whatever else
they want to put in there,


371
0:18:19,42 --> 0:18:21,36
and as you add heat to that,


372
0:18:21,36 --> 0:18:23,63
those particulates then
radiate the heat


373
0:18:23,63 --> 0:18:26,21
into the atmosphere,
and it warms.


374
0:18:26,21 --> 0:18:27,75
And what does a warming
atmosphere do?


375
0:18:27,75 --> 0:18:30,27
Boom, it expands.


376
0:18:30,27 --> 0:18:31,54
So that's one way.


377
0:18:31,54 --> 0:18:34,69
It's a very simple way,
but it's very apparent,


378
0:18:34,69 --> 0:18:37,75
because under the high pressure,
it's supposed to be quiet.


379
0:18:37,75 --> 0:18:38,84
It's supposed to be still.


380
0:18:38,84 --> 0:18:40,81
It's supposed to be blue.


381
0:18:40,81 --> 0:18:42,54
And we're not seeing that.


382
0:18:42,54 --> 0:18:46,66
Then as the storm approaches,
the high begins to recede.


383
0:18:46,66 --> 0:18:48,39
And then they're running
the flights back and forth,


384
0:18:48,39 --> 0:18:50,33
back and forth,
back and forth,


385
0:18:50,33 --> 0:18:53,75
and literally seeding
the leading edges of the cirrus.


386
0:18:53,75 --> 0:18:56,21
So the cirrus canopy
is accentuated.


387
0:18:56,21 --> 0:19:0,24
That cirrus canopy, which
would maybe be 200, 300 miles


388
0:19:0,24 --> 0:19:6,42
at a head--at a head of a cold
front is now 400, 450 miles.


389
0:19:6,42 --> 0:19:10,78
Based on geoengineering data,


390
0:19:10,78 --> 0:19:14,39
it would appear
the Pacific Northwest gets


391
0:19:14,39 --> 0:19:17,54
an excessive amount of--
of the fallout


392
0:19:17,54 --> 0:19:20,42
from these programs,
because much of the weather,


393
0:19:20,42 --> 0:19:22,81
much of the precipitation
in the storm tracks


394
0:19:22,81 --> 0:19:25,3
and the jet stream
move across us.


395
0:19:25,3 --> 0:19:28,78
So, as stated by globally
recognized geoengineers


396
0:19:28,78 --> 0:19:30,15
like David Keith,


397
0:19:30,15 --> 0:19:32,45
that that's the type of area
they would want


398
0:19:32,45 --> 0:19:34,45
to seed these particulates,


399
0:19:34,45 --> 0:19:39,18
as incoming fronts start
to cover landfall,


400
0:19:39,18 --> 0:19:40,42
and that's exactly
what we see here.


401
0:19:40,42 --> 0:19:41,78
When there's any kind
of incoming front,


402
0:19:41,78 --> 0:19:43,45
we see jets everywhere.


403
0:19:43,45 --> 0:19:46,3
The global studies indicate
there will be some impact


404
0:19:46,3 --> 0:19:48,0
on precipitation patterns,


405
0:19:48,0 --> 0:19:49,51
and obviously, there's a lot
more opportunity


406
0:19:49,51 --> 0:19:50,78
for work in that area.


407
0:19:50,78 --> 0:19:53,33
After studying
my time lapse surveillance,


408
0:19:53,33 --> 0:19:55,36
one of the reasons
I discovered for the trails


409
0:19:55,36 --> 0:19:58,0
was that the persistent ones
would break.


410
0:19:58,0 --> 0:19:59,57
They would misshape it
or deform,


411
0:19:59,57 --> 0:20:2,42
and other planes would come
along and precisely mark off


412
0:20:2,42 --> 0:20:4,57
those locations of--
of deformation.


413
0:20:4,57 --> 0:20:6,48
And you're not gonna get that
with a regular fleet,


414
0:20:6,48 --> 0:20:9,72
so this had to be one
of the primary purposes


415
0:20:9,72 --> 0:20:12,84
for chemtrails, in my opinion,
was to measure off


416
0:20:12,84 --> 0:20:15,33
where we have these
discontinuities showing up


417
0:20:15,33 --> 0:20:16,75
in the atmosphere.


418
0:20:16,75 --> 0:20:19,87
And in doing these actions
and discovering those zones


419
0:20:19,87 --> 0:20:21,84
where there's different
energies in the atmosphere,


420
0:20:21,84 --> 0:20:23,45
I think that plays
very closely


421
0:20:23,45 --> 0:20:26,51
into their
weather engineering programs


422
0:20:26,51 --> 0:20:29,75
of mark, surveil,
and then that data goes


423
0:20:29,75 --> 0:20:31,78
into--into a weather model
that they can then use


424
0:20:31,78 --> 0:20:33,69
to forecast, or, once again,


425
0:20:33,69 --> 0:20:35,72
engineer the weather
to their designs.


426
0:20:35,72 --> 0:20:39,57
But you can also influence
what happens locally


427
0:20:39,57 --> 0:20:42,36
with the atmosphere
by, um,


428
0:20:42,36 --> 0:20:47,15
painting the materials that
these aerosols are made of


429
0:20:47,15 --> 0:20:50,78
with different kinds of radio
frequency, or RF energy--


430
0:20:50,78 --> 0:20:54,51
radar, microwave,
the HAARP system.


431
0:20:54,51 --> 0:20:57,21
You know, HAARP is, um, uh,
an array,


432
0:20:57,21 --> 0:20:59,81
a field of antennas,
radio frequency antennas.


433
0:20:59,81 --> 0:21:2,45
They're 72 feet tall,
then they have a crosstie


434
0:21:2,45 --> 0:21:5,63
pulled across the top that's
about 60 feet in each direction.


435
0:21:5,63 --> 0:21:8,24
180 of these are
in the array today,


436
0:21:8,24 --> 0:21:11,66
so you can imagine this field
of antennas.


437
0:21:11,66 --> 0:21:15,39
What happens is,
by firing each one,


438
0:21:15,39 --> 0:21:18,21
they produce radio frequency
energy that normally comes off


439
0:21:18,21 --> 0:21:20,87
of an antenna, spreads out
rather rapidly.


440
0:21:20,87 --> 0:21:30,66
Same principle...


441
0:21:30,66 --> 0:21:32,6
principles in physics
would be like a flashlight


442
0:21:32,6 --> 0:21:33,72
shining on a wall.


443
0:21:33,72 --> 0:21:35,3
You know, you start
with a narrow beam,


444
0:21:35,3 --> 0:21:37,69
and by the time you hit the
wall, you've got a wide beam.


445
0:21:37,69 --> 0:21:41,51
The idea with HAARP is to
get it to focus or concentrate


446
0:21:41,51 --> 0:21:43,69
that radio frequency energy
so it doesn't spread out,


447
0:21:43,69 --> 0:21:47,0
so you can hold it tighter
together and then manipulate it


448
0:21:47,0 --> 0:21:48,66
in very specific ways.


449
0:21:48,66 --> 0:21:51,51
Weather control
is a broad topic.


450
0:21:51,51 --> 0:21:53,87
So there's lots of ways to
control or manipulate weather.


451
0:21:53,87 --> 0:21:55,45
HAARP is one of them.


452
0:21:55,45 --> 0:21:57,42
Because you also have
private sector companies


453
0:21:57,42 --> 0:22:0,54
getting into this business
of weather modification.


454
0:22:0,54 --> 0:22:3,0
In the case of HAARP,
do you need, uh--


455
0:22:3,0 --> 0:22:4,36
People always ask me,
you know,


456
0:22:4,36 --> 0:22:7,54
"Do you need particulates
dispersed in the atmosphere


457
0:22:7,54 --> 0:22:8,69
to make it more effective?"


458
0:22:8,69 --> 0:22:10,12
You actually don't.


459
0:22:10,12 --> 0:22:11,84
Would it make things
more possible?


460
0:22:11,84 --> 0:22:13,6
Could you enhance
certain effects?


461
0:22:13,6 --> 0:22:14,33
Probably so.


462
0:22:14,33 --> 0:22:16,78
Could you control energy
distributions more efficiently?


463
0:22:16,78 --> 0:22:19,45
Probably so, because you're
putting in conductors


464
0:22:19,45 --> 0:22:21,3
or you're putting
in reflectors.


465
0:22:21,3 --> 0:22:23,69
You're putting in
particulate material.


466
0:22:23,69 --> 0:22:25,27
If you've ever experienced
a hailstorm


467
0:22:25,27 --> 0:22:26,75
and you've picked up
one of the hailstones,


468
0:22:26,75 --> 0:22:28,63
and you slice it open
with a razor blade,


469
0:22:28,63 --> 0:22:32,12
you'll see that it's layer
upon layer upon layer of ice.


470
0:22:32,12 --> 0:22:35,9
Now, hail is usually formed
where you have


471
0:22:35,9 --> 0:22:36,27
a low-pressure system


472
0:22:36,27 --> 0:22:38,54
where there's a tremendous
updraft of air.


473
0:22:38,54 --> 0:22:40,51
The air gets warmed up
by the sunlight


474
0:22:40,51 --> 0:22:41,84
ahead of the storm.


475
0:22:41,84 --> 0:22:43,24
The air rises.


476
0:22:43,24 --> 0:22:45,48
It takes the moisture
that's in the air


477
0:22:45,48 --> 0:22:47,87
up to a higher altitude,
where it's much colder.


478
0:22:47,87 --> 0:22:51,9
The moisture begins to condense
into water droplets,


479
0:22:51,9 --> 0:22:53,39
but the updraft is so powerful
that the water is carried


480
0:22:53,39 --> 0:22:56,3
to extreme altitudes,
where it freezes,


481
0:22:56,3 --> 0:22:58,9
and it begins to fall.


482
0:22:58,9 --> 0:23:1,51
And as it falls,
it starts to be caught up


483
0:23:1,51 --> 0:23:3,27
in the updraft again,


484
0:23:3,27 --> 0:23:5,3
so it's circulated
up into the air again.


485
0:23:5,3 --> 0:23:8,48
And so each time it's
lofted up into the atmosphere,


486
0:23:8,48 --> 0:23:11,6
more of the moisture that is
condensing on the outside


487
0:23:11,6 --> 0:23:13,72
of this--
this nuclei of ice


488
0:23:13,72 --> 0:23:16,18
begins to form another layer,
another layer.


489
0:23:16,18 --> 0:23:18,63
And each time it's caught back
in the updraft,


490
0:23:18,63 --> 0:23:20,72
it goes up again, and it gets
another layer of ice.


491
0:23:20,72 --> 0:23:24,0
And so, if you have
a system like HAARP


492
0:23:24,0 --> 0:23:27,72
working in conjunction
with aerosols,


493
0:23:27,72 --> 0:23:30,9
chemtrails that are spraying
in the air,


494
0:23:30,9 --> 0:23:33,27
you can actually create updrafts
that are so powerful


495
0:23:33,27 --> 0:23:35,87
that you can have these
hailstone circulation patterns


496
0:23:35,87 --> 0:23:37,87
going over and over again,
where you get hailstones


497
0:23:37,87 --> 0:23:58,21
the size of baseballs,
or even softballs.


498
0:23:58,21 --> 0:24:9,3
The weather has always been
a strategic...


499
0:24:9,3 --> 0:24:11,15
desire to control
by the generals,


500
0:24:11,15 --> 0:24:14,87
whether it was Napoleon,
marching towards Moscow,


501
0:24:14,87 --> 0:24:17,24
or Hitler,
in his Russian campaign,


502
0:24:17,24 --> 0:24:22,0
or our own Pacific fleet
trying to understand typhoons


503
0:24:22,0 --> 0:24:24,84
and use them
for our strategic advantage.


504
0:24:24,84 --> 0:24:27,87
War and weather are
very closely connected.


505
0:24:27,87 --> 0:24:31,72
And they've been connected
ever since about 1812 or so,


506
0:24:31,72 --> 0:24:33,21
maybe earlier than that.


507
0:24:33,21 --> 0:24:35,54
Hannibal had to face
the snows in the Alps.


508
0:24:35,54 --> 0:24:37,39
And so there's
a long history


509
0:24:37,39 --> 0:24:40,3
of weather
and warfare interactions.


510
0:24:40,3 --> 0:24:44,36
Environmental manipulation
is like the ultimate method


511
0:24:44,36 --> 0:24:46,63
of covert warfare because you
can literally shut down


512
0:24:46,63 --> 0:24:47,78
food production.


513
0:24:47,78 --> 0:24:50,78
You can create a situation
where the people


514
0:24:50,78 --> 0:24:53,36
within a country revolt
against their own government,


515
0:24:53,36 --> 0:24:56,45
and you're invited in
to mop up the mess.


516
0:24:56,45 --> 0:24:58,78
The issue of owning
the weather by 2025,


517
0:24:58,78 --> 0:25:0,57
it's this
military publication.


518
0:25:0,57 --> 0:25:5,42
We've quoted it as far back
as, I think, '94 or '95, even.


519
0:25:5,42 --> 0:25:8,63
But you go back
to these earlier reports,


520
0:25:8,63 --> 0:25:11,21
and you look at, sort of,
what was the objective?


521
0:25:11,21 --> 0:25:13,15
And the objective
is exactly that:


522
0:25:13,15 --> 0:25:15,75
control the battlefield
environment.


523
0:25:15,75 --> 0:25:19,24
Environmental factors give you
an absolute advantage.


524
0:25:19,24 --> 0:25:22,9
If you can weaken your adversary
before you have to fire


525
0:25:22,9 --> 0:25:24,21
the first bullet,
maybe you even win the war.


526
0:25:24,21 --> 0:25:27,54
Whether it's incredibly
historic sandstorms


527
0:25:27,54 --> 0:25:29,33
when we're invading Iraq,


528
0:25:29,33 --> 0:25:31,78
or you want to drought out
or flood out a dictator


529
0:25:31,78 --> 0:25:33,45
that you're not happy with


530
0:25:33,45 --> 0:25:35,66
or obscure a beach
when there's a landing,


531
0:25:35,66 --> 0:25:38,36
or if you just want to make
money on the futures market.


532
0:25:38,36 --> 0:25:43,6
Owning the weather by 2025,
using the weather


533
0:25:43,6 --> 0:25:44,81
as a force multiplier.


534
0:25:44,81 --> 0:25:46,42
And this kind of goes back
to what I was saying before


535
0:25:46,42 --> 0:25:47,72
about if you can--


536
0:25:47,72 --> 0:25:51,6
if you can control where
a weather system goes


537
0:25:51,6 --> 0:25:55,12
and how much or how severe
the weather system is,


538
0:25:55,12 --> 0:25:58,3
then you can do other things.


539
0:25:58,3 --> 0:26:2,18
Like you may have heard
more recently


540
0:26:2,18 --> 0:26:4,63
that many of the aircraft
that we've been developing


541
0:26:4,63 --> 0:26:6,54
are what they call
"all-weather capable,"


542
0:26:6,54 --> 0:26:8,6
which means that they can fly
in any kind of weather.


543
0:26:8,6 --> 0:26:12,0
They can shoot and target
the enemy


544
0:26:12,0 --> 0:26:15,42
under really nasty weather
circumstances.


545
0:26:15,42 --> 0:26:17,81
And these are all things that
you can use to your advantage


546
0:26:17,81 --> 0:26:19,81
if you happen to be controlling
the weather, also,


547
0:26:19,81 --> 0:26:22,57
because you can have
a terrible storm front come in


548
0:26:22,57 --> 0:26:24,24
and make it difficult,
if not impossible,


549
0:26:24,24 --> 0:26:26,84
for the enemy to operate
on the ground


550
0:26:26,84 --> 0:26:28,36
or to fly their aircraft


551
0:26:28,36 --> 0:26:31,54
if they don't have aircraft
that are as sophisticated


552
0:26:31,54 --> 0:26:33,9
as the ones that you have.


553
0:26:33,9 --> 0:26:36,75
And so, by creating or using
the weather


554
0:26:36,75 --> 0:26:40,9
as a force multiplier,
as the title implies,


555
0:26:40,9 --> 0:26:44,3
that you can achieve
an advantage over an enemy force


556
0:26:44,3 --> 0:26:46,18
that gives you the upper hand.


557
0:26:46,18 --> 0:26:48,24
One of the ideals of the--
of the Air Force


558
0:26:48,24 --> 0:26:49,84
is to have this all-weather
Air Force,


559
0:26:49,84 --> 0:26:53,39
or to have their pilots
coming back safely


560
0:26:53,39 --> 0:26:56,45
and using the weather
as a salient against the enemy


561
0:26:56,45 --> 0:26:58,6
and clearing out
their own airports


562
0:26:58,6 --> 0:27:1,33
from, say, from ice, fogs,
or from bad weather.


563
0:27:1,33 --> 0:27:3,72
And so if we could--if--
the idea here is that


564
0:27:3,72 --> 0:27:4,81
if we can fly
and they can't,


565
0:27:4,81 --> 0:27:7,6
that's a great military
advantage.


566
0:27:7,6 --> 0:27:10,39
There was also research studies
on hurricanes


567
0:27:10,39 --> 0:27:13,75
that the scientists were truly
curious about the behavior


568
0:27:13,75 --> 0:27:15,9
of hurricanes,


569
0:27:15,9 --> 0:27:17,42
but their military patrons
were very interested


570
0:27:17,42 --> 0:27:20,51
in how to steer them
or direct them in certain ways,


571
0:27:20,51 --> 0:27:22,84
almost as a--
as a guided weapon.


572
0:27:22,84 --> 0:27:25,48
This jet stream's moving
across, and it shoots


573
0:27:25,48 --> 0:27:29,0
50 miles north
and then 75 miles east


574
0:27:29,0 --> 0:27:32,24
and then drops back south again
and kind of goes on its way.


575
0:27:32,24 --> 0:27:34,27
And they attributed
that little dog leg


576
0:27:34,27 --> 0:27:36,33
in the jet stream in Alaska


577
0:27:36,33 --> 0:27:40,15
to swinging storm systems
out of Central Texas


578
0:27:40,15 --> 0:27:42,0
into Central Florida,


579
0:27:42,0 --> 0:27:44,9
where they deposited a couple
of tornadoes


580
0:27:44,9 --> 0:27:45,33
in the middle of Orlando


581
0:27:45,33 --> 0:27:47,24
that were, like, really rare
to see in that part


582
0:27:47,24 --> 0:27:48,51
of the country.


583
0:27:48,51 --> 0:27:49,81
And so people remember
that event,


584
0:27:49,81 --> 0:27:51,57
and they remember
that situation.


585
0:27:51,57 --> 0:27:54,63
But it'd be a good example
of a very small change in Alaska


586
0:27:54,63 --> 0:27:56,39
in terms of a jet stream,


587
0:27:56,39 --> 0:27:58,42
and what kind
of a lower-48 effect


588
0:27:58,42 --> 0:27:59,69
that would have.


589
0:27:59,69 --> 0:28:2,72
And that's again where
weather modification,


590
0:28:2,72 --> 0:28:6,3
small input in one place
could have tremendous change


591
0:28:6,3 --> 0:28:8,27
and unexpected outcome
in another.


592
0:28:8,27 --> 0:28:11,6
You can create weather systems
that are so severe,


593
0:28:11,6 --> 0:28:16,45
they culminate
in battlefield denial,


594
0:28:16,45 --> 0:28:19,63
where the enemy is not able
to use the roads


595
0:28:19,63 --> 0:28:22,9
or the bridges or--or get
through the environment


596
0:28:22,9 --> 0:28:24,69
because the weather
is so severe.


597
0:28:24,69 --> 0:28:29,3
And you can--you can use the
weather to destroy his crops,


598
0:28:29,3 --> 0:28:33,15
deny him a food source,
destabilize his population,


599
0:28:33,15 --> 0:28:35,0
because people get hungry,
and when they're hungry,


600
0:28:35,0 --> 0:28:37,18
they get angry and nasty,
and they don't like


601
0:28:37,18 --> 0:28:38,54
what's happening.


602
0:28:38,54 --> 0:28:40,27
So there's lots of different
things that you can do


603
0:28:40,27 --> 0:28:41,57
with the materials.


604
0:28:41,57 --> 0:28:43,9
It's all how you use them
in the environment,


605
0:28:43,9 --> 0:28:44,6
how you apply it.


606
0:28:44,6 --> 0:28:48,69
One of the biggest concerns
of early cloud seeding


607
0:28:48,69 --> 0:28:52,27
weather control activities by
the General Electric Corporation


608
0:28:52,27 --> 0:28:55,0
came from their lawyers,
who thought that the corporation


609
0:28:55,0 --> 0:28:57,66
was totally vulnerable
to lawsuits


610
0:28:57,66 --> 0:29:1,18
because if they started
to make fair or foul weather,


611
0:29:1,18 --> 0:29:3,81
the people down below
in Massachusetts,


612
0:29:3,81 --> 0:29:6,57
or downwind of Schenectady


613
0:29:6,57 --> 0:29:10,6
could institute massive
lawsuits that could put G.E.


614
0:29:10,6 --> 0:29:12,0
out of business.


615
0:29:12,0 --> 0:29:14,36
So the first response
to weather control


616
0:29:14,36 --> 0:29:18,18
from their in-house lawyers
was to shut it down,


617
0:29:18,18 --> 0:29:20,48
was to give the project
to the military


618
0:29:20,48 --> 0:29:23,6
and ask them to do it,
with the G.E. lawyers


619
0:29:23,6 --> 0:29:25,39
only being the consultants
on the project.


620
0:29:25,39 --> 0:29:28,45
So they were allowed
to suggest and, uh,


621
0:29:28,45 --> 0:29:29,66
design certain activities,


622
0:29:29,66 --> 0:29:31,36
but they weren't allowed
to touch anything


623
0:29:31,36 --> 0:29:32,87
or throw anything
out of the plane.


624
0:29:32,87 --> 0:29:35,81
The United States government,
during the Vietnam War,


625
0:29:35,81 --> 0:29:38,84
perfected weather
modification techniques,


626
0:29:38,84 --> 0:29:41,66
and also they perfected
releasing toxic chemicals


627
0:29:41,66 --> 0:29:46,3
like Agent Orange over many
areas to defoliate land,


628
0:29:46,3 --> 0:29:49,33
trees, grasslands,
and other areas.


629
0:29:49,33 --> 0:29:52,9
But this is technology that
does come up,


630
0:29:52,9 --> 0:29:53,63
and it comes up when--
when you see


631
0:29:53,63 --> 0:29:55,78
that the technology
has advanced far enough


632
0:29:55,78 --> 0:29:58,36
to where the practicality
of utilizing it


633
0:29:58,36 --> 0:29:59,57
in the battlefield environment


634
0:29:59,57 --> 0:30:2,36
and the temptation
by administrations--


635
0:30:2,36 --> 0:30:5,78
I mean, the best covert war
is using environment itself


636
0:30:5,78 --> 0:30:7,15
against your adversary.


637
0:30:7,15 --> 0:30:8,66
There was a military moment,
and it was actually


638
0:30:8,66 --> 0:30:11,3
from pretty recent history,


639
0:30:11,3 --> 0:30:14,6
and this was
the U.S. military thinking


640
0:30:14,6 --> 0:30:17,21
that they might be able
to control the monsoon


641
0:30:17,21 --> 0:30:20,36
over Vietnam
during that conflict.


642
0:30:20,36 --> 0:30:24,84
And so only a few--a handful
of top-level military advisors


643
0:30:24,84 --> 0:30:28,3
and the president were informed
that they were going to try


644
0:30:28,3 --> 0:30:31,6
to make it rain
over the Ho Chi Minh Trail


645
0:30:31,6 --> 0:30:32,69
and try to have
some military advantage


646
0:30:32,69 --> 0:30:34,87
by doing this kind
of intervention.


647
0:30:34,87 --> 0:30:37,6
When you start talking about
manipulating the environment,


648
0:30:37,6 --> 0:30:38,87
we have treaties that
go back to the mid-'70s


649
0:30:38,87 --> 0:30:41,27
that forbid this, number one,
as weapons of war.


650
0:30:41,27 --> 0:30:44,48
So the perfection of weather
modification took place,


651
0:30:44,48 --> 0:30:48,18
but it became apparent that
using weather modification


652
0:30:48,18 --> 0:30:50,81
for wartime purposes
was not acceptable


653
0:30:50,81 --> 0:30:52,39
to the United States
government


654
0:30:52,39 --> 0:30:54,21
and other nations
of the world.


655
0:30:54,21 --> 0:30:57,66
So therefore, the ENMOD Treaty
came into being


656
0:30:57,66 --> 0:31:1,3
and was signed
by the United States government


657
0:31:1,3 --> 0:31:3,63
after passing Congress.


658
0:31:3,63 --> 0:31:5,54
The reason it was signed
and implemented


659
0:31:5,54 --> 0:31:7,48
was because it would ban


660
0:31:7,48 --> 0:31:10,81
warfare weather
modification techniques


661
0:31:10,81 --> 0:31:13,36
and use
during times of war.


662
0:31:13,36 --> 0:31:15,3
Almost all of our treaties
that we've signed,


663
0:31:15,3 --> 0:31:17,84
including the non-proliferation,
counter-proliferation treaties,


664
0:31:17,84 --> 0:31:19,42
chemical treaties--you know,
the ones that were signed


665
0:31:19,42 --> 0:31:21,51
recently, the last few years,


666
0:31:21,51 --> 0:31:23,69
uh, you know, back maybe
a decade now, I guess.


667
0:31:23,69 --> 0:31:24,75
Times goes.


668
0:31:24,75 --> 0:31:28,9
But they had
domestic exemptions,


669
0:31:28,9 --> 0:31:30,21
and so does
the environmental treaty,


670
0:31:30,21 --> 0:31:31,66
where you can do
whatever you want


671
0:31:31,66 --> 0:31:34,3
in your own territorial
boundaries.


672
0:31:34,3 --> 0:31:35,72
I mean, you start manipulating
weather in one part of-


673
0:31:35,72 --> 0:31:37,27
of the planet, it doesn't look
on the ground and say,


674
0:31:37,27 --> 0:31:39,0
"Oh, yeah, wait.
This is the boundary of--


675
0:31:39,0 --> 0:31:40,42
a political boundary."


676
0:31:40,42 --> 0:31:42,0
It fails to recognize those.


677
0:31:42,0 --> 0:31:45,9
So you start to talk
about geophysics


678
0:31:45,9 --> 0:31:47,3
and manipulating
the planet itself.


679
0:31:47,3 --> 0:31:50,57
Then it's a question of--
those kinds of exemptions


680
0:31:50,57 --> 0:31:51,57
shouldn't even be allowed.


681
0:31:51,57 --> 0:31:53,12
Meteorology and the military


682
0:31:53,12 --> 0:31:55,36
have a very long history,
as I said.


683
0:31:55,36 --> 0:31:59,45
And it goes into this strategic
advantage that multiplies


684
0:31:59,45 --> 0:32:3,81
your traditional force--
that is, your armament--


685
0:32:3,81 --> 0:32:10,6
into using nature
to your advantage as well.


686
0:32:10,6 --> 0:32:14,24
They want to create a storm
in the Southeast,


687
0:32:14,24 --> 0:32:16,81
then they'll start engineering
out of the North Pacific.


688
0:32:16,81 --> 0:32:18,48
That's where the trails
will be,


689
0:32:18,48 --> 0:32:19,75
because you want
to work out


690
0:32:19,75 --> 0:32:23,12
several days ahead of time
so you have less input.


691
0:32:23,12 --> 0:32:25,6
And you multiply that
over a couple of days,


692
0:32:25,6 --> 0:32:28,12
you can have a big result
in five days' time.


693
0:32:28,12 --> 0:32:32,12
So small input upstream,
big result downstream.


694
0:32:32,12 --> 0:32:36,3
And one of the rules is
always work with what's coming.


695
0:32:36,3 --> 0:32:37,57
Don't try to necessarily work
against it.


696
0:32:37,57 --> 0:32:40,21
You can kill a storm in place.
That's easy to do with HAARP.


697
0:32:40,21 --> 0:32:41,63
You just change
the polarization.


698
0:32:41,63 --> 0:32:43,54
You change the ionization
of the atmosphere,


699
0:32:43,54 --> 0:32:45,3
and the storm
will fall apart.


700
0:32:45,3 --> 0:32:47,78
It will affect the setting up of
the storm tracks,


701
0:32:47,78 --> 0:32:50,36
the jet stream, the location
of the storms,


702
0:32:50,36 --> 0:32:52,57
and so you end up with--
an intervention


703
0:32:52,57 --> 0:32:57,27
on the solar side of things
would pretty directly begin


704
0:32:57,27 --> 0:33:0,15
to affect
the weather patterns.


705
0:33:0,15 --> 0:33:2,78
And so climate control,
or attempted climate control,


706
0:33:2,78 --> 0:33:5,27
and weather control lie
on this very large spectrum


707
0:33:5,27 --> 0:33:7,42
of intervention.


708
0:33:7,42 --> 0:33:10,72
It's also true that
if you can forecast climate,


709
0:33:10,72 --> 0:33:12,72
you can control
a lot of futures markets,


710
0:33:12,72 --> 0:33:15,54
and you could know--if you
had the best information,


711
0:33:15,54 --> 0:33:19,24
or if you had some leverage
over what the climate system


712
0:33:19,24 --> 0:33:20,54
is going to turn out to be,


713
0:33:20,54 --> 0:33:22,66
you would be able to invest
in advance


714
0:33:22,66 --> 0:33:24,3
and own your crop futures


715
0:33:24,3 --> 0:33:26,48
and your agricultural
activities and--


716
0:33:26,48 --> 0:33:29,3
And not just agriculture,
but weather affects--


717
0:33:29,3 --> 0:33:31,63
I think it's something like
80% of the U.S. economy


718
0:33:31,63 --> 0:33:33,51
is weather-sensitive.


719
0:33:33,51 --> 0:33:36,42
And so all kinds of businesses
would like to see


720
0:33:36,42 --> 0:33:41,87
some weather edge or some
advantageous information


721
0:33:41,87 --> 0:33:43,27
that they would have.


722
0:33:43,27 --> 0:33:45,45
It's absolutely, entirely
possible to profit


723
0:33:45,45 --> 0:33:54,21
from the weather.


724
0:33:54,21 --> 0:33:55,24
Hi, my name is Michael Agne.


725
0:33:55,24 --> 0:34:5,12
I'm an independent trader...


726
0:34:5,12 --> 0:34:8,9
trading commodities
at the C.M.E. Group,


727
0:34:8,9 --> 0:34:9,54
member of
the Chicago Board of Trade,


728
0:34:9,54 --> 0:34:11,75
and I've traded derivatives
and futures cash


729
0:34:11,75 --> 0:34:13,27
for over 15 years.


730
0:34:13,27 --> 0:34:15,12
Weather derivatives are
financial instruments


731
0:34:15,12 --> 0:34:17,6
that firms would use
to hedge risk


732
0:34:17,6 --> 0:34:19,39
concerned with adverse
weather conditions.


733
0:34:19,39 --> 0:34:22,15
The first weather derivative was
originally traded by Enron


734
0:34:22,15 --> 0:34:24,0
back in 1997.


735
0:34:24,0 --> 0:34:26,3
Weather derivatives started
in 1999 at the C.M.E. Group.


736
0:34:26,3 --> 0:34:30,6
Big utilities reinsures
to hedge against hurricanes


737
0:34:30,6 --> 0:34:34,21
or tornadoes or flooding,
some sort of catastrophe.


738
0:34:34,21 --> 0:34:37,84
Hedging against a cooler summer
or a warmer winter.


739
0:34:37,84 --> 0:34:40,0
Let's just say I was insuring
a product for 5 million,


740
0:34:40,0 --> 0:34:41,33
no matter what it was.


741
0:34:41,33 --> 0:34:42,51
Let's say if it was
a utility company,


742
0:34:42,51 --> 0:34:43,78
a farmer,
whatever it was.


743
0:34:43,78 --> 0:34:45,42
Let's say I had $5 million
worth of crop,


744
0:34:45,42 --> 0:34:47,54
but I can do derivatives that
are worth double that amount,


745
0:34:47,54 --> 0:34:50,24
and I can then control
the effects


746
0:34:50,24 --> 0:34:52,18
to where I collect
on the insurance


747
0:34:52,18 --> 0:34:53,42
that's worth 10 million,


748
0:34:53,42 --> 0:34:55,15
as opposed to selling the crop
for five million.


749
0:34:55,15 --> 0:34:56,54
Yes, I could definitely
profit from that.


750
0:34:56,54 --> 0:34:59,45
2010, 2011, Southern Illinois,
Missouri,


751
0:34:59,45 --> 0:35:0,51
those--those, you know,


752
0:35:0,51 --> 0:35:2,78
we had a high peak
of tornadoes,


753
0:35:2,78 --> 0:35:4,63
and those types
of adverse weather conditions


754
0:35:4,63 --> 0:35:6,81
definitely raised the price
of commodities


755
0:35:6,81 --> 0:35:8,75
as well as drove
the volatility,


756
0:35:8,75 --> 0:35:10,66
which also raises the price
of commodities.


757
0:35:10,66 --> 0:35:12,72
You're gonna make more money
if a crop fails.


758
0:35:12,72 --> 0:35:14,6
You're creating insurance
that's over the price


759
0:35:14,6 --> 0:35:16,6
of what your crop is worth,
let's say.


760
0:35:16,6 --> 0:35:17,87
So what if you can control
the weather?


761
0:35:17,87 --> 0:35:20,87
You control
how these products grow.


762
0:35:20,87 --> 0:35:22,12
And if you had an insight


763
0:35:22,12 --> 0:35:24,27
to how these products were
actually seeded


764
0:35:24,27 --> 0:35:28,45
and what products you used
to actually grow those items--


765
0:35:28,45 --> 0:35:31,6
corn, soybeans--and you can
control that market,


766
0:35:31,6 --> 0:35:34,87
it's unlimited profit potential
if you can control the weather.


767
0:35:34,87 --> 0:35:37,6
If you want to send you know,
cold into the Midwest,


768
0:35:37,6 --> 0:35:38,6
you buy at pipeline capacity,


769
0:35:38,6 --> 0:35:41,48
you buy up options on heating
and cooling degree days.


770
0:35:41,48 --> 0:35:44,33
You buy derivatives off of--
off of rainfall.


771
0:35:44,33 --> 0:35:46,72
There are mechanisms
that you can make


772
0:35:46,72 --> 0:35:49,72
hundreds of billions
of dollars annually


773
0:35:49,72 --> 0:35:52,39
and defray a huge chunk
of the cost of this


774
0:35:52,39 --> 0:35:54,3
just on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange,


775
0:35:54,3 --> 0:35:56,72
playing with derivatives
in the weather market.


776
0:35:56,72 --> 0:35:58,39
Weather derivatives are
basically--


777
0:35:58,39 --> 0:36:0,78
you're betting that there's
gonna be a weather disaster,


778
0:36:0,78 --> 0:36:3,3
and you're betting that it's
going to occur


779
0:36:3,3 --> 0:36:6,27
within a particular timeframe
in a particular location,


780
0:36:6,27 --> 0:36:8,48
and then, you know,
the money that you put up


781
0:36:8,48 --> 0:36:10,9
basically is like a bet.


782
0:36:10,9 --> 0:36:12,75
It's like a wager
saying that, uh,


783
0:36:12,75 --> 0:36:15,87
this incident's
gonna happen here.


784
0:36:15,87 --> 0:36:19,21
And then, when it does happen,
there's a big payoff.


785
0:36:19,21 --> 0:36:22,3
And that big payoff is something
that motivates people


786
0:36:22,3 --> 0:36:24,39
to continue to participate
in this kind of thing


787
0:36:24,39 --> 0:36:26,84
and maybe even feed
the very process


788
0:36:26,84 --> 0:36:29,33
that's causing the bad weather
to happen,


789
0:36:29,33 --> 0:36:30,69
particularly if there's
a connection


790
0:36:30,69 --> 0:36:32,54
between the people that are
seeding the clouds


791
0:36:32,54 --> 0:36:34,87
and the people that are
making investments.


792
0:36:34,87 --> 0:36:37,12
This is a new opportunity.


793
0:36:37,12 --> 0:36:48,9
It's a new tool
for investors.


794
0:36:48,9 --> 0:36:49,18
You know, even if, uh,


795
0:36:49,18 --> 0:36:51,0
someone has no interest in,
you know,


796
0:36:51,0 --> 0:36:55,42
going on the offensive side
and buying things, um,


797
0:36:55,42 --> 0:36:57,45
it definitely behooves them
to be aware


798
0:36:57,45 --> 0:36:58,69
of what's going on out there.


799
0:36:58,69 --> 0:37:0,15
The extreme weather is here.


800
0:37:0,15 --> 0:37:2,69
You know, and it's not gonna
reverse itself.


801
0:37:2,69 --> 0:37:5,9
The weather event has to be
severe.


802
0:37:5,9 --> 0:37:7,6
Ionospheric heating,
in fact,


803
0:37:7,6 --> 0:37:9,78
these instruments, um,
when they were first utilized,


804
0:37:9,78 --> 0:37:12,6
which was in the former
Soviet Union back in the '70s--


805
0:37:12,6 --> 0:37:13,75
they started out then--


806
0:37:13,75 --> 0:37:15,51
they still call these
ionospheric heaters


807
0:37:15,51 --> 0:37:17,78
because, in one mode
of operation,


808
0:37:17,78 --> 0:37:19,0
you can literally create--


809
0:37:19,0 --> 0:37:20,66
above this instrument
on the ground,


810
0:37:20,66 --> 0:37:24,33
you can heat an area 30--
up to 30 miles in diameter


811
0:37:24,33 --> 0:37:25,57
in the ionosphere.


812
0:37:25,57 --> 0:37:27,36
So you heat it up,
and by heating it,


813
0:37:27,36 --> 0:37:28,45
it literally raises it.


814
0:37:28,45 --> 0:37:30,54
So you can then imagine
this column


815
0:37:30,54 --> 0:37:32,84
moving up several hundred
kilometers out,


816
0:37:32,84 --> 0:37:35,69
and then the lower atmosphere
begins to rush in


817
0:37:35,69 --> 0:37:38,84
and fill that vacant space,
that void.


818
0:37:38,84 --> 0:37:41,78
And then, as a result,
you're altering pressure systems


819
0:37:41,78 --> 0:37:44,18
for, you know, quite a--
quite a distance,


820
0:37:44,18 --> 0:37:45,78
which of course
alters the weather.


821
0:37:45,78 --> 0:37:46,87
You're also able,


822
0:37:46,87 --> 0:37:48,24
if a jet stream is coming
in the area,


823
0:37:48,24 --> 0:37:49,81
you're able to alter
its course.


824
0:37:49,81 --> 0:37:52,18
And if you alter a jet stream
even a small amount,


825
0:37:52,18 --> 0:37:54,27
then the swing factor on the
other end,


826
0:37:54,27 --> 0:37:56,63
you can move it,
so you're moving storms, say,


827
0:37:56,63 --> 0:37:58,51
out of the Midwest
onto the East Coast


828
0:37:58,51 --> 0:37:59,81
or this kind of thing,


829
0:37:59,81 --> 0:38:3,57
by just swinging it high in--
in terms of its flow


830
0:38:3,57 --> 0:38:5,0
and getting it redirected.


831
0:38:5,0 --> 0:38:7,24
Okay, so now if we look
at precipitation,


832
0:38:7,24 --> 0:38:11,9
much has been made
of this issue of, uh,


833
0:38:11,9 --> 0:38:12,33
damage from precipitation.


834
0:38:12,33 --> 0:38:14,75
Which the particulates
that these trails intro--


835
0:38:14,75 --> 0:38:19,3
have a--have introduced
into the sky are--


836
0:38:19,3 --> 0:38:21,57
Let's just say the storms
can develop more violently,


837
0:38:21,57 --> 0:38:23,66
more quickly, um,
in places that are


838
0:38:23,66 --> 0:38:27,15
not necessarily as, uh, where
you would expect them to be.


839
0:38:27,15 --> 0:38:28,72
And so we see more flooding.


840
0:38:28,72 --> 0:38:30,57
We see more intense droughts.


841
0:38:30,57 --> 0:38:33,0
We see rainfall rates
of 1 to, you know,


842
0:38:33,0 --> 0:38:34,66
2 1/4 inches an hour


843
0:38:34,66 --> 0:38:36,48
that are just bizarre.


844
0:38:36,48 --> 0:38:39,84
And sometimes even rainfall,
you know, 1 1/4 inch a minute.


845
0:38:39,84 --> 0:38:41,36
It's just unheard of.


846
0:38:41,36 --> 0:38:43,12
And so you have an area that's
already been heated


847
0:38:43,12 --> 0:38:44,75
by the sun's rays,


848
0:38:44,75 --> 0:38:47,81
and then you have the aerosol
drift in over that area.


849
0:38:47,81 --> 0:38:49,18
And it's reflecting both ways.


850
0:38:49,18 --> 0:38:50,84
It's reflecting the heat
of the sun back out,


851
0:38:50,84 --> 0:38:52,66
but it's also trapping
the heat


852
0:38:52,66 --> 0:38:55,57
that's already been created
there by the sunlight.


853
0:38:55,57 --> 0:38:59,45
So it will actually create
more heat and trap heat inside


854
0:38:59,45 --> 0:39:0,75
and closer to the atmosphere.


855
0:39:0,75 --> 0:39:4,15
It can actually exacerbate
global warming problems.


856
0:39:4,15 --> 0:39:5,72
And if you become more aware of
what's happening,


857
0:39:5,72 --> 0:39:7,3
where the global
commodities are,


858
0:39:7,3 --> 0:39:20,51
what extreme weather events,
you're one step ahead of them.


859
0:39:20,51 --> 0:39:23,6
The nature of the risk and our
ability to respond to the risk


860
0:39:23,6 --> 0:39:27,3
is much greater in the case
of the scenario


861
0:39:27,3 --> 0:39:28,87
that might involve


862
0:39:28,87 --> 0:39:31,9
large-scale regional
agricultural disruption


863
0:39:31,9 --> 0:39:32,81
lasting a number of years.


864
0:39:32,81 --> 0:39:35,87
So the agenda was drought.


865
0:39:35,87 --> 0:39:38,84
The agenda was
to kill the storm


866
0:39:38,84 --> 0:39:41,6
at least in that one
particular spot.


867
0:39:41,6 --> 0:39:45,0
You see a tremendous and
significant loss of property


868
0:39:45,0 --> 0:39:47,6
and, uh, crop production.


869
0:39:47,6 --> 0:39:51,9
Many times, this will cause
farms to go out of business,


870
0:39:51,9 --> 0:39:53,27
and when farmers
go out of business,


871
0:39:53,27 --> 0:39:54,6
they usually have to sell.


872
0:39:54,6 --> 0:39:56,51
And then if there's somebody
waiting in the wings


873
0:39:56,51 --> 0:40:0,6
to buy their land and then
turn that land over


874
0:40:0,6 --> 0:40:4,42
to the production
of genetically modified crops,


875
0:40:4,42 --> 0:40:6,3
you can see where
there would be


876
0:40:6,3 --> 0:40:8,0
kind of a strategic advantage
there.


877
0:40:8,0 --> 0:40:9,45
There's something that
happened in the Midwest,


878
0:40:9,45 --> 0:40:11,15
and I'm sure everybody's
heard about the flooding


879
0:40:11,15 --> 0:40:12,42
in the Midwest.


880
0:40:12,42 --> 0:40:14,9
And what happened is, um,


881
0:40:14,9 --> 0:40:17,54
George Soros
and his big corporate monolith


882
0:40:17,54 --> 0:40:21,6
went in and started buying up
the farmland.


883
0:40:21,6 --> 0:40:27,6
So not only is it--is it
creating all these stresses,


884
0:40:27,6 --> 0:40:30,72
it appears to be
a corporate land grab.


885
0:40:30,72 --> 0:40:32,27
In other words,
when the farmers,


886
0:40:32,27 --> 0:40:34,75
the small farmers
go out of business,


887
0:40:34,75 --> 0:40:37,81
they're wiped out through these
droughts and everything,


888
0:40:37,81 --> 0:40:40,81
then the big guys come in,
buy up the land.


889
0:40:40,81 --> 0:40:43,39
And if you think
of Western history,


890
0:40:43,39 --> 0:40:45,84
there's a lot of it concerning
water rights


891
0:40:45,84 --> 0:40:47,84
and even water wars.


892
0:40:47,84 --> 0:40:51,39
And so they were shooting
about access to, uh, water,


893
0:40:51,39 --> 0:40:53,78
to water your livestock.


894
0:40:53,78 --> 0:40:55,33
And now people are thinking,


895
0:40:55,33 --> 0:40:57,57
or at least the people who are
involved in weather control


896
0:40:57,57 --> 0:41:1,33
sometimes think
about the river of moisture


897
0:41:1,33 --> 0:41:2,48
above our heads, and,


898
0:41:2,48 --> 0:41:4,33
"Jeez if we could
just tap that."


899
0:41:4,33 --> 0:41:9,0
But that too is a, uh, a water
right that would involve


900
0:41:9,0 --> 0:41:13,69
access to, uh, to people
that felt like maybe they had


901
0:41:13,69 --> 0:41:15,51
prior rights over it.


902
0:41:15,51 --> 0:41:18,36
And you're reducing the food
security of people


903
0:41:18,36 --> 0:41:21,57
through deploying these kinds
of approaches that...


904
0:41:21,57 --> 0:41:24,84
Potentially 2 billion people
could have their food disrupted


905
0:41:24,84 --> 0:41:42,84
by such interventions.


906
0:41:42,84 --> 0:41:54,45
I've been an organic farmer
my entire life...


907
0:41:54,45 --> 0:41:58,36
and I've been, um,
in the last eight years,


908
0:41:58,36 --> 0:42:0,57
been certified organic.


909
0:42:0,57 --> 0:42:5,9
And so I've been growing food
in a way that feels healthy,


910
0:42:5,9 --> 0:42:9,87
where I have the most energy,
and now it's not so healthy.


911
0:42:9,87 --> 0:42:14,39
I want to pass a really nice,
healthy soil,


912
0:42:14,39 --> 0:42:17,15
rich soil earth on
to the children


913
0:42:17,15 --> 0:42:19,45
and have it be fertile.


914
0:42:19,45 --> 0:42:21,6
My name is Joel Gilcoca.


915
0:42:21,6 --> 0:42:32,84
I've been farming on this land
for about five years...


916
0:42:32,84 --> 0:42:39,78
since 2007, and I'm certified
organic since 2001.


917
0:42:39,78 --> 0:42:43,27
Ten years ago, when I started
working for myself,


918
0:42:43,27 --> 0:42:45,21
we can grow cilantro,
no problem.


919
0:42:45,21 --> 0:42:47,81
We can grow basil,
no problem.


920
0:42:47,81 --> 0:42:51,21
We can grow Chinese cabbage
without get trouble


921
0:42:51,21 --> 0:42:53,54
or any vegetable.


922
0:42:53,54 --> 0:42:57,75
But ten years after--I mean,
five years after that,


923
0:42:57,75 --> 0:42:59,33
everything start decline.


924
0:42:59,33 --> 0:43:0,75
Could you add
something to the environment


925
0:43:0,75 --> 0:43:2,3
that would affect
a large population?


926
0:43:2,3 --> 0:43:3,69
The answer is absolutely yes.


927
0:43:3,69 --> 0:43:7,6
I started seeing chemtrails
being laid overhead


928
0:43:7,6 --> 0:43:8,45
more frequently


929
0:43:8,45 --> 0:43:10,36
and noticing the change
in the crop production.


930
0:43:10,36 --> 0:43:12,57
What we see in our area


931
0:43:12,57 --> 0:43:14,33
anytime there's
convective clouds,


932
0:43:14,33 --> 0:43:16,69
anytime there's
a large cumulus cloud forming


933
0:43:16,69 --> 0:43:18,81
and beginning to rise,


934
0:43:18,81 --> 0:43:20,6
we hear aircraft
in the vicinity.


935
0:43:20,6 --> 0:43:23,6
We see them actually flying over
these convecting clouds,


936
0:43:23,6 --> 0:43:25,69
and then in a very short time,


937
0:43:25,69 --> 0:43:28,78
before those clouds generally
will drop any precipitation,


938
0:43:28,78 --> 0:43:31,81
we'll see the entire cloud
more or less dissolve


939
0:43:31,81 --> 0:43:34,72
into what looks like
a massive smoke bank.


940
0:43:34,72 --> 0:43:36,87
If you can control
the weather,


941
0:43:36,87 --> 0:43:40,45
then you can control
where the rain falls


942
0:43:40,45 --> 0:43:42,24
or where it doesn't fall.


943
0:43:42,24 --> 0:43:43,51
And if you can do that,


944
0:43:43,51 --> 0:43:45,78
then you can control
whose crops survive


945
0:43:45,78 --> 0:43:48,48
and whose crops thrive.


946
0:43:48,48 --> 0:43:54,0
And if you happen to be
favoring, um, a corporation


947
0:43:54,0 --> 0:43:57,51
or a group of corporations that
are flooding the market


948
0:43:57,51 --> 0:44:0,54
with genetically
modified crops,


949
0:44:0,54 --> 0:44:4,6
you can see how
manipulating the weather


950
0:44:4,6 --> 0:44:7,42
can actually change
the market share


951
0:44:7,42 --> 0:44:10,48
that one or more
corporations have.


952
0:44:10,48 --> 0:44:13,69
Um, and there's, you know,


953
0:44:13,69 --> 0:44:15,66
there's lots of different ways
that you can do it.


954
0:44:15,66 --> 0:44:18,81
You can do it
by denying precipitation


955
0:44:18,81 --> 0:44:20,6
or by giving too much.


956
0:44:20,6 --> 0:44:23,36
You can cause, uh, you know,


957
0:44:23,36 --> 0:44:25,63
unusually large hailstones
to come out of the sky


958
0:44:25,63 --> 0:44:28,69
and completely obliterate
a crop of corn.


959
0:44:28,69 --> 0:44:31,3
There's lots of different ways
that you can do it.


960
0:44:31,3 --> 0:44:35,63
Um, you know, tornadoes,
rip up an entire town,


961
0:44:35,63 --> 0:44:38,36
like Joplin, Missouri,
I think it was.


962
0:44:38,36 --> 0:44:42,24
If you look back at the tapes
of those weather systems,


963
0:44:42,24 --> 0:44:45,0
and you look five days
prior to that,


964
0:44:45,0 --> 0:44:49,6
you'll see that in those days
preceding those events,


965
0:44:49,6 --> 0:44:51,57
there was all kinds of aerosols
being sprayed


966
0:44:51,57 --> 0:44:53,72
all along the California
coastline,


967
0:44:53,72 --> 0:44:56,21
where the moisture
for those storms came from,


968
0:44:56,21 --> 0:44:58,72
where those storm systems
originated.


969
0:44:58,72 --> 0:45:0,48
You know, it's--
I mean, it's insidious,


970
0:45:0,48 --> 0:45:1,81
when you think about it.


971
0:45:1,81 --> 0:45:4,72
Oh, my God, I've seen,
since the chemtrails have come,


972
0:45:4,72 --> 0:45:8,72
there's a direct correlation
with the way the health--


973
0:45:8,72 --> 0:45:11,6
The food doesn't look
as healthy and vibrant,


974
0:45:11,6 --> 0:45:13,75
and less of it.


975
0:45:13,75 --> 0:45:15,48
And that concerns me.


976
0:45:15,48 --> 0:45:18,21
And of course, all crop losses
are related


977
0:45:18,21 --> 0:45:20,66
to weather modification
problems.


978
0:45:20,66 --> 0:45:23,63
Either climate,
uh, worldwide weather,


979
0:45:23,63 --> 0:45:29,54
or local weather, which is
called micro-climates.


980
0:45:29,54 --> 0:45:33,18
And these micro-climates
definitely determine


981
0:45:33,18 --> 0:45:36,36
what crop grows where
and in which community.


982
0:45:36,36 --> 0:45:39,18
And so, therefore,
without stable micro-climates,


983
0:45:39,18 --> 0:45:41,84
we can not produce
as much food


984
0:45:41,84 --> 0:45:44,18
for the rest of the world
and ourselves


985
0:45:44,18 --> 0:45:46,84
as when we have
more stable micro-climates,


986
0:45:46,84 --> 0:45:49,75
not only in the United States,
but in other countries as well.


987
0:45:49,75 --> 0:45:51,39
We fertilize it
really good,


988
0:45:51,39 --> 0:45:55,9
and they still have a lot
of trouble to produce.


989
0:45:55,9 --> 0:45:56,36
And I think this is not fun,


990
0:45:56,36 --> 0:45:59,48
because we losing
a lot of money


991
0:45:59,48 --> 0:46:3,18
put them into this kind
of production.


992
0:46:3,18 --> 0:46:8,12
In 2008, 2009, three times
I losted my complete planting


993
0:46:8,12 --> 0:46:9,63
of Chinese cabbage.


994
0:46:9,63 --> 0:46:11,57
Weather events is one
of the key components


995
0:46:11,57 --> 0:46:13,72
to most, uh, commodities
that are traded.


996
0:46:13,72 --> 0:46:18,12
Let's just say your agricultural
group--corn, soybeans, wheat,


997
0:46:18,12 --> 0:46:19,45
something along those lines,


998
0:46:19,45 --> 0:46:24,33
weather is by far the largest,
uh, affecting factor


999
0:46:24,33 --> 0:46:26,78
in the price of those
commodities.


1000
0:46:26,78 --> 0:46:29,63
If one farmer's crop fails,


1001
0:46:29,63 --> 0:46:33,3
we have a major crop failure,
say, in corn,


1002
0:46:33,3 --> 0:46:36,15
now that's going to affect
every other company


1003
0:46:36,15 --> 0:46:38,63
that uses corn
in their manufacturing process.


1004
0:46:38,63 --> 0:46:39,84
There's gonna be less of it.


1005
0:46:39,84 --> 0:46:42,42
And anytime there is less
of something,


1006
0:46:42,42 --> 0:46:44,66
that creates a price rise.


1007
0:46:44,66 --> 0:46:46,33
Demand rises.
Okay?


1008
0:46:46,33 --> 0:46:47,78
Because there isn't any of it.


1009
0:46:47,78 --> 0:46:49,3
There's only one thing.


1010
0:46:49,3 --> 0:46:50,72
You've got five people
that want it.


1011
0:46:50,72 --> 0:46:53,39
So they're gonna pay
more money for it.


1012
0:46:53,39 --> 0:46:54,63
The companies know that.


1013
0:46:54,63 --> 0:46:56,87
So they're gonna
hike the prices up anyway.


1014
0:46:56,87 --> 0:46:58,63
The consumer actually sees
the big brunt end


1015
0:46:58,63 --> 0:47:2,12
of the higher, you know,
cost in the commodity


1016
0:47:2,12 --> 0:47:3,69
due to the adverse
weather condition.


1017
0:47:3,69 --> 0:47:5,69
Obviously, the consumer will pay
that price.


1018
0:47:5,69 --> 0:47:9,66
I've noticed that the rainfall
is less predictable,


1019
0:47:9,66 --> 0:47:11,42
and then, when it does rain,


1020
0:47:11,42 --> 0:47:15,69
it does rain periods of time
that's more,


1021
0:47:15,69 --> 0:47:18,3
more, like, longer periods.


1022
0:47:18,3 --> 0:47:22,18
So not only do we have
the pollution,


1023
0:47:22,18 --> 0:47:25,45
not only do we have
stunted growth,


1024
0:47:25,45 --> 0:47:28,75
but we also have changes
in weather.


1025
0:47:28,75 --> 0:47:30,33
And there's been
severe changes in weather


1026
0:47:30,33 --> 0:47:31,87
all across the globe.


1027
0:47:31,87 --> 0:47:33,72
I don't have a clue
how bad they are,


1028
0:47:33,72 --> 0:47:36,24
but I know they are affecting
already in the--


1029
0:47:36,24 --> 0:47:39,72
in certain plants, you know,
like basil, cilantro,


1030
0:47:39,72 --> 0:47:44,21
and sometime the broccoli
get too much, uh, fungus.


1031
0:47:44,21 --> 0:47:47,15
It can be from those thing
because, um,


1032
0:47:47,15 --> 0:47:50,0
no matter what we do,
it doesn't fit.


1033
0:47:50,0 --> 0:47:51,72
It not working right.


1034
0:47:51,72 --> 0:47:54,36
It appears to be a fungally
related ailment.


1035
0:47:54,36 --> 0:47:57,57
And if one looks at
the species extinction rate,


1036
0:47:57,57 --> 0:48:0,9
which today
is estimated to be


1037
0:48:0,9 --> 0:48:2,75
1,000 times
natural variability,


1038
0:48:2,75 --> 0:48:4,81
that's 1,000 times normal,


1039
0:48:4,81 --> 0:48:7,81
a figure you'd think would
alarm most reasonable people,


1040
0:48:7,81 --> 0:48:9,75
which is 100,000% of normal,


1041
0:48:9,75 --> 0:48:12,33
and 70% to 80%
of that extinction,


1042
0:48:12,33 --> 0:48:16,24
plant and animal,
is related to fungal infection.


1043
0:48:16,24 --> 0:48:19,87
Geoengineering particulates
are known to proliferate


1044
0:48:19,87 --> 0:48:21,27
fungal reproduction.


1045
0:48:21,27 --> 0:48:26,54
Abiotic stresses are drought,
cold, heavy metals,


1046
0:48:26,54 --> 0:48:29,36
excess moisture in the soil,


1047
0:48:29,36 --> 0:48:33,69
and Monsanto has a patent
that actually addresses


1048
0:48:33,69 --> 0:48:35,78
all of those
abiotic stresses.


1049
0:48:35,78 --> 0:48:38,78
And the plants
that it addresses


1050
0:48:38,78 --> 0:48:40,81
is everything from apples
to zucchini.


1051
0:48:40,81 --> 0:48:44,45
2011 was one
of the worst years


1052
0:48:44,45 --> 0:48:46,87
for things that create
abiotic stress.


1053
0:48:46,87 --> 0:48:53,36
They had 12 worldwide
severe weather problems.


1054
0:48:53,36 --> 0:48:56,6
This destroyed a good portion
of the food supply.


1055
0:48:56,6 --> 0:48:58,66
Now I'm having a hard time
growing cherry tomatoes outside


1056
0:48:58,66 --> 0:49:0,66
under these conditions,


1057
0:49:0,66 --> 0:49:4,63
and I've turned to having
to build a greenhouse,


1058
0:49:4,63 --> 0:49:9,21
where I'm now growing large
tomatoes, heirlooms.


1059
0:49:9,21 --> 0:49:13,9
And they are producing
really nice, big tomatoes.


1060
0:49:13,9 --> 0:49:18,9
I see that the tomatoes that I
planted now are really healthy,


1061
0:49:18,9 --> 0:49:20,57
and the ones outside
are dying.


1062
0:49:20,57 --> 0:49:25,0
The Midwest grows 40%
of the world's corn.


1063
0:49:25,0 --> 0:49:26,57
And it does have a tendency
to flood,


1064
0:49:26,57 --> 0:49:29,33
so we can expect
more and more flooding,


1065
0:49:29,33 --> 0:49:30,66
according to the statistics.


1066
0:49:30,66 --> 0:49:32,66
The E.P.A. statistics say
that there's going to be


1067
0:49:32,66 --> 0:49:34,27
more and more flooding.


1068
0:49:34,27 --> 0:49:46,21
Monsanto is one of the world's
largest chemical companies.


1069
0:49:46,21 --> 0:49:50,84
They also own 90%
of the seed companies


1070
0:49:50,84 --> 0:49:52,54
in the world right now,


1071
0:49:52,54 --> 0:49:56,36
and they
are the largest company


1072
0:49:56,36 --> 0:49:59,3
putting out
genetically modified seeds.


1073
0:49:59,3 --> 0:50:0,45
So what does Monsanto do?


1074
0:50:0,45 --> 0:50:5,6
Corn is the lead-in because corn
is in just about everything.


1075
0:50:5,6 --> 0:50:7,45
Corn is the main crop,


1076
0:50:7,45 --> 0:50:9,87
and Monsanto leads in
with corn products


1077
0:50:9,87 --> 0:50:11,66
before it does anything else.


1078
0:50:11,66 --> 0:50:14,33
So what we have is
Monsanto leading in


1079
0:50:14,33 --> 0:50:16,72
with a drought-resistant corn


1080
0:50:16,72 --> 0:50:19,36
and an abiotic-stress-
resistant corn.


1081
0:50:19,36 --> 0:50:21,63
The drought and the flooding,
it's all the same patent.


1082
0:50:21,63 --> 0:50:25,45
Monsanto has a patent
for abiotic stress.


1083
0:50:25,45 --> 0:50:27,81
Abiotic stress is the drought.


1084
0:50:27,81 --> 0:50:29,81
It's the flooding.
It's the excess soil.


1085
0:50:29,81 --> 0:50:32,42
It's anything that's going
to stress a plant.


1086
0:50:32,42 --> 0:50:35,45
G.M.O. is
Genetically Modified Organism,


1087
0:50:35,45 --> 0:50:39,3
and it's also called G.E.,
Genetic Engineering.


1088
0:50:39,3 --> 0:50:41,21
Well, the history
of farming has been,


1089
0:50:41,21 --> 0:50:43,78
a farmer will plant a seed
into the ground,


1090
0:50:43,78 --> 0:50:45,42
and there will be nutrients
in the ground


1091
0:50:45,42 --> 0:50:48,3
that will enable that plant
to grow,


1092
0:50:48,3 --> 0:50:50,33
and then at the end
of the growing season,


1093
0:50:50,33 --> 0:50:51,84
they will take
some of the seeds,


1094
0:50:51,84 --> 0:50:54,6
and they will save them
for next year,


1095
0:50:54,6 --> 0:50:56,18
and they'll grow
their next crop.


1096
0:50:56,18 --> 0:50:59,3
But what is going on with
the genetically modified seeds


1097
0:50:59,3 --> 0:51:1,9
is they're what's called
terminator seeds.


1098
0:51:1,9 --> 0:51:6,12
A terminator seed will not
produce other seeds.


1099
0:51:6,12 --> 0:51:8,3
With the terminator seeds,


1100
0:51:8,3 --> 0:51:12,63
these farmers have to go back
to Monsanto every single year


1101
0:51:12,63 --> 0:51:15,66
and purchase these extremely
high-priced seeds.


1102
0:51:15,66 --> 0:51:19,69
There have been studies
outside of the United States


1103
0:51:19,69 --> 0:51:23,33
showing that genetically
modified seeds,


1104
0:51:23,33 --> 0:51:25,51
the plants that come
from them,


1105
0:51:25,51 --> 0:51:30,3
are extremely harmful to humans
and other life on this planet.


1106
0:51:30,3 --> 0:51:32,33
Uh, when I started farming,


1107
0:51:32,33 --> 0:51:34,75
I produce 100% my crops.


1108
0:51:34,75 --> 0:51:37,54
But in the last four years,


1109
0:51:37,54 --> 0:51:41,39
I've been declined
to 50%, 75%


1110
0:51:41,39 --> 0:51:43,78
if I took into later crop,


1111
0:51:43,78 --> 0:51:46,0
because I've been lost
everything.


1112
0:51:46,0 --> 0:51:48,15
And that's why I start moving
all different crop,


1113
0:51:48,15 --> 0:51:50,39
so I can cover the loss.


1114
0:51:50,39 --> 0:51:55,21
Well, my food production
has declined at least by 60%


1115
0:51:55,21 --> 0:51:58,6
in the last, I don't know,
ten years.


1116
0:51:58,6 --> 0:52:1,57
I've noticed banana stalks
are smaller,


1117
0:52:1,57 --> 0:52:5,21
and certainly the tomatoes--
I'm hardly getting any.


1118
0:52:5,21 --> 0:52:7,63
I use to get bushels
of tomatoes,


1119
0:52:7,63 --> 0:52:10,72
and now I can barely
get a bowl.


1120
0:52:10,72 --> 0:52:13,45
My concern--it can be,
you know.


1121
0:52:13,45 --> 0:52:15,24
It's possible if they go-


1122
0:52:15,24 --> 0:52:18,63
we go and run out of business
if they continue doing that.


1123
0:52:18,63 --> 0:52:20,81
They really need to stop
they're doing.


1124
0:52:20,81 --> 0:52:22,63
That's all I believe,


1125
0:52:22,63 --> 0:52:25,48
because we cannot change
the system, you know,


1126
0:52:25,48 --> 0:52:26,81
the Mother Nature.


1127
0:52:26,81 --> 0:52:30,24
We have to keep going
the way it is.


1128
0:52:30,24 --> 0:52:31,45
It's not possible.


1129
0:52:31,45 --> 0:52:33,0
On the other hand, the,
you know,


1130
0:52:33,0 --> 0:52:36,15
heat stress is going to be
one of the things,


1131
0:52:36,15 --> 0:52:37,27
or thought to be
one of the things


1132
0:52:37,27 --> 0:52:39,69
that might limit production
of crops


1133
0:52:39,69 --> 0:52:40,87
throughout the tropics.


1134
0:52:40,87 --> 0:52:43,78
And so there are some questions
of tradeoffs,


1135
0:52:43,78 --> 0:52:45,36
of, you know, when--


1136
0:52:45,36 --> 0:52:47,39
if you think you're gonna
benefit many people


1137
0:52:47,39 --> 0:52:48,75
and harm some people,


1138
0:52:48,75 --> 0:52:54,6
how do you deal with this
issue of equity, and what--


1139
0:52:54,6 --> 0:52:58,0
I mean, what are the options
for dealing with that?


1140
0:52:58,0 --> 0:53:0,27
A really interesting thing that
I've found


1141
0:53:0,27 --> 0:53:2,54
is that the E.P.A.
has concluded


1142
0:53:2,54 --> 0:53:5,57
that incidents
of heat stress,


1143
0:53:5,57 --> 0:53:11,21
drought, flooding, cold,
any type of abiotic stress


1144
0:53:11,21 --> 0:53:13,15
is on the increase.


1145
0:53:13,15 --> 0:53:18,78
And loss due to that
is going to double by 2030.


1146
0:53:18,78 --> 0:53:22,84
Then you put yourself up
as the solution.


1147
0:53:22,84 --> 0:53:27,12
So when all of this weather
comes and wipes you out,


1148
0:53:27,12 --> 0:53:28,78
or you have
a drought problem,


1149
0:53:28,78 --> 0:53:32,21
"Oh, drought?
We've got the seed for you.


1150
0:53:32,21 --> 0:53:35,66
"Here is our drought-tolerant
corn, just for you,


1151
0:53:35,66 --> 0:53:37,33
"and it'll solve
your problems.


1152
0:53:37,33 --> 0:53:41,78
"Oh, by the way, you have
to sign this agreement,


1153
0:53:41,78 --> 0:53:44,63
"this 40-page agreement,


1154
0:53:44,63 --> 0:53:49,6
"so that when you go ahead
and plant these seeds,


1155
0:53:49,6 --> 0:53:51,42
you now belong to Monsanto."


1156
0:53:51,42 --> 0:53:54,66
The weather disasters seem
to be directly correlated


1157
0:53:54,66 --> 0:53:57,63
to an increase
in Monsanto's sales.


1158
0:53:57,63 --> 0:54:0,54
So there will be the have
and the have-nots.


1159
0:54:0,54 --> 0:54:2,48
And one of the things
that's being discussed


1160
0:54:2,48 --> 0:54:4,27
under global geoengineering


1161
0:54:4,27 --> 0:54:5,78
is which countries
will be the haves


1162
0:54:5,78 --> 0:54:8,51
and which countries
will be the have-nots


1163
0:54:8,51 --> 0:54:12,66
when that type of climate
remediation is undertaken


1164
0:54:12,66 --> 0:54:16,21
by many people
at a certain level,


1165
0:54:16,21 --> 0:54:19,27
mostly private corporations
funded by the U.S. government,


1166
0:54:19,27 --> 0:54:20,84
they are hoping.


1167
0:54:20,84 --> 0:54:23,24
The fact that it's cheap isn't
necessarily a good thing at all.


1168
0:54:23,24 --> 0:54:25,45
As I'll come to in a second,
the fact that it's cheap


1169
0:54:25,45 --> 0:54:27,72
is part of the hard problem
of governance.


1170
0:54:27,72 --> 0:54:29,78
The fact that it's cheap means
any small state


1171
0:54:29,78 --> 0:54:32,48
or even, conceivably,
individuals could do this.


1172
0:54:32,48 --> 0:54:34,57
And that is
a very dangerous thing.


1173
0:54:34,57 --> 0:54:37,75
There's only probably
under $10 million per year,


1174
0:54:37,75 --> 0:54:39,42
and maybe far less than that,


1175
0:54:39,42 --> 0:54:41,48
being spent
on geoengineering research.


1176
0:54:41,48 --> 0:54:45,6
Um, it's a mix of a handful
of government grants


1177
0:54:45,6 --> 0:54:47,27
and some private money,


1178
0:54:47,27 --> 0:54:50,18
including support
from Bill Gates.


1179
0:54:50,18 --> 0:54:52,33
Bill Gates invests
in geoengineering.


1180
0:54:52,33 --> 0:54:54,84
Geoengineering destroys crops.


1181
0:54:54,84 --> 0:54:59,0
Monsanto supplies the seed
to replace those crops.


1182
0:54:59,0 --> 0:55:1,75
Bill Gates invests in Monsanto,


1183
0:55:1,75 --> 0:55:4,75
so Bill Gates makes
a ton of money,


1184
0:55:4,75 --> 0:55:6,63
Monsanto makes a ton of money,


1185
0:55:6,63 --> 0:55:9,18
and the small farmer
gets squashed.


1186
0:55:9,18 --> 0:55:10,66
Corn prices go higher


1187
0:55:10,66 --> 0:55:13,33
because of a severe drought
in this country,


1188
0:55:13,33 --> 0:55:15,78
um, you know, where 41%
of the country--


1189
0:55:15,78 --> 0:55:18,0
the world's supply
of corn comes from.


1190
0:55:18,0 --> 0:55:20,42
So corn prices are higher.
The farmer has more money.


1191
0:55:20,42 --> 0:55:21,66
So what does he do?


1192
0:55:21,66 --> 0:55:25,39
He buys fertilizers,
which dries up the mosaic stock,


1193
0:55:25,39 --> 0:55:27,63
and--or he could purchase


1194
0:55:27,63 --> 0:55:30,57
genetically modified seeds
from Monsanto.


1195
0:55:30,57 --> 0:55:33,39
You've got severe,
severe drought in Africa.


1196
0:55:33,39 --> 0:55:36,12
In 2011, there was
a severe drought.


1197
0:55:36,12 --> 0:55:38,3
This is causing nothing
but death.


1198
0:55:38,3 --> 0:55:41,87
It's causing starvation.
It's causing malnutrition.


1199
0:55:41,87 --> 0:55:44,0
It's causing
a severe water shortage.


1200
0:55:44,0 --> 0:55:46,9
How do you grow anything
without water?


1201
0:55:46,9 --> 0:55:50,0
You cannot grow anything
without water.


1202
0:55:50,0 --> 0:55:52,3
So what does Monsanto do?


1203
0:55:52,3 --> 0:55:57,42
They say, "Oh, we got a
drought-tolerant corn for you."


1204
0:55:57,42 --> 0:56:0,48
There's been
an excessive push


1205
0:56:0,48 --> 0:56:3,27
to get bioengineered crops
into Africa.


1206
0:56:3,27 --> 0:56:7,48
They look at severe conditions
as an opportunity.


1207
0:56:7,48 --> 0:56:10,57
They're disaster capitalists.


1208
0:56:10,57 --> 0:56:13,66
So here you have farmers,
and they've got flooding,


1209
0:56:13,66 --> 0:56:15,27
they've got droughts,


1210
0:56:15,27 --> 0:56:17,15
they've got everything that
totally wipes them out.


1211
0:56:17,15 --> 0:56:18,48
So what happens?


1212
0:56:18,48 --> 0:56:20,6
Okay, they--if they plant it
early enough in the year,


1213
0:56:20,6 --> 0:56:22,42
they can go ahead
and try and plant again.


1214
0:56:22,42 --> 0:56:24,3
So buy more seed.


1215
0:56:24,3 --> 0:56:25,75
Okay?
Buy Monsanto seed.


1216
0:56:25,75 --> 0:56:29,3
So they're just raking up
on that end of it. Okay?


1217
0:56:29,3 --> 0:56:31,57
So if you can create enough
weather manipulation,


1218
0:56:31,57 --> 0:56:34,15
you can shorten
growing seasons,


1219
0:56:34,15 --> 0:56:37,39
you can create enough
of that disaster,


1220
0:56:37,39 --> 0:56:40,15
and you've got
the seed supply,


1221
0:56:40,15 --> 0:56:48,36
they've got to come to you.


1222
0:56:48,36 --> 0:56:49,75
Geoengineers have stated
on the record


1223
0:56:49,75 --> 0:56:51,84
that if global geoengineering
were started,


1224
0:56:51,84 --> 0:56:55,24
it could cause droughts
in Asia and Africa.


1225
0:56:55,24 --> 0:56:56,72
And they state that
to the American public


1226
0:56:56,72 --> 0:56:58,72
for probably obvious reasons.


1227
0:56:58,72 --> 0:57:0,27
Why would they tell
the American public


1228
0:57:0,27 --> 0:57:2,18
that it could also cause
droughts here?


1229
0:57:2,18 --> 0:57:4,51
Why wouldn't it cause
droughts here?


1230
0:57:4,51 --> 0:57:6,75
There's nothing special
about America


1231
0:57:6,75 --> 0:57:9,6
and the geography here


1232
0:57:9,6 --> 0:57:11,6
that would not have the same
effect as Asia and Africa.


1233
0:57:11,6 --> 0:57:14,18
If the atmosphere is filled
with particulates,


1234
0:57:14,18 --> 0:57:18,9
those particulates diminish
and disperse rainfall, period.


1235
0:57:18,9 --> 0:57:20,51
There's too many
condensation nuclei,


1236
0:57:20,51 --> 0:57:23,3
so the water droplets do not
combine and fall as rain.


1237
0:57:23,3 --> 0:57:26,87
They simply adhere to those tiny
particles and migrate further.


1238
0:57:26,87 --> 0:57:29,0
And that's exactly
what we see.


1239
0:57:29,0 --> 0:57:33,66
One of the suggestions
about geoengineering has been


1240
0:57:33,66 --> 0:57:37,42
that we genetically modify
trees and plants,


1241
0:57:37,42 --> 0:57:41,57
um, we genetically modify crops
to be aluminum resistant,


1242
0:57:41,57 --> 0:57:44,54
and this is ongoing
at this time.


1243
0:57:44,54 --> 0:57:47,39
And part of the geoengineering
scheme is to say,


1244
0:57:47,39 --> 0:57:49,15
"We're gonna put all these
chemicals and particles


1245
0:57:49,15 --> 0:57:50,63
"into our atmosphere,


1246
0:57:50,63 --> 0:57:53,63
"which is going to cause
air pollution, water pollution,


1247
0:57:53,63 --> 0:57:55,21
"changes in soil pH,


1248
0:57:55,21 --> 0:57:57,66
"and could disrupt agriculture
crop production


1249
0:57:57,66 --> 0:57:59,51
to a great degree."


1250
0:57:59,51 --> 0:58:2,15
So, therefore, instead of
saying that maybe this isn't


1251
0:58:2,15 --> 0:58:4,78
a good idea that we pollute
our air, water, and soils


1252
0:58:4,78 --> 0:58:7,39
with the chemicals we're gonna
put into the atmosphere,


1253
0:58:7,39 --> 0:58:9,42
which do come back down,


1254
0:58:9,42 --> 0:58:12,51
there's a scheme abounding
which is happening right now


1255
0:58:12,51 --> 0:58:16,0
to modify some crops so that
they are aluminum resistant


1256
0:58:16,0 --> 0:58:18,54
to the types of chemicals
and particles


1257
0:58:18,54 --> 0:58:20,66
they're gonna put
into the atmosphere.


1258
0:58:20,66 --> 0:58:22,39
It's just gonna get worse
until the point


1259
0:58:22,39 --> 0:58:24,15
where we're not gonna able
to grow anything at all


1260
0:58:24,15 --> 0:58:28,12
unless it's a Monsanto
genetically modified,


1261
0:58:28,12 --> 0:58:31,57
abiotic-stress-resistant seed.


1262
0:58:31,57 --> 0:58:35,12
The chemical companies
and the genet--and Monsanto


1263
0:58:35,12 --> 0:58:37,63
and all of these companies
are working together


1264
0:58:37,63 --> 0:58:40,81
to make us totally dependent
on their products


1265
0:58:40,81 --> 0:58:43,18
for growing corn
or growing any kind


1266
0:58:43,18 --> 0:58:45,6
of agricultural product
or trees, whatever.


1267
0:58:45,6 --> 0:58:50,9
We're going to corporatize not
only where the rainfall goes


1268
0:58:50,9 --> 0:58:51,75
and who gets it


1269
0:58:51,75 --> 0:58:54,81
through geoengineering and
weather modification schemes,


1270
0:58:54,81 --> 0:58:57,21
but we're also going to say
that these are gonna be


1271
0:58:57,21 --> 0:58:58,69
the only crops
that are gonna grow


1272
0:58:58,69 --> 0:59:2,0
in areas where we're putting in
toxic chemicals


1273
0:59:2,0 --> 0:59:4,3
that are coming down
and altering the soils.


1274
0:59:4,3 --> 0:59:7,66
One of the most basic things
about human society


1275
0:59:7,66 --> 0:59:10,69
is that we need
food and water.


1276
0:59:10,69 --> 0:59:17,33
And these are two
of the things that, uh,


1277
0:59:17,33 --> 0:59:21,48
are most severely dependent
upon good weather--


1278
0:59:21,48 --> 0:59:23,24
rain at the right time
of the year,


1279
0:59:23,24 --> 0:59:24,81
sunshine so crops can grow.


1280
0:59:24,81 --> 0:59:27,18
Not enough sunshine,
and they don't grow.


1281
0:59:27,18 --> 0:59:29,3
Too much water,
the plants die.


1282
0:59:29,3 --> 0:59:31,18
Not enough water,
the plants die.


1283
0:59:31,18 --> 0:59:32,51
All of this goes back


1284
0:59:32,51 --> 0:59:35,18
to the amount of food
that's available.


1285
0:59:35,18 --> 0:59:42,48
So if you starve people,
they will be vulnerable.


1286
0:59:42,48 --> 0:59:46,6
They will be much easier
to manipulate and force to do


1287
0:59:46,6 --> 0:59:49,33
whatever the government
wants them to do.


1288
0:59:49,33 --> 0:59:54,3
So if you control how much food
there is or its availability


1289
0:59:54,3 --> 0:59:56,21
through things
like the weather


1290
0:59:56,21 --> 1:0:1,6
or using the weather as
a strategic tool, militarily,


1291
1:0:1,6 --> 1:0:5,48
um, you can, you know,
dramatically influence


1292
1:0:5,48 --> 1:0:7,18
what's going on
in the country.


1293
1:0:7,18 --> 1:0:11,54
And by doing that
over and over again


1294
1:0:11,54 --> 1:0:14,87
sequentially
through a region, um,


1295
1:0:14,87 --> 1:0:18,87
it's possible that you can
change the, um,


1296
1:0:18,87 --> 1:0:22,15
the political spectrum
over an entire region


1297
1:0:22,15 --> 1:0:24,24
by doing this
over and over again.


1298
1:0:24,24 --> 1:0:26,24
Um, maybe even, you know,


1299
1:0:26,24 --> 1:0:28,3
do it over
a much wider region.


1300
1:0:28,3 --> 1:0:31,15
Create so much instability
that you're able to, you know,


1301
1:0:31,15 --> 1:0:33,18
come in and say, "Oh, we have
these wonderful,


1302
1:0:33,18 --> 1:0:35,75
"fast-growing crops, you know,
genetically modified.


1303
1:0:35,75 --> 1:0:37,69
"And you know, this--
you'll have--


1304
1:0:37,69 --> 1:0:40,36
you'll have something to eat
in less than three weeks."


1305
1:0:40,36 --> 1:0:44,84
You know, um, and I imagine
that, uh, you know,


1306
1:0:44,84 --> 1:0:47,63
if you can control
the food supply,


1307
1:0:47,63 --> 1:0:50,39
that you can then consolidate
the financial


1308
1:0:50,39 --> 1:0:53,12
and the political interests
of a country.


1309
1:0:53,12 --> 1:0:57,72
Could predicting the weather
enable a group


1310
1:0:57,72 --> 1:1:3,0
or a specific entity
to profit from that knowledge


1311
1:1:3,0 --> 1:1:5,33
of knowing what type of weather
or weather pattern will be?


1312
1:1:5,33 --> 1:1:6,57
Absolutely.


1313
1:1:6,57 --> 1:1:8,0
That's what all commodities
are driven by.


1314
1:1:8,0 --> 1:1:10,3
They're driven by predicting
the weather,


1315
1:1:10,3 --> 1:1:12,51
how the weather will be
in a certain location,


1316
1:1:12,51 --> 1:1:14,15
and that directly
is correlated


1317
1:1:14,15 --> 1:1:15,42
to the price
of that commodity.


1318
1:1:15,42 --> 1:1:32,87
Absolutely.
There's no doubt.


1319
1:1:32,87 --> 1:1:35,33
While there are a number
of agendas associated


1320
1:1:35,33 --> 1:1:37,3
with these damaging programs,


1321
1:1:37,3 --> 1:1:38,54
one thing is for sure:


1322
1:1:38,54 --> 1:1:41,0
They can be used
to control our weather


1323
1:1:41,0 --> 1:1:44,57
and thus corporatize every
natural system on the planet.


1324
1:1:44,57 --> 1:1:47,63
This enables certain
individuals to consolidate


1325
1:1:47,63 --> 1:1:51,18
an enormous amount of both
monetary and political power


1326
1:1:51,18 --> 1:1:52,84
into the hands of a few,


1327
1:1:52,84 --> 1:1:57,6
at the expense of every
living thing on the planet.


1328
1:1:57,6 --> 1:1:59,69
Just by definition,
the geoengineering programs


1329
1:1:59,69 --> 1:2:1,51
are a direct assault


1330
1:2:1,51 --> 1:2:3,75
on the most elemental aspects
of nature.


1331
1:2:3,75 --> 1:2:6,84
What we're doing
when we modify the weather


1332
1:2:6,84 --> 1:2:9,45
is we're changing
the world's climate,


1333
1:2:9,45 --> 1:2:11,81
and we're changing
the micro-climates.


1334
1:2:11,81 --> 1:2:13,39
And we are doing it.


1335
1:2:13,39 --> 1:2:15,3
There are things we can say
for certain.


1336
1:2:15,3 --> 1:2:16,72
There's a mountain
of metal raining down on us.


1337
1:2:16,72 --> 1:2:19,39
We're certainly breathing
that metal.


1338
1:2:19,39 --> 1:2:22,6
We have documented
from the computer modeling


1339
1:2:22,6 --> 1:2:24,36
some unintended consequences.


1340
1:2:24,36 --> 1:2:26,24
If such a contamination
is present,


1341
1:2:26,24 --> 1:2:27,39
shouldn't we investigate?


1342
1:2:27,39 --> 1:2:28,75
Shouldn't local agencies
investigate,


1343
1:2:28,75 --> 1:2:30,42
which they have
patently refused to do?


1344
1:2:30,42 --> 1:2:33,15
There's no question that
large-scale climate engineering


1345
1:2:33,15 --> 1:2:35,12
is untested and dangerous.


1346
1:2:35,12 --> 1:2:38,0
I would disagree quite
strongly that it is--


1347
1:2:38,0 --> 1:2:39,57
um, doesn't exist.


1348
1:2:39,57 --> 1:2:42,6
I think that the capacity to do
it in engineering terms


1349
1:2:42,6 --> 1:2:44,6
most certainly exists,
and that's part of the reason


1350
1:2:44,6 --> 1:2:47,36
we have to think seriously
about how we manage that.


1351
1:2:47,36 --> 1:2:49,9
We are breathing a mountain
of metal,


1352
1:2:49,9 --> 1:2:50,45
and that can't be denied.


1353
1:2:50,45 --> 1:2:51,78
If geoengineering continues,


1354
1:2:51,78 --> 1:2:53,3
and the weather manipulation
continues,


1355
1:2:53,3 --> 1:2:56,84
and genetic modification
continues overtaking,


1356
1:2:56,84 --> 1:2:59,51
we're going to lose
our ability to grow


1357
1:2:59,51 --> 1:3:1,12
good, nutritious food.


1358
1:3:1,12 --> 1:3:4,9
We are going to lose
our ability to thrive.


1359
1:3:4,9 --> 1:3:7,48
I personally consider this
ongoing toxic dumping


1360
1:3:7,48 --> 1:3:11,6
into our atmosphere to be,
along with nuclear radiation,


1361
1:3:11,6 --> 1:3:14,18
the most dangerous threats
to our health


1362
1:3:14,18 --> 1:3:15,6
and to our environment.


1363
1:3:15,6 --> 1:3:18,9
We've seen UV scales
go off the charts,


1364
1:3:18,9 --> 1:3:20,36
which are a known consequence
of geoengineering,


1365
1:3:20,36 --> 1:3:21,69
ozone destruction.


1366
1:3:21,69 --> 1:3:23,75
We've seen rainfall patterns
disrupted in ways


1367
1:3:23,75 --> 1:3:25,18
that meteorologists don't seem
to be able


1368
1:3:25,18 --> 1:3:26,57
to explain or predict.


1369
1:3:26,57 --> 1:3:28,84
The challenge that all
of these weathermen face,


1370
1:3:28,84 --> 1:3:31,48
all of them, whether they're
aware of it or not--


1371
1:3:31,48 --> 1:3:34,36
sooner or later,
they will be aware of it.


1372
1:3:34,36 --> 1:3:38,48
And I went through a period
after the epiphany of,


1373
1:3:38,48 --> 1:3:41,39
"How did I not
see this sooner? How?


1374
1:3:41,39 --> 1:3:42,54
"I mean, seriously,


1375
1:3:42,54 --> 1:3:44,9
"I'm supposed to do this
for a living.


1376
1:3:44,9 --> 1:3:46,12
How did I not see this?"


1377
1:3:46,12 --> 1:3:49,36
We have--seem to have lost
our moral fiber


1378
1:3:49,36 --> 1:3:52,6
and our ethical compass
when we talk about


1379
1:3:52,6 --> 1:3:53,75
that we all should live
within an experiment


1380
1:3:53,75 --> 1:3:55,78
that somebody else
is conducting.


1381
1:3:55,78 --> 1:4:0,24
If you knew or could predict
the weather at any given time


1382
1:4:0,24 --> 1:4:1,3
in any given area,


1383
1:4:1,3 --> 1:4:3,87
then you control the fate
of mankind


1384
1:4:3,87 --> 1:4:5,84
and what they pay
for everything.


1385
1:4:5,84 --> 1:4:8,36
Washington is not responsive
to the average person.


1386
1:4:8,36 --> 1:4:10,36
It's responsive
to commercial interests,


1387
1:4:10,36 --> 1:4:12,24
who can spend millions
on campaigns now


1388
1:4:12,24 --> 1:4:15,36
without restriction,
who literally drive


1389
1:4:15,36 --> 1:4:17,54
the policy-making
in Washington, D.C.


1390
1:4:17,54 --> 1:4:19,69
I guess I'm under the belief


1391
1:4:19,69 --> 1:4:21,6
that you can't control
the weather.


1392
1:4:21,6 --> 1:4:24,36
Um, you know, I hope someday we
could control the weather.


1393
1:4:24,36 --> 1:4:27,3
Power becomes
an addictive thing.


1394
1:4:27,3 --> 1:4:30,36
We're taking what
the Creator has created,


1395
1:4:30,36 --> 1:4:32,78
usurping his authority,
and bringing it


1396
1:4:32,78 --> 1:4:37,12
under the authority
of corporations.


1397
1:4:37,12 --> 1:4:40,42
I'm worried that one person
or one group


1398
1:4:40,42 --> 1:4:43,36
would try to have that much
leverage over the whole planet.


1399
1:4:43,36 --> 1:4:48,9
I don't believe that anybody
has the right to play God,


1400
1:4:48,9 --> 1:4:50,33
especially when they're putting
particles and chemicals


1401
1:4:50,33 --> 1:4:52,24
into the atmosphere,


1402
1:4:52,24 --> 1:4:53,63
which there's unintended--


1403
1:4:53,63 --> 1:4:55,6
and consequences
that are known.


1404
1:4:55,6 --> 1:4:57,6
We don't know it all.


1405
1:4:57,6 --> 1:4:59,36
We can not assume the role
of Creator


1406
1:4:59,36 --> 1:5:1,39
without dire consequences.


1407
1:5:1,39 --> 1:5:3,39
This is not a good idea.


1408
1:5:3,39 --> 1:5:7,6
And this is not a reason
to take and do a test.


1409
1:5:7,6 --> 1:5:9,27
The atmosphere and the earth
belong to all of us.


1410
1:5:9,27 --> 1:5:12,36
It provides the food we eat,
the air we breathe,


1411
1:5:12,36 --> 1:5:13,54
the water we drink,


1412
1:5:13,54 --> 1:5:16,3
and no one should have
the right to own it.


1413
1:5:16,3 --> 1:5:18,78
The biosphere is at risk
from top to bottom.


1414
1:5:18,78 --> 1:5:20,36
Though you have climate
scientists


1415
1:5:20,36 --> 1:5:23,21
calling for emergency
geoengineering due to events


1416
1:5:23,21 --> 1:5:24,69
like methane mass expulsion,


1417
1:5:24,69 --> 1:5:26,81
which appears to be occurring
in the Arctic...


1418
1:5:26,81 --> 1:5:29,57
It would have
a significant impact


1419
1:5:29,57 --> 1:5:32,24
on the way that we operate.


1420
1:5:32,24 --> 1:5:36,15
Notice it also has enormous
political, social,


1421
1:5:36,15 --> 1:5:38,33
and economic implications.


1422
1:5:38,33 --> 1:5:41,51
And so we don't want to have
some giant planetary oops,


1423
1:5:41,51 --> 1:5:45,48
I mean, capital oops, in which
you have a loss of life.


1424
1:5:45,48 --> 1:5:49,15
It's much, much harder
to actually figure out


1425
1:5:49,15 --> 1:5:50,78
the environmental risks
and effectiveness


1426
1:5:50,78 --> 1:5:52,87
of these new methods
than it is to cook them up.


1427
1:5:52,87 --> 1:5:55,81
They're creating
an artificial environment


1428
1:5:55,81 --> 1:5:59,3
to replace
the natural environment.


1429
1:5:59,3 --> 1:6:2,84
Shredded ozone layer,
global droughts,


1430
1:6:2,84 --> 1:6:6,72
toxified soils,
poisoned populations.


1431
1:6:6,72 --> 1:6:8,72
Don't these issues matter?


1432
1:6:8,72 --> 1:6:12,27
Affecting ecosystems in ways
we've never been able before.


1433
1:6:12,27 --> 1:6:16,18
Um, the whole concept
of literally playing God


1434
1:6:16,18 --> 1:6:19,3
with the technology we have
at our fingertips today.


1435
1:6:19,3 --> 1:6:21,81
And however
the climate changes,


1436
1:6:21,81 --> 1:6:24,66
wouldn't we be better to let
the planet react on its own,


1437
1:6:24,66 --> 1:6:26,57
instead of trying
to play God?


1438
1:6:26,57 --> 1:6:30,6
It doesn't have any benefits
to society at all.


1439
1:6:30,6 --> 1:6:31,72
It doesn't benefit the plant.


1440
1:6:31,72 --> 1:6:33,45
It doesn't benefit the farmer.


1441
1:6:33,45 --> 1:6:35,3
It doesn't benefit
the environment.


1442
1:6:35,3 --> 1:6:36,69
It's all about money,


1443
1:6:36,69 --> 1:6:38,45
and weather is another form
of commoditizing,


1444
1:6:38,45 --> 1:6:40,21
a way the central command group
can commoditize


1445
1:6:40,21 --> 1:6:41,6
another form of our life.


1446
1:6:41,6 --> 1:6:44,12
Whereas the E.P.A. has stated
that there is going to be


1447
1:6:44,12 --> 1:6:46,6
more weather,


1448
1:6:46,6 --> 1:6:49,42
and they're attesting
it to climate change.


1449
1:6:49,42 --> 1:6:51,57
Well, I agree.


1450
1:6:51,57 --> 1:6:52,78
It's changing.


1451
1:6:52,78 --> 1:6:54,3
The weather's changing.


1452
1:6:54,3 --> 1:6:59,6
Now, the real issue is, is it
natural or is it manmade?


1453
1:6:59,6 --> 1:7:4,69
And if it's manmade,
who's doing it?


1454
1:7:4,69 --> 1:7:7,24
Is it the geoengineering guys?


1455
1:7:7,24 --> 1:7:9,0
That's what I believe
if geoengineering continues,


1456
1:7:9,0 --> 1:7:11,24
that whatever changes
are happening to the planet,


1457
1:7:11,24 --> 1:7:14,84
we will exponentially worsen
those changes


1458
1:7:14,84 --> 1:7:16,36
and poison everything
in the process,


1459
1:7:16,36 --> 1:7:18,78
and, indeed, with the amount
of metal falling on us,


1460
1:7:18,78 --> 1:7:21,3
that poisoning appears to have
been occurring now


1461
1:7:21,3 --> 1:7:23,15
for quite some time.


1462
1:7:23,15 --> 1:7:25,78
Why are you spraying
that stuff in our sky?


1463
1:7:25,78 --> 1:7:27,6
It's accumulating massive
amounts of wealth


1464
1:7:27,6 --> 1:7:29,0
in very few hands.


1465
1:7:29,0 --> 1:7:30,36
And that's what
they're trying to do


1466
1:7:30,36 --> 1:7:31,69
in all aspects
of these economies.


1467
1:7:31,69 --> 1:7:34,39
The money's not worth it.
This is my future.


1468
1:7:34,39 --> 1:7:36,3
I encourage people to get
involved in the projects


1469
1:7:36,3 --> 1:7:37,24
they're interested in,


1470
1:7:37,24 --> 1:7:38,63
whether it's this one
or some other one.


1471
1:7:38,63 --> 1:7:41,15
To thrive,
we need to organize


1472
1:7:41,15 --> 1:7:44,21
locally, nationally,
and globally


1473
1:7:44,21 --> 1:7:47,87
to expose and stop
this practice immediately.


1474
1:7:47,87 --> 1:7:49,87
Please quit free-riding
on our future.


1475
1:7:49,87 --> 1:7:51,33
But do what you can do.


1476
1:7:51,33 --> 1:7:53,42
And I think that's really
the answer for all of us,


1477
1:7:53,42 --> 1:7:56,81
is recognize that there is
a network more powerful


1478
1:7:56,81 --> 1:7:58,3
than the Internet.


1479
1:7:58,3 --> 1:7:59,39
It's the human race.


1480
1:7:59,39 --> 1:8:1,66
We are connected in a way
that's quite powerful.


1481
1:8:1,66 --> 1:8:5,27
The fact is, acting on what
we know to be right and true,


1482
1:8:5,27 --> 1:8:8,63
doing something
about what we care about


1483
1:8:8,63 --> 1:8:9,81
that we can do.


1484
1:8:9,81 --> 1:8:12,24
Please tell everyone
you know about this.


1485
1:8:12,24 --> 1:8:15,12
Bring this message
to community meetings,


1486
1:8:15,12 --> 1:8:18,24
demonstrations,
and other public events.


1487
1:8:18,24 --> 1:8:20,57
The work we're doing
will provide cover


1488
1:8:20,57 --> 1:8:22,54
for others to come out.


1489
1:8:22,54 --> 1:8:25,63
And I'm most interested
in whistleblowers.


1490
1:8:25,63 --> 1:8:29,6
Send this film
to environmental farm groups,


1491
1:8:29,6 --> 1:8:32,39
media groups, A.D.D.,
Alzheimer's, asthma groups,


1492
1:8:32,39 --> 1:8:35,6
and other organizations
that would do something


1493
1:8:35,6 --> 1:8:36,39
if they only knew.


1494
1:8:36,39 --> 1:8:40,69
Because we deserve--
deserve a future.


1495
1:8:40,69 --> 1:8:43,69
And if you control
the weather,


1496
1:8:43,69 --> 1:8:46,27
you're in control
of the planet.


1497
1:8:46,27 --> 1:8:47,6
It's that simple.


1498
1:8:47,6 --> 1:8:50,6
Some people address
this issue in fear.


1499
1:8:50,6 --> 1:8:52,69
Some people address it
in anger.


1500
1:8:52,69 --> 1:8:55,78
I address this in faith.


1501
1:8:55,78 --> 1:8:59,81
Faith believing that we,
collectively, as human beings,


1502
1:8:59,81 --> 1:9:3,33
as humanity, have the power
and the ability


1503
1:9:3,33 --> 1:9:18,69
to stop these
damaging programs.


1504
1:9:18,69 --> 1:9:22,78
[Skull's "Cry Die"]


1505
1:9:22,78 --> 1:9:28,45
All right, now here we go.


1506
1:9:28,45 --> 1:9:30,45
All right, now here we go.


1507
1:9:30,45 --> 1:9:33,3
[singing]
I look up to the sky


1508
1:9:33,3 --> 1:9:34,84
Can you tell me why?


1509
1:9:34,84 --> 1:9:36,24
Can you tell me why?


1510
1:9:36,24 --> 1:9:38,39
I don't wanna
see you cry


1511
1:9:38,39 --> 1:9:42,0
I just wanna see
you smile, baby


1512
1:9:42,0 --> 1:9:44,54
I look up to the sky


1513
1:9:44,54 --> 1:9:45,81
Can you tell me why?


1514
1:9:45,81 --> 1:9:47,33
Can you tell me why?


1515
1:9:47,33 --> 1:9:49,42
I don't wanna
see you die


1516
1:9:49,42 --> 1:9:52,87
I just wanna see you
smile, baby


1517
1:9:52,87 --> 1:9:55,21
Me look up in da sky,
and me can't see clear


1518
1:9:55,21 --> 1:9:57,78
Blue skies are gone
and white lines appear


1519
1:9:57,78 --> 1:9:59,45
Dem say it's natural


1520
1:9:59,45 --> 1:10:1,3
Me no believe dem


1521
1:10:1,3 --> 1:10:2,36
Dem say it's vital


1522
1:10:2,36 --> 1:10:3,69
Me no listen to dem


1523
1:10:3,69 --> 1:10:9,57
Something strange
is going on


1524
1:10:9,57 --> 1:10:10,63
Feel it in my heart


1525
1:10:10,63 --> 1:10:12,6
Sensing something strong


1526
1:10:12,6 --> 1:10:15,0
All right,
now here we go


1527
1:10:15,0 --> 1:10:17,78
Gotta save the future,
put the rumors to rest


1528
1:10:17,78 --> 1:10:20,54
Gotta help the children,
gotta give it the best


1529
1:10:20,54 --> 1:10:23,36
Can't stand around,
be blind to the facts


1530
1:10:23,36 --> 1:10:27,18
Can't take it no more,
how can we relax?


1531
1:10:27,18 --> 1:10:29,66
I look up to the sky


1532
1:10:29,66 --> 1:10:31,9
Can you tell me why?


1533
1:10:31,9 --> 1:10:32,45
Can you tell me why?


1534
1:10:32,45 --> 1:10:34,63
I don't wanna
see you cry


1535
1:10:34,63 --> 1:10:38,6
I just wanna see
you smile, baby


1536
1:10:38,6 --> 1:10:40,87
I look up to the sky


1537
1:10:40,87 --> 1:10:42,6
Can you tell me why?


1538
1:10:42,6 --> 1:10:44,3
Can you tell me why?


1539
1:10:44,3 --> 1:10:45,81
I don't wanna
see you die


1540
1:10:45,81 --> 1:10:49,24
I just wanna see you
smile, baby


1541
1:10:49,24 --> 1:10:51,63
Living on earth,
we must respect the earth


1542
1:10:51,63 --> 1:10:54,51
Human and animal,
we all deserve


1543
1:10:54,51 --> 1:10:57,3
The right to peace
and opportunity


1544
1:10:57,3 --> 1:10:59,12
But nowadays, we're blind


1545
1:10:59,12 --> 1:11:0,54
We can't see


1546
1:11:0,54 --> 1:11:1,78
Hidden agendas


1547
1:11:1,78 --> 1:11:2,87
But we can't surrender


1548
1:11:2,87 --> 1:11:4,36
Children are our future


1549
1:11:4,36 --> 1:11:5,72
We must remember


1550
1:11:5,72 --> 1:11:7,3
Oh, oh


1551
1:11:7,3 --> 1:11:8,51
Don't know
what's going on


1552
1:11:8,51 --> 1:11:9,57
Yeah


1553
1:11:9,57 --> 1:11:11,24
We must stand up
for the earth


1554
1:11:11,24 --> 1:11:12,45
Oh, oh


1555
1:11:12,45 --> 1:11:14,12
Don't know
what's going on


1556
1:11:14,12 --> 1:11:15,48
Tell ya


1557
1:11:15,48 --> 1:11:17,69
We must stand up
for the earth


1558
1:11:17,69 --> 1:11:20,45
I look up to the sky


1559
1:11:20,45 --> 1:11:22,0
Can you tell me why?


1560
1:11:22,0 --> 1:11:23,36
Can you tell me why?


1561
1:11:23,36 --> 1:11:25,54
I don't wanna
see you cry


1562
1:11:25,54 --> 1:11:29,0
I just wanna see
you smile, baby


1563
1:11:29,0 --> 1:11:31,84
I look up to the sky


1564
1:11:31,84 --> 1:11:33,24
Can you tell me why?


1565
1:11:33,24 --> 1:11:34,63
Can you tell me why?


1566
1:11:34,63 --> 1:11:36,72
I don't wanna
see you die


1567
1:11:36,72 --> 1:11:40,27
I just wanna see you
smile, baby


1568
1:11:40,27 --> 1:11:41,39
We want the truth


1569
1:11:41,39 --> 1:11:43,3
Give us the truth, yo


1570
1:11:43,3 --> 1:11:45,75
We want the truth,
gotta save our youth


1571
1:11:45,75 --> 1:11:46,78
We want the truth


1572
1:11:46,78 --> 1:11:48,51
Give us the truth


1573
1:11:48,51 --> 1:11:51,27
Unite as one,
bring out the proof


1574
1:11:51,27 --> 1:11:53,81
Living on earth,
we must respect the earth


1575
1:11:53,81 --> 1:11:56,66
Human and animal,
we all deserve


1576
1:11:56,66 --> 1:11:59,42
The right to peace
and opportunity


1577
1:11:59,42 --> 1:12:0,84
But nowadays, we're blind


1578
1:12:0,84 --> 1:12:2,57
We can't see


1579
1:12:2,57 --> 1:12:4,0
Hidden agendas


1580
1:12:4,0 --> 1:12:6,66
We can't surrender
children, our future


1581
1:12:6,66 --> 1:12:9,15
We must remember


1582
1:12:9,15 --> 1:12:10,27
All right


1583
1:12:10,27 --> 1:12:11,51
Ay, ay, ay, ay


1584
1:12:11,51 --> 1:12:14,27
All right,

1585
1:12:14,27 --> 1:12:17,0
I look up to the sky


1586
1:12:17,0 --> 1:12:18,51
Can you tell me why?


1587
1:12:18,51 --> 1:12:20,0
Can you tell me why?


1588
1:12:20,0 --> 1:12:22,12

1589
1:12:22,12 --> 1:12:25,54
I just wanna see
you smile, baby


1590
1:12:25,54 --> 1:12:28,42
I look up to the sky


1591
1:12:28,42 --> 1:12:29,81
Can you tell me why?


1592
1:12:29,81 --> 1:12:31,12

1593
1:12:31,12 --> 1:12:33,33
