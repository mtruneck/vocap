1
0:0:3,879 --> 0:0:7,25
to drive a DeLorean it's a completely
different experience


2
0:0:7,25 --> 0:0:10,51
from the moment you sink into it and
opening of a Gullwing door


3
0:0:10,51 --> 0:0:15,15
I was a teenager about the time
that the delorean came out back in 1981


4
0:0:15,15 --> 0:0:18,22
and it just was so different than
anything else out there as there's


5
0:0:18,22 --> 0:0:28,2
always a story to be told about Deloreans


6
0:0:28,2 --> 0:0:32,32
john delorean started his career as an
engineer with General Motors


7
0:0:32,32 --> 0:0:35,73
from that point he rose very quickly through
GM to be the


8
0:0:35,73 --> 0:0:39,83
youngest vice president and by the early
seventies he was in charge


9
0:0:39,83 --> 0:0:43,6
Chevrolet I think john delorean felt
hamstrung


10
0:0:43,6 --> 0:0:47,69
a bit within the constraints General
Motors he wanted to build a car


11
0:0:47,69 --> 0:0:51,27
was way he thought they should be built
and that would last beyond


12
0:0:51,27 --> 0:0:54,55
the regular model cycle of cars lasting
two or three years


13
0:0:54,55 --> 0:0:58,27
and then lost in a way. john knew the in
order to have his car stand out in the


14
0:0:58,27 --> 0:0:59,7
marketplace


15
0:0:59,7 --> 0:1:3,55
it needed to be different stainless
provided a unique solution to that


16
0:1:3,55 --> 0:1:7,84
by obviously not rusting and it also
solved the problem with having to put


17
0:1:7,84 --> 0:1:10,7
very expensive paint facilities in a
factory


18
0:1:10,7 --> 0:1:14,54
gullwing doors had only been used on a
couple other cars prior to that. John


19
0:1:14,54 --> 0:1:17,5
intended for the car to be an extremely
safe car and


20
0:1:17,5 --> 0:1:21,9
after working with the car as long as we
have here about thirty years yeah, that


21
0:1:21,9 --> 0:1:23,36
is the case. you know they got quite a
lot right


22
0:1:23,36 --> 0:1:25,44
the first go around


23
0:1:25,44 --> 0:1:28,78
the first prototypes were completed 76
77


24
0:1:28,78 --> 0:1:31,8
while they're looking for a place to
build a factory there very quickly


25
0:1:31,8 --> 0:1:34,69
discovered as soon as they mentioned
they were gonna at about 2000 to 2500


26
0:1:34,69 --> 0:1:35,46
jobs


27
0:1:35,46 --> 0:1:39,43
lots of governments came to them saying
we'd like you to build a factory here


28
0:1:39,43 --> 0:1:44,21
so John began to shop for the best
financial deal cuz he knew that would


29
0:1:44,21 --> 0:1:45,9
take a lot of money


30
0:1:45,9 --> 0:1:50,51
but then the northern ireland
development agency came through in 1978


31
0:1:50,51 --> 0:1:54,95
they started with a Greenfield plant of
about ninety acres. They're able to build


32
0:1:54,95 --> 0:2:0,67
a factory, design a car, hire people, train
people and start production in a span of about


33
0:2:0,67 --> 0:2:3,43
about twenty eight months which is a
record that probably still stands today


34
0:2:3,43 --> 0:2:6,53
thirty years later


35
0:2:6,53 --> 0:2:10,5
the first cars were built and they
started shipped to dealers in the summer


36
0:2:10,5 --> 0:2:11,53
of 1981.


37
0:2:11,53 --> 0:2:16,3
the auto industry was in a slump nobody
knew what was gonna happen and bomb


38
0:2:16,3 --> 0:2:19,9
out comes this car that look like
nothing else before. Stainless body


39
0:2:19,9 --> 0:2:23,6
gullwing doors that was a spaceship on
wheels. The press was abuzz.


40
0:2:23,6 --> 0:2:27,55
Initial public response was fantastic.
Everybody was going nuts for it it was a


41
0:2:27,55 --> 0:2:28,58
show-stopping


42
0:2:28,58 --> 0:2:32,5
pull up and there would be crowds around
them. There were some reports of people


43
0:2:32,5 --> 0:2:35,54
paying more than ten thousand dollars
over sticker price. Everybody would


44
0:2:35,54 --> 0:2:39,16
be clamoring to see one and touch one
which is still the same now everybody


45
0:2:39,16 --> 0:2:40,86
has to touch a Delorean you know


46
0:2:40,86 --> 0:2:42,93
 


47
0:2:42,93 --> 0:2:47,2
Trouble for the company first really
started in late 1981.


48
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:52,4
In order to improve the stock offering
that was planned they needed to be


49
0:2:52,4 --> 0:2:55,489
building a certain number of cars and
have a certain number people employed


50
0:2:55,489 --> 0:2:58,88
John to gamble and ordered production of
the car doubled.


51
0:2:58,88 --> 0:3:2,87
As far as the economy was concerned
interest rates were extremely high.


52
0:3:2,87 --> 0:3:6,68
And we got hit with the worst winter in
about 30 years so car sales


53
0:3:6,68 --> 0:3:9,75
pretty much dropped almost to nothing. So


54
0:3:9,75 --> 0:3:13,43
it was extremely difficult to sell
anything let alone


55
0:3:13,43 --> 0:3:18,69
an expensive sports car. In fact we kept
going building these cars hoping that


56
0:3:18,69 --> 0:3:19,45
the market would turn around


57
0:3:19,45 --> 0:3:22,819
in time by early 82 it was clear
that wasn't gonna happen


58
0:3:22,819 --> 0:3:27,54
John lost control in the factory in May
1982. He needed to come up with a


59
0:3:27,54 --> 0:3:30,799
a certain amount of money to regain
control the factory.


60
0:3:30,799 --> 0:3:34,69
About this time he was approached by one
of his neighbours


61
0:3:34,69 --> 0:3:38,79
and he told John that he could help him
get any kind of money he needed.


62
0:3:38,79 --> 0:3:41,42
In the summer of 82 when John realized
you know that this was some kind of a


63
0:3:41,42 --> 0:3:42,9
drug deal


64
0:3:42,9 --> 0:3:45,569
he tried to back out. According to his
testimony his family was threatened they


65
0:3:45,569 --> 0:3:48,4
threatened to cut off his daughter's head and send it home in a shopping bag


66
0:3:48,4 --> 0:3:51,519
he didn't feel he had any option except
to continue to go along with the deal.


67
0:3:51,519 --> 0:3:55,319
Turns out that this was a sting
operation.


68
0:3:55,319 --> 0:3:58,739
The DEA at that period wanted to the big bust
wanted to make


69
0:3:58,739 --> 0:4:2,81
a name for themselves. In late October
of 82 he was arrested.


70
0:4:2,81 --> 0:4:6,569
By the time John Delorean went to trial
in 1984


71
0:4:6,569 --> 0:4:10,0
company was gone and filed for bankruptcy
the factory


72
0:4:10,0 --> 0:4:13,63
contents have been sold or auctioned off.


73
0:4:13,63 --> 0:4:17,25
The DEA actually set him up and it was
entrapment, truth be known as he never


74
0:4:17,25 --> 0:4:21,5
went to jail he was completely acquitted
of all the drug charges.


75
0:4:21,5 --> 0:4:24,84
When the factory closed in late
1982


76
0:4:24,84 --> 0:4:29,25
there was literally millions of parts to build
cars still in the factory


77
0:4:29,25 --> 0:4:32,979
and is that inventory that which we now
have in our facility here. We have a


78
0:4:32,979 --> 0:4:37,1
40,000 square-foot facility full of
literally millions


79
0:4:37,1 --> 0:4:40,3
new old stock brand new 30-year-old
Delorean parts


80
0:4:40,3 --> 0:4:43,76
Out of the 2800 or so different parts
it takes to make up a DeLorean we've got


81
0:4:43,76 --> 0:4:47,6
better than 98 percent parts
availability.


82
0:4:47,6 --> 0:4:50,16
One of the other things that we acquired
with this inventory of parts was a


83
0:4:50,16 --> 0:4:51,96
complete set of engineering drawings


84
0:4:51,96 --> 0:4:55,19
and all the engineering record for the
parts on the car so as we run out of


85
0:4:55,19 --> 0:4:55,66
stuff


86
0:4:55,66 --> 0:4:59,94
we have a network of suppliers and
manufacturers all around the world


87
0:4:59,94 --> 0:5:5,169
who we work with to have some of these
parts reproduced.


88
0:5:5,169 --> 0:5:9,2
You can't talk about Delorean cars without
talking about Back to the Future.


89
0:5:9,2 --> 0:5:12,34
In the earliest versions of the script
they had intended to use


90
0:5:12,34 --> 0:5:16,639
a refrigerator as the time machine and
quickly realized you know that they


91
0:5:16,639 --> 0:5:19,409
didn't want kids climbing into
refrigerators cuz back in the day they


92
0:5:19,409 --> 0:5:19,979
had doors


93
0:5:19,979 --> 0:5:23,439
couldn't open from the inside and they
decided it would be easier to use some


94
0:5:23,439 --> 0:5:24,49
kind of an automobile.


95
0:5:24,49 --> 0:5:27,719
Since the company went out of business it's
been the


96
0:5:27,719 --> 0:5:30,949
greatest thing to happen to the DeLorean
car. Guaranteed


97
0:5:30,949 --> 0:5:35,199
some place in the world right now one of
those movies is on TV someplace so


98
0:5:35,199 --> 0:5:39,389
someone new is being exposed to the
DeLorean car for the first time.


99
0:5:39,389 --> 0:5:43,39
John left a legacy in the form of


100
0:5:43,39 --> 0:5:48,43
9000 or so cars that bear his name. I think
one of the reasons the Delorean remains


101
0:5:48,43 --> 0:5:52,139
sort of timeless because the delorean
never went through that


102
0:5:52,139 --> 0:5:55,319
evolutionary process because that
didn't


103
0:5:55,319 --> 0:5:59,699
happen Delorean is essentially frozen in
time. You know and as


104
0:5:59,699 --> 0:6:3,169
decades ago there are always certain
things that stick out


105
0:6:3,169 --> 0:6:7,389
and Delorean is definitely you know an
iconic part of the eighties.


106
0:6:7,389 --> 0:6:11,379
Had Delorean had survived


107
0:6:11,379 --> 0:6:14,62
that period in time and continued


108
0:6:14,62 --> 0:6:18,37
there would be a big 4 now there
wouldn't be a big three. Delorean


109
0:6:18,37 --> 0:6:20,33
himself he made Delorean


110
0:6:20,33 --> 0:6:26,63
and he also took it down.


111
0:6:26,63 --> 0:6:29,24
 


112
0:6:29,24 --> 0:6:33,46
As the story goes apparently on the day
that he was actually arrested


113
0:6:33,46 --> 0:6:37,7
they actually had an investment bank
lined up so they'd actually arranged for


114
0:6:37,7 --> 0:6:39,32
the resurrection of the company


115
0:6:39,32 --> 0:6:43,4
and all he had to do was sign the
document and they were looking for him


116
0:6:43,4 --> 0:6:46,83
all day they couldn't find him and then
the next thing they had that he was on


117
0:6:46,83 --> 0:6:48,12
the six o'clock news is


118
0:6:48,12 --> 0:6:52,52
have been arrested in Los Angeles
Airport and and that was the end of it


119
0:6:52,52 --> 0:6:54,36
the financing went away


120
0:6:54,36 --> 0:8:54,36
you know they just had that one last
chance and it didn't happen
