###1 Ooo! Ooo!  A fossil PROVES fish to tetrapod evolution, aren't you excited?
###6 Before that, we all were WORMS, open flagrant bigotry in both academia, and in
###12 our mailbag!  This is Genesis Week!
###15 [Music]
###30 And a welcome to this episode of Genesis Week, the weekly program of creationary
###35 commentary on news, views and events pertaining to the origins controversy,
###39 made possible by the supporters of CORE Ottawa - Citizens for Origins Research
###44 and Education, and exclusive right here on youtube.  Pirate broadcasting live from
###50 Superman's former secret fortress of solitude in the Canadian high arctic - but
###55 we're a little worried about what's gonna happen with our broadcast with all the
###58 solar flares going off and us being in the arctic and stuff.  But we'll keep
###62 broadcasting the information the anti-creationists don't want you to see or
###66 hear, and we'll give glory to the Creator while doing it.  Once again, #1 most talked
###72 about show in science and technology on YouTube.

###91 Stop me if you've heard this before!
###112 Oh how exciting!  What are they talking about? Tiktaalik? No, but they are talking
###117 about another fossil in the long line of alleged fishapods, which it seems I've
###123 wound up talking about for like, five or six different shows!  You'd think the press
###127 and these particular evolutionists would have learned their lesson by now!  But
###130 nope!  So what is it they're so excited about?  Well, it is a pretty spectacular
###134 fossil find to be sure.  Found in Scotland, these fossils allegedly fill in the famous
###139 "Romer's gap" which was named after Dr. Alfred Romer, an American Paleontologist
###145 who noted missing fossils in the fishapod timeline between 345 and 360 million
###152 years ago. Smithson, et al, reported on the Scottish
###155 fossil find in the latest PNAS, and the fossils have been assigned the precise
###161 evolutionary age of 348 to 347.6 Ma - give or take a week.  Particular excitement was
###170 over a fossil foot which had five toes. Devin Powell of Science News explains:
###206 Even in the PNAS article itself, the authors allude to the "fact" that this is
###212 earliest evidence of a fossil five-toed foot:
###230 Wait - let's take a look at the evolutionary timescale involved here.  I discussed this
###235 extensively on previous shows, but apparently these researchers don't watch
###239 this show and thus miss out on the valuable information we bring you that the
###244 anti-creationists don't want you to see or hear!
###246 Here's a pretty diagram showing how the evolution myth portrays fishapod
###251 evolution,  - and the approximate age that has been assigned to the five-toed fossil
###257 foot that was just reported.  As we go left-to-right on the chart, we go through
###263 evolutionary time as the fishees attempt to grow legs and walk up on to land -
###268 allegedly culminating in the five-toed foot. This gradual progression of evolution
###273 looks impressive in pretty pictures. To falsify this myth, all we have to do is show
###279 that there were ALREADY five-toed tetrapods before any of these creatures
###285 appeared in the evolutionary timeline.  And that is precisely what was already done
###290 years to decades earlier.  In 2010, a report was published - by evolutionists - of fossil
###297 tetrapod footprints in Poland dated 395 MILLION years old, according to the
###304 evolution myth. Those footprints were actually first found in 2002, and take a
###308 look and count'em yourself - 1- 1 toe! hahaha! toes!  But yet the creationists were way
###313 2! 2 toes! mwahahahaha! 3! 3 toes! hahaha oh enough of that.
###319 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toes! But yet the creationists were way
###322 ahead of the pack, with geologist John Mackay publicizing fossil tetrapod tracks
###327 in the Tapeats sandstone of Grand Canyon in 1987!  The Tapeats sandstone
###332 is dated according to the evolution myth as 525 million years old - that's way off
###339 the other end of our chart. Notice that the Scottish researchers have interpreted the
###344 fossil foot as having a reduced fifth toe, and also notice that the Polish
###349 researchers interpreted the same thing from their footprint, and also the
###353 reconstruction of Panderichthys has reduced a sixth toe.
###356 Looking at the Tapeats footprints, it appears it also has a reduced fifth toe
###361 impression.  So let's count'em - 1,2,3,4,5 toes!
###367 The Scottish researchers mentioned:
###375 Really?  Could it be that the collection failure was caused by the preconceptions
###381 and assumptions of evolution, which has hindered proper research? Because
###388 predictions based on the evolution myth would say you will find NO tetrapods in
###393 "older" rock formations.  Indeed it is a collection failure, and I lay the blame at
###399 the feet of the evolution myth.  We have still yet another example of how evolution
###405 has hindered scientific research and discovery - discoveries that falsify the
###409 evolution myth, and affirm that creatures like the tetrapods have been around since
###414 the beginning of Creation - just like the Bible says. Gee, I wonder what else the
###420 Bible is right about?
###423 Hot off the presses - your ancient ancestor was a worm!  Morris and Caron,
###428 publishing in Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,
###432 described more detail about a famous worm from the Burgess shale of British
###436 Columbia, Canada.  This worm like creature is called Pikaia, and a few years
###441 back, I participated in a research trip to the Burgess Shale with Harry Nibourg,
###445 owner of the Big Valley Creation Science Museum, Vance Nelson, owner of
###448 Canada's largest traveling creation museum with Creation Truth ministries,
###452 and Yours truly.  It's been touted for years that Pikaia is our ancient ancestor
###460 because it has a notochord - a soft, flexible, tube-like spine.  Morris and Caron
###466 made some more interesting discoveries upon examining multiple fossils under an
###470 electron microscope.  In the Royal Ontario Museum press release, Caron said:
###483 You and I of course, are chordates.
###486 Morris and Caron held nothing back in their press release:
###510 It was very interesting that while at the Burgess Shale, Vance Nelson noted that
###515 Pikaia held a suspicious resemblance to the modern sea lancelet.  In fact, some
###522 evolutionists have noticed the stark similarity too - but the evolutionists
###526 pointed to minor differences such as the lack of antennae on Pikaia.  However, a
###531 study by Purnell, et al, in a January 2010 Nature article, actually examined the
###538 decay of dead sea lancelets, and discovered to their shock that the decay
###543 of organisms can give a false story of EVOLUTION.  Their point was that it was
###549 assumed decay would take place at random, and their research showed decay
###553 was NOT random. In fact, it turns out that the very characters of organisms that are
###558 used by evolutionary scientists to determine the organisms' placement on
###562 the evolutionary tree were the FIRST characteristics to rot away!  So in the case
###569 of the sea lancelet, while some evolutionists have contended that the
###572 lack of antennae in Pikaia means it must be a different organism than the sea
###576 lancelet - look for yourself: The antennae was one of the first things to rot away on
###581 a dead sea lancelet.  Thus, Pikaia is probably just a slightly decayed sea
###586 lancelet, dead only a few days.
###590 So rather than proof that we (and all the other organisms with backbones) evolved
###595 from a worm, this appears to be more evidence that even organisms from the
###598 Burgess Shale - allegedly some of the oldest fossils in the world, have
###602 reproduced faithfully after their kind since the beginning of time - exactly what the
###608 Bible says, and contrary to what Evolution would predict.  Gee, I wonder
###613 what else the Bible is right about?
###615 In another case of flagrant, open bigotry in academia, Springer-Verlag, publisher of
###620 many scientific journals and books, had scheduled to publish a book entitled
###624 "Biological Information: New Perspectives," which was co-edited by Dr.
###628 Jonathan Sanford, co-inventor of the gene gun and a young earth creationist.
###635 The Panda's thumb website pointed out this book and Sanford's "Intelligent
###639 design" leanings, and suddenly the book was yanked from publication.  The book
###644 had already been peer reviewed -twice! But upon finding out that one of the book
###649 editors was an intelligent design advocate, Springer pulled the book for
###653 additional peer-review, with Merkel-Sobotta stated that Springer was
###658 unaware of the editors’ roles in the intelligent design movement, and Springer
###662 does not “endorse intelligent design as a legitimate area of scientific research.”
###666 Notice there was not a single thing found wrong with the book, scientifically
###672 speaking. It had already passed peer review.  This is nothing less than open,
###679 flagrant bigotry.  Even in the comments of my videos here, anti-creationists ridicule
###684 creationists as never doing any original research - which is patently false and
###688 incredibly ignorant, seeing as how many creationists have published in secular
###691 literature and there are four peer-reviewed scientific journals
###695 published by creationary organizations around the world.  Secular academia has
###699 even openly admitted, in print, that it will not publish creationary material -
###704 regardless of its scientific validity or merit.  Therefore the claim that
###710 creationists don't publish in peer reviewed journals is not just incredibly
###713 ignorant and untrue, it has nothing to do with whether or not the creationists are
###718 right, or whether or not what they are saying is scientific.
###722 In fact the evolution news website had a couple of fascinating, well written articles
###727 on the bogus criticism of lack of peer review:
###731 It isn't peer review anymore, it's peer pressure.  And peer review is just another
###736 avenue for the flagrant bigotry that goes on in academia toward anyone who dares
###741 question Darwin.  Well guess what folks, I'm here to Question Darwin, and you can
###746 see some of many scientific reasons why I doubt Darwin.  And if Darwin was wrong
###751 about evolution, I wonder what else he was wrong about?
###755 [Scary, dramatic music]
###759 Wahoo! mail for me?
###761 [clicking sounds of a geiger counter detecting radiation]
###768 Hmmmm....I wonder what it tastes like?
###773 [drinking sounds]
###776 [Scary, dramatic music]
###781 WOW - last weeks show was catapulted into the #1 most discussed video in
###787 Science and Technology again, there was no possible way for me to go through all
###790 the comments. Sadly, the anti-creationists once again lowered the bar with their
###794 comments that had IQ factors containing very large, negative integers.
###800 LaWilson was spouting off about polystrate trees being in-situ, when I
###804 clearly refuted that idea, even showing photographs so that YOU, the viewers,
###808 could see for yourself that the roots that are there, have been stripped of their
###813 rootlets, and that some were upside-down. They were not in-situ.
###817 Wilson also went off on some tangent about the Alberta beds being laid down on
###821 an ocean floor - which I never said.  In fact, it would appear that giant plants the
###826 size of TREES would not be buried on the ocean floor, along with dinosaurs
###830 apparently swimming to the ocean floor so they can walk around and leave
###834 footprints!  Wow wilson - Really? Where did you get this idea?  You didn't get it
###840 from me.
###842 Fusion840 also replied to one of Lawilson's ridiculous assertions with:
###878 Yes - in fact, in last week's show I even cited the ages assigned to coal formation.
###884 But apparently neither Lawilson, nor anyone else who doesn't want to believe,
###887 listened to that part. But hey - thanks for trying Fusion; hope you were wearing a
###891 helmet for all the beating your head against the wall you did.
###895 As for Derek Ager's comments about catastrophes interspersed with long
###899 periods of time, I thought ChrisCarlascio did a great job dismantling that idea:
###931 The Science Foundation also failed completely to see his own blindness,
###934 affirming by his comments that apparently he believes the laws of nature were
###939 different at the beginning, and don't apply the "first self replicating system" - an
###945 alleged system that has never been demonstrated by he or anyone else.
###949 As BenWalburn noted:
###961 Indeed.  But I just wish these guys would stop and think, see the error of your
###965 ways, and repent of their sins while they can.
