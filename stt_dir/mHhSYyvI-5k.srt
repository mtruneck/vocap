1
0:0:6,84 --> 0:0:10,4
More and more of us realise
there is no God


2
0:0:10,4 --> 0:0:15,68
and yet religion still has
a hold over us.


3
0:0:15,68 --> 0:0:18,72
I think ideas of saints
and sinners, heaven and hell


4
0:0:18,72 --> 0:0:20,32
still shape our thinking.


5
0:0:20,32 --> 0:0:25,8
I want to give you
a scientific alternative.


6
0:0:25,8 --> 0:0:29,12
This series is not about
whether God exists or not.


7
0:0:29,12 --> 0:0:31,84
It explores more challenging
questions.


8
0:0:31,84 --> 0:0:34,84
I'm going to be asking
what happens as we move on


9
0:0:34,84 --> 0:0:37,8
and leave religion behind?


10
0:0:37,8 --> 0:0:44,6
What will guide and inspire us
in a world free of all gods?


11
0:0:44,6 --> 0:0:48,68
How can an atheist find
meaning in life?


12
0:0:48,68 --> 0:0:54,64
How can we face death without
the comfort of the afterlife?


13
0:0:54,64 --> 0:0:58,0
And how should we think about
right and wrong?


14
0:0:58,0 --> 0:1:1,2
I have to believe there is a plan


15
0:1:1,2 --> 0:1:4,0
and that God is going to accomplish
something through this.


16
0:1:4,0 --> 0:1:6,96
I suppose Jesus is an unpaid
babysitter.


17
0:1:6,96 --> 0:1:9,28
It's like, if I'm not watching you,
Jesus is.


18
0:1:9,28 --> 0:1:13,44
So, do you think that we in the West
are too materialistic?


19
0:1:13,44 --> 0:1:15,4
I think so.


20
0:1:15,4 --> 0:1:18,36
This film is about sin.


21
0:1:18,36 --> 0:1:21,56
Even today, most of us
still carry around the religious


22
0:1:21,56 --> 0:1:26,4
notion of sin to tell
right from wrong.


23
0:1:26,4 --> 0:1:27,32
People ask me,


24
0:1:27,32 --> 0:1:30,68
"If you give up religion,
doesn't that mean anything goes?


25
0:1:30,68 --> 0:1:34,44
"Why not indulge in temptations,
in lust, and greed?"


26
0:1:34,44 --> 0:1:38,88
"Why not rape, why not steal?"


27
0:1:38,88 --> 0:1:42,32
I'm going to explore the power
the religious idea of sin


28
0:1:42,32 --> 0:1:46,4
has over our lives,
explain why it's unhelpful,


29
0:1:46,4 --> 0:1:49,68
and show how we can use reason
and science


30
0:1:49,68 --> 0:2:2,68
to find a better way to be good.


31
0:2:2,68 --> 0:2:5,12
SIRENS


32
0:2:5,12 --> 0:2:12,2
(REPORTER) 'Cars were set alight,
and shops looted.'


33
0:2:12,2 --> 0:2:14,44
DISTANT SIREN


34
0:2:14,44 --> 0:2:18,8
If we don't believe God is watching
over us, we abandon morality.


35
0:2:18,8 --> 0:2:21,48
That's what people say to me.


36
0:2:21,48 --> 0:2:24,12
Are they right?


37
0:2:24,12 --> 0:2:32,68
ALARMS BEEP


38
0:2:32,68 --> 0:2:34,24
This is London in 2011.


39
0:2:34,24 --> 0:2:36,96
For the past two nights
there have been riots,


40
0:2:36,96 --> 0:2:39,64
there have been windows smashed,
there has been looting.


41
0:2:39,64 --> 0:2:40,76
It's hard to know why.


42
0:2:40,76 --> 0:2:44,32
There doesn't seem to be any
very well articulated


43
0:2:44,32 --> 0:2:46,32
political motive,
no religious motive.


44
0:2:46,32 --> 0:2:49,32
It seems to be just more or less
anarchy for its own sake.


45
0:2:49,32 --> 0:2:51,88
Looting for its own sake.


46
0:2:51,88 --> 0:2:55,44
I suppose it's showing how fragile
the bonds of society are.


47
0:2:55,44 --> 0:2:57,44
How easily broken they can be.


48
0:2:57,44 --> 0:3:4,8
It's really quite frightening
in a way.


49
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:7,88
Before I look at what reason
can tell us about this,


50
0:3:7,88 --> 0:3:12,6
I want to explore the case
for religious morality.


51
0:3:12,6 --> 0:3:15,64
To understand the challenge
facing atheists like me,


52
0:3:15,64 --> 0:3:19,76
you need to meet someone
like Ray Lewis.


53
0:3:19,76 --> 0:3:21,0
Evening, boys.


54
0:3:21,0 --> 0:3:21,56
(BOYS)  Evening, sir.


55
0:3:21,56 --> 0:3:24,2
(BOYS)  Evening, sir.
How are you?


56
0:3:24,2 --> 0:3:26,0
Newham, east London.


57
0:3:26,0 --> 0:3:29,52
In a neighbourhood ravaged
by drugs and gang violence,


58
0:3:29,52 --> 0:3:32,6
youth workers are fighting back
with a tough love approach,


59
0:3:32,6 --> 0:3:36,4
inspired by Christian faith.


60
0:3:36,4 --> 0:3:39,16
Who's going to lead us in Grace
today before supper?


61
0:3:39,16 --> 0:3:43,6
Well done, Moses. Come down
the front here, son.


62
0:3:43,6 --> 0:3:46,16
Let's bow our heads in prayer.


63
0:3:46,16 --> 0:3:49,8
God bless this food as we eat today.


64
0:3:49,8 --> 0:3:53,32
'Some of the riots that we saw
in different parts of England


65
0:3:53,32 --> 0:3:55,2
reveal that we are in a great
state of crisis.


66
0:3:55,2 --> 0:3:58,88
I think what was going on was
a sense in which...


67
0:3:58,88 --> 0:4:0,56
Frankly, why not?


68
0:4:0,56 --> 0:4:4,88
What is it that will restrain me
from getting involved in that?


69
0:4:4,88 --> 0:4:7,48
That's what we're working with,
against that backdrop.


70
0:4:7,48 --> 0:4:14,28
We've got to carve out something
where the boys know where they are.


71
0:4:14,28 --> 0:4:18,16
Is the discipline stricter here
than it is at your normal school?


72
0:4:18,16 --> 0:4:19,72
Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.


73
0:4:19,72 --> 0:4:23,52
And do you get taught about things
like what's right and wrong?


74
0:4:23,52 --> 0:4:24,8
Yeah.


75
0:4:24,8 --> 0:4:26,44
What do you learn about that?


76
0:4:26,44 --> 0:4:29,0
Leadership? Yeah?


77
0:4:29,0 --> 0:4:33,4
We're told leadership traits, which
is bearing, courage, decisiveness,


78
0:4:33,4 --> 0:4:38,76
enthusiasm, initiative, integrity,
judgement, knowledge, perseverance.


79
0:4:38,76 --> 0:4:42,56
Very good. Perseverance? Very good.


80
0:4:42,56 --> 0:4:45,6
'I think that this country,
despite its riches,


81
0:4:45,6 --> 0:4:47,64
is morally bankrupt.


82
0:4:47,64 --> 0:4:50,52
I was talking to a young man recently
the other day, and he said,


83
0:4:50,52 --> 0:4:52,76
"I've been here 18 months,


84
0:4:52,76 --> 0:4:55,84
"and I realise I don't have
to lie and steal."


85
0:4:55,84 --> 0:4:58,68
He realised that he doesn't
have to do it.


86
0:4:58,68 --> 0:4:59,4
Yeah.


87
0:4:59,4 --> 0:5:1,88
Yeah.
He's 14 years of age.
I said, "What do you mean?"


88
0:5:1,88 --> 0:5:5,44
He said, "Well, every time somebody
asked me a question,


89
0:5:5,44 --> 0:5:9,24
"it never dawned on me
to tell the truth.


90
0:5:9,24 --> 0:5:12,8
"I've grown up in a culture
where everybody lies,


91
0:5:12,8 --> 0:5:18,16
"everybody cheats,
everybody deceives."


92
0:5:18,16 --> 0:5:23,12
Ray Lewis makes a powerful case
for the clear-cut rules of religion.


93
0:5:23,12 --> 0:5:25,48
For him, God and an afterlife


94
0:5:25,48 --> 0:5:30,36
instil a sense of responsibility
in this life.


95
0:5:30,36 --> 0:5:34,8
I believe that there is
a spirit in a man and a woman


96
0:5:34,8 --> 0:5:36,24
that goes on beyond, and therefore


97
0:5:36,24 --> 0:5:39,0
at some point that has to come
into account.


98
0:5:39,0 --> 0:5:40,68
Now, that's what I choose to believe.


99
0:5:40,68 --> 0:5:42,84
I'm not going to argue
for the science of it.


100
0:5:42,84 --> 0:5:46,28
But what I would say
is I actually do believe


101
0:5:46,28 --> 0:5:48,24
that there will be a point
at which


102
0:5:48,24 --> 0:5:52,8
we have to give an account for
the lives that we've been given.


103
0:5:52,8 --> 0:5:55,44
I think there is no evidence
that we do survive death.


104
0:5:55,44 --> 0:5:58,28
And so, this life is what we've got,
and we should...


105
0:5:58,28 --> 0:6:0,36
That should really redouble
our efforts


106
0:6:0,36 --> 0:6:2,16
to make this life worthwhile,
not just for ourselves,


107
0:6:2,16 --> 0:6:3,28
to make this life worthwhile,
not just for ourselves,
Right.


108
0:6:3,28 --> 0:6:5,72
but for other people. Try to make
the world a better place,


109
0:6:5,72 --> 0:6:7,16
cos it's the only world we've got.


110
0:6:7,16 --> 0:6:11,4
I wonder whether or not you have
rejected the trappings,


111
0:6:11,4 --> 0:6:14,8
the bullshit of religion,


112
0:6:14,8 --> 0:6:17,32
rather than looking behind it.


113
0:6:17,32 --> 0:6:20,88
Because, you see, for me,
to look beyond this life


114
0:6:20,88 --> 0:6:23,96
gives this life a greater sense
of focus.


115
0:6:23,96 --> 0:6:28,24
That, I think, is something
that religion brings and gives


116
0:6:28,24 --> 0:6:30,16
and celebrates.


117
0:6:30,16 --> 0:6:32,8
And without that, Richard,


118
0:6:32,8 --> 0:6:35,72
we've just got intellectual
masturbation, haven't we?


119
0:6:35,72 --> 0:6:39,36
We don't all have your intellect
and your scientific genius,


120
0:6:39,36 --> 0:6:43,12
so how are we going to get to
the point that we can work it all out


121
0:6:43,12 --> 0:6:46,4
in this kind of fuddy-duddy way?


122
0:6:46,4 --> 0:6:49,24
I have no illusions.
I mean, it's very, very difficult.


123
0:6:49,24 --> 0:6:52,32
My solution would not be
a religious one.


124
0:6:52,32 --> 0:6:53,72
You try to educate people,


125
0:6:53,72 --> 0:6:56,92
which you're doing brilliantly,
it seems to me.


126
0:6:56,92 --> 0:7:0,24
We could sit down together
and talk to each other and say,


127
0:7:0,24 --> 0:7:3,12
"I would not wish to live
in the kind of society..."


128
0:7:3,12 --> 0:7:7,6
But, Richard, I hear you, but without
religion, do you not lose power?


129
0:7:7,6 --> 0:7:10,96
What drives me in this work
is some sense of the spirit.


130
0:7:10,96 --> 0:7:13,2
Martin Luther King,
he talked about soul force.


131
0:7:13,2 --> 0:7:18,8
Gandhi was very much leaning on his
spiritual sense of God, if you like.


132
0:7:18,8 --> 0:7:25,88
If you don't have that, how is it
going to happen? There's no power.


133
0:7:25,88 --> 0:7:28,4
This is challenging.


134
0:7:28,4 --> 0:7:31,52
There's no doubt that Ray Lewis
is being very effective.


135
0:7:31,52 --> 0:7:34,52
I can see the value of invoking
God's authority,


136
0:7:34,52 --> 0:7:38,96
and great leaders like
Martin Luther King and Gandhi


137
0:7:38,96 --> 0:7:42,64
who had religion, too.
But there's a problem.


138
0:7:42,64 --> 0:7:46,4
This approach is about persuading
children that they'll be


139
0:7:46,4 --> 0:7:48,28
held to account in an afterlife.


140
0:7:48,28 --> 0:7:50,16
But there is no evidence for that,


141
0:7:50,16 --> 0:7:54,96
and the more you think about it,
the more implausible it seems.


142
0:7:54,96 --> 0:7:58,24
And also, do we really want
to take our morals


143
0:7:58,24 --> 0:8:9,0
straight from the rather rigid
rulebook of an ancient desert tribe?


144
0:8:9,0 --> 0:8:10,68
It's your move.


145
0:8:10,68 --> 0:8:15,16
All righty then.


146
0:8:15,16 --> 0:8:16,84
You remember King Solomon?


147
0:8:16,84 --> 0:8:18,72
Well, I never met him personally.


148
0:8:18,72 --> 0:8:20,76
He was one of the most wisest kings


149
0:8:20,76 --> 0:8:23,8
that ever walked the face
of the planet Earth,


150
0:8:23,8 --> 0:8:25,88
but his wisdom
did not come overnight.


151
0:8:25,88 --> 0:8:33,64
He had to humble his spirit and
bow down to the true and living God.


152
0:8:33,64 --> 0:8:38,12
People tell me that if there is
no God, there is no morality.


153
0:8:38,12 --> 0:8:40,52
It's true that throughout
human history,


154
0:8:40,52 --> 0:8:45,8
religion has handed down
simple rules on what's good and bad.


155
0:8:45,8 --> 0:8:50,72
But it's a belief system rooted in
a Bronze Age view of the world,


156
0:8:50,72 --> 0:8:55,72
obsessed with sex and policing
the purity of the tribe.


157
0:8:55,72 --> 0:8:58,52
Before I set out
the rational view of morality,


158
0:8:58,52 --> 0:9:4,68
I want to explain the problems
with the old religious moral codes.


159
0:9:4,68 --> 0:9:8,96
Here we go. Understanding the enemy -
three enemies we face.


160
0:9:8,96 --> 0:9:12,96
The world, the Devil and the flesh.
I'm going to go quickly
through the world and the Devil.


161
0:9:12,96 --> 0:9:15,72
We're going to spend most of our time
dealing with the flesh.


162
0:9:15,72 --> 0:9:19,32
What we don't want to do is get hung
up on, "Oh, the Devil made me do it."


163
0:9:19,32 --> 0:9:22,6
We just want to see how the devil
interacts and specifically


164
0:9:22,6 --> 0:9:25,0
how Jesus modelled
some countermeasures.


165
0:9:25,0 --> 0:9:28,52
This is Every Man's Battle,
a Christian ministry


166
0:9:28,52 --> 0:9:33,64
that runs hundreds of workshops
across America every year.


167
0:9:33,64 --> 0:9:36,8
Here, they adapt ancient scriptures


168
0:9:36,8 --> 0:9:42,16
to try to fight modern male
temptations like internet porn.


169
0:9:42,16 --> 0:9:46,72
Sin offers us the opportunity
to meet a legitimate need
in an illegitimate way.


170
0:9:46,72 --> 0:9:49,44
Let's talk about the body
for a minute and masturbation.


171
0:9:49,44 --> 0:9:52,72
If you continue to do it, you will
be perpetually locked


172
0:9:52,72 --> 0:9:55,64
into this struggle
with your sexual integrity.


173
0:9:55,64 --> 0:9:58,32
Does this make sense?


174
0:9:58,32 --> 0:10:3,88
Questions.


175
0:10:3,88 --> 0:10:6,24
Christianity has always been
peculiarly judgemental


176
0:10:6,24 --> 0:10:9,56
about what people get up to
in the bedroom.


177
0:10:9,56 --> 0:10:16,4
But do we really want to brand
everyday thoughts as sinful?


178
0:10:16,4 --> 0:10:20,36
"I don't deserve my family" is
the shame message they would hear.


179
0:10:20,36 --> 0:10:24,68
These are in a list of probably
40 or 50 different shame messages


180
0:10:24,68 --> 0:10:27,6
they can choose from,
or they can write in their own.


181
0:10:27,6 --> 0:10:30,6
A couple of months ago,
we had a guy here


182
0:10:30,6 --> 0:10:33,36
who his shame message
was "I'm a (BLEEP) idiot."


183
0:10:33,36 --> 0:10:35,28
That wasn't on your list?


184
0:10:35,28 --> 0:10:37,28
That was not on our list.


185
0:10:37,28 --> 0:10:40,2
Aren't you being very hard
on yourselves?


186
0:10:40,2 --> 0:10:42,8
No, I don't think so.


187
0:10:42,8 --> 0:10:45,76
My story is filled with pornography,
masturbation, online affairs,


188
0:10:45,76 --> 0:10:47,6
that eventually went offline.


189
0:10:47,6 --> 0:10:50,32
I came to the point
of really just being suicidal.


190
0:10:50,32 --> 0:10:52,84
I hated my behaviour, I hated myself.


191
0:10:52,84 --> 0:10:56,16
I prayed a bajillion times for God
to show up and he wouldn't.


192
0:10:56,16 --> 0:10:57,6
It's like he was silent.


193
0:10:57,6 --> 0:11:0,68
I wasn't about to tell
my wife or any of my friends.


194
0:11:0,68 --> 0:11:3,72
My wife would divorce me and my
friends would disown me, I thought.


195
0:11:3,72 --> 0:11:7,24
I came to this place
and the only way for this to end
is for me to kill myself.


196
0:11:7,24 --> 0:11:9,4
I had this moment in the shower


197
0:11:9,4 --> 0:11:11,36
where I fell to the bottom
of the shower


198
0:11:11,36 --> 0:11:14,64
in this puddle of tears
and vomit and soapy water


199
0:11:14,64 --> 0:11:18,84
under the weight of the reality
of my life, that I can't fix this.


200
0:11:18,84 --> 0:11:21,24
I cried out to God in surrender.


201
0:11:21,24 --> 0:11:23,8
"You have to fix this."


202
0:11:23,8 --> 0:11:25,32
That's when everything
changed for me.


203
0:11:25,32 --> 0:11:27,56
This is my wife Shelly
and my son Truman


204
0:11:27,56 --> 0:11:29,72
a couple of years ago hiking in Vale.


205
0:11:29,72 --> 0:11:32,96
When I think about the way
that this day went,


206
0:11:32,96 --> 0:11:34,64
or I think about that day there,


207
0:11:34,64 --> 0:11:37,36
the last thing I want to do
is cheat on that woman.


208
0:11:37,36 --> 0:11:40,96
The last thing I want to do is tell
this little boy,


209
0:11:40,96 --> 0:11:44,24
"Hey, your dad was an adulterer
and then he got his life right


210
0:11:44,24 --> 0:11:46,88
"and then he wrecked it again."


211
0:11:46,88 --> 0:11:55,52
I don't want to have
that conversation.


212
0:11:55,52 --> 0:12:1,28
Jason no doubt has laudable aims,
but does this preaching work?


213
0:12:1,28 --> 0:12:16,24
Do religious believers resist
temptation better than anyone else?


214
0:12:16,24 --> 0:12:21,24
In 2011, the psychologist
Darrel Ray scoured the evidence.


215
0:12:21,24 --> 0:12:23,24
Through an online survey,


216
0:12:23,24 --> 0:12:27,6
he interrogated over 14,000 people
who had left their churches


217
0:12:27,6 --> 0:12:35,4
about their sex lives
before and after religion.


218
0:12:35,4 --> 0:12:38,12
We asked four questions -
when did you start masturbating,


219
0:12:38,12 --> 0:12:40,84
when did you start having oral sex,
when did you start petting


220
0:12:40,84 --> 0:12:42,84
and when did you start
having intercourse?


221
0:12:42,84 --> 0:12:45,72
We compared those people
who were raised most religious


222
0:12:45,72 --> 0:12:48,0
with those who were raised
least religious.


223
0:12:48,0 --> 0:12:50,4
We had thousands of people
in both of these groups,


224
0:12:50,4 --> 0:12:55,96
and what we found was
there's almost no difference.


225
0:12:55,96 --> 0:12:59,4
We did see a little bump
in pornography.


226
0:12:59,4 --> 0:13:3,44
The older religious people got,
the more they use pornography


227
0:13:3,44 --> 0:13:7,28
and they actually exceed
non-religious people by 5 or 10%


228
0:13:7,28 --> 0:13:9,6
in the use of pornography.


229
0:13:9,6 --> 0:13:12,76
Whether you're religious or not,
biology happens.


230
0:13:12,76 --> 0:13:14,76
You're going to start masturbating,


231
0:13:14,76 --> 0:13:18,44
you're going to start having sex,
but what's the difference? Guilt.


232
0:13:18,44 --> 0:13:22,64
The religious people feel a lot
of guilt about the premarital sex
they're having


233
0:13:22,64 --> 0:13:26,0
or about the masturbation
they've started.


234
0:13:26,0 --> 0:13:32,4
They don't know what to do with it.


235
0:13:32,4 --> 0:13:36,52
There's really no difference
in the actual sexual behaviour


236
0:13:36,52 --> 0:13:39,28
that religious and non-religious
people indulge in.


237
0:13:39,28 --> 0:13:42,32
What is different is
the guilt they feel?


238
0:13:42,32 --> 0:13:46,0
Religions preach against pornography,
preach against masturbation,


239
0:13:46,0 --> 0:13:49,92
preach against premarital sex,
and it does no good.


240
0:13:49,92 --> 0:13:52,92
The highest use of pornography
in the United States


241
0:13:52,92 --> 0:13:54,56
is in Utah and Mississippi.


242
0:13:54,56 --> 0:13:57,32
These are things
that churches preach against


243
0:13:57,32 --> 0:14:1,12
and yet their members are using it
even more than secular people do.


244
0:14:1,12 --> 0:14:3,4
When I give my talks on sex,
I often tend to ask,


245
0:14:3,4 --> 0:14:5,12
"How many of you masturbate?"


246
0:14:5,12 --> 0:14:8,24
I'll get people raising their hands
all over the place, maybe 80 or 90%.


247
0:14:8,24 --> 0:14:11,8
Some people will raise both hands!


248
0:14:11,8 --> 0:14:13,92
If I ask that same question
in a religious group,


249
0:14:13,92 --> 0:14:15,64
nobody will raise their hand,


250
0:14:15,64 --> 0:14:18,76
but we know that somewhere
in the neighbourhood


251
0:14:18,76 --> 0:14:23,8
of 95% of males masturbate,
and 70 to 75% of females masturbate.


252
0:14:23,8 --> 0:14:26,92
If nobody is raising their hand,
that tells us they're lying.


253
0:14:26,92 --> 0:14:28,56
Religious people lie.


254
0:14:28,56 --> 0:14:31,36
My own grandmother lived 83 years,


255
0:14:31,36 --> 0:14:35,92
she went to the grave
denying that she was ever divorced,


256
0:14:35,92 --> 0:14:38,12
because her religious beliefs


257
0:14:38,12 --> 0:14:41,52
said divorced people
are condemned and damned.


258
0:14:41,52 --> 0:14:43,16
She never admitted it.


259
0:14:43,16 --> 0:14:46,28
We all knew she had,
but that's the power of religion


260
0:14:46,28 --> 0:15:0,48
to hold an entire lifetime hostage.
That's a lot of pain.


261
0:15:0,48 --> 0:15:2,24
So the extraordinary thing


262
0:15:2,24 --> 0:15:5,96
is that not only does religion
fail to stop people sinning,


263
0:15:5,96 --> 0:15:9,4
it also forces them to live a lie.


264
0:15:9,4 --> 0:15:14,12
The most powerful example of this
I found in Paris.


265
0:15:14,12 --> 0:15:18,28
Here we can see religious tradition
for what it is,


266
0:15:18,28 --> 0:15:24,56
as the lies spiral into hypocrisy.


267
0:15:24,56 --> 0:15:29,76
A few hundred metres
from the smart boutiques
of the Champs Elysee in Paris,


268
0:15:29,76 --> 0:15:32,8
the plastic surgeon
Dr Marc Abecassis


269
0:15:32,8 --> 0:15:38,4
can cover up the sins of the past.


270
0:15:38,4 --> 0:15:42,72
He specialises in repairing the
hymen membrane in women's vaginas.


271
0:15:42,72 --> 0:15:45,96
To all appearances, he turns women
who have had sex


272
0:15:45,96 --> 0:15:49,8
back into virgins again.


273
0:15:49,8 --> 0:15:53,88
You can ask yourself as a surgeon,
is it fair?


274
0:15:53,88 --> 0:15:57,56
Am I in the right path to do that?


275
0:15:57,56 --> 0:16:1,4
These are questions that we ask
a lot to the patients.


276
0:16:1,4 --> 0:16:3,64
Are you going to be sincere
doing that, Miss?


277
0:16:3,64 --> 0:16:4,8
Indeed.


278
0:16:4,8 --> 0:16:11,0
Aren't you building a wedding
or a relation on a lie?


279
0:16:11,0 --> 0:16:15,72
More and more,
I ask these questions,


280
0:16:15,72 --> 0:16:17,92
more and more I have
the same answers.


281
0:16:17,92 --> 0:16:22,2
They just ask me, "Dr Abecassis,
who do you think you are?


282
0:16:22,2 --> 0:16:25,36
"Maybe I'm not going to be a virgin
in the facts,


283
0:16:25,36 --> 0:16:31,4
"but I want to rehabilitate myself.
I want to restore my integrity.


284
0:16:31,4 --> 0:16:36,16
"This is a pureness to give back
to the person I shall love


285
0:16:36,16 --> 0:16:39,4
"or I shall marry with."


286
0:16:39,4 --> 0:16:41,32
But this hymen reconstruction,


287
0:16:41,32 --> 0:16:46,8
it's just symbolic
of something which is not there.


288
0:16:46,8 --> 0:16:48,6
It's a lie.


289
0:16:48,6 --> 0:16:51,8
It's a lie for you.


290
0:16:51,8 --> 0:16:57,6
Dr Abecassis performs around four
of these operations every week


291
0:16:57,6 --> 0:17:0,44
and demand is growing.


292
0:17:0,44 --> 0:17:4,52
The majority of patients are
Algerian Muslims and for many,


293
0:17:4,52 --> 0:17:10,28
sadly, this is not some luxury
option but grim necessity.


294
0:17:10,28 --> 0:17:13,48
They tell you,
"My brother is going to kill me."


295
0:17:13,48 --> 0:17:17,44
There is this bad situation
in which they are going to be


296
0:17:17,44 --> 0:17:20,8
if they don't present
an intact membrane.


297
0:17:20,8 --> 0:17:23,64
That means if they don't bleed,
does it?


298
0:17:23,64 --> 0:17:29,8
They know today more and more
that they are not obliged to bleed,


299
0:17:29,8 --> 0:17:33,2
but they know that
if there will be a resistance


300
0:17:33,2 --> 0:17:37,76
during the intercourse,
things are going to be all right.


301
0:17:37,76 --> 0:17:45,92
The husband is going to feel
that there is something.


302
0:17:45,92 --> 0:17:51,92
For her own safety, this patient
has asked to remain anonymous.


303
0:17:51,92 --> 0:17:53,72
(TRANSLATION) I don't risk death.


304
0:17:53,72 --> 0:17:59,24
I don't think so, because
after all I have a family which
remains quite humane,


305
0:17:59,24 --> 0:18:4,8
but I do risk being set apart
and judged.


306
0:18:4,8 --> 0:18:10,4
In North African society, you don't
wash your dirty linen in public.


307
0:18:10,4 --> 0:18:13,24
Religious faith is supposed
to make us pure,


308
0:18:13,24 --> 0:18:15,56
but this woman is caught
between two sins -


309
0:18:15,56 --> 0:18:20,48
public shame and private deception.


310
0:18:20,48 --> 0:18:25,2
I think in front of God,
I shall be alone.


311
0:18:25,2 --> 0:18:29,28
In front of my community,
my image may also tarnish my family.


312
0:18:29,28 --> 0:18:32,6
I am not alone.
You see what I mean?


313
0:18:32,6 --> 0:18:35,84
That's to say, it's not just me
they'll be judging.


314
0:18:35,84 --> 0:18:41,4
They'll be judging my parents, my
grandparents, my uncles, my aunts.


315
0:18:41,4 --> 0:18:47,44
When I looked around at where I was
living, a society full of lies,


316
0:18:47,44 --> 0:18:55,48
I don't feel guilty at all.


317
0:18:55,48 --> 0:19:0,12
It's not just that the old notion
of sin isn't relevant any more.


318
0:19:0,12 --> 0:19:2,8
We've seen that
it clashes with reality,


319
0:19:2,8 --> 0:19:10,8
it creates guilt
and a society full of lies.


320
0:19:10,8 --> 0:19:12,72
Next, I want to leave God behind


321
0:19:12,72 --> 0:19:28,92
and explore what science can tell us
about the true origins of morality.


322
0:19:28,92 --> 0:19:31,96
'Some people think that
if we get rid of God


323
0:19:31,96 --> 0:19:37,64
'and all religious values,
all that's left is anarchy.


324
0:19:37,64 --> 0:19:42,8
'But I want to show that there is
order without religion.


325
0:19:42,8 --> 0:19:47,0
'Let's look at the roots of morality
through Darwinian eyes.


326
0:19:47,0 --> 0:19:50,0
'One thing we must do is rid
ourselves of the idea that


327
0:19:50,0 --> 0:19:55,8
'sexual lust is inherently sinful.


328
0:19:55,8 --> 0:19:56,96
'These impulses are universal,


329
0:19:56,96 --> 0:20:3,0
'and all mammals have evolved
ways to manage them.'


330
0:20:3,0 --> 0:20:5,6
What's that funny patch
I can see under his arm, there?


331
0:20:5,6 --> 0:20:8,8
This lump you can see here is
the brachial glands,


332
0:20:8,8 --> 0:20:9,68
and it's where he'll scent mark


333
0:20:9,68 --> 0:20:13,6
so the female can smell that
he's a good, fit male.


334
0:20:13,6 --> 0:20:18,2
'At Cotswold Wildlife Park,
the keepers are trying to get


335
0:20:18,2 --> 0:20:20,32
'a rare and endangered species,


336
0:20:20,32 --> 0:20:24,96
'the greater bamboo lemur,

337
0:20:24,96 --> 0:20:27,96
'But to do that, they have to
carefully observe


338
0:20:27,96 --> 0:20:33,0
'the rituals of lemur courtship.'


339
0:20:33,0 --> 0:20:34,16
He's being very good now,


340
0:20:34,16 --> 0:20:36,32
he's giving her the calls,
which are the beginning


341
0:20:36,32 --> 0:20:38,44
of his courtship display,
his call that he'll do.


342
0:20:38,44 --> 0:20:40,72
There's the tail twitching,
and all of this,


343
0:20:40,72 --> 0:20:45,36
she becomes more and more
interested in his behaviour.


344
0:20:45,36 --> 0:20:50,12
'Perhaps we think of morality
in completely the wrong way.


345
0:20:50,12 --> 0:20:55,12
'By observing animals, we see it
not as some set of lofty ideals,


346
0:20:55,12 --> 0:20:58,28
'but as a practical system
that enables animals


347
0:20:58,28 --> 0:21:2,76
'to get along with each other,
reproduce and survive.'


348
0:21:2,76 --> 0:21:5,76
Jamie, I was once asked by a lawyer
when he discovered that


349
0:21:5,76 --> 0:21:10,2
I was a zoologist, whether animals
have a sense of law.


350
0:21:10,2 --> 0:21:12,12
And I said, "Well, not exactly law,


351
0:21:12,12 --> 0:21:15,0
"but like many human societies
that don't have lawyers


352
0:21:15,0 --> 0:21:17,56
"and policeman, they have customs
and taboos


353
0:21:17,56 --> 0:21:20,52
"and rules that they follow."


354
0:21:20,52 --> 0:21:23,4
Yeah, I would say they certainly do.


355
0:21:23,4 --> 0:21:25,84
You know, there is almost
a feeding order,


356
0:21:25,84 --> 0:21:29,32
so the dominant animal would get the
best of the food or the food first.


357
0:21:29,32 --> 0:21:32,44
That doesn't mean that others
may not try to get in there first,


358
0:21:32,44 --> 0:21:34,76
very much like in human society,


359
0:21:34,76 --> 0:21:37,68
but if they are seen, they'll
certainly fall back into line.


360
0:21:37,68 --> 0:21:41,76
It's the biggest male, generally,
that will breed.


361
0:21:41,76 --> 0:21:44,52
'Critical for any animal's genetic
success


362
0:21:44,52 --> 0:21:47,24
'are the customs surrounding sex,


363
0:21:47,24 --> 0:21:51,6
'and the violence and competition
that sex can unleash.'


364
0:21:51,6 --> 0:21:54,76
364 days of the year,
the females are the boss.


365
0:21:54,76 --> 0:21:57,32
The male's very laid-back,
he keeps out of the way.


366
0:21:57,32 --> 0:22:0,36
Keeps himself to himself and just
tries to avoid trouble, generally.


367
0:22:0,36 --> 0:22:2,64
But on the one day of the year,
sometimes more,


368
0:22:2,64 --> 0:22:6,64
that the females become
sexually receptive, things change.


369
0:22:6,64 --> 0:22:9,12
Things become very, very lawless
for the male,


370
0:22:9,12 --> 0:22:11,12
and if there was
more than one breeding male,


371
0:22:11,12 --> 0:22:12,64
it really is a fight to the death.


372
0:22:12,64 --> 0:22:14,52
So they fight to the death
on that one day?


373
0:22:14,52 --> 0:22:15,84
They can do.


374
0:22:15,84 --> 0:22:18,16
Generally, one animal would be
severely injured.


375
0:22:18,16 --> 0:22:20,44
They do stink fighting,
which is very interesting,


376
0:22:20,44 --> 0:22:22,68
where they raise their tails
towards each other,


377
0:22:22,68 --> 0:22:25,72
waft them towards each other
so they can deter the other male.


378
0:22:25,72 --> 0:22:28,56
And then they do something
called slash fighting,


379
0:22:28,56 --> 0:22:30,24
where they'll run past each other,


380
0:22:30,24 --> 0:22:33,8
and it's very hard to even see
they've touched each other,


381
0:22:33,8 --> 0:22:35,76
but then there will be some
terrible slash injuries.


382
0:22:35,76 --> 0:22:39,28
So like medieval lancers on their
horses, rushing past each other.


383
0:22:39,28 --> 0:22:40,92
Very much like that, yes.


384
0:22:40,92 --> 0:22:44,76
So from a very coherent society
most of the year,


385
0:22:44,76 --> 0:22:50,88
it all falls to pieces
where sex is concerned.


386
0:22:50,88 --> 0:22:54,28
'This isn't what we'd call morality,
but the customs and taboos


387
0:22:54,28 --> 0:23:2,6
'we see here help us understand
something about sex.'


388
0:23:2,6 --> 0:23:7,8
Sex is, on the face of it, a rather
bizarre way of passing on genes,


389
0:23:7,8 --> 0:23:10,84
since it necessitates joining with
another individual,


390
0:23:10,84 --> 0:23:15,56
each contributing exactly half
the genes to each offspring.


391
0:23:15,56 --> 0:23:19,8
Many animals devote enormous energy
to displaying their attributes


392
0:23:19,8 --> 0:23:26,64
to would-be mates, signalling
they are fit and healthy specimens.


393
0:23:26,64 --> 0:23:28,8
They advertise through carrying
vivid plumage,


394
0:23:28,8 --> 0:23:33,28
vast antlers and horns,
or an outsize tail.


395
0:23:33,28 --> 0:23:44,56
You might think of it
as nature's bling.


396
0:23:44,56 --> 0:23:50,0
Humans also do this, just sometimes
in a more roundabout way.


397
0:23:50,0 --> 0:23:56,16
Dances like the tango, for example,
are courtship rituals in human form.


398
0:23:56,16 --> 0:24:1,8
Darwinian theory is really
a sort of branch of economics.


399
0:24:1,8 --> 0:24:3,88
You might think that the
two sexes are kind of equal,


400
0:24:3,88 --> 0:24:7,8
they both have the same amount
to gain from mating.


401
0:24:7,8 --> 0:24:9,52
Not so.


402
0:24:9,52 --> 0:24:12,92
The goods that a female mammal
brings to the deal are her womb,


403
0:24:12,92 --> 0:24:17,4
time devoted to the baby inside it,
and milk to feed it.


404
0:24:17,4 --> 0:24:20,12
The male generally provides
protection and food.


405
0:24:20,12 --> 0:24:22,48
So far, so good.


406
0:24:22,48 --> 0:24:25,92
But the male and female have very
different genetic interests,


407
0:24:25,92 --> 0:24:28,56
which is where it gets interesting.


408
0:24:28,56 --> 0:24:32,4
The male has the most to gain, by,
if he can,


409
0:24:32,4 --> 0:24:34,76
persuading lots of females
to mate with him


410
0:24:34,76 --> 0:24:37,28
and leaving each one
to fend for herself.


411
0:24:37,28 --> 0:24:40,68
The female has the most to gain
from persuading one male


412
0:24:40,68 --> 0:24:42,84
to be loyal to her, faithful to her,


413
0:24:42,84 --> 0:24:47,76
and to provide a full economic
upbringing for her offspring.


414
0:24:47,76 --> 0:24:51,84
It's this constant economic
tussle between the sexes


415
0:24:51,84 --> 0:24:55,76
which makes courtship so important.


416
0:24:55,76 --> 0:24:57,72
There's a lot at stake.


417
0:24:57,72 --> 0:25:1,2
The male tries to ensure that
the female is faithful,


418
0:25:1,2 --> 0:25:3,96
so he doesn't bring up another
male's child


419
0:25:3,96 --> 0:25:6,4
and perpetuate another male's
genes.


420
0:25:6,4 --> 0:25:10,32
The female must be faithful,
or at least appear to be,


421
0:25:10,32 --> 0:25:12,32
or the male may abandon her


422
0:25:12,32 --> 0:25:15,32
and force her to bring up
the offspring on her own.


423
0:25:15,32 --> 0:25:18,84
So one key characteristic
we see being displayed


424
0:25:18,84 --> 0:25:23,92
in animal courtship is what
we humans would call jealousy.


425
0:25:23,92 --> 0:25:27,92
Females will tend to be coy
and will tend to advertise


426
0:25:27,92 --> 0:25:32,32
their fidelity, advertise
their faithfulness to the male.


427
0:25:32,32 --> 0:25:35,44
Males, on the other hand, will tend
to go in for mate guarding.


428
0:25:35,44 --> 0:25:42,2
Say, putting an arm round a woman
at a social gathering.


429
0:25:42,2 --> 0:25:46,44
So evolutionary science shows
you don't need religion


430
0:25:46,44 --> 0:25:49,56
to have order and even courtesy
in relationships.


431
0:25:49,56 --> 0:25:53,4
It's not just anything goes
and sex in the street.


432
0:25:53,4 --> 0:26:1,96
That's been tried in the past,
with odd results.


433
0:26:1,96 --> 0:26:6,4
Well, I think what's happening
in San Francisco is the only


434
0:26:6,4 --> 0:26:9,2
meaningful thing that's happening
in this country


435
0:26:9,2 --> 0:26:12,8
and quite possibly the world.


436
0:26:12,8 --> 0:26:15,96
In the 1960s,
the San Francisco Bay area


437
0:26:15,96 --> 0:26:19,64
was at the heart of the hippy
experiment in so-called free love.


438
0:26:19,64 --> 0:26:23,4
I remember it well,
because I was there.


439
0:26:23,4 --> 0:26:28,4
Well, this is Telegraph Avenue,
which used to be filled


440
0:26:28,4 --> 0:26:31,72
with street people selling beads
and carpets and drugs and things.


441
0:26:31,72 --> 0:26:34,88
Can't see any sign of that
activity today,


442
0:26:34,88 --> 0:26:36,52
but possibly it's just because


443
0:26:36,52 --> 0:26:38,56
it's only about nine o'clock
in the morning.


444
0:26:38,56 --> 0:26:41,28
Probably haven't got up yet.


445
0:26:41,28 --> 0:26:44,24
I used to live here
in the late 1960s.


446
0:26:44,24 --> 0:26:48,24
I was a very junior faculty member
at the University Of California.


447
0:26:48,24 --> 0:26:50,52
And it was a time of great
political unrest,


448
0:26:50,52 --> 0:26:52,32
it was the time of the Vietnam War.


449
0:26:52,32 --> 0:26:56,0
There was tear gas,
there were riot police,


450
0:26:56,0 --> 0:26:59,56
the National Guard, bayonets.


451
0:26:59,56 --> 0:27:1,4
CHANTING


452
0:27:1,4 --> 0:27:4,84
Part of the rebellion against
authority came in


453
0:27:4,84 --> 0:27:7,64
trying to throw off
sexual inhibitions.


454
0:27:7,64 --> 0:27:12,8
Coyness and mate guarding were out.


455
0:27:12,8 --> 0:27:15,68
The sexual culture was pretty free.
Rather shockingly so.


456
0:27:15,68 --> 0:27:18,2
I remember once walking down
this very street,


457
0:27:18,2 --> 0:27:21,92
and there was a young man walking
ahead of me, a sort of hippy type,


458
0:27:21,92 --> 0:27:25,8
and every young woman
who came towards him,


459
0:27:25,8 --> 0:27:28,88
he would just reach out
and feel her breast.


460
0:27:28,88 --> 0:27:32,76
And then just walk on. And she
took not the slightest notice.


461
0:27:32,76 --> 0:27:37,44
Another time, I saw a young woman in
Telegraph Avenue completely naked.


462
0:27:37,44 --> 0:27:39,8
That is a very clear memory.


463
0:27:39,8 --> 0:27:45,4
It definitely happened.


464
0:27:45,4 --> 0:27:49,8
But that '60s culture of letting it
all hang out didn't last.


465
0:27:49,8 --> 0:27:54,92
I'm intrigued by why
all that's left today are tourists,


466
0:27:54,92 --> 0:28:4,2
grizzled street sellers
and dirty needles in the park.


467
0:28:4,2 --> 0:28:6,72
Perhaps the answer lies, once again,


468
0:28:6,72 --> 0:28:10,4
in understanding our evolution
as a species.


469
0:28:10,4 --> 0:28:14,52
Science suggests that the rules
we've evolved around courtship


470
0:28:14,52 --> 0:28:19,4
and sex are attached to deep-rooted
emotions and reactions


471
0:28:19,4 --> 0:28:20,56
that are hard to jettison overnight.


472
0:28:20,56 --> 0:28:22,6
(SNIFFS THEN GAGS)


473
0:28:22,6 --> 0:28:24,28
This is the reaction that I have.


474
0:28:24,28 --> 0:28:26,68
These are crabs that are used
for seasoning.


475
0:28:26,68 --> 0:28:31,92
'The man assaulting my senses
is the psychologist David Pizarro.'


476
0:28:31,92 --> 0:28:35,4
Oh, my God!
That makes me want to retch.


477
0:28:35,4 --> 0:28:40,16
'He is studying the science
of disgust.'


478
0:28:40,16 --> 0:28:42,84
This is from the film, Trainspotting.


479
0:28:42,84 --> 0:28:48,52
Aptly titled the worst toilet
in Scotland.


480
0:28:48,52 --> 0:28:56,12
Yuck!


481
0:28:56,12 --> 0:28:57,52
FLATULENCE


482
0:28:57,52 --> 0:28:59,76
MOANING


483
0:28:59,76 --> 0:29:2,92
That's horrible.


484
0:29:2,92 --> 0:29:5,68
OK, I've shown you a brief portion.


485
0:29:5,68 --> 0:29:8,4
I could see the disgust
in your face.


486
0:29:8,4 --> 0:29:10,84
But what if I were, say, to present
you with something like this.


487
0:29:10,84 --> 0:29:13,8
And I asked you to handle it
and maybe, uh...


488
0:29:13,8 --> 0:29:17,44
I won't ask you to put that
in your mouth, but...


489
0:29:17,44 --> 0:29:20,44
Well, I mean, I can kind of tell
that's a joke.


490
0:29:20,44 --> 0:29:23,36
This actually wouldn't worry me
all that much, I mean, I can see...


491
0:29:23,36 --> 0:29:25,68
You might trust that I wouldn't
put actual faeces.


492
0:29:25,68 --> 0:29:27,24
And as it turns out, this is soap.


493
0:29:27,24 --> 0:29:28,88
It's soap. So now you've told me,


494
0:29:28,88 --> 0:29:31,32
I wouldn't mind washing my hands
with that.


495
0:29:31,32 --> 0:29:34,56
So now I'm going to show you
a few other images.


496
0:29:34,56 --> 0:29:37,4
They're different from the first
ones I showed you.


497
0:29:37,4 --> 0:29:38,36
You'll see immediately why.


498
0:29:38,36 --> 0:29:39,8
Oh, God. Yes. Yes.


499
0:29:39,8 --> 0:29:41,72
'David Pizarro shows me


500
0:29:41,72 --> 0:29:44,28
'a highly graphic image
of three elderly men


501
0:29:44,28 --> 0:29:47,76
'engaged in homosexual sex.'


502
0:29:47,76 --> 0:29:49,72
Ugh!


503
0:29:49,72 --> 0:29:50,76
Oh, God!


504
0:29:50,76 --> 0:29:55,32
'Now I'm looking at a degrading
sexual act involving vomit.'


505
0:29:55,32 --> 0:29:58,0
I'll leave this at two,
because these are actually


506
0:29:58,0 --> 0:30:0,84
so disgusting that I feel bad
having shown them to you.


507
0:30:0,84 --> 0:30:3,52
Those two images were images
of a sexual nature,


508
0:30:3,52 --> 0:30:5,72
and as it turns out,
the domain of sex


509
0:30:5,72 --> 0:30:10,16
is one in which we are
easily disgusted.


510
0:30:10,16 --> 0:30:12,4
'The "Yuck!" reaction
is an emotion


511
0:30:12,4 --> 0:30:15,28
'that almost certainly evolved
to help us survive,


512
0:30:15,28 --> 0:30:19,96
'to make us back off from
potential disease.


513
0:30:19,96 --> 0:30:22,8
'But what's fascinating is how
disgust seems to have been


514
0:30:22,8 --> 0:30:28,96
'harnessed to reinforce our sense
of judgement and moral disapproval.'


515
0:30:28,96 --> 0:30:32,2
I kept finding that responses
to questions like


516
0:30:32,2 --> 0:30:34,8
"How disgusted would you be if you
were to walk into a public restroom


517
0:30:34,8 --> 0:30:36,44
"and found an unflushed toilet?"


518
0:30:36,44 --> 0:30:39,52
were consistently correlated
with political orientation.


519
0:30:39,52 --> 0:30:42,88
The more likely you are to be
disgusted in everyday life,


520
0:30:42,88 --> 0:30:45,52
the more likely you are to hold
attitudes,


521
0:30:45,52 --> 0:30:47,64
in the sexual domain especially,


522
0:30:47,64 --> 0:30:52,4
that are moral beliefs against,
for instance,


523
0:30:52,4 --> 0:30:54,56
the behaviour of two men having sex.


524
0:30:54,56 --> 0:30:56,84
Yes, let me ask a question
about that,


525
0:30:56,84 --> 0:30:59,88
because I had a fairly strong
disgust reaction


526
0:30:59,88 --> 0:31:2,28
to some of the things you showed,


527
0:31:2,28 --> 0:31:5,52
but the important difference
is that I don't try to impose


528
0:31:5,52 --> 0:31:8,96
my own dislikes on what
other people are allowed to do.


529
0:31:8,96 --> 0:31:12,24
It's nothing to do with me
what people do in private.


530
0:31:12,24 --> 0:31:14,52
I think that's the crucial
distinction.


531
0:31:14,52 --> 0:31:18,88
But it is a very common thought
in moral codes across the world


532
0:31:18,88 --> 0:31:23,68
that many things are wrong by dint
of their being somehow impure.


533
0:31:23,68 --> 0:31:26,88
I think that the real answer here
comes from the fact that


534
0:31:26,88 --> 0:31:30,48
we can now actually see
what is harmful and what is not,


535
0:31:30,48 --> 0:31:33,48
and we can decide to put our disgust
to rest


536
0:31:33,48 --> 0:31:35,84
when it comes to making
moral judgements.


537
0:31:35,84 --> 0:31:39,72
And one of the things that I ask
my students in my class is,


538
0:31:39,72 --> 0:31:43,12
imagine two very, very ugly people
having sex.


539
0:31:43,12 --> 0:31:44,8
Disgusting.


540
0:31:44,8 --> 0:31:49,4
But would you ever think to make it
illegal for ugly people to have sex?


541
0:31:49,4 --> 0:31:50,8
Well, of course not.


542
0:31:50,8 --> 0:31:53,56
Well, maybe it's a case in which
we might be able to say,


543
0:31:53,56 --> 0:31:56,32
you know what? I'm grossed out
by what you're doing,


544
0:31:56,32 --> 0:31:57,84
but that has nothing to do with


545
0:31:57,84 --> 0:32:3,32
whether you should be put
in prison for it.


546
0:32:3,32 --> 0:32:5,2
This is the key point.


547
0:32:5,2 --> 0:32:8,32
We have instincts that used to
protect our primitive ancestors.


548
0:32:8,32 --> 0:32:14,4
Because of that, we may still find
some things emotionally repellent.


549
0:32:14,4 --> 0:32:16,12
But we have evolved also
a sense of reason,


550
0:32:16,12 --> 0:32:21,6
which curbs our tendency to project
our disgust onto other people.


551
0:32:21,6 --> 0:32:23,64
In our post-religion world,


552
0:32:23,64 --> 0:32:27,68
we can look rationally at what
we once called sinful behaviour.


553
0:32:27,68 --> 0:32:35,8
We can weigh up actual harms and
benefits, and temper our instincts.


554
0:32:35,8 --> 0:32:39,16
In this way, advanced societies
like ours can move on,


555
0:32:39,16 --> 0:32:45,76
shifting the line on what is deemed
right or wrong.


556
0:32:45,76 --> 0:32:49,72
Probably the dominant change
in my lifetime


557
0:32:49,72 --> 0:32:51,8
is the change in attitude
towards gays.


558
0:32:51,8 --> 0:32:57,36
When I first entered Parliament in
1979, I started campaigning


559
0:32:57,36 --> 0:32:58,68
not for equal rights -


560
0:32:58,68 --> 0:33:2,12
we wouldn't have dared use
a word like equal rights -


561
0:33:2,12 --> 0:33:6,8
but I started campaigning for a
measure of respect for homosexuals.


562
0:33:6,8 --> 0:33:10,44
I thought, if I was very lucky,
we might get the age of consent


563
0:33:10,44 --> 0:33:14,44
reduced from 21 to 18
by the time I died.


564
0:33:14,44 --> 0:33:15,8
I thought, if I was very lucky,


565
0:33:15,8 --> 0:33:17,76
I could stop the police
impersonating gays


566
0:33:17,76 --> 0:33:21,12
in order to pick people up in public
lavatories and then prosecute them.


567
0:33:21,12 --> 0:33:23,56
These things seem to change
so slowly, and then suddenly,


568
0:33:23,56 --> 0:33:26,76
like an avalanche,
everything changed


569
0:33:26,76 --> 0:33:28,56
and long before the end of my life.


570
0:33:28,56 --> 0:33:33,2
I cannot believe the speed with
what seemed to be a really fixed


571
0:33:33,2 --> 0:33:37,56
public loathing of homosexuality has
changed to a shrug of the shoulders.


572
0:33:37,56 --> 0:33:39,64
public loathing of homosexuality has
changed to a shrug of the shoulders.
Yes.


573
0:33:39,64 --> 0:33:43,48
'Matthew Parris believes
it is our capacity for reason


574
0:33:43,48 --> 0:33:46,84
'that lies behind this growing
tolerance.'


575
0:33:46,84 --> 0:33:49,48
In our culture,
the advance of science,


576
0:33:49,48 --> 0:33:53,48
the advance of scientific,
medical, psychological knowledge,


577
0:33:53,48 --> 0:33:57,72
the understanding that things
are not rooted in sin


578
0:33:57,72 --> 0:33:59,64
that comes from demons and the devil,


579
0:33:59,64 --> 0:34:4,2
but rooted in very deep internal
aspects of our own...


580
0:34:4,2 --> 0:34:6,24
the mechanisms of our mind.


581
0:34:6,24 --> 0:34:10,32
So blame is much less important
in these things,


582
0:34:10,32 --> 0:34:14,4
and, of course, illnesses used to be
attributed sometimes to sin too.


583
0:34:14,4 --> 0:34:16,88
Well, it isn't a matter of sin,
it isn't a matter blame.


584
0:34:16,88 --> 0:34:18,36
And I think those attitudes


585
0:34:18,36 --> 0:34:20,8
have probably been changing
over 200 years,


586
0:34:20,8 --> 0:34:24,8
and the change has accelerated
in the last century.


587
0:34:24,8 --> 0:34:27,4
'It seems like a wonderfully
positive story.


588
0:34:27,4 --> 0:34:30,0
'But Matthew Parris does have
concerns.'


589
0:34:30,0 --> 0:34:32,24
..They're getting...
Well, what shall we say?


590
0:34:32,24 --> 0:34:34,8
..more liberal,
more tolerant.


591
0:34:34,8 --> 0:34:37,24
What you and I would think of
as better.


592
0:34:37,24 --> 0:34:39,4
We are actually getting better.


593
0:34:39,4 --> 0:34:43,52
I suppose, though, that a fear
that certainly haunts me


594
0:34:43,52 --> 0:34:46,4
and others in the gay liberation
movement


595
0:34:46,4 --> 0:34:49,16
is that if things could swing
so rapidly in our favour


596
0:34:49,16 --> 0:34:54,16
as they have, could we, in a sort
of Third Reich-like world,


597
0:34:54,16 --> 0:34:57,84
see things swinging very rapidly,
equally rapidly the other way?


598
0:34:57,84 --> 0:34:58,6
A backlash.


599
0:34:58,6 --> 0:35:2,2
A backlash.
How little anchored, perhaps,
are these categories.


600
0:35:2,2 --> 0:35:3,4
Yes.


601
0:35:3,4 --> 0:35:4,44
CHANTING


602
0:35:4,44 --> 0:35:8,12
There's a sort of feeling of hatred
for bankers, for rich people,


603
0:35:8,12 --> 0:35:11,0
for plutocrats, at the moment.
I could imagine a little winter,


604
0:35:11,0 --> 0:35:14,52
a little ice age for the richest
in society coming


605
0:35:14,52 --> 0:35:17,32
as the Western economy sinks,


606
0:35:17,32 --> 0:35:19,28
and as people are looking
for somebody to blame,


607
0:35:19,28 --> 0:35:27,64
just as the Jews got it in the neck,
so to speak, between the two wars.


608
0:35:27,64 --> 0:35:31,52
I understand what Matthew Parris
is getting at,


609
0:35:31,52 --> 0:35:35,32
but I think I'm more optimistic
about human nature.


610
0:35:35,32 --> 0:35:38,88
I want to argue that,
now we've left religion behind,


611
0:35:38,88 --> 0:35:52,28
we're getting better,
more moral, and kinder.


612
0:35:52,28 --> 0:35:56,32
'If you want to understand what
makes a human being good,


613
0:35:56,32 --> 0:35:59,2
'watch them with a pet.


614
0:35:59,2 --> 0:36:1,68
'Tiko is a wolf,
or he thinks he's a wolf.


615
0:36:1,68 --> 0:36:5,68
'His not very distant
ancestors were wolves.'


616
0:36:5,68 --> 0:36:7,0
Good dog, Tiko.


617
0:36:7,0 --> 0:36:10,48
'He loves going for a walk because
he sees what happened overnight,


618
0:36:10,48 --> 0:36:13,16
'which he can tell
from the smells that were left.'


619
0:36:13,16 --> 0:36:14,52
Come on, Tiko.


620
0:36:14,52 --> 0:36:17,36
'He stops at every corner,
stops at every lamppost.


621
0:36:17,36 --> 0:36:23,8
'It's sort of like reading
the newspaper for him, I think.'


622
0:36:23,8 --> 0:36:27,48
Off we go.


623
0:36:27,48 --> 0:36:31,12
It's a very different world
to be in, a dog's world,


624
0:36:31,12 --> 0:36:33,12
and we anthropomorphise,


625
0:36:33,12 --> 0:36:35,0
we put ourselves in the position
of the dog,


626
0:36:35,0 --> 0:36:38,68
project ourselves
into the body of the dog


627
0:36:38,68 --> 0:36:43,4
and we think we know what
it's like to be a dog, and we don't.


628
0:36:43,4 --> 0:36:44,8
We delude ourselves.


629
0:36:44,8 --> 0:36:51,68
But that's part of what goes on
when we love a dog.


630
0:36:51,68 --> 0:36:53,92
Tiko, do you like going to
puppy class?


631
0:36:53,92 --> 0:36:56,92
Do you?
And do you play with Figgy?


632
0:36:56,92 --> 0:36:58,88
And do you play with Denis?
Do you?


633
0:36:58,88 --> 0:37:0,76
'What am I doing with my dog?'


634
0:37:0,76 --> 0:37:3,52
Do you play with Watson?


635
0:37:3,52 --> 0:37:5,8
'I'm empathising,


636
0:37:5,8 --> 0:37:8,4
'I'm making an imaginative leap
to see the world


637
0:37:8,4 --> 0:37:10,24
'from a dog's perspective.'


638
0:37:10,24 --> 0:37:11,52
Paw.


639
0:37:11,52 --> 0:37:12,64
Good boy.


640
0:37:12,64 --> 0:37:16,8
'Humans are extraordinarily good
at identifying with other humans


641
0:37:16,8 --> 0:37:18,72
'and other species.


642
0:37:18,72 --> 0:37:22,44
'And it has a profoundly
moral effect.'


643
0:37:22,44 --> 0:37:26,6
When we see a dog or a person
suffering, we suffer, too.


644
0:37:26,6 --> 0:37:30,52
We suffer vicariously,
it's a very powerful emotion.


645
0:37:30,52 --> 0:37:35,2
If I see Tiko suffering,
if he's ill, in pain,


646
0:37:35,2 --> 0:37:36,84
I feel devastated.


647
0:37:36,84 --> 0:37:42,8
It's exactly as though
it was my own child, I suppose.


648
0:37:42,8 --> 0:37:43,88
Tiko, uppity-paw.


649
0:37:43,88 --> 0:37:46,72
Empathy is important for morality


650
0:37:46,72 --> 0:37:50,48
because perhaps the most fundamental
principle of morality,


651
0:37:50,48 --> 0:37:54,52
the golden rule, involves putting
yourself in the position of another.


652
0:37:54,52 --> 0:37:56,8
Do as you would be done by.


653
0:37:56,8 --> 0:38:3,2
How would you like it
if you were treated like that?


654
0:38:3,2 --> 0:38:5,68
We don't need God
telling us the rule.


655
0:38:5,68 --> 0:38:8,2
Science shows
we humans are hardwired


656
0:38:8,2 --> 0:38:11,8
to have empathy.


657
0:38:11,8 --> 0:38:14,88
Scientists can now scan which
parts of the brain register


658
0:38:14,88 --> 0:38:17,52
vicarious pain or pleasure.


659
0:38:17,52 --> 0:38:19,12
They can track how hormones,


660
0:38:19,12 --> 0:38:22,48
like oxytocin, which encourage
compassion and nurturing,


661
0:38:22,48 --> 0:38:30,12
act on the emotion systems
in the brain.


662
0:38:30,12 --> 0:38:34,44
Brain science helps us to see why
we find it a bad idea to steal,


663
0:38:34,44 --> 0:38:38,24
why we hate to see somebody
kicking a dog.


664
0:38:38,24 --> 0:38:42,32
We can trace the chemicals
in the brain that reward kindness.


665
0:38:42,32 --> 0:38:47,28
We can see what goes on in the brain
when we feel for others.


666
0:38:47,28 --> 0:38:49,88
Goodness is natural to us.


667
0:38:49,88 --> 0:38:59,16
Kindness is in our physiology.


668
0:38:59,16 --> 0:39:2,36
So, you might ask, quite rightly,


669
0:39:2,36 --> 0:39:8,28
if humans have this innate capacity
for good, why does it go wrong?


670
0:39:8,28 --> 0:39:11,12
Why do we still do bad things?


671
0:39:11,12 --> 0:39:15,84
Perhaps there's a scientific
answer to that, too.


672
0:39:15,84 --> 0:39:18,92
Here, we go back to those
primitive moral emotions


673
0:39:18,92 --> 0:39:21,84
that helped us survive.


674
0:39:21,84 --> 0:39:23,4
You've got empathy,


675
0:39:23,4 --> 0:39:26,64
you've got kindness,
you've got nurturing,


676
0:39:26,64 --> 0:39:28,56
you've got all of this,


677
0:39:28,56 --> 0:39:31,4
but you also have disgust,
cruelty, fear.


678
0:39:31,4 --> 0:39:36,52
All of those are evolved
to protect you and your kin.


679
0:39:36,52 --> 0:39:40,32
The neuroscientist Kathleen Taylor
has studied what happens


680
0:39:40,32 --> 0:39:44,0
when people decide that others
are not included in their tribe.


681
0:39:44,0 --> 0:39:47,56
She calls it "otherisation".


682
0:39:47,56 --> 0:39:51,72
The others are commonly
classed as beasts or subhuman.


683
0:39:51,72 --> 0:39:56,28
You're not just saying that's my
enemy, you're actually saying,


684
0:39:56,28 --> 0:40:0,12
that is a less than human person,
I am not going to call that person


685
0:40:0,12 --> 0:40:3,64
the same moral status as I would
to my nearest and dearest.


686
0:40:3,64 --> 0:40:7,4
Those who carried out the final
solution in Nazi Germany


687
0:40:7,4 --> 0:40:10,44
could only have done it, presumably,
by otherisation of the Jews?


688
0:40:10,44 --> 0:40:15,16
Yes, because one of the things that
it does is, it suppresses empathy.


689
0:40:15,16 --> 0:40:18,6
So, for example, the groups
who were committing the worst


690
0:40:18,6 --> 0:40:21,72
atrocities on the Eastern Front in
the Second World War,


691
0:40:21,72 --> 0:40:22,8
they're not just


692
0:40:22,8 --> 0:40:26,76
forgetting about morality altogether
and just engaging in cruelty.


693
0:40:26,76 --> 0:40:29,64
Their cruelty is very targeted
and very directed


694
0:40:29,64 --> 0:40:34,36
and people who are part of their
group escape cruelty, on the whole.


695
0:40:34,36 --> 0:40:38,16
And people who are not part
of their group are the ones who


696
0:40:38,16 --> 0:40:39,28
bear the brunt of it.


697
0:40:39,28 --> 0:40:42,28
But even in the times of horror,
there are moments


698
0:40:42,28 --> 0:40:47,4
which should be cherished
where empathy breaks through.


699
0:40:47,4 --> 0:40:52,32
There's an interesting example
from the SS of a man who is helping


700
0:40:52,32 --> 0:40:55,36
to dispose, as they put it,
of some Jewish children.


701
0:40:55,36 --> 0:40:57,28
His parents had already been killed.


702
0:40:57,28 --> 0:40:59,48
And he talks about how
he was doing it,


703
0:40:59,48 --> 0:41:1,44
and he had to take the hand
of a little girl


704
0:41:1,44 --> 0:41:3,84
and he just couldn't do it.
His empathy came back.


705
0:41:3,84 --> 0:41:6,92
It overwhelmed him,
so he's got a lot of ideology,


706
0:41:6,92 --> 0:41:9,72
a lot of group pressure saying
these people are not human,


707
0:41:9,72 --> 0:41:12,72
you will not treat them as human,
but it's obvious that


708
0:41:12,72 --> 0:41:15,76
if the cues are sufficiently
powerful, if you like,


709
0:41:15,76 --> 0:41:19,4
that can go,
that can be reversed.


710
0:41:19,4 --> 0:41:21,84
He was on his own for a little
while, with this little girl,


711
0:41:21,84 --> 0:41:23,2
and suddenly he was a dad...


712
0:41:23,2 --> 0:41:23,64
He realised he was human.


713
0:41:23,64 --> 0:41:30,24
He realised he was human.
Yeah.


714
0:41:30,24 --> 0:41:33,8
If we are to build
a non-religious morality,


715
0:41:33,8 --> 0:41:36,36
one thing we must strenuously
avoid is demonising


716
0:41:36,36 --> 0:41:40,48
another set of humans,
or treating them as unequal.


717
0:41:40,48 --> 0:41:45,88
Quite apart from anything else,
this leads to a collapse of empathy.


718
0:41:45,88 --> 0:41:49,68
What we need to do is expand
the circle of those to whom


719
0:41:49,68 --> 0:41:51,44
we feel empathy.


720
0:41:51,44 --> 0:41:54,2
Break down the barriers
that divide us,


721
0:41:54,2 --> 0:41:59,92
the tribalisms of religion,
class, race and ideology.


722
0:41:59,92 --> 0:42:3,4
Our scientific
understanding of empathy,


723
0:42:3,4 --> 0:42:7,44
and the memory of how we've got it
wrong in the past, can help.


724
0:42:7,44 --> 0:42:10,28
And the good news is,
we're already doing it.


725
0:42:10,28 --> 0:42:15,96
200 years ago, it was normal,
acceptable, to keep slaves.


726
0:42:15,96 --> 0:42:18,8
Now, it would
be considered barbaric.


727
0:42:18,8 --> 0:42:20,28
The same with racism.


728
0:42:20,28 --> 0:42:23,8
I was brought up in British
colonial Africa,


729
0:42:23,8 --> 0:42:26,36
and I vividly remember the
patronising attitude at the time.


730
0:42:26,36 --> 0:42:29,56
The Africans are like children,
they can't look after themselves.


731
0:42:29,56 --> 0:42:31,32
We have to do it for them.


732
0:42:31,32 --> 0:42:35,0
Today, such an attitude
would be unthinkable.


733
0:42:35,0 --> 0:42:38,68
Our capacity for empathy,
together with a more rational,


734
0:42:38,68 --> 0:42:41,76
tolerant society, is, I believe,


735
0:42:41,76 --> 0:42:47,56
making us more moral
than ever before.


736
0:42:47,56 --> 0:42:52,0
And yet, if you were to believe some
moralists and some newspapers,


737
0:42:52,0 --> 0:42:56,0
society is going to hell
in a handcart.


738
0:42:56,0 --> 0:42:58,96
But is it?


739
0:42:58,96 --> 0:43:2,84
The psychologist Steven Pinker has
looked at the figures in detail,


740
0:43:2,84 --> 0:43:7,64
including data from the British Home
Office and the US Bureau of Justice,


741
0:43:7,64 --> 0:43:15,2
and found that as religion declines,
we're becoming ever more civilised.


742
0:43:15,2 --> 0:43:17,56
I had no idea that, say,
in the last 40 years,


743
0:43:17,56 --> 0:43:19,92
the rate of rape had declined by 80%.


744
0:43:19,92 --> 0:43:21,12
80%?!


745
0:43:21,12 --> 0:43:22,72
80% in the United States.


746
0:43:22,72 --> 0:43:25,84
The rate of domestic abuse
in both the UK and the US...


747
0:43:25,84 --> 0:43:27,92
That rape figure is even
more surprising,


748
0:43:27,92 --> 0:43:30,64
because presumably the number
of reportings has gone up.


749
0:43:30,64 --> 0:43:32,36
Exactly. That's right.


750
0:43:32,36 --> 0:43:36,8
Child abuse has gone down,
attitudes towards racial minorities,


751
0:43:36,8 --> 0:43:40,64
attitudes towards homosexuals,
treatment of animals in laboratories.


752
0:43:40,64 --> 0:43:43,68
Yet the perception of these things
has gone in the other direction,


753
0:43:43,68 --> 0:43:47,64
because everybody thinks that child
abuse has been climbing.


754
0:43:47,64 --> 0:43:50,72
It may be because
of the increased concern


755
0:43:50,72 --> 0:43:54,32
that we both think that it's more
prevalent than ever before,


756
0:43:54,32 --> 0:43:57,56
and we've managed to put it down
because people care about it,


757
0:43:57,56 --> 0:44:0,6
take steps to minimise it
and those steps clearly succeed.


758
0:44:0,6 --> 0:44:5,48
And there are many positive
developments that we take for granted


759
0:44:5,48 --> 0:44:9,44
because they are non-events,
they're dogs that don't bark.


760
0:44:9,44 --> 0:44:13,88
An example would be the disappearance
of war between developed states.


761
0:44:13,88 --> 0:44:16,16
Even in the developing world,


762
0:44:16,16 --> 0:44:19,84
where we think of as a war-torn
hell-hole,


763
0:44:19,84 --> 0:44:24,12
the numbers show that the number
of wars and the numbers of deaths


764
0:44:24,12 --> 0:44:27,4
in war have plummeted worldwide
in the last 20 years,


765
0:44:27,4 --> 0:44:29,24
since the end of the Cold War.


766
0:44:29,24 --> 0:44:31,28
Deaths are lower in absolute numbers.


767
0:44:31,28 --> 0:44:33,2
In a world of seven billion people,


768
0:44:33,2 --> 0:44:37,52
fewer people are dying in warfare
than ever before.


769
0:44:37,52 --> 0:44:39,36
Are we too down on ourselves?


770
0:44:39,36 --> 0:44:41,84
Do you think that, actually,
we're becoming more moral?


771
0:44:41,84 --> 0:44:44,36
I don't know if we're becoming
more moral biologically,


772
0:44:44,36 --> 0:44:49,0
but I think there is something
about a society with free speech,


773
0:44:49,0 --> 0:44:51,8
with open enquiry,
with rational debate,


774
0:44:51,8 --> 0:44:53,84
with the accumulation of evidence,


775
0:44:53,84 --> 0:44:56,6
that will tend to push us
in a moral direction.


776
0:44:56,6 --> 0:45:0,12
In particular, the whole current
that we call humanism,


777
0:45:0,12 --> 0:45:4,96
which almost sounds banal
and boring and treacly nowadays,


778
0:45:4,96 --> 0:45:7,76
simply because it's
become second nature to us,


779
0:45:7,76 --> 0:45:18,44
but I think it's a radical
idea in human history.


780
0:45:18,44 --> 0:45:21,96
A cynic about human nature might
say that religious morality


781
0:45:21,96 --> 0:45:25,48
is an effective way
of keeping people in line.


782
0:45:25,48 --> 0:45:28,56
The threat of hell,
the reward of heaven.


783
0:45:28,56 --> 0:45:34,44
But the rules of the holy books
are out of date and often barbaric.


784
0:45:34,44 --> 0:45:38,96
Science shows that we're governed
by quite logical hidden rules


785
0:45:38,96 --> 0:45:42,0
and customs, and the highly
evolved senses that humans


786
0:45:42,0 --> 0:45:44,88
have, of reason and empathy.


787
0:45:44,88 --> 0:45:48,2
More important,
we now live in a rational age


788
0:45:48,2 --> 0:45:51,16
and can look at where
we've gone wrong in history,


789
0:45:51,16 --> 0:45:56,52
and avoid the tribalism that divides
and harms us.


790
0:45:56,52 --> 0:45:59,48
This, surely, is real progress.


791
0:45:59,48 --> 0:46:2,8
We live in what may be
a more peaceful,


792
0:46:2,8 --> 0:46:4,8
more civilised world
than ever before.


793
0:46:4,8 --> 0:46:8,36
We have the opportunity
to develop a new morality,


794
0:46:8,36 --> 0:46:21,0
and that is an exciting part
of what it means to be human.


795
0:46:21,0 --> 0:46:26,2
In the next programme -
the meaning of life.


796
0:46:26,2 --> 0:46:29,36
What's the point
if this life is all there is?


797
0:46:29,36 --> 0:46:56,32
Why does an atheist
get up in the morning?


798
0:46:56,32 --> 0:48:56,32
