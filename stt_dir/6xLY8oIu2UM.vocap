###22 JASON CROMBIE: Hi, I'm Jason Crombie.
###23 And today I'm going to meet a guy called Itsi who's New
###26 York's only Segway instructor.
###29 He's going to teach me how to ride a Segway.
###31 And I'm also going to meet the people from the New York City
###34 Jedi Academy.
###36 And they're going to teach me how to handle a lightsaber.
###38 And then, when I'm good at both of those things, I'm
###42 going to fight somebody on a Segway with a lightsaber.
###45 ITSI ATKINS: Show the girls.
###46 No, come on--
###48 it's not about your breasts, it's about--
###50 GABI: The balance?
###50 ITSI ATKINS: It's about the balance center.
###51 See-- this is the headline, from here to here.
###53 So directly middle of the headline is the maximum force.
###56 It's kind of like the pyramid structure, where the Earth
###60 brings the energy from the pyramids.
###63 Actually, chest out, and you'll pull forward, see?
###66 JASON CROMBIE: Oh, just leaning forward, is that it?
###67 ITSI ATKINS: That's it.
###68 JASON CROMBIE: Oh.
###69 ITSI ATKINS: Now, let me tell you the real thing.
###70 JASON CROMBIE: Sorry, dude.
###71 ITSI ATKINS: Toes down, you'll go forward.
###72 Heels down, you'll go back.
###74 JASON CROMBIE: Oh, that's easy.
###75 That's easy.
###76 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): They're bloody dangerous.
###77 ITSI ATKINS: [INAUDIBLE].
###78 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Jesus.
###78 JASON CROMBIE: I'm going to get mauled by a
###79 cat in one of those.
###80 [INAUDIBLE].
###80 ITSI ATKINS: OK, let's go upstairs.
###82 I wanna wash my hands.
###83 Take a pee.
###85 JASON CROMBIE: I'm gonna give you your bag back.
###86 ITSI ATKINS: Here you go.
###87 OK.
###88 I design handbags.
###89 It's the Bush shoe-throwing handbag.
###91 
###100 AMY: No.
###101 ITSI ATKINS: Now stop.
###102 JASON CROMBIE: What's with the paddles?
###103 
###109 ITSI ATKINS: It's like a bullfight where you go by and
###111 you get paddled.
###112 And then, if you're not standing up straight, I go,
###114 stand up straight.
###115 And it's this whole choreography of--
###118 JASON CROMBIE: So now I know how to use a Segway, thanks to
###120 Itsi and his paddling.
###121 And now it's time for the New York Jedi guys to show me how
###125 to use a lightsaber.
###126 [LIGHTSABER NOISES]
###131 JEDI MALE 1: [INAUDIBLE], come on.
###132 Every idiot knows that pepper boards do not go on the floor.
###136 JEDI MALE 2: [INAUDIBLE]
###137 
###141 JEDI MALE 3: They can take a bit of a beating, and they can
###143 give one, too.
###144 FLYNN: You have the rebound, the follow-through,
###146 and then the lock.
###147 So let's try that.
###148 JASON CROMBIE: OK.
###149 FLYNN: Rebound.
###149 Follow-through.
###151 JASON CROMBIE: So they're actually touching--
###152 on the follow-through?
###153 FLYNN: Right, you actually don't have to touch.
###154 Like [INAUDIBLE], it's a stage company.
###156 JASON CROMBIE: OK.
###156 FLYNN: So if we miss, just keep on going to the next one.
###158 JASON CROMBIE: OK.
###159 FLYNN: So hit the rebound.
###159 And follow-through.
###162 Lock.
###163 So what I'm doing is I'm actually broadcasting to you,
###166 ah, I'm coming over here.
###168 That's part of stage combat.
###169 I'm broadcasting coming up here.
###170 I'm over here.
###171 JASON CROMBIE: Ah, gotcha.
###172 FLYNN: In real sword fighting--
###174 JASON CROMBIE: Yeah, you wouldn't do that,
###174 you'd just be like--
###175 FLYNN: No, I'd be like-- bang.
###176 JASON CROMBIE: Oh, see, you've already got me.
###179 I'm just singed.
###180 FLYNN: Mirror me, exactly what I'm doing.
###182 Right?
###183 So, now, we now have a word.
###187 In saber stage combat, this is known as the Flynn.
###190 It was not named after me.
###192 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): It's known as the Flynn?
###194 FLYNN: Yeah, exactly, Errol Flynn.
###195 So, while he's acting, he's like, Ah, I now have you where
###198 I want you, Vizzini .
###199 You're [INAUDIBLE].
###200 I'm going to kill you.
###201 Ha ha ha ha.
###202 [GIGGLING]
###203 FLYNN: Ha ha ha.
###204 See, the same thing happens with everybody.
###206 They all giggle.
###206 JASON CROMBIE: I'm really bad at this.
###209 JASON (OFFSCREEN): So I've figured out how to use the
###210 lightsaber and the Segway.
###212 So now I'm gonna marry the two, and we're gonna have the
###214 very first Saberseg battle.
###216 
###224 JASON CROMBIE: [INAUDIBLE].
###224 FLYNN: Ha ha!
###225 
###231 Oh!
###232 
###243 [MACHINERY SQUEALING]
###244 JASON CROMBIE: Whoa.
###244 ITSI ATKINS: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
###245 See what happens when you start fucking around?
###248 JASON CROMBIE: That was really scary.
###250 I thought my thing was gonna go.
###251 ITSI ATKINS: All right, I think you got enough.
###252 JASON (OFFSCREEN): I think that's it, yeah.
###254 FLYNN: I definitely haven't gotten enough.
###255
