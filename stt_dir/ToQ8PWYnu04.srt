RYAN DUFFY: Welcome to
Bogota, Colombia.


3
0:0:11,85 --> 0:0:13,98
We're here chasing after the
most dangerous drug in the


4
0:0:13,98 --> 0:0:16,42
world, burundanga.


5
0:0:16,42 --> 0:0:19,1
Burundanga is the source of
scopolamine, which is


6
0:0:19,1 --> 0:0:21,87
basically like the worst roofie
you can ever imagine


7
0:0:21,87 --> 0:0:23,17
times a million.


8
0:0:23,17 --> 0:0:26,45
You're at the whim of
suggestions like, hey, take me


9
0:0:26,45 --> 0:0:27,3
to your ATM.


10
0:0:27,3 --> 0:0:29,27
Hey, come with me to
the hotel room--


11
0:0:29,27 --> 0:0:31,6
while you're completely
conscious and articulate.


12
0:0:31,6 --> 0:0:41,23



13
0:0:41,23 --> 0:0:44,9
Apparently there is a lot of
different parts of the plant


14
0:0:44,9 --> 0:0:47,23
that are a bit dangerous,
possibly a bit fun, depending


15
0:0:47,23 --> 0:0:48,46
on what you're into.


16
0:0:48,46 --> 0:0:50,81
So we're going to be looking
for the tree, talking to


17
0:0:50,81 --> 0:0:53,77
people who've had experience
with it, and seeing if we can


18
0:0:53,77 --> 0:0:55,28
find some of the actual
drug ourselves.


19

0:1:0,28 --> 0:1:17,27
[MUSIC PLAYING]


21
0:1:17,27 --> 0:1:20,53
RYAN DUFFY: So the deal with
burundanga is that it pretty


22
0:1:20,53 --> 0:1:22,81
much eliminates your
free will.


23
0:1:22,81 --> 0:1:25,2
So you're awake and
you're articulate.


24
0:1:25,2 --> 0:1:27,76
And to anyone else watching
you, it seems like you're


25
0:1:27,76 --> 0:1:28,97
perfectly fine.


26
0:1:28,97 --> 0:1:31,67
But you've completely lost
control of your own actions.


27
0:1:31,67 --> 0:1:33,49
So you're at the whim
of suggestions.


28
0:1:33,49 --> 0:1:36,75
And that's how people take
advantage of you.


29
0:1:36,75 --> 0:1:39,61
I've heard a bunch of different
stories really


30
0:1:39,61 --> 0:1:41,6
running the gamut.


31
0:1:41,6 --> 0:1:43,81
Some of them sound like campfire
horror stories you're


32
0:1:43,81 --> 0:1:44,92
told when you're growing up.


33
0:1:44,92 --> 0:1:48,31
Stuff like, waking up in a
bathtub with an organ cut out


34
0:1:48,31 --> 0:1:49,76
and a sign saying, you
have five hours


35
0:1:49,76 --> 0:1:51,19
to get to the hospital.


36
0:1:51,19 --> 0:1:53,28
We've of course also heard
that it's used


37
0:1:53,28 --> 0:1:54,74
as a date rape drug.


38
0:1:54,74 --> 0:1:58,72
We heard one particularly
chilling story where a guy was


39
0:1:58,72 --> 0:2:2,19
taken back to his apartment,
woke up the next morning in an


40
0:2:2,19 --> 0:2:5,7
empty apartment completely
confused as to what happened.


41
0:2:5,7 --> 0:2:8,789
Went down and said to his door
man, you know, why is my


42
0:2:8,789 --> 0:2:9,789
apartment empty?


43
0:2:9,789 --> 0:2:11,7
What happened?


44
0:2:11,7 --> 0:2:13,5
The doorman said, well, you
brought it out with two of


45
0:2:13,5 --> 0:2:13,95
your friends last night.


46
0:2:13,95 --> 0:2:15,78
All your stuff, you loaded
it into a van.


47
0:2:15,78 --> 0:2:17,74
And the guy was like, why
in the hell would


48
0:2:17,74 --> 0:2:19,8
you let me do that?


49
0:2:19,8 --> 0:2:21,41
And he was like, because
you told me to.


50
0:2:21,41 --> 0:2:24,57
So that's kind of the stuff
we're dealing with here,


51
0:2:24,57 --> 0:2:29,29
complete elimination of free
will while still acting which


52
0:2:29,29 --> 0:2:32,46
is pretty much the scariest
shit I can imagine.

RYAN DUFFY: Columbia's
basically fucked.


57
0:3:48,4 --> 0:3:50,9
They had the longest running
guerrilla war in


58
0:3:50,9 --> 0:3:51,47
all of Latin America.


59

They've essentially been at
civil war for 60 years.


60

And really if you think about
it, they've never not been at

0:3:55,9 --> 0:3:58,29
war since they gained their
own independence.


62
0:3:58,29 --> 0:4:0,63
Other fun facts about Colombia,
definitely not from


63
0:4:0,63 --> 0:4:3,5
the Board of Tourism, include
the fact that one in every


64
0:4:3,5 --> 0:4:6,37
three kidnappings in the world
happen right here in Colombia.


65
0:4:6,37 --> 0:4:8,21

it's the cocaine

68
0:4:11,41 --> 0:4:33,69



69
0:4:33,69 --> 0:4:35,94
RYAN DUFFY: Now the borrachero
tree, which by the way roughly


70
0:4:35,94 --> 0:4:39,31
translates to drunken binge
tree, is indigenous to the


71
0:4:39,31 --> 0:4:40,49
Northern Andean region.


72
0:4:40,49 --> 0:4:43,6
That includes Colombia, and
Ecuador, Venezuela.


73
0:4:43,6 --> 0:4:45,72
But the scopolamine is really
only used by the criminal

In modern times, there's a

scopolamine for their benefit.


213
0:18:6,4 --> 0:18:9,63
For example, in the 1930s and
'40s, Josef Mengele had the

drug imported from Columbia to
Germany to use in some of his

interrogations.


216
0:18:14,31 --> 0:18:17,53
More recently, the CIA tried
to use the drug in the '60s


217
0:18:17,53 --> 0:18:20,2
during the Cold War as sort
of a truth serum.


218
0:18:20,2 --> 0:18:22,72
The problem with all of this is
that in addition to a whole

of hallucination involved.
