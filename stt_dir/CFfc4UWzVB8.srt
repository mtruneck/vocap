FEMALE SPEAKER: On the 1st of
May, the small Swedish town of


3
0:0:12,85 --> 0:0:15,665
Eskilstuna, one hour west
of Stockholm, went


4
0:0:15,665 --> 0:0:21,11
from this to this.

had chosen the sacred

and the city of Eskilstuna

This is did not go down well
with the left-wing kids, who

marches on their streets,


13

Day, which is a

huge deal in Sweden.

First of May for All and began

0:1:0,92 --> 0:1:4,56
planning a massive counter
demonstration.

as they started

more people joined Kim and his

friends in the
counter-demonstration, the


23
0:1:37,44 --> 0:1:39,12

gathering at their

0:1:39,12 --> 0:1:41,78
assigned meeting points.


25
0:1:41,78 --> 0:1:44,54
Despite supporters coming from
Norway and Germany, the


26
0:1:44,54 --> 0:1:46,732
turnout wasn't exactly
massive.

demonstration soon gained some


30
0:2:0,4 --> 0:2:2,16
unexpected momentum.


31
0:2:2,16 --> 0:2:4,44
They managed to form a blockade,
preventing half of


32

the nationalists from
joining their peers.


33
0:2:7,75 --> 0:2:10,579
The blocked nationalists
eventually managed to break


34
0:2:10,579 --> 0:2:13,33
away, marching straight into
a park where families were


35
0:2:13,33 --> 0:2:14,87
having picnics.


36
0:2:14,87 --> 0:2:16,57
Some kids from the
counter-demonstration

followed, throwing bottles
and rocks at them.


38
0:2:19,47 --> 0:2:22,28

off and trashed some poor

FEMALE SPEAKER: Then some
troublemakers started throwing


47
0:2:54,4 --> 0:2:56,71
rocks at the nationalists, and
it all erupted into violent


48
0:2:56,71 --> 0:2:59,61

people to hospital with


49
0:2:59,61 --> 0:3:0,86
cracked skulls.


50
0:3:0,86 --> 0:3:3,41



51
0:3:3,41 --> 0:3:6,48
After about an hour-long stand
off, the nationalists started


52
0:3:6,48 --> 0:3:8,47
marching, protected
by the police.


53
0:3:8,47 --> 0:3:12,97
But they were forced to take
an alternative route.


54
0:3:12,97 --> 0:3:14,9
The kids from the
counter-demonstration started


55
0:3:14,9 --> 0:3:17,832
running, taking a shortcut to
form another blockade further

0:3:17,832 --> 0:3:18,58
up the street.

0:3:18,58 --> 0:3:20,97

the riot police and their

from Stockholm and other

Realizing they wouldn't reach
their destination, the extreme

their speeches from the back

the nationalists gathered.

At 6:00 PM, their demonstration
permit ended,

back to their cars.

By then, extra police forces
from Stockholm and the

surrounding areas had arrived
and began mass searching the

forcing them into buses.
