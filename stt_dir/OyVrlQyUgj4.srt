The next morning, she's gone.


388
0:25:8,792 --> 0:25:10,25
Yeah, but she's the only person


389
0:25:10,25 --> 0:25:12,83
who's had a proper look
at the killer.


390
0:25:12,83 --> 0:25:13,917
What if she saw through
his disguise?

0:25:15,125 --> 0:25:16,5

393
0:25:16,5 --> 0:25:22,542
Bushy beard and glasses?


394
0:25:22,542 --> 0:25:25,958
And suppose she saw who it was
under the disguise.


395
0:25:25,958 --> 0:25:38,125

for another body, not a witness.

of the murderer.

He cheated his partner

that you arrived at London

0:33:2,667 --> 0:33:3,792

She said they were
canceling the shooting this year

and there was no household
for me to keep.


551
0:33:8,917 --> 0:33:11,708
So, anyway, she said
she'd be grateful

if I didn't say anything
to the agency


553
0:33:14,458 --> 0:33:16,458

you know?

0:34:5,417 --> 0:34:7,375
Why has it disappeared?


574
0:34:7,375 --> 0:34:8,625
Sir, sir?


575
0:34:8,625 --> 0:34:10,0
What is it, Forgan?


576
0:34:10,0 --> 0:34:11,583
It's Mr. Havering, sir.


577
0:34:11,583 --> 0:34:15,5
He's asking to see you.


578
0:34:15,5 --> 0:34:19,542
I'll tell you what I was doing
if you promise not to tell Zoe.


579
0:34:19,542 --> 0:34:21,958
Well, let's hope
it won't be necessary.


580
0:34:21,958 --> 0:34:24,667
I'll make no promises.


581
0:34:24,667 --> 0:34:26,917
Very well, then.


582
0:34:26,917 --> 0:34:28,833
I was with Lord Quamby.


583
0:34:28,833 --> 0:34:31,625
Lord Quamby?
The racing earl?


584
0:34:31,625 --> 0:34:35,0
Yes, he's chairman of the board
in charge of on course betting.


585
0:34:35,0 --> 0:34:37,125
I wanted him to get me
off the hook.


586
0:34:37,125 --> 0:34:40,42
Well, buy me some time
on a couple of my debts.


587
0:34:40,42 --> 0:34:42,208
Why were you so reluctant
to tell us this?


588
0:34:42,208 --> 0:34:45,875
A few months ago, you see,
I promised Zoe


589
0:34:45,875 --> 0:34:48,833
that I'd never back another
horse as long as I lived.


590
0:34:48,833 --> 0:34:51,833
And will Lord Quamby
verify that you were with him?


591
0:34:51,833 --> 0:34:59,542
Of course he will.


592
0:34:59,542 --> 0:35:3,958
Tell me, Mlle. Joan,
on the night of the murder,


593
0:35:3,958 --> 0:35:7,0
when was the last time
that you saw Mme. Middleton?


594
0:35:7,0 --> 0:35:9,42
She was in the car
with Mr. Havering


595
0:35:9,42 --> 0:35:10,958
when they dropped me off
at home.


596
0:35:10,958 --> 0:35:13,792
He was on his way
to the station,


597
0:35:13,792 --> 0:35:16,75
and he gave her a lift
over to Mr. Stoddard's house.


598
0:35:16,75 --> 0:35:18,25
Mr. Stoddard the gamekeeper?


599
0:35:18,25 --> 0:35:19,708
Yes, sir.


600
0:35:19,708 --> 0:35:23,0
Ah, yes, of course,
M. Stoddard.


601
0:35:23,0 --> 0:35:26,375
You hope to be his wife one day,
do you not?


602
0:35:26,375 --> 0:35:28,75
No one's supposed to
know that, sir.


603
0:35:28,75 --> 0:35:30,833
I comprehend.


604
0:35:30,833 --> 0:35:33,542
Tell me more about
Mme. Middleton.


605
0:35:33,542 --> 0:35:35,292
JOAN:
Oh, she was that strict.


606
0:35:35,292 --> 0:35:39,667
Always leaving little notes
about the place, criticizing.


607
0:35:39,667 --> 0:35:42,917
Mr. Stoddard didn't like her.


608
0:35:42,917 --> 0:35:46,83
They used to be
quite sharp with each other.


609
0:35:46,83 --> 0:35:49,208
Did Mme. Middleton ever talk
to you about herself?


610
0:35:49,208 --> 0:35:51,292
JOAN:
No, not really.


611
0:35:51,292 --> 0:35:53,375
She said she were from Ireland.


612
0:35:53,375 --> 0:35:56,417
Mayo, I think.


613
0:35:56,417 --> 0:36:3,25
She always kept herself
to herself, like.


614
0:36:3,25 --> 0:36:6,5
Mlle. Joan, this apron?


615
0:36:6,5 --> 0:36:8,958
Oh, that's
Mrs. Middleton's, sir.


616
0:36:8,958 --> 0:36:14,208
Oh. Thank you.
That will be all.


617
0:36:14,208 --> 0:36:17,333
So, when Harrington Pace
was living in Ireland,


618
0:36:17,333 --> 0:36:19,833
he cheated his partner
and ruined him.


619
0:36:19,833 --> 0:36:23,917
Then this mysterious woman,
who was also from County Mayo,


620
0:36:23,917 --> 0:36:26,667
turns up
and replaces Mrs. Middleton.


621
0:36:26,667 --> 0:36:29,208
She was probably a relation
of the ruined man.


622
0:36:29,208 --> 0:36:31,792
She opens the door
to her accomplice,


623
0:36:31,792 --> 0:36:33,333
the fellow with the bushy beard,


624
0:36:33,333 --> 0:36:36,833
they kill Pace,
and both of them disappear.


625
0:36:36,833 --> 0:36:42,375
Absolument, mon ami.


626
0:36:42,375 --> 0:36:44,792
You have the story exact.


627
0:36:44,792 --> 0:36:49,708
Oh.


628
0:36:49,708 --> 0:36:52,542
STODDARD: In your
hunt countries, of course,


629
0:36:52,542 --> 0:36:54,458
they use your gazehound,


630
0:36:54,458 --> 0:36:56,83
hunts by sight.


631
0:36:56,83 --> 0:36:58,917
For the moistness in our air,


632
0:36:58,917 --> 0:37:2,292
we favor a dog
that hunts by scent.


633
0:37:2,292 --> 0:37:5,333
And I tell you,


634
0:37:5,333 --> 0:37:8,667
she's a prime example of that,
aren't you, huh?


635
0:37:8,667 --> 0:37:11,667
She's the best of her kind,
she is.


636
0:37:11,667 --> 0:37:13,75
That is most interesting.


637
0:37:13,75 --> 0:37:16,917
Tell me, M. Stoddard,
if you please,


638
0:37:16,917 --> 0:37:19,167
on the night
that M. Pace was killed,


639
0:37:19,167 --> 0:37:21,42
Mme. Middleton
came to your house


640
0:37:21,42 --> 0:37:23,167
to collect some game birds,
did she not?


641
0:37:23,167 --> 0:37:26,125
No.


642
0:37:26,125 --> 0:37:30,83
Oh, you're right.
I was expecting her,


643
0:37:30,83 --> 0:37:33,125
but she never arrived.


644
0:37:33,125 --> 0:37:34,542
I didn't see her
till much later,


645
0:37:34,542 --> 0:37:36,917
when she came running down lane
to tell me about the shooting.


646
0:37:36,917 --> 0:37:41,458
Chief Inspector,
there is at Hunter's Lodge


647
0:37:41,458 --> 0:37:43,0
a telephone, is there not?


648
0:37:43,0 --> 0:37:44,542
Yes, there is.


649
0:37:44,542 --> 0:37:47,42
Then why did not
Mme. Middleton herself


650
0:37:47,42 --> 0:37:49,417
telephone to the police?


651
0:37:49,417 --> 0:37:51,292
Aye, it crossed my mind then.


652
0:37:51,292 --> 0:37:54,0
What she said was


653
0:37:54,0 --> 0:37:57,958
that Mrs. Havering was near
hysterical at the horror of it.


654
0:37:57,958 --> 0:38:1,542
She wanted to get her to sleep
before the police got there,


655
0:38:1,542 --> 0:38:4,83
so she sent me to fetch them.


656
0:38:4,83 --> 0:38:9,0
Ah, yes, she needed the time
alone in the house.


657
0:38:9,0 --> 0:38:12,417
Yes, of course, of course.


658
0:38:12,417 --> 0:38:15,292
M. Stoddard,


659
0:38:15,292 --> 0:38:18,125
would you consider to involve
your excellent dog


660
0:38:18,125 --> 0:38:19,708
in a little experiment?


661
0:38:19,708 --> 0:38:22,333
She is clever with her nose,
you say?


662
0:38:22,333 --> 0:38:24,458
She's got a nose that would


663
0:38:24,458 --> 0:38:27,542
scent a poppy in
a bit of slurry, she has.


664
0:38:27,542 --> 0:38:37,75
Eh bien, M. Stoddard,
our poppy, it is in here.


665
0:38:37,75 --> 0:38:39,958
It is essential
that we determine


666
0:38:39,958 --> 0:38:41,708
the whereabouts of the person


667
0:38:41,708 --> 0:38:44,42
who calls herself
Mme. Middleton.


668
0:38:44,42 --> 0:38:47,125
Easier said than done.
Not a glimmer.


669
0:38:47,125 --> 0:38:49,875
Road, rail, local gossip,
nothing.


670
0:38:49,875 --> 0:38:52,125
-That's why I think --
-Eh-up, eh-up!


671
0:38:52,125 --> 0:38:54,208
-[ Dog whimpering ]
-What's it, girl?


672
0:38:54,208 --> 0:38:55,875
What's the matter, girl, huh?


673
0:38:55,875 --> 0:38:57,833
What's it, girl, huh?


674
0:38:57,833 --> 0:39:0,458
Hey, hey, hey, hey.


675
0:39:0,458 --> 0:39:2,917
So it's been buried?


676
0:39:2,917 --> 0:39:11,75
Some thing.


677
0:39:11,75 --> 0:39:16,167
It's a coat.


678
0:39:16,167 --> 0:39:24,458
JAPP:
And a hat.


679
0:39:24,458 --> 0:39:32,42
[ Dog whimpers ]


680
0:39:32,42 --> 0:39:33,583
Hey, look at this.


681
0:39:33,583 --> 0:39:36,5
Swipe me.


682
0:39:36,5 --> 0:39:42,333
Bon! M. Anstruther,
he will be most pleased.


683
0:39:42,333 --> 0:39:44,208
[ Whimpers ]


684
0:39:44,208 --> 0:40:27,208
What a clever dog.


685
0:40:27,208 --> 0:40:28,75
Everyone here?


686
0:40:28,75 --> 0:40:41,375
In the gun room, sir.


687
0:40:41,375 --> 0:40:46,167
M. Harrington Pace
was not a likeable man.


688
0:40:46,167 --> 0:40:52,42
He used his wealth to control
his friends and his family.


689
0:40:52,42 --> 0:40:56,0
For example, M. Stoddard,
his unacknowledged brother,


690
0:40:56,0 --> 0:40:57,917
he employed as a gamekeeper,


691
0:40:57,917 --> 0:41:1,375
but refused to lend him
the £300 necessary


692
0:41:1,375 --> 0:41:6,0
to purchase his house
and to get married.


693
0:41:6,0 --> 0:41:8,75
His nephew, M. Archie Havering,


694
0:41:8,75 --> 0:41:11,167
he used as an estate manager,


695
0:41:11,167 --> 0:41:14,458
paying him not with money,
but with promises of a legacy.


696
0:41:14,458 --> 0:41:16,583
His other nephew,
M. Roger Havering,


697
0:41:16,583 --> 0:41:19,292
was also made to dance
the attendance


698
0:41:19,292 --> 0:41:21,458
by assurances of wealth to come.


699
0:41:21,458 --> 0:41:26,83
There are, I think, here
motives for murder.


700
0:41:26,83 --> 0:41:27,75
N'est-ce pas?


701
0:41:27,75 --> 0:41:29,708
Now, look here, Poirot —


702
0:41:29,708 --> 0:41:31,292
POIROT:
No, no, no, please, M. Roger,


703
0:41:31,292 --> 0:41:34,458
I make not the accusations.
I merely speculate.


704
0:41:34,458 --> 0:41:35,958
For instance, we know that


705
0:41:35,958 --> 0:41:38,792
you could not have possibly
committed the murder,


706
0:41:38,792 --> 0:41:43,542
because at 6:15 on that night,


707
0:41:43,542 --> 0:41:56,167
you were boarding a train
for London.


708
0:41:56,167 --> 0:41:59,0
But what we did not know


709
0:41:59,0 --> 0:42:1,417
was that there was
another passenger


710
0:42:1,417 --> 0:42:8,625
who also boarded that train.


711
0:42:8,625 --> 0:42:10,25
This person


712
0:42:10,25 --> 0:42:13,167
alighted from the train
at the very next stop


713
0:42:13,167 --> 0:42:15,83
and stole the bicycle
of my friend,


714
0:42:15,83 --> 0:42:20,583
M. Anstruther --
a curious thing to do, huh?


715
0:42:20,583 --> 0:42:23,167
Hey, that's my bike!


716
0:42:23,167 --> 0:42:26,5
POIROT: But the next thing
that this person did


717
0:42:26,5 --> 0:42:31,25
was even more curious.


718
0:42:31,25 --> 0:42:34,583
He buried the bicycle.


719
0:42:34,583 --> 0:42:37,542
Then he buried all
the necessary accoutrements


720
0:42:37,542 --> 0:42:42,5
of the bearded man...


721
0:42:42,5 --> 0:42:47,958
...and turned himself
back into Mme. Middleton.


722
0:42:47,958 --> 0:42:51,83
Mrs. Middleton
was the bearded man?


723
0:42:51,83 --> 0:42:52,458
But, yes, Hastings.


724
0:42:52,458 --> 0:42:55,875
You see, we only had the word
of Mme. Middleton herself


725
0:42:55,875 --> 0:42:57,833
that a bearded man came to
the house that night,


726
0:42:57,833 --> 0:42:59,875
but, of course,
that was not true.


727
0:42:59,875 --> 0:43:1,125
No, I saw him.


728
0:43:1,125 --> 0:43:2,208
Mme. Havering, if you please,


729
0:43:2,208 --> 0:43:3,458
we will come to that
in a minute.


730
0:43:3,458 --> 0:43:5,0
HASTINGS:
It's as I've said all along,


731
0:43:5,0 --> 0:43:7,542
we've got to find
this Mrs. Middleton.


732
0:43:7,542 --> 0:43:9,125
ROGER:
Well, may I suggest


733
0:43:9,125 --> 0:43:11,5
that you get on
and do just that.


734
0:43:11,5 --> 0:43:14,625
So far, all you've done is ask
impertinent questions


735
0:43:14,625 --> 0:43:17,333
and treat respectable people
like a lot of criminals!


736
0:43:17,333 --> 0:43:20,42
Please, M. Roger,
do not be in such haste.


737
0:43:20,42 --> 0:43:22,125
We may know that you did not
commit a murder,


738
0:43:22,125 --> 0:43:24,792
but there are other things
which are not yet so clear.


739
0:43:24,792 --> 0:43:30,792
This crime was of a daring
most extraordinary.


740
0:43:30,792 --> 0:43:33,875
It had to be like clockwork.


741
0:43:33,875 --> 0:43:36,42
And the spurious Mme. Middleton


742
0:43:36,42 --> 0:43:39,667
had to have an accomplice
to wind the spring.


743
0:43:39,667 --> 0:43:41,75
JOAN:
Sorry, Mrs. Middleton.


744
0:43:41,75 --> 0:43:44,375
POIROT: At a quarter to 6:00
on the night of the murder,


745
0:43:44,375 --> 0:43:46,583
this spring,
it was ready for release.


746
0:43:46,583 --> 0:43:49,25
The guests had departed,


747
0:43:49,25 --> 0:43:52,25
Mlle. Ellie
had already gone home,


748
0:43:52,25 --> 0:43:54,792
and Mlle. Joan
had been offered a lift


749
0:43:54,792 --> 0:43:58,25
in your car, M. Havering.


750
0:43:58,25 --> 0:44:1,375
Mlle. Joan was duly dropped
at her cottage.


751
0:44:1,375 --> 0:44:3,5
Mme. Middleton
was then to be driven to


752
0:44:3,5 --> 0:44:6,292
the home of M. Stoddard
to collect some game birds,


753
0:44:6,292 --> 0:44:8,542
but, of course,
she never arrived.


754
0:44:8,542 --> 0:44:13,667
She was undergoing
a transformation.


755
0:44:13,667 --> 0:44:15,208
It was essential, you see,


756
0:44:15,208 --> 0:44:17,333
that a suspect should be seen
to alight from the train


757
0:44:17,333 --> 0:44:19,0
at the very next stop,

a suspect that could well be


759
0:44:20,625 --> 0:44:24,583
M. Roger Havering in disguise.


760
0:44:24,583 --> 0:44:27,75
Why should I try to
incriminate myself?


761
0:44:27,75 --> 0:44:30,75
Because, M. Havering,
you had planned most carefully


762
0:44:30,75 --> 0:44:33,125
your alibi --
your meeting with Lord Quamby,


763
0:44:33,125 --> 0:44:36,333
which you would seem to have
every reason for keeping secret,


764
0:44:36,333 --> 0:44:39,0
but once you were forced to
reveal it and were released,


765
0:44:39,0 --> 0:44:41,292
it was most unlikely
that the police


766
0:44:41,292 --> 0:44:43,583
would suspect you
for a second time.


767
0:44:43,583 --> 0:44:45,708
You're talking complete rubbish.


768
0:44:45,708 --> 0:44:47,958
POIROT: No, no, no,
I think not, M. Havering.


769
0:44:47,958 --> 0:44:54,458
You see, while you continued
your journey to London,


770
0:44:54,458 --> 0:44:59,708
Mme. Middleton
returned to Hunter's Lodge.


771
0:44:59,708 --> 0:45:2,333
[ Door closing ]


772
0:45:2,333 --> 0:45:5,167
Your uncle was
a very wealthy man.


773
0:45:5,167 --> 0:45:7,75
In time, you would
inherit his fortune,


774
0:45:7,75 --> 0:45:10,208
but your gambling debts
grew heavier,


775
0:45:10,208 --> 0:45:12,958
and M. Pace refused
to bail you out.


776
0:45:12,958 --> 0:45:15,958
You desperately needed
the money now,


777
0:45:15,958 --> 0:45:18,208
and so on that fateful night,


778
0:45:18,208 --> 0:45:20,583
M. Pace was shot


779
0:45:20,583 --> 0:45:25,667
in cold blood.


780
0:45:25,667 --> 0:45:27,667
Prove it!


781
0:45:27,667 --> 0:45:30,958
You just prove it.


782
0:45:30,958 --> 0:45:32,875
That is a lying slander.


783
0:45:32,875 --> 0:45:35,833
You're going to find yourself
in court, Mr. bloody Poirot!


784
0:45:35,833 --> 0:45:37,333
And who is this Mrs. Middleton


785
0:45:37,333 --> 0:45:39,292
I'm meant to have been
an accomplice of?


786
0:45:39,292 --> 0:45:40,667
You can't even find her.


787
0:45:40,667 --> 0:45:43,0
So you busy yourself
accusing everybody else!


788
0:45:43,0 --> 0:45:45,875
You think that Hercule Poirot
is unable to find


789
0:45:45,875 --> 0:45:49,333
this mysterious Mme. Middleton?


790
0:45:49,333 --> 0:45:53,792
Hercule Poirot knows a way


791
0:45:53,792 --> 0:45:55,375
to make Mme. Middleton


792
0:45:55,375 --> 0:46:0,417
appear in our midst
as if by magic.


793
0:46:0,417 --> 0:46:3,875
You do not believe in magic?


794
0:46:3,875 --> 0:46:5,583
Very well.


795
0:46:5,583 --> 0:46:10,333
I have only to tap with my cane


796
0:46:10,333 --> 0:46:12,625
on the floor three times,


797
0:46:12,625 --> 0:46:15,125
thus.

Can we not stop this charade,
Chief Inspector?


806
0:46:54,292 --> 0:47:4,125
I don't know, sir.
I've always enjoyed party games.


807
0:47:4,125 --> 0:47:5,667
Silly dog, what's it doing?

0:47:5,667 --> 0:47:11,42
[ Dog whimpers ]

[ Dog snarls, barks ]

-Stop it!
-It's all right, Zoe.


813
0:47:27,167 --> 0:47:29,75
Come on, girl.
Come on, heel!


814
0:47:29,75 --> 0:47:32,333
That's it.
Good girl. Come.


815
0:47:32,333 --> 0:47:34,542
ARCHIE: I don't know
what your silly game is,


816
0:47:34,542 --> 0:47:36,5
but it seems to have gone
horribly wrong.


817
0:47:36,5 --> 0:47:38,417
Now, leave her alone!


818
0:47:38,417 --> 0:47:41,333
Zoe had nothing whatever to do
with this Mrs. Middleton!


819
0:47:41,333 --> 0:47:43,708
On the contrary, M. Archie,


820
0:47:43,708 --> 0:47:46,83
Mme. Havering had
a very close relationship


821
0:47:46,83 --> 0:47:48,25
with the housekeeper,
Mme. Middleton.


822
0:47:48,25 --> 0:47:50,667
The odd thing about it being


823
0:47:50,667 --> 0:47:55,458
was that they were never once
seen together.


824
0:47:55,458 --> 0:48:0,375
This temporary housekeeper
had only recently been employed


825
0:48:0,375 --> 0:48:3,917
for the family's stay
at Hunter's Lodge.


826
0:48:3,917 --> 0:48:6,917
She left little notes
for the servants


827
0:48:6,917 --> 0:48:10,333
and kept herself to herself.


828
0:48:10,333 --> 0:48:14,5
If the mistress was at home,
the housekeeper was absent.


829
0:48:14,5 --> 0:48:17,333
When the housekeeper
was downstairs,


830
0:48:17,333 --> 0:48:19,458
the mistress was in her room.


831
0:48:19,458 --> 0:48:23,583
And that is where,
on the night of the murder,


832
0:48:23,583 --> 0:48:27,292
after she had been interviewed
by the police,


833
0:48:27,292 --> 0:48:30,667
Mme. Middleton
disappeared forever


834
0:48:30,667 --> 0:48:41,375
from the face of the Earth.


835
0:48:41,375 --> 0:48:46,167
Because it was you,
Mme. Zoe Havering,


836
0:48:46,167 --> 0:48:49,333
together with your husband,
you planned and carried out


837

this murder ingenious.


838
0:48:52,292 --> 0:48:54,625
Together, you plotted
to rid yourselves


839
0:48:54,625 --> 0:48:56,292
of your uncle that was hated


840
0:48:56,292 --> 0:48:59,208
and to lay your hands,
at last, on his money.


841
0:48:59,208 --> 0:49:2,958
I must ask you both to come
with me to the police station.


842
0:49:2,958 --> 0:49:7,125
How dare you?
This has gone far enough.


843

I do not intend to stand
idly by --


844
0:49:9,25 --> 0:49:34,542
Oh, shut up, Roger!


845
0:49:34,542 --> 0:49:37,125
But why did she have to
bury the bicycle?


846
0:49:37,125 --> 0:49:39,625
How could she leave it lying
around, Hastings?


847
0:49:39,625 --> 0:49:42,458
If it was found and identified
by M. Anstruther


848
0:49:42,458 --> 0:49:45,625
as the bicycle that was stolen
outside the railway station,


849
0:49:45,625 --> 0:49:47,75
then it would show
that the murderer


850
0:49:47,75 --> 0:49:51,83
was still close
to Hunter's Lodge.


851
0:49:51,83 --> 0:49:53,333
Oh, hello, Mr. Poirot.


852
0:49:53,333 --> 0:49:54,667
M. Anstruther.


853
0:49:54,667 --> 0:49:56,25
The blackberry tea
did the trick, then?

It did, indeed, monsieur.


855
0:49:57,583 --> 0:50:2,167
it also stimulated the little
gray cells to such an extent


856
0:50:2,167 --> 0:50:4,833
that it enabled me
to track down your bicycle.


857
0:50:4,833 --> 0:50:8,417
ANSTRUTHER: It's a bit of
a blooming mess, isn't it?


858
0:50:8,417 --> 0:50:10,667
-Yes, it got buried.
-Buried?


859
0:50:10,667 --> 0:50:12,667
Buried.

0:50:12,667 --> 0:50:15,333
It's all covered
in mud and mold.


861
0:50:15,333 --> 0:50:17,125
And I regret that
I did not have the time


862
0:50:17,125 --> 0:50:19,458
to clean it for you, monsieur.


863
0:50:19,458 --> 0:50:20,667
ANSTRUTHER:
I don't know as I could be seen

riding about
on a thing like that.


865
0:50:22,42 --> 0:50:23,875
That mud guard's all bent, too.

0:50:23,875 --> 0:50:27,125
M. Anstruther,


867
0:50:27,125 --> 0:50:30,542
do you or do you not
want your bicycle?


868
0:50:30,542 --> 0:50:33,667
Oh...Oh, just leave it there.


869
0:50:33,667 --> 0:50:39,917
I'll see if the boy
can do anything with it.


870
0:50:39,917 --> 0:50:42,542
Is this gratitude, Hastings?


871
0:50:42,542 --> 0:50:44,542
Is it for this
that Hercule Poirot


872
0:50:44,542 --> 0:50:46,917
exerts his talents
on behalf of the world?


873
0:50:46,917 --> 0:50:49,625
Do you expect gratitude?
Don't make me laugh.


874
0:50:49,625 --> 0:50:52,958

-do you not think, Hastings?
-Oh, yes.


878
0:51:0,833 --> 0:51:2,75
