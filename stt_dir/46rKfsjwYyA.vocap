###0 At the same time whole forests are used to satisfy another European craving:
###1 for magnificent buildings.
###10 The cathedrals in the cities are made of stone.
###14 Yet they require millions of logs for their basis and frames.
###22 Larches are needed for roof supports.
###25 Solid logs of oak, alder and elm are sunk into the ground to create foundations.
###35 Wood is indispensable for pillars and ceilings, posts and roof panels.
###41 ax handles and cart wheels.
###51 European castles, cathedrals, monasteries and churches consumed entire forests
###57 in Germany, France, Italy, Spain and England.
###68 No wonder that all the great social and economic struggles in the Middle Ages
###73 are fought in the forests around the forests and about the forests.
###77 In this competition for timber
###79 those who have money make the rules.
###82 And the money is now in the cities.
###86 Perhaps the richest city of all is Venice.
###92 It's built on wood, literally.
###95 Piles sunk into the mud to create the platform on which the great stone fa√ßades can float.
###101 But behind all this is commerce and a great maritime republic.
###110 The goods that are bought and sold are transported in wooden galleons.
###115 Venice has denuded the forests all around them to build its fleet.
###124 The city's demand is insatiable
###127 and they started to deplete the Alps.
###130 Spruce for masts, larch for planking,
###133 elm for capstans,
###135 walnut for rudders and most importantly oak for hulls.
###140 When that is not enough
###142 they cut a swath across Europe
###144 all the way to the Baltic.
###156 The Europeans have exploited their natural resources,
###159 leaving a continent where there are few fish in the rivers
###161 and less and less timber in their forests.
###167 Their towns are crowded with people
###169 and they don't know what to do with them.
###176 Rivalries between princes and kings have grown intense.
###182 Religious fervour, curiosity and greed are widespread in 1491.
###188 And there's a constant hunger for new ideas.
###193 The printing press is invented, books and ideas spread.
###203 But where do they go from here?
###211 Where can all this raw energy be channeled?
###221 This is the time when European kings and queens send explorers beyond the horizon
###227 to expand and enhance their power.
###230 Some explorers go around Africa to find the sea route to India.
###234 One has the vision to sail west to arrive in the east.
###243 He's a seaman from Genoa, Italy.
###245 A fervent amateur who has the crazy idea of sailing into the unknown to reach India.
###253 Christopher Columbus has spent five years trying to gain royal support to
###257 finance his voyage.
###263 Isabella, queen of Spain, finally agrees. What does the Spanish crown have to lose?
###270 It doesn't cost much to finance three ships.
###274 Spain has so much to gain from a shortcut to India: treasures,
###280 trade,
###281 and land.
###292 At first
###293 no one wants to board his ship.
###297 Finally he drags together a motley crew of eighty-seven men.
###302 Many are illiterates, petty criminals, even murderous who
###306 choose probable death at sea in preference to the gallows.
###311 Many are soldiers with nothing to do since Spain expelled the Moors just months before.
###319 Now they are soldiers of fortune.
###328 With his band of desperadoes Christopher Columbus sets sail from the port of Seville.
###335 It is the summer of 1492.
###341 He promises the queen that his expedition will be a success.
###346 And in a matter of weeks
###348 he will change the course of history.
###377 It is October twelve 1492 when Columbus sights land.
###388 "I saw neither sheep, nor goats nor any other beasts.
###392 All the trees were as different from ours as day from night.
###397 And so the herbage, the rocks and all things."
###404 Three Spanish ships sailed west for three months in search of India.
###409 Then finally they arrived.
###411 Eighty-seven men, among them conquistadors,
###414 pig farmers, murderers.
###419 But this is not Asia.
###422 It is an island in the Caribbean.
###425 They have no idea that they have come to a new world.
###437 The air is hot, water is warm.
###443 They have survived the voyage and have found land
###446 for the Spanish crown.
###447 And in the name of God.
###450 They are exhausted, tired, but thankful.
###467 What land is this?
###470 Where are the ports, the cities,
###472 the ships and traders they expected?
###478 The natives have seen many people arrive from the sea.
###481 Other tribes,
###482 but no one like this.
###534 They will both soon discover
###535 that this is just the beginning.
###541 Columbus and his men stay for three months in the Bahamas
###545 and have no idea that they are on the edge of two great continents.
###552 About ten times bigger than Europe.
###563 From the tropical seas
###566 to the arid deserts.
###571 It is vast
###577 and there is space,
###580 with room for every possible landscape.
###584 Stretching from the northernmost
###587 almost to the southernmost points of the globe.
###594 Spain's ** monarchy made Columbus's voyage possible.
###603 It is 1493
###604 and they've waited eagerly for seven months to learn of his discoveries.
###612 Upon his return he delivers the news and reports to Queen Isabella.
###622 In a few pages
###624 Columbus describes the paradise he has found in her name.
###630 Land to conquer,
###632 converts for Christianity
###634 riches to exploit, and gold.
###642 In Europe no news stays local for long.
###648 Traders, armies and pilgrims carry news across the continent in weeks.
###655 Columbus's letter is translated, copied and becomes a bestseller.
###660 Now many Europeans are aching for their share of the treasures.
###668 A few months later
###669 in Spain men are moving towards the ports of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.
###679 Men who have no land
###681 and no work.
###685 They cross the barren Spanish regions that offer little to live of.
###692 Desperadoes with nothing to lose.
###695 Men in need of a job.
###697 And the queen needs them.
###700 Anyone can come along, anyone can be a conquistador, even a pig farmer
###706 can win glory and riches in faraway lands.
###715 In 1493
###717 seventeen ships arrive in the new world
###719 on an island in the Caribbean Sea,
###722 carrying twelve hundred Spaniards.
###725 Columbus's second voyage begins a stampede of Spanish exploration and conquest.
###731 Some will go south, some to the Andes,
###735 some along the Mississippi.
###737 It is the conquest
###738 of the Americas.
###741 Driven by greed,
###742 carrying weapons
###743 and with one animal
###745 that does not exist on this continent.
###749 With the horse
###750 the Spanish are able to annihilate whole empires in just a few decades.
###759 Within forty years
###761 the Inca in the Andes fall to Pizarro.
###770 And the Aztecs in Central America to Cortez.
###783 Where there were towns and cities inhabited by millions of people,
###790 the Spaniards leave only ruins,
