1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,802



2
0:0:10,802 --> 0:0:13,84
EDDIE HUANG: Crazy.


3
0:0:13,84 --> 0:0:46,183
[MUSIC PLAYING]


4
0:0:46,183 --> 0:0:47,91
EDDIE HUANG: I like the sound
of this motor, man.


5
0:0:47,91 --> 0:0:49,774
LARGO: Yeah, it runs
real good.


6
0:0:49,774 --> 0:0:52,882
EDDIE HUANG: So you
live in East LA?


7
0:0:52,882 --> 0:0:55,64
EDDIE HUANG: What's
that known for?


8
0:0:55,64 --> 0:0:56,903
EDDIE HUANG: Low riders
and gangs?


9
0:0:56,903 --> 0:0:58,17
I like that.


10
0:0:58,17 --> 0:0:58,94
Real easy living.


11
0:0:58,94 --> 0:1:0,15
LARGO: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].


12
0:1:0,15 --> 0:1:1,641
EDDIE HUANG: Where
we headed now?


13
0:1:1,641 --> 0:1:14,91



14
0:1:14,91 --> 0:1:16,55
BENNY: Low riding's my life.


15
0:1:16,55 --> 0:1:20,2
I've been in it since I was 10
years old-- since 1982 I've


16
0:1:20,2 --> 0:1:20,69
been a member.


17
0:1:20,69 --> 0:1:21,24
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.


18
0:1:21,24 --> 0:1:23,21
BENNY: We have our meetings
once a month, so we try to


19
0:1:23,21 --> 0:1:26,2
come out here, grill, bring the
families, and see what's


20
0:1:26,2 --> 0:1:26,78
cracking, what's up.


21
0:1:26,78 --> 0:1:28,93
EDDIE HUANG: You know, the thing
is that growing up in


22
0:1:28,93 --> 0:1:32,22
America, you follow hip hop, you
watch movies, you always


23
0:1:32,22 --> 0:1:32,61
see low riders.


24
0:1:32,61 --> 0:1:37,79
But I never got to ride in one
going down the freeway in LA


25
0:1:37,79 --> 0:1:38,53
doing my thing.


26
0:1:38,53 --> 0:1:41,58
Now I get why people are into
low riders, because you get in


27
0:1:41,58 --> 0:1:43,42
and you feel like you're
a kid again.


28
0:1:43,42 --> 0:1:45,64
You remember riding in the back
of your parents' Lincoln,


29
0:1:45,64 --> 0:1:47,325
like that just big sofa couch.


30
0:1:47,325 --> 0:1:48,21
BENNY: Yeah, exactly.


31
0:1:48,21 --> 0:1:49,18
EDDIE HUANG: It's fresh, man.


32
0:1:49,18 --> 0:1:49,98
BENNY: First, it's
a art form, bro.


33
0:1:49,98 --> 0:1:51,555
You know, everyone has
their own style.


34
0:1:51,555 --> 0:1:52,77
And this is us.


35
0:1:52,77 --> 0:1:53,54
We grew up with it.


36
0:1:53,54 --> 0:1:54,863
This is our lifestyle, bro.


37
0:1:54,863 --> 0:2:6,202



38
0:2:6,202 --> 0:2:11,2
PETER: In the '30s, '40s,
'50s, they had what were


39
0:2:11,2 --> 0:2:13,0
called cigarette dispensers.


40
0:2:13,0 --> 0:2:15,74
You would put your cigarette
in here, and as you're


41
0:2:15,74 --> 0:2:19,64
driving, you would actually
open it and it would light


42
0:2:19,64 --> 0:2:23,205
your cigarette and you smoke
it while you're driving.


43
0:2:23,205 --> 0:2:24,89
EDDIE HUANG: These cars are
like time machines.


44
0:2:24,89 --> 0:2:26,97
You get in, these dudes
are bumping tunes from


45
0:2:26,97 --> 0:2:28,35
the '60s and '70s.


46
0:2:28,35 --> 0:2:29,8
It's beautiful to see.


47
0:2:29,8 --> 0:2:31,25
REDWOOD: What up, man?


48
0:2:31,25 --> 0:2:33,57
Big Redwood chilling
right here.


49
0:2:33,57 --> 0:2:36,565
Hot ass day, Southern
California.


50
0:2:36,565 --> 0:2:39,42
Chilling with my brother,
Techniques Car Club, you know


51
0:2:39,42 --> 0:2:40,28
what I mean?


52
0:2:40,28 --> 0:2:41,91
It's what we do on
Sundays, man.


53
0:2:41,91 --> 0:2:45,23
We bring the family out, have
a couple beers, everybody's


54
0:2:45,23 --> 0:2:47,84
cool, cook up some good
meat for the kids.


55
0:2:47,84 --> 0:2:49,78
You know what I mean?


56
0:2:49,78 --> 0:2:52,105
It's all love, man.


57
0:2:52,105 --> 0:2:54,1
We can't just have
anybody in here.


58
0:2:54,1 --> 0:2:54,96
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.


59
0:2:54,96 --> 0:2:55,28
No hooligans.


60
0:2:55,28 --> 0:2:56,195
REDWOOD: Yeah.


61
0:2:56,195 --> 0:3:0,447
And there was a long time when
there was the whole era of the


62
0:3:0,447 --> 0:3:1,145
car club wars.


63
0:3:1,145 --> 0:3:1,875
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.


64
0:3:1,875 --> 0:3:4,1
REDWOOD: Unfortunately, there's
still that stigmatism


65
0:3:4,1 --> 0:3:5,46
that's left over.


66
0:3:5,46 --> 0:3:8,97
And they associate low riding
with gang banging and all this


67
0:3:8,97 --> 0:3:9,73
other stuff.


68
0:3:9,73 --> 0:3:12,38
But we're all just working
guys, dude.


69
0:3:12,38 --> 0:3:14,635
We ain't just a bunch of
knuckleheads out here, man.


70
0:3:14,635 --> 0:3:15,885
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.


71
0:3:15,885 --> 0:3:19,29



72
0:3:19,29 --> 0:3:21,1
What did you marinate
the short ribs in?


73
0:3:21,1 --> 0:3:22,91
REDWOOD: There's a little bit
of lemon, there's some


74
0:3:22,91 --> 0:3:25,0
cilantro, there's some secret
stuff going right there.


75
0:3:25,0 --> 0:3:25,62
EDDIE HUANG: Secret stuff?


76
0:3:25,62 --> 0:3:27,49
You want to break me off with
some of the secrets?


77
0:3:27,49 --> 0:3:28,75
REDWOOD: That's the secret!


78
0:3:28,75 --> 0:3:29,86
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah?


79
0:3:29,86 --> 0:3:30,68
Oh, some Bud?


80
0:3:30,68 --> 0:3:31,37
Some Bud Light?


81
0:3:31,37 --> 0:3:31,935
UNKNOWN SPEAKER: Right.


82
0:3:31,935 --> 0:3:32,92
You know what I mean?


83
0:3:32,92 --> 0:3:34,186
EDDIE HUANG: Cilantro,
paprika.


84
0:3:34,186 --> 0:3:34,895
REDWOOD: Turmeric.


85
0:3:34,895 --> 0:3:35,85
EDDIE HUANG: You got
a little turmeric.


86
0:3:35,85 --> 0:3:36,87
REDWOOD: Garlic powder.


87
0:3:36,87 --> 0:3:37,87
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, onion salt.


88
0:3:37,87 --> 0:3:39,2
REDWOOD: Granulated onion.


89
0:3:39,2 --> 0:3:39,68
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.


90
0:3:39,68 --> 0:3:41,42
REDWOOD: You can't flavor the
meat too much, because the


91
0:3:41,42 --> 0:3:42,62
meat is the flavor, right?


92
0:3:42,62 --> 0:3:43,2
EDDIE HUANG: Yep, exactly.


93
0:3:43,2 --> 0:3:43,87
REDWOOD: You know that, right?


94
0:3:43,87 --> 0:3:45,33
You need to tell me some
of your secrets.


95
0:3:45,33 --> 0:3:49,1
EDDIE HUANG: What I do with the
short rib to tenderize it,


96
0:3:49,1 --> 0:3:50,915
beer will tenderize it,
anything carbonated.


97
0:3:50,915 --> 0:3:54,45
I like to use a Dr. Pepper
or cherry cola,


98
0:3:54,45 --> 0:3:55,48
tenderize it overnight.


99
0:3:55,48 --> 0:3:56,68
REDWOOD: Cherry cola!


100
0:3:56,68 --> 0:3:57,942
EDDIE HUANG: Definitely,
definitely.


101
0:3:57,942 --> 0:4:8,495



102
0:4:8,495 --> 0:4:9,87
[INAUDIBLE] grab me
a little space.


103
0:4:9,87 --> 0:4:11,77
[INAUDIBLE].


104
0:4:11,77 --> 0:4:13,94
No, you know I'm Chinese, man.


105
0:4:13,94 --> 0:4:14,9
I just eat rice.


106
0:4:14,9 --> 0:4:16,82
[LAUGHTER]


107
0:4:16,82 --> 0:4:18,79
EDDIE HUANG: The short rib?


108
0:4:18,79 --> 0:4:19,894
It was just hanging out there.


109
0:4:19,894 --> 0:4:21,18
Here.


110
0:4:21,18 --> 0:4:22,512
We'll share some of it.


111
0:4:22,512 --> 0:4:23,4
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].


112
0:4:23,4 --> 0:4:23,54
Give him a piece, please.


113
0:4:23,54 --> 0:4:24,24
EDDIE HUANG: I got tons of it.


114
0:4:24,24 --> 0:4:25,49
I got tons of it.


115
0:4:25,49 --> 0:4:27,26



116
0:4:27,26 --> 0:4:30,2
[LAUGHTER]


117
0:4:30,2 --> 0:4:31,125
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey!


118
0:4:31,125 --> 0:4:32,15
EDDIE HUANG: No, I love it.


119
0:4:32,15 --> 0:4:34,815
I like this!


120
0:4:34,815 --> 0:4:36,6
Yo, so I want to ask you this.


121
0:4:36,6 --> 0:4:38,55
It's definitely not to be
sensational or whatever.


122
0:4:38,55 --> 0:4:42,5
But he was telling me about
the car club wars.


123
0:4:42,5 --> 0:4:43,24
How did that happen?


124
0:4:43,24 --> 0:4:45,36
PETER: It was a sad time
in low riding.


125
0:4:45,36 --> 0:4:49,4
If you disrespected another
club, they're gonna get you.


126
0:4:49,4 --> 0:4:51,44
They're going to catch you on
the boulevard, pull you out of


127
0:4:51,44 --> 0:4:53,56
your car, and beat you
down right there, and


128
0:4:53,56 --> 0:4:55,9
jack up your car.


129
0:4:55,9 --> 0:4:58,26
Bumper jacks, crow bars,
whatever they had.


130
0:4:58,26 --> 0:5:2,38
Back then, the guy riding
shotgun had a shotgun.


131
0:5:2,38 --> 0:5:3,7
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah


132
0:5:3,7 --> 0:5:6,81
PETER: I said, the person
sitting in the passenger seat


133
0:5:6,81 --> 0:5:9,15
now is my kid.


134
0:5:9,15 --> 0:5:11,79
I said, and that's a little
girl or a little boy.


135
0:5:11,79 --> 0:5:14,68
And I don't need nobody shooting
at me or doing


136
0:5:14,68 --> 0:5:17,7
something to me because
of old beefs.


137
0:5:17,7 --> 0:5:19,83
Since then, everybody's got
respect for everybody.


138
0:5:19,83 --> 0:5:20,12
You see low rider--


139
0:5:20,12 --> 0:5:21,38
EDDIE HUANG: Well, people
learned the respect from the


140
0:5:21,38 --> 0:5:22,32
war, most likely.


141
0:5:22,32 --> 0:5:23,11
PETER: You had to.


142
0:5:23,11 --> 0:5:23,86
EDDIE HUANG: 'Cause you
want to avoid that.


143
0:5:23,86 --> 0:5:25,33
PETER: We fought for
that respect.


144
0:5:25,33 --> 0:5:26,44
We fought for that.


145
0:5:26,44 --> 0:5:27,69
But one day you gotta grow up.


146
0:5:27,69 --> 0:5:40,49



147
0:5:40,49 --> 0:5:42,825
A lot of people don't
talk about it.


148
0:5:42,825 --> 0:5:44,36
It's a black eye
in low riding.


149
0:5:44,36 --> 0:5:44,76
You know what I mean?


150
0:5:44,76 --> 0:5:48,5
We had to go through that
to get where we're at.


151
0:5:48,5 --> 0:5:49,43
But we've done it now.


152
0:5:49,43 --> 0:5:50,36
It's in the past.


153
0:5:50,36 --> 0:5:53,56
And our kids will be able to
do this the rest of their


154
0:5:53,56 --> 0:5:55,158
lives with no problems.


155
0:5:55,158 --> 0:5:56,408
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.


156
0:5:56,408 --> 0:6:10,44



157
0:6:10,44 --> 0:6:12,43
Things ain't always
what they seem.


158
0:6:12,43 --> 0:6:14,38
You see low riders affiliated
with gangs.


159
0:6:14,38 --> 0:6:17,12
And that shit definitely
happened, but that shit


160
0:6:17,12 --> 0:6:18,86
doesn't tell the whole story.


161
0:6:18,86 --> 0:6:22,71
This is something that people
really live since birth.


162
0:6:22,71 --> 0:6:23,74
They're not trying either.


163
0:6:23,74 --> 0:6:27,41
They're not like people going
to vintage stores trying to


164
0:6:27,41 --> 0:6:29,84
adopt another era.


165
0:6:29,84 --> 0:6:32,19
This lifestyle has pervaded
them, and


166
0:6:32,19 --> 0:6:33,82
they've hung onto it.


167
0:6:33,82 --> 0:6:38,0
And for me to come here and be
taken in for a day, it's life


168
0:6:38,0 --> 0:6:39,3
changing shit.


169
0:6:39,3 --> 0:6:43,72
From East LA to Persian LA, to
here, this is just people


170
0:6:43,72 --> 0:6:45,2
living, man.


171
0:6:45,2 --> 0:6:46,11
Keep your eyes peeled.


172
0:6:46,11 --> 0:6:47,515
Watch for the real, all right?


173
0:6:47,515 --> 0:6:49,352
Fresh Off the Boat
with Eddie Huang.


174
0:6:49,352 --> 0:6:49,818
We out.


175
0:6:49,818 --> 0:6:53,11
ALL: Fresh Off the Boat!


176
0:6:53,11 --> 0:8:53,11
