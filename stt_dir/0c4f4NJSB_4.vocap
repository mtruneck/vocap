###8 SHANE SMITH: We came back from Bulgaria blown away by our
###12 biggest story that we'd ever done, feeling like we were 60
###16 Minutes or something.
###17 And we gave all the footage to our editor Jake.
###19 And Jake was confused and saddened and
###23 freaked out by it.
###24 So what we're going to do is go through the whole editing
###26 process with Jake.
###28 JAKE BURGHART: Did you go to Varna or Bapha first?
###30 SHANE SMITH: I don't know what Bapha is.
###32 I think Bapha is Varna.
###34 That's sort of like that's phonetic and that's English.
###37 So we should start there.
###38 We did an article in the magazine about a French
###42 journalist who went to Bulgaria and bought a warhead
###45 on the black market.
###46 We were so fascinated by this that we decided to fly to
###50 Sofia and research it ourselves.
###52 And when we were there, we met this guy who'd written the
###54 first article about it from Standart.
###56 He's an American dude, but he's been living
###59 there for 10 years.
###60 MATTHEW BRUNWASSER: Every big arms scandal that happened in
###63 the world had a Bulgarian connection.
###64 SHANE SMITH: Sure.
###65 MATTHEW BRUNWASSER: They'd find some box which said,
###67 these bullets were made in Bulgaria.
###68 SHANE SMITH: He's the guy who helped us find this Ivanov.
###71 It's not his right name, Ivanov is like Smith.
###75 It's like, you don't want anyone to
###76 know, like me, Smith--
###77 Ivanov.
###78 MATTHEW BRUNWASSER: I first heard about Mr. Ivanov in
###82 2001, a couple months after September 11.
###86 He is a former military intelligence colonel.
###91 He went into private business finding construction workers
###95 for the building industry in Saudi Arabia.
###98 The bin Laden family's one the most powerful in Saudi Arabia.
###101 And if you're going to do construction work in Saudi
###103 Arabia, you're going to work with them
###105 one way or the other.
###108 SHANE SMITH: We're interviewing this dude who
###112 sold a warhead on the black market.
###115 
###129 We're here in Sliven, which is in eastern Bulgaria.
###134 It used to be a Russian military base where they have
###137 some arms dumps.
###139 Sliven is important because it's the place where the
###143 French journalist bought the warhead.
###144 It's where everything went down.
###146 So we went there and are researching and checking
###148 things out, and we get word that Ivanov is actually in
###151 Sunny Beach.
###153 
###160 We just got to Sunny Beach.
###162 We've been driving for six hours, we're on the Black Sea.
###164 Apparently, Ivanov is here doing a construction project
###167 for retirees.
###169 To him, there's no difference between making Beverly Hills
###172 condos on the Black Sea and selling warheads.
###175 Because it's all just capitalism.
###177 It's just buying and selling.
###178 JAKE BURGHART: He's just out in the open doing normal
###180 business now.
###181 SHANE SMITH: Definitely.
###181 JAKE BURGHART: Why would he even talk to you?
###184 I mean, he's got his own stuff going now.
###186 SHANE SMITH: Well, because we gave him money.
###189 Again, everything's very simple there.
###191 It's capitalism, it's just like you want
###193 anything, pay for it.
###194 The mentality is selling women, selling drugs, selling
###198 guns, selling condos, selling cars, selling houses--
###201 it doesn't matter.
###202 And the attitude, too, is this is your system, it's your
###206 capitalism.
###207 How can you look down your noses at
###208 us for selling warheads?
###209 That's what you do.
###210 Warheads are worth money, and therefore we sell them.
###212 EDDY MORETTI: So what's better,
###213 capitalism or communism?
###214 
###233 SHANE SMITH: And would you say this is the largest investment
###235 of foreign capital in Bulgaria right now?
###237 
###242 SHANE SMITH: What's the property tax
###244 situation in Bulgaria?
###245 Once you buy, you have to pay tax?
###246 
###254 SHANE SMITH: As we're talking to him about his construction
###257 project, which actually has a lot of Kuwaiti and Saudi
###261 Arabian investment, the topic of the Bin Laden Construction
###265 Company came up.
###266 And he said look, if we're going to talk about this any
###268 more, we have to go back to your hotel where we can film
###271 in private.
###272 And I want my face blurred and my voice distorted.
###274 And we said, OK, let's go.
###276 
###296 SHANE SMITH: Not the daddy bin Laden, Osama bin Laden.
###301 SHANE SMITH: And what did he want?
###303 
###317 SHANE SMITH: So what they asked him for was to set up a
###320 waste management company that would get the contract to deal
###323 with the radioactive waste from Kozloduy, which is the
###327 big Bulgarian nuclear power station.
###330 They asked him to get this waste management
###332 company, he's like why?
###333 And they're like, well, we want to get waste.
###336 That's me being an Arab.
###338 And then he said, but why?
###340 Why don't you get the real thing?
###341 And they're like, real thing?
###344 And that's how the French guy found out that real thing,
###347 meaning the warhead.
###348 
###370 SHANE SMITH: So they brought in Fedor Patchenko, who was
###373 the ex-Vice Director of the Soviet atomic program, to
###376 verify that it was real.
###378 
###381 SHANE SMITH: When you actually see the footage of the
###384 detonator, you're like, they don't need to get shitty
###387 radioactive waste.
###387 They can buy a plutonium detonator on the black market.
###392 So that's when you're like holy shit,
###395 holy shit, holy shit.
###396 JAKE BURGHART: So is it called a dirty bomb because it's made
###399 with waste?
###400 SHANE SMITH: Yes.
###402 So let's say you set off a dirty bomb made out of cesium
###405 or something, some radioactive material, in New York.
###408 It wouldn't kill that many people.
###409 Maybe it would kill a couple thousand people.
###411 But it would irradiate all of Manhattan, so everyone would
###414 have to leave New York.
###415 Because the chances of getting cancer would increase 100%
###419 day-by-day.
###420 Obviously nobody wants to get cancer, so they leave.
###422 You can't come back for another 30 or 40 years, and
###425 you can't clean it up.
###425 So New York ceases to exist, it's done, which would kill
###430 America, right?
###431 JAKE BURGHART: So where's the bomb?
###434 
###445 SHANE SMITH: Well we said, where's the bomb?
###447 And he said oh, I buried it in my mother's garden in Varna.
###451 And we're like, well, hey, we'll give you money.
###452 Let's go see the bomb.
###454 He was like no, no, we can't.
###455 We tried to find out, but the bomb's still out there, which
###458 is kind of terrifying.
###459 Or there's other bombs.
###461 I mean, this was part of the old Soviet
###462 arms dump from Sliven.
###464 There might be 10 other bombs.
###465 God knows who the hell bought them.
###469 JAKE BURGHART: Wow.
###470 SHANE SMITH: Yeah.
###472 So if you can go buy one of these things on the black
###475 market, that's it.
###476 JAKE BURGHART: Which you guys just went and found.
###477 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, we found the dude who sold it.
###479 Then that's it, that's the end of time.
###482 Because it could be Osama bin Laden, it could be some white
###485 supremacist dude from Arkansas, it could be some guy
###488 who hates your football team, whatever it is.
###491 I know, why don't we know this?
###493 Why aren't we being told this?
###495
