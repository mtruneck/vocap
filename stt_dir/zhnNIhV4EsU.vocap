###21 SUROOSH ALVI: So we're here in Baghdad.
###23 Right down there, that's Firdos Square.
###25 That's where the famous scene took place where Saddam
###29 Hussein's statue was pulled down.
###31 We came here in 2006 when we filmed "Heavy Metal in
###35 Baghdad." It was a very, very different city then.
###37 It was the height of the insurgency.
###39 It was a war zone, full occupation.
###43 And that occupation is now over.
###45 A year ago, America pulled out their troops.
###47 BARACK OBAMA: Tonight, I am announcing that the American
###50 combat mission in Iraq has ended.
###53 Operation Iraqi Freedom is over.
###56 Last February, I announced a plan that would bring our
###59 combat brigades out of Iraq while redoubling our efforts
###62 to strengthen Iraq's security forces and support its
###65 government and people.
###67 That's what we've done.
###69 SUROOSH ALVI: We found it strange that Baghdad is not in
###71 the news at all these days.
###73 What happened?
###73 It was the biggest news story in the world
###76 for almost a decade.
###77 And then overnight, it's over.
###79 So we wanted to come here and see what the effects of this
###83 occupation were.
###84 
###91 When the Americans left, Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki
###94 intensified his efforts to consolidate power among the
###97 Shia majority.
###98 The Sunni minority, a group that enjoyed great privilege
###101 under Saddam Hussein have been marginalized.
###104 Naturally, the Sunnis are not taking this lying down.

###121 SUROOSH ALVI: Massive protests in Sunni areas and a surge of
###124 sectarian killings throughout the country become the new
###127 normal in postwar Iraq.
###129 In 2012 alone, there were more than 1,600 deaths.
###136 Through making "Heavy Metal in Baghdad," we met Waleed, the
###139 original singer of Acrassicauda.
###142 At the time, they were the only metal band in Iraq.
###144 [METAL MUSIC PLAYING]
###150 SUROOSH ALVI: But shortly after that meeting, Waleed was
###153 forced to flee the country and seek refugee status in the
###155 West after receiving numerous death threats.
###159 With the war officially over, Waleed decided it was time to
###162 return to Iraq.
###163 It would be his first visit home since he left in 2004.
###167 We sent a cameraman to accompany him on his trip and
###169 made plans to meet up with him once we arrived.

###240 SUROOSH ALVI: We arrived in Baghdad a few hours after
###241 Waleed and were headed to the guest house
###244 where we'd be staying.
###244 But that's when we ran into the Karrada Bats.
###247 They're a group of young punks who are
###249 basically totally insane.
###250 [PUNK MUSIC PLAYING]
###265 SUROOSH ALVI: We're with a Baghdadi biker gang, we were
###268 wondering, what to kids in Baghdad do for fun?
###270 Well, this is it.
###273 A variety of different styles--
###275 this hybrid soccer player meets Mad Max look, which is
###280 my personal favorite.
###282 Then there's this guy who's got the full on Fox racing
###284 gear, leather from head to toe.
###288 This guy's riding with his flip flops-- doesn't seem
###290 totally wise.
###291 
###294 I worry about that guy.
###295 I'm not sure he's going to survive the day.
###297 
###300 So you guys are the Karrada Bats.
###302 Are there other gangs in other cities, like Sadr City?
###304 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###306 
###309 SUROOSH ALVI: So do you ever get in trouble with the cops?

###355 SUROOSH ALVI: You guys have more freedom now or before?
###357 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###359 
###365 SUROOSH ALVI: These contradictory sentiments, of
###366 wanting freedom but at the same time missing of rule of
###370 Saddam Hussein was something we would hear again and again.
###374 And while these guys longed for American style liberties--
###377 at least surface level liberties, like looking and
###380 dressing like maniacs--
###381 it was clear that at least some of them would trade it
###384 all in for the stability that they enjoyed during Saddam
###387 Hussein's notoriously cruel regime.
###389 
###397 [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
###402 Since it was the Muslim holy month of Muharram, which is
###405 especially significant for the Shia, we decided to
###408 head to Sadr City.
###409 It's Friday.
###410 We're going to check out the big prayer.
###413 The prayer leaves a sight to be seen.
###415 Everybody prays on the streets for a huge distance-- the
###418 mosque all the way up.
###420 Now, just a few years back, the idea of westerners paying
###423 a little visit to Sadr City would have been unthinkable,
###426 as it was the heart of the insurgency against the
###429 American occupation, the home of firebrand cleric Muqtada
###432 Al-Sadr and his Mahdi Army.
###435 Even now, it took a lot of work and a Mahdi Army escort
###438 to get us in.
###440 It's supposedly forbidden to fight during the month of
###443 Muharram, but with heightened Sunni-Shia tensions, the Iraqi
###446 army thought it was a good idea to have the bomb squad
###449 present just in case.
###450 
###453 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###456 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###458 
###466 SUROOSH ALVI: More than 13,000 people turned out to pray and
###469 to listen to a cleric who influences the attitudes of an
###472 even greater number of Iraq's Shia majority.
###475 MITHAL AL-HASNAWI: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###476 
###508 SUROOSH ALVI: How do you feel about the westernization of
###510 the Iraqi youth since the American occupation and since
###514 they've left.
###515 MITHAL AL-HASNAWI: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###516 
###535 SUROOSH ALVI: The cleric made it clear that getting the US
###537 out of Iraq wasn't enough.
###539 He wants to eliminate American influence of any kind.
###543 We headed back to the neighborhood of Karrada to
###545 meet up with Waleed and get a tour of his old haunts.
###548 Hey, welcome to Iraq, buddy.
###549 Welcome home.
###550 WALEED NESYIF: Thank you.
###552 SUROOSH ALVI: Waleed wanted to check out Acrassicauda's old
###554 practice space--
###555 that is, if we could find it.
###558 There's a strange feeling walking around, considering
###560 the last time I was here, I wasn't even allowed to get out
###563 of our armored car.
###565 WALEED NESYIF: It's been a very, very long since I last
###567 walked this street.
###569 But this is filled with memories of starving nights
###573 with the band hitting the shit out of the instruments,
###577 rocking out and trying to figure out how the fuck are we
###579 going to go back home?
###580 SUROOSH ALVI: So this is basically 10 years ago.
###583 WALEED NESYIF: Yeah.
###585 This is it.
###586 SUROOSH ALVI: It's been rebuilt.
###587 WALEED NESYIF: Yeah.
###588 
###590 It's completely changed now.
###592 SUROOSH ALVI: It's like art galleries.
###594 WALEED NESYIF: Yeah.
###595 SUROOSH ALVI: If we hadn't been sure this was the spot,
###598 we would have walked right by it.
###600 The practice based got completely bombed out during
###603 the war, and today, it's unrecognizable, which I guess
###606 is a good thing.
###608 WALEED NESYIF: The area changed so much that it looks
###611 completely different.
###614 SUROOSH ALVI: Waleed wanted to see if his childhood home was
###616 still standing.
###617 But on our way there, we were reintroduced to one of the
###620 most notorious features of Baghdad--
###622 checkpoints.
###625 Car bombs are such an issue in Baghdad that hundreds of the
###628 points that were originally established by the American
###631 military are still in place today.
###634 WALEED NESYIF: Look at this fucking shit, man.
###635 Have you noticed every street has a check point?
###638 Every area has a checkpoint of entrance and exit.
###640 It's so sad.
###642 Literally, you have to plan your day to the T.
###645 SUROOSH ALVI: Because it slows everything down.
###646 WALEED NESYIF: Yeah.
###648 SUROOSH ALVI: Not only does it make getting around a
###649 nightmare, but doing anything other than staring straight
###652 ahead and hoping you get through can throw your entire
###655 day into a tailspin.
###656 Put it down.
###658 What are they saying?
###660 You can't film?
###661 WALEED NESYIF: Exaclty.
###661 They're like, don't film near a police patrol.
###664 SUROOSH ALVI: After inspecting our press credentials and
###666 undergoing a thorough search, we were allowed to slowly make
###669 our way to Waleed's old house.
###672 WALEED NESYIF: Everything is blockaded.
###674 You can't really access the house or the neighborhood.
###677 So we had to around, go all the way back, and then come
###679 through here.
###681 SUROOSH ALVI: Did it get bombed, this neighborhood?
###683 WALEED NESYIF: Yeah.
###683 And it looks pretty fucking different.
###684 
###697 That is pretty fucking insane.
###699 This used to be my old library.
###701 
###704 Fuck.
###705 [ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING]
###707 WALEED NESYIF: Looks like a fucking junkyard, man.
###712 SUROOSH ALVI: Right before Waleed left the country, he
###714 received a series of death threats.
###716 His work as a fixer for foreign journalists and as a
###719 member of a heavy metal band made him a target.
###722 WALEED NESYIF: I'll show you right here.
###723 So at 6:00 in the morning, I would leave.
###726 And there was a note right here, an envelope--
###729 right here.
###731 And when I opened it, it was a very, very frank letter of we
###736 shall cleanse the soil of our country from the stench of
###740 people like you.
###742 So I went kind of crazy and I went into the street and I
###744 started screaming and yelling-- like, if you're a
###746 man, just going come up right now.
###748 I came back after two weeks.
###750 And I left at a different time, this
###751 time, in the morning.
###753 And there was another one of those.
###756 SUROOSH ALVI: Waiting for you when you walked in.
###757 WALEED NESYIF: Waiting for me.
###757 So what I realized is that the person who had dropped it had
###761 to have been watching over from somewhere around here
###766 where he can see me leaving the apartment and going down.
###770 And that's when I knew that the danger was very, very
###772 imminent on my family because of me.
###775 SUROOSH ALVI: Right.
###776 WALEED NESYIF: So yeah, three days after
###777 that, I was in Jordan.
###779 SUROOSH ALVI: But the death threats against anyone who's
###781 not on the straight and narrow continue to this day.
###784 And as we would learn, these threats are not empty.
###787 
###795 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###803 SUROOSH ALVI: From what we were seeing and hearing, the
###805 secular society that was the hallmark of Saddam Hussein's
###808 Iraq has largely been replaced with religious conservatism.
###812 Mix that with western-inspired youth culture, and there are
###815 going to be problems.
###817 Subcultures in Iraq are under attack.
###819 For example, the Iraqi equivalent of emo kids are
###823 being targeted.
###824 And in one of the biggest stories out of Iraq since the
###826 US has left, a number of them were supposedly killed.
###830 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###832 
###844 SUROOSH ALVI: However, there wasn't a lot of concrete
###846 evidence supporting the stories.
###848 And some people thought that the case of these emo killings
###852 was just scare mongering to keep kids from
###854 straying from tradition.
###856 We went to meet with Dog Faced Corpse and Fatology, two local
###860 metal bands, to get their opinion on it.
###862 -I think it's tea time.
###863 SUROOSH ALVI: Oh, yeah.
###864 Great.
###865 Thanks, buddy.
###866 Cheers.
###867 [ARABIC].
###869 So this emo story, is it legit or is it bullshit?
###875 Did it actually happen?
###877 -It did not.
###878 -No, it's true, man.
###879 -It's true?
###880 No, no.
###880 SUROOSH ALVI: See?
###880 There's no--
###882 well, you're saying it happened and you're saying it
###884 didn't.
###884 -Yeah, it happened.
###885 -The media exaggerates the things.
###888 -I think it's bullshit.
###890 -I think it's some bullshit.
###891 As you know, they think that emos are
###896 metalheads are satanists.
###899 It's everything.
###900 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###902 
###917 SUROOSH ALVI: So they had to turn the freezer off to plug
###921 in the amp.
###922 Across the street, there's a religious cleric.
###924 It's the month of the Muharram, and he gets pretty
###927 pissed off, apparently.
###928 
###931 So yeah--
###932 they're a bit freaked out about playing right now.
###934 [METAL MUSIC]
###954 SUROOSH ALVI: Dog Faced Corpse-- where does
###955 the name come from?
###956 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###958 
###987 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###989 
###998 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###999 
###1020 -Sounds good?
###1021 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah, man.
###1022 Thanks for doing that.
###1023 I know that the religious cleric is probably not too
###1025 happy right now.
###1026 It's Muharram and everything.
###1028 Or yeah, maybe he's out there.
###1031 It was pretty clear that no matter what kind of music
###1034 you're playing--
###1035 rap, emo, metal, or even classical--
###1038 you could get killed.
###1040 But in terms of oppression, the group that has it the
###1042 absolute worst is the gay community in Iraq.
###1046 What is a situation like here for you?
###1049 ALI AL-HAFEZ: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1050 
###1080 SUROOSH ALVI: During Saddam Hussein's time, you were
###1082 persecuted for being gay.
###1083 And now, you live in fear of being persecuted as well.
###1088 So it was bad before and it's still bad.
###1090 ALI AL-HAFEZ: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1092 
###1107 ALI AL-HAFEZ: These are my friends.
###1110 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1111 
###1128 SUROOSH ALVI: That's you?
###1130 ALI AL-HAFEZ: Yeah.
###1130 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah, that's a good look for you.
###1132 [LAUGHING]
###1134 ALI AL-HAFEZ: Jasmine, Sorry.
###1136 Why?
###1136 Excuse me, cat.
###1139 SUROOSH ALVI: I assume it's a very underground kind of world
###1143 that you have.
###1143 ALI AL-HAFEZ: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1145 
###1187 SUROOSH ALVI: Even though they might be part of the same
###1189 group that's persecuting you guys?
###1191 ALI AL-HAFEZ: [ARABIC]
###1193 SUROOSH ALVI: Wow.
###1193 That's crazy.
###1196 And are you getting help from the gay rights organizations
###1200 in the West?
###1201 Are you get-- no.
###1201 Not yet.
###1202 ALI AL-HAFEZ: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1203 
###1224 SUROOSH ALVI: The US may have withdrawn from Iraq, but the
###1226 country is far from rebuilt.
###1229 The people who know this best are the reporters at Al Nahar,
###1233 a newspaper that's been a thorn in the side of the
###1235 Maliki administration.
###1237 What do you think America accomplished by coming here
###1240 and occupying your country for eight, nine years?
###1245 HASSAN GUMAA: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1246 
###1280 SUROOSH ALVI: To add insult to injury, a lot of the money
###1282 that was meant to help Iraq get back on its feets has
###1285 either been stolen or squandered, sometimes with
###1288 deadly results--
###1289 case in point, a bomb detecting device
###1292 known as the ADE 651.
###1295 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1315 SUROOSH ALVI: While passing through the various
###1316 checkpoints, we kept seeing the military using these
###1319 little magic wands that are supposed to detect explosives.
###1323 The thing is, they don't.
###1325 The New York Times revealed that these devices
###1327 were a scam in 2009.
###1330 And yet, more than three years later, the military was still
###1334 relying on them to detect bombs being
###1336 brought into Baghdad.
###1337 No wonder so many people were getting killed.
###1340 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1341 
###1355 SUROOSH ALVI: Now, with these units being sold to the Iraqis
###1357 at up to $60,000 each, you'd expect a
###1361 little production value.
###1362 But instead, they're a cheap piece of plastic with an AM/FM
###1366 radio antenna on it and no power supply.
###1369 The cards they speak of, the ones that supposedly calibrate
###1372 the device to detect different types of explosives, are
###1375 little more than business cards with words like C4
###1378 written on them.
###1379 HASSAN SALMA KHALIFA: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1380 
###1399 SUROOSH ALVI: The wands are the invention of Jim
###1401 McCormick, a British businessman who sold them to
###1404 the Iraqi government for a total of $85 million,
###1407 promising that they would save lives.
###1409 But what they did was the exact opposite.
###1411 They allowed bombs to slip past checkpoints, while making
###1414 McCormick rich.
###1415 But the most insane part of the story is that, in spite of
###1419 the obvious uselessness of the device, and in spite of the
###1422 arrest and trial of Jim McCormick, the Iraqi military
###1426 and police are still using them at every
###1428 checkpoint in the city.
###1430 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1431 
###1453 HASSAN SALMA KHALIFA: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1454 
###1479 SUROOSH ALVI: With our time in Baghdad drawing to a close, we
###1481 headed back to Waleed's place.
###1482 We wanted to see how he was dealing about the
###1484 home he left behind.
###1487 WALEED NESYIF: The electricity's coming back.
###1489 SUROOSH ALVI: Generator's kicking in.
###1490 WALEED NESYIF: Yeah.
###1490 So my family has, basically, three lines right now-- two
###1493 generators and one governmental line.
###1496 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah.
###1496 WALEED NESYIF: So whenever one goes off, the
###1498 other one kicks in--
###1499 SUROOSH ALVI: That's good.
###1500 WALEED NESYIF: --and so on and so forth.
###1500 SUROOSH ALVI: So they have electricity around the clock.
###1502 So what was it like for you to come home after eight years?
###1507 WALEED NESYIF: The difference which between eight years ago
###1509 and now, it's titanic.
###1510 The city is in this complete state of sterile living.
###1516 Everybody's trying to keep it together,
###1519 but nothing is together.
###1521 I don't think Iraq found its comfortable middle ground yet,
###1526 because the city still exists within two extremes.
###1529 You have the religious massive extreme, and then you have the
###1533 other wanting to be westernized without really
###1537 understanding what westernism is.
###1541 SUROOSH ALVI: So what is your family telling you now that
###1542 you're here?
###1543 What's it like for them?
###1545 WALEED NESYIF: They're praying for the days
###1547 of Saddam to return.
###1549 In 1991, America came and destroyed literally 75% of
###1554 Iraqi infrastructure and all of the cities.
###1557 It was all destroyed, completely.
###1558 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah.
###1560 WALEED NESYIF: Saddam restored everything within six months.
###1562 People started saying, it was like, well, if Saddam was able
###1564 to do it during the section--
###1566 and he nothing, really.
###1567 The country had just come out of a major war.
###1569 Why is America incapable of doing the same?
###1573 The worst thing America has done to Iraq
###1576 and Iraqis is this.
###1578 They made a dictator look like an angel in comparison to what
###1585 we have right now.
###1588 SUROOSH ALVI: And that's what America accomplished.
###1590 They made Saddam look good.
###1592 
###1595 Nostalgia is a powerful thing.
###1596 It can make the past seem better in the present, even
###1600 when that past was ruled over by a tyrant who murdered those
###1604 who opposed him and treated the majority of Iraq's
###1606 population, the Shia, like second class citizens.
###1611 For all of America's efforts, for the billions of dollars
###1614 spent and more than a million lives lost, today Iraq is
###1619 looking to the past instead of the future.
###1621
