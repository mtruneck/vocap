###11 Bigger welcome! Hello, San Francisco!
###15 TEDx – oh my God, blinding light!
###18 Hi, everybody! How are you?
###20 (Audience cheering) Fine?! Oh my gosh! Okay, so...
###23 My name is Mel Robbins, and for the last seventeen years,
###27 I have done nothing but help people get everything that they want.
###35 Within reason! My husband's here.
###38 So, I've done it in the courtroom, in the boardroom, in the bedroom,
###44 in people's living room, whatever room you want to be in,
###47 if I'm there, I will help you get whatever you want by any means necessary.
###52 For the last three years – I host a syndicated radio show.
###56 Five days a week, I go live in forty cities
###59 and I talk to men and women across America who feel stuck.
###63 Do you know that a third of Americans feel dissatisfied with their lives right now?
###71 That is a hundred million people!
###75 That's insane!
###78 And I've come face to face with it in this new show that I'm doing,
###81 which is also insane, it's called "In-laws".
###84 I move in with families across America – (Laughter)
###89 You guessed it!
###91 – who are at war with their in-laws.
###95 We move them into the same house, I verbally assassinate everybody,
###100 we open up Pandora's box,
###102 and I get people to stop arguing about the donuts
###106 and who is hosting Thanksgiving dinner,
###107 and talk about the real stuff.
###111 And that's what I want to talk to you about.
###114 I'm here for you.
###116 I'm going to tell you everything I know in less than eighteen minutes
###120 about how to get what you want.
###122 So I want you to take a millisecond right now
###125 and think about what you want.
###126 You!
###128 And I want you to be selfish.
###130 Screw Simon and the "We" thing. This is about me, right now!
###133 (Laughter) (Applause) Sorry, Simon.
###137 What do you want? And here's the deal.
###141 I don't want it to sound good to other people.
###144 Being healthy will not get your ass on a treadmill.
###148 Losing your manboobs, so you can hook up with somebody,
###152 now that's motivation. (Laughter)
###155 So, I want to know: What do you want?
###159 Do you want to lose weight? Do you want to triple your income?
###163 Do you want to start a nonprofit? Do you want to find love?
###167 What is it? Get it, right here.
###169 You know what it is, don't analyze it to death, just pick something.
###172 That's part of the problem. You won't pick.
###177 So, we're going to be talking about how you get what you want.
###183 And frankly, getting what you want is simple.
###188 But notice I didn't say it was easy.
###192 It's very simple.
###194 In fact, if you think about it,
###198 we live in the most amazing moment in time.
###201 So that thing that you have up here, whatever it may be,
###205 you want to use healthy eating to cure your diabetes,
###208 you want to figure out how to take care of the elders
###212 and start a new hospice center,
###214 you want to move to Africa and build a school... Guess what?
###218 You can walk into a book store – right now! –
###221 and buy at least ten books written by credentialed experts
###224 on how the hell you do it.
###226 You could Google it.
###228 And you could probably find at least, I don't know - a thousand blogs
###234 documenting the step, by step, by step transformation
###237 that somebody else is already doing.
###239 You can find anybody online and cyber-stalk them!
###244 (Laughter)
###246 You can just walk in their footsteps – just use the science of drafting.
###250 Follow what everyone else has done, because somebody is already doing it!
###254 So why don't you have what you want,
###256 when you have all the information that you need,
###259 you have the contacts that you need,
###262 there are probably free tools online that allow you to start a business,
###266 or join a group, or do whatever the heck you want!?
###270 It all comes down to one word:
###273 F*©#.
###278 Shut the front door, you know what I'm talking about?
###282 The f-bomb. It's everywhere!
###286 You hear it all the time!
###288 I honestly don't understand what the appeal is of the word.
###291 I mean, you don't sound smart when you say it.
###294 And it's really not expressing how you really feel.
###300 It's sort of a cheap shot to take.
###303 And of course you know I'm talking about the word "fine".
###309 "How you doing?" "Oh, I'm fine."
###312 Oh, really? You are?
###314 Dragging around those extra forty pounds, you're fine?
###317 Feeling like roommates with your spouse, and you're fine?
###320 You haven't had sex in four months, you're fine?
###323 Really?!
###326 I don't think so!
###329 But see, here's the deal with saying that you're fine: It's actually genius.
###334 Because if you're fine, you don't have to do anything about it.
###339 But when you think about this word "fine", it just makes me so angry.
###344 Here we are at a conference about being alive
###346 and you're going to describe the experience of being alive as "fine"?!
###352 What a flimsy and feeble word!
###355 If you're crappy, say you're crappy!
###357 If you're amazing say you're amazing!
###359 Tell the truth!
###361 And this not only goes for the social construct:
###364 "Oh, I don't want to burden you with the fact that I hate my life",
###367 or: "Hey, I'm amazing! But that would make you feel terrible."
###370 The bigger issue –
###372 The bigger issue with "fine" is that you say it to yourself.
###377 That thing that you want, I guarantee you,
###380 you've convinced yourself that you're fine not having it.
###386 That's why you're not pushing yourself.
###388 It's the areas in your life where you've given up.
###391 Where you've said,
###392 "Oh, I'm fine. My mom's never going to change,
###395 so I just can't have that conversation."
###397 "I'm fine. We've got to wait until the kids graduate, before we get divorced,
###400 so we'll just sleep in separate bedrooms."
###403 "I'm fine. I lost my job, I can barely pay my bills,
###406 but whatever – It's hard to get a job."
###411 One of the reasons why this word also just annoys me so much is,
###417 scientists have calculated –
###421 Oh yeah, I'm coming down! (Laughter)
###423 Scientists have calculated
###425 the odds
###428 of you
###429 being born.
###432 That's right. They've crunched the numbers. I see you up there.
###437 They've crunched the numbers on you –
###438 Yeah, you guys standing up, you want to sit down for this.
###442 They've crunched the numbers on you being born.
###445 And they took into account all of the wars,
###449 and the natural disasters, and the dinosaurs,
###453 and everything else.
###455 And do you realize that the odds, the odds of you,
###461 yeah, right here, put your computer away,
###463 stand up for me, Doug! (Laughter)
###467 So the odds of Doug here, turn around, say "hi" to everybody –
###470 the odds of Doug being born
###474 at the moment in time he was born,
###477 to the parents you were born to, with the DNA structure that you have,
###483 one in four hundred trillion!
###488 Isn't that amazing? Doug: I'm so lucky!
###491 Mel: Yes! You're not fine, you're fantastic!
###495 You have life-changing ideas for a reason, and it's not to torture yourself.
###501 Thank you. Thank you, Doug. (Applause)
###506 Christine was right when she said all of you could be on stage.
###510 Because all of you – we're all in this category.
###513 One in four hundred trillion.
###517 All day long you have ideas that could change your life,
###521 that could change the world, that could change the way that you feel,
###525 and what do you do with them? Nothing!
###529 (Grunts) Hopefully I won't moon you. (Laughter)
###532 You didn't pay for that. (Laughter)
###538 And I want you to just think for a minute, because we all have –
###543 I love to use the analogy "the inner snooze button" –
###546 you have these amazing ideas that bubble up.
###549 You've been watching people all day
###550 and I guarantee you, like ping pong balls – bam-bam-bam
###555 and everytime you have an idea, what do you do? – Hit the snooze!
###559 What's the first decision you made this morning?
###562 I bet it was to go back to bed.
###566 "Yeah, first decision today, I'm one in four hundred trillion,
###570 I'm going to go back to sleep."
###572 And I get it! Your bed is comfortable! It's cosy, it's warm!
###577 If you're lucky, you've got somebody that you love next to you,
###580 or in my case, I've got my husband and my two kids and possibly the dog.
###587 And the reason why I'm bringing up this first decision that you made today,
###592 and the inner snooze alarm, is because
###597 in any area of your life that you want to change,
###603 any – there's one fact that you need to know.
###607 This one:
###612 You are never going to feel like it.
###616 Ever.
###619 No one's coming, motivation isn't happening,
###622 you're never going to feel like it.
###624 Scientists call it activation energy.
###627 That's what they call the force required
###630 to get you to change from what you're doing
###632 on autopilot to do something new.
###634 So try this test tomorrow.
###637 You think you're so fancy, I know, you're attending TED.
###640 (Laughter) Try this.
###643 Tomorrow morning, set your alarm for thirty minutes earlier.
###648 And then when it goes off, take those sheets,
###651 throw them off, and stand up and start your day.
###656 No snooze, no delay,
###659 no, "I'll just wait here for five seconds because Mel's not standing here" –
###663 Do it.
###665 And the reason why I want you to do it is because you will come face to face
###670 with the physical, and I mean physical force
###674 that's required to change your behavior.
###679 Do you think that somebody who needs to lose weight
###683 ever feels like going on a diet?
###685 Of course not!
###687 You think they ever feel like eating boiled chicken and peas
###690 instead of a croissant?
###692 I don't think so!
###695 The activation energy
###697 required to get your ass away from your computer and out the front door,
###703 to go on the walk, you said that you were going to go on,
###706 is the exact same amount of force that it takes you
###709 to push yourself out of a warm bed and into a cold room.
###714 What's interesting about being an adult
###717 is that when you become eighteen,
###721 nobody tells you that it's now going to be your job to parent yourself.
###727 And by "parent yourself",
###729 I mean it's your job to make yourself do the crap you don't want to do,
###735 so you can be everything that you're supposed to be.
###740 And you're so damn busy waiting to feel like it.
###744 And you're never going to!
###746 My son never feels like getting off his DS. That's my job!
###750 Get off the damn DS!
###753 Kendall, clean up the Barbies!
###755 If you're going to have a nude party in my bathroom, at least clean it up!
###759 (Laughter)
###762 God, chew with your mouth closed! We're not a barn, for crying out loud!
###768 Alright, dinner is coming, get out of the pantry.
###774 As parents, and you were a kid,
###777 your parents make you do the things you don't feel like doing.
###780 Because you won't. Ever.
###783 Not now, not then, not ever!
###787 And even when you get good at something,
###789 you'll figure out something else you don't want to do.
###791 And then you'll plato out, get bored, "I hate this job. Blah blah boring."
###795 But will you look for a new one? No! You'll just bitch about that one.
###799 It's very, very simple to get what you want.
###803 But it's not easy.
###808 You have to force yourself.
###812 And I mean force.
###816 And the reason why I use the word "force" –
###818 when Roz was up here and talking about the emotion tracking,
###822 and she had the picture of two sides of the brain –
###825 I look at the brain the exact same way.
###829 Only I describe one side of your brain as autopilot
###832 and the other side as emergency brake.
###834 That's the only two speeds you get: autopilot, emergency brake.
###838 And guess which one your brain likes better: autopilot.
###842 You've had the experience where you've driven to work and you get there
###845 and you're like, "Oh my God, I don't remember ever driving here."
###848 (Laughter)
###849 You weren't drunk! That was your brain on autopilot.
###853 It was functioning just at this level.
###856 And the problem with your mind is that anytime
###859 you do anything that's different from your normal routine,
###862 guess what your brain does — emergency brake!
###866 And it has that reaction for everything. Everything!
###869 You walk into the kitchen and see
###870 everybody's left their breakfast dishes for you.
###873 And you think for the hundredth time, "I'm going to kill them.
###876 In fact I'm gonna leave it here and I'm going to make them do it."
###879 But that's not your normal routine, is it?
###882 So your mind goes: emergency brake!
###884 And you go right into autopilot.
###886 "I'll just load it, and be pissed, and then not have sex.
###888 That's what I'm going to do." (Laughter) (Applause)
###894 So, when I say "force",
###896 anything that's a break from your routine is going to require force.
###902 And if you think about your life,
###904 it's kind of funny because we are kids and then we become adults,
###909 and we spend so much time trying to push our life
###911 into some sort of stable routine,
###913 and then we grow bored of it!
###915 You wake up at the same time every day, you have largely the same breakfast,
###919 you drive to work the same way, show up at work, look busy,
###922 avoid making calls, update Facebook,
###924 you attend a meeting and doodle the whole time,
###927 go back and update Facebook, make plans for the evening,
###929 you look busy some more, then drive home the same way,
###932 you eat largely the same dinner or a variety of it,
###934 you watch the same kind of media,
###936 and then you go to bed, and do the same thing all over again!
###939 No wonder you're bored out of your mind!
###941 It's the routine that's killing you.
###944 I have this theory about why people get stuck in life.
###948 So, most of you've probably taken your Basic Psych 101 class,
###951 and you've bumped into Abraham Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs"?
###956 Well, your body is kinda cool. Because you have these basic needs.
###961 And your body is wired to send you signals.
###966 If you need food, what do you feel?
###971 If you need water, what do you feel?
###974 If you need sex, what do you feel? (Laughter) Thank you.
###980 I think when you feel stuck or dissatisfied in your life,
###984 it's a signal.
###986 And it's not a signal that your life is broken.
###990 It's a signal that one of your most basic needs are not being met.
###995 Your need for exploration.
###997 Everything about your life, about your body, grows!
###1001 Your cells regenerate, your hair, your nails,
###1003 everything grows for your entire life.
###1007 And your soul needs exploration and growth.
###1011 And the only way you'll get it is by forcing yourself to be uncomfortable.
###1017 Forcing yourself to get outside,
###1022 out of your head. Thank you.
###1024 If you're in your head, you're behind enemy lines.
###1027 That is not God talking, okay? It's not!
###1030 In fact, if I put a speaker on it and we broadcast what you say to yourself,
###1034 we would institutionalize you. (Laughter)
###1038 You would not hang out with people that talk to you
###1040 the way you talk to yourself.
###1042 So get out of your head!
###1045 Your feelings! Your feelings are screwing you!
###1049 I don't care how you feel! I care about what you want!
###1053 And if you listen to how you feel,
###1056 when it comes to what you want – you will not get it.
###1061 Because you will never feel like it.
###1064 And you need to get outside your comfort zone.
###1067 It's not about taking risks,
###1069 it's about getting outside your comfort zone.
###1073 Those first three seconds when you push yourself out of bed, they blow.
###1078 But once you're up, it's great.
###1082 Those first three seconds when you're sitting here in a stadium like this
###1086 and somebody says, "Get up and come dance,"
###1089 and you think, "Oh, I should do that,"
###1091 and then you're like, "Uhmm."
###1094 That experience that you had when you had the impulse to do it
###1100 and then you didn't do the activation energy
###1103 required to force yourself,
###1106 your emergency brake got pulled – "I'm sitting right here.
###1109 I'm not going up with those crazy people, I don't like to dance..."
###1114 What happened for me is I came up, and I bumped into Rachel,
###1117 and then we started talking, and next thing you know, she's tweeting.
###1121 And we're friends. And – boom! Get outside.
###1125 That's where the magic is.
###1127 That's where the one in four hundred trillion exists.
###1134 So everything I do – oh, OK, this is the last part. Sorry.
###1138 So one more thing that you can use, I call it the five-second-rule.
###1142 Your mind can process a facial expression in 33 milliseconds.
###1150 It can move pretty damn quick.
###1153 The other thing that it does very quickly
###1156 is if you have one of those little impulses that are pulling you,
###1161 if you don't marry it with an action within five seconds,
###1165 you pull the emergency brake and kill the idea.
###1167 Kill it!
###1169 If you have the impulse to get up and come dance while the band is playing,
###1173 if you don't stand up in five seconds,
###1175 you're going to pull the emergency brake.
###1178 If you have an impulse about,
###1181 you were inspired by somebody's speech today,
###1183 and you don't do something within five seconds
###1186 – write a note, send yourself a text –
###1189 anything physical to marry it with the idea,
###1192 you will pull the emergency brake and kill the idea.
###1196 Your problem isn't ideas. Your problem is you don't act on them.
###1200 You kill them. It's not my fault. It's not anybody's fault.
###1206 You're doing it to yourself. Stop it!
###1210 I'm counting on you. One in four hundred trillion.
###1215 You got stuff to do!
###1217 And it's not going to happen in your head.
###1220 So I want you to practice this today.
###1224 When we go off to party, thank God it's coming soon,
###1226 because I think we all could use a cocktail,
###1230 I want you to practice the five-second-rule.
###1233 You see somebody and you think you have an impulse,
###1236 they look interesting? Walk over there!
###1239 You were inspired by somebody and you have a request?
###1242 Make it!
###1244 That's why you're here!
###1248 Experiment with it, and I think you'll be shocked about what happens.
###1252 And one more thing, I want you to know that everything that I do,
###1256 whether it's the radio show, or the television show,
###1258 or the book that I wrote, or the column,
###1261 it's for you.
###1263 And if there is anything that I can do,
###1267 if I can do anything to make you do the things you don't want to do,
###1272 so you can have what you want, I will do it.
###1276 But you need to walk over, you need to open your mouth,
###1280 and you need to make the request.
###1282 You got it? Good. Go do it.
###1286 (Applause)
###1292 Thank you! Thank you, yes! Stand up!
###1295 You have the impulse, stand up! Thank you!
