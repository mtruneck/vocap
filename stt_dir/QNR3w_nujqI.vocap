###0 new world.
###4 Their job is to make money for the British trading companies that sent them here.
###11 The land they seize seems to be the right place to exploit.
###17 Forests and rivers, coasts and lakes owned by no one.
###24 But not all native Americans succumbed to European diseases.
###29 And this land is neither empty
###33  nor uninhabited.
###38 It is the land of the Powhatan, more than fourteen thousand people living in
###44 small communities,
###45 around two hundred villages on the coast and along rivers,
###49 in large houses surrounded by cleared forests and mixed fields of squash, beans
###55 and corn.
###57 These are farmers and hunters.
###66 There is no gold,
###67 no silver, that settlers dreamed of.
###72 Just the land and its people.
###99 For a while
###100 the settlers and the natives managed to co-exist.
###133 This land is rich with resources that Europe lacks.
###142 In the long run
###143 resources that are far more valuable than gold and silver.
###155 And there's more than enough for everyone.
###164 Europeans wanted to travel west to the great empires of Asia.
###169 Instead the new world they find amazes them
###173 with its natural abundance.
###180 They discovered almost miraculous unbelievable quantities of fish in these estuaries and rivers.
###186 One particular kind of fish which
###188 very much impressed settlers
###190 was the river herring or alewife as it's otherwise called,
###195 and seasonally these would ascend the rivers to spawn from the sea
###199 in their millions.
###200 For example in the Potomac river,
###202 near Washington DC,
###205 during the eighteenth century, something like seven hundred and fifty
###209 million alewife were caught, just from that one river in one year.
###213 It was a remarkable abundance and people
###217 described the rivers as having more fish than water.
###221 Whole shoals are caught in the settlers' nets.
###225 In the eighteenth century
###226 hundreds of thousands of tons are caught
###229 and shipped in one single year and sent from North America to England,
###234 Portugal and Spain.
###236 Fishing boats sink under the weight of their captures,
###239 and the colonies thrive.
###242 It takes only two hundred years to achieve what had taken a thousand years
###247 in Europe.
###248 Overfishing.
###250 Fishing tends to remove the biggest oldest individuals from the population,
###255 and by doing this,
###256 it changes the selected pressures on the population
###260 so that fish begin to
###262 grow more slowly
###264 they reach reproductive maturity at a smaller size and earlier in life.
###269 And these things all reduce the productivity of a population.
###280 Fish are salted, hacked and sent home for money.
###291 Along with them the settlers send another resource that the old world is desperate for.
###302 It is said that there are trees as far as the eye can see.
###307 Such that a squirrel starting off at the Atlantic coast
###310 need never touch the ground
###312 to ** to Georgia.
###315 This is so different from the Europe they left behind.
###318 They have finally found a replacement for something that is disappearing at home.
###324 An infinite accessible source of the raw material of the age.
###332 The forests must fall if the settlers are to succeed.
###345 From now on
###346 the trees are doomed.
###351 When the first settlers arrived in the new world
###354 they found forests that they had never seen in Europe.
###357 Endless forests with huge trees penetrating into the heart of the land
###362 was also a woe against the forest. The ax became the yankee emblem.
###367 At the same time forests would degrade resources that the land had to offer.
###372 You could make plenty of money exporting timber in Europe would have become expensive
###376 and so the greatest forest destruction in history now took place.
###387 The clearing of forests that seemed to belong to no one and cost nothing
###391 goes so far that by the late seventeenth century many areas of the Caribbean and
###396 the Atlantic islands are completely bald.
###416 An incredible amount of wood
###418 is really squandered in this country for fuel.
###421 "Day and night, all winter for nearly half a year in all rooms a fire is kept going"
###428 observes a European traveller.
###431 Wood consumption in the forests of New England
###434 just like in Europe,
###435 is out of control.
###438 For fuel, for building and to clear agricultural land.
###442 The resources in this vast continent
###445 seem to be inexhaustible,
###447 but in time
###448 fish stocks will dwindle in the Americas too.
###453 They create this new world
###456 in the image of the one they left.
###467 Europeans change America by what they take away
###471 but they change this continent even more
###474 by what they bring with them.
###486 They come in search of their own land,
###488 something almost impossible to find in Europe.
###493 They come in search of religious freedom,
###495 in search of a better life.
###498 They believe they are responsible for their own success
###501 and happiness.
###504 For the first time women settlers come too, and they bring the whole way of life with them.
###518 They bring animals and plants
###520 that are all new to the American continent.
###550 Livestock and grains from Europe will transform the new world and make it a true New England.
###568 With the newly imported plough
###570 they will leave little land untilled.
###576 This domesticated livestock and little tools have never been seen on this continent.
###583 An environmental revolution takes place.
###588 In no time
###589 their European wheat is growing
###591 in this foreign soil.
###595 Wheat, barley, oats and rye are brought to America.
###600 But in the process some less welcome guests **
###610 Europeans introduced
###611 crops such as wheat to the Americas, but in the bags of seed they brought with them
###615 them to the Americas they also brought along seeds for weeds
###620 dandelions,
###621 other kinds of weeds and these are everywhere in the Americas now.
###627 From the most insignificant weed
###629 to the continent's greatest mammal, the bison,
###632 nothing is untouched.
###637 America's native flora and fauna
###639 is forever changed.
###645 Where the bison once reined,
###647 cattle soon roam.
###652 To the settlers' delight
###654 their livestock multiplies more quickly here than it did in Europe.
###659 In a few hundred years
###661 European cows eat away the American grass
###664 and trample the soil,
###666 deposit their excrement and distribute the seeds of the weeds.
###678 The invasion of European insects
###680 and animals changes the American landscape for ever.
###692 Horses, pigs, sheep,
###695 goats, chickens
###696 and huge herds of cattle take over North and South America.
###702 The cattle alone doubles in numbers every fifteen months
###707 and feed the settlers.
###713 The new world settlers defend themselves inside sturdy forts
###718 but there are no shortages of any kind.
###722 Meat has become one of the cheapest food in the Americas.
###727 They are the best-fed people in the world.
###736 Hides are in great demand in America as well as in Europe.
###741 And fur from the wild animals they shoot brings them a steady export income.
###747 Some like the beaver are hunted almost to extinction.
###755 Settlers are not forced to adapt to the landscape.
###758 They domesticate and dominate it.
###763 Most trees are cut down and turned into pasture,
###766 in gardens where all kinds of vegetables
###769 and root crops that we know in England
###770 grow in profusion.
###774 They replace the trees they have cut down with their own trees.
###778 Europeans bring peaches, pears and plums.
###782 They bring figs
###783 olives and bananas.
###791 And their trees flourish.
###799 They never know
