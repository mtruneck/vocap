2
0:0:1,266 --> 0:0:1,69
JOSH HADDOW: Hi.


3
0:0:1,69 --> 0:0:2,63
My name's Josh.


4
0:0:2,63 --> 0:0:4,1
I'm about to take some acid.


5
0:0:4,1 --> 0:0:7,38
And then I'm going to go to a
open comedy mic night and tell


6
0:0:7,38 --> 0:0:9,13
us some of my original jokes.


7
0:0:9,13 --> 0:0:37,71
[MUSIC PLAYING]


8
0:0:37,71 --> 0:0:38,16
JAMIE TAETE: Hi.


9
0:0:38,16 --> 0:0:40,41
I'm Jamie Taete, Vice
journalist.


10
0:0:40,41 --> 0:0:43,1
And I like watching people
trip on acid.


11
0:0:43,1 --> 0:0:45,69
I especially like watching
people trip on acid in really


12
0:0:45,69 --> 0:0:47,2
awkward situations.


13
0:0:47,2 --> 0:0:49,54
Tonight, I'm going to be going
with our friend, Josh, as he


14
0:0:49,54 --> 0:0:52,27
performs open mic nights
in London on acid.


15
0:0:52,27 --> 0:0:55,838



16
0:0:55,838 --> 0:0:57,105
Hi, Josh.


17
0:0:57,105 --> 0:0:58,355
JOSH HADDOW: All right, Jamie.


18
0:0:58,355 --> 0:1:1,67



19
0:1:1,67 --> 0:1:3,17
JAMIE TAETE: When we were
filming downstairs a minute


20
0:1:3,17 --> 0:1:4,41
ago, you seemed a bit worried.


21
0:1:4,41 --> 0:1:5,222
What was going on?


22
0:1:5,222 --> 0:1:5,63
JOSH HADDOW: Yeah.


23
0:1:5,63 --> 0:1:8,47
You were definitely out of the
room for, like, an uncalled


24
0:1:8,47 --> 0:1:10,21
for amount of time.


25
0:1:10,21 --> 0:1:12,144
JAMIE TAETE: I think it was
probably about four minutes.


26
0:1:12,144 --> 0:1:13,394
JOSH HADDOW: Yeah.


27
0:1:13,394 --> 0:1:15,15



28
0:1:15,15 --> 0:1:16,8
Four long, long minutes.


29
0:1:16,8 --> 0:1:17,79
JAMIE TAETE: And how are
you feeling right now?


30
0:1:17,79 --> 0:1:20,55
Talk us through it.


31
0:1:20,55 --> 0:1:22,7
JOSH HADDOW: I think a
bit fucked, really.


32
0:1:22,7 --> 0:1:23,55
JAMIE TAETE: What
are you seeing?


33
0:1:23,55 --> 0:1:26,45
Are you getting sort of
any kind of visuals?


34
0:1:26,45 --> 0:1:28,68
JOSH HADDOW: Yeah, I can see.


35
0:1:28,68 --> 0:1:29,62
JAMIE TAETE: That's good.


36
0:1:29,62 --> 0:1:31,25
JOSH HADDOW: And then,
do you know what?


37
0:1:31,25 --> 0:1:33,67
My mind's gone about three
triples inside of itself now.


38
0:1:33,67 --> 0:1:34,36
[LAUGHTER]


39
0:1:34,36 --> 0:1:38,7
JOSH HADDOW: I can't fucking
understand what's going on.


40
0:1:38,7 --> 0:1:38,92
I don't know.


41
0:1:38,92 --> 0:1:40,63
It's just so weird.


42
0:1:40,63 --> 0:1:43,14
I could tell it was starting
to kick in because, well,


43
0:1:43,14 --> 0:1:45,13
everything was getting a lot
more vibrant to start with.


44
0:1:45,13 --> 0:1:46,67
The visual started
coming along.


45
0:1:46,67 --> 0:1:48,79
You held your hand out in front
of me and it was, like,


46
0:1:48,79 --> 0:1:49,93
withering away.


47
0:1:49,93 --> 0:1:51,73
And I felt embarrassed
to tell you.


48
0:1:51,73 --> 0:1:53,27
I felt like you're going
to take it as an


49
0:1:53,27 --> 0:1:55,2
insult, so I didn't.


50
0:1:55,2 --> 0:1:56,23
Am I going to get
through this?


51
0:1:56,23 --> 0:1:57,585
JAMIE TAETE: Yeah, you're going
to get through this.


52
0:1:57,585 --> 0:1:58,86
JOSH HADDOW: I'm probably
going to throw up


53
0:1:58,86 --> 0:2:0,5
by the end of it.


54
0:2:0,5 --> 0:2:1,972
JAMIE TAETE: Are you
feeling nauseous?


55
0:2:1,972 --> 0:2:4,57
JOSH HADDOW: Everything's
very trailey.


56
0:2:4,57 --> 0:2:9,518
So that's happening.


57
0:2:9,518 --> 0:2:11,12
Can you take care of me?


58
0:2:11,12 --> 0:2:11,51
[LAUGHTER]


59
0:2:11,51 --> 0:2:12,51
JAMIE TAETE: Oh, Josh.


60
0:2:12,51 --> 0:2:14,66
I'll take care of you.


61
0:2:14,66 --> 0:2:16,47
JOSH HADDOW: Oh, my God.


62
0:2:16,47 --> 0:2:19,0
What the fuck am I doing?


63
0:2:19,0 --> 0:2:21,72
I was kind of not enjoying it.


64
0:2:21,72 --> 0:2:25,71
And not giving myself a chance
to enjoy it because I was so


65
0:2:25,71 --> 0:2:29,64
busy dealing with the whole
premise and the reason that we


66
0:2:29,64 --> 0:2:30,9
were doing it.


67
0:2:30,9 --> 0:2:31,54
Do you know what's really
hard to, like,


68
0:2:31,54 --> 0:2:32,61
comprehend right now?


69
0:2:32,61 --> 0:2:33,45
JAMIE TAETE: What?


70
0:2:33,45 --> 0:2:38,82
JOSH HADDOW: The fact that I'm
in a documentary right now.


71
0:2:38,82 --> 0:2:41,62
It's just such an intense
environment to start with.


72
0:2:41,62 --> 0:2:43,532
[LAUGHTER]


73
0:2:43,532 --> 0:2:44,49
JAMIE TAETE: OK.


74
0:2:44,49 --> 0:2:47,385
JOSH HADDOW: Doubled onto the
fact that I'm on acid.


75
0:2:47,385 --> 0:2:52,52



76
0:2:52,52 --> 0:2:53,94
JAMIE TAETE: You're panicking
a little bit, but you don't


77
0:2:53,94 --> 0:2:55,97
need to panic at all.


78
0:2:55,97 --> 0:2:59,98
JOSH HADDOW: In the flat, my
mental state went from not


79
0:2:59,98 --> 0:3:2,945
great to pretty awful, really.


80
0:3:2,945 --> 0:3:5,73
As it became apparent that we
were going to have to leave


81
0:3:5,73 --> 0:3:9,7
soon, I just, my mind
was, like, shit.


82
0:3:9,7 --> 0:3:11,68
Like, I'm only just getting used
to this environment of


83
0:3:11,68 --> 0:3:14,1
having to think about what
I'm going to do.


84
0:3:14,1 --> 0:3:17,71
And I got that thing where you
kind of, everything's quite


85
0:3:17,71 --> 0:3:22,64
sort of focused in on just the
fact that I didn't want to go.


86
0:3:22,64 --> 0:3:22,86
No.


87
0:3:22,86 --> 0:3:23,63
What are we doing?


88
0:3:23,63 --> 0:3:24,46
JAMIE TAETE: We're getting
in the cab.


89
0:3:24,46 --> 0:3:24,63
JOSH HADDOW: OK.


90
0:3:24,63 --> 0:3:25,16
OK.


91
0:3:25,16 --> 0:3:25,98
JAMIE TAETE: You ready?


92
0:3:25,98 --> 0:3:27,36
JOSH HADDOW: Can I just have
a little bit more water?


93
0:3:27,36 --> 0:3:32,55



94
0:3:32,55 --> 0:3:33,397
JAMIE TAETE: Are you done?


95
0:3:33,397 --> 0:3:34,647
You ready to go?


96
0:3:34,647 --> 0:3:37,212



97
0:3:37,212 --> 0:3:40,386
JOSH HADDOW: I can't work out
the stairs let alone--


98
0:3:40,386 --> 0:3:41,465
OK, let's just--


99
0:3:41,465 --> 0:3:41,93
No.


100
0:3:41,93 --> 0:3:43,72
Fuckin' hell.


101
0:3:43,72 --> 0:3:44,93
JAMIE TAETE: I'll be with
you on the stairs.


102
0:3:44,93 --> 0:3:45,53
JOSH HADDOW: Cheers, man.


103
0:3:45,53 --> 0:3:47,26
Thank you.


104
0:3:47,26 --> 0:3:48,7
It was just becoming
more and more


105
0:3:48,7 --> 0:3:50,42
like, OK, this is happening.


106
0:3:50,42 --> 0:3:51,83
This is happening.


107
0:3:51,83 --> 0:3:55,106
That pressure was just sort of
insurmountable at that point.


108
0:3:55,106 --> 0:3:56,857
I can't do this.


109
0:3:56,857 --> 0:3:58,5
I don't know.


110
0:3:58,5 --> 0:3:58,17
JAMIE TAETE: All right.


111
0:3:58,17 --> 0:3:58,57
Let's just--


112
0:3:58,57 --> 0:4:0,66
Shall we get in the cab and
see, like, you'll be in a


113
0:4:0,66 --> 0:4:0,86
different room.


114
0:4:0,86 --> 0:4:2,1
JOSH HADDOW: Oh, no,
no, no, no, no.


115
0:4:2,1 --> 0:4:2,31
OK.


116
0:4:2,31 --> 0:4:5,66
Just two seconds backwards
from there.


117
0:4:5,66 --> 0:4:7,88
Let me just process that.


118
0:4:7,88 --> 0:4:11,41
I feel like a lot of that
pressure was definitely backed


119
0:4:11,41 --> 0:4:13,0
up by myself.


120
0:4:13,0 --> 0:4:15,1
And you guys could probably
sense that.


121
0:4:15,1 --> 0:4:18,269
So you were sort of wanting
to push me along.


122
0:4:18,269 --> 0:4:20,24
It was horrible, really,
in the cab.


123
0:4:20,24 --> 0:4:23,87
I mean, apart from anything
it was ruining my trip.


124
0:4:23,87 --> 0:4:26,57
On top of the fact that I was,
you know, literally on the way


125
0:4:26,57 --> 0:4:27,19
to the place.


126
0:4:27,19 --> 0:4:31,475
And every second was taking me
closer to it, which meant


127
0:4:31,475 --> 0:4:35,44
there was a sort of very sharp
growth of dread in my mindset.


128
0:4:35,44 --> 0:4:38,1



129
0:4:38,1 --> 0:4:40,33
Now we're on the way
now, aren't we?


130
0:4:40,33 --> 0:4:42,1
For all I knew at that point,
you were going to shove me on


131
0:4:42,1 --> 0:4:44,93
a stage in a Western theater in
front of, like, thousands


132
0:4:44,93 --> 0:4:47,19
of people expected me to
do a song and dance.


133
0:4:47,19 --> 0:4:49,59
Like, I literally
have no idea.


134
0:4:49,59 --> 0:4:49,86
OK.


135
0:4:49,86 --> 0:4:53,53
Let's just go for it and
see what happens, eh?


136
0:4:53,53 --> 0:4:56,75
I'm going to go walk here.


137
0:4:56,75 --> 0:4:57,736
Is this a point?


138
0:4:57,736 --> 0:4:59,88
It's so intense.


139
0:4:59,88 --> 0:5:1,97
JAMIE TAETE: It's a picture
of Michael Jackson.


140
0:5:1,97 --> 0:5:4,451
JOSH HADDOW: It's so, so
intense right now.


141
0:5:4,451 --> 0:5:7,765
He's dead, newly dead.


142
0:5:7,765 --> 0:5:10,3
The environment around
Shaftesbury


143
0:5:10,3 --> 0:5:12,3
Avenue is so intense.


144
0:5:12,3 --> 0:5:15,38
It felt very much like I'd got
to this sort of culminating


145
0:5:15,38 --> 0:5:20,41
scene in some action film where
something very, very bad


146
0:5:20,41 --> 0:5:21,632
is about to happen.


147
0:5:21,632 --> 0:5:23,23
And it's very, very close.


148
0:5:23,23 --> 0:5:27,74
Like, if it was a heist film,
like, we were about to go into


149
0:5:27,74 --> 0:5:28,52
the bank or something.


150
0:5:28,52 --> 0:5:29,55
I was going to get shot.


151
0:5:29,55 --> 0:5:32,826
[CITY NOISE]


152
0:5:32,826 --> 0:5:35,25
JOSH HADDOW: Is it like, 3:00 in
the afternoon or is there a


153
0:5:35,25 --> 0:5:36,53
bunch of kids around?


154
0:5:36,53 --> 0:5:38,43
It's amazing.


155
0:5:38,43 --> 0:5:39,89
I didn't feel like I should
be around them


156
0:5:39,89 --> 0:5:41,44
in my state of mind.


157
0:5:41,44 --> 0:5:44,3
Not that I was going to do
anything or, like, not like I


158
0:5:44,3 --> 0:5:44,75
was dangerous.


159
0:5:44,75 --> 0:5:46,891
But it just felt wrong.


160
0:5:46,891 --> 0:5:47,27
Yeah.


161
0:5:47,27 --> 0:5:51,38
Getting to the club
which interesting.


162
0:5:51,38 --> 0:5:52,53
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]


163
0:5:52,53 --> 0:5:56,89
when you empty my wallet and
leave me sexually frustrating?


164
0:5:56,89 --> 0:6:0,124
And babe, you've been doing
that all fucking week.


165
0:6:0,124 --> 0:6:1,98
[LAUGHTER]


166
0:6:1,98 --> 0:6:3,72
JOSH HADDOW: Yeah, I feel
like I've bullied


167
0:6:3,72 --> 0:6:5,8
myself into doing it.


168
0:6:5,8 --> 0:6:6,885
JAMIE TAETE: That's not good.


169
0:6:6,885 --> 0:6:7,825
You OK to go on?


170
0:6:7,825 --> 0:6:8,46
JOSH HADDOW: Well, fuck it.


171
0:6:8,46 --> 0:6:9,832
I'm here now.


172
0:6:9,832 --> 0:6:13,463
This just looks like a cruel
human experiment doesn't it?


173
0:6:13,463 --> 0:6:15,502
That's fucking what it is.


174
0:6:15,502 --> 0:6:18,834
[LAUGHTER]


175
0:6:18,834 --> 0:6:19,865
JAMIE TAETE: Do you think
you can handle it?


176
0:6:19,865 --> 0:6:22,166
Do you think you can
mentally handle it?


177
0:6:22,166 --> 0:6:23,73
JOSH HADDOW: Probably not.


178
0:6:23,73 --> 0:6:24,57
Everything like that.


179
0:6:24,57 --> 0:6:25,77
What is that, like,
some sort of--


180
0:6:25,77 --> 0:6:26,732
JAMIE TAETE: He banged
the mic.


181
0:6:26,732 --> 0:6:28,175
JOSH HADDOW: But is that
like some sort of--


182
0:6:28,175 --> 0:6:29,618
MALE SPEAKER: At that moment
I learned a very


183
0:6:29,618 --> 0:6:32,3
important life lesson.


184
0:6:32,3 --> 0:6:32,46
JOSH HADDOW: Am I getting--


185
0:6:32,46 --> 0:6:33,19
What is going on?


186
0:6:33,19 --> 0:6:34,58
You must know.


187
0:6:34,58 --> 0:6:36,23
What's going on?


188
0:6:36,23 --> 0:6:38,68
Up to that point, basically,
everything had become sort of


189
0:6:38,68 --> 0:6:43,71
like this black hole of
despair around me.


190
0:6:43,71 --> 0:6:48,61
It sounds like it's hyperbole,
but honestly, it was horrible.


191
0:6:48,61 --> 0:6:50,58
It just seemed like I was
faced with the most just


192
0:6:50,58 --> 0:6:51,5
unclimbable mountain.


193
0:6:51,5 --> 0:6:55,65
I was just like, if I go up
there, I'm just not going to


194
0:6:55,65 --> 0:6:56,97
be able to face the crowd.


195
0:6:56,97 --> 0:6:58,63
They're going to start
jeering me.


196
0:6:58,63 --> 0:7:0,69
Because I'm probably not going
to be able to say anything.


197
0:7:0,69 --> 0:7:1,52
I'll be so frightened.


198
0:7:1,52 --> 0:7:5,6
MALE SPEAKER: Make some
noise for Josh Haddow!


199
0:7:5,6 --> 0:7:6,88
JOSH HADDOW: So when they called
my name out and they


200
0:7:6,88 --> 0:7:10,37
cheered, I just remember sort
of going into auto function.


201
0:7:10,37 --> 0:7:14,185
Part of me was just like, you're
going to do it now.


202
0:7:14,185 --> 0:7:16,34
It was definitely some part
of me just sort of


203
0:7:16,34 --> 0:7:17,346
taking me up there.


204
0:7:17,346 --> 0:7:20,6
And it felt like destiny.


205
0:7:20,6 --> 0:7:21,96
Getting up there and
then it was silent.


206
0:7:21,96 --> 0:7:24,53
And it was suddenly like,
because it was silent, like,


207
0:7:24,53 --> 0:7:27,85
my mind kind of took a breath.


208
0:7:27,85 --> 0:7:31,76
There's this space for me
to think, I may as well


209
0:7:31,76 --> 0:7:32,87
just tell my joke.


210
0:7:32,87 --> 0:7:40,82
So the SAS, they've not got
any people left in them.


211
0:7:40,82 --> 0:7:43,95
So they have interviews,
open interviews.


212
0:7:43,95 --> 0:7:46,67
And a farmer comes along
and he goes, I


213
0:7:46,67 --> 0:7:47,65
want to join the SAS.


214
0:7:47,65 --> 0:7:48,52
I'm really brave.


215
0:7:48,52 --> 0:7:51,3
And they say, well, what's
brave about you,


216
0:7:51,3 --> 0:7:52,885
what in your life?


217
0:7:52,885 --> 0:7:58,28
And he says, well, one day,
I was out farming.


218
0:7:58,28 --> 0:8:4,78
And the tractor broke down three
miles away from where I


219
0:8:4,78 --> 0:8:7,47
lived with my wife,
Mrs. Farmer.


220
0:8:7,47 --> 0:8:9,82
And she--


221
0:8:9,82 --> 0:8:10,6
the tract--


222
0:8:10,6 --> 0:8:14,71
Yeah, the tractor, the
tractor broke down.


223
0:8:14,71 --> 0:8:17,84
I looked into the tractor
engine and it


224
0:8:17,84 --> 0:8:18,68
bolted back to life.


225
0:8:18,68 --> 0:8:20,79
And it ripped one on
of my arms off.


226
0:8:20,79 --> 0:8:23,83
So I was, like, shit.


227
0:8:23,83 --> 0:8:24,92
I've only got one arm.


228
0:8:24,92 --> 0:8:26,966
And so I grabbed it--


229
0:8:26,966 --> 0:8:31,1
grabbed that arm-- and
ran all the way back.


230
0:8:31,1 --> 0:8:35,49
Mrs. Farmer, she sewed
it back on.


231
0:8:35,49 --> 0:8:36,835
And now here I am.


232
0:8:36,835 --> 0:8:38,179
And they said, that's
very brave.


233
0:8:38,179 --> 0:8:39,72
Well done.


234
0:8:39,72 --> 0:8:41,59
[LAUGHTER]


235
0:8:41,59 --> 0:8:43,516
JOSH HADDOW: You're definitely
in to the SAS.


236
0:8:43,516 --> 0:8:46,91
Then he said, thank you.


237
0:8:46,91 --> 0:8:47,341
I'll see you on Monday.


238
0:8:47,341 --> 0:8:52,31



239
0:8:52,31 --> 0:8:54,828
And now only that's it.


240
0:8:54,828 --> 0:8:57,16
MALE SPEAKER: Give it
up for [INAUDIBLE].


241
0:8:57,16 --> 0:8:59,385
JOSH HADDOW: As I said, at that
point, all the anxiety


242
0:8:59,385 --> 0:9:1,52
was kind of, was melting away.


243
0:9:1,52 --> 0:9:4,54
And I was starting to
have fun, actually.


244
0:9:4,54 --> 0:9:6,14
It was like, chariots
of fucking fire.


245
0:9:6,14 --> 0:9:7,49
I was like, I'm going.


246
0:9:7,49 --> 0:9:10,11
I'm like, and I'm
on my way now.


247
0:9:10,11 --> 0:9:12,7
And then literally, like almost
running into your arms,


248
0:9:12,7 --> 0:9:15,6
like, I fucking did it!


249
0:9:15,6 --> 0:9:17,0
Seriously, violins started
playing in my head.


250
0:9:17,0 --> 0:9:18,48
It was like da, da, da.


251
0:9:18,48 --> 0:9:20,63
Fucking amazing.


252
0:9:20,63 --> 0:9:22,8
JAMIE TAETE: When you
were going up I was


253
0:9:22,8 --> 0:9:24,13
very anxious for you.


254
0:9:24,13 --> 0:9:26,844
And I did feel a bit like
I was going to die.


255
0:9:26,844 --> 0:9:30,2
But I thought you did a lot
better than I thought


256
0:9:30,2 --> 0:9:30,855
you were going to.


257
0:9:30,855 --> 0:9:32,535
How long do you think you
were on stage for?


258
0:9:32,535 --> 0:9:33,445
JOSH HADDOW: Probably
about an hour.


259
0:9:33,445 --> 0:9:35,26
[LAUGHTER]


260
0:9:35,26 --> 0:9:38,41
JOSH HADDOW: I remember just
being very, very happy.


261
0:9:38,41 --> 0:9:40,22
And I was still tripping
quite hard.


262
0:9:40,22 --> 0:9:40,98
So it was really cool.


263
0:9:40,98 --> 0:9:43,83
Because it was like, I
could enjoy my trip.


264
0:9:43,83 --> 0:9:46,24
And although I was in quite an
intimidating environment, I


265
0:9:46,24 --> 0:9:48,47
felt so invincible.


266
0:9:48,47 --> 0:9:51,82
I felt like I'd achieved such
a massive thing that that


267
0:9:51,82 --> 0:9:53,21
threatening environment
was really


268
0:9:53,21 --> 0:9:54,44
not threatening anymore.


269
0:9:54,44 --> 0:9:57,68
It's just quite fun
to play around in.


270
0:9:57,68 --> 0:10:1,1
And my inhibitions completely
dropped, probably so far that


271
0:10:1,1 --> 0:10:4,705
I probably annoyed and pissed
off quite a lot of the public


272
0:10:4,705 --> 0:10:7,13
I interacted with.


273
0:10:7,13 --> 0:10:8,73
JAMIE TAETE: Did you see
Josh's performance?


274
0:10:8,73 --> 0:10:9,215
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.


275
0:10:9,215 --> 0:10:10,548
JAMIE TAETE: And what did
you think of Josh as


276
0:10:10,548 --> 0:10:13,1
a first time comedian?


277
0:10:13,1 --> 0:10:14,21
MALE SPEAKER: You know,
first time was


278
0:10:14,21 --> 0:10:15,982
cool, pretty confident.


279
0:10:15,982 --> 0:10:17,708
JAMIE TAETE: Have you ever
done stand up on acid?


280
0:10:17,708 --> 0:10:19,39
MALE SPEAKER: Have I ever
done stand up on acid?


281
0:10:19,39 --> 0:10:20,175
I don't think so.


282
0:10:20,175 --> 0:10:22,6
But if you've got photos
I do apologize.


283
0:10:22,6 --> 0:10:25,1
JAMIE TAETE: What do you
think it would be like?


284
0:10:25,1 --> 0:10:27,1
MALE SPEAKER: I think you could
do it and the audience


285
0:10:27,1 --> 0:10:28,8
wouldn't actually know.


286
0:10:28,8 --> 0:10:30,6
Are you on acid?


287
0:10:30,6 --> 0:10:30,565
JOSH HADDOW: Yeah.


288
0:10:30,565 --> 0:10:31,455
MALE SPEAKER: No, seriously?


289
0:10:31,455 --> 0:10:31,9
JOSH HADDOW: Yeah.


290
0:10:31,9 --> 0:10:33,24
MALE SPEAKER: That's
fucking crazy.


291
0:10:33,24 --> 0:10:33,495
Are you serious?


292
0:10:33,495 --> 0:10:34,184
JOSH HADDOW: Yeah.


293
0:10:34,184 --> 0:10:34,618
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


294
0:10:34,618 --> 0:10:35,92
You know, so.


295
0:10:35,92 --> 0:10:37,53
JOSH HADDOW: It's just fine.


296
0:10:37,53 --> 0:10:37,99
It's nothing.


297
0:10:37,99 --> 0:10:39,39
MALE SPEAKER: But the reality
is, the reality is--


298
0:10:39,39 --> 0:10:42,25
JOSH HADDOW: Do you have any
idea what I've been though?


299
0:10:42,25 --> 0:10:43,7
JAMIE TAETE: And what about the
guy you spoke to outside?


300
0:10:43,7 --> 0:10:45,59
Do you remember much of
the conversation?


301
0:10:45,59 --> 0:10:46,87
JOSH HADDOW: I was elated.


302
0:10:46,87 --> 0:10:49,11
I was almost ecstatic and
euphoric at that point.


303
0:10:49,11 --> 0:10:52,36
So I was just carefree.


304
0:10:52,36 --> 0:10:54,43
But I just couldn't help myself,
because he was just so


305
0:10:54,43 --> 0:10:55,13
absurd to me.


306
0:10:55,13 --> 0:10:57,73
I wanted to play with him
like a kitten plays


307
0:10:57,73 --> 0:10:59,477
with a ball of wool.


308
0:10:59,477 --> 0:11:0,411
Oh, my God.


309
0:11:0,411 --> 0:11:2,75
What are you talking about?


310
0:11:2,75 --> 0:11:4,23
I thought he was a fool.


311
0:11:4,23 --> 0:11:7,88
[LAUGHTER]


312
0:11:7,88 --> 0:11:8,83
JOSH HADDOW: What I took
away from it--


313
0:11:8,83 --> 0:11:13,25
I mean, the whole night was
hugely introspective.


314
0:11:13,25 --> 0:11:14,59
It's an introspective drug.


315
0:11:14,59 --> 0:11:16,76
I felt like I was starring in my
own movie, which I actually


316
0:11:16,76 --> 0:11:18,4
was in a way.


317
0:11:18,4 --> 0:11:19,51
Can you help me light this?


318
0:11:19,51 --> 0:11:20,38
Like, I'm fucked.


319
0:11:20,38 --> 0:11:22,22
Like, I can't even light
this cigarette.


320
0:11:22,22 --> 0:11:25,56
It was all very, very strange,
and very intense, and


321
0:11:25,56 --> 0:11:26,25
introverted.


322
0:11:26,25 --> 0:11:29,935
And with acid and the way it
enhances your emotions, it


323
0:11:29,935 --> 0:11:31,44
sort of amplifies them.


324
0:11:31,44 --> 0:11:34,2
One of the emotions that it
really amplified for me was


325
0:11:34,2 --> 0:11:37,79
pride in myself, which was
really, really good.


326
0:11:37,79 --> 0:11:39,59
It was amazing.


327
0:11:39,59 --> 0:11:41,63
Achievement's only worth it if
you feel quite proud of what


328
0:11:41,63 --> 0:11:42,88
you've achieved.


329
0:11:42,88 --> 0:11:45,23



330
0:11:45,23 --> 0:11:47,75
That was actually an
amazing experience.


331
0:11:47,75 --> 0:11:48,94
It was incredibly cathartic.


332
0:11:48,94 --> 0:11:51,645
And it made be actually have an
appreciation for religion


333
0:11:51,645 --> 0:11:52,5
and things like that.


334
0:11:52,5 --> 0:11:54,99
Because I actually thought,
you know, people who spend


335
0:11:54,99 --> 0:11:57,53
their lives just doing something
for this higher


336
0:11:57,53 --> 0:12:0,63
being, that is actually
quite a nice thing.


337
0:12:0,63 --> 0:12:2,72
You feel like you're
giving something.


338
0:12:2,72 --> 0:12:5,175
But then I realized I was
equating you to my God.


339
0:12:5,175 --> 0:12:8,616



340
0:12:8,616 --> 0:12:12,56
And yeah, so that was
probably not true.


341
0:12:12,56 --> 0:12:13,5
See you later.


342
0:12:13,5 --> 0:12:15,396
Bye.


343
0:12:15,396 --> 0:12:16,75
[INAUDIBLE]


344
0:12:16,75 --> 0:12:18,0
Gotta go.


345
0:12:18,0 --> 0:14:18,0
