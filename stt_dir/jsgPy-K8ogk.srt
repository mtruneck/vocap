Hey Food Tubers, I'm Tim Shieff. Athlete,
world free running champion and also a vegan.


2
0:0:11,91 --> 0:0:17,22
So my mates here at Food Tube have come up
with a vegan friendly shepherds pie. It's


3
0:0:17,22 --> 0:0:23,359
hearty, it's healthy and you definitely don't
have to be a vegan to enjoy this.


4
0:0:23,359 --> 0:0:33,28
First thing you want, sweet potatoes. They
are one of the biggest staples of my diet.


5
0:0:33,28 --> 0:0:41,66
You want to put oil on your sweet potatoes,
sprinkle some salt on there really bring the


6
0:0:41,66 --> 0:0:48,73
flavour out and of course, the pepper. Spread
the oil around. Then they go in the oven 180


7
0:0:48,73 --> 0:0:59,33
degrees, for 35-40 minutes until they're soft.
Now, I want to make the base. Large pan, medium


8
0:0:59,33 --> 0:1:10,97
heat, drizzle in the oil. I use flax oil,
slightly healthier for you than regular oil.


9
0:1:10,97 --> 0:1:16,36
First things first for the base, celery. Right,
celery's chopped, I've got to sweat it into


10
0:1:16,36 --> 0:1:20,71
the large pan. Next two carrots. Nice to mix
the colours up then you know you're getting


11
0:1:20,71 --> 0:1:24,89
a range of vitamins and nutrients. Eat the
rainbow and you'll get everything you need!


12
0:1:24,89 --> 0:1:30,64
Carrots done, in they go. Two onions. My hand
is cramping up. I've not got the stamina in


13
0:1:30,64 --> 0:1:34,12
my hand yet, I can do all the back flips in
the world but it doesn't mean I can chop vegetables


14
0:1:34,12 --> 0:1:44,59
for more than ten minutes.
Onion done. Sweating it out with the other


15
0:1:44,59 --> 0:1:48,79
vegetables.
Don't touch, I shouldn't have done that!


16
0:1:48,79 --> 0:1:53,38
Make a space for the garlic so that it gets
in there and cooks straight away. You can


17
0:1:53,38 --> 0:1:56,39
leave the skin on it you don't need to peel
it.


18
0:1:56,39 --> 0:2:7,549
One more. Right. Onto, the rosemary.
Going against the grain, peel them. Rosemary


19
0:2:7,549 --> 0:2:11,42
onto the knife and then drop that in with
the garlic.


20
0:2:11,42 --> 0:2:16,99
Lastly for the base, coriander seeds. You
want about a tablespoon into the grinder,


21
0:2:16,99 --> 0:2:22,45
by hand, get a work out while you're preparing
dinner. Earn your food. I think that's good.


22
0:2:22,45 --> 0:2:28,93
Pour that in. Smells so good already. Now
you leave it to sweat for about ten minutes.


23
0:2:28,93 --> 0:2:34,389
Whilst those vegetables are sweating away.
You want to cut up your mushrooms.


24
0:2:34,389 --> 0:2:37,909
450 grams. I wanted to put in a whole kilo
but they told me they're wouldn't be much


25
0:2:37,909 --> 0:2:42,2
room for anything else.
Come on, that's worth a laugh or like. I'm


26
0:2:42,2 --> 0:2:54,23
not a comedian. I'm a free runner.
450 grams, beautiful white chestnut mushrooms.


27
0:2:54,23 --> 0:3:3,379
I think Mushrooms are one of the most underrated,
healthy vegetables.


28
0:3:3,379 --> 0:3:8,4
Onto the sun dried tomatoes. You want four
incredibly delicious really brings out the


29
0:3:8,4 --> 0:3:12,959
flavour in everything else around it. I went
vegan a year ago, I just wanted to try it.


30
0:3:12,959 --> 0:3:17,279
I felt results within one or two days. I've
had amounts of new energy I haven't felt since


31
0:3:17,279 --> 0:3:20,45
I was ten years old. My joints feel a lot
stronger I feel a lot healthier.


32
0:3:20,45 --> 0:3:26,2
100 grams of vegetable stock of course.
Now you leave that to cook down for ten more


33
0:3:26,2 --> 0:3:35,419
minutes.
So now that's been cooked down for ten minutes,


34
0:3:35,419 --> 0:3:40,819
you want to thicken it out with some lentils,
this is instead of your meat and now add some


35
0:3:40,819 --> 0:3:46,419
flageolet beans. That's really thickened it
up, given it some weight so you don't feel


36
0:3:46,419 --> 0:3:50,919
like you're missing anything ion the meal.
Now everything's done but the topping we're


37
0:3:50,919 --> 0:3:53,349
going to get the sweet potato out the oven
and mash it up.


38
0:3:53,349 --> 0:4:0,9
Ohh, look at that! Keep the skin in there,
good nutrients, good crunch within it. Now


39
0:4:0,9 --> 0:4:5,87
that' mashed put it down.
I'm going to ladle it out now, bring it a


40
0:4:5,87 --> 0:4:14,629
little closer. We're going to get that sweet
potato mash on top. That is looking great.


41
0:4:14,629 --> 0:4:21,3
Now we're going to add some breadcrumbs and
some rosemary. As much breadcrumbs as you


42
0:4:21,3 --> 0:4:25,0
like, give it a final topping crunch. If you
use gluten free vegetable stock as well then


43
0:4:25,0 --> 0:4:27,879
this whole recipe up to the bread is gluten
free.


44
0:4:27,879 --> 0:4:37,44
Pop it under the grill for five minutes so
it crisps up nicely. Just to finish it off.


45
0:4:37,44 --> 0:4:51,34
There we have it. Now the best part. The tasting
. Serves about 6 people. Look at every layer


46
0:4:51,34 --> 0:4:59,18
of that. Of deliciousness.
It hits every spot of your tongue. Crispy


47
0:4:59,18 --> 0:5:3,52
top then you've give the soft orange sweet
potato underneath. It's unbelievably good.


48
0:5:3,52 --> 0:5:8,539
