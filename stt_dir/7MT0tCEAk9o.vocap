###24 KARLEY SCIORTINO: Hi.
###25 I'm Karley.
###26 I've been writing my blog Slutever for four years now.
###30 I write about stuff like sex, dating, and how stressful it
###33 can be having a vagina.
###35 And then sometimes I write about weirder stuff, like
###38 fetish, obscure porn, and magical masturbation rituals.
###42 I like to think of Slutever as an
###43 investigation into sexual behavior.
###46 You know, whatever.
###48 Recently while pondering deep thoughts via the
###50 web, I got to thinking--
###52 what is the meaning of life, anyways?
###54 And who should I go out with?
###56 You know what I mean?
###57 Finding someone who wants to fuck you back
###59 can be really hard.
###61 Dating is so stressful and scary and convoluted.
###65 There's so much to think about.
###66 Does this dress make my arms look fat?
###69 How soon is too soon for anal?
###71 Do second cousins count as incest?
###74 Jeez, it's too much.
###76 To try and make some sense of it all, I decided to speak
###79 with some dating experts to ask them some of the questions
###82 us girls have always wanted to know about the mysteries of
###86 the coital dance.
###87 
###90 So I left my Brooklyn apartment and walked over to
###92 my mom's house.
###94 
###104 My mom is really into Jesus.
###106 When I was younger, she used to force me to watch programs
###108 about chastity that she taped off the God channel, or
###111 whatever it's called.
###112 Still, she started dating my dad when she was 16, which
###116 means they've been together for roughly 100 years.
###120 So she must have some tips to offer on how to find the one.
###123 OK, so what should I wear on dates?
###126 TRACEY SCIORTINO: Showing everything on a date is awful.
###129 Just don't have like a really, really tight, short
###132 skirt and low shirt.
###133 KARLEY SCIORTINO: Like, vagina-like skirts?
###135 TRACEY SCIORTINO: No vagina-like.
###136 Ever.
###137 KARLEY SCIORTINO: So what qualities do you think I
###139 should be looking for in a guy?
###142 TRACEY SCIORTINO: Um, somebody who has self-respect and
###143 respects you.
###144 Somebody with a sense of humor.
###147 He has to be handsome.
###148 And someone that you don't have to worry about, you know,
###151 when-- you know, when they walk out the door.
###153 KARLEY SCIORTINO: What about guys who have-- you know, date
###156 multiple people at once?
###157 TRACEY SCIORTINO: Don't date them, Karley.
###158 Wait.
###158 Honestly, though.
###159 Don't.
###160 KARLEY SCIORTINO: If you're on a date with someone, and it's
###161 the first date, and it's going really well, how far should
###165 you go with a guy?
###168 TRACEY SCIORTINO: You should kiss him.
###170 That's it.
###172 KARLEY SCIORTINO: Wow.
###172 My mom gave me some really good, outdated advice.
###175 But I felt like it was time to speak with a real dating
###178 professional.
###179 Someone with lots of certificates on their walls
###181 and who owns a website.
###184 So I cabbed it over to the Upper West Side to sit down
###187 with life coach and dating expert Tracey Steinberg.
###190 Tracy's helped dozens of New York women
###192 find their soul mates.
###194 So like, why not me?
###196 What advice do you give to people--
###198 we're kind of an age where you don't want
###200 to date losers anymore.
###202 You know?
###202 TRACEY STEINBERG: Good.
###204 KARLEY SCIORTINO: We're like, over dating DJs and we kind of
###206 want to meet someone that you could potentially spend the
###209 rest of your life with.
###210 TRACEY STEINBERG: I think the first thing that you should
###211 never, ever tolerate is someone who is not healthy,
###215 confident, and available.
###217 That an automatic deal breaker.
###219 That, we don't waste your time.
###221 KARLEY SCIORTINO: But what do you mean by healthy?
###222 Because actually, I tend to like guys that are just like
###225 really skinny, kind of sickly looking.
###227 And like sometimes I'm into guys that are disabled.
###230 Like crazy, mentally and physically handicapped freaks.
###237 And maybe that's not what I should be doing.
###240 TRACEY STEINBERG: I think it depends.
###241 If it's giving you the results that you want,
###243 then keep doing it.
###244 If you want different results, you have to
###246 do something different.
###247 I just think to go through life with someone who loves
###250 you so much and who you love so much is just a wonderful
###254 way to go through life.
###256 KARLEY SCIORTINO: Love is cool.
###257 TRACEY STEINBERG: Love is cool.
###258 It's really cool.
###259 KARLEY SCIORTINO: Also getting too drunk around someone is
###261 bad, 'cause you say stuff that you wish you didn't say and
###262 then you're like, that's embarrassing.
###264 TRACEY STEINBERG: Right, because you turn off your
###265 brain a lot.
###265 You're shutting off a big part of your
###267 brain when you're drunk.
###268 KARLEY SCIORTINO: Yeah.
###268 Also your vagina turns off when you're drunk.
###270 TRACEY STEINBERG: You turn off your brain--
###273 KARLEY SCIORTINO: And your vagina.
###274 Life coach Tracy taught me a lot.
###276 But it felt like it was time to get some
###277 more practical advice.
###279 So I headed back to Brooklyn to meet up with my friends
###281 Alexis Penny.
###283 Alexis is a hooker drag queen.
###285 He sucks dick for a living.
###286 And also has his own dick.
###289 So I figured he'd be the perfect person to talk to you
###291 about the more hands-on aspects of dating, like how to
###294 give a good blow job.
###296 ALEXIS PENNY: The best way to get a guy off with a blow job
###298 is actually to incorporate a hand.
###300 And really, like, what feels good is the
###302 pressure of the lips.
###304 It's not like actually that empty space within your mouth.
###307 Definitely watch the teeth.
###309 That's the biggest one.
###310 Like that's-- pretty much the worst blow job is
###313 a toothy blow job.
###314 KARLEY SCIORTINO: Like wrap your lips around
###314 your teeth like this?
###315 ALEXIS PENNY: Yeah.
###315 Wrap your lips around your teeth.
###317 I, like, made a concerted effort when I was younger to
###320 get rid of my gag reflex.
###322 I like to do sort of like a, like a swirling motion--
###326 KARLEY SCIORTINO: With your tongue?
###326 ALEXIS PENNY: Yeah.
###327 So it'd be like--
###329 and that way you're getting like a lot of sensation.
###332 You're basically like masturbating a
###333 guy with your mouth.
###334 KARLEY SCIORTINO: You don't want to go at
###335 the head and be like--
###336 ALEXIS PENNY: No.
###338 KARLEY SCIORTINO: What is the deal with balls?
###340 ALEXIS PENNY: Balls are really weird.
###342 KARLEY SCIORTINO: OMG.
###343 It seems like everyone has really strong opinions when it
###345 comes to love.
###347 But before I could call it a day, I needed to find out what
###349 my friend Dr. Leah Kelly had to say about all this.
###352 She's a neuroscientist, so I knew she'd use her smart
###355 powers to tell me what happens in our brains
###358 when we fall in love.
###360 KARLEY SCIORTINO: So Leah, what happens in your brain
###363 when you fall in love?
###364 DR. LEAH KELLY: Well, they've put people in love in brain
###368 scanners, and what they see is the same area light up that is
###375 rewarding, say, when you take cocaine.
###378 So you get this rush of this
###380 neurotransmitter called dopamine.
###382 And this is actually different to what's going on in your
###385 brain in relation to sex.
###387 So sex and love are not necessarily the same thing.
###391 But when you have sex with the same person, what happens over
###395 time is that you start to form an attachment.
###398 And that's mediated by something called oxytocin.
###401 And that is what sustains love.
###405 KARLEY SCIORTINO: Gosh, I feel like I've
###407 learned so much today.
###408 But more than anything, what all of this made me realize is
###411 that unfortunately, there's no formula we can follow to find
###415 our soul mates.
###417 We are all equally lost within this labyrinth of love.
###420 And realistically, dating and sex are meant to
###422 be clumsy and awkward.
###424 But it's good to create an open dialogue about this stuff
###427 in order to make our sexuality a little bit less terrifying.
###431 And if you remember to read lots of books, take your
###433 vitamins, and not be a total bore, one day you will find
###437 that special person who will love you for you, who will
###440 give you semi-regular orgasms and ask nicely before he puts
###443 it in your butt.
###445 You know, Slutever.
###446
