414
0:22:12,73 --> 0:22:15,14
After long days of traveling
through Libya, we were 20


415
0:22:15,14 --> 0:22:19,98
kilometers outside of Misrata,
and closing in on the front.


416
0:22:19,98 --> 0:22:22,335
Our driver handed us off to
other rebels, who could take


417
0:22:22,335 --> 0:22:23,585
us the rest of the way.


418
0:22:23,585 --> 0:22:38,33



419
0:22:38,33 --> 0:22:40,71
When we finally got to the
front, they were really


420
0:22:40,71 --> 0:22:43,41
nervous about our camera giving
away their location.


421
0:22:43,41 --> 0:22:44,733
And we had to limit our shots.


422
0:22:44,733 --> 0:22:57,89



423
0:22:57,89 --> 0:23:0,53
They were obviously digging in,
and preparing an attack


424
0:23:0,53 --> 0:23:3,46
that they told us they were
expecting within the next 12


425
0:23:3,46 --> 0:23:17,74
to 24 hours.


426
0:23:17,74 --> 0:23:20,32
In fact, while we were there,
they got word that a major


427
0:23:20,32 --> 0:23:21,9
offensive was about to start.


428
0:23:21,9 --> 0:23:24,32
So they advised to leave Misrata
as soon as we possibly


429
0:23:24,32 --> 0:23:26,1
could, because they thought
the offensive


430
0:23:26,1 --> 0:23:27,568
was going to be huge.

0:23:44,23 --> 0:23:46,17
We took the last ship in.


435
0:23:46,17 --> 0:23:49,63
So we're going to take
this fishing boat.


436
0:23:49,63 --> 0:23:52,33
Aside from ourselves, the
captain had also taken on a


437
0:23:52,33 --> 0:23:55,63
few rebels who were heading
back Benghazi They saw our


438
0:23:55,63 --> 0:23:57,96
cameras and offered to show
us some pics of their own.

0:23:57,96 --> 0:24:5,26



440
0:24:5,26 --> 0:24:7,68
The boat back to Benghazi
only motored about seven

kilometers an hour.


442
0:24:8,73 --> 0:24:11,9

of time to think about

what I had just seen.


444
0:24:12,75 --> 0:24:15,17
I had witnessed something in
Libya that is usually only

responded the same way.
