1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:21,328



2
0:0:21,328 --> 0:0:24,304
-Did you have the nickname
Eric Pu-puppy?


3
0:0:24,304 --> 0:0:25,296
ERIC PUPECKI: No.


4
0:0:25,296 --> 0:0:26,288
-That's some genius.


5
0:0:26,288 --> 0:0:27,28
ERIC PUPECKI: Oh yeah, baby.


6
0:0:27,28 --> 0:0:28,768
Gotta figure out the
little space.


7
0:0:28,768 --> 0:0:31,29



8
0:0:31,29 --> 0:0:32,54
Right guys?


9
0:0:32,54 --> 0:0:35,22



10
0:0:35,22 --> 0:0:36,82
Yeah, my daughter should
be along soon.


11
0:0:36,82 --> 0:0:40,664
That's her, over there in the
photo, in the yellow one.


12
0:0:40,664 --> 0:0:43,1
-Did you grow up
close to here?


13
0:0:43,1 --> 0:0:43,98
ERIC PUPECKI: Yeah,
close to here.


14
0:0:43,98 --> 0:0:46,65
We didn't grow up in
this house though.


15
0:0:46,65 --> 0:0:48,549
This was my mom's house,
and her husband.


16
0:0:48,549 --> 0:0:52,68



17
0:0:52,68 --> 0:0:55,51
You know, these are
all the hits.


18
0:0:55,51 --> 0:0:57,69
But we bring out the computer
now, so there's no more--


19
0:0:57,69 --> 0:1:0,22
I got this new night that I
bring a little vinyl out.


20
0:1:0,22 --> 0:1:4,73
But we just go out with big
boxes like this of vinyl.


21
0:1:4,73 --> 0:1:5,95
I used to, anyway.


22
0:1:5,95 --> 0:1:8,2
-How did you get into it?


23
0:1:8,2 --> 0:1:10,7
ERIC PUPECKI: Just the local
people around here, skaters.


24
0:1:10,7 --> 0:1:14,55
And it was just the great
music, you know.


25
0:1:14,55 --> 0:1:17,68
These are some of my LPs.


26
0:1:17,68 --> 0:1:19,61
I don't get to them as
much as I used to.


27
0:1:19,61 --> 0:1:22,21
I do plumbing work, and that's
what I make my money with.


28
0:1:22,21 --> 0:1:24,87
When I used to be a pro skater,
I'd sit in my room and


29
0:1:24,87 --> 0:1:27,83
oh, listen to album after
album and hang around.


30
0:1:27,83 --> 0:1:31,9
-What year did you
start skating?


31
0:1:31,9 --> 0:1:32,12
ERIC PUPECKI: I don't know,
when I was like


32
0:1:32,12 --> 0:1:35,67
15, so 23 years ago.


33
0:1:35,67 --> 0:1:39,28
I got a late start, per
se, 15, 16 years old.


34
0:1:39,28 --> 0:1:42,2
-But were you always
involved in sports?


35
0:1:42,2 --> 0:1:45,74
ERIC PUPECKI: Yeah, I played
baseball and I did BMX.


36
0:1:45,74 --> 0:1:48,8
The skateboard took
the BMX bike away.


37
0:1:48,8 --> 0:1:52,66
A lot of little contests
in Rhode Island--


38
0:1:52,66 --> 0:1:55,92
second place, sponsored, 1990.


39
0:1:55,92 --> 0:1:57,27
-Who were you sponsored
by then?


40
0:1:57,27 --> 0:1:58,9
ERIC PUPECKI: It was just
probably a local shop--


41
0:1:58,9 --> 0:2:0,31
the Watershed.


42
0:2:0,31 --> 0:2:2,9
-And how did you end up
getting out there?


43
0:2:2,9 --> 0:2:6,47
ERIC PUPECKI: I just took the
bus to San Francisco.


44
0:2:6,47 --> 0:2:8,94
I got on the bus with a
couple friends, and I


45
0:2:8,94 --> 0:2:9,68
just went for it.


46
0:2:9,68 --> 0:2:10,639
It was quick, too.


47
0:2:10,639 --> 0:2:13,9
I was out there a month, and
I was already sponsored and


48
0:2:13,9 --> 0:2:15,7
ready to rock.


49
0:2:15,7 --> 0:2:17,4
I just showed up at EMB
and skated with


50
0:2:17,4 --> 0:2:18,47
everyone that was there.


51
0:2:18,47 --> 0:2:21,35
Jim Thiebaud was the first
hook up, and James Kelch.


52
0:2:21,35 --> 0:2:23,77
Those guys liked me, so they
would just give me stuff.


53
0:2:23,77 --> 0:2:27,4
My first photo was on Market
Street doing the Thunder ad,


54
0:2:27,4 --> 0:2:28,79
doing that ollie over
that fountain there.


55
0:2:28,79 --> 0:2:30,2
I was going big, pretty much.


56
0:2:30,2 --> 0:2:31,78
GINO IANNUCCI: He was out in San
Francisco when I went to


57
0:2:31,78 --> 0:2:34,45
visit with Keenan and Huf.


58
0:2:34,45 --> 0:2:36,36
They were staying
at Ron's house.


59
0:2:36,36 --> 0:2:39,44
And I think Eric was down
with Fun, back then.


60
0:2:39,44 --> 0:2:42,64
I think that one trip, that's
when I met Eric.


61
0:2:42,64 --> 0:2:44,36
He was just a good skater.


62
0:2:44,36 --> 0:2:46,58
-Who did you become friends
with that was on Fun?


63
0:2:46,58 --> 0:2:49,38
ERIC PUPECKI: It was me,
Keenan, and Huf.


64
0:2:49,38 --> 0:2:51,28
And that was the main three
dudes that would roll.


65
0:2:51,28 --> 0:2:55,12
It would be Ron, Keenan, Huf,
and me in the car, going


66
0:2:55,12 --> 0:2:57,45
around the tour fighting,
having fun.


67
0:2:57,45 --> 0:2:59,71
But there was no money.


68
0:2:59,71 --> 0:3:3,25
So we're all just piled
in a car, expected to


69
0:3:3,25 --> 0:3:5,16
do stuff for nothing.


70
0:3:5,16 --> 0:3:7,742
But we were having fun,
so it didn't matter.


71
0:3:7,742 --> 0:3:9,27
-What were some of your
favorite things


72
0:3:9,27 --> 0:3:11,45
that you got on video?


73
0:3:11,45 --> 0:3:14,6
ERIC PUPECKI: It's the things
that I didn't get is some of


74
0:3:14,6 --> 0:3:17,44
the things that would
be my favorite.


75
0:3:17,44 --> 0:3:19,3
The kickflip the Gonz had
done had to be one


76
0:3:19,3 --> 0:3:21,44
of the great feelings--


77
0:3:21,44 --> 0:3:23,372
at the time, too.


78
0:3:23,372 --> 0:3:26,9
It was like two weeks after
Gonz had done it.


79
0:3:26,9 --> 0:3:30,45
And the time I had the broke the
board sequence was before


80
0:3:30,45 --> 0:3:31,41
Gonz had done it.


81
0:3:31,41 --> 0:3:33,64
So then Gonz was just hanging
out one day and is like, oh,


82
0:3:33,64 --> 0:3:35,5
maybe I should just
kickflip it.


83
0:3:35,5 --> 0:3:37,3
And he just goes and does it.


84
0:3:37,3 --> 0:3:39,41
And I was there, and
I was like, fuck.


85
0:3:39,41 --> 0:3:41,18
And a couple weeks later I was
skating it with somebody, and


86
0:3:41,18 --> 0:3:42,76
I just did it.


87
0:3:42,76 --> 0:3:44,8
But it felt really good.


88
0:3:44,8 --> 0:3:46,42
But I was like, fuck, three
weeks ago, I could


89
0:3:46,42 --> 0:3:49,3
have been the first.


90
0:3:49,3 --> 0:3:50,53
-That 411 opener?


91
0:3:50,53 --> 0:3:53,63
ERIC PUPECKI: Yeah, the open the
hardflip down the seven.


92
0:3:53,63 --> 0:3:54,85
Yeah, that felt real good too.


93
0:3:54,85 --> 0:3:57,7
I was happy with that because
I was down and out.


94
0:3:57,7 --> 0:3:58,58
And I didn't have a sponsor
right then either.


95
0:3:58,58 --> 0:4:1,55
I was just filming with Aaron,
doing the thing.


96
0:4:1,55 --> 0:4:4,1
Mike Ternasky, at the time, he
was trying to set me up.


97
0:4:4,1 --> 0:4:6,7
If I landed a couple good
tricks, he'd throw me some


98
0:4:6,7 --> 0:4:8,93
money, give me the boards
I'd need, keep going.


99
0:4:8,93 --> 0:4:10,35
Because he knew I didn't
have a sponsor.


100
0:4:10,35 --> 0:4:12,17
I was kind of out there.


101
0:4:12,17 --> 0:4:14,6
Because I was talking to Mike
Ternasky at the time, he was


102
0:4:14,6 --> 0:4:18,37
trying to set me up for
Plan B and all that.


103
0:4:18,37 --> 0:4:20,29
Menace came along right
around the same time,


104
0:4:20,29 --> 0:4:22,99
so I went for that.


105
0:4:22,99 --> 0:4:25,225
I remember he came up to me in
Vancouver and said, yo, you


106
0:4:25,225 --> 0:4:28,92
didn't even tell me you were
gonna jump on Menace.


107
0:4:28,92 --> 0:4:30,6
I wish you would
have told me--


108
0:4:30,6 --> 0:4:31,58
just kind of breaking me up.


109
0:4:31,58 --> 0:4:34,11
He was happy for me,
but he was just


110
0:4:34,11 --> 0:4:35,84
kind of saying whatever.


111
0:4:35,84 --> 0:4:36,71
Just giving me shit.


112
0:4:36,71 --> 0:4:38,86
-Were you filming a lot
with Socrates then?


113
0:4:38,86 --> 0:4:42,45
ERIC PUPECKI: Oh yeah, that
was like every day--


114
0:4:42,45 --> 0:4:45,685
go eat with Soc, go film
with Soc, hang out with


115
0:4:45,685 --> 0:4:46,98
Soc, yell at Soc.


116
0:4:46,98 --> 0:4:47,61
It was a good time.


117
0:4:47,61 --> 0:4:48,7
He was great.


118
0:4:48,7 --> 0:4:50,38
He was the nicest person--
drive you


119
0:4:50,38 --> 0:4:52,3
anywhere, do anything.


120
0:4:52,3 --> 0:4:53,83
SOCRATES LEAL: Pupecki was
always down to skate, but it


121
0:4:53,83 --> 0:4:55,825
seemed like he wasn't down to
skate the stuff that the other


122
0:4:55,825 --> 0:4:57,73
dudes were skating.


123
0:4:57,73 --> 0:5:0,81
He had a different bag of
tricks, definitely.


124
0:5:0,81 --> 0:5:3,85
He was kind of an innovator,
it seemed to me.


125
0:5:3,85 --> 0:5:6,9
I don't think he was like one
of those dudes that was


126
0:5:6,9 --> 0:5:8,65
busting flip and flip
out type stuff.


127
0:5:8,65 --> 0:5:12,2
He was just the kind of dude
that go for a back tail on a


128
0:5:12,2 --> 0:5:16,145
big rail, or front crooking
the Venice ledge.


129
0:5:16,145 --> 0:5:18,2
-What about the Lockwood
sessions?


130
0:5:18,2 --> 0:5:18,98
ERIC PUPECKI: Everyone's
watching


131
0:5:18,98 --> 0:5:20,19
when you're out there.


132
0:5:20,19 --> 0:5:22,46
In Rhode Island, you're on a
dead street with nobody, like


133
0:5:22,46 --> 0:5:22,88
you're there.


134
0:5:22,88 --> 0:5:26,7
In Lockwood, it's the
center stage--


135
0:5:26,7 --> 0:5:28,88
everyone's filming,
people ripping.


136
0:5:28,88 --> 0:5:31,78
This is a time when all these
tricks are being done on the


137
0:5:31,78 --> 0:5:35,16
big benches for the
first time.


138
0:5:35,16 --> 0:5:38,26
Even like a switch nosegrind on
a top of a picnic table--


139
0:5:38,26 --> 0:5:40,59
no one had done it.


140
0:5:40,59 --> 0:5:43,12
I did the frontside blunt--
no one had done it.


141
0:5:43,12 --> 0:5:46,4
Every day it's a new trick,
first time ever done.


142
0:5:46,4 --> 0:5:48,18
It was exciting--


143
0:5:48,18 --> 0:5:50,12
just go home and talk
about the stuff.


144
0:5:50,12 --> 0:5:52,506
It was cool.


145
0:5:52,506 --> 0:5:55,1
-Did the team fit with your
vibe at the time?


146
0:5:55,1 --> 0:5:56,21
ERIC PUPECKI: Yeah.


147
0:5:56,21 --> 0:5:58,1
We all got along right away.


148
0:5:58,1 --> 0:6:0,81
Everyone's smoking, everyone's
drinking, skating.


149
0:6:0,81 --> 0:6:3,49
Just doing that all the time.


150
0:6:3,49 --> 0:6:4,59
It was just a good time.


151
0:6:4,59 --> 0:6:7,7
We got to move around a lot
together and just be able to


152
0:6:7,7 --> 0:6:11,222
act as crazy as we
wanted to be.


153
0:6:11,222 --> 0:6:13,18
And get treated with respect
everywhere we went.


154
0:6:13,18 --> 0:6:15,28
And it was good.


155
0:6:15,28 --> 0:6:16,31
You can't beat that.


156
0:6:16,31 --> 0:6:18,56
-Were there any other people
that you guys wanted to be on


157
0:6:18,56 --> 0:6:19,652
the team that never got on?


158
0:6:19,652 --> 0:6:20,3
ERIC PUPECKI: Nah.


159
0:6:20,3 --> 0:6:21,2
We had a team.


160
0:6:21,2 --> 0:6:26,44
It was almost like, who are
we going to let into this?


161
0:6:26,44 --> 0:6:26,97
Nobody.


162
0:6:26,97 --> 0:6:27,54
Forget it.


163
0:6:27,54 --> 0:6:28,98
You know what I mean?


164
0:6:28,98 --> 0:6:31,44
Even Stevie Williams was
dying to get on.


165
0:6:31,44 --> 0:6:33,35
We'd be sitting there drinking
Hennessy in Philly.


166
0:6:33,35 --> 0:6:35,85
He'd be doing flat ground in
front of us all night.


167
0:6:35,85 --> 0:6:39,67
Just trying to show us how high
he could pop his shit.


168
0:6:39,67 --> 0:6:41,843
And look at Stevie now, he's
fucking killing it.


169
0:6:41,843 --> 0:6:43,52
STEVIE WILLIAMS: Yeah,
I was a fan.


170
0:6:43,52 --> 0:6:46,2
I've always been a fan
of Kareem and Menace.


171
0:6:46,2 --> 0:6:49,37
And I always wanted to
be on that team.


172
0:6:49,37 --> 0:6:51,6
That's the team that
I wanted to be on.


173
0:6:51,6 --> 0:6:53,105
And it never happened.


174
0:6:53,105 --> 0:6:55,8
It's like buying a car,
you know what I mean?


175
0:6:55,8 --> 0:6:58,55
I want the Lexus, but I had to
settle for the goddamn Accord.


176
0:6:58,55 --> 0:6:59,55
You know what I mean?


177
0:6:59,55 --> 0:7:0,9
It sucked.


178
0:7:0,9 --> 0:7:4,51
But at least I got a chance to
ride in a Lexus, you feel me?


179
0:7:4,51 --> 0:7:7,34
I was happy just knowing
them dudes.


180
0:7:7,34 --> 0:7:9,28
It felt like, when I'm around
them, I'm actually


181
0:7:9,28 --> 0:7:10,88
a part of the team.


182
0:7:10,88 --> 0:7:13,795
But I didn't get the product
or go on a tour.


183
0:7:13,795 --> 0:7:15,1
ERIC PUPECKI: But then
it got goofy.


184
0:7:15,1 --> 0:7:18,75
And then people like
Caine Gayle got on.


185
0:7:18,75 --> 0:7:20,402
It just kind of took
the integrity right


186
0:7:20,402 --> 0:7:22,82
out of it, I think.


187
0:7:22,82 --> 0:7:25,0
I wasn't down for that.


188
0:7:25,0 --> 0:7:26,88
And that's when I got grumpy.


189
0:7:26,88 --> 0:7:29,46
I was kind of distancing
myself from


190
0:7:29,46 --> 0:7:31,437
everybody by being so grumpy.


191
0:7:31,437 --> 0:7:32,87
-You stayed on until
the end, right?


192
0:7:32,87 --> 0:7:33,15
ERIC PUPECKI: Yeah, of course.


193
0:7:33,15 --> 0:7:36,31
But like I said, all that
footage was mad old.


194
0:7:36,31 --> 0:7:38,53
They didn't want to use my
footage because it was so old.


195
0:7:38,53 --> 0:7:42,77
I wasn't taking control, so
I can't blame anybody.


196
0:7:42,77 --> 0:7:44,59
I don't regret none of that.


197
0:7:44,59 --> 0:7:47,44
Even though, like you said, I
look back and I'm like, I


198
0:7:47,44 --> 0:7:50,3
should have done this, should
have done that, but whatever,


199
0:7:50,3 --> 0:7:51,152
just keep going.


200
0:7:51,152 --> 0:7:53,492
-Does your daughter ever ask
about your skate career?


201
0:7:53,492 --> 0:7:54,97
ERIC PUPECKI: Not too much.


202
0:7:54,97 --> 0:7:57,54
I don't talk about it.


203
0:7:57,54 --> 0:8:1,76
I just live in the present
a lot of the times.


204
0:8:1,76 --> 0:8:5,12
I go through phases, like, I
used to do that, but then get


205
0:8:5,12 --> 0:8:6,23
back to reality.


206
0:8:6,23 --> 0:8:8,78
-Has she ever seen "20 Shot
Sequence" or anything?


207
0:8:8,78 --> 0:8:10,86
ERIC PUPECKI: She likes it all
right, but she likes "iCarly,"


208
0:8:10,86 --> 0:8:15,904
she likes "Victorious,"
some shit like that.


209
0:8:15,904 --> 0:8:18,155
COREY GRAYHORSE: Good
fall, though.


210
0:8:18,155 --> 0:8:21,42
Did you get our bunny?


211
0:8:21,42 --> 0:8:25,75
Uh oh, don't scratch it.


212
0:8:25,75 --> 0:8:26,71
-What's your bunny's name?


213
0:8:26,71 --> 0:8:28,3
CAILEE LOLA: Cupcake.


214
0:8:28,3 --> 0:8:29,89
This is my favorite.


215
0:8:29,89 --> 0:8:31,45
This one.


216
0:8:31,45 --> 0:8:32,2
It's a dolphin.


217
0:8:32,2 --> 0:8:32,75
-Oh yeah?


218
0:8:32,75 --> 0:8:33,536
CAILEE LOLA: Yeah.


219
0:8:33,536 --> 0:8:36,95
And this one's pretty funny.


220
0:8:36,95 --> 0:8:40,65
COREY GRAYHORSE: I met Eric
in Long Beach, at ASR.


221
0:8:40,65 --> 0:8:44,76
You know, whatever, fun times
lead to crazy weekend.


222
0:8:44,76 --> 0:8:47,573
I remember that Guru was
performing that weekend.


223
0:8:47,573 --> 0:8:50,705
I remember Eric got arrested
that weekend.


224
0:8:50,705 --> 0:8:52,414
Oh, I forgot she was here.


225
0:8:52,414 --> 0:8:55,15
CAILEE LOLA: You got arrested?


226
0:8:55,15 --> 0:8:56,642
-[INAUDIBLE].


227
0:8:56,642 --> 0:8:57,534
COREY GRAYHORSE: Yeah.


228
0:8:57,534 --> 0:8:59,965
Yeah, he got arrested and
Keenan bailed him out.


229
0:8:59,965 --> 0:9:0,3
CAILEE LOLA: For what?


230
0:9:0,3 --> 0:9:2,275
ERIC PUPECKI: Nothing.


231
0:9:2,275 --> 0:9:4,126
COREY GRAYHORSE: For
being too silly.


232
0:9:4,126 --> 0:9:4,602
CAILEE LOLA: Oh.


233
0:9:4,602 --> 0:9:5,78
COREY GRAYHORSE:
And that's why.


234
0:9:5,78 --> 0:9:7,985
ERIC PUPECKI: Way too silly.


235
0:9:7,985 --> 0:9:9,914
COREY GRAYHORSE: He wasn't
being a good boy.


236
0:9:9,914 --> 0:9:11,862
They were crazy.


237
0:9:11,862 --> 0:9:13,54
-It was just sort of like,
who's that guy in the


238
0:9:13,54 --> 0:9:15,69
beginning of the "20
Shot Sequence"?


239
0:9:15,69 --> 0:9:16,33
ERIC PUPECKI: Matt Naylor.


240
0:9:16,33 --> 0:9:17,34
He was a good guy.


241
0:9:17,34 --> 0:9:20,59
That was Billy's
right-hand man.


242
0:9:20,59 --> 0:9:22,75
One time we were all just
buzzed in Hollywood.


243
0:9:22,75 --> 0:9:25,55
And he had an old BMW 320--


244
0:9:25,55 --> 0:9:27,115
his dad's car.


245
0:9:27,115 --> 0:9:28,6
I was like, yo, take
me to McDonald's.


246
0:9:28,6 --> 0:9:29,7
And he fucking took
me to McDonald's.


247
0:9:29,7 --> 0:9:31,21
I jump out, I slam the
door, the whole


248
0:9:31,21 --> 0:9:33,54
fucking window smashes.


249
0:9:33,54 --> 0:9:37,15
So he gets out, and he's like,
dude, what the fuck?


250
0:9:37,15 --> 0:9:38,75
I go like this, I flinch him
and then I hit him in the


251
0:9:38,75 --> 0:9:40,63
shoulder two times after
I break his window.


252
0:9:40,63 --> 0:9:42,89
I mean, shit was crazy.


253
0:9:42,89 --> 0:9:43,52
You know what I mean?


254
0:9:43,52 --> 0:9:46,19
I slammed his door, broke his
window, then I punched him in


255
0:9:46,19 --> 0:9:48,21
his arm two times.


256
0:9:48,21 --> 0:9:49,68
Not nice.


257
0:9:49,68 --> 0:9:50,93
That's fucked up.


258
0:9:50,93 --> 0:11:50,93
