0:0:5,2 --> 0:0:9,5
Africa is a battle field for wildlife


3
0:0:9,5 --> 0:0:13,0
a place where ancient giants‥


4
0:0:13,0 --> 0:0:16,4
stealthy hunters‥


5
0:0:16,4 --> 0:0:18,7
and unparalleled predators


6
0:0:18,7 --> 0:0:26,1
engage in a never-ending
struggle for survival


7
0:0:26,1 --> 0:0:32,7
But among these species
12 rule supreme


8
0:0:32,7 --> 0:0:35,4
These predators are swift‥


9
0:0:35,4 --> 0:0:38,2
powerful‥


10
0:0:38,2 --> 0:0:42,2
and often lethal


11
0:0:42,2 --> 0:1:0,5
Prepare to come face to face
with Africa's Deadly Dozen


12
0:1:0,5 --> 0:1:2,1
In many people's minds


13
0:1:2,1 --> 0:1:8,6
this is the last truly wild continent


14
0:1:8,6 --> 0:1:10,9
Its 30 million square kilometres


15
0:1:10,9 --> 0:1:17,1
contain some of the world's
most extreme landscapes‥


16
0:1:17,1 --> 0:1:18,6
‥the Serengeti


17
0:1:18,6 --> 0:1:24,6
a vast arena for the delicate ballet
of life and death‥


18
0:1:24,6 --> 0:1:26,1
‥the Okavango


19
0:1:26,1 --> 0:1:31,5
an oasis emerging from
the parched Kalahari Desert‥


20
0:1:31,5 --> 0:1:33,3
‥and the Great Rift Valley


21
0:1:33,3 --> 0:1:40,5
an unforgiving terrain and
the scorching 'cradle of man'


22
0:1:40,5 --> 0:1:45,3
These brutal cauldrons forge creatures
of incomparable strength and power‥


23
0:1:45,3 --> 0:1:54,5
creatures found nowhere else on Earth


24
0:1:54,5 --> 0:1:57,7
Most of Africa's wildlife
and its people


25
0:1:57,7 --> 0:2:1,0
live south of the searing Sahara Desert


26
0:2:1,0 --> 0:2:4,9
And in this region
one predator in particular reigns


27
0:2:4,9 --> 0:2:15,2
the snake


28
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:19,4
Africa plays host to the greatest
diversity of snakes in the world


29
0:2:19,4 --> 0:2:21,1
400 in total


30
0:2:21,1 --> 0:2:24,8
with over 90 of them venomous


31
0:2:24,8 --> 0:2:37,5
And these toxic serpents
are built for the kill


32
0:2:37,5 --> 0:2:46,5
Each is uniquely specialized
to capture its prey


33
0:2:46,5 --> 0:2:48,6
Sleek cobras stalk‥


34
0:2:48,6 --> 0:2:51,3
while muscular vipers lie in wait‥


35
0:2:51,3 --> 0:2:54,5
and still others take to the trees


36
0:2:54,5 --> 0:2:55,8
But if threatened


37
0:2:55,8 --> 0:3:7,2
all of these predators
will lash out with a hiss of death


38
0:3:7,2 --> 0:3:8,1
And among them


39
0:3:8,1 --> 0:3:11,1
this is the quintessential
deadly serpent‥


40
0:3:11,1 --> 0:3:16,6
embodying all that's lethal
without even baring it fangs


41
0:3:16,6 --> 0:3:20,3
It's known as Naja Nivea
the cape cobra


42
0:3:20,3 --> 0:3:22,6
and anyone who corners this snake


43
0:3:22,6 --> 0:3:32,2
is likely to pay with their life


44
0:3:32,2 --> 0:3:34,0
The one and a half metre cobra


45
0:3:34,0 --> 0:3:41,3
is neither the biggest nor the
widest-ranging venomous serpent in Africa


46
0:3:41,3 --> 0:3:44,6
It's only found in one region
the southwest


47
0:3:44,6 --> 0:3:49,3
but this includes the heavily-populated
country of South Africa


48
0:3:49,3 --> 0:3:52,7
And it often appears
in prime ranching territory


49
0:3:52,7 --> 0:4:2,2
so human encounters are all too common


50
0:4:2,2 --> 0:4:5,8
Every year, the cape cobra kills
more people in South Africa


51
0:4:5,8 --> 0:4:7,7
than any other snake


52
0:4:7,7 --> 0:4:13,6
Its speckled skin enables it
to almost disappear within the landscape


53
0:4:13,6 --> 0:4:21,2
until it's stumbled upon
by an unlucky rancher or shepherd


54
0:4:21,2 --> 0:4:24,3
When trapped
it raises the front of its body high


55
0:4:24,3 --> 0:4:31,1
and spreads its trademark hood
in a display of intimidation‥


56
0:4:31,1 --> 0:4:36,6
then it strikes


57
0:4:36,6 --> 0:4:40,1
The rush of venom immediately
attacks the body's nervous system


58
0:4:40,1 --> 0:4:41,9
It paralyzes the muscles


59
0:4:41,9 --> 0:4:44,5
and triggers coronary
and respiratory failure


60
0:4:44,5 --> 0:4:56,0
Just one bite can kill up to six people


61
0:4:56,0 --> 0:5:3,3
And the cobra doesn't just strike once


62
0:5:3,3 --> 0:5:7,0
It continues to strike
until the threat has moved away


63
0:5:7,0 --> 0:5:10,6
flooding its victim with toxins


64
0:5:10,6 --> 0:5:14,0
Another venomous snake
also lurks among the branches


65
0:5:14,0 --> 0:5:20,5
and this one is practically invisible


66
0:5:20,5 --> 0:5:28,7
It's the eastern green mamba
Africa's emerald giant


67
0:5:28,7 --> 0:5:32,8
Resting in the canopy
it's easily missed


68
0:5:32,8 --> 0:5:34,4
But when it's on the move


69
0:5:34,4 --> 0:5:40,9
it's clear
what makes this serpent so deadly


70
0:5:40,9 --> 0:5:48,2
The green mamba stretches
up to two metres long


71
0:5:48,2 --> 0:5:50,5
Its slender contours and camouflage


72
0:5:50,5 --> 0:5:53,2
mean it's perfectly suited
to a life in the trees


73
0:5:53,2 --> 0:5:54,9
where it sleeps‥


74
0:5:54,9 --> 0:6:4,1
mates‥ and feeds


75
0:6:4,1 --> 0:6:6,5
The green mamba hunts a sinuous band


76
0:6:6,5 --> 0:6:9,3
from coastal Kenya south to Zimbabwe


77
0:6:9,3 --> 0:6:14,5
where it lurks in scrub bush and forests


78
0:6:14,5 --> 0:6:25,8
It's nearly invisible to the birds
rodents and small lizards it pursues


79
0:6:25,8 --> 0:6:28,4
Its ever-vigilant eyes never close


80
0:6:28,4 --> 0:6:37,0
because fixed transparent shields
serve in place of eyelids


81
0:6:37,0 --> 0:6:42,4
Its attention is drawn by movement


82
0:6:42,4 --> 0:7:4,0
One misplaced hand
and the mamba springs to life


83
0:7:4,0 --> 0:7:7,2
Victims of its bite feel a burning pain


84
0:7:7,2 --> 0:7:10,0
As the venom spreads it eats away tissue


85
0:7:10,0 --> 0:7:11,8
potentially causing gangrene


86
0:7:11,8 --> 0:7:18,2
and leaving behind a permanent scar


87
0:7:18,2 --> 0:7:22,7
Fortunately green mambas often
choose escape over confrontation


88
0:7:22,7 --> 0:7:30,1
and only a handful of deaths
have ever been recorded


89
0:7:30,1 --> 0:7:32,8
But another mamba also lives up here


90
0:7:32,8 --> 0:7:36,8
less shy than its green cousin‥


91
0:7:36,8 --> 0:7:44,9
and this one is lethal


92
0:7:44,9 --> 0:7:54,4
It's the black mamba


93
0:7:54,4 --> 0:7:57,7
The black mamba follows
a trail of aerial clues‥


94
0:7:57,7 --> 0:8:10,8
tasting the air as it goes


95
0:8:10,8 --> 0:8:24,1
Its target is an abandoned hatchling


96
0:8:24,1 --> 0:8:26,8
Potent venom floods
the tiny bird's system


97
0:8:26,8 --> 0:8:35,7
killing it swiftly


98
0:8:35,7 --> 0:8:40,3
This mamba is a far more
dangerous snake than the green


99
0:8:40,3 --> 0:8:43,7
Not only is it found across a much
larger swath of the continent


100
0:8:43,7 --> 0:8:45,8
from Ethiopia to Namibia


101
0:8:45,8 --> 0:8:51,9
but it also hunts on the ground


102
0:8:51,9 --> 0:9:3,0
And that places it
in direct contact with humans


103
0:9:3,0 --> 0:9:5,7
It only takes one encounter
with a black mamba


104
0:9:5,7 --> 0:9:10,5
to realize what makes this snake
so terrifying


105
0:9:10,5 --> 0:9:12,8
Not only is it extraordinarily toxic


106
0:9:12,8 --> 0:9:22,7
it's the longest
and fastest snake in Africa


107
0:9:22,7 --> 0:9:26,4
A black mamba can reach burst speeds
of five metres per second


108
0:9:26,4 --> 0:9:37,7
faster than most people can run


109
0:9:37,7 --> 0:9:43,4
Incredibly, the mamba can also lift
half of its 3.5m body off the ground


110
0:9:43,4 --> 0:9:57,4
and return to the trees


111
0:9:57,4 --> 0:9:59,1
Every harvest season


112
0:9:59,1 --> 0:10:4,4
orchard workers venture into
the realm of the black mamba


113
0:10:4,4 --> 0:10:7,7
Surrounded, the snake
will first try to escape


114
0:10:7,7 --> 0:10:18,6
But if it has nowhere to go‥
it will defend itself


115
0:10:18,6 --> 0:10:24,0
Flashing its ebony-coloured mouth
it strikes


116
0:10:24,0 --> 0:10:28,0
The victim is infused with a complex
torrent of paralyzing toxins


117
0:10:28,0 --> 0:10:31,6
This venom attacks the body's muscles
and heart and lung function


118
0:10:31,6 --> 0:10:39,3
And when the muscles stop
asphyxiation sets in


119
0:10:39,3 --> 0:10:56,5
Death can occur in as few as 20 minutes


120
0:10:56,5 --> 0:10:58,0
Before anti-venom


121
0:10:58,0 --> 0:11:3,7
the black mamba's bite
was almost 100 per cent fatal


122
0:11:3,7 --> 0:11:6,8
But today
hospitals can save most victims


123
0:11:6,8 --> 0:11:12,1
if they can get there in time


124
0:11:12,1 --> 0:11:15,3
But while the black mamba
may be Africa's most feared snake


125
0:11:15,3 --> 0:11:20,6
it's not the deadliest


126
0:11:20,6 --> 0:11:24,2
That distinction goes
to the master of concealment‥


127
0:11:24,2 --> 0:11:30,3
the puff adder


128
0:11:30,3 --> 0:11:38,4
It kills more people in Africa
than any other snake


129
0:11:38,4 --> 0:11:41,7
It earns this dubious distinction
because of its huge range


130
0:11:41,7 --> 0:11:43,8
which covers nearly half the continent


131
0:11:43,8 --> 0:11:51,4
from tropical Senegal
to Eritrea and South Africa


132
0:11:51,4 --> 0:11:53,8
Most encounters are accidental


133
0:11:53,8 --> 0:12:5,5
because victims often
don't see the well-hidden adder


134
0:12:5,5 --> 0:12:19,4
Slow and muscular
it can't use speed to escape


135
0:12:19,4 --> 0:12:22,5
So instead, it relies
on its method of attack


136
0:12:22,5 --> 0:12:26,0
This heavy snake launches
its one metre body into the air


137
0:12:26,0 --> 0:12:36,3
and towards any unwise intruder


138
0:12:36,3 --> 0:12:39,2
Centimetre long hollow fangs
inject a venom


139
0:12:39,2 --> 0:12:46,9
that starts to destroy blood cells
and tissue almost immediately


140
0:12:46,9 --> 0:12:49,6
Most people do survive the encounter


141
0:12:49,6 --> 0:12:50,9
But the adder's range


142
0:12:50,9 --> 0:12:53,2
and the sheer number of bites it inflicts


143
0:12:53,2 --> 0:12:56,4
reap a deadly toll
that results in more fatalities


144
0:12:56,4 --> 0:13:1,2
than any other African snake


145
0:13:1,2 --> 0:13:12,6
But people aren't the only casualties


146
0:13:12,6 --> 0:13:16,0
Undetected, this adder remains frozen


147
0:13:16,0 --> 0:13:18,7
Although its victim
is only centimetres away


148
0:13:18,7 --> 0:13:26,1
it has no idea of its impending death


149
0:13:26,1 --> 0:13:28,0
The adder attacks when the target


150
0:13:28,0 --> 0:13:51,8
is unable to use teeth and claws
in self defence


151
0:13:51,8 --> 0:14:2,3
Its lower jaw widens
to accommodate larger prey


152
0:14:2,3 --> 0:14:4,3
When the meal is finally devoured


153
0:14:4,3 --> 0:14:10,7
its jaw flexes back to normal


154
0:14:10,7 --> 0:14:14,3
Africa's snakes inhabit almost
every corner of the continent


155
0:14:14,3 --> 0:14:17,6
brilliantly adapted for life
both on the ground


156
0:14:17,6 --> 0:14:33,5
and high above


157
0:14:33,5 --> 0:14:36,3
In the Savannas of eastern
and southern Africa


158
0:14:36,3 --> 0:14:43,7
water is the most precious commodity


159
0:14:43,7 --> 0:14:45,3
And within these pools


160
0:14:45,3 --> 0:14:48,2
live two of Africa's most lethal animals


161
0:14:48,2 --> 0:15:28,6
both armed to the teeth


162
0:15:28,6 --> 0:15:32,6
Every year, Nile crocodiles
kill hundreds of people


163
0:15:32,6 --> 0:15:45,8
probably more than all other species
of crocodile combined


164
0:15:45,8 --> 0:15:52,4
They hunt waterways
throughout most of Africa


165
0:15:52,4 --> 0:15:53,7
Yet people have driven them


166
0:15:53,7 --> 0:16:2,8
from much of the river
that shares their name


167
0:16:2,8 --> 0:16:5,2
A reptile of epic proportions


168
0:16:5,2 --> 0:16:7,9
the Nile crocodile can grow
to lengths of six metres


169
0:16:7,9 --> 0:16:14,4
and weigh close to a ton


170
0:16:14,4 --> 0:16:17,9
Its power allows it to select
from a vast menu of prey


171
0:16:17,9 --> 0:16:20,4
including buffalo


172
0:16:20,4 --> 0:16:22,5
antelope


173
0:16:22,5 --> 0:16:27,8
and even young elephants


174
0:16:27,8 --> 0:16:49,8
A fully grown Nile crocodile
has few natural enemies


175
0:16:49,8 --> 0:16:52,2
Equipped with eyes on the top of its head


176
0:16:52,2 --> 0:16:53,9
it studies its prey‥


177
0:16:53,9 --> 0:17:1,5
and hides


178
0:17:1,5 --> 0:17:3,3
A Nile croc lying in wait


179
0:17:3,3 --> 0:17:10,7
can hold its breath for over 45 minutes


180
0:17:10,7 --> 0:17:12,7
But with a simple flick of its tail


181
0:17:12,7 --> 0:17:28,4
it catapults itself out of the water


182
0:17:28,4 --> 0:17:30,9
It grabs its prey by the head or limb


183
0:17:30,9 --> 0:17:48,4
and pulls the meal down
to a murky death


184
0:17:48,4 --> 0:17:52,0
Another water-borne creature
also lashes out with its teeth


185
0:17:52,0 --> 0:17:54,6
but this one is a herbivore‥


186
0:17:54,6 --> 0:18:1,2
the hippo


187
0:18:1,2 --> 0:18:15,3
Its placid demeanor belies
a volatile temperament


188
0:18:15,3 --> 0:18:16,4
During the day


189
0:18:16,4 --> 0:18:27,3
a water hole can offer cool refuge
from the searing African heat


190
0:18:27,3 --> 0:18:29,8
Here, a hippo is in its element


191
0:18:29,8 --> 0:18:37,0
Despite its substantial mass
the creature is buoyant


192
0:18:37,0 --> 0:18:40,1
When a three and a half ton hippo
slips below the surface


193
0:18:40,1 --> 0:18:42,4
it seals its nostrils completely


194
0:18:42,4 --> 0:18:53,5
and can hold its breath
for up to 30 minutes


195
0:18:53,5 --> 0:18:57,6
Hippos inhabit the watering holes
of west, east and southern Africa


196
0:18:57,6 --> 0:19:9,5
as well as the upper reaches
of the Nile River


197
0:19:9,5 --> 0:19:14,8
Only one predator
will hunt an adult hippo‥


198
0:19:14,8 --> 0:19:21,5
a pride of lions


199
0:19:21,5 --> 0:19:31,6
And even then, they're not easily taken


200
0:19:31,6 --> 0:19:41,4
Hippos can run at nearly
30 kilometres per hour


201
0:19:41,4 --> 0:19:45,8
The males wield 30 centimetre tusks
which they use in battle


202
0:19:45,8 --> 0:19:49,8
These giant canines
can deliver devastating wounds‥


203
0:19:49,8 --> 0:20:4,0
and are capable of
biting a crocodile in half


204
0:20:4,0 --> 0:20:7,7
But it's the females that
pose the greatest threat to humans


205
0:20:7,7 --> 0:20:10,0
They protect their calves fiercely


206
0:20:10,0 --> 0:20:25,9
even from other hippos


207
0:20:25,9 --> 0:20:27,7
With a newborn to guard


208
0:20:27,7 --> 0:20:41,7
an adult female
won't tolerate any intruder


209
0:20:41,7 --> 0:20:52,4
Every year, these leviathans
kill dozens of people


210
0:20:52,4 --> 0:20:54,4
Although their range is shrinking


211
0:20:54,4 --> 0:21:1,9
hippos still rule the water hole


212
0:21:1,9 --> 0:21:6,8
Africa's aquatic giants
are well adapted for survival


213
0:21:6,8 --> 0:21:9,1
Whether on dry land‥


214
0:21:9,1 --> 0:21:11,6
in the water‥


215
0:21:11,6 --> 0:21:13,6
or under it‥


216
0:21:13,6 --> 0:21:16,5
these animals are equipped
to deal with all threats


217
0:21:16,5 --> 0:21:18,6
and opportunities


218
0:21:18,6 --> 0:21:29,0
head on


219
0:21:29,0 --> 0:21:33,5
Africa is home to some of the most
awe-inspiring wildlife on the planet


220
0:21:33,5 --> 0:21:35,8
venomous insects‥


221
0:21:35,8 --> 0:21:38,4
toxic serpents‥


222
0:21:38,4 --> 0:21:44,1
and deadly predators


223
0:21:44,1 --> 0:21:47,4
But few species embody all that is Africa


224
0:21:47,4 --> 0:21:58,4
like its ancient giants


225
0:21:58,4 --> 0:22:1,2
This grazer weighs nearly a ton


226
0:22:1,2 --> 0:22:8,6
While it feeds, it's calm


227
0:22:8,6 --> 0:22:9,5
But suddenly


228
0:22:9,5 --> 0:22:13,3
it can transform into one of the most
dangerous creatures on the continent


229
0:22:13,3 --> 0:22:29,2
The hunter becomes the hunted
as the behemoth retaliates


230
0:22:29,2 --> 0:22:31,9
The cape buffalo spends 18 hours a day


231
0:22:31,9 --> 0:22:36,7
moving across the Savanna
in relative peace


232
0:22:36,7 --> 0:22:38,0
But when provoked


233
0:22:38,0 --> 0:22:40,9
the grass-fed giant
can prove a worthy adversary


234
0:22:40,9 --> 0:22:44,9
of both fierce carnivores like lions‥


235
0:22:44,9 --> 0:22:47,2
and trophy hunting humans


236
0:22:47,2 --> 0:23:1,2
who target the buffalo
for its ornate rack of horns


237
0:23:1,2 --> 0:23:8,9
It thunders along at the speed
of a galloping horse


238
0:23:8,9 --> 0:23:11,3
It can easily disembowel a predator


239
0:23:11,3 --> 0:23:13,3
with little more than
a slash of its horns


240
0:23:13,3 --> 0:23:33,8
or a well-aimed hoof


241
0:23:33,8 --> 0:23:35,3
100 years ago


242
0:23:35,3 --> 0:23:38,7
buffalo roamed nearly
all of sub-Saharan Africa


243
0:23:38,7 --> 0:23:46,3
But today, they're gone
from most of the south


244
0:23:46,3 --> 0:23:50,6
Yet they're still among the most
abundant large animals on the continent


245
0:23:50,6 --> 0:23:53,8
and the only thing
more dangerous than one buffalo


246
0:23:53,8 --> 0:24:8,4
is a startled herd, stampeding


247
0:24:8,4 --> 0:24:11,8
Another massive creature
shares the buffalo's territory‥


248
0:24:11,8 --> 0:24:18,0
but this one squeezes the life
from its victims


249
0:24:18,0 --> 0:24:21,8
It lies in wait
watching for its prey to approach


250
0:24:21,8 --> 0:24:33,8
and prepares to attack


251
0:24:33,8 --> 0:24:37,7
The African rock python
has a deadly embrace


252
0:24:37,7 --> 0:24:39,0
Unlike other snakes


253
0:24:39,0 --> 0:24:42,5
this constrictor doesn't strike with venom


254
0:24:42,5 --> 0:24:50,7
Instead, it kills with muscle


255
0:24:50,7 --> 0:24:54,9
African rock pythons
can weigh up to 135 kilograms


256
0:24:54,9 --> 0:24:57,3
and grow to over six metres‥


257
0:24:57,3 --> 0:25:4,3
making them among the largest snakes
in the world


258
0:25:4,3 --> 0:25:10,6
They live throughout the Savannas
and forests of sub-Saharan Africa


259
0:25:10,6 --> 0:25:12,5
Already powerful on land


260
0:25:12,5 --> 0:25:17,2
this brawny serpent employs an even
more impressive tactic from underwater


261
0:25:17,2 --> 0:25:19,7
where it glides with fluid grace


262
0:25:19,7 --> 0:25:21,0
Ever adaptable


263
0:25:21,0 --> 0:25:29,4
the pythons that live near water
thrive on fish


264
0:25:29,4 --> 0:25:32,8
And older snakes
can find even bigger prey here


265
0:25:32,8 --> 0:25:35,1
They wait underwater‥


266
0:25:35,1 --> 0:25:49,6
rising every 30 minutes
to take a discreet breath


267
0:25:49,6 --> 0:25:52,4
They can spend hours
in this coil of tension‥


268
0:25:52,4 --> 0:26:9,9
waiting for just the right moment
to strike


269
0:26:9,9 --> 0:26:12,3
Scores of teeth seize the prey‥


270
0:26:12,3 --> 0:26:25,7
and muscular coils envelop the victim


271
0:26:25,7 --> 0:26:34,5
Crushed, the springbok
is slowly asphyxiated


272
0:26:34,5 --> 0:26:46,5
The python can swallow up to
60kg of lifeless prey - whole


273
0:26:46,5 --> 0:26:48,4
After a meal like this


274
0:26:48,4 --> 0:26:52,4
it can fast for more than a year


275
0:26:52,4 --> 0:26:53,6
But even so


276
0:26:53,6 --> 0:27:4,6
it should always
be approached with caution


277
0:27:4,6 --> 0:27:6,6
This snake will defend itself


278
0:27:6,6 --> 0:27:9,0
no matter what the size of the threat


279
0:27:9,0 --> 0:27:11,7
So, although pythons rarely eat people


280
0:27:11,7 --> 0:27:18,4
they can still kill us


281
0:27:18,4 --> 0:27:20,9
Giants that are placid in appearance‥


282
0:27:20,9 --> 0:27:25,7
can sometimes transform into killers
when provoked


283
0:27:25,7 --> 0:27:28,0
But one of Africa's enormous animals


284
0:27:28,0 --> 0:27:38,9
is unexpectedly deadly


285
0:27:38,9 --> 0:27:42,2
It weighs more than a truck‥


286
0:27:42,2 --> 0:27:45,9
stands twice as tall as a human‥


287
0:27:45,9 --> 0:27:53,8
and can crush with a misplaced foot


288
0:27:53,8 --> 0:28:0,2
It's the world's largest land animal


289
0:28:0,2 --> 0:28:19,2
And if you enrage an elephant
its fury can be lethal


290
0:28:19,2 --> 0:28:22,8
Humans have pushed elephants
to the brink


291
0:28:22,8 --> 0:28:26,4
dividing their lands‥


292
0:28:26,4 --> 0:28:29,7
culling their ranks‥


293
0:28:29,7 --> 0:28:34,6
and causing disarray in their families


294
0:28:34,6 --> 0:28:42,7
And now, elephants are pushing back


295
0:28:42,7 --> 0:28:46,9
Once, they roamed much of Africa freely


296
0:28:46,9 --> 0:28:47,7
But today


297
0:28:47,7 --> 0:28:50,5
most elephants are confined
to patches of protected land


298
0:28:50,5 --> 0:29:4,0
in central, east and southern Africa


299
0:29:4,0 --> 0:29:7,2
Roads and farms divide them
from their traditional grounds


300
0:29:7,2 --> 0:29:20,3
and impede their timeless migrations


301
0:29:20,3 --> 0:29:21,5
As a result of this


302
0:29:21,5 --> 0:29:24,2
they're often forced
into unnatural habitats


303
0:29:24,2 --> 0:29:26,7
where they quickly exhaust food supplies


304
0:29:26,7 --> 0:29:37,4
and have to compete with
domestic herds for water


305
0:29:37,4 --> 0:29:39,7
While seeking out new territories


306
0:29:39,7 --> 0:29:53,7
they can ravage fields and gardens


307
0:29:53,7 --> 0:29:56,4
And all too often
this leads to confrontations


308
0:29:56,4 --> 0:30:3,7
with unarmed rural inhabitants


309
0:30:3,7 --> 0:30:5,3
In the 1990s


310
0:30:5,3 --> 0:30:26,2
more than 200 people were killed
by elephants in Kenya alone


311
0:30:26,2 --> 0:30:30,0
Efforts are underway
to reduce elephant overcrowding


312
0:30:30,0 --> 0:30:31,9
But with ever-decreasing territory


313
0:30:31,9 --> 0:30:38,4
their conflicts with us will only increase


314
0:30:38,4 --> 0:30:40,8
Of Africa's trio of ancient giants


315
0:30:40,8 --> 0:30:43,6
two are grazers‥


316
0:30:43,6 --> 0:30:49,1
and only one is a predator


317
0:30:49,1 --> 0:30:51,1
But all have earned a place


318
0:30:51,1 --> 0:30:59,6
among this land's most lethal animals


319
0:30:59,6 --> 0:31:2,9
A pair of predators
rules the African darkness


320
0:31:2,9 --> 0:31:5,2
One is a cunning hunter‥


321
0:31:5,2 --> 0:31:14,4
and the other, the ultimate survivor


322
0:31:14,4 --> 0:31:26,8
But neither is exactly
what it appears to be


323
0:31:26,8 --> 0:31:28,6
As they stalk in the darkness


324
0:31:28,6 --> 0:31:31,3
their invisible laughter
pierces the shadows


325
0:31:31,3 --> 0:31:43,4
and stirs panic in all who hear it


326
0:31:43,4 --> 0:31:55,8
These creatures are legendary
hunters and scavengers


327
0:31:55,8 --> 0:32:5,6
These are the eery calls
of the spotted hyena


328
0:32:5,6 --> 0:32:8,5
There are three species
of hyena in Africa


329
0:32:8,5 --> 0:32:12,3
the striped and the brown
which are solitary‥


330
0:32:12,3 --> 0:32:19,7
and the spotted
which is a highly social animal


331
0:32:19,7 --> 0:32:23,6
The spotted hyena ranges from
Senegal and Somalia in the north


332
0:32:23,6 --> 0:32:26,2
to Botswana and Namibia in the south


333
0:32:26,2 --> 0:32:31,8
making it the most common
large carnivore in Africa


334
0:32:31,8 --> 0:32:39,5
Clans contain up to 80 individuals


335
0:32:39,5 --> 0:33:10,4
But they break into smaller teams to hunt


336
0:33:10,4 --> 0:33:13,0
Once dismissed as maniacal 'laughter'


337
0:33:13,0 --> 0:33:17,3
their yelps, growls and whoops
act as a dinner bell‥


338
0:33:17,3 --> 0:33:19,5
a call to arms‥


339
0:33:19,5 --> 0:33:23,9
or a warning to their cubs


340
0:33:23,9 --> 0:33:28,0
Their body language also
sends signals to the clan‥


341
0:33:28,0 --> 0:33:30,4
intent to attack‥


342
0:33:30,4 --> 0:33:32,6
excitement‥


343
0:33:32,6 --> 0:33:40,3
or fear


344
0:33:40,3 --> 0:33:43,7
When clan territory overlaps
with that of other predators


345
0:33:43,7 --> 0:33:47,2
hyenas will intimidate
any carnivorous competitors


346
0:33:47,2 --> 0:33:57,2
and, if given the chance
kill their cubs


347
0:33:57,2 --> 0:33:58,9
They eat anything


348
0:33:58,9 --> 0:34:6,0
At a kill, nothing is left to waste


349
0:34:6,0 --> 0:34:8,7
The hyena's massively-muscled
head and neck


350
0:34:8,7 --> 0:34:11,6
power some of the strongest jaws in nature


351
0:34:11,6 --> 0:34:20,6
They can exert a bite force
stronger than that of a lion


352
0:34:20,6 --> 0:34:22,7
Hyenas are efficient hunters


353
0:34:22,7 --> 0:34:25,1
with the ability to crush, swallow


354
0:34:25,1 --> 0:34:28,2
and digest nearly every part of their prey


355
0:34:28,2 --> 0:34:35,6
including the bones


356
0:34:35,6 --> 0:34:38,8
They kill their prey with their brutal jaws


357
0:34:38,8 --> 0:34:40,7
But another of the night's hunters


358
0:34:40,7 --> 0:34:42,0
wields a much smaller


359
0:34:42,0 --> 0:35:16,9
but equally effective - weapon


360
0:35:16,9 --> 0:35:19,9
The toxic punch unleashed by this predator


361
0:35:19,9 --> 0:35:29,9
has earned it the name 'death stalker'


362
0:35:29,9 --> 0:35:32,9
This scorpion is only 10cm long


363
0:35:32,9 --> 0:35:40,7
but it's possibly
the most dangerous in the world


364
0:35:40,7 --> 0:35:42,8
400 million years ago


365
0:35:42,8 --> 0:35:45,2
long before the age of the dinosaurs


366
0:35:45,2 --> 0:35:48,7
scorpions were perfecting
the tactics, armour and venom


367
0:35:48,7 --> 0:35:55,5
that would ensure their success


368
0:35:55,5 --> 0:35:58,8
There are more than
1,200 different species on the planet


369
0:35:58,8 --> 0:36:7,9
and hundreds of them live only in Africa


370
0:36:7,9 --> 0:36:13,7
But the death stalker thrives
in one of the most extreme
environments on Earth


371
0:36:13,7 --> 0:36:16,8
The Sahara Desert
is the centre of its territory


372
0:36:16,8 --> 0:36:25,4
which stretches from
Egypt southwest to Mali


373
0:36:25,4 --> 0:36:28,8
Scorpions hunt the shadows
seeking out spiders


374
0:36:28,8 --> 0:36:37,4
small rodents and insects


375
0:36:37,4 --> 0:36:46,4
Their pincers snatch their prey
and prepare it for the kill


376
0:36:46,4 --> 0:36:55,7
Then the stinger injects the lethal blow


377
0:36:55,7 --> 0:36:58,9
Although a sting delivers
less venom than a snake bite


378
0:36:58,9 --> 0:37:0,6
the death stalker's toxins


379
0:37:0,6 --> 0:37:13,6
are nearly three times
as powerful as a cape cobra's


380
0:37:13,6 --> 0:37:16,7
Fever, convulsions
and increased blood pressure


381
0:37:16,7 --> 0:37:29,6
can wrack victims in
as few as five minutes


382
0:37:29,6 --> 0:37:33,0
But fewer than 3 per cent
of stings are lethal


383
0:37:33,0 --> 0:37:35,2
Children suffer the most fatalities


384
0:37:35,2 --> 0:37:47,7
because a dose of venom is far more
potent in their smaller bodies


385
0:37:47,7 --> 0:37:50,7
A pack hunter‥
and a solitary killer


386
0:37:50,7 --> 0:38:5,3
Africa's nocturnal predators
have a tactic for every occasion


387
0:38:5,3 --> 0:38:7,7
But among Africa's deadly dozen


388
0:38:7,7 --> 0:38:15,8
one animal reigns supreme


389
0:38:15,8 --> 0:38:19,3
With up to 250 kilograms of pure muscle


390
0:38:19,3 --> 0:38:32,1
it's the largest carnivore
on the continent


391
0:38:32,1 --> 0:38:35,0
They hunt in daylight and at night


392
0:38:35,0 --> 0:38:41,9
alone‥ or in teams


393
0:38:41,9 --> 0:38:45,3
There's no creature too big
or too smart


394
0:38:45,3 --> 0:38:47,1
for them to tackle‥


395
0:38:47,1 --> 0:38:51,0
even us


396
0:38:51,0 --> 0:38:53,7
When they catch an animal


397
0:38:53,7 --> 0:38:56,9
they just eat everything


398
0:38:56,9 --> 0:38:58,6
After falling down


399
0:38:58,6 --> 0:39:5,0
they started to bite me on the legs


400
0:39:5,0 --> 0:39:18,6
The lion is perhaps the most
formidable predator in all of Africa


401
0:39:18,6 --> 0:39:21,7
Once, lions roamed
nearly all of this land


402
0:39:21,7 --> 0:39:27,1
unsurpassed and unstoppable


403
0:39:27,1 --> 0:39:37,4
But then they met us


404
0:39:37,4 --> 0:39:39,6
Over the course of the last century


405
0:39:39,6 --> 0:39:46,8
humans have killed
hundreds of thousands of them


406
0:39:46,8 --> 0:39:52,2
Today, the big cats may number
fewer than 23,000


407
0:39:52,2 --> 0:39:55,6
Small numbers remain in
west African countries like Mali


408
0:39:55,6 --> 0:40:2,7
while other populations range
from Somalia and south to Namibia


409
0:40:2,7 --> 0:40:5,8
But most of them live
behind the long fences of reserves


410
0:40:5,8 --> 0:40:8,6
like South Africa's Kruger National Park


411
0:40:8,6 --> 0:40:23,6
sanctuary for more than 2,700 lions


412
0:40:23,6 --> 0:40:25,7
In November 1998


413
0:40:25,7 --> 0:40:27,4
park guard Sydney Maziya


414
0:40:27,4 --> 0:40:34,4
was shutting down the neighbouring
Marloth Game Reserve for the evening


415
0:40:34,4 --> 0:40:38,0
He received word that a gate
at the far end of the park was open


416
0:40:38,0 --> 0:40:46,3
and was given an order to close it


417
0:40:46,3 --> 0:40:50,5
The only way for Maziya
to cross the reserve was by bicycle


418
0:40:50,5 --> 0:40:53,3
even though there were lions around


419
0:40:53,3 --> 0:40:57,4
While I was still cycling to the gate


420
0:40:57,4 --> 0:41:10,0
I heard the sound of the lions


421
0:41:10,0 --> 0:41:12,9
Lions have nine different vocalizations


422
0:41:12,9 --> 0:41:21,4
but it's their roar
that indicates their domain


423
0:41:21,4 --> 0:41:31,4
And the roars surrounding Sydney
were coming from all directions


424
0:41:31,4 --> 0:41:37,8
Females - often sisters
form the core of a pride of lions


425
0:41:37,8 --> 0:41:45,4
They're joined by males who can be
nearly twice their size


426
0:41:45,4 --> 0:41:47,6
Together, they're armed with enough power


427
0:41:47,6 --> 0:41:54,5
to take down a buffalo
weighing nearly a ton


428
0:41:54,5 --> 0:41:57,7
Their muscular back legs
launch them towards their quarry‥


429
0:41:57,7 --> 0:42:18,5
while their agile front legs
pull the prey to the ground


430
0:42:18,5 --> 0:42:21,9
The fatal bite
is often delivered by a male


431
0:42:21,9 --> 0:42:28,4
and he's the first to feed


432
0:42:28,4 --> 0:42:30,7
But while their size helps them to hunt


433
0:42:30,7 --> 0:42:43,5
it comes at a price


434
0:42:43,5 --> 0:42:47,6
Every hunt is crucial
because it requires precious energy


435
0:42:47,6 --> 0:42:58,3
Ultimately, only about one in
every five attempts succeeds


436
0:42:58,3 --> 0:43:14,3
And in rare instances, some lions
turn to a weaker form of prey


437
0:43:14,3 --> 0:43:16,0
In 1898


438
0:43:16,0 --> 0:43:25,5
lions terrorized the track layers
of an East African Railroad Company


439
0:43:25,5 --> 0:43:30,5
Two notorious animals
killed and ate more than 120 people


440
0:43:30,5 --> 0:43:37,7
They became known
as the Man-Eaters of Tsavo


441
0:43:37,7 --> 0:43:39,8
After nine months of terror


442
0:43:39,8 --> 0:43:43,9
the project's chief engineer
Lieutenant Colonel John Henry Patterson


443
0:43:43,9 --> 0:43:49,2
finally shot the elusive cats


444
0:43:49,2 --> 0:43:52,5
Today, lions kill
dozens of people every year


445
0:43:52,5 --> 0:44:2,2
a statistic with which park guard
Sydney Maziya was all too familiar


446
0:44:2,2 --> 0:44:4,7
When the lion jumped over me


447
0:44:4,7 --> 0:44:18,3
what came in my mind was that
'oh now, I am dead.'


448
0:44:18,3 --> 0:44:28,1
Before long, more lions had joined
in the attack on Maziya


449
0:44:28,1 --> 0:45:0,2
The other lions that came to me
and started to eat me


450
0:45:0,2 --> 0:45:3,3
Then suddenly, his luck changed


451
0:45:3,3 --> 0:45:24,4
A truck appeared
and the driver had a gun


452
0:45:24,4 --> 0:45:28,8
They bite me on my thigh
on my knee


453
0:45:28,8 --> 0:45:36,2
After the lion left, I realized
how badly injured I was


454
0:45:36,2 --> 0:45:43,2
I was losing a lot of blood


455
0:45:43,2 --> 0:45:45,9
Sydney Maziya's mauled legs
are now mended


456
0:45:45,9 --> 0:45:47,8
and he's back on his feet


457
0:45:47,8 --> 0:45:51,3
But his encounter has left him
with a healthy respect


458
0:45:51,3 --> 0:45:56,2
for the most formidable predator
in Africa


459
0:45:56,2 --> 0:45:59,9
It is lucky if they don't kill you


460
0:45:59,9 --> 0:46:22,5
Because I know, usually
if they grab you, they kill you


461
0:46:22,5 --> 0:46:24,8
They're an elite group of 12‥


462
0:46:24,8 --> 0:46:30,4
embodying all of nature's
grandeur and power


463
0:46:30,4 --> 0:46:37,9
They have thrived with a vast array
of survival skills and defences


464
0:46:37,9 --> 0:46:42,9
They are Africa's Deadly Dozen
