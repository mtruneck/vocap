###17 SUROOSH ALVI: Well, Al Aqsa is basically Hamas television.
###21 Who owns the channel?
###23 Is it independently owned?
###24 BAHAAUDDIN AL GHOUL: We belong to the Palestinian
###26 rights, we say so.
###28 Just like the Israeli TVs belong to Israel, and Al Aqsa
###34 TV belongs to Palestine.
###35 It's the first Palestinian channel to produce resistance.
###41 The Palestinians have always said we want our land.
###45 People have the right to defend himself and to use
###50 resistance against the occupation force.
###53 If you could give us a well-targeted weapon that
###57 could only kill the soldiers of the Israeli, the
###62 Palestinians wouldn't use such ruckus.
###65 
###69 SUROOSH ALVI: The last time I came, in 2007, I met with an
###73 organization called Palestinian Media Watch.
###75 They're Israeli, and they sit and they just watch everything
###79 that you're making here.
###80 And they study it, and they analyze it, and then they go
###83 to make presentations to the US Congress.
###86 And they say look how radical the people in Gaza are.
###90 They're making Mickey Mouse with AK-47s.
###93 BAHAAUDDIN AL GHOUL: They also say to their people that
###96 killing a Palestinian is good.
###99 So there's a different way to see.
###103 If you look to the same video on an Israeli channel, they
###107 tell their people that killing Palestinians is a good thing.
###110 SUROOSH ALVI: Can you tell me about some of the risks that
###113 are involved with working as a reporter for Al Aqsa?
###116 BAHAAUDDIN AL GHOUL: Our office, which is now renewed,
###121 has been targeted with an F-16 bomb--
###125 totally demolished.
###127 Two of our cameramen's been killed.
###131 [INAUDIBLE]
###131 who was murdered by an Israeli rocket.
###134 Two of our correspondents have lost some of their body.
###138 Our cameraman has lost his two legs, and he shoot and shoot
###142 until he lost his legs.
###144 Made his legs cut, two legs.
###148 So this is an occupation.
###151 And the Palestinians who resist are
###155 called freedom fighters.
###158 They would like to get their homeland freed.
###161 If Isreal wants to stop, they can stop.
