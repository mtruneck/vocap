1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,84
DAN: The fact that we're all
friends, and we've sort of


2
0:0:3,84 --> 0:0:7,48
formulated a way to
coexist so nicely.


3
0:0:7,48 --> 0:0:8,89
So that's what makes
the clubhouse.


4
0:0:8,89 --> 0:0:9,57
It's fun.


5
0:0:9,57 --> 0:0:12,44
We've sort of got our little
schedule thing going.


6
0:0:12,44 --> 0:0:15,36
We all know when everybody's
starting to get hungry.


7
0:0:15,36 --> 0:0:17,7
We give each other the
eye a little bit.


8
0:0:17,7 --> 0:0:18,16
Craig.


9
0:0:18,16 --> 0:0:20,28
Get out the menu book.


10
0:0:20,28 --> 0:0:24,308
We want four veal
cutlet heros.


11
0:0:24,308 --> 0:0:25,87
We're going to see what
one of these seafood


12
0:0:25,87 --> 0:0:28,72
salads is all about.


13
0:0:28,72 --> 0:0:31,9
STEVE: Craig is our shop
assistant at Smith Street.


14
0:0:31,9 --> 0:0:33,77
Craig's sort of a little
different from the rest of us.


15
0:0:33,77 --> 0:0:37,27
Craig's very dark, and he's very
quiet and sort of morose


16
0:0:37,27 --> 0:0:39,57
and listens to really fucked
up dark music.


17
0:0:39,57 --> 0:0:41,3
Craig does everything.


18
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:43,85
We make Craig do everything.


19
0:0:43,85 --> 0:0:47,44
We can abuse him, and
he will not flinch.


20
0:0:47,44 --> 0:0:50,3
DAN: Plus we all need
to eat immediately.


21
0:0:50,3 --> 0:0:52,57
All these other guys will tell
him, that light bulb's out.


22
0:0:52,57 --> 0:0:53,47
This needs to be dusted.


23
0:0:53,47 --> 0:0:56,45
I'm like, yo, I need
that bagel order.


24
0:0:56,45 --> 0:0:58,92
He has no interest in food.


25
0:0:58,92 --> 0:1:1,36
He says that if there was a pill
that could sustain his


26
0:1:1,36 --> 0:1:5,66
life, he would just swallow
that pill and never eat.


27
0:1:5,66 --> 0:1:6,92
Doesn't like food.


28
0:1:6,92 --> 0:1:10,23
It's the strangest--
it's disturbing.


29
0:1:10,23 --> 0:1:13,1
CRAIG: Can I get three
veal cutlet heros?


30
0:1:13,1 --> 0:1:15,28
And can I have sides of
mayo for all those?


31
0:1:15,28 --> 0:1:17,25
Yeah, I don't really
like eating.


32
0:1:17,25 --> 0:1:22,132
I don't really find any
enjoyment in eating.


33
0:1:22,132 --> 0:1:24,89
I'm not a foodie by any means.


34
0:1:24,89 --> 0:1:27,45
DAN: A real dinner
usually ensues.


35
0:1:27,45 --> 0:1:31,17
We still do the massage
table family style.


36
0:1:31,17 --> 0:1:37,13
We do what we call Tuscan
dining, and Craig waits on us.


37
0:1:37,13 --> 0:1:41,85



38
0:1:41,85 --> 0:1:46,25
Hey Craig, are there any
IPAs or anything


39
0:1:46,25 --> 0:1:48,72
there in the fridge?


40
0:1:48,72 --> 0:1:52,5
Craig, come look at your worst
nightmare over here.


41
0:1:52,5 --> 0:1:54,71
One time, when Craig was a
little boy, and he was


42
0:1:54,71 --> 0:1:57,82
swimming in the ocean, one
of the fish brushed


43
0:1:57,82 --> 0:1:58,39
up against his leg.


44
0:1:58,39 --> 0:2:0,51
And he's never eaten a piece
of seafood since.


45
0:2:0,51 --> 0:2:3,9
See, if that was me, it would
be my mission to eat all the


46
0:2:3,9 --> 0:2:5,334
eels in the world after that.


47
0:2:5,334 --> 0:2:6,584
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


48
0:2:6,584 --> 0:2:10,229



49
0:2:10,229 --> 0:2:13,71
ELLI: We definitely enjoy
busting each other's chops.


50
0:2:13,71 --> 0:2:16,74
Dan and Craig have a lot of
squabbles at the shop.


51
0:2:16,74 --> 0:2:20,37
I think he likes to blame Craig
for a lot of stuff.


52
0:2:20,37 --> 0:2:22,8
And I think that's when you know
he's flustered, is when


53
0:2:22,8 --> 0:2:24,12
he starts yelling at Craig.


54
0:2:24,12 --> 0:2:25,55
DAN: Because he gets snippy.


55
0:2:25,55 --> 0:2:27,71
He does like the whole, get
it yourself, thing.


56
0:2:27,71 --> 0:2:29,5
Even though he'll
always get it.


57
0:2:29,5 --> 0:2:30,88
He'll just say get
it yourself.


58
0:2:30,88 --> 0:2:33,24
And some days I think it's
the funniest thing ever.


59
0:2:33,24 --> 0:2:34,2
And some days I'm
like, you know


60
0:2:34,2 --> 0:2:35,53
what, Craig, fuck yourself.


61
0:2:35,53 --> 0:2:37,27
Get it right now.


62
0:2:37,27 --> 0:2:38,58
STEVE: It makes him the
perfect floor guy.


63
0:2:38,58 --> 0:2:40,46
Because you can just give him so
much shit, and he just lets


64
0:2:40,46 --> 0:2:41,39
it roll right off his back.


65
0:2:41,39 --> 0:2:43,47
And it'll be very hard
to replace Craig.


66
0:2:43,47 --> 0:2:46,37
Craig is a great
shop assistant.


67
0:2:46,37 --> 0:2:49,48
I think as shop assistants go,
I feel like a lot of shops


68
0:2:49,48 --> 0:2:51,32
make their assistants
do nothing.


69
0:2:51,32 --> 0:2:53,23
And I'm like, what the fuck
are you getting paid for?


70
0:2:53,23 --> 0:2:55,78
DAN: Most floor guys
are bumbling.


71
0:2:55,78 --> 0:2:57,96
If someone comes up to the
counter, and is like, how much


72
0:2:57,96 --> 0:2:58,82
for this tattoo?


73
0:2:58,82 --> 0:3:0,76
And they're like,
[STAMMERING].


74
0:3:0,76 --> 0:3:1,475
They don't even know
what to say.


75
0:3:1,475 --> 0:3:2,42
They're like, uh.


76
0:3:2,42 --> 0:3:3,57
They get all nervous and shit.


77
0:3:3,57 --> 0:3:5,23
Whereas Craig's like
cool, calm.


78
0:3:5,23 --> 0:3:8,36
He's like the minimum is $100.


79
0:3:8,36 --> 0:3:10,45
He just handles it every time.


80
0:3:10,45 --> 0:3:15,32
I met Craig for the first
time at a Pratt party.


81
0:3:15,32 --> 0:3:18,2
He was visiting from Buffalo.


82
0:3:18,2 --> 0:3:20,93
Craig has a decent amount
of my tattooing.


83
0:3:20,93 --> 0:3:23,35
When he first started visiting
me in New Jersey, he'd always


84
0:3:23,35 --> 0:3:31,5
bring me these biblical
engravings, like Saint Peter


85
0:3:31,5 --> 0:3:33,11
being crucified upside down.


86
0:3:33,11 --> 0:3:37,69
There's this old wood cut, kind
of thing, of old scribe


87
0:3:37,69 --> 0:3:39,15
drawing in a book.


88
0:3:39,15 --> 0:3:44,62
And the book said something
about hate humanity, something


89
0:3:44,62 --> 0:3:46,31
or another, real misanthropic
stuff.


90
0:3:46,31 --> 0:3:49,55
So when he first started getting
tattooed by me, he


91
0:3:49,55 --> 0:3:55,91
just wanted these real metal
style biblical engravings.


92
0:3:55,91 --> 0:3:58,1
So he's got a lot of that
stuff on his forearms.


93
0:3:58,1 --> 0:4:2,35
And then he started to realize
that you can make a tattoo


94
0:4:2,35 --> 0:4:6,48
look like a tattoo, but it
can still be brutal.


95
0:4:6,48 --> 0:4:8,15
That's when I started
doing some of the


96
0:4:8,15 --> 0:4:9,69
bigger stuff on him.


97
0:4:9,69 --> 0:4:10,99
We did the back piece.


98
0:4:10,99 --> 0:4:15,11
The back piece is a depiction of
Snakeland, which are these


99
0:4:15,11 --> 0:4:17,68
abandoned grain silos
in Buffalo.


100
0:4:17,68 --> 0:4:19,91
It's kind of a metal icon.


101
0:4:19,91 --> 0:4:22,79
And there's a lot of
satanic stuff.


102
0:4:22,79 --> 0:4:25,17
And luckily Craig lived
right down the street.


103
0:4:25,17 --> 0:4:25,84
He grew up in there.


104
0:4:25,84 --> 0:4:29,17
He crucified a deer
in the place.


105
0:4:29,17 --> 0:4:30,13
The deer was dead.


106
0:4:30,13 --> 0:4:34,88
But he crucified a deer, among
some other things.


107
0:4:34,88 --> 0:4:39,94
So Craig needed to have that
on his back, as sort of an


108
0:4:39,94 --> 0:4:44,21
homage to his childhood,
and to Satan.


109
0:4:44,21 --> 0:4:45,79
Craig's not a killer.


110
0:4:45,79 --> 0:4:47,4
He's not a murderer.


111
0:4:47,4 --> 0:4:49,49
He's just a fucking weirdo.


112
0:4:49,49 --> 0:4:50,74
Yeah, he's just bad.


113
0:4:50,74 --> 0:6:50,74
