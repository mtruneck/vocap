1
0:0:4,28 --> 0:0:8,4
It's just all she seems to talk about
is this bloody dog, you know ?


2
0:0:8,4 --> 0:0:11,64
It's like "Ooh, Colin did this"
and "Ooh, Colin did that",


3
0:0:11,64 --> 0:0:13,16
and I'm sick of it, you know ?


4
0:0:13,16 --> 0:0:17,72
I should talk to her, but she's been so happy
ever since Colin arrived on the scene.


5
0:0:17,72 --> 0:0:19,48
She'd been having a hard time.


6
0:0:19,48 --> 0:0:22,24
She'd had some articles rejected,
she'd split up with her boyfriend.


7
0:0:22,24 --> 0:0:25,32
To top it all off,
her hair looked stupid all the time.


8
0:0:25,32 --> 0:0:28,4
Then Colin arrives on the scene
and she's writing again.


9
0:0:28,4 --> 0:0:37,6
She doesn't seem that bothered
about Richard and her hair looks good !


10
0:0:37,6 --> 0:0:41,24
Tim, I know how you feel about dogs
and I know how you feel about Daisy.


11
0:0:41,24 --> 0:0:45,56
Sometimes, where friends are concerned,
sacrifices have to be made.


12
0:0:45,56 --> 0:0:48,0
You're saying we kill the dog ?


13
0:0:48,0 --> 0:0:51,8
- No.
- Spoilsport.


14
0:0:51,8 --> 0:0:54,4
- Count to 100 ?
- All right.


15
0:0:54,4 --> 0:1:10,96
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...


16
0:1:10,96 --> 0:1:13,96
<i>I used to know this guy Minty,</i>


17
0:1:13,96 --> 0:1:18,4
<i>He had a dog who he'd train
to attack rich people,</i>


18
0:1:18,4 --> 0:1:20,92
<i>He was into the whole class-war thing,</i>


19
0:1:20,92 --> 0:1:24,8
<i>He called the dog Gramsci
after an Italian Marxist,</i>


20
0:1:24,8 --> 0:1:30,24
<i>Rumour has it, it could smell wealth
from up to 20 feet,</i>


21
0:1:30,24 --> 0:1:36,0
<i>The thing is, it all backfired,
Minty won 100 grand on a scratchcard,,,</i>


22
0:1:36,0 --> 0:1:42,96
<i>and Gramsci bit his knees off,</i>


23
0:1:42,96 --> 0:1:44,32
That's terrible.


24
0:1:44,32 --> 0:1:50,16
Not really. He used the money
to buy new knees.


25
0:1:50,16 --> 0:1:52,56
So what happened to Gramsci, then ?


26
0:1:52,56 --> 0:1:57,0
Well, no-one knows,
although some people still believe


27
0:1:57,0 --> 0:2:0,56
he roams wild on Hampstead Heath.


28
0:2:0,56 --> 0:2:4,68
Close to the meat.


29
0:2:4,68 --> 0:2:11,12
Hiya !


30
0:2:11,12 --> 0:2:13,56
- Is that it ?
- Well, it's not what it is.


31
0:2:13,56 --> 0:2:18,72
It's what it will be - a cold-blooded killer.


32
0:2:18,72 --> 0:2:21,8
It's a fact, sure as day follows night,
sure as eggs is eggs,


33
0:2:21,8 --> 0:2:24,64
sure as every odd-numbered
Star Trek movie is shit.


34
0:2:24,64 --> 0:2:27,2
- Ahhh !
- Mwah !


35
0:2:27,2 --> 0:2:30,92
- I'm going shopping. Do you want anything ?
- A crossbow ?


36
0:2:30,92 --> 0:2:33,2
And also, if Richard calls,


37
0:2:33,2 --> 0:2:36,48
tell him I'm out with Colin.


38
0:2:36,48 --> 0:2:40,4
We'll make him pay, won't we ?
We'll make them all pay.


39
0:2:40,4 --> 0:2:42,44
- Who's Richard ?
- Ex-boyfriend.


40
0:2:42,44 --> 0:2:44,36
- Your ex-boyfriend ?
- No, Daisy's ex-boyfriend.


41
0:2:44,36 --> 0:2:47,12
- My ex-boyfriend.
- Oh, I'm sorry. What happened ?


42
0:2:47,12 --> 0:2:51,64
Well, you know, I was upset
but I'm not any more, you know.


43
0:2:51,64 --> 0:2:54,92
In the end, our relationship
was just like a sandwich toaster.


44
0:2:54,92 --> 0:2:58,2
You know, you forget you've got one.


45
0:2:58,2 --> 0:3:0,96
It just sits on top of the cupboard
collecting a layer of greasy fudge.


46
0:3:0,96 --> 0:3:5,96
If you see it, you assume it's broken,
otherwise you'd be using it all the time,


47
0:3:5,96 --> 0:3:7,44
but you don't and it just sits there.


48
0:3:7,44 --> 0:3:11,92
Then one day, you get an overwhelming
desire for toasted sandwiches


49
0:3:11,92 --> 0:3:15,68
and you get it down and it works
and you can't believe it, you know.


50
0:3:15,68 --> 0:3:19,4
You make every kind of sandwich there is,
you have toasted-sandwich parties.


51
0:3:19,4 --> 0:3:21,64
You make Marmite and cheese
and chocolate and...


52
0:3:21,64 --> 0:3:23,32
- Pilchards.
- Banana and...


53
0:3:23,32 --> 0:3:25,2
- Acorns.
- Acorns.


54
0:3:25,2 --> 0:3:28,84
Then as quickly as desire comes, it just goes,


55
0:3:28,84 --> 0:3:32,4
and then you put
the toasted-sandwich maker away


56
0:3:32,4 --> 0:3:37,12
- and... you know what ?
- What ?


57
0:3:37,12 --> 0:3:39,0
You don't miss it.


58
0:3:39,0 --> 0:3:44,4
So what you're saying is "Don't hide
the toasted-sandwich maker away,


59
0:3:44,4 --> 0:3:46,84
use him regularly
and you'll get the most out of him."


60
0:3:46,84 --> 0:3:49,68
No, she's saying "Chuck your boyfriend,
have a sandwich."


61
0:3:49,68 --> 0:3:54,8
Anyway, I've got to go cos I'm meeting Twist.


62
0:3:54,8 --> 0:5:3,8
Don't you just love my hair ?


63
0:5:3,8 --> 0:5:6,96
How can you not like him ? He's so cute.


64
0:5:6,96 --> 0:5:8,4
Ahh !


65
0:5:8,4 --> 0:5:14,12
That's how it all starts, with "Oohs" and
"Aahs", but later there's barking and biting.


66
0:5:14,12 --> 0:5:16,44
He's a ticking timebomb of death, Daisy.


67
0:5:16,44 --> 0:5:21,2
You give him all the love in the world,
you spend years doting on his little furry head


68
0:5:21,2 --> 0:5:24,64
and one day you get back from aerobics
and there he is,


69
0:5:24,64 --> 0:5:27,56
panting over the half-eaten remains
of some hapless handyman


70
0:5:27,56 --> 0:5:29,48
you left fixing the tumble dryer.


71
0:5:29,48 --> 0:5:32,0
We don't have a tumble dryer.


72
0:5:32,0 --> 0:5:35,24
You will, my friend, you will.


73
0:5:35,24 --> 0:5:40,36
Look, Tim, I know
that I've been... insensitive, OK,


74
0:5:40,36 --> 0:5:44,4
and I do appreciate that you are riddled
with deep-seated psychological disorders.


75
0:5:44,4 --> 0:5:45,92
Thank you.


76
0:5:45,92 --> 0:5:50,2
But Colin lives here now and I'd like it
if we could all live happily, you know ?


77
0:5:50,2 --> 0:5:53,64
- Your mum remarried, didn't she ?
- What's that got to do with anything ?


78
0:5:53,64 --> 0:5:57,76
Well,... you know what it feels like to be...


79
0:5:57,76 --> 0:5:59,72
to be a stepchild,


80
0:5:59,72 --> 0:6:2,12
to be resented by a patriarch.


81
0:6:2,12 --> 0:6:9,36
My stepdad was a nice guy !


82
0:6:9,36 --> 0:6:14,32
Timmy boy !


83
0:6:14,32 --> 0:6:17,8
All right, I'll give it a try.


84
0:6:17,8 --> 0:6:19,2
Thanks, Tim.


85
0:6:19,2 --> 0:6:23,0
- So, what are you doing tonight ?
- Brian's coming up.


86
0:6:23,0 --> 0:6:24,32
To see you ?


87
0:6:24,32 --> 0:6:28,64
I went to a gallery with him last week, so
he's coming up to see the Star Wars Trilogy.


88
0:6:28,64 --> 0:6:30,84
It's like a cultural exchange thing.


89
0:6:30,84 --> 0:6:35,56
Do you mind if we sit in ?
We could be like independent observers.


90
0:6:35,56 --> 0:6:48,8
No, not at all. I'll get some popcorn.
And a muzzle.


91
0:6:48,8 --> 0:6:51,28
Ooh ! Sorry, mate.


92
0:6:51,28 --> 0:6:54,24
You idiot. Why don't you watch
where you're going ?


93
0:6:54,24 --> 0:6:57,4
Takes the fun out of it.


94
0:6:57,4 --> 0:7:1,12
I just know this street well. I've never seen
an evil, suspicious-Iooking man here before.


95
0:7:1,12 --> 0:7:4,64
What makes you think I'm evil
and suspicious-Iooking ?


96
0:7:4,64 --> 0:7:19,76
All right ! I was just being friendly.


97
0:7:19,76 --> 0:7:25,8
It's so moving.


98
0:7:25,8 --> 0:7:28,0
Little Ewoks.


99
0:7:28,0 --> 0:7:34,2
An entire empire brought to its knees
by small furry creatures.


100
0:7:34,2 --> 0:7:38,4
- That's my point exactly.
- Leave him alone.


101
0:7:38,4 --> 0:7:42,32
Did you notice that everything that transpired
in those films, and I mean everything,


102
0:7:42,32 --> 0:7:46,6
can be attributed to the actions
of one very minor character ?


103
0:7:46,6 --> 0:7:47,8
Who ?


104
0:7:47,8 --> 0:7:50,88
The gunner on the Star Destroyer
at the beginning of the first film.


105
0:7:50,88 --> 0:7:52,32
How come ?


106
0:7:52,32 --> 0:7:57,12
Well, if the gunner had shot the pod
that C-3PO and R2 were in,


107
0:7:57,12 --> 0:7:59,16
they wouldn't have got to Tatooine,
they wouldn't have met Luke,


108
0:7:59,16 --> 0:8:1,0
Luke wouldn't have met Ben,
they wouldn't have met Han and Chewie,


109
0:8:1,0 --> 0:8:4,12
they wouldn't have rescued Princess Leia -
none of it would have happened.


110
0:8:4,12 --> 0:8:7,16
Chaos theory.


111
0:8:7,16 --> 0:8:10,56
- Eh ?
- The predictability of random events,


112
0:8:10,56 --> 0:8:13,64
the notion that reality as we know it
- past, present, future -


113
0:8:13,64 --> 0:8:19,68
is in fact a mathematically predictable
preordained system.


114
0:8:19,68 --> 0:8:23,0
So somewhere out there
in the vastness of the unknown


115
0:8:23,0 --> 0:8:26,44
is an equation...


116
0:8:26,44 --> 0:8:28,76
for predicting the future ?


117
0:8:28,76 --> 0:8:33,52
An equation so complex as to utterly defy
any possibility of comprehension


118
0:8:33,52 --> 0:8:37,32
by even the most brilliant human mind,


119
0:8:37,32 --> 0:8:42,68
but an equation nonetheless.


120
0:8:42,68 --> 0:8:45,12
- Oh, my God.
- What ?


121
0:8:45,12 --> 0:8:46,2
What ?


122
0:8:46,2 --> 0:8:50,4
I've got some fucking Jaffa Cakes
in my coat pocket.


123
0:8:50,4 --> 0:8:52,0
Oh, Mama !


124
0:8:52,0 --> 0:8:53,96
Oh, Daddy, let's all play kabaddi.


125
0:8:53,96 --> 0:8:56,52
- You get 'em, Daise.
- I made the tea.


126
0:8:56,52 --> 0:8:59,44
I opened the window.
Brian, it's your turn to do something.


127
0:8:59,44 --> 0:9:3,12
- Colin needs to go out for a walk.
- I opened the window.


128
0:9:3,12 --> 0:9:6,6
Yeah, I made the tea
and Brian's getting the Jaffa Cakes.


129
0:9:6,6 --> 0:9:7,64
Shit !


130
0:9:7,64 --> 0:9:11,28
It'll give you a chance
to get to know each other.


131
0:9:11,28 --> 0:9:14,6
All right, all right,
I'll do it, if it'll make you happy.


132
0:9:14,6 --> 0:9:17,96
Come on, then, Cujo,
or whatever your bloody name is.


133
0:9:17,96 --> 0:9:37,12
Stay away from me, mind. Go on.


134
0:9:37,12 --> 0:9:41,88
What's the matter with you ?
Just do your thing.


135
0:9:41,88 --> 0:9:45,8
Just do it. Do it. Just go, will you ?


136
0:9:45,8 --> 0:9:52,88
Oh, right. Well, hurry up.


137
0:9:52,88 --> 0:9:56,8
Come on, you bastards.
I know you're up there.


138
0:9:56,8 --> 0:9:59,96
Come and get me.
Take me to your homeworld.


139
0:9:59,96 --> 0:10:4,64
Come on, abduct me !


140
0:10:4,64 --> 0:10:6,84
Shit ! Colin's been abducted !


141
0:10:6,84 --> 0:10:10,2
- What do you mean, he's been abducted ?
- Yeah, by a crocodile or something.


142
0:10:10,2 --> 0:10:16,92
- A crocodile ? !
- Or something.


143
0:10:16,92 --> 0:10:20,76
<i>- You let him go, didn't you ?
- Wha... ? !</i>


144
0:10:20,76 --> 0:10:22,92
- Daisy, I'm sure Tim...
- No, Brian !


145
0:10:22,92 --> 0:10:26,44
He's had it in for him from the start.


146
0:10:26,44 --> 0:10:29,72
Now, Daisy, I admit I wasn't keen
on the idea of getting a dog,


147
0:10:29,72 --> 0:10:32,28
but I would never stoop so low
as to do something like that.


148
0:10:32,28 --> 0:10:34,88
- I think you know me well enough.
- Do I ?


149
0:10:34,88 --> 0:10:35,8
Daisy !


150
0:10:35,8 --> 0:10:45,84
I obviously don't know you
as well as I thought !


151
0:10:45,84 --> 0:10:57,8
Ow.


152
0:10:57,8 --> 0:10:59,12
Do you want a Jaffa Cake ?


153
0:10:59,12 --> 0:11:1,68
No.


154
0:11:1,68 --> 0:11:3,76
I can't believe she'd think that.


155
0:11:3,76 --> 0:11:5,52
She's upset and not thinking straight.


156
0:11:5,52 --> 0:11:8,48
People say things they don't mean
in those situations,


157
0:11:8,48 --> 0:11:11,4
she's just lashing out
at someone close to her.


158
0:11:11,4 --> 0:11:13,44
Thanks, mate.


159
0:11:13,44 --> 0:11:16,44
It's all right.


160
0:11:16,44 --> 0:11:26,2
<i>So what did you do with it, then ?</i>


161
0:11:26,2 --> 0:11:28,24
Colin !


162
0:11:28,24 --> 0:11:30,92
Colin !


163
0:11:30,92 --> 0:11:50,4
- Colin !
- Colin !


164
0:11:50,4 --> 0:12:6,6
Colin ! Colin !


165
0:12:6,6 --> 0:12:9,2
Colin ! Colin ! Colin !


166
0:12:9,2 --> 0:12:12,32
Col... Oh, I'm sorry,


167
0:12:12,32 --> 0:12:15,92
I thought you were someone else.


168
0:12:15,92 --> 0:12:19,28
Colin !


169
0:12:19,28 --> 0:12:21,8
- Colin !
- Colin !


170
0:12:21,8 --> 0:12:24,28
- Colin !
- Colin !


171
0:12:24,28 --> 0:12:39,68
Come on, you little... Colin.


172
0:12:39,68 --> 0:12:42,96
- Any luck ?
- No.


173
0:12:42,96 --> 0:12:47,56
This came.


174
0:12:47,56 --> 0:12:52,0
"To whom it may concern, I'm writing to
inform you of the whereabouts of your dog."


175
0:12:52,0 --> 0:12:56,0
"Colin has been taken by a man named
James Eldridge, a freelance vivisectionist."


176
0:12:56,0 --> 0:13:1,92
"I cannot return your dog personally, but
the lab site is located 11-13 Kettle Road, N1."


177
0:13:1,92 --> 0:13:3,8
"Colin is being kept in Terrapin 5."


178
0:13:3,8 --> 0:13:6,56
"The lab has a skeleton security staff of one."


179
0:13:6,56 --> 0:13:10,2
"I hope this information is of use to you.
Yours in search of justice,...


180
0:13:10,2 --> 0:13:14,4
..a friend."


181
0:13:14,4 --> 0:13:18,44
This came with it.


182
0:13:18,44 --> 0:13:20,6
Call Twist, get Brian, I'll get Mike.


183
0:13:20,6 --> 0:13:44,72
- What are you gonna do ?
- We're gonna get our dog back.


184
0:13:44,72 --> 0:13:49,6
I'd like to thank you all for coming.
Daisy and me, we...


185
0:13:49,6 --> 0:13:53,28
We really appreciate it.
We all know this is gonna be tough.


186
0:13:53,28 --> 0:13:56,24
- Do you want a Bourbon ?
- Ooh, thanks very much.


187
0:13:56,24 --> 0:13:58,68
One of our number is in trouble
and we have to help.


188
0:13:58,68 --> 0:14:1,2
Thanks to the information obtained by Mike,


189
0:14:1,2 --> 0:14:4,6
- Hello.
- ..we've got a rough idea of the lab's layout.


190
0:14:4,6 --> 0:14:7,8
The main gate is here, the guard hut is here,


191
0:14:7,8 --> 0:14:12,4
and Terrapin 5, where we believe
Colin is being held, is here.


192
0:14:12,4 --> 0:14:15,16
We'll go over the fence here. It's two metres
high, so we'll have to do some climbing.


193
0:14:15,16 --> 0:14:17,48
- It's impossible.
- It's not impossible.


194
0:14:17,48 --> 0:14:21,8
I used to climb over my neighbour's fence
when I was a kid. It was about two metres.


195
0:14:21,8 --> 0:14:25,64
- Mike and Brian will handle the guard.
- Why Mike and Brian ?


196
0:14:25,64 --> 0:14:27,4
Because you're tallest
and Mike's good at handling people.


197
0:14:27,4 --> 0:14:34,64
Brian's not bad at handling people,
are you, Brian ?


198
0:14:34,64 --> 0:14:37,8
Once inside, Daisy, Twist and myself
will locate Terrapin 5.


199
0:14:37,8 --> 0:14:41,12
When we find it, Daisy and Twist
will stand guard and I'll go in for Colin.


200
0:14:41,12 --> 0:14:46,32
- Why are you going in ?
- Because I'm the one that lost him.


201
0:14:46,32 --> 0:14:48,36
I want you all wearing black tonight.


202
0:14:48,36 --> 0:14:50,44
<i>- All black ?
- All black.</i>


203
0:14:50,44 --> 0:14:52,16
I don't know much about security lighting,


204
0:14:52,16 --> 0:14:56,72
but I'm guessing they'll use 180-degree
dispersing halogens with motion sensors,


205
0:14:56,72 --> 0:14:59,88
so we'll have to stick to the shadows.
Any questions ?


206
0:14:59,88 --> 0:15:2,48
- Are charcoal-grey pumps OK ?
- Yes, they'll be fine.


207
0:15:2,48 --> 0:15:5,8
If we get separated, we'll meet
at the Beech Tree Inn on Stone Street.


208
0:15:5,8 --> 0:15:9,48
Brian, put your hand down.
Mike, I'll see you here at 2200 hours,


209
0:15:9,48 --> 0:15:25,84
everybody else, I'll see you here at ten.


210
0:15:25,84 --> 0:15:27,96
That's very...


211
0:15:27,96 --> 0:15:34,68
- That's very good, Mike.
- Ta.


212
0:15:34,68 --> 0:15:37,8
Well done, Daisy.


213
0:15:37,8 --> 0:15:41,68
- You've done really well, Twist.
- It's from the DKNY open-warfare range.


214
0:15:41,68 --> 0:15:45,16
- Well, great. Well done. What's this ?
- It's my make-up bag.


215
0:15:45,16 --> 0:15:48,76
We're rescuing a dog from an animal-testing
laboratory - there'll be lots of make-up there.


216
0:15:48,76 --> 0:15:50,56
- Oh, it's for luck.
- Twist...


217
0:15:50,56 --> 0:15:52,12
Tim !


218
0:15:52,12 --> 0:15:54,16
Let her take it.


219
0:15:54,16 --> 0:15:55,44
OK.


220
0:15:55,44 --> 0:15:59,72
When we get there, it's important while
we're doing this we don't use our real names.


221
0:15:59,72 --> 0:16:2,32
From now on,
we'll be using code names, OK ?


222
0:16:2,32 --> 0:16:3,2
Mike, you're Luke.


223
0:16:3,2 --> 0:16:4,4
Brian, you're Chewie.


224
0:16:4,4 --> 0:16:5,48
Daisy, you're Leia.


225
0:16:5,48 --> 0:16:8,52
Twist,... you're... Jabba.


226
0:16:8,52 --> 0:16:10,6
- I'm Han.
- Can't I be Han ?


227
0:16:10,6 --> 0:16:12,28
No !


228
0:16:12,28 --> 0:16:14,0
- Sound off. Luke ?
- Ho.


229
0:16:14,0 --> 0:16:15,2
- Chewie ?
- Erm, me.


230
0:16:15,2 --> 0:16:17,12
- Leia ?
- Yes, Tim... Han.


231
0:16:17,12 --> 0:16:18,88
- Jabba ?
- Is Jabba the princess ?


232
0:16:18,88 --> 0:16:20,6
Yeah.
- Here !


233
0:16:20,6 --> 0:16:27,84
OK. Let's go get Colin.


234
0:16:27,84 --> 0:16:29,88
Brian ?


235
0:16:29,88 --> 0:16:31,92
Come back in one piece.


236
0:16:31,92 --> 0:16:34,2
Yep.


237
0:16:34,2 --> 0:17:4,92
You know what piece I mean.


238
0:17:4,92 --> 0:17:8,92
OK, this is it, people. None of us
have ever done anything like this before,


239
0:17:8,92 --> 0:17:12,48
apart from Mike who, as we all know,
once stole a tank and tried to invade Paris.


240
0:17:12,48 --> 0:17:15,2
- Hello.
- We're through the looking glass here, OK ?


241
0:17:15,2 --> 0:17:20,4
We've been given a responsibility
and if we don't do this, nobody else will.


242
0:17:20,4 --> 0:17:22,8
Good luck, and I'll see you at the Beech.


243
0:17:22,8 --> 0:17:30,8
Go ! Go ! Go !


244
0:17:30,8 --> 0:17:33,52
- Oo-ooh !
- What are you doing ?


245
0:17:33,52 --> 0:17:46,76
The gate's open.


246
0:17:46,76 --> 0:17:51,56
Erm, excuse me.


247
0:17:51,56 --> 0:17:56,6
Excuse me.


248
0:17:56,6 --> 0:17:58,8
Excuse me !


249
0:17:58,8 --> 0:18:13,12
Let's play.


250
0:18:13,12 --> 0:18:16,48
OK, this is it. Stand guard.
If it gets pear-shaped, just go.


251
0:18:16,48 --> 0:18:18,52
Han !


252
0:18:18,52 --> 0:18:20,36
- Good luck.
- You too, Princess.


253
0:18:20,36 --> 0:18:33,6
Thanks !


254
0:18:33,6 --> 0:18:37,8
You must get terrible headaches
looking at the screens all day long.


255
0:18:37,8 --> 0:18:39,64
Oh, it's all right, really.


256
0:18:39,64 --> 0:18:43,24
I find if I keep
a little bottle of eye drops handy,


257
0:18:43,24 --> 0:18:46,0
it's not too bad, really.


258
0:18:46,0 --> 0:18:51,16
You should get one of those eye masks with
the cooling gel in. I find them very soothing.


259
0:18:51,16 --> 0:19:7,8
Oh, that sounds nice, yeah.


260
0:19:7,8 --> 0:19:9,64
Colin ? Colin !


261
0:19:9,64 --> 0:19:11,96
Colin !


262
0:19:11,96 --> 0:19:14,72
What if they set the dogs on us ?


263
0:19:14,72 --> 0:19:18,28
Don't worry, Twist. We trap 'em.
Ahh-ah, ahh-ah, ahh-ah !


264
0:19:18,28 --> 0:19:30,44
- Shh !
- Sorry.


265
0:19:30,44 --> 0:19:32,92
Colin ? Colin !


266
0:19:32,92 --> 0:19:35,84
I'm risking a lot being here, you know.


267
0:19:35,84 --> 0:19:38,8
You're only doing it cos you fancy Chewie.


268
0:19:38,8 --> 0:19:40,0
- Brian ? !
- Yeah.


269
0:19:40,0 --> 0:19:41,8
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-huh.


270
0:19:41,8 --> 0:19:43,72
- Uh-uh !
- Nn !


271
0:19:43,72 --> 0:19:57,64
- Uh-uh !
- Eh-eh-eh !


272
0:19:57,64 --> 0:19:59,72
Colin !


273
0:19:59,72 --> 0:20:1,48
Ahh !


274
0:20:1,48 --> 0:20:5,48
You stay back, OK, I'm coming in.


275
0:20:5,48 --> 0:20:10,36
Italian make, 9mm parabellum,
13 in the clip, one in the spout.


276
0:20:10,36 --> 0:20:13,36
Kill zone. Feel that.


277
0:20:13,36 --> 0:20:19,28
That, my friend, will mash up through
the engine block of a Fiat Uno, no problem.


278
0:20:19,28 --> 0:20:24,8
- How's it feel ?
- It's so cold.


279
0:20:24,8 --> 0:20:26,2
You're always wiggling your arse
when he's around.


280
0:20:26,2 --> 0:20:29,0
- I do not !
- You do, I've seen you.


281
0:20:29,0 --> 0:20:32,4
Yes, well, what about you and "Han" ?


282
0:20:32,4 --> 0:20:34,8
Tim ? !


283
0:20:34,8 --> 0:20:36,6
What about me and Tim ?


284
0:20:36,6 --> 0:20:43,84
- Run !
- Colin !


285
0:20:43,84 --> 0:20:46,12
Come on !


286
0:20:46,12 --> 0:20:53,0
Er, 14 across, three letters -
"To walk at speed, manage or oversee."


287
0:20:53,0 --> 0:20:54,24
- Run !
- Bye.


288
0:20:54,24 --> 0:21:1,32
No, wait !


289
0:21:1,32 --> 0:21:3,56
- We're stuck !
- Do something with it.


290
0:21:3,56 --> 0:21:8,2
No, you're all right, Officer. Must have been
a fox or something set off the motion sensors.


291
0:21:8,2 --> 0:21:16,4
No, everything's fine. You stay where you are.


292
0:21:16,4 --> 0:21:21,48
There you go.
There's, erm, a bit of a knack to it.


293
0:21:21,48 --> 0:21:24,92
It was you who sent the letter, wasn't it ?


294
0:21:24,92 --> 0:21:28,16
- Yeah.
- Why ?


295
0:21:28,16 --> 0:21:31,64
Well, Eldridge left one of the Portakabins
open last week.


296
0:21:31,64 --> 0:21:35,56
I couldn't believe it,
all those little animals in cages.


297
0:21:35,56 --> 0:21:39,68
I'd never have taken the job
if I knew what he was up to, but...


298
0:21:39,68 --> 0:21:44,52
I knew he'd clean away any evidence
if I went through the official channels,


299
0:21:44,52 --> 0:21:47,84
and when Colin arrived, I saw my chance.


300
0:21:47,84 --> 0:21:52,36
See, I... I've always been a bit of a yes man,
you see.


301
0:21:52,36 --> 0:21:55,28
Have you ?


302
0:21:55,28 --> 0:22:2,32
Yeah. So I thought it was time
I just stood up and said no.


303
0:22:2,32 --> 0:22:6,96
Aren't you worried about getting in trouble
with the police, being involved in a break-in ?


304
0:22:6,96 --> 0:22:9,84
It won't look very good
on your permanent record, will it ?


305
0:22:9,84 --> 0:22:12,52
There's not much I can do about that,
is there ?


306
0:22:12,52 --> 0:22:16,4
Wait a minute, everyone. I've got an idea.


307
0:22:16,4 --> 0:22:18,28
What ?


308
0:22:18,28 --> 0:22:21,72
Voilа !


309
0:22:21,72 --> 0:22:23,16
Blimey.


310
0:22:23,16 --> 0:22:31,8
There you go - it wasn't your fault,
we beat you up.


311
0:22:31,8 --> 0:22:38,36
Hey, I suppose I'd better call the police,
then, eh ?


312
0:22:38,36 --> 0:22:44,56
- You lot had better get off.
- Right.


313
0:22:44,56 --> 0:22:46,8
Colin says thanks. "Thanks !"


314
0:22:46,8 --> 0:22:52,52
- "Bye !"
-Bye.


315
0:22:52,52 --> 0:22:53,96
Daisy, look at this.

0:23:5,16 --> 0:23:8,56

Is anyone there ?


325
0:23:25,16 --> 0:23:34,4

this isn't the least bit amusing.
