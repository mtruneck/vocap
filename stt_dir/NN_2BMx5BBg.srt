Welcome... God, it's...


54
0:4:13,4 --> 0:4:17,72
Hello !


55
0:4:17,72 --> 0:4:19,44
Enough.


56
0:4:19,44 --> 0:4:21,36
So how are you ? How was Asia ?


57
0:4:21,36 --> 0:4:23,96
It was great.
I had a wonderful time.


58
0:4:23,96 --> 0:4:26,72
It was like, you know,
being in another country.


59
0:4:26,72 --> 0:4:30,8
It was a different world,
another universe.


60
0:4:30,8 --> 0:4:32,72
I feel very Zen. Very different.


61
0:4:32,72 --> 0:4:34,24
I don't know where to start.


62
0:4:34,24 --> 0:4:35,72
Near the end ?


63
0:4:35,72 --> 0:4:39,8
Where's Colin ?


64
0:4:39,8 --> 0:4:45,92
Ah, erm...


65
0:4:45,92 --> 0:4:49,12
Oh, you bastard.


66
0:4:49,12 --> 0:4:51,0
He's upstairs with Marsha.


67
0:4:51,0 --> 0:4:52,36
Is he all right ?


68
0:4:52,36 --> 0:5:0,12
He's fine. I'm sure he's fine.


69
0:5:0,12 --> 0:5:2,16
Check out the tan.


70
0:5:2,16 --> 0:5:4,88
Yeah, you look like Pocahontas.


71
0:5:4,88 --> 0:5:7,32
Thank you very much, Casper.


72
0:5:7,32 --> 0:5:11,16
- You know, the ghost.
- Oh, right.


73
0:5:11,16 --> 0:5:14,64
So how are you, then,
you big bloody man ?


74
0:5:14,64 --> 0:5:18,8
I'm good. I'm good. I've had
a few things to work through.


75
0:5:18,8 --> 0:5:21,64
- With Sarah ?
- No, with George Lucas.


76
0:5:21,64 --> 0:5:33,0
(# Star Wars theme)


77
0:5:33,0 --> 0:5:35,36
Tim, it's been over a year.


78
0:5:35,36 --> 0:5:37,68
It's been 18 months, Daisy.


79
0:5:37,68 --> 0:5:39,48
And it still hurts.


80
0:5:39,48 --> 0:5:44,96
I didn't think Phantom Menace
was that bad.


81
0:5:44,96 --> 0:5:49,12
It's nice to see you, Mike.
What've you been up to ?


82
0:5:49,12 --> 0:5:51,2
I'm in the quarterfinals
of Robot Wars.


83
0:5:51,2 --> 0:5:53,2
Wow !


84
0:5:53,2 --> 0:5:55,72
But I've had to
move out of Mum's place.


85
0:5:55,72 --> 0:5:58,84
- Really ?
- Things have been a bit... difficult.


86
0:5:58,84 --> 0:6:1,92
She's been very overbearing
and I felt suffocated.


87
0:6:1,92 --> 0:6:3,96
I've got a lot to offer the world,


88
0:6:3,96 --> 0:6:6,68
and my mum's not ready
to accept that yet.


89
0:6:6,68 --> 0:6:9,24
- Right.
- And I shot the cat up the asshole.


90
0:6:9,24 --> 0:6:13,12
Right.


91
0:6:13,12 --> 0:6:17,0
Well, we'll have to have
a party at your flat.


92
0:6:17,0 --> 0:6:21,84
Yeah... Actually, Daisy,
he's staying here. I spoke to Marsha.


93
0:6:21,84 --> 0:6:23,96
She said, "The more the merrier."


94
0:6:23,96 --> 0:6:26,52
As far as she knows, he's
staying in the spare room.


95
0:6:26,52 --> 0:6:28,76
Oh, right. Oh... my room.


96
0:6:28,76 --> 0:6:30,16
- Yeah.
- I see.


97
0:6:30,16 --> 0:6:32,92
Sorry to spring this on you,
he had nowhere to go.


98
0:6:32,92 --> 0:6:37,28
- There was a bed going, so...
- It's fine. Fine.


99
0:6:37,28 --> 0:6:45,44
Hope you haven't made
too much of a mess.


100
0:6:45,44 --> 0:6:47,72
He'll be on the sofa by tonight.


101
0:6:47,72 --> 0:6:50,8
Fine ! It's fine. It's fine.


102
0:6:50,8 --> 0:6:53,24
I've been sleeping rough
for two months.


103
0:6:53,24 --> 0:6:59,68
Another night's not gonna kill me.


104
0:6:59,68 --> 0:7:1,16
Let's see your photos.


105
0:7:1,16 --> 0:7:11,72
No need for photos.
Welcome to the 21st century.


106
0:7:11,72 --> 0:7:14,88
I got this cheap in Singapore.
Here we go.


107
0:7:14,88 --> 0:7:18,28
I've got three two-hour tapes.
I just couldn't stop filming.


108
0:7:18,28 --> 0:7:21,36
I'm thinking about going
into documentary filmmaking.


109
0:7:21,36 --> 0:7:24,16
Travelogues. A Michael Palin
for the millennium.


110
0:7:24,16 --> 0:7:27,12
I could use this as a pilot.
See what you think.


111
0:7:27,12 --> 0:7:30,52
See what you think.


112
0:7:30,52 --> 0:7:33,16
'Hello and welcome to Bangkok.'


113
0:7:33,16 --> 0:7:38,4
Yell if you get bored.


114
0:7:38,4 --> 0:7:46,6
'I've been here for about four
days. It's really early... '


115
0:7:46,6 --> 0:7:57,36
- Who is it ?
- It's Daisy.


116
0:7:57,36 --> 0:7:59,2
Hello, you.


117
0:7:59,2 --> 0:8:4,28
- Hi.
- Go there.


118
0:8:4,28 --> 0:8:6,56
- D'you want some tea ?
- Yes, please.


119
0:8:6,56 --> 0:8:10,96
I got you some lapsang souchong
because I knew you were coming back.


120
0:8:10,96 --> 0:8:12,36
Thanks.


121
0:8:12,36 --> 0:8:15,64
Did you have a great time ?


122
0:8:15,64 --> 0:8:18,6
Yes. Yes, I did. It was amazing.


123
0:8:18,6 --> 0:8:23,4
Incredible, you know.
So many different places and...


124
0:8:23,4 --> 0:8:27,32
Is everything all right ?


125
0:8:27,32 --> 0:8:31,48
- Yes ! Why ?
- You seem different.


126
0:8:31,48 --> 0:8:33,36
I feel different, Daisy.


127
0:8:33,36 --> 0:8:35,76
- Are you on Prozac ?
- No.


128
0:8:35,76 --> 0:8:39,56
I'm just... I don't know...
I'm enjoying life


129
0:8:39,56 --> 0:8:42,96
- and it's thanks... to you.
- Really ?


130
0:8:42,96 --> 0:8:44,76
It's because of you I met Twist.


131
0:8:44,76 --> 0:8:47,92
I can't believe
I was single for so long.


132
0:8:47,92 --> 0:8:51,4
Loooooove is
a beautiful thing, Daisy.


133
0:8:51,4 --> 0:8:54,12
You should try it !


134
0:8:54,12 --> 0:9:6,44
You two having fun, are you ?


135
0:9:6,44 --> 0:9:15,12
Well, Brian.
I'm very happy for you.


136
0:9:15,12 --> 0:9:17,48
Oooooh !


137
0:9:17,48 --> 0:9:19,96
Aaaaah !

0:9:19,96 --> 0:9:22,2
Eeeee !


139
0:9:22,2 --> 0:9:24,8

140
0:9:24,8 --> 0:9:27,16
- No, same one.
- 0ur one ?


141
0:9:27,16 --> 0:9:28,64
Yeah.


142
0:9:28,64 --> 0:9:31,76
- Hello !
- Marsha.


143
0:9:31,76 --> 0:9:33,52
Shit !


144
0:9:33,52 --> 0:9:39,32
- Hello, kitten. Welcome home !
- Hello !


145
0:9:39,32 --> 0:9:43,0
Hello, baby. How are you ?
How's he been ? Has he missed me ?


146
0:9:43,0 --> 0:9:46,8
He's fine. I had a bloke come
and put a dog flap out the back.


147
0:9:46,8 --> 0:9:48,92
He loves it. He's never in.


148
0:9:48,92 --> 0:9:53,4
That's cos Mummy's been away.
But she's back now, isn't she ?


149
0:9:53,4 --> 0:9:54,6
In your basket.


150
0:9:54,6 --> 0:9:55,68
Oooh.


151
0:9:55,68 --> 0:9:59,72
Well, come in. Come and sit down.


152
0:9:59,72 --> 0:10:3,0
Hello, you two.


153
0:10:3,0 --> 0:10:5,64
Nice to have you back, Daisy.


154
0:10:5,64 --> 0:10:8,8
I've got you something.


155
0:10:8,8 --> 0:10:14,28
Oh ! Duty free ! How did you know ?


156
0:10:14,28 --> 0:10:18,2
- How was it, kitten ? Was it magic ?
- Oh, yes. It was.


157
0:10:18,2 --> 0:10:21,2
I just feel energised, you know.


158
0:10:21,2 --> 0:10:25,4
I feel creative.
I feel absolutely good.


159
0:10:25,4 --> 0:10:27,52
Did you behave yourself ?


160
0:10:27,52 --> 0:10:28,72
What d'you mean ?


161
0:10:28,72 --> 0:10:30,44
Well, you know.


162
0:10:30,44 --> 0:10:33,84
Young woman away on her own
without her beau.


163
0:10:33,84 --> 0:10:35,88
Never know what might happen.


164
0:10:35,88 --> 0:10:40,64
Half a bottle of ouzo destructo
and ooh, the regret.


165
0:10:40,64 --> 0:10:43,4
I didn't actually go to Greece,
I went to Asia.


166
0:10:43,4 --> 0:10:46,12
I know. No, I was just saying.


167
0:10:46,12 --> 0:10:48,36
I trust you didn't play away.


168
0:10:48,36 --> 0:10:53,12
Oooooh.


169
0:10:53,12 --> 0:10:57,24
Well, there was...
There was one guy.


170
0:10:57,24 --> 0:11:1,24
Go on.


171
0:11:1,24 --> 0:11:5,24
'He was called Steven.


172
0:11:5,24 --> 0:11:8,0
'I met him at the airport
on the way home.


173
0:11:8,0 --> 0:11:10,16
'Nothing happened, just...


174
0:11:10,16 --> 0:11:12,76
'He was really sweet.'


175
0:11:12,76 --> 0:11:15,72
Ah, did he remind you of Tim ?


176
0:11:15,72 --> 0:11:19,4
Er, no. Not really.


177
0:11:19,4 --> 0:11:21,76
'We just sort of found each other.


178
0:11:21,76 --> 0:11:23,64
'Kindred spirits.


179
0:11:23,64 --> 0:11:25,56
'You know...


180
0:11:25,56 --> 0:11:29,16
'We talked for ages about
everything. It was great.


181
0:11:29,16 --> 0:11:32,36
'He was so easy-going.


182
0:11:32,36 --> 0:11:35,12
'I met a lot of really annoying
idiots on holiday.


183
0:11:35,12 --> 0:11:38,52
'Going on and on,
but Steven just seemed...


184
0:11:38,52 --> 0:11:41,84
'different.


185
0:11:41,84 --> 0:11:46,24
'I don't know. He made
me feel relaxed. At ease.


186
0:11:46,24 --> 0:11:53,16
'Like I could be myself.


187
0:11:53,16 --> 0:11:57,76
'What can I say ? He was like...
a real gentleman.'


188
0:11:57,76 --> 0:12:0,8
- So what happened ?
- I don't know.


189
0:12:0,8 --> 0:12:2,6
'We were at arrivals,
just chatting.


190
0:12:2,6 --> 0:12:16,32
'We were even gonna share a cab
and he just vanished.


191
0:12:16,32 --> 0:12:18,96
'I must have lost him
in the crowd.'


192
0:12:18,96 --> 0:12:22,4
Oh, well. You know what they say,


193
0:12:22,4 --> 0:12:25,84
why go out for hamburger when
you can have steak at home ?


194
0:12:25,84 --> 0:12:27,4
Get off me, you bummer.


195
0:12:27,4 --> 0:12:31,68
Oh, there she is,
duchess of the D grade.


196
0:12:31,68 --> 0:12:34,24
Doing her A Levels, bless her.


197
0:12:34,24 --> 0:12:35,96
Where the fuck have you been ?


198
0:12:35,96 --> 0:12:44,76
I don't mind you staying out late,
but at least you could phone.


199
0:12:44,76 --> 0:12:46,2
Right, I'm off.


200
0:12:46,2 --> 0:12:48,24
Hang on, I've got something else.


201
0:12:48,24 --> 0:12:51,64
- It's video footage of me.
- Oh, good.


202
0:12:51,64 --> 0:12:53,88
Just see what you think.


203
0:12:53,88 --> 0:12:57,28
It's nice to have you back safe,
Daisy. You look really well.


204
0:12:57,28 --> 0:13:8,68
A lot of people LOSE weight
when they're travelling.


205
0:13:8,68 --> 0:13:12,88
- You all right ?
- Yeah.


206
0:13:12,88 --> 0:13:16,4
I just feel a bit weird. That's all.


207
0:13:16,4 --> 0:13:20,84
This time yesterday,
I was in Delhi.


208
0:13:20,84 --> 0:13:24,68
- Oooh !
- The most magical city in India.


209
0:13:24,68 --> 0:13:29,28
Probably the world...
and now I'm just back in London.


210
0:13:29,28 --> 0:13:39,4
Where nothing ever happens.


211
0:13:39,4 --> 0:13:40,68
It's not here.


212
0:13:40,68 --> 0:13:46,6
We have the wrong bag ?


213
0:13:46,6 --> 0:13:47,8
Look.


214
0:13:47,8 --> 0:13:53,24
Daisy Steiner, 23 Meteor Street,


215
0:13:53,24 --> 0:13:54,92
Tufnell Park.


216
0:13:54,92 --> 0:14:0,4
What do you want to do ?


217
0:14:0,4 --> 0:14:10,72
Get the car.


218
0:14:10,72 --> 0:14:13,44
- Look.
- Look.


219
0:14:13,44 --> 0:14:22,28
Kick-slam.


220
0:14:22,28 --> 0:14:37,4
Come on, Daisy. Why don't you
come and have a fight ?


221
0:14:37,4 --> 0:14:38,64
No.


222
0:14:38,64 --> 0:14:42,68
Suit yourself.


223
0:14:42,68 --> 0:14:44,24
Can't we go down the pub ?


224
0:14:44,24 --> 0:14:45,52
The pub ?


225
0:14:45,52 --> 0:14:47,44
I REALLY want to go.


226
0:14:47,44 --> 0:14:51,72
I fancy a pint of Guinness and
some salt and vinegar crisps.


227
0:14:51,72 --> 0:14:54,48
I'm jet-lagged and I don't
want to fall asleep.


228
0:14:54,48 --> 0:14:58,88
Daisy ! Coming ?


229
0:14:58,88 --> 0:15:3,76
Yeah, just give me a second.


230
0:15:3,76 --> 0:15:7,6
I'm wearing nothing at all.


231
0:15:7,6 --> 0:15:14,76
What are you wearing ?


232
0:15:14,76 --> 0:15:17,4
Ooh, Prada.


233
0:15:17,4 --> 0:15:21,52
What's Prada ?


234
0:15:21,52 --> 0:15:24,28
- Is he coming ?
- I left him a note.


235
0:15:24,28 --> 0:15:26,52
Right, you can buy
the first round.


236
0:15:26,52 --> 0:15:28,8
- I've only got rupees.
- God, all right.


237
0:15:28,8 --> 0:15:31,8
- Mike can get the first round.
- What ?


238
0:15:31,8 --> 0:16:7,4
I just want to have
a nice, relaxing day.


239
0:16:7,4 --> 0:16:8,84
- Yes ?
- Daisy Steiner ?


240
0:16:8,84 --> 0:16:10,4
Yes.


241
0:16:10,4 --> 0:16:14,8
- Are you Daisy Steiner ?
- No.


242
0:16:14,8 --> 0:16:15,92
Do you know where she is ?


243
0:16:15,92 --> 0:16:18,68
- No.
- Do you know where she is ?


244
0:16:18,68 --> 0:16:20,8
Why ?


245
0:16:20,8 --> 0:16:23,48
Miss Steiner is under suspicion
of bringing a bag


246
0:16:23,48 --> 0:16:26,6
containing sensitive materials
into the country.


247
0:16:26,6 --> 0:16:27,8
Sensitive...


248
0:16:27,8 --> 0:16:30,36
Can you tell us
where she is, Mr Topp ?


249
0:16:30,36 --> 0:16:33,6
How do you know my name ?


250
0:16:33,6 --> 0:16:37,56
It's written on the doorbell.


251
0:16:37,56 --> 0:16:38,76
Oh, right.


252
0:16:38,76 --> 0:16:40,28
Where is she, Brian ?


253
0:16:40,28 --> 0:16:43,88
Brian isn't on the doorbell.


254
0:16:43,88 --> 0:16:49,8
- Where is she ?
- Er...


255
0:16:49,8 --> 0:17:18,52
What pub ?


256
0:17:18,52 --> 0:17:21,12
Right, I'm off to point
the pink pistol


257
0:17:21,12 --> 0:17:30,6
at the porcelain firing range.


258
0:17:30,6 --> 0:17:37,4
0i oi.


259
0:17:37,4 --> 0:17:40,48
Come on, Daisy. It can't be
that bad being back.


260
0:17:40,48 --> 0:17:44,2
I'm fine. I was really
looking forward to coming back.


261
0:17:44,2 --> 0:17:45,8
Seeing everybody.


262
0:17:45,8 --> 0:17:49,76
Yeah, I've been looking forward
to seeing you, too. I have.


263
0:17:49,76 --> 0:17:52,44
It's been really weird
since you've been away.


264
0:17:52,44 --> 0:17:54,32
The flat's been very different.


265
0:17:54,32 --> 0:17:59,4
- There's been... something missing.
- Really, what ?


266
0:17:59,4 --> 0:18:4,12
Um... The smell.


267
0:18:4,12 --> 0:18:6,68
- Daisy Steiner ?
- Yeah.


268
0:18:6,68 --> 0:18:8,52
Would you come with us, please ?


269
0:18:8,52 --> 0:18:9,72
Where are you going ?


270
0:18:9,72 --> 0:18:11,88
Would you come with us, please ?


271
0:18:11,88 --> 0:18:13,28
No. I'm all right here.


272
0:18:13,28 --> 0:18:15,76
Miss Steiner,
I don't want to tell you again.


273
0:18:15,76 --> 0:18:17,6
I think you should go with them.


274
0:18:17,6 --> 0:18:19,52
No. I don't know who they are.


275
0:18:19,52 --> 0:18:21,56
Miss Steiner,
you are under suspicion


276
0:18:21,56 --> 0:18:24,24
of illegally bringing
sensitive materials


277
0:18:24,24 --> 0:18:26,76
- into the country.
- What, a kite ?


278
0:18:26,76 --> 0:18:31,12
We have your partner in custody,
Miss Steiner.


279
0:18:31,12 --> 0:18:34,36
- Your partner ?
- A Mr Steven Edwards.


280
0:18:34,36 --> 0:18:37,68
Who is Steven Edwards, Daisy ?


281
0:18:37,68 --> 0:18:38,88
Daisy !


282
0:18:38,88 --> 0:18:43,4
'He was like a real gentleman.


283
0:18:43,4 --> 0:18:46,0
'Gentleman. Gentleman.'


284
0:18:46,0 --> 0:18:49,24
- Little shit.
- Who is Steven Edwards ?


285
0:18:49,24 --> 0:18:51,4
- We met at the airport.
- Did you ?


286
0:18:51,4 --> 0:18:56,48
- Miss Steiner.
- Do you mind ? I'm... 0w !


287
0:18:56,48 --> 0:19:4,4
Say hello to my little friend.


288
0:19:4,4 --> 0:19:6,36
Huh ?


289
0:19:6,36 --> 0:19:35,2
Shit !


290
0:19:35,2 --> 0:19:37,48
That just happened, didn't it ?


291
0:19:37,48 --> 0:19:48,32
Er, yeah.


292
0:19:48,32 --> 0:19:51,32
'Here we are
going down the corridor.


293
0:19:51,32 --> 0:19:53,48
'Hello.'


294
0:19:53,48 --> 0:19:56,96
Stop walking in front of the
telly. Your tights are strobing.


295
0:19:56,96 --> 0:19:59,96
You will go out looking like a...


296
0:19:59,96 --> 0:20:4,88
Bloody hell !


297
0:20:4,88 --> 0:20:7,36
Note to self.
Shoot first, quip later.


298
0:20:7,36 --> 0:20:10,24
Where did you learn to take care
of yourself like that ?


299
0:20:10,24 --> 0:20:21,4
Let's say my time in Asia wasn't
just spent sightseeing.


300
0:20:21,4 --> 0:20:26,4
I've changed, Tim.


301
0:20:26,4 --> 0:20:31,84
Your front door's open.


302
0:20:31,84 --> 0:20:36,96
- Brian.
- Welcome home, Miss Steiner.


303
0:20:36,96 --> 0:20:39,28
They arrived just before you did.


304
0:20:39,28 --> 0:20:41,4
You Lando.


305
0:20:41,4 --> 0:20:42,64
Take a seat, Miss Steiner.


306
0:20:42,64 --> 0:20:46,8
And let us not have a repeat
of our last encounter.


307
0:20:46,8 --> 0:20:49,24
You're beginning to try my patience.


308
0:20:49,24 --> 0:20:51,36
We have the bag, Miss Steiner.


309
0:20:51,36 --> 0:20:54,48
- I didn't know I had it.
- There's no point resisting.


310
0:20:54,48 --> 0:20:56,96
You have illegally carried goods
into this country,


311
0:20:56,96 --> 0:20:59,52
contravening
every customs law there is


312
0:20:59,52 --> 0:21:2,68
and we have all the evidence
we need to bring you in.


313
0:21:2,68 --> 0:21:5,8
No, you don't.


314
0:21:5,8 --> 0:21:9,28
- Marsha !
- Hello, everybody.


315
0:21:9,28 --> 0:21:13,36
Hello, Brian.


316
0:21:13,36 --> 0:21:14,56
What is this ?


317
0:21:14,56 --> 0:21:16,6
I think this
will clear everything up.


318
0:21:16,6 --> 0:21:21,84
- We don't have time for this.
- Oi !


319
0:21:21,84 --> 0:21:42,6
- Timmy !
- Wait !


320
0:21:42,6 --> 0:21:44,96
Thanks for your help, Mrs Klein.


321
0:21:44,96 --> 0:21:50,56
- It's Miss, actually.
- Miss Klein.


322
0:21:50,56 --> 0:21:53,4
We'll keep this for study,
Miss Steiner.


323
0:21:53,4 --> 0:21:56,48
Don't even think
about leaving the country.


324
0:21:56,48 --> 0:22:0,36
Don't worry. I won't.


325
0:22:0,36 --> 0:22:23,4
I can't afford it.


326
0:22:23,4 --> 0:22:33,56
That's better.
You'd never know he'd been here.


327
0:22:33,56 --> 0:22:35,92
Aw, he's like a giant baby.


328
0:22:35,92 --> 0:22:37,88
With a moustache.


329
0:22:37,88 --> 0:22:41,8
Thanks for letting him stay.
He won't be here too long.


330
0:22:41,8 --> 0:22:43,12
That's Ok. I like having him here.


331
0:22:43,12 --> 0:22:45,88
I'm sorry about your kite.


332
0:22:45,88 --> 0:22:48,4
- My kite ?
- Yeah. I got it for you.


333
0:22:48,4 --> 0:22:49,96
- Did you ?
- Yeah.


334
0:22:49,96 --> 0:22:53,16
Sure you didn't get it
for Steven Edwards ?


335
0:22:53,16 --> 0:22:56,12
It was a weird day, wasn't it ?


336
0:22:56,12 --> 0:22:59,84
- Sort of...
- Slightly unbelievable.


337
0:22:59,84 --> 0:23:6,0
- It's nice to be back, though.
- It's nice to have you back.


338
0:23:6,0 --> 0:23:10,92
Get off me, you Joey.


339
0:23:10,92 --> 0:23:13,4
'Hello and welcome to Bangkok.


340
0:23:13,4 --> 0:23:17,52
'I am in the Phad Phang
Pang Pong Phankam...


341
0:23:17,52 --> 0:23:21,32
'It's something like that...
Memorial Peace Gardens.


342
0:23:21,32 --> 0:23:24,64
'I've been here
for about four days.


343
0:23:24,64 --> 0:23:26,16
'It's early in the morning.


344
0:23:26,16 --> 0:23:33,64
'It's about five
so it's quite chilly.'


345
0:23:33,64 --> 0:25:33,64
I hate this job.
