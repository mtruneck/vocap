###1 FELICIA: Hello everybody.
###3 I believe that we are live.
###4 This is Vaginal Fantasy Book Club.
###7 It is a romance book club that I have with my co-hosts here
###12 who are in order, Bonnie Burton.
###15 BONNIE: Hello.
###16 FELICIA: Kiala Kasebee.
###18 KIALA: Hello.
###20 FELICIA: Veronica Belmont.
###21 VERONICA: Hello.
###22 FELICIA: And me, Felicia Day.
###24 Monthly we have a different book and a different alt book
###27 that we discuss.
###27 And we talk about just general things as well
###30 that are on our forums.
###32 We have a group on goodreads.com.
###35 And it's under Vaginal Fantasy so just search there and you
###38 can join in on the discussion during the month around the
###41 books that we're reading.
###42 Before we get into the book this month, which was Succubus
###46 Blues, how's was everybody's holiday?
###48 BONNIE: First of all, you have to mention
###50 we're all in our pajamas.
###51 FELICIA: Oh yeah.
###53 And I don't even understand how that happened.
###55 BONNIE: That's my fault.
###56 Because it's a Sunday and on Sundays I get up late gamer
###64 style like at around one and then walk my dog.
###68 And then get back into my pj's and spend the entire day
###71 reading comics.
###71 VERONICA: Your dog lets you wake up at one?
###74 BONNIE: My dog is awesome.
###75 Sophie has a snooze button.
###78 VERONICA: Oh my God.
###79 KIALA: Well I just never get out of my pajamas.
###81 But these are fancier pajamas that I got for Christmas.
###84 BONNIE: They are.
###84 Are those silk?
###86 KIALA: Yeah, or something.
###87 They're silky.
###88 
###90 FELICIA: Was that the best present that you got?
###92 KIALA: No, I think this was the best present that I got.
###96 BONNIE: Aw.
###97 VERONICA: That's cute.
###98 KIALA: It's a Squishable and it's limited edition.
###100 And it's like 35 out of 1,000.
###103 And I named her Anna Kareninamonk, because I've
###107 been watching Anna Karenina a lot.
###110 I love her.
###112 BONNIE: Do you want to see what I
###113 got myself for Christmas?
###116 FELICIA: Is that the favorite thing you got for Christmas
###118 that's saying something about yourself?
###119 BONNIE: I got a dead bat.
###121 VERONICA: Whoa, hey, dead bat.
###123 That's a dead bat.
###124 BONNIE: It's a dead bat.
###125 VERONICA: That's nice.
###125 BONNIE: Thanks a lot.
###126 It's for my taxidermy collection.
###129 FELICIA: Where do you go to get
###129 something like that Bonnie?
###131 BONNIE: Believe in or not, San Francisco has two whimsical
###134 taxidermy stores.
###135 One's called Love To Death which is on Oddities, which
###138 you can watch the TV show Oddities.
###140 And the other one's called Paxton Gate and it's in the
###142 [INAUDIBLE].
###143 I'm like Norm at both of them.
###146 They know me on a first name basis.
###148 Because I have a lot of taxidermy in my house, which
###151 probably explains why I'm going to die alone.
###154 KIALA: Paxton Gate's the one right by the McSweeney store,
###157 the pirate store, right?
###157 BONNIE: Yeah, it's right next to McSweeney's store.
###158 KIALA: And Borderlands on that same--
###160 FELICIA: That sounds like a fun place to visit.
###161 VERONICA: On the most awesome block ever.
###164 KIALA: Yeah it's the best block and it's
###166 just an amazing store.
###167 BONNIE: Yeah Felicia next time you come visit, and Kiala, we
###169 have to do a little trip.
###172 KIALA: That's my favorite area,
###174 Valencia, that whole area.
###176 BONNIE: Veronica, yeah, you know that area well too.
###178 VERONICA: Definitely.
###179 BONNIE: Everybody knows that place.
###180 FELICIA: Veronica you got something for Christmas that
###182 you should bring in the room.
###184 BONNIE: Yes.
###184 VERONICA: I can't bring it in the room but hold on.
###187 Let me show you the thing.
###189 Hold on, let's see.
###190 FELICIA: You've got to bring that in.
###190 VERONICA: Let me get inception for a second.
###192 Can you see it?
###193 FELICIA: Aw.
###193 Oh my gosh.
###195 VERONICA: That is Liberty.
###197 BONNIE: Why aren't you tweeting the puppy more?
###199 VERONICA: I'm trying to, although I'm so busy half the
###201 time trying to get her to not destroy me that it's kind of
###205 difficult to.
###206 She's a biter.
###206 She's a little bit of a biter.
###209 So she's great though.
###210 She's a guide dog puppy that we're raising until she's
###212 around 15 months if all goes according to plan.
###214 And then when she's 15 months she'll hopefully go to guide
###217 dog puppy college and help out a blind person.
###220 BONNIE: Aw.
###221 FELICIA: That's beautiful, but I would never be able to let
###223 my puppy go.
###224 KIALA: That's going to be hard.
###225 FELICIA: That's going to be horrible, dude.
###226 VERONICA: She's a lot of work so we'll see how that goes.
###229 FELICIA: I told you dogs were not easy.
###230 They'll come up to me and look at you
###232 like, let's do something.
###233 And you just--
###234 what do you want from me?
###235 BONNIE: I don't know but my dog's pretty cool.
###238 She's asleep right now.
###239 VERONICA: Well the hard part is by the time they get really
###243 well trained and kind of chill and you can take them
###246 everywhere is when you have to give them away.
###248 So by the time you get to that perfect point you're like, OK.
###251 Go out into the world.
###254 BONNIE: It's almost like dating.
###256 As soon as they're awesome, they leave.
###258 VERONICA: Yeah.
###259 KIALA: I'm opening this because I can't stand--
###261 FELICIA: Oh yeah, what are we drinking today?
###262 VERONICA: Hot Toddy.
###264 FELICIA: What's in a Hot Toddy Veronica, for people who
###266 aren't familiar?
###267 VERONICA: I'm using Bulleit bourbon, also
###269 honey, lemon, and tea.
###271 FELICIA: Nice.
###272 VERONICA: My little tea plant from Adagio.
###274 FELICIA: What are you doing, Bonnie?
###275 BONNIE: I'm drinking, in my Batman
###277 glass, coffee and Kahlua.
###280 FELICIA: Oh nice.
###281 Kiala, what are you drinking?
###283 KIALA: Tiny champagne.
###284 A Chandon--
###286 VERONICA: Do you have any orange juice?
###288 KIALA: No.
###289 It's a mimosa without, just hold the orange juice.
###291 BONNIE: It's just Mo.
###292 Mi.
###293 VERONICA: It's a mo.
###293 BONNIE: Sa.
###294 KIALA: But it's a twist off cap.
###298 I am the trashiest.
###299 BONNIE: You know what?
###300 VERONICA: I don't like twist off caps.
###301 KIALA: I like them but I feel not classy.
###303 BONNIE: You should try the Sophia Coppola champagne.
###306 I think it's pink and that has a twist off cap.
###309 FELICIA: Ooh.
###310 I like her movies.
###311 BONNIE: Also if you want to make Bellinis there's a really
###314 good peach champagne.
###316 FELICIA: You had grumpy cat face on Kiala.
###317 KIALA: Yeah--
###319 
###321 BONNIE: OK.
###321 Well--
###322 FELICIA: Oh wait, sorry Bonnie.
###324 KIALA: Oh I'm sorry Bonnie.
###325 FELICIA: You were finishing your pink champagne.
###326 Pink champagne.
###327 BONNIE: Oh yeah, I was just saying that I drink way over
###331 the top lame ass champagne.
###333 So I always drink peach flavored champagne, and I mix
###337 it with peach juice, and make Bellinis.
###340 Oh you guys are all making a horrible face.
###343 VERONICA: We were making the grumpy cat face.
###345 FELICIA: We're doing grumpy cat face.
###348 BONNIE: Am I being too white trash?
###349 I mean, I only drink Cristal in a diamond goblet.
###355 VERONICA: You've got to get sturgeon face in there too.
###357 It's all about the sturgeon face.
###359 BONNIE: No, do grumpy cat.
###361 Do grumpy cat, Veronica.
###362 Grumpy cat.
###364 VERONICA: There we go.
###366 FELICIA: I think we lost--
###367 I went to Jamaica for the holidays.
###370 And I didn't do--
###372 well I actually didn't do much.
###374 But at the airport they had a couple things that I got.
###377 So I'm drinking this overproof rum, which I
###380 didn't know they made.
###381 I don't understand.
###381 Is that more alcohol then?
###383 VERONICA: Yeah, I guess.
###384 Is that like overclocking your PC except with rum?
###387 FELICIA: It's 63% volume alcohol.
###389 Is that a lot?
###390 BONNIE: Let's find out.
###391 VERONICA: 60%?
###392 60% is pretty high.
###393 FELICIA: 63.
###394 VERONICA: 63% is pretty high.
###395 FELICIA: And then I got this Magnum Tonic Wine with iron
###401 and vitamins made with vigorton.
###403 VERONICA: What?
###403 I want that.
###405 FELICIA: No but look, I just thought it was appropriate for
###407 Vaginal Fantasy.
###408 BONNIE: Is that Magnum P.I. on it?
###409 FELICIA: Look at the label.
###410 There's a guy and a girl making out.
###412 There's her booty.
###413 There's a guy.
###414 KIALA: That is a monkey.
###415 BONNIE: That's a monkey.
###415 KIALA: That is a monkey.
###416 FELICIA: No, it's a lady.
###417 BONNIE: It's a monkey holding a coconut on a skateboard.
###420 FELICIA: No, it's a chick with some boobs, coconut boobs.
###423 BONNIE: This is the worst workshop test ever.
###425 VERONICA: I've got a lovely bunch of
###426 coconuts, do do do do.
###428 FELICIA: No, no.
###428 It doesn't look good.
###429 It's gotten vigorton on it.
###430 VERONICA: That's what my mom got me for Christmas.
###431 KIALA: It sounds Australian.
###432 BONNIE: Wait, what?
###433 What's that?
###433 VERONICA: My mom got me this for Christmas.
###435 BONNIE: Is that two guys making out?
###437 FELICIA: Oh no.
###438 What is that?
###439 KIALA: Modernism and the Women's
###441 Popular Romance in Britain.
###442 I read that for everyone.
###444 Because I read.
###444 VERONICA: Thank you.
###445 BONNIE: Thanks for reading aloud, thank you.
###446 VERONICA: And I think that looks like Matthew McConaughey
###447 on the cover.
###448 KIALA: It does.
###450 And Myrna Loy.
###452 Myrna Loy and Matthew McConaughey.
###454 BONNIE: We're in the French [INAUDIBLE].
###456 The French [INAUDIBLE].
###457 VERONICA: By Martin Hipsky.
###458 I'm going to read it.
###459 It's going to be pretty cool.
###462 FELICIA: That's really cool.
###462 OK.
###463 So I guess we should get on with the show.
###467 BONNIE: Which one are we talking about first?
###468 FELICIA: Well, I want to give a shout out
###470 to the local meetup.
###471 The local meetups.
###473 We had a bunch of meetups this month.
###475 And there's some people who are getting together in
###477 various places in January to talk about this month's book.
###480 In New York City a group met at Argo Tea.
###483 In Orange County a bunch of people met at the Disney's
###486 Grand Californian hotel.
###488 In Portland people met at Lucky Lab.
###491 Washington D.C. had a meet up at the Portrait museum.
###494 And upcoming ones, North Hollywood is meeting on the
###497 sixth to discuss the books we're talking about now at the
###501 SteamPunk Cafe.
###502 The Twin Cities is having a meetup.
###504 Atlanta is putting together a meetup.
###506 And there's one in Chicago.
###507 So if you want to make your own meetup you just go to the
###511 Goodreads Group and there is a thread for local meetups and
###515 they're actually really fun.
###516 So there tend to be a bunch every month that everybody
###519 gets together to do.
###520 So yes.
###521 The book this month is called Succubus Blues.
###524 And I will give you a short description.
###527 "When it comes to jobs in hell, being a succubus seems
###530 pretty glamorous.
###530 A girl can be anything she wants.
###532 The wardrobe is killer, and the mortal men will do
###534 anything just for a touch.
###535 But Seattle succubus Georgina Kincaid's
###539 life is far from exotic.
###541 She works at a local bookstore and she has easy access to the
###544 sexy writer Seth Mortensen but there's something wicked going
###549 on in Seattle's demon underground." So that is by
###553 Richelle Mead.
###554 That was the book we all read this month.
###555 And what did we think about it?
###558 BONNIE: I liked it.
###560 FELICIA: And why?
###562 
###563 BONNIE: The end.
###566 FELICIA: Thank you for joining Vaginal Fantasy with me.
###568 VERONICA: I liked it.
###569 BONNIE: I told you that I read all the comments and they said
###572 I needed to not talk so much.
###573 So that's it.
###574 FELICIA: Never read the comments Bonnie.
###576 BONNIE: I know, but I have to.
###577 VERONICA: There's a Twitter account called "Don't Read
###579 Comments," and all it is a daily
###581 reminder to not read comments.
###583 BONNIE: As one of the hosts it's our obligation to answer
###587 questions in the comments too.
###588 VERONICA: Yeah.
###589 I get it.
###590 BONNIE: I liked it because weirdly enough I super
###593 identified with the main character because I drink
###597 three mochas a day and I talk to my pet.
###600 And I crush on authors.
###603 And I've had author encounters where I was a total idiot
###606 because I didn't know who they were.
###609 And, yeah.
###611 There's just a lot of things.
###612 Other than the fact that I can't shapeshift into hot
###615 chicks with horns yet, I really identified with her.
###621 I liked her.
###621 And I liked the writing style in this book.
###623 It was really easy to get into.
###626 There wasn't a lot of hardcore sexy times enough.
###630 But I just liked the writing style and I liked all the
###633 characters.
###634 And I could picture it as a TV show or a movie really, really
###638 fast and easily.
###639 
###642 I read the book quickly because I didn't
###644 want to put it down.
###645 Which is funny because the main character, Georgina in
###648 the book, she talks about how she reads books slowly because
###651 she really wants that first time she reads a good book to
###654 last a long time, which I've done that too.
###658 I didn't do that with this book.
###659 I just read it really quick.
###660 It was really good.
###661 I liked it.
###663 FELICIA: It's funny that you say that about a TV show
###665 because there is a Canadian show called Lost
###667 Girl about a succubus.
###669 And I think it's on Syfy channel right now.
###671 I've always wanted to marathon it.
###674 BONNIE: It's good.
###674 FELICIA: But a lot of people, especially on Twitter, are
###678 really big fans of it.
###679 So I'm going to definitely check it out.
###680 And then someone said this book was optioned to be a TV
###682 show last year.
###683 So you never know.
###685 VERONICA: That almost never means anything unfortunately.
###689 FELICIA: Kiala, what did you think of the book?
###691 KIALA: I really liked it.
###692 I thought that there was some kind of cliche, sloppy writing
###697 bits, but overall I really liked it.
###700 And I liked her crushing on an author, because I've gone
###706 through that exact same thing.
###707 In fact, one time Dan Kennedy, he's one of my favorite
###712 writers from McSweeney's.
###714 Yeah, from Moth.
###715 And he was coming here to read at Powell's and I have friends
###718 who work there and they know him very well.
###720 And I thought that I was going to get a chance to meet him,
###722 we were going to go out afterwards.
###723 But I wasn't sure that was going to happen.
###725 It was all kind of new.
###726 And I had written a blog post on my personal blog about how
###729 I wanted him to look at me and tell me we were going to run
###731 away together and he was going to take away from all this
###733 filth and poverty.
###735 And so we we all did end up going out after his reading.
###738 And then they told him about my blog post and he pulled out
###741 his iPhone and he read it aloud to me.
###744 VERONICA: Oh my God, that was embarrassing.
###746 That's like a Moth episode.
###748 That's basically a Moth episode.
###750 BONNIE: Nice.
###751 KIALA: And then at the end of the night he shook my hand and
###754 he looked down at me and he said, "I'm going to take you
###755 away from all this filth and poverty." And it
###758 was the best thing.
###760 VERONICA: But then he didn't.
###760 BONNIE: Obviously he didn't.
###762 VERONICA: He didn't.
###762 FELICIA: He's a liar.
###764 KIALA: He's a liar.
###765 VERONICA: He's a liar.
###766 KIALA: Anyway, so that, I really identified with that.
###769 And I actually enjoyed the story a lot.
###773 And I was surprised at the end.
###776 I thought I knew what was going to happen and I didn't
###778 know what was going to happen.
###780 FELICIA: That's interesting.
###781 OK, Veronica, you look a little skeptical.
###783 What do you think?
###784 VERONICA: No, I loved it.
###785 I thought it was fun.
###786 I thought it was a really great book.
###787 I had a great time reading it.
###788 Georgina as a character I think was probably one of the
###791 more relatable characters we've read in
###793 a really long time.
###794 I could picture everything in her life so exactly.
###798 It's one of the first books where I was almost picturing
###801 myself as her, except obviously not as hot because
###803 she's super hot.
###804 But at the bookstore--
###805 FELICIA: You're super hot.
###806 BONNIE: You're super hot.
###807 Come on.
###808 VERONICA: But at the bookstore I was picturing my hometown
###810 Barnes and Noble and there was this little metaphysical store
###813 that I used to go to when I was a teenager in my town.
###815 I was picturing that as the place she went to
###817 go talk with Eric.
###819 Or whatever his name was.
###820 And just the clubs I used to go to in Boston is where she
###824 got trashed that night that they were playing the show and
###827 she went and made out with him near the bathroom.
###829 So all of that stuff for some reason, it was like maybe it
###831 was because it was modern times and she was really
###834 living more in the regular world than any other kind of
###839 fantastical kind of world.
###841 It was just really easy to relate to her.
###842 And I knew one of the two love interests was going to be the
###847 trouble at the end.
###848 I knew it was one of them.
###850 I just couldn't really figure out who it was until right up
###852 when it happened.
###853 And then I thought that the sister being the other, the
###857 sister being the bitch from the other
###859 bookstore, that was fun.
###862 That was a fun little twist.
###864 So it all came together really, really
###866 nicely in the end.
###868 And I liked her very much as a character.
###870 So I thought this was a series I would
###872 like to continue reading.
###873 FELICIA: Yeah, I definitely want to pick up the next one.
###874 By the way, your not being sexy.
###876 Somebody just sent a comment, said they want to
###878 put a baby in you.
###879 So come on.
###880 KIALA: Baby [INAUDIBLE].
###883 VERONICA: I've got a puppy, that's enough to deal with.
###884 No babies.
###886 One thing keeping me up at night is all I need right now.
###889 FELICIA: Oh my gosh.
###891 I agree with everybody here.
###893 I actually was a fan of this author from her other series
###897 which I can't remember the name of it.
###899 It's about a shaman or, I don't want to
###904 talk about that series.
###905 But it was a very enjoyable series too.
###907 So I'd never read this one.
###908 And I think this was one of her first books.
###911 She also has a very popular series called
###913 Vampire Academy, I think.
###915 VERONICA: I've hear of that, yeah.
###916 FELICIA: Yeah it's a teen series, which I don't really
###919 read a lot of teen series.
###920 VERONICA: That's out on Penguin, isn't it?
###921 That's Penguin.
###922 FELICIA: Yeah I think so.
###924 BONNIE: How is that not a TV show?
###925 That sounds like that should be a TV show.
###927 FELICIA: I think everything gets optioned and then it just
###929 never gets made.
###929 That's just TV for you.
###932 But I really liked the characters.
###934 I agree.
###934 I definitely wanted to live her life.
###937 It was very relatable and grounded.
###939 The only thing I kept wondering was like, she wasn't
###942 a succubus very often.
###943 So there was never a lot of conflict with her succubus
###946 needs or job.
###948 There was not a lot of pressure on her to fulfill the
###952 succubus need.
###953 And she's been a succubus for 1,000 years or hundreds of
###955 years or whatever, it felt like she would have had more
###958 of a job there.
###959 But if you suspend your disbelief there I loved all
###963 the characters around her.
###964 I've fanned on so many authors.
###967 That's my trigger point.
###968 I don't care about actors.
###969 But I actually sent a tweet to Graham Linehan who does IT
###973 Crowd because I've been obsessed with him.
###976 BONNIE: And he also does Black Books and Father Ted.
###979 FELICIA: Oh I know, I watched all of them.
###981 KIALA: I love Black Books.
###983 FELICIA: Yeah, Black Books is amazing.
###984 And I have Father Ted.
###986 It just got here.
###987 Every single episode.
###989 So I tweeted to him and he actually responded to me, and
###991 I literally started sweating everywhere.
###993 
###996 BONNIE: He's pretty awesome.
###998 He's Glinner on Twitter in case any of you
###1000 want to follow him.
###1001 FELICIA: And it's really funny too because now I follow him
###1003 in a creepy way.
###1004 BONNIE: He followed me for a little while until he realized
###1006 how much I tweeted him and he wised up and unfollowed me
###1008 which is totally fine.
###1010 KIALA: That happened to me with William Gibson.
###1012 BONNIE: Yeah, me too.
###1014 FELICIA: What, he followed and unfollowed you?
###1015 KIALA: Yeah he followed me for two years.
###1018 And I was afraid to look.
###1020 And then finally I looked one day and he was not following
###1022 me anymore.
###1022 And I'm like, oh my God, no.
###1024 VERONICA: That's the worst thing.
###1024 Do you guys have people who you do that?
###1026 You check every so often to see if
###1028 they're still following?
###1028 And you're like, oh my God, I don't want to click because I
###1030 don't want to know.
###1031 I don't want to click.
###1031 I don't want to know.
###1034 BONNIE: I do that all the time.
###1036 There's a site called Who Unfollowed Me.
###1039 VERONICA: Why would you ever look at that?
###1041 FELICIA: No, Bonnie.
###1041 VERONICA: What is wrong with you?
###1042 KIALA: You're a masochist.
###1045 BONNIE: I just look at it because sometimes I follow
###1047 people just as a favor.
###1049 And then if they're not following me anymore I
###1051 unfollow them.
###1052 I do that.
###1052 Or just like magazines or TV shows that have been canceled
###1055 or whatever.
###1056 And then I looked at it the other day and two friends I
###1059 really thought I was close with unfollowed me.
###1062 And I'm like, OK.
###1063 I'm not going to take it personal.
###1064 And then two celebrities that I sort of pseudo stalked
###1067 unfollowed me.
###1068 And then I remember Noel Fielding from Mighty Boosh
###1071 followed me for five minutes and it was the best five
###1074 minutes of my life.
###1076 And I think I DM'd him something really horrible
###1079 like, hey, do you want me to send you a [INAUDIBLE]?
###1081 VERONICA: Oh, you shouldn't DM people ever.
###1085 KIALA: I drunk DM'd Clive Barker.
###1087 
###1091 He still follows me though.
###1093 BONNIE: [INAUDIBLE] at us.
###1094 [INAUDIBLE]
###1095 because remember we said that I said that I didn't think
###1098 there were sexy times in his books and he got all freaked
###1100 out and he tweeted at us that there was.
###1103 VERONICA: Really?
###1104 BONNIE: Yeah.
###1106 VERONICA: Well I had the best finding out of someone
###1110 following me ever in my life a couple of weeks ago.
###1113 And I'm scared to even say it out loud because I don't want
###1115 him to unfollow me.
###1116 Andrew W.K. I nearly pooped a brick.
###1122 Because I love Andrew W.K. He's one of my favorite
###1126 musicians and I used to go to his shows all the time.
###1128 And he's so party positive.
###1131 And I tweeted something about--
###1132 what did I tweet about?
###1133 Oh, it was a long story.
###1135 But he tweeted back at me and I was like, oh my God.
###1138 What?
###1138 Where?
###1140 What's happening right now?
###1142 BONNIE: This is why I love Twitter.
###1144 Because I think it was yesterday I was tweeting with
###1148 some people that were all watching Starship Troopers.
###1151 And we're tweeting at each other.
###1152 And it was all girls tweeting at each other.
###1154 And then Casper Van Dien who's in the movie tweeted at us.
###1157 And we all started tweeting each other Starship Trooper
###1161 stuff and totally fangirl like.
###1163 I'm like, what the hell?
###1164 This is awesome.
###1165 VERONICA: That's amazing.
###1166 BONNIE: That's why I love Twitter, is because I think
###1168 it's great that both actors and authors get a chance to
###1173 freak out their fans.
###1175 FELICIA: And you can interact with people and you don't have
###1177 all these preconceived notions of who you are.
###1180 BONNIE: Which is funny because in the book, in the succubus
###1182 book that we read, the very--
###1184 KIALA: Oh, we read a book?
###1185 FELICIA: Oh yeah, that thing?
###1186 KIALA: That show we're supposed to be having?
###1188 BONNIE: No, this is all relevant.
###1189 This is all relevant.
###1190 Because he doesn't know what her favorite
###1193 author looks like.
###1194 Which I find that hard to believe because when I have a
###1197 favorite author I stalk them like crazy.
###1199 KIALA: Use Google Image immediately.
###1201 BONNIE: Yeah I know everything about them.
###1203 I know their eye color and their cat's name and what they
###1205 eat for breakfast.
###1205 I am down with this.
###1207 And so when she's like, I don't know who this author is,
###1210 as an author sometimes I have that fantasy of I have this
###1214 revolving fantasy in my brain that Benedict Cumberbatch is
###1217 going to meet me at a party and it's going to be at my
###1218 book signing party and he doesn't know what I look like.
###1221 And he's going to be like, I really love this author.
###1223 And I'll be like, oh really?
###1224 Tell me more.
###1225 FELICIA: Wow, this sounds like a beginning
###1227 to a bad porn, Bonnie.
###1229 BONNIE: You know this is sad.
###1230 Since I only write non-fiction kid books I doubt I'd have a
###1233 book party where Benedict would show up.
###1235 FELICIA: You don't know.
###1236 KIALA: Unless he has a kid.
###1239 VERONICA: And then it might be too late.
###1240 BONNIE: It's never too late.
###1241 VERONICA: Never too late.
###1242 FELICIA: OK.
###1243 A lot of people [INAUDIBLE].
###1244 
###1246 BONNIE: OK go ahead, go ahead.
###1247 FELICIA: You didn't ruin his marriage, you just forgot it.
###1250 KIALA: Sorry.
###1252 FELICIA: Wow.
###1252 OK.
###1253 People on the forums really liked the book.
###1255 Camille who's one of our oldest forum members said, the
###1258 book has some of the greatest quotes I've ever found in some
###1261 of these books.
###1262 And he's the one who posted that it got bought, the rights
###1267 got optioned.
###1268 The only negative thing, a lot of people basically said the
###1273 ending, they could tell in advance that Roman was going
###1279 to be the bad guy.
###1280 VERONICA: Oh, well aren't you guys smart.
###1282 
###1285 BONNIE: Didn't you know?
###1286 Couldn't you tell from the fact that he couldn't put a
###1288 bookcase together?
###1290 VERONICA: What?
###1291 FELICIA: What?
###1291 BONNIE: Remember in the beginning in which he comes
###1294 over to help her put her bookcase together, and he lied
###1297 about knowing about how to put--
###1299 why am I the only one that remembers this?
###1301 FELICIA: I do remember that he was pretty sweet.
###1303 KIALA: No, I remember that but--
###1304 BONNIE: No, I know, but I just made a joke that bad guys
###1307 can't put Ikea furniture together.
###1310 FELICIA: Oh, is that a known thing?
###1312 BONNIE: No, I just made it up.
###1314 I don't know.
###1314 I tried to be funny, this isn't working.
###1317 Kiala, what did you think?
###1318 VERONICA: Drink more.
###1322 KIALA: I was pretty sure that it was Roman but then I
###1324 thought that was too obvious.
###1325 And then actually for a while I thought that maybe Seth was
###1331 a shape shifter and I thought he and Roman
###1334 were the same person.
###1335 
###1337 But then they were at the same place at the same time and
###1340 then I realized that wasn't true.
###1342 BONNIE: That would be cool though.
###1343 FELICIA: Melissa had a really good point on the forum.
###1346 She said she really got into the book in the last half.
###1349 Which I agree, it definitely picks up in the last half
###1351 after the whole plot, the Nephilim plot gets started.
###1355 But it was weird, she got into it after Carter and wanted
###1359 Carter to get together with Georgina, which I wanted too.
###1361 KIALA: Me too.
###1362 FELICIA: Carter the angel.
###1363 KIALA: Yes, he was so sweet and strong.
###1365 And I kept picturing him as Misha Collins from
###1370 Supernatural.
###1371 BONNIE: Supernatural, I did that too.
###1373 The minute they described him I'm like, oh, Misha Collins.
###1375 KIALA: I was like, oh, it's Cass.
###1377 FELICIA: Yeah, because he was like the sexy,
###1379 understanding angel guy.
###1381 He's kind of like Cass.
###1384 KIALA: I pictured him like that kind of personality wise.
###1386 But honestly picturing him, I pictured him as Eric Northman.
###1390 VERONICA: Really?
###1391 That seems a little large for me.
###1394 FELICIA: Really?
###1395 VERONICA: Maybe a little bit too big.
###1395 KIALA: Because he was like a big angel,
###1397 like tall and angely.
###1399 BONNIE: Angely.
###1401 VERONICA: See my problem is I never picture people in books
###1403 as people from the real world.
###1405 They always form into their own things.
###1408 It's why I have a really hard time
###1409 with the casting questions.
###1410 BONNIE: So I started a Pinterest board called Sexy
###1413 Lads, so if any of you follow me on Pinterest.
###1416 And that's where I put all my casting picks.
###1419 FELICIA: I don't know how I feel about that.
###1421 Is that objectification?
###1422 Like if a guy did that about girls would I be offended?
###1425 BONNIE: I do it with girls too though.
###1427 When we think about what actresses should play the
###1431 parts in the books we read, I do this with actresses too.
###1434 I just haven't made a Pinterest board yet.
###1435 I will.
###1436 FELICIA: I had an equal opportunity objectification.
###1439 BONNIE: It'll probably just be mostly Eva Green but yeah,
###1442 I'll do it.
###1443 FELICIA: Eva Green is who I thought of Georgina for.
###1445 BONNIE: Yeah I know, me too.
###1448 KIALA: I had a Pinterest porn board for a short period of
###1451 time because I thought it was funny.
###1453 VERONICA: Did they take it down?
###1454 Did they make you take it down?
###1455 KIALA: No, I took it down.
###1457 BONNIE: Is it still there?
###1457 KIALA: No, I took it down.
###1459 I couldn't bring myself to pin anything.
###1461 
###1463 FELICIA: Is it like an empty porn board?
###1466 BONNIE: That's like my life.
###1468 My life is an empty porn board.
###1470 FELICIA: Oh God, Bonnie.
###1472 BONNIE: Sorry, apology to [INAUDIBLE].
###1475 I'll drink more.
###1475 Let's talk about the book, yay.
###1477 FELICIA: OK let's talk the characters.
###1479 Georgina.
###1480 Sam on the forums loved the main character, although I
###1483 expected her to do more supernatural things.
###1486 She didn't seem to have any female friends which I thought
###1489 was interesting.
###1490 And then he wants to know, is that standard for a succubus
###1492 or was a function of her being a succubus?
###1496 What did you guys think?
###1498 She had a couple of female coworkers that were
###1500 friends with her.
###1501 VERONICA: They weren't friendly.
###1502 Yeah they weren't central characters at all.
###1504 BONNIE: She didn't have a sassy galpal.
###1507 VERONICA: Yeah the only other major female character was
###1510 antagonistic towards her.
###1511 FELICIA: Yeah, that's interesting.
###1512 Do you think that's because she was--
###1516 KIALA: So overtly sexual?
###1517 FELICIA: Yeah because you'd think it
###1518 would be the opposite.
###1519 Like she'd have more female friends because her only
###1521 function is to use her sexuality to feed.
###1526 VERONICA: So maybe she just doesn't drawn women like that.
###1527 BONNIE: She could have attracted more lesbians, I
###1529 don't know.
###1530 
###1533 FELICIA: Also there was actually a big thread on the
###1536 forums about evil as good.
###1538 Some people, Jude I think, started that thread about how
###1543 they felt uncomfortable with the sympathet-- thetification?
###1547 Is that a word?
###1547 It's not.
###1548 Let me drink more.
###1550 Making evil characters more sympathetic.
###1553 Because basically her function on earth is to corrupt people.
###1557 VERONICA: But that's silly.
###1559 Because there's so many amazing characters from so
###1561 many different stories.
###1564 They're supposed to be evil but they're more
###1566 complicated than that.
###1570 KIALA: Or like Battlestar Galactica and all the Cylons.
###1572 VERONICA: That's just the whole point.
###1573 You have to have a complicated character.
###1575 You have to have a character with a lot of dimensions.
###1576 And just because they have an evil job to do or what is
###1581 assumed to be an evil job, I guess it is an evil job.
###1586 Bringing their souls into hell, I guess it's that's
###1588 [INAUDIBLE].
###1588 FELICIA: Actually she didn't do a lot of it.
###1590 But if she actually did more of it, you probably wouldn't
###1592 have liked her as much.
###1595 BONNIE: Let's be honest.
###1596 It's not like she did it.
###1597 She basically played on people's
###1600 cravings and interests.
###1602 KIALA: Yeah they wanted it.
###1604 BONNIE: It's ultimately your decision whether or not you
###1606 want your soul to go to heaven or hell in this book.
###1609 If you just choose to give it up to have sex with a hot
###1611 chick then that's--
###1612 VERONICA: She's an enabler.
###1613 She's an enabler and that's what it comes down to.
###1615 KIALA: I didn't like that stupid characterization at the
###1618 beginning of that it was a geeky dude living in his
###1622 parent's basement.
###1622 He was a 34 year old virgin with Cheeto fingers.
###1625 
###1628 BONNIE: Cheeto fingers are hot.
###1629 
###1631 VERONICA: You can lick it off.
###1632 Like aah.
###1635 KIALA: It was so annoying.
###1636 
###1640 Things like that were annoying.
###1641 BONNIE: Veronica, you're going to be an animated gif of
###1643 licking your fingers before you know it.
###1645 VERONICA: Oh God.
###1647 It's too late It's already happened.
###1648 It already exists.
###1648 KIALA: Yeah, it's on now already.
###1651 I didn't like that.
###1653 I didn't like a lot of her textbook psychologically
###1659 damaged, in your face sexuality, like she only could
###1665 identify with people that were sexually attracted to her.
###1670 Like every single man, every single character in that book
###1674 was somebody that she only related to sexually.
###1677 Well other than her gay vampire best friends.
###1680 FELICIA: Yeah that's true.
###1681 But also I thought it was kind of convenient and total wish
###1685 fulfillment when she could change her appearance and all
###1687 her clothing instantly.
###1689 It was so convenient.
###1690 KIALA: It's like a fantasy.
###1690 Like a lady fantasy.
###1692 FELICIA: It was such a lady fantasy which
###1693 I was jealous of.
###1694 She never has to spend any money on clothing.
###1696 
###1698 BONNIE: That reminded me a little of Tonks in Harry
###1700 Potter because she could change her hair at any point.
###1703 And I'm like, I've dyed my hair a lot of times.
###1705 And if I could just change my hair without it turning into
###1707 like, horrible over dried wet noodle situation I would do
###1711 that in a heartbeat.
###1712 VERONICA: By the way, your hair looks great today Bonnie.
###1714 KIALA: It does.
###1715 BONNIE: If you follow me on Pinterest, you might notice
###1717 that I had might dye it soon.
###1720 FELICIA: [GASP]
###1720 What color?
###1722 BONNIE: Violet.
###1722 VERONICA: Red?
###1723 BONNIE: Violet.
###1724 Violet.
###1724 KIALA: Violet, oh.
###1726 FELICIA: I like this.
###1727 Veronica I don't have bangs anymore.
###1728 BONNIE: I know, what happened to them bangs?
###1730 FELICIA: I'm going to get them trimmed.
###1731 It's just, I don't know.
###1732 It was too traumatic last time, looking too much.
###1735 BONNIE: Why?
###1736 You know who I thought you looked like?
###1738 You actually look like Amy Pond.
###1742 FELICIA: With the bangs?
###1743 BONNIE: Yeah.
###1744 FELICIA: I like that.
###1745 BONNIE: That's a compliment.
###1746 FELICIA: I mean, I'm going to get them trimmed.
###1748 I just feel like I'm in the presence of
###1751 the mistress of bangs.
###1753 And to be a pale imitation of bangs.
###1755 Do you cut your own bangs?
###1757 VERONICA: I do.
###1758 KIALA: Really?
###1759 VERONICA: I do.
###1759 Well I get my hair cut once every month and a half, but
###1762 then for touch ups I do my own.
###1764 FELICIA: Yeah that's what I need to do.
###1765 I didn't know that I was in for maintenance.
###1769 BONNIE: I cut my bangs.
###1770 I have to cut my bangs straight every
###1772 two weeks or so.
###1773 VERONICA: Yeah.
###1773 It's a pain.
###1774 It's a pain in the butt, but it's worth it.
###1776 BONNIE: You get used to it.
###1777 KIALA: I was going to say just on that Lady Fantasy thing,
###1779 there's a series of--
###1780 I can't remember who writes them-- but a series of novels
###1783 where the woman, she discovers she's got this magic, and
###1789 every time she uses it, it expends so much energy she has
###1792 to eat and eat and eat.
###1794 It also made her really young and beautiful.
###1796 And then she has to eat all the time and she can't gain
###1799 any weight.
###1800 Whereas before, she would gain weight all the time.
###1803 BONNIE: Does she have to eat a certain thing?
###1806 KIALA: She just has to eat a lot of food.
###1807 Just binge eat.
###1809 But she can't keep weight on.
###1811 And it's kind of messed up.
###1814 But that was just my feeling about it.
###1818 FELICIA: Silvy Marie on the forums mentioned her sleeping
###1821 with Warren and she was very upset.
###1824 She went to somebody she knows to get a fix but she didn't
###1828 really need it.
###1828 And she lost respect for her then.
###1831 BONNIE: I didn't like Warren.
###1832 FELICIA: I didn't like Warren either but I though, I didn't
###1835 like her then, but then I liked the fact that
###1837 I didn't like her.
###1838 In that it made more three dimensional.
###1839 You don't have to be perfect.
###1840 A lot of these books that we read and the ones that I don't
###1843 even list on my good reads, I can't engage with them.
###1847 Because the person is so perfect you just feel like
###1850 she's a martyr.
###1852 OK, just mess up once please?
###1854 Because you read about a person, it doesn't feel real.
###1856 So that's why I kind of liked her, knowing that she was
###1859 making a bad decision but just indulging herself with Warren.
###1862 VERONICA: Do you think it was on purpose that they chose one
###1864 of the most unlikable characters?
###1866 That she made Warren really unlikable in order for us to
###1869 not feel so bad about Georgina sleeping with him to get some
###1872 powers back?
###1874 FELICIA: I think so.
###1875 Well also you don't want to muddy the waters because if he
###1877 was sympathetic then what's going on with
###1880 Seth and then Roman?
###1881 It would just muddy everything up.
###1883 Like I said, I wanted her to get with Carter.
###1886 VERONICA: That wouldn't give her any power.
###1888 Because he's also supernatural.
###1890 FELICIA: Oh, that's true.
###1892 VERONICA: What about her little friend?
###1896 The guy that worked at the store with her?
###1897 KIALA: Doug.
###1898 VERONICA: Doug, yeah.
###1899 Like if she ends up with Doug, that would
###1902 have been like, whoa.
###1903 He's a super nice guy and he really likes you and now
###1905 you're using him.
###1906 But with Warren it's like they mutually use each other.
###1910 FELICIA: Exactly.
###1912 BONNIE: I don't want to get too personal here, but usually
###1913 when you have a you-know-what buddy--
###1916 I can't swear on this channel, but you know what I mean--
###1919 if you have a sexy times buddy, chances are that sexy
###1923 times buddy isn't the most redeemable of people.
###1926 Because they're using you as much as you're using them.
###1930 I don't know, I'm just saying.
###1933 FELICIA: I don't know about it.
###1934 BONNIE: Fits the profile of the douchebag that--
###1937 KIALA: I haven't had one, but it's not a moral reason.
###1941 I just have never had one.
###1943 BONNIE: Wow.
###1943 Am I the only one who's had one?
###1945 Many?
###1946 A few?
###1948 FELICIA: Anyway.
###1949 Talk about Seth who was one of the main love interests.
###1952 A lot of people really liked Seth because he was classified
###1957 as a beta male.
###1958 Which we all, in a lot of these Vaginal Fantasy book
###1962 club picks have had very dominating men
###1965 who are very pushy.
###1966 And the girl's like, no, no, no.
###1968 OK fine.
###1968 I like you.
###1969 And that's become the archetype of the romance hero.
###1974 Seth is kind of the opposite of that.
###1975 He's actually very shy and the main character doesn't know
###1978 what to do with him.
###1978 And a lot of people loved him.
###1980 Stacey, I loved the emails that he sent to her.
###1983 And what did you guys think about him as the hero?
###1987 BONNIE: Isn't that frustrating though?
###1988 Isn't that kind of frustrating to have a guy that's really
###1991 good at writing emails but when you're face to face can't
###1994 hold a decent conversation with you?
###1996 KIALA: Yeah.
###1997 I know one guy like that.
###1999 And it's really annoying.
###2001 BONNIE: It's annoying.
###2002 Yeah.
###2002 FELICIA: I had a boyfriend in high school that gave really
###2006 good phone.
###2007 He had a great voice, but then when you met him in person it
###2009 was like, this is weird.
###2012 VERONICA: Not the same.
###2012 Not the same.
###2014 I've had a lot of IM boyfriends like that.
###2017 They're really good over IM, and then in person it's just
###2020 like, you're weird.
###2021 KIALA: Yeah.
###2022 Or the opposite where they're really great in person but
###2025 then they misspell everything in texts.
###2028 Or too many emoticons.
###2031 And you're like, oh God, no.
###2032 VERONICA: It's like a smiley face after every sentence.
###2034 KIALA: Yeah lol.
###2037 BONNIE: Have you ever broken off anything with someone
###2039 because they kept using the wrong "there?"
###2041 KIALA: I would.
###2043 FELICIA: I would, yeah.
###2043 KIALA: If they didn't correct themselves, or the wrong
###2045 "your."
###2046 BONNIE: Like over.
###2046 And once or twice is fine, but all the time.
###2049 And mixing up "your" with "you're."
###2052 VERONICA: I don't understand internet speak sometimes.
###2055 BONNIE: Really?
###2055 VERONICA: Like, I get it.
###2056 I get it.
###2057 I just don't understand why it's so prevalent.
###2060 FELICIA: Because everybody does it.
###2061 KIALA: [INAUDIBLE].
###2062 VERONICA: No, no.
###2063 Not like lol, meme speak.
###2065 That's different.
###2066 BONNIE: I still don't know what the hell "YOLO" is.
###2070 VERONICA: You only live once.
###2071 You only live once.
###2072 BONNIE: Really?
###2073 VERONICA: I'm going to go ride on the top of my car, YOLO.
###2078 I'm going to ghostride the whip, YOLO.
###2080 
###2083 I'm going to go put a badger in my pants, YOLO.
###2085 
###2088 FELICIA: Badger?
###2088 Where did that come from?
###2090 KIALA: I still don't--
###2091 SMH?
###2091 I can never remember what-- it's So Much Hate, right?
###2094 VERONICA: Oh is that what that means?
###2095 BONNIE: Is that what that is?
###2096 FELICIA: I wouldn't know that one either.
###2097 KIALA: I don't know.
###2098 I think that's it.
###2100 VERONICA: TLDR is one of my favorites.
###2102 BONNIE: What's that one?
###2103 VERONICA: Too Long, Didn't Read.
###2104 FELICIA: That's the most insulting one.
###2106 Just put some effort in or don't join the
###2108 conversation, please.
###2109 VERONICA: No, you want to know what the most insulting
###2110 hashtag of all time is?
###2112 BONNIE: What?
###2113 VERONICA: First World Problems.
###2115 People respond to me and now this is going to happen all
###2118 the time because I'm saying it.
###2120 FELICIA: I'm going to do it now.
###2121 VERONICA: It's a first world problem that I'm complaining
###2122 about first world problems in hashtag.
###2124 BONNIE: Start the #vaginalproblems.
###2126 FELICIA: First world problems is having a
###2127 Twitter account, OK?
###2130 VERONICA: It's like, it's redundant, we know, we know.
###2133 Everything I complain about on here is a first world problem.
###2136 Let's just put that out there.
###2138 BONNIE: Maybe we should do succubus problem.
###2140 VERONICA: Succubus problem.
###2141 FELICIA: Oh, succubus problem.
###2143 BONNIE: Let's do that as a hashtag.
###2144 Hey, have we trended yet?
###2145 I still think Vaginal Fantasy needs to trend today.
###2148 If everyone's watching this, tweet it so it trends.
###2151 Because I don't want people to be confused because it's a
###2153 football Sunday.
###2154 KIALA: Yeah it's Sunday, there's nothing else going on.
###2156 Come on.
###2157 FELICIA: There's so much sportsball talk on there.
###2158 I just don't even check on Sundays.
###2162 BONNIE: No, it's either Sunday used to be just football or
###2163 Walking Dead, right?
###2164 That's basically all Sundays were.
###2166 FELICIA: And awards shows.
###2168 BONNIE: Right.
###2169 VERONICA: I try not to get mad at the football talk because
###2171 once spring and summer rolls around it's
###2172 baseball talk for me.
###2173 So I have to let the football talk happen.
###2176 BONNIE: See, I'm all about soccer talk.
###2178 VERONICA: Soccer talk.
###2179 That's like early in the morning, that's like 6 AM.
###2182 I used to live above a bar that played all of the
###2186 international soccer games, football games.
###2188 BONNIE: Was it Mad Dog?
###2189 VERONICA: It was Mad Dog.
###2190 It was Mad Dog.
###2191 And I don't live there anymore so don't go there.
###2194 BONNIE: I was downstairs.
###2195 While you were asleep I was down at Mad Dog trying to hit
###2198 on every British football fan in the bar at 6 in the
###2201 morning, and I was not doing a good job.
###2203 VERONICA: Oh so you mean while you guys were screaming at the
###2205 top of your lungs at football games at 6
###2207 o'clock in the morning?
###2208 BONNIE: I have no idea and I don't even know
###2209 how they play it.
###2210 I just go for the short shorts and the accents.
###2212 I'm shallow.
###2213 KIALA: Is Mad Dog the one that's right next to
###2216 Rosamunde's?
###2217 VERONICA: Yeah across the street.
###2220 Toronado's right next door.
###2221 BONNIE: So if you're in San Francisco, go to Mad Dog in
###2222 the Fog and you can early in the morning watch.
###2225 VERONICA: It's like a weird DJ bar now.
###2227 It got too hip.
###2229 They redid it and it's not as good.
###2231 But we are way off.
###2232 
###2235 FELICIA: If somebody's grading us they can go to hell.
###2239 BONNIE: Can we do the casting now?
###2241 Because I had ideas of who's what.
###2243 FELICIA: Well I did want to talk about one last thing
###2245 [INAUDIBLE] in Roman, the other love interest guy who is
###2250 the opposite of Seth.
###2251 He was extremely pushy, he wouldn't take no for an
###2253 answer, and he ends up being the bad guy.
###2255 And a lot of people, Erin on the forums said, I hate Roman,
###2259 I'm halfway through.
###2260 And that was before she even knew he was a bad guy.
###2263 And the creepy way that Roman treated people
###2265 sent me crazy vibes.
###2266 They seemed stalkery and rapery, or was he charming?
###2268 Was the persistence creepy to anyone else?
###2272 VERONICA: It was a little creepy at first.
###2273 Well, actually it was creepy the whole time.
###2276 I thought Roman was a little bit creepy.
###2278 He came on a little bit too strong.
###2279 KIALA: Yeah I didn't like that he walked her home from the
###2281 bar because you shouldn't ever do that.
###2284 FELICIA: She never should have had him walk you home.
###2285 KIALA: No.
###2286 VERONICA: Stranger danger.
###2287 KIALA: You get right in a cab.
###2288 No.
###2289 BONNIE: She can take care of herself though.
###2291 I mean, I don't know.
###2292 She's the one that pointed him out though.
###2294 She's the one that started all this mess because she's been
###2297 trying to tell everyone she had a date, which she didn't.
###2299 VERONICA: But he could have played it cool.
###2301 I mean, he played it cool at the time.
###2302 But he could've been like, OK.
###2304 Having fun.
###2304 Bye.
###2305 FELICIA: Well it turns out he was going to murder her.
###2307 He was going to murder her if she hadn't have called him
###2309 over to help out with that conversation.
###2312 
###2315 Yeah, I think in the context of him being a murderer it
###2317 wasn't as creepy.
###2319 But without him being the murder, had he been a
###2322 legitimate love interest at the end, I would have said, oh
###2325 that guy's creepy, please don't go with him.
###2326 But when he turned out to be a psycho at the end I was like,
###2329 oh, I saw that.
###2330 He wasn't as bad as he could've been.
###2331 
###2334 KIALA: I thought the walking home from the bar was just
###2336 really presumptuous and creepy.
###2338 Like you shouldn't ever trust a dude that wants to do that.
###2343 But other than that, his persistence wasn't rapey.
###2349 I didn't think it was rapey.
###2350 He didn't try to do anything.
###2353 He respected that.
###2354 He respected that she wasn't ready to do anything.
###2356 FELICIA: Well considering the one sex scene in the book, or
###2359 the one of two or three, but the big one was with him,
###2363 after you find out he's the bad guy it's a bold writing
###2366 choice which I thought was kind of refreshing.
###2368 And the fact that she nuanced his character in a way that
###2371 you weren't like, get away from him.
###2374 Which I still think that's really good writing where you
###2376 can have a three dimensional character like that.
###2378 VERONICA: It's pretty messed up that he was like, yeah, I
###2380 was going to kill you.
###2381 But then I fell in love with you so you're fine.
###2384 It's good.
###2385 We should just run away together.
###2386 BONNIE: That's a spite thing.
###2387 I'm sorry.
###2389 You know what the funny thing is?
###2390 Is that, I think a lot-- and I'm going to be presumptuous
###2392 here and I apologize to any guys that are watching--
###2395 but I think a lot of guys think that girls want to be
###2398 walked home from bars, and they want a guy that's a
###2401 little bit more, I don't want to say forceful but a little
###2405 more aggressive.
###2405 Because I live in a city full of apathetic hipster dudes
###2410 that could basically take their pick of chicks, and so
###2413 they don't do any effort.
###2415 So when you see somebody in a book like that making an
###2419 effort, yeah he came off kind of creepy, kind of stalkery.
###2422 But when you look at a lot of romance novels and movies and
###2425 TV shows where the guy's making that extra effort to
###2428 bring flowers, to find out where she lives, to offer to
###2431 build her stupid crappy IKEA bookcase for her, that to me
###2436 seems flirty, not oh my God, this guy's going to
###2439 kill me in my sleep.
###2440 So maybe I'm just living a dangerous life, but I thought
###2445 it was cute that he was a little bit more aggressive
###2448 instead of her having to chase down everybody.
###2450 VERONICA: SMH Bonnie, SMH.
###2453 Which means apparently shaking my head.
###2455 KIALA: Oh maybe that's what it means.
###2457 VERONICA: That's what the YouTubers tell me.
###2460 KIALA: I like So Much Hate.
###2461 That's what I've decided it means.
###2462 VERONICA: I think it could be both.
###2464 FELICIA: I'm just going back to I just think it's good
###2465 writing that you can have these two interpretations
###2468 where it's definitely like, oh my God, I hate that guy.
###2470 And he was obviously a creeper.
###2472 I just think it's good writing.
###2473 OK, let's do casting.
###2475 BONNIE: OK.
###2477 So Roman, I said Jay Ryan who plays the guy on Beauty and
###2481 the Beast, because rwar!
###2484 KIALA: Really?
###2485 BONNIE: Yeah.
###2486 FELICIA: Or Roman?
###2486 BONNIE: Who?
###2487 Not the British guy on Beauty and the Beast.
###2489 The new Beauty and the Beast.
###2492 Roman.
###2492 FELICIA: For Roman?
###2495 BONNIE: Jay Ryan from Beauty and the Beast is like Roman.
###2499 And Carter, I got Misha stuck in my head because of
###2502 Supernatural.
###2502 I can't not think of that.
###2504 I mean, Supernatural's always going to do that to me.
###2507 FELICIA: I'm going to be on in January.
###2509 January, my episode's on.
###2510 KIALA: Yay.
###2511 BONNIE: You what?
###2512 FELICIA: My episode.
###2514 [INAUDIBLE]
###2514 episode's [INAUDIBLE].
###2515 KIALA: Yay.
###2515 It is always so weird to see you on episodes that I watch.
###2520 It's amazing but it's so weird.
###2522 FELICIA: It's a really good episode, you guys.
###2524 BONNIE: By the way, Jared is a huge Star Wars fan.
###2527 FELICIA: Oh, that is amazing.
###2529 BONNIE: And he always has his kid dressed as Yoda on his
###2532 Twitter and it's [INAUDIBLE].
###2535 FELICIA: Both of them are awesome guys.
###2537 OK, back to it.
###2538 Who was your Seth, Bonnie?
###2539 BONNIE: And then Seth was kind of hard because Seth was
###2542 supposed to be sort of like this geeky guy but he was
###2547 attractive, but he was downplayed quite a bit.
###2550 I don't know.
###2551 I couldn't figure out who to have for Seth.
###2553 
###2558 And then Eva Green for Georgina.
###2560 FELICIA: I had Eva Green for Georgina, which is so weird.
###2563 Roman was Richard Grieco from 21 Jumpstreet.
###2569 BONNIE: Oh my God, you did not.
###2571 FELICIA: And Seth was Ira Glass.
###2574 VERONICA: Really?
###2576 FELICIA: Yeah.
###2577 VERONICA: Huh.
###2577 KIALA: Really?
###2580 VERONICA: I can picture Seth in my head, but he doesn't
###2582 look like any actor that I can think of.
###2584 KIALA: Ira Glass?
###2585 BONNIE: Ira Glass?
###2586 FELICIA: Ira Glass is cute.
###2588 VERONICA: That's too cute, I think.
###2589 Ira Glass is too good looking maybe for Seth.
###2593 And too tall.
###2594 FELICIA: He is cute and very smart.
###2595 I met him once.
###2597 KIALA: No, he's cute.
###2598 VERONICA: Veronica, what about the hot British guy that you
###2600 interviewed on Sword and Laser Joe Acra--
###2603 Acra--
###2604 VERONICA: No, Joe Abercrombie?
###2605 No.
###2605 Too hot.
###2607 FELICIA: No, he's really hot.
###2608 I hung out with him at the last [INAUDIBLE]
###2610 I was at in Australia.
###2611 He can tan.
###2612 BONNIE: He is so hot.
###2613 VERONICA: He's so hot.
###2614 This is really unprofessional of me, Bonnie.
###2617 You should not have brought this up.
###2618 BONNIE: You don't understand.
###2619 I was tweeting at you when you aired that episode, and it was
###2623 like, hot, hot, hot.
###2624 It's like a running joke in the Sword and Laser community
###2627 that I think he's really good looking.
###2629 He's married with children.
###2630 I'm married.
###2631 It's not a thing.
###2632 BONNIE: I would pay good money to see both
###2634 his sword and laser.
###2635 FELICIA: Whoa.
###2636 BONNIE: Yeah.
###2637 Hot.
###2639 FELICIA: I had an author dinner where we all went out.
###2641 Rachel Caine and Trudy Canavan.
###2644 And then him and a couple of other authors.
###2646 We all went out.
###2646 And then we went really out late to get dessert at this
###2649 weird dessert cafe in the middle of Adelaide.
###2651 But it was really fun.
###2652 They're all really cool.
###2654 VERONICA: I like him a lot.
###2655 He's great.
###2656 So I actually have a casting for once.
###2658 I almost never have castings.
###2660 But Roman for me was Christian Camargo who played the ice
###2664 truck killer on Dexter.
###2665 He's Dexter's brother.
###2666 KIALA: Oh, his brother.
###2667 VERONICA: Yeah, his brother.
###2669 The kind of handsome but kind of creepy.
###2671 A little menacing a little bit.
###2674 Yeah.
###2675 That popped into my head.
###2676 That's why I got all excited when we started
###2677 talking about casting.
###2678 I'm like, oh my God, I got one.
###2680 FELICIA: You got one.
###2681 What about you, Kiala?
###2682 KIALA: I pictured Roman as Michael Fassbender
###2687 because I always do.
###2687 FELICIA: You always do Michael Fassbender.
###2688 KIALA: I know.
###2688 I know.
###2689 I know.
###2691 And then I pictured Carter, I think we talked about this but
###2696 we'll just talk about it, Misha Collins [INAUDIBLE] in
###2699 his persona but I pictured him as Eric Northman and I can't
###2702 think of the black guy's name right now, but yeah.
###2706 VERONICA: Sarsgaard.
###2707 KIALA: Sarsgaard.
###2709 VERONICA: Which one, though?
###2710 KIALA: Not Peter.
###2712 Not [INAUDIBLE].
###2715 Something Sarsgaard.
###2717 VERONICA: Alexander?
###2718 KIALA: Alexander Sarsgaard.
###2721 VERONICA: Alex Sarsgaard
###2723 KIALA: And then for Seth, I don't know.
###2729 BONNIE: I know, right?
###2729 VERONICA: Yeah Seth is hard.
###2731 BONNIE: At first I thought maybe Seth could be like David
###2733 Tennant with glasses.
###2735 FELICIA: Oh, oh, oh, oh.
###2737 The new Q in James Bond.
###2738 BONNIE: Oh, perfect.
###2740 VERONICA: Oh.
###2741 Wait as who?
###2741 Who as Seth?
###2743 BONNIE: Seth--?
###2744 VERONICA: It's too hot.
###2745 BONNIE: Really?
###2746 VERONICA: Too hot still.
###2747 That guy's really hot.
###2748 FELICIA: No he is really hot.
###2749 KIALA: But I thought Seth was hot.
###2750 I thought he was cute.
###2751 FELICIA: I think he's hot.
###2752 He can be hot.
###2753 He doesn't have to not be hot.
###2754 BONNIE: He can be hot.
###2755 FELICIA: I think he's a little older though.
###2758 VERONICA: Yeah, older.
###2759 For some reason I picture him with sandy brown hair,
###2762 glasses, kind of stockier build.
###2765 Not thin but not fat either.
###2767 KIALA: Like Zach Galifianakis?
###2770 VERONICA: Too stocky.
###2772 A little too stocky.
###2774 BONNIE: Now I'm picturing him as Zach, and that's hilarious.
###2777 VERONICA: Not a built guy, just like a normal dude.
###2781 KIALA: Like a dude, like a hipster dude in Portland that
###2784 drinks a lot of beer.
###2784 And rides a bike but when he's drunk so he doesn't really--
###2789 VERONICA: Because in San Francisco you say hipster dude
###2790 and I think of super skinny tight jeans.
###2792 KIALA: Not here.
###2793 VERONICA: Not that kind of guy.
###2794 Like lumberjack hipster.
###2795 KIALA: Lumberjack hipster.
###2797 I built this record store with my bare hands.
###2799 FELICIA: Just do to Abbot Kinney in LA, you'll see 55
###2802 Seth's on the street.
###2803 VERONICA: But no beard.
###2804 I don't see him as having a beard.
###2805 BONNIE: I think he's like a Wilco kind of hipster.
###2808 KIALA: Oh, Chris Pratt.
###2810 VERONICA: I don't know who that is.
###2811 KIALA: From Parks and Recreation.
###2812 BONNIE: Yeah, the dumb guy who works in [INAUDIBLE].
###2814 VERONICA: Too young looking.
###2815 Too young looking.
###2817 FELICIA: Marie B. says Martin Freeman on the comments.
###2820 VERONICA: Also too young looking for me.
###2822 BONNIE: How about Ron Swanson?
###2823 VERONICA: No, too old looking.
###2825 Too mustachey.
###2825 KIALA: I thought of him as young because he had all the
###2827 t-shirts and stuff.
###2828 FELICIA: Oh, Sam from True Blood.
###2830 Sam Merlotte.
###2832 VERONICA: Way too handsome.
###2833 Way too handsome.
###2833 KIALA: Sam from True Blood saw me crying at DragonCon.
###2837 BONNIE: Why were you crying at DragonCon?
###2839 KIALA: Oh God, I just had some bad news and I was hiding in
###2842 the kitchens and he walked back and he saw me crying.
###2847 And then five minutes later Spike walks
###2849 through and saw me crying.
###2852 BONNIE: Did get a hug?
###2854 VERONICA: They didn't console you?
###2856 KIALA: No.
###2857 I wanted them too.
###2859 BONNIE: Man, Spike consoling you at DragonCon?
###2861 You know how many fantasies that would've
###2862 completed for all of us?
###2864 KIALA: I know.
###2864 Oh wow.
###2865 VERONICA: OK so someone on the chat said Seth Green as Seth.
###2871 That actually popped into my head except still
###2873 a little bit stockier.
###2874 BONNIE: Seth's cute though.
###2874 KIALA: Yeah.
###2875 FELICIA: I don't agree with your vision of Seth but OK.
###2877 VERONICA: OK.
###2877 It's fine.
###2878 It's fine.
###2878 We don't have to agree.
###2879 FELICIA: It's fine.
###2880 BONNIE: I feel creepy for saying this because I'm
###2883 friends with Seth and I think of him like a brother.
###2884 But he's still pretty cute.
###2887 He's doable.
###2887 Whereas I think Seth in the book, that's a stretch.
###2891 FELICIA: Really?
###2892 VERONICA: I wanted Seth in the book to be cute enough that--
###2897 this is really not cool to say--
###2899 BONNIE: Say it.
###2900 VERONICA: Like not an immediate overwhelming
###2904 attraction.
###2904 The way that Georgina felt.
###2905 Not like, oh wow.
###2906 This guy's really hot.
###2907 But more like, you're attractive and I'm really
###2911 getting to know you.
###2912 And I feel like we really connect on a brain level.
###2914 And so I'm beginning to get more attracted to you through
###2917 our mutual respect for similar interests.
###2920 BONNIE: So smart's the new sexy.
###2921 VERONICA: Yeah, and then all of the sudden you find
###2924 yourself finding that physical attraction.
###2926 Maybe it wasn't there at the beginning but it kind of
###2928 develops over time.
###2929 BONNIE: Someone on Twitter, Jem on Twitter said Anton
###2931 Yelchin from Star Trek could be Seth.
###2935 The new Star Trek.
###2937 I don't know.
###2938 FELICIA: Wait let's move on because we want to talk about
###2940 Dragon Actually.
###2941 VERONICA: Is he Chekov from the new Star Trek?
###2943 BONNIE: Yeah.
###2943 KIALA: Yeah.
###2944 FELICIA: Who read Dragon Actually?
###2945 BONNIE: I did.
###2946 KIALA: I read half.
###2947 BONNIE: Look at those abs.
###2948 FELICIA: We all read most of it.
###2949 OK.
###2950 So what did we think of this one?
###2951 This was the alt book and I want to read just the blurb.
###2956 "It's not always easy being a female warrior with a nickname
###2959 like Annwyl the Bloody.
###2960 Men tend to cower in fear or salute.
###2963 But for once it would be nice to talk to a real man the way
###2966 she can talk to Fearghus the Destroyer."
###2968 VERONICA: Too bad Fearghus--
###2969 KIALA: Fergus.
###2971 VERONICA: Fearghus.
###2972 KIALA: Fearghus.
###2973 FELICIA: Fearghus in the dragon.
###2975 And with him Annwyl feels safe.
###2978 But there's a twist.
###2980 Blah blah blah.
###2980 OK.
###2981 So basically it's kind of a medieval book about a girl who
###2986 has a loving relationship with a dragon.
###2988 And then this knight comes in and he's
###2990 like Mr. Sex On Wheels.
###2992 Turns out, same guy.
###2994 BONNIE: Look at those abs.
###2994 VERONICA: I doubt she did a dragon.
###2997 She did did a dragon.
###2999 FELICIA: So what do we think of this book Veronica?
###3002 You start this one.
###3003 VERONICA: So it was really funny.
###3007 Well first of all I got a big kick of the fact that it is
###3010 medieval kind of feel, but they totally speak regular.
###3016 Like they're hanging out at the coffee shop down the
###3018 street style talking.
###3019 Which is fine sometimes, but it just didn't really fit with
###3022 the setting all that much.
###3025 FELICIA: There was somebody--
###3026 I have to read this quote--
###3029 somebody said that it felt like it was kind
###3031 of out of the eighties.
###3032 Like everybody just had really big hair.
###3035 Like it came out in 2008 but it felt like
###3037 a massive 80s vibe.
###3039 It was Claire.
###3040 All the hair band maids, or the dragons were rocking.
###3042 VERONICA: Well how stupid was she to not realize that it was
###3045 the same guy?
###3046 It took forever.
###3047 It took freaking forever.
###3051 BONNIE: It was such a Lois Lane moment where
###3053 you're like, come on.
###3054 It's so obvious.
###3057 FELICIA: OK.
###3057 Keep going.
###3058 Sorry, I'm interrupting.
###3061 VERONICA: I also thought that the book was going to be a lot
###3063 longer because I was reading it on Kindle and there's
###3065 actually two books in the Kindle addition.
###3068 So I was like, what else are they going to put in this book
###3071 [INAUDIBLE]?
###3072 How much more can they talk about this storyline?
###3076 There's two books.
###3077 There's the story of the mother dragon and her mother
###3080 that kicks off at the end of the dragon book.
###3084 KIALA: Oh well we then I thought we read more of this
###3085 than I thought I did.
###3086 FELICIA: Yeah you did.
###3086 It's only 60% of the Kindle is the book that was the alt.
###3090 KIALA: Oh I was almost done.
###3092 FELICIA: Yeah it really goes on forever.
###3095 BONNIE: And so I don't know what you're talking about
###3096 because I still don't own a Kindle.
###3098 So I just read real books.
###3100 FELICIA: Bonnie I need to send you my Kindle.
###3101 I have a Kindle 2.
###3102 I'll send it to you this week, I promise.
###3103 BONNIE: But then I won't be able to touch the abs while
###3106 I'm reading.
###3107 VERONICA: Yeah.
###3108 FELICIA: True.
###3108 VERONICA: You can't show off on Muni with a
###3110 Kindle quite the same.
###3111 BONNIE: Oh I make a lot of friends on Muni by the way.
###3113 When I read this book on Muni last time I get hit on a lot
###3117 by cray cray.
###3117 Cray.
###3119 KIALA: Is that good?
###3120 BONNIE: I don't know.
###3121 But I was reading this and this burly guy sat next to me
###3126 and was like, oh that book looks interesting.
###3128 What's it about?
###3129 Dragon Actually, is it like Love, Actually?
###3131 And I'm like, well kind of.
###3132 I was like, it's a dragon and he said she's--
###3135 VERONICA: [INAUDIBLE]
###3135 He's a dude, and actually he's a dragon.
###3138 BONNIE: Yeah.
###3138 So I'm trying to avoid it, right?
###3141 And he just looks at me like, oh this girl's easy.
###3144 
###3146 FELICIA: OK Kiala, what did you think?
###3149 KIALA: Sorry [INAUDIBLE].
###3150 That's my boyfriend but actually he's a dragon.
###3153 VERONICA: Actually, yeah, he is.
###3155 He's a dragon.
###3156 KIALA: He's totally a dragon.
###3159 VERONICA: Oh my God, you guys, actually we've
###3161 totally been dating.
###3163 Totally a dragon.
###3164 KIALA: I'm actually a dragon.
###3165 VERONICA: Totally a dragon.
###3167 FELICIA: Kiala, what did you think?
###3168 What did you think?
###3168 KIALA: OK.
###3169 I thought it was really silly.
###3172 But the sex scenes were really good.
###3175 FELICIA: Oh my God.
###3176 Veronica snorted.
###3177 BONNIE: Oh wow.
###3178 Veronica's drunk.
###3179 FELICIA: She snorted so hard.
###3181 KIALA: She did it again.
###3184 She did it again.
###3185 VERONICA: Yeah but [INAUDIBLE].
###3186 FELICIA: What's going on?
###3188 
###3191 We're so drunk right now.
###3192 KIALA: But you guys, he'll light your
###3195 cigarette with his face.
###3196 
###3201 VERONICA: I don't even have to drive on the 405 anymore
###3204 because I fly on him, because he's a dragon.
###3207 Isn't that amazing?
###3208 KIALA: But you know what?
###3209 He totally found out when I wasn't a virgin anymore.
###3212 BONNIE: Oh my God.
###3214 KIALA: Um--
###3215 
###3217 BONNIE: We all need to be twirling our hair when
###3220 he talk like that.
###3221 Oh yeah, it is so embarrassing.
###3223 I can't believe it.
###3225 FELICIA: Bonnie what did you think of the book?
###3229 BONNIE: Aside from it being crazy jail--
###3231 like crazy bait on Muni, OK first of all, let me tell you
###3236 something about this dragon.
###3238 I was turned on by the dragon, here I'm doing this.
###3241 I was turned on by the dragon.
###3242 You know why I was turned on by the dragon?
###3244 Because he has a freaking library in his cave.
###3248 VERONICA: That is awesome.
###3249 KIALA: Yeah.
###3250 BONNIE: If you want to get me turned on, have a whole room
###3253 full of books.
###3255 That will turn me on.
###3256 I don't care if you're a dragon.
###3258 I don't care if you're a succubus.
###3259 I don't care if you're a Republican.
###3260 Well maybe Republican.
###3261 But [INAUDIBLE].
###3263 Well no.
###3264 If you're a hot Republican dragon with a library, I'm
###3266 willing to look over that.
###3268 Seriously.
###3270 KIALA: Depends on what's in your library.
###3271 BONNIE: And he picked out books for her.
###3275 Come on.
###3275 That is hot.
###3276 That is hot.
###3277 FELICIA: It was hot as the dragon, but what about the
###3278 knight part?
###3279 There was a lot of sex in this book.
###3283 VERONICA: It was kind of intense.
###3284 BONNIE: Yeah thanks for the sex book because that
###3286 fulfilled a lot.
###3287 FELICIA: See.
###3287 Everybody talked that wanted it.
###3289 Gave it to you.
###3290 BONNIE: Yeah I appreciated having a book
###3292 full of sex and dragons.
###3295 [INAUDIBLE]
###3296 dragon sex, actually.
###3298 I don't know why they left that out of the title.
###3301 VERONICA: Dragon sex better than dinosaur sex.
###3303 KIALA: Actually.
###3304 VERONICA: Actually.
###3305 BONNIE: Yeah.
###3306 [INAUDIBLE]
###3307 vanilla oil.
###3308 
###3313 FELICIA: And Emily on the forums on the question was
###3315 like, does Vaginal Fantasy have to
###3317 be good to be adorable?
###3319 Because I think it's a perfect description of the book.
###3323 Just don't even criticize it, guys.
###3326 Somebody was like, they were watching an '80s dragon movie
###3331 and they're like, I can do this better.
###3333 Oh wait I won't.
###3333 I'll do it [INAUDIBLE].
###3334 BONNIE: Which one?
###3334 Was it Krull?
###3336 FELICIA: It was Krull.
###3337 KIALA: Krull is amazing.
###3338 BONNIE: I love Krull
###3339 KIALA: Krull is amazing.
###3340 BONNIE: That would be so great.
###3341 Krull is awesome.
###3341 It has everything you could possibly need and Liam Neeson.
###3345 FELICIA: Huge hair.
###3346 That girl has huge hair.
###3347 KIALA: Oh, it is so good.
###3348 With her little face?
###3350 BONNIE: Yeah.
###3350 FELICIA: Yeah.
###3351 But I hated the word toerag.
###3354 Does anybody remember that?
###3356 KIALA: Yes.
###3358 FELICIA: I read it four or five times in
###3359 the book as an insult.
###3360 I'm like, what is going on?
###3362 What is a toerag?
###3364 What is a toerag?
###3365 
###3368 KIALA: Why would you have a rag on your toe?
###3370 And why is that an insult?
###3372 VERONICA: Alright toerag.
###3373 Toerag.
###3375 FELICIA: It's literally six or seven times in this book.
###3378 Somebody calls you, you toerag.
###3379 KIALA: Yeah.
###3380 BONNIE: Yeah.
###3382 KIALA: The first time I read it, I read it as kind of
###3384 Scottish or something like [INAUDIBLE]
###3386 or something like a name.
###3387 And I was like, oh, toerag.
###3390 FELICIA: No, it was an insult.
###3391 VERONICA: You you toerag.
###3394 KIALA: [INAUDIBLE] for moving, you toerag.
###3396 But it wasn't like that.
###3398 That's a bad accent.
###3399 VERONICA: What does that mean, you guys?
###3401 It's a rascal.
###3402 OK, they say it's a rascal.
###3404 FELICIA: What's a rascal?
###3405 Is that a known insult?
###3406 A rapscallion is a toerag?
###3408 I've never heard that.
###3410 KIALA: The little thing that fat people ride around on?
###3412 FELICIA: A lot of people in the comments know
###3414 what a toerag is.
###3415 VERONICA: Yeah YouTubers know what toerag means.
###3418 Is it from the '80s?
###3419 --Someone says.
###3421 A scoundrel, like a scumbag.
###3423 They're saying on IRC now.
###3425 FELICIA: Scumbag?
###3426 Is it a British thing?
###3428 VERONICA: But what does it mean?
###3430 KIALA: Where is the etymology?
###3432 FELICIA: Oh it's British.
###3433 It's British means scum.
###3435 BONNIE: Oh.
###3436 VERONICA: But why?
###3437 But why?
###3438 FELICIA: That's a whole different question.
###3439 KIALA: Maybe you can't afford socks and so you put
###3441 rags on your feet.
###3442 BONNIE: Yeah there you go.
###3443 It's a Cockney thing.
###3444 FELICIA: I don't buy it.
###3444 KIALA: So you put rags on your feet.
###3446 BONNIE: It's probably Cockney.
###3448 FELICIA: I don't buy it.
###3449 BONNIE: I don't know.
###3450 FELICIA: There was also a lot of spanking.
###3453 VERONICA: There was a lot of spanking.
###3454 But spanking's kind of hot.
###3455 BONNIE: That was good though.
###3456 FELICIA: It wasn't bad spanking but
###3457 it was copious spanking.
###3460 BONNIE: Really?
###3461 Copious?
###3461 KIALA: There was a lot of spanking.
###3462 BONNIE: OK.
###3463 KIALA: [INAUDIBLE]
###3463 Veronica.
###3464 FELICIA: There was a toerag's worth of spanking.
###3467 VERONICA: That's a unit of measurement?
###3469 FELICIA: I don't know.
###3471 I don't know anymore.
###3472 VERONICA: A metric toerag.
###3474 BONNIE: I don't think there's such a thing as copious
###3476 spanking, is there?
###3477 FELICIA: I mean, it depends on your level of spanking.
###3480 BONNIE: I don't know.
###3481 FELICIA: OK Pixie Fleming 89.
###3483 The definition of toerag derives from Old England where
###3486 convicts used to tie bits of shirt around their toes and
###3488 feet as makeshift socks.
###3489 Hence toerag means criminal or rapscallion.
###3493 KIALA: See?
###3494 I figured that out.
###3495 FELICIA: You did.
###3497 KIALA: Well I just saw Les Miserables, so
###3499 it's probably in there.
###3500 VERONICA: [INAUDIBLE]
###3501 I don't have time to Google things, jeez.
###3503 FELICIA: [INAUDIBLE]
###3504 Anne Hathaway.
###3506 KIALA: Literally I almost passed out from trying not to
###3508 cry because my mom was sitting next to me
###3510 sobbing like a baby.
###3513 I was trying to not hold it in and I almost passed out.
###3518 BONNIE: Am I bad if I just pretended Le Mis was a
###3521 Wolverine prequel?
###3522 VERONICA: You keep saying that.
###3523 OK.
###3524 So I went.
###3525 I tried to go, and our theater broke down.
###3528 FELICIA: I saw you said that on Twitter.
###3530 VERONICA: You did.
###3531 It was terrible.
###3532 I love you Bonnie.
###3534 But you already made that joke.
###3535 And I really love Les Mis so it hurts me in my guts.
###3537 BONNIE: You know what?
###3538 It's really [INAUDIBLE] on Les Mis, it's a [INAUDIBLE]
###3540 on Wolverine.
###3541 VERONICA: OK.
###3542 All right.
###3542 We can agree on that then.
###3544 FELICIA: The last half of Les Mis was kind of a snoozer.
###3545 OK?
###3545 But the first half was excellent.
###3548 VERONICA: I haven't seen it yet.
###3549 Because I tried to go and I couldn't see it.
###3551 KIALA: It is just the sobbiest sobb, sobb, sobby sobby.
###3555 Everyone in the entire theater is just crying out loud.
###3560 VERONICA: We saw Book of Mormon last night.
###3562 It was pretty good.
###3562 KIALA: Oh, was it funny?
###3564 VERONICA: It was really funny.
###3565 It was really funny.
###3566 BONNIE: Hey Felicia, when you said that Anne Hathaway should
###3567 win the Oscar, I thought you meant for Catwoman.
###3570 FELICIA: I think half the people that follow me on
###3572 Twitter actually believe that.
###3575 KIALA: She was really good in Batman.
###3577 VERONICA: She was good.
###3578 FELICIA: OK.
###3578 Guys, before we wrap up, there was a couple of questions
###3581 because I think we've done Dragon Actually, all right?
###3584 You guys will know what you're going to get into when you get
###3586 Dragon Actually.
###3586 There are a couple of just general questions people
###3588 posted on the thread.
###3592 This is our year anniversary.
###3593 Well I guess next month.
###3594 We started in January.
###3596 And this is the end of the year.
###3598 So as a couple of reflection questions, what would your new
###3601 year Vaginal Fantasy resolution be?
###3606 KIALA: To drink more.
###3608 FELICIA: OK.
###3609 KIALA: I don't know.
###3610 
###3615 Maybe I will try to always read The Ultimate.
###3618 Because I really have no excuse not to read it.
###3620 FELICIA: Yeah.
###3620 Oh that's a good one.
###3623 I'm going to try to pick more books that I
###3626 haven't read before.
###3629 Oh I want to poll the forums more.
###3631 Because these were forum picks.
###3633 You guys voted on the forums.
###3635 So I'm thinking maybe every other month
###3637 we'll do you guys pick.
###3639 I don't know.
###3639 KIALA: Yeah I think that would be great.
###3641 BONNIE: Yeah.
###3641 VERONICA: That's a good idea.
###3642 FELICIA: Because I always feel such incredible guilt.
###3644 We all picked one in a month.
###3645 And you feel like you disappointed your friends.
###3648 It's like, oh no.
###3648 People don't like my book.
###3650 VERONICA: Yes.
###3650 FELICIA: It takes such pressure.
###3651 So I think if we do every other month the forum gets to
###3655 pick the books.
###3657 Oh and actually next month is a forum pick as well.
###3660 Because it didn't go with this one as an alt.
###3662 So I picked one and three and then number two is going to be
###3665 the book next month.
###3666 BONNIE: I think it's a good idea because when we do our
###3669 meetups, well when Veronica and I did the meetup in San
###3671 Francisco, everyone that was there had really good
###3675 suggestions of books we should read.
###3677 And so I feel like leaving it up to the
###3679 forums is a good idea.
###3681 FELICIA: Yeah and it might be best to have people be able to
###3684 do write-ins and see what people are voting for.
###3688 It'll just be a public discourse over the month.
###3690 So that way even if you don't have one to volunteer other
###3693 people can write one in and post it.
###3698 You could change your vote too to see.
###3700 So we'll be able to have a really good process where it's
###3703 not a surprise.
###3704 So that will be my--
###3705 Also, what was your favorite book of the year?
###3710 And were there any books that you regretted
###3712 reading this year?
###3714 BONNIE: Oh.
###3715 You mean from our group or just in general?
###3718 FELICIA: Just in general.
###3721 VERONICA: The worst book.
###3722 Oh that's hard.
###3724 There were some stinkers.
###3726 KIALA: Yeah.
###3728 FELICIA: I feel the most bad about that sci-fi one, the
###3730 Linnea Sinclair one.
###3731 KIALA: That's the one I was thinking about.
###3732 The space one?
###3733 FELICIA: Yeah because that was such a bad book and she's a
###3735 much better author than that.
###3736 And I wish I had picked the book that I wanted to pick,
###3739 Hope's Folly, because that is a great book and we would all
###3741 have enjoyed it more.
###3742 And I picked her first book because I was worried about
###3744 continuity which didn't really apply either.
###3746 And I picked one that didn't represent her as an author as
###3749 well as I could have.
###3751 VERONICA: Yeah I can't think of which one
###3752 was my least favorite.
###3753 That was up there.
###3754 That was up there.
###3755 But I think that my resolution is going to be to make sure I
###3757 take more notes on lines and things that I like while I'm
###3761 reading so I can call them out later on the show.
###3763 And also to really practice with my casting.
###3766 I've got to get on the casting.
###3767 BONNIE: You don't have to do that, Veronica.
###3768 That's just something I do.
###3769 VERONICA: I actually get anxiety the day of the show.
###3772 I'm like, I haven't thought of any casting.
###3775 BONNIE: That's why I like Pinterest because if you want,
###3778 when you're on Pinterest you just pin hot guys that you
###3780 think would work well.
###3781 And then you have this already ready to go so when we do Vag
###3785 Fan you can just look at it and go, oh that guy.
###3788 VERONICA: Yeah.
###3788 FELICIA: Yeah.
###3788 No it's a very nice board you have there.
###3790 I have to say, I was like, oh.
###3791 This could solve a lot of my problems.
###3793 
###3795 BONNIE: If any of you follow me on Pinterest you'll see
###3797 that I have a Benedict Cumberbatch problem.
###3801 KIALA: Yes.
###3802 And on Tumbler.
###3804 BONNIE: And on Tumbler.
###3805 KIALA: Thanks a lot.
###3806 My Tumbler dash is all Cumberbatch all the time
###3809 because [INAUDIBLE].
###3810 BONNIE: Sorry.
###3811 I can't help it.
###3812 I'm so excited for Star Trek that I just--
###3814 I-- oh man.
###3817 FELICIA: Oh did you have casting for Dragon Actually?
###3819 I had casting.
###3820 BONNIE: Well let's see.
###3821 What's your casting?
###3822 FELICIA: Jessica Biel and The Rock.
###3825 VERONICA: I love The Rock.
###3827 I love The Rock.
###3828 FELICIA: I was just like, I want to see them.
###3830 They're amazing.
###3831 They're both amazing.
###3833 VERONICA: What's that new movie he's going
###3834 to be in with Marky--
###3835 KIALA: Mark Whalberg.
###3837 FELICIA: Yeah Mark Whalberg.
###3838 KIALA: I forget what it's called.
###3839 VERONICA: Marky-Mark.
###3840 KIALA: Or Fighters.
###3841 BONNIE: I have a hard time picturing what the dragon
###3843 should-- hmm.
###3845 I think the guy maybe from Arrow but with long hair.
###3848 FELICIA: Oh, with '80s hair?
###3850 BONNIE: Yeah.
###3850 With '80s hair.
###3851 But '80s hair is such a turn off for me with guys if it's
###3854 not like John Cusack, feathered hair.
###3856 KIALA: What if it was just like Adrian Paul from
###3859 Highlander, the series?
###3861 BONNIE: Yeah.
###3863 FELICIA: A comment on the forums that made me laugh a
###3865 lot about Dragon Actually, Megan says, it was like the
###3868 author watched Dragon Heart and thought, you know what
###3870 this needs?
###3871 More nipples.
###3871 And for Dennis Quaid to be a woman.
###3873 BONNIE: Yeah.
###3874 Yeah.
###3875 Actually.
###3877 That's a good idea.
###3878 Or not even Dragon Heart.
###3879 What's the other one with Christian Bale?
###3882 KIALA: Oh, Rain of Fire.
###3883 Rain of Fire.
###3885 BONNIE: I love that movie.
###3886 KIALA: That's a really good movie.
###3887 FELICIA: It's amazingly bad and amazing.
###3890 Why don't they make more movies like that?
###3892 BONNIE: I know, right?
###3892 I miss dragon movies.
###3895 KIALA: Oh, and Christian Bale as the dragon would be nice.
###3898 BONNIE: Yeah.
###3898 That's what I was thinking because of that movie.
###3901 KIALA: Because he's got the beard.
###3903 BONNIE: Yeah.
###3903 Like a scruffy, scruffy Christian Bale.
###3906 I don't know.
###3907 I like dragon movies.
###3907 I wish they'd make more.
###3908 FELICIA: They should.
###3909 It's a really high quality choice.
###3911 There needs to be more everything like that.
###3914 BONNIE: So my Vaginal Fantasy goal this year.
###3919 Don't focus so much on the comments, I guess, on our
###3923 YouTube channel.
###3924 Even though I'm programmed to answer every question.
###3928 I'll try not to take things personally when the people
###3931 tell me to shut my big old face.
###3935 And I don't really have a least favorite book.
###3938 Because even the crappy books we've read for Vag Fan I've
###3942 liked them because you've gotten me to read more.
###3944 So I'm just thankful that I'm reading more.
###3947 And then I'm just thankful that I'm in this group and
###3950 that I got you guys all to read Cthulhurotica.
###3953 VERONICA: Yay.
###3954 FELICIA: That was a good pick.
###3955 KIALA: Yeah and I enjoyed that.
###3956 Oh also I'm going to talk more.
###3958 
###3961 I'm trying.
###3962 Shy.
###3963 FELICIA: Your hair looks excellent too
###3964 today, by the way.
###3964 KIALA: Oh.
###3965 Thank you.
###3966 BONNIE: It does.
###3966 FELICIA: You're quite welcome.
###3967 OK we're going to wrap it up.
###3969 Next month's hangout is on January 29 at 8 PM.
###3973 We're going back to Tuesday nights.
###3975 Although this afternoon was kind of fun actually.
###3978 BONNIE: I like this.
###3978 VERONICA: It was fun.
###3979 KIALA: It was nice.
###3979 And good lighting.
###3980 FELICIA: Yeah it's very good lighting.
###3982 We're all very alert.
###3983 And then a lot of people in Europe were able to tune in
###3985 for the first time.
###3987 VERONICA: The problem is now that I'm drunk at 3 o'clock in
###3989 the afternoon.
###3990 KIALA: Yeah me too.
###3992 BONNIE: Honestly, I'm glad that we did this because I
###3996 like seeing you guys in daylight.
###4000 And also the fact that all of our UK and Europe fans get to
###4004 watch us because I'm a huge Anglophile so
###4007 that's kind of hot.
###4008 FELICIA: Well if you guys start a thread on the forums
###4010 about the time we could talk amongst ourselves if there's
###4013 any flexibility with moving.
###4017 Just start a thread on the forums and we'll discuss it.
###4019 And then our next month's book is the number two polled pick
###4024 that you guys voted for this month.
###4026 It is Outlander, by Diana Gabaldon which is being
###4030 adapted by Ron Moore for a TV show which is kind of cool.
###4033 And as an alt pick, I picked In Bed With A Highlander by
###4039 Maya Banks.
###4041 Extremely smutty.
###4043 BONNIE: Really?
###4043 VERONICA: Nice.
###4044 FELICIA: Well Outlander is such a meaty book.
###4046 It's kind of like Crucial Start.
###4049 I don't know if we'll actually get to the alt to discuss it
###4051 because Outlander is pretty thick and intense.
###4055 But I'll try.
###4056 But anyway, for you guys' enjoyment, it's a much less
###4059 serious version of the Highlander.
###4061 
###4063 BONNIE: The author of Outlander is pretty excited
###4066 that we're reading it for Vag Fan too.
###4068 FELICIA: Oh really?
###4068 Oh that's great.
###4069 VERONICA: No pressure.
###4072 KIALA: I've always wanted to read this book too.
###4075 I've picked it up so many times since I was like 17.
###4078 Has it been out that long?
###4080 I don't know.
###4081 I'm old.
###4081 FELICIA: [INAUDIBLE] you are.
###4083 OK.
###4084 Well thanks you guys.
###4085 We'll see you next month, January 29.
###4087 VERONICA: I've got go hang out with [INAUDIBLE].
###4088 And [INAUDIBLE] too.
###4090 FELICIA: Oh yeah.
###4091 All right bye guys!
###4092 KIALA: Goodbye.
###4093
