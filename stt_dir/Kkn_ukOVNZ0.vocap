###12 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: A warm welcome on this Thursday, March 7, especially for anyone who`s
###16 dealing with this frosty reception. A winter storm? Yes, another one hammered parts of
###22 the Midwestern and Northeastern United States this week. Power outages, schools and businesses
###27 closed, flights canceled. Chicago had a record one-day snowfall on Tuesday. CNN`s Ted Rowlands
###34 was there.
###34 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###34 TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And this is not only in Chicago. Of course, it`s hitting
###38 the Midwest, Minneapolis, North Dakota, getting in excess of a foot of snow, and the system
###43 is heading east.
###44 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`ve gotten our yardstick out, and at least where I am, I`ve measured
###49 from place to place where it looked like the snow was untouched, about six inches of snow
###54 so far. Right here in downtown Winchester, although that`s by no means a scientific reading.
###61 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Many airlines canceled. A number of flights, hundreds, in facts, and
###65 where I`m at Dulles is a big hub for United Airlines as is Chicago`s O`Hare airports.
###71 So, United is taking a big hit. They canceled about 700 flights.
###74 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The highest waves during Sandy were maybe 40 miles an hour, but this
###79 time we are talking about 12 to 15 foot seas. Now, you can see the damage that is still
###85 pretty clear about what happened during Hurricane Sandy. Look, so many houses still have been
###90 destroyed or are heavily damaged.
###92 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###93 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###94 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? Members of OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
###100 Countries, are all Middle Eastern nations.
###103 Not true. OPEC includes countries from Africa and South America, too.
###111 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###114 AZUZ: Like Venezuela, a country of more than 28 million people that`s in the northern part
###119 of South America. Oil is huge part of Venezuela`s economy. It`s one of the biggest industries
###124 in the country, that`s responsible for roughly 95 percent of all the money that Venezuela
###129 earns by selling products to other nations. Venezuela`s in the middle of seven days of
###134 mourning. The country`s long time leader, Hugo Chavez, died this week. His casket was
###138 moved to a military academy yesterday. That`s where his state funeral is scheduled to happen
###143 tomorrow. Venezuela will set a date to elect a new leader in the next 30 days. During this
###149 time, as President Hugo Chavez`s supporters argue that he gave Venezuelans the sense of
###153 national pride. His critics argue that Chavez ruined this country`s economy and restricted
###158 people`s liberties. Controversy plays a large role in Chavez`s legacy.
###162 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###163 HUGO CHAVEZ: Victoria! Victoria!
###165 AZUZ: He relished being at the center of controversy. So, it`s no wonder his friends and foes had
###171 very different takes on the Chavez legacy.
###173 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He`s made Venezuelans feel proud to be Venezuelan again. And not
###179 as something, I think that really no other leader has ever done in that country before.
###183 In fact, they were doing the opposite.
###185 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He`s destroyed the economy and centralized all power in his hands, decimated
###191 the democratic institutions in the country and left Venezuelan democracy in even worse
###197 shape. So it`s a pretty negative legacy.
###200 AZUZ: Chavez`s rhetoric often aimed at the United States or at multinational corporations.
###206 It invoked the promise of a socialist utopia, but Hugo Chavez had what most other Latin
###211 American leftists did not - oil. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world,
###217 along with Saudi Arabia. That oil wealth enabled Chavez to offer up free education and healthcare
###223 in his own country. The price of his socialist agenda - Hugo Chavez himself, presidential
###228 term limits were abolished. Even his critics admit, he could have gone on winning elections
###233 indefinitely. His biggest failure maybe his success, a legacy of one. Friends and foes,
###239 the Chavez legacy is filled with both.
###242 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###244 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me. I`m a type of vehicle that`s been around for
###250 more than 100 years. My name comes from a Latin word that refers to a combination of
###256 things. In my case, that`s internal combustion engine and an electric motor. I`m a hybrid.
###267 A vehicle that runs on fuel and electricity.
###270 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###272 AZUZ: Volkswagen is coming out with a new hybrid car that the company claims would get
###278 the equivalent of 261 miles per gallon. Considering that the standard Toyota Prius gets around
###284 50, this is significant. But this doesn`t mean that the XL 1, as it`s being called,
###290 will get you across the country without stopping. Between battery and diesel power, VW says,
###295 it will go about 310 miles total, which is about 90 miles less than your average sedan
###301 on a full tank of gas. But the XL 1`s engine only needs about 2.6 gallons of diesel to
###307 fill it. So, a fill-up at today`s prices would cost about 11 bucks. It`s incredibly aerodynamic,
###313 significantly more so than a Chevy Corvette, for example, and it certainly looks futuristic.
###319 But it`s not fast. It will take over 12 seconds to get you from zero to 60. Its top speed
###324 will be about 100 miles per hour, though, of course, none of us would ever drive that
###328 fast. It`s also not expected to be cheap, and it may not even be available in the U.S.
###333 But Europeans, who want fuel mileage bragging rights and can still afford the car, may have
###339 something to brag about.
###341 One week ago, we told you about Jhaquiel Reagan. While he was walking to a job interview, he
###345 made an impression on a local restaurant owner and got a job there. It is a great story about
###349 one person`s work ethic, but it`s not the end of the story, and it`s not the end of
###354 Jhaquiel`s impressive display of character. WXIN`s Kent Erdahl picks up the story.
###360 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###360 KENT ERDAHL, WXIN CORRESPONDENT: Jhaquiel Reagan has met a lot of people since setting
###365 off on a ten-mile to a job interview days ago, an interview that he wouldn`t even end
###369 up needing after meeting the owner of Papa Ru on his way.
###373 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m thinking to myself, here`s a kid walking almost ten miles in ice
###377 and slush and snow for the hope of a job at minimum wage, just like the kind of story
###382 your parent used to tell - my parents used to tell - uphill both ways in the snow.
###386 ERDAHL: Jhaquiel`s stories also now stuff of legend - he`s been immortalized in his
###390 own editorial cartoon and seen his picture pop up on stories he can begin to translate.
###395 JHAQUIEL REAGAN: People all over the globe see me. It`s really crazy.
###398 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The story, as one of my customers put it, is redefining viral.
###403 ERDAHL: That`s because it`s generated more than just likes on Facebook. It`s created
###406 a new life for Jhaquiel.
###408 REAGAN: It really has changed quick. Like I went from sleeping on the couch to sleeping
###413 in my own house - in my own apartment.
###415 ERDAHL: You see, before meeting his new landlord, Jhaquiel was homeless and living with friends.
###420 He also didn`t have a phone.
###421 REAGAN: I was trying to get a hold of you last night.
###422 ERDAHL: Now, he is taking calls from the Chicago Bulls organization. They contacted him after
###427 seeing a certain hat on TV.
###429 REAGAN: They gave me some tickets to the Bulls. I was really impressed. It`s awesome.
###435 ERDAHL: As we showed you last week, Jhaquiel also received a free bus pass, though he hasn`t
###439 had to use it much after meeting plenty of coworkers who have offered to give him rights.
###444 REAGAN: I really appreciated. Really grateful.
###447 ERDAHL: Jhaquiel`s story didn`t just give him a job. In fact, they`ve gotten so much
###450 good publicity here at Papa Ru, that they`ve actually had to hire additional stuff to keep
###455 up with all the extra demand.
###457 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`ve got five new permanent hires.
###459 ERDAHL: Some of them spend time answering phones.
###461 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My cashiers have turned into receptionists.
###463 ERDAHL: Fielding dozens of donation requests for Jhaquiel.
###467 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Each slip is an individual contact of a person with a name and a number,
###472 and they want to help financially, each of these slips.
###475 EDRAHL: In fact, so many donations have come in that Jhaquiel decided to create his own
###479 foundation, saying half the money will go to help disadvantage people find work. The
###484 other half will go to him, but he`ll be sharing it with the most important people he`s met
###488 in the past days.
###489 REAGAN: 25 percent of my half is going to Papa Ru employees. Because they have been
###496 working their fingers to the bone while all of this has been going on. The restaurant
###500 has been more busy than it has ever been. And, you know, they really deserve it, you
###507 know.
###507 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###509 AZUZ: Are teenagers getting tired of Facebook? Just about everyone who tweeted me about this,
###514 said yes. A couple of new reports say Facebook`s younger users might be leaving for other sites
###519 and apps like Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram. Facebook still gained millions of users last
###525 year, and the company owns Instagram, but many teenagers are turned off by the number
###529 of parents on Facebook and privacy factors in it, too. Graham said on our Facebook page,
###534 he is posting less because he worries about colleges or potential employers seeing it.
###539 Students on Facebook can talk to us there. Teachers, you can talk to us at cnnstudentnews.com.
###545 Please let us know your thoughts on today`s show.
###547 Something you may not know about me. I can juggle - not well. So already I thought this
###552 Youtube video was impressive. But watch this guy`s left hand and listen closely.
###558 You noticed what`s going on there? Every time he catches the cube, he is moving its pieces.
###566 The only way I ever solved a Rubik`s cube was by taking the stickers off and moving
###570 them around. This guy is doing it one-handed while he juggles. Show off. We`d suggest like
###575 a mic drop, but it doesn`t look he ever drops anything. We are going to grade that performance,
###580 but we didn`t have a good Rubik for it. He posted that video right before Valentine`s
###584 day. You might think that`s puzzling, but it was just in time for Cupid, and if he ever
###587 takes his show on the road, I just hope he stays safe, because it can be a real juggle
###590 out there. I`m Carl Azuz, enjoy the rest of your day.
