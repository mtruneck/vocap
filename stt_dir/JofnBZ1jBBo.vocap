###1 Zeus,
###3 Surya,
###5 Thor,
###7 For thousands of years
###9 ancient mits have described gods
###11 who came down from the heavens.
###13 Always you have someone
###15 who is descending from the sky
###17 with loud noise,
###19 with thundering, with fire, with smoke.
###23 They would have come the most
###24 powerful and magical place
###26 possible... from the stars.
###28 NARRATOR: But just who were
###30 these mystical beings that
###31 ruled the skies with
###32 supernatural powers?
###34 David CHILDRESS: You could
###35 wonder if these tales of Zeus's
###38 thunderbolts, Thor's hammer,
###40 if these weren't real weapons.
###43 NARRATOR: Did our ancient
###44 ancestors create the gods from
###46 their own imaginations?
###48 Or did they simply report
###49 events they believed to be true?
###52 GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS: Our
###53 ancestors misinterpreted
###56 extraterrestrials as gods,
###58 because that is was the only way
###61 that they could explain away
###62 what they witnessed.
###64 NARRATOR: Millions of people
###65 around the world believe we have
###67 been visited in the past by
###69 extraterrestrial beings.
###70 What if it were true?
###74 Did ancient aliens really help
###76 to shape our history?
###78 And were the gods of
###80 our ancestors actually visitors
###82 from other worlds?

###116 NARRATOR: Truva, Turkey.
###119 For over 150 years, this small
###121 city has been the center of one
###123 of the greatest archaeological
###125 finds in modern history: the
###128 possible discovery of the
###130 legendary city of Troy.
###136 In 1868, amateur archaeologist
###139 Heinrich Schliemann, set out to
###141 find what he believed was the
###143 city that served as the basis
###145 for the Trojan War, as described
###147 in one of the greatest pieces of
###149 classical literature, Homer's
###151 epic poem, the Iliad.
###154 Written in the eighth century
###157 BC, Homer's Iliad tells the
###160 tale of a great war, born of
###162 feuding and jealous gods.
###165 While most scholars believed
###167 the story of the Trojan War was
###169 a work of fiction, Schliemann
###171 was determined to prove the
###173 myth was a reality.
###177 Richard RADER: Heinrich
###178 Schliemann's discoveries rocked
###179 the archaeological world.
###181 Armed with his copy of the
###183 Iliad, basically, he just
###186 decided that he was gonna find
###187 Troy.
###188 And so he went and just dug a
###192 big hole, and when he went, he
###195 discovered the real Troy.
###205 NARRATOR: But if Homer's
###208 story of Troy was true, what
###210 would it say about other Greek
###212 stories and myths?
###214 Might those also be true?
###218 Did powerful gods and goddesses
###220 actually exist?
###224 And, if so, where did they come
###227 from?
###232 Hellas, also known as Greece.
###235 Each day, thousands of tourists
###238 visit temples and monuments
###241 built to honor the gods of
###242 another age.
###244 The Acropolis...
###247 Delphi...
###250 The Parthenon...
###253 The Temple of Apollo.
###255 These ancient sites reflect a
###258 powerful reverence for beings
###260 that supposedly ruled the world
###262 thousands of years ago.
###267 CHILDRESS: When you look at
###269 many of the mythologies around
###272 the world, they have these
###273 stories of gods coming down from
###276 the sky.
###280 RADER: There's a beautiful
###281 description of the way that the
###283 gods move, like, when they kind
###285 of come down to the Earth.
###286 You get the sense of them
###288 gliding down, but the way that
###290 they move is kind of beyond
###292 time.
###293 It just kind of happens.
###294 NARRATOR: If the ancient
###295 Greeks invented the stories of
###297 gods as a primitive attempt to
###300 explain their universe, how can
###302 we account for similar deities
###304 found in widely different
###306 regions and cultures around the
###307 globe?
###310 Was it mere coincidence?
###312 Or was there a common origin
###314 for these gods, who supposedly
###316 traveled to Earth from the
###318 skies?
###326 Jason MARTELL: The earliest
###327 civilization we have, 3800 BC,
###330 the Sumerians actually give us
###332 visual descriptions of these
###333 beings and speak of this time
###335 that they lived amongst their
###336 living gods.
###338 They called their gods the
###339 Annunaki and that term simply
###340 meant "those who from heaven
###342 come to earth."
###344 RADER: Mythology is chock...
###345 full of these episodes of gods
###347 coming down to earth.
###348 I mean, because mythology is so
###350 interested in the relationship
###352 between gods and humans, there
###353 is necessarily gonna be a lot
###354 of communication, and communion
###356 between the two of them.
###359 NARRATOR: In his 2000 book,
###361 Odyssey of the Gods, Erich Von
###364 D Niken argues that the world's
###366 sacred books are full of
###367 descriptions, not of gods, but
###370 of supernatural beings
###372 interacting with humans.
###375 Von D NIKEN: Some thousands
###376 of years ago, when our
###378 forefathers were still
###379 primitive, some
###380 extraterrestrials descended to
###382 our planet.
###383 And because of misunderstanding,
###385 like of technology, our
###387 forefathers thought that these
###389 extraterrestrials must be some
###392 gods.
###397 NARRATOR: Mount Olympus.
###400 Greece's highest mountain.
###403 According to ancient myths,
###406 this site was the home of the
###407 gods.
###408 (thunder crashes)
###411 It was here, on Mount Olympus,
###413 that Zeus sat on his throne and
###415 determined the fate of
###417 mortal men.
###420 TSOUKALOS: Whenever we have
###421 references to Mount Olympus, it
###424 is described to be this
###427 magnificent palace on top of
###430 Mount Olympus allegedly, and the
###433 temple walls were always
###435 gleaming of gold, or gleaming
###437 with silver, and a lot of little
###439 lights that they described as
###442 jewels.
###443 Well, if you look at that
###446 from modern perspective,
###447 what if that place... Mount
###451 Olympus... wasn't necessarily the
###453 top of a mountain, but it was,
###455 in fact, a spaceship, because it
###459 is described how sometimes there
###461 was a big rumbling with Mount
###463 Olympus, and the entire top
###465 lifted off.
###468 NARRATOR: But if Mount
###470 Olympus was home to alien
###472 visitors, could Zeus have been
###474 their leader?
###475 According to both the Iliad and
###477 the Odyssey, Zeus was often
###480 depicted as wielding a
###481 lightning bolt.
###483 CREMO: It appears to be a
###485 very powerful weapon because he
###489 could destroy whole cities with
###492 this thunderbolt weapon of his.
###495 NARRATOR: Similarly, Zeus's
###497 brother Poseidon, the God of
###498 the sea, was armed with a
###500 trident.
###502 CREMO: He was able to create
###504 tsunamis, tidal waves with this
###507 weapon.
###508 The trident weapon of Poseidon
###512 seems to have been something
###515 more than just a pitchfork.
###518 TSOUKALOS: So is it possible
###520 that the lightning bolt and
###521 the trident is some type of a
###525 direct energy device?
###530 NARRATOR: Arguably, one of
###532 the most important of the Greek
###534 gods was Apollo, who rode the
###537 skies in his chariot of fire.
###540 Von D NIKEN: Apollo first
###541 was the teacher of the young
###543 Greeks living there.
###545 He teach them how to make
###548 buildings on the mountain, on
###550 the hillside.
###551 He teach them how to make roads.
###553 He teach them in astronomy.
###556 NARRATOR: Centuries later,
###558 when Rome ruled over Europe and
###560 the Mediterranean, from the
###562 first century BC until the
###564 seventh century AD, the Romans
###567 paid homage to gods similar to
###568 the Greeks.
###571 Zeus was now known as Jupiter.
###575 Poseidon was called Neptune.
###580 But Apollo was known to both
###582 the Romans and the Greeks.
###584 Coincidence?
###586 Or, as most ancient astronaut
###588 theorists believe, was it the
###590 historical account of powerful
###592 beings that came to Earth
###594 thousands of years ago?
###595 (neighing)
###598 MARTELL: We know that the
###599 extraterrestrials more than
###600 likely are the source of what
###601 they call gods.
###603 How did they get here?
###604 More than likely in some type of
###606 craft.
###607 Philip COPPENS: What we map
###609 into our myths and our legends
###611 are incredible stories,
###613 incredible events, and any
###615 extraterrestrial being, any
###616 ancient alien who has come here
###619 on Earth, will be written down
###621 into this account because it is
###623 such an extraordinary event that
###624 it'll be marked forever.
###627 NARRATOR: But if the stories
###628 of Greek and Roman gods are
###630 true, can evidence of their
###632 existence be found in other
###634 parts of the globe?
###636 And, if so, where did they go?
###645 NARRATOR: On the northwest
###646 coast of France, just South of
###649 Brittany, lies one of the e most
###651 important prehistoric sites in
###652 Europe.
###656 At the seaside village of
###657 Carnac, over 3,000 megalithic
###660 stones are placed in rows over
###662 two miles long.
###665 The Carnac stones were hewn from
###668 local rock formations and
###669 erected between 4,500 to 2,500
###673 BC, at the end of the Stone Age.
###677 They are the largest collection
###679 of standing stones in the
###680 world.
###684 CHILDRESS: Archaeologists are
###686 baffled by the many megaliths at
###688 Carnac here.
###690 It's clearly a massive
###693 construction project with blocks
###696 of granite weighing 50 to 100,
###699 to even up to 350 tons.
###704 Legends here say that giants
###706 built Carnac, but you have to
###709 wonder, what is the real purpose
###711 of these giant megaliths, and
###714 why would prehistoric people
###717 have moved all of these massive
###721 stones and placed them in the
###723 many alignments here at Carnac?
###728 CREMO: Thousands of large
###730 stones have been arranged in
###733 very interesting patterns.
###735 They're arranged in intersecting
###736 lines that form triangles that
###740 could only be visible from above
###745 the Earth.
###747 These arrangements of stones
###750 may have been a way of
###753 communicating with
###754 extraterrestrial beings.
###758 NARRATOR: The ancient Greek
###760 poet Pindar spoke of a mystical
###762 land called Hyperborea, far to
###764 the north, where the sun shined
###767 24 hours a day.
###772 Legends claim that Apollo
###774 visited Hyperborea, traveling in
###776 his chariot of fire every
###778 20 years.
###780 TSOUKALOS: Apollo would tell
###781 to the Greeks, "Okay, I've got
###783 to go see some other people.
###785 "I've got to go and teach them."
###787 And they're, like, "Well, where
###788 are you off to?"
###789 And he's, like, "Well, I'm
###790 actually going to a place that's
###791 beyond where the north wind
###794 comes.
###795 It's the land of the
###796 "Hyperboreans."
###799 NARRATOR: Although mainstream
###800 archaeologists speculate that
###802 the Carnac stones are most
###804 likely tomb markers, ancient
###805 astronaut theorists believe
###808 these stones are intentionally
###810 laid out in a unique geometric
###812 formation.
###814 Von D NIKEN: Many
###815 speculations existed since
###817 centuries, and only a few years
###819 ago, in France, they started to
###821 photograph this whole French
###823 Brittany by helicopters.
###825 And when they put the pictures
###827 together, all of a sudden,
###829 someone realized, hey, this is
###830 not coincidence.
###832 The distances of the lines are
###834 always the same... 2,860 meters.
###839 Or exactly the half of 2,860
###842 meters.
###846 The angles are always the same.
###850 It's Pythagorean triangles.
###853 It's all a gigantic
###855 geometrical pattern.
###857 From Stone Age, which
###859 is impossible.
###860 Our Stone Age people had no idea
###862 of Pythagoras' triangles.
###865 Pythagoras was about 420 BC.
###868 NARRATOR: Even though the
###871 geometric arrangement of the
###872 Carnac stones predates the
###874 Pythagorean theorem by more
###876 than 2,000 years, one question
###880 remains:
###883 Why were the stones arranged in
###885 such a precise pattern?
###887 CHILDRESS: The Carnac stones
###888 are one of the few things on the
###890 planet that can actually be seen
###892 from space.
###894 And they're a perfect marker for
###895 any kind of aerial vehicle
###897 looking down on the Earth.
###902 Many of the tourists w who com
###903 here to Carnac claim that they
###906 can actually feel the energy
###908 emanating from these granite
###910 megaliths.
###912 How did these ancient people
###914 know about this energy?
###917 Is it possible that they were
###919 able to use this energy to even
###922 move and erect these giant
###924 stones?
###927 Von D NIKEN: I am of the
###928 opinion that they were made on
###930 purpose.
###932 The extraterrestrials told our
###935 ancestor: do this and this.
###938 It's not the extraterrestrials
###940 who made the stone lines.
###942 It's the humans who made it,
###944 but by the order of the
###946 extraterrestrials.
###950 NARRATOR: But were the Carnac
###952 stones a signpost for an ancient
###954 astronaut called Apollo, as he
###956 flew his spacecraft high above
###958 the land?
###963 CHILDRESS: If the Greek God
###965 Apollo was really some kind of
###967 ancient astronaut, it's possible
###970 that the stones here at Carnac
###972 were a directional finder
###974 pointing the way to the far
###976 north, to the Hyperborea of the
###978 ancient gods.
###987 NARRATOR: Over 1,000 miles
###989 north of Carnac lies
###991 Scandinavia, home to an ancient
###994 people called the Norse.
###996 The Norse were tribal Germanic
###999 people who lived in what is now
###1001 known as Sweden, Denmark,
###1003 Iceland and Norway.
###1007 Norse legends record the
###1009 triumphs of great warriors with
###1011 advanced weaponry, sophisticated
###1013 combat techniques s and
###1015 navigational p prowess.
###1017 Like the Greeks, Norse mythology
###1020 includes supernatural beings,
###1023 other worlds and powerful gods.
###1030 But like the Romans, could the
###1032 Norse myths refer not to
###1034 different gods, but the same
###1036 gods as those depicted by the
###1037 ancient Greeks?
###1039 CHILDRESS: There are a number
###1041 of similarities between Greek
###1044 mythology and Norse mythology.
###1045 And many of the gods are, uh,
###1048 almost identical.
###1049 And they do much the same thing.
###1051 (thunder cracks, rumbles)
###1054 NARRATOR: Descriptions of the
###1055 Viking God Odin... the God of
###1057 war, death and knowledge...
###1059 and the Greek God Zeus, bear
###1061 striking similarities.
###1064 Jonathan YOUNG: Zeus and
###1066 Odin are both sky father gods.
###1072 They travel through the skies
###1074 in chariots because they are
###1075 akin to the solar, uh,
###1078 divinities.
###1079 The precursor to many, uh,
###1082 religious beliefs is sun
###1083 worship.
###1084 The ancients knew that life came
###1086 from the sun.
###1087 So that is a great mystery and
###1089 a source of great awe.
###1095 COPPENS: What you're getting
###1097 there is not just some minor
###1098 deity, but you really are
###1099 nailing it down to one of the
###1101 chief deities.
###1103 This is a very important
###1104 character.
###1105 And so whoever is behind Odin
###1106 or Zeus is obviously a person,
###1109 or a divine entity, which is
###1112 shared by these cultures.
###1114 And it's clear that whoever
###1116 inspired the myth of Zeus or
###1119 Odin is somehow somebody who had
###1122 an extremely important
###1123 contribution to make to both
###1124 civilizations.
###1125 So this entity was definitely
###1128 known throughout Europe.
###1134 NARRATOR: Ancient alien
###1135 theorists also point to
###1137 similarities between the
###1138 sophisticated weapons possessed
###1140 by both the Norse and the Greek
###1141 gods.
###1142 Among Odin's weapons was a spear
###1145 that never missed its target.
###1148 The Norse God Thor, God of
###1150 storms, strength and fertility,
###1153 wielded a powerful hammer.
###1156 TSOUKALOS: Right there we
###1157 have a correlation, a
###1158 connection, because not only
###1160 does Zeus have the thunderbolt,
###1162 but what does Odin have?
###1164 And Thor?
###1165 They have a hammer.
###1167 Thor has a hammer with which he
###1169 can smash things, destroy
###1171 things, and, you know, the
###1173 hammer idea is pretty close with
###1177 the description to the lightning
###1179 rod that Zeus has.
###1183 CHILDRESS: So you have to
###1184 wonder if these tales of Zeus's
###1185 thunderbolts, Thor's hammer...
###1188 if these weren't real weapons,
###1191 just like we have today, where
###1194 we have directed energy-beam
###1196 weapons, or are developing some
###1198 kind of literal thunderbolt
###1201 coming out of a spacecraft.
###1204 (weapons zapping)
###1207 (wind whistling)
###1211 NARRATOR: But such
###1212 similarities are not limited o
###1214 the Greek and Norse myths.
###1217 In India, the ancient epic of
###1219 the Mahabharata describes
###1222 visitations from gods that
###1223 possessed the advanced
###1224 technology of space travel.
###1227 Von D NIKEN: There you can
###1229 read, some thousands of years
###1230 ago, gigantic cities surrounded
###1234 our planet.
###1235 They used the word "cities,"
###1236 because they had no word for
###1238 "mother spaceship."
###1240 And of a sudden, out of these
###1242 cities, smaller spacecrafts
###1244 came out.
###1246 Of course, in ancient India,
###1248 they had no word like
###1249 "spacecraft," so they called it
###1251 "Vimana."
###1256 >> NARRATOR: The ancient texts
###1258 of the Hebrew Bible also
###1260 describes a prophet who traveled
###1262 the skies in a sophisticated
###1263 machine.
###1267 >> Von D NIKEN: Who is Enoch?
###1269 He was the seventh antediluvian
###1272 prophet in the Old Testament,
###1275 including the Torah of the
###1276 Jewish community.
###1278 Enoch is only described with two
###1280 phrases, that's all.
###1282 And it says that the Lord took
###1284 him away in a fiery chariot
###1286 into the heaven.
###1289 >> NARRATOR: But technology was
###1291 not the only characteristic
###1292 these ancient deities had in
###1294 common.
###1295 According to legends, the gods
###1297 enjoyed intimate relations with
###1299 humans.
###1300 But if aliens did choose human
###1302 women as their sexual partners,
###1305 what was their motivation?
###1307 And just what was the outcome of
###1309 these very close encounters?
###1320 NARRATOR: Ancient myths are
###1321 full of stories of gods
###1323 descending to Earth to mate with
###1324 humans.
###1327 CHILDRESS: According to many
###1328 sources, including Norse
###1329 mythology, Greek mythology and
###1331 even the Bible, we have the
###1333 stories of the sons of God,
###1336 or actual gods, from Mount
###1338 Olympus or Valhalla, and
###1340 they're coming to Earth.
###1342 They find, uh, the daughters of
###1344 men attractive.
###1346 TSOUKALOS: When all these
###1347 encounters happened, and when
###1349 women slept with those gods...
###1352 which can be found in multiple
###1355 texts all around the planet...
###1360 that those women actually had
###1363 sex with extraterrestrials,
###1365 not with gods.
###1366 'Cause gods do not exist.
###1369 (thunder crashing, rumbling)
###1371 NARRATOR: According to
###1372 Homer's Iliad, the citizens of
###1374 Sparta were renowned for their
###1376 heroic warriors and their
###1377 beautiful women.
###1380 Zeus, the Greek God of the sky,
###1383 admired a human named Leda.
###1387 One afternoon, while Leda walked
###1389 alone in an orchard, Zeus
###1391 changed into a swan, enveloped
###1394 her in his powerful wings, and
###1396 made love to her.
###1398 Only later did Leda realize she
###1400 had been impregnated by a God.
###1404 CHILDRESS: When you look at
###1405 Greek mythology, and many of the
###1407 mythologies around the world,
###1409 they have these stories of gods
###1412 coming down from the sky, and
###1415 have sexual intercourse
###1416 with these humans, and, in a
###1419 sense, create a new breed of
###1421 human.
###1426 NARRATOR: The offspring of
###1427 these couplings were described
###1429 by the ancients as demigods, or
###1431 half-gods.
###1436 Experts suggest demigods were
###1437 supernatural hybrid beings of
###1440 human and alien origin.
###1443 Ancient Greeks believed these
###1445 beings were exceptional...
###1448 and destined to perform
###1449 extraordinary feats.
###1454 COPPENS: It is a tradition in
###1457 many civilizations that there
###1459 were certain human children
###1461 who were somehow not human, but
###1463 somehow had a connection to the
###1465 stars, to a realm beyond Earth.
###1470 And this specialness seems to be
###1472 there from birth, and it somehow
###1473 seems to involve a DNA
###1475 component, which maybe science
###1477 needs to look at, and needs
###1479 to study.
###1481 NARRATOR: Some of the oldest
###1482 accounts of gods and humans
###1484 interbreeding can be found in
###1486 ancient Hindu texts.
###1489 CREMO: In the ancient
###1490 Sanskrit writings of India, we
###1492 find this account:
###1494 A Queen named Kunti mated with
###1498 a celestial being, an
###1500 extraterrestrial, who was known
###1502 as the sun God.
###1504 The product of this mating was
###1509 Karna, one of the heroes of the
###1511 Indian epic, the Mahabharata.
###1517 NARRATOR: Perhaps the most
###1518 famous demigod is the Greek
###1520 hero Heracles, also known as
###1522 the Roman Hercules.
###1527 Heracles was half-man/half-god,
###1531 conceived in the union of Zeus
###1532 and a mortal woman named
###1534 Alcmene.
###1540 Mainstream scholars have often
###1542 dismissed the tales of demigods
###1544 as fantasy.
###1546 (thunder crashing)
###1548 But ancient astronaut theorists
###1550 believe they reflect actual
###1552 living entities.
###1556 CREMO: These types of
###1558 accounts in the ancient wisdom
###1560 traditions have a modern
###1563 equivalent in accounts of alien
###1569 terrestrial hybrids, which is
###1572 part of the modern UFO alien
###1574 abduction type of account.
###1579 It's remarkable that we find,
###1583 in these modern reports, exact
###1586 equivalents in the ancient
###1587 accounts.
###1589 That suggests that we're
###1592 dealing with realities here.
###1595 We're not just dealing with
###1597 imaginary stories.
###1600 NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
###1602 theorists say the term "star
###1604 children" is another way to
###1606 describe the offspring of
###1608 humans and ancient
###1609 extraterrestrials.
###1611 They claim that in the early
###1613 traditions of nearly every
###1615 major world religion,
###1617 "star children" correlate to
###1618 supernatural beings known as
###1619 "gods."
###1621 TSOUKALOS: "Star child" is
###1623 an often-used reference in
###1625 ancient texts when a woman had
###1628 a quote, unquote "divine
###1629 interaction" with one of the
###1631 gods, often resulting in a woman
###1635 being pregnant without having
###1639 slept with anyone.
###1641 You know, is such a thing even
###1644 possible?
###1645 Yes, it is.
###1647 Today, artificial insemination.
###1649 That's what happens today.
###1651 You no longer have to have sex
###1652 in order to have babies.
###1654 We have the exact same
###1656 description thousands of years
###1658 ago, where women, without
###1659 sleeping with anyone, all of a
###1662 sudden became pregnant, and the
###1663 question is how is that
###1665 possible?
###1667 NARRATOR: Did aliens that
###1668 came to Earth in ancient times
###1670 use advanced fertility
###1671 technology?
###1673 CHILDRESS: Within Greek
###1675 mythology you have many strange
###1677 stories of centaurs, uh...
###1680 cyclops, weird genetically
###1683 human, uh, half animal
###1686 creations.
###1688 And you have to speculate,
###1691 at least to a point, that
###1693 there's a possibility of
###1694 strange genetic engineering
###1696 going on here, and creating
###1699 what are literal monsters in
###1701 the past.
###1703 CREMO: In some of the
###1705 writings of ancient
###1706 civilizations, we see accounts
###1709 of mating between
###1711 extraterrestrial beings and
###1714 humans, producing monsters or
###1718 giants or other similar types
###1721 of beings.
###1724 And why is that?
###1725 I believe it's because it has
###1728 actually happened in the past.
###1731 NARRATOR: Could these ancient
###1733 tales of enormous creatures...
###1735 half human, half beast...
###1737 be rooted in truth?
###1739 And if so, is there any
###1741 evidence these giant hybrids
###1743 really existed?
###1752 NARRATOR: Lovelock, Nevada.
###1755 In the early 1800s, local
###1758 legends passed down by the Piute
###1759 Indians told of a race of
###1762 giants who were exterminated by
###1764 their tribe.
###1767 It is said this was done by
###1769 trapping the giants in a cave,
###1771 shooting arrows at them, and
###1773 then starting a large fire at
###1775 the mouth of the cave.
###1778 Evidence of the slaughter lay
###1780 undisturbed until the early 2h
###1783 recenty.
###1790 CHILDRESS: Lovelock Cave was
###1793 first discovered by local
###1795 ranchers who were looking for
###1797 bat guano to use in their
###1799 fields.
###1801 NARRATOR: In need of
###1802 fertilizer for their crops, the
###1803 ranchers removed nearly ten
###1805 feet of guano-enriched soil
###1807 from the surface of the cave.
###1815 They found up to 40 or 50 people
###1819 inside this cave.
###1823 One was allegedly seven feet,
###1826 seven inches tall.
###1828 They all had long, red hair and
###1832 were literal giants.
###1836 NARRATOR: If these skeletons
###1837 were the remains of the
###1839 legendary red-haired giants,
###1841 were they visitors from distant
###1843 continents?
###1845 CHILDRESS: Throughout the
###1846 19th century, many giant
###1848 skeletons were allegedly
###1850 discovered in the Midwest, also
###1852 in parts of California and
###1854 around Death Valley.
###1856 And the skeletons here, found at
###1858 Lovelock, are one of the few
###1861 that were really excavated by
###1863 an accredited university.
###1866 NARRATOR: Archaeologists from
###1867 the Nevada Historical Society
###1869 and the University of
###1870 California believe the cave was
###1873 occupied from approximately
###1874 1500 BC until a few hundred
###1877 years before white men appeared
###1879 in the Nevada territory.
###1883 75 miles from the cave site,
###1886 a local museum has preserved
###1888 several skulls that some
###1890 believe are recovered remains
###1892 of the giants.
###1895 CHILDRESS: Inside this
###1897 cabinet here, are three skulls
###1900 from the Lovelock caves.
###1903 When you first see these skulls,
###1906 they seem to be pretty much
###1909 normal-looking skulls.
###1912 However, it's when we really
###1915 start to compare the jawbones
###1919 with this modern dental
###1922 impression of a normal adult
###1925 male, that we see that these
###1928 jawbones are unusually large.
###1932 And these are, really, the
###1934 skulls of giant people who were
###1938 perhaps seven, even eight feet
###1940 tall.
###1942 One of the odd things with these
###1944 skulls is that they're not
###1947 actually put on display here at
###1949 the museum.
###1949 And they're kept hidden in this
###1951 cabinet.
###1953 Now, we don't know if that's
###1954 really, uh, just out of, um,
###1956 respect for, uh, Native
###1958 Americans, or whether there's
###1960 really something unusual about
###1962 these giant skulls that they
###1964 don't want them to display.
###1966 NARRATOR: Are the Nevada
###1968 bones evidence of a race of
###1969 giants that existed all through
###1971 early human history?
###1974 If so, could the giants be the
###1977 descendants of
###1978 extraterrestrials?
###1980 According to the Hebrew
###1982 Testament, one such giant
###1984 appeared in the valley of Elah
###1987 2,500 years ago.
###1989 Each morning, for 40 days, a
###1992 Philistine giant over nine feet
###1995 tall challenged the Israelites
###1996 to a fight.
###2000 His name was Goliath.
###2004 COPPENS: David and Goliath
###2005 is one of those episodes
###2006 in the Bible where you
###2008 wonder what is going on.
###2010 Is it t just a metaphor or are e
###2013 dealing with a fundamental
###2015 interpretation?
###2016 And in that sense, Goliath has
###2018 to be a giant creature.
###2020 The question then is: "He cannot
###2022 be human. What is he?"
###2026 NARRATOR: David's stunning
###2027 triumph over Goliath was
###2030 considered a mere fable,
###2032 until archaeologists turned up
###2033 evidence that suggests this
###2036 confrontation really did happen.
###2039 On the outskirts of
###2041 Tell Es-Safi, Israel, scientists
###2044 discovered a moat that may have
###2045 once protected the Philistine
###2047 fortress.
###2048 Nearby, they found shards of
###2051 pottery inscribed with the name
###2053 Goliath.
###2055 Tests indicate the pottery is
###2058 from the same time period as
###2060 described in the Bible.
###2062 Ancient astronaut theorists
###2064 claim this is unmistakable
###2066 evidence of extraterrestrial
###2069 giants in biblical times.
###2072 And they say there is much more.
###2079 The most common megalithic
###2081 construction known is the
###2082 dolmen.
###2084 Believed to be burial chambers,
###2085 they are found throughout
###2087 Europe, the Middle East, South
###2089 America, and Asia.
###2091 Could these mega structures be
###2093 the ruins of giants?
###2097 COPPENS: Archeology likes
###2098 to use the word "dolmen," but
###2100 they were formerly known in
###2101 folklore as "giant's graves."
###2103 FATHER William FULCO: A
###2105 dolmen is shaped like the Greek
###2107 letter "pi" with the top on it.
###2109 And they're made of enormous
###2110 blocks of limestone.
###2113 And even today, it's...
###2115 We are marveled that anyone
###2116 could construct those things,
###2118 and wonder how they got the top
###2119 on top of the uprights.
###2121 And those were built during the
###2123 Middle Bronze Period, which is
###2124 roughly 2000 to 1500 before the
###2127 common era.
###2128 So seeing things like that,
###2129 people questioned, those
###2131 must've been made by giants.
###2132 I mean, ordinary people could
###2133 not have done that.
###2134 COPPENS: Are we dealing with
###2136 metaphors or are we dealing
###2138 with hard evidence?
###2140 Are these physical creatures
###2141 which somehow roamed the earth?
###2143 And I think, on volume, we have
###2145 to accept that some of these
###2147 were real.
###2148 The question, then, is how did
###2150 these genetic freaks come about?
###2153 TSOUKALOS: One of the main
###2155 tenets of ancient astronaut
###2156 theory suggests that a long
###2158 time ago, extraterrestrials
###2160 changed our genetic makeup
###2163 through a targeted mutation of
###2166 our genes, essentially in the
###2168 lab.
###2170 So they took a couple of human
###2172 beings, altered their DNA, then
###2176 reinserted those people back
###2179 into the population, so through
###2181 procreation, those people would
###2184 pass on those new genetic
###2185 alterations to the entire
###2187 population.
###2189 NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
###2190 theorists suggest the evidence
###2192 points to one conclusion, that
###2195 aliens changed the genetics of
###2197 early human DNA.
###2200 COPPENS: For an alien being
###2202 to work with DNA is so easy
###2205 that just creating a new type
###2207 is not at all that difficult.
###2209 Even today, we have the
###2211 capability to create new types
###2213 of animals.
###2215 The question is, were we
###2217 created as such, as well?
###2220 NARRATOR: But what reason
###2221 could extraterrestrial visitors
###2223 have had for populating the
###2225 Earth with mixed species and
###2226 monstrous hybrids?
###2228 Were they the result of some
###2230 kind of scientific experiment
###2232 gone terribly wrong?
###2237 Did ancient aliens have some
###2239 reason to experiment with human
###2241 DNA?
###2251 NARRATOR: The Galapagos
###2252 Islands, off the coast of South
###2254 America, are known for their
###2256 unique biodiversity.
###2260 In 1832, a naturalist named
###2262 Charles Darwin came to these islands to observe and record
###2266 several species of animals not
###2268 seen before.
###2270 The result of his studies
###2272 formed the basis for his
###2273 controversial book, The Origin
###2276 of Species.
###2277 In it, Darwin proposed his
###2279 theory of evolution, which
###2281 held that all life evolved over
###2283 time, through a process of
###2285 natural selection.
###2287 But even Darwin's theories
###2290 could not explain the
###2291 developmental gap between apes
###2293 and man.
###2295 There was, it was believed,
###2298 a transitional species that had
###2300 to exist, one which became
###2302 referred to as, "the missing
###2304 link."
###2306 >> TSOUKALOS: Homo Sapiens have
###2309 been around for 300,000 years.
###2312 And only in a few thousand
###2315 years, our brain size
###2318 essentially tripled.
###2322 Now, that does not jive with
###2325 ordinary evolution.
###2326 You need time.
###2328 A very long time.
###2331 However, today, biologists
###2334 cannot quite put a finger on
###2337 how our brain volume tripled in
###2340 a very short time period.
###2343 That is still a mystery.
###2347 >> NARRATOR: Could it be, as
###2350 many ancient astronaut
###2351 theorists believe, that ancient
###2353 aliens had a hand in
###2355 jump-starting human evolution
###2356 on our planet?
###2359 >> COPPENS: Science has been
###2360 unable to find the missing link,
###2362 and maybe that's simply because
###2364 Earth is unable to offer that
###2366 missing link.
###2367 Maybe the missing link is not
###2368 of this Earth.
###2369 Maybe the missing link is
###2370 somewhere outside,
###2372 extraterrestrial.
###2375 >> NARRATOR: In 1996, medical
###2378 science took a giant step
###2379 forward when geneticists
###2381 successfully cloned a sheep.
###2383 This revolutionary technology
###2386 marked a significant
###2388 advancement in our
###2389 understanding of DNA.
###2392 But could extraterrestrial
###2395 visitors have also possessed
###2397 knowledge of genetics?
###2401 >> MARTELL: In the Sumerian
###2403 records of mythology, they
###2405 explain how they genetically
###2406 engineered the first human
###2407 being.
###2409 And so, it's very possible that
###2410 extraterrestrials did
###2411 genetically engineer us.
###2413 >> COPPENS: More and more
###2414 creatures are being discovered,
###2416 as s science goes along, in
###2417 little caves, or on little
###2418 islands, whereby DNA evidence
###2421 clearly shows that something
###2422 else has been happening.
###2423 We're probably gonna get to
###2424 hard scientific fact that
###2426 something interbred with humans,
###2429 on certain occasions, certain
###2430 moments in time.
###2434 >> NARRATOR: Could the giants
###2435 and monsters described in the
###2437 ancient myths be examples of
###2439 genetic mutations?
###2441 And if so, what purpose might
###2443 they have served?
###2445 >> CREMO: There are actually
###2447 accounts in the ancient
###2449 Sanskrit writings of India of
###2451 how, in their original attempts
###2454 to produce...
###2457 living things in the universe,
###2460 the gods, or the
###2462 extraterrestrial beings, made
###2464 mistakes and produced different
###2468 types of monsters and giants
###2473 and things like that.
###2476 >> Von D NIKEN: Why should the
###2478 so-called "gods" first make such
###2481 mixed creatures?
###2482 What's the purpose of it?
###2484 Did they observe a lion, and
###2487 they say to themself, "Why don't
###2490 we mix the strongness of the
###2492 muscle of the one animal with
###2495 the heat expellant, uh, skin of
###2499 the other animal, to use it at
###2501 some other planet, which is
###2503 different Earth?"
###2504 So they start to make breedings.
###2507 They start to make mixed
###2509 creatures.
###2512 >> NARRATOR: Scholars and
###2514 archaeologists generally agree
###2516 that sometime around 3000 BC,
###2519 during the Megalithic Era,
###2521 mankind took a quantum leap
###2523 forward with regard to
###2524 civilization and use of
###2526 technology.
###2527 According to myths and legends,
###2529 human beings gave credit to
###2531 their gods for giving them
###2532 this knowledge.
###2534 But if the gods were, in fact,
###2536 alien visitors, might mankind's
###2539 quantum leap forward have had a
###2541 more intergalactic origin?
###2544 >> COPPENS: It is clear that
###2546 something affected multiple
###2547 continents on this planet
###2549 around 3000 BC.
###2551 The pyramids began to be built
###2553 at that moment in time.
###2555 Why?
###2556 What was that imperative?
###2558 Was it a global imperative?
###2560 Yes.
###2561 Was it an imperative which came
###2563 from outside of this world?
###2564 Yes.
###2565 >> NARRATOR: If aliens
###2566 intervened to speed the
###2568 advancement of human beings, is
###2570 it also possible that they have
###2572 influenced mankind at other
###2573 critical junctures in history?
###2576 And, if so, could they have
###2578 continued to monitor us,
###2580 even today?
###2581 >> MARTELL: It's very possible
###2582 that, if there was some type of
###2584 genetic intervention,
###2585 by an extraterrestrial race,
###2586 on humanity, they would be very
###2588 interested to see their
###2590 experiment progress.
###2594 >> Von D NIKEN: I am often
###2595 asked the question, "Iit not
###2597 ridiculous to believe that
###2598 extraterrestrials should, in a
###2600 way or other, look similar to
###2602 us, or even think similar
###2604 to us?"
###2605 No.
###2606 The question is wrong.
###2607 They are not, by coincidence,
###2609 similar to us, but we are
###2611 similar to them, because we are
###2613 the product.
###2616 >> NARRATOR: But if alien
###2618 beings did interbreed with
###2619 humans, why?
###2621 Was it to save their own
###2623 species?
###2625 Or, perhaps, hide the genetic
###2626 traces of their presence here
###2628 on Earth?
###2628 Could there even be aliens
###2632 living among us?
