1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:11,21



2
0:0:11,21 --> 0:0:13,52
ROB DYRDEK: What we didn't know
at the time is how crazy


3
0:0:13,52 --> 0:0:16,14
rapped-out ghetto he really
was, 'cause Jamie kind of


4
0:0:16,14 --> 0:0:16,9
cleaned him up.


5
0:0:16,9 --> 0:0:20,4
Like no jewelry, just kept him
like, you know how Jamie does,


6
0:0:20,4 --> 0:0:21,96
is like finds you and
like turns you


7
0:0:21,96 --> 0:0:23,98
into a street soldier.


8
0:0:23,98 --> 0:0:26,25
And he had just sort of cleaned
him up, to where when


9
0:0:26,25 --> 0:0:31,17
he finally quit to ride for
Alien, his inner hard-core


10
0:0:31,17 --> 0:0:35,66
Dallas/Michigan ghetto side like
exploded the moment he


11
0:0:35,66 --> 0:0:36,155
got on Alien.


12
0:0:36,155 --> 0:0:39,73
We're like, what the hell?


13
0:0:39,73 --> 0:0:41,21
JOSH KALIS: I mean, I
was just coming out


14
0:0:41,21 --> 0:0:42,94
of that Dallas shit.


15
0:0:42,94 --> 0:0:45,37
Tech N9ne earrings and Tech
N9ne pinkie rings.


16
0:0:45,37 --> 0:0:48,455
And I mean, we thought we
were kinda doing it.


17
0:0:48,455 --> 0:0:52,39



18
0:0:52,39 --> 0:0:53,23
JAMIE THOMAS: Well, Alien,
at that time,


19
0:0:53,23 --> 0:0:54,19
though, was that way.


20
0:0:54,19 --> 0:0:56,32
I mean, it was basically
all those guys, like


21
0:0:56,32 --> 0:0:58,62
corn rows and cargoes.


22
0:0:58,62 --> 0:1:1,78
And it was basically a full
product of the '90s.


23
0:1:1,78 --> 0:1:3,14
So all those dudes
were into it.


24
0:1:3,14 --> 0:1:5,83
Kalis went back to Texas and
filmed a lot of footage for


25
0:1:5,83 --> 0:1:7,39
his Timecode part, and
he had cargoes


26
0:1:7,39 --> 0:1:9,37
throughout the whole thing.


27
0:1:9,37 --> 0:1:13,47
ROB DYRDEK: Despite Alien having
that Memory Screen sort


28
0:1:13,47 --> 0:1:16,56
of crazy, artistic--


29
0:1:16,56 --> 0:1:19,0
that set this new precedent in
what video production even


30
0:1:19,0 --> 0:1:22,65
could be, us as a team, we were
united in this sort of


31
0:1:22,65 --> 0:1:24,56
like more broad scope.


32
0:1:24,56 --> 0:1:26,61
Like we weren't all flowing
around and artsy.


33
0:1:26,61 --> 0:1:28,93
We were all listening to hip-hop
and it was sort of


34
0:1:28,93 --> 0:1:33,5
like a nice blend of the artists
and the creation of


35
0:1:33,5 --> 0:1:33,93
what the brand was.


36
0:1:33,93 --> 0:1:37,37
But we all still sort of
maintained the same sort of


37
0:1:37,37 --> 0:1:38,185
style in unity.


38
0:1:38,185 --> 0:1:41,32
And it wasn't overly hip-hop,
but it wasn't like rock or


39
0:1:41,32 --> 0:1:42,64
anything else.


40
0:1:42,64 --> 0:1:45,44
And he fit into that really,
really well at the time.


41
0:1:45,44 --> 0:1:50,24
He was part of the beginning of
that new guard for Alien at


42
0:1:50,24 --> 0:1:52,146
that particular time.


43
0:1:52,146 --> 0:1:54,34
ANNOUNCER: Prepare
to timecode.


44
0:1:54,34 --> 0:1:55,59
Josh Kalis.


45
0:1:55,59 --> 0:1:58,93



46
0:1:58,93 --> 0:2:1,37
JOSH KALIS: To tell you the
truth, it had nothing to do


47
0:2:1,37 --> 0:2:3,6
with the image and
art direction.


48
0:2:3,6 --> 0:2:9,699
It had to do with Rob Dyrdek,
John Drake, and Duane Pitre.


49
0:2:9,699 --> 0:2:14,9
And in Bo Turner was like
one of the best dudes.


50
0:2:14,9 --> 0:2:17,59
He was such a ball breaker.


51
0:2:17,59 --> 0:2:21,19
I just wanted to be a
part of all that.


52
0:2:21,19 --> 0:2:23,17
We never talked about videos.


53
0:2:23,17 --> 0:2:24,21
Ever.


54
0:2:24,21 --> 0:2:25,89
I don't even know how
Timecode came out.


55
0:2:25,89 --> 0:2:30,28
Like I think Dyrdek and maybe
Mike Hill or somebody, I mean


56
0:2:30,28 --> 0:2:31,71
they just took whatever
footage people


57
0:2:31,71 --> 0:2:33,5
had and made a video.


58
0:2:33,5 --> 0:2:35,21
We weren't filming
for a video.


59
0:2:35,21 --> 0:2:36,74
We weren't doing any
of that stuff.


60
0:2:36,74 --> 0:2:38,6
They were just, like, man, we
gotta put something out.


61
0:2:38,6 --> 0:2:42,62
ROB DYRDEK: And at that
time, he was so raw.


62
0:2:42,62 --> 0:2:44,33
Nobody was putting it
down in the streets


63
0:2:44,33 --> 0:2:45,58
harder than he was.


64
0:2:45,58 --> 0:2:48,74



65
0:2:48,74 --> 0:2:51,89
STEVIE WILLIAMS: That's right
when he had the cover of


66
0:2:51,89 --> 0:2:54,7
TransWorld, doing a backside
180 with the Golden Gate


67
0:2:54,7 --> 0:2:55,31
Bridge in the back
with the Adidas.


68
0:2:55,31 --> 0:2:56,76
It was hot, yo.


69
0:2:56,76 --> 0:2:58,38
It was really, really hot.


70
0:2:58,38 --> 0:3:1,67
You know, me being out in
California in San Francisco,


71
0:3:1,67 --> 0:3:4,55
and Josh being Josh, and I was
still hanging with little hood


72
0:3:4,55 --> 0:3:5,12
motherfuckers.


73
0:3:5,12 --> 0:3:8,53
So he couldn't really hang with
me like that, like he


74
0:3:8,53 --> 0:3:9,72
could in Philly.


75
0:3:9,72 --> 0:3:12,795
But when Josh came through-- it
was still all love, but you


76
0:3:12,795 --> 0:3:15,5
know, as far as being
competitive and having a good


77
0:3:15,5 --> 0:3:17,97
sponsor and having a wack
sponsor, and shooting with the


78
0:3:17,97 --> 0:3:19,7
right photographer and shooting
with the wrong


79
0:3:19,7 --> 0:3:23,52
photographer, and not having
whatever to get to the next


80
0:3:23,52 --> 0:3:25,38
level, Josh had it all.


81
0:3:25,38 --> 0:3:27,3
It was something that you could
model yourself after.


82
0:3:27,3 --> 0:3:28,73
Like, damn, I want
to be like Josh.


83
0:3:28,73 --> 0:3:29,65
I want--


84
0:3:29,65 --> 0:3:31,11
I want to get the cover
of TransWorld.


85
0:3:31,11 --> 0:3:32,41
I want the DC this.


86
0:3:32,41 --> 0:3:34,85
I want-- you know, but you
gotta work for that shit.


87
0:3:34,85 --> 0:3:36,2
I was staying at Josh's house.


88
0:3:36,2 --> 0:3:36,83
And I was wildin' out.


89
0:3:36,83 --> 0:3:41,55
I was only 15, so I was wildin',
like throwing up,


90
0:3:41,55 --> 0:3:44,56
just spilling shit, getting
caught stealing and running


91
0:3:44,56 --> 0:3:45,32
back in the crib.


92
0:3:45,32 --> 0:3:46,64
Like just--


93
0:3:46,64 --> 0:3:47,65
just blowing the spot up.


94
0:3:47,65 --> 0:3:49,98
And then here comes
Lennie Kirk.


95
0:3:49,98 --> 0:3:51,86
I'd go into the crib and
like this new dude's


96
0:3:51,86 --> 0:3:52,615
sitting on a couch.


97
0:3:52,615 --> 0:3:54,6
And he's like, yo,
you gotta leave.


98
0:3:54,6 --> 0:3:56,1
I'm like, shit, I don't
gotta go nowhere.


99
0:3:56,1 --> 0:3:56,95
My man live here.


100
0:3:56,95 --> 0:3:58,816
And Josh was like, yeah,
you gotta leave.


101
0:3:58,816 --> 0:4:0,33
And I was like, wow.


102
0:4:0,33 --> 0:4:3,4
So it was a real big fuck
you to Lennie Kirk.


103
0:4:3,4 --> 0:4:7,8
But the powerful era that they
had wasn't about me.


104
0:4:7,8 --> 0:4:8,36
That's how I look at it now.


105
0:4:8,36 --> 0:4:11,42
It was like, he ran hard with
Lennie Kirk for a while.


106
0:4:11,42 --> 0:4:14,2
JOSH KALIS: Well, when the
Timecode came out, I didn't


107
0:4:14,2 --> 0:4:16,89
hang out with anybody but,
actually, Lennie.


108
0:4:16,89 --> 0:4:23,33



109
0:4:23,33 --> 0:4:28,2
Like me and Lennie were
roommates in San Francisco.


110
0:4:28,2 --> 0:4:29,16
And like, I love Lennie.


111
0:4:29,16 --> 0:4:31,8
Because Lennie is
crazy as shit.


112
0:4:31,8 --> 0:4:34,37
Before his Jesus stuff,
he was like so


113
0:4:34,37 --> 0:4:36,47
ghetto gangster, just--


114
0:4:36,47 --> 0:4:38,0
like we were two
peas in a pod.


115
0:4:38,0 --> 0:4:39,2
You know what I mean?


116
0:4:39,2 --> 0:4:42,45
He had his corn rows and his
camos, and I had my camos, and


117
0:4:42,45 --> 0:4:44,26
I mean, we just-- we
thought we were the


118
0:4:44,26 --> 0:4:45,52
hardest dudes ever.


119
0:4:45,52 --> 0:4:51,1
But Lennie would take it a
little bit further than me.


120
0:4:51,1 --> 0:4:54,3
ROB DYRDEK: You know, when
I think of Lennie, how he


121
0:4:54,3 --> 0:4:57,71
skates, I think of that one
photo where's he's grinding


122
0:4:57,71 --> 0:5:1,33
this ledge in between a pool,
where his arm is just so


123
0:5:1,33 --> 0:5:2,78
rocketed out.


124
0:5:2,78 --> 0:5:5,1
JOSH KALIS: Every time, his arm
would be looking like he


125
0:5:5,1 --> 0:5:6,19
was fucking punching the air.


126
0:5:6,19 --> 0:5:10,3
And I mean, he was just,
like, so dope.


127
0:5:10,3 --> 0:5:12,33
I loved how he skated.


128
0:5:12,33 --> 0:5:14,7
Like, I was jealous
a lot of times.


129
0:5:14,7 --> 0:5:16,28
Because I can't really
jump off shit like


130
0:5:16,28 --> 0:5:17,69
he could, you know?


131
0:5:17,69 --> 0:5:20,6
He could do the most tech shit,
or he could grind the


132
0:5:20,6 --> 0:5:21,85
most gnarliest shit.


133
0:5:21,85 --> 0:5:26,2



134
0:5:26,2 --> 0:5:28,57
MIKE BLABAC: With Lennie, he's
just such a rad dude to watch


135
0:5:28,57 --> 0:5:29,77
on a skateboard.


136
0:5:29,77 --> 0:5:33,12
That works out bad, that
grind-out drop thing.


137
0:5:33,12 --> 0:5:35,88
Like he had to literally pinned
himself against the


138
0:5:35,88 --> 0:5:38,63
door and like ran and fucking
threw his board down, and it


139
0:5:38,63 --> 0:5:39,87
was pretty raw.


140
0:5:39,87 --> 0:5:40,99
It was sick.


141
0:5:40,99 --> 0:5:43,33
I just remember thinking,
like, holy


142
0:5:43,33 --> 0:5:45,55
shit, this guy's insane.


143
0:5:45,55 --> 0:5:47,8
JAMIE THOMAS: I was always
a Lennie Kirk--


144
0:5:47,8 --> 0:5:49,7
I was always a fan
of his skating.


145
0:5:49,7 --> 0:5:52,15
His Timecode part, seriously
hands-down my


146
0:5:52,15 --> 0:5:52,89
favorite video part.


147
0:5:52,89 --> 0:5:54,53
It's definitely in
the top five.


148
0:5:54,53 --> 0:5:58,19
The song, the vibe, his whole
kit and that time was like


149
0:5:58,19 --> 0:5:59,15
untouchable.


150
0:5:59,15 --> 0:6:2,19
His skating was so
sick and so raw.


151
0:6:2,19 --> 0:6:4,93
It was like, I don't even know
if anybody's ever even come


152
0:6:4,93 --> 0:6:5,62
out that raw.


153
0:6:5,62 --> 0:6:7,18
Like maybe Train Wreck?


154
0:6:7,18 --> 0:6:8,42
Like maybe?


155
0:6:8,42 --> 0:6:12,23
It was that, like, uncut
and unfiltered.


156
0:6:12,23 --> 0:6:15,57
JOSH KALIS: Lennie's skating,
it was identical to his


157
0:6:15,57 --> 0:6:17,216
personality.


158
0:6:17,216 --> 0:6:19,31
RB UMALI: Oh, back in the day,
gangsta Lennie days?


159
0:6:19,31 --> 0:6:21,0
He would roll up with
like corn rows,


160
0:6:21,0 --> 0:6:22,15
blasting gangsta rap.


161
0:6:22,15 --> 0:6:23,0
And he had like--


162
0:6:23,0 --> 0:6:25,68
I know he had this bat in the
backseat of his car with like


163
0:6:25,68 --> 0:6:26,86
screws drilled into it.


164
0:6:26,86 --> 0:6:29,16
I think he really have had
like a spiked bat.


165
0:6:29,16 --> 0:6:31,305
Because I think he was listening
to Wu Tang, and he


166
0:6:31,305 --> 0:6:35,4
wanted to have a spiked bat.


167
0:6:35,4 --> 0:6:35,48
And yeah.


168
0:6:35,48 --> 0:6:38,31
Just driving around drunk,
going to house parties,


169
0:6:38,31 --> 0:6:39,41
starting fights.


170
0:6:39,41 --> 0:6:42,735
I remember this one fight broke
out in Houston, and they


171
0:6:42,735 --> 0:6:45,23
ended up going back with, like,
empty Snapple bottles


172
0:6:45,23 --> 0:6:48,17
they got from my
room and like--


173
0:6:48,17 --> 0:6:50,54
I think they torched the house
in the middle of the night.


174
0:6:50,54 --> 0:6:53,18



175
0:6:53,18 --> 0:6:55,65
JOSH KALIS: We were at Denny's
one time in San Diego.


176
0:6:55,65 --> 0:6:57,41
Some Marines were in there.


177
0:6:57,41 --> 0:6:58,21
So what's Lennie do?


178
0:6:58,21 --> 0:7:1,17
Like blah, blah, starts talking
all this shit to them.


179
0:7:1,17 --> 0:7:2,98
Marine starts talking shit.


180
0:7:2,98 --> 0:7:3,69
About ready to fight.


181
0:7:3,69 --> 0:7:6,29
Lennie reaches under his fucking
seat and pulls out a


182
0:7:6,29 --> 0:7:9,13
BB gun and cocks this BB
gun to this Marine.


183
0:7:9,13 --> 0:7:10,17
Like what's up now?


184
0:7:10,17 --> 0:7:11,9
Cocks a fucking BB gun.


185
0:7:11,9 --> 0:7:15,44
Well, here comes the Marine,
grabs a hammer, like a real


186
0:7:15,44 --> 0:7:18,62
hammer, not like a fucking gun
hammer, and fucking bashes


187
0:7:18,62 --> 0:7:22,21
Lennie's car, punches
him in the face.


188
0:7:22,21 --> 0:7:24,57
And here come all eight
Marines out the thing.


189
0:7:24,57 --> 0:7:25,29
Lennie!


190
0:7:25,29 --> 0:7:26,8
Let's fucking go, dude.


191
0:7:26,8 --> 0:7:27,87
But he was just like that.


192
0:7:27,87 --> 0:7:29,93
Always drawing attention.


193
0:7:29,93 --> 0:7:31,38
And then he hit his head.


194
0:7:31,38 --> 0:7:33,97
And like, smoked weed,
and tripped out, and


195
0:7:33,97 --> 0:7:35,38
fucking found God.


196
0:7:35,38 --> 0:7:38,85
LENNIE KIRK: Ask Jesus to
forgive your sins always.


197
0:7:38,85 --> 0:7:39,76
Pray always.


198
0:7:39,76 --> 0:7:41,58
Get to know the Lord.


199
0:7:41,58 --> 0:7:44,5
Study and obey the Bible.


200
0:7:44,5 --> 0:7:45,6
Quit sinning.


201
0:7:45,6 --> 0:7:46,63
Escape hell.


202
0:7:46,63 --> 0:7:48,14
JAMIE THOMAS: I've told that
story so many times.


203
0:7:48,14 --> 0:7:50,76
It's always a good one
to tell in vans, the


204
0:7:50,76 --> 0:7:51,67
story of Lennie Kirk.


205
0:7:51,67 --> 0:7:55,57
Basically what happened
to Lennie, you know?


206
0:7:55,57 --> 0:7:58,9
JOSH KALIS: Well, I wasn't there
when you grinded the


207
0:7:58,9 --> 0:8:0,62
dumpster and fell back
and smacked his head.


208
0:8:0,62 --> 0:8:6,23
But that's not what made
him turn to religion.


209
0:8:6,23 --> 0:8:8,54
Either a few days before or a
few days after that, he got


210
0:8:8,54 --> 0:8:10,58
ran over by a Pacific
Bell truck.


211
0:8:10,58 --> 0:8:13,73
Like full-on from his ankle
all the way up.


212
0:8:13,73 --> 0:8:15,2
And he didn't break a bone.


213
0:8:15,2 --> 0:8:17,47
And it was in front
of mad skaters.


214
0:8:17,47 --> 0:8:23,28
Then a couple days after that,
he was skating across Haight


215
0:8:23,28 --> 0:8:26,88
Street, and this Jeep like,
beep, honked the horn at him.


216
0:8:26,88 --> 0:8:28,72
And he must've ran the
light or something.


217
0:8:28,72 --> 0:8:30,19
The guy in the Jeep was
like, hey, boy,


218
0:8:30,19 --> 0:8:31,916
don't you see the light?


219
0:8:31,916 --> 0:8:33,52
And he was like, don't I
fucking see the light?


220
0:8:33,52 --> 0:8:34,659
Like, whatever.


221
0:8:34,659 --> 0:8:35,61
Skate around.


222
0:8:35,61 --> 0:8:37,87
And then that night, he was
hanging out with some chick


223
0:8:37,87 --> 0:8:39,11
and he was smoking weed.


224
0:8:39,11 --> 0:8:41,73
And I guess, he was telling me
that he was thinking about the


225
0:8:41,73 --> 0:8:43,14
dude in the Jeep.


226
0:8:43,14 --> 0:8:44,56
Don't you see the light?


227
0:8:44,56 --> 0:8:46,4
And fucking bam.


228
0:8:46,4 --> 0:8:49,43
Like, he said he went sober,
kicked the chick out, and then


229
0:8:49,43 --> 0:8:54,2
all that psychoness that he
had went into religion.


230
0:8:54,2 --> 0:8:56,59
And next thing you know, before
every time he tried a


231
0:8:56,59 --> 0:8:59,22
trick, he'd open up the Bible,
read a verse, and that was


232
0:8:59,22 --> 0:9:1,33
going to be the outcome
of the trick.


233
0:9:1,33 --> 0:9:6,93
In Timecode he 50-50 grinds this
long ledge, it's on the


234
0:9:6,93 --> 0:9:10,46
top of a parking ramp and it
goes flat, and then he pops


235
0:9:10,46 --> 0:9:11,33
off onto the sidewalk.


236
0:9:11,33 --> 0:9:15,77
And while we were skating that
thing, he fucking grinds, his


237
0:9:15,77 --> 0:9:18,57
front truck comes off and he
falls backwards and rolls and


238
0:9:18,57 --> 0:9:18,905
[CLAP]


239
0:9:18,905 --> 0:9:19,24
whap!


240
0:9:19,24 --> 0:9:20,99
I mean, he smacks his
head so hard.


241
0:9:20,99 --> 0:9:22,84
So I run over there to see if
he's all right and he's


242
0:9:22,84 --> 0:9:24,95
praying and he's asking for
forgiveness and he's


243
0:9:24,95 --> 0:9:26,36
apologizing.


244
0:9:26,36 --> 0:9:28,24
And when he was done praying,
I'm like, yo, dude.


245
0:9:28,24 --> 0:9:29,72
Like what are you praying?


246
0:9:29,72 --> 0:9:31,53
What are you apologizing for?


247
0:9:31,53 --> 0:9:36,0
He was like, man, I jerked off
this morning and that's my


248
0:9:36,0 --> 0:9:36,79
punishment.


249
0:9:36,79 --> 0:9:40,62
So we'd start watching the
footage on the camera, and


250
0:9:40,62 --> 0:9:41,87
he's like, you see that?


251
0:9:41,87 --> 0:9:42,51
You see that?


252
0:9:42,51 --> 0:9:46,62
Like he swore that he could see
God's hand come down and


253
0:9:46,62 --> 0:9:48,94
boom, mush his head
into the ground.


254
0:9:48,94 --> 0:9:51,8
And I was like, get the fuck
out of here, right?


255
0:9:51,8 --> 0:9:53,83
And I had to deal with that
every day until I just had to


256
0:9:53,83 --> 0:9:56,17
like completely separate
myself.


257
0:9:56,17 --> 0:9:57,98
If you are wearing-- like
for me, I would


258
0:9:57,98 --> 0:9:59,5
be wearing a necklace.


259
0:9:59,5 --> 0:10:0,81
And he'd be like,
yo, Kalis, dude.


260
0:10:0,81 --> 0:10:1,48
You're going to hell.


261
0:10:1,48 --> 0:10:3,15
You gon' burn in hell for
wearing that necklace.


262
0:10:3,15 --> 0:10:4,57
You representin' a female.


263
0:10:4,57 --> 0:10:8,68
ROB DYRDEK: It was the most
cockamamie jibber-jabbish.


264
0:10:8,68 --> 0:10:10,33
Like he spoke in tongues.


265
0:10:10,33 --> 0:10:14,16
It was so all over
the crazy map.


266
0:10:14,16 --> 0:10:17,79
I had this argument with them
about Hubba Hideout and how he


267
0:10:17,79 --> 0:10:20,2
was going to switch back
tail it, even though


268
0:10:20,2 --> 0:10:21,145
Kalis already did.


269
0:10:21,145 --> 0:10:22,98
And I'm like, you
can't do that.


270
0:10:22,98 --> 0:10:24,5
He's like, it don't matter.


271
0:10:24,5 --> 0:10:25,55
It doesn't matter.


272
0:10:25,55 --> 0:10:26,84
I'm like, you can't.


273
0:10:26,84 --> 0:10:30,27
So he was doing a sermon
for this church.


274
0:10:30,27 --> 0:10:32,68
There was probably
300 people there.


275
0:10:32,68 --> 0:10:35,77
He's just, you know, like, and I
walk, I was in the gutter, I


276
0:10:35,77 --> 0:10:36,67
was a [INAUDIBLE]


277
0:10:36,67 --> 0:10:37,83
days.


278
0:10:37,83 --> 0:10:38,68
He's going, he's like--


279
0:10:38,68 --> 0:10:41,612
And I don't, I don't care
who did what on what


280
0:10:41,612 --> 0:10:42,89
ledge or who did--


281
0:10:42,89 --> 0:10:46,7
I'm like, it turned into where
he was focusing in on me.


282
0:10:46,7 --> 0:10:49,2
Like in the middle of the
sermon, he just somehow


283
0:10:49,2 --> 0:10:52,36
twitched into the memory of
having the argument of a trick


284
0:10:52,36 --> 0:10:53,47
already being done.


285
0:10:53,47 --> 0:10:56,26
He got fixated on like a young
girl, like in a tight top,


286
0:10:56,26 --> 0:10:58,815
like, and you're dressing around
like a whore, coming


287
0:10:58,815 --> 0:11:0,65
around, acting like a whore.


288
0:11:0,65 --> 0:11:3,12
And you think you can come
around putting your body--


289
0:11:3,12 --> 0:11:5,4
I had to get up, be
like, yo, dude.


290
0:11:5,4 --> 0:11:6,1
Yo.


291
0:11:6,1 --> 0:11:6,96
And he's just, like, uh!


292
0:11:6,96 --> 0:11:8,29
And people were saying to
me, I can't believe


293
0:11:8,29 --> 0:11:9,17
that didn't move you.


294
0:11:9,17 --> 0:11:10,74
And I'm like, what?


295
0:11:10,74 --> 0:11:12,56
None of it even made sense.


296
0:11:12,56 --> 0:11:16,7
Like the guy was just like, it's
like it was so crazy, in


297
0:11:16,7 --> 0:11:18,14
they were just like, aaahhh.


298
0:11:18,14 --> 0:11:21,45
JAMIE THOMAS: He has some pretty
heavy mental stability


299
0:11:21,45 --> 0:11:24,68
issues that far outweigh
anything he wants to do.


300
0:11:24,68 --> 0:11:25,94
You know what I mean?


301
0:11:25,94 --> 0:11:28,56
He could want to be someone, but
he's mentally not capable


302
0:11:28,56 --> 0:11:30,62
of being the person
he wants to be.


303
0:11:30,62 --> 0:11:32,32
And I think that that--


304
0:11:32,32 --> 0:11:34,9
I mean, it's like, how
do you avoid that?


305
0:11:34,9 --> 0:11:36,72
Basically, I don't know if
Carter was the dude who was


306
0:11:36,72 --> 0:11:38,17
helping Lennie, or
who was the dude.


307
0:11:38,17 --> 0:11:42,52
But somebody was giving Lennie
a temporary platform to be--


308
0:11:42,52 --> 0:11:45,99
like have a normal
life for a while.


309
0:11:45,99 --> 0:11:49,75
And then once that kind of
crumbled or fell apart, or he


310
0:11:49,75 --> 0:11:52,42
burned the bridge, then he was
out there on his own again,


311
0:11:52,42 --> 0:11:53,46
left to his own devices.


312
0:11:53,46 --> 0:11:57,3
And we all saw where
that went.


313
0:11:57,3 --> 0:11:59,28
ROB DYRDEK: It just became one
of those things, that like he


314
0:11:59,28 --> 0:12:2,59
really never skated after
Timecode, really ever again.


315
0:12:2,59 --> 0:12:6,72
Not only was he just being so
focused on all things God and


316
0:12:6,72 --> 0:12:11,15
preaching and being in the
streets preaching, that


317
0:12:11,15 --> 0:12:14,0
eventually they just,
they had no choice.


318
0:12:14,0 --> 0:12:18,19
JOSH KALIS: I mean, in his
brain, he is 100% right.


319
0:12:18,19 --> 0:12:19,47
You know what I mean?


320
0:12:19,47 --> 0:12:22,34
I heard he was robbing
old ladies in Frisco.


321
0:12:22,34 --> 0:12:24,28
So I'll call him up, Lennie,
what are you doing, dude?


322
0:12:24,28 --> 0:12:25,0
Robbing old ladies?


323
0:12:25,0 --> 0:12:26,74
And he was like, man,
it's tough times.


324
0:12:26,74 --> 0:12:29,1
The Lord said it
was all right.


325
0:12:29,1 --> 0:12:29,51
I was like, wow.


326
0:12:29,51 --> 0:12:32,82
And it was shortly after that is
when he got busted robbing


327
0:12:32,82 --> 0:12:36,54
that taxi cab driver, and
off to prison he went.


328
0:12:36,54 --> 0:12:37,47
I mean, I don't know
the whole story.


329
0:12:37,47 --> 0:12:40,32
I just heard all the rumors
about him walking around Pier


330
0:12:40,32 --> 0:12:44,9
7 with a shotgun in his
pants, you know?


331
0:12:44,9 --> 0:12:46,81
No, he got out after
a few years.


332
0:12:46,81 --> 0:12:48,74
And I actually went to
Frisco and skated


333
0:12:48,74 --> 0:12:50,5
with him for a week.


334
0:12:50,5 --> 0:12:51,25
Every day.


335
0:12:51,25 --> 0:12:52,19
And he was killing it.


336
0:12:52,19 --> 0:12:55,4
Like, there's sick footage
right now of Lennie board


337
0:12:55,4 --> 0:12:58,665
sliding this flat rail.


338
0:12:58,665 --> 0:13:0,75
It was awesome skating
with him.


339
0:13:0,75 --> 0:13:3,44
And next thing I know, I
got a phone call from


340
0:13:3,44 --> 0:13:4,44
San Francisco jail.


341
0:13:4,44 --> 0:13:5,11
Like, hey, man.


342
0:13:5,11 --> 0:13:8,0
And I need $20 grand
for this lawyer.


343
0:13:8,0 --> 0:13:8,89
I'm like, what are you
doing in there?


344
0:13:8,89 --> 0:13:11,4
He's like, I got seven
charges, man.


345
0:13:11,4 --> 0:13:13,6
Allegedly it was like kidnapping
and some other


346
0:13:13,6 --> 0:13:14,21
crazy shit.


347
0:13:14,21 --> 0:13:15,154
I don't know.


348
0:13:15,154 --> 0:13:16,404
It was pretty wild.


349
0:13:16,404 --> 0:13:21,94



350
0:13:21,94 --> 0:13:24,37
ROB DYRDEK: After he first
went to jail, it was on


351
0:13:24,37 --> 0:13:25,73
September 10.


352
0:13:25,73 --> 0:13:27,39
So he kept calling me
over and over from


353
0:13:27,39 --> 0:13:29,3
jail, like, see, Rob?


354
0:13:29,3 --> 0:13:31,52
I told you God just
put me in jail.


355
0:13:31,52 --> 0:13:34,44
The end times are here, the
end times are here.


356
0:13:34,44 --> 0:13:38,49
And this would have been
September 10, 2001.


357
0:13:38,49 --> 0:13:40,25
The next day, 9/11 happened.


358
0:13:40,25 --> 0:13:42,75
So he was like, for sure, the
end of the world, God put him


359
0:13:42,75 --> 0:13:44,31
in jail because of that.


360
0:13:44,31 --> 0:13:46,96
And it was like, it was
pretty ridiculous.


361
0:13:46,96 --> 0:13:49,376
But the crazy thing, too, is
he went-- now he's like a


362
0:13:49,376 --> 0:13:50,32
vato, you know what
I'm saying?


363
0:13:50,32 --> 0:13:52,8
Now he's like a Mexican
gangster.


364
0:13:52,8 --> 0:13:53,28
Like, have you ever
seen his MySpace?


365
0:13:53,28 --> 0:13:54,53
PATRICK O'DELL: No.


366
0:13:54,53 --> 0:13:56,54



367
0:13:56,54 --> 0:13:56,87
ROB DYRDEK: Wow.


368
0:13:56,87 --> 0:13:58,914
Where it's like, La Vida Loco,
and it's like, (IN VATO


369
0:13:58,914 --> 0:14:0,7
ACCENT) Fuck all, fuck all the
bitches and my vida, my


370
0:14:0,7 --> 0:14:2,2
bitches and my loco--
like, whatever.


371
0:14:2,2 --> 0:14:5,47
It looks like a Spanish
gangbanger's MySpace page.


372
0:14:5,47 --> 0:14:6,72
It's incredible.


373
0:14:6,72 --> 0:16:6,72
