###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Want to kick off today with a big hello to the students and teachers
###4 at JC Booth (ph) in Peach Tree City, Georgia. Really enjoyed meeting with you on Friday.
###10 Delivering the Monday edition of CNN STUDENT NEWS to you and classrooms all over the world,
###15 I`m Carl Azuz.
###29 New York City subway, closed. The New Jersey bus and rail service, shut down. We just got
###35 word that almost 2 million public school students are out today, and it`s all because of this
###40 massive storm system named Sandy. On Sunday, it was a Category 1 hurricane. A lot of times
###46 with these storms, forecasters focus on the center and where and when it might land. With
###51 Sandy, one expert said it might not matter where the center is, because the entire thing
###56 is so large. And things could get worse. There`s a cold front coming from the western part
###61 of the U.S. If that meets up with Sandy and the two weather systems merge together, it
###66 could have a severe impact on the East Coast.
###69 Sandy is already being blamed for at least 60 deaths from when it moved through the Caribbean.
###74 Yesterday it was off the coast of North Carolina and moving north. Predictions estimated that
###79 Delaware, Maryland and Virginia could get up to a foot of rain.
###83 Governors all over the northeast declared states of emergency to help make resources
###87 and money available to prepare for this storm.
###90 Our next headline takes us all the way across North America to Canada`s British Colombia.
###95 An earthquake, and a pretty big one, hit there on Saturday. And no major damage was reported,
###100 but the quake`s potential impact, where the quake had threatened reached across the Pacific
###105 Ocean out to the Hawaiian islands.
###110 The sirens in this Youtube video are letting people know about a tsunami warning. The concern
###117 was that the quake in Canada would trigger a large ocean wave that would wash up in Hawaii.
###122 Now, that didn`t happen, and the tsunami warning was canceled after a few hours.
###127 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? In order to be U.S. president, you have to be at least
###134 45 years old. Not true. There is an age requirement, but it`s not 45. Presidents have to be at
###142 least 35.
###144 AZUZ: Well, of course this year`s presidential candidates meet that constitutional requirement.
###152 Barack Obama is 51, Mitt Romney is 65. With the election just eight days away, we wanted
###158 to share a little more about the men running for the Oval Office. Both of them are family
###162 men. Romney and his wife Ann have five sons. Obama and his wife Michelle have two daughters.
###168 If you look back at where they went to school, they started at almost opposite sides of the
###172 country. Obama went to college at Columbia University; Romney graduated from Brigham
###177 Young. One thing they have in common: both men have degrees from Harvard Law School.
###182 Romney also has a degree from Harvard Business School.
###185 How about prior work experience? Mitt Romney helped found an investment company called
###189 Bain Capital. He also helped organize and run the 2002 Winter Olympics, and he served
###195 as governor of Massachusetts.
###197 Barack Obama worked as a community organizer in Chicago. He served two terms in the Illinois
###202 State Senate, and he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004.
###206 This is the second time that both men have run for president. They were candidates in
###210 2008 as well, and they both made some history along the way. In 2008, Barack Obama became
###216 the first African-American presidential nominee for a major political party, and this year,
###221 Mitt Romney became the first Mormon to be a major political party`s presidential nominee.
###227 President Obama and Governor Romney are both aiming for the same number -- 270. If you
###233 want to win the presidency, that`s at least how many votes you need to get in the electoral
###237 college. Jonathan Mann explains how that works and what it could take for the candidates
###241 to reach that magic number.
###243 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###243 JONATHAN MANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s nice to be popular, but it does not win the White
###248 House. The national poll numbers show that more people prefer Mitt Romney lately, but
###252 winning the presidency is not a popularity contest. You have to win states, not just
###257 votes. And for Romney, that`s a problem. Even though the poll numbers are moving his way,
###261 the color-coded CNN electoral map has barely budged in months, and it speaks volumes. It
###266 still projects that Obama is leading in the electoral vote with the blue states, comfortably
###272 in his corner. Romney`s safe states are in red. Each state has a different number of
###277 electoral votes, though, based on its population. And the thing is that whoever wins 270 electoral
###282 votes will win the election.
###284 That`s why the yellow states, the tossup states are crucial. Polls in those states show the
###289 race is still too close to call. Romney`s problem is that he needs to win most of them.
###295 Just this week, North Carolina turned light red, showing that the state is now in the
###299 leaning Romney category. Romney has a slight edge in Florida, so we`ll be turning that
###304 state red as well. He has high hopes for Virginia and for Colorado. If they turn red too, he
###309 is still, though, 13 electoral votes short of the 270 he needs to win. He`d have to win
###315 two more of the smaller states, or the big prize, Ohio, to win the election.
###319 Now, resetting the map, there is more wiggle room in Obama`s path to the presidency. His
###324 campaign is setting its sights on Iowa, Wisconsin and all- important Ohio. Those three states
###329 alone could put him over the top. Any other wins would just be extra insurance. But say
###334 Obama wins Ohio and Wisconsin, and loses Iowa. Well, he wins New Hampshire, Romney wins the
###340 rest. Each candidate ends up with 269 electoral votes, a tie. That hasn`t happened in more
###346 than 200 years, but it could, and if it did, the newly elected House of Representatives
###352 would actually be the ones to vote to break the tie.
###354 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###355 AZUZ: A tie for president. That might sound unbelievable, but it has happened before,
###360 and it`s something we`re going to look into more later on this week, so please keep watching.
###365 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can ID me. I was established in 1789. I lead one branch
###374 of the U.S. government. I have one chief and eight associates, who can serve as members
###380 for the rest of their lives.
###384 I`m the U.S. Supreme Court, to which thousands of cases are filed each year.
###390 AZUZ: So let`s say you`re a college student, you`re looking for ways to help pay for tuition,
###397 and you come up with a plan to buy some stuff and then sell it to make some money. Sounds
###402 simple, but it might not turn out that way. It`s the starting point for a case that the
###406 Supreme Court is about to hear, and as Joe Johns explains, the decision could go a lot
###411 further than just college campuses.
###413 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###413 JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s a case that could cause trouble for anyone who ever
###418 thought about selling an old iPhone or iPad, donating clothes to charity, or even unloading
###424 junk at a yard sale. The issue about to be argued before the Supreme Court is whether
###429 the original copyright holder on U.S. products manufactured or purchased in other countries
###434 can control your ability to resell the product once you buy it.
###440 Davis Klyonaga resells old products at this eBay consignment store.
###444 (on camera): How much of this stuff is foreign manufactured?
###446 DAVIS KLYONAGA, OWNER, DROP & SHIP: I`d probably say 85, 95 percent.
###450 JOHNS: He fears the case could put him out of business.
###453 KLYONAGA: I think it`s ridiculous. I mean, I have known about it because it could affect
###458 my business so horribly, but I kind of pushed it back, because I`m like, how could this
###462 possibly happen? The repercussions would be ridiculous.
###465 JOHNS: Even libraries are worried that a legal defeat could require them to seek the copyright
###470 owner`s permission before lending books printed overseas.
###474 Andrew Shore represents a coalition of interests, including libraries.
###478 ANDREW SHORE, ATTORNEY: The rule we`d like to see is very simple. You bought it, you
###482 own it, and you could do with it as you please.
###484 JOHNS: Otherwise, Shore says, copyright owners could demand a fee every time you try to resell
###489 almost anything not made in America.
###491 (on camera): Anything I`m wearing, would that apply?
###493 SHORE: It`s got a copyright.
###494 JOHNS: Right. DVDs?
###495 SHORE: Yes.
###496 JOHNS: What else? Iphones?
###498 SHORE: Iphones.
###499 JOHNS: Computers.
###499 SHORE: Yes.
###500 JOHNS: Televisions?
###501 SHORE: Yes.
###502 JOHNS: Cars?
###503 SHORE: Yes.
###504 JOHNS: Jewelry?
###504 SHORE: Everything with copyright.
###506 JOHNS (VOICE-OVER): The copyright`s holders and their lawyers say the rhetoric has gotten
###510 a little overheated.
###510 THEODORE OLSON, LAWYER FOR PLAINTIFF: You know that you`re on the right side of the
###513 case when the other side, the best answer that they can come up with is that the sky
###517 is going to fall. Garage sales, museums, and that sort of thing, none of that is going
###521 to happen.
###522 JOHNS: Powerhouse attorney Ted Olson says this is mostly about books and movies and
###526 other so-called intellectual properties, and making sure producers of such works have exclusive
###532 rights to distribute them in the U.S.
###534 OLSON: It is protecting the integrity of the copyright system in the United States, which
###540 was created by the Constitution in order to create an incentive for people to create works
###546 that make us all laugh or cry or educate us.
###548 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###549 AZUZ: Finally today, there are times I`m very glad I do most of my reporting from a studio,
###554 because the field presents perils, like when this fish flaps and the field correspondent
###559 freaks. Only problem, her backup`s balance. But it is more or less embarrassing than what`s
###566 about to happen to this reporter. The problem with being out in the air is the birds, and
###569 one of them just dropped a present on the reporter`s shoulder. That`s just a sign of
###575 disrespect. You word hard, toil at your job, and then a bird does something to foul it
###580 up. If we keep this up, this show is going down the tubes, so we`ll see you tomorrow
###583 on CNN STUDENT NEWS.
