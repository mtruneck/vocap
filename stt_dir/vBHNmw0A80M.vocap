###168 LELE SAVERI: At the beginning of 2008, world news outlets
###171 were flooded with images of garbage piles in
###173 the streets of Naples.
###175 The newly reelected premier, Silvio Berlusconi, made
###179 countless TV appearances, personally picking up trash
###182 and promising to resolve the situation.
###185 Naples and the entire Campania region had been officially
###188 declared an environmental crisis over 14 years ago.
###191 The garbage piles were just a current distraction from the
###194 real emergency--
###196 almost 8 million tons of rubbish stockpiled throughout
###198 the region, illegal toxic waste dumps, a serious human
###202 health crisis.
###203 And behind it all, the largest criminal organization in
###206 Italy, the Neapolitan Camorra.
###207 
###210 We're in Naples now, and we're about to meet Michele Buonomo,
###215 who's the president of Legambiente Campania.
###218 Legambiente's the most important
###220 environmental-protection group.

###409 LELE SAVERI: They're doing this protest because they want
###411 to fill up this empty space in a mountain with just rubbish,
###416 without doing anything to them, not burning or nothing.

###545 LUIGI MONTANO: Ciao.
###546 LELE SAVERI: Hi.

###1357 LELE SAVERI: We're standing right on top of the highest
###1360 legal garbage dump in Campania.

###1369 [EXHALES HEAVILY]
###1371 It stinks really bad.

###1639 LELE SAVERI: That is ridiculous.
###1641 
###1644 This is a joke.
###1646 We're not allowed in.
###1647 We need to have an interview there.
###1649 We'll be late for the interview.
###1651 But we're not allowed to go through the main square of
###1654 Naples, because Cavalieri Berlusconi made the head of
###1657 the state-- and to go across from that building to that
###1659 building to have our press conference.
###1663 So they decide to stop everything.
###1664 The guys just told us that the only way of going to the other
###1668 side to have this interview would be to go all the way
###1671 around the city.
###1671 It would take us about 40 minutes to walk around for a
###1675 one minute walk, just to have a press conference and tell
###1680 everyone who's going to deal with the rubbish.
###1682 
###1685 Quite bizarre.
