###1 Expert with a knife will always take a man with a gun
###3 within 20 feet, always, on the draw.
###6 You won't draw leather on your nine Glock before I draw
###9 leather on my knife and kill you.
###11 Simple fact.
###12 
###16 I mean, you're not going to pull it out straight out.
###22 That's in there.
###24 You're going to lean on that.
###26 You're not going to do it.
###28 That's how deep it goes in.
###30 And that's a Bowie.
###32 That against any man would've been dead.
###33 He'd have been dead already.
###36 That's a lot of knife coming on you.
###38 
###57 I have two sides.
###58 I have no middle ground.
###59 I am pure light and pure darkness.
###61 I cry for people in the streets.
###62 I hate poverty.
###64 I hate children that don't eat.
###65 It drives me crazy.
###67 It breaks my heart to see children suffer.
###69 I love people.
###70 Walk on the wrong way--
###72 yeah, I'm one dark bastard.
###73 
###77 I didn't choose when I got attacked.
###79 The only thing experts agree on is-- with a black
###81 bear, you never run.
###83 A black bear, you never play dead.
###84 A black bear, you always show aggression.
###86 This is 100% of the time.
###88 Not so with a grizzly.
###89 Your best chance, if it's a female, you see the cub or
###91 not, yeah, play dead.
###92 Whether it was my martial arts.
###93 Whether it's just--
###94 I'm one pissy son of a bitch.
###96 I don't know.
###96 I don't know anything about grizzlies back then.
###98 I'm still a teenager, you know?
###99 And I can feel the sense for days, you know?
###103 It's quiet.
###103 It's a stillness.
###106 I look at this grizzly.
###108 And then he just moves in on me-- just smash,
###110 right in the chest.
###112 All of sudden, something hits me.
###114 One of my senseis said, there will come a time in an
###116 individual's life where anger supersedes fear.
###121 And that's when you stand or fall.
###124 And it was beautiful, it really was.
###127 Just let the knapsack go, looked at this animal, and
###130 said, piss on you.
###132 It ain't going to happen.
###134 I had my Bowie, and I had a machete.
###139 And I walked up to him.
###141 I said, man, your fighting prowess is 50 times mine.
###144 But pal, I'm good enough to stick both these in you.
###146 And he just gave me that look, and his head kind of
###148 went back and forth.
###150 And he turned 180 degrees, and he was just gone.
###154 I just watched him walk off.
###156 And it was almost a-- oh man, the stillness, the quiet was
###159 unbelievable.
###160 You see, that's the wilderness.
###161 That's what brings us.
###163 You can get those-- it's like, wow, OK, this is cool.
###165 This is what it's all about.
###167 
###169 So I wanted to learn more about this bear.
###170 I wanted to know why.
###172 I went back to college.
###174 I had quit in grade 10.
###175 So I had to go upgrading all over again.
###177 And what I found out, there was not a damn thing known on
###179 the grizzly.
###180 You can't get close enough to study them.
###182 They'd kill you.
###183 Well, I'm watching RoboCop.
###186 And I'm telling you, halfway through that movie, it just
###188 all came together.
###189 I just looked at that and said, that's it.
###193 You give me the time and the money, I'm
###194 going to build a suit.
###195 That's how it all started.
###196 
###217 1987-88, I watched Robocop, I started building the bear
###220 suits for grizzly bear research.
###222 I am the world's foremost authority on deterrent sprays
###225 sold to the public.
###227 So I started building it-- the Mark III, the Mark IV.
###230 It's all soft material for flexibility.
###233 You learn a lot, 25 years at this.
###234 I mean, I've got 25 years ahead of anybody out there.
###237 And by the time I got to the M VII, you're looking at
###239 $150,000, straight titanium.
###244 Again, only about 20% flexibility, 135 pounds.
###251 But I only need to be able to stand there, raise the arm.
###254 There's a trigger device that sends off the spray.
###256 That's the research I do--
###258 and in aggressive behavioral research, what happens
###260 afterwards, if it gets through, what
###262 does the bear do.
###263 
###268 [INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
###271 Troy goes to McMaster University.
###273 That's our MIT.
###275 And I go to doctors in physics.
###277 So I present the problem to them, and they love it.
###280 Wow, that's brilliant.
###281 Wow, how do we simulate the power of a grizzly?
###284 OK, let's break this down.
###285 After two days' research, they look at me, and they say, OK,
###287 here's what you've got to do.
###289 If you can handle that pickup truck, dead impact, at 50
###294 kilometers an hour--
###295 got no problem with a bear.
###297 Well, they see that and assume, what an idiot.
###300 Jumped in the suit-- no, buddy, that's four years.
###304 That's five suits, starting at 3 kilometers an hour, pop.
###308 8 kilometers an hour, pop.
###311 15 kilometers an hour, pop.
###312 All the way up to 50 before I got there.
###314 Do you know why I never broke a bone?
###315 Do you know why I've never sustained so much as a
###318 concussion?
###319 Because I know what I'm doing.
###321 People, this isn't a big reach.
###323 I don't want to get hurt.
###324 So you're talking three years and another four suits later
###327 before we got to the M VI.
###328 And that's how it does it.
###329
