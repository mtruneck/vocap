###20 BASIM USMANI: While we were filming in Karachi, our shoot
###23 took one dark turn after another.
###25 Things just got heavier and heavier.
###28 But we met one person in the midst of all this chaos that
###30 gave us hope.
###32 His name is Abdul Sattar Edhi.
###34 And he is to Karachi what Mother Teresa was to the poor
###37 of Calcutta.
###38 As the founder of the Edhi Foundation, the largest
###41 welfare organization in Pakistan, he's opened over 300
###44 centers across the country, run by more than 3,500
###47 workers, plus thousands of volunteers, providing medical
###50 aid, family planning, and emergency assistance.
###54 The Edhi Foundation has also made donations towards
###56 disaster relief around the world, including to victims of
###59 Hurricane Katrina in the US.
###62 They rely entirely on donations, and avoid political
###64 or religious affiliation.
###67 We got a chance to meet with this living legend in Karachi.
###71 Edhi is one of the most important
###73 public figures in Pakistan.
###74 But recently there were reports that he was being
###76 targeted by the Taliban.
###78 So now, against his own wishes, he has round the clock
###81 police security.

###263 BASIM USMANI: Once word got out that Edhi had arrived in
###265 Lyari for a visit, hundreds of locals came out
###268 to pay their respects.
###269 And it's no wonder.
###270 Edhi's like a superhero, and he's incorruptible.
###273 While we were in Karachi, he was the only person who gave
###276 us hope for this city.
