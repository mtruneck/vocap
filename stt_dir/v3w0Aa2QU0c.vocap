###3 -We actually came specifically from Ohio for spring break.
###8 MATT: When you come from Tennessee, Georgia, South
###11 Carolina, any Southern state, Daytona Beach might as well be
###14 the south of France for these people.
###15 SEAN BISHOP: The way I've always described Daytona Beach
###17 to people is it reminds me of somebody who fell in love with
###20 a hooker and is trying to turn her into a lady.
###22 She's always going to be a whore.
###23 
###40 On a good spring break night, we'll have well over 100 girls
###43 dancing here.
###43 NADIA: By the time midnight hits, this place is crazy.
###46 SEAN BISHOP: At first, when we started letting the spring
###48 breakers in, the girls looked at them like they were a bunch
###50 of young kids without any money until they find out they
###53 were spending money.
###54 And now they embrace it.
###55 And the unique thing about it is if you look at the age
###57 group, our average dancer is a girl in her
###60 young 20s, late teens.
###61 NADIA: I've had girls say they've walked out of here
###63 with $2,000.
###64 I mean, crazy, off-the-hook amounts.
###67 What happens in Daytona stays in Daytona.
###69 
###77 DAVE: Daytona is just the Vegas of Florida, because it's
###81 so trashy as it is that people come down here for spring
###84 break, leave all their morals at home.
###86 
###90 SEAN BISHOP: You go to bed one night, and you wake up and
###92 there's an extra 200,000 people in town.
###94 So the place just explodes.
###95 
###100 MATT: It's just a bunch of people who came to one place
###103 with good weather to just get hammered and have sex.
###106 RANDY PHILLIPS: Dirtona Beach, man.
###107 That's the name that sticks.
###109 That is Dirtona.
###110 
###117 MATT: If you spend five minutes in a hotel room during
###121 spring break, you have to wonder all the atrocities that
###124 are going on.
###125 All the hotel room doors are open.
###126 There's a beer bong in every room, people having sex as
###129 loudly as possible, belongings everywhere.
###131 Like people just left their shit, and
###133 they're down on the beach.
###134 There could be a whale that just washed up on the beach
###137 and is decaying and smells like shit.
###139 If there's people around it, they'll flock to it and
###141 they'll get hammered by it.
###142 RANDY PHILLIPS: These two girls were totally going at it
###145 right on one of my mop sinks.
###146 And I literally walked in.
###147 I was like, are you women serious?
###148 Do you realize what I put in that sink?
###151 And they're totally going to town on each other.
###153 MATT: The sweetest girls back home are the
###156 craziest girls down here.
###160 You could definitely have at least two girls every night.
###162 SEAN BISHOP: The whole "Girls Gone Wild" thing started here
###164 in Daytona Beach, Florida.
###166 I mean, if you look at it, it is the perfect environment.
###168 MATT: These girls don't care what's going on.
###170 You can pass them to your buddies even though they know
###172 what has happened.
###173 
###177 DAVE: It's a really great town to be a drug dealer, because
###181 everyone's on drugs.
###182 Everyone's a customer.
###184 As a spring breaker in Daytona Beach, you're looking to get
###187 those things that you don't think you can get at home.
###189 Recently, it has been more meth, ecstasy, coke.
###193 Pills are really big now.
###195 And the pills are cheap down here, so they know
###197 they can get them.
###198 Mostly you can sell them whatever you want.
###201 Ripping them off is real easy.
###202 Quality doesn't have to be there.
###204 Sometimes you can just take the money and run.
###206 Sometimes you can give them a bad bag, a lot of cut, bad
###211 weed, tell them it's good weed.
###212 Hook them real easy, because they don't have a lot of
###215 options when they're on vacation.
###216 
###225 SCOTT EDWARDS: Fifteen or 20 years ago, spring break would
###228 bring about $100 million into this economy.
###230 We have MTV.
###232 We had the Miss Hawaiian Tropic International pageant.
###235 STEVE PENDLEND: We had 250,000 to 300,000 kids for an
###238 eight-week period of time.
###239 -We would do, I would say, on an average, anywhere from 30
###244 to 45 tattoos a day.
###247 It was really good for everything, all the way down
###249 to gas stations and restaurants.
###252 I don't see where all the problem--
###253 what they tried to say was such a big problem.
###255 
###261 -So everybody thinks, oh, it's spring break, it's party time.
###264 In reality, there's another element that
###265 comes into this city.
###266 They're out there selling drugs.
###267 They're looking to do rapes.
###268 They're looking to do burglaries.
###269 They're looking to hurt somebody.
###270 DAVE: There's nothing really to do but do drugs, so it's
###274 right up someone's alley if they want to get
###275 fucked up all the time.
###279 MATT: If this was mid-October, the owners would
###282 just kill us all.
###283 But it's during spring break, so they just let the
###286 ridiculousness happen.
###289 SCOTT EDWARDS: We are marketing to America's best
###294 and brightest young people.
###296 I don't see what the problem is.
###298 RANDY PHILLIPS: They want to make it this pristine, clean,
###301 clear, no vacationers, no whatever, family town.
###305 STEVE PENDLEND: They didn't replace it with any business.
###307 SCOTT EDWARDS: The newspaper did an expose about two months
###310 ago in talking about all the closed businesses on A1A.
###314 And I think they counted up 205.
###316 RANDY PHILLIPS: I hate to use the word blight, but it has
###318 become a blight.
###319 Look at the cityscape around you.
###321 It literally looks like a bomb went off.
###324 This town could be something again.
###325 I want it to change for the better.
###327 I want to go back, not necessarily to what it was,
###329 but I definitely want it to aspire to be something better.
###335 But Daytona's got that unique quality about it.
###339 
###347 SCOTT EDWARDS: The college students really took a bad rap
###350 in a lot of ways.
###352 We are still a spring break destination.
###353 DAVE: More spring breakers are starting to come back.
###357 Every year there's more and more.
###358 SEAN BISHOP: Embrace the kids.
###359 Come down.
###360 Let them have fun.
###361 I mean, that's what this town's known for.
###362 MATT: If spring break was to ever class it up, I think it
###366 would lose the element of freedom.
