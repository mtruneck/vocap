1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:24,39



2
0:0:24,39 --> 0:0:26,65
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: New York
City's full of shit--


3
0:0:26,65 --> 0:0:31,5
real shit, 27 billion gallons
of shit that get dumped into


4
0:0:31,5 --> 0:0:32,95
the Hudson River every year.


5
0:0:32,95 --> 0:0:35,68
And that's billions, with a b.


6
0:0:35,68 --> 0:0:38,5
Even though the city pipes in
crystal-clear drinking water


7
0:0:38,5 --> 0:0:41,3
from a collection of reservoirs
up north, the


8
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:44,6
waters that New Yorkers see
and smell every day are a


9
0:0:44,6 --> 0:0:46,4
toxic nightmare.


10
0:0:46,4 --> 0:0:51,32
Oil spills, PCBs, rotting
corpses, human feces, and 15


11
0:0:51,32 --> 0:0:53,91
feet of something called "black
mayonnaise" are just a


12
0:0:53,91 --> 0:0:56,5
few of the pristine features
Mayor Bloomberg


13
0:0:56,5 --> 0:0:58,71
isn't bragging about.


14
0:0:58,71 --> 0:1:1,6
We're dipping our toes in and
testing the waters for


15
0:1:1,6 --> 0:1:4,19
ourselves to see how the
toxicity of the Hudson River


16
0:1:4,19 --> 0:1:7,37
has become the norm for
America's urban waterways.


17
0:1:7,37 --> 0:1:32,962
Welcome to "Toxic."


18
0:1:32,962 --> 0:1:35,69
All right, I'm getting out.


19
0:1:35,69 --> 0:1:39,162
I'm going to take this sample,
make my way out of here.


20
0:1:39,162 --> 0:1:43,13



21
0:1:43,13 --> 0:1:46,9
All right, so that was it.


22
0:1:46,9 --> 0:1:48,394
Hudson River swim.


23
0:1:48,394 --> 0:1:49,644
Fucking disgusting.


24
0:1:49,644 --> 0:2:1,924



25
0:2:1,924 --> 0:2:3,16
TRACY BROWN: New York City
wouldn't be New York City if


26
0:2:3,16 --> 0:2:4,84
it wasn't for the
Hudson River.


27
0:2:4,84 --> 0:2:8,699
The fact that it is on the river
and surrounded by water


28
0:2:8,699 --> 0:2:11,7
is what defines the city and
gives it its character.


29
0:2:11,7 --> 0:2:15,3
One of the lingering problems
we still have to address is


30
0:2:15,3 --> 0:2:17,57
sewage pollution.


31
0:2:17,57 --> 0:2:19,8
-In the early development of New
York City, wetlands were


32
0:2:19,8 --> 0:2:21,225
considered wastelands.


33
0:2:21,225 --> 0:2:24,38
And they were basically filled
in with garbage to create


34
0:2:24,38 --> 0:2:25,89
solid land.


35
0:2:25,89 --> 0:2:27,32
TRACY BROWN: Where you have
older cities, like New York


36
0:2:27,32 --> 0:2:32,8
City, and Albany, and Yonkers,
where they used to build the


37
0:2:32,8 --> 0:2:34,41
wastewater infrastructure
where the sewage and the


38
0:2:34,41 --> 0:2:37,15
stormwater went through
the same pipe.


39
0:2:37,15 --> 0:2:40,44
So when too much rain happened,
it would overwhelm


40
0:2:40,44 --> 0:2:42,71
those pipes, and they didn't
want all that rain and


41
0:2:42,71 --> 0:2:44,66
stormwater to go to their sewage
treatment plant and


42
0:2:44,66 --> 0:2:47,23
overwhelm the sewage treatment
plant or back up into people's


43
0:2:47,23 --> 0:2:49,33
houses, so they just
bypass it directly


44
0:2:49,33 --> 0:2:51,5
into their local waterway.


45
0:2:51,5 --> 0:2:54,21
And that's what happens in New
York City when it rains.


46
0:2:54,21 --> 0:2:57,81
That's what happens in other
cities around the country.


47
0:2:57,81 --> 0:2:59,2
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: The River
Project has been


48
0:2:59,2 --> 0:3:1,55
systematically testing the
bacterial content of the


49
0:3:1,55 --> 0:3:3,27
Hudson River for years now.


50
0:3:3,27 --> 0:3:6,39
So we took our sample to their
lab to evaluate it for


51
0:3:6,39 --> 0:3:8,86
bacterial content that signifies
the presence of


52
0:3:8,86 --> 0:3:11,204
fecal matter in the river.


53
0:3:11,204 --> 0:3:11,648
-Hello.


54
0:3:11,648 --> 0:3:12,166
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Hello.


55
0:3:12,166 --> 0:3:12,536
-This is Nina.


56
0:3:12,536 --> 0:3:14,37
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Hi
Nina, I'm Emerson.


57
0:3:14,37 --> 0:3:17,28
I'm here from Vice.


58
0:3:17,28 --> 0:3:18,78
I was swimming in it.


59
0:3:18,78 --> 0:3:20,28
-OK.


60
0:3:20,28 --> 0:3:22,1
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: I cut my foot
on some rocks on the way.


61
0:3:22,1 --> 0:3:23,938
Do you think that's
a bad thing?


62
0:3:23,938 --> 0:3:25,336
-Did you wash it out?


63
0:3:25,336 --> 0:3:26,268
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Not yet.


64
0:3:26,268 --> 0:3:26,734
-You should probably
go wash it out.


65
0:3:26,734 --> 0:3:28,14
-You should.


66
0:3:28,14 --> 0:3:29,13
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: OK,
I'll take care of


67
0:3:29,13 --> 0:3:31,13
that as soon as possible.


68
0:3:31,13 --> 0:3:32,38
All right.


69
0:3:32,38 --> 0:3:41,62



70
0:3:41,62 --> 0:3:44,5
-And then you leave it to
incubate for 24 hours at 41


71
0:3:44,5 --> 0:3:45,3
degrees Celsius.


72
0:3:45,3 --> 0:3:47,55



73
0:3:47,55 --> 0:3:49,44
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Commercial
fishing on the Hudson was put


74
0:3:49,44 --> 0:3:51,98
to an end after the fish were
deemed too toxic for


75
0:3:51,98 --> 0:3:52,88
consumption.


76
0:3:52,88 --> 0:3:56,7
So after I cut my foot, I
started to worry that, I, too,


77
0:3:56,7 --> 0:3:59,27
like many of the poor, native
fish species, might end up


78
0:3:59,27 --> 0:4:0,905
jawless, three-eyed,
and sterile.


79
0:4:0,905 --> 0:4:4,29



80
0:4:4,29 --> 0:4:6,64
The Atlantic tomcod has the
unique honor of being the


81
0:4:6,64 --> 0:4:10,51
first fish species to adapt
to PCBs, the toxic factory


82
0:4:10,51 --> 0:4:14,44
coolants GE poured generously
into the Hudson in the '70s.


83
0:4:14,44 --> 0:4:17,86
Usually known to cause cancers
and deformations in the fish,


84
0:4:17,86 --> 0:4:21,29
some tomcod have adapted
to thrive in a PCB-rich


85
0:4:21,29 --> 0:4:24,3
environment and have since
evolved to survive in such a


86
0:4:24,3 --> 0:4:25,26
toxic world.


87
0:4:25,26 --> 0:4:27,49
CHRIS CHAMBERS: My particular
group studies the early life


88
0:4:27,49 --> 0:4:28,78
stages of marine fish.


89
0:4:28,78 --> 0:4:30,35
And we're particularly
interested in how the


90
0:4:30,35 --> 0:4:32,56
environments and habitat affects
the survival and


91
0:4:32,56 --> 0:4:35,39
fitness of those animals.


92
0:4:35,39 --> 0:4:38,24
This is a typical tomcod
larva hatching.


93
0:4:38,24 --> 0:4:40,35
The head and eyes are
dark in hatching.


94
0:4:40,35 --> 0:4:42,26
Jaw is typically straight.


95
0:4:42,26 --> 0:4:44,285
Here's some not so
nice baby fish.


96
0:4:44,285 --> 0:4:47,33
What you see here is a greatly
enlarged yolk sac.


97
0:4:47,33 --> 0:4:48,83
That's the edema
I referred to.


98
0:4:48,83 --> 0:4:50,72
The jaw is malformed.


99
0:4:50,72 --> 0:4:53,46
The head has a bit
of a point to it.


100
0:4:53,46 --> 0:4:55,15
The eyes are not as dark.


101
0:4:55,15 --> 0:4:59,5
And the body tends be more
curved or not as straight.


102
0:4:59,5 --> 0:5:0,96
TRACY BROWN: There's such
limited commercial fishing


103
0:5:0,96 --> 0:5:2,93
still allowed on the
Hudson based on the


104
0:5:2,93 --> 0:5:4,27
health of the fish.


105
0:5:4,27 --> 0:5:7,34
Commercial fishing, as a way
of life, on the Hudson was


106
0:5:7,34 --> 0:5:10,89
destroyed and taken away because
of the pollution in


107
0:5:10,89 --> 0:5:14,0
the river and its effect
on the fish stock.


108
0:5:14,0 --> 0:5:15,95
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: The 14
wastewater treatment plants


109
0:5:15,95 --> 0:5:18,93
around the city process
1.3 billion gallons of


110
0:5:18,93 --> 0:5:20,53
raw sewage a day.


111
0:5:20,53 --> 0:5:23,32
That's 15,000 gallons
per second.


112
0:5:23,32 --> 0:5:26,41
Before they were built, and for
most of the 20th century,


113
0:5:26,41 --> 0:5:29,2
all that sewage was just loaded
onto a boat and dumped


114
0:5:29,2 --> 0:5:31,16
12 miles east of the
Jersey shore.


115
0:5:31,16 --> 0:5:33,52
Later, they decided to
dump further out--


116
0:5:33,52 --> 0:5:35,58
106 miles instead.


117
0:5:35,58 --> 0:5:39,17
In 1991, somebody thought it
was a good idea to load all


118
0:5:39,17 --> 0:5:42,67
the sludge onto a train and send
it 2,000 miles to Sierra


119
0:5:42,67 --> 0:5:45,8
Blanca, a little town
in west Texas.


120
0:5:45,8 --> 0:5:48,8
New York State sent Texas
250 tons of sludge a


121
0:5:48,8 --> 0:5:51,83
day for over 10 years.


122
0:5:51,83 --> 0:5:54,63
NEVIN COHEN: Combined sewer
overflows were the last


123
0:5:54,63 --> 0:5:58,72
remaining uncontrolled form of
water pollution in cities.


124
0:5:58,72 --> 0:6:0,45
There are a few things
that a city can do.


125
0:6:0,45 --> 0:6:2,45
It can build holding tanks.


126
0:6:2,45 --> 0:6:4,74
It can actually enlarge
the sewer pipes.


127
0:6:4,74 --> 0:6:7,81
But those are really expensive,
and the alternative


128
0:6:7,81 --> 0:6:11,47
to gray infrastructure for CSOs
is green infrastructure.


129
0:6:11,47 --> 0:6:15,4
And that means building parks,
and gardens, and bioswales,


130
0:6:15,4 --> 0:6:20,37
and other permeable surfaces in
the city to both absorb and


131
0:6:20,37 --> 0:6:21,775
slow down the flow
of stormwater.


132
0:6:21,775 --> 0:6:25,83



133
0:6:25,83 --> 0:6:26,17
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: All right.


134
0:6:26,17 --> 0:6:28,83
So yesterday, after my delicious
dip in the Hudson


135
0:6:28,83 --> 0:6:32,41
River, we took a water sample
and came here to the River


136
0:6:32,41 --> 0:6:35,72
Project, let our sample incubate
for 24 hours, and now


137
0:6:35,72 --> 0:6:38,705
we're back to find out what was
really in the water I was


138
0:6:38,705 --> 0:6:39,955
swimming in.


139
0:6:39,955 --> 0:6:42,115



140
0:6:42,115 --> 0:6:46,91
-If our MPN is below 30,
then that is a green


141
0:6:46,91 --> 0:6:48,79
light from the EPA.


142
0:6:48,79 --> 0:6:49,286
So you can basically
do whatever


143
0:6:49,286 --> 0:6:49,62
you'd like in the water.


144
0:6:49,62 --> 0:6:51,7
You can go swimming.


145
0:6:51,7 --> 0:6:55,995
If it is over 100 for the MPN,
you should be careful, whether


146
0:6:55,995 --> 0:6:57,69
you're recreating in the water
But you definitely don't want


147
0:6:57,69 --> 0:7:0,269
to get the water in your
face, in your eyes, or


148
0:7:0,269 --> 0:7:4,261
anything like that.


149
0:7:4,261 --> 0:7:7,76
259 bacterial colonies.


150
0:7:7,76 --> 0:7:9,87
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: So not only
was the water I was swimming


151
0:7:9,87 --> 0:7:13,73
in above the EPA limits--


152
0:7:13,73 --> 0:7:20,3
which nobody had told me-- it
was about 2.5 times above


153
0:7:20,3 --> 0:7:21,253
federal standards.


154
0:7:21,253 --> 0:7:23,851



155
0:7:23,851 --> 0:7:24,332
-Yeah.


156
0:7:24,332 --> 0:7:27,218
-You definitely shouldn't be
swimming in the water.


157
0:7:27,218 --> 0:7:28,18
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Shouldn't
have done that?


158
0:7:28,18 --> 0:7:30,12
-No.


159
0:7:30,12 --> 0:7:32,629
I hope you didn't swallow any.


160
0:7:32,629 --> 0:7:33,879
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Me too.


161
0:7:33,879 --> 0:7:36,76



162
0:7:36,76 --> 0:7:40,5
Tracy Brown and River Keepers'
Sewage Right to Know Act


163
0:7:40,5 --> 0:7:42,36
mandates that the public are
notified immediately when


164
0:7:42,36 --> 0:7:44,33
sewage is dumped into
the Hudson.


165
0:7:44,33 --> 0:7:47,2
But it's almost too obvious that
public officials should


166
0:7:47,2 --> 0:7:49,16
warn the people when they're
paddle boarding


167
0:7:49,16 --> 0:7:50,7
in a bunch of shit.


168
0:7:50,7 --> 0:7:53,36
But while Governor Cuomo signed
the act in August, it's


169
0:7:53,36 --> 0:7:57,28
going to take at least until
May 2013, for provisions to


170
0:7:57,28 --> 0:7:58,473
take effect.


171
0:7:58,473 --> 0:8:1,2
TRACY BROWN: This is the new,
more dangerous pollutant.


172
0:8:1,2 --> 0:8:4,34
As people get back in the water,
sewage gets in the


173
0:8:4,34 --> 0:8:8,37
water, there's less money for
testing, and there's very few


174
0:8:8,37 --> 0:8:10,49
requirements to tell the public


175
0:8:10,49 --> 0:8:11,82
that you aren't testing.


176
0:8:11,82 --> 0:8:15,71
I can tell you that New York
City was not supportive of the


177
0:8:15,71 --> 0:8:17,33
Sewage Right to Know Law.


178
0:8:17,33 --> 0:8:20,61
They worked hard in the
legislative process to water


179
0:8:20,61 --> 0:8:21,26
down the bill.


180
0:8:21,26 --> 0:8:24,435
And we hope that, now that it's
passed, we'll implement


181
0:8:24,435 --> 0:8:26,91
it in the way that it's intended
to be implemented.


182
0:8:26,91 --> 0:8:29,92
I would say based on my
experience that it does not


183
0:8:29,92 --> 0:8:33,159
seem that the Bloomberg
administration is interested


184
0:8:33,159 --> 0:8:35,795
in letting people know about the
sewage problem around New


185
0:8:35,795 --> 0:8:36,45
York City--


186
0:8:36,45 --> 0:8:39,919
absolutely not, no.


187
0:8:39,919 --> 0:8:41,61
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: The
Environmental Protection


188
0:8:41,61 --> 0:8:44,35
Agency has forced New York
City to solve many of its


189
0:8:44,35 --> 0:8:47,7
water quality issues since the
days of hauling our sewage by


190
0:8:47,7 --> 0:8:49,6
train to Texas.


191
0:8:49,6 --> 0:8:52,425
But our test sample found that
even a mile or so upstream of


192
0:8:52,425 --> 0:8:56,46
Manhattan, the Hudson River
contained 2.5 times the legal


193
0:8:56,46 --> 0:8:57,96
limit of feces.


194
0:8:57,96 --> 0:9:0,45
And this isn't only New
York City's problem.


195
0:9:0,45 --> 0:9:4,31
Since 772 of America's cities
were built with combined


196
0:9:4,31 --> 0:9:7,55
sewage systems, about 40 million
people living near


197
0:9:7,55 --> 0:9:10,52
urban waterways will be up shit
creek for years to come.


198
0:9:10,52 --> 0:9:24,96



199
0:9:24,96 --> 0:9:27,9
-Some days are just
unforgettable-- the birth of a


200
0:9:27,9 --> 0:9:31,116
child, your first day at school,
the day you fell in a


201
0:9:31,116 --> 0:9:32,58
giant sinkhole.


202
0:9:32,58 --> 0:9:33,64
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: So we're
right outside of Gainesville.
