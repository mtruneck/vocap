1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,53



2
0:0:0,53 --> 0:0:1,5
THURMAN SEWELL: I have some
twin people that hit us up


3
0:0:1,5 --> 0:0:3,59
like, "Yeah, we're like you
guys." I'm like, "No, no


4
0:0:3,59 --> 0:0:5,675
you're not." You know
what I mean?


5
0:0:5,675 --> 0:0:7,1
You're just not.


6
0:0:7,1 --> 0:0:8,9
SIDNEY SEWELL: You'll never
have street cred, homie.


7
0:0:8,9 --> 0:0:9,54
You know what I'm saying?


8
0:0:9,54 --> 0:0:11,27
Like, you'll never get down.


9
0:0:11,27 --> 0:0:12,35
THURMAN SEWELL: Never
get down.


10
0:0:12,35 --> 0:0:14,995
SIDNEY SEWELL: [INAUDIBLE]
to get where we're at.


11
0:0:14,995 --> 0:0:28,9
[MAAL THE PIMP, "CHATTANOOGA"]


12
0:0:28,9 --> 0:0:30,6
-Let's start at the
beginning, I mean.


13
0:0:30,6 --> 0:0:31,94
Chattanooga, Tennessee.


14
0:0:31,94 --> 0:0:33,65
Have you guys ever been
to Chattanooga?


15
0:0:33,65 --> 0:0:34,88
SIDNEY SEWELL: Well,
Chattanooga's actually a big


16
0:0:34,88 --> 0:0:37,3
touristy because they have the
aquarium, they have like this


17
0:0:37,3 --> 0:0:39,1
Rock City bullshit.


18
0:0:39,1 --> 0:0:41,2
I don't know how other people
might perceive it, but the way


19
0:0:41,2 --> 0:0:44,44
we grew up there, and where we
grew up at was fucking gnarly.


20
0:0:44,44 --> 0:0:45,37
THURMAN SEWELL: It's
really a ghetto-ass


21
0:0:45,37 --> 0:0:48,18
little fucking town.


22
0:0:48,18 --> 0:0:50,63
CHRIS SCOGGINS: The first thing
you're going to see is


23
0:0:50,63 --> 0:0:53,33
the East Lake courts.


24
0:0:53,33 --> 0:0:55,64
Look at those beautiful
buildings there.


25
0:0:55,64 --> 0:0:58,32
This is the most dangerous
projects in Chattanooga.


26
0:0:58,32 --> 0:1:1,8



27
0:1:1,8 --> 0:1:3,8
Any one of these streets right
here you turn down the wrong


28
0:1:3,8 --> 0:1:6,86
time of day will get
you killed, or it


29
0:1:6,86 --> 0:1:8,496
might get you laid.


30
0:1:8,496 --> 0:1:10,31
SIDNEY SEWELL: When we were kids
we would like, you know,


31
0:1:10,31 --> 0:1:11,7
fuck with hookers.


32
0:1:11,7 --> 0:1:11,68
THURMAN SEWELL: It
was so sketchy.


33
0:1:11,68 --> 0:1:15,9
You'd be outside, and these
fucking creepos would come up,


34
0:1:15,9 --> 0:1:16,43
"You need a ride?"


35
0:1:16,43 --> 0:1:17,66
CHRIS NIERATKO: Really?


36
0:1:17,66 --> 0:1:19,12
THURMAN SEWELL: People have
tried to kidnap us before.


37
0:1:19,12 --> 0:1:20,3
SIDNEY SEWELL: Like why
would they be wanting


38
0:1:20,3 --> 0:1:20,86
to give us a ride?


39
0:1:20,86 --> 0:1:23,1
You're fucking creeps trying
to butt-fuck us.


40
0:1:23,1 --> 0:1:26,23
You know what I mean?


41
0:1:26,23 --> 0:1:26,67
CHRIS SCOGGINS: Look
at this one.


42
0:1:26,67 --> 0:1:28,55
They got more junk
in the front yard


43
0:1:28,55 --> 0:1:30,7
than 10 houses combined.


44
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:32,58
There's a cop right there, just
hanging out, talking to


45
0:1:32,58 --> 0:1:33,88
the dope dealers.


46
0:1:33,88 --> 0:1:36,36
Smell the stuff cooking.


47
0:1:36,36 --> 0:1:38,41
SIDNEY SEWELL: We grew up
super in like poverty.


48
0:1:38,41 --> 0:1:38,81
You know what I mean?


49
0:1:38,81 --> 0:1:42,69
Like on food stamps, our dad was
disabled, so we got like


50
0:1:42,69 --> 0:1:43,95
these checks every month.


51
0:1:43,95 --> 0:1:46,14
It was just super ghetto.


52
0:1:46,14 --> 0:1:48,5
Our parents, the way they
raised was they told us


53
0:1:48,5 --> 0:1:50,21
everything, like how it was.


54
0:1:50,21 --> 0:1:50,76
You know what I mean?


55
0:1:50,76 --> 0:1:51,69
THURMAN SEWELL: We watched
R-rated movies when we were


56
0:1:51,69 --> 0:1:52,62
five years old.


57
0:1:52,62 --> 0:1:54,25
CHRIS NIERATKO: So you look
at that as a good thing?


58
0:1:54,25 --> 0:1:54,78
THURMAN SEWELL: Yeah.


59
0:1:54,78 --> 0:1:57,65
SIDNEY SEWELL: Yeah, 'cause we
got brought up to see life how


60
0:1:57,65 --> 0:1:58,51
it really is.


61
0:1:58,51 --> 0:2:0,453
CHRIS NIERATKO: How many
sisters you got?


62
0:2:0,453 --> 0:2:1,38
SEWELL BROTHERS: Two.


63
0:2:1,38 --> 0:2:1,76
SIDNEY SEWELL: Nah, man.


64
0:2:1,76 --> 0:2:3,37
You know what's crazy
is one of our


65
0:2:3,37 --> 0:2:4,22
sisters went to Harvard.


66
0:2:4,22 --> 0:2:5,16
THURMAN SEWELL: Studied
her whole life.


67
0:2:5,16 --> 0:2:8,539
Got this like financial aid into
the private schools, and


68
0:2:8,539 --> 0:2:10,685
we were kind of like counting
on her to be like the family


69
0:2:10,685 --> 0:2:11,87
fortune, like fuck this shit.


70
0:2:11,87 --> 0:2:14,2
We're just gonna skate, and
she'll be rich one day, and


71
0:2:14,2 --> 0:2:15,11
we're not gonna have
to do fucking shit.


72
0:2:15,11 --> 0:2:15,92
You know what I mean?


73
0:2:15,92 --> 0:2:17,83
Like we really had
that mentality.


74
0:2:17,83 --> 0:2:19,95
SIDNEY SEWELL: We never even
went to high school.


75
0:2:19,95 --> 0:2:20,16
CHRIS NIERATKO: Really?


76
0:2:20,16 --> 0:2:22,215
SIDNEY SEWELL: We went to
fucking half of eighth grade,


77
0:2:22,215 --> 0:2:23,8
and like school?


78
0:2:23,8 --> 0:2:24,62
Fuck school.


79
0:2:24,62 --> 0:2:25,44
We always hated school.


80
0:2:25,44 --> 0:2:26,9
All right?


81
0:2:26,9 --> 0:2:27,59
We always got fucked
with at school.


82
0:2:27,59 --> 0:2:30,5
Like I'm sure now like in
school, skate boarders are


83
0:2:30,5 --> 0:2:31,3
popular kids.


84
0:2:31,3 --> 0:2:32,32
It was not like that.


85
0:2:32,32 --> 0:2:33,25
CHRIS NIERATKO: So eighth
grade is as


86
0:2:33,25 --> 0:2:34,14
far as you guys got?


87
0:2:34,14 --> 0:2:34,54
SIDNEY SEWELL: Yeah.


88
0:2:34,54 --> 0:2:35,58
Still to this day, I hate it.


89
0:2:35,58 --> 0:2:36,61
THURMAN SEWELL: I don't
regret quitting.


90
0:2:36,61 --> 0:2:38,51
SIDNEY SEWELL: I don't want
to go to any school.


91
0:2:38,51 --> 0:2:40,16
People try to get us to
go back to school.


92
0:2:40,16 --> 0:2:41,9
No.


93
0:2:41,9 --> 0:2:42,8
We were bad kids, yo.


94
0:2:42,8 --> 0:2:44,77
We were just fucking punks.


95
0:2:44,77 --> 0:2:45,68
We didn't go to school.


96
0:2:45,68 --> 0:2:47,63
We didn't do shit
except skate.


97
0:2:47,63 --> 0:2:49,85
CHRIS NIERATKO: How about
when your mom left?


98
0:2:49,85 --> 0:2:51,13
She left your old man.


99
0:2:51,13 --> 0:2:52,19
Why did she leave?


100
0:2:52,19 --> 0:2:53,17
What was the reason?


101
0:2:53,17 --> 0:2:54,56
SIDNEY SEWELL: She
was unhappy.


102
0:2:54,56 --> 0:2:56,14
THURMAN SEWELL: He was disabled,
and she wanted to


103
0:2:56,14 --> 0:2:56,94
live her life.


104
0:2:56,94 --> 0:2:58,455
SIDNEY SEWELL: She had four
fucking kids her whole


105
0:2:58,455 --> 0:2:59,21
god-damned life.


106
0:2:59,21 --> 0:3:1,56
THURMAN SEWELL: She got married
when she was 16.


107
0:3:1,56 --> 0:3:2,75
She was just over it.


108
0:3:2,75 --> 0:3:3,365
She wanted to go live life.


109
0:3:3,365 --> 0:3:5,1
SIDNEY SEWELL: So she did.


110
0:3:5,1 --> 0:3:7,68
Mom left dad when
we were like 12.


111
0:3:7,68 --> 0:3:10,92
We were really close to our
dad, you know what I mean?


112
0:3:10,92 --> 0:3:11,66
Our dad--


113
0:3:11,66 --> 0:3:12,99
THURMAN SEWELL: He had
gotten a pacemaker.


114
0:3:12,99 --> 0:3:14,28
SIDNEY SEWELL: It was just
sketchy, kind of, and he'd


115
0:3:14,28 --> 0:3:16,79
take insulin, take all
this shit, diabetes.


116
0:3:16,79 --> 0:3:17,74
THURMAN SEWELL: He would
take about 50


117
0:3:17,74 --> 0:3:18,29
different pills a day.


118
0:3:18,29 --> 0:3:20,49
Like it was just crazy,
I mean it was crazy.


119
0:3:20,49 --> 0:3:22,5
CHRIS NIERATKO: And were you
guys responsible for taking


120
0:3:22,5 --> 0:3:22,88
care of him?


121
0:3:22,88 --> 0:3:24,27
THURMAN SEWELL: Somewhat.


122
0:3:24,27 --> 0:3:26,964
We watched our dad die.


123
0:3:26,964 --> 0:3:28,35
CHRIS NIERATKO: What happened?


124
0:3:28,35 --> 0:3:30,1
SIDNEY SEWELL: What happened
was, man, I won't get too deep


125
0:3:30,1 --> 0:3:32,16
into it 'cause it's pretty
emotional, but--


126
0:3:32,16 --> 0:3:33,59
THURMAN SEWELL: So he just
woke us up one morning.


127
0:3:33,59 --> 0:3:35,77
It's a Saturday, wakes us up
like, "I don't feel good."


128
0:3:35,77 --> 0:3:36,25
SIDNEY SEWELL: He got up--


129
0:3:36,25 --> 0:3:37,68
THURMAN SEWELL: He starts going
like that, he starts


130
0:3:37,68 --> 0:3:38,89
blacking out, and we're
like, fuck.


131
0:3:38,89 --> 0:3:39,92
What the fuck, you know?


132
0:3:39,92 --> 0:3:43,93
SIDNEY SEWELL: So I called 911,
and they were like uh,


133
0:3:43,93 --> 0:3:46,32
telling us how to do mouth
to mouth and all


134
0:3:46,32 --> 0:3:46,85
that type of shit.


135
0:3:46,85 --> 0:3:47,21
THURMAN SEWELL: We
tried all that.


136
0:3:47,21 --> 0:3:48,79
SIDNEY SEWELL: We tried,
and it wasn't working.


137
0:3:48,79 --> 0:3:49,426
THURMAN SEWELL: Then the
ambulance showed up, and they


138
0:3:49,426 --> 0:3:50,9
were like doing the electric
shocks, and we


139
0:3:50,9 --> 0:3:51,77
just kind of left.


140
0:3:51,77 --> 0:3:52,62
SIDNEY SEWELL: We were
freaked out.


141
0:3:52,62 --> 0:3:53,5
THURMAN SEWELL: We didn't
want to believe it.


142
0:3:53,5 --> 0:3:54,47
SIDNEY SEWELL: We were
really hysterical.


143
0:3:54,47 --> 0:3:55,745
THURMAN SEWELL: We thought, like
all right, he'll be all


144
0:3:55,745 --> 0:3:56,62
right, because they
took him away.


145
0:3:56,62 --> 0:3:57,55
SIDNEY SEWELL: But deep
down we knew.


146
0:3:57,55 --> 0:4:0,85
THURMAN SEWELL: We knew, but
then we get a call like an


147
0:4:0,85 --> 0:4:4,73
hour later, our aunts called,
like yeah, your dad's dead.


148
0:4:4,73 --> 0:4:7,41
It was just crazy.


149
0:4:7,41 --> 0:4:9,53
CHRIS NIERATKO: What's the
relationship with your mom?


150
0:4:9,53 --> 0:4:11,91
SIDNEY SEWELL: We were all
bitter about it, because we


151
0:4:11,91 --> 0:4:14,4
thought it was fucked
up that she left.


152
0:4:14,4 --> 0:4:15,33
THURMAN SEWELL: So anyway,
so we're in


153
0:4:15,33 --> 0:4:16,529
Chattanooga, whatever.


154
0:4:16,529 --> 0:4:19,679
My mom was in Knoxville, so
after our dad died, we were


155
0:4:19,679 --> 0:4:21,0
forced to move to Knoxville,
Tennessee,


156
0:4:21,0 --> 0:4:21,66
SIDNEY SEWELL: There's a guy--


157
0:4:21,66 --> 0:4:22,47
THURMAN SEWELL: Another
shit hole.


158
0:4:22,47 --> 0:4:24,27
SIDNEY SEWELL: All right, but
there's a guy we met named


159
0:4:24,27 --> 0:4:30,83
Chris Scoggins, who was five
years older than us, and he


160
0:4:30,83 --> 0:4:32,4
lived right around the
corner from us.


161
0:4:32,4 --> 0:4:34,85
CHRIS SCOGGINS: That was like
early '90s, pulled up into


162
0:4:34,85 --> 0:4:37,93
this hood-ass neighborhood and
saw these two cats sitting on


163
0:4:37,93 --> 0:4:41,26
the front porch, and these two
kids like finishing each


164
0:4:41,26 --> 0:4:42,52
other's sentences.


165
0:4:42,52 --> 0:4:46,5
I can't tell them apart, like
fucking long-ass black hair


166
0:4:46,5 --> 0:4:48,71
with like Misfits skateboards.


167
0:4:48,71 --> 0:4:51,27
And we just start kicking it
every day, just skating out in


168
0:4:51,27 --> 0:4:54,27
front of the house and fucking
with the neighborhood kids and


169
0:4:54,27 --> 0:4:55,78
getting into fights and shit,
and fucking with the


170
0:4:55,78 --> 0:4:56,62
prostitutes.


171
0:4:56,62 --> 0:4:58,29
They walk by, we
holler at 'em.


172
0:4:58,29 --> 0:5:0,31
And I guess in turn, yeah,
we taught each


173
0:5:0,31 --> 0:5:1,56
other how to skate.


174
0:5:1,56 --> 0:5:4,41



175
0:5:4,41 --> 0:5:6,2
SIDNEY SEWELL: He really showed
us the way as far as


176
0:5:6,2 --> 0:5:8,65
like everything, what's cool.


177
0:5:8,65 --> 0:5:11,102
So we started skating in the
hood, and we waxed this curb


178
0:5:11,102 --> 0:5:14,895
up at a Dollar General store,
and we really got into


179
0:5:14,895 --> 0:5:16,95
skateboarding for real and
really started skating.


180
0:5:16,95 --> 0:5:21,11



181
0:5:21,11 --> 0:5:23,17
CHRIS SCOGGINS: I was skating
a lot, but when I met those


182
0:5:23,17 --> 0:5:25,66
dudes, they taught me the
difference between cake flip,


183
0:5:25,66 --> 0:5:27,68
Nollie flip, switchfoot,
fakie flip.


184
0:5:27,68 --> 0:5:31,11
Taught me fucking who Pepe
Martinez was, who Mike Carroll


185
0:5:31,11 --> 0:5:33,47
was, who Stevie Williams was.


186
0:5:33,47 --> 0:5:34,44
I didn't know all that.


187
0:5:34,44 --> 0:5:35,45
I just skated.


188
0:5:35,45 --> 0:5:39,9
Sidney and Thurman were
my favorite skaters.


189
0:5:39,9 --> 0:5:39,97
THURMAN SEWELL: It
was amazing.


190
0:5:39,97 --> 0:5:42,78
We had the time of our life.


191
0:5:42,78 --> 0:5:43,6
We just skated.


192
0:5:43,6 --> 0:5:44,24
SIDNEY SEWELL: All
we did was skate.


193
0:5:44,24 --> 0:5:47,71
THURMAN SEWELL: Every day, all
day, and then just party.


194
0:5:47,71 --> 0:5:51,14



195
0:5:51,14 --> 0:5:54,46
JON NEWPORT: At the time, we
were all catching rides to get


196
0:5:54,46 --> 0:5:57,31
to downtown Atlanta to go skate,
and we would go skate


197
0:5:57,31 --> 0:5:59,8
with all the older heads, 'cause
we were kind of on the


198
0:5:59,8 --> 0:6:2,73
same shit, and there was this
graffiti yard called 40 Yard


199
0:6:2,73 --> 0:6:4,185
in midtown Atlanta.


200
0:6:4,185 --> 0:6:7,77



201
0:6:7,77 --> 0:6:9,33
Man, we all used to

skateboarding?

it in the way we thought we


211
0:6:33,7 --> 0:6:37,606
were, but deep down that shit's
like making NBA, you

but I think we were

0:6:50,11 --> 0:6:52,35
just scared back then.

around people like

met the ATL twins, I think


231
0:7:8,16 --> 0:7:10,39
they were called like the Kalis
twins in Atlanta for


232
0:7:10,39 --> 0:7:13,56
awhile or something like that,
we just clicked, man.


233
0:7:13,56 --> 0:7:15,23

0:7:15,23 --> 0:7:18,6
They got kind of the same
history as me when it comes to


235
0:7:18,6 --> 0:7:21,445
like the way we grew up and the
way our families were and


236
0:7:21,445 --> 0:7:22,94
all that type of shit.

full street skaters.
