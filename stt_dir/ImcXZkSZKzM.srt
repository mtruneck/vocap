1
0:0:1,234 --> 0:0:2,369
NARRATOR: Across the country,


2
0:0:2,369 --> 0:0:4,804
ordinary Americans
from all walks of life


3
0:0:4,804 --> 0:0:6,906
are taking
whatever measures necessary


4
0:0:6,906 --> 0:0:8,274
to prepare.


5
0:0:8,274 --> 0:0:10,509
MAN: We're preparing for
a series of terrorist attacks


6
0:0:10,509 --> 0:0:12,578
on the nuclear facilities
of this country.


7
0:0:12,578 --> 0:0:14,413
MAN: For the Yellowstone
super-volcano.


8
0:0:14,413 --> 0:0:17,283
MAN: Civil unrest following
a dirty bomb blast.


9
0:0:17,283 --> 0:0:18,985
NARRATOR:
And protect themselves...


10
0:0:18,985 --> 0:0:22,55
MAN: Boo-yeah!


11
0:0:22,55 --> 0:0:23,89
NARRATOR:
...from what they perceive


12
0:0:23,89 --> 0:0:27,993
is the fast-approaching
end of the world as we know it.


13
0:0:27,993 --> 0:0:30,229
GIRL:
Thomas, don't give 'em the gun!


14
0:0:30,229 --> 0:0:32,465
Don't give 'em the gun, Thomas!


15
0:0:32,465 --> 0:0:34,433
NARRATOR:
Next, we go inside the lives


16
0:0:34,433 --> 0:0:36,469
of three committed preppers


17
0:0:36,469 --> 0:0:38,771
who have devised
extensive plans...


18
0:0:38,771 --> 0:0:40,706
MAN: We've got dinner.


19
0:0:40,706 --> 0:0:42,408
NARRATOR:
...gone to great lengths...


20
0:0:42,408 --> 0:0:44,176
GIRL: There's no toilet.


21
0:0:44,176 --> 0:0:46,112
Toilets were made for a reason.


22
0:0:46,112 --> 0:0:47,413
Use them.


23
0:0:47,413 --> 0:0:49,482
NARRATOR: And made
huge personal sacrifices


24
0:0:49,482 --> 0:0:51,851
to ensure their very survival.


25
0:0:51,851 --> 0:0:53,419
MAN: It's great to have
healthy pets


26
0:0:53,419 --> 0:0:56,556
because you never know when
you're gonna need to eat 'em.


27
0:0:56,556 --> 0:0:58,925
NARRATOR: The experts
will assess their preps


28
0:0:58,925 --> 0:1:0,826
to see if they have
what it takes...


29
0:1:0,826 --> 0:1:2,528
GIRL: Hello.


30
0:1:2,528 --> 0:1:3,997
NARRATOR: ...to survive.


31
0:1:3,997 --> 0:1:6,165
MAN: Contact, rear!


32
0:1:6,165 --> 0:1:8,768
Need some covering fire!


33
0:1:8,768 --> 0:1:22,949
NARRATOR:
This is "Doomsday Preppers."


34
0:1:22,949 --> 0:1:26,119
Lucas Cameron
is a farmer in Tennessee.


35
0:1:26,119 --> 0:1:27,653
He's spent his entire life


36
0:1:27,653 --> 0:1:31,29
living and working
on the same tract of land.


37
0:1:31,29 --> 0:1:33,126
He, his wife Nikki,


38
0:1:33,126 --> 0:1:34,661
their son Jonathan,


39
0:1:34,661 --> 0:1:36,595
and his parents,
Mike and Brenda,


40
0:1:36,595 --> 0:1:39,498
are all God-fearing Christians.


41
0:1:39,498 --> 0:1:42,502
Lucas even works
for the local ministry.


42
0:1:42,502 --> 0:1:45,371
But when Lucas turned
to the good book for guidance,


43
0:1:45,371 --> 0:1:50,81
he found more than just a path
to spiritual salvation.


44
0:1:50,81 --> 0:1:54,214
He found stories
of the wrath of God


45
0:1:54,214 --> 0:1:57,449
and of men who were
preparing to endure it.


46
0:1:57,449 --> 0:1:59,552
LUCAS CAMERON:
Scripture's full of preppers.


47
0:1:59,552 --> 0:2:1,754
Noah built an ark,
and it saved his family.


48
0:2:1,754 --> 0:2:3,89
Joseph made sure
to put granaries in Egypt,


49
0:2:3,89 --> 0:2:7,593
and it saved not only
his family, but all of Egypt.


50
0:2:7,593 --> 0:2:9,61
I intend also to put back


51
0:2:9,61 --> 0:2:12,131
so that I can save myself
and my community.


52
0:2:12,131 --> 0:2:13,766
I'm preparing
for a global earthquake


53
0:2:13,766 --> 0:2:18,238
described in Revelation.


54
0:2:18,238 --> 0:2:22,174
Cut 'em off!
Cut 'em off!


55
0:2:22,174 --> 0:2:24,611
My life is different
to most people,


56
0:2:24,611 --> 0:2:27,613
because as they go about
their days carefree


57
0:2:27,613 --> 0:2:29,849
and never think about
what may happen tomorrow,


58
0:2:29,849 --> 0:2:31,95
the thought is always
in the back of my mind,


59
0:2:31,95 --> 0:2:34,887
and I make certain to prepare
for what is to come.


60
0:2:34,887 --> 0:2:36,456
There's nothing
more important to me


61
0:2:36,456 --> 0:2:37,89
than prepping


62
0:2:37,89 --> 0:2:41,928
because the scripture instructs
me to do so for the "end days."


63
0:2:41,928 --> 0:2:44,196
In the very near future,


64
0:2:44,196 --> 0:2:45,698
the events prophesied
in scripture


65
0:2:45,698 --> 0:2:48,867
in the book of Revelation
will come to life.


66
0:2:48,867 --> 0:2:49,936
There will be
a great earthquake,


67
0:2:49,936 --> 0:2:51,437
greater than one ever has been


68
0:2:51,437 --> 0:2:53,206
since the foundation
of the world.


69
0:2:53,206 --> 0:2:55,307
NARRATOR: Lucas believes
this great earthquake


70
0:2:55,307 --> 0:2:56,809
won't strike out west,


71
0:2:56,809 --> 0:2:58,377
but right under his feet,


72
0:2:58,377 --> 0:3:0,446
along the New Madrid
fault system.


73
0:3:0,446 --> 0:3:2,782
Parts of Tennessee
and several other states


74
0:3:2,782 --> 0:3:4,516
lay within the fault zone,


75
0:3:4,516 --> 0:3:8,53
the most active seismic area
east of the Rocky Mountains.


76
0:3:8,53 --> 0:3:10,456
In 1811 and 1812,


77
0:3:10,456 --> 0:3:13,559
a series of nearly
8.0 magnitude earthquakes


78
0:3:13,559 --> 0:3:15,494
tore through the New Madrid,


79
0:3:15,494 --> 0:3:17,663
creating huge landslides
and fissures


80
0:3:17,663 --> 0:3:22,68
that ripped across approximately
45,000 square miles


81
0:3:22,68 --> 0:3:24,136
and caused parts
of the Mississippi River


82
0:3:24,136 --> 0:3:26,239
to run backwards.


83
0:3:26,239 --> 0:3:31,1
Lucas believes this was nothing
compared with what's to come.


84
0:3:31,1 --> 0:3:32,978
LUCAS: In the days following
the earthquake,


85
0:3:32,978 --> 0:3:34,68
the chaos will erupt.


86
0:3:34,68 --> 0:3:36,516
Many people
will turn to lawlessness


87
0:3:36,516 --> 0:3:38,5
as a means for survival


88
0:3:38,5 --> 0:3:39,251
because they've not
took the time


89
0:3:39,251 --> 0:3:41,287
to make proper preparation.


90
0:3:41,287 --> 0:3:42,755
NARRATOR:
To prepare for Armageddon,


91
0:3:42,755 --> 0:3:44,523
Lucas and his friends and family


92
0:3:44,523 --> 0:3:46,959
have begun fortifying
the family farm,


93
0:3:46,959 --> 0:3:48,994
spending around $50,000


94
0:3:48,994 --> 0:3:52,298
to turn it into
a compound he calls...


95
0:3:52,298 --> 0:3:53,799
the Alamo.


96
0:3:53,799 --> 0:3:55,134
LUCAS: We call it that


97
0:3:55,134 --> 0:3:57,69
because that is the place
we look to for protection


98
0:3:57,69 --> 0:3:58,637
and our final holdout


99
0:3:58,637 --> 0:4:0,739
when these events
start to take place.


100
0:4:0,739 --> 0:4:3,642
This place is to be here as
a beacon of hope for many others


101
0:4:3,642 --> 0:4:8,481
and to also help light the way
for our community in recovery.


102
0:4:8,481 --> 0:4:11,417
NARRATOR: To help get the Alamo
ready for doomsday,


103
0:4:11,417 --> 0:4:14,254
Lucas and his family
have been recruiting others,


104
0:4:14,254 --> 0:4:20,126
with the goal of forming
an elite prepping force.


105
0:4:20,126 --> 0:4:24,363
They call themselves
the Seven Trumpet Preppers.


106
0:4:24,363 --> 0:4:26,865
Each member has been
hand-selected by Lucas


107
0:4:26,865 --> 0:4:28,935
for a skill set
he believes will be vital


108
0:4:28,935 --> 0:4:30,937
after a mega-earthquake.


109
0:4:30,937 --> 0:4:33,239
LUCAS: Everybody's in charge
of a certain task.


110
0:4:33,239 --> 0:4:35,541
Kevin has seen
the worst side of war


111
0:4:35,541 --> 0:4:37,844
and knows exactly
what it means.


112
0:4:37,844 --> 0:4:39,578
KEVIN: I win.


113
0:4:39,578 --> 0:4:42,481
LUCAS: He's in charge of
security during the daytime.


114
0:4:42,481 --> 0:4:44,35
LUCAS: Brian is
a night-shift worker now,


115
0:4:44,35 --> 0:4:46,184
and he's very accustomed
to the nighttime,


116
0:4:46,184 --> 0:4:50,222
and he will be in charge of
the night-shift security watch.


117
0:4:50,222 --> 0:4:53,59
My dad, he's been a farmer
for all his life.


118
0:4:53,59 --> 0:4:54,46
He's had plenty of skills


119
0:4:54,46 --> 0:4:57,696
in growing crops
and beef production.


120
0:4:57,696 --> 0:4:58,865
NARRATOR: If a major rupture


121
0:4:58,865 --> 0:5:1,66
within the New Madrid
fault zone occurs,


122
0:5:1,66 --> 0:5:3,702
it could leave more than
2.5 million homes


123
0:5:3,702 --> 0:5:7,673
in the central U.S.
without power.


124
0:5:7,673 --> 0:5:11,1
So Lucas is turning to another
of the Seven Trumpet Preppers,


125
0:5:11,1 --> 0:5:12,378
Scott,


126
0:5:12,378 --> 0:5:16,782
to ensure the Alamo has abundant
alternate energy sources.


127
0:5:16,782 --> 0:5:18,217
LUCAS: Me and Scott
have known each other


128
0:5:18,217 --> 0:5:20,19
since we were children.


129
0:5:20,19 --> 0:5:22,254
Scott assists me
in power projects


130
0:5:22,254 --> 0:5:24,22
and in fabrication
of the materials that we need


131
0:5:24,22 --> 0:5:25,658
for those things.


132
0:5:25,658 --> 0:5:28,36
SCOTT: If they have an idea,
I try to make it possible.


133
0:5:28,36 --> 0:5:31,163
I try to build it
as cheaply as I can


134
0:5:31,163 --> 0:5:32,831
and make it practical.


135
0:5:32,831 --> 0:5:34,7
LUCAS: As far as energy
is concerned,


136
0:5:34,7 --> 0:5:37,136
I have no intention to ever use
gasoline or diesel again


137
0:5:37,136 --> 0:5:39,371
once these events
begin to happen.


138
0:5:39,371 --> 0:5:40,606
Wood gasification


139
0:5:40,606 --> 0:5:42,875
is my only intention
of having a power source.


140
0:5:42,875 --> 0:5:46,45
NARRATOR: A gasifier can convert
materials such as wood


141
0:5:46,45 --> 0:5:47,58
into a petroleum substitute


142
0:5:47,58 --> 0:5:51,85
by burning the products at
a temperature above 450 degrees.


143
0:5:51,85 --> 0:5:53,85
LUCAS: We're gonna set this up,


144
0:5:53,85 --> 0:5:55,42
and then we'll start
sliding the boxes in.


145
0:5:55,42 --> 0:5:57,423
Alright, this one goes
in the top slot.


146
0:5:57,423 --> 0:5:59,158
The other one goes
in the filter area.


147
0:5:59,158 --> 0:6:1,493
NARRATOR: Lucas was able
to construct his gasifier


148
0:6:1,493 --> 0:6:6,365
out of ammo boxes and old scrap
materials worth less than $200.


149
0:6:6,365 --> 0:6:8,801
LUCAS: Gas that's released
from charring the wood


150
0:6:8,801 --> 0:6:10,69
will go to the filter,


151
0:6:10,69 --> 0:6:12,504
and then that will
filter out the liquid from it,


152
0:6:12,504 --> 0:6:13,672
and then it will go
to the generator,


153
0:6:13,672 --> 0:6:16,108
and we can fire up
the generator off of it.


154
0:6:16,108 --> 0:6:17,943
We want a lot of heat.


155
0:6:17,943 --> 0:6:20,479
I want this thing
to look like pit barbecue.


156
0:6:20,479 --> 0:6:22,581
Once you get to 451 degrees,


157
0:6:22,581 --> 0:6:25,551
we're going to start
making wood gas.


158
0:6:25,551 --> 0:6:26,552
We're almost there.


159
0:6:26,552 --> 0:6:27,82
MAN: Yeah, we're getting there.


160
0:6:27,82 --> 0:6:33,258
LUCAS: Looks awesome.
Looks awesome. I love it.


161
0:6:33,258 --> 0:6:35,93
MAN: C'mon, buddy.


162
0:6:35,93 --> 0:6:36,529
We got it running.


163
0:6:36,529 --> 0:6:37,763
LUCAS: As this runs,


164
0:6:37,763 --> 0:6:42,435
you can power a battery charger
off of this unit.


165
0:6:42,435 --> 0:6:44,203
And you can have
an unlimited amount of power


166
0:6:44,203 --> 0:6:50,242
as long as you have wood
to power the generator.


167
0:6:50,242 --> 0:6:52,345
NARRATOR:
Lucas is also constructing


168
0:6:52,345 --> 0:6:54,79
a vertical wind turbine,


169
0:6:54,79 --> 0:6:56,182
which they'll use
to charge batteries.


170
0:6:56,182 --> 0:6:58,117
LUCAS: This vertical axis
wind turbine that we built


171
0:6:58,117 --> 0:7:1,386
was made out of stove flashing
and some flat bar.


172
0:7:1,386 --> 0:7:4,923
This is a vehicle AC motor
and squirrel cage.


173
0:7:4,923 --> 0:7:6,559
It can be very useful


174
0:7:6,559 --> 0:7:9,828
in a situation where
you need portable power.


175
0:7:9,828 --> 0:7:11,697
NARRATOR: When it comes to food,


176
0:7:11,697 --> 0:7:15,968
Lucas already has 5 goats,
20 chickens, and 40 cows


177
0:7:15,968 --> 0:7:18,7
ready for doomsday.


178
0:7:18,7 --> 0:7:19,672
But finding a way


179
0:7:19,672 --> 0:7:22,775
to keep all their stored food
secure through an earthquake


180
0:7:22,775 --> 0:7:26,278
is another one of Lucas'
current top priorities.


181
0:7:26,278 --> 0:7:28,447
So he
and the Seven Trumpet Preppers


182
0:7:28,447 --> 0:7:31,684
are trying to make their
storage area earthquake-proof.


183
0:7:31,684 --> 0:7:34,453
LUCAS: I'll hold it
while you cut on her.


184
0:7:34,453 --> 0:7:35,588
What we're doing today


185
0:7:35,588 --> 0:7:39,224
is securing the shelves together
with L-brackets.


186
0:7:39,224 --> 0:7:41,193
This will stop the sway
in the shelves


187
0:7:41,193 --> 0:7:42,394
when an earthquake comes


188
0:7:42,394 --> 0:7:43,996
and also help to stop them
from falling over


189
0:7:43,996 --> 0:7:45,797
and spilling our stored product.


190
0:7:45,797 --> 0:7:47,299
Also on the back,


191
0:7:47,299 --> 0:7:50,436
they're being affixed to the
wall and the concrete block


192
0:7:50,436 --> 0:7:52,638
so that no food falls out
or is busted


193
0:7:52,638 --> 0:7:55,341
from coming off the shelf.


194
0:7:55,341 --> 0:7:57,243
NARRATOR: Lucas' plan
is to stock these shelves


195
0:7:57,243 --> 0:7:59,645
with 3.5 years' worth of food,


196
0:7:59,645 --> 0:8:2,482
which he believes will be
enough to last a group of 20


197
0:8:2,482 --> 0:8:5,717
through the worst
of a New Madrid quake.


198
0:8:5,717 --> 0:8:9,421
LUCAS: My wife Nikki takes care
of most of the food dehydration


199
0:8:9,421 --> 0:8:11,323
so that we can have them
stored on the shelves


200
0:8:11,323 --> 0:8:12,524
if we ever need them.


201
0:8:12,524 --> 0:8:14,66
WOMAN:
Barbeque sauce with chicken.


202
0:8:14,66 --> 0:8:16,61
NIKKI: Oh, that's my favorite.


203
0:8:16,61 --> 0:8:17,763
WOMAN: Beef enchilada.


204
0:8:17,763 --> 0:8:19,732
LUCAS: This is one
of our food caches


205
0:8:19,732 --> 0:8:23,435
that we're putting MREs
and rice stores back.


206
0:8:23,435 --> 0:8:25,537
And this will be
not only to benefit us


207
0:8:25,537 --> 0:8:28,708
but some others nearby,
neighbors in the community,


208
0:8:28,708 --> 0:8:31,81
just in case things
get terribly out of hand.


209
0:8:31,81 --> 0:8:35,114
GRANDMA: Why is there
not brown rice up here?


210
0:8:35,114 --> 0:8:37,116
NIKKI: Because
the white rice keeps longer


211
0:8:37,116 --> 0:8:39,18
than the brown rice.


212
0:8:39,18 --> 0:8:40,119
NARRATOR: Although he believes


213
0:8:40,119 --> 0:8:42,21
this storage area
within the Alamo


214
0:8:42,21 --> 0:8:44,323
will survive a massive quake,


215
0:8:44,323 --> 0:8:48,561
Lucas has also concealed another
400 to 500 pounds of food


216
0:8:48,561 --> 0:8:51,563
in two different hidden
locations around the farm.


217
0:8:51,563 --> 0:8:54,266
LUCAS: We've been very careful
to divide our food stores up,


218
0:8:54,266 --> 0:8:56,602
not only for OPSEC,


219
0:8:56,602 --> 0:8:58,137
but for the fact
that if for some reason


220
0:8:58,137 --> 0:9:0,372
one of them was lost,


221
0:9:0,372 --> 0:9:4,376
we would have plenty of other
food at other locations.


222
0:9:4,376 --> 0:9:7,79
NARRATOR: Lucas is storing
enough food for 20 people


223
0:9:7,79 --> 0:9:9,915
because he has a master plan
to expand his ranks


224
0:9:9,915 --> 0:9:14,186
and create
a formidable prepping force.


225
0:9:14,186 --> 0:9:16,722
But when it comes
to new recruits,


226
0:9:16,722 --> 0:9:18,423
Lucas is very demanding.


227
0:9:18,423 --> 0:9:20,659
LUCAS: To have someone
on my safe list,


228
0:9:20,659 --> 0:9:23,162
they would've had to done
something for me in my past.


229
0:9:23,162 --> 0:9:25,97
This would have to be
trusted people I've known


230
0:9:25,97 --> 0:9:28,3
and have done only good deeds
toward other people.


231
0:9:28,3 --> 0:9:30,202
NARRATOR: And his newest
potential member


232
0:9:30,202 --> 0:9:32,938
may not be able
to handle the stress...


233
0:9:32,938 --> 0:9:35,24
MAN: Contact, rear!


234
0:9:35,24 --> 0:9:43,382
NARRATOR: ...of being
a Seven Trumpets Prepper.


235
0:9:43,382 --> 0:9:44,483
NARRATOR: Lucas Cameron


236
0:9:44,483 --> 0:9:46,351
is preparing
for a biblical earthquake


237
0:9:46,351 --> 0:9:48,421
along the New Madrid
fault system


238
0:9:48,421 --> 0:9:51,39
by turning his 26-acre farm
in Tennessee


239
0:9:51,39 --> 0:9:54,993
into a safe haven for himself,
his family, and his neighbors.


240
0:9:54,993 --> 0:10:0,732
LUCAS: I spend thousands
of dollars a year prepping.


241
0:10:0,732 --> 0:10:2,601
This farm has everything we need


242
0:10:2,601 --> 0:10:4,87
for whenever the great
earthquake takes place.


243
0:10:4,87 --> 0:10:6,171
NARRATOR: Lucas fears


244
0:10:6,171 --> 0:10:8,374
that some of those who
have not prepared as he has


245
0:10:8,374 --> 0:10:9,909
will turn into marauders


246
0:10:9,909 --> 0:10:12,44
in the aftermath
of a great quake,


247
0:10:12,44 --> 0:10:13,913
and descend on his Alamo,


248
0:10:13,913 --> 0:10:16,815
looking to plunder his preps.


249
0:10:16,815 --> 0:10:18,917
So to ensure he always has
enough ammunition


250
0:10:18,917 --> 0:10:20,919
to combat
the threat of looters,


251
0:10:20,919 --> 0:10:25,19
Lucas plans
to manufacture his own.


252
0:10:25,19 --> 0:10:27,727
Today, he and his father, Mike,


253
0:10:27,727 --> 0:10:30,529
are teaching Lucas'
7-year-old son, Jonathan,


254
0:10:30,529 --> 0:10:32,998
how to reload ammo.


255
0:10:32,998 --> 0:10:35,901
LUCAS: The reason it's important
to know how to do this


256
0:10:35,901 --> 0:10:38,36
is because one day,
whenever you can't get ammo,


257
0:10:38,36 --> 0:10:39,571
you might need
to make it for yourself


258
0:10:39,571 --> 0:10:41,874
so that you can hunt
or protect yourself with it.


259
0:10:41,874 --> 0:10:43,775
My son, Jonathan,
is 7 years old,


260
0:10:43,775 --> 0:10:46,812
and I intend to teach him
all that I can.


261
0:10:46,812 --> 0:10:49,748
MIKE: Every time you come down,
come all the way down.


262
0:10:49,748 --> 0:10:51,716
Very good.


263
0:10:51,716 --> 0:10:53,585
All right, now,
that starts the crimp.


264
0:10:53,585 --> 0:10:56,622
Congratulations! Your first
loaded 12-gauge shell.


265
0:10:56,622 --> 0:10:57,956
Let's see it.


266
0:10:57,956 --> 0:11:0,759
Got to make sure that
the primer is always flush.


267
0:11:0,759 --> 0:11:2,961
LUCAS: It's crimping good.


268
0:11:2,961 --> 0:11:6,298
What's the only purpose
guns are good for?


269
0:11:6,298 --> 0:11:10,1
JONATHAN: Killing people
that are trying to kill you.


270
0:11:10,1 --> 0:11:17,9
MIKE: Guns are just weapons.
They're like a carpenter's saw.


271
0:11:17,9 --> 0:11:22,147
But we like 'em, don't we?


272
0:11:22,147 --> 0:11:25,784
All right.


273
0:11:25,784 --> 0:11:29,12
NARRATOR: To bolster the ranks
of the Seven Trumpet Preppers,


274
0:11:29,12 --> 0:11:32,324
Lucas is now looking for other
trustworthy local preppers


275
0:11:32,324 --> 0:11:37,29
who can bring
specific skills to the group.


276
0:11:37,29 --> 0:11:39,565
LUCAS: There'll be those
that take care of security,


277
0:11:39,565 --> 0:11:41,834
those that take care
of the farming operation,


278
0:11:41,834 --> 0:11:43,402
and others that will
be in charge of things


279
0:11:43,402 --> 0:11:45,537
such as power supply.


280
0:11:45,537 --> 0:11:47,105
NARRATOR:
One potential new candidate


281
0:11:47,105 --> 0:11:52,377
recently moved
only 35 miles away.


282
0:11:52,377 --> 0:11:56,214
Kevin O'Brien
is a father of four.


283
0:11:56,214 --> 0:11:58,316
He regularly
takes his family camping


284
0:11:58,316 --> 0:12:0,385
in the wilds
of eastern Tennessee.


285
0:12:0,385 --> 0:12:1,586
KEVIN O'BRIEN:
All right, everyone out.


286
0:12:1,586 --> 0:12:3,55
We got camping to do.


287
0:12:3,55 --> 0:12:5,19
NARRATOR: His children
don't particularly enjoy


288
0:12:5,19 --> 0:12:6,692
these camping trips.


289
0:12:6,692 --> 0:12:9,294
KEVIN: You like camping.
You excited to camp?


290
0:12:9,294 --> 0:12:11,196
WOMAN: She's never excited.


291
0:12:11,196 --> 0:12:12,464
KEVIN: No, you don't like
camping, do you?


292
0:12:12,464 --> 0:12:14,199
WOMAN: Manual labor.
KEVIN: I know.


293
0:12:14,199 --> 0:12:17,403
NARRATOR: But Kevin insists
on coming back again and again.


294
0:12:17,403 --> 0:12:21,4
That's because this isn't
a typical campsite.


295
0:12:21,4 --> 0:12:24,409
This is their new home.


296
0:12:24,409 --> 0:12:26,278
KEVIN: We moved
from Florida to Tennessee


297
0:12:26,278 --> 0:12:27,646
to avoid worldwide destruction


298
0:12:27,646 --> 0:12:33,51
from the effects
of a pole shift.


299
0:12:33,51 --> 0:12:35,921
GIRL: Hello.


300
0:12:35,921 --> 0:12:38,59
NARRATOR: Last season
on "Doomsday Preppers,"


301
0:12:38,59 --> 0:12:41,59
Kevin O'Brien
moved his entire family


302
0:12:41,59 --> 0:12:42,762
from Jacksonville, Florida,


303
0:12:42,762 --> 0:12:45,231
to the remote hills
of eastern Tennessee


304
0:12:45,231 --> 0:12:48,0
in an attempt
to escape the apocalypse.


305
0:12:48,0 --> 0:12:49,268
KEVIN: I think
I owe it to my family


306
0:12:49,268 --> 0:12:50,635
to do everything I can
to keep them safe


307
0:12:50,635 --> 0:12:52,504
and out of harm's way.


308
0:12:52,504 --> 0:12:55,44
NARRATOR: Kevin was determined
to get his family out of Florida


309
0:12:55,44 --> 0:12:58,144
because he thinks
it will wind up underwater


310
0:12:58,144 --> 0:13:1,13
in the event of
a catastrophic polar shift.


311
0:13:1,13 --> 0:13:2,448
KEVIN:
When the polar shift happens,


312
0:13:2,448 --> 0:13:4,65
we're going to see
rising sea levels,


313
0:13:4,65 --> 0:13:6,651
earthquakes, volcanoes,


314
0:13:6,651 --> 0:13:9,254
tsunamis bouncing off
coasts back and forth.


315
0:13:9,254 --> 0:13:11,69
Entire countries
might be underwater.


316
0:13:11,69 --> 0:13:16,695
Florida might find itself maybe
where Alaska used to be.


317
0:13:16,695 --> 0:13:19,864
NARRATOR: But not all of Kevin's
family shared his beliefs,


318
0:13:19,864 --> 0:13:24,836
or his desire to uproot
and move 540 miles from home.


319
0:13:24,836 --> 0:13:27,72
WOMAN: Are you looking forward
to moving at all?


320
0:13:27,72 --> 0:13:29,741
GIRL: No.
WOMAN: Not at all?


321
0:13:29,741 --> 0:13:30,942
KEVIN: Our oldest, Hailey,


322
0:13:30,942 --> 0:13:32,711
she's getting
into the teen years,


323
0:13:32,711 --> 0:13:36,448
doesn't want to uproot
and leave her friends behind.


324
0:13:36,448 --> 0:13:40,18
WOMAN: A lot of our family
thinks we're crazy.


325
0:13:40,18 --> 0:13:42,654
A lot of our friends
think we're crazy.


326
0:13:42,654 --> 0:13:46,591
HAILEY: Well, we are crazy.


327
0:13:46,591 --> 0:13:49,328
NARRATOR: Despite
their kids' protestations,


328
0:13:49,328 --> 0:13:51,797
Kevin and Amie
packed up their belongings,


329
0:13:51,797 --> 0:13:56,701
along with their 2,000 pounds
of food, ammo, and energy preps,


330
0:13:56,701 --> 0:13:59,104
and set out
on a nine-hour journey


331
0:13:59,104 --> 0:14:1,673
from Florida to Tennessee.


332
0:14:1,673 --> 0:14:4,81
But nearly a year
after their move,


333
0:14:4,81 --> 0:14:7,145
the 130-acre plot of land


334
0:14:7,145 --> 0:14:9,848
that was supposed to become
their prepper paradise


335
0:14:9,848 --> 0:14:11,683
is still just an empty lot.


336
0:14:11,683 --> 0:14:13,152
KEVIN: Prepping costs money.


337
0:14:13,152 --> 0:14:14,653
The move up to Tennessee,
you know,


338
0:14:14,653 --> 0:14:16,588
kind of put us
in a hurt locker a little bit.


339
0:14:16,588 --> 0:14:19,258
We put a nice chunk of change
down for the land.


340
0:14:19,258 --> 0:14:22,6
We don't have the cash on hand
to build a house ourselves.


341
0:14:22,6 --> 0:14:25,43
NARRATOR: Instead, the O'Briens
have been renting a house nearby


342
0:14:25,43 --> 0:14:27,599
and making regular camping trips
to their land


343
0:14:27,599 --> 0:14:30,102
to get their kids
used to the area.


344
0:14:30,102 --> 0:14:31,103
KEVIN: Camping once again


345
0:14:31,103 --> 0:14:32,471
to kind of get used
to the property


346
0:14:32,471 --> 0:14:35,4
and know our way around.


347
0:14:35,4 --> 0:14:36,841
HAILEY: There's no toilet.


348
0:14:36,841 --> 0:14:38,11
There's no shower.


349
0:14:38,11 --> 0:14:40,945
No sink.


350
0:14:40,945 --> 0:14:44,716
And it's terrible.


351
0:14:44,716 --> 0:14:46,852
Toilets were made for a reason.


352
0:14:46,852 --> 0:14:48,286
Use them.


353
0:14:48,286 --> 0:14:50,522
KEVIN: It'll be fun.
You'll enjoy it.


354
0:14:50,522 --> 0:14:51,857
It'll grow on you.


355
0:14:51,857 --> 0:14:53,458
We'd like to build
a really solid home,


356
0:14:53,458 --> 0:14:55,827
probably out of
reinforced concrete--


357
0:14:55,827 --> 0:14:59,64
bulletproof, waterproof,
fireproof, earthquake proof,


358
0:14:59,64 --> 0:15:1,5
and ultimately,
pole shift proof.


359
0:15:1,5 --> 0:15:3,635
BOY: When are we getting
the house built?


360
0:15:3,635 --> 0:15:5,137
KEVIN: Hopefully
in the next six months,


361
0:15:5,137 --> 0:15:8,74
if all goes according to plan.


362
0:15:8,74 --> 0:15:11,43
My real main fear now


363
0:15:11,43 --> 0:15:13,245
is just am I gonna be able
to get the things in place


364
0:15:13,245 --> 0:15:17,15
that I want to have in place
by the time something happens?


365
0:15:17,15 --> 0:15:18,45
NARRATOR:
Not having enough money yet


366
0:15:18,45 --> 0:15:20,152
to build his prepper dream home


367
0:15:20,152 --> 0:15:22,42
hasn't slowed Kevin down.


368
0:15:22,42 --> 0:15:24,355
Even with limited resources,


369
0:15:24,355 --> 0:15:27,726
he still spends
20 to 25 hours a week


370
0:15:27,726 --> 0:15:29,61
filling their rental house


371
0:15:29,61 --> 0:15:32,53
with preps he thinks
they'll need for a polar shift.


372
0:15:32,53 --> 0:15:36,1
AMIE: We have enough rice
to last forever.


373
0:15:36,1 --> 0:15:37,836
But the thing is
Kevin doesn't even eat rice.


374
0:15:37,836 --> 0:15:39,37
He hates it.


375
0:15:39,37 --> 0:15:40,973
Everything goes to prepping.


376
0:15:40,973 --> 0:15:42,974
There's no leisure.


377
0:15:42,974 --> 0:15:47,212
I don't think we've ever really
been on a family vacation.


378
0:15:47,212 --> 0:15:52,16
We've gone to see his family
in New Jersey for a funeral,


379
0:15:52,16 --> 0:15:54,386
and Kevin counts that
as vacation.


380
0:15:54,386 --> 0:15:57,889
I wish that Kevin
could find a balance.


381
0:15:57,889 --> 0:16:2,94
You can still prepare for all
the bad things that can happen


382
0:16:2,94 --> 0:16:4,763
and still enjoy your life now.


383
0:16:4,763 --> 0:16:8,7
Just go to a movie with us,
or play a game.


384
0:16:8,7 --> 0:16:10,335
NARRATOR:
But instead of movie night,


385
0:16:10,335 --> 0:16:13,205
tonight, Kevin's
quality time with the kids


386
0:16:13,205 --> 0:16:15,34
is showing them how to make
first-aid kits


387
0:16:15,34 --> 0:16:16,441
for their bug-out bags.


388
0:16:16,441 --> 0:16:18,76
KEVIN: It's important
for each of you


389
0:16:18,76 --> 0:16:19,544
to have your own first-aid kit.


390
0:16:19,544 --> 0:16:22,181
In case we get separated,
you've got your own supplies.


391
0:16:22,181 --> 0:16:24,549
NARRATOR: Kevin believes
that after a polar shift,


392
0:16:24,549 --> 0:16:26,351
hospitals will be overrun,


393
0:16:26,351 --> 0:16:28,486
and medical supplies
will be scarce.


394
0:16:28,486 --> 0:16:30,556
KEVIN: Pull out your Band-Aids.


395
0:16:30,556 --> 0:16:32,657
NARRATOR: So he's been
stockpiling first-aid supplies


396
0:16:32,657 --> 0:16:33,959
for months.


397
0:16:33,959 --> 0:16:35,527
KEVIN: We're gonna
put these in the metal tins


398
0:16:35,527 --> 0:16:40,132
because they won't get crushed
as easy inside the bag.


399
0:16:40,132 --> 0:16:41,967
And once the lid's
snapped on them,


400
0:16:41,967 --> 0:16:44,936
it'll be pretty close
to waterproof.


401
0:16:44,936 --> 0:16:47,572
Hey, if you want to be up
all night doing this, fine,


402
0:16:47,572 --> 0:16:48,974
but otherwise
let's pay attention


403
0:16:48,974 --> 0:16:52,277
and we can move on
to the next thing.


404
0:16:52,277 --> 0:16:54,479
BOY: Our friends...


405
0:16:54,479 --> 0:16:57,316
if we talk about
pole shifts and stuff,


406
0:16:57,316 --> 0:16:59,952
they would think,
"They are crazy."


407
0:16:59,952 --> 0:17:2,187
KEVIN: All right, so everyone
put your lids on them.


408
0:17:2,187 --> 0:17:4,89
We're all done. Good job.


409
0:17:4,89 --> 0:17:6,792
All right!
Now that we've got that done,


410
0:17:6,792 --> 0:17:8,927
I've got a little present
for you guys.


411
0:17:8,927 --> 0:17:10,462
NARRATOR: While Kevin
believes Tennessee


412
0:17:10,462 --> 0:17:12,931
is much safer than
Florida overall,


413
0:17:12,931 --> 0:17:15,466
there are two nuclear plants
in the state.


414
0:17:15,466 --> 0:17:17,302
KEVIN: Gas masks.


415
0:17:17,302 --> 0:17:19,338
GIRL: Can we try it on?


416
0:17:19,338 --> 0:17:20,672
NARRATOR:
Both of which he believes


417
0:17:20,672 --> 0:17:23,975
will be vulnerable to meltdown
during a polar shift.


418
0:17:23,975 --> 0:17:25,644
KEVIN: You've got
the nuclear accident


419
0:17:25,644 --> 0:17:29,748
as a result of the tsunami
over there in Japan.


420
0:17:29,748 --> 0:17:34,52
The mask filters out any kind
of harmful radioactive debris.


421
0:17:34,52 --> 0:17:36,121
And after like a polar shift,


422
0:17:36,121 --> 0:17:37,756
you're gonna want
stuff like that


423
0:17:37,756 --> 0:17:40,391
if you have to go out and about.


424
0:17:40,391 --> 0:17:42,261
GIRL: Hello.


425
0:17:42,261 --> 0:17:43,862
HAILEY: Hello.


426
0:17:43,862 --> 0:17:46,832
I believe
a polar shift will happen.


427
0:17:46,832 --> 0:17:49,234
I just don't believe
it'll have any effect


428
0:17:49,234 --> 0:17:51,2
on our geographical locations,


429
0:17:51,2 --> 0:17:54,206
and I honestly don't think we
have anything to worry about.


430
0:17:54,206 --> 0:17:55,807
NARRATOR:
Since Kevin's not getting


431
0:17:55,807 --> 0:17:57,608
his family's full support,


432
0:17:57,608 --> 0:18:0,612
he's on a mission to connect
with other like-minded preppers


433
0:18:0,612 --> 0:18:3,48
willing to help him survive
a polar shift.


434
0:18:3,48 --> 0:18:4,75
LUCAS: How we doin'?


435
0:18:4,75 --> 0:18:6,17
NARRATOR: But when he hooks up


436
0:18:6,17 --> 0:18:8,654
with Lucas'
Seven Trumpet Preppers online


437
0:18:8,654 --> 0:18:10,555
and tries to join their group,


438
0:18:10,555 --> 0:18:15,6
the initiation test may be
much more than he can handle.


439
0:18:15,6 --> 0:18:20,298
LUCAS: Cut 'em off!
Cut 'em off!


440
0:18:20,298 --> 0:18:21,499
NARRATOR: Kevin O'Brien


441
0:18:21,499 --> 0:18:23,869
has moved his wife
and four reluctant kids...


442
0:18:23,869 --> 0:18:26,404
AMIE: Are you excited to move?
GIRL: No!


443
0:18:26,404 --> 0:18:29,808
NARRATOR: ...540 miles
from Florida to Tennessee


444
0:18:29,808 --> 0:18:33,612
because he fears
the world is about to end.


445
0:18:33,612 --> 0:18:38,283
But his family believes he may
be taking his prepping too far.


446
0:18:38,283 --> 0:18:40,419
AMIE: I don't think
Kevin understands


447
0:18:40,419 --> 0:18:44,122
that this is kind of like
a lonely lifestyle.


448
0:18:44,122 --> 0:18:47,592
You don't have a whole lot
of people to talk to about it.


449
0:18:47,592 --> 0:18:51,29
My kids don't want people
knowing that we're preppers.


450
0:18:51,29 --> 0:18:53,565
They get embarrassed.


451
0:18:53,565 --> 0:18:55,934
NARRATOR:
With only grudging cooperation


452
0:18:55,934 --> 0:18:57,469
from his wife and kids,


453
0:18:57,469 --> 0:18:59,938
Kevin's been looking
outside the family


454
0:18:59,938 --> 0:19:1,907
for the support he craves.


455
0:19:1,907 --> 0:19:5,911
He's created a website, hoping
to find like-minded locals.


456
0:19:5,911 --> 0:19:7,545
KEVIN: If I have to make friends
all over again


457
0:19:7,545 --> 0:19:9,615
and meet new people and network,


458
0:19:9,615 --> 0:19:11,983
I might as well
try to meet fellow preppers,


459
0:19:11,983 --> 0:19:15,92
so this website kind of is a way
to bring preppers together.


460
0:19:15,92 --> 0:19:19,391
We're up to 152 preppers
as members.


461
0:19:19,391 --> 0:19:21,126
It makes you feel
really not alone.


462
0:19:21,126 --> 0:19:25,63
One of the first people
to join was Lucas.


463
0:19:25,63 --> 0:19:26,431
NARRATOR: Unlike Kevin,


464
0:19:26,431 --> 0:19:30,835
Lucas Cameron already has
a tight-knit prepping group.


465
0:19:30,835 --> 0:19:34,38
They call themselves
the Seven Trumpet Preppers.


466
0:19:34,38 --> 0:19:36,575
LUCAS: As a community
of preppers, we do many things.


467
0:19:36,575 --> 0:19:38,142
We store food together,


468
0:19:38,142 --> 0:19:41,12
we do operational security
training together,


469
0:19:41,12 --> 0:19:42,614
and we make sure
to be medically prepped.


470
0:19:42,614 --> 0:19:44,516
NARRATOR: Kevin's asked Lucas


471
0:19:44,516 --> 0:19:47,118
if he can join
the Seven Trumpet Preppers


472
0:19:47,118 --> 0:19:50,54
and work together
to survive the apocalypse.


473
0:19:50,54 --> 0:19:53,124
KEVIN: Lucas has got a whole
community going over there.


474
0:19:53,124 --> 0:19:55,193
I will actually be
going out to his place,


475
0:19:55,193 --> 0:19:57,228
out to his farm to meet him.


476
0:19:57,228 --> 0:19:59,965
LUCAS: Welcome to
my humble abode, neighbor.


477
0:19:59,965 --> 0:20:1,9
NARRATOR:
Today, Lucas has invited Kevin


478
0:20:1,9 --> 0:20:4,402
to visit his compound
for the first time.


479
0:20:4,402 --> 0:20:6,504
LUCAS: You got the whole army
with you today.


480
0:20:6,504 --> 0:20:8,172
KEVIN: Yeah, I brought the clan.


481
0:20:8,172 --> 0:20:9,708
LUCAS: Hey, how we doing today?


482
0:20:9,708 --> 0:20:12,21
KEVIN: It was nice to kind of
be invited to go out over there


483
0:20:12,21 --> 0:20:15,18
and see what they had going on
and then swap ideas.


484
0:20:15,18 --> 0:20:16,247
NARRATOR: But today's meeting


485
0:20:16,247 --> 0:20:18,684
isn't just about
making new friends.


486
0:20:18,684 --> 0:20:19,851
Before deciding whether or not


487
0:20:19,851 --> 0:20:22,87
to admit the O'Briens
into his group,


488
0:20:22,87 --> 0:20:24,923
Lucas wants to test
their defensive skills


489
0:20:24,923 --> 0:20:27,359
and make sure they can
carry their own weight.


490
0:20:27,359 --> 0:20:29,461
KEVIN: So you guys are already
loaded and ready to go, huh?


491
0:20:29,461 --> 0:20:41,773
LUCAS: Hey, we're...
Take your time, neighbor.


492
0:20:41,773 --> 0:20:45,377
KEVIN: All right, here we go.


493
0:20:45,377 --> 0:20:46,878
NARRATOR: As Lucas' group


494
0:20:46,878 --> 0:20:49,781
assesses the O'Briens'
performance on the gun range,


495
0:20:49,781 --> 0:20:52,451
Kevin is eager to prove
that he and his family


496
0:20:52,451 --> 0:20:54,752
can bring valuable skills
to the table.


497
0:20:54,752 --> 0:20:56,2
KEVIN: Thanks for having us over


498
0:20:56,2 --> 0:20:58,323
and letting us fire some rounds
off in the gun range


499
0:20:58,323 --> 0:21:0,358
and, you know,
we're kind of new to the area,


500
0:21:0,358 --> 0:21:3,262
so we want to get to know
other preppers in the area.


501
0:21:3,262 --> 0:21:4,896
NARRATOR:
But the Seven Trumpet Preppers


502
0:21:4,896 --> 0:21:7,866
want Kevin to understand
that becoming one of them


503
0:21:7,866 --> 0:21:10,768
requires more than just
proficiency with a firearm.


504
0:21:10,768 --> 0:21:12,604
BRIAN:
Eventually, you will learn


505
0:21:12,604 --> 0:21:14,605
how each of your people walk.


506
0:21:14,605 --> 0:21:16,74
At a distance, you're like,


507
0:21:16,74 --> 0:21:18,176
"Man, they all look the same.
Who is that?"


508
0:21:18,176 --> 0:21:19,51
"That's so and so,


509
0:21:19,51 --> 0:21:20,712
'cause I can tell
by the way he's walking."


510
0:21:20,712 --> 0:21:22,8
You learn how
they carry themselves.


511
0:21:22,8 --> 0:21:23,915
That's important details
to pay attention to.


512
0:21:23,915 --> 0:21:25,116
NARRATOR:
Lucas still isn't convinced


513
0:21:25,116 --> 0:21:27,185
Kevin is the right man
for the job.


514
0:21:27,185 --> 0:21:30,588
In his opinion, the true measure
of a Seven Trumpet Prepper


515
0:21:30,588 --> 0:21:34,459
is how much he's willing to give
to protect the group.


516
0:21:34,459 --> 0:21:35,927
LUCAS:
For Kevin to make the cut,


517
0:21:35,927 --> 0:21:38,263
he would have to prove to us
that he'd more than willing


518
0:21:38,263 --> 0:21:40,298
to take up
and help protect this place


519
0:21:40,298 --> 0:21:42,934
if in need or in a threat.


520
0:21:42,934 --> 0:21:45,103
NARRATOR:
So Lucas has arranged an event


521
0:21:45,103 --> 0:21:47,739
that will not only test
Kevin's defensive skills,


522
0:21:47,739 --> 0:21:50,142
but his own group's
security training as well.


523
0:21:50,142 --> 0:21:52,244
LUCAS: We're gonna have
a mock raid on the farm


524
0:21:52,244 --> 0:21:54,45
and test
our operational security.


525
0:21:54,45 --> 0:21:55,78
Do you want to be part of that?


526
0:21:55,78 --> 0:21:57,315
KEVIN: Yeah, that sounds
real interesting.


527
0:21:57,315 --> 0:21:59,317
LUCAS: Awesome.


528
0:21:59,317 --> 0:22:1,886
NARRATOR: Lucas has invited
the prepping experts,


529
0:22:1,886 --> 0:22:4,589
David Kobler and Scott Hunt
from Practical Preppers,


530
0:22:4,589 --> 0:22:7,525
to conduct a mock raid
on the Alamo


531
0:22:7,525 --> 0:22:10,728
during one of their
nighttime supply runs.


532
0:22:10,728 --> 0:22:12,864
DAVID: We're going to evaluate
his perimeter today.


533
0:22:12,864 --> 0:22:14,132
We're going to see how he reacts


534
0:22:14,132 --> 0:22:16,768
to some hostile forces
coming against him,


535
0:22:16,768 --> 0:22:18,169
see if he reacts properly,


536
0:22:18,169 --> 0:22:19,704
see if he actually
if he's proactive


537
0:22:19,704 --> 0:22:23,774
and he comes after us
to make sure he's secure.


538
0:22:23,774 --> 0:22:27,12
Nighttime is the hardest thing
to do an operation.


539
0:22:27,12 --> 0:22:29,581
It's hard for us to sneak in,


540
0:22:29,581 --> 0:22:32,484
but it's also very hard for him
to defend his property.


541
0:22:32,484 --> 0:22:34,586
NARRATOR: Practical Preppers
don't know the terrain,


542
0:22:34,586 --> 0:22:36,688
but they're equipped with
the latest in night vision,


543
0:22:36,688 --> 0:22:39,991
communications,
and tactical gear.


544
0:22:39,991 --> 0:22:42,627
Lucas' team
has home field advantage,


545
0:22:42,627 --> 0:22:45,97
but none of Practical
Preppers' modern technology.


546
0:22:45,97 --> 0:22:46,998
LUCAS: We're runnin' tonight
with no coms


547
0:22:46,998 --> 0:22:48,7
so there won't be no chatter.


548
0:22:48,7 --> 0:22:51,87
It's just all yell commands,
voice commands only.


549
0:22:51,87 --> 0:22:54,138
NARRATOR:
Practical Preppers' objective


550
0:22:54,138 --> 0:22:56,273
is to get within
a 4-foot perimeter.


551
0:22:56,273 --> 0:22:59,61
They believe anyone able to get
that close in a real attack


552
0:22:59,61 --> 0:23:1,812
would be able to kill
the inhabitants.


553
0:23:1,812 --> 0:23:4,482
SCOTT:
If we get close to his home,


554
0:23:4,482 --> 0:23:7,786
his location, where his wife,
his children, his supplies are,


555
0:23:7,786 --> 0:23:11,956
then he has lost,
he's lost the battle.


556
0:23:11,956 --> 0:23:14,86
NARRATOR: It will be Kevin's
responsibility during the attack


557
0:23:14,86 --> 0:23:17,362
to drive up
to receive the food transfer


558
0:23:17,362 --> 0:23:19,197
and act as watchman.


559
0:23:19,197 --> 0:23:21,433
KEVIN: So what's the game plan?


560
0:23:21,433 --> 0:23:23,602
LUCAS: We don't know exactly
where they're gonna hit from,


561
0:23:23,602 --> 0:23:25,97
but it's gonna take place
during the transaction,


562
0:23:25,97 --> 0:23:30,308
while we're loading you supplies
to help your community.


563
0:23:30,308 --> 0:23:31,843
MAN: So mostly
just stay with the vehicle.


564
0:23:31,843 --> 0:23:33,344
Let us be security team.


565
0:23:33,344 --> 0:23:35,514
KEVIN: I'm kind of the outsider.


566
0:23:35,514 --> 0:23:37,815
They've know each other
for a very long time


567
0:23:37,815 --> 0:23:41,72
so they really don't know,
you know, what I'm all about.


568
0:23:41,72 --> 0:23:43,621
So, they're gonna get to see
how I react


569
0:23:43,621 --> 0:23:48,859
under a, you know,
stressful situation.


570
0:23:48,859 --> 0:23:53,931
NARRATOR: As the sky darkens,
Kevin takes his position.


571
0:23:53,931 --> 0:23:56,234
LUCAS: Contact, rear!


572
0:23:56,234 --> 0:23:58,437
Need some covering fire!


573
0:23:58,437 --> 0:24:0,605
NARRATOR: But in the heat
of the moment,


574
0:24:0,605 --> 0:24:2,44
will he earn his stripes,


575
0:24:2,44 --> 0:24:9,68
or crack under the pressure?


576
0:24:9,68 --> 0:24:13,84
NARRATOR: Kevin O'Brien is
in the midst of a combat drill


577
0:24:13,84 --> 0:24:14,653
that will determine
whether or not


578
0:24:14,653 --> 0:24:18,723
he's accepted into Lucas
Cameron's prepper network.


579
0:24:18,723 --> 0:24:19,824
Kevin's assignment:


580
0:24:19,824 --> 0:24:23,94
protect the food transfer
from ambush.


581
0:24:23,94 --> 0:24:24,962
With the help
of night-vision goggles,


582
0:24:24,962 --> 0:24:26,965
Practical Preppers'
assault team


583
0:24:26,965 --> 0:24:30,968
is creeping toward the compound
under cover of darkness.


584
0:24:30,968 --> 0:24:32,37
Lucas' team


585
0:24:32,37 --> 0:24:35,173
attempts to take away
Practical Preppers' advantage


586
0:24:35,173 --> 0:24:37,208
by sweeping the area
with flashlights


587
0:24:37,208 --> 0:24:40,879
to counteract
their night-vision goggles.


588
0:24:40,879 --> 0:24:45,35
But this also gives away
Lucas' team's positions.


589
0:24:45,35 --> 0:24:48,92
DAVID: I see a guy with
a flashlight in the front.


590
0:24:48,92 --> 0:24:53,524
Let's go.


591
0:24:53,524 --> 0:24:55,86
We knew exactly where they are.


592
0:24:55,86 --> 0:24:57,195
They thought
they had the advantage


593
0:24:57,195 --> 0:24:59,864
by using that flashlight
and shining it out there,


594
0:24:59,864 --> 0:25:1,866
but it's also
a huge disadvantage.


595
0:25:1,866 --> 0:25:3,434
If we find out
where their security is,


596
0:25:3,434 --> 0:25:14,145
we can take advantage of it.


597
0:25:14,145 --> 0:25:16,381
LUCAS: Contact, rear!


598
0:25:16,381 --> 0:25:18,783
Contact!


599
0:25:18,783 --> 0:25:21,92
LUCAS: Need some covering fire!


600
0:25:21,92 --> 0:25:23,654
NARRATOR:
Knowing his responsibility


601
0:25:23,654 --> 0:25:26,57
is to protect the vehicle
during the chaos,


602
0:25:26,57 --> 0:25:31,896
Kevin holds his position.


603
0:25:31,896 --> 0:25:33,698
LUCAS: Cut him off!
Cut him off!


604
0:25:33,698 --> 0:25:35,266
NARRATOR: But as Lucas
calls out instructions


605
0:25:35,266 --> 0:25:36,7
to his other teammates,


606
0:25:36,7 --> 0:25:39,637
his gun jams,
and he's left helpless.


607
0:25:39,637 --> 0:25:40,605
LUCAS: Son of a bitch.


608
0:25:40,605 --> 0:25:42,64
Jam! Jam!


609
0:25:42,64 --> 0:25:44,542
DAVID: Let's go!
Take 'em! Take 'em!


610
0:25:44,542 --> 0:25:45,576
NARRATOR: Practical Preppers


611
0:25:45,576 --> 0:25:47,345
take advantage
of the equipment failure


612
0:25:47,345 --> 0:25:51,382
to breach the 4-foot perimeter
and stop the supply transfer.


613
0:25:51,382 --> 0:25:52,65
DAVID: We made it far up.


614
0:25:52,65 --> 0:25:53,818
We made it all the way
to the house


615
0:25:53,818 --> 0:25:55,22
and actually used their house
as cover for us


616
0:25:55,22 --> 0:25:57,388
as we shot at them.


617
0:25:57,388 --> 0:26:0,225
[bleep]


618
0:26:0,225 --> 0:26:2,93
LUCAS: Outstanding job.


619
0:26:2,93 --> 0:26:3,962
KEVIN: What'd you guys think?


620
0:26:3,962 --> 0:26:5,897
DAVID: Night vision
gives us an advantage.


621
0:26:5,897 --> 0:26:8,65
Communication
gives us an advantage.


622
0:26:8,65 --> 0:26:10,201
So definitely invest
in some radios.


623
0:26:10,201 --> 0:26:11,803
I mean, night vision
is pretty costly,


624
0:26:11,803 --> 0:26:13,738
but radios--
you can easily do those.


625
0:26:13,738 --> 0:26:16,274
SCOTT: I think the main lesson
is we got too close.


626
0:26:16,274 --> 0:26:19,76
And so they need to back up
their nighttime perimeter.


627
0:26:19,76 --> 0:26:21,212
Putting up some alerts
around the perimeter,


628
0:26:21,212 --> 0:26:23,882
they would have
picked us up a lot sooner


629
0:26:23,882 --> 0:26:25,583
and we would have never
gotten to that vehicle.


630
0:26:25,583 --> 0:26:27,151
LUCAS: I definitely
learned a lot


631
0:26:27,151 --> 0:26:28,92
from this experience
as a whole.


632
0:26:28,92 --> 0:26:31,222
KEVIN: Yeah, it was definitely
a learning experience,


633
0:26:31,222 --> 0:26:33,658
and it was great practice,
a good trial run.


634
0:26:33,658 --> 0:26:36,427
And I think we all have
a lot of takeaways


635
0:26:36,427 --> 0:26:40,732
that we're gonna learn from,
you know, moving forward.


636
0:26:40,732 --> 0:26:41,966
NARRATOR:
Even though Practical Preppers


637
0:26:41,966 --> 0:26:43,902
succeeded in taking the Alamo,


638
0:26:43,902 --> 0:26:46,4
for standing his ground
during the confusion


639
0:26:46,4 --> 0:26:47,538
and protecting the truck,


640
0:26:47,538 --> 0:26:49,941
Kevin earns
the ultimate accolade:


641
0:26:49,941 --> 0:26:53,11
acceptance from Lucas'
Seven Trumpet Preppers.


642
0:26:53,11 --> 0:26:55,513
LUCAS: I feel like the moment
that you pulled up,


643
0:26:55,513 --> 0:26:57,482
and we done,
we done a good shift.


644
0:26:57,482 --> 0:27:0,585
I think as a whole, all of us
think that you made the cut.


645
0:27:0,585 --> 0:27:2,187
Appreciate you.
KEVIN: All right. Thank you.


646
0:27:2,187 --> 0:27:4,355
Glad to be in.


647
0:27:4,355 --> 0:27:5,49
NARRATOR: For Kevin,


648
0:27:5,49 --> 0:27:8,426
finding acceptance
in a prepper community


649
0:27:8,426 --> 0:27:10,327
has helped his family
begin to feel


650
0:27:10,327 --> 0:27:13,131
like bugging out to Tennessee
was the right move.


651
0:27:13,131 --> 0:27:14,832
KEVIN: I really feel
we're in the right place


652
0:27:14,832 --> 0:27:16,34
because we're finding out


653
0:27:16,34 --> 0:27:17,902
there's a whole lot
of preppers up here.


654
0:27:17,902 --> 0:27:20,37
And we're finding
more and more every day,


655
0:27:20,37 --> 0:27:23,808
so starting to network together
and kind of help each other out.


656
0:27:23,808 --> 0:27:27,579
AMIE: All right, Hailey,
get your little chick.


657
0:27:27,579 --> 0:27:28,88
HAILEY: Here he is.


658
0:27:28,88 --> 0:27:30,881
AMIE: Yeah.
And what's your chicken's name?


659
0:27:30,881 --> 0:27:32,483
HAILEY: Nugget.


660
0:27:32,483 --> 0:27:34,752
HAILEY: I do believe they're
doing it because they love us.


661
0:27:34,752 --> 0:27:36,888
You know, they're our parents,
they want what's best for us,


662
0:27:36,888 --> 0:27:38,823
and I am looking forward
to having a house to live in


663
0:27:38,823 --> 0:27:40,891
on our property.


664
0:27:40,891 --> 0:27:44,396
It'd be nice to actually have
somewhere to call home.


665
0:27:44,396 --> 0:27:47,98
AMIE: Alright, that's enough.


666
0:27:47,98 --> 0:27:48,9
If the world goes to hell,


667
0:27:48,9 --> 0:27:51,435
they will absolutely
appreciate our prepping.


668
0:27:51,435 --> 0:27:53,938
If not, I don't know.


669
0:27:53,938 --> 0:27:56,408
Maybe they'll look back and say,


670
0:27:56,408 --> 0:27:58,109
"Well, you know,
they were crazy,


671
0:27:58,109 --> 0:28:1,212
but they were just doing it
so that we would be safe."


672
0:28:1,212 --> 0:28:3,18
I don't know.


673
0:28:3,18 --> 0:28:5,683
You never know.


674
0:28:5,683 --> 0:28:12,423
Hopefully they will.


675
0:28:12,423 --> 0:28:13,791
NARRATOR: Kevin and Lucas,


676
0:28:13,791 --> 0:28:15,76
the experts
at Practical Preppers,


677
0:28:15,76 --> 0:28:17,828
have reviewed your preps.


678
0:28:17,828 --> 0:28:20,765
Kevin, the fact that you are
starting to raise chickens


679
0:28:20,765 --> 0:28:23,0
is a step towards
a re-supply plan,


680
0:28:23,0 --> 0:28:25,536
but to ensure your family's
survival long-term,


681
0:28:25,536 --> 0:28:27,705
you should also plant
a vegetable garden.


682
0:28:27,705 --> 0:28:29,14
KEVIN: Once we got out there,


683
0:28:29,14 --> 0:28:32,61
one of the first things we were
gonna do was put a garden in.


684
0:28:32,61 --> 0:28:34,812
NARRATOR:
Lucas, your prepper network,


685
0:28:34,812 --> 0:28:37,749
food preservation methods,
and power sources


686
0:28:37,749 --> 0:28:39,383
are all impressive.


687
0:28:39,383 --> 0:28:42,486
But your communications plan
is completely inadequate.


688
0:28:42,486 --> 0:28:45,423
You should invest in radios
for all your team members.


689
0:28:45,423 --> 0:28:47,492
LUCAS: I believe that is
a very fair assessment,


690
0:28:47,492 --> 0:28:48,559
and that is something
that we are making


691
0:28:48,559 --> 0:28:50,395
a number-one priority right now


692
0:28:50,395 --> 0:28:54,198
and will be investing in
in the very near future.


693
0:28:54,198 --> 0:28:55,666
NARRATOR: To determine how long


694
0:28:55,666 --> 0:28:57,836
you could initially
survive a catastrophe,


695
0:28:57,836 --> 0:29:0,104
Practical Preppers
has scored your preps


696
0:29:0,104 --> 0:29:3,474
in five categories
of 20 points each.


697
0:29:3,474 --> 0:29:5,844
Kevin, cultivating food
on your property


698
0:29:5,844 --> 0:29:8,179
will greatly enhance
your re-supply plan.


699
0:29:8,179 --> 0:29:9,881
15 out of 20 points.


700
0:29:9,881 --> 0:29:13,84
Lucas, your food re-supply plan
is excellent.


701
0:29:13,84 --> 0:29:14,852
19 points.


702
0:29:14,852 --> 0:29:15,753
Water:


703
0:29:15,753 --> 0:29:17,21
Kevin, 12 points;


704
0:29:17,21 --> 0:29:18,923
Lucas, 13.


705
0:29:18,923 --> 0:29:20,158
Shelter:


706
0:29:20,158 --> 0:29:22,626
Kevin, you need to
transition from a tent


707
0:29:22,626 --> 0:29:24,662
to a more permanent
bug-out structure.


708
0:29:24,662 --> 0:29:26,64
11 points.


709
0:29:26,64 --> 0:29:28,599
Lucas, you should have
a bug-out location


710
0:29:28,599 --> 0:29:30,768
in case your compound
gets overrun.


711
0:29:30,768 --> 0:29:32,47
13 points.


712
0:29:32,47 --> 0:29:33,27
Security:


713
0:29:33,27 --> 0:29:35,206
Kevin, 13 points;


714
0:29:35,206 --> 0:29:37,541
Lucas, 16.


715
0:29:37,541 --> 0:29:39,343
Kevin, reaching out to Lucas


716
0:29:39,343 --> 0:29:41,746
shows that you recognize
the importance of community


717
0:29:41,746 --> 0:29:43,58
in surviving a disaster.


718
0:29:43,58 --> 0:29:46,551
This gives you
11 X-factor points.


719
0:29:46,551 --> 0:29:50,455
Lucas, your ability to stretch
your food supply through farming


720
0:29:50,455 --> 0:29:52,22
gives you 13.


721
0:29:52,22 --> 0:29:55,86
Kevin, your total score
is 62 out of 100.


722
0:29:55,86 --> 0:29:59,23
Lucas, your total score is 74.


723
0:29:59,23 --> 0:30:2,333
Your initial survival time
is 14 months.


724
0:30:2,333 --> 0:30:5,936
Kevin, you have 9 months
initial survival time.


725
0:30:5,936 --> 0:30:8,239
KEVIN:
Oh, harsh. 62 out of 100.


726
0:30:8,239 --> 0:30:10,941
I know we do have
some weak areas.


727
0:30:10,941 --> 0:30:13,911
Obviously building our house
and getting out on the property


728
0:30:13,911 --> 0:30:17,315
and getting everything
we have planned underway


729
0:30:17,315 --> 0:30:20,518
is gonna hugely impact,
you know, our score


730
0:30:20,518 --> 0:30:22,42
and knock it up several notches.


731
0:30:22,42 --> 0:30:24,388
LUCAS: Our water
and communication issues


732
0:30:24,388 --> 0:30:26,624
will be resolved shortly.


733
0:30:26,624 --> 0:30:28,59
As far as a bunker goes,


734
0:30:28,59 --> 0:30:32,263
we don't need one because
we meet our enemies head on.


735
0:30:32,263 --> 0:30:33,497
KEVIN: We've been real busy


736
0:30:33,497 --> 0:30:35,333
since the film crew
last came out.


737
0:30:35,333 --> 0:30:38,102
We've moved to a bit
of a prepper's paradise


738
0:30:38,102 --> 0:30:40,905
only about five miles away
from our bug-out location.


739
0:30:40,905 --> 0:30:43,74
It's got a pond out front
stocked with fish.


740
0:30:43,74 --> 0:30:44,708
It's got a wood-burning stove.


741
0:30:44,708 --> 0:30:46,444
We're always adding
to our food preps.


742
0:30:46,444 --> 0:30:48,245
We just extended
our chicken coop.


743
0:30:48,245 --> 0:30:49,68
So, keeping busy as always.


744
0:30:49,68 --> 0:30:52,583
Take care.


745
0:30:52,583 --> 0:30:54,84
LUCAS: We took care
of some of our issues


746
0:30:54,84 --> 0:30:55,82
that we had with our preps.


747
0:30:55,82 --> 0:30:57,21
As far as communication goes,


748
0:30:57,21 --> 0:30:58,823
we've gotten
some walkie-talkies.


749
0:30:58,823 --> 0:31:1,592
We've also began construction
on a hand pump for our well


750
0:31:1,592 --> 0:31:7,365
so that our water situation
will be better in control.


751
0:31:7,365 --> 0:31:9,33
NARRATOR:
The Earth's magnetic poles


752
0:31:9,33 --> 0:31:11,469
have been known
to switch places.


753
0:31:11,469 --> 0:31:15,64
The last switch happened
roughly 780,000 years ago.


754
0:31:15,64 --> 0:31:18,643
But there's no evidence
a magnetic pole reversal


755
0:31:18,643 --> 0:31:21,345
has any impact
on the Earth's geography.


756
0:31:21,345 --> 0:31:23,581
Earthquakes
on the New Madrid fault


757
0:31:23,581 --> 0:31:26,817
occur once every 500 years
on average.


758
0:31:26,817 --> 0:31:29,987
Scientists believe there's
a greater than 1 in 50 chance


759
0:31:29,987 --> 0:31:31,455
that the New Madrid fault


760
0:31:31,455 --> 0:31:37,594
will unleash a major earthquake
in the next 50 years.


761
0:31:37,594 --> 0:31:40,33
Native American prepper
Snake Blocker


762
0:31:40,33 --> 0:31:45,103
plans to survive doomsday
by becoming one with the land.


763
0:31:45,103 --> 0:31:47,104
No storage space full of food,


764
0:31:47,104 --> 0:31:49,374
no backup water supply.


765
0:31:49,374 --> 0:31:51,775
But when he tries
to teach his new wife


766
0:31:51,775 --> 0:31:53,878
the Apache way of prepping,


767
0:31:53,878 --> 0:31:56,547
it may spell trouble
for the newlyweds.


768
0:31:56,547 --> 0:31:57,648
SNAKE BLOCKER:
Do you actually see


769
0:31:57,648 --> 0:31:59,316
the baby wasp right in here?


770
0:31:59,316 --> 0:32:0,751
SNAKE BLOCKER:
You want to try it?


771
0:32:0,751 --> 0:32:6,957
MELISSA: Not right now.


772
0:32:6,957 --> 0:32:20,238
[tribal singing]


773
0:32:20,238 --> 0:32:23,407
NARRATOR: In the mountains
outside Denver, Colorado,


774
0:32:23,407 --> 0:32:25,777
Apache Native American,
Snake Blocker,


775
0:32:25,777 --> 0:32:27,645
regularly honors his heritage


776
0:32:27,645 --> 0:32:30,882
by taking part
in traditional ceremonies.


777
0:32:30,882 --> 0:32:33,45
SNAKE BLOCKER: Dancers ready?


778
0:32:33,45 --> 0:32:36,653
NARRATOR: Today, he's attending
a blessing and cleansing ritual,


779
0:32:36,653 --> 0:32:39,657
a symbolic circle of balance,
strength, and unity


780
0:32:39,657 --> 0:32:42,359
in which all are equal.


781
0:32:42,359 --> 0:32:45,229
Emulating
his ancestors' way of living


782
0:32:45,229 --> 0:32:48,65
is central
to Snake Blocker's life,


783
0:32:48,65 --> 0:32:49,934
as is upholding
their traditions,


784
0:32:49,934 --> 0:32:53,971
like interpreting
Apache prophecies.


785
0:32:53,971 --> 0:32:55,839
Over the past 15 years,


786
0:32:55,839 --> 0:32:59,21
Snake Blocker has had
a profound recurring vision,


787
0:32:59,21 --> 0:33:1,745
which he believes
is a warning from God.


788
0:33:1,745 --> 0:33:4,715
SNAKE BLOCKER: I found myself
kind of in a distant land.


789
0:33:4,715 --> 0:33:9,253
Death was showing me
that this was his plan...


790
0:33:9,253 --> 0:33:12,556
And his destruction
for the world.


791
0:33:12,556 --> 0:33:15,92
The U.S. economy will collapse.


792
0:33:15,92 --> 0:33:17,361
Look at how much debt we're in,
trillions of dollars.


793
0:33:17,361 --> 0:33:19,964
The value of the dollar
is decreasing day to day.


794
0:33:19,964 --> 0:33:22,366
Paper money
is going to be worthless.


795
0:33:22,366 --> 0:33:25,536
People are going to go to
stealing, pillaging, rioting.


796
0:33:25,536 --> 0:33:27,204
You're gonna see
the United States


797
0:33:27,204 --> 0:33:30,641
go from middle-class
society to slums.


798
0:33:30,641 --> 0:33:32,844
Nobody knows
the time or the day,


799
0:33:32,844 --> 0:33:36,48
but it's guaranteed to happen.


800
0:33:36,48 --> 0:33:37,682
Aaaah!


801
0:33:37,682 --> 0:33:42,42
I'm preparing
for economic collapse.


802
0:33:42,42 --> 0:33:44,922
It's real important for me
to utilize my wisdom


803
0:33:44,922 --> 0:33:46,857
that I've gained
from the Apache heritage


804
0:33:46,857 --> 0:33:48,358
and the Apache traditions


805
0:33:48,358 --> 0:33:51,162
and applying it
to today's situation.


806
0:33:51,162 --> 0:33:53,731
NARRATOR:
But Snake's new wife, Melissa,


807
0:33:53,731 --> 0:33:55,899
a school teacher
and trained opera singer,


808
0:33:55,899 --> 0:33:59,97
has not yet fully embraced her
husband's prepping lifestyle.


809
0:33:59,97 --> 0:34:1,906
SNAKE BLOCKER: If I was single,
it doesn't really matter.


810
0:34:1,906 --> 0:34:3,341
I'll adapt and survive.


811
0:34:3,341 --> 0:34:8,111
But my greatest fear is being
separated from Melissa, my wife.


812
0:34:8,111 --> 0:34:11,448
NARRATOR: So today,
he's decided it's finally time


813
0:34:11,448 --> 0:34:14,251
for Melissa to get on board


814
0:34:14,251 --> 0:34:17,555
and experience
what he has planned


815
0:34:17,555 --> 0:34:23,861
for life after doomsday.


816
0:34:23,861 --> 0:34:25,829
MELISSA BLOCKER: He is so...


817
0:34:25,829 --> 0:34:27,498
so very prepared
with everything, you know.


818
0:34:27,498 --> 0:34:30,901
And change for me is usually
a little bit slower.


819
0:34:30,901 --> 0:34:33,103
SNAKE BLOCKER: I need to be a
responsible husband to my wife.


820
0:34:33,103 --> 0:34:35,606
To have the strength
and the symbol of the snake,


821
0:34:35,606 --> 0:34:41,545
I too must be strong
for others around me.


822
0:34:41,545 --> 0:34:43,648
NARRATOR: Unlike many preppers,


823
0:34:43,648 --> 0:34:46,717
Snake Blocker hasn't been
stockpiling food and water


824
0:34:46,717 --> 0:34:48,486
at some remote safe house.


825
0:34:48,486 --> 0:34:51,188
There's no trailer full of food
waiting for them,


826
0:34:51,188 --> 0:34:54,125
no barrels full of water.


827
0:34:54,125 --> 0:34:57,228
Instead, he intends
for them to travel light


828
0:34:57,228 --> 0:35:2,266
and live off the land, like
his nomadic Apache ancestors.


829
0:35:2,266 --> 0:35:4,635
SNAKE BLOCKER: The Apache
is always on the move,


830
0:35:4,635 --> 0:35:8,372
so they learned to adapt
in a variety of terrains.


831
0:35:8,372 --> 0:35:11,575
The great spot is to get
to higher elevations.


832
0:35:11,575 --> 0:35:13,877
Number one,
you're away from the city.


833
0:35:13,877 --> 0:35:16,179
Number two, the higher upstream
you go up in the mountains,


834
0:35:16,179 --> 0:35:18,782
the more pure
that water is gonna be.


835
0:35:18,782 --> 0:35:21,318
NARRATOR: Because he plans to
keep them always on the move,


836
0:35:21,318 --> 0:35:24,822
they'll need to be able to drink
water wherever they can find it.


837
0:35:24,822 --> 0:35:26,957
SNAKE BLOCKER: Thirsty, hon?


838
0:35:26,957 --> 0:35:29,593
NARRATOR: But bacteria
thrive in water.


839
0:35:29,593 --> 0:35:31,94
And waterborne diseases


840
0:35:31,94 --> 0:35:34,665
kill close to 3.5 million
people each year--


841
0:35:34,665 --> 0:35:38,703
the equivalent of almost
the entire city of Los Angeles.


842
0:35:38,703 --> 0:35:39,903
SNAKE BLOCKER: Use this straw,


843
0:35:39,903 --> 0:35:41,38
get a little sip of water
and hydrate.


844
0:35:41,38 --> 0:35:42,473
NARRATOR:
So Snake Blocker considers


845
0:35:42,473 --> 0:35:47,77
their water filtration straws
invaluable.


846
0:35:47,77 --> 0:35:48,679
When water passes through them,


847
0:35:48,679 --> 0:35:51,81
activated carbon
blocks parasites


848
0:35:51,81 --> 0:35:55,52
like Salmonella and E. coli.


849
0:35:55,52 --> 0:35:57,221
SNAKE BLOCKER:
Give it a try, Melissa.


850
0:35:57,221 --> 0:35:58,989
Got to stay well-hydrated.


851
0:35:58,989 --> 0:36:3,193
Filtration straws will keep us
going for a while.


852
0:36:3,193 --> 0:36:5,563
NARRATOR: Convincing Melissa
to drink from a muddy puddle


853
0:36:5,563 --> 0:36:6,997
is one thing;


854
0:36:6,997 --> 0:36:9,9
getting her accustomed to eating
what he can find in the hills


855
0:36:9,9 --> 0:36:11,368
is another.


856
0:36:11,368 --> 0:36:13,237
SNAKE BLOCKER:
You want to basically


857
0:36:13,237 --> 0:36:14,438
be able to survive on your own


858
0:36:14,438 --> 0:36:17,241
through the means
of hunting, fishing.


859
0:36:17,241 --> 0:36:20,244
NARRATOR: But in the wilderness,
Snake Blocker's experience


860
0:36:20,244 --> 0:36:22,179
is that it can take
up to three days


861
0:36:22,179 --> 0:36:24,281
to find any animals for food.


862
0:36:24,281 --> 0:36:26,15
So he wants to train Melissa


863
0:36:26,15 --> 0:36:28,285
to be willing to take
what they can get


864
0:36:28,285 --> 0:36:30,654
when resources are scarce.


865
0:36:30,654 --> 0:36:31,889
SNAKE BLOCKER:
You're trying to hunt,


866
0:36:31,889 --> 0:36:33,824
but you're unsuccessful
for up to three days.


867
0:36:33,824 --> 0:36:36,126
Then you find food, you've got
a little bit of nutrients,


868
0:36:36,126 --> 0:36:37,861
and then it might be another
three days without food,


869
0:36:37,861 --> 0:36:39,463
and that tends
to be the pattern.


870
0:36:39,463 --> 0:36:41,465
In the meantime,
you can rely on insects,


871
0:36:41,465 --> 0:36:43,367
and that will help your body
and sustain your muscles


872
0:36:43,367 --> 0:36:45,469
to help you continue the hunt.


873
0:36:45,469 --> 0:36:49,306
Look, Melissa, over here.
We got an anthill.


874
0:36:49,306 --> 0:36:51,475
It's kind of nice, actually.


875
0:36:51,475 --> 0:36:56,881
Just using my hands, if I didn't
have a shovel or anything.


876
0:36:56,881 --> 0:36:59,49
All you got to do
is put your hand out,


877
0:36:59,49 --> 0:37:1,84
and the food comes to you.


878
0:37:1,84 --> 0:37:3,954
NARRATOR:
There are roughly 1,700 species


879
0:37:3,954 --> 0:37:6,323
of insects in the world
that are edible


880
0:37:6,323 --> 0:37:9,726
and which can provide calories,
protein, and vitamins.


881
0:37:9,726 --> 0:37:13,864
Ants, in particular, can be
high in protein and low in fat.


882
0:37:13,864 --> 0:37:16,367
SNAKE BLOCKER: So take it,
you smash them.


883
0:37:16,367 --> 0:37:21,205
That way they don't bite
your tongue when you do it.


884
0:37:21,205 --> 0:37:22,806
You want to
crunch them right away,


885
0:37:22,806 --> 0:37:24,875
just in case
they still are alive


886
0:37:24,875 --> 0:37:26,61
and they will pinch your tongue.


887
0:37:26,61 --> 0:37:27,811
I swallow it.


888
0:37:27,811 --> 0:37:29,313
MELISSA: What do they
taste like, hon?


889
0:37:29,313 --> 0:37:30,647
SNAKE BLOCKER:
There's a tiny bit of juice


890
0:37:30,647 --> 0:37:32,82
that comes out
from their guts


891
0:37:32,82 --> 0:37:35,86
and really doesn't have
a whole lot of taste to it.


892
0:37:35,86 --> 0:37:37,421
MELISSA:
That would gross me out.


893
0:37:37,421 --> 0:37:39,623
SNAKE BLOCKER:
You want to try one, Melissa?


894
0:37:39,623 --> 0:37:44,261
MELISSA:
No, I really don't want to.


895
0:37:44,261 --> 0:37:47,231
SNAKE BLOCKER: I always like
to lean over boards like these


896
0:37:47,231 --> 0:37:49,232
'cause you never know what
you're going to see under there.


897
0:37:49,232 --> 0:37:50,767
I've caught
some snakes, lizards,


898
0:37:50,767 --> 0:37:53,503
all kinds of insects under here.


899
0:37:53,503 --> 0:37:54,505
Nice.


900
0:37:54,505 --> 0:37:55,906
MELISSA: Ooh.


901
0:37:55,906 --> 0:37:57,674
SNAKE BLOCKER:
So that's the first time


902
0:37:57,674 --> 0:38:0,61
I've seen a wasp's nest
under a log.


903
0:38:0,61 --> 0:38:6,283
We'll see if we can kill them
and eat their young.


904
0:38:6,283 --> 0:38:9,687
You actually see the baby wasp
right in here.


905
0:38:9,687 --> 0:38:10,72
MELISSA: Okay.


906
0:38:10,72 --> 0:38:11,689
SNAKE BLOCKER:
You want to try it?


907
0:38:11,689 --> 0:38:13,557
MELISSA: Not right now.


908
0:38:13,557 --> 0:38:17,27
SNAKE BLOCKER:
All right. I'll try it.


909
0:38:17,27 --> 0:38:18,929
It's not going to bother me.
I'm not going to vomit.


910
0:38:18,929 --> 0:38:20,163
A little more
nutrients in there.


911
0:38:20,163 --> 0:38:22,733
You can actually
boil this entire hive here


912
0:38:22,733 --> 0:38:25,335
and eat the entire thing
just like that.


913
0:38:25,335 --> 0:38:27,337
You do what you need to do.


914
0:38:27,337 --> 0:38:30,41
NARRATOR: Because of Melissa's
reluctance to eat insects,


915
0:38:30,41 --> 0:38:31,475
if Snake Blocker expects them


916
0:38:31,475 --> 0:38:34,111
to be able to survive
a potential doomsday


917
0:38:34,111 --> 0:38:35,646
by living off the land,


918
0:38:35,646 --> 0:38:38,582
he's going to have to find
more palatable food sources


919
0:38:38,582 --> 0:38:39,75
for his wife.


920
0:38:39,75 --> 0:38:41,185
MELISSA: Getting hungry.


921
0:38:41,185 --> 0:38:44,488
NARRATOR: But in the mountains
of Colorado, keeping Melissa fed


922
0:38:44,488 --> 0:38:53,831
is going to put all his Apache
hunting skills to the test.


923
0:38:53,831 --> 0:38:55,966
NARRATOR: Denver prepper,
Snake Blocker,


924
0:38:55,966 --> 0:38:57,635
is training his newlywed wife


925
0:38:57,635 --> 0:39:0,771
how to survive life
after an economic collapse


926
0:39:0,771 --> 0:39:2,673
by taking her from
their comfortable home


927
0:39:2,673 --> 0:39:7,477
and out into the wild.


928
0:39:7,477 --> 0:39:9,646
Unlike other preppers


929
0:39:9,646 --> 0:39:12,682
who might spend thousands
of dollars stockpiling food,


930
0:39:12,682 --> 0:39:15,552
Snake Blocker believes
their key to survival


931
0:39:15,552 --> 0:39:17,788
is by following
his Apache heritage


932
0:39:17,788 --> 0:39:20,9
and living off the land.


933
0:39:20,9 --> 0:39:22,25
SNAKE BLOCKER: It doesn't matter
what tribe you're from.


934
0:39:22,25 --> 0:39:26,23
Our ancestors
always told us be prepared.


935
0:39:26,23 --> 0:39:28,198
They would train without fear,


936
0:39:28,198 --> 0:39:29,9
and they would train
to never give up.


937
0:39:29,9 --> 0:39:31,668
NARRATOR: When trying to survive


938
0:39:31,668 --> 0:39:34,705
off only what he can hunt
in the mountains of Colorado,


939
0:39:34,705 --> 0:39:38,976
Snake Blocker knows one can
go days without a kill.


940
0:39:38,976 --> 0:39:40,41
But his new wife, Melissa,


941
0:39:40,41 --> 0:39:43,314
isn't used to being
without food for that long.


942
0:39:43,314 --> 0:39:47,984
MELISSA: Getting hungry.


943
0:39:47,984 --> 0:39:52,489
NARRATOR: So Snake is focusing
all his Apache hunting skills


944
0:39:52,489 --> 0:39:55,526
toward trying to find
their dinner.


945
0:39:55,526 --> 0:39:56,46
SNAKE BLOCKER:
To use a bow and arrow


946
0:39:56,46 --> 0:39:59,196
takes a high level of skill.


947
0:39:59,196 --> 0:40:3,66
Cool, got a rabbit.


948
0:40:3,66 --> 0:40:5,235
It's a fat little guy.


949
0:40:5,235 --> 0:40:9,39
NARRATOR: A hare's lifespan
is between one and five years,


950
0:40:9,39 --> 0:40:11,475
but they can have litters
of five kids at a time,


951
0:40:11,475 --> 0:40:13,41
making them
a more abundant food source


952
0:40:13,41 --> 0:40:15,612
than large game.


953
0:40:15,612 --> 0:40:17,114
SNAKE BLOCKER:
We've got dinner.


954
0:40:17,114 --> 0:40:18,816
MELISSA: Yay!


955
0:40:18,816 --> 0:40:19,883
NARRATOR:
Because they've bugged-out


956
0:40:19,883 --> 0:40:21,585
with precious few supplies,


957
0:40:21,585 --> 0:40:23,53
Snake's survival plan


958
0:40:23,53 --> 0:40:25,655
depends on being able
to find what they need


959
0:40:25,655 --> 0:40:27,457
in the environment around them.


960
0:40:27,457 --> 0:40:30,394
And that includes
shelter from the elements.


961
0:40:30,394 --> 0:40:33,43
SNAKE BLOCKER: This is like
a native ceremonial area.


962
0:40:33,43 --> 0:40:36,6
It may be used periodically,
but for now it's not being used,


963
0:40:36,6 --> 0:40:38,702
and we have
quite a few resources we can use


964
0:40:38,702 --> 0:40:40,704
to build a shelter.


965
0:40:40,704 --> 0:40:43,7
NARRATOR: Snake also finds
an animal's jaw bone,


966
0:40:43,7 --> 0:40:47,11
which he turns into a tool
for skinning their kill.


967
0:40:47,11 --> 0:40:52,95
MELISSA: I'm not used to seeing
a rabbit being skinned.


968
0:40:52,95 --> 0:40:55,319
SNAKE BLOCKER: A little
more scraping here,


969
0:40:55,319 --> 0:40:57,21
make sure it's nice and clean.


970
0:40:57,21 --> 0:40:59,856
In a survival situation,


971
0:40:59,856 --> 0:41:9,433
you got to do things
safe and quick.


972
0:41:9,433 --> 0:41:11,768
NARRATOR: Snake Blocker
now needs to rely


973
0:41:11,768 --> 0:41:14,4
on another Apache skill
he was taught


974
0:41:14,4 --> 0:41:17,774
to ensure they can cook
the day's catch.


975
0:41:17,774 --> 0:41:19,75
SNAKE BLOCKER: What I'll do


976
0:41:19,75 --> 0:41:21,144
is I can take a branch
that's slightly bowed,


977
0:41:21,144 --> 0:41:23,346
I can take strings,
tie it up to each end


978
0:41:23,346 --> 0:41:24,915
so it looks like a mini bow.


979
0:41:24,915 --> 0:41:26,417
NARRATOR: A bow drill,


980
0:41:26,417 --> 0:41:29,252
one of the most ancient
fire-starting techniques,


981
0:41:29,252 --> 0:41:31,889
works well in most environments.


982
0:41:31,889 --> 0:41:33,257
SNAKE BLOCKER: Kind of almost
like playing a violin


983
0:41:33,257 --> 0:41:34,558
where you're just going
to saw it back and forth


984
0:41:34,558 --> 0:41:36,159
and back and forth.


985
0:41:36,159 --> 0:41:39,62
NARRATOR: Friction heats
the wood dust to 800 degrees,


986
0:41:39,62 --> 0:41:41,97
producing a smoldering coal.


987
0:41:41,97 --> 0:41:48,739
SNAKE BLOCKER: I can do
the kindling here.


988
0:41:48,739 --> 0:41:51,41
Alright.
You getting hungry, babe?


989
0:41:51,41 --> 0:41:59,516
MELISSA: Yeah.


990
0:41:59,516 --> 0:42:2,886
SNAKE BLOCKER: God creator
and rabbit spirit,


991
0:42:2,886 --> 0:42:5,456
thank you for blessing us
with your meat.


992
0:42:5,456 --> 0:42:13,564
All right, dig in, babe.


993
0:42:13,564 --> 0:42:15,599
MELISSA: It's pretty good.


994
0:42:15,599 --> 0:42:17,934
A lot better than the ants.


995
0:42:17,934 --> 0:42:19,736
SNAKE BLOCKER: You actually
want to eat the eyeball.


996
0:42:19,736 --> 0:42:23,64
Push it...you're able
to pop it out.


997
0:42:23,64 --> 0:42:26,41
Actually it comes out
fairly clean.


998
0:42:26,41 --> 0:42:28,378
The connective tissue
already burnt off.


999
0:42:28,378 --> 0:42:32,516
The good's in here.


1000
0:42:32,516 --> 0:42:35,919
MELISSA: You can have
the other one, too.


1001
0:42:35,919 --> 0:42:37,587
SNAKE BLOCKER: Next time
you're trying one.


1002
0:42:37,587 --> 0:42:39,69
MELISSA: All right.
It's a deal.


1003
0:42:39,69 --> 0:42:42,258
SNAKE BLOCKER: She's seen the
importance of these skill sets,


1004
0:42:42,258 --> 0:42:44,26
she's appreciating it,
and she's accepted it,


1005
0:42:44,26 --> 0:42:45,863
which is great.


1006
0:42:45,863 --> 0:42:48,432
I always called him paranoid,


1007
0:42:48,432 --> 0:42:50,133
but I just realized,
you know,


1008
0:42:50,133 --> 0:42:52,269
the importance
of being prepared.


1009
0:42:52,269 --> 0:42:54,638
It brings a new priority to it,


1010
0:42:54,638 --> 0:42:56,406
just to make sure I'm prepared


1011
0:42:56,406 --> 0:42:59,109
to be able to do
what needs to be done.


1012
0:42:59,109 --> 0:43:0,577
SNAKE BLOCKER: People rely
too much on the government


1013
0:43:0,577 --> 0:43:2,446
to protect them,
especially in the U.S.


1014
0:43:2,446 --> 0:43:4,247
The people that
are gonna survive


1015
0:43:4,247 --> 0:43:6,984
are gonna be the people
who have alternative methods


1016
0:43:6,984 --> 0:43:12,156
of supporting themselves.


1017
0:43:12,156 --> 0:43:13,523
NARRATOR: Snake Blocker,


1018
0:43:13,523 --> 0:43:16,827
Practical Preppers
has assessed your preps.


1019
0:43:16,827 --> 0:43:19,29
Your nomadic bug-out strategy
will ensure


1020
0:43:19,29 --> 0:43:22,132
that you will always be able
to find food and water.


1021
0:43:22,132 --> 0:43:24,134
However, your straw filters


1022
0:43:24,134 --> 0:43:26,803
are only designed
to filter 20 gallons.


1023
0:43:26,803 --> 0:43:29,54
SNAKE BLOCKER: I do have
several water filtration straws.


1024
0:43:29,54 --> 0:43:33,43
We can filter up to about
500 gallons worth of water


1025
0:43:33,43 --> 0:43:35,879
directly from the streams
or ponds, or even toilets.


1026
0:43:35,879 --> 0:43:39,82
NARRATOR: Also, hunting is
incredibly time-consuming.


1027
0:43:39,82 --> 0:43:41,418
We recommend setting
snares or traps


1028
0:43:41,418 --> 0:43:44,888
to augment your food supply.


1029
0:43:44,888 --> 0:43:47,858
Practical Preppers
has scored your preps


1030
0:43:47,858 --> 0:43:50,727
in five categories
of 20 points each.


1031
0:43:50,727 --> 0:43:51,895
Food:


1032
0:43:51,895 --> 0:43:53,663
if you don't bring
supplies with you,


1033
0:43:53,663 --> 0:43:56,266
you will be limited to what
you can hunt and harvest.


1034
0:43:56,266 --> 0:43:58,502
6 out of 20 points.


1035
0:43:58,502 --> 0:44:1,271
Water: 9 out of 20 points.


1036
0:44:1,271 --> 0:44:4,608
Shelter: 8 out of 20 points.


1037
0:44:4,608 --> 0:44:7,777
Security: 15 out of 20 points.


1038
0:44:7,777 --> 0:44:11,181
Your knife skills will help you
survive with limited resources.


1039
0:44:11,181 --> 0:44:14,485
For this, you receive
10 X-factor points.


1040
0:44:14,485 --> 0:44:17,52
Your total score
is 48 out of 100.


1041
0:44:17,52 --> 0:44:20,19
You have four months'
initial survival time.


1042
0:44:20,19 --> 0:44:21,825
SNAKE BLOCKER:
Well, based on that evaluation,


1043
0:44:21,825 --> 0:44:23,327
I disagree with it.


1044
0:44:23,327 --> 0:44:25,662
I'll be able to survive as long
as needed, as long as I live.


1045
0:44:25,662 --> 0:44:28,665
The score should be much higher.


1046
0:44:28,665 --> 0:44:31,601
Having a secondary bug-out
location in the mountains


1047
0:44:31,601 --> 0:44:32,936
is ideal.


1048
0:44:32,936 --> 0:44:34,471
Melissa and I
have been expanding


1049
0:44:34,471 --> 0:44:37,207
our secondary bug-out location
at her parents' house.


1050
0:44:37,207 --> 0:44:40,377
Here we have a natural spring
that bubbles out of the ground,


1051
0:44:40,377 --> 0:44:43,313
extra portable
water storage containers,


1052
0:44:43,313 --> 0:44:45,48
set up the spigots on them


1053
0:44:45,48 --> 0:44:47,484
so we can actually get
a good amount of water supply.


1054
0:44:47,484 --> 0:44:48,785
We added hens and chickens.


1055
0:44:48,785 --> 0:44:50,821
That way we're able
to get supplies


1056
0:44:50,821 --> 0:44:55,558
for both the meat
and for the eggs.


1057
0:44:55,558 --> 0:44:57,661
NARRATOR:
In spite of the recent recession


1058
0:44:57,661 --> 0:44:59,329
and European debt crisis,


1059
0:44:59,329 --> 0:45:1,698
most economists believe
a near-term depression


1060
0:45:1,698 --> 0:45:2,899
is unlikely,


1061
0:45:2,899 --> 0:45:4,667
and the odds
of a global collapse


1062
0:45:4,667 --> 0:45:7,27
that would result in
a severe breakdown of society


1063
0:45:7,27 --> 0:47:7,27
are remote.
