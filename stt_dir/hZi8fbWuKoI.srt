Our family would like to welcome you to 
our home in Genero Herrera, Peru.

4
0:0:42,83 --> 0:0:46,715
this tranquil village in the Amazon is home 
to a natural community of beautiful


5
0:0:46,715 --> 0:0:48,375
people,


6
0:0:48,375 --> 0:0:50,82
sacred medicinal plants,


7
0:0:50,82 --> 0:0:53,27
and the shamans who ritually administer them,


8
0:0:53,27 --> 0:0:58,407
including native-born Don Eloy Navarro-Java.


9
0:0:58,407 --> 0:1:1,523
With over twenty five years of experience,


10
0:1:1,523 --> 0:1:5,948
and a direct lineage to several generations of respected shamans, 


11
0:1:5,948 --> 0:1:8,57
Eloy brings powerful healing,


12
0:1:8,57 --> 0:1:9,813
wisdom,


13
0:1:9,813 --> 0:1:10,754
light,


14
0:1:10,754 --> 0:1:12,811
and love to every ceremony,


15
0:1:12,811 --> 0:1:15,616
allowing friends and community members


16
0:1:15,616 --> 0:1:20,364
to experience direct teaching from 
the Divine plant spirits themselves--


17
0:1:20,364 --> 0:1:24,893
a true gift from God.


18
0:1:24,893 --> 0:1:27,832
Shaman Eloy and I welcome you to our home


19
0:1:27,832 --> 0:1:30,443

0:1:31,558 --> 0:1:34,385
and Jheffri,


22
0:1:34,385 --> 0:1:36,612
as well as various other apprentices and guests.


23
0:1:36,612 --> 0:1:38,878
Besides being a loving partner in the medicine,


24
0:1:38,878 --> 0:1:41,935
my role is to serve as a bridge


25
0:1:41,935 --> 0:1:44,526
between the Peruvian shamanic culture


26
0:1:44,526 --> 0:1:47,925
and the hearing and Deaf Western worlds, 


27
0:1:47,925 --> 0:1:49,565
interpreting Spanish,


28
0:1:49,565 --> 0:1:50,668

30
0:1:52,85 --> 0:1:54,71
 as well as apprenticing


31
0:1:54,71 --> 0:1:56,509
to one day become a shamaness myself.


32
0:1:56,509 --> 0:1:59,207
My background is in psychology 


33
0:1:59,207 --> 0:2:2,883
at Gallaudet University as a Hearing Undergraduate,


34
0:2:2,883 --> 0:2:2,883

at Shamanic Healing Institute 


38
0:2:12,965 --> 0:2:15,67
in Savage, Maryland.


39
0:2:15,67 --> 0:2:18,888
Various other apprentices and friends


40
0:2:18,888 --> 0:2:21,82
share in the medicine throughout the year,


41
0:2:21,82 --> 0:2:23,952
including Eloy's oldest son, Jolker,


42
0:2:23,952 --> 0:2:25,742

0:2:25,742 --> 0:2:27,654

44
0:2:27,654 --> 0:2:29,953
and many, many more. 


45
0:2:29,953 --> 0:2:32,974
Together, we share in the gathering,


46
0:2:32,974 --> 0:2:34,272
preperation,


47
0:2:34,272 --> 0:2:35,974
and celebration


48
0:2:35,974 --> 0:2:38,5
of the sacred Master Teacher plant,


49
0:2:38,5 --> 0:2:40,565
Ayahuasca.


50
0:2:40,565 --> 0:2:43,339
Being one of the world's sacred power centers,


51
0:2:43,339 --> 0:2:45,463
the Amazon births the combination


52
0:2:45,463 --> 0:2:46,819
of various potent,


53
0:2:46,819 --> 0:2:47,943
healing,


54
0:2:47,943 --> 0:2:50,32
sacred medicinal teaching plants,


55
0:2:50,32 --> 0:2:53,312
to create one of the most lovingly intense,


56
0:2:53,312 --> 0:2:54,655
powerful,


57
0:2:54,655 --> 0:2:57,209
life changing spiritual paths available--


58
0:2:57,209 --> 0:3:2,239
Ayahuasca Shamanism.


59
0:3:2,239 --> 0:3:5,306
The plants are gathered with love and consciousness,


60
0:3:5,306 --> 0:3:7,545
carefully cooked into a tea,


61
0:3:7,545 --> 0:3:9,62
which is taken in physically


62
0:3:9,62 --> 0:3:13,376
to commence the ancient ceremony. 


63
0:3:13,376 --> 0:3:17,36
(shaman chanting)


64
0:3:17,36 --> 0:3:20,299
As the plants of pure, Divine light


65
0:3:20,299 --> 0:3:22,423
make physical contact with the body,


66
0:3:22,423 --> 0:3:26,126
they search to purge out anything unlike themselves,


67
0:3:26,126 --> 0:3:28,971
including crossed or dark energies,


68
0:3:28,971 --> 0:3:31,24
entities and spirits,


69
0:3:31,24 --> 0:3:33,987
negative belief systems and emotions,


70
0:3:33,987 --> 0:3:36,682
as well as various physical ailments.


71
0:3:36,682 --> 0:3:39,446
These God-centered spirits


72
0:3:39,446 --> 0:3:41,398
then instill light and love,


73
0:3:41,398 --> 0:3:43,557
strength and protection,


74
0:3:43,557 --> 0:3:46,878
and profound, Divine wisdom into the person,


75
0:3:46,878 --> 0:3:50,946
who is then forever changed.


76
0:3:50,946 --> 0:3:54,345
The Third Eye is naturally open the entire time,


77
0:3:54,345 --> 0:3:57,655
so that the person can see in clear,


78
0:3:57,655 --> 0:4:0,74
physical-spiritual vision,


79
0:4:0,74 --> 0:4:3,293
exactly what is happening throughout the process.


80
0:4:3,293 --> 0:4:6,151
By the opening of the Third Eye,


81
0:4:6,151 --> 0:4:8,879
the person can improve psychic abilities,


82
0:4:8,879 --> 0:4:11,32
increase healing skills,


83
0:4:11,32 --> 0:4:14,297
and tap into wisdom that is rarely attainable


84
0:4:14,297 --> 0:4:16,138
from the physical plane.


85
0:4:16,138 --> 0:4:18,647
The energetic body is rebalanced,


86
0:4:18,647 --> 0:4:20,775
the chakras are realigned,


87
0:4:20,775 --> 0:4:23,31
and the aura comes out very strong.


88
0:4:23,31 --> 0:4:28,987
There are infinite levels to this spiritual training.


89
0:4:28,987 --> 0:4:32,646
To further strengthen the body, mind, and spirit,


90
0:4:32,646 --> 0:4:36,813
apprentices and shamans alike practice shamanic dieting,


91
0:4:36,813 --> 0:4:41,929
where 8-40 day periods are taken with limited food types,


92
0:4:41,929 --> 0:4:48,55
abstaining from salt, sugar, alcohol, and sexual activity


93
0:4:48,55 --> 0:4:52,766
in order to absorb and integrate various plant medicines


94
0:4:52,766 --> 0:4:56,735
into the body, strengthening and protecting it


95
0:4:56,735 --> 0:4:58,577
physically and spiritually,


96
0:4:58,577 --> 0:5:2,306
in order to prepare for new levels on one's path.


97
0:5:2,306 --> 0:5:4,955
Optional shamanic diets are available to


98
0:5:4,955 --> 0:5:7,829
all who feel called to participate. 


99
0:5:7,829 --> 0:5:10,122
In addition to the plant medicines,


100
0:5:10,122 --> 0:5:14,445
Don Eloy is a military trained jungle survival expert,


101
0:5:14,445 --> 0:5:16,998
and a master of plant identification,


102
0:5:16,998 --> 0:5:20,405
