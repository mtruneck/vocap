0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:38,204



2
0:0:38,204 --> 0:0:40,69
CRAIG COSTELLO: I never
studied painting.


3
0:0:40,69 --> 0:0:43,31
All my experience with
putting paint on


4
0:0:43,31 --> 0:0:45,51
something came from graffiti.


5
0:0:45,51 --> 0:0:50,38
And the kind of graffiti I did
was always really simple.


6
0:0:50,38 --> 0:0:55,61
As I started to paint in a
studio, I would paint these


7
0:0:55,61 --> 0:0:59,8
letters and straight lines
and everything.


8
0:0:59,8 --> 0:1:1,64
And I would try to make
it perfect, and it


9
0:1:1,64 --> 0:1:2,89
just drove me insane.


10
0:1:2,89 --> 0:1:8,14



11
0:1:8,14 --> 0:1:9,4
I grew up in New York.


12
0:1:9,4 --> 0:1:12,84
I'm from Queens, Forest Hills.


13
0:1:12,84 --> 0:1:21,11
And I grew up, I was a teenager
in the '80s, and I


14
0:1:21,11 --> 0:1:28,95
was into skating and everything
from hardcore to


15
0:1:28,95 --> 0:1:30,98
hip-hop, punk rock.


16
0:1:30,98 --> 0:1:33,98
I grew up in a culture of like,
you stole your paint,


17
0:1:33,98 --> 0:1:39,94
you wrote illegally, you made
your own markers, or you found


18
0:1:39,94 --> 0:1:41,52
your own caps.


19
0:1:41,52 --> 0:1:44,74
And you took care of them,
and it was all tools.


20
0:1:44,74 --> 0:1:48,5
And you had to learn
and understand


21
0:1:48,5 --> 0:1:49,53
everything on your own.


22
0:1:49,53 --> 0:1:52,6
Like this cap was good for this,
or this paint was no


23
0:1:52,6 --> 0:1:54,73
good, or whatever it was.


24
0:1:54,73 --> 0:2:4,5



25
0:2:4,5 --> 0:2:8,38
When I started just doing drips
on doors or mailboxes, I


26
0:2:8,38 --> 0:2:10,83
got a lot of positive
feedback.


27
0:2:10,83 --> 0:2:12,78
People were really interested
in it, they thought it was


28
0:2:12,78 --> 0:2:14,26
really cool.


29
0:2:14,26 --> 0:2:17,7
The fire extinguishers is
something that I didn't invent


30
0:2:17,7 --> 0:2:20,95
it, I wasn't the first one to
use it for those means.


31
0:2:20,95 --> 0:2:24,91
But it was another example of
reappropriating something to


32
0:2:24,91 --> 0:2:26,57
basically use as a tool.


33
0:2:26,57 --> 0:2:31,57
It acted very similarly to
the markers that I made.


34
0:2:31,57 --> 0:2:33,37
I moved to San Francisco.


35
0:2:33,37 --> 0:2:35,46
I went to school for
photography.


36
0:2:35,46 --> 0:2:37,87
I lived there from '92 to '98.


37
0:2:37,87 --> 0:2:41,66
I don't know, it was easier
to get materials.


38
0:2:41,66 --> 0:2:44,57
So from a graffiti sense, paint
was more accessible,


39
0:2:44,57 --> 0:2:47,16
markers were more accessible,
all kinds of things were more


40
0:2:47,16 --> 0:2:48,73
accessible to me.


41
0:2:48,73 --> 0:2:51,59
Because in New York, stuff
is so locked down.


42
0:2:51,59 --> 0:2:55,2
I probably started making
Krink around '93,


43
0:2:55,2 --> 0:2:55,7
and that was it.


44
0:2:55,7 --> 0:3:1,32
There's was no business plan,
there was no T-shirt company,


45
0:3:1,32 --> 0:3:4,59
there was no street art.


46
0:3:4,59 --> 0:3:8,84
It was just friends and
having a good time.


47
0:3:8,84 --> 0:3:13,16
I was able to have my own
aesthetic on the street and


48
0:3:13,16 --> 0:3:15,74
stand out from the rest
of the people.


49
0:3:15,74 --> 0:3:21,63
And since I had my own kind of
tool and materials, people had


50
0:3:21,63 --> 0:3:24,35
to figure that out just
to get to where I was.


51
0:3:24,35 --> 0:3:27,24
So it was just being that little
bit ahead of the curve.


52
0:3:27,24 --> 0:3:33,35



53
0:3:33,35 --> 0:3:35,36
So I moved back to New York.


54
0:3:35,36 --> 0:3:39,7
I was living in the Lower East
Side, and I met these guys who


55
0:3:39,7 --> 0:3:41,15
opened a store called ALIFE.


56
0:3:41,15 --> 0:3:43,54
They were just like, look, this
is really interesting


57
0:3:43,54 --> 0:3:44,82
what you're doing.


58
0:3:44,82 --> 0:3:46,46
We think you could sell it--


59
0:3:46,46 --> 0:3:47,49
we'll help you.


60
0:3:47,49 --> 0:3:50,2
And it became this
creative project.


61
0:3:50,2 --> 0:3:51,2
I made some Krink.


62
0:3:51,2 --> 0:3:54,55
We made a logo, we made
some labels, put some


63
0:3:54,55 --> 0:3:56,86
directions on it.


64
0:3:56,86 --> 0:4:0,9
Put it in their store and
it sold out right away.


65
0:4:0,9 --> 0:4:2,86
So they got press.


66
0:4:2,86 --> 0:4:6,48
They had Krink there, other
shops saw that and wanted it.


67
0:4:6,48 --> 0:4:8,6
And then at the same time
I would hook up


68
0:4:8,6 --> 0:4:12,9
with the Irak crew.


69
0:4:12,9 --> 0:4:15,87
They were young, I was a little
bit older at that time


70
0:4:15,87 --> 0:4:17,5
so I wasn't really going hard.


71
0:4:17,5 --> 0:4:18,839
These guys were really
going hard.


72
0:4:18,839 --> 0:4:21,97
And so I'd give them Krink,
and they would just be out


73
0:4:21,97 --> 0:4:25,53
every night writing until
all of downtown


74
0:4:25,53 --> 0:4:27,59
was basically covered.


75
0:4:27,59 --> 0:4:30,44
And that got a lot of attention
because everybody's


76
0:4:30,44 --> 0:4:31,82
like what is that?


77
0:4:31,82 --> 0:4:32,95
What is that?


78
0:4:32,95 --> 0:4:34,3
How are they doing it?


79
0:4:34,3 --> 0:4:35,55
It's Krink.


80
0:4:35,55 --> 0:4:39,1



81
0:4:39,1 --> 0:4:45,31
I run a business as one part
of something that I do.


82
0:4:45,31 --> 0:4:48,6
But I also work on art
and design projects.


83
0:4:48,6 --> 0:4:52,19
And it's really difficult
sometimes to be doing both,


84
0:4:52,19 --> 0:4:55,85
because mentally they can be
really different spaces.


85
0:4:55,85 --> 0:4:57,31
People ask the question.


86
0:4:57,31 --> 0:5:1,25
Like oh, you were in the street,
should stay in street.


87
0:5:1,25 --> 0:5:6,25
And who's to say that I'm
not allowed to evolve?


88
0:5:6,25 --> 0:5:10,93
And I really love being behind
the brand sometimes, because


89
0:5:10,93 --> 0:5:13,89
the brand is more-- it's a
brand, it's not really me.


90
0:5:13,89 --> 0:5:17,16
And I kind of like just brand
it and market it.


91
0:5:17,16 --> 0:5:24,1
With me sometimes, it's like
stuff is emotional, and I kind


92
0:5:24,1 --> 0:5:27,66
of want to have to be able
to do whatever the


93
0:5:27,66 --> 0:5:28,91
hell I want to do.


94
0:5:28,91 --> 0:5:31,61



95
0:5:31,61 --> 0:5:37,66
There's definitely been some
great opportunities for public


96
0:5:37,66 --> 0:5:40,0
art projects and travel.


97
0:5:40,0 --> 0:5:44,89
And I think that a lot of people
are beginning to try to


98
0:5:44,89 --> 0:5:47,5
organize things themselves.


99
0:5:47,5 --> 0:5:52,15
And I've definitely been
involved in things where they


100
0:5:52,15 --> 0:5:54,94
get the community involved,
the local community.


101
0:5:54,94 --> 0:5:58,45
And they get business owners
to contribute walls.


102
0:5:58,45 --> 0:6:4,9
They fly in artists from all
over to paint on walls as part


103
0:6:4,9 --> 0:6:7,2
of greater public art project.


104
0:6:7,2 --> 0:6:10,51
And it's all people who are just
really interested in art,


105
0:6:10,51 --> 0:6:13,275
but maybe it's not a formal
gallery setting.


106
0:6:13,275 --> 0:6:15,83
It's more interested
in the public


107
0:6:15,83 --> 0:6:18,936
space and youth culture.


108
0:6:18,936 --> 0:6:22,9
TIFFANY TANAKA: We are at Loft
in Space in Honolulu, Hawaii.


109
0:6:22,9 --> 0:6:24,67
I've been on Queen Street
for about the


110
0:6:24,67 --> 0:6:27,3
past eight years now.


111
0:6:27,3 --> 0:6:30,13
Slowly made my way into
this warehouse.


112
0:6:30,13 --> 0:6:33,4
We acquired the front,
we had a denim store.


113
0:6:33,4 --> 0:6:37,7
And before the denim store we
had a streetware store called


114
0:6:37,7 --> 0:6:40,23
Queens, and we carried Krink.


115
0:6:40,23 --> 0:6:43,23
So I was in contact with Krink
about five years ago.


116
0:6:43,23 --> 0:6:46,33
And when we were planning these
shows, I thought it


117
0:6:46,33 --> 0:6:49,6
would be so cool to bring him
here because he's such an


118
0:6:49,6 --> 0:6:52,45
inspiration to so many
artists out here.


119
0:6:52,45 --> 0:6:57,7
And the simplicity of what
he does is amazing.


120
0:6:57,7 --> 0:7:1,28
But he's the expert in
dripping and ink.


121
0:7:1,28 --> 0:7:4,31



122
0:7:4,31 --> 0:7:6,27
One big thing for both
of us, I think , is


123
0:7:6,27 --> 0:7:8,0
art for social change.


124
0:7:8,0 --> 0:7:12,25
And it really affects what's
going on, and especially our


125
0:7:12,25 --> 0:7:13,5
economy in Hawaii.


126
0:7:13,5 --> 0:7:16,348



127
0:7:16,348 --> 0:7:18,87
JASPER WONG: I've lived in
Portland and San Francisco and


128
0:7:18,87 --> 0:7:20,16
Japan and Hong Kong.


129
0:7:20,16 --> 0:7:21,932
And she's lived in San Francisco
and New York and


130
0:7:21,932 --> 0:7:23,25
Paris and stuff.


131
0:7:23,25 --> 0:7:25,25
And we're exposed to lots
of that kind of


132
0:7:25,25 --> 0:7:27,92
artwork and we love it.


133
0:7:27,92 --> 0:7:30,71
We wanted to bring what
we saw out there in


134
0:7:30,71 --> 0:7:32,576
those cities to Hawaii.


135
0:7:32,576 --> 0:7:34,12
We knew it was going
to be hard.


136
0:7:34,12 --> 0:7:35,91
We knew that there was going
to be a huge educational


137
0:7:35,91 --> 0:7:37,96
aspect to it, because
it's not as common


138
0:7:37,96 --> 0:7:39,21
here to have art shows.


139
0:7:39,21 --> 0:7:42,38



140
0:7:42,38 --> 0:7:43,962
How's it coming?


141
0:7:43,962 --> 0:7:44,453
Good?


142
0:7:44,453 --> 0:7:46,417
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.


143
0:7:46,417 --> 0:7:48,35
CRAIG COSTELLO: I've definitely
done some


144
0:7:48,35 --> 0:7:52,52
sculptural pieces, and I'm
really interested in working


145
0:7:52,52 --> 0:7:53,7
the sculpture.


146
0:7:53,7 --> 0:7:57,0
And this comes back to like,
this is very architectural.


147
0:7:57,0 --> 0:8:0,41
And I'm also do things that are
very minimal, and those


148
0:8:0,41 --> 0:8:2,8
things are really interesting
to me.


149
0:8:2,8 --> 0:8:8,24
So I think that this shape and
this size is really not


150
0:8:8,24 --> 0:8:9,26
foreign to me at all.


151
0:8:9,26 --> 0:8:14,4
I've done a couple of things
that have been much smaller.


152
0:8:14,4 --> 0:8:16,32
But I just felt, this space,
there was a really good


153
0:8:16,32 --> 0:8:19,54
opportunity, and Jasper
and Tiffany were down.


154
0:8:19,54 --> 0:8:23,32
And they're ambitious, and I
think this is ambitious.


155
0:8:23,32 --> 0:8:25,62
It's still a small underground
space.


156
0:8:25,62 --> 0:8:28,26
We're just trying to make
something happen that is going


157
0:8:28,26 --> 0:8:31,31
to be a little different maybe
from some of the other things


158
0:8:31,31 --> 0:8:32,56
that they've done.


159
0:8:32,56 --> 0:8:34,738



160
0:8:34,738 --> 0:8:38,33
I've definitely done a few
things like this that are


161
0:8:38,33 --> 0:8:44,32
really buildings, or large
walls, interior or exterior,


162
0:8:44,32 --> 0:8:47,35
all painted with fire
extinguishers.


163
0:8:47,35 --> 0:8:51,29
I've done all over, from
Moscow to Prague--


164
0:8:51,29 --> 0:8:52,54
I've been really fortunate.


165
0:8:52,54 --> 0:8:56,74



166
0:8:56,74 --> 0:8:57,25
Dry.


167
0:8:57,25 --> 0:8:58,5
The wall is hot.


168
0:8:58,5 --> 0:9:2,4



169
0:9:2,4 --> 0:9:4,21
You're really dealing
with architecture.


170
0:9:4,21 --> 0:9:7,84
You're dealing with the angle
of how a wall is seen.


171
0:9:7,84 --> 0:9:10,85
Or maybe it's a rooftop, and
you've got to climb to it.


172
0:9:10,85 --> 0:9:15,24
Or maybe it's got a corner, or
there's a ledge, and you've


173
0:9:15,24 --> 0:9:19,15
got to stand on a foot-wide
ledge to paint the wall.


174
0:9:19,15 --> 0:9:22,27
And you're painting a 10-foot
wall by as tall as you can


175
0:9:22,27 --> 0:9:23,71
reach or something.


176
0:9:23,71 --> 0:9:26,46
And all of those things make
you consider space really


177
0:9:26,46 --> 0:9:28,0
differently.


178
0:9:28,0 --> 0:9:30,39
And so that was a really
big influence


179
0:9:30,39 --> 0:9:33,2
for sure on my process.


180
0:9:33,2 --> 0:9:36,2
I don't write graffiti anymore,
but I still see how


181
0:9:36,2 --> 0:9:41,55
it's such a big influence on
what I do and how I do it.


182
0:9:41,55 --> 0:9:44,21
In the beginning I had done some
stuff with more colors.


183
0:9:44,21 --> 0:9:48,99
But then I just pared it down
and just kind of worked within


184
0:9:48,99 --> 0:9:50,9
a smaller palette.


185
0:9:50,9 --> 0:9:56,43
Because it was just easier
to make decisions.


186
0:9:56,43 --> 0:9:59,27
I really like yellow and blue,
and it was really just the


187
0:9:59,27 --> 0:10:4,21
blending of them making green
that became really


188
0:10:4,21 --> 0:10:5,25
interesting.


189
0:10:5,25 --> 0:10:8,12
They're very natural colors--
it's like the sun and the sky.


190
0:10:8,12 --> 0:10:9,93
And it might sound corny,
but it's true.


191
0:10:9,93 --> 0:10:11,49
And I think that there's
something that people


192
0:10:11,49 --> 0:10:13,39
recognize in that.


193
0:10:13,39 --> 0:10:16,71
With colors, because I've always
been in this urban


194
0:10:16,71 --> 0:10:21,6
environment, I can bring a lot
to those often drab places.


195
0:10:21,6 --> 0:10:23,71
So this is a cinder
block wall.


196
0:10:23,71 --> 0:10:28,63
It's not necessarily
architecturally noteworthy,


197
0:10:28,63 --> 0:10:33,74
but I think to bring color to
that is part of something that


198
0:10:33,74 --> 0:10:35,715
I'm just interested in doing.


199
0:10:35,715 --> 0:10:40,48
When you do stuff in the public
space, basically anyone


200
0:10:40,48 --> 0:10:41,6
can see it.


201
0:10:41,6 --> 0:10:45,64
It's free, and it's available,
and people come by.


202
0:10:45,64 --> 0:10:50,17
And there's a reaction, and it's
almost always positive.


203
0:10:50,17 --> 0:10:53,12
Oftentimes more people care
