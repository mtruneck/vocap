AZUZ: Fridays are awesome. I love starting
with I-reports like that one from Ms. Tiffany`s


7
0:0:34,61 --> 0:0:40,48
class. I`m Carl Azuz. This is our March, 1st
edition of CNN STUDENT NEWS. It`s also a deadline


8
0:0:40,48 --> 0:0:45,18
for the U.S. government. About $85 billion
were set to be eliminated from the federal


9
0:0:45,18 --> 0:0:49,67
budget, unless Congress and the president
can agree on the way around these automatic


10
0:0:49,67 --> 0:0:54,379
spending cuts. That`s not expected to happen,
even though none of the politicians really


11
0:0:54,379 --> 0:0:59,67
likes these cuts. Here`s the basic problem:
the government spends far more than it takes


12
0:0:59,67 --> 0:1:5,15
in. But neither the executive branch, nor
the legislative branch has total control over


13
0:1:5,15 --> 0:1:10,35
what the government spends money on. And they
disagree on how to tax and how to spend. So,


14
0:1:10,35 --> 0:1:15,14
these cuts are set to kick in the lower government
spending, and one big question is, are most


15
0:1:15,14 --> 0:1:16,5
Americans going to notice?


16
0:1:16,5 --> 0:1:17,26
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


17
0:1:17,26 --> 0:1:20,39
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: If you would
listen to only the White House, you would


18
0:1:20,39 --> 0:1:26,189
have the sense that we are going to a sequestration
nation pretty soon, and that everybody would


19
0:1:26,189 --> 0:1:30,7
be hit in all these different areas: food
safety and education and our tax returns or


20
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:36,969
national parks - everything - and this seems
to be true. If you are the right person doing


21
0:1:36,969 --> 0:1:42,9
the right thing, you in fact may see an effect
here. For example, if you are in a military


22
0:1:42,9 --> 0:1:45,88
town, and you rely on military business, you
might see an impact fairly soon. If you are


23
0:1:45,88 --> 0:1:50,88
at the airport waiting for the right flight
at the right busy time, you might have a delay.


24
0:1:50,88 --> 0:1:54,929
If you are waiting on unemployment benefits
and the check comes in lighter than, you expect,


25
0:1:54,929 --> 0:2:0,929
that would also be a real effect on you fairly
soon, but notice I`m talking about specific


26
0:2:0,929 --> 0:2:6,929
groups of people doing specific things. The
broader picture of the whole country may be


27
0:2:6,929 --> 0:2:9,96
different, and to address that I want to talk
about one of the hardest things that came


28
0:2:9,96 --> 0:2:13,569
up today, Eric Holder speaking up, and he
had this point to say in the middle of today


29
0:2:13,569 --> 0:2:19,569
where he said, look, we will be less safe,
if our budget adjusted (ph) cut next year


30
0:2:19,569 --> 0:2:26,379
from 27 billion by 1.6 billion, to 25.4 billion.
If these cut happens the nation will be less


31
0:2:26,379 --> 0:2:31,12
safe These are his words. And this is why
he says that: because he says, there will


32
0:2:31,12 --> 0:2:35,299
be furloughs at the FBI we`ll have fewer people
looking into crimes and trying to prevent


33
0:2:35,299 --> 0:2:39,53
crimes. ATF inspections of things like gun
permits, all of that, will be knocked down


34
0:2:39,53 --> 0:2:42,769
a little bit, there will be fewer people to
man the prisons, so prison will spend more


35
0:2:42,769 --> 0:2:46,93
time on lockdowns, there will fewer grants
for local law enforcement. All of this will


36
0:2:46,93 --> 0:2:50,58
make things less safe in the country, according
to him.


37
0:2:50,58 --> 0:2:56,489
This is the budget, if it gets the sequester.
$25.4 billion for next year. That`s much it


38
0:2:56,489 --> 0:3:0,37
would get. But look at this; this is a graph
of funding for the Justice Department for


39
0:3:0,37 --> 0:3:5,83
the last 11 years. And if you`ll notice, when
you look at this graph, in fact, that line


40
0:3:5,83 --> 0:3:14,99
would be right about here. So, in fact, for
the past 11 years only the past three years


41
0:3:14,99 --> 0:3:18,4
has the Justice Department had more money
than they would have under the sequester.


42
0:3:18,4 --> 0:3:23,42
So, does that mean that all these years we
were less safe? When the national crime rate


43
0:3:23,42 --> 0:3:27,799
was steadily moving down during that period
of time? These are the tough challenges out


44
0:3:27,799 --> 0:3:31,93
there, because in many ways, as Democrats
in the White House say, all these cataclysmic


45
0:3:31,93 --> 0:3:35,89
things are going to hit if the sequester comes
in. I think Republicans maybe betting on the


46
0:3:35,89 --> 0:3:40,719
idea if a few weeks pass, a couple of months
pass, and the public doesn`t notice it, because


47
0:3:40,719 --> 0:3:43,739
of things like this, then they are going to
be able to turn around to the White House


48
0:3:43,739 --> 0:3:49,56
and say, you were just trying to scare us.
You said a lot of things, and we haven`t seen


49
0:3:49,56 --> 0:3:51,1
it come to pass.

AZUZ: At 2:00 Eastern, yesterday afternoon,
the doors of a papal retreat closed. It signified


52
0:3:55,829 --> 0:4:1,14
the official end of Pope Benedict XVI papacy.
And it followed a day of good byes. In this


53
0:4:1,14 --> 0:4:5,75
last public appearances, Pope Benedict said
he was a pilgrim beginning the last leg of


54
0:4:5,75 --> 0:4:10,519
his pilgrimage on earth. In his last tweet
as pope, Benedict wrote, "Thank you for your


55
0:4:10,519 --> 0:4:14,829
love and support. May you always experience
the joy that comes from putting Christ in


56
0:4:14,829 --> 0:4:20,3
the center of your lives. This is historic,
in part, because it`s the first time in 600


57
0:4:20,3 --> 0:4:25,58
years that a papacy has ended in retirement
rather than death. At cnnstudentnews.com,


58
0:4:25,58 --> 0:4:30,94
we posted yesterday`s explainer on how the
Catholic Church will choose its next leader.


59
0:4:30,94 --> 0:4:35,55
Next up today, a bit of bad news from the
Governors Highway Safety Administration: driving


60
0:4:35,55 --> 0:4:40,93
death among American teenagers apparently
increased in 2012. The jump was almost 20


61
0:4:40,93 --> 0:4:46,17
percent over the year before. Researchers
aren`t sure why, but they`ve known for years


62
0:4:46,17 --> 0:4:50,79
that moto-vehicle accidents have been the
leading cause of death for U.S. teenagers.


63
0:4:50,79 --> 0:4:54,77
The overall rate is still lower than it was
five years ago, according to the researcher


64
0:4:54,77 --> 0:4:59,52
who led this study. But if the goal is to
decrease the number of driving related death


65
0:4:59,52 --> 0:5:4,56
every year, this is a setback. Different states
have different laws and limits on driving


66
0:5:4,56 --> 0:5:11,1
ages. Would you accept stricter teen driving
laws, if it meant the possibility of fewer


67
0:5:11,1 --> 0:5:14,37
accidents? If you are on Facebook, tell us

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Todays` "Shoutout" goes
out to Ms. Colizzi`s students at Maple Valley


70
0:5:22,8 --> 0:5:28,27
High School in Vermontville, Michigan. What
event is celebrated every year on March 8?


71
0:5:28,27 --> 0:5:34,23
You know what to do, is it International Women`s
Day, Saint Patrick`s Day, Flag Day, or Teacher


72
0:5:34,23 --> 0:5:43,43
Appreciation day? You`ve got three seconds,
go!


73
0:5:43,43 --> 0:5:48,8
it International Women`s Day has been celebrated
on March 8th, for nearly a century. That`s


74
0:5:48,8 --> 0:5:53,84
your answer and that`s your "Shoutout".


75
0:5:53,84 --> 0:5:59,88
We`re still one week away from International
Women`s Day, but today marks the start of


76
0:5:59,88 --> 0:6:4,59
women`s history month. In fact, one led to
the other: International Women`s Day goes


77
0:6:4,59 --> 0:6:9,75
all the way back to the early 1900s. The idea
came up at an International Conference of


78
0:6:9,75 --> 0:6:14,52
Working Women as a way to raise awareness
about issues affecting women around the world.


79
0:6:14,52 --> 0:6:19,81
So, fast- forward to the 1970s. Women in the
United States were planning a new event to


80
0:6:19,81 --> 0:6:24,35
celebrate the accomplishments of American
women. They picked March because well, that`s


81
0:6:24,35 --> 0:6:29,37
when the international celebration was already
taking place. Believe it or not, women`s history


82
0:6:29,37 --> 0:6:34,61
month didn`t start up as the whole month.
At first, it was women`s history week. In


83
0:6:34,61 --> 0:6:39,65
1987, Congress expanded the celebration to
the entire month of March. Every year, the


84
0:6:39,65 --> 0:6:44,62
national women`s history project picks a thing
for women`s history month. This year, it`s


85
0:6:44,62 --> 0:6:49,63
women inspiring innovation through imagination.
It`s specifically honoring women in the fields


86
0:6:49,63 --> 0:6:54,96
of science, technology, engineering and math.
But women`s history month is designed to honor


87
0:6:54,96 --> 0:6:59,34
women in all walks of life. And that`s what
we`ll be doing throughout March.

We`re looking for and considering all of your

comments at cnnstudentnews.com. Please, swing
by today, tell us what you think of this show.


91
0:7:11,85 --> 0:7:17,49
First known use of the word "robot" in 1920
in a play. First use of the word "robotics",


92
0:7:17,49 --> 0:7:23,66
1942 in a story. The actual machines are used
all over the map today in science, industry,


93
0:7:23,66 --> 0:7:29,32
medicine, war. But up until now, anyway, they
have mostly featured moving metal parts. Say


94
0:7:29,32 --> 0:7:32,82
hello to Saul Griffith, and what could be
the next generation of robots.

96
0:7:33,81 --> 0:7:37,74
SAUL GRIFFITH, CO-FOUNDER, OTHERLAB: If you
think about everything, all of the consumer


97
0:7:37,74 --> 0:7:42,49
products, every machine the humanity has ever
made, it`s, you know stiff and rigid. There`s


98
0:7:42,49 --> 0:7:47,62
a completely grained space of soft machine.
Robotics industries are most concerned with


99
0:7:47,62 --> 0:7:49,11
the number of degrees of freedom.


100
0:7:49,11 --> 0:7:49,64
SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right.


101
0:7:49,64 --> 0:7:51,86
GRIFFITH: And how much it costs for each degree
of freedom.


102
0:7:51,86 --> 0:7:58,53
Here`s a way that we could really transform
the cost of robotics. We`ll eliminate all


103
0:7:58,53 --> 0:8:2,9
the (inaudible), we`ll eliminate the pins
and the bearings and the joints. And we will


104
0:8:2,9 --> 0:8:8,8
sew you a robot out of fabric, and use pressurize
fluids to make it work. And it will reduce


105
0:8:8,8 --> 0:8:13,66
the cost of robots a hundred fold, and it
will make them (inaudible).


106
0:8:13,66 --> 0:8:17,65
The gray (ph) behind me, for example, weighs
one or two pounds. Yeah, it is the size of


107
0:8:17,65 --> 0:8:22,61
your and fully pressurized than I couldn`t,
you know, lift a human an arm`s leg.


108
0:8:22,61 --> 0:8:23,34
GUPTA: Wow.


109
0:8:23,34 --> 0:8:28,38
GRIFFITH: There`s no hinges and bearings there.
It`s all done in this tensile fabric, so it`s


110
0:8:28,38 --> 0:8:33,38
really built like a lot of biological systems
that are - this works much more like a fish


111
0:8:33,38 --> 0:8:35,709
or a shark than it does like a robot.


112
0:8:35,709 --> 0:8:36,969
(END VIDEO CLIP)


113
0:8:36,969 --> 0:8:40,75
AZUZ: We`ve talked recently about a couple
of snowstorms that have hit several states


114
0:8:40,75 --> 0:8:47,42
in the U.S. Here`s some I-reports from a student
in Iowa: drifts and shovels. Look at both


115
0:8:47,42 --> 0:8:53,69
the beauty and the work, associated with winter
weather. A teacher from Texas sent us another


116
0:8:53,69 --> 0:8:59,6
one you probably haven`t heard about, that`s
herd as in cattle, some of them got loose,


117
0:8:59,6 --> 0:9:4,5
possibly when snow covered over their fences,
and they just mooed on down the road.


118
0:9:4,5 --> 0:9:9,319
And a look at the fun side of snowstorms comes
from Kansas where some high school friends


119
0:9:9,319 --> 0:9:15,49
spend four hours building a 13 foot Franken
snowman. And it`s all pretty good, but this


120
0:9:15,49 --> 0:9:21,48
last I-report today is the icing on the snow
cone. Some students at Wale (ph) University


121
0:9:21,48 --> 0:9:26,759
in Texas apparently made the most of their
snow day, building, shaping, slicing and sculpting


122
0:9:26,759 --> 0:9:32,8
a miniature at Mount Rushmore. The glasses
detail are Mr. Roosevelt. Snow problem, when


123
0:9:32,8 --> 0:9:37,449
someone volunteered his own. It`s enough to
make fans of U.S. history melt. And never


124
0:9:37,449 --> 0:9:42,12
did George, Thomas, Teddy and Abe look so
cool. Of course, it`s neither as permanent


125
0:9:42,12 --> 0:9:46,689
nor as detailed as the real one. That sculpture
rocks. But as long as the snow stuck around,


126
0:9:46,689 --> 0:9:50,5
people thought it was pretty chill. And the
fact that George Washington had wooden teeth


127
0:9:50,5 --> 0:9:54,509
might have kept them from chattering in all
that cold. That`s all for CNN STUDENT NEWS.


128
0:9:54,509 --> 0:11:54,509
I`m sorry, we`ve run out of time. In the future,
I`ll just have to rush more. See you..
