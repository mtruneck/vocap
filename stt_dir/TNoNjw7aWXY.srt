[MUSIC PLAYING]


2
0:0:9,61 --> 0:0:10,56
DAMIAN SANDERS: Life is
about taking risks.


3
0:0:10,56 --> 0:0:12,88
If you don't take risks,
why even live?


4
0:0:12,88 --> 0:0:15,67
What fun is it to walk around
on a rubber world and be


5
0:0:15,67 --> 0:0:16,77
afraid of everything?


6
0:0:16,77 --> 0:0:19,86
You got to out there and try to
outdo people, because then


7
0:0:19,86 --> 0:0:21,6
it's progression of the world.


8
0:0:21,6 --> 0:0:23,941
It makes it more fun to live.


9
0:0:23,941 --> 0:0:25,32
You got to go big, and the next
guy is going to to try to


10
0:0:25,32 --> 0:0:26,542
go bigger, and that's
what it's all about.


11
0:0:26,542 --> 0:0:29,1
JERRY DUGAN: Damian was one of
the most comfortable people in


12
0:0:29,1 --> 0:0:33,1
the air for sure at that point
and probably to this day.


13
0:0:33,1 --> 0:0:36,25
I mean he just had a sense about
him in the air where he


14
0:0:36,25 --> 0:0:38,14
was just totally comfortable
up there.


15
0:0:38,14 --> 0:0:42,43
DON SZABO: Damian was real
influential, and go, go, go on


16
0:0:42,43 --> 0:0:46,52
building jumps and having fun
and getting footage and just


17
0:0:46,52 --> 0:0:47,3
riding, you know.


18
0:0:47,3 --> 0:0:48,79
We just loved to ride.


19
0:0:48,79 --> 0:0:51,23
TOM BURT: Damian Sanders was so
much fun to watch because


20
0:0:51,23 --> 0:0:54,87
he had just incredible
style in the air.


21
0:0:54,87 --> 0:0:57,56
Pretty much no one touched
his style for years.


22
0:0:57,56 --> 0:1:1,31
When the video realm came in, it
was kind of like Damian was


23
0:1:1,31 --> 0:1:2,43
on top of that.


24
0:1:2,43 --> 0:1:4,22
KEVIN ENGLISH: There's this one
shot in "Snowboarders in


25
0:1:4,22 --> 0:1:7,1
Exile" where the camera's real
low, and it's looking at


26
0:1:7,1 --> 0:1:9,91
Damian, and he's just pointing
up, and that's how I felt.


27
0:1:9,91 --> 0:1:12,52
It was like that's Damian.


28
0:1:12,52 --> 0:1:14,47
DAVE SEOANE: Well, the first
time I saw Damian, I was


29
0:1:14,47 --> 0:1:15,68
actually still in high school.


30
0:1:15,68 --> 0:1:17,32
And I knew Damian from--


31
0:1:17,32 --> 0:1:19,62
he lived near where I
grew up in an area


32
0:1:19,62 --> 0:1:20,55
called Calaveras County.


33
0:1:20,55 --> 0:1:24,1
And he had a big quarter pipe
at his house which is like a


34
0:1:24,1 --> 0:1:26,3
half hour away so we'd skate.


35
0:1:26,3 --> 0:1:28,32
And then the first time I saw
him snowboarding was in Iron


36
0:1:28,32 --> 0:1:30,16
Mountain in probably '85.


37
0:1:30,16 --> 0:1:31,96
And I remember they were all
riding these Avalanche


38
0:1:31,96 --> 0:1:33,78
snowboards, and they were kind
of really like really stiff


39
0:1:33,78 --> 0:1:35,16
ironing boards.


40
0:1:35,16 --> 0:1:37,49
I watched Damian ride down the
hill, and he grabbed the lift


41
0:1:37,49 --> 0:1:40,93
tower, and he grabbed it, and
he spun around 360 like a


42
0:1:40,93 --> 0:1:41,905
couple inches off the ground.


43
0:1:41,905 --> 0:1:44,4
I was like, wow, he's so good.


44
0:1:44,4 --> 0:1:45,98
That guy's spectacular.


45
0:1:45,98 --> 0:1:47,57
He's got good hair.


46
0:1:47,57 --> 0:1:50,51
I think he was just like the
city kid who moved to the


47
0:1:50,51 --> 0:1:54,5
hills, and so he had
spiky, blond hair


48
0:1:54,5 --> 0:1:56,61
and spider web eyeliner.


49
0:1:56,61 --> 0:2:1,15
So Damian learned how to
fight really quick.


50
0:2:1,15 --> 0:2:2,895
DAMIAN SANDERS: I was moving
from San Jose where I lived as


51
0:2:2,895 --> 0:2:5,68
a city boy kid, skateboarder and
stuff, and I was young, 13


52
0:2:5,68 --> 0:2:8,229
years old, and we were moving
up to Bear Valley.


53
0:2:8,229 --> 0:2:10,38
And I wanted to buy a Burton
snowboard, it was the only


54
0:2:10,38 --> 0:2:11,97
snowboard company that even
existed, or that I


55
0:2:11,97 --> 0:2:13,19
knew about back then.


56
0:2:13,19 --> 0:2:15,26
And my brother told my mom to
hold off because he was going


57
0:2:15,26 --> 0:2:15,74
to make a snowboard.


58
0:2:15,74 --> 0:2:18,7
He had a little wood shop going,
and sure enough I got


59
0:2:18,7 --> 0:2:19,68
that snowboard, the first one
he ever made, the first


60
0:2:19,68 --> 0:2:21,57
Avalanche ever in '83.


61
0:2:21,57 --> 0:2:22,69
We went up to the
local mountain.


62
0:2:22,69 --> 0:2:25,2
I made about six or eight turns
on my first run ever


63
0:2:25,2 --> 0:2:27,33
just in the powder, just
bouncing turns, and was


64
0:2:27,33 --> 0:2:28,39
flipping my lid, thinking
it was the


65
0:2:28,39 --> 0:2:29,83
best thing ever invented.


66
0:2:29,83 --> 0:2:32,7
There was a competition at
Soda Springs, the world


67
0:2:32,7 --> 0:2:34,98
championships, and this has
would have been about '85.


68
0:2:34,98 --> 0:2:36,66
And I didn't even know there was
other snowboarders in the


69
0:2:36,66 --> 0:2:38,26
world, let alone have a
world championship.


70
0:2:38,26 --> 0:2:40,37
So I went over to that, and I
remember walking around the


71
0:2:40,37 --> 0:2:42,65
corner from the parking lot,
and I saw about 50 boards


72
0:2:42,65 --> 0:2:44,82
lined up in front of
this lodge, and I


73
0:2:44,82 --> 0:2:45,39
about shit my pants.


74
0:2:45,39 --> 0:2:46,65
I couldn't believe there
was 50 other


75
0:2:46,65 --> 0:2:47,98
snowboarders in the world.


76
0:2:47,98 --> 0:2:50,1
And so I went into the lodge and
everybody's all the same


77
0:2:50,1 --> 0:2:52,68
type of people, these surf rat
looking guys, skaters.


78
0:2:52,68 --> 0:2:54,86
Back then, if you snowboarded
and somebody else snowboard,


79
0:2:54,86 --> 0:2:56,56
you were instantly friends
because there


80
0:2:56,56 --> 0:2:57,94
was so few of us.


81
0:2:57,94 --> 0:3:1,105
I had way more balls than brains
back then, so I would


82
0:3:1,105 --> 0:3:3,17
hit any jump just for people to
go, holy shit, you see that


83
0:3:3,17 --> 0:3:4,47
kid fly off that jump.


84
0:3:4,47 --> 0:3:7,48
I had a little, white mohawk,
and I just dressed like a


85
0:3:7,48 --> 0:3:9,39
little new wave fag.


86
0:3:9,39 --> 0:3:12,57
So I was hitting all the jumps I
could, and just to show off,


87
0:3:12,57 --> 0:3:14,38
I would break my neck to show
off, and sure enough I ended


88
0:3:14,38 --> 0:3:17,425
up in the hospital on that Soda
Springs competition, but


89
0:3:17,425 --> 0:3:19,43
it was pretty fun doing it.


90
0:3:19,43 --> 0:3:22,1
MIKE MCENTIRE: Damian was one
of the most ballsiest people


91
0:3:22,1 --> 0:3:25,26
that's ever been involved
in snowboarding.


92
0:3:25,26 --> 0:3:27,81
To this day, you can look back
at his footage from like


93
0:3:27,81 --> 0:3:31,14
20-plus years ago, and
it's fully legit.


94
0:3:31,14 --> 0:3:35,4
The guy was jumping off 60-foot
cliffs for fun.


95
0:3:35,4 --> 0:3:38,63
And I would go up and riding
at Squaw, and I'd just be


96
0:3:38,63 --> 0:3:41,24
taking runs with my boys and
look up, and there's Damian


97
0:3:41,24 --> 0:3:43,34
popping off mainline
going like 50 feet


98
0:3:43,34 --> 0:3:44,31
for the hell of it.


99
0:3:44,31 --> 0:3:49,17
And you're like, damn dude,
what's up with that guy, he's


100
0:3:49,17 --> 0:3:51,25
freaking nuts.


101
0:3:51,25 --> 0:3:55,54
I saw him bust out some stuff,
no cameras, just


102
0:3:55,54 --> 0:3:57,64
gigantic, for fun.


103
0:3:57,64 --> 0:3:58,35
That's killer, man.


104
0:3:58,35 --> 0:3:58,87
I love that.


105
0:3:58,87 --> 0:4:2,936
That just shows you where it's
in someone's heart, you know.


106
0:4:2,936 --> 0:4:3,92
SPEAKER: What do you
think the silliest


107
0:4:3,92 --> 0:4:5,17
snowboarding trick is?


108
0:4:5,17 --> 0:4:8,84



109
0:4:8,84 --> 0:4:11,31
DAMIAN SANDERS: Every trick
I did last year.


110
0:4:11,31 --> 0:4:13,7
When people started flipping
that was a huge deal.


111
0:4:13,7 --> 0:4:15,36
The first flips ever, we were
all on this little jump exit,


112
0:4:15,36 --> 0:4:16,79
Donner Ski Ranch.


113
0:4:16,79 --> 0:4:17,48
It was right underneath the
chairlift, and it was like a


114
0:4:17,48 --> 0:4:18,95
little ski jump kicker.


115
0:4:18,95 --> 0:4:20,57
I think it was Steve
Graham and myself.


116
0:4:20,57 --> 0:4:21,39
Steve was a nut.


117
0:4:21,39 --> 0:4:23,5
He would do anything any time.


118
0:4:23,5 --> 0:4:26,5
I remember trying it over and
over again, and doing 3/4 of a


119
0:4:26,5 --> 0:4:28,26
flip so many times, just
clearing my head, and smacking


120
0:4:28,26 --> 0:4:29,62
the snow again and again.


121
0:4:29,62 --> 0:4:31,73
And then finally one time they
came all around, landed on my


122
0:4:31,73 --> 0:4:32,9
feet, and I about shit myself.


123
0:4:32,9 --> 0:4:34,54
I'm still standing!


124
0:4:34,54 --> 0:4:37,6
Rode away from it and then
started getting bigger and


125
0:4:37,6 --> 0:4:38,56
bigger, and then I started
laying them out, and then once


126
0:4:38,56 --> 0:4:40,97
you can lay it out and control
your spin, then you'd sit


127
0:4:40,97 --> 0:4:42,86
there upside down, and go do
I want to pull around yet.


128
0:4:42,86 --> 0:4:44,34
And then you can do it
off of anything.


129
0:4:44,34 --> 0:4:47,425
So I was hucking huge airs off
of cliffs or huge kickers, and


130
0:4:47,425 --> 0:4:48,975
just stalling it out in the air,
and grabbing the board


131
0:4:48,975 --> 0:4:51,34
and, poking it, and just looking
down on at the ground.


132
0:4:51,34 --> 0:4:53,11
Back then it was so cool because
no one could do it.


133
0:4:53,11 --> 0:4:56,52
Now it would be nothing, but
it was cool at the time.


134
0:4:56,52 --> 0:4:59,72
There was guys that could flip
before I could, but nobody was


135
0:4:59,72 --> 0:5:0,495
grabbing their board
or anything.


136
0:5:0,495 --> 0:5:2,79
I think I invented the iguana
back flip and some other


137
0:5:2,79 --> 0:5:4,6
things where I was trying to
grab different ways upside


138
0:5:4,6 --> 0:5:8,37
down, and that was like after
doing flips for almost a year.


139
0:5:8,37 --> 0:5:11,88
KEVIN ENGLISH: Damien, Squaw
Valley, doing massive iguana


140
0:5:11,88 --> 0:5:15,21
back flips, and it
was ridiculous.


141
0:5:15,21 --> 0:5:18,48
TODD RICHARDS: For a while, he
was full grabbing wherever,


142
0:5:18,48 --> 0:5:20,76
like back here, but you couldn't
even say shit because


143
0:5:20,76 --> 0:5:24,49
Damien was going 10 times bigger
than anybody else.


144
0:5:24,49 --> 0:5:25,51
I still say that today.


145
0:5:25,51 --> 0:5:29,4
Like if you're going 25 feet out
of the half pipe and you


146
0:5:29,4 --> 0:5:34,2
just happen to just do the
wackest grab, we'd be like,


147
0:5:34,2 --> 0:5:35,5
oh, that's gay.


148
0:5:35,5 --> 0:5:38,6
The dude is still going way
bigger than you'll ever go,


149
0:5:38,6 --> 0:5:39,47
and it's insane.


150
0:5:39,47 --> 0:5:42,1
At some point, you're just
like, who gives a shit.


151
0:5:42,1 --> 0:5:44,5
STEVE GRAHAM: Damian was always
my favorite rider.


152
0:5:44,5 --> 0:5:46,39
I still wish he was
riding now.


153
0:5:46,39 --> 0:5:48,25
I'd love to ride with him.


154
0:5:48,25 --> 0:5:52,47
My funnest times ever riding was
back in the early days in


155
0:5:52,47 --> 0:5:57,26
Tahoe just chasing Damian, and
we were just a couple idiots


156
0:5:57,26 --> 0:5:58,51
that wouldn't look
at anything.


157
0:5:58,51 --> 0:5:59,39
Just, what do you think?


158
0:5:59,39 --> 0:6:1,45
Oh yeah, [INAUDIBLE].


159
0:6:1,45 --> 0:6:3,85
No landing, no woo-hoo.


160
0:6:3,85 --> 0:6:8,18
And just we pulled that
off for awhile.


161
0:6:8,18 --> 0:6:9,84
I don't know how I'm
still even walking.


162
0:6:9,84 --> 0:6:10,89
I was taller.


163
0:6:10,89 --> 0:6:15,3
The scariest time I've ever had
snowboarding is really any


164
0:6:15,3 --> 0:6:19,97
day we'd go riding with Damian
'cause if there's anyone


165
0:6:19,97 --> 0:6:22,56
[INAUDIBLE] that.


166
0:6:22,56 --> 0:6:27,16
He's going the biggest, the
highest, the fastest and


167
0:6:27,16 --> 0:6:28,446
pushes you.


168
0:6:28,446 --> 0:6:30,1
DAMIAN SANDERS: I'd have to say
Steve Graham was probably


169
0:6:30,1 --> 0:6:32,43
my favorite of all time because
he was such a badass


170
0:6:32,43 --> 0:6:35,5
rider, and he would do anything
at any time, hucking


171
0:6:35,5 --> 0:6:37,38
off of cliffs and stuff, and
he really pushed me.


172
0:6:37,38 --> 0:6:39,42
He pushed me more than anybody
ever did in snowboarding.


173
0:6:39,42 --> 0:6:41,73
We saw things different than
other people did because we


174
0:6:41,73 --> 0:6:44,32
were both at the same
talent caliber.


175
0:6:44,32 --> 0:6:46,41
We could see how you could hit
a jump and fly 80 feet over


176
0:6:46,41 --> 0:6:47,56
there and land on
the downhill.


177
0:6:47,56 --> 0:6:49,41
It was something else that
nobody else could see because


178
0:6:49,41 --> 0:6:52,6
it was just out of their realm,
and I had more fun


179
0:6:52,6 --> 0:6:54,42
riding with him than anybody
because of that.


180
0:6:54,42 --> 0:6:55,65
DAVE SEOANE: I think that
Steve Graham is a total


181
0:6:55,65 --> 0:6:58,41
catalyst to Damian because both
those guys were kind of


182
0:6:58,41 --> 0:7:0,77
out of their minds, where I
think Damian had a lot more


183
0:7:0,77 --> 0:7:3,75
control of what he was doing,
and Steve just went for it,


184
0:7:3,75 --> 0:7:5,83
shoot first, ask questions
later type of


185
0:7:5,83 --> 0:7:7,48
personality back then.


186
0:7:7,48 --> 0:7:11,7
And so those two together,
that's where I think the sport


187
0:7:11,7 --> 0:7:13,43
really got pushed, with those
two guys jumping off of things


188
0:7:13,43 --> 0:7:17,13
and flipping off of everything
really big.


189
0:7:17,13 --> 0:7:18,1
Yeah, I guess that's
the biggest thing I


190
0:7:18,1 --> 0:7:19,35
was influenced by.


191
0:7:19,35 --> 0:7:21,47



192
0:7:21,47 --> 0:7:23,43
KEVIN ENGLISH: For like
personal style?


193
0:7:23,43 --> 0:7:26,5
It was like, Damian
was the guy, just


194
0:7:26,5 --> 0:7:27,1
because he was so unique.


195
0:7:27,1 --> 0:7:32,17
My hair was fully blond, Damian
style fauxhawk kind of


196
0:7:32,17 --> 0:7:35,29
thing going, and then I'd take
the hair spray and get it to


197
0:7:35,29 --> 0:7:37,2
go straight up, and
I'd do this before


198
0:7:37,2 --> 0:7:39,74
I'd ride every day.


199
0:7:39,74 --> 0:7:42,26
I'd look in the mirror, and
I'd be like yeah, Damian,


200
0:7:42,26 --> 0:7:43,25
that's pretty sick.


201
0:7:43,25 --> 0:7:46,79
I saw how Damian wrote his name
in all capital letters.


202
0:7:46,79 --> 0:7:50,27
It was just Damian, that's all
it was, so I started signing


203
0:7:50,27 --> 0:7:52,69
my name that way.


204
0:7:52,69 --> 0:7:56,3
I'd say he influenced me a
little when I was a kid.


205
0:7:56,3 --> 0:7:57,76
DAMIAN SANDERS: Getting all
that popularity was so fun


206
0:7:57,76 --> 0:7:58,67
back then especially
when you're young.


207
0:7:58,67 --> 0:8:1,37
You're in your early '20s or
late teens, and everybody


208
0:8:1,37 --> 0:8:2,69
knows your name, and
everybody's,


209
0:8:2,69 --> 0:8:3,64
can I get your autograph?


210
0:8:3,64 --> 0:8:5,6
TODD RICHARDS: Damian
was a spectacle.


211
0:8:5,6 --> 0:8:8,35
In all those movies, he was the
dude out back flipping the


212
0:8:8,35 --> 0:8:11,12
landing, landing would just,
[WHOOSHING SOUND], be gone.


213
0:8:11,12 --> 0:8:13,93
He'd land out on the flats or
go bigger than anybody.


214
0:8:13,93 --> 0:8:19,1
He had the Penthouse chick, was
his girlfriend, and she


215
0:8:19,1 --> 0:8:21,14
was always naked, and he was
always trying to show you


216
0:8:21,14 --> 0:8:24,21
pictures of her without her
clothes on, and he had the


217
0:8:24,21 --> 0:8:28,5
stupid hair, and he had a posse
of weird dudes dressed


218
0:8:28,5 --> 0:8:30,99
in black that may or may not
have been women, I don't know.


219
0:8:30,99 --> 0:8:33,929
It was just like weird
weirdness, but that was


220
0:8:33,929 --> 0:8:35,419
Damian, and it was just like,
oh, here comes Damian.


221
0:8:35,419 --> 0:8:37,94



222
0:8:37,94 --> 0:8:40,539
TOM BURT: He's definitely set
himself out from the crowd.


223
0:8:40,539 --> 0:8:44,11
He had his Billy Idol hairdo and
his headband, but that's


224
0:8:44,11 --> 0:8:48,26
just what was going on, neon
was in at that time.


225
0:8:48,26 --> 0:8:51,13
Damian was the guy you wanted in
your house to have over for


226
0:8:51,13 --> 0:8:52,8
dinner because he's going to
do the dishes before he


227
0:8:52,8 --> 0:8:56,33
leaves, but his image
might not have


228
0:8:56,33 --> 0:8:59,38
shown that to the public.


229
0:8:59,38 --> 0:9:0,32
DAMIAN SANDERS: Back
then, snowboard


230
0:9:0,32 --> 0:9:1,94
clothes barely existed.


231
0:9:1,94 --> 0:9:3,256
And it was like we were wearing
anything that we


232
0:9:3,256 --> 0:9:5,75
either we got off the street
that we wore to a nightclub,


233
0:9:5,75 --> 0:9:7,41
or we would wear leather
jackets with


234
0:9:7,41 --> 0:9:8,94
logos on the back.


235
0:9:8,94 --> 0:9:10,85
It was pretty funny.


236
0:9:10,85 --> 0:9:13,26
And anything that mixed with ski
gear because there was no


237
0:9:13,26 --> 0:9:15,49
such thing as snowboard company
or snowboard gear yet.


238
0:9:15,49 --> 0:9:18,98
STEVE GRAHAM: I don't know, I
think Damian kind of liked a


239
0:9:18,98 --> 0:9:22,526
couple of pieces more
than he lets you on.


240
0:9:22,526 --> 0:9:25,9
Like in "Exile," he was wearing
that one, it was like


241
0:9:25,9 --> 0:9:25,8
four colors.


242
0:9:25,8 --> 0:9:30,91
It was amazingly painful,
but I don't know, it was


243
0:9:30,91 --> 0:9:32,83
just at that time.


244
0:9:32,83 --> 0:9:39,9
'89 was just neon, and I see
it come back like neon tie


245
0:9:39,9 --> 0:9:46,24
dye, and just two things
I really love.


246
0:9:46,24 --> 0:9:48,33
TODD RICHARDS: We need someone
like Damian in the industry


247
0:9:48,33 --> 0:9:53,87
still, especially someone that's
got that much flair,


248
0:9:53,87 --> 0:9:57,6
and he's out there, but at the
same time, he could get along


249
0:9:57,6 --> 0:9:59,88
with anyone's grandparents as
soon as they got over the fact


250
0:9:59,88 --> 0:10:3,71
that he had a freaking mohawk,
he's just a nice dude.


251
0:10:3,71 --> 0:10:5,38
DAMIAN SANDERS: Funny story
about how Dana Nicholson and


252
0:10:5,38 --> 0:10:6,26
Jeff Miles and I met.


253
0:10:6,26 --> 0:10:8,31
I was with Palmer on the lift,
and we're cruising up, and I


254
0:10:8,31 --> 0:10:10,56
see these two guys in leather
jackets, black


255
0:10:10,56 --> 0:10:12,35
pants, and red berets.


256
0:10:12,35 --> 0:10:16,36
They looked like total LA
gangster type guys, and it was


257
0:10:16,36 --> 0:10:18,68
so funny, gangsters back in the
day with a little bit of


258
0:10:18,68 --> 0:10:19,26
fashion to them.


259
0:10:19,26 --> 0:10:20,745
So they're snowboarding
underneath me and, I go look


260
0:10:20,745 --> 0:10:22,17
at those guys, those
guys are cool.


261
0:10:22,17 --> 0:10:22,96
And Shaun Palmer's all.


262
0:10:22,96 --> 0:10:24,39
What a fag.


263
0:10:24,39 --> 0:10:26,32
And then I snowboard up to them
and, oh, how you guys


264
0:10:26,32 --> 0:10:27,88
doing, and they're all hey
what's up, and they acted like


265
0:10:27,88 --> 0:10:28,94
they didn't know who I was.


266
0:10:28,94 --> 0:10:30,59
And so we started riding
together just 'cause everybody


267
0:10:30,59 --> 0:10:33,47
kind of was friends back then,
and come to find out they


268
0:10:33,47 --> 0:10:35,97
traveled from Southern
California all the way to this


269
0:10:35,97 --> 0:10:38,4
resort to meet me 'cause they
knew I rode there, and they


270
0:10:38,4 --> 0:10:39,416
had seen me in magazines, and
they were all we want to ride


271
0:10:39,416 --> 0:10:41,21
with that guy, that guy
should be our friend.


272
0:10:41,21 --> 0:10:43,13
And sure enough, I just
saw them and go


273
0:10:43,13 --> 0:10:44,37
these guys are cool.


274
0:10:44,37 --> 0:10:45,3
So the rest was history.


275
0:10:45,3 --> 0:10:48,66
We ended up being friends
for 25 years now.


276
0:10:48,66 --> 0:10:50,2
The three of us have never
left each other's sides.


277
0:10:50,2 --> 0:10:51,31
We travelled the world
like that.

to drive yet.

were 16 right there dude.

know how to drive.

0:11:4,19 --> 0:11:6,5
DANA NICHOLSON: I got pink pants
on, but he looks like a


290
0:11:6,5 --> 0:11:8,34

should've


298
0:11:17,41 --> 0:11:18,26
pulled me aside and--


299
0:11:18,26 --> 0:11:19,41

those gloves, what the fuck am

I ever went to,

competition, that's my
style back then.

0:11:44,235 --> 0:11:47,8
Yeah, like no high backs, and
there's just little straps

piece of shit bindings.

know how we came up with this.

in the day, everybody


320

thought you had to wear these
speed suits to race.

DAMIAN SANDERS: No,
it never worked.


325
0:12:3,65 --> 0:12:6,7
And what happened is I put
this on, and then I had a


326
0:12:6,7 --> 0:12:8,64
shirt or a jacket, and then
somebody took a picture of it,


327
0:12:8,64 --> 0:12:10,335
and it ended up in a magazine,
and then every single time we


328
0:12:10,335 --> 0:12:11,18
had a photo shoot they
were all, could you


329
0:12:11,18 --> 0:12:12,17
wear the green outfit?


330
0:12:12,17 --> 0:12:14,33
That photographed real well.

0:12:14,33 --> 0:12:15,86
Fuck, the green outfit again?

0:12:15,86 --> 0:12:18,47
That's got a Donner
ticket on it.


333

15 years ago

337
0:12:22,81 --> 0:12:24,65
So we used to have to take our
shells off because they were


338
0:12:24,65 --> 0:12:26,305
hard boot shells, and we'd
walk around in the inner


339
0:12:26,305 --> 0:12:27,66
liners, and then when you
got to the resort, you'd


340
0:12:27,66 --> 0:12:28,905
put your shells on.


341
0:12:28,905 --> 0:12:30,26
DANA NICHOLSON: But the thing
is, dude, we'd ride these


342
0:12:30,26 --> 0:12:34,666
ironing boards, and we' killed
everybody on the hard boots.


343
0:12:34,666 --> 0:12:35,78
We just crushed them.


344
0:12:35,78 --> 0:12:37,6
DAMIAN SANDERS: When this came
out, I remember I was so


345
0:12:37,6 --> 0:12:38,65
pissed, because this was the
first time I'd ever grabbed


346
0:12:38,65 --> 0:12:41,58
the board on a back flip,
and my leg blocked it.


347
0:12:41,58 --> 0:12:43,59
And so I was all fuck, nobody's
gonna know, and back


348
0:12:43,59 --> 0:12:45,9
then it mattered so much what
your friends thought about if


349
0:12:45,9 --> 0:12:48,165

grab back flip or something.

right across the street.

This was in Carmelo or
something, but they had one

0:12:57,1 --> 0:12:58,24
right across the street where
we were hanging out at the

look at that billboard.
