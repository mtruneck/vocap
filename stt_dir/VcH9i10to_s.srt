CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: At the edge of the
fiscal cliff - U.S. government didn`t go over


2
0:0:5,69 --> 0:0:10,98
the edge, but it didn`t exactly solve the
crisis either. First up on CNN STUDENT NEWS


3
0:0:10,98 --> 0:0:21,79
today is how Congress and the president sort
of backed away from the edge.


4
0:0:21,79 --> 0:0:33,289
It came down to a vote in the U.S. House of
Representatives on Tuesday night, the Senate


5
0:0:33,289 --> 0:0:37,63
had already passed a temporary fix to the
fiscal cliff, but the House had to approve


6
0:0:37,63 --> 0:0:42,86
that plan and for the president to sign it
and to make it law. When the votes were counted,


7
0:0:42,86 --> 0:0:49,67
representatives have voted 257 to 161 to approve
the plan. It`s not perfect. Many lawmakers


8
0:0:49,67 --> 0:0:53,53
don`t like it. For one thing, it does not
reduce government spending, something that


9
0:0:53,53 --> 0:0:58,77
will need to get done in order to reduce the
debt. It does raise taxes on families that


10
0:0:58,77 --> 0:1:5,6
make more than $450,000 a year. It`s the first
federal income tax hike since 1993. And it


11
0:1:5,6 --> 0:1:11,0
does put off some other tax raises and automatic
government spending cuts that would have happened


12
0:1:11,0 --> 0:1:15,67
if no agreement had been made, but if the
government had done this for a grade, it wouldn`t


13
0:1:15,67 --> 0:1:20,49
be an A, it wouldn`t really be an F. It`d
be an "Incomplete." Christine Romans explains


14
0:1:20,49 --> 0:1:20,76
why.

16
0:1:21,299 --> 0:1:24,49
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Part
of the fiscal cliff was averted, but there


17
0:1:24,49 --> 0:1:29,31
are two big issues not addressed in the bill:
the spending cuts or the sequester, that issue


18
0:1:29,31 --> 0:1:34,14
was delayed two months. Two, there`s nothing
about the debt ceiling in this bill either.


19
0:1:34,14 --> 0:1:40,68
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner says the government
has officially reached its limit, its $16.394


20
0:1:40,68 --> 0:1:45,33
debt limit. Some analysts are warning that
the gridlock in Washington is what could cause


21
0:1:45,33 --> 0:1:50,99
as even worse, more problems. Steven Englander,
CitiFX said, quote "The process was so chaotic


22
0:1:50,99 --> 0:1:55,38
and the outcome so unsatisfactory, that we`re
likely to see a further U.S. downgrade at


23
0:1:55,38 --> 0:2:0,7
some point. All this drama in Washington could
well put the breaks on Wall Street. Christine

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? Article
1 of the U.S. Constitution focuses on the


28
0:2:8,789 --> 0:2:11,99
powers of the presidency.


29
0:2:11,99 --> 0:2:16,47
Not true. Article 1 is all about the powers
of Congress.

31
0:2:18,5 --> 0:2:25,9
AZUZ: There is new Congress in town, the 113th
Congress of the United States, it`s getting


32
0:2:25,9 --> 0:2:30,87
started today. All 435 voting members of the
U.S. House of Representatives were elected


33
0:2:30,87 --> 0:2:36,69
last November. Representatives serve two year
terms, and they are chosen in even numbered


34
0:2:36,69 --> 0:2:40,45
years. The more people a state has living
in it, the more representatives it has in


35
0:2:40,45 --> 0:2:46,34
Congress. And in the 113th Congress the House
is controlled by Republicans who hold 234


36
0:2:46,34 --> 0:2:52,45
seats, Democrats have 201 seats. Things are
different in the Senate. There are 100 Senators


37
0:2:52,45 --> 0:2:56,94
there, two for each state, and they serve
six year terms, so only about a third of their


38
0:2:56,94 --> 0:3:2,56
seats were up for election in November. Democrats
have controlled the Senate with 53 seats,


39
0:3:2,56 --> 0:3:7,519
Republicans have 45 seats, and two seats are
Independent, though the Independents usually


40
0:3:7,519 --> 0:3:12,65
vote with the Democrats. Some of the top priorities
of the new Congress: a longer term solution


41
0:3:12,65 --> 0:3:17,849
of the fiscal cliff as we talked about, getting
federal money to victims of Hurricane Sandy.


42
0:3:17,849 --> 0:3:21,459
And generally, figuring out what the government
spends money on.


43
0:3:21,459 --> 0:3:25,26
With Democrats in control of the Senate and
the presidency and Republicans in control


44
0:3:25,26 --> 0:3:29,849
of the House, you can see it`s going to take
compromise to get legislation passed.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Time for "The Shoutout.":
which of these documents is the oldest? If


47
0:3:36,48 --> 0:3:38,55
you think you know it, then shout it out!


48
0:3:38,55 --> 0:3:47,72
Is it the Dead Sea scrolls? Gutenberg Bible,
Declaration of Independence or Beowulf? You`ve


49
0:3:47,72 --> 0:3:53,69
got three seconds, go!


50
0:3:53,69 --> 0:3:58,129
The Dead Sea scrolls date back to the 3rd
Century, B.C. Which makes them the oldest


51
0:3:58,129 --> 0:4:3,18
of those documents. That`s your answer and
that`s your "Shoutout."

AZUZ: The Dead Sea scrolls were discovered
in caves between Israel and Jordan. Many of


54
0:4:10,8 --> 0:4:14,799
the manuscripts appear on parchment, those
are animal skins used for writing in ancient


55
0:4:14,799 --> 0:4:19,699
times. A new project is bridging thousands
of years of technology, bringing the scrolls


56
0:4:19,699 --> 0:4:24,469
to your classroom, or to your living room.
Sara Sidner shows you how this biblical and


57
0:4:24,469 --> 0:4:27,15
ancient texts can be as close as a click.

59
0:4:27,719 --> 0:4:32,809
SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The painstaking
process to preserve a tiny piece of history,


60
0:4:32,809 --> 0:4:38,939
more than 2,000 years old. In this delicate
pieces of ancient parchment you can see the


61
0:4:38,939 --> 0:4:45,139
text of the Ten Commandments, Genesis, Psalms,
many of the writings that make up the Bible,


62
0:4:45,139 --> 0:4:50,949
as well as other non- biblical books. These
are some of the thousands of fragments of


63
0:4:50,949 --> 0:4:58,139
the Dead Sea scrolls found by a Bedouin shepherd
in caves 65 years ago near the Dead Sea and


64
0:4:58,139 --> 0:4:59,46
what is now the West Bank.


65
0:4:59,46 --> 0:5:3,619
PHINA SHOR, ISRAEL ANTIQUITIES AUTHORITY:
These are all manuscripts written 2,000 years


66
0:5:3,619 --> 0:5:9,46
ago at the time when both Judaism and Christianity
were formalizing as we know them today.


67
0:5:9,46 --> 0:5:14,77
SIDNER: There are only five conservators on
the planet allowed to handle these fragments,


68
0:5:14,77 --> 0:5:20,309
which when pieced together reveal some of
the holiest and well-known texts of the world.


69
0:5:20,309 --> 0:5:26,899
Now they are available for anyone to sea and
study online. A joint project between Google


70
0:5:26,899 --> 0:5:32,33
and Israel`s Antiquity Authority. The five
year process included photographing thousands


71
0:5:32,33 --> 0:5:38,71
of fragments, 28 times each front and back
using different colors of the spectrum and


72
0:5:38,71 --> 0:5:42,999
NASA technology to reveal previously undetectable
writings.


73
0:5:42,999 --> 0:5:46,399
SHAI HALEVI, DEAD SEA SCROLLS PHOTOGRAPHER:
Then I`m getting older exposures on the screen,


74
0:5:46,399 --> 0:5:48,659
and I`m combining them all into one multispectral
image.


75
0:5:48,659 --> 0:5:55,139
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`re going to integrate
at this point the infrared image of this part,


76
0:5:55,139 --> 0:6:4,279
exactly this part, and no secret writings
are going to be revealed by the infrared image.


77
0:6:4,279 --> 0:6:10,119
SIDNER: In the 1950s, the scrolls were photographed
and last year, five of the 900 manuscripts


78
0:6:10,119 --> 0:6:16,589
were put on the Internet. But for this project,
nearly all 900 manuscripts are online and


79
0:6:16,589 --> 0:6:22,969
1000 of the fragments have been enhanced by
the new technology. Controversy has followed


80
0:6:22,969 --> 0:6:28,469
these scrolls from the day they were discovered.
Arguments bound over who actually wrote them


81
0:6:28,469 --> 0:6:34,179
and who owns them. Now that they are available
to the entire world for crowd sourcing, who


82
0:6:34,179 --> 0:6:40,419
knows what new controversies or perhaps answers
can be uncovered in these ancient writing.

AZUZ: Fascinating stuff.


86
0:6:44,89 --> 0:6:49,309
Have you ever heard of Havard Rugland? Probably
not. You might have seen his work on Youtube.


87
0:6:49,309 --> 0:6:54,589
He is a sort of trick shot champion, but with
a foot in football instead of a basket in


88
0:6:54,589 --> 0:6:58,889
basketball. He says nothing about what you
are seeing here is faked, though some of the


89
0:6:58,889 --> 0:7:3,509
shots did take more than one try. The video
went viral on Youtube and the coolest part


90
0:7:3,509 --> 0:7:8,179
besides his fantastic foot was an email he
got about it. It was from the NFL.

92
0:7:8,179 --> 0:7:8,179
HAVARD RUGLAND, NORWEGIAN KICKER: I`ve got
(inaudible) and things started to calm down


93
0:7:8,179 --> 0:7:8,379
a little bit, and maybe a weak or so, I got
an email from New York Jets. The email asked


94
0:7:8,379 --> 0:7:17,209
me - and told me that they liked what they
were seeing and I should contact them if I


95
0:7:17,209 --> 0:7:28,309
would be interested in the tryout with the
New York Jets. I, of course, thought, these


96
0:7:28,309 --> 0:7:35,29
were some of my friends joking around.


97
0:7:35,29 --> 0:7:37,909
(END VIDEO CLIP)


98
0:7:37,909 --> 0:7:43,219
AZUZ: But it wasn`t. So Rugland tried out
with the Jets just before Christmas. He says


99
0:7:43,219 --> 0:7:48,229
it went well and that he`s got another tryout
coming up. If he eventually makes the team,


100
0:7:48,229 --> 0:7:52,159
we`ll all get a kick out of it.


101
0:7:52,159 --> 0:7:55,699
Right on our blog over the Christmas break,
we asked what you think is the best kind of


102
0:7:55,699 --> 0:8:1,199
gift to give. Katie says, the best present
to give is love. Whether it`s your dad coming


103
0:8:1,199 --> 0:8:5,29
home from Iraq and you get to see him or simply
giving your mom a hug.


104
0:8:5,29 --> 0:8:10,139
From Kaitlin, "I think the best gift to give
or get is quality time with your family."


105
0:8:10,139 --> 0:8:14,419
Cole says "A good gift doesn`t have to be
expensive or come off a list. A legitimate


106
0:8:14,419 --> 0:8:19,439
good gift is something you put time and effort
into to make someone happy."


107
0:8:19,439 --> 0:8:24,409
Jahnavi thinks a holiday carol would brighten
people`s days. Her best friend "always sings


108
0:8:24,409 --> 0:8:28,229
"Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer," and it
makes everybody forget about their stress


109
0:8:28,229 --> 0:8:30,179
and join in with the caroling.


110
0:8:30,179 --> 0:8:34,169
From Brynn, "I think that the best to give
is happiness and joy and you could give some


111
0:8:34,169 --> 0:8:38,389
cookies to Santa and give carrots to the reindeer.
The reindeer like carrots."


112
0:8:38,389 --> 0:8:43,129
And finally, Jace says, "Our country is so
focuses on the "What will I get or what will


113
0:8:43,129 --> 0:8:47,22
I receive" and it doesn`t get the full meaning
of the holidays. That full meaning is to be


114
0:8:47,22 --> 0:8:51,44
with the family and people you care about,
not those pointless gifts.


115
0:8:51,44 --> 0:8:57,79
AZUZ: Well, before we go today, a common new
year`s resolution is to trim down a little


116
0:8:57,79 --> 0:9:3,339
bit. This wouldn`t help. It`s one Australian
shop`s way to ring in the New Year with some


117
0:9:3,339 --> 0:9:9,24
new weight. The Brobdingnagian burger bangs
the scales at 220 pounds, it weighs more than


118
0:9:9,24 --> 0:9:15,269
I do, and it`s not just chuck that`s up on
it, it`s fried eggs, bacon, it`s chickens,


119
0:9:15,269 --> 0:9:19,93
yeah, more than one. The usual stuff, too,
like lettuce, tomatoes and of course, some


120
0:9:19,93 --> 0:9:24,49
really big buns. Vegetarians might have beef
with the whole idea, and there will be plenty


121
0:9:24,49 --> 0:9:28,41
of meat to their argument. Eating too much
would leave even the carnivores grounded,


122
0:9:28,41 --> 0:9:30,8
though no one would have to ask where is the
beef?


123
0:9:30,8 --> 0:9:34,459
It`s not too rare that we cook up these many
puns on the show, though they are pretty well


124
0:9:34,459 --> 0:9:37,93
done, I have to say. We`ll be glad to stack
up more news for you tomorrow, if you let


125
0:9:37,93 --> 0:11:37,93
us. For CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m Carl Azuz.
