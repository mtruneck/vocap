###25 HAMILTON MORRIS: I've spent months reading every
###27 anthropological and ethnographic report of the
###30 Haitian Zombie, researching the pharmacology, toxicity,
###34 and biosynthesis of TTX, poring through books on occult
###38 magic, medicinal plants of the Caribbean, animal sacrifice,
###42 vodou theology, and African folklore, hoping to grasp the
###46 strange phenomenon of zombification.
###48 
###52 WADE DAVIS: You always have to investigate the belief system
###56 that mediates the pharmacological event or the
###60 pharmacological possibility.
###61 So that really led to the second phase of the
###64 investigation, what is a zombie?
###66 And the quintessential act of making a zombie
###70 is a natural act.
###74 HAMILTON MORRIS: Haiti was once one of the most valuable
###76 pieces of land in the world, exporting well over 100
###80 million pounds of sugar each year, in addition to the
###83 finest indigo, coffee, and tobacco plants with the
###87 largest leaves in the Caribbean.
###90 Today, after centuries of kleptocratic politicians and
###94 religious oppression, Haiti is the poorest country in the
###97 Western hemisphere.
###99 The city is unimaginably chaotic.
###102 The streets, alleys, and canals are littered with the
###105 skin of organic matter.
###108 Peels, husks, and shells of every imaginable food line the
###111 sides of the road, waist high, like snowbanks.
###116 The past 100 years have been especially turbulent for
###120 Haiti, including more than 10 US military interventions and
###125 an occupation from 1915 to 1934.
###131 US Marines returned home with weird tales of potions, black
###135 magic, and the living dead.
###138 They published their stories in pulp novels, which serve to
###141 inspire a series of horror movies, in doing so, sculpting
###145 the American concept of the zombie.
###149 [OMINOUS MUSIC]
###160 I arrive at my luxurious hotel.
###165 Charles Addams was a frequent guest at the Oloffson Hotel,
###169 and he used its architecture to inspire the
###171 Addams Family mansion.
###173 The Gothic gingerbread facade bursts with every sort of
###177 Victorian ornamentation imaginable--
###180 fretwork spandrels, dentate bargeboard pendants, openwork
###184 lentils, turned wood balusters, gabled dormers, and
###188 spires clad in corrugated iron.
###192 Essentially, it looks like a giant haunted doily.
###195 
###203 Each night, I sleep in the Jean-Claude Van Damme suite,
###207 named in honor of the great Belgian martial artist and
###210 star
###211 of "Time Cop." [THUNDER]
###217 
###221 I walk downstairs and meet my guide and bodyguard, Alex,
###225 who's going to take me to a vodou ceremony deep in the
###228 hills of Port-au-Prince.
###230 Hey, what's going on?
###231 ALEX LEGROS: It's a pleasure to be with you.
###234 HAMILTON MORRIS: Yes, yes.
###234 ALEX LEGROS: How's everything?
###235 HAMILTON MORRIS: Good.
###235 How are you?
###236 ALEX LEGROS: All right.
###237 HAMILTON MORRIS: He's a very large man.
###239 He tells me that he was shot in the face 14 times,
###244 twice in the eye.
###246 And it makes it difficult for him to drink alcohol.
###250 He also tells me Haiti is the only place on Earth where
###254 people can fly.
###257 What time is it that the show starts?
###260 
###262 ALEX LEGROS: It's 10 to 7:00.
###264 HAMILTON MORRIS: In Haiti, conversations vacillate
###266 between rational and utterly fantastical.
###271 WADE DAVIS: I remember the first week or so I was in
###274 Haiti, I just felt I was just blown away by the
###278 sense of the spiritual.
###279 Where did we get this idea of vodou as kind of
###282 evil or black magic?
###284 It really goes back to the fact that, if you're to name
###288 the great religions of the world, what do you say?
###290 Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism,
###292 Islam, Hinduism, whenever.
###295 There's always one continent left out.
###297 Sub-Saharan Africa.
###298 And the tacit assumption being that black
###300 people had no religion.
###301 Well of course, by ethnographic
###302 definition, they did.
###304 
###312 HAMILTON MORRIS: Vodou is much more than
###313 zombification and poisoning.
###315 In fact, these are fringe matters most priests do not
###318 concern themselves with.
###321 Tonight, we've been invited to attend a bi-yearly ceremony to
###325 celebrate Baron Samedi, the god of the graveyard.
###330 They paint sacred symbols, or veves, on the ground with
###334 powdered cornmeal.
###335 Each veve symbolizes a different Loa, or god.
###339 
###341 Each room of the peristyle has a shrine adorned with human
###345 skulls, swords, crutches, potions, and bottles of Carlo
###350 Rossi filled with the extract of 21 hot peppers.
###356 The Loa must be fed.
###358 
###363 I smoke several fat Js and begin to appreciate the power
###367 of the music even more.
###368 [DRUMMING AND SINGING]
###396 A woman straddles a child's chair, her face contorted.
###400 She's wincing and bouncing, as if the
###402 chair itself were possessed.
###404 
###408 For reasons that are slightly unclear, the Loa of love,
###412 Erzulie, asks for my hand in marriage.
###416 I'm hesitant at first.
###419 Alex informs me that if I ever have sex on a Thursday again
###423 for the rest of my life, I will be killed.
###428 I ask for a moment to consider my options, but am given no
###431 choice and accept Erzulie's hand in marriage.
###437 
###449 As an offering to the Petro Loa, a well fed sow is led
###453 into the center of the peristyle.
###455 The music stops.
###457 
###459 [SOW SQUEALING]
###470 They saw open the pig's throat with a dull knife, digging
###473 around in its neck, pulling out veins and arteries like
###476 wires from a circuit breaker, while draining its blood into
###479 a large ceramic dish.
###481 
###498 This is a sacred act, not of animosity but of love and
###504 tenderness.
###507 The pig is now an ambassador, serenely ascending into the
###511 heavens with a message for the gods.
###514 
###518 [DRUMMING AND SINGING]
###536 A man is mounted by a Loa.
###538 He fills his mouth with a cheeseburger-sized pile of
###541 burning embers and begins to wildly spit sparks with
###546 strands of black saliva dripping down his face.
###550 He eats not just a piece of coal but a three-course meal
###554 consisting entirely of burning embers.
###556 
###571 It would be a great understatement to say I am
###574 very impressed.
###575
