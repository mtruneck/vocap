###6 THOMAS MORTON: Hi, welcome to the Vice offices.
###7 As you can see, everybody here is doing a very good job
###10 looking busy.
###11 They're all at computers though, which means what
###13 they're actually doing is basically what you are doing--
###15 screwing around on the internet.
###17 I work on a computer too.
###19 I'm no stranger to YouTube links, and so I decided to put
###23 together a few of my favorites from this week.
###25 So come enjoy the cream of the crap.
###30 [SIGH]
###33 Since it's our first week together, we are forging a
###36 little bond of intimacy with us, I figured instead of doing
###39 the week's round up, I would kind of dig back into the
###41 personal archives and share with you five of my--
###44 maybe not all time favorite, but I think significant
###48 YouTube clips from my own life.
###51 Our first one is completely self-contained and
###55 self-explanatory.
###56 It's an Asian reporter going down a slide.
###60 REPORTER: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###68 [SCREAMING]
###71 THOMAS MORTON: Look, I'm not going to try to--
###75 kind of want to make that my ringtone, to be frank.
###76 The next video is what qualifies as a griefing video.
###80 It's labeled "An epic troll," which is kind of like
###84 "slander" and "libel"-- they're both more or
###85 less the same term.
###87 The audio is piped in, which makes it even funnier.
###90 And then to emphasize that, and make sure you understand
###93 exactly what swears they're sputtering,
###96 they've added text.
###98 
###105 THOMAS MORTON: As a veteran of many busted NES controllers
###110 and harsh words to my mom in other rooms, I think it's only
###116 par for the course.
###116 But it's kind of like a grunting in tennis, it helps
###120 you play better.
###121 
###127 So the deal with this kid is, I think it's like a
###130 10-year-old who has a camera, but probably also Autism.
###134 So this is just one video from this kid who has a whole page
###137 that you should subscribe to immediately, because all his
###140 videos are of--
###142 not at him, but of what he sees through the camera, and
###146 then him talking about the camera and then kind of
###149 getting angry about the camera's occasional
###152 non-functionality.
###154 
###157 CHILD (OFFSCREEN): Dang it.
###158 Can't zoom up on this camera.
###159 
###162 Wonder if all these people have ever heard of
###164 the camera I have?
###165 
###168 THOMAS MORTON: This is as a little more cerebral fare.
###171 It's a robotic birth simulator as being demonstrated by a guy
###178 who has clearly been inside a countless number of vagina's.
###185 He makes Wilt Chamberlain look like Tiny Tim, basically.
###189 MALE SPEAKER: Often junior doctors can place the first
###192 blade, but have a lot of difficulties to place the
###195 second blade.
###196 THOMAS MORTON: I cannot believe this hasn't been taken
###198 down and moved to RedTube yet.
###200 MALE SPEAKER: And the junior doctor has to go through the
###202 spheres in order to place the forceps.
###205 
###208 THOMAS MORTON: This last clip was a favorite of our British
###211 office for a while, I think because all British people are
###215 racist against every other country in Europe.
###218 It's a pool girl at--
###220 as evidenced by the bathing suits-- an Eastern European
###224 party of some sort, in the mother of all k-holes.
