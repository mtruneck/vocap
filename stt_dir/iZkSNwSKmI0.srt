CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: You`ve probably been
to a museum, but you probably didn`t need


2
0:0:3,88 --> 0:0:9,15
scuba gear to get there. That`s one of the
stories we are diving into today on CNN STUDENT


3
0:0:9,15 --> 0:0:24,48
NEWS. I`m Carl Azuz.


4
0:0:24,48 --> 0:0:28,21
First up, we are looking at President Obama`s
first news conference since he was reelected


5
0:0:28,21 --> 0:0:32,87
to a second term. The president took questions
from the media for about an hour at the White


6
0:0:32,87 --> 0:0:38,59
House yesterday afternoon. One topic that
came up, the so-called "fiscal cliff". It`s


7
0:0:38,59 --> 0:0:43,1
a set of spending cuts and tax increases that
could go into effect soon. The president and


8
0:0:43,1 --> 0:0:47,76
congressional leaders are considering ways
to avoid that cliff. President Obama was set


9
0:0:47,76 --> 0:0:52,219
to meet with business leaders after yesterday`s
news conference to talk about the issue. He


10
0:0:52,219 --> 0:0:54,219
said he wants input from everyone.


11
0:0:54,219 --> 0:0:55,91

12
0:0:55,91 --> 0:1:0,329
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: I`m open to new ideas, if Republican


13
0:1:0,329 --> 0:1:7,979
counterparts or some Democrats have a great
idea for us to raise revenue, maintain progress,


14
0:1:7,979 --> 0:1:15,57
make sure the middle class isn`t getting hit,
reduces our deficit, encourages growth, I`m


15
0:1:15,57 --> 0:1:21,63
not going to just slam the door in their face.
I want to hear idea - I want to hear ideas


16
0:1:21,63 --> 0:1:21,92
from everybody.


17
0:1:21,92 --> 0:1:22,259
(END VIDEO CLIP)


18
0:1:22,259 --> 0:1:25,64
AZUZ: We are going to leave Washington now
and head over to the Middle East, specifically


19
0:1:25,64 --> 0:1:31,25
Gaza, one of the territories at the center
of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.


20
0:1:31,25 --> 0:1:35,299
The violence between those two groups has
been increasing recently. Yesterday, Israel


21
0:1:35,299 --> 0:1:39,81
launched air strikes against what it said
were terrorists targets. Palestinian officials


22
0:1:39,81 --> 0:1:44,75
said there were at least 35 strikes in an
eight-hour span of time. At least nine people


23
0:1:44,75 --> 0:1:49,799
were killed in the air strikes, and that includes
the leader of the military wing of Hamas,


24
0:1:49,799 --> 0:1:54,5
that group controls the Palestinian government
and the U.S. classifies it as the terrorist


25
0:1:54,5 --> 0:1:55,82
organization.


26
0:1:55,82 --> 0:2:0,75
Israel said its air strikes were a response
to increased rocket attacks from Gaza. One


27
0:2:0,75 --> 0:2:5,899
of those rockets hit a shopping center in
southern Israel yesterday. Both sides, Israel


28
0:2:5,899 --> 0:2:10,179
and Hamas, say they are defending themselves
against attacks from the other side.


29
0:2:10,179 --> 0:2:14,56
Finally, we are going to head all the way
over to Australia. Some people made their


30
0:2:14,56 --> 0:2:19,93
way to the northeastern part of the country
this week, and they went there to see this:


31
0:2:19,93 --> 0:2:24,8
a total solar eclipse that was visible over
Australia`s northern territories. According


32
0:2:24,8 --> 0:2:29,98
to NASA, this kind of thing happens on average
about every 18 months. But that`s in different


33
0:2:29,98 --> 0:2:35,6
spots around the world. This parts of Australia
might not see another full solar eclipse for


34
0:2:35,6 --> 0:2:41,29
375 years. So, what exactly is going on in
a solar eclipse? It has to do with orbits


35
0:2:41,29 --> 0:2:46,599
and shadows. Solar eclipse happens when the
Moon, while it`s orbiting the Earth, passes


36
0:2:46,599 --> 0:2:51,4
directly in front of the Sun. That casts a
shadow on the Earth surface. In the outer


37
0:2:51,4 --> 0:2:56,599
part of that shadow, the penumbra, part of
the Sun, is blocked. In the inner part, the


38
0:2:56,599 --> 0:2:59,489
umbra, that`s where the eclipse is total.


39
0:2:59,489 --> 0:3:0,879

40
0:3:0,879 --> 0:3:6,25
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today "Shoutout" goes
out to Ms. Chapman`s English class at Daniel


41
0:3:6,25 --> 0:3:12,47
J. Savage Middle School in Modesto, California.
Newton`s first law, which says an object in


42
0:3:12,47 --> 0:3:19,209
motion will stay in motion unless acted on
by an outside force, describes what concept?


43
0:3:19,209 --> 0:3:29,86
Is it inertia, gravity, acceleration or thermodynamics?
You`ve got three seconds, go!


44
0:3:29,86 --> 0:3:37,79
Newton`s first law of motion is sometimes
known as a law of inertia. That`s your answer


45
0:3:37,79 --> 0:3:40,75
and that`s your "Shoutout."


46
0:3:40,75 --> 0:3:43,72
(END VIDEO CLIP)


47
0:3:43,72 --> 0:3:48,25
AZUZ: An everyday example of inertia: you
are driving a car down the street, and another


48
0:3:48,25 --> 0:3:53,11
one stopped in front of you. Your car will
stay in motion unless an outside force stops


49
0:3:53,11 --> 0:3:57,269
it, so either a break or the other car. Now,
there is some new technology out that could


50
0:3:57,269 --> 0:4:2,47
help avoid the accident. The National Transportation
Safety Board says this new technology should


51
0:4:2,47 --> 0:4:8,99
be required on all vehicles. It could help
prevent some accidents, it could also drive


52
0:4:8,99 --> 0:4:12,489
up the cost of a car. Sandra Endo now takes
a look at how this technology works.


53
0:4:12,489 --> 0:4:13,0
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


54
0:4:13,0 --> 0:4:17,15
SANDRA ENDO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is what
federal safety officials want to avoid.


55
0:4:17,15 --> 0:4:20,8
Oh my gosh! Ah!


56
0:4:20,8 --> 0:4:26,1
A new technology could help. I got behind
the wheel at the Insurance Institute for Highway


57
0:4:26,1 --> 0:4:32,69
Safety to see how collision avoiding systems
work. This car automatically brakes when it


58
0:4:32,69 --> 0:4:35,72
comes too close to the car in front.


59
0:4:35,72 --> 0:4:40,36
Wow! That is freaky! And it completely braked
on its own.


60
0:4:40,36 --> 0:4:42,12
DAVID ZUBY, INSURANCE INSTITUTE OF HIGHWAY
SAFETY: It prevented a crash.


61
0:4:42,12 --> 0:4:47,5
ENDO: The sensors and cameras installed in
the vehicle can detect more than just cars:


62
0:4:47,5 --> 0:4:50,28
at a faster speed, watch what happens.


63
0:4:50,28 --> 0:4:53,26
ZUBY: And a pedestrian out in front of us.


64
0:4:53,26 --> 0:4:56,68
ENDO: Oh my gosh! A! Oh my gosh! I hit him!


65
0:4:56,68 --> 0:4:57,17
ZUBY: You hit him!


66
0:4:57,17 --> 0:4:57,54
ENDO: Oh no!


67
0:4:57,54 --> 0:5:0,22
ZUBY: But not too hard. He probably just fell
over.


68
0:5:0,22 --> 0:5:0,59
ENDO: Oh, I didn`t.


69
0:5:0,59 --> 0:5:3,98
ZUBY: And at a higher speed, we wouldn`t -- we
wouldn`t avoid the crash, and that would be


70
0:5:3,98 --> 0:5:7,79
a crash, but because of the braking, the crash
would be at the lower speed then it would


71
0:5:7,79 --> 0:5:8,92
be without the system.


72
0:5:8,92 --> 0:5:13,74
ENDO: The National Transportation Safety Board
Wednesday added collision avoidance technology


73
0:5:13,74 --> 0:5:19,7
to its list of most wanted safety improvements.
It wants states to mandate these systems,


74
0:5:19,7 --> 0:5:22,83
now available in luxury cars in all cars.


75
0:5:22,83 --> 0:5:25,53
DEBORAH HERSMAN, NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY
BOARD: We know that hundreds of lives can


76
0:5:25,53 --> 0:5:30,95
be saved, and hundreds of thousands of injuries
can be prevented if the technology improves


77
0:5:30,95 --> 0:5:37,63
and you can avoid these runoff the road, rear
end and also the side departure, the lane


78
0:5:37,63 --> 0:5:38,8
departure collisions.


79
0:5:38,8 --> 0:5:44,54
ENDO: Other safety systems on the market include
blind spot indicators, directional headlights


80
0:5:44,54 --> 0:5:50,18
and an alert when a driver drifts out of the
lane. The insurance institute says, the automatic


81
0:5:50,18 --> 0:5:56,28
breaking system is effective. The lane departure
warning system hurts rather than helps. But


82
0:5:56,28 --> 0:5:57,26
it`s unclear, why.


83
0:5:57,26 --> 0:6:3,63
ZUBY: They don`t seem in this earlier data
to be preventing crashes, which is a disappointment.


84
0:6:3,63 --> 0:6:7,71
Transportation safety officials say, once
the kinks are worked out, the technology could


85
0:6:7,71 --> 0:6:12,26
further reduce the number of fatalities, which
has been decreasing from year to year.


86
0:6:12,26 --> 0:6:12,7
ENDO: Oh my gosh!


87
0:6:12,7 --> 0:6:16,15
Despite the increasing number of drivers on
the road.


88
0:6:16,15 --> 0:6:18,17
ENDO: Wow! That was scary!

91
0:6:20,19 --> 0:6:26,23
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? Coral
is an example of an igneous rock.


92
0:6:26,23 --> 0:6:32,65
No, in fact, it`s not a rock at all. Coral
is alive and it`s a type of animal.


93
0:6:32,65 --> 0:6:35,62
(END VIDEO CLIP)


94
0:6:35,62 --> 0:6:41,13
AZUZ: Coral is a living species, it`s also
an endangered species. And a museum near Cancun,


95
0:6:41,13 --> 0:6:46,38
Mexico is trying to help out in a couple of
ways: The art work is designed to help develop


96
0:6:46,38 --> 0:6:51,25
new coral: and the artist who created it is
hoping his design will pull some of the attention


97
0:6:51,25 --> 0:6:56,19
away from existing coral, to kind of give
those reefs a rest. Nick Parker has more on


98
0:6:56,19 --> 0:6:59,1
a green project beneath the dip blue sea.


99
0:6:59,1 --> 0:7:0,11
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


100
0:7:0,11 --> 0:7:5,27
NICK PARKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Welcome. To
an underwater world and mysterious figures


101
0:7:5,27 --> 0:7:7,94
frozen in time.


102
0:7:7,94 --> 0:7:13,79
This unique museum off the coast of Cancun
has nearly 500 sculptures sunken in up to


103
0:7:13,79 --> 0:7:15,71
ten meters of water.


104
0:7:15,71 --> 0:7:21,61
A growing tourists attraction, it`s also a
vital frontline in conservation as it diverts


105
0:7:21,61 --> 0:7:25,22
divers from Mexico`s fragile coral reefs.


106
0:7:25,22 --> 0:7:31,45
It`s a labor of love for British artist Jason
De Caires Taylor who began the project in


107
0:7:31,45 --> 0:7:31,78
2009.


108
0:7:31,78 --> 0:7:35,59
JASON DE CAIRES TAYLOR, SCULPTOR: I was a
diver, and I`ve been diving around the world


109
0:7:35,59 --> 0:7:40,29
in various places, so I had this vision that
I always wanted to create this underwater


110
0:7:40,29 --> 0:7:44,31
sort of seascape, and I was also looking into
the conservation element of it that it could


111
0:7:44,31 --> 0:7:48,8
be used to create an artificial reef, started
off like a pilot project in Grenada. It started


112
0:7:48,8 --> 0:7:52,24
off quite small, we just had a few pieces,
and slowly grew.


113
0:7:52,24 --> 0:7:57,22
PARKER: The project called "the eye" of Cancun`s
Marine Park officials who were trying to restore


114
0:7:57,22 --> 0:8:1,1
the region`s reefs damaged by 2005`s Hurricane
Wilma.


115
0:8:1,1 --> 0:8:5,42
JAIME GONZALEZ, NATIONAL MARINE PARK: And
we thought that by implementing this project,


116
0:8:5,42 --> 0:8:7,98
will become an icon for Cancun.


117
0:8:7,98 --> 0:8:12,37
PARKER: Taylor has staggered the deployment
of the statues over a few years, so there


118
0:8:12,37 --> 0:8:14,76
are some that cleaner than others.


119
0:8:14,76 --> 0:8:22,87
The visual evidence of nature gradually taking
over, he has titled "silent evolution." Crucially,


120
0:8:22,87 --> 0:8:28,53
the statues are made from a ph-neutral material
to attract fish and coral. And the cement


121
0:8:28,53 --> 0:8:31,17
is high grade, to withstand strong currents.


122
0:8:31,17 --> 0:8:36,2
TAYLOR: The world`s coral reefs are facing
extreme pressures from all sides. Issues to


123
0:8:36,2 --> 0:8:40,32
do with water quality and global warming are,
you know, some of the biggest problems. This


124
0:8:40,32 --> 0:8:44,7
project, obviously, can`t combat that. But
what it kind of help to do is raise some awareness


125
0:8:44,7 --> 0:8:48,88
about the state of our reefs and draw people`s
attention, to, you know, the underwater scene.


126
0:8:48,88 --> 0:8:49,38
(END VIDEOTAPE)


127
0:8:49,38 --> 0:8:55,3
AZUZ: All right, we are going to wrap things
up today with a little museum matchup. Guess,


128
0:8:55,3 --> 0:8:59,13
which one is real, and which one`s a work
of art. OK, it`s easy to tell them apart.


129
0:8:59,13 --> 0:9:3,61
They do look eerily alike, even this guy`s
girlfriend was a little freaked out by the


130
0:9:3,61 --> 0:9:7,35
resemblance when she ran across this painting
during a visit to a museum.


131
0:9:7,35 --> 0:9:8,2
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


132
0:9:8,2 --> 0:9:11,89
NIKKIE CURTIS, MAX GALUPPO`S GIRLFRIEND: I`m
giggling like crazy, and it`s dead silent


133
0:9:11,89 --> 0:9:13,0
in those museums -- and I go, do you see this
guy?


134
0:9:13,0 --> 0:9:17,64
MAX GALUPPPO: I`ll be honest, at first I didn`t
-- I didn`t think it looked like me.


135
0:9:17,64 --> 0:9:21,71
I feel goof for 450 -- I`ve got to-- I`ve
got to admit.


136
0:9:21,71 --> 0:9:22,94
(END VIDEO CLIP)


137
0:9:22,94 --> 0:9:25,78
AZUZ: The painting was made 450 years ago,
I guess when you are waiting for your long


138
0:9:25,78 --> 0:9:30,12
last twin to show up, you have a lot of time
to just hang around. And while the guy might


139
0:9:30,12 --> 0:9:34,5
have tried to brush off the resemblance at
first, eventually, he had to come to grips


140
0:9:34,5 --> 0:9:37,7
with the art truth. Of course, the whole thing
has gone viral. So, if he was looking for


141
0:9:37,7 --> 0:9:41,88
a little online attention, this is a big twin.
And while sometimes it`s difficult to come


142
0:9:41,88 --> 0:9:45,96
up with the pans at the end of show, with
art stories, they just come easily.


143
0:9:45,96 --> 0:11:45,96
That`s all for CNN STUDENT NEWS. I hope you`ll
paint us back into your schedule on Friday.
