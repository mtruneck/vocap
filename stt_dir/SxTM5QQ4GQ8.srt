0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:34,48



2
0:0:34,48 --> 0:0:37,11
HARVEY FOSTER: I liked pulling
into that bowl and just being


3
0:0:37,11 --> 0:0:39,84
like, what there's a
skatable bowl here?


4
0:0:39,84 --> 0:0:41,3
Where are we?


5
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:42,665
Is there electricity here?


6
0:0:42,665 --> 0:0:57,13



7
0:0:57,13 --> 0:0:58,962
-No, I've done it twice.


8
0:0:58,962 --> 0:1:1,854
-I just smoked weed.


9
0:1:1,854 --> 0:1:3,782
-I've dranken six beers.


10
0:1:3,782 --> 0:1:6,51



11
0:1:6,51 --> 0:1:8,53
-It's only day one
of the trip.


12
0:1:8,53 --> 0:1:11,0
If it was like day 9 and we
were closer to San Diego.


13
0:1:11,0 --> 0:1:13,546
Will you get that Medevac
thing out?


14
0:1:13,546 --> 0:1:15,21
[LAUGHTER]


15
0:1:15,21 --> 0:1:17,62
-Right?


16
0:1:17,62 --> 0:1:19,21
HARVEY FOSTER: I like all
the contrasts, man.


17
0:1:19,21 --> 0:1:22,33



18
0:1:22,33 --> 0:1:24,92
Mexico's really laid back.


19
0:1:24,92 --> 0:1:29,28
And beer's cheap, and the
smokes are cheap.


20
0:1:29,28 --> 0:1:32,93
And there's no pretty girls
anywhere, so I'm not getting


21
0:1:32,93 --> 0:1:36,788
trouble with my woman.


22
0:1:36,788 --> 0:1:39,8
That's good.


23
0:1:39,8 --> 0:1:42,61
-You just want an excuse to hack
shit up with a big knife.


24
0:1:42,61 --> 0:1:43,86
Toss it in.


25
0:1:43,86 --> 0:1:49,54



26
0:1:49,54 --> 0:1:51,5
HARVEY FOSTER: Mexico's
fucking sweet.


27
0:1:51,5 --> 0:1:52,97
[LAUGHTER]


28
0:1:52,97 --> 0:1:57,76



29
0:1:57,76 --> 0:1:59,77
HIME HERBERT: Found an old
church, that was kind of cool,


30
0:1:59,77 --> 0:2:3,32
climbed around in it,
and then came back


31
0:2:3,32 --> 0:2:5,934
later, and blew it up.


32
0:2:5,934 --> 0:2:7,38
[EXPLOSION]


33
0:2:7,38 --> 0:2:11,73



34
0:2:11,73 --> 0:2:16,46
KYNAN TAIT: I don't know where
we got them from, but someone


35
0:2:16,46 --> 0:2:20,62
had a big bag of apple bombs
and little firecrackers,


36
0:2:20,62 --> 0:2:23,2
little bombs or whatever, and
we just threw them in the


37
0:2:23,2 --> 0:2:26,484
little empty cement
box out back.


38
0:2:26,484 --> 0:2:28,894
HIME HERBERT: Dude,
I felt that shit.


39
0:2:28,894 --> 0:2:30,144
[LAUGHTER]


40
0:2:30,144 --> 0:2:36,94



41
0:2:36,94 --> 0:2:38,19
[INAUDIBLE]


42
0:2:38,19 --> 0:2:44,31



43
0:2:44,31 --> 0:2:47,58
-This is Harvey with
both hands--


44
0:2:47,58 --> 0:2:49,212
-This is Harvey with
ten fingers.


45
0:2:49,212 --> 0:2:52,516
HARVEY FOSTER: Don't say that.


46
0:2:52,516 --> 0:2:54,876
HIME HERBERT: Son of a bitch.


47
0:2:54,876 --> 0:2:56,33
[EXPLOSION]


48
0:2:56,33 --> 0:2:58,15
HARVEY FOSTER: Whoa, that
was the best one.


49
0:2:58,15 --> 0:3:6,5



50
0:3:6,5 --> 0:3:7,75
HIME HERBERT: No mas.


51
0:3:7,75 --> 0:3:41,565



52
0:3:41,565 --> 0:3:43,38
-The dirt bike guy,
I have no idea.


53
0:3:43,38 --> 0:3:45,506
That dude was a wingnut,
guaranteed.


54
0:3:45,506 --> 0:3:50,13



55
0:3:50,13 --> 0:3:52,38
Everything was pioneered by
offroad racers and surfers


56
0:3:52,38 --> 0:3:55,41
down here, as far as good
spots to go to.


57
0:3:55,41 --> 0:3:57,1
Everybody's running from
something, whether it's


58
0:3:57,1 --> 0:4:1,61
running from a 40 hour a week
job, or responsibilities, or


59
0:4:1,61 --> 0:4:3,6
just tired of the rat race.


60
0:4:3,6 --> 0:4:5,86
And I think they come down here
and just get turned on by


61
0:4:5,86 --> 0:4:6,72
the freedom.


62
0:4:6,72 --> 0:4:10,31
And they want to come down and
not pay a bunch of taxes, and


63
0:4:10,31 --> 0:4:12,54
live somewhere where they
can sort of do what they


64
0:4:12,54 --> 0:4:15,27
want and check out.


65
0:4:15,27 --> 0:4:15,77
RICHARD STEVENS: I've
been living in


66
0:4:15,77 --> 0:4:18,1
here, now, for 30 years.


67
0:4:18,1 --> 0:4:22,15
Back in 1980 I came down here
with a lot of friends, come


68
0:4:22,15 --> 0:4:24,98
down here surfing all the time,
and ended up with an


69
0:4:24,98 --> 0:4:27,44
opportunity to buy a piece
of property down here.


70
0:4:27,44 --> 0:4:31,8
And I had a lot of friends in
construction, so we nabbed a


71
0:4:31,8 --> 0:4:34,56
bunch of wood and stuff from
the job sides and came down


72
0:4:34,56 --> 0:4:36,24
here, saved our money
up, and I started


73
0:4:36,24 --> 0:4:37,73
building a little spot.


74
0:4:37,73 --> 0:4:40,52
And that's how, really,
Quatro Casas as a


75
0:4:40,52 --> 0:4:41,57
service community started.


76
0:4:41,57 --> 0:4:44,56
Because I was the first person
to come out here and make it a


77
0:4:44,56 --> 0:4:45,81
place to live, you know.


78
0:4:45,81 --> 0:4:49,5



79
0:4:49,5 --> 0:4:51,66
If you ever come to Mexico,
don't worry, there's


80
0:4:51,66 --> 0:4:52,57
no danger out here.


81
0:4:52,57 --> 0:4:55,72
We're far away from all the
city and all the trouble.


82
0:4:55,72 --> 0:4:58,78



83
0:4:58,78 --> 0:5:1,31
This place is famous for its
wave because its real long.


84
0:5:1,31 --> 0:5:4,46
And we get that off South swell,
so when the Antartic


85
0:5:4,46 --> 0:5:6,31
starts to go into its winter--


86
0:5:6,31 --> 0:5:7,56
drop it!


87
0:5:7,56 --> 0:5:9,5



88
0:5:9,5 --> 0:5:11,4
These guys are burning
themselves.


89
0:5:11,4 --> 0:5:11,85
-Straight up.


90
0:5:11,85 --> 0:5:13,48
You straight [INAUDIBLE].


91
0:5:13,48 --> 0:5:16,7
-They are fucked up.


92
0:5:16,7 --> 0:5:17,68
-Howdy.


93
0:5:17,68 --> 0:5:19,15
[LAUGHTER]


94
0:5:19,15 --> 0:5:28,41



95
0:5:28,41 --> 0:5:30,84
-Nice.


96
0:5:30,84 --> 0:5:33,17
RICHARD STEVENS: Hey, fire it
that way because, otherwise,


97
0:5:33,17 --> 0:5:36,6
if it hits those solar panels,
it's going to be problems.


98
0:5:36,6 --> 0:5:37,54
[LAUGHTER]


99
0:5:37,54 --> 0:5:38,99
-That's a proper cannon.


100
0:5:38,99 --> 0:5:52,704



101
0:5:52,704 --> 0:5:55,97
ARTO SAARI: Burning wood,
chopping fucking shit with an


102
0:5:55,97 --> 0:5:59,135
axe, is, fucking
pretty awesome.


103
0:5:59,135 --> 0:6:3,52
a fire, to me, is like
watching TV.


104
0:6:3,52 --> 0:6:4,28
I love fire.


105
0:6:4,28 --> 0:6:5,82
I like burning things down.


106
0:6:5,82 --> 0:6:10,17
And I think it's just in my
blood, mostly, I think.


107
0:6:10,17 --> 0:6:12,67
HARVEY FOSTER: Yeah, because
he's, like, from Finland.


108
0:6:12,67 --> 0:6:15,39
And I was in Sweden before, and
I know they're all, like,


109
0:6:15,39 --> 0:6:17,21
outdoorsy people.


110
0:6:17,21 --> 0:6:21,1
And then I heard he had the
nickname of Norseman of the


111
0:6:21,1 --> 0:6:22,35
woods or something.


112
0:6:22,35 --> 0:6:25,82



113
0:6:25,82 --> 0:6:28,615
KYNAN TAIT: Well, he was kind
of like another guy that I'd


114
0:6:28,615 --> 0:6:30,13
seen in skate videos since
I really young.


115
0:6:30,13 --> 0:6:36,16
You know, all these pretty epic
skate videos for years,


116
0:6:36,16 --> 0:6:38,5
since I was a little kid.


117
0:6:38,5 --> 0:6:40,42
Well, he's a lot bigger in
person, so he seems just like


118
0:6:40,42 --> 0:6:44,75
a woodsman to me because I
haven't really even seen him


119
0:6:44,75 --> 0:6:46,6
skate that much since we've
been on the trip.


120
0:6:46,6 --> 0:6:50,1



121
0:6:50,1 --> 0:6:51,94
ARTO SAARI: What [INAUDIBLE]?


122
0:6:51,94 --> 0:6:53,63
KYNAN TAIT: Like, as much as I
love skating, I don't want to


123
0:6:53,63 --> 0:6:55,68
hear about it 24/7.


124
0:6:55,68 --> 0:6:59,86
So I think I get along better
with like minded people who


125
0:6:59,86 --> 0:7:4,13
like skating but don't want
to talk about it, really.


126
0:7:4,13 --> 0:7:7,556
So it's been easy getting
along with him.


127
0:7:7,556 --> 0:7:10,348
-That's what she said
nine months later.


128
0:7:10,348 --> 0:7:13,49



129
0:7:13,49 --> 0:7:14,15
HARVEY FOSTER: You should
throw it on.


130
0:7:14,15 --> 0:7:16,18
You did it.


131
0:7:16,18 --> 0:7:17,14
-That was team effort.


132
0:7:17,14 --> 0:7:21,13
HARVEY FOSTER: Oh, OK, I just
had the torch passed to me.


133
0:7:21,13 --> 0:7:24,252



134
0:7:24,252 --> 0:7:26,72
ARTO SAARI: When we got to
Quatro Casas, just that,


135
0:7:26,72 --> 0:7:29,717
whatever, San Diego to
Quatro Casas, what


136
0:7:29,717 --> 0:7:32,46
was that, 150 miles?


137
0:7:32,46 --> 0:7:35,2
For those two days that we spent
there, I couldn't even


138
0:7:35,2 --> 0:7:36,52
think about skating.


139
0:7:36,52 --> 0:7:42,7
My ass piece was so
just, mm, tense.


140
0:7:42,7 --> 0:7:42,43
[INAUDIBLE]


141
0:7:42,43 --> 0:7:43,98
I was just like, can't
get my legs moving.


142
0:7:43,98 --> 0:7:45,824
I haven't ridden a bike
for a year before I


143
0:7:45,824 --> 0:7:47,74
came on this trip.


144
0:7:47,74 --> 0:8:3,52



145
0:8:3,52 --> 0:8:5,37
RICHARD STEVENS: I know a whole
group of skaters that


146
0:8:5,37 --> 0:8:6,29
come from San Diego.


147
0:8:6,29 --> 0:8:9,44
They all come down on their
hogs, skateboards tied on the


148
0:8:9,44 --> 0:8:10,97
back, hell yeah.


149
0:8:10,97 --> 0:8:14,74



150
0:8:14,74 --> 0:8:16,3
RICHARD STEVENS: Everybody has
a lot of dogs out here.


151
0:8:16,3 --> 0:8:19,2
You've got to have them
for protection.


152
0:8:19,2 --> 0:8:20,34
They don't live long.


153
0:8:20,34 --> 0:8:20,835
-No?


154
0:8:20,835 --> 0:8:22,23
RICHARD STEVENS: Not out
here in the wild,


155
0:8:22,23 --> 0:8:23,96
no, shit kill them--


156
0:8:23,96 --> 0:8:29,96
other dogs, coyotes, raccons,
bobcats, they just get-- yeah,


157
0:8:29,96 --> 0:8:30,695
they just disappear.


158
0:8:30,695 --> 0:8:32,85
I don't see them again.


159
0:8:32,85 --> 0:8:35,4
They all have disease names,
even the cats.


160
0:8:35,4 --> 0:8:37,929
There's Measles, and her three
kids, which is Valium,


161
0:8:37,929 --> 0:8:41,715
Vicodin, and Viagra, the
three orange ones.


162
0:8:41,715 --> 0:8:48,7
And then there's Ebola and
gods, what's the one that


163
0:8:48,7 --> 0:8:51,1
looks like her, I forget
her name--


164
0:8:51,1 --> 0:8:52,38
pneumonia, that's it.


165
0:8:52,38 --> 0:8:55,1
Pneumonia, and then
there's Raunches.


166
0:8:55,1 --> 0:8:57,33
Raunches means hives.


167
0:8:57,33 --> 0:8:58,25
I've run out of names.


168
0:8:58,25 --> 0:8:59,47
I've got to think
of new names.


169
0:8:59,47 --> 0:9:2,88
And I don't like to give the
same name to an animal, so--


170
0:9:2,88 --> 0:9:4,81
-Sexual diseases.


171
0:9:4,81 --> 0:9:6,874
RICHARD STEVENS: Giving
me new names.


172
0:9:6,874 --> 0:9:8,48
You guys have a good
night, and I'll


173
0:9:8,48 --> 0:9:9,742
see you in the morning.


174
0:9:9,742 --> 0:9:11,8
All right?


175
0:9:11,8 --> 0:9:12,258
All right, guys.


176
0:9:12,258 --> 0:9:14,51



177
0:9:14,51 --> 0:9:16,23
-I think people get psyched
any time they


178
0:9:16,23 --> 0:9:18,18
see a pack of bikers.


179
0:9:18,18 --> 0:9:20,6
In the middle of nowhere, on
like the long stretches of


180
0:9:20,6 --> 0:9:20,98
highways or whatever.


181
0:9:20,98 --> 0:9:23,27
People there are just like--


182
0:9:23,27 --> 0:9:23,65
-Fuck yeah.


183
0:9:23,65 --> 0:9:25,65
People are like, they're
going somewhere,


184
0:9:25,65 --> 0:9:28,43
they're doing things.


185
0:9:28,43 --> 0:9:31,894
-You can see people looking
at us on the road.


186
0:9:31,894 --> 0:9:35,86
-Yeah, I think when there's
multiple of you.


187
0:9:35,86 --> 0:9:38,1
MATT FRICK: I secretly--


188
0:9:38,1 --> 0:9:39,6
-You're curious.


189
0:9:39,6 --> 0:9:40,16
You're motorcycle curious.


190
0:9:40,16 --> 0:9:42,53
RICHARD STEVENS: I'm very
motorcycle curious.


191
0:9:42,53 --> 0:9:44,0
-You just need to
let yourself go.


192
0:9:44,0 --> 0:9:46,77
RICHARD STEVENS: I look at
motorcycles at the same time I


193
0:9:46,77 --> 0:9:48,53
masturbate.


194
0:9:48,53 --> 0:9:50,81
This is a whole thing.


195
0:9:50,81 --> 0:9:53,8
-I'm not sure what that means.


196
0:9:53,8 --> 0:9:55,69
Let's go ahead and make sure
you mark that section.


197
0:9:55,69 --> 0:9:56,76
-In private, in private.


198
0:9:56,76 --> 0:9:58,335
-There is a camera here.


199
0:9:58,335 --> 0:10:0,862



200
0:10:0,862 --> 0:10:2,74
MATT FRICK: In private.


201
0:10:2,74 --> 0:10:4,7
I look at these motocrycles
in private.


202
0:10:4,7 --> 0:10:5,9
And I'm like, god damn
it, I know what.


203
0:10:5,9 --> 0:10:6,466
I know what I want.


204
0:10:6,466 --> 0:10:8,255
I know exactly what I want.


205
0:10:8,255 --> 0:10:10,741
And I've just got to pull
the trigger, and


206
0:10:10,741 --> 0:10:12,154
I've got to do it.


207
0:10:12,154 --> 0:10:13,1
And I just--


208
0:10:13,1 --> 0:10:13,86
[LAUGHTER]


209
0:10:13,86 --> 0:10:15,39
