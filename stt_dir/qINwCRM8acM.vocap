###31 There are many stories in the history of our world.
###36 Most are lost,
###38 scattered in the winds of Time,
###43 beyond the memory of man.
###47 But this story.
###49 our story
###50 should not be forgotten.
###64 Papa!
###76 Maia!
###79 Run! Maia run. Maia run!
###106 We came from the water,
###109 It runs through our ancient days,
###113 down the long years to this moment
###117 coursing through our lives
###118 like the bloodline of Kings
###121 A swiftly flowing stream
###124 of memory and sorrow
###130 One drop of water
###132 of blood
###134 and then another
###137 can become a ripple,
###140 a river,
###141 a rising torrent
###144 unstoppable
###146 which in time
###148 breaks down all resistance
###151 to flow free once again
###153 on the journey to it's destiny
###158 The remnant of the faithful
###161 The Dúnedain
###162 the men of the West
###165 were scattered and few
###169 and beset by many dangers
###174 For the Dark Lord Sauron
###176 had not forgotten the past
###179 and of all the peoples of Middle-earth
###182 he held none with more hatred
###187 and more fear
###188 than the Dúnedain
###191 He spread his will amongst his servants
###194 and through the long years
###196 sought ever to discover if the Heirs of Isildur yet lived
###201 so that he might destroy them
###204 and the last of his greatest enemies
###207 would be lost
###209 forever
###230 Hurry!  Hurry!
###235 Dírhael!
###243 Ivorwen!  Gilraen!  Go!  Please!
###247 I will not lose you all this day.
###344 Arathorn!
###372 You have my thanks sir,
###374 and whatever service I and my family may provide you and yours.
###378 We owe you our lives.
###381 As I owe you mine. I thank you, lady.
###384 You are most welcome, my lord.
###388 We cannot stay here.  Where were you bound?
###392 I do not know, my lord.
###394 Orcs burned our village, and slew our people.
###398 Those who were not killed were scattered, I know not where.
###402 Dorlad, my son.
###404 Struck down as he defended us.
###407 We would not leave his body for the cruel sport of orcs.
###411 Your son shall have a safe resting place, lady.
###413 You will come with us.
###415 Arathorn!
###420 Arathorn?
###424 You know him, father?
###425 Yes
###427 Or I did when he was but a child.
###430 If he is the same man,
###432 he is the son of my friend and kinsman.
###435 Our chieftain, Lord Arador.
###437 Isildur's Heir.
###441 What is it?
###442 They're after plunder, it seems.
###446 But these are but baubles.
###449 It is strange.
###450 Orcs seeking gold and jewels in the Wild?
###454 to what purpose?
###462 You're becoming more like him by the day.
###465 Is that what he would have wanted?
###468 He would have growled at me for letting you take his place.
###474 "The wild is no place for my daughter!"
###478 But I'm still glad I trained you.
###482 So am I.
###483 Lord Arathorn
###494 They'll bring no news to whoever leads them.
###496 Good work Halbaron.
###498 Now we must bring these three to safety.
###505 We go to Taurdal, our village, Lord?
###508 Dírhael.
###509 My wife, Ivorwen.  And my daughter...
###512 Gilraen.
###514 And I am Arathorn.
###516 Son of Arador.
###519 Indeed.
###521 No, no.  Do not bow.
###523 When you come to my father,
###524 you may greet him thus.
###526 But for now,
###527 we must make haste.
###538 A jealous heart finds no room for true affection,
###542 though it were standing right behind it.
###546 What have I to be jealous about?
###549 I saw that look between them.
###551 Just as you did.
###554 Your eyes deceive you.
###556 Besides, it has nothing to do with me.
###558 Does it not?
###560 No!
###561 Nor with you, Dírhaborn.
###569 And so Arathorn and his rangers led the grieving family North,
###575 past the mighty rivers
###578 and through the vast forests of Rhudaur.
###582 A land that still enjoyed the watchful eye of the Dúnedain
###587 and brought them to his father, Lord Arador,
###593 in the hidden settlement of Taurdal.
###603 Come, my old friend and kinsman.
###616 Let us bestow upon your son the peace and honour he has earned.
###620 For I account your loss as my loss,
###623 and your grief as my own.
###660 Alas, no long sleep in ancient halls of stone
###666 for a son of the House of Aranarth!
###672 But I will not see your bones dishonoured, Dorlad,
###675 when the servants of Evil try again
###678 to drive the Dúnedain farther into exile!
###683 Farewell!
###754 I've come to ask your forgiveness.
###759 Long had I thought your feelings for Arathorn
###763 no more than a passing fancy
###767 and that in time you would turn from them
###771 and look around you at last.
###777 I did not understand.
###782 Until last night.
###787 Years I have spent by his side,
###789 yet there is a gulf between us
###792 that only the flames of a stranger's pyre could reveal.
###798 I cannot vie with such beauty and such sorrow.
###803 El, any man would be honoured to call you his.
###814 I would cause him nothing but grief.
###873 We found these after the attack yesterday.
###881 It is strange how such tiny things
###885 can bring such immense darkness
###888 and change into our lives.
###891 Lord Arador now had much to contemplate.
###895 News of orcs assailing other villages came to his ears.
###901 Peaceful homesteads, far from help,
###905 were likewise menaced,
###908 Taurdal filled as many of the Dúnedain fled their homes
###913 and sought safety in numbers.
###916 And so Arador led his brave rangers
###920 in a quest to rid the land of the menace
###924 that had ravaged his people.
###926 Yet the most trusted of his men,
###929 would not be at his side.
###951 How goes the harvest, my lady?
###953 Bountiful, my lord.
###960 I had expected a little more for my travels.
###965 Are you leaving?
###968 My father has charged me to seek out the enemy's purpose
###972 in the cold mountains of the East.
###974 Alone?
###975 Yes.
###977 A dangerous mission my lord.
###979 Indeed.
###981 There was a time when such danger would not have moved me
###984 and every part of my being would happily travel to the end of the world
###986 in service of our people.
###988 But now?
###992 Now a part of me remains here.
###998 And that is my heart.
###1000 My Lord.
###1002 I am sorry my lady, I did not mean to upset you
###1004 I will look to the East
###1006 and await your safe return.
###1010 My Lady.
###1014 With a heart full of joy
###1017 Arathorn travelled far beyond
###1019 the fallen cities of Arnor.
###1077 While Arathorn made his lonely way into the cold mountains,
###1082 Gilraen would await his homecoming
###1085 in the fading summer of the West.
###1088 Straying at whiles deep into the forest,
###1093 to watch for his safe return.
###1095 Gilraen!
###1096 I will not go far!
###1100 Why does she do that?
###1102 You know for whom she waits.
###1104 She is too young.
###1106 But not without wisdom.
###1108 My heart forebodes Arathorn will wear
###1110 Barahir's ring sooner than expected.
###1112 Even so,
###1114 I do not think he will long lead the Dúnedain,
###1115 once it rests upon his hand.
###1119 Then do not stand in their way, Dírhael!
###1121 For if these two wed soon,
###1123 there yet may be hope born for our people.
###1125 But if they do not,
###1128 it may be, in this gathering darkness,
###1131 that the Dúnedain fall at last,
###1133 never to rise again.
###1136 Let them have what happiness they may!
###1201 You're late!
###1203 Where are the others?
###1205 Slaughtered!
###1206 We were ambushed,
###1207 there are Ghostmen everywhere!
###1209 They are not ghosts!
###1211 Merely Rangers, you coward.
###1213 You're as bad as these two!
###1216 Did you get it?
###1229 These are useless.
###1230 You still have not found the ring that Sauron is seeking.
###1235 Go back! Find it!
###1237 How? There is not enough of us left.
###1239 We need time to increase our numbers.
###1242 It was a mistake to attack the ghostmen out of the darkness, Shaknar!
###1250 I do not make mistakes!
###1260 I go now to report your failer to Sauron at Dol Guldur.
###1266 Increase your numbers if you must, but send out your spies.
###1271 When I return I want to know where he is!
###1280 What is it?
###1281 I smell manflesh.
###1283 That's impossible.
###1284 Can't you smell it?
###1327 Arathorn!  You're back!
###1332 You should not come this far into the forest alone!
###1334 I know.  I…
###1359 Rangers.  Will you not go to them?
###1362 They'll find us soon enough.
###1365 So, I must hurry,
###1368 or miss my chance.
###1370 For what?
###1383 I hope they take their time.
###1394 I train them too well.
###1400 My lord?
###1408 I wandered too far from the village.
###1411 But your captain found me.
###1415 I am at your service, my lord.
###1418 I shall always be at yours.
###1422 Halbaron, escort the Lady Gilraen back to the village.
###1425 At once, my lord.
###1435 Elgarain.  A word.
###1444 I'm sorry, my lord.
###1445 We could not find you. I did not know...
###1447 No apology necessary, my friend.
###1453 Have you ever been in love?
###1456 No.
###1458 It changes your world.
###1460 Consumes it with a burning flame
###1462 that does not abate.
###1465 A light as brilliant and piercing as Eärendil's star.
###1468 You have been in love.
###1471 I have heard it talked of.
###1486 So you are in love?
###1489 I am to be wed!
###1491 Or I hope to be.
###1493 And soon if fortune is with me.
###1495 I wish you joy, my lord.
###1499 Your heart should be filled with joy, Arathorn.
###1503 Oh, it is...
###1504 yet I fear that Lord Dírhael will not willingly give his blessing...
###1509 Gilraen is, like you, not yet of age.
###1513 I may not have known love,
###1516 but I do know that when the heart would command the tongue
###1519 no man should stand in the way...
###1522 if you delay you may find that what should have been spoken
###1528 is forever locked in your heart,
###1531 and regret your only companion.
###1534 Your words are wise…
###1536 still…
###1539 The seasons are changing.
###1541 Maybe it will bring a change to his heart too.
###1544 If it changes with the seasons,
###1547 it can only grow colder.
###1553 Just hold your ground and speak your heart.
###1557 Thank you.
###1559 You're a good friend to me.
###1561 I would lay down my very life for you.
###1564 And I for you.
###1589 I am glad you're safe, my son.
###1591 You also father.
###1592 Halbaron tells me that your campaign against
###1594 the orcs has been a success.
###1596 Their numbers are indeed few now.
###1599 They should not trouble us for some time.
###1603 Yet your mind is not at ease.
###1605 I now know what they're after,
###1608 and that they do not act alone.
###1611 They are servants of Sauron,
###1613 and he seeks the Ring of Barahir.
###1617 Father, they are hunting for you.
###1620 It is as I feared then.
###1622 I beg you to hide the ring.
###1624 Do not wear it!
###1625 No.
###1627 But it will lead them straight to you!
###1629 Let Sauron send all the armies in this world against us.
###1632 I will not hide from who I am,
###1635 while I have a breath in my body,
###1637 and a sword in my hand.
###1638 Forgive me.
###1640 There is nothing to forgive, my son.
###1642 You have been of great service to me, and the Dúnedain.
###1645 You are a true heir of kings!
###1652 Come now, do not be troubled.
###1657 Your mother used to remind me
###1661 that the people look upon us for guidance,
###1663 that we had to stand fast, no matter what.
###1667 Perhaps one day
###1670 you will find someone with as much wisdom and beauty,
###1673 to counsel you.
###1680 You have my blessing, my children.
###1684 May your days be long and fruitful,
###1687 and filled with hope.
###1696 I go now to Rivendell,
###1698 where Elrond Halfelven awaits me.
###1701 When I return with his good counsel,
###1704 then perhaps we shall have a wedding.
###1710 Good luck with Dírhael.
###1729 Lord Dírhael...
###1738 good morning.
###1746 Through the long winter months
###1749 the warmth in Arathorn's heart
###1752 was only held at bay
###1754 by his fear of failing his most important task.
###1764 Just hold your ground,
###1765 and speak your heart.
###1793 Lord Dírhael.
###1797 I have come to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage.
###1800 I owe you my life, son of Arador.
###1803 But I do not owe you my daughter.
###1806 But I love her, my lord.
###1809 I fear deeply the shadow
###1811 you cast on my house, Isildur's Heir.
###1814 The attention you show my daughter is unwelcome...
###1816 By you.
###1818 Not by her.
###1819 Yes.  Therefore it cannot be ignored.
###1825 I hope for Gilraen's sake
###1826 your father's blood flows through your veins.
###1829 If you fail your people,
###1831 you will have only the Dúnedain to answer to.
###1835 If you fail her,
###1838 it is me to whom you'll answer.
###1847 Was that a yes?
###1853 And when Winter had withdrawn it's cold fingers from the land
###1857 and passed into bright and early Spring.
###1861 Arathorn, son of Arador
###1865 and the Lady Gilraen were wed,
###1869 in happiness and hope.
###1938 But after only a year of joy,
###1941 a dark shadow crept back into their lives.
###1946 Arador, son of Argonui,
###1949 Lord of the Dúnedain, found himself in a shallow dell
###1954 amid the chill, blinding vapours of the Coldfells.
###1986 Run!
###1989 Run!
###1995 Where's my father?
###1996 He's further South.
###1997 Go!
###2035 Father!
###2040 Father.
###2051 Arathorn!  Arathorn!  Awake!
###2054 It is nought but a dream!  Awake!
###2056 No!  I saw him!  I felt the breath leave him!
###2060 Shhh!  It's but a dream.  A dream!
###2064 Oh, Gilraen!  Would that it were!
###2070 What hope is there for our people?
###2073 The line of the Kings hangs by a thread,
###2076 I fear it's going to find its bitter end in me.
###2080 Arathorn, where is your joy?
###2084 Where is your hope?
###2087 I will not despair!
###2089 Nor would I have you do so.
###2093 Arathorn, look at me!
###2095 Fear not tomorrow,
###2097 for it is not ours to know or to command.
###2101 And do not fear that the royal house has reached its end.
###2105 It is alive.
###2108 In you.
###2112 And in me.
###2120 There is my Hope.
###2123 So a year after the lose of his father
###2127 on the first day of the third month
###2131 Arathorn and the Dúnedain welcomed into the world new hope.
###2137 You have a son my lord.
###2139 We will name him, Aragorn.
###2141 Kingly Valour, that he shall have,
###2146 but on his breast I see a green stone,
###2149 and from that his true name shall come
###2152 and his chief renown
###2154 for he shall be a healer and a renewer.
###2167 Behold Aragorn,
###2169 son of Arathorn,
###2170 Lord of the Dúnedain!
###2172 Scion of Elendil of Númenor!
###2175 The Heir of Isildur!
###2180 Hail Aragorn!
###2182 Hail Aragorn!
###2186 By the valour of the Lord and his Rangers,
###2189 the Dúnedain had a measure of peace.
###2193 And the child Aragorn grew swiftly and happily.
###2211 Halbaron
###2217 Seems but yesterday that your son Halbarad
###2220 was Aragorn's age.
###2221 It does indeed, my lord.
###2224 I imagine it'll seem the same, Evonyn,
###2226 when our son is a man.
###2228 That it will, my lady.
###2230 How quickly they grow!
###2232 And how much they eat to get there!
###2233 If there's anything left!
###2247 I claim this field in the name of the King!
###2254 Seven stars and a crown on a field of blue
###2256 In the wind of war the banner flew
###2259 Around it the King called men forth
###2262 To fight for freedom in the North
###2265 Fornost has fallen the herald cried
###2268 As Dúnedain they fought and they died
###2270 A man noble and brave fell from his steed
###2273 Trampled by beasts that gave no heed
###2277 The king was carried from the fray
###2279 As the army of Angmar made its way
###2282 Our banner caught in a sea of death
###2284 As the king’s herald drew one last breath
###2287 The banner toppled and fell to the Earth
###2289 The enemy howled in terrible mirth
###2293 As men ran in fear and cried
###2296 The Lords Elladan and Elrohir of Rivendell arrived unlooked for,
###2301 and wished to speak with us at once.
###2305 Welcome, friends!
###2306 What brings you to us this night?
###2308 And how fares your father Lord Elrond?
###2309 And the Lady Arwen?
###2311 Our father and sister are well, my lord.
###2313 It was Elrond who sent us hither in haste.
###2316 Orcs are increasing North and East of Taurdal.
###2320 Their numbers are greater than have been seen in many years.
###2324 Even now they move relentlessly toward
###2325 the northernmost villages of the Dúnedain.
###2328 It will not be long before danger
###2329 presses once more on your borders.
###2332 To Rivendell where the boy doth lie
###2334 And where the banner still flies on high.
###2344 For this reason our father sends grave counsel.
###2347 What is this counsel?
###2349 He urges you to send your wife and son
###2350 to Imladris for safekeeping,
###2353 and for you, Arathorn,
###2354 to lead the Dúnedain by secret ways to other lands,
###2357 and flee this encroaching danger.
###2360 It is late my lords, we will speak further in the morning,
###2364 Let us find you somewhere to rest.
###2373 Elrond Halfelven is wise,
###2376 and sees much that is hidden
###2378 or has yet to come to pass.
###2381 I will consider his words,
###2382 and take thought for my people.
###2384 Let your decision be not long delayed.
###2386 With every hour that passes,
###2387 peril draws closer.
###2389 I understand.  Rest well, my lords.
###2394 Rest well.
###2400 Do not say it!
###2401 I will not be parted from you.
###2403 Yet it is wise counsel.
###2406 If danger closes in on us once again,
###2409 you and Aragorn must be protected.
###2413 All the Chieftains of the Dúnedain have been fostered for a time in Elrond's halls.
###2417 I myself spent years there as a child.
###2419 I will not leave you.
###2421 I will not!
###2451 We know where he is!
###2453 Good.
###2455 Come with me.
###2463 Elgarain!
###2466 Halbaron saw you leaving.
###2468 Something I should have done a long time ago.
###2470 Without goodbye?
###2476 Ever since your father's death,
###2478 I've made it my duty to look out for you.
###2482 I owed it to him for his years of service,
###2484 and his friendship.
###2486 When you wanted to take his place, I alone supported you.
###2491 For ten years you've been by my side,
###2494 yet now, when I need you most,
###2496 you would leave me?
###2498 You need eyes and ears in distant lands,
###2501 and the Ranger post at Hithlin is unmanned.
###2504 Hithlin?
###2505 But it is so far!
###2507 I release you from your duty.
###2509 I will burden you no more.
###2511 You have never been a burden.
###2514 Elgarain, you have only ever been a friend.
###2517 you're like a sister to me.
###2520 You have a family.
###2522 A wife and son who need you.
###2525 Protect them.
###2528 Do not bid me stay!
###2530 Please.
###2534 I will not hold you here if you wish to leave.
###2537 But I do not understand.
###2540 And for that reason, I cannot explain.
###2544 Forgive me.
###2547 Lord Arathorn!  Your counsel is needed.
###2552 Arathorn.  The Enemy is on the move!
###2562 Safe journey, my friend.
###2576 My Lord.  The orcs are on the move.
###2579 Lord Elrohir bid me to say this:
###2581 "The decision has been made for you."
###2592 Call my captains to me.
###2594 War is at hand!
###2622 Well met my friend.
###2625 It is time.
###2630 But while the Lord of the Dúnedain
###2633 and the Sons of Elrond laid their plans,
###2637 the orcs, by stealth and cunning,
###2641 were nearer to the village than even Lord Elrond had foreseen.
###2646 Did you not forget something?
###2648 What would I have forgotten?
###2651 To tell me you were leaving.
###2654 Lord Arathorn needs our help.
###2657 Yet whether he rides to Rivendell
###2658 or leads the Dúnedain to safety elsewhere,
###2662 you will not stay.
###2666 I cannot.
###2668 I see that now.
###2671 I go to free my heart of him.
###2673 Would you not welcome such news?
###2674 Indeed I would.
###2677 For you are ever in my thoughts.
###2680 Did you never know or guess this?
###2683 You've always been kind to me.
###2686 Kind?
###2690 No, Elgarain.
###2696 I love you.
###2697 I have done for years.
###2700 When you knew I loved another?  Why?
###2703 Because in time I knew you would be wise enough to let him go.
###2708 And now I have.
###2710 Only to run from me.
###2717 El, do not run.
###2740 Come with me.
###2750 I will.
###2763 Elgarain!  Flee!
###2765 You cannot hold them off alone!
###2767 Hurry, warn the village!
###2769 No!
###2770 You must warn them,
###2771 for the Dúnedain
###2773 go!
###2775 We will see each other again! Go!
###2790 My lords. My lords!
###2793 We shall not wait for the orcs to make their advance.
###2797 We will evacuate the villages,
###2800 but we will bring war to them in the Wilds,
###2802 wherever they may be.
###2804 So let the servants of Evil beware!
###2806 To arms! To arms!
###2808 To arms! To arms!
###2812 Halbaron!  Our enemy is upon us!
###2822 The forest… Dírhaborn… fights to delay them… orcs everywhere!
###2833 Rangers, to me!
###2853 Are you injured?
###2855 No.
###2857 Gilraen, where is your son? Where is Aragorn?
###2871 Aragorn!?
###2882 Go to the Hall!
###2922 Arathorn! Fall back, fall back!
###2964 There! He's the one!
###2968 Behold your fate.
###2971 Your house has ended!
###2999 Papa... Papa, papa!?
###3005 Two dogs must die today!
###3053 Gilraen!
###3062 My lady, go inside!
###3064 I will not leave you!
###3090 Papa, papa!
###3139 The Dúnedain prevailed.
###3142 But a heavy price was paid for their victory.
###3167 Forgive me.
###3170 For what?
###3172 For my envy…
###3176 because he chose you.
###3180 Elgarain!
###3192 Arathorn, I...
###3194 Save your strength my friend.
###3198 I failed you.
###3200 No.  No, you did not.
###3203 My family is safe because of you.
###3207 Your father would be so proud.
###3219 I found my heart today.
###3225 And now it is lost...
###3227 He was leaving with you?
###3233 I will not lose it all.
###3244 You must live.
###3249 And Aragorn must live.
###3254 We cannot lose our hope!
###3271 Elgarain.
###3273 Elgarain!
###3291 How many more must fall?
###3295 How many?!
###3299 Too long the servants of evil have ravaged our people
###3303 and this once-proud Kingdom of Arnor.
###3319 Men of the West!
###3322 The Shadow grows longer,
###3324 and its cruel arm reaches ever toward us.
###3328 But we cannot lose hope.
###3333 A time will come when the Dúnedain regain their strength,
###3337 and banish evil from these lands forever.
###3341 Until then,
###3343 we have a duty to safe guard our people at all cost.
###3350 So, arise, Dúnedain!
###3354 Remember who you are!
###3356 Let our enemies once again flee before us!
###3359 And let no orc leave this forest alive!
###3365 Gather your rangers. You men with me!
###3375 I will come back to you.  I promise.
###3390 Then Arathorn, son of Arador,
###3394 Lord of the Dúnedain,
###3397 led his people in a great and valiant onslaught,
###3403 and the servants of the Enemy quailed.
###3450 Arathorn, wait!
###3595 Now the line of Kings ends!
###3604 The line is not broken.
###3606 There is still hope!
###3656 They will return, Gilraen.
###3659 They will.
###3664 Lady Gilraen!  Lady Gilraen!
###3667 Lord Arathorn is hurt!
###3684 Has he spoken?
###3686 Only your name, my lady.
###3692 Gilraen?
###3694 I'm here.  I'm here!
###3700 Here is my joy.
###3706 And there is our hope.
###3710 Aragorn, Chieftain of the Dúnedain!
###3768 Then the Lady of the Dúnedain bid farewell to her kin,
###3773 and to all her people,
###3776 for to protect the last children of Númenor
###3780 she bid Halbaron disband Taurdal
###3784 and the Dúnedain to find safety in small secret settlements
###3790 in the depths of the forests of Rhudaur.
###3828 The Heir of Isildur was brought to Rivendell
###3832 for his fostering and safekeeping.
###3837 And that is how you are come here to Master Elrond's house, little one.
###3844 I will not for many long years call you Aragorn.
###3849 For your name must be forgotten.
###3852 Less the enemy learn you live
###3856 and all we fought for is lost.
###3859 For the last time then.
###3864 You are Aragorn,
###3867 Son of Arathorn,
###3870 Chieftain of the Dúnedain
###3872 and the Heir of Isildur.
###3877 But for now,
###3879 Estel,
###3883 you are simply our Hope.
