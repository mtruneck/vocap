0:0:18,14 --> 0:0:21,7
SUROOSH ALVI: And this is about
as quiet as it gets.


3
0:0:21,7 --> 0:0:26,47



4
0:0:26,47 --> 0:0:29,196
Hajj is the largest annual
pilgrimage in the world.


5
0:0:29,196 --> 0:0:31,725
It happens in Mecca,
Saudi Arabia.


6
0:0:31,725 --> 0:0:33,74
And for Muslims, it's a
requirement that you have to


7
0:0:33,74 --> 0:0:35,82
do once in your lifetime.


8
0:0:35,82 --> 0:0:38,85
The Saudi government estimated
that last year there were over


9
0:0:38,85 --> 0:0:41,63
3 million pilgrims who attended,
but the unofficial


10
0:0:41,63 --> 0:0:44,94
number is much higher.


11
0:0:44,94 --> 0:0:47,24
My parents are originally
from Lahore, Pakistan.


12
0:0:47,24 --> 0:0:50,75
They're practicing Muslims, and
last year they decided it


13
0:0:50,75 --> 0:0:52,91
was time for them
to perform Hajj.


14
0:0:52,91 --> 0:0:55,75
So I went with them to help them
with their journey, but


15
0:0:55,75 --> 0:0:57,79
also for myself as well.


16
0:0:57,79 --> 0:0:59,45
It was the first time
for all of us.


17
0:0:59,45 --> 0:1:1,45
And I didn't go thinking I
was going to make a VBS


18
0:1:1,45 --> 0:1:2,22
documentary.


19
0:1:2,22 --> 0:1:5,6
I just took the smallest
handicam we had the office and


20
0:1:5,6 --> 0:1:7,2
literally shot from the hip.


21
0:1:7,2 --> 0:1:9,1
You're not allowed to shoot in
most of the holy places.


22
0:1:9,1 --> 0:1:13,25
So this is the footage I
managed to sneak out.


23
0:1:13,25 --> 0:1:14,975
We flew on Saudi Arabian
airlines.


24
0:1:14,975 --> 0:1:18,54
It was about a 10 hour flight
from JFK to Medina, where we


25
0:1:18,54 --> 0:1:21,885
spent 6 days getting mentally
prepared for the Hajj that we


26
0:1:21,885 --> 0:1:23,135
were about to embark on.


27
0:1:23,135 --> 0:1:25,8



28
0:1:25,8 --> 0:1:29,12
In pre-Islamic times, Medina
was a place where the


29
0:1:29,12 --> 0:1:33,23
travelers who were crossing the
desert in camel caravans


30
0:1:33,23 --> 0:1:34,15
would come to rest.


31
0:1:34,15 --> 0:1:36,79
It was kind of like
a desert oasis.


32
0:1:36,79 --> 0:1:38,93
In modern times it's kind of the
same thing, but there are


33
0:1:38,93 --> 0:1:41,945
less camels and more shopping
malls and hotels.


34
0:1:41,945 --> 0:1:44,42
There's also stunning mosque
there called the Prophet's


35
0:1:44,42 --> 0:1:47,13
Mosque, which is the
second-holiest site in Islam.


36
0:1:47,13 --> 0:1:52,8



37
0:1:52,8 --> 0:1:53,83
When you're there, you basically
just go to the


38
0:1:53,83 --> 0:1:57,74
mosque five times a day, for six
days straight, to get into


39
0:1:57,74 --> 0:2:0,39
a meditative state.


40
0:2:0,39 --> 0:2:1,34
The mosque is huge.


41
0:2:1,34 --> 0:2:3,94
It holds almost 700,000
people.


42
0:2:3,94 --> 0:2:5,74
And when we were there for
the Friday prayer, it


43
0:2:5,74 --> 0:2:7,16
was pretty much full.


44
0:2:7,16 --> 0:2:10,99



45
0:2:10,99 --> 0:2:13,85
Flying to Mecca from Medina
was really interesting.


46
0:2:13,85 --> 0:2:16,55
Before we went to the airport,
we cleansed ourselves in a


47
0:2:16,55 --> 0:2:17,89
very specific way.


48
0:2:17,89 --> 0:2:22,11
And then we had to put on a
white seamless garment made


49
0:2:22,11 --> 0:2:24,75
our of terrycloth that all the
pilgrims have to wear.


50
0:2:24,75 --> 0:2:29,17
And it's a renunciation of the
life that you come from and is


51
0:2:29,17 --> 0:2:32,4
supposed to put everyone
on the same level.


52
0:2:32,4 --> 0:2:33,87
There is no upper class
or lower class.


53
0:2:33,87 --> 0:2:34,62
Everyone's the same.


54
0:2:34,62 --> 0:2:37,868
It's just you and the sheet,
and that's it.


55
0:2:37,868 --> 0:2:41,29
[PRAYING]


56
0:2:41,29 --> 0:2:43,53
This is called getting into
a state of Irham.


57
0:2:43,53 --> 0:2:46,52
Besides the clothes, there
are a lot of other rules.


58
0:2:46,52 --> 0:2:46,995
You can't smoke.


59
0:2:46,995 --> 0:2:48,17
You can't have sex.


60
0:2:48,17 --> 0:2:49,38
You can't shave.


61
0:2:49,38 --> 0:2:52,589
You can't cut your nails,
and there are a


62
0:2:52,589 --> 0:2:55,39
bunch of other no-no's.


63
0:2:55,39 --> 0:2:58,95
So we got this charter, just
for the pilgrims, and 10


64
0:2:58,95 --> 0:3:1,68
minutes after the plane took off
from Medina, the captain


65
0:3:1,68 --> 0:3:4,61
announced that we'd flown over
a designation, and we were in


66
0:3:4,61 --> 0:3:6,28
the zone near Mecca.


67
0:3:6,28 --> 0:3:8,66
And we all had to start
saying a prayer.


68
0:3:8,66 --> 0:3:12,33
And our group guide got onto the
loudspeaker system of the


69
0:3:12,33 --> 0:3:15,1
airplane and started
yelling the prayer.


70
0:3:15,1 --> 0:3:16,705
Everyone started chanting it.


71
0:3:16,705 --> 0:3:19,91
And I had a moment where I
looked around and saw all of


72
0:3:19,91 --> 0:3:22,81
these men and women in their
white robes, the men with


73
0:3:22,81 --> 0:3:24,57
their beards, and just thought,
if someone from the


74
0:3:24,57 --> 0:3:26,3
West could see us right now,
they would think we were a


75
0:3:26,3 --> 0:3:29,55
bunch of fanatical Jihadis
on some kind of an insane


76
0:3:29,55 --> 0:3:33,24
mission, when in reality, it was
just pilgrims excited to


77
0:3:33,24 --> 0:3:34,33
go on this spiritual quest.


78
0:3:34,33 --> 0:3:37,49



79
0:3:37,49 --> 0:3:40,68
I think what was most odd about
this flight were the


80
0:3:40,68 --> 0:3:44,2
flight attendants, who were all
Filipino, wearing their


81
0:3:44,2 --> 0:3:47,7
normal Saudi flight attendant
outfits, looking like they


82
0:3:47,7 --> 0:3:48,44
would rather have any
other gig in the


83
0:3:48,44 --> 0:3:49,69
world than this one.


84
0:3:49,69 --> 0:3:54,19



85
0:3:54,19 --> 0:3:56,89
We landed in Jeddah and
took a bus into Mecca.


86
0:3:56,89 --> 0:3:59,83
And that ride into the city was
one of the wilder scenes


87
0:3:59,83 --> 0:4:1,24
I've ever seen in my life.


88
0:4:1,24 --> 0:4:4,74
There were all these pilgrims
coming from all directions in


89
0:4:4,74 --> 0:4:6,49
all kinds of vehicles.


90
0:4:6,49 --> 0:4:8,89
And you see them riding
on the tops of cars,


91
0:4:8,89 --> 0:4:10,212
and vans, and buses.


92
0:4:10,212 --> 0:4:13,13
I remember seeing a pilgrim
jumping from the roof of one


93
0:4:13,13 --> 0:4:14,3
bus to another.


94
0:4:14,3 --> 0:4:16,446
Everybody's just trying
to get to the city.


95
0:4:16,446 --> 0:4:28,61



96
0:4:28,61 --> 0:4:30,45
Mecca is not a very big city.


97
0:4:30,45 --> 0:4:33,36
And during the year, it's a
relatively mellow place,


98
0:4:33,36 --> 0:4:34,95
except during the
week of Hajj.


99
0:4:34,95 --> 0:4:38,32
The city completely transforms
and half the challenge of


100
0:4:38,32 --> 0:4:41,8
completing your Hajj is getting
all these rituals done


101
0:4:41,8 --> 0:4:43,8
in a very strict timeline,
dealing with the fact there


102
0:4:43,8 --> 0:4:46,3
are about three million other
people there who try to do the


103
0:4:46,3 --> 0:4:47,69
exact same thing at
the same time.


104
0:4:47,69 --> 0:4:51,45



105
0:4:51,45 --> 0:4:54,89
After we checked into our
hotel in Mecca we walked


106
0:4:54,89 --> 0:4:56,66
towards the Grand Mosque,
which is also


107
0:4:56,66 --> 0:4:58,74
known as Masjid Al-Haram.


108
0:4:58,74 --> 0:5:0,82
It's the holiest
place in Islam.


109
0:5:0,82 --> 0:5:2,86
And it's a massive structure.


110
0:5:2,86 --> 0:5:5,75
This Moscow can hold upwards
of four million people with


111
0:5:5,75 --> 0:5:8,61
its outdoor and indoor space,
which, during Hajj, is


112
0:5:8,61 --> 0:5:12,4
technically the largest
gathering of people in the


113
0:5:12,4 --> 0:5:13,93
world at any given time.


114
0:5:13,93 --> 0:5:15,783
This mosque is what Muslims
pray towards from


115
0:5:15,783 --> 0:5:17,65
all over the world.


116
0:5:17,65 --> 0:5:19,76
And as you're walking towards
it, you feel the


117
0:5:19,76 --> 0:5:20,77
anticipation build.


118
0:5:20,77 --> 0:5:23,13
People have been waiting
their whole lives to


119
0:5:23,13 --> 0:5:24,5
come to this place.


120
0:5:24,5 --> 0:5:28,985
And once you enter the mosque,
then you see the Kabeh.


121
0:5:28,985 --> 0:5:32,36



122
0:5:32,36 --> 0:5:34,82
The Kabeh is a black
box in the center


123
0:5:34,82 --> 0:5:36,43
of the Grand Mosque.


124
0:5:36,43 --> 0:5:39,39
And it was built
around 2000 BC.


125
0:5:39,39 --> 0:5:41,45
And people have been praying
towards it since


126
0:5:41,45 --> 0:5:43,11
before Islam started.


127
0:5:43,11 --> 0:5:46,2
And when Prophet Muhammad
finally showed up, he cleaned


128
0:5:46,2 --> 0:5:48,89
up the place, got rid of all the
idols that the pagans had


129
0:5:48,89 --> 0:5:51,61
been worshipping, and reordained
the building as the


130
0:5:51,61 --> 0:5:52,86
House of God.


131
0:5:52,86 --> 0:5:58,69



132
0:5:58,69 --> 0:6:1,84
So in the Grand Mosque, we had
to do our first ritual, which


133
0:6:1,84 --> 0:6:5,67
is called the Tawaf, which
is basically doing seven


134
0:6:5,67 --> 0:6:8,39
counterclockwise laps
around the Kabeh.


135
0:6:8,39 --> 0:6:13,0
And it's kind of like being in
a mosh pit with hundreds of


136
0:6:13,0 --> 0:6:16,0
thousands of people, but instead
of it being full of


137
0:6:16,0 --> 0:6:20,67
angry young punk kids, we were
up against aggressive


138
0:6:20,67 --> 0:6:22,56
Bangladeshi grandmothers.


139
0:6:22,56 --> 0:6:26,54
I had my parents on each arm
interlocked, and we held each


140
0:6:26,54 --> 0:6:29,5
other as we went around the
structure seven times.


141
0:6:29,5 --> 0:6:34,86



142
0:6:34,86 --> 0:6:36,37
You're staring at the Kabeh.


143
0:6:36,37 --> 0:6:39,44
It's a very intense
and heavy vibe.


144
0:6:39,44 --> 0:6:41,91
But the one thing that's a total
bummer is you look up


145
0:6:41,91 --> 0:6:46,0
and all you see are these
massive, luxury five-star


146
0:6:46,0 --> 0:6:49,325
hotels for the super-rich
Muslims who want to pray from


147
0:6:49,325 --> 0:6:50,575
the confines of their room.


148
0:6:50,575 --> 0:7:7,58



149
0:7:7,58 --> 0:7:10,0
After running around the Kabeh
seven times you have to do a


150
0:7:10,0 --> 0:7:12,45
bunch of other rituals in order
to complete your Hajj.


151
0:7:12,45 --> 0:7:13,17
You have five days
to get it done.


152
0:7:13,17 --> 0:7:15,6
And it's kind of like being
on a scavenger hunt.


153
0:7:15,6 --> 0:7:16,83
You have a checklist.


154
0:7:16,83 --> 0:7:17,85
You have to be smart.


155
0:7:17,85 --> 0:7:20,7
And you have to use strategy in
order to make this happen


156
0:7:20,7 --> 0:7:21,32
on schedule.


157
0:7:21,32 --> 0:7:24,32



158
0:7:24,32 --> 0:7:28,3
You have to do the Sa'i, which
is walking and running back


159
0:7:28,3 --> 0:7:30,58
and forth between two hills.


160
0:7:30,58 --> 0:7:33,44
Back in the day he used to be
outdoors and now it's been


161
0:7:33,44 --> 0:7:36,24
turned into indoor structure
with two


162
0:7:36,24 --> 0:7:37,805
very, very long corridors.


163
0:7:37,805 --> 0:7:43,3



164
0:7:43,3 --> 0:7:45,75
You have to spend a day
at Mount Arafat.


165
0:7:45,75 --> 0:7:46,8
It's where the Prophet
delivered


166
0:7:46,8 --> 0:7:48,28
his last sermon from.


167
0:7:48,28 --> 0:7:51,45
And you spend the day in prayer,
and contemplation, and


168
0:7:51,45 --> 0:7:54,44
beg for forgiveness for
all of your sins.


169
0:7:54,44 --> 0:7:56,6
It's a very important day,
and, after spending the


170
0:7:56,6 --> 0:8:0,39
majority of it in a tent, I
walked out and went in the


171
0:8:0,39 --> 0:8:1,72
direction of the mountain.


172
0:8:1,72 --> 0:8:6,9
And I walked through this wild
scene with people everywhere


173
0:8:6,9 --> 0:8:7,967
camped out with their animals.


174
0:8:7,967 --> 0:8:13,22



175
0:8:13,22 --> 0:8:16,92
And as I got closer to mount
Arafat, it was such an


176
0:8:16,92 --> 0:8:18,6
incredible sight because
it had been completely


177
0:8:18,6 --> 0:8:19,3
transformed.


178
0:8:19,3 --> 0:8:20,59
It looked like a snow-covered
peak.


179
0:8:20,59 --> 0:8:28,8



180
0:8:28,8 --> 0:8:31,9
Our tour group operators, before
we went on this trip,


181
0:8:31,9 --> 0:8:32,299
gave us some guidelines.


182
0:8:32,299 --> 0:8:35,929
And the last point on the
sheet said, be patient.


183
0:8:35,929 --> 0:8:37,539
Be very patient.


184
0:8:37,539 --> 0:8:39,94
Be very, very patient.


185
0:8:39,94 --> 0:8:42,71
I fully grasped the meaning of
this when we had to take a


186
0:8:42,71 --> 0:8:45,2
three-kilometer bus ride,
and it ended up


187
0:8:45,2 --> 0:8:46,37
taking eight hours.


188
0:8:46,37 --> 0:8:49,5
It was the middle of the night,
and we had to collect


189
0:8:49,5 --> 0:8:51,58
stones, it was one of our
rituals, in a place called


190
0:8:51,58 --> 0:8:52,37
[INAUDIBLE].


191
0:8:52,37 --> 0:8:54,85
And so we got off the bus.


192
0:8:54,85 --> 0:8:57,15
We navigated our way around
sleeping bodies all over the


193
0:8:57,15 --> 0:8:59,33
ground, found the stones.


194
0:8:59,33 --> 0:9:3,83
And then it was time to pray,
and so we just threw the


195
0:9:3,83 --> 0:9:5,1
prayer rugs down on
the side of the


196
0:9:5,1 --> 0:9:7,17
highway and hit the mats.


197
0:9:7,17 --> 0:9:36,38



198
0:9:36,38 --> 0:9:39,24
After picking up the stones,
we got back on the bus and


199
0:9:39,24 --> 0:9:40,276
drove to Mina.


200
0:9:40,276 --> 0:9:42,7
The Valley of Mina is where
the majority of


201
0:9:42,7 --> 0:9:43,4
the pilgrims stay.


202
0:9:43,4 --> 0:9:46,41
It's a tent city that fills
up with, essentially, the


203
0:9:46,41 --> 0:9:49,17
population of Seattle for a
week and then, after Hajj


204
0:9:49,17 --> 0:9:52,65
ends, it clears out again
and goes away.


205
0:9:52,65 --> 0:9:55,106
It's tents as far as
the eye can see.

0:10:2,8 --> 0:10:2,63
From [INAUDIBLE]


208
0:10:2,63 --> 0:10:6,15
we arrived in Mina, and that's
where we had to stone Satan.


209
0:10:6,15 --> 0:10:7,116
That's the next ritual.


210
0:10:7,116 --> 0:10:9,32
And this one was actually
a lot of fun.


211
0:10:9,32 --> 0:10:13,52
You had to throw 21 stones,
seven at three separate


212
0:10:13,52 --> 0:10:15,85
Satan-stoning stations.


213
0:10:15,85 --> 0:10:18,4
And I finally got to see
what Satan looks like.


214
0:10:18,4 --> 0:10:21,4
Up until a couple years ago,
Satan looked like three big


215
0:10:21,4 --> 0:10:23,7
pillars sticking out
of a large pit.


216
0:10:23,7 --> 0:10:25,23
But the space wasn't big
enough, and there was a


217
0:10:25,23 --> 0:10:26,35
stampede and people died.


218
0:10:26,35 --> 0:10:29,46
So the Saudi government, they
built three ramps the size of


219
0:10:29,46 --> 0:10:32,5
a multi-lane highway, and
there were three pillars


220
0:10:32,5 --> 0:10:34,79
inside of it that represent
the devil.


221
0:10:34,79 --> 0:10:36,98
They're lit in shades
of green.


222
0:10:36,98 --> 0:10:40,2
And there's a strange rumbling
loud sound coming out of them.


223
0:10:40,2 --> 0:10:43,1
And as my dad pointed out, the
whole thing made Satan look


224
0:10:43,1 --> 0:10:44,26
quite surreal.


225
0:10:44,26 --> 0:10:46,98



226
0:10:46,98 --> 0:10:49,77
Before we finished the Hajj, we
had to repeat some of the


227
0:10:49,77 --> 0:10:51,21
rituals that we'd
already done.


228
0:10:51,21 --> 0:10:53,49
So we had to revisit Satan,
throw rocks at


229
0:10:53,49 --> 0:10:55,12
him two more times.


230
0:10:55,12 --> 0:10:58,56
We had to go back to back to
Mecca from Mina and do another


231
0:10:58,56 --> 0:11:1,7
seven counterclockwise laps.


232
0:11:1,7 --> 0:11:3,93
And then it was time for Eid,
which marks the official end


233
0:11:3,93 --> 0:11:6,55
of Hajj, which is a
big celebration.


234
0:11:6,55 --> 0:11:9,71
It's the end of the state of
Irham that we've been in.


235
0:11:9,71 --> 0:11:14,6
And we slaughter an animal
to celebrate it.


236
0:11:14,6 --> 0:11:17,73
And then the last thing you
do is you shave your head.


237
0:11:17,73 --> 0:11:20,42
This is the line for
the barber shop.


238
0:11:20,42 --> 0:11:21,67
This is the line.


239
0:11:21,67 --> 0:11:25,26



240
0:11:25,26 --> 0:11:28,325
Soon, they will all be bald,
all of these men.


241
0:11:28,325 --> 0:11:30,78
The barber shops in Mecca
have these massive


242
0:11:30,78 --> 0:11:32,32
lines outside of them.


243
0:11:32,32 --> 0:11:35,59
And you see hundreds of
thousands of baldos walking


244
0:11:35,59 --> 0:11:36,4
around town.


245
0:11:36,4 --> 0:11:38,8
And those people have
all succeeded in


246
0:11:38,8 --> 0:11:39,84
completing their Hajj.


247
0:11:39,84 --> 0:11:41,9
And they're called Hajjis.


248
0:11:41,9 --> 0:11:49,85



249
0:11:49,85 --> 0:11:51,88
Dealing with the Hajj every
year is a huge logistical


250
0:11:51,88 --> 0:11:53,54
challenge for the Saudi
government--


251
0:11:53,54 --> 0:11:55,0
to the point where they've
actually set up


252
0:11:55,0 --> 0:11:56,97
a Ministry of Hajj.


253
0:11:56,97 --> 0:11:59,19
In the past, there have been
incidents where pilgrims were


254
0:11:59,19 --> 0:12:3,31
trampled, when ramps collapsed
and pilgrims died, and the


255
0:12:3,31 --> 0:12:6,16
Saudi government has invested
billions of dollars to create


256
0:12:6,16 --> 0:12:9,22
an infrastructure to make this
work, with complex crowd


257
0:12:9,22 --> 0:12:10,36
control techniques.


258
0:12:10,36 --> 0:12:13,88
And what I saw when I went last
year was something that


259
0:12:13,88 --> 0:12:15,71
somehow manages to work.


260
0:12:15,71 --> 0:12:20,25



261
0:12:20,25 --> 0:12:22,32
But it kind of goes without
saying that bringing 3 million


262
0:12:22,32 --> 0:12:25,11
people into such a small place
is going to bring up some


263
0:12:25,11 --> 0:12:26,82
complications.


264
0:12:26,82 --> 0:12:28,5
There's a bit of a dark side.


265
0:12:28,5 --> 0:12:30,81
This many people in such
a small place,


266
0:12:30,81 --> 0:12:32,2
it really gets unwieldy.


267
0:12:32,2 --> 0:12:34,3
And despite the Saudi
government's best efforts to


268
0:12:34,3 --> 0:12:36,83
deal with this profound
logistical challenge, the


269
0:12:36,83 --> 0:12:38,96
bottom line is that there
are too many people.


270
0:12:38,96 --> 0:12:41,1
And people need things.


271
0:12:41,1 --> 0:12:42,68
They need places to sleep.


272
0:12:42,68 --> 0:12:43,486
They need food.


273
0:12:43,486 --> 0:12:45,23
The need toilets.


274
0:12:45,23 --> 0:12:47,96
And the poor people who were
there, you see them basically


275
0:12:47,96 --> 0:12:51,2
camped out on the side of the
road for days on end.


276
0:12:51,2 --> 0:12:54,72
It really felt like Mecca was
maxing out by the end of Hajj.


277
0:12:54,72 --> 0:12:57,269
And the whole scene starts
looking and feeling rather


278
0:12:57,269 --> 0:12:58,519
apocalyptic.


279
0:12:58,519 --> 0:13:32,24



280
0:13:32,24 --> 0:13:33,91
No matter where all these
people come from.


281
0:13:33,91 --> 0:13:34,73
No matter what they do.


282
0:13:34,73 --> 0:13:37,43
And no matter how rich or poor
they might be, during this


283
0:13:37,43 --> 0:13:39,4
pilgrimage to Mecca it
felt like everyone


284
0:13:39,4 --> 0:13:41,25
was just the same.


285
0:13:41,25 --> 0:13:43,85
It was unlike any place I've
ever been and unlike anything


286
0:13:43,85 --> 0:13:45,29
I've ever experienced.


287
0:13:45,29 --> 0:13:48,5
I was there standing amongst
millions of people, I was


288
0:13:48,5 --> 0:13:51,356
there with my family, but, on
some level, I felt like I all


289
0:13:51,356 --> 0:13:53,98
alone, on a personal trek.


290
0:13:53,98 --> 0:13:56,27
And everyday life felt like it
was hundreds of thousands of


291
0:13:56,27 --> 0:13:58,6
miles away.


292
0:13:58,6 --> 0:13:59,51
We flew back to New York.


293
0:13:59,51 --> 0:14:1,48
We landed in the morning, and
I went straight back to the


294
0:14:1,48 --> 0:14:3,73
Vice offices, which
may not have been


295
0:14:3,73 --> 0:14:5,126
the wisests of ideas.


296
0:14:5,126 --> 0:14:7,44
I felt like I'd been catapulted
from one end of the


297
0:14:7,44 --> 0:14:8,69
universe to the other.


298
0:14:8,69 --> 0:16:8,69
