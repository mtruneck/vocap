0:0:27,25 --> 0:0:29,62
LEVI: My name is Levi.


4
0:0:29,62 --> 0:0:31,49
And I am one of the guides in
the Impenetrable Forest.


5
0:0:31,49 --> 0:0:34,78



6
0:0:34,78 --> 0:0:38,4
Now this here Bwindi Forest is
the forest very special for


7
0:0:38,4 --> 0:0:41,15
being a home to critically
endangered mountain gorillas.


8
0:0:41,15 --> 0:0:44,83
Yeah, we are going to start the
gorilla tracking journey.


9
0:0:44,83 --> 0:0:49,84
And which will take us possibly
the whole day into


10
0:0:49,84 --> 0:0:53,65
the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest,
an island within the


11
0:0:53,65 --> 0:0:54,93
communities.


12
0:0:54,93 --> 0:0:58,94
When you look at the map of
Africa, you get Uganda, then


13
0:0:58,94 --> 0:1:6,12
bordering Congo, DRC, that is
the location of Bwindi.


14
0:1:6,12 --> 0:1:9,825
We started in an open place, and
you can see here where we


15
0:1:9,825 --> 0:1:12,97
are going, this is a
primary forest now.


16
0:1:12,97 --> 0:1:17,84



17
0:1:17,84 --> 0:1:21,62
DR. RICHARD CARROLL: Mountain
gorillas only exist on that


18
0:1:21,62 --> 0:1:25,63
patch of habitat in the
mountains of the Virungas.


19
0:1:25,63 --> 0:1:29,94
And they only exist in those
three countries, in just a


20
0:1:29,94 --> 0:1:31,96
real small area.


21
0:1:31,96 --> 0:1:33,67
They're not in zoos.


22
0:1:33,67 --> 0:1:37,43
The zoo population of gorillas
are western lowland gorillas,


23
0:1:37,43 --> 0:1:39,41
for the most part.


24
0:1:39,41 --> 0:1:40,37
So this is it.


25
0:1:40,37 --> 0:1:45,68
Their whole survival rests in
this patch of habitat that's


26
0:1:45,68 --> 0:1:47,73
really isolated on these
mountaintops.


27
0:1:47,73 --> 0:1:50,92
And there's only 720 of them
that exist in the world.


28
0:1:50,92 --> 0:1:52,62
And they're all in this
area And it's


29
0:1:52,62 --> 0:1:56,9
surrounded by a sea of humans.


30
0:1:56,9 --> 0:2:1,3
LEVI: These mountain gorillas,
they are the great apes.


31
0:2:1,3 --> 0:2:3,68
Human beings are also
the great apes.


32
0:2:3,68 --> 0:2:6,46
The behaviors, the way they
behave when you look at them,


33
0:2:6,46 --> 0:2:8,71
it's very, very marvelous.


34
0:2:8,71 --> 0:2:13,23
They behave like people,
like human beings.


35
0:2:13,23 --> 0:2:16,4
DR. RICHARD CARROLL: The first
time that you see a gorilla


36
0:2:16,4 --> 0:2:20,93
through that veil of vegetation,
and he's looking


37
0:2:20,93 --> 0:2:23,78
at you, and you look at him, and
you catch him in the eye,


38
0:2:23,78 --> 0:2:27,83
and it's really clear that
there's a species connection.


39
0:2:27,83 --> 0:2:32,55
We share a good part of our
genes, and you can see so much


40
0:2:32,55 --> 0:2:38,902
of human behavior reflected or
derived from behavior of some


41
0:2:38,902 --> 0:2:42,14
of the great apes.


42
0:2:42,14 --> 0:2:46,19
LEVI: Mountain Gorillas
are 99% vegetarians.


43
0:2:46,19 --> 0:2:49,535
Most of the food they
eat is leaves, bark


44
0:2:49,535 --> 0:2:52,71
of trees, and fruits.


45
0:2:52,71 --> 0:2:59,11
But 1% to make 100% of their
food is the ants.


46
0:2:59,11 --> 0:3:2,4
So they change that diet
by eating ants,


47
0:3:2,4 --> 0:3:3,29
actually to get proteins.


48
0:3:3,29 --> 0:3:6,0



49
0:3:6,0 --> 0:3:7,86
DR. RICHARD CARROLL: Opening
up the forest with coffee


50
0:3:7,86 --> 0:3:11,53
plantations and logging
companies from Yugoslavia and


51
0:3:11,53 --> 0:3:15,18
the French to Spanish to Dutch,
when they came in to


52
0:3:15,18 --> 0:3:18,68
get that very valuable hardwood
out of the forest.


53
0:3:18,68 --> 0:3:21,2
And of course, they're
bringing labor


54
0:3:21,2 --> 0:3:22,37
from around the country.


55
0:3:22,37 --> 0:3:25,86
So the population demographics
changed drastically.


56
0:3:25,86 --> 0:3:30,36
So it's a very dense human
population with agriculture


57
0:3:30,36 --> 0:3:33,17
bordering right up
to the parks.


58
0:3:33,17 --> 0:3:37,59
LEVI: Lifespan of these mountain
gorillas is 50 years,


59
0:3:37,59 --> 0:3:39,44
here in the wild.


60
0:3:39,44 --> 0:3:42,27
But when the people started
settling around, then they


61
0:3:42,27 --> 0:3:45,5
started clearing their
habitat for farming.


62
0:3:45,5 --> 0:3:47,3
And also killing them.


63
0:3:47,3 --> 0:3:49,13
Then they started becoming
very few.


64
0:3:49,13 --> 0:3:51,8
Their numbers started
reducing.


65
0:3:51,8 --> 0:3:55,19
Bwindi has about half of
the world's population,


66
0:3:55,19 --> 0:3:59,33
which is about 340.


67
0:3:59,33 --> 0:4:2,59
DR. RICHARD CARROLL: Bushmeat
refers to the capture and


68
0:4:2,59 --> 0:4:6,45
killing of wild game for
commercial purposes.


69
0:4:6,45 --> 0:4:10,7
They set snares on wildlife
trails that are totally


70
0:4:10,7 --> 0:4:12,2
indiscriminate.


71
0:4:12,2 --> 0:4:14,58
And even gorillas get
caught in them.


72
0:4:14,58 --> 0:4:16,94
It'll tighten around its
hand or foot, and


73
0:4:16,94 --> 0:4:18,529
the hand will atrophy.


74
0:4:18,529 --> 0:4:23,78
So there's a lot of mutilation
and mortality from these


75
0:4:23,78 --> 0:4:27,0
snares that are ubiquitous
around the forest.


76
0:4:27,0 --> 0:4:30,76
And so the real threats right
now are human population


77
0:4:30,76 --> 0:4:32,87
growth, it's the main threat.


78
0:4:32,87 --> 0:4:34,83
Insecurity.


79
0:4:34,83 --> 0:4:37,59
This area has been an
area of political


80
0:4:37,59 --> 0:4:39,19
instability for a long time.


81
0:4:39,19 --> 0:4:41,91
In all three countries,
there's been national


82
0:4:41,91 --> 0:4:43,91
conflicts and regional
conflicts.


83
0:4:43,91 --> 0:4:48,23
Uganda went through years of the
most horrible dictatorship


84
0:4:48,23 --> 0:4:52,9
under Idi Amin, where wildlife
populations were decimated


85
0:4:52,9 --> 0:4:53,2
throughout the country.


86
0:4:53,2 --> 0:4:55,19
Rwanda went through
a genocide.


87
0:4:55,19 --> 0:4:59,41
DRC has been at war since
1993 and before.


88
0:4:59,41 --> 0:5:2,55
Millions of people died
in those wars.


89
0:5:2,55 --> 0:5:5,56
Millions of people displaced.


90
0:5:5,56 --> 0:5:7,53
It goes on to right now.


91
0:5:7,53 --> 0:5:14,31



92
0:5:14,31 --> 0:5:16,98
LEVI: OK, this side where we
are overlooking is Bwindi


93
0:5:16,98 --> 0:5:18,69
Impenetrable Forest.


94
0:5:18,69 --> 0:5:24,4
And as you go to the slope,
on this side is DRC.


95
0:5:24,4 --> 0:5:27,6
And where you see across, you
see the bananas, that's the


96
0:5:27,6 --> 0:5:30,2
village on the Uganda side.


97
0:5:30,2 --> 0:5:33,63
But if you go beyond, then
you are in the DRC.


98
0:5:33,63 --> 0:5:50,81
[MUSIC PLAYING]


99
0:5:50,81 --> 0:5:54,34
LEVI: When we get to the
gorillas, we will have a sound


100
0:5:54,34 --> 0:5:55,72
that we make.


101
0:5:55,72 --> 0:5:59,0
We imitate their vocalization
so that they come down, they


102
0:5:59,0 --> 0:6:2,12
know we are friendly, we have
no problem to them.


103
0:6:2,12 --> 0:6:5,768
And that's Sowendi That
vocalization is [GROWLING ].


104
0:6:5,768 --> 0:6:12,95



105
0:6:12,95 --> 0:6:14,385
Like cause they also
communicate.


106
0:6:14,385 --> 0:6:18,22



107
0:6:18,22 --> 0:6:21,92
They live with families,
headed by silverbacks.


108
0:6:21,92 --> 0:6:25,51
And having only one dominant
silverback, only one lead


109
0:6:25,51 --> 0:6:30,5
male, who leads the
whole family.


110
0:6:30,5 --> 0:6:32,11
DR. RICHARD CARROLL: The first
time I saw mountain gorillas


111
0:6:32,11 --> 0:6:35,86
was in the Bwindi National
Park in Uganda.


112
0:6:35,86 --> 0:6:40,8
And when we got up there, the
silverback gave us a really


113
0:6:40,8 --> 0:6:46,54
great sideways sort of false
charge to let us know that he


114
0:6:46,54 --> 0:6:47,84
was the boss.


115
0:6:47,84 --> 0:6:52,66
Interestingly, that silverback
was missing a hand from a


116
0:6:52,66 --> 0:6:53,91
snare wound.


117
0:6:53,91 --> 0:6:55,66



118
0:6:55,66 --> 0:6:58,94
What you need to do when you're
around gorillas is do


119
0:6:58,94 --> 0:7:2,1
everything you can do
to look submissive.


120
0:7:2,1 --> 0:7:5,44
Slowly go down to the ground,
pretend like you're feeding on


121
0:7:5,44 --> 0:7:8,33
leaves, and sort of act like a
monkey, which comes sort of


122
0:7:8,33 --> 0:7:11,19
naturally to some
of us anyways.


123
0:7:11,19 --> 0:7:14,25
But running is the
wrong thing.


124
0:7:14,25 --> 0:7:15,71
LEVI: If one dominant
silverback


125
0:7:15,71 --> 0:7:17,77
start getting weak--


126
0:7:17,77 --> 0:7:20,58
he's very weak, he cannot
protect the family--


127
0:7:20,58 --> 0:7:23,37
he leaves the powers to the
youngest, who is very strong


128
0:7:23,37 --> 0:7:27,33
enough to defend the family.


129
0:7:27,33 --> 0:7:29,38
But sometime they can fight.


130
0:7:29,38 --> 0:7:31,21
We don't have any evidence
that they have


131
0:7:31,21 --> 0:7:33,55
ever fought to death.


132
0:7:33,55 --> 0:7:36,6
But they can fight and
harm each other.


133
0:7:36,6 --> 0:7:41,6
During the fighting of some
primates, they kill those


134
0:7:41,6 --> 0:7:46,18
babies so that they can now have
the females in the estrus


135
0:7:46,18 --> 0:7:49,8
period and start the mating
process and also


136
0:7:49,8 --> 0:7:50,265
produce their own.


137
0:7:50,265 --> 0:7:56,29
That's how we get new groups,
new families started.


138
0:7:56,29 --> 0:7:58,68
We are communicating
with the trackers.


139
0:7:58,68 --> 0:8:0,73
They are just in front of
us some few meters.


140
0:8:0,73 --> 0:8:3,62



141
0:8:3,62 --> 0:8:8,16
When you see the trackers that
means the gorillas are near.


142
0:8:8,16 --> 0:8:10,29
The guys have already done
a wonderful job of


143
0:8:10,29 --> 0:8:11,78
locating them to us.


144
0:8:11,78 --> 0:8:14,17
MEDI: He has located
the gorillas.


145
0:8:14,17 --> 0:8:17,62
They have started from where
they left them yesterday.


146
0:8:17,62 --> 0:8:20,3
The smell also helps them.


147
0:8:20,3 --> 0:8:23,48
Mostly the smell from the
armpits of the silverback.


148
0:8:23,48 --> 0:8:31,5
[MUSIC PLAYING]


149
0:8:31,5 --> 0:8:33,919
LEVI: When you get to the
gorillas, we branch into the


150
0:8:33,919 --> 0:8:38,33
bush to directly where
the gorillas are.


151
0:8:38,33 --> 0:8:41,2
As I told you that they very,
very closely related to us,


152
0:8:41,2 --> 0:8:44,71
and we are visiting them
everyday, so at times we also


153
0:8:44,71 --> 0:8:48,19
monitor to see maybe they could
get like some germs,


154
0:8:48,19 --> 0:8:52,92
some bacterias, parasites
from human beings.


155
0:8:52,92 --> 0:8:55,8
The jungle here is very dense.


156
0:8:55,8 --> 0:8:57,88
So you may be asking yourselves,
how do we know the


157
0:8:57,88 --> 0:8:59,19
population.


158
0:8:59,19 --> 0:9:3,13
We found the last night
nests, which are here.


159
0:9:3,13 --> 0:9:7,32
And then when we want to know
group categories, we have to


160
0:9:7,32 --> 0:9:7,98
look at the dung.


161
0:9:7,98 --> 0:9:9,88
For the babies it's small.


162
0:9:9,88 --> 0:9:13,7
The juveniles, also
small a bit.


163
0:9:13,7 --> 0:9:17,3
Then adult female also
small somehow.


164
0:9:17,3 --> 0:9:19,37
But for the silverback
it's big.


165
0:9:19,37 --> 0:9:23,11
And as he said that when
trackers are following, they


166
0:9:23,11 --> 0:9:25,25
have got signs they
go looking for.


167
0:9:25,25 --> 0:9:28,25
So for them they were looking
for the feedings like these


168
0:9:28,25 --> 0:9:31,16
ones, which they have
left behind.


169
0:9:31,16 --> 0:9:32,88
DR. RICHARD CARROLL: There's
only 720 of them that


170
0:9:32,88 --> 0:9:34,8
exist in the world.


171
0:9:34,8 --> 0:9:35,51
And they're all in this area.


172
0:9:35,51 --> 0:9:38,38
And there's pressures
for other resources.


173
0:9:38,38 --> 0:9:46,38
With minerals, [INAUDIBLE],
gold, oil and gas, it has huge


174
0:9:46,38 --> 0:9:47,89
threats for the future.


175
0:9:47,89 --> 0:9:51,93
What happened in the Virunga
National Park in DRC, where 10


176
0:9:51,93 --> 0:9:56,475
gorillas were killed was a
combination of an economic and


177
0:9:56,475 --> 0:9:58,7
a political statement.


178
0:9:58,7 --> 0:10:2,34
It wasn't poaching by local
communities for food or for


179
0:10:2,34 --> 0:10:3,54
subsistence.


180
0:10:3,54 --> 0:10:7,78
The tensions are still there
from the conflict between


181
0:10:7,78 --> 0:10:10,9
Rwanda and DRC.


182
0:10:10,9 --> 0:10:14,26
There's many rebel factions
that are hiding


183
0:10:14,26 --> 0:10:16,81
out in those forests.


184
0:10:16,81 --> 0:10:22,71
Supplying charcoal to the
cities, transporting it to do


185
0:10:22,71 --> 0:10:27,6
the population centers was a
multimillion dollar operation


186
0:10:27,6 --> 0:10:30,3
that was helping to support a
lot of these rebel factions


187
0:10:30,3 --> 0:10:33,0
and keep them in business,
allow them to function.


188
0:10:33,0 --> 0:10:36,73
And they were working through
the local population.


189
0:10:36,73 --> 0:10:41,14
It's also a sign the presence of
conservation was getting on


190
0:10:41,14 --> 0:10:44,97
their nerves, so they were not
able to operate with impunity.


191
0:10:44,97 --> 0:10:46,9
So they were making a sign.


192
0:10:46,9 --> 0:10:50,6
You guys care so much about
these mountain gorillas, well


193
0:10:50,6 --> 0:10:52,67
we're gonna make a sign that's
really going to have


194
0:10:52,67 --> 0:10:54,622
an impact on you.

200
0:12:9,17 --> 0:12:10,47
DR. RICHARD CARROLL: Gorillas
really hold a real


201
0:12:10,47 --> 0:12:13,11
fascination, I think,
from history.


202
0:12:13,11 --> 0:12:17,6
All of us grew up with Tarzan
movies and King Kong.


203
0:12:17,6 --> 0:12:19,88
And they've always
held a mystery.


204
0:12:19,88 --> 0:12:24,67
And they're always so close
to humans, but the


205
0:12:24,67 --> 0:12:26,55
image of being so strong.


206
0:12:26,55 --> 0:12:30,65
And often a mistaken image of
them being so ferocious.


207
0:12:30,65 --> 0:12:59,75

0:12:59,75 --> 0:13:14,11
[GROWLING]


209
0:13:14,11 --> 0:13:16,26
DR. RICHARD CARROLL: A
silverback gorilla is big.


210
0:13:16,26 --> 0:13:20,91
It weighs 400 pounds and has big
canines and a huge jaw to


211
0:13:20,91 --> 0:13:24,1
defend his harem.


212
0:13:24,1 --> 0:13:29,37
So he's defending his
resources, as well.


213
0:13:29,37 --> 0:13:35,65
That exists in our primate
memory that


214
0:13:35,65 --> 0:13:36,91
carries on to today.


215
0:13:36,91 --> 0:13:55,1



216
0:13:55,1 --> 0:13:56,26
-He's picking his nose.


217
0:13:56,26 --> 0:13:58,8



218
0:13:58,8 --> 0:13:59,24
-He is.


219
0:13:59,24 --> 0:14:0,49
He just ate it.


220
0:14:0,49 --> 0:14:25,68



221
0:14:25,68 --> 0:14:28,78
DR. RICHARD CARROLL: Gorillas
live in pretty low density.


222
0:14:28,78 --> 0:14:31,457
There's aggression between the
silverbacks trying to compete


223
0:14:31,457 --> 0:14:35,44
for females and things
like that.


224
0:14:35,44 --> 0:14:37,215
But there's enough room.


225
0:14:37,215 --> 0:14:41,9



226
0:14:41,9 --> 0:14:43,79
We are in such high population
densities


227
0:14:43,79 --> 0:14:45,59
in a shrinking planet.


228
0:14:45,59 --> 0:14:48,86
Right now with the amount of
people on this planet we need


229
0:14:48,86 --> 0:14:50,89
two planets to support us.


230
0:14:50,89 --> 0:14:52,24
And it's going to lead
to more and more


231
0:14:52,24 --> 0:14:54,55
conflict over resources.


232
0:14:54,55 --> 0:14:57,36
We're producing climate change
that's going to change those


233
0:14:57,36 --> 0:14:59,64
resources and make
them scarcer.


234
0:14:59,64 --> 0:15:0,905
All the time it's more people.


235
0:15:0,905 --> 0:15:4,82



236
0:15:4,82 --> 0:15:12,14
And I felt from the beginning
that if we as humans can't


237
0:15:12,14 --> 0:15:17,15
protect our closest family
relatives then we really will


238
0:15:17,15 --> 0:15:18,99
fail as a species ourselves.
