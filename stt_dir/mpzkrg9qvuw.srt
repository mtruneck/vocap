1
0:0:48,882 --> 0:0:51,969
- Whoa.
- What a wild kickflip wallplant!


2
0:0:51,969 --> 0:0:54,263
It takes me back to my boarding days.


3
0:0:54,263 --> 0:0:57,224
Funny. Cos I feel like
the only boarding you did


4
0:0:57,224 --> 0:1:0,561
was with Charlie and Henry
and the horrid biscuit game.


5
0:1:0,561 --> 0:1:3,63
Oh, OK, yeah, fair point.


6
0:1:3,63 --> 0:1:6,108
The competition has been amazing.
The girls have been great.


7
0:1:6,108 --> 0:1:9,653
But the one everyone is talking about,
Kim Matthews, is still missing.


8
0:1:9,653 --> 0:1:14,408
We've actually got some footage of her
as an early skateboarding prodigy.


9
0:1:14,408 --> 0:1:16,535
Kim started competing
when she was seven.


10
0:1:16,535 --> 0:1:18,412
She won the National
Mixed Under-16s


11
0:1:18,412 --> 0:1:20,414
when she was just 11 years old.


12
0:1:20,414 --> 0:1:22,541
I mean, attractive girl even then.


13
0:1:22,541 --> 0:1:25,627
- Really? Because I said 11.
- Yeah, objectively.


14
0:1:25,627 --> 0:1:27,212
Two years ago, aged 17,


15
0:1:27,212 --> 0:1:28,797
she won the London Trials.


16
0:1:28,797 --> 0:1:32,9
Mum and Dad supported her


17
0:1:32,9 --> 0:1:33,385
with parental pride


18
0:1:33,385 --> 0:1:35,596
and simplistic homemade signs.


19
0:1:35,596 --> 0:1:38,682
Then nothing. We haven't seen her since.


20
0:1:38,682 --> 0:1:40,809
There was an accident, Rick.


21
0:1:40,809 --> 0:1:43,812
The car crash, when she lost her mum.


22
0:1:43,812 --> 0:1:47,232
We're thinking of you, Kim.
Wherever you are,


23
0:1:47,232 --> 0:1:51,486
whatever you're doing, we hope
you're riding high and living the dream.


24
0:1:51,486 --> 0:1:54,781
And todayk special:
two for one on onion rings.


25
0:1:54,781 --> 0:1:56,325
Onion rings, two for one.


26
0:1:56,325 --> 0:2:6,376
Please don't push.


27
0:2:6,376 --> 0:2:9,421
I thought it was junk mail.
-Big red letters.


28
0:2:9,421 --> 0:2:11,882
"Notjunk mail."
It says "Urgent Demand" on it.


29
0:2:11,882 --> 0:2:18,513
- They always say that. it's hardly...
- it's nearly a grand.


30
0:2:18,513 --> 0:2:21,391
Dad, you can'tjust ignore it.


31
0:2:21,391 --> 0:2:25,187
But, hey, we're big hitters, right?
We'll just sell the Bentley.


32
0:2:25,187 --> 0:2:29,65
Oh, no, someone's stolen the Bentley.
Plan B?


33
0:2:29,65 --> 0:2:34,488
They're bluffing.
I'll think of something.


34
0:2:34,488 --> 0:2:37,574
How are you getting on?


35
0:2:37,574 --> 0:2:41,87
No. Nothing yet.


36
0:2:41,87 --> 0:2:45,791
- I'll talk to Les. Sort something out.
- What would I do without you?


37
0:2:45,791 --> 0:2:48,96
Fester.


38
0:2:48,96 --> 0:2:50,796
Hmm!


39
0:2:50,796 --> 0:2:56,259
My rota is... full.


40
0:2:56,259 --> 0:3:0,472
Maybe if you're extra nice to me? Hmm?


41
0:3:0,472 --> 0:3:3,892
Oh, Les, don't be a cock all your life.


42
0:3:3,892 --> 0:3:6,19
That's your extra nice?


43
0:3:6,19 --> 0:3:9,439
How did my summerjob
become the rest-of-my life job?


44
0:3:9,439 --> 0:3:13,26
A friend of my cousin's
just got into this well-good scam.


45
0:3:13,26 --> 0:3:20,33
Catering agencies. Serving champagne
and tiny food to toffs. £12.50 an hour.


46
0:3:20,33 --> 0:3:25,539
Hmm. Toffs and champagne
or Les and... Urgh.


47
0:3:25,539 --> 0:3:29,584
I can get the number if you want.
You gotta be posh, though.


48
0:3:29,584 --> 0:3:34,47
Posh? Trace, I can do posh.


49
0:3:34,47 --> 0:3:37,634
- Hi, I'm Arabella.
- I'm Henrietta.


50
0:3:37,634 --> 0:3:42,347
- Isabella.
- Petronella.


51
0:3:42,347 --> 0:3:43,557
Kim.


52
0:3:43,557 --> 0:3:46,435
White wine? Yes.


53
0:3:46,435 --> 0:3:48,145
Red wine?


54
0:3:48,145 --> 0:3:50,355
Yes.


55
0:3:50,355 --> 0:3:53,775
Dessert wine?


56
0:3:53,775 --> 0:3:54,901
No.


57
0:3:54,901 --> 0:3:59,906
I ls it true what they say
about posh girls?


58
0:3:59,906 --> 0:4:5,662
I ls it true what they say
about posh girls?


59
0:4:5,662 --> 0:4:9,583
shit.


60
0:4:9,583 --> 0:4:12,753
You're a lovely girl,
but I'm just not sure.


61
0:4:12,753 --> 0:4:15,38
Let me try. You're just not sure


62
0:4:15,38 --> 0:4:17,716
I'm the right kind of girl
for your clients.


63
0:4:17,716 --> 0:4:20,93
It's hard to say why exactly,


64
0:4:20,93 --> 0:4:23,597
but it's probably to do with the fact
that I'm not called Arabella


65
0:4:23,597 --> 0:4:25,932
or Isabella or anything-bella.


66
0:4:25,932 --> 0:4:28,852
I don't have hundred-quid highlights,
perfect nails


67
0:4:28,852 --> 0:4:32,314
or, I'm just guessing here,
expensively trimmed pubes.


68
0:4:32,314 --> 0:4:34,232
So even though I'm the only person


69
0:4:34,232 --> 0:4:37,527
with actual experience of actual work
in the actual real world,


70
0:4:37,527 --> 0:4:42,699
and you know
I'd try really, really hard,


71
0:4:42,699 --> 0:4:47,204
I'm just not the right kind of girl.


72
0:4:47,204 --> 0:4:56,87
- Is that about the size of it?
- About there, yes.


73
0:4:56,87 --> 0:4:58,924
This is Bella.


74
0:4:58,924 --> 0:5:1,259
She did what?


75
0:5:1,259 --> 0:5:4,679
Oh, for God's sake, the silly cow.


76
0:5:4,679 --> 0:5:10,852
Yes, it's the day after tomorrow.
Everyone's booked out.


77
0:5:10,852 --> 0:5:12,938
Wait there,


78
0:5:12,938 --> 0:5:16,775
er,... Kim.


79
0:5:16,775 --> 0:5:18,902
- It sounds great.
- I said no.


80
0:5:18,902 --> 0:5:21,279
- What was the job?
- Cooking and cleaning.


81
0:5:21,279 --> 0:5:23,698
Same as I do at work.
Same as I do here.


82
0:5:23,698 --> 0:5:26,993
- Was the pay rubbish?
- No, it's better. Double, plus tips.


83
0:5:26,993 --> 0:5:29,996
But... But still...


84
0:5:29,996 --> 0:5:32,123
But still what?


85
0:5:32,123 --> 0:5:37,212
It's in a ski chalet. In Austria.


86
0:5:37,212 --> 0:5:38,839
For four months.


87
0:5:38,839 --> 0:5:42,801
- Right. Well, I'm sure I could...
- You couldn't.


88
0:5:42,801 --> 0:5:48,98
I'd come home and find a skeleton
on the couch holding the remote.


89
0:5:48,98 --> 0:5:49,683
That's a bit harsh.


90
0:5:49,683 --> 0:5:52,644
- Totally the right decision.
- You think so?


91
0:5:52,644 --> 0:5:57,774
Yeah. What's a luxury chalet with hot,
rich clients in a beautiful ski resort


92
0:5:57,774 --> 0:6:0,443
got on this place? it's a no-brainer.


93
0:6:0,443 --> 0:6:4,489
- Oi, I found this toenail in my...
- Don't even try.


94
0:6:4,489 --> 0:6:8,577
See? Would you get that kind of
quality entertainment in Austria?


95
0:6:8,577 --> 0:6:18,92
I don't think so.


96
0:6:18,92 --> 0:6:22,549
Hi, it's Kim Matthews from yesterday.
I was wondering if you're still...


97
0:6:22,549 --> 0:6:25,552
Still desperately seeking
a chalet girl? Yes, I am.


98
0:6:25,552 --> 0:6:27,596
- You are?
- Could you do it?


99
0:6:27,596 --> 0:6:33,935
You have to be there tomorrow.
It's ten hours on the overnight train.


100
0:6:33,935 --> 0:6:36,897
Right. I'm making freezer food
to last until April.


101
0:6:36,897 --> 0:6:38,94
You know how the microwave works?


102
0:6:38,94 --> 0:6:41,651
It's a magnetron
that converts electricity...


103
0:6:41,651 --> 0:6:45,3
- No, no, no. Like on, off?
-Yeah, yeah.


104
0:6:45,3 --> 0:6:48,7
What am I doing? I'm packing you off
to some mountainous wasteland,


105
0:6:48,7 --> 0:6:51,202
while I'm stuck here looking for a job.


106
0:6:51,202 --> 0:6:54,39
it'll happen,
as long as you keep trying.


107
0:6:54,39 --> 0:6:56,917
- But you're only 19.
-Exactly! I'm 19.


108
0:6:56,917 --> 0:6:59,2
Lt% Austria. Hardly a wasteland.


109
0:6:59,2 --> 0:7:2,172
Austria. Famous for
"The Sound of Music", breaded food


110
0:7:2,172 --> 0:7:4,925
and the invention of psychoanalysis.
You join the dots.


111
0:7:4,925 --> 0:7:9,804
You Te such a freak.
No wonder nobody will hire you.


112
0:7:9,804 --> 0:7:13,16
- And you won't forget to have a bath?
- Every month.


113
0:7:13,16 --> 0:7:45,382
I give up.


114
0:7:45,382 --> 0:7:47,759
And what exactly am I
supposed to do with this?


115
0:7:47,759 --> 0:7:50,261
- What is it?
- You can't live on beans on toast.


116
0:7:50,261 --> 0:7:53,306
We won two world wars
and one World Cup on beans on toast,


117
0:7:53,306 --> 0:7:54,557
so don't knock 'em.


118
0:7:54,557 --> 0:7:57,644
I've set it up online,
so you'll get a delivery every week.


119
0:7:57,644 --> 0:8:1,22
Lexi, this is my health-freak dad, Bill.
Bill, this is Lexi.


120
0:8:1,22 --> 0:8:3,775
I'm trusting you to keep him alive
till I get back, OK?


121
0:8:3,775 --> 0:8:6,152
- Shit.


122
0:8:6,152 --> 0:8:8,154
My pay goes into the mortgage account.


123
0:8:8,154 --> 0:8:10,49
I'll send any tips back.
Any envelopes...


124
0:8:10,49 --> 0:8:15,37
Big red letters. I know.
Now hurry up, you'll miss your train.


125
0:8:15,37 --> 0:8:24,587
- Maybe this isn't a great idea.
- Go, now.


126
0:8:24,587 --> 0:8:30,51
- I love you, Kimberley.
-I love you, William.


127
0:8:30,51 --> 0:8:36,933
Bye, Dad.


128
0:8:36,933 --> 0:8:52,991
- See you later. Auf Wiedersehen.


129
0:8:52,991 --> 0:8:56,995
Oh, my God, I'm never doing that again!
I can't remember the whole night.


130
0:8:56,995 --> 0:8:58,872
Honestly.


131
0:8:58,872 --> 0:9:2,542
Oh, my God, did you see that guy
staring at my tits the whole night?


132
0:9:2,542 --> 0:9:3,96
It was so awkward.


133
0:9:3,96 --> 0:9:8,214
He was such a perv. And he had a hairy
chest and everything. Can you imagine?


134
0:9:8,214 --> 0:9:11,217
Yeah.


135
0:9:11,217 --> 0:9:18,391
Can I call you back, babes?


136
0:9:18,391 --> 0:9:22,771
- Seriously?
- Yep.


137
0:9:22,771 --> 0:9:35,742
OK, let's go. Put your bags
in the back and get in.


138
0:9:35,742 --> 0:9:42,665
Shit.


139
0:9:42,665 --> 0:9:45,543
Oh, my God, they're huge.


140
0:9:45,543 --> 0:9:50,173
Yeah, they're mountains.
Huge is part of the concept.


141
0:9:50,173 --> 0:9:53,426
You don't even ski, do you?
What are you doing here?


142
0:9:53,426 --> 0:10:13,196
- it's a job. I need to earn money.
- Earn? What, as in, like, "save"?


143
0:10:13,196 --> 0:10:15,865
- Oh.
- Thought I recognised that arse.


144
0:10:15,865 --> 0:10:19,619
- Alright, ugly. You coming out?
- Yeah. Just dumping the new girl off.


145
0:10:19,619 --> 0:10:23,164
- The new girl! Let me see.
- Kim, Jules. Jules, Kim.


146
0:10:23,164 --> 0:10:29,295
- Hi.
- Hi.


147
0:10:29,295 --> 0:10:51,276
- I'll see you later, babes.
- See you later, babes.


148
0:10:51,276 --> 0:10:53,319
it's a bit poky, isn't it?


149
0:10:53,319 --> 0:10:56,322
So is this guy
head of some evil criminal empire?


150
0:10:56,322 --> 0:10:58,908
- He's a banker.
- That's a yes, then.


151
0:10:58,908 --> 0:11:0,952
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?


152
0:11:0,952 --> 0:11:3,79
This is the best job in the Alps.


153
0:11:3,79 --> 0:11:6,833
They use the place to entertain clients
plus a few family weekends.


154
0:11:6,833 --> 0:11:9,377
Apart from that,
they're hardly ever here.


155
0:11:9,377 --> 0:11:14,174
I had 30 girls texting me after Milly
broke her leg, begging me for the job.


156
0:11:14,174 --> 0:11:17,51
But the agency said it had to be
someone they'd seen.


157
0:11:17,51 --> 0:11:20,513
You know what's really funny is,
I wasn't going to take it at first.


158
0:11:20,513 --> 0:11:23,683
OK, maybe not really funny but...


159
0:11:23,683 --> 0:11:27,27
Do what I tell you and if
you're not up to it, I will tell them.


160
0:11:27,27 --> 0:11:30,231
Listen, a week ago I was
mopping up puke in a burger bar.


161
0:11:30,231 --> 0:11:36,7
No, you listen, little Miss Essex
no-coat, non-skiing freak show.


162
0:11:36,7 --> 0:11:37,947
I'm not actually from...


163
0:11:37,947 --> 0:11:41,576
The Madsens fly in at five.
They expect perfection from the start.


164
0:11:41,576 --> 0:11:46,122
Now, if you screw up or, more
importantly, if you make me look bad,


165
0:11:46,122 --> 0:11:51,85
then clearing up puke will be a fond
memory of the good old days. Got it?


166
0:11:51,85 --> 0:11:54,172
Oh!


167
0:11:54,172 --> 0:11:57,383
Got it.


168
0:11:57,383 --> 0:12:18,196
So I'll just make myself at home, then.


169
0:12:18,196 --> 0:12:20,73
J' Farmer in my own farm


170
0:12:20,73 --> 0:12:23,993
I In, out and far


171
0:12:23,993 --> 0:13:22,802
I From the high ceilings


172
0:13:22,802 --> 0:13:52,248
- Look out!
- Hey!


173
0:13:52,248 --> 0:13:53,958
it's a total nightmare.


174
0:13:53,958 --> 0:13:56,794
It's not like you've got to spend
the next four months


175
0:13:56,794 --> 0:13:58,546
sharing a room with her.


176
0:13:58,546 --> 0:14:2,717
- Oh, no, wait, you have.
- I'm serious, babes.


177
0:14:2,717 --> 0:14:6,888
It's like she's never seen snow before.
it's like she's from Africa.


178
0:14:6,888 --> 0:14:10,391
A chalet girl who can't ski.
That's classic.


179
0:14:10,391 --> 0:14:19,525
- Tell me about it. Later, babes.
- Later, babes.


180
0:14:19,525 --> 0:14:22,28
The three golden rules
of chalet-girling.


181
0:14:22,28 --> 0:14:24,238
One, no friends up in the chalet.


182
0:14:24,238 --> 0:14:28,826
Two, party all you like, as long as
breakfast is on the table at eight.


183
0:14:28,826 --> 0:14:32,747
- You oversleep, you pack your bags.
- Friends, breakfast, check.


184
0:14:32,747 --> 0:14:35,291
Three, no sleeping with the clients.


185
0:14:35,291 --> 0:14:39,42
Unless they're fit. Or minted.
Or hitting on you.


186
0:14:39,42 --> 0:14:45,51
- Basically, there's only two rules.
- Basically, yeah.


187
0:14:45,51 --> 0:14:48,12
We're just going to get
the essentials for now.


188
0:14:48,12 --> 0:14:50,98
Right, so shall I go and get the veg?


189
0:14:50,98 --> 0:14:53,434
Six tins of caviar, please. Beluga.


190
0:14:53,434 --> 0:14:56,938
Caviar, right. Of course.


191
0:14:56,938 --> 0:15:0,358
I'm more front-of-house type,
you're more back office.


192
0:15:0,358 --> 0:15:2,235
Because I know how to talk to them.


193
0:15:2,235 --> 0:15:6,364
Yeah, I don't speak much posh.
Dropped it after GCSEs.


194
0:15:6,364 --> 0:15:9,325
- Do you want to prep the veg?
-I live to prep veg.


195
0:15:9,325 --> 0:15:11,911
Right, carrots,
we've got a big game coming up.


196
0:15:11,911 --> 0:15:15,456
I want to see each and every one of you
giving 110 per cent.


197
0:15:15,456 --> 0:15:17,25
Are you done?


198
0:15:17,25 --> 0:15:19,836
Yeah. I thought you said
they landed at five.


199
0:15:19,836 --> 0:15:22,88
I did. But the pilot called.
They ran into some headwind.


200
0:15:22,88 --> 0:15:27,51
Oh, right... The who called?


201
0:15:27,51 --> 0:15:30,12
-God, he's here already.
-Who?


202
0:15:30,12 --> 0:15:36,394
The owners' all-round ski guide,
fixer and gimp.


203
0:15:36,394 --> 0:15:40,731
Kim, meet the very handsome,
very powerful Bernhardt.


204
0:15:40,731 --> 0:15:45,695
- You're late.
- Did I mention very charming too?


205
0:15:45,695 --> 0:15:50,74
- Is this the new Hausmédchen?
- Hi.


206
0:15:50,74 --> 0:15:55,746
Hey, welcome!


207
0:15:55,746 --> 0:16:0,543
- So, who is everyone?
- Oh, you'll figure it out.


208
0:16:0,543 --> 0:16:10,178
You know, you're going to have to stop
being so helpful all the time.


209
0:16:10,178 --> 0:16:13,431
Rule three. Anyway, he's taken.


210
0:16:13,431 --> 0:16:17,59
- Turned you down, did he?
- No.


211
0:16:17,59 --> 0:16:22,648
So, what's the deal?
How do I, you know, talk to them?


212
0:16:22,648 --> 0:16:28,112
You don't talk to them.
You don't look them directly in the eye.


213
0:16:28,112 --> 0:16:31,115
- And curtsey when you meet them.
- Oh.


214
0:16:31,115 --> 0:16:34,285
- Alright, needle cock?
- You old slapper.


215
0:16:34,285 --> 0:16:38,247
- You OK down there?
- Yeah, yeah, just... stretching.


216
0:16:38,247 --> 0:16:42,793
- Right. Is this the new helper?
- Er, something like that.


217
0:16:42,793 --> 0:16:44,629
Hi, rm Kim.


218
0:16:44,629 --> 0:16:47,423
Jonny. And I don't actually have
a needle cock.


219
0:16:47,423 --> 0:16:51,26
- He did when he was ten.
- Hey.


220
0:16:51,26 --> 0:16:53,429
I'm so excited to be back! Hi!


221
0:16:53,429 --> 0:16:55,765
- Hey, Chloe.
- How are you?


222
0:16:55,765 --> 0:16:58,559
- This is Milly's replacement, Kate.
- Kim.


223
0:16:58,559 --> 0:17:1,2
This heartbreaker is her brother Nigel.


224
0:17:1,2 --> 0:17:5,441
- Nigel. The famous Nigel.
- He really does have a tiny cock.


225
0:17:5,441 --> 0:17:12,281
Hey, it's not what you got,
it's about where you put it in...


226
0:17:12,281 --> 0:17:14,534
Please ignore him.


227
0:17:14,534 --> 0:17:16,994
This is my dad Richard,
"Call me Dickie."


228
0:17:16,994 --> 0:17:18,538
Are you following this?


229
0:17:18,538 --> 0:17:21,374
- Dad, this is Kim.
- Call me Dickie.


230
0:17:21,374 --> 0:17:24,669
Thank you for stepping in.
Just do whatever Georgie does.


231
0:17:24,669 --> 0:17:26,504
Except that thing with her chin.


232
0:17:26,504 --> 0:17:29,6
- We liked that, didn't we?
- That was a one-off.


233
0:17:29,6 --> 0:17:31,842
- Speaking of one-offs...
- Hey!


234
0:17:31,842 --> 0:17:33,469
Hello.


235
0:17:33,469 --> 0:17:38,15
This is my wife Caroline.


236
0:17:38,15 --> 0:17:41,185
Who apparently has a throat infection.


237
0:17:41,185 --> 0:17:45,856
- Help us with the bags?
- Ah, yes.


238
0:17:45,856 --> 0:17:47,817
- Ahem.
- Give her a chance.


239
0:17:47,817 --> 0:17:57,76
I didn't say anything.


240
0:17:57,76 --> 0:18:4,875
And lovingly topped off
with gravy, é Ia me.


241
0:18:4,875 --> 0:18:7,795
Back office.


242
0:18:7,795 --> 0:18:12,925
Wouldn't want to steal your thunder
with the sprouts.


243
0:18:12,925 --> 0:18:26,48
Oh, brilliant. Look at that!


244
0:18:26,48 --> 0:18:37,992
Ibble dibble number one, with 12 ibble
dibbles calls ibble dibble number...


245
0:18:37,992 --> 0:18:40,953
There. Right there.


246
0:18:40,953 --> 0:18:45,791
Mmm! I want to be a profiterole.


247
0:18:45,791 --> 0:18:47,835
So these guys fly in on a private jet


248
0:18:47,835 --> 0:18:51,422
and their idea of fun is rubbing
a burnt cork on each ether's faces?


249
0:18:51,422 --> 0:18:53,132
That's insane.


250
0:18:53,132 --> 0:18:59,805
Sanity's overrated.
Tried it once, didn't get it.


251
0:18:59,805 --> 0:19:1,557
Join in. We don't bite.


252
0:19:1,557 --> 0:19:5,311
Well, my mum bites a bit. The rest of us
just nibble ibble dibble...


253
0:19:5,311 --> 0:19:6,896
Talking crap.


254
0:19:6,896 --> 0:19:9,523
- You! it's time.
- No, there's absolutely no way.


255
0:19:9,523 --> 0:19:13,819
- Yes! Yes!
-I don't want to!


256
0:19:13,819 --> 0:19:16,864
Georgie! Georgie! Georgie! Georgie!


257
0:19:16,864 --> 0:19:19,33
OK, OK.


258
0:19:19,33 --> 0:19:23,913
Hark! The Herald.


259
0:19:23,913 --> 0:19:37,93
Ooh.


260
0:19:37,93 --> 0:19:39,929
- Go, go, go.
- Oh, Nigel.


261
0:19:39,929 --> 0:19:44,642
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


262
0:19:44,642 --> 0:19:48,104
See now, this is my idea of fun.
You should join in.


263
0:19:48,104 --> 0:19:51,107
J' Hark! The herald angels sing


264
0:19:51,107 --> 0:19:57,363
Unfortunately I'm only grade one
at... whatever that is.


265
0:19:57,363 --> 0:19:59,156
Yeah!


266
0:19:59,156 --> 0:20:2,952
- You eating alright?
- Five a day. How's it going?


267
0:20:2,952 --> 0:20:5,705
- It's fine.
- What are the people like?


268
0:20:5,705 --> 0:20:7,79
- They're...


269
0:20:7,79 --> 0:20:9,75
Who wants more champagne?


270
0:20:9,75 --> 0:20:11,502
..fine.


271
0:20:11,502 --> 0:20:14,964
If it doesn't work out, I can
always nick one of their paintings.


272
0:20:14,964 --> 0:20:17,91
- What's that noise?


273
0:20:17,91 --> 0:20:19,593
Oh, nothing, er...


274
0:20:19,593 --> 0:20:23,597
No, it's next door.
There's a truck reversing,


275
0:20:23,597 --> 0:20:27,17
I think.


276
0:20:27,17 --> 0:20:29,353
Listen, Kimmy,


277
0:20:29,353 --> 0:20:31,21
I really miss you, you know?


278
0:20:31,21 --> 0:20:41,574
I know, Dad. Me too.


279
0:20:41,574 --> 0:20:45,786
Georgie? Georgie?


280
0:20:45,786 --> 0:20:51,83
It's seven.


281
0:20:51,83 --> 0:20:59,925
Rule two?


282
0:20:59,925 --> 0:21:2,636
- Is this caviar?
- Sure looks like it.


283
0:21:2,636 --> 0:21:9,477
Well, dig in, everyone,
and enjoy your $300 omelettes.


284
0:21:9,477 --> 0:21:14,94
Jesus, Kim. You have to wake me.
I don't need you making me look bad.


285
0:21:14,94 --> 0:21:17,443
- No kidding.


286
0:21:17,443 --> 0:21:20,196
So what am I supposed
to do all day, then?


287
0:21:20,196 --> 0:21:54,814
I don't know. I'm sure
you'll find something. Look around.


288
0:21:54,814 --> 0:21:57,191
Oh, shit.


289
0:21:57,191 --> 0:22:17,44
Wait! Stop!


290
0:22:17,44 --> 0:22:19,755
- Georgie, this cake is supreme.
- Thank you, Jonny.


291
0:22:19,755 --> 0:22:21,882
Hm-hmm! Sure is.


292
0:22:21,882 --> 0:22:24,969
- This place is so magical.
- It is when you're here.


293
0:22:24,969 --> 0:22:28,222
Enjoy it. You won't ski this much
when you're starting a family.


294
0:22:28,222 --> 0:22:31,559
- Do I get a say in any of this?
- No, snoogles, you don't.


295
0:22:31,559 --> 0:22:35,271
I'm not sure I'm ready for any of this.
Do I look like a grandfather?


296
0:22:35,271 --> 0:22:39,66
- Don't answer that!


297
0:22:39,66 --> 0:22:44,738
Thank you. Ooh.


298
0:22:44,738 --> 0:23:2,47
That's hot!


299
0:23:2,47 --> 0:23:7,219
I Angels watching over me
with smiles upon their face


300
0:23:7,219 --> 0:23:12,474
J' Cos I have made it through this far
in an unforgiving place


301
0:23:12,474 --> 0:23:18,314
J' it feels sometimes this hill's
too steep for a girl like me to climb


302
0:23:18,314 --> 0:23:21,25
I But I must knock those thoughts
right down


303
0:23:21,25 --> 0:23:23,152
I I'll do it in my own time


304
0:23:23,152 --> 0:23:25,29
J* I don't care


305
0:23:25,29 --> 0:23:28,616
I I?n halfway there


306
0:23:28,616 --> 0:23:38,125
J* On a road that leads me
straight to who knows where


307
0:23:38,125 --> 0:23:40,794
You crazy freak!
Watch where you're going!


308
0:23:40,794 --> 0:23:42,671
I'm so sorry. Sorry.


309
0:23:42,671 --> 0:23:45,716
Stay safe, Betty Boop.
Hang outside on the ripside!


310
0:23:45,716 --> 0:23:52,848
- Yeah, and in English?
- Hang outside on the ripside.


311
0:23:52,848 --> 0:23:54,183
Ciao!


312
0:23:54,183 --> 0:23:56,518

0:23:56,518 --> 0:23:59,396

322
0:24:23,504 --> 0:24:29,969
J' Come on and try a little topsy-tun/y
back-to-front the right way round


323
0:24:29,969 --> 0:24:32,68
You blow at boarding.
But you sure are styley.


324
0:24:32,68 --> 0:24:40,187
I'll take it you're not
into pink all-in-ones?


325
0:24:40,187 --> 0:24:47,69
- Mikki. Single guy from Finland.
- Kim. Not interested from England.


326
0:24:47,69 --> 0:24:49,989
- You know the skateboarding?
- A bit.


327
0:24:49,989 --> 0:24:54,66
Same, same, but different.
You want some help?


328
0:24:54,66 --> 0:25:0,165
- Yeah.
- OK, come on, get up.


329
0:25:0,165 --> 0:25:4,962
OK, in skateboarding, weight back.
In snowboarding, weight centred.


330
0:25:4,962 --> 0:25:8,59
OK. Right.


331
0:25:8,59 --> 0:25:13,22
- Knees.
- OK.


332
0:25:13,22 --> 0:25:16,974
Turn with your shoulders,
not the knees.


333
0:25:16,974 --> 0:25:19,143
You're a natural.


334
0:25:19,143 --> 0:25:21,61
It's like skateboarding, huh?


335
0:25:21,61 --> 0:25:25,357
Whoo-hoo!


336
0:25:25,357 --> 0:25:28,277
- That was pretty cool.
- That was nothing, Betty.


337
0:25:28,277 --> 0:25:30,195
Let's get high.


338
0:25:30,195 --> 0:25:31,864
UP-


339
0:25:31,864 --> 0:25:35,2
Oh. No, I can't. I'm on the budget tour.


340
0:25:35,2 --> 0:25:48,922
Betty... Follow me.


341
0:25:48,922 --> 0:25:52,593
Hey, look. That's the biggest
snowboarding competition in Tyrol.


342
0:25:52,593 --> 0:25:56,513
Every year I enter,
every year I face-plant.


343
0:25:56,513 --> 0:25:58,766
But this year I rock it!


344
0:25:58,766 --> 0:26:1,143
Hey, we'll enter together.


345
0:26:1,143 --> 0:26:3,52
Why? Because I'm such a pro boarder?


346
0:26:3,52 --> 0:26:5,814
Three months, maybe.


347
0:26:5,814 --> 0:26:8,65
Maybe, maybe not.


348
0:26:8,65 --> 0:26:12,654
Come on. $25,000. it's easy for you.
You're a skateboarder.


349
0:26:12,654 --> 0:26:15,783
I pulled a 360 my first day on a board.


350
0:26:15,783 --> 0:26:20,454
And broke your neck, right?
-No. My leg.


351
0:26:20,454 --> 0:26:23,248
Just so you know,
I've given Jonny your mother's ring.


352
0:26:23,248 --> 0:26:27,169
That's a coincidence. I've given him
one of her dresses. He'll look lovely.


353
0:26:27,169 --> 0:26:30,5
It is not funny.
The marquee is pencilled for June.


354
0:26:30,5 --> 0:26:32,966
It was quite funny.


355
0:26:32,966 --> 0:26:37,221
Didn't you get the message?
You're joining us. Dress up.


356
0:26:37,221 --> 0:26:38,972
I... did.


357
0:26:38,972 --> 0:26:41,16
Don't worry. She made me change too.


358
0:26:41,16 --> 0:26:47,439
Drainpipe jeans and winkle-pickers
aren't very this season apparently.


359
0:26:47,439 --> 0:26:49,608
You were never a style guru.


360
0:26:49,608 --> 0:26:53,779
I was.


361
0:26:53,779 --> 0:26:56,115
Lippy.


362
0:26:56,115 --> 0:26:57,658
Liner.


363
0:26:57,658 --> 0:26:59,326
Lashes.


364
0:26:59,326 --> 0:27:1,411
Accessories.


365
0:27:1,411 --> 0:27:2,913
I want those back.


366
0:27:2,913 --> 0:27:6,166
And... hair gum. Use sparingly.


367
0:27:6,166 --> 0:27:17,136
Hair gum?


368
0:27:17,136 --> 0:27:18,887
And like that, she became a swan.


369
0:27:18,887 --> 0:27:20,973
So I used to be an ugly duckling, then?


370
0:27:20,973 --> 0:27:25,269
Someone needs to learn
how to take a compliment.


371
0:27:25,269 --> 0:27:34,653
- Ah, it all makes sense now.
- Yeah. I'm just back office.


372
0:27:34,653 --> 0:27:37,823
- It's a shoelace.
- Er, it's bow tie.


373
0:27:37,823 --> 0:27:46,331
No, it's a shoelace knot. Come here.


374
0:27:46,331 --> 0:27:49,835
Didn't think you'd be the kind of girl
who knew how to tie a bow tie.


375
0:27:49,835 --> 0:27:58,427
And here's me thinking
you were the kind of boy who would.


376
0:27:58,427 --> 0:28:8,437
Big night for you, then?


377
0:28:8,437 --> 0:28:10,856
There.


378
0:28:10,856 --> 0:28:14,61
Licensed to kill.


379
0:28:14,61 --> 0:28:26,997
- Or be killed.


380
0:28:26,997 --> 0:28:31,21
Right, who needs a drink?


381
0:28:31,21 --> 0:28:36,256
- Oh, Georgie. What are these?
- Mini-burgers. Don't blame me.


382
0:28:36,256 --> 0:28:39,134
They are sensational.


383
0:28:39,134 --> 0:28:41,929
- Trying to get me drunk?
- Just helping you on your way.


384
0:28:41,929 --> 0:28:43,972
Greasing your nuts, as it were.


385
0:28:43,972 --> 0:28:47,935
- Rule three?
- Oh, shut up.


386
0:28:47,935 --> 0:28:50,62
What are you grinning at?


387
0:28:50,62 --> 0:28:53,398
Nothing. Just think
I'm starting to get the hang of this.


388
0:28:53,398 --> 0:28:57,486
The cake's on the oven. The beef
is nearly done. And the mousse has set.


389
0:28:57,486 --> 0:29:1,74
Oh, thank you.


390
0:29:1,74 --> 0:29:3,825
Thank you.


391
0:29:3,825 --> 0:29:6,703
- Wow. Did you hear what...
- Yeah, don't get used to it.


392
0:29:6,703 --> 0:29:8,789
Get a fresh one of these.


393
0:29:8,789 --> 0:29:11,5
Such responsibility.
Do I get a performance star?


394
0:29:11,5 --> 0:29:23,679
- What?
- Doesn't matter.


395
0:29:23,679 --> 0:29:32,145
Chloe, you look wonderful.


396
0:29:32,145 --> 0:29:36,9
Oh, look. Looks like the new girl's
putting on pre-dinner entertainment.


397
0:29:36,9 --> 0:29:39,528
Oh, dear, stand back.


398
0:29:39,528 --> 0:29:44,992
Kim, wait. Kim...


399
0:29:44,992 --> 0:29:53,625
What a waste. That's vintage.


400
0:29:53,625 --> 0:29:57,129
Doctor's orders. The good news is,
you've already got the headache,


401
0:29:57,129 --> 0:29:59,6
so you can drink as much as you like.


402
0:29:59,6 --> 0:30:1,591
- I should go and help Georgie.
- I wouldn't worry.


403
0:30:1,591 --> 0:30:9,641
- I think Nigel has her covered.
- Thanks.


404
0:30:9,641 --> 0:30:14,479
- Hit the spot.
- Yeah, it should. '62 Dom.


405
0:30:14,479 --> 0:30:17,899
- Dom?
- It's 500 quid a bottle.


406
0:30:17,899 --> 0:30:24,406
500? Think I'll just take the cash
next time.


407
0:30:24,406 --> 0:30:27,75
Why am I here?
I'm stuck in a parallel reality


408
0:30:27,75 --> 0:30:29,995
where people drink my monthly salary
every ten minutes.


409
0:30:29,995 --> 0:30:34,624
You're right. We're aliens.
My mother has a tail. Did you see it?


410
0:30:34,624 --> 0:30:37,2
Your mum is the scariest woman
I've ever met.


411
0:30:37,2 --> 0:30:40,464
You want to know how she met
my dad? Air stewardess. Concorde.


412
0:30:40,464 --> 0:30:44,885
Your dad was an air stewardess?


413
0:30:44,885 --> 0:30:49,56
She's not that scary.


414
0:30:49,56 --> 0:30:51,16
Well, look, I should be getting back.


415
0:30:51,16 --> 0:30:57,898
Yeah, of course. Thanks for the Dom.


416
0:30:57,898 --> 0:31:12,537
Yeah.


417
0:31:12,537 --> 0:31:14,539
Can we talk about this later?


418
0:31:14,539 --> 0:31:17,793
She won't wait forever, Jonny.


419
0:31:17,793 --> 0:31:21,922
I feel so sorry for her.


420
0:31:21,922 --> 0:31:26,301
See?


421
0:31:26,301 --> 0:31:28,261
- Thank you.
- Everything alright?


422
0:31:28,261 --> 0:31:32,57
Yeah, everything's fine.
We'll be back out in February.


423
0:31:32,57 --> 0:31:35,519
See if you can figure out the whole
champagne-bottle thing by then.


424
0:31:35,519 --> 0:31:40,482
- Yep, I will practise daily.
- Knock yourself out.


425
0:31:40,482 --> 0:31:43,652
Trying to shake your hand,
punch you in the stomach. Not cool.


426
0:31:43,652 --> 0:31:47,114
So, I'll put the photos on Facebook.


427
0:31:47,114 --> 0:31:51,34
Well,... poke me.


428
0:31:51,34 --> 0:31:53,537
Right. OK, girls.


429
0:31:53,537 --> 0:31:57,124
This is for all your hard work.
Thank you so much.


430
0:31:57,124 --> 0:32:0,21
And, Kim, you know you get
a lift pass too, don't you?


431
0:32:0,21 --> 0:32:4,881
Just charge it to the chalet.
Unless you'd prefer the cash.


432
0:32:4,881 --> 0:32:7,217
- Lift pass would be great.
- OK.


433
0:32:7,217 --> 0:32:10,262
- Alright, let's go.
- It's a private plane. It can wait.


434
0:32:10,262 --> 0:32:13,98
- It will. I won't.
- Desperate to get back to work.


435
0:32:13,98 --> 0:32:16,17
OK, maybe I'll quit,
and next time we can hitchhike here.


436
0:32:16,17 --> 0:32:24,776
A father-son adventure.
I like the sound of that. Bye.


437
0:32:24,776 --> 0:32:27,529
- "Poke me"?
- Piss off.


438
0:32:27,529 --> 0:32:30,532
Slut.


439
0:32:30,532 --> 0:32:33,243
- 200-euro tip for one week?


440
0:32:33,243 --> 0:32:35,162
Are you sure you're just cooking?


441
0:32:35,162 --> 0:32:39,833
I'll put it in the bank when I can.
You OK?


442
0:32:39,833 --> 0:32:41,751
- Yeah. Solid.
- Huh?


443
0:32:41,751 --> 0:32:43,753
I mean sound, yeah.


444
0:32:43,753 --> 0:32:59,352
- Don't let them work you too hard.
- I won't.


445
0:32:59,352 --> 0:33:2,272
Right, Finland, let's do this.
Where do we start?


446
0:33:2,272 --> 0:33:7,486
Well, in slopestyle, you are scored
on your tricks on the rails,


447
0:33:7,486 --> 0:33:9,279
and the jump you pull at the end.


448
0:33:9,279 --> 0:33:14,701
- You smell me?
- Yes, I smell you. Unfortunately.


449
0:33:14,701 --> 0:33:22,0
Think about the run. Only the run.
Be the board.


450
0:33:22,0 --> 0:33:30,8
Let's get tricky with Mikki!


451
0:33:30,8 --> 0:33:52,572
Right, come on, Kim.


452
0:33:52,572 --> 0:33:59,454
Yes!


453
0:33:59,454 --> 0:34:2,82
- Hey.
- Hey.


454
0:34:2,82 --> 0:34:6,419
You do realise you're riding a beginner
board from, like, the 16th century?


455
0:34:6,419 --> 0:34:10,6
I thought the 16th century
was the golden age of snowboarding.


456
0:34:10,6 --> 0:34:12,968
Go to the rental shop
and pick yourself up a park board.


457
0:34:12,968 --> 0:34:15,22
You'll have more fun on that, trust me.


458
0:34:15,22 --> 0:34:20,517
And ask for Willy. Tell him
Tara sent you. He'll hook you up.


459
0:34:20,517 --> 0:34:23,436
Stay safe out there.


460
0:34:23,436 --> 0:34:36,741
Thanks.


461
0:34:36,741 --> 0:34:39,369
Kann ich dir helfen?


462
0:34:39,369 --> 0:34:41,83
Oh, I'm just looking, thanks.


463
0:34:41,83 --> 0:34:46,751
Rentals are only 80 euros a week,
and half-price for staff.


464
0:34:46,751 --> 0:34:51,89
Well, I'm staff. And actually,
Tara told me to come by.


465
0:34:51,89 --> 0:34:54,9
OK, fine. 30.


466
0:34:54,9 --> 0:35:9,316
Freestyle board, boots and helmet.
You get top end for that.


467
0:35:9,316 --> 0:35:13,278
Cool. Deal.


468
0:35:13,278 --> 0:35:17,73
J* For such a long time


469
0:35:17,73 --> 0:35:20,702
J* We've been standing in line


470
0:35:20,702 --> 0:35:24,456
.P And it's been so long


471
0:35:24,456 --> 0:35:33,923
Whoo!


472
0:35:33,923 --> 0:35:37,177
- Georgie!
- Hey!


473
0:35:37,177 --> 0:35:39,179
Check it out! That's your buddy, Kim.


474
0:35:39,179 --> 0:35:41,765
Whoo!


475
0:35:41,765 --> 0:35:44,851
I thought you said she hadn't been
in the mountains before.


476
0:35:44,851 --> 0:35:46,561
She hadn't.


477
0:35:46,561 --> 0:35:47,687
I Far away with me


478
0:35:47,687 --> 0:35:49,814
J* You will never know


479
0:35:49,814 --> 0:35:52,817
Hey, Kimmy.
I've got my first interview tomorrow.


480
0:35:52,817 --> 0:35:57,53
And, well, I'm being a good boy and
going through the statements, but I saw


481
0:35:57,53 --> 0:36:0,325
that tip money hasn't gone in.
it's probably their fault


482
0:36:0,325 --> 0:36:2,202
but I just thought I'd let you know.


483
0:36:2,202 --> 0:36:7,54
And, hey, Kimmy, aubergines. Whoo!
My new favourite food. Who knew?


484
0:36:7,54 --> 0:36:24,974
Alright, Kimmy, love you.


485
0:36:24,974 --> 0:36:56,506
- Didn't hear you get up.
- I haven't.


486
0:36:56,506 --> 0:37:3,388
Level nine! Yeah, baby.


487
0:37:3,388 --> 0:37:5,765
You really think
you're going to win that pro?


488
0:37:5,765 --> 0:37:7,392
N-N-No.


489
0:37:7,392 --> 0:37:9,477
Hallo!


490
0:37:9,477 --> 0:37:12,564
Abend. Friulein.


491
0:37:12,564 --> 0:37:15,942
- Hey, Bernie.
- What's with the towel, Bernie?


492
0:37:15,942 --> 0:37:20,155
My name is Bernhardt. Mr Madsen,
he asked me to test the hot tub.


493
0:37:20,155 --> 0:37:23,324
- Did he now?
- Jawohl.


494
0:37:23,324 --> 0:37:28,79
There is, you must know,
room for more than just one.


495
0:37:28,79 --> 0:37:30,832
That is so funny,


496
0:37:30,832 --> 0:37:33,209
because Kim and I were just saying


497
0:37:33,209 --> 0:37:36,4
how much we would love
to share a hot tub with Bernhardt.


498
0:37:36,4 --> 0:37:39,632
- For sure?
- Yeah.


499
0:37:39,632 --> 0:37:43,178
But the problem is,
we don't have our swimsuits.


500
0:37:43,178 --> 0:37:46,97
Who needs swimsuits?


501
0:37:46,97 --> 0:37:48,975
Yeah, Kim, who needs swimsuits?


502
0:37:48,975 --> 0:37:50,935
You are so right.


503
0:37:50,935 --> 0:37:53,646
Maybe when we're out there
you could give me a back rub.


504
0:37:53,646 --> 0:37:57,65
And then we can, like,
frolic naked in the snow!


505
0:37:57,65 --> 0:38:4,282
Yeah.


506
0:38:4,282 --> 0:38:9,871
Ah! I understand.
The famous English humour.


507
0:38:9,871 --> 0:38:20,89
I forget.


508
0:38:20,89 --> 0:38:21,758
Stop snowing!


509
0:38:21,758 --> 0:38:24,844
I You cannot change this


510
0:38:24,844 --> 0:38:29,808
J* We are not going back


511
0:38:29,808 --> 0:38:46,783
I Yeah


512
0:38:46,783 --> 0:38:54,791
Yes!


513
0:38:54,791 --> 0:38:56,751
it's your birthday?


514
0:38:56,751 --> 0:39:7,846
What makes you think that?


515
0:39:7,846 --> 0:39:11,391
You want to look at anything else?
Bank statements, knicker drawer?


516
0:39:11,391 --> 0:39:14,686
- Bertie's. Now.
- I'm can't, I'm saving.


517
0:39:14,686 --> 0:39:17,272
I thought you were
just about to win $25,000.


518
0:39:17,272 --> 0:39:20,441
I don't think you need to save.
Come on.


519
0:39:20,441 --> 0:39:22,36
No, Georgie. I'm not going.


520
0:39:22,36 --> 0:39:25,405
Betty in the house!


521
0:39:25,405 --> 0:39:28,241
You owe me ten euros, G.
She bet me you'd never come in.


522
0:39:28,241 --> 0:39:32,704
She says you were too much of a...
How you say? Chav? What is a chav?


523
0:39:32,704 --> 0:39:34,747
Yeah, Georgie, what is a chav?


524
0:39:34,747 --> 0:39:37,834
I didn't... His English is awful.


525
0:39:37,834 --> 0:39:40,128
Buy yourself some vegetables.


526
0:39:40,128 --> 0:39:42,5
Hey, Willy. This is Kim.


527
0:39:42,5 --> 0:39:45,842
We already met. Tara says
you look sweet on the freestyle.


528
0:39:45,842 --> 0:39:48,136
Do you know who that is?


529
0:39:48,136 --> 0:39:50,889
- Yeah. It's Tara.
- Tara Dakides!


530
0:39:50,889 --> 0:39:53,516
She won, like,
1,000 X Games medals.


531
0:39:53,516 --> 0:39:56,811
First chick in the world
to pull a backside rodeo, right, Willy?


532
0:39:56,811 --> 0:39:59,22
Broke her back
in three places learning it.


533
0:39:59,22 --> 0:40:1,524
Now she needs a painkiller
every time she rides.


534
0:40:1,524 --> 0:40:4,944
- Insane. What is she doing here?
- The Roxy. Her big comeback.


535
0:40:4,944 --> 0:40:6,863
She reckons this girl has game.


536
0:40:6,863 --> 0:40:11,576
I taught her everything she knows!


537
0:40:11,576 --> 0:40:13,369
- Alright.
-Yeah.


538
0:40:13,369 --> 0:40:18,458
Happy birthday! Blow out your candles!


539
0:40:18,458 --> 0:40:36,976
Whoo-hoo!


540
0:40:36,976 --> 0:40:40,647
J' Come away with me,
far away with me


541
0:40:40,647 --> 0:40:46,861
I You will never know until you go


542
0:40:46,861 --> 0:40:52,116
J' When will you go?


543
0:40:52,116 --> 0:40:55,703
J' Fly away with me,
just leave the gravity


544
0:40:55,703 --> 0:40:58,289
.P it's all just for show


545
0:40:58,289 --> 0:41:2,21
J' When will you go?


546
0:41:2,21 --> 0:41:6,172
I Just let go


547
0:41:6,172 --> 0:41:10,134
J* For such a long time


548
0:41:10,134 --> 0:41:13,888
J* We've been standing in line


549
0:41:13,888 --> 0:41:17,642
I it% been so long


550
0:41:17,642 --> 0:41:21,145
- it's just a few. Come on.
- But it's rule number one.


551
0:41:21,145 --> 0:41:25,984
The night is young, and so are we.


552
0:41:25,984 --> 0:41:35,41
Just a few.


553
0:41:35,41 --> 0:41:38,204
- This is your fault.
- You are welcome.


554
0:41:38,204 --> 0:41:42,5
Oh, come on!


555
0:41:42,5 --> 0:41:47,505
- Little Finnish lunatic.
- How long have you been together?


556
0:41:47,505 --> 0:41:57,223
- Oh, we're not together.
- My balls are ice cream!


557
0:41:57,223 --> 0:42:0,56
Argh.


558
0:42:0,56 --> 0:42:3,62
Chillout.


559
0:42:3,62 --> 0:42:6,399
Chill out, chill out, chill out,


560
0:42:6,399 --> 0:42:13,656
chill out, chill out, chill out,
chill out, chill out, chill out!


561
0:42:13,656 --> 0:42:54,822
Chill out, chill out, chill out,
chill out, chill out, chill out!


562
0:42:54,822 --> 0:42:56,157
You here all season?


563
0:42:56,157 --> 0:42:58,367
- Jimmy's going home.
- Don't tempt me.


564
0:42:58,367 --> 0:43:2,955
There's a broken coffee table in
the hall, the speaker system is kaput,


565
0:43:2,955 --> 0:43:5,583
and vomit on the yucca plant.


566
0:43:5,583 --> 0:43:8,86
Excellent work, girls.


567
0:43:8,86 --> 0:43:20,807
Just as long as nobody painted
a comedy moustache on the...


568
0:43:20,807 --> 0:43:24,102
OK, look, just clean up the mess,
I'll replace the kit,


569
0:43:24,102 --> 0:43:26,896
you pay me back later.
We'll take it out of your tips.


570
0:43:26,896 --> 0:43:29,816
- But what's happened...
- They don't need to know.


571
0:43:29,816 --> 0:43:33,569
I don't understand why they would
do this if they knew we were coming.


572
0:43:33,569 --> 0:43:35,655
- You told them, right?
- Ja, sicher.


573
0:43:35,655 --> 0:43:39,992
Jawohl. I say Mr Jonny come early
because of the good snow.


574
0:43:39,992 --> 0:43:41,994
- No, no, no, he didn't!
- You didn't!


575
0:43:41,994 --> 0:43:47,83
-I did.
- Awesome sauna, bro.


576
0:43:47,83 --> 0:43:50,837
OK, erm... You do not get
to call me needle cock ever again.


577
0:43:50,837 --> 0:43:54,882
And you, next time you have a birthday
party, do it at your own house.


578
0:43:54,882 --> 0:43:57,51
Yeah, yeah, a few rounds of Twister,


579
0:43:57,51 --> 0:43:59,554
a couple of games of gin rummy
and we're away.


580
0:43:59,554 --> 0:44:1,764
- Great.
- Pop round if you're in the area.


581
0:44:1,764 --> 0:44:7,895
- Maybe I will.
- Cool.


582
0:44:7,895 --> 0:44:14,11
Er, breakfast at eight. OK?


583
0:44:14,11 --> 0:44:20,116
Better luck next time, Scheisskopt


584
0:44:20,116 --> 0:44:22,91
- Kim?
- Georgie?


585
0:44:22,91 --> 0:44:29,83
You're really going to have
to win that competition now.


586
0:44:29,83 --> 0:44:37,3
- Yep.


587
0:44:37,3 --> 0:44:39,886
Come on, babes.


588
0:44:39,886 --> 0:44:45,725
First day of the season.


589
0:44:45,725 --> 0:44:52,64
See you later. Try not to organise
any mass raves while we're out.


590
0:44:52,64 --> 0:45:0,823
I I?n not Mr Muscle but I can
be loathsome and I can hustle you


591
0:45:0,823 --> 0:45:4,911
Look, Dad. I'll speak to you later.
I've really got to go. Love you.


592
0:45:4,911 --> 0:45:12,793
Bye'


593
0:45:12,793 --> 0:45:21,928
Come on.


594
0:45:21,928 --> 0:45:26,515
- Hi.
- Hi.


595
0:45:26,515 --> 0:45:27,6
Ill


596
0:45:27,6 --> 0:45:30,436
Jesus, have you slept
with half the bloody resort?


597
0:45:30,436 --> 0:45:33,981
- Only the useful half.
-I can be useful.


598
0:45:33,981 --> 0:45:38,152
I I?n not Mr Muscle but I can
be loathsome and I can hustle you


599
0:45:38,152 --> 0:45:40,196
J' I'm not Mr Muscle
but I can be loathsome


600
0:45:40,196 --> 0:45:43,282
Is it true chalet girls
all have sex in gondolas?


601
0:45:43,282 --> 0:45:46,77
Oh, yeah. Non-stop.
We are crazy for it.


602
0:45:46,77 --> 0:45:47,87
Come on, can't people see in?


603
0:45:47,87 --> 0:45:50,81
The windows steam up
if you do it right.


604
0:45:50,81 --> 0:45:54,335
Yep. On this one you only have
90 seconds. No time for foreplay.


605
0:45:54,335 --> 0:45:56,337
90 seconds is Nige's record.


606
0:45:56,337 --> 0:46:1,384
- I still think I can do better.
- OK, sister present.


607
0:46:1,384 --> 0:46:4,804
- Check out the fresh tracks.
-Wow.


608
0:46:4,804 --> 0:46:7,223
- The Yeti.
- The who?


609
0:46:7,223 --> 0:46:9,976
Not really a Yeti.
Just some local mystery guy.


610
0:46:9,976 --> 0:46:12,895
He's always first to put fresh tracks
down the powder.


611
0:46:12,895 --> 0:46:15,898
- You know he's a guy because...
- Local mystery person.


612
0:46:15,898 --> 0:46:19,902
He, she, they climb through the night,
ski down at dawn. Pretty amazing.


613
0:46:19,902 --> 0:46:23,781
Amazing I weird.


614
0:46:23,781 --> 0:46:36,127
I'd love to have sex in a gondola.


615
0:46:36,127 --> 0:46:39,88
You girls want to come ski with us?
Bernhardt told me about this empty run.


616
0:46:39,88 --> 0:46:42,91
I'm sure they have things
they want to do.


617
0:46:42,91 --> 0:46:46,95
- I'm meeting someone at the snowpark.
- Worried you can't keep up, huh?


618
0:46:46,95 --> 0:47:23,341
- We'll see about that.


619
0:47:23,341 --> 0:47:43,444
Hey. Over here!


620
0:47:43,444 --> 0:48:5,883
Come on. Your turn to jump.


621
0:48:5,883 --> 0:48:14,225
You OK?


622
0:48:14,225 --> 0:48:16,685
Chloe. Chloe, wait!


623
0:48:16,685 --> 0:48:24,61
No, Chloe please don't! Chloe.


624
0:48:24,61 --> 0:48:28,322
- Does it hurt?
- Of course it f ricking hurts, idiot!


625
0:48:28,322 --> 0:48:33,786
OK, give her some more
of that strong stuff. Yeah.


626
0:48:33,786 --> 0:48:36,372
- I feel bad.
- So you should. It's all your fault.


627
0:48:36,372 --> 0:48:37,957
I'm joking. it's really not.


628
0:48:37,957 --> 0:48:41,544
I'll get her back to London
this afternoon. We know a good surgeon.


629
0:48:41,544 --> 0:48:44,296
I'll back out in a couple of weeks
with some clients.


630
0:48:44,296 --> 0:48:47,216
So I'll see you then, then.


631
0:48:47,216 --> 0:49:7,278
Then.


632
0:49:7,278 --> 0:49:15,202
Three! Two! One!


633
0:49:15,202 --> 0:49:19,54
- I need help.
- Me too.


634
0:49:19,54 --> 0:49:21,792
Taking big jumps, lesson one.


635
0:49:21,792 --> 0:49:35,55
It's complex, so watch close.


636
0:49:35,55 --> 0:49:41,61
Jump into my arms, Betty!


637
0:49:41,61 --> 0:49:43,647
Betty Boop? You there?


638
0:49:43,647 --> 0:50:2,5
- Betty?


639
0:50:2,5 --> 0:50:7,213
What's wrong?


640
0:50:7,213 --> 0:50:11,5
Betty, jumping is easy.


641
0:50:11,5 --> 0:50:13,219
Landing is the hard bit.


642
0:50:13,219 --> 0:50:23,687
Come on.


643
0:50:23,687 --> 0:50:26,69
- You ready?
- Yeah.


644
0:50:26,69 --> 0:50:49,505
On three. Three!


645
0:50:49,505 --> 0:50:55,302
Yeah!


646
0:50:55,302 --> 0:50:59,64
J' Chicken! Pay the chicken back back,
pay the chicken back


647
0:50:59,64 --> 0:51:3,18
I Pay back the chicken back,
do the chicken payback


648
0:51:3,18 --> 0:51:6,272
I Piggy! Pay the piggy back back,
pay the piggy back


649
0:51:6,272 --> 0:51:9,65
J' Pay back the piggy back,
do the piggy payback


650
0:51:9,65 --> 0:51:12,611
J' Monkey! Pay the monkey back back,
pay the monkey back


651
0:51:12,611 --> 0:51:15,781
J' See the monkey, do the monkey,
pay the monkey back


652
0:51:15,781 --> 0:51:23,831
Slamdownl Yes!


653
0:51:23,831 --> 0:51:27,167
- My flying angel!
- Ow!


654
0:51:27,167 --> 0:51:30,963
- Are you really going to go for it?
- Yeah. This girl is a podgy.


655
0:51:30,963 --> 0:51:34,675
- She's a what...?
- Podgy. She's a real podgy.


656
0:51:34,675 --> 0:51:36,677
I'm not podgy!


657
0:51:36,677 --> 0:51:38,637
Oh, prodigy.


658
0:51:38,637 --> 0:51:42,6
Hey, Nigel, my sexy beast!
How are you?


659
0:51:42,6 --> 0:51:43,934
Nigel?


660
0:51:43,934 --> 0:51:46,562
Hey, Kim! What's up?


661
0:51:46,562 --> 0:51:49,982
Hey. Hey, Tara, erm...


662
0:51:49,982 --> 0:51:53,319
Just... taking a break.


663
0:51:53,319 --> 0:51:59,825
Well, like they say, if it were easy...


664
0:51:59,825 --> 0:52:4,538
You guys ready? Let's go.


665
0:52:4,538 --> 0:52:7,124
Right, come on, buster.


666
0:52:7,124 --> 0:52:23,641
It's been a long day, Betty.
Take it easy.


667
0:52:23,641 --> 0:52:26,226
Hey, watch and learn, my friend!


668
0:52:26,226 --> 0:52:35,235
Betty, wait up! it's too soon!


669
0:52:35,235 --> 0:52:54,505
Whoa!


670
0:52:54,505 --> 0:52:59,51
I think that's enough carrots.


671
0:52:59,51 --> 0:53:2,12
Why give up now
after you've worked so hard?


672
0:53:2,12 --> 0:53:6,266
- Because I don't feel like it, OK?
- It's just a sprain.


673
0:53:6,266 --> 0:53:8,894
This time. Then next time
I break my neck. Then what?


674
0:53:8,894 --> 0:53:10,771
People die doing this stuff.


675
0:53:10,771 --> 0:53:12,856
- I thought you needed the money.
- I do.


676
0:53:12,856 --> 0:53:15,67
Maybe if I hadn't spent it
renting ski kit


677
0:53:15,67 --> 0:53:18,612
and replacing stupid speakers,
which we haven't paid for yet...


678
0:53:18,612 --> 0:53:30,541
Jesus, Kim,
we're meant to be having fun.


679
0:53:30,541 --> 0:53:37,214
Hello, this is Kim Matthews"s phone.
Leave a message after the tone. Bye!


680
0:53:37,214 --> 0:53:39,717
Cheer up, babe. It might never happen.


681
0:53:39,717 --> 0:53:43,345
It has. It continues to.


682
0:53:43,345 --> 0:53:46,306
Do you know what you need to do?


683
0:53:46,306 --> 0:53:48,16
Drink bleach? Good idea.


684
0:53:48,16 --> 0:53:50,519
Two capfuls. Bucket. Hot water.


685
0:53:50,519 --> 0:53:59,737
You know what they say, don't you?
Tidy kitchen, tidy mind.


686
0:53:59,737 --> 0:54:2,114
I just feel like I'm losing her.


687
0:54:2,114 --> 0:54:6,535
People change. Change is good.


688
0:54:6,535 --> 0:54:9,621
Where's her mum, then?


689
0:54:9,621 --> 0:54:19,882
Sutton Row Cemetery.
Change isn't always good.


690
0:54:19,882 --> 0:54:24,136
Two capfuls?


691
0:54:24,136 --> 0:54:28,849
Yo-ho, snow-ho!


692
0:54:28,849 --> 0:54:32,269
- How's your arm?
- it's alright. it's getting there.


693
0:54:32,269 --> 0:54:34,438
The doctor said it'll be fine
in a few days.


694
0:54:34,438 --> 0:54:37,733
Oh. Wow, she can talk to me now,
right?


695
0:54:37,733 --> 0:54:40,694
Now that Captain America
isn't calling her 50 times a day.


696
0:54:40,694 --> 0:54:44,656
I need my training buddy. They started
building the course for the pro.


697
0:54:44,656 --> 0:54:47,785
- You wanna take a sneaky peeky?
- No, I can't.


698
0:54:47,785 --> 0:54:50,579
We've got corporate guests.
Big weekend.


699
0:54:50,579 --> 0:54:56,502
One hour? You've got to do this.


700
0:54:56,502 --> 0:55:0,672
Betty, you on a board,
it's where you're meant to be.


701
0:55:0,672 --> 0:55:6,637
You've got so much talent
it's unfair on the rest of us, so why...


702
0:55:6,637 --> 0:55:10,474
Betty...


703
0:55:10,474 --> 0:55:22,611
Sorry, Mikki. I can't.


704
0:55:22,611 --> 0:55:28,659
Bye.


705
0:55:28,659 --> 0:55:30,786
- Thank you, Kate.
- Dad, her name's Kim.


706
0:55:30,786 --> 0:55:34,623
Where's that one from last year, Dickie?
Really big tits, big arse?


707
0:55:34,623 --> 0:55:36,959
Henry Goodwin?
He went bust, didn't you hear?


708
0:55:36,959 --> 0:55:39,628
- You prick! The chalet girl.
- Milly broke her leg.


709
0:55:39,628 --> 0:55:41,88
- What, skiing?
- Aprés-skiing.


710
0:55:41,88 --> 0:55:45,467
You're too lean for my taste.
We'll have to fatten you up, love.


711
0:55:45,467 --> 0:55:50,597
Yeah, a bit more cushion
for the pushin'.


712
0:55:50,597 --> 0:55:52,724
- They tip well.
- They'd better.


713
0:55:52,724 --> 0:55:54,643
We need Malcolm to come in first.


714
0:55:54,643 --> 0:55:57,437
40 mill, 50 maybe.
The others will follow.


715
0:55:57,437 --> 0:55:59,815
- You worry too much.
- You don't worry enough.


716
0:55:59,815 --> 0:56:3,11
Dickie, shift your arse!
- Right. Let's get going.


717
0:56:3,11 --> 0:56:5,821
Georgie, you're coming with us
to dish up lunch?


718
0:56:5,821 --> 0:56:9,74
Erm, actually I've come down
with something.


719
0:56:9,74 --> 0:56:14,162
It's like a little tickle.
It's like...


720
0:56:14,162 --> 0:56:17,4
Oh. Well, you'd better come,
then, erm...


721
0:56:17,4 --> 0:56:19,501
- Oh, Dad, for God's sake, it's Kim.
- Kim.


722
0:56:19,501 --> 0:56:22,87
No, I should be...


723
0:56:22,87 --> 0:56:24,798
Ow.


724
0:56:24,798 --> 0:56:28,969
Fine. I'll get changed
and get my lift pass.


725
0:56:28,969 --> 0:56:31,346
You don't need a lift pass.


726
0:56:31,346 --> 0:56:36,81
How can you not need a lift pass?


727
0:56:36,81 --> 0:56:39,396
Ah.


728
0:56:39,396 --> 0:56:41,273
You ever been
in one of these things?


729
0:56:41,273 --> 0:56:44,151
Yeah, we got one at home.
This one's pretty small.


730
0:56:44,151 --> 0:56:47,487
- Do we pay extra for irony?
- No, the irony's free.


731
0:56:47,487 --> 0:56:50,157
- It's the sarcasm you're paying for.


732
0:56:50,157 --> 0:57:8,926
Ironically.


733
0:57:8,926 --> 0:57:10,469
Oh, wow.


734
0:57:10,469 --> 0:57:14,222
- How long have you been on that thing?
- About eight weeks.


735
0:57:14,222 --> 0:57:16,308
Jesus. Dickie...


736
0:57:16,308 --> 0:57:19,19
You can fly back on the bird
if you're not sure.


737
0:57:19,19 --> 0:57:37,829
- She's fine. Trust me.
- I don't want her holding us up.


738
0:57:37,829 --> 0:57:42,209
The global financial meltdown
just happened to other people, right?


739
0:57:42,209 --> 0:57:46,254
I warned you about sub-primes. Greed
is only good when it comes to lunch.


740
0:57:46,254 --> 0:57:48,924
Speaking of which, what is this?


741
0:57:48,924 --> 0:57:53,971
Special Austrian food.
Strudel, nudel and... kniidel.


742
0:57:53,971 --> 0:57:58,475
I wouldn't mind a "canoodle"
with this one in fact.


743
0:57:58,475 --> 0:58:1,812
Right, nearest the pin, lads.
it's 50s in and it's...


744
0:58:1,812 --> 0:58:3,772
I'm going to go 32C.


745
0:58:3,772 --> 0:58:6,692
It's hard to tell. The jumper
might be bulking her up.


746
0:58:6,692 --> 0:58:8,694
Put me down for a 30B.


747
0:58:8,694 --> 0:58:11,947
Miles off. I'm thinking 30D,
the Holy Grail of bra sizes.


748
0:58:11,947 --> 0:58:15,75
Controversial. Go on, Kimmy,
put us out of our misery.


749
0:58:15,75 --> 0:58:18,12
No, Kim, don't answer that.


750
0:58:18,12 --> 0:58:21,832
I'm sorry. I was under the impression
that we were enjoying ourselves.


751
0:58:21,832 --> 0:58:25,669
Unlike most women you know, Malcolm,
Kim keeps her clothes on for a living.


752
0:58:25,669 --> 0:58:26,92
Oh.


753
0:58:26,92 --> 0:58:28,964
It's alright.
You know what they say.


754
0:58:28,964 --> 0:58:33,76
The bigger the chat,
the smaller the chap.


755
0:58:33,76 --> 0:58:39,599
New game. Waistlines.
Malcolm?


756
0:58:39,599 --> 0:58:41,727
Fantastic weekend, Dickie.


757
0:58:41,727 --> 0:58:44,146
Flattery will get you nowhere


758
0:58:44,146 --> 0:58:50,694
but some fresh powder and a couple of
tasty chalet tarts will get you 40 mill.


759
0:58:50,694 --> 0:58:55,198
- Dad, wait.
- Forgotten your hair-care products?


760
0:58:55,198 --> 0:58:59,77
Actually, I was thinking about staying
a couple more days if it's OK.


761
0:58:59,77 --> 0:59:3,79
Hey, do your thing.
Back for the weekend, obviously?


762
0:59:3,79 --> 0:59:7,419
Yeah, of course.


763
0:59:7,419 --> 0:59:11,6
I'll see you guys soon.


764
0:59:11,6 --> 0:59:14,968
There's, like, 400 euros here.
Should think so too. Bloody perverts.


765
0:59:14,968 --> 0:59:17,304
Jonny didn't ask us
to pay him back for...


766
0:59:17,304 --> 0:59:23,643
Thanks for reminding me.


767
0:59:23,643 --> 0:59:30,275
- Oh, and you. Yes.


768
0:59:30,275 --> 0:59:34,362
OK, so that you can earn yours back,
I want to hire you.


769
0:59:34,362 --> 0:59:37,699
50 euros an hour.


770
0:59:37,699 --> 0:59:42,704
Not like that.


771
0:59:42,704 --> 0:59:45,165
- Need a hand? The meter's running.
- No.


772
0:59:45,165 --> 0:59:48,168
That's three euros right there.
Well, it's your money.


773
0:59:48,168 --> 0:59:50,587
Actually, it's mine now. Again.


774
0:59:50,587 --> 0:59:53,799
Show me what's so great
about boarding. Let's get gnarled.


775
0:59:53,799 --> 0:59:56,635
- Gnarly.
- Whatever. Sick, phat, ill.


776
0:59:56,635 --> 1:0:1,139
You sound like a doctor.


777
1:0:1,139 --> 1:0:8,396
- Holy shit, I'm a natural.
- Shut up, snoogles.


778
1:0:8,396 --> 1:0:10,398
Move back into position.


779
1:0:10,398 --> 1:0:13,276
-Watch this one.
- Now concentrate.


780
1:0:13,276 --> 1:0:15,737
-OK.
- Idiot.


781
1:0:15,737 --> 1:0:21,76
I think you mean, "Concentrate, please,
valued paying customer."


782
1:0:21,76 --> 1:0:24,579
- Oops.
- Owl


783
1:0:24,579 --> 1:0:31,169
- OK, that was an accident.
- I'm not going to be your bit of fun.


784
1:0:31,169 --> 1:0:36,299
-Go on, then.
- Yes, yes, yes.


785
1:0:36,299 --> 1:0:47,686
Come on, loser.
I'll show you how it's done.


786
1:0:47,686 --> 1:0:49,437
Yes!


787
1:0:49,437 --> 1:0:52,983
So you have a pretty rough life, huh?


788
1:0:52,983 --> 1:0:55,861
- Hideous, isn't it?
-I don't know how you stand it.


789
1:0:55,861 --> 1:0:57,696
It's not all it's cracked up to be.


790
1:0:57,696 --> 1:1:2,576
I've heard that having loads of money
can be a real let-down.


791
1:1:2,576 --> 1:1:6,204
You think I could do
anything I want to?


792
1:1:6,204 --> 1:1:10,917
Truth is, my dad's been saving a place
for me on the board since I was two


793
1:1:10,917 --> 1:1:13,712
and my mother won't be happy
until I've married Chloe


794
1:1:13,712 --> 1:1:16,798
and have nine children
with perfect teeth.


795
1:1:16,798 --> 1:1:18,758
They've got it all planned out for me


796
1:1:18,758 --> 1:1:24,639
and I'm, like,
"This is it? This is my life?"


797
1:1:24,639 --> 1:1:27,559
No, nice try, but not quite.


798
1:1:27,559 --> 1:1:30,562
Oh, angst. The rich kid's alternative
to real problems.


799
1:1:30,562 --> 1:1:34,941
Sarcasm. The chalet girl's alternative
to real humour. I know I'm lucky...


800
1:1:34,941 --> 1:1:37,152
"But I'm stuck in this caged existence


801
1:1:37,152 --> 1:1:39,571
of vintage champagne
and luxury ski chalets


802
1:1:39,571 --> 1:1:41,781
when I just want to be a pop star."


803
1:1:41,781 --> 1:1:50,457
Rock star.


804
1:1:50,457 --> 1:1:56,546
- Why don't you just do it, then?
- it's just not that simple.


805
1:1:56,546 --> 1:1:59,549
- What?
- it's nothing.


806
1:1:59,549 --> 1:2:2,219
No, what? Go on.


807
1:2:2,219 --> 1:2:4,721
It's just a bit silly.
My mum always used to say,


808
1:2:4,721 --> 1:2:8,225
"You've got brains in your head,
feet in your shoes."


809
1:2:8,225 --> 1:2:14,397
"You can steer yourself
in any direction you choose."


810
1:2:14,397 --> 1:2:21,529
Clever girl, your mum.


811
1:2:21,529 --> 1:2:24,866
Yeah. We should get going.


812
1:2:24,866 --> 1:2:27,702
Yeah.


813
1:2:27,702 --> 1:2:31,539
I hope you know what you're doing.


814
1:2:31,539 --> 1:2:33,166
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying.


815
1:2:33,166 --> 1:2:37,379
The season ends, he goes back
to his world, you go back to yours.


816
1:2:37,379 --> 1:2:38,755
What are you left with?


817
1:2:38,755 --> 1:2:42,801
My world?
Where exactly is that? Pluto?


818
1:2:42,801 --> 1:2:46,263
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Don't judge me by your standards.


819
1:2:46,263 --> 1:2:48,431
You'd rather be with a rich idiot
like Nigel


820
1:2:48,431 --> 1:2:51,476
instead of Mikki
who you are clearly in love with.


821
1:2:51,476 --> 1:2:55,355
- I'm going for a beer.
- There's something you need to know.


822
1:2:55,355 --> 1:2:59,317
I think I'm done
on the friendly advice for now, thanks.


823
1:2:59,317 --> 1:3:6,616
It'd be better
if you just stay out of it, OK?


824
1:3:6,616 --> 1:3:10,829
Do you want to talk about it?
A barman's cheaper than a shrink.


825
1:3:10,829 --> 1:3:13,748
A beer's cheaper than a barman.


826
1:3:13,748 --> 1:3:40,859
- I'm pretty cheap.
- Beer doesn't talk back either.


827
1:3:40,859 --> 1:3:42,902
Hey. Are you OK?


828
1:3:42,902 --> 1:3:47,866
- She told you where I was, then?
- I'm staying out of it.


829
1:3:47,866 --> 1:3:51,494
Look, about us...


830
1:3:51,494 --> 1:3:54,664
Night, Jonny.


831
1:3:54,664 --> 1:4:0,45
What I really came to say was
I booked the helicopter again.


832
1:4:0,45 --> 1:4:4,299
I need someone to serve me lunch.


833
1:4:4,299 --> 1:4:19,522
You are so annoying.


834
1:4:19,522 --> 1:4:21,24
I I feel sweet


835
1:4:21,24 --> 1:4:23,568
J' Do you feel sweet?


836
1:4:23,568 --> 1:4:29,157
.P It's amazing


837
1:4:29,157 --> 1:4:33,411
J' I have no skin,
and I feel everything


838
1:4:33,411 --> 1:4:39,84
.P It's amazing


839
1:4:39,84 --> 1:4:41,461
I I've wanted this for so long


840
1:4:41,461 --> 1:4:44,47
I Now the deed has been done


841
1:4:44,47 --> 1:4:47,5
I We shall rise with the sun


842
1:4:47,5 --> 1:4:58,603
J' Spend our time as one


843
1:4:58,603 --> 1:5:2,732
I Now there is no sin in anything


844
1:5:2,732 --> 1:5:5,652
.P it's life-changing


845
1:5:5,652 --> 1:5:19,416
J' This feeling


846
1:5:19,416 --> 1:5:26,548
J' This feeling


847
1:5:26,548 --> 1:5:31,428
J' This feeling


848
1:5:31,428 --> 1:5:37,434
.P It's amazing


849
1:5:37,434 --> 1:5:40,61
J* From now on


850
1:5:40,61 --> 1:5:42,564
J* From now on


851
1:5:42,564 --> 1:5:45,15
J* We are one


852
1:5:45,15 --> 1:5:47,402
.P It's amazing


853
1:5:47,402 --> 1:5:50,363
J* it's in the stars, in the sun


854
1:5:50,363 --> 1:5:52,49
.P it's everywhere, in everyone


855
1:5:52,49 --> 1:5:57,162
I And it will be every day


856
1:5:57,162 --> 1:6:1,958
J* From now on


857
1:6:1,958 --> 1:6:4,627
J* We are one


858
1:6:4,627 --> 1:6:7,547
.P It's amazing


859
1:6:7,547 --> 1:6:11,801
It's like pass the parcel.


860
1:6:11,801 --> 1:6:31,321
34B. Knew it.


861
1:6:31,321 --> 1:6:34,532
Wh at?


862
1:6:34,532 --> 1:6:47,587
Nothing.


863
1:6:47,587 --> 1:6:52,55
Would it freak you out if I said
that was the best day of my life?


864
1:6:52,55 --> 1:7:0,808
OK, maybe not the best,
but certainly top... five.


865
1:7:0,808 --> 1:7:3,728
What is with you people
walking in on me naked?


866
1:7:3,728 --> 1:7:7,482
I think the idea was
you stayed below stairs, young lady.


867
1:7:7,482 --> 1:7:13,71
And you, don't you have
an engagement party to go to?


868
1:7:13,71 --> 1:7:18,409
For a second there
I thought she meant...


869
1:7:18,409 --> 1:7:34,551
Oh.


870
1:7:34,551 --> 1:7:36,928
- I did try to tell you.
-it's not hard.


871
1:7:36,928 --> 1:7:39,138
"Did you hear
Jonny proposed to Chloe?"


872
1:7:39,138 --> 1:7:41,307
"No. Thanks for letting me know, chum."


873
1:7:41,307 --> 1:7:43,184
I didn't want to see you get hurt.


874
1:7:43,184 --> 1:7:47,605
Yeah, you just did a spiffing job
all round, didn't you?


875
1:7:47,605 --> 1:7:51,651
She's a chalet girl.
My God, it is such a cliché.


876
1:7:51,651 --> 1:7:54,237
I wouldn't have minded so much
if you were discreet


877
1:7:54,237 --> 1:7:57,949
but Bernhardt said you were all over
each other, on the beginner slope!


878
1:7:57,949 --> 1:8:1,536
Bernhardt could learn a few things
about being discreet himself.


879
1:8:1,536 --> 1:8:4,163
Honey, do you realise
what you're risking here?


880
1:8:4,163 --> 1:8:6,374
You have to stop this right now,
or I will.


881
1:8:6,374 --> 1:8:10,44
This isn't Jane Austen, Mum.
Look, when you and Dad met...


882
1:8:10,44 --> 1:8:13,965
Enough, Jonathan.


883
1:8:13,965 --> 1:8:15,925
I just think you can do better.


884
1:8:15,925 --> 1:8:19,721
Well, I don't think
Dad could have done better.


885
1:8:19,721 --> 1:8:22,932
Look, your father and I, we got lucky.


886
1:8:22,932 --> 1:8:26,144
But believe me,
this girl is only after one thing.


887
1:8:26,144 --> 1:8:28,229
Yeah. And it was great.


888
1:8:28,229 --> 1:8:31,774
- Is there a reason you're still here?
- Look, Kim, can we just...


889
1:8:31,774 --> 1:8:36,696
There's a noise. I can't quite...
Oh, that's right, it's a lying bastard.


890
1:8:36,696 --> 1:8:39,24
Yeah. OK.


891
1:8:39,24 --> 1:8:48,666
Erm, well, look, I owe you...
three hours.


892
1:8:48,666 --> 1:8:49,792
Shit.


893
1:8:49,792 --> 1:8:56,174
Kim! Kim, wait! Kim!


894
1:8:56,174 --> 1:9:12,523
Kim!


895
1:9:12,523 --> 1:9:15,777
About 8:30 tomorrow.
I'll cook you a nice tea to celebrate.


896
1:9:15,777 --> 1:9:18,613
- What about the competition?
-I was never going to win.


897
1:9:18,613 --> 1:9:20,823
It's fine. I can come back
and sort you out.


898
1:9:20,823 --> 1:9:23,951
I've lasted three months.
I'm sure I can manage another week.


899
1:9:23,951 --> 1:9:29,165
Dad, I looked online
at your latest order. 24 tins of beans?


900
1:9:29,165 --> 1:9:31,292
Are you giving up
the chance of a lifetime


901
1:9:31,292 --> 1:9:33,378
because I'm eating
too many baked beans?


902
1:9:33,378 --> 1:9:35,546
Someone's got to take care of you.


903
1:9:35,546 --> 1:9:38,883
Oh, no, you don't.
Don't you dare do that, Kimmy.


904
1:9:38,883 --> 1:9:41,678
Don't you put this on me.
This is your decision.


905
1:9:41,678 --> 1:9:45,556
Anyway, since when did my Kimmy
ever say there was no way


906
1:9:45,556 --> 1:9:47,475
she was gonna win something?


907
1:9:47,475 --> 1:9:51,312
I'll tell you something else, Kimberley.


908
1:9:51,312 --> 1:9:54,774
What, William?


909
1:9:54,774 --> 1:9:58,695
It's what she would have wanted.


910
1:9:58,695 --> 1:10:2,115
Hallo. Was bekommst du?


911
1:10:2,115 --> 1:10:14,585
Erm, what do you want?


912
1:10:14,585 --> 1:10:17,88
It's a beautiful spring morning
here in St Anton,


913
1:10:17,88 --> 1:10:21,509
perfect conditions
for the open qualifiers!


914
1:10:21,509 --> 1:10:29,142
Come on! Come on!


915
1:10:29,142 --> 1:10:32,895
ranks with a kicker.


916
1:10:32,895 --> 1:10:35,64
Mixing things up


917
1:10:35,64 --> 1:10:37,442
and finishing off
with a super styley 540


918
1:10:37,442 --> 1:10:40,862
that should see him through
to the weekend's final.


919
1:10:40,862 --> 1:10:45,533
And there it is, a 73!
That sends Hampton through.


920
1:10:45,533 --> 1:10:50,496
Next up, from Finland, Mikki Niemenan!


921
1:10:50,496 --> 1:10:53,875
- That's you, champ.
- Is Georgie out there?


922
1:10:53,875 --> 1:10:57,712
Well, don't think about her.
Think about the run. Only the run.


923
1:10:57,712 --> 1:11:3,676
Be the board.


924
1:11:3,676 --> 1:11:9,515
Go!


925
1:11:9,515 --> 1:11:13,728
hammers those rails!


926
1:11:13,728 --> 1:11:17,69
Niemenan
showing some impressive skills.


927
1:11:17,69 --> 1:11:20,818
Switch 50-50, backside 180.


928
1:11:20,818 --> 1:11:24,906
Sweet! Coming up to the booter
where he fell last year.


929
1:11:24,906 --> 1:11:27,909
Hits it, going for broke!


930
1:11:27,909 --> 1:11:32,58
Whoa!


931
1:11:32,58 --> 1:11:34,29
And broke it is!


932
1:11:34,29 --> 1:11:39,295
He's up, but he's going to have
a monster headache in the morning.


933
1:11:39,295 --> 1:11:41,547
- You sure you want this?
- Just do it.


934
1:11:41,547 --> 1:11:44,759
And in the ladies' qualifiers now...


935
1:11:44,759 --> 1:11:50,14
Don't worry, it's legal.


936
1:11:50,14 --> 1:11:54,477
- Better than sex too.
- ..Tara Dakides!


937
1:11:54,477 --> 1:11:59,565
A solid 50-50 on the goalpost. Boom!


938
1:11:59,565 --> 1:12:3,319
She spread some butter on the box!


939
1:12:3,319 --> 1:12:8,449
And a frontside seven lean!


940
1:12:8,449 --> 1:12:10,868
A master class from the master!


941
1:12:10,868 --> 1:12:13,371
The Greek goddess!


942
1:12:13,371 --> 1:12:17,458
Whatever, man! She is awesome!


943
1:12:17,458 --> 1:12:20,211
The Queen of Scream is back!


944
1:12:20,211 --> 1:12:23,89
- Ow!
- Now, last up, strapped in,


945
1:12:23,89 --> 1:12:26,968
trying to follow an amazing run,
newcomer Kim Matthews.


946
1:12:26,968 --> 1:12:28,719
Let's see what she has got!


947
1:12:28,719 --> 1:12:34,809
Drei, zwei, eins. Go!


948
1:12:34,809 --> 1:12:38,729
A front 180 to switch tail, a 180 out!


949
1:12:38,729 --> 1:12:41,148
Textbook awesomeness!


950
1:12:41,148 --> 1:12:46,863
A silky tail press. Nice one, Matthews!


951
1:12:46,863 --> 1:12:51,659
Throwing an indy grab
coming off the box!


952
1:12:51,659 --> 1:13:1,878
And here she goes now,
coming up to the big booter!


953
1:13:1,878 --> 1:13:3,546
What's happened there?


954
1:13:3,546 --> 1:13:7,174
She's stopped short
and takes the lame line down.


955
1:13:7,174 --> 1:13:12,93
Kim might have done just enough on the
top section to get into the main event.


956
1:13:12,93 --> 1:13:16,309
Oh, no. 59, just outside qualification.


957
1:13:16,309 --> 1:13:18,644
Kim will be back on finals day,


958
1:13:18,644 --> 1:13:21,23
but she'll have to wait and see
if she gets a ride.


959
1:13:21,23 --> 1:13:23,983
I came 21 st. Yay!


960
1:13:23,983 --> 1:13:26,193
That's great. How many qualify?


961
1:13:26,193 --> 1:13:30,281
The top 20. So, suddenly, not so yay.
I am first reserve though.


962
1:13:30,281 --> 1:13:36,37
- I get a chance if someone pulls out.
- You gave it your best shot though.


963
1:13:36,37 --> 1:13:39,707
- Dad, I've got to go.
- OK, bye.


964
1:13:39,707 --> 1:13:41,459
Bye.


965
1:13:41,459 --> 1:13:44,45
- Finland!


966
1:13:44,45 --> 1:13:46,255
Morphine rules!


967
1:13:46,255 --> 1:13:53,93
It's just ligaments, thank God.


968
1:13:53,93 --> 1:15:12,967
Oh, piss off! Again.


969
1:15:12,967 --> 1:15:19,306
-Hi.


970
1:15:19,306 --> 1:15:23,269
So you are the Yeti.


971
1:15:23,269 --> 1:15:59,638
Must be the hair.


972
1:15:59,638 --> 1:16:6,145
Want to talk about it?


973
1:16:6,145 --> 1:16:9,857
No.


974
1:16:9,857 --> 1:16:23,287
It's just something that...


975
1:16:23,287 --> 1:16:25,331
Er...


976
1:16:25,331 --> 1:16:27,249
We were...


977
1:16:27,249 --> 1:16:29,96
We were driving home, and, erm...


978
1:16:29,96 --> 1:16:31,67
I'd just won the London Trials


979
1:16:31,67 --> 1:16:34,548
and... all of us in the car,


980
1:16:34,548 --> 1:16:36,133
me and my mum and dad,


981
1:16:36,133 --> 1:16:38,469
were singing at the top of our voices


982
1:16:38,469 --> 1:16:41,972
and we were all laughing
cos none of us can sing for shit.


983
1:16:41,972 --> 1:16:45,476
And, erm...


984
1:16:45,476 --> 1:16:47,436
Er...


985
1:16:47,436 --> 1:16:51,816
My dad had to swerve, and...


986
1:16:51,816 --> 1:16:57,488
And he skidded off the road.


987
1:16:57,488 --> 1:17:1,826
And my...


988
1:17:1,826 --> 1:17:8,749
My mum was on the side
that got hit, and...


989
1:17:8,749 --> 1:17:12,92
And she died.


990
1:17:12,92 --> 1:17:19,426
My mum died.


991
1:17:19,426 --> 1:17:33,858
I just really miss her.


992
1:17:33,858 --> 1:17:37,611
Sorry. I'm so sorry.


993
1:17:37,611 --> 1:17:46,871
I always get like this
when I'm around Yetis.


994
1:17:46,871 --> 1:17:51,5
Let's ride.


995
1:17:51,5 --> 1:18:44,303
I always tell the mountains
my problems. They're good listeners.


996
1:18:44,303 --> 1:18:54,313
Two minutes. I'm going to go
and tell the caterers.


997
1:18:54,313 --> 1:18:55,94
Jonathan!


998
1:18:55,94 --> 1:18:58,275
Deidre and I would like to say...


999
1:18:58,275 --> 1:19:0,986
Lord and Lady Marberry,
can I get you another drink?


1000
1:19:0,986 --> 1:19:5,574
Well, why not? Good to see you.


1001
1:19:5,574 --> 1:19:12,748
If you've got to do it, do it now.


1002
1:19:12,748 --> 1:19:18,87
He had it the entire time we were there
and I had no idea. Such a surprise.


1003
1:19:18,87 --> 1:19:21,9
- Excuse me. Can I have a word?
- Yeah.


1004
1:19:21,9 --> 1:19:23,5
Thanks.


1005
1:19:23,5 --> 1:19:26,679
What's up?


1006
1:19:26,679 --> 1:19:30,182
Wh at?


1007
1:19:30,182 --> 1:19:32,476
- What is it?
- Erm...


1008
1:19:32,476 --> 1:19:38,357
I have an idea
that I wanted to run by you.


1009
1:19:38,357 --> 1:19:42,778
How-How would you feel
if we didn't get married?


1010
1:19:42,778 --> 1:19:47,783
How would that sit with you?


1011
1:19:47,783 --> 1:19:54,748
- Good idea.
- Really? You're OK with this?


1012
1:19:54,748 --> 1:19:58,544
Of course I'm not OK with it.


1013
1:19:58,544 --> 1:20:1,672
- Look, I understand it's bad timing.
- Do you really?


1014
1:20:1,672 --> 1:20:5,759
Ending a five-year relationship
in the middle of our engagement party?


1015
1:20:5,759 --> 1:20:11,56
Yes, I think that constitutes
bad timing!


1016
1:20:11,56 --> 1:20:18,689
- I'm sorry, I'm...
- An asshole is what you are!


1017
1:20:18,689 --> 1:20:24,528
Exactly right. I am.


1018
1:20:24,528 --> 1:20:31,535
You're in love with her, aren't you?


1019
1:20:31,535 --> 1:20:45,7
Exactly right. I am.


1020
1:20:45,7 --> 1:20:47,801
Someday I will probably
thank you for this,


1021
1:20:47,801 --> 1:20:53,724
for not going through with it
just to please your mother.


1022
1:20:53,724 --> 1:21:3,567
But today...


1023
1:21:3,567 --> 1:21:8,364
Today, it's not quite how I'm feeling.


1024
1:21:8,364 --> 1:21:14,161
Here, I got you some ice
for the swelling.


1025
1:21:14,161 --> 1:21:20,0
They're gonna blow up.


1026
1:21:20,0 --> 1:21:23,921
Come on, let's go.


1027
1:21:23,921 --> 1:21:26,382
- And for your next trick...
- You're not upset?


1028
1:21:26,382 --> 1:21:28,884
She's lovely, but I trust you.


1029
1:21:28,884 --> 1:21:34,348
- Your mother, on the other hand...
- (wine glass tings)


1030
1:21:34,348 --> 1:21:38,6
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the happy couple.


1031
1:21:38,6 --> 1:21:40,479
In the unlikely event
of an emergency landing,


1032
1:21:40,479 --> 1:21:43,899
the cabin crew will direct you
to the nearest available exit.


1033
1:21:43,899 --> 1:21:45,984
It was like love at first sight.


1034
1:21:45,984 --> 1:21:49,571
They were kids,
if you can believe that.


1035
1:21:49,571 --> 1:21:55,869
OK, baby. Let's get you drunk.


1036
1:21:55,869 --> 1:21:59,832
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!


1037
1:21:59,832 --> 1:22:1,333
Yeah, laters, babe. Yeah.


1038
1:22:1,333 --> 1:22:4,44
Oh, my God!
You guys are never going to believe


1039
1:22:4,44 --> 1:22:5,796
what happened to Jonny and Chloe.


1040
1:22:5,796 --> 1:22:9,883
Apparently there was this major
showdown at their engagement party.


1041
1:22:9,883 --> 1:22:12,636
Hattie says Chloe dumped Jonny
in front of everyone


1042
1:22:12,636 --> 1:22:14,471
and Jonny stormed out.


1043
1:22:14,471 --> 1:22:17,683
But Pips also tweeted that it was
Jonny who broke up with Chloe


1044
1:22:17,683 --> 1:22:20,144
and Chloe just passed out, right there.


1045
1:22:20,144 --> 1:22:29,736
Either way,
it was just super-dramatic, right?


1046
1:22:29,736 --> 1:22:31,572
Wh at?


1047
1:22:31,572 --> 1:22:37,661
I couldn't care less.


1048
1:22:37,661 --> 1:22:43,167
Welcome to Channel 419, broadcasting
live from St Anton, Austria.


1049
1:22:43,167 --> 1:22:45,878
Let's go to our girl on the scene,
Jasmine Kendal.


1050
1:22:45,878 --> 1:22:49,465
So it's finals day here in St Anton,
and one shot is all they get.


1051
1:22:49,465 --> 1:22:52,843
Come on, y'all. Let's make some noise!


1052
1:22:52,843 --> 1:22:56,638
The Roxy Slopestyle Pro! Whoo!


1053
1:22:56,638 --> 1:23:1,518
Come on, let this be the best event in
the history of snowboarding! Let's go!


1054
1:23:1,518 --> 1:23:3,854
Whoo!


1055
1:23:3,854 --> 1:23:6,565
Good luck, Kim.
I hope you get a ride.


1056
1:23:6,565 --> 1:23:9,818
Yeah, well, fingers crossed.


1057
1:23:9,818 --> 1:23:14,72
Thanks, Gunter.


1058
1:23:14,72 --> 1:23:16,2
Whoa, whoa, this area is reserved.


1059
1:23:16,2 --> 1:23:18,452
- Well, I'm the reserve.
- Oh, yes?


1060
1:23:18,452 --> 1:23:21,121
- Your tick here?
- Does it really matter?


1061
1:23:21,121 --> 1:23:26,793
-You're not listening.
-Enough. I'm doing it already.


1062
1:23:26,793 --> 1:23:28,67
Thanks.


1063
1:23:28,67 --> 1:23:32,424
20th qualifier, Anja Schmidt!


1064
1:23:32,424 --> 1:23:36,386
By my count, nice. That's an 84!


1065
1:23:36,386 --> 1:23:40,432
Bethany Loux, getting high!
She's looking good!


1066
1:23:40,432 --> 1:23:43,727
Uh-oh, that bump's gonna cost her.


1067
1:23:43,727 --> 1:23:48,44
Halfway through the competition now,
and this thing is still wide open.


1068
1:23:48,44 --> 1:23:51,401
What's this? A front flip! Yes!


1069
1:23:51,401 --> 1:23:58,7
Awesome-tacularl


1070
1:23:58,7 --> 1:24:2,788
Some major amplitude on that hit! Sick!


1071
1:24:2,788 --> 1:24:7,834
Deep in the final stages.
It is getting tense!


1072
1:24:7,834 --> 1:24:10,921
Oh. And a super-smooth 720.


1073
1:24:10,921 --> 1:24:16,718
That takes Kjersti Buaas
into top spot!


1074
1:24:16,718 --> 1:24:19,471
Final three competitors
to the gate, please.


1075
1:24:19,471 --> 1:24:24,851
Howson, Beal and... Dakides.


1076
1:24:24,851 --> 1:24:28,522
You see, you must have a system
or else everything fails.


1077
1:24:28,522 --> 1:24:33,151
Now, my friend, my work here is done.


1078
1:24:33,151 --> 1:24:35,737
- Hey.
- Just wanted to say good luck.


1079
1:24:35,737 --> 1:24:38,74
Thanks.


1080
1:24:38,74 --> 1:24:41,285
Hey, you killed it in qualifying,
you know that?


1081
1:24:41,285 --> 1:24:45,414
- Up to the point where I screwed up.
- Yeah. Up until then.


1082
1:24:45,414 --> 1:24:49,1
OK, Tara, it's ready.


1083
1:24:49,1 --> 1:24:53,589
- Well, I'll leave you to it.
- Thanks.


1084
1:24:53,589 --> 1:25:11,106
Pretty near perfect yesterday, babe.
What's left to prove?


1085
1:25:11,106 --> 1:25:19,615
Hey, Kim. Come back.


1086
1:25:19,615 --> 1:25:32,85
- You're riding.
- But no one's dropped out.


1087
1:25:32,85 --> 1:25:35,631
Try not to screw up this time, huh?


1088
1:25:35,631 --> 1:25:47,309
Hey, clipboard guy. I'm pulling out.
I gave my bib to Kim.


1089
1:25:47,309 --> 1:25:51,21
- Last up, lead qualifier...
- Hold on.


1090
1:25:51,21 --> 1:25:57,27
Wait... I'm being told that
Tara Dakides has had to pull out.


1091
1:25:57,27 --> 1:26:13,1
Her place is being taken
by Kim Matthews from the UK.


1092
1:26:13,1 --> 1:26:14,92
- Hello?
-Channel 419.


1093
1:26:14,92 --> 1:26:26,39

1:26:46,66 --> 1:26:49,996
Go!


1100
1:26:49,996 --> 1:26:52,416
What channel? Now?


1101
1:26:52,416 --> 1:26:57,963
Cheers, Bill. Les!


1102
1:26:57,963 --> 1:27:4,94
Kim 's coming up to the table.


1103
1:27:4,94 --> 1:27:6,555

1104
1:27:6,555 --> 1:27:9,224
I Hold on


1105
1:27:9,224 --> 1:27:20,444
On the goalpost,
backside boardslide. Nice!


1106
1:27:20,444 --> 1:27:21,528
Yes!


1107
1:27:21,528 --> 1:27:40,672
Now what has she saved up for last?


1108
1:27:40,672 --> 1:27:43,967
J* Hold on, hold on


1109
1:27:43,967 --> 1:27:47,471
I Where we belong


1110
1:27:47,471 --> 1:27:52,476
J* My heart, my song


1111
1:27:52,476 --> 1:27:55,395
J* We stand alone


1112
1:27:55,395 --> 1:28:0,108
I Where we belong


1113
1:28:0,108 --> 1:28:3,111
Switch rodeo 900!


1114
1:28:3,111 --> 1:28:8,283
She is so sweet, my teeth hurt!


1115
1:28:8,283 --> 1:28:17,417
Yes!


1116
1:28:17,417 --> 1:28:19,836
Hey, whoa! Let's stay professional!


1117
1:28:19,836 --> 1:28:24,8
I'm her agent. All offers to me!


1118
1:28:24,8 --> 1:28:27,52
Ow. Ooh. Ow.


1119
1:28:27,52 --> 1:28:29,638
You were amazing, Betty.


1120
1:28:29,638 --> 1:28:31,89
Pull your chequebooks and follow me.


1121
1:28:31,89 --> 1:28:40,23
She's my friend!
I saw her first!


1122
1:28:40,23 --> 1:28:41,942
Congratulations.


1123
1:28:41,942 --> 1:28:46,71
So I guess your hourly rate
just shot through the roof.


1124
1:28:46,71 --> 1:28:49,95
Oh, right. It's the lying bastard.


1125
1:28:49,95 --> 1:28:56,915
- Technically, I never lied to you.
- Withholding-the-truth bastard.


1126
1:28:56,915 --> 1:29:2,546
You hurt me, you know.


1127
1:29:2,546 --> 1:29:5,6
Look...


1128
1:29:5,6 --> 1:29:9,469
I'm sorry. I really am.
You know it's over...


1129
1:29:9,469 --> 1:29:16,518
Things are gonna have to change
now I'm a global snowboarding megastar.


1130
1:29:16,518 --> 1:29:19,855
You're right. You're completely
out of my league.


1131
1:29:19,855 --> 1:29:21,565
Hm-hmm.


1132
1:29:21,565 --> 1:29:25,861
It would be really awkward
if I was always paying for everything.


1133
1:29:25,861 --> 1:29:29,781
I could be a kept man.


1134
1:29:29,781 --> 1:29:34,828
Come here!


1135
1:29:34,828 --> 1:29:37,539
I've never kissed a girl
in a helmet before.


1136
1:29:37,539 --> 1:29:48,3
Safety first.


1137
1:29:48,3 --> 1:29:49,843
Oh, God.


1138
1:29:49,843 --> 1:30:0,2
We don't have a license for that stuff!


1139
1:30:0,2 --> 1:30:1,313
Alright.


1140
1:30:1,313 --> 1:30:8,528
Kim, come up here and get your prize!


1141
1:30:8,528 --> 1:30:12,49

Georgie, from the moment
I laid eyes on you,


1143
1:30:16,494 --> 1:30:18,747
I knew that one day
we would be together


1144
1:30:18,747 --> 1:30:23,1
and now seeing you here I...


1145
1:30:23,1 --> 1:30:26,379

1147
1:30:29,674 --> 1:30:34,22
