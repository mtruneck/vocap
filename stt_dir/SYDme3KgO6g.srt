2
0:0:1,133 --> 0:0:2,901



3
0:0:2,901 --> 0:0:8,334
(Dr. Jaradat)
We live in a world of salt,
but we do not recognize it.


4
0:0:8,334 --> 0:0:11,501
(Dr. Cihacek)
Once it's salinated,
you got a problem.


5
0:0:11,501 --> 0:0:15,601
(Dr. Hopkins)
One of the points that many,
many farmers have said is


6
0:0:15,601 --> 0:0:17,567
that they're seeing salts
in places


7
0:0:17,567 --> 0:0:19,434
that they'd never witnessed
problems before.


8
0:0:19,434 --> 0:0:22,601
(Harold Steppuhn)
If I'm a producer
and on my ground,


9
0:0:22,601 --> 0:0:25,534
I've got a problem with it--
it's not overblown--


10
0:0:25,534 --> 0:0:27,434
that's my livelihood
off that land.


11
0:0:27,434 --> 0:0:31,601



12
0:0:31,601 --> 0:0:34,534
Funding for "Salt of the Earth"


13
0:0:34,534 --> 0:0:38,334
is made possible by an
EPA Section 319 grant


14
0:0:38,334 --> 0:0:41,4
administered by the North Dakota
Department of Health.


15
0:0:41,4 --> 0:0:43,4
the Eastern North Dakota


16
0:0:43,4 --> 0:0:46,33
Resource Conservation
and Development Councils,


17
0:0:46,33 --> 0:0:47,968
with support provided by the...


18
0:0:47,968 --> 0:0:50,267



19
0:0:50,267 --> 0:0:52,467
...helping people help the land,


20
0:0:52,467 --> 0:0:55,634
and by the members
of Prairie Public.


21
0:0:55,634 --> 0:1:0,767



22
0:1:0,767 --> 0:1:2,634
It's a waste of fertilizer,
seed,


23
0:1:2,634 --> 0:1:4,801
and your time and effort on it.


24
0:1:4,801 --> 0:1:10,67
It went from, I would say 5%
to 10% of the farm acres


25
0:1:10,67 --> 0:1:14,367
being affected by salinity to up
to 40% to 50%.


26
0:1:14,367 --> 0:1:18,67
Salinity isn't a new problem,
it's a worldwide problem


27
0:1:18,67 --> 0:1:22,267
(Matt Olien, narrator)
If you've driven by farm fields
in the Upper Great Plains,


28
0:1:22,267 --> 0:1:24,367
you've no doubt noticed
patches of white,


29
0:1:24,367 --> 0:1:26,501
chalky soil,
usually near roads and ditches,


30
0:1:26,501 --> 0:1:28,434
that just doesn't
seem to belong,


31
0:1:28,434 --> 0:1:30,33
and doesn't seem to go away.


32
0:1:30,33 --> 0:1:31,701
Farmers wish it would.


33
0:1:31,701 --> 0:1:34,234
It's soil salinity,
too much salt in the soil,


34
0:1:34,234 --> 0:1:35,901
and it can prove
nearly impossible


35
0:1:35,901 --> 0:1:38,334
to grow a productive crop
in those areas.


36
0:1:38,334 --> 0:1:42,0
Overall reduced soil health,
so compaction issues,


37
0:1:42,0 --> 0:1:44,367
reduced biological activity.


38
0:1:44,367 --> 0:1:46,567
You don't have
as good of soil to till.


39
0:1:46,567 --> 0:1:48,234
It's harder to work the soil.


40
0:1:48,234 --> 0:1:50,267
A lot of that depends on your
strategies


41
0:1:50,267 --> 0:1:52,67
you're using for management--
if you're using


42
0:1:52,67 --> 0:1:54,67
conventional tillage
or no till or strip till.


43
0:1:54,67 --> 0:1:55,934
But it really depends
on the producer


44
0:1:55,934 --> 0:1:57,534
and what they're willing to try.


45
0:1:57,534 --> 0:2:0,133
In my area I would say


46
0:2:0,133 --> 0:2:3,67
over 95% of my fields have
salinity,


47
0:2:3,67 --> 0:2:5,567
and 80% of them have
visible white spots


48
0:2:5,567 --> 0:2:7,467
that are well in excess of this.


49
0:2:7,467 --> 0:2:10,33
All of my producers
are very concerned about it


50
0:2:10,33 --> 0:2:13,167
and are actively looking for
answers and trying new things


51
0:2:13,167 --> 0:2:15,2
and trying to seed
some cover crops,


52
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:17,734
trying some crop rotations,
trying some limited drainage


53
0:2:17,734 --> 0:2:19,501
when they can get
the permission.


54
0:2:19,501 --> 0:2:22,634
So the producer is going
to try to pick the crop


55
0:2:22,634 --> 0:2:25,2
that gives him the best option
and economic return.


56
0:2:25,2 --> 0:2:27,234
(narrator)
Excess Salinity
is caused generally


57
0:2:27,234 --> 0:2:30,868
by too wet of conditions
resulting in a high water table.


58
0:2:30,868 --> 0:2:33,467
Most agree the problem
in the Upper Great Plains


59
0:2:33,467 --> 0:2:35,1
got worse around 1993


60
0:2:35,1 --> 0:2:38,968
when the dry cycle converted to
a wet cycle and has never left.


61
0:2:38,968 --> 0:2:42,901
But the problem has been around
for centuries.


62
0:2:42,901 --> 0:2:47,267
(Dr. Jaradat) The land
in Mesopotamia is very flat,


63
0:2:47,267 --> 0:2:50,67
and irrigating that land
created problems


64
0:2:50,67 --> 0:2:53,367
in addition to the high
temperature


65
0:2:53,367 --> 0:2:56,968
and high evaporation from
the irrigated water.


66
0:2:56,968 --> 0:3:0,834
Salts became concentrated,
and the irrigation water


67
0:3:0,834 --> 0:3:5,667
coming from the twin rivers,
the Tigris and Euphrates,


68
0:3:5,667 --> 0:3:9,968
enriched that salt
in the Mesopotamia plain,


69
0:3:9,968 --> 0:3:12,868
and in less than 1500 years,


70
0:3:12,868 --> 0:3:15,234
the problems started showing up


71
0:3:15,234 --> 0:3:18,601
to the point that
most fertile parts


72
0:3:18,601 --> 0:3:21,934
of lower Mesopotamia
turned into white crusts.


73
0:3:21,934 --> 0:3:24,567
People went hungry,
and cities


74
0:3:24,567 --> 0:3:27,334
and the empires themselves
crumbled


75
0:3:27,334 --> 0:3:31,33
because of the loss
of their wealth.


76
0:3:31,33 --> 0:3:32,801
(Dr. Cihacek) This is a geologic
process


77
0:3:32,801 --> 0:3:35,567
so it's been going on for a long
period of time.


78
0:3:35,567 --> 0:3:37,234
We've got relatively young
glacial soil.


79
0:3:37,234 --> 0:3:40,334
A lot of our soils were pushed
in here by the glaciers,


80
0:3:40,334 --> 0:3:41,934
spread out on the landscape.


81
0:3:41,934 --> 0:3:44,968
So as these salts weather--
they're young materials;


82
0:3:44,968 --> 0:3:48,434
there's a lot of things
to weather in there.


83
0:3:48,434 --> 0:3:51,33
They dissolve
and go into the water.


84
0:3:51,33 --> 0:3:55,334
Then wherever the water goes,
they carry these salt minerals.


85
0:3:55,334 --> 0:3:58,1
(Dr. Abdullah) Although it is
a problem here,


86
0:3:58,1 --> 0:3:59,667
but it's no comparison


87
0:3:59,667 --> 0:4:3,267
to the salinity problem in other
parts of the world.


88
0:4:3,267 --> 0:4:5,767
Just to give you
an example-- California,


89
0:4:5,767 --> 0:4:8,234
the Joaquin Valley
and the Salton Sea.


90
0:4:8,234 --> 0:4:10,434
The problems there are
much bigger.


91
0:4:10,434 --> 0:4:13,133
The world is losing
approximately


92
0:4:13,133 --> 0:4:17,33
a million hectares a year
to salinity,


93
0:4:17,33 --> 0:4:21,2
and there are 200 million
hectares of saline land


94
0:4:21,2 --> 0:4:25,434
which is not producing up
to its productive capacity.


95
0:4:25,434 --> 0:4:28,1
There are issues
in the Nile Delta


96
0:4:28,1 --> 0:4:31,3
especially after the
construction of the Aswan Dam.


97
0:4:31,3 --> 0:4:33,968
After the construction
of the dam,


98
0:4:33,968 --> 0:4:37,133
this kind of natural remedy,
so to speak,


99
0:4:37,133 --> 0:4:44,3
of soil fertility and handling
salinity stopped abruptly.


100
0:4:44,3 --> 0:4:51,467
Based on that, in fact, major
health problems were created.


101
0:4:51,467 --> 0:4:54,701
(narrator)
In our region,
the topography of the land


102
0:4:54,701 --> 0:4:56,767
has lent itself
to salinity problems,


103
0:4:56,767 --> 0:4:59,1
forcing many farmers
to move this land


104
0:4:59,1 --> 0:5:0,834
to the Conservation Reserve
Program.


105
0:5:0,834 --> 0:5:2,701
When the glaciers came
through here,


106
0:5:2,701 --> 0:5:4,601
they ground up to pure shale,


107
0:5:4,601 --> 0:5:8,1
and most of the salinity
that is in our soil


108
0:5:8,1 --> 0:5:9,968
originated
from the pure shale formation


109
0:5:9,968 --> 0:5:12,0
in Eastern North Dakota
at least.


110
0:5:12,0 --> 0:5:14,501
We were just looking
in our training yesterday


111
0:5:14,501 --> 0:5:16,868
at a soil survey
that was completed


112
0:5:16,868 --> 0:5:19,2
in Stutsman County
back in the '80's


113
0:5:19,2 --> 0:5:21,67
before the wet cycle
really started.


114
0:5:21,67 --> 0:5:23,601
There was only,
I think, about 10 acres


115
0:5:23,601 --> 0:5:26,434
of a whole quarter section
that was mapped saline.


116
0:5:26,434 --> 0:5:28,634
I believe that there's
no question


117
0:5:28,634 --> 0:5:31,968
but that some of the salinity
that we're seeing


118
0:5:31,968 --> 0:5:35,234
and the degree and the nature
of the salinity,


119
0:5:35,234 --> 0:5:37,567
it's a function of what we're
doing with water.


120
0:5:37,567 --> 0:5:39,601
It's linked to
the Red River Valley floods.


121
0:5:39,601 --> 0:5:41,267
It's linked to overland flow.


122
0:5:41,267 --> 0:5:42,934
So consequently
what that means is,


123
0:5:42,934 --> 0:5:45,367
is that there's simply
more water on the landscape.


124
0:5:45,367 --> 0:5:48,67
More water either
runs off the landscape.


125
0:5:48,67 --> 0:5:51,2
More water resides within
the landscape, and there's


126
0:5:51,2 --> 0:5:54,734
less water that is moved back
up through evapotranspiration.


127
0:5:54,734 --> 0:5:56,501



128
0:5:56,501 --> 0:5:59,501
It's roughly 10.8


129
0:5:59,501 --> 0:6:2,167
deciSiemens per meter.


130
0:6:2,167 --> 0:6:5,367
And in this type of sampling,


131
0:6:5,367 --> 0:6:7,634
it'll show less salts
'cause we have


132
0:6:7,634 --> 0:6:11,1
a higher concentration of water
with this soil, but that would


133
0:6:11,1 --> 0:6:14,0
easily equate to 25 deciSiemens
on the other methods,


134
0:6:14,0 --> 0:6:17,634
and that is restrictive
to almost all plant growth.


135
0:6:17,634 --> 0:6:20,133
(narrator)
Salinity can be
invisible or visible.


136
0:6:20,133 --> 0:6:23,601
Either way, it is affecting
the bottom line and livelihood


137
0:6:23,601 --> 0:6:26,4
of producers all over
the Upper Great Plains.


138
0:6:26,4 --> 0:6:29,234
Joleen Hadrich with
North Dakota State University


139
0:6:29,234 --> 0:6:31,734
has researched
the economic impact of salinity.


140
0:6:31,734 --> 0:6:35,4
What we know is that their yield
is going to decrease,


141
0:6:35,4 --> 0:6:38,0
and that, of course, is going to
relate


142
0:6:38,0 --> 0:6:40,734
into lower revenues and a lower
profit level.


143
0:6:40,734 --> 0:6:44,467
Slightly saline would result
in about a 15% yield loss.


144
0:6:44,467 --> 0:6:47,33
The moderate
would be 50% yield loss.


145
0:6:47,33 --> 0:6:50,3
When I applied
the average crop prices


146
0:6:50,3 --> 0:6:54,567
that we're receiving right now
in those yield decreases,


147
0:6:54,567 --> 0:6:58,367
it resulted in $150 million
decrease in revenue.


148
0:6:58,367 --> 0:7:2,1
(Bill Schuh)
I think it's first
and foremost a crop problem


149
0:7:2,1 --> 0:7:3,801
and secondly
an economic problem.


150
0:7:3,801 --> 0:7:7,701
The loss of crop yields from
salinization of the soil


151
0:7:7,701 --> 0:7:11,534
is a very, very major economic
loss for our state.


152
0:7:11,534 --> 0:7:14,267
(Joe Breker) I did a recent poll


153
0:7:14,267 --> 0:7:17,901
with our group, our corn growers
group, and it was


154
0:7:17,901 --> 0:7:22,33
fairly common to have producers
from all over the state


155
0:7:22,33 --> 0:7:27,167
that are in the corn growers
that had from 10% to 15%


156
0:7:27,167 --> 0:7:31,0
of their farms
severely impacted by salinity.


157
0:7:31,0 --> 0:7:36,234
In terms of an overall problem,
we could say


158
0:7:36,234 --> 0:7:39,467
that the agricultural land
in Canada,


159
0:7:39,467 --> 0:7:42,234
about 1/3 includes
salt-affected soils.


160
0:7:42,234 --> 0:7:46,968
If I'm a producer,
I will try to minimize that--


161
0:7:46,968 --> 0:7:50,868
any kind of problems
that relate to salinity--


162
0:7:50,868 --> 0:7:53,334
primarily
because my assessed lands,


163
0:7:53,334 --> 0:7:55,968
the assessments, will decrease


164
0:7:55,968 --> 0:7:59,801
if my lands are
identified as salinized.


165
0:7:59,801 --> 0:8:4,567
When we get to an EC of about
8 which is moderately saline,


166
0:8:4,567 --> 0:8:8,33
we have at least 50% reduction
in yields on wheat.


167
0:8:8,33 --> 0:8:11,434
You can have 75% yield loss
on corn,


168
0:8:11,434 --> 0:8:14,133
and soybeans, you might as well
forget it


169
0:8:14,133 --> 0:8:17,834
because we're down to maybe 10%
or not even worth harvesting.


170
0:8:17,834 --> 0:8:19,467
Basically it's an osmotic
problem.


171
0:8:19,467 --> 0:8:22,0
If you get too much salt on
the outside,


172
0:8:22,0 --> 0:8:24,467
you have too much osmotic
suction on the outside,


173
0:8:24,467 --> 0:8:26,801
it competes with the electrolyte
in the plant,


174
0:8:26,801 --> 0:8:29,33
and the plant reaches a point


175
0:8:29,33 --> 0:8:31,0
where it can't imbibe water
properly,


176
0:8:31,0 --> 0:8:32,901
and you start getting yield
reductions.


177
0:8:32,901 --> 0:8:35,67
(narrator) Another fear is
what has happened


178
0:8:35,67 --> 0:8:37,0
in other parts of the world.--


179
0:8:37,0 --> 0:8:39,701
health issues, food supply
issues and water quality issues.


180
0:8:39,701 --> 0:8:44,2
We constantly review the best
available science from EPA


181
0:8:44,2 --> 0:8:47,767
and their contractors that they
work with--universities


182
0:8:47,767 --> 0:8:50,767
that develop the best
toxicological information


183
0:8:50,767 --> 0:8:54,868
that's available to date,
and we incorporate those.


184
0:8:54,868 --> 0:8:58,2
If it's something immediate,
we do it right away


185
0:8:58,2 --> 0:9:0,234
in our water quality standard.


186
0:9:0,234 --> 0:9:4,0
(Bill Schuh) I don't think that
on the basis


187
0:9:4,0 --> 0:9:7,4
of current EPA and CDC documents
we can conclude


188
0:9:7,4 --> 0:9:10,367
that sulphate is particularly
damaging to water quality.


189
0:9:10,367 --> 0:9:12,634
As far as drinking water quality
is concerned,


190
0:9:12,634 --> 0:9:15,868
people drink water that have
a lot of salts in them.


191
0:9:15,868 --> 0:9:18,534
There's a very wide range
of qualities in the waters


192
0:9:18,534 --> 0:9:20,834
that people drink
and are capable of drinking.


193
0:9:20,834 --> 0:9:23,968
Right here in this area of the
field--this is one of


194
0:9:23,968 --> 0:9:26,267
the more obvious places that
you'll see salt.


195
0:9:26,267 --> 0:9:29,267
The obvious effects of the salt
is this white crusting.


196
0:9:29,267 --> 0:9:32,267
I see too many guys trying
to manage their salinity.


197
0:9:32,267 --> 0:9:36,0
They put some into CRP,
but they don't go far enough,


198
0:9:36,0 --> 0:9:38,734
and then that salinity just
continues to move out,


199
0:9:38,734 --> 0:9:42,0
and then they're mad because
they don't have an impact,


200
0:9:42,0 --> 0:9:44,501
and it's just making it worse
and worse.


201
0:9:44,501 --> 0:9:48,67
(narrator)
And as you'll see next, the
solutions farmers come up with


202
0:9:48,67 --> 0:9:49,667
can mean the difference


203
0:9:49,667 --> 0:9:51,467
between lost revenue
and successful yields.


204
0:9:51,467 --> 0:9:55,467



205
0:9:55,467 --> 0:9:59,133
Good management practices
for salinity would include


206
0:9:59,133 --> 0:10:1,2
definitely
CRP, understanding that,


207
0:10:1,2 --> 0:10:3,434
the variable rate and
site specific technologies


208
0:10:3,434 --> 0:10:6,0
is the biggest one
that I'm involved with.


209
0:10:6,0 --> 0:10:8,534
(David Burkland)
Actually in Grand Forks
County here,


210
0:10:8,534 --> 0:10:10,2
the level of salinity is


211
0:10:10,2 --> 0:10:13,67
one of the higher levels
in the Red River Valley


212
0:10:13,67 --> 0:10:15,267
so we've tried
a lot of different things.


213
0:10:15,267 --> 0:10:17,868
We have put some land
into CRP,


214
0:10:17,868 --> 0:10:19,934
but we've done other things too


215
0:10:19,934 --> 0:10:23,234
to try to overcome the saline
conditions--just crop choice


216
0:10:23,234 --> 0:10:25,968
is a big factor,
picking the right crops.


217
0:10:25,968 --> 0:10:29,3
Picking crops that are tolerant
to saline conditions


218
0:10:29,3 --> 0:10:31,334
is real important.


219
0:10:31,334 --> 0:10:34,2
(Shawn Kasprick)
On the precision ag side
of things,


220
0:10:34,2 --> 0:10:35,901
we got different
site-specific products


221
0:10:35,901 --> 0:10:39,33
and services that we can provide
that will give the growers


222
0:10:39,33 --> 0:10:41,1
a handle on
where their salinity is,


223
0:10:41,1 --> 0:10:44,267
what impact it has
on their crop, and how far out


224
0:10:44,267 --> 0:10:46,4
that impact really is
effecting their crop.


225
0:10:46,4 --> 0:10:48,801
That all will wrap up eventually


226
0:10:48,801 --> 0:10:51,501
into a variable rate
application for fertility


227
0:10:51,501 --> 0:10:53,834
and eventually
the grower's bottom line.


228
0:10:53,834 --> 0:10:58,4
(Joe Michels)
It takes a little while to get
established.


229
0:10:58,4 --> 0:11:1,2
It did the job for me.


230
0:11:1,2 --> 0:11:3,534
We have had salinity issues.


231
0:11:3,534 --> 0:11:9,67
There's one hayfield we got
from a fella that got sick.


232
0:11:9,67 --> 0:11:11,434
He told
the landlord that he


233
0:11:11,434 --> 0:11:14,133
wanted to
rent it to my dad


234
0:11:14,133 --> 0:11:16,2
back in
the early 70's.


235
0:11:16,2 --> 0:11:20,467
We took it over;
the ground was white.


236
0:11:20,467 --> 0:11:26,434
It would grow foxtail, kochia,
and not too good at that.


237
0:11:26,434 --> 0:11:28,567
Then the garrison
seemed to help.


238
0:11:28,567 --> 0:11:33,868
It took a long time to
establish, but it is very thick.


239
0:11:33,868 --> 0:11:35,834
We got a good root structure


240
0:11:35,834 --> 0:11:38,901
where Dad could drive
across there with a swather


241
0:11:38,901 --> 0:11:41,367
in the water and not get stuck.


242
0:11:41,367 --> 0:11:44,3
(Dr. Cihacek)
Cover crops, especially
deep-rooted cover crops,


243
0:11:44,3 --> 0:11:48,667
can have an effect on lowering
the water table in an area.


244
0:11:48,667 --> 0:11:52,1
My favorite crop to lower
water tables is alfalfa


245
0:11:52,1 --> 0:11:54,868
which is a perennial,
permanent cover type crop.


246
0:11:54,868 --> 0:11:56,734
Alfalfa is very, very
deep-rooted.


247
0:11:56,734 --> 0:12:0,767
(Hal Weiser)
Out in Montana, they've really
had a lot of success


248
0:12:0,767 --> 0:12:2,434
in addressing saline seeps


249
0:12:2,434 --> 0:12:4,801
and addressing how to correct
those situations.


250
0:12:4,801 --> 0:12:7,33
One thing that's happened-
there's been a shift


251
0:12:7,33 --> 0:12:9,701
in the western part of the state
to no till


252
0:12:9,701 --> 0:12:12,33
so they've gotten a lot more
efficient at water.


253
0:12:12,33 --> 0:12:14,234
A couple of
years ago in 2008,


254
0:12:14,234 --> 0:12:17,167
we did a special initiative
through the Equip Program


255
0:12:17,167 --> 0:12:19,334
which allowed us
to provide cost share


256
0:12:19,334 --> 0:12:22,0
to producers that were having
issues with salinity,


257
0:12:22,0 --> 0:12:24,234
and that was specifically on
saline seeps.


258
0:12:24,234 --> 0:12:27,334
What they wanna see is which
direction the groundwater


259
0:12:27,334 --> 0:12:29,667
is flowing when they start
testing this,


260
0:12:29,667 --> 0:12:32,968
and then they wanna see
the levels of the water.


261
0:12:32,968 --> 0:12:36,601
And as the water goes down, that
means the salts are going down.


262
0:12:36,601 --> 0:12:38,734
The soil on the surface
is more productive


263
0:12:38,734 --> 0:12:41,234
as the salts go lower
into the soil profile.


264
0:12:41,234 --> 0:12:44,634
I can't
honestly say what that piece
of ground looked like before,


265
0:12:44,634 --> 0:12:48,1
but I was out on it
last year on our crop tour,


266
0:12:48,1 --> 0:12:51,534
and like he said, you don't have
the boggy areas out there.


267
0:12:51,534 --> 0:12:54,968
We drove across that with
vehicles with a school bus.


268
0:12:54,968 --> 0:12:57,934
There's good ground cover, and
it's actually very productive.


269
0:12:57,934 --> 0:13:0,434
(Joe Michels) We are able to
seed everything.


270
0:13:0,434 --> 0:13:3,33
If you get
something growing out there,


271
0:13:3,33 --> 0:13:6,701
use up the water,
try to push the salts down.


272
0:13:6,701 --> 0:13:10,3
[motor purrs]


273
0:13:10,3 --> 0:13:14,67
(Paul Overby) So this is
the obvious saline area


274
0:13:14,67 --> 0:13:16,534
where we've got the while soil,


275
0:13:16,534 --> 0:13:18,367
and nothing is growing
except kochia.


276
0:13:18,367 --> 0:13:21,601
So we get back to almost
the same spot every year


277
0:13:21,601 --> 0:13:23,501
so we've not skewing our results


278
0:13:23,501 --> 0:13:26,801
by testing one spot one year
and then two years later


279
0:13:26,801 --> 0:13:28,901
coming back and doing
something that's better.


280
0:13:28,901 --> 0:13:30,801
We're probing the same area.


281
0:13:30,801 --> 0:13:33,601
We've done that consistently now
for four years.


282
0:13:33,601 --> 0:13:37,0
(Paul Overby)
The reality is,
the water tables all over


283
0:13:37,0 --> 0:13:40,901
the Devils Lake Basin are full
to the point of discharging.


284
0:13:40,901 --> 0:13:42,801
We've had years in this area


285
0:13:42,801 --> 0:13:46,33
where I got stuck
on the side of a hill.


286
0:13:46,33 --> 0:13:48,601
What we started doing was
actually developing


287
0:13:48,601 --> 0:13:50,3
zone management for our fields.


288
0:13:50,3 --> 0:13:52,868
That idea intrigued me,
of being able to apply


289
0:13:52,868 --> 0:13:56,367
the right amount of nutrient in
the right parts of your field


290
0:13:56,367 --> 0:13:58,67
to match
the crop yield potential.


291
0:13:58,67 --> 0:14:1,3
We actually use our experience
then to tell the story


292
0:14:1,3 --> 0:14:4,868
as we go out and do seminars
and meet with farmers.


293
0:14:4,868 --> 0:14:8,934
And a lot of farmers are a
little surprised just like I was


294
0:14:8,934 --> 0:14:12,534
that the saline issue was
much bigger than what they see.


295
0:14:12,534 --> 0:14:15,4
Almost every farmer says
well, I turn my fertilizer off


296
0:14:15,4 --> 0:14:17,434
when I go through
those white areas.


297
0:14:17,434 --> 0:14:20,634
I don't fertilize those areas;
I know not to do that.


298
0:14:20,634 --> 0:14:24,734
But they don't realize how far
away the saline issue really is.


299
0:14:24,734 --> 0:14:27,868
And so when we create maps
for those farmers


300
0:14:27,868 --> 0:14:31,334
and then delineate that out,
that makes sense to them.


301
0:14:31,334 --> 0:14:33,133
Then we started the business


302
0:14:33,133 --> 0:14:35,601
of making those maps for
other people,


303
0:14:35,601 --> 0:14:37,701
training people how to use them,


304
0:14:37,701 --> 0:14:40,501
doing seminars for people
and pointing this out.


305
0:14:40,501 --> 0:14:42,534
This is part of the management.


306
0:14:42,534 --> 0:14:45,767
I think the first solution is
(1) recognizing the problem,


307
0:14:45,767 --> 0:14:47,834
and then (2) keeping after it.


308
0:14:47,834 --> 0:14:49,767
It isn't ever gonna go away.


309
0:14:49,767 --> 0:14:52,367
Water moves up and down
in the fields.


310
0:14:52,367 --> 0:14:54,4



311
0:14:54,4 --> 0:14:59,33
We've been doing some work on
this probably going into


312
0:14:59,33 --> 0:15:4,133
our 3rd year now, and certainly
when salinity is really high,


313
0:15:4,133 --> 0:15:7,4
then we get very low,
almost no yield in potatoes.


314
0:15:7,4 --> 0:15:11,634
Especially since 2005, we had a
lot of rain in our area here,


315
0:15:11,634 --> 0:15:15,334
I know just across the line they
had some similar difficulties,


316
0:15:15,334 --> 0:15:18,901
definitely brought more saline
to the surface, and since then


317
0:15:18,901 --> 0:15:21,4
we've had a little bit more


318
0:15:21,4 --> 0:15:23,2
quality problem with our
potatoes.


319
0:15:23,2 --> 0:15:24,868
There's really nothing
that physically,


320
0:15:24,868 --> 0:15:26,901
chemically I should say,
removes salts.


321
0:15:26,901 --> 0:15:29,467
You're not gonna change the
composition of that.


322
0:15:29,467 --> 0:15:33,67
You have to either physically
either drain the salts away


323
0:15:33,67 --> 0:15:35,667
or put in a crop
that can tolerate


324
0:15:35,667 --> 0:15:38,234
the elevated levels
of salt in the soil.


325
0:15:38,234 --> 0:15:41,467



326
0:15:41,467 --> 0:15:43,934
Late '90's, we chose to put


327
0:15:43,934 --> 0:15:48,133
a lot of our most
severely saline land into CRP.


328
0:15:48,133 --> 0:15:49,834
That was a good option.


329
0:15:49,834 --> 0:15:52,734
I mean, that was
an excellent option for us.


330
0:15:52,734 --> 0:15:56,33
So we put
a lot of that land into CRP,


331
0:15:56,33 --> 0:15:59,634
and they used
tall wheat grass, for example.


332
0:15:59,634 --> 0:16:2,934
We've always tried
to keep crop rotations.


333
0:16:2,934 --> 0:16:6,634
Winter cereals are good because
they will generally grow


334
0:16:6,634 --> 0:16:11,334
on saline ground better than
row crop like corn or soybeans.


335
0:16:11,334 --> 0:16:13,968
But you have to grow
what makes money,


336
0:16:13,968 --> 0:16:16,267
and not that winter wheat
isn't good,


337
0:16:16,267 --> 0:16:20,267
but you can't raise winter wheat
every year or you can't raise


338
0:16:20,267 --> 0:16:23,634
sunflowers every year so you
have to raise a rotation,


339
0:16:23,634 --> 0:16:26,901
and some
of those rotations aren't
always very salt tolerant.


340
0:16:26,901 --> 0:16:30,2



341
0:16:30,2 --> 0:16:33,701
(Rick Burgum)
Well, the best way to reduce
your salinity problem


342
0:16:33,701 --> 0:16:35,634
is to drain the surface water.


343
0:16:35,634 --> 0:16:37,3
Oftentimes you can't do that.


344
0:16:37,3 --> 0:16:40,534
The passive ways to do it are
to grow something,


345
0:16:40,534 --> 0:16:43,1
but you have this contradiction
'cause nothing grows.


346
0:16:43,1 --> 0:16:47,634
The best thing to do is
to grow your way out of it,


347
0:16:47,634 --> 0:16:50,4
and we gotta find crops
that will grow,


348
0:16:50,4 --> 0:16:54,267
and then we've got to be able
to practically grow them.


349
0:16:54,267 --> 0:16:57,4
What we've doing on this plot is
trying to show differences


350
0:16:57,4 --> 0:17:0,434
in management, things that
we can do to help assist


351
0:17:0,434 --> 0:17:3,334
salt mobility and try to get
crop production and growth.


352
0:17:3,334 --> 0:17:6,567
With this research here, we're
trying to show that tillage is


353
0:17:6,567 --> 0:17:9,634
not an effective management tool
for saline areas and salt areas,


354
0:17:9,634 --> 0:17:12,33
specifically when they have
a lot of sodium


355
0:17:12,33 --> 0:17:14,567
but also when they have
a lot of calcium.


356
0:17:14,567 --> 0:17:18,467
In these plots, we did some
tillage, we did some no till,


357
0:17:18,467 --> 0:17:21,968
we also did
some no till with straw cover
to reduce evaporation.


358
0:17:21,968 --> 0:17:23,767
I really have 3 basic
treatments.


359
0:17:23,767 --> 0:17:25,434
I have high evaporation,


360
0:17:25,434 --> 0:17:28,133
what we would call a normal
evaporation here


361
0:17:28,133 --> 0:17:31,2
with our no till, and then also
reduced evaporation.


362
0:17:31,2 --> 0:17:34,701
And what the evaporation does is
bring the salts to the surface.


363
0:17:34,701 --> 0:17:37,534
So we're actually increasing
the salts in the concentration


364
0:17:37,534 --> 0:17:40,4
at the surface with the tillage
and the no till.


365
0:17:40,4 --> 0:17:43,2
The only treatments that are
helping us to reduce it


366
0:17:43,2 --> 0:17:45,2
a little bit is with the straw.


367
0:17:45,2 --> 0:17:48,567
I think the drainage
is a big thing


368
0:17:48,567 --> 0:17:51,267
to get rid
of the excess water first,


369
0:17:51,267 --> 0:17:53,534
and that'll help probably
pull away from--


370
0:17:53,534 --> 0:17:56,1
it'll start to shrink
some of these ponds,


371
0:17:56,1 --> 0:17:59,667
and that way the salts will
start disappearing on their own.


372
0:17:59,667 --> 0:18:2,234
We've been in kind of
a wet cycle


373
0:18:2,234 --> 0:18:4,601
so that's probably
part of the problem too.


374
0:18:4,601 --> 0:18:8,1
From here to there the salinity
was twice as much on this plot


375
0:18:8,1 --> 0:18:11,667
as it was there, so within ten
feet we had double the salinity.


376
0:18:11,667 --> 0:18:14,467
Even though there's not
a lot of topography change,


377
0:18:14,467 --> 0:18:17,467
there's no soil type change,
it's a water mobility thing.


378
0:18:17,467 --> 0:18:19,968



379
0:18:19,968 --> 0:18:22,334
We have downward movement
of water right here.


380
0:18:22,334 --> 0:18:24,33
With the resource concerns


381
0:18:24,33 --> 0:18:25,834
that we coming into our office,


382
0:18:25,834 --> 0:18:28,868
we just really felt we needed
to have some training


383
0:18:28,868 --> 0:18:31,3
for our employees
on how to handle salinity


384
0:18:31,3 --> 0:18:33,734
and how to work
with producers on salinity.


385
0:18:33,734 --> 0:18:37,601
You know, the work that we're
doing right now in North Dakota


386
0:18:37,601 --> 0:18:39,901
on working
with producers as NRCS


387
0:18:39,901 --> 0:18:43,2
we are looking at trying to get
into the rotation


388
0:18:43,2 --> 0:18:46,4
more salt tolerant vegetation
or trying to get cover crops


389
0:18:46,4 --> 0:18:48,634
that are more salt tolerant
of salinity--


390
0:18:48,634 --> 0:18:51,133
to try to treat
the saline areas,


391
0:18:51,133 --> 0:18:54,2
but we're also looking
at total landscape water use.


392
0:18:54,2 --> 0:19:0,901



393
0:19:0,901 --> 0:19:3,734
(narrator)
While growing salt tolerant
crops like alfalfa


394
0:19:3,734 --> 0:19:7,834
and barley or putting land
into CRP are long standing ways


395
0:19:7,834 --> 0:19:11,901
of dealing with and fighting
salinity, a third solution is


396
0:19:11,901 --> 0:19:14,67
more expensive and potentially
more controversial.


397
0:19:14,67 --> 0:19:16,667
It's the installation of
subsurface drainage pipes


398
0:19:16,667 --> 0:19:20,534
that are perforated so they're
put at a depth


399
0:19:20,534 --> 0:19:23,901
to reduce the drought water
levels below a level


400
0:19:23,901 --> 0:19:27,267
that'll allow the water to rise
to the surface.


401
0:19:27,267 --> 0:19:29,868
And what it does is,
it drains excess water


402
0:19:29,868 --> 0:19:31,901
that is not needed
for crop production.


403
0:19:31,901 --> 0:19:35,1
It doesn't affect the crop,
the water that the crop needs,


404
0:19:35,1 --> 0:19:37,467
but it drains excess water,
and it allows


405
0:19:37,467 --> 0:19:40,601
better aeration of soil which is
also important for crop growth.


406
0:19:40,601 --> 0:19:42,801
And with that,
the salts move with the water.


407
0:19:42,801 --> 0:19:46,1
So wherever the water goes is
where the salts are going to go.


408
0:19:46,1 --> 0:19:47,767
Other than that,
there are other things


409
0:19:47,767 --> 0:19:49,434
with sodium levels in the soil.


410
0:19:49,434 --> 0:19:51,1
If you have high sodium levels,


411
0:19:51,1 --> 0:19:53,4
the potential to leech out
the calcium salts


412
0:19:53,4 --> 0:19:55,367
will change the physical
properties of the soil,


413
0:19:55,367 --> 0:19:57,0
and it can actually accentuate


414
0:19:57,0 --> 0:19:59,367
or make the soils less fit
for crop production.


415
0:19:59,367 --> 0:20:1,968
There is some danger
with understanding essence


416
0:20:1,968 --> 0:20:6,334
of tile drainage, knowing your
soils is very, very important


417
0:20:6,334 --> 0:20:8,667
before you install
tile drainage,


418
0:20:8,667 --> 0:20:11,334
and having an understanding
of the history


419
0:20:11,334 --> 0:20:14,67
and the potential
for sodium-affected soils


420
0:20:14,67 --> 0:20:17,2
after you start to drain
that water out.


421
0:20:17,2 --> 0:20:19,534
Tile drainage works.
The advantage of tile drainage


422
0:20:19,534 --> 0:20:21,968
is that it allows the farmer
to regulate


423
0:20:21,968 --> 0:20:26,2
when it gets in the field and
when it gets out of the field.


424
0:20:26,2 --> 0:20:28,567
If there's a large rain,
the land manager can


425
0:20:28,567 --> 0:20:31,434
pretty much guarantee that
within 3 to 5 days, you're


426
0:20:31,434 --> 0:20:34,667
going to be able to get into
that field with tile drainage.


427
0:20:34,667 --> 0:20:37,467
Without tile drainage it might
be 7 to 12 days.


428
0:20:37,467 --> 0:20:40,434
(narrator) Roxanne Johnson
with North Dakota State
University Extension


429
0:20:40,434 --> 0:20:43,467
is in the midst
of a 5-year study on salinity,


430
0:20:43,467 --> 0:20:45,434
including the impact
of tile drainage.


431
0:20:45,434 --> 0:20:49,133
Where you put that outlet
is really, really important.


432
0:20:49,133 --> 0:20:52,1
Don't put it
upstream of someone's home


433
0:20:52,1 --> 0:20:54,934
so it's running by their house
so they have


434
0:20:54,934 --> 0:20:57,167
excess water sitting
in from of their homes.


435
0:20:57,167 --> 0:20:59,801
[chuckles] I'm a farm girl,
so I'm afraid


436
0:20:59,801 --> 0:21:3,1
that if we don't have tile
drainage that there won't be


437
0:21:3,1 --> 0:21:5,767
farming as we know it
in eastern North Dakota


438
0:21:5,767 --> 0:21:8,4
because of the high saline
levels in these fields.


439
0:21:8,4 --> 0:21:10,734
You talk to these producers,


440
0:21:10,734 --> 0:21:15,267
and it's the best thing
since white bread, apple pie!


441
0:21:15,267 --> 0:21:17,767
(narrator)
But other research
from Joleen Hadrich


442
0:21:17,767 --> 0:21:20,3
looked into the economics
of tiling


443
0:21:20,3 --> 0:21:23,834
which can cost farmers nearly
$600 per acre to install.


444
0:21:23,834 --> 0:21:28,467
I did my analysis assuming
$4.75 per bushel of corn,


445
0:21:28,467 --> 0:21:30,567
and now it's trading


446
0:21:30,567 --> 0:21:33,901
at $7.00 a bushel
on the futures market.


447
0:21:33,901 --> 0:21:36,868
Drainage tile would make
a lot more sense now,


448
0:21:36,868 --> 0:21:41,0
but at $4.00 corn and a yield
of 120 bushels per acre,


449
0:21:41,0 --> 0:21:45,0
the farmer would be losing
between $2.00 to $20.00 an acre


450
0:21:45,0 --> 0:21:47,33
if they put in drainage tile.


451
0:21:47,33 --> 0:21:49,834
It is expensive,
but it took land


452
0:21:49,834 --> 0:21:51,467
that was virtually worthless


453
0:21:51,467 --> 0:21:53,267
for annual crop production


454
0:21:53,267 --> 0:21:56,467
and made it good to excellent
crop production land.


455
0:21:56,467 --> 0:21:59,367
Tile drainage,
what we are doing here


456
0:21:59,367 --> 0:22:1,634
in the Red River Basin is


457
0:22:1,634 --> 0:22:4,968
installing drain tile to remove
excess subsurface water.


458
0:22:4,968 --> 0:22:8,3
There's really one reason
why farmers are


459
0:22:8,3 --> 0:22:10,834
installing drain tiles
on their fields,


460
0:22:10,834 --> 0:22:13,267
and it's for increasing
crop production.


461
0:22:13,267 --> 0:22:15,767
We've tiled fields
that farmers tell me


462
0:22:15,767 --> 0:22:18,868
are their saltiest fields,
and in a few years,


463
0:22:18,868 --> 0:22:20,667
probably 3 to 5 years,


464
0:22:20,667 --> 0:22:23,767
they are yielding as good
as their best fields.


465
0:22:23,767 --> 0:22:25,501
You look back here,


466
0:22:25,501 --> 0:22:27,601
and anytime you see
a pump pumping water,


467
0:22:27,601 --> 0:22:29,334
you know there's a perception


468
0:22:29,334 --> 0:22:31,4
that you're
making new water,


469
0:22:31,4 --> 0:22:33,67
and that is untrue.


470
0:22:33,67 --> 0:22:35,501
What we're doing is, we're


471
0:22:35,501 --> 0:22:37,2
lowering the water table,


472
0:22:37,2 --> 0:22:40,567
and we're creating
a reservoir in our field.


473
0:22:40,567 --> 0:22:42,167
We've done
a variety of things.


474
0:22:42,167 --> 0:22:45,701
We are drain tiling, trying
to get rid of some of the salts


475
0:22:45,701 --> 0:22:48,701
that naturally through the rain
will percolate through the soil


476
0:22:48,701 --> 0:22:50,801
and go out through
the drain tile.


477
0:22:50,801 --> 0:22:53,767
We've got an interesting project
with the University of Manitoba.


478
0:22:53,767 --> 0:22:57,33
There's a couple of Ph.D.
students doing their thesis


479
0:22:57,33 --> 0:22:59,601
on water movement
and saline soils,


480
0:22:59,601 --> 0:23:2,567
and we have got
a replicated trial here


481
0:23:2,567 --> 0:23:6,3
in the back of this farm
of about 15 acres.


482
0:23:6,3 --> 0:23:12,33
They will be trying to
determine how the saline areas


483
0:23:12,33 --> 0:23:15,934
are mitigated with
drainage and irrigation.


484
0:23:15,934 --> 0:23:20,0
(Dr. Cihacek) Once you take that
water and move it somewhere--


485
0:23:20,0 --> 0:23:24,33
you gotta move it somewhere--
put it into a drainage ditch.


486
0:23:24,33 --> 0:23:26,634
The problem
with our flat landscape is,


487
0:23:26,634 --> 0:23:29,601
it's hard to move it
any long distance.


488
0:23:29,601 --> 0:23:32,634
The water that comes out
of the drains contain salts.


489
0:23:32,634 --> 0:23:36,33
Now, my concern is with the
drainage that you can have


490
0:23:36,33 --> 0:23:39,434
a transfer of a problem from
one field to another field


491
0:23:39,434 --> 0:23:42,701
or another area because that
water is going to contain salts.


492
0:23:42,701 --> 0:23:47,667
If the water cannot flow off
freely, it ponds up.


493
0:23:47,667 --> 0:23:52,133
Then we've got the potential
of salinizing other land.


494
0:23:52,133 --> 0:23:55,701
Some of the preliminary numbers
that I've reviewed


495
0:23:55,701 --> 0:23:58,234
suggest that the total
dissolved solids


496
0:23:58,234 --> 0:24:2,467
in some of the tile drains are
very, very high.


497
0:24:2,467 --> 0:24:6,2
I've seen them 10,000, 15,000
milligrams per liter--


498
0:24:6,2 --> 0:24:8,934
some very high
sulphate numbers also.


499
0:24:8,934 --> 0:24:10,801
Now, one or two individually


500
0:24:10,801 --> 0:24:13,33
probably doesn't have
a great effect.


501
0:24:13,33 --> 0:24:15,3
What's unknown is
the cumulative effect


502
0:24:15,3 --> 0:24:17,868
of widespread tile drainage
on the tributaries


503
0:24:17,868 --> 0:24:21,634
flowing into the Red River
and the Red River itself.


504
0:24:21,634 --> 0:24:25,534
We do know that nitrate,
for instance, seems to be


505
0:24:25,534 --> 0:24:28,234
very, very high
in tile drainage waters.


506
0:24:28,234 --> 0:24:32,801



507
0:24:32,801 --> 0:24:34,934
Salinity is a global problem,


508
0:24:34,934 --> 0:24:39,467
but the solutions to that
should be and must be local.


509
0:24:39,467 --> 0:24:41,501
(narrator)
The causes of salinity are many,


510
0:24:41,501 --> 0:24:43,167
as are the potential solutions.


511
0:24:43,167 --> 0:24:45,801
The key for farmers
and soil experts is


512
0:24:45,801 --> 0:24:49,501
to curtail the problem before it
reaches levels that have caused


513
0:24:49,501 --> 0:24:51,834
economic collapse in other
countries, in other times.


514
0:24:51,834 --> 0:24:53,834
National, state
and local solutions


515
0:24:53,834 --> 0:24:56,33
will hopefully converge
to win the battle.


516
0:24:56,33 --> 0:24:59,0
Some of the crops as
North Dakota shifting into


517
0:24:59,0 --> 0:25:1,901
more of the corn belt
types of production


518
0:25:1,901 --> 0:25:3,567
with corn and soybeans.


519
0:25:3,567 --> 0:25:5,934
We're going to see
more problems emerge


520
0:25:5,934 --> 0:25:8,434
with saline soils
if we aren't careful.


521
0:25:8,434 --> 0:25:11,734
(Dr. Hopkins)
We have soils that are very,
very productive,


522
0:25:11,734 --> 0:25:15,67
but you can drive
any road in North Dakota


523
0:25:15,67 --> 0:25:17,267
and see examples
of egregious erosion.


524
0:25:17,267 --> 0:25:19,2
As government agencies, we need


525
0:25:19,2 --> 0:25:21,33
to work with the growers--


526
0:25:21,33 --> 0:25:24,534
corn growers, soybean growers
and really try to address


527
0:25:24,534 --> 0:25:26,601
this resource concern
in North Dakota.


528
0:25:26,601 --> 0:25:31,33
The universal advice which I
would like to repeat is


529
0:25:31,33 --> 0:25:34,901
instead of adapting the soil
to the plant,


530
0:25:34,901 --> 0:25:37,567
adapt the plant to the soil


531
0:25:37,567 --> 0:25:39,267
as a biological long-term,


532
0:25:39,267 --> 0:25:41,434
less expensive, and permanent
solution.


533
0:25:41,434 --> 0:25:51,1



534
0:25:51,1 --> 0:26:20,267



535
0:26:20,267 --> 0:26:22,3



536
0:26:22,3 --> 0:26:25,267
Funding for "Salt of the Earth"


537
0:26:25,267 --> 0:26:29,0
is made possible by an
EPA Section 319 grant


538
0:26:29,0 --> 0:26:32,133
administered by the North Dakota
Department of Health.
