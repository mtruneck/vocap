CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: What`s that time of
year to crown homecoming kings and we have


2
0:0:4,22 --> 0:0:8,49
one from Florida. You are not going to want
to miss. It`s coming up in just a few minutes,


3
0:0:8,49 --> 0:0:16,7
right here on CNN STUDENT NEWS.


4
0:0:16,7 --> 0:0:26,9
The first thing we are talking about today
is the civil war in Syria. Now, there are


5
0:0:26,9 --> 0:0:31,23
some signs that the conflict might be changing
a bit. The fighting in the Middle Eastern


6
0:0:31,23 --> 0:0:36,85
nation has been going on for 20 months now.
It started because some Syrians wanted changes


7
0:0:36,85 --> 0:0:41,35
to their government. Like for their president
to step down. Different rebel groups have


8
0:0:41,35 --> 0:0:46,19
been fighting against the government. This
weekend, they officially formed a single coalition,


9
0:0:46,19 --> 0:0:50,409
and some analysts think that a unified opposition
can have a better chance for victory. It`s


10
0:0:50,409 --> 0:0:55,339
been estimated that more than 35,000 people
have been killed since the Civil War started,


11
0:0:55,339 --> 0:1:0,309
more than 400,000 have left their homes because
of the fighting. And that includes two brothers


12
0:1:0,309 --> 0:1:5,939
that Arwa Damon met for her next report. Teachers,
this is a personal account about the war.


13
0:1:5,939 --> 0:1:10,79
We suggest that you preview it. The younger
brother who is 11 years old, was wounded in


14
0:1:10,79 --> 0:1:16,4
Iraq at attack. He lost one of his legs, that`s
when his older brother, who is 21, made a


15
0:1:16,4 --> 0:1:19,899
promise that led them out of their home country.
Here is their story.


16
0:1:19,899 --> 0:1:20,61
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


17
0:1:20,61 --> 0:1:25,729
ARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Like many other
boys his age, 11-year old Abdurrahman (ph)


18
0:1:25,729 --> 0:1:31,259
wanted to be a professional soccer player
when he grow up. But like so many others in


19
0:1:31,259 --> 0:1:35,39
his homeland of Syria, the violence shattered
his dream.


20
0:1:35,39 --> 0:1:42,17
OMAR, BROTHER: After he woke up as just, we
were just saying, I was crying. I cannot (ph)


21
0:1:42,17 --> 0:1:45,969
control myself. He said please don`t cry.
If you love me, don`t cry.


22
0:1:45,969 --> 0:1:51,429
DAMON: And that is when Omar made Abdurrahman
a promise, that he would walk again.


23
0:1:51,429 --> 0:2:0,359
OMAR: He started to hang onto that idea. So
I`m going out, and he kept saying to me, when


24
0:2:0,359 --> 0:2:5,509
are we - when are we leaving? Yeah, because
once - every time they are fighting, jets


25
0:2:5,509 --> 0:2:8,42
come, he says, when are we leaving? We should
leave.


26
0:2:8,42 --> 0:2:14,33
DAMON: Omar is now an expert at changing his
brother`s bandages. He started to save money


27
0:2:14,33 --> 0:2:20,43
for a prosthetic, but realized that it was
going to take too much time. He began asking


28
0:2:20,43 --> 0:2:26,59
around, and a group of visiting Egyptian doctors
told him about the Global Medical Relief Fund,


29
0:2:26,59 --> 0:2:34,459
a small U.S. NGO, dedicated to helping children
badly injured in disaster and war zones.


30
0:2:34,459 --> 0:2:40,709
Its founder Alyssa Montante (ph) was quick
to respond. But first, the brothers had to


31
0:2:40,709 --> 0:2:47,319
get to Turkey. A car drove them as close to
the border as it could, the driver`s last


32
0:2:47,319 --> 0:2:53,97
words "You are on your own now." Omar`s arms
were aching as he carried his brother and


33
0:2:53,97 --> 0:2:59,76
their three bags across the muddy field. The
brothers eventually made their way to Ankara


34
0:2:59,76 --> 0:3:6,25
in Turkey. But the boys don`t have passports.
Their visas to the U.S. were denied, and now


35
0:3:6,25 --> 0:3:11,17
they are waiting to see if the State Department
will grant them humanitarian parole.


36
0:3:11,17 --> 0:3:17,459
OMAR: The most important thing that he is
learning at this time, I think, it`s to be


37
0:3:17,459 --> 0:3:23,19
aware of everything, I mean to grow up his
mind, I mean. He`s not a child anymore.


38
0:3:23,19 --> 0:3:24,84
DAMON: Arwa Damon, CNN, Ankara.

40
0:3:25,84 --> 0:3:30,819
AZUZ: Next up, a natural disaster in Venice,
Italy. Severe flooding has led to the deaths


41
0:3:30,819 --> 0:3:35,659
of several people there, 200 Italians have
reportedly been forced out of their homes.


42
0:3:35,659 --> 0:3:39,45
Venice is in Northern Italy, it`s a major
seaport and a popular tourist destination.


43
0:3:39,45 --> 0:3:44,439
It`s famous for its canals. So you might usually
think of people riding down the street it


44
0:3:44,439 --> 0:3:50,329
boats, but this is anything but usual. Two
big weather systems combined together and


45
0:3:50,329 --> 0:3:56,189
drenched the city. Earlier this week, 70 percent
of Venice was under water. It was the city`s


46
0:3:56,189 --> 0:3:59,36
sixth highest water level in 140 years.

0:4:0,829 --> 0:4:6,799
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s first "Shoutout"
goes out to Mr. Toijala`s social studies classes


49
0:4:6,799 --> 0:4:11,379
at Lakeland Union High School in Minocqua,
Wisconsin.


50
0:4:11,379 --> 0:4:15,36
Which should be this part of the executive
branch of the U.S. government? You know what


51
0:4:15,36 --> 0:4:21,3
to do, is it the Library of Congress, U.S.
Copyright Office, Cabinet or U.S. Supreme


52
0:4:21,3 --> 0:4:27,97
Court? You`ve got three seconds, go!


53
0:4:27,97 --> 0:4:36,2
The executive branch includes the cabinet,
advisors to the president. That`s your answer


54
0:4:36,2 --> 0:4:38,13
and that`s your "Shoutout."


55
0:4:38,13 --> 0:4:39,84
(END VIDEO CLIP)


56
0:4:39,84 --> 0:4:46,139
AZUZ: But you are going to expect to see some
changes in President Obama`s cabinet in the


57
0:4:46,139 --> 0:4:50,9
days ahead. When a president is reelected.
Some of the advisors from the first term stay


58
0:4:50,9 --> 0:4:55,81
on, others don`t. It`s up to the president
to decide who stays and who goes. Now, the


59
0:4:55,81 --> 0:5:1,3
vice president is considered part of the cabinet,
but the other members are not elected. They


60
0:5:1,3 --> 0:5:5,94
are nominated by the president and confirmed
by the Senate, including the vice president,


61
0:5:5,94 --> 0:5:10,0
there are 16 members of the cabinet, you see
eight of those positions here, and here are


62
0:5:10,0 --> 0:5:14,34
the remaining eight positions. One interesting
thing about the cabinet: the word "cabinet"


63
0:5:14,34 --> 0:5:20,43
doesn`t actually appear in the U.S. Constitution.
But the concept does. Article II, Section


64
0:5:20,43 --> 0:5:25,5
2 says "[the president] may require the opinion
in writing, of the principal Officer in each


65
0:5:25,5 --> 0:5:30,18
of the executive departments, upon any Subject
relating to the Duties of their respective


66
0:5:30,18 --> 0:5:35,71
Offices ..." It doesn`t say what departments
or how many of them there should be. The first


67
0:5:35,71 --> 0:5:39,639
U.S. president had four cabinet members, more
were added over the years.


68
0:5:39,639 --> 0:5:41,13

69
0:5:41,13 --> 0:5:47,0
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Time for a "Shoutout
Extra Credit." Ohms, amperes, coulombs are


70
0:5:47,0 --> 0:5:54,35
associated with what? You know what to do?
Is it sound, electricity, pressure or temperature?


71
0:5:54,35 --> 0:5:57,25
Put another three seconds on the clock and
go.


72
0:5:57,25 --> 0:6:6,849
You might get a charge from knowing that these
options are all associated with electricity.


73
0:6:6,849 --> 0:6:11,229
That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout
Extra Credit."

75
0:6:13,2 --> 0:6:17,91
AZUZ: "Motor Trends" magazine names a car
of the year. And this year, for the first


76
0:6:17,91 --> 0:6:22,889
time, the winner is all electric. It`s the
Tesla model S, and according to representatives


77
0:6:22,889 --> 0:6:28,3
from the magazine, the voting wasn`t close.
The luxury car didn`t win just because it`s


78
0:6:28,3 --> 0:6:32,419
electric. "Motor Trends" said it won in part
because of its performance. Zero to 60 in


79
0:6:32,419 --> 0:6:36,81
four seconds, and because it`s one of the
most efficient cars ever tested, averaging


80
0:6:36,81 --> 0:6:42,37
nearly 75 miles per gallon or the electric
equivalent of that. Only a couple of hundred


81
0:6:42,37 --> 0:6:49,5
have been sold, they ain`t cheap, the Tesla
averages between $50,000 and $100,000.


82
0:6:49,5 --> 0:6:53,759
Our next story today comes from Port St. Lucy,
Florida. High school student there has cerebral


83
0:6:53,759 --> 0:6:58,84
palsy. It`s a medical disorder that effects
movement, posture or muscle tone. His fellow


84
0:6:58,84 --> 0:7:3,229
students nominated him to the homecoming court.
But if you are worried we just spoiled the


85
0:7:3,229 --> 0:7:9,3
ending of that story, no, we`ll let WPBF`s
Randy Gillenhal (ph) take it from here.


86

87
0:7:9,669 --> 0:7:14,31
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s homecoming football
at Centennial High School. And watching from


88
0:7:14,31 --> 0:7:20,36
the stands, sits senior Hakam Daley in his
wheelchair. Hakam has cerebral palsy. His


89
0:7:20,36 --> 0:7:25,6
caretaker Chris, a football coach, helps him
get in and out of the car and carries his


90
0:7:25,6 --> 0:7:26,389
book bag at school.


91
0:7:26,389 --> 0:7:28,46
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Going through a crowded
hallway can be tough.


92
0:7:28,46 --> 0:7:32,33
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live hasn`t always been
easy for Hakam. Put up for adoption, he`s


93
0:7:32,33 --> 0:7:37,4
been in and out of foster homes for most of
his life, but one thing he does have, is a


94
0:7:37,4 --> 0:7:41,94
big smile and lots of friends who nominated
him to be homecoming king.


95
0:7:41,94 --> 0:7:48,71
HAKAM DALEY, HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR: When I heard
the message, my -- I -- I had no words to


96
0:7:48,71 --> 0:7:51,509
describe. I was so happy.


97
0:7:51,509 --> 0:7:52,979
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Go, Eagles!


98
0:7:52,979 --> 0:7:57,5
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kayla Donohue was the cheerleader,
and one of Hakam`s good friends. She secretly


99
0:7:57,5 --> 0:8:1,879
rallied up the senior class and got them to
put his name on the homecoming court.


100
0:8:1,879 --> 0:8:4,87
KAYLA DONOHUE, STUDENT: It just showed how
well as the group we can come together and


101
0:8:4,87 --> 0:8:10,8
make such a special person have such a special
experience that he is going to remember for


102
0:8:10,8 --> 0:8:11,0
the rest of his life.


103
0:8:11,0 --> 0:8:14,849
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hakam lines up with the
other nominees: football stars and popular


104
0:8:14,849 --> 0:8:17,9
kids. He`ll have to roll his wheelchair out
onto the field.


105
0:8:17,9 --> 0:8:26,449
DALEY: I feel nervous, very nervous, it`s
going to be exciting. I know that God is with


106
0:8:26,449 --> 0:8:26,65
me.


107
0:8:26,65 --> 0:8:31,58
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But as they call his name,
he`s got a surprise for everybody in the crowd.


108
0:8:31,58 --> 0:8:39,19
Hakam takes his first steps walking publicly
for the very first time. And when they announced


109
0:8:39,19 --> 0:8:44,28
the winner, the homecoming king, the students
here have a surprise right back.


110
0:8:44,28 --> 0:8:47,88
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Homecoming king is Hakam.


111
0:8:47,88 --> 0:8:49,76
AUDIENCE: (cheering)


112
0:8:49,76 --> 0:8:56,5
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He`s a great guy, he deserves
this more than anybody else I know. So it


113
0:8:56,5 --> 0:8:57,58
just made me so proud.


114
0:8:57,58 --> 0:9:2,78
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Surrounded by cheerleaders
and flashing cameras, Hakam Daley is the most


115
0:9:2,78 --> 0:9:5,1
popular kid at his high school.

AZUZ: What a story! Today`s before we go,
segment is explosive. Now, like a lot of you


118
0:9:10,81 --> 0:9:15,88
, I like a good firework show. The government
of Kuwait really likes a good firework show.


119
0:9:15,88 --> 0:9:22,13
Hopefully, the country`s people do too, this
one went on for a while. 77,282 individual


120
0:9:22,13 --> 0:9:29,4
fireworks. Yes, that is a new record and one
that cost $15 million to set. The country


121
0:9:29,4 --> 0:9:33,92
was celebrating the 50th anniversary of its
constitution, obviously, that`s an event they


122
0:9:33,92 --> 0:9:37,43
don`t take lightly, that extinguishes all
the time we have for today. We will be back


123
0:9:37,43 --> 0:11:37,43
with more illuminating stories tomorrow. So
I hope to see you all then. Bye now.
