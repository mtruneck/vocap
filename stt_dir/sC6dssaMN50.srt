1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,12



2
0:0:1,12 --> 0:0:2,75
DYLAN RIEDER: I got the
new Alien Workshop


3
0:0:2,75 --> 0:0:4,8
Warhol series for us.


4
0:0:4,8 --> 0:0:4,78
Those are pretty cool.


5
0:0:4,78 --> 0:0:5,28
Have you seen those?


6
0:0:5,28 --> 0:0:5,575
MALE SPEAKER: No.


7
0:0:5,575 --> 0:0:6,82
DYLAN RIEDER: They're sick.


8
0:0:6,82 --> 0:0:7,67
The Berra one's pretty good.


9
0:0:7,67 --> 0:0:8,92
He looks like a weirdo.


10
0:0:8,92 --> 0:0:11,45



11
0:0:11,45 --> 0:0:13,562
There's that one.


12
0:0:13,562 --> 0:0:16,254
Fucking Dyrdek.


13
0:0:16,254 --> 0:0:19,34
You got Arto's.


14
0:0:19,34 --> 0:0:20,59
Grant's.


15
0:0:20,59 --> 0:0:23,7



16
0:0:23,7 --> 0:0:26,5
Mine's the bananas.


17
0:0:26,5 --> 0:0:29,13
And I feel like that'll
be the hot seller.


18
0:0:29,13 --> 0:0:30,38
Dill's.


19
0:0:30,38 --> 0:0:33,69



20
0:0:33,69 --> 0:0:35,914
MALE SPEAKER: Dang, there's
a lot of that Alien pros.


21
0:0:35,914 --> 0:0:36,81
DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah.


22
0:0:36,81 --> 0:0:43,7
I think Workshop 2, there's
not really a genre.


23
0:0:43,7 --> 0:0:43,98
Everybody's so different.


24
0:0:43,98 --> 0:0:51,34
You got Heath and then AVE
and then Dyrdek and a


25
0:0:51,34 --> 0:0:54,72
broad expand of dudes.


26
0:0:54,72 --> 0:0:55,89
MALE SPEAKER: Kalis.


27
0:0:55,89 --> 0:0:56,29
DYLAN RIEDER: Kalis.


28
0:0:56,29 --> 0:0:58,33
Well, now he's DGKalis.


29
0:0:58,33 --> 0:0:59,7
Kalis left.


30
0:0:59,7 --> 0:1:2,3
I'm sure he was feeling
a bit like an outcast.


31
0:1:2,3 --> 0:1:6,72
Going on tour, I think it would
just be AVE, Jake, Dill,


32
0:1:6,72 --> 0:1:10,12
Heath, and then Kalis.


33
0:1:10,12 --> 0:1:12,85
BILL STROBECK: I could see where
it seemed like if Kalis


34
0:1:12,85 --> 0:1:15,47
felt that way, which I feel like
he did, that he felt like


35
0:1:15,47 --> 0:1:16,27
he didn't fit in.


36
0:1:16,27 --> 0:1:20,33
Because Josh has been
on since forever.


37
0:1:20,33 --> 0:1:22,3
Someone like Josh is
more of a team guy.


38
0:1:22,3 --> 0:1:25,87
He likes to have the whole
team get together.


39
0:1:25,87 --> 0:1:27,57
He's real about that.


40
0:1:27,57 --> 0:1:30,23
I felt like he didn't feel like
he fit in when he was


41
0:1:30,23 --> 0:1:33,705
there before all those guys.


42
0:1:33,705 --> 0:1:38,36
They all took over, all those
new kids and AVE and Dylan--


43
0:1:38,36 --> 0:1:40,11
and those guys.


44
0:1:40,11 --> 0:1:43,66
It just seemed like it was
their team, kind of.


45
0:1:43,66 --> 0:1:46,98



46
0:1:46,98 --> 0:1:49,3
JASON DILL: Workshop got divided
into upriver and


47
0:1:49,3 --> 0:1:50,14
downriver at one point.


48
0:1:50,14 --> 0:1:54,4
And now that Kalis is gone,
there's less upriver.


49
0:1:54,4 --> 0:1:57,243
Dyrdek, Mikey Taylor,
Berra is so upriver.


50
0:1:57,243 --> 0:1:58,19
MALE SPEAKER: What
does that mean?


51
0:1:58,19 --> 0:2:0,77
JASON DILL: They're upriver.


52
0:2:0,77 --> 0:2:6,34
They're where TVs exist, the
internet, fishing's better.


53
0:2:6,34 --> 0:2:8,0
Who's in the van on tour?


54
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:11,64
Who's dirty and in the
streets all the time?


55
0:2:11,64 --> 0:2:13,8
The downriver kids.


56
0:2:13,8 --> 0:2:16,29
So Dylan was instantly
downriver with us.


57
0:2:16,29 --> 0:2:18,81
As far as Dylan goes, between
the time he got on the


58
0:2:18,81 --> 0:2:24,14
Workshop and him just being with
us all the time and being


59
0:2:24,14 --> 0:2:26,64
so much like AVE and I,
it seemed like he


60
0:2:26,64 --> 0:2:28,126
wasn't ever not there.


61
0:2:28,126 --> 0:2:31,43



62
0:2:31,43 --> 0:2:34,65
ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: He just
embodies a classic, good


63
0:2:34,65 --> 0:2:39,93
style, gnarly, talented skater,
and into just who he


64
0:2:39,93 --> 0:2:40,64
is and stuff.


65
0:2:40,64 --> 0:2:43,28
It just fit into the Workshop.


66
0:2:43,28 --> 0:2:43,64
Whatever.


67
0:2:43,64 --> 0:2:46,34
He's his own person.


68
0:2:46,34 --> 0:2:47,82
JASON DILL: Dylan's
like me and AVE--


69
0:2:47,82 --> 0:2:49,55
hand tattoos, smoking
cigarettes.


70
0:2:49,55 --> 0:2:51,622
There's so many times me and AVE
looked at him and we were


71
0:2:51,622 --> 0:2:53,96
like, wow, look at him.


72
0:2:53,96 --> 0:2:54,2
He's growing up so fast.


73
0:2:54,2 --> 0:2:55,868
Oh, boy.


74
0:2:55,868 --> 0:2:58,223
And then shit gets
new with him.


75
0:2:58,223 --> 0:3:0,36
DYLAN RIEDER: These guys
are pretty tight.


76
0:3:0,36 --> 0:3:2,52
Burgundy loafers.


77
0:3:2,52 --> 0:3:5,27
They're slip-ons,
kind of cool.


78
0:3:5,27 --> 0:3:7,76
MALE SPEAKER: These shoes
are pretty infamous.


79
0:3:7,76 --> 0:3:8,0
DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah.


80
0:3:8,0 --> 0:3:11,306
I think they got a lot of
talk when they came out.


81
0:3:11,306 --> 0:3:13,9
I definitely got some
shit for them.


82
0:3:13,9 --> 0:3:15,26
But I fucking dig them.


83
0:3:15,26 --> 0:3:15,62
They're awesome.


84
0:3:15,62 --> 0:3:18,18
When you skate them,
this red comes off.


85
0:3:18,18 --> 0:3:25,21
It's super thin leather, so
it bleeds kind of crazy.


86
0:3:25,21 --> 0:3:26,71
MARK OBLOW: Well, Dylan
was on Vans.


87
0:3:26,71 --> 0:3:30,13
And at the time, he was
wearing the slip-ons.


88
0:3:30,13 --> 0:3:32,6
That's all he wore,
slip-on, slip-on.


89
0:3:32,6 --> 0:3:36,2
So when we started Gravis, that
was the thing was for him


90
0:3:36,2 --> 0:3:38,97
and Arto, it's like this was
going to be their deal.


91
0:3:38,97 --> 0:3:40,9
And they could do whatever
they wanted.


92
0:3:40,9 --> 0:3:43,4
It was just really like,
what do you want?


93
0:3:43,4 --> 0:3:44,82
And that's what he wanted.


94
0:3:44,82 --> 0:3:48,86
Because he wanted something that
when he's skating, looks


95
0:3:48,86 --> 0:3:51,71
like when he's walking
around at night.


96
0:3:51,71 --> 0:3:54,98
So at the time, Dylan was super
influenced by fashion


97
0:3:54,98 --> 0:3:57,88
and just stuff in that world.


98
0:3:57,88 --> 0:4:2,9
And that's where it stemmed from
was not going, oh, how


99
0:4:2,9 --> 0:4:7,75
can we rip off the
Nike Dunk again?


100
0:4:7,75 --> 0:4:8,99
You look at a lot of shoes.


101
0:4:8,99 --> 0:4:12,35
And it's sad to say, but they
rip off the classics.


102
0:4:12,35 --> 0:4:14,21
He wanted to do something
different as well.


103
0:4:14,21 --> 0:4:17,68
He was willing to take the
risk and said, fuck it.


104
0:4:17,68 --> 0:4:18,339
I don't care.


105
0:4:18,339 --> 0:4:19,76
Because he did get a
lot of heat for it.


106
0:4:19,76 --> 0:4:23,11
And that's a part of Dylan, too,
where he is a tough kid,


107
0:4:23,11 --> 0:4:24,27
where you can go, fuck you.


108
0:4:24,27 --> 0:4:25,8
I don't care.


109
0:4:25,8 --> 0:4:26,97
And yeah, that's my shoe.


110
0:4:26,97 --> 0:4:27,48
Ha.


111
0:4:27,48 --> 0:4:29,6
JASON DILL: Everybody secretly
wants those shoes.


112
0:4:29,6 --> 0:4:32,94
Did you hear the story
about the enjoy team?


113
0:4:32,94 --> 0:4:35,43
So the enjoy team was on
a tour with Joe Brook.


114
0:4:35,43 --> 0:4:36,1
He just told me this.


115
0:4:36,1 --> 0:4:38,92
And they kept talking
about Dylan's shoe.


116
0:4:38,92 --> 0:4:40,45
And at first, it was like,
[DISCONTENTED MUTTERING]


117
0:4:40,45 --> 0:4:41,75
who is this?


118
0:4:41,75 --> 0:4:44,22
Maybe not so bad, but probably
something like that.


119
0:4:44,22 --> 0:4:46,31
And they were like, man,
someone must have said,


120
0:4:46,31 --> 0:4:47,46
actually, I saw them.


121
0:4:47,46 --> 0:4:48,85
And they're fucking
so comfortable and


122
0:4:48,85 --> 0:4:49,58
they're super sick.


123
0:4:49,58 --> 0:4:53,43
And I just thought, see,
that's what it's about.


124
0:4:53,43 --> 0:4:56,43
It's about, fuck you guys.


125
0:4:56,43 --> 0:4:59,28
Fuck me what I think.


126
0:4:59,28 --> 0:5:1,42
Look at this original little
fucker running around with his


127
0:5:1,42 --> 0:5:3,52
cute little rolled-up pants and
his fucking shirts with


128
0:5:3,52 --> 0:5:5,27
the buttons on and a little
necklace and shit.


129
0:5:5,27 --> 0:5:6,58
He looks great.


130
0:5:6,58 --> 0:5:7,225
That's what's funny.


131
0:5:7,225 --> 0:5:9,61
You talk about the way
that Dylan dresses.


132
0:5:9,61 --> 0:5:12,25
Look what we're doing now,
talking about Dylan.


133
0:5:12,25 --> 0:5:14,32
So joke's on you.


134
0:5:14,32 --> 0:5:15,54
You're not as good-looking
as him.


135
0:5:15,54 --> 0:5:16,8
GREG HUNT: You should
be able to dress


136
0:5:16,8 --> 0:5:18,0
however you want to dress.


137
0:5:18,0 --> 0:5:21,0
Look at how Hosoi dressed
in the '80s.


138
0:5:21,0 --> 0:5:23,54
He was full rock star.


139
0:5:23,54 --> 0:5:26,58
It's all about doing
your own thing.


140
0:5:26,58 --> 0:5:29,95
But what it really comes down
to is your skating.


141
0:5:29,95 --> 0:5:33,3
| think he's a full skate rat.


142
0:5:33,3 --> 0:5:34,9
Yeah, he might wear sometimes
nice clothes.


143
0:5:34,9 --> 0:5:35,94
He might skate in
nice clothes.


144
0:5:35,94 --> 0:5:40,15
But dude, it's not keeping him
from trying something insane


145
0:5:40,15 --> 0:5:43,35
and slamming for five hours
till he gets something.


146
0:5:43,35 --> 0:5:45,12
So there's definitely
a little bit of


147
0:5:45,12 --> 0:5:46,93
negativity towards Dylan.


148
0:5:46,93 --> 0:5:49,384
But that's all people
who don't know him.


149
0:5:49,384 --> 0:5:52,11



150
0:5:52,11 --> 0:5:53,975
JASON DILL: I think that the
thing is, I think that the way


151
0:5:53,975 --> 0:5:58,46
that Dylan dresses in "Mind
Field" sticks out so much.


152
0:5:58,46 --> 0:6:2,73
Because when it starts, you
have Dylan, Vans shoe.


153
0:6:2,73 --> 0:6:7,73
And someone would say a normal
type of that kid.


154
0:6:7,73 --> 0:6:11,62
Then as the video part
progresses, all of a sudden,


155
0:6:11,62 --> 0:6:17,22
Dylan's got some fucking jeans,
his little dance shoes


156
0:6:17,22 --> 0:6:18,98
on, and a tank top.


157
0:6:18,98 --> 0:6:21,59
And it's fucking great.


158
0:6:21,59 --> 0:6:24,9
It's like, yeah, of course.


159
0:6:24,9 --> 0:6:27,19
And now when you see
Dylan, the look


160
0:6:27,19 --> 0:6:28,45
is perfectly together.


161
0:6:28,45 --> 0:6:32,77
I back a look big time,
give a fuck.


162
0:6:32,77 --> 0:6:34,3
I'm always coming
up with looks.


163
0:6:34,3 --> 0:6:34,63
I love it.


164
0:6:34,63 --> 0:6:36,2
But now I'm stuck in a look.


165
0:6:36,2 --> 0:6:38,78
I can't get out of the
pulled-up socks.


166
0:6:38,78 --> 0:6:41,16
BILL STROBECK: The way Dylan
dresses reminds me of


167
0:6:41,16 --> 0:6:42,6
Dill at that time.


168
0:6:42,6 --> 0:6:44,55
When I first met Dill, it was
like, here are my fancy,


169
0:6:44,55 --> 0:6:45,65
fashionable shoes.


170
0:6:45,65 --> 0:6:49,7
And here is these pants
that no one's wearing.


171
0:6:49,7 --> 0:6:53,4
Dill had those cut-off pants
that were big and short.


172
0:6:53,4 --> 0:6:54,53
They were like high waters.


173
0:6:54,53 --> 0:6:57,17
But it had something
to do with fashion.


174
0:6:57,17 --> 0:6:59,305
And I think that Dylan's
into that.


175
0:6:59,305 --> 0:7:0,195
MALE SPEAKER: Do you
think that Dylan


176
0:7:0,195 --> 0:7:1,69
takes that from Dill?


177
0:7:1,69 --> 0:7:3,1
BILL STROBECK: I don't think
he takes it from Dill.


178
0:7:3,1 --> 0:7:6,17
I think that he just expresses
himself in the same way that


179
0:7:6,17 --> 0:7:10,4
Dill did when he felt like he
could be his own person.


180
0:7:10,4 --> 0:7:10,58
He's young.


181
0:7:10,58 --> 0:7:14,89
When I was that age, I had
Richard Avedon CK One photos


182
0:7:14,89 --> 0:7:15,52
on my wall.


183
0:7:15,52 --> 0:7:19,44
And this is his age to do
that kind of stuff.


184
0:7:19,44 --> 0:7:21,75
He likes model chicks.


185
0:7:21,75 --> 0:7:22,39
He'll grow out of that.


186
0:7:22,39 --> 0:7:25,42
I'd say if you could look up
the words "cool breeze"


187
0:7:25,42 --> 0:7:28,39
online, that's the perfect
explanation for Dylan.


188
0:7:28,39 --> 0:7:31,52
He's a cool breeze, sunglasses,
and fucking


189
0:7:31,52 --> 0:7:34,15
sitting in the corner and not
really talking to that many


190
0:7:34,15 --> 0:7:36,58
people, especially
around that time.


191
0:7:36,58 --> 0:7:39,2
He was just a fucking
young, mellow dude.


192
0:7:39,2 --> 0:7:40,44
MARK OBLOW: And that's
how he's always been.


193
0:7:40,44 --> 0:7:44,11
And that's part of the mystique
of Dylan, and even


194
0:7:44,11 --> 0:7:47,21
covering up in the hoodies, and
all the shit is he doesn't


195
0:7:47,21 --> 0:7:49,49
like that attention.


196
0:7:49,49 --> 0:7:52,23
He doesn't like the whole pretty
boy and all this stuff.


197
0:7:52,23 --> 0:7:54,62
And it's like, Dylan is
a good-looking kid.


198
0:7:54,62 --> 0:7:59,16
And then because of that, he
gets points taken away, you


199
0:7:59,16 --> 0:7:59,58
know what I mean?


200
0:7:59,58 --> 0:8:4,72
Where if he was fucking
ugly, he would


201
0:8:4,72 --> 0:8:5,73
be looked at different.


202
0:8:5,73 --> 0:8:7,915
But he had to prove himself.


203
0:8:7,915 --> 0:8:10,7
JASON DILL: You can give Dylan
all the shit you want.


204
0:8:10,7 --> 0:8:14,51
But he looks great.


205
0:8:14,51 --> 0:8:16,956
He's goddamn good-looking.


206
0:8:16,956 --> 0:8:18,93
MARK OBLOW: That's obviously,
too, the big difference


207
0:8:18,93 --> 0:8:20,35
fucking the chicks.


208
0:8:20,35 --> 0:8:24,27
It's like, at his video
premiere, we had that party.


209
0:8:24,27 --> 0:8:26,875
And it's like, you look at all
the people in the crowd and


210
0:8:26,875 --> 0:8:28,2
all the guys.


211
0:8:28,2 --> 0:8:31,71
And then there's just rows of
all these good-looking girls.


212
0:8:31,71 --> 0:8:33,32
And they're all just staring,
watching the


213
0:8:33,32 --> 0:8:34,289
whole entire parks.


214
0:8:34,289 --> 0:8:36,38
And they're like, oh, he's
so good, his style.


215
0:8:36,38 --> 0:8:37,34
He's so smooth.


216
0:8:37,34 --> 0:8:40,86
You're just like, fucking
asshole, man.


217
0:8:40,86 --> 0:8:41,94
What a dick.


218
0:8:41,94 --> 0:8:43,52
BILL STROBECK: Dylan
can get ass, man.


219
0:8:43,52 --> 0:8:44,12
He's confident.


220
0:8:44,12 --> 0:8:45,74
He's real confident.


221
0:8:45,74 --> 0:8:48,97
He'll fuck them and
chuck them, dude.


222
0:8:48,97 --> 0:8:50,13
He gets some.


223
0:8:50,13 --> 0:8:52,13
Him and Alex both have--


224
0:8:52,13 --> 0:8:56,63
they're both good-looking,
like fucking Johnny Depp.


225
0:8:56,63 --> 0:9:1,99
This one night, I went to this
place, this club out in LA,


226
0:9:1,99 --> 0:9:5,6
and went and met Dylan.


227
0:9:5,6 --> 0:9:7,15
And then I look over
and I'm like--


228
0:9:7,15 --> 0:9:8,36
Alex is getting in.


229
0:9:8,36 --> 0:9:9,32
He's like, hey, what's up?


230
0:9:9,32 --> 0:9:10,3
What's up?


231
0:9:10,3 --> 0:9:10,9
I was like, hey man.


232
0:9:10,9 --> 0:9:11,68
What are you doing?


233
0:9:11,68 --> 0:9:15,47
But they didn't really
say hi to each other.


234
0:9:15,47 --> 0:9:16,98
I go, what's going
on with that?


235
0:9:16,98 --> 0:9:21,59
And they have a nightlife
beef or something.


236
0:9:21,59 --> 0:9:24,46
We'll see who gets the
girls tonight.


237
0:9:24,46 --> 0:9:27,4
Usually, it's Dylan.


238
0:9:27,4 --> 0:9:29,37
But it's real funny.


239
0:9:29,37 --> 0:9:31,85
I think that girls probably
think little


240
0:9:31,85 --> 0:9:34,19
Alex is better looking.


241
0:9:34,19 --> 0:9:36,47
Dylan's more like a woman.


242
0:9:36,47 --> 0:9:39,93
Not like a woman, but
he's very pretty.


243
0:9:39,93 --> 0:9:42,87
And I guess little
Alex is more--


244
0:9:42,87 --> 0:9:44,7
I don't know.


245
0:9:44,7 --> 0:9:46,19
He's like his dad.


246
0:9:46,19 --> 0:9:48,4
Except for his dad gets
more ass than him.


247
0:9:48,4 --> 0:9:54,8
But little Alex, though, doesn't
really say that much


248
0:9:54,8 --> 0:9:55,41
because he's kind of shy.


249
0:9:55,41 --> 0:9:58,4
And I think that girls are
intimidated by him.


250
0:9:58,4 --> 0:9:59,64
So they won't go up to him.


251
0:9:59,64 --> 0:10:2,22
And meanwhile, he won't
go up to them.


252
0:10:2,22 --> 0:10:5,33



253
0:10:5,33 --> 0:10:7,51
Oddly enough, he ends up going
home probably alone.


254
0:10:7,51 --> 0:12:7,51
