davis wrote a recently wrote this great
piece about the public education system


2
0:0:3,889 --> 0:0:8,429
and how some politicians and some
corporations are really fighting hard to


3
0:0:8,429 --> 0:0:11,84
make sure that they can switch public
schools to try our schools


4
0:0:11,84 --> 0:0:15,53
now charter schools are not private
schools are still publicly-funded


5
0:0:15,53 --> 0:0:19,71
however they do not have uh... union
representation and uh... you know they


6
0:0:19,71 --> 0:0:23,669
don't abide by the same rules that
certain public schools too


7
0:0:23,669 --> 0:0:28,489
their companies like amazon and
microsoft that are really finding this


8
0:0:28,489 --> 0:0:32,769
push for charter schools and a lot of
times when the media talks about this


9
0:0:32,769 --> 0:0:37,19
they make it seem as though uh... you
know these corporations are doing it


10
0:0:37,19 --> 0:0:40,26
because they're really want to case
reforming really care about the children


11
0:0:40,26 --> 0:0:45,449
well-coached but is david sort of points
out perfectly of course it's all about


12
0:0:45,449 --> 0:0:50,78
the money now cos like uh... amazon and
microsoft have tablets that they want to


13
0:0:50,78 --> 0:0:56,1
sell to these school districts to these
charter schools of core


14
0:0:56,1 --> 0:0:57,6
of course


15
0:0:57,6 --> 0:1:1,66
all turns out they have a profit motive
why didn't see that coming huge profit


16
0:1:1,66 --> 0:1:2,6
motive so


17
0:1:2,6 --> 0:1:6,21
some might argue well cap public schools
signed contracts with these corporations


18
0:1:6,21 --> 0:1:9,92
and you know do the same thing knelt
there are certain rules that prevent


19
0:1:9,92 --> 0:1:13,53
public schools from signing contracts
with microsoft or amazon


20
0:1:13,53 --> 0:1:16,249
but with charter schools as i've
mentioned they don't necessarily have to


21
0:1:16,249 --> 0:1:20,89
abide by the same rules so these cup
corporations are hoping that they can


22
0:1:20,89 --> 0:1:25,149
cash out big time by getting these
charter school society's contracts and


23
0:1:25,149 --> 0:1:29,2
by the way some might argue well
technology is good it's gonna improve


24
0:1:29,2 --> 0:1:33,229
the education of these young people but
not so fast studies indicate that a lot


25
0:1:33,229 --> 0:1:37,27
of these charter schools on average do
not perform better than our public


26
0:1:37,27 --> 0:1:40,469
schools to so that i was really
surprised but it's not always assume


27
0:1:40,469 --> 0:1:43,4
that the charter schools we're gonna do
that honestly


28
0:1:43,4 --> 0:1:47,88
uh... and parties is that we've been
competition and i believe that he in


29
0:1:47,88 --> 0:1:49,79
diversity so


30
0:1:49,79 --> 0:1:51,93
if you ever want to give a speech trying
different ways


31
0:1:51,93 --> 0:1:52,97
i thought that


32
0:1:52,97 --> 0:1:56,61
the cream would rise to the top and you
see what works and what does it and that


33
0:1:56,61 --> 0:2:0,5
on average the charter schools would be
available schools dot was proven wrong


34
0:2:0,5 --> 0:2:1,479
that's not what happened


35
0:2:1,479 --> 0:2:3,359
but this story begins to explain


36
0:2:3,359 --> 0:2:4,99
part of the reason why


37
0:2:4,99 --> 0:2:8,31
because this is the reason why there is
some of the rooms not all the rules the


38
0:2:8,31 --> 0:2:11,79
some of the rules of the public schools
now we take away those


39
0:2:11,79 --> 0:2:14,269
rose what winds up having trouble
schools


40
0:2:14,269 --> 0:2:18,2
well these for bridges come in they go
by this by that by this by that


41
0:2:18,2 --> 0:2:21,52
forget the rules committee begin date
but it turns out the charter schools


42
0:2:21,52 --> 0:2:23,78
wind up being totally inefficient


43
0:2:23,78 --> 0:2:28,78
yes in fact the administrative costs
uh... are extremely high a relatively


44
0:2:28,78 --> 0:2:30,91
speaking in charter schools


45
0:2:30,91 --> 0:2:34,47
uh... so that's really a big problem in
david sort of points to that perfectly


46
0:2:34,47 --> 0:2:38,68
but uh... of course i would berber doc
is also getting in on the action which i


47
0:2:38,68 --> 0:2:42,37
thought was really interesting so let me
read you are a small part of davis read


48
0:2:42,37 --> 0:2:42,929
this piece


49
0:2:42,929 --> 0:2:47,119
he says the los angeles times reported
that music american eight donated a


50
0:2:47,119 --> 0:2:49,52
quarter million dollars to the reform
slate


51
0:2:49,52 --> 0:2:53,65
that's the same news america that is the
for-profit education technology arm of


52
0:2:53,65 --> 0:2:58,25
rupert murdoch's newscorp it's the same
news america that was recently died


53
0:2:58,25 --> 0:3:2,569
trumpeted by the new york times for
rolling out it's an expensive tablet


54
0:3:2,569 --> 0:3:6,79
that will be targeted at middle school
children that is if the company can


55
0:3:6,79 --> 0:3:8,129
convinced the school board candidates


56
0:3:8,129 --> 0:3:12,219
that'd under rights to divert money away
from firing teachers and into the news


57
0:3:12,219 --> 0:3:14,529
america's coffers


58
0:3:14,529 --> 0:3:17,469
if you are well public corporations


59
0:3:17,469 --> 0:3:20,989
unlimited rain in all of our affairs


60
0:3:20,989 --> 0:3:22,979
will they do removed


61
0:3:22,979 --> 0:3:25,109
who's the rules to their kind of like
this


62
0:3:25,109 --> 0:3:31,619
they have to they their charter is make
every single red set you can


63
0:3:31,619 --> 0:3:33,829
okay that is you only obligation


64
0:3:33,829 --> 0:3:36,629
ecstasy showed us knew that he will be
removed


65
0:3:36,629 --> 0:3:37,83
and they will have a new one


66
0:3:37,83 --> 0:3:41,26
that's why we need the government to
look out for its citizens


67
0:3:41,26 --> 0:3:45,989
to represent its citizens had to put a
check on corporations knowing that that


68
0:3:45,989 --> 0:3:49,84
is the nature of corporations say hey
wait a minute up to protect the citizens


69
0:3:49,84 --> 0:3:53,73
sewing at a balance here i think you
should have corporations but the way the


70
0:3:53,73 --> 0:3:57,28
ballots but that balance has been taken
away because of corporations also


71
0:3:57,28 --> 0:3:59,809
figured out hey you know i can make the
most money


72
0:3:59,809 --> 0:4:1,189
right after the government


73
0:4:1,189 --> 0:4:2,3
mhm iso


74
0:4:2,3 --> 0:4:4,819
i think after the government you set up
a system


75
0:4:4,819 --> 0:4:8,589
where the politicians absolutely depend
on you to get reelected


76
0:4:8,589 --> 0:4:11,549
as we told you i believe yesterday on
the show


77
0:4:11,549 --> 0:4:14,459
therebetween race in the senate


78
0:4:14,459 --> 0:4:17,609
stat ten and a half million dollars


79
0:4:17,609 --> 0:4:21,729
has an average guy in town


80
0:4:21,729 --> 0:4:26,619
with democracy red than at any time at
the only way to invest in a race


81
0:4:26,619 --> 0:4:28,65
is if you play ball with these guys


82
0:4:28,65 --> 0:4:32,2
this is how you play ball and this is
how we destroyed our system of


83
0:4:32,2 --> 0:4:35,43
government our schools and everything
else involved


84
0:4:35,43 --> 0:6:35,43
so we gotta fix the system of hope is
worse for
