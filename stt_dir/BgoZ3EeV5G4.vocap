###8 THOBEY CAMPION: Hey, this is Thobey.
###9 We're here in Brooklyn to meet up with ski-masked star and
###12 Delocated mastermind, Jon Glaser.
###13 
###22 THOBEY CAMPION: Cheers by the way.
###23 JON GLASER: Cheers.
###24 And cheers on this one.
###25 
###31 I gave mine wings real quick.
###32 I hope everyone notices that.
###34 Let's get it for both cameras.
###35 Wings.
###36 [MAKING AIRPLANE NOISES]
###41 JON GLASER: I'm just going to be doing that the whole
###42 interview, so everyone get used to that.
###44 If you're not cool with that, I advise to stop watching now.
###47 THOBEY CAMPION: It'll be pretty
###48 helpful for the editors.
###49 [VIDEO PLAYING]
###49 -Don't worry.
###50 Your friends are right here, John.
###52 
###55 -No, you guys don't count.
###56 You're professional relationships.
###58 -I'm a professional relationship?
###60 -David, I have to hang out with you.
###61 All right?
###62 I'm obligated to.
###63 I can't just call you up and be all like, "was-sup bra?
###66 Let's go grab a couple o' fa-laff sandies.
###69 Wash 'em down with some ice cold 'ronas.
###71 Check out some tush." You're my son.
###73 I can't be all like, "was-sup bra?
###75 Da
###76 bra." -I get it.

###78 [MAKING AIRPLANE NOISES]
###81 THOBEY CAMPION: I feel like a shithead for just drinking
###82 beers normally.
###83 JON GLASER: Make your wings.
###84 Make some wings and have some fun.
###88 Here's what you should do.
###89 You should make wings and then after this interview post a
###93 link on the site, like, show us your wings.
###96 And then get people to send in photos.
###98 THOBEY CAMPION: What's interesting about your career
###99 to me is that you're almost more accomplished as, I mean
###104 you're definitely more accomplished as a writer than
###105 someone who's in front of the camera.
###108 Was it inevitable that you would go into writing?
###110 JON GLASER: I never thought I would, honestly.
###112 I love David Rakoff's book Fraud just because that's how
###115 I've always envisioned myself.
###116 I'm not a writer.
###118 And I still don't feel like I necessarily am
###120 even though I do.
###121 But it's not something I envision doing at all.
###124 And even when I got The Dana Carvey Show job I felt like,
###126 this will be cool for now and I'm still
###127 going to pursue acting.
###130 But it's the greatest thing that ever happened to me,
###132 getting that job and opening up a whole other
###134 world of just jobs.
###137 And a second career or even a first career.
###140 But I still feel like I'm an actor, a better actor than I
###143 am a writer but I love doing both.
###146 And especially jobs where I can do both, like Conan, or my
###150 own show now.
###152 THOBEY CAMPION: That was kind of the dream
###152 job at Conan, right?
###153 JON GLASER: Conan was like the dream job, at
###155 least at the time.
###156 Doing Delocated is the ultimate, but Conan was really
###160 just the best job.
###161 So much fun.
###163 Just a great group of people that work there.
###165 But also getting to write and perform and do your
###168 own stuff or not.
###169 To also not perform was great.
###171 You know, you're writing for another
###172 person, of course, Conan.
###173 But the nature of the show, doing all the sketchy bits and
###176 getting to be in them, it was awesome.
###179 Really fun.
###179 THOBEY CAMPION: So, one of the ideas we had for--
###181 JON GLASER: What's the better idea you have?
###184 THOBEY CAMPION: --It was to go and get tattoos.
###187 JON GLASER: Well, we'll see.
###188 I doubt I'm going to get a tattoo but I will be happy to
###191 watch you get a tattoo and--
###192 THOBEY CAMPION: Help me.
###193 JON GLASER: --give input, and give suggestions, and make it
###195 a really good one.
###195 THOBEY CAMPION: Great, great.
###196 I'm excited for it.
###197 JON GLASER: But I agree with you that perhaps these flying
###199 bottles will be a part.
###200 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###201 THOBEY CAMPION: We were thinking that or that bird,
###202 which is actually kind of an amazing, it's just a really
###205 angry pheasant.
###206 JON GLASER: Jesus Christ, this thing?
###208 This one is nice because he certainly looks like he's
###210 angry but you're right he also could be like, hey
###214 ladies, how we doin'?
###215 Right?
###215 He's like, that's what he's doing.
###216 THOBEY CAMPION: What's up?
###217 JON GLASER: He just looks angry.
###218 But once you get to know him you know that's just his face.
###221 [LAUGHTER]
###222 THOBEY CAMPION: That's his normal body structure.
###223 JON GLASER: Yeah, hey guys.
###226 These guys are all psyched.
###229 This is the still photo and they're all kind of like
###231 looking nervous but in the next photo, they're all like,
###233 oh yeah, Larry's here.
###235 THOBEY CAMPION: [INAUDIBLE]
###237 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###239 -Yeah.
###241 So what happens from here?
###243 We get some ninja dudes to follow me around, or what?
###246 -The less you know, the better.
###249 -Let's do that.
###251 That's smarter.
###252 Call of the day, right there.
###254 All right, I'm gonna take off.
###255 I'm out-skies.
###257 So, sayonara.
###259 And I'll see ya "ta-ma-ra."
###262 [END VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###263 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###269 JON GLASER: Very excited to not get a tattoo here.
###271 THOBEY CAMPION: What's up guys?
###273 Thobey.
###274 MALE SPEAKER: Nice to meet you, Thobey.
###274 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###274 THOBEY CAMPION: Nice to meet you.
###275 This is Jon.
###275 CHUCK: Chuck.
###275 Nice to meet you.
###276 JON GLASER: Nice to meet you.
###277 THOBEY CAMPION: We've been doing some light
###278 brainstorming already.
###280 But none of them are as well-thought-out or as
###282 beautiful as these.
###283 I'm still into the whole hawk or falcon from the bar.
###287 CHUCK: These are kind of like the more [INAUDIBLE] ideas.
###288 Some of them will kind of get the juices flowing.
###291 THOBEY CAMPION: What's battling
###292 that snake right there?
###293 CHUCK: That's a good question.
###295 Or you get the lady in the bottle, have
###296 it say mom, or something.
###298 THOBEY CAMPION: Jon.
###298 CHUCK: Jon, yeah.
###300 THOBEY CAMPION: I do like the party hawk idea.
###302 JON GLASER: Party hawk is pretty good.
###304 To me, the funniest thing is, you don't know if this bird is
###306 coming in for the kill or if he's coming in, to put his
###310 arms around his buddies.
###312 MALE SPEAKER: 'Cause that face is good too.
###313 That looks like an angry face or it could easily be a really
###316 intense, what's up man?
###319 THOBEY CAMPION: Yeah, that guy's kinda got it going on.
###320 I like that guy.
###321 CHUCK: OK.
###322 That's cool.
###323 JON GLASER: Here's the three party bird's buddies.
###324 One, two, three.
###328 THOBEY CAMPION: All right, cool.
###329 Let's do it.
###330 CHUCK: You wanna do it?
###330 THOBEY CAMPION: Yeah.
###331 CHUCK: Yeah?
###331 Chris?
###334 THOBEY CAMPION: So now you're into your third season as
###336 executive producer and star of the Adult
###339 Swim TV show, Delocated.
###340 Where did the idea come from for the character?
###344 JON GLASER: The original idea, I had done an incarnation of
###348 this character, before I got hired at Conan, which is an
###352 impressionist who is in the witness protection program,
###355 who really still wanted to perform and get himself out
###357 there so he wore a ski mask and altered his voice.
###360 And the joke was that the impressions
###361 all sounded the same.
###362 It was that stupid voice.
###363 You know, when you hear someone on the news doing a
###365 hidden identity interview.
###366 But so, it was just really as dumb as can be.
###369 Really shitty impressions.
###370 Super hackey comedy.
###372 But he was very confident in it.
###374 So I like that archetype of just this
###376 smug, confident dick.
###378 THOBEY CAMPION: Yeah, he's a dickhead.
###379 JON GLASER: Yeah, real asshole.
###380 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###380 -What the [BLEEP]
###381 are you doing in there, man?
###383 -What are you talking about?
###384 -I'm trying to grandpa my granddaughter, that's what.
###387 This is my weekend, TB.
###390 Just stay outta grandpa time.
###392 [END VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###392 THOBEY CAMPION (OFFSCREEN): You know, the other thing that
###393 struck me right off the bat, was you've essentially limited
###396 your vocal and facial range to your eyes and mouth and a very
###401 small spectrum of vocal inflection.
###404 JON GLASER: Basically, I think the key to it actually is the
###407 mask we have.
###408 Because the eye holes are really big, as
###410 is the mouth hole.
###411 So I still feel like you get a sense of a face and you do get
###414 a sense of expression with the eyes and the mouth.
###418 So I don't think you lose too much.
###419 And for me it was never an issue, like the ski
###422 mask and the voice.
###423 I always looked at it as, this is just how he looks and this
###426 is how he talks.
###427 Like that's his face.
###428 That's his voice.
###429 THOBEY CAMPION: And what's in store for season three?
###432 JON GLASER: My character just decides to play pro-ball.
###436 And he dedicates himself to trying out for teams, working
###441 on his dunks, shoots about 1,000 free throws a day.
###444 So if you like basketball, and if you like the art of
###448 training for basketball, you're
###449 gonna love season three.
###452 THOBEY CAMPION: So it's part of the structural--
###453 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###453 JON GLASER: You gotta learn to go to your left.
###455 You gotta learn to go to your left.
###456 And if you're a lefty, you gotta learn
###458 to go to your right.
###459 Use your opposite hand.
###460 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###461 CHUCK: Sorry, but you wanna continue the interview but you
###463 wanna stand up and then I'll put the stencil on you?
###465 THOBEY CAMPION: Yeah.
###465 CHUCK: Is that all right?
###466 JON GLASER: Here we go.
###466 THOBEY CAMPION: All right.
###467 JON GLASER: Buddies.
###467 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###468 JON GLASER: Yeah.
###470 Oh, you have to shave.
###471 THOBEY CAMPION: It's my favorite part of the tattoo.
###473 JON GLASER: Fuck, that's awesome.
###474 CHUCK: That's a bird of prey.
###475 It's an eagle, right?
###476 This is what makes you a man today.
###477 JON GLASER: We don't know what it is.
###478 That's the tattoo.
###479 Is it an eagle?
###480 Is it a hawk?
###482 Is it a falcon?
###483 That's fucking cool.
###484 CHUCK: What do you think, though?
###484 It that the right spot for it?
###486 JON GLASER: My input is that, looking real good.
###488 Now what I'm going to do, and I'm going to give you guys,
###489 this is for free, I'm gonna give you guys a hotshot.
###491 I'm gonna say looking good and what would be nice is if you
###494 could frame it and shoot right through this
###497 signal and see the bird.
###499 Looking good.
###501 THOBEY CAMPION: It makes my skinny arm
###502 look fucking bad ass.
###503 JON GLASER: This is a pretty good tattoo.
###505 Buddies?
###506 That should be a sports bar.
###508 Buddies, question mark.
###509 Where you walk in like, Hmm, what's going to happen.
###512 Fuck, man.
###513 CHUCK: Are you still good for the interview, right?
###514 THOBEY CAMPION: Yeah, I'm all right.
###515 CHUCK: There we go.
###515 [TATTOO GUN BUZZING]
###516 THOBEY CAMPION: There was a great article that was talking
###517 about the accessibility of the show.
###522 In comparison to the general slate of
###525 programming on Adult Swim.
###527 Which I think is hilarious considering the main
###530 character--
###532 they're calling it accessible and the main character is
###533 wearing a mask.
###535 JON GLASER: It mirrors the most traditional sitcom as far
###538 as accessibility goes.
###539 And it's 30 minutes also, which allows it to be a little
###542 more expanded and breathe a little bit as opposed to the
###544 shorter form shows they do predominantly, which are just
###547 shorter, faster, and tighter, and crazier.
###549 But I also agree, for good and not for bad.
###552 This is pretty painful, right?
###555 THOBEY CAMPION: When, I talk to you--
###555 JON GLASER: I'm watching your face and I'm seeing--
###556 THOBEY CAMPION: When I talk to you, I forget about it.
###557 And when I look down, it hits me.
###560 CHUCK: How's it looking?
###561 All right?
###562 Everybody good?
###563 I'm doing a little thing.
###565 His talons are doing the thing.
###566 JON GLASER: Wanna get this?
###567 So that is supposed to be the talon-claw version of this.
###570 MALE SPEAKER: We're going to have to tattoo
###571 some dots right there.
###571 CHUCK: That could've gone horribly wrong by the way.
###573 JON GLASER: It went horribly right.
###575 THOBEY CAMPION: Is your son a fan of the show?
###577 JON GLASER: He's not even six.
###578 So he knows what the show is and he's come
###580 to visit the set.
###581 He gets into it.
###582 And he's pretty funny.
###584 THOBEY CAMPION: Does he get the concept of it?
###586 JON GLASER: I don't know if he gets the concept
###586 but he enjoys it.
###588 They made these great billboards for the show.
###590 And it was me in my underwear and the ski mask and we took
###593 him into the city to show it to him and take some pictures.
###596 And we showed him these billboards.
###599 And said, who's that?
###600 And he said, Daddy.
###602 That was his reaction to a guy in a ski mask and his
###605 underwear on a billboard, with these dead eyes.
###610 Daddy!
###610 It was really cute and hilarious.
###612 Very funny.
###613 CHUCK: Yeah, it looks good, huh?
###614 Like that shading.
###615 THOBEY CAMPION: How do you do those lines like that?
###617 CHUCK: It's all whip shading actually.
###618 THOBEY CAMPION: Whip shading?
###619 CHUCK: Yep.
###619 Whipping it.
###620 Whipping it out.
###622 THOBEY CAMPION: Is it basically skipping over my
###622 skin right now?
###623 CHUCK: Yeah.
###623 JON GLASER: Buddies?
###625 [LAUGHTER]
###628 MALE SPEAKER: Hey, buddies.
###631 JON GLASER: Just cut to a month from now.
###632 Hi, so, my girlfriend and I were sitting at the bar and we
###637 just wanted to ask you about your tattoo of
###640 the eagle and buddies?
###642 THOBEY CAMPION: Well, I met this guy, Jon Glaser.
###645 JON GLASER: Buddies?
###645 That's awesome man, that's really funny.
###648 THOBEY CAMPION: You did a great job with
###648 the creative direction.
###649 And good luck on season three of Delocated.
###652 JON GLASER: Thanks very much.
###653 THOBEY CAMPION: Cheers, man.
###653 JON GLASER: It turned out awesome.
###654 THOBEY CAMPION: Buddies?
###655 JON GLASER: Buddies?
###656 THOBEY CAMPION: Buddies?
