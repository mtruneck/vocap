###11 Oh hello, sorry. War! We love it, right?
###16 Blowing stuff up, watching people suffer and die, it's exciting!
###20 Violence, domination, retribution and other attributes of this competitive
###25 warring fascination clearly dominates our media
###28 with films, television and other expressions constantly
###31 glorifying and reinforcing this gesture of conflict.
###35 In fact, it has been found that by the time an average kid
###38 reaches the age of 14 in the West,
###40 he or she has visually witnessed over 8,000 depicted acts of murder.
###46 Given all of this, it might make you wonder:
###48 Does art imitate life, or does life imitate art?
###53 Likewise, isn't it interesting how most of us in America sleep quite well at night
###57 while our military forces routinely invade,
###60 slaughter and steal from other nations at will;
###63 as, of course, all global empires have done historically,
###66 with, this time, a global civilian death toll well over 1 million
###70 in the past decade alone, many of them women and children.
###74 Yet, the same American culture shudders in horror and confusion
###79 when some dude stumbles into an American schoolyard and randomly wipes out
###82 a couple dozen or so kids.
###86 I ask you, by what measure do we differentiate importance
###90 when it comes to the death of different groups of people?
###92 What makes us so special?
###95 While history is certainly full of xenophobic, racist, religious
###99 and nationalist conceits which have served as convenient justifications for
###104 external dehumanization, subjugation and imperial power abuse,
###108 a rather unnoticed yet profound scientific truth has also emerged:
###113 Today, every person on Earth can trace his or her lineage
###117 back to a single common female ancestor who lived about 200,000 years ago.
###123 'Mitochondrial Eve', she is now called,
###126 proving indeed that we are truly one family.
###130 Likewise, the planet Earth, the habitat this family shares, it knows no division.
###135 It is a unified, synergistic system at every turn, fully connected.
###140 It has no idea what a nation, a politician or a racist is.
###144 It has no notion of any such human conceit, for that matter;
###148 for division simply doesn't exist
###150 in the order of nature by which we're all invariably subject.
###156 Mark Twain once wrote
###158 "Man is the only Patriot. He sets himself apart in his country,
###162 under his own flag, and sneers at the other nations,
###165 and keeps multitudinous uniformed assassins on hand at heavy expense
###170 to grab slices of other people's countries,
###172 and keep them from grabbing slices of his.
###175 And in the intervals between campaigns he washes the blood off his hands
###180 and works for 'the universal brotherhood of man'- with his mouth."
###185 While we all love to give lip service to the idea of peace and collaboration,
###191 holding up icons such as Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.
###195 something underneath the surface is clearly holding us back.
###199 Yes, we know for a fact
###201 that if we took the total war budgets of all the nations on Earth
###205 (tens of trillions of dollars over the past quarter century alone)
###209 and applied that energy-producing capital towards creating
###213 an advanced, intelligent, efficient system of Earth/Human management,
###219 not only would poverty and most deprivation be removed from our lives on the global scale
###223 our progressive capacity to create, build and improve
###226 rather than pillage, seek and destroy
###229 could catapult the human family into an age of prosperity
###233 never before seen.
###235 Just imagine. If we took America's Pentagon or Britain's Northwood
###241 along with all the world's advanced military centers,
###244 kicked all the army freaks out...
###247 OK, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be harsh.
###249 I guess we have to do something with them.
###251 Maybe we can just take them all and place them in the Grand Canyon
###255 and just let them beat the piss out of each other,
###258 and hopefully they'll get it out of their systems and move on.
###261 I don't know, we'll figure that out later.
###264 But we, as the intelligent, mature human family
###267 now interested in improving the lives of all,
###269 we use that incredible technology to help assist true developmental progress.
###275 Imagine if the Manhattan Project, which harnessed about 130,000 people,
###280 mostly scientists and technicians, was dedicated not
###284 to building a bomb that could destroy on a scale never before seen;
###288 but rather, utilizing that collaborative drive to solve true global problems,
###294 perhaps those very problems
###296 which are causing the interest in war to begin with.
###300 Today, the hyper-glorified, romanticized obsession with competition,
###304 advantage and conflict has made it into almost every facet of our lives.
###308 Not only do we declare war against virtually everything that annoys us:
###313 'the war on drugs', 'the war on poverty', 'the war on crime',
###316 'the war on terrorism', 'the war on cancer', you name it;
###320 we also, apart from the near constant nationalist wars,
###324 live in a perpetual state of common war or 'class war'
###328 where we battle each other on a daily basis
###331 for unnecessary economic survival and delusions of status.
###336 The fact is, something has been set in motion
###339 that keeps us all on a multilevel war path.
###342 Something in our psychology and, hence, sociology is constantly pushing us
###346 into justifications of these patterns, and as this episode will argue
###351 that something appears to reside at the very foundation
###354 of the socioeconomic condition itself:
###357 a foundation which has given rise to an ever-expanding destructive neurosis
###362 a neurosis clearly characteristic of a culture in decline.

###395 Breaking news
###403 This just in: The President has finished an emergency session at the White House
###407 where he announced that the security focus of his administration
###409 will be moving away from the global war on terror,
###412 instead, focusing all available resources against something the administration
###416 has deemed a larger threat to US and international security
###419 than anything recognized before: Nature itself.
###422 That's right, Dodge, the newly declared war against Nature
###426 will be usurping funds from the Department of Homeland Security
###429 effectively replacing it with a new department, the Department of...
###433 I think I'm reading this right:
###435 "Fuck The Earth And The Science It Rode In On."
###439 That's correct, Summer, the administration has already appointed a head
###442 to this new department, the CEO of Monsanto Corporation, Satan himself.
###447 When questioned regarding concerns about a possible conflict of interest
###450 of the new appointee, the Obama administration responded:
###453 "Monsanto's reputation of challenging the vast power of this intolerant,
###457 bullying force that goes by the terrorist name 'Natural Science'
###461 holds great potential for our victory.
###463 We feel if anyone can take down these insurgent laws
###465 which restrict our God-given freedom, it is the professional experience
###469 of our true lord and master: the Prince of Darkness.
###472 We've just been informed that a press conference is now underway
###476 with the Pentagon's spokesperson answering questions.
###478 We now go live to the White House.
###480 As the President said earlier, the greatest barrier to US interests
###484 has been a constant state of offensive interference by this rogue network.
###488 Nature has been forcing its will against our freedom for long enough.
###492 Our economy, our values, the American way of life, it's not negotiable.
###496 Either Nature concedes to our interests and stops terrorizing us
###500 with its hatred of our liberty,
###502 or we will be forced to destroy it.
###505 Next question.
###508 Hi. Joe, from L.A. Times:
###510 Don't you feel it could be a bad idea to move against
###513 a force which has historically never been overcome
###516 or even phased by human action?
###519 Also, I understand Nature has given a set of demands which, if met,
###522 would cease many of its counterattacks.
###525 Has the administration considered just meeting these demands?
###528 Listen Joe, we don't negotiate with terrorists, and I've seen Nature's demands,
###533 full of queer Communist propaganda such a balance and sustainability.
###537 It even demands that we shut down our infinite growth consumption economy
###540 to make way for something where we are to be slaves to some oppressive
###543 natural regeneration respect.
###546 Listen, I didn't spend 35 years defending this country
###550 to have some metaphysical terrorist group with science on its side
###554 ruin what has made this nation great.
###557 No further questions.
###561 (P. Joseph) When we think of war, we usually think about gun-wielding soldiers,
###565 tanks, flame throwers, fancy metal honors and other theatrics.
###569 Yet, when we step outside the theater,
###572 digging deeper in our examination of the world around us
###575 we find that war is actually a state of mind,
###578 a reaction, driven by some type of competitive condition.
###582 If we had to classify the different levels of large scale competition,
###586 we might end up with two broad categories:
###588 imperial war and class war.
###591 Imperial war, otherwise known as national war,
###594 is when an aggressor nation decides to invade some other nation,
###597 justified by some form of perceived threat.
###601 Back in the day, this threat often appeared as purely ideological with
###604 religious groups battling it out to make sure they were in good with God,
###609 while in a mildly more literate scientific world today,
###612 the threat is, more often than not, pitched as direct to each of us.
###616 Such as, a rogue nation getting a nuclear weapon
###619 to blow up your grandmother's bingo tournament
###622 or perhaps a crazed state-funded hijacker crashing a plane
###625 into your favorite taco stand (bastards!).
###628 Regardless, in virtually every historical case, the justification for war
###632 put forward for public digestion has always been far from the truth.
###638 You see, there is indeed always a true threat,
###640 but that threat has little to do with the vast majority of the population.
###644 Instead, it is a threat that bothers only the highest echelons
###648 of social hierarchy, an elitist upper class self-preservation
###652 based around a loss of broad power and control.
###656 When was the last time the citizenry actually cried out for war?
###659 It doesn't happen, only the politicians go for it.
###663 Since the establishment would be hard-pressed to explain to their citizens
###667 that they are going to invade some nation for its natural resources,
###671 maintain currency domination, enable freedom for transnational corporations,
###676 along with other generally economic concerns
###679 to secure the interests of the upper 1%,
###682 various superficial, psychological ploys are used instead.
###686 The most common today is the moral crusade:
###689 We must not tolerate this regime using military force against its own people.
###693 (P. Joseph) coupled with some basic yet irrational threat of attack.
###697 Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat,
###700 not just to the US, but to Iran's neighbors and our allies.
###704 (P. Joseph) In the words of famed sociologist Thorstein Veblen, writing from 1917:
###710 "Any warlike enterprise that is hopeful to be entered on
###713 must have the moral sanction of the community.
###716 It consequently becomes the first concern of the warlike statesman
###720 to put this moral force in train for the adventure on which he is bent."
###725 You see, a large part of the imperial war is the psychological war
###728 against the domestic citizenry itself.
###732 The US government spends billions of dollars every year
###735 on public relations and recruitment alone,
###738 producing signs like this one:
###740 "For our nation, for us all."
###743 Is it me, or does that sound like Orwellian doublespeak?
###747 If it's 'for our nation', then it clearly isn't 'for us all', as the human species
###750 is the closest thing we have to 'all'. If it's referring to all of us in the nation
###754 that would be hideously redundant, right? I think what they mean to say
###758 in this warm, loving community slogan is:
###762 "For our nation, screw the rest."
###767 Cooking with Pepé
###772 Hello! Welcome to the show! My name is Pepé.
###775 Today, I've got something very special for you,
###777 a true international delicacy:
###780 War!
###783 To prepare for war is a very delicate matter.
###786 The first thing we need to do is create some spicy tension
###790 to put fire in your belly.
###793 The first ingredient we need is a well-tempered provocation.
###800 Provocations are, of course, seasonal and subject to personal taste.
###803 So may I suggest something along the lines [of]
###807 a marinated Gulf of Tonkin,
###812 a robust Pearl Harbor,
###818 and if you're feeling bored, a bustling 9/11.
###824 Then, we let that cook for a bit and prepare our second ingredient,
###830 a special sauté to give life to our fiery dish:
###834 the mainstream media.
###844 Can you just smell the propaganda and delectable ignorance?
###851 After we get a nice sizzle going,
###853 we now add our final, most important ingredient:
###858 the delicious soldiers.
###860 The most ripe soldiers tend to grow in the more poor,
###863 rural areas of the world, often with limited literacy.
###868 You want to pick them around
###871 18, 19, because their brains are very immature and quite yummy,
###876 perfect for participation in our war meal.
###881 We mix it all together.
###890 Perhaps add a few, some preservatives like patriotism
###895 (not too much)
###897 jingoism,
###899 and, of course, our very special secret sauce.
###910 OK! And we are ready! The moment you have all been waiting for.
###922 I present to you the greatest international delicacy of all time: War.
###930 Bon appétit.
###932 (P. Joseph) Perhaps one of the most amusing aspects of national war
###936 is the circus-like pageantry and ceremonialism.
###939 Cute costumes, little hats, shiny pieces of metal,
###942 various parades and official posturing
###945 and all adornments and theatrics that give this air of honor and authority.
###951 Of course, this is not to dismiss the true sacrifice
###953 of those who have given their lives in war, as there are always two sides.
###958 This true honor comes from a position of working to help others,
###962 not exploit them. Just as we hold the bravery of a firefighter
###966 who enters a burning building to save a child in high regard,
###970 the intention to help society through military service is indeed a noble gesture.
###975 Even though, sadly enough, 99% of those who enter the military
###979 with such noble intentions are more often than not being exploited
###984 for the criminal purposes of the corporate state.
###988 Still, you have to be impressed by the skill to give credence to an idea
###993 merely because of the nature of its presentation.
###996 In fact, whether it's academia, the news media, government itself
###1000 the military or anything else in society, our culture tends to believe
###1004 and respect people merely because of their presentation, confidence and rhetoric,
###1010 not the actual meaning or reasoning of the communication itself.
###1020 Did you know that the first television sets of the 1950s
###1024 were actually supposed to be used as prosthetic replacement heads
###1027 to give new hope for those who had been tragically decapitated?
###1030 But, technology, weight and
###1032 cord length being what they were at the time, it failed.
###1035 Luckily, they could play other things besides the faces of the deceased
###1039 and TV sets sold nationwide, and it's all true!
###1043 You know why? Because you heard it from some guy in a tie.
###1051 In the end, once the traditional, propagandized illusions in defense
###1056 of the act of organized human murder and resource theft have been overridden,
###1060 dismissing such shallow justifications as paternalism, honor and protectionism,
###1066 we realize that war today is actually an inherent characteristic
###1070 of the propertied, scarcity-driven business system.
###1073 Major General Smedley D. Butler,
###1075 one of the most notable and decorated officers in US history
###1079 stated the following with respect to the business of war in 1935:
###1084 "I spent 33 years and 4 months in active military service and during that period
###1089 I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for big business,
###1093 for Wall Street and the bankers.
###1095 In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.
###1098 I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico
###1101 safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba
###1105 a decent place for the National City boys to collect revenues in.
###1109 I helped in the raping of a half a dozen Central American republics
###1113 for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua
###1116 for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902 -1912.
###1121 I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916.
###1125 I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903.
###1129 In China in 1927, I helped see to it that
###1132 Standard Oil went on its way unmolested.
###1135 Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints.
###1139 The best he could do was operate his racket in three districts.
###1142 I operated on three continents." -Major General Smedley D. Butler
###1146 Given all of this, it's unique how the general public tends to separate
###1150 the day-to-day competitive business acumen
###1153 from the severe form of competitive violent warfare,
###1157 when there is very good evidence to show that they are deeply intermeshed.
###1161 To gain some perspective on this, we now welcome back our resident guru,
###1165 Louie the Logic Gremlin.
###1167 Ah! Before we get into the questions, I do have a letter here
###1170 that I would like to read to you and get your opinion on.
###1173 It reads: "Dear Peter, I really enjoy the new show.
###1178 I think it is helping get these important messages across.
###1181 However, I am disappointed with the crude Louie the Logic Gremlin character,
###1186 as it is just irritating and hideously stupid.
###1190 Also, would you please stop eating when you are speaking in the show.
###1194 It's really disgusting and annoying.
###1197 Rock on. Joe."
###1199 I'm sorry, Joe. Louie, what do you think about that?
###1203 Aesthetic orientation is largely a cultural phenomenon.
###1205 Your decision to directly agitate your audience is odd,
###1208 but not without its communicative merit.
###1210 Toats! [Totally] Sorry, Joe, shit stays.
###1217 All right, so what's the skinny on war, man?
###1221 Aren't we just crazy animals that have to be in endless conflict
###1225 with each other due to our biology or something?
###1228 While the conflict reaction is predictable in our evolutionary psychology,
###1231 the assumption of inevitably is absurdly false.
###1233 Human nature exists as a propensity of interaction with conditions.
###1236 If you reward competition and produce scarcity
###1239 as we do today, you will perpetuate a conflict propensity.
###1242 If you work to ease stress and reward balance,
###1244 you will generate a collaborative propensity.  - OK, I see what you're saying.
###1247 You're saying that war is actually a system consequence?
###1251 Correct. The real underlying conflict is the war against social balance itself.
###1254 National war is really a form of class war.
###1257 Just as we have an economic hierarchy from lower to upper classes in America,
###1260 the world is stratified in the same way, for the same reasons.
###1263 In this case with terms such as
###1265 "super-powers", "sub-powers" and "vassal states".  - Interesting.
###1268 So, how do we resolve this war tendency then?
###1272 Remove the social reinforcements of it.
###1274 If society shifts to rewarding balance, abundance and collaboration,
###1277 then your species may have a chance.
###1279 Otherwise, you people are likely fucked, as you are
###1281 too immature right now to handle your own technological power.   - Gotcha
###1285 Well, thank you for your time, Louie.
###1287 To gain some public consensus on the issue,
###1290 we now turn live to our east coast 'Culture in Decline' correspondent,
###1293 Big Scottie D, who's live in New York City
###1296 to talk with people about what they think of war.
###1300 Well, thank you, Peter. I am here in New York City
###1303 on a beautiful cold day and
###1306 I'm going to try to find some people to maybe talk to.
###1310 Excuse me, excuse me, Ma'am, would you like to...
###1312 Excuse me,  Sir... Sir, would you like to talk about the war?
###1315 - What?  - Would you like to talk about the war, Sir?  - No.
###1317 - Would you like to talk about the war today?
###1320 War? No?
###1322 Sir, would you like to talk about the war?  - God bless.
###1324 - No? The war? Please? The war?
###1327 Anyone who would like to talk about the war?
###1332 I am just sick of this, Peter. You're sending me on these assignments.
###1335 It's freaking freezing out here!
###1338 I'd rather be in a bar getting drunk and then maybe I can do this, all right?
###1342 I think there's a bar up here.
###1344 Let me just grab my shit.
###1346 You know, I'm just sick of this.
###1348 Goddammit!
###1353 I said I am done, man! I am done!
###1356 Get some other monkey, OK?
###1359 There's trash and shit all over the place!
###1361 What does Peter wants to know about? He wants to know about the war!
###1365 Well, I am sick of it, man!
###1368 I've got to calm down. I just need a drink.
###1371 - Any of you are Occupy Wall Street types?

###1438 Peter Joseph has asked us to stand out here in the freezing cold
###1442 and talk about the difference of classes here, but
###1445 he is sitting in his LA loft, relaxing
###1448 with his big flat screen TV.
###1468 New video message!
###1476 - Yeah, fuck him!
###1478 - Fuck Peter Joseph!
###1480 The only thing that we don't have a war on, is a war on war,
###1485 and I think that, as peace activists,we don't want to fight;
###1488 so, we are going to end up loosing, due to irony!
###1494 Final thoughts:
###1496 How do we think about resolution of something as detrimental as national war,
###1500 when, on the micro level, we in society actually praise, reward
###1504 and reinforce the same basic underlying competitive drive?
###1508 Generally, when faced with such a question, people tend to play the morality card,
###1512 as though a matter of degree is what's relevant
###1515 not the philosophical basis itself.
###1518 Usually this vague distinction is gestured to the effect that
###1522 competition is good, but we should never go too far and be violent in any way.
###1527 Then, of course, the question becomes "What constitutes violence?"
###1532 What if, instead of physically attacking you directly,
###1534 I put you into a subtle yet deeply toxic condition,
###1537 where your life is shorten by decades via heart disease, cancer,
###1541 mental illness, and other such consequences.
###1543 Would that be considered violent?
###1545 And what if such intentions were not even directly malicious,
###1549 such as a lower class, desperate single mother
###1552 forced to work three jobs to keep up,
###1554 who fails one night to provide proper supervision for her child,
###1558 resulting in the death of her child?
###1560 I ask you "What is the true origin of the resulting death,
###1565 and does that qualify as violent?"
###1568 To paraphrase Mahatma Gandhi
###1571 "Poverty is the worst form of violence."
###1574 You see, the real war going on is not as obvious as many think.
###1578 The real war exists in the very structure of our society itself,
###1583 something public health officials have now termed
###1585 'Structural Violence':
###1587 a war, in fact, against public health and balance itself,
###1591 constantly producing casualty after casualty in its hidden oppression;
###1596 and this form of violence today kills more people
###1599 than every type of direct behavioral violence put together.
###1604 Its origin? A social system
###1606 literally built upon competition and exploitation itself
###1610 So, for all you noble activists out there, for all of you
###1613 who pile into protest zones each time a new national war emerges
###1617 and yell at the top of your lungs, keep in mind,
###1620 that you are only targeting a symptom of a larger sociological problem
###1625 and until the activist community realizes this, I am sorry to say:
###1629 your protests have no long-term consequence,
###1632 as they do not address the root problem.
###1635 But, on the bright side, it's still great entertainment, right?
###1639 so let's keep watching this bizarre human experiment,
###1642 certainly the greatest, yet worst reality show of all time, for sure.
###1645 I am Peter Joseph, and yes I, like you,
###1648 am an agent and victim of a culture in decline.
###1655 Where is the credit scene?
###1657 What? What do you mean "Bob didn't get hurt"?
###1664 I'm sorry, Bob.
###1666 It's the format of the show.
###1671 "Neither the great political and financial power structures of the world,
###1674 nor the specialization-blinded professionals nor the population in general
###1678 realizes that... it is now highly feasible to take care of everyone on earth
###1681 at a higher standard of living than they have ever known.
###1684 It no longer has to be you or me. Selfishness is unnecessary
###1687 and henceforth unrationalizable as mandated by survival.
###1690 War is obsolete." - R. Buckminster Fuller
###1700 Written and edited by Peter Joseph while severely constipated
