###33 Our family would like to welcome you to our home in Genero Herrera, Peru.
###37 320 kilometers upriver outside of Iquitos,
###42 this tranquil village in the Amazon is home to a natural community of beautiful
###46 people,
###48 sacred medicinal plants,
###50 and the shamans who ritually administer them,
###53 including native-born Don Eloy Navarro-Java.
###58 With over twenty five years of experience,
###61 and a direct lineage to several generations of respected shamans,
###65 Eloy brings powerful healing,
###68 wisdom,
###69 light,
###70 and love to every ceremony,
###72 allowing friends and community members
###75 to experience direct teaching from the Divine plant spirits themselves--
###80 a true gift from God.
###84 Shaman Eloy and I welcome you to our home
###87 where we live happily with his children
###90 Tatiana,
###91 and Jheffri,
###94 as well as various other apprentices and guests.
###96 Besides being a loving partner in the medicine,
###98 my role is to serve as a bridge
###101 between the Peruvian shamanic culture
###104 and the hearing and Deaf Western worlds,
###107 interpreting Spanish,
###109 English,
###110 and American Sign Language,
###112  as well as apprenticing
###114 to one day become a shamaness myself.
###116 My background is in psychology
###119 at Gallaudet University as a Hearing Undergraduate,
###122 spiritual development at Iyanla Vanzant's
###122 Inner Visions Institute for Spiritual Development,
###128 and Andean Shamanism
###130 at Shamanic Healing Institute
###132 in Savage, Maryland.
###135 Various other apprentices and friends
###138 share in the medicine throughout the year,
###141 including Eloy's oldest son, Jolker,
###143 Ashley Weller,
###145 Yasmin Vilchez,
###147 and many, many more.
###149 Together, we share in the gathering,
###152 preperation,
###154 and celebration
###155 of the sacred Master Teacher plant,
###158 Ayahuasca.
###160 Being one of the world's sacred power centers,
###163 the Amazon births the combination
###165 of various potent,
###166 healing,
###167 sacred medicinal teaching plants,
###170 to create one of the most lovingly intense,
###173 powerful,
###174 life changing spiritual paths available--
###177 Ayahuasca Shamanism.
###182 The plants are gathered with love and consciousness,
###185 carefully cooked into a tea,
###187 which is taken in physically
###189 to commence the ancient ceremony.
###193 (shaman chanting)
###197 As the plants of pure, Divine light
###200 make physical contact with the body,
###202 they search to purge out anything unlike themselves,
###206 including crossed or dark energies,
###208 entities and spirits,
###211 negative belief systems and emotions,
###213 as well as various physical ailments.
###216 These God-centered spirits
###219 then instill light and love,
###221 strength and protection,
###223 and profound, Divine wisdom into the person,
###226 who is then forever changed.
###230 The Third Eye is naturally open the entire time,
###234 so that the person can see in clear,
###237 physical-spiritual vision,
###240 exactly what is happening throughout the process.
###243 By the opening of the Third Eye,
###246 the person can improve psychic abilities,
###248 increase healing skills,
###251 and tap into wisdom that is rarely attainable
###254 from the physical plane.
###256 The energetic body is rebalanced,
###258 the chakras are realigned,
###260 and the aura comes out very strong.
###263 There are infinite levels to this spiritual training.
###268 To further strengthen the body, mind, and spirit,
###272 apprentices and shamans alike practice shamanic dieting,
###276 where 8-40 day periods are taken with limited food types,
###281 abstaining from salt, sugar, alcohol, and sexual activity
###288 in order to absorb and integrate various plant medicines
###292 into the body, strengthening and protecting it
###296 physically and spiritually,
###298 in order to prepare for new levels on one's path.
###302 Optional shamanic diets are available to
###304 all who feel called to participate.
###307 In addition to the plant medicines,
###310 Don Eloy is a military trained jungle survival expert,
###314 and a master of plant identification,
###316 and both of these courses are offered optionally as well.
###320 Weight release programs,
###322 spiritual life coaching,
###324 and basic Spanish and Sign Language tutoring
###327 are also available.
###329 We offer various programs here at Infinite Light,
###332 ranging from the Basic 9-Day Program,
###335 to monthly discounted apprenticeships,
###338 to 3-12 month Total Life Renewal programs.
###343 All who feel called to apprentice are welcome to do so.
###346 Eloy also offers Distance Healing
###349 for those outside of Peru at minimal cost.
###353 The Basic Program starts in Iquitos,
###356 where we will pick you up at the airport,
###358 assist you with hotel or hostel accommodations,
###361 and on the first official day,
###363 gather for either the overnight freighter
###367 or two hour speedboat ride to the village.
###369 All guests share our home,
###371 which is located just two minutes from the tranquil,
###374 cascading river.
###377 There's a beautiful nature preserve to explore,
###379 plants to gather,
###381 kids to play with,
###382 and plenty of time to relax
###385 and process the entire experience.
###387 Creative people are encouraged
