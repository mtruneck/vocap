0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:8,802



2
0:0:8,802 --> 0:0:10,24
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, definitely.


3
0:0:10,24 --> 0:0:12,95
We both want to get high.


4
0:0:12,95 --> 0:0:15,65
Betel nut, bing lang, is an
amphetamine you get up.


5
0:0:15,65 --> 0:0:16,31
It's tingly.


6
0:0:16,31 --> 0:0:20,14
I remember the first time I ate
chewing tobacco, I drank a


7
0:0:20,14 --> 0:0:23,69
half bottle of Stoli and then
puked all over this chick on


8
0:0:23,69 --> 0:0:26,91
family day at the University
of Pittsburgh.


9
0:0:26,91 --> 0:0:30,7
So I hope this doesn't
end the same way.


10
0:0:30,7 --> 0:0:55,744



11
0:0:55,744 --> 0:0:56,994
-Eddie Huang.


12
0:0:56,994 --> 0:0:59,62



13
0:0:59,62 --> 0:1:2,25
DAVID: They lost our tripod,
so we might have to


14
0:1:2,25 --> 0:1:3,56
rent one out here.


15
0:1:3,56 --> 0:1:5,365
EDDIE HUANG: We haven't been
here an hour and the dude


16
0:1:5,365 --> 0:1:6,41
already got jacked.


17
0:1:6,41 --> 0:1:8,385
It's not looking good.


18
0:1:8,385 --> 0:1:11,0
This dude's doing calisthenics
with a strap-on.


19
0:1:11,0 --> 0:1:25,2



20
0:1:25,2 --> 0:1:27,84
OK, George, I will tell you
when we see a good one.


21
0:1:27,84 --> 0:1:30,8
All right, pull up, George,
I'm going to open my door.


22
0:1:30,8 --> 0:1:32,8



23
0:1:32,8 --> 0:1:36,746
Hello, hallelujah, holla back,
women like a bing lang.


24
0:1:36,746 --> 0:1:37,22
-Bing lang.


25
0:1:37,22 --> 0:1:38,22
EDDIE HUANG: Good.


26
0:1:38,22 --> 0:1:39,39
Uh-huh.


27
0:1:39,39 --> 0:1:41,2
Yes.


28
0:1:41,2 --> 0:1:45,9
The most famous Taiwan marketing
retail shit is betel


29
0:1:45,9 --> 0:1:48,23
nut beauties, all right?


30
0:1:48,23 --> 0:1:52,22
Betel nut is a very popular
amphetamine and it's like a


31
0:1:52,22 --> 0:1:55,15
kind of chewing tobacco, but
it gets you really up.


32
0:1:55,15 --> 0:1:57,84
It's very popular all throughout
Asia, but Taiwan is


33
0:1:57,84 --> 0:1:59,86
famous for betel nut beauties.


34
0:1:59,86 --> 0:2:2,41
And I mean, we don't really
have a beauty here.


35
0:2:2,41 --> 0:2:7,18
This one clearly has seen
better days, b.


36
0:2:7,18 --> 0:2:10,789
So they take rice wine and they
put other things, like


37
0:2:10,789 --> 0:2:14,3
amphetamines that'll get you
up, get you excited, and


38
0:2:14,3 --> 0:2:16,43
everybody has their own
little mixture.


39
0:2:16,43 --> 0:2:19,12
And the trick with the betel
nut is, you've got to, just


40
0:2:19,12 --> 0:2:22,1
like this, bite the top off.


41
0:2:22,1 --> 0:2:25,24
You want to chew, and you want
to spit out the first, right?


42
0:2:25,24 --> 0:2:26,26
Just like you're cooking.


43
0:2:26,26 --> 0:2:27,5
Throw out the first.


44
0:2:27,5 --> 0:2:28,5
And then you just chew it.


45
0:2:28,5 --> 0:2:30,9
It's like chewing tobacco.


46
0:2:30,9 --> 0:2:32,83
It kinda just gets
you zooming.


47
0:2:32,83 --> 0:2:35,19
I try not to do it too much
because, as you can see,


48
0:2:35,19 --> 0:2:37,89
George, come here,
smile George.


49
0:2:37,89 --> 0:2:38,61
See?


50
0:2:38,61 --> 0:2:40,637
Before, after.


51
0:2:40,637 --> 0:2:44,77
[LAUGH]


52
0:2:44,77 --> 0:2:46,57
I'm a kidnap her, feed
her to my mattress.


53
0:2:46,57 --> 0:2:47,24
Thank you.


54
0:2:47,24 --> 0:2:48,22
[SPEAKING CHINESE].


55
0:2:48,22 --> 0:2:48,99
-Bye-bye.


56
0:2:48,99 --> 0:2:50,24
EDDIE HUANG: Bye-bye.


57
0:2:50,24 --> 0:2:56,7



58
0:2:56,7 --> 0:2:58,31
Wait, didn't we already
cop from this shorty?


59
0:2:58,31 --> 0:3:1,926



60
0:3:1,926 --> 0:3:4,14
Oh watch out, be careful,
be careful.


61
0:3:4,14 --> 0:3:5,51
They will run you over, b.


62
0:3:5,51 --> 0:3:10,29
This is one of many night
markets in Taiwan, but Shilin


63
0:3:10,29 --> 0:3:12,1
is definitely the most famous.


64
0:3:12,1 --> 0:3:15,4
Yo, this is the always imitated,
never duplicated Hot


65
0:3:15,4 --> 0:3:18,19
Star large fried chicken,
all right?


66
0:3:18,19 --> 0:3:20,29
You'll see they put a little
seasoning on here.


67
0:3:20,29 --> 0:3:23,22
There's chili powder, there's a
little five spice, salt and


68
0:3:23,22 --> 0:3:25,22
sugar, here we go.


69
0:3:25,22 --> 0:3:26,0
Listen.


70
0:3:26,0 --> 0:3:26,7
Listen to this sound.


71
0:3:26,7 --> 0:3:29,53
It's Like Rice Krispies.


72
0:3:29,53 --> 0:3:34,35
Super crispy and they're real
juicy, bursting, with juice,


73
0:3:34,35 --> 0:3:35,48
and then that seasoning--


74
0:3:35,48 --> 0:3:38,64
you just smell it, it's crazy.


75
0:3:38,64 --> 0:3:39,89
Hot Star.


76
0:3:39,89 --> 0:3:42,7



77
0:3:42,7 --> 0:3:47,15
So this is a sausage stuffed
with sticky rice.


78
0:3:47,15 --> 0:3:50,26
Sometimes they'll put shiitake
mushrooms, some shallots, and


79
0:3:50,26 --> 0:3:53,62
he's wiping it with a sweet
soy then he just came with


80
0:3:53,62 --> 0:3:55,46
some pickled radish
over there.


81
0:3:55,46 --> 0:3:58,15
Then there's some more pickled
[SPEAKING CHINESE]


82
0:3:58,15 --> 0:3:59,31
that we had earlier today.


83
0:3:59,31 --> 0:3:59,87
[BURP]


84
0:3:59,87 --> 0:4:0,52
Excuse me.


85
0:4:0,52 --> 0:4:4,66
Cucumbers shredded, and then
a Taiwanese red sausage.


86
0:4:4,66 --> 0:4:8,48
Sausage in a sausage.


87
0:4:8,48 --> 0:4:12,13
It's like eating a sausage with
a sticky rice condom on.


88
0:4:12,13 --> 0:4:14,478
And you enjoy it a lot more
than you would think.


89
0:4:14,478 --> 0:4:21,948



90
0:4:21,948 --> 0:4:22,944
EDDIE HUANG: Ice.


91
0:4:22,944 --> 0:4:24,44
GEORGE: Ice.


92
0:4:24,44 --> 0:4:25,49
EDDIE HUANG: Penis ice.


93
0:4:25,49 --> 0:4:26,675
Penis ice.


94
0:4:26,675 --> 0:4:29,733
You like to put it
in your mouth.


95
0:4:29,733 --> 0:4:32,44
[LAUGH]


96
0:4:32,44 --> 0:4:35,41
I'd say top five most popular
Taiwanese night market foods,


97
0:4:35,41 --> 0:4:36,67
this called a
[SPEAKING CHINESE].


98
0:4:36,67 --> 0:4:39,82
They use the funkiness of the
bamboo, the essence of the


99
0:4:39,82 --> 0:4:43,86
pork, some shiitake mushrooms,
some shallots, and they'll


100
0:4:43,86 --> 0:4:47,63
make a ground meat mixture.


101
0:4:47,63 --> 0:4:50,48
In that big mixing bowl
is the starch mixture.


102
0:4:50,48 --> 0:4:51,87
Then they'll put
the filling in.


103
0:4:51,87 --> 0:4:53,4
Once it's filled, it's shaped.


104
0:4:53,4 --> 0:4:57,44
Once it's shaped, it goes here
and steamed, then topped with


105
0:4:57,44 --> 0:4:58,51
the sauce over there.


106
0:4:58,51 --> 0:5:0,65
Sometimes people do a little
sweet chili too.


107
0:5:0,65 --> 0:5:3,28
The thing about Asian food that
always bugs Westerners


108
0:5:3,28 --> 0:5:6,59
out-- savory foods with
a gelatinous texture.


109
0:5:6,59 --> 0:5:9,55
This is probably like the
boogieman food to an American


110
0:5:9,55 --> 0:5:10,58
and Western palate.


111
0:5:10,58 --> 0:5:11,765
But I love this.


112
0:5:11,765 --> 0:5:13,89
And it's the quintessential
Taiwanese flavor.


113
0:5:13,89 --> 0:5:21,45



114
0:5:21,45 --> 0:5:25,2
Yo, mega pause.


115
0:5:25,2 --> 0:5:27,21
Giant waffle dills.


116
0:5:27,21 --> 0:5:28,61
You can give to your friends.


117
0:5:28,61 --> 0:5:30,2
And you can scare
your friends.


118
0:5:30,2 --> 0:5:31,28
And you can take it
to the party.


119
0:5:31,28 --> 0:5:34,22
And you will be the focus of the
party because you brought


120
0:5:34,22 --> 0:5:38,9
a box, a $10 box, of
penis waffles.


121
0:5:38,9 --> 0:5:42,354
What better present to,
like, a baby shower?


122
0:5:42,354 --> 0:5:46,15
Hey ma, what's really good?


123
0:5:46,15 --> 0:5:48,13
We've got the Plaxico
Burress here.


124
0:5:48,13 --> 0:5:50,115
We've got the Dhani Jones.


125
0:5:50,115 --> 0:5:52,3
We've got the Victor Cruz.

We've got the Lawrence Tynes.

Yo, look at shorty here.

0:5:57,8 --> 0:6:1,13
How could you get yourself

0:6:1,13 --> 0:6:3,46
Who volunteers themselves

210
0:9:21,53 --> 0:9:23,45
When we're not here people
probably put their


211
0:9:23,45 --> 0:9:24,59
feet in this shit.


212
0:9:24,59 --> 0:9:26,37
It smells like a hot spring.


213
0:9:26,37 --> 0:9:29,34
I have no idea what's-- this
water is mother fucking green,


214
0:9:29,34 --> 0:9:31,53
and there's no vegetation.


215
0:9:31,53 --> 0:9:34,32
You really, probably, should not
be eating these skrimps.


216
0:9:34,32 --> 0:9:37,63
I feel like this for show and
for sport, but then there's


217
0:9:37,63 --> 0:9:39,61
not much sport to it, either.


218
0:9:39,61 --> 0:9:43,0
And on that note, we
motherfucking out.


219
0:9:43,0 --> 0:9:45,49
Fresh off the Boat with
Eddie Huang, Taiwan.


220
0:9:45,49 --> 0:9:47,822
Peace.


221
0:9:47,822 --> 0:9:50,39
-On the next episode of
Fresh off the Boat.


222
0:9:50,39 --> 0:11:50,39
