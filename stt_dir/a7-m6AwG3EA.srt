0:0:21,34 --> 0:0:26,17
Lightning flickers somewhere in Earth's atmosphere
dozens of times every second. Most of these


2
0:0:26,17 --> 0:0:30,32
electrical flashes remain in the clouds, with
only about a fifth of them reaching low enough


3
0:0:30,32 --> 0:0:35,2
to strike trees, buildings or the ground.
Yet lightning bolts in the clouds deliver


4
0:0:35,2 --> 0:0:39,44
a unique and powerful punch of their own.
They're directly linked to events that produce


5
0:0:39,44 --> 0:0:46,84
some of the highest-energy radiation naturally
found on Earth: terrestrial gamma-ray flashes,


6
0:0:46,84 --> 0:0:48,69
or TGFs for short.


7
0:0:48,69 --> 0:0:53,0
Thanks to recent work by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, scientists have come a few


8
0:0:53,0 --> 0:0:58,4
steps closer to understanding these extraordinary
outbursts. When lightning flashes high in


9
0:0:58,4 --> 0:1:3,36
the clouds, its energy may alter the strong
electric fields near the top of the storm.


10
0:1:3,36 --> 0:1:7,68
About a thousand times each day, this sudden
change triggers an upward surge of high-speed


11
0:1:7,68 --> 0:1:12,41
electrons. Reaching speeds nearly as fast
as light, these accelerated electrons give


12
0:1:12,41 --> 0:1:18,91
off gamma rays when they're deflected by air
molecules. TGFs happen quickly and randomly,


13
0:1:18,91 --> 0:1:21,93
so even catching them by satellite has been
difficult.


14
0:1:21,93 --> 0:1:27,81
But new results from the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
on Fermi are giving scientists fresh insights.


15
0:1:27,81 --> 0:1:33,9
Last year the GBM team showed that TGFs well
away from Fermi produced beams of charged


16
0:1:33,9 --> 0:1:38,11
particles that could travel along Earth's
magnetic field and hit the satellite. Now,


17
0:1:38,11 --> 0:1:42,5
thanks to advancements in data processing,
Fermi's GBM is better at detecting TGFs than


18
0:1:42,5 --> 0:1:47,61
ever before. As a result, scientists have
discovered that radio signals once thought


19
0:1:47,61 --> 0:1:54,88
to be produced by the lightning that triggers
a TGF are in fact broadcast by TGFs themselves.


20
0:1:54,88 --> 0:1:59,24
Each lightning stroke creates a burst of Very
Low Frequency radio waves. Through the World


21
0:1:59,24 --> 0:2:4,39
Wide Lightning Location Network, scientists
use this unique radio signal to track electrical


22
0:2:4,39 --> 0:2:9,119
activity around the globe. For some time,
scientists have know that TGFs were associated


23
0:2:9,119 --> 0:2:13,54
with strong radio signals, so it was natural
to think that these radio signals were produced


24
0:2:13,54 --> 0:2:20,0
by the lightning stroke that triggered the
TGFs.


25
0:2:20,0 --> 0:2:25,36
Here's one instance that highlights why the
GBM team now questions this interpretation.


26
0:2:25,36 --> 0:2:30,87
It's August 2009 and Fermi is flying over
thunderstorms off Mexico's West Coast. Each


27
0:2:30,87 --> 0:2:36,68
symbol marks the location of a lightning The
highlighted circle shows how much of Earth's


28
0:2:36,68 --> 0:2:37,69
surface


29
0:2:37,69 --> 0:2:42,89
Fermi can see at any given moment. Just as
the satellite passes over the storms, a TGF


30
0:2:42,89 --> 0:2:49,189
occurs. There's no other lightning near that
position when Fermi detected the TGF. hundreds


31
0:2:49,189 --> 0:2:53,79
of TGFs and comparing them to radio-based
lightning locations, the GBM team concludes


32
0:2:53,79 --> 0:2:58,719
that both the gamma-ray and the the strong
radio emission comes from the TGF. The team


33
0:2:58,719 --> 0:3:3,23
also finds that weaker radio bursts ocurring
up to several thousandths of a second before


34
0:3:3,23 --> 0:3:9,92
or after a TGF actually represent the individual
lightning stroke associated with it.


35
0:3:9,92 --> 0:3:14,739
The GBM findings confirm a theory published
in 2011 that the same avalanche of speedy


36
0:3:14,739 --> 0:3:22,189
electrons that creates a TGFs gamma rays also
produce strong Very Low Frequency radio signals.


37
0:3:22,189 --> 0:3:26,999
With this knowledge, scientists can pair the
Fermi TGF sample with the more precise radio


38
0:3:26,999 --> 0:3:30,359
positions from the World Wide Lightning Location
Network.


39
0:3:30,359 --> 0:3:35,329
This will clarify weather patterns associated
with TGFs and usher in new studies, perhaps


40
0:3:35,329 --> 0:3:40,14
helping scientists determine which types of
thunderstorms produce some Earth's highest-energy


41
0:3:40,14 --> 0:5:40,14
natural light.
