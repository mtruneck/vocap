###170 [MUSIC PLAYING - THE BLACK LIPS, "LOCK AND KEY"]
###172 
###197 IAN ST. PE: OK, so we're in Israel right now.
###199 And as you can see, it's a lot like New York.
###201 There's a lot of Jewish people, a lot
###204 of kids with guns.
###207 And one better part is instead of swimming in the Hudson
###210 River, we're going to the Sea of Galilee.
###213 Right?
###214 Yes.
###214 [MUSIC PLAYING - THE BLACK LIPS, "LOCK AND KEY"]
###215 
###234 IAN ST. PE: Now, we're in Tiberias, the Sea of Galilee,
###238 and we just found out that there's no beds tonight.
###241 We thought we were going to a kibbutz,
###242 but it's just a porch.
###245 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Oh yeah, did you mention we're--
###246 IAN ST. PE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
###247 We're staying on the fucking porch.
###248 So we have to--
###249 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): We're sleeping on
###249 the god damn ground.
###251 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): How's that for Israeli
###252 hospitality?
###254 IAN ST. PE: It's great.
###255 The hummus today was top notch.
###257 But god damn, they should have told us we're going on a
###261 camping trip with no sleeping bags or tents
###265 or blankets or anything.
###267 JARED SWILLEY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, I'm going to baptize
###268 Cole tomorrow.
###270 He needs it.
###272 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): He does.
###272 JARED SWILLEY (OFFSCREEN): He needs it.
###273 JOE BRADLEY: [INAUDIBLE]
###273 JARED SWILLEY (OFFSCREEN): He needs a cleansing.
###274 He smells so bad right now.
###276 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, there he is.
###277 IAN ST. PE: Hey, Cole.
###278 MALE SPEAKER: Hey, Cole.
###278 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Cole, are you ready to get
###280 baptized tomorrow?
###281 COLE ALEXANDER: Oh, yeah, yeah.
###282 JARED SWILLEY (OFFSCREEN): I'm gonna baptize you.
###282 COLE ALEXANDER: Jared's gonna baptize me?
###283 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): It's time.
###285 COLE ALEXANDER: Comes a time in a man's life.
###286 
###291 MALE SPEAKER: All right.
###292 This is day one.

###329 [MUSIC PLAYING - THE BLACK LIPS, "VENI VIDI VICI"]
###330 
###335 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Can we just talk about that
###337 fucking wooden deck situation for a second?
###339 JARED SWILLEY: Well, we kind of got kidnapped.
###342 I think they were trying to show us a good time.
###344 They said they had a private beach, and I thought a private
###347 beach meant there was a house that goes with it, but I guess
###351 their parents just own a porch.
###355 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): It was dark.
###355 JARED SWILLEY (OFFSCREEN): No lanterns.
###357 Not one pillow.
###358 I think two blankets.
###360 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Two beers.
###361 JARED SWILLEY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, like four
###362 beers between everybody.
###365 It was awesome.
###367 [MUSIC PLAYING - THE BLACK LIPS, "OFF THE BLOCK"]
###368 
###388 COLE ALEXANDER: We are here at the Jordan River, the place
###390 where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist.
###394 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): And what's going to happen to you?
###396 COLE ALEXANDER: I'm gonna have my ass baptized by Jared.
###398 
###402 FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, why not?
###404 
###408 PRIEST: Well, I'm not bequeathed to this area, so I
###411 cannot baptize--
###412 FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): No, it doesn't matter.
###414 PRIEST (OFFSCREEN): [INAUDIBLE]
###415 sacrament.
###416 Yeah.
###417 
###420 FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, I'll pray for you.
###423 [INAUDIBLE]
###426 if you only need a piece of paper.
###428 
###432 JARED SWILLEY: I don't know what to say.
###433 PRIEST: I accept Jesus in the name of the Father, the Son,
###435 and the Holy Spirit.
###436 FEMALE SPEAKER: You're ready.

###448 
###452 Clean?

###454 I'm trying to become baptized.
###456 FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Hurry up.
###457 They always say something.
###458 Hurry up.
###459 Dip yourselves into the water.
###460 Come deeper.
###461 COLE ALEXANDER: Say it loud, into the camera.

###621 COLE ALEXANDER: Hello, we're The Black Lips, and we're at
###623 the Dead Sea.
###623 JARED SWILLEY: We're 400 meters below sea level,
###626 meaning this is the closest place to hell on
###628 earth you can get.
###630 It's good for your skin.
###631 It makes you look good, makes you feel good.
###633 JOE BRADLEY: Smell good.
###634 Make love good.
###636 [MUSIC PLAYING - THE BLACK LIPS, "SEA OF BLASPHEMY"]

###673 
###687 [LAUGHING]
###688 IAN ST. PE: We're making our skin smooth.
###689 COLE ALEXANDER: We're in this medicinal mud--
###691 mud hole with trash and minerals.
###695 JARED SWILLEY: We're smoothing our skin, the Dead Sea '07.
###698 Spring break.

###704 in the 21st century, homeboy.
###706 JOE BRADLEY: [INAUDIBLE].
###707 IAN ST. PE: Peace.
###708 
###717 The stuff on the skin feels like that hot oil stuff that
###721 you put on your girl and she puts on you.
###725 This feels good.
###727 
###739 IAN ST. PE: Do we look relaxed and smooth?
###743 You're god damn right, we do.
###745 This was amazing, amazing.

###829 JARED SWILLEY: Yeah, yeah, straight to the radio.
###831 DAVE HAMNAHEM: And how was it?
###832 JARED SWILLEY: That was incredible.
###834 We floated a lot, and we covered ourselves in mud.
###836 [LAUGHTER]
###839 DAVE HAMNAHEM: Who writes the lyrics for you guys?
###840 COLE ALEXANDER: We all do.
###841 DAVE HAMNAHEM: But for this song specifically?
###843 JARED SWILLEY: Cole.
###843 COLE ALEXANDER: I wrote the lyrics for that song.
###844 I was in Los Angeles, and I was with these people, and
###847 they were smoking crack.
###849 And then this lady was a model, and she was telling me
###851 how her son's teacher had died, and she didn't want have
###854 to tell him because he liked the teacher.
###856 JOE BRADLEY: One, two three, four, five,
###858 six, one, two, three--
###860 [MUSIC PLAYING - THE BLACK LIPS, "HOW DO YOU TELL A CHILD

###984 
###988 With a seven point rating, is that what you said?
###990 MALE SPEAKER: 7%.
###991 COLE ALEXANDER (OFFSCREEN): 7%.

###1010 
###1086 [CHEERING]
###1091 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): What is that smell?
###1092 JOE BRADLEY: What is this bullshit?
###1095 A nigger can't even sing in here.
###1098 Can't see, can't breathe.
###1100 Don't feel good, look good, don't smell good.
###1102 What the fuck is this shit?
###1103 
###1108 I can't see.
###1109 
###1112 Smells like somebody opened up their butthole.
###1114 
###1121 Smells like somebody opened up their asshole in here.
###1123 
###1127 [MUSIC PLAYING - THE BLACK LIPS, "BURIED ALIVE"]
###1128 
###1165 SUROOSH ALVI: What was it like playing at a kibbutz?
###1167 JOE BRADLEY: Well, at a kibbutz-- it's kind of like
###1169 this commune.
###1170 But I think they're all just most just lazy, [INAUDIBLE]
###1172 looking for cheap rent or something like that-- or at
###1174 least that was somewhat of the vibe.
###1176 But it was open every single night until like 11:00.
###1180 They got cheap beer and they don't make any money.
###1182 When we played, they had this tradition.
###1183 They burn this whole frying pan up of pine cones and let
###1187 all the smoke fill that tiny-ass room
###1189 when we were playing.
###1190 The window was right next to me.
###1192 Eyes were closed.
###1193 I could feel the smoke billowing and filling my
###1195 lungs, second and second, losing breath
###1197 and breath and breath.
###1199 And we were like, what the fuck is that?
###1200 It's like, oh, it's our tradition.
###1201 And I was like, well, it's our tradition to breathe.
###1203 [MUSIC PLAYING - THE BLACK LIPS, "BURIED ALIVE"]
###1205 
###1229 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Well, now we're going to the
###1230 other side, so you can--
###1231 COLE ALEXANDER: We're going where no Israeli
###1232 has ever been before.
###1234 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): To play to the Palestinians.
###1235 
###1238 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I'm not nervous at all.
###1239 I think everybody's gonna be really nice.
###1241 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
###1241 Yeah.
###1242 They will be.

###1427 We're here in Bethlehem, in the West Bank.
###1429 Just did a little bit of busking, not for money,
###1432 though, just for fun.
###1433 The kids were into it.
###1434 We got some mint tea from some local shop owners.
###1437 JARED SWILLEY: And now we have bragging rights to say that
###1439 we're the first and only punk band to ever
###1442 play in the West Bank.
