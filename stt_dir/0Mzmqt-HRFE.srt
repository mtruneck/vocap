SHANE SMITH: In Western
mainstream media right now,


4
0:0:27,64 --> 0:0:30,26
we're hearing a lot about
Islamic fundamentalism,


5
0:0:30,26 --> 0:0:33,35
nuclear proliferation,
rogue states.


6
0:0:33,35 --> 0:0:37,402
And public enemy number
one is Iran.


7
0:0:37,402 --> 0:0:39,78
BRET BAIER: The Iranians are
moving forward with their


8
0:0:39,78 --> 0:0:42,66
nuclear program quicker
than expected.


9
0:0:42,66 --> 0:0:45,82
-Iran's President is warning it
is too late to stop Iran's


10
0:0:45,82 --> 0:0:47,4

11
0:0:47,4 --> 0:0:49,24
-Iran basically has a strategy
to dominate the region.


12

DAN GILLERMAN: What I
can tell you is that


13
0:0:51,1 --> 0:0:53,59
Iran must be stopped.


14
0:0:53,59 --> 0:0:55,71
SHANE SMITH: Now, it's
interesting to us that on one


15
0:0:55,71 --> 0:0:58,607
hand you have footage like this
from Fox News saying that


16
0:0:58,607 --> 0:0:59,76
Iran is an imminent threat.


17
0:0:59,76 --> 0:1:1,96
But on the other hand, you have
all these films coming


18
0:1:1,96 --> 0:1:4,4
out where critics are saying,
hey, these are some of the


19
0:1:4,4 --> 0:1:5,33
best films coming
out right now.


20
0:1:5,33 --> 0:1:7,12
They're beautiful, they're
amazing, they're great.


21
0:1:7,12 --> 0:1:9,66
So how is it that we have
on one side an Islamic


22
0:1:9,66 --> 0:1:11,93
fundamentalist state,
but on the other all


23
0:1:11,93 --> 0:1:13,26
these amazing movies?


24
0:1:13,26 --> 0:1:15,66
We had to go to Iran and
find out the truth


25
0:1:15,66 --> 0:1:17,321
behind Iranian cinema.

27
0:1:29,99 --> 0:1:31,89
SHANE SMITH: Now, getting into
Iran as a journalist is nearly


28
0:1:31,89 --> 0:1:32,56
impossible.


29
0:1:32,56 --> 0:1:35,1
They have a very bad reputation
with journalists.


30
0:1:35,1 --> 0:1:37,845
Many have been arrested, a lot
have been tortured, and some


31
0:1:37,845 --> 0:1:38,77
have even been killed.


32
0:1:38,77 --> 0:1:42,13
In fact, there's a World Press
Freedom Index, and Iran is


33
0:1:42,13 --> 0:1:43,48
number 166.


34
0:1:43,48 --> 0:1:46,43
Right at the back of the bus
with only the worst offenders


35
0:1:46,43 --> 0:1:48,96
like Turkmenistan, North
Korea, Eritrea and


36
0:1:48,96 --> 0:1:50,37
Cuba ahead of it.


37
0:1:50,37 --> 0:1:52,64
Now what scared me personally
about going into Iran as a


38
0:1:52,64 --> 0:1:55,24
journalist was that
I knew two things.


39
0:1:55,24 --> 0:1:58,16
One is that Zahra Kazemi, a
Canadian journalist who got


40
0:1:58,16 --> 0:2:0,21
into Iran, was kidnapped,
raped, and


41
0:2:0,21 --> 0:2:2,53
beaten to death in 2003.


42
0:2:2,53 --> 0:2:5,13
And that our friend Ben Anderson
from the BBC, who did


43
0:2:5,13 --> 0:2:7,995
"Holidays in the Axis of Evil,"
went in with a handycam


44
0:2:7,995 --> 0:2:10,82
and was kidnapped and tortured
for a week before they kicked


45
0:2:10,82 --> 0:2:12,54
him out without his tapes.


46
0:2:12,54 --> 0:2:14,67
So we didn't want to go
in with a handycam.


47
0:2:14,67 --> 0:2:17,8
And we didn't want to sneak
in like we usually do.


48
0:2:17,8 --> 0:2:19,18
So we tried for about a year
and a half to get into the


49
0:2:19,18 --> 0:2:20,68
country legitimately.


50
0:2:20,68 --> 0:2:23,68
And finally, the producers of
the Third International Urban


51
0:2:23,68 --> 0:2:27,24
Film Festival got us our visas,
arranged for us to be


52
0:2:27,24 --> 0:2:30,32
able to bring in the cameras,
and did the impossible and got


53
0:2:30,32 --> 0:2:30,88
us into Iran.

Yeah, I know.

SHANE SMITH: I don't know if we
got that do-da-lu on thing,


64
0:2:54,89 --> 0:2:57,69
but if the cops see a camera,
they can turn


65
0:2:57,69 --> 0:3:0,64
their bloopers on.


66
0:3:0,64 --> 0:3:2,45
We're waiting for permission
to shoot outside, so we're


67
0:3:2,45 --> 0:3:4,329
shooting from the car,
which we're not


68
0:3:4,329 --> 0:3:5,688
supposed to do either.

want people shooting?

-With your small camera, you
don't have any problem.


74
0:3:12,405 --> 0:3:14,56
It's just the size of the
camera that makes it


75
0:3:14,56 --> 0:3:15,758
professional as a journalist.


76
0:3:15,758 --> 0:3:18,896
When you have a big camera, you
need to have permission.

-It's better not to do it now.


79
0:3:24,375 --> 0:3:27,54
SHANE SMITH: We were told from
the first day we got there


80
0:3:27,54 --> 0:3:29,98
that we weren't allowed to shoot
anything that didn't


81
0:3:29,98 --> 0:3:31,0
have to do with film.


82
0:3:31,0 --> 0:3:33,27
And they warned us that we could
be arrested if we shot


83
0:3:33,27 --> 0:3:35,75
anything that had to do with
police, military or the


84
0:3:35,75 --> 0:3:37,9
government, which is basically
everything in Iran.


85
0:3:37,9 --> 0:3:40,17
The only places we could really
shoot freely were when


86
0:3:40,17 --> 0:3:42,309
we were indoors, or things that
were directly sponsored


87
0:3:42,309 --> 0:3:46,21
by the Film Festival, and even
then it wasn't easy.


88
0:3:46,21 --> 0:3:49,2
We're about to meet the
coordinator of the Film


89
0:3:49,2 --> 0:3:50,5

0:3:50,5 --> 0:3:55,51
And on the way here, we were
told that we're being watched.

And they talk a lot
about our beards.


92
0:3:58,515 --> 0:4:1,6
They want to know if we got
beards just to come here and


93
0:4:1,6 --> 0:4:3,5
why we're dressed
the way we are.


94
0:4:3,5 --> 0:4:4,42
Why we're so dressed up.


95
0:4:4,42 --> 0:4:7,11
But we were told
to wear suits.


96
0:4:7,11 --> 0:4:11,48
So there's all kinds of
undercurrents that we don't


97
0:4:11,48 --> 0:4:12,11
know anything about.

had a nice office.

SHANE SMITH: Ali Reza
Shoja-Noori was one of the


113
0:4:35,48 --> 0:4:38,95
guys who's responsible for
taking Iranian cinema to all


114
0:4:38,95 --> 0:4:41,385
the film festivals during
the '80s and '90s.


115
0:4:41,385 --> 0:4:44,765
ALI REZA SHOJA-NOORI: For
myself, that I was promoting


116
0:4:44,765 --> 0:4:47,63
the Iranian films abroad.


117
0:4:47,63 --> 0:4:50,17
Then came the big question--


118
0:4:50,17 --> 0:4:52,58
do we have any place
in the world?


119
0:4:52,58 --> 0:4:54,99
Is anyone waiting
for our cinema?


120
0:4:54,99 --> 0:5:0,12
And the first film that we
succeeded was "Frosty Roads."


121
0:5:0,12 --> 0:5:1,936
'86, I think-- '85, '86.


122
0:5:1,936 --> 0:5:4,24
It went to Berlin
Film Festival.


123
0:5:4,24 --> 0:5:10,11
And when I saw the response of
the audience there, I found


124
0:5:10,11 --> 0:5:12,75
out that yes, it's possible
to do that.


125
0:5:12,75 --> 0:5:15,64
And then we went to do other
films and other festivals.


126
0:5:15,64 --> 0:5:19,15
At that time we made one
objective for us that we are


127
0:5:19,15 --> 0:5:23,2
going for a day that there would
be no festival in the


128
0:5:23,2 --> 0:5:25,34
world without an Iranian film.


129

a big culture of


131
0:5:28,87 --> 0:5:30,17
going to the cinema?

0:5:33,75 --> 0:5:37,1
The Iranian people like
films very much.


136
0:5:37,1 --> 0:5:38,6
Very, very much.


137
0:5:38,6 --> 0:5:42,852

children and they like cinema.

SHANE SMITH: The next place
they took us was to Khaneh


140
0:5:48,53 --> 0:5:52,36
Cinema, or "The House of Iranian
Cinema." And there we


141
0:5:52,36 --> 0:5:55,24
walked into kind of a really
surreal situation.


142
0:5:55,24 --> 0:5:57,89
Because even though most
American films are banned in


143
0:5:57,89 --> 0:6:1,54
Iran, they had invited the
American Academy Awards people


144
0:6:1,54 --> 0:6:5,8
over for the first time in 35
years to exchange information


145
0:6:5,8 --> 0:6:6,98
on film and film festivals.


146
0:6:6,98 --> 0:6:9,51
So we walk into the building
and the president of the


147
0:6:9,51 --> 0:6:11,61

is over here.

Oh, there's Annette Bening,
who we had heard in the


149
0:6:13,97 --> 0:6:17,41
Western media before flying
to Iran had been arrested.


150
0:6:17,41 --> 0:6:20,27
And forced to apologize to the
Iranian people for the


151
0:6:20,27 --> 0:6:23,59
Hollywood propaganda of films
like the "300," "The


152

My Daughter."

super weird.

who the hell we are.

crash this lunch.

just shooting around.

were Iranian secret police.
