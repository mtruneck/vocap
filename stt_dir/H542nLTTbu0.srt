1
0:0:7,129 --> 0:0:8,86
Liston: We are
so close to the end.


2
0:0:8,86 --> 0:0:10,209
The deadline for submissions
is approaching very fast.


3
0:0:10,209 --> 0:0:11,61
Tonight at midnight,


4
0:0:11,61 --> 0:0:14,15
YouTube.com will no longer
be accepting entries.


5
0:0:14,15 --> 0:0:16,299
But after eight
amazing years,


6
0:0:16,299 --> 0:0:18,47
it is finally time
to review everything


7
0:0:18,47 --> 0:0:20,599
that has been uploaded
to our site


8
0:0:20,599 --> 0:0:23,7
and begin the process
of selecting a winner.


9
0:0:23,7 --> 0:0:25,14
Kamangar:
We started YouTube in 2005


10
0:0:25,14 --> 0:0:26,71
as a contest
with a simple goal:


11
0:0:26,71 --> 0:0:28,489
to find the best video
in the world.


12
0:0:28,489 --> 0:0:30,56
We had no idea we'd get
such a great response.


13
0:0:30,56 --> 0:0:32,72
You've uploaded over 70 hours
of footage every minute,


14
0:0:32,72 --> 0:0:36,1
and we've been blown away
by the variety, imagination,


15
0:0:36,1 --> 0:0:38,18
and anything goes spirit
that has driven the competition.


16
0:0:38,18 --> 0:0:39,98
Dodson: We are all
storytellers.


17
0:0:39,98 --> 0:0:42,35
That's what pulled me
into this contest.


18
0:0:42,35 --> 0:0:44,47
You know, like,
stories about


19
0:0:44,47 --> 0:0:45,89
how to Photoshop,


20
0:0:45,89 --> 0:0:48,6
and stories about
"The Hobbit" trailer HD.


21
0:0:48,6 --> 0:0:52,51
I encourage everybody to watch
as many videos as possible


22
0:0:52,51 --> 0:0:55,38
before YouTube deletes
everything tonight.


23
0:0:55,38 --> 0:0:57,58
Liston: Every video that
has been uploaded to our site


24
0:0:57,58 --> 0:1:1,4
will be reviewed by our staff
of 30,000 technicians.


25
0:1:1,4 --> 0:1:2,94
They'll narrow down
the submissions,


26
0:1:2,94 --> 0:1:5,86
and then our esteemed panel
will select the best video.


27
0:1:5,86 --> 0:1:8,9
Which will be announced when
the website goes back online


28
0:1:8,9 --> 0:1:13,409
in 2023, featuring the winner
of YouTube and nothing else.


29
0:1:13,409 --> 0:1:16,88
Our team of judges is made up
of distinguished film critics,


30
0:1:16,88 --> 0:1:17,95
YouTube celebrities,


31
0:1:17,95 --> 0:1:19,899
and some of our most
prolific commenters.


32
0:1:19,899 --> 0:1:22,789
Judge: Yes,
it's a product un-boxing.


33
0:1:22,789 --> 0:1:25,469
But I think it adds
to the product un-boxing genre,


34
0:1:25,469 --> 0:1:28,759
and it subverts
our expectations as an audience.


35
0:1:28,759 --> 0:1:32,259
Judge 2: I don't suck, you suck,
and so does this video.


36
0:1:32,259 --> 0:1:33,56
Dodson: Look,
I'm pretty sure


37
0:1:33,56 --> 0:1:36,679
that the first ten minutes
of "Citizen Kane" is great,


38
0:1:36,679 --> 0:1:39,49
but what I love about
"Epic Skateboard Fail"


39
0:1:39,49 --> 0:1:41,59
is that it's short,
it's funny,


40
0:1:41,59 --> 0:1:42,49
and it's straight
to the point.


41
0:1:42,49 --> 0:1:45,2
Andrea: But is it
the best video on YouTube?


42
0:1:45,2 --> 0:1:47,389
Judge: We're going to have
the same conversation


43
0:1:47,389 --> 0:1:51,49
about all 150,000 videos
that we watch.


44
0:1:51,49 --> 0:1:52,539
It's an amazing process.


45
0:1:52,539 --> 0:1:53,85
Kamangar: We always
said that this


46
0:1:53,85 --> 0:1:55,469
shouldn't be
a popularity contest.


47
0:1:55,469 --> 0:1:57,779
"Gangnam Style" has
the same chance of winning


48
0:1:57,779 --> 0:2:0,749
as a video with 40 views of
a man feeding bread to a duck.


49
0:2:0,749 --> 0:2:2,79
KassemG: Of course
I'm hoping to win,


50
0:2:2,79 --> 0:2:5,319
but even if I've inspired
just one person


51
0:2:5,319 --> 0:2:7,579
and harass people
on the beach...


52
0:2:7,579 --> 0:2:9,69
that's something I'll still
feel pretty good about.


53
0:2:9,69 --> 0:2:11,0
Matt Harding: I better win.


54
0:2:11,0 --> 0:2:12,75
Otherwise all those years
traveling the world


55
0:2:12,75 --> 0:2:14,99
were just an expensive
waste of time.


56
0:2:14,99 --> 0:2:18,91
iJustine: My strategy from day one has always
been to upload as many videos as possible.


57
0:2:18,91 --> 0:2:21,42
I mean, it's all about shots on goal.


58
0:2:21,42 --> 0:2:24,41
Rafi Fine: It's important to keep
pushing yourself.


59
0:2:24,41 --> 0:2:28,47
We challenge ourselves every day to think
of groups of people that can react to something


60
0:2:28,47 --> 0:2:32,28
that most people already know about. It's
important that the judges appreciate the risks


61
0:2:32,28 --> 0:2:33,3
that we take as artists.


62
0:2:33,3 --> 0:2:34,87
Harry: When we heard
about the contest,


63
0:2:34,87 --> 0:2:38,11
we spent months trying
to come up with the best idea.


64
0:2:38,11 --> 0:2:38,83
Then Charlie bit my finger.


65
0:2:38,83 --> 0:2:39,7
And I was like,
"Write that down!"


66
0:2:39,7 --> 0:2:41,24
Judson: I did dancing.


67
0:2:41,24 --> 0:2:44,69
David: My dad
put a lot of money


68
0:2:44,69 --> 0:2:46,91
into this dental surgery
I didn't even need


69
0:2:46,91 --> 0:2:49,33
just so we could
win this contest.


70
0:2:49,33 --> 0:2:51,81
He'll be really,
really upset if we lose.


71
0:2:51,81 --> 0:2:53,63
Liston: It's not just
about the recognition


72
0:2:53,63 --> 0:2:55,53
of being
the world's best video.


73
0:2:55,53 --> 0:2:58,61
As promised, when YouTube
started back in 2005,


74
0:2:58,61 --> 0:3:1,37
the winner will also walk away
with an MP3 player


75
0:3:1,37 --> 0:3:2,29
that clips to your sleeve


76
0:3:2,29 --> 0:3:5,59
and a $500 stipend
for your next creative endeavor.


77
0:3:5,59 --> 0:3:8,14
So, remember, get all of your
last-minute submissions


78
0:3:8,14 --> 0:3:10,57
in by tonight at midnight.


79
0:3:10,57 --> 0:3:11,96
While your work's finished,


80
0:3:11,96 --> 0:3:14,0
ours is just beginning.


81
0:3:14,0 --> 0:5:14,0
It's gonna be
an exciting decade.
