###0 bear over there's a guy who said his own abolition trail is one of my best wishes
###2 of all time
###4 they want
###5 they can't find the governor of south carolina
###8 and then he we had a report that he's hiding the appalachian trail but that no
###11 one can reach it
###13 by immediately called bullshit they said there's no way
###16 there's a governor that's inside the united states of america a hiking trail
###20 we can find
###21 date you can find was hidden away
###24 look at it now in hindsight it looks like lockhart of course it was one of
###27 his route
###28 the epidemic at that moment everybody in the nation presently well you know it's
###32 probably argument relevo rabino traveler forum on the trail grammar errors
###37 they have to accept everyday in politician says
###40 at face value
###41 and i don't have to accept that ido bs what i see it
###44 of white separatist covered in bs
###47 so
###47 is this christ when he doesn't resign but of course we found out that he had a
###51 mistress in argentina and those who don the visit but it gets worse
###55 dat used
###56 taxpayer blankets
###57 this time google school career on are
###60 aria first gold as a player in
###62 weinberger frugal and spending taxpayer money wisely
###66 elisa for some using it
###68 the enola played have sex with my mistress
###70 that he had to use it in that case women an eight years earlier he had used
###74 taxpayer funded
###76 plane trips to go outside of his mistress outcome
###79 albrecht that mentioning
###81 grant republics again
###82 you know that this cloud
###85 for impeachment of bill clinton he said what clinton did ngos white that way and
###89 lying about it
###91 web reversible
###92 he should be driven from office he should resign
###96 when he initiates resigned as governor wouldn't take it
###98 what he knew he had an affair he lied about
###102 so now he's back he's are in the first district
###104 is south carolina that is ed deeply conservative district that is to discuss
###109 former district he went to the senate ten scott now the most conservative
###112 under probably in all of the united states senate
###116 so who was uh... severed a runny sbc just won the primary
###119 he wound up being
###121 curtis pasig fifty seven forty three last night so here love you i mean just
###125 elizabeth kolbert abortions of course they would go bears
###129 sister
###130 now she's lady in the polls forty seven forty four to credibly close
###134 but we haven't had the campaign he had
###136 and it is very conservative so it is very likely
###139 now mark sanford
###140 could be back in the united states congress
###143 by the way did republicans seem at rensselaer sanford
###146 you know what he was in congress before he was governor
###148 he said onli firm believer in term limits
###151 three terms than i am out
###153 except for when i come back it
###156 he's going to force beyond the three terms now
###159 he's mark sanford
###161 so uh... he's now of course
###164 brown got so all this is ok
###166 let's hear from
###167 you know one thing that consist of into this campaign is
###170 to acknowledge the fact that that that i feel back in two thousand nine
###174 but there's been a lot of time since it was a great sermon just uh... last
###178 sunday
###179 if the church that i can where he said you know do the events in your life
###182 refined or define your life and i think that political opponents national enough
###186 wanna make any event define your life you know what i think we find whether to
###191 you me or any of us out there will have different events when we wish we could
###195 have done things differently we wish we could handle them better
###198 but in fact they help us to read illsley were finalized makers that much better
###202 person maybe walk out into the the the arena of politics a bit more humble than
###206 we were before yachts also most democrats eliot spitzer anybody we know
###210 you're the well-intentioned dog
###212 you're gonna camera because there's a lot of family values
###215 this guy was on family values
###216 well you know there was a moment where i slipped up you mean the moment where you
###219 repeatedly went to argentina
###221 have sex with your mistress and share your white
###223 acting iran on family values your entire political here
###227 all of those moments
###229 but always with the republican and surrounding the star began in terms of
###232 care
###233 anymore either
###234 so how has this event
###235 changed to as a as a public servant changed you as a menu said
###239 it might make you more empathetic
###243 how would you be a better public servant because of what you went through and
###246 because of of this scandal
###248 i think the do too many people in politics who think that they know it all
###252 uh... and i think that the project this whole image of
###255 of perfection
###257 that the uh... the perfect family move the perfect person the perfect fit
###262 the reality is
###263 none of us are perfect
###265 and i think
###266 the the sooner we recognize their inner cells as a senator who we begin the real
###270 conversations with other people
###272 sentence every cell pastel questions what is the white house correspondent
###276 what the hell is that
###277 how has this made you a better candidate abadaka
###280 officiant
###281 leader of the peril
###283 isn't even better
###284 events in lawrence

###339 god it was at that point okay this is getting uncomfortable but what g_m_
###343 relinquish the god's grace
###346 encino reflected in others

###377 has it all believe in family values either this is an excuse to haiti a
###381 people when you have a guy
###382 who cracked all his family values
###385 destroyed his marriage
###386 less distance behind
###388 what do you say it all in all friend i'm second chances might not have also been
###392 but propaganda logs it year discussion that quiet
###397 he should be embarrassed
###399 anybody want from a south carolina ought to be embarrassed it should be
###402 prohibited from advert measuring family values again or let alone talking about
###408 how their fiscally conservative
###410 cuz you at the warm no such that it
###412 by the way i had that executive director of the staff of the republicans in south
###417 carolina on young turks last night on current television

###424 he won a missionary is again
###425 on on on my watch
###427 and then i'm sure that all amazed event
###429 mark sanford or porkers bostic never polka nominee will will go back to
###433 congress who will go to carve a first-time but there's a live report was
###436 just a value from one of the federal accounting but dot please please again
