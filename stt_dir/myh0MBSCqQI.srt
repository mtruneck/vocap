0:0:5,33 --> 0:0:8,202

3
0:0:8,202 --> 0:0:9,437
Good night.
Good night.


4
0:0:9,437 --> 0:0:11,806
Hey, good night, big man.


5
0:0:11,806 --> 0:0:12,708
Good night.


6
0:0:12,708 --> 0:0:14,376
Good night, mommy.


7
0:0:14,376 --> 0:0:15,711
Ow!


8
0:0:15,711 --> 0:0:17,613
Lindsey, what are you doing?


9
0:0:17,613 --> 0:0:20,115
It's an app for my phone;
It's an ultrasonic ringtone.


10
0:0:20,115 --> 0:0:21,783
A what?
It works like a hearing test.


11
0:0:21,783 --> 0:0:22,917
The younger you are,


12
0:0:22,917 --> 0:0:24,586
the higher pitched sounds
you can hear.


13
0:0:24,586 --> 0:0:25,687
I got one on my phone too.


14
0:0:25,687 --> 0:0:27,355
And why do you need it?


15
0:0:27,355 --> 0:0:29,56
I use it when I go
to people's houses.


16
0:0:29,56 --> 0:0:30,691
It helps find
where the dogs are.


17
0:0:30,691 --> 0:0:31,859
It looks like it works,


18
0:0:31,859 --> 0:0:33,694
'cause there's a dog standing--
ow!


19
0:0:33,694 --> 0:0:34,829
Lindsey, stop it.


20
0:0:34,829 --> 0:0:36,33
I didn't do anything.


21
0:0:36,33 --> 0:0:37,331
Uh, that was me.


22
0:0:37,331 --> 0:0:40,167
Oh.
Let me see.


23
0:0:40,167 --> 0:0:42,37
Wow, that's amazing.


24
0:0:42,37 --> 0:0:43,771
I didn't hear a thing.


25
0:0:43,771 --> 0:0:46,608
Well, Lindsey, just because
I can't hear your phone ring


26
0:0:46,608 --> 0:0:48,61
doesn't mean
I can't hear you talking.


27
0:0:48,61 --> 0:0:49,478
Good night.


28
0:0:49,478 --> 0:0:50,846
Night.
Good night.


29
0:0:50,846 --> 0:0:52,215
Night.


30
0:0:52,215 --> 0:0:54,785
Guys, can I stay up another
half hour on my computer?


31
0:0:54,785 --> 0:0:56,754
You okay?
Yeah.


32
0:0:56,754 --> 0:0:58,22
I've just been having
some weird dreams.


33
0:0:58,22 --> 0:1:0,392
No--
okay, you can stay up...


34
0:1:0,392 --> 0:1:1,993
Another half--


35
0:1:1,993 --> 0:1:4,53
a half hour.
That's it.


36
0:1:4,53 --> 0:1:5,364
Thanks.


37
0:1:5,364 --> 0:1:6,532
Good night.
Night.


38
0:1:6,532 --> 0:1:7,833
Sweetheart, close the door.


39
0:1:7,833 --> 0:1:10,963
Good night.
Thank you.


40
0:1:10,963 --> 0:1:12,697
Finally.


41
0:1:12,697 --> 0:1:15,366
[Yawns] I can't believe
how tired I am.


42
0:1:15,366 --> 0:1:17,935
Are you sleepy,
or are you tired?


43
0:1:17,935 --> 0:1:20,4
'Cause I can work with tired.


44
0:1:20,4 --> 0:1:23,5
Actually, I'm pretty sleepy.


45
0:1:23,5 --> 0:1:25,605
What?
Are you serious?


46
0:1:25,605 --> 0:1:28,506
Look, baby, I know
what you're offering,


47
0:1:28,506 --> 0:1:30,341
and I would love to have it.


48
0:1:30,341 --> 0:1:31,743
But if I don't get some sleep,


49
0:1:31,743 --> 0:1:34,378
one of us might end up feeling
pretty embarrassed.


50
0:1:34,378 --> 0:1:35,513
Really?


51
0:1:35,513 --> 0:1:38,382
You could fall asleep
right in the middle?


52
0:1:38,382 --> 0:1:39,85
I don't want to risk it.


53
0:1:39,85 --> 0:1:42,186
Fine.


54
0:1:42,186 --> 0:1:43,72
Take your tired butt to sleep.


55
0:1:43,72 --> 0:1:45,522
Make sure you get well rested.


56
0:1:45,522 --> 0:1:47,758
Whoa, whoa.
Let me get this straight.


57
0:1:47,758 --> 0:1:49,526
When you don't feel like it,
we don't do it.


58
0:1:49,526 --> 0:1:50,694
But when I don't feel like it--


59
0:1:50,694 --> 0:1:51,728
we should do it anyway.


60
0:1:51,728 --> 0:1:53,697
I'm a man, not a machine.


61
0:1:53,697 --> 0:1:55,699
Oh, trust me;
I know the difference.


62
0:1:55,699 --> 0:1:57,734
What's that supposed to mean?


63
0:1:57,734 --> 0:2:3,172

it's her past.

0:2:43,575 --> 0:2:45,51
Take a look at this.


82
0:2:45,51 --> 0:2:47,646
Can you give me a ruling
on that?


83
0:2:47,646 --> 0:2:48,847
Is that her daughter?


84
0:2:48,847 --> 0:2:50,882
No, that's her.
That's the problem.


85
0:2:50,882 --> 0:2:53,684
I think she's 18,
'cause I met her at jury duty,


86
0:2:53,684 --> 0:2:56,452
but you know how I love
a younger lady.

0:3:3,91 --> 0:3:6,961

I have a situation.


92
0:3:6,961 --> 0:3:8,262
And this stays here.


93
0:3:8,262 --> 0:3:9,997

to anybody--


94
0:3:9,997 --> 0:3:11,765
yeah, yeah, yeah,
"I'll punch you so hard


95

will get knocked out."

0:3:13,867 --> 0:3:15,869
I got it.


97
0:3:15,869 --> 0:3:18,337
I don't like to do it when
the kids are in the house.


98
0:3:18,337 --> 0:3:20,571
I'm afraid they'll hear.
It makes me nervous.


99

with kids before.


100

You just get 'em
good and tired.


102
0:3:25,575 --> 0:3:27,576
You have to treat children
like they're dogs.


103
0:3:27,576 --> 0:3:29,545
What do you want me to do,
put them to sleep?


104
0:3:29,545 --> 0:3:32,28
I was going to suggest
maybe taking them to the park


105
0:3:32,28 --> 0:3:34,49
and throwing a frisbee around.


106
0:3:34,49 --> 0:3:35,75

107
0:3:35,75 --> 0:3:37,285

this girl

to end up on <i>Dateline.</i>


109

her driver's license?


110
0:3:40,721 --> 0:3:42,322
She's from New York;
She doesn't drive.


111
0:3:42,322 --> 0:3:43,889

High School?


112
0:3:43,889 --> 0:3:45,124
She was homeschooled.


113
0:3:45,124 --> 0:3:46,425

114
0:3:46,425 --> 0:3:49,6
Aaliyah, <i>Age Ain't Nothing But a Number.</i>

116
0:3:50,161 --> 0:3:51,396
Damn.


117
0:3:51,396 --> 0:3:54,532
Why don't you just ask
this girl how old she is?


118
0:3:54,532 --> 0:3:55,833
Oh, man,
she could say anything.


119
0:3:55,833 --> 0:3:57,835
Did you look her up
on the Internet?


120
0:3:57,835 --> 0:4:0,537
Mm-hmm, there are 48 Scorpios
in a 200-mile radius,


121
0:4:0,537 --> 0:4:2,739
ages 14 to 69.


122
0:4:2,739 --> 0:4:4,707
A 69-year-old named Scorpio?


123
0:4:4,707 --> 0:4:6,8
Mm-hmm.


124
0:4:6,8 --> 0:4:7,176
That can't be good.


125
0:4:7,176 --> 0:4:9,44
Maybe you should just
cut her loose.


126
0:4:9,44 --> 0:4:10,812
Uh, did you miss the part


127
0:4:10,812 --> 0:4:12,58
where I showed you
how hot she is?


128
0:4:12,58 --> 0:4:19,919
Yup, as hot as a night
in Roman Polanski's jacuzzi.


129
0:4:19,919 --> 0:4:25,158
Okay, a little sexier
this time.


130
0:4:25,158 --> 0:4:27,86
You know, I'm beginning
to worry about you two.


131
0:4:27,86 --> 0:4:28,895
This isn't the first time.


132
0:4:28,895 --> 0:4:29,962
It's not like that.


133
0:4:29,962 --> 0:4:31,3
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.


134
0:4:31,3 --> 0:4:32,31
Did you offer?
Yes.


135
0:4:32,31 --> 0:4:33,65
He said?
"No."


136
0:4:33,65 --> 0:4:34,733
Question.


137
0:4:34,733 --> 0:4:36,701
It doesn't matter
what I was wearing, Gigi.


138
0:4:36,701 --> 0:4:39,304
The man said he was tired.


139
0:4:39,304 --> 0:4:41,373
Well, there's
one or two things.


140
0:4:41,373 --> 0:4:44,674
Either he has diabetes...


141
0:4:44,674 --> 0:4:49,43
Or he has a girlfriend.


142
0:4:49,43 --> 0:4:52,343
Nick is not sick,
and he is not cheating on me.


143
0:4:52,343 --> 0:4:54,11
It has to be something else.


144
0:4:54,11 --> 0:4:55,278
Well, this is a long shot,


145
0:4:55,278 --> 0:4:57,46
but maybe you should just
ask him what's wrong.


146
0:4:57,46 --> 0:4:59,81
I don't like to talk
about my love life like that,


147
0:4:59,81 --> 0:5:0,82
all clinical.


148
0:5:0,82 --> 0:5:1,249
It takes the magic out of it.


149
0:5:1,249 --> 0:5:3,51
Any other suggestions?


150
0:5:3,51 --> 0:5:4,685
Well, if he's too tired
at night,


151
0:5:4,685 --> 0:5:7,253
maybe you should just try him
in the morning.


152
0:5:7,253 --> 0:5:8,958
He can't be tired then;


153
0:5:8,958 --> 0:5:13,596
he just woke up.


154
0:5:13,596 --> 0:5:16,98
Every now and again,
you make sense.


155
0:5:16,98 --> 0:5:20,368
All right, now, pucker up
and say, "Burma's a war zone."


156
0:5:20,368 --> 0:5:23,239
Burma's a war zone!


157
0:5:23,239 --> 0:5:28,396
Nice.


158
0:5:28,396 --> 0:5:31,366
Then we'll come out here.


159
0:5:31,366 --> 0:5:33,433
And why are you making us
go hiking, again?


160
0:5:33,433 --> 0:5:35,435
Your mother needs some time
to herself.


161
0:5:35,435 --> 0:5:36,636
Are you guys fighting?


162
0:5:36,636 --> 0:5:39,205
No, sometimes
if you love someone,


163
0:5:39,205 --> 0:5:40,406
you leave them alone.


164
0:5:40,406 --> 0:5:41,674
You hear that, Lindsey?


165
0:5:41,674 --> 0:5:44,476
If you love me,
you leave me al--ow!


166
0:5:44,476 --> 0:5:45,51
Hey, stop it.


167
0:5:45,51 --> 0:5:46,511

168
0:5:46,511 --> 0:5:48,847

169
0:5:48,847 --> 0:5:49,847
Do not tell your mother.


170
0:5:49,847 --> 0:5:56,152
Kids: Okay.


171
0:5:56,152 --> 0:5:58,54
Hey, man.
What are you doing here?


172
0:5:58,54 --> 0:5:59,388
Oh, nothing.


173
0:5:59,388 --> 0:6:2,424
I just wanted to introduce you
to my friend Scorpio.


174
0:6:2,424 --> 0:6:4,593
It's really nice to meet you.


175
0:6:4,593 --> 0:6:6,194
Martin told me so much
about you.


176
0:6:6,194 --> 0:6:8,695
Mm-hmm.
Hey.


177
0:6:8,695 --> 0:6:10,3
Scorpio.


178
0:6:10,3 --> 0:6:11,898
Such an interesting name.


179
0:6:11,898 --> 0:6:13,133
When's your birthday?


180
0:6:13,133 --> 0:6:14,601
It's June.


181
0:6:14,601 --> 0:6:17,138
Everybody thinks I'm named
after the Zodiac sign,


182
0:6:17,138 --> 0:6:19,54
but really I'm named after
some guy in a group:


183
0:6:19,54 --> 0:6:22,243
The Grandmaster Five
and The Furious Flash.


184
0:6:22,243 --> 0:6:24,478
Grandmaster Flash
and The Furious Five.


185
0:6:24,478 --> 0:6:25,913
Right.


186
0:6:25,913 --> 0:6:28,282
My dad was, like,
their biggest fan.


187
0:6:28,282 --> 0:6:29,583
Oh, boy.


188
0:6:29,583 --> 0:6:31,117
He must be
a little older than me...


189
0:6:31,117 --> 0:6:32,618
Like 40-something?


190
0:6:32,618 --> 0:6:34,19
Actually, I don't know.


191
0:6:34,19 --> 0:6:36,554
My mother refuses to talk
about him now.


192
0:6:36,554 --> 0:6:38,723
He left her for a younger woman
ten years ago.


193
0:6:38,723 --> 0:6:41,191
He's dead to her.
Me too.


194
0:6:41,191 --> 0:6:43,627
Wow.
That must be tough on a kid.


195
0:6:43,627 --> 0:6:46,362
How old were you
when they broke up?


196
0:6:46,362 --> 0:6:47,663
Old enough to know


197
0:6:47,663 --> 0:6:51,533
I will never take
another woman's man.


198
0:6:51,533 --> 0:6:53,735
Well, I don't want
