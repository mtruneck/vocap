>> >>PEGGY: TONIGHT ON KPBS EVENING EDITION,
A HISTORIC VOTE ABOUT SAN DIEGO'S WATER SUPPLY


2
0:0:5,93 --> 0:0:10,83
AT STAKE THE COUNTY'S LONG TERM COMMITMENT
TO BUY MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF DESALINATED


3
0:0:10,83 --> 0:0:14,66
WATER.
AND WRECKING CREWS MOVE INTO HORTON PLAZA


4
0:0:14,66 --> 0:0:19,1
FOR THE START OF A 14ÊMILLION DOLLAR REDEVELOPMENT
PROJECT.


5
0:0:19,1 --> 0:0:23,45
AN ALARMING NUMBER OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE
ABUSED ON THIS SIDE THE BORDER.


6
0:0:23,45 --> 0:0:26,16
WE'LL TAKE AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT REVEALING NEW
RESEARCH.


7
0:0:26,16 --> 0:0:29,41
I'M PEGGY PICO.
DWANE BROWN IS OFF TONIGHT.


8
0:0:29,41 --> 0:1:7,369
KPBS EVENING EDITION STARTS NOW.
CAPTIONS PROVIDED BY ECAPTIONS LATE THIS AFTERNOON


9
0:1:7,369 --> 0:1:11,57
A HISTORIC VOTE CHANGED THE FUTURE OF SAN
DIEGO'S WATER SUPPLY.


10
0:1:11,57 --> 0:1:18,39
THE COUNTY'S 24 WATER AGENCIES VOTED TO APPROVE
A 30 YEAR CONTRACT TO BUY DESALINATED WATER


11
0:1:18,39 --> 0:1:21,95
FROM THE PRIVATE COMPANY PO SIDE N RESOURCE
SES.


12
0:1:21,95 --> 0:1:25,75
KPBS REPORT ALISON ST. JOHN JUST RETURNED
FROM THE MEETING.


13
0:1:25,75 --> 0:1:29,85
TELL US WHY THIS VOTE IS SO IMPORTANT.
>> >>ALISON: SAN DIEGO CURRENTLY DEPENDS ON


14
0:1:29,85 --> 0:1:35,289
IMPORTED WATER AND MAKES IT VULNERABLE TO
BEING CUT OFF IN A DPROWT SITUATION.


15
0:1:35,289 --> 0:1:40,2
THIS AGREEMENT WILL GIVE SAN DIEGO AN INDEPENDENT
SOURCE OF WATER USING OCEAN WALTER THAT'S


16
0:1:40,2 --> 0:1:45,189
BEEN DESALINATED BY THE BIGGEST DESALINATION
PLANT EVER BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT


17
0:1:45,189 --> 0:1:50,149
HERE IN CARLSBAD.
THE PLAN WILL BE BUILT FOR ALMOST A BILLION


18
0:1:50,149 --> 0:1:55,57
DOLLARS AND THE CONTRACTOR AGREED TODAY COMMITS
SAN DIEGO FOR ALMOST 50ÊMILLION GALLONS OF


19
0:1:55,57 --> 0:2:2,59
WATT AR DAY FOR 30 YEARS ONCE THE PLANT IS
BUILD BUILT, WHICH COULD BE BY 2016, BECAUSE


20
0:2:2,59 --> 0:2:7,71
THE COMPANY ALREADY HAS ALL THE PERMITS.
THAT WILL BE ABOUT 10% OF ALL THE WATER SAN


21
0:2:7,71 --> 0:2:11,85
DIEGO NEEDS.
ONE BOARD MEMBER SAYS YOU CAN'T RECYCLE WATER


22
0:2:11,85 --> 0:2:15,44
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT AND THIS WILL CREATE
NEW WATER.


23
0:2:15,44 --> 0:2:21,26
>> >>PEGGY: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR RATE PAYERS?
>> >>ALISON: THE COST IS STILL NOT KNOWN.


24
0:2:21,26 --> 0:2:27,6
THE COST OF SERVICE AGREEMENT IS NOT YET HASHED
OUT AND SOME ESTIMATES ARE 5 TO 7 DOLLARS


25
0:2:27,6 --> 0:2:31,5
TO THE AVERAGE WATER BILL, AND OTHER PEOPLE
SAY IT WILL ADD 10 TO 20 DOLLARS, OA EVEN


26
0:2:31,5 --> 0:2:38,2
MORE FOR BIG WATER USERS.
OPPONENTS OF THE PROJECT POINTED OUT DESALINATION


27
0:2:38,2 --> 0:2:42,12
TAKE AS LOT OF ENERGY AND ENERGY COSTS COULD
SKY ROCKET.


28
0:2:42,12 --> 0:2:44,78
THAT COULD THROW ALL THE CALCULATIONS OUT
OF WACK.


29
0:2:44,78 --> 0:2:49,29
THEY SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SIGN ON TO
WATER RECYCLING FIRST.


30
0:2:49,29 --> 0:2:53,52
THEY POINTED TO DESAL PLANTS IN AUSTRALIA
THAT HAVE HAD TO BE SHUT DOWN BECAUSE THE


31
0:2:53,52 --> 0:3:0,98
COSTS SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL.
SUPPORTS SAY THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN WRITTEN


32
0:3:0,98 --> 0:3:7,0
TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS. THE WATER AGENCIES
AGREED TO START A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS TO


33
0:3:7,0 --> 0:3:14,67
DECIDE HOW TO SHARE THE COSTS.
AS ONE MEMBER PUT IT, NOW THE REAL FIGHT BEGINS.


34
0:3:14,67 --> 0:3:21,37
>> >>PEGGY: TOMORROW THE U.S. SUPREME COURT
WILL KUN SITEDDER IF IT WILL REVIEW A LEGAL


35
0:3:21,37 --> 0:3:25,92
CHALLENGE TO PROPOSITION 8, CALIFORNIA'S BAN
ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE.


36
0:3:25,92 --> 0:3:32,38
SUPPORTER OF THE BAN ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE
ARE APPEALING A LOWER COURT RULING.


37
0:3:32,38 --> 0:3:37,1
IF THE HIGH COURT AGREES TO TAKE ON THE CASE,
ORAL ARGUMENTS COULD BE HEARD AS EARLY AS


38
0:3:37,1 --> 0:3:43,52
NEXT SPRING.
IF THE JUSTICES REJECT THE APPEAL, THE LAST


39
0:3:43,52 --> 0:3:48,64
RULING WILL STAND, MEANING CALIFORNIA'S BAN
ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE WILL NOT BE LEGAL.


40
0:3:48,64 --> 0:3:53,34
THE COURT'S DECISION ON WHETHER TO HEAR THE
CASE IS EXPECTED ON MONDAY.


41
0:3:53,34 --> 0:3:59,7
A SECOND MAN HAS BEEN RESENTENCED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S
NEWLY REFORMED THREE STRIKES LAW, BOTH CASES


42
0:3:59,7 --> 0:4:3,8
WERE HEARD HEAR HERE IN SAN DIEGO.
THERE'S A TWIST IN THIS NEWEST REFORM CASE.


43
0:4:3,8 --> 0:4:8,15
KPBS FRONTERAS REPORTER ERIN SIEGEL IS IN
THE NEWS ROOM WITH MORE.


44
0:4:8,15 --> 0:4:13,25
LAST WEEK KEN KENNETH CORELY WAS RESENTENCED
AND RELEASED FOR CREDIT FOR TIME SERVED.


45
0:4:13,25 --> 0:4:23,72
>> >>: IT'S NOT QUITE SO SIMPLE.
WHEN SERGIO 
WAS CONVICTED BACK IN 1995, HE WASN'T A U.S.


46
0:4:23,72 --> 0:4:26,38
CITIZEN.
HE ONLY HAD LEGAL RESIDENCY.


47
0:4:26,38 --> 0:4:30,259
SO THIS MEANS NOW HE'S GOING TO BE DEPORTED
AFTER HE'S RELEASED FROM PRISON.


48
0:4:30,259 --> 0:4:34,85
>> >>PEGGY: IS THERE A PLAN TO HELP HIM STAY
IN TIJUANA AND OUT OF TROUBLE ONCE HE'S DEPORTED?


49
0:4:34,85 --> 0:4:38,84
>> >>ERIN: CERTAINLY, THERE IS.
HIS LAWYERS TOLD ME THIS MORNING THERE IS


50
0:4:38,84 --> 0:4:44,74
AN EXTENSIVE PLAN IN PLACE FOR HIM.
ONCE HE GETS TO TIJUANA, HE HAS A JOB IN PLACE,


51
0:4:44,74 --> 0:4:49,54
WORKING AS A MECHANIC, HE'S ALSO HAS A BED
RESERVED FOR HIM FOR SIX MONTHS AT A REHAB


52
0:4:49,54 --> 0:4:56,19
FACILITY WHERE HE COULD BE OFFERED BENEFITS
LIKE GROUP THERAPY AND OTHER THINGS.


53
0:4:56,19 --> 0:5:3,47
>> >>PEGGY: SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY CONDUCTED
THE FIRST SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF LABOR TRAFFICKING


54
0:5:3,47 --> 0:5:6,23
IN THE U.S.
THE REPORT INCLUDES INTERVIEWS WITH LOCAL


55
0:5:6,23 --> 0:5:9,98
MIGRANT WORKERS.
THEIR STORIES REVEAL AN ALARMING AMOUNT OF


56
0:5:9,98 --> 0:5:14,96
DANGER, INJUSTICE AND ABUSE.
I SPOKE WITH ONE OF THE STUDY'S RESEARCHERS


57
0:5:14,96 --> 0:5:23,15
ESTELA DE LOS RIOS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF
THE CENTER FOR SOCIAL ADVOCACY.


58
0:5:23,15 --> 0:5:26,36
WHO DID THE RESEARCHERS TALK WITH AND HOW
DID YOU GET THAT INFORMATION?


59
0:5:26,36 --> 0:5:33,59
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: DUE TO OUR RELATIONSHIP
IN THE COMMUNITY, WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH


60
0:5:33,59 --> 0:5:38,29
MIKE RNT WORKERS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE
SAN DIEGO REGION.


61
0:5:38,29 --> 0:5:42,93
NORTH COUNTY, SOUTH COUNTY, EAST COUNTY, IN
RURAL AND REMOTE AREAS.


62
0:5:42,93 --> 0:5:50,85
THEREFORE DR.ÊJANE CONNECTED WITH US TO OUTREACH
TO THESE COMMUNITIES AND GET A RANDOM SAMPLING


63
0:5:50,85 --> 0:5:55,36
OF ALL THE REGIONS.
>> >>PEGGY: YOU TALKED TO ABOUT 826 UNAUTHORIZED


64
0:5:55,36 --> 0:6:1,32
WORKERS, SPANISH SPEAKING.
YOU ALSO OFFERED THEM SOME COMPENSATION FOR


65
0:6:1,32 --> 0:6:2,41
THIS.
TELL US WHY.


66
0:6:2,41 --> 0:6:6,25
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: YES, WE HAD SOME
INCENTIVES FOR THIS BECAUSE QUITE HONESTLY,


67
0:6:6,25 --> 0:6:12,85
THEY ARE LOSING A DAY'S WORK IN A WHOLE DAY.
SO WE HAD A FOCUS GROUP AND ASKED THEM WHAT


68
0:6:12,85 --> 0:6:17,3
WOULD BE FAIR AND APPROPRIATE.
THEY CAME UP WITH 30 DOLLARS A DAY, AND THEN


69
0:6:17,3 --> 0:6:20,35
HAVE THE REFERENCE IF THEY REFERRED SOMEONE
IT WOULD BE 10 DOLLARS EXTRA.


70
0:6:20,35 --> 0:6:23,79
THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE 60 DOLLARS
FOR THAT DAY.


71
0:6:23,79 --> 0:6:25,52
>> >>PEGGY: WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO THE
QUESTIONS.


72
0:6:25,52 --> 0:6:34,8
FIRST, THE STUDY IDENTIFIED WHERE THESE WORKERS
WERE EMPLOYED AND 20% WORKED IN FOOD PROCESSING,


73
0:6:34,8 --> 0:6:42,81
ANOTHER 17% IN CONSTRUCTION, 17% IN JANITORIAL
SERVICES, 10% IN AGRICULTURE, AND 6% IN MANUFACTURING.


74
0:6:42,81 --> 0:6:48,669
I THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED THAT THESE
SORT OF ABUSES OR THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO


75
0:6:48,669 --> 0:6:51,419
THESE IMMIGRANT WORKS DIDN'T HAPPEN OUT IN
THE FIELDS.


76
0:6:51,419 --> 0:6:54,34
TWENTY% WERE IN FOOD PROCESSING.
DID THAT SURPRISE YOU?


77
0:6:54,34 --> 0:6:56,82
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: ABSOLUTELY, THAT'S
CORRECT.


78
0:6:56,82 --> 0:7:2,389
THESE PERCENTAGES REFLECT THE STUDY.
THIS IS WHY IT'S THE HIDDEN POPULATION BECAUSE


79
0:7:2,389 --> 0:7:7,4
YOU WOULD NOT SUSPECT IN RESTAURANTS OR FOOD
PROCESSING, THERE WOULD BE LABOR TRAFFICKING.


80
0:7:7,4 --> 0:7:12,46
>> >>PEGGY: KIND OF IN PLANE SIGHT.
THE STUDY REVEALED NEARLY A THIRD IMMIGRANT


81
0:7:12,46 --> 0:7:18,49
WORKERS, 38,000, I BELIEVE, EXPERIENCE LABOR
TRAFFICKING.


82
0:7:18,49 --> 0:7:21,6
TELL US WHAT LABOR TRAFFICKING IS.
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: THAT'S A VERY GOOD


83
0:7:21,6 --> 0:7:26,54
QUESTION BECAUSE MANY TIMES THE CHALLENGE
IS THESE ARE JUST LABOR ABUSES OR PRACTICES


84
0:7:26,54 --> 0:7:28,81
THEY'RE NOT LABOR TRAFFICKING.
THERE'S A FINE LINE.


85
0:7:28,81 --> 0:7:35,4
WHEN IT BECOMES CORGZ COERCION, THREATS, FEAR
TO LEAVE YOUR WORK OR THREATEN YOUR FAMILY'S


86
0:7:35,4 --> 0:7:39,79
LIFE OR HAVE SOME SEXUAL ABUSE, THEN IT BECOMES
TRAFFICKING.


87
0:7:39,79 --> 0:7:45,229
>> >>PEGGY: THERE WERE REPORTS OF SEXUAL TRAFFICKING
AS WELL, RAPES, ASSAULT, THINGS LIKE THAT.


88
0:7:45,229 --> 0:7:49,15
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: YES, THERE WAS A
LOT OF CRIMES REPORTED FOR AN INSTANCE ONE


89
0:7:49,15 --> 0:7:55,4
THAT RESONATES IN MY MIND CONTINUOUSLY IS
A MOTHER THAT SAW HER DAWRT BEING RAWPED,


90
0:7:55,4 --> 0:8:0,59
SHE WAS 12 YEARS OLD, AND THE 12 YEAR OLD
OBSERVED THE MOTHER BEING RAPED.


91
0:8:0,59 --> 0:8:6,22
WE'RE SPEAKING RAPES, KIDNAPPING, THIS IS
LABOR TRAFFICKING.


92
0:8:6,22 --> 0:8:9,49
>> >>PEGGY: LABOR OR SEXUAL TRAFFICKING.
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: EXACTLY.


93
0:8:9,49 --> 0:8:11,88
>> >>PEGGY: DO THESE IMMIGRANT WORKS REPORT
THIS TO AUTHORITIES?


94
0:8:11,88 --> 0:8:15,729
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: THAT'S THE CHALLENGE.
WE HAVE TRIED TO WORK WITH AUTHORITY AUTHORITIES.


95
0:8:15,729 --> 0:8:23,34
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVE IN OUR
COLLABORATION. THE CHALLENGE IS THIS: THEY


96
0:8:23,34 --> 0:8:28,97
FEAR DEPORTATION, THEY FEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING
TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE INCARCERATED.


97
0:8:28,97 --> 0:8:35,709
WE CONTINUOUSLY LELT THEM KNOW THEY HAVE ROILGTS,
THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR VISA, OPPORTUNITIES


98
0:8:35,709 --> 0:8:38,49
TO SPEAK UP.
BUT THE FEAR FACTOR REMAINS.


99
0:8:38,49 --> 0:8:42,61
>> >>PEGGY: BEING DEPORTED OR WORSE.
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: EXACTLY.


100
0:8:42,61 --> 0:8:47,149
>> >>PEGGY: WHAT WERE SOME OF THE OTHER LABOR
AND SAFETY ISSUES MAYBE NOT AS LARGE AS THAT


101
0:8:47,149 --> 0:8:50,6
BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT.
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: IN CONSTRUCTION,


102
0:8:50,6 --> 0:8:56,259
THEY WOULDN'T GIVE THEM THE HARD HATS, A LOT
OF THEM WORKED WITH CHEMICALS AND WOULD GET


103
0:8:56,259 --> 0:9:0,589
BURNED.
THEY WOULD HAVE A LOT OF HEALTH ISSUES AFTERWARDS


104
0:9:0,589 --> 0:9:9,589
WITH BREATHEING, PESTICIDES, AND ONE WOULD
SAY JUST REPORT THEM TO OCEA, BUTS IT'S HUGE.


105
0:9:9,589 --> 0:9:14,23
BECAUSE YOU GO BACK AND THE EMPLOYER DISAPPEARS.
>> >>PEGGY: AND ALSO I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS


106
0:9:14,23 --> 0:9:17,989
SO NO PAYMENT, IMPROPER EQUIPMENT AS YOU SAID.
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: EXACTLY.


107
0:9:17,989 --> 0:9:24,509
>> >>PEGGY: SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THAT MIGRANT
WORKS PUT THEMSELVES IN THIS VULNERABLE SITUATION,


108
0:9:24,509 --> 0:9:28,449
THEY'RE HERE ILLEGALLY, SO WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE
TO THAT CRITICISM?


109
0:9:28,449 --> 0:9:33,49
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: IN REGARDS TO THE
STATUS WHETHER THEY'RE HERE UNDOCUMENTED OR


110
0:9:33,49 --> 0:9:37,879
DOCUMENTED, THESE ARE CRIMES.
THESE ARE SERIOUS CRIMES WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT.


111
0:9:37,879 --> 0:9:43,79
I BELIEVE THAT CRIME SHOULD BE PROSECUTED.
>> >>PEGGY: WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU HEARD


112
0:9:43,79 --> 0:9:46,999
ABOUT SOME OF THESE HORRIFIC CRIMES LIKE THE
MOTHER/DAUGHTER RAPE.


113
0:9:46,999 --> 0:9:50,6
HOW DID YOU GUYS HELP THE PEOPLE ONCE YOU
FOUND OUT ABOUT THESE?


114
0:9:50,6 --> 0:9:55,72
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: WE FOLLOWED UP AND
OUR ATTEMPT WAS TO TRY TO ASSIST THIS WOMAN


115
0:9:55,72 --> 0:10:1,19
TO REPORT THIS FIRST AND FOREMOST.
BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE, SHE JUST


116
0:10:1,19 --> 0:10:7,139
WANTED TO LET IT GOAVMENT THESE ARE THE EXPERIENCES
WE HAVE ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS.


117
0:10:7,139 --> 0:10:9,199
>> >>PEGGY: BUT YOU DID REACH OUT TO MANY
OF THESE WORKERS.


118
0:10:9,199 --> 0:10:13,689
>> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: YES, WE ALWAYS REACH
OUT TO THEM AND GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITIES


119
0:10:13,689 --> 0:10:17,41
TO ASSIST THEM WITH RESOURCES.
>> >>PEGGY: OKAY.


120
0:10:17,41 --> 0:10:21,379
ESTELA DE LOS RIOS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
TALKING WITH US.

THE TEAM FROM SANFORD BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH

THE STUDY BECAUSE THE GENETIC AND MOLECULAR

OF CONFIDENCE AND THEREFORE PRIVATE INVESTMENT
AND PRIVATE RENEWAL, GAS LAMP DID NOT EXIST.

EXCEEDED MY FONDEST EXPECTATIONS.

0:13:46,579 --> 0:13:49,749
>> >>PEGGY: LET'S TAKE A LOOK THAT ARCHITECT'S
PLANS.


157
0:13:49,749 --> 0:13:53,149
THE FIRST ONE IS SORT OF AN OVERVIEW HERE.
TELL US WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.


158
0:13:53,149 --> 0:13:57,779
>> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE,
THE PHOTO OF THE NEW PARK YOU SEE TOWARDS


159
0:13:57,779 --> 0:14:0,869
THE RIGHT HAND PORTION OF THE PICTURE, THE
CURRENT PARK.


160
0:14:0,869 --> 0:14:5,399
BUT WE AREÊ THAT BUILDING GOES AWAY, WE CREATE
AS I SAID BEFORE AN ACRE AND A HALF OF PUBLIC


161
0:14:5,399 --> 0:14:12,319
OPEN SPACE TO SEE THE NEW TREES, THE AMPHITHEATER
THERE, THE SEATING, RESTROOMS, FOOD PAVILIONS.


162
0:14:12,319 --> 0:14:16,529
>> >>PEGGY: LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT AMPHITHEATER.
WHAT'S THAT GOING TO BE USED FOR.


163
0:14:16,529 --> 0:14:21,279
>> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: THE WHOALD IDEA OF THE
SPACE IS TO ACTIVATE IT, MAKE SURE WE'RE ATTRACTING


164
0:14:21,279 --> 0:14:25,839
PEOPLE DURING THE DAY AND DURING THE NIGHT.
SO WE HAVE ABOUT 200 DAY AS YEAR WE'RE PLANNING


165
0:14:25,839 --> 0:14:31,589
ON PROGRAMS FOR ANYTHING FROM DANCES TO CONCERTS
TO MOVIES ON THE BACK OF THE WALL THERE.


166
0:14:31,589 --> 0:14:34,89
THE IDEA IS LET'S BRING PEOPLE THERE, ACTIVATE
IT.


167
0:14:34,89 --> 0:14:37,639
>> >>PEGGY: I WANT TO GET A SHOT OF THAT MOVIE,
THE RENDITION ARTIST'S RENDITION.


168
0:14:37,639 --> 0:14:40,11
CAN WE SHOW EVERYBODY? LOOK AT THAT GIANT
SCREEN.


169
0:14:40,11 --> 0:14:43,809
>> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: A GREAT SHOT A NIGHT
SHOT, IF YOU WILL, WITH EVERYBODY SITTING


170
0:14:43,809 --> 0:14:48,4
AROUND THE AMPHITHEATER.
THE BUILDING THERE NOW, THAT'S DESIGNED TO


171
0:14:48,4 --> 0:14:53,299
BE A DIGITAL BACKGROUND FOR MOVIES AND SPECIAL
PRESENTATIONS AND OTHERS.


172
0:14:53,299 --> 0:14:57,569
I THINK AS YOU LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITIES THERE,
YOU KNOW, SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE OUT THERE


173
0:14:57,569 --> 0:15:2,149
ON A WARM SAN DIEGO NIGHT, THAT'S THE TYPE
OF GATHERING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.


174
0:15:2,149 --> 0:15:6,35
WORLD CLASS, OPEN PUBLIC SPACE, AND THAT'S
THE OPPORTUNITY.


175
0:15:6,35 --> 0:15:9,489
>> >>PEGGY: LET'S TALK ABOUT DURING THE DAY.
WE SAW THE MOVIES THERE AT NIGHT, BUT THERE


176
0:15:9,489 --> 0:15:13,35
WAS AN ARTIST RENDITION WE'LL PUT UP HERE
FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE, WHERE THERE'S ACTUALLY


177
0:15:13,35 --> 0:15:17,5
TENTS IN THE CENTER OF THIS.
WHAT ARE THOSE FOR?


178
0:15:17,5 --> 0:15:20,709
>> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: THIS IS A GOOD ILLUSTRATION
THAT SHOWS WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE ON A SATURDAY


179
0:15:20,709 --> 0:15:26,17
OR SUNDAY AS WE HAVE VENDORS FOR A FARMER'S
MARKET OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS TO ATTRACT


180
0:15:26,17 --> 0:15:33,17
PEOPLE, TEMPORARY TENTS, DO SOME SHOPPING,
BE OUT DOORS, OUT IN THE SUN SHINE, AND SO


181
0:15:33,17 --> 0:15:36,779
THIS RENDERING RIGHT HERE IS I THINK WHAT
YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE A LOT DURING THE DAY ON


182
0:15:36,779 --> 0:15:39,41
A SATURDAY OR SUNDAY.
>> >>PEGGY: THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT THIS


183
0:15:39,41 --> 0:15:43,249
OPEN SPACE YOU TOUCHED ON.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LAST ARTISTS PICTURE


184
0:15:43,249 --> 0:15:46,259
HERE.
YOU CAN SEE YOU WERE TELL ME YOU CAN SEE THROUGH


185
0:15:46,259 --> 0:15:51,16
NOW THE AREA ALL THE WAY BACK TO TELL US WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING AT SO WE CAN SEE.


186
0:15:51,16 --> 0:15:53,819
>> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE
RENDERINGS.


187
0:15:53,819 --> 0:16:0,109
YOU LOOK ON BROADWAY LOOKING BACK, THE BUILDING
IS GONE, AND WE CREATE AD REMARKABLE VISTA


188
0:16:0,109 --> 0:16:4,35
VIEW TO THE HITS HISTORIC BALBOA THEATER YOU'RE
SEEING IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE SHOT.


189
0:16:4,35 --> 0:16:8,499
LOOKING THROUGH THE COLUMNS, YOU SAW THEM
LIT UP AT NIGHT.


190
0:16:8,499 --> 0:16:12,899
THIS IS GOING TO BE A WHOLE NEW FRONT PORCH
FOR DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO, AND AS YOU CAN SEE


191
0:16:12,899 --> 0:16:17,869
BY THE AMPHITHEATER SHOT THERE, AND ALL OF
THE TREES, IT'S GOING TO BE A PLACE OF GATHERING


192
0:16:17,869 --> 0:16:22,589
PLACE FOR FAMILIES, FOR OTHER FOLKS, AND WE
WERE OUT THERE TALKING TODAY AT THE GROUND


193
0:16:22,589 --> 0:16:25,899
PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THIS WOULD BE
A GREAT PLACE TO HAVE NEW DWREER'S EVE CELEBRATIONS.


194
0:16:25,899 --> 0:16:33,739
>> >>PEGGY: THE EXCITEMENT OF IT.
THE CITY ACQUIRED THIS STORE PROPERTY, I THINK


195
0:16:33,739 --> 0:16:37,85
IT WAS ROBINSON MAY MAY THEN HOLLYWOOD PLANET.
>> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: PLANET HOLLYWOOD.


196
0:16:37,85 --> 0:16:41,899
>> >>PEGGY: BUT THEY DID IT IN A CREATIVE
WAY.


197
0:16:41,899 --> 0:16:44,549
WHAT WAS THAT ARRANGEMENT?
>> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: GRIET GREAT PRIVATE


198
0:16:44,549 --> 0:16:49,85
PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WESTFIELD CORPORATION.
THEY WERE LOOKING TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AND


199
0:16:49,85 --> 0:16:54,819
THE CITY HAS BEEN LOOKING TO PROVIDE MORE
OPEN SPARK SPACES AND PUBLIC PARK PARKS. THIS


200
0:16:54,819 --> 0:17:1,999
CAME FROM FINANCING FROM WESTFIELD, REDEVELOPMENT
AGENCY, NOW CIVIC SAN DIEGO, A GREAT PARTNERSHIP


201
0:17:1,999 --> 0:17:6,12
WITH THE IDEA HOW CAN WE GET THIS DONE AND
COMPLETED.


202
0:17:6,12 --> 0:17:10,52
TOOK ABOUT TWO YEARS.
AND SO TODAY WAS A PRETTY BIG MILESTONE.


203
0:17:10,52 --> 0:17:14,569
>> >>PEGGY: WILL THIS GENERATE ANY FUNDS FOR
THE CITY?


204
0:17:14,569 --> 0:17:16,889
>> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: IT WON'T GENERATE MUCH
FUNDS.


205
0:17:16,889 --> 0:17:21,829
WE'LL IS HAVE SOME SALES TAX FROM SOME OF
THE VENDORS, BUT THIS IS ABOUT PROVIDING AN


206
0:17:21,829 --> 0:17:26,309
AMENITY, PROVIDING THE GATHERING SPACE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER CITIES WHETHER IT'S


207
0:17:26,309 --> 0:17:30,889
ACROSS THE COUNTRY OR ACROSS THE WORLD, ONE
OF THE HALLMARKS OF A GREAT URBAN SPACE IS


208
0:17:30,889 --> 0:17:35,9
TO HAVE GAISÊ GREAT URBAN CITY IS TO HAVE
THESE GREAT PUBLIC OPEN GATHERING SPACES.


209
0:17:35,9 --> 0:17:38,92
WE DON'T QUITE HAVE THAT IN DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO,
BUT WE'RE GOING TO NOW.


210
0:17:38,92 --> 0:17:41,529
>> >>PEGGY: WHAT WILL WESTFIELD GET OUT OF
IT?


211
0:17:41,529 --> 0:17:47,39
>> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: THEY WANTED TO MAKE
HORTON PLAZA MORE INVITING, MORE ATTRACTIVE.


212
0:17:47,39 --> 0:17:52,19
REMEMBER WHEN HORTON PLAZA WAS DEVELOPED,
DOWNTOWN WAS A VASTLY DIFFERENT PLACE.


213
0:17:52,19 --> 0:17:57,639
IT WASN'T THE SAFEST PLACE TO BE, THE SHOPPING
CENTER WAS DESIGNED INWARD, NOT OUTWARD, THEY'RE


214
0:17:57,639 --> 0:18:1,929
GOING TO BE LOOKING TO MAKE SOME MAJOR CHANGES
IN THE FUTURE TO HELP OPEN THAT UP.


215
0:18:1,929 --> 0:18:5,38
THIS IS A BIG PART OF DOING THAT, TO MAKE
IT MORE INVITING FOR PEOPLE TO COME DOWN AND


216
0:18:5,38 --> 0:18:10,429
ENJOY IT.
>> >>PEGGY: HOW MUCH IS IT EXPECTED TO COST.


217
0:18:10,429 --> 0:18:13,83
>> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: $14ÊMILLION CONSTRUCTION,
GOING TO BE STARTING, AND WE TOLD FOLKS TODAY


218
0:18:13,83 --> 0:18:21,309
LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THIS IN SPRING OF 2014.
>> >>PEGGY: CITY COUNCIL MEMBER KEVIN FAULCONER.


219
0:18:21,309 --> 0:18:26,849
YOU CAN TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE PLANS FOR
HORTON PLAZA PARK ON OUR WEBSITE KPBS.ORG.


220
0:18:26,849 --> 0:18:32,62
>> >>PEGGY: NO CHARGERS WILL BE SEEN ON LOCAL
TV THIS WEEKEND FOR THE THIRD TIME THIS SEASON.


221
0:18:32,62 --> 0:18:37,47
THE TEAM DID NOT SELL ENOUGH TICKETS TO AVOID
AN NFL MANDATED TV BLACKOUT.


222
0:18:37,47 --> 0:18:42,76
THERE ARE STILL 11,000 TICKETS AVAILABLE FOR
SUNDAY'S GAME.


223
0:18:42,76 --> 0:18:47,35
RIGHT NOW, THE CHARGERS RECORD IS FOUR WINS,
AND SEVEN LOSSES.


224
0:18:47,35 --> 0:18:53,769
AND THE BENGALS ARE FAVORED TO WIN THIS WEEKEND.
TWINKIES MAY BE BACK IN LUNCH BOXES SOON.


225
0:18:53,769 --> 0:18:58,72
HOST ESES, THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE SWEET
TREATS SAY THEY'VE GOT MORE THAN 100 POTENTIAL


226
0:18:58,72 --> 0:19:4,639
BUYERS FOR ITS PRODUCT LINE AS IT LIQUIDATES.
MEAN WHILE, THE COMPANY IS SEEKING COURT APPROVAL


227
0:19:4,639 --> 0:19:10,409
OF NEARLY $2ÊMILLION IN BONUSES FOR ITS TOP
EXECUTIVES AS IT SHUTS DOWN.


228
0:19:10,409 --> 0:19:15,169
HOST ES DECLARED BANKRUPTCY FOR THE SECOND
TIME AFTER ITS BAKERS UNION WENT ON STRIKE


229
0:19:15,169 --> 0:19:22,74
EARLIER THIS MONTH. THE UNION WANTS AN INDEPENDENT
TRUSTEE TO OVER SEE THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDATION.


230
0:19:22,74 --> 0:19:27,95
AND TOMORROW MARKS THE END OF THE LINE FOR
A HISTORIC OYSTER FARM ON THE COAST OF NORTHERN


231
0:19:27,95 --> 0:19:30,529
CALIFORNIA.
THE DRAKE BAY OWES OYSTER COMPANY HAS BEEN


232
0:19:30,529 --> 0:19:38,299
IN COMPANY FOR A HUNDRED YEARS.
IT HAS 30 EMPLOYEES, BUT TODAY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT


233
0:19:38,299 --> 0:19:42,59
OF THE INTERIOR SAID IT WOULD NOT RENEW THE
COMPANY'S LEASE.


234
0:19:42,59 --> 0:19:46,809
ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THE OYSTER FARM THREATENED
WILD LIFE.


235
0:19:46,809 --> 0:19:52,799
THE LAND WILL BE RETURNED TO MOTHER NATURE
AS A WILDERNESS SITE.


236
0:19:52,799 --> 0:19:58,1
A HIGH SURF ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON.


237
0:19:58,1 --> 0:20:1,11
STORMS IN THE PACIFIC ARE CAUSING THE HEAVY
SURF.


238
0:20:1,11 --> 0:20:5,679
WAVES REACHED ABOUT 7ÊFEET IN OCEAN BEACH
EARLIER TODAY, AND ARE EXPECTED TO GET EVEN


239
0:20:5,679 --> 0:20:10,6
HIGHER WITH PREDICTIONS UP TO 14ÊFEET ACCORDING
TO SURF LINE.COM.


240
0:20:10,6 --> 0:20:16,11
ALONG WITH THE HIGH SURF, THE NATIONAL WEATHER
SERVICE SAYS WE CAN EXPECT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS


241
0:20:16,11 --> 0:20:42,24
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
HERE'S A LOOK AT THE FORECAST.


242
0:20:42,24 --> 0:20:46,7
EARLIER IN THIS NEWS CAST WE TALKED ABOUT
THE FUTURE OF SAN DIEGO'S WATER SUPPLY WITH


243
0:20:46,7 --> 0:20:51,7
THE APPROVAL OF A CONTRACT TO BUY MILLIONS
OF GALLONS OF DESALINATED WATER.


244
0:20:51,7 --> 0:20:56,6
THAT'S THE FUTURE BUT KEN KRAMER TAKES US
BACK TO SAN DIEGO'S WATER PAST.


245
0:20:56,6 --> 0:21:1,88
>> >>: HERE IT IS, JUST A FEW PARTS OF IT
REMAINING, ABOUT ALL THERE IS LEFT TO SEE


246
0:21:1,88 --> 0:21:10,929
IN FACT OF WHAT WAS ONCE THIS.
ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING STRUCTURES EVER BUILT


247
0:21:10,929 --> 0:21:18,419
IN SAN DIEGO MADE OF 9ÊMILLION BOARD FEET
OF RED WOOD IT WAS A 33 MILE LONG OPEN TRAIL


248
0:21:18,419 --> 0:21:21,75
FLOWING WATER.
I THINK YOU HAD TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT, BUT


249
0:21:21,75 --> 0:21:26,299
AT LEAST THERE ARE PICTURES.
SEE, IT USED TO BE IN SAN DIEGO THAT MOST


250
0:21:26,299 --> 0:21:31,509
OF THE WATER WE DRANK AND USED FOR IRRIGATION
CAME FROM WELLS AND IT WAS SALTY, SOMETIMES


251
0:21:31,509 --> 0:21:38,13
NAUSEATING, NOT GOOD WATER, REALLY.
BUT IN 1889, THIS BLOOM CHANGED EVERYTHING


252
0:21:38,13 --> 0:21:43,309
AND IT WAS JUST AN ENORMOUS PROJECT TO BRING
GOOD N WATER FROM THE MOUNTAINS FROM THE EASTERN


253
0:21:43,309 --> 0:21:49,269
PART OF LA MESA AND ON TO SAN DIEGO.
THERE HAD TO BE A DAM BUILT WAY UP ON THE


254
0:21:49,269 --> 0:21:53,289
SAN DIEGO RIVER AT BOULDER CREAK.
THAT'S WHERE THE WATER WAS CAPTURED TO BE


255
0:21:53,289 --> 0:22:0,84
PUT IN THE FLUM.
IT WAS SIX FEET WIDE, 18 INCHES DEEP, FULL


256
0:22:0,84 --> 0:22:5,539
OF WATER, RUNNING ALL THOSE MILES, AND IT
HAS H TO BE ALL DOWN HILL OF COURSE SO THE


257
0:22:5,539 --> 0:22:10,269
WATER WOULD KEEP FLOWING.
THERE WERE TUNNELS, HERE'S THE LOS COCHES


258
0:22:10,269 --> 0:22:22,94
TUNNEL, AND MORE THAN 300TRESSELS, 1,000Ê
65ÊFEET HIGH, NOBODY HAD EVER SEEN ANYTHING


259
0:22:22,94 --> 0:22:27,889
LIKE THAT IN SAN DIEGO.
SO AMAZING WAS THIS THING THAT ON OPENING


260
0:22:27,889 --> 0:22:35,29
DAY, 22ND OF FEBRUARY, 1889, PUBLIC OFFICIALS
AND DIGNITARIES TOOK A RIDE ON WOODEN BOATS


261
0:22:35,29 --> 0:22:40,37
DOWN A GOOD PART OF THE FLUME.
THAT'S THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA, WHOSE NAME


262
0:22:40,37 --> 0:22:46,47
INTERESTINGLY WAS ROBERT W.WATERMAN.
THE FLUME WAS BUILT AND HAD TO BE MAINTAINED.


263
0:22:46,47 --> 0:22:53,62
IT WAS WOOD, AND SOMETIMES LEAKED.
SO YOU HAD FLUME WALKERS WHO SAW TROUBLE SPOTS,


264
0:22:53,62 --> 0:23:0,97
AND MADE REPAIRS, INSPECTORS, AND HOUSES BUILT
ALONG THE ROUTE SO THOSE WORKERS AND THEIR


265
0:23:0,97 --> 0:23:5,649
FAMILIES HAD A PLACE TO LIVE.
LOOKING BACK THERE WERE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH


266
0:23:5,649 --> 0:23:8,57
THE SAN DIEGO FLUME.
FOR ONE THING, IN THE HOT SUMMER MONTHS ALL


267
0:23:8,57 --> 0:23:15,389
THAT WATER IN A SHALLOW CONTAINER MOVING ALONG,
TOO MUCH OF THAT WATER EVAPORATED.


268
0:23:15,389 --> 0:23:23,19
IN 1919 A WIND TUNNEL BLEW OVER THE SWEET
WATER TRESSEL.


269
0:23:23,19 --> 0:23:26,1
IN ITS TIME AND FOR ITS PURPOSE, IT DID ITS
JOB.


270
0:23:26,1 --> 0:23:31,9
THE WATER EVENTUALLY ENDING UP IN LA MESA
RESERVOIR PIPED FROM THERE INTO SAN DIEGO.


271
0:23:31,9 --> 0:23:36,44
LA MESA RESERVOIR WHICH WOULD LATER BE BUILT
UP INTO WHAT WOULD BECOME LAKE MURRAY.


272
0:23:36,44 --> 0:23:41,44
AND SOME OF THE WATER TOO WENT TO A RANCHER'S
POND, SOMETIMES KNOWN AS DUCK POND.


273
0:23:41,44 --> 0:23:45,74
IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO ANTHONY'S FISH GROTTO,
YOU KNOW THE DUCK POND IS STILL THERE, EVEN


274
0:23:45,74 --> 0:23:50,34
THOUGH THE FLUME IS GONE.
IT JUST DIDN'T AGE WELL.


275
0:23:50,34 --> 0:23:55,519
BY THE LATE 1920S, CUSTOMERS WERE DEMANDING
REPAIRS AND THE STATE OF THE ART WATER DELIVERY


276
0:23:55,519 --> 0:24:1,7
AND STORAGE HAD CHANGED.
IN TIME DAMS WERE BUILT, THE LOWER OTAY, AND


277
0:24:1,7 --> 0:24:7,149
MORENA, AND PIPES CYPHENS, AND CONCRETE TUNNELS
REPLACED THE FLUME.


278
0:24:7,149 --> 0:24:12,59
BUT WHAT A THING IT WAS.
HERE'S OLD HIGHWAY 80 AND THE FLUME, NOW THE


279
0:24:12,59 --> 0:24:19,11
LAKE JENNINGS PARK ROAD OFF RAMP, WHERE JUST
UP THE ROAD AT THE LEAVY WATER TREATMENT PLANT,


280
0:24:19,11 --> 0:24:24,909
THE HELIX WATER DISTRICT HAS KEPT A FEW BITS
OF THE FLUME VISITORS CAN SEE, AN OLD WAGON


281
0:24:24,909 --> 0:24:33,629
THAT ROLLED DOWN THE FLUME DURING THE CONSTRUCTION,
AND THEN A SECTION, JUST A SECTION OF WHAT


282
0:24:33,629 --> 0:24:40,59
WAS ONCE AN ENGINEERING MARVEL THAT DELIVERED
GOOD, IT SWEET WATER FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND


283
0:24:40,59 --> 0:24:46,68
BECAME A REMARKABLE PART OF HISTORY ABOUT
SAN DIEGO.


284
0:24:46,68 --> 0:24:54,559
>> >>PEGGY: YOU CAN SEE MORE OF KEN KRAMER'S

COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY APPROVED A 30 YEAR
DEAL TO BUY DESALINATED WATER FROM A PLANT


287
0:25:6,22 --> 0:25:9,389
IN CARLSBAD.
THE POSEIDON PLANT WILL BE THE LARGEST OF


288
0:25:9,389 --> 0:25:14,94
ITS KIND IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.
CONVERTING SEA WATER WILL GIVE US A MORE RELIABLE


289
0:25:14,94 --> 0:25:20,83
SUPPLY. THE COST TO RATE PAYERS STILL ISN'T
WORKED OUT.


290
0:25:20,83 --> 0:25:26,9
AND DEMOLITION IS UNDERWAY AT HORTON PLAZA,
THE OLD ROBINSON MAY BUILDING IS BEING TORN
