0:0:3,4 --> 0:0:7,32
Shaheen's here with his single mum, Karen,
who's also his biggest fan.


2
0:0:7,32 --> 0:0:10,4
They both hope that the song he's prepared
will blow the judges away.


3
0:0:10,4 --> 0:0:15,4
Well, I'm singing 'Valerie' today,
by Amy Winehouse, and I'm just singing it
because it's one of my favourite
songs to sing.


4
0:0:15,4 --> 0:0:15,41
I sing it in different family occasions


5
0:0:15,41 --> 0:0:20,76
I sing it in different family occasions
for, like, weddings and parties
and different things.


6
0:0:20,76 --> 0:0:24,12
And my granddad really loves this song
so, whenever I sing it, it makes him happy.


7
0:0:24,12 --> 0:0:25,74
So it's a big day for you, today.


8
0:0:25,74 --> 0:0:26,0
Yep.


9
0:0:26,0 --> 0:0:27,2
This could be the big break.


10
0:0:27,2 --> 0:0:28,28
Exactly.


11
0:0:28,28 --> 0:0:30,23
The first day of the rest of your life.


12
0:0:30,23 --> 0:0:31,43
Dec: Is this mum?
Karen: That's me.
Ant: Look at that face, he's not worried.


13
0:0:31,43 --> 0:0:31,474
Dec: Hiya, mum. You alright?
Karen: That's me.
Ant: Look at that face, he's not worried.


14
0:0:31,474 --> 0:0:32,474
Dec: Hiya, mum. You alright?
Karen: Yeah, fine.
Ant: Look at that face, he's not worried.


15
0:0:32,474 --> 0:0:33,454
Dec: Hiya, mum. You alright?
Karen: Yeah, fine.
Ant: He's not worried.


16
0:0:33,454 --> 0:0:33,463
Dec: Hiya, mum. You alright?
Ant: He's not worried.


17
0:0:33,463 --> 0:0:34,8
Ant: He's not worried.


18
0:0:34,8 --> 0:0:41,24
So, let's see if this little boy can make
his and his mum's dreams come true.


19
0:0:41,24 --> 0:0:42,12
Hello


20
0:0:42,12 --> 0:0:43,88
My name's Shaheen Jafargholi.


21
0:0:43,88 --> 0:0:45,48
OK, what're you gonna sing?


22
0:0:45,48 --> 0:0:47,48
I'm gonna sing 'Valerie' by Amy Winehouse.


23
0:0:47,48 --> 0:0:51,16
Are you?


24
0:0:51,16 --> 0:0:56,8
OK, good luck.


25
0:0:56,8 --> 0:1:27,64
#  'Valerie' as performed by Amy Winehouse  #


26
0:1:27,64 --> 0:1:32,92
You got this really wrong.


27
0:1:32,92 --> 0:1:38,76
What do you sing apart from that?


28
0:1:38,76 --> 0:1:40,92
'Who's Loving You' by Michael Jackson.


29
0:1:40,92 --> 0:1:43,28
You wanna give that a go?


30
0:1:43,28 --> 0:1:47,36
OK


31
0:1:47,36 --> 0:2:4,16
#  'Who's Loving You'  #
#  as performed by Michael Jackson  #


32
0:2:4,16 --> 0:2:5,16
Dec: Wow.
#  'Who's Loving You'  #
#  as performed by Michael Jackson  #


33
0:2:5,16 --> 0:2:24,44
#  'Who's Loving You'  #
#  as performed by Michael Jackson  #


34
0:2:24,44 --> 0:2:26,2
Look at Simon. [inaudible]
#  'Who's Loving You'  #
#  as performed by Michael Jackson  #


35
0:2:26,2 --> 0:3:5,64
#  'Who's Loving You'  #
#  as performed by Michael Jackson  #


36
0:3:5,64 --> 0:3:7,2
That is amazing.
#  'Who's Loving You'  #
#  as performed by Michael Jackson  #


37
0:3:7,2 --> 0:3:44,84
#  'Who's Loving You'  #
#  as performed by Michael Jackson  #


38
0:3:44,84 --> 0:3:45,595
Wow!


39
0:3:45,595 --> 0:3:46,835
OK,


40
0:3:46,835 --> 0:3:47,677
Simon.


41
0:3:47,677 --> 0:3:55,12
Er, this is how one song can change your life.


42
0:3:55,12 --> 0:3:56,76
And this may be


43
0:3:56,76 --> 0:4:0,6
the start of something special for you,
young man.


44
0:4:0,6 --> 0:4:5,96
Really.


45
0:4:5,96 --> 0:4:6,76
Piers


46
0:4:6,76 --> 0:4:7,604
Shaheen.


47
0:4:7,604 --> 0:4:11,64
Well, you have just shown
that Wales has got talent.


48
0:4:11,64 --> 0:4:16,84
Thank you.


49
0:4:16,84 --> 0:4:16,843
Doesn't happen to me very often,


50
0:4:16,843 --> 0:4:19,76
Doesn't happen to me very often,
but I get... I do the goosebump test.


51
0:4:19,76 --> 0:4:21,479
I got it with Paul Potts,


52
0:4:21,479 --> 0:4:23,56
I got it with George Sampson,


53
0:4:23,56 --> 0:4:31,2
and I got it with you.


54
0:4:31,2 --> 0:4:35,0
Piers, yes or no?


55
0:4:35,0 --> 0:4:41,0
It's a definite 'yes' from me, Shaheen.


56
0:4:41,0 --> 0:4:42,56
Oh, it's a no-brainer.


57
0:4:42,56 --> 0:4:43,36
Yes!


58
0:4:43,36 --> 0:4:45,41
Thank you.


59
0:4:45,41 --> 0:4:46,12
Shaking


60
0:4:46,12 --> 0:4:48,52
I know, I'm shaking, I'm really nervous.


61
0:4:48,52 --> 0:4:54,76
Shaheen,


62
0:4:54,76 --> 0:4:56,88
you just got three very large yesses.


63
0:4:56,88 --> 0:5:15,44
Thank you!


64
0:5:15,44 --> 0:5:16,8
Love him...


65
0:5:16,8 --> 0:5:17,96
love him!


66
0:5:17,96 --> 0:5:18,64
Well done!


67
0:5:18,64 --> 0:5:19,4
Thank you.


68
0:5:19,4 --> 0:5:20,982
Well done, that was amazing.


69
0:5:20,982 --> 0:5:23,632
That's a really hard song to sing, that.
I mean really hard.


70
0:5:23,632 --> 0:5:27,165
What did it feel like at the end, there?
Everybody stood up,
the three judges were on their feet.


71
0:5:27,165 --> 0:5:29,32
It was (just) amazing.


72
0:5:29,32 --> 0:5:31,399
I never knew I could make somebody do that.


73
0:5:31,399 --> 0:5:34,36
It's just... ah. Can't describe it â€“
words can't describe it.


74
0:5:34,36 --> 0:7:34,36
It was really good.
