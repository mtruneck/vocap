1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:12,63
[MUSIC]


2
0:0:12,63 --> 0:0:13,63
BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah.


3
0:0:13,63 --> 0:0:15,56
This pretty much has
been my playground


4
0:0:15,56 --> 0:0:20,11
for the past 15 years.


5
0:0:20,11 --> 0:0:26,51
I started renting snowmobiles
down the road and looking for


6
0:0:26,51 --> 0:0:28,641
rideable terrain.


7
0:0:28,641 --> 0:0:30,53
SHANE GRIMES: So do you think
you were some of the first


8
0:0:30,53 --> 0:0:31,879
snowboarders out here?


9
0:0:31,879 --> 0:0:34,14
BRYAN IGUCHI: Pretty
much, yeah.


10
0:0:34,14 --> 0:0:35,64
To snowboard in this area?


11
0:0:35,64 --> 0:0:36,615
For sure.


12
0:0:36,615 --> 0:0:39,57
WILLIE MCMILLON: Growing up here
in the back country, we


13
0:0:39,57 --> 0:0:43,57
probably rode for seven, eight
years without a transceiver,


14
0:0:43,57 --> 0:0:48,21
without a probe,
even backpacks.


15
0:0:48,21 --> 0:0:51,7
We just carried our board way
out in the middle of--


16
0:0:51,7 --> 0:0:52,89
I mean, we had no idea
what we were doing.


17
0:0:52,89 --> 0:0:56,4
I feel really safe going out in
the back country with him.


18
0:0:56,4 --> 0:0:57,1
He knows his shit.


19
0:0:57,1 --> 0:1:1,11
And it's just like, tell
me what to do, dude.


20
0:1:1,11 --> 0:1:4,31
BRYAN IGUCHI: First I'm trying
to identify any weak layers in


21
0:1:4,31 --> 0:1:5,37
the snow path.


22
0:1:5,37 --> 0:1:9,13
So looking here, I see
here is a layer.


23
0:1:9,13 --> 0:1:10,34
I want to test this layer.


24
0:1:10,34 --> 0:1:12,91
This is the new snow
that we had in the


25
0:1:12,91 --> 0:1:15,32
last couple of days.


26
0:1:15,32 --> 0:1:18,2
And first, let's check
densities.


27
0:1:18,2 --> 0:1:21,66
So this is the kind of layer
I'm looking at right here.


28
0:1:21,66 --> 0:1:26,102
If I want to test that, I do
a compression tap test.


29
0:1:26,102 --> 0:1:29,94
MIKE RANQUET: Bryan Iguchi
definitely embodies or


30
0:1:29,94 --> 0:1:33,13
epitomizes the Jackson
Hole rider.


31
0:1:33,13 --> 0:1:39,4
In the mid to late '90s, he just
disappeared there without


32
0:1:39,4 --> 0:1:41,66
a plan, just went there to get
away to the mountains.


33
0:1:41,66 --> 0:1:44,64
And that's one of the few
places, I think, in the United


34
0:1:44,64 --> 0:1:49,42
States where you can still do
that without the Mickey Mouse


35
0:1:49,42 --> 0:1:55,872
hype of major ski areas.


36
0:1:55,872 --> 0:1:56,38
BRYAN IGUCHI: OK.


37
0:1:56,38 --> 0:2:3,438
So now I'm just isolating a
column of snow and then


38
0:2:3,438 --> 0:2:4,81
cutting it back.


39
0:2:4,81 --> 0:2:7,83
So this is a free-standing
block of snow.


40
0:2:7,83 --> 0:2:12,936
I'm going to do a shovel tap
test and look for any shears.


41
0:2:12,936 --> 0:2:15,93



42
0:2:15,93 --> 0:2:16,61
One.


43
0:2:16,61 --> 0:2:20,7
I've got immediate shearing,
I got an easy shear.


44
0:2:20,7 --> 0:2:21,9
BJORN LEINES: Down about
eight inches?


45
0:2:21,9 --> 0:2:22,47
BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah.


46
0:2:22,47 --> 0:2:25,77
I'd say down 20 centimeters.


47
0:2:25,77 --> 0:2:28,345
OK, really soft, so
I'm guessing a


48
0:2:28,345 --> 0:2:30,2
storm interface layer.


49
0:2:30,2 --> 0:2:31,27
One.


50
0:2:31,27 --> 0:2:34,6



51
0:2:34,6 --> 0:2:35,85
Four.


52
0:2:35,85 --> 0:2:39,562



53
0:2:39,562 --> 0:2:43,48
WILLIE MCMILLON: I think a lot
of the pros these days like--


54
0:2:43,48 --> 0:2:47,29
a lot of what I see is these
kids growing up in the park.


55
0:2:47,29 --> 0:2:49,99
And then they're like, wow,
I'm making a lot of money.


56
0:2:49,99 --> 0:2:52,66
I guess I've got to learn
how to ride powder now.


57
0:2:52,66 --> 0:2:53,94
And then they go out in
the back country.


58
0:2:53,94 --> 0:2:55,7
And it's like they can't
ride a sled.


59
0:2:55,7 --> 0:2:57,39
They don't know how
to dig a pit.


60
0:2:57,39 --> 0:3:0,21
They probably can't even find
a transceiver buried in the


61
0:3:0,21 --> 0:3:1,486
yard, you know?


62
0:3:1,486 --> 0:3:6,93
And I think he's kind of
the regulator of that.


63
0:3:6,93 --> 0:3:9,23
If these crews come out, he's
not going to let kids


64
0:3:9,23 --> 0:3:9,91
get away with that.


65
0:3:9,91 --> 0:3:14,2
He's going to make them find a
peeps in his yard before he


66
0:3:14,2 --> 0:3:15,27
takes them out.


67
0:3:15,27 --> 0:3:18,744



68
0:3:18,744 --> 0:3:19,73
BJORN LEINES: Solid
underneath.


69
0:3:19,73 --> 0:3:20,716
SHANE GRIMES: Are you
counting your packs?


70
0:3:20,716 --> 0:3:22,195
BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah.


71
0:3:22,195 --> 0:3:24,66
None of them are interesting.


72
0:3:24,66 --> 0:3:27,43
BJORN LEINES: This typically is
more of a continental snow


73
0:3:27,43 --> 0:3:29,355
pack up here where we are?


74
0:3:29,355 --> 0:3:31,73
BRYAN IGUCHI: It's more inner
mountain to some of the


75
0:3:31,73 --> 0:3:32,94
washouts down at the Tetons.


76
0:3:32,94 --> 0:3:36,33
But here, it's more like
Colorado style.


77
0:3:36,33 --> 0:3:37,66
It's colder, hollow,
[INAUDIBLE].


78
0:3:37,66 --> 0:3:38,42
BJORN LEINES: Yeah,
you know that.


79
0:3:38,42 --> 0:3:40,888
BRYAN IGUCHI: Not
as much snow.


80
0:3:40,888 --> 0:3:42,346
BJORN LEINES: Right.


81
0:3:42,346 --> 0:3:44,65
BRYAN IGUCHI: Well, I wouldn't
want to be riding those big


82
0:3:44,65 --> 0:3:45,39
lines over there.


83
0:3:45,39 --> 0:3:47,8
BJORN LEINES: Fuck no.


84
0:3:47,8 --> 0:3:51,196
I wouldn't want to be out on
anything hanging or anything


85
0:3:51,196 --> 0:3:52,82
not supported.


86
0:3:52,82 --> 0:3:54,8
BRYAN IGUCHI: Hear that
crust layer there?


87
0:3:54,8 --> 0:3:56,78
WILLIE MCMILLON: A lot
of times we're not


88
0:3:56,78 --> 0:3:57,53
into it, you know?


89
0:3:57,53 --> 0:3:59,8
We'll go out, and he'll be
like, let's dig a pit.


90
0:3:59,8 --> 0:4:1,64
And you're just like,
dude, seriously?


91
0:4:1,64 --> 0:4:4,2
And we'll dig a nine-foot pit.


92
0:4:4,2 --> 0:4:4,88
And then we're worked.


93
0:4:4,88 --> 0:4:7,94
And we can't even strap
in, you know?


94
0:4:7,94 --> 0:4:10,32
But he's diligent about it.


95
0:4:10,32 --> 0:4:11,37
BRYAN IGUCHI: OK, I'm guessing
it's going to pop


96
0:4:11,37 --> 0:4:12,62
somewhere in here.


97
0:4:12,62 --> 0:4:14,415



98
0:4:14,415 --> 0:4:15,665
BJORN LEINES: What's that?


99
0:4:15,665 --> 0:4:18,215



100
0:4:18,215 --> 0:4:19,17
BRYAN IGUCHI: Let's
see if I can--


101
0:4:19,17 --> 0:4:22,93
this is such a delicate block.


102
0:4:22,93 --> 0:4:23,765
Oh, OK.


103
0:4:23,765 --> 0:4:25,97
Oh, I'm seeing surface
over here.


104
0:4:25,97 --> 0:4:27,525
Oh, no, these are preserved
stellars.


105
0:4:27,525 --> 0:4:30,99
If you come here and
look at this.


106
0:4:30,99 --> 0:4:31,44
BJORN LEINES: Those
are-- yeah.


107
0:4:31,44 --> 0:4:31,94
BRYAN IGUCHI: That's a storm


108
0:4:31,94 --> 0:4:34,34
interface, perfectly preserved.


109
0:4:34,34 --> 0:4:35,26
OK.


110
0:4:35,26 --> 0:4:36,18
BJORN LEINES: Mm-hm.


111
0:4:36,18 --> 0:4:36,57
Look at how huge they are.


112
0:4:36,57 --> 0:4:38,8
BRYAN IGUCHI: I know.


113
0:4:38,8 --> 0:4:39,12
BJORN LEINES: Those didn't
get big, they just--


114
0:4:39,12 --> 0:4:39,83
BRYAN IGUCHI: They just
melt right away.


115
0:4:39,83 --> 0:4:40,71
BJORN LEINES: Mm-hm.


116
0:4:40,71 --> 0:4:42,73
BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah, you see
how they [INAUDIBLE].


117
0:4:42,73 --> 0:4:45,8
So basically, it's a storm
interface layer.


118
0:4:45,8 --> 0:4:48,75
So it was a temperature
change or whatever.


119
0:4:48,75 --> 0:4:50,13
A little density change there.


120
0:4:50,13 --> 0:4:53,94
BJORN LEINES: This is what you
don't want, one from the hand.


121
0:4:53,94 --> 0:4:55,84
And it's easy style
of breaking off.


122
0:4:55,84 --> 0:4:58,2
BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah.


123
0:4:58,2 --> 0:4:59,15
DAVE DOWNING: Jackson Hole?


124
0:4:59,15 --> 0:4:59,37
Yeah.


125
0:4:59,37 --> 0:5:3,39
I think it's always been
kind of a rad place to


126
0:5:3,39 --> 0:5:4,2
snowboard, you know?


127
0:5:4,2 --> 0:5:6,84
A lot of old Fall Line films
are filmed in Jackson Hole.


128
0:5:6,84 --> 0:5:10,32
And then there's always cycles
in snowboarding, like certain


129
0:5:10,32 --> 0:5:11,62
places become popular,
you know?


130
0:5:11,62 --> 0:5:13,76
And then they kind of
fade off, you know?


131
0:5:13,76 --> 0:5:15,19
One year it might be Colorado.


132
0:5:15,19 --> 0:5:18,24
One year it might
be Utah, Tahoe.


133
0:5:18,24 --> 0:5:19,99
And right now, I think
a lot of people are


134
0:5:19,99 --> 0:5:21,0
going to Jackson Hole.


135
0:5:21,0 --> 0:5:22,7
They're having a
killer winter.


136
0:5:22,7 --> 0:5:23,42
And so a lot of people
are going there.


137
0:5:23,42 --> 0:5:25,33
[LAUGHS]


138
0:5:25,33 --> 0:5:28,72
KEVIN JONES: His progression
is always a step ahead.


139
0:5:28,72 --> 0:5:31,81
Pretty soon, I think, it's going
to be protocol that all


140
0:5:31,81 --> 0:5:34,48
these riders that are venturing
in the back country,


141
0:5:34,48 --> 0:5:36,84
but they don't know things
about the back country.


142
0:5:36,84 --> 0:5:41,71
It's like this white stuff that
you love, it can kill you


143
0:5:41,71 --> 0:5:44,16
very easily on the wrong day.


144
0:5:44,16 --> 0:5:49,24
And Guch, you know, everybody
he's around, it's like just


145
0:5:49,24 --> 0:5:53,15
having him around makes the
whole crew more aware of


146
0:5:53,15 --> 0:5:54,455
what's going on around us.


147
0:5:54,455 --> 0:5:56,11
BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah, OK.


148
0:5:56,11 --> 0:5:58,38
This is a crystal screen
in a loop.


149
0:5:58,38 --> 0:6:1,2
So it's a magnifying glass.


150
0:6:1,2 --> 0:6:3,84
You just look to see what the
snow crystals that the failure


151
0:6:3,84 --> 0:6:5,28
surface is on.


152
0:6:5,28 --> 0:6:8,38
Yeah, it's definitely some
old surface hoar.


153
0:6:8,38 --> 0:6:10,13
TRAVIS RICE: It's one thing if
you're just going out and


154
0:6:10,13 --> 0:6:11,14
riding and having fun.


155
0:6:11,14 --> 0:6:15,35
But if you're trying to shoot
with photographers or film,


156
0:6:15,35 --> 0:6:16,92
man, it's a whole
other dynamic.


157
0:6:16,92 --> 0:6:19,5
You've got to time things right
with what time of day


158
0:6:19,5 --> 0:6:21,19
you should be at
certain places.


159
0:6:21,19 --> 0:6:22,49
The snow's bad here.


160
0:6:22,49 --> 0:6:25,93
You should try here, all the
different zones that surround


161
0:6:25,93 --> 0:6:27,4
this area here in Jackson.


162
0:6:27,4 --> 0:6:32,74
And for me, for two years, it
was amazing being lucky enough


163
0:6:32,74 --> 0:6:36,25
to ride here locally with a guy
like Guch who had put in a


164
0:6:36,25 --> 0:6:39,75
bunch of years all by himself,
basically, trying to figure it


165
0:6:39,75 --> 0:6:40,536
out for himself.


166
0:6:40,536 --> 0:6:42,4
KEVIN JONES: Safety is huge.


167
0:6:42,4 --> 0:6:44,855
I mean, he's watched one of his
friends die right in front


168
0:6:44,855 --> 0:6:46,93
of his eyes, you know?


169
0:6:46,93 --> 0:6:50,77
When Tristan died, that same
year Craig Kelly died and Jeff


170
0:6:50,77 --> 0:6:51,4
Anderson died.


171
0:6:51,4 --> 0:6:54,5
It was like, holy shit.


172
0:6:54,5 --> 0:6:55,4
I guess, all of a sudden,
it isn't just


173
0:6:55,4 --> 0:6:56,3
happening to other people.


174
0:6:56,3 --> 0:6:58,26
It's people within our--


175
0:6:58,26 --> 0:7:2,89
this is really hitting
home now, you know?


176
0:7:2,89 --> 0:7:5,2
BRYAN IGUCHI: It's a lot more
reactive here than it is in


177
0:7:5,2 --> 0:7:5,996
the Tetons.


178
0:7:5,996 --> 0:7:6,69
SHANE GRIMES: Yeah?


179
0:7:6,69 --> 0:7:7,3
BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah.


180
0:7:7,3 --> 0:7:9,59
It's all changes in whether.


181
0:7:9,59 --> 0:7:11,33
That's a really firm
block of snow.


182
0:7:11,33 --> 0:7:14,108



183
0:7:14,108 --> 0:7:16,93
SHANE GRIMES: So that was a
couple of storms ago, a real


184
0:7:16,93 --> 0:7:18,227
heavy, wet one?


185
0:7:18,227 --> 0:7:18,981
BRYAN IGUCHI: And you
see all that?


186
0:7:18,981 --> 0:7:23,45
It's just like facets,
like sugar.


187
0:7:23,45 --> 0:7:24,5
So you could propagate--


188
0:7:24,5 --> 0:7:29,42
it could step down
further down.


189
0:7:29,42 --> 0:7:32,715
It's definitely not a good
looking snow pack.


190
0:7:32,715 --> 0:7:37,4
I wouldn't want to go on
anything too big or anything


191
0:7:37,4 --> 0:7:39,16
with a high consequence.


192
0:7:39,16 --> 0:7:42,525
I feel good about just small
landings, jumps and things


193
0:7:42,525 --> 0:7:43,531
we've been doing.


194
0:7:43,531 --> 0:7:45,14
But I wouldn't want to ride
too many big lines.


195
0:7:45,14 --> 0:7:45,815
SHANE GRIMES: Yeah.


196
0:7:45,815 --> 0:7:46,611
BRYAN IGUCHI: No, I wouldn't
want to ride


197
0:7:46,611 --> 0:7:49,5
any big lines here.


198
0:7:49,5 --> 0:7:50,905
Like I wouldn't go in
there right now.


199
0:7:50,905 --> 0:7:54,44
PAT BRIDGES: A lot of people
say, why doesn't snowboard


200
0:7:54,44 --> 0:7:59,84
media focus as much attention
on the pedigree of the sport


201
0:7:59,84 --> 0:8:3,83
or what the legends are doing
now or guys who are 40 years


202
0:8:3,83 --> 0:8:7,63
old and pro still and stuff?


203
0:8:7,63 --> 0:8:10,9
Well, the guys who are 40 and
pro still don't ride like Guch


204
0:8:10,9 --> 0:8:12,43
does or as much as Guch does.


205
0:8:12,43 --> 0:8:15,88
Or they've stopped progressing
or evolving themselves.


206
0:8:15,88 --> 0:8:17,6
He never stopped.


207
0:8:17,6 --> 0:8:20,51
SHANE GRIMES: So we're going
to hit some small jumps, or


208
0:8:20,51 --> 0:8:23,9
jump with protected landings.


209
0:8:23,9 --> 0:8:24,58
Try to keep this safe.


210
0:8:24,58 --> 0:8:26,63
BRYAN IGUCHI: Try, yeah.


211
0:8:26,63 --> 0:8:29,45
PAT BRIDGES: It just so happens,
because of his stoke


212
0:8:29,45 --> 0:8:34,45
on riding, he's gone from riding
in Jackson Hole with


213
0:8:34,45 --> 0:8:37,5
guys like Lance Pittman and
Willie McMillon to riding with


214
0:8:37,5 --> 0:8:43,58
the next generations of Jackson
riders like the Rices


215
0:8:43,58 --> 0:8:47,1
and Mark Carters and to ride
in the next generation of


216
0:8:47,1 --> 0:8:48,15
Jackson Hole riders.


217
0:8:48,15 --> 0:8:50,84
And that's just because he's
in the lift line and he's


218
0:8:50,84 --> 0:8:51,94
riding every day.


219
0:8:51,94 --> 0:8:54,18
BILLY ANDERSON: He's
just dedicated.


220
0:8:54,18 --> 0:8:57,79
And I think that that's gotten
him to where he is, is he


221
0:8:57,79 --> 0:8:59,29
loves snowboarding.


222
0:8:59,29 --> 0:9:2,69
And I think he was really
committed, coming from a


223
0:9:2,69 --> 0:9:7,47
pretty hard core skate and surf
background in Los Angeles


224
0:9:7,47 --> 0:9:9,64
and taking that to the snow.


225
0:9:9,64 --> 0:9:12,61
He kind of had not a chip on his
shoulder, but he was tough


226
0:9:12,61 --> 0:9:13,36
and focused.


227
0:9:13,36 --> 0:9:16,27
BRYAN IGUCHI: Well, for a few
years now I've just start


228
0:9:16,27 --> 0:9:19,98
taking some more advanced
avalanche courses.


229
0:9:19,98 --> 0:9:22,177
I did my Level 1 in
Canada at the


230
0:9:22,177 --> 0:9:23,84
Professional Operations class.


231
0:9:23,84 --> 0:9:25,83
I'm trying to get my head
wrapped around more of the


232
0:9:25,83 --> 0:9:28,62
science part of it.


233
0:9:28,62 --> 0:9:30,67
You get experience
in the mountains.


234
0:9:30,67 --> 0:9:34,87
And you kind of get a feeling
for what's going on and make


235
0:9:34,87 --> 0:9:38,48
decisions on what you've
seen in the past.


236
0:9:38,48 --> 0:9:42,62
You get an idea of what
signs to look out for.


237
0:9:42,62 --> 0:9:45,28



238
0:9:45,28 --> 0:9:47,38
I'm on more of a mission
now to quantify what


239
0:9:47,38 --> 0:9:48,89
I'm seeing and why.


240
0:9:48,89 --> 0:9:51,57
So I'm getting more into looking
at the structure of


241
0:9:51,57 --> 0:9:54,71
the snow pack and looking
at the more


242
0:9:54,71 --> 0:9:56,48
scientific part of it.


243
0:9:56,48 --> 0:11:56,48
