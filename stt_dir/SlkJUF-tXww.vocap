###4 Hello, I'm Michael Dawson from Northern Brewer and I'm brewing
###8 an all-grain batch with our deluxe all-grain system today.
###11 This is the five gallon version
###13 with two five-gallon coolers.
###15 We also have a ten gallon version with ten-gallon coolers.
###19 The five-gallon version
###21 is big enough for most
###23 five-gallon all-grain batches if you brew mostly session beers,
###27 anything up to about doppelbock strength,
###30 you can use the system for years.. your entire all-grain career and be totally happy.
###34 
###35 If you brew ten-gallon batches or if you start getting into really big beers like
###40 barleywines in the five-gallon size
###43 consider the ten-gallon system.
###44 The deluxe all-grain system includes two major components:
###49 the mash/lauter tun and the hot liquor tank.
###52 This is a good moment to mention some brewer's terminology.
###56 
###57 "Liquor" in brewing doesn't refer to whiskey or tequila,
###60 it refers to water that has been treated for brewing. So the hot liquor tank
###64 is where we hold hot liquor
###66 
###68 hot brewing water
###69 for the sparge.
###71 Mash/lauter tun is where we mash and lauter
###75 grain is mixed with hot water
###77 to create wort
###79 
###80 and then lautered (or separated from the solids)
###83 and to accomplish that the mash lauter tun has a perforated, domed
###88 stainless steel screen called a false bottom.
###92 that will keep the grain inside
###94 while letting the wort drain into your boil kettle.
###96 
###98 Some of the advantages of this system are: insulation.
###101 Coolers will hold the temperature very well. When you're all-grain brewing,
###105 
###105 the temperature of the mash is pretty critical. It affects the outcome of the finished beer quite a bit.
###110 
###111 Being able to hold a steady consistent mash temperature for hours on end is real plus.
###116 
###119 All the coolers -- five and ten gallon -- also include graduations inside
###123 
###125 which makes measuring out your brewing water very easy.
###129 
###130 Finally, draining and transferring liquid from both of the vessel is as hands-free as just opening a valve and letting gravity do the hard work.
###135 
###138 
###140 When you get your deluxe all-grain system there's a little bit of assembly required but if I can do it, anybody can do it
###143 
###145 
###146 The coolers come with a factory spigot installed.
###150 Before we can actually brew with it,
###152 we need to replace that
###153 with the ball valves like I've already done on this one.
###156 Very easy you just need three things:
###160 crescent wrench
###162 pliers
###164 and a roll of teflon tape which is available from Northern Brewer or a hardware store,
###169 which may be where you had to go to get these things anyways.
###172 Let's get into it.
###177 There's a nut and a spigot on the inside fo the cooler
###181 that needs to be removed,
###182 to take the spigot out.
###184 I've already looseen in this one up a bit with the crescent wrench
###189 so i can finish getting it
###191 by hand.
###196 Three pieces - there's the nut
###200 gasket
###201 and the spigot itself.
###202 The valve assemblies have two components:
###205 the bulkhead which goes inside the cooler...
###209 and the valve proper
###210 which goes on the outside of the cooler like you can see
###213 on this one here.
###215 The bulkhead itself as a few parts
###218 but the two we need to be concerned with
###221 are the big hex nut...
###224 and a big silicone O-ring.
###227 These go on the outside of the cooler.
###229 
###230 The rest of the bulkhead goes on the inside.
###232 
###233 The bulkhead goes inside their cooler
###237 with coupling facing in,
###240 and threaded nipple facing out.
###245 Back on the outside
###248 the big O-ring
###251 gets snugged up against the cooler wall
###253 followed by the hex nut
###256 with the flat side facing out.
###261 Hand-tighten.
###265 And use the crescent wrench on the outside...
###268 the pliers on the inside to hold the coupling...
###277 tighten it down.
###280 Next, we use a few inches of teflon tape
###284 to wrap the threads
###286 and help make a watertight seal
###289 when we put the ball valve on.
###297  [tightening components]
###311 Finally, a little more teflon tape to wrap the threads of the barbed fitting into the ball valve.  [tightening]
###334 
###341 Now that we're ready for brewday, we need one more piece  of sophisticated equipment
###346 to make a gravity fed, tiered, brewing system.
###348 
###348 [moves chair across floor]
###354 Hot liquor tank will be the highest point
###358 mash/lauter tun in the middle
###360 and your boil kettle of choice which is not included with the all-grain system
###364 will be on the floor
###366 to receive the wort from the mash/lauter tun.
###369 To transfer the liquid from vessel to vessel, the deluxe all-grain system
###374 come with a couple sets of hoses.
###377 There's a clear, high-temperature hose
###380 to drain the mash/lauter tun into the boil kettle.
###386 Clear hose allows you to evaluate the color and clarity of the wort
###390 coming out of the mash/lauter tun. The second hose is an opaque
###394 high-temperature hose
###396 to drain sparge water from the hot liquor tank
###399 into the mash/lauter tun.
###403 This piece has a diverter tip, a little siphon sprayer on the end
###405 
###408 to diffuse
###409 the hot water coming out
###412 and deliver a gentle trickleinstead of
###414 a full-bore stream
###416 that could channel a hole straight down into the grain bed
###419 and have some adverse effects on the finished beer.
###423 To actually start moving liquid all you have to do is open one valve...
###430 open another valve...
###435 and wort will be flowing into the boil kettle.
###438 Leaving both hands free for beer
###440 
###442 or more important things like taking notes.
###445 This is the deluxe all grain system from northern brewer.
###448 Happy brewing and cheers! www.northernbrewer.com
