1
0:0:2,75 --> 0:0:6,4
and if behavior were fixed, we'd still be
living in caves. We couldn't learn how to


2
0:0:6,4 --> 0:0:19,77
drive a car. We couldn't alter our patterns.
Fortunately, people grow up, get old and die


3
0:0:19,77 --> 0:0:26,39
and that gives the new generation a chance
for newer responses to the environment. By


4
0:0:26,39 --> 0:0:32,699
responses, I mean reactions. All you get in
the environment is a reaction. If you've been


5
0:0:32,699 --> 0:0:41,29
brought up as a baby, with bears an lions
all tame and you go into the woods you'd be


6
0:0:41,29 --> 0:0:48,0
torn to pieces, if you use that reaction system.
If you're brought up with wolves and lions


7
0:0:48,0 --> 0:0:54,7
and elephants all tamed and you walk into
the jungle you won't live very long, with


8
0:0:54,7 --> 0:1:3,52
that attitude. But no one can know except
the reaction they get. Is that clear? I was


9
0:1:3,52 --> 0:1:10,57
told that a rattle snake has rattles on it's
tail, and they move to warn you. They don't


10
0:1:10,57 --> 0:1:17,29
move to warn you, they move period. A rattle
snake doesn't know to warn you he's going


11
0:1:17,29 --> 0:1:23,99
to bite, that is his reaction to you and it
makes noise. All snakes tails move, did you


12
0:1:23,99 --> 0:1:31,38
know that? When they see people whether the
rattle is there or not. The normal person


13
0:1:31,38 --> 0:1:37,13
projects - the rattles are there to warn you,
or an animal looks hideous or has patterns


14
0:1:37,13 --> 0:1:43,29
that look like eyes to scare you. There is
some animals that have circles on the back


15
0:1:43,29 --> 0:1:48,86
of the head and they say the purpose of that
is so that if something approaches from the


16
0:1:48,86 --> 0:1:57,18
rear, they'll think it is eyes - they don't
think about those things. Knowing the difference


17
0:1:57,18 --> 0:2:7,479
between human project and human reactions.
That is why love would be impossible - the


18
0:2:7,479 --> 0:2:14,3
actions that generate love 200 years ago are
not the same as they are today. So a person


19
0:2:14,3 --> 0:2:19,7
says do you think there is enough love in
the world? I don't know what they're talking


20
0:2:19,7 --> 0:2:26,78
about and I don't think they know. If they
say "do you feel that people are being oriented


21
0:2:26,78 --> 0:2:31,16
to their environment" - I know what they're
talking about. But if they say "do you think


22
0:2:31,16 --> 0:2:37,849
love will prevail?" - I don't think they know
what they're talking about. Love-do they mean


23
0:2:37,849 --> 0:2:45,92
extending maximum courtesy to people regardless
of the person? Well that would be ridiculous.


24
0:2:45,92 --> 0:2:56,31
You can't have a word like love without defining
what you mean by it. If by love you mean greeting


25
0:2:56,31 --> 0:3:4,4
everyone fairly and then doing a survey asking
how you can relate to that person. After that


26
0:3:4,4 --> 0:3:11,67
survey you say I might be able to relate to
them in 3 months if they listen - you don't


27
0:3:11,67 --> 0:3:20,3
know that, so you try. You, what you do is
manipulate variables in languages and the


28
0:3:20,3 --> 0:3:27,28
environment, if it works you take it on, if
it doesn't work you can easily get mad at


29
0:3:27,28 --> 0:3:32,47
the person depending on your reaction, or
you can say the person doesn't have enough


30
0:3:32,47 --> 0:3:41,86
to close that to understand what I'm talking
about. When a child says "I love my mommy"


31
0:3:41,86 --> 0:3:47,4
 - if mommy - if the child knows that mommy
feeds her, washes her, prevents her from when


32
0:3:47,4 --> 0:3:54,47
she gets injuries, takes care of her, she
associates love with moms devotion to her


33
0:3:54,47 --> 0:4:1,799
needs. When a guy says to a girl "I love you"
she says "what have you done to prove that?"


34
0:4:1,799 --> 0:4:10,99
She doesn't say that. How do you manifest
that? When a guy says to a girl, "I love you


35
0:4:10,99 --> 0:4:16,409
very much, more than anything in the world,
more than my life itself" the girl might be


36
0:4:16,409 --> 0:4:25,41
flattered, but he said nothing. Now, if a
person says "how can I meet your needs?" Well,


37
0:4:25,41 --> 0:4:33,85
if he is a nazi you say "go out and kill some
jews!" You'd be meeting his needs. But is


38
0:4:33,85 --> 0:4:41,63
meeting another persons needs love? Not necessarily.
Love is not only meeting their needs but giving


39
0:4:41,63 --> 0:4:47,83
them tools to fulfill their needs. Do you
know what that means? Like you - prepare that


40
0:4:47,83 --> 0:4:54,93
drink because you feel it is nourishing, more
nourishing than other systems. Ok, now if


41
0:4:54,93 --> 0:5:1,82
a person drinks that and has a very negative
attitude that will not nourish a person. Now


42
0:5:1,82 --> 0:5:10,49
let me tell you again. If you're born with
a good brain, high quality tissue, all the


43
0:5:10,49 --> 0:5:18,389
neurons in place, everything there, good,
it has no mechanism remember for knowing that


44
0:5:18,389 --> 0:5:23,889
which is relevant. The brain doesn't know
anything until it experiences something, like


45
0:5:23,889 --> 0:5:30,1
a certain bird with checkerboard pattern,
when it lands on you, then it pecks at your


46
0:5:30,1 --> 0:5:37,61
skin and hurts you, then you stay away from
birds with checkerboard pattern, but you can't


47
0:5:37,61 --> 0:5:45,53
inherit that knowledge, like look at the bird
and stay away from it without experience.


48
0:5:45,53 --> 0:5:50,62
You can't walk a tight rope unless you get
on something and try to balance yourself,


49
0:5:50,62 --> 0:5:56,93
over a long period of time. If you use a long
bamboo pole, there is a thing called inertia,


50
0:5:56,93 --> 0:6:3,319
the bamboo pole doesn't flex as fast as you
do, so you can do this and maintain stability


51
0:6:3,319 --> 0:6:10,1
with a long pole, and then you can shorten
the pole and that'll give you more and more


52
0:6:10,1 --> 0:6:16,55
experience in balancing. There is some people
who learn to balance faster than others, that


53
0:6:16,55 --> 0:6:22,8
is the structure of the semicircular canal
of the ear, and physical structure can give


54
0:6:22,8 --> 0:6:28,5
you a propensity toward learning to balance
a little faster than the other guy, I don't


55
0:6:28,5 --> 0:6:36,86
know if you understand that. Propensity means,
if you have 2 normal eyes, 1 has half the


56
0:6:36,86 --> 0:6:47,21
quality of the vision of the other you become
asymmetric, you know what I mean? If they're


57
0:6:47,21 --> 0:6:49,949
symmetric you stand a better chance. If the
brain is clean, meaning has no toxins in it,


58
0:6:49,949 --> 0:6:55,729
your response to the environment will not
be based on the cleanliness of the brain but


59
0:6:55,729 --> 0:7:3,69
the tribe you're brought up with. If they
say Moses is angry or Loeb did this, or that,


60
0:7:3,69 --> 0:7:10,53
that is using the brain well, if it corresponds
to the environment, but you can't study anything


61
0:7:10,53 --> 0:7:22,15
apart from the environment. Can you understand
that? Any problem with that? If you say "use


62
0:7:22,15 --> 0:7:27,819
your head" a person - you're telling them
to use tools they don't have, is what you're


63
0:7:27,819 --> 0:7:33,69
saying "use your head! Think about it!" well
that doesn't tell them anything, unless you


64
0:7:33,69 --> 0:7:40,13
give them tools, they don't know what tools
are, so you have to show them what tools are.


65
0:7:40,13 --> 0:7:49,319
Somebody wanted a bullet once that travels
around a corner, when you fire a gun it'd


66
0:7:49,319 --> 0:8:0,3
go round the corner, so he shaved one end
of the bullet so it was asymmetric instead


67
0:8:0,3 --> 0:8:3,229
of even 1 side was shaved, so the wind turned
the bullet around, if the gun - if it didn't


68
0:8:3,229 --> 0:8:10,139
rotate. Do you understand? If the bullet rotates
that doesn't do that. So an inventive mind


69
0:8:10,139 --> 0:8:20,75
is not an inborn process it's a person with
a hell of a lot of tools, that ask questions


70
0:8:20,75 --> 0:8:28,12
that are relevant. How can I make a bullet
turn? I don't know. If you're boat is asymmetric,


71
0:8:28,12 --> 0:8:36,32
not uniform, oddly shaped, point to 1 side
it'll go round in circles if you make a boat


72
0:8:36,32 --> 0:8:41,479
like that. Do you understand? How big should
a rudder be on an airplane? Nobody knows 


73
0:8:41,479 --> 0:8:47,589
- they build an airplane and the rudder is
too small, and it doesn't work too well, so


74
0:8:47,589 --> 0:8:54,7
they make it larger, sometimes they make it
too large. Just finding the right size meaning


75
0:8:54,7 --> 0:9:2,57
the best size for that plane is called research
 - "I don't know". A person that doesn't know


76
0:9:2,57 --> 0:9:10,44
anything would be a metaphysician because
they make assumptions. It's alright to make


77
0:9:10,44 --> 0:9:16,29
assumptions as long as you're - "these are
my assumptions" or "I'm speculating". Now


78
0:9:16,29 --> 0:9:24,29
there are scientists that are trying to find
out - "what is the universe?" Is the universe


79
0:9:24,29 --> 0:9:31,19
saying - I was reading that guy - what's his
name?


80
0:9:31,19 --> 0:9:31,98
- [UNKNOWN]


81
0:9:31,98 --> 0:9:33,57
- Kurz? - Kurzweil?


82
0:9:33,57 --> 0:9:39,56
He gets off in the middle of the book, and
he says "does the universe - is the universe


83
0:9:39,56 --> 0:9:45,26
intelligent?" Now what the hell does that
mean? - Is the universe intelligent? - He's


84
0:9:45,26 --> 0:9:52,14
trying to say that the universe may have a
built in program to evolve - he may be saying


85
0:9:52,14 --> 0:9:57,12
that. But if planets explode, and they're
all different distances, and they wobble,


86
0:9:57,12 --> 0:10:6,88
I don't know what he means by "does evolution
have an end goal?" Even if evolution did,


87
0:10:6,88 --> 0:10:14,16
say evolution makes a man more neural associations,
it has nothing to do with real value, because


88
0:10:14,16 --> 0:10:20,63
it only has to do with that organism, do you
know that means? If your brain evolved and


89
0:10:20,63 --> 0:10:29,91
your eyes become more efficient, in relation
to what? So how can you say the universe is


90
0:10:29,91 --> 0:10:36,24
evolving or becoming intelligent, except in
relation to something. If you don't know what


91
0:10:36,24 --> 0:10:41,95
that means, if the universe suddenly said
the sun is too bright we don't need that much


92
0:10:41,95 --> 0:10:47,99
sunlight for the amount of trees on earth,
and the sun dimmed down, cause it doesn't


93
0:10:47,99 --> 0:10:56,1
need all that burst of light. Then you can
say the conservation of energy seems to be


94
0:10:56,1 --> 0:11:3,99
built in, in some areas it does exist and
other areas it does not exist. They say the


95
0:11:3,99 --> 0:11:12,14
earth when it spins, wobbles a little, wobbles
meaning doing that, and some day it'll wobble


96
0:11:12,14 --> 0:11:20,31
more than others, so, is there a purpose to
the wobble? No but there's a cause to the


97
0:11:20,31 --> 0:11:27,47
wobble, not a purpose, always a cause to the
wobble. You know what that means? They say


98
0:11:27,47 --> 0:11:38,1
that planets explode- well, if you live 1
billionth of a second no planet ever explodes,


99
0:11:38,1 --> 0:11:44,829
do you know what that means? The higher you
go on an airplane, waves move, the higher


100
0:11:44,829 --> 0:11:52,459
you go, the smaller they become and more still
it appears, you can't see waves 6 miles up,


101
0:11:52,459 --> 0:11:59,87
all you can see is patterns in the ocean that
look frozen, the closer you get, the more


102
0:11:59,87 --> 0:12:7,67
fluid. So, what is the true nature of things?
That's not the question. "What is your response


103
0:12:7,67 --> 0:12:15,8
to nature?" Is the question. Do you know what
that means? What is your range of response


104
0:12:15,8 --> 0:12:21,279
to nature? You can't see a bacteria wagging
it's little tail, so all your books on life


105
0:12:21,279 --> 0:12:28,22
have to do with your receptors, not what's
around you. If you wrote you wrote a book


106
0:12:28,22 --> 0:12:35,519
on the absolute truth, it'd be a ridiculous
book because absolute truth freezes things


107
0:12:35,519 --> 0:12:42,38
 - "this is the truth - waves don't move they're
stationary" - well from high altitude - yes.


108
0:12:42,38 --> 0:12:48,48
If you lived 1 billionth of a second lighting
would be fixed, like a photograph, you wouldn't


109
0:12:48,48 --> 0:12:59,61
see it go down, so you can see your experience
change. They say that - I don't know how true


110
0:12:59,61 --> 0:13:8,29
it is but - certain types of insects see better
than we do, they can see a grain of sand fall,


111
0:13:8,29 --> 0:13:17,41
we don't. We just see it impact. There - 
probably a magnetometer can sense radio waves


112
0:13:17,41 --> 0:13:26,16
 - we can't. So, man builds instruments if
he wants to know those things. But the primitive


113
0:13:26,16 --> 0:13:35,45
man just looks at the world and grins, he
doesn't look at an airplane and say "how does


114
0:13:35,45 --> 0:13:43,17
that damn thing fly?" he has no curiosity
except he'll look at it - with his primitive


115
0:13:43,17 --> 0:13:48,48
tools, but he can't say "they've really advanced
that, the people who made that - they have


116
0:13:48,48 --> 0:13:56,13
an advanced way of thinking" - you understand?
He can't say that. Now you might see a person


117
0:13:56,13 --> 0:14:2,42
brought up in this culture, going to church
on Sunday, they're just as primitive as the


118
0:14:2,42 --> 0:14:10,43
head-hunters of the Amazon. Do you understand
that? Alright, I also mentioned many times


119
0:14:10,43 --> 0:14:18,279
that Indians take turkey feathers or big feathers
and make a hat, and if you point it out, the


120
0:14:18,279 --> 0:14:24,5
dancing around the fire with that hat does
absolutely nothing, they do not remove the


121
0:14:24,5 --> 0:14:33,29
hat and say "thank you for being so extensional".
Do you understand that? Ok, are they bad?


122
0:14:33,29 --> 0:14:39,17
No - are they mean? No, they're riding existing
paths. Their brain has a road right through


123
0:14:39,17 --> 0:14:48,149
it as rigid as any other road and they're
riding that path. That's why when a person


124
0:14:48,149 --> 0:14:55,13
says "let's be reasonable", they're trying
to superimpose experience with three words


125
0:14:55,13 --> 0:15:2,12
"let's be reasonable" - you can be reasonable,
you can learn to be reasonable - more so.


126
0:15:2,12 --> 0:15:9,3
Do you know what that means? Or "may I have
your attention?" you can only have the attention


127
0:15:9,3 --> 0:15:15,61
they can give you, do you know what that means?
When an officer walks into an army tent they


128
0:15:15,61 --> 0:15:20,79
say "attention!" meaning he's about to say
something, which you have to listen for "all


129
0:15:20,79 --> 0:15:28,44
you guys ought a be at point A at 4 o'clock"
well that's behavioral manipulation with few


130
0:15:28,44 --> 0:17:28,44
words - Yes?
