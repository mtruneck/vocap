JACOB SOBOROFF: For
the past three years,


3
0:0:4,57 --> 0:0:7,9
the Egyptian revolution
has been a roller coaster.


4
0:0:7,9 --> 0:0:9,85
Two presidents have been
deposed, thousands of people


5
0:0:9,85 --> 0:0:12,349
have died, and just yesterday,
the prime minister abruptly


6
0:0:12,349 --> 0:0:13,89
resigned his
government. "The Square"

0:0:13,89 --> 0:0:16,473

that gives a street-level look


8
0:0:16,473 --> 0:0:18,46

revolution since 2011.

right here.

Hi, guys.

JEHANE NOUJAIM: Hey, what's up?


18
0:0:33,96 --> 0:0:34,92
KARIM AMER: How are
you doing, YouTube?


19
0:0:34,92 --> 0:0:36,37
JACOB SOBOROFF: Guys, tell
us about the challenges


20
0:0:36,37 --> 0:0:37,33
of making a film like this.


21
0:0:37,33 --> 0:0:39,788
JEHANE NOUJAIM: All of us got
either arrested, tear gassed,


22
0:0:39,788 --> 0:0:42,6
shot at at various points
in the making of the film.


23
0:0:42,6 --> 0:0:43,39
JACOB SOBOROFF: When they first
debuted the movie at Sundance,


24
0:0:43,39 --> 0:0:44,52
it wasn't even
reallt done, right?


25
0:0:44,52 --> 0:0:45,87
JEHANE NOUJAIM: It was
a work in progress,


26
0:0:45,87 --> 0:0:47,449
and we promised all
of our characters


27
0:0:47,449 --> 0:0:49,24
that we would go back
and continue filming.


28
0:0:49,24 --> 0:0:51,45
Because we had a very neat
story from the bringing


29
0:0:51,45 --> 0:0:53,92
down of a dictator to the
election of a president.


30
0:0:53,92 --> 0:0:56,301
But the story wasn't over,
because all of our characters,


31
0:0:56,301 --> 0:0:57,8
when we were on the
way to Sundance,


32
0:0:57,8 --> 0:1:0,1
were back in the streets
again, basically saying,


33
0:1:0,1 --> 0:1:3,34
this newly-elected president,
first freely-elected president


34
0:1:3,34 --> 0:1:5,449
of Egypt, is using
the tools of democracy


35
0:1:5,449 --> 0:1:6,74
to create another dictatorship.

JACOB SOBOROFF: So these guys
just put the movie on YouTube


39
0:1:14,8 --> 0:1:15,64
for the people in Egypt.


40

What motivated that, and
how does it work exactly?


41
0:1:17,31 --> 0:1:18,61
KARIM AMER: YouTube
was an integral part


42
0:1:18,61 --> 0:1:19,44
of this revolution.


43
0:1:19,44 --> 0:1:22,16
When you live in a country where
the media is in full control


44
0:1:22,16 --> 0:1:24,61
and is lying about what's
happening on the ground,


45
0:1:24,61 --> 0:1:27,41
our young activists used
YouTube as their own channel


46
0:1:27,41 --> 0:1:28,63
to spread their stores.

JACOB SOBOROFF: Obviously,
right now there's


50
0:1:40,95 --> 0:1:43,44
protests in Venezuela,
unrest in the Ukraine.


51
0:1:43,44 --> 0:1:45,959
Why now is this time important
for people to see this film,


52
0:1:45,959 --> 0:1:46,5
do you think?

JEHANE NOUJAIM: What
these kids are fighting


54
0:1:48,333 --> 0:1:50,2
for is what this
country was founded on,


55
0:1:50,2 --> 0:1:51,83
which is civil
liberties and freedom


56
0:1:51,83 --> 0:1:53,426
of expression and human rights.


57
0:1:53,426 --> 0:1:55,55
I mean, it's the civil
rights struggle of our time.


58
0:1:55,55 --> 0:1:57,1
And that's what's
happening in Egypt


59
0:1:57,1 --> 0:1:59,5
right now as they're
being silenced.


60
0:1:59,5 --> 0:2:1,66
And so releasing this
film now and the support


61
0:2:1,66 --> 0:2:3,78
of the international
community makes it


62
0:2:3,78 --> 0:2:6,76
so that it's not just a
lonely fight of protesters


63
0:2:6,76 --> 0:2:7,92
