0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:9,48



2
0:0:9,48 --> 0:0:10,5
Mmm.

0:0:10,5 --> 0:0:14,82
[MUSIC PLAYING]


4
0:0:14,82 --> 0:0:15,69
RAVI KAPUR: My name
is Ravi Kapur.


5
0:0:15,69 --> 0:0:18,4
I am the executive chef
here at Prospect.


6
0:0:18,4 --> 0:0:20,62
We've been open a little
over a year.


7
0:0:20,62 --> 0:0:24,42
Before that I was at Boulevard
as a chef de cuisine.


8
0:0:24,42 --> 0:0:29,6
That was super influential on
how I think about food and how


9
0:0:29,6 --> 0:0:32,15
my cooking is influenced
by the guest.


10
0:0:32,15 --> 0:0:33,55
So we're not just--


11
0:0:33,55 --> 0:0:35,93
we're not serving macaroni and
cheese and fried chicken.


12
0:0:35,93 --> 0:0:40,64
But we are not isolating
ourselves, just cooking solely


13
0:0:40,64 --> 0:0:43,5
what we believe in and
not thinking about


14
0:0:43,5 --> 0:0:44,3
the guests as well.


15
0:0:44,3 --> 0:0:46,854
If people aren't coming
in, we're kind


16
0:0:46,854 --> 0:0:47,97
of missing the point.


17
0:0:47,97 --> 0:0:49,404
[MUSIC PLAYING]


18
0:0:49,404 --> 0:0:50,838
RAVI KAPUR: Thanks guys.


19
0:0:50,838 --> 0:0:51,316
[MUSIC PLAYING]


20
0:0:51,316 --> 0:0:52,75
-See ya tomorrow.


21
0:0:52,75 --> 0:0:53,228
-All right.


22
0:0:53,228 --> 0:0:56,59
-Have fun.


23
0:0:56,59 --> 0:0:57,61
RAVI KAPUR: We just
left Prospect.


24
0:0:57,61 --> 0:1:0,75
Got my girl, Nana, and we're
heading up to To Hyang for


25
0:1:0,75 --> 0:1:1,58
some Korean food.


26
0:1:1,58 --> 0:1:6,78
We rarely get out at the same
time, but I evacuated her.


27
0:1:6,78 --> 0:1:7,64
ROXANNA GUARDIA: [LAUGHING]


28
0:1:7,64 --> 0:1:8,77
RAVI KAPUR: Now we're going
to get some food.


29
0:1:8,77 --> 0:1:11,21
And the other two sous are going
to meet us when they're


30
0:1:11,21 --> 0:1:13,255
done closing up the shop.


31
0:1:13,255 --> 0:1:15,8
[MUSIC PLAYING]


32
0:1:15,8 --> 0:1:19,4
RAVI KAPUR: So I started cooking
in Waco, Texas, at a


33
0:1:19,4 --> 0:1:20,41
pizza parlor.


34
0:1:20,41 --> 0:1:21,64
All my friends worked there.


35
0:1:21,64 --> 0:1:22,61
I made pizzas.


36
0:1:22,61 --> 0:1:24,46
But I never considered
myself a cook.


37
0:1:24,46 --> 0:1:26,51
I was like, shit, I really
enjoy cooking.


38
0:1:26,51 --> 0:1:29,61
And I moved out to San
Francisco, went to culinary


39
0:1:29,61 --> 0:1:31,97
school out here in '98.


40
0:1:31,97 --> 0:1:35,48
And that's kind of where
it all really, I


41
0:1:35,48 --> 0:1:38,225
think, formally began.


42
0:1:38,225 --> 0:1:42,38
-We're just going to head
back out this way.


43
0:1:42,38 --> 0:1:44,38
RAVI KAPUR: I really like this
place because the woman that--


44
0:1:44,38 --> 0:1:47,73
she's the owner, she's the
proprietor, the chef.


45
0:1:47,73 --> 0:1:51,39
She pretty much makes all her
condiments and everything


46
0:1:51,39 --> 0:1:52,83
that's a part of her cooking.


47
0:1:52,83 --> 0:1:56,18
-This is where she keeps her
fermented bean paste.


48
0:1:56,18 --> 0:1:59,4
RAVI KAPUR: She makes it all
in house, which is not very


49
0:1:59,4 --> 0:2:0,13
common at all.


50
0:2:0,13 --> 0:2:4,2
-We try to keep it as close
to authentic as possible.


51
0:2:4,2 --> 0:2:5,83
RAVI KAPUR: Yeah, so
this is awesome.


52
0:2:5,83 --> 0:2:9,39
I'm inspired by the way she
approaches cooking.


53
0:2:9,39 --> 0:2:12,78
I don't think that if you're in
a really modest environment


54
0:2:12,78 --> 0:2:16,9
that the core philosophy of how
you cook should change.


55
0:2:16,9 --> 0:2:17,425
Maybe your ingredients
are different.


56
0:2:17,425 --> 0:2:19,42
Your price point is different.


57
0:2:19,42 --> 0:2:20,92
Your uniform might
be different.


58
0:2:20,92 --> 0:2:23,43
But the way that you approach
the food, and approach the


59
0:2:23,43 --> 0:2:27,1
ingredient, and how you deliver
it, I think should be


60
0:2:27,1 --> 0:2:30,4
at the highest level possible.


61
0:2:30,4 --> 0:2:34,26
From what I've had here, this is
probably my favorite dish,


62
0:2:34,26 --> 0:2:39,39
the ox tails and the dates,
just savory sweet thing.


63
0:2:39,39 --> 0:2:43,924
So this is a, what, 30-year-old
ginseng from the


64
0:2:43,924 --> 0:2:46,259
mother land.


65
0:2:46,259 --> 0:2:49,6
ROXANNA GUARDIA: [LAUGHTER]


66
0:2:49,6 --> 0:2:50,44
-I'm hungry.


67
0:2:50,44 --> 0:2:53,36
ROXANNA GUARDIA: We started
without you, sorry.


68
0:2:53,36 --> 0:2:58,67
RAVI KAPUR: So this is the
tofu bean paste, yeah?


69
0:2:58,67 --> 0:2:59,89
And then pork ribs.


70
0:2:59,89 --> 0:3:1,17
But that's the winner.


71
0:3:1,17 --> 0:3:4,0
And then this is
the pork belly.


72
0:3:4,0 --> 0:3:6,21
CHRIS WADE: Oh my god.


73
0:3:6,21 --> 0:3:9,83
RAVI KAPUR: Restaraunts aren't
just easy, and like super fun


74
0:3:9,83 --> 0:3:12,47
to do, and we make
a ton of money.


75
0:3:12,47 --> 0:3:15,12
It's a labor of love,
honestly.


76
0:3:15,12 --> 0:3:17,88
If you don't love it, it really
makes no sense as to


77
0:3:17,88 --> 0:3:19,26
why you would do it.


78
0:3:19,26 --> 0:3:22,65
We're new and we're just, as
far as-- we're working out,


79
0:3:22,65 --> 0:3:24,14
we're still working out kinks.


80
0:3:24,14 --> 0:3:27,4
We're learning stuff about
ourselves every day.


81
0:3:27,4 --> 0:3:31,45
But I feel like this is a place
that I don't need to be


82
0:3:31,45 --> 0:3:36,29
poaching pig balls and pig
bladders and cutting it open


83
0:3:36,29 --> 0:3:36,95
at the table.


84
0:3:36,95 --> 0:3:37,96
So there's not--


85
0:3:37,96 --> 0:3:41,94
while there are boundaries,
they are pretty vague.


86
0:3:41,94 --> 0:3:44,39
I can go pretty far
here, depending on


87
0:3:44,39 --> 0:3:46,18
how we package it.


88
0:3:46,18 --> 0:3:48,28
CHRIS WADE: I went to the
beach on Thursday.


89
0:3:48,28 --> 0:3:49,3
Over to Stinson beach.


90
0:3:49,3 --> 0:3:51,45
And it was kind of an
overcast cloudy day.


91
0:3:51,45 --> 0:3:53,11
I didn't feel the need to
put any sunscreen on.


92
0:3:53,11 --> 0:3:54,69
I was out sun bathing,
and didn't really


93
0:3:54,69 --> 0:3:55,4
think much of it.


94
0:3:55,4 --> 0:3:57,935
My feet are so swollen they
barely fit in my work shoes.


95
0:3:57,935 --> 0:4:1,26
RAVI KAPUR: He was like
walking around,


96
0:4:1,26 --> 0:4:2,62
it was really sad.


97
0:4:2,62 --> 0:4:3,91
[LAUGHTER]


98
0:4:3,91 --> 0:4:5,38
RAVI KAPUR: No, you guys
should eat it.


99
0:4:5,38 --> 0:4:7,328
I'm kind of getting full.


100
0:4:7,328 --> 0:4:10,18
ROXANNA GUARDIA: We're gonna
go get a burger, man.


101
0:4:10,18 --> 0:4:11,43
CHRIS WADE: We're gonna
get burgers?


102
0:4:11,43 --> 0:4:16,22



103
0:4:16,22 --> 0:4:18,22
RAVI KAPUR: This town is
like a ghost town.


104
0:4:18,22 --> 0:4:21,22
ROXANNA GUARDIA: It just dies
as the hours progress.


105
0:4:21,22 --> 0:4:22,29
Where do we go now?


106
0:4:22,29 --> 0:4:24,2
RAVI KAPUR: The only
place that's open.


107
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:26,5
-The only place that
will have us.


108
0:4:26,5 --> 0:4:30,35
RAVI KAPUR: Then we go to Nopa
where it's like super hip.


109
0:4:30,35 --> 0:4:32,37
And not intentionally
hip, but just fun.


110
0:4:32,37 --> 0:4:34,41
And they like doing
the right thing.


111
0:4:34,41 --> 0:4:36,25
Their liquor program
is banging.


112
0:4:36,25 --> 0:4:38,6
The wine list is killer.


113
0:4:38,6 --> 0:4:39,593
Food is delicious.


114
0:4:39,593 --> 0:4:44,79
[MUSIC PLAYING]


115
0:4:44,79 --> 0:4:47,25
RAVI KAPUR: First of all, they
use really great, really great


116
0:4:47,25 --> 0:4:49,24
ingredients.


117
0:4:49,24 --> 0:4:50,31
Lawrence is at them.


118
0:4:50,31 --> 0:4:54,48
I don't know, the last time he
told me, I think he goes to--


119
0:4:54,48 --> 0:4:56,25
I want to say 14
markets a week.


120
0:4:56,25 --> 0:4:57,44
But I might be exaggerating.


121
0:4:57,44 --> 0:5:0,3
But definitely seven days
a week, they're


122
0:5:0,3 --> 0:5:1,47
shopping at the markets.


123
0:5:1,47 --> 0:5:5,65
And I think with Prospect, it's
totally share the same


124
0:5:5,65 --> 0:5:7,76
philosophy and vision.


125
0:5:7,76 --> 0:5:9,47
Without great ingredients
it doesn't matter


126
0:5:9,47 --> 0:5:10,7
what you do to it.


127
0:5:10,7 --> 0:5:12,26
It's not going to be--


128
0:5:12,26 --> 0:5:15,6
where you take it if
it's mediocre.


129
0:5:15,6 --> 0:5:17,81
It's so amazing to be a
chef in San Francisco,


130
0:5:17,81 --> 0:5:18,78
especially right now.


131
0:5:18,78 --> 0:5:23,14
I feel like the network of
farmers, and growers, and


132
0:5:23,14 --> 0:5:29,19
purveyors that we have access
to is vast and increasing.


133
0:5:29,19 --> 0:5:32,44
I've been super fortunate
to have close


134
0:5:32,44 --> 0:5:34,4
relationships with farmers.


135
0:5:34,4 --> 0:5:38,79
I can drive an hour and a half
north and I can go to the farm


136
0:5:38,79 --> 0:5:42,51
where I get my goats from, or an
hour south and go see where


137
0:5:42,51 --> 0:5:45,39
my peppers are coming from,
and onions. and all that.


138
0:5:45,39 --> 0:5:46,58
It's kind of unique.


139
0:5:46,58 --> 0:5:48,5
-Yeah, I think all of us
started off in lesser


140
0:5:48,5 --> 0:5:50,3
restaurants, and enjoyed it.


141
0:5:50,3 --> 0:5:52,55
And kind of progressed
to where we are now.


142
0:5:52,55 --> 0:5:54,615
I didn't start in a restaurant
like Prospect.


143
0:5:54,615 --> 0:5:55,91
RAVI KAPUR: Yeah she [BLEEP]


144
0:5:55,91 --> 0:6:1,13
worked A.M. shift at a
cafeteria in Buffalo.


145
0:6:1,13 --> 0:6:2,224
-In Buffalo.


146
0:6:2,224 --> 0:6:13,59
[MUSIC PLAYING]


147
0:6:13,59 --> 0:6:15,79
-Most burgers are
gray and [BLEEP]


148
0:6:15,79 --> 0:6:18,38
That is nice and pink.


149
0:6:18,38 --> 0:6:20,74
RAVI KAPUR: Nice rind
on there, though.


150
0:6:20,74 --> 0:6:23,436
It's like fine, but
not too fine.


151
0:6:23,436 --> 0:6:26,6



152
0:6:26,6 --> 0:6:27,125
-They got it down.


153
0:6:27,125 --> 0:6:29,552
I guess after five years--


154
0:6:29,552 --> 0:6:31,524
-The best non-diner burger
in the city.

0:6:32,17 --> 0:6:37,45

157
0:6:37,45 --> 0:6:39,25
RAVI KAPUR: This is really all
I do, and all I've done.


158
0:6:39,25 --> 0:6:44,17
And all I ever really planned
to do is to cook and be in a


159
0:6:44,17 --> 0:6:47,18
restaurant that I believe in.


160
0:6:47,18 --> 0:6:50,1
Cook delicious food and take
care of your customer.


161
0:6:50,1 --> 0:6:52,96
That's really, it's really what
we're here for at the end


162
0:6:52,96 --> 0:6:53,99
of the day.


163
0:6:53,99 --> 0:6:56,21
I can't really see myself
cooking anywhere else.


164
0:6:56,21 --> 0:6:59,25
San Francisco is just great.


165
0:6:59,25 --> 0:6:59,85
So we'll see.
