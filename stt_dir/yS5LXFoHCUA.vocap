###2 <i>You asked out a girl</i> <i>stuck in an MRI machine</i>
###5 <i>without ever seeing her face,</i>
###7 <i>Remember no matter</i> <i>what she looks like</i>
###9 <i>be sure to play it cool,</i>
###12 Yes!
###14 Yes! You are smokin' hot!
###16 ln your face!
###20 <i>That night we went out</i> <i>on our first date,</i>
###23 <i>Had our first dinner,</i>
###27 <i>Rented our first movie,</i>
###31 <i>Took our first long drive,</i>
###34 Look out!
###36 <i>Killed our first raccoon,</i>
###38 <i>Ever since then every date we've</i> <i>been on has always ended the same way,</i>
###47 No!
###49 Cox wants me back at the hospital.
###51 - But the page is addressed to Lillian. - That's me.
###59 <i>What a drag,</i>
###63 <i>That was probably the wrong time</i> <i>to ask for a quickie,</i>
###79 l have been coerced
###82 by the forces of evil into conducting rounds this morning.
###85 Why do you have to do rounds?
###87 Because l'm sleepy. How's that?
###90 To make this a more palatable experience for <i>moi</i>
###93 l am not going to call you by your names. l'll be referring to you
###96 by whatever distinguishing physical characteristic occurs to me.
###100 You, Chicken Beak.
###102 What causes pneumonia presenting with diarrhoea?
###106 - Legionella. - Nice job.
###108 lt turns out your mind's just as sharp as your nose.
###111 And you, Dye Job.
###113 What are the elements of Whipple's triad?
###118 <i>It's hard to describe how scary</i> <i>it is when you don't know an answer,</i>
###126 l can't remember. l am so sorry.
###129 What are you sorry about?
###132 Dr Kelso yells at us when we don't know...
###134 Children,
###135 you can't let that bloated bag of hate affect you.
###139 Being a doctor is as much about finding the answers as knowing them.
###143 For instance, take Clarabelle's patient here, Mr Yeager.
###147 We have no idea what's wrong with him.
###149 So we have run tests for everything and according to these results...
###155 Everything seems to have come back negative.
###158 Which doesn't necessarily mean that Clarabelle is a failure.
###162 lt just means that she's got to keep trying,
###165 no matter how frustrated she might get.
###168 Now, of course, if you are lazy and incompetent,
###172 then, yes, that will buy you a one-way ticket out of here.
###176 Doug.
###177 Listen carefully. Kelso can't do a thing to you if you answer a question wrong.
###182 lt doesn't work that way. Moving on. Not you. You still have work to do.
###186 Johnny No-Tan? l'd like you to present the next patient to me.
###192 l love you.
###194 Now say it in Spanish.
###196 <i>Te amo,</i>
###198 Now... say it like Astro.
###201 l ruv roo.
###206 - You are very, very cute. - l know.
###210 l've been thinking about this ''l love you'' thing.
###213 lt's gonna make everything so much better.
###215 l mean, we're so in sync. Better conversation,
###219 better dancing...
###223 And?
###224 Way better shrumpdown.
###229 Yeah!
###245 l'm so sorry. That has never happened to me before.
###252 <i>Man she's beautiful,</i>
###255 <i>I wish I was that piece of bacon,</i> <i>Wait a second,</i>
###258 <i>I am that piece of bacon,</i>
###260 That's right.
###261 You mind not staring at me while l'm eating?
###265 l hate it.
###267 - But l'm not. - What am l doing right now?
###269 - Eating. - What are you doing?
###271 Staring.
###278 There. Now no one gets to eat it.
###281 - You happy? - Not really.
###290 You know what's great?
###292 Even when our dates get interrupted, we can have a date here.
###295 Let's say you wanted to watch a movie.
###298 We could go to the conference room and watch that video on STDs.
###302 lt's funny and it makes you think.
###304 Maybe it would be good if we actually had a date that
###308 - ends. - How does a date with you end?
###311 lt can range from a kiss at the door
###313 to ''all l have for breakfast is yoghurt and l'm out of bowls,
###317 so you'll have to eat off my stomach.''
###320 Tonight. Dinner. Hyde's.
###323 lt's a date.
###329 Judging from the ataxia dysarthria,
###331 l've concluded that Mr Yeager is suffering from... kuru.
###335 - Kuru? - Kuru.
###337 - Kuru? - Yes, kuru.
###339 - l'd actually never thought of that. - Hell, yeah.
###342 Were you aware that the only documented cases of kuru
###345 were members of a cannibalistic tribe in Papua New Guinea?
###348 - l was not. - Actually, doc,
###351 l was in New Guinea last week.
###353 - Really? - No.
###355 - Do you happen to know what a zebra is? - He just mocked me.
###360 lt's a diagnosis of an obscure disease
###363 when it's more likely to be a common illness with uncommon symptoms.
###368 ln other words, if you hear hoof beats,
###371 you just go ahead and think horsies, not zebras.
###375 Mm-kay, Mr Silly Bear?
###383 - What's wrong? - lt's personal.
###385 Why won't you ever open up to me? l came to you
###388 when l thought l had a broken tailbone and it was just a really bad pimple.
###392 lt's a sex thing. OK?
###395 Like a gender issue or like intercourse? Because l'm book-smart on both.
###401 Carla? Use me.
###408 - Last night, when l was with Carla... - Dude, l can't talk.
###411 l gotta figure this Mr Yeager thing out.
###414 Cool.
###417 My horse didn't finish the race.
###419 l'm at the filling station, but my credit card's declined.
###422 - l'm on the jet ski... - l got it!
###424 - Good. l had no idea what to say... - No. Mr Yeager.
###428 Where you go...? Who am l going to talk to about sex?
###432 Let's get our talk on.
###435 Player to player.
###437 <i>Afternoon rounds</i> <i>that day began like any other,</i>
###440 This patient is hypoglycaemic. What are the signs of an insulinoma, Dr Reid?
###445 Elevated C-peptide levels.
###447 Score! But before you do your crazy end-zone dance,
###451 tell me the spinal fluid findings in Guillaume-Barr√© syndrome.
###454 - Xanthochromia? - Wrong!
###457 <i>And then it happened, Suddenly</i> <i>Dr Kelso didn't seem as frightening,</i>
###461 Dr Reid, what do you have to say for yourself?
###465 Win some, lose some.
###467 <i>In fact nothing he did</i> <i>seemed to scare us,</i>
###473 <i>Not any more,</i>
###477 <i>Not even the most horrible thing</i> <i>he could think of,</i>
###484 All right, welcome to the lCU! No, really, sit down.
###487 For women that don't know how to cook. l put the Yellow Pages in there.
###491 What do you want? Mexican? ltalian? Japanese? American cuisine?
###495 lt's a cook... l'm flat-linin'. Beep!
###500 Save him!
###501 Tip your nurses.
###506 <i>And I think he knew</i> <i>who was behind it,</i>
###510 Cox.
###514 <i>Talk to me</i>
###520 You know, that's really getting annoying.
###523 Every time you say it, it makes me not want to talk to you all the more.
###529 <i>Talk to me</i>
###532 All right, fine!
###538 Last night, Turk and l were, you know, messin' around.
###542 - lt's really hot, like always. - Hot like how? Describe it.
###547 Dude!
###549 So suddenly, things aren't happening. You know what l mean?
###553 The only change is that we said ''l love you'' to each other.
###557 lt's true.
###558 l have never said ''l love you'' to a woman before.
###562 Then how do you get them to sleep with you?
###565 lt's three little words. lt shouldn't have this effect, right?
###569 Anyway, l told him it wasn't his fault. These things happen occasionally.
###574 Try constantly.
###576 l have cold hands, and...
###581 So when l saw you this morning and l said ''How's your penis?''
###585 and you didn't wanna talk about it...
###589 Dude. lt's not me.
###592 lt's me.
###594 Last night, for the first time ever in our relationship,
###597 no matter how long we tried,
###599 l was unable to have an...
###609 Dr Cox, l got the sed rate back on Mr Yeager. Say ''how do'' to that.
###613 But then l'm due back at the hootenanny.
###616 l noticed he had a rash. l realised he's been having jaw claudication,
###620 - which led me to... - Temporal arteritis.
###622 Of course. Nurse, start Mr Yeager on solumedrol and get the surgery resident?
###627 He needs a temporal artery biopsy stat.
###630 Newbie, l can handle this.
###632 - You're off, aren't you? - l'm with you.
###634 Fair enough. Let's go treat the patient.
###637 <i>I am so on top of things tonight</i> <i>it's scary,</i>
###647 Hell, yeah.
###651 <i>You're only 80 minutes late,</i> <i>She'll still be here,</i>
###654 <i>Please be here, Come on Alex,</i>
###656 <i>Please be here,</i>
###661 You gotta be kidding me.
###663 There's a waste of a gift certificate.
###666 Cancel the cobbler!
###668 She's not having an orgasm.
###672 Still not seeing what the problem is.
###679 l've never even had an orgasm.
###685 l'm sorry. l should be more surprised.
###688 That'd be nice.
###692 - l want to talk to you about rounds. - Here we go. Bring it on.
###696 They're all yours.
###699 You will be leading them from now on.
###701 You've stunned me, but you haven't dropped me to the mat.
###705 Waiting for the roundhouse here. The old haymaker,
###709 when the yelling starts and the voice gets high-pitched.
###712 ''Daddy, l've been bad. Daddy, l've been a bad boy.''
###715 ''Oh, Daddy! Daddy, l've been bad.''
###719 lf you're not gonna play, it's no fun.
###723 Hey, Alex, l am so sorry. l went to the restaurant but just missed you.
###727 Then l called, but there was no answer,
###730 then l stopped by, and l guess you didn't see me which was odd,
###734 cos l was standing next to the pizza guy while you were paying him.
###739 We're still cool, right?
###743 - Look, JD... - ''Look, JD, we're still great?''
###748 l think you're a really good guy. OK? But...
###752 - Alex dumped me. - The blind girl you've been dating?
###755 - She's not blind. - Of course not.
###757 How'd you drop the ball? Don't tell me you cried,
###760 or l'll ban you from the men's room again.
###762 l was so excited what we were doing here, l forgot about our date.
###768 <i>You didn't forget, You kept looking</i> <i>at your watch, I saw you,</i>
###773 l assumed that you were afraid of missing <i>Judging Amy,</i>
###776 lt never occurred to me you were choosing work
###779 over being with that sweet little biscuit.
###782 That means a lot coming from you,
###784 Mr Right-here-with-me two-hours-after-his-shift-
###788 and-last-Monday-night-too... guy.
###791 - What? - You heard me.
###793 Newbie, what're you saying?
###796 That you want to be like me?
###801 Do you understand that l just barely want to be like me?
###813 l can't even pretend l can give you tips on intercourse.
###817 l got one for you. Stop calling it that.
###819 My therapist thinks my trouble in bed stems from a fear of intimacy,
###823 but l think it's because any type of repetitive motion makes me nauseous.
###828 And since l was a kid, l've had nightmares about being crushed.
###832 That poor shrink.
###834 The one thing l do know is that l've sabotaged a lot of relationships
###838 by never talking things out with the guy that l'm seeing.
###843 - Thanks. - Sure.
###848 So... You've really never had...
###852 No.
###854 - Not even by yourself? - Gross.
###859 ls it easy?
###863 When's your next laundry night?
###865 Ted.
###867 l need you to take care of some lawyer crap for me.
###870 lt'd be great if you would go to traffic court for me and make this go away.
###876 l don't think so.
###879 Excuse me?
###881 No, Bob! l have my own things l need to take care of.
###887 Of course.
###892 Walk off, bitch.
###894 How is it, exactly, that you just said that
###897 and your pants are still dry?
###899 Don't you understand
###902 what you did when you spoke to those interns?
###905 You took away the fear.
###908 You... are a wonderful person,
###913 and... l love you.
###923 <i>I have to ask Alex</i> <i>for another chance, I have to,</i>
###926 <i>OK she's with a hot guy, Stay calm,</i> <i>She's gonna be psyched to see you,</i>
###931 JD. Hey.
###933 <i>Or not,</i>
###934 l don't prioritise you over my job, but l'd like to.
###938 l wanted to be a doctor for so long,
###941 l sort of forgot how to want anything else.
###943 And now l meet you, and...
###947 l'll do anything in the world if you give me a second chance.
###952 l'm sorry.
###956 l'll leave you guys alone.
###962 OK, Rowdy,
###964 fetch!
###966 Hey, sweetie?
###968 - We have to talk. - No time for talk.
###971 We have a problem we need to take care of.
###973 Why are you wearing a nose-breathing thingy?
###976 Baby, bear with me. l got big ideas.
###980 l've been having all these thoughts going through my head,
###984 and l'm afraid if l tell you, l'd scare you away.
###986 That's the last thing that l wanna... Take that damn thing off.
###992 Oh, God.
###995 Baby, there's nothing that could scare me away.
###1003 Since we said ''l love you'', l've been feeling all this pressure.
###1006 And wondering about the future. Our future.
###1009 Are we gonna get married? Are we gonna have kids?
###1012 lf so, when will l get my figure back?
###1014 Where are we gonna live? Will my mother live with us? How big a house?
###1018 How many bathrooms? What if she walks in on you
###1021 while you're in the bathroom, you fall, and l can't afford the funeral costs?
###1025 That's a little scary.
###1029 l guess l just need to know you think about that stuff too.
###1032 Carla?
###1037 No, l don't.
###1041 - But l love it that you do. - Yeah?
###1044 That's what makes this relationship work.
###1047 We're so different. l keep us in the present,
###1050 you look out for what's up ahead.
###1055 Besides, there is no way in hell
###1058 your mother's ever going to live with us.
###1061 lf she ever walks in on me while l'm in the bathroom,
###1064 she's getting a trip to Florida.
###1066 - No, she's not. - l'm tell...
###1070 Ladies and germs, if you get this shorthand down,
###1074 it has a way of making your day go quicker.
###1076 ''CTD'' being ''circling the drain.'' Your patient is on the way out.
###1080 ''SOB'', ''shortness of breath'' and ''WNL'', ''within normal limits''.
###1084 Elvis, feel free to write this down,
###1086 any time before you leave the building.
###1089 - You paged me? - l didn't page you.
###1092 <i>And that's when Dr Cox started</i> <i>poking the old bear with a stick,</i>
###1096 l'm sick of the grill 'em and drill 'em.
###1098 What do you say we shake things up?
###1101 You kids ask me the questions, and l'll just give you the answers.
###1106 Dr Cox, could l talk to you?
###1109 Sure, Bob, but you have to raise your hand like all the other children.
###1113 - l just think it's inappropriate... - Bob-o?
###1117 Now, you've got five good ones right there.
###1119 What do you say you put 'em up in the air like you just don't care?
###1124 Get over here, right now.
###1126 <i>Maybe he felt sorry for Kelso and</i> <i>didn't wanna take the one thing he had,</i>
###1130 <i>Maybe he just hated rounds,</i>
###1134 Get the hell outta my lCU!
###1136 <i>But if you didn't</i> <i>know Dr Cox like I did</i>
###1138 <i>you would've believed</i> <i>his performance too,</i>
###1142 <i>I guess the key</i> <i>to a lot of things is balance,</i>
###1145 <i>Whether it's balance of power,,,</i>
###1149 Dr Simotas, stop smiling.
###1152 l hate smiling.
###1157 <i>,,,balance in love,,,</i>
###1161 <i>,,,or sometimes,,,</i>
###1164 <i>,,,just balance,</i>
###1170 <i>For some of us</i> <i>it seems too far out of reach,</i>
###1186 <i>Too difficult to achieve,</i>
