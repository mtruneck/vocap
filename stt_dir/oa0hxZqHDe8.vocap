###0 STEVE SPANGLER: Well you've asked for magic and today
###1 you're going to get it because we're looking at the things
###3 that float.
###4 You know magicians can take ordinary objects like this
###6 completely ordinary piece of rope and cause it to float in
###9 the air because of their magic.
###11 Watch.
###12 I'm going cause it to float in the air, watch.
###14 I'll put a spell it, float.
###16 [SINGING]
###16 do, do, do, do.
###17 Isn't that amazing?
###19 And then they can break the spell.
###21 Break the spell.
###22 And then in ancient Hindu Faquirs would be in the
###26 streets of India and they can cause it float in the air like
###29 this, float.
###29 [SINGING]
###30 do, do, do, do.
###30 And they would climb to the top of it.
###31 [SINGING]
###32 do, do, do, do, do.
###34 Today, the science of things of-- hey.
###38 Higgensworth, why didn't you tell him to--
###43 fired.
###45 The things that float.
###47 I'm Steve Spangler and I'm all about making science fun.
###51 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###54 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###57 experiences.
###58 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###60 affect the way people think about science.
###64 And to do that I only have one motto.
###66 Make it big, do it right, give it class.
###68 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###74 Hey Higgens, I'll show you a trick.
###75 Here, watch this.
###75 Pick a card, pick a card, pick a card.
###77 Perfect.
###77 Look at it?
###79 Got it?
###80 Now, I want you to put it back in the deck wherever you want,
###83 that's perfect.
###84 All right, so it's lost in the deck, ready?
###86 A lot of mixing around, OK, I mixed it around.
###89 OK, now I'm going to find your card and I'm going to cause it
###92 to come right out of the deck, it's going to
###95 float out of the deck.
###96 Watch this, magic hand.
###98 [SINGING]
###98 do, do, do, do.
###101 Whoop.
###102 Got it, that is your card?
###105 BRYAN HIGGENS: No.
###106 STEVE SPANGLER: I know it is, it's for sure.
###108 BRYAN HIGGENS: Not at all.
###108 Weren't You raised by magicians?
###109 STEVE SPANGLER: Shut up, I don't have my
###110 magic wand with me.
###112 God, I knew I got it.
###114 I'm going to give a little cut like this, [WHISTLE].
###115 Bam, and is this your card, the eight of hearts?
###119 BRYAN HIGGENS: No.
###120 And I didn't sign it and it says Deb.
###123 STEVE SPANGLER: It's from another show I did.
###126 Any of these three cards yours?
###128 BRYAN HIGGENS: No, no they aren't.
###130 STEVE SPANGLER: Look at these cards and tell me
###132 if you yours anywhere.
###133 You see them?
###134 BRYAN HIGGENS: Yes.
###135 STEVE SPANGLER: You seem them?
###136 BRYAN HIGGENS: Yep.
###136 STEVE SPANGLER: Are we good?
###137 BRYAN HIGGENS: Yes.
###138 STEVE SPANGLER: Now I'm going to it a little shuffle.
###139 You see them at all?
###141 BRYAN HIGGENS: Yep.
###142 STEVE SPANGLER: You see it in there?
###143 BRYAN HIGGENS: Um, hmm.
###143 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, good.
###144 Do you see your card right here?
###146 BRYAN HIGGENS: Yes.
###147 STEVE SPANGLER: Ah, perfect.
###148 Do you see it in here?
###149 BRYAN HIGGENS: Yes I do.
###151 STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.
###151 Do you see it in here?
###152 BRYAN HIGGENS: No.
###153 STEVE SPANGLER: [BEEP]
###153 [BEEP], [BEEP].
###154 OK, is this your card right here, this queen?
###158 BRYAN HIGGENS: No.
###159 
###163 STEVE SPANGLER: Three and [INAUDIBLE].
###164 BRYAN HIGGENS: That's it.
###165 STEVE SPANGLER: See.
###165 Can you cut that?
###167 [BEEP]
###168 STEVE SPANGLER: Stand by in three, two.
###170 And out of all the cards that you picked and I shuffled them
###173 and threw them all on the floor, I'll pick up one card.
###175 Is this your card?
###177 BRYAN HIGGENS: That's it.
###178 STEVE SPANGLER: Thank you very much.
###180 BRYAN HIGGENS: Impressive.
###181 STEVE SPANGLER: Thanks.
###181 You ever see Criss Angel in Las Vegas like
###184 float up in the air?
###186 Easy.
###186 But another object like a Styrofoam cup, very tough.
###189 Ready, watch this.
###190 Do, ah.
###192 And you'll see that it's defying gravity.
###196 I got my finger in the the back of the cup.
###198 That's awesome.
###200 Don't tell you Higgensworth.
###203 Higgensworth, I'm going to do a cup trick.
###205 Well here, every man has one of these.
###207 All right, so you take a regular handkerchief like this
###210 and you take your hair out, [WHOOSH]
###211 and you tie it onto this thing here.
###213 And then you tie it here like this, and then you pull it
###215 down, and it floats.
###217 And then you take your scissors and you cut it.
###222 Magic.
###224 This will keep Higgensworth busy for hours.
###227 Higgensworth, get your scissors, come over here.
###231 [DOOR SHUTTING]
###232 For this you're going to need some uncooked rice and some
###235 recycled plastic water bottles.
###238 All right, so the rice goes down inside like this.
###240 You simply fill the container up like this.
###243 And you're going to do two of them so you want them to be
###245 exactly the same.
###246 And so you can see they'll the same, I filled that one
###248 previously.
###249 [HAND CLAP]
###249 So now we're ready to go.
###250 And you're going to need two chop sticks.
###253 All right, so here's what you do.
###254 You take your hand and you plunge it in like this.
###257 And now, only using your fingertips you pick this up
###260 like this and you realize it comes out.
###262 But this one here, watch.
###263 Ah, like magic, it floats.
###267 Now I know what you're thinking.
###268 You're thinking maybe it's the chopsticks and there's a
###271 secret with that.
###272 I switched chopsticks.
###273 I'm going to do the same thing again, watch this.
###275 It goes in there like this and it goes in here like and now
###277 you pick it up.
###278 Watch.
###279 The secret is look.
###282 This is light rice, gravity defying rice and
###287 this is heavy rice.
###289 I know what you're thinking, there's something
###290 wrong with the rice.
###291 There's not, watch this.
###292 We dump them out like this and the rice flows out like this.
###296 There is absolutely nothing wrong with it.
###298 If you look, there's nothing hiding in the bottles.
###301 Two empty bottles, the same amount of rice.
###304 
###307 Well of course it's not magic, it's science.
###309 And it actually is about the science of friction.
###312 And the guy who discovered friction, right here.
###315 Leonardo DiCaprio.
###316 BRYAN HIGGENS: Wait, wait, wait.
###317 STEVE SPANGLER: I actually got to meet him.
###318 He signed this to me back-- what?
###322 BRYAN HIGGENS: I said, see here, it was Leonardo da Vinci
###325 in the 16th century.
###327 STEVE SPANGLER: Di--
###327 BRYAN HIGGENS: Not DiCaprio, da Vinci.
###331 STEVE SPANGLER: Could you hang that back up on my wall?
###334 BRYAN HIGGENS: Yep.
###335 STEVE SPANGLER: Could you maybe work on
###336 your script as well?
###340 da Vinci.
###341 
###344 What you see is what you get.
###345 You're going to need the materials that
###346 I showed you before.
###347 Two empty water bottles, some rice, some chopsticks.
###350 That's it.
###351 It's how the rice goes into the bottle that's the secret.
###353 Let's do the light rice first.
###355 This is the gimmick-ed bottle so to speak.
###358 So we're going to fill it up with rice.
###360 Keep on putting rice in here until it's full.
###362 Have you ever seen that old puzzle where they fill a
###365 bottle with something, like pebbles and they say, is the
###368 bottle full?
###369 It's filled to the top with pebbles and somebody says yes.
###372 And you go no, no, no.
###373 And then they start pouring in sand and now the sand fills up
###376 the little crevices.
###377 And they say is it full?
###378 And everybody says yes.
###379 And you go no.
###379 And finally they fill it with water.
###381 And only at that point is it full.
###383 Well that's a long way of being able to tell you that
###385 this bottle is not full even though it looks like it's
###388 filled to the top with rice, like this.
###391 All right, see, it's full.
###393 But it's not really full.
###395 Here, watch this.
###396 All you have to do is tap it.
###397 And watch how the rice begins to compact.
###400 Look at how far down it will go.
###403 These plastic water bottles are great.
###405 The original-- this is an old, old magic trick and so the
###407 original one were these kind of fancy glass bottles, but
###410 these work so well.
###411 See how much more rice I can get in.
###412 All right, back to this.
###413 Some more will go in, I'll even push it in with my thumb
###416 a little bit.
###416 A little bit here.
###417 Tap it down.
###421 It'll even take a little bit more.
###422 All right, we don't want to make it look too obvious.
###424 All right, so this here is hard to squeeze, there's a lot
###428 rice that's in here.
###429 This bottle here, we're going to fill up, no tapping at all.
###432 We really want it to be very, very fluffy.
###434 
###436 I'm trying not to tap this down at all.
###438 I want this to be nice and fluffy, for there to be a lot
###441 of space in between all those pieces of rice.
###444 All right, I think it's really good at the very end to put it
###447 in there when you're actually doing the trick so it makes it
###449 seem like they're exactly the same.
###451 All right, so here's what's going to happen.
###452 I'll spin these around.
###453 This will be light one of course, and this
###455 is the heavy one.
###455 See, this one already started to go down a little bit, so
###458 you can fill it up.
###459 All right, with the chopstick, this one extremely easy to be
###462 able to push in because that chopstick is going in between
###465 those kernels of rice with no problem at all.
###467 But this one here is pretty amazing because when you push
###469 it down here like this, it's so full but you can actually
###472 hear it, listen.
###473 [RICE CRUNCHING].
###474 Hear it going in?
###475 What's happening are all those pieces of rice are realigning
###478 themselves this way.
###479 They are actually digging into the piece of wood.
###482 So no wonder when you try to pick up this one here, of
###485 course it doesn't work at all.
###487 And this one here, absolutely no problem at all.
###490 It's fun to do with a friend, you're the magician and your
###493 friend can't do it and you can do it.
###495 And the secret of course, is friction
###498 with Leonardo da Vinci.
###501 Now here's the problem.
###503 When you go to pull this one out here, it's a little harder
###505 to pull out.
###505 You will want to put your fingers here and pull a little
###507 bit so it looks natural.
###509 There's more rice in this one than this one.
###511 So when you go to dump it, as you're talking, begin to pour
###514 this one first.
###515 So you can say, all I used was regular rice, watch.
###518 And now it begins to pour because I had that little bit
###521 a head start.
###522 When they flow, they should both kind of fall out, you
###525 hope, as you are shaking them out exactly the same.
###528 Bingo, and you've got it.
###530 Not a bad way to do it.
###532 The other secret, believe it or not is the
###533 shape of the bottle.
###534 You need to have a bottle where the neck
###536 comes up like this.
###538 In doing so when you push this down, it actually allows the
###541 rice to push up against that neck and create the friction
###544 that you need to pick up the bottle.
###546 If you use another container like this, even though there's
###548 a lot of rice packed in there.
###549 No matter what you do, it won't pick up the container.
###552 [DOOR CLOSING]
###554 Well for this trick you're using unpopped popcorn and a
###558 steel ball bearing.
###561 All right, watch this.
###562 The ball bearing goes into the corn and most people don't
###564 realize that corn and the ball bearing have this chemical
###568 reaction here.
###569 Watch this, I'll spin it around, watch.
###572 And you'll see that magically, it turns
###576 into a ping pong ball.
###579 It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this out.
###581 Look at the secret, it's there.
###583 Here's the ball bearing.
###584 This is a density demonstration.
###587 So watch, the little ball hides under the
###590 surface, like this.
###593 Now nobody knows that it's there, it's perfect.
###594 So now if you take the ball bearing, and you drop the ball
###597 bearing in, this eventually, as you start moving it around
###600 will sink down.
###601 And believe it or not, the corn will help push the ping
###604 pong ball up so as you are holding it here like this,
###606 here watch.
###608 Ta da.
###611 So if you're teaching science, what does this teach?
###614 Basically nothing.
###615 I don't know, you can tie it into density if you wanted to.
###617 I think it's a cool trick.
###620 Ah.
###622 Well for this little gem you are going to need to have some
###623 table salt.
###624 And where to you get the table salt?
###625 From your friend's mom's house.
###627 While you are there, get yourself her credit card
###629 because you're going to need to also
###630 get a baby soda bottle.
###631 Where do you baby soda bottle?
###633 A website called
###634 stevespanglerscience.com [BEEP]
###637 I've been asked to remove that one offensive part.
###640 Forget the friends get the salt from your own house.
###643 
###646 So this is more of a puzzle than a magic trick
###648 but it is very cool.
###648 So you fill this little test tube.
###650 You can use anything that's like this, but this test tube
###652 works really, really well.
###654 You fill it up with salt, like this.
###656 Then you take an ordinary marble and drop it in.
###660 And now you put the cap on top like this.
###662 That's why we like to use these
###663 little baby soda bottles.
###664 And now the object is this, is to ask a friend, again a
###667 puzzle, to move that little marble from one end to the
###671 other end as fast as they can.
###672 And they're going to try to shake it like this.
###674 And they are going to try to move it down here like this.
###676 It really is tough to move it down, especially if there's
###679 some time involved with it.
###681 It'll take them forever.
###681 If you're a baby sitter, this is perfect.
###683 It'll keep the kid busy for hours.
###685 And if you're ever babysitting for Higgensworth,
###686 it'll take him days.
###689 Ta da.
###690 That only took me about 10 minutes.
###693 There's an easier way to move that little marble from one
###696 end to the other.
###696 And the secret is this.
###697 If you turn the whole thing upside down, so see it's at
###699 the bottom.
###699 If you want to move into the top, here's
###701 what you have to do.
###701 You have to send everything up into the air and when you do
###704 that, the salt will work its way underneath the marble and
###708 literally begin to push the marble to the very top.
###710 So you have this motion of up and down and let it fall down.
###713 And there it is.
###714 So in a matter of seconds, it's at the top.
###718 This is a perfect technique for getting the toy surprise
###720 out of your cereal.
###723 You know how they put the toy surprise in there?
###725 It's never at the top where you want it.
###726 And you have to get your hand in here and
###728 you have to dig around.
###728 And you've got dirty hands, [SNOT BLOW], then all of a
###730 sudden nobody wants your cereal.
###732 So here's how you get the toy surprise to the top.
###735 You go like this, and you shake it up like this.
###738 So if you give it a shake, now that toy surprise will slowly
###743 work its way to the top.
###745 Ta da.
###746 It's at the top.
###747 Who put this in here?
###748 That's not funny.
###752 [DOOR CLOSING]
###753 All right, now let's do a real magic trick.
###755 This is very, very cool.
###756 It uses two glass bottles.
###759 These were, I don't know, water bottles or something.
###761 And two pieces of rope.
###762 So examine them, make sure they're OK.
###764 They should be absolutely the same.
###768 OK?
###769 So here's what we're going to do.
###769 I want you to pick one of the bottles, left or right?
###774 Bingo.
###775 Pick one of the pieces of rope, it doesn't matter.
###777 Got it, all right.
###778 This is called do as I do.
###781 So what you're going to do is you're going to ask him to put
###783 the rope inside the bottle.
###784 Higgins, put the rope inside the bottle.
###786 Do as I do, like this.
###787 BRYAN HIGGENS: OK.
###788 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, put it in.
###789 Hold it in your hand like this.
###791 And now turn it upside-- hold it like this-- turn it upside
###794 down and cause the rope to float in the bottle.
###797 Ha, ha, ha, ha.
###800 No it's because I have a magic spell on mine, so watch.
###803 You take the rope like this.
###804 BRYAN HIGGENS: OK.
###804 STEVE SPANGLER: And put it in here like this, got it?
###807 Good and now turn it upside down.
###811 And it floats.
###814 And then you take it like this and the
###815 bottle floats like this.
###818 So when you put yours inside like this,
###820 it'll float like that.
###821 And when you want to release the spell, then it's gone.
###824 See how that works?
###825 So I could put this in here like this, you
###827 turn it upside down.
###827 You go wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.
###828 There's actually a genie inside the bottle and then the
###831 genie holds onto the rope.
###833 It hangs onto it like this.
###834 And you can release the little genie down inside by pushing
###837 the rope down in here and wiggling.
###838 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.
###839 And the genie comes out.
###840 See how it works?
###841 You probably think it's--
###842 BRYAN HIGGENS: There's no genie in mine.
###843 STEVE SPANGLER: See, maybe you need a different bottle.
###845 So here, take my bottle.
###846 Take my rope.
###847 I'll take your robe.
###847 I'll take your bottle.
###848 Watch this.
###849 Take the piece of rope, put it down inside, turn the whole
###851 thing upside down.
###853 Let go, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.
###854 See it stays here like this.
###855 Turn it upside down.
###856 And it floats like magic.
###859 And that's how you do a special little trick called
###862 the prayer vase.
###864 Did you get it Higgens?
###865 BRYAN HIGGENS: No, not yet.
###867 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, go and let it go, it'll be perfect.
###869 This is actually an IQ test so if you can do it on the first
###873 try, you're pretty smart.
###874 And if you do this, really smart.
###876 So here's, believe it or not the secret.
###880 A little bit of aluminum foil.
###882 All right, you're not going to need much, you are going to
###884 tear off a little square of aluminum foil like this.
###888 And what we need is we need something that will hook onto
###892 the rope inside.
###893 So what I want you to do is fold it up like
###895 this and make a ball.
###896 So you're going to want to squeeze this down so that it
###899 very easily falls right into the bottle.
###902 The original ones from the magic shop would use a little
###904 piece of cork that somebody had worked on.
###907 I think the aluminum foil works perfectly.
###909 And you can keep on working it and it will fall into the
###911 bottle with no problem at all.
###914 Here's what's great about this bottle.
###915 I happened to find it.
###916 It's this blue which I thought was cool.
###918 I took some black spray paint and actually shot it inside
###921 the bottle here so that you can't see
###923 through the neck here.
###924 You can see a little bit through here which is great,
###927 but you can't see through the neck.
###928 So when you drop this down inside you can't-- nobody
###931 really sees, it's on the bottom and when it's trapped
###933 there in the little neck, nobody can see it at all.
###936 But so you can see what's going on, let's trade out for
###938 a clear bottle.
###939 At the very beginning I had the little piece of aluminum
###943 foil in my finger like this.
###944 So it's called a finger palm, or a clip.
###947 So it's being held here in my hand.
###948 And you turn your hand over and it looks fairly natural.
###951 Now if you sit here and you're worried about, then everybody
###953 going to know that it's in your hand.
###954 But you're not.
###954 Here's a piece of rope and here are the bottles.
###957 And pretend like we had these two bottles, that's fine, OK?
###959 But I'm going to show you how it works with it.
###961 So the little ball goes down inside and now
###964 we're ready to go.
###965 I'll show you about how to load it in here in a second,
###967 but I want to show you how it works.
###969 First of all you take the piece of rope and the rope
###971 goes down inside.
###971 When you turn it upside down, look at what happens.
###973 The little ball gets lodged between the rope and the side
###977 of the bottle.
###978 So now we've set up some fraction that's here.
###980 Pull and you can see.
###981 So when you let go nobody can see this because again, that
###984 neck is black.
###985 So you can't see it.
###986 And now when you turn it upside down, the rope hangs
###989 which is beautiful.
###990 Now to release it, all you have to do is put your hand
###992 here like this.
###992 And when you put your hand on it, it the rope down enough to
###995 be able to release the ball.
###996 I can easily release this and I can do
###998 the whole thing again.
###999 And if they ever it to say there's something in the
###1002 bottle you simply turn it upside down and draw attention
###1005 to something on the bottom.
###1006 All that's really doing is loading that ball back into
###1008 your fingers like this.
###1009 You pull it back out and you hand them the bottle.
###1012 You take this bottle here and you say see, mine's the same.
###1014 I loaded it back in and now I'm ready to go once again.
###1017 It's tricky.
###1019 All right, so let's see if my student can do it.
###1021 Ready, hold it in your finger like that, you got it?
###1022 Turn it upside down, load it in, perfect.
###1024 Turn it back over, perfect.
###1026 Nobody hears.
###1027 Now this goes in here like this, turn it upside down.
###1030 Wiggle, there's a little genie inside, do you have it?
###1033 Ah.
###1033 Bingo.
###1034 And now take and swing it.
###1036 [SWOOSH]
###1038 You, see you are amazing.
###1040 All right, so now put it back down again.
###1042 Push it down a little bit because that will release it,
###1044 so you're going to have to do it here close.
###1045 So release it, good job.
###1047 Pull it back out again and you've done it.
###1048 BRYAN HIGGENS: Awesome.
###1049 STEVE SPANGLER: That's awesome.
###1051 And now you know the science of things that float.
###1054 You did a good job.
###1055 Now if you get this and the rope thing in the
###1058 handkerchief or--
###1059 you could do kid's birthday parties.
###1060 You could put it all in a little tub.
###1062 BRYAN HIGGENS: That's true.
###1063 STEVE SPANGLER: My boys are having a
###1064 birthday party next Saturday.
###1065 BRYAN HIGGENS: Why didn't I see this coming?
###1066 STEVE SPANGLER: And you should put it all there because the
###1068 kids would love to see you there.
###1070 You could maybe make a little extra money.
###1072 Not from me of course, but if you did a good job on mine,
###1074 there might be some neighbors that would want you to come.
###1077 BRYAN HIGGENS: All right.
###1078 STEVE SPANGLER: Maybe some YouTube viewers would like you
###1079 to come their house too.
###1081 BRYAN HIGGENS: I'll let you know Steve.
###1081 STEVE SPANGLER: I think you should do that.
###1082 And then you're not going to let me know, I need you there
###1084 at the house.
###1084 So it's next-- if you take out your phone, all right, write
###1087 this date down, OK?
###1088 BRYAN HIGGENS: All right.
###1089 STEVE SPANGLER: It's next week, it's next Saturday.
###1090 If you come a half an hour early, we got to get the
###1092 backyard set up so.
###1095 So that would be perfect.
###1096 Press Save, save.
###1097 Good.
###1098 So if I were, I'd get practicing.
###1101 You are going to do a good job.
###1102 My kids are going to love you.
###1103 And if they're bad, we're going to shut this circus down
###1106 like they were bad at the last magician, but they've learned.
###1109 OK?
###1109 You'll going to do great.
###1110 My kids are going to love you
###1111 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1134 STEVE SPANGLER: If I were to ask this what this is, you
###1137 would probably say a pitcher full of milk.
###1138 But what it really is is evaporated milk.
###1142 Let me show you what I mean.
###1144 I'll pour the milk into the cone and all it takes for the
###1151 milk to evaporate is my magic wand.
###1153 
###1158 [LAUGHTER]
###1159 Evaporation is complete.
###1160 MALE SPEAKER: For heaven's sake.
###1162 How did you do that?
###1164 STEVE SPANGLER: Very well.
###1164 [LAUGHTER]
###1166 MALE SPEAKER: Just like his father is what he is.
###1169
