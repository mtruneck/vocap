But I'm not really interested
in a picture.


6

There's a difference between

8
0:0:25,16 --> 0:0:28,88
And I wanted to make pictures
about something.

16
0:1:24,696 --> 0:1:28,21
A friend of mine sent
me an email.


17
0:1:28,21 --> 0:1:30,34
And it was a really
dark email.


18
0:1:30,34 --> 0:1:33,1
And I was kind of in a dark
place then, a few weeks ago.


19
0:1:33,1 --> 0:1:34,7
Things were not good.


20
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:36,52
I picked up my phone.


21
0:1:36,52 --> 0:1:39,71
And it said, it looks like
our terrible world


22
0:1:39,71 --> 0:1:41,1
is revealing itself.

0:1:41,1 --> 0:1:42,95
And then I started reading it.

0:1:42,95 --> 0:1:43,23
And I'm like, holy shit.


25
0:1:43,23 --> 0:1:45,9
This is hugely significant.


26
0:1:45,9 --> 0:1:49,2
So there was definitely a
compelling urge to do this.


27
0:1:49,2 --> 0:1:51,968
And I thought, if I do not go
do this, I should just leave

0:2:14,8 --> 0:2:18,98
When I was about 14 years old,
my dad bought me a camera.


31
0:2:18,98 --> 0:2:20,63
It was a Yashica.


32
0:2:20,63 --> 0:2:24,4
I'm not sure why he got me the
camera, maybe as a birthday


33
0:2:24,4 --> 0:2:25,46
present or something.


34
0:2:25,46 --> 0:2:26,33
I don't really remember.


35
0:2:26,33 --> 0:2:29,54
But I do remember that I
loved it when I first


36
0:2:29,54 --> 0:2:31,1
grabbed that camera.


37
0:2:31,1 --> 0:2:34,55
At the same time, I think
magazines were probably in


38
0:2:34,55 --> 0:2:35,43
their peak.


39
0:2:35,43 --> 0:2:37,73
I mean, everybody talks about
a golden age of magazines.


40
0:2:37,73 --> 0:2:40,6
But for me, it was really the
late '80s, early '90s.


41
0:2:40,6 --> 0:2:43,35
And as a kid, my family, they
subscribed to "Time,"


42
0:2:43,35 --> 0:2:45,45
"Newsweek," all the usual
news weeklies.


43
0:2:45,45 --> 0:2:48,16
And I remember opening up, and
these big huge photographs.


44
0:2:48,16 --> 0:2:50,18
And that was the first
time where it


45
0:2:50,18 --> 0:2:51,97
started connecting events.


46
0:2:51,97 --> 0:2:55,9
This idea of history being
created or made, and then the


47
0:2:55,9 --> 0:2:57,2
idea that somebody actually
has to go out there and


48
0:2:57,2 --> 0:2:59,54
discuss what this history is.


49
0:2:59,54 --> 0:3:0,36
I started working.


50
0:3:0,36 --> 0:3:3,33
I got a summer job at a tabloid,
the "Toronto Sun." I


51
0:3:3,33 --> 0:3:4,5
worked there for four months.


52
0:3:4,5 --> 0:3:8,5
All my friends were kind of
turning their noses, oh, how


53
0:3:8,5 --> 0:3:10,59
could you work "The Sun?" You
know, it's a tabloid.


54
0:3:10,59 --> 0:3:12,5
But it was the best--
one of the greatest


55
0:3:12,5 --> 0:3:13,18
experiences of my life.


56
0:3:13,18 --> 0:3:14,3
It was four months.


57
0:3:14,3 --> 0:3:16,18
I had never, ever, ever,
made any money


58
0:3:16,18 --> 0:3:17,36
of photography before.


59
0:3:17,36 --> 0:3:19,17
And this idea of getting
paid for it was really


60
0:3:19,17 --> 0:3:20,26
exhilarating.


61
0:3:20,26 --> 0:3:24,21
And then I kind of had this
brainstorm that, wow, there


62
0:3:24,21 --> 0:3:26,44
are other newspapers and
magazines in the world.


63
0:3:26,44 --> 0:3:29,9
And I ended up working a lot for
"The New York Times," and


64
0:3:29,9 --> 0:3:33,24
for some German publications,
which was great.


65
0:3:33,24 --> 0:3:36,2
So at first, when I started at
"The Globe," it was Toronto


66
0:3:36,2 --> 0:3:37,57
and sort of area.


67
0:3:37,57 --> 0:3:40,34
And then as I got more
experience and more clients,


68
0:3:40,34 --> 0:3:42,205
it was all across the country.


69
0:3:42,205 --> 0:3:47,51



70
0:3:47,51 --> 0:3:51,39
My interest in Russia
begins, I guess--


71
0:3:51,39 --> 0:3:52,78
yeah, I was 12 years old.


72
0:3:52,78 --> 0:3:53,595
Because I had pneumonia.


73
0:3:53,595 --> 0:3:56,19
I was bed-ridden for
three, four months.


74
0:3:56,19 --> 0:3:58,11
The only thing I could do
was listen to the radio.


75
0:3:58,11 --> 0:4:1,36
And I remember early May
of '86 lying in my bed.


76
0:4:1,36 --> 0:4:4,14
And there was a news report that
came on about this place


77
0:4:4,14 --> 0:4:7,5
called Chernobyl and a massive
nuclear accident.


78
0:4:7,5 --> 0:4:10,4
So since then, I got kind
of fascinated, I guess.


79
0:4:10,4 --> 0:4:13,12
And I had met some police
officers in a small town.


80
0:4:13,12 --> 0:4:15,44
And I had met, like--


81
0:4:15,44 --> 0:4:17,22
I don't want to them
Mafia guys--


82
0:4:17,22 --> 0:4:19,66
ex-mobsters, but still
criminals.


83
0:4:19,66 --> 0:4:21,95
This was a very focused
project.


84
0:4:21,95 --> 0:4:23,4
I went out with the cops.


85
0:4:23,4 --> 0:4:24,44
And they were doing
their raids.


86
0:4:24,44 --> 0:4:26,5
And I would hang out with
the criminals and such.


87
0:4:26,5 --> 0:4:29,25
And at that time, then the work
kind of split off into


88
0:4:29,25 --> 0:4:30,44
two tangents.


89
0:4:30,44 --> 0:4:33,41
One was this idea of power and
the acquisition of power.


90
0:4:33,41 --> 0:4:36,5
But then also, out of my,
again, trying to save my


91
0:4:36,5 --> 0:4:39,6
childhood curiosity,
was Chernobyl.


92
0:4:39,6 --> 0:4:41,41
Everybody thinks Chernobyl is
three-headed babies, and


93
0:4:41,41 --> 0:4:44,71
monsters, and mutant catfish,
and such like that.


94
0:4:44,71 --> 0:4:47,28
And when I got up there, I was
really pleasantly surprised


95
0:4:47,28 --> 0:4:51,36
that it had completely smashed
any expectation that I had.


96
0:4:51,36 --> 0:4:53,845
And that's when I knew, that OK,
I've got to come back and


97
0:4:53,845 --> 0:4:55,28
photograph Chernobyl.


98
0:4:55,28 --> 0:4:59,19
There was a man I met named
Nikolai who said, oh, come


99
0:4:59,19 --> 0:5:1,27
into my home, and
we drink vodka.


100
0:5:1,27 --> 0:5:5,6
And it was one of my first
sort of experiences in a


101
0:5:5,6 --> 0:5:8,36
traditional Ukrainian village.


102
0:5:8,36 --> 0:5:10,59
And the whole custom of meeting
somebody and being


103
0:5:10,59 --> 0:5:12,63
invited to the house.


104
0:5:12,63 --> 0:5:15,635
And his friend Victor came over,
Victor Popovichenko, who


105
0:5:15,635 --> 0:5:18,45
I ended up photographing
a few months later.


106
0:5:18,45 --> 0:5:22,32
And that photograph I guess was
my key moment where things


107
0:5:22,32 --> 0:5:23,2
changed for me.


108
0:5:23,2 --> 0:5:24,15
I had one of--


109
0:5:24,15 --> 0:5:26,635
well, press for that, he's
falling over, trying to catch


110
0:5:26,635 --> 0:5:28,19
his vodka and stuff.


111
0:5:28,19 --> 0:5:31,49
And that was when the
seed was planted.


112
0:5:31,49 --> 0:5:32,93
OK, I'm going to Chernobyl.


113
0:5:32,93 --> 0:5:35,38
But I wanted to Chernobyl in
winter, so I waited about


114
0:5:35,38 --> 0:5:36,13
eight, nine months.


115
0:5:36,13 --> 0:5:40,42
And I went back for three months
in the winter of 2006.


116
0:5:40,42 --> 0:5:43,5
And I had lived up in Chernobyl,
close to the zone.


117
0:5:43,5 --> 0:5:45,13
And I just spent all
my time up there


118
0:5:45,13 --> 0:5:46,71
photographing that project.


119
0:5:46,71 --> 0:5:49,39
Since then, I just have
kept going back.


120
0:5:49,39 --> 0:5:52,4
Well I've been into the zone
probably 15, 20 times, but


121
0:5:52,4 --> 0:5:55,16
I've probably been to the
Chernobyl region itself, I


122
0:5:55,16 --> 0:5:57,26
don't know, 30 times or
something like that.


123
0:5:57,26 --> 0:6:0,99
It's just something that
I kind of love now.


124
0:6:0,99 --> 0:6:3,74
I always tell my friends I want
to get a second home.


125
0:6:3,74 --> 0:6:4,68
And it's going to
be in Chernobyl.


126
0:6:4,68 --> 0:6:7,9
It's quite beautiful,
actually.


127
0:6:7,9 --> 0:6:10,6
This is one of my first projects
where I started


128
0:6:10,6 --> 0:6:12,9
questioning the way I work, and
what I'm working on, and


129
0:6:12,9 --> 0:6:14,6
why I'm working on it.


130
0:6:14,6 --> 0:6:16,48
What kind of photography
do I want to do?


131
0:6:16,48 --> 0:6:19,7
And that's what Russia kind
of allowed me to do.


132
0:6:19,7 --> 0:6:20,94
I'm trying to explore
different ways


133
0:6:20,94 --> 0:6:22,95
to talk about this--


134
0:6:22,95 --> 0:6:25,64
an atomic world that we've
decided to live in.


135
0:6:25,64 --> 0:6:30,38
So when Japan happened, and
Fukushima especially, I


136
0:6:30,38 --> 0:6:33,3
thought, I have to go.


137
0:6:33,3 --> 0:6:35,49
Because it's almost
mirroring what's


138
0:6:35,49 --> 0:6:36,89
happened with Chernobyl.


139
0:6:36,89 --> 0:6:40,19
That is why I'm sitting
here in Japan now.


140
0:6:40,19 --> 0:6:42,9
Which is a place that I kind
of wanted to come to.


141
0:6:42,9 --> 0:6:46,89
But I never really thought I
would end up here so quickly.


142
0:6:46,89 --> 0:6:49,51
But obviously, with what's been
happening in the last


143
0:6:49,51 --> 0:6:52,58
three weeks with Fukushima and
the nuclear reactor, I just


144
0:6:52,58 --> 0:6:54,79
felt that OK, I need to go.


145
0:6:54,79 --> 0:6:58,798
And I see Tokyo now as the
city of the archetypal,


146
0:6:58,798 --> 0:7:0,22
apocalyptic city.


147
0:7:0,22 --> 0:7:2,17
It's the perfect place
for the world to end.


148
0:7:2,17 --> 0:7:11,2



149
0:7:11,2 --> 0:7:12,75
The first thing I did
notice was about the


150
0:7:12,75 --> 0:7:14,81
lights, that it is dark.


151
0:7:14,81 --> 0:7:16,46
And this idea of the
electricity.


152
0:7:16,46 --> 0:7:19,52
And then, of course, the reason
the electricity is at,


153
0:7:19,52 --> 0:7:22,5
I think, what did they say, 60%
capacity, is because of


154
0:7:22,5 --> 0:7:24,78
what's happening with Fukushima,
which is the main


155
0:7:24,78 --> 0:7:27,47
power source for Tokyo.


156
0:7:27,47 --> 0:7:31,4
So Tokyo relies upon what's
happening in Fukushima.


157
0:7:31,4 --> 0:7:34,68
And what's happening Fukushima
is not helping the


158
0:7:34,68 --> 0:7:36,38
situation in Tokyo.


159
0:7:36,38 --> 0:7:38,95
When I told people and said,
I'm going to Japan and I'm


160
0:7:38,95 --> 0:7:42,2
going to do a story about the
exclusion zone and what's


161
0:7:42,2 --> 0:7:44,5
happening there, I just knew.


162
0:7:44,5 --> 0:7:47,44
I knew what I was going to find
because I had had that


163
0:7:47,44 --> 0:7:48,925
experience in Chernobyl
and Zholtye Vody.


164
0:7:48,925 --> 0:7:51,44
And I kind of know about these


165
0:7:51,44 --> 0:7:54,1
wastelands which are forgotten.


166
0:7:54,1 --> 0:7:56,85
And it actually did meet
every expectation.


167
0:7:56,85 --> 0:7:59,13
But it also completely
spooked me.


168
0:7:59,13 --> 0:8:7,44



169
0:8:7,44 --> 0:8:10,63
You start seeing the actual
destruction of the earthquake


170
0:8:10,63 --> 0:8:11,61
and the tsunami.


171
0:8:11,61 --> 0:8:13,29
I mean, that's the really
interesting thing about


172
0:8:13,29 --> 0:8:17,25
Fukushima, I think, is it wasn't
just an earthquake.


173
0:8:17,25 --> 0:8:18,31
It wasn't just a tsunami.


174
0:8:18,31 --> 0:8:21,65
But now on top it, on a third
layer, they've got this


175
0:8:21,65 --> 0:8:23,42
nuclear catastrophe.


176
0:8:23,42 --> 0:8:25,89
That was the other weird thing
is that there was no police,


177
0:8:25,89 --> 0:8:27,82
no Japanese defense forces.


178
0:8:27,82 --> 0:8:31,8
In Minamisoma, they had the
city hall building.


179
0:8:31,8 --> 0:8:35,86
There was people there testing
for radiation.


180
0:8:35,86 --> 0:8:38,86
And the only military that
was there was the


181
0:8:38,86 --> 0:8:40,285
guy parking the cars.


182
0:8:40,285 --> 0:8:46,86



183
0:8:46,86 --> 0:8:49,18
It was actually a pretty
normal city.


184
0:8:49,18 --> 0:8:51,21
I was writing an email
to my friend.


185
0:8:51,21 --> 0:8:54,43
I said, picture your
neighborhood in Toronto.


186
0:8:54,43 --> 0:8:58,61
And I just said-- called you
right now, leave right now.


187
0:8:58,61 --> 0:9:1,36
Run.


188
0:9:1,36 --> 0:9:3,56
How did you leave
your apartment?


189
0:9:3,56 --> 0:9:4,82
Is your television set on?


190
0:9:4,82 --> 0:9:6,25
Were you eating dinner?


191
0:9:6,25 --> 0:9:7,75
What we're doing?


192
0:9:7,75 --> 0:9:11,61
And that's exactly what I sensed
in Odaka, that people


193
0:9:11,61 --> 0:9:13,46
just suddenly left.


194
0:9:13,46 --> 0:9:16,73
Windows open, the curtains
blowing in the breeze.


195
0:9:16,73 --> 0:9:19,7
Going into people's homes,
especially that one home with


196
0:9:19,7 --> 0:9:22,69
the bowl of oranges just sitting
on the table and such.


197
0:9:22,69 --> 0:9:25,51
If people are really planning
to never come back to their


198
0:9:25,51 --> 0:9:28,1
home, I think they're going to
take that bowl of oranges and


199
0:9:28,1 --> 0:9:31,14
probably throw them out, or
put it away, or clean out


200
0:9:31,14 --> 0:9:32,99
their fridge, or something
like that.


201
0:9:32,99 --> 0:9:35,14
I think if you're given a week
to leave your home, you're


202
0:9:35,14 --> 0:9:39,33
going to make your home in
a state that is never


203
0:9:39,33 --> 0:9:41,36
returnable.


204
0:9:41,36 --> 0:9:42,81
Complete annihilation.


205
0:9:42,81 --> 0:9:44,28
Just this, shoo.


206
0:9:44,28 --> 0:9:47,33
Like somebody took a chessboard
and just through


207
0:9:47,33 --> 0:9:49,22
all the pieces aside.


208
0:9:49,22 --> 0:9:54,6
And the silence and the
stillness was something that


209
0:9:54,6 --> 0:9:55,18
I've only ever heard
in Chernobyl.


210
0:9:55,18 --> 0:9:56,685
So I've only heard
that two times.


211
0:9:56,685 --> 0:10:0,3



212
0:10:0,3 --> 0:10:3,1
I just really think we we're
the only people--


213
0:10:3,1 --> 0:10:5,49
no, I know we were the only
people to tell that story.


214
0:10:5,49 --> 0:10:9,0
To go to exclusion zone and
to actually see what


215
0:10:9,0 --> 0:10:10,8
the reality is there.


216
0:10:10,8 --> 0:10:13,93
And ironically enough, I had
read a report yesterday on CNN


217
0:10:13,93 --> 0:10:17,26
saying there are bodies, yes,
there are bodies still in the


218
0:10:17,26 --> 0:10:18,57
exclusion zone.


219
0:10:18,57 --> 0:10:21,4
But the bodies that are left
are ones we can't get to


220
0:10:21,4 --> 0:10:23,1
because they're inside.


221
0:10:23,1 --> 0:10:24,27
And it's a radioactive thing.


222
0:10:24,27 --> 0:10:24,89
But we've cleaned.


223
0:10:24,89 --> 0:10:26,86
There are no bodies
on the streets.


224
0:10:26,86 --> 0:10:30,6
And we had specifically
seen a body in Odaka.


225
0:10:30,6 --> 0:10:32,91
And if we've seen one, there's
definitely more.


226
0:10:32,91 --> 0:10:36,18
Because it was pretty much, not
in plain sight, but all


227
0:10:36,18 --> 0:10:39,98
you had to do was walk 30
seconds off the main street,


228
0:10:39,98 --> 0:10:41,23
and there was a body.


229
0:10:41,23 --> 0:10:46,49



230
0:10:46,49 --> 0:10:47,74
Wow.

237
0:11:9,138 --> 0:11:18,55



238
0:11:18,55 --> 0:11:21,59
I've always had an understanding
of who I am as a


239
0:11:21,59 --> 0:11:23,48
photographer, what I'm
trying to say.


240
0:11:23,48 --> 0:11:28,54
And I've always seen my
career as a body.


241
0:11:28,54 --> 0:11:29,3
Everything--


242
0:11:29,3 --> 0:11:32,37
it might take me 20 years to
finally tell the entire


243
0:11:32,37 --> 0:11:34,44
project that I want to tell.


244
0:11:34,44 --> 0:11:37,89
I mean, I always try to be
consistent with my work and


245
0:11:37,89 --> 0:11:41,16
develop it, but also
maintain its basic


246
0:11:41,16 --> 0:11:42,53
structure, its premise.


247
0:11:42,53 --> 0:11:45,32
And then that's going back to
our statement about what a


248
0:11:45,32 --> 0:11:46,26
novelist does.


249
0:11:46,26 --> 0:11:49,66
You really have to look at a
nuance and subtlety, and maybe


250
0:11:49,66 --> 0:11:53,23
use allegory or a metaphor
to get across a story.


251
0:11:53,23 --> 0:11:59,5



252
0:11:59,5 --> 0:12:1,7
You know, you see people on the
street, please give money.


253
0:12:1,7 --> 0:12:4,1
Or if you want to help the
tsunami relief, this is what


254
0:12:4,1 --> 0:12:5,3
you can do.


255
0:12:5,3 --> 0:12:9,21
But I have an idea, a feeling
that people just don't really


256
0:12:9,21 --> 0:12:10,51
understand.


257
0:12:10,51 --> 0:12:14,79
They're not grasping the whole
scope of the potentiality.


258
0:12:14,79 --> 0:12:17,15
I think with the earthquake
and tsunami, yeah it was a


259
0:12:17,15 --> 0:12:17,61
catastrophe.


260
0:12:17,61 --> 0:12:20,18
But you know, it's an
engineering catastrophe.


261
0:12:20,18 --> 0:12:21,24
We can fix this.


262
0:12:21,24 --> 0:12:23,54
But you can't fix what's
happening in Fukushima.
