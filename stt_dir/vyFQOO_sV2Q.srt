CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Oh-ho, man, that was
awesome. Thanks to everyone at Oresman (ph)


9
0:0:35,19 --> 0:0:37,809
Middle for getting things going today with
that I- Report.


10
0:0:37,809 --> 0:0:42,5
From your mock debate, we are going to jump
right into the presidential debate.


11
0:0:42,5 --> 0:0:46,929
Last night was the third and final face-off
between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. This


12
0:0:46,929 --> 0:0:51,82
debate was held at Lynn University in Boca
Raton, Florida, and it focused on foreign


13
0:0:51,82 --> 0:0:55,649
policy. So we are talking about ways in which
the United States interacts with the rest


14
0:0:55,649 --> 0:1:0,899
of the world. Election day is exactly two
weeks away. Candidates will still be out at


15
0:1:0,899 --> 0:1:5,82
events on the campaign trail. But last night
was the last chance they had to present some


16
0:1:5,82 --> 0:1:11,46
of their ideas to a large audience all at
once. Here is some of what happened.


17
0:1:11,46 --> 0:1:21,62
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


18
0:1:21,62 --> 0:1:26,94
MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
I absolutely believe that America has a responsibility


19
0:1:26,94 --> 0:1:32,98
and the privilege of helping defend freedom
and promote the principles that make the world


20
0:1:32,98 --> 0:1:39,53
more peaceful, and those principles include
human rights, human dignity, free enterprise,


21
0:1:39,53 --> 0:1:44,54
freedom of expression, elections because when
there are elections people tend to vote for


22
0:1:44,54 --> 0:1:49,81
peace. They don`t vote for war. So we want
to promote those principles around the world.


23
0:1:49,81 --> 0:1:54,73
We recognize that there are places of conflict
in the world. We want to end those conflicts


24
0:1:54,73 --> 0:2:0,6
to the extend humanly possible. But in order
to be able to fulfill our role in the world,


25
0:2:0,6 --> 0:2:1,23
America must be strong.


26
0:2:1,23 --> 0:2:4,11
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: America remains the one indispensable


27
0:2:4,11 --> 0:2:11,11
nation and the world needs a strong America
and it is stronger now than when I came into


28
0:2:11,11 --> 0:2:17,17
office. Because we ended the war in Iraq we
were able to refocus our attention on not


29
0:2:17,17 --> 0:2:22,93
only the terrorist threat, but also beginning
a transition process in Afghanistan. It also


30
0:2:22,93 --> 0:2:29,959
allowed us to refocus on alliances, relationships
that have been neglected for a decade. And


31
0:2:29,959 --> 0:2:37,67
Governor Romney, our alliances have never
been stronger. In Asia, in Europe, in Africa,


32
0:2:37,67 --> 0:2:43,81
with Israel where we have unprecedented military
and intelligence cooperation, including dealing


33
0:2:43,81 --> 0:2:44,889
with the Iranian threat.


34
0:2:44,889 --> 0:2:45,489
(END VIDEOTAPE)


35
0:2:45,489 --> 0:2:49,98
AZUZ: One of the topics that came up during
last night debate was outsourcing. It`s when


36
0:2:49,98 --> 0:2:54,87
a company has a different business do some
kind of work. So, instead of doing it themselves,


37
0:2:54,87 --> 0:2:59,379
companies pay someone else to do it. Outsourcing
can help companies save money and maybe help


38
0:2:59,379 --> 0:3:4,689
keep cost down on the products that they sell.
But if U.S company outsources work to a different


39
0:3:4,689 --> 0:3:9,249
country, it means those jobs aren`t being
done by American workers. Maggie Lake has


40
0:3:9,249 --> 0:3:13,379
more on the impact of outsourcing and the
presidential candidates` plans to do something


41
0:3:13,379 --> 0:3:13,879
about it.


42
0:3:13,879 --> 0:3:14,279
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


43
0:3:14,279 --> 0:3:15,69
MITT ROMNEY: Thank you.


44
0:3:15,69 --> 0:3:15,859
PAUL RYAN: Thank you.


45
0:3:15,859 --> 0:3:18,49
MAGGIE LAKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Whether on
the campaign trail ...


46
0:3:18,49 --> 0:3:22,69
ROMNEY: If there is an outsourcer-in-chief,
it`s the president of the United States.


47
0:3:22,69 --> 0:3:24,889
LAKE: Or amid the barrage of 
political ads on TV.


48
0:3:24,889 --> 0:3:29,45
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mitt Romney`s firms were
pioneers at helping companies outsource their


49
0:3:29,45 --> 0:3:32,79
manufacturing to countries including China.


50
0:3:32,79 --> 0:3:39,239
LAKE: Outsourcing is a hot button issue again
in presidential politics. In states like Ohio,


51
0:3:39,239 --> 0:3:44,249
Pennsylvania and Michigan where scores of
factory jobs have been lost, it is a deeply


52
0:3:44,249 --> 0:3:45,26
emotional issue.


53
0:3:45,26 --> 0:3:49,739
JOE KLEIN, TIME MAGAZINE: They do a lot of
focus grouping, and polling and testing. And


54
0:3:49,739 --> 0:3:51,73
what they find is, that this is very resonant.


55
0:3:51,73 --> 0:3:56,999
LAKE: In recent years, the manufacturing sector
of the U.S. has been hit particularly hard.


56
0:3:56,999 --> 0:4:3,62
Over five and a half million jobs lost between
2000 and 2009. A million alone to China. But


57
0:4:3,62 --> 0:4:7,819
that tide maybe turning as companies rethink
their commitment to lower wage countries.


58
0:4:7,819 --> 0:4:11,12
HAL SIRKIN, BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP: Wages
in China are, you know, topping $3 an hour.


59
0:4:11,12 --> 0:4:16,419
Wages will probably be something around $6
an hour or so in 2015. It starts to become


60
0:4:16,419 --> 0:4:20,9
competitive with the U.S., you have the intellectual
property risk, and being far away from (ph)


61
0:4:20,9 --> 0:4:22,65
consumer means you are not on top of the trends.


62
0:4:22,65 --> 0:4:26,72
LAKE: General Electric and Caterpillar are
just a few of the companies who have recently


63
0:4:26,72 --> 0:4:31,62
brought some of their production back to the
U.S. Economists warn the manufacturing revival


64
0:4:31,62 --> 0:4:37,129
has a long way to go, but both candidates
are pledging they can get the job done.


65
0:4:37,129 --> 0:4:41,729
Mitt Romney continues to call for lower taxes
for businesses, just for investment. And tougher


66
0:4:41,729 --> 0:4:43,97
trade relations with China.


67
0:4:43,97 --> 0:4:48,72
President Obama is also calling for tax incentives
for companies that bring jobs back to the


68
0:4:48,72 --> 0:4:54,569
U.S. and touting the auto industry bailout
which Romney opposed. Maggie Lake, CNN, New York.

0:4:54,569 --> 0:4:55,3
(END VIDEOTAPE)


70
0:4:55,3 --> 0:5:0,36
AZUZ: All right, next stop: Lance Armstrong.
He won cycling`s most famous race, seven times


71
0:5:0,36 --> 0:5:6,16
in a row, but you can`t call him a Tour de
France champion anymore. Yesterday, the International


72
0:5:6,16 --> 0:5:13,24
Cycling Union said it was wiping out Armstrong`s
titles and banning him from the sport.


73
0:5:13,24 --> 0:5:17,53
This was in response to a report from the
U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. It says there is


74
0:5:17,53 --> 0:5:22,159
overwhelming evidence that Armstrong used
banned performance enhancing drugs during


75
0:5:22,159 --> 0:5:27,68
his career. Armstrong has always denied that.
In addition to losing his Tour de France titles,


76
0:5:27,68 --> 0:5:33,36
Armstrong is being asked to return nearly
$4 million that he won for those seven Tour


77
0:5:33,36 --> 0:5:34,15
victories.


78
0:5:34,15 --> 0:5:39,5
Cheerleaders, they`ve got spirit? Yes, they
do. But they do a lot more than just chant


79
0:5:39,5 --> 0:5:46,0
and clap and try to get the home crows excited.
We are talking about pyramids, flips, tosses.


80
0:5:46,0 --> 0:5:50,39
Cheerleading involves some pretty serious
acrobatic stance, and that`s got some doctors


81
0:5:50,39 --> 0:5:55,289
concerned about some pretty serious injuries.
The American Academy of Pediatrics just put


82
0:5:55,289 --> 0:5:59,86
out a new policy on cheerleading injuries.
The group says that injury rate in cheerleading


83
0:5:59,86 --> 0:6:5,72
is low compared to other sports, but the number
of catastrophic injuries, like brain and spinal


84
0:6:5,72 --> 0:6:11,69
cord injuries in cheering is going up. The
new policy suggests that cheerleaders limit


85
0:6:11,69 --> 0:6:15,34
their stance and avoid doing them on hard
surfaces, and that they should be checked


86
0:6:15,34 --> 0:6:17,93
for concussions if they have a head injury.

Club at South Middle School in Lawrence, Kansas.
"Which of these positions is the leader of


90
0:6:29,139 --> 0:6:37,229
a marching band? Here we go, is it: the field
marshal, drill instructor, drum major or concertmaster?


91
0:6:37,229 --> 0:6:42,479
You`ve got three seconds, go!


92
0:6:42,479 --> 0:6:51,22
A marching band is led by its drum major.
That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."

AZUZ: At the University of Missouri, the drum
major leads a marching band of more than 300


95
0:6:57,659 --> 0:7:2,379
members. It`s one of the largest college marching
bands in the country. Now, its current head


96
0:7:2,379 --> 0:7:7,49
drum major says he wanted the job so that
people could look up to him in difficult times,


97
0:7:7,49 --> 0:7:12,77
but he wasn`t just talking about the marching
band. Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains what we mean.

DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As a
drum major for marching Missou (ph), the University


100
0:7:24,59 --> 0:7:28,86
of Missouri`s famed marching band, Paul Heddings
is living his dream.


101
0:7:28,86 --> 0:7:34,65
It`s a new dream, because his original dream
of playing professional baseball was disappearing.


102
0:7:34,65 --> 0:7:40,349
PAUL HEDDINGS, UNIV. OF MISSOURI DRUM MAJOR:
September Seventh, 2007, just (inaudible)


103
0:7:40,349 --> 0:7:41,65
my junior high school ...


104
0:7:41,65 --> 0:7:45,8
GUPTA: The 17-year old woke up, and his world
was changing.


105
0:7:45,8 --> 0:7:48,259
HEDDINGS: Everything was just a little blurry,
it didn`t seem like anything was wrong.


106
0:7:48,259 --> 0:7:54,159
GUPTA: But something was terribly wrong. His
retinas had detached and started to tear apart


107
0:7:54,159 --> 0:7:54,969
in both eyes.


108
0:7:54,969 --> 0:7:58,65
HEDDINGS: I didn`t know how my life would
change, what I`d be able to do, what I wouldn`t


109
0:7:58,65 --> 0:8:1,62
be able to do. I could potentially go completely
blind ...


110
0:8:1,62 --> 0:8:6,389
GUPTA: Paul says this was not caused by disease
or trauma, but by genetics.


111
0:8:6,389 --> 0:8:10,379
HEDDINGS: This has happened to my mom, my
grandma and a couple of uncles. Even my little


112
0:8:10,379 --> 0:8:12,6
sister is having some more issues.


113
0:8:12,6 --> 0:8:17,77
GUPTA: They didn`t lose much vision. Paul,
on the other hand, is now legally blind. Sight


114
0:8:17,77 --> 0:8:24,639
in his best eye can`t be corrected beyond
2200. He says family, friends and music saved


115
0:8:24,639 --> 0:8:31,259
his life. He joined his high school drum line,
taking the music home, magnifying it, memorizing


116
0:8:31,259 --> 0:8:31,55
it.


117
0:8:31,55 --> 0:8:33,31
HEDDINGS: Here we go, be flat!


118
0:8:33,31 --> 0:8:39,13
I just, you know, strapped up my boots and
went to work.


119
0:8:39,13 --> 0:8:43,57
GUPTA: He made the Missou (ph) drum line first
playing cymbals and then after an extensive


120
0:8:43,57 --> 0:8:52,31
interview process clinched the coveted drum
major spot. Most in the band didn`t even know


121
0:8:52,31 --> 0:8:54,95
he was legally blind.


122
0:8:54,95 --> 0:8:59,19
Heddings hopes his time on the letter will
change the perception of visually impaired


123
0:8:59,19 --> 0:8:59,57
people.


124
0:8:59,57 --> 0:9:5,56
HEDDINGS: I want to be able to say when I
leave here that I did something special, and


125
0:9:5,56 --> 0:9:7,779
that I didn`t let this hold me back.

costume for a dog? Come on, that`s too easy.


130
0:9:24,48 --> 0:9:28,75
Hello, if he falls behind on the parade, he`ll
have to catch-up. It may seem out of the ordinary


131
0:9:28,75 --> 0:9:33,47
to see a dog dressed up like a former first
lady of Argentina, but it`s just a sign of


132
0:9:33,47 --> 0:9:37,779
the season. After all, we are right around
the corner from Halloween. We`ve reached the
