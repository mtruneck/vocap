###23 JAN KWIECINSKI: I wanted to create a clash of two
###24 margins-- the people from the city and the people from
###27 outside the city.
###28 I was thinking that showing these fancy guys from the town
###32 who get lost somewhere and people in the village who are
###37 also lost can be a nice idea.

###49 JAN KWIECINSKI: One thing was the margins, and the other
###51 thing was the unknown place, which the audience had never
###54 seen before.
###55 And I was thinking that maybe that a cool idea would be if I
###58 would go to place where I have never been before.
###60 So that's what I did.

###93 JAN KWIECINSKI: What is great about Parysewo is that when I
###95 first came here, it was totally empty.
###98 Basically, there was nobody on the street.
###101 It was very mysterious.
###102 Because you look at this amazing big church, but it's
###107 untouched in a way.
###108 There are 100-year-old houses, and you feel that you don't
###114 have this life outside.
###115 It feels like it's the middle of nowhere.
###117 I felt a quite strange atmosphere here.
###121 I don't know what it is.
###122 Logistically, like from my point of view, it's quite easy
###125 to close the town and to shoot the empty town.
###128 And I was thinking that maybe it wouldn't be such a stupid
###132 idea to put some characters there.

###151 JAN KWIECINSKI: My script was based basically on very
###153 logical structure.
###155 I tried to write as few details as possible because of
###160 the fact that I want my actors to feel creative and to be a
###165 part of the storytelling.
###166 And in my opinion, it's always good to open these kind of
###170 doors to the actors because they straightaway feel like a
###174 participant of the project.
###176 And they are becoming very creative straightaway.

###204 JAN KWIECINSKI: It's the first time when I'm working with
###205 four actors.
###206 I was really lucky because they knew each other before
###209 they met in my project.
###211 I felt there was an energy which is coming straight from
###214 nothing in a way.
###215 I felt from the beginning of the project that these are the
###219 kind of actors which will make these characters feel alive.
###224 PAWEL TOMASZEWSKI: [SPEAKING POLISH]

###234 JAN KWIECINSKI: I got a good group in here.
###236 And sometimes the director who really wants to direct can
###240 kill the project.
###241 A very, very important part of the
###244 process is keeping distance.
###246 And what's helps you in keeping distance is constantly
###249 sharing this idea with the others.
###251 Don't think that only your way is the good way because that
###255 can make the project look really like without life.
###258 And this way of thinking about the script, I think it's not
###261 only connected with thinking how should you work with the
###264 actors, but also how should you work with other people who
###268 are participating in movie projects.
###270 And I try to not make it my script but
###272 their script as well.
###274 RADOSLAWA BARDES: Say hello.
###276 Hello, little puppy.
###279 She's terrified.
###280 She peed on me, like, twice already.
###283 We want to show that the town got abandoned by locals, and
###287 these dogs are homeless, and they just hang around.
###290 We make sure that we have bag of kielbasa, polish sausages.
###294 And we just bribe them.
###295 If they come with us, they start their career.
###298 
###301 JAN KWIECINSKI: I really feel so overwhelmed that I'm the
###305 participant of this project.
###307 And I really feel like this so great opportunity to me.
###312 And it's really hard to talk about it.
###314 Everything was so fast.
###315 And the whole process is like I didn't even
###319 notice where it started.
###321 It wasn't clear at all.
###324 You gave us this super opportunity to talk about
###329 something so metaphysical that you can't even talk about it.
###333 So this is the four dimension of my movie, trying to capture
###336 something beyond our perception, something more
###340 than we can imagine.
###341 So from the beginning, I was thinking, create the story
###346 between this magical and real world.
###349 But the magic has to be created from the realism which
###352 you are making.
###354 And maybe we'll find four dimensions in the end.
###357 I hope so.
