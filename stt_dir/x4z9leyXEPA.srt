1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,43



2
0:0:3,43 --> 0:0:6,26
SIMON OSTROVSKY: The Israeli
military has organized a


3
0:0:6,26 --> 0:0:9,26
little briefing to show off
their new missile defense


4
0:0:9,26 --> 0:0:11,57
system called the Iron Dome.


5
0:0:11,57 --> 0:0:14,19
And the commander has actually
come here to tell the


6
0:0:14,19 --> 0:0:17,22
international press about
their brand new toy.


7
0:0:17,22 --> 0:0:18,47
So we're going to
check it out.


8
0:0:18,47 --> 0:0:26,1



9
0:0:26,1 --> 0:0:42,745



10
0:0:42,745 --> 0:0:45,52
SIMON OSTROVSKY: This latest
war with Gaza was the first


11
0:0:45,52 --> 0:0:48,63
time Iron Dome had been deployed
against an onslaught


12
0:0:48,63 --> 0:0:49,89
of this kind.


13
0:0:49,89 --> 0:0:52,92
Israel and the United States
decided to fund it for almost


14
0:0:52,92 --> 0:0:56,57
a billion dollars each after
the 2006 conflict with


15
0:0:56,57 --> 0:0:58,21
Hezbollah in Lebanon.


16
0:0:58,21 --> 0:1:2,78
That war saw 4,000 similarly
crude rockets kill 44 people


17
0:1:2,78 --> 0:1:4,14
in northern Israel.


18
0:1:4,14 --> 0:1:7,15
With casualties low, public
pressure on Israeli


19
0:1:7,15 --> 0:1:10,1
politicians to retaliate
was weak, too.


20
0:1:10,1 --> 0:1:12,85
It made me wonder if targeting
Hamas was a military


21
0:1:12,85 --> 0:1:14,9
necessity at all.


22
0:1:14,9 --> 0:1:17,66
Do you think it's less necessary
for Israel to strike


23
0:1:17,66 --> 0:1:20,52
in the Gaza Strip as it has
been, now that people here are


24
0:1:20,52 --> 0:1:22,985
protected by your very
successful Iron Dome system?


25
0:1:22,985 --> 0:1:27,89



26
0:1:27,89 --> 0:1:30,46
-Thank you very much.


27
0:1:30,46 --> 0:1:32,4
SIMON OSTROVSKY: My question
was answered by the Israeli


28
0:1:32,4 --> 0:1:35,4
Air Force instead, which
launched a strike on the Gaza


29
0:1:35,4 --> 0:1:38,37
media center at about the same
time our press conference was


30
0:1:38,37 --> 0:1:42,7
being held, killing a top leader
in the Islamic Jihad.


31
0:1:42,7 --> 0:1:44,52
So was all of this carnage
necessary?


32
0:1:44,52 --> 0:1:46,1
Could it have been avoided?


33
0:1:46,1 --> 0:1:48,54
I met an Israeli who thought
it could have been.


34
0:1:48,54 --> 0:1:51,58
Gershon Baskin is the man who
had negotiated with Ahmed


35
0:1:51,58 --> 0:1:54,41
Jabari for the release
of Gilad Shalit.


36
0:1:54,41 --> 0:1:57,72
He told me that the day Jabari
was killed, he was supposed to


37
0:1:57,72 --> 0:2:1,6
have given an answer about a
ceasefire proposal Baskin had


38
0:2:1,6 --> 0:2:2,58
put forward.


39
0:2:2,58 --> 0:2:5,1
If you're able to negotiate
with Hamas, how come this


40
0:2:5,1 --> 0:2:8,49
time, negotiations weren't
able to head off this new


41
0:2:8,49 --> 0:2:9,254
round of violence?


42
0:2:9,254 --> 0:2:11,95
GERSHON BASKIN: The day that it
happened, Jabari had seen


43
0:2:11,95 --> 0:2:14,7
the proposal for an extended
ceasefire.


44
0:2:14,7 --> 0:2:17,55
It was for a three to month
trial period that involved not


45
0:2:17,55 --> 0:2:20,99
only stopping fire but taking
preventive action on their


46
0:2:20,99 --> 0:2:23,99
side against groups that would
try to attack Israel.


47
0:2:23,99 --> 0:2:27,35
Every time over the past two
years we've gotten involved in


48
0:2:27,35 --> 0:2:29,77
helping to negotiate a
ceasefire, at the end of the


49
0:2:29,77 --> 0:2:33,66
day it was Jabari who went and
sent his forces out to impose


50
0:2:33,66 --> 0:2:34,94
the ceasefire.


51
0:2:34,94 --> 0:2:38,26
So there was more than a good
indication that he would have


52
0:2:38,26 --> 0:2:40,76
supported a three to six
month trial period.


53
0:2:40,76 --> 0:2:43,71
The prevailing wisdom amongst
the Israeli military and


54
0:2:43,71 --> 0:2:46,34
security forces is that what
we needed to do, more than


55
0:2:46,34 --> 0:2:48,9
anything else, was to
create deterrence.


56
0:2:48,9 --> 0:2:51,9
Make them so scared of what
we will do that they


57
0:2:51,9 --> 0:2:52,78
won't shoot at us.


58
0:2:52,78 --> 0:2:56,14
The decision to take out Ahmed
Jabari was very clear.


59
0:2:56,14 --> 0:2:57,75
This guy's the head
of the pyramid.


60
0:2:57,75 --> 0:3:1,39
If we could get him, there's
no one who has impunity.


61
0:3:1,39 --> 0:3:4,7
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yet, you're an
Israeli who doesn't support


62
0:3:4,7 --> 0:3:7,12
the fact that Ahmed Jabari
was assassinated.


63
0:3:7,12 --> 0:3:9,95
GERSHON BASKIN: What I'm saying
is that you use force


64
0:3:9,95 --> 0:3:13,3
as the very, very,
very last option.


65
0:3:13,3 --> 0:3:16,2
You try and exhaust every
other possibility


66
0:3:16,2 --> 0:3:17,5
before you use force.


67
0:3:17,5 --> 0:3:21,32
And I believe that there was
at least one more option to


68
0:3:21,32 --> 0:3:23,37
try before going to war.


69
0:3:23,37 --> 0:3:26,6
Israeli officials knew about the
attempts of the ceasefire


70
0:3:26,6 --> 0:3:27,36
that we were trying
to develop.


71
0:3:27,36 --> 0:3:29,637
They were well aware, and
they didn't try it.


72
0:3:29,637 --> 0:3:34,607



73
0:3:34,607 --> 0:3:37,13
SIMON OSTROVSKY: We're in
Rishon Lezion, a town in


74
0:3:37,13 --> 0:3:38,33
central Israel.


75
0:3:38,33 --> 0:3:42,61
And this building was hit by a
rocket fired by Hamas about an


76
0:3:42,61 --> 0:3:44,55
hour and a half ago.


77
0:3:44,55 --> 0:3:47,47
We're almost 60 kilometers away
from the border with the


78
0:3:47,47 --> 0:3:48,61
Gaza Strip.


79
0:3:48,61 --> 0:3:52,36
Hamas are trying to show the
Israelis that they can hit the


80
0:3:52,36 --> 0:3:54,45
country right in its center.


81
0:3:54,45 --> 0:3:57,54
This part of the country hasn't
been hit for 20 years.


82
0:3:57,54 --> 0:4:0,85
And this has kind of been a
wake up call for Israel.


83
0:4:0,85 --> 0:4:22,1



84
0:4:22,1 --> 0:4:23,31
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They destroyed


85
0:4:23,31 --> 0:4:25,55
your house, your home.


86
0:4:25,55 --> 0:4:27,94
SIMON OSTROVSKY: What do you
want your country to do now?


87
0:4:27,94 --> 0:4:35,62



88
0:4:35,62 --> 0:4:38,44
SIMON OSTROVSKY: The next day,
we heard that a bomb exploded


89
0:4:38,44 --> 0:4:40,45
on a bus in Tel Aviv.


90
0:4:40,45 --> 0:4:43,22
Officials didn't yet know if
Hamas had planted it, but


91
0:4:43,22 --> 0:4:45,22
there were already reports
of injuries.


92
0:4:45,22 --> 0:4:47,5
The conflict had entered
a new phase.


93
0:4:47,5 --> 0:4:50,61
It wasn't just rockets coming
out of Gaza anymore.


94
0:4:50,61 --> 0:4:52,65
There were now bombs being
placed on public


95
0:4:52,65 --> 0:4:54,13
transportation.


96
0:4:54,13 --> 0:4:56,16
We headed south,
back to Gaza in


97
0:4:56,16 --> 0:4:58,52
anticipation of Israel's reaction.


98
0:4:58,52 --> 0:5:1,1
It was the eighth day
of open hostilities.


99
0:5:1,1 --> 0:5:4,5
And Israel's troops weren't
showing any sign of getting


100
0:5:4,5 --> 0:5:5,16
ready to go.


101
0:5:5,16 --> 0:5:5,85
[GUNSHOT]


102
0:5:5,85 --> 0:5:6,7
Jesus.


103
0:5:6,7 --> 0:5:10,8
Fuck.


104
0:5:10,8 --> 0:5:12,64
SIMON OSTROVSKY: No filming?


105
0:5:12,64 --> 0:5:13,89
OK, sorry.


106
0:5:13,89 --> 0:5:18,7



107
0:5:18,7 --> 0:5:19,28
SIMON OSTROVSKY: And there
seems to be some


108
0:5:19,28 --> 0:5:21,52
rocket fire coming in.


109
0:5:21,52 --> 0:5:23,96
Because we've heard a couple
of explosions just now.


110
0:5:23,96 --> 0:5:27,71
There's a really big troop build
up just behind these


111
0:5:27,71 --> 0:5:29,49
trees over here.


112
0:5:29,49 --> 0:5:31,36
And we're only about a couple
of kilometers away.


113
0:5:31,36 --> 0:5:31,781
So--


114
0:5:31,781 --> 0:5:32,623
[GUNSHOT]


115
0:5:32,623 --> 0:5:33,89
Fuck.


116
0:5:33,89 --> 0:5:35,82
Jesus Christ.


117
0:5:35,82 --> 0:5:39,6
Meanwhile in Egypt, mediators
had finally gotten Israel and


118
0:5:39,6 --> 0:5:40,77
Hamas to agree to a ceasefire.


119
0:5:40,77 --> 0:5:47,27



120
0:5:47,27 --> 0:5:49,64
So it's only a couple of minutes
left until 9:00 when


121
0:5:49,64 --> 0:5:53,79
the ceasefire is supposed
to come into effect.


122
0:5:53,79 --> 0:5:57,13
So far, we've seen rockets
coming into Gaza, and


123
0:5:57,13 --> 0:5:58,98
exploding rockets coming
out of Gaza.


124
0:5:58,98 --> 0:6:0,74
When the rockets have been
coming in, these guys here


125
0:6:0,74 --> 0:6:1,52
have been cheering.


126
0:6:1,52 --> 0:6:2,68
They are not happy,


127
0:6:2,68 --> 0:6:4,83
apparently, about the ceasefire.


128
0:6:4,83 --> 0:6:7,86
Because they want to see Israel
flatten Hamas in the


129
0:6:7,86 --> 0:6:9,27
Gaza Strip.


130
0:6:9,27 --> 0:6:12,82
But so far, it doesn't feel like
the ceasefire is actually


131
0:6:12,82 --> 0:6:13,71
coming into effect.


132
0:6:13,71 --> 0:6:15,65
But we'll give it a couple
more minutes.


133
0:6:15,65 --> 0:6:17,8
See what happens.


134
0:6:17,8 --> 0:6:19,49
[SPEAKING HEBREW]


135
0:6:19,49 --> 0:6:25,97



136
0:6:25,97 --> 0:6:27,22
[SPEAKING HEBREW]


137
0:6:27,22 --> 0:6:34,1



138
0:6:34,1 --> 0:6:35,925
[SPEAKING HEBREW]


139
0:6:35,925 --> 0:6:41,22



140
0:6:41,22 --> 0:6:44,71
SIMON OSTROVSKY: And then
everything went quiet.


141
0:6:44,71 --> 0:6:47,4
That is, aside from the
celebratory gunfire in the


142
0:6:47,4 --> 0:6:51,49
Gaza Strip and the muezzins
calling from the mosques.


143
0:6:51,49 --> 0:6:55,38
10 minutes, and you can hear
soldiers in the field between


144
0:6:55,38 --> 0:7:0,15
here and Gaza cheering
about it.


145
0:7:0,15 --> 0:7:2,78
Haven't heard any
rockets explode.


146
0:7:2,78 --> 0:7:4,88
Haven't heard anything come
in or go out of Gaza.


147
0:7:4,88 --> 0:7:8,4
So I guess this one's over.


148
0:7:8,4 --> 0:7:10,97
And we'll see you in a
couple of years when


149
0:7:10,97 --> 0:7:13,43
the next round happens.


150
0:7:13,43 --> 0:9:13,43
