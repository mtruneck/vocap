1
0:0:3,81 --> 0:0:15,459
And no one to manage the land.


2
0:0:15,459 --> 0:0:18,119
Spanish explorers invade the Americas


3
0:0:18,119 --> 0:0:20,72
and bring with them the horse.


4
0:0:20,72 --> 0:0:22,66
First brought to the Caribbean islands,


5
0:0:22,66 --> 0:0:25,699
these animals reproduce and spread in the new world


6
0:0:25,699 --> 0:0:31,3
as fast as the wind.


7
0:0:31,3 --> 0:0:36,9
Horses have not been seen here since the Ice Age.


8
0:0:36,9 --> 0:0:41,68
Now they're back.


9
0:0:41,68 --> 0:0:51,44
It's as though the landscape has been waiting for them.


10
0:0:51,44 --> 0:0:54,96
Once ashore a few horses run wild.


11
0:0:54,96 --> 0:0:56,84
A new breed evolves,


12
0:0:56,84 --> 0:1:7,73
which soon takes over North America: the Mustang.


13
0:1:7,73 --> 0:1:16,63
Within three hundred years they had reached the central plains and the Rocky Mountains.


14
0:1:16,63 --> 0:1:18,439
At the end of the eighteenth century


15
0:1:18,439 --> 0:1:26,42
the Mustang makes it as far as Canada.


16
0:1:26,42 --> 0:1:28,6
One hundred and fifty years later


17
0:1:28,6 --> 0:1:56,95
there may be seven million wild horses in North America.


18
0:1:56,95 --> 0:1:59,75
For the nomadic tribes like the Black Foot Cheyenne,


19
0:1:59,75 --> 0:2:2,43
Sioux and Comanche of the central plains


20
0:2:2,43 --> 0:2:10,949
these wild horses are a blessing.


21
0:2:10,949 --> 0:2:12,56
What they used to do on foot


22
0:2:12,56 --> 0:2:14,839
fighting, hunting, travelling,


23
0:2:14,839 --> 0:2:20,929
they can now do on the backs of wild horses from Europe.


24
0:2:20,929 --> 0:2:34,189
It transforms their lives.


25
0:2:34,189 --> 0:2:37,798
This old world animal becomes the symbol of their native culture.


26
0:2:37,798 --> 0:3:3,349
Although the horse once came from across the Atlantic, it is now an image of nomadic America.


27
0:3:3,349 --> 0:3:7,19
As soon as the conquistadors have conquered South and Central America


28
0:3:7,19 --> 0:3:14,779
one of them heads north:


29
0:3:14,779 --> 0:3:16,409
Fernando de Soto


30
0:3:16,409 --> 0:3:21,179
travels from Florida up the Mississippi river.


31
0:3:21,179 --> 0:3:34,369
Looking for gold.


32
0:3:34,369 --> 0:3:37,899
The Spaniards leave death in their wake.


33
0:3:37,899 --> 0:3:56,49
And something else they bring along to keep them alive.


34
0:3:56,49 --> 0:3:58,329
As they journey through unknown jungles,


35
0:3:58,329 --> 0:4:3,89
the pigs help them survive.


36
0:4:3,89 --> 0:4:8,559
They are a perfect source of food.


37
0:4:8,559 --> 0:4:11,759
They don't take up much space in the boats.


38
0:4:11,759 --> 0:4:13,309
They look after themselves


39
0:4:13,309 --> 0:4:17,589
and they eat everything they can in this new continent.


40
0:4:17,589 --> 0:4:19,739
They're prolific little beasts.


41
0:4:19,739 --> 0:4:24,36
A healthy sow can give birth to ten piglets at a time.


42
0:4:24,36 --> 0:4:26,83
When the conquistadors leave some behind


43
0:4:26,83 --> 0:4:31,32
they will have an ever growing food supply for those who come after them.


44
0:4:31,32 --> 0:4:39,669
The pigs are key to their survival.


45
0:4:39,669 --> 0:4:41,43
But to native Americans


46
0:4:41,43 --> 0:4:47,989
they're a curse.


47
0:4:47,989 --> 0:4:50,69
In North America natives do not fence their fields


48
0:4:50,69 --> 0:5:2,55
and the staple crop of corn is irresistible.


49
0:5:2,55 --> 0:5:18,96
There is no evidence that native Americans know how to fight this plague of pigs.


50
0:5:18,96 --> 0:5:32,499
Soon European swine are eating the seeds and the young shoots.


51
0:5:32,499 --> 0:5:34,949
Only a few generations after running wild


52
0:5:34,949 --> 0:5:40,279
the animal becomes very different from the typical farm pig.


53
0:5:40,279 --> 0:5:44,13
It grows tusks and gets bigger and aggressive.


54
0:5:44,13 --> 0:5:45,97
What began with a few pigs


55
0:5:45,97 --> 0:5:56,18
becomes a daily nightmare for the native Americans.


56
0:5:56,18 --> 0:5:57,71
In addition to horses


57
0:5:57,71 --> 0:6:1,619
Columbus brought eight pigs to America on his second voyage.


58
0:6:1,619 --> 0:6:3,229
Within twenty years


59
0:6:3,229 --> 0:6:8,32
there are thirty thousand pigs on the island of Cuba alone.


60
0:6:8,32 --> 0:6:18,55
They multiply conquering the Andes, the Amazon and North America.


61
0:6:18,55 --> 0:6:21,479
But the Spaniard, his horse and his pig


62
0:6:21,479 --> 0:6:25,359
would never have been so successful in the conquest of the new world


63
0:6:25,359 --> 0:6:32,4
without a hidden passenger.


64
0:6:32,4 --> 0:6:40,61
It is when the old and new worlds touch that the native American meets his worst enemy.


65
0:6:40,61 --> 0:6:56,0
A very black ** for the continent.


66
0:6:56,0 --> 0:6:59,339
A Spanish missionary reports:


67
0:6:59,339 --> 0:7:3,169
"An epidemic broke up, a sickness of pustules


68
0:7:3,169 --> 0:7:5,969
large blobs spread on people.


69
0:7:5,969 --> 0:7:8,29
Some were entirely covered


70
0:7:8,29 --> 0:7:11,309
on the face, the head, the chest


71
0:7:11,309 --> 0:7:17,85
they lay in their dwellings and sleeping places no longer able to move or stir.


72
0:7:17,85 --> 0:7:20,729
The pustules caused great desolation,


73
0:7:20,729 --> 0:7:26,15
very many people died of them and many starved to death.


74
0:7:26,15 --> 0:7:34,659
No one's took care of others any longer.


75
0:7:34,659 --> 0:7:46,289
Deadly diseases contaminate both continents of the Americas.


76
0:7:46,289 --> 0:7:47,46
For the natives


77
0:7:47,46 --> 0:7:49,8
writes a chronicler.


78
0:7:49,8 --> 0:7:52,21
they are near all dead at the smallpox.


79
0:7:52,21 --> 0:8:3,809
so the Lord have cleared our title to what we possess."


80
0:8:3,809 --> 0:8:4,75
To this day


81
0:8:4,75 --> 0:8:11,119
scientists are still working to identify these diseases,


82
0:8:11,119 --> 0:8:14,419
to trace their paths


83
0:8:14,419 --> 0:8:22,99
and count the dead.


84
0:8:22,99 --> 0:8:26,289
Smallpox was accidentally introduced in the Americas in the sixteenth-century.


85
0:8:26,289 --> 0:8:30,969
The smallpox virus is very hearty. In blankets that are used by smallpox victims


86
0:8:30,969 --> 0:8:32,75
the scabs can live


87
0:8:32,75 --> 0:8:37,74
for weeks carrying the virus and smallpox can also pass from host to host


88
0:8:37,74 --> 0:8:42,4
on board a trans-atlantic vessel until it reaches the Americas. And of course


89
0:8:42,4 --> 0:8:46,68
once smallpox reached the Americas it was introduced to millions of new hosts,


90
0:8:46,68 --> 0:8:51,32
human hosts who had no acquired immunities to these diseases.


91
0:8:51,32 --> 0:8:56,15
And so smallpox together with measles and influenza had a devastating impact


92
0:8:56,15 --> 0:8:58,49
on native American populations.


93
0:8:58,49 --> 0:9:4,51
No one knows exactly what the mortality was. Conservative estimates are about 50%.


94
0:9:4,51 --> 0:9:8,85
It was probably closer to ninety percent or even higher.


95
0:9:8,85 --> 0:9:11,129
Through trade between native peoples


96
0:9:11,129 --> 0:9:14,57
diseases spread through the whole continent.


97
0:9:14,57 --> 0:9:20,65
Many natives die from diseases without ever seeing a European.


98
0:9:20,65 --> 0:9:27,74
Microbes move faster than the conquistadors who brought them.


99
0:9:27,74 --> 0:9:32,5
Some fifty years after Columbus first sets foot in the Americas


100
0:9:32,5 --> 0:9:37,94
conquistadors and explorers find neither towns nor people.


101
0:9:37,94 --> 0:9:40,69
No one stands in their way.


102
0:9:40,69 --> 0:9:42,99
Most of the people are dead


103
0:9:42,99 --> 0:9:45,84
and Nature reclaims the land.


104
0:9:45,84 --> 0:9:50,13
Everything that they now find is pure wilderness.


105
0:9:50,13 --> 0:9:59,3
A garden of Eden, without humans.


106
0:9:59,3 --> 0:10:3,66
A thousand different kinds of birds and beasts of the forests


107
0:10:3,66 --> 0:10:5,18
which have never been known


108
0:10:5,18 --> 0:10:10,77
neither in shape or name.


109
0:10:10,77 --> 0:10:13,31
"And ** there is no mention made


110
0:10:13,31 --> 0:10:19,45
neither among the latins or greeks or any other nations of the world".


111
0:10:19,45 --> 0:10:24,77
reports a Spanish missionary.


112
0:10:24,77 --> 0:10:46,47
It may be God has made a new creation of beasts".


113
0:10:46,47 --> 0:10:52,756
Explorers send exotic plants and animals, evidence of God's second creation


114
0:10:52,756 --> 0:11:4,62
on the ships back to Spain.


115
0:11:4,62 --> 0:11:5,439
Corn


116
0:11:5,439 --> 0:11:9,79
Chilean pumpkins,


117
0:11:9,79 --> 0:11:12,6
domesticated in the new world


118
0:11:12,6 --> 0:11:15,41
unknown in Europe.


119
0:11:15,41 --> 0:11:27,23
Tomatoes and potatoes.


120
0:11:27,23 --> 0:11:31,4
But there is an unwelcome passenger on board.


121
0:11:31,4 --> 0:11:36,24
An unintentional gift from the natives.


122
0:11:36,24 --> 0:11:40,49
It will lead to death in Europe.


123
0:11:40,49 --> 0:11:46,21
It was spread in the brothels, in the courts and cities of the old world.


124
0:11:46,21 --> 0:11:49,46
It will be painful.


125
0:11:49,46 --> 0:11:54,59
It drives its victims mad.


126
0:11:54,59 --> 0:12:2,61
And it can take a long long time to kill.


127
0:12:2,61 --> 0:12:4,79
This is the French pox,


128
0:12:4,79 --> 0:12:9,57
or the Spanish sickness,


129
0:12:9,57 --> 0:12:17,64
syphilis.


130
0:12:17,64 --> 0:12:20,28
Europeans have no idea


131
0:12:20,28 --> 0:12:23,15
that this disease came from America,


132
0:12:23,15 --> 0:12:30,67
where more and more are aching to go.


133
0:12:30,67 --> 0:12:37,89
In the seventeenth century a new wave of people heads to the new world: the settlers.


134
0:12:37,89 --> 0:12:43,5
England has defeated Spain to become a new European superpower.


135
0:12:43,5 --> 0:12:54,73
The English crown sets out to claim its share.


136
0:12:54,73 --> 0:12:58,51
In 1607 the British start a colony on the east coast of


137
0:12:58,51 --> 0:13:9,72
North America, in what is now Virginia.


138
0:13:9,72 --> 0:13:21,15
They name it Jamestown after their king.


139
0:13:21,15 --> 0:15:21,15
This will become
