###1 Jacque Fresco - Dec. 19, 2010 "Relation to Academia" www.thevenusproject.com ãƒ» Part 3
###7 How many Catholics, whether they're the Lutheran, or Presbyterian Church, they get their point of view.
###14 To go feel which one is closest. Some do, I don't doubt that.
###18 There are many religious people that go to different Churches and stop at the one nearest to their values.
###25 That's what all people do. And if they all pick primitive things, your culture needs an overhaul.
###32 If we still go to war, you know. I think in the motion picture "Things to come" - somebody said to Dr. Cabal
###42 or the guy in charge that they're at war - "Still at it, eh?"
###47 See, there were some comments which normal people did not react to in the film, at all.
###56 They couldn't react to it. They have no background to react to it. They found a bunch of scientists running things
###64 and it just didn't look right. They'd look like - the answer was H.G. Well's friend said "it sounds like fascism."
###72 Now this system would sound like fascism. Cause Fresco lays out the schools, the buildings, the cities.
###79 Only because not enough people are into that yet. But there will be more people laying it out as they get into it.
###87 Edison taught people how to use the electric light. How to build generators. Or people that made generators
###94 for Edison taught people to make generators.
###97 But the average person did not get it up and say "I don't want any generators, they're not god-given."
###103 There were some people that said that. They'd never use generators - they're out of business.
###110 So - presenting idea's is not the answer. Preparing people's attitude to be able to hear new idea's -
###118 so when they listen to you, they say "I don't know enough about the subject to make a decision; I think
###124 I'll going back and read up on it, and come back next week. Very few people do that.
###132 Sure, you'll find evidence among some academicians to support some of the concepts.
###138 But not enough. I hate to use academicians, cause they climb up on the back of innovators.
###146 But I do understand reliance on academicians to help support the project. But that isn't real.
###155 I think people had to learn from the Wright Brothers - "How to build airplanes."
###161 If they built the first flying machine, the army said - the army was the first to order 5 airplanes from
###168 the Wright Brothers for surveillance. They attempted - "War tank is better for shooting", airplanes could only
###176 carry a rifle. Before that, they threw bottles, and stones at one another in the air. Did you know that?
###183 In the old days? Cause the airplane couldn't carry a cannon, it could only carry a rifle.
###190 The guy would stand up from cover, and try to shoot the other plane down. And then they had a gun way above the
###197 wing, so that it would clear the propeller. Then somebody invented a synchronous machine gun that
###204 shoots between the rotation of the blades. Did you know what I'm talking about? You don't?
###209 There's a bump on the camshaft. You know what that means? The camshaft turns the propellor -
###215 and that bump operates the machine gun [imitates machine gun] between where the blade is.
###221 Otherwise, they shot off the propeller. Do you understand that? So, its the invention of the machine gun
###228 at the pilots eye view that enabled him to shoot down more planes. When the guns are on top, its only
###235 an approximation. Do you understand? They're on the top wing, above the height of the propeller, or out
###243 on the wings, which didn't give you a good view.
###249 So, invention compensates for human insufficiency.
###256 But we have a lot of inventors making things that are useless too.
###262 A house should be a public library, a school, intercommunications systems, not just a home;
###270 with a laptop, the house is becoming more than just a place to sleep and eat. In the future, it'll be
###277 a place with your built-in gym, and everything else, if you can afford it. Or, if the society can make a house -
###285 the better-integrated people aren't interconnected to a richer society.
###290 People say "Will everybody be uniform?"
###293 If they were technically uniform it would be useful; non-technically it would not be useful.
###300 There's nothing the matter with uniformity. All architects, and all engineers have to pass a standard exam
###308 which is okay, for competence, you know. But if you know of technicians that advocate aspects of
###316 The Venus Project, great. Technicians eventually will do that. But remember - they bring with them some
###325 of the primordial slime. Cause they don't come from an environment that's objective, or scientific, yet.
###334 A scientific world is in the early phases of the scientific method. Academia is not The Venus Project.
###345 Nor is it science - as its used today. They wouldn't work on bombers if they were part of The Venus Project.
###353 They wouldn't work on weapons. They wouldn't be patriotic if there was such a thing as a science.
###360 I'm sure there are, I'm sure they're having a tough time, too.
###366 I'm sure there's some scientist must come to some conclusion similar, but not all join together.
###373 Its very rare for someone to have the identical environment I had. Very rare. No, they don't come to
###381 the same conclusion. Most scientists believe in free will.
###387 I asked them. Don't forget, I've met a lot of scientists. "Do you believe in free will?" - "Of course.
###394 I scored high in my school." - That means something else, it means that they have a different environment.
###403 But they don't look at it objectively. They feel they're achievers if they get a Nobel Prize.
###410 They feel good about it, rather than share it with other labs. You know.
###416 They don't have a scientific attitude yet. It isn't here yet.
###422 And if somebody advocates it, then you build a following.
###427 And a following does not give an interpretation of Darwin's theory of evolution. There are people that
###433 do that too - say "there's no evidence." If there's lots of evidence, they don't know what evidence means.
###440 If the evidence is that the trees of a million years ago are different than the trees today. They evolve;
###447 they change. Not necessarily for the better. There were poisonous snakes during the time of dinosaurs.
###455 I'm sure they were different than the snakes of today.
###459 But all animals seem to undergo change according to digging into the ground.
###467 I don't think people will study too much of the past, except that nations, took over other nations, took
###475 their wares, but no species by Patrick Henry, or anybody else. Cause they couldn't say anything relevant.
###483 I don't listen to most political speeches. Cause they don't say anything. They rarely say "we can improve
###490 automotive production by sharing idea's with different companies." They don't say that.
###500 I don't find enough evidence to identify with peer groups. Do you know what I mean?
###507 I'm not saying they don't exist. I'm sure there are people out there in the scientific world that would
###513 jump onto this. But some scientists may say "Have you heard about The Venus Project?" - "Oh, that guy
###521 is self-made. Never heard of him making any contributions."
###526 You know. They might do that. I don't know what they do. But, I can't concern myself with what they do.
###533 So here I'm proposing something. I wish that a lot of doctors at the same time said "Wash your hands."
###540 It was only one guy. And they say "What's your basis for that?" They didn't all have microscopes in the old days.
###548 So he showed them germs on the skin. That was when the real change came. With the microscope.
###555 But, there were people that even said "Well, how do you know they cause disease?" They were always present
###563 when a person had eruptions on the skin. That type of bacteria. When they had visual problems,
###571 they found the bacteria that was responsible. They always found similar bacteria on the eyes, on the hands,
###577 on the genitals, sexually transmitted bacteria were the same. Do you understand what I mean.
###584 But it wasn't until the microscope that uniform agreement can be established. It could not be established
###591 by debate. No matter how - unless the doctor was very important. Most doctors listen to the established
###600 leader of a system. We have no established leaders.
###607 All I'd like to do is get the ball rolling, take it from there. But before I get the ball rolling, I want to get
###613 the idea's out on education, on learning theory, on how the brain is influenced by environment.
###623 If I can get that out, that's a good safety measure to control values, more so.
###632 I'd like to get "I don't know" out there too, more so.
###637 "I don't know." "I don't know enough about it to make a decision."
