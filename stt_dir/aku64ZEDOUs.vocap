###12 -What do you think, Dave?
###14 DAVE HATCHETT: I think it's time to go off, off the
###18 Richter scale, that is.
###20 If you flash a line 15, 20 years ago, and it's a big,
###23 gnarly line in Alaska or wherever, and you flash it
###26 clean, what's the difference between then and
###28 20 years from now?
###29 You could put it in a segment today, and a lot of the riders
###32 would love to have that in their part if they
###34 rode it that well.
###36 MIKE HATCHETT: I can go back to "TB5" and watch a movie.
###38 And I'm not trying to sound arrogant or whatever on the
###40 filmmaking point of it, but I can put in
###42 "TB5" Alaska footage.
###44 And I can put in Alaska footage from this year, and I
###47 can be like, I don't see a difference.
###50 In fact, I think the stuff from '95 is almost better.
###52 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###68 DAVE DOWNING: Yeah, "TB5," Johan part
###70 was the one for sure.
###72 It still is.
###72 You look back at that part, and if he filmed that right
###76 now, it'd still be a groundbreaking part
###78 right now, I think.
###79 And that's pretty cool to witness that firsthand, see it
###83 with my own eyes.
###84 JEREMY JONES: He's like a wild animal.
###89 He'd get to the top and just be like, cameramen, media,
###92 this is Johan.
###93 I'm dropping in 10 seconds.
###96 And cameramen are just scrambling.
###99 No back and forth.
###100 That would be the only communication
###102 you'd hear from Johan.
###103 And then he'd go do something that no one's ever done before
###106 on a snowboard.
###107 And half of his best riding probably wasn't on film,
###111 because he didn't feel like waiting for cameramen.
###113 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###130 EIKI HELGASON: Yeah, this was the first Standard movies from
###133 one to six just a few weeks ago.
###135 And man, the riders there were just standing it for the
###138 sketchiest jumps and bigger then than they're doing today.
###142 It's so sick.
###143 I got so pumped just seeing back flips
###144 off the biggest cliffs.
###146 And front flips.
###148 They're standing it.
###149 I like that.
###150 JEREMY JONES: Noah's descent in "TB5" on Super Spines is
###156 hands down--
###159 changed what that dream run was in big mountain
###161 riding in one line.
###163 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###180 DAVE HATCHETT: Definitely my most famous first descent is
###182 the Mendenhall Towers.
###183 And that was in Juno.
###185 We had a heli, and we were like, we want to go there, we
###188 want to go there.
###189 And we just started pointing at the mountains, which are
###191 all basically now the runs that are right off the road.
###193 But at that point, they were all--
###195 a good portion of them were first descents.
###197 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###207 JEREMY JONES: I would say both of those descents, the Super
###209 Spines descent and the Mendenhall Towers descent--
###213 before those guys did that, no one thought that you could
###216 ever ski or snowboard down something like that.
###218 It just shattered the ceiling and was like, we were all
###222 looking over this way, they go and do this, and we're like,
###226 OK, that's what we should be looking at.
###228 JIM RIPPEY: And as I would talk to people who would watch
###230 the videos--
###232 it's usually those one or two shots where you almost kill
###236 yourself and you're just totally, totally going for it
###241 that they remember.
###241 LONNIE KAUK: Yeah, "TB4" was the one.
###243 Like, you see Rippey doing that big old
###245 back flip off of there.
###247 And it was just like next level.
###249 You're like, I want to be that dude
###251 snowboarding in the video.
###252 JIM RIPPEY: We got out of the helicopter.
###254 Terje saw something he wanted to do, some turns down below.
###258 And I didn't really see anything.
###261 So I kind of walked over to the ridge, and I saw this
###263 perfect cliff.
###264 I've always loved jumping off cliffs, because what you get
###267 when you jump off a cliff is, you get that acceleration
###270 experience where you're going from going really slow and
###274 just feel that drop rate.
###275 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###281 TERJE HAAKONSEN: If I remember, we did a run right
###283 next to it, like first time I went on a big mountain that
###286 was that long and that steep for that long.
###289 And what I remember is just doing airs on the way down on
###292 small, little bumps.
###293 And you would just fly for so long, because it was so steep.
###295 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###305 JIM RIPPEY: I remember him being like, this is sketchy,
###308 this is sketchy.
###309 Like, of course it's sketchy.
###309 We're flying around in a helicopter looking over these
###313 crazy peaks.
###314 TERJE HAAKONSEN: The whole intensity level when you go
###317 first is obviously a little higher because what's going to
###321 happen and stuff.
###322 We tore airs up there, too, and Jim.
###325 I'm like, yeah, sure, you could go first.
###328 And then Mike on the radio, Terje, you're going first, and
###331 you're going now.
###334 I'm like, OK.
###335 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###348 DAVE HATCHETT: This looks so easy.
###349 You're like, I could do that.
###350 But you don't really realize, or maybe you do, what could
###354 happen if something went wrong.
###355 And that's when you watch the bail segments, and you watch
###357 Tom tumble through rocks, or some of Jeremy's close calls.
###361 And you really, really realize what could happen if you hook
###365 an edge in the chute or a rock line.
###366 And all it takes is one tumble onto a rock, and you're toast.
###370 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###377 LONNIE KAUK: They'll show a video, and people will just be
###380 like, oh, dude, I would've done that, or I would've went
###382 there, I would've done that.
###384 You're like, dude, you got no idea what it looks like when
###386 you're riding down that.
###386 Like, dude, you're either scared as shit, or you just
###389 forget where you're at.
###390 And it freaks you out.
###391 And then everybody's like, oh, dude,
###392 you're just riding along.
###394 It doesn't mean anything.
###395 It's like, dude, you have no idea what it takes to freaking
###398 do that stuff.
###399 It's gnarly.
###400 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###409 JEREMY JONES: The thing with riding these serious lines is
###413 crew is everything.
###415 And Mike and Dave are some of the best, most experienced
###419 guys in the mountains in the world.
###420 So when I'm on a line and need to get advice, I can call up
###425 the cameramen and they're giving me world-class, on
###429 point feedback.
###431 MIKE HATCHETT: Even me, I'll let my guard down, just not
###434 thinking, hey, is that guy in the right spot to respond to a
###437 rescue or whatever?
###439 You see people, and there's just three dudes on the slope
###443 at the same time, and that guy's in the way of the
###444 [? abbey, ?] and there's some guy standing on the cornice,
###446 and that guy's snowmobiling here, and just no one--
###449 they're just like, dude, what if something happens?
###453 Is anyone ready?
###454 Is anyone even paying attention here?
###455 JIM RIPPEY: They take the back country seriously.
###458 They assess the snow conditions.
###460 And Mike is always taking that very serious, way more serious
###463 than I did.
###464 There was a lot of times where Mike and I would almost butt
###467 heads, because I'm like, let me do this.
###468 And he'd be like, no, it's not safe.
###470 JEREMY JONES: watch a kid be lining up a gap or something.
###474 And I've seen them time and again be like, you know what,
###478 I haven't seen enough out of you that tells me that you're
###480 going to make that gap.
###481 You came up short on this jump, you overshot this jump,
###485 and there's a five foot sweet spot.
###486 And if you don't get it, you're going to hurt yourself.
###488 I'm not shooting it.
###489 DAVE HATCHETT: I've definitely seen and witnessed a lot of
###492 really close calls with me filming other riders with
###494 trees that have been way too close for comfort.
###498 TOM BURT: We were trying this follow-cam shot through this
###502 little slot rock.
###503 But it had a little wave in it, it's a wind wave, but it
###508 was almost like a kicker.
###509 DAVE HATCHETT: We saw a little wind drift at the bottom, and
###511 we threw snowballs at it.
###513 And it seemed soft.
###514 The snowballs disappeared, and we all agreed it
###517 looked like it was OK.
###519 There was a tree kind of in the fall line to the right.
###521 But we all thought, oh, we'll just hit that little snow
###523 drift, and we'll just ride right over it.
###525 TOM BURT: And so I went through.
###526 And I don't want to hit that lip.
###528 I got bucked, but when he hit it, he was
###531 trying to save the camera.
###533 And he got whipped around and lost his edge.
###535 And then he slid down the hill and slammed this
###537 tree that was there.
###538 DAVE HATCHETT: He must have missed the tree by two to six
###541 inches, maybe.
###542 I just grazed the tree with the tail of my snowboard, kind
###546 of sliding butt-first down the hill.
###549 Luckily, that's how I hit it, tail first.
###551 And it was actually enough force to break my femur.
###554 And it broke my femur and my hip.
###555 So of course, I was completely out that year.
###557 And it was definitely a pretty big blow to me.
###560 Physically, it was an insane injury to come back from.
###563 And after that, I wanted to come back, and I wanted to do
###567 everything I was doing before.
###569 But by the time I came back from the injury, it was
###571 another year and then another year after that to even be
###575 100% again.
###577 And at that point, I was a couple years older, and I just
###579 kind of realized some things.
###580 And I kind of lost the desire after that.
###583 I would say that, in a sense, breaking my femur put an end
###586 to my snowboard career.
###587 So definitely, trees don't move when you hit them.
