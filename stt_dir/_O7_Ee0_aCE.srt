1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:23,87



2
0:0:23,87 --> 0:0:26,7
CHRIS ROACH: How's that mic
sounding now, is it all right?


3
0:0:26,7 --> 0:0:27,83
Yeah, I have duct tape.


4
0:0:27,83 --> 0:0:32,624
We could actually kind of put a
pinch on it and tape it up.


5
0:0:32,624 --> 0:0:33,51
-Yeah.


6
0:0:33,51 --> 0:0:34,547
CHRIS ROACH: You want
to do that?


7
0:0:34,547 --> 0:0:35,797
-Yeah, that's fine.


8
0:0:35,797 --> 0:0:38,51



9
0:0:38,51 --> 0:0:42,31
CHRIS ROACH: When you put a
little pressure down on it--


10
0:0:42,31 --> 0:0:43,73
yeah.


11
0:0:43,73 --> 0:0:45,27
Yep, 250F.


12
0:0:45,27 --> 0:0:51,31
This is my son's 150 and my
other son's little TTR50.


13
0:0:51,31 --> 0:0:53,75
We're all into motocross, man.


14
0:0:53,75 --> 0:1:1,65



15
0:1:1,65 --> 0:1:6,317
Yeah, Santa Cruz is just doing
an amateur team this year.


16
0:1:6,317 --> 0:1:7,51
-Oh really?


17
0:1:7,51 --> 0:1:8,73
CHRIS ROACH: Yeah, so--


18
0:1:8,73 --> 0:1:10,99
oh, here they are, right here.


19
0:1:10,99 --> 0:1:13,87
And I called them, you know,
I've been dealing with them


20
0:1:13,87 --> 0:1:19,7
forever, but I'll be their only
rider that's, I guess, a


21
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:20,43
professional.


22
0:1:20,43 --> 0:1:22,18
But I'm old.


23
0:1:22,18 --> 0:1:23,485
You know what I mean?


24
0:1:23,485 --> 0:1:25,93
[LAUGH]


25
0:1:25,93 --> 0:1:27,83
I got a model from last
year with Santa Cruz.


26
0:1:27,83 --> 0:1:28,9
[INAUDIBLE]


27
0:1:28,9 --> 0:1:30,82
I don't know if you
ever saw that one.


28
0:1:30,82 --> 0:1:41,82
But, this year's board,
this one here.


29
0:1:41,82 --> 0:1:47,0
And this is what I did when I
rode, I think, in , like, '90


30
0:1:47,0 --> 0:1:47,94
or '91 or something.


31
0:1:47,94 --> 0:1:50,1
I just stickered my
board this way.


32
0:1:50,1 --> 0:1:52,94
And then they sublimated it
and made those graphics.


33
0:1:52,94 --> 0:1:55,51
That one right there I ride
at the Donner Vintage one.


34
0:1:55,51 --> 0:2:1,77
That was my first model, the one
with the genie up there is


35
0:2:1,77 --> 0:2:3,1
my first one.


36
0:2:3,1 --> 0:2:5,896
And I rode that at that Donner
Vintage contest.


37
0:2:5,896 --> 0:2:8,211
-We probably didn't have one.


38
0:2:8,211 --> 0:2:9,6
[LAUGH]


39
0:2:9,6 --> 0:2:10,99
I got lucky.


40
0:2:10,99 --> 0:2:14,28
When I was younger, I gave all
that shit to my mom, you know?


41
0:2:14,28 --> 0:2:16,63
I knew I wouldn't build any out
with all your friends and


42
0:2:16,63 --> 0:2:18,58
shit, taking everything.


43
0:2:18,58 --> 0:2:21,81
Palmer's board, for the
championship, him and Brushy


44
0:2:21,81 --> 0:2:23,55
we're going against
each other.


45
0:2:23,55 --> 0:2:26,2
And it was raining on the
snow, so I quit riding,


46
0:2:26,2 --> 0:2:28,934
started drinking and cheering
them on because it was so


47
0:2:28,934 --> 0:2:30,96
shitty, I mean, you couldn't
even get above the pipe.


48
0:2:30,96 --> 0:2:35,66
It says Roach did not win the
truck, but I did get mad, and


49
0:2:35,66 --> 0:2:37,64
we will get drunk [LAUGH]


50
0:2:37,64 --> 0:2:39,1
in '92.


51
0:2:39,1 --> 0:2:40,14
And he just destroyed
his board.


52
0:2:40,14 --> 0:2:41,93
And I'm like, dude, let
me have that board.


53
0:2:41,93 --> 0:2:43,246
Write me a story on it.


54
0:2:43,246 --> 0:2:46,23
He should do [INAUDIBLE], too.


55
0:2:46,23 --> 0:2:49,77
My biggest influence in
snowboarding was him and Noah,


56
0:2:49,77 --> 0:2:51,373
for sure-- no doubt about it.


57
0:2:51,373 --> 0:2:54,5
I mean, those guys were the
gnarliest guys, man.


58
0:2:54,5 --> 0:2:57,13
We need Noah's rhino to
get up there, man.


59
0:2:57,13 --> 0:2:58,38
We're going to have to walk.


60
0:2:58,38 --> 0:3:1,362



61
0:3:1,362 --> 0:3:3,3
NOAH SALASNEK: So you know,
he's an a regional Grass


62
0:3:3,3 --> 0:3:3,75
Valley guy.


63
0:3:3,75 --> 0:3:6,42
And though I do live here now,
I'm not from this area.


64
0:3:6,42 --> 0:3:9,24
So Chris, and Tucker, and Monte,
and all these guys are


65
0:3:9,24 --> 0:3:10,95
from Grass Valley.


66
0:3:10,95 --> 0:3:13,32
And I always respected that
whole little crew because they


67
0:3:13,32 --> 0:3:14,68
were all so talented.


68
0:3:14,68 --> 0:3:18,72
So I'd see them riding and
ended up meeting then and


69
0:3:18,72 --> 0:3:20,93
becoming friends with them,
I guess, over the years.


70
0:3:20,93 --> 0:3:23,46
Yeah, it's always been a mutual
friendship, either


71
0:3:23,46 --> 0:3:25,58
skating, or snowboarding,
and now motocross


72
0:3:25,58 --> 0:3:26,61
occasionally together.


73
0:3:26,61 --> 0:3:29,32
And we stayed friends,
and it's pretty cool.


74
0:3:29,32 --> 0:3:31,26
He's a really good skateboarder,
too, and people


75
0:3:31,26 --> 0:3:32,55
probably don't know that
he's a really good


76
0:3:32,55 --> 0:3:33,79
motocross rider, too.


77
0:3:33,79 --> 0:3:35,53
He's an avid rider.


78
0:3:35,53 --> 0:3:37,79
And he's been, actually,
competing and doing well.


79
0:3:37,79 --> 0:3:40,98
So it's good to see he's that
motivated, and he's with his


80
0:3:40,98 --> 0:3:42,37
family and works hard.


81
0:3:42,37 --> 0:3:46,37
He's a good guy, so much
respect for him.


82
0:3:46,37 --> 0:3:48,12
CHRIS ROACH: Right now, I'm in
the process of clearing all


83
0:3:48,12 --> 0:3:49,716
this shit out, all this--


84
0:3:49,716 --> 0:3:51,21
you know what poison oak is?


85
0:3:51,21 --> 0:3:51,58
Yeah.


86
0:3:51,58 --> 0:3:52,49
You guys have that?


87
0:3:52,49 --> 0:3:55,14
So you don't want to
touch any of that.


88
0:3:55,14 --> 0:3:58,238
I get it horribly bad.


89
0:3:58,238 --> 0:4:2,59
Well, I'm going to clear all
this out, so you can actually


90
0:4:2,59 --> 0:4:5,84
walk around everywhere here.


91
0:4:5,84 --> 0:4:7,88
Yeah, this would've been cool
to be able to film this.


92
0:4:7,88 --> 0:4:12,91
This is like, you could've
gotten up there, the view.


93
0:4:12,91 --> 0:4:14,825
This is a triple jump
right here.


94
0:4:14,825 --> 0:4:16,94
That would've been
sick back drop.


95
0:4:16,94 --> 0:4:19,63
Click third gear, and then it's
about a 60 foot double.


96
0:4:19,63 --> 0:4:22,71
And then this one's about 82
right here, step down triple,


97
0:4:22,71 --> 0:4:25,57
right here.


98
0:4:25,57 --> 0:4:27,2
Yeah it's fun, and it goes
all the way around.


99
0:4:27,2 --> 0:4:27,8
I mean, we could walk it.


100
0:4:27,8 --> 0:4:29,19
It goes way up around the
woods over there.


101
0:4:29,19 --> 0:4:32,332
It's got a sick step up, and
then another table out, and


102
0:4:32,332 --> 0:4:33,84
then back round.


103
0:4:33,84 --> 0:4:36,3
It's about a 45-second
long track.


104
0:4:36,3 --> 0:4:37,69
I do a lot of amateur stuff.


105
0:4:37,69 --> 0:4:40,51
I ride the 30-plus intermediate
class, and then


106
0:4:40,51 --> 0:4:41,87
the 250 novice class.


107
0:4:41,87 --> 0:4:46,57
And locally, I ride the
E-street races and


108
0:4:46,57 --> 0:4:49,38
then we do hang town.


109
0:4:49,38 --> 0:4:52,79
We did the MX crossover
down there.


110
0:4:52,79 --> 0:4:55,86
I think I got it than that
in the monster class.


111
0:4:55,86 --> 0:4:58,39
And in the intermediate
class, I got third.


112
0:4:58,39 --> 0:4:59,4
Fuck, that sucks.


113
0:4:59,4 --> 0:5:0,74
I wish I could write it.


114
0:5:0,74 --> 0:5:4,5
It'd be so sick with you
standing up on the ditch, and


115
0:5:4,5 --> 0:5:6,78
me stepping up to you.


116
0:5:6,78 --> 0:5:9,46
There's a rock plant that's
just right down the street


117
0:5:9,46 --> 0:5:10,74
that I work with all the time.


118
0:5:10,74 --> 0:5:14,22
They're going to sell me some
sand for cheap, so I'll bring


119
0:5:14,22 --> 0:5:16,48
a bunch of sand in here,
and just this'll


120
0:5:16,48 --> 0:5:17,56
be like a sand track.


121
0:5:17,56 --> 0:5:18,69
That'll be sick.


122
0:5:18,69 --> 0:5:20,44
And then, once again,
you just land.


123
0:5:20,44 --> 0:5:23,28
So this is just a third gear
little step up right here.


124
0:5:23,28 --> 0:5:25,18
I tried to mimic Hangtown's
step up.


125
0:5:25,18 --> 0:5:27,3
Yeah this give here that you've
going to step down,


126
0:5:27,3 --> 0:5:27,7
[INAUDIBLE]


127
0:5:27,7 --> 0:5:30,35
and then the line is kind
of right there.


128
0:5:30,35 --> 0:5:33,27
I mean, you can see, it's like
the perfect, fastest


129
0:5:33,27 --> 0:5:34,3
lines on the edge.


130
0:5:34,3 --> 0:5:35,11
It's so nice.


131
0:5:35,11 --> 0:5:38,32
The tracks are probably about
45 minutes away from me.


132
0:5:38,32 --> 0:5:40,29
So having this here, it
gives me the exercise


133
0:5:40,29 --> 0:5:41,325
whenever I want it.


134
0:5:41,325 --> 0:5:44,9
And it's just so nice.


135
0:5:44,9 --> 0:5:47,19
Rider's 2 and 1/2, almost
three, and he's real


136
0:5:47,19 --> 0:5:48,573
interested in it.


137
0:5:48,573 --> 0:5:51,67
And my other son, Talon,
he's 8, and he's


138
0:5:51,67 --> 0:5:54,1
totally into motocross.


139
0:5:54,1 --> 0:5:56,98
And Jaren's just, he's
got the 150.


140
0:5:56,98 --> 0:5:58,48
He loves it too.


141
0:5:58,48 --> 0:6:1,71
So they're all into snowboarding
and motocross.


142
0:6:1,71 --> 0:6:4,43
Yeah, they love skateboarding,
but I'm kind


143
0:6:4,43 --> 0:6:5,18
of hurt right now.


144
0:6:5,18 --> 0:6:8,2
So it's too bad because
they should be skating


145
0:6:8,2 --> 0:6:8,88
even though I'm not.


146
0:6:8,88 --> 0:6:11,96
But right now they've kind of
do everything that I do.


147
0:6:11,96 --> 0:6:14,736
So skateboarding's had
to take a backseat to


148
0:6:14,736 --> 0:6:15,93
everything right now.


149
0:6:15,93 --> 0:6:16,83
It's unfortunate.


150
0:6:16,83 --> 0:6:19,475
That's what hurts the
most on my leg.


151
0:6:19,475 --> 0:6:22,875
So I've got to wait to get it
fixed in early winter, and


152
0:6:22,875 --> 0:6:24,125
I'll probably be back
to skateboarding.


153
0:6:24,125 --> 0:6:26,85



154
0:6:26,85 --> 0:6:28,495
Skateboarding, I started when
I was really young.


155
0:6:28,495 --> 0:6:30,79
I started skateboarding,
probably, when I was five


156
0:6:30,79 --> 0:6:31,77
years old or whatnot.


157
0:6:31,77 --> 0:6:34,6
And if I could get my leg
fixed now, I'd still be


158
0:6:34,6 --> 0:6:36,735
skateboarding, which
I plan on doing.


159
0:6:36,735 --> 0:6:39,445
I mean, skateboarding will
always be in my blood.


160
0:6:39,445 --> 0:6:41,21
Skateboarding gave me
snowboarding, is


161
0:6:41,21 --> 0:6:42,365
the way I see it.


162
0:6:42,365 --> 0:6:45,566
And snowboarding has given
me what I have now.


163
0:6:45,566 --> 0:6:48,52
So I owe a lot to, probably,
skateboarding and


164
0:6:48,52 --> 0:6:49,5
snowboarding.


165
0:6:49,5 --> 0:6:52,36
They give you the same great
feelings when you learn


166
0:6:52,36 --> 0:6:54,82
something, or you're progressing
or whatever.


167
0:6:54,82 --> 0:6:56,25
Oh, well I grew up in
Salinas till I was


168
0:6:56,25 --> 0:6:57,73
probably 10 years old.


169
0:6:57,73 --> 0:7:0,49
And we were skateboarders
down there in Salinas.


170
0:7:0,49 --> 0:7:3,355
And then, when I moved up here,
we met the skateboarders


171
0:7:3,355 --> 0:7:4,81
that a lived in Grass Valley.


172
0:7:4,81 --> 0:7:6,71
And Tucker Fransen was
one of the them.


173
0:7:6,71 --> 0:7:8,64
He's the one that got me
into snowboarding.


174
0:7:8,64 --> 0:7:11,91
And we start going to
Donner ski ranch


175
0:7:11,91 --> 0:7:14,17
with him and his family.


176
0:7:14,17 --> 0:7:18,49
We hiked around, I guess, before
we went to Donner in


177
0:7:18,49 --> 0:7:19,27
the back country.


178
0:7:19,27 --> 0:7:22,74
And then Donner ski ranch was
the first resort that opened


179
0:7:22,74 --> 0:7:24,15
up to us for snowboarding.


180
0:7:24,15 --> 0:7:27,37
And then we spent most of our
time there, probably, for the


181
0:7:27,37 --> 0:7:29,21
next five years, at Donner.


182
0:7:29,21 --> 0:7:35,95
Probably been John Ackright,
and Damian Sanders, Tucker,


183
0:7:35,95 --> 0:7:38,2
myself, my brother--


184
0:7:38,2 --> 0:7:38,91
yeah that's probably--


185
0:7:38,91 --> 0:7:41,306
I don't know, those are the
guys I was riding with.


186
0:7:41,306 --> 0:7:43,79
Yeah, Monty and I rode
pretty much together


187
0:7:43,79 --> 0:7:47,8
the whole time we--


188
0:7:47,8 --> 0:7:48,99
he drove before I could
even drive.


189
0:7:48,99 --> 0:7:50,85
And so we were always
riding together.


190
0:7:50,85 --> 0:7:54,92
And he had the same passions,
did the same things, so--


191
0:7:54,92 --> 0:7:59,39
CIRCE WALLACE: Chris and Monty
were the quintessential Grass


192
0:7:59,39 --> 0:8:1,27
Valley troublemakers.


193
0:8:1,27 --> 0:8:2,75
You know, they were cute.


194
0:8:2,75 --> 0:8:4,69
They were blonde..


195
0:8:4,69 --> 0:8:5,94
They were very California.


196
0:8:5,94 --> 0:8:8,47



197
0:8:8,47 --> 0:8:10,21
They were kind of
good old boys.


198
0:8:10,21 --> 0:8:11,79
So they were always
having fun.


199
0:8:11,79 --> 0:8:16,435
And Chris had a really
respectable style.


200
0:8:16,435 --> 0:8:21,26
I mean, to this day, I think he
was one of the most stylish


201
0:8:21,26 --> 0:8:23,4
snowboarders.


202
0:8:23,4 --> 0:8:28,13
He had a very distinct way of
riding that a lot of people


203
0:8:28,13 --> 0:8:29,65
really responded to.


204
0:8:29,65 --> 0:8:30,52
DAMIAN SANDERS: Yeah,
Chris Roach?


205
0:8:30,52 --> 0:8:31,56
He's got a talent.


206
0:8:31,56 --> 0:8:33,48
He's got a style that
was just insane.


207
0:8:33,48 --> 0:8:35,58
He had a skate style
that was so cool.


208
0:8:35,58 --> 0:8:37,6
He would poke out a frontside
air and just hold it for the


209
0:8:37,6 --> 0:8:39,362
longest time like Chris Miller
on a skateboard.


210
0:8:39,362 --> 0:8:41,19
And it was just the coolest
looking thing.


211
0:8:41,19 --> 0:8:43,24
It's like a guy at a motocross
whipping it and just holding


212
0:8:43,24 --> 0:8:44,39
that whip forever.


213
0:8:44,39 --> 0:8:45,75
It was so much style.


214
0:8:45,75 --> 0:8:47,66
And everybody else was,
like, get the trick


215
0:8:47,66 --> 0:8:48,912
done, do it real quick.


216
0:8:48,912 --> 0:8:51,53
But Roach was right out
of the stoner guy


217
0:8:51,53 --> 0:8:52,94
from the surfer movies.


218
0:8:52,94 --> 0:8:54,9
He was like a Spicoli.


219
0:8:54,9 --> 0:8:55,696
He was fucking hilarious.


220
0:8:55,696 --> 0:8:57,17
TODD RICHARDS: Roach's
style was all about


221
0:8:57,17 --> 0:8:59,403
being, like, really--


222
0:8:59,403 --> 0:9:0,653
fucking train--


223
0:9:0,653 --> 0:9:3,61



224
0:9:3,61 --> 0:9:8,29
Roach's style was all about
being super squatty, and


225
0:9:8,29 --> 0:9:10,64
really tight and compact.


226
0:9:10,64 --> 0:9:12,23
I mean, we were grabbing
way up on our


227
0:9:12,23 --> 0:9:13,25
tip and doing methods.


228
0:9:13,25 --> 0:9:16,26
Every grab that Roach
did was like full


229
0:9:16,26 --> 0:9:18,86
skate, around his feet.


230
0:9:18,86 --> 0:9:20,43
Everything was proper.


231
0:9:20,43 --> 0:9:24,14
And there wasn't just wherever
your hand happens to hit while


232
0:9:24,14 --> 0:9:24,99
you're flying through the air.


233
0:9:24,99 --> 0:9:27,99
But that's what we were
doing back East.


234
0:9:27,99 --> 0:9:29,27
And those guys were all tight.


235
0:9:29,27 --> 0:9:31,16
Everything the super tight.


236
0:9:31,16 --> 0:9:33,1
KEVIN ENGLISH: They were there
kind of what I'd say is the


237
0:9:33,1 --> 0:9:33,95
next generation.


238
0:9:33,95 --> 0:9:37,245
They were the young dudes when
Damian, and Sione, and Graham


239
0:9:37,245 --> 0:9:38,49
were the big guys.


240
0:9:38,49 --> 0:9:40,51
And I definitely got into in.


241
0:9:40,51 --> 0:9:44,26
There's a shot of Chris Roach
doing a frontside I grab in


242
0:9:44,26 --> 0:9:46,9
the Western Front that
is so insane.


243
0:9:46,9 --> 0:9:49,68
And it's probably only like
three feet off the ground.


244
0:9:49,68 --> 0:9:52,55
But he was, in my mind, the
first guy that brought style


245
0:9:52,55 --> 0:9:53,33
to snowboarding.


246
0:9:53,33 --> 0:9:57,5
So in terms of how you actually
rode, I would try to


247
0:9:57,5 --> 0:10:0,85
more emulate, probably, Chris
Roach than anybody else.


248
0:10:0,85 --> 0:10:2,55
MIKE RANQUET: Because he was
the coolest looking due I'd


249
0:10:2,55 --> 0:10:4,75
ever seen at that point.


250
0:10:4,75 --> 0:10:6,97
I remember first seeing
him in the Sims ad.


251
0:10:6,97 --> 0:10:9,48
And I snowboarded
for Sims then.


252
0:10:9,48 --> 0:10:13,69
And just doing this frontside
nose bone.


253
0:10:13,69 --> 0:10:16,74
Aaron was like, dude,
that guy's so rad.


254
0:10:16,74 --> 0:10:17,77
You know?


255
0:10:17,77 --> 0:10:21,5
CHRIS ROACH: Well, I always just
did what felt good to me.


256
0:10:21,5 --> 0:10:25,99
And I know I mean I had posters
up of Palmer and


257
0:10:25,99 --> 0:10:29,94
Kidwell doing backside airs in
my room when I was a kid.


258
0:10:29,94 --> 0:10:33,56
So I felt like I needed to look
like that or something


259
0:10:33,56 --> 0:10:34,33
close to that.


260
0:10:34,33 --> 0:10:36,11
And what I saw me riding,
or whatever I


261
0:10:36,11 --> 0:10:37,68
always felt, eh, whatever.


262
0:10:37,68 --> 0:10:40,86
But everyone always said that
I had good style or whatnot.


263
0:10:40,86 --> 0:10:42,88
And now, I really appreciate
it more than


264
0:10:42,88 --> 0:10:44,13
I did then, I guess.


265
0:10:44,13 --> 0:10:47,96



266
0:10:47,96 --> 0:10:50,8
SHAWN FARMER: You know what
always used to trip me out?


267
0:10:50,8 --> 0:10:54,42
This is so funny, man, but I
used to look at Chris Roach


268
0:10:54,42 --> 0:10:58,38
and go, that's looks
like Palmer.


269
0:10:58,38 --> 0:10:59,42
That's Palmer.


270
0:10:59,42 --> 0:11:0,83
I thought it was Palmer.


271
0:11:0,83 --> 0:11:3,0
And I'd go, but Palmer's
riding goofy?


272
0:11:3,0 --> 0:11:4,26
That's not Palmer.


273
0:11:4,26 --> 0:11:5,72
Palmer doesn't ride goofy.


274
0:11:5,72 --> 0:11:8,792
I used to think Chris Roach
was Shaun Palmer.


275
0:11:8,792 --> 0:11:11,45
You know, I did.


276
0:11:11,45 --> 0:11:14,32
But then I'd realize,
he's goofy, man.


277
0:11:14,32 --> 0:11:17,286
Just in videos, when I first
started seeing him.


278
0:11:17,286 --> 0:11:18,99
And then, I don't know,
I mean, I'm just


279
0:11:18,99 --> 0:11:19,98
equating the style.


280
0:11:19,98 --> 0:11:24,64
But yeah I talk to people who
don't know who Chris Roach is.


281
0:11:24,64 --> 0:11:27,9
I'm like, really?


282
0:11:27,9 --> 0:11:29,55
Fuck, come on.


283
0:11:29,55 --> 0:11:32,16
MIKE HATCHETT: I'm always
impressed when a snowboarder


284
0:11:32,16 --> 0:11:36,5
today knows who Damian
Saunders is, or


285
0:11:36,5 --> 0:11:39,49
Chris Roach, Kidwell.


286
0:11:39,49 --> 0:11:41,41
You've got to know where
it came from.


287
0:11:41,41 --> 0:11:44,42
And I always give props the
kids that have done their


288
0:11:44,42 --> 0:11:47,13
homework and seen the old
videos or whatever.


289
0:11:47,13 --> 0:11:50,23
I mean, a lot of guys are
like, who's Damian?


290
0:11:50,23 --> 0:11:51,18
Who's Chris Roach?


291
0:11:51,18 --> 0:11:52,33
I was like, are you
kidding me?


292
0:11:52,33 --> 0:11:55,385
Who's Chris Roach?


293
0:11:55,385 --> 0:11:58,32
Hey, if you're not a
pro, that's cool.


294
0:11:58,32 --> 0:11:59,84
But if you're a pro snowboarder,
you'd better know


295
0:11:59,84 --> 0:12:2,96
who Chris Roach is,
in my opinion.


296
0:12:2,96 --> 0:12:5,14
-So Mr. Roach, how
do you feel about


297
0:12:5,14 --> 0:12:7,5
California Snowboard Series.


298
0:12:7,5 --> 0:12:8,29
CHRIS ROACH: I would
do it again.


299
0:12:8,29 --> 0:12:9,1
[INAUDIBLE]


300
0:12:9,1 --> 0:12:10,77
GS is rad.


301
0:12:10,77 --> 0:12:12,43
They set up good GS courses.


302
0:12:12,43 --> 0:12:16,69
It was structured and pipes
and types of stuff.


303
0:12:16,69 --> 0:12:18,85
Dude, I don't know,
[INAUDIBLE].


304
0:12:18,85 --> 0:12:23,41
Yeah, fully because
I won that.


305
0:12:23,41 --> 0:12:26,6
CHRIS ROACH: The California
state snowboard series, and


306
0:12:26,6 --> 0:12:29,43
that was just kind of the lope
for the local mountains.


307
0:12:29,43 --> 0:12:32,95
We went up to Shasta and
just all the local


308
0:12:32,95 --> 0:12:33,77
mountains around here.


309
0:12:33,77 --> 0:12:39,51
And I think I won that series,
but we raised gates at that


310
0:12:39,51 --> 0:12:42,1
point, too, and half-pipe
gates,


311
0:12:42,1 --> 0:12:43,1
moguls, it didn't matter.


312
0:12:43,1 --> 0:12:45,73
We did everything
at that point.


313
0:12:45,73 --> 0:12:49,66
We went to Breckenridge, and
that was the World Cup.


314
0:12:49,66 --> 0:12:55,66
And I broke my Sims board that
I'd bought in the pipe.


315
0:12:55,66 --> 0:12:58,46
And Tom Sims actually
watched me break it.


316
0:12:58,46 --> 0:13:1,53
And I think that was my biggest
break, was from Tom


317
0:13:1,53 --> 0:13:5,66
watching me snap that board
because he might have been


318
0:13:5,66 --> 0:13:7,0
watching me earlier
in the day.


319
0:13:7,0 --> 0:13:11,27
And then he invited me
to is hotel room.


320
0:13:11,27 --> 0:13:14,17
And he had probably 100 boards
in there, and he said, you


321
0:13:14,17 --> 0:13:17,62
pick one and if you do well,
we'll try to see what we can


322
0:13:17,62 --> 0:13:18,24
do from here.


323
0:13:18,24 --> 0:13:21,52
And that was probably the best
thing I ever could have done,


324
0:13:21,52 --> 0:13:22,973
is break that board.


325
0:13:22,973 --> 0:13:27,49
TODD SIMS: Well, that whole
NorCal scene had a lot of


326
0:13:27,49 --> 0:13:30,24
players, like Tucker
Fransen, and Chris


327
0:13:30,24 --> 0:13:32,85
Roach, and Noah Salasnek.


328
0:13:32,85 --> 0:13:39,81
These guys all sort of had kind
of is the Sims soul in


329
0:13:39,81 --> 0:13:44,12
those days because they had
their skateboard background,


330
0:13:44,12 --> 0:13:49,3
and they were low key, and they
performed incredibly.


331
0:13:49,3 --> 0:13:53,36
And that was sort of the whole
image of what a Sim rider was,


332
0:13:53,36 --> 0:13:57,5
just almost by default
because these guys--


333
0:13:57,5 --> 0:13:59,78
I don't remember the exact time
that each one of them


334
0:13:59,78 --> 0:14:2,63
ended up on the team, but it
was almost like, sure, of


335
0:14:2,63 --> 0:14:4,35
course you're on the team.


336
0:14:4,35 --> 0:14:6,79
CHRIS ROACH: Oh for me, it was
a dream come true because I


337
0:14:6,79 --> 0:14:7,78
was a skateboarder.


338
0:14:7,78 --> 0:14:10,59
And I got all the skateboards
and all that.


339
0:14:10,59 --> 0:14:13,982
And then Sims was such a big
company for means because I


340
0:14:13,982 --> 0:14:15,85
was a kid, on it was Sims.


341
0:14:15,85 --> 0:14:18,97
It was like skating,
snowboarding, and


342
0:14:18,97 --> 0:14:20,7
knowing who Tom was.


343
0:14:20,7 --> 0:14:23,2
And Terry Kidwell rode for
them, and Shaun Palmer.


344
0:14:23,2 --> 0:14:26,82
And those guys were my heroes of
snowboarding then, as well,


345
0:14:26,82 --> 0:14:29,61
so it was rad to be on the
same team as them.


346
0:14:29,61 --> 0:14:33,42
And Sims was paying me $700 a
month, and I was, like, that's


347
0:14:33,42 --> 0:14:34,3
a career, man, that's killer.


348
0:14:34,3 --> 0:14:35,86
You know, when you're
that young.


349
0:14:35,86 --> 0:14:40,8
And by the time I switched to
Santa Cruz, I got on with


350
0:14:40,8 --> 0:14:42,31
Santa Cruz, and they were paying
me good money, and then


351
0:14:42,31 --> 0:14:46,16
Quicksilver, and got with
Dragon, and Vans.


352
0:14:46,16 --> 0:14:49,55
And I just felt like, at that
point, that I could probably


353
0:14:49,55 --> 0:14:51,4
make a living off it.


354
0:14:51,4 --> 0:14:54,47
So I don't know what year
it was or whatever.


355
0:14:54,47 --> 0:14:56,44
But I knew I couldn't
work, man.


356
0:14:56,44 --> 0:14:57,98
And I had to do that because I
didn't know what the hell else


357
0:14:57,98 --> 0:14:59,77
I was going to do.


358
0:14:59,77 --> 0:15:1,37
Didn't do good in school.


359
0:15:1,37 --> 0:15:2,62
Wasn't that smart.


360
0:15:2,62 --> 0:17:2,62
