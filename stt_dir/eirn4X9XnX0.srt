1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:15,685



2
0:0:15,685 --> 0:0:17,67
JOANNA FUERTES-KNIGHT:
The Royals!


3
0:0:17,67 --> 0:0:20,9
Rulers of this mighty kingdom.


4
0:0:20,9 --> 0:0:23,67
Now, the queen may be having a
glorious nationwide party for


5
0:0:23,67 --> 0:0:26,83
her Diamond Jubilee, but it's
going to be nowhere near as


6
0:0:26,83 --> 0:0:29,152
good as my patriotic picnic.


7
0:0:29,152 --> 0:0:29,598
Harry!


8
0:0:29,598 --> 0:0:31,382
MALE SPEAKER: Jubilee picnic.


9
0:0:31,382 --> 0:0:34,32
JOANNA FUERTES-KNIGHT: So today
for my royal hamper, I'm


10
0:0:34,32 --> 0:0:38,38
going to be making a pink
lemonade Victoria sponge, some


11
0:0:38,38 --> 0:0:42,53
cava-jam with scones, and then
some dog food sausage rolls


12
0:0:42,53 --> 0:0:43,653
for the corgis.


13
0:0:43,653 --> 0:0:44,599
Arf, arf, arf.


14
0:0:44,599 --> 0:0:47,91
MALE SPEAKER: Pink
lemonade cake.


15
0:0:47,91 --> 0:0:50,52
JOANNA FUERTES-KNIGHT: So I've
decided to bring the Victoria


16
0:0:50,52 --> 0:0:54,72
sponge up-to-date and make
a pink lemonade cake.


17
0:0:54,72 --> 0:0:57,37
It's like any other cake, you're
going to start with


18
0:0:57,37 --> 0:0:59,13
breaking some eggs.


19
0:0:59,13 --> 0:1:2,9
Harry's my favorite, because I
imagine if it wasn't a royal


20
0:1:2,9 --> 0:1:4,989
he'd just be daggering
some girl at Oceana,


21
0:1:4,989 --> 0:1:7,12
knocking back Reefs.


22
0:1:7,12 --> 0:1:10,29
I kind of feel sorry for the
queen, because her life is


23
0:1:10,29 --> 0:1:13,67
just an endless stream of being
forced to go to public


24
0:1:13,67 --> 0:1:15,17
events, looking at things.


25
0:1:15,17 --> 0:1:17,295
When I bet all she really
wants to do


26
0:1:17,295 --> 0:1:18,74
is hang out at Windsor.


27
0:1:18,74 --> 0:1:21,43
Walking around with a rifle,
with a Rothman fag hanging out


28
0:1:21,43 --> 0:1:23,475
of her mouth and just finding
wild rabbits to


29
0:1:23,475 --> 0:1:24,52
shoot in the face.


30
0:1:24,52 --> 0:1:27,21
If I were the queen, I would
just get a hologram like


31
0:1:27,21 --> 0:1:30,58
Tupac, and send it out to
do all the shitty work.


32
0:1:30,58 --> 0:1:31,915
Make sure it's whisked
thoroughly.


33
0:1:31,915 --> 0:1:34,7
And then you're going to
put it in the two tins.


34
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:38,8
So it's one in the pink
and two in the tins.


35
0:1:38,8 --> 0:1:40,58
MALE SPEAKER: Cava-jam scones.


36
0:1:40,58 --> 0:1:43,61
JOANNA FUERTES-KNIGHT: So the
jam is really simple.


37
0:1:43,61 --> 0:1:47,26
It's just blueberries,
sugar, and some cava.


38
0:1:47,26 --> 0:1:49,54
And you're going to dump
that all in a pan.


39
0:1:49,54 --> 0:1:50,74
It's really funny.


40
0:1:50,74 --> 0:1:53,96
I guess from the outside looking
in, as a nation we


41
0:1:53,96 --> 0:1:55,44
must look really patriotic.


42
0:1:55,44 --> 0:1:58,49
Because whenever there's any
kind of royal bank holiday,


43
0:1:58,49 --> 0:2:0,5
everyone has a party and
gets shit-faced.


44
0:2:0,5 --> 0:2:3,35
It's almost like a nationwide
Nottinghill


45
0:2:3,35 --> 0:2:5,521
carnival for white people.


46
0:2:5,521 --> 0:2:8,83
MALE SPEAKER: Dog
sausage rolls.


47
0:2:8,83 --> 0:2:10,85
JOANNA FUERTES-KNIGHT: Now, I
don't want to leave out the


48
0:2:10,85 --> 0:2:14,26
best bit of the royal family,
and that's the Queen's corgis.


49
0:2:14,26 --> 0:2:17,77
So I'm going to make them some
dog food sausage rolls.


50
0:2:17,77 --> 0:2:21,15
So the first step is to roll
out some puff pastry.


51
0:2:21,15 --> 0:2:23,29
I couldn't be fucked
to make my own.


52
0:2:23,29 --> 0:2:26,11
You have to be an idiot with too
much time on their hands


53
0:2:26,11 --> 0:2:27,85
to make your own puff pastry.


54
0:2:27,85 --> 0:2:29,45
I like corgis.


55
0:2:29,45 --> 0:2:32,5
Because you know when you look
at something really cute and


56
0:2:32,5 --> 0:2:33,47
you want to crush it?


57
0:2:33,47 --> 0:2:36,26
Just things that are already
pudgy with big eyes, you want


58
0:2:36,26 --> 0:2:37,41
to squeeze it to death.


59
0:2:37,41 --> 0:2:39,94
They're so cute, I want
to crush their skulls.


60
0:2:39,94 --> 0:2:48,706



61
0:2:48,706 --> 0:2:50,66
Oh, fuck it.


62
0:2:50,66 --> 0:2:52,69
Oh, I got it on my crotch.


63
0:2:52,69 --> 0:2:57,97
And now to roll them up
into roll shapes.


64
0:2:57,97 --> 0:2:59,64
You're going to pop
these in the oven.


65
0:2:59,64 --> 0:3:1,12
They go all puffed
up and golden.


66
0:3:1,12 --> 0:3:5,476



67
0:3:5,476 --> 0:3:6,928
MALE SPEAKER: Cake layers.


68
0:3:6,928 --> 0:3:13,565



69
0:3:13,565 --> 0:3:16,55
JOANNA FUERTES-KNIGHT: So I've
used most of the homemade


70
0:3:16,55 --> 0:3:19,5
cava-jam already in my scones.


71
0:3:19,5 --> 0:3:20,465
I'm just going to put
it in the filling


72
0:3:20,465 --> 0:3:22,75
of my lemonade cake.


73
0:3:22,75 --> 0:3:27,0
I'd rather have a chemical
rainbow in my mouth than bite


74
0:3:27,0 --> 0:3:29,88
into a bean burger that
takes like a coaster.


75
0:3:29,88 --> 0:3:34,64
That's what science is for,
making things better.


76
0:3:34,64 --> 0:3:38,53
I'm really sick of all these
pretentious foodies.


77
0:3:38,53 --> 0:3:40,43
Good food doesn't need fancy


78
0:3:40,43 --> 0:3:43,96
ingredients to taste delicious.


79
0:3:43,96 --> 0:3:45,1
There you go.


80
0:3:45,1 --> 0:3:46,486
It's a cake fit for a queen.


81
0:3:46,486 --> 0:3:50,746



82
0:3:50,746 --> 0:3:53,38
Who's a good corgi, hm?


83
0:3:53,38 --> 0:3:54,63
Good corgi.


84
0:3:54,63 --> 0:3:58,365



85
0:3:58,365 --> 0:3:59,615
Aw!


86
0:3:59,615 --> 0:4:4,97



87
0:4:4,97 --> 0:4:6,22
Good corgi.


88
0:4:6,22 --> 0:6:6,22
