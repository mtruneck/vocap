1
0:0:3,647 --> 0:0:5,727
<i>Christmas Eve,</i>


2
0:0:5,727 --> 0:0:8,487
<i>When you spend every</i>
<i>waking moment in a hospital</i>


3
0:0:8,487 --> 0:0:10,487
<i>it's hard to get into the spirit,</i>


4
0:0:10,487 --> 0:0:14,487
Are you aware that
you're in everyone's way?


5
0:0:14,487 --> 0:0:16,247
Everyone's way?


6
0:0:16,247 --> 0:0:20,647
Or your way? Think about it.


7
0:0:20,647 --> 0:0:23,447
Think about it?
l'll think about it.


8
0:0:23,447 --> 0:0:26,527
<i>Still there are</i>
<i>some traditions I enjoy,</i>


9
0:0:26,527 --> 0:0:46,607
<i>Like Nurse Tisdale's 9, 1 5 cup of coffee,</i>


10
0:0:46,607 --> 0:0:48,647
- Carla, what time is it?
- l don't know


11
0:0:48,647 --> 0:0:51,767
but l'm guessing
it's about 9.1 5ish.


12
0:0:51,767 --> 0:0:55,87
This thing!


13
0:0:55,87 --> 0:0:57,447
- Who put this up?
- l did.


14
0:0:57,447 --> 0:1:0,647
l drove round the whole city
before my 5am shift,


15
0:1:0,647 --> 0:1:3,447
just looking for that.


16
0:1:3,447 --> 0:1:5,647
Trying to add a little cheer.


17
0:1:5,647 --> 0:1:9,447
You will not ruin my Christmas.
Not again.


18
0:1:9,447 --> 0:1:12,87
Not this year.


19
0:1:12,87 --> 0:1:14,647
l've only worked here for three months.


20
0:1:14,647 --> 0:1:18,927
<i>Things could be worse, I could be with</i>
<i>Elliot doing my day in the free clinic,</i>


21
0:1:18,927 --> 0:1:21,327
l understand that you took a cab here.


22
0:1:21,327 --> 0:1:25,367
But l can't give you Vicodin
because your teeth are itchy.


23
0:1:25,367 --> 0:1:26,567
Dr Kelso?


24
0:1:26,567 --> 0:1:31,647
l don't want to sound insensitive, but
why don't these people have any money?


25
0:1:31,647 --> 0:1:35,527
l don't know, sir,
they probably waste it all on food.


26
0:1:35,527 --> 0:1:37,647
l need you to precept a patient.


27
0:1:37,647 --> 0:1:41,167
1 9-year-old with abdominal pain.
She's eight months pregnant.


28
0:1:41,167 --> 0:1:43,807
l'll let the family practice people
handle it.


29
0:1:43,807 --> 0:1:47,887
Wonderful idea, except
l heard your smart-aleck remark


30
0:1:47,887 --> 0:1:50,607
so why don't you keep
your little pregnant girl?


31
0:1:50,607 --> 0:1:55,487
lt'll be good practice since you'll
probably end up in a female specialty.


32
0:1:55,487 --> 0:1:58,167
What do you mean by that?
l'm internal medicine.


33
0:1:58,167 --> 0:2:1,647
Well, of course you are.
But numbers don't lie


34
0:2:1,647 --> 0:2:5,767
and most women end up in OB-G YN,
family practice or paediatrics.


35
0:2:5,767 --> 0:2:9,47
lt's like a riptide, sweetheart,
pulling and pulling,


36
0:2:9,47 --> 0:2:11,767
and you can swim against
the current all you want.


37
0:2:11,767 --> 0:2:16,607
When Mr Stork comes a-calling, you won't
think, ''l'm internal medicine.''


38
0:2:16,607 --> 0:2:22,527
lt's gonna be, ''Oh! Look at the baby!''


39
0:2:22,527 --> 0:2:25,327
Sir, l have to say, l'm offended.


40
0:2:25,327 --> 0:2:46,327
Oh, no. Now l have to go
buy flowers to make it right.


41
0:2:46,327 --> 0:2:50,207
Newbie, stay.
What a good boy you are.


42
0:2:50,207 --> 0:2:53,567
Dear God, Judy,
how much product do you use?


43
0:2:53,567 --> 0:2:55,647
None. lt's like this when l wake up.


44
0:2:55,647 --> 0:2:57,527
Quick tip, there, sports star.


45
0:2:57,527 --> 0:3:3,327
When you're defensive about your
feminine side, it makes you more girly.


46
0:3:3,327 --> 0:3:6,967
- You want something?
- Nobody likes a cranky punching bag.


47
0:3:6,967 --> 0:3:10,327
And yes, it's about a patient.
Pretty good friend of mine.


48
0:3:10,327 --> 0:3:13,767
<i>I guess that means</i>
<i>he respects me a little,</i>


49
0:3:13,767 --> 0:3:16,407
Randy, Jackie, what do you say?


50
0:3:16,407 --> 0:3:20,207
This is the monkey l got
to videotape the birth.


51
0:3:20,207 --> 0:3:21,647
<i>I hate him,</i>


52
0:3:21,647 --> 0:3:24,367
<i>But not as much as</i>
<i>I hate moments like these,</i>


53
0:3:24,367 --> 0:3:28,567
<i>There's nothing I can do for him but</i>
<i>when I go in the family'll look at me</i>


54
0:3:28,567 --> 0:3:37,967
<i>like I've got some</i>
<i>magical power to fix him,</i>


55
0:3:37,967 --> 0:3:49,567
Hey, everybody!


56
0:3:49,567 --> 0:3:56,47
l'm sorry, it's been two weeks, and your
son shows no neurological improvement.


57
0:3:56,47 --> 0:4:0,7
lt was a miracle! First of all, the man
was near dead. Then he comes out.


58
0:4:0,7 --> 0:4:3,287
- You're ridiculous.
- l'm telling you it was a miracle.


59
0:4:3,287 --> 0:4:6,287
- lt was not a miracle.
- Yes, it was. Dude...


60
0:4:6,287 --> 0:4:10,167
l envy Turk. To be that sure
of something, to have that faith.


61
0:4:10,167 --> 0:4:13,127
<i>That doesn't mean I don't</i>
<i>love busting him about it,</i>


62
0:4:13,127 --> 0:4:16,287
You think God was responsible
for his recovery?


63
0:4:16,287 --> 0:4:19,7
That's fine.
We all have our beliefs.


64
0:4:19,7 --> 0:4:22,927
l carry around this tiny little
Monopoly piece for good luck.


65
0:4:22,927 --> 0:4:25,847
Did you compare my Lord and Saviour
to a tiny top hat?


66
0:4:25,847 --> 0:4:28,7
He did, l heard him, baby.
Go get him.


67
0:4:28,7 --> 0:4:32,7
Excuse me, Nurse Teresa.
Have you ever read the Bible?


68
0:4:32,7 --> 0:4:35,807
l started it. Then l skipped to the end
and it ruined it for me.


69
0:4:35,807 --> 0:4:41,767
That's it. Both of you to the window.
Let's go. Right now.


70
0:4:41,767 --> 0:4:46,127
''When they saw the star,
they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.''


71
0:4:46,127 --> 0:4:49,967
Matthew, 2:1 0.


72
0:4:49,967 --> 0:4:52,687
Dude, that's just
a Christmas tree in the park.


73
0:4:52,687 --> 0:4:54,807
l understand what you're saying.


74
0:4:54,807 --> 0:4:57,847
Please. You can't just jump back
on my good side.


75
0:4:57,847 --> 0:5:0,7
You see all of this right here?


76
0:5:0,7 --> 0:5:1,967
And this?


77
0:5:1,967 --> 0:5:3,47
And this?


78
0:5:3,47 --> 0:5:7,367
Consider yourself cut off.
Full love embargo, baby.


79
0:5:7,367 --> 0:5:9,527
- That's not gonna last.
- lt will last.


80
0:5:9,527 --> 0:5:10,967
- Yeah?
- lt's gonna last.


81
0:5:10,967 --> 0:5:18,967
What if l came up to you, all tired,
and l just... l had to yawn...?


82
0:5:18,967 --> 0:5:22,207
Damn!


83
0:5:22,207 --> 0:5:24,487
- How pathetic is that?
- Do it again.


84
0:5:24,487 --> 0:5:27,47
Please.


85
0:5:27,47 --> 0:5:30,927
This is from last night.
The Christmas tree over at Miller Park.


86
0:5:30,927 --> 0:5:34,567
God, l love that tree.
lt's so beautiful, isn't it?


87
0:5:34,567 --> 0:5:37,167
- l've been there almost...
- Listen, Meredith.


88
0:5:37,167 --> 0:5:40,567
You're pregnant.
Pretty far along, actually.


89
0:5:40,567 --> 0:5:43,407
What? That's not possible.


90
0:5:43,407 --> 0:5:46,847
What am l supposed to do?


91
0:5:46,847 --> 0:5:51,447
''Look at the baby!''


92
0:5:51,447 --> 0:5:54,87
Babies aren't really my thing,


93
0:5:54,87 --> 0:5:59,487
so l'm just gonna go get you
someone else to talk to.


94
0:5:59,487 --> 0:6:5,287
lt's great to see you guys again.
Really, all three of you.


95
0:6:5,287 --> 0:6:8,127
What is it with friends
wanting to be in your life?


96
0:6:8,127 --> 0:6:9,847
Selfish is what it is.


97
0:6:9,847 --> 0:6:12,7
l got Randy and Jackie in the divorce.


98
0:6:12,7 --> 0:6:14,727
<i>My God his ex-wife,</i>
<i>The tension actually hurts,</i>


99
0:6:14,727 --> 0:6:17,807
<i>You have to break it,</i>
<i>Say something, Anything!</i>


100
0:6:17,807 --> 0:6:19,767
Banana hammock!


101
0:6:19,767 --> 0:6:23,567
Your ability to thrive under pressure
is what drove you to medicine.


102
0:6:23,567 --> 0:6:26,207
You should have seen him
when he was a new intern.


103
0:6:26,207 --> 0:6:31,527
''l. Don't. Want. To. Be. A. Doctor.''


104
0:6:31,527 --> 0:6:36,527
You know, l think we all know
that's just not true.


105
0:6:36,527 --> 0:6:40,167
l'm assuming, since you
already took everything else,


106
0:6:40,167 --> 0:6:42,367
that you're here for my self-respect,


107
0:6:42,367 --> 0:6:45,287
but there's bad news
on that one, sweetcheeks.


108
0:6:45,287 --> 0:6:51,167
l already gave it to your mom
when she begged me to marry you.


109
0:6:51,167 --> 0:6:56,127
l wouldn't have room for it, what with
your testicles in my trophy case.


110
0:6:56,127 --> 0:6:58,167
Holy cow.


111
0:6:58,167 --> 0:7:1,47
Who's better?
You got me by the short hairs.


112
0:7:1,47 --> 0:7:3,407
See ya.


113
0:7:3,407 --> 0:7:5,727
What do you hate most
about the holidays?


114
0:7:5,727 --> 0:7:9,47
- Wrapping presents. You?
- My family.


115
0:7:9,47 --> 0:7:11,727
l don't know how anyone
can get in the spirit here.


116
0:7:11,727 --> 0:7:14,927
Come on, guys. All the spirit
you need is right here.


117
0:7:14,927 --> 0:7:17,87
Can l get a amen?


118
0:7:17,87 --> 0:7:20,727
<i>Turk's always been good</i>
<i>at rallying people,</i>


119
0:7:20,727 --> 0:7:22,887
Congregation, l said,
can l get a amen?


120
0:7:22,887 --> 0:7:24,207
Amen!


121
0:7:24,207 --> 0:7:26,647
'Tis the season of givin', y'all.


122
0:7:26,647 --> 0:7:31,327
What better place to give
than right here at Sacred Heart?


123
0:7:31,327 --> 0:7:36,687
Lovest thou me,
then feed my sheep!


124
0:7:36,687 --> 0:7:42,727
Right here, at Sacred Heart,
we are not only gonna feed his sheep...


125
0:7:42,727 --> 0:7:45,7
...but we gonna clothe them.


126
0:7:45,7 --> 0:7:47,527
- And we gonna bathe them.
- Bathe them!


127
0:7:47,527 --> 0:7:49,367
And we gonna cut 'em open.


128
0:7:49,367 --> 0:7:52,407
Then we gonna stitch 'em
right back together.


129
0:7:52,407 --> 0:7:57,287
Because that is what
Christmas....


130
0:7:57,287 --> 0:7:58,527
...is all about.


131
0:7:58,527 --> 0:8:1,87
That's right! Preach, preach!


132
0:8:1,87 --> 0:8:48,47
What's the name of the song
we're singing today?


133
0:8:48,47 --> 0:8:51,647
Right, listen.
l'm on call tonight.


134
0:8:51,647 --> 0:8:55,847
But tomorrow morning, when l get home,
we're going to Mass before work, OK?


135
0:8:55,847 --> 0:8:57,407
OK, sweetie.


136
0:8:57,407 --> 0:9:0,487
<i>I don't wanna go to Mass</i>
<i>in the stupid,,,</i>


137
0:9:0,487 --> 0:9:6,407
<i>Candy!</i>


138
0:9:6,407 --> 0:9:7,687
l was trying to...


139
0:9:7,687 --> 0:9:10,447
l know exactly what
you're trying to do, but...


140
0:9:10,447 --> 0:9:13,567
you're not gonna break
my Christmas spirit. You can't.


141
0:9:13,567 --> 0:9:16,167
Not ever. l'm the Holly Jolly Janitor.


142
0:9:16,167 --> 0:9:21,47
Little girl. What do you want
for Christmas...?


143
0:9:21,47 --> 0:9:24,927
l know you must be busy. lt's really
nice of you to offer to do this.


144
0:9:24,927 --> 0:9:27,687
lt's no problem.


145
0:9:27,687 --> 0:9:30,647
<i>Childbirth has been so romanticised,</i>


146
0:9:30,647 --> 0:9:33,287
<i>I guess because if people</i>
<i>knew the truth,,,</i>


147
0:9:33,287 --> 0:9:36,687
<i>Congratulations!</i>
<i>You're expecting,</i>


148
0:9:36,687 --> 0:9:41,47
<i>Your doctor will tell you</i>
<i>everything you need to know,</i>


149
0:9:41,47 --> 0:9:42,327
<i>Hi doctor,</i>


150
0:9:42,327 --> 0:9:45,967
You'll fart, pee, puke and poop
in front of ten complete strangers


151
0:9:45,967 --> 0:9:54,7
who'll be staring
intently at your vagina,


152
0:9:54,7 --> 0:9:55,807
You do it.


153
0:9:55,807 --> 0:10:2,927
<i>Still no matter what the realities</i>
<i>the end result is always the same,</i>


154
0:10:2,927 --> 0:10:4,767
Look at the baby!


155
0:10:4,767 --> 0:10:7,407
lt's a bouncing baby boy.


156
0:10:7,407 --> 0:10:17,887
Yet another soldier
in the fight against Communism!


157
0:10:17,887 --> 0:10:24,367
- Where's the girl that was in here?
- l just make beds.


158
0:10:24,367 --> 0:10:27,887
l got Meredith Fox's blood work.
She's got HELLP syndrome.


159
0:10:27,887 --> 0:10:31,327
She needs to deliver
immediately so let's get...


160
0:10:31,327 --> 0:10:33,807
What do you mean she just left?


161
0:10:33,807 --> 0:10:36,767
Get me any contact numbers.


162
0:10:36,767 --> 0:10:43,167
- Why did she leave?
- Again. Bed-maker.


163
0:10:43,167 --> 0:10:46,927
Newbie, l always punch
the tabs out of my tapes


164
0:10:46,927 --> 0:10:49,447
so there's no way
they can be recorded over.


165
0:10:49,447 --> 0:10:55,407
So please tell me you didn't use
the tape that was already in the camera.


166
0:10:55,407 --> 0:10:56,687
Banana hammock.


167
0:10:56,687 --> 0:11:0,367
So, in other words,
there is no permanent historical record


168
0:11:0,367 --> 0:11:3,727
of the birth of my friend's baby?


169
0:11:3,727 --> 0:11:6,727
Well, l think that the baby itself


170
0:11:6,727 --> 0:11:11,7
would serve as proof that it was,
you know...


171
0:11:11,7 --> 0:11:13,927
...born.


172
0:11:13,927 --> 0:11:16,207
You don't understand
what you've done.


173
0:11:16,207 --> 0:11:19,407
My ex-wife is gonna hold this
over my head for so long


174
0:11:19,407 --> 0:11:22,447
that l doubt l'll ever
see the sun again.


175
0:11:22,447 --> 0:11:26,967
And l liked the sun, Newbie.
lt made me hopeful.


176
0:11:26,967 --> 0:11:28,367
Well, l was there.


177
0:11:28,367 --> 0:11:31,207
l could certainly jot down some of my...


178
0:11:31,207 --> 0:11:36,87
...feelings and impressions.


179
0:11:36,87 --> 0:11:39,527
<i>If he was really mad at me</i>
<i>he would have stayed and yelled at me,</i>


180
0:11:39,527 --> 0:11:44,127
<i>Don't kid yourself,</i>
<i>I couldn't be any madder at you,</i>


181
0:11:44,127 --> 0:11:50,967
<i>No do not do that again,</i>
<i>That's a bad Newbie,</i>


182
0:11:50,967 --> 0:11:54,887
<i>I can go home now, Maybe</i>
<i>it's because Christmas is a hard time</i>


183
0:11:54,887 --> 0:11:57,287
<i>or because too many families</i>
<i>get together</i>


184
0:11:57,287 --> 0:12:43,207
<i>but Christmas Eve it's one of the</i>
<i>worst nights of the year to be on call,</i>


185
0:12:43,207 --> 0:12:46,447
l can't believe l'm wearing a suit
at 6.30 in the morning.


186
0:12:46,447 --> 0:12:48,647
lf you ruin this for Turk,
l'll hurt you.


187
0:12:48,647 --> 0:12:51,687
Noted.


188
0:12:51,687 --> 0:12:55,247
You better hurry up.
Mass starts in 1 5 minutes.


189
0:12:55,247 --> 0:12:58,607
- l'm not going.
- Great. Can l go back to bed?


190
0:12:58,607 --> 0:13:1,727
l'm kidding. l wanna get
some of them church crackers.


191
0:13:1,727 --> 0:13:6,87
No, l'm not going.
Ever.


192
0:13:6,87 --> 0:13:9,647
Baby, what happened?


193
0:13:9,647 --> 0:13:13,87
Turk? Turk, come on...


194
0:13:13,87 --> 0:13:17,327
<i>Merry Christmas,</i>


195
0:13:17,327 --> 0:13:18,807
You're overreacting.


196
0:13:18,807 --> 0:13:22,567
A girl said, ''What am l gonna do?''
and l said, ''Babies aren't my thing.''


197
0:13:22,567 --> 0:13:24,687
How could l be too hard on myself?


198
0:13:24,687 --> 0:13:26,807
<i>Just don't say</i>
<i>''Banana hammock'',</i>


199
0:13:26,807 --> 0:13:29,607
Look, l'm sure she'll turn up.


200
0:13:29,607 --> 0:13:33,967
That's exactly what's gonna happen.
She'll turn up, have a healthy baby


201
0:13:33,967 --> 0:13:37,367
and nothing'll ever happen
to either one of them.


202
0:13:37,367 --> 0:13:40,287
<i>I never really thought</i>
<i>of faith as important,</i>


203
0:13:40,287 --> 0:13:46,567
<i>But without his I don't know</i>
<i>Turk kinda seems like he's fading away,</i>


204
0:13:46,567 --> 0:13:50,87
<i>I could use a little faith, I have to</i>
<i>tell them I didn't tape a thing,</i>


205
0:13:50,87 --> 0:13:53,447
You made some interesting
choices with the camera, Orson.


206
0:13:53,447 --> 0:13:55,967
- You didn't want any faces?
- Excuse me?


207
0:13:55,967 --> 0:13:58,207
l switched the tapes.
Just go with it.


208
0:13:58,207 --> 0:14:0,487
Here it comes, l see the head!


209
0:14:0,487 --> 0:14:3,567
- What a gorgeous head of hair.
- That's funny.


210
0:14:3,567 --> 0:14:6,407
He was bald when he was in here
a few minutes ago.


211
0:14:6,407 --> 0:14:8,647
- Yeah, well...
- We shaved the baby.


212
0:14:8,647 --> 0:14:11,727
- You shaved the baby?
- Shaved it.


213
0:14:11,727 --> 0:14:15,807
Standard procedure. What with
the recent outbreak of pre-natal lice.


214
0:14:15,807 --> 0:14:18,407
Yep. Definitely.


215
0:14:18,407 --> 0:14:21,967
Shave and haircut.


216
0:14:21,967 --> 0:14:23,287
Two bits.


217
0:14:23,287 --> 0:14:28,47
Really?


218
0:14:28,47 --> 0:14:29,927
l'm not buying it.


219
0:14:29,927 --> 0:14:32,887
You two are gonna go by the
nursery and see baby Charlie?


220
0:14:32,887 --> 0:14:35,47
- Absolutely.
- Yes.


221
0:14:35,47 --> 0:14:41,527
Charlie and his new haircut.


222
0:14:41,527 --> 0:14:47,407
- Have we checked the other hospitals?
- They haven't seen her, honey.


223
0:14:47,407 --> 0:14:49,767
Dr Reid, isn't this your day off?


224
0:14:49,767 --> 0:14:53,847
- lt's that pregnant girl...
- The one who went missing.


225
0:14:53,847 --> 0:14:57,167
And now you're here, voluntarily,


226
0:14:57,167 --> 0:15:0,927
hell bent on finding
one of your little lost ducklings.


227
0:15:0,927 --> 0:15:5,47
lt's important you understand something.
l'm not interested in babies.


228
0:15:5,47 --> 0:15:7,247
l don't melt when l see them,


229
0:15:7,247 --> 0:15:10,7
l don't have a yearning
to make them my life's work.


230
0:15:10,7 --> 0:15:13,207
l'm a doctor interested in my patients,
male or female.


231
0:15:13,207 --> 0:15:15,847
Right now, one of them needs help.


232
0:15:15,847 --> 0:15:21,607
God! Do l know women.


233
0:15:21,607 --> 0:15:24,167
l don't get it. Why are we on the roof?


234
0:15:24,167 --> 0:15:28,607
l wanted to show you that no matter
how ugly things can get down there,


235
0:15:28,607 --> 0:15:31,7
there's still a lot of beauty up here.


236
0:15:31,7 --> 0:15:36,47
ls that... gum or pigeon crap
on my sneaker?


237
0:15:36,47 --> 0:15:38,927
Come on, look around.


238
0:15:38,927 --> 0:15:41,727
There's nobody here,
no one can see us.


239
0:15:41,727 --> 0:15:44,567
We could do whatever we wanted.


240
0:15:44,567 --> 0:15:46,127
Like what?


241
0:15:46,127 --> 0:15:47,847
How are you not getting this?


242
0:15:47,847 --> 0:15:51,207
You mean have relations.


243
0:15:51,207 --> 0:15:54,167
You wanna have relations
right here on the roof.


244
0:15:54,167 --> 0:15:57,727
The pebbles will make my ass
look like a chocolate chocolate chip.


245
0:15:57,727 --> 0:16:2,367
l can make you see God again,
or at least call out his name.


246
0:16:2,367 --> 0:16:4,47
ls this a joke to you?


247
0:16:4,47 --> 0:16:6,807
No, l'm just trying
to help you feel better.


248
0:16:6,807 --> 0:16:9,727
- You don't know how l feel.
- Well, then tell me.


249
0:16:9,727 --> 0:16:13,87
l feel abandoned!


250
0:16:13,87 --> 0:16:16,327
All my life, l've believed
that God listens to our prayers,


251
0:16:16,327 --> 0:16:20,807
and that he cares for us
and that he watches over us.


252
0:16:20,807 --> 0:16:26,687
Last night, so many people
needed to be watched over.


253
0:16:26,687 --> 0:16:33,327
How am l supposed to believe in someone
that's gonna let innocent people suffer?


254
0:16:33,327 --> 0:16:36,527
Answer me, please.


255
0:16:36,527 --> 0:16:41,247
l can't.


256
0:16:41,247 --> 0:16:43,127
Did you see baby Charlie yet?


257
0:16:43,127 --> 0:16:46,527
Oh, yeah, l was just planning
on doing that. Never.


258
0:16:46,527 --> 0:16:48,567
You're such a special friend.


259
0:16:48,567 --> 0:16:51,567
Gosh, Marjorie,
aren't you sassy today?


260
0:16:51,567 --> 0:16:55,567
Did Santa finally bring you that
Y chromosome you always wanted?


261
0:16:55,567 --> 0:16:59,647
- What's your problem, anyway?
- For starters, l hate Christmas.


262
0:16:59,647 --> 0:17:3,287
l don't like bambersnoodles,
l loathe dinkerwallows,


263
0:17:3,287 --> 0:17:6,367
l hate snagtumgopers,


264
0:17:6,367 --> 0:17:9,247
l say, do you follow?


265
0:17:9,247 --> 0:17:11,127
Do you think l'm a moron?


266
0:17:11,127 --> 0:17:14,647
Don't answer that question.
lt's a trick, that's a trick.


267
0:17:14,647 --> 0:17:16,727
Pre-natal lice?


268
0:17:16,727 --> 0:17:19,447
You do realise that
would be lice in the womb?


269
0:17:19,447 --> 0:17:21,807
l've seen them,
they're real and gross.


270
0:17:21,807 --> 0:17:25,687
<i>Maybe Dr Cox had pushed me too far,</i>
<i>Whatever it was I told on him,</i>


271
0:17:25,687 --> 0:17:28,407
Plus, he didn't even
go see baby Charlie yet.


272
0:17:28,407 --> 0:17:31,487
<i>And then something amazing</i>
<i>happened, They connected,</i>


273
0:17:31,487 --> 0:17:34,167
<i>And all the hatred</i>
<i>they had for each other</i>


274
0:17:34,167 --> 0:17:36,687
<i>was suddenly focused on me,</i>


275
0:17:36,687 --> 0:17:40,367
Excuse me, Sally Sensitive,
l don't remember asking you anything.


276
0:17:40,367 --> 0:17:43,807
Your mom's aware she'll
have to stop breast-feeding?


277
0:17:43,807 --> 0:17:48,407
Good Jordan, good. Now work the body,
under the ribs.


278
0:17:48,407 --> 0:17:53,287
l'm not gonna see that baby either.
Are you gonna tattle on me? Are you?


279
0:17:53,287 --> 0:17:55,447
- l'm frightened.
- Do you have a second?


280
0:17:55,447 --> 0:17:57,367
- God, yes.
- Run away.


281
0:17:57,367 --> 0:18:0,607
l spoke to a 91 1 operator
who got a call from a girl in labour,


282
0:18:0,607 --> 0:18:3,407
but they lost the signal.
l don't know what to do.


283
0:18:3,407 --> 0:18:5,607
<i>One of the worst things</i>
<i>about this place</i>


284
0:18:5,607 --> 0:19:3,287
<i>is how often you feel like</i>
<i>there's no one to turn to,</i>


285
0:19:3,287 --> 0:19:8,247
You'll be OK.


286
0:19:8,247 --> 0:19:10,127
<i>Babies are amazing,</i>


287
0:19:10,127 --> 0:19:13,47
<i>Especially the way</i>
<i>they bring people together,</i>


288
0:19:13,47 --> 0:19:15,127
So, baby Charlie is the bald one?


289
0:19:15,127 --> 0:19:21,87
Yeah. He wouldn't be smiling so much
if he knew how ugly his parents were.


290
0:19:21,87 --> 0:19:27,447
- You're a sexy bitch.
- Thanks.


291
0:19:27,447 --> 0:19:30,567
<i>I really think it's impossible</i>
<i>to be unaffected,</i>


292
0:19:30,567 --> 0:19:34,687
What up, little dawg?


293
0:19:34,687 --> 0:19:39,647
<i>A baby can stir something deep down</i>
<i>inside you you didn't know was there,</i>


294
0:19:39,647 --> 0:19:41,807
Look at the baby!


295
0:19:41,807 --> 0:19:44,647
<i>They help you find something</i>
<i>you thought you'd lost,</i>


296
0:19:44,647 --> 0:19:46,927
How did you know she was here?


297
0:19:46,927 --> 0:19:50,127
l don't know, l just knew.


298
0:19:50,127 --> 0:19:52,487
<i>I guess Turk was right after all,</i>


299
0:19:52,487 --> 0:20:9,567
<i>Miracles do happen,</i>


300
0:20:9,567 --> 0:20:15,967
<i>I think you just have to</i>
<i>be willing to look for them,</i>


301
0:20:15,967 --> 0:20:21,287
Merry Christmas, guys.


302
0:20:21,287 --> 0:20:23,807
God bless us, every one.


303
0:20:23,807 --> 0:20:26,167
Dude, you could not be a bigger dork.


304
0:20:26,167 --> 0:20:28,247
You're so lame.


305
0:20:28,247 --> 0:20:29,727
That was so cheesy.


306
0:20:29,727 --> 0:20:33,967
Really?
Cos l felt like it was... right.


307
0:20:33,967 --> 0:22:33,967
Wait up!
