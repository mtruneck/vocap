###3 LIZARD KING: No.

###8 [LAUGHING].
###10 
###14 Oh!
###15 [LAUGHING].
###18 That's what Mike was talking about.
###20 [LAUGHING].
###21 
###26 FEMALE SPEAKER: Kick your ass.
###27 LIZARD KING: Ha ha!
###28 Did you just see that?
###29 
###32 DON NGUYEN: Can't stand still.
###33 He just has to keep moving and shit.
###35 Yeah, he's always been the same-- super fucking hyper.
###39 ANDREW REYNOLDS: Like, out of everybody on a tour or
###41 something like that, he's probably up first--
###43 him and Antwuan, but Antwuan's mellow-- but he's up first and
###48 just jumping and punching near your face and stuff first
###51 thing from like 8:00 all day long, until he goes to bed.
###54 I don't know where he gets it from.
###56 He's just hyped up.
###58 LIZARD KING: [SINGING]
###65 DON NGUYEN: There was 26 fools rolling in three vans.
###68 MALE SPEAKER: That was nuts.
###69 DON NGUYEN: The sessions that were going down were
###71 in-fucking-sane.
###72 MALE SPEAKER: Is there like sober van and wastoid van?
###75 DON NGUYEN: Yeah, there's like the boss van, the fucking
###79 syrup van, and then our van was just like, whatever man.
###85 MALE SPEAKER: Do you ever give Lizard or Antwuan talks about
###89 their drinking, or drugs, or anything?
###91 JIM GRECO: Yep.
###93 To each his own.
###93 Everybody's different.
###94 Like Dustin, Dustin Dollin, he's fueled by the alcohol.
###99 But yet it destroys his body, so that's where it gets him.
###103 But he's invincible on the alcohol.
###106 Lizard is similar.
###109 Lizard's similar, but he rips drunk or sober.
###114 He's got a little bit more common sense than Dustin.
###118 LIZARD KING: Oh, you're on acid?
###119 He's like, go skate the bowl.
###122 What do you mean, go skate the bowl?
###124 I'm like, I can't skate the bowl right now.
###125 I don't want to skate the bowl right now.
###128 I'm fucked up.
###128 He's like, no, try it.
###130 Let's go test it out.
###131 Went outside, we walked inside, went to the bowl,
###134 shredded the fuck out of the bowl, right?
###137 I came back, turned to him, and was like,
###139 skating on acid is tight.
###141 It's the best shit ever.
###142 JIM GRECO: I just tell him how it was like for me about
###144 drinking and shit.
###145 That it affects you.
###148 Choices you're making now.
###149 And just to be careful and try to figure out in your head
###155 what you want to do before you ruin your chances.
###159 LIZARD KING: He's always like, dude, I'm
###160 going to pray for you.
###160 I mean, I know you don't want me to, but I'm going to do it.
###164 He's not into the whole Satan thing.
###166 I think he thinks of me as a jinx, maybe, or something.
###169 He's just a nutcase, kind of.
###170 I mean, all of us are nutcases, but--
###174 MALE SPEAKER: When you're on death wish, do any of the
###176 other pros like Andrew--
###177 like, some of the older dudes, do they ever give you pep
###180 talks or coach talks?
###181 LIZARD KING: Yeah, yeah.
###182 Sometimes like how if I got sober, how much better I'd be
###188 at skating, and fucking--
###191 a bunch of shit, and how I'm a drug addict and shit.
###193 I think it's pretty funny.
###195 That's all we do, pretty much, shit is pretty funny.
###198 But then the older guys are all sober and shit.
###200 Well, not all off them, but, I mean, Shane,
###203 Drew, fucking Jim.
###206 It's kind of weird.
###208 And the best part is they'll still put footage out that's
###212 really old of them, but it's of them partying and shit,
###216 just to make the part more hijinks
###217 and exciting or something.
###220 MALE SPEAKER: You think you'll eventually quit drinking and
###222 be like those dudes?
###223 Go into that rag?
###224 LIZARD KING: Me?
###224 Fuck, I don't know.
###226 I probably should.
###228 But I'm kind of like, I like being a pile of
###230 shit, though, you know?
###231 
###233 We should make another cruiser board that's like
###235 a AA meeting directory.
###236 MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGH].
###238 And when you get sober, you get the sobriety cruiser.
###241 It's like the AA book.
###243 [LAUGHTER].
###245 LIZARD KING: Isn't that like, 8 o'clock,
###247 Tuesday, fucking pep talk.
###250 That would be fucking hilarious.
###252
