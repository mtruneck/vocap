###13 CARL AZUZ, HOST: A big thanks to Jackson and C.J. for getting things started today. They`re
###17 ready to go and so are we.
###19 It`s Friday, I`m Carl, and this is CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###36 Senkaku and Diaoyu -- two different names for the same set of islands at the center
###40 of some tension between China and Japan. You can see those two countries on this map. And
###45 right in between them, that`s where you`ll find these islands in the East China Sea.
###49 There`s not much to them. They`re rocky. They`re not near much else. No one lives there.
###55 So why is there tension?
###56 Well, China and Japan each say the islands belong to them. Yesterday, this was seen near
###61 the islands -- a Chinese plane. China said it was there to carry out a patrol.
###66 Japan launched its own planes in response, including eight fighter jets. The Chinese
###70 plane was gone by the time the Japanese jets showed up. And while China and Japan have
###75 been kind of wrestling over these islands for a while, this was the first time aircraft
###79 were involved.
###81 Next up, a story from Syria`s civil war. Some of the images from this conflict are difficult
###86 to watch. Some people might find them disturbing, so we want to make you aware of that, because
###90 this story includes footage of a Syrian woman who had been shot by a sniper while she was
###95 walking down the street.
###97 We`re showing it to you because of what happened next.
###100 A Syrian teenager, 17 years old, crawled out into the street to try to save her. He isn`t
###106 her relative or neighbor. They`ve never met. He crawled out through the gunfire and put
###110 his own life at risk because he said he knew he had to save the woman or die trying.
###117 He was able to help get her out of the street. He wasn`t able to save her life.
###121 Later, he talked with CNN`s Arwa Damon.
###123 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###124 ARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: "We wanted to save her, to get her to a hospital. I am
###130 not a hero. I am just like anyone else."
###133 (END VIDEO TAPE)
###134 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit -- decibels are a measure of mass.
###141 Not legit. Decibels measure the intensity of sound, especially loud sounds.
###148 AZUZ: All right, think about when you`re watching a TV show. If you were measuring the speaker`s
###156 dialogue with a decibel meter, it might look something like this, a normal speaking voice.
###160 But then a commercial comes on and suddenly the volume jumps to this.
###164 Take a look at that decibel meter now.
###165 It`s not a problem you`d run into with our show, but the U.S. government gets thousands
###169 of complaints from people who say that the advertisements they see are significantly
###174 louder than the shows they`re watching.
###176 Congress passed the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation, or CALM Act, in 2010.
###182 It basically says that TV stations, both network and cable, have to have commercials that are
###187 at the same volume as the shows they`re airing.
###190 Now, not all business owners are on board with this. They say the whole point of advertising
###193 on TV is to get people`s attention and they`re concerned that the CALM Act might make that
###198 more difficult.
###199 The fastest growing drug problem in the United States, you`re looking at it -- prescription
###204 drug abuse. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one American dies
###208 from a drug overdose every 19 minutes. A pharmaceutical industry representative says the problem here
###215 is balancing those patients who abuse prescription drugs with those who use them responsibly,
###220 and, therefore, get the medical benefit from them.
###222 I spoke about this with CNN`s Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently.
###225 He had some suggestions for avoiding the dangers of prescription drugs.
###229 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###229 AZUZ: Dr. Gupta, we`ve talked about the dangers of prescription medications on CNN STUDENT
###234 NEWS.
###234 When are these things OK to take?
###236 DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There are situations where your doctor is going
###238 to prescribe you these types of medications, uh, and, you know, presumably, in most cases,
###243 that`s going to be OK to take. I think that one of the points we try to make is that we
###246 give a lot of pain medications out in this country and we don`t always try other things
###251 first.
###251 So I think the doctor is going to make a judgment, but you, as a patient, or whoever is watching,
###255 needs to decide, as well, do I really need to take narcotics?
###258 Could this be something that could be helped with something less powerful or -- or just,
###262 you know, something like just stretching and massage?
###263 AZUZ: Let`s say a student does feel like he needs it. Maybe he has a sports injury or
###268 something that causes a lot of pain. Maybe he`s given 10 pills, only needs three or four
###272 of them.
###272 What does he do with the remaining pills?
###274 GUPTA: Well, you know, there is -- this is a -- actually, a very interesting topic. The
###278 medications themselves, you don`t want to sort of get them out there in the general
###281 supply, you don`t want them sitting around in your medicine cabinet, you don`t want them
###284 to flush down the toilet.
###286 Uh, you -- the best thing you could -- you could probably throw them away. But even better
###289 than that, there are some what are known as take- back programs, where the DEA will actually
###294 come and take these medications back. Eventually, they burn them, which is the right thing to
###298 do with these types of medications.
###300 But don`t leave them in your medicine cabinet. People get tempted. Someone else may take
###303 them and that can be a real problem.
###305 AZUZ: The same hypothetical student who`s injured has a brother who gets a similar injury.
###310 Is it ever OK for the brother to take his medication?
###312 GUPTA: It`s -- it`s really not. And -- and, you know, people do this all the time, I -- I
###316 know. And people watching may say that happens in our -- in our own home.
###318 The problem is that, you know, everybody is different. How the medication may react with
###323 somebody could be different. If they`re taking other medications, those medications could
###327 interact. That could be a problem.
###328 But I think psychologically, if you`re just sort of getting some pills from another family
###332 member, you may not take it as seriously.
###334 These are -- these are potentially dangerous pills, and, you know, so you have to treat
###337 it as such.
###338 AZUZ: Especially if they`re taken recreationally, as some people might take them, to get a buzz.
###342 What are the dangers of doing that?
###344 GUPTA: The -- the biggest danger and these types of medications, they -- they affect
###348 a part of the brain that actually makes your body breathe. We`re all breathing like this.
###353 (breathing)
###353 GUPTA: We don`t think about it much. But let`s say you go to sleep and that part of your
###357 brain has been tinkered with a little bit. You may start to lose the urge to breathe
###362 and that`s the concern -- you just stop breathing.
###365 And when we say someone dies every 19 minutes, that`s -- I -- I`ve just described most -- most
###370 likely how it occurs.
###371 The -- the biggest danger with something like this is that you start to take more and more.
###376 It just doesn`t work as well, so you`re taking more and more. It`s not treating your pain
###380 or whatever reason you took it for in the first place, but it is still impairing your
###385 breathing.
###385 So all of a sudden you start to build up that -- that potentially life-threatening effect
###390 of these pills.
###391 AZUZ: Dr. Gupta, thank you for helping us understand these things better, helping us
###394 understand how they can hurt us.
###396 GUPTA: Hope it helps.
###397 Thanks a lot.
###399 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s Shout Out goes out to Coach Bradley`s world history class
###403 at Portland High School in Portland, Tennessee.
###407 Wayne Rooney, Abby Wambach and Sergio Ramos are all known for accomplishments in what
###413 sport?
###413 Here we go.
###415 Is it baseball, soccer, horse racing or auto racing?
###419 You`ve got three seconds.
###421 Go.
###422 (clock ringing)
###425 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Rooney, Wambach and Ramos all found fame on the soccer field.
###431 That`s your answer and that`s your Shout Out.
###436 AZUZ: This past Sunday, Lionel Messi did something that none of those players have done. In fact,
###442 it`s never been done at the top level of soccer before. Messi, who plays professionally for
###447 Barcelona and plays on Argentina`s national team, kicked his 86th goal of 2012 -- 74 for
###454 Barcelona, 12 for Argentina.
###457 That broke a record that`s been around for 40 years. And Messi may not be done yet. Barcelona
###463 still has a few more matches to play in 2012.
###466 When Messi or any player scores in the future, soccer officials want to make sure the ball
###471 crossed the goal line.
###473 Alex Zolbert looks at some technology that could help out.
###475 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###475 ALEX ZOLBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So this is how the GoalRef technology works. Here`s the
###478 soccer ball. Under the skin, you have three coils around the ball.
###483 On the goal post, you have a magnetic ring around the goal post. When the ball goes through
###489 the goal post on this watch that the ref wears, you see goal.
###494 From a confidence point of view, this system will work during the next games, as we always
###499 expected it and as we saw it during the tests.
###501 ZOLBERT: Then there`s Hawk-Eye. It uses a series of cameras to capture the ball`s path,
###508 which can then be reviewed within seconds. Tennis fans know the Hawk-Eye technology well.
###513 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And right near the sideline, Karl Good (ph).
###518 ZOLBERT: The technology doesn`t come cheap, though. FIFA is spending roughly $1 million
###521 U.S. to use the systems here in Japan before giving the nod to one company for next year`s
###528 Confederations Cup in Brazil, ahead of the World Cup there in 2014.
###533 (END VIDEO TAPE)
###534 AZUZ: It`s almost time for us to run.
###536 But before we do, it`s time for this little guy to walk. Nothing like a little kiddy cardio
###542 to get the blood pumping.
###543 Obviously, it`s not an outdoor cat if it prefers to be on a treadmill. When the pace picks
###548 up, the cat does a pretty good job of keeping up, although it does hop off for some quick
###553 breaks in here.
###554 It`s nice to see a pet support its owners workout efforts. Otherwise, it might just
###559 be milling around.
###559 And if you`re thinking of forcing your pet to get on for a few miles, you`d better make
###563 sure it`s in a good mood, because otherwise, I`d tread lightly.
###567 It`s a long way to go for that one pun.
###569 But a quick congratulations to Coronado High School in Henderson, Nevada. A student there
###573 got our social media question right.
###574 We hope all of you have a great weekend.
###576 For CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m Carl Azuz.
