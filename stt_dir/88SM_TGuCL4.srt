1
0:0:2,3 --> 0:0:10,349
I reject that. I reject the idea of modern
neurogolist that might feel that depression


2
0:0:10,349 --> 0:0:20,13
is genetically inherited...or just a re..product
of genetic damage. The reason I don't believe


3
0:0:20,13 --> 0:0:26,73
that is I worked with so many people, alocholics,
drug addicts..people with a prison record


4
0:0:26,73 --> 0:0:32,34
and I took that out in one session. So if
it was genetic it wouldn't come out. That's


5
0:0:32,34 --> 0:0:38,1
how I know it works..and I don't know if you
saved the letters. Do you? That we get from


6
0:0:38,1 --> 0:0:45,35
people that said, "I was about to turn my
life in. I have no reason. You gave me a reason


7
0:0:45,35 --> 0:0:52,96
to live and work." So..that's all I can go
by not genetics. I can't do anything with


8
0:0:52,96 --> 0:1:0,149
genetics. If a doctor says, "Someday we'll
have a cure for Cancer." That may encourage


9
0:1:0,149 --> 0:1:6,88
a person..but it won't encourage me inless
I say, "What is your approach?" and they give


10
0:1:6,88 --> 0:1:12,27
me an approach..that would encourage me..
if I had cancer. Do you understand? If the


11
0:1:12,27 --> 0:1:18,52
guy says, "I'm sure you'll get well. Have
faith in yourself." Cancer don't give a shit


12
0:1:18,52 --> 0:1:27,68
about that. It just keeps multiplying. You
might live a week longer or three weeks longer


13
0:1:27,68 --> 0:1:35,46
if you have..self-confidence..but always ask
a person...like..nobody asks any of these..T..Tea


14
0:1:35,46 --> 0:1:42,579
group people, "What would you do under these
circumstances? How would you solve this problem?


15
0:1:42,579 --> 0:1:47,67
How would you get the Democrats to see the
Republican point of view?" THEY NEVER TALK


16
0:1:47,67 --> 0:1:55,74
ABOUT THAT. They talk about their own limitations.
I would say, therefore, most Capitalist, that


17
0:1:55,74 --> 0:2:2,14
drive that system are very simple people with
a low self-image. Now I did mention in the


18
0:2:2,14 --> 0:2:9,63
past that psychologist have a higher suicide
rate than normal. That means they undergo


19
0:2:9,63 --> 0:2:14,739
depression..and if they really ask the question,
"WHAT IS DEPRESSION?" say, "I don't know"


20
0:2:14,739 --> 0:2:22,269
Then a guy writes a theory of genetics..of
the genes. That doesn't take away the depression.


21
0:2:22,269 --> 0:2:30,76
Do you understand that? Taking drugs might
tranquilize you..or drinking alcohol when


22
0:2:30,76 --> 0:2:35,18
you're depressed might take you out of your
self-image. You just sit there and look around.


23
0:2:35,18 --> 0:2:43,4
It makes you feel relaxed and comfortable.
Next day there's a hangover and the depression......if


24
0:2:43,4 --> 0:2:49,0
you don't deal with it. Now, you can't deal
with it if you don't even know how to go about


25
0:2:49,0 --> 0:2:56,409
looking into it. So let me show you how you
go about looking into, "What is a Depression?".


26
0:2:56,409 --> 0:3:2,61
You read the books on genetics and you understand
that pills can make a person feel more in


27
0:3:2,61 --> 0:3:10,209
equilibrium. Is the chemistry of the body
in equilibrium? If you're depressed, yes.


28
0:3:10,209 --> 0:3:16,6
Your digestive system stops..alot of other
things manifest themselves,....but if you


29
0:3:16,6 --> 0:3:22,519
feel positive about what you're doing. If
you're sawing a tree down and uh "I HATE to


30
0:3:22,519 --> 0:3:29,879
do this!" Well you poison yourself. Do you
understand what I mean? Anything you do that


31
0:3:29,879 --> 0:3:35,19
you don't like..but if you say, "I have to
repair that model or clean it and that's going


32
0:3:35,19 --> 0:3:41,189
to take about two and a half hours." It depends
on your predictability. If it takes 5 hours,


33
0:3:41,189 --> 0:3:48,65
you might be disappointed. Not in the vision!.
Not in the uh thing...in your estimation!


34
0:3:48,65 --> 0:3:53,9
Do you understand? It's your own estimation.
If you figure it should take you three days


35
0:3:53,9 --> 0:3:59,84
to do a given job. If it takes twenty-three
days, you may get disappointed. Say, "I don't


36
0:3:59,84 --> 0:4:6,459
know how long it'll take but I'm gonna check
it out." and you do a certain amount of work


37
0:4:6,459 --> 0:4:12,239
and you predict the next and if it comes close,
you can use that method of predictability.


38
0:4:12,239 --> 0:4:18,979
Is there anything..did you get this message?
This is how you deal with depressed people...and


39
0:4:18,979 --> 0:4:25,729
that's what depression is...unless you have
further questions....Put it out there let's


40
0:4:25,729 --> 0:4:36,139
see how it works. If you get a response saying,
"You know that really helped alot.." Psychiatrist


41
0:4:36,139 --> 0:4:41,419
don't even know what the question is. They
think some people are depressed and others


42
0:4:41,419 --> 0:4:48,55
aren't...and some are 'happy go lucky' no
matter what. They have a self-image even though


43
0:4:48,55 --> 0:4:55,35
it's false. If you feel/..if you're a minister
and you administer to people's problems and


44
0:4:55,35 --> 0:5:0,259
they feel good about it, you feel you're doing
something useful. There are ministers that


45
0:5:0,259 --> 0:5:7,58
feel that they're administering to human need..and
as long as that person says, "God Bless you.


46
0:5:7,58 --> 0:5:13,85
Thank you. You've helped me alot." Whatever
the minister did helped them..but if the minister


47
0:5:13,85 --> 0:5:20,39
was an operational linguist and he helped
them to understand what they're are going


48
0:5:20,39 --> 0:5:24,0
through and why people get depressed, I think
that's better than comforting them and saying,


49
0:5:24,0 --> 0:5:30,789
"You'll pull out of it, I have every/..confidence
that you will." Well, if your minister says


50
0:5:30,789 --> 0:5:40,21
that, there may be a basis for it... but it's
not real. Knowing the difference is a problem.


51
0:5:40,21 --> 0:5:47,24
"Just/.." Well the Tea Party is a group of
people that believe in the structure of this


52
0:5:47,24 --> 0:5:56,24
economic system. Why? Because they're successful
in it. A military man that's awarded a higher


53
0:5:56,24 --> 0:6:4,25
position, if he gets to be captin or lieutanant
colonel, he gets reward for it...so he feels


54
0:6:4,25 --> 0:6:10,169
very proud. The more merit badget he has,
the greater he feels. If the Nazi has more


55
0:6:10,169 --> 0:6:16,33
merit badges, the Jew don't feel too good
about that but the Nazi feels great about


56
0:6:16,33 --> 0:6:25,319
it. Do you understand? So, "What is a reinforcer?"
Whatever the hell reinforces people. Except


57
0:6:25,319 --> 0:6:32,28
alcohol. That's a dependency that makes you
feel like you don't/...you lose your identity


58
0:6:32,28 --> 0:6:36,819
under alcohol. Say, "Did I say that when I
was drunk?" cuz you don't even know what you


59
0:6:36,819 --> 0:6:47,83
said. That means you don't have your own identity.
Identity means, "Fresco likes to walk in the


60
0:6:47,83 --> 0:6:55,569
Sun. He likes to make things. He likes to
talk to people about their problems..but he


61
0:6:55,569 --> 0:7:2,83
feels that/..." If i share the tools I have
and say, "Keep coming to me." and uh, and


62
0:7:2,83 --> 0:7:10,569
I never give them my tools, I do not help
them..really. Unless I have them the tools


63
0:7:10,569 --> 0:7:18,55
that I have. The same tools that enables me
to solve a problem..okay... but I'd rather


64
0:7:18,55 --> 0:7:26,47
not give these tools out because I'm afraid
of the culture. They'll commercialize on it,


65
0:7:26,47 --> 0:7:32,66
use it, and../ but they won't change the way
people think about things. Not only depression,


66
0:7:32,66 --> 0:7:43,19
I try to change the way people think about
most/.. everything. Now if you don't understand


67
0:7:43,19 --> 0:7:50,569
what I'm saying...you might even HATE what
I'm saying. I'll say, "That doesn't answer


68
0:7:50,569 --> 0:7:53,169
the question." Roxanne: "I remember in your
old lectures you use to tell people to write


69
0:7:53,169 --> 0:7:56,87
a list when you're not/..when you're feeling
better, when you're not depressed. Write a


70
0:7:56,87 --> 0:8:2,5
list of all the things you like to do....all
the things you don't like to do and then when


71
0:8:2,5 --> 0:8:6,74
you're depressed, look at the list and just
do those things that you like to do." Yeah,


72
0:8:6,74 --> 0:8:11,12
when you're depressed, you don't feel like
doing it. Roxanne: "But you used to use that


73
0:8:11,12 --> 0:8:17,37
as a tool. Didn't you?" Yeeeah. Well..I..it
worked at the time. All I can say is that


74
0:8:17,37 --> 0:8:22,11
I'm giving you the focal point of a depression.
LOSS OF SELF-IMAGE. "Who am I? Where am I


75
0:8:22,11 --> 0:8:29,3
going? What is my life about? I don't know.
I don't even know..if i'd be successful at


76
0:8:29,3 --> 0:8:34,97
anything." That's no self-image. You're always
successful at something. You can always teach


77
0:8:34,97 --> 0:8:42,82
somebody something. You're not totally a total
failure. If a person comes to me and says


78
0:8:42,82 --> 0:8:48,47
I'm depressed, that's better..if they come
here. Well I give them a social awareness


79
0:8:48,47 --> 0:8:56,38
that futbol is really a little spot in entertainment
but when you inform people, it changes alot


80
0:8:56,38 --> 0:9:2,3
of things. See, futbol just makes the game
pleasant but if you lose, you're depressed..


81
0:9:2,3 --> 0:9:12,7
and they get into fights alot. I don't know
if you know that...all over the world. So,


82
0:9:12,7 --> 0:9:12,75
it isn't a good thing. No competitive sport
is. When a guy hits a golf ball..ball and


83
0:9:12,75 --> 0:9:15,78
it misses, he throws the stick down on the
ground. The puck? Is that what you call it?


84
0:9:15,78 --> 0:9:25,67
He throws it on the ground and he feels bad..and
when the audience applauds when he hits it


85
0:9:25,67 --> 0:9:30,2
and it goes into the hole they applaud. Makes
him feel good..he has a self-image.. but if


86
0:9:30,2 --> 0:9:36,7
he hits it and it and it doesn't go into the
hole..the audience just looks on, and they


87
0:9:36,7 --> 0:9:44,34
don't reinforce him. So, if I designed a MAGNETIC
SYSTEM in the hole, and a STEEL BALL in the


88
0:9:44,34 --> 0:9:49,66
golf..even if he missed it...it would be going
into the hole. You know? What do you want?


89
0:9:49,66 --> 0:9:55,5
It's such a ridiculous game...of hitting a
golf ball and looking for it. What? It's a


90
0:9:55,5 --> 0:10:1,6
ridiculous game...or racing cars around in
a circle. If you get your kicks out of that,


91
0:10:1,6 --> 0:10:5,4
it's because you have a low self-image..and
you love it when the audience says, "You won


92
0:10:5,4 --> 0:10:17,54
that race. You did a beautiful job!" You know..that
is a, uh, a moment in time..but the things


93
0:10:17,54 --> 0:10:26,53
we are working on are...are everything. The
games of the future. Things of that sort.


94
0:10:26,53 --> 0:10:32,7
Now a game of the future.. typical game of
the future is not made by people who make


95
0:10:32,7 --> 0:10:38,91
games. They would be like this: There'd be
a map and then.. you would find out which


96
0:10:38,91 --> 0:10:44,9
state has the most cancer and you put these
little beads there and the other states that


97
0:10:44,9 --> 0:10:48,73
has the least amount of cancer... and you
know when you're through playing the game,


98
0:10:48,73 --> 0:10:54,78
you'd know what the hell exist in America.
You'd know the states with the highest divorce


99
0:10:54,78 --> 0:11:2,14
rate, the highest crime rate, where there's
more poverty. If you find out that poverty


100
0:11:2,14 --> 0:11:12,42
encourages abhorrent behavior then if you
don't want to do anything about it, you don't


101
0:11:12,42 --> 0:11:16,54
understand that problem. If you give a working
man a little above the standard of living


102
0:11:16,54 --> 0:11:24,2
so he can buy a television set, a radio, a
cell phone. If you just give him enough to


103
0:11:24,2 --> 0:11:30,64
live on, you don't build a study person, a
loyal person. If a person has a little more


104
0:11:30,64 --> 0:11:35,14
than they need, they'll come back to work.
If you give them more than they need, they


105
0:11:35,14 --> 0:11:43,87
won't show up. So the money system kills incentive
to go to work. So people say, "Fuck it. I'm


106
0:11:43,87 --> 0:11:49,6
not going in/. I'm going to call in sick."
Did you ever hear of that? So they call in


107
0:11:49,6 --> 0:11:54,53
sick... but that isn't the answer. "You should
be obedient to your corporation." That..that's


108
0:11:54,53 --> 0:12:6,33
a control device. You know. "I love my company."
If you love your company, that's no self-image


109
0:12:6,33 --> 0:12:13,73
at all. The union has a self-image. They'd
like to see the company succeed but they'd


110
0:12:13,73 --> 0:12:19,89
like a piece of the action. So instead of
making $18 a week, they go on strike and they


111
0:12:19,89 --> 0:12:26,91
get $25 a week... but the company loses the
competitive edge... because they have to raise


112
0:12:26,91 --> 0:12:33,39
the price of their product. So they HATE unions
because it lowers their standard of living.


113
0:12:33,39 --> 0:12:40,24
The unions love unions, the members, it raises
their standard of living. Everybody is right...


114
0:12:40,24 --> 0:12:46,1
that's the trouble with the world but nobody
knows what to do. Nobody wants to give up


115
0:12:46,1 --> 0:12:52,99
their position of advantage. I don't know
how much of this your'e going to stick out


116
0:12:52,99 --> 0:14:52,99
there but... okay. Take it from here.
