0:0:8,619 --> 0:0:11,749
This is a story about a world of obsessed with stuff.


2
0:0:11,749 --> 0:0:16,529
It's a story about a system in crisis.
We're trashing the planet,


3
0:0:16,529 --> 0:0:19,999
we're trashing each other, 
and we're not even having fun.


4
0:0:19,999 --> 0:0:22,8
the good thing is that when we
start to understand the system


5
0:0:22,8 --> 0:0:37,26
we start to see lots of places to step
in and turn these problems into solutions


6
0:0:37,26 --> 0:0:39,62
The other day, I couldn’t find my computer charger. 


7
0:0:39,62 --> 0:0:43,52
My computer is my lifeline 
to my work, my friends, my music.


8
0:0:43,52 --> 0:0:44,82
So I looked everywhere, 


9
0:0:44,82 --> 0:0:46,429
even in that drawer where this lives. 


10
0:0:46,429 --> 0:0:49,15
I know you have one too, a tangle of old chargers, 


11
0:0:49,15 --> 0:0:52,34
the sad remains of electronics past. 


12
0:0:52,34 --> 0:0:54,28
How did I end up with so many of these things? 


13
0:0:54,28 --> 0:0:56,75
It’s not like I’m always after the latest gadget. 


14
0:0:56,75 --> 0:1:0,5
My old devices broke or became so 
obsolete I couldn’t use them anymore. 


15
0:1:0,5 --> 0:1:4,12
And not one of these old chargers fits my computer.


16
0:1:4,12 --> 0:1:5,81
Augh. This isn’t just bad luck.


17
0:1:5,81 --> 0:1:7,179
It’s bad design. 


18
0:1:7,179 --> 0:1:11,0
I call it “designed for the dump.” 


19
0:1:11,0 --> 0:1:12,62
“Designed for the dump” sounds crazy, right? 


20
0:1:12,62 --> 0:1:16,9
But when you’re trying to sell lots of stuff, 
it makes perfect sense. 


21
0:1:16,9 --> 0:1:16,89
It’s a key strategy 


22
0:1:16,89 --> 0:1:19,53
of the companies that make our electronics. 


23
0:1:19,53 --> 0:1:24,65
In fact it’s a key part of our whole 
unsustainable materials economy. 


24
0:1:24,65 --> 0:1:27,72
Designed for the dump means 
making stuff to be thrown away quickly.


25
0:1:27,72 --> 0:1:32,4
Today’s electronics are hard to upgrade, 
easy to break, and impractical to repair. 


26
0:1:32,4 --> 0:1:35,65
My DVD player broke and I took it to a shop to get fixed.


27
0:1:35,65 --> 0:1:38,289
The repair guy wanted $50 just to look at it!


28
0:1:38,289 --> 0:1:42,42
A new one at Target costs $39.


29
0:1:42,42 --> 0:1:47,61
In the 1960s, Gordon Moore, 
the giant brain and semiconductor pioneer, 


30
0:1:47,61 --> 0:1:49,96
predicted that electronics designers could double


31
0:1:49,96 --> 0:1:51,89
processor speed every 18 months.


32
0:1:51,89 --> 0:1:53,799
So far he’s been right.


33
0:1:53,799 --> 0:1:55,7
This is called Moore’s Law.


34
0:1:55,7 --> 0:1:59,82
But somehow the bosses of these 
genius designers got it all twisted up. 


35
0:1:59,82 --> 0:2:4,35
They seem to think Moore’s Law means every 
18 months we have to throw out our old electronics


36
0:2:4,35 --> 0:2:11,659
and buy more. 
 
0:02:06.900,0:02:07.289
Problem is,
 
0:02:07.289,0:02:11.659
the 18 months that we use these things 
are just a blip in their entire lifecycle.


37
0:2:11,659 --> 0:2:15,4
And that’s where these dump designers 
aren’t just causing a pain in our wallets.


38
0:2:15,4 --> 0:2:18,629
They’re creating a global toxic emergency! 


39
0:2:18,629 --> 0:2:21,909
See, electronics start where most stuff starts,
in mines and factories. 


40
0:2:21,909 --> 0:2:25,61
Many of our gadgets are made from 
more than 1,000 different materials, 


41
0:2:25,61 --> 0:2:30,769
shipped from around the world to assembly plants. 
There, workers turn them into products, 


42
0:2:30,769 --> 0:2:36,639
using loads of toxic chemicals, like PVC, 
mercury, solvents and flame retardants. 


43
0:2:36,639 --> 0:2:40,7
Today this usually happens in far 
off places that are hard to monitor. 


44
0:2:40,7 --> 0:2:42,71
But it used to happen near my home, in Silicon Valley,


45
0:2:42,71 --> 0:2:46,56
which thanks to the electronics industry 
is one of the most poisoned communities


46
0:2:46,56 --> 0:2:47,929
in the U.S.


47
0:2:47,929 --> 0:2:52,72
IBM’s own data revealed that its workers making 
computer chips had 40% more miscarriages 


48
0:2:52,72 --> 0:2:57,229
and were significantly more likely to die from blood, 
brain and kidney cancer.


49
0:2:57,229 --> 0:3:0,49
The same thing is starting to happen all around the world.


50
0:3:0,49 --> 0:3:5,169
Turns out the high tech industry 
isn’t as clean as its image.


51
0:3:5,169 --> 0:3:8,48
So, after its toxic trip around the globe, 
the gadget lands in my hands.


52
0:3:8,48 --> 0:3:12,87
I love it for a year or so and 
then it starts drifting further 


53
0:3:12,87 --> 0:3:14,339
from its place of honor on my desk or in my pocket. 


54
0:3:14,339 --> 0:3:17,36
Maybe it spends a little time in my garage 


55
0:3:17,36 --> 0:3:18,29
before being tossed out.


56
0:3:18,29 --> 0:3:20,209
And that brings us to disposal, 


57
0:3:20,209 --> 0:3:22,659
which we think of as the end of its life.


58
0:3:22,659 --> 0:3:27,469
But really it’s just moved on to become part 
of the mountains of e-waste we make every year. 


59
0:3:27,469 --> 0:3:32,769
Remember how these devices were packed with toxic chemicals? 
Well there’s a simple rule of production: 


60
0:3:32,769 --> 0:3:34,959
toxics in, toxics out. 


61
0:3:34,959 --> 0:3:39,599
Computers, cell phones, TVs, all this stuff, 
is just waiting to release all their toxics 


62
0:3:39,599 --> 0:3:40,829
when we throw them away. 


63
0:3:40,829 --> 0:3:44,559
Some of them are slowly releasing this 
stuff even while we’re using them. 


64
0:3:44,559 --> 0:3:49,129
You know those fat, old TVs that people are 
chucking for high-def flat screens? 


65
0:3:49,129 --> 0:3:55,39
They each have about 5 pounds of lead in them. 
Lead! As in lead poisoning! 


66
0:3:55,39 --> 0:3:59,889
So almost all this e-waste either goes from my garage 
to a landfill or it gets shipped overseas to the garage 


67
0:3:59,889 --> 0:4:3,629
workshop of some guy in Guiyu, China 
whose job it is to recycle it. 


68
0:4:3,629 --> 0:4:7,309
I’ve visited a bunch of these 
so-called recycling operations.


69
0:4:7,309 --> 0:4:11,849
Workers, without protective gear, sit on the ground, 
smashing open electronics to recover the valuable 


70
0:4:11,849 --> 0:4:15,939
metals inside and chucking or burning 
the parts no one will pay them for. 


71
0:4:15,939 --> 0:4:17,81
So while I’m on to my next gadget, 


72
0:4:17,81 --> 0:4:19,229
my last gadget is off 


73
0:4:19,229 --> 0:4:22,529
poisoning families in Guiyu or India or Nigeria. 


74
0:4:22,529 --> 0:4:25,25
Each year we make 25 million tonnes of e-waste 


75
0:4:25,25 --> 0:4:28,9
which gets dumped, burned or recycled. 


76
0:4:28,9 --> 0:4:31,159
And that recycling is anything but green. 


77
0:4:31,159 --> 0:4:36,94
So are the geniuses who design these electronics actually...
evil geniuses? I don’t think so, 


78
0:4:36,94 --> 0:4:41,52
because the problems they’re creating
are well hidden even from them. 


79
0:4:41,52 --> 0:4:42,78
You see, the companies they work


80
0:4:42,78 --> 0:4:46,819
for keep these human and environmental costs 
out of sight and off their accounting books. 


81
0:4:46,819 --> 0:4:50,71
It’s all about externalizing the true costs of production. 


82
0:4:50,71 --> 0:4:55,86
Instead of companies paying to make their facilities 
safe the workers pay with their health. 


83
0:4:55,86 --> 0:5:2,39
Instead of them paying to redesign using less toxics 
villagers pay by losing their clean drinking water. 


84
0:5:2,39 --> 0:5:5,509
Externalizing costs allows companies to keep 
designing for the dump – 


85
0:5:5,509 --> 0:5:8,379
they get the profits and everyone else pays. 


86
0:5:8,379 --> 0:5:12,3
When we go along with it, it’s like 
we’re looking at this toxic mess and saying to companies 


87
0:5:12,3 --> 0:5:14,26
“you made it, but we’ll deal with it.” 


88
0:5:14,26 --> 0:5:18,259
I’ve got a better idea. How about 
“you made it, you deal with it”? 


89
0:5:18,259 --> 0:5:20,599
Doesn’t that make more sense? 


90
0:5:20,599 --> 0:5:24,989
Imagine that instead of all this toxic e-waste piling up 


91
0:5:24,989 --> 0:5:26,439
in our garages and the streets of Guiyu, 


92
0:5:26,439 --> 0:5:29,62
we sent it to the garages of the CEOs who made it. 


93
0:5:29,62 --> 0:5:33,65
You can bet that they’d be on the phone 
to their designers demanding they 


94
0:5:33,65 --> 0:5:35,499
stop designing for the dump. 


95
0:5:35,499 --> 0:5:40,21
Making companies deal with their e-waste is called 
Extended Producer Responsibility 


96
0:5:40,21 --> 0:5:42,159
or Product Takeback. 


97
0:5:42,159 --> 0:5:44,449
If all these old gadgets were their problem, 


98
0:5:44,449 --> 0:5:48,46
it would be cheaper for them to just design 
longer lasting, less toxic, 


99
0:5:48,46 --> 0:5:50,39
and more recyclable products in the first place. 


100
0:5:50,39 --> 0:5:54,129
They could even make them modular, 
so that when one part broke, 


101
0:5:54,129 --> 0:5:59,409
they could just send us a new piece, 
instead of taking back the whole broken mess.


102
0:5:59,409 --> 0:6:2,65
Already takeback laws are popping 
up all over Europe and Asia.


103
0:6:2,65 --> 0:6:6,11
In the U.S. many cities and states 
are passing similar laws –


104
0:6:6,11 --> 0:6:9,9
these need to be protected and strengthened. 


105
0:6:9,9 --> 0:6:11,289
It’s time to get these brainiacs working on our side. 


106
0:6:11,289 --> 0:6:14,71
With takeback laws and citizen action 
to demand greener products, 


107
0:6:14,71 --> 0:6:19,539
we are starting a race to the top, 
where designers compete to make long-lasting, 


108
0:6:19,539 --> 0:6:21,719
toxic-free products. 


109
0:6:21,719 --> 0:6:23,37
So, let’s have a green Moore’s law. 


110
0:6:23,37 --> 0:6:24,4
How about: 


111
0:6:24,4 --> 0:6:27,379
the use of toxic chemicals will be 
cut in half every 18 months? 


112
0:6:27,379 --> 0:6:31,209
The number of workers poisoned will 
decline at an even faster rate? 


113
0:6:31,209 --> 0:6:35,18
We need to give these designers a challenge 
they can rise to and do what they do best – 


114
0:6:35,18 --> 0:6:36,469
innovate. 


115
0:6:36,469 --> 0:6:39,81
Already, some of them are realizing 
they’re too smart to be dump designers 


116
0:6:39,81 --> 0:6:44,369
and are figuring out how to make computers 
without PVC or toxic flame retardants. 


117
0:6:44,369 --> 0:6:45,659
Good job guys. 


118
0:6:45,659 --> 0:6:47,509
But we can do even more. 


119
0:6:47,509 --> 0:6:49,53
When we take our e-waste to recyclers, 


120
0:6:49,53 --> 0:6:52,669
we can make sure they don’t 
export it to developing countries. 


121
0:6:52,669 --> 0:6:56,71
And when we do need to buy new gadgets, 
we can choose greener products. 


122
0:6:56,71 --> 0:7:0,509
But the truth is: 
we are never going to just shop our way out of this problem 


123
0:7:0,509 --> 0:7:4,6
because the choices available to us at the store 
are limited by choices of designers 


124
0:7:4,6 --> 0:7:9,32
and policymakers outside of the store. 
That’s why we need to join with others to demand 


125
0:7:9,32 --> 0:7:13,419
stronger laws on toxic chemicals 
and on banning e-waste exports. 


126
0:7:13,419 --> 0:7:17,219
There are billions of people out there who want 
access to the incredible web of information 


127
0:7:17,219 --> 0:7:19,61
and entertainment electronics offer. 


128
0:7:19,61 --> 0:7:21,469
But it’s the access they want, 


129
0:7:21,469 --> 0:7:23,479
not all that toxic garbage. 


130
0:7:23,479 --> 0:7:27,699
So let’s get our brains working on 
sending that old design for the


131
0:7:27,699 --> 0:7:29,449
dump mentality to the dump where it belongs and instead 


132
0:7:29,449 --> 0:9:29,449
building an electronics industry 
and a global society that’s designed to last.
