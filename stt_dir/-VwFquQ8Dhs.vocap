###3 <i>The human brain is remarkable,</i>
###5 <i>For nine years</i> <i>I thought I'd lost my watch</i>
###8 <i>cos I can't remember</i> <i>which wrist it's on,</i>
###10 <i>And yet after two weeks</i>
###12 <i>the things that scared me at first</i> <i>catheters chest tubes IVs,,,</i>
###18 <i>Everything has started to click,</i>
###81 Are you? lf you have time to listen to music,
###85 then l assume you have time to finish your paperwork.
###97 Keep moving.
###119 <i>That work day</i> <i>started like every other,</i>
###126 - How's it goin'? - l'm a 37-year-old janitor.
###130 How d'you think it's going?
###132 There is nothing wrong with being a janitor.
###135 Really? Thank you, you've turned my life around.
###139 l'll tell my janitor wife and all our janitor kids that life is worth living.
###144 And that comes straight from our hero, Dr Whozits, Dr Nothing.
###148 No, seriously, come on.
###150 Come over to my humble house and point out things that are cheap.
###154 <i>Luckily I had the night off to regroup,</i>
###159 - That dog is creepy. - Be nice to Rowdy.
###163 The guy we bought him from kept him in a box full of old hats.
###169 Why is she here all the time?
###171 - Just give her a chance, man. - You want to hit that.
###176 - No! - Yeah!
###178 She's just a friend.
###180 lt's healthy, hanging out with a girl without the ultimate goal being sex.
###185 - You know? - l'm not following.
###191 Creepy. l had a run-in with that nurse, Carla.
###194 She forgot to check the stats on a patient and gave me attitude.
###198 Did you tell on her?
###200 - Who's responsible for this? - She is.
###204 l don't remember. Why do you assume it was my fault?
###208 <i>It'd be a good point except Elliot</i> <i>puts her foot in her mouth,</i>
###212 <i>A lot,</i> <i>She can't really seem to stop,</i>
###214 Just because l occasionally say something stupid doesn't mean
###218 l go door-to-door annoying people, like some crazed Jehovah's Witness.
###224 - You're not? - No.
###227 My mother is.
###230 He's black, too. You should tease him about that.
###233 <i>I'm doing better with new people,</i> <i>Like Carla for instance,</i>
###238 Bambi, that blonde stick you hang out with? Tell her...
###245 You might have to write that down for me.
###247 <i>And Dr Cox, We've really connected,</i> <i>I'm kind of like his protégé,</i>
###251 - l need to see his chart... - Done, copied and highlighted.
###255 Unfortunately, radar, l'm fresh out of gold stars.
###260 Multilobar pneumonia at 31 . How much does he smoke?
###263 l don't know.
###264 lt's your attention to detail that impresses me most.
###269 - How many packs a day, genius? - Half a pack.
###272 l'm sorry. l phrased the question wrong.
###275 How many packs a day, really?
###278 Eleven.
###280 You don't know where l'm coming from.
###282 Two or three packs.
###285 Let's hear it.
###287 l don't smoke so... Zero packs.
###292 What tests have you ordered?
###294 l was just... l was totally kidding with you.
###297 He was. We're all in on it.
###299 <i>I like Will, That makes this harder,</i>
###303 l ordered blood cultures and a high-resolution CT.
###306 What are you looking for?
###310 Cancer.
###311 <i>When you say ''cancer ''</i> <i>every person reacts the same way,</i>
###315 - Excellent. - <i>Not like that,</i>
###320 <i>There it is,</i>
###322 <i>I never know what to say to</i> <i>Turk's buddies, But I'm getting better,</i>
###326 So...
###328 - How's surgery? - lt rocks.
###331 But my bedroom, that's where l really operate. Am l right?
###336 - Come on, show Todd some love! - <i>I hate showing Todd love,</i>
###342 Bambi, why are you slumming with these scalpel jocks?
###345 Please, baby. This here's the VlP table.
###349 Why don't you sit your fine self down?
###353 ''Baby, this here's the VlP table...''
###357 l'm not really interested in her.
###359 Then the Todd'll show that little biscuit some love.
###367 <i>Maybe he's a bit interested,</i>
###369 Fine. Todd'll show himself some love.
###375 l'm going to ask Carla out.
###378 - l think the janitor's out to get me. - Thank you so much for your help.
###382 Why not be a bit more paranoid?
###384 - Wait, Turk... - That's him.
###392 Hi, how are you?
###396 l need David Farr's chart.
###399 We all need lots of things.
###401 Great. Dr Kelso? You're the Chief of Medicine.
###404 ls there a special way to communicate with nursing staff?
###408 Sugar won't work. They're already so sweet.
###414 Now, listen, Dr Whatever-the-hell-your-name-is,
###417 you tattled yesterday, l responded.
###419 l feel closer to you than ever. But the ramifications are yours.
###423 Don't drag me into your pathetic, whiny, little squabble
###427 with that bunch of malcontents. l hope you all kill each other.
###431 Have a great day, ladies.
###437 l hate this place.
###439 Dr Cox, l got Will's CT results back.
###442 No cancer. So what shall l tell him?
###445 l'd open with that.
###446 He's headed down such a bad road, maybe we could talk to him...
###450 <i>When you have a mentor you understand</i> <i>the meaning behind their words,</i>
###454 - You do whatever you want. - <i>Means ''Great idea'',</i>
###457 l'm just happy you haven't messed up yet today.
###460 <i>Means ''You're really</i> <i>coming along as a doctor'',</i>
###463 - Don't ever touch me. - <i>Means ''Don't ever touch him'',</i>
###469 Just thought it was a nice moment.
###473 - l don't wanna. - Come on.
###479 Carla, l shouldn't have told Dr Kelso on you.
###483 No, you shouldn't have.
###487 <i>Comfortable silences,</i>
###489 But thank you for apologising.
###493 Good.
###495 - l wanna make one thing clear. - Nothing needs to be clear.
###499 l still think you were in the wrong.
###502 Checking orthostatics is your job. l need to know you'll take care of it.
###507 That's all l'm saying.
###511 There. All better.
###515 As of now, you have no signs of cancer.
###518 Who rules? Will rules.
###521 This isn't great news.
###523 Are you sure? That's how it first hit me.
###526 You're on a slippery slope.
###528 <i>I had to scare him but</i> <i>I sensed he'd heard it before,</i>
###531 <i>Part of being a doctor</i> <i>is your ability to improvise,</i>
###534 Right now, the one thing l want you to think about...
###539 <i>How would you like to sound like this?</i>
###542 Let me see.
###547 - <i>This is so cool,</i> - No, it's not.
###549 - <i>Biddy biddy biddy,</i> - lt's not a toy.
###554 <i>Would you like to play a game?</i>
###556 <i>Sometimes</i> <i>if all you have is old words</i>
###559 <i>all you can do is</i> <i>hope they say something new,</i>
###562 Look, man. You're a great patient.
###565 l like you enough to hope l never see you again.
###568 But if you keep smoking, you'll be back here.
###572 l bet my own life on that.
###578 <i>Dr Reid to Room 402 then down</i> <i>to 20 1 then back up to Room 403,</i>
###591 l'm nervous, man.
###593 l'm your wing man. l will not leave your side.
###596 - Hey, baby. - Keep moving, frat boy.
###600 - Come on. Out with it. - Don't rush me.
###605 l mean...
###606 You shouldn't be impatient with the opportunity of a lifetime.
###612 l'm gonna sit down because you're so sexy? My knees are weak.
###618 Really?
###619 Dr Cox? l know l'm being annoying,
###621 but l'm getting used to talking to patients.
###624 This is why l became a doctor, right?
###627 l heard, ''l know l'm being annoying'' and then white noise.
###630 Will, l got him to quit smoking.
###633 For ever? No last one? The last ones are better than sex.
###636 Trust me, l've had 1 ,000 of them.
###639 Done forever, he swore to me. l reached him. l reached him.
###649 You're having a big day, there, Susan.
###656 Private party.
###664 <i>Gotta get right back on the horse,</i>
###667 - Dr Cox, about Will. - Not now!
###669 l've a 1 0-minute break and my soap is on.
###672 Hey, Skeech, if you go ahead and change the channels,
###676 l swear l'll suture your hands together.
###679 - Right. So with Will... - This woman is just fantastic.
###683 The breasts are probably fake but by God, those tears are real.
###687 <i>Time for a bold move,</i>
###695 How are we gonna fix this Will thing?
###698 Do you know what you've just done?
###701 You just lost all lapdog privileges.
###703 - Excuse me? - No more walkies, no more treats,
###706 no more following me around.
###708 - l'm not your lapdog. - You back there.
###711 What do we do with lapdogs who can't behave in the house?
###714 Make them stay outside?
###716 You have five seconds to get out of this room,
###719 or l'm gonna start whacking you on the nose with this.
###722 Don't laugh, this isn't a joke. Get out.
###725 - But l was thinking... - Go!
###732 What do you want to watch?
###734 - <i>Days of our Lives?</i> - Attaboy.
###739 Come in.
###744 He smells the food.
###747 Move your butt.
###750 Peace offering?
###753 l know l don't always make the best first impression.
###757 Or second, for that matter.
###760 l'd like us to be friends. l thought l could get to know you a bit better.
###765 See what you're about.
###768 For instance, when did you meet Morgan Freeman?
###771 That's my mom.
###775 l like her freckles.
###780 Rowdy, no!
###783 l can't figure out why Dr Cox tore me a new one today.
###786 Enough already! He's a jerk.
###789 - He's a jerk. - He's a jerk.
###792 - He's a jerk. - You're a jerk.
###794 He's just Dr Cox. He's always like that.
###797 Who really knows him? Who does he hang out with?
###800 - No one. - <i>That must be lonely,</i>
###803 ''Take two Turks as needed, apply to sensitive areas...''
###806 Who wrote this?
###808 Whassup?
###813 Come on, Carla. Give me one good reason why you won't go out with me.
###818 You're a surgeon, so you got the God complex,
###821 the ''married to the job'' thing.
###823 You're cute, but you're very aware of it.
###826 You've no idea what l'm like, so your feelings for me come from down there.
###830 But most of all, l'm looking for the real thing.
###833 You're nothing but a little boy who's not used to being told ''No''.
###837 So there's a bunch of reasons. Pick your favourite.
###841 l'd go with the God complex.
###844 But it's hard to choose. They're all so good.
###847 <i>A hospital is a tricky place,</i>
###849 <i>It's very cliquey</i> <i>and you have to watch what you say,</i>
###852 <i>It's a lot like high school,</i>
###877 <i>If I didn't have</i> <i>somewhere else to be</i>
###879 <i>I would have gone</i> <i>and sat with her,</i>
###884 <i>But tonight there's somebody</i> <i>else I have to take care of,</i>
###893 l know watching Will kill himself hurts you, too.
###896 lt's harder if you have no one to talk with.
###899 So l figured l'd pick up a few cold ones, right?
###902 And you and l, we'll talk it out, we'll just break the whole thing down.
###906 Right? What do you say to that?
###912 Everyone keeps ignoring me. l'm like a plague around here.
###917 Don't look at me when you're talking.
###919 Dr Reid. l just wanted to say, you're out of my doghouse.
###923 That was a great catch on that patient with meningococcus.
###927 That actually wasn't me. Carla noticed the rash on his legs.
###931 You could have been back into my good graces
###934 and instead you passed the credit on to a nurse.
###937 How noble. l tell you what, l'll get the cafeteria staff to write
###942 ''Was it worth it?'' on a big cake for you.
###946 ''...station''. This is the nurses' station.
###953 - Do you think l've damaged ligaments? - l don't care.
###958 Now, can l count on you to never drop by here again?
###962 Or shall l just move?
###964 You can't leave a place with this much warmth.
###967 l especially love this shelf filled with photos of your friends and family.
###973 <i>If he comes at you</i> <i>just try and roll out the door,</i>
###976 Actually, you have a point.
###980 l guess watching the game by yourself with a Scotch
###984 isn't really the only way to watch a game.
###988 lt's just that... l've always thought of needing people as a sign of weakness.
###994 - lt's not. - Well, then...
###997 Would you stay and watch the game with me?
###1000 Maybe have a slice of pizza?
###1004 - Of course l will. - l can braid your hair.
###1008 l know the couch isn't very deep, but we could move the back cushion
###1012 and spoon.
###1016 Hey, you guys, what do you say? Beer and chips in the back.
###1019 Just ignore them.
###1021 Tell me the answer to this question.
###1024 Do you want to be the big spoon or the little spoon?
###1028 Kelso didn't ask her, she gave you full credit.
###1031 l don't care. Too little too late. Plus, l know why you're really here.
###1036 So l'm gonna plop myself right here in the VlP section,
###1040 so you can give me what you got.
###1043 l was gonna tell you how l busted JD's chops the other day
###1046 for wanting to be friends with a girl.
###1048 And now l find it so amazing to see how strong you are,
###1051 how well you carry yourself,
###1053 how l'd give anything to wake up and watch you read the paper.
###1058 But instead l think you should hop off your broom,
###1061 remember what it was like when you first started here
###1064 and give Elliot a break. Because she may be a chore but she is a good person.
###1072 And your ass is especially fine today.
###1075 Pick me up tomorrow at seven.
###1078 She's not the only one who can do a speech. l can do a speech.
###1082 Return that umbrella to me at the hospital. Not here. ls that clear?
###1088 And, Newbie...
###1091 - Know what your problem is? - My bones hurt?
###1093 You were gonna rescue me from loneliness with a $3 six-pack of light beer?
###1099 lt turns out we can't save people from themselves.
###1102 We just treat 'em. Treat that kid with a respiratory problem
###1106 and when he comes back with cancer, go ahead and treat that.
###1109 Thanks for the pick-me-up.
###1113 Smokers, drinkers, druggies, fatties, whatever.
###1116 lf you keep living and dying on whether or not a person changes, well...
###1124 You're not gonna make it as a doctor.
###1130 Now come here and give me a hug. lt's OK, come here.
###1135 Get outta here!
###1137 Take this piss water with you. lt's embarrassing.
###1140 - l'll drink it! - l'll take the beer. You'll beat it.
###1145 - You apologise. - No, l don't wanna.
###1147 OK, come on. Just do it really fast. Like a Band-Aid.
###1151 l wrote out the pharmacy renewals on all your patients.
###1155 Great. You know what else would be helpful?
###1161 <i>The one thing we never</i> <i>stop looking for is acceptance,</i>
###1164 - Thank you, Carla. - You're welcome.
###1166 <i>Acceptance of our own shortcomings,</i>
###1169 - So when's the baby due? - What baby?
###1172 <i>Acceptance that some things</i> <i>are gonna be what they're gonna be,</i>
###1176 This is a strange resort. The wheelchair service is great
###1179 but that suite l rented, there was another person in it.
###1182 - And the bellhop gave me an enema. - Yeah, he's new here.
###1189 So...
###1191 - Anything you wanna say? - You know it all, man.
###1197 <i>Still I hated Will a little</i>
###1199 <i>cos I looked at people</i> <i>who are important to me</i>
###1201 <i>in terms of what</i> <i>will probably kill them,</i>
###1204 <i>Heart disease,</i>
###1206 <i>Liver disease,</i>
###1208 <i>Somebody choking her,</i>
###1212 <i>I don't know,</i>
###1214 <i>Probably stress,</i>
###1221 - Say anything else to him? - No.
###1223 But you wanted to.
###1225 - You told me not to. - Would you be a man?
###1228 Stick to your convictions or you'll never make it as a doctor.
###1237 l can't believe your head exploded.
###1239 lf it does, you'll never make it as a doctor.
###1242 l mean, come on. You look ridiculous. �
