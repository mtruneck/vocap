###11 150 years ago,
###13 the business corporation was a relatively insignificant institution.
###18 Today it is all pervasive like the church, the monarchy
###21 and the communist party in other times and places;
###25 the corporation is today's dominant institution.
###29 This documentary examines the nature,
###32 evolution, impacts and possible future of
###35 the modern business corporation.
###38 And you should give them a narrow legal mandate
###42 what has allowed today’s corporation to achieve such extraordinary power
###45 and influence over our lives.
###48 The beginner inquiry scandals threaten to trigger a wide debate
###52 about the lack of control over big corporations.
###55 "I think there is an overhang..."
###60 "over the market of distrust..."
###64 "there is a 95%, 100%, a huge percentage of the business"
###69 "community are honest and reveal all of their assets,"
###72 "their compensation programs are robust"
###74 "but there are some bad apples."
###78 The media debate about the basic corporating principles
###81 of the corporate world was quickly reduced to a game to follow the leader.
###85 "I still happen to think the United States is the greatest place in the world to invest."
###88 "We have some shakes up that are going on because of a few bad apples."
###96 "Some people call me a bad apple,"
###101 "well, I may be bruised but I still taste sweet."
###106 "Some people call me a bad apple,"
###111 "but I may be the sweetest apple on the tree."
###114 "These are not just a bunch of bad apples!"
###117 "This is just a few bad apples!"
###120 "It's not just a few bad apples!"
###122 "We got to get rid of the bad apples! You can start with Tyco!"
###126 "Bad apples!"
###127 "We know all about WorldCom! - Bad apples!"
###129 "Xerox corporation! - Bad apples!"
###132 "Arthur Andersen. - Bad apples! ENRON obviously! - Bad apples!"
###135 "K-Mart Corporation!"
###137 "Their car is getting a little more full."
###139 "I don't think it's just a few apples unfortunately,"
###141 "I think this is the worst crisis of confidence in a business..."
###145 What's wrong with this picture?
###147 "Can we pick up a better metaphor to describe"
###151 the dominant institution of our time?
###154 Through the voices of CEOs, whistle blowers, brokers, gurus and spies,
###159 insiders and outsiders, they present the corporation as a paradox,
###164 an institution that creates great wealth but causes enormous
###167 and often hidden harms.
###185 I see the corporation as a part of the jigsaw in society as a whole,
###190 which if you remove it, the picture is incomplete
###194 but equally if it is the only part, it's not going to work.
###200 A sports team, some of us are blocking and tackling,
###203 some of us are running the ball, some of us are throwing the ball
###206 but we all have a common purpose which is to succeed as an organization.
###211 A corporation is like a family unit;
###213 people in the corporation work together for a common end.
###221 Like the telephone system, it reaches almost everywhere.
###225 It is extraordinarily powerful.
###227 It is pretty hard to avoid and it transforms the lives of people,
###232 I think, on balance for the better.
###237 "The eagle, soaring, clear eyed..."
###242 "competitive, prepared to strike but not a vulture..."
###247 "noble,  a visionary, majestic..."
###251 "that people can believe in and be inspired by;"
###254 "that creates such a lift that it soars."
###259 "I can see that being a good logo for the principal company."
###266 "Okay guys, enough bullshit!!"
###273 Corporations are artificial creations;
###277 you might say they are monsters trying to devour as much profit as possible
###283 at anyone's expense.
###287 I think of a whale, gentle, big fish
###291 which can swallow you in an instant.
###295 Doctor Frankenstein's creation has
###298 overwhelmed and overpowered him
###301 as the corporate form has done with us.
###314 "The word corporate gets attached in almost..."
###318 "you know, in a priority of sense to..."
###322 "and it gets married with the word agenda  and one hears a lot"
###326 "about the word corporate agenda as tough it is evil,"
###330 "as though it is an agenda which is trying to take over the world."
###336 "Personally, I don't use the word corporation,"
###339 I use the word business; I would use the word...
###345 "I use the word company. I'll use the word business community"
###348 "because I think that is a much fair representation"
###352 "than zeroing on just this word 'corporation'."
###363 "It is funny that I taught in the business school for as long as I have"
###366 "without ever having been asked so pointedly to say"
###370 "what I think a corporation is."
###372 It is one form of business ownership.
###377 It's a group of individuals working together to serve a variety
###382 of objectives the principle one of which is earning large,
###386 growing, sustained, legal returns
###389 for the people who own the business.
###393 Hi there, this is Mark Achbar,
###395 I produced and co-directed the corporation
###398 and this is the official shareware version of the film.
###401 I am proud of the fact that hundreds of thousands of people
###404 have already downloaded and shared this film.
###407 If I had a dollar for every download, well...,
###410 I probably wouldn't be making this appeal.
###413 More than 200 people worked on the film, the DVD, and the website
###416 over 8 years.  If you support the film,
###419 please support the filmmakers too.
###422 You can make a contribution, large or small,
###425 even a couple of bucks would help at www.thecorporation.com.
