###8 Far out in space, in the center of a seething cosmic maelstrom.
###18 Extreme heat. High velocities.
###26 Atoms tear, and space literally buckles.
###39 Photons fly out across the universe, energized to the limits found in nature.
###50 Billions of years later, they enter the detectors of spacecraft stationed above our atmosphere.
###61 Our ability to record them is part of a new age of high-energy astronomy, and a new age
###70 of insights into nature at its most extreme.
###75 What can we learn by witnessing the violent birth of a black hole?
###107 There have been times when our understanding of the universe has reached a standstill,
###113 when our grasp of the workings of time and space, the nature of matter and energy, do
###120 not fully square with what we observe.
###126 In those times, opposing world views cannot be resolved.
###134 So it was in the spring of 1920, when astronomers debated the scale of the universe.
###145 The scene was the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC.
###152 On one side was the astronomer Harlow Shapley, known for his groundbreaking work on the size
###157 of our galaxy and the position of the sun within it.
###164 Shapley described the galaxy as an island universe. As large as his measurements suggested
###171 it was, it might indeed be all there is.
###177 That included mysterious fuzzy shapes known as spiral nebulae. He argued they were merely
###184 gas clouds.
###188 On the opposing side, Heber Curtis argued that some nebulae were also island universes.
###195 That idea was not new.
###198 165 years earlier, the German philosopher Emmanuel Kant described the nebulae as galaxies
###206 unto themselves.
###207 “It is noted only in the Milky Way,” he said,” that whitish clouds are seen; several
###214 patches of similar aspect shine with faint light here and there throughout the aether,
###220 and if the telescope is turned upon any of these it confronts us with a tight mass of
###226 stars.”
###229 It took a new generation of powerful telescopes for astronomers to finally measure the distance
###234 to those mysterious objects.
###239 Within a few years after the Great Debate, Edwin Hubble reported data showing the spiral
###245 nebulae lay far beyond the Milky Way. That led to our current understanding of a universe
###252 billions of light years across, filled with galaxies, and expanding rapidly.
###262 In the years since, essential details about this dynamic universe have stubbornly resisted
###268 our inquiries. The deeper we dug into the nature of matter and energy, the more obscure
###277 they seemed to become.
###281 One of the deepest mysteries of all emerged in the 1960s.
###292 That was a time when nations were rapidly expanding and testing their nuclear arsenals.
###300 In 1963, the United States, Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom signed the Limited
###307 Test Ban Treaty, which prohibited above-ground nuclear testing.
###315 To verify compliance, the United States launched six pairs of satellites known as Vela, from
###322 the Spanish verb to watch over or keep vigil. They were designed to record a distinctive
###331 signal of nuclear explosions, called gamma rays.
###339 Gamma rays are an ultra high-energy form of electromagnetic radiation, a term used to
###345 describe particles called photons that travel out from an energy source.
###355 The lowest-energy form, radio, has a wavelength of up to 300 meters. Though we can’t see
###364 them, they are produced naturally, for example, in flashes of lightning.
###374 Our eyes are tuned to capture much smaller visible wavelengths down to 400 nanometers,
###380 or 400 billionths of a meter.
###386 Carrying even more energy, ultraviolet light has a wavelength as short as 10 nanometers.
###394 X-Rays, which penetrate soft tissue in our bodies, can be as short as one hundredth of
###401 a nanometer.
###406 Gamma rays carry so much energy that their wavelength can be less than 10 picometers.
###412 That’s below the diameter of an atom.
###419 They are known as “ionizing radiation,” which means heavy exposure can strip electrons
###426 from atoms in your body and kill you. Fortunately, gamma rays from space do not penetrate our
###442 atmosphere.
###445 Still, one theory says that a nearby gamma ray burst might have been responsible for
###452 a mass extinction 440 million years ago, by destroying Earth’s ozone layer and allowing
###459 in a flood of deadly ultraviolet radiation.
###469 Unlike lower-energy forms of electromagnetic radiation, gamma rays are produced by the
###474 often violent decay of atomic nuclei in nuclear reactions.
###484 On the hunt for clandestine nuclear tests, on July 2, 1967, the Vela 3 and Vela 4 satellites
###493 detected a flash of gamma radiation that was unlike a nuclear weapon.
###502 As additional Vela satellites were launched, a team at Los Alamos National Lab continued
###508 to find these mysterious bursts in their data. They were able to narrow the sky positions
###515 of sixteen, and to rule out a terrestrial or solar origin.
###524 It would take at least 30 years to figure out what they were.
###537 A year after the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990, the 17-ton Compton Gamma
###548 Ray Observatory was sent up, in part, to produce a comprehensive map of gamma ray bursts.
###557 Over a thousand detections showed the bursts were randomly spread across the sky. That
###564 led to another great debate, held in 1995, to stimulate fresh thinking on this long running
###571 mystery.
###575 Donald Lamb of the University of Chicago argued that they came from a recently discovered
###580 crop of neutron stars that had escaped into the halo of our galaxy.
###591 Bohdan Paczynski of Princeton University argued that their locations followed the general
###596 layout of galaxies and quasars.
###602 But at those distances, he conceded, the bursts would have to be the most luminous objects
###607 known in the universe.
###611 And yet a third of them disappear in less than two seconds. The rest die out within
###617 minutes.
###618 Were they stars flaring up within our cosmic neighborhood? Or were they something far more
###626 violent – and more fundamental to the workings of time and space?
###637 In the years that followed, a revolution would sweep the field of high-energy astronomy.
###644 The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched in 1997.
###652 It was followed by the gamma ray satellites Integral in 2002, and HETE-2 in 2003.
###664 The ultimate gamma ray hunter, Swift, was sent into orbit in 2004.
###671 With ultra-violet, x-ray, and gamma ray sensors, Swift’s goal was to pinpoint as many as
###677 100 gamma ray bursts per year, and to relay their locations down to earth within seconds.
###688 That would allow astronomers on the ground to quickly aim their telescopes at the source
###693 to capture the afterglow. That would allow them to measure its distance and to find clues
###700 to what caused it in the first place.
###707 Those clues began to appear in early 1997. An Italian satellite called Beppo Sax detected
###717 a burst and relayed its location to Earth.
###722 The Hubble Space Telescope captured this image of the fading afterglow, suggesting that it
###728 came from another galaxy beyond our own.
###735 Astronomers analyzed light captured by ground telescopes and found hints that it was associated
###740 with a supernova.
###745 The association with supernovae became stronger over time.
###751 A 1998 burst coincided with this supernova.
###756 A 2003 burst with this supernova.
###766 And a 2006 burst with this supernova.
###774 But these were no ordinary explosions. Scientists were struck by the amount of energy released,
###781 and by their extreme brightness.
###786 On March 19, 2008, astronomers recorded a burst that originated 7.5 billion light years
###794 away. And yet its afterglow was bright enough to be seen with the naked eye from Earth.
###807 That confirmed a long running suspicion: that the source was a narrow and extremely powerful
###813 beam of light. What astronomers saw was actually the impact of this beam as it passed through
###820 clouds of gas, heating them up to billions of degrees, and generating ultra high-energy
###827 gamma rays.
###831 Phenomena like this are not uncommon in our universe. You can find beams and high speed
###837 jets wherever matter falls rapidly into stars, galaxies, or black holes.
###846 Few of these are known to marshal as much power as a gamma ray burst.
###860 September 13, 2008. The Swift satellite recorded a burst with the power of 9000 supernovae,
###869 and a jet that was clocked at 99.9999% the speed of light.
###878 April 29, 2009 brought the second most distant object ever recorded. The journey of this
###891 Gamma Ray burst started 13.14 billion years ago.
###901 Astronomers have begun to see these beacons as probes for understanding the chemical evolution
###907 of the cosmos, going all the way back to when stars and galaxies were just beginning to
###913 form.
###919 But how does nature produce a beacon of light that can reach across the entire breadth of
###924 the visible universe?
###929 One team of scientists has been looking for answers close to home, in a giant galaxy some
###935 50 million light years away, known as M87.
###943 The Event Horizon Telescope links telescopes thousands of kilometers apart into a single
###949 giant instrument. The astronomers targeted sub-millimeter radio waves because they have
###958 just the right frequency to move through dust and gas in the core of M87.
###967 That galaxy has one of the largest black holes known, at 6.6 billion solar masses.
###975 The resolution of this system was enough to collect data on a region just outside the
###982 event horizon of the black hole, the point beyond which nothing can escape its gravitational
###987 pull.
###991 The scientists were able to see down to the base of a spectacular jet that blasts continuously
###997 out of M87’s core.
###1002 This region is held under the spell of extreme gravity.
###1009 Subject to what Albert Einstein called frame dragging, space and time are pulled along
###1015 on a path that leads into the black hole.
###1021 As gas, dust, stars or planets fall into the hole, they form into a disk that spirals in
###1028 with the flow of space time, reaching the speed of light just as it hits the event horizon.
###1032 The spinning motion of this so-called “accretion disk” can channel some of the inflowing
###1037 matter out into a pair of high-energy beams, or jets.
###1048 How a jet can form was shown in a supercomputer simulation of a short gamma ray burst.
###1057 It was based on a 40-millisecond long burst recorded by Swift on May 9, 2005. It took
###1062 five minutes for the afterglow to fade, but that was enough for astronomers to capture
###1065 crucial details.
###1067 It had come from a giant galaxy 2.6 billion light years away, filled with old stars.
###1078 Scientists suspected that this was a case of two dead stars falling into a catastrophic
###1084 embrace.
###1086 Orbiting each other, they moved ever closer, gradually gaining speed.
###1093 At the end of the line, they began tearing each other apart, until they finally merged.
###1102 NASA scientists simulated the final 35 thousandths of a second, when a black hole forms.
###1113 As the two objects move together, their mass is scrambled into a dense, hot cloud of swirling
###1120 debris, shown on the left side of the image.
###1123 On the right, are magnetic fields that spin up off this cloud. Blue represents magnetic
###1130 strength a billion times greater than that of the Sun.
###1138 These fields begin to channel a cloud of plasma that surrounds the newly formed black hole.
###1144 Chaos reigns. But the new structure becomes steadily more organized, and the magnetic
###1152 field takes on the character of a jet.
###1160 Within less than a second after the black hole is born, it launches a jet of particles
###1166 to a speed approaching light.
###1171 A similar chain of events, in the death of a large star, is responsible for longer gamma
###1181 ray bursts.
###1183 Stars resist gravity by generating photons that push outward on their enormous mass.
###1191 But the weight of a large star’s core increases from the accumulation of heavy elements produced
###1197 in nuclear fusion. In time, its outer layers cannot resist the inward pull… and the star
###1209 collapses.
###1214 The crash produces a shock wave that races through the star… and obliterates it.
###1229 In the largest of these dying stars, known as collapsars or hypernovae, a black hole
###1236 forms in the collapse.
###1241 Matter flowing in forms a disk. Charged particles create magnetic fields that twist off this
###1247 disk, sending a portion out in high-speed jets.
###1270 Simulations show that the jet is powerful enough to plow its way through the star. In
###1281 so doing, it may help trigger the explosion.
###1296 The birth of a black hole does not simply light up the universe.
###1305 It is a crucial event in the spread of heavy elements that seed the birth of new solar
###1310 systems and planets.
###1317 But the black hole birth cries that we can now register with a fleet of high-energy telescopes
###1326 are part of wider response to gravity’s convulsive power.
###1334 Take the gamma ray burst recorded by the Swift satellite in late March 2011.
###1342 It came from a normally quiescent galaxy in the Constellation Draco, 3.8 billion light
###1348 years away.
###1354 Most Gamma ray bursts fade within seconds or minutes. This one lasted four and a half
###1360 hours.
###1365 Scientists concluded that it could not have come from a supernova.
###1370 They proposed instead that a large star had probably been thrown off track during an encounter
###1376 with another star. It moved too close to a supermassive black hole in the center of the
###1383 galaxy.
###1387 This animation shows what happened. The black hole tore the star apart, and launched a jet
###1396 from matter that swirled in.
###1404 The jet happened to be pointed right at Earth.
###1412 We can be grateful this blast was so far away, and that we are not in the firing line of
###1418 a supermassive black hole that lies in the center of our own galaxy.
###1426 Astronomers have observed giant stars whipped to high speeds by this monster.
###1436 Should one of these stars be thrown off its path, it could become prey.
###1443 The monster will surely let distant observers know of its conquest, with a blinding flash
###1451 that’s visible across the universe.
