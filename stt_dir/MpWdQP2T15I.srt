1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:15,159



2
0:0:15,159 --> 0:0:17,24
HIME HERBERT: Ky's super
awesome, obviously, because he


3
0:0:17,24 --> 0:0:18,27
let us stay at his house.


4
0:0:18,27 --> 0:0:19,885
HARVEY FOSTER: You've blown
it with that answer!


5
0:0:19,885 --> 0:0:21,3
HIME HERBERT: What are
you talking about?


6
0:0:21,3 --> 0:0:22,2
HARVEY FOSTER: Ky's
sick because we


7
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:23,45
can stay at his place?


8
0:0:23,45 --> 0:0:27,62
HIME HERBERT: Well,
if you guys rolled


9
0:0:27,62 --> 0:0:28,27
into my parents' town--


10
0:0:28,27 --> 0:0:29,27
HARVEY FOSTER: That's
the worst answer


11
0:0:29,27 --> 0:0:30,19
I've ever heard, ever.


12
0:0:30,19 --> 0:0:31,205
HIME HERBERT: My parents
would never let you


13
0:0:31,205 --> 0:0:32,12
stay at their house.


14
0:0:32,12 --> 0:0:32,83
HARVEY FOSTER: That was bad.


15
0:0:32,83 --> 0:0:33,15
Cut.


16
0:0:33,15 --> 0:0:34,53
MALE SPEAKER: Ky's
sick because we


17
0:0:34,53 --> 0:0:35,43
can stay at his house?


18
0:0:35,43 --> 0:0:37,255
HIME HERBERT: Ky, you know
what I mean, right?


19
0:0:37,255 --> 0:0:38,69
KYNAN TAIT: What if I didn't
let you stay at the house?


20
0:0:38,69 --> 0:0:40,7
HIME HERBERT: I would still be
grateful for your company,


21
0:0:40,7 --> 0:0:42,6
because I think you're
an awesome guy.


22
0:0:42,6 --> 0:0:43,46
KYNAN TAIT: OK.


23
0:0:43,46 --> 0:0:45,15
MALE SPEAKER: Little
twist, eh, Patrick?


24
0:0:45,15 --> 0:0:46,77
HIME HERBERT: Ky, you
could stay at my


25
0:0:46,77 --> 0:0:47,98
house anytime you want--


26
0:0:47,98 --> 0:0:49,23
the whole kit.


27
0:0:49,23 --> 0:0:55,31



28
0:0:55,31 --> 0:0:58,52
KYNAN TAIT: My parents and my
little brother moved to Lareto


29
0:0:58,52 --> 0:1:0,96
a few years ago.


30
0:1:0,96 --> 0:1:5,519
I think for me it's the
perfect mix of Mexico.


31
0:1:5,519 --> 0:1:8,345
It's just touristy enough for me
where most of the people in


32
0:1:8,345 --> 0:1:11,68
the shops speak enough English
where you can get by not


33
0:1:11,68 --> 0:1:13,485
speaking any Spanish.


34
0:1:13,485 --> 0:1:19,53
And it's a well-kept city,
it's very quaint.


35
0:1:19,53 --> 0:1:22,841
I love the landscape down there
and I love the culture.


36
0:1:22,841 --> 0:1:29,4
I like how laid back it is and
their common disregard for


37
0:1:29,4 --> 0:1:35,51
time and the whole way that
Westerners live their life.


38
0:1:35,51 --> 0:1:37,98
So Lareto's kind of
the perfect mix,


39
0:1:37,98 --> 0:1:39,91
like Southern Baja--


40
0:1:39,91 --> 0:1:43,4
still Mexican, but still enough
tourist amenities to


41
0:1:43,4 --> 0:1:46,792
keep a Westerner happy.


42
0:1:46,792 --> 0:1:47,62
BRUCE WILLIAMS: Ready?


43
0:1:47,62 --> 0:1:48,618
KEEGAN SAUDER: Yep.


44
0:1:48,618 --> 0:1:50,614
BRUCE WILLIAMS: OK, this way.


45
0:1:50,614 --> 0:1:51,612
I'm Bruce.


46
0:1:51,612 --> 0:1:52,61
KEEGAN SAUDER: Bruce, Keegan.


47
0:1:52,61 --> 0:1:53,86
BRUCE WILLIAMS: How you doing?


48
0:1:53,86 --> 0:1:57,101



49
0:1:57,101 --> 0:1:59,68
MALE SPEAKER: What does
your brother do?


50
0:1:59,68 --> 0:2:3,29
KYNAN TAIT: He's now a scuba
dive instructor, so he's


51
0:2:3,29 --> 0:2:5,35
traveling a lot, too.


52
0:2:5,35 --> 0:2:8,389
He was living in Singapore,
now he's living in Mexico.


53
0:2:8,389 --> 0:2:12,381



54
0:2:12,381 --> 0:2:14,377
HEATH KIRCHART: Look
at that bird.


55
0:2:14,377 --> 0:2:17,371
Spread out.


56
0:2:17,371 --> 0:2:20,365
Hey Keegan, we need a hero
shot for the video.


57
0:2:20,365 --> 0:2:55,794



58
0:2:55,794 --> 0:3:1,38
BRUCE WILLIAMS: So they're about
600 pounds or so and


59
0:3:1,38 --> 0:3:4,85
they get a little bit noisy.


60
0:3:4,85 --> 0:3:8,515
We'll be pretty close to
them in the water.


61
0:3:8,515 --> 0:3:11,272
You shouldn't be afraid though,
they're curious.


62
0:3:11,272 --> 0:3:14,775
They're kind of used to people
being around them now.


63
0:3:14,775 --> 0:4:30,426



64
0:4:30,426 --> 0:4:32,5
KYNAN TAIT: One of those
spiny things?


65
0:4:32,5 --> 0:4:37,18



66
0:4:37,18 --> 0:4:38,51
You can touch them?


67
0:4:38,51 --> 0:4:40,76
Like, they're not--


68
0:4:40,76 --> 0:4:43,29
I have no interest in what's
going on under the water.


69
0:4:43,29 --> 0:4:47,4



70
0:4:47,4 --> 0:4:49,7
And just the feeling of
breathing underwater freaks


71
0:4:49,7 --> 0:4:50,95
the hell out of me.


72
0:4:50,95 --> 0:4:53,83



73
0:4:53,83 --> 0:4:57,74
And I don't care to look
at the fish down there.


74
0:4:57,74 --> 0:4:58,79
HEATH KIRCHART: Toys.


75
0:4:58,79 --> 0:5:1,663
KYNAN TAIT: And see these weird
alien-looking fish.


76
0:5:1,663 --> 0:5:4,2



77
0:5:4,2 --> 0:5:7,136
Nothing about that excites
me too much.


78
0:5:7,136 --> 0:5:8,75
HEATH KIRCHART: Ew, it's
got worms crawling


79
0:5:8,75 --> 0:5:10,0
out of it over here.


80
0:5:10,0 --> 0:5:16,356



81
0:5:16,356 --> 0:5:19,17
BRUCE WILLIAMS: That's called
a brittle star.


82
0:5:19,17 --> 0:5:21,574
KYNAN TAIT: Touch the middle
part of him, he's all soft.


83
0:5:21,574 --> 0:5:22,31
HEATH KIRCHART: Oh, is he?


84
0:5:22,31 --> 0:5:23,15
KEEGAN SAUDER: See?


85
0:5:23,15 --> 0:5:26,48
You can feel it sucking on your
hand, the middle part.


86
0:5:26,48 --> 0:5:30,41



87
0:5:30,41 --> 0:5:33,79
BRUCE WILLIAMS: Well, I can tell
already after seeing all


88
0:5:33,79 --> 0:5:37,16
of you in the water that none
of you are going to sink.


89
0:5:37,16 --> 0:5:40,58
Because you have a positive
attitude and a buoyant


90
0:5:40,58 --> 0:5:41,83
personality.


91
0:5:41,83 --> 0:5:44,415



92
0:5:44,415 --> 0:5:45,945
BRUCE WILLIAMS: That's
what you want.


93
0:5:45,945 --> 0:5:47,195
The ideal situation.


94
0:5:47,195 --> 0:5:55,11



95
0:5:55,11 --> 0:5:56,595
KEEGAN SAUDER: Now
we're coming.


96
0:5:56,595 --> 0:6:9,96



97
0:6:9,96 --> 0:6:11,445
That one hurt a bit.


98
0:6:11,445 --> 0:6:14,91



99
0:6:14,91 --> 0:6:16,16
HEATH KIRCHART: I want in!


100
0:6:16,16 --> 0:6:21,37



101
0:6:21,37 --> 0:6:22,62
I can't do it.


102
0:6:22,62 --> 0:6:27,544



103
0:6:27,544 --> 0:6:29,55
Good luck getting in.


104
0:6:29,55 --> 0:6:31,33
BRUCE WILLIAMS: Come on,
have another cigarette.


105
0:6:31,33 --> 0:6:31,86
HEATH KIRCHART: Kick!


106
0:6:31,86 --> 0:6:33,2
Kick!


107
0:6:33,2 --> 0:6:34,45
Kick!


108
0:6:34,45 --> 0:6:40,41



109
0:6:40,41 --> 0:6:42,73
BRUCE WILLIAMS: And your
impression at this time?


110
0:6:42,73 --> 0:7:1,312



111
0:7:1,312 --> 0:7:5,145
HIME HERBERT: I'm sweating
like a baked ham.


112
0:7:5,145 --> 0:7:8,6



113
0:7:8,6 --> 0:7:9,78
MALE SPEAKER: Was it you
that was asking for


114
0:7:9,78 --> 0:7:10,84
a temperature increase?


115
0:7:10,84 --> 0:7:12,475
HIME HERBERT: Yeah,
I was asking for


116
0:7:12,475 --> 0:7:13,38
a temperature increases.


117
0:7:13,38 --> 0:7:16,41
Now I would like a temperature
decrease.


118
0:7:16,41 --> 0:7:20,765
Just maybe five or
six degrees.


119
0:7:20,765 --> 0:7:23,1
BILL BRYANT: Blowing a fuse.


120
0:7:23,1 --> 0:7:25,16
ARTO SAARI: I have a brake
light, but I don't have


121
0:7:25,16 --> 0:7:27,16
running lights or a headlight.


122
0:7:27,16 --> 0:7:32,29
It would kind of suck driving at
night with no headlight and


123
0:7:32,29 --> 0:7:33,37
sunglasses on.


124
0:7:33,37 --> 0:7:36,38
And couldn't be bothered putting
the goggles on because


125
0:7:36,38 --> 0:7:37,71
they don't fit without
a helmet.


126
0:7:37,71 --> 0:7:40,84
So I have to just follow these
guys just to try to stay as


127
0:7:40,84 --> 0:7:46,16
close as possible to make sure
that I see where the road is.


128
0:7:46,16 --> 0:7:56,324



129
0:7:56,324 --> 0:8:0,196
BILL BRYANT: Here's that.


130
0:8:0,196 --> 0:8:1,83
HIME HERBERT: Oh God,
my hands are dirty!


131
0:8:1,83 --> 0:8:4,61



132
0:8:4,61 --> 0:8:8,91
[BURPS]


133
0:8:8,91 --> 0:8:15,796
Banana, V-8, coffee.


134
0:8:15,796 --> 0:8:17,46
That's delicious.


135
0:8:17,46 --> 0:10:17,46
