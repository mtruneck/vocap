###15 - Fascinating. - See, there you go.
###18 So what're you doing?
###20 - You're annoying me. - l'm OK with it.
###23 l've had such a crappy morning l decided to come out here and eat my lunch.
###27 This spot feels secluded. lt's so peaceful.
###31 l'm getting my spirit back.
###33 - lt's just a bench. - Sit down, sweet thang.
###46 Nice. You know, l've already eaten, but l could...

###71 <i>It's time to change this pattern,</i>
###75 - Morning. - How do you figure?
###77 Doing a little drilling?
###80 l have an idea. Let's go the whole day without getting in each other's hair.
###84 Just give each other a break? What do you say?
###88 l'm gonna give you a nickname.
###91 That's good. l already have a nickname. lt's JD.
###95 How about... Whinyface?
###100 Whinybritches?
###102 Whinysomething. l definitely like whiny.
###106 Whinydancer.
###125 l can't believe l went out last night.
###128 You said you were exhausted.
###130 l was. But l figured l owed it to the ladies.

###182 - Dr Cox. - And there you are.
###184 - Excuse me? - l was wondering if there's anything

###191 And there you are.
###193 - What's the story on the admit in 64? - She's great. l really like her.
###198 Let's see if you can't focus on things l give a rat's ass about.

###207 l don't care if it wasn't good first-date conversation,
###210 Michael deserved to know what l think about circumcising babies.
###215 What? Actually, no.
###217 No, it wasn't, which is surprising cos he's Jewish.
###220 - l gave her two Valium. - l'm e-mailing you as we're talking.
###224 How cool is that?
###226 So she's actually sedated as we speak?
###228 OK, bye.
###229 Elliot. OK, first impressions.
###232 - Did l scare Michael off? - No.
###234 Not if he enjoys a big fat cup of crazy.
###238 Ms Tracy, we're all busy, so if we could...
###241 l have the same e-maily-pagey thingy.
###243 Get out!
###248 - My H sticks a little bit. Does yours? - lt does!
###253 lt may just be a bench, but you know what?

###263 Serious?
###265 l love it that my man's all deep and whatnot.
###268 - You know, l get deep. - l know.
###270 - What's happening, Rerun? - What up, Roge?
###276 How about some of this?
###278 lt wasn't even that good a show.
###280 - Take it back. - This second.
###283 Look at the time. Gotta go, it's lunchtime.
###287 See ya, baby!
###288 - We still on for the Bresson exhibit? - Yes, we are.
###292 - Did you just ask out my girlfriend? - You wanna come?
###296 Black-and-white photography, no boobies.
###299 Hell, no.
###307 - Hello, sir. - Nice spot.
###310 Yes, sir.
###313 l usually try to get out here for lunch every day at 1 2.30.
###317 You don't say?
###319 Every day, 1 2.30, for 23 years.
###325 From now on, your name is Scooter.
###328 - l don't get it. - Short for scooter pie.
###331 l hate scooter pies.
###335 Now l see.

###348 <i>After working at a hospital for a while</i> <i>you develop a sixth sense for danger,</i>

###363 <i>Luckily I was prepared,</i>
###366 - You do your pre-rounds? - Yes.
###368 Discharge summaries? Pharmacy renewals?
###371 SOAP notes? Central line changes?
###373 Yes.
###374 OK, but did you go ahead and fix your beeper
###378 so it doesn't play that annoying song every time you get paged?
###384 Yes.
###386 <i>Crap,</i>

###406 Back during the gold rush when a man staked a claim,
###409 if he came upon another man panning his spot,
###411 he could shoot that fella dead
###414 without even asking any questions.
###417 You don't say.
###420 Simpler times.
###425 What if you've had three great dates and he likes you so much
###429 he hasn't even tried to have sex with you yet?
###432 l could sabotage that relationship in two phone calls.
###435 - l could do it in one. - Sabotage that relationship.
###438 l would ask him why he finds me so repulsive.
###441 Then, coerce him into having phone sex with me,
###444 then l would ask him if he thinks we have a future,
###447 and then l'd probably just cry until he hung up on me.
###450 - We are so alike. - l know!
###453 ''Oh, stop.'' ''No, you stop.''
###456 Oh, dear God.
###460 - Ms Tracy, we'll go ahead... - Can you give me one sec?
###463 l'm arranging to have food delivered. Fatty had a party and nobody came.
###468 Preaching to the choir.
###471 Think of what little patience l have
###474 as your virginity.
###478 You always thought it would be there until that night
###481 when you were feeling down,
###483 and your pal, Kevin, who just wanted to be friends,
###486 he dropped by and he brought a copy of 'About Last Night'
###490 and a four-pack of Bartles & Jaymes. And...
###494 lt was gone for ever. Just like my patience is now.
###498 So you do scary little speeches?
###502 - How adorable! - This is so much fun.
###505 Careful, Rapunzel. Fun time is officially over.
###509 You think you can just treat Bambi like that and walk away?
###513 Get him, girlfriend.
###515 What up, T-Dog?
###518 <i>The only way to avoid</i> <i>the high five with Todd</i>
###520 <i>is not to say anything</i> <i>that he can connect to sex,</i>
###523 How you doing?
###526 That's totally how my car was rocking when l took this girl out last night.
###534 Am l right?
###536 <i>He earned it,</i>
###540 Pain.
###541 - So Cox tore into you? - You know what pisses me off?
###545 No one ever calls him on anything.
###547 You want to kick and scream,
###549 that's fine, but if you ever yell at my friend again over nothing,
###553 then l will wipe that scary smile off your face,
###556 and keep it in my purse until no one around here
###559 is any more scared of you than l am.
###561 lt's not fair. Why are you eating in here?
###565 - T-man's afraid of Kelso. - l'm not afraid of Kelso.
###569 l just felt like eating in here.
###571 Go outside and stand up for yourself.
###575 Hell, yeah.
###579 You know what else stands up for itself?
###583 l'm not sure. But l'll guess that it's your penis.
###587 lt is.
###588 <i>Oh no,</i>
###590 Everyone, we can all relax now. The planets have been realigned
###594 and order shall be returned. Hey, you.
###597 Give me two seconds. Gotta finish e-mailing Jill.
###600 l have your little friend's test results.
###603 Shall we have some fun and take a look?
###605 lnteresting. EKG, negative. Tilt table, negative.
###609 Echo, negative.
###611 Nothing, in fact, is wrong with her but exhaustion, brought on by...
###616 let it come... being her.
###619 - Yeah, but if you don't... - No, no, no.
###623 There's no time for ''Yeah, buts''.
###625 l want her out of here in five minutes
###628 or you will be responsible for covering every missed shift
###631 during this year's flu season.
###634 Now go.
###636 Hey, you...
###638 For what it's worth, l don't care if your beeper plays
###643 <i>Who let the dogs out?</i> <i>Hoof hoof</i>

###656 - Excuse me? - Your mommy cr-rushed me.
###660 She did. l'd like to issue a warning to everybody,
###663 and l'm dead serious.
###665 FYl: JD's mommy has made it clear
###669 that she doesn't want her daughter picked on any more.
###672 Nothing mean. She's a precious flower and we should all be super nice to her.
###692 l was paged.
###695 Hello?
###696 Anyone?
###698 Oh, hell, no!
###704 When l get out, we should hang.
###706 l'd love to. l should warn you,
###708 l work a ton and when l'm off, l catch up on paperwork
###711 or read medical journals to stay ahead of the curve.
###714 l'm a nerd.
###716 l wish l could stay home and read, but my job, it's like, you know?
###719 With the married-by-the-millennium thing, l go on like, 1 ,000 blind dates.
###724 And all my friends always need something.
###727 There's me who never wants to let anyone down, you know, ever.
###733 With so many balls in the air, sometimes it gets a little overwhelming.
###739 As soon as l leave, l know l'm going right back to that mess.
###745 My God, l'm practically crying. How pathetic is that?
###751 <i>Around here</i> <i>you make big choices every day,</i>

###756 for the weekend, just to get some rest.
###760 <i>Most of these choices actually</i> <i>have nothing to do with medicine,</i>

###772 <i>Mommy,</i>
###777 - Give me that, Bambi, that's not a toy. - My name is not Bambi.
###781 lt's Dr Dorian. l don't need to be looked after.
###785 How about l'll be the doctor and you be the nurse.
###789 Yes, doctor.
###791 <i>Good choice,</i>
###801 l have to go check on something.
###803 <i>Fix this before word gets around,</i>
###806 Carla, wait.
###807 What did you do?
###809 - What did you do? - What did you do?
###813 She called me Bambi in front of everyone.
###816 - My name is not Bambi! - lt's Scooter!
###821 Short for scooter pie.
###824 Baby, JD is my best friend,
###826 but if you need me to kick his ass, l will kick his ass, cos l care for you.
###831 - And cos l'm willing to sleep with you. - Hell, yeah.
###835 lf l wanted his ass kicked l'd do it myself.
###840 Todd,
###842 if you ever make that noise at me again,
###845 l will reach into your mouth and unscrew that bulb
###848 that barely keeps your brain going.
###852 Dude, chick threats are hot.
###855 What did l say about annoying Carla?
###857 lf she makes me choose between you two, you know how it'll end up.
###861 Yes, l do. And l thank you for that.
###868 Could you be any cuter with the new hair colour?
###871 Holy cow! Please, no.
###875 Good morning, sunshine.
###879 Could you possibly excuse me for just one second?
###886 Dear God, you're still here.
###888 Who exactly is doing this to me?
###892 <i>There's nothing worse than</i> <i>knowing you've wronged a friend</i>
###895 <i>and having to apologise,</i>
###898 - Look, Carla... - lt's OK. You overreacted.
###901 l should've realised you can stand up for yourself.
###904 l know you would take it back if you could. l do.
###907 We're OK, right?
###909 - l think l've said all l can. - See you tonight for the exhibit.
###913 - Why'd you have me paged? - To ask you to forgive me.
###917 For what?
###918 Hello, sad clown.
###921 - Thanks for paging her. - How could you?
###924 He called me cutie and said my eyes were as blue as the ocean.
###928 l got confused.
###931 - lt probably would've worked on me too. - You're damn right it would've. Come.
###937 ls he single?
###939 Hello?
###941 Look at you, all proud.
###944 Don't tell me you've already managed to eat?
###946 l took my sweet time, too.
###951 Consider that your last supper. l'm bored with the games.
###955 - Are you forbidding me to sit here? - This is a public bench.
###959 You are as welcome here as l am but you won't come back again.
###963 You know why? Because you just don't have the mettle.
###968 Now get out of here so l can eat my wife's egg salad sandwich
###972 before the tomato soaks through the bread.
###979 Beautiful day.
###984 Did you get into photography when you were in college or...?
###988 No. Actually, l never went to college.
###993 Don't tell any of my patients but neither did l.
###998 ls that supposed to make me feel better?
###1001 No, it was just a joke.
###1003 l was doing the whole, like, turn a frown upside-down.
###1007 You know what? Hold it. l don't think we're OK.
###1011 You accepted my apology. You can't take it back.
###1014 Have you ever spent time with a woman?
###1023 ls my punishment still coming because the anticipation is killing me?
###1028 - Make your case. - l'm sorry, what?
###1031 Well, you tell me why Chorey McCrazy Chore
###1033 gets to stay here two more nights.
###1036 OK.
###1037 You don't know how hard it is for some women to make it alone.
###1041 Jill is so exhausted. She's her own worst enemy.
###1045 Constantly trying to please. She judges herself harsher than anyone.
###1049 Have you seen what you look like today?
###1051 l'm a skank. She never says no to anyone, so...
###1054 Could you pick up a sample of my dog's stool and take it to the vet for me?
###1060 l can do it at lunch.
###1064 lt's OK. Jill can stay a little longer.
###1067 And if we're real lucky, she'll realise that it's OK
###1071 to give yourself a break every once in a while, right?
###1086 l took a cab from the last stop.
###1088 - You forgot your coat. - l don't want it.
###1091 Why would you?
###1094 l was only gonna go to that exhibit
###1096 because l wanted you to think l was brainy.
###1099 - l'm so angry at myself. - Thank goodness.
###1103 l thought you were mad at me.
###1105 Hundreds of interns have decided they don't need me any more. Why should...?
###1109 This is why you can't be friends with doctors.
###1112 lf it's a problem, you, me, Elliot and Turk will get together...
###1116 l don't work with Turk and l'm not close to Elliot.
###1119 The only problem here is you, OK?
###1123 We're supposed to be friends.
###1126 Your self-esteem is so wrapped up in what you do.
###1130 A doctor. That's all you are. That's how you define yourself.
###1133 You think you're better than me because of it.
###1136 - Carla, l do not think... - Admit it.
###1138 Admit it right now or l'll never respect you again.
###1143 OK. Sometimes that's true.
###1148 - Carla, you're a good nurse. - l'm a great nurse.
###1152 You patronising ass.
###1157 You don't even get it, do you?
###1160 ln nine years, l never once felt bad about myself
###1163 for what l do, not for one second.
###1166 And then l met you.
###1170 - Please wait. - Don't.
###1206 <i>Sometimes the only way to</i> <i>take a good look at yourself</i>
