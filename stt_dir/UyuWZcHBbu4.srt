2
0:0:1,768 --> 0:0:3,33
COURTNEY: Hi everybody.


3
0:0:3,33 --> 0:0:4,67
Thanks for coming.


4
0:0:4,67 --> 0:0:7,25
Sorry that we're
starting a little late.


5
0:0:7,25 --> 0:0:8,84
I would like to take
this opportunity


6
0:0:8,84 --> 0:0:12,6
to introduce my neighbors,
Ian and Donna Mitroff.


7
0:0:12,6 --> 0:0:15,14
They are the authors of "Fables
and the Art of Leadership:


8
0:0:15,14 --> 0:0:18,1
Applying the Wisdom of Mr.
Rogers to the Workplace."


9
0:0:18,1 --> 0:0:18,891
Thank you.


10
0:0:18,891 --> 0:0:23,199
[APPLAUSE]


11
0:0:23,199 --> 0:0:25,49
DONNA MITROFF: Good afternoon
and thank you for coming.


12
0:0:25,49 --> 0:0:27,1
I'm Donna Mitroff.


13
0:0:27,1 --> 0:0:28,76
We're going to spend
some time telling you


14
0:0:28,76 --> 0:0:31,53
about how we came to know
Fred Rogers, how we came


15
0:0:31,53 --> 0:0:34,27
to work with him, how
this book came to be.


16
0:0:34,27 --> 0:0:40,5
But before we do, we have
a special surprise for you.


17
0:0:40,5 --> 0:0:42,8
So if you'll just
wait one moment.


18
0:0:42,8 --> 0:0:44,33
DAVID NEWELL: Speedy delivery.


19
0:0:44,33 --> 0:0:45,71
Hello everybody,
speedy delivery.


20
0:0:45,71 --> 0:0:48,7
My name is Mr. McFeely from
"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood."


21
0:0:48,7 --> 0:0:49,559
Hello.


22
0:0:49,559 --> 0:0:50,725
Do you all remember McFeely?


23
0:0:50,725 --> 0:0:51,912
[APPLAUSE]


24
0:0:51,912 --> 0:0:53,89
Well, that's me.


25
0:0:53,89 --> 0:0:56,68
I have a special
deliveries today.


26
0:0:56,68 --> 0:1:2,5
In this suitcase, there are
some sayings on these papers.


27
0:1:2,5 --> 0:1:4,69
And I thought I'd bring them by
and pass them all out to you.


28
0:1:4,69 --> 0:1:6,69
So we'll start here.


29
0:1:6,69 --> 0:1:8,16
You can take those.


30
0:1:8,16 --> 0:1:11,83
And by the way, I started on
"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood"


31
0:1:11,83 --> 0:1:16,55
in 1967, before most of you
were born I think, right?


32
0:1:16,55 --> 0:1:18,235
And it's been on
public television--


33
0:1:18,235 --> 0:1:20,24
do you have enough in this row?


34
0:1:20,24 --> 0:1:20,77
Here you go.


35
0:1:20,77 --> 0:1:22,4
Here's two more.


36
0:1:22,4 --> 0:1:27,69
And it showed on KQED,
and it's online now.


37
0:1:27,69 --> 0:1:30,53
So I'm sure you know
how to get online.


38
0:1:30,53 --> 0:1:35,24
And it's all over the
United States and in Canada.


39
0:1:35,24 --> 0:1:36,7
And we have a new
show now called


40
0:1:36,7 --> 0:1:39,98
"Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood,"
which is all animated.


41
0:1:39,98 --> 0:1:44,5
And it's carrying on
Fred Rogers' legacy


42
0:1:44,5 --> 0:1:46,11
along with the
Mitroffs, who are also


43
0:1:46,11 --> 0:1:49,17
carrying on Mr. Rogers'
legacy in a different way.


44
0:1:49,17 --> 0:1:50,35
But here I have more deliveries.


45
0:1:50,35 --> 0:1:52,14
Can you a pass those out?


46
0:1:52,14 --> 0:1:53,8
I have more.


47
0:1:53,8 --> 0:1:57,23
And also, a little later,
I brought with me--


48
0:1:57,23 --> 0:1:59,59
and the Mitroffs did a
special little addition.


49
0:1:59,59 --> 0:2:1,66
They put Google down here.


50
0:2:1,66 --> 0:2:3,8
And I can sign these.


51
0:2:3,8 --> 0:2:4,68
So we'll do that a
little later, too.


52
0:2:4,68 --> 0:2:6,36
And help yourself to
any of these cards.


53
0:2:6,36 --> 0:2:8,259
Let me get more deliveries here.


54
0:2:8,259 --> 0:2:10,69
I'll be right with
you, all right?


55
0:2:10,69 --> 0:2:13,22
Oh, if anybody has any questions
about the Neighborhood just


56
0:2:13,22 --> 0:2:14,6
ask me while we're doing this.


57
0:2:14,6 --> 0:2:16,92
Do you all remember seeing it?


58
0:2:16,92 --> 0:2:18,42
Have you all seen it?


59
0:2:18,42 --> 0:2:18,92
Yes?


60
0:2:18,92 --> 0:2:21,61
AUDIENCE: Did Mr. Rogers do
all the voices for the puppets?


61
0:2:21,61 --> 0:2:23,195
DAVID NEWELL: He did all
the voices for the puppets.


62
0:2:23,195 --> 0:2:24,81
DONNA MITROFF: Oh, we're
going to tell you all of that.


63
0:2:24,81 --> 0:2:27,185
DAVID NEWELL: Yes, you'll find
out more about that later.


64
0:2:27,185 --> 0:2:30,22
But yes he did, except
a lot of other people


65
0:2:30,22 --> 0:2:31,61
helped him maneuver them.


66
0:2:31,61 --> 0:2:33,69
So, he only had two hands.


67
0:2:33,69 --> 0:2:36,58
Thank you all for coming and put
the extras right back in here.


68
0:2:36,58 --> 0:2:38,871
DONNA MITROFF: Are you going
to tell them to open them?


69
0:2:38,871 --> 0:2:41,7
DAVID NEWELL: And I
also have, don't forget,


70
0:2:41,7 --> 0:2:43,959
after we're all done
here, and we have--


71
0:2:43,959 --> 0:2:46,25
DONNA MITROFF: Actually we're
going to do it right now,


72
0:2:46,25 --> 0:2:46,84
David.


73
0:2:46,84 --> 0:2:47,8
DAVID NEWELL: What?


74
0:2:47,8 --> 0:2:49,45
DONNA MITROFF: Open
up your messages.


75
0:2:49,45 --> 0:2:51,39
DAVID NEWELL: Oh, yes!


76
0:2:51,39 --> 0:2:53,63
Open up your messages
because Donna has,


77
0:2:53,63 --> 0:3:0,2
besides doing Google, if
anybody has on their message


78
0:3:0,2 --> 0:3:1,43
a little red dot.


79
0:3:1,43 --> 0:3:2,84
DONNA MITROFF: Red star.


80
0:3:2,84 --> 0:3:4,152
Raise your hand.


81
0:3:4,152 --> 0:3:6,67
DAVID NEWELL: Oh,
right off the bat.


82
0:3:6,67 --> 0:3:8,73
DONNA MITROFF: Come
on up because you


83
0:3:8,73 --> 0:3:13,336
are the lucky winners of
a free copy of this book.


84
0:3:13,336 --> 0:3:19,5
[APPLAUSE]


85
0:3:19,5 --> 0:3:22,35
We will be happy to
autograph these for you


86
0:3:22,35 --> 0:3:25,96
after the session is over--
the presentation is over.


87
0:3:25,96 --> 0:3:29,72
And any of you who decide
to buy the book, let us now.


88
0:3:29,72 --> 0:3:32,124
We'll manage to get
the autograph to you.


89
0:3:32,124 --> 0:3:33,54
We're pleased that
you came today.


90
0:3:33,54 --> 0:3:34,4
DAVID NEWELL: And
then afterwards, I


91
0:3:34,4 --> 0:3:36,3
can sign one of these,
or two of these,


92
0:3:36,3 --> 0:3:37,82
or however many what
I have enough time.


93
0:3:37,82 --> 0:3:40,94
So I can sign when
we're done here.


94
0:3:40,94 --> 0:3:43,52
But I think you're ready
to do your presentation.


95
0:3:43,52 --> 0:3:46,3
I will sit here and take
it all in, all righty?


96
0:3:46,3 --> 0:3:48,72
Speedy delivery.


97
0:3:48,72 --> 0:3:52,54
Oh yes, before we start, do
you think if I count to three,


98
0:3:52,54 --> 0:3:55,21
you all can say speedy
delivery and that'll


99
0:3:55,21 --> 0:3:56,45
be your cue to start.


100
0:3:56,45 --> 0:3:58,457
So here we go one, two, three.


101
0:3:58,457 --> 0:3:59,54
AUDIENCE: Speedy delivery.


102
0:3:59,54 --> 0:4:1,469
DAVID NEWELL: OK Donna.


103
0:4:1,469 --> 0:4:2,76
DONNA MITROFF: Thank you David.


104
0:4:2,76 --> 0:4:3,259
Thank you.


105
0:4:3,259 --> 0:4:5,38
David came all the
way from Pittsburgh


106
0:4:5,38 --> 0:4:7,44
to share this with us today.


107
0:4:7,44 --> 0:4:7,97
Pittsburgh--


108
0:4:7,97 --> 0:4:9,611
[APPLAUSE]


109
0:4:9,611 --> 0:4:11,11
DAVID NEWELL: Where
it's minus nine.


110
0:4:11,11 --> 0:4:14,69



111
0:4:14,69 --> 0:4:15,61
DONNA MITROFF:
Pittsburgh is the home


112
0:4:15,61 --> 0:4:17,12
of "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood."


113
0:4:17,12 --> 0:4:21,74
It's also the home of WQED,
the Pittsburgh PBS station.


114
0:4:21,74 --> 0:4:26,81
And that's where this
whole saga began for us.


115
0:4:26,81 --> 0:4:31,96
Back in the 1970s--
actually it was in the late


116
0:4:31,96 --> 0:4:36,7
'60s-- my husband and I moved
to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania


117
0:4:36,7 --> 0:4:39,65
where he took a job teaching at
the University of Pittsburgh.


118
0:4:39,65 --> 0:4:43,76
And I did other things,
went to graduate school,


119
0:4:43,76 --> 0:4:46,12
and did a Ph.D. in education.


120
0:4:46,12 --> 0:4:48,51
And then eventually
went to work for WQED.


121
0:4:48,51 --> 0:4:53,39
My first day on the job, I get
on the elevator and the person


122
0:4:53,39 --> 0:4:56,29
riding up from the ground
floor to the third floor


123
0:4:56,29 --> 0:4:58,64
with me is Mr. Rogers.


124
0:4:58,64 --> 0:5:1,8
And I was, as they
say, verklempt.


125
0:5:1,8 --> 0:5:6,67
So we started to talk and by
the end of riding three floors,


126
0:5:6,67 --> 0:5:9,79
he invited me to come
over to his office.


127
0:5:9,79 --> 0:5:11,33
And he said, maybe
there's something


128
0:5:11,33 --> 0:5:13,22
that we can do together.


129
0:5:13,22 --> 0:5:15,64
So I'm going to get into
telling you about that,


130
0:5:15,64 --> 0:5:18,255
but that's my background
and how I met Fred.


131
0:5:18,255 --> 0:5:19,88
I'm going to ask my
husband to tell you


132
0:5:19,88 --> 0:5:22,232
a little bit about
his background.


133
0:5:22,232 --> 0:5:24,67
IAN MITROFF: I have to
remember to talk through this.


134
0:5:24,67 --> 0:5:27,27
I was born and raised
in San Francisco.


135
0:5:27,27 --> 0:5:30,17
I did all my degrees
at UC Berkeley


136
0:5:30,17 --> 0:5:32,76
when it was really,
really cheap.


137
0:5:32,76 --> 0:5:36,27
So I went there from
freshman to Ph.D.


138
0:5:36,27 --> 0:5:38,82
I got my Ph.D. In
engineering from Berkeley.


139
0:5:38,82 --> 0:5:40,61
But while I was
getting my Ph.D.,


140
0:5:40,61 --> 0:5:42,32
I took a three and
a half year minor,


141
0:5:42,32 --> 0:5:45,28
which was unheard of, in
the philosophy of science,


142
0:5:45,28 --> 0:5:46,4
never been done.


143
0:5:46,4 --> 0:5:47,9
And the man who
taught me philosophy


144
0:5:47,9 --> 0:5:51,9
was in the business school
at Berkeley, a great man.


145
0:5:51,9 --> 0:5:52,92
And so he was a philosopher.


146
0:5:52,92 --> 0:5:55,28
So it was only natural
when I got through,


147
0:5:55,28 --> 0:5:57,69
because I loved
engineering, but I


148
0:5:57,69 --> 0:5:59,47
didn't want to do
engineering anymore.


149
0:5:59,47 --> 0:6:1,17
I went into a
business school where


150
0:6:1,17 --> 0:6:3,12
I've taught
organization behavior.


151
0:6:3,12 --> 0:6:5,91
All the people stuff that
they don't talk about


152
0:6:5,91 --> 0:6:7,4
in engineering school.


153
0:6:7,4 --> 0:6:11,4
So we were ripe
to do such a book.


154
0:6:11,4 --> 0:6:12,92
Anyway, Donna go on.


155
0:6:12,92 --> 0:6:16,61
DONNA MITROFF: So that's a us
back in the '70s, lots of hair,


156
0:6:16,61 --> 0:6:20,56
fewer wrinkles, fewer pounds.


157
0:6:20,56 --> 0:6:24,32
And take the next slide.


158
0:6:24,32 --> 0:6:28,23
I moved over to
WQED the late '70s.


159
0:6:28,23 --> 0:6:31,68
And that's me standing out
in front of X the Owl's tree.


160
0:6:31,68 --> 0:6:35,46
How many of you watched
Mr. Rogers at any time?


161
0:6:35,46 --> 0:6:36,656
Wow!


162
0:6:36,656 --> 0:6:39,87
That's pretty amazing.


163
0:6:39,87 --> 0:6:45,2
So anyway this show is one
of the longest running shows


164
0:6:45,2 --> 0:6:50,41
on public television
ever, 35 continuous years.


165
0:6:50,41 --> 0:6:52,16
And it is still available.


166
0:6:52,16 --> 0:6:54,82
As David said, you can
still see it online.


167
0:6:54,82 --> 0:6:58,42
Lots of parents find it and
watch it with their kids


168
0:6:58,42 --> 0:7:1,91
today because it's still
speaks to you today.


169
0:7:1,91 --> 0:7:5,2
So after my meeting with
Fred Rogers in the elevator,


170
0:7:5,2 --> 0:7:6,85
I went by his office.


171
0:7:6,85 --> 0:7:9,19
And we started talking
about what we could do.


172
0:7:9,19 --> 0:7:11,31
I was an educator,
there as director


173
0:7:11,31 --> 0:7:13,1
of educational services.


174
0:7:13,1 --> 0:7:16,62
And he said, I wish
we could do more


175
0:7:16,62 --> 0:7:20,87
to help people-- parents,
caregivers, preschool teachers,


176
0:7:20,87 --> 0:7:23,94
whoever's using it-- help
them understand that there are


177
0:7:23,94 --> 0:7:27,61
some lessons, not just watch
the show, but something to do.


178
0:7:27,61 --> 0:7:32,31
So we set about developing what
we call the plan and play book.


179
0:7:32,31 --> 0:7:36,48
I was watching the shows
then writing lesson plans


180
0:7:36,48 --> 0:7:39,49
for what to do after
you watch the show.


181
0:7:39,49 --> 0:7:44,53
And that book became sort of the
basis for Public Television's


182
0:7:44,53 --> 0:7:48,24
Ready to Learn Project,
and started a relationship


183
0:7:48,24 --> 0:7:51,3
with Fred and his
company, including


184
0:7:51,3 --> 0:7:58,79
David, that has gone on since
the late '60s, '70s, and exists


185
0:7:58,79 --> 0:8:4,54
even today where I'm still
involved with the Fred Rogers


186
0:8:4,54 --> 0:8:7,56
company, and with the
Fred Rogers memorial


187
0:8:7,56 --> 0:8:10,79
scholarship, which is
our effort to continue


188
0:8:10,79 --> 0:8:13,14
with his legacy in
children's media.


189
0:8:13,14 --> 0:8:16,83



190
0:8:16,83 --> 0:8:20,6
Who was Fred Rogers?


191
0:8:20,6 --> 0:8:22,83
How many of you think you
know how Fred Rogers was?


192
0:8:22,83 --> 0:8:25,39
What a unique person he was.


193
0:8:25,39 --> 0:8:28,91
Do you know that
he was a puppeteer?


194
0:8:28,91 --> 0:8:30,27
He did most of the puppets.


195
0:8:30,27 --> 0:8:34,63
Do you know that
he wrote the music?


196
0:8:34,63 --> 0:8:36,71
He played the music.


197
0:8:36,71 --> 0:8:41,8
Do know that he wrote
most of the scripts?


198
0:8:41,8 --> 0:8:46,82
Do you know that he had advanced
degrees in child development?


199
0:8:46,82 --> 0:8:50,48
So it didn't just come
from his imagination.


200
0:8:50,48 --> 0:8:53,96
It came from his heart, and
his soul, and his training.


201
0:8:53,96 --> 0:8:57,81
So there's so much
embedded in the stories


202
0:8:57,81 --> 0:9:2,6
that he told, way beyond.


203
0:9:2,6 --> 0:9:4,455
He was not a typical performer.


204
0:9:4,455 --> 0:9:5,83
He wasn't an actor.


205
0:9:5,83 --> 0:9:7,85
In fact, David
will share with you


206
0:9:7,85 --> 0:9:10,42
some of the stories
about how reluctant he


207
0:9:10,42 --> 0:9:14,85
was to do things other than
keep building a great show.


208
0:9:14,85 --> 0:9:19,5
So the show went
on the air in '67?


209
0:9:19,5 --> 0:9:24,49
DAVID NEWELL: It went on
air February 18, 1968.


210
0:9:24,49 --> 0:9:27,27
We started taping in '67.


211
0:9:27,27 --> 0:9:30,81
DONNA MITROFF: So on the
air five times a week,


212
0:9:30,81 --> 0:9:35,9
every week, for an
entire 35 years.


213
0:9:35,9 --> 0:9:41,53
So there's a lot of Mr.
Rogers embedded in your minds.


214
0:9:41,53 --> 0:9:42,65
And its back there.


215
0:9:42,65 --> 0:9:44,66
And what we're
going to do is help


216
0:9:44,66 --> 0:9:49,36
you bring those lessons
back forward to today.


217
0:9:49,36 --> 0:9:50,66
IAN MITROFF: Let me
just add one thing.


218
0:9:50,66 --> 0:9:54,6
Probably most people don't
know that Fred was an ordained


219
0:9:54,6 --> 0:9:55,86
Presbyterian minister.


220
0:9:55,86 --> 0:9:58,89
And he looked at the state
of children's television


221
0:9:58,89 --> 0:10:1,35
as it was at the time--
mostly like throwing pies


222
0:10:1,35 --> 0:10:5,49
in people's faces-- and
his ministry literally


223
0:10:5,49 --> 0:10:9,1
became to make
television for children


224
0:10:9,1 --> 0:10:11,64
what it should and must become.


225
0:10:11,64 --> 0:10:14,35
And that really was
this lifelong goal.


226
0:10:14,35 --> 0:10:16,98



227
0:10:16,98 --> 0:10:20,69
DONNA MITROFF: Now,
his major show was "Mr.


228
0:10:20,69 --> 0:10:24,13
Rogers' Neighborhood." and
"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood"


229
0:10:24,13 --> 0:10:26,76
was made up of these
two different segments.


230
0:10:26,76 --> 0:10:29,32
You remember how he would
come in, put on his sweater,


231
0:10:29,32 --> 0:10:30,89
change his shoes.


232
0:10:30,89 --> 0:10:32,83
He did that because
kids like routine.


233
0:10:32,83 --> 0:10:36,25
It gets to be very
comfortable for you.


234
0:10:36,25 --> 0:10:41,31
But then he would go into
his own home, on the set,


235
0:10:41,31 --> 0:10:43,7
and there would be
many experiences where


236
0:10:43,7 --> 0:10:46,31
he would bring people
in and they would talk.


237
0:10:46,31 --> 0:10:48,94
He would take you
out to visit places


238
0:10:48,94 --> 0:10:52,12
that people love, like the
visit to the Crayon Factory.


239
0:10:52,12 --> 0:10:52,97
Kids play with crayons.


240
0:10:52,97 --> 0:10:55,67
They want to know how
do crayons get made?


241
0:10:55,67 --> 0:10:58,61
So he would take
people to real places


242
0:10:58,61 --> 0:11:3,7
and do documentary
footage in a real setting.


243
0:11:3,7 --> 0:11:5,97
And one of the
highlights of his show


244
0:11:5,97 --> 0:11:9,4
was always the Neighborhood
of Make Believe.


245
0:11:9,4 --> 0:11:11,78
He'd send that little
trolley around the track.


246
0:11:11,78 --> 0:11:13,68
And this was done
very deliberately.


247
0:11:13,68 --> 0:11:15,83
So you're leaving
the real world,


248
0:11:15,83 --> 0:11:17,71
and you're going
into a neighborhood


249
0:11:17,71 --> 0:11:20,23
of make believe where
anything can happen.


250
0:11:20,23 --> 0:11:22,23
And the Neighborhood
of Make Believe


251
0:11:22,23 --> 0:11:27,45
was populated by puppets
that everyone came to know.


252
0:11:27,45 --> 0:11:31,2
Here's just a few of them King
Friday, Queen Sarah Saturday,


253
0:11:31,2 --> 0:11:34,62
Lady Elaine Fairchilde, Lady
Aberlin, and Daniel Tiger.


254
0:11:34,62 --> 0:11:39,7
Daniel tiger, the one who is
now the star of the new show.


255
0:11:39,7 --> 0:11:42,36
Many others in the
Neighborhood of Make Believe,


256
0:11:42,36 --> 0:11:45,6
and some live
performers, never Fred.


257
0:11:45,6 --> 0:11:47,93
You never saw him in the
Neighborhood of Make Believe


258
0:11:47,93 --> 0:11:49,33
because he was real.


259
0:11:49,33 --> 0:11:53,4
But you saw some of the other
people as live performers.


260
0:11:53,4 --> 0:11:54,35
David was there.


261
0:11:54,35 --> 0:11:58,16
You would see David in the
Neighborhood of Make Believe.


262
0:11:58,16 --> 0:12:2,28
And in that Neighborhood
of Make Believe


263
0:12:2,28 --> 0:12:9,4
is where we found this richness
of information and ideas


264
0:12:9,4 --> 0:12:10,84
that we want to share with you.


265
0:12:10,84 --> 0:12:13,72



266
0:12:13,72 --> 0:12:18,69
So what began to happen
as-- after Fred died,


267
0:12:18,69 --> 0:12:21,64
I was involved with the
Academy of Television Arts


268
0:12:21,64 --> 0:12:24,166
and Sciences, the ones
who do the Emmy's.


269
0:12:24,166 --> 0:12:28,64
And we decided there
that we give a tribute


270
0:12:28,64 --> 0:12:32,73
to Mr. Rogers for the industry
in Southern California.


271
0:12:32,73 --> 0:12:35,43
So we set about-- I was
one of the producers


272
0:12:35,43 --> 0:12:38,27
of that show--
putting this together.


273
0:12:38,27 --> 0:12:41,54
And in doing so, I was
re-reading Fred's materials,


274
0:12:41,54 --> 0:12:44,35
looking at the shows, and I
kept coming home and telling


275
0:12:44,35 --> 0:12:47,35
my husband, who was a professor
of management organizational


276
0:12:47,35 --> 0:12:53,43
behavior, much of what goes into
making organizations work until


277
0:12:53,43 --> 0:12:56,0
he said--


278
0:12:56,0 --> 0:12:58,78
IAN MITROFF: When Donn a
was sharing the lessons,


279
0:12:58,78 --> 0:13:0,58
the lessons were more
profound than you


280
0:13:0,58 --> 0:13:1,92
get in most management books.


281
0:13:1,92 --> 0:13:4,96
I mean, they're not devoid
of lessons, but they're dry.


282
0:13:4,96 --> 0:13:6,43
They're didactic.


283
0:13:6,43 --> 0:13:9,46
And the idea that
took shape for Donna


284
0:13:9,46 --> 0:13:11,88
and I is that we began
to go back and read


285
0:13:11,88 --> 0:13:14,31
some of the major
fables the were


286
0:13:14,31 --> 0:13:16,6
on the Neighborhood
of Make Believe.


287
0:13:16,6 --> 0:13:18,3
And the idea that
crystallized is


288
0:13:18,3 --> 0:13:21,74
that the fables were in effect
little mini business cases.


289
0:13:21,74 --> 0:13:24,63
That King Friday, for
example, is the autocratic CEO


290
0:13:24,63 --> 0:13:27,4
and you can begin to identify
the other characters.


291
0:13:27,4 --> 0:13:30,8
And the idea said, Look
let's try and teach


292
0:13:30,8 --> 0:13:33,71
organizational behavior
through fables and stories.


293
0:13:33,71 --> 0:13:34,97
Why fables and stories?


294
0:13:34,97 --> 0:13:38,4
Because that's the primary
way that human beings


295
0:13:38,4 --> 0:13:39,56
have communicated
with one another


296
0:13:39,56 --> 0:13:42,75
since the dawn of civilization,
not with formulas,


297
0:13:42,75 --> 0:13:45,6
not with textbooks,
but with good stories.


298
0:13:45,6 --> 0:13:49,0
We were lucky to get to Palgrave
McMillan-- the next slide.


299
0:13:49,0 --> 0:13:50,22
DONNA MITROFF: But wait I
want to have the next slide.


300
0:13:50,22 --> 0:13:51,678
IAN MITROFF: We
were lucky to get--


301
0:13:51,678 --> 0:13:53,64
DONNA MITROFF: A
contributer to this idea


302
0:13:53,64 --> 0:13:56,87
that there are lessons
here for grownups


303
0:13:56,87 --> 0:13:59,26
was at this tribute
to Fred Rogers.


304
0:13:59,26 --> 0:14:2,69
One of the people who
spoke was Anne Sweeney.


305
0:14:2,69 --> 0:14:5,43
Some of you might have heard--
Anne was here recently doing


306
0:14:5,43 --> 0:14:11,34
a talk to women's leadership
in Silicon Valley.


307
0:14:11,34 --> 0:14:14,21
And you see she's got a
very high level position.


308
0:14:14,21 --> 0:14:17,38
And when Anne came
on to the stage


309
0:14:17,38 --> 0:14:20,61
and talked about what she
learned from Fred Rogers


310
0:14:20,61 --> 0:14:24,99
that she still uses as
a high level executive,


311
0:14:24,99 --> 0:14:27,8
it helped to crystallize
our feeling that there


312
0:14:27,8 --> 0:14:31,22
are other people out there who
learned things from Fred that


313
0:14:31,22 --> 0:14:35,54
stayed with them, not just
as my husband always says,


314
0:14:35,54 --> 0:14:40,8
he helped you as a child, he
can help you as a grown up.


315
0:14:40,8 --> 0:14:45,67
So we went on and
we found a publisher


316
0:14:45,67 --> 0:14:50,62
and we pulled together
these three principles.


317
0:14:50,62 --> 0:14:52,262
Fred's lessons
were more profound


318
0:14:52,262 --> 0:14:54,47
than traditional methods of
management and leadership


319
0:14:54,47 --> 0:14:55,29
training.


320
0:14:55,29 --> 0:14:57,64
He taught through
stories and fables.


321
0:14:57,64 --> 0:14:59,66
Those who watched
as children are now


322
0:14:59,66 --> 0:15:2,12
in middle and upper
management positions.


323
0:15:2,12 --> 0:15:3,872
And here you are.


324
0:15:3,872 --> 0:15:5,33
You watched him
when you were a kid


325
0:15:5,33 --> 0:15:8,818
and now you're advancing
through your careers.


326
0:15:8,818 --> 0:15:12,28
IAN MITROFF: Can we go
through to the next slide?


327
0:15:12,28 --> 0:15:15,97
Let me tell you what
crystallized is we went back


328
0:15:15,97 --> 0:15:18,75
and read the fables.


329
0:15:18,75 --> 0:15:21,382
Seven principles
emerged early on.


330
0:15:21,382 --> 0:15:22,84
And those are the
seven principles.


331
0:15:22,84 --> 0:15:24,16
Go to the next slide.


332
0:15:24,16 --> 0:15:27,41
And each of them is illustrated
through a direct quote


333
0:15:27,41 --> 0:15:30,309
from Fred and an accompanying
fable in the book.


334
0:15:30,309 --> 0:15:32,6
And we're going to read just
through the fables because


335
0:15:32,6 --> 0:15:33,78
of time later.


336
0:15:33,78 --> 0:15:34,97
So the first one, connect.


337
0:15:34,97 --> 0:15:36,51
You can read it.
"A person can grow


338
0:15:36,51 --> 0:15:39,9
to his or her
fullest capacity only


339
0:15:39,9 --> 0:15:42,0
in mutually caring
relationships with others."


340
0:15:42,0 --> 0:15:44,49
Next please.


341
0:15:44,49 --> 0:15:45,7
Concern.


342
0:15:45,7 --> 0:15:48,94
One of the misperceptions
of Fred Rogers


343
0:15:48,94 --> 0:15:53,82
is that he was thoroughly
no rules, anything goes.


344
0:15:53,82 --> 0:15:55,66
That's not true at all.


345
0:15:55,66 --> 0:15:59,13
I think one of the best sayings
that we culled out from Fred


346
0:15:59,13 --> 0:16:2,99
is, "Setting rules," good
rules, not harsh rules,


347
0:16:2,99 --> 0:16:5,48
"is one of the primary
ways in which we


348
0:16:5,48 --> 0:16:7,47
show our love for others."


349
0:16:7,47 --> 0:16:11,22
Now, in a good organization
you do it with your employees,


350
0:16:11,22 --> 0:16:14,0
not didactically, not
necessarily autocratically.


351
0:16:14,0 --> 0:16:16,2
Next one please.


352
0:16:16,2 --> 0:16:19,29
"Play is the expression
of creativity,


353
0:16:19,29 --> 0:16:23,16
and I," Fred believes, "is at
the very root of our ability


354
0:16:23,16 --> 0:16:26,34
to learn to cope and
become whatever we may be."


355
0:16:26,34 --> 0:16:28,47
Next please.


356
0:16:28,47 --> 0:16:29,54
Communication.


357
0:16:29,54 --> 0:16:32,21
"In times of stress,"
especially in stress,


358
0:16:32,21 --> 0:16:34,1
"the best thing we
can do for each other


359
0:16:34,1 --> 0:16:35,66
is listen with our
ears and our hearts


360
0:16:35,66 --> 0:16:37,368
to be assured that
our questions are just


361
0:16:37,368 --> 0:16:38,88
as important as our answers."


362
0:16:38,88 --> 0:16:41,47
I don't need to tell you that
it's obviously broken down


363
0:16:41,47 --> 0:16:42,73
on our political life.


364
0:16:42,73 --> 0:16:45,76
One thing I ought to
say, we have no illusions


365
0:16:45,76 --> 0:16:48,1
about what
organizations are today.


366
0:16:48,1 --> 0:16:51,14
We're talking about an
ideal, which if we practice,


367
0:16:51,14 --> 0:16:54,5
it would hopefully improve
our organizations as they are.


368
0:16:54,5 --> 0:16:56,58
Next one please.


369
0:16:56,58 --> 0:16:57,73
Consciousness.


370
0:16:57,73 --> 0:17:0,86
"Take good care of that part of
you where your best dreams come


371
0:17:0,86 --> 0:17:4,957
from, that invisible part
of you," Fred was spiritual,


372
0:17:4,957 --> 0:17:7,29
"that allows you to look upon
yourself and your neighbor


373
0:17:7,29 --> 0:17:9,65
with delight."


374
0:17:9,65 --> 0:17:10,22
Next one.


375
0:17:10,22 --> 0:17:14,63
Maybe go back to
the previous one.


376
0:17:14,63 --> 0:17:17,244
There is some growing
recognition, believe it or not,


377
0:17:17,244 --> 0:17:19,68
in business schools and
schools of management,


378
0:17:19,68 --> 0:17:23,9
that spirituality at work
plays a core role in our lives.


379
0:17:23,9 --> 0:17:25,97
I was fortunate to write
one of the earliest


380
0:17:25,97 --> 0:17:29,44
books on spirituality at
work, and I went around


381
0:17:29,44 --> 0:17:32,17
and interviewed people
and what spirituality


382
0:17:32,17 --> 0:17:33,81
meant to them during their day.


383
0:17:33,81 --> 0:17:35,28
For example, how
much of themselves


384
0:17:35,28 --> 0:17:36,321
they could bring to work?


385
0:17:36,321 --> 0:17:38,62
Next one, please.


386
0:17:38,62 --> 0:17:39,66
Courage.


387
0:17:39,66 --> 0:17:42,62
"One of the greatest paradoxes,"
about life, "about omnipotence


388
0:17:42,62 --> 0:17:45,35
is that we need feel
it early in life,


389
0:17:45,35 --> 0:17:47,88
and lose it early
in life, in order


390
0:17:47,88 --> 0:17:52,25
to achieve a healthy, realistic,
yet exciting sense of potency


391
0:17:52,25 --> 0:17:52,96
later on."


392
0:17:52,96 --> 0:17:54,56
Next one, please.


393
0:17:54,56 --> 0:17:55,88
Community.


394
0:17:55,88 --> 0:17:58,16
"All of us, at some
time or other,"


395
0:17:58,16 --> 0:18:0,25
I might say even
constantly, "need help.


396
0:18:0,25 --> 0:18:3,6
Whether we're giving or
receiving help, each one of us


397
0:18:3,6 --> 0:18:5,172
has something valuable
to bring to the world.


398
0:18:5,172 --> 0:18:6,88
That's one of the
things that connects us


399
0:18:6,88 --> 0:18:9,35
as neighbors-- in
our own way, each one


400
0:18:9,35 --> 0:18:10,6
is a giver and a receiver."


401
0:18:10,6 --> 0:18:12,37
I mean if we could
summarize the book,


402
0:18:12,37 --> 0:18:14,78
how could we turn
our organizations


403
0:18:14,78 --> 0:18:17,18
at best into caring
neighborhoods.


404
0:18:17,18 --> 0:18:19,4
Next one, please.


405
0:18:19,4 --> 0:18:22,98
OK, here the seven
fables that we picked out


406
0:18:22,98 --> 0:18:26,2
to illustrate each
of these principles.


407
0:18:26,2 --> 0:18:29,26
And the fables just ring.


408
0:18:29,26 --> 0:18:31,59
In fact, they're really
in your consciences.


409
0:18:31,59 --> 0:18:34,1
Now, we're just going
to talk about two


410
0:18:34,1 --> 0:18:35,37
of them because of time.


411
0:18:35,37 --> 0:18:39,69
So Donna you ah-- We're going
to start with "Planet Purple"


412
0:18:39,69 --> 0:18:41,99
and we'll talk about "The
Bass Violin Festival."


413
0:18:41,99 --> 0:18:43,615
DONNA MITROFF: So
I'm going to give you


414
0:18:43,615 --> 0:18:46,35
a brief reading
of the story just


415
0:18:46,35 --> 0:18:49,28
to take you back
to remember what


416
0:18:49,28 --> 0:18:52,95
happened in the story
of "Planet Purple."


417
0:18:52,95 --> 0:18:57,62
And then you just think about
this as a mini case study,


418
0:18:57,62 --> 0:18:59,88
but Ian's going to
break it down or you


419
0:18:59,88 --> 0:19:3,23
tell how it teaches
lessons for management


420
0:19:3,23 --> 0:19:4,73
and for organizations.


421
0:19:4,73 --> 0:19:6,65
The story of "Planet Purple."


422
0:19:6,65 --> 0:19:9,57
"On a space mission,
Lady Elaine Fairchilde


423
0:19:9,57 --> 0:19:11,39
discovered a new planet.


424
0:19:11,39 --> 0:19:14,35
A place where
everything was purple.


425
0:19:14,35 --> 0:19:16,62
Everyone had the
same purple home.


426
0:19:16,62 --> 0:19:18,16
The sky was purple.


427
0:19:18,16 --> 0:19:20,72
The cars, chairs, and
streets were purple.


428
0:19:20,72 --> 0:19:23,71
And there were the
same purple trees.


429
0:19:23,71 --> 0:19:25,8
In addition, all of
the boys and girls


430
0:19:25,8 --> 0:19:28,21
were named Paul and Pauline.


431
0:19:28,21 --> 0:19:32,41
And every single panda
was call Purple Panda.


432
0:19:32,41 --> 0:19:36,71
Everyone on Planet Purple ate
purple pumpernickel pudding,


433
0:19:36,71 --> 0:19:39,98
and talked in the
same monotonous voice.


434
0:19:39,98 --> 0:19:42,27
And for years and
years, everybody


435
0:19:42,27 --> 0:19:45,8
dreamed the same dreams
and had the same hopes.


436
0:19:45,8 --> 0:19:48,58
"When Lady Elaine Fairchilde's
bright green space


437
0:19:48,58 --> 0:19:51,39
ship landed on Planet
Purple and she stepped out


438
0:19:51,39 --> 0:19:55,8
in her white astronaut suit,
the Planet Purple people


439
0:19:55,8 --> 0:19:56,815
ran and hid in fear.


440
0:19:56,815 --> 0:20:0,93
But one Paul, and one
Pauline, and one purple panda


441
0:20:0,93 --> 0:20:2,39
didn't run and hide.


442
0:20:2,39 --> 0:20:5,55
They stayed around to look
at this curious creature.


443
0:20:5,55 --> 0:20:8,0
Lady Elaine, whose favorite
color happened to be purple,


444
0:20:8,0 --> 0:20:10,58
was very intrigued
by this planet.


445
0:20:10,58 --> 0:20:12,55
She liked seeing
everything in purple


446
0:20:12,55 --> 0:20:14,11
and she liked not
having to remember


447
0:20:14,11 --> 0:20:15,96
a lot of different names.


448
0:20:15,96 --> 0:20:18,25
"After exploring the
planet, she decided


449
0:20:18,25 --> 0:20:21,17
to fly back to tell
everyone back home


450
0:20:21,17 --> 0:20:23,16
about this new planet.


451
0:20:23,16 --> 0:20:27,37
Lady Elaine didn't know that
Paul, Pauline, and Purple Panda


452
0:20:27,37 --> 0:20:31,35
were watching her and
decided to follow her.


453
0:20:31,35 --> 0:20:33,84
"The Planet Purple
way to travel is just


454
0:20:33,84 --> 0:20:36,31
by thinking and thinking alone.


455
0:20:36,31 --> 0:20:38,78
All you have to do is
think that you're someplace


456
0:20:38,78 --> 0:20:40,74
and instantly you'll be there.


457
0:20:40,74 --> 0:20:43,26
So Paul, Pauline,
and Purple Panda


458
0:20:43,26 --> 0:20:46,51
thought about Lady Elaine, where
she was and immediately they


459
0:20:46,51 --> 0:20:49,42
arrived in the Neighborhood
of Make Believe.


460
0:20:49,42 --> 0:20:52,29
"They could hardly believe
what they saw and heard.


461
0:20:52,29 --> 0:20:55,27
Everything and
everybody was different.


462
0:20:55,27 --> 0:20:58,0
Purple Panda was so
excited that he sat down


463
0:20:58,0 --> 0:21:0,12
in the first rocking
chair he saw.


464
0:21:0,12 --> 0:21:1,71
He rocked, and he
rocked, and rocked,


465
0:21:1,71 --> 0:21:4,88
and then he remembered one
of Planet Purple's laws.


466
0:21:4,88 --> 0:21:7,66
Anyone who rocks
on a rocking chair


467
0:21:7,66 --> 0:21:10,21
may not live in Planet Purple.


468
0:21:10,21 --> 0:21:11,59
But now it was too late.


469
0:21:11,59 --> 0:21:13,19
He could never go back.


470
0:21:13,19 --> 0:21:15,94
Paul and Pauline wanted
to explore this new place


471
0:21:15,94 --> 0:21:16,88
before going back.


472
0:21:16,88 --> 0:21:18,41
So they went everywhere.


473
0:21:18,41 --> 0:21:18,91
They looked.


474
0:21:18,91 --> 0:21:19,43
They listened.


475
0:21:19,43 --> 0:21:20,0
They smelled.


476
0:21:20,0 --> 0:21:20,62
They touched.


477
0:21:20,62 --> 0:21:23,17
They felt the colors,
They smelled the smells.


478
0:21:23,17 --> 0:21:25,69
And they felt the
different feelings.


479
0:21:25,69 --> 0:21:28,82
"One day Paul fell
down and hurt himself.


480
0:21:28,82 --> 0:21:31,53
And he felt something wet
trickling down his cheek.


481
0:21:31,53 --> 0:21:34,25



482
0:21:34,25 --> 0:21:37,3
A rabbit asked him
why he was crying?


483
0:21:37,3 --> 0:21:39,83
Paul had to ask
what crying meant.


484
0:21:39,83 --> 0:21:42,34
No one ever cried
on Planet Purple.


485
0:21:42,34 --> 0:21:46,41
When the rabbit heard that Paul
had never cried before he said,


486
0:21:46,41 --> 0:21:48,59
you've just started to live.


487
0:21:48,59 --> 0:21:50,56
"Finally, Paul and
Pauline decided


488
0:21:50,56 --> 0:21:52,31
to return to Planet Purple.


489
0:21:52,31 --> 0:21:54,21
So they use the
Planet Purple way


490
0:21:54,21 --> 0:21:57,62
to travel, thought about being
there and they were back home.


491
0:21:57,62 --> 0:22:0,64
They told the other Pauls
and Paulines about the place


492
0:22:0,64 --> 0:22:2,2
where Lady Elaine lived.


493
0:22:2,2 --> 0:22:4,22
How everything is so
different and nobody


494
0:22:4,22 --> 0:22:6,67
is exactly the same
as anyone else.


495
0:22:6,67 --> 0:22:9,47
They even told about
Purple Panda rocking


496
0:22:9,47 --> 0:22:11,59
in the rocking
chair, and everyone


497
0:22:11,59 --> 0:22:15,22
knew he'd broken the law
and could never come back.


498
0:22:15,22 --> 0:22:18,32
"The other Pauls and
Paulines didn't like the idea


499
0:22:18,32 --> 0:22:21,24
that everything and everybody
should be different.


500
0:22:21,24 --> 0:22:25,58
Paul and Pauline helped them
imagine colors, sound, smells,


501
0:22:25,58 --> 0:22:26,48
feelings.


502
0:22:26,48 --> 0:22:29,38
It took a long time to
change their planet.


503
0:22:29,38 --> 0:22:31,84
And some people didn't
like some things,


504
0:22:31,84 --> 0:22:34,27
and other people didn't
like other things,


505
0:22:34,27 --> 0:22:35,91
but everybody ended
up saying it was


506
0:22:35,91 --> 0:22:39,2
still better than being
the same all the time.


507
0:22:39,2 --> 0:22:42,5
They even changed the
law about rocking chairs


508
0:22:42,5 --> 0:22:45,47
so Purple Panda could come
back any time he wanted.


509
0:22:45,47 --> 0:22:48,7
"The citizens of Planet
Purple held a celebration


510
0:22:48,7 --> 0:22:50,2
to announce that the
name of Planet Purple


511
0:22:50,2 --> 0:22:54,6
would be changed to Planet
Purple Fairchilde in honor


512
0:22:54,6 --> 0:22:56,51
of the one who helped
them become different.


513
0:22:56,51 --> 0:22:59,99
Both Lady Elaine and Purple
Panda came to the celebration.


514
0:22:59,99 --> 0:23:3,2
The End."


515
0:23:3,2 --> 0:23:8,89
Now just think about it for
a minute as a business case.


516
0:23:8,89 --> 0:23:10,65
I think you'll be surprised.


517
0:23:10,65 --> 0:23:11,88
Go ahead Ian.


518
0:23:11,88 --> 0:23:14,41
IAN MITROFF: Here are some
of the principal lessons


519
0:23:14,41 --> 0:23:19,15
of Planet Purple translated into
the implications for business.


520
0:23:19,15 --> 0:23:21,64
In many ways the fable
is about waking up


521
0:23:21,64 --> 0:23:25,35
from an overly rigid,
hierarchical organization


522
0:23:25,35 --> 0:23:27,91
to a more equitable
organization.


523
0:23:27,91 --> 0:23:31,18
Let me give you some things that
aren't up there on the slide.


524
0:23:31,18 --> 0:23:33,85
Miss Fairchilde,
who could well be


525
0:23:33,85 --> 0:23:38,53
an executive VP, her
challenging assignment


526
0:23:38,53 --> 0:23:43,8
is explore different models for
the design of her organization.


527
0:23:43,8 --> 0:23:45,86
She comes across
Planet Purple, Inc.


528
0:23:45,86 --> 0:23:50,14
that has a beautiful simplicity,
but by just coming and asking


529
0:23:50,14 --> 0:23:54,53
questions, she's disturbed
the status quo profoundly.


530
0:23:54,53 --> 0:23:57,43
When she comes across the
organization, as I said,


531
0:23:57,43 --> 0:24:0,87
it's an old fashioned, overly
repressed organization.


532
0:24:0,87 --> 0:24:5,55
The employees are virtually in
a state of suspended, repressed


533
0:24:5,55 --> 0:24:7,76
psychological and
emotional development.


534
0:24:7,76 --> 0:24:10,39
There's a lack of integration
between thinking and feelings.


535
0:24:10,39 --> 0:24:14,76
That's one of the main
underlying themes of the story.


536
0:24:14,76 --> 0:24:17,31
In effect, the people
live in a cocoon.


537
0:24:17,31 --> 0:24:20,25
Planet Purple organizations,
as we well know,


538
0:24:20,25 --> 0:24:22,66
virtually have a single
measure of performance.


539
0:24:22,66 --> 0:24:24,93
All that matters
is the bottom line.


540
0:24:24,93 --> 0:24:28,88
In contrast, Planet
Prism organizations


541
0:24:28,88 --> 0:24:31,21
are a model of diversity.


542
0:24:31,21 --> 0:24:32,67
Everything is different.


543
0:24:32,67 --> 0:24:35,14
The King even enjoys--
the King Friday


544
0:24:35,14 --> 0:24:37,77
is the stand in for the
autocratic CEO-- even


545
0:24:37,77 --> 0:24:39,74
enjoys talking with employees.


546
0:24:39,74 --> 0:24:41,73
Yes, he's still in
charge because we're


547
0:24:41,73 --> 0:24:43,81
not against hierarchy, per se.


548
0:24:43,81 --> 0:24:45,6
That's not the point.


549
0:24:45,6 --> 0:24:48,19
But the point about the
Planet Prism organization,


550
0:24:48,19 --> 0:24:52,14
their primary goal is do
no harm to the planet,


551
0:24:52,14 --> 0:24:56,36
and make products that serve
authentic human needs, not


552
0:24:56,36 --> 0:24:57,98
false needs.


553
0:24:57,98 --> 0:24:59,916
Let's go on to the next fable.


554
0:24:59,916 --> 0:25:1,62
DONNA MITROFF:
OK, the Next story


555
0:25:1,62 --> 0:25:6,3
is "The Bass Violin
Festival." and this story


556
0:25:6,3 --> 0:25:11,61
we have paired with our topic of
one of our C's for creativity.


557
0:25:11,61 --> 0:25:14,61
So listen to this
one and think of how


558
0:25:14,61 --> 0:25:17,7
the lessons that this
has about creativity


559
0:25:17,7 --> 0:25:21,106
in your organizational life.


560
0:25:21,106 --> 0:25:22,98
"One day in the Neighborhood
of Make Believe,


561
0:25:22,98 --> 0:25:25,21
King Friday receives a
message from the mayor


562
0:25:25,21 --> 0:25:27,95
of an adjoining locality
saying that she would


563
0:25:27,95 --> 0:25:31,14
like to arrange a festival that
involves all of the surrounding


564
0:25:31,14 --> 0:25:32,21
neighborhoods.


565
0:25:32,21 --> 0:25:34,96
King Friday likes that idea
and immediately proclaims


566
0:25:34,96 --> 0:25:37,77
that it'll be a bass
violin festival.


567
0:25:37,77 --> 0:25:41,73
Chuck Aber, one of his subjects,
points out that he, the King,


568
0:25:41,73 --> 0:25:46,0
is the only one who actually
plays the bass violin.


569
0:25:46,0 --> 0:25:50,86
Undaunted by this, King
Friday says, oh, so I am.


570
0:25:50,86 --> 0:25:52,47
"King Friday's
subjects are pleased


571
0:25:52,47 --> 0:25:54,61
at the prospect of a joint
neighborhood festival,


572
0:25:54,61 --> 0:25:58,48
but quite taken aback that
it will be just a bass violin


573
0:25:58,48 --> 0:26:1,96
festival, and that they
must all participate.


574
0:26:1,96 --> 0:26:5,73
Lady Aberlin is
especially disconcerted


575
0:26:5,73 --> 0:26:9,38
when King Friday presents
her with a bass violin


576
0:26:9,38 --> 0:26:12,24
and tells her it's
a fine instrument.


577
0:26:12,24 --> 0:26:15,84
It was made by an
excellent instrument maker.


578
0:26:15,84 --> 0:26:19,82
She acknowledges that it may
be a very special bass violin.


579
0:26:19,82 --> 0:26:24,63
However, she says, I cannot
play the bass violin.


580
0:26:24,63 --> 0:26:28,14
Just because a person
has a fine instrument


581
0:26:28,14 --> 0:26:31,31
doesn't mean that he can
play that instrument well.


582
0:26:31,31 --> 0:26:35,56
King Friday simply tells her,
go on keep on practicing.


583
0:26:35,56 --> 0:26:37,98
"Over the next few
days, the subjects


584
0:26:37,98 --> 0:26:40,83
meet to share their frustration
about being required


585
0:26:40,83 --> 0:26:43,29
to perform a skill
they do not have.


586
0:26:43,29 --> 0:26:45,95
One day Lady Elaine Fairchilde
arrives and tells them


587
0:26:45,95 --> 0:26:48,11
she has a solution
to the problem."


588
0:26:48,11 --> 0:26:49,23
Remember Lady Elaine?


589
0:26:49,23 --> 0:26:52,82
She's the outspoken, gutsy one.


590
0:26:52,82 --> 0:26:55,5
"She produces her
accordion, the instrument


591
0:26:55,5 --> 0:26:59,87
that she plays very well, and
it is covered by a false front


592
0:26:59,87 --> 0:27:3,26
to make it look
like a bass violin.


593
0:27:3,26 --> 0:27:4,77
She tells them that
now she's going


594
0:27:4,77 --> 0:27:6,74
to play the bass
violin for them.


595
0:27:6,74 --> 0:27:9,69
They watch and
listen in amazement.


596
0:27:9,69 --> 0:27:12,87
Lady Aberlin then points
out that, you're actually


597
0:27:12,87 --> 0:27:14,4
playing your accordion.


598
0:27:14,4 --> 0:27:16,6
Lady Elaine acknowledges
it is an accordion.


599
0:27:16,6 --> 0:27:19,36
But since it looks
like a bass violin,


600
0:27:19,36 --> 0:27:22,87
it could work for The
Bass Violin Festival.


601
0:27:22,87 --> 0:27:25,64
"Lady Elaine's clever
solution gives the others


602
0:27:25,64 --> 0:27:27,35
an important idea.


603
0:27:27,35 --> 0:27:31,29
They could all think of ways
to make what they do look


604
0:27:31,29 --> 0:27:34,94
like bass violins so that could
contribute to the festival.


605
0:27:34,94 --> 0:27:36,89
Lady Aberlin knows how to dance.


606
0:27:36,89 --> 0:27:40,18
So she decides to dance
with the bass violin.


607
0:27:40,18 --> 0:27:44,17
Miss Paulifficate puts
on a bass violin costume


608
0:27:44,17 --> 0:27:47,79
and plays at being
a bass violin.


609
0:27:47,79 --> 0:27:52,62
Keith and Michael Jones
make bass violin puppets


610
0:27:52,62 --> 0:27:56,14
who will perform a bass
violin conversation.


611
0:27:56,14 --> 0:28:1,62
Another neighbor dresses up as a
special flower, a bass vio-let.


612
0:28:1,62 --> 0:28:4,44
And yet another one
decides to write and recite


613
0:28:4,44 --> 0:28:7,214
a poem about the bass violin.


614
0:28:7,214 --> 0:28:8,63
"In the midst of
their excitement,


615
0:28:8,63 --> 0:28:10,48
they realize that
King Friday needs


616
0:28:10,48 --> 0:28:12,59
to be told what
they're going to do.


617
0:28:12,59 --> 0:28:15,99
They become a little worried
that he may not like the news.


618
0:28:15,99 --> 0:28:18,52
Lady Aberlin confides
to Daniel Tiger.


619
0:28:18,52 --> 0:28:21,16
And Daniel says,
the best thing to do


620
0:28:21,16 --> 0:28:24,11
is tell the King the truth,
that not everybody can learn


621
0:28:24,11 --> 0:28:26,18
to play the bass
violin so they're


622
0:28:26,18 --> 0:28:28,49
going to do other
things with it, things


623
0:28:28,49 --> 0:28:30,16
that they can do well.


624
0:28:30,16 --> 0:28:31,7
With the support
and encouragement


625
0:28:31,7 --> 0:28:35,76
of all her friends Lady Aberlin
tells King Friday the truth.


626
0:28:35,76 --> 0:28:38,31
He listens to the
plan and concludes


627
0:28:38,31 --> 0:28:41,83
that these are very clever
ideas and perhaps this festival


628
0:28:41,83 --> 0:28:44,3
could turn out to be
something special.


629
0:28:44,3 --> 0:28:45,7
And indeed it is.


630
0:28:45,7 --> 0:28:48,64
The very, very
special Bass Violin


631
0:28:48,64 --> 0:28:51,94
Festival where
everyone contributes


632
0:28:51,94 --> 0:28:56,9
with his or her own
special talent."


633
0:28:56,9 --> 0:29:0,5
IAN MITROFF: OK, let me go over
the lessons briefly of "The


634
0:29:0,5 --> 0:29:4,47
Bass Violin" and it is really
one of my favorite stories out


635
0:29:4,47 --> 0:29:5,28
of Fred's.


636
0:29:5,28 --> 0:29:8,41
That number one, technology--
particularly talking


637
0:29:8,41 --> 0:29:11,48
to a technology company-- is
never a substitute for skill.


638
0:29:11,48 --> 0:29:13,444
The fact that King
Friday is an expert,


639
0:29:13,444 --> 0:29:15,61
you can't assume that
everybody else will take to it


640
0:29:15,61 --> 0:29:17,41
and become an expert.


641
0:29:17,41 --> 0:29:20,31
Number two, technology
often increases our fears.


642
0:29:20,31 --> 0:29:21,55
We all know that.


643
0:29:21,55 --> 0:29:24,39
It makes us feel painfully
aware of our shortcomings,


644
0:29:24,39 --> 0:29:26,45
so increases anxiety.


645
0:29:26,45 --> 0:29:27,96
Three, often we're afraid.


646
0:29:27,96 --> 0:29:31,2
Indeed the more we are, we
project our fears on others.


647
0:29:31,2 --> 0:29:33,95
See for all we
know in the fable,


648
0:29:33,95 --> 0:29:36,76
King Friday may have
given the assignment


649
0:29:36,76 --> 0:29:40,33
to see if his employees-- take
the metaphor employees-- would


650
0:29:40,33 --> 0:29:42,62
break out and become creative.


651
0:29:42,62 --> 0:29:45,78
Because the fable, in many
ways, is about re-framing,


652
0:29:45,78 --> 0:29:48,2
taking the initial
assignment, which


653
0:29:48,2 --> 0:29:50,71
may be impossible
to solve on its own.


654
0:29:50,71 --> 0:29:53,91
Creativity forces us to
confront our deepest fears.


655
0:29:53,91 --> 0:29:56,72
Will we be foolish and
laughed at if we expose


656
0:29:56,72 --> 0:29:58,97
or ideas and feelings
to the world?


657
0:29:58,97 --> 0:30:3,81
To be creative we
have to be childlike,


658
0:30:3,81 --> 0:30:4,97
without being childish.


659
0:30:4,97 --> 0:30:6,76
Last thing let me
talk to you about.


660
0:30:6,76 --> 0:30:10,61
Those of you who've taken
courses in statistics


661
0:30:10,61 --> 0:30:14,83
early on learn about two errors,
type one and type two errors.


662
0:30:14,83 --> 0:30:16,13
I won't go through them.


663
0:30:16,13 --> 0:30:18,65
If you've taken a class,
you know what it is.


664
0:30:18,65 --> 0:30:21,84
There's an error that is
virtually never talked about,


665
0:30:21,84 --> 0:30:23,8
which is most fundamental.


666
0:30:23,8 --> 0:30:24,63
It's the type three error.


667
0:30:24,63 --> 0:30:27,876
The type three error is solving
the wrong problem precisely.


668
0:30:27,876 --> 0:30:29,5
I'm sure you can all
connect with that.


669
0:30:29,5 --> 0:30:32,46
Solving the wrong
problem precisely.


670
0:30:32,46 --> 0:30:35,62
To know that we're not solving
the wrong problem precisely,


671
0:30:35,62 --> 0:30:39,7
what we have to do is have
at least two different ways


672
0:30:39,7 --> 0:30:40,9
of looking at a problem.


673
0:30:40,9 --> 0:30:42,0
If you have only
one alternative,


674
0:30:42,0 --> 0:30:43,8
that's really a
set up that you're


675
0:30:43,8 --> 0:30:45,23
going to solve
the wrong problem.


676
0:30:45,23 --> 0:30:47,42
And that's really what
the fable is about.


677
0:30:47,42 --> 0:30:49,72
And that's what we
talk about in the book.


678
0:30:49,72 --> 0:30:51,59
Let me go on to the next slide.


679
0:30:51,59 --> 0:30:52,85
DONNA MITROFF: You can
imagine that if they


680
0:30:52,85 --> 0:30:55,96
had taken the
assignment directly


681
0:30:55,96 --> 0:30:59,32
and all tried to learn to
play the bass violin in time


682
0:30:59,32 --> 0:31:0,96
for the festival,
they would have


683
0:31:0,96 --> 0:31:4,95
been very successful at solving
the wrong problem precisely.


684
0:31:4,95 --> 0:31:8,9
They would have committed
the error of the third kind.


685
0:31:8,9 --> 0:31:9,6
IAN MITROFF: OK,
we're near the end


686
0:31:9,6 --> 0:31:10,808
here where our time with you.


687
0:31:10,808 --> 0:31:13,34
But I'm just going to
talk about very briefly


688
0:31:13,34 --> 0:31:14,83
what the rest of the book does.


689
0:31:14,83 --> 0:31:19,424
We apply the fables and we
bring in some topics that


690
0:31:19,424 --> 0:31:21,465
are both talked about and
really not talked about


691
0:31:21,465 --> 0:31:22,77
in business schools.


692
0:31:22,77 --> 0:31:24,57
For example, life skills.


693
0:31:24,57 --> 0:31:27,3
Ellen Galinsky who has gone
around the country and talk


694
0:31:27,3 --> 0:31:30,29
with investigators who
study young children.


695
0:31:30,29 --> 0:31:33,51
What are the key skills that
kids need to learn early


696
0:31:33,51 --> 0:31:36,41
and we need to emphasize them
throughout our whole lives.


697
0:31:36,41 --> 0:31:40,3
I've worked with a friend
who's developed a marvelous


698
0:31:40,3 --> 0:31:43,65
instrument for getting how to
help people handle conflict.


699
0:31:43,65 --> 0:31:45,51
Defense mechanisms.


700
0:31:45,51 --> 0:31:47,56
One of the earliest
discoveries of Freud.


701
0:31:47,56 --> 0:31:49,94
If the defense
mechanisms are high,


702
0:31:49,94 --> 0:31:53,61
like denial, you can't do any
of this in an organization.


703
0:31:53,61 --> 0:31:54,7
Personality styles.


704
0:31:54,7 --> 0:31:56,33
We talk about the Myers Briggs.


705
0:31:56,33 --> 0:31:59,26
Number five, I've worked my
pretty much my whole career


706
0:31:59,26 --> 0:32:2,19
as one of the developers
of crisis management.


707
0:32:2,19 --> 0:32:5,42
Years ago, starting with
the first Tylenol poisoning,


708
0:32:5,42 --> 0:32:7,86
I moved into the field
of crisis management.


709
0:32:7,86 --> 0:32:10,12
And lastly, I don't know
how many of you have ever


710
0:32:10,12 --> 0:32:11,83
heard of attachment theory.


711
0:32:11,83 --> 0:32:15,41
But it's one of the most
profound theories about how


712
0:32:15,41 --> 0:32:18,46
we build trust early
on in our lives.


713
0:32:18,46 --> 0:32:20,64
Attachment theory
provides really


714
0:32:20,64 --> 0:32:23,65
the basic models of trust
that go back literally


715
0:32:23,65 --> 0:32:25,2
from the day we are born.


716
0:32:25,2 --> 0:32:29,1
The interactions with
our primary caregivers.


717
0:32:29,1 --> 0:32:31,93
So the point about
the book, I guess,


718
0:32:31,93 --> 0:32:37,1
Donna said it before,
but let me say it again,


719
0:32:37,1 --> 0:32:39,18
if we had to summarize
the book in one line


720
0:32:39,18 --> 0:32:42,99
it would be that, Fred helped
you when you were a child,


721
0:32:42,99 --> 0:32:44,95
he can help you when
you're an adult.


722
0:32:44,95 --> 0:32:49,13
Because the lessons of Fred,
the stories, are so finely hewn,


723
0:32:49,13 --> 0:32:51,85
they're so finely
crafted that they really


724
0:32:51,85 --> 0:32:55,2
reverberate throughout
our entire lives.


725
0:32:55,2 --> 0:32:58,3
Now, we were lucky to find a
publisher, Palgrave McMillan,


726
0:32:58,3 --> 0:33:4,1
an academic publisher, and
they started a new series


727
0:33:4,1 --> 0:33:6,45
to teach organizational
behavior.


728
0:33:6,45 --> 0:33:9,21
They had people,
such as us, write


729
0:33:9,21 --> 0:33:12,5
books that would teach
organizational behavior


730
0:33:12,5 --> 0:33:13,99
through stories and fables.


731
0:33:13,99 --> 0:33:18,74
And we were lucky to be one of
the first books in the series.


732
0:33:18,74 --> 0:33:21,8
DONNA MITROFF: Talk
about the book.


733
0:33:21,8 --> 0:33:23,585
How they positioned
it and market it.


734
0:33:23,585 --> 0:33:25,25
And it is a textbook.


735
0:33:25,25 --> 0:33:27,41
IAN MITROFF: It's a
supplementary textbook


736
0:33:27,41 --> 0:33:29,7
because it's not out
of the mainstream.


737
0:33:29,7 --> 0:33:32,3
Hopefully, telling
stories in fables


738
0:33:32,3 --> 0:33:33,7
will move more in
the mainstream,


739
0:33:33,7 --> 0:33:34,685
how we teach business.


740
0:33:34,685 --> 0:33:36,589



741
0:33:36,589 --> 0:33:38,13
DONNA MITROFF: But
I just want to say


742
0:33:38,13 --> 0:33:42,93
what you'll see if you read
the book, it's in three parts.


743
0:33:42,93 --> 0:33:46,255
Part one, is we just
tell you the stories


744
0:33:46,255 --> 0:33:49,51
and we ask you to
think about them.


745
0:33:49,51 --> 0:33:54,7
Part two, we go back and analyze
each of these seven stories


746
0:33:54,7 --> 0:33:56,31
in some detail.


747
0:33:56,31 --> 0:34:1,26
And then in part three, is
the real academic application.


748
0:34:1,26 --> 0:34:4,93
And that's where we bring
in all of these other areas


749
0:34:4,93 --> 0:34:7,17
and we provide exercises.


750
0:34:7,17 --> 0:34:10,51
And we know the book is
being adopted by some faculty


751
0:34:10,51 --> 0:34:12,1
members around the
country and being


752
0:34:12,1 --> 0:34:15,37
used in management
classes, but not enough.


753
0:34:15,37 --> 0:34:17,67
And it's the kind
of thing that if you


754
0:34:17,67 --> 0:34:21,35
wanted to start a group
of your own, read the book


755
0:34:21,35 --> 0:34:25,85
and talk about it, the ideas
are there for how you can.


756
0:34:25,85 --> 0:34:28,409
IAN MITROFF: But at this
point we need to stop.


757
0:34:28,409 --> 0:34:30,8
We have a few questions for you.


758
0:34:30,8 --> 0:34:31,73
And I'm sure you have questions.


759
0:34:31,73 --> 0:34:36,71
One of Fred's, we think,
profound ways in which you


760
0:34:36,71 --> 0:34:41,62
would end, even start a meeting
was said, close your eyes.


761
0:34:41,62 --> 0:34:44,33
So everybody close your eyes.


762
0:34:44,33 --> 0:34:49,6
And think about who is
the person or persons that


763
0:34:49,6 --> 0:34:51,699
were most impactful
on your career.


764
0:34:51,699 --> 0:34:56,6
I think the way Fred put
it, willed you in to being.


765
0:34:56,6 --> 0:34:58,46
And the second thing we
would ask you to think about


766
0:34:58,46 --> 0:35:3,55
is, what have you heard
today that you can carry back


767
0:35:3,55 --> 0:35:7,77
directly into your
jobs to make your life


768
0:35:7,77 --> 0:35:10,63
and the life of your
colleagues better.


769
0:35:10,63 --> 0:35:12,13
We'll take a few seconds.


770
0:35:12,13 --> 0:35:13,145
Keep your eyes closed.


771
0:35:13,145 --> 0:35:19,67



772
0:35:19,67 --> 0:35:22,1
OK, floor is open for you.


773
0:35:22,1 --> 0:35:23,952
Any questions, comments.


774
0:35:23,952 --> 0:35:25,493
DONNA MITROFF: Any
thoughts that came


775
0:35:25,493 --> 0:35:28,28
to you during that
eyes closed moment.


776
0:35:28,28 --> 0:35:30,6
We'd like for this
to be a conversation.


777
0:35:30,6 --> 0:35:37,59
So anyone who wants to
say anything about a story


778
0:35:37,59 --> 0:35:42,68
like this being applied to your
organization, or any thoughts.


779
0:35:42,68 --> 0:35:43,33
Yeah?


780
0:35:43,33 --> 0:35:44,4
AUDIENCE: Hi.


781
0:35:44,4 --> 0:35:47,93
I found it fascinating that
the Planet Purple people felt,


782
0:35:47,93 --> 0:35:51,9
or believe, that they could
travel just by thinking.


783
0:35:51,9 --> 0:35:53,37
And what I brought
back from that is,


784
0:35:53,37 --> 0:35:56,11
I tend to be an ideas person.


785
0:35:56,11 --> 0:35:58,18
But if you really want
to carry an idea through,


786
0:35:58,18 --> 0:35:59,721
you have to be
committed to the steps


787
0:35:59,721 --> 0:36:1,4
that it takes to
bring it to fruition.


788
0:36:1,4 --> 0:36:4,446
You can't just think about
it and say, it's done.


789
0:36:4,446 --> 0:36:6,79
DONNA MITROFF: That's very good.


790
0:36:6,79 --> 0:36:7,59
That's very good.


791
0:36:7,59 --> 0:36:9,0
Very interesting.


792
0:36:9,0 --> 0:36:11,28
IAN MITROFF: Well, I mean,
what you said-- yeah,


793
0:36:11,28 --> 0:36:13,72
I'm primarily a
thinking person too,


794
0:36:13,72 --> 0:36:16,11
going through engineering,
philosophy of science.


795
0:36:16,11 --> 0:36:20,67
But the point is that we
don't sell ideas alone just


796
0:36:20,67 --> 0:36:21,98
through the ideas.


797
0:36:21,98 --> 0:36:23,195
We sell them through stories.


798
0:36:23,195 --> 0:36:27,19
I mean think about the leaders
who were most effective.


799
0:36:27,19 --> 0:36:29,28
Whether you like President
Clinton or Obama,


800
0:36:29,28 --> 0:36:30,52
they have a story.


801
0:36:30,52 --> 0:36:34,34
Even George W. Bush, OK,
I didn't agree with him,


802
0:36:34,34 --> 0:36:35,85
but he had a story.


803
0:36:35,85 --> 0:36:37,6
And he was effective that way.


804
0:36:37,6 --> 0:36:39,76
So the most effective
leaders have


805
0:36:39,76 --> 0:36:42,565
a way of encapsulating
the lessons


806
0:36:42,565 --> 0:36:44,28
into something that moves us.


807
0:36:44,28 --> 0:36:47,93
Because ideas alone,
Yeah, they're necessary,


808
0:36:47,93 --> 0:36:49,26
but they're not sufficient.


809
0:36:49,26 --> 0:36:52,14
And that's the point
why we did the book.


810
0:36:52,14 --> 0:36:53,43
DONNA MITROFF: And
the other point


811
0:36:53,43 --> 0:36:58,32
of the thinking way of traveling
is that you only use your mind.


812
0:36:58,32 --> 0:37:0,96



813
0:37:0,96 --> 0:37:2,37
You leave your body.


814
0:37:2,37 --> 0:37:4,6
You don't use it.


815
0:37:4,6 --> 0:37:6,76
You can't do that.


816
0:37:6,76 --> 0:37:9,1
You have to integrate
your mind, and your body,


817
0:37:9,1 --> 0:37:12,241
and your spirit to really
accomplish anything.


818
0:37:12,241 --> 0:37:12,74
Yeah.


819
0:37:12,74 --> 0:37:14,6
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering
about the process


820
0:37:14,6 --> 0:37:16,496
of building stories.


821
0:37:16,496 --> 0:37:18,37
Because there's a very
creative aspect to it,


822
0:37:18,37 --> 0:37:21,89
but there's also the taking
what you want to get across


823
0:37:21,89 --> 0:37:25,32
and communicating
it effectively.


824
0:37:25,32 --> 0:37:28,25
And sometimes you can
be very, very creative


825
0:37:28,25 --> 0:37:31,405
and no one understands
what you're talking about.


826
0:37:31,405 --> 0:37:33,53
Other times, you could be
very clear on what you're


827
0:37:33,53 --> 0:37:39,18
talking about, but the story
is banal or are not compelling.


828
0:37:39,18 --> 0:37:41,99
And I'm wondering if you guys
have any insight in terms


829
0:37:41,99 --> 0:37:46,92
of Mr. Rogers' process on how
he got from what he wanted


830
0:37:46,92 --> 0:37:48,405
to get across and into a story.


831
0:37:48,405 --> 0:37:52,3
IAN MITROFF: David do you have
any idea what the process was


832
0:37:52,3 --> 0:37:53,85
that Fred went through?


833
0:37:53,85 --> 0:38:1,56
DAVID NEWELL: It was based a
lot on letters from the public.


834
0:38:1,56 --> 0:38:3,71
This is not exactly
answering your question,


835
0:38:3,71 --> 0:38:8,84
but the most requested topic
we ever had over the years


836
0:38:8,84 --> 0:38:12,19
was from people
talking about Fred


837
0:38:12,19 --> 0:38:15,6
helping their
families with divorce.


838
0:38:15,6 --> 0:38:22,4
And we got so many-- and this
is going back maybe 20 years--


839
0:38:22,4 --> 0:38:24,43
and Fred didn't
know how to do it.


840
0:38:24,43 --> 0:38:29,16
And finally-- he had a
professional child development


841
0:38:29,16 --> 0:38:32,19
expert with him all the
time-- and they finally


842
0:38:32,19 --> 0:38:34,24
came up with a concept.


843
0:38:34,24 --> 0:38:36,25
And we did a whole
week on divorce.


844
0:38:36,25 --> 0:38:38,57
And the one thing
that Fred wanted


845
0:38:38,57 --> 0:38:41,86
to get across to children was
that it's not their fault.


846
0:38:41,86 --> 0:38:44,47



847
0:38:44,47 --> 0:38:47,6
So it evolved like that.


848
0:38:47,6 --> 0:38:50,39
Another time, much
more light hearted,


849
0:38:50,39 --> 0:38:54,56
there was a time when we
did a week on superheroes.


850
0:38:54,56 --> 0:38:59,26
I had seen an article where a
child thought he was Superman,


851
0:38:59,26 --> 0:39:2,52
put a towel around his neck,
and jumped off a building,


852
0:39:2,52 --> 0:39:3,36
and killed himself.


853
0:39:3,36 --> 0:39:4,92
And that was going on.


854
0:39:4,92 --> 0:39:7,77
And so we went to
"The Incredible Hulk,"


855
0:39:7,77 --> 0:39:8,83
watching it being filmed.


856
0:39:8,83 --> 0:39:10,39
Remember "The Incredible Hulk?"


857
0:39:10,39 --> 0:39:16,16
We went to Universal Studios
and showed that this is pretend.


858
0:39:16,16 --> 0:39:18,1
Here's this person
getting into his makeup.


859
0:39:18,1 --> 0:39:19,76
He broke it down.


860
0:39:19,76 --> 0:39:21,0
And Fred thought that way.


861
0:39:21,0 --> 0:39:23,85
He wanted to demystify a
lot of different things.


862
0:39:23,85 --> 0:39:27,42
But does that answer
your question?


863
0:39:27,42 --> 0:39:31,87
The creativity came a lot
of times from the public.


864
0:39:31,87 --> 0:39:36,5
But a lot, like "The
Bass Violin Festival."


865
0:39:36,5 --> 0:39:38,14
it came from Fred's
love of music, too.


866
0:39:38,14 --> 0:39:41,13
He used that as a metaphor of
sorts to get that point across.


867
0:39:41,13 --> 0:39:43,54
So it came from many
different places.


868
0:39:43,54 --> 0:39:44,22
Do you have anything to add?


869
0:39:44,22 --> 0:39:48,22
IAN MITROFF: One other
response, the kind of philosophy


870
0:39:48,22 --> 0:39:51,24
I studied was really in the
school of pragmatism, William


871
0:39:51,24 --> 0:39:52,53
James.


872
0:39:52,53 --> 0:39:57,345
If you read the opening
pages of "Pragmatism", one


873
0:39:57,345 --> 0:40:0,64
of William James' key
works, he tells a story,


874
0:40:0,64 --> 0:40:3,82
it's a brief story
about a working man, who


875
0:40:3,82 --> 0:40:5,44
had been out of work for a year.


876
0:40:5,44 --> 0:40:8,3
He finally got a job
in physical labor.


877
0:40:8,3 --> 0:40:9,21
But he was hurt.


878
0:40:9,21 --> 0:40:10,67
He was weak.


879
0:40:10,67 --> 0:40:13,8
He couldn't do it
so we came home.


880
0:40:13,8 --> 0:40:17,17
He killed his family
and he killed himself.


881
0:40:17,17 --> 0:40:20,18
And William James-- you know it
was ripped from the headlines--


882
0:40:20,18 --> 0:40:23,81
and William James asked
what does philosophy


883
0:40:23,81 --> 0:40:24,76
have to say to this?


884
0:40:24,76 --> 0:40:28,9
If it has nothing to say,
it has nothing to say.


885
0:40:28,9 --> 0:40:30,59
And so the point
is, you know, I mean


886
0:40:30,59 --> 0:40:33,1
I've written scores of books.


887
0:40:33,1 --> 0:40:36,72
You've got wherever you
find the story-- I'm


888
0:40:36,72 --> 0:40:38,79
working on a book
with my in-law,


889
0:40:38,79 --> 0:40:41,44
the father of my son-in-law.


890
0:40:41,44 --> 0:40:45,101
And he's a retired
bio-stat guy from Stanford.


891
0:40:45,101 --> 0:40:47,1
And we're talking about
writing a book on health


892
0:40:47,1 --> 0:40:50,6
for the public, the kind
of concerns they have.


893
0:40:50,6 --> 0:40:54,29
He worked with Michael DeBakey
and I keep saying, Abe, we've


894
0:40:54,29 --> 0:40:56,41
got to crystallize the stories.


895
0:40:56,41 --> 0:40:59,8
For every point that
we want to make,


896
0:40:59,8 --> 0:41:2,24
there has to be an
accompanying story.


897
0:41:2,24 --> 0:41:5,21
See one of things they didn't
say earlier about fables


898
0:41:5,21 --> 0:41:6,73
and why we went with fables.


899
0:41:6,73 --> 0:41:9,76
The reason why
fables reverberate,


900
0:41:9,76 --> 0:41:13,81
they're stereotypes, but
the good guys and bad guys


901
0:41:13,81 --> 0:41:15,33
are clearly drawn.


902
0:41:15,33 --> 0:41:17,72
That's why we were
drawn to fables.


903
0:41:17,72 --> 0:41:20,79
And the moral lessons are clear.


904
0:41:20,79 --> 0:41:22,34
Now you get into stereotype.


905
0:41:22,34 --> 0:41:23,53
You can exaggerate.


906
0:41:23,53 --> 0:41:25,13
But that's what fables do.


907
0:41:25,13 --> 0:41:28,18
So they cut through
all the stuff there,


908
0:41:28,18 --> 0:41:29,93
and they make it come to life.


909
0:41:29,93 --> 0:41:31,31
They're human.


910
0:41:31,31 --> 0:41:32,705
And you don't get
that, you know?


911
0:41:32,705 --> 0:41:33,734
I mean come on.


912
0:41:33,734 --> 0:41:34,4
I'm an academic.


913
0:41:34,4 --> 0:41:36,483
I've been in the academic
world for my whole life.


914
0:41:36,483 --> 0:41:40,24
You're not rewarded
for doing that.


915
0:41:40,24 --> 0:41:44,74
And there's so like all the
idea stuff, that's necessary.


916
0:41:44,74 --> 0:41:47,87
But it's not sufficient to
get it out here to the world.


917
0:41:47,87 --> 0:41:51,45
And that's why we wrote the book
because what a challenge for us


918
0:41:51,45 --> 0:41:53,31
to do what you were asking.


919
0:41:53,31 --> 0:41:54,6
Anybody else?


920
0:41:54,6 --> 0:41:55,23
We have a few minutes.


921
0:41:55,23 --> 0:41:58,15
Yes, sir.


922
0:41:58,15 --> 0:41:59,72
AUDIENCE: I think
it's a great concept


923
0:41:59,72 --> 0:42:1,48
to apply these lessons
to the workplace.


924
0:42:1,48 --> 0:42:4,51
Of course, you guys actually
shared the workplace


925
0:42:4,51 --> 0:42:5,57
with Fred Rogers.


926
0:42:5,57 --> 0:42:8,34
I'm curious what was
that workplace like.


927
0:42:8,34 --> 0:42:9,89
Was it any different?


928
0:42:9,89 --> 0:42:12,8
I loved your story of
actually closing your eyes.


929
0:42:12,8 --> 0:42:14,29
Are there more
examples like that?


930
0:42:14,29 --> 0:42:18,2



931
0:42:18,2 --> 0:42:22,55
DONNA MITROFF: It was chaotic.


932
0:42:22,55 --> 0:42:26,64
It was always
bubbling and jumping


933
0:42:26,64 --> 0:42:29,42
and things were happening and
things didn't get done on time.


934
0:42:29,42 --> 0:42:32,29



935
0:42:32,29 --> 0:42:34,31
Some recognition up here.


936
0:42:34,31 --> 0:42:37,99
But there was always that
underlying current of we


937
0:42:37,99 --> 0:42:39,96
know where we're going.


938
0:42:39,96 --> 0:42:42,48
This is about
something important.


939
0:42:42,48 --> 0:42:46,18
And that's the thing that kept
everybody coming back together.


940
0:42:46,18 --> 0:42:48,41
Now the day-to-day stories?


941
0:42:48,41 --> 0:42:50,51
David has piles of those.


942
0:42:50,51 --> 0:42:52,51
DAVID NEWELL: I was in
every one of the tapings.


943
0:42:52,51 --> 0:42:56,96
We did over thousands of
tapings and I was in them a lot.


944
0:42:56,96 --> 0:43:0,73
And the one time that you could
tell-- Fred was a musician--


945
0:43:0,73 --> 0:43:4,79
and you could tell
when he was frustrated.


946
0:43:4,79 --> 0:43:7,9
He would never yell or throw
a sneaker across the floor.


947
0:43:7,9 --> 0:43:9,68
He would go to the piano.


948
0:43:9,68 --> 0:43:12,0
And when we sat
down at the piano


949
0:43:12,0 --> 0:43:15,6
and would play the piano
that was his-- anger


950
0:43:15,6 --> 0:43:18,49
came out through his
fingers or his frustrations.


951
0:43:18,49 --> 0:43:19,86
And that's how he dealt with it.


952
0:43:19,86 --> 0:43:21,51
And people would
follow that, too.


953
0:43:21,51 --> 0:43:24,35
They knew that Fred
was saying something


954
0:43:24,35 --> 0:43:26,48
to them when the
piano would start.


955
0:43:26,48 --> 0:43:30,47
And after every taping
Fred had a tradition,


956
0:43:30,47 --> 0:43:32,35
he'd go to the piano
and-- you're all


957
0:43:32,35 --> 0:43:35,9
too young to know up it, but in
the movie theaters in the '40s


958
0:43:35,9 --> 0:43:37,5
and '50s, they had newsreels.


959
0:43:37,5 --> 0:43:39,82
And there was a news
reel that started out


960
0:43:39,82 --> 0:43:41,67
with a rooster crowing.


961
0:43:41,67 --> 0:43:43,9
It as the RKO Warner
Brothers News,


962
0:43:43,9 --> 0:43:47,11
something that had a
very distinct theme.


963
0:43:47,11 --> 0:43:48,53
Da, da, da dat da da.


964
0:43:48,53 --> 0:43:51,77
It's like playing "And That's
All Folks" from Looney Tunes.


965
0:43:51,77 --> 0:43:54,85
He would sit down and play that,
and we knew the day was done.


966
0:43:54,85 --> 0:43:57,51
But Fred talked through music.


967
0:43:57,51 --> 0:43:59,389
DONNA MITROFF: He talked
through music, yeah.


968
0:43:59,389 --> 0:44:1,18
IAN MITROFF: One thing
that I do remember--


969
0:44:1,18 --> 0:44:3,67
I'll get the story a little
bit wrong, not exactly.


970
0:44:3,67 --> 0:44:7,8
I remember watching Fred one
time on the old "Johnny Carson


971
0:44:7,8 --> 0:44:7,58
Show."


972
0:44:7,58 --> 0:44:10,39
I don't how many of you watched
the old "Johnny Carson Show."


973
0:44:10,39 --> 0:44:13,53
And Fred was talking
about what he did.


974
0:44:13,53 --> 0:44:16,1
Johnny, they were
engaged in conversation.


975
0:44:16,1 --> 0:44:19,52
And Fred was talking about
the importance of children's


976
0:44:19,52 --> 0:44:22,48
feelings, and somebody
in the audience guffawed.


977
0:44:22,48 --> 0:44:25,72
And Fred looked at that
person steely cold and said,


978
0:44:25,72 --> 0:44:27,6
that's not funny.


979
0:44:27,6 --> 0:44:29,42
And I remember that
because, again,


980
0:44:29,42 --> 0:44:33,17
to think that OK, he was
bubbly and light all the time.


981
0:44:33,17 --> 0:44:33,99
No way.


982
0:44:33,99 --> 0:44:36,58
I mean, yes, this
was a spiritual,


983
0:44:36,58 --> 0:44:38,36
a really good person.


984
0:44:38,36 --> 0:44:40,39
But the things that
he didn't have strong


985
0:44:40,39 --> 0:44:43,22
values-- In fact, we
talked about that.


986
0:44:43,22 --> 0:44:46,42
This was more than a
one time occurrence.


987
0:44:46,42 --> 0:44:50,81
I know when I've
been involved-- I'm


988
0:44:50,81 --> 0:44:53,4
in a research
center at Berkeley--


989
0:44:53,4 --> 0:44:56,97
and we have people come in and
they'll talk about feelings--


990
0:44:56,97 --> 0:44:59,93
because it's a center about
crises and everything--


991
0:44:59,93 --> 0:45:2,14
they'll talk about warm fuzzies.


992
0:45:2,14 --> 0:45:5,38
I have to bite my tongue
and I can't always do it.


993
0:45:5,38 --> 0:45:8,54
And say, don't you
insult feelings that way.


994
0:45:8,54 --> 0:45:10,124
You don't do that with a kid.


995
0:45:10,124 --> 0:45:11,415
DONNA MITROFF: Or with anybody.


996
0:45:11,415 --> 0:45:11,69
IAN MITROFF: Or with anybody.


997
0:45:11,69 --> 0:45:13,77
DONNA MITROFF: Because
you bring those feelings


998
0:45:13,77 --> 0:45:16,86
with you no matter what.


999
0:45:16,86 --> 0:45:19,2
And they have to be dealt
with no matter where you are,


1000
0:45:19,2 --> 0:45:21,23
no matter what age you are,
they have to be dealt with.


1001
0:45:21,23 --> 0:45:22,813
IAN MITROFF: One of
the things I found


1002
0:45:22,813 --> 0:45:25,2
when I did my book on
spiritually was called


1003
0:45:25,2 --> 0:45:27,36
"The Spiritual Audit
of Corporate America,"


1004
0:45:27,36 --> 0:45:30,13
that one of the things
that people talk about what


1005
0:45:30,13 --> 0:45:32,76
spirituality meant
to them at work


1006
0:45:32,76 --> 0:45:34,33
was how much of
their whole person


1007
0:45:34,33 --> 0:45:35,371
they could bring to work.


1008
0:45:35,371 --> 0:45:37,26
Could they only bring
their head, but not


1009
0:45:37,26 --> 0:45:39,78
your their feelings, their
heart, and their body.


1010
0:45:39,78 --> 0:45:43,19
And so the whole point is, we're
fragmented enough in our lives


1011
0:45:43,19 --> 0:45:45,56
that they didn't want to be
further fragmented at work.


1012
0:45:45,56 --> 0:45:48,18
Or to go home and repair
for all the beating


1013
0:45:48,18 --> 0:45:49,726
up that they took
during the week.


1014
0:45:49,726 --> 0:45:51,85
And then go home and repair
so they could come back


1015
0:45:51,85 --> 0:45:54,23
and take another
40, 50 hours more.


1016
0:45:54,23 --> 0:45:57,87
So the organizations that quote
have a spiritual bent, whatever


1017
0:45:57,87 --> 0:46:1,2
you want to call it, get
more of the whole person.


1018
0:46:1,2 --> 0:46:3,6
They don't exploit that person.


1019
0:46:3,6 --> 0:46:5,64
And they get more
of the creativity.


1020
0:46:5,64 --> 0:46:8,98
That's why all of these
fables really reverberate.


1021
0:46:8,98 --> 0:46:10,966
OK, I think we
have time for more.


1022
0:46:10,966 --> 0:46:12,59
DONNA MITROFF: Do we
any time Courtney?


1023
0:46:12,59 --> 0:46:13,756
COURTNEY: One more question.


1024
0:46:13,756 --> 0:46:17,1
DAVID NEWELL: Can I follow
up with what you asked?


1025
0:46:17,1 --> 0:46:19,7
This just shows
Fred's sense of humor.


1026
0:46:19,7 --> 0:46:22,19
He had a wonderful
sense of humor.


1027
0:46:22,19 --> 0:46:23,13
The crew knew this.


1028
0:46:23,13 --> 0:46:25,95
You know how he changed
his shoes and sneakers


1029
0:46:25,95 --> 0:46:27,31
and put his--?


1030
0:46:27,31 --> 0:46:29,16
At the very end of
the program, they


1031
0:46:29,16 --> 0:46:32,8
snuck in a pair
of smaller shoes.


1032
0:46:32,8 --> 0:46:36,17
And he put his shoe on
by talking and winding


1033
0:46:36,17 --> 0:46:37,1
his foot into it.


1034
0:46:37,1 --> 0:46:37,99
And he couldn't do it.


1035
0:46:37,99 --> 0:46:39,33
And he couldn't do it.


1036
0:46:39,33 --> 0:46:41,65
And you heard the
crew started to laugh.


1037
0:46:41,65 --> 0:46:44,4



1038
0:46:44,4 --> 0:46:46,47
He wore a size 10, and
they gave him size 8.


1039
0:46:46,47 --> 0:46:48,47
You can't tell just
by looking at it.


1040
0:46:48,47 --> 0:46:51,97
And he thought
that was so funny.


1041
0:46:51,97 --> 0:46:55,98
And it Dick Clark showed
it on his outtake reels.


1042
0:46:55,98 --> 0:46:58,5
Just one other quicky.


1043
0:46:58,5 --> 0:47:1,11
You know those blow up dolls?


1044
0:47:1,11 --> 0:47:3,83
This is something that nobody's
ever told anyone, but I will.


1045
0:47:3,83 --> 0:47:6,347
[LAUGHTER]


1046
0:47:6,347 --> 0:47:8,43
They said, OK, Fred, we're
going to start to show.


1047
0:47:8,43 --> 0:47:10,346
He came in, sang the
song, put the sweater on,


1048
0:47:10,346 --> 0:47:12,48
went to the cupboard,
and there was a blow up


1049
0:47:12,48 --> 0:47:15,1
doll hanging in the closet.


1050
0:47:15,1 --> 0:47:16,55
And it startled him.


1051
0:47:16,55 --> 0:47:22,607
So he pulled it out and
started dancing with it.


1052
0:47:22,607 --> 0:47:24,44
DONNA MITROFF: That was
a creative solution.


1053
0:47:24,44 --> 0:47:25,5
[LAUGHTER]


1054
0:47:25,5 --> 0:47:27,26
DAVID NEWELL: But
that was an outtake


1055
0:47:27,26 --> 0:47:29,73
that we never let
out of our hands.


1056
0:47:29,73 --> 0:47:31,17
But you now know about it.


1057
0:47:31,17 --> 0:47:37,25
But the point I'm saying is
that he had a sense of humor.


1058
0:47:37,25 --> 0:47:39,67
And it goes back
to feelings, too.


1059
0:47:39,67 --> 0:47:42,39
He wasn't mad and stomped
out and said, OK, you're


1060
0:47:42,39 --> 0:47:43,67
all suspended.


1061
0:47:43,67 --> 0:47:47,13
That didn't work with Fred.


1062
0:47:47,13 --> 0:47:48,38
AUDIENCE: Just a comment.


1063
0:47:48,38 --> 0:47:51,1
There's been a lot of
attention in the media


1064
0:47:51,1 --> 0:47:54,27
lately about women taking
on management positions


1065
0:47:54,27 --> 0:47:57,1
and doing very well,
exercising more,


1066
0:47:57,1 --> 0:47:59,92
kind of, masculine management
type characteristics.


1067
0:47:59,92 --> 0:48:1,49
But the thing that
I love about Fred,


1068
0:48:1,49 --> 0:48:3,281
and especially looking
back because I never


1069
0:48:3,281 --> 0:48:6,29
would have picked this up as a
child, but as an adult, is he


1070
0:48:6,29 --> 0:48:9,37
was one of the first men who
was comfortable exhibiting


1071
0:48:9,37 --> 0:48:11,1
more feminine characteristics.


1072
0:48:11,1 --> 0:48:13,43
As a man, being in
touch with feelings.


1073
0:48:13,43 --> 0:48:16,73
DONNA MITROFF: And he also
created Lady Elaine Fairchilde.


1074
0:48:16,73 --> 0:48:17,305
And she--


1075
0:48:17,305 --> 0:48:18,263
AUDIENCE: There you go.


1076
0:48:18,263 --> 0:48:21,5
DONNA MITROFF: --was
that futuristic woman,


1077
0:48:21,5 --> 0:48:23,21
who wasn't afraid to stand up.


1078
0:48:23,21 --> 0:48:25,74
There are other
stories in our book


1079
0:48:25,74 --> 0:48:29,39
where she was the one
who stood up to the CEO


1080
0:48:29,39 --> 0:48:32,64
and said, don't ask me to do
something if you don't tell me


1081
0:48:32,64 --> 0:48:33,85
why I'm going to do it.


1082
0:48:33,85 --> 0:48:37,14
I mean that's pretty
masculine but that was--


1083
0:48:37,14 --> 0:48:39,19
IAN MITROFF: Suzanne,
I have to talk


1084
0:48:39,19 --> 0:48:42,7
about, you raised something
that's really important.


1085
0:48:42,7 --> 0:48:46,61
One of the things about
Fred, which is sad,


1086
0:48:46,61 --> 0:48:49,13
is that many men
are uncomfortable.


1087
0:48:49,13 --> 0:48:51,33
So you have all
these urban legends


1088
0:48:51,33 --> 0:48:54,34
that underneath he was
tattooed, and he was a seal,


1089
0:48:54,34 --> 0:48:56,83
and all that kind of
stuff because the reason


1090
0:48:56,83 --> 0:49:2,48
is you couldn't take that there
would be a man who would openly


1091
0:49:2,48 --> 0:49:5,28
talk about feelings, and
wouldn't be a effeminate--


1092
0:49:5,28 --> 0:49:8,9
or whatever the derogatory
term of the day-- and we


1093
0:49:8,9 --> 0:49:9,75
know all that kind of stuff.


1094
0:49:9,75 --> 0:49:16,3
So they had to project onto Fred
their fears and anxiety to make


1095
0:49:16,3 --> 0:49:18,71
him into something
that he wasn't.


1096
0:49:18,71 --> 0:49:21,1
He was masculine.


1097
0:49:21,1 --> 0:49:25,12
But I mean if you talk about,
if you go to Jung, where


1098
0:49:25,12 --> 0:49:28,54
you have both the feminine
and the masculine archetypes.


1099
0:49:28,54 --> 0:49:30,75
They are in every one of
us, but they're not always


1100
0:49:30,75 --> 0:49:31,69
equally developed.


1101
0:49:31,69 --> 0:49:34,43
And we're not always equally
comfortable in displaying


1102
0:49:34,43 --> 0:49:35,51
both of them.


1103
0:49:35,51 --> 0:49:39,27
That's another thing that
when you look at the story.


1104
0:49:39,27 --> 0:49:44,27
The story was the whole feeling,
was the whole the persona,


1105
0:49:44,27 --> 0:49:46,69
of Fred himself.


1106
0:49:46,69 --> 0:49:49,854
DONNA MITROFF: I think
we need to wrap it up.


1107
0:49:49,854 --> 0:49:52,55
We wanted to share with
you we have a website,


1108
0:49:52,55 --> 0:49:53,92
you can learn more about it.


1109
0:49:53,92 --> 0:49:58,546
And also the next one
has our email addresses.


1110
0:49:58,546 --> 0:50:0,9
IAN MITROFF: We also want
to thank our publicist


1111
0:50:0,9 --> 0:50:4,72
Rina Neiman, who helped
us put this together.


1112
0:50:4,72 --> 0:50:7,65
And our uh--


1113
0:50:7,65 --> 0:50:10,72
DONNA MITROFF: So you're
invited to be in touch with us


1114
0:50:10,72 --> 0:50:11,27
by email.


1115
0:50:11,27 --> 0:50:13,9



1116
0:50:13,9 --> 0:50:17,5
Nina has put together
the Twitter page for us.


1117
0:50:17,5 --> 0:50:20,6
Are you familiar
with this picture?


1118
0:50:20,6 --> 0:50:24,44
Of my, this picture is
just-- That's what happens.


1119
0:50:24,44 --> 0:50:27,73
And now it's happening to David.


1120
0:50:27,73 --> 0:50:31,54
People who can't touch
Fred, will come up to David


1121
0:50:31,54 --> 0:50:33,96
and just grab this
face because they


1122
0:50:33,96 --> 0:50:35,684
want they want to get close.


1123
0:50:35,684 --> 0:50:37,85
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you
so much Ian, Donna, David.


1124
0:50:37,85 --> 0:50:39,82
David will be over
there in the green booth


1125
0:50:39,82 --> 0:50:42,147
to sign autographs
for his pictures.


1126
0:50:42,147 --> 0:50:43,23
Thank you guys for coming.


1127
0:50:43,23 --> 0:52:43,23
[APPLAUSE]
