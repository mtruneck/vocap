In association with Post Carbon Institute


3
0:0:23,2 --> 0:0:47,7
There's No Tomorrow


4
0:0:47,7 --> 0:0:49,5
This is the earth,


5
0:0:49,5 --> 0:0:51,34
as it looked 90 million years ago.


6
0:0:51,34 --> 0:0:55,8
Geologists call this period the 'Late Cretaceous'.


7
0:0:55,8 --> 0:0:58,5
It was a time of extreme global warming,


8
0:0:58,5 --> 0:1:1,1
When dinosaurs still ruled the planet.


9
0:1:1,1 --> 0:1:2,79
They went about their lives,


10
0:1:2,79 --> 0:1:7,5
secure in their place at the top of the food chain,


11
0:1:7,5 --> 0:1:11,0
oblivious of the changes taking place around them.


12
0:1:11,0 --> 0:1:12,35
The continents were drifting apart,


13
0:1:12,35 --> 0:1:15,7
opening huge rifts in the Earth's crust.


14
0:1:15,7 --> 0:1:20,3
They flooded, becoming seas.


15
0:1:20,3 --> 0:1:22,38
Algae thrived in the extreme heat,


16
0:1:22,38 --> 0:1:25,2
poisoning the water.


17
0:1:25,2 --> 0:1:26,5
They died,


18
0:1:26,5 --> 0:1:32,2
and fell, in their trillions, to the bottom of the rifts.


19
0:1:32,2 --> 0:1:34,5
Rivers washed sediment into the seas,


20
0:1:34,5 --> 0:1:38,5
until the organic remains of the algae were buried.


21
0:1:38,5 --> 0:1:41,2
As the pressure grew, so did the heat,


22
0:1:41,2 --> 0:1:43,42
until a chemical reaction transformed the organics


23
0:1:43,42 --> 0:1:46,2
into hydrocarbon fossil fuels:


24
0:1:46,2 --> 0:1:49,1
Oil and Natural Gas.


25
0:1:49,1 --> 0:1:51,64
A similar process occurred on land,


26
0:1:51,64 --> 0:1:55,2
which produced coal.


27
0:1:55,2 --> 0:1:57,4
It took nature about 5 million years


28
0:1:57,4 --> 0:2:2,5
to create the fossil fuels that the world consumes in 1 year.


29
0:2:2,5 --> 0:2:3,4
The modern way of life


30
0:2:3,4 --> 0:2:6,5
is dependent on this fossilised sunlight,


31
0:2:6,5 --> 0:2:13,8
although a surprising number of people take it for granted.


32
0:2:13,8 --> 0:2:18,9
Since 1860, geologists have discovered over 2 trillion barrels of oil.


33
0:2:18,9 --> 0:2:26,0
Since then, the world has used approximately half.


34
0:2:26,0 --> 0:2:30,0
Before you can pump oil, you have to discover it.


35
0:2:30,0 --> 0:2:33,6
At first it was easy to find, and cheap to extract.


36
0:2:33,6 --> 0:2:36,9
The first great American oilfield was Spindletop,


37
0:2:36,9 --> 0:2:39,3
discovered in 1900


38
0:2:39,3 --> 0:2:41,3
Many more followed.


39
0:2:41,3 --> 0:2:43,5
Geologists scoured America.


40
0:2:43,5 --> 0:2:48,4
They found enormous deposits of oil, natural gas and coal.


41
0:2:48,4 --> 0:2:51,44
America produced more oil than any other country,


42
0:2:51,44 --> 0:2:56,1
enabling it to become an industrial super-power.


43
0:2:56,1 --> 0:2:57,98
Once an oil well starts producing oil,


44
0:2:57,98 --> 0:3:2,3
it's only a matter of time before it enters a decline.


45
0:3:2,3 --> 0:3:5,61
Individual wells have different production rates.


46
0:3:5,61 --> 0:3:7,19
When many wells are averaged together,


47
0:3:7,19 --> 0:3:9,52
the combined graph looks like a bell curve.


48
0:3:9,52 --> 0:3:11,37
Typically


49
0:3:11,37 --> 0:3:14,41
it takes 40 years after the peak of discovery


50
0:3:14,41 --> 0:3:17,32
for a country to reach its peak of production,


51
0:3:17,32 --> 0:3:20,94
after which it enters a permanent fall.


52
0:3:20,94 --> 0:3:22,57
In the 1950s,


53
0:3:22,57 --> 0:3:25,38
Shell geophysicist M. King Hubbert


54
0:3:25,38 --> 0:3:28,81
predicted that America's oil production would peak in 1970,


55
0:3:28,81 --> 0:3:33,5
40 years after the peak of U.S. oil discovery.


56
0:3:33,5 --> 0:3:35,4
Few believed him.


57
0:3:35,4 --> 0:3:37,6
However, in 1970,


58
0:3:37,6 --> 0:3:39,6
American oil production peaked,


59
0:3:39,6 --> 0:3:42,5
and entered a permanent decline.


60
0:3:42,5 --> 0:3:45,19
Hubbert was vindicated.


61
0:3:45,19 --> 0:3:46,15
From this point on,


62
0:3:46,15 --> 0:3:50,5
America would depend increasingly on imported oil.


63
0:3:50,5 --> 0:3:53,38
This made her vulnerable to supply disruptions,


64
0:3:53,38 --> 0:3:57,9
and contributed to the economic mayhem of the 1973


65
0:3:57,9 --> 0:4:1,9
and 1979 oil shocks.


66
0:4:1,9 --> 0:4:6,19
The 1930s saw the highest rate of oil discoveries in U.S. history.


67
0:4:6,19 --> 0:4:7,95
In spite of advanced technology,


68
0:4:7,95 --> 0:4:14,7
the decline in the discovery of new American oilfields has been relentless.


69
0:4:14,7 --> 0:4:17,6
More recent finds, such as ANWAR,


70
0:4:17,6 --> 0:4:22,5
would at best provide enough oil for 17 months.


71
0:4:22,5 --> 0:4:25,21
Even the new "Jack 2" field in the gulf of Mexico


72
0:4:25,21 --> 0:4:29,2
would only supply a few months of domestic demand.


73
0:4:29,2 --> 0:4:31,76
Though large, neither field comes close to satisfying


74
0:4:31,76 --> 0:4:36,3
America's energy requirements.


75
0:4:36,3 --> 0:4:37,1
Evidence is now mounting


76
0:4:37,1 --> 0:4:41,9
that world oil production is peaking, or is close to it.


77
0:4:41,9 --> 0:4:46,89
Globally, the rate of discovery of new oilfields peaked in the 1960s.


78
0:4:46,89 --> 0:4:47,81
Over 40 years later,


79
0:4:47,81 --> 0:4:50,0
the decline in the discovery of new fields


80
0:4:50,0 --> 0:4:54,1
seems unstoppable.


81
0:4:54,1 --> 0:4:56,5
54 of the 65 major oil producing nations


82
0:4:56,5 --> 0:5:1,5
have already peaked in production.


83
0:5:1,5 --> 0:5:6,9
Many of the others are expected to follow in the near future.


84
0:5:6,9 --> 0:5:7,8
The world will need to bring the equivalent


85
0:5:7,8 --> 0:5:10,14
of a new Saudi Arabia into production


86
0:5:10,14 --> 0:5:10,94
every three years


87
0:5:10,94 --> 0:5:15,89
to make up for declining output in existing oilfields.


88
0:5:15,89 --> 0:5:16,65
In the nineteen sixties,


89
0:5:16,65 --> 0:5:21,1
six barrels of oil were found for every one that was used.


90
0:5:21,1 --> 0:5:22,22
Four decades later,


91
0:5:22,22 --> 0:5:25,55
the world consumes between three and six barrels of oil


92
0:5:25,55 --> 0:5:29,2
for every one that it finds.


93
0:5:29,2 --> 0:5:31,3
Once the peak of world oil production is reached,


94
0:5:31,3 --> 0:5:33,88
demand for oil will outstrip supply,


95
0:5:33,88 --> 0:5:36,27
and the price of gasoline will fluctuate wildly,


96
0:5:36,27 --> 0:5:41,8
affecting far more than the cost of filling a car.


97
0:5:41,8 --> 0:5:44,19
Modern cities are fossil fuel dependent.


98
0:5:44,19 --> 0:5:46,35
Even roads are made from asphalt,


99
0:5:46,35 --> 0:5:47,94
a petroleum product,


100
0:5:47,94 --> 0:5:51,9
as are the roofs of many homes.


101
0:5:51,9 --> 0:5:53,13
Large areas would be uninhabitable


102
0:5:53,13 --> 0:5:58,9
without heating in the winter or air conditioning in the summer.


103
0:5:58,9 --> 0:6:0,93
Suburban sprawl encourages people to drive many miles


104
0:6:0,93 --> 0:6:4,3
to work, school and stores.


105
0:6:4,3 --> 0:6:6,45
Major cities have been zoned with residential


106
0:6:6,45 --> 0:6:8,73
and commercial areas placed far apart,


107
0:6:8,73 --> 0:6:11,6
forcing people to drive.


108
0:6:11,6 --> 0:6:12,86
Suburbia, and many communities


109
0:6:12,86 --> 0:6:19,5
were designed on the assumption of plentiful oil and energy.


110
0:6:19,5 --> 0:6:21,48
Chemicals derived from fossil fuels,


111
0:6:21,48 --> 0:6:23,24
or Petro-chemicals,


112
0:6:23,24 --> 0:6:28,4
are essential in the manufacture of countless products.


113
0:6:28,4 --> 0:6:30,1
The modern system of agriculture


114
0:6:30,1 --> 0:6:32,44
is heavily dependent on fossil fuels,


115
0:6:32,44 --> 0:6:33,64
as are hospitals,


116
0:6:33,64 --> 0:6:34,94
aviation,


117
0:6:34,94 --> 0:6:37,0
water distribution systems,


118
0:6:37,0 --> 0:6:38,22
and the U.S. military,


119
0:6:38,22 --> 0:6:44,0
which alone uses about 140 million barrels of oil a year.


120
0:6:44,0 --> 0:6:48,5
Fossil fuels are also essential for the creation of plastics and polymers,


121
0:6:48,5 --> 0:6:54,2
key ingredients in computers, entertainment devices and clothing.


122
0:6:54,2 --> 0:6:56,94
The global economy currently depends on endless growth,


123
0:6:56,94 --> 0:7:1,3
demanding an increasing supply of cheap energy.


124
0:7:1,3 --> 0:7:4,1
We are so dependant on oil and other fossil fuels,


125
0:7:4,1 --> 0:7:7,15
that even a small disruption in supply


126
0:7:7,15 --> 0:7:17,7
may have far-reaching effects on every aspect of our lives.


127
0:7:17,7 --> 0:7:22,89
ENERGY


128
0:7:22,89 --> 0:7:26,2
Energy is the ability to do work.


129
0:7:26,2 --> 0:7:36,0
The average American today has available the energy equivalent of 150 slaves, working 24 hours a day.


130
0:7:36,0 --> 0:7:39,9
Materials that store this energy for work are called fuels,


131
0:7:39,9 --> 0:7:42,0
Some fuels contain more energy than others.


132
0:7:42,0 --> 0:7:46,4
This is called energy density.


133
0:7:46,4 --> 0:7:50,0
Of these fuels, oil is the most critical.


134
0:7:50,0 --> 0:7:51,52
The world consumes 30 billion barrels a year,


135
0:7:51,52 --> 0:7:54,9
equal to 1 cubic mile of oil,


136
0:7:54,9 --> 0:7:56,4
which contains as much energy


137
0:7:56,4 --> 0:7:58,86
as would be generated from 52 nuclear power plants


138
0:7:58,86 --> 0:8:3,0
working for the next 50 years.


139
0:8:3,0 --> 0:8:7,57
Although oil only generates 1.6% of U.S. electricity,


140
0:8:7,57 --> 0:8:12,3
it powers 96% of all transportation.


141
0:8:12,3 --> 0:8:16,39
In 2008, two thirds of America's oil was imported.


142
0:8:16,39 --> 0:8:17,89
Most was from Canada,


143
0:8:17,89 --> 0:8:19,6
Mexico,


144
0:8:19,6 --> 0:8:21,29
Saudi Arabia,


145
0:8:21,29 --> 0:8:22,73
Venezuela,


146
0:8:22,73 --> 0:8:27,5
Nigeria, Iraq and Angola.


147
0:8:27,5 --> 0:8:29,36
Several factors make oil unique:


148
0:8:29,36 --> 0:8:33,2
it is energy dense.


149
0:8:33,2 --> 0:8:34,9
One barrel of oil contains the energy equivalent


150
0:8:34,9 --> 0:8:38,5
of almost three years of human labour.


151
0:8:38,5 --> 0:8:39,7
It is liquid at room temperature,


152
0:8:39,7 --> 0:8:41,84
easy to transport


153
0:8:41,84 --> 0:8:45,7
and usable in small engines.


154
0:8:45,7 --> 0:8:49,0
To acquire energy, you have to use energy.


155
0:8:49,0 --> 0:8:53,2
The trick is to use smaller amounts to find and extract larger amounts.


156
0:8:53,2 --> 0:8:55,62
This is called EROEI:


157
0:8:55,62 --> 0:9:1,5
Energy Return on Energy Invested.


158
0:9:1,5 --> 0:9:4,0
Conventional oil is a good example.


159
0:9:4,0 --> 0:9:8,89
The easy to extract, high-quality crude was pumped first.


160
0:9:8,89 --> 0:9:15,3
Oilmen spent the energy equivalent of 1 barrel of oil to find and extract 100.


161
0:9:15,3 --> 0:9:19,8
The EROEI of oil was 100.


162
0:9:19,8 --> 0:9:21,1
As the easy to find oil was pumped first,


163
0:9:21,1 --> 0:9:23,95
exploration moved into deep waters,


164
0:9:23,95 --> 0:9:25,73
or distant countries,


165
0:9:25,73 --> 0:9:29,9
using increasing amounts of energy to do so.


166
0:9:29,9 --> 0:9:32,0
Often, the oil we find now is heavy or sour crude,


167
0:9:32,0 --> 0:9:35,89
and is expensive to refine.


168
0:9:35,89 --> 0:9:40,3
The EROEI for oil today is as low as 10.


169
0:9:40,3 --> 0:9:43,83
If you use more energy to get the fuel than is contained in the fuel,


170
0:9:43,83 --> 0:9:50,0
it's not worth the effort to get it.


171
0:9:50,0 --> 0:9:53,5
It is possible to convert one fuel source into another.


172
0:9:53,5 --> 0:9:54,2
Every time you do so,


173
0:9:54,2 --> 0:9:59,2
some of the energy contained in the original fuel is lost.


174
0:9:59,2 --> 0:10:0,95
For instance, there is unconventional oil:


175
0:10:0,95 --> 0:10:4,2
Tar Sands and Shale.


176
0:10:4,2 --> 0:10:7,0
Tar Sands are found mainly in Canada.


177
0:10:7,0 --> 0:10:11,9
Two thirds of the world's shale is in the US.


178
0:10:11,9 --> 0:10:13,61
Both of these fuels can be converted to synthetic crude oil.


179
0:10:13,61 --> 0:10:17,1
However, this requires large amounts of heat and fresh water,


180
0:10:17,1 --> 0:10:18,9
reducing their EROEI,


181
0:10:18,9 --> 0:10:24,5
which varies from five, to as low as one and a half.


182
0:10:24,5 --> 0:10:26,2
Shale is an exceptionally poor fuel,


183
0:10:26,2 --> 0:10:29,15
pound for pound containing about one third the energy


184
0:10:29,15 --> 0:10:33,3
of a box of breakfast cereal.


185
0:10:33,3 --> 0:10:34,7
Coal exists in vast quantities,


186
0:10:34,7 --> 0:10:39,0
and generates almost half of the planet's electricity.


187
0:10:39,0 --> 0:10:41,5
The world uses almost 2 cubic miles of coal a year.


188
0:10:41,5 --> 0:10:48,8
However, Global coal production may peak before 2040.


189
0:10:48,8 --> 0:10:50,75
The claim that America has centuries worth of coal is deceptive,


190
0:10:50,75 --> 0:10:56,5
as it fails to account for growing demand, and decreasing quality.


191
0:10:56,5 --> 0:10:58,66
Much of the high quality anthracite coal is gone,


192
0:10:58,66 --> 0:11:4,5
leaving lower quality coal that is less energy dense.


193
0:11:4,5 --> 0:11:6,7
Production issues arise, as surface coal is depleted,


194
0:11:6,7 --> 0:11:11,1
and miners have to dig deeper and in less accessible areas.


195
0:11:11,1 --> 0:11:14,3
Many use destructive mountaintop removal to reach coal deposits,


196
0:11:14,3 --> 0:11:20,1
causing environmental mayhem.


197
0:11:20,1 --> 0:11:24,0
Natural gas is often found alongside oil and coal.


198
0:11:24,0 --> 0:11:27,4
North American discovery of conventional gas peaked in the 1950s,


199
0:11:27,4 --> 0:11:31,2
and production peaked in the early 70s.


200
0:11:31,2 --> 0:11:34,12
If the discovery graph is moved forward by 23 years,


201
0:11:34,12 --> 0:11:38,6
the possible future of North American conventional natural gas production


202
0:11:38,6 --> 0:11:41,4
is revealed.


203
0:11:41,4 --> 0:11:44,79
Recent breakthroughs have allowed the extraction of unconventional natural gas,


204
0:11:44,79 --> 0:11:51,4
such as shale gas, which might help offset decline in the years ahead.


205
0:11:51,4 --> 0:11:54,2
Unconventional natural gas is controversial,


206
0:11:54,2 --> 0:11:58,6
as it needs high energy prices to be profitable.


207
0:11:58,6 --> 0:11:59,75
Even with Unconventional gas,


208
0:11:59,75 --> 0:12:7,89
there may be a peak in global natural gas production by 2030.


209
0:12:7,89 --> 0:12:12,2
Large uranium reserves for nuclear fission still exist.


210
0:12:12,2 --> 0:12:15,83
To replace the 10 terawatts the world currently generates from fossil fuels,


211
0:12:15,83 --> 0:12:19,25
would require 10,000 nuclear power plants.


212
0:12:19,25 --> 0:12:25,0
At that rate, the known reserves of uranium would last for only 10 to 20 years.


213
0:12:25,0 --> 0:12:29,8
Experiments with plutonium based fast-breeder reactors


214
0:12:29,8 --> 0:12:31,1
in France and Japan


215
0:12:31,1 --> 0:12:33,68
have been expensive failures.


216
0:12:33,68 --> 0:12:39,2
Nuclear fusion faces massive technical obstacles.


217
0:12:39,2 --> 0:12:40,3
Then there are the renewables.


218
0:12:40,3 --> 0:12:45,6
Windpower has a high EROEI, but is intermittent.


219
0:12:45,6 --> 0:12:47,4
Hydro power is reliable,


220
0:12:47,4 --> 0:12:52,3
but most rivers in the developed world are already dammed.


221
0:12:52,3 --> 0:12:54,0
Conventional geothermal power plants


222
0:12:54,0 --> 0:12:57,0
use existing hotspots near the Earth's surface.


223
0:12:57,0 --> 0:13:1,2
They are limited to those areas.


224
0:13:1,2 --> 0:13:2,75
In the experimental EGS system,


225
0:13:2,75 --> 0:13:6,4
two shafts would be drilled 6 miles deep.


226
0:13:6,4 --> 0:13:9,16
Water is pumped down one shaft, to be heated in fissures,


227
0:13:9,16 --> 0:13:13,9
then rise up the other, generating power.


228
0:13:13,9 --> 0:13:15,3
According to a recent MIT report,


229
0:13:15,3 --> 0:13:22,9
this technology might supply 10% of US electricity by 2050.


230
0:13:22,9 --> 0:13:25,33
Wave power is restricted to coastal areas.


231
0:13:25,33 --> 0:13:31,1
The energy density of waves varies from region to region.


232
0:13:31,1 --> 0:13:35,9
Transporting wave-generated electricity inland would be challenging.


233
0:13:35,9 --> 0:13:41,0
Also, the salty ocean environment is corrosive to turbines.


234
0:13:41,0 --> 0:13:43,9
Biofuels are fuels that are grown.


235
0:13:43,9 --> 0:13:46,44
Wood has a low energy density, and grows slowly.


236
0:13:46,44 --> 0:13:51,43
The world uses 3.7 cubic miles of wood a year.


237
0:13:51,43 --> 0:13:52,91
Biodiesel and ethanol


238
0:13:52,91 --> 0:13:57,5
are made from crops grown by petroleum powered agriculture.


239
0:13:57,5 --> 0:14:2,0
The energy profit from these fuels is very low.


240
0:14:2,0 --> 0:14:5,9
Some politicians want to turn corn into ethanol.


241
0:14:5,9 --> 0:14:10,2
Using Ethanol to supply one tenth of projected US oil use in 2020,


242
0:14:10,2 --> 0:14:15,1
would require 3% of America's Land.


243
0:14:15,1 --> 0:14:20,3
To supply one third would require 3 times the area now used to grow food.


244
0:14:20,3 --> 0:14:23,33
To supply all US petroleum consumption in 2020


245
0:14:23,33 --> 0:14:28,86
would take twice as much land as is used to grow food.


246
0:14:28,86 --> 0:14:33,5
Hydrogen has to be extracted from Natural Gas, coal or water,


247
0:14:33,5 --> 0:14:36,91
which uses more energy than we get from the Hydrogen.


248
0:14:36,91 --> 0:14:42,5
This makes a Hydrogen economy unlikely.


249
0:14:42,5 --> 0:14:45,62
All the world's photovoltaic solar panels generate as much electricity


250
0:14:45,62 --> 0:14:48,79
as two coal power plants.


251
0:14:48,79 --> 0:14:51,0
The equivalent of between 1 and 4 tons of coal


252
0:14:51,0 --> 0:14:56,1
are used in the manufacture of a single solar panel.


253
0:14:56,1 --> 0:15:0,0
We'd have to cover as many as 140,000 square miles with panels


254
0:15:0,0 --> 0:15:2,29
to meet current world demand.


255
0:15:2,29 --> 0:15:8,6
As of 2007, there are only about 4 square miles.


256
0:15:8,6 --> 0:15:12,4
Concentrated Solar Power, or Solar Thermal has great potential,


257
0:15:12,4 --> 0:15:17,89
though at the moment there are only a small number of plants operating.


258
0:15:17,89 --> 0:15:19,29
They are also limited to sunny climates,


259
0:15:19,29 --> 0:15:21,5
requiring large amounts of electricity


260
0:15:21,5 --> 0:15:26,5
to be transmitted over long distances.


261
0:15:26,5 --> 0:15:29,45
All of the alternatives to oil depend on oil-powered machinery,


262
0:15:29,45 --> 0:15:36,3
or require materials such as plastics that are produced from oil.


263
0:15:36,3 --> 0:15:38,89
When considering future claims of amazing new fuels or inventions,


264
0:15:38,89 --> 0:15:40,8
ask:


265
0:15:40,8 --> 0:15:45,0
Does the advocate have a working, commercial model of the invention?


266
0:15:45,0 --> 0:15:47,5
What is its energy density?


267
0:15:47,5 --> 0:15:51,0
Can it be stored or easily distributed?


268
0:15:51,0 --> 0:15:53,8
Is it reliable or intermittent?


269
0:15:53,8 --> 0:15:56,29
Can it be scaled to a national level?


270
0:15:56,29 --> 0:15:59,79
Are there hidden engineering challenges?


271
0:15:59,79 --> 0:16:2,9
What is the EROEI?


272
0:16:2,9 --> 0:16:4,9
What are the environmental impacts?


273
0:16:4,9 --> 0:16:8,4
Remember that large numbers can be deceptive.


274
0:16:8,4 --> 0:16:9,9
For example: 1 billion barrels of oil


275
0:16:9,9 --> 0:16:15,5
will satisfy global demand for only 12 days.


276
0:16:15,5 --> 0:16:19,7
A transition from fossil fuels would be a monumental challenge.


277
0:16:19,7 --> 0:16:24,41
As of 2007, coal generates 48.5% of U.S. electricity.


278
0:16:24,41 --> 0:16:27,28
21.6% is from natural gas,


279
0:16:27,28 --> 0:16:30,21
1.6% is from petroleum,


280
0:16:30,21 --> 0:16:32,67
19.4% is from nuclear,


281
0:16:32,67 --> 0:16:35,8
5.8% is from hydro.


282
0:16:35,8 --> 0:16:40,3
Other renewables only generate 2.5%.


283
0:16:40,3 --> 0:16:43,12
Is it possible to replace a system based on fossil fuels


284
0:16:43,12 --> 0:16:46,39
with a patchwork of alternatives?


285
0:16:46,39 --> 0:16:48,89
Major technological advances are needed,


286
0:16:48,89 --> 0:16:51,89
as well as political will and co-operation,


287
0:16:51,89 --> 0:16:53,54
massive investment,


288
0:16:53,54 --> 0:16:56,4
international consensus,


289
0:16:56,4 --> 0:16:59,3
the retrofitting of the $45 trillion global economy,


290
0:16:59,3 --> 0:17:2,2
including transportation,


291
0:17:2,2 --> 0:17:3,0
manufacturing industries,


292
0:17:3,0 --> 0:17:5,8
and agricultural systems,


293
0:17:5,8 --> 0:17:10,0
as well as officials competent to manage the transition.


294
0:17:10,0 --> 0:17:11,52
If all these are achieved,


295
0:17:11,52 --> 0:17:19,0
could the current way of life continue?


296
0:17:19,0 --> 0:17:21,0
Growth


297
0:17:21,0 --> 0:17:24,0
These bacteria live in a bottle.


298
0:17:24,0 --> 0:17:27,0
Their population doubles every minute.


299
0:17:27,0 --> 0:17:30,8
At 11AM there is one bacterium.


300
0:17:30,8 --> 0:17:33,8
At 12 noon the bottle is full.


301
0:17:33,8 --> 0:17:35,29
It is half-full at 11.59


302
0:17:35,29 --> 0:17:38,9
leaving only enough space for one more doubling.


303
0:17:38,9 --> 0:17:41,3
The bacteria see the danger.


304
0:17:41,3 --> 0:17:44,5
They search for new bottles, and find 3.


305
0:17:44,5 --> 0:17:47,8
They assume that their problem is solved.


306
0:17:47,8 --> 0:17:50,0
By 12 noon, the first bottle is full.


307
0:17:50,0 --> 0:17:54,0
By 12.01, the second bottle is full.


308
0:17:54,0 --> 0:17:57,9
By 12.02, all the bottles are full.


309
0:17:57,9 --> 0:17:59,92
This is the problem that we face,


310
0:17:59,92 --> 0:18:6,6
due to the doubling caused by Exponential Growth.


311
0:18:6,6 --> 0:18:9,27
When humanity began to use coal and oil as fuel sources,


312
0:18:9,27 --> 0:18:14,2
it experienced unprecedented growth.


313
0:18:14,2 --> 0:18:18,59
Even low growth rates produce large increases over time.


314
0:18:18,59 --> 0:18:20,15
At a 1% growth rate,


315
0:18:20,15 --> 0:18:23,5
an economy will double in 70 years.


316
0:18:23,5 --> 0:18:27,8
A 2% rate doubles in 35 years.


317
0:18:27,8 --> 0:18:29,26
At a 10% growth rate,


318
0:18:29,26 --> 0:18:33,4
an economy will double in only 7 years.


319
0:18:33,4 --> 0:18:36,75
If an economy grows at the current average of 3%,


320
0:18:36,75 --> 0:18:40,59
it doubles every 23 years.


321
0:18:40,59 --> 0:18:44,2
With each doubling, demand for energy and resources


322
0:18:44,2 --> 0:18:48,7
will exceed all the previous doublings combined.


323
0:18:48,7 --> 0:18:52,4
The financial system is built on the assumption of growth


324
0:18:52,4 --> 0:18:56,7
- which requires an increasing supply of energy to support it.


325
0:18:56,7 --> 0:18:58,46
Banks lend money they don't have,


326
0:18:58,46 --> 0:19:1,0
in effect creating it.


327
0:19:1,0 --> 0:19:4,81
The borrowers use the newly created loan money to grow their businesses,


328
0:19:4,81 --> 0:19:6,2
and pay back the debt,


329
0:19:6,2 --> 0:19:10,5
with an interest payment which requires more growth.


330
0:19:10,5 --> 0:19:13,1
Due to this creation of debt formed money,


331
0:19:13,1 --> 0:19:19,5
most of the world's money represents a debt with interest to be paid.


332
0:19:19,5 --> 0:19:22,1
Without continual new and ever larger generations


333
0:19:22,1 --> 0:19:24,5
of borrowers to produce growth,


334
0:19:24,5 --> 0:19:25,87
and thus pay off these debts,


335
0:19:25,87 --> 0:19:30,0
the world economy will collapse.


336
0:19:30,0 --> 0:19:31,14
Like a Ponzi Scheme,


337
0:19:31,14 --> 0:19:35,5
the system must expand or die.


338
0:19:35,5 --> 0:19:37,5
Partly through this debt system,


339
0:19:37,5 --> 0:19:40,79
the effects of economic growth have been spectacular:


340
0:19:40,79 --> 0:19:41,6
in GDP,


341
0:19:41,6 --> 0:19:43,11
damming of rivers,


342
0:19:43,11 --> 0:19:44,18
water use,


343
0:19:44,18 --> 0:19:46,45
fertiliser consumption,


344
0:19:46,45 --> 0:19:47,76
urban population,


345
0:19:47,76 --> 0:19:49,66
paper consumption,


346
0:19:49,66 --> 0:19:51,1
motor vehicles,


347
0:19:51,1 --> 0:19:52,41
communications


348
0:19:52,41 --> 0:19:55,6
and tourism.


349
0:19:55,6 --> 0:19:57,45
World population has grown to 7 billion,


350
0:19:57,45 --> 0:20:2,4
and is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050.


351
0:20:2,4 --> 0:20:6,29
On a flat, infinite earth, this would not be a problem.


352
0:20:6,29 --> 0:20:8,68
However, as the Earth is round and finite,


353
0:20:8,68 --> 0:20:13,8
we will eventually face limits to growth.


354
0:20:13,8 --> 0:20:14,3
Economic expansion


355
0:20:14,3 --> 0:20:18,3
has resulted in increases in atmospheric nitrous oxide


356
0:20:18,3 --> 0:20:19,1
and methane,


357
0:20:19,1 --> 0:20:20,86
ozone depletion,


358
0:20:20,86 --> 0:20:22,83
increases in great floods,


359
0:20:22,83 --> 0:20:25,87
damage to ocean ecosystems,


360
0:20:25,87 --> 0:20:27,7
including nitrogen runoff,


361
0:20:27,7 --> 0:20:30,75
loss of rainforest and woodland,


362
0:20:30,75 --> 0:20:33,1
increases in domesticated land,


363
0:20:33,1 --> 0:20:38,5
and species exinctions.


364
0:20:38,5 --> 0:20:40,2
If we place a single grain of rice


365
0:20:40,2 --> 0:20:42,6
on the first square of a chessboard,


366
0:20:42,6 --> 0:20:46,1
double this and place 2 grains on the second,


367
0:20:46,1 --> 0:20:49,9
double again and place 4 on the third,


368
0:20:49,9 --> 0:20:51,5
double again and place 8 on the fourth,


369
0:20:51,5 --> 0:20:52,65
and continue this way,


370
0:20:52,65 --> 0:20:55,47
putting on each square twice the number of grains


371
0:20:55,47 --> 0:20:57,1
than were on the previous one,


372
0:20:57,1 --> 0:20:59,0
by the time we reach the final square,


373
0:20:59,0 --> 0:21:3,79
we need an astronomical number of grains:


374
0:21:3,79 --> 0:21:5,21
9 quintillion,


375
0:21:5,21 --> 0:21:7,43
223 quadrillion,


376
0:21:7,43 --> 0:21:9,28
372 trillion,


377
0:21:9,28 --> 0:21:11,27
36 billion,


378
0:21:11,27 --> 0:21:13,5
854 million,


379
0:21:13,5 --> 0:21:17,4
776 thousand grains:


380
0:21:17,4 --> 0:21:18,56
more grain than the human race


381
0:21:18,56 --> 0:21:22,9
has grown in the last 10,000 years.


382
0:21:22,9 --> 0:21:23,7
Modern economies,


383
0:21:23,7 --> 0:21:25,4
like the grains on the chess board,


384
0:21:25,4 --> 0:21:27,7
doubles every few decades.


385
0:21:27,7 --> 0:21:33,8
On which square of the chessboard are we?


386
0:21:33,8 --> 0:21:34,75
Besides energy,


387
0:21:34,75 --> 0:21:37,95
civilisation demands numerous essential resources:


388
0:21:37,95 --> 0:21:39,25
fresh water,


389
0:21:39,25 --> 0:21:40,48
topsoil,


390
0:21:40,48 --> 0:21:41,31
food,


391
0:21:41,31 --> 0:21:42,12
forests,


392
0:21:42,12 --> 0:21:45,8
and many kinds of minerals and metals.


393
0:21:45,8 --> 0:21:46,15
Growth is limited


394
0:21:46,15 --> 0:21:51,4
by the essential resource in scarcest supply.


395
0:21:51,4 --> 0:21:52,31
A barrel is made of staves,


396
0:21:52,31 --> 0:21:54,97
and like water filling a barrel,


397
0:21:54,97 --> 0:21:57,79
growth can go no further than the lowest stave,


398
0:21:57,79 --> 0:22:2,29
or the most limited essential resource.


399
0:22:2,29 --> 0:22:3,83
Humans currently utilise


400
0:22:3,83 --> 0:22:8,2
40% of all photosynthesis n Earth.


401
0:22:8,2 --> 0:22:9,73
Though it might be possible to use 80%,


402
0:22:9,73 --> 0:22:23,24
we are unlikely to ever use 160%.


403
0:22:23,24 --> 0:22:27,0
FOOD


404
0:22:27,0 --> 0:22:28,18
The global food supply


405
0:22:28,18 --> 0:22:32,3
relies heavily on fossil fuels.


406
0:22:32,3 --> 0:22:33,14
Before WW1,


407
0:22:33,14 --> 0:22:36,3
all agriculture was Organic.


408
0:22:36,3 --> 0:22:39,8
Following the invention of fossil fuel derived fertilisers and pesticides


409
0:22:39,8 --> 0:22:42,59
there were massive improvements in food production,


410
0:22:42,59 --> 0:22:48,9
allowing for increases in human population.


411
0:22:48,9 --> 0:22:49,39
The use of artificial fertilisers


412
0:22:49,39 --> 0:22:51,6
has fed far more people than would have been possible


413
0:22:51,6 --> 0:22:56,4
with organic agriculture alone.


414
0:22:56,4 --> 0:22:58,35
Fossil fuels are needed for farming equipment,


415
0:22:58,35 --> 0:22:59,75
transportation,


416
0:22:59,75 --> 0:23:1,6
refrigeration,


417
0:23:1,6 --> 0:23:2,55
packaging - in plastic,


418
0:23:2,55 --> 0:23:5,0
and cooking.


419
0:23:5,0 --> 0:23:8,87
Modern agriculture uses land to turn fossil fuels into food


420
0:23:8,87 --> 0:23:12,0
- and food into people.


421
0:23:12,0 --> 0:23:13,92
About 7 calories of fossil-fuel energy


422
0:23:13,92 --> 0:23:19,29
are used to produce 1 calorie of food.


423
0:23:19,29 --> 0:23:30,8
In America, food travels approximately 1,500 miles from farm to customer.


424
0:23:30,8 --> 0:23:31,52
Besides fossil fuel decline,


425
0:23:31,52 --> 0:23:35,2
there are several threats to the current system of food production:


426
0:23:35,2 --> 0:23:36,33
Cheap energy,


427
0:23:36,33 --> 0:23:37,92
improved technology


428
0:23:37,92 --> 0:23:43,9
and subsidies have allowed massive fish catches.


429
0:23:43,9 --> 0:23:45,7
Global fish catches peaked in the late nineteen eighties,


430
0:23:45,7 --> 0:23:53,8
forcing fishermen to move into deep waters.


431
0:23:53,8 --> 0:23:55,71
Nitrogen run off by fossil fuel based fertilisers


432
0:23:55,71 --> 0:24:0,5
poisons rivers and seas, creating enormous dead zones.


433
0:24:0,5 --> 0:24:1,3
At this rate,


434
0:24:1,3 --> 0:24:3,97
all fish populations are projected to collapse


435
0:24:3,97 --> 0:24:7,9
by 2048.


436
0:24:7,9 --> 0:24:11,31
Acid rain from cities and industries leeches the soil of vital nutrients,


437
0:24:11,31 --> 0:24:12,35
such as potassium,


438
0:24:12,35 --> 0:24:13,21
calcium,


439
0:24:13,21 --> 0:24:18,2
and magnesium.


440
0:24:18,2 --> 0:24:20,2
Another threat is a lack of water.


441
0:24:20,2 --> 0:24:26,4
Many farms use water pumped from underground aquifers for irrigation.


442
0:24:26,4 --> 0:24:28,89
The aquifers need thousands of years to fill up,


443
0:24:28,89 --> 0:24:30,77
but can be pumped dry in a few decades,


444
0:24:30,77 --> 0:24:34,2
like oil wells.


445
0:24:34,2 --> 0:24:36,91
America's massive Ogallala aquifer has fallen so low


446
0:24:36,91 --> 0:24:42,5
that many farmers have had to return to less productive dry-land farming.


447
0:24:42,5 --> 0:24:47,0
Additionally, The use of irrigation and fertilisers can lead to salinisation:


448
0:24:47,0 --> 0:24:49,29
the accumulation of salt in the soil.


449
0:24:49,29 --> 0:24:53,7
This is a major cause of desertification.


450
0:24:53,7 --> 0:24:56,5
Still another threat is topsoil loss.


451
0:24:56,5 --> 0:24:57,65
200 years ago,


452
0:24:57,65 --> 0:25:1,9
there were 6 feet of topsoil on the American prairies.


453
0:25:1,9 --> 0:25:3,33
Today, through tillage and poor practices,


454
0:25:3,33 --> 0:25:8,79
approximately half is gone.


455
0:25:8,79 --> 0:25:13,27
Irrigation encourages the growth of stem rust fungi like UG-99


456
0:25:13,27 --> 0:25:19,0
- which has the potential to destroy 80% of the world's grain harvest.


457
0:25:19,0 --> 0:25:20,8
According to Norman Borlaug,


458
0:25:20,8 --> 0:25:22,29
father of the Green Revolution,


459
0:25:22,29 --> 0:25:29,7
stem rust "has immense potential for social and human destruction."


460
0:25:29,7 --> 0:25:32,0
The use of biofuels means that less land


461
0:25:32,0 --> 0:25:37,5
will be available for food production.


462
0:25:37,5 --> 0:25:40,0
An area has a finite carrying capacity.


463
0:25:40,0 --> 0:25:41,64
This is the number of animals or people


464
0:25:41,64 --> 0:25:44,8
that can live there indefinitely.


465
0:25:44,8 --> 0:25:47,49
If a species overshoots the carrying capacity of that area,


466
0:25:47,49 --> 0:25:53,2
it will die back until the population returns to its natural limits.


467
0:25:53,2 --> 0:25:54,16
The world has avoided this die-off


468
0:25:54,16 --> 0:25:56,4
by finding new lands to cultivate,


469
0:25:56,4 --> 0:25:57,87
or by increasing production,


470
0:25:57,87 --> 0:26:1,0
which has been possible largely thanks to oil.


471
0:26:1,0 --> 0:26:3,63
To continue growth,


472
0:26:3,63 --> 0:26:7,9
more resources are required than the Earth can provide,


473
0:26:7,9 --> 0:26:11,7
but no new planets are available.


474
0:26:11,7 --> 0:26:13,29
In the face of all these challenges,


475
0:26:13,29 --> 0:26:16,3
global food production must double by 2050


476
0:26:16,3 --> 0:26:21,4
to feed the growing world population.


477
0:26:21,4 --> 0:26:24,2
1 billion people are already malnourished or starving.


478
0:26:24,2 --> 0:26:28,9
There will be challenges in feeding over 9 billion in the years to come,


479
0:26:28,9 --> 0:26:41,5
when world oil and natural gas production will be in decline.


480
0:26:41,5 --> 0:26:45,98
HAPPY ENDING


481
0:26:45,98 --> 0:26:48,1
The global economy grows exponentially,


482
0:26:48,1 --> 0:26:50,5
at about 3% a year,


483
0:26:50,5 --> 0:26:53,26
consuming increasing amounts of non-renewable fuels,


484
0:26:53,26 --> 0:26:54,9
minerals and metals,


485
0:26:54,9 --> 0:26:56,84
as well as renewable resources


486
0:26:56,84 --> 0:27:0,27
like water, forests, soils and fish


487
0:27:0,27 --> 0:27:3,9
faster than they can be replenished.


488
0:27:3,9 --> 0:27:5,57
Even at a growth rate of 1%,


489
0:27:5,57 --> 0:27:10,1
an economy will double in 70 years.


490
0:27:10,1 --> 0:27:13,5
The problem is intensified by other factors:


491
0:27:13,5 --> 0:27:15,5
Globalisation allows people on one continent


492
0:27:15,5 --> 0:27:19,9
to buy goods and food made by those on another.


493
0:27:19,9 --> 0:27:20,75
The lines of supply are long,


494
0:27:20,75 --> 0:27:26,5
placing strains on a limited oil resource.


495
0:27:26,5 --> 0:27:30,7
We now rely on distant countries for basic necessities.


496
0:27:30,7 --> 0:27:34,3
Modern cities are fossil fuel dependent.


497
0:27:34,3 --> 0:27:36,65
Most Banking Systems are based on debt,


498
0:27:36,65 --> 0:27:40,2
forcing people into a spiral of loans and repayments


499
0:27:40,2 --> 0:27:43,9
- producing growth.


500
0:27:43,9 --> 0:27:47,2
What can be done in the face of these problems?


501
0:27:47,2 --> 0:27:48,59
Many believe that the crisis can be prevented


502
0:27:48,59 --> 0:27:50,25
through conservation,


503
0:27:50,25 --> 0:27:51,7
technology,


504
0:27:51,7 --> 0:27:52,56
smart growth,


505
0:27:52,56 --> 0:27:53,8
recycling,


506
0:27:53,8 --> 0:27:55,1
electric cars and hybrids,


507
0:27:55,1 --> 0:27:57,6
substitution,


508
0:27:57,6 --> 0:28:0,9
or voting.


509
0:28:0,9 --> 0:28:1,37
Conservation will save you money,


510
0:28:1,37 --> 0:28:5,0
but it alone won't save the planet.


511
0:28:5,0 --> 0:28:7,29
If some people cut back on oil use,


512
0:28:7,29 --> 0:28:9,9
the reduced demand will drive down the price,


513
0:28:9,9 --> 0:28:13,0
allowing others to buy it for less.


514
0:28:13,0 --> 0:28:13,58
In the same fashion,


515
0:28:13,58 --> 0:28:17,4
a more efficient engine that uses less energy will,


516
0:28:17,4 --> 0:28:21,9
paradoxically, lead to greater energy use.


517
0:28:21,9 --> 0:28:22,89
In the 19th century,


518
0:28:22,89 --> 0:28:25,53
English economist William Stanley Jevons


519
0:28:25,53 --> 0:28:28,1
realised that Better steam engines made coal


520
0:28:28,1 --> 0:28:31,0
a more cost effective fuel source,


521
0:28:31,0 --> 0:28:32,79
which led to the use of more steam engines,


522
0:28:32,79 --> 0:28:37,8
which increased total coal consumption.


523
0:28:37,8 --> 0:28:40,2
Growth of use will consume any energy or resources


524
0:28:40,2 --> 0:28:48,2
saved through conservation.


525
0:28:48,2 --> 0:28:48,7
Many believe that scientists


526
0:28:48,7 --> 0:28:52,5
will solve these problems with new technology.


527
0:28:52,5 --> 0:28:56,4
However, technology is not energy.


528
0:28:56,4 --> 0:28:57,9
Technology can channel energy into work,


529
0:28:57,9 --> 0:29:0,29
but it can't replace it.


530
0:29:0,29 --> 0:29:2,39
It also consumes resources:


531
0:29:2,39 --> 0:29:3,4
for instance;


532
0:29:3,4 --> 0:29:4,75
computers are made with one tenth


533
0:29:4,75 --> 0:29:8,87
of the energy needed to make a car.


534
0:29:8,87 --> 0:29:10,25
More advanced technologies


535
0:29:10,25 --> 0:29:12,15
may make the situation worse,


536
0:29:12,15 --> 0:29:14,43
as many require rare minerals,


537
0:29:14,43 --> 0:29:17,5
which are also approaching limits.


538
0:29:17,5 --> 0:29:17,83
For example,


539
0:29:17,83 --> 0:29:21,72
97% of the world's Rare Earths are produced by China,


540
0:29:21,72 --> 0:29:26,5
most from a single mine in inner Mongolia.


541
0:29:26,5 --> 0:29:28,83
These minerals are used in catalytic converters,


542
0:29:28,83 --> 0:29:30,54
aircraft engines,


543
0:29:30,54 --> 0:29:33,25
high efficiency magnets and hard drives,


544
0:29:33,25 --> 0:29:35,15
hybrid car batteries,


545
0:29:35,15 --> 0:29:36,35
lasers,


546
0:29:36,35 --> 0:29:37,58
portable X-Rays,


547
0:29:37,58 --> 0:29:39,8
shielding for nuclear reactors,


548
0:29:39,8 --> 0:29:41,7
compact discs,


549
0:29:41,7 --> 0:29:43,55
hybrid vehicle motors,


550
0:29:43,55 --> 0:29:45,31
low energy light-bulbs,


551
0:29:45,31 --> 0:29:46,56
fibre optics


552
0:29:46,56 --> 0:29:49,8
and flat-screen displays.


553
0:29:49,8 --> 0:29:52,54
China has begun to consider restricting the export of these minerals,


554
0:29:52,54 --> 0:29:57,8
as demand soars.


555
0:29:57,8 --> 0:30:0,75
So called sustainable growth or smart growth won't help,


556
0:30:0,75 --> 0:30:3,7
as it also uses non renewable metals and minerals


557
0:30:3,7 --> 0:30:5,37
in ever increasing quantities,


558
0:30:5,37 --> 0:30:8,9
including Rare Earths.


559
0:30:8,9 --> 0:30:10,5
Recycling will not solve the problem,


560
0:30:10,5 --> 0:30:11,58
as it requires energy,


561
0:30:11,58 --> 0:30:16,0
and the process is not 100% efficient.


562
0:30:16,0 --> 0:30:19,81
It is only possible to reclaim a fraction of the material being recycled;


563
0:30:19,81 --> 0:30:25,5
a large portion is lost forever as waste.


564
0:30:25,5 --> 0:30:28,5
Electric cars run on electricity.


565
0:30:28,5 --> 0:30:30,55
As most power is generated from fossil fuels,


566
0:30:30,55 --> 0:30:33,9
this is not a solution.


567
0:30:33,9 --> 0:30:37,26
Also, cars of all types consume oil in their production.


568
0:30:37,26 --> 0:30:43,3
Each tire alone requires about 7 gallons of Petroleum.


569
0:30:43,3 --> 0:30:47,4
There are around 800 million cars in the world, as of 2010.


570
0:30:47,4 --> 0:30:49,4
At current growth rates,


571
0:30:49,4 --> 0:30:53,9
this number would reach 2 billion by 2025.


572
0:30:53,9 --> 0:30:57,2
It is unlikely that the planet can support this many vehicles for long,


573
0:30:57,2 --> 0:31:1,3
regardless of their power source.


574
0:31:1,3 --> 0:31:2,68
Many economists believe


575
0:31:2,68 --> 0:31:5,32
that the free market will substitute one energy source


576
0:31:5,32 --> 0:31:8,9
with another through technological innovation.


577
0:31:8,9 --> 0:31:10,2
However, the main substitutes to oil


578
0:31:10,2 --> 0:31:13,9
face their own decline rates.


579
0:31:13,9 --> 0:31:20,0
Substitution also fails to account for the time needed to prepare for a transition.


580
0:31:20,0 --> 0:31:21,83
The U.S. Department of Energy's Hirsch report


581
0:31:21,83 --> 0:31:25,35
estimates that at least 2 decades would be needed to prepare


582
0:31:25,35 --> 0:31:28,9
for the effects of Peak Oil.


583
0:31:28,9 --> 0:31:31,17
The issues of energy shortages,


584
0:31:31,17 --> 0:31:33,6
resource depletion,


585
0:31:33,6 --> 0:31:34,75
topsoil loss,


586
0:31:34,75 --> 0:31:40,5
and pollution are all symptoms of a single, larger problem:


587
0:31:40,5 --> 0:31:43,7
Growth.


588
0:31:43,7 --> 0:31:46,33
As long as our financial system demands endless growth,


589
0:31:46,33 --> 0:31:49,92
reform is unlikely to succeed.


590
0:31:49,92 --> 0:31:54,3
What then, will the future look like?


591
0:31:54,3 --> 0:31:56,37
Optimists believe that growth will continue forever,


592
0:31:56,37 --> 0:31:59,4
without limits.


593
0:31:59,4 --> 0:32:2,12
Pessimists think that we're heading towards a new Stone Age,


594
0:32:2,12 --> 0:32:5,3
or extinction.


595
0:32:5,3 --> 0:32:7,41
The truth may lie between these extremes.


596
0:32:7,41 --> 0:32:12,9
It is possible that society might fall back to a simpler state,


597
0:32:12,9 --> 0:32:16,2
one in which energy use is a lot less.


598
0:32:16,2 --> 0:32:18,9
This would mean a harder life for most.


599
0:32:18,9 --> 0:32:18,7
More manual labour,


600
0:32:18,7 --> 0:32:20,41
more farm work,


601
0:32:20,41 --> 0:32:25,7
and local production of goods, food and services.


602
0:32:25,7 --> 0:32:29,8
What should a person do to prepare for such a possible future?


603
0:32:29,8 --> 0:32:34,1
Expect a decrease in supplies of food and goods from far away places.


604
0:32:34,1 --> 0:32:36,5
Start walking or cycling.


605
0:32:36,5 --> 0:32:40,2
Get used to using less electricity.


606
0:32:40,2 --> 0:32:41,9
Get out of debt.


607
0:32:41,9 --> 0:32:43,4
Try to avoid banks.


608
0:32:43,4 --> 0:32:45,3
Instead of shopping at big box stores,


609
0:32:45,3 --> 0:32:48,15
support local businesses.


610
0:32:48,15 --> 0:32:51,6
Buy food grown locally, at Farmers' Markets.


611
0:32:51,6 --> 0:32:55,45
Instead of a lawn, consider gardening to grow your own food.


612
0:32:55,45 --> 0:32:58,4
Learn how to preserve it.


613
0:32:58,4 --> 0:33:0,0
Consider the use of local currencies


614
0:33:0,0 --> 0:33:2,5
should the larger economy cease to function,


615
0:33:2,5 --> 0:33:7,1
and develop greater self sufficiency.


616
0:33:7,1 --> 0:33:8,5
None of these steps will prevent Collapse,


617
0:33:8,5 --> 0:33:13,9
but they might improve your chances in a low energy future,


618
0:33:13,9 --> 0:33:15,41
one in which we will have to be more self reliant,


619
0:33:15,41 --> 0:35:15,41
as our ancestors once were.
