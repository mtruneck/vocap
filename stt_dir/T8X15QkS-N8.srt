2
0:0:37,327 --> 0:0:39,647
Smoking makes you dead.


3
0:0:39,647 --> 0:0:43,767
It means you get all black inside
and swell up like a whale,


4
0:0:43,767 --> 0:0:45,647
and explode in hospital.


5
0:0:45,647 --> 0:0:48,407
Daddy says criminals
and bad people smoke.


6
0:0:48,407 --> 0:0:51,287
Timmy? He's not bothering you, is he?


7
0:0:51,287 --> 0:0:54,47
Not at all, no,
but no ice cream in the shop.


8
0:0:54,47 --> 0:1:0,47
- I don't have an ice cream.
- I think Timmy's telling a naughty fib.


9
0:1:0,47 --> 0:1:3,807
For goodness' sake. Outside, now!


10
0:1:3,807 --> 0:1:5,847
No books for you.


11
0:1:5,847 --> 0:1:8,327
- I'm so sorry.
- Not at all.


12
0:1:8,327 --> 0:1:11,687
"'My, what a lovely carrot,'
said the hippo.


13
0:1:11,687 --> 0:1:16,207
'Yes, but is it organic?'
Said the fussy rabbit in a squeaky voice."


14
0:1:16,207 --> 0:1:23,87
Oh, sorry. (Squeaky voice) "'Yes,
but is it organic? ' said the..."


15
0:1:23,87 --> 0:1:25,727
- Bernard. Bernard!
- What?


16
0:1:25,727 --> 0:1:29,687
It's hot in the worm. Can I have a break?


17
0:1:29,687 --> 0:1:33,207
You'd shatter the magic
for the lovely children,


18
0:1:33,207 --> 0:1:35,967
so no, certainly not.


19
0:1:35,967 --> 0:1:38,647
"'No, it's not organic,' said the hippo.


20
0:1:38,647 --> 0:1:42,367
'Oh, I don't want it then,'
said the fussy rabbit." Ow.


21
0:1:42,367 --> 0:1:47,47
Ow! Look, it's a real beard, I told you!


22
0:1:47,47 --> 0:1:50,767
I'm finished.
They're picking me up for the hen night.


23
0:1:50,767 --> 0:1:54,607
A big, old house in the country.
It'll be brilliant.


24
0:1:54,607 --> 0:1:58,327
I doubt it, since your night begins
with the word "hen", prefix of doom...


25
0:1:58,327 --> 0:2:2,327
It'll be great -
all the old school gang back together.


26
0:2:2,327 --> 0:2:5,727
- I thought you hated school?
- I never said that.


27
0:2:5,727 --> 0:2:9,647
I just look at your life now
and work backwards.


28
0:2:9,647 --> 0:2:12,567
- Bernard.
- You haven't finished, worm!


29
0:2:12,567 --> 0:2:14,807
What happened to the rabbit?


30
0:2:14,807 --> 0:2:18,247
He... starved to death. The end.


31
0:2:18,247 --> 0:2:21,687
Look, I could write
a better kids' book than this.


32
0:2:21,687 --> 0:2:26,967
Pretty pictures, simple story, something
for the little tykes to really enjoy.


33
0:2:26,967 --> 0:2:31,567
See the film, collect the stickers,
play the Xbox game, eat the yoghurt.


34
0:2:31,567 --> 0:2:34,887
It'll be my gift
to children-kind everywhere.


35
0:2:34,887 --> 0:2:38,47
Everyone thinks they could write one.
It's not that easy.


36
0:2:38,47 --> 0:2:40,47
It is. They go for any old rubbish.


37
0:2:40,47 --> 0:2:45,527
- Children are actually very discerning.
- They're not, they lap up any old gumph.


38
0:2:45,527 --> 0:2:50,247
Not gumph! Let's write a children's
classic. You and me, together!


39
0:2:50,247 --> 0:2:54,567
- You two could never do it.
- We could! Before you even get back.


40
0:2:54,567 --> 0:2:58,367
OK. By tomorrow. A million
billion pounds says you have nothing.


41
0:2:58,367 --> 0:3:1,887
Oh, the old million billion.
Make it interesting - say 50?


42
0:3:1,887 --> 0:3:3,207
OK.


43
0:3:3,207 --> 0:3:12,687
And another 50 says you have
an appalling, excruciating night.


44
0:3:12,687 --> 0:3:17,207
Oh, Fran, you forgot your bag!


45
0:3:17,207 --> 0:3:21,767
(Grunts)


46
0:3:21,767 --> 0:3:24,447
(Fran) Look, there it is
(Woman) Oh, fantastic!


47
0:3:24,447 --> 0:3:26,487
(Fran) Let's make a huge dinner.


48
0:3:26,487 --> 0:3:29,687
(Woman) No, don't let me eat!
Chain me to the radiator.


49
0:3:29,687 --> 0:3:35,767
(Fran) Oh, yeah, yeah! Come on! Oh!


50
0:3:35,767 --> 0:3:41,167
- Now... booze.
- Oh, yes.


51
0:3:41,167 --> 0:3:47,47
Oh. Is that enough?


52
0:3:47,47 --> 0:3:49,327
Oh, great, we've got loads!


53
0:3:49,327 --> 0:3:57,727
(Continues unloading bottles)


54
0:3:57,727 --> 0:4:2,607
Did you bring anything else, Dr Death?


55
0:4:2,607 --> 0:4:6,47
- Just this.
- Oh, my God. Life Cry.


56
0:4:6,47 --> 0:4:9,207
I haven't seen that
since our school reunion.


57
0:4:9,207 --> 0:4:12,607
(Sighs) You always know
you're in for a good night


58
0:4:12,607 --> 0:4:22,367
when there's a polar bear
bleeding on the label.


59
0:4:22,367 --> 0:4:27,807
Manny, we haven't written anything!
You're not pulling your weight.


60
0:4:27,807 --> 0:4:33,287
Manny? Agree with me
when I'm talking to you!


61
0:4:33,287 --> 0:4:36,487
Manny?


62
0:4:36,487 --> 0:4:41,567
- Manny?
- (Thud)


63
0:4:41,567 --> 0:4:45,647
- Manny?
- Hello?


64
0:4:45,647 --> 0:4:47,687
Back in the worm.


65
0:4:47,687 --> 0:4:50,247
- I don't want to.
- Back in the worm!


66
0:4:50,247 --> 0:4:54,367
I've been ready to write for ages,
I've been waiting for you.


67
0:4:54,367 --> 0:4:57,527
- Well, I've been waiting for you.
- I'm ready.


68
0:4:57,527 --> 0:5:0,527
Well, I'm ready.


69
0:5:0,527 --> 0:5:7,687
Let's start then. Come on.


70
0:5:7,687 --> 0:5:31,487
(Clears throat)


71
0:5:31,487 --> 0:5:35,767
- We should do some research!
- So we know what we're up against!


72
0:5:35,767 --> 0:5:37,807
Yeah.


73
0:5:37,807 --> 0:5:41,967
Here we go.


74
0:5:41,967 --> 0:5:44,7
(Manny) Hmm.


75
0:5:44,7 --> 0:5:48,47
- Hmph! Ha!
- (Laughs) Look at...


76
0:5:48,47 --> 0:5:51,367
I hadn't realised
the competition was this bad.


77
0:5:51,367 --> 0:5:56,887
This is drivel.
Ball, duck, umbrella. On and on it goes.


78
0:5:56,887 --> 0:5:58,887
With no hint of plot.


79
0:5:58,887 --> 0:6:3,127
Precisely. Now we know
just how easy it's gonna be.


80
0:6:3,127 --> 0:6:5,287
Yeah.


81
0:6:5,287 --> 0:6:7,487
All right, then. Get that...


82
0:6:7,487 --> 0:6:24,607
Ha! Right.


83
0:6:24,607 --> 0:6:28,87
- We have to think about children.
- Absolutely!


84
0:6:28,87 --> 0:6:32,887
- Let us consider the modern child.
- Yes.


85
0:6:32,887 --> 0:6:36,407
What do they want in a book?


86
0:6:36,407 --> 0:6:38,487
Who cares?


87
0:6:38,487 --> 0:6:41,687
We have to write for ourselves
as children.


88
0:6:41,687 --> 0:6:46,567
You know, when innocence was legal.
When summers seemed to go on forever.


89
0:6:46,567 --> 0:6:51,167
A-A-And you'd cycle miles
just to tell a friend you'd seen a frog.


90
0:6:51,167 --> 0:6:55,567
(Chuckles) When you could play
in your back yard with any old thing.


91
0:6:55,567 --> 0:6:59,807
All I needed was a... was a breeze block.


92
0:6:59,807 --> 0:7:3,807
And... and a bit of an old bone.


93
0:7:3,807 --> 0:7:6,247
I bet you could make whole worlds?


94
0:7:6,247 --> 0:7:11,767
Oh, I could! One minute I'd be laying
siege to a castle with a bit of an old bone


95
0:7:11,767 --> 0:7:15,727
and the next minute
I'd be setting sail on a Spanish galleon


96
0:7:15,727 --> 0:7:18,887
towards a breeze block.


97
0:7:18,887 --> 0:7:22,367
- Mm. Come on, let's start.
- Yes.


98
0:7:22,367 --> 0:7:26,47
Right. Here we go.


99
0:7:26,47 --> 0:7:36,527
Ah. Right...


100
0:7:36,527 --> 0:7:41,527
I'm so happy for you
and your lovely fiancé.


101
0:7:41,527 --> 0:7:44,207
- (Whispers) Mark...
- (AIl) Ahh...


102
0:7:44,207 --> 0:7:48,287
Now, speeches.


103
0:7:48,287 --> 0:7:51,87
Now, Becky... I love you.


104
0:7:51,87 --> 0:7:54,447
- (AIl) Ahh...
- Don't interrupt!


105
0:7:54,447 --> 0:7:57,647
Look, we have known each other
for a long time.


106
0:7:57,647 --> 0:7:59,847
- (Belches)
- But what's time?


107
0:7:59,847 --> 0:8:2,687
There's no such thing, there's only love.


108
0:8:2,687 --> 0:8:6,247
- Ahh...
- Don't interrupt!


109
0:8:6,247 --> 0:8:10,247
I love you, all the time.


110
0:8:10,247 --> 0:8:12,287
I would like to say...


111
0:8:12,287 --> 0:8:17,127
No, brides don't say. Right...


112
0:8:17,127 --> 0:8:23,847
- Eat cake.
- Ahh.


113
0:8:23,847 --> 0:8:26,87
(Cheering)


114
0:8:26,87 --> 0:8:30,167
- (# Bananarama: Venus)
- Barmanararmba!


115
0:8:30,167 --> 0:8:34,7
# Burning like a silver flame


116
0:8:34,7 --> 0:8:37,767
# The summit of beauty and love


117
0:8:37,767 --> 0:8:42,7
# And Venus was her name... #


118
0:8:42,7 --> 0:8:46,167
(Sighs) Manny Bianco, nul points. My go.


119
0:8:46,167 --> 0:8:49,487
(Phone)


120
0:8:49,487 --> 0:8:52,447
- Hello.
- Wah-hey!


121
0:8:52,447 --> 0:8:54,167
Oh, hello.


122
0:8:54,167 --> 0:8:59,927
Just thought you'd want to hear the
sound of four girls having the best time.


123
0:8:59,927 --> 0:9:2,487
(Cheering)


124
0:9:2,487 --> 0:9:5,927
Yeah, yeah,
I bet you're crying on the inside.


125
0:9:5,927 --> 0:9:10,767
- How's the book coming?
- Brilliant. Very well.


126
0:9:10,767 --> 0:9:15,207
- Fran, come and dance!
- I'm just listening to Bernard lying!


127
0:9:15,207 --> 0:9:21,807
And remember, £100, and I want cash,
not forged book tokens this time.


128
0:9:21,807 --> 0:9:24,127
Becky! Tell me you're happy.


129
0:9:24,127 --> 0:9:26,807
I'm so happy,
and any more would be bad.


130
0:9:26,807 --> 0:9:30,607
Well, it gets better...
for now is the time...


131
0:9:30,607 --> 0:9:33,847
- for Life Cry.
- No, Fran, no more.


132
0:9:33,847 --> 0:9:36,487
But yes, and we shall play a game.


133
0:9:36,487 --> 0:9:38,927
- No, no games...
- Games!


134
0:9:38,927 --> 0:9:41,367
- (Music stops)
- Remember this?


135
0:9:41,367 --> 0:9:45,7
It's time for a nice game of... Truth.


136
0:9:45,7 --> 0:9:47,327
Oh, I hate that.


137
0:9:47,327 --> 0:9:50,687
Maybe you'll enjoy it more
after some more cake.


138
0:9:50,687 --> 0:9:57,527
- No, no more cake, please.
- Games! Cake! Booze! Truth!


139
0:9:57,527 --> 0:10:1,87
- We can't let her win. Come on, to work.
- Right.


140
0:10:1,87 --> 0:10:6,727
- OK. OK.
- Here we go. Er, book for...


141
0:10:6,727 --> 0:10:8,767
- Kids.
- Kids.


142
0:10:8,767 --> 0:10:13,47
All right, let's just, you know,
get some ideas bouncing around.


143
0:10:13,47 --> 0:10:16,327
- Go crazy, no rules...
- Anything goes.


144
0:10:16,327 --> 0:10:24,47
No, not anything goes! I said no rules!


145
0:10:24,47 --> 0:10:26,727
- Hit me, hit me.
- Right. Something...


146
0:10:26,727 --> 0:10:29,647
er... with a... a fox!


147
0:10:29,647 --> 0:10:32,607
No.


148
0:10:32,607 --> 0:10:34,647
Right. Er... Ah!


149
0:10:34,647 --> 0:10:38,7
What about a London pigeon?


150
0:10:38,7 --> 0:10:43,7
No, that's terrible,
that makes me cringe. No, no, no, no.


151
0:10:43,7 --> 0:10:47,327
Something, you know, something...
How about... how about...


152
0:10:47,327 --> 0:10:53,367
How about a mouse?
Now we're getting somewhere! A mouse.


153
0:10:53,367 --> 0:10:57,687
Now, who is this mouse?
Where is he from, where's he going?


154
0:10:57,687 --> 0:10:59,727
Where does he live?


155
0:10:59,727 --> 0:11:1,767
Er, he lives... he lives...


156
0:11:1,767 --> 0:11:4,887
This had better be good.
It better be perfect.


157
0:11:4,887 --> 0:11:11,127
He lives in a... bottle bank!


158
0:11:11,127 --> 0:11:13,407
Oh-ho! Brilliant! Fabulous!


159
0:11:13,407 --> 0:11:17,207
Er, and, er, he... he plays the trombone!


160
0:11:17,207 --> 0:11:19,247
Keep going.


161
0:11:19,247 --> 0:11:21,807
And, er, he only eats...


162
0:11:21,807 --> 0:11:26,127
- liquorice!
- Manny, this is solid gold. Solid gold!


163
0:11:26,127 --> 0:11:28,927
His... his best friend is a panda!


164
0:11:28,927 --> 0:11:33,367
No! No! No!


165
0:11:33,367 --> 0:11:35,727
Awful! Bilge!


166
0:11:35,727 --> 0:11:38,487
Child poison!
You stay away from the story.


167
0:11:38,487 --> 0:11:44,487
I'll deal with the plot. You can...
do pictures as I hand you the pages.


168
0:11:44,487 --> 0:11:47,567
Something bright and idiotic.


169
0:11:47,567 --> 0:11:55,247
And I will co-write this with myself.


170
0:11:55,247 --> 0:11:57,287
- Huh? Huh?
- Ah.


171
0:11:57,287 --> 0:11:59,807
Ah-ha-ha.


172
0:11:59,807 --> 0:12:2,287
Yah!


173
0:12:2,287 --> 0:12:5,207
Hah-hah. Huh?


174
0:12:5,207 --> 0:12:7,527
That's rubbish!


175
0:12:7,527 --> 0:12:20,407
Start again!


176
0:12:20,407 --> 0:12:22,447
So what do you think?


177
0:12:22,447 --> 0:12:25,487
It's, erm, it's brilliant.


178
0:12:25,487 --> 0:12:30,407
Er, it might be a little long
at a 1,030 pages.


179
0:12:30,407 --> 0:12:37,367
Well, we could lose about a page
and a half but the rest is totally essential.


180
0:12:37,367 --> 0:12:44,167
The plot's... interesting. Might be
a little complex for the three to sixes.


181
0:12:44,167 --> 0:12:46,207
It couldn't be simpler.


182
0:12:46,207 --> 0:12:50,47
There's the academic
who survived the Stalinist purges


183
0:12:50,47 --> 0:12:52,927
and is now having flashbacks
to that time.


184
0:12:52,927 --> 0:12:57,167
His daughter, whose long marriage
is collapsing around her,


185
0:12:57,167 --> 0:13:0,767
and the journalist who suspects
the academic was never in Russia,


186
0:13:0,767 --> 0:13:3,447
who falls obsessively in love
with the daughter


187
0:13:3,447 --> 0:13:6,967
and sacrifices his career
to become a lens grinder in Omsk.


188
0:13:6,967 --> 0:13:12,247
I mean... what's the problem? I don't think
we should talk down to children.


189
0:13:12,247 --> 0:13:17,687
It's... Bernard, it's brilliant. It is.
It's so good. I mean, I'm excited -


190
0:13:17,687 --> 0:13:22,567
I'm very excited about how excited
everybody will be when they see it.


191
0:13:22,567 --> 0:13:24,607
It is exciting.


192
0:13:24,607 --> 0:13:29,687
I just have two teeny-weeny
suggestions for changes.


193
0:13:29,687 --> 0:13:32,367
- Which are?
- Well...


194
0:13:32,367 --> 0:13:35,7
instead of... the, er,


195
0:13:35,7 --> 0:13:38,407
academic
and the journalist and the daughter,


196
0:13:38,407 --> 0:13:45,647
erm, perhaps it could be about...
an elephant?


197
0:13:45,647 --> 0:13:49,207
- An elephant?
- That's right.


198
0:13:49,207 --> 0:13:51,287
I see.


199
0:13:51,287 --> 0:13:53,527
What's your other suggestion?


200
0:13:53,527 --> 0:13:59,367
Well, instead of the Stalinist purges
and the divorce and the investigation,


201
0:13:59,367 --> 0:14:10,367
erm, it could be about... Iosing a balloon.


202
0:14:10,367 --> 0:14:13,887
An elephant who loses his balloon?


203
0:14:13,887 --> 0:14:17,727
That's it.


204
0:14:17,727 --> 0:14:19,767
(Mouths)


205
0:14:19,767 --> 0:14:22,767
- But still my story in essence?
- Oh, yes.


206
0:14:22,767 --> 0:14:26,687
- My vision.
- Completely.


207
0:14:26,687 --> 0:14:36,527
Yes, all right, let's do that then! Come on!


208
0:14:36,527 --> 0:14:38,767
Oh, look, it's me again.


209
0:14:38,767 --> 0:14:43,47
Here's one. Tanya,
I told Hugh Conti, remember,


210
0:14:43,47 --> 0:14:48,967
that you were the one
who gave him crabs.


211
0:14:48,967 --> 0:14:52,967
You wouldn't do that.


212
0:14:52,967 --> 0:15:0,127
- Why did you do that?
- He was really itchy!


213
0:15:0,127 --> 0:15:3,287
(Cackling)


214
0:15:3,287 --> 0:15:5,327
Who's next?


215
0:15:5,327 --> 0:15:8,7
I can't believe you kissed my dad.


216
0:15:8,7 --> 0:15:12,927
Why didn't you tell us you were the one
stealing clothes from college?


217
0:15:12,927 --> 0:15:15,567
- We were freaked out!
- I was young.


218
0:15:15,567 --> 0:15:21,967
- Have you still got my dress?
- No. I made it into toilet curtains.


219
0:15:21,967 --> 0:15:26,607
As we're playing Truth, Fran,
I think you're a bit jealous.


220
0:15:26,607 --> 0:15:30,647
That's why you got us pissed
and made us play your stupid game,


221
0:15:30,647 --> 0:15:34,7
- to bring us down to your level.
- Who am I jealous of?


222
0:15:34,7 --> 0:15:36,247
- I've got a career.
- (Scoffs)


223
0:15:36,247 --> 0:15:38,927
- I've got a job and a family.
- (Scoffs)


224
0:15:38,927 --> 0:15:41,927
- I'm getting married.
- (Scoffs)


225
0:15:41,927 --> 0:15:50,207
And you are still
the same old Auntie Millicent.


226
0:15:50,207 --> 0:15:52,247
Who... who's Auntie Millicent?


227
0:15:52,247 --> 0:15:54,807
It was what we used to call you,


228
0:15:54,807 --> 0:15:59,967
because we knew
you'd turn into a crazy spinster.


229
0:15:59,967 --> 0:16:4,647
And you have, hanging out with
your two freaks from the book shop.


230
0:16:4,647 --> 0:16:7,87
(Laughter)


231
0:16:7,87 --> 0:16:12,407
It was, wasn't it?! Oh, yes, Auntie
Millicent who lived in the crooked house.


232
0:16:12,407 --> 0:16:16,7
- With loads of cats.
- That's right - purple cats.


233
0:16:16,7 --> 0:16:23,807
- And you had sex with them all.
- (Laughing)


234
0:16:23,807 --> 0:16:28,647
At least I didn't have a threesome
with Mark after the school reunion.


235
0:16:28,647 --> 0:16:34,7
Oh, did I just say that?


236
0:16:34,7 --> 0:16:38,567
- Becky, we were going to tell you...
- Obviously we were going to tell you,


237
0:16:38,567 --> 0:16:40,607
just not like this.


238
0:16:40,607 --> 0:16:46,167
Do you know what, Fran? You could
have just kept your mouth shut.


239
0:16:46,167 --> 0:16:48,287
Exactly, Fran - least said...


240
0:16:48,287 --> 0:16:57,447
Shut up, Tanya!


241
0:16:57,447 --> 0:17:1,47
I was... waiting for the right time
to tell you, Becky.


242
0:17:1,47 --> 0:17:3,527
Like her anniversary or something?


243
0:17:3,527 --> 0:17:5,647
(# Bananarama: More More More)


244
0:17:5,647 --> 0:17:9,287
# Any time you want to
do what you gotta do... #


245
0:17:9,287 --> 0:17:11,487
Anyone for a nightcap?


246
0:17:11,487 --> 0:17:13,607
# How do you like it, how do you like it?


247
0:17:13,607 --> 0:17:22,47
# More more more,
how do you like it? #


248
0:17:22,47 --> 0:17:27,847
(Slurring) I'm going to read it again.


249
0:17:27,847 --> 0:17:33,327
There's the elephant,
he's happy with his balloon.


250
0:17:33,327 --> 0:17:39,927
Oh, no! It's gone!


251
0:17:39,927 --> 0:17:41,967
Where is it?


252
0:17:41,967 --> 0:17:48,287
It's not behind the rhino.


253
0:17:48,287 --> 0:17:50,807
Look in the alligator's mouth.


254
0:17:50,807 --> 0:17:55,447
(Both) It's not there either.


255
0:17:55,447 --> 0:17:59,647
Ohh... the monkey's got it in the tree!


256
0:17:59,647 --> 0:18:4,87
- He brings it back...
- (Both) They all drink lemonade.


257
0:18:4,87 --> 0:18:10,847
The end!


258
0:18:10,847 --> 0:18:14,567
- Here's to us.
- (Sighs)


259
0:18:14,567 --> 0:18:21,127
Bernard, I feel sorry for the children
who grew up before they could read this.


260
0:18:21,127 --> 0:18:25,87
Manny, we are going to be...
very very rich.


261
0:18:25,87 --> 0:18:27,287
How rich, Bernard?


262
0:18:27,287 --> 0:18:30,527
Oh, uncontrollably, incontinently rich.


263
0:18:30,527 --> 0:18:33,887
- And... and Fran will be humiliated.
- Yeah!


264
0:18:33,887 --> 0:18:39,367
See, we don't need
this dirty, filthy everyday money.


265
0:18:39,367 --> 0:18:41,687
Success will bring problems.


266
0:18:41,687 --> 0:18:46,87
I don't wanna wake up
in rehab with Shergar.


267
0:18:46,87 --> 0:18:50,967
What problems? We're on the pig's back,
charging through a velvet field.


268
0:18:50,967 --> 0:18:53,647
There will be pressure for a follow-up.


269
0:18:53,647 --> 0:18:58,727
People will say, "You are the elephant
balloon guys! Where's the next one?"


270
0:18:58,727 --> 0:19:2,807
Who cares? Who cares what
our disgusting public think?


271
0:19:2,807 --> 0:19:6,287
And all the houses -
you'll be in your Mustique house.


272
0:19:6,287 --> 0:19:9,767
You'll think,
"Where's my designer underpants?


273
0:19:9,767 --> 0:19:11,887
"Oh, in my Kong Hong house."


274
0:19:11,887 --> 0:19:15,727
- Oh, no!
- And there's the press intrusion.


275
0:19:15,727 --> 0:19:18,47
The press, will they be onto us?


276
0:19:18,47 --> 0:19:21,367
Bernard, they'll hound us
like a pack of... hounds!


277
0:19:21,367 --> 0:19:23,407
But I'm not doing anything.


278
0:19:23,407 --> 0:19:29,127
I'm just strolling up the beach with my
discreetly pregnant Brazilian girlfriend.


279
0:19:29,127 --> 0:19:33,47
And then the boat appears
with... laden with pappa-ritzy,


280
0:19:33,47 --> 0:19:36,47
- and I'll say, "You filth!"
- Filth!


281
0:19:36,47 --> 0:19:40,127
"Take a photo of me if you must,
but leave her out of it!


282
0:19:40,127 --> 0:19:47,647
"She didn't ask for any of this.
She's just an ordinary lingerie model."


283
0:19:47,647 --> 0:19:51,247
I can't deal with it.
I just wanna live in my normal mansion


284
0:19:51,247 --> 0:19:54,167
with my normal helicopter
and normal yacht.


285
0:19:54,167 --> 0:19:56,887
- Is that too much to ask?
- No!


286
0:19:56,887 --> 0:20:0,407
- Manny, we must undo this thing.
- What do you mean?


287
0:20:0,407 --> 0:20:3,487
- It has to go.
- Yeah, you're right, Bernard.


288
0:20:3,487 --> 0:20:15,807
It's our only chance
of living a normal life.


289
0:20:15,807 --> 0:20:24,247
- Ready?
- Yeah.


290
0:20:24,247 --> 0:20:26,327
This is the right thing to do.


291
0:20:26,327 --> 0:20:33,607
Yeah, Mustique's
probably quite nice but...


292
0:20:33,607 --> 0:21:23,167
- Get it!
- Oh!


293
0:21:23,167 --> 0:21:27,447
It was a big animal,
like a hippo or a whale.


294
0:21:27,447 --> 0:21:29,647
- I think it was a camel.
- Was it?


295
0:21:29,647 --> 0:21:33,727
- It had lost something.
- Yeah, a... wheelbarrow, er...


296
0:21:33,727 --> 0:21:36,967
chest of drawers, er, microlight, er...


297
0:21:36,967 --> 0:21:48,647
Oh, I don't know. It's not coming back.
It's never coming back!


298
0:21:48,647 --> 0:21:51,207
- Oh.
- You haven't written anything.


299
0:21:51,207 --> 0:21:54,207
Actually, we wrote
a very good children's book.


300
0:21:54,207 --> 0:21:59,527
We had to burn it
because it was too good.


301
0:21:59,527 --> 0:22:5,687
It happens all the time. £50, please.


302
0:22:5,687 --> 0:22:8,287
What sort of time did you have? Really.


303
0:22:8,287 --> 0:22:12,687
It... was... bliss!


304
0:22:12,687 --> 0:22:14,767
It was... it was so amazing.


305
0:22:14,767 --> 0:22:22,967
It couldn't have been better.
Best time in the world.


306
0:22:22,967 --> 0:22:26,607
Oh, there you go, it was awful.


307
0:22:26,607 --> 0:22:29,887
But, well, the wedding's off...


308
0:22:29,887 --> 0:22:33,607
So I don't have to buy a present.
I'm up on the weekend.


309
0:22:33,607 --> 0:22:35,647
Mister, how much is this?


310
0:22:35,647 --> 0:22:38,767
That's a first edition, that's expensive.


311
0:22:38,767 --> 0:22:42,407
I've saved all my pocket money
and I've got nine pounds.


312
0:22:42,407 --> 0:22:45,687
- Oh, well done, you.
- That is a lot of money.


313
0:22:45,687 --> 0:22:48,407
Yeah, but that's still £50 though.


314
0:22:48,407 --> 0:22:59,847
Oh, it's my favourite book ever.
I wish I had £50.


315
0:22:59,847 --> 0:23:2,7
Is it really your favourite book?


316
0:23:2,7 --> 0:23:7,207
I love it more than anything in the world.


317
0:23:7,207 --> 0:23:10,7
Well, you...


318
0:23:10,7 --> 0:23:13,47
I've never said this
to anybody before but...


319
0:23:13,47 --> 0:23:22,0
you're gonna have to get a job.


320
0:23:22,0 --> 0:25:22,0
