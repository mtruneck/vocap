1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:19,5



2
0:0:19,5 --> 0:0:20,89
DANNY BOWIEN: I'll be the first
to admit that I had no


3
0:0:20,89 --> 0:0:23,48
idea what I was getting myself
into when I started this.


4
0:0:23,48 --> 0:0:27,3
I mean, I'm Korean, and I'm
making Chinese food.


5
0:0:27,3 --> 0:0:28,192
Where's that big platter at?


6
0:0:28,192 --> 0:0:32,194
I never cooked Chinese food
until last year, so it's


7
0:0:32,194 --> 0:0:33,444
pretty crazy.


8
0:0:33,444 --> 0:0:50,62



9
0:0:50,62 --> 0:0:54,482
They raised the fucking price
of the two for Tuesday.


10
0:0:54,482 --> 0:0:56,82
It's $1.29 now, which
is fucking bullshit.


11
0:0:56,82 --> 0:1:0,19
My name's Danny Bowien,
and I'm the cook.


12
0:1:0,19 --> 0:1:4,76
Not the only cook, but a cook
at Mission Chinese Food.


13
0:1:4,76 --> 0:1:6,17
A cook's life is really hard.


14
0:1:6,17 --> 0:1:9,17
I mean, you basically do it
because you're passionate


15
0:1:9,17 --> 0:1:11,61
about something, not because
you want to make money.


16
0:1:11,61 --> 0:1:14,9
And so I was really tired of
working at these restaurants


17
0:1:14,9 --> 0:1:15,92
and making for people
I couldn't connect


18
0:1:15,92 --> 0:1:17,27
to in a lot of ways.


19
0:1:17,27 --> 0:1:19,56
And none of my friends could
come eat at the restaurant


20
0:1:19,56 --> 0:1:21,35
that I worked at, because they
either didn't want to or they


21
0:1:21,35 --> 0:1:21,63
couldn't afford it.


22
0:1:21,63 --> 0:1:23,908
I wanted to be able to make
food for people that I


23
0:1:23,908 --> 0:1:25,158
could relate to.


24
0:1:25,158 --> 0:1:27,68



25
0:1:27,68 --> 0:1:29,24
The owners of the restaurant
owned this


26
0:1:29,24 --> 0:1:30,28
restaurant for 10 years.


27
0:1:30,28 --> 0:1:32,76
It's never been busy, and they
were fine with that, because


28
0:1:32,76 --> 0:1:33,57
they owned the building.


29
0:1:33,57 --> 0:1:35,2
They just had this as kind
of like a hang out.


30
0:1:35,2 --> 0:1:37,46
We're kind of renting the
space off from them.


31
0:1:37,46 --> 0:1:39,16
And then with Mission Chinese
Food, we were like, well,


32
0:1:39,16 --> 0:1:41,37
let's just do this together,
and we'll find a


33
0:1:41,37 --> 0:1:42,43
way to make it work.


34
0:1:42,43 --> 0:1:44,17
Who bought milk?


35
0:1:44,17 --> 0:1:45,778
Whose gallon of milk is this?


36
0:1:45,778 --> 0:1:47,212
-Nobody bought milk.


37
0:1:47,212 --> 0:1:47,929
DANNY BOWIEN: Why
did anybody-- no


38
0:1:47,929 --> 0:1:49,602
Asians can drink milk!


39
0:1:49,602 --> 0:1:50,558
-It's good milk.


40
0:1:50,558 --> 0:1:53,92
It's good milk.


41
0:1:53,92 --> 0:1:55,38
DANNY BOWIEN: So we're
at the Commonwealth.


42
0:1:55,38 --> 0:1:58,615
We're picking up Yin, one of my
really good friends, and on


43
0:1:58,615 --> 0:2:1,25
our days off, we would always
eat Chinese food together.


44
0:2:1,25 --> 0:2:1,81
High five.


45
0:2:1,81 --> 0:2:2,16
Pound the beer.


46
0:2:2,16 --> 0:2:2,646
-High five.


47
0:2:2,646 --> 0:2:3,132
Pound the beer.


48
0:2:3,132 --> 0:2:5,76
Let's go.


49
0:2:5,76 --> 0:2:7,506
DANNY BOWIEN: The Commonwealth
is kind of the sister


50
0:2:7,506 --> 0:2:10,449
restaurant of Mission
Chinese Food.


51
0:2:10,449 --> 0:2:12,86
It's a young man's game,
beer pounding.


52
0:2:12,86 --> 0:2:13,296
All right.


53
0:2:13,296 --> 0:2:15,48
We've gotta go.


54
0:2:15,48 --> 0:2:17,2
Before I actually started
working in a Chinese


55
0:2:17,2 --> 0:2:19,9
restaurant, all my cook friends,
we would all just go


56
0:2:19,9 --> 0:2:21,97
out and eat Chinese food
on our day off.


57
0:2:21,97 --> 0:2:24,22
Because when you make fancy food
all the time, you don't


58
0:2:24,22 --> 0:2:25,79
feel like eating fancy
food on your day off.


59
0:2:25,79 --> 0:2:26,18
It's cool.


60
0:2:26,18 --> 0:2:28,21
Now all my friends work at fancy
restaurants, and I work


61
0:2:28,21 --> 0:2:30,67
at a shitty Chinese
restaurant.


62
0:2:30,67 --> 0:2:32,33
So we're going to Bar
Agricole right now.


63
0:2:32,33 --> 0:2:35,25
One of my best friends
in the world, Brandon


64
0:2:35,25 --> 0:2:36,59
Jew, is a chef there.


65
0:2:36,59 --> 0:2:38,9
To be honest, he's the
reason that I started


66
0:2:38,9 --> 0:2:40,11
making Chinese food.


67
0:2:40,11 --> 0:2:41,7
But he's Chinese.


68
0:2:41,7 --> 0:2:42,727
I think his dream still is
to make Chinese food.


69
0:2:42,727 --> 0:2:51,8



70
0:2:51,8 --> 0:2:52,61
Dude, so spice is over--


71
0:2:52,61 --> 0:2:54,13
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


72
0:2:54,13 --> 0:2:54,905
IAN MUNTZERT: Oh, what
the fuck you got?


73
0:2:54,905 --> 0:2:56,58
Oh, tiny pastries.


74
0:2:56,58 --> 0:2:58,404
BRANDON JEW: Yeah, try this.


75
0:2:58,404 --> 0:2:59,45
DANNY BOWIEN: Why are
you eating this?


76
0:2:59,45 --> 0:3:2,12
We're about to go eat fucking
spicy Chinese food.


77
0:3:2,12 --> 0:3:3,89
You're crazy!


78
0:3:3,89 --> 0:3:5,345
Dude, it's so good.


79
0:3:5,345 --> 0:3:6,53
BRANDON JEW: Hey, have you had
the coppa di testa here yet?


80
0:3:6,53 --> 0:3:6,98
DANNY BOWIEN: No.


81
0:3:6,98 --> 0:3:8,396
BRANDON JEW: I have
some, yeah.


82
0:3:8,396 --> 0:3:8,87
You want some?


83
0:3:8,87 --> 0:3:9,16
DANNY BOWIEN: Shut
the fuck up.


84
0:3:9,16 --> 0:3:10,21
We have to hurry, though.


85
0:3:10,21 --> 0:3:11,22
That place closes soon.


86
0:3:11,22 --> 0:3:13,3
He makes awesome charcuterie.


87
0:3:13,3 --> 0:3:14,342
BRANDON JEW: Here's the
snout right here.


88
0:3:14,342 --> 0:3:15,43
DANNY BOWIEN: Nice!


89
0:3:15,43 --> 0:3:18,0
IAN MUNTZERT: That's
gnarly as fuck.


90
0:3:18,0 --> 0:3:19,31
DANNY BOWIEN: So this
is like the--


91
0:3:19,31 --> 0:3:21,41
BRANDON JEW: Ears, you put the
tenderloin in there and the


92
0:3:21,41 --> 0:3:22,646
cheeks, and that's the tongue.


93
0:3:22,646 --> 0:3:23,66
DANNY BOWIEN: That's what
I eat late at night.


94
0:3:23,66 --> 0:3:25,29
Before I go home, I eat this.


95
0:3:25,29 --> 0:3:27,21
BRANDON JEW: We call
it rotolo di testa.


96
0:3:27,21 --> 0:3:32,98
It means a roll of head.


97
0:3:32,98 --> 0:3:34,56
It's melting, so we've
gotta eat it now.


98
0:3:34,56 --> 0:3:35,997
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah,
eat it fast.


99
0:3:35,997 --> 0:3:37,913
Let's crush this, and
then we should go.


100
0:3:37,913 --> 0:3:44,15



101
0:3:44,15 --> 0:3:46,45
What's your favorite
thing in SPiCES?


102
0:3:46,45 --> 0:3:47,1
IAN MUNTZERT: The
fucking pork.


103
0:3:47,1 --> 0:3:47,37
DANNY BOWIEN: Really?


104
0:3:47,37 --> 0:3:49,7
IAN MUNTZERT: Oh, fuck.


105
0:3:49,7 --> 0:3:52,79
And they send you like the whole
motherfucking shoulder.


106
0:3:52,79 --> 0:3:53,95
DANNY BOWIEN: Don't
really haul balls.


107
0:3:53,95 --> 0:3:54,92
I was joking.


108
0:3:54,92 --> 0:3:59,5
It's called SPiCES Szechuan
Trenz, with a Z.


109
0:3:59,5 --> 0:4:0,6
IAN MUNTZERT: It's kind of made
up to look like a really


110
0:4:0,6 --> 0:4:1,85
shitty Taiwanese nightclub.


111
0:4:1,85 --> 0:4:6,48



112
0:4:6,48 --> 0:4:7,81
DANNY BOWIEN: I think the good
thing about going to eat


113
0:4:7,81 --> 0:4:10,65
Chinese food is that the more
people you have, the better,


114
0:4:10,65 --> 0:4:12,76
because you can order
more stuff.


115
0:4:12,76 --> 0:4:13,96
All right, what are
you gonna get?


116
0:4:13,96 --> 0:4:15,14
IAN MUNTZERT: I'm gonna get the
pork shoulder and garlic


117
0:4:15,14 --> 0:4:18,29
sauce, and the dry braised
eel strips.


118
0:4:18,29 --> 0:4:19,66
DANNY BOWIEN: You wanna get
the spicy beef tendon?


119
0:4:19,66 --> 0:4:21,16
You guys are so quiet,
so that's a no.


120
0:4:21,16 --> 0:4:22,21
BRANDON JEW: Yeah.


121
0:4:22,21 --> 0:4:25,5
DANNY BOWIEN: What's your
favorite thing here?


122
0:4:25,5 --> 0:4:25,71
DANNY BOWIEN: I'll get that.


123
0:4:25,71 --> 0:4:26,85
These guys are wusses.


124
0:4:26,85 --> 0:4:28,13
BRANDON JEW: No, I
don't want that.


125
0:4:28,13 --> 0:4:29,21
DANNY BOWIEN: You're crazy!


126
0:4:29,21 --> 0:4:30,2
It's so good.


127
0:4:30,2 --> 0:4:31,535
It's very crispy.


128
0:4:31,535 --> 0:4:34,1
Right?


129
0:4:34,1 --> 0:4:35,0
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, never mind.


130
0:4:35,0 --> 0:4:36,98
I like the crispy ones.


131
0:4:36,98 --> 0:4:49,355



132
0:4:49,355 --> 0:4:51,335
IAN MUNTZERT: The cumin lamb's
fucking retarded good.


133
0:4:51,335 --> 0:4:54,305



134
0:4:54,305 --> 0:4:56,285
BRANDON JEW: I like their
[INAUDIBLE] better.


135
0:4:56,285 --> 0:4:59,46
DANNY BOWIEN: So this
thing is ridiculous.


136
0:4:59,46 --> 0:5:0,3
When have you had this before?


137
0:5:0,3 --> 0:5:2,69
BRANDON JEW: Every time
that I've been here--


138
0:5:2,69 --> 0:5:3,65
DANNY BOWIEN: That's crazy.


139
0:5:3,65 --> 0:5:5,15
BRANDON JEW: --since
the first time.


140
0:5:5,15 --> 0:5:7,778
DANNY BOWIEN: I don't wanna mess
with it, it's so awesome.


141
0:5:7,778 --> 0:5:9,77
BRANDON JEW: Look at
this [INAUDIBLE].


142
0:5:9,77 --> 0:5:10,77
DANNY BOWIEN: It's crazy, man.


143
0:5:10,77 --> 0:5:11,55
It's so nuts.


144
0:5:11,55 --> 0:5:14,174
BRANDON JEW: I'm at a loss
for words right now.


145
0:5:14,174 --> 0:5:16,9
DANNY BOWIEN: This thing
is no joke, my friend.


146
0:5:16,9 --> 0:5:17,551
This is no joke.


147
0:5:17,551 --> 0:5:21,45



148
0:5:21,45 --> 0:5:23,18
Oh, this is a blood thing.


149
0:5:23,18 --> 0:5:23,506
BRANDON JEW: Yeah.


150
0:5:23,506 --> 0:5:24,97
DANNY BOWIEN: Your favorite.


151
0:5:24,97 --> 0:5:25,946
I'm stoked, I'm excited.


152
0:5:25,946 --> 0:5:27,4
IAN MUNTZERT: Go ahead and put
it right in front of me.


153
0:5:27,4 --> 0:5:27,75
DANNY BOWIEN: No, if it's
your favorite, I'm


154
0:5:27,75 --> 0:5:29,8
excited to try it.


155
0:5:29,8 --> 0:5:29,72
I'm excited.


156
0:5:29,72 --> 0:5:31,36
BRANDON JEW: Good.


157
0:5:31,36 --> 0:5:32,743
DANNY BOWIEN: I'll
eat a blood.


158
0:5:32,743 --> 0:5:35,97
The intestine's good.


159
0:5:35,97 --> 0:5:38,425
I love this place, because I
came here the first time, and


160
0:5:38,425 --> 0:5:40,53
I'd never had food like
this before, ever.


161
0:5:40,53 --> 0:5:42,26
Like, ever, ever, ever.


162
0:5:42,26 --> 0:5:43,49
I'd never had Szechuan
food before.


163
0:5:43,49 --> 0:5:45,674
I mean, I grew up in Oklahoman,
and I ate, like, a


164
0:5:45,674 --> 0:5:49,52
lot of sweet and sour chicken,
and fried rice, and lo mein.


165
0:5:49,52 --> 0:5:51,2
But this is what really opened
my eyes to making


166
0:5:51,2 --> 0:5:52,29
stuff that's different.


167
0:5:52,29 --> 0:5:54,455
Every time I come here, I find
out about something else that


168
0:5:54,455 --> 0:5:55,19
I've never had before.


169
0:5:55,19 --> 0:5:56,5
Like, this thing
is ridiculous.


170
0:5:56,5 --> 0:5:58,8
I've never had this before.


171
0:5:58,8 --> 0:5:59,46
I have no chef telling
me what to do.


172
0:5:59,46 --> 0:6:2,49
I know how to do whatever
cooking I know, and then you


173
0:6:2,49 --> 0:6:5,226
come here, and you taste and
taste and taste, and you're


174
0:6:5,226 --> 0:6:6,68
like, how did they do that?


175
0:6:6,68 --> 0:6:9,11
And then you just try to
make it as good as--


176
0:6:9,11 --> 0:6:11,29
Just as good as, and if it's
better, then it's better.


177
0:6:11,29 --> 0:6:11,97
But just as good as.


178
0:6:11,97 --> 0:6:14,17
BRANDON JEW: The thing about
Danny is, it's crazy, because


179
0:6:14,17 --> 0:6:15,27
he can take--


180
0:6:15,27 --> 0:6:18,12
you just need to taste
something, and he can start


181
0:6:18,12 --> 0:6:19,66
recreating it.


182
0:6:19,66 --> 0:6:21,81
And then he'll start dorking
out about it.


183
0:6:21,81 --> 0:6:25,56
He'll be like, hey, come
over and try this shit.


184
0:6:25,56 --> 0:6:28,42
I got this idea from this
so-and-so place.


185
0:6:28,42 --> 0:6:31,42
And then, all of a sudden,
you're eating it, and it


186
0:6:31,42 --> 0:6:33,65
tastes even better than
the original version.


187
0:6:33,65 --> 0:6:34,3
DANNY BOWIEN: No.


188
0:6:34,3 --> 0:6:34,12
BRANDON JEW: It does.


189
0:6:34,12 --> 0:6:36,25
DANNY BOWIEN: That's arguable.


190
0:6:36,25 --> 0:6:38,595
BRANDON JEW: My frustration with
Chinese food was that no


191
0:6:38,595 --> 0:6:40,21
one was making it better.


192
0:6:40,21 --> 0:6:43,25
Like, David Chang was making
Korean food better in New


193
0:6:43,25 --> 0:6:45,45
York, and Charles Phan was doing
that with Vietnamese


194
0:6:45,45 --> 0:6:47,27
food out here.


195
0:6:47,27 --> 0:6:50,72
But no one was taking the torch
for Chinese food, and as


196
0:6:50,72 --> 0:6:55,16
a Chinese American, that was my
whole frustration was like,


197
0:6:55,16 --> 0:6:56,45
no one's taking the torch.


198
0:6:56,45 --> 0:6:56,8
I don't know.


199
0:6:56,8 --> 0:6:59,81
I'm just stoked that someone
is doing Chinese food.


200
0:6:59,81 --> 0:7:1,802
DANNY BOWIEN: We're getting
all bromance over here.


201
0:7:1,802 --> 0:7:5,7
IAN MUNTZERT: I think the reason
that your cooking is


202
0:7:5,7 --> 0:7:8,82
something more unique and more
interesting is that you take


203
0:7:8,82 --> 0:7:9,84
this role of beginner's
mindset to it.


204
0:7:9,84 --> 0:7:12,16
You know that you don't know
what you're doing.


205
0:7:12,16 --> 0:7:12,73
DANNY BOWIEN: I have no idea.


206
0:7:12,73 --> 0:7:14,58
IAN MUNTZERT: And you're just
trying to make something good.


207
0:7:14,58 --> 0:7:18,165
Whereas, like, everybody here
is so steeped in tradition


208
0:7:18,165 --> 0:7:20,13
that they're just going to make
it the way they've been


209
0:7:20,13 --> 0:7:22,79
told to do, and they're going
to care in varying degrees.


210
0:7:22,79 --> 0:7:24,5
BRANDON JEW: Yeah, you're
not playing that role.


211
0:7:24,5 --> 0:7:32,71



212
0:7:32,71 --> 0:7:34,54
DANNY BOWIEN: We're going back
to the restaurant right now,


213
0:7:34,54 --> 0:7:40,35
and we're going to make
a late night snack.


214
0:7:40,35 --> 0:7:42,556
IAN MUNTZERT: Because
we're all starving.


215
0:7:42,556 --> 0:7:43,806
DANNY BOWIEN: I could
eat more.


216
0:7:43,806 --> 0:7:54,273



217
0:7:54,273 --> 0:7:55,722
-How's your dins?


218
0:7:55,722 --> 0:7:57,73
-[INAUDIBLE]


219
0:7:57,73 --> 0:8:0,84
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh my God, dude.


220
0:8:0,84 --> 0:8:2,97
It's starting to get kind of
nuts, just so you know.


221
0:8:2,97 --> 0:8:4,94
The real question is gonna
be, whose hand gets


222
0:8:4,94 --> 0:8:5,93
fucking bitten off?


223
0:8:5,93 --> 0:8:7,56
IAN MUNTZERT: Hold on, why are
we not throwing these things


224
0:8:7,56 --> 0:8:9,5
into fucking boiling water?


225
0:8:9,5 --> 0:8:10,33
We need boiling water.


226
0:8:10,33 --> 0:8:11,555
Why the fuck are we cutting
these things up alive?


227
0:8:11,555 --> 0:8:12,635
DANNY BOWIEN: Because it's
salt and pepper crab.


228
0:8:12,635 --> 0:8:13,885
Ian, shut up.


229
0:8:13,885 --> 0:8:15,9



230
0:8:15,9 --> 0:8:16,55
I'm so drunk.


231
0:8:16,55 --> 0:8:17,9
You're not drunk.


232
0:8:17,9 --> 0:8:18,4
It's not fair.


233
0:8:18,4 --> 0:8:20,4
-I've been drinking
waiting for you.


234
0:8:20,4 --> 0:8:22,74
DANNY BOWIEN: All right,
sorry, sorry, sorry.


235
0:8:22,74 --> 0:8:24,5
I think people are
gonna be stoked.


236
0:8:24,5 --> 0:8:25,54
IAN MUNTZERT: All right, let me
clean one of these fuckers,


237
0:8:25,54 --> 0:8:27,69
because I've never
done this alive.


238
0:8:27,69 --> 0:8:29,29
Oh, dude, I got the
livest crab here.


239
0:8:29,29 --> 0:8:30,815
It does not want to die.


240
0:8:30,815 --> 0:8:33,61
It does not want to-- oh!


241
0:8:33,61 --> 0:8:34,48
Oh.


242
0:8:34,48 --> 0:8:36,7
BRANDON JEW: Flip him over
and give him a nap.


243
0:8:36,7 --> 0:8:39,44
IAN MUNTZERT: Fuck him, I'm
not giving him a nap!


244
0:8:39,44 --> 0:8:41,309
DANNY BOWIEN: You're just
going for the gold!


245
0:8:41,309 --> 0:8:44,99
IAN MUNTZERT: Oh, it's a lot
harder when it's raw, man.


246
0:8:44,99 --> 0:8:46,51
DANNY BOWIEN: Pull the
gills, pop the back.


247
0:8:46,51 --> 0:8:47,576
I don't know what I did.


248
0:8:47,576 --> 0:8:48,32
IAN MUNTZERT: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.


249
0:8:48,32 --> 0:8:49,75
From here, I got it.


250
0:8:49,75 --> 0:8:50,405
The little fucker.


251
0:8:50,405 --> 0:8:52,81
I got it, I got it, I got it.


252
0:8:52,81 --> 0:8:53,39
DANNY BOWIEN: Don't
cut your hand off.


253
0:8:53,39 --> 0:8:55,54
This is where you
cut your hand.


254
0:8:55,54 --> 0:8:56,88
IAN MUNTZERT: I'm not cutting
my fucking hand off.


255
0:8:56,88 --> 0:8:57,74
DANNY BOWIEN: This is where
drunken cooking goes wrong.


256
0:8:57,74 --> 0:8:59,12
IAN MUNTZERT: Oh, no,
I'm familiar with--


257
0:8:59,12 --> 0:8:59,74
oh, really?


258
0:8:59,74 --> 0:9:2,345
Oh, no!


259
0:9:2,345 --> 0:9:3,63
BRANDON JEW: Stop him!


260
0:9:3,63 --> 0:9:4,29
DANNY BOWIEN: Ian, stop.


261
0:9:4,29 --> 0:9:6,1
You're eating that one.


262
0:9:6,1 --> 0:9:6,84
IAN MUNTZERT: Fine,
I'll eat this one.


263
0:9:6,84 --> 0:9:8,25
We're throwing it in
a fucking wok.


264
0:9:8,25 --> 0:9:10,4
-Face before tail.


265
0:9:10,4 --> 0:9:12,515
IAN MUNTZERT: After I ripped
its dick off, it


266
0:9:12,515 --> 0:9:13,909
fucking cut me, dude.


267
0:9:13,909 --> 0:9:19,398



268
0:9:19,398 --> 0:9:21,31
DANNY BOWIEN: I don't even
remember cooking anything last


269
0:9:21,31 --> 0:9:25,46
night, but we cooked a
bunch of crazy food.


270
0:9:25,46 --> 0:9:28,22
Let's chop these crabs,
then, huh?


271
0:9:28,22 --> 0:9:30,79
What is with all these
Slim Jims over here?


272
0:9:30,79 --> 0:9:33,7
I feel like we're just doing
what we want to do.


273
0:9:33,7 --> 0:9:36,37
When you're able to just have
100% creative freedom, and do


274
0:9:36,37 --> 0:9:39,364
what you want to do, that
comes across and you can


275
0:9:39,364 --> 0:9:40,614
connect to people.


276
0:9:40,614 --> 0:9:44,234



277
0:9:44,234 --> 0:9:45,18
IAN MUNTZERT: Fuck yes.


278
0:9:45,18 --> 0:9:46,38
BRANDON JEW: Danny Bowein.


279
0:9:46,38 --> 0:9:47,68
DANNY BOWIEN: Wait, you
have to wait for this.


280
0:9:47,68 --> 0:9:49,73
This is the salt and pepper
dungeness crab


281
0:9:49,73 --> 0:9:51,846
with mapo tofu sauce.


282
0:9:51,846 --> 0:9:54,206
Eew!


283
0:9:54,206 --> 0:9:56,32
Shut your mouth.


284
0:9:56,32 --> 0:9:57,84
We'll see where it
goes, you know?


285
0:9:57,84 --> 0:9:59,82
I don't think I'm going to be
making Chinese food when I'm


286
0:9:59,82 --> 0:10:1,2
45 or anything like that.


287
0:10:1,2 --> 0:10:2,55
We'll see.


288
0:10:2,55 --> 0:10:4,35
The dream was, like, oh, I
just want to work at a


289
0:10:4,35 --> 0:10:6,41
restaurant where I cook what I
want to eat on my day off, and


290
0:10:6,41 --> 0:10:7,93
that was was what this was.


291
0:10:7,93 --> 0:10:12,912
And it still is, but now
I kind of want salads.


292
0:10:12,912 --> 0:10:15,53
Greg, pound a beer.


293
0:10:15,53 --> 0:10:16,33
Tonight?


294
0:10:16,33 --> 0:10:18,89
I feel like it turned
out awesome.


295
0:10:18,89 --> 0:10:21,932
All right, guys, thanks
for coming.


296
0:10:21,932 --> 0:10:23,182
Good night.


297
0:10:23,182 --> 0:10:26,712
