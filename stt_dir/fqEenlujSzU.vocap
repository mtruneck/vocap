###32 They'll finish soon, we'll have a quiet Sunday.
###35 (Loud grinding)
###37 - Jesus. - We'll just have to blank it out.
###41 Hi. Hi. Erm, I was wondering if you could do a book search for me?
###45 I'm looking for a biography of Schubert.
###48 So if you could hunt it up for me, I'll wait here.
###54 What kind of coffee do you do?
###58 This is a book shop, we don't do coffee.
###61 - The other book shops do. - Listen, you...
###63 (Drowned out by grinding)
###72 This Schubert, this book search, how does it work?
###76 Well, you know. You just... and it pops up.
###81 We've a different sort of...
###85 here.
###87 Get on your knees.
###89 Put your hands on the floor.
###91 From where you are now to that far corner is our music section.
###96 It's a bit mixed up with aviation, botany and pregnancy.
###100 - Search! - (Thunderous grinding)
###106 That is the kind of thing that is going to put customers off.
###110 - (Grinding resumes) - Go and see when the noise will stop!
###118 - (Grinding stops) - Well?
###120 - (Grinding) - (Drowned out)
###124 - (Grinding stops) - What?

###139 So what did he say?
###141 He'll start again after lunch, it'll get worse tomorrow.
###144 - They wake you? - Seven o'clock. I was doing my t'ai chi.
###149 It's not actually illegal to kill a builder.
###152 Hey, hey, hey! It's Sunday, right?
###155 - Yes. - And we want to get away?
###157 - Yes. - Why don't we...
###159 go to the park?
###162 Did that suggestion deserve the preface "Hey, hey, hey"?
###167 - What about the cinema? - Let's see.
###171 OK, how about this?
###174 "Bouffant. Sandra Bullock sets up a tiny hairdresser's
###178 "in the trenches of the First World War."
###180 - No. - What else?
###184 Here we go - "Regression.
###186 "Richard Gere kills himself to go into the past
###190 "to rescue himself as a child so he can grow up to kill himself
###193 "to rescue himself as a child so he can..."
###196 - No! - There must be something else.
###198 What's this?
###200 "Blue Tunes. Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver."
###204 - I hate her. - "Grouchy Leonard Blue
###207 "runs a record shop with halfwit moustachioed assistant Danny."
###211 Ha!
###213 "When they team up with neurotic neighbour Pam
###216 "things become a riot of laughs."
###218 Where do they get this crap? A child could...
###221 - They think we're idiots. - Wankers.
###224 They all think they're great.
###226 (Sighs) We have to do something.
###229 Er, the usual, please.
###231 - What is your usual? - I haven't decided yet.
###235 I quite like the idea of asking for the usual.
###238 Come on, let's get back. He must be gone, it's lunch.
###242 The usual.
###244 (American accent) Hey, the usual, please.
###247 Er, usual, please.
###249 (Posh accent) Can I have the usual? Usual, please.
###256 (Whirring and banging)
###260 We have to do something!
###262 Let's go out for Sunday lunch.
###264 - All right. - Where? Where?
###266 There's this new place, very in - The Mortuary.
###271 No vegetables, everything's dead animals on little headstones.
###276 Why does it have to be fancy?
###278 I just want sausage, mash and a bit of cake.
###281 Not twigs fried in honey or a donkey in a coffin.
###285 Let's go to that place that does chicken and things.
###288 - OK. Oh, what shall we wear? - Excuse me?
###292 - What sort of place is it? - A restaurant.
###295 Shall we dress up or down? - You can dress upside down, inside out,
###299 you'll still eat your spaghetti like a pig.
###301 - Can we just go to lunch? - Give us a minute,
###304 I have to get my contact lenses.
###309 (Banging)
###320 Ber... Ber-Ber-Ber-Ber-Ber-Ber-Ber...
###323 Fix her, will you?
###325 Ber-Ber-Bernard, they're building for two weeks, there's a sign. We can't stay.
###331 - (Grinding) - I'll sort them out later.
###334 - What are you gonna do? - What can you do?
###336 I'll write to the council.
###338 - What are you gonna say? - I'll say, "Dear Council...
###344 "Please don't build beside us for the next two weeks."
###348 - What if that doesn't work? - Yeah, what are you gonna do?
###351 - Wanna know what I'll do? - Yeah.
###354 I will... drink heavily and shout at you!
###356 - (Grinding) - But I won't hear cos I'll be in Drillsville!
###360 Then I'll write to you as well!
###362 - (Grinding stops) - We'll have to go away.
###365 It's perfect, it's a good excuse to have a holiday.
###369 - Come on, we all need a change. - (Grinding)
###371 We're not going anywhere!
###373 - This place'll be hell. - I am not going on holiday.
###376 - Wait. - (Grinding stops)
###380 Look, look.
###382 - What's this? - Photos of my trip.
###384 Ooh, it's lovely. Is it Bali?
###386 - Mauritius. Well? Well? - What?
###390 They're like any holiday photographs,
###393 people stood about squinting who didn't realise they were that fat.
###397 That's us outside a restaurant. And that's us outside a hotel.
###401 Whoo! What a transformation!
###404 Oh, and - ha - that's Eddie, he was our map reader,
###407 he's a gallery owner but, er, he lives in Kent.
###413 This is the only one of the whole group.
###415 Probably one of the few times in my life when I've been truly happy.
###422 Why are you showing me these? I don't know these people.
###426 The only use this photograph would be to me
###429 would be if I was a hit man and somebody asked me to kill Eddie,
###433 the gallery owner from Trent.
###435 - Kent. - I don't care!
###437 - I'm not going. - Fine.
###439 We'll go. You stay and get your head drilled to bits.
###443 We are going to sunbathe, read, and have silly drinks on a beach.
###446 Beach? No! I want the unknown -
###449 mystery, strange places, snakes, jungle.
###452 Manny, I am not going to spend my holiday in a snake pit.
###456 - Shut up. Where's this sign? - Outside.
###460 There must be somewhere that has jungle AND beach.
###464 What do you do in there, anyway, in a jungle?
###467 Well, you see how many miles you can walk in a day.
###471 Yeah, but the heat - you must get so dehydrated.
###475 Yeah, well, in a tight spot you can always drink your own urine.
###479 Yeah, but what about the insects? And how do you wash?
###483 That's not such a big priority when you're quaffing pints of your own whizz.
###497 Excuse me, sorry. Could I just...? Thank you.
###510 Thanks.
###524 - Perfect. - I'll sort it.
###526 Don't get ripped off. Book it after lunch.
###529 Forget lunch.
###531 - And I'm not going to Thailand. - You said you weren't going anywhere.
###535 Doo-dah didn't say they're building round the clock.
###538 So forget beaches and jungles,
###540 we're going where I can read, sit, and have a quiet drink.
###544 So your ideal holiday would in fact be here?
###547 Correct. So find somewhere exactly like this.
###551 With a jungle.
###554 And a bit of beach? We're never gonna find anything.
###557 Here we are - "The sunlit island of Saint-Honor√©.
###561 "A tropical jungle engirdled with golden sands
###564 "boasting the hemisphere's only English book shop and bar."
###568 - I suppose that'll have to do. - And it's got a website.
###571 Manny, do the flights. I'll get the essentials.
###574 - Where are you going? - To pack. Back in two minutes.
###578 Right. Better get cracking. Get the suitcase...
###581 (Whirring)
###585 Right, what do we need?
###587 What do we need? Ah.
###590 Sun cream, first-aid kit, sunglasses,
###593 cologne, and... yep.
###597 Get rid of the rubbish.
###604 Good, you're putting stuff in. Thanks for helping.
###607 Phrase books, traveller's cheques, insect stuff...
###611 - Music! - Music, good point.
###613 - (Drilling) - CD player, CDs...
###616 and... clothes.
###625 Crap.
###626 Crap, crap, crap, crap.
###632 Right. And very important - malaria pills.
###640 - Right. - Good thinking.
###642 - Would you get the corkscrew? - Yep.
###647 There you go.
###649 Now, that's what I call teamwork.
###654 (Crash)
###671 - You done? - You've been ages!
###673 What's in the bag?
###675 (Panting) Oh, it's nothing. Just, you know, women's bits.
###679 Walk away from the bag.
###683 Manny.
###687 No! Don't open it! It's private!
###690 It's girls' things! No!
###693 Just as I thought! Put her in the chair.
###695 No! No! No! No!
###708 We're here to help you.
###710 You don't understand.
###712 We understand that you're ill.
###723 When you've learned to be sensible, you can have this.
###731 - You don't really need these. - Of course I do.
###734 They're my slow dancing mules.
###737 And you don't need these.
###739 I do. Suppose we're invited to a... yacht party by drug dealers.
###745 Two pairs, more than you need.
###747 Just one more! Take something else out.
###751 No, contact lenses and emergency money, throw it away.
###757 Erm, erm... Show me those.
###759 Those. And those. Those.
###762 You can take one pair.
###766 Oh, I... I can't decide.
###770 You can't make me choose.
###772 What's it to be? One pair! Come on!
###774 Oh, erm... Well, those ones are comfortable.
###777 - Right, in they go. - No! Wait!
###779 - Show me those ones again. - These are weird.
###783 They are beautiful.
###786 They make strong men cry in train stations. Put them in.
###790 Right, well, that's your lot.
###794 Bernard, got your passport?
###796 For God's sake, of course I do.
###798 Actually, I don't. Go and get it.
###800 - Where is it? - Where does anybody keep them?
###805 It's in the... building.
###808 Bernard, go and get it. We all have to work together.
###811 All right, all right.
###814 So, we have everything?
###816 Yep, let's just check the list to be double super-safety sure.
###820 I'll stop you if we've missed something.
###823 Right, OK. 1950s-style windbreaker
###826 with two-tone lining and self-stripe cuffs.
###829 - Sta-Prest peach slacks... - Manny.
###832 Let's just say clothes.
###834 Yeah, all right. Done.
###837 We have traveller's cheques, insurance, Bernard's getting his passport.
###840 Sun screen, insect repellent, phrase books?
###843 - Jawohl. - Booked the taxi?
###845 - Done! - Saint-Honor√© here we come!
###847 What time is the flight?
###850 The... Hmm?
###853 You didn't book the flights.
###856 I'm so sorry, I got distracted by the...
###858 And, erm...
###862 My... my pants aren't that easy to fold.
###866 Not a problem. It's on the net, you said.
###870 Yeah. Easy, easy.
###877 (Beeping, dialling)
###880 (Data transfer noise)
###886 OK, what's the name of the site?
###888 Er, yeah, I know, it's, erm... Holiday... ding dot thing.
###894 Er, no, no. Erm... Holiday at...
###898 dot...
###901 ...holiday. Quick, quick.
###908 I wanted it to be safe.
###913 Ha!
###917 No, that's not it. This button doesn't work, look.
###921 You are pressing my hand.
###925 Manny, you must remember the name of the site.
###928 Ah! Naughty little passport.
###932 Hiding in the crisps again!
###951 Manny, we have been doing this now for five hours.
###957 Where did you see the name of the site?
###960 - In the papers. - Which bit?
###962 The travel section.
###964 Which is open just there on the top, isn't it?
###967 Yep, yep.
###972 Could you read the ad out from the paper to me, please?
###976 "Fly-Saint-Honor√©. Com."
###980 I had it in my hand. I wanted it to be safe.
###985 I went over here...
###988 - Where can it be? - Right, got it.
###991 - Oh, Fran, you're a genius. - We can't go, I've no passport.
###994 - Have you checked your desk? - What? No.
###997 Oh, yes, there it is.
###1002 Right. Sorted. We've got a bargain. Better go to bed,
###1005 it's an early flight, saves us money.
###1008 - I'll get us up. - No. You can't be trusted.
###1011 - I'm staying awake. - Yeah, I'd better kip here.
###1014 - Can I have your bed? - Yeah.
###1017 - Got any bin liners? - In the kitchen.
###1023 - And, er, Dettol? - Under the sink.
###1027 - Ajax? - Yeah, just here.
###1029 Thanks.
###1031 Are you really actually gonna get in the bed?
###1034 - Yeah. - Right. Erm...
###1036 - Take these. - No, I'm not hungry.
###1039 No, it's not for you. Just chuck 'em under the bed.
###1042 What...? What's... what's under the bed?
###1045 Dunno.
###1048 We just call it the Thing.
###1056 (Bernard moans)
###1059 (Car horn toots)
###1072 - Come on, come on! - Come on!
###1075 Wake up! Wake up! Get up!
###1076 Cab's outside, come on!
###1078 Hmm? Come on! Hmm?
###1080 Final check. Final.
###1083 Good.
###1084 Good. Come on!
###1087 Come on!
###1089 Wake up! Get up!
###1093 Listen, there's a slight catch.
###1096 These flights are very cheap.
###1098 Four quid each.
###1100 Quite reasonable, yes.
###1102 So we have to make a couple of changeovers.
###1105 - (Bernard) How does that work? - Well, to get to the Canaries
###1109 we have to change...
###1111 (Clears throat)... in New Zealand.
###1113 What? That's practically in France!
###1115 - I know. - Why don't we just go there?
###1118 We could have sake at the rodeo and go home on a sled with camels.
###1122 We're just refuelling.
###1124 And then we change again at...
###1126 (Clears throat)... Stansted.
###1128 I've always wanted to go there.
###1130 - Nice, is it? - They've got these trains
###1133 that have no driver.
###1135 Ah? Have they?
###1138 We'll just be there for a few days.
###1140 In and around the airport.
###1142 - In, mostly. - That's where the trains are.
###1146 And then it's straight on to sunny Saint-Honor√©!
###1150 (PA) 'Would passengers Black, Bianco and Katzenjammer
###1154 - 'please go to gate 4.' - That's us.
###1156 Wait, wait. Let's see if they do it again.
###1159 'Passengers Black, Bianco and Katzenjammer,
###1163 - 'please go to gate 4 now.' - (AII cheer)
###1175 It must be the last connection. We must be nearly home.
###1178 - Is this Prague? - I don't care.
###1181 I'm not getting on another plane.
###1183 I think this is Miami.
###1185 Fine. I'm gonna live here and sell guns to children.
###1189 - You liked Saint-Honor√©. - I did!
###1192 I thoroughly enjoyed our four hours there.
###1195 You can't say the flights weren't cheap.
###1198 And you can't say we didn't spend 13 days on a plane.
###1202 574.
###1204 574 what?
###1207 I kept them all.
###1210 574 of these little towel things.
###1214 Let's get a drink.
###1216 This might be Nairobi.
###1220 No, it's definitely Minsk.
###1222 You're both wrong. It's obvious.
###1224 He's got all the trademark piercings.
###1230 Hakim yoba hara hakhyakh!
###1237 Uloddivisholov neinsbar.
###1242 (Clears throat)
###1244 Anvill kerrigan godean lethes.
###1249 (SIowly) Where are we?
###1251 - Heathrow, love. - Oh, hey, we're home!
###1255 Ohhh. Erm, three glasses of Merlot, please.
###1258 (Sighs)
###1260 Oh, don't look at me like that. Hey, it wasn't all bad.
###1264 How many people can say they've been on a hospital river boat?
###1268 And you can be sure they didn't get to operate on themselves.
###1272 Just as well they thought Manny was a god.
###1275 It'll be some time before I want to sacrifice another monkey.
###1279 We said we wouldn't talk about Canada!
###1282 Let's go home.
###1284 - Have you got your keys? - No.
###1286 I left them in the bag which you kindly lost.
###1290 Ah.
###1292 What do you mean, "Ah"?
###1294 Well, I think that...
###1296 my keys were in there as well.
###1298 Were they? Funny, isn't it, travel?
###1301 Just one thing after another.
###1303 - You're fired. - Oh, now, look.
###1305 And after I dislodge and return your thong,
###1309 I never want to see you again either.
###1316 (Grunts)
###1318 Do you want to jump?
###1320 - I came down gradually... - Get away from me!
###1323 It was a thrill to recreate with you but now our association ends.
###1327 You have brought nothing but pain, penury
###1331 and strife into my days.
###1334 I wish you good fortune in whatever avenue of life
###1337 you assault with your presence.
###1339 Here's your redundancy package.
###1342 Sorry it's in Phrenobian wooden dollars
###1344 but that's largely your fault!
###1346 Now, good luck and goodbye!
###1349 You can't run the place on your own.
###1351 I'll struggle on somehow.
###1357 No. I don't accept your apology.
###1359 Give it another 30 years. And take this with you.
###1361 - Bernard. - What?
###1364 - Do you want to come outside? - I'm cold.
###1366 I have got chilblains, tinnitus and thrush!
###1370 If you want to fight, come inside.
###1389 (Maniacal giggling)
###1394 (Simian gibbering)
###1398 The noise. Th-th-th-th-the noise!
###1401 B-b-b-b-b-b-but found it.
###1403 Found it! I found it!
###1412 Manny, could you look after the shop by yourself for a while?
###1416 - Sure. - What are you going to do?
###1419 I am going on holiday.
