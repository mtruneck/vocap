0:0:1,327 --> 0:0:4,7
<i>One of the best things</i>
<i>about friendship with Turk</i>


2
0:0:4,7 --> 0:0:6,447
<i>is challenging each other</i>
<i>to try new things,</i>


3
0:0:6,447 --> 0:0:8,927
l can't believe we're
going to a strip club.


4
0:0:8,927 --> 0:0:12,47
l don't think about it that way.
lt's a place to buy a burger


5
0:0:12,47 --> 0:0:15,247
that's a two-and-a-half mile
walk away from the hospital.


6
0:0:15,247 --> 0:0:17,567
No skin! We all win!


7
0:0:17,567 --> 0:0:20,287
Let's get outta here
before we end up on the news.


8
0:0:20,287 --> 0:0:22,447
Are you gentlemen
visiting the club?


9
0:0:22,447 --> 0:0:25,7
No, we're protesting.


10
0:0:25,7 --> 0:0:26,927
l'm worried about the kids.


11
0:0:26,927 --> 0:0:29,87
So what's that in your pocket?


12
0:0:29,87 --> 0:0:31,927
This is... lt's $38 in singles.


13
0:0:31,927 --> 0:0:36,607
l bought a newspaper
and this is the change from my 40.


14
0:0:36,607 --> 0:0:39,127
Neil...


15
0:0:39,127 --> 0:0:41,407
Sir...


16
0:0:41,407 --> 0:0:44,687
- No pulse.
- Starting CPR.


17
0:0:44,687 --> 0:0:47,607
Call an ambulance!


18
0:0:47,607 --> 0:0:53,327
Coming to you live as two young doctors
are trying to resuscitate my cameraman.


19
0:0:53,327 --> 0:0:55,887
Well, maybe l'm biased, but to me,


20
0:0:55,887 --> 0:0:58,967
every doctor here at Sacred Heart
is a hero.


21
0:0:58,967 --> 0:1:2,727
Does that mean l'm a hero? l don't know.


22
0:1:2,727 --> 0:1:4,967
There's my dynamic duo!


23
0:1:4,967 --> 0:1:7,327
Dr Dorian! Dr Turk!


24
0:1:7,327 --> 0:1:9,487
Holy inferiority complex, Batman!


25
0:1:9,487 --> 0:1:12,967
How low is my self-esteem that
l'm the sidekick in my own fantasy?


26
0:1:12,967 --> 0:1:16,87
lt could be worse, Robin.
You could be Alfred the butler.


27
0:1:16,87 --> 0:1:19,87
Damn you, sir.


28
0:1:19,87 --> 0:1:22,167
<i>Life in a hospital moves fast,</i>
<i>One second you're a hero</i>


29
0:1:22,167 --> 0:1:24,927
<i>the next you're obsessing</i>
<i>about evaluations,</i>


30
0:1:24,927 --> 0:1:28,127
- Who cares? lt's only a grade.
- Really? What did you get?


31
0:1:28,127 --> 0:1:32,367
A-plus. l turned on the waterworks and
the resident changed it to A-plus-plus.


32
0:1:32,367 --> 0:1:35,807
- A proud day for women everywhere.
- Why are you worried?


33
0:1:35,807 --> 0:1:39,527
With the hero thing, whoever
evaluates you will give you a gold star.


34
0:1:39,527 --> 0:1:42,927
Listen, Supergirl. l'm gonna
break you into so many pieces


35
0:1:42,927 --> 0:1:47,367
that my grandmother, who can do
a 1 ,000-piece puzzle in an hour,


36
0:1:47,367 --> 0:1:49,807
will never be able
to put you back together,


37
0:1:49,807 --> 0:1:53,407
even if she goes go back in time
to when her vision was perfect.


38
0:1:53,407 --> 0:2:11,87
Somehow l doubt it.


39
0:2:11,87 --> 0:2:14,767
Before you deny you like looking
at strange naked women again,


40
0:2:14,767 --> 0:2:18,727
l should remind you that when you stay
at my place, it's not a hotel.


41
0:2:18,727 --> 0:2:22,167
The movie titles do come up on the bill.


42
0:2:22,167 --> 0:2:24,687
l'm sticking with ''we were protesting.''
JD?


43
0:2:24,687 --> 0:2:27,487
Outraged and disgusted.


44
0:2:27,487 --> 0:2:35,327
Take Bambi out tonight. Maybe
with the hype you can get him a girl.


45
0:2:35,327 --> 0:2:39,407
Who hasn't bought us drinks yet?


46
0:2:39,407 --> 0:2:43,647
lt could happen.


47
0:2:43,647 --> 0:2:46,327
- Don't wait up for me tonight.
- OK.


48
0:2:46,327 --> 0:2:48,687
Do you wanna get drunk
and beg me for sex now


49
0:2:48,687 --> 0:2:51,127
or wait till two o'clock tonight?


50
0:2:51,127 --> 0:2:53,527
- Let's wait.
- Cool.


51
0:2:53,527 --> 0:2:57,527
You know, l'm off tonight.
What are you doing, Carla?


52
0:2:57,527 --> 0:3:0,487
Just having dinner
with a friend.


53
0:3:0,487 --> 0:3:3,567
<i>Man this is so uncomfortable,</i>


54
0:3:3,567 --> 0:3:6,47
<i>She's not gonna get the invite,</i>


55
0:3:6,47 --> 0:3:8,327
<i>Just hold your breath until it's over,</i>


56
0:3:8,327 --> 0:3:16,647
You could take Elliot with you.


57
0:3:16,647 --> 0:3:20,567
Great. l can't wait.


58
0:3:20,567 --> 0:3:24,767
Have a good time tonight.


59
0:3:24,767 --> 0:3:26,47
Lose something?


60
0:3:26,47 --> 0:3:29,807
No, why? Did you take something?


61
0:3:29,807 --> 0:3:31,727
- No.
- What'd you take?


62
0:3:31,727 --> 0:3:33,447
Nothing.


63
0:3:33,447 --> 0:3:35,287
What'd you take?


64
0:3:35,287 --> 0:3:37,487
Newbie. Come.


65
0:3:37,487 --> 0:3:41,7
<i>Now I think about it I'm psyched</i>
<i>to have Dr Cox do my evaluation,</i>


66
0:3:41,7 --> 0:3:43,647
<i>It'll be a chance to see</i>
<i>what he thinks of me,</i>


67
0:3:43,647 --> 0:3:47,127
Look, Doogie,
l'm up to my cha-chas in busywork,


68
0:3:47,127 --> 0:3:50,367
so l'm gonna take a rain check
on your report card


69
0:3:50,367 --> 0:3:54,407
and have you do it yourself.


70
0:3:54,407 --> 0:3:56,527
You didn't even fill out my name.


71
0:3:56,527 --> 0:4:0,607
Well, now, l think it's John,
or Jimmy or Ji or hmm.


72
0:4:0,607 --> 0:4:2,967
lt's in the J family.


73
0:4:2,967 --> 0:4:8,527
But if you get in trouble,
just ask the nurses for help.


74
0:4:8,527 --> 0:4:11,687
Sir, l've been the hospital's
legal counsel for,


75
0:4:11,687 --> 0:4:16,7
well, let's just say,
when l started, l had hair.


76
0:4:16,7 --> 0:4:19,447
And a wife and family.


77
0:4:19,447 --> 0:4:21,967
The point is, l'll never get a raise


78
0:4:21,967 --> 0:4:24,767
without support
of senior staff like yourself.


79
0:4:24,767 --> 0:4:29,327
- Can't do it.
- Well, you did what you could.


80
0:4:29,327 --> 0:4:31,207
Dr Dorian, how are you?


81
0:4:31,207 --> 0:4:34,447
- These evaluations...
- Just a pleasantry, keep it moving.


82
0:4:34,447 --> 0:4:39,87
Listen, all the publicity you
and your friend have been getting,


83
0:4:39,87 --> 0:4:41,647
it would be silly
not to milk it a little bit.


84
0:4:41,647 --> 0:4:48,327
See if we can't promote the hospital,
what do you say?


85
0:4:48,327 --> 0:4:52,167
OK, whose breasts
haven't l signed yet?


86
0:4:52,167 --> 0:4:54,7
- lt could happen.
- Excuse me?


87
0:4:54,7 --> 0:4:56,607
Anything for the hospital.


88
0:4:56,607 --> 0:5:0,87
- So what are we doing tonight?
- Go out to dinner, l guess.


89
0:5:0,87 --> 0:5:1,887
Dinner! Where are we gonna eat?


90
0:5:1,887 --> 0:5:6,47
- Don't know, some restaurant.
- Some restaurant!


91
0:5:6,47 --> 0:5:10,287
Be honest...
Does this look hip enough?


92
0:5:10,287 --> 0:5:13,727
Since when are khakis, a pink shirt
and a neckerchief not hip?


93
0:5:13,727 --> 0:5:17,127
True.


94
0:5:17,127 --> 0:5:19,367
- Hi.
- Hey, Darryl.


95
0:5:19,367 --> 0:5:24,967
l have to make a quick call.
So, Patricia, Darryl, this is Elliot.


96
0:5:24,967 --> 0:5:27,127
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.


97
0:5:27,127 --> 0:5:29,247
- l'm gonna get out of here.
- OK.


98
0:5:29,247 --> 0:5:31,327
Thanks for the ride.


99
0:5:31,327 --> 0:5:34,807
- Someone's a cradle-robber.
- Darryl's my son.


100
0:5:34,807 --> 0:5:38,647
The only way he could be your son
was if you had him when you were 1 5.


101
0:5:38,647 --> 0:5:41,207
1 4.


102
0:5:41,207 --> 0:5:42,887
l was close.


103
0:5:42,887 --> 0:5:47,167
l'm sorry, that was my mom.
l'm gonna have to cancel.


104
0:5:47,167 --> 0:5:49,7
<i>I can't evaluate myself,</i>


105
0:5:49,7 --> 0:5:52,607
Would you describe me
as warm, professional, or both?


106
0:5:52,607 --> 0:5:55,167
l'd describe you as ''l'm on my lunch.''


107
0:5:55,167 --> 0:5:58,167
l don't know whether to
be easy or hard on myself...


108
0:5:58,167 --> 0:6:1,527
Can't you see l'm watching my stories?


109
0:6:1,527 --> 0:6:6,47
<i>I can't honey</i>
<i>Parker wants me to assist,</i>


110
0:6:6,47 --> 0:6:8,727
Dr Cox. Have you been here
the whole time?


111
0:6:8,727 --> 0:6:12,767
No, l just came in
through the couch door. Move.


112
0:6:12,767 --> 0:6:15,247
You said you were too busy
to do my evaluation.


113
0:6:15,247 --> 0:6:17,47
l am.


114
0:6:17,47 --> 0:6:20,167
Didn't her daddy sell the coalmine?


115
0:6:20,167 --> 0:6:26,127
- Contract didn't stick.
- That's interesting.


116
0:6:26,127 --> 0:6:30,927
We're almost ready. Anything you
wanna say before we get started?


117
0:6:30,927 --> 0:6:33,847
Yeah, l've got something to say
to Dr Cox.


118
0:6:33,847 --> 0:6:38,607
l'm gonna give you the best damn
evaluation that you ever did see.


119
0:6:38,607 --> 0:6:42,887
And this Friday,
at the Steel Cage Medi-Slam,


120
0:6:42,887 --> 0:6:47,287
l'm gonna give you a physical
you ain't never gonna forget.


121
0:6:47,287 --> 0:6:52,967
l'm gonna probe ya,
cos l'm The lntern.


122
0:6:52,967 --> 0:6:55,567
Nothing. OK, l'll be right back.


123
0:6:55,567 --> 0:7:0,647
She is tasty. Watch me work
a cat and mouse game with her.


124
0:7:0,647 --> 0:7:2,407
She's married to the soundman.


125
0:7:2,407 --> 0:7:6,487
That thing clipped to your collar,
that's a microphone.


126
0:7:6,487 --> 0:7:12,407
l'm so sorry.
And l love ZZ Top.


127
0:7:12,407 --> 0:7:14,247
l'm not looking forward to this.


128
0:7:14,247 --> 0:7:17,567
OK, we're rolling.
So, how's my cameraman doing?


129
0:7:17,567 --> 0:7:22,327
Good enough that he asked me
for mouth-to-mouth again.


130
0:7:22,327 --> 0:7:24,807
Dr Turk, are there
any specific challenges


131
0:7:24,807 --> 0:7:30,807
being a young black doctor
in an inner city hospital?


132
0:7:30,807 --> 0:7:34,487
l wanna hear this.
ls it possible to turn up the volume?


133
0:7:34,487 --> 0:7:47,167
That's as high as it goes.


134
0:7:47,167 --> 0:7:57,207
Listen, let me tell you what happened.


135
0:7:57,207 --> 0:7:58,527
Damn.


136
0:7:58,527 --> 0:8:3,167
When l saw that it was missing,
did you not think l'd come to you?


137
0:8:3,167 --> 0:8:6,127
l don't know what you're talking about.


138
0:8:6,127 --> 0:8:9,447
So you're gonna play it that way, huh?


139
0:8:9,447 --> 0:8:16,487
Touché.


140
0:8:16,487 --> 0:8:19,247
- l finished my evaluation.
- Great.


141
0:8:19,247 --> 0:8:23,607
l thought it would take longer so the
marching band won't be here until later.


142
0:8:23,607 --> 0:8:26,367
Enjoy. l think you'll find
it's a good read.


143
0:8:26,367 --> 0:8:28,967
Hey, Newbie.
This thing actually does matter,


144
0:8:28,967 --> 0:8:31,567
so were you completely honest
with yourself?


145
0:8:31,567 --> 0:8:34,167
Yeah.


146
0:8:34,167 --> 0:8:38,527
Say it right into the camera, hotshot.


147
0:8:38,527 --> 0:8:42,7
Now you can have this thing back
any time you want.


148
0:8:42,7 --> 0:8:45,967
You're gonna have to
bark like a dog, though.


149
0:8:45,967 --> 0:8:48,567
l'm not gonna bark like...


150
0:8:48,567 --> 0:8:51,247
lt's your call.


151
0:8:51,247 --> 0:8:53,127
Woof.


152
0:8:53,127 --> 0:8:54,727
Good boy.


153
0:8:54,727 --> 0:8:57,887
<i>At the very least I'm gonna end today</i>
<i>on a good note,</i>


154
0:8:57,887 --> 0:8:59,727
l got something to show you.


155
0:8:59,727 --> 0:9:3,127
ls this an uncomfortable moment
that'll change our friendship?


156
0:9:3,127 --> 0:9:5,167
No, no. You're going to like it.


157
0:9:5,167 --> 0:9:8,47
Good, cos l need some good news,
man.


158
0:9:8,47 --> 0:9:12,47
Can you believe that news lady?
''What's it like to be a black doctor?''


159
0:9:12,47 --> 0:9:17,287
l just wish this was over.


160
0:9:17,287 --> 0:9:42,567
Why have we stopped?


161
0:9:42,567 --> 0:9:56,647
Roll 'em up


162
0:9:56,647 --> 0:9:58,927
Why do you think
l wanna be a part of this?


163
0:9:58,927 --> 0:10:2,447
Kelso said it would make us
role models. l just assumed...


164
0:10:2,447 --> 0:10:5,7
Everybody assumes
that l'm a good athlete,


165
0:10:5,7 --> 0:10:7,967
or that l grew up poor,
or that l love <i>Sanford and Son,</i>


166
0:10:7,967 --> 0:10:11,367
But you do love <i>Sanford And Son,</i>


167
0:10:11,367 --> 0:10:22,487
We both do.


168
0:10:22,487 --> 0:10:42,87
That's what l'm talking about.


169
0:10:42,87 --> 0:10:45,287
lf Dr Kelso wants me to be
a role model for the community


170
0:10:45,287 --> 0:10:49,7
because l'm a great doctor, great.
l will sign on the dotted line.


171
0:10:49,7 --> 0:10:51,327
But that's not what this is about.


172
0:10:51,327 --> 0:10:55,407
All my life l've been
singled out because l'm black.


173
0:10:55,407 --> 0:11:0,807
- l didn't enter the contest!
- Smile for the picture.


174
0:11:0,807 --> 0:11:4,407
- Remember our college brochure?
- They put you on the cover.


175
0:11:4,407 --> 0:11:7,487
Twice?


176
0:11:7,487 --> 0:11:25,727
lt's different this time,
now it's both of us.


177
0:11:25,727 --> 0:11:28,207
You can still see
my hand on your shoulder.


178
0:11:28,207 --> 0:11:32,367
<i>That's when I realised I'm not gonna</i>
<i>let people take advantage of me,</i>


179
0:11:32,367 --> 0:11:35,327
This is unfair.
You're supposed to do my evaluation.


180
0:11:35,327 --> 0:11:38,807
And you know what?
You're gonna do it, buddy boy.


181
0:11:38,807 --> 0:11:40,207
Buddy boy?


182
0:11:40,207 --> 0:11:42,927
Why, l oughta...


183
0:11:42,927 --> 0:11:44,967
- l'm serious.
- Relax, Newbie.


184
0:11:44,967 --> 0:11:47,727
lt's just an evaluation,
it should be easy.


185
0:11:47,727 --> 0:11:50,447
lf it's that easy,
it won't take you long to do it.


186
0:11:50,447 --> 0:11:54,807
All right, don't worry about it, Newbie.
l'll evaluate the hell right out of you.


187
0:11:54,807 --> 0:11:58,687
- When?
- The second l get off work.


188
0:11:58,687 --> 0:11:59,887
- Fine!
- Fine.


189
0:11:59,887 --> 0:12:3,767
Great! Here it is.


190
0:12:3,767 --> 0:12:14,727
- You get off, like, six-ish, or...?
- Danger.


191
0:12:14,727 --> 0:12:17,47
You're gonna have to see her eventually.


192
0:12:17,47 --> 0:12:22,367
No. l know the layout to the air-duct
system like the back of my hand.


193
0:12:22,367 --> 0:12:25,567
Of course l'm gonna
have to see her again.


194
0:12:25,567 --> 0:12:28,127
So this is the part where
it's my fault?


195
0:12:28,127 --> 0:12:31,527
Turk, if you could have seen
the look on her face...


196
0:12:31,527 --> 0:12:35,407
lf l think about it again,
it's gonna make me cry.


197
0:12:35,407 --> 0:12:37,207
What am l gonna do?


198
0:12:37,207 --> 0:12:40,887
Keep doing what you're doing.
Eventually, she'll quit and move.


199
0:12:40,887 --> 0:12:42,847
- Why am l talking to you?
- What?!


200
0:12:42,847 --> 0:12:44,287
You're such a guy.


201
0:12:44,287 --> 0:12:48,647
You can't understand something this deep
on any real emotional level.


202
0:12:48,647 --> 0:12:52,7
l'm sorry about the poster.
lt was racially insensitive.


203
0:12:52,7 --> 0:12:54,287
l should've been aware of your feelings.


204
0:12:54,287 --> 0:12:57,607
There's never been an issue of race
between us.


205
0:12:57,607 --> 0:12:59,847
You've been nothing but a friend to me.


206
0:12:59,847 --> 0:13:4,87
- l love you, man.
- Hit me one.


207
0:13:4,87 --> 0:13:5,567
Keep it real.


208
0:13:5,567 --> 0:13:10,927
We've got some things to work out
but we'll get there.


209
0:13:10,927 --> 0:13:13,887
We'll get there.


210
0:13:13,887 --> 0:13:18,567
Sure, it hurt. But you know what?
l'm not gonna wallow in self pity.


211
0:13:18,567 --> 0:13:23,167
Right after work, l'm gonna go downtown
and just tear it up.


212
0:13:23,167 --> 0:13:26,447
Maybe l'll have a cigarette,
just get a little crazy,


213
0:13:26,447 --> 0:13:31,687
and head wherever the night takes me.


214
0:13:31,687 --> 0:13:40,687
What's that, now?


215
0:13:40,687 --> 0:13:56,247
Thanks so much!


216
0:13:56,247 --> 0:13:57,407
Taxi!


217
0:13:57,407 --> 0:13:59,607
Hey, baby, how much?


218
0:13:59,607 --> 0:14:1,967
Hey, don't go away, man!


219
0:14:1,967 --> 0:14:9,167
Get me the hell outta here. Hurry!


220
0:14:9,167 --> 0:14:11,127
Here's what we're gonna do.


221
0:14:11,127 --> 0:14:15,87
l'm gonna leave the cart in the closet
and leave the closet unlocked.


222
0:14:15,87 --> 0:14:20,167
lf, by magic, it should happen to
reappear, l won't ask any questions.


223
0:14:20,167 --> 0:14:22,647
l don't even know what ''it'' is.


224
0:14:22,647 --> 0:14:27,407
Then why take it?


225
0:14:27,407 --> 0:14:32,407
Well, if it isn't Dr Turk,
the friendly face of Sacred Heart.


226
0:14:32,407 --> 0:14:33,767
Yeah.


227
0:14:33,767 --> 0:14:38,727
Dr Kelso, about these posters...
They're making me uncomfortable.


228
0:14:38,727 --> 0:14:43,367
l'm so sorry.
l didn't realise you felt that way.


229
0:14:43,367 --> 0:14:47,287
Well, here's what l'm gonna do...
l'm gonna leave them up.


230
0:14:47,287 --> 0:14:54,367
l can live with that. Or l can sue you.


231
0:14:54,367 --> 0:15:0,527
Dr Turk, you are an employee here.
l can advertise however l wish.


232
0:15:0,527 --> 0:15:3,207
l can use your image, your name,


233
0:15:3,207 --> 0:15:6,647
l can manufacture
tiny little Dr Turk action figures.


234
0:15:6,647 --> 0:15:9,607
lt'll cost $1 2.95.
When you pull the string, it says:


235
0:15:9,607 --> 0:15:11,607
''l don't like these posters!''


236
0:15:11,607 --> 0:15:14,87
- lsn't that right, Ted?
- Definitely, sir.


237
0:15:14,87 --> 0:15:17,527
You'd certainly be vulnerable
from a legal standpoint.


238
0:15:17,527 --> 0:15:19,47
How vulnerable?


239
0:15:19,47 --> 0:15:23,567
That lawsuit would be over so quickly,
bring cab fare to the courthouse,


240
0:15:23,567 --> 0:15:29,367
since Dr Turk will be driving
your Beamer home to his place.


241
0:15:29,367 --> 0:15:32,487
Hippie.


242
0:15:32,487 --> 0:15:34,727
God, that felt good.


243
0:15:34,727 --> 0:15:37,167
Who's the man?


244
0:15:37,167 --> 0:15:42,887
- ls it me?
- Damn right it's you.


245
0:15:42,887 --> 0:15:46,287
Right, man.


246
0:15:46,287 --> 0:16:0,567
lt's me.


247
0:16:0,567 --> 0:16:4,207
Elliot...
There's no excuse for what l did.


248
0:16:4,207 --> 0:16:8,247
No, there's not.


249
0:16:8,247 --> 0:16:11,527
- Are we done?
- l'm really sorry.


250
0:16:11,527 --> 0:16:17,487
Don't be. lf l was going out
with my friend l wouldn't invite you.


251
0:16:17,487 --> 0:16:22,567
Yes, l would. She'd like you better and
neither of you would talk to me again.


252
0:16:22,567 --> 0:16:26,127
l only did it because l hadn't
seen Patricia in a long time.


253
0:16:26,127 --> 0:16:29,7
You did it cos l don't fit in
with you and your friend.


254
0:16:29,7 --> 0:16:33,527
lt's no surprise. lt's not like
l've ever fit in anywhere.


255
0:16:33,527 --> 0:16:41,927
Carla, your friend Patricia's here.
There's a problem with her son.


256
0:16:41,927 --> 0:16:45,567
Why so sad, Marshmallow?


257
0:16:45,567 --> 0:16:49,127
<i>Stay calm</i>
<i>stay calm stay calm,</i>


258
0:16:49,127 --> 0:16:52,727
<i>Oh good, He's not here,</i>


259
0:16:52,727 --> 0:16:57,127
Dr Cox?


260
0:16:57,127 --> 0:17:1,807
lt's time. Sit down.


261
0:17:1,807 --> 0:17:5,247
What do you want me to say?
That you're great?


262
0:17:5,247 --> 0:17:8,327
That you're raising the bar
for interns everywhere?


263
0:17:8,327 --> 0:17:10,727
l'm cool with that.


264
0:17:10,727 --> 0:17:13,607
l'm not gonna say that. You're OK.


265
0:17:13,607 --> 0:17:16,647
You might be better than that some day
but now all l see is


266
0:17:16,647 --> 0:17:19,407
a guy worried about
what everybody thinks of him


267
0:17:19,407 --> 0:17:21,487
that he has no real belief in himself.


268
0:17:21,487 --> 0:17:28,527
l mean, did you even wonder why
l told you to do your own evaluation?


269
0:17:28,527 --> 0:17:30,887
l can't think of a safe answer,
l just...


270
0:17:30,887 --> 0:17:32,327
Clam up!


271
0:17:32,327 --> 0:17:35,7
l wanted you to think about yourself.


272
0:17:35,7 --> 0:17:37,967
And l mean really think.


273
0:17:37,967 --> 0:17:41,847
What are you good at? What do you
suck at? l wanted it down on paper,


274
0:17:41,847 --> 0:17:46,327
not so l could see it, or anybody else,
but so that you could see it.


275
0:17:46,327 --> 0:17:49,447
Ultimately, you don't have
to answer to me, or to Kelso,


276
0:17:49,447 --> 0:17:52,847
you don't even have to answer
to your patients, for God's sake.


277
0:17:52,847 --> 0:18:0,607
You only have to answer to
one guy, Newbie, and that's you!


278
0:18:0,607 --> 0:18:2,487
There...


279
0:18:2,487 --> 0:18:9,527
You are... evaluated.


280
0:18:9,527 --> 0:18:11,567
Get the hell outta my sight.


281
0:18:11,567 --> 0:18:20,167
You, honest to God, get me so angry
l'm afraid l might hurt myself.


282
0:18:20,167 --> 0:18:22,487
So what are you?
One of the male nurses?


283
0:18:22,487 --> 0:18:26,247
Actually, l'm a surgeon.
l'm doing this as a favour for Carla.


284
0:18:26,247 --> 0:18:29,767
Carla is fine.
What's she doing with you?


285
0:18:29,767 --> 0:18:32,327
Slummin' a little, God bless her heart.


286
0:18:32,327 --> 0:18:34,607
This is a knife cut, huh?


287
0:18:34,607 --> 0:18:36,567
Yeah, it's cool.


288
0:18:36,567 --> 0:18:41,287
See this right here?
Pinched it in a door. Two stitches.


289
0:18:41,287 --> 0:18:45,367
- Oh, man. You hardcore, man.
- Hell, yeah!


290
0:18:45,367 --> 0:18:48,127
Darryl's gonna be fine
but l'm worried about you.


291
0:18:48,127 --> 0:18:51,927
You're upset. l'll set you up
in a room with some fluids and a Valium.


292
0:18:51,927 --> 0:18:55,47
- Elliot, thank you.
- There you are.


293
0:18:55,47 --> 0:18:57,207
Elliot, you're coming, right?


294
0:18:57,207 --> 0:19:0,407
- ln a sec.
- Are you all right?


295
0:19:0,407 --> 0:19:3,7
<i>It's funny how our perceptions</i>
<i>can be so off,</i>


296
0:19:3,7 --> 0:19:5,487
Hot cocoa, sweetie?


297
0:19:5,487 --> 0:19:7,807
Thanks.


298
0:19:7,807 --> 0:19:9,287
Anytime.


299
0:19:9,287 --> 0:19:11,887
<i>Like when you're searching</i>
<i>for a place to fit in</i>


300
0:19:11,887 --> 0:19:18,327
<i>and you don't realise you've</i>
<i>been there the whole time,</i>


301
0:19:18,327 --> 0:19:26,327
<i>Or how posters can't turn you into a</i>
<i>role model if you've been one for years,</i>


302
0:19:26,327 --> 0:19:30,327
<i>Of course in my case</i>
<i>I knew exactly where I stood,</i>


303
0:19:30,327 --> 0:19:32,367
<i>And it didn't feel that good,</i>


304
0:19:32,367 --> 0:19:36,287
l would like to make
special mention of one intern here,


305
0:19:36,287 --> 0:19:37,927
John Dorian.


306
0:19:37,927 --> 0:19:41,447
Smart kid, extremely competent,
and his enthusiasm


307
0:19:41,447 --> 0:19:43,807
and his determination
to always be better


308
0:19:43,807 --> 0:19:47,87
is something l see in him
24 hours a day.


309
0:19:47,87 --> 0:19:49,887
He cares. Probably cares too much.


310
0:19:49,887 --> 0:19:53,287
But he's definitely somebody
you don't want to lose.


311
0:19:53,287 --> 0:19:56,807
lf you have any questions...
l could give a crap, l'm goin' home.


312
0:19:56,807 --> 0:19:59,647
You all get paid too much
for doing nothing.


313
0:19:59,647 --> 0:20:2,807
Oh, good, Newbie. You found a specialty.


314
0:20:2,807 --> 0:20:5,247
No, l just dropped my pen.


315
0:20:5,247 --> 0:20:9,47
Well, look what magically
found its way back home.


316
0:20:9,47 --> 0:20:11,367
What? Your window cleaner?


317
0:20:11,367 --> 0:20:13,807
No. Ammonia.


318
0:20:13,807 --> 0:20:22,127
This is window cleaner, right...


319
0:20:22,127 --> 0:20:24,567
Why?


320
0:20:24,567 --> 0:22:24,567
<i>Now that's just bad luck,</i>
