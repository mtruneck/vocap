0:0:3,909 --> 0:0:8,959
Word up Food Tubers! Ok we've got some really
exciting news because my dear friend, and


2
0:0:8,959 --> 0:0:12,87
someone that I admire greatly, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall
and all the guys River Cottage


3
0:0:12,87 --> 0:0:16,9
The whole River Cottage gang
Is gonna join the Food Tube family.


4
0:0:16,9 --> 0:0:18,4
You're gonna have your own channel.
We are, if that's alright with you Jamie?!


5
0:0:18,4 --> 0:0:21,68
Mate, this is brilliant. What's the first
dish gonna be, that's the question. Well I


6
0:0:21,68 --> 0:0:26,84
wanna cook you a lovely sausage and prune casserole.
And I do love that little bit of sweetness


7
0:0:26,84 --> 0:0:30,88
from the prunes, it goes brilliantly with
a spicy banger. One of those big winter


8
0:0:30,88 --> 0:0:35,17
warmers. The kind of dish that gives you a
hug from the inside.


9
0:0:35,17 --> 0:0:38,79
So I'm gonna start browning some of these
amazing sausages.


10
0:0:38,79 --> 0:0:41,37
Lovely
This is where you wanna choose your biggest,


11
0:0:41,37 --> 0:0:45,41
best seasoned butchers banger. You know the
one with loads of herbs and a little bit of


12
0:0:45,41 --> 0:0:50,26
spice too. This is actually gonna be a long,
slow cook and all the sausagey flavours are


13
0:0:50,26 --> 0:0:54,51
gonna mingle with all the other ingredients.
So I can see in the pan there you've got onions


14
0:0:54,51 --> 0:0:58,42
sweetening up and getting gorgeous.
Yes silky, sweated onions for the start. Then


15
0:0:58,42 --> 0:1:2,449
we're just building up the flavours. So Jamie
I'd love some celery and I'm gonna peel a


16
0:1:2,449 --> 0:1:7,47
couple of carrots. Because this is pretty close
to being a one pot wonder, it's all gonna


17
0:1:7,47 --> 0:1:9,91
end up in there.
What size do you want your celery?


18
0:1:9,91 --> 0:1:12,5
Exactly that size.
Thank God for that.


19
0:1:12,5 --> 0:1:14,64
Everything quite chunky because it's gonna
have a long time in the pot.


20
0:1:14,64 --> 0:1:18,25
That can go in, yeah.
Back in the day, rather than big chunks of


21
0:1:18,25 --> 0:1:21,39
sausage, it might be a couple of pig's trotters
going in.


22
0:1:21,39 --> 0:1:23,86
Right.
You know, or a bit of Ox tail. Anything that


23
0:1:23,86 --> 0:1:28,349
was to hand that was gonna add a little bit
of extra flavour and body to the rest of the


24
0:1:28,349 --> 0:1:33,64
dish.
Look at that! You see that colour equals flavour.


25
0:1:33,64 --> 0:1:39,58
There is now a flavour that did not exist
before. That's the caramelisation of the meat


26
0:1:39,58 --> 0:1:44,72
and the surface of the sausage.
Tell them about the River Cottage channel.


27
0:1:44,72 --> 0:1:50,38
I'm so lucky to be surrounded by people with
such passion. You know we've got Craig in


28
0:1:50,38 --> 0:1:56,66
the garden growing fabulous veg. He's absolutely
bursting with fantastic tips. John our mushroom


29
0:1:56,66 --> 0:2:1,539
man and Gill, my head chef has always got
some witty new dish up his sleeve.


30
0:2:1,539 --> 0:2:5,78
Pam the Jam you know, I just want to capture
a bit more of what everybody is up to.


31
0:2:5,78 --> 0:2:7,64
And get it on your channel?!
Exactly right.


32
0:2:7,64 --> 0:2:11,78
And you guys watching now, throw in some comments
to Huw. Tell him what you want to see. From


33
0:2:11,78 --> 0:2:17,39
growing to the pickling, smoking, all the
crafts around food. Him and his network, ask


34
0:2:17,39 --> 0:2:20,7
him what you want!
So let's have a look in this pan. Basically


35
0:2:20,7 --> 0:2:23,53
onions, celery, carrots. In go the bangers.
Beautiful.


36
0:2:23,53 --> 0:2:28,21
And in goes everything else now. Some of these
lentils you can use brown ones but you want


37
0:2:28,21 --> 0:2:32,97
a lentil with a skin on it. Not like the orange
ones that turn to mush. They're gonna hold


38
0:2:32,97 --> 0:2:36,68
their shape. So I reckon about maybe a third
of a pack.


39
0:2:36,68 --> 0:2:40,69
Ok so about what? 40g per person?
Something like that, yeah, yeah.


40
0:2:40,69 --> 0:2:43,4
So, plenty of lentils in there and then the
stock.


41
0:2:43,4 --> 0:2:47,16
So chicken stock but you can use a veg stock.
Because this is gonna serve how many people?


42
0:2:47,16 --> 0:2:50,73
4?
You know, 4-6. But 4 will be very generously


43
0:2:50,73 --> 0:2:56,29
fed here. We want just enough stock to almost
cover. We should definitely get a couple of


44
0:2:56,29 --> 0:3:0,8
Bay Leaves in there and the prunes can go
in now. This is a lovely explosion of sweetness


45
0:3:0,8 --> 0:3:5,4
and fruitiness dotted through the stew.
And by the time it's done, the prune will taste


46
0:3:5,4 --> 0:3:8,94
of sausage, the sausage will taste of prune,
the vegetable flavours will be everywhere


47
0:3:8,94 --> 0:3:11,37
and it'll be just absolutely packed with flavour.
Mmm gorgeous.


48
0:3:11,37 --> 0:3:15,69
It's just coming up to a bubble which is the
moment you want to put it in the oven, 140°C


49
0:3:15,69 --> 0:3:18,24
for an hour and a quarter.
Ok so I'll put that in the oven for you Hugh.


50
0:3:18,24 --> 0:3:23,35
140°C for how long?
An hour and a quarter.


51
0:3:23,35 --> 0:3:27,569
You can see how it's all reduced down into
this rich stew.


52
0:3:27,569 --> 0:3:31,709
And the colour! It's just gone so dark and
wintery and beautiful.


53
0:3:31,709 --> 0:3:35,27
Let's just put a little bit of spinach in
the pan because a splash of lightly cooked


54
0:3:35,27 --> 0:3:37,66
greens just adds a bit of zing on the edge
of the plate.


55
0:3:37,66 --> 0:3:41,3
Also, I've used that sausage pan
That'll pick up some of those lovely flavours


56
0:3:41,3 --> 0:3:42,63
won't it.
I'm just gonna braise it. A little bit of


57
0:3:42,63 --> 0:3:45,87
salt and nutmeg?
Yeah perfect. Always a good idea.


58
0:3:45,87 --> 0:3:48,4
It's like the food that you dream of when
it's cold.


59
0:3:48,4 --> 0:3:53,319
That spinach looks very nearly ready Jamie,
I'm gonna get a sausage out there.


60
0:3:53,319 --> 0:3:58,459
Just look at that!
How about that?! I'm just gonna put one on


61
0:3:58,459 --> 0:4:2,76
this plate, bit of carrot there, bit of prune,
lots of lovely lentils. Nice big spray of


62
0:4:2,76 --> 0:4:6,44
spinach. It's really kind of rustic, peasant
food isn't it. It's the kind of thing that


63
0:4:6,44 --> 0:4:11,6
the Italians wouldn't think twice about knocking
together but we've done it with lovely bangers,


64
0:4:11,6 --> 0:4:17,8
carrots from the garden.
Go on, get stuck in!


65
0:4:17,8 --> 0:4:25,7
Oh my goodness! Isn't it just melty.
The depth of flavour is phenomenal! You have


66
0:4:25,7 --> 0:4:28,6
to try that recipe. It's so good! Proper comfort
food.


67
0:4:28,6 --> 0:4:30,56
Hugh, thank you very much.
Great to be here.


68
0:4:30,56 --> 0:4:35,25
