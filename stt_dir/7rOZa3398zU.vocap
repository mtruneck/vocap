###13 ROCCO CASTORO: Hi, I'm Rocco, and today we're in Venice
###15 Beach at the Rose Cafe, which is a favorite
###19 eatery of Rob Delaney.
###21 He's a very funny comedian and what some have termed the King
###24 of Twitter.
###25 He writes a column for us at Vice on the website.
###28 And today we're going to have breakfast with him and chat
###31 about eating vaginas, Rick Santorum, hairiness, and all
###35 sorts of other fun stuff.
###37 
###42 ROCCO CASTORO: I'm hear on a lovely Wednesday morning with
###45 the lovely Rob Delaney.
###47 ROB DELANEY: Hello.
###47 ROCCO CASTORO: The first thing you did for us and how this
###50 relationship started was a piece in our Larfs issue a
###54 couple years back.
###56 And the piece was called "Comedy."
###58 ROB DELANEY: It was.
###58 ROCCO CASTORO: It actually opened the issue.
###60 ROB DELANEY: Yeah, well, I had been approached by your
###64 magazine to write for them anything I wanted,
###67 essentially, about comedy.
###69 And I remember lamenting that most magazines, when they do a
###75 comedy issue, it's usually really awful and unfunny.
###80 So I really just tried to sort of plumb my depths, so to
###85 speak, psychologically and just talk about my motivations
###88 for doing comedy, what I think is funny, what's not funny,
###90 why it might be funny, what sort of drives me.
###93 Because I like comedians.
###95 I like it other comedians.
###96 And I like fans of comedy.
###97 And I wanted to give them something like this that would
###101 hopefully nourish them.
###102 I wanted them to have the sandwich.
###106 ROCCO CASTORO: The subject matter of that article--
###109 sort of lay of the land at that point in your life, what
###112 you're doing.
###113 And you told me earlier that you were--
###116 I don't know if you were at the time, but right around
###117 then working at a call center but also doing comedy, and
###120 this was a year and a half ago.
###123 But you also talked a little bit about what happened to you
###125 10 years ago, which you can say much better than I can.
###130 ROB DELANEY: Yeah, well.
###131 Yeah, first, I'll say you're right.
###133 I'm very lucky right now to be making a living doing comedy,
###138 but it was just 10 years ago that I was in a big car
###142 accident that prompted me to quit drinking.
###145 But yeah, I drove into a building in LA and broke both
###150 my arms and was in jail in a wheelchair.
###153 And it was then that I was like, oh, if I keep drinking,
###157 it'll kill other people.
###159 And I didn't want to kill other people.
###161 I don't like to kill people.
###163 Sorry, guys.
###164 So after I kind of physically got better from that accident,
###169 I said, oh, I'm a comedian now.
###172 ROCCO CASTORO: So do you remember the first time that
###174 you found out what Twitter was?
###177 ROB DELANEY: Well, the first time I heard what it was, I
###180 think I was at a comedy show and somebody mentioned it.
###184 I'd heard about it maybe on the news or something.
###187 And it sounded very unappealing.
###189 Why?
###189 Who cares?
###191 I was on Facebook and Louis CK had said that
###193 he had joined Twitter.
###196 And I thought, well, maybe--
###198 he usually does things that I think are funny and
###201 intelligent.
###201 I should check it out.
###202 So I did.
###203 And what I tried to do was just post jokes rather than,
###209 like, I ate this.
###211 ROCCO CASTORO: So where did your Twitter--
###214 picture?
###214 I don't know if it's an avatar?
###215 You're in Speedos.
###217 ROB DELANEY: Yeah.
###217 I am wearing a Speedo bathing suit.
###219 And that is a bathing suit that I do genuinely own,
###223 because I live very close to the beach.
###225 So if I go swimming in the winter, I will wear that
###228 'cause it just makes more sense under a wetsuit.
###230 So I totally am aware of the fact that it's a disgusting
###234 look on a hairy large person.
###237 But basically, I was getting ready to go swimming at night
###240 with my wife, and my friend John was there, and I took off
###243 my clothes and had the Speedo, and he's like, Jesus.
###247 He took a picture.
###248 And then when I first signed up for Twitter, I thought, oh,
###250 this is so stupid, I'll put the worst picture of
###252 me that I have up.
###253 And that's it.
###255 And then after a while, people were like, you
###257 gotta rid of that.
###258 And I was like, no, I'll never.
###261 ROCCO CASTORO: And your last--
###263 well, we'll say your last two tweets.
###264 Pepsi's Twitter account said, The best place to
###267 hide a Pepsi is blank.
###270 And Rob responded, in a cop's asshole.
###274 Nothing aga-- cops--
###275 we need 'em.
###275 I like 'em.
###276 But the word "cop," it's (ENUNCIATING) cop.
###279 So I've always taught cop was a funny word.
###281 I have words that I just think are funny, just
###284 the sound of them.
###285 ROCCO CASTORO: Phonetically?
###286 ROB DELANEY: Yeah, like cop--
###287 ROCCO CASTORO: Cock?
###288 ROB DELANEY: Ham.
###289 Cock is a funny word.
###290 I love the word ham.
###291 Beef.
###292 A lot of meat-related words.
###294 So cop, cop's just such a nice word.
###297 And anyway, so, and then asshole, that just always
###299 makes me laugh.
###300 ROCCO CASTORO: OK.
###301 And your tweet before is, Virginia is for lovers, and
###306 then in parentheses, of psychotic--
###308 in all caps--
###309 abortion bills.
###311 So why did you tweet that?
###313 ROB DELANEY: There are right now in Virginia some lawmakers
###315 who have drafted a bill that would require women who wanted
###318 to get an abortion to get an ultrasound.
###321 Now what is a big part of this is that when a woman is in the
###328 early stages of pregnancy, the fetus is super tiny.
###331 So they can't use an over-the-belly ultrasound.
###333 They actually have to put a probe up her vagina to do the
###338 ultrasound.
###339 And it's a big fucking wand.
###342 It's like bigger than, like, three of my dicks.
###345 And they're putting it up.
###347 And that--
###347 so it's like robot rape.
###350 It's beyond--
###352 I mean, that's psychological torture.
###354 It's physical torture.
###355 It's unbelievable and fundamentally wrong.
###360 ROCCO CASTORO: One thing you really like to talk about is
###362 women, in a way that I think is positive
###365 but also very honest.
###368 ROB DELANEY: I do like to take a more, I don't know,
###373 proletariat approach to like sexuality, of like a
###377 blue-collar, sweaty, fun approach to sex.
###386 And I genuinely really feel the things that
###390 I tweet about that.
###393 Like, I don't like it when women shave
###395 off their pubic hair.
###398 That is a legitimate thing that I feel.
###399 That's weird to me.
###402 And maybe it's because I'm a man and it's easier for me to
###404 see, like it's easier for me to be an other and see, like,
###408 oh, I see this thing that's happening to this group of
###410 people, which represents more than half of our planet's
###412 population, and it's so fucking wrong that I'm going
###416 to do my little bit that I possibly can to try and help.
###419 So women usually, the overwhelming majority, are
###422 funny and nice.
###423 And they'll probably write a zinger back to me that's
###425 funnier than what I wrote.
###427 ROCCO CASTORO: You've had quite a few tweets and columns
###431 about the current Republican candidates.
###434 Who would you say is the best to make fun of?
###436 ROB DELANEY: Probably Rick Santorum, because he's the
###443 antipodes of how I feel about many things.
###447 I feel like his policies, if enacted, would hurt people.
###452 I feel that he would have a really negative effect.
###455 So if there's something I see that I think is having a
###457 negative effect, I'm going to use comedy to present my ideas
###462 and to eviscerate the ones that I don't like.
###466 ROCCO CASTORO: When was there a--
###467 we'll call it an exponential
###470 explosion of Twitter followers?
###471 When did you hit a marker where you're like, wow, I have
###475 50,000 people following me on Twitter.
###477 ROB DELANEY: Getting to 100,000 followers took what
###480 felt like forever.
###480 Going from 100,000 to 200,000 was like [SNAP].
###483 Going from 200,000 to 300,000 was like, oh, it happened.
###486 It's crazy.
###487 So the speed that you accumulate them gets faster.
###490 But the big thing for me was after years of submitting
###496 packets to late night comedy shows, and being told, like,
###499 oh, this is terrific, but not getting hired, I at the same
###503 time got hired by Graham Linehan to work on story ideas
###508 for the fifth season of the British show The IT Crowd.
###513 And also I got hired by MTV to write for a Rob Dyrdek show
###518 called Ridiculousness.
###520 So those two things happened at the same time.
###523 And Vice Magazine said, hey, want to
###525 write this comedy article?
###526 ROCCO CASTORO: Some of the most popular pieces you've
###528 written for us, and I would imagine tweets as well, have
###532 concerned the nature of celebrity.
###535 Specifically, a piece you wrote about suing Kim
###538 Kardashian after her divorce.
###541 ROB DELANEY: Yes.
###542 ROCCO CASTORO: How would serious were you?
###545 ROB DELANEY: Uh, 100% about the feelings behind it.
###551 I think that what she did was wrong.
###552 We know it was fake from the outset.
###554 So I just wanted to say, no, young lady, and Ryan Seacrest,
###558 and E Entertainment Television, and Comcast, who
###561 were also named in the lawsuit.
###563 ROCCO CASTORO: You're also writing a book.
###565 ROB DELANEY: I'm writing a book.
###566 Yes.
###567 The book has nothing to do Twitter.
###570 It's a memoir/novel type thing.
###573 Since I am a relatively young person, I understand that
###577 people wouldn't want to read a book about just my life.
###580 I wouldn't want to write that.
###581 So I am trying to--
###584 I'm filtering it through the cheese grater of my
###587 joke-writing-trained mind to make sure that it is
###590 entertaining.
###591 Because as a comedian, it's my job that everything that I do
###596 be funny, and at the very least compelling
###600 and pull you along.
###601
