0:0:13,821 --> 0:0:18,115
One of the most striking properties about life is that it has color.


2
0:0:18,115 --> 0:0:22,44
To understand the phenomenon of color, it helps to think about light as a wave.


3
0:0:22,44 --> 0:0:24,545
But, before we get to that,


4
0:0:24,545 --> 0:0:27,546
let's talk a little bit about waves in general.


5
0:0:27,546 --> 0:0:33,85
Imagine you're sitting on a boat on the ocean watching a cork bob up and down in the water.


6
0:0:33,85 --> 0:0:36,279
The first thing you notice about the motion is that it repeats itself.


7
0:0:36,279 --> 0:0:41,93
The cork traces the same path over and over again... up and down, up and down.


8
0:0:41,93 --> 0:0:47,0
This repetitive or periodic motion is characteristic of waves.


9
0:0:47,0 --> 0:0:48,43
Then you notice something else...


10
0:0:48,43 --> 0:0:51,917
using a stopwatch, you measure the time it takes for the piece of cork


11
0:0:51,917 --> 0:0:56,381
to go over its highest position down to its lowest and then  back up again.


12
0:0:56,381 --> 0:0:58,234
Suppose this takes two seconds.


13
0:0:58,234 --> 0:1:2,746
To use the physics jargon, you've measured the period of the waves that cork is bobbing on.


14
0:1:2,746 --> 0:1:6,613
That is, how long it takes a wave to go through its full range of motion once.


15
0:1:6,613 --> 0:1:12,53
The same information can be expressed in a different way by calculating the wave's frequency.


16
0:1:12,53 --> 0:1:16,683
Frequency, as the name suggest, tells you how frequent the waves are.


17
0:1:16,683 --> 0:1:19,746
That is, how many of them go by in one second.


18
0:1:19,746 --> 0:1:22,631
If you know how many seconds one full wave takes,


19
0:1:22,631 --> 0:1:26,188
then it's easy to work out how many waves go by in one second.


20
0:1:26,188 --> 0:1:32,653
In this case, since each wave takes 2 seconds, the frequency is 0.5 waves per second.


21
0:1:32,653 --> 0:1:36,515
So enough about bobbing corks... what about light and color?


22
0:1:36,515 --> 0:1:39,229
If light is a wave, then it must have a frequency. Right?


23
0:1:39,229 --> 0:1:40,942
Well... yes, it does.


24
0:1:40,942 --> 0:1:45,288
And it turns out that we already have a name for the frequency of the light that our eyes detect.


25
0:1:45,288 --> 0:1:46,982
It's called color.


26
0:1:46,982 --> 0:1:51,396
That's right. Color is nothing more than a measure of how quickly the light waves are waving.


27
0:1:51,396 --> 0:1:55,731
If our eyes were quick enough, we might be able to observe this periodic motion directly,


28
0:1:55,731 --> 0:1:57,897
like we can with the cork and the ocean.


29
0:1:57,897 --> 0:2:0,161
But the frequency of the light we see is so high,


30
0:2:0,161 --> 0:2:4,387
it waves up and down about 400 million million times a second,


31
0:2:4,387 --> 0:2:10,814
that we can't possibly see it as a wave. But we can tell, by looking at its color, what its frequency is.


32
0:2:10,814 --> 0:2:14,975
The lowest frequency light that we can see is red and the highest frequency is purple.


33
0:2:14,975 --> 0:2:20,914
In between all the other frequencies form a continous band of color, called the visible spectrum.


34
0:2:20,914 --> 0:2:24,139
So, what if you had a yellow pencil sitting on your desk?


35
0:2:24,139 --> 0:2:29,151
Well, the sun emits all colors of light, so light of all colors is hitting your pencil.


36
0:2:29,151 --> 0:2:34,79
The pencil looks yellow because it reflects yellow light more than it reflects the other colors.


37
0:2:34,79 --> 0:2:36,665
What happens to the blue, purple and red light?


38
0:2:36,665 --> 0:2:40,766
They get absorbed and the energy they are carrying is turned into heat.


39
0:2:40,766 --> 0:2:42,847
It is similar with objects of other colors.


40
0:2:42,847 --> 0:2:46,606
Blue things reflect blue light, red things reflect red light and so on.


41
0:2:46,606 --> 0:2:48,867
White objects reflect all colors of light,


42
0:2:48,867 --> 0:2:52,945
while black things do exactly the opposite and absorb at all frequencies.


43
0:2:52,945 --> 0:4:52,945
This - by the way - is why it's uncomfortable to wear your favorite Metallica t-shirt on a sunny day.
