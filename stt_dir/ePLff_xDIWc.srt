CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Jumping right in today
with something that hasn`t happened in nearly


2
0:0:16,84 --> 0:0:23,3
600 years: the pope is resigning. Pope Benedict
XVI made the announcement yesterday. He said


3
0:0:23,3 --> 0:0:29,4
the reason is his "advanced age". He`ll turn
86 in April. He will officially resign at


4
0:0:29,4 --> 0:0:34,1
the end of this month. There are three parts
of the story we want to look at. First, popes


5
0:0:34,1 --> 0:0:38,85
in general. The title comes from the Latin
word for father, and the tradition goes back


6
0:0:38,85 --> 0:0:45,79
nearly 2,000 years. In that time, there have
been 265 popes. Christianity is the world`s


7
0:0:45,79 --> 0:0:49,739
largest religion. Roman Catholics are the
largest group of Christians, and the pope


8
0:0:49,739 --> 0:0:53,839
is the head of the Roman Catholic Church.
So, the person who holds this title, is a


9
0:0:53,839 --> 0:0:58,23
major religious leader. He is also a world
leader. The pope is the head of state for


10
0:0:58,23 --> 0:1:1,319
Vatican City, the world`s smallest country.


11
0:1:1,319 --> 0:1:7,63
Second, who is this pope? Who is Benedict
XVI? His birth name is Joseph Ratzinger. When


12
0:1:7,63 --> 0:1:12,5
someone is elected a new pope, he traditionally
chooses a new name. Cardinal Ratzinger picked


13
0:1:12,5 --> 0:1:19,36
Benedict. He was born in Germany in 1927,
became a priest in 1951, was made a cardinal


14
0:1:19,36 --> 0:1:26,38
in 1977, and in 2005 he was elected pope.
He`ll stop being pope in February, 28th, at


15
0:1:26,38 --> 0:1:28,85
8 p.m. local time in Rome.


16
0:1:28,85 --> 0:1:34,2
So, what happens next? The college of cardinals,
leaders in the Catholic Church will get together


17
0:1:34,2 --> 0:1:38,28
for something called a conclave -- that`s
where they all elect a new pope. They each


18
0:1:38,28 --> 0:1:43,58
cast ballots, and if someone gets two thirds
of the vote, plus one more that person becomes


19
0:1:43,58 --> 0:1:48,62
the new pope. If no one gets that many votes
the first time, then the cardinals vote again.


20
0:1:48,62 --> 0:1:53,93
A spokesman from the Vatican said the elections
would probably be sometime in March. He expected


21
0:1:53,93 --> 0:1:55,63
there to be a new pope by Easter.


22
0:1:55,63 --> 0:1:56,13
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


23
0:1:56,13 --> 0:2:0,96
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s a report
card and it`s a prognostication. It is the


24
0:2:0,96 --> 0:2:9,44
president saying, this is what I would like
to do in the coming year.


25
0:2:9,44 --> 0:2:13,84
The State of the Union is essentially a homework
assignment from the framers of the Constitution


26
0:2:13,84 --> 0:2:19,79
to every president who`s lived ever since.
The Constitution tells them that they periodically


27
0:2:19,79 --> 0:2:25,4
must tell Congress how the country is doing.
If a president wants to lean hard to one side


28
0:2:25,4 --> 0:2:30,54
or hard to the other side, then you might
see more political purpose in the State of


29
0:2:30,54 --> 0:2:39,0
the Union, although often it`s just a general
sense of let`s move this direction.


30
0:2:39,0 --> 0:2:43,47
The whole thing is a huge pageant. The president
comes walking in, escorted by members of the


31
0:2:43,47 --> 0:2:48,59
House and Senate, the Sergeant of Arms announces
him and everybody stands, and cheers. And


32
0:2:48,59 --> 0:2:52,85
there`s quite a crowd there. Everyone has
assigned seating, right behind the president


33
0:2:52,85 --> 0:2:57,37
you will find the speaker of the U.S. House
of Representatives, and the President of the


34
0:2:57,37 --> 0:3:0,98
Senate, which will be the vice president of
the United States, and then the two parties


35
0:3:0,98 --> 0:3:6,91
generally, generally stay on their side of
the isle, although recently they started sitting


36
0:3:6,91 --> 0:3:11,81
with each other to suggest that they can get
along a little bit better than most of us


37
0:3:11,81 --> 0:3:16,2
think. You typically have the Supreme Court
there, the joint chiefs of staff. They are


38
0:3:16,2 --> 0:3:21,8
representing the military, and the First Lady
will also be there, usually with some sort


39
0:3:21,8 --> 0:3:29,569
of special guest, in recent years. That will
illustrate some point the president is making.


40
0:3:29,569 --> 0:3:36,209
One of the coolest parts of the presidential
address is always the missing cabinet member


41
0:3:36,209 --> 0:3:41,239
and fearing out who it`s going to be. One
member of the cabinet always has to be somewhere


42
0:3:41,239 --> 0:3:45,79
else, in case something terrible happened,
so presumably, you could have the secretary


43
0:3:45,79 --> 0:3:49,88
of agriculture sitting somewhere thinking
about hog futures, and suddenly he is the


44
0:3:49,88 --> 0:3:57,38
president of the United States, which would
be a huge shock to him.


45
0:3:57,38 --> 0:4:3,8
Since the 1960s, the opposition has also issued
a response. That is someone selected by the


46
0:4:3,8 --> 0:4:8,61
opposing party to stand up and refute what
the president said or say, perhaps, we have


47
0:4:8,61 --> 0:4:12,69
different ideas about how the government should
be conducting itself and where we should be


48
0:4:12,69 --> 0:4:14,23
going in the coming year.

AZUZ: The State of the Union speech is tonight.
Special coverage starts on CNN at 7 p.m. Eastern,


51
0:4:23,39 --> 0:4:27,569
the president speech will start at 9. And
the Republican response will be after he finishes.


52
0:4:27,569 --> 0:4:32,169
Before we hear what the president has to say,
we`d like to hear what you would like him


53
0:4:32,169 --> 0:4:37,15
to say. Tell us on our blog today at cnnstudentnews.com


54
0:4:37,15 --> 0:4:41,46
Our next, we want you to check out the storm
chaser video we shot Sunday in Hattiesburg,


55
0:4:41,46 --> 0:4:47,24
Mississippi. The state was hit by several
storms, and look at this tornado. Part of


56
0:4:47,24 --> 0:4:51,87
the severe weather. The storm chasers pull
up to the area that the tornado just ripped


57
0:4:51,87 --> 0:4:57,6
across. You can actually see some of the damage
that it had just left behind. The Hattiesburg


58
0:4:57,6 --> 0:5:3,5
mayor said one good thing is that this twister
hit on a Sunday, which meant most of the buildings


59
0:5:3,5 --> 0:5:7,57
that were damaged were empty. We`ve got a
video that explains how tornadoes form, where


60
0:5:7,57 --> 0:5:11,29
they are most likely to show up. You could
check that out in the resources box on our


61

62
0:5:12,52 --> 0:5:20,3
October, 2009. U.S. Army post in Afghanistan.
53 American soldiers were attacked by an estimated


63
0:5:20,3 --> 0:5:26,54
300 Taliban fighters. Staff Sergeant Clint
Romesha was there. More than half the Americans


64
0:5:26,54 --> 0:5:31,96
were killed or wounded, including Romesha.
But he led counterattacks against the Taliban


65
0:5:31,96 --> 0:5:37,44
forces that helped the Americans regain control
of parts of the base. It helped them recover


66
0:5:37,44 --> 0:5:42,139
comrades who were killed or wounded, and it
gave them time to call for support. Because


67
0:5:42,139 --> 0:5:47,169
of his actions that day. Sergeant Romesha
is the newest recipient of the Medal of Honor.


68
0:5:47,169 --> 0:5:51,63
It is the military`s highest decoration given
to troops who risk their lives while going


69
0:5:51,63 --> 0:5:56,479
above and beyond the call of duty. Clint Romesha
is the fourth living person to earn the Medal


70
0:5:56,479 --> 0:5:59,24
of Honor for actions in Afghanistan or Iraq.

Abraham Lincoln? You`ve got three seconds,


76
0:6:25,99 --> 0:6:27,199
go!


77
0:6:27,199 --> 0:6:35,99
Today marks 204 years since Abraham Lincoln
was born. That`s your answer and that`s your

80
0:6:38,94 --> 0:6:45,68
AZUZ: January 1st, 1863, America was entering
its third year of a devastating civil war.


81
0:6:45,68 --> 0:6:49,77
President Abraham Lincoln decided to broaden
the goals of the war beyond the battlefield


82
0:6:49,77 --> 0:6:54,4
and take historic action on the question of
slavery. He picked up a pen and signed the


83
0:6:54,4 --> 0:7:0,0
document known as the Emancipation Proclamation.
It would become one of the most powerful presidential


84
0:7:0,0 --> 0:7:5,61
actions in American history. The proclamation
said that "all persons held as slaves within


85
0:7:5,61 --> 0:7:10,34
any State of designated part of a State, the
people whereof shall then be in rebellion


86
0:7:10,34 --> 0:7:15,259
against the United States, shall be then,
thenceforward, and forever free."


87
0:7:15,259 --> 0:7:20,77
Some historians estimate these words freed
as many as 4 million slaves. Some former slaves


88
0:7:20,77 --> 0:7:26,389
in occupied territories then joined Union
Forces, the liberated became liberators. It


89
0:7:26,389 --> 0:7:31,11
also changed the character of the Civil War.
The Union was now fighting to create a new


90
0:7:31,11 --> 0:7:37,289
United States, one without slavery. Historians
have called the proclamation the first step


91
0:7:37,289 --> 0:7:42,71
toward freedom for African Americans. It did
not completely end slavery in the U.S., it


92
0:7:42,71 --> 0:7:48,9
technically freed the slaves only in the Confederacy,
the states that were fighting the Union. But


93
0:7:48,9 --> 0:7:53,43
the proclamation tipped the scales in favor
of those who wanted slavery to end. In the


94
0:7:53,43 --> 0:7:57,449
years and decades that followed what became
known as the civil rights amendments, the


95
0:7:57,449 --> 0:8:3,58
13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution
freed all slaves, gave them the same legal


96
0:8:3,58 --> 0:8:8,55
rights enjoyed by white Americans and gave
black men the right to vote. The document


97
0:8:8,55 --> 0:8:13,5
that started it all, the original Emancipation
Proclamation, is kept in the National Archives


98
0:8:13,5 --> 0:8:16,61
in Washington, D.C.


99
0:8:16,61 --> 0:8:21,53
When we reported last week to the U.S. Post
Offices planning end Saturday delivery, 53


100
0:8:21,53 --> 0:8:26,139
percent of the students on our blog said this
will matter. Allen says he has checks, college


101
0:8:26,139 --> 0:8:30,77
applications and family letters in the mail.
Meghan writes her boyfriend is a Marine, "the


102
0:8:30,77 --> 0:8:35,169
only way I will soon be able to talk to him
is through letters and mail." Lisa calls this


103
0:8:35,169 --> 0:8:39,459
"... no big deal to people of the 21st century"
who email, text or call if something needs


104
0:8:39,459 --> 0:8:44,43
to be shared. But Priscilla argues, "It`s
not the same as a tangible letter." It`s harder


105
0:8:44,43 --> 0:8:49,62
to keep a treasured letter when all it is,
is a bit of data on computer."


106
0:8:49,62 --> 0:8:55,16
Walking a dog -- not that interesting. Walking
a horse -- getting better. A dog walking a


107
0:8:55,16 --> 0:9:0,88
horse, jackpot. Now, the pooch is persisting
in this Youtube video, but the mare just wants


108
0:9:0,88 --> 0:9:6,14
to mosey. So it looks like our main event
is a good old-fashioned tug of war. You think


109
0:9:6,14 --> 0:9:11,51
the horse would rein supreme, but it`s been
settled with the walking companion, and obviously,


110
0:9:11,51 --> 0:9:18,18
wants to unleash its energy. So, eventually,
the horse does give in, and let the dog dictate


111
0:9:18,18 --> 0:9:21,24
the pace, even if it did this start this whole
thing of as a naysayer.


112
0:9:21,24 --> 0:9:26,17
All right, it`s time for us to walk off. Teachers,
