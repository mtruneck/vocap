###75 A spectacular find of a fossil forest in China has garnered some interest.  Buried
###81 in volcanic ash, these trees were apparently buried in-situ, that is, buried
###86 upright, right where they grew.  While I have no problem with the idea of in-situ
###91 burial, so far every time I have investigated claims of "in-situ burial," the
###97 claims didn't hold up.  This could be a first, simply because of the description of
###102 the site.  Fossil trees buried and preserved upright in the fossil record are quite
###107 common - I've personally studied such finds In New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,
###111 Alberta and British Columbia, Yellowstone National park, Tennessee, Pennsylvania,
###115 Colorado and New Mexico.  Such fossils which are buried vertically in the rock are
###120 called polystrate - poly for many, strate for the strata of rock that the fossil cuts
###126 through. most of the Chinese fossil trees are not
###130 trees at all, but rather giant, hollow reeds, the same kind of plants as those found at
###136 Joggins, Nova Scotia. Rock layers are alleged to have taken at
###141 least thousands, perhaps millions of years to accumulate.  But then we find
###147 polystrate fossils cutting through such layers - well, those trunks won't remain in
###152 place for tens of years, let alone thousands, or millions.
###155 Yet that is precisely what we are expected to believe: When one reads the literature
###161 available at the Joggins Fossil Center, or the Museum of Nova Scotia website, they
###165 couldn't be more clear.
###167 On the Joggins Fossil Cliffs Visitor's center website, we read:
###176 We also see a story drawn in Laing Ferguson's book from the museum of
###180 Nova Scotia, and at the Joggins visitor's center, painting a clear picture of gradual
###185 burial over time. The Chinese fossil plants are all buried in
###190 a layer just 66 centimeters thick, uncovered in a coal mine.  There were
###195 some trunks that were reported suspended in the rock on an angle - not
###200 straight up and down - almost as if the trunk was buried while fallling! Of course,
###205 we also see this at Joggins and elsewhere as well. Clearly these layers did not take
###211 thousands or millions of years to accumulate.
###213 On the Museum of Nova Scotia website, we read:
###237 We also read on the Museum of Nova Scotia Website:
###266 Yet we find some stumps buried polystrate through coal seams! And
###273 sometimes coal seams are a mere quarter inch thick - were they quarter inch deep
###277 swamps?  The Chinese find was also found in a coal mine, allegedly a peat bog.
###283 Obviously, there are huge problems with the conventional interpretation of time
###288 and the origin of coal. There's also a problem with the "in situ"
###293 interpretation of the stumps - for example, some stumps of polystrates
###297 have their roots sheered off, while other roots have had their rootlets stripped off -
###302 clear evidence that the plants have been uprooted, then buried elsewhere in an
###306 upright position.  Some of the stumps are upside down.
###311 Now I proved just how lousy a gardener I was when all of my plants commited
###315 suicide, however, one thing I did NOT do wrong, was try to grow my plants upside
###320 down.  Last I checked, plants don't grow well at all upside down and underground.
###326 While studying dinosaur tracks at a coal mine in Alberta with a young geologist, I
###331 noted a most unusual phenomena: dozens of upside down, polystrate
###336 stumps from a giant, hollow reed like the lycopods of Joggins.  The roots went into
###343 the coal which was on top of the dinosaur tracks.  Obviously, the coal, the dinosaur
###349 tracks, and the layers the dinosaur tracks are in that the trunks cut through, were all
###356 laid down RAPIDLY. There is no thousands or milliions of years here, the
###361 conventional interpretations used to prop up the ideas of an old earth collapse upon
###366 scientific investigation.  All of these facts, however, can fit in well within a global
###371 catastrophe like Noah's flood.
###375 With all of my talk both on this program and in my CrEvo rants that evolution must
###379 violate the scientific and natural law of biogenesis, TheScienceFoundation has
###383 repeatedly tried to "educate me"  by claiming that Louis Pasteur actually
###389 disproved a form of creationism and that the law of biogenesis only applies to
###394 modern life. [Pasteur: HUH?"]  It's obvious he got this idea from Mark
###397 Isaak's page on talk.organs, which says:
###420 Now if your brain just locked up, don't worry - this is a common side effect from
###424 trying to understand illogical arguments.
###427 To be clear on the matter, let us hear the words of Pasteur himself on the subject:
###451 Pasteur was precisely refuting the idea that increasingly complex molecules
###455 could form primitive life.  Apparently Isaak and TheScienceFoundation are hoping
###460 the laws of physics and nature were DIFFERENT in the past.  That's wonderful
###465 to speculate, but the onus is upon you folks for demonstrating that life can form
###471 from non-life, as the science that's repeatable, observable, testable refutes
###477 you.
###479 But it also blows me away that both Isaak and theScienceFoundation both claimed
###482 that Pasteur actually refuted a form of creationism.  Really?
###488 In the words of Dr. Manny Rios:
###499 Brock Lee said essentially the same thing:
###526 Lee documents this well in his book "Comparative Views on Origins."
###531 It is a ludicrous statement to claim that Pasteur refuted creation - read Pasteur's
###538 comments yourself, he knew full well the ramifications of his experiment. Every
###544 form of creation that I know of claims that life only comes from life. Now yes, we
###549 claim that the first life arose from outside of nature, but in the end, that is exactly
###554 what evolution must also contend, because the first life has to arise in direct
###559 violation of scientific and natural laws - therefore if it violates natural laws, it must
###564 be SUPERnatural, or outside of the natural realm!
###569 Ironically, both Isaak and thesciencefoundation have both claimed
###573 elsewhere that evolution does not attempt to explain the origin of life - so doesn't it
###579 seem odd to you that they would suddenly turn around and try to argue
###582 against the law of biogenesis? The first life had to have come from
###587 outside of the natural realm - I would suggest that first life was Jesus Christ,
###592 the Creator.

###599 Wahoo! Mail for me?

###610 Theot58 wrote in for last week's show:
###625 Eagleeye2102 was definitely appropriately named, as they saw my subliminal
###629 message in last weeks show:
###654 Thanks for writing in, but apparently you missed the fun from the week before, and
###659 several shows back where I showed how all of the alleged fish-tetrapod
###664 intermediates were invalidated, both by tetrapod footprints found in Poland, as
###669 well as the tetrapod footprints in the bottom of Grand Canyon, which John
###673 Mackay publicized back in 1987 - Footprints in rocks evolutionarily dated as
###679 525 million years old, which I also went and investigated several years ago.  These
###685 clear tetrapod footprints predate the alleged fishapods by some 130 million
###690 years!  Those fossil footprints are only one small part of the literally tons of
###696 evidence FOR creation, and refuting Evolutionism that you are apparently
###700 unaware of.
###741 No, you are talking about pseudoscience. Apparently you missed the point I was
###745 making: If a prediction is made based on evolution, as I showed in the previous
###750 show, it fails the predictions miserably. Evolution would not predict tetrapod
###757 footprints in 525 million year old rock!  But rather than concede that evolution is
###762 wrong, evolution is then made to FIT the evidence, no matter what the evidence is!
###769 Therefore, evolution is not scientific because it is not falsifiable.
###775 Several people commented on the interesting report of the slowing spin of
###778 Venus:
###795 Your analogy breaks down horribly!  We're not talking about a 1 degree temperature
###800 change here. We're talking about a rotation change of 6-1/2 minutes in 16
###805 years! Secondly, I never said the slowing was constant, I merely pointed out the
###811 implications if it was. And isn't it amazing how quickly the skeptics will abandon
###817 uniformity when it doesn't meet their purposes.
###822 The science foundation also jumped on this one, and was put in his place by T
###825 Chapman500:
###867 Indeed, the physics are quite simple - such alleged impacts would destroy the
###872 planet, and if there was a continuing barrage of small impacts slowing it down
###876 or spinning it retrograde, then we SHOULD SEE EVIDENCE OF THIS, as the
###882 slowing has persisted even in the past 16 years.
###900 Thank you for writing in herbiepop
###922 Very interesting you predicted that Orenotter, and glad to see your
###926 predictions shown true.
