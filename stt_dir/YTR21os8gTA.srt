1
0:0:32,13 --> 0:0:39,7
They go from expected to extraordinary
in a blink of an eye.


2
0:0:39,7 --> 0:0:48,57
You’re awestricken; they transform themselves
into something that you’ve never seen before.


3
0:0:48,57 --> 0:0:51,42
They swagger


4
0:0:51,42 --> 0:0:54,68
and serenade,


5
0:0:54,68 --> 0:0:57,98
they dance


6
0:0:57,98 --> 0:1:2,84
and display.


7
0:1:2,84 --> 0:1:5,58
They’re unlike any creatures on earth


8
0:1:5,58 --> 0:1:10,91
and one of the most astounding phenomena
ever witnessed:


9
0:1:10,91 --> 0:1:15,96
The Birds-of-Paradise.


10
0:1:15,96 --> 0:1:22,7
Found here in the nearly impenetrable mountains 
And valleys of the island of New Guinea,


11
0:1:22,7 --> 0:1:28,58
in the greatest remaining tract of rain
forest in the entire Asia-Pacific region,


12
0:1:28,58 --> 0:1:34,8
they exist nowhere else on earth.


13
0:1:34,8 --> 0:1:40,33
The vast, vast majority of the land around here 
has no road access, they’re just looking


14
0:1:40,33 --> 0:1:49,21
up into a wall of steep slope and you can tell that
this is just ridge after ridge and valley after valley.


15
0:1:49,21 --> 0:1:54,509
Evolutionary biologist Ed Scholes and
wildlife photographer Tim Laman


16
0:1:54,509 --> 0:1:59,259
have spent the better part of a decade
trekking into this isolated wilderness


17
0:1:59,259 --> 0:2:8,0
in pursuit of all thirty-nine species 
of these miraculous birds.


18
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:13,609
Well, the only way to see the king bird-of-paradise is to
climb up into the trees where they live,


19
0:2:13,609 --> 0:2:16,99
so I’m headed up to my platform.


20
0:2:16,99 --> 0:2:18,149
They've been photographing,


21
0:2:18,149 --> 0:2:24,18
analyzing, and recording their every move,


22
0:2:24,18 --> 0:2:26,139
every behavior,


23
0:2:26,139 --> 0:2:32,259
in an attempt to comprehend their
secrets, and in doing so


24
0:2:32,259 --> 0:2:36,98
revealing extreme examples of the
miracle of evolution.


25
0:2:36,98 --> 0:2:41,69
The birds-of-paradise represent one of these
singular events in evolution that stand out


26
0:2:41,69 --> 0:2:42,519
that are extraordinary.


27
0:2:42,519 --> 0:2:46,989
They’re something that’s without precedent, 
something that evolved that’s so unique and  


28
0:2:46,989 --> 0:2:48,509
so exceptional


29
0:2:48,509 --> 0:3:40,899
that you’re driven to say why or, you know, 
how did that happen, how did that come to be?


30
0:3:40,899 --> 0:3:45,209
The birds-of-paradise are remarkable not
only for their exceptional beauty,


31
0:3:45,209 --> 0:3:48,379
and almost other worldly appearance,


32
0:3:48,379 --> 0:3:54,729
but as veritable living textbooks on
adaptation and sexual selection.


33
0:3:54,729 --> 0:3:57,219
The females are looking at this whole
package


34
0:3:57,219 --> 0:4:1,509
and can discern something about him by
minor variation.


35
0:4:1,509 --> 0:4:4,829
The more complex it is the harder it is
to make it look right.  If one little


36
0:4:4,829 --> 0:4:8,919
feature is out of whack you’re going 
to be able to tell. 


37
0:4:8,919 --> 0:4:15,449
What about New Guinea has led to these
birds evolving here and nowhere else?


38
0:4:15,449 --> 0:4:20,159
What function do their outrageous
plumes and ornaments play,


39
0:4:20,159 --> 0:4:23,409
and what exactly are they doing?


40
0:4:23,409 --> 0:4:27,399
For me it still always goes back to the 
original driving question, you know, and


41
0:4:27,399 --> 0:4:33,27
that's how did it happen?  
How did the birds-of-paradise come to be?


42
0:4:33,27 --> 0:4:37,139
Witness diverse strategies of 
evolution at work 


43
0:4:37,139 --> 0:4:41,479
and experience one of nature's most
extraordinary hidden wonders


44
0:4:41,479 --> 0:4:45,34
up close.


45
0:4:45,34 --> 0:4:50,37
A world where beauty
and behavior are intertwined,


46
0:4:50,37 --> 0:4:52,229
a spectacle not possible


47
0:4:52,229 --> 0:6:52,229
any other place on earth.
