1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:11,477



2
0:0:11,477 --> 0:0:13,972
MALE SPEAKER: And your hand
shakes from Parkinson's?


3
0:0:13,972 --> 0:0:15,97
THOM DEVITA: Yes, and you
noticed my hand shaking?


4
0:0:15,97 --> 0:0:19,817
MALE SPEAKER: And how long ago
did Parkinson's set in?


5
0:0:19,817 --> 0:0:22,152
THOM DEVITA: About a year
and a half ago.


6
0:0:22,152 --> 0:0:25,43
I was born with a
central tremor.


7
0:0:25,43 --> 0:0:30,22
A central tremor shakes when
you pick something up.


8
0:0:30,22 --> 0:0:33,385
Parkinson's stops when you
pick something up.


9
0:0:33,385 --> 0:0:36,85
When the Parkinson's stops, the
central tremor immediately


10
0:0:36,85 --> 0:0:39,13
takes over.


11
0:0:39,13 --> 0:0:41,16
MALE SPEAKER: That
got you all in.


12
0:0:41,16 --> 0:0:44,25
THOM DEVITA: There's
also another one.


13
0:0:44,25 --> 0:0:47,745
You ever see somebody so
scared they shake?


14
0:0:47,745 --> 0:0:50,19
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


15
0:0:50,19 --> 0:0:55,9
THOM DEVITA: I asked this today
of the neurologist, if


16
0:0:55,9 --> 0:1:0,585
being scared could make your
hands shake, if that was part


17
0:1:0,585 --> 0:1:1,95
of a central tremor.


18
0:1:1,95 --> 0:1:7,63
He says no, no, no, but that's
another kind of tremor and he


19
0:1:7,63 --> 0:1:10,62
had a name for it.


20
0:1:10,62 --> 0:1:14,3
I forgot the name, but I
think I got that also.


21
0:1:14,3 --> 0:1:15,56
MALE SPEAKER: You have
all the tremors?


22
0:1:15,56 --> 0:1:17,22
THOM DEVITA: All the
three tremors.


23
0:1:17,22 --> 0:1:19,13
MALE SPEAKER: What are you
scared of, you think?


24
0:1:19,13 --> 0:1:20,8
THOM DEVITA: It's mental.


25
0:1:20,8 --> 0:1:25,712
You don't know, the mind works
without even you knowing it.


26
0:1:25,712 --> 0:1:47,4



27
0:1:47,4 --> 0:1:50,11
JOHN WYATT: Well, somebody
else told me that Thom


28
0:1:50,11 --> 0:1:52,97
actually moved to Newburgh,
New York.


29
0:1:52,97 --> 0:1:55,79
I know that he moved there,
because his wife took an


30
0:1:55,79 --> 0:1:59,37
engineering job for IBM.


31
0:1:59,37 --> 0:2:1,94
When I got up there, he greeted
me on the porch.


32
0:2:1,94 --> 0:2:4,63
And I said to him, Thom,
I'm shocked that you


33
0:2:4,63 --> 0:2:5,65
moved out of New York.


34
0:2:5,65 --> 0:2:8,459
You never were comfortable
being outside of it.


35
0:2:8,459 --> 0:2:10,58
And he said, but think
about this.


36
0:2:10,58 --> 0:2:13,95
I always lived a couple blocks
from the Hudson River.


37
0:2:13,95 --> 0:2:17,12
When I was a kid in Harlem, we
lived near the Hudson River,


38
0:2:17,12 --> 0:2:20,5
when I was on the Lower East
Side, I wasn't far from it.


39
0:2:20,5 --> 0:2:22,83
And then he pointed, and
he said there it


40
0:2:22,83 --> 0:2:24,34
is, two blocks away.


41
0:2:24,34 --> 0:2:32,84



42
0:2:32,84 --> 0:2:36,93
MALE SPEAKER: How long have
you lived over here?


43
0:2:36,93 --> 0:2:38,622
NICK BUBASH: Remember when we
moved out of your apartment on


44
0:2:38,622 --> 0:2:39,83
Fourth Street?


45
0:2:39,83 --> 0:2:43,1
There was that one closet
we'd never open, and you


46
0:2:43,1 --> 0:2:45,266
said don't open it.


47
0:2:45,266 --> 0:2:46,89
You remember that?


48
0:2:46,89 --> 0:2:47,87
There was so much stuff.


49
0:2:47,87 --> 0:2:50,71
Remember we had to hold the
stuff, I think [INAUDIBLE]


50
0:2:50,71 --> 0:2:51,39
held the stuff.


51
0:2:51,39 --> 0:2:54,28
And then we slammed the doors
of the truck real fast so it


52
0:2:54,28 --> 0:2:55,66
wouldn't all fall out.


53
0:2:55,66 --> 0:2:56,98
There was so much stuff.


54
0:2:56,98 --> 0:2:59,36
We took the doors off the
hinges, everything, because he


55
0:2:59,36 --> 0:3:1,15
had made art out
of everything.


56
0:3:1,15 --> 0:3:6,16
And I drove the truck and Jenny
went the wrong way.


57
0:3:6,16 --> 0:3:9,206
Oh boy, it was crazy getting
up here, but we did it.


58
0:3:9,206 --> 0:3:10,71
SCOTT HARRISON: I mean, I'm sure
he probably would have


59
0:3:10,71 --> 0:3:13,78
preferred to stay in Manhattan
his whole life, but that


60
0:3:13,78 --> 0:3:14,915
didn't work out.


61
0:3:14,915 --> 0:3:16,42
NICK BUBASH: Yeah, we
took a train out.


62
0:3:16,42 --> 0:3:18,8
You remember when Cliff
Raven came?


63
0:3:18,8 --> 0:3:22,54
SCOTT HARRISON: But he said if
you're not in Manhattan, you


64
0:3:22,54 --> 0:3:24,45
might as well be anywhere.


65
0:3:24,45 --> 0:3:25,73
And Newburgh was anywhere.


66
0:3:25,73 --> 0:3:31,958



67
0:3:31,958 --> 0:3:33,82
ROBERT RYAN: It's definitely
a pilgrimage.


68
0:3:33,82 --> 0:3:36,29
I always feel great
after I go.


69
0:3:36,29 --> 0:3:40,0
Well, first you make an
arrangement to go see him.


70
0:3:40,0 --> 0:3:42,646
THOM DEVITA: Visits
by referral only.


71
0:3:42,646 --> 0:3:44,88
ROBERT RYAN: Once the dog
mellows out and then you can


72
0:3:44,88 --> 0:3:46,54
walk a little bit more
freely around.


73
0:3:46,54 --> 0:3:50,61
And he'll start to show you all
this amazing art that he's


74
0:3:50,61 --> 0:3:53,26
been making since he's moved
up there, and probably even


75
0:3:53,26 --> 0:3:54,51
before he was up there.


76
0:3:54,51 --> 0:4:1,6



77
0:4:1,6 --> 0:4:5,22
His work area and his living
area are the same thing.


78
0:4:5,22 --> 0:4:10,11
He lives within what he's
creating every day.


79
0:4:10,11 --> 0:4:13,24
Going into Thom's home
studio was like the


80
0:4:13,24 --> 0:4:14,66
next level for me.


81
0:4:14,66 --> 0:4:18,286
I had seen his tattoos, I had
seen some of the art that he


82
0:4:18,286 --> 0:4:19,329
had been making.


83
0:4:19,329 --> 0:4:23,44
But to see it in his place is
like, now you're seeing the


84
0:4:23,44 --> 0:4:27,67
true living art, it's
everywhere.


85
0:4:27,67 --> 0:4:30,62
It's like going to a museum.


86
0:4:30,62 --> 0:4:33,36
By the end, I'm not sure
what I'd even seen.


87
0:4:33,36 --> 0:4:37,9
I'm just overwhelmed, there's so
much of it and it's such a


88
0:4:37,9 --> 0:4:41,35
strong, powerful volume that
it's kind of disorienting


89
0:4:41,35 --> 0:4:43,5
after a while.


90
0:4:43,5 --> 0:4:45,35
THOM DEVITA: You want to
see a Sailor Jerry?


91
0:4:45,35 --> 0:4:46,6
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


92
0:4:46,6 --> 0:4:51,486



93
0:4:51,486 --> 0:4:52,525
Is that an original?


94
0:4:52,525 --> 0:4:53,155
THOM DEVITA: Yes.


95
0:4:53,155 --> 0:4:55,705
MALE SPEAKER: And you put this
Gotham Tattoo stamp on it?


96
0:4:55,705 --> 0:4:58,6
THOM DEVITA: Yes, it
belongs to me.


97
0:4:58,6 --> 0:5:1,2
I can do anything
I want with it.


98
0:5:1,2 --> 0:5:4,14
That's the way I feel about art,
if it belongs to you, you


99
0:5:4,14 --> 0:5:6,31
can do anything you
want with it.


100
0:5:6,31 --> 0:5:8,45
Unless you made a deal with
the artist that you


101
0:5:8,45 --> 0:5:10,434
couldn't touch it.


102
0:5:10,434 --> 0:5:12,34
I collect all kind of things.


103
0:5:12,34 --> 0:5:13,78
MALE SPEAKER: I've noticed.


104
0:5:13,78 --> 0:5:17,45
THOM DEVITA: I think they're
nice, they're good-looking.


105
0:5:17,45 --> 0:5:19,3
NICK BUBASH: Thom and I were
always hunting for objects.


106
0:5:19,3 --> 0:5:23,475
We'd go trashing, go into
stores, and antique stores or


107
0:5:23,475 --> 0:5:24,16
junk shops.


108
0:5:24,16 --> 0:5:27,65
And we were always looking
for objects, constantly.


109
0:5:27,65 --> 0:5:29,55
That was one of his big things,
he got a lot of


110
0:5:29,55 --> 0:5:33,41
inspiration out of anything.


111
0:5:33,41 --> 0:5:37,115
My relationship with Thom
deVita, well, at this point I


112
0:5:37,115 --> 0:5:38,84
suppose you could
say good friend.


113
0:5:38,84 --> 0:5:41,88
But he was my mentor,
my teacher.


114
0:5:41,88 --> 0:5:44,976
I first met him, I think,
about 1971.


115
0:5:44,976 --> 0:5:47,925
MALE SPEAKER: Did you teach
Nick how to tattoo?


116
0:5:47,925 --> 0:5:50,38
THOM DEVITA: You never tattooed
before you met me.


117
0:5:50,38 --> 0:5:50,82
NICK BUBASH: No.


118
0:5:50,82 --> 0:5:55,735
THOM DEVITA: He's the only guy
who ever tattooed in my shop.


119
0:5:55,735 --> 0:5:59,7
NICK BUBASH: I tattooed in his
shop on Fourth Street.


120
0:5:59,7 --> 0:6:1,43
I can't remember how
I found him.


121
0:6:1,43 --> 0:6:4,5
I think I just found him, and
there he was, he was sitting


122
0:6:4,5 --> 0:6:5,34
on the stoop.


123
0:6:5,34 --> 0:6:7,11
I walked up to him and
said I was interested


124
0:6:7,11 --> 0:6:8,71
in getting a tattoo.


125
0:6:8,71 --> 0:6:11,87
I followed him into
his studio, and


126
0:6:11,87 --> 0:6:12,812
that's how I met him.


127
0:6:12,812 --> 0:6:15,32
I looked for him and
I found him.


128
0:6:15,32 --> 0:6:18,93
I got these in 1973 or
something like that.


129
0:6:18,93 --> 0:6:19,91
There's a big fish.


130
0:6:19,91 --> 0:6:23,4
Here, I'll take my shirt off if
you promise not to take a


131
0:6:23,4 --> 0:6:24,7
picture of my body.


132
0:6:24,7 --> 0:6:25,753
I'm getting old and fat.


133
0:6:25,753 --> 0:6:28,17
THOM DEVITA: I'm getting
old and skinny.


134
0:6:28,17 --> 0:6:30,645
I am old and skinny.


135
0:6:30,645 --> 0:6:33,555
NICK BUBASH: This is a
early Japanese fish.


136
0:6:33,555 --> 0:6:37,7
MALE SPEAKER: It looks a lot
like your style of tattooing.


137
0:6:37,7 --> 0:6:41,538
NICK BUBASH: It's where
it all began, man.


138
0:6:41,538 --> 0:6:44,58
ROBERT RYAN: Definitely two guys
that have spent a lot of


139
0:6:44,58 --> 0:6:47,16
time together and have been
through a lot together.


140
0:6:47,16 --> 0:6:51,22
And I think they're probably
best friends, as far as best


141
0:6:51,22 --> 0:6:53,174
friends can be.


142
0:6:53,174 --> 0:6:54,424
NICK BUBASH: Good bye.


143
0:6:54,424 --> 0:6:57,566



144
0:6:57,566 --> 0:7:0,6
I love you, you old
[INAUDIBLE].


145
0:7:0,6 --> 0:7:2,446
THOM DEVITA: I'm not a hugger.


146
0:7:2,446 --> 0:7:5,382
NICK BUBASH: He won't hug you.


147
0:7:5,382 --> 0:7:7,89
ROBERT RYAN: And Nick has so
much respect for Thom.


148
0:7:7,89 --> 0:7:11,36
I think he feels like Thom
helped him in a great way.


149
0:7:11,36 --> 0:7:14,86
NICK BUBASH: When I met him,
he was probably 40.


150
0:7:14,86 --> 0:7:17,17
I was 19.


151
0:7:17,17 --> 0:7:19,43
I was trying to make art, and
I was doing everything you


152
0:7:19,43 --> 0:7:20,9
have to do to stay alive
in New York.


153
0:7:20,9 --> 0:7:23,34
I was driving a cab, I was doing
landscaping, I was doing


154
0:7:23,34 --> 0:7:25,66
whatever I needed to do.


155
0:7:25,66 --> 0:7:31,91
I was basically just a working
stiff with an idea that I


156
0:7:31,91 --> 0:7:33,69
wanted to be an artist.


157
0:7:33,69 --> 0:7:35,6
I found Thom.


158
0:7:35,6 --> 0:7:36,67
I saw what he was doing.


159
0:7:36,67 --> 0:7:40,2
I really got turned on
by the fact that he


160
0:7:40,2 --> 0:7:42,89
was actually an artist.


161
0:7:42,89 --> 0:7:45,13
I thought well, I'm going to do
some big drawings and take


162
0:7:45,13 --> 0:7:46,25
them down here and
show them to him.


163
0:7:46,25 --> 0:7:47,94
So I did some big
dragon drawings.


164
0:7:47,94 --> 0:7:51,84
And when he saw the drawings,
I can remember clearly, he


165
0:7:51,84 --> 0:7:56,232
said to me, you can come back
here anytime you want to come.


166
0:7:56,232 --> 0:7:59,67
And I said OK, man, and I
was there all the time.


167
0:7:59,67 --> 0:8:2,75
deVita's influence was
enormous on me.


168
0:8:2,75 --> 0:8:7,26
Thom taught me the mental part
of it-- the attitude, the


169
0:8:7,26 --> 0:8:11,13
lifestyle, and how you create
your own reality.


170
0:8:11,13 --> 0:8:13,871
He was my greatest influence.


171
0:8:13,871 --> 0:8:17,61
ROBERT RYAN: The deVita
influence on Nick's work is


172
0:8:17,61 --> 0:8:19,12
very, very strong.


173
0:8:19,12 --> 0:8:22,28
NICK BUBASH: "The Porcupine of
God," it's painted over an old


174
0:8:22,28 --> 0:8:23,8
lithograph.


175
0:8:23,8 --> 0:8:26,99
ROBERT RYAN: And Nick comes
from definitely a more


176
0:8:26,99 --> 0:8:29,27
schooled art background.


177
0:8:29,27 --> 0:8:33,32
He does fine art sculpture,
and he does also great


178
0:8:33,32 --> 0:8:36,44
paintings and drawings and
he does these amazing


179
0:8:36,44 --> 0:8:37,24
assemblages.


180
0:8:37,24 --> 0:8:40,23
You can definitely see Thom's
influences there, and it's


181
0:8:40,23 --> 0:8:42,22
really present in his work.


182
0:8:42,22 --> 0:8:44,79
NICK BUBASH: Thom did a
lot of assemblages.


183
0:8:44,79 --> 0:8:49,77
I think that's probably where
I got the inclination to


184
0:8:49,77 --> 0:8:53,57
assemble things into works of
art, because he that a lot.


185
0:8:53,57 --> 0:8:56,83



186
0:8:56,83 --> 0:9:0,29
This is the thinking table.


187
0:9:0,29 --> 0:9:3,46
Believe it or not, there's
order to this.


188
0:9:3,46 --> 0:9:7,1
And my philosophy is that
I bring order to


189
0:9:7,1 --> 0:9:9,7
the chaos that surrounds.


190
0:9:9,7 --> 0:9:13,38
The chaos forces the order.


191
0:9:13,38 --> 0:9:16,64
This one I imagine is like a
prehistoric animal with the


192
0:9:16,64 --> 0:9:22,13
largest set of horns ever
seen or ever discovered.


193
0:9:22,13 --> 0:9:22,81
These things evolve.


194
0:9:22,81 --> 0:9:25,33
And sometimes I'll get obsessed
with one object and


195
0:9:25,33 --> 0:9:26,24
I'll start working on it.


196
0:9:26,24 --> 0:9:30,66
But at times I'll be passing by
and I'll move something on


197
0:9:30,66 --> 0:9:31,55
it or change something.


198
0:9:31,55 --> 0:9:35,24
That's kind of how
this table works.


199
0:9:35,24 --> 0:9:37,895
But as you can see, I have a
million things down here and


200
0:9:37,895 --> 0:9:40,18
I'm adding to them.


201
0:9:40,18 --> 0:9:43,16
Hopefully I'll get up to two or
three million before I die.


202
0:9:43,16 --> 0:9:46,31



203
0:9:46,31 --> 0:9:49,17
Thom's never been
to this studio.


204
0:9:49,17 --> 0:9:53,13
I think it's kind of getting
hard for him to move around.


205
0:9:53,13 --> 0:9:55,578
He's getting tired and old.


206
0:9:55,578 --> 0:9:57,6
Who knows, he may
live to be 100--


207
0:9:57,6 --> 0:9:58,695
I hope he does.


208
0:9:58,695 --> 0:9:59,69
I hope he lives to be 200.


209
0:9:59,69 --> 0:10:3,255
I hope he outlives me
because I don't want


210
0:10:3,255 --> 0:10:4,505
to see him go ever.


211
0:10:4,505 --> 0:10:12,54



212
0:10:12,54 --> 0:10:16,2
So here's the list of things
you have to do, right?


213
0:10:16,2 --> 0:10:18,1
These are the books you have
to sign and number.


214
0:10:18,1 --> 0:10:21,26



215
0:10:21,26 --> 0:10:23,5
Number two, I think all
you have to do is--


216
0:10:23,5 --> 0:10:24,57
THOM DEVITA: I won't remember
all of that.


217
0:10:24,57 --> 0:10:27,29
NICK BUBASH: Well look, books
to sign and number.


218
0:10:27,29 --> 0:10:29,49
Two, 17, 18, 19, 20.


219
0:10:29,49 --> 0:10:33,26
THOM DEVITA: Here's what I
wanted you to do, is to do one


220
0:10:33,26 --> 0:10:34,1
of these for yourself.


221
0:10:34,1 --> 0:10:36,145
This was you can tell
me [INAUDIBLE].


222
0:10:36,145 --> 0:10:37,395
NICK BUBASH: OK, give
me a piece of paper.


223
0:10:37,395 --> 0:10:41,81



224
0:10:41,81 --> 0:10:43,29
If you have any questions,
you know what to


225
0:10:43,29 --> 0:10:44,1
do with those books.


226
0:10:44,1 --> 0:10:45,8
I'm going to call you every
goddamn day until--


227
0:10:45,8 --> 0:10:49,17
THOM DEVITA: After you
sell them all.


228
0:10:49,17 --> 0:10:51,24
ED HARDY: Oh, he drives
Nick crazy.


229
0:10:51,24 --> 0:10:52,235
I mean, Nick will tell you.


230
0:10:52,235 --> 0:10:54,27
He'll call me up and
go Jesus Christ.


231
0:10:54,27 --> 0:10:59,58
And we're trying to help
Thom out a lot, but


232
0:10:59,58 --> 0:11:0,895
he's just who he is.


233
0:11:0,895 --> 0:11:2,52
THOM DEVITA: What were
we going to do?


234
0:11:2,52 --> 0:11:6,57
NICK BUBASH: We're going to
work on my piece here.


235
0:11:6,57 --> 0:11:8,48
THOM DEVITA: Oh, we're going
to do it on the original?


236
0:11:8,48 --> 0:11:9,908
NICK BUBASH: No, on this one.


237
0:11:9,908 --> 0:11:11,12
Yeah, on the original,
not on the book.


238
0:11:11,12 --> 0:11:13,17
THOM DEVITA: OK, I'm confused.


239
0:11:13,17 --> 0:11:15,48
NICK BUBASH: We collaborated
on a bunch of stuff.


240
0:11:15,48 --> 0:11:18,27
He would send me stuff and then
I'd re-do it, and then


241
0:11:18,27 --> 0:11:19,24
he'd re-do it.


242
0:11:19,24 --> 0:11:21,19
And finally he told
me [INAUDIBLE]


243
0:11:21,19 --> 0:11:23,426
I didn't know what I was
doing and he quit.


244
0:11:23,426 --> 0:11:26,15



245
0:11:26,15 --> 0:11:29,6
He didn't like what
I was doing.


246
0:11:29,6 --> 0:11:31,635
Were you going to make the
whole goddamn thing red?


247
0:11:31,635 --> 0:11:33,12
THOM DEVITA: No, Sherlock.


248
0:11:33,12 --> 0:11:37,9



249
0:11:37,9 --> 0:11:38,975
If you don't like it,
you can erase it.


250
0:11:38,975 --> 0:11:42,37
NICK BUBASH: If I don't like
it, I can erase it.


251
0:11:42,37 --> 0:11:44,992
He was never mean or harmful.


252
0:11:44,992 --> 0:11:47,61
He would criticize
you, there's no


253
0:11:47,61 --> 0:11:48,91
two ways about that.


254
0:11:48,91 --> 0:11:51,28
He would say well,
do you like this?


255
0:11:51,28 --> 0:11:52,34
And I'd say no, I
don't like it.


256
0:11:52,34 --> 0:11:54,775
And he'd say well, you
just aren't advanced


257
0:11:54,775 --> 0:11:56,273
enough to like it.


258
0:11:56,273 --> 0:11:58,31
THOM DEVITA: Nick, did you
see the poster for the


259
0:11:58,31 --> 0:11:59,37
show we were in?


260
0:11:59,37 --> 0:12:1,381
This is one that I made up.


261
0:12:1,381 --> 0:12:5,59
NICK BUBASH: Mine and Ed's don't
have the copper border


262
0:12:5,59 --> 0:12:6,45
that he put on there.


263
0:12:6,45 --> 0:12:9,65
But when I go home I'm going to
put a copper border on mine


264
0:12:9,65 --> 0:12:10,79
same that Thom did.


265
0:12:10,79 --> 0:12:12,99
THOM DEVITA: You don't know
what brush I used.


266
0:12:12,99 --> 0:12:16,66
NICK BUBASH: Well, I mean, how's
anybody going to know?


267
0:12:16,66 --> 0:12:20,505
THOM DEVITA: If I hadn't told
you it was copper, he would


268
0:12:20,505 --> 0:12:21,6
have done it in gold.


269
0:12:21,6 --> 0:12:22,46
NICK BUBASH: No.


270
0:12:22,46 --> 0:12:25,155
You know what, you
can use that.


271
0:12:25,155 --> 0:12:26,84
I know what to use.


272
0:12:26,84 --> 0:12:28,71
THOM DEVITA: Well, you would
have done it in gold.


273
0:12:28,71 --> 0:12:30,395
NICK BUBASH: No, I would
have done it in copper.


274
0:12:30,395 --> 0:12:32,25
I've learned to use copper.


275
0:12:32,25 --> 0:12:34,77
JOHN WYATT: It could be
argumentative, but I think a


276
0:12:34,77 --> 0:12:38,59
lot of that was he liked to
play a lot of semantics.


277
0:12:38,59 --> 0:12:41,192
ROBERT RYAN: That's me
getting tattooed.


278
0:12:41,192 --> 0:12:42,65
I'm not sure who took
this photo.


279
0:12:42,65 --> 0:12:43,19
So you remember?


280
0:12:43,19 --> 0:12:46,638
THOM DEVITA: I claim all them
things to be mine beyond


281
0:12:46,638 --> 0:12:48,84
[INAUDIBLE].


282
0:12:48,84 --> 0:12:50,61
ROBERT RYAN: But you couldn't
do the tattoo and take the


283
0:12:50,61 --> 0:12:54,53
photo at the same time, so
someone had to take it.


284
0:12:54,53 --> 0:12:56,942
THOM DEVITA: That's
not important.


285
0:12:56,942 --> 0:12:58,758
MALE SPEAKER: Do you ever get
nervous that you're going to


286
0:12:58,758 --> 0:12:59,75
misspeak around him?


287
0:12:59,75 --> 0:13:1,44
ROBERT RYAN: Always.


288
0:13:1,44 --> 0:13:5,91
But he'll tell me
that I misspoke.


289
0:13:5,91 --> 0:13:8,97
THOM DEVITA: It's true, but
it's a little mixed up.


290
0:13:8,97 --> 0:13:10,855
No, that's not what
I'm saying.


291
0:13:10,855 --> 0:13:13,805
I said yes, yeah, no.


292
0:13:13,805 --> 0:13:16,317
ROBERT RYAN: Ed still has the
stencil for your dragon on the


293
0:13:16,317 --> 0:13:19,12
center of your chest.


294
0:13:19,12 --> 0:13:20,48
THOM DEVITA: No, he doesn't.


295
0:13:20,48 --> 0:13:21,736
ROBERT RYAN: No?


296
0:13:21,736 --> 0:13:23,648
THOM DEVITA: I got
the stencil.


297
0:13:23,648 --> 0:13:24,126
ROBERT RYAN: Oh yeah?


298
0:13:24,126 --> 0:13:26,834
THOM DEVITA: I was thinking
about it the other day, but I


299
0:13:26,834 --> 0:13:27,95
haven't seen it for a while.


300
0:13:27,95 --> 0:13:30,61
ROBERT RYAN: Do you think
maybe he took it?


301
0:13:30,61 --> 0:13:33,57
THOM DEVITA: No.


302
0:13:33,57 --> 0:13:37,378
Unless I cut another stencil
and I gave him that one.


303
0:13:37,378 --> 0:13:38,32
CLAYTON PATTERSON:
Thom is an au


304
0:13:38,32 --> 0:13:39,86
contraire kind of character.


305
0:13:39,86 --> 0:13:41,88
His whole thing is
kind of arguing


306
0:13:41,88 --> 0:13:43,54
and setting up debates.


307
0:13:43,54 --> 0:13:46,65
And it's a certain kind of
Italian, a little Sicilian


308
0:13:46,65 --> 0:13:47,31
kind of thing.


309
0:13:47,31 --> 0:13:50,63
Throwing a lot of salt in there
and the fire and getting


310
0:13:50,63 --> 0:13:51,58
the sparks going.


311
0:13:51,58 --> 0:13:53,61
NICK BUBASH: [INAUDIBLE]
machines and you could tattoo


312
0:13:53,61 --> 0:13:55,9
with them, but it was tough.


313
0:13:55,9 --> 0:13:58,605
It was tough to get the
coloring with them.


314
0:13:58,605 --> 0:14:2,72
THOM DEVITA: No, you could
tattoo with a Spaulding


315
0:14:2,72 --> 0:14:4,81
machine if you know
how to tattoo.


316
0:14:4,81 --> 0:14:6,25
NICK BUBASH: Right,
that's true.


317
0:14:6,25 --> 0:14:8,76
THOM DEVITA: If you don't know
how to tattoo, you got to go


318
0:14:8,76 --> 0:14:9,47
to somebody else maybe.


319
0:14:9,47 --> 0:14:11,5
NICK BUBASH: Do you understand
my point?


320
0:14:11,5 --> 0:14:12,24
Like, with a better
tool you can--


321
0:14:12,24 --> 0:14:12,66
THOM DEVITA: No.


322
0:14:12,66 --> 0:14:15,185
ED HARDY: I don't know if I've
ever seen Thom visibly excited


323
0:14:15,185 --> 0:14:18,46
in my life, except if he gets
mad about something.


324
0:14:18,46 --> 0:14:19,5
He's really stubborn.


325
0:14:19,5 --> 0:14:20,93
He's really opinionated.


326
0:14:20,93 --> 0:14:22,61
I mean, you can get into an
argument with him about what


327
0:14:22,61 --> 0:14:26,6
the correct term is if you're
locking the card door.


328
0:14:26,6 --> 0:14:29,12
I mean, you just get into
stuff all the time.


329
0:14:29,12 --> 0:14:31,67
THOM DEVITA: What's this guy you
mentioned the other day?


330
0:14:31,67 --> 0:14:33,17
NICK BUBASH: R. Crumb.


331
0:14:33,17 --> 0:14:34,95
THOM DEVITA: Yeah,
I dislike him.


332
0:14:34,95 --> 0:14:36,735
NICK BUBASH: You don't
like R. Crumb?


333
0:14:36,735 --> 0:14:39,18
THOM DEVITA: No, I don't
like cartoons.


334
0:14:39,18 --> 0:14:40,42
You understand that?


335
0:14:40,42 --> 0:14:42,47
NICK BUBASH: But you've got
nothing against R. Crumb?


336
0:14:42,47 --> 0:14:43,99
THOM DEVITA: I don't know
him, so I don't know


337
0:14:43,99 --> 0:14:44,32
anything about him.


338
0:14:44,32 --> 0:14:45,905
I don't like his work.


339
0:14:45,905 --> 0:14:48,6
NICK BUBASH: You don't
like his work?


340
0:14:48,6 --> 0:14:49,59
THOM DEVITA: I don't
like cartoons.


341
0:14:49,59 --> 0:14:51,32
NICK BUBASH: OK, all right.


342
0:14:51,32 --> 0:14:53,85
You don't like cartoons.


343
0:14:53,85 --> 0:14:57,1
I get the point.


344
0:14:57,1 --> 0:14:58,675
You didn't even like Al Capp?


345
0:14:58,675 --> 0:15:2,675
THOM DEVITA: Not even Al Capp.


346
0:15:2,675 --> 0:15:4,875
MALE SPEAKER: Do a lot of kids
skateboard past your--


347
0:15:4,875 --> 0:15:6,85
THOM DEVITA: No,
not that many.


348
0:15:6,85 --> 0:15:11,23
NICK BUBASH: Thom puts rocks out
there so they can't do it.


349
0:15:11,23 --> 0:15:13,17
THOM DEVITA: No, I
don't mind kids.


350
0:15:13,17 --> 0:15:15,0
It looks all right for kids.


351
0:15:15,0 --> 0:15:19,37
But for grownups to be on a
skateboard, it looks stupid.


352
0:15:19,37 --> 0:15:20,62
NICK BUBASH: Yeah.


353
0:15:20,62 --> 0:17:20,62
