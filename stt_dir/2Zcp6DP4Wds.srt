0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,91



2
0:0:4,91 --> 0:0:6,75
ATIBA JEFFERSON: There's
one other photo.


3
0:0:6,75 --> 0:0:7,72
Let's see.


4
0:0:7,72 --> 0:0:11,984
I can just bring it to you so
you don't have to move.


5
0:0:11,984 --> 0:0:15,8



6
0:0:15,8 --> 0:0:17,71
This one's just hilarious.


7
0:0:17,71 --> 0:0:20,39
So this is when I started
doing basketball shit.


8
0:0:20,39 --> 0:0:23,32



9
0:0:23,32 --> 0:0:24,9
We're big basketball fans.


10
0:0:24,9 --> 0:0:27,93
And at that time, I'd just
started shooting for the NBA


11
0:0:27,93 --> 0:0:29,85
and doing that stuff.


12
0:0:29,85 --> 0:0:33,55
So we are always hanging out.


13
0:0:33,55 --> 0:0:37,64
The third year, the Lakers
won the finals.


14
0:0:37,64 --> 0:0:40,11
I moved out here in 1995.


15
0:0:40,11 --> 0:0:42,69
I remember meeting Eric
at TransWorld.


16
0:0:42,69 --> 0:0:44,13
And I was just a filmer then.


17
0:0:44,13 --> 0:0:47,8
And I remember there was this
line in the TransWorld video


18
0:0:47,8 --> 0:0:50,64
where he does crook backside
180 on the table.


19
0:0:50,64 --> 0:0:52,66
And he just wasn't
happy with it.


20
0:0:52,66 --> 0:0:55,8
And I look back at it now,
and it's like, yeah.


21
0:0:55,8 --> 0:0:55,86
It was fine.


22
0:0:55,86 --> 0:0:56,49
But no.


23
0:0:56,49 --> 0:0:58,52
It was like a little tack.


24
0:0:58,52 --> 0:1:0,12
And that's why he was over it.


25
0:1:0,12 --> 0:1:1,66
And I was like, dude, that
was the gnarliest--


26
0:1:1,66 --> 0:1:3,93
like one of the gnarliest tri--
even to this day if


27
0:1:3,93 --> 0:1:8,21
people crook backside 180 the
hard way on the table, it's


28
0:1:8,21 --> 0:1:10,22
like insane.


29
0:1:10,22 --> 0:1:12,46
He's just always held
such a high level


30
0:1:12,46 --> 0:1:15,35
since I first met him.


31
0:1:15,35 --> 0:1:18,52
He's one of the first
pros that I shot.


32
0:1:18,52 --> 0:1:21,37
And it's funny because I'll
get, oh, the big time


33
0:1:21,37 --> 0:1:22,72
photographer.


34
0:1:22,72 --> 0:1:24,44
So much pressure shooting
with you.


35
0:1:24,44 --> 0:1:26,94
And I'm like, I'm gonna
blame that on Eric.


36
0:1:26,94 --> 0:1:29,33
Because I'm not a big
time photographer.


37
0:1:29,33 --> 0:1:31,35
I'm not this stressed
out dude.


38
0:1:31,35 --> 0:1:34,96
But people put me in that light
because I was shooting


39
0:1:34,96 --> 0:1:37,22
the greatest skater.


40
0:1:37,22 --> 0:1:38,56
I remember this.


41
0:1:38,56 --> 0:1:39,95
This always kind of
blew me away.


42
0:1:39,95 --> 0:1:42,1
Like when he kickflip blackslide
tailslid to this


43
0:1:42,1 --> 0:1:46,98
rail for Menikmati, it was light
speeds ahead of what


44
0:1:46,98 --> 0:1:48,36
people were kickflip
back tailing.


45
0:1:48,36 --> 0:1:52,31
And he did it so easy.


46
0:1:52,31 --> 0:1:56,4
I didn't get to skate with him
that much during Mouse.


47
0:1:56,4 --> 0:1:59,63
As soon as the Menikmati period
started, that's when I


48
0:1:59,63 --> 0:2:2,656
was skating with him a ton.


49
0:2:2,656 --> 0:2:4,59
ERIC KOSTON: I was like, yeah,
we're going to do a video.


50
0:2:4,59 --> 0:2:6,73
And I kind of was like, oh.


51
0:2:6,73 --> 0:2:7,28
All right.


52
0:2:7,28 --> 0:2:8,84
Maybe I'll start filming.


53
0:2:8,84 --> 0:2:12,78
And I kind of didn't take
it too seriously.


54
0:2:12,78 --> 0:2:14,26
Because it was always like
the board brands.


55
0:2:14,26 --> 0:2:14,69
You know what I mean?


56
0:2:14,69 --> 0:2:14,96
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


57
0:2:14,96 --> 0:2:17,51
ERIC KOSTON: That was kind of
the first shoe on in the one


58
0:2:17,51 --> 0:2:21,63
company that you really focused
on making it a really


59
0:2:21,63 --> 0:2:22,44
good part for.


60
0:2:22,44 --> 0:2:24,53
And then I think I got to
see some footage that


61
0:2:24,53 --> 0:2:25,56
everyone was doing.


62
0:2:25,56 --> 0:2:27,81
And I'm like, whoa, everyone's
really filming.


63
0:2:27,81 --> 0:2:30,0
Holy shit, I better get my
shit together and start


64
0:2:30,0 --> 0:2:31,15
filming that part.


65
0:2:31,15 --> 0:2:36,84
I don't want to be the slacker
who pulled it together.


66
0:2:36,84 --> 0:2:38,464
[APPLAUSE]


67
0:2:38,464 --> 0:2:42,63
ATIBA JEFFERSON: In Menikmati,
he's just destroying it.


68
0:2:42,63 --> 0:2:50,77
And being able to shoot Eric
Koston in Koston-mania phase


69
0:2:50,77 --> 0:2:52,65
was huge for my career.


70
0:2:52,65 --> 0:2:55,81
If I'm there shooting Eric,
nollie heelflip noseslide


71
0:2:55,81 --> 0:2:59,78
Wilshire 10, I'm the dude
that's there for that.


72
0:2:59,78 --> 0:3:2,24
Noseslide Hollywood Bowl.


73
0:3:2,24 --> 0:3:5,285
Eric gave me so many covers
in my career.


74
0:3:5,285 --> 0:3:6,66
MALE SPEAKER: What
are your favorite


75
0:3:6,66 --> 0:3:7,815
photos you shot of Koston?


76
0:3:7,815 --> 0:3:10,53
ATIBA JEFFERSON: Back
noseblunt bricktown.


77
0:3:10,53 --> 0:3:13,38
That, to me, is still
a gnarly trick.


78
0:3:13,38 --> 0:3:17,44



79
0:3:17,44 --> 0:3:18,49
[APPLAUSE]


80
0:3:18,49 --> 0:3:22,16
ATIBA JEFFERSON: And that was
a really magical time.


81
0:3:22,16 --> 0:3:26,565
That dude at that point
could not be stopped.


82
0:3:26,565 --> 0:3:28,87
TY EVANS: We were going
on Europe trips


83
0:3:28,87 --> 0:3:30,65
filming for Yeah Right!


84
0:3:30,65 --> 0:3:33,23
And we saw Eric out there with
Fred filming for Menikmati.


85
0:3:33,23 --> 0:3:36,25
I remember running into them
in Barcelona and stuff.


86
0:3:36,25 --> 0:3:39,25
I knew if I filmed anything
Eric, I knew it was going


87
0:3:39,25 --> 0:3:40,9
towards Menikmati.


88
0:3:40,9 --> 0:3:42,54
Because once he was done with
Menikmati, then all of his


89
0:3:42,54 --> 0:3:44,37
focus was gonna be towards
Yeah Right!


90
0:3:44,37 --> 0:3:46,33
I remember Atiba telling
me, oh, he


91
0:3:46,33 --> 0:3:48,46
backside noseblunted bricktown.


92
0:3:48,46 --> 0:3:49,37
I was like, oh, OK.


93
0:3:49,37 --> 0:3:49,845
He's got his ender.


94
0:3:49,845 --> 0:3:50,77
It's done.


95
0:3:50,77 --> 0:3:51,15
All right.


96
0:3:51,15 --> 0:3:52,1
Sick.


97
0:3:52,1 --> 0:3:52,69
Finally.


98
0:3:52,69 --> 0:3:54,83
We started filming
for Yeah Right!


99
0:3:54,83 --> 0:3:58,98
At the same time, Atiba and I,
and Lee, and Ako, we're like,


100
0:3:58,98 --> 0:3:59,83
let's make our own video.


101
0:3:59,83 --> 0:4:1,4
We're going to make
Chomp on This.


102
0:4:1,4 --> 0:4:4,3
And that just spawned into
this guy's coming on.


103
0:4:4,3 --> 0:4:5,401
This guy wants to
be part of it .


104
0:4:5,401 --> 0:4:5,68
This guy.


105
0:4:5,68 --> 0:4:6,98
And it just kind of
sort of grew.


106
0:4:6,98 --> 0:4:10,22
And then Eric, naturally,
was just in the mix.


107
0:4:10,22 --> 0:4:13,345
And it just turned into this
one big, weird thing.


108
0:4:13,345 --> 0:4:16,97
ATIBA JEFFERSON: It kind of
became the main focus for like


109
0:4:16,97 --> 0:4:18,13
six months.


110
0:4:18,13 --> 0:4:20,519
Like let's see what we can do.


111
0:4:20,519 --> 0:4:22,73
But at the same time, it
works perfect because


112
0:4:22,73 --> 0:4:24,55
Eric's warming up.


113
0:4:24,55 --> 0:4:27,546
And his warm-ups are good
enough for anything.


114
0:4:27,546 --> 0:4:30,49
ERIC KOSTON: And it wasn't
about me coming out this


115
0:4:30,49 --> 0:4:31,21
gnarly part.


116
0:4:31,21 --> 0:4:32,34
It was gonna be more fun.


117
0:4:32,34 --> 0:4:34,66
And I'd never really
filmed all the


118
0:4:34,66 --> 0:4:36,62
stuff when I fuck around.


119
0:4:36,62 --> 0:4:38,79
There'd be occasional things
here and there.


120
0:4:38,79 --> 0:4:41,57
I thought it would just be
kind of fun to just have


121
0:4:41,57 --> 0:4:43,33
everything.


122
0:4:43,33 --> 0:4:43,98
[INAUDIBLE]


123
0:4:43,98 --> 0:4:47,43
the wackiest shit that
I can kind of do.


124
0:4:47,43 --> 0:4:48,11
MALE SPEAKER: Mm-hmm.


125
0:4:48,11 --> 0:4:50,66
ERIC KOSTON: All into
the one part.


126
0:4:50,66 --> 0:4:52,17
MIKE CARROLL: That's one of
his fucking sickest parts


127
0:4:52,17 --> 0:4:53,82
right there, is Chomp on This.


128
0:4:53,82 --> 0:4:54,55
That's Eric.


129
0:4:54,55 --> 0:4:56,24
And that's him fucking around.


130
0:4:56,24 --> 0:4:57,2
And that's him.


131
0:4:57,2 --> 0:4:59,15
That's most of his
personality.


132
0:4:59,15 --> 0:5:3,16
It's not just stale and
just skateboarding.


133
0:5:3,16 --> 0:5:7,0
SAM SMYTH: If he wants to make
fun of some trick that


134
0:5:7,0 --> 0:5:11,19
somebody did, maybe worked
really hard at it and it was


135
0:5:11,19 --> 0:5:14,96
just fucking gross, he could
just do it first try.


136
0:5:14,96 --> 0:5:16,74
Just to make fun of it.


137
0:5:16,74 --> 0:5:18,94
He's just freestyling.


138
0:5:18,94 --> 0:5:21,27
Like rap freestyling,
but on board.


139
0:5:21,27 --> 0:5:23,43
A lot of that stuff in Chomp
where he's just dorking


140
0:5:23,43 --> 0:5:26,27
around, that's just
coming to him.


141
0:5:26,27 --> 0:5:29,3
ATIBA JEFFERSON: His Chomp part
on YouTube, it has like 1


142
0:5:29,3 --> 0:5:30,83
million views.


143
0:5:30,83 --> 0:5:33,5
That's a dork video part.


144
0:5:33,5 --> 0:5:36,18
The manual line, to me,
it's ridiculous.


145
0:5:36,18 --> 0:5:40,51
That just shows the skill level
of that dude is kind of


146
0:5:40,51 --> 0:5:44,0
beyond most skaters.


147
0:5:44,0 --> 0:5:46,4
MIKE CARROLL: He's just
an insane skater.


148
0:5:46,4 --> 0:5:49,73
So when he grew up, he learned
every fucking trick.


149
0:5:49,73 --> 0:5:50,86
He had those tricks.


150
0:5:50,86 --> 0:5:54,22
He just never put them in a
video part or anything.


151
0:5:54,22 --> 0:5:56,87
It's insane how much he can
just fuck around on


152
0:5:56,87 --> 0:5:59,8
skateboard.


153
0:5:59,8 --> 0:6:0,7
And just have fun.


154
0:6:0,7 --> 0:6:2,34
It's pretty fun.


155
0:6:2,34 --> 0:6:3,92
I get pretty jealous of that.


156
0:6:3,92 --> 0:6:10,108



157
0:6:10,108 --> 0:6:12,12
ERIC KOSTON: [YELLING]


158
0:6:12,12 --> 0:6:15,4
TY EVANS: The dude's capable of
doing so many cool things.


159
0:6:15,4 --> 0:6:19,8
And even for the video we're
working on now, Spike


160
0:6:19,8 --> 0:6:19,93
said it, I said it.


161
0:6:19,93 --> 0:6:21,73
We're all just like, dude,
do dork tricks.


162
0:6:21,73 --> 0:6:24,12
Don't even do the hardest,
newest trick.


163
0:6:24,12 --> 0:6:26,65
Just do like a cool, fun part.


164
0:6:26,65 --> 0:6:28,732
MALE SPEAKER: Does that stuff
come quick for him?


165
0:6:28,732 --> 0:6:30,74
TY EVANS: Back then it did.


166
0:6:30,74 --> 0:6:33,5
Back then all that
stuff was quick.


167
0:6:33,5 --> 0:6:34,98
ATIBA JEFFERSON: That
was such a fun time.


168
0:6:34,98 --> 0:6:36,82
And this point we were
all skating a lot.


169
0:6:36,82 --> 0:6:39,2
And I remember we were
on a trip in Miami.


170
0:6:39,2 --> 0:6:43,81
It was me, Eric, McCrank, Ty.


171
0:6:43,81 --> 0:6:45,96
And I remember it
was like, oh.


172
0:6:45,96 --> 0:6:48,32
If you guys aren't going
to get shit, we're


173
0:6:48,32 --> 0:6:49,96
going to get shit.


174
0:6:49,96 --> 0:6:52,59
And you're going to film us.


175
0:6:52,59 --> 0:6:54,8
MALE SPEAKER: Say something
to start off your section.


176
0:6:54,8 --> 0:6:57,5
ATIBA JEFFERSON: I'm not going
to have a section.


177
0:6:57,5 --> 0:6:58,39
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, see.


178
0:6:58,39 --> 0:6:59,77
That just started
it right there.


179
0:6:59,77 --> 0:7:3,68
ATIBA JEFFERSON: Eric filmed a
good amount of my video part.


180
0:7:3,68 --> 0:7:5,19
We're not good at skating.


181
0:7:5,19 --> 0:7:8,62
So a line is ours.


182
0:7:8,62 --> 0:7:11,91
And I remember Eric after
I finally made mine.


183
0:7:11,91 --> 0:7:13,54
He just lays on the
ground like, I'm


184
0:7:13,54 --> 0:7:15,73
gonna be so sore tomorrow.


185
0:7:15,73 --> 0:7:16,565
Like just miserable.


186
0:7:16,565 --> 0:7:17,792
[LAUGHTER]


187
0:7:17,792 --> 0:7:19,595
ATIBA JEFFERSON: I remember
being like, sorry, dude.


188
0:7:19,595 --> 0:7:19,85
Fuck.


189
0:7:19,85 --> 0:7:21,54
I fucked up Koston.


190
0:7:21,54 --> 0:7:24,71
ERIC KOSTON: I filmed a lot
of everybody else's parts.


191
0:7:24,71 --> 0:7:26,34
Like Ako's, and Atiba's,
and Ty's.


192
0:7:26,34 --> 0:7:27,4
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


193
0:7:27,4 --> 0:7:29,92
ERIC KOSTON: But it was
about those guys more.


194
0:7:29,92 --> 0:7:34,65
But it was just kind of the
bros and making it fun.


195
0:7:34,65 --> 0:7:36,9
TY EVANS: We all had little
handycams filming each other.


196
0:7:36,9 --> 0:7:37,96
And it was just like,
all right.


197
0:7:37,96 --> 0:7:40,87
Just make a fucking
stupid, fun video.


198
0:7:40,87 --> 0:7:42,24
I think that's what's
funny now is


199
0:7:42,24 --> 0:7:44,39
about with social media.


200
0:7:44,39 --> 0:7:48,61
Kids see every little thing
of any skater they


201
0:7:48,61 --> 0:7:49,21
want to know about.


202
0:7:49,21 --> 0:7:50,85
Or any person for that matter.


203
0:7:50,85 --> 0:7:53,75
Whereas back then, you didn't
see as much of people.


204
0:7:53,75 --> 0:7:57,23
So it's a video like Chomp kind
of had some more of that


205
0:7:57,23 --> 0:7:59,92
stuff that you normally
wouldn't see.


206
0:7:59,92 --> 0:8:3,33
We are all young, free-spirited,
drinking.


207
0:8:3,33 --> 0:8:4,7
No restrictions.


208
0:8:4,7 --> 0:8:7,555
Having fun.


209
0:8:7,555 --> 0:8:9,65
ATIBA JEFFERSON: Crips
and Bloods party.


210
0:8:9,65 --> 0:8:14,7
No one had wives, and kids, and
serious responsibilities.


211
0:8:14,7 --> 0:8:16,24
We were going out.


212
0:8:16,24 --> 0:8:18,7
All the party footage.


213
0:8:18,7 --> 0:8:21,7
The GG Allin footage.


214
0:8:21,7 --> 0:8:24,53
That's one of the funniest
Halloweens I've ever had.


215
0:8:24,53 --> 0:8:27,87
Anything with costume,
he killed it.


216
0:8:27,87 --> 0:8:30,665
This is the infamous GG night.


217
0:8:30,665 --> 0:8:33,2
Look at how young
everyone looks.


218
0:8:33,2 --> 0:8:34,539
He was GG Allin for
that Halloween.


219
0:8:34,539 --> 0:8:38,14
AARON MEZA: After that video
came out, I got a message from


220
0:8:38,14 --> 0:8:39,145
Jake Phelps.


221
0:8:39,145 --> 0:8:40,78
I forget what he said,
but he's like--


222
0:8:40,78 --> 0:8:43,169
he just went on a rant
about that video.


223
0:8:43,169 --> 0:8:45,16
He had just saw it.


224
0:8:45,16 --> 0:8:46,52
His shit's kinda weak.


225
0:8:46,52 --> 0:8:49,89
Then Koston's gonna be fucking
coming at GG like that.


226
0:8:49,89 --> 0:8:51,14
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


227
0:8:51,14 --> 0:8:54,983



228
0:8:54,983 --> 0:8:58,766
ERIC KOSTON: I fell
on my face.


229
0:8:58,766 --> 0:9:1,27
ATIBA JEFFERSON: It was super
fun because it started as like


230
0:9:1,27 --> 0:9:3,69
kind of this joke thing.


231
0:9:3,69 --> 0:9:5,875
And then it turned into,
let's do this video.


232
0:9:5,875 --> 0:9:10,15
And then it was like, let's get
the stickers and t-shirts.


233
0:9:10,15 --> 0:9:12,23
And those guys would put it on
their boards and wear it.


234
0:9:12,23 --> 0:9:15,4
It was kind of fun to sit back
and watch people really be


235
0:9:15,4 --> 0:9:16,25
like, what is this?


236
0:9:16,25 --> 0:9:17,59
Is this a new company?


237
0:9:17,59 --> 0:9:18,84
What is this gonna be?


238
0:9:18,84 --> 0:11:18,84
