1
0:0:2,23 --> 0:0:19,5
but it's the trees themselves that are
most in demand all around the world.


2
0:0:19,5 --> 0:0:22,64
Logging is one of the greatest threats
facing the world's rainforests.


3
0:0:22,64 --> 0:0:33,21
Yet there are a few places where
its effects are far less destructive.


4
0:0:33,21 --> 0:0:36,649
The jungles bordering India and Burma
are harvested


5
0:0:36,649 --> 0:0:39,989
using one of the most forest-friendly
methods of all.


6
0:0:39,989 --> 0:0:43,78
And it involves harnessing the raw power


7
0:0:43,78 --> 0:0:48,329
of the mightiest creature in the jungle.


8
0:0:48,329 --> 0:1:1,679
This is Ramprasad - five-and-a-half tonnes
of bull Asian elephant.


9
0:1:1,679 --> 0:1:6,87
And this is Sumir, his mahout.


10
0:1:6,87 --> 0:1:11,4
Before nightfall, they have to drag
a two-tonne log


11
0:1:11,4 --> 0:1:16,83
three kilometres out of the forest.


12
0:1:16,83 --> 0:1:20,12
Ramprasad is the mightiest elephant
in the camp,


13
0:1:20,12 --> 0:1:28,24
but it's still a mammoth test of
brute strength and communication.


14
0:1:28,24 --> 0:1:40,55
Sumir steers Ramprasad
with over 1 00 different commands.


15
0:1:40,55 --> 0:1:43,47
He can be operated in Hindi,
Assamese


16
0:1:43,47 --> 0:1:49,74
and he even understands
a little English.


17
0:1:49,74 --> 0:2:7,53
And Sumir's pretty fluent
in elephant too.


18
0:2:7,53 --> 0:2:10,439
Unbelievably strong
and surprisingly nimble,


19
0:2:10,439 --> 0:2:16,739
elephants are far superior to
logging machines in this tangled terrain.


20
0:2:16,739 --> 0:2:22,2
And most importantly, the forest
doesn't have to be completely cleared


21
0:2:22,2 --> 0:2:36,9
just to access a few selected trees.


22
0:2:36,9 --> 0:2:52,109
There's no need for expensive spare parts,


23
0:2:52,109 --> 0:2:58,239
and elephants run on 1 00% green fuel.


24
0:2:58,239 --> 0:3:6,98
But, unlike a machine,
Ramprasad has a mind of his own


25
0:3:6,98 --> 0:3:17,709
and must be treated with respect.


26
0:3:17,709 --> 0:3:23,109
It's essential to break elephants in
before they're put to work,


27
0:3:23,109 --> 0:3:24,9
but they're still wild at heart,


28
0:3:24,9 --> 0:3:29,42
and keeping control of such raw might
is a fine balancing act


29
0:3:29,42 --> 0:3:47,349
of command and compassion.


30
0:3:47,349 --> 0:3:50,659
Sumir and Ramprasad make it
to the collection site in good time


31
0:3:50,659 --> 0:3:57,1
and help load the trucks.


32
0:3:57,1 --> 0:3:59,1
Transporting logs to the sawmill


33
0:3:59,1 --> 0:4:4,109
is the only mechanised part
of the entire process.


34
0:4:4,109 --> 0:4:16,859
But they're not out of the woods yet.


35
0:4:16,859 --> 0:4:33,91
Once again, underjungle conditions,
elephants out-perform engines.


36
0:4:33,91 --> 0:4:41,8
Job done, time for a well-earned wash.


37
0:4:41,8 --> 0:4:47,3
The jungles of East India and Burma


38
0:4:47,3 --> 0:4:51,11
form the largest area of rainforest
left in Asia


39
0:4:51,11 --> 0:5:1,78
and provide sanctuary for the last
healthy population of Asian elephants.


40
0:5:1,78 --> 0:5:5,29
Ramprasad and these other elephants
have lost their freedom,


41
0:5:5,29 --> 0:5:11,41
but this way of logging helps secure
the future of their species


42
0:5:11,41 --> 0:5:15,25
and their home.


43
0:5:15,25 --> 0:5:17,7
It's through partnerships with nature


44
0:5:17,7 --> 0:5:26,1
that people manage to live within
the jungle without destroying it.


45
0:5:26,1 --> 0:5:34,26
But in most areas of tropical rainforest,
the picture is not so harmonious.


46
0:5:34,26 --> 0:5:50,85
In just 50 years, half the planet's
tropical forest has been cleared.


47
0:5:50,85 --> 0:5:54,66
As many as 1 00 rainforest species
go extinct every day...


48
0:5:54,66 --> 0:6:6,49
...often before
they've even been discovered.


49
0:6:6,49 --> 0:6:9,23
And it's not just animals and plants.


50
0:6:9,23 --> 0:6:15,33
We're also losing human cultures
that we know almost nothing about.


51
0:6:15,33 --> 0:6:22,4
Even in the 2 1st century,


52
0:6:22,4 --> 0:6:26,98
there are still people who exist
in isolation from the rest of humanity,


53
0:6:26,98 --> 0:6:34,65
and virtually all live in jungles.


54
0:6:34,65 --> 0:6:39,22
These vast, unexplored forests
are the only places left on Earth


55
0:6:39,22 --> 0:6:44,85
where entire communities
can live undetected.


56
0:6:44,85 --> 0:6:49,25
Brazil is thought to be home
to around 70 isolated tribes,


57
0:6:49,25 --> 0:6:55,41
around two-thirds of the world total.


58
0:6:55,41 --> 0:6:57,51
Jose Carlos Meirelles works for FUNAI,


59
0:6:57,51 --> 0:7:2,79
a government agency that protects
Brazil's indigenous people.


60
0:7:2,79 --> 0:7:9,53
Today he's hoping to encounter
one of these uncontacted tribes.


61
0:7:9,53 --> 0:7:35,11
He needs to get to them
before others do.


62
0:7:35,11 --> 0:7:37,9
Logging and mining
are encroaching on these forests


63
0:7:37,9 --> 0:7:39,73
and there are some who want to deny


64
0:7:39,73 --> 0:7:48,19
that uncontacted tribes
live here at all.


65
0:7:48,19 --> 0:7:54,75
Meirelles needs evidence.


66
0:7:54,75 --> 0:8:8,56
The fight to protect these people


67
0:8:8,56 --> 0:8:29,59
depends upon proving
and publicising their existence.


68
0:8:29,59 --> 0:8:53,399
This is the very first aerial footage
of an uncontacted community.


69
0:8:53,399 --> 0:8:56,769
Very little is known about their
way of life or even their language,


70
0:8:56,769 --> 0:9:6,74
and Meirelles would rather
it stays that way.


71
0:9:6,74 --> 0:9:11,509
He's dedicated 40 years to protecting
isolated tribes from the outside world,


72
0:9:11,509 --> 0:9:37,24
but this isn't as simple
as just leaving them alone.


73
0:9:37,24 --> 0:9:39,269
Using a stabilised zoom lens,


74
0:9:39,269 --> 0:9:42,339
it was possible to film
from a kilometre away,


75
0:9:42,339 --> 0:9:44,839
minimising disturbance.


76
0:9:44,839 --> 0:9:50,139
Meirelles believes the more people
are aware these tribes are here,


77
0:9:50,139 --> 0:10:32,949
the more effective the fight
to preserve their way of life.


78
0:10:32,949 --> 0:10:37,22
Humans have survived here
by becoming part of the forest,


79
0:10:37,22 --> 0:10:38,939
but it's this specialisation


80
0:10:38,939 --> 0:10:44,889
that leaves them so vulnerable
in these changing times.


81
0:10:44,889 --> 0:10:57,3
These people are the guardians of
a wealth of knowledge and skill


82
0:10:57,3 --> 0:11:7,249
that enable humans to forge a life
within the natural world.


83
0:11:7,249 --> 0:11:9,999
And there are very few
whose existence remains


84
0:11:9,999 --> 0:11:12,74
as intimately connected
with the rainforest


85
0:11:12,74 --> 0:11:26,8
as the remote tribes of West Papua.


86
0:11:26,8 --> 0:11:34,569
The Korowai are so adapted to life in
the jungle, they've taken to the trees.


87
0:11:34,569 --> 0:11:38,3
(SHOUTING)


88
0:11:38,3 --> 0:11:41,639
This clan is building a new house...


89
0:11:41,639 --> 0:11:43,1
(SHOUTING)


90
0:11:43,1 --> 0:11:53,319
...but it will be no ordinary one.


91
0:11:53,319 --> 0:11:56,629
All materials must be sourced on site,


92
0:11:56,629 --> 0:12:5,249
and much of the cutting is still done
using stone-age tools.


93
0:12:5,249 --> 0:12:7,22
It's an ambitious project.


94
0:12:7,22 --> 0:12:18,399
The plan is to build their new home
in a tree 35 metres up.


95
0:12:18,399 --> 0:12:21,74
Just as well they've chosen an ironwood,


96
0:12:21,74 --> 0:12:25,339
the strongest tree in the forest.


97
0:12:25,339 --> 0:12:42,59
The first step is to build
a ladder to its crown.


98
0:12:42,59 --> 0:12:46,92
These are the only tribes in the world
who live in tree houses...


99
0:12:46,92 --> 0:12:55,72
...and they do so for a number of reasons.


100
0:12:55,72 --> 0:13:1,459
It's an escape from the floods and
the biting insects on the forest floor.


101
0:13:1,459 --> 0:13:3,86
It offers protection
from enemy attack,


102
0:13:3,86 --> 0:13:7,86
but most of all, it's a display
of theirjungle prowess.


103
0:13:7,86 --> 0:13:26,699
For the Korowai, the higher the house,
the greater the prestige.


104
0:13:26,699 --> 0:13:29,4
The Korowai's skills may be exceptional,


105
0:13:29,4 --> 0:13:43,17
but builders are the same the world over.


106
0:13:43,17 --> 0:13:45,67
As one of the clan's
strongest climbers,


107
0:13:45,67 --> 0:14:2,689
Wayo is the foreman overseeing
the most dangerous jobs.


108
0:14:2,689 --> 0:14:10,769
Thinning the branches keeps the house
from shaking apart in the wind.


109
0:14:10,769 --> 0:14:17,199
A fall would mean certain death,


110
0:14:17,199 --> 0:14:32,86
but teetering in tree-tops
is second nature to the Korowai.


111
0:14:32,86 --> 0:14:41,829
(WHOOPING)


112
0:14:41,829 --> 0:14:50,42
As the house goes up,
more trees come down.


113
0:14:50,42 --> 0:16:50,42
But they have to fall
in the right direction.
