1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:18,78



2
0:0:18,78 --> 0:0:20,22
My name is Nicholas Forker.


3
0:0:20,22 --> 0:0:21,72
I make drawings and
sculptures.


4
0:0:21,72 --> 0:0:29,87



5
0:0:29,87 --> 0:0:35,28
I encounter so many people who
feel kind of listless and just


6
0:0:35,28 --> 0:0:38,52
misplaced or apathetic, and I
was trying to answer that


7
0:0:38,52 --> 0:0:41,56
question, why do my
contemporaries


8
0:0:41,56 --> 0:0:43,92
feel so out of sorts?


9
0:0:43,92 --> 0:0:46,69
So I started to turn towards
when men felt vital.


10
0:0:46,69 --> 0:0:50,17
The heroic roles, the classic
things like the deep sea


11
0:0:50,17 --> 0:0:54,83
diver, the cowboy, the
Arctic explorer.


12
0:0:54,83 --> 0:0:59,3
Well, then I drew a cosmonaut,
and it kind of all clicked


13
0:0:59,3 --> 0:1:0,19
into place.


14
0:1:0,19 --> 0:1:4,6
Here was this subject that
made perfect sense--


15
0:1:4,6 --> 0:1:11,1
the explorer, the hero role,
which turned out to be more of


16
0:1:11,1 --> 0:1:15,44
a metaphor for the trajectory
of the American male in the


17
0:1:15,44 --> 0:1:19,4
late 20th century.


18
0:1:19,4 --> 0:1:21,24
I think that it's become
more of like a Don


19
0:1:21,24 --> 0:1:22,44
Quixote figure, though.


20
0:1:22,44 --> 0:1:23,19
Now, anyway.


21
0:1:23,19 --> 0:1:27,97
With the space program being
pushed into the private sector


22
0:1:27,97 --> 0:1:33,64
and NASA's funding getting cut
dramatically, we're seeing


23
0:1:33,64 --> 0:1:35,34
that dream kind of fizzle.


24
0:1:35,34 --> 0:1:37,78
And we've gone from--


25
0:1:37,78 --> 0:1:41,14
right, we're going to do these
things because they're hard,


26
0:1:41,14 --> 0:1:45,16
to like a mess, really.


27
0:1:45,16 --> 0:1:55,24



28
0:1:55,24 --> 0:2:0,73
The idea to wear the suit was
seeing the use of the


29
0:2:0,73 --> 0:2:4,9
astronaut as my main figure.


30
0:2:4,9 --> 0:2:8,58
It was seeing that idea to
a logical conclusion.


31
0:2:8,58 --> 0:2:13,48
I was able to borrow a suit, and
it was an exact replica of


32
0:2:13,48 --> 0:2:18,26
Buzz Aldrin's lunar landing
suit from '69.


33
0:2:18,26 --> 0:2:21,68
And my very talented friend
Clint Spaulding came along to


34
0:2:21,68 --> 0:2:26,29
shoot some photos, a series of
photos of me in the suit.


35
0:2:26,29 --> 0:2:29,3
The original idea was to take
all of the photos, reference


36
0:2:29,3 --> 0:2:32,48
material, create realistic
drawings of them.


37
0:2:32,48 --> 0:2:37,69
But the performance aspect of,
like, embodying the astronaut,


38
0:2:37,69 --> 0:2:43,99
that idea of the self-portrait
as the subject, now I'm


39
0:2:43,99 --> 0:2:46,935
thinking that the photographs
might stand on their own.


40
0:2:46,935 --> 0:2:57,17



41
0:2:57,17 --> 0:2:59,817
The reason why space is so
fascinating to me is because


42
0:2:59,817 --> 0:3:3,2
of its unknown quantity.


43
0:3:3,2 --> 0:3:6,12
It's more about space, to
me, than the astronaut.


44
0:3:6,12 --> 0:3:9,66
Because the astronaut
is only a symbol.


45
0:3:9,66 --> 0:3:12,26
It's a symbol of our attempt,
our kind of frail human


46
0:3:12,26 --> 0:3:15,85
attempt, to thrust ourselves
into something that we know


47
0:3:15,85 --> 0:3:18,6
nothing about.


48
0:3:18,6 --> 0:3:21,19
The feeling that I would
experience in space would be


49
0:3:21,19 --> 0:3:21,885
peace and quiet.


50
0:3:21,885 --> 0:3:26,38
It would be a refreshing
change of pace.


51
0:3:26,38 --> 0:3:29,29
That would quickly give
way to loneliness


52
0:3:29,29 --> 0:3:30,78
and madness, probably.


53
0:3:30,78 --> 0:3:35,52



54
0:3:35,52 --> 0:3:39,2
When I walked around in this
suit, I felt that it was the


55
0:3:39,2 --> 0:3:45,32
embodiment of that left-hand
path, the life of the artist.


56
0:3:45,32 --> 0:3:46,28
It's monastic.


57
0:3:46,28 --> 0:3:47,92
You spend most of
your time alone.


58
0:3:47,92 --> 0:3:50,48
When you do you open your mouth,
you find that either


59
0:3:50,48 --> 0:3:52,85
you don't understand what people
are saying to you, or


60
0:3:52,85 --> 0:3:54,38
they don't understand what
you're saying to them.


61
0:3:54,38 --> 0:4:12,23



62
0:4:12,23 --> 0:4:15,65
So many different people tried
to make the space suit, and it


63
0:4:15,65 --> 0:4:18,589
was Playtex that got the
contract for the space suit


64
0:4:18,589 --> 0:4:20,26
for the Apollo mission.


65
0:4:20,26 --> 0:4:24,88
It was because of their
knowledge of fabrics that they


66
0:4:24,88 --> 0:4:27,555
were able to weave together,
like, I don't know-- it was


67
0:4:27,555 --> 0:4:34,13
like 13 to 20 different types of
materials to make the space


68
0:4:34,13 --> 0:4:36,23
suit that they landed
on the moon with.


69
0:4:36,23 --> 0:4:38,82
It's just a really fascinating
idea that you could come up


70
0:4:38,82 --> 0:4:42,86
with essentially what is like a
plastic bag and jump into it


71
0:4:42,86 --> 0:4:44,39
and go into space.


72
0:4:44,39 --> 0:4:47,6
It represents the fragility
of human life.


73
0:4:47,6 --> 0:4:57,33



74
0:4:57,33 --> 0:5:4,9
This work is an example of
relating that human experience


75
0:5:4,9 --> 0:5:7,14
in the later half of the 20th
century in the United States.


76
0:5:7,14 --> 0:5:9,44
It's like, I can only speak
from my experience.


77
0:5:9,44 --> 0:5:11,26
These are the experiences
I have.


78
0:5:11,26 --> 0:5:18,27
It says, take the most
triumphant hero and watch what


79
0:5:18,27 --> 0:5:21,13
happens after nobody cares
about them anymore.


80
0:5:21,13 --> 0:5:24,93



81
0:5:24,93 --> 0:5:31,25
The dinosaur that is fine art
is quickly being replaced by


82
0:5:31,25 --> 0:5:33,82
this multimedia explosion.


83
0:5:33,82 --> 0:5:37,14
Like, just all your synapses
are filled with digital


84
0:5:37,14 --> 0:5:38,11
information constantly.


85
0:5:38,11 --> 0:5:41,97
Well, how do you make a
two-dimensional static image


86
0:5:41,97 --> 0:5:44,15
that is captivating?


87
0:5:44,15 --> 0:5:46,9
I thought on that long and hard,
and I think one of the


88
0:5:46,9 --> 0:5:49,47
ways to do it is to demonstrate
a skill, something


89
0:5:49,47 --> 0:5:51,35
that can't be done on
the computer, with


90
0:5:51,35 --> 0:5:53,2
an app on your phone.


91
0:5:53,2 --> 0:5:56,79
Do it with materials that are
really difficult to work with,


92
0:5:56,79 --> 0:5:58,86
that people wouldn't think
about combining.


93
0:5:58,86 --> 0:6:2,54
The ballpoint, the Mylar,
drawing on plastic.


94
0:6:2,54 --> 0:6:6,0
Take something that has to do
with the essence of your


95
0:6:6,0 --> 0:6:8,92
experience as a person, as a
human being, everything that


96
0:6:8,92 --> 0:6:11,81
you've done, everything that
you've seen, everything that


97
0:6:11,81 --> 0:6:14,84
you've thought of, everything
that you've been exposed to--


98
0:6:14,84 --> 0:6:18,17
and condense all of that
into one image.


99
0:6:18,17 --> 0:6:26,96



100
0:6:26,96 --> 0:6:29,86
I chose the astronaut
because as a


101
0:6:29,86 --> 0:6:31,95
symbol, it's very powerful.


102
0:6:31,95 --> 0:6:33,91
It speaks of a specific
point in time.


103
0:6:33,91 --> 0:6:36,48
It speaks of a specific
place in time.


104
0:6:36,48 --> 0:6:38,38
It talks about dreams.


105
0:6:38,38 --> 0:6:39,24
It talks about hopes.


106
0:6:39,24 --> 0:6:40,37
It talks about aspirations.


107
0:6:40,37 --> 0:6:44,8
It talks about realistic
implication of those things.


108
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:45,99
It talks about successes
and failures.


109
0:6:45,99 --> 0:6:51,68
It talks about the human mind,
space as this infinitely large


110
0:6:51,68 --> 0:6:55,24
representation of something
that is infinitely small,


111
0:6:55,24 --> 0:6:56,61
contained in all of us.


112
0:6:56,61 --> 0:7:3,4
The artwork, for me, is about
highlighting that last stage


113
0:7:3,4 --> 0:7:8,56
in the adventurer, the person
who is the frontiersperson.


114
0:7:8,56 --> 0:7:10,86
I think that role,
or the landscape


115
0:7:10,86 --> 0:7:11,93
for that, has changed.


116
0:7:11,93 --> 0:7:14,31
I think that that has to do with
our own brain, our own


117
0:7:14,31 --> 0:7:17,47
consciousness, and the way
we affect our reality.


118
0:7:17,47 --> 0:7:21,87
So for me, this is more like
putting up a signpost and


119
0:7:21,87 --> 0:7:23,59
saying, like, this
is where it's at.


120
0:7:23,59 --> 0:7:26,95
And I'm looking forward to
possible replacements.


121
0:7:26,95 --> 0:9:26,95
