###12 FRANK CASTRONOVO: But we're getting our After A Hard Day's
###15 Work drink.
###17 I think we should put some of these in our pockets, because
###18 when we leave here, we won't be able to get that anymore.
###21 FRANK FALCINELLI: I've got a denim jacket that has pockets
###23 on the inside.
###24 FRANK CASTRONOVO: I brought my jacket with all the pockets so
###25 I can put shit in there.
###26 This is Frank Castronovo of Frankies Spuntino.
###31 Do you want to do that?
###32 FRANK FALCINELLI: Frank Falcinelli.
###34 Frank Castronovo.
###35 
###37 All right.
###38 Here we go.
###39 
###44 Our idea, our concept was just to attract the least amount of
###48 attention as possible.
###49 That was pretty much it.
###50 FRANK CASTRONOVO: We kind of fly under the radar.
###52 FRANK FALCINELLI: Yeah, be out in Brooklyn and just fix up a
###55 place nice and get back to the stuff that we ate
###57 when we were kids.
###59 In chronological order, our restaurants are Frankies
###62 Spuntino on Court Street, Frankies Spuntino on Clinton
###66 Street, Cafe Pedlar, Prime Meats right next to us on 465
###71 Court Street.
###71 FRANK CASTRONOVO: Last but not least.
###72 FRANK FALCINELLI: Last but not least.
###73 We're in Carroll Gardens heading over to Roberta's.
###78 FRANK CASTRONOVO: When you want to feel relaxed, you want
###80 to just kick back your feet, take off your shoes.
###87 FRANK FALCINELLI: Roll something delicious.
###89 FRANK CASTRONOVO: We're going to spread
###90 the joy and the cheer.
###92 They've got sick pizza here, man.
###93 
###108 FRANK FALCINELLI: Cheer's man.
###110 FRANK CASTRONOVO: Prost.
###111 -The Frankie story?
###112 Well, these two guys grew up together in Queens.
###115 FRANK CASTRONOVO: Probably like 13.
###116 FRANK FALCINELLI: Yeah, 12, 13 years old.
###118 FRANK CASTRONOVO: Frank went to culinary school like right
###120 after high school.
###121 And I ran into him.
###122 And I was like, where are you at, man?
###124 And he was like, I'm working at Maxines.
###125 And I was like, fuck, I've got to get out of Queens, man.
###129 How the fuck am I going to get out of here?
###130 And he's like, oh yeah you travel a lot.
###134 You could be a chef.
###135 You could work in any country in the world.
###136 And I always loved to travel and go places and that was
###140 like my ticket.
###141 Thinking someday, you know I've got to do something.
###144 Why don't I open a restaurant?
###147 I love to eat.
###147 I go to everybody's house to eat, man.
###150 I was invited to everybody's lunch and
###152 everybody's dinner, man.
###153 I thought I was going to be 55 years old and have a little
###156 restaurant with my wife and my kids.
###159 And we were just going to have a little thing.
###161 And Frank said, uh uh.
###161 It's happening now.
###162 We're doing it now.
###164 Whoa.
###167 FRANK FALCINELLI: The one thing that's awesome about
###170 being in the restaurant business and coming to
###173 restaurants, you can order like a salad and then you get
###175 40 entrees.
###177 If you're working like 90 hours and you're incessantly
###182 worrying about your business, the least you can do is go to
###185 another restaurant and get a bunch of free shit.
###188 This is like restaurant merch.
###190 They are like, hey, have another one of my t-shirts.
###191 
###196 FRANK FALCINELLI: But we've got to go
###197 outside and smoke, man.
###198 Where's that smoke coming from, man?
###201 Oh, my goodness.
###202 And Roberta's crew has now ingested more THC than they've
###206 ever ingested.
###207 So, we're going to see Mathieu at Motorino now.
###210 
###214 MATHIEU PALOMBINO: Welcome to Motorino.
###216 And it's a great honor to have the Frankies here.
###222 FRANK CASTRONOVO: Mathieu from Motorino--
###226 FRANK FALCINELLI: Is a classically trained chef.
###228 FRANK CASTRONOVO: He's like us.
###228 He's more of a classically trained chef.
###230 We talk food.
###231 And he knows more than just making pizza.
###235 And he's also similar to us starting out.
###238 Just kind of doing like very simple things, but doing them
###241 really well.
###242 Just focusing on the quality of the product and not trying
###245 to do everything that he knows.
###247 FRANK FALCINELLI: We share the same hospitality aesthetic
###249 that we have as far as really making people feel
###252 comfortable.
###254 A little bit more than buying them a drink type of thing.
###256 It's just real, you know--
###258 you feel like you want to be part of that.
###259 And they want to be part of your life while you're there
###262 and away from there.
###263 And it's just a bond that carries on.
###265 They call it roasted mortadella,
###267 but it's fried baloney.
###269 It is.
###270 That's fried fucking baloney.
###271 
###275 Yep.
###275 He throws the kitchen sink at you.
###277 That's the shit right there.
###278 
###287 We're definitely doing a lot of different projects.
###288 But we're trying to keep the pace steady and even.
###291 "The Frankies Spuntino Kitchen Companion and Cooking Manual."
###295 That's going to be out in June.
###297 Somebody's got to be interested in how to make the
###299 damn gnocchi or how to make the cavatelli or how to make
###302 the white onion dressing.
###304 It stays true to the fact that it is a cooking manual.
###306 It's meant to stay on the kitchen counter at all times
###309 so that's your go-to book.
###310 Getting down with some delicious, delicious--
###312 Cheers.
###315 Cheers man.
###318 FRANK CASTRONOVO: We're leaving Williamsburg.
###320 And we're heading back to Carroll Gardens.
###323 FRANK FALCINELLI: We kidnapped Mathieu.
###325 
###331 The menu is very solid.
###334 And all the dishes--
###335 when you take a dish off, you get like an uproar and say,
###338 why are you taking that out?
###340 Something basic, like our meatballs.
###343 That's everything everybody wants
###345 to know about, meatballs.
###346 So let's make a meatball.
###348 It can't be that hard.
###350 
###354 FRANK CASTRONOVO: We're doing meatballs Frankie style.
###358 FRANK FALCINELLI: Parsley.
###359 
###365 OK, two cups of bread.
###366 
###372 Plenty.
###374 
###383 FRANK CASTRONOVO: We're making meatballs.
###386 That is some nice looking browning Frank Falcinelli.
###391 You have to nice and slowly brown everything with a lot of
###394 love and care.
###395 Tell you, chefs are like, don't cook with olive oil,
###398 don't cook high-- yeah, you don't go over a certain
###400 temperature.
###401 Keep it like at 110, 120 like Frank's doing right now.
###406 All right, Frank.
###406 Let's go grab a bottle of wine.
###407 
###416 FRANK FALCINELLI: Um, let me read French braille.
###418 Yes, it's very easy in braille.
###419 Ooh, yeah.
###421 FRANK CASTRONOVO: So, bascailly, this is more like a
###423 hamburger in tomato sauce with garlic and Parmesan cheese.
###430 It's really tasty like that.
###432 So, here we go.
###434 
###436 Now, you can see the meat just reached tempreture, so it's
###439 still really tender.
###441 You just put a little sauce around it.
###443 Put sauce on top of it.
###445 Put a little cheese on that.
###447 FRANK FALCINELLI: It looks good, man.
###448 FRANK CASTRONOVO: It's fresh.
###448 It just got cooked.
###450 
###457 Holy shit.
###459 
###462 You know people here say, he's a fucking cook.
###466 Or that's all he does, but it's a lot more
###469 serious than that.
###470 We're putting food in people's mouths.
###473 And It's not really about how great we can be and how
###476 popular we can be and how much money we can make.
###478 It's really about truly believing that what you're
###481 doing is something good and what you're doing
###483 is the right thing.
###485 Because when you die and you're done, you're not taking
###489 anything with you except what you did with your soul, how
###492 you enriched it.
###493 And that's why I always feel like what I'm doing is good
###496 and right and true.
###498 Truthfully, I'd love to go out being known as like be
###503 Grateful Dead of food.
###506 That would be like my ultimate.
###511 That's what we're trying to do here.
###513 You came just in time for the final doobie, man.
###516
