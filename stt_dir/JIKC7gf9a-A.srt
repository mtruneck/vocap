1
0:0:36,48 --> 0:0:38,949
I know I am
I'm sure I am


2
0:0:38,949 --> 0:0:46,89
I'm West Ham till I die


3
0:0:46,89 --> 0:0:55,198
Go on, bruv. Go on, bruv.


4
0:0:55,198 --> 0:0:56,667
Fuck me.


5
0:0:56,667 --> 0:0:58,735
If I knew we was
going to a bar mitzvah...


6
0:0:58,735 --> 0:1:1,605
...I would have brought me
fucking skullcap.


7
0:1:1,605 --> 0:1:3,707
Mate, Tottenham's due north.


8
0:1:3,707 --> 0:1:7,144
Are you lost? Or just fucking stupid?


9
0:1:7,144 --> 0:1:9,713
- Still a stand-up comedian, eh, Dunham?
- Oh, shut up.


10
0:1:9,713 --> 0:1:12,115
All right, mate.
You know, back when the Major...


11
0:1:12,115 --> 0:1:14,618
...was doing your job,
he wasn't nearly so chatty.


12
0:1:14,618 --> 0:1:17,988
Probably because he wasn't
quite so nervous either.


13
0:1:17,988 --> 0:1:21,425
Yeah, the Major always preferred
a scrap to your yammer.


14
0:1:21,425 --> 0:1:23,994
- What's all that? What is that?
- Yammer?


15
0:1:23,994 --> 0:1:25,429
- You reckon?
- Yeah.


16
0:1:25,429 --> 0:1:29,733
Mate, I think you should get on
the next train and fuck off out of here.


17
0:1:29,733 --> 0:1:33,7
Before something bad happens.


18
0:1:33,7 --> 0:1:36,6
Maybe we'll be interested
to see exactly what that is.


19
0:1:36,6 --> 0:1:38,642
You're not exactly top-flight mob
these days, are you?


20
0:1:38,642 --> 0:1:41,778
Hey? More like a two-bob mob.


21
0:1:41,778 --> 0:1:44,848
See? Now that's just plain rude.


22
0:1:44,848 --> 0:1:54,91
But, hey, if you fancy it,
who are we to let you down?


23
0:1:54,91 --> 0:3:12,836
You fucking cunt. You.


24
0:3:12,836 --> 0:3:16,373
Let's go.


25
0:3:16,373 --> 0:3:18,875
I'm telling you, you don't need Lewis.


26
0:3:18,875 --> 0:3:23,58
No, I know-- Look, I will trade you
Keyshawn and Maddox for Lewis.


27
0:3:23,58 --> 0:3:26,83
- Maddox?
- And I'm gonna be losing out on this deal.


28
0:3:26,83 --> 0:3:28,285
Because Keyshawn, he's back with the--


29
0:3:28,285 --> 0:3:30,954
He's back with the old coach.
He's back with Parcells.


30
0:3:30,954 --> 0:3:38,662
And they are gonna be an unstoppable team.
You know that. I know that.


31
0:3:38,662 --> 0:3:42,332
Hey, look, man,
he was comeback player of the year.


32
0:3:42,332 --> 0:3:47,17
You know? Not many guys have thrown
over 6000 yards.


33
0:3:47,17 --> 0:3:51,408
Come on, you--


34
0:3:51,408 --> 0:3:54,377
Look, let me call you back.
I gotta deal with something.


35
0:3:54,377 --> 0:3:57,514
All right, but I--


36
0:3:57,514 --> 0:4:0,283
Buckner.


37
0:4:0,283 --> 0:4:3,62
That's $10,000,
I think it's a pretty good deal.


38
0:4:3,62 --> 0:4:9,459
We never had a deal, Jeremy.


39
0:4:9,459 --> 0:4:12,429
Look. I know you got screwed here.


40
0:4:12,429 --> 0:4:15,765
But I have my family's reputation
to protect.


41
0:4:15,765 --> 0:4:19,87
I mean, a Van Holden getting expelled
from Harvard.


42
0:4:19,87 --> 0:4:21,671
There's no way.


43
0:4:21,671 --> 0:4:24,774
I've got a little more
at stake here, Matt.


44
0:4:24,774 --> 0:4:27,41
Buckner?


45
0:4:27,41 --> 0:4:29,646
Come on, man.


46
0:4:29,646 --> 0:4:31,848
My dad is definitely gonna get re-elected.


47
0:4:31,848 --> 0:4:39,122
When I graduate, I'll totally hook you up.


48
0:4:39,122 --> 0:4:48,465
Thanks, bro.


49
0:4:48,465 --> 0:5:24,367
You're really saving my ass.


50
0:5:24,367 --> 0:5:25,969
You've reached Carl Buckner.


51
0:5:25,969 --> 0:5:29,239
I'm currently on assignment in Kabul,
and I'm unreachable.


52
0:5:29,239 --> 0:5:32,75
Leave a message with
the Foreign Correspondence Desk...


53
0:5:32,75 --> 0:5:34,444
...of the Washington Bureau
of the Times...


54
0:5:34,444 --> 0:6:19,623
...and I will get back to you
as soon as possible. Thanks so much.


55
0:6:19,623 --> 0:6:23,56
This is a security announcement
at Heathrow Airport.


56
0:6:23,56 --> 0:6:28,31
Please keep your belongings
with you at all times.


57
0:6:28,31 --> 0:6:32,35
My name is Matt Buckner.
Last spring, I got kicked out of Harvard...


58
0:6:32,35 --> 0:6:35,672
...two months shy of my diploma.
But what I was about to learn...


59
0:6:35,672 --> 0:8:4,27
...no Ivy-League school in the world
could teach me.


60
0:8:4,27 --> 0:8:9,265
Mind the gap.
Please stand clear of the closing doors.


61
0:8:9,265 --> 0:8:29,185
Mind the gap.
Please stand clear.


62
0:8:29,185 --> 0:8:30,353
All right.


63
0:8:30,353 --> 0:8:35,525
Matt?


64
0:8:35,525 --> 0:8:37,727
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey.


65
0:8:37,727 --> 0:8:40,296
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, it's so good to see you.


66
0:8:40,296 --> 0:8:44,33
You too. Was there a terrorist attack?
What happened here?


67
0:8:44,33 --> 0:8:47,67
Oh, welcome to match-day madness.
Tottenham was in town last night.


68
0:8:47,67 --> 0:8:49,72
Are you a soccer fan now?


69
0:8:49,72 --> 0:8:51,741
Don't let them hear you
say the word "soccer."


70
0:8:51,741 --> 0:8:55,44
- Who's them?
- The British Empire.


71
0:8:55,44 --> 0:8:58,448
Uncle Matt, meet Ben.


72
0:8:58,448 --> 0:9:0,85
- Can you believe that?
- Hey there, little guy.


73
0:9:0,85 --> 0:9:4,654
- He's adorable.
- Yeah.


74
0:9:4,654 --> 0:9:13,229
It is so good to see you.
But what are you doing here?


75
0:9:13,229 --> 0:9:15,131
It just doesn't make any sense, Matt.


76
0:9:15,131 --> 0:9:19,836
Why would you have been expelled
if you didn't do anything wrong?


77
0:9:19,836 --> 0:9:23,6
It was my roommate.
He's a total cokehead.


78
0:9:23,6 --> 0:9:27,76
Somebody tipped off campus security
and we got our room searched.


79
0:9:27,76 --> 0:9:29,979
They found his stash in my stuff.


80
0:9:29,979 --> 0:9:33,817
I guess he'd been hiding his shit
in my closet the entire time.


81
0:9:33,817 --> 0:9:36,686
Really?


82
0:9:36,686 --> 0:9:38,555
Yeah. Really.


83
0:9:38,555 --> 0:9:41,57
No, I mean, you could tell me
if you were taking--


84
0:9:41,57 --> 0:9:46,196
- It's not like that.
- You fought it and they didn't believe you?


85
0:9:46,196 --> 0:9:48,164
Matt?


86
0:9:48,164 --> 0:9:50,5
You fought it, right?


87
0:9:50,5 --> 0:9:53,603
Look, you don't know who this guy is.


88
0:9:53,603 --> 0:9:56,206
He's a Van Holden.


89
0:9:56,206 --> 0:10:0,51
I wouldn't have even had a chance.


90
0:10:0,51 --> 0:10:3,112
So what did Dad say?


91
0:10:3,112 --> 0:10:4,881
"You've reached Carl Buckner."


92
0:10:4,881 --> 0:10:8,84
Oh, "I'll be in the Ivory Coast
for the next 57 years."


93
0:10:8,84 --> 0:10:10,854
- Kabul this time.
- Whatever.


94
0:10:10,854 --> 0:10:15,91
Seriously, though, when you spoke to him,
what'd he say?


95
0:10:15,91 --> 0:10:21,197
- I didn't tell him.
- He doesn't know?


96
0:10:21,197 --> 0:10:24,434
You know what? If I was you,
I probably would've done the same thing.


97
0:10:24,434 --> 0:10:26,769
- Yeah?
- Once he finds out that his golden boy...


98
0:10:26,769 --> 0:10:31,241
...just got kicked out of Harvard, he'll dive
headfirst into an empty swimming pool.


99
0:10:31,241 --> 0:10:33,643
Gee, thanks.


100
0:10:33,643 --> 0:10:37,113
Oh, Steve's home.


101
0:10:37,113 --> 0:10:42,685
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.


102
0:10:42,685 --> 0:10:47,257
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Oh, honey, we have a guest.


103
0:10:47,257 --> 0:10:51,194
This is my kid brother, Matt.


104
0:10:51,194 --> 0:10:53,129
Hello, mate. How you doing?


105
0:10:53,129 --> 0:10:55,198
- It's good to finally meet you.
- And you.


106
0:10:55,198 --> 0:10:57,5
Finally made it
across the pond, then, did you?


107
0:10:57,5 --> 0:10:59,802
Yeah.


108
0:10:59,802 --> 0:11:3,373
Who's this? Who's this? Come on.


109
0:11:3,373 --> 0:11:6,709
I missed you. Come here.


110
0:11:6,709 --> 0:11:10,313
- Yeah.
- I missed you, my little lord Ben.


111
0:11:10,313 --> 0:11:12,482
- Honey, you want some tea?
- That'd be great.


112
0:11:12,482 --> 0:11:16,185
- Tea, huh?
- Get over it.


113
0:11:16,185 --> 0:11:18,688
- Good-looking little geezer, isn't he?
- He sure is.


114
0:11:18,688 --> 0:11:21,424
Listen, Matt, I'm really pleased
you're here, mate...


115
0:11:21,424 --> 0:11:23,927
...but I kind of
made some plans for tonight.


116
0:11:23,927 --> 0:11:27,63
I've got this romantic evening set up.
Got a babysitter booked...


117
0:11:27,63 --> 0:11:29,499
...and we got tickets to see Chicago.


118
0:11:29,499 --> 0:11:31,801
You wouldn't mind if we go, would you?


119
0:11:31,801 --> 0:11:37,373
Hold on, excuse me.


120
0:11:37,373 --> 0:11:39,943
What a surprise.


121
0:11:39,943 --> 0:11:46,749
- What you doing?
- Aye, aye. All right, bruv.


122
0:11:46,749 --> 0:11:49,552
Jesus, Shannon, you look rough.


123
0:11:49,552 --> 0:11:52,155
You're a funny guy, Pete.


124
0:11:52,155 --> 0:11:56,526
Matt, this is Pete, Steve's brother.
Pete, this is my brother, Matt.


125
0:11:56,526 --> 0:11:58,194
- Hey.
- Hi, son.


126
0:11:58,194 --> 0:12:0,597
Good to meet you.


127
0:12:0,597 --> 0:12:1,998
Hello, Ben.


128
0:12:1,998 --> 0:12:6,202
I'm West Ham till I die
I'm West Ham till I die


129
0:12:6,202 --> 0:12:9,372
I know I am
I'm sure I am


130
0:12:9,372 --> 0:12:14,711
- I'm taking him to bed. Hey.
- All right, babe.


131
0:12:14,711 --> 0:12:16,112
See you later, Ben.


132
0:12:16,112 --> 0:12:17,58
- Well done.
- What?


133
0:12:17,58 --> 0:12:20,883
- I thought you were going to the match.
- Well, technically, yes.


134
0:12:20,883 --> 0:12:24,787
But me and the boys got into a bit
of a drinking session last night.


135
0:12:24,787 --> 0:12:26,723
One thing's led to another--


136
0:12:26,723 --> 0:12:35,398
- Let me guess. You've lost your wallet.
- And me keys. There's a taxi outside.


137
0:12:35,398 --> 0:12:38,768
Top bloke, my brother.


138
0:12:38,768 --> 0:12:43,106
So...


139
0:12:43,106 --> 0:12:46,609
How are we, my colonial cousin?


140
0:12:46,609 --> 0:12:52,15
- Fine, thanks.
- "Fine, thanks."


141
0:12:52,15 --> 0:12:54,25
You couldn't make it 100, could you?


142
0:12:54,25 --> 0:12:57,353
- Yeah, how does "piss off" sound?
- Oh, fuck off, come on.


143
0:12:57,353 --> 0:13:0,957
Get some drinks in
Get some drinks in


144
0:13:0,957 --> 0:13:6,129
- Get--
- Shut up. Just shut up.


145
0:13:6,129 --> 0:13:9,65
I'll tell you what I'll do, all right?


146
0:13:9,65 --> 0:13:11,3
I'll give you...


147
0:13:11,3 --> 0:13:14,737
...a hundred...


148
0:13:14,737 --> 0:13:16,873
...if you take Matt to the match.


149
0:13:16,873 --> 0:13:20,543
Oh, fuck off, you're having a bubble.


150
0:13:20,543 --> 0:13:22,845
Bruv, you know I can't
take a Yank to football.


151
0:13:22,845 --> 0:13:32,422
Yeah, you can. And you're gonna be
on your best behavior, do you understand?


152
0:13:32,422 --> 0:13:36,59
- Go on.
- Well, come on, then.


153
0:13:36,59 --> 0:13:39,328
Cheers, Matt. We don't get
much time on our own.


154
0:13:39,328 --> 0:13:40,963
Right.


155
0:13:40,963 --> 0:13:45,668
Listen to me. You don't give him
the money. Okay? No way.


156
0:13:45,668 --> 0:13:47,57
- That's beer for the boys.
- All right.


157
0:13:47,57 --> 0:13:49,872
All right.


158
0:13:49,872 --> 0:13:52,608
Matt? Where are you going?


159
0:13:52,608 --> 0:13:55,678
I'm going to the soccer game with Pete.


160
0:13:55,678 --> 0:13:59,282
- But you just got here.
- I know, but I'll catch up with you later.


161
0:13:59,282 --> 0:14:1,35
- Yeah, have a good time.
- Hurry up.


162
0:14:1,35 --> 0:14:3,386
See you.


163
0:14:3,386 --> 0:14:6,956
I don't want him hanging out
with Pete and those thugs.


164
0:14:6,956 --> 0:14:10,393
It's all right. He's a big boy.
He can look after himself, can't he?


165
0:14:10,393 --> 0:14:16,332
Pick a hand. Come on.


166
0:14:16,332 --> 0:14:24,407
The right hand?
You've just won the star prize.


167
0:14:24,407 --> 0:14:27,71
Yeah?


168
0:14:27,71 --> 0:14:29,479
- How much do you love me?
- A lot.


169
0:14:29,479 --> 0:14:37,286
That's not enough.


170
0:14:37,286 --> 0:14:38,855
Look, mate...


171
0:14:38,855 --> 0:14:40,389
...I'm not being funny.


172
0:14:40,389 --> 0:14:43,493
But the last thing I wanna do
is take you to the match with me.


173
0:14:43,493 --> 0:14:45,695
So here's how it works.


174
0:14:45,695 --> 0:14:48,364
Give me half the money.
I'll go to football.


175
0:14:48,364 --> 0:14:51,1
You can have a wander round
where Churchill took a tom.


176
0:14:51,1 --> 0:14:53,97
Or whatever it is that you Yanks do
in jolly old.


177
0:14:53,97 --> 0:14:58,775
- A tom?
- A tom. A tom tit, a shit.


178
0:14:58,775 --> 0:15:2,712
It's rhyming slang.
Like "bees and honey" for money.


179
0:15:2,712 --> 0:15:6,749
All right, I can say to you,
give me the fucking bees.


180
0:15:6,749 --> 0:15:8,684
I made a promise to Steve.


181
0:15:8,684 --> 0:15:13,22
Well, Steve ain't here, is he, mate? I am.
And to be honest...


182
0:15:13,22 --> 0:15:15,892
...you're pissing in the wind
if you think I'm taking you.


183
0:15:15,892 --> 0:15:20,663
- I'm not giving you the money.
- You ain't really got a fucking choice, mate.


184
0:15:20,663 --> 0:15:26,936
And you're starting to get on my tits.
Give me half the money.


185
0:15:26,936 --> 0:15:30,94
Cops!


186
0:15:30,94 --> 0:15:33,643
Well, how fucking stupid
do you feel now?


187
0:15:33,643 --> 0:15:40,183
Come on then, dance for me, Yankee.


188
0:15:40,183 --> 0:15:43,319
Serves you right for fighting
like a bleeding tart.


189
0:15:43,319 --> 0:15:48,157
But try that again,
and I will kick the shit out of you.


190
0:15:48,157 --> 0:15:50,827
Yeah, the tom out of me, I get it.


191
0:15:50,827 --> 0:15:54,53
Get up, come on.


192
0:15:54,53 --> 0:15:57,266
So. I'm guessing you're not much
of a fighter.


193
0:15:57,266 --> 0:16:0,303
Fighter? That's probably
the first fight I ever had.


194
0:16:0,303 --> 0:16:4,841
You call that a fight?


195
0:16:4,841 --> 0:16:9,478
Fuck it. I will take you with me.
You might learn something.


196
0:16:9,478 --> 0:16:14,383
- About soccer?
- No, mate. Not about soccer.


197
0:16:14,383 --> 0:16:20,89
And for fuck's sake,
stop saying "soccer."


198
0:16:20,89 --> 0:16:25,161
Come on, hurry up.


199
0:16:25,161 --> 0:16:28,164
What are you talking about,
baseball is a girl's game?


200
0:16:28,164 --> 0:16:31,767
The Red Sox have a guy that pitches
a ball at over 90 miles an hour.


201
0:16:31,767 --> 0:16:35,938
Who cares? All that means is
he can have a wank faster than you.


202
0:16:35,938 --> 0:16:40,376
- Come on.
- Think about it.


203
0:16:40,376 --> 0:16:44,46
I just don't get it.
What is it with you Americans?


204
0:16:44,46 --> 0:16:46,749
You start a fucking war, bottle it...


205
0:16:46,749 --> 0:16:49,51
...then we have to come
save your ass again.


206
0:16:49,51 --> 0:16:50,453
Save our ass?


207
0:16:50,453 --> 0:16:55,424
Yes. And then, on top of that,
you kill half our soldiers in friendly fire.


208
0:16:55,424 --> 0:16:59,128
- That's called an accident.
- Yeah, accident, my ass.


209
0:16:59,128 --> 0:17:0,663
- All right.
- All right, Dunham.


210
0:17:0,663 --> 0:17:1,831
You all right, mate.


211
0:17:1,831 --> 0:17:4,734
Look...


212
0:17:4,734 --> 0:17:7,47
...we're sort of going into my place
of business, right?


213
0:17:7,47 --> 0:17:11,4
Shut up until you're spoken to
and you might have a better run of things.


214
0:17:11,4 --> 0:17:15,77
Only thing regarded worse than a Yank
around here are coppers and journalists.


215
0:17:15,77 --> 0:17:18,581
- What do you got against journalists?
- How long you got?


216
0:17:18,581 --> 0:17:22,818
They're lying fucking scum
who'll write anything just to fill papers.


217
0:17:22,818 --> 0:17:27,56
I mean, not your old man, of course.
He's the exception maybe.


218
0:17:27,56 --> 0:17:29,859
That's a point. These boys don't know
about your old man.


219
0:17:29,859 --> 0:17:33,195
And if I was you, I'd keep it that way.
Another thing.


220
0:17:33,195 --> 0:17:36,399
What you hear in here
stays in here, all right?


221
0:17:36,399 --> 0:17:40,69
No blabbing to brother Steve about
how your day was or who said what.


222
0:17:40,69 --> 0:17:43,5
What happens at football
stays at football, all right?


223
0:17:43,5 --> 0:17:45,107
Yeah, all right.


224
0:17:45,107 --> 0:17:51,814
Let's have some fun. It's football day.


225
0:17:51,814 --> 0:17:55,217
All right, Pete.


226
0:17:55,217 --> 0:17:57,42
Aye, aye!


227
0:17:57,42 --> 0:17:58,955
Welcome back.


228
0:17:58,955 --> 0:18:0,79
- We good?
- Yeah, good. yeah, good.


229
0:18:0,79 --> 0:18:1,991
How you doing, mate.


230
0:18:1,991 --> 0:18:4,894
All right, boys.
This is Matt, Shannon's brother.


231
0:18:4,894 --> 0:18:6,495
- You got Ned.
- Nice to meet you.


232
0:18:6,495 --> 0:18:8,597
- Dave.
- Nice to meet you.


233
0:18:8,597 --> 0:18:10,266
- Swill.
- Hello, mate.


234
0:18:10,266 --> 0:18:13,502
Ike, and the one with the dodgy
haircut's Keith.


235
0:18:13,502 --> 0:18:15,638
- Hey, Keith.
- I'll get the drinks in, then.


236
0:18:15,638 --> 0:18:17,239
Yeah, go on, get the drinks in.


237
0:18:17,239 --> 0:18:19,642
- Does that mean I'm getting them?
- Every fucking time.


238
0:18:19,642 --> 0:18:23,112
Every fucking time.
Every fucking time.


239
0:18:23,112 --> 0:18:25,381
- Fine.
- Where's Bovver?


240
0:18:25,381 --> 0:18:27,149
Been in the toilet for 15 minutes.


241
0:18:27,149 --> 0:18:30,152
Like dodgy Ruby or something,
down at Bengal last night.


242
0:18:30,152 --> 0:18:31,32
Look, he looks lost.


243
0:18:31,32 --> 0:18:34,256
No, "Ruby Murray" means curry.
We call it Cockney rhyming...


244
0:18:34,256 --> 0:18:36,959
- ...slang.
- Slang. Like "bees and honey" for money.


245
0:18:36,959 --> 0:18:39,595
- That's it, yeah.
- Like "struggle and grunt" for cunt.


246
0:18:39,595 --> 0:18:42,231
- Oh, you went dark. Why'd you go--?
- I'm not a cunt.


247
0:18:42,231 --> 0:18:44,867
Like "septic tank" for Yank.


248
0:18:44,867 --> 0:18:46,135
Hello.


249
0:18:46,135 --> 0:18:47,47
- All right, Bovver.
- Pete.


250
0:18:47,47 --> 0:18:49,338
- How you doing? All right?
- Sweet.


251
0:18:49,338 --> 0:18:51,14
This is Matt, Shannon's brother.


252
0:18:51,14 --> 0:18:54,477
Hey.


253
0:18:54,477 --> 0:18:57,98
That's the proper, right?
He don't give a fuck, does he?


254
0:18:57,98 --> 0:19:2,485
Mate, he's practically family.


255
0:19:2,485 --> 0:19:4,854
Mate, it's fucking painful.


256
0:19:4,854 --> 0:19:8,9
Bov's a miserable cunt,
but we love him dearly, don't we, boys?


257
0:19:8,9 --> 0:19:9,859
- Sometimes.
- Like a fucking brother.


258
0:19:9,859 --> 0:19:12,561
- Matt, grab these two pints for us, will you?
- Sure.


259
0:19:12,561 --> 0:19:15,97
- While you're there, get some peanuts.
- Sure.


260
0:19:15,97 --> 0:19:16,499
- Good boy.
- Bov, come on.


261
0:19:16,499 --> 0:19:17,666
He's all right, man.


262
0:19:17,666 --> 0:19:19,702
What's with all the fucking babysitting?


263
0:19:19,702 --> 0:19:21,637
You know we had a meet set up.


264
0:19:21,637 --> 0:19:23,939
It's all right, Bov.
He'll stay out of the way.


265
0:19:23,939 --> 0:19:27,176
- It's not like we didn't have it last night.
- What?


266
0:19:27,176 --> 0:19:28,744
That's not the bloody point.


267
0:19:28,744 --> 0:19:31,981
We look like mugs if we set
something up and our fearless leader...


268
0:19:31,981 --> 0:19:35,384
...don't show because he's playing
Pin the Tail on a Fucking Yank.


269
0:19:35,384 --> 0:19:38,421
No, he's right, man. He's got a point.


270
0:19:38,421 --> 0:19:41,223
You let me worry about that,
all right, boys?


271
0:19:41,223 --> 0:19:44,527
As for the Yank,
he's too modest to tell you...


272
0:19:44,527 --> 0:19:48,64
...but back in the States,
he's an internationally ranked...


273
0:19:48,64 --> 0:19:51,133
...double black belt in karate.


274
0:19:51,133 --> 0:19:53,969
- Is he fuck? Look at the size of him.
- No, no, no.


275
0:19:53,969 --> 0:19:56,972
Bloody Karate Kid film?
Based on his exploits.


276
0:19:56,972 --> 0:19:58,307
- Really?
- Yeah.


277
0:19:58,307 --> 0:19:59,909
- Really?
- Yeah, it's true.


278
0:19:59,909 --> 0:20:2,611
- Fucking straight.
- Bollocks. Bollocks.


279
0:20:2,611 --> 0:20:4,647
- Come on, why not?
- You're lying already.


280
0:20:4,647 --> 0:20:26,368
You've been here
fucking five minutes and you're lying.


281
0:20:26,368 --> 0:20:28,404
Hurry up, will you.


282
0:20:28,404 --> 0:20:45,521
Hurry up.


283
0:20:45,521 --> 0:20:54,763
He's now officially cockney, the boy is.


284
0:20:54,763 --> 0:20:57,133
- Oh, East London
- Is wonderful


285
0:20:57,133 --> 0:20:58,534
Is wonderful


286
0:20:58,534 --> 0:21:1,27
Oh, East London is wonderful


287
0:21:1,27 --> 0:21:4,34
It's full of tits, fanny and West Ham


288
0:21:4,34 --> 0:21:6,709
Oh, East London is wonderful


289
0:21:6,709 --> 0:21:9,445
- Oh, East London
- Oh, East London


290
0:21:9,445 --> 0:21:11,647
- Is wonderful
- Is wonderful


291
0:21:11,647 --> 0:21:15,351
Hey, Matt, that bollocks you was
talking about earlier about the Karate Kid.


292
0:21:15,351 --> 0:21:19,188
- I mean, that-- That's horse piss, right?
- Oh, no, no.


293
0:21:19,188 --> 0:21:22,458
- No, mate. Shit's Gospel of Paul.
- Really?


294
0:21:22,458 --> 0:21:24,994
What was your coach's name?


295
0:21:24,994 --> 0:21:27,96
Little chink geezer. What was his name?


296
0:21:27,96 --> 0:21:30,166
- In the first one?
- All fucking three of them, for fuck's sake.


297
0:21:30,166 --> 0:21:33,169
Why weren't you in the fourth one?
Why'd you let the side down?


298
0:21:33,169 --> 0:21:35,804
I remember thinking
why the fuck weren't you in there?


299
0:21:35,804 --> 0:21:37,673
The bird was in it.


300
0:21:37,673 --> 0:21:40,976
Stick your blue flag up your ass


301
0:21:40,976 --> 0:21:43,112
Up your ass
Up your ass


302
0:21:43,112 --> 0:21:45,915
What was his fucking name, you cunt?
Your mentor, man.


303
0:21:45,915 --> 0:21:48,117
- Yeah, his name.
- You owe it all to him.


304
0:21:48,117 --> 0:21:50,252
- I can't remember it.
- Wait, wait. Miyagi.


305
0:21:50,252 --> 0:21:52,755
- Miyagi. Fuck's sake.
- Miyagi.


306
0:21:52,755 --> 0:21:55,925
- Miyagi, Miyagi. Mr.-- Mr. Miyagi.
- Mr. Miyagi. He would have--


307
0:21:55,925 --> 0:21:58,561
He was based on a real person.
Based on a real person.


308
0:21:58,561 --> 0:22:2,164
They based him on a real person.
That's fucking out of order, if you ask me.


309
0:22:2,164 --> 0:22:3,332
Did they pay him?


310
0:22:3,332 --> 0:22:7,102
- Of course he got fucking paid.
- Imagine this. Just imagine this situation.


311
0:22:7,102 --> 0:22:8,604
He's getting all--


312
0:22:8,604 --> 0:22:11,674
No, listen, seriously,
imagine the situation.


313
0:22:11,674 --> 0:22:13,576
Someone used you in a fucking film...


314
0:22:13,576 --> 0:22:16,145
...and don't pay you--
Don't take the piss out of me.


315
0:22:16,145 --> 0:22:18,814
I'm talking--
This is real stuff that I'm talking about.


316
0:22:18,814 --> 0:22:23,385
The real Mr. Miyagi!


317
0:22:23,385 --> 0:22:25,888
Listen to this, this is our song.


318
0:22:25,888 --> 0:22:32,161
They reach the sky
And like my dreams they fade and die


319
0:22:32,161 --> 0:22:38,5
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere


320
0:22:38,5 --> 0:22:42,71
I'm forever blowing bubbles


321
0:22:42,71 --> 0:22:45,407
Pretty bubbles in the air


322
0:22:45,407 --> 0:22:49,745
United. United. United.


323
0:22:49,745 --> 0:22:56,352
Let's go fucking mental
Let's go fucking mental


324
0:22:56,352 --> 0:23:2,691
Let's go fucking mental
Let's go fucking mental


325
0:23:2,691 --> 0:23:11,367
Let's go fucking mental


326
0:23:11,367 --> 0:23:14,3
Friend of the family, eh?


327
0:23:14,3 --> 0:23:17,706
Pete might be showing you a bit
of courtesy, you being Shannon's brother.


328
0:23:17,706 --> 0:23:19,775
But get it straight.


329
0:23:19,775 --> 0:23:25,14
We don't like outsiders.


330
0:23:25,14 --> 0:23:43,332
All right?


331
0:23:43,332 --> 0:23:46,68
Cover your ass.


332
0:23:46,68 --> 0:23:49,638
Morning, mate.


333
0:23:49,638 --> 0:23:53,242
Hey, Pete, look, I'm gonna head home.
I'm not feeling so hot. Jet lag.


334
0:23:53,242 --> 0:23:55,544
Oh, fuck off. You're not missing the game.


335
0:23:55,544 --> 0:24:0,382
You're the one who wanted to learn
about "soccer."


336
0:24:0,382 --> 0:24:4,386
I'm forever blowing bubbles


337
0:24:4,386 --> 0:24:8,57
Pretty bubbles in the air


338
0:24:8,57 --> 0:24:12,795
They fly so high
They reach the sky


339
0:24:12,795 --> 0:24:16,598
And like my dreams they fade and die


340
0:24:16,598 --> 0:24:19,868
Fortune's always hiding


341
0:24:19,868 --> 0:24:22,838
I've looked everywhere


342
0:24:22,838 --> 0:24:28,544
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air


343
0:24:28,544 --> 0:24:49,998
United. United. United.


344
0:24:49,998 --> 0:24:53,35
Come on, United


345
0:24:53,35 --> 0:25:22,464
Come on, United


346
0:25:22,464 --> 0:25:28,36
Look out, mate. We're the most watched
country in the world.


347
0:25:28,36 --> 0:25:33,41
Keep your head down.


348
0:25:33,41 --> 0:25:38,18
Will the parents of a little John Deale
please contact the nearest steward.


349
0:25:38,18 --> 0:25:51,627
Our next three games are Fulham away,
Everton at home, Newcastle United away.


350
0:25:51,627 --> 0:26:10,546
Sweet, innit? Come on.


351
0:26:10,546 --> 0:26:17,119
Get the fuck out of here.


352
0:26:17,119 --> 0:26:30,499
Come on, United.


353
0:26:30,499 --> 0:26:44,613
- Go on, son, fucking have him.
- Forward, team.


354
0:26:44,613 --> 0:26:49,618
In the box, son.


355
0:26:49,618 --> 0:27:37,766
What the fuck?


356
0:27:37,766 --> 0:27:42,371
Come on.


357
0:27:42,371 --> 0:27:44,239
Dirty northern bastards.


358
0:27:44,239 --> 0:27:46,775
You fucking wanker.
You fucking--


359
0:27:46,775 --> 0:27:50,379
Come on, you fucking Zulu cunt.
Come on, I want you, you cunt.


360
0:27:50,379 --> 0:27:52,114
Come on, you fucking mug.


361
0:27:52,114 --> 0:27:54,583
I don't fucking believe it. He's over there.


362
0:27:54,583 --> 0:27:59,388
Look, it's fucking Bovver.
It's fucking Bovver. Look, he's over there.


363
0:27:59,388 --> 0:28:2,691
Go on, son.


364
0:28:2,691 --> 0:28:8,63
Yeah. Yes, fucking A.


365
0:28:8,63 --> 0:28:13,702
Fuck you.


366
0:28:13,702 --> 0:28:18,574
There he is. Oi, Bov.
Fucking quality, son. Fucking quality.


367
0:28:18,574 --> 0:28:21,643
- Stuff of legends.
- Well, you had your hands full, didn't you?


368
0:28:21,643 --> 0:28:23,745
Don't worry. It ain't over yet, boys.


369
0:28:23,745 --> 0:28:26,114
Word is these twats
are gonna have a pop.


370
0:28:26,114 --> 0:28:27,95
- What you heard?
- Oh, the usual.


371
0:28:27,95 --> 0:28:31,386
Fucking Zulus. There's like 50 or more
mobbing up the tube right now.


372
0:28:31,386 --> 0:28:33,221
It's gonna kick off near East Ham.


373
0:28:33,221 --> 0:28:36,91
- Time to go then, boys.
- What are we standing here for?


374
0:28:36,91 --> 0:28:37,859
All right, keep going...


375
0:28:37,859 --> 0:28:39,194
Let's get them.


376
0:28:39,194 --> 0:28:41,63
- I should head home.
- You know where you're going.


377
0:28:41,63 --> 0:28:43,231
- Back to Shan's.
- Bank Station?


378
0:28:43,231 --> 0:28:46,802
Yeah, but keep your head down.
Bloody Birmingham lot will be on the tube.


379
0:28:46,802 --> 0:28:48,403
That's all right, I'll manage.


380
0:28:48,403 --> 0:28:50,539
Fuck, wouldn't he be better in a crèche?


381
0:28:50,539 --> 0:28:53,675
Don't get on at East Ham.
If you see trouble, walk the other way.


382
0:28:53,675 --> 0:28:55,477
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry.


383
0:28:55,477 --> 0:29:14,896
Let's go, eh?


384
0:29:14,896 --> 0:29:26,742
Get him.


385
0:29:26,742 --> 0:29:29,911
- Look, I don't want any trouble.
- A fucking Yank.


386
0:29:29,911 --> 0:29:32,47
Why's a Yank running with the GSE?


387
0:29:32,47 --> 0:29:35,17
GSE? I don't know anything about the GSE.
I'm just a tourist.


388
0:29:35,17 --> 0:29:39,655
Oh, well, in that case, how's about we
leave you with a proper souvenir?


389
0:29:39,655 --> 0:29:41,323
Ever heard of a Chelsea grin?


390
0:29:41,323 --> 0:29:42,924
No, come on, please.


391
0:29:42,924 --> 0:29:50,332
Do you take American Express?


392
0:29:50,332 --> 0:29:53,35
I bet the Major gave out his shares
of Chelsea grins...


393
0:29:53,35 --> 0:29:56,538
...back in the good old days, eh?
Back when the GSE weren't so sloppy...


394
0:29:56,538 --> 0:29:58,807
...to leave one of their own behind.


395
0:29:58,807 --> 0:30:8,417
We don't leave our mates behind.


396
0:30:8,417 --> 0:30:11,119
Come on.


397
0:30:11,119 --> 0:30:12,521
You horrible bastard.


398
0:30:12,521 --> 0:30:15,791
- Look, he's getting away. Go. Come on.
- Don't lose sight of me.


399
0:30:15,791 --> 0:30:20,562
I'll get the van.


400
0:30:20,562 --> 0:30:21,963
Where the fuck's he gone?


401
0:30:21,963 --> 0:30:24,199
Two-foot small.
Where the fuck is he?


402
0:30:24,199 --> 0:30:26,334
I'm getting too old for this shit.


403
0:30:26,334 --> 0:30:35,911
Seriously, I could use a beer
and a lie-down.


404
0:30:35,911 --> 0:30:38,98
- Get it out of first.
- Can't get it out of your mom.


405
0:30:38,98 --> 0:30:40,916
This has to be financed though, right?


406
0:30:40,916 --> 0:30:42,651
Come on, lads, back to the Abbey.


407
0:30:42,651 --> 0:30:45,353
- Whose round is it?
- Whose fucking round do you think?


408
0:30:45,353 --> 0:30:48,59
- You're all supposed to be fucking--
- It's your round, then, Ned.


409
0:30:48,59 --> 0:30:51,193
- Oh, shut up, mate.
- It stinks.


410
0:30:51,193 --> 0:30:52,961
- Sit down.
- Who was that?


411
0:30:52,961 --> 0:30:55,53
- Fucking hell.
- Fuck off.


412
0:30:55,53 --> 0:30:57,299
Come on, boys.
This is fucking up.


413
0:30:57,299 --> 0:30:59,701
Let's sock the little cunt.


414
0:30:59,701 --> 0:31:2,804
Zulu! Zulu! Zulu!


415
0:31:2,804 --> 0:31:6,241
What the fuck is that?


416
0:31:6,241 --> 0:31:9,778
Well, come on, eh! What the fuck
you standing there for, you cunts?


417
0:31:9,778 --> 0:31:11,346
Fuck off, you cunts!


418
0:31:11,346 --> 0:31:14,983
What the fuck is that?


419
0:31:14,983 --> 0:31:17,185
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- What?


420
0:31:17,185 --> 0:31:18,92
- There's 20 guys.
- You don't run.


421
0:31:18,92 --> 0:31:22,9
Not when you're with us.
You stand your ground and fight.


422
0:31:22,9 --> 0:31:25,327
- Fight? I don't know how to fight.
- Just think of someone you hate.


423
0:31:25,327 --> 0:31:35,303
Come on, then.


424
0:31:35,303 --> 0:31:37,572
Get up-- Get up, you fucking twat!


425
0:31:37,572 --> 0:31:56,825
Come on!


426
0:31:56,825 --> 0:31:58,927
You fucking--


427
0:31:58,927 --> 0:32:10,5
Get off me.


428
0:32:10,5 --> 0:32:32,227
GSE! GSE!


429
0:32:32,227 --> 0:32:34,262
Come on! Come on!


430
0:32:34,262 --> 0:32:42,204
Come on!


431
0:32:42,204 --> 0:32:45,373
- Fuck, Pete.
- What do you make of that, then?


432
0:32:45,373 --> 0:32:48,31
What a fucking result, Bovver.


433
0:32:48,31 --> 0:32:51,546
You are a fucking maniac, Matt.
Look at me.


434
0:32:51,546 --> 0:32:53,48
Fair play, son.


435
0:32:53,48 --> 0:32:56,284
There's plenty would've bottled it and run.
You stood your ground.


436
0:32:56,284 --> 0:32:57,986
I'm proud of you. Good.


437
0:32:57,986 --> 0:32:59,421
- Who was he, then?
- Who?


438
0:32:59,421 --> 0:33:1,79
The geezer you was just fighting.


439
0:33:1,79 --> 0:33:3,992
Jeremy Van fucking Holden.


440
0:33:3,992 --> 0:33:8,83
You done yourself proud. Now we gotta stop
kissing each other's asses. Got to point out.


441
0:33:8,83 --> 0:33:10,665
- You see the first punch he threw.
- Yeah.


442
0:33:10,665 --> 0:33:13,201
- A little bit on the feminine side.
- A bit gay.


443
0:33:13,201 --> 0:33:16,838
Come on. That was my first hit. Come on.


444
0:33:16,838 --> 0:33:18,84
Come on, youse all wanna get pinched?


445
0:33:18,84 --> 0:33:39,527
His got it, let's push him out.


446
0:33:39,527 --> 0:33:41,329
Morning, sunshine.


447
0:33:41,329 --> 0:33:42,831
How do you feel?


448
0:33:42,831 --> 0:33:47,335
Oh, a little sore.


449
0:33:47,335 --> 0:33:51,473
English breakfast, double dose
of aspirin, you'll feel sweet as a nut, mate.


450
0:33:51,473 --> 0:33:52,641
Here.


451
0:33:52,641 --> 0:33:58,747
I gotta piss like a racehorse.


452
0:33:58,747 --> 0:34:1,683
Fucking journos. Look at this.


453
0:34:1,683 --> 0:34:4,653
West Ham wins 3-0,
in a blinding performance...


454
0:34:4,653 --> 0:34:8,59
...and our little scrap makes
the headline. Bloody muckrakers.


455
0:34:8,59 --> 0:34:11,59
So, what is this?


456
0:34:11,59 --> 0:34:13,361
Bollocks journo bullshit.


457
0:34:13,361 --> 0:34:17,899
- No, no, this, the GSE.
- Lower it, son.


458
0:34:17,899 --> 0:34:21,503
What are you guys, like an organized
political movement or something?


459
0:34:21,503 --> 0:34:24,239
No, mate. We're a firm.


460
0:34:24,239 --> 0:34:27,642
- You never heard of a firm in the States?
- No.


461
0:34:27,642 --> 0:34:33,682
All right. Every football team in Europe's
got a firm. Some have two.


462
0:34:33,682 --> 0:34:36,84
Christ. I forgot how clueless
you Yanks are.


463
0:34:36,84 --> 0:34:40,155
All you've seen of us is the stadium riots
on TV, innit? Come on.


464
0:34:40,155 --> 0:34:42,524
- Here you go love, two bacon sarnies.
- Thanks.


465
0:34:42,524 --> 0:34:45,293
See, West Ham football is mediocre.


466
0:34:45,293 --> 0:34:48,196
But our firm is top notch
and everyone knows it.


467
0:34:48,196 --> 0:34:51,533
The GSE. Green Street Elite.


468
0:34:51,533 --> 0:34:56,371
Arsenal: Great football,
shit firm, "The Gooners."


469
0:34:56,371 --> 0:35:0,442
Tottenham:
Shit football and a shit firm.


470
0:35:0,442 --> 0:35:1,91
"The Yids," they're called.


471
0:35:1,91 --> 0:35:5,38
I actually put their main lad through
a phone-box window the other day.


472
0:35:5,38 --> 0:35:8,216
- What about Millwall?
- Ah, Millwall.


473
0:35:8,216 --> 0:35:11,886
Where to even fucking
begin with Millwall.


474
0:35:11,886 --> 0:35:15,39
Millwall and West Ham firms hate
each other more than any other firms.


475
0:35:15,39 --> 0:35:17,459
Sort of like the Yankees
and the Red Sox.


476
0:35:17,459 --> 0:35:20,295
More like the Israelis
and the Palestinians.


477
0:35:20,295 --> 0:35:22,897
We haven't played Millwall in ten years.


478
0:35:22,897 --> 0:35:27,102
Their top boy's this geezer named
Tommy Hatcher. Horrible old cunt.


479
0:35:27,102 --> 0:35:30,572
Back in the Major's day,
Tommy's son was killed in a scrap.


480
0:35:30,572 --> 0:35:35,343
After that, he went completely mental.
Lost the plot.


481
0:35:35,343 --> 0:35:38,847
- Well, who's the Major?
- Ah, the Major.


482
0:35:38,847 --> 0:35:40,615
Quite a legend around here.


483
0:35:40,615 --> 0:35:43,918
He ran the GSE in the
early '90s, when I was coming up.


484
0:35:43,918 --> 0:35:46,21
Hardest bastard you ever saw.


485
0:35:46,21 --> 0:35:48,356
They say we kind of lost our way
when he left.


486
0:35:48,356 --> 0:35:54,29
But believe me, my boys are bringing
the old GSE reputation right back.


487
0:35:54,29 --> 0:35:57,132
So basically, firms are gangs.


488
0:35:57,132 --> 0:36:1,536
Kind of. But we're a far cry from all
that Bloods-and-Crips bullshit.


489
0:36:1,536 --> 0:36:5,173
I mean, shooting a machine gun out
of a moving car at an 8-year-old girl...


490
0:36:5,173 --> 0:36:7,509
...that's just cowardly.


491
0:36:7,509 --> 0:36:9,778
See, we might be into
fighting and all that...


492
0:36:9,778 --> 0:36:12,18
...but it's really about reputation.


493
0:36:12,18 --> 0:36:14,849
Humiliating another mob in a row...


494
0:36:14,849 --> 0:36:18,253
...or doing something that the other firms
get to hear or talk about.


495
0:36:18,253 --> 0:36:25,93
Like a Yank in his first fight,
battering one of Birmingham's main lads.


496
0:36:25,93 --> 0:36:27,228
- Here you are, love, sit down.
- Thank you.


497
0:36:27,228 --> 0:36:29,164
That's all right.


498
0:36:29,164 --> 0:36:32,667
Look, Pete, I don't know how to thank you
for what you did for me.


499
0:36:32,667 --> 0:36:36,271
Don't give it another thought.
Yesterday was a good result for us.


500
0:36:36,271 --> 0:36:39,974
We had a laugh, we had a few pints,
cheered on the mighty Hammers.


501
0:36:39,974 --> 0:36:43,678
We was completely outnumbered,
but we stuck by our mates...


502
0:36:43,678 --> 0:36:46,781
...and we stood our ground.
No matter what happened.


503
0:36:46,781 --> 0:37:0,161
That's what it's all about.


504
0:37:0,161 --> 0:37:4,199
- Look at the fucking state of him.
- Now, don't fucking start, all right?


505
0:37:4,199 --> 0:37:7,869
What did I say to you? I said to you
one simple thing: No trouble.


506
0:37:7,869 --> 0:37:9,404
It had nothing to do with me.


507
0:37:9,404 --> 0:37:13,74
He's walking home. He gets jumped.
Bruv, he's lucky we was there.


508
0:37:13,74 --> 0:37:15,243
Right. You're a real hero,
ain't you, mate?


509
0:37:15,243 --> 0:37:17,579
You saw the whole thing
from your sofa, did you?


510
0:37:17,579 --> 0:37:20,348
Tell you what, bruv.
You concentrate on your family...


511
0:37:20,348 --> 0:37:24,619
- ...and leave my business to me, all right?
- My family? What is it with you, eh?


512
0:37:24,619 --> 0:37:27,55
Do you want Mom to come
and visit you in the nick?


513
0:37:27,55 --> 0:37:29,691
Maybe you want the plot next to Dad.


514
0:37:29,691 --> 0:37:32,794
Oh, my God! Matt, what happened?


515
0:37:32,794 --> 0:37:34,129
Shannon, I'm fine.


516
0:37:34,129 --> 0:37:37,365
Pete, can't you see what you're doing
to this family?


517
0:37:37,365 --> 0:37:40,368
All I see is a scared old man.


518
0:37:40,368 --> 0:37:43,705
- Don't talk to me like--
- Get off him! You got the wrong idea.


519
0:37:43,705 --> 0:37:45,44
- Get your hands off me!
- Stop it!


520
0:37:45,44 --> 0:37:48,143
Steve! Leave it, leave it.


521
0:37:48,143 --> 0:37:51,79
Get the fuck out. Get out!


522
0:37:51,79 --> 0:37:56,217
Lying little shit.


523
0:37:56,217 --> 0:38:2,924
Babe, I'm so sorry.


524
0:38:2,924 --> 0:38:6,694
Well, that weren't the smartest
of moves, mate.


525
0:38:6,694 --> 0:38:11,499
But thanks, yeah.


526
0:38:11,499 --> 0:38:13,134
Fancy a pint?


527
0:38:13,134 --> 0:38:14,969
- No.
- Oh, come on.


528
0:38:14,969 --> 0:38:21,576
You're the one's that's
gotta buy the bleeding thing.


529
0:38:21,576 --> 0:38:23,912
Get your cash out,
the fat bird's about to sing.


530
0:38:23,912 --> 0:38:29,284
- So you still got your dough? You got it?
- Yeah.


531
0:38:29,284 --> 0:38:32,587
Jesus, you two joined
at the fucking hip, or what?


532
0:38:32,587 --> 0:38:34,722
Leave it out, Bov. It's getting old.


533
0:38:34,722 --> 0:38:37,158
No, I'm starting to wonder
about you two.


534
0:38:37,158 --> 0:38:44,98
I mean, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you was a couple of gay boys.


535
0:38:44,98 --> 0:38:46,668
Bov.


536
0:38:46,668 --> 0:38:49,137
We've known each other
a long time, yeah?


537
0:38:49,137 --> 0:38:52,64
I trust you more than
any other bloke I know.


538
0:38:52,64 --> 0:38:57,78
But you're getting dangerously close
to crossing the line with me.


539
0:38:57,78 --> 0:39:2,817
If you got a problem,
then it's your fucking problem. Not mine.


540
0:39:2,817 --> 0:39:6,554
But if you wanna discuss it further,
we can go outside.


541
0:39:6,554 --> 0:39:9,624
Beers, boys.


542
0:39:9,624 --> 0:39:11,96
- Hey, Bov, come on. It's your shot, mate.
- Pete.


543
0:39:11,96 --> 0:39:16,631
- Yeah, come on. Fuck all that.
- Go on with the game, mate.


544
0:39:16,631 --> 0:39:18,399
- Pete.
- Watch out.


545
0:39:18,399 --> 0:39:26,708
Everything all right, mate?


546
0:39:26,708 --> 0:39:30,912
I can't believe that you came all this way
and you didn't even stay the night.


547
0:39:30,912 --> 0:39:33,181
I don't want to mess
anything else up for you.


548
0:39:33,181 --> 0:39:35,16
Oh, you didn't mess anything up.


549
0:39:35,16 --> 0:39:39,554
- So you and Steve are okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.


550
0:39:39,554 --> 0:39:47,28
All right, well, I'll call you from Pete's.


551
0:39:47,28 --> 0:39:49,63
Matt.


552
0:39:49,63 --> 0:39:51,899
Please don't go.


553
0:39:51,899 --> 0:39:54,636
It's just Steve feels so horrible
about what happened...


554
0:39:54,636 --> 0:39:58,973
...and he really wants you
to stay with us, and so do I.


555
0:39:58,973 --> 0:40:4,679
- I don't want you to stay with Pete.
- Well, I wanna stay with Pete.


556
0:40:4,679 --> 0:40:8,816
You know Pete and his thug friends
aren't the answer.


557
0:40:8,816 --> 0:40:14,656
What are you talking about?
What answer?


558
0:40:14,656 --> 0:40:18,893
It's just, I've been begging you to come
and visit me for the last three years...


559
0:40:18,893 --> 0:40:21,963
...and you-- You didn't even come
to my wedding...


560
0:40:21,963 --> 0:40:25,333
...and you don't know my husband,
and you haven't held your nephew...


561
0:40:25,333 --> 0:40:28,236
...and you show up yesterday
and you're leaving already--


562
0:40:28,236 --> 0:40:41,316
Look who's talking. I mean, you ran
to another fucking country after Mom died.


563
0:40:41,316 --> 0:40:48,289
I'm sorry.


564
0:40:48,289 --> 0:40:59,801
- Will you come and visit me?
- Yeah, of course.


565
0:40:59,801 --> 0:41:3,838
Jeremy Van Holden?


566
0:41:3,838 --> 0:41:6,541
Sounds like a cunt.


567
0:41:6,541 --> 0:41:8,543
Mate, if he'd done that to me...


568
0:41:8,543 --> 0:41:13,848
...I'd smash seven shades
of shit out of him.


569
0:41:13,848 --> 0:41:18,119
Sounds like these Harvard boys
would slit your throat in your sleep.


570
0:41:18,119 --> 0:41:23,91
What was you studying?
Before this geezer stitched you up?


571
0:41:23,91 --> 0:41:25,893
- History.
- History?


572
0:41:25,893 --> 0:41:29,63
- I teach history.
- You teach?


573
0:41:29,63 --> 0:41:33,0
Yes. Cheeky slag.


574
0:41:33,0 --> 0:41:37,238
History and PE. What? Do you think
the GSE pay the bloody wage?


575
0:41:37,238 --> 0:41:40,108
Mate, I'm smart as fuck.


576
0:41:40,108 --> 0:41:46,114
Come on, it's brass monkeys out here.


577
0:41:46,114 --> 0:41:49,183
Class, today we have an
extraordinarily distinguished guest.


578
0:41:49,183 --> 0:41:51,85
Mr. Buckner is an American...


579
0:41:51,85 --> 0:41:55,823
...who went to the finest university
in the United States. Harvard.


580
0:41:55,823 --> 0:41:58,693
But despite his prestigious education...


581
0:41:58,693 --> 0:42:1,996
...Mr. Buckner still thinks...


582
0:42:1,996 --> 0:42:7,835
...that baseball is better than football.


583
0:42:7,835 --> 0:42:10,738
I know, boys. It's an utter sin.


584
0:42:10,738 --> 0:42:13,741
Now, it's our job to save
this heathen from his evil ways...


585
0:42:13,741 --> 0:42:17,78
...and teach him what really matters
in life. And that is?


586
0:42:17,78 --> 0:42:19,347
- Football!
- Exactly.


587
0:42:19,347 --> 0:42:24,385
We're gonna play five-a-side. Mr. Buckner
will be goalie for the away colors.


588
0:42:24,385 --> 0:42:34,829
Now, go easy on him, boys.
You know how these Americans bruise.


589
0:42:34,829 --> 0:42:36,297
So how do we keep this fair?


590
0:42:36,297 --> 0:42:38,466
I should let every other ball go through?


591
0:42:38,466 --> 0:42:41,903
I wouldn't worry about that, mate.


592
0:42:41,903 --> 0:42:54,282
All right. You ready?


593
0:42:54,282 --> 0:42:57,84
Go on, son.


594
0:42:57,84 --> 0:42:59,654
That's it, that's it.


595
0:42:59,654 --> 0:43:3,357
Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thing of beauty.


596
0:43:3,357 --> 0:43:8,229
Yes, yes.


597
0:43:8,229 --> 0:43:10,97
Go on, Duncan.


598
0:43:10,97 --> 0:43:15,36
Go on, son. Get out of it.
Take it all the way.


599
0:43:15,36 --> 0:43:28,616
Have it. Have it in, mate.


600
0:43:28,616 --> 0:43:44,532
All right, that's it.


601
0:43:44,532 --> 0:43:53,14
What was that?


602
0:43:53,14 --> 0:43:57,945
Beautiful. Oh, it's such a beauty.


603
0:43:57,945 --> 0:44:0,481
I love it.


604
0:44:0,481 --> 0:44:4,485
All right, kids.


605
0:44:4,485 --> 0:44:9,357
All right, let's go. Home team 10,
away team 3.


606
0:44:9,357 --> 0:44:12,927
Thanks to some pathetic goalkeeping
from the away keeper.


607
0:44:12,927 --> 0:44:18,165
All right, get yourselves changed,
boys, all right?


608
0:44:18,165 --> 0:44:22,169
- Now, that's what I call a real ass-whipping.
- Oh, you set me up.


609
0:44:22,169 --> 0:44:24,872
That was like the Junior Olympic
football team, right?


610
0:44:24,872 --> 0:44:27,408
No, mate, just regular English boys.


611
0:44:27,408 --> 0:44:30,378
We got history next.
Why don't you come say a few words...


612
0:44:30,378 --> 0:44:32,446
...about the American War
of Independence.


613
0:44:32,446 --> 0:44:35,182
They'd get a kick out of hearing it
from a colonial.


614
0:44:35,182 --> 0:44:38,519
Well, American history
isn't really my specialty.


615
0:44:38,519 --> 0:44:41,856
Mate, they're 10.
Teach them whatever you want.


616
0:44:41,856 --> 0:44:44,859
Well, I sort of have plans
with Shannon this afternoon. So...


617
0:44:44,859 --> 0:44:47,128
Fuck you, then.
We'll have a beer later, yeah?


618
0:44:47,128 --> 0:44:49,497
- Yeah, see you at the pub.
- All right, mate.


619
0:44:49,497 --> 0:44:52,233
Who are you! Who are you!


620
0:44:52,233 --> 0:44:54,735
These kids. He set me up, man.


621
0:44:54,735 --> 0:44:57,572
I'm in there thinking
this is some class of kids.


622
0:44:57,572 --> 0:45:1,375
Shut up.


623
0:45:1,375 --> 0:45:3,444
And they're coming in
fucking everywhere.


624
0:45:3,444 --> 0:45:6,881
Oh, come on.


625
0:45:6,881 --> 0:45:9,951
You say that?


626
0:45:9,951 --> 0:45:13,54
I saved more goals than you say.


627
0:45:13,54 --> 0:45:52,627
- No, no. No.
- No.


628
0:45:52,627 --> 0:45:54,929
- Jesus.
- Look at that fat cunt.


629
0:45:54,929 --> 0:45:57,565
You fucking little bastard.


630
0:45:57,565 --> 0:45:59,5
Go on, then. Get the fucking chips in.


631
0:45:59,5 --> 0:46:1,569
Well, I'll be fucked.


632
0:46:1,569 --> 0:46:5,339
If it ain't my old mate Bovver.


633
0:46:5,339 --> 0:46:7,708
How you doing, son? All right?


634
0:46:7,708 --> 0:46:10,478
I'll say one thing for you.
You got some fucking front...


635
0:46:10,478 --> 0:46:13,247
...showing your face
over this side of the water.


636
0:46:13,247 --> 0:46:17,985
There's plenty of people here love to kick
your fucking ass, given half the chance.


637
0:46:17,985 --> 0:46:19,887
There's four of them
stood over there.


638
0:46:19,887 --> 0:46:22,456
Fucking right, son.


639
0:46:22,456 --> 0:46:24,392
So tell me, what's this I'm hearing...


640
0:46:24,392 --> 0:46:31,198
...about your firm gone
all fucking international?


641
0:46:31,198 --> 0:46:37,304
Don't you even fucking think
about ignoring me, you little cunt.


642
0:46:37,304 --> 0:46:45,279
Now, I said, what's this bollocks I'm hearing
about you having a little Yank on the firm?


643
0:46:45,279 --> 0:46:48,683
It's only temporary.


644
0:46:48,683 --> 0:46:52,119
Temporary, eh?


645
0:46:52,119 --> 0:46:54,855
Do you think I might be able
to get a bit of quiet here?


646
0:46:54,855 --> 0:46:59,493
I'm trying to have
a fucking conversation.


647
0:46:59,493 --> 0:47:3,64
What's his problem?


648
0:47:3,64 --> 0:47:5,366
So look at you, little Bovver.


649
0:47:5,366 --> 0:47:7,568
All grown up now, look.


650
0:47:7,568 --> 0:47:9,403
Where's your other little girl...?


651
0:47:9,403 --> 0:47:11,839
- Petey.
- Petey.


652
0:47:11,839 --> 0:47:14,408
She at home, is she?
Trying to get her little toes...


653
0:47:14,408 --> 0:47:17,378
...into the Major's big fucking shoes?


654
0:47:17,378 --> 0:47:21,515
Yeah, I guess he was pretty small
back then, son.


655
0:47:21,515 --> 0:47:26,454
Back in your day.


656
0:47:26,454 --> 0:47:30,57
You always did have a bit
of bottle, you.


657
0:47:30,57 --> 0:47:35,529
So tell me, Bov.
You come over to Millwall.


658
0:47:35,529 --> 0:47:41,936
Did you come alone?


659
0:47:41,936 --> 0:47:46,73
Should I wind him up?
If I wind him up...


660
0:47:46,73 --> 0:47:51,612
Excuse me a minute, Bov.


661
0:47:51,612 --> 0:47:56,684
Hello? I'm Tommy. Tommy Hatcher.


662
0:47:56,684 --> 0:48:0,187
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh, you know?


663
0:48:0,187 --> 0:48:3,724
Well, now, you see, that's bad.
That's really, really bad.


664
0:48:3,724 --> 0:48:7,995
Because now you ain't got no excuse for
not keeping that shit cunt of yours quiet.


665
0:48:7,995 --> 0:48:10,998
Excuse me? George, you can't
let him talk to me like that.


666
0:48:10,998 --> 0:48:15,736
George, your bird hasn't stop fucking
rabbiting since I've walked in here.


667
0:48:15,736 --> 0:48:18,539
Now, can I recommend
that you shut her up...


668
0:48:18,539 --> 0:48:22,743
...so I can continue my conversation
with our guest there, Bovver...


669
0:48:22,743 --> 0:48:24,912
...of the once-proud GSE firm?


670
0:48:24,912 --> 0:48:27,114
You can't tell me-- My God!


671
0:48:27,114 --> 0:48:30,518
You see what she's doing?
Does she ever fucking stop?


672
0:48:30,518 --> 0:48:32,52
Ever, fucking, ever?


673
0:48:32,52 --> 0:48:35,623
- That's enough!
- That's enough?


674
0:48:35,623 --> 0:48:38,259
I'll tell you when it's enough,
son, all right?


675
0:48:38,259 --> 0:48:39,827
Look at her. Tommy.


676
0:48:39,827 --> 0:48:42,93
The Paki's called the old bill, mate.
Come on, we best fuck off.


677
0:48:42,93 --> 0:48:48,202
Tommy, we best fuck off sharpish, mate.


678
0:48:48,202 --> 0:48:50,504
I'll see you again.


679
0:48:50,504 --> 0:49:24,505
Soon, Bov.


680
0:49:24,505 --> 0:49:27,174
I don't reckon I'll be back
till tomorrow night.


681
0:49:27,174 --> 0:49:29,844
Be gentle with her, and remember...


682
0:49:29,844 --> 0:49:37,151
- ...left side.
- Left side. Right.


683
0:49:37,151 --> 0:49:41,655
- You seem nervous.
- Nervous? Fuck off.


684
0:49:41,655 --> 0:49:43,591
What's on your mind, then?


685
0:49:43,591 --> 0:49:47,161
Just two little words keep
every Hammer in England up all night.


686
0:49:47,161 --> 0:49:48,796
United. Away.


687
0:49:48,796 --> 0:49:50,331
- Oi, oi.
- All right, boys.


688
0:49:50,331 --> 0:49:52,766
Aye, aye.


689
0:49:52,766 --> 0:49:55,669
- All right, mate. You all right?
- Yeah, all right, big man.


690
0:49:55,669 --> 0:49:57,104
- How's it going?
- Good.


691
0:49:57,104 --> 0:50:0,908
Hello, Matt.


692
0:50:0,908 --> 0:50:3,344
- Where's Bovver?
- Fuck knows.


693
0:50:3,344 --> 0:50:6,48
He's been a pain in the ass all week.
Must have PMS.


694
0:50:6,48 --> 0:50:10,985
Pre-match stress. Guy's being a right cunt
at the minute, isn't he?


695
0:50:10,985 --> 0:50:17,258
- Come on, Pete, the train's in five minutes.
- Yeah, hang on.


696
0:50:17,258 --> 0:50:21,362
His fucking phone is off. I can't believe
he's gonna pull a runner for United away.


697
0:50:21,362 --> 0:50:26,433
They're gonna be gunning for you too. After
the job you pulled on their top boy last year.


698
0:50:26,433 --> 0:50:29,103
What happened last year?


699
0:50:29,103 --> 0:50:32,74
- I may have gone a bit over the top.
- Yeah, just a bit?


700
0:50:32,74 --> 0:50:36,43
- Where's Dave? You heard from him?
- Have you?


701
0:50:36,43 --> 0:50:40,514
Oh, everything's just falling
right into place, innit?


702
0:50:40,514 --> 0:50:42,583
I'll go.


703
0:50:42,583 --> 0:50:44,385
- No, mate.
- What?


704
0:50:44,385 --> 0:50:47,187
I'll go. You can't just go up there
with Ike and Swill.


705
0:50:47,187 --> 0:50:50,291
No offense, mate, but we can't take
passengers on this trip.


706
0:50:50,291 --> 0:50:52,326
Go on, piss off. Give you a bell later.


707
0:50:52,326 --> 0:50:55,95
So how many Reds do you reckon
we're gonna tear up today?


708
0:50:55,95 --> 0:50:57,531
Fuck knows. Enough.


709
0:50:57,531 --> 0:51:2,803
- Catch it.
- How's that?


710
0:51:2,803 --> 0:51:8,742
The 2:55 train to Manchester Express
will be approaching...


711
0:51:8,742 --> 0:51:11,946
- All right, lads. Bovver.
- Sweet, mate.


712
0:51:11,946 --> 0:51:14,415
I thought we agreed to meet
in the car park.


713
0:51:14,415 --> 0:51:16,442
Decided to wait here.


714
0:51:16,442 --> 0:51:19,278
Look, Bov, you wanna play the wanker,
that's fine with me.


715
0:51:19,278 --> 0:51:23,349
But leave it out till we got today
out of the way, all right?


716
0:51:23,349 --> 0:51:25,818
You all right, mate?
Keith. Come on, boys.


717
0:51:25,818 --> 0:51:33,826
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Let's have it.


718
0:51:33,826 --> 0:51:35,861
No, I'm not lending you
any more money.


719
0:51:35,861 --> 0:51:39,231
- I don't owe you any money.
- For fuck's sake, come on, play the game.


720
0:51:39,231 --> 0:51:47,139
- You never paid me for the last time.
- You taking the piss or what?


721
0:51:47,139 --> 0:51:48,674
What are you doing here, Matt?


722
0:51:48,674 --> 0:51:52,278
- I thought it was just the three of you.
- Oh, isn't that sweet?


723
0:51:52,278 --> 0:51:55,548
This what--?
This your proper planning, eh?


724
0:51:55,548 --> 0:51:58,851
I ain't going in with that fucking mug.


725
0:51:58,851 --> 0:52:0,553
- Sit down, mate.
- Come on, mate.


726
0:52:0,553 --> 0:52:2,888
Hello, mate.


727
0:52:2,888 --> 0:52:8,36
- Who's calling what?
- I ain't got any money.


728
0:52:8,36 --> 0:52:15,534
- He's here now...
- Fucking hell.


729
0:52:15,534 --> 0:52:17,57
No, I don't. Think of any footballer.


730
0:52:17,57 --> 0:52:20,406
- Think of any other fucking footballer.
- Robbie Fowler.


731
0:52:20,406 --> 0:52:22,541
- He's not, not really.
- He looks like...


732
0:52:22,541 --> 0:52:23,709
Dave, where are you?


733
0:52:23,709 --> 0:52:25,478
- Sorry I missed you.
- Plane late?


734
0:52:25,478 --> 0:52:26,946
The flight was an hour late.


735
0:52:26,946 --> 0:52:28,314
- Fly faster.
- I'm here.


736
0:52:28,314 --> 0:52:29,849
What, Manchester?


737
0:52:29,849 --> 0:52:31,55
Yeah. But...


738
0:52:31,55 --> 0:52:35,87
There's like 40 of them waiting here,
all getting very fucking excited.


739
0:52:35,87 --> 0:52:38,624
- So have a listen.
- United! United!


740
0:52:38,624 --> 0:52:43,229
Oi, Bov.


741
0:52:43,229 --> 0:52:45,664
- Fuck.
- Do you hear that?


742
0:52:45,664 --> 0:52:48,434
- Yeah, mate.
- They're waiting here for you.


743
0:52:48,434 --> 0:52:51,3
Don't roll into Manchester.
Do you hear me?


744
0:52:51,3 --> 0:52:54,673
- All right, nice one.
- All right, laters.


745
0:52:54,673 --> 0:52:57,71
We are fucked.


746
0:52:57,71 --> 0:53:0,579
- What's happening?
- They're waiting for us at the station.


747
0:53:0,579 --> 0:53:2,381
What, they know we're on here?


748
0:53:2,381 --> 0:53:4,416
Yeah, must have had
a scout watching us.


749
0:53:4,416 --> 0:53:7,186
- How many?
- Forty, 50.


750
0:53:7,186 --> 0:53:10,489
- Can't we get off at the next station?
- This is the express train.


751
0:53:10,489 --> 0:53:18,497
- Don't stop till Manchester.
- Is that right, bruv?


752
0:53:18,497 --> 0:53:22,701
Come on. Come on, boys. If we don't
show up now, they'll claim a result.


753
0:53:22,701 --> 0:53:26,405
- Fuck that. We got to get to that station.
- Are you insane? We just got away.


754
0:53:26,405 --> 0:53:28,607
Shut the fuck up.
You shouldn't even be here.


755
0:53:28,607 --> 0:53:31,477
This is what it's all about.
It's what we fucking live for.


756
0:53:31,477 --> 0:53:33,612
- Fuck him.
- All right, here's the plan.


757
0:53:33,612 --> 0:53:37,383
Ike, call Dave, tell him what's happening.
It's about 12 miles to Manchester.


758
0:53:37,383 --> 0:53:41,854
We need a couple of cabs immediately.


759
0:53:41,854 --> 0:53:49,962
Fuck! Where's all the fucking cabs?


760
0:53:49,962 --> 0:53:53,32
Pete, I got an idea.


761
0:53:53,32 --> 0:53:55,167
- I told you to shut up.
- Fuck you, Bovver.


762
0:53:55,167 --> 0:53:57,69
- You what?
- Cut it--


763
0:53:57,69 --> 0:54:0,105
Fucking cut it out! What is it?


764
0:54:0,105 --> 0:54:2,908
Who the fuck are Man United?


765
0:54:2,908 --> 0:54:5,644
Who the fuck are Man United?


766
0:54:5,644 --> 0:54:10,249
MP, this is MM5 in the vicinity
of the last report, responding.


767
0:54:10,249 --> 0:54:14,587
Where the fuck are these cunts? That train
should have been here 10 minutes ago.


768
0:54:14,587 --> 0:54:18,157
They'll be here soon enough.
There's no way off that train. Stay sharp.


769
0:54:18,157 --> 0:54:21,527
And remember, Nigel gets that
Dunham cunt all to himself.


770
0:54:21,527 --> 0:54:28,567
- That's right.
- Nice one.


771
0:54:28,567 --> 0:54:32,271
- What the fuck do you want?
- Sorry, we're with Paramount Pictures...


772
0:54:32,271 --> 0:54:35,14
...shooting the Hugh Grant film.
We gotta get this through.


773
0:54:35,14 --> 0:54:37,743
Hugh Grant film?
Any decent women in it?


774
0:54:37,743 --> 0:54:41,547
- Cameron Diaz, I think.
- I hope so. She's fit as fuck.


775
0:54:41,547 --> 0:54:48,821
- All right, lads, let this come through.
- Thanks.


776
0:54:48,821 --> 0:54:51,223
Give me 30 seconds,
then I get the fuck out.


777
0:54:51,223 --> 0:54:55,895
Where's your famous, Where's your famous?
Where's your famous GSE?


778
0:54:55,895 --> 0:56:4,263
Where's your famous GSE?


779
0:56:4,263 --> 0:56:8,167
There's your famous,
There's your famous GSE


780
0:56:8,167 --> 0:56:22,314
There's your famous GSE


781
0:56:22,314 --> 0:56:25,117
We could have died that day
in Manchester.


782
0:56:25,117 --> 0:56:27,853
Everybody knew it. But we didn't.


783
0:56:27,853 --> 0:56:30,589
Ike said later that the story
traveled across England...


784
0:56:30,589 --> 0:56:36,128
...faster than the death of Lady Di.
The GSE were finally back.


785
0:56:36,128 --> 0:56:39,131
Suddenly I was part of the firm
with the best rep in London.


786
0:56:39,131 --> 0:56:41,633
- The old guard.
- The old guard.


787
0:56:41,633 --> 0:56:43,569
People around town had heard of me.


788
0:56:43,569 --> 0:56:47,573
They would hear my accent
and say, "So you're the Yank."


789
0:56:47,573 --> 0:56:53,45
Till I die


790
0:56:53,45 --> 0:56:56,982
United! United!


791
0:56:56,982 --> 0:56:58,584
You know the best part?


792
0:56:58,584 --> 0:57:1,253
It isn't knowing that your friends
have your back.


793
0:57:1,253 --> 0:57:13,832
It's knowing that you
have your friend's back.


794
0:57:13,832 --> 0:57:15,234
They're on me.


795
0:57:15,234 --> 0:57:17,77
I'd never lived closer to danger.


796
0:57:17,77 --> 0:57:20,39
But I'd never felt safer.


797
0:57:20,39 --> 0:57:22,174
I'd never felt more confident...


798
0:57:22,174 --> 0:57:26,45
...and people could spot it
from a mile away.


799
0:57:26,45 --> 0:57:29,848
And as for this, the violence...


800
0:57:29,848 --> 0:57:35,22
...I gotta be honest. It grew on me.


801
0:57:35,22 --> 0:57:39,825
Once you've taken a few punches
and realize you're not made of glass...


802
0:57:39,825 --> 0:57:54,306
...you don't feel alive unless you're
pushing yourself as far as you can go.


803
0:57:54,306 --> 0:58:0,879
So, what couldn't you tell me--?


804
0:58:0,879 --> 0:58:4,95
I had to find out from your sister
that you're expelled?


805
0:58:4,95 --> 0:58:8,53
- Why didn't you call me?
- I did. Your machine answered.


806
0:58:8,53 --> 0:58:10,222
You could have left a message.


807
0:58:10,222 --> 0:58:14,326
Well, I'm tired of having
a relationship with your voice mail.


808
0:58:14,326 --> 0:58:16,562
You know what? I don't need this.


809
0:58:16,562 --> 0:58:19,565
Hey, Matt. Matt, come--


810
0:58:19,565 --> 0:58:22,868
Hey, come on. Shannon says
you were set up. Is that true?


811
0:58:22,868 --> 0:58:24,903
- Yes.
- Well, then why didn't you find me?


812
0:58:24,903 --> 0:58:27,94
Why didn't I find you?
What's your fucking point?


813
0:58:27,94 --> 0:58:30,75
My point is, this doesn't look good, Matt.


814
0:58:30,75 --> 0:58:33,178
You say that you're set up.
You don't even contact your father?


815
0:58:33,178 --> 0:58:35,948
We could have fought this together
if you were innocent.


816
0:58:35,948 --> 0:58:38,83
- If I were innocent?
- If you're innocent...


817
0:58:38,83 --> 0:58:40,953
- ...why didn't you ask for help?
- You think I'm a dealer?


818
0:58:40,953 --> 0:58:43,388
- Obviously, I don't know.
- But what do you think?


819
0:58:43,388 --> 0:58:46,959
- I don't know.
- Well, that's why I didn't find you.


820
0:58:46,959 --> 0:58:54,266
Of course you don't know what to think.
You don't really know anything about me.


821
0:58:54,266 --> 0:58:57,536
So you-- You came to England?


822
0:58:57,536 --> 0:59:0,806
- Yeah.
- Okay, what now, Matt? What's the plan?


823
0:59:0,806 --> 0:59:3,609
- What do you really want?
- Come on, it's just a question.


824
0:59:3,609 --> 0:59:7,746
Listen, Carl. Do you really expect
me to unburden myself to you?


825
0:59:7,746 --> 0:59:16,688
You just show up and decide
you're the dad again?


826
0:59:16,688 --> 0:59:20,559
Look, I-- I have to go to
the London Times.


827
0:59:20,559 --> 0:59:24,62
- You're unbelievable. You know that?
- Just someone I'd like you to meet.


828
0:59:24,62 --> 0:59:28,267
I'm not 5 years old anymore. It takes
a little bit more to manipulate me.


829
0:59:28,267 --> 0:59:30,836
Just an old friend from
my Tribune days. I thought--


830
0:59:30,836 --> 0:59:34,273
You thought all it takes is a handshake
from the editor of the Times...


831
0:59:34,273 --> 0:59:42,214
...and I'll have my old life back?


832
0:59:42,214 --> 0:59:53,759
It's just a free lunch.


833
0:59:53,759 --> 0:59:57,829
Welcome to the quarterfinal draw
for the Football Association Cup.


834
0:59:57,829 --> 1:0:2,167
The oldest and most prestigious
tournament in world club football.


835
1:0:2,167 --> 1:0:6,71
Fortunately, today, we have with us the
West Ham legend, Mr. Frank McAvennie...


836
1:0:6,71 --> 1:0:9,441
...and chairman for our sponsors,
Mr. Phil Peters.


837
1:0:9,441 --> 1:0:15,247
As usual, the home team
will be drawn first. Frank?


838
1:0:15,247 --> 1:0:18,5
- Number two.
- Number two.


839
1:0:18,5 --> 1:0:22,87
- Cardiff City will play...
- Number three.


840
1:0:22,87 --> 1:0:26,291
- Number three, Liverpool.
- Yes.


841
1:0:26,291 --> 1:0:28,594
Number seven.


842
1:0:28,594 --> 1:0:32,764
- Number seven, Sunderland, will play...
- Number six.


843
1:0:32,764 --> 1:0:36,935
Number six, Newcastle United.
Bit of a northeast derby.


844
1:0:36,935 --> 1:0:42,541
- Number eight.
- Number eight, West Ham United...


845
1:0:42,541 --> 1:0:45,1
...will play...


846
1:0:45,1 --> 1:0:48,547
- ...number five, Millwall.
- Fucking yes!


847
1:0:48,547 --> 1:0:50,382
Yes!


848
1:0:50,382 --> 1:0:55,287
- Yes!
- Come on, you Lions!


849
1:0:55,287 --> 1:0:59,191
Fucking nice.


850
1:0:59,191 --> 1:1:1,994
Bov, mate, we got them, mate.


851
1:1:1,994 --> 1:1:7,65
Oi, bruv, this is gonna go off.


852
1:1:7,65 --> 1:1:9,668
You're not gonna believe
who I've seen walk into the Times.


853
1:1:9,668 --> 1:1:11,47
What? Who?


854
1:1:11,47 --> 1:1:15,14
Our little Yank mate.


855
1:1:15,14 --> 1:1:16,808
I fucking knew it.


856
1:1:16,808 --> 1:1:19,978
I knew there was something
dodgy about that little cunt.


857
1:1:19,978 --> 1:1:22,8
Yeah, mate, he's sly.


858
1:1:22,8 --> 1:1:24,583
Here, I'll tell you what.
Pick me up after work.


859
1:1:24,583 --> 1:1:26,952
All right. I'll see you
after work. Sweet.


860
1:1:26,952 --> 1:1:29,354
You know your sister's
worried sick about you.


861
1:1:29,354 --> 1:1:32,124
She says you're running around
with some kind of gang.


862
1:1:32,124 --> 1:1:36,194
It's not a gang, Dad.
They're my friends.


863
1:1:36,194 --> 1:1:38,23
Well, are you at least writing about it?


864
1:1:38,23 --> 1:1:41,33
Am I writing about it? No.


865
1:1:41,33 --> 1:1:45,437
Hey, Matt, listen.
I want you to come home with me.


866
1:1:45,437 --> 1:1:47,105
- What?
- No, look...


867
1:1:47,105 --> 1:1:50,242
...you may not trust me as your father,
but as a journalist...


868
1:1:50,242 --> 1:1:52,744
...I'm telling you your reputation
is all you have.


869
1:1:52,744 --> 1:1:57,382
You've gotta get back to Harvard.
You gotta clear your name.


870
1:1:57,382 --> 1:1:59,451
We can-- We can fight it together.


871
1:1:59,451 --> 1:2:1,753
Oh, forget it, Dad.


872
1:2:1,753 --> 1:2:4,122
I'm not going home.


873
1:2:4,122 --> 1:2:8,16
Jesus.


874
1:2:8,16 --> 1:2:10,529
Look...


875
1:2:10,529 --> 1:2:12,798
...if it makes you feel better...


876
1:2:12,798 --> 1:2:15,4
...I am keeping a journal.


877
1:2:15,4 --> 1:2:18,637
It's one thing you taught me
I held onto.


878
1:2:18,637 --> 1:2:20,439
I knew that.


879
1:2:20,439 --> 1:2:26,645
I was just making sure.


880
1:2:26,645 --> 1:2:28,213
Hey, Steve.


881
1:2:28,213 --> 1:2:31,55
- How you doing? Good to see you.
- Good to see you.


882
1:2:31,55 --> 1:2:32,951
- Matt.
- Hey.


883
1:2:32,951 --> 1:2:35,42
I'm gonna get changed.
What time's your flight?


884
1:2:35,42 --> 1:2:39,491
You take your time. My cab will be here
in about half an hour. So...


885
1:2:39,491 --> 1:2:42,994
I have to say farewell
to my grandson anyway.


886
1:2:42,994 --> 1:2:47,632
I gotta take off, Dad.


887
1:2:47,632 --> 1:2:50,769
Okay, Matt.


888
1:2:50,769 --> 1:2:58,543
Look, I know things have not been...


889
1:2:58,543 --> 1:3:7,552
Great to see you.


890
1:3:7,552 --> 1:3:10,255
- How you doing?
- Good.


891
1:3:10,255 --> 1:3:13,24
So you'll be celebrating the draw
with the lads, then?


892
1:3:13,24 --> 1:3:14,86
The draw. Wait, who did we get?


893
1:3:14,86 --> 1:3:18,196
- You mean you don't know?
- No.


894
1:3:18,196 --> 1:3:22,367
- Oh, come on, Steve. Who?
- Millwall.


895
1:3:22,367 --> 1:3:29,174
At home.


896
1:3:29,174 --> 1:3:32,31
Hello. Hello.


897
1:3:32,31 --> 1:3:38,65
Don't we want to play?


898
1:3:38,65 --> 1:3:40,786
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey.


899
1:3:40,786 --> 1:3:44,189
You okay?


900
1:3:44,189 --> 1:3:47,793
Yeah, I was just watching my dad
playing with Ben.


901
1:3:47,793 --> 1:3:52,197
He's already a better grandfather
than he ever was a dad.


902
1:3:52,197 --> 1:3:55,3
You know, he seems
like a decent bloke now...


903
1:3:55,3 --> 1:4:2,641
...for a bloody journo.


904
1:4:2,641 --> 1:4:6,111
So he was an asshole
when you were growing up.


905
1:4:6,111 --> 1:4:9,448
I guess that's why neither of you
joined the old man's racket.


906
1:4:9,448 --> 1:4:11,82
What do you mean?


907
1:4:11,82 --> 1:4:14,586
You know, following in his footsteps.


908
1:4:14,586 --> 1:4:16,621
What are you talking about? Matt did.


909
1:4:16,621 --> 1:4:20,525
- What do you mean?
- Matt was always a little more fascinated...


910
1:4:20,525 --> 1:4:25,33
...with our absentee father than I was.


911
1:4:25,33 --> 1:4:28,667
Shannon, what do you mean, "Matt did"?


912
1:4:28,667 --> 1:4:33,4
That's what Matt studied at Harvard.
He was a journalism major.


913
1:4:33,4 --> 1:4:37,609
I just really hope that he gets back to it.


914
1:4:37,609 --> 1:4:49,955
You know, once he gets
your brother out of his system.


915
1:4:49,955 --> 1:4:53,725
So he's a Yank and an undercover journo.


916
1:4:53,725 --> 1:5:8,54
Looks like we'll have to give
the boy two funerals.


917
1:5:8,54 --> 1:5:10,709
We hate Millwall
We hate Millwall


918
1:5:10,709 --> 1:5:12,577
We hate Millwall
We hate Millwall


919
1:5:12,577 --> 1:5:15,647
We are the Millwall haters
We hate Millwall


920
1:5:15,647 --> 1:5:17,916
We hate Millwall
We hate Millwall


921
1:5:17,916 --> 1:5:19,618
Steve, what are you doing here?


922
1:5:19,618 --> 1:5:21,62
I want a word with you outside.


923
1:5:21,62 --> 1:5:25,56
- What happened? Is Shannon okay?
- Yeah, Shannon's fine.


924
1:5:25,56 --> 1:5:27,792
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Steve Dunham just walked in.


925
1:5:27,792 --> 1:5:30,195
Why didn't you tell me
you're doing journalism?


926
1:5:30,195 --> 1:5:32,464
I'm not. I quit.
What difference does it make?


927
1:5:32,464 --> 1:5:35,967
Well, listen, mate, to some people, yeah,
it makes a huge difference.


928
1:5:35,967 --> 1:5:39,7
Well, what would you know about that?


929
1:5:39,7 --> 1:5:40,972
Listen to me. I like you...


930
1:5:40,972 --> 1:5:43,408
...but you have no idea
what you're getting into.


931
1:5:43,408 --> 1:5:46,912
Now, I've got to tell my brother
that his new best mate is a journalist.


932
1:5:46,912 --> 1:5:50,615
So me and you are going outside now.


933
1:5:50,615 --> 1:5:53,652
A toast.


934
1:5:53,652 --> 1:5:56,288
Stevie Dunham...


935
1:5:56,288 --> 1:6:1,726
...back in the Abbey after
all these years.


936
1:6:1,726 --> 1:6:3,528
Welcome home, Major.


937
1:6:3,528 --> 1:6:5,964
- The Major.
- The Major.


938
1:6:5,964 --> 1:6:10,168
Major, Major, Major


939
1:6:10,168 --> 1:6:12,938
GSE, GSE, GSE


940
1:6:12,938 --> 1:6:22,838
GSE, GSE, GSE


941
1:6:22,838 --> 1:6:31,847
All right, hang on.


942
1:6:31,847 --> 1:6:34,383
All right, boys.
What are you lot doing here?


943
1:6:34,383 --> 1:6:35,851
- The Yank here?
- No.


944
1:6:35,851 --> 1:6:40,122
- He's a fucking undercover journo.
- What?


945
1:6:40,122 --> 1:6:41,857
No, bollocks.


946
1:6:41,857 --> 1:6:46,162
Straight, mate. I see him down the Times
with all the other journalists, shaking hands.


947
1:6:46,162 --> 1:6:49,465
- I mean, proper pally. What's all that about?
- Think about it.


948
1:6:49,465 --> 1:6:52,868
Drops in out of nowhere.
Never been in a scrap in his life.


949
1:6:52,868 --> 1:6:56,872
Snugs in nice and tight
with a top boy of the firm.


950
1:6:56,872 --> 1:7:1,21
For fuck's sake, Pete,
what else was he doing at the Times?


951
1:7:1,21 --> 1:7:3,245
No, that means fuck all.


952
1:7:3,245 --> 1:7:5,715
Could've been any one of 100 reasons
he was there.


953
1:7:5,715 --> 1:7:9,285
Yeah, well, this time I'd like to make sure
of that myself.


954
1:7:9,285 --> 1:7:10,786
You sure of this, Bov?


955
1:7:10,786 --> 1:7:14,924
Because if you're coming in here like this,
you fucking well better be.


956
1:7:14,924 --> 1:7:27,303
Yeah, watch your back, son.


957
1:7:27,303 --> 1:7:29,138
What, this his, is it?


958
1:7:29,138 --> 1:7:31,64
- Yeah.
- Yeah?


959
1:7:31,64 --> 1:7:35,277
What the fuck is this?


960
1:7:35,277 --> 1:7:37,913
Here, Keith, you know about
all this computer stuff.


961
1:7:37,913 --> 1:7:44,754
Have a look.


962
1:7:44,754 --> 1:7:47,39
- What's this?
- You fuckin--


963
1:7:47,39 --> 1:7:51,46
You fucking cunt.


964
1:7:51,46 --> 1:7:54,463
Here we go.


965
1:7:54,463 --> 1:7:57,9
"First match:
West Ham v. Birmingham. Home.


966
1:7:57,9 --> 1:8:0,803
Pete brought me to
the Brigid Abbey pub on Walsh Road...


967
1:8:0,803 --> 1:8:3,973
...his main hangout,
and introduced me to his gang."


968
1:8:3,973 --> 1:8:7,977
Oh, look, we're a fucking gang now.


969
1:8:7,977 --> 1:8:11,847
Here, make it go up.


970
1:8:11,847 --> 1:8:14,917
"Bovver is Pete's thuggish
right-hand man.


971
1:8:14,917 --> 1:8:17,653
Keith is sort of Bovver's enforcer."


972
1:8:17,653 --> 1:8:22,792
- You happy now? We're all in there.
- He didn't say nothing about me.


973
1:8:22,792 --> 1:8:24,26
Wait here.


974
1:8:24,26 --> 1:8:28,697
I'll put some clothes on.


975
1:8:28,697 --> 1:8:30,833
So you are the Major?


976
1:8:30,833 --> 1:8:33,769
I was the Major.


977
1:8:33,769 --> 1:8:38,941
I guess to some I still am.


978
1:8:38,941 --> 1:8:42,545
Now, Terry here was my right-hand man
back in the glory days.


979
1:8:42,545 --> 1:8:46,315
That was a long time ago, mate.


980
1:8:46,315 --> 1:8:50,619
Why'd you get out of it?


981
1:8:50,619 --> 1:8:52,888
I was a crazy bastard back then.


982
1:8:52,888 --> 1:8:54,356
All I fucking cared about...


983
1:8:54,356 --> 1:8:57,593
...was my reputation
amongst the firms of England.


984
1:8:57,593 --> 1:9:2,231
I mean, you've heard all the stories
about Millwall, yeah?


985
1:9:2,231 --> 1:9:5,101
Last match I went to
was Millwall, West Ham.


986
1:9:5,101 --> 1:9:7,536
We're talking a good 10 years ago.


987
1:9:7,536 --> 1:9:11,774
I mean, we'd been waiting
for this match all year.


988
1:9:11,774 --> 1:9:13,442
At Millwall. Yeah.


989
1:9:13,442 --> 1:9:16,912
Stepping into their ground.
Completely outnumbered.


990
1:9:16,912 --> 1:9:20,449
We were fucking wired from the start.


991
1:9:20,449 --> 1:9:21,884
Now, Tommy Hatcher...


992
1:9:21,884 --> 1:9:24,987
...he was their main man back then.


993
1:9:24,987 --> 1:9:28,23
He used to bring his 12-year-old boy
to the grounds. Tommy Jr.


994
1:9:28,23 --> 1:9:35,297
Always banging on how he brought his kid
up, you know, to be like a little pit bull.


995
1:9:35,297 --> 1:9:37,66
Well, we lost that match.


996
1:9:37,66 --> 1:9:39,335
Three-nil.


997
1:9:39,335 --> 1:9:44,24
And those Millwall cunts
started laughing at us.


998
1:9:44,24 --> 1:9:49,979
And I just fucking snapped.


999
1:9:49,979 --> 1:9:53,349
I mean, I couldn't let it lie, you know?


1000
1:9:53,349 --> 1:10:19,74
So I assembled all our troops,
and we hunted them down.


1001
1:10:19,74 --> 1:10:22,244
I saw that little lad go down.


1002
1:10:22,244 --> 1:10:25,681
Tommy! No!


1003
1:10:25,681 --> 1:10:35,357
And I saw his skull get crushed
under the boots of the GSE.


1004
1:10:35,357 --> 1:10:38,27
I never went to another match
after that.


1005
1:10:38,27 --> 1:10:46,502
And I left the Major behind.


1006
1:10:46,502 --> 1:10:49,672
And that's when I met your sister.


1007
1:10:49,672 --> 1:10:53,409
She was my angel. She really saved me.


1008
1:10:53,409 --> 1:10:58,781
Showed me a new life.
Helped me forget all this bollocks.


1009
1:10:58,781 --> 1:11:0,916
And she swore...


1010
1:11:0,916 --> 1:11:4,987
...she'd leave me
if I ever returned to it.


1011
1:11:4,987 --> 1:11:6,522
And when it comes back to me--


1012
1:11:6,522 --> 1:11:9,792
And believe me, mate, it fucking does,
that madness.


1013
1:11:9,792 --> 1:11:12,795
I mean, when I hear, you know, the--


1014
1:11:12,795 --> 1:11:16,432
The roar of the stadium on match day, yeah,
all the lads calling me down...


1015
1:11:16,432 --> 1:11:19,535
...to get pissed out of me fucking tree.
When I think of that...


1016
1:11:19,535 --> 1:11:22,4
...I think about getting back into it.


1017
1:11:22,4 --> 1:11:26,976
And Shannon and Ben,
they remind me.


1018
1:11:26,976 --> 1:11:31,28
There's more to life than all this.


1019
1:11:31,28 --> 1:11:34,55
Get all those juicy details, mate?


1020
1:11:34,55 --> 1:11:37,319
- Writing it all down?
- What?


1021
1:11:37,319 --> 1:11:40,789
- You fucking journo cunt!
- Oi!


1022
1:11:40,789 --> 1:11:42,891
Oi! Oi.


1023
1:11:42,891 --> 1:11:45,794
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- He's fucking undercover!


1024
1:11:45,794 --> 1:11:48,797
- Don't tell him nothing!
- I said, are you sure?


1025
1:11:48,797 --> 1:11:51,367
What? You already knew.


1026
1:11:51,367 --> 1:11:54,837
All I know is he studied journalism,
right, at Harvard.


1027
1:11:54,837 --> 1:11:56,472
But he's dropped out.


1028
1:11:56,472 --> 1:11:59,842
We found his journal.
Full of stories about all of us.


1029
1:11:59,842 --> 1:12:1,343
That's just a fucking diary.


1030
1:12:1,343 --> 1:12:4,647
Ned saw you at the Times
with a couple of journos.


1031
1:12:4,647 --> 1:12:8,651
That was my dad. He's the journalist.
You knew that.


1032
1:12:8,651 --> 1:12:11,42
His old man's a fucking journo,
and you knew about it.


1033
1:12:11,42 --> 1:12:13,922
- Look, that don't mean nothing, Bov.
- You what?


1034
1:12:13,922 --> 1:12:16,425
He studies to be a journo.
His old man is a journo.


1035
1:12:16,425 --> 1:12:18,16
What's the fucking difference?


1036
1:12:18,16 --> 1:12:20,195
You let one of them get in with us.


1037
1:12:20,195 --> 1:12:23,799
- I wasn't trying to get anything.
- You shut the--


1038
1:12:23,799 --> 1:12:26,35
I don't care who he is
or what he's done.


1039
1:12:26,35 --> 1:12:29,805
You don't do someone on the deck.


1040
1:12:29,805 --> 1:12:31,674
What's fucking wrong with you, eh?


1041
1:12:31,674 --> 1:12:36,512
He'll bury us all and, what, you just
gonna sit down and watch him do it?


1042
1:12:36,512 --> 1:12:38,347
No.


1043
1:12:38,347 --> 1:12:40,683
No, Steve, you're the Major.


1044
1:12:40,683 --> 1:12:42,251
You started this firm.


1045
1:12:42,251 --> 1:12:45,2
I'm speaking for all the boys,
we got the biggest ruck...


1046
1:12:45,2 --> 1:12:50,626
...of our lives coming up and your brother's
too much of a bottle job to lead us.


1047
1:12:50,626 --> 1:12:53,896
The GSE is Pete's firm. All right?


1048
1:12:53,896 --> 1:13:1,17
He calls the shots.


1049
1:13:1,17 --> 1:13:5,207
Yeah?


1050
1:13:5,207 --> 1:13:8,477
Well, fuck the lot of you.


1051
1:13:8,477 --> 1:13:11,38
GSE?


1052
1:13:11,38 --> 1:13:15,984
Get out of the fucking way! Move!


1053
1:13:15,984 --> 1:13:27,62
Get yourself cleaned up.


1054
1:13:27,62 --> 1:13:30,566
Tommy.


1055
1:13:30,566 --> 1:13:36,972
This is it, mate. We'll finally get back
at those fucking Hammer cunts.


1056
1:13:36,972 --> 1:13:41,377
Millwall! Millwall! Millwall!


1057
1:13:41,377 --> 1:13:46,281
Millwall! Millwall! Millwall!


1058
1:13:46,281 --> 1:13:49,485
Millwall! Millwall!


1059
1:13:49,485 --> 1:13:54,49
- What the fuck's he doing here?
- Martin, sit down, son, sweet.


1060
1:13:54,49 --> 1:13:58,827
- That's it. Do as you're told, you mug.
- Fuck off.


1061
1:13:58,827 --> 1:14:1,196
Bovver.


1062
1:14:1,196 --> 1:14:3,799
You know we're gonna have to stop
meeting like this.


1063
1:14:3,799 --> 1:14:6,568
People are gonna start to talk.


1064
1:14:6,568 --> 1:14:9,872
So, what you doing up so late, anyway,
on a fucking school night?


1065
1:14:9,872 --> 1:14:11,94
Shouldn't you be at home
with your pals...


1066
1:14:11,94 --> 1:14:15,11
...all shitting at the thought
of us turning you over?


1067
1:14:15,11 --> 1:14:19,782
What, did you have a lover's tiff?


1068
1:14:19,782 --> 1:14:24,286
Well, what do you want, Bov?


1069
1:14:24,286 --> 1:14:30,526
Fucking Yank's an undercover journo.


1070
1:14:30,526 --> 1:14:32,94
He's at our boozer now.


1071
1:14:32,94 --> 1:14:34,329
Tommy, you gotta give him the chop.


1072
1:14:34,329 --> 1:14:36,732
He's got them eating
out of the palm of his hand.


1073
1:14:36,732 --> 1:14:42,171
What makes you think I'd want
to sort that out for you, eh?


1074
1:14:42,171 --> 1:14:48,744
Because the Major's there too.


1075
1:14:48,744 --> 1:15:0,823
Stevie Dunham's in there?


1076
1:15:0,823 --> 1:15:2,724
- Oh, thanks, Pete.
- Shut up!


1077
1:15:2,724 --> 1:15:5,894
History student my ass.
Who the fuck are you?


1078
1:15:5,894 --> 1:15:9,97
Look, I'm sorry I lied about
being a history major, but that's it.


1079
1:15:9,97 --> 1:15:12,401
- I'm not a journalist.
- Well, it don't look fucking good, does it?


1080
1:15:12,401 --> 1:15:16,939
- Why are you keeping a record?
- It's a journal. I've kept that my entire life.


1081
1:15:16,939 --> 1:15:19,541
Are you working for the Times?


1082
1:15:19,541 --> 1:15:34,623
No. Look, I'm telling you the truth.
You've gotta trust me, Pete.


1083
1:15:34,623 --> 1:15:38,794
Mate, you've put me
right fucking in it.


1084
1:15:38,794 --> 1:15:40,762
If I don't convince those boys...


1085
1:15:40,762 --> 1:15:45,701
...that the head of their firm was not
just taken by a fucking Yank journo...


1086
1:15:45,701 --> 1:15:51,106
...the GSE is done.


1087
1:15:51,106 --> 1:15:53,75
So I'm gonna go out there...


1088
1:15:53,75 --> 1:15:55,844
...and I'm gonna tell them
that Bov's got it wrong...


1089
1:15:55,844 --> 1:15:58,447
...and that you're one of us.


1090
1:15:58,447 --> 1:16:18,0
And I had better be fucking right.


1091
1:16:18,0 --> 1:16:20,135
So, Bovver...


1092
1:16:20,135 --> 1:16:23,372
...is there anything else
you wanna tell us?


1093
1:16:23,372 --> 1:16:29,144
Listen, Tom, please.
This is how it's gotta go down.


1094
1:16:29,144 --> 1:16:32,8
You're the only one going down,
little Bovver.


1095
1:16:32,8 --> 1:16:36,118
Grass.


1096
1:16:36,118 --> 1:16:38,554
Fuck.


1097
1:16:38,554 --> 1:16:42,758
This shit with Bovver
could tear this firm apart.


1098
1:16:42,758 --> 1:16:44,96
Mate, I need you.


1099
1:16:44,96 --> 1:16:50,766
Stay with us,
just through Millwall.


1100
1:16:50,766 --> 1:16:52,935
I'm not gonna help you.


1101
1:16:52,935 --> 1:16:55,671
I made a promise
to my wife and kids, all right?


1102
1:16:55,671 --> 1:16:58,941
And I'm sticking to it.


1103
1:16:58,941 --> 1:17:1,877
You know, there comes a time...


1104
1:17:1,877 --> 1:17:8,35
...when the best reputation you can have
is the one where your family--


1105
1:17:8,35 --> 1:17:10,986
- What is it?
- Get down. Get the fuck down.


1106
1:17:10,986 --> 1:17:15,958
Hello, boys.


1107
1:17:15,958 --> 1:17:28,971
Jesus.


1108
1:17:28,971 --> 1:17:34,142
Pete. Pete, come on, man!


1109
1:17:34,142 --> 1:17:37,579
Hello, Terry.


1110
1:17:37,579 --> 1:17:43,185
Fuck off!


1111
1:17:43,185 --> 1:17:46,321
Terry.


1112
1:17:46,321 --> 1:17:47,99
Terry.


1113
1:17:47,99 --> 1:17:51,66
Look who's back in the fucking Abbey
after all these years.


1114
1:17:51,66 --> 1:17:54,262
Hello, Tommy.
Tommy, I'm done with all this, mate.


1115
1:17:54,262 --> 1:17:57,399
Retired, did you?
Got yourself a Yank wife, did you?


1116
1:17:57,399 --> 1:17:59,267
Had a son of your own, did you?


1117
1:17:59,267 --> 1:18:0,669
- Listen--
- I had a son once!


1118
1:18:0,669 --> 1:18:2,304
- I'm sorry!
- Do you remember him?


1119
1:18:2,304 --> 1:18:4,6
- You fucking remember?
- I'm sorry!


1120
1:18:4,6 --> 1:18:7,442
It's too late.


1121
1:18:7,442 --> 1:18:10,78
- You bastard.
- Ah, fuck.


1122
1:18:10,78 --> 1:18:15,617
No, Tommy!


1123
1:18:15,617 --> 1:18:18,987
- You listen to me.
- Tommy--


1124
1:18:18,987 --> 1:18:21,123
You die tonight...


1125
1:18:21,123 --> 1:18:35,637
...and me and you are even.


1126
1:18:35,637 --> 1:18:51,92
It's done! Let's go!


1127
1:18:51,92 --> 1:18:54,89
Pete! Pete, over here, mate! Quick!


1128
1:18:54,89 --> 1:19:7,936
Jesus. The fucking punk.


1129
1:19:7,936 --> 1:19:11,973
Bovver, what the fuck did you do?


1130
1:19:11,973 --> 1:19:24,252
Get a fucking car!


1131
1:19:24,252 --> 1:19:31,793
Get him in the fucking--


1132
1:19:31,793 --> 1:19:37,933
Get him the fuck in the car.


1133
1:19:37,933 --> 1:19:40,836
Get in. Go.


1134
1:19:40,836 --> 1:19:43,672
Go! Fucking go!
Get out of the way!


1135
1:19:43,672 --> 1:19:58,22
Move! Move!


1136
1:19:58,22 --> 1:20:1,656
Somebody help!
Help us! He's been fucking stabbed!


1137
1:20:1,656 --> 1:20:5,36
- Come on, hurry!
- Get him on the trolley.


1138
1:20:5,36 --> 1:20:8,497
- Fucking hurry up!
- Resus.


1139
1:20:8,497 --> 1:20:11,233
Go.


1140
1:20:11,233 --> 1:20:40,462
Infuse six units of O-neg.


1141
1:20:40,462 --> 1:20:42,564
What'd he say?


1142
1:20:42,564 --> 1:20:59,815
He's hanging on.


1143
1:20:59,815 --> 1:21:3,84
Trusting lads.


1144
1:21:3,84 --> 1:21:7,622
You always said trusting lads
was my problem, Bov.


1145
1:21:7,622 --> 1:21:9,357
I trust lads too much.


1146
1:21:9,357 --> 1:21:14,95
Trust the Yank too much.


1147
1:21:14,95 --> 1:21:17,666
This is how you prove your point?


1148
1:21:17,666 --> 1:21:20,702
Backstabbing me?


1149
1:21:20,702 --> 1:21:26,174
Teaming up with Tommy Hatcher
to kill the Major?


1150
1:21:26,174 --> 1:21:29,678
Kill my fucking brother?


1151
1:21:29,678 --> 1:21:35,684
I'll kill Tommy.
Just say the word, and I'll do it.


1152
1:21:35,684 --> 1:21:39,454
I don't need you for that.


1153
1:21:39,454 --> 1:21:48,296
I don't need you for anything anymore.


1154
1:21:48,296 --> 1:21:50,966
Go. Away.


1155
1:21:50,966 --> 1:22:33,842
Bruv, please, I fucked up.


1156
1:22:33,842 --> 1:22:36,111
- Shannon. Shannon.
- You asshole. You have to--


1157
1:22:36,111 --> 1:23:25,66
Sick! You're so sick!


1158
1:23:25,66 --> 1:23:31,466
I'm so sorry.


1159
1:23:31,466 --> 1:23:49,284
I know.


1160
1:23:49,284 --> 1:23:53,555
The doctor said
that you're gonna be okay.


1161
1:23:53,555 --> 1:24:4,666
He said it's just gonna take
a little time.


1162
1:24:4,666 --> 1:24:17,679
We're leaving tomorrow.


1163
1:24:17,679 --> 1:24:41,77
It's not safe for us here now.


1164
1:24:41,77 --> 1:24:43,405
- You all right, mate?
- How is he?


1165
1:24:43,405 --> 1:24:45,673
He's hanging in.


1166
1:24:45,673 --> 1:24:47,342
So, what now?


1167
1:24:47,342 --> 1:24:49,778
You let Tommy know
I want a straightener.


1168
1:24:49,778 --> 1:24:52,38
- Tomorrow.
- All right.


1169
1:24:52,38 --> 1:24:55,116
We finish this once and for all.


1170
1:24:55,116 --> 1:24:58,386
Somewhere quiet.
Away from old bill.


1171
1:24:58,386 --> 1:25:0,755
Ike, your mate runs security
at Trinity Wharf?


1172
1:25:0,755 --> 1:25:3,324
- Yeah.
- Get hold of him. Set it up.


1173
1:25:3,324 --> 1:25:6,127
Sure.


1174
1:25:6,127 --> 1:25:25,46
Come on.


1175
1:25:25,46 --> 1:25:26,815
What's going on?


1176
1:25:26,815 --> 1:25:29,818
Ben and I are on the noon flight
to Boston.


1177
1:25:29,818 --> 1:25:32,72
You can't leave him.
He was trying to protect us.


1178
1:25:32,72 --> 1:25:36,24
- You can't do this to him, Shannon.
- Yes, she can.


1179
1:25:36,24 --> 1:25:38,326
She has to.


1180
1:25:38,326 --> 1:25:40,228
So should you.


1181
1:25:40,228 --> 1:25:43,231
I'm going with you
to that wharf tomorrow.


1182
1:25:43,231 --> 1:25:46,835
Jesus Christ.


1183
1:25:46,835 --> 1:25:48,403
They crash our pub.


1184
1:25:48,403 --> 1:25:51,739
- They put your brother in the hospital.
- That ain't your problem.


1185
1:25:51,739 --> 1:25:54,943
What are you talking about?
I've got just as much at stake as you.


1186
1:25:54,943 --> 1:25:57,745
Matt, listen to me.


1187
1:25:57,745 --> 1:26:1,49
It's time to go home.


1188
1:26:1,49 --> 1:26:4,285
I don't know where my home is anymore.


1189
1:26:4,285 --> 1:26:8,323
I think we both know where it ain't.


1190
1:26:8,323 --> 1:26:12,727
Mate, this is my fight.
It's my brother in the hospital.


1191
1:26:12,727 --> 1:26:17,265
I'll take care of Tommy.


1192
1:26:17,265 --> 1:27:6,648
Go home, mate.


1193
1:27:6,648 --> 1:27:13,555
I'm forever blowing bubbles


1194
1:27:13,555 --> 1:27:19,594
Pretty bubbles in the air


1195
1:27:19,594 --> 1:27:23,464
They fly so high


1196
1:27:23,464 --> 1:27:27,368
They reach the sky


1197
1:27:27,368 --> 1:29:33,494
And like--


1198
1:29:33,494 --> 1:29:38,399
You're doing the right thing, Matt.


1199
1:29:38,399 --> 1:29:49,844
Yeah.


1200
1:29:49,844 --> 1:29:53,514
You know that back home,
nobody's gonna care about your rep here.


1201
1:29:53,514 --> 1:30:7,829
You know that, right?


1202
1:30:7,829 --> 1:30:21,709
I'm gonna call a cab.


1203
1:30:21,709 --> 1:30:26,114
- Where's Matt?
- Finally went home.


1204
1:30:26,114 --> 1:30:40,628
Come on.


1205
1:30:40,628 --> 1:30:45,199
This is Charlie-27, MPCP-501,
at Brixton Road.


1206
1:30:45,199 --> 1:31:2,683
Disturbance...


1207
1:31:2,683 --> 1:31:4,786
The cab's on its...


1208
1:31:4,786 --> 1:31:7,588
...way.


1209
1:31:7,588 --> 1:31:11,559
Matt?


1210
1:31:11,559 --> 1:31:17,265
Matt?


1211
1:31:17,265 --> 1:34:52,413
Matt?


1212
1:34:52,413 --> 1:35:11,432
Now, at least one of you Dunham cunts
are gonna pay for my fucking boy.


1213
1:35:11,432 --> 1:35:14,702
Me old mate, Bovver.
Never could turn down a good scrap.


1214
1:35:14,702 --> 1:35:17,438
You know me, bruv.


1215
1:35:17,438 --> 1:35:33,621
Get him up.


1216
1:35:33,621 --> 1:35:35,489
Holy shit.


1217
1:35:35,489 --> 1:35:36,824
Shannon!


1218
1:35:36,824 --> 1:35:38,325
Shannon, stop!


1219
1:35:38,325 --> 1:35:44,365
Shannon, over here!


1220
1:35:44,365 --> 1:35:49,36
Matt, don't be a fucking idiot!
Get her out of here!


1221
1:35:49,36 --> 1:35:50,938
Shannon, stop!


1222
1:35:50,938 --> 1:35:53,74
- Matt!
- Shannon, stop!


1223
1:35:53,74 --> 1:35:55,843
- Pete, what're you doing?
- Fucking hell, Tommy.


1224
1:35:55,843 --> 1:35:57,178
It's Steve Dunham's wife.


1225
1:35:57,178 --> 1:36:0,448
If Tommy reaches that car,
do you know what he'll do to her?


1226
1:36:0,448 --> 1:36:2,183
He's a fucking animal.


1227
1:36:2,183 --> 1:36:4,585
Hello, love.


1228
1:36:4,585 --> 1:36:7,21
Matt!


1229
1:36:7,21 --> 1:36:9,23
Come on, let me in the fucking car!


1230
1:36:9,23 --> 1:36:12,259
Let me in, you slag!
I'll smash this fucking window in!


1231
1:36:12,259 --> 1:36:15,596
I'll smash this fucking window!


1232
1:36:15,596 --> 1:36:23,404
- Are you okay? Is Ben okay?
- Yeah. Matt!


1233
1:36:23,404 --> 1:36:27,541
You're gonna get it now,
you little Yank.


1234
1:36:27,541 --> 1:36:30,144
Bov, you wanna make up
for what you've done?


1235
1:36:30,144 --> 1:36:46,861
Get my brother's family out of here.


1236
1:36:46,861 --> 1:36:48,395
Tommy!


1237
1:36:48,395 --> 1:36:50,664
Don't you want to finish me off, then?


1238
1:36:50,664 --> 1:36:52,633
You're already finished, little Petey.


1239
1:36:52,633 --> 1:36:55,669
The NTO will take care of you
in a minute, you mug.


1240
1:36:55,669 --> 1:36:58,172
We didn't kill your son, Tommy!


1241
1:36:58,172 --> 1:37:0,7
You did!


1242
1:37:0,7 --> 1:37:2,409
You should have protected him, mate!


1243
1:37:2,409 --> 1:37:5,513
He was your son!


1244
1:37:5,513 --> 1:37:10,851
- Don't you talk about my fucking son.
- He was your son, Tommy!


1245
1:37:10,851 --> 1:37:15,222
- Get in the fucking motor! Get in the car!
- Get Pete!


1246
1:37:15,222 --> 1:37:17,925
Only a poor little Hammer!


1247
1:37:17,925 --> 1:37:20,728
His face was all battered and torn!


1248
1:37:20,728 --> 1:37:22,663
He made me feel sick!


1249
1:37:22,663 --> 1:37:24,265
I hit him with a brick!


1250
1:37:24,265 --> 1:37:28,702
Now the cunt's not laughing or singing
No more!


1251
1:37:28,702 --> 1:37:34,742
- He's not laughing or singing--
- No, Tommy, he's had enough!


1252
1:37:34,742 --> 1:37:36,577
I'll get us out of here. Go.


1253
1:37:36,577 --> 1:37:38,813
- You can't leave him.
- Pete!


1254
1:37:38,813 --> 1:37:43,784
Pete!


1255
1:37:43,784 --> 1:39:7,868
Fucking help him!


1256
1:39:7,868 --> 1:39:11,839
Pete Dunham's life taught me
there's a time to stand your ground.


1257
1:39:11,839 --> 1:39:15,776
His death taught me
there's a time to walk away.


1258
1:39:15,776 --> 1:39:18,512
I would never have
the chance to thank him.


1259
1:39:18,512 --> 1:39:52,179
But I could live in a way
that would honor him.


1260
1:39:52,179 --> 1:39:54,815
It's too much.


1261
1:39:54,815 --> 1:39:56,75
Well...


1262
1:39:56,75 --> 1:40:0,2
...congrats on the Epstein
account, Van Holden.


1263
1:40:0,2 --> 1:40:2,356
That should be a nice commish.


1264
1:40:2,356 --> 1:40:5,826
I bet your father's election
had nothing to do with it.


1265
1:40:5,826 --> 1:40:11,265
Fuck you very much, Todd.


1266
1:40:11,265 --> 1:40:14,535
Gentlemen, if you will excuse me...


1267
1:40:14,535 --> 1:40:19,84
...I must partake, once again,
in this restaurant's fine facilities.


1268
1:40:19,84 --> 1:41:2,816
Fucking lucky bastard.


1269
1:41:2,816 --> 1:41:7,621
What the fuck.


1270
1:41:7,621 --> 1:41:9,89
Matt Buckner?


1271
1:41:9,89 --> 1:41:14,261
Is that you?


1272
1:41:14,261 --> 1:41:25,172
Jesus, Matt, you look like shit.


1273
1:41:25,172 --> 1:41:27,841
Hey, Buckner, do you mind?


1274
1:41:27,841 --> 1:41:30,778
- You said you'd hook me up.
- What?


1275
1:41:30,778 --> 1:41:34,48
When I took the fall for you at Harvard,
you said you'd hook me up.


1276
1:41:34,48 --> 1:41:36,55
You gotta be kidding me, man.


1277
1:41:36,55 --> 1:41:39,586
They were your drugs,
and you said you had more to lose...


1278
1:41:39,586 --> 1:41:42,89
- ...and that you'd hook me up if--
- All right!


1279
1:41:42,89 --> 1:41:45,426
Yes, I said I would hook you up.


1280
1:41:45,426 --> 1:41:47,327
Jesus, Matt, I--


1281
1:41:47,327 --> 1:41:49,797
I'm in a meeting right now.


1282
1:41:49,797 --> 1:41:56,67
Call my office. Talk to Cindy.
She'll make an appointment for you.


1283
1:41:56,67 --> 1:42:2,76
You gotta be joking me,
you spineless shit.


1284
1:42:2,76 --> 1:42:5,579
- That you'd hook me up if--
- All right! Yes, I said I would--


1285
1:42:5,579 --> 1:42:7,548
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, this?


1286
1:42:7,548 --> 1:42:10,15
- It's my ticket back to Harvard.
- Give me that.


1287
1:42:10,15 --> 1:42:43,684
I wouldn't do that.


1288
1:42:43,684 --> 1:42:47,287
I'm forever blowing bubbles


1289
1:42:47,287 --> 1:42:50,757
Pretty bubbles in the air


1290
1:42:50,757 --> 1:42:54,928
They fly so high
They reach the sky


1291
1:42:54,928 --> 1:42:58,932
And like my dreams
They fade and die


1292
1:42:58,932 --> 1:43:2,402
Fortune's always hiding


1293
1:43:2,402 --> 1:43:5,706
I've looked everywhere


1294
1:43:5,706 --> 1:43:9,9
I'm forever blowing bubbles


1295
1:43:9,9 --> 1:43:12,146
Pretty bubbles in the air


1296
1:43:12,146 --> 1:43:14,47
United!


1297
1:43:14,47 --> 1:45:14,47
United!
