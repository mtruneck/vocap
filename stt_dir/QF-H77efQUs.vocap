###449 GENERATORS AT THE SAN ONOFRE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON SAYS LAYOFFS
###457 ARE COMING BECAUSE THE REDUCTION OF EMPLOYEES TO 1500 WILL REDUCE OPERATING COSTS WHILE
###464 REGULATORS CONSIDER THE VIABILITY OF THE PLANT. HERE TO TALK ABOUT STAFFING AT NUCLEAR FACILITYSIS
###469 NUCLEAR CONTAINMENT EXPERT AND SDSU PROFESSOR MURRAY JENNEX. YOU WORKED AT THE SAN ONOFRE
###478 GENERATING STATION FOR 20 YEARS, YOU ALSO WROTE A PAPER ON WHO TO HIRE AND WHO TO LAYOFF
###487 AT NUCLEAR FACILITIES. SHOULD WE ALL BE SURPRISED BY THESE LAYOFFS? >> >>MURRAY JENNEX: NOT
###491 AT ALL. REMEMBER THEY JUST GOT DONE ADDING THE GENERATORS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. THEY
###498 KEPT THAT STAFFED BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM OF THIS OUTAGE. THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN
###504 GONE HAD THIS ISSUE NOT COME UP. >> >>PEGGY: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON TOLD US THEY WERE
###510 NOT DOING ON AIR INTERVIEWS AT THIS TIME, BUT THEY HAVE AN UPDATE ON THE PROGRESS SAYING
###516 THEY ARE DEFUELING UNIT THREE AND DO NOT EXPECT TO SUBMIT AN ACTION LETTER ON THOSE REPAIRS
###522 BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. MURRAY, DOES DEFUELING UNIT THREE MEAN THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT
###529 TO DO TWHIS REACTOR OR SOMETHING ELSE? >> >>MURRAY JENNEX: ACTUALLY T MEANS THAT THEY'RE PUT
###533 TG INTO A LOW COST MAINTENANCE SITUATION. THE DEFUELING REDUCES THE STAFFING REQUIREMENT
###539 TO OPERATE OR MAINTAIN THE PLANT. THIS IS A VERY NORMAL ACTIVITY THAT THEY DO EVERY
###544 REFUELING ANYWAY. >> >>PEGGY: AND THEY NEED TO DEFUEL IN ORDER TO MAKE THE REPAIRS AS
###548 WELL. >> >>MURRAY JENNEX: THEY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO, BUT BY DEFUELING, IT MAKES IT A LOT
###554 EASIER TO DO THE MAINTENANCE. >> >>PEGGY: THERE'S RADIOACTIVE WASTE, OR FUEL AS IT'S
###559 CALLED, AT THE PLANT. WHERE WILL THAT BE STORED DURING THIS DEFUELING OR WHERE WILL IT BE
###564 KEPT? >> >>MURRAY JENNEX: THEY HAVE A FUEL BUILDING THAT'S DESIGNED TO HOLD THE FUEL
###568 WHEN THEY TAKE IT OUT, AND IT ALSO HOLDS THE HOTTEST WASTE. >> >>PEGGY: IS THERE ENOUGH
###573 ROOM THERE TO STORE >> >>MURRAY JENNEX: ABSOLUTELY, FOR NOW THERE IS. >> >>PEGGY: OKAY, SO SOUTHERN
###578 CALIFORNIA EDISON SAYS THEY HAVEN'T DETERMINED WHICH DEPARTMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE
###583 LAYOFFS. IN CASES LIKE THIS, WHAT DO YOU SUSPECT? ARE THERE CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO TYPICALLY GET
###590 LAID OFF FROM NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS? >> >>MURRAY JENNEX: THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE BROUGHT IN
###593 FOR OUTAGES OR SPECIAL PROJECTS. IF THEY'RE GOING TO CUT INTO PERMANENT STAFF, THEY WU
###602 WOULD LOOK AT WHAT THE KNOWLEDGE NEEDS CAPABILITIES ARE TO OPERATE THE PLANT AS THEY EXPECT TO
###608 SEE IT. THEY WILL DO AN ANALYSIS TO SEE WHICH EXPERTISE THEY CAN USE. >> >>PEGGY: SOUTHERN
###614 CALIFORNIA EDISON SAYS THE DOWN SIZING EFFORT STARTED ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE THEIR
###618 STAFFING COSTS WERE HIGHER THAN SIMILAR PLANTS. IS THAT SOMETHING THEY DO ROUTINELY, A FINANCIAL
###626 EVALUATIONS FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS OR FOR WHOMEVER? >> >>MURRAY JENNEX: ACTUALLY, IT IS. THEY
###630 STARTED DOING A BENCH MARKING EXERCISE IN ABOUT THE YEAR 2000. SINCE THEN THEY'VE BEEN
###635 ON GOING. ALL THE PLANTS COMPARE THEMSELVES. NUCLEAR INDUSTRY LOOKS AT THEMSELVES AS COMPETITORS
###643 WITH OTHER POWER PRODUCING INDUSTRIES. >> >>PEGGY: TYPICALLY YOU SAID A PLANT THIS SIZE WOULD
###648 HAVE ABOUT 1300 EMPLOYES AND WE HAVE 1500. >> >>MURRAY JENNEX: THEY COULD PROBABLY GO
###654 WITH 1300. WHAT I EXPECT THEY'RE DOING IS ALLOWING NATURAL ATTRITION TO LOWER IT MORE.
###661 >> >>PEGGY: DO YOU THINK THE LAYOFFS COMBINED WITH THE TUBE ISSUES IS POINTING TO A PERMANENT
###665 SHUT DOWN OF THE PLANT? >> >>MURRAY JENNEX: I DON'T THINK YOU CAN READ THAT AT ALL. I
###668 THEY DON'T THINK THEY'RE LOWERING THE COSTS TO BE PRUDENT, WHICH IS WHAT THE RATE PAYERS
###671 WOULD EXPECT. I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND POLITICALLY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET UNITED THREE RUNNING
###676 RIGHT AWAY, AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING AN ON GOING ECONOMIC ANALYSIS TO SEE
###685 WHAT IS THE MOST PRUDENT ACTIVITY TO DO WITH THE UNIT. >> >>PEGGY: WE'RE OFTEN TOLD THERE'S
###690 A STRAIN ON OUR POWER GRID, NO ROLLING BLACKOUTS, BROWN OUTS, WE HAVE THE SUN RISE POUR LINK,
###699 THE TURBINES IN MEXICO. DO WE NEED SAN ONOFRE ANYMORE? >> >>MURRAY JENNEX: WELL, THE NEED
###706 IS MORE ECONOMIC THAN IT IS, I GUESS, FROM A PURE POWER REQUIREMENT. THE POWER LINK HAS
###713 DEFINITELY IMPROVED POWER RELIABILITY IN SAN DIEGO. BUT SAN ONOFRE HAS BEEN A LOW COST
###718 PROVIDER FOR MANY YEARS. PLUS THE CONCERN I STILL HAVE IS I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE
###723 A LARGE AREA WITH A LARGE POPULATION AND NOT HAVE SOME POWER PRODUCTION LOCAL. RIGHT NOW,
###730 WE'RE RELYING ON EXTERNAL SOURCES. THAT WON'T ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE. >> >>PEGGY: ALL RIGHT.
###734 WELL, WE'VE RUN OUT OF TIME. THERE'S MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS AND WHAT IT COULD MEAN
###738 AS FAR AS FOR TAX PAYERS AND RATE PAYERS ON OUR WEBSITE. MURRAY JENNEX, THANKS SO MUCH
###743 FOR BEING HERE. >> >>DWANE: IT WAS INSPECTION DAY FOR DIESEL TRUCKS HEADED SOUTH OF THE
###749 BORDER, HIGHWAY PATROL WORKED WITH AGENTS FROM THE STATE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TESTING

###763 OF THE PLUMBING AND PLANTED NEW FLOWER. THE POND WAS DAMAGED TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN HUNDREDS
###768 OF FOLKS STAGE AD LATE NIGHT WATER GUN FIGHT. REPAIRS ARE SCHEDULED AT A COST OF ABOUT 19,000
###780 DOLLARS. >> >>DWANE: THE PASS RATE FOR CALIFORNIA'S HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAM INCREASED SLIGHTLY FOR
###795 SAN DIEGO TENTH GRADERS THIS YEAR. THE SCORES FOR SAN DIEGO UNIFIED WERE AN IMPROVEMENT
###800 OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S CLASS. EIGHTY SIX% OF STUDENTS PASSED THE MATH PORTION WHILE
###806 83% PASSED THE ENGLISH SECTION OF THE TEST. THE STATE WIDE AVERAGE WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER
###811 FOR MATH AND ENGLISH, 84 AND 83% RESPECTIVELY. THE SCORES WERE SLOIT SLIGHTLY HIGHER AT OTHER
###817 SCHOOL UZ CROSS SAN DIEGO COUNTY. CALIFORNIA'S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SAYS 95% OF THE CLASS
###822 OF 2012 STATE WIDE HAVE PASSED THE EXIT EXAM. KEEPING KIDS FROM DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL HAS
###828 GONE HIGH TECH THANKS TO A NEW SOFTWARE PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY A PROFESSOR AT SAN DIEGO STATE.
###835 PEGGY PICO HAS MORE. >> >>PEGGY: THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR IS NEARLY UPON US, AND THAT'S A PROBLEM
###840 FOR MANY HIGH RISK LEARNERS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY ABOUT 10% OF STUDENTS DROP OUT OF SCHOOL EACH
###846 YEAR. BUT THAT MAY CHANGE FOR THE BETTER THANKS TO A NEW COMPUTER PROGRAM CREATED BY MY GUEST,
###851 DR. ROBERT BRIGGS, A PROFESSOR AT SDSU'S COLLEGE OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. DR. BRIGGS, HOW
###858 DO YOU GET A STUDENT TO BE ENGAGED IN AND STAY IN SCHOOL? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: BOTTOM
###866 LINE IS YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING THEY CARE ABOUT AND USE THAT AGAINST THEM. >> >>PEGGY:
###871 SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS RELEVANT TO THEM. >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: INDEED. >> >>PEGGY: HOW DO YOU DISCOVER
###876 WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO THEM AND WHAT'S RELEVANT? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: YOU HAVE TO ASK THEM.
###880 WHEN WE STARTED THE PROJECT IN THE D. C. PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE WERE ASKING THE STUDENTS WHY THEY
###884 WERE DROPPING OUT. ONE CHILD SAID I GOT ON THE WRONG SIDE OF A GANG, I MAY NOT GET HOME
###890 TONIGHT IF. IF I DO GET HOME, I DON'T KNOW IF MY MOM'S GOING TO BE STRUNG OUT ON HEROIN,
###893 AND IF SHE IS STRUNG OUT, I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL GET ANYTHING TO EAT UNTIL MONDAY. WHAT
###901 DO I CARE WHAT 7 TIMES 5 IS. >> >>PEGGY: YOU TOOK THAT INFORMATION AND WHAT'D YOU DO WITH
###904 THAT? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: WE DECIDED INSTEAD OF PRI PREPARING STUDENTS FOR A FUTURE THEY
###908 DIDN'T BELIEVE IN, WE SHOULD PUT THEM TO WORK ON PROBLEMS THEY HAVE A STAKE IN RIGHT NOW.
###914 WE REASONED THAT IF WE DID THAT THAT WOULD MOTIVATE TO LEARN, WE WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE
###918 THOSE PROBLEMS SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO LEARN WHAT WE WANTED THEM TO KNOW TO GET WHAT
###921 THEY WANT. >> >>PEGGY: A STUDENT SITS DOWN, AND WHAT DOES THIS PROGRAM OFFER THEM? >> >>ROBERT
###930 BRIGGS: IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO BE USED IN BUSINESS AND IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE THERE.
###937 AND WE USED IT TO MAKE PROBLEM SOLVING TIME MUCH SORT SHORTER. >> >>PEGGY: WALK US THROUGH
###942 IT. >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: AN EXAMPLE, THE CHILDREN DIDN'T WANT TO STUDY HISTORY, SO I SUGGESTED
###947 TO THEM HISTORY MIGHT BE A SHORT CUT FOR ACHIEVING GREATNESS. WE PUT THEM INTO A BRAIN STORMING
###953 SESSION, WHO ARE YOUR FAVORITE HEROS FROM HISTORY, THEY GENERATE AD LIST, WE SAID VOTE
###958 ON IT, WHO DO YOU WANT TO LOOK AT RIGHT NOW, THEY CHOSE MARTIN LUTHER KING, I SAID GREAT,
###962 LET'S BRAIN STORM, WHAT MAKES HIM GREAT, THEY GENERATED A LIST OF 13 ATTRIBUTES OF GREATNESS,
###968 THEN WE'RE GOING TO WRITE A POEM PO EM, SPEED POETRY, WE MADE A RACE,. >> >>PEGGY: SO THEY
###980 FOUND THIS TO BE RELEVANT, THE SUCCESS RATE >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: IT WAS THEIR HERO AND
###987 THEIR INCITES AND THEIR WORK, WHICH THEN, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A POEM THAT DIDN'T EXIST
###991 WHEN THEY CAME IN THAT MORNING. SO THAT WORKED. WE RAN PROJECTS LIKE THAT OVER A COURSE OF
###996 TWO YEARS AND AT THE END OF TWO YEARS, THEY WERE TWO YEARS AHEAD OF THEIR PEER ON READING
###1001 AND WRITING SCORES AND THEY WERE OFF THE CHARTS ON CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING SCORES. >> >>PEGGY:
###1006 HOW IS THE CLASSROOM TEACHER IN THIS? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: THE CLASSROOM TEACHER CAN LEAD THE
###1011 EXERCISES, AND THE CLASSROOM TEACHER HAS TO GET TO KNOW WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT SO SHE CAN
###1016 PICK THE PROBLEMS U.YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO DO SOME TRAINING FOR TEACHERS? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS:
###1020 WE DID, WE HAD A SUCCESS ACADEMICALLY AND A FAILURE TRANSFERRING TO THE TEACHERS. >> >>PEGGY:
###1029 HOW COME? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: IT TOOK US 20 YEARS OF RESEARCH LEADING UP UNTIL JUST ABOUT
###1036 A MONTH AGO BEFORE WE FELT WE WERE READY TO GO BACK INTO THE CLASSROOMS. >> >>PEGGY: DOES
###1040 THE SOFTWARE COME WITH A TEACHER COMPONENT, SO A TRAINING COMPONENT? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS:
###1046 THE GOAL WAS TO DESIGN THE SOFTWARE SO IT COULD BE RUN BY PEOPLE WITH NO TRAINING. >> >>PEGGY:
###1053 DO YOU INCORPORATE STANDARD CURRICULUM? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: WE DON'T INCORPORATE A CURRICULUM,
###1057 BUT WE COVER THE SAME MATERIAL WITH A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF TEACHING APPROACH. >> >>PEGGY:
###1064 HOW CAN A SCHOOL DISTRICT IF THEY WANT IT, GET THE PROGRAM, AND HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
###1068 >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: RIGHT NOW, THE SOFTWARE IS FREE, BUT IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE SOFTWARE,
###1072 IT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH IT. WE'RE RUNNING A PILOTED PROGRAM IN CHICAGO, WE'RE GOING
###1077 TO START THAT UP THIS COMING YEAR. IF THAT PILOT PROKING PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL Y HAVE
###1082 A TEACHER IN SAN DIEGO AND ONE IN TUCSON, TO TEST IT. IF THAT GOES WELL, WE DO SOME
###1091 PROOF OF VALUE RESEARCH IN A NUMBER OF CLASSROOMS IN A NUMBER OF CITIES. >> >>PEGGY: HOW DOES
###1096 IT FEEL TO BE SOMEBODY WHO DEVELOPED SOMETHING THAT CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE SO MANY STUDENTS
###1102 LIVES? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: IT'S SO EXCITING, FEELING WE'RE RIGHT ON THE BRING TO MAKE THIS
###1107 HAPPEN. WE FIEMY HAVE A WAY TO MAKE IF ACCESSIBLE TO TEACHER WHICH MAKES IT ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS
###1112 SO VERY EXCITING. >> >>PEGGY: THANK YOU DR. BRIGS. >> >>DWANE: NOW STANDARDIZED TESTING
###1120 HAS ITS CRITICS. THEY SAY ITS FOCUS ON BASIC READING AND MATH SKILLS HAS CROWDED SUBJECTS
###1125 LIKE ART AND SCIENCE OUT OF MANY SCHOOLS. KYLA CALVERT TELLS US CALIFORNIA'S STARTING
###1131 TO ROLL OUT NEW CURRICULUM STANDARDS THIS YEAR, AND SOME FOLKS HOPE IT WILL BRING ART
###1136 BACK TO THE CLASSROOM. >> >>: THERE ARE ABOUT 20 TEACHERS AT THIS REHEARSAL STUDENT. THE
###1144 HALF FACING THE BACK OF THE ROOM ARE DRAWING AND THE REST CAN SEE A PICTURE PROJECTED ON
###1148 TO A SCREEN. TERRY MILLER IS DOING HER BEST TO DESCRIBE WHAT SHE SEES SO HER PARTNER CAN
###1154 SKETCH A REPLICA OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE THE REMNANTS OF A MINING OPERATION. AFTER A FEW MINUTES
###1164 OF DRAWING, MARVA CAPPELLO A SAN DIEGO STATE PROFESSOR LEADING THE CLASS TELLS THOSE DRAWING
###1169 TO TURN AROUND AND SEE THE IMAGE THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO O REPRODUCE. VOLUNTARY NATIONAL
###1186 STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. CALIFORNIA IS JOINING 44 OF THEM IN WASHINGTON D.C. AND
###1191 ADOPTING THE MATH ASK LANG LANGUAGE ARTS STANDARD. THE SKILLS INCLUDE HIGHER ORDER SKILLS TOO.
###1202 >> >>: THESE ARE DIFFERENT IN THAT THERE'S A FOCUS ON CRITICAL THINKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING,
###1208 THAT REALLY WASN'T IN THE CONTENT STANDARD BEFORE. THERE ARE A FEW INSTRUCTIONAL SHIFTS
###1215 WE HELP TEACHERS COME TO TERMS WITH. >> >>: BEFORE IT'S TIME TO GO BACK TO CLASS, EDUCATORS FROM
###1220 ACROSS SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPEND A WEEK AT LOCAL CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE LA JOLLA PLAY
###1224 HOUSE LEARNING HOW THEY CAN INCORPORATE THE ARTS INTO THEIR NORMAL CURRICULUM. THIS DRAWING
###1232 EXERCISE IS ONE PART OF THE EXERCISE. THE TEACHERS VISITED THE TIMKEN, MINGEI, AND PHOTOGRAPHIC
###1242 ARTS MUSEUMS IN BALBOA PARK. IN ANOTHER WORK SHOP, THE TEACHERS ARE ROLE PLAYING WHERE
###1247 THEY DI D SCRIBE DIFFERENT ARTIFACTS. LAURA SLOAN IS TRYING TO USE MESSAGES LIKE THIS
###1260 TO GET KIDS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF LANGUAGE TO USE WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND IN DIFFERENT
###1265 SITUATIONS. >> >>: IT HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ALL MY
###1273 KIDS CAN BE SUCCESSFUL USING THE STRATEGIES, EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM REGARDLESS OF THEIR
###1279 LABELS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR READING LEVELS OR THEIR ENGLISH LANGUAGE FOR PROFICIENCY.
###1285 >> >>: COLLEEN TEACHES FOURTH GRADE AT CRAVER. >> >>: A LOT OF THINGS I THINK I CAN USE WITH
###1295 FOURTH GRADE HI OIR, IS THE CALIFORNIA HISTORY, WITH OUR SCIENCE STANDARDS, THAT I THINK WE'LL
###1301 BE REALLY ENGAGING FOR THE KIDS AND ALSO TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT. >> >>: CAPPELLO
###1309 SAYS THERE AREN'T THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO BE WRONG WITH THE KIND OF ARTS FOK OWS LESSONS
###1313 SHE'S INTRODUCING TEACHERS TO. EACH STOONT CAN PARTICIPATE IN SOME WAY. >> >>: I THINK
###1322 THEY'RE MUCH MORE ENGAGED, MUCH MORE ACCOUNTABLE, BECAUSE EACH STUDENT IS BEING ASKED TO DO
###1329 SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE ABLE DO DO. WE HAVE TAKEN SO MUCH ART OUT OF THE SCHOOL THAT AT
###1333 LEAST WE GET A LITTLE CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING ARTISTIC AND HANDS ON AND I THINK EACH KID
###1342 IS ABLE TO DO UP TO THEIR LEVEL WHAT THEY CAN DO. >> >>: CAPPELLO SAYS ITSELF JUST ABOUT
###1348 BUSY WORK OR HAVING FUN IN CLASSES. >> >>: HELPING STUDENTS USE ORAL AND WRITTEN LANGUAGE ALONG
###1353 WITH PRINT HELPS THEM GET TO A DEEPER LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING. IT REALLY ENHANCES COMPREHENSION. >> >>: GETTING
###1365 ARTS BACK INTO MORE SCHOOLS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FOLK OS F CARE, WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP
###1370 OF THE INSTITUTES HOSTING THIS SEMINAR. THEY TRY ESPECIALLY TO REACH TEACHERS IN LOW INCOME
###1378 COMMUNITIES WHERE ARTS PROGRAMS ARE LEAST LIKELY TO HAVE SURVIVED. >> >>: NOT ONLY IS
###1383 THERE A PROBLEM OF DECLINING RESOURCES IN PUBLIC EDUCATION, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE
###1390 ARE SEVERAL OUTCOMES THAT HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF HAVING EXPOSURE TO THE ARTS. MANY OF THOSE
###1396 ARE IMPORTANT TO A 20TH CENTURY WORK FORCE N CLUING CRITICAL THINKING. >> >>: TERRY MILLER
###1405 IS AN ARTS TEACHER. SHE'S HOPING THE COMMON CORE STANDARDS WILL OFFER A WAY TO PROTECT
###1412 PROGRAMS LIKE HERS. >> >>: I THINK I GAINED AMMUNITION SO THAT WHEN THE BUDGET NEEDS TO
###1419 BE CUT, I CAN SAY HEY, MY STUDENTS ARE WRITING, NIE STUDENTS ARE SPEAKING, MY STUDENTS ARE
###1425 LISTENING, MY STUDENTS ARE READING, MY STUDENTS DEAL WITH SUBTEXT AND INFERENCE, AND SO IT
###1432 MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CUT IT OUT. >> >>: THIS FALL CAPPELLO WILL TAKE TIME AWAY FROM TEACHING
###1436 TO DISCOVER HOW VISUALIZING THINGS IN THE CLASSROOM HELPS STUDENTS WITH LITERACY SKILLS.
###1464 >> >>PEGGY: IN TONIGHT'S PUBLIC SQUARE FUNDING CUTS WILL FORCE THE CLOSURE OF THREE CAMP
