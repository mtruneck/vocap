###0 [MUSIC]
###12 BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah.
###13 This pretty much has been my playground
###15 for the past 15 years.
###20 I started renting snowmobiles down the road and looking for
###26 rideable terrain.
###28 SHANE GRIMES: So do you think you were some of the first
###30 snowboarders out here?
###31 BRYAN IGUCHI: Pretty much, yeah.
###34 To snowboard in this area?
###35 For sure.
###36 WILLIE MCMILLON: Growing up here in the back country, we
###39 probably rode for seven, eight years without a transceiver,
###43 without a probe, even backpacks.
###48 We just carried our board way out in the middle of--
###51 I mean, we had no idea what we were doing.
###52 I feel really safe going out in the back country with him.
###56 He knows his shit.
###57 And it's just like, tell me what to do, dude.
###61 BRYAN IGUCHI: First I'm trying to identify any weak layers in
###64 the snow path.
###65 So looking here, I see here is a layer.
###69 I want to test this layer.
###70 This is the new snow that we had in the
###72 last couple of days.
###75 And first, let's check densities.
###78 So this is the kind of layer I'm looking at right here.
###81 If I want to test that, I do a compression tap test.
###86 MIKE RANQUET: Bryan Iguchi definitely embodies or
###89 epitomizes the Jackson Hole rider.
###93 In the mid to late '90s, he just disappeared there without
###99 a plan, just went there to get away to the mountains.
###101 And that's one of the few places, I think, in the United
###104 States where you can still do that without the Mickey Mouse
###109 hype of major ski areas.
###115 BRYAN IGUCHI: OK.
###116 So now I'm just isolating a column of snow and then
###123 cutting it back.
###124 So this is a free-standing block of snow.
###127 I'm going to do a shovel tap test and look for any shears.
###132 
###135 One.
###136 I've got immediate shearing, I got an easy shear.
###140 BJORN LEINES: Down about eight inches?
###141 BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah.
###142 I'd say down 20 centimeters.
###145 OK, really soft, so I'm guessing a
###148 storm interface layer.
###150 One.
###151 
###154 Four.
###155 
###159 WILLIE MCMILLON: I think a lot of the pros these days like--
###163 a lot of what I see is these kids growing up in the park.
###167 And then they're like, wow, I'm making a lot of money.
###169 I guess I've got to learn how to ride powder now.
###172 And then they go out in the back country.
###173 And it's like they can't ride a sled.
###175 They don't know how to dig a pit.
###177 They probably can't even find a transceiver buried in the
###180 yard, you know?
###181 And I think he's kind of the regulator of that.
###186 If these crews come out, he's not going to let kids
###189 get away with that.
###189 He's going to make them find a peeps in his yard before he
###194 takes them out.
###195 
###198 BJORN LEINES: Solid underneath.
###199 SHANE GRIMES: Are you counting your packs?
###200 BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah.
###202 None of them are interesting.
###204 BJORN LEINES: This typically is more of a continental snow
###207 pack up here where we are?
###209 BRYAN IGUCHI: It's more inner mountain to some of the
###211 washouts down at the Tetons.
###212 But here, it's more like Colorado style.
###216 It's colder, hollow, [INAUDIBLE].
###217 BJORN LEINES: Yeah, you know that.
###218 BRYAN IGUCHI: Not as much snow.
###220 BJORN LEINES: Right.
###222 BRYAN IGUCHI: Well, I wouldn't want to be riding those big
###224 lines over there.
###225 BJORN LEINES: Fuck no.
###227 I wouldn't want to be out on anything hanging or anything
###231 not supported.
###232 BRYAN IGUCHI: Hear that crust layer there?
###234 WILLIE MCMILLON: A lot of times we're not
###236 into it, you know?
###237 We'll go out, and he'll be like, let's dig a pit.
###239 And you're just like, dude, seriously?
###241 And we'll dig a nine-foot pit.
###244 And then we're worked.
###244 And we can't even strap in, you know?
###247 But he's diligent about it.
###250 BRYAN IGUCHI: OK, I'm guessing it's going to pop
###251 somewhere in here.
###252 
###254 BJORN LEINES: What's that?
###255 
###258 BRYAN IGUCHI: Let's see if I can--
###259 this is such a delicate block.
###262 Oh, OK.
###263 Oh, I'm seeing surface over here.
###265 Oh, no, these are preserved stellars.
###267 If you come here and look at this.
###270 BJORN LEINES: Those are-- yeah.
###271 BRYAN IGUCHI: That's a storm
###271 interface, perfectly preserved.
###274 OK.
###275 BJORN LEINES: Mm-hm.
###276 Look at how huge they are.
###276 BRYAN IGUCHI: I know.
###278 BJORN LEINES: Those didn't get big, they just--
###279 BRYAN IGUCHI: They just melt right away.
###279 BJORN LEINES: Mm-hm.
###280 BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah, you see how they [INAUDIBLE].
###282 So basically, it's a storm interface layer.
###285 So it was a temperature change or whatever.
###288 A little density change there.
###290 BJORN LEINES: This is what you don't want, one from the hand.
###293 And it's easy style of breaking off.
###295 BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah.
###298 DAVE DOWNING: Jackson Hole?
###299 Yeah.
###299 I think it's always been kind of a rad place to
###303 snowboard, you know?
###304 A lot of old Fall Line films are filmed in Jackson Hole.
###306 And then there's always cycles in snowboarding, like certain
###310 places become popular, you know?
###311 And then they kind of fade off, you know?
###313 One year it might be Colorado.
###315 One year it might be Utah, Tahoe.
###318 And right now, I think a lot of people are
###319 going to Jackson Hole.
###321 They're having a killer winter.
###322 And so a lot of people are going there.
###323 [LAUGHS]
###325 KEVIN JONES: His progression is always a step ahead.
###328 Pretty soon, I think, it's going to be protocol that all
###331 these riders that are venturing in the back country,
###334 but they don't know things about the back country.
###336 It's like this white stuff that you love, it can kill you
###341 very easily on the wrong day.
###344 And Guch, you know, everybody he's around, it's like just
###349 having him around makes the whole crew more aware of
###353 what's going on around us.
###354 BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah, OK.
###356 This is a crystal screen in a loop.
###358 So it's a magnifying glass.
###361 You just look to see what the snow crystals that the failure
###363 surface is on.
###365 Yeah, it's definitely some old surface hoar.
###368 TRAVIS RICE: It's one thing if you're just going out and
###370 riding and having fun.
###371 But if you're trying to shoot with photographers or film,
###375 man, it's a whole other dynamic.
###376 You've got to time things right with what time of day
###379 you should be at certain places.
###381 The snow's bad here.
###382 You should try here, all the different zones that surround
###385 this area here in Jackson.
###387 And for me, for two years, it was amazing being lucky enough
###392 to ride here locally with a guy like Guch who had put in a
###396 bunch of years all by himself, basically, trying to figure it
###399 out for himself.
###400 KEVIN JONES: Safety is huge.
###402 I mean, he's watched one of his friends die right in front
###404 of his eyes, you know?
###406 When Tristan died, that same year Craig Kelly died and Jeff
###410 Anderson died.
###411 It was like, holy shit.
###414 I guess, all of a sudden, it isn't just
###415 happening to other people.
###416 It's people within our--
###418 this is really hitting home now, you know?
###422 BRYAN IGUCHI: It's a lot more reactive here than it is in
###425 the Tetons.
###425 SHANE GRIMES: Yeah?
###426 BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah.
###427 It's all changes in whether.
###429 That's a really firm block of snow.
###431 
###434 SHANE GRIMES: So that was a couple of storms ago, a real
###436 heavy, wet one?
###438 BRYAN IGUCHI: And you see all that?
###438 It's just like facets, like sugar.
###443 So you could propagate--
###444 it could step down further down.
###449 It's definitely not a good looking snow pack.
###452 I wouldn't want to go on anything too big or anything
###457 with a high consequence.
###459 I feel good about just small landings, jumps and things
###462 we've been doing.
###463 But I wouldn't want to ride too many big lines.
###465 SHANE GRIMES: Yeah.
###465 BRYAN IGUCHI: No, I wouldn't want to ride
###466 any big lines here.
###469 Like I wouldn't go in there right now.
###470 PAT BRIDGES: A lot of people say, why doesn't snowboard
###474 media focus as much attention on the pedigree of the sport
###479 or what the legends are doing now or guys who are 40 years
###483 old and pro still and stuff?
###487 Well, the guys who are 40 and pro still don't ride like Guch
###490 does or as much as Guch does.
###492 Or they've stopped progressing or evolving themselves.
###495 He never stopped.
###497 SHANE GRIMES: So we're going to hit some small jumps, or
###500 jump with protected landings.
###503 Try to keep this safe.
###504 BRYAN IGUCHI: Try, yeah.
###506 PAT BRIDGES: It just so happens, because of his stoke
###509 on riding, he's gone from riding in Jackson Hole with
###514 guys like Lance Pittman and Willie McMillon to riding with
###517 the next generations of Jackson riders like the Rices
###523 and Mark Carters and to ride in the next generation of
###527 Jackson Hole riders.
###528 And that's just because he's in the lift line and he's
###530 riding every day.
###531 BILLY ANDERSON: He's just dedicated.
###534 And I think that that's gotten him to where he is, is he
###537 loves snowboarding.
###539 And I think he was really committed, coming from a
###542 pretty hard core skate and surf background in Los Angeles
###547 and taking that to the snow.
###549 He kind of had not a chip on his shoulder, but he was tough
###552 and focused.
###553 BRYAN IGUCHI: Well, for a few years now I've just start
###556 taking some more advanced avalanche courses.
###559 I did my Level 1 in Canada at the
###562 Professional Operations class.
###563 I'm trying to get my head wrapped around more of the
###565 science part of it.
###568 You get experience in the mountains.
###570 And you kind of get a feeling for what's going on and make
###574 decisions on what you've seen in the past.
###578 You get an idea of what signs to look out for.
###582 
###585 I'm on more of a mission now to quantify what
###587 I'm seeing and why.
###588 So I'm getting more into looking at the structure of
###591 the snow pack and looking at the more
###594 scientific part of it.
###596
