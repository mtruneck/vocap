BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:
We haven`t finished everything we set out


2
0:0:16,7 --> 0:0:22,83
to do in 2008, but you know that every single
day that I set foot in that office, I am thinking


3
0:0:22,83 --> 0:0:29,34
about you. I am fighting for your families.
And with your help, I`ve been keeping the


4
0:0:29,34 --> 0:0:31,279
commitments that I made.


5
0:0:31,279 --> 0:0:35,39
MITT ROMNEY, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The
Obama campaign is slipping, because it can`t


6
0:0:35,39 --> 0:0:39,72
find an agenda to help the American families.
But our campaign is growing into a movement


7
0:0:39,72 --> 0:0:43,33
across this country that says we`re going
to get America back, we`re going to get America


8
0:0:43,33 --> 0:0:45,14
strong, we`re going to provide for our families.


9
0:0:45,14 --> 0:0:45,809
(END VIDEO CLIP)


10
0:0:45,809 --> 0:0:49,269
CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Powerful words from
the candidates. Today we`re going to look


11
0:0:49,269 --> 0:0:54,72
at their campaigns` big push with less than
two weeks to go until election day. I`m Carl


12
0:0:54,72 --> 0:0:58,32
Azuz. Welcome to CNN STUDENT NEWS.


13
0:0:58,32 --> 0:1:2,64
Visiting four states might sound like a full
vacation. You pack up your car, spend a few


14
0:1:2,64 --> 0:1:7,1
days in each spot. If you`re a presidential
candidate, that`s not a one-week trip. You


15
0:1:7,1 --> 0:1:12,57
do that in a day. From now through November
6th, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama will be


16
0:1:12,57 --> 0:1:17,24
all over the country. This is what former
Governor Mitt Romney`s day looked like yesterday


17
0:1:17,24 --> 0:1:21,85
-- moving around the state of Ohio, visiting
campaign rallies in three different cities.


18
0:1:21,85 --> 0:1:28,28
So Thursday in Ohio, on Tuesday he was in
Colorado, Iowa on Wednesday, plus visits to


19
0:1:28,28 --> 0:1:33,34
Nevada, Florida and Virginia were scheduled
for this week as well. President Obama just


20
0:1:33,34 --> 0:1:38,39
wrapped up a campaign trip that took him to
eight states in 48 hours. Wednesday, he went


21
0:1:38,39 --> 0:1:44,119
to Iowa, Colorado, Nevada and California.
On Thursday, he started the day in Florida,


22
0:1:44,119 --> 0:1:49,619
and then hit Virginia, Illinois and Ohio before
heading back to the White House in Washington.


23
0:1:49,619 --> 0:1:54,749
That stop in Illinois was a quick one but
a historic one. The president went to Chicago


24
0:1:54,749 --> 0:2:0,79
to cast his ballot early. It`s the first time
that a U.S. president has used early voting.


25
0:2:0,79 --> 0:2:4,479
You might have noticed the candidates are
visiting a lot of the same states. Those are


26
0:2:4,479 --> 0:2:9,729
what`s known as battleground states or swing
states. Political experts say it`s not certain


27
0:2:9,729 --> 0:2:14,53
which candidate will win those states on election
day, which is why the candidates are likely


28
0:2:14,53 --> 0:2:18,23
to spend a lot of time campaigning there.


29
0:2:18,23 --> 0:2:22,4
Next up today, we have an update for you on
Malala Yousafzai. The teenager was shot by


30
0:2:22,4 --> 0:2:27,95
the Taliban for demanding education rights
for girls in her home country of Pakistan.


31
0:2:27,95 --> 0:2:32,15
Malala was moved to the United Kingdom for
medical treatment. She has a long recovery


32
0:2:32,15 --> 0:2:36,89
ahead of her, but doctors say she is making
progress. She`s in stable condition, and can


33
0:2:36,89 --> 0:2:41,54
communicate with hospital staff by writing
notes. Malala hasn`t been with her parents


34
0:2:41,54 --> 0:2:47,0
since she was moved to the U.K. That changed
yesterday. Her mom and dad, he`s the one speaking


35
0:2:47,0 --> 0:2:51,5
here, they flew to the United Kingdom from
Pakistan to be with their daughter. Pakistani


36
0:2:51,5 --> 0:2:57,3
police have identified this man, Atta Ulla
Khan (ph), as the main suspect in Malala`s


37
0:2:57,3 --> 0:3:2,34
shooting. Yesterday, he was still out there.
Six other men had been arrested in connection


38
0:3:2,34 --> 0:3:4,81
with the attack, though.


39
0:3:4,81 --> 0:3:12,26
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: See if you can ID me. I`m
a U.S. national monument that`s more than


40
0:3:12,26 --> 0:3:19,45
300 feet tall and weighs more than 150 tons.
I was a gift from France. In one hand, I`m


41
0:3:19,45 --> 0:3:24,21
holding a tablet, and in the other, I`m holding
a torch.


42
0:3:24,21 --> 0:3:30,7
I`m the Statue of Liberty, and Sunday is my
126th birthday.


43
0:3:30,7 --> 0:3:40,29
AZUZ: The day after its 125th birthday, the
statue was closed for repairs, set to open


44
0:3:40,29 --> 0:3:46,17
back up on Sunday. Zoraida Sambolin joined
a few wounded warriors, U.S. military veterans


45
0:3:46,17 --> 0:3:51,24
who were injured in combat, for a sneak preview
of some of the monument`s upgrades.


46
0:3:51,24 --> 0:3:53,2
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


47
0:3:53,2 --> 0:3:58,93
ZORAIDA SAMBOLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The Statute
of Liberty`s crown and interior have been


48
0:3:58,93 --> 0:4:4,98
closed for a year, but for retired Marine
Corps Larry Hughes, it`s seemingly been longer.


49
0:4:4,98 --> 0:4:10,59
That`s because the observation level of this
iconic symbol of freedom was not wheelchair


50
0:4:10,59 --> 0:4:12,8
accessible until today.


51
0:4:12,8 --> 0:4:15,48
LARRY HUGHES, VETERAN: Amazing.


52
0:4:15,48 --> 0:4:21,66
SAMBOLIN: Hughes, a Vietnam vet, is taking
the inaugural ride in a newly installed elevator


53
0:4:21,66 --> 0:4:23,8
to the statue`s observation deck.


54
0:4:23,8 --> 0:4:30,18
HUGHES: Just to be here was something that
never really entered into my mind, because


55
0:4:30,18 --> 0:4:37,93
something I hate to be turned down, I hate
to be rejected. So I`m no longer being rejected.


56
0:4:37,93 --> 0:4:39,33
I`m being here.


57
0:4:39,33 --> 0:4:44,77
SAMBOLIN: The new elevator is just part of
a year-long, $30 million renovation that also


58
0:4:44,77 --> 0:4:50,9
includes upgrading stairwells and making safety
improvements. The end result -- a more accessible


59
0:4:50,9 --> 0:4:57,12
Lady Liberty that will allow an additional
26,000 visitors each year a chance to enjoy


60
0:4:57,12 --> 0:4:58,58
her spectacular views.


61
0:4:58,58 --> 0:5:2,509
KIRK BAUER, VIETNAM VETERAN: When these adaptions
are made, it opens up tremendous opportunities


62
0:5:2,509 --> 0:5:3,449
for all of us.


63
0:5:3,449 --> 0:5:9,499
SAMBOLIN: Among the first to see the new renovations,
two generations of severely wounded warriors.


64
0:5:9,499 --> 0:5:16,77
I joined Kirk Bauer, who lost his leg in Vietnam,
and Jesse Acosta, who suffered injuries to


65
0:5:16,77 --> 0:5:23,33
his hip from a roadside bomb in Iraq, on the
146-step climb to the top.


66
0:5:23,33 --> 0:5:26,33
So you stuck your head out of?


67
0:5:26,33 --> 0:5:27,319
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The crown.


68
0:5:27,319 --> 0:5:31,389
SAMBOLIN: The crown. What do you think, is
this what you expected?


69
0:5:31,389 --> 0:5:35,139
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fantastic. Actually, it`s
more tight than I thought looking up, but


70
0:5:35,139 --> 0:5:37,389
it is just an incredible view.


71
0:5:37,389 --> 0:5:41,819
SAMBOLIN: The renovation was full of challenges.
Because of the statue`s location and because


72
0:5:41,819 --> 0:5:46,849
they had to do it all without drilling into
any part of the historic structure.


73
0:5:46,849 --> 0:5:47,789
(END VIDEOTAPE)


74
0:5:47,789 --> 0:5:52,65
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today`s Shoutout goes out
to Mr. Martin`s (ph) American government classes


75
0:5:52,65 --> 0:5:58,409
at Minden high school in Minden, Nebraska.
What is the name of the computer coding system


76
0:5:58,409 --> 0:6:7,18
that uses zeros and ones? Here we go. Is it
binary, HTML, Linux or Metacarpal? You`ve


77
0:6:7,18 --> 0:6:13,659
got 3 seconds, go.


78
0:6:13,659 --> 0:6:22,11
Binary means made of two parts, and binary
code is made up of two things, zeros and ones.


79
0:6:22,11 --> 0:6:24,889
That`s your answer and that`s your shoutout.


80
0:6:24,889 --> 0:6:32,909
AZUZ: If you translate the word "hi" to Spanish,
it`s ola. To German, it`s hallo. To binary,


81
0:6:32,909 --> 0:6:42,52
it`s 0110100011101001. I had to practice that.
Seems kind of complicated, but it also could


82
0:6:42,52 --> 0:6:47,3
be more lucrative. It could pay you more down
the road. Laurie Segall looks at the coding


83
0:6:47,3 --> 0:6:48,9
in the classroom.


84
0:6:48,9 --> 0:6:48,699
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


85
0:6:48,699 --> 0:6:53,61
NAQUAL ROBINSON, HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT: Another
I and an equal sign and an I plus one.


86
0:6:53,61 --> 0:6:57,629
LAURIE SEGALL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It sounds
like gibberish. You like this better than


87
0:6:57,629 --> 0:6:58,39
Italian?


88
0:6:58,39 --> 0:6:59,279
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.


89
0:6:59,279 --> 0:7:4,319
SEGALL: Better than French? It`s computer
code, and it may be more valuable than any


90
0:7:4,319 --> 0:7:6,319
other language high school students study.


91
0:7:6,319 --> 0:7:8,419
HENRY FERSKO, HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT: That`s
where you have the most jobs right now, I


92
0:7:8,419 --> 0:7:10,389
would say, in technology and stuff.


93
0:7:10,389 --> 0:7:15,669
SEGALL: Becoming a lawyer or a doctor is now
passe. With unemployment for 20- to 24-year-olds


94
0:7:15,669 --> 0:7:19,39
at 12.4 percent, the hot job now? Tech entrepreneur.


95
0:7:19,39 --> 0:7:20,979
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So how do you call the
function?


96
0:7:20,979 --> 0:7:25,199
SEGALL: But to join the club, you`ve got to
speak the language not many are fluent in


97
0:7:25,199 --> 0:7:25,569
-- programming.


98
0:7:25,569 --> 0:7:30,189
Do you think this is increasingly important
for college students and for the job market


99
0:7:30,189 --> 0:7:31,849
for people to learn these kind of skills?


100
0:7:31,849 --> 0:7:34,759
KLANA LOWERY, HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT: Of course,
of course, because new technology is being


101
0:7:34,759 --> 0:7:38,77
like built every day. You`ve got iPhones,
you got all that type of stuff. So it`s like,


102
0:7:38,77 --> 0:7:42,12
you can use this stuff to actually help you
understand it.


103
0:7:42,12 --> 0:7:46,469
SEGALL: Salaries for people with coding skills
are high. Entry-level software engineers at


104
0:7:46,469 --> 0:7:49,8
companies like Google and Facebook pay in
the six figures.


105
0:7:49,8 --> 0:7:55,389
Now, over a 40-year career, the engineering
major can make over $1 million more than the


106
0:7:55,389 --> 0:7:59,9
average college grad, so it`s definitely a
job that pays, and one where these tech skills


107
0:7:59,9 --> 0:8:4,729
are necessary. But the problem is, computer
science software engineering firms can`t find


108
0:8:4,729 --> 0:8:9,659
enough skilled workers. Enter Codecademie,
an online company that teaches the average


109
0:8:9,659 --> 0:8:14,9
Joe the most basic programming skills. Now
they created a curriculum specifically for


110
0:8:14,9 --> 0:8:15,8
schools.


111
0:8:15,8 --> 0:8:17,439
ZACH SIMS, FOUNDER, CODECADEMY: There`s not
enough teacher training for teachers who are


112
0:8:17,439 --> 0:8:20,689
interested in learning to become computer
science and programming teachers, either.


113
0:8:20,689 --> 0:8:24,729
SEGALL: Teacher Courtney Ginsberg decided
to learn coding at the Codecademie web site.


114
0:8:24,729 --> 0:8:27,559
Now she`s using it to help her students get
prepped for the job market.


115
0:8:27,559 --> 0:8:31,96
COURTNEY GINSBERG, TEACHER: It`s getting harder
and harder for my students to get even the


116
0:8:31,96 --> 0:8:35,409
after-school jobs they got a few years ago
when I started teaching.


117
0:8:35,409 --> 0:8:39,75
SEGALL: Codecademie says it`s in nearly 2,000
schools now, another step towards building


118
0:8:39,75 --> 0:8:44,32
the strength of America`s tech labor force.
And for kids today who have an iPhone in hand


119
0:8:44,32 --> 0:8:48,49
and spend a lot of time on apps, the idea
of building one for a living does not sound


120
0:8:48,49 --> 0:8:51,85
bad. They grew up on Facebook and paid attention
to the story.


121
0:8:51,85 --> 0:8:54,66
RANDI ZUCKERBERG, FOUNDER AND CEO, ZUCKERBERG
MEDIA: I think we`ve just seen so many really


122
0:8:54,66 --> 0:9:0,279
cool success stories of young people who,
you know, came to Silicon Valley with a dream


123
0:9:0,279 --> 0:9:4,66
and hit it really big. I think we`re also
in a very interesting economic time in this


124
0:9:4,66 --> 0:9:8,649
country, and people are more open to taking
risks and trying something new.


125
0:9:8,649 --> 0:9:12,22
SEGALL: Do you think you have the next Mark
Zuckerberg in your class?


126
0:9:12,22 --> 0:9:14,62
GINSBERG: That would be amazing.


127
0:9:14,62 --> 0:9:17,4

(END VIDEOTAPE)


129
0:9:18,19 --> 0:9:22,509
AZUZ: High school kicker Anthony Storego (ph)
hasn`t missed a field goal this year, and


130
0:9:22,509 --> 0:9:27,89
he didn`t miss this one, either. The difference?
The kick in this Youtube video was a game


131
0:9:27,89 --> 0:9:32,38
winner that happened with just 21 seconds
left on the clock. That`s a tough situation,


132
0:9:32,38 --> 0:9:37,38
but Anthony is used to overcoming adversity.
He lived in nearly a dozen foster homes growing


133
0:9:37,38 --> 0:9:42,25
up, and Anthony suffers from autism. But on
the football field, he`s just another one


134
0:9:42,25 --> 0:9:45,74
of the guys. Well, except for when he hit
that game winner last Friday. Then, as his


135
0:9:45,74 --> 0:9:50,38
quarterback put it, Anthony was the man. And
if he keeps up his streak of perfection, he`ll


136
0:9:50,38 --> 0:9:54,88
definitely give his team a leg up on the competition.
We`re running out of football puns. Sooner


137
0:9:54,88 --> 0:9:57,48
or later, we`re just going to have to punt,
but there`s no time left on the clock for


138
0:9:57,48 --> 0:11:57,48
us, so have a great weekend. See you later.
