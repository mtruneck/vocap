1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:13,9



2
0:0:13,9 --> 0:0:15,35
IVAR BERGLIN: So if the Poles
didn't fight the Russians in


3
0:0:15,35 --> 0:0:17,66
the first Vodka War, I
was going to do some


4
0:0:17,66 --> 0:0:19,48
fighting for them--


5
0:0:19,48 --> 0:0:21,1
sort of.


6
0:0:21,1 --> 0:0:23,69
I went to Warsaw to find out
if "vodka" was originally a


7
0:0:23,69 --> 0:0:25,851
Polish word.


8
0:0:25,851 --> 0:0:27,2
What's the oldest one
we have here?


9
0:0:27,2 --> 0:0:30,92



10
0:0:30,92 --> 0:0:31,56
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].


11
0:0:31,56 --> 0:0:33,5
IVAR BERGLIN: 1809.


12
0:0:33,5 --> 0:0:35,24
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, this one.


13
0:0:35,24 --> 0:0:37,76



14
0:0:37,76 --> 0:0:38,53
[INAUDIBLE].


15
0:0:38,53 --> 0:0:39,7
IVAR BERGLIN: This is
the oldest one.


16
0:0:39,7 --> 0:0:40,23
Whoa.


17
0:0:40,23 --> 0:0:41,45
OK.


18
0:0:41,45 --> 0:0:42,756
FEMALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING POLISH]


19
0:0:42,756 --> 0:0:44,61
IVAR BERGLIN: Careful.


20
0:0:44,61 --> 0:0:48,21
So can you tell me
what this says?


21
0:0:48,21 --> 0:0:49,46
FEMALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING POLISH]


22
0:0:49,46 --> 0:1:9,13



23
0:1:9,13 --> 0:1:10,13
IVAR BERGLIN: So where
did you find it?


24
0:1:10,13 --> 0:1:10,54
Here?


25
0:1:10,54 --> 0:1:11,22
FEMALE SPEAKER: Mmhm.


26
0:1:11,22 --> 0:1:13,85
IVAR BERGLIN: I don't see
"vodka" anywhere here.


27
0:1:13,85 --> 0:1:16,182
What's the Polish
word for vodka?


28
0:1:16,182 --> 0:1:17,43
FEMALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING POLISH]


29
0:1:17,43 --> 0:1:20,356
IVAR BERGLIN: "Wodka." But where
do you find that here?


30
0:1:20,356 --> 0:1:21,606
FEMALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING POLISH]


31
0:1:21,606 --> 0:1:34,0



32
0:1:34,0 --> 0:1:35,1
IVAR BERGLIN: Gorzalka.


33
0:1:35,1 --> 0:1:37,5
FEMALE SPEAKER: Gorzalka.


34
0:1:37,5 --> 0:1:38,3
[SPEAKING POLISH]


35
0:1:38,3 --> 0:1:41,39



36
0:1:41,39 --> 0:1:43,94
IVAR BERGLIN: So I wasn't really
looking for "vodka." I


37
0:1:43,94 --> 0:1:50,0
was looking for the original old
Polish word, "gorzalka."


38
0:1:50,0 --> 0:1:52,5
So I went to Krakow.


39
0:1:52,5 --> 0:1:55,952
It's in Krakow that you find
some really old books.


40
0:1:55,952 --> 0:1:56,794
IVAR BERGLIN: Hi, Ivar.


41
0:1:56,794 --> 0:1:57,97
ANNA OLSZEWSKA: Hello, Anna.


42
0:1:57,97 --> 0:1:58,85
IVAR BERGLIN: Hi, nice
to meet you.


43
0:1:58,85 --> 0:1:59,85
ANNA OLSZEWSKA: Nice to
to meet you, Ivar.


44
0:1:59,85 --> 0:2:1,22
IVAR BERGLIN: You're gonna
show me some books?


45
0:2:1,22 --> 0:2:3,6
ANNA OLSZEWSKA: Yeah, we're
gonna see some old


46
0:2:3,6 --> 0:2:4,91
print now, I hope.


47
0:2:4,91 --> 0:2:9,1
We're gonna see prints dated
to 16th century that would


48
0:2:9,1 --> 0:2:14,7
cast a light on the context
of the words "vodka" and


49
0:2:14,7 --> 0:2:16,41
"gorzalka" and how these
words were used in


50
0:2:16,41 --> 0:2:17,67
early Polish language.


51
0:2:17,67 --> 0:2:22,67



52
0:2:22,67 --> 0:2:23,92
[INAUDIBLE].


53
0:2:23,92 --> 0:2:28,63



54
0:2:28,63 --> 0:2:30,59
OK.


55
0:2:30,59 --> 0:2:32,6
IVAR BERGLIN: Oh, I can't
touch these, right?


56
0:2:32,6 --> 0:2:32,77
ANNA OLSZEWSKA: No,
you cannot.


57
0:2:32,77 --> 0:2:33,42
IVAR BERGLIN: OK.


58
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:34,21
ANNA OLSZEWSKA: Otherwise,
you will be


59
0:2:34,21 --> 0:2:36,48
poisoned and cursed forever.


60
0:2:36,48 --> 0:2:37,11
IVAR BERGLIN: Wait a minute.


61
0:2:37,11 --> 0:2:39,38
Did she just put
a spell on me?


62
0:2:39,38 --> 0:2:44,49
ANNA OLSZEWSKA: This book was
printed in Krakow in 1543.


63
0:2:44,49 --> 0:2:47,35
This is Falimierz on herbs.


64
0:2:47,35 --> 0:2:55,27
We have special two chapters
that concentrate on burning


65
0:2:55,27 --> 0:2:59,59
waters, as I can literally
translate it, which means


66
0:2:59,59 --> 0:3:4,2
"gorzalka." "Gorzalka" can mean
something that is bitter


67
0:3:4,2 --> 0:3:8,47
in taste and something
that is spicy.


68
0:3:8,47 --> 0:3:11,12
And it is of medical use.


69
0:3:11,12 --> 0:3:13,52
The use is testified
here, because it


70
0:3:13,52 --> 0:3:15,51
is a medical manual.


71
0:3:15,51 --> 0:3:18,89
IVAR BERGLIN: So it's in "The
Herbal," in the year 1543,


72
0:3:18,89 --> 0:3:22,2
that we find the first mention
of the word "vodla." Scott


73
0:3:22,2 --> 0:3:25,64
Simpson is an expert of the
origins of Polish vodka, and a


74
0:3:25,64 --> 0:3:27,27
snappy dresser to boot.


75
0:3:27,27 --> 0:3:28,92
He took us further
down the road.


76
0:3:28,92 --> 0:3:30,4
SCOTT SIMPSON: This is
Florianska Street.


77
0:3:30,4 --> 0:3:33,9
It runs out to St. Florian's
Church further out that way to


78
0:3:33,9 --> 0:3:35,58
the north of the old town.


79
0:3:35,58 --> 0:3:39,1
And then you've got St.
Florian's gate right there.


80
0:3:39,1 --> 0:3:40,37
That's the gate leading out.


81
0:3:40,37 --> 0:3:42,59
It's got a picture of
Saint Florian on it.


82
0:3:42,59 --> 0:3:47,96
He's pouring out a great big
mug of beer in order to--


83
0:3:47,96 --> 0:3:49,665
IVAR BERGLIN: Who's
Saint Florian?


84
0:3:49,665 --> 0:3:51,88
SCOTT SIMPSON: He's the patron
saint of firefighters.


85
0:3:51,88 --> 0:3:55,5
He's pouring out the great big
bucket of beer in order to put


86
0:3:55,5 --> 0:3:56,345
out a fire.


87
0:3:56,345 --> 0:3:58,25
IVAR BERGLIN: And here, we have
a traditional Polish--


88
0:3:58,25 --> 0:4:0,65



89
0:4:0,65 --> 0:4:3,83
SCOTT SIMPSON: Walking
beer, yes.


90
0:4:3,83 --> 0:4:7,38
In Polish, this is a piwnice,
which means,


91
0:4:7,38 --> 0:4:9,38
literally, a beer cellar.


92
0:4:9,38 --> 0:4:12,7
It's a place where
you keep beer.


93
0:4:12,7 --> 0:4:12,4
IVAR BERGLIN: Wow.


94
0:4:12,4 --> 0:4:14,2
SCOTT SIMPSON: OK, now, here we
have things that are little


95
0:4:14,2 --> 0:4:17,19
more directly related to
the question of vodka.


96
0:4:17,19 --> 0:4:18,779
In the Middle Ages,
you wouldn't want


97
0:4:18,779 --> 0:4:19,64
to drink the water.


98
0:4:19,64 --> 0:4:22,39
So most people were drinking
something on the order of beer


99
0:4:22,39 --> 0:4:26,36
or wine all day, all day
long, in small amounts.


100
0:4:26,36 --> 0:4:30,8
So they had a real reason to
keep the alcohol content down.


101
0:4:30,8 --> 0:4:32,87
Often, if they were drinking
an 8% wine, they might even


102
0:4:32,87 --> 0:4:35,76
add water to it to bring it
down to about 4% so they


103
0:4:35,76 --> 0:4:38,18
wouldn't be drunk from
drinking it all day.


104
0:4:38,18 --> 0:4:43,77
To make a jump from 4%
to 50% is a big jump.


105
0:4:43,77 --> 0:4:44,13
IVAR BERGLIN: That's big.


106
0:4:44,13 --> 0:4:46,81
SCOTT SIMPSON: And normal
people, biologically, aren't


107
0:4:46,81 --> 0:4:48,54
going to like that jump.


108
0:4:48,54 --> 0:4:50,0
IVAR BERGLIN: Someone
wanted to get drunk.


109
0:4:50,0 --> 0:4:51,8
SCOTT SIMPSON: Somebody has
to convince him to do it.


110
0:4:51,8 --> 0:4:54,86
And one theory about how it
worked is that we saw the


111
0:4:54,86 --> 0:4:57,8
medical manual.


112
0:4:57,8 --> 0:4:59,56
We're looking at the period of
time in which the Black Death


113
0:4:59,56 --> 0:5:0,79
is going through Europe.


114
0:5:0,79 --> 0:5:3,52
Vodka is being prescribed for
practically every problem you


115
0:5:3,52 --> 0:5:4,8
could possibly have.


116
0:5:4,8 --> 0:5:7,94
People start out drinking their
prescribed vodka the


117
0:5:7,94 --> 0:5:11,33
doctor gave them, saying, oh
Lord, this tastes awful and


118
0:5:11,33 --> 0:5:12,67
drinking it down.


119
0:5:12,67 --> 0:5:16,0
And then later on, as they're
doing it more and more


120
0:5:16,0 --> 0:5:18,31
throughout that century, they're
beginning to like it


121
0:5:18,31 --> 0:5:19,54
more and more.


122
0:5:19,54 --> 0:5:21,53
And then they finally decide,
well, I'd like to drink it


123
0:5:21,53 --> 0:5:22,96
because it tastes good.


124
0:5:22,96 --> 0:5:25,87
Lots of countries in this area
produce things that are other


125
0:5:25,87 --> 0:5:29,12
cold vodka or called something
else, but are clearly very


126
0:5:29,12 --> 0:5:32,85
much the same product as we
modernly think of as vodka.


127
0:5:32,85 --> 0:5:35,55
So it's very difficult,
actually, to stick it to just


128
0:5:35,55 --> 0:5:38,9
one country as really being
the owner of it.


129
0:5:38,9 --> 0:5:45,12



130
0:5:45,12 --> 0:5:47,28
SCOTT SIMPSON: --appears in
writing in Poland before it


131
0:5:47,28 --> 0:5:50,6
appears in writing in Russia.


132
0:5:50,6 --> 0:5:51,86
IVAR BERGLIN: So there you go.


133
0:5:51,86 --> 0:5:54,85
If it might be impossible to
find out whether it was an old


134
0:5:54,85 --> 0:5:58,6
Russian or an old Pole that
first make vodka, the origins


135
0:5:58,6 --> 0:6:0,49
of the word are pretty clear.


136
0:6:0,49 --> 0:6:3,37
According to our Polish
historian, Scott, the word


137
0:6:3,37 --> 0:6:6,37
describing the drink appears
in Polish writing before it


138
0:6:6,37 --> 0:6:9,41
appears in Russian,
around 1543.


139
0:6:9,41 --> 0:6:11,11
It's a fact.


140
0:6:11,11 --> 0:6:14,55
Remember the magical date 1440
that Pokhlebkin wrote about?


141
0:6:14,55 --> 0:6:16,53
Where did he get that date?


142
0:6:16,53 --> 0:6:19,25
The word "vodka" wouldn't even
appear in Russian texts for at


143
0:6:19,25 --> 0:6:21,98
least another 200 years.


144
0:6:21,98 --> 0:6:25,53
So if the Polish word "wodka"
is the original word, why


145
0:6:25,53 --> 0:6:28,24
didn't they say so during
the first Vodka War?


146
0:6:28,24 --> 0:6:29,37
I mean, come on, Poland.


147
0:6:29,37 --> 0:6:30,62
What the fuck?


148
0:6:30,62 --> 0:6:33,29



149
0:6:33,29 --> 0:6:38,11
Then I realized that the "what
the fuck" was really serious.


150
0:6:38,11 --> 0:6:39,93
The Poles had their
hands full.


151
0:6:39,93 --> 0:6:46,8



152
0:6:46,8 --> 0:6:49,79
The key to Polish vodka
obscurity lies in a dark


153
0:6:49,79 --> 0:6:51,97
period of Polish history.


154
0:6:51,97 --> 0:6:55,79
Russian communist rule scarred
Poland for generations.


155
0:6:55,79 --> 0:6:58,82
You have to understand that the
first Vodka War was waged


156
0:6:58,82 --> 0:7:1,2
during a much more
epic struggle--


157
0:7:1,2 --> 0:7:3,1
the struggle against
communism.


158
0:7:3,1 --> 0:7:5,74
In the midst of a national
Solidarity movement to free


159
0:7:5,74 --> 0:7:8,89
their country from Soviet
control, maybe the Poles took


160
0:7:8,89 --> 0:7:11,21
their eye off the battle
for vodka.


161
0:7:11,21 --> 0:7:13,26
I totally get that.


162
0:7:13,26 --> 0:7:15,1
If you could tell me what
this is about--


163
0:7:15,1 --> 0:7:16,35
TADEUSZ FILIPKOWSKI:

He graciously invited us into

171

0:7:37,72 --> 0:9:25,715



174
0:9:25,715 --> 0:9:28,26
IVAR BERGLIN: If Poland lost
the first Vodka War and the


175
0:9:28,26 --> 0:9:32,33
last 50 years to communist rule,
today, it's fighting not


176
0:9:32,33 --> 0:9:35,21
to lose anymore.


177
0:9:35,21 --> 0:9:38,81
In fact, Poland is fighting
another vodka war, this time


178
0:9:38,81 --> 0:9:41,18
taking aim at the heart
of old Europe.


179
0:9:41,18 --> 0:9:43,0
This is the man who's
fighting it.


180
0:9:43,0 --> 0:9:45,52
Ryzard Czarnecki is a Polish
member of the European


181
0:9:45,52 --> 0:9:48,7
Parliament, and he has been
waging a campaign to create a


182
0:9:48,7 --> 0:9:50,62
new vodka region.


183
0:9:50,62 --> 0:9:53,62
Only countries in this region
would be allowed to call their


184
0:9:53,62 --> 0:9:55,17
spirits vodka.


185
0:9:55,17 --> 0:9:59,32
And of course, Poland would
be at its heart.


186
0:9:59,32 --> 0:10:1,48
So why should there
be a vodka region?


187
0:10:1,48 --> 0:10:55,37
RYZARD CZARNECKI:
[SPEAKING POLISH]


188
0:10:55,37 --> 0:10:58,2
IVAR BERGLIN: If there was a

189
0:10:58,2 --> 0:11:0,32
would look like.


190
0:11:0,32 --> 0:11:2,54
Welcome to the heartland
of Polish vodka.


191
0:11:2,54 --> 0:11:5,43



192
0:11:5,43 --> 0:11:8,89
We should have had a bottle
of vodka at the moment.


193
0:11:8,89 --> 0:11:9,68
I don't know where we are.


194
0:11:9,68 --> 0:11:12,21
The driver doesn't seem
to know where we are.


195
0:11:12,21 --> 0:11:16,6
We've been driving for over four
and a half hours, more--


196
0:11:16,6 --> 0:11:18,33
more, I guess.


197
0:11:18,33 --> 0:11:22,17
And I don't know what's growing
out in these fields


198
0:11:22,17 --> 0:11:24,45
we're passing, but it just
seemed too long.


199
0:11:24,45 --> 0:11:27,33
And now the driver's
fucking leave us.


200
0:11:27,33 --> 0:11:28,76
So we're lost.


201

0:11:37,7 --> 0:11:37,9
Ivar.


204
0:11:37,9 --> 0:11:39,26
GRZEGORZ KONIECZNY:
[SPEAKING POLISH]


205
0:11:39,26 --> 0:11:56,37



206
0:11:56,37 --> 0:11:59,12
IVAR BERGLIN: Why is is so
important with Polish vodka


207
0:11:59,12 --> 0:12:0,28
that it's made from rye?


208
0:12:0,28 --> 0:12:1,53
GRZEGORZ KONIECZNY:
[SPEAKING POLISH]


209
0:12:1,53 --> 0:12:11,71



210
0:12:11,71 --> 0:12:14,35
IVAR BERGLIN: So
here's the rye.


211
0:12:14,35 --> 0:12:16,21
That's where it all starts.


212
0:12:16,21 --> 0:12:19,84
And then it goes through all
the machines we're going to


213
0:12:19,84 --> 0:12:22,8
look at downstairs.


214
0:12:22,8 --> 0:12:24,52
And then [POLISH].


215
0:12:24,52 --> 0:12:25,556
GRZEGORZ KONIECZNY: [POLISH].


216
0:12:25,556 --> 0:12:26,8
IVAR BERGLIN: Yeah?


217
0:12:26,8 --> 0:12:26,45
GRZEGORZ KONIECZNY: Yes.


218
0:12:26,45 --> 0:12:28,84
IVAR BERGLIN: OK, let's
go check it out.


219
0:12:28,84 --> 0:12:30,9
GRZEGORZ KONIECZNY:
[SPEAKING POLISH]


220
0:12:30,9 --> 0:12:39,345



221
0:12:39,345 --> 0:12:40,69
IVAR BERGLIN: Can I throw
some in there?


222
0:12:40,69 --> 0:12:44,16



223
0:12:44,16 --> 0:12:45,426
Make some vodka.


224
0:12:45,426 --> 0:12:46,676
GRZEGORZ KONIECZNY:
[SPEAKING POLISH]


225
0:12:46,676 --> 0:13:9,94



226
0:13:9,94 --> 0:13:12,46
IVAR BERGLIN: Whoa,
that's strong.


227
0:13:12,46 --> 0:13:14,8
I'd like to hear your opinion
on the difference between


228
0:13:14,8 --> 0:13:18,732
Polish wodka and
Russian vodka.


229
0:13:18,732 --> 0:13:19,982
GRZEGORZ KONIECZNY:
[SPEAKING POLISH]


230
0:13:19,982 --> 0:13:31,21



231
0:13:31,21 --> 0:13:34,8
IVAR BERGLIN: Was it Poland or
Russia that invented vodka?


232
0:13:34,8 --> 0:13:36,5
GRZEGORZ KONIECZNY:
[SPEAKING POLISH]


233
0:13:36,5 --> 0:13:42,66



234
0:13:42,66 --> 0:13:45,28
IVAR BERGLIN: So where are we
today with your efforts of


235
0:13:45,28 --> 0:13:47,8
creating a vodka region?


236
0:13:47,8 --> 0:13:48,33
RYZARD CZARNECKI:
[SPEAKING POLISH]


237
0:13:48,33 --> 0:14:28,91



238
0:14:28,91 --> 0:14:31,48
IVAR BERGLIN: So Poland lost the
second Vodka War, but as


239
0:14:31,48 --> 0:14:35,79
Czarnecki says, it didn't
really lose at all.


240
0:14:35,79 --> 0:14:38,69
And to understand why, you have
to know something about


241
0:14:38,69 --> 0:14:39,94
Poland today.


242
0:14:39,94 --> 0:14:42,28



243
0:14:42,28 --> 0:14:46,6
On my last day, I hung out with
some of my new friends.


244
0:14:46,6 --> 0:14:49,83
I hung out with Marisha, a
Polish university student who


245
0:14:49,83 --> 0:14:52,18
told me all about
Polish pride.


246
0:14:52,18 --> 0:14:54,704
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's very
complicated matter, Polish


247
0:14:54,704 --> 0:14:59,8
pride, because first of all,
Polish people are very proud


248
0:14:59,8 --> 0:15:2,315
of their heritage and culture
and tradition.


249
0:15:2,315 --> 0:15:4,265
This country has a lot
to give by itself.


250
0:15:4,265 --> 0:15:8,31
And we should invent our own
style and do our thing, since


251
0:15:8,31 --> 0:15:11,752
we have a lot to give.


252
0:15:11,752 --> 0:15:13,71
IVAR BERGLIN: I hung out with
our production assistant,


253
0:15:13,71 --> 0:15:17,99
[INAUDIBLE], comparing
old Warsaw to new.


254
0:15:17,99 --> 0:15:21,58
And I hung out with Mikolai, a
photographer, editor, and all


255
0:15:21,58 --> 0:15:23,83
around Warsaw fun guy.


256
0:15:23,83 --> 0:15:27,24
He's got tons of energy and a
million things on the go at


257
0:15:27,24 --> 0:15:28,6
any one time.


258
0:15:28,6 --> 0:15:30,14
MALE SPEAKER: I'm making photos
all the time, doing the


259
0:15:30,14 --> 0:15:33,53
parties, exhibitions, concerts,
private parties--


260
0:15:33,53 --> 0:15:35,52
everywhere.


261
0:15:35,52 --> 0:15:37,55
IVAR BERGLIN: It was through my
new Polish friends that I


262
0:15:37,55 --> 0:15:40,66
learned that a Vodka War is
about much more than a fight


263
0:15:40,66 --> 0:15:43,35
for the origin of a drink.


264
0:15:43,35 --> 0:15:46,63
It's about creating a new
identity, about creating a new


265
0:15:46,63 --> 0:15:50,35
Poland that is a real player
on the world stage, or at


266
0:15:50,35 --> 0:15:53,63
least a player on the shelf
for your favorite bar.


267
0:15:53,63 --> 0:15:55,47
Though it's not so much
about winning--


268
0:15:55,47 --> 0:15:58,594
it's really about being in
the game to begin with.


269
0:15:58,594 --> 0:15:59,56
IVAR BERGLIN: [INAUDIBLE].


270
0:15:59,56 --> 0:16:1,33
Want a drink?


271
0:16:1,33 --> 0:16:2,26
Can we drink?


272
0:16:2,26 --> 0:16:2,54
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.


273
0:16:2,54 --> 0:16:3,79
IVAR BERGLIN: What kind
of question is that?


274
0:16:3,79 --> 0:16:6,5



275
0:16:6,5 --> 0:16:9,81
On that last night, Eddy and I
ended up in a corner of Warsaw


276
0:16:9,81 --> 0:16:13,22
at 5:00 AM drinking and eating
kielbasa, wishing the


277
0:16:13,22 --> 0:16:15,3
adventure would never end.


278
0:16:15,3 --> 0:16:18,39
We chased the origins of vodka--
in books, in bars, to


279
0:16:18,39 --> 0:16:20,12
the end of the bloody rainbow.


280
0:16:20,12 --> 0:16:22,75
We were lost, found,
lost again.


281
0:16:22,75 --> 0:16:24,29
This is stupid.


282
0:16:24,29 --> 0:16:27,31
Crossed time zones, countries,
bridged histories--


283
0:16:27,31 --> 0:16:29,2
and what did we find?


284
0:16:29,2 --> 0:16:31,15
The Vodka Wars instead.


285
0:16:31,15 --> 0:16:34,9
We found the troubled history
of the 20th century and two


286
0:16:34,9 --> 0:16:38,31
nations being reborn right
before our eyes.


287
0:16:38,31 --> 0:16:42,86
Surely, the world doesn't
need another Vodka War.


288
0:16:42,86 --> 0:16:45,7
We just need more vodka.


289
0:16:45,7 --> 0:16:46,95
[POLISH].


290
0:16:46,95 --> 0:18:46,95
