1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,23



2
0:0:10,23 --> 0:0:12,4
-Every year at this time,
everyone on the eastern


3
0:0:12,4 --> 0:0:14,99
seaboard who knows anything
about snowboarding shows up


4
0:0:14,99 --> 0:0:16,48
for the US Open halfpipe.


5
0:0:16,48 --> 0:0:19,59
We're expecting crowds of up to
10,000 people here today.


6
0:0:19,59 --> 0:0:22,36
This thing goes off, it's the
biggest snowboard competition


7
0:0:22,36 --> 0:0:23,14
in the world.


8
0:0:23,14 --> 0:0:26,47
SHEM ROOSE: The Opens through
the '90s were definitely--


9
0:0:26,47 --> 0:0:28,1
they could get out of control.


10
0:0:28,1 --> 0:0:31,43
JEFF BRUSHIE: People had kegs
going on the side of the pipe,


11
0:0:31,43 --> 0:0:34,28
people lined up, drinking
and screaming.


12
0:0:34,28 --> 0:0:36,87
SHEM ROOSE: I think one of the
top highlights from any of the


13
0:0:36,87 --> 0:0:37,82
Opens was the cage.


14
0:0:37,82 --> 0:0:39,7
Everyone talks about the cage.


15
0:0:39,7 --> 0:0:42,46
JEFF BRUSHIE: Some years, people
would bring fencing and


16
0:0:42,46 --> 0:0:46,17
make their own little beer
cage that only their crew


17
0:0:46,17 --> 0:0:46,875
could be in.


18
0:0:46,875 --> 0:0:48,25
It was crazy.


19
0:0:48,25 --> 0:0:50,91
TRICIA BYRNES: Pat Bridges, Mark
Sullivan, all those guys,


20
0:0:50,91 --> 0:0:54,81
they built this like sketchy
chicken wire cage with like


21
0:0:54,81 --> 0:0:58,19
two by fours that was not
up to code for sure.


22
0:0:58,19 --> 0:1:2,31
And they pretty much just got
wasted all day and cheered on


23
0:1:2,31 --> 0:1:3,8
snowboarding.


24
0:1:3,8 --> 0:1:4,472
It was sick.


25
0:1:4,472 --> 0:1:6,24
PAT BRIDGES: So we get up
at 5:00 in the morning.


26
0:1:6,24 --> 0:1:9,49
We go up to the bottom of the
pipe and we start dragging


27
0:1:9,49 --> 0:1:11,98
these two by fours and all this
chicken wire up there.


28
0:1:11,98 --> 0:1:14,21
Then this guy comes up
on a snowmobile--


29
0:1:14,21 --> 0:1:16,45
and this is where I think it's
all going to come to an end,


30
0:1:16,45 --> 0:1:18,58
and this guy's like, hey,
what are you guys doing?


31
0:1:18,58 --> 0:1:21,78
We're like, oh, we're creating
a private viewing area for


32
0:1:21,78 --> 0:1:22,475
Burton employees.


33
0:1:22,475 --> 0:1:24,475
And the guy's like, oh really?


34
0:1:24,475 --> 0:1:25,2
Can I get you anything?


35
0:1:25,2 --> 0:1:26,98
You guys need some trash
barrels, some


36
0:1:26,98 --> 0:1:28,0
chairs, some tables?


37
0:1:28,0 --> 0:1:29,71
And we're like, we need
all of the above.


38
0:1:29,71 --> 0:1:32,21
TOM MONTEROSSO: And my friends
and I had absolutely no idea


39
0:1:32,21 --> 0:1:33,6
what was going on.


40
0:1:33,6 --> 0:1:34,88
We saw that there was
a bouncer letting


41
0:1:34,88 --> 0:1:35,84
people in and out.


42
0:1:35,84 --> 0:1:37,37
People were partying in it.


43
0:1:37,37 --> 0:1:39,28
And it was just all
out mayhem.


44
0:1:39,28 --> 0:1:42,48
If you walked up the left side
of the pipe during the Open,


45
0:1:42,48 --> 0:1:45,3
during the contest, you were
probably going to drink like


46
0:1:45,3 --> 0:1:47,77
one or two beers every run.


47
0:1:47,77 --> 0:1:50,15
You were going to stop, say
hello to a bunch of locals,


48
0:1:50,15 --> 0:1:52,16
friends, and everybody
was partying.


49
0:1:52,16 --> 0:1:54,34
And if you needed a break from
that, you would walk up the


50
0:1:54,34 --> 0:1:55,48
right side--


51
0:1:55,48 --> 0:1:57,44
which I never did.


52
0:1:57,44 --> 0:1:59,9
It's a serious event, but at the
same time, you're partying


53
0:1:59,9 --> 0:2:1,9
with the crowd and you're
partying with the other


54
0:2:1,9 --> 0:2:2,46
competitors.


55
0:2:2,46 --> 0:2:6,33
And yeah, left wall.


56
0:2:6,33 --> 0:2:8,96
JEFF BRUSHIE: But there would
be dudes hanging out of the


57
0:2:8,96 --> 0:2:11,3
cage going, Brushie!


58
0:2:11,3 --> 0:2:14,36
Get over here!


59
0:2:14,36 --> 0:2:16,3
Trying to drag you in.


60
0:2:16,3 --> 0:2:17,65
Have a drink.


61
0:2:17,65 --> 0:2:18,74
And you're trying
to do your runs.


62
0:2:18,74 --> 0:2:23,57
NEIL KORN: There were so many
people in there that the cage


63
0:2:23,57 --> 0:2:25,9
just broke.


64
0:2:25,9 --> 0:2:28,99
And where people were standing
on the backside


65
0:2:28,99 --> 0:2:31,215
fell off the halfpipe.


66
0:2:31,215 --> 0:2:33,36
PAT BRIDGES: I was thinking
that these 60 people on


67
0:2:33,36 --> 0:2:34,61
chicken wire were going
to fly down and


68
0:2:34,61 --> 0:2:36,58
take down 3,000 people.


69
0:2:36,58 --> 0:2:37,76
Didn't happen, thank God.


70
0:2:37,76 --> 0:2:38,75
Nobody got hurt.


71
0:2:38,75 --> 0:2:41,51
I mean, there were
some incidents.


72
0:2:41,51 --> 0:2:43,32
CRIS DABICA: Pat's one of the
greatest snowboarders in the


73
0:2:43,32 --> 0:2:47,68
world, and Pat did eggplants
and his weird handplant


74
0:2:47,68 --> 0:2:51,6
variations in that
pipe, trashed,


75
0:2:51,6 --> 0:2:53,165
wearing a tiger costume.


76
0:2:53,165 --> 0:2:55,92
And it's hard enough to walk
down the road wearing a tiger


77
0:2:55,92 --> 0:2:57,19
costume drunk.


78
0:2:57,19 --> 0:3:0,42
And he was rolling in
from the deck doing


79
0:3:0,42 --> 0:3:2,4
inverts in that costume.


80
0:3:2,4 --> 0:3:3,86
And that's just mind-boggling.


81
0:3:3,86 --> 0:3:7,6
BARRY DUGAN: Those are the
moments that you can't script.


82
0:3:7,6 --> 0:3:9,33
People going like, we're
going to the Open,


83
0:3:9,33 --> 0:3:12,4
let's fill in the blank.


84
0:3:12,4 --> 0:3:16,19
Let's throw up a cage and get
some costumes and bring in


85
0:3:16,19 --> 0:3:18,77
stacks of beer and
just go for it.


86
0:3:18,77 --> 0:3:19,37
Why not?


87
0:3:19,37 --> 0:3:22,18
TOM MONTEROSSO: And just to see
this whole thing unfold, I


88
0:3:22,18 --> 0:3:24,87
mean, I think it's a really
big part as to why I kept


89
0:3:24,87 --> 0:3:28,14
snowboarding because I just
wanted to constantly feel that


90
0:3:28,14 --> 0:3:29,29
excited about something.


91
0:3:29,29 --> 0:3:31,13
CRIS DABICA: They just went up
and acted like they owned the


92
0:3:31,13 --> 0:3:32,78
place and created this thing.


93
0:3:32,78 --> 0:3:34,46
And nobody asked them
to take it down.


94
0:3:34,46 --> 0:3:37,345
That, I think, was one of the
higher points of participation


95
0:3:37,345 --> 0:3:39,5
from the crowd standpoint.


96
0:3:39,5 --> 0:3:42,99
It was symbolic of the freedom
that you had as a


97
0:3:42,99 --> 0:3:44,7
spectator at the event.


98
0:3:44,7 --> 0:3:46,86
The Open doesn't belong
to the sponsors,


99
0:3:46,86 --> 0:3:48,24
doesn't belong to Stratton.


100
0:3:48,24 --> 0:3:50,6
It belongs to the people that
have come year after year


101
0:3:50,6 --> 0:3:55,24
after year, those 5,000 people
that came between the second


102
0:3:55,24 --> 0:3:57,952
they started doing pipe
and the end of


103
0:3:57,952 --> 0:4:0,68
that next decade basically.


104
0:4:0,68 --> 0:4:1,43
TERJE HAAKONSEN: Yeah.


105
0:4:1,43 --> 0:4:2,53
It was hilarious.


106
0:4:2,53 --> 0:4:6,43
People climbing up in trees,
snowball fights, a lot of


107
0:4:6,43 --> 0:4:8,545
drinking on the side.


108
0:4:8,545 --> 0:4:10,795
A lot of cheering, a lot
of shit-talking.


109
0:4:10,795 --> 0:4:11,99
JEFF BRUSHIE: It was sick.


110
0:4:11,99 --> 0:4:15,52
It was like you wanted to ride
to please the crowd there.


111
0:4:15,52 --> 0:4:19,19
You wanted to be up over the
crowd looking down and people


112
0:4:19,19 --> 0:4:21,31
going yeah.


113
0:4:21,31 --> 0:4:23,56
ANDY COHGLAN: I think that
really ups the level of every


114
0:4:23,56 --> 0:4:24,8
competitor.


115
0:4:24,8 --> 0:4:29,93
And that's kind of the legacy of
the US Open started by Jeff


116
0:4:29,93 --> 0:4:33,68
Brushie back in the day,
I think, in 1990.


117
0:4:33,68 --> 0:4:37,51
He came onto the scene and just
started doing big airs.


118
0:4:37,51 --> 0:4:40,91
DANNY KASS: Brushie was just
throwing out the illest crails


119
0:4:40,91 --> 0:4:43,48
and just like boning it out.


120
0:4:43,48 --> 0:4:48,35
And it was just like that vibe
of this is snowboarding.


121
0:4:48,35 --> 0:4:49,21
There's no rules.


122
0:4:49,21 --> 0:4:53,46
TERJE HAAKONSEN: I rode with
Brushie a lot and also he went


123
0:4:53,46 --> 0:4:55,74
the biggest at the time.


124
0:4:55,74 --> 0:4:59,11
I was really influenced
by Craig so I was


125
0:4:59,11 --> 0:5:0,23
just going to like--


126
0:5:0,23 --> 0:5:2,84
my philosophy, if I can be as
technical as Craig at the time


127
0:5:2,84 --> 0:5:4,84
and go as big as Brush
and Palmer, I


128
0:5:4,84 --> 0:5:5,995
would do pretty good.


129
0:5:5,995 --> 0:5:8,24
ANDY COHGLAN: We didn't
see Terje at


130
0:5:8,24 --> 0:5:10,37
the Open as a superstar.


131
0:5:10,37 --> 0:5:12,71
When he came, he was definitely
one of the up and


132
0:5:12,71 --> 0:5:14,9
coming groms.


133
0:5:14,9 --> 0:5:17,85
But he didn't roll
right in and win.


134
0:5:17,85 --> 0:5:20,41
Took a few years.


135
0:5:20,41 --> 0:5:22,33
-Was there a little bit of
a grudge match going on?


136
0:5:22,33 --> 0:5:24,815
You came in second to Terje
Haakonsen at the World's at


137
0:5:24,815 --> 0:5:27,7
South Lake Tahoe and today,
you squeezed him


138
0:5:27,7 --> 0:5:28,59
by 3/10 of a point.


139
0:5:28,59 --> 0:5:30,78
TODD RICHARDS: The only grudge
match between Haakon is


140
0:5:30,78 --> 0:5:32,85
because the blasted me in the
face with champagne at the


141
0:5:32,85 --> 0:5:34,45
World's, then he ran
away from me and I


142
0:5:34,45 --> 0:5:35,74
couldn't get him back.


143
0:5:35,74 --> 0:5:36,92
No, there's no grudge
match there.


144
0:5:36,92 --> 0:5:37,77
The only thing that--


145
0:5:37,77 --> 0:5:40,68
that kid just pushes me,
pushes me super hard.


146
0:5:40,68 --> 0:5:44,47
His last run was probably one of
the most diverse runs I've


147
0:5:44,47 --> 0:5:49,502
seen him do in a long time,
and it's rad to see that.


148
0:5:49,502 --> 0:5:51,5
TERJE HAAKONSEN: All the guys
I looked up to, they were


149
0:5:51,5 --> 0:5:52,28
really cool to me.


150
0:5:52,28 --> 0:5:54,94
But I know there was a lot of
hate from all other guys and I


151
0:5:54,94 --> 0:5:56,19
could totally feel it.


152
0:5:56,19 --> 0:5:59,16



153
0:5:59,16 --> 0:6:0,355
Jimi Scott was pretty
good example.


154
0:6:0,355 --> 0:6:3,76
He was really trying to psych
out every newb that came out.


155
0:6:3,76 --> 0:6:6,38
Not only me, but
everybody else.


156
0:6:6,38 --> 0:6:10,45
But then you have Palmer and
Brushie kind of like helping


157
0:6:10,45 --> 0:6:13,59
you to gain some psychological
power against him.


158
0:6:13,59 --> 0:6:17,74
Like Palmer always told me when
Jimi drops, you just drop


159
0:6:17,74 --> 0:6:20,63
right after him and go
twice as big as him.


160
0:6:20,63 --> 0:6:23,34
He always used to tell me that
and Jimi would drop in, and


161
0:6:23,34 --> 0:6:25,1
Palmer would drop,
and I would drop.


162
0:6:25,1 --> 0:6:30,6
JAKE BURTON: I think that
probably my best Terje moment


163
0:6:30,6 --> 0:6:32,26
at the Open was when I first saw
this sticker, the bootleg


164
0:6:32,26 --> 0:6:34,5
sticker that said I saw
Terje go fucking


165
0:6:34,5 --> 0:6:36,84
huge at the US Open.


166
0:6:36,84 --> 0:6:37,49
It was great.


167
0:6:37,49 --> 0:6:38,92
Terje really changed
the whole thing.


168
0:6:38,92 --> 0:6:42,32
I think he made it more fun
and more exciting for


169
0:6:42,32 --> 0:6:44,8
spectators and everybody.


170
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:49,31
ANDY COHGLAN: He came in and
he improved everyone.


171
0:6:49,31 --> 0:6:53,11
And he was one of those riders
that everyone started to copy


172
0:6:53,11 --> 0:6:55,61
because not only could he go
big, but he was also doing


173
0:6:55,61 --> 0:7:1,38
very technical tricks and really
pushed the direction to


174
0:7:1,38 --> 0:7:2,75
where it is today.


175
0:7:2,75 --> 0:7:4,57
DANNY KASS: Because at that
time, he was like this god.


176
0:7:4,57 --> 0:7:7,6
We didn't really know
much about him.


177
0:7:7,6 --> 0:7:11,375
We just knew that one day,
we wanted to be like him.


178
0:7:11,375 --> 0:7:14,36
And we kind of like snuck up
from behind and we just


179
0:7:14,36 --> 0:7:16,69
literally just like
touched him.


180
0:7:16,69 --> 0:7:18,41
And then he'd turn around,
look around.


181
0:7:18,41 --> 0:7:20,31
We'd kind of be like
there, like what?


182
0:7:20,31 --> 0:7:20,74
I don't know.


183
0:7:20,74 --> 0:7:21,73
Give him a weird look.


184
0:7:21,73 --> 0:7:22,59
And then he'd turn
around again.


185
0:7:22,59 --> 0:7:24,85
Then the next person in
the crew would go


186
0:7:24,85 --> 0:7:24,882
up and just be like--


187
0:7:24,882 --> 0:7:26,15
touch.


188
0:7:26,15 --> 0:7:30,35
And then we left, and it was
like, that was US Open 1998.


189
0:7:30,35 --> 0:7:32,68
SKY CHALMERS: There's a few
photos that really jump out to


190
0:7:32,68 --> 0:7:36,99
me when I think of all the
pictures I took at the Open.


191
0:7:36,99 --> 0:7:39,14
One definitely is Terje.


192
0:7:39,14 --> 0:7:43,72
CHRIS COPLEY: We used to do this
autograph session in this


193
0:7:43,72 --> 0:7:46,34
courtyard at the Open.


194
0:7:46,34 --> 0:7:47,94
And I mean, it would
be mayhem.


195
0:7:47,94 --> 0:7:50,5
There'd be 500, 600 people
in this courtyard.


196
0:7:50,5 --> 0:7:52,5
TOM MONTEROSSO: And there's that
big kind of clock tower


197
0:7:52,5 --> 0:7:55,39
hotel where all the riders
would stay and they would


198
0:7:55,39 --> 0:7:57,71
congregate up on
the top floor.


199
0:7:57,71 --> 0:8:2,8
CHRIS COPLEY: And Haakonsen was
on like the fifth story.


200
0:8:2,8 --> 0:8:6,52
And he opens up his window and
he had his board that he just


201
0:8:6,52 --> 0:8:7,6
won the pipe with.


202
0:8:7,6 --> 0:8:9,93
And he's dangling it
out the window.


203
0:8:9,93 --> 0:8:12,46
And he threw the board
out the window.


204
0:8:12,46 --> 0:8:14,43
Dude, it was like a riot.


205
0:8:14,43 --> 0:8:16,11
SKY CHALMERS: And then
there's a fight.


206
0:8:16,11 --> 0:8:18,38
People were going
after the board.


207
0:8:18,38 --> 0:8:20,22
I'm surprised someone
didn't get killed.


208
0:8:20,22 --> 0:8:24,97
CHRIS COPLEY: Every cop from
down that area was called in


209
0:8:24,97 --> 0:8:27,3
because people were just beating
on each other trying


210
0:8:27,3 --> 0:8:28,78
to grab Haakonsen's board.


211
0:8:28,78 --> 0:8:33,46
And that got ugly, and that's
where, whew, there were


212
0:8:33,46 --> 0:8:34,659
certain things that--


213
0:8:34,659 --> 0:8:36,52
certain rules got
put in place.


214
0:8:36,52 --> 0:8:39,71
BARRY DUGAN: You had this
convergence that was pretty


215
0:8:39,71 --> 0:8:44,36
rowdy snowboard-only,
not-made-for-TV event.


216
0:8:44,36 --> 0:8:47,2
It was for the snowboarding
industry.


217
0:8:47,2 --> 0:8:48,0
And that was pure.


218
0:8:48,0 --> 0:8:49,7
PAT BRIDGES: I mean, it was
easy to see what the


219
0:8:49,7 --> 0:8:52,24
importance of the US Open was
because it was the Olympics


220
0:8:52,24 --> 0:8:55,24
for freestyle snowboarding
before there was an Olympics.


221
0:8:55,24 --> 0:8:57,68
It was the X Games for freestyle
snowboarding before


222
0:8:57,68 --> 0:8:58,95
there was an X Games.


223
0:8:58,95 --> 0:9:1,79
And because it really
was universal.


224
0:9:1,79 --> 0:9:6,62
You would get everybody of
relevance who had a place of


225
0:9:6,62 --> 0:9:9,49
prominence within freestyle
snowboarding was there.


226
0:9:9,49 --> 0:9:13,2
TRICIA BYRNES: At that point,
you're getting to see like a


227
0:9:13,2 --> 0:9:16,6
bigger international field.


228
0:9:16,6 --> 0:9:17,56
It wasn't on television
as much, on the


229
0:9:17,56 --> 0:9:18,43
web, all that stuff.


230
0:9:18,43 --> 0:9:22,54
So people would come out to
see these Finnish or crazy


231
0:9:22,54 --> 0:9:24,61
Japanese riders that
you'd maybe heard


232
0:9:24,61 --> 0:9:25,7
about but never seen.


233
0:9:25,7 --> 0:9:28,65
And so I feel like there's a
lot of firsts at the Open.


234
0:9:28,65 --> 0:9:29,963
-Here he comes in the vert--


235
0:9:29,963 --> 0:9:33,811
huge frontside alley-oop,
putting that down smooth.


236
0:9:33,811 --> 0:9:38,14
Just a nice old frontside
grind there.


237
0:9:38,14 --> 0:9:41,8
KAZUHIRO KOKUBO: I won
two time US Open in


238
0:9:41,8 --> 0:9:43,826
2010 and the 2011.


239
0:9:43,826 --> 0:9:45,77
-[INAUDIBLE] got it going
on right now.


240
0:9:45,77 --> 0:9:46,742
Come on, [INAUDIBLE].


241
0:9:46,742 --> 0:9:48,686
-There's the double cork!


242
0:9:48,686 --> 0:9:50,63
Tighten that one down smooth!


243
0:9:50,63 --> 0:9:51,602
It's-- oh!


244
0:9:51,602 --> 0:9:55,91
KAZUHIRO KOKUBO: After that,
it's so much better with my


245
0:9:55,91 --> 0:9:56,9
snowboarding.


246
0:9:56,9 --> 0:10:1,23
Yeah, everything is so free.


247
0:10:1,23 --> 0:10:2,73
Yeah, it's so much fun.


248
0:10:2,73 --> 0:12:2,73
