0:0:4,99 --> 0:0:8,45
Hello, I'm Michael Dawson from Northern
Brewer and I'm brewing


2
0:0:8,45 --> 0:0:11,999
an all-grain batch with our deluxe all-grain system today.


3
0:0:11,999 --> 0:0:13,969
This is the five gallon version


4
0:0:13,969 --> 0:0:15,94
with two five-gallon coolers.


5
0:0:15,94 --> 0:0:19,39
We also have a ten gallon 
version with ten-gallon coolers.


6
0:0:19,39 --> 0:0:21,2
The five-gallon version


7
0:0:21,2 --> 0:0:23,32
is big enough for most


8
0:0:23,32 --> 0:0:27,46
five-gallon all-grain batches if you
brew mostly session beers,


9
0:0:27,46 --> 0:0:30,539
anything up to about doppelbock strength,


10
0:0:30,539 --> 0:0:34,98
you can use the system for years.. your
entire all-grain career and be totally happy.


11
0:0:34,98 --> 0:0:35,89



12
0:0:35,89 --> 0:0:40,17
If you brew ten-gallon batches or if you
start getting into really big beers like


13
0:0:40,17 --> 0:0:43,59
barleywines in the five-gallon size


14
0:0:43,59 --> 0:0:44,82
consider the ten-gallon system.


15
0:0:44,82 --> 0:0:49,43
The deluxe all-grain system 
includes two major components:


16
0:0:49,43 --> 0:0:52,73
the mash/lauter tun and the hot
liquor tank.


17
0:0:52,73 --> 0:0:56,69
This is a good moment to mention some
brewer's terminology.


18
0:0:56,69 --> 0:0:57,409



19
0:0:57,409 --> 0:1:0,32
"Liquor" in brewing doesn't refer to whiskey or
tequila,


20
0:1:0,32 --> 0:1:4,94
it refers to water that has been treated
for brewing. So the hot liquor tank


21
0:1:4,94 --> 0:1:6,41
is where we hold hot liquor


22
0:1:6,41 --> 0:1:8,29



23
0:1:8,29 --> 0:1:9,259
hot brewing water


24
0:1:9,259 --> 0:1:11,65
for the sparge.


25
0:1:11,65 --> 0:1:15,619
Mash/lauter tun is where we 
mash and lauter


26
0:1:15,619 --> 0:1:17,75
grain is mixed with hot water


27
0:1:17,75 --> 0:1:19,299
to create wort


28
0:1:19,299 --> 0:1:20,61



29
0:1:20,61 --> 0:1:23,83
and then lautered (or 
separated from the solids)


30
0:1:23,83 --> 0:1:28,82
and to accomplish that the mash
lauter tun has a perforated, domed


31
0:1:28,82 --> 0:1:32,509
stainless steel screen 
called a false bottom.


32
0:1:32,509 --> 0:1:34,38
that will keep the grain inside


33
0:1:34,38 --> 0:1:36,37
while letting the wort drain into
your boil kettle.


34
0:1:36,37 --> 0:1:38,24



35
0:1:38,24 --> 0:1:41,47
Some of the advantages of this system
are: insulation.


36
0:1:41,47 --> 0:1:45,1
Coolers will hold the temperature 
very well. When you're all-grain brewing,


37
0:1:45,1 --> 0:1:45,95



38
0:1:45,95 --> 0:1:50,4
the temperature of the mash is pretty
critical. It affects the outcome of the 
finished beer quite a bit.


39
0:1:50,4 --> 0:1:51,659



40
0:1:51,659 --> 0:1:56,929
Being able to hold a steady consistent mash temperature for hours on end is real plus.


41
0:1:56,929 --> 0:1:59,9



42
0:1:59,9 --> 0:2:3,81
All the coolers -- five and ten gallon -- also
include graduations inside


43
0:2:3,81 --> 0:2:5,11



44
0:2:5,11 --> 0:2:9,429
which makes measuring out 
your brewing water very easy.


45
0:2:9,429 --> 0:2:10,759



46
0:2:10,759 --> 0:2:15,399
Finally, draining and transferring liquid from
both of the vessel is as hands-free as just 
opening a valve and letting gravity do the hard work.


47
0:2:15,399 --> 0:2:18,329



48
0:2:18,329 --> 0:2:20,569



49
0:2:20,569 --> 0:2:23,62
When you get your deluxe all-grain
system there's a little bit of assembly
required but if I can do it, anybody can do it


50
0:2:23,62 --> 0:2:25,879



51
0:2:25,879 --> 0:2:26,999



52
0:2:26,999 --> 0:2:30,239
The coolers come with a factory spigot
installed.


53
0:2:30,239 --> 0:2:32,79
Before we can actually brew with it,


54
0:2:32,79 --> 0:2:33,689
we need to replace that


55
0:2:33,689 --> 0:2:36,649
with the ball valves like I've already
done on this one.


56
0:2:36,649 --> 0:2:40,449
Very easy you just need three things:


57
0:2:40,449 --> 0:2:42,34
crescent wrench


58
0:2:42,34 --> 0:2:44,369
pliers


59
0:2:44,369 --> 0:2:49,1
and a roll of teflon tape which is available
from Northern Brewer or a hardware store,


60
0:2:49,1 --> 0:2:52,309
which may be where you had to 
go to get these things anyways.


61
0:2:52,309 --> 0:2:57,439
Let's get into it.


62
0:2:57,439 --> 0:3:1,219
There's a nut and a spigot on the inside fo the cooler


63
0:3:1,219 --> 0:3:2,529
that needs to be removed,


64
0:3:2,529 --> 0:3:4,549
to take the spigot out.


65
0:3:4,549 --> 0:3:9,709
I've already looseen in this one up a bit
with the crescent wrench


66
0:3:9,709 --> 0:3:11,629
so i can finish getting it


67
0:3:11,629 --> 0:3:16,419
by hand.


68
0:3:16,419 --> 0:3:20,349
Three pieces - there's the nut


69
0:3:20,349 --> 0:3:21,109
gasket


70
0:3:21,109 --> 0:3:22,829
and the spigot itself.


71
0:3:22,829 --> 0:3:25,599
The valve assemblies 
have two components:


72
0:3:25,599 --> 0:3:29,19
the bulkhead which goes inside the
cooler...


73
0:3:29,19 --> 0:3:30,709
and the valve proper


74
0:3:30,709 --> 0:3:33,759
which goes on the outside of the cooler
like you can see


75
0:3:33,759 --> 0:3:35,359
on this one here.


76
0:3:35,359 --> 0:3:38,519
The bulkhead itself as a few parts


77
0:3:38,519 --> 0:3:41,469
but the two we need to be concerned with


78
0:3:41,469 --> 0:3:44,239
are the big hex nut...


79
0:3:44,239 --> 0:3:47,699
and a big silicone O-ring.


80
0:3:47,699 --> 0:3:49,549
These go on the outside of the cooler.


81
0:3:49,549 --> 0:3:50,87



82
0:3:50,87 --> 0:3:52,25
The rest of the bulkhead
goes on the inside.


83
0:3:52,25 --> 0:3:53,699



84
0:3:53,699 --> 0:3:57,189
The bulkhead goes inside their cooler


85
0:3:57,189 --> 0:4:0,229
with coupling facing in,


86
0:4:0,229 --> 0:4:5,999
and threaded nipple facing out.


87
0:4:5,999 --> 0:4:8,909
Back on the outside


88
0:4:8,909 --> 0:4:11,9
the big O-ring


89
0:4:11,9 --> 0:4:13,919
gets snugged up against
the cooler wall


90
0:4:13,919 --> 0:4:16,59
followed by the hex nut


91
0:4:16,59 --> 0:4:21,419
with the flat side facing out.


92
0:4:21,419 --> 0:4:25,229
Hand-tighten.


93
0:4:25,229 --> 0:4:28,689
And use the crescent wrench on the outside...


94
0:4:28,689 --> 0:4:37,33
the pliers on the inside to hold the
coupling...


95
0:4:37,33 --> 0:4:40,699
tighten it down.


96
0:4:40,699 --> 0:4:44,139
Next, we use a few inches of teflon tape


97
0:4:44,139 --> 0:4:46,879
to wrap the threads


98
0:4:46,879 --> 0:4:49,169
and help make a watertight seal


99
0:4:49,169 --> 0:4:57,339
when we put the ball valve on.


100
0:4:57,339 --> 0:5:11,679
 [tightening components]


101
0:5:11,679 --> 0:5:34,189
Finally, a little more teflon tape to wrap the
threads of the barbed fitting into the ball valve.
 [tightening]


102
0:5:34,189 --> 0:5:41,959



103
0:5:41,959 --> 0:5:46,3
Now that we're ready for brewday, we need one
more piece  of sophisticated equipment


104
0:5:46,3 --> 0:5:48,189
to make a gravity fed, tiered, brewing system.


105
0:5:48,189 --> 0:5:48,93



106
0:5:48,93 --> 0:5:54,65
[moves chair across floor]


107
0:5:54,65 --> 0:5:58,179
Hot liquor tank will be the highest
point


108
0:5:58,179 --> 0:6:0,969
mash/lauter tun in the middle


109
0:6:0,969 --> 0:6:4,9
and your boil kettle of choice which is not
included with the all-grain system


110
0:6:4,9 --> 0:6:6,44
will be on the floor


111
0:6:6,44 --> 0:6:9,71
to receive the wort 
from the mash/lauter tun.


112
0:6:9,71 --> 0:6:14,74
To transfer the liquid from vessel to  
vessel, the deluxe all-grain system


113
0:6:14,74 --> 0:6:17,639
come with a couple sets of hoses.


114
0:6:17,639 --> 0:6:20,989
There's a clear, high-temperature hose


115
0:6:20,989 --> 0:6:26,259
to drain the mash/lauter tun 
into the boil kettle.


116
0:6:26,259 --> 0:6:30,2
Clear hose allows you to evaluate the
color and clarity of the wort


117
0:6:30,2 --> 0:6:34,449
coming out of the mash/lauter tun.
The second hose is an opaque


118
0:6:34,449 --> 0:6:36,3
high-temperature hose


119
0:6:36,3 --> 0:6:39,779
to drain sparge water from the hot liquor
tank


120
0:6:39,779 --> 0:6:43,8
into the mash/lauter tun.


121
0:6:43,8 --> 0:6:45,389
This piece has a diverter tip, 
a little siphon sprayer on the end


122
0:6:45,389 --> 0:6:48,529



123
0:6:48,529 --> 0:6:49,97
to diffuse


124
0:6:49,97 --> 0:6:52,249
the hot water coming out


125
0:6:52,249 --> 0:6:54,49
and deliver a gentle trickleinstead of


126
0:6:54,49 --> 0:6:56,41
a full-bore stream


127
0:6:56,41 --> 0:6:59,96
that could channel a hole 
straight down into the grain bed


128
0:6:59,96 --> 0:7:3,9
and have some adverse effects 
on the finished beer.


129
0:7:3,9 --> 0:7:10,999
To actually start moving liquid all you
have to do is open one valve...


130
0:7:10,999 --> 0:7:15,459
open another valve...


131
0:7:15,459 --> 0:7:18,669
and wort will be flowing into the boil
kettle.


132
0:7:18,669 --> 0:7:20,66
Leaving both hands free for beer


133
0:7:20,66 --> 0:7:22,11



134
0:7:22,11 --> 0:7:25,529
or more important things like taking
notes.


135
0:7:25,529 --> 0:7:28,729
This is the deluxe all grain system from
northern brewer.


136
0:7:28,729 --> 0:9:28,729
Happy brewing and cheers!
