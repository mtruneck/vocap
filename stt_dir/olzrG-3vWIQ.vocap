###0 THURMAN SEWELL: I have some twin people that hit us up
###1 like, "Yeah, we're like you guys." I'm like, "No, no
###3 you're not." You know what I mean?
###5 You're just not.
###7 SIDNEY SEWELL: You'll never have street cred, homie.
###8 You know what I'm saying?
###9 Like, you'll never get down.
###11 THURMAN SEWELL: Never get down.
###12 SIDNEY SEWELL: [INAUDIBLE] to get where we're at.
###14 [MAAL THE PIMP, "CHATTANOOGA"]
###28 -Let's start at the beginning, I mean.
###30 Chattanooga, Tennessee.
###31 Have you guys ever been to Chattanooga?
###33 SIDNEY SEWELL: Well, Chattanooga's actually a big
###34 touristy because they have the aquarium, they have like this
###37 Rock City bullshit.
###39 I don't know how other people might perceive it, but the way
###41 we grew up there, and where we grew up at was fucking gnarly.
###44 THURMAN SEWELL: It's really a ghetto-ass
###45 little fucking town.
###48 CHRIS SCOGGINS: The first thing you're going to see is
###50 the East Lake courts.
###53 Look at those beautiful buildings there.
###55 This is the most dangerous projects in Chattanooga.
###58 
###61 Any one of these streets right here you turn down the wrong
###63 time of day will get you killed, or it
###66 might get you laid.
###68 SIDNEY SEWELL: When we were kids we would like, you know,
###70 fuck with hookers.
###71 THURMAN SEWELL: It was so sketchy.
###71 You'd be outside, and these fucking creepos would come up,
###75 "You need a ride?"
###76 CHRIS NIERATKO: Really?
###77 THURMAN SEWELL: People have tried to kidnap us before.
###79 SIDNEY SEWELL: Like why would they be wanting
###80 to give us a ride?
###80 You're fucking creeps trying to butt-fuck us.
###83 You know what I mean?
###86 CHRIS SCOGGINS: Look at this one.
###86 They got more junk in the front yard
###88 than 10 houses combined.
###90 There's a cop right there, just hanging out, talking to
###92 the dope dealers.
###93 Smell the stuff cooking.
###96 SIDNEY SEWELL: We grew up super in like poverty.
###98 You know what I mean?
###98 Like on food stamps, our dad was disabled, so we got like
###102 these checks every month.
###103 It was just super ghetto.
###106 Our parents, the way they raised was they told us
###108 everything, like how it was.
###110 You know what I mean?
###110 THURMAN SEWELL: We watched R-rated movies when we were
###111 five years old.
###112 CHRIS NIERATKO: So you look at that as a good thing?
###114 THURMAN SEWELL: Yeah.
###114 SIDNEY SEWELL: Yeah, 'cause we got brought up to see life how
###117 it really is.
###118 CHRIS NIERATKO: How many sisters you got?
###120 SEWELL BROTHERS: Two.
###121 SIDNEY SEWELL: Nah, man.
###121 You know what's crazy is one of our
###123 sisters went to Harvard.
###124 THURMAN SEWELL: Studied her whole life.
###125 Got this like financial aid into the private schools, and
###128 we were kind of like counting on her to be like the family
###130 fortune, like fuck this shit.
###131 We're just gonna skate, and she'll be rich one day, and
###134 we're not gonna have to do fucking shit.
###135 You know what I mean?
###135 Like we really had that mentality.
###137 SIDNEY SEWELL: We never even went to high school.
###139 CHRIS NIERATKO: Really?
###140 SIDNEY SEWELL: We went to fucking half of eighth grade,
###142 and like school?
###143 Fuck school.
###144 We always hated school.
###145 All right?
###146 We always got fucked with at school.
###147 Like I'm sure now like in school, skate boarders are
###150 popular kids.
###151 It was not like that.
###152 CHRIS NIERATKO: So eighth grade is as
###153 far as you guys got?
###154 SIDNEY SEWELL: Yeah.
###154 Still to this day, I hate it.
###155 THURMAN SEWELL: I don't regret quitting.
###156 SIDNEY SEWELL: I don't want to go to any school.
###158 People try to get us to go back to school.
###160 No.
###161 We were bad kids, yo.
###162 We were just fucking punks.
###164 We didn't go to school.
###165 We didn't do shit except skate.
###167 CHRIS NIERATKO: How about when your mom left?
###169 She left your old man.
###171 Why did she leave?
###172 What was the reason?
###173 SIDNEY SEWELL: She was unhappy.
###174 THURMAN SEWELL: He was disabled, and she wanted to
###176 live her life.
###176 SIDNEY SEWELL: She had four fucking kids her whole
###178 god-damned life.
###179 THURMAN SEWELL: She got married when she was 16.
###181 She was just over it.
###182 She wanted to go live life.
###183 SIDNEY SEWELL: So she did.
###185 Mom left dad when we were like 12.
###187 We were really close to our dad, you know what I mean?
###190 Our dad--
###191 THURMAN SEWELL: He had gotten a pacemaker.
###192 SIDNEY SEWELL: It was just sketchy, kind of, and he'd
###194 take insulin, take all this shit, diabetes.
###196 THURMAN SEWELL: He would take about 50
###197 different pills a day.
###198 Like it was just crazy, I mean it was crazy.
###200 CHRIS NIERATKO: And were you guys responsible for taking
###202 care of him?
###202 THURMAN SEWELL: Somewhat.
###204 We watched our dad die.
###206 CHRIS NIERATKO: What happened?
###208 SIDNEY SEWELL: What happened was, man, I won't get too deep
###210 into it 'cause it's pretty emotional, but--
###212 THURMAN SEWELL: So he just woke us up one morning.
###213 It's a Saturday, wakes us up like, "I don't feel good."
###215 SIDNEY SEWELL: He got up--
###216 THURMAN SEWELL: He starts going like that, he starts
###217 blacking out, and we're like, fuck.
###218 What the fuck, you know?
###219 SIDNEY SEWELL: So I called 911, and they were like uh,
###223 telling us how to do mouth to mouth and all
###226 that type of shit.
###226 THURMAN SEWELL: We tried all that.
###227 SIDNEY SEWELL: We tried, and it wasn't working.
###228 THURMAN SEWELL: Then the ambulance showed up, and they
###229 were like doing the electric shocks, and we
###230 just kind of left.
###231 SIDNEY SEWELL: We were freaked out.
###232 THURMAN SEWELL: We didn't want to believe it.
###233 SIDNEY SEWELL: We were really hysterical.
###234 THURMAN SEWELL: We thought, like all right, he'll be all
###235 right, because they took him away.
###236 SIDNEY SEWELL: But deep down we knew.
###237 THURMAN SEWELL: We knew, but then we get a call like an
###240 hour later, our aunts called, like yeah, your dad's dead.
###244 It was just crazy.
###247 CHRIS NIERATKO: What's the relationship with your mom?
###249 SIDNEY SEWELL: We were all bitter about it, because we
###251 thought it was fucked up that she left.
###254 THURMAN SEWELL: So anyway, so we're in
###255 Chattanooga, whatever.
###256 My mom was in Knoxville, so after our dad died, we were
###259 forced to move to Knoxville, Tennessee,
###261 SIDNEY SEWELL: There's a guy--
###261 THURMAN SEWELL: Another shit hole.
###262 SIDNEY SEWELL: All right, but there's a guy we met named
###264 Chris Scoggins, who was five years older than us, and he
###270 lived right around the corner from us.
###272 CHRIS SCOGGINS: That was like early '90s, pulled up into
###274 this hood-ass neighborhood and saw these two cats sitting on
###277 the front porch, and these two kids like finishing each
###281 other's sentences.
###282 I can't tell them apart, like fucking long-ass black hair
###286 with like Misfits skateboards.
###288 And we just start kicking it every day, just skating out in
###291 front of the house and fucking with the neighborhood kids and
###294 getting into fights and shit, and fucking with the
###295 prostitutes.
###296 They walk by, we holler at 'em.
###298 And I guess in turn, yeah, we taught each
###300 other how to skate.
###301 
###304 SIDNEY SEWELL: He really showed us the way as far as
###306 like everything, what's cool.
###308 So we started skating in the hood, and we waxed this curb
###311 up at a Dollar General store, and we really got into
###314 skateboarding for real and really started skating.
###316 
###321 CHRIS SCOGGINS: I was skating a lot, but when I met those
###323 dudes, they taught me the difference between cake flip,
###325 Nollie flip, switchfoot, fakie flip.
###327 Taught me fucking who Pepe Martinez was, who Mike Carroll
###331 was, who Stevie Williams was.
###333 I didn't know all that.
###334 I just skated.
###335 Sidney and Thurman were my favorite skaters.
###339 THURMAN SEWELL: It was amazing.
###339 We had the time of our life.
###342 We just skated.
###343 SIDNEY SEWELL: All we did was skate.
###344 THURMAN SEWELL: Every day, all day, and then just party.
###347 
###351 JON NEWPORT: At the time, we were all catching rides to get
###354 to downtown Atlanta to go skate, and we would go skate
###357 with all the older heads, 'cause we were kind of on the
###359 same shit, and there was this graffiti yard called 40 Yard
###362 in midtown Atlanta.
###364 
###367 Man, we all used to skate 40 Yard.
###369 We all helped build it, and the twins used to come down,
###373 and they wouldn't talk much, but they were ripping always.
###377 
###381 Man, it was just a time.
###382 
###388 CHRIS NIERATKO: I saw old footage.
###388 These guys were good.
###390 Why didn't you pursue skateboarding?
###391 THURMAN SEWELL: Well, we did it in the way we thought we
###393 were, but deep down that shit's like making NBA, you
###397 know what I'm saying?
###398 That was a dream.
###399 That was everybody's fucking dream.
###402 SIDNEY SEWELL: Really, our dream was just to get free
###404 shit, like--
###405 THURMAN SEWELL: A box.
###405 SIDNEY SEWELL: Like get a box.
###406 THURMAN SEWELL: That was amazing.
###407 CHRIS NIERATKO: You never thought to go to California?
###409 THURMAN SEWELL: We did, but I think we were
###410 just scared back then.
###412 I think if we would've been around people like
###415 Pearson and all that.
###417 SIDNEY SEWELL: Now we're homeless brothers.
###419 THURMAN SEWELL: It was like we fit right in with them.
###420 You know what I'm saying?
###421 If he would have just been around back then, we could
###423 have made it, I think.
###426 JOSH KALIS: The first time I met the ATL twins, I think
###428 they were called like the Kalis twins in Atlanta for
###430 awhile or something like that, we just clicked, man.
###433 Dudes were cool.
###435 They got kind of the same history as me when it comes to
###438 like the way we grew up and the way our families were and
###441 all that type of shit.
###442 Not to mention, they're full street skaters.
###445 They rip.
###447 They know pretty much everything that's has to do
###449 with any type of skateboarding.
###452 I'm psyched every time I see 'em.
###455 CHRIS NIERATKO: So this is the playground.
###459 THURMAN SEWELL: Yeah, man, this is fucking crazy.
###461 SIDNEY SEWELL: Yeah, this place is amazing, like this is
###463 a bougie-ass mall.
###465 This is a bougie mall.
###466 THURMAN SEWELL: This is like Stevie Williams' park.
###468 
###472 SIDNEY SEWELL: You never know who you'll bump into here.
###474 Anthony Williams.
###478 ANTHONY WILLIAMS: What's up?
###479 SIDNEY SEWELL: It's just fucking private and it's dope.
###482 THURMAN SEWELL: Tupac piece up there.
###483 SIDNEY SEWELL: Like a lot of fucking people came in here
###486 and really tag it up.
###488 Manual pad, fucking ledge.
###490 Little ledges.
###491 
###495 Damn, Dorian.
###497 Slow down, man.
###498 THURMAN SEWELL: Slow down.
###500 
###503 Yeah.
###504 Hell, yeah.
###504 By the [INAUDIBLE].
###505 We're gonna skate and see what we can come up with.
###507 For us, we don't get to skate every day, but we're gonna see
###509 what we can do.
###510 
###517 We're not those dudes.
###518 We still love it, but the act of doing it, I just wanna
###522 drink and fuck bitches.
###522 I don't wanna skate.
###524 I'm not 13 years old anymore.
