1
0:0:23,101 --> 0:0:27,261
My life is in stages, you know what I
mean?


2
0:0:27,261 --> 0:0:31,98
We the jury of in the above-entitled action, find the defendent
Calvin Broadus


3
0:0:31,98 --> 0:0:34,635
not guilty of the crime of murder in
the first degree.


4
0:0:34,635 --> 0:0:37,671
Whether it's me performing live on
stage...


5
0:0:37,671 --> 0:0:41,575
Let me hear you say "Snoop Dogg!"
-Snoop Dogg!


6
0:0:41,575 --> 0:0:44,611
Or me going through stages in life.


7
0:0:44,611 --> 0:0:47,548
That's what my life has always been
based on.


8
0:0:47,548 --> 0:0:57,825
And that's what forced me to find
a new path.


9
0:0:57,825 --> 0:1:0,761
Snoop Dogg is still in Jamaica,


10
0:1:0,761 --> 0:1:4,431
observing and participating in
authentic Jamaican culture.


11
0:1:4,431 --> 0:1:12,173
The prodigal son returns.


12
0:1:12,173 --> 0:1:15,776
I've been on the top ever since I've
been in it.


13
0:1:15,776 --> 0:1:20,46
I've got rap songs that will never
die.


14
0:1:20,46 --> 0:1:24,451
I think with no disrespect, but,
I'm tired of rapping.


15
0:1:24,451 --> 0:1:28,388
I wanna do a record, a whole record,
with no rapping.


16
0:1:28,388 --> 0:1:32,46
Fuck Snoop Dogg. Don't think about
none of the shit he rapped about,


17
0:1:32,46 --> 0:1:36,3
hustling and making money and drug
dealing and shooting.


18
0:1:36,3 --> 0:1:48,943
All that shit be out of here.


19
0:1:48,943 --> 0:1:52,13
I didn't just wanna come here, say I
made a record in Jamaica


20
0:1:52,13 --> 0:1:53,313
and grew some dreadlocks.


21
0:1:53,313 --> 0:2:3,456
Rastafari called me.


22
0:2:3,456 --> 0:2:6,895
I finally made it to paradise.


23
0:2:6,895 --> 0:2:9,63
Bless up - Snoop Lion!


24
0:2:9,63 --> 0:2:10,965
Jah said to love thee one to another


25
0:2:10,965 --> 0:2:15,57
for him that loveth is of Jah!


26
0:2:15,57 --> 0:4:15,57
<i>Come hit some of this Californian [weed] one
time. Calm your nerves!</i>
