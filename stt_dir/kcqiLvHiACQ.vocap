###3 ROBERT ALEXANDER: If you'd asked me five years ago,
###5 Robert, where will you be five years from now?
###7 I don't think I would've been able to come up with an answer
###11 as cool as what I actually feel like I'm doing, you know?

###39 ROBERT ALEXANDER: My name is Robert Alexander.
###41 And I'm a data sonification specialist with the Solar and
###44 Heliospheric Research Group.
###45 To sonify something just means that you're taking any type of
###49 data and just turning it into sound.
###51 So it could be a measurement of the stock market.
###54 It could be a measurement of people entering
###57 and exiting a room.
###58 It could be your heartbeat.
###59 So if you think about a heart rate monitor--
###61 beep, beep--
###63 essentially, this is a sonification
###65 of someone's pulse.
###66 
###72 I think of myself as an explorer.
###74 I live in the space between art, and science, and
###79 technology.
###80 And the Toroidal Universe project is a great example.
###82 I collaborated with this amazing visual artist by the
###85 name of Danielle Battaglia.
###86 And we created this multi-sensory experience in
###89 which people, they can just get lost in these theoretical
###92 higher dimensional spaces.
###94 And these were filled with these sounds that I generated
###97 from raw satellite data that were these kind of guide posts
###100 as you move around.
###101 
###124 It really is important for me to remain grounded in what it
###128 means to just be connected with the world of sound in a
###131 very tangible, very visceral way.
###133 So then when I go off and I'm interacting with the sun, it
###137 gives me a sense of grounding in a sense.
###139 And it kind of helps just round out my life and to
###142 maintain a healthy sort of balance, I
###144 guess you could say.
###145 
###148 So as I was finishing up my master's degree, I was
###150 approached by Thomas Zurbuchen who leads the Solar and
###152 Heliospheric Research Group.
###154 And he was interested in taking some other data and
###156 turning it into sound.
###157 So I met with their team.
###158 And they put up a bunch of plots.
###160 And they were telling me about coronal holes, and they were
###162 throwing out this scientific jargon.
###164 And I really didn't understand much of it.
###166 But then they put up these images and these movies.
###169 
###177 And then I really started to understand why
###179 they were so excited.
###180 It's because what's happening out there is absolutely
###183 amazing, and it was all silent.
###185 So essentially they're interested in kind of creating
###187 a soundtrack for these things that are taking
###190 place out in space.
###191 
###194 SUSAN LEPRI: He brought to us this idea of sonifying data,
###199 which is really quite innovative and maybe even
###204 transformative.
###204 ROBERT ALEXANDER: I had no idea what data
###205 audification was.
###207 But that's what I was doing at the time is I was taking this
###210 solar data, and I was writing it directly into audio files.
###214 So I hit play.
###215 And I hear this underlying hum.
###220 And there seemed to be a structure.
###221 The hum would rise and fall.
###224 So then after I crunched all the numbers, I realized that
###228 what I was listening to was something that was
###230 periodically happening every roughly 27 days.
###233 And that's exactly the rotational period of the sun.
###238 
###242 And then, from there it was this journey of realizing that
###244 I'm listening to the solar cycle, so the rise and the
###246 fall in solar activity.
###249 And then, at that point, I realized this can really
###252 actually teach us something new.
###254 
###267 At first, it came off as extremely cerebral.
###271 And it was just a tone that kind of went up and down.
###273 And there really wasn't very much emotion behind it.
###276 And we really didn't know how we wanted to start to
###278 investigate these sounds.
###280 So then as it evolved, they said, well, how about we try
###283 an emotional journey?
###284 So a week later, I came back, and I had created this
###287 iteration whereby you take a journey from the Earth out to
###290 the sun and back, with sonification audio underlying
###294 this whole entire experience.
###295 
###302 Every single piece of that music is driven in some way,
###307 shape, or form by that data.
###309 And all of the choices in terms of the rise and the
###312 fall, all of them relate back to the underlying data.
###315 And all of them are true to the data in some
###317 way, shape, or form.
###319 
###324 Starting with one of the more predominant things that you're
###326 actually hearing is that drumbeat.
###328 There's a question of are there African tribal drummers
###331 on the surface of the sun?
###332 And the answer is no.
###333 But if you think about a scientific graph, there are
###337 hash marks.
###338 And you need these hash marks to make sense.
###340 
###345 What the drum beat is is it's a sort of grandiose metronome,
###349 in a sense.
###350 And it just lets you know where you are
###352 within this data set.
###353 So for that piece with the drumming that's all over the
###355 year 2003, and the drumming actually lets you, like every
###359 eight bars, that you've gone through one full
###361 rotation of the sun.
###363 And in a sense, if you hear something that happens at the
###365 beginning of the bar and then you hear something happen
###368 again, similarly, at the beginning eight bars later,
###371 then you know that this might be a feature that's persisted
###374 across an entire solar rotation now, and it's coming
###376 back in the musical form.
###378 And the sun then provides the structure and can provide
###381 these sort of recurring themes.
###383 And the drums just give it that structure
###385 within which to evolve.
###386 
###392 I recorded the voice of my sister, Amanda Alexander.
###395 And she has a great alto voice.
###397 And originally I was thinking about these charge states of
###400 carbon, and the fact that as one of them goes up, another
###404 one comes down.
###405 And so when you have a lower voice versus a higher voice,
###409 there's actually more energy pushing out
###411 those higher notes.
###412 So when I'm representing a higher energetic state, I'm
###415 using a more energized voice.
###417 And in this way, it's kind of appealing directly to the
###419 intuition of the listener in that when you hear these
###422 voices get more energized, you're at a higher energy
###425 level coming from the sun, essentially.
###427 
###436 I create a structure.
###438 I create a framework.
###440 And without the data driving that framework,
###443 nothing takes place.
###445 So the structure just kind of exists on its own.
###448 And then it's the data that creates all the motion, that
###450 creates all the interaction, and all the
###452 progression of the music.
###453 
###458 SUSAN LEPRI: Initially, it started out sort of more
###461 looking at the aesthetics of how can you sonify solar wind?
###466 And it was a musical sort of approach.
###468 But then it evolved more into a scientific
###471 data analysis method.
###473 
###476 When he was working with the scientists here, Enrico Landi,
###479 who is, I believe, the first author on the paper, he found
###483 that he could actually hear some of the trends more
###486 clearly in some of the elements.
###488 ROBERT ALEXANDER: I was digging through like 20, 30
###491 different data parameters and listening to them all.
###493 And I realized that if I listened to carbon that I
###496 could hear a very strong, harmonic presence.
###500 And I started to think, if I'm hearing carbon here, but no
###504 one in the group has ever really been
###505 talking about carbon.
###506 It's not really something that they
###508 stress as being important.
###509 And yet, here, fundamentally, this is one of the strongest
###513 periodic signals that I had found up to that point.
###516 I'm thinking maybe this is something worth looking into a
###518 little bit more.
###519 
###521 We were able to figure out that, if we use carbon, that
###526 we can trace the origins of the solar wind
###529 with a higher accuracy.
###530 So we can figure out where it's originating on the sun.
###536 SUSAN LEPRI: This was fairly significant research findings
###541 that came out of this audification thing.
###543 So it really, I think, set the stage for Robert to do a lot
###548 more exciting things with the sonification of data.
###551 ROBERT ALEXANDER: We wrote everything up.
###553 And we said that the ear can be an extremely powerful tool
###557 in the analysis of this type of data, of time series data.
###560 And some people at NASA, I guess, got excited about that.
###563 And they said, all right, let's give it a shot.
###565 And so now I'm in the second year of my NASA JPFP
###569 fellowship.
###569 And I spent the last summer working at NASA Goddard.
###571 And I was really amazed at how eager they all were to pick up
###575 the ball with sonification.
###576 And so it was really invigorating to be in that
###578 kind of space with those kinds of minds and to be tackling
###582 these kinds of ideas.
###584 
###589 We forget that the most powerful tool that we have for
###592 exploring the universe is right between our two ears.
###596 And those same two ears provide a wealth of
###599 information beyond what our eyes can actually see.
###603 When we open up our ears and open up our minds, we open
###607 ourselves up to an entirely new way of
###610 understanding the universe.
