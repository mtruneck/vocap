2
0:0:8,88 --> 0:0:11,36
SHANE SMITH: To understand the
Iranian cinema, you have to


3
0:0:11,36 --> 0:0:14,13
understand the recent history
of Iran itself.


4
0:0:14,13 --> 0:0:16,855
In the 1960s, there was the
Shah of Iran, or the king.


5
0:0:16,855 --> 0:0:20,32
And he was very pro-Western, so
lots of pro-Western movies


6
0:0:20,32 --> 0:0:22,94
that were kind of sexy comedies
with girls in bikinis


7
0:0:22,94 --> 0:0:23,92
and sport cars.


8
0:0:23,92 --> 0:0:27,41
Then came the Islamic Revolution
in 1979, led by the


9
0:0:27,41 --> 0:0:30,8
Ayatollah Khomeini, the one
everybody knows about.


10
0:0:30,8 --> 0:0:31,21
He came along.


11
0:0:31,21 --> 0:0:32,59
And then they burned cinemas as


12
0:0:32,59 --> 0:0:33,81
symbols of Western decadence.


13
0:0:33,81 --> 0:0:36,885
Cinema was actually outlawed
for a while.


14
0:0:36,885 --> 0:0:38,54
Then they took over the
American embassy.


15
0:0:38,54 --> 0:0:40,4
And there was a hostage
crisis.


16
0:0:40,4 --> 0:0:43,12
So movies became filled with
propaganda against the West.


17
0:0:43,12 --> 0:0:45,6
After that there was
the Iran-Iraq War.


18
0:0:45,6 --> 0:0:48,7
The Americans backed the Iraqis
to attack Iran, which


19
0:0:48,7 --> 0:0:50,29
became the eighth bloodiest
war in history.


20
0:0:50,29 --> 0:0:53,579
So lots of war films, lots of
anti-Iraqi films, and lots of


21
0:0:53,579 --> 0:0:54,812
anti-Western films were made.


22
0:0:54,812 --> 0:0:58,756
[EXPLOSIONS]


23
0:0:58,756 --> 0:1:0,53
SHANE SMITH: Then, as the war
ended, there were all these


24
0:1:0,53 --> 0:1:1,62
film crews around.


25
0:1:1,62 --> 0:1:2,89
So they started making movies.


26
0:1:2,89 --> 0:1:5,82
And this begins a renaissance
in Iranian cinema.


27
0:1:5,82 --> 0:1:7,86
And despite all the restrictions
and censorship


28
0:1:7,86 --> 0:1:10,59
and propaganda, these amazingly
creative films were


29
0:1:10,59 --> 0:1:12,73
sneaking out of Iran and getting
critically acclaimed.


30
0:1:12,73 --> 0:1:16,82
And then in 1997, the world
really sat up and took notice,


31
0:1:16,82 --> 0:1:18,515
when "Taste of Cherry" won
the Palme d'Or in Cannes.


32
0:1:18,515 --> 0:1:22,11
And its director, Abbas
Kiarostami, became a worldwide


33
0:1:22,11 --> 0:1:23,36
figure in film.


34
0:1:23,36 --> 0:1:25,0
Since then, you always
see Iranian


35
0:1:25,0 --> 0:1:26,16
films at the film festivals.


36
0:1:26,16 --> 0:1:28,877
And their content has become
much more critical, dealing


37
0:1:28,877 --> 0:1:31,594
with things that were taboo
before, like women, fucked up


38
0:1:31,594 --> 0:1:35,52
war veterans, Afghan refugees,
and the poor.


39
0:1:35,52 --> 0:1:37,31
The next stop on the film
tour of Tehran was the


40
0:1:37,31 --> 0:1:38,66
Iranian Film Museum.


41
0:1:38,66 --> 0:1:41,75
They had the usual photos and
awards and posters, and my


42
0:1:41,75 --> 0:1:43,87
favorite, wax figures.


43
0:1:43,87 --> 0:1:45,42
So this is Ezzatollah.


44
0:1:45,42 --> 0:1:50,1
He's their big star from before
the revolution and


45
0:1:50,1 --> 0:1:51,54
after the revolution.


46
0:1:51,54 --> 0:1:54,3
There is the children's
section.


47
0:1:54,3 --> 0:1:56,42
I don't know if you can get
a good shot of this.


48
0:1:56,42 --> 0:1:58,24
Maybe it's not the way
he used to be.


49
0:1:58,24 --> 0:1:59,89
But it's scary.


50
0:1:59,89 --> 0:2:1,64
Thank god I'm not on acid.


51
0:2:1,64 --> 0:2:3,33
These two guys are
freaking me out.


52
0:2:3,33 --> 0:2:5,931



53
0:2:5,931 --> 0:2:8,69
The one thing that we did learn
at the museum was how


54
0:2:8,69 --> 0:2:11,44
the Ayatollah Khomeini
saved Iranian cinema.


55
0:2:11,44 --> 0:2:14,73
In 1979, people were burning
cinemas, and no one was making


56
0:2:14,73 --> 0:2:15,84
any movies.


57
0:2:15,84 --> 0:2:17,77
Then one day the Ayatollah
was at home.


58
0:2:17,77 --> 0:2:18,55
He's watching TV.


59
0:2:18,55 --> 0:2:20,7
And out comes a movie called
"The Cow," which is a


60
0:2:20,7 --> 0:2:22,33
pre-revolutionary movie.


61
0:2:22,33 --> 0:2:23,9
But it's not a sexy comedy.


62
0:2:23,9 --> 0:2:26,23
It's about real people
with real problems.


63
0:2:26,23 --> 0:2:28,12
He watched it and he
said, actually,


64
0:2:28,12 --> 0:2:29,48
I'm not against cinema.


65
0:2:29,48 --> 0:2:31,72
I'm against promiscuity.


66
0:2:31,72 --> 0:2:34,8
So that one line, just that
one sentence, and bam.


67
0:2:34,8 --> 0:2:36,36
They stopped burning cinemas.


68
0:2:36,36 --> 0:2:37,73
They started making
films again.


69
0:2:37,73 --> 0:2:40,75
And that one sentence saved
Iranian cinema.


70
0:2:40,75 --> 0:2:44,25



71
0:2:44,25 --> 0:2:46,46
So that actor in the wheelchair,
on the film set,


72
0:2:46,46 --> 0:2:48,42
is Jamshid Mashayekhi.


73
0:2:48,42 --> 0:2:51,36
He was actually in "The Cow,"
the film that not only saved


74
0:2:51,36 --> 0:2:53,91
Iranian cinema, but is actually
credited by being the


75
0:2:53,91 --> 0:2:55,68
first in the Iranian
New Wave movement.


76
0:2:55,68 --> 0:2:59,17



77
0:2:59,17 --> 0:3:1,48
Now what is Iranian
new wave cinema?


78
0:3:1,48 --> 0:3:3,715
Well it's kind of a combination
between French New


79
0:3:3,715 --> 0:3:7,3
Wave cinema, Italian neorealism,
fiction,


80
0:3:7,3 --> 0:3:10,43
documentary filmmaking, all
mixed up into one, with all


81
0:3:10,43 --> 0:3:11,8
the restrictions
of Sharia law.


82
0:3:11,8 --> 0:3:12,79
So you can't have kissing.


83
0:3:12,79 --> 0:3:14,84
And you can't have
hand holding.


84
0:3:14,84 --> 0:3:18,53
So the Spielberg and Lucas of
Iranian new wave cinema are


85
0:3:18,53 --> 0:3:21,14
Mohsen Makhmalbaf and
Abbas Kiarostami.


86
0:3:21,14 --> 0:3:24,18
Now the star of Kiarostami's
film, "Taste of Cherry,"


87
0:3:24,18 --> 0:3:26,55
Homayoun Ershadi, was
actually at the next


88
0:3:26,55 --> 0:3:27,585
film set we went to.


89
0:3:27,585 --> 0:3:29,62
And I was like, hey,
I recognize you.


90
0:3:29,62 --> 0:3:32,6
Because he was in "The
Kite Runner" as well.


91
0:3:32,6 --> 0:3:35,34
You've been acting in Iranian
cinema for a long time.


92
0:3:35,34 --> 0:3:56,2



93
0:3:56,2 --> 0:4:0,44
And you became, for us, in the
West, famous because of "Kite


94
0:4:0,44 --> 0:4:3,88
Runner." How is that different,
to be in a film


95
0:4:3,88 --> 0:4:7,18
like that versus more
traditional Iranian cinema?


96
0:4:7,18 --> 0:4:18,835



97
0:4:18,835 --> 0:4:21,41
Did "Kite Runner" get
released in Iran?


98
0:4:21,41 --> 0:4:22,5
HOMAYOUN ERSHADI: No.


99
0:4:22,5 --> 0:4:23,1
It didn't.


100
0:4:23,1 --> 0:4:28,72
But I think everybody saw
it through pirated DVD.


101
0:4:28,72 --> 0:4:29,75
SHANE SMITH: But you're
very famous Iranian


102
0:4:29,75 --> 0:4:31,5
actor outside of Iran.


103
0:4:31,5 --> 0:4:33,67
HOMAYOUN ERSHADI: Actually,
I think so.


104
0:4:33,67 --> 0:4:35,452
I am more famous over
there than here.


105
0:4:35,452 --> 0:4:36,406
SHANE SMITH: That's perfect.


106
0:4:36,406 --> 0:4:38,32
HOMAYOUN ERSHADI: Thank
you very much.


107
0:4:38,32 --> 0:4:39,73
SHANE SMITH: So we left
the film set.


108
0:4:39,73 --> 0:4:41,62
And went to an acting school,
which was actually really


109
0:4:41,62 --> 0:4:42,34
interesting.


110
0:4:42,34 --> 0:4:44,58
Because we hear that Iran
is a relatively


111
0:4:44,58 --> 0:4:45,59
conservative country.


112
0:4:45,59 --> 0:4:46,91
And they have Sharia law.


113
0:4:46,91 --> 0:4:49,7
I expected it would
be 90% of men.


114
0:4:49,7 --> 0:4:50,99
But actually when we got there,
there was just as many


115
0:4:50,99 --> 0:4:54,184
women as there were man.


116
0:4:54,184 --> 0:4:56,9
We were so surprised at this, in
fact, that we want to meet


117
0:4:56,9 --> 0:4:59,5
Fereshteh Taerpour, who was
one of the first women


118
0:4:59,5 --> 0:5:0,32
producers in Iran.


119
0:5:0,32 --> 0:5:3,6
We wanted to ask her, what is
it like to be a woman in the


120
0:5:3,6 --> 0:5:5,514
Iranian film industry.


121
0:5:5,514 --> 0:5:5,906
FERESHTEH TAERPOUR: Before


122
0:5:5,906 --> 0:5:7,92
revolution we had only actress.


123
0:5:7,92 --> 0:5:11,5
We didn't have any female
director, female producer,


124
0:5:11,5 --> 0:5:13,34
female art designer.


125
0:5:13,34 --> 0:5:16,16
But after revolution, it
completely changed.


126
0:5:16,16 --> 0:5:19,86
It found a cultural meaning,
working in


127
0:5:19,86 --> 0:5:21,18
the field of cinema.


128
0:5:21,18 --> 0:5:25,34
And it was a good prestige for
people to work in this field.


129
0:5:25,34 --> 0:5:28,74
But the other thing I want to
tell you as a secret, that if


130
0:5:28,74 --> 0:5:32,77
you stay here longer, you
will realize that women


131
0:5:32,77 --> 0:5:34,36
here are not weak.


132
0:5:34,36 --> 0:5:39,29
And even sometimes, I am
more powerful than men.


133
0:5:39,29 --> 0:5:43,2
Because the government doesn't
want to be in the position


134
0:5:43,2 --> 0:5:45,93
that everyone say, OK, you don't
pay attention to women.


135
0:5:45,93 --> 0:5:48,875
In that case, they will at least
pretend to respect me


136
0:5:48,875 --> 0:5:52,26
more than men.


137
0:5:52,26 --> 0:5:54,6
SHANE SMITH: After that, the
next thing we wanted to do was


138
0:5:54,6 --> 0:5:57,32
go buy some Iranian movies.


139
0:5:57,32 --> 0:6:0,96
Here we have "The Mothman
Prophecies," maybe the worst


140
0:6:0,96 --> 0:6:2,0
movie ever made.


141
0:6:2,0 --> 0:6:4,63
We have "Escape Velocity,"
never heard of it.


142
0:6:4,63 --> 0:6:9,16
We've got some good classics
here, Laurel and Hardy.


143
0:6:9,16 --> 0:6:12,8
This is "Walking Tall 2." And
next to that we have the


144
0:6:12,8 --> 0:6:16,32
Ayatollah, I guess,
giving a speech.


145
0:6:16,32 --> 0:6:18,96
What's interesting is that
even though they're only


146
0:6:18,96 --> 0:6:21,63
allowed three or four American
films a year, and you don't


147
0:6:21,63 --> 0:6:24,5
see a lot of Western music on
the shelves, all the kids we


148
0:6:24,5 --> 0:6:27,29
talked to knew every American
blockbuster.


149
0:6:27,29 --> 0:6:29,18
There's so many bootlegs
out there.


150
0:6:29,18 --> 0:6:31,33
And something like 44%
of the households


151
0:6:31,33 --> 0:6:32,87
in Iran have satellite.


152
0:6:32,87 --> 0:6:34,61
Half of Tehran has
family in London.


153
0:6:34,61 --> 0:6:36,46
The other half as
family in LA.


154
0:6:36,46 --> 0:6:38,17
And they know everything
about the latest


155
0:6:38,17 --> 0:6:39,71
music, the latest styles--


156
0:6:39,71 --> 0:6:41,38
they knew everything.


157
0:6:41,38 --> 0:6:43,73
So when we were in the shop, we
noticed that, like 20 DVDs


158
0:6:43,73 --> 0:6:45,18
had this one woman
on the cover--


159
0:6:45,18 --> 0:6:46,63
Mahnaz Afshar.


160
0:6:46,63 --> 0:6:47,31
And we said, wow.


161
0:6:47,31 --> 0:6:48,6
She must be really big star.


162
0:6:48,6 --> 0:6:49,61
She's in like every movie.


163
0:6:49,61 --> 0:6:52,34
And they said oh, do you
want to meet her?


164
0:6:52,34 --> 0:6:53,8
So they called her up.


165
0:6:53,8 --> 0:6:55,295
And she was actually having
a jewelry show that night.


166
0:6:55,295 --> 0:7:0,525
And so she invites us to come up
and check out her jewelry.


167
0:7:0,525 --> 0:7:3,495
We're outside of Tehran
somewhere in a very rich


168
0:7:3,495 --> 0:7:5,475
suburb with one of the
biggest stars.


169
0:7:5,475 --> 0:7:7,95
She's like the Kate
Winslet of Iran.


170
0:7:7,95 --> 0:7:10,92
And a bunch of her friends
just arrived.


171
0:7:10,92 --> 0:7:18,345
And it's the upper crust, elite,
sexy, hair dyed, boots


172
0:7:18,345 --> 0:7:22,305
out Tehran, which we haven't
seen much of at all.


173
0:7:22,305 --> 0:7:25,77
We've seen boots
in, full hijab.


174
0:7:25,77 --> 0:7:27,74
It's interesting to see.


175
0:7:27,74 --> 0:7:29,57
How is it to be a big
celebrity in Iran?


176
0:7:29,57 --> 0:7:31,23
Can you go shopping?


177
0:7:31,23 --> 0:7:34,18
Can you go out on the street?


178
0:7:34,18 --> 0:7:36,6
MAHNAZ AFSHAR: Yes,
because I like.


179
0:7:36,6 --> 0:7:38,542
And I have a problem.


180
0:7:38,542 --> 0:7:39,94
But I like it.


181
0:7:39,94 --> 0:7:40,675
SHANE SMITH: You like
the problem?


182
0:7:40,675 --> 0:7:41,98
MAHNAZ AFSHAR: Yeah.


183
0:7:41,98 --> 0:7:43,27
SHANE SMITH: And what
is the problem?


184
0:7:43,27 --> 0:7:44,51
Too many people come to you?


185
0:7:44,51 --> 0:7:44,87
MAHNAZ AFSHAR: Too
many people.


186
0:7:44,87 --> 0:7:47,28
For sign, for picture.


187
0:7:47,28 --> 0:7:48,3
Photograph, yeah.


188
0:7:48,3 --> 0:7:51,54
SHANE SMITH: And here in Iran,
is it the same as Europe or


189
0:7:51,54 --> 0:7:55,47
America that celebrities are
always in the newspapers?


190
0:7:55,47 --> 0:7:57,41
They're looking at your life?


191
0:7:57,41 --> 0:7:59,98
MAHNAZ AFSHAR: No, not Iran.


192
0:7:59,98 --> 0:8:5,93
Because in Iran, privacy
is very important.


193
0:8:5,93 --> 0:8:7,31
SHANE SMITH: So they
don't go through


194
0:8:7,31 --> 0:8:9,358
her garbage, or anything?


195
0:8:9,358 --> 0:8:10,29
No.


196
0:8:10,29 --> 0:8:12,37
So you can be private only
when you go outside.


197
0:8:12,37 --> 0:8:12,76
MAHNAZ AFSHAR: Yes.


198
0:8:12,76 --> 0:8:14,36
SHANE SMITH: OK, thank
you very much.


199
0:8:14,36 --> 0:8:14,68
Merci.


200
0:8:14,68 --> 0:8:15,44
MAHNAZ AFSHAR: Thank you.


201
0:8:15,44 --> 0:8:15,73
Nice to meet you.


202
0:8:15,73 --> 0:8:16,658
SHANE SMITH: Oh, I don't
know if I'm allowed to.


203
0:8:16,658 --> 0:8:19,91
MAHNAZ AFSHAR: No problem.


204
0:8:19,91 --> 0:8:22,5
SHANE SMITH: So after the
jewelry show we had to hurry.


205
0:8:22,5 --> 0:8:25,74
Because we were late to crash
dinner with the jury from the


206
0:8:25,74 --> 0:8:27,775
International Urban
Film Festival.


207
0:8:27,775 --> 0:8:30,745
Tomorrow night's the last
night, the grand gala.


208
0:8:30,745 --> 0:8:32,725
So tonight all the directors
are here.


209
0:8:32,725 --> 0:8:34,21
All the writers are here.


210
0:8:34,21 --> 0:8:36,685
And the jury is here to
talk about the films.


211
0:8:36,685 --> 0:8:40,15



212
0:8:40,15 --> 0:8:40,645
Nice to meet you.


213
0:8:40,645 --> 0:8:41,635
Thank you for having us.


214
0:8:41,635 --> 0:8:42,885
It's very nice.


215
0:8:42,885 --> 0:9:7,375



216
0:9:7,375 --> 0:9:11,266
They just told me that Guy
Maddin is going to win for


217
0:9:11,266 --> 0:9:14,211
Best Documentary, even though
it's not a documentary.


218
0:9:14,211 --> 0:9:17,2
And that because I'm Canadian,
they want me to go accept the


219
0:9:17,2 --> 0:9:22,9
award at the film festival.


220
0:9:22,9 --> 0:9:25,0
Perfect.

0:9:25,0 --> 0:9:29,2
