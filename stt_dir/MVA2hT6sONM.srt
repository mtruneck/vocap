1
0:0:1,31 --> 0:0:4,87
MORNING. LAST TIME WHEN WE ENDED THE LECTURE
WE


2
0:0:4,87 --> 0:0:7,779
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TWO MOST RECENT DISCOVERED


3
0:0:7,779 --> 0:0:10,99
PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS AND WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE


4
0:0:10,99 --> 0:0:19,24
AUXINS AND THE GIBBERELLINS. AND WHAT I WOULD
LIKE TO


5
0:0:19,24 --> 0:0:22,91
DO TODAY IS TO CONTINUE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOME OF


6
0:0:22,91 --> 0:0:25,74
THE GROWTH REGULATORS AND TO SHOW YOU HOW
MANY OF


7
0:0:25,74 --> 0:0:28,109
THESE GROWTH REGULATORS, IN FACT, ALL OF THEM
IN ONE


8
0:0:28,109 --> 0:0:31,96
WAY OR ANOTHER IMPACT ON MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES
OF


9
0:0:31,96 --> 0:0:34,3
YOUR LIFE HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH THE FOODS
THAT YOU


10
0:0:34,3 --> 0:0:37,77
EAT. AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE AUXINS AND


11
0:0:37,77 --> 0:0:42,9
GIBBERELLINS IN THE EARLY 1950'S AND A LITTLE
BIT


12
0:0:42,9 --> 0:0:44,6
EARLIER, PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT THERE MUST BE
OTHER


13
0:0:44,6 --> 0:0:47,81
PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS THAT WERE OUT THERE.
AND SO


14
0:0:47,81 --> 0:0:51,1
THERE WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THAT
WAS PUT


15
0:0:51,1 --> 0:0:53,89
FORWARD INTO TRYING TO FIND OTHER GROWTH REGULATORS.


16
0:0:53,89 --> 0:0:57,24
OTHER COMPOUNDS WHICH IN VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS
WOULD


17
0:0:57,24 --> 0:1:0,89
EFFECT PROFOUNDLY GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN
PLANTS.


18
0:1:0,89 --> 0:1:3,65
THE QUESTION WAS, HOW WOULD YOU FIND THESE.
DON'T


19
0:1:3,65 --> 0:1:5,969
 FORGET THAT AT THOSE TIMES WE DIDN'T HAVE,
THESE WERE


20
0:1:5,969 --> 0:1:9,14
IN THE 1950'S, WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SENSE THAT
CHEMICAL


21
0:1:9,14 --> 0:1:12,67
ANALYSIS THAT WE HAVE TODAY. SO, PEOPLE HAD
TO RESORT


22
0:1:12,67 --> 0:1:16,34
TO OTHER SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FIND
OR TO BE


23
0:1:16,34 --> 0:1:18,77
ABLE TO DETECT THESE OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT
WERE


24
0:1:18,77 --> 0:1:22,359
PROBABLY PRESENT IN VERY, VERY LOW AMOUNTS.
AND, ONE


25
0:1:22,359 --> 0:1:24,99
OF THE WAYS THEY DID IT, WILL BE ILLUSTRATED
IN THIS


26
0:1:24,99 --> 0:1:28,299
FIRST SORT OF PORTION OF THE LECTURE. I WANT
TO TALK


27
0:1:28,299 --> 0:1:30,179
TO YOU ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT WAS DEVELOPED
TO HELP


28
0:1:30,179 --> 0:1:33,579
PEOPLE DETECTOR TO FIND NEW GROWTH REGULATORS.
AND


29
0:1:33,579 --> 0:1:37,549
THIS SYSTEM DEPENDS UPON THE FACT THAT IF
WE MAKE A


30
0:1:37,549 --> 0:1:44,39
CROSS SECTION OF THE STEM, IN THE CENTER OF
THE STEM


31
0:1:44,39 --> 0:1:49,139
IS THE PITH. THESE PITH ARE UNDIFFERENTIATED


32
0:1:49,139 --> 0:1:57,35
PARENCHYMA CELLS WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN
BEFORE


33
0:1:57,35 --> 0:2:1,17
WHEN WE TALKED THE STEM. NOT ONLY ARE THESE
CELLS


34
0:2:1,17 --> 0:2:4,149
UNDIFFERENTIATED PARENCHYMA CELLS, BUT BECAUSE
THEY


35
0:2:4,149 --> 0:2:8,319
ARE LOCATED IN THE CENTER, THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY
FREE


36
0:2:8,319 --> 0:2:11,219
OF ANY MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION AND THEY ARE
SAID TO BE


37
0:2:11,219 --> 0:2:16,59
 ASEPTIC. THEY ARE FREE OF ANY MICROBIAL


38
0:2:16,59 --> 0:2:21,349
CONTAMINATION. AND SO WHAT WAS DONE WAS TO
USE THESE


39
0:2:21,349 --> 0:2:24,709
CELLS IN A TECHNIQUE WHICH WAS KNOWN AS TISSUE


40
0:2:24,709 --> 0:2:28,81
CULTURE. SOME OF YOU HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE
OR HAVE


41
0:2:28,81 --> 0:2:32,14
READ SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. LET'S TALK ABOUT
HOW THEY


42
0:2:32,14 --> 0:2:37,93
DID THIS. WE HAD AN ERLENMEYER FLASK, ERLENMEYER


43
0:2:37,93 --> 0:2:44,62
FLASK. SO HERE WE HAVE A FLASK. AND WE HAVE
A MEDIUM


44
0:2:44,62 --> 0:2:47,799
HERE WHATEVER IT COULD BE, SOME KIND OF CULTURE


45
0:2:47,799 --> 0:2:52,319
MEDIUM. AND, INTO THIS ERLENMEYER FLASK WE
PUT THE


46
0:2:52,319 --> 0:2:59,409
PITH. THE PITH TISSUE. AND THEN WHAT THESE
WORKERS


47
0:2:59,409 --> 0:3:5,14
DID WAS THEY BEGAN TO TAKE PLANTS AND TO EXTRACT
THEM,


48
0:3:5,14 --> 0:3:7,93
TO FRACTIONATE THEM, TO BREAK THEM DOWN IN
TO SMALLER


49
0:3:7,93 --> 0:3:14,489
AND SMALLER FRACTIONS. AND THEN TO INCLUDE
THE


50
0:3:14,489 --> 0:3:22,4
FRACTIONS INTO THE CULTURE MEDIUM. AND THEN
TO SEE


51
0:3:22,4 --> 0:3:25,709
WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT WAS THE RESULT. WHAT KIND
OF


52
0:3:25,709 --> 0:3:30,379
PHENOMENOLOGY DID THE PARENCHYMA CELLS, THE
PITH CELLS


53
0:3:30,379 --> 0:3:33,29
BEGIN TO SHOW. AND COMING FROM THIS WORK WAS
THE


54
0:3:33,29 --> 0:3:43,17
DISCOVERY OF THE THIRD GROUP OF PLANT GROWTH
 REGULATORS WHICH STIMULATED CELL DIVISION.


55
0:3:43,17 --> 0:3:43,609
A GROUP OF


56
0:3:43,609 --> 0:3:46,219
GROWTH REGULATORS WHICH IN VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS


57
0:3:46,219 --> 0:3:51,25
STIMULATED CELL DIVISION. SO, IF YOU LOOKED
INSIDE OF


58
0:3:51,25 --> 0:3:54,739
THIS FLASK, WHICH ORIGINALLY HAD THE PARENCHYMA
CELLS


59
0:3:54,739 --> 0:4:6,579
IN IT, WE NOW HAD A LARGE UNDIFFERENTIATED
MASS OF


60
0:4:6,579 --> 0:4:13,6
CELLS. AND, BIOLOGISTS HAD TO GIVE A NAME
TO THIS


61
0:4:13,6 --> 0:4:15,9
LARGE UNDIFFERENTIATED MASS OF CELLS, SO THEY
CALL IT


62
0:4:15,9 --> 0:4:21,16
A CALLUS, CALLUS. YOU WILL SEE IT REFERRED
TO THIS


63
0:4:21,16 --> 0:4:23,75
WAY IN YOUR TEXT BOOK. A LARGE UNDIFFERENTIATED
MASS


64
0:4:23,75 --> 0:4:27,97
OF CELLS. WHEN THEY THEN LOOKED TO SEE WHAT
WAS IN


65
0:4:27,97 --> 0:4:31,35
THIS FRACTION THAT WAS CAUSING THESE CELLS
TO DIVIDE


66
0:4:31,35 --> 0:4:36,25
VERY RAPIDLY, THEY DISCOVERED A GROUP OF COMPOUNDS


67
0:4:36,25 --> 0:4:42,75
WHICH WE COLLECTIVELY CALL TODAY, CYTOKININS.
THAT


68
0:4:42,75 --> 0:4:46,87
IS, THEY STIMULATE CELL DIVISION, CYTOKINESES
WHICH IS


69
0:4:46,87 --> 0:4:49,93
WHERE THE TERM CYTOKININS COMES FROM. CYTOKINESES.


70
0:4:49,93 --> 0:4:56,35
THEY STIMULATE CELL DIVISION. CYTOKININS ARE
PROBABLY


71
0:4:56,35 --> 0:4:58,63
OF THE GROWTH REGULATORS WE ARE GOING TO TALK
ABOUT,


72
0:4:58,63 --> 0:5:2,9
THE ONES WHICH WE DON'T HAVE MUCH EVIDENCE
FOR THEIR


73
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:6,28
 INVOLVEMENT IN OUR DAILY ACTIVITIES. BUT,
THEY HAVE


74
0:5:6,28 --> 0:5:8,919
VERY PROFOUND EFFECTS ON GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.
SO,


75
0:5:8,919 --> 0:5:15,77
LET'S LIST SOME OF THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE


76
0:5:15,77 --> 0:5:23,8
CYTOKININS. THE FIRST CHARACTERISTIC WAS THE
BASIS OF


77
0:5:23,8 --> 0:5:30,639
THEIR DISCOVERY. THEY STIMULATE CELL DIVISION.
THE


78
0:5:30,639 --> 0:5:33,94
SECOND CHARACTERISTIC IS A VERY INTERESTING
ONE, THEY


79
0:5:33,94 --> 0:5:42,259
DELAY SENESCENCE.


80
0:5:42,259 --> 0:5:46,449
SENESCENCE OR DEATH. AND THIS IS


81
0:5:46,449 --> 0:5:49,539
AN INTERESTING TOPIC, ONE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN
STUDIED


82
0:5:49,539 --> 0:5:53,28
TOO MUCH, BUT IS OBVIOUSLY ONE WHICH MIGHT
HAVE A LOT


83
0:5:53,28 --> 0:5:59,68
OF PRACTICAL VALUE. A THIRD SORT OF THING
THAT


84
0:5:59,68 --> 0:6:11,39
CYTOKININS DO IS IN, LET'S SAY, IN COMBINATION
WITH


85
0:6:11,39 --> 0:6:19,11
OTHER GROWTH REGULATORS, THEY CAN AFFECT PLANT


86
0:6:19,11 --> 0:6:34,919
DEVELOPMENT.


87
0:6:34,919 --> 0:6:39,25
AND LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THEY DO THIS


88
0:6:39,25 --> 0:6:41,949
AND I WANT TO FOCUS ON ONE OF THE GROWTH REGULATORS


89
0:6:41,949 --> 0:6:45,169
THAT THEY WORK IN COMBINATION WITH. ONE THAT
YOU HAVE


90
0:6:45,169 --> 0:6:47,84
SEEN BEFORE, ALTHOUGH, THIS IS NOT THE ONLY
ONE IN


91
0:6:47,84 --> 0:6:51,659
WHICH THEY HAVE EFFECTS. AND THIS COMBINATION
HAS TO


92
0:6:51,659 --> 0:7:3,24
DO WITH AUXIN AND CYTOKININS. IF IN THIS TISSUE
 CULTURE FLASK THAT WE HAVE DRAWN BEFORE,


93
0:7:3,24 --> 0:7:3,71
IF IN THIS


94
0:7:3,71 --> 0:7:6,659
TISSUE CULTURE FLASK THAT WE DREW BEFORE,
WE INCLUDE


95
0:7:6,659 --> 0:7:14,639
BOTH AUXINS AND CYTOKININS. IN THE MEDIUM
WE CAN


96
0:7:14,639 --> 0:7:19,37
PROFOUNDLY EFFECT THE CALLUS TISSUE AND IN
ORDER TO


97
0:7:19,37 --> 0:7:22,479
SUMMARIZE A LARGE NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS I
AM GOING TO


98
0:7:22,479 --> 0:7:26,61
MAKE THIS GRAPH FOR YOU OVER HERE. ON THIS
GRAPH WE


99
0:7:26,61 --> 0:7:32,81
ARE GOING TO HAVE AUXIN ON THE Y AXIS AND
THIS WOULD


100
0:7:32,81 --> 0:7:37,18
BE INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF AUXIN WITH
ZERO DOWN


101
0:7:37,18 --> 0:7:40,289
AT THE BOTTOM. EVERYBODY CLEAR ABOUT THAT?
AND ON


102
0:7:40,289 --> 0:7:45,97
THE X AXIS WE ARE GOING TO PUT CYTOKININ WITH


103
0:7:45,97 --> 0:7:53,389
INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS IN THIS DIRECTION.
SO, IF


104
0:7:53,389 --> 0:7:56,509
THE FLASK CONTAINED NO AUXIN OR NO CYTOKININ
IT WOULD


105
0:7:56,509 --> 0:8:0,61
BE ZERO. AND IF IT HAD A LOT OF AUXIN BUT
A LOW LEVEL


106
0:8:0,61 --> 0:8:4,5
OF CYTOKININ IT WOULD HAVE A HIGH RATIO OF
AUXIN TO


107
0:8:4,5 --> 0:8:8,36
CYTOKININ OR IF IT HAD A LOT OF CYTOKININ
BUT LOW


108
0:8:8,36 --> 0:8:10,31
LEVELS OF AUXIN, IT WOULD HAVE A HIGH RATIO
OF


109
0:8:10,31 --> 0:8:13,58
CYTOKININ TO AUXIN. THE FIRST THING THAT WAS
FOUND IS


110
0:8:13,58 --> 0:8:18,33
IF YOU INCLUDED IN THIS MEDIUM, AUXIN AND
CYTOKININ IN


111
0:8:18,33 --> 0:8:21,65
 ABOUT THE SAME RATIO. WHAT YOU FOUND SO
THAT THEY ARE


112
0:8:21,65 --> 0:8:24,919
ABOUT THE SAME RATIO 1 TO 1. WHAT YOU FOUND
IS THAT


113
0:8:24,919 --> 0:8:27,5
THE CALLUS REMAINED UNDIFFERENTIATED.


114
0:8:27,5 --> 0:8:36,719
UNDIFFERENTIATED CALLUS. ON THE OTHER HAND,
IF THE


115
0:8:36,719 --> 0:8:40,79
RATIO OF THE AUXIN AND THE CYTOKININ IN THE
FLASK, I


116
0:8:40,79 --> 0:8:43,11
WILL SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES OF THESE IN A
MOMENT, WAS


117
0:8:43,11 --> 0:8:47,0
FAVORING AUXIN SO THAT IS, YOU HAD A HIGH
AMOUNT OF


118
0:8:47,0 --> 0:8:51,5
AUXIN RELATIVE TO A LOW AMOUNT OF CYTOKININ,
THE


119
0:8:51,5 --> 0:8:59,36
CALLUS FORMED ROOTS. CALLUS FORMED ROOTS.
AND, IF


120
0:8:59,36 --> 0:9:3,23
YOU HAD A HIGH LEVEL OF CYTOKININ, THAT IS
SOME PLACE


121
0:9:3,23 --> 0:9:8,0
OVER HERE AND A LOW LEVEL OF AUXIN AND YOU
PUT THAT IN


122
0:9:8,0 --> 0:9:18,209
TO THE CULTURE MEDIUM THE CALLUS FORMED SHOOTS.
SO


123
0:9:18,209 --> 0:9:21,79
SIMPLY BY VARYING THE RATIO ON THE AMOUNTS
AS WELL,


124
0:9:21,79 --> 0:9:24,93
ONE COULD EFFECT IN A VERY PROFOUND WAY THE


125
0:9:24,93 --> 0:9:28,0
DEVELOPMENT OF THESE CALLUS CELLS SETTING
THEM OFF ON


126
0:9:28,0 --> 0:9:30,31
A COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT WHICH WAS VERY DIFFERENT,


127
0:9:30,31 --> 0:9:34,339
EITHER SHOOTS OR ROOTS OR REMAINING THE SAME.
WE


128
0:9:34,339 --> 0:9:36,88
DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS PROCESS. IT IS
A VERY


129
0:9:36,88 --> 0:9:40,64
 INTRIGUING PROCESS, BUT VERY DIFFICULT TO
STUDY AND WE


130
0:9:40,64 --> 0:9:43,94
REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS RATIO IS
EFFECTING


131
0:9:43,94 --> 0:9:50,74
THE DIFFERENTIATION. FOURTH EFFECT OF CYTOKININS
IS


132
0:9:50,74 --> 0:9:59,62
THAT THEY OVERCOME APICAL DOMINANCE.


133
0:9:59,62 --> 0:10:0,17
WHICH AS WE SAID


134
0:10:0,17 --> 0:10:7,36
WAS DUE TO AUXIN. SO, LET'S LOOK AT THAT STATEMENT


135
0:10:7,36 --> 0:10:13,74
OVER HERE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, WE HAVE
A SHOOT


136
0:10:13,74 --> 0:10:22,76
WITH STRONG APICAL DOMINANCE.


137
0:10:22,76 --> 0:10:24,269
THAT MEANS THAT, WE


138
0:10:24,269 --> 0:10:27,82
WILL JUST MAKE ONE HERE, THAT THE AXILLARY
BUDS DON'T


139
0:10:27,82 --> 0:10:39,91
GROW OUT.


140
0:10:39,91 --> 0:10:49,76
IF ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU NOW ADD CYTOKININ


141
0:10:49,76 --> 0:10:52,41
AND USUALLY YOU CAN TAKE A DROP OF LIQUID
AND JUST PUT


142
0:10:52,41 --> 0:10:55,66
A DROP OF LIQUID ON TOP OF THAT AXILLARY BUD,
IF YOU


143
0:10:55,66 --> 0:11:1,19
ADD CYTOKININ TO THIS AND YOU WAIT FOR SOME
TIME, WHAT


144
0:11:1,19 --> 0:11:4,589
YOU FIND, HERE ARE THE LEAVES, IS THAT THE
AXILLARY


145
0:11:4,589 --> 0:11:14,17
BUD GROWS OUT.


146
0:11:14,17 --> 0:11:17,22
GROWS OUT. WE DON'T KNOW HOW THIS


147
0:11:17,22 --> 0:11:21,16
HAPPENS, BUT WE KNOW THAT THE CYTOKININ IS
ABLE TO


148
0:11:21,16 --> 0:11:24,51
OVERCOME THAT STRONG REPRESSION OF AXILLARY
BUD OUT


149
0:11:24,51 --> 0:11:28,579
GROWTH BY SOME METHOD THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA
ABOUT.


150
0:11:28,579 --> 0:11:32,589
HOWEVER, THIS IS INSTRUCTIVE BECAUSE THERE
ARE SOME


151
0:11:32,589 --> 0:11:35,92
 PLANT DISEASES. ONE OF WHICH YOU MAY BE
FAMILIAR


152
0:11:35,92 --> 0:11:42,1
WITH. KNOWN AS WITCH'S BROOM, IN WHICH, IF
YOU LOOK


153
0:11:42,1 --> 0:11:46,56
AT THE DISEASE THE PLANT HAS ON THE BRANCH,
ALL OF THE


154
0:11:46,56 --> 0:11:49,88
AXILLARY BUDS ARE RELEASED. ALL THE AXILLARY
BUDS


155
0:11:49,88 --> 0:11:57,389
GROW OUT.


156
0:11:57,389 --> 0:11:59,18
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE BROOM OF A WITCH.


157
0:11:59,18 --> 0:12:2,899
SO THIS IS WHY IT IS CALLED WITCH'S BROOM.
NOW, HOW


158
0:12:2,899 --> 0:12:6,35
DOES THIS DISEASE CAUSE THESE AXILLARY BUDS
TO GROW


159
0:12:6,35 --> 0:12:11,26
OUT? ESSENTIALLY THIS DISEASE, WHICH IS CAUSED
BY


160
0:12:11,26 --> 0:12:23,8
A BACTERIUM, EITHER THE BACTERIUM PRODUCES
CYTOKININ


161
0:12:23,8 --> 0:12:36,85
OR CAUSES THE PLANT TO PRODUCE MORE CYTOKININ.


162
0:12:36,85 --> 0:12:40,269
THE NET EFFECT IS THAT THERE IS A LARGE AMOUNT


163
0:12:40,269 --> 0:12:42,88
OF CYTOKININ WHERE THE BACTERIUM HAS INFECTED
THE


164
0:12:42,88 --> 0:12:46,589
PLANT AND THIS RESULTS IN A CHANGE IN THE
RATIO OF


165
0:12:46,589 --> 0:12:49,73
CYTOKININ TO AUXIN AND THE BUDS ALL GROW OUT
MAKING


166
0:12:49,73 --> 0:12:52,29
THIS STRUCTURE. AND MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN
THIS


167
0:12:52,29 --> 0:12:54,4
BEFORE AND NOT REALIZED THAT IT IS CAUSED
BY


168
0:12:54,4 --> 0:12:57,1
A DISEASE. NOW, WE SAID THAT CYTOKININS ALSO


169
0:12:57,1 --> 0:13:1,22
STIMULATE CELL DIVISION AND THIS WAS TAKEN
UP BY THE


170
0:13:1,22 --> 0:13:3,899
 MEDICAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY WERE INTERESTED
BECAUSE


171
0:13:3,899 --> 0:13:7,269
YOU CAN ALSO BACTERIAL DISEASES WHICH INFECT
PLANTS.


172
0:13:7,269 --> 0:13:10,42
CYTOKININS AGAIN ARE EITHER PRODUCED BY THE
BACTERIUM


173
0:13:10,42 --> 0:13:13,279
OR THE PLANT MAKES MORE BACTERIUM, AND THIS
RESULTS IN


174
0:13:13,279 --> 0:13:18,829
THE PRODUCTION OF TUMORS. TUMORS. AND THESE
TUMORS


175
0:13:18,829 --> 0:13:24,51
MIMIC WHAT ONE MIGHT FIND IN A MICROBIAL SYSTEM
IN


176
0:13:24,51 --> 0:13:28,779
WHICH WE HAVE CANCER GROWING AND SO MANY PEOPLE
WERE


177
0:13:28,779 --> 0:13:31,72
STUDYING CYTOKININS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW
OF TRYING


178
0:13:31,72 --> 0:13:35,389
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS MIGHT BE A MODEL SYSTEM
FOR


179
0:13:35,389 --> 0:13:39,149
HELPING US TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT CANCER.


180
0:13:39,149 --> 0:13:41,18
THESE FIRST SLIDES I WANT TO SHOW YOU NOW
ARE


181
0:13:41,18 --> 0:13:45,12
GOING TO BE ONES THAT SHOW VARIOUS ASPECTS
OF


182
0:13:45,12 --> 0:13:52,829
CYTOKININS. HERE IS A TISSUE CULTURE SYSTEM
IN WHICH


183
0:13:52,829 --> 0:13:55,699
WE HAVE PITH CELLS WHICH HAVE BEEN PLACED
ON TO AN


184
0:13:55,699 --> 0:13:59,1
AGAR MEDIUM. THIS IS ASEPTIC. AND THEN IF
WE ADD


185
0:13:59,1 --> 0:14:1,279
VARIOUS THINGS TO THE AGAR MEDIUM, AND IN
THIS CASE,


186
0:14:1,279 --> 0:14:4,36
IF WE ADD CYTOKININS TO THE AGAR MEDIUM WE
CAN


187
0:14:4,36 --> 0:14:7,37
STIMULATE THE PITH CELLS TO START DIVIDING
TO ENLARGE


188
0:14:7,37 --> 0:14:10,57
 TO MAKE THIS UNDIFFERENTIATED MASS OF CELLS
WHICH IS


189
0:14:10,57 --> 0:14:13,87
KNOWN AS CALLUS. IF IN THE CULTURE MEDIUM
YOU INCLUDE


190
0:14:13,87 --> 0:14:17,88
A HIGH LEVEL OF CYTOKININ TO AUXIN, YOU CAN
CAUSE THE


191
0:14:17,88 --> 0:14:21,32
PITH CELLS TO FORM SHOOTS, THIS IS A TOBACCO
PLANT IN


192
0:14:21,32 --> 0:14:25,209
CULTURE. AND IF YOU NOW CHANGE THE RATIO SO
THAT YOU


193
0:14:25,209 --> 0:14:29,16
HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF AUXINS TO CYTOKININS YOU
CAN CAUSE


194
0:14:29,16 --> 0:14:32,5
THE PITH CELLS TO FORM ROOTS. A VERY PROFOUND


195
0:14:32,5 --> 0:14:35,82
DIFFERENCE. AND YOU CAN MAKE KIND OF A SUMMARY
CHART


196
0:14:35,82 --> 0:14:39,11
WHERE THIS ONE THEY HAVE THE AUXIN ON THE
TOP AND THE


197
0:14:39,11 --> 0:14:41,16
CYTOKININ ON THE SIDE. BUT THE WHOLE POINT
IS THAT


198
0:14:41,16 --> 0:14:44,79
HIGH LEVELS OF CYTOKININ, LOW LEVELS OF AUXIN
YOU GET


199
0:14:44,79 --> 0:14:47,529
SHOOTS. HIGH LEVELS OF AUXIN LOW LEVELS CYTOKININ
YOU


200
0:14:47,529 --> 0:14:49,42
GET ROOTS AND IN BETWEEN YOU HAVE THIS


201
0:14:49,42 --> 0:14:53,23
UNDIFFERENTIATED PHASE. HERE IS A PEA PLANT
NOW, THIS


202
0:14:53,23 --> 0:14:56,329
IS A CONTROL WITH THE APEX UP HERE. THE AXILLARY
BUD


203
0:14:56,329 --> 0:14:58,329
WOULD BE LOCATED HERE AND WOULD BE INHIBITED
FROM


204
0:14:58,329 --> 0:15:1,22
GROWING OUT. IF YOU ADD A DROP OF CYTOKININ
TO THAT


205
0:15:1,22 --> 0:15:4,68
AXILLARY BUD AND YOU WAIT FOR SOME TIME, YOU
OVERCOME


206
0:15:4,68 --> 0:15:7,199
 OR YOU RELEASE APICAL DOMINANCE AND YOU
CAN CAUSE IT


207
0:15:7,199 --> 0:15:10,6
TO GROW OUT. HERE IS WITCH'S BROOM, AGAIN,
WHICH SOME


208
0:15:10,6 --> 0:15:12,279
OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN. ALL OF THE AXILLARY
BUDS HAVE


209
0:15:12,279 --> 0:15:16,12
BEEN RELEASED FROM APICAL DOMINANCE DUE TO
THIS


210
0:15:16,12 --> 0:15:19,88
BACTERIUM. THERE IS A TUMOR OR A GALL. MOST
PEOPLE


211
0:15:19,88 --> 0:15:22,89
CORRECTLY CALL THIS A TUMOR. TUMORS CAN GET
TO BE


212
0:15:22,89 --> 0:15:24,509
QUITE LARGE. FOR THOSE OF YOU AGAIN WHO HAVE
BEEN UP


213
0:15:24,509 --> 0:15:27,88
TO DAVIS LONG THE QUAD, SOME OF THE TREES
WHICH LINE


214
0:15:27,88 --> 0:15:30,889
THE QUAD HAVE THESE LARGE TUMORS ON THEM.
THEY ARE


215
0:15:30,889 --> 0:15:34,279
LIKELY, ALTHOUGH NOT PROVEN, TO BE A RESULT
OF AN


216
0:15:34,279 --> 0:15:37,24
INFECTION FROM A BACTERIUM WHICH AGAIN IS
EITHER


217
0:15:37,24 --> 0:15:40,1
ITSELF MAKES CYTOKININ OR IT IS CAUSING THE
TREES


218
0:15:40,1 --> 0:15:44,49
NATURAL SYSTEM TO BEGIN TO MAKE CYTOKININ.
OKAY, SO


219
0:15:44,49 --> 0:15:47,55
THESE ARE THE CYTOKININS. THEY ARE OF THE
GROWTH


220
0:15:47,55 --> 0:15:49,93
REGULATORS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT. THE ONES
WHICH ARE


221
0:15:49,93 --> 0:15:53,279
MOST DIFFICULT TO STUDY. THEY ARE ONES WHICH
HAVE NOT


222
0:15:53,279 --> 0:15:56,74
HAD A LOT OF WORK RECENTLY DONE ON THEM, BUT
IT IS A


223
0:15:56,74 --> 0:15:59,4
FIELD WHICH IS RIPE FOR STUDY BECAUSE THERE
IS SO MANY


224
0:15:59,4 --> 0:16:2,779
 PROFOUND EFFECTS THAT THESE REGULATORS CONTROL.
SO


225
0:16:2,779 --> 0:16:5,819
FAR WE HAVE CONSIDERED 3 GROWTH REGULATORS.
AUXINS,


226
0:16:5,819 --> 0:16:9,449
GIBBERELLINS AND CYTOKININS. EACH OF THESE
GROWTH


227
0:16:9,449 --> 0:16:11,85
REGULATORS ARE TRANSPORTED THROUGHOUT THE
PLANT VIA


228
0:16:11,85 --> 0:16:14,209
THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. THE PLANT MAY MAKE THEM
IN


229
0:16:14,209 --> 0:16:16,88
SOMEPLACE AND MAY MOVE THEM SOMEPLACE ELSE
VIA THE


230
0:16:16,88 --> 0:16:19,98
VASCULAR SYSTEM. THIS FOURTH GROWTH REGULATOR
THAT WE


231
0:16:19,98 --> 0:16:23,66
WANT TO TALK ABOUT NOW, UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS
3 IS NOT


232
0:16:23,66 --> 0:16:26,149
TRANSPORTED IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. AND THE
REASON IT


233
0:16:26,149 --> 0:16:28,459
IS NOT TRANSPORTED IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM
IS BECAUSE


234
0:16:28,459 --> 0:16:31,639
IT IS A GAS. AND IT IS DISTRIBUTED AROUND
THE PLANTS


235
0:16:31,639 --> 0:16:34,56
IN THE AIR. NOW HOW WAS THIS PARTICULAR GROWTH


236
0:16:34,56 --> 0:16:38,54
REGULATOR DISCOVERED? THE WORK WHICH BEGAN
OF THE


237
0:16:38,54 --> 0:16:41,9
DISCOVERY OF THE GROWTH REGULATORS REALLY
GOES BACK TO


238
0:16:41,9 --> 0:16:45,16
THE TIME THAT HOUSES AND ROOMS WERE FIRST
ILLUMINATED


239
0:16:45,16 --> 0:16:48,529
WITH GAS LAMPS OR HEATED WITH GAS STOVES.
PEOPLE


240
0:16:48,529 --> 0:16:52,75
NOTICED THAT IN ROOMS WHICH WERE EITHER ILLUMINATED


241
0:16:52,75 --> 0:16:57,2
WITH GAS LIGHT OR GAS OR HEATED WITH GAS,
THAT THE


242
0:16:57,2 --> 0:16:59,79
 PLANTS IN THESE ROOMS BEGAN TO SHOW SOME
SERIOUS


243
0:16:59,79 --> 0:17:5,3
EFFECTS. THE FIRST EFFECT SHOWED THAT THE
PETALS ON


244
0:17:5,3 --> 0:17:7,94
THE FLOWERS THAT WERE GROWING IN THE ROOMS
DISCOLORED.


245
0:17:7,94 --> 0:17:14,69
THE SECOND EFFECT WAS A NEW ONE THAT PEOPLE
HADN'T


246
0:17:14,69 --> 0:17:21,71
REGULARLY SEEN. THE PLANTS DISPLAYED AN UNUSUAL


247
0:17:21,71 --> 0:17:23,8
PHENOMENON, AND I WILL DRAW IT FOR YOU, BUT
I WANT TO


248
0:17:23,8 --> 0:17:29,1
GIVE YOU THE NAME, CALLED EPINASTY. WHAT DOES


249
0:17:29,1 --> 0:17:36,93
EPINASTY LOOK LIKE? IF THIS IS THE STEM AND
THESE


250
0:17:36,93 --> 0:17:43,6
ARE THE LEAVES, THESE ARE THE LEAVES, IN THE
EPINASTY


251
0:17:43,6 --> 0:17:49,34
RESPONSE WHAT WE FOUND HAPPENING WAS THAT
THE LEAVES


252
0:17:49,34 --> 0:17:56,43
BEGAN TO CURL BACK ON THEMSELVES. EPINASTY.
LEAVES


253
0:17:56,43 --> 0:18:2,3
BEGAN TO CURL BACK ON THEMSELVES. ANOTHER


254
0:18:2,3 --> 0:18:4,5
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PLANTS THAT WERE GROWING
IN THE


255
0:18:4,5 --> 0:18:7,31
ROOMS THAT WERE HEATED OR ILLUMINATED BY GAS
WAS THAT


256
0:18:7,31 --> 0:18:17,78
THE LEAVES AND THE PETALS FELL OFF OR AS BIOLOGISTS


257
0:18:17,78 --> 0:18:23,35
SAY, THEY ABSCISED. THEY FELL OFF. THEY DROPPED
TO


258
0:18:23,35 --> 0:18:25,42
THE GROUND. NOT GOOD IF YOU WANT TO HAVE PLANTS
IN


259
0:18:25,42 --> 0:18:29,29
YOUR ROOM. FURTHER STUDY OF WHY THESE LEAVES
OR


260
0:18:29,29 --> 0:18:34,73
 PETALS FELL OFF GAVE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:


261
0:18:34,73 --> 0:18:40,57
IF WE DRAW HERE A STEM. A STEM. AND HERE WE


262
0:18:40,57 --> 0:18:48,23
HAVE A PETIOLE. HERE WOULD BE THE BLADE. THE
WHOLE


263
0:18:48,23 --> 0:18:50,78
THING WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE THE LEAF. WHAT PEOPLE


264
0:18:50,78 --> 0:18:55,55
NOTICED OR WHAT INVESTIGATORS NOTICED WAS
THAT PRIOR


265
0:18:55,55 --> 0:19:3,15
TO THE LEAVES FALLING OFF, THAT A ZONE BEGAN
TO


266
0:19:3,15 --> 0:19:12,81
WEAKEN. BECAME WEAK.


267
0:19:12,81 --> 0:19:14,77
WHATEVER THIS GAS WAS DOING, IT


268
0:19:14,77 --> 0:19:18,6
WAS PROMOTING A WEAKENING OF THIS ZONE. PROBABLY


269
0:19:18,6 --> 0:19:22,7
PROMOTING SOME KIND OF ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY.
AND THE


270
0:19:22,7 --> 0:19:24,2
LEAVES THEN DROPPED AND THE PETALS DROPPED
VERY


271
0:19:24,2 --> 0:19:28,9
EASILY. BECAUSE THIS ZONE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH
THE


272
0:19:28,9 --> 0:19:31,77
FALLING OR THE ABSCISSION OF THE LEAVES AND
THE PETALS


273
0:19:31,77 --> 0:19:37,72
IT WAS CALLED THE ABSCISSION ZONE. THE ABSCISSION


274
0:19:37,72 --> 0:19:42,33
ZONE. AND THIS GAS SEEMED TO AFFECT WHAT WAS
GOING ON


275
0:19:42,33 --> 0:19:49,49
IN THE ABSCISSION ZONE. NOW, FURTHER ANALYSIS
OF THE


276
0:19:49,49 --> 0:19:52,32
GAS THEN WAS UNDERTAKEN TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT


277
0:19:52,32 --> 0:19:55,67
WAS THAT WAS CAUSING ALL OF THESE EFFECTS.
AND, FROM


278
0:19:55,67 --> 0:20:0,0
THIS WORK THE DISCOVERY WAS MADE OF THE FOURTH
PLANT


279
0:20:0,0 --> 0:20:9,98
 GROWTH REGULATOR WHICH IS KNOWN AS ETHYLENE,
WHICH IS


280
0:20:9,98 --> 0:20:16,43
A GAS. PEOPLE FOUND THAT IN THE ROOMS THAT
THEY LIVED


281
0:20:16,43 --> 0:20:21,35
IN IF THEY CONTAINED THE GAS THAT THEY USED,
CONTAINED


282
0:20:21,35 --> 0:20:26,44
ETHYLENE, THAT WE SAW ALL OF THESE EFFECTS,
EXCEPT IN


283
0:20:26,44 --> 0:20:29,95
ONE HOUSEPLANT THAT PEOPLE HAD THEY DIDN'T
SEE THE


284
0:20:29,95 --> 0:20:32,2
EFFECTS. WHEREAS, ALL OF THE OTHER PLANTS
IN THE


285
0:20:32,2 --> 0:20:34,65
ROOMS WERE LOSING THEIR LEAVES AND THE PETALS
WERE


286
0:20:34,65 --> 0:20:38,91
FALLING OFF. THIS PLANT UP HERE IN FRONT KNOWN
AS


287
0:20:38,91 --> 0:20:44,31
THE CAST IRON PLANT, SEEMED NOT TO BE EFFECTED
BY THE


288
0:20:44,31 --> 0:20:48,26
ETHYLENE, BY WHAT WAS IN THE GAS. THEREFORE,
IN


289
0:20:48,26 --> 0:20:51,21
PROPER VICTORIAN HOMES WHICH WERE HEATED AND


290
0:20:51,21 --> 0:20:54,35
ILLUMINATED BY GASLIGHT THIS WAS THE ONLY
PLANT THAT


291
0:20:54,35 --> 0:20:57,78
COULD BE FOUND. AND IF YOU PICTURES OF VICTORIANS


292
0:20:57,78 --> 0:21:0,9
HOME THAT ARE ILLUMINATED BY GASLIGHT THIS
SHOULD BE


293
0:21:0,9 --> 0:21:2,91
THE ONLY PLANT THAT SHOULD BE GROWING IN THOSE
HOUSES.


294
0:21:2,91 --> 0:21:7,1
CALLED THE CAST IRON PLANT. AND IT APPEARS
NOT TO BE


295
0:21:7,1 --> 0:21:11,41
SUSCEPTIBLE OR NOT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE
COMPOUND


296
0:21:11,41 --> 0:21:14,18
WHICH WAS ETHYLENE. ETHYLENE TURNED OUT TO
BE THEN


297
0:21:14,18 --> 0:21:17,33
 A CONTAMINANT IN THE GAS THAT PEOPLE USED
TO HEAT


298
0:21:17,33 --> 0:21:21,2
THEIR HOUSES. AND AFTER IT WAS DISCOVERED,
IT WAS


299
0:21:21,2 --> 0:21:24,81
THEN FOUND TO HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON DEVELOPMENT
AND


300
0:21:24,81 --> 0:21:28,27
WE NOW CONSIDER IT A FOURTH PLANT GROWTH REGULATOR.


301
0:21:28,27 --> 0:21:30,95
NOT ONLY IS IT A FOURTH PLANT GROWTH REGULATOR,
BUT IT


302
0:21:30,95 --> 0:21:33,3
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMERCIALLY OF ALL
OF THE


303
0:21:33,3 --> 0:21:35,82
GROWTH REGULATORS THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT
HERE. AND,


304
0:21:35,82 --> 0:21:39,4
IT IS THE ONE WHICH IMPACTS DAILY ON YOUR
LIVES. I


305
0:21:39,4 --> 0:21:40,93
WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS
THAT


306
0:21:40,93 --> 0:21:44,37
ETHYLENE DOES.


307
0:21:44,37 --> 0:21:46,37
PROBABLY, THE MAJOR ASPECT OR THE MAJOR WAY


308
0:21:46,37 --> 0:21:52,21
ETHYLENE IMPACTS ON YOUR LIFE IS THAT IT AFFECTS
OR WE


309
0:21:52,21 --> 0:22:2,23
COULD EVEN SAY STIMULATES FRUIT RIPENING.
AND


310
0:22:2,23 --> 0:22:5,5
THEREFORE, BECAUSE IT AFFECTS FRUIT RIPENING
BECAUSE


311
0:22:5,5 --> 0:22:8,15
FRUITS ARE A MAJOR PART OF OUR DIETS THIS
PARTICULAR


312
0:22:8,15 --> 0:22:13,22
SUBSTANCE GAINED A LARGE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION.
NOT


313
0:22:13,22 --> 0:22:17,64
ONLY CAN ETHYLENE AFFECT FRUIT RIPENING, BUT
IT


314
0:22:17,64 --> 0:22:21,19
AFFECTS IT IN A VERY UNUSUAL NUMBER OF WAYS.
AND ONE


315
0:22:21,19 --> 0:22:23,6
 WAY IT AFFECTS FRUIT RIPENING IS BASED ON
THE


316
0:22:23,6 --> 0:22:27,4
CHARACTERISTIC THAT ETHYLENE, WHICH I WILL
ABBREVIATE


317
0:22:27,4 --> 0:22:39,91
AS E, ETHYLENE STIMULATES ITS OWN FORMATION.
THAT IS,


318
0:22:39,91 --> 0:22:46,38
IT IS AUTOCATALYTIC.


319
0:22:46,38 --> 0:22:50,37
STIMULATES ITS OWN FORMATION.


320
0:22:50,37 --> 0:22:56,62
IF YOU HAVE A FRUIT WHICH IS OVER RIPE, AND
IS


321
0:22:56,62 --> 0:23:3,26
PRODUCING ETHYLENE, IF YOU HAVE A FRUIT THAT
IS


322
0:23:3,26 --> 0:23:8,76
PRODUCING ETHYLENE, IT WILL CAUSE THAT FRUIT
TO MAKE


323
0:23:8,76 --> 0:23:11,6
MORE ETHYLENE. IT WILL MAKE MORE ETHYLENE.
IT THE


324
0:23:11,6 --> 0:23:15,65
AUTOCATALYTIC. SO, IF YOU HAVE A DAMAGED APPLE
OR AN


325
0:23:15,65 --> 0:23:20,6
OVER RIPE APPLE, IT IS IN THE VICINITY OF
OTHER FRUITS


326
0:23:20,6 --> 0:23:24,97
WHICH ARE NOT RIPE OR NOT DAMAGED, THIS CAN
CAUSE THE


327
0:23:24,97 --> 0:23:28,81
OTHER FRUITS TO BEGIN TO MAKE ETHYLENE AND
TO SPOIL


328
0:23:28,81 --> 0:23:33,2
VERY QUICKLY. AND THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THE
SAYING,


329
0:23:33,2 --> 0:23:36,97
THAT ONE ROTTEN OR ONE OVERRIPE APPLE WILL
SPOIL THE


330
0:23:36,97 --> 0:23:40,14
BARREL. IT IS THAT ONE APPLE WHICH IS PRODUCING


331
0:23:40,14 --> 0:23:42,59
A LARGE AMOUNT OF ETHYLENE, IF IT IS IN THE
VICINITY


332
0:23:42,59 --> 0:23:45,36
OF OTHER FRUITS THAT ARE OTHERWISE HEALTHY
AND NOT YET


333
0:23:45,36 --> 0:23:48,8
RIPE WILL CAUSE THOSE OTHER FRUITS TO START
MAKING


334
0:23:48,8 --> 0:23:51,24
 ETHYLENE AND THAT ETHYLENE THEN WILL CAUSE
THE FRUITS


335
0:23:51,24 --> 0:23:56,3
TO OVERRIPEN. ETHYLENE HAS WIDE APPLICATIONS.
WE


336
0:23:56,3 --> 0:23:59,0
KNOW THAT IT IS INVOLVED IN THE RIPENING OF
A LARGE


337
0:23:59,0 --> 0:24:3,73
NUMBER OF FRUITS. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN
EXAMPLE OF


338
0:24:3,73 --> 0:24:6,43
A COUPLE OF THE FRUITS THAT MANY OF YOU ARE
FAMILIAR


339
0:24:6,43 --> 0:24:17,16
WITH. MANY CITRUS; ORANGE, GRAPEFRUIT, LEMONS,
A LOT


340
0:24:17,16 --> 0:24:25,55
OF SQUASH FRUITS AND APPLES. ALL OF THESE
FRUITS HAVE


341
0:24:25,55 --> 0:24:30,24
THEIR RIPENING AFFECTED BY ETHYLENE. THE RIPENING


342
0:24:30,24 --> 0:24:34,51
PROCESS CAN BE GREATLY SPEEDED UP IF THERE
IS ETHYLENE


343
0:24:34,51 --> 0:24:37,39
PRESENT. AND MANY OF YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO
TO THE


344
0:24:37,39 --> 0:24:39,4
STORE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU GET TO THE PRODUCE
MARKET


345
0:24:39,4 --> 0:24:41,47
EARLY IN THE MORNING, AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE
FIRST


346
0:24:41,47 --> 0:24:43,89
SHOPPERS THERE. TO GO OVER TO THE BANANA'S
AND YOU


347
0:24:43,89 --> 0:24:46,68
KIND OF SURREPTITIOUSLY TOUCH THE BANANAS,
YOU WILL


348
0:24:46,68 --> 0:24:50,37
FIND THAT THEY'RE WARM. NOT ONLY ARE THEY
WARM, BUT


349
0:24:50,37 --> 0:24:52,47
MOST OF THE BANANA'S ARE GREEN WHEN YOU GET
THEM NOW


350
0:24:52,47 --> 0:24:54,9
IN THE STORES IN BERKELEY AND THAT IS BECAUSE


351
0:24:54,9 --> 0:24:59,65
BANANA'S, WHICH ARE ANOTHER FRUIT THAT IS
AFFECTED BY


352
0:24:59,65 --> 0:25:4,89
 ETHYLENE, ARE PICKED GREEN BEFORE THEY ARE
RIPE. AND


353
0:25:4,89 --> 0:25:9,66
THEN THE PRODUCE LADY OR MAN PRIOR TO PUTTING
THE


354
0:25:9,66 --> 0:25:14,78
BANANA'S OUT FOR YOU TO EAT TAKES THE BANANA'S
AND


355
0:25:14,78 --> 0:25:18,75
PUTS THEM IN A ROOM AND GASSES THEM WITH ETHYLENE.


356
0:25:18,75 --> 0:25:21,27
AND WHEN THIS IS DONE, THIS TRIGGERS THE RIPENING


357
0:25:21,27 --> 0:25:24,92
PROCESS AND CAUSES THE BANANA'S TO BEGIN TO
RIPEN.


358
0:25:24,92 --> 0:25:27,6
THE STARCH THEN IN THE BANANA IS CONVERTED
TO THE


359
0:25:27,6 --> 0:25:30,62
SUGARS. AND THIS IS WHY IF YOU HAVE A BANANA
AND IT


360
0:25:30,62 --> 0:25:34,15
IS NOT RIPE, IF YOU TAKE AN APPLE, AN OVERRIPE
APPLE,


361
0:25:34,15 --> 0:25:37,34
OR IN THIS CASE TAKE A DAMAGED APPLE BECAUSE
THIS ALSO


362
0:25:37,34 --> 0:25:39,57
AS YOU WILL SEE STIMULATES ETHYLENE. YOU TAKE
THE


363
0:25:39,57 --> 0:25:44,29
APPLE AND YOU PUT IT IN A BAG AND THEN TAKE
THE GREEN


364
0:25:44,29 --> 0:25:48,67
BANANA AND PUT IT IN THE BAG AND THEN CLOSE
THE BAG SO


365
0:25:48,67 --> 0:25:52,99
THAT THE ETHYLENE GAS CAN ACCUMULATE, YOU
CAN ACTUALLY


366
0:25:52,99 --> 0:25:55,88
CAUSE THE BANANA TO RIPEN AND VERY QUICKLY
GET


367
0:25:55,88 --> 0:25:58,49
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WHICH IS VERY BROWN AND
IN WHICH


368
0:25:58,49 --> 0:26:1,82
THE SUGARS HAVE BEEN FORMED AS A RESULT OF
THE STARCH


369
0:26:1,82 --> 0:26:4,56
DISAPPEARING. SO THIS IS A VERY PRACTICAL
EXAMPLE.


370
0:26:4,56 --> 0:26:8,9
 BANANA'S ARE TYPICALLY TREATED WITH ETHYLENE.
ANOTHER


371
0:26:8,9 --> 0:26:11,36
EXAMPLE OF ETHYLENE'S RESULTS ARE FOUND IN
SOME OF


372
0:26:11,36 --> 0:26:13,69
THESE FRUITS; YOU GUYS KNOW THESE AS KIWI'S
AND


373
0:26:13,69 --> 0:26:17,59
AVOCADO'S. THESE ARE TWO FRUITS WHICH MOST
OF YOU, AT


374
0:26:17,59 --> 0:26:20,7
LEAST WE CAN GROW KIWI'S PRETTY WELL IN THE
BAY AREA,


375
0:26:20,7 --> 0:26:22,5
AND IN SOME PLACES WE CAN GROW AVOCADO'S.
IF YOU


376
0:26:22,5 --> 0:26:25,45
LEAVE THEM ON THE PLANT THEY GENERAL DON'T
RIPEN OR


377
0:26:25,45 --> 0:26:27,73
THEY DON'T RIPEN UNTIL THE FRUIT'S BEGIN TO
DRY AND


378
0:26:27,73 --> 0:26:30,29
ARE NO LONG ERE GOOD TO EAT. THE REASON THEY
DON'T


379
0:26:30,29 --> 0:26:33,5
RIPEN IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO ETHYLENE PRODUCTION
OR


380
0:26:33,5 --> 0:26:35,25
VERY LITTLE ETHYLENE PRODUCTION CARRYING ON
IN THE


381
0:26:35,25 --> 0:26:38,36
FRUIT. BUT, BY PICKING THESE FRUITS YOU ARE
DAMAGING


382
0:26:38,36 --> 0:26:41,71
THEIR ENDS BY BREAKING THEM OFF OF THE PLANT,
AND THAT


383
0:26:41,71 --> 0:26:44,96
DAMAGE ACTUALLY STARTS ETHYLENE PRODUCTION
AND CAUSES


384
0:26:44,96 --> 0:26:47,57
THE RIPENING OF THE FRUITS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT


385
0:26:47,57 --> 0:26:49,99
EFFECT OF ETHYLENE IN CONTROLLING RIPENING
YOUR


386
0:26:49,99 --> 0:26:50,25
FRUITS.


387
0:26:50,25 --> 0:26:58,46
NOW, BECAUSE ETHYLENE IS SO IMPORTANT IN THE
 FARMING AND IN OUR PRODUCE INDUSTRY, A LOT


388
0:26:58,46 --> 0:26:58,86
OF PEOPLE


389
0:26:58,86 --> 0:27:1,77
HAVE PUT A LOT OF TIME INTO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
HOW


390
0:27:1,77 --> 0:27:4,67
WE CAN PROLONG THE SHELF LIFE THE FRUITS BY
TREATING


391
0:27:4,67 --> 0:27:6,96
FRUITS WITH ETHYLENE OR BY PREVENTING ETHYLENE


392
0:27:6,96 --> 0:27:9,71
ACCUMULATING. YOU SHOULD REALIZE THAT ETHYLENE
IS


393
0:27:9,71 --> 0:27:12,19
A NATURALLY OCCURRING COMPOUND. WE HAVE BEEN
EXPOSED


394
0:27:12,19 --> 0:27:14,88
TO IT ALL OF OUR EVOLUTION AS HUMANS. SO IT
IS NOT


395
0:27:14,88 --> 0:27:17,87
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE REGULATED BY THE
GOVERNMENT.


396
0:27:17,87 --> 0:27:21,89
WHAT WAS FOUND, WAS THAT IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
HOW


397
0:27:21,89 --> 0:27:25,73
ETHYLENE CAUSES RIPENING, AND HOW WE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO


398
0:27:25,73 --> 0:27:28,56
SLOW DOWN RIPENING, SURE YOU COULD STORE THESE


399
0:27:28,56 --> 0:27:32,4
BANANA'S IN A ROOM AND CONSTANTLY CHANGE THE
AIR IN


400
0:27:32,4 --> 0:27:35,3
THE ROOM TO PREVENT THE ACCUMULATION OF ETHYLENE
AND


401
0:27:35,3 --> 0:27:37,55
THERE BY PREVENT THE AUTOCATALYTIC RESPONSE.
OR


402
0:27:37,55 --> 0:27:40,29
PERHAPS THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY, A MORE ECONOMICAL
WAY.


403
0:27:40,29 --> 0:27:43,93
AND SO WHAT WORKERS WERE ABLE TO FIND IS THAT
IF YOU


404
0:27:43,93 --> 0:27:48,52
STORED BANANA'S AND MANY FRUITS IN ROOMS WHICH
CONTAIN


405
0:27:48,52 --> 0:27:57,55
5 TO 10 PERCENT CO2 THAT YOU COULD INHIBIT
RIPENING.


406
0:27:57,55 --> 0:28:4,61
 INHIBIT RIPENING. NOW, MOST OF YOU KNOW
AT LEAST IN


407
0:28:4,61 --> 0:28:8,33
OUR GLOBE TODAY, BUT IT WILL CHANGE TOMORROW,
SURELY


408
0:28:8,33 --> 0:28:15,1
THAT THE NORMAL CO2 LEVELS ARE 0.03 TO 0.04
PERCENT.


409
0:28:15,1 --> 0:28:19,99
SO, WE ARE GREATLY INCREASING THE ATMOSPHERE
WITH CO2


410
0:28:19,99 --> 0:28:23,34
AROUND THESE FRUITS THAT ARE IN STORAGE. AND
WHEN YOU


411
0:28:23,34 --> 0:28:26,23
STORE FRUITS IN AN ATMOSPHERE THAT HAS 5 TO
10 PERCENT


412
0:28:26,23 --> 0:28:33,73
CO2, WHAT APPEARS TO HAPPEN IS THAT THE PROCESSES


413
0:28:33,73 --> 0:28:50,39
AFFECTED BY ETHYLENE ARE SLOWED DOWN OR INHIBITED.


414
0:28:50,39 --> 0:28:54,46
MAY BE THAT THE RECEPTOR FOR THE ETHYLENE
ALSO BINDS


415
0:28:54,46 --> 0:28:57,78
CO2 SO THAT THE TWO GASSES COMPETE FOR THE
SAME


416
0:28:57,78 --> 0:29:2,18
RECEPTOR. THIS IS THE BASIS THEN FOR BEING
ABLE TO


417
0:29:2,18 --> 0:29:5,17
PROLONG THE SHELF LIFE OF MANY FRUITS BY MANIPULATING


418
0:29:5,17 --> 0:29:7,9
THE ATMOSPHERE. THERE ARE ALSO PROBLEMS HOWEVER,
AND


419
0:29:7,9 --> 0:29:9,81
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE ENCOUNTERED THIS. IF
FRUITS ARE


420
0:29:9,81 --> 0:29:13,14
STORED FOR TOO LONG IN A CO2 ATMOSPHERE OR
IN TOO HIGH


421
0:29:13,14 --> 0:29:15,72
CO2, AND I WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF THIS,
THEY CAN


422
0:29:15,72 --> 0:29:18,83
BE DAMAGED. AND SO SOME OF YOU I KNOW I HAVE,
HAVE


423
0:29:18,83 --> 0:29:21,87
CUT OPEN APPLES AND FOUND THEM LOOKING GOOD
ON THE


424
0:29:21,87 --> 0:29:24,4
 OUTSIDE BUT BROWN ON THE INSIDE. AND THAT
BROWNNESS


425
0:29:24,4 --> 0:29:27,12
ON THE INSIDE IS AN INDICATION THAT THEY WERE
STORED


426
0:29:27,12 --> 0:29:30,68
EITHER FOR TOO LONG OR TOO MUCH OF A TIME
IN AN


427
0:29:30,68 --> 0:29:34,19
ETHYLENE ATMOSPHERE. VERY IMPORTANT GROWTH
REGULATOR.


428
0:29:34,19 --> 0:29:36,32
THE OTHER POINT I WANTED TO MENTION WITH REGARD
TO


429
0:29:36,32 --> 0:29:39,54
ETHYLENE AND MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THIS,
IS THAT


430
0:29:39,54 --> 0:29:42,46
WHEN YOU RECEIVE FLOWERS, FOR EXAMPLE, VALENTINE'S
DAY


431
0:29:42,46 --> 0:29:44,88
IS COMING UP. YOU FREQUENTLY RECEIVE A LITTLE
PACKET


432
0:29:44,88 --> 0:29:48,87
OF POWDER WITH THE FLOWERS WHICH YOU ARE SUPPOSED
TO


433
0:29:48,87 --> 0:29:51,56
PUT INTO THE LIQUID AND TO PROLONG THE SHELF
LIFE OF


434
0:29:51,56 --> 0:29:54,96
THE FLOWERS. THESE PACKETS CONTAIN RELATIVELY


435
0:29:54,96 --> 0:30:0,22
INNOCUOUS COMPOUNDS WHICH AS THE CO2 DOES
COMPETE WITH


436
0:30:0,22 --> 0:30:3,59
OR SOMEHOW RETARDED THE EFFECT OF ETHYLENE
AND


437
0:30:3,59 --> 0:30:6,72
THEREBY, PROLONG THE LIFE OF THE FLOWERS.
YOU CAN


438
0:30:6,72 --> 0:30:9,61
ALSO, BY THE WAY, TAKE AN ASPIRIN AND PUT
AN ASPIRIN


439
0:30:9,61 --> 0:30:13,1
IN THE WATER BECAUSE ASPIRIN ITSELF, THE COMPOUND


440
0:30:13,1 --> 0:30:16,61
SALICYLIC ACID ALSO COMPETES OR IN SOME WAY
INHIBITS


441
0:30:16,61 --> 0:30:19,38
THE ETHYLENE RIPENING OR THE ETHYLENE MATURING
PROCESS


442
0:30:19,38 --> 0:30:22,53
 AND THEREBY, ARE ABLE TO PROLONG THE SHELF
LIFE OF


443
0:30:22,53 --> 0:30:26,9
THESE FLOWERS. NOW, ANOTHER ASPECT OF ETHYLENE,
WHICH


444
0:30:26,9 --> 0:30:29,34
WE WANT TO CONSIDER, IS THAT IN SOME CROPS
WHICH ALSO


445
0:30:29,34 --> 0:30:31,48
MAKES ETHYLENE COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT, AND
THE ONES


446
0:30:31,48 --> 0:30:37,42
THAT I WANT TO MENTION TO YOU ARE PINEAPPLE


447
0:30:37,42 --> 0:30:43,6
AND MANGOS. THESE CROPS YOU CAN STIMULATE
THEM TO


448
0:30:43,6 --> 0:30:51,37
FLOWER


449
0:30:51,37 --> 0:30:55,67
WITH ETHYLENE. AND SO, FOR A FARMER THIS CAN


450
0:30:55,67 --> 0:30:59,67
COMMERCIALLY BE A VERY IMPORTANT ADDED BONUS
TO HIS OR


451
0:30:59,67 --> 0:31:2,25
HER CROPS BECAUSE YOU CAN CAUSE ALL OF THE
PLANTS TO


452
0:31:2,25 --> 0:31:5,4
FLOWER AT ONE TIME. ALL OF THEM TO SET FRUIT
AT ONE


453
0:31:5,4 --> 0:31:7,75
TIME AND THEN YOU CAN HARVEST THEM ALL AT
ONE TIME.


454
0:31:7,75 --> 0:31:10,87
SO, FOR SOME PLANTS YOU CAN STIMULATE FLOWERING
WITH


455
0:31:10,87 --> 0:31:13,61
ETHYLENE. IN CALIFORNIA, WE DON'T NORMALLY


456
0:31:13,61 --> 0:31:16,58
GROW MANGO AND PINEAPPLES BUT ETHYLENE STILL
SERVES


457
0:31:16,58 --> 0:31:19,76
BESIDES CONTROLLING FRUIT RIPENING, ANOTHER
VERY


458
0:31:19,76 --> 0:31:23,42
IMPORTANT, EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PROCESS. IN
THE


459
0:31:23,42 --> 0:31:25,43
CENTRAL VALLEY, IF YOU GUYS GO THROUGH THE
CENTRAL


460
0:31:25,43 --> 0:31:28,11
VALLEY IN THE FALL AND YOU HAPPEN TO PASS
A CHERRY


461
0:31:28,11 --> 0:31:31,52
 ORCHARD OR WALNUT ORCHARD THESE ARE CROPS
WHICH ARE


462
0:31:31,52 --> 0:31:35,48
VERY LABOR INTENSIVE AS FAR AS HARVESTING
THE FRUIT.


463
0:31:35,48 --> 0:31:38,43
IF YOU TREAT THOSE TREES WITH A COMPOUND WHICH


464
0:31:38,43 --> 0:31:41,42
STIMULATES NATURAL ETHYLENE PRODUCTION IN
THESE


465
0:31:41,42 --> 0:31:44,34
PLANTS, IN THE WALNUT PLANT OR IN THE CHERRY
PLANTS,


466
0:31:44,34 --> 0:31:54,77
WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ACTIVATES THE ABSCISSION
ZONE.


467
0:31:54,77 --> 0:31:58,6
ACTIVATES THE ABSCISSION ZONE. SO THESE CHERRY
FRUITS


468
0:31:58,6 --> 0:32:1,72
AND WALNUTS ARE ALREADY JUST SORT OF WEAKLY
ATTACHED


469
0:32:1,72 --> 0:32:4,6
TO THE PLANT. THEY ARE VERY TENUOUS AS FAR
AS THEIR


470
0:32:4,6 --> 0:32:7,47
ATTACHMENT. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS, THE
FARMER WILL


471
0:32:7,47 --> 0:32:10,49
SPREAD A TARP BENEATH THE TREES THAT HAVE
BEEN TREATED


472
0:32:10,49 --> 0:32:14,17
WITH THE ETHYLENE INDUCING COMPOUND AND TAKE


473
0:32:14,17 --> 0:32:16,62
A MACHINE, WHICH LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM
THE SCIENCE


474
0:32:16,62 --> 0:32:20,19
FICTION MOVIE, WHICH HAS TWO BIG CLAWS ON
IT. AND THE


475
0:32:20,19 --> 0:32:22,9
MACHINE COVERS THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE TREE
AND


476
0:32:22,9 --> 0:32:26,96
SHAKES THE TREE AND IN THE PROCESS THE FRUITS
ARE


477
0:32:26,96 --> 0:32:28,7
PICKED, SO TO SPEAK, AND THEY FALL DOWN ON
THE GROUND.


478
0:32:28,7 --> 0:32:31,34
AND THIS SAVES A LOT OF LABOR AND A LOT OF
TIME AND


479
0:32:31,34 --> 0:32:34,16
 MAKES FRUITS, AT LEAST NOT AS EXPENSIVE
AS THEY MAY BE


480
0:32:34,16 --> 0:32:37,34
IF YOU HAD TO PICK THEM INDIVIDUALLY. LET
ME SHOW YOU


481
0:32:37,34 --> 0:32:41,95
NOW SOME PICTURES OF ETHYLENE. AND LET'S GET
THIS


482
0:32:41,95 --> 0:32:53,4
BACK HERE AGAIN. WE SEEM TO BE -- 


483
0:32:53,4 --> 0:32:56,41
OKAY. SO, THIS


484
0:32:56,41 --> 0:33:1,44
FIRST SLIDE IS MEANT TO SHOW YOU EPINASTY
WHICH OCCURS


485
0:33:1,44 --> 0:33:5,14
IN PLANTS TREATED WITH ETHYLENE. HERE IS THE
NORMAL


486
0:33:5,14 --> 0:33:7,85
PLANT. THAT WOULD BE THE KIND OF SITUATION
YOU WOULD


487
0:33:7,85 --> 0:33:11,24
SEE IN PLANTS IN WHICH THE GAS IN THE ROOM
WAS


488
0:33:11,24 --> 0:33:14,58
CONTAMINATED WITH ETHYLENE. HERE IS THE CAST
IRON


489
0:33:14,58 --> 0:33:18,45
PLANT. AGAIN, IF A MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE
AS REAL AS


490
0:33:18,45 --> 0:33:21,46
IT IS AS FAR AS THE SETTING FOR VICTORIAN
HOME, THIS


491
0:33:21,46 --> 0:33:24,19
IS THE ONLY PLANT THAT YOU SHOULD FIND GROWING
IN THAT


492
0:33:24,19 --> 0:33:26,71
PARTICULAR SITUATION. HERE ARE BANANA'S, AGAIN


493
0:33:26,71 --> 0:33:29,78
BANANA'S ARE PICKED AS MOST OF YOU KNOW, GREEN.
AND


494
0:33:29,78 --> 0:33:33,45
THEN THEY ARE HELD IN CO2 ATMOSPHERE, CO2
ENRICHED


495
0:33:33,45 --> 0:33:36,2
ATMOSPHERE, REMOVED FROM THAT ATMOSPHERE BEFORE
THEY


496
0:33:36,2 --> 0:33:39,27
ARE TO BE PUT OUT AND THEN TREATED WITH ETHYLENE.
AND


497
0:33:39,27 --> 0:33:42,1
THE LAST SLIDE I WANT TO SHOW YOU ARE APPLES
WHICH


498
0:33:42,1 --> 0:33:45,66
 HAVE BEEN STORED IN ENVIRONMENTS OR IN ATMOSPHERES
IN


499
0:33:45,66 --> 0:33:48,5
WHICH THE CO2 CONCENTRATION WAS EITHER NOT
WELL


500
0:33:48,5 --> 0:33:51,7
REGULATED OR THE APPLES WERE LEFT TOO LONG
IN THIS


501
0:33:51,7 --> 0:33:53,5
ATMOSPHERE AND THIS IS THE TYPE OF DAMAGE
THAT YOU


502
0:33:53,5 --> 0:33:56,1
WOULD SEE IN THOSE SORTS OF FRUITS. SO, IF
ANY OF YOU


503
0:33:56,1 --> 0:33:58,76
HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED ANYTHING LIKE THIS,
THESE ARE


504
0:33:58,76 --> 0:34:2,83
A RESULT MOST LIKELY OF HIGH LEVELS OF CO2
IN THE


505
0:34:2,83 --> 0:34:10,51
ATMOSPHERE. OKAY. SO, THAT IS THE FOURTH GROUP
OF


506
0:34:10,51 --> 0:34:12,96
GROWTH REGULATORS, A VERY IMPORTANT GROUP.
THE MOST


507
0:34:12,96 --> 0:34:14,909
IMPORTANT COMMERCIALLY OF ALL OF THE REGULATORS
THAT


508
0:34:14,909 --> 0:34:18,6
WE WILL CONTINUE WITH. FINALLY, IN THE LAST
15 OR 20


509
0:34:18,6 --> 0:34:20,62
MINUTES I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE LAST
GROUP OF


510
0:34:20,62 --> 0:34:23,389
GROWTH REGULATORS. IT HAS A VERY INTERESTING
HISTORY


511
0:34:23,389 --> 0:34:26,2
OF DISCOVERY. AND THIS GROWTH REGULATED GROUP
WAS


512
0:34:26,2 --> 0:34:30,75
DISCOVERED TWICE INDEPENDENTLY AT THE SAME
TIME. AND


513
0:34:30,75 --> 0:34:33,6
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS
THAT


514
0:34:33,6 --> 0:34:36,389
DISCOVERED IT AT THE SAME TIME. THE FIRST
GROUP THAT


515
0:34:36,389 --> 0:34:39,9
DISCOVERED IT WAS IN WALES, IN THE UNITED
KINGDOM.


516
0:34:39,9 --> 0:34:43,159
 THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE INTERESTED IN THE
FACT THAT


517
0:34:43,159 --> 0:34:45,7
DORMANT BUDS, WHICH YOU CAN JUST SEE NOW BEGINNING
TO


518
0:34:45,7 --> 0:34:50,44
BURST ON THE OUTSIDE, DORMANT BUDS COULD BE
CAUSE TO


519
0:34:50,44 --> 0:34:53,38
BURST PREMATURELY, THAT IS, THE LEAVES COULD
BE CAUSE


520
0:34:53,38 --> 0:34:57,3
TO COME OUT PREMATURELY IF YOU REMOVE THE
SCALES THAT


521
0:34:57,3 --> 0:35:0,65
WERE COVERING OVER THE END OF THE BUD. SO,
THESE


522
0:35:0,65 --> 0:35:4,73
SCALES THEY HYPOTHESIZE CONTAIN SOME COMPOUNDS,
SOME


523
0:35:4,73 --> 0:35:8,64
SOLUTION, SOME MATERIAL WHICH KEPT THE BUDS
DORMANT.


524
0:35:8,64 --> 0:35:12,74
AND, WHEN THEY EXTRACTED, AND HERE IS ONE
IN WHICH THE


525
0:35:12,74 --> 0:35:14,99
BUD SCALES HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND THINGS ARE
BEGINNING


526
0:35:14,99 --> 0:35:17,6
TO COME OUT, WHEN THESE INDIVIDUALS IN WALES


527
0:35:17,6 --> 0:35:19,98
EXTRACTED, THEY COLLECTED A LOT OF SCALES
FROM THESE


528
0:35:19,98 --> 0:35:24,91
BUDS, AND EXTRACTED THEM, THEY FOUND A COMPOUND
WHICH


529
0:35:24,91 --> 0:35:28,39
WHEN APPLIED BACK TO THE PLANT COULD KEEP
IT DORMANT.


530
0:35:28,39 --> 0:35:36,92
AND THEY CALLED THIS COMPOUND DORMIN BECAUSE
IT KEPT


531
0:35:36,92 --> 0:35:45,41
OR MAINTAINED DORMANCY.


532
0:35:45,41 --> 0:35:46,25
NOW WHILE THEY WERE CARRYING


533
0:35:46,25 --> 0:35:50,3
OUT THIS WORK IN WALES, FARMERS IN DAVIS FOR
THE


534
0:35:50,3 --> 0:35:56,7
CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA BECAME INCREASINGLY
 CONCERNED BECAUSE OF THE PHENOMENON THAT


535
0:35:56,7 --> 0:35:56,1
WAS


536
0:35:56,1 --> 0:35:59,56
ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE PLANTING OF COTTON.
WHAT


537
0:35:59,56 --> 0:36:4,7
FARMERS FOUND WAS THAT IN JUNE OF EVERY YEAR
THE


538
0:36:4,7 --> 0:36:7,42
COTTON BOWLS, THAT IS, THE THINGS WHICH KEPT
ALL THE


539
0:36:7,42 --> 0:36:11,4
COTTON HAIRS TOGETHER INSIDE. COTTON BOWLS
WOULD FALL


540
0:36:11,4 --> 0:36:14,25
OFF OF THE PLANT. THEY WOULD LOSE 10 TO 30
PERCENT OF


541
0:36:14,25 --> 0:36:21,67
THESE COTTON BOWLS IN JUNE. SO CALLED JUNE
DROP. AND


542
0:36:21,67 --> 0:36:23,71
THEY WERE CONCERNED OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE IT DECREASED
THE


543
0:36:23,71 --> 0:36:26,1
AMOUNT OF COTTON, WHICH THEY HARVESTED AND
THEREFORE,


544
0:36:26,1 --> 0:36:29,88
DECREASED HOW MUCH MONEY THEY GOT. AND SO,
THEY


545
0:36:29,88 --> 0:36:33,65
BROUGHT THIS PROBLEM TO PEOPLE AT DAVIS, U
C DAVIS,


546
0:36:33,65 --> 0:36:36,7
AND THEY ASKED THEM, COULD THEY HELP TO DETERMINE
WHAT


547
0:36:36,7 --> 0:36:40,1
IT WAS THAT WAS CAUSING THESE COTTON BOWLS
TO DROP TO


548
0:36:40,1 --> 0:36:42,85
THE GROUND, THIS SO CALLED JUNE DROP. AND
THE PEOPLE


549
0:36:42,85 --> 0:36:47,52
AT DAVIS DISCOVERED THAT PRIOR, JUST PRIOR
TO THE


550
0:36:47,52 --> 0:36:50,93
FALLING OF THE COTTON FROM THE PLANTS, THAT
A COMPOUND


551
0:36:50,93 --> 0:36:54,55
WAS INCREASING IN THE PLANT AND THAT THIS
COMPOUND


552
0:36:54,55 --> 0:36:56,91
WHEN APPLIED BACK TO THE PLANT AFTER IT WAS
EXTRACTED


553
0:36:56,91 --> 0:37:1,35
 COULD SURE ENOUGH CAUSE THESE COTTON BOWLS
TO FALL


554
0:37:1,35 --> 0:37:6,28
OFF. AND BECAUSE THESE FALLING OFF IS THE
SAME AS


555
0:37:6,28 --> 0:37:13,4
ABSCISING, THIS COMPOUND WHICH THEY ISOLATED
IT AND


556
0:37:13,4 --> 0:37:14,57
IDENTIFIED WAS KNOWN AS ABSCISING. THIS COMPOUND


557
0:37:14,57 --> 0:37:14,57
WHICH THEY ISOLATED AND IDENTIFIED WAS KNOWN
AS


558
0:37:14,57 --> 0:37:21,16
ABSCISIC ACID. THIS COMPOUND WHICH CAUSED
THE COTTON


559
0:37:21,16 --> 0:37:27,6
BOWLS TO FALL OFF. AND WE NOW KNOW THAT ABSCISIC
ACID


560
0:37:27,6 --> 0:37:33,9
AND DORMIN ARE THE SAME COMPOUND. THEY ARE
COMPOUNDS


561
0:37:33,9 --> 0:37:38,5
WHICH IN THIS CASE CAUSE THE COTTON'S TO ABSCISE
AND


562
0:37:38,5 --> 0:37:43,2
IN THE CASE OF THE DORMANT TO MAINTAIN DORMANCY.


563
0:37:43,2 --> 0:37:49,45
ABSCISIC ACID IS A 5TH GROWTH REGULATOR. AND
PROBABLY


564
0:37:49,45 --> 0:37:52,98
IF WE HAD TO SUMMARIZE WHERE IT WORKS MOST
OR WHAT ITS


565
0:37:52,98 --> 0:37:56,22
EFFECTS ARE, WE COULD SAY THAT ABSCISIC ACID,
WHICH I


566
0:37:56,22 --> 0:38:2,14
WILL ABBREVIATE AS ABA ABSCISIC ACID, IS A
GROWTH


567
0:38:2,14 --> 0:38:24,99
REGULATOR INVOLVED WITH RESPONSES TO PLANTS
TO STRESS.


568
0:38:24,99 --> 0:38:29,28
AND LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES NOW OF THE
RESPONSES


569
0:38:29,28 --> 0:38:33,46
OF PLANTS TO STRESS. LET'S LOOK AT A PLANT
WHICH IS


570
0:38:33,46 --> 0:38:38,31
GROWING IN SOIL IN WHICH THE WATER IS GRADUALLY
BEING


571
0:38:38,31 --> 0:38:43,43
 DEPLETED FROM THE SOIL. SO HERE WE HAVE
A PLANT WHICH


572
0:38:43,43 --> 0:38:47,49
IS GROWING IN SOIL AND WE NOW HAVE, FIRST
OF ALL, THE


573
0:38:47,49 --> 0:38:57,73
DEPLETION OF WATER. DEPLETION OF WATER IN
THE SOIL.


574
0:38:57,73 --> 0:39:1,97
NOW, IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION WE KNOW
THAT WATER


575
0:39:1,97 --> 0:39:5,5
IS GOING LIKE THIS, AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT
THIS MORE,


576
0:39:5,5 --> 0:39:7,56
AND IS EXITING THE PLANT THROUGH THE LEAVES,
THROUGH


577
0:39:7,56 --> 0:39:16,9
THE STOMATA.


578
0:39:16,9 --> 0:39:18,78
WATER LEAVES. NOW, IF THE PLANT DID NOT


579
0:39:18,78 --> 0:39:24,99
HAVE ANY WAY OF CONTROLLING WATER THAT IT
WAS LOSING,


580
0:39:24,99 --> 0:39:27,45
BECAUSE IT IS NOT BEING ABLE TO REPLACE IT
FROM THE


581
0:39:27,45 --> 0:39:32,57
SOIL, THAT PLANT WOULD DRY, WOULD DRY OUT.
SO, WHEN


582
0:39:32,57 --> 0:39:35,72
THERE IS A DEPLETION OF WATER IN THE SOIL,
THIS IS


583
0:39:35,72 --> 0:39:48,76
SENSED BY THE ROOTS, WHICH MAKE ABA. MAKE
ABA.


584
0:39:48,76 --> 0:39:58,3
THIS ABA MOVES TO THIS STOMATA AND CAUSES
THEM TO


585
0:39:58,3 --> 0:40:6,3
CLOSE.


586
0:40:6,3 --> 0:40:8,47
AND THEREBY, PREVENT THE PLANT FROM DRYING


587
0:40:8,47 --> 0:40:15,29
OUT. THERE ARE A LOT OF MUTANT PLANTS AND
ONE OF THE


588
0:40:15,29 --> 0:40:21,76
MUTANT PLANTS IS CALLED DROOPY. IN DROOPY,
THIS PLANT


589
0:40:21,76 --> 0:40:34,21
CANNOT MAKE ABA. CAN'T MAKE ABA. SO IF YOU
PUT A


590
0:40:34,21 --> 0:40:38,16
PLANT LIKE THAT IN SOIL WHICH IS DEPLETED
IN ITS


591
0:40:38,16 --> 0:40:42,84
 WATER, DROOPY CAN'T SEND A SIGNAL TO THE
STOMATA.


592
0:40:42,84 --> 0:40:45,37
CAN'T TELL THEM TO CLOSE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
HAVE THAT


593
0:40:45,37 --> 0:40:48,99
SIGNAL TO MAKE. AND THOSE PLANTS THEN LOOK
WILTED.


594
0:40:48,99 --> 0:40:51,76
HOWEVER, IF YOU TAKE DROOPY AND YOU SPRAY
IT


595
0:40:51,76 --> 0:40:55,62
WITH ABA YOU CAN GET THAT PLANT THEN TO ILLUSTRATE
OR


596
0:40:55,62 --> 0:41:0,94
TO SHOW A NORMAL RESPONSE TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
ANOTHER


597
0:41:0,94 --> 0:41:5,32
WAY IN WHICH ABA SEEMS TO BE INVOLVED IN STRESS
IS IN


598
0:41:5,32 --> 0:41:8,97
PLANTS THAT ARE GROWING IN SOILS THAT ARE
VERY SALTY.


599
0:41:8,97 --> 0:41:12,8
IN CALIFORNIA, AND IN MANY PORTIONS OF THE
WORLD A


600
0:41:12,8 --> 0:41:15,4
LARGE AMOUNT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IS BEING
LOST TO THE


601
0:41:15,4 --> 0:41:18,63
FACT THAT SALT WATER IS COMING IN OR SALTS
ARE


602
0:41:18,63 --> 0:41:21,32
ACCUMULATING IN THE SOILS AND THIS IS PREVENTING
THE


603
0:41:21,32 --> 0:41:23,83
PLANTS TO GROW. WE ARE LOSING A LARGE AMOUNT
OF


604
0:41:23,83 --> 0:41:28,11
AGRICULTURAL LAND THAT WAY. ABA IN PLANTS
THAT ARE


605
0:41:28,11 --> 0:41:31,7
EXPOSED TO THE SALTY ENVIRONMENT, ABA SEEMS
TO


606
0:41:31,7 --> 0:41:41,82
TRIGGER, SO IN A SALTY ENVIRONMENT


607
0:41:41,82 --> 0:41:44,11
TRIGGERS THE


608
0:41:44,11 --> 0:41:52,83
PRODUCTION OF PROTEINS


609
0:41:52,83 --> 0:41:57,31
ALLOWING PLANTS TO RESIST THIS


610
0:41:57,31 --> 0:42:14,91
ENVIRONMENT OR AT LEAST TO TOLERATE IT. PERHAPS
THE


611
0:42:14,91 --> 0:42:19,4
 MOST INTERESTING ASPECT OF THE ABA THAT
I FIND MOST


612
0:42:19,4 --> 0:42:26,68
INTERESTING HAS TO DO WITH SEED GERMINATION.
MOST OF


613
0:42:26,68 --> 0:42:30,15
YOU KNOW THAT THE SEED IS FORMED AT THE END
OF THE


614
0:42:30,15 --> 0:42:34,15
GROWING SEASON AND THEN USUALLY THE CLIMATE
CHANGES


615
0:42:34,15 --> 0:42:37,21
SOMEHOW. IF YOU COME FROM THE EAST, THE CLIMATE
GETS


616
0:42:37,21 --> 0:42:40,5
REALLY COLD. HERE IT GETS COLD BUT NOT AS
COLD AS THE


617
0:42:40,5 --> 0:42:43,59
EAST. AND SO, WE VIEW THE SEED AS A WAY OF
ALLOWING


618
0:42:43,59 --> 0:42:47,99
THE PLANT TO PASS THROUGH THIS BAD PERIOD
OF TIME WHEN


619
0:42:47,99 --> 0:42:50,44
GROWTH WOULD NOT NORMALLY OCCUR. THE PLANT
REMAINS


620
0:42:50,44 --> 0:42:53,86
DORMANT. BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY FOR
THAT SEED


621
0:42:53,86 --> 0:42:59,12
TO KNOW THAT THE COLD PERIOD HAS NOW GONE
PAST AND


622
0:42:59,12 --> 0:43:1,72
THAT THE CLIMATE OUTSIDE CAN ALLOW THE SEED
TO


623
0:43:1,72 --> 0:43:4,48
GERMINATE AND TO GROW. AND THIS IS WHERE ABA
HAS


624
0:43:4,48 --> 0:43:9,15
A VERY STRONG EFFECT. WHAT WE FIND IS THAT
IN SEED


625
0:43:9,15 --> 0:43:34,89
COATS FOLLOWING ABA AND OTHER RELATED COMPOUNDS
ARE AT


626
0:43:34,89 --> 0:43:40,52
HIGH LEVELS.


627
0:43:40,52 --> 0:43:43,5
HIGH LEVELS. AND THIS INHIBITS


628
0:43:43,5 --> 0:43:54,8
GERMINATION. AND WHAT HAPPENS, APPARENTLY,
IS THAT


629
0:43:54,8 --> 0:44:11,48
COLD OR PERIODS OF COLD YIELD A BREAKDOWN
IN ABA. AND


630
0:44:11,48 --> 0:44:14,84
 AFTER A PLANT HAS HAD A LONG ENOUGH PERIOD
OF COLD


631
0:44:14,84 --> 0:44:17,72
THE ABA LEVELS AND THE OTHER INHIBITOR LEVELS
HAVE


632
0:44:17,72 --> 0:44:20,83
DROPPED TO SUCH A CONCENTRATION THAT GERMINATION
CAN


633
0:44:20,83 --> 0:44:24,37
NOW GO ON. SOME OF US HERE IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE


634
0:44:24,37 --> 0:44:27,76
SEEDS WHICH NORMALLY WOULD GROW IN A COLD
CLIMATE AND


635
0:44:27,76 --> 0:44:30,6
WE ARE TOLD THAT IF WE WANT TO GET THOSE SEEDS
TO


636
0:44:30,6 --> 0:44:33,53
GERMINATE WE HAVE TO ALSO GIVE THEM ALONG
PERIOD OF


637
0:44:33,53 --> 0:44:36,15
COLD. WE ARE TOLD TO PUT THEM IN A REFRIGERATOR
OR


638
0:44:36,15 --> 0:44:44,63
FREEZER. THIS PROCESS OF COLD TREATMENT IS
CALLED


639
0:44:44,63 --> 0:44:51,89
STRATEGY STRATIFICATION AND BASICALLY, YOU
ARE DOING


640
0:44:51,89 --> 0:44:55,19
THE SAME THING THAT THE COLD NORMALLY WOULD
DO BY


641
0:44:55,19 --> 0:44:58,58
KEEPING YOUR SEEDS IN THE REFRIGERATOR YOU
ARE CAUSING


642
0:44:58,58 --> 0:45:2,5
THESE INHIBITORY COMPOUNDS INCLUDING ABA TO
GRADUALLY


643
0:45:2,5 --> 0:45:6,68
BE REDUCED. I WANT TO MENTION TO YOU THAT
THIS SAME


644
0:45:6,68 --> 0:45:9,25
KIND OF SYSTEM OPERATES IN PLANTS WHICH GROW
IN


645
0:45:9,25 --> 0:45:11,88
ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY COLD.
LIKE FOR


646
0:45:11,88 --> 0:45:15,84
EXAMPLE, THE DESERT. IN THE DESERT THE BIG
ISSUE OF


647
0:45:15,84 --> 0:45:19,13
A SEED GETTING STARTED IS HAVING ENOUGH WATER.
HOW IS


648
0:45:19,13 --> 0:45:22,62
 A SEED GOING TO KNOW THAT THERE IS ENOUGH
RAIN TO


649
0:45:22,62 --> 0:45:25,99
ALLOW IT TO ESTABLISH ITS ROOT SYSTEM? IN
THIS


650
0:45:25,99 --> 0:45:31,8
PARTICULAR SITUATION WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT,
HERE IS THE


651
0:45:31,8 --> 0:45:36,56
SEED AND THE SEED COAT, THE INHIBITOR IS IN
THE


652
0:45:36,56 --> 0:45:41,72
COAT, INHIBITOR IS IN THE COAT, AND THEN WHAT
HAPPENS


653
0:45:41,72 --> 0:45:45,75
IS THAT IF THE RAIN IS A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH
RAIN TO


654
0:45:45,75 --> 0:45:51,7
ALLOW THE SEED TO ESTABLISH ITSELF, IT IS
ALSO


655
0:45:51,7 --> 0:45:55,9
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RAIN TO HAVE WASHED
OUT THE


656
0:45:55,9 --> 0:45:59,63
INHIBITOR. SO, IF WE CAN WASH OUT THE INHIBITOR,
THAT


657
0:45:59,63 --> 0:46:1,72
IS TELLING THE SEED THERE IS ENOUGH WATER
TO


658
0:46:1,72 --> 0:46:5,21
GERMINATE, ENOUGH WATER TO ESTABLISH YOURSELF.
NOW,


659
0:46:5,21 --> 0:46:8,0
THERE ARE WAYS OF TRICKING THE SYSTEM IN THE
DESERT


660
0:46:8,0 --> 0:46:11,28
AND THIS SOMETIMES HAPPENS. IF YOU HAVE A
LOT OF


661
0:46:11,28 --> 0:46:15,11
SHORT RAINS, TINY RAINS, AND EACH ONE OF THEM
WASHES


662
0:46:15,11 --> 0:46:18,34
OUT A BIT OF THE INHIBITOR BUT NOT ALL OF
IT,


663
0:46:18,34 --> 0:46:21,53
EVENTUALLY YOU WILL HAVE WASHED OUT MOST OR
A LARGE


664
0:46:21,53 --> 0:46:24,31
AMOUNT OF THE INHIBITOR AND THE SEED THINKS
THAT IT IS


665
0:46:24,31 --> 0:46:26,52
TIME TO GERMINATE. AND UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES
THE


666
0:46:26,52 --> 0:46:29,29
 SEEDLING WOULD DIE BECAUSE THERE IS INADEQUATE
WATER


667
0:46:29,29 --> 0:46:32,5
FOR IT TO ESTABLISH ITSELF. BUT IN GENERAL,
THIS


668
0:46:32,5 --> 0:46:35,58
SYSTEM WORKS WELL IN TELLING THE SEED TO GERMINATE


669
0:46:35,58 --> 0:46:38,93
WHEN THERE IS AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF WATER.
FINALLY, I


670
0:46:38,93 --> 0:46:41,68
WANT TO MENTION ONE OTHER ASPECT OF SEED GERMINATION


671
0:46:41,68 --> 0:46:44,72
CONTROLLED BY ABA AND OTHER INHIBITORS. SOME
OF YOU


672
0:46:44,72 --> 0:46:47,91
MAY HAVE PURCHASED CORN BEFORE IN THE STORE
AND AFTER


673
0:46:47,91 --> 0:46:50,81
YOU OPEN THE HUSK UP AND YOU FIND THE EAR,
WHEN YOU


674
0:46:50,81 --> 0:46:54,6
LOOK INSIDE ON THE COB YOU WOULD SEE SOMETIMES
THERE


675
0:46:54,6 --> 0:46:56,7
IS SEEDS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GERMINATING. THEY
ARE


676
0:46:56,7 --> 0:46:59,65
REALLY FRUITS IN WHICH THE SEEDS GERMINATE
DIRECTLY ON


677
0:46:59,65 --> 0:47:3,9
THE COB OR THE EAR. IN THESE PARTICULAR PLANTS
FOR


678
0:47:3,9 --> 0:47:6,67
WHATEVER REASON, THEY HAVE ESCAPED DORMANCY
ON


679
0:47:6,67 --> 0:47:10,64
INHIBITION TO GERMINATION BY ABA OR OTHER
GROWTH


680
0:47:10,64 --> 0:47:13,98
REGULATORS AND WE CALL THIS PRECOCIOUS GERMINATION


681
0:47:13,98 --> 0:47:18,9
VIVIPARY. WE CALL THIS PRECOCIOUS


682
0:47:18,9 --> 0:47:25,4
GERMINATION VIVIPARY. IT IS A FAIRLY COMMON
CURRENCY


683
0:47:25,4 --> 0:47:27,97
ON MANY PLANTS AND IT USUALLY, IF YOU SEE
IT, IS


684
0:47:27,97 --> 0:47:33,64
 A CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING HAD A DAMAGE SOMEHOW
TO THE


685
0:47:33,64 --> 0:47:37,53
INHIBITION SYSTEM FOR GERMINATION. LET ME
SHOW YOU


686
0:47:37,53 --> 0:47:39,49
SOME PICTURES NOW. THE FIRST ONE IS GOING
TO JUST


687
0:47:39,49 --> 0:47:43,35
REMIND YOU OF THE COTTON BOWL AND THESE WERE
THE


688
0:47:43,35 --> 0:47:45,86
THINGS THAT FELL OFF IN JUNE THAT THE FARMER'S
THEN


689
0:47:45,86 --> 0:47:49,18
BROUGHT TO THE PEOPLE AT DAVIS TO ALLOW THEM
TO TRY


690
0:47:49,18 --> 0:47:51,43
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. HERE ARE
THE


691
0:47:51,43 --> 0:47:54,44
DORMANT BUDS. THESE ARE WHERE THE DORMIN WAS


692
0:47:54,44 --> 0:47:57,1
EXTRACTED FROM. THESE PARTICULAR BUDS SCALES
FROM THE


693
0:47:57,1 --> 0:48:0,28
OUTSIDE. AND AGAIN DORMIN AND ABA TURN OUT
TO BE THE


694
0:48:0,28 --> 0:48:4,619
SAME. HERE IS A SEEDLING GERMINATING. PRESUMABLY
THE


695
0:48:4,619 --> 0:48:7,88
SEED COAT WOULD HAVE IN IT INHIBITORS WHICH
HAVE TO BE


696
0:48:7,88 --> 0:48:12,0
REDUCED BY COLD AND THAT REDUCTION IN THE
INHIBITOR


697
0:48:12,0 --> 0:48:14,94
LEVEL TELLS THE SEED THAT IT IS TIME TO GERMINATE.


698
0:48:14,94 --> 0:48:17,24
HERE IS VIVIPARY. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE
EVER BEEN


699
0:48:17,24 --> 0:48:20,17
TO A MANGROVE SWAMP AND LOOKED AT SOME OF
THE


700
0:48:20,17 --> 0:48:22,61
MANGROVES, THESE THINGS HANGING FROM THE MANGROVES,
I


701
0:48:22,61 --> 0:48:26,14
WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF THIS NOW, THIS
