###16 SHANE SMITH: So is that why your nickname was
###18 General Butt Naked?
###19 
###22 SHANE SMITH: A lot of people would drink or do
###23 drugs before fighting?
###26 SHANE SMITH: Yeah.
###27 
###29 SHANE SMITH: So you killed the child?
###31 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Yes.
###31 SHANE SMITH: And then you drank the blood?
###33 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Yeah.
###34 
###42 MALE SPEAKER : [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###44 CROWD: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###44 MALE SPEAKER 1 : So what kind of war is this?
###45 Guerrilla?
###46 MALE SPEAKER 2 : World War III.
###47 
###59 SHANE SMITH: We here at Vice have been fascinated by
###61 Liberia for a long time.
###63 It's America's first and only foray into
###66 quasi-colonialism in Africa.
###68 It started as a back-to-Africa movement for freed slaves and,
###72 in fact, their constitution was written in Washington.
###74 And Monrovia, the capital city of Liberia, is actually named
###78 after President Monroe.
###79 It became a state in the 1840s.
###82 So the freed slaves go back to Africa and promptly enslave
###85 the native Africans based on the plantation method they had
###89 learned in the US, which lasts for about 140 years, until
###92 Samuel K. Doe, the first native African-born Liberian,
###96 was elected.
###97 But this doesn't last very long.
###99 Why?
###101 
###103 Because an American-educated--
###104 and some would say American-backed--
###106 rebel leader named Charles Taylor and his buddy, Prince
###109 Johnson, came from America and overthrew him.
###112 
###134 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###136 MALE REPORTER : Despite reports that the government
###137 wants talks with the rebels, the violence goes on.
###140 
###151 FEMALE REPORTER : Rebel forces stormed into the center of the
###152 capital today.
###154 They are now less than a mile from the executive mansion
###156 where President Samuel Doe has barricaded himself with about
###159 500 soldiers.
###161 SHANE SMITH: In fact, Prince Johnson had got to Doe before
###163 his buddy Charles, ended up torturing him, cutting him up,
###167 and is rumored to have eaten him while
###170 filming the whole thing.
###170 [SHOUTING]
###172 
###193 SHANE SMITH: So Charles Taylor finally gets elected with a
###195 campaign slogan that reads, "He killed my ma, he killed my
###198 pa, but I'll still vote for him." And it
###201 works, he gets elected.
###205 But he's so corrupt that soon after, there's a bunch of
###208 warlords fighting for control over Liberia, the country
###211 devolves into civil war, and things go from bad to
###214 severely fucked up.
###215 
###218 
###224 SHANE SMITH : But this is like a civil war on steroids.
###227 It's a post-apocalyptic Armageddon with child soldiers
###230 smoking heroin, cross-dressing cannibals, systematic rape--
###234 it's total hell on earth.
###237 [GUNFIRE]
###237 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###239 MALE SPEAKER 1: We love the music.
###239 There's the music.
###240 MALE SPEAKER 2 : They call it the sound of death.
###242 MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah, but it's the sound of music to us.
###244 SHANE SMITH: Liberia's been in the news a lot lately because
###246 Charles Taylor is on trial at The Hague for war crimes.
###248 But we wanted to know what happened to all the other
###251 warlords, so we contacted a Canadian journalist who lives
###254 in Liberia named Myles Estey, who's kind of a Kurtz-like
###257 character--
###257 tall, skinny, skeleton guy who's had malaria more times
###260 than he's had hot dinners.
###262 And he said he could get us access to all these
###264 ex-warlords.
###266 So we said, great.
###267 We got on a plane, and we flew to Liberia.
###269 
###273 [MUSIC - THE ALMIGHTY DEFENDERS, "ALL MY LOVING"]
###275 
###292 SHANE SMITH : When you first get to Monrovia, the first
###294 thing you think is, it's really hot.
###296 It's really hot, it's really poor, and
###299 it's totally chaotic.
###302 In fact, when we went to pick up Myles, he had just gotten
###305 out the hospital with malaria.
###307 He gets in the car, and he says, are you ready to go?
###309 We're going to Baboon Town in the red light district to meet
###312 our first general, General bin Laden.
###315 
###320 So as we drove to Baboon Town, we asked Myles what's up with
###323 the name, "General bin Laden?" And he said, well, a lot of
###325 the generals took different names because they didn't want
###327 to be identified after the various wars, and these
###330 pseudonyms were meant to strike terror into the hearts
###333 of their enemies.
###334 So there's a General Rambo, because he's scary, there was
###336 a General Mosquito, because mosquitoes are terrifying
###338 because they bring malaria.
###340 The general that fought General Mosquito was named
###342 General Mosquito Spray.
###344 And of course, there's General bin Laden.
###346 In fact, there's two General bin Ladens.
###348 Our General bin Laden, we found out en route, had just
###351 been put in jail.
###352 Now, he didn't know why, but he suspected because the
###355 authorities found out that we were coming with
###358 cameras to shoot him.
###360 MYLES ESTEY: And they say they're not gonna let him out,
###362 but we can interview him in the jail and we can interview
###364 the commanders.
###365 SHANE SMITH : Let's do that.
###366 Let's go then.
###367 MYLES ESTEY: Yeah.
###370 SHANE SMITH : So the minute we arrive in Baboon Town, our car
###372 is surrounded by a bunch of sketchy dudes.
###374 So when Myles came back and said we could interview bin
###376 Laden in the police station, I was like, yeah, let's get out
###379 of here and get in there really quick.
###380 
###386 So we get into the police station, and it's chaos.
###389 Some guards are saying you can go see him, other guards are
###391 saying you can't go see him, and we just have to
###393 sit there and wait.
###395 SHANE SMITH: I like being in the police station.
###398 It's nice.
###399 [MONKEY SCREECHING]
###402 SHANE SMITH: Monkey.
###403 
###406 Little monkey.
###408 He's got herpes, I think, or something.
###411 Hi.
###414 What's wrong with the monkey?
###415 Why is the monkey here?
###418 SHANE SMITH: Why is the monkey here?
###420 [MONKEY SCREECHES]
###421 SHANE SMITH: We're in a police station in the middle of the
###425 red light district to meet General bin Laden, and I'm
###429 wondering why the monkey's here.
###430 
###433 [SHANE SMITH SIGHS]
###436 SHANE SMITH : Then eventually, after sitting there for a
###438 while, we realized, oh, we've got to grease some palms.
###441 So we gave them some money and bang-- we were back into the
###444 jail and we could talk to bin Laden.
###448 Hey, bin Laden?
###449 GENERAL BIN LADEN : Yeah?
###449 SHANE SMITH : How are you?
###450 MYLES ESTEY : This is my friend, Shane.
###451 SHANE SMITH : Shane.
###451 GENERAL BIN LADEN: [INAUDIBLE].
###452 Yeah.
###452 SHANE SMITH: Nice to meet you.
###453 We're gonna try to get you out of here now, and
###456 then we can go back.
###457 
###461 SHANE SMITH: All right.
###461 We're gonna do it right now.
###462 GENERAL BIN LADEN: Now.
###462 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###467 MYLES ESTEY: Yeah, I know what he did.
###469 We're talking about to get him out, what do we have to do?
###472 MYLES ESTEY: To who?
###473 
###480 
###489 MALE SPEAKER : OK, we'll stop.
###490 We'll stop.
###490 SHANE SMITH : Video's off.
###491 OFFICER : --without the permission.
###491 MALE SPEAKER : It's off.
###492 SHANE SMITH : The video's off.
###492 He's carrying-- he's just holding it right now.
###494 
###500 MYLES ESTEY : Look, we're good people.
###501 We're good--
###503 nobody's recording anything.
###507 MYLES ESTEY : Sure, I can give him cash and--
###509 can we pay him and pay you a fine?
###511 And then take him?
###512 OFFICER : Fine.
###512 MYLES ESTEY : OK, great.
###513 OFFICER : That's good.
###513 MYLES ESTEY : OK.
###514 SHANE SMITH : OK, let's go, let's go, let's go.
###515 Let's go, let's go, let's go.
###517 OK, let's go, let's go.
###519 
###526 MALE SPEAKER: Hey, yeah-- you!
###528 SHANE SMITH: We went in there--
###530 we're being followed by the police right now.
###532 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, we might have to change tapes or do
###534 something, because--
###535 what we do is we shoot cars--
###537 MALE SPEAKER : Yeah, that's--
###537 SHANE SMITH: --and if they come, we can
###538 give them the tape.
###539 There's nothing on the tape.
###542 SHANE SMITH: Yeah.
###542 We do, right now.
###546 GENERAL BIN LADEN: We'll go to my warehouse.
###547 
###552 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###552 GENERAL BIN LADEN: Don't worry about that.
###553 
###561 SHANE SMITH: Our trip is getting progressively heavier.
###566 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, that'll be good.
###567 GENERAL BIN LADEN: We're going on top of the building.
###569 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###569 I'm kind of a little bit worried that the police are
###571 gonna come get us right now.
###573 I gave them a fake name and fake number.
###576 
###580 SHANE SMITH: OK, nice to meet you.
###582 SHANE SMITH: Nice to meet you.
###584 
###587 SHANE SMITH: Thank you.
###588 Thank you.
###589 So after we got bin Laden out of jail, he was very excited
###591 to get us up to his rooftop and tell us his story.
###594 And according to him, the ex-generals, who are now the
###596 community leaders, are the only ones doing anything to
###599 help the people.
###600 SHANE SMITH: So maybe you could explain a little bit
###603 about-- so first of all, you became known as bin Laden
###605 during the war?
###606 GENERAL BIN LADEN: During the war.
###607 SHANE SMITH: And then after the war, now you're sort of
###609 trying to help people by carpentry and by karate.
###611 GENERAL BIN LADEN: Karate.
###612 
###629 SHANE SMITH: Do you get any money here?
###632 
###635 SHANE SMITH: No, but the UN or the government doesn't give
###637 you any money?
###640 SHANE SMITH : Nothing?
###641 
###649 SHANE SMITH: And is this area-- this is red light here?
###652 GENERAL BIN LADEN: It's a red light.
###653 This is red light.
###654 SHANE SMITH: And is it--
###655 is there a lot of crime in red light?
###657 MALE SPEAKER : Oh yeah.
###657 GENERAL BIN LADEN : Yeah, it's--
###658 this is red light.
###659 SHANE SMITH : Red light.
###662 
###683 
###700 SHANE SMITH : So Myles comes over, stops the interview, and
###702 says, we have to get the fuck out of here now.
###705 Bin Laden looks down and he goes, yeah, yeah,
###707 those aren't my guys.
###708 You guys should really go.
###709 
###711 SHANE SMITH : So bin Laden gave us an escort, and a
###713 couple of his guys got us through the crowd to the car,
###716 and we got the fuck out.
###719 SHANE SMITH : So let's go.
###720 Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
###724 Holy fucking shit.
###727 That was out of hand.
###728 We gotta get out of here.
###729 
###733 There was some heavy duty Libs there, boy.
###737 So after meeting and being freaked out by General bin
###740 Laden, we wanted to see what the UN and government were
###743 doing to rebuild Liberia.
###745 We met a local journalist named Nagbe, and we asked him,
###748 and he said, you want to the government and UN are doing?
###750 I'll take you to West Point.
###752 
###758 West Point is the worst slum in Liberia, which makes it one
###760 of the worst slums in West Africa, which makes it one of
###763 the worst slums in the world.
###764 Now, when you first get there, the first thing you want to do
###767 is get the hell out.
###768 It's open sewers everywhere--
###770 shit, piss, garbage, everything mixed in--
###773 and the stench is overpowering.
###776 
###803 SHANE SMITH : Oh, dude.
###805 It really stinks here.
###806 
###816 
###819 SHANE SMITH : But, I mean, one of the first basic rules is
###822 don't shit where you eat.
###823 IMMANUEL NAGBE: That's it, but--
###824 SHANE SMITH: That's a number one rule.
###825 
###828 SHANE SMITH: But the government has to do something
###830 about that.
###831 
###837 SHANE SMITH: Mm-hmm.
###838 So even in one of the worst slums of Western Africa, you
###841 see the cultural impact that America has there.
###844 All the kids are wearing Biggie or Tupac t-shirts.
###847 In fact, one kid came up to us and said, hey, I'm a rapper.
###850 Can I rap for you?
###851 And we said yes.
###852 And it wasn't about bling, and it wasn't about Cristal.
###856 
###890 SHANE SMITH: And is there a lot of malaria in here?
###893 SHANE SMITH : Needless to say, in West Point, health
###895 conditions are foul.
###896 Disease is everywhere--
###898 malaria, infections, and AIDS are rampant.
###901 
###911 
###914 SHANE SMITH : Cover up for heroin.
###916 SHANE SMITH : Wow.
###916 IMMANUEL NAGBE: So a big business.
###917 SHANE SMITH: We heard stories that during the war, the
###920 rebels would go out in boats with diamonds and trade the
###923 diamonds for weapons and cocaine, and there was a lot
###926 of Colombians and Mexicans.
###929 SHANE SMITH: We find it interesting because cocaine
###932 and heroin are very expensive drugs, and so we were
###934 surprised to find heroin here.
###935 Usually in poorer countries, there's speed or meth or
###939 things you can make.
###941 SHANE SMITH: Why is that?
###944 [BABY CRYING]
###950 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###951 
###956 
###967 MALE SPEAKER : You got to smoke this up.
###968 
###982 MALE SPEAKER : [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###985 
###992 MALE SPEAKER : [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###995 MALE SPEAKER : [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###998 
###1014 
###1028 
###1039 
###1049 SHANE SMITH: Liberian dollars or--
###1050 IMMANUEL NAGBE: Liberian dollars.
###1051 SHANE SMITH: So how much is that?
###1053 SHANE SMITH : So because of the poverty, a lot of women
###1055 have to become prostitutes?
###1056 IMMANUEL NAGBE: Yes.
###1057 
###1060 SHANE SMITH: Sex worker.
###1061 IMMANUEL NAGBE: We can go this way.
###1063 
###1080 
###1084 SHANE SMITH: No, you can just show it to us.
###1086 
###1089 
###1097 
###1102 
###1105 
###1109 
###1116 SHANE SMITH : The legacy of civil war in Liberia is
###1119 staggering.
###1120 It's the fourth-poorest country in the world.
###1122 50% of the country is illiterate, 70% of the female
###1127 population has been raped, 80% of the population is
###1131 unemployed, and a large percentage of the population
###1134 has eaten human flesh.
###1136 MALE SPEAKER: It tastes like real meat.
###1138 If you taste it, you'd like to eat it every day.
###1141 You want to see some piece?
###1142 
###1145 
###1172 SHANE SMITH : Now one of the warlords responsible for these
###1174 atrocities, who fought in all three civil wars, is a guy
###1177 named General Rambo, who we picked up at a market.
###1180 He said, I'll talk to you if you take me to the old
###1183 headquarters of the rebel factions outside of town.
###1186 
###1189 
###1192 SHANE SMITH : When did the hotel stop working?
###1196 SHANE SMITH : Because of the war.
###1196 GENERAL RAMBO : When the war came.
###1197 SHANE SMITH : Yeah.
###1198 
###1228 SHANE SMITH : Yeah.
###1229 GENERAL RAMBO: Yes, it happened.
###1230 
###1242 SHANE SMITH: So you were one of the ones that came in to
###1244 take out Taylor?
###1245 GENERAL RAMBO: Yes.
###1246 SHANE SMITH : And then, at one point, the American government
###1248 came to try to get you to go to Iraq?
###1250 
###1258 SHANE SMITH: Yeah.
###1260 
###1264 SHANE SMITH: American.
###1265 
###1272 SHANE SMITH : Yeah.
###1275 And so when there was Iraq, it was like, OK, let's go.
###1278 We can help.
###1279 So what happened?
###1282 SHANE SMITH : The government wouldn't let you go?
###1283 
###1286 SHANE SMITH: Do you think it's a problem that you have all
###1288 these ex-combatants who grew up fighting-- you fought in
###1291 three wars--
###1293 they have no money, they have no job, and
###1295 isn't that a problem?
###1296 GENERAL RAMBO: It's a big problem.
###1297 
###1333 SHANE SMITH: So they're still there with the guns?
###1335 GENERAL RAMBO: Yeah, they're still there with the guns.
###1337 The war is hot.
###1338 
###1342 SHANE SMITH : So if the rebel forces wanted, they could take
###1344 over tomorrow?
###1346 SHANE SMITH: Two or three hours?
###1347 GENERAL RAMBO: Sure.
###1348 SHANE SMITH: Wow.
###1349 
###1361 SHANE SMITH : And do you think there's a
###1362 possibility of that happening?
###1364 GENERAL RAMBO: Yes.
###1366 
###1373 SHANE SMITH : So what Rambo is saying is, there's still
###1375 plenty of guns in Liberia, and him, or someone like him, can
###1379 take over Monrovia in two hours if the UN leaves, and
###1382 the UN is scheduled to leave next year.
###1385 
###1389 And as we said our goodbyes to Rambo, we told him we were
###1392 going back to West Point.
###1396 SHANE SMITH : Yeah?
###1397 
###1405 SHANE SMITH: Cannibalism, chaos, killing, rape,
###1407 everything.
###1407 GENERAL RAMBO : Everything.
###1409 
###1416 SHANE SMITH : A few years ago, we did an article in Vice
###1418 Magazine called "General Butt Naked Versus the Tupac Army,"
###1421 about a particularly fierce Liberian warlord called Butt
###1424 Naked who fought naked, his child soldiers fought naked,
###1427 and they were cannibals.
###1429 So we asked Rambo if he knew him by chance, and he said, in
###1432 fact, we're from the same tribe, I know him well.
###1434 He promised to set up an interview while we did our
###1437 follow-up in the brothels of West Point.
###1439 
###1445 [CAR HONKING]
###1447 SHANE SMITH: Driving into West Point at
###1449 night is pretty freaky.
###1450 There's no electricity grid in Monrovia, so it's pitch black.
###1453 
###1468 SHANE SMITH: Hit it on the wall.
###1469 Hit it on the wall.
###1470 So this is the craziest, fucking scariest
###1472 drive ever down here.
###1473 We got a little bit lost in the port, and you couldn't see
###1476 anything, there's no electricity.
###1477 And then you just see people wandering around, fucking
###1480 shit, piss--
###1481 fucking yelling at us, we want money, we want money.
###1484 Now there's no lights in here.
###1485 We're gonna go in here, this is the brothel.
###1490 We're gonna see what's going on.
###1493 Hello.
###1494 How are you?
###1497 A lot of dudes are coming in now, it's crazy.
###1502 I don't know where we're going.
###1503 MALE SPEAKER : Straight.
###1504 SHANE SMITH: Straight.
###1505 
###1508 Wow.
###1510 That room looks--
###1511 
###1516 MALE SPEAKER : Now we're in chalet number five.
###1517 SHANE SMITH: I don't know what happens in here, but I don't
###1519 want to know.
###1520 Wow.
###1521 What the fuck goes on in here, dude?
###1524 Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
###1526 
###1531 Well, we were here a little bit earlier.
###1534 There was used condoms and bloodstained sheets, and now
###1536 they've sort of done it up.
###1538 So we're gonna interview some of the girls, see what they
###1541 have to say.
###1542 
###1546 We have a code for when something's freaky.
###1550 We go, "It's gnar gnar." Gnar gnar.
###1557 SHANE SMITH : One of the things we had heard since we
###1558 arrived in Liberia was about the alleged sexual misconduct
###1561 by the UN staff, so we asked the girls at the
###1564 brothel about it.
###1565 
###1570 
###1580 
###1585 
###1589 IMMANUEL NAGBE: OK, paradise.
###1591 FEMALE SPEAKER: I wanted to get me a job.
###1593 IMMANUEL NAGBE: Yeah.
###1594 FEMALE SPEAKER: For myself.
###1595 IMMANUEL NAGBE: What sort of work do you do
###1596 in West Point now?
###1598 IMMANUEL NAGBE: OK.
###1599 
###1601 IMMANUEL NAGBE: All right.
###1602 
###1609 IMMANUEL NAGBE: OK.
###1611 
###1621 IMMANUEL NAGBE: OK.
###1621 FEMALE SPEAKER: Now.
###1622 IMMANUEL NAGBE: All right.
###1623 We were talking-- listen to me.
###1626 IMMANUEL NAGBE: Listen to me and sit down.
###1627 Now listen.
###1628 IMMANUEL NAGBE: Listen.
###1629 
###1647 SHANE SMITH : As soon as the girl started screaming, a
###1649 bunch of heads popped into the room.
###1651 And then when she started screaming about money,
###1653 everyone's going, money, money,
###1654 money, where's the money?
###1655 And at that point, Nagbe said to us, you'd better get the
###1658 hell out of here.
###1658 So we sort of took off through the tangled alleyways and just
###1661 tried to get back to the car.
###1664 SHANE SMITH: We're getting the fuck out here right now.
###1666 And when we got to the car, our driver-- who was also
###1668 supposed to be our security-- was so freaked out that he
###1670 peeled out and nearly hit a group of people that had
###1673 surrounded the car.
###1676 SHANE SMITH : And if you hit a group of people down deep in
###1678 West Point, that was it.
###1679 It was a death sentence.
###1680 They would have tore us apart.
###1681 [CAR HONKING]
###1682 
###1708 SHANE SMITH : And to make things even freakier, as we're
###1710 pulling out of West Point, Rambo texts Myles and says,
###1713 not only does Butt Naked want to do the interview, but that
###1716 he's waiting at our hotel for us.
###1718 Yeah, now we're going back to sanity, to hang out with an
###1722 ex-cannibal and multi-murderer, who's now
###1725 staying at our hotel and decided not to leave.
###1728 Because they were there-- they want us to hang out.
###1731 Meanwhile, he knows I have tons of money, and he's on the
###1734 run because people want to kill him.
###1736 Should I just leave my door open, General?
###1739 Do you want to come in?
###1740 
###1746 
###1760 SHANE SMITH : Now we are very nervous to meet General Butt
###1763 Naked, and he's very nervous to meet us, because he's had
###1766 several assassination attempts against him.
###1768 He wants to meet us and vet us before he'll OK an interview.
###1772 
###1775 When we told him about our escape from West Point that
###1777 night, he laughed, and he seemed to ease up.
###1780 After that, he asked for a phone, he called
###1782 Rambo, and it was on.
###1785 JOSHUA BLAHYI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1787 GENERAL RAMBO : Yeah?
###1788 JOSHUA BLAHYI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1792 
###1797 
###1803 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Yeah, some white guys.
###1805 They are good guys.
###1806 The guy's a good guy, man.
###1809 Tell the boss lady hi, yeah?
###1811 
###1816 
###1822 
###1830 SHANE SMITH : We asked the general, now known as Joshua
###1831 Blahyi, why people were trying to kill him, and he told us
###1835 that it was because he had been recently pardoned for his
###1837 war crimes.
###1838 And when we asked how he got pardoned, he told us it was
###1842 his conversion to Christ and his becoming a man of God.
###1845 
###1866 
###1886 SHANE SMITH : So we talked with Joshua late into the
###1888 night, until he told us to get to bed because the next day he
###1891 was going to show us his Liberia.
###1893 
###1902 [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1921 
###1926 SHANE SMITH: In the morning, Joshua Blahyi took us out, and
###1928 the first stop was the area within Monrovia that he used
###1932 to control during the war.
###1934 
###1939 SHANE SMITH : And who would be attacking?
###1940 
###1965 SHANE SMITH: Alive?
###1965 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Yes.
###1966 
###1970 SHANE SMITH: And what does that do?
###1971 
###2049 SHANE SMITH : The next stop was the place where there had
###2051 been an assassination attempt on Joshua's life
###2054 just the day before.
###2056 
###2060 SHANE SMITH : And he just-- he hit you and then ran?
###2062 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Yeah.
###2063 Yeah.
###2064 
###2092 SHANE SMITH : You jumped over the car?
###2093 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Yeah, jumped over the car.
###2094 
###2100 SHANE SMITH : And who do you think it was?
###2103 
###2106 SHANE SMITH : Hurt a lot of people in the war?
###2108 JOSHUA BLAHYI: In the war.
###2109 
###2115 SHANE SMITH : Next, Joshua wanted to show us his mission
###2117 in the country, where he was
###2119 rehabilitating ex-child soldiers.
###2121 
###2148 SHANE SMITH : And are there are a lot of people who fought
###2150 during the war that can't get rid of the violence?
###2153 JOSHUA BLAHYI: It's very hard.
###2154 SHANE SMITH: Very hard.
###2154 JOSHUA BLAHYI: It takes time to get rid of the violence.
###2156 SHANE SMITH: Yeah.
###2157 How did you get rid of the violence?
###2159 
###2170 SHANE SMITH: Yeah.
###2172 SHANE SMITH : OK.
###2173 
###2178 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Come, you can look at--
###2180 come, come and see.
###2182 SHANE SMITH: Nobody brought bug juice.
###2185 [LAUGHING]
###2193 SHANE SMITH: No, no, no, no.
###2194 It's OK.
###2194 Well, I don't mind getting wet.
###2198 
###2203 SHANE SMITH : About a million people in Africa die every
###2205 year from malaria, and malaria thrives in swamps
###2208 exactly like this.
###2212 SHANE SMITH: It's very sploochly on my moochly.
###2214 
###2218 Thanks.
###2218 Good.
###2220 
###2227 Hello.
###2227 MALE SPEAKER: Hello.
###2228 
###2231 
###2235 SHANE SMITH: This is what all fear stems from.
###2239 Thank you.
###2239 So these were some of the boys that you fought
###2242 with before, or no?
###2243 
###2248 SHANE SMITH: Yeah.
###2249 So is that why your nickname was General Butt Naked?
###2251 
###2254 SHANE SMITH: A lot of people would drink or do
###2255 drugs before fighting?
###2257 
###2261 SHANE SMITH: So you killed the child--
###2263 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Yes.
###2264 SHANE SMITH: --and then you drank the blood?
###2265 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Yeah.
###2266 SHANE SMITH : Now why would you fight naked?
###2268 
###2280 [MEN SINGING]
###2287 SHANE SMITH: This is his mission that they're building.
###2290 They're singing now.
###2292 MALE SPEAKERS : [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###2294 
###2332 JOSHUA BLAHYI : Welcome to our home.
###2333 SHANE SMITH : Thank you.
###2336 
###2340 SHANE SMITH: So you fought for Charles Taylor and--
###2343 SHANE SMITH: Johnson.
###2344 So you were enemies before?
###2346 JOSHUA BLAHYI : Yeah, we're enemies.
###2347 SHANE SMITH : Yeah.
###2348 
###2394 
###2447 SHANE SMITH : Where are we right now?
###2449 
###2454 SHANE SMITH: Cemetery.
###2455 
###2462 SHANE SMITH: So this is the cemetery where, after the war,
###2465 there was nowhere to live, so the people would come in,
###2469 empty out the graves, and live in the graves.
###2473 Maybe up to about 4,000 people lived in the graves.
###2479 SHANE SMITH: It's a very heavy vibe.
###2481 Empty graves everywhere.
###2484 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###2490 SHANE SMITH: We were just at lunch, we were talking about--
###2493 we ordered some ribs, and you said, "No, I don't like to
###2497 eat--"
###2497 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Flesh.
###2498 SHANE SMITH: "--flesh." And I said, "Why don't you like to
###2500 eat flesh?" And you told me the story about coming back
###2502 from Nigeria.
###2502 Could you tell us that story?
###2504 
###2538 SHANE SMITH: You were eating human flesh?
###2540 
###2549 SHANE SMITH : What would you eat?
###2550 
###2558 SHANE SMITH : Yeah.
###2559 JOSHUA BLAHYI : Yeah.
###2561 SHANE SMITH : Yeah.
###2564 OK.
###2566 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Yeah.
###2567 SHANE SMITH: We're talking about eating
###2568 human flesh in a graveyard.
###2568 It's a bit weird.
###2571 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Yeah.
###2571 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###2573 So we can go.
###2574

###2729 Amen.
###2730 
###2815 [APPLAUSE]
###2819 [MUSIC PLAYING, SINGING]
###2840 SHANE SMITH : Liberia, on the one hand, has more crime and
###2842 poverty and rape and cannibalism
###2844 than you've ever seen.
###2845 But on the other, it's also got a church on every street
###2848 corner, every car has a religious slogan, they have
###2851 huge revivals with tens of thousands of worshipers.
###2854 It's some sort of weird heaven-and-hell scenario.

###2866 
###2870 [CHEERING]
###2874 FEMALE SPEAKER : [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###2875 [MUSIC PLAYING, SINGING]
###2885 SHANE SMITH : While hanging out with Joshua, I started to
###2886 get a bit of Stockholm syndrome, because he's
###2889 charming, the churches are nice,
###2891 there's not as much danger.
###2893 And I started to like him.
###2895 [MUSIC PLAYING, SINGING]
###2901 SHANE SMITH : But as he was preaching, I thought to
###2902 myself, this guy has killed tens of thousands of people.
###2906 In fact, he's probably killed the relatives of the people in
###2909 the church worshipping and adoring him now.
###2912 And I'm thinking to myself, what the fuck is going on?
###2915 [MUSIC PLAYING, SINGING]
###2930 FEMALE SPEAKER : Hallelujah!
###2931 FEMALE SPEAKERS : Amen!
###2933 
###2995 [APPLAUSE]
###2998 SHANE SMITH: I just want to say thank you for having me in
###3001 your church.
###3002 Praise God.
###3003 And I'd like to say thank you to Joshua Blahyi for all the
###3009 good work he's doing.
###3010 Hopefully, we can help, and hopefully, we can show what
###3013 we're doing here in Liberia, what you're doing in Liberia,
###3016 and we can help make it better and bring more awareness to
###3020 what's happened here.
###3020 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Amen.
###3021 [APPLAUSE]
###3026 SHANE SMITH : I have to admit that when Joshua handed me the
###3027 mic, I had no idea what I was saying.
###3030 At that point in the trip, I felt like I was on acid.
###3033 
###3103 [APPLAUSE]
###3107 [MUSIC PLAYING, SINGING]
###3138 JOSHUA BLAHYI: [SINGING]
###3138 I worship you because of who you are.
###3144 [MUSIC - THE ALMIGHTY DEFENDERS, "ALL MY LOVING"]
###3145 
###3159 SHANE SMITH : And as I sat and listened to Joshua preach, I
###3161 thought about the fact that the UN is leaving in less than
###3163 a year, and Rambo had told us that the generals
###3166 are ready to fight.
###3167 They have the soldiers, they have the guns, and they're
###3169 living in abject poverty.
###3172 And I wondered if that happened, would Joshua stay
###3175 with God, or would he return to being General Butt Naked?
###3180 
###3192 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Somebody shout "Glory!"
###3194 CONGREGATION : Glory!
###3195 
###3198 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Let us pray.
