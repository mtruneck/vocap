0:0:0,43 --> 0:0:1,7
ANDREW GREEN: Today we
catch up with Drake.


3
0:0:1,7 --> 0:0:3,83
We hear about one of the
craziest nights Nas has ever


4
0:0:3,83 --> 0:0:4,65
experienced.


5
0:0:4,65 --> 0:0:6,86
And we explore the weird corners
of the World Wide Web.


6
0:0:6,86 --> 0:0:15,97



7
0:0:15,97 --> 0:0:16,6
NAS: Yo, what up?


8
0:0:16,6 --> 0:0:20,37
This is Nas, and this like a
crazy party, crazy thing I


9
0:0:20,37 --> 0:0:23,2
remember from back
in the days.


10
0:0:23,2 --> 0:0:27,9
I went to a party in the city
for the Shaft movie premier


11
0:0:27,9 --> 0:0:29,1
with Samuel Jackson--


12
0:0:29,1 --> 0:0:32,6
New York City nightclub.


13
0:0:32,6 --> 0:0:35,63
All of the sudden, I'm in the
middle of Wesley Snipes and


14
0:0:35,63 --> 0:0:37,7
Grace Jones.


15
0:0:37,7 --> 0:0:38,66
Wesley had on black.


16
0:0:38,66 --> 0:0:40,4
And he was chilling.


17
0:0:40,4 --> 0:0:42,83
And Grace was chilling--
very beautiful.


18
0:0:42,83 --> 0:0:47,16
Grace Jones knocked my drink on
my arm, and some of it got


19
0:0:47,16 --> 0:0:48,43
on her arm.


20
0:0:48,43 --> 0:0:49,28
She's didn't see me there.


21
0:0:49,28 --> 0:0:50,7
She just did it by mistake.


22
0:0:50,7 --> 0:0:52,6
And I looked.


23
0:0:52,6 --> 0:0:53,45
She looked at me.


24
0:0:53,45 --> 0:0:56,5
She grabbed me and she--


25
0:0:56,5 --> 0:0:58,22
her arm, it was sleeveless.


26
0:0:58,22 --> 0:1:1,12
She looked at her arm where the
drink had fell and just


27
0:1:1,12 --> 0:1:4,29
licked her arm where
the drink had fell.


28
0:1:4,29 --> 0:1:5,99
And I was a few things--


29
0:1:5,99 --> 0:1:9,375
I was starstruck, turned
on, I thought I was in


30
0:1:9,375 --> 0:1:10,32
the Twilight Zone.


31
0:1:10,32 --> 0:1:12,83
And she probably didn't
even who I was.


32
0:1:12,83 --> 0:1:13,72
But I knew who she is--


33
0:1:13,72 --> 0:1:14,64
I'm a fan.


34
0:1:14,64 --> 0:1:16,23
And someone else grabbed me.


35
0:1:16,23 --> 0:1:17,14
It's Wesley Snipes.


36
0:1:17,14 --> 0:1:19,31
Oh shit, he pushed me.


37
0:1:19,31 --> 0:1:22,48
And he's asked me: are you
a rapper or a scientist?


38
0:1:22,48 --> 0:1:25,37
And I'm like damn, Wesley Snipes
pushed me kinda hard,


39
0:1:25,37 --> 0:1:28,1
like, that's Wesley and
everything, but he's pushing


40
0:1:28,1 --> 0:1:30,9
me, like, what's going on?


41
0:1:30,9 --> 0:1:33,39
"I said, are you a rapper or a
scientist?" And I'm like damn,


42
0:1:33,39 --> 0:1:37,1
Wesley Snipes is about to do
some Blade shit to me.


43
0:1:37,1 --> 0:1:38,43
So I pushed him back.


44
0:1:38,43 --> 0:1:39,13
Boom!


45
0:1:39,13 --> 0:1:41,8
And I said, you won't make it
out of here alive, man.


46
0:1:41,8 --> 0:1:45,95
Wesley realized, why
am I pushing Nas?


47
0:1:45,95 --> 0:1:49,4
And I'm like like, why am
I pushing back Wesley?


48
0:1:49,4 --> 0:1:51,18
And where's Grace Jones at?


49
0:1:51,18 --> 0:1:54,82
It was just a weird little
moment right there, so.


50
0:1:54,82 --> 0:1:57,65
And that was some crazy-ass
shit from back in the days


51
0:1:57,65 --> 0:1:58,81
around the way.


52
0:1:58,81 --> 0:2:1,79
Love those days.


53
0:2:1,79 --> 0:2:3,94
ANDREW GREEN: I thought Wesley
Snipes was in prison.


54
0:2:3,94 --> 0:2:6,81
Next up, we check back in with
our real-life Muppet, Hanson


55
0:2:6,81 --> 0:2:9,13
O'Haver, for another installment
of, "What's Up


56
0:2:9,13 --> 0:2:10,389
With Drake?"


57
0:2:10,389 --> 0:2:11,53
HANSON O'HAVER: I'm
Hanson O'Haver.


58
0:2:11,53 --> 0:2:16,37
This is "What's Up
with Drake."


59
0:2:16,37 --> 0:2:18,75
So I'd like to take some time
today to address what's kind


60
0:2:18,75 --> 0:2:21,55
of the most common criticism of
Drake, which is that he has


61
0:2:21,55 --> 0:2:24,35
no sense of humor
about himself.


62
0:2:24,35 --> 0:2:26,52
And you know, I don't know Drake
personally, so for all I


63
0:2:26,52 --> 0:2:29,28
know he could be a perfectly
modest and just


64
0:2:29,28 --> 0:2:30,91
affable young man.


65
0:2:30,91 --> 0:2:33,77
But I'll agree that the way he
presents himself is as someone


66
0:2:33,77 --> 0:2:35,37
who takes himself
too seriously.


67
0:2:35,37 --> 0:2:38,6
For example, he tweets things
like, "I don't have an


68
0:2:38,6 --> 0:2:41,58
addictive personality, but I'm
hooked on it." Or, like, posts


69
0:2:41,58 --> 0:2:44,5
ridiculous photos of himself
on his own blog.


70
0:2:44,5 --> 0:2:46,78
And in any normal situation this
would take away from an


71
0:2:46,78 --> 0:2:48,33
artist's charm.


72
0:2:48,33 --> 0:2:52,6
We like people that are
kind of self-effacing.


73
0:2:52,6 --> 0:2:53,945
And musicians who take
themselves really seriously


74
0:2:53,945 --> 0:2:54,99
are the worst.


75
0:2:54,99 --> 0:2:58,47
For example, think of Creed,
or, like, Bono with this


76
0:2:58,47 --> 0:3:1,56
tinted sunglasses and his arms
spread like a sort of rock and


77
0:3:1,56 --> 0:3:2,55
roll Jesus.


78
0:3:2,55 --> 0:3:5,55
Every once in a while due to a
combination of synergy, and


79
0:3:5,55 --> 0:3:8,86
luck, and whatever else, for
a brief period of time,


80
0:3:8,86 --> 0:3:11,62
everything that a musician
does is flawless.


81
0:3:11,62 --> 0:3:14,47
And during this period, if
they were to present


82
0:3:14,47 --> 0:3:16,96
themselves in a
less-than-serious manner, it


83
0:3:16,96 --> 0:3:20,55
would only take away
from their charm.


84
0:3:20,55 --> 0:3:22,99
For example, think of Prince's
Purple Rain.


85
0:3:22,99 --> 0:3:24,98
Everyone agrees that
it's amazing.


86
0:3:24,98 --> 0:3:26,71
But it's also totally insane.


87
0:3:26,71 --> 0:3:29,64
Yet if Prince were to
acknowledge this and to, sort


88
0:3:29,64 --> 0:3:32,96
of, wink at his audience and
say, hey guys, I know that you


89
0:3:32,96 --> 0:3:35,84
guys know that this is totally
silly, the whole thing would


90
0:3:35,84 --> 0:3:36,81
have been ruined.


91
0:3:36,81 --> 0:3:39,6
I think that right now we've
reached this sort of "peak


92
0:3:39,6 --> 0:3:41,67
Drake," where everything that
he does is amazing--


93
0:3:41,67 --> 0:3:45,3
from his albums, to his videos,
to his guest spot on


94
0:3:45,3 --> 0:3:46,18
the new Meek Millz song.


95
0:3:46,18 --> 0:3:48,77
And as long as he continues in
this manner, there's no reason


96
0:3:48,77 --> 0:3:50,98
that he needs to present himself
as anything less than


97
0:3:50,98 --> 0:3:54,45
just a totally serious guy
making serious music about his


98
0:3:54,45 --> 0:3:55,7
really serious emotions.


99
0:3:55,7 --> 0:4:0,65



100
0:4:0,65 --> 0:4:2,33
ANDREW GREEN: Why do I have
this weird feeling that


101
0:4:2,33 --> 0:4:4,2
Drake's going to steal Hanson
from Vice just to


102
0:4:4,2 --> 0:4:5,85
become his hype man?


103
0:4:5,85 --> 0:4:8,42
And finally, we check back in
with our buddy Thomas Morton,


104
0:4:8,42 --> 0:4:11,58
a Dickens character that time
forgot, to get his take on all


105
0:4:11,58 --> 0:4:13,79
of the shit that we waste our
lives on instead of getting


106
0:4:13,79 --> 0:4:15,14
anything productive done.


107
0:4:15,14 --> 0:4:19,1
It's time for another episode
of "Whatcha Watching?"


108
0:4:19,1 --> 0:4:21,209
THOMAS MORTON: Hi, welcome
to the Vice offices.


109
0:4:21,209 --> 0:4:23,37
As you can see, everybody here
is doing a very good job


110
0:4:23,37 --> 0:4:24,69
looking busy.


111
0:4:24,69 --> 0:4:26,28
They're all at computers,
though, which means what


112
0:4:26,28 --> 0:4:28,58
they're actually doing is,
basically, what you're doing--


113
0:4:28,58 --> 0:4:30,51
screwing around on
the internet.


114
0:4:30,51 --> 0:4:32,72
I work on a computer, too.


115
0:4:32,72 --> 0:4:35,49
I'm no stranger to
YouTube links.


116
0:4:35,49 --> 0:4:37,75
And so I've decided to put
together a few of my favorites


117
0:4:37,75 --> 0:4:38,73
from this week.


118
0:4:38,73 --> 0:4:41,47
So come enjoy the cream
of the crap.


119
0:4:41,47 --> 0:4:45,26



120
0:4:45,26 --> 0:4:48,1
Hey, so it's been
a little bit.


121
0:4:48,1 --> 0:4:50,9
I thought we'd play
a little catch-up.


122
0:4:50,9 --> 0:4:52,82
This first video is actually,
I think, the first video I


123
0:4:52,82 --> 0:4:54,42
watched on the internet.


124
0:4:54,42 --> 0:4:55,61
It's a short and quick one.


125
0:4:55,61 --> 0:4:58,28
It's titled "Burrito Punch." A
tormented, heavy-set, Angus


126
0:4:58,28 --> 0:5:1,98
kind of kid is pelted with a
burrito and then exacts really


127
0:5:1,98 --> 0:5:4,972
quick schoolyard justice.


128
0:5:4,972 --> 0:5:6,355
MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh shit.


129
0:5:6,355 --> 0:5:7,74
MALE SPEAKER 2: What
the hell, man?


130
0:5:7,74 --> 0:5:9,39
ANDREW GREEN: So, continuing
on the sort of ad hoc theme


131
0:5:9,39 --> 0:5:13,91
we've got going of justice and
comeuppance is a stark


132
0:5:13,91 --> 0:5:16,76
morality play called "The Story
of Mr. Dollar." Mr.


133
0:5:16,76 --> 0:5:20,59
Dollar, as you can see, is kind
of a ramshackle dollar


134
0:5:20,59 --> 0:5:22,31
store operation out
in Bushwick.


135
0:5:22,31 --> 0:5:25,78
And here you see its owner doing
a less-than-effective


136
0:5:25,78 --> 0:5:29,53
job cleaning up standing
rainwater on its roof.


137
0:5:29,53 --> 0:5:33,575
And in a moment of Buster
Keaton-esque comedic timing,


138
0:5:33,575 --> 0:5:39,68
you can see the ladder raises
and marches off frame.


139
0:5:39,68 --> 0:5:43,63
So the second part takes place a
month later and is basically


140
0:5:43,63 --> 0:5:46,79
a static shot of the damage
that the standing water he


141
0:5:46,79 --> 0:5:50,6
never fully removed from his
room has done, which has


142
0:5:50,6 --> 0:5:52,145
basically destroyed
his business.

is turned on its head by

little nerdlinger.

turns out to be a varsity

just happens to be a

think they sell to model
airplanes enthusiasts this set


184
0:7:24,52 --> 0:7:30,91
to the tune of the moon level
from NES's Duck Tales, adding


185
0:7:30,91 --> 0:7:34,41
a twinge of nostalgia to the
general air of serenity that


186

this should instill in you.
