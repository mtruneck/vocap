###131 [APPLAUSE]
###133 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###143 [APPLAUSE]
###166 JOE WENGERT: Thanks a lot, guys.
###170 Welcome to UCB Comedy, live from the YouTube space.
###175 How you guys feeling tonight?
###176 
###181 We're here tonight as a part of Comedy Week.
###183 I don't know about you guys.
###184 I can't believe it's Comedy Week already.
###186 The year went by so quickly.
###188 JON GABRUS: I feel like it was just drama week weeks ago.
###190 JOE WENGERT: I know.
###192 I just took down all my Comedy Week decorations, and now here
###195 we are celebrating it once again.
###198 We're performers from the Upright Citizens Brigade
###201 theatre in Los Angeles.
###202 And what we're going to be doing tonight for you is
###205 improv comedy.
###206 We're going to be watching real YouTube videos.
###209 And that's going to serve as the inspiration for comedy
###212 scenes that we're going to make up on the spot.
###214 They've never been seen before.
###217 And they will never be seen again.
###220 I mean, you can go back and rewatch it again.
###223 But in theory, we're not going to do them again.
###226 Are you guys excited about that?
###228 [APPLAUSE]
###236 Improv is all about the ensemble and about the group,
###240 so now let's take some time to introduce ourselves
###242 individually as performers.
###246 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Hi, I'm Mike Leffingwell.
###247 
###251 TONI RAMOS: Hey, guys.
###252 I'm Toni Ramos.
###253 
###257 JOE WENGERT: Hi, everybody.
###258 I was already talking.
###259 My name's Joe Wengert.
###260 
###263 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Hi, Drew DiFonzo Marks.
###265 
###270 JON GABRUS: One guy loved it.
###272 I am Jon Gabrus.
###274 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, my god.
###275 
###280 ALLAN MCLEOD: And I'm the last one.
###281 I'm Allan McLeod.
###282 How's it going?
###283 [APPLAUSE]
###287 JOE WENGERT: OK.
###287 Now that you know our first and last names,
###290 it's time to do improv.
###293 Let's roll the first YouTube clip.
###295 
###300 CRAZYPUERTORRICAN99: Cartoon Network, you have
###304 fucking done it again.
###305 I am sick of it.
###307 Cartoon Network, I am just sick of this.
###312 OK.
###315 You cancel "Young Justice" and "Green Lantern," the only
###318 reason to watch Cartoon Network right now.
###322 OK?
###324 And this happened before. "Toonami--" you know
###327 "Toonami." That got canceled for low ratings.
###331 OK.
###332 But this was the only thing that was worth watching on
###336 Cartoon Network.
###337 
###342 They just-- why do they do that?
###346 Hell, Boomerang has better shows.
###349 Disney Channel has now better shows, and that
###352 has a lot to say.
###353 Cartoon Network, what the fuck is wrong?
###357 
###362 You guys just can't keep doing this.
###367 "Toonami," childhood ruined.
###371 "DC Nation--" "DC Nation" is a one hour block.
###373 It should be more.
###377 This could have been the new "Toonami," but just with
###379 superhero shows.
###381 They could have had three hours.
###382 Like they could have had two hours of the new shows and
###386 like one hour of the classics, like
###390 "Teen Titans," or "Batman--
###391 The Animated Series," "Justice League Unlimited." But OK, to
###397 do this again?
###400 Nah.
###401 I'm just sick and tired of this shit.
###405 You know what, Cartoon Network?
###407 The only think I'm watching right now is Adult Swim.
###410 And that's because of "Toonami." It's only because
###415 of "Toonami," and I only watch it on Saturdays.
###420 Get that through your fucking skulls and
###424 just stop doing this.
###428 That's all.
###429 Stay cool.
###430 Bang.
###431 
###434 [APPLAUSE]
###436 JOE WENGERT: OK.
###437 So, we all watched that video for the first time with the
###440 rest of you, right now.
###442 And we're going to use that video as the inspiration for
###444 some improvised scenes.
###447 [APPLAUSE]
###452 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Excuse me.
###453 Are you the manager of this McDonald's?
###454 TONI RAMOS: Uh, yes sir, I am.
###456 How can I help you?
###457 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh, you can help me by
###458 answering this question.
###459 TONI RAMOS: OK, great.
###460 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Where the fuck is the McRib?
###463 
###466 Where is it?
###468 TONI RAMOS: Sir, the McRib is a limited time thing.
###471 It's in the month of June, so it'll be
###473 coming up in a few weeks.
###475 If you can come--
###476 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh, OK.
###476 Hey, yeah, yeah.
###477 No, I got a great idea.
###478 Why don't we only have sunshine in the month of June,
###481 and it's total darkness for the other 11
###483 months of the year?
###485 Why are you fucking America?
###487 
###490 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Hi, can I get a
###491 number four, super sized?
###493 And instead of a soft drink, can I get a Shamrock shake?
###497 TONI RAMOS: Oh, sorry.
###498 We don't have Shamrock shakes.
###499 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Go fuck yourself.
###503 TONI RAMOS: It's been a rough day, sir.
###504 
###507 ALLAN MCLEOD: I've been looking around
###508 the Playland area.
###511 TONI RAMOS: Oh, great.
###512 Yeah.
###515 Did you lose a kid?
###516 Or are you--
###517 ALLAN MCLEOD: I think you guys lost Grimace.
###520 Where the fuck is Grimace?
###523 Where's my big purple man?
###527 TONI RAMOS: Sir, that's just an action figure.
###531 He's not like a real guy running around.
###533 He's just like a--
###534 ALLAN MCLEOD: What?
###534 What's wrong with you?
###537 JOE WENGERT: OK.
###538 Toni, we've heard your complaints, and--
###540 TONI RAMOS: I mean, they are rough.
###542 So many guys have told me to go fuck myself, that I'm an
###546 idiot, threw out the C-word.
###548 JOE WENGERT: Look, these products
###549 are seasonal products.
###551 There's no way that we can offer them
###552 throughout the year.
###553 The best that I can do for you is give you this handgun, OK?
###557 If someone is especially irate about the fact that they can't
###561 get a specific--
###562 JON GABRUS: I'll have--
###563 TONI RAMOS: Pow.
###565 
###568 JON GABRUS: Come on!
###568 Ow.
###570 JOE WENGERT: I need the gun back, because--
###575 [APPLAUSE]
###578 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: So it's a lovely apartment.
###582 JON GABRUS: I noticed.
###582 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Thank you.
###583 So honestly, it's in a great school
###585 district, hardwood floors.
###587 Second floor--
###588 I'll take you up there.
###589 JON GABRUS: Great.
###589 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Now, these three katana swords are on the
###591 wall at all times.
###593 JON GABRUS: Yeah, I was just--
###593 I was going to ask about it.
###594 Because I have kids, bunch of crazy, fucking kids.
###597 And I can't have them playing with katana blades or
###600 whatever that is.
###600 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: They are part of the apartment.
###602 They are non-negotiable.
###604 Did you call your own kids fucking crazy?
###607 JON GABRUS: When you see these monsters, you'll know what I'm
###609 talking about.
###610 One kid eats wood by the pound.
###612 I can't-- it's a fucking nightmare.
###615 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That's crazy.
###616 JON GABRUS: Thank you.
###616 See?
###617 I'm not like using that like, oh, my crazy kids.
###619 Like I think there's serious mental issues.
###622 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Sure.
###622 I'm a father myself.
###624 JON GABRUS: Oh.
###624 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Yeah.
###625 JON GABRUS: I would never have guessed.
###626 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: One of my kids?
###627 Bonkers.
###628 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Dad, are you done?
###629 JON GABRUS: No, we're not--
###630 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: We're running out of
###630 oxygen in the car.
###632 JON GABRUS: Mike, you're not in the car anymore, so your
###635 oxygen should be fine.
###636 And that is my good doorstop.
###641 God damn it, Mike.
###641 You took this from my--
###643 I use this doorstop to hold my door.
###645 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Mom lets me eat doorstops.
###648 JON GABRUS: Well then you can eat it on the
###649 weekend when you go visit.
###650 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh, I will.
###652 I will.
###653 JON GABRUS: Sit down right there.
###655 Thank you.
###656 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: So you have kids.
###657 OK.
###657 So it seems like this is a big apartment.
###658 It might be good.
###659 JON GABRUS: Yeah, it might be.
###662 Are those blades sharp?
###663 I got to-- this is a hard for me to--
###665 that seems like a very specific thing to have in an
###667 apartment that is non-negotiable.
###669 I feel like, once I move in and you're not around, I could
###673 take the katana blade.
###674 Just like I lived in an apartment where the landlord
###676 said, you can't go on the roof.
###677 The second he left I went up on the roof and smoked weed.
###681 So I feel like the second you leave, I'm going to put those
###683 katanas in a drawer or I'm going to play
###685 with them by myself.
###686 ALLAN MCLEOD: Daddy.
###688 JON GABRUS: Oh, no.
###688 What is it, Bruno?
###689 ALLAN MCLEOD: I pooped nails again.
###690 
###693 Nails came out of my butt.
###697 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I thought my kids were crazy.
###699 JON GABRUS: No, my kids are genuinely crazy.
###701 They eat things that aren't food.
###703 ALLAN MCLEOD: Dad, I got a nail in my eye.
###704 If I'd had wood, it might have stopped it.
###707 JON GABRUS: It's not how it-- are you pooping in your
###708 brother's eyes again?
###709 ALLAN MCLEOD: Yeah.
###710 JON GABRUS: Please, Bruno, none of that.
###712 And what do we say?
###714 It's I made boom-boom with nails.
###717 Trying to teach them better language.
###718 
###721 ALLAN MCLEOD: Nice swords.
###723 JON GABRUS: OK.
###725 You've got a point there, Mike.
###726 Insane fucking child likes swords.
###729 Shit nails.
###731 Do you know how you shit nails?
###732 Do you see how casual he was about it?
###734 That would ruin most people.
###736 My kids have--
###736 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: It's a jarring experience
###738 for me to see that.
###739 JON GABRUS: My kids are like fucking cartoon sharks.
###742 They swallow everything.
###743 I swear.
###744 You know how cartoons sharks do that.
###746 Is that not a casual expression here?
###748 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Here?
###749 JON GABRUS: Yeah, where are we?
###750 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: We're in this apartment.
###751 JON GABRUS: Yeah.
###751 Yeah, all right.
###751 JOE WENGERT: Dad?
###752 Daddy?
###754 JON GABRUS: One at a time they come.
###755 What is it?
###756 JOE WENGERT: I finished my math worksheet.
###758 I need you to check over my answers.
###760 JON GABRUS: Get out of here, you sick fuck.
###763 You're a fucking nightmare.
###764 JOE WENGERT: I need you to check my answers.
###767 JON GABRUS: No.
###767 No.
###768 JOE WENGERT: How do I know if they're right or not?
###770 JON GABRUS: Go clean up your brother's nail shit.
###772 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Sir, I do not mean to get involved, but
###774 that just seemed like a child crying for help.
###776 JON GABRUS: But his pants didn't even match his shirt.
###778 He's a wacky little kid.
###781 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That's not enough of a reason.
###783 Look, are your kids--
###784 JON GABRUS: I lump all my kids together a little bit.
###786 Some of them are better than others, OK?
###788 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: OK.
###789 JON GABRUS: But you know, by the time the third one comes
###791 around, you're a little worked up from your first two.
###794 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: And they're all just out there in
###795 the car by themselves?
###797 JON GABRUS: Yeah.
###797 Do we have to keep this like, awful, awful brown color that
###801 we have everywhere?
###802 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: God, no.
###803 JON GABRUS: I can repaint, but I can't move the katanas.
###805 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That's the one thing.
###808 ALLAN MCLEOD: OK, everybody.
###810 [APPLAUSE]
###817 ALLAN MCLEOD: So, you know, we've been having a lot of
###820 programming issues here, people not a big fan of what
###825 we're doing at the Hallmark Channel.
###829 So we brought into a new kid to be the CEO of
###836 the Hallmark Channel.
###839 You know, because kids, they have moms.
###841 They overhear a lot of stuff their moms like.
###845 That's the thinking behind me hiring a child.
###848 JON GABRUS: I'm standing right here, Mr. [INAUDIBLE].
###850 ALLAN MCLEOD: Oh, yeah.
###852 JON GABRUS: Hi.
###852 My name's Danny.
###853 I run the Hallmark Channel now.
###855 And we're gonna, my first idea, my first idea is--
###861 aw, I have a nervous boner.
###865 I have a nervous boner.
###867 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That is a huge boner for a little boy.
###869 JON GABRUS: Thank you.
###871 Thank you so much.
###873 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: That was not a compliment.
###874 It's more bewilderment.
###875 JON GABRUS: It's a compliment for me.
###877 JOE WENGERT: Is your nervous boner a programming idea?
###880 JON GABRUS: Yeah.
###881 Of course.
###882 That's why I did it.
###884 We're going to have a two-hour boner block on Thursdays.
###888 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Rob Lowe could play the boner.
###891 JON GABRUS: Yeah.
###891 Who's that?
###893 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh, he's an actor that does a lot of
###894 Hallmark movies.
###894 JON GABRUS: Oh, all right.
###895 ALLAN MCLEOD: He's a great guy.
###896 I'll call him.
###896 JON GABRUS: Cool.
###896 I'm a kid.
###897 So I'm not going to know that reference.
###899 Um, my other idea was we could have no
###903 commercials and free pizza.
###906 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Boss?
###907 I got to call bullshit here.
###909 ALLAN MCLEOD: Whoa.
###910 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Because I got a boner in a meeting last
###911 week, and you told me was inappropriate.
###914 ALLAN MCLEOD: Because you're an adult man.
###916 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Yeah, it was a confident boner.
###919 ALLAN MCLEOD: Well, this is a nervous child's boner, OK?
###922 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I'm just pissed because his
###923 is bigger than mine.
###925 JOE WENGERT: Maybe we need, like, to have a meeting so we
###927 know which boners are OK and which boners are sort of
###931 outside the lines.
###932 JON GABRUS: I guess as your new CEO of Hallmark Channel, I
###935 might as well have that meeting now?
###936 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Well you know what would help me a lot?
###938 Is a lot of times, I'm not cc:ed on the company email, so
###941 I only had like a half chub at the Friday meeting last week.
###945 Because I wasn't ready.
###945 I didn't know it was going on.
###947 And I was even also like, are they appropriate?
###950 Is it inappropriate?
###951 ALLAN MCLEOD: Well, we all emailed each other about that.
###955 And we're going to have to let you go.
###959 The half chub is not appropriate.
###962 At least get it all the way up or nothing at all.
###966 JON GABRUS: Right?
###968 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Guys?
###968 I can't have my marriage and my job end the same week for
###972 the same reason.
###973 
###976 ALLAN MCLEOD: Change is good.
###977 Embrace it.
###978 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: All right.
###978 Good luck, kid.
###979 You're gonna need it.
###982 Slam!
###984 ALLAN MCLEOD: He always does that.
###985 Every time he leaves, he closes the door, he says slam.
###988 That was another reason.
###990 We can't fire him on those grounds.
###992 JON GABRUS: I can't believe we fired such an awesome dude.
###993 OK, idea number three, now just try to get this through
###997 your thick, fucking skull, OK?
###999 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: What was idea number two?
###1000 JON GABRUS: Idea number two was no
###1002 commercials and free pizza.
###1003 You don't remember it because you were too busy thinking
###1004 about your own boner.
###1005 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: He's right.
###1008 JON GABRUS: All right.
###1009 Let's table the boners for now.
###1010 What we're talking about is free pizza, no commercials.
###1013 Because commercials suck, pizza is awesome.
###1015 So how can we capitalize on that?
###1018 ALLAN MCLEOD: Pizza commercials.
###1021 JON GABRUS: All right.
###1022 
###1024 JOE WENGERT: Only commercials for pizza?
###1027 ALLAN MCLEOD: Why not?
###1027 I'm trying to-- we have to have--
###1029 JON GABRUS: We're just spit-balling here
###1030 TONI RAMOS: I know we're tabling the boner talk.
###1033 But what about--
###1035 I feel weird saying this in front of a kid.
###1037 But getting wet, or moist, or maybe laughing too hard, or
###1043 hitting the edge of a desk and wetting
###1045 yourself a little bit--
###1047 does that count as like a boner time?
###1049 JON GABRUS: Are those things that could happen to people?
###1050 TONI RAMOS: To women who have had children, yes.
###1053 Yes, it can.
###1055 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: They can hit a table and wet
###1057 themselves?
###1057 TONI RAMOS: If you hit a part, yes.
###1060 Yes, it can.
###1062 If you hit a table too hard, it blows out a little bit.
###1066 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Sweetheart,
###1066 now, close your eyes?
###1068 TONI RAMOS: OK.
###1070 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Now, hold on.
###1070 I rearranged the furniture a little bit.
###1072 TONI RAMOS: Why would you do that?
###1075 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Hold on.
###1075 It's OK.
###1075 Just keep walking.
###1077 I got you something.
###1078 TONI RAMOS: Oh!
###1078 Oh.
###1080 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Did you come?
###1080 What happened?
###1081 TONI RAMOS: Whoa, definitely didn't come.
###1084 [APPLAUSE]
###1094 JON GABRUS: Mr. Smith, I wanted to talk to
###1095 you about your son.
###1097 I ran all the tests that I could.
###1098 And I feel like the only real answer left to this issue is
###1102 that I don't think he can blink.
###1104 
###1107 I don't think he--
###1109 the reason his eyes are drying out so rapidly is that he
###1111 doesn't know how to blink.
###1115 ALLAN MCLEOD: That's not usually a thing you have to
###1117 teach somebody.
###1118 JON GABRUS: Yeah, no shit.
###1119 And that's why I'm freaking out, OK?
###1121 I'm a doctor.
###1123 I'm a doctor of eyes, as we call it in the medical term,
###1127 an eye doctor.
###1129 And now I've got this.
###1130 I've never seen this before.
###1132 Blinking is something we instinctually do--
###1134 I did like the, [SNAP].
###1136 You didn't blink either.
###1139 ALLAN MCLEOD: Uh, I just--
###1139 I didn't want to miss anything.
###1141 I didn't want to miss anything.
###1143 JON GABRUS: [LAUGHING]
###1143 Are you--
###1144 a strange man just threw a punch in your face, and you
###1146 didn't even react at all.
###1148 ALLAN MCLEOD: Do it again, I'll blink.
###1149 I'll blink.
###1150 JON GABRUS: You didn't blink.
###1150 ALLAN MCLEOD: Oh, wait!
###1151 Wait!
###1151 JON GABRUS: Shit, it's hereditary.
###1153 It got to be on the Y chromosome.
###1156 ALLAN MCLEOD: Yeah, it's probably on the Y chromosome.
###1159 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Dr. Douglas?
###1160 JON GABRUS: [LAUGHING]
###1161 Uh-huh.
###1162 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Sorry to interrupt.
###1163 Your wife just called and left a message.
###1164 She wants you to call her as soon as you get a chance.
###1166 Thanks.
###1167 Bye.
###1168 ALLAN MCLEOD: Your secretary--
###1170 JON GABRUS: I'm just now noticing that my secretary
###1172 I've had for the last 18 years might never
###1175 have blinked before.
###1177 ALLAN MCLEOD: Gosh--
###1178 JON GABRUS: I'm always looking right here.
###1180 ALLAN MCLEOD: OK, OK.
###1180 I get that.
###1181 JON GABRUS: I got you right in the center there.
###1182 My bad.
###1183 I didn't mean to touch a stranger.
###1184 You didn't react at all, again, dude.
###1186 ALLAN MCLEOD: Well, what do you expect, my
###1188 pecs to blink now?
###1190 Look, I'm working on it.
###1191 My son stares at me creepily all the time,
###1195 even when he's asleep.
###1196 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Daddy?
###1197 Daddy?
###1198 Daddy?
###1200 ALLAN MCLEOD: No, it's me son.
###1201 Yes.
###1202 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I know.
###1203 I've just been waiting a long time for this optometry
###1206 appointment.
###1207 
###1210 ALLAN MCLEOD: We're going to get you those glasses.
###1212 JON GABRUS: That's very cute, but we're called eye doctors.
###1216 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Why do I need an eye doctor?
###1217 What's wrong with my eyes?
###1219 [INAUDIBLE] do anything.
###1220 JON GABRUS: There's nothing technically
###1221 wrong with your eyes.
###1222 It's more your lid.
###1224 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: The thing above my
###1225 eyes that does nothing?
###1227 JON GABRUS: Well, yeah, for most--
###1229 holy shit, you're really creeping me out.
###1232 That's some Michael Caine shit.
###1233 
###1238 [LAUGHS]
###1239 Did you just fake blink after I swung at you
###1242 to try to fit in?
###1244 ALLAN MCLEOD: Yeah, why don't you bust my balls about it?
###1247 JON GABRUS: I feel like my soul is being--
###1249 JOE WENGERT: Dr. Gabrus, we heard about your complaint.
###1252 And there's nothing that we can really do except to give
###1254 you this handgun.
###1256 So if you feel intimidated by any of your
###1259 patients or their parents--
###1262 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: So you're going to do this to make my
###1264 eyes react in any way at all?
###1265 JON GABRUS: Yeah.
###1267 What's wrong with you, kid?
###1268 Why aren't you afraid of a fucking gun, man?
###1270 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Fire it in the air near me.
###1272 See if anything happens at all.
###1274 Not a thing.
###1275 ALLAN MCLEOD: [YELLING]
###1276 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Oh!
###1277 Daddy!
###1278 Daddy, no!
###1279 I'd cry, but I can't close my eyes.
###1281 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: I heard a shot.
###1281 What's going on?
###1283 JON GABRUS: Jesus Christ, all of you, get out of here.
###1284 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Your wife said the recycling's going to
###1286 get picked up on Thursday this week.
###1288 JON GABRUS: Thursday?
###1289 No.
###1290 Sorry, I'm losing--
###1291 I'm cracking up here.
###1293 All right.
###1295 You see, I'm just an eye doctor.
###1297 Are you blinking all now from being shot?
###1300 ALLAN MCLEOD: This is years of blinks
###1302 flashing before my eyes.
###1305 JON GABRUS: That's literally what's happening.
###1307 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Teach me how to do that with those
###1309 above eye muscles.
###1311 JON GABRUS: Teach you how to blink?
###1312 ALLAN MCLEOD: Son.
###1312 JON GABRUS: That was the--
###1313 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Yes, Daddy.
###1313 JON GABRUS: I got the message.
###1314 ALLAN MCLEOD: Take my lids.
###1317 Take my lids.
###1319 Yes, peel them.
###1321 Peel them.
###1322 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: This is so gross.
###1324 ALLAN MCLEOD: Attach my lids to my son's eyes.
###1327 JON GABRUS: I honestly don't think that's the issue.
###1330 ALLAN MCLEOD: You've got to try.
###1332 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: But, Daddy, I have eyelids.
###1333 I just don't know how to use them.
###1336 ALLAN MCLEOD: Maybe you need double lids.
###1338 More lids, please.
###1341 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Jon, wake up!
###1341 Wake up, Jon.
###1342 Jon, wake up!
###1342 Wake up!
###1343 JON GABRUS: Oh!
###1343 [GASPING]
###1343 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: You were talking in your sleep.
###1345 JON GABRUS: Oh, no.
###1345 Oh, no.
###1347 Is it Thursday?
###1348 The recycling, oh, my god, the recycling--
###1351 oh, fuck.
###1352 I was supposed to put it out.
###1353 No.
###1353 Wait.
###1353 That wasn't the thrust of my dream.
###1357 That's all I remember.
###1359 Oh, fuck.
###1359 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: What a weird boner.
###1361 JON GABRUS: It's a normal boner.
###1365 [APPLAUSE]
###1371 JOE WENGERT: So we've narrowed down the names for the
###1374 Saturday morning cartoon block down to two names.
###1378 We're either going to call it Saturday Morning Fun Time or
###1382 Toonami, to sort of evoke the name of a natural disaster
###1389 that would kill--
###1389 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Oh, I got it.
###1390 JOE WENGERT: --maybe millions of people.
###1392 So Saturday Morning Fun Time.
###1394 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Or Toonami.
###1395 JOE WENGERT: Or Toonami.
###1396 Also--
###1398 I'm sorry.
###1398 There was a third option that I keep blanking about.
###1400 Cartoon 9/11 was another [INTERPOSING VOICES].
###1404 So one of those three--
###1405 and I can't figure out which ones to eliminate because
###1410 they're all very good.
###1412 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Good's a subjective term.
###1415 You've kind of pointed out the only problem with it, saying
###1418 that it invokes a natural disaster.
###1419 JOE WENGERT: Yeah, it's a little too on the nose.
###1421 Cartoon Fun Time is just like, the kids are going to be like,
###1424 this is insulting to us.
###1426 Let us decide if it's fun or not.
###1428 And we know it's cartoons.
###1429 
###1433 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Honestly, Joe, I would say the second
###1434 and the third ones are just borderline offensive, OK?
###1437 Like those children could have had family members that died
###1440 in the tsunami or many parents that were in 9/11, OK?
###1443 And that's just going to really harsh-- not make them
###1445 want to watch.
###1447 Fun time is fun for everybody.
###1448 JOE WENGERT: This way, they'll sort of deal with their
###1450 issues, I feel like, in a fun environment with their
###1454 favorite characters.
###1455 JON GABRUS: Hey, boss, I came up with a few others.
###1459 I should probably read them to you, because I wrote them in
###1461 such sloppy handwriting.
###1462 
###1464 Japanese Internment Cartoons.
###1467 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: You had to go out of your way
###1468 to think that up.
###1470 That's just going for offensive.
###1473 JON GABRUS: The Funenburg Trials.
###1475 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: At least there's an attempt at wordplay
###1478 in that one.
###1479 JON GABRUS: And this one is just called Lynch.
###1480 
###1484 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: It's just offensive.
###1486 And no one would even know that's a cartoon show.
###1489 JON GABRUS: Ahh!
###1490 All right.
###1491 I'll take these back, put them in the oven for
###1493 a little bit longer.
###1494 Ovens!
###1495 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: No.
###1495 No, I know where you're going with that.
###1498 JON GABRUS: OK, fair enough.
###1498 Sorry, boss.
###1500 I tried.
###1501 We got to find something better than Saturday Fun Time.
###1504 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Look, I'm not saying Saturday Fun Time
###1506 is perfect, but something like Action Packed
###1508 Hour, or Fun Zone.
###1509 Or Animation--
###1510 JOE WENGERT: Action Packed Hour?
###1511 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Action Pack Hour.
###1512 JOE WENGERT: OK, that's very rude of you.
###1514 OK?
###1515 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: How is that rude?
###1517 JOE WENGERT: You want to know-- you think that kids are
###1519 going to want to tune into something that's going to
###1520 remind them of car crashes and buildings imploding?
###1526 Two actions?
###1527 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I think 9/11 Hour is a little more
###1529 buildings imploding than Action Pack Hour.
###1532 JOE WENGERT: Well, most of the cartoons are going to be
###1534 airing between 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM.
###1536 I don't understand what the problem is with that.
###1539 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That's a stretch at best.
###1540 JOE WENGERT: What?
###1541 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That's a stretch.
###1542 JOE WENGERT: Nobody's watching the 8 o'clock cartoons.
###1545 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Look, I'm just saying--
###1547 even if that reference went over the kids heads, let's say
###1550 the kids are too young for 9/11, the parents are going to
###1552 be up, you know, making breakfast for the kids.
###1554 And they're going to watch it.
###1555 And adults will be offended by it.
###1557 It's just something--
###1557 JOE WENGERT: Those adults need to find something better to do
###1560 with their time, I think, than watch cartoons all morning.
###1565 Take care--
###1566 take care of your kids.
###1567 Focus on your career and your future.
###1570 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: All right.
###1571 Let me just run a little test by you.
###1573 You tell me which of these you think is better.
###1575 And I'm just going to go with the line of logic I think
###1577 you're using.
###1578 OK, let's go with Animation Station--
###1581 JOE WENGERT: Love it.
###1581 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Or just, Holocaust Hour.
###1583 JOE WENGERT: Super love it.
###1584 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: No!
###1585 JOE WENGERT: Wow.
###1586 Now, I got a dilemma again.
###1588 I don't know which one to take.
###1589 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: No.
###1590 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Excuse me.
###1591 I'm sorry to interrupt.
###1591 I just had an idea, kind of a brainstorm.
###1595 Hitler had some pretty good ideas.
###1598 I'm sorry, I don't actually work for this company.
###1599 I'm just looking for a bathroom.
###1602 Is there one on this floor?
###1603 I'll find it.
###1603 JOE WENGERT: Yeah, you just go down the hall, three doors
###1605 down to your right.
###1606 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Thank you.
###1606 JOE WENGERT: You're welcome.
###1609 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Slam.
###1610 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: He always does that.
###1613 Look, the cartoons themselves are G rated, OK?
###1617 All right?
###1617 They're for all audiences.
###1619 Some of them have smart jokes, because the parents will be
###1621 watching, too.
###1622 So the material itself is not--
###1624 is geared towards kids.
###1626 You want to make sure the title of the hour is as well.
###1629 ALLAN MCLEOD: Guys, guys.
###1629 Did you guys hear the news?
###1630 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: What happened?
###1631 ALLAN MCLEOD: 1,000 people just died in a Fun Time
###1634 Animation Station accident.
###1635 
###1639 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: All right, fuck it.
###1640 Let's go with Holocaust hour.
###1642 JON GABRUS: Thank you guys.
###1643 That's our first show.
###1645 [APPLAUSE]
###1650 JOE WENGERT: OK.
###1651 Right now, we're going to bring out another performer.
###1654 He's also a performer from the UCB Theatre.
###1657 And he's got a show coming on Comedy Central called
###1660 "Review." Let's give a warm welcome
###1661 to Andy Daly, everybody.
###1663 [APPLAUSE]
###1666 ANDY DALY: Thank you.
###1669 Thank you very much.
###1670 
###1673 Yeah.
###1674 That's a good round of applause.
###1676 MALE SPEAKER: Standing ovation--
###1676 [INAUDIBLE] that.
###1678 ANDY DALY: That son of a bitch just cut me off.
###1680 Hey, fuck you, you piece of shit.
###1683 Fuck you.
###1683 INTERN: Oh, this is amazing.
###1686 ANDY DALY: This guy just fucked with the wrong
###1687 motherfucker.
###1688 INTERN: Fuck, yeah, Mr. MacNeil.
###1690 ANDY DALY: Motherfucker, you just fucked
###1691 with the wrong guy.
###1691 INTERN: I got your back, Mr. MacNeil.
###1692 ANDY DALY: What the fuck is the matter with you?
###1693 I'm trying to fucking drive here.
###1694 You blow through that stop sign like that.
###1696 You don't fucking do that to people.
###1698 You got a stop sign?
###1700 You stop at the fucking white line.
###1701 INTERN: Mr. MacNeil.
###1702 ANDY DALY: Oh, yeah.
###1703 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
###1704 OK.
###1705 Hey, asshole.
###1706 It looks like something happened to
###1707 your fucking taillight.
###1708 
###1712 What the fuck happened to your sideview mirror, asshole?
###1717 Looks like your blind spot just got a
###1718 little bigger, fuckwit.
###1719 What are you going to do about it?
###1722 MALE SPEAKER: You forgot about something.
###1725 Oh.
###1726 You forgot one more thing.
###1728 
###1731 Hey!
###1731 You ever been in a smash off?
###1734 You are now.
###1736 
###1739 ANDY DALY: Smash off!
###1741 INTERN: No, no, no.
###1741 Mr. MacNeil, no.
###1745 No, Mr. MacNeil.
###1748 Stop, Mr. MacNeil!
###1749 That's my fucking car.
###1753 Please, Mr. MacNeil!
###1755 Please!
###1756 
###1758 Fucking stop him.
###1759 That's my car.
###1763 Somebody help me!
###1764 [INAUDIBLE]
###1764 ANDY DALY: Fuck you.
###1764 What are you going to do now, asshole?
###1766 MALE SPEAKER: I will end you.
###1771 [APPLAUSE]
###1779 ANDY DALY: What the fuck was that, you may well wonder?
###1782 Often, when a clip is shown in a context like this, it's
###1785 explained first and then shown.
###1786 But we'll do it the other way around where it's shown in
###1789 total mystery and then explained afterward.
###1791 I have a show premiering on Comedy Central soon called
###1794 "Review," in which I play character named Forrest, who
###1797 is a critic who reviews not movies, or food, or books, but
###1802 life experiences.
###1803 So what's it like to steal, what's it like to be a racist,
###1808 or what's it like to experience road rage?
###1810 And so, as you're now beginning to piece together
###1814 what you just saw, in that piece--
###1817 here's what I would have said.
###1819 The character has borrowed his intern's car to go experience
###1822 what it's like to have road rage.
###1823 And the intern comes along for the ride.
###1825 And here is what happens.
###1827 
###1830 So, yeah, right?
###1832 [APPLAUSE]
###1840 In retrospect it's enjoyable.
###1842 So that's it for that.
###1845 Now, will you do some improvising?
###1846 JOE WENGERT: Yeah, we're going to watch
###1847 another YouTube video.
###1848 And we're going to improvise off that.
###1849 ANDY DALY: Maybe we should improvise first and then watch
###1851 the video that the improvising is inspired by.
###1855 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1864 ROB MENARD: You little rascals.
###1867 You try to control the whole world for your own benefit
###1870 without regard to the needs of others or future generations.
###1874 You demand that we seek your permission and pay your fees
###1878 to exercise our rights or suffer being beaten with
###1881 sticks and shocked with tasers, which incidentally,
###1885 you force us to buy.
###1888 You steal our wealth, you tax our wages, our income, our
###1892 transactions.
###1894 You're burdening us and our kids with a debt which can
###1896 never be repaid, so that you can build bombs that you drop
###1900 on people on the other side of the planet while you're safely
###1904 sipping champagne well out of range, so you can eventually
###1908 do the same thing to them.
###1911 And you got us calling that freedom.
###1913 
###1915 You've raped the earth, devastated diversity,
###1918 monopolized money.
###1920 You poison the air we breathe and the water we drink.
###1924 You made organic food a thing by ladening the food supply
###1927 with chemicals.
###1929 
###1931 And you deny us our rights to the point of jailing us for
###1934 the plants we grow.
###1936 You claim to be protecting us from criminals and enemies by
###1940 calling us criminals, acting like one yourself, and then
###1943 needlessly creating enemies in our name
###1946 and with our resources.
###1947 
###1950 You have denied the entire planet peace in abundance in
###1953 order to fulfill your own psychotic wanton greed and
###1957 lust for power.
###1960 Then you claim to be the protector of our rights, but
###1962 then you abandon the biggest and reject the best.
###1965 Oh, god, you use deception when you craft your statutes.
###1969 You call them laws to justify your aggression.
###1972 And you cloak it all up in a great big flag of false
###1976 constitutionality.
###1977 
###1979 You rely on fear.
###1980 Oh, man, you're experts at it.
###1983 You use fear to create division.
###1985 And then ignorance--
###1986 you rely on ignorance to insure obedience.
###1990 You've completely perverted democracy buying politicians,
###1994 obstructed justice hijacking the courts.
###1997 You caused us to lose faith in our own institutions.
###2001 And best of all, you hindered our spiritual growth and the
###2005 development of our consciousness.
###2008 In short you've been very, very, very naughty.
###2012 
###2015 And we know it.
###2017 
###2028 ANDY DALY: So I watched your online dating video.
###2033 I just had some pointers, just as like an online video dating
###2037 consultant.
###2039 It's my job to help people get the most out of the service.
###2041 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: That's what I want.
###2042 ANDY DALY: And attract a mate who's really going to be good
###2048 for you but also be someone that exists.
###2051 You know what I mean?
###2052 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Well, I believe there's somebody out
###2053 there for everybody.
###2056 ANDY DALY: I don't know.
###2059 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Is it the shirt choice?
###2060 Because I was in my head about, like, do I just wear a
###2062 solid color?
###2063 Or should I do a pattern?
###2065 ANDY DALY: It was interesting to me that the hat seemed to
###2067 be made out of the material that the shirt was.
###2070 That suggests a certain self-sufficiency.
###2073 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: It used to be a hoodie, and then I made
###2076 it more economical.
###2079 ANDY DALY: I think I understand.
###2082 I would say that there is somebody out there for the
###2084 best version of everyone, right?
###2087 And that's what we want to put out there.
###2089 So your video was, let me actually ask you.
###2091 How long did you feel it was?
###2094 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh, god.
###2096 I mean this, can't be right.
###2098 But it must have been like 45 seconds or something.
###2100 Just like, it just flew by.
###2104 ANDY DALY: Fascinating.
###2104 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Like, a minute?
###2105 ANDY DALY: That's fascinating that you would say that.
###2107 It was three hours and 25 minutes long.
###2109 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Was it really?
###2110 ANDY DALY: It really was.
###2113 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Once you just deep dive into your
###2114 heart, it's like, [MAKES SOUND EFFECT].
###2118 ANDY DALY: Yeah.
###2119 It was--
###2120 it covered a wide range of topics, questionable
###2124 interpretations of history, science?
###2130 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah, I mean, I feel like I just kind
###2132 of want to put myself out there as much as--
###2134 cast a wide net.
###2135 And then just kind of see what kind of woman fish jumps into
###2141 the net and is like, take me out of the water
###2143 where I can't breathe.
###2145 ANDY DALY: That doesn't sound great.
###2149 JON GABRUS: I've watched your video five times.
###2151 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Really?
###2153 JON GABRUS: Yeah.
###2154 You seem amazing.
###2155 I agree with everything.
###2157 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
###2159 JON GABRUS: Soup to nuts, all of it--
###2162 you're a genius.
###2164 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: So you believe that the Declaration
###2166 of Independence was actually signed by dogs.
###2168 JON GABRUS: Yeah.
###2170 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: That the framers of the Constitution--
###2172 JON GABRUS: Were dogs.
###2173 They were dogs, and they had dogs.
###2175 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: That we came from dogs.
###2177 JON GABRUS: We were all originally dogs.
###2178 Yeah, I think that was the most important message that
###2181 you had there.
###2181 Because I always have dreams at night that I'm a Boston
###2184 terrier, urinating on various things.
###2187 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Oh!
###2188 I have a dream almost--
###2189 at least once a week where I'm a various thing
###2191 getting peed on.
###2193 JON GABRUS: Me, too.
###2194 I only sleep once a week for two hours.
###2196 So I have the dreams that-- well, I can't go to sleep.
###2199 Because just like in your video, you said everyone's pod
###2201 casting your nightmares out to various enemies and insurgents
###2206 and stuff like that.
###2207 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah, and the second you close your
###2208 eyes, that's where they start targeting the lasers at you.
###2210 And then, boom, you're going to get blown up.
###2212 JON GABRUS: That's great.
###2213 Can I-- can I have more napkins?
###2215 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
###2215 You have to get some roughage.
###2217 Absolutely.
###2218 JON GABRUS: Look, so, I think this is going well.
###2221 If you wanna--
###2221 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: I have to be honest.
###2223 I'm not totally feeling it.
###2224 I'm so sorry.
###2226 You're are an amazing girl.
###2228 I like you.
###2230 [APPLAUSE]
###2235 ALLAN MCLEOD: Yes, yes.
###2236 The missile will fly 5,000 miles or so and blow up the
###2242 whole continent.
###2243 But I have a question.
###2246 Where's the room where I drink my champagne?
###2250 Is it around here?
###2252 I didn't see the champagne room.
###2255 I'd like to enjoy some champagne as I
###2257 watch the world die.
###2258 
###2261 TONI RAMOS: I could fashion a champagne room for you.
###2264 I wasn't prepared for this.
###2266 ALLAN MCLEOD: Yes, you seem more like a brainy science
###2268 geek who toys with missiles and that sort of thing.
###2273 TONI RAMOS: Yes, I'm not used to human contact.
###2277 I am just so thrilled that you are around.
###2281 I could--
###2282 I have a bunch of Mountain Dew or Red Bull I could mix
###2287 together for some sort of champagne--
###2290 ALLAN MCLEOD: That's not the ingredients for champagne.
###2293 That's not the ingredients.
###2294 TONI RAMOS: OK.
###2295 All right.
###2297 ALLAN MCLEOD: Really should hire more wine connoisseurs or
###2301 something here at the factory, at the missile factory.
###2304 Because I mean, who's funding these sorts of operations?
###2308 People like me who wear furs and expensive jewelry and like
###2314 to drink champagne while people burn
###2317 up for no good reason.
###2319 TONI RAMOS: Oh, god.
###2320 Oh, gosh.
###2321 ALLAN MCLEOD: What are you looking on the ground?
###2323 There's no rooms down there.
###2327 I want my champagne room.
###2330 JOE WENGERT: I'm afraid I have some other bad news.
###2333 I just went to the area where the lunch was set up.
###2337 And there are no caviar.
###2339 There are no king crab legs.
###2342 Can I please have the name of your supervisor so that we can
###2346 complain to them now before the world is destroyed?
###2350 Because we are very unhappy with the job
###2352 that you've done here.
###2354 And you are going to perish along with everyone else in
###2357 the world, but I want it to go down on your record that you
###2361 are bad at what you do.
###2365 ALLAN MCLEOD: Very bad.
###2366 TONI RAMOS: I mean, we only have mere minutes.
###2369 I have some jerky.
###2372 His name is Hank, if that's what you're still looking for.
###2374 ALLAN MCLEOD: Jerky's name is Hank.
###2376 TONI RAMOS: I have jerky.
###2378 My boss's name is Hank.
###2380 Please don't tell him.
###2381 I'm going to get fired.
###2383 JOE WENGERT: You thought we wanted to snack on some jerky?
###2386 TONI RAMOS: It's all I have.
###2388 ALLAN MCLEOD: Benedict, what kind of missile factory silo
###2390 is this place?
###2392 You're the one that found them on the internet.
###2394 What--
###2395 JOE WENGERT: Their Yelp reviews were off the charts.
###2399 TONI RAMOS: Thank you.
###2400 [APPLAUSE]
###2406 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Excuse me.
###2407 Officer?
###2408 I'd like to turn myself in.
###2409 JON GABRUS: Sure.
###2410 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I raped the earth.
###2411 
###2415 JON GABRUS: I don't have time for any of this.
###2418 I got to do--
###2418 I got to file--
###2420 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I did it.
###2422 I've been doing it for years and I just woke up today, and
###2425 I realized I'm not driving a Prius.
###2428 I'm an earth rapist.
###2431 I've been following the earth back to its car at night, and
###2435 getting into my gas guzzling shit of a car
###2438 and raping this planet.
###2440 Take me away.
###2441 JON GABRUS: I'm going to just take you way for the way you
###2443 just talked to a police officer, for starters.
###2446 Raping the earth?
###2448 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Yeah.
###2449 JON GABRUS: Well, so what do you call it, if unbeknownst to
###2452 the earth, you dig a little hole, fuck it, and
###2456 then come in it?
###2458 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I don't, man.
###2459 Is that hole some fucking asphalt that's eating away at
###2462 our nutrients?
###2463 Or is it a compost--
###2463 JON GABRUS: You don't fuck asphalt.
###2464 You want mud or something like that.
###2467 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Look, man, you can rape the
###2469 planet how you want.
###2470 I'll rape the planet how I want.
###2473 You can fuck it and I can destroy it.
###2475 But my carbon footprint is unforgivable.
###2478 I've been raping this earth like it was a
###2480 fucking frat party.
###2482 Now, take me away.
###2483 I deserve it.
###2485 JON GABRUS: All right, man.
###2486 I'm going to take your prison, where there's going to be gas
###2490 guzzling, or whatever you refer to it.
###2492 ALLAN MCLEOD: All right.
###2493 Well, we ran the rape kit tests on the earth like you
###2498 forced us to do.
###2500 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: How bad is it?
###2502 ALLAN MCLEOD: I mean, it's pretty normal--
###2504 there's some grass in it, some bits of dirt and soil--
###2508 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I'm a monster.
###2511 ALLAN MCLEOD: There's no evidence that you--
###2513 we can only arrest you if you physically raped the earth.
###2516 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Now, did you do a rape kit on the
###2517 general environment's area, on this whole where that cop came
###2520 over and fucked it?
###2522 ALLAN MCLEOD: We did both--
###2524 JON GABRUS: [INAUDIBLE]
###2526 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Hey, you rape the earth your way.
###2527 I'll rape it my way.
###2530 ALLAN MCLEOD: Hey, don't worry.
###2531 The earth was asking for it.
###2534 He's OK.
###2534 He's [INAUDIBLE] me.
###2535 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: The earth was asking for it?
###2538 Why?
###2539 Because of its shiny blue oceans?
###2541 JON GABRUS: I mean, it's covered in 70% water.
###2544 ALLAN MCLEOD: I mean, come on.
###2546 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That's water that we need.
###2547 ALLAN MCLEOD: It's so wet.
###2549 It's so wet.
###2551 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Oh, so it's just asking for it?
###2552 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: All right, officers,
###2553 officers, get in here.
###2555 MALE SPEAKER: All right.
###2555 ANDY DALY: What?
###2556 MALE SPEAKER: Here's this?
###2558 ANDY DALY: I'm busy being a police officer.
###2559 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: We need to have a
###2560 little sensitivity training.
###2561 It's come to my attention that a number of you have been
###2563 making comments out when you're interviewing suspects
###2566 about raping the earth, and how the earth is asking for
###2570 it, and look at the way it's dressed, and if it didn't want
###2572 to be raped it should have stayed at Pangaea.
###2575 So from now on we just to look at the earth as not an
###2580 acceptable thing to talk about raping.
###2581 All right?
###2582 JON GABRUS: No matter--
###2583 OK.
###2584 Got it.
###2584 So like--
###2585 OK.
###2586 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: No.
###2586 Let's put anything out there.
###2587 I want to know where your heads are at.
###2588 All right?
###2588 ALLAN MCLEOD: It spread apart from Pangaea, like you said.
###2592 It spread out.
###2592 JON GABRUS: I mean, if I'm busting a couple of guys who
###2594 are smoking a blunt in their car, why can't I bring up that
###2597 I think raping the earth is OK?
###2600 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: How would that even come up just in the
###2601 process of arresting them for that?
###2603 JON GABRUS: You know, you see something.
###2604 You're like, oh that's from the earth.
###2605 Speaking of earth, you ever seen the way it rotates,
###2609 taking 24 hours?
###2611 Yeah, you're showing it off, motherfucker.
###2613 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Kowalski, you're having to do a lot of
###2614 work to bring rape earth into that
###2616 conversation, I feel like.
###2617 ANDY DALY: Why is the earth going out alone at night?
###2621 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Well, technically, it's not going
###2622 out alone at night because it's part of the solar system.
###2625 But even so, like would you say that was OK for a woman?
###2627 Like would you say your mother can't go out alone at night?
###2630 ANDY DALY: She cannot.
###2631 She's got a bad hip.
###2633 She needs help.
###2634 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Right, but you would never say to a
###2636 citizen that it would be OK to rape your mother because she
###2639 has a bad hip, or because she's going
###2640 out at night, right?
###2641 ANDY DALY: Certainly not.
###2642 [WHISPERS]
###2643 Yes, I would.
###2644 JOE WENGERT: I think what he's saying is, why can't the earth
###2646 sync up with some of the other planets, in terms of having
###2649 their orbits happen at the same time so they're not out
###2653 there in space on their own?
###2656 ANDY DALY: That is exactly what I am saying.
###2657 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Are you drawing a parallel between
###2660 earth's and other planets' orbits and women's
###2662 menstruations?
###2664 JON GABRUS: What?
###2665 ANDY DALY: Whoa.
###2665 JON GABRUS: Whoa.
###2666 Slow it down, creepo.
###2668 No one was saying that.
###2669 JOE WENGERT: I'm saying that they should hang out together.
###2671 I mean, earth and the other planets don't have a problem
###2674 all going to the bathroom together.
###2677 ANDY DALY: [LAUGHS]
###2678 JOE WENGERT: That didn't make any sense.
###2680 No.
###2680 I realize now that I think about it.
###2685 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: All right.
###2685 I don't you feel uncomfortable, Lewalski, but I
###2688 want to get a female perspective here, all right?
###2691 JON GABRUS: Well why don't we ask Darren?
###2692 He's part earth.
###2694 
###2696 What do women have to do with this?
###2698 ALLAN MCLEOD: He's a herm-earth-rodite.
###2700 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: What is he?
###2701 ALLAN MCLEOD: I always mispronounce it.
###2704 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Say it again.
###2704 ALLAN MCLEOD: Herm-earth-rodite.
###2705 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Herm-earth-rodite?
###2706 ALLAN MCLEOD: Herm-earth-rodite.
###2707 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: I'm a herm-earth-rodite.
###2709 JON GABRUS: Yeah.
###2710 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###2711 with both a penis and a layer of crust.
###2714 
###2717 [APPLAUSE]
###2723 JOE WENGERT: Hey, Dean Ramos?
###2724 I'm sorry to bother you.
###2725 But I'm supposed to be teaching an intro to art
###2729 history class in Williams lecture hall and Ted Nugent's
###2734 down there.
###2735 And he's just in front of the white board making some
###2738 YouTube videos.
###2738 TONI RAMOS: Ah, shit.
###2740 JOE WENGERT: And I can't get Ted Nugent out of the lecture
###2742 hall by myself.
###2743 He's got a couple of crossbows with him.
###2746 TONI RAMOS: Well, I'll help you out.
###2748 Let's go.
###2749 
###2753 JON GABRUS: And I know--
###2757 TONI RAMOS: Ted?
###2758 JON GABRUS: Dean.
###2759 TONI RAMOS: Yeah.
###2760 We need the room, all right?
###2761 JON GABRUS: But I have the room til 4:30.
###2762 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: I know you do.
###2764 JON GABRUS: I've signed in with the activities
###2765 coordinator.
###2765 I have the room til 4:30.
###2766 JOE WENGERT: He does?
###2767 TONI RAMOS: He does.
###2768 But just give us five minutes early out so
###2772 he can set up, please.
###2773 I know you're doing your rants and the world needs to know
###2778 about them.
###2778 But give us--
###2780 JON GABRUS: I mean, I shaved this flavor savor perfectly
###2782 for my big debut.
###2784 TONI RAMOS: What flavor are you saving?
###2787 JON GABRUS: Venison and other meats that I hunt myself.
###2791 Look, if you want the room, square--
###2794 it's all yours.
###2796 JOE WENGERT: I just feel like you could record your YouTube
###2798 videos from essentially anywhere at all.
###2801 And you keep choosing--
###2802 JON GABRUS: But this is where I keep my laptop.
###2804 
###2807 JOE WENGERT: You're using laptops wrong.
###2809 You could take laptops anywhere.
###2810 You don't have to keep them in--
###2812 JON GABRUS: But this is where the outlet is
###2813 that I plug my laptop.
###2814 What don't you understand about the
###2816 world around you, professor?
###2819 You could just call yourself professor in
###2821 this world and teach.
###2822 You know who teaches?
###2823 I teach, to the masses, the real word-- the word
###2827 of our Lord, me.
###2829 
###2832 ALLAN MCLEOD: What's going on in here?
###2834 I've got the room at 4:30.
###2838 That's right, me.
###2839 Jesse, The Body, Ventura--
###2842 former senator, conspiracy-monger.
###2846 JON GABRUS: We knew by the confidence and swagger in
###2848 which you entered the room that you could
###2850 only be Jesse Ventura.
###2851 Good to see you again, The Body.
###2853 ALLAN MCLEOD: Good to see you.
###2854 JON GABRUS: The Mind.
###2856 TONI RAMOS: You guys, I must have overbooked the room.
###2858 So if we could just have Professor Wengert come in,
###2861 just for this Wednesday, not a big deal, and then you guys
###2865 can get back again.
###2866 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah you did overbook it.
###2868 Because Randy Quaid signed up there.
###2869 And I want to talk about how the Hollywood hit mafia is
###2872 trying to assassinate us celebrities.
###2874 I've been in Canada the last four years.
###2876 This is the first time I came down, just to make this video.
###2878 TONI RAMOS: You guys can go in the hallway.
###2881 I'll show you.
###2882 Let me unplug the--
###2883 [SCREAMING]
###2884 JON GABRUS: Oh, no!
###2885 I didn't even save my files.
###2886 TONI RAMOS: No.
###2887 No, trust me.
###2888 I got it.
###2889 It's not a big deal.
###2890 Here we go, closing it down.
###2892 JON GABRUS: But I'm not in the mainframe anymore.
###2894 TONI RAMOS: No, it'll work.
###2896 Trust me.
###2897 JON GABRUS: Mainframe is everywhere.
###2898 
###2901 TONI RAMOS: All right.
###2902 All right.
###2902 JON GABRUS: That's my mainframe thing.
###2905 TONI RAMOS: That's your mainframe thing?
###2906 Great.
###2906 Awesome.
###2907 All right.
###2907 So, guys, if you want to follow me.
###2909 Mr. Wengert, if you want to get your
###2910 class prepped and ready.
###2912 JOE WENGERT: Great.
###2912 Thank you again.
###2913 TONI RAMOS: Absolutely.
###2914 JOE WENGERT: You need help with some of that stuff?
###2915 JON GABRUS: If you're going to carry the laptop, I think I
###2918 can get all the guns.
###2918 I'll be all right.
###2920 ALLAN MCLEOD: I got to get all my weights.
###2923 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: And I left all my "Christmas Vacation"
###2925 shit in here.
###2927 [APPLAUSE]
###2934 ANDY DALY: Hi.
###2934 How you doing?
###2935 I just want to let you know.
###2937 This produce over here, this is all organic.
###2939 OK?
###2940 And then over here, it's just full of chemicals that will
###2943 definitely shut your system down like that.
###2947 I'm talking about immediate organ failure.
###2951 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Wow.
###2951 You guys have really changed the way
###2954 Trader Joe's is organized.
###2955 ANDY DALY: Yeah.
###2957 We just drew it-- you know, everything used
###2958 to be mixed in together.
###2959 Now, we just got it real clear.
###2961 Organic, you can eat that and live.
###2964 Not organic--
###2965 immediate organ failure, death upon ingestion.
###2970 And it's a little more expensive for the organic.
###2974 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: How much are we talking?
###2975 Because I'm on a budget.
###2978 ANDY DALY: Typically like 25-- oh, hang on.
###2981 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Oh, my god!
###2982 TONI RAMOS: [GAGGING]
###2982 ANDY DALY: Just want to explain to you.
###2983 Over here is organic.
###2984 Oh.
###2986 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Am I allowed to just freely sample
###2988 like she did?
###2989 
###2992 ANDY DALY: No.
###2994 I mean--
###2996 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: All right.
###2996 What I--
###2997 ANDY DALY: Yeah, that was not supposed to happen.
###3000 Normally--
###3000 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Great, I'm going to have
###3001 to clean that up.
###3002 
###3005 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: OK.
###3006 Well, based on this woman's experience, I clearly see the
###3009 cons of eating what I'll just call, the death food.
###3012 ANDY DALY: That's a fair name for it.
###3014 Yeah.
###3014 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: But you also said that
###3015 this is more expensive.
###3016 So I'm torn.
###3019 ANDY DALY: It is a little more expensive, typically a markup
###3020 of like 25% or more.
###3023 That's got be a better way to clean up a dead body.
###3026 It's really--
###3027 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: He's just hitting that body with a mop.
###3028 ANDY DALY: He's just--
###3029 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Yep.
###3030 There it goes.
###3031 Yep.
###3032 ANDY DALY: --trying to push her with a mop.
###3032 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: He's got to push it more.
###3035 The body is moving towards the mop.
###3039 ANDY DALY: Yeah.
###3039 JON GABRUS: Need help with this, Tim?
###3041 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah, would you mind?
###3041 JON GABRUS: What happened here?
###3042 She hit herself on the corner of desk, something like that?
###3044 JOE WENGERT: All right.
###3045 That's the end of our second set.
###3048 [APPLAUSE]
###3053 JOE WENGERT: How you guys feeling?
###3054 You're still in it with us?
###3056 [APPLAUSE]
###3059 JOE WENGERT: We're going to do one more set of improv.
###3061 So we're going to watch one more YouTube video before we
###3063 get into it.
###3067 RYKER DUNCAN: Kelsey, you manipulate me.
###3071 You manipulate my mind.
###3073 You manipulate my heart.
###3076 You tell me how you were the one that helped me get through
###3083 my dad's death, you were there for me, how I promised my dad
###3092 that he would meet the girl of my future before he dies, and
###3101 that you were the one.
###3102 
###3106 And then today, you have the audacity to go to someone else
###3113 after telling me that you were falling back in love with me.
###3115 
###3118 That shit don't fly with me.
###3121 I may have been dating Jess.
###3123 I didn't love her and you knew that.
###3127 Use your fucking mind.
###3130 Of course, you don't have one.
###3133 They're too fucked up with drugs, and alcohol, and all
###3138 the other poisoning.
###3139 
###3143 You go out with someone who you said raped you.
###3149 You keep getting your heart broke.
###3151 Yet you keep going back to the same guy--
###3152 
###3155 same guys over and over and over.
###3156 At least I don't do that.
###3159 Fact is, you want to manipulate my mind.
###3162 You want to manipulate my heart.
###3165 You want try to break me down.
###3167 It's not going to happen.
###3170 I'm a lot smarter than that.
###3173 I'm a lot smarter than a lot of people give me credit for.
###3175 
###3179 But if you want to try and destroy me, and go that low,
###3184 say, oh I love you, oh, I'm back in love with you, and
###3188 you're not, and it's just a lie, do me a favor.
###3193 You do those drugs, you do that alcohol, you end up dead,
###3200 and you burn.
###3202 Burn in hell.
###3204 
###3209 Rest in peace, bitch.
###3215 [APPLAUSE]
###3217 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: All right, YouTube employees.
###3219 All right, YouTube employees.
###3221 ALLAN MCLEOD: What's going on, I'm excited.
###3222 ANDY DALY: Comedy week!
###3222 Comedy week!
###3223 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: We are doing Comedy Week.
###3224 ANDY DALY: Comedy Week!
###3225 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Here's what we got to do.
###3227 We need some funny videos to inspire some comics.
###3230 ANDY DALY: Fuck, yeah!
###3231 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Just brainstorm.
###3231 What's like the funniest topics you guys can think of?
###3233 ANDY DALY: Oh, like the death of your father.
###3236 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: OK.
###3236 All right, all right, all right, all right.
###3237 All right.
###3237 That's a little heavy.
###3239 That's a little heavy for the first one up.
###3239 But we're spit-balling.
###3240 No wrong answers, all right?
###3241 No wrong answers.
###3243 TONI RAMOS: A girl that keeps going back to a guy that says
###3246 she's been raped by him.
###3249 ANDY DALY: I was hoping you were going to say rape!
###3251 TONI RAMOS: Yes!
###3252 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: OK.
###3252 TONI RAMOS: It's Comedy Week!
###3253 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: It is.
###3253 OK.
###3254 But also, just think like generic, like
###3256 broadly fun, silly--
###3258 ANDY DALY: Like somebody who's so mentally ill that it's
###3260 depressing.
###3261 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: OK, yeah.
###3262 You can objectively maybe laugh at that.
###3264 JOE WENGERT: I have one that I think is pretty funny.
###3266 It's a cat, and you don't realize this when
###3270 you first watch it.
###3271 But the owner's holding its paws out so it looks like it's
###3275 playing a keyboard.
###3276 And then you find out that cat raped a bunch of other cats.
###3280 JON GABRUS: I was not on board at first, and then something
###3284 piqued my interest in the middle.
###3285 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: I had the exact opposite experience.
###3288 I was on board at first, that sounded like a typical, fun
###3290 YouTube kind of thing.
###3291 And then--
###3292 I don't even know how we get that information across there.
###3294 The cat raped--
###3295 JOE WENGERT: It's my cat.
###3297 And it has a problem with raping other cats.
###3300 I cannot get it to stop.
###3301 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: All right, Drew, you had--
###3303 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: What about this?
###3303 What if it's like a montage of a bunch of different videos of
###3307 people getting kicked in the nuts?
###3310 And every time they get kicked in the nuts it plays like a
###3311 weird wacky sound effect, like boing?
###3313 And then we actually pan out and reveal that this is going
###3316 on inside the mind of a man who is giving his suicidal
###3320 video into a video blog before he puts a gun in his mouth.
###3324 Cries and says, this is for you, Daddy.
###3327 And blows his brains out.
###3329 ANDY DALY: I like that.
###3331 JON GABRUS: I feel like we could lose all the nut kicks,
###3333 and just get to the funny stuff right off the bat.
###3336 ANDY DALY: Can we just say this for sure?
###3337 Let's not show any, any videos where it doesn't feel like at
###3341 the end, that person either killed
###3343 someone else or himself.
###3344 
###3347 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: I mean, I guess.
###3348 I got to be-- so far, I'm closest on board with that
###3350 last one, but really in protest.
###3353 ANDY DALY: And preferably, we could see the murder weapon in
###3355 the shot, if possible--
###3357 six or seven of them, swords, or guns, or what have you.
###3361 JON GABRUS: What about that channel we have on our site
###3362 that is all like diatribes that people are giving right
###3366 before they set their cult leader's house on fire?
###3369 You know the one, where the people are just talking
###3371 directly to the camera as the FBI is coming
###3373 in and killing them?
###3374 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah, I did not sign off on
###3375 that channel, guys.
###3377 JON GABRUS: It's Comedy Week, chief.
###3378 It's comedy.
###3379 ANDY DALY: Comedy Week.
###3381 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Wait.
###3381 I'm sorry.
###3381 So is it going to be like-- that's an example of
###3383 the video we do?
###3384 JON GABRUS: Let's use those videos.
###3384 I think those videos are the best.
###3385 They're two camera.
###3386 And they're people about to be murdered, like
###3388 police-assisted suicide.
###3390 TONI RAMOS: It's like a quick eight-minute thing and you get
###3393 to--there's lots of fun stuff.
###3394 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Let me give you guys an example.
###3395 Maybe somebody wearing something kind of interesting,
###3397 or like a conversation starter, doing a voice, or an
###3400 impression or something?
###3401 ANDY DALY: Like a mustache they're too depressed to grow
###3403 out all the way.
###3405 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: OK.
###3406 Yeah, yeah.
###3406 All right.
###3407 That's fine.
###3407 That's in the ballpark.
###3408 
###3411 ANDY DALY: I think we know what we're doing.
###3412 
###3415 [APPLAUSE]
###3421 JON GABRUS: If you're nervous at all about giving the
###3422 eulogy, I think you'll be fine.
###3424 Just, if you can--
###3426 the last one was super intense when Mom died.
###3429 So OK?
###3430 Just keep it low key, light, maybe one anecdote, one joke.
###3435 And I'll be up here to support you.
###3436 TONI RAMOS: Thank you.
###3437 Thank you so much.
###3438 JON GABRUS: And just remember, not too much.
###3441 
###3447 TONI RAMOS: Thank you all for coming to my cunt of a
###3451 mother's funeral.
###3454 She was a real woman.
###3458 I loved her so much because that fat, fucking bitch
###3462 wouldn't do anything.
###3464 And that's when I learned to be a real woman.
###3467 JON GABRUS: Toni!
###3467 Toni.
###3468 TONI RAMOS: What's up?
###3469 It went all black and then I just started going.
###3473 JON GABRUS: The services will continue in a moment.
###3475 This always happens at funerals.
###3476 You went a little dark.
###3478 You used the C-word
###3480 TONI RAMOS: Cunt?
###3481 JON GABRUS: That's the C-word I was referring to.
###3483 TONI RAMOS: I didn't know if it was cancer.
###3484 JON GABRUS: Yeah.
###3486 ALLAN MCLEOD: Boo.
###3486 Let's do the eulogy some more.
###3490 Boo.
###3490 JON GABRUS: Sir, could you take the Solo
###3491 cup off your mouth?
###3492 We couldn't hear you.
###3493 
###3497 ALLAN MCLEOD: Boo.
###3498 JON GABRUS: I think he wants more of the eulogy.
###3500 Just light, light.
###3501 ALLAN MCLEOD: Tell a funny story.
###3505 JON GABRUS: Thank you, sir.
###3506 TONI RAMOS: Uncle Jimmy--
###3508 a funny story.
###3511 When I was five, I started ballet and have
###3516 continued on since.
###3517 And the first day of ballet class, I remember, I got out
###3522 of the car.
###3522 I was so excited.
###3525 My mom grabbed my face.
###3529 And she took her cigarette with her shaky hand.
###3532 And she burned my cheek.
###3534 And she said, you fucking dance.
###3538 Dance, little baby, dance.
###3540 Mama's gonna go get drunk.
###3543 Mama's gonna get drunk and--
###3546 JON GABRUS: All right.
###3547 All right!
###3548 Toni!
###3548 Toni, I let you hang out there.
###3550 I thought that story was going to take a--
###3552 TONI RAMOS: It got so black.
###3553 And then I got dizzy and then I didn't know what happened.
###3557 JON GABRUS: Well, what happened was you told the
###3559 dance, you baby, dance story.
###3561 TONI RAMOS: Oh, my mom.
###3562 JON GABRUS: I know, she was so--
###3563 TONI RAMOS: That was my first burn she gave me.
###3566 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Boo, we want more eulogy.
###3569 Not clearly videos stolen from Comedy Week.
###3572 
###3575 JOE WENGERT: Hey, Tina?
###3577 Can I ask you a question?
###3579 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Sure.
###3580 JOE WENGERT: I heard that you, uh, you passed around a
###3584 birthday card for Jerry's birthday.
###3587 But you didn't come by and ask me to sign it.
###3591 And I just wanted to let you know that shit
###3595 don't fly with me.
###3596 
###3601 If we are going to celebrate someone's birthday in this
###3605 office, I better to be an integral part of that
###3609 celebration.
###3610 Because if I find out about it, that shit
###3613 don't fly with me.
###3616 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: Tuck, two things--
###3618 number one, I am so sorry.
###3620 And number two, you are doing great for your first week as
###3624 an intern here.
###3625 
###3629 JOE WENGERT: I know I've only been here a week.
###3632 But Jerry and I have shared a couple of fun moments.
###3635 And I would have very easily been able to reference one of
###3638 those moments into a message on his birthday card that
###3643 would have made his birthday brighter.
###3645 But then what do I find?
###3647 I got a fucking knife stuck in my back by you, Tina.
###3651 ALLAN MCLEOD: Hey, man.
###3652 I'm sorry.
###3652 I forgot to give you the paper clips back earlier.
###3656 I borrowed them.
###3657 I used a lot of them.
###3658 But I meant to give them back to you sooner than now.
###3663 But anyway, sorry about that, man.
###3666 Been a real busy day.
###3668 JOE WENGERT: You used a bunch of my paper clips?
###3670 ALLAN MCLEOD: Yeah, but--
###3671 JOE WENGERT: I'm confused.
###3672 I though you were just going to borrow them, and you said
###3673 you'd be right back with them.
###3675 ALLAN MCLEOD: Yeah, yeah.
###3676 Well, when they've all been processed I'll-- if it's an
###3680 important to you I'll try to gather those paper clips back
###3683 and return them to you.
###3685 JOE WENGERT: It's just that my whole thing is you're going to
###3694 come over here, and take my supplies and tell me that one
###3700 thing's going to happen with them.
###3702 And then I come to find out that a completely different
###3706 thing has happened with them.
###3708 And also, you're giving me a timetable.
###3710 And then you might as well just not even bother to do
###3713 that because it doesn't mean a fucking thing.
###3717 That shit don't fly with me, OK?
###3721 ANDY DALY: Hey, you know, it Friday.
###3723 I think we're all just going to knock
###3724 off around 3:00 today.
###3725 I know we talked about staying until 4:30 or 5:00.
###3728 We're all going to leave at 3:00.
###3729 Cool?
###3731 JOE WENGERT: I might need to sit down for this one.
###3735 ANDY DALY: What's up?
###3736 No, we're all just going to head out at 3:00.
###3737 Just going to take off a little early.
###3738 JON GABRUS: Here's your chair.
###3739 Here's your chair.
###3740 JOE WENGERT: Thank you.
###3741 JON GABRUS: You're welcome, please.
###3744 ANDY DALY: Just because Monday's a holiday, figured
###3745 give everybody a jump on the--
###3747 JOE WENGERT: When I got up this morning, I said, I'm
###3752 going to go in.
###3753 Get into the office around 9 o'clock like I normally do.
###3756 ANDY DALY: Yeah, that was great.
###3757 We saw you at 9:00.
###3757 Great.
###3758 JOE WENGERT: And I was like, maybe I'll hang out with my
###3761 buddies tonight.
###3762 Maybe I'll go out and hang out with the gang.
###3764 ANDY DALY: That sounds great.
###3764 JOE WENGERT: And I said you know what, I'll just send them
###3766 all an email.
###3766 Maybe we'll meet up later.
###3768 What time am I going to put in the email?
###3769 Well, clearly I'll put around 5 o'clock.
###3772 Because I know that the work day here ends around 5
###3776 o'clock, at the earliest, 4:30.
###3779 And if for some godforsaken reason, the powers that be
###3785 decide that we're going to just shirk our
###3787 responsibilities and fuck off at 3 o'clock, I, as an
###3793 employee, will be made aware of such a decision.
###3796 But that hasn't happened.
###3798 So I know that the day ahead of me is going to be smooth
###3802 sailing with what I normally expect, working from 9 o'clock
###3807 til 5:00 PM.
###3810 ANDY DALY: You can stay til 5:00.
###3812 JOE WENGERT: Oh, OK.
###3812 No problem.
###3813 
###3815 [APPLAUSE]
###3820 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Here we are in hell.
###3823 It's every bit as horrible as I would have imagined.
###3826 What did you do to get here?
###3828 ALLAN MCLEOD: I had some of that alcohol.
###3833 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah?
###3835 ALLAN MCLEOD: Yeah.
###3835 I had some of that alcohol.
###3836 JON GABRUS: Welcome to hell, boys.
###3838 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Are you, uh--
###3840 JON GABRUS: Yeah, I'm one of the devil's sidekicks, if you
###3842 can call me that.
###3844 I funnel his diarrhea every day.
###3847 It's part of the hell gig.
###3849 Look, ah--
###3851 ALLAN MCLEOD: Out of-- out of him?
###3852 Or into him?
###3854 JON GABRUS: Yeah, out of him into my mouth.
###3856 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Really?
###3857 JON GABRUS: Like, beer funnel.
###3858 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Because I would think a sidekick would
###3861 be like a position of like, you're a step above the people
###3863 that are prisoners here.
###3866 JON GABRUS: And of course as you know, it's part of hell.
###3869 You should probably know this.
###3870 But "Toonami" is cancelled.
###3872 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Come on.
###3873 
###3875 ALLAN MCLEOD: This really is hell!
###3877 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: What are they going
###3878 to show in its place?
###3881 JON GABRUS: There's a couple of different programs they
###3883 might be airing.
###3886 There might be the John Wayne Crazy hour.
###3888 It's a pun on Gacey.
###3890 Give me a second.
###3891 I'm trying to think of some.
###3893 ALLAN MCLEOD: You shouldn't have to think of--I mean, they
###3894 already exist.
###3896 JON GABRUS: Yeah, yeah.
###3896 They all-- but you know, also, I've had a steady diet of the
###3899 devil's diarrhea for the last infinity amount of years.
###3903 So if you can cut me a little slack here.
###3907 There is the, it's the Child Abuse Power Hour, or like that
###3912 Power Child Abuse Hour.
###3913 I don't remember the exact--
###3915 ALLAN MCLEOD: Well, I like those names.
###3915 JON GABRUS: But more importantly, the worst part
###3917 about hell is that "Toonami" has been canceled.
###3919 
###3921 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Look, I'm not 100% sure I belong here.
###3925 The only thing that I ever did in my life was I broke up with
###3927 my boyfriend.
###3928 
###3931 And I'm going through everything.
###3932 He was really upset.
###3933 Like, he was really, really mad.
###3934 JON GABRUS: Why did you break up with him?
###3935 Was it because--
###3936 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: He was crazy.
###3937 He was like a crazy guy.
###3939 He was really weird.
###3940 He was totally different from the point that I met him until
###3942 the point when I decided to break up with him.
###3943 JON GABRUS: You broke up with him because he raped you, and
###3945 that was like a known thing around the school?
###3947 
###3951 ALLAN MCLEOD: We're dealing with like hell-type stuff
###3953 here, so we're assuming it was a pretty severe breakup.
###3955 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: Yeah, sorry.
###3956 Wait, wait.
###3956 If he raped me, then I would go to hell for
###3958 breaking up with him?
###3959 JON GABRUS: Well, I'm not saying that.
###3960 ALLAN MCLEOD: You might have been asking for it.
###3964 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: I'm not a planet.
###3965 ALLAN MCLEOD: That's too far in hell?
###3967 JON GABRUS: In hell, that's a little touchy.
###3968 ALLAN MCLEOD: That's crossing the line?
###3969 MIKE LEFFINGWELL: No, just, nothing happened specifically.
###3971 I just broke up with him.
###3972 Because I was like, I don't want to be
###3973 involved with this guy.
###3973 He's just weird.
###3975 JON GABRUS: OK.
###3976 I'm really sorry I came over here.
###3980 JOE WENGERT: I was going to run out and grab lunch for
###3982 everybody down here in hell.
###3985 I was going to go to McDonald's.
###3986 Do you guys want McRibs?
###3989 ALLAN MCLEOD: McRib is back?
###3990 JOE WENGERT: Just kidding.
###3991 There's no McRibs ever in hell.
###3993 [YELLING]
###3993 DREW DIFONZO MARKS: That's our show!
###3995 [APPLAUSE]
