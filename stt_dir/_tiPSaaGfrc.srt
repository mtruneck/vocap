Chris Parachini from Roberto's

in Williamsburg.


11
0:0:28,83 --> 0:0:32,98



12
0:0:32,98 --> 0:0:36,42
It was part of my plan
to eventually


13
0:0:36,42 --> 0:0:37,56
open up my own place.


14
0:0:37,56 --> 0:0:41,22
Once this space became
available, just owning a


15
0:0:41,22 --> 0:0:44,8

I wanted to do.


16
0:0:44,8 --> 0:0:47,867
We're going over there because
our friend, Zeb, is going to

0:0:47,867 --> 0:0:51,99
hook us up with some oysters
and some nice cocktails.


18
0:0:51,99 --> 0:0:54,71
I went to the French
Culinary Institute.


19
0:0:54,71 --> 0:0:56,55
I moved here in '97
to do that.


20
0:0:56,55 --> 0:1:0,575
And then worked at Tribeca
Grill, just to kind of get me


21
0:1:0,575 --> 0:1:2,2
through school, because I was
going to school at night.


22
0:1:2,2 --> 0:1:3,596
And then I started working
at Balthazar.


23
0:1:3,596 --> 0:1:7,31
And I became a sous chef there
after about two years.


24
0:1:7,31 --> 0:1:10,52

way through everything in

that had either been here at
the restaurant with us,

the rent that kills you.

the rent, and it's the

size of the space.

between 1st and 2nd.


117
0:4:49,5 --> 0:4:51,59

So we went out to Brooklyn.


126
0:5:3,46 --> 0:5:6,89

idea was that this was a place


127
0:5:6,89 --> 0:5:9,79
made by hand with a
group of friends.


128
0:5:9,79 --> 0:5:13,1

Woodstock, that kind of 1970's


129
0:5:13,1 --> 0:5:14,2
communal vibe.


130
0:5:14,2 --> 0:5:16,56
So that's where the oven
came into play.


131
0:5:16,56 --> 0:5:17,69

0:5:17,69 --> 0:5:20,19

foremost, everything here is

certain dishes they might have

0:5:28,74 --> 0:5:30,36
or another.


138
0:5:30,36 --> 0:5:32,36

neighborhood, we try and


139
0:5:32,36 --> 0:5:33,81
run specials pretty
frequently.


140
0:5:33,81 --> 0:5:36,5
So there's usually something new
or something you might not


141
0:5:36,5 --> 0:5:37,69
have seen before unless
you come here a


142
0:5:37,69 --> 0:5:38,85
couple days a week.


143
0:5:38,85 --> 0:5:40,89
JEAN ADAMSON: In that sense, it
was just kind of like the


144
0:5:40,89 --> 0:5:44,47
food was just supposed to
be homey and comforting.


145
0:5:44,47 --> 0:5:47,3
We have a couple of dishes of
mine that stay on the menu.

0:5:47,3 --> 0:5:51,9
But Brian's always offset that
in a more technical way but


147
0:5:51,9 --> 0:5:53,76
still have that seeming
comfort,


148
0:5:53,76 --> 0:5:55,566
delicious vibe to them.

invited everybody.

We told the whole staff
to come back and--

their friends.


183
0:7:4,91 --> 0:7:5,66

their friends.


184
0:7:5,66 --> 0:7:7,79
We just kind of wanted it to
just be like a bunch of


185
0:7:7,79 --> 0:7:12,79
friends coming back, as if it
turned into a house party.


186
0:7:12,79 --> 0:7:14,176
I've got to change.


187
0:7:14,176 --> 0:7:15,1
-Change?


188
0:7:15,1 --> 0:7:16,92
JEAN ADAMSON: Well yeah, I'm
not going to wear this.


189
0:7:16,92 --> 0:7:20,31
We just wanted to do something
different, because we were


190
0:7:20,31 --> 0:7:23,52
like, well, let's do something
that we don't normally make at


191
0:7:23,52 --> 0:7:24,18
the restaurant.


192
0:7:24,18 --> 0:7:26,79
Because Brian works here a ton,
and who wants to come


193
0:7:26,79 --> 0:7:27,58
back here--


194
0:7:27,58 --> 0:7:28,8
not that it's not delicious--


195
0:7:28,8 --> 0:7:32,67
and eat a huge pork chop
or chicken or whatever.


196
0:7:32,67 --> 0:7:35,3
And so we knew that those
guys were coming.


197
0:7:35,3 --> 0:7:36,93
And they'd both had experience
in the oven.


198
0:7:36,93 --> 0:7:38,93
And so we're like, let's
just bring that to


199
0:7:38,93 --> 0:7:40,37
the table and see.


200
0:7:40,37 --> 0:7:43,17
I thought that it turned out
really community based.


201
0:7:43,17 --> 0:7:44,3
Everyone's doing everything.


202
0:7:44,3 --> 0:7:46,1
And I thought it
was really fun.
