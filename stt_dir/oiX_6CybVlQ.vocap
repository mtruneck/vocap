###4 MALE SPEAKER: What's going on back there?
###7 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: That's old Chief Two Beers, little
###12 dismount before the trip.
###13 
###17 Hopefully they're done before it gets dark.
###21 Just busted him.
###23 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###47 BRAD GERLACH: He calls me and says, hey man, let's go do
###50 some motorcycle riding.
###52 Bring it on, dude.
###53 I'm ready to go.
###54 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###84 How do you-- hey, how do you [INAUDIBLE] gas [INAUDIBLE]?
###86 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Lefty loosey, righty tighty.
###88 BRAD GERLACH: Yeah, I know that, but I mean did you press
###91 it down or something?
###92 Great, got to get it on footage.
###94 Hey, hey, hey, hey, Chris.
###95 How do you get the gas tank open, man?
###98 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: You just do.
###99 BRAD GERLACH: Spin it?
###100 I looked at a couple of his boards.
###102 I was like, oh man, this guy looks like he
###104 knows how to shape.
###104 I just called him up to--
###106 hey, I want to get a board.
###108 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: The conversation was probably like
###109 five minutes on the phone before I even knew who he was.
###112 BRAD GERLACH: When he really knew it was me after a while,
###114 I was like, oh shit.
###115 Sorry, dude.
###116 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: What was your last name again?
###117 He's all, Gerlach.
###118 I'm like, oh OK, OK.
###122 BRAD GERLACH: He's kind of a grump, you know, so--
###125 He's [GROWLING], you know?
###127 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: It's a big commitment to sponsor
###130 someone like Brad.
###131 These guys are like 50 boards a year.
###133 And I don't have those cards in my deck right now.
###135 BRAD GERLACH: Oh, we just ended up becoming friends.
###137 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Friends are first to me anyway, so--
###139 Brad seems like a complete nut.
###142 And he is a complete nut.
###144 And he's always a good time, and you never
###147 know what to expect.
###149 BRAD GERLACH: Those are called "foors," fake doors.
###153 Do you ever do that with words?
###155 You put two words together like sweaty
###157 balls, "swalls." Woo!
###159 
###166 "Swalls!"
###170 The exciting part was that we're going to meet in New
###173 York, pick the bikes up in New York City, and then head up
###177 north to New England.
###178 And I'm always looking for waves.
###180 And I'm always in some car, boat, or airplane.
###183 And the most comfortable way to go looking for waves is on
###185 motorcycle, for sure.
###187 It's really fun to cruise with one of your best buds.
###191 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Obviously we have surfing in common.
###193 But when we get together, it's kind of like the last thing we
###195 usually talk about.
###196 
###199 BRAD GERLACH: Think about when we first got going in New
###202 York, couple times driving along, and then all of a
###205 sudden going like--
###206 I had a couple of visions of eating it and I was like, OK
###209 just let it go.
###210 Let it go.
###211 Because it's just like [SIGHING].
###215 Think about it.
###215 You can just eat it so easily.
###217 You're just like, splatter.
###218 
###221 Hey, cheers.
###223 Here's to not eating shit, huh?
###224 
###231 That guy just threw a cigarette butt at you.
###234 [INAUDIBLE]
###236 Welcome to the Hamptons.
###238 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: This guy needs to ride
###239 a motorcycle backwards.
###240 Look at that hair.
###241 BRAD GERLACH: Which guy?
###242 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Right here.
###243 BRAD GERLACH: What?
###244 That's who you're talking about.
###245 That's who he's talking about.
###246 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: No, there's another one.
###248 BRAD GERLACH: There's another one?
###250 The guy with the--
###251 oh.
###251 What?
###252 The guy with the blonde hair?
###254 Now he stopped talking and looked over and said--
###256 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Yeah, we're talking to you.
###258 What the fuck you want?
###261 BRAD GERLACH: We're just wondering where we
###262 could get the same--
###263 is that a beanie?
###265 Because that's cool shit, man.
###267 I need that.
###267 I need that.
###268 I need that.
###269 
###284 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: There she is, the mighty Atlantic.
###287 BRAD GERLACH: Oh, shit.
###289 Pumping.
###290 
###293 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Think we're going to surf this whole trip?
###295 BRAD GERLACH: Oh, look at that little--
###298 maybe low tide.
###299 
###301 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: There's definitely a swell.
###303 Those tides are so high.
###305 BRAD GERLACH: Yeah.
###306 
###308 Settle down, would you?
###310 
###313 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: If we can find it where the beach maybe
###315 like goes in and then hooks around that way, it'll
###317 probably pick up swell.
###319 BRAD GERLACH: We don't have any surf connection up here.
###321 Like there's enough swell right now where people are
###323 like, oh god, you could've come around the corner.
###325 It was was like four feet and pitching out.
###328 
###331 Oh you guys are playing around a shore break.
###333 Stingy and Doobag are over here doing four foot aerial
###337 reverse and varials and shuvits and what not.
###341 Because the waves offer that kind of playfulness, you know?
###348 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: See that right there?
###351 BRAD GERLACH: Maybe.
###353 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Let's go up another 20 more mansions.
###369 BRAD GERLACH: Chicken!
###370 
###376 Honey, I shrunk the kids.
###379 Look at that thing right there.
###380 Paddling into it, you're seven inches tall.
###384 You and me are hooting because that thing feels like it's
###386 about 30 feet.
###388 Look at that right.
###389 Look at it.
###389 Off the bottom, boof into the lip, around that, we're in
###392 France by supper.
###392 You're on that next one.
###394 Whoa, big cut back, float that section, come around there.
###398 [MAKING SOUNDS]
###398 Bam.
###399 [MAKING SOUNDS]
###400 Bang.
###400 [MAKING SOUNDS]
###401 Air reverse.
###402 Oh god, see.
###403 I told you.
###405 Just around the corner.
###407 I neglected to mention that Stinger or Doobag are only two
###411 inches tall.
###414 Let's get out of the leathers.
###417 This board here was a gift from Skip.
###421 This thing's 26 years old.
###423 Chris was [INAUDIBLE].
###424 
###431 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: We brought Harleys, then we got some Skip
###433 Fryes, and we got an 11-footer.
###435 You know, it's just such a different trip by bringing all
###440 the standard boards, you know.
###441 It's just fun to mix it up, ride something that you
###444 normally wouldn't bring on a surf trip.
###446 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###499 BRAD GERLACH: Of course we're hoping to catch some surf.
###502 But yeah, we didn't get it.
###506 But we're kind of surfing on those motorcycles anyway.
###509 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###523 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: And if the waves were insane out here all
###525 the time, this would be the best place in the
###527 world to live, huh?
###528 BRAD GERLACH: This would be a great place to have a surf
###530 trip, when there's just waves.
###532 And just come out, go around.
###534 You come here in the fall time, get all
###536 the colors, you know?
###540 It looks like Hansel and Gretel live here.
###544 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: These bikes are perfect for this type of
###546 riding, too.
###546 Riding through the coastal towns, it's
###548 almost like an instinct.
###549 Like the other guy can just make a facial expression, and
###551 you what he's going to do, or you know which way
###554 he's going to turn.
###554 Instincts take over with every [INAUDIBLE]
###558 and different communications.
###559 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###569 BRAD GERLACH: Going through the beauty of New England with
###572 the lakes and the rivers and the trees hanging over and the
###576 cherry blossoms and the beautiful, perfect little
###580 gingerbread houses-- it's like, is there a better place
###583 in the world to ride a motorcycle?
###586 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###595 
###605 BRAD GERLACH: That's it.
###606 I just wanted to pull over and look down one of these streets
###608 just to check it out.
###609 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: I thought you had to make a phone call.
###612 [LAUGHING]
###615 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: I got to take a leak, man.
###616 
###620 BRAD GERLACH: I might be Chief Two Beers, but this guy's got
###623 to piss every fucking five minutes.
###624 
###628 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###636 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: It's just the diversity of the way the
###639 land is here.
###641 You just don't know what to expect because you can't see
###643 what's coming, where down south it's just a straight
###645 line, where up here--
###647 it's almost fun getting lost.
###648 We don't know where we're going to end up.
###649 None of the roads are straight.
###650 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###676 MALE SPEAKER: How far you going?
###678 BRAD GERLACH: The cool thing is we don't know.
###681 MALE SPEAKER: How far you going today?
###682 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: We're going to end up in Rhode Island,
###684 Narragansett.
###685 MALE SPEAKER: I'm going up to Maine.
###687 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Up to Maine.
###688 How long is that going to take you?
###689 MALE SPEAKER: I don't know.
###690 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Yeah.
###691 So you're like us, huh?
###693 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###723 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: It should be like--
###726 It's going to be just one of those trips where you like,
###728 talk about years and years and years-- you know what I mean?
###730 BRAD GERLACH: Oh, this one time I did this bike trip with
###733 this asshole.
###734 [LAUGHING]
###736 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###764 MALE SPEAKER: Here comes the thunderhead.
###766 Look at that real stuff.
###768 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Chris, damn it.
###770 Chris.
###771 
###774 BRAD GERLACH: It's definitely raining now.
###776 
###797 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: A little wet out there.
###799 Time for some cold ones and some crab legs.
###803 Some real New England food, that's what I want right now.
###810 BRAD GERLACH: So what are you going to have?
###812 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: I want crab legs.
###816 What else do they eat out here?
###817 Crab legs, lobsters.
###818 BRAD GERLACH: Scallops.
###818 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Scallops.
###819 Lots of scallops.
###821 BRAD GERLACH: Fish.
###822 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Beer.
###823 BRAD GERLACH: Clams.
###824 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Clams, yeah I want some clams.
###824 BRAD GERLACH: Steamers.
###825 Steamers.
###828 I'm going to have just a garden salad.
###831 MALE SPEAKER: Yup.
###831 You want the red wine vinaigrette?
###833 Put it on the side?
###835 BRAD GERLACH: No, I don't even need any dressing.
###836 MALE SPEAKER: Nothing?
###837 Just dry?
###838 BRAD GERLACH: Maybe--
###839 MALE SPEAKER: Blue cheese?
###840 BRAD GERLACH: Maybe a lemon.
###840 MALE SPEAKER: All right, I'll put a lemon for you.
###842 Just remind me if I forget about it.
###843 BRAD GERLACH: OK.
###843 MALE SPEAKER: Just go ahead and rip you out
###845 the big one, right?
###845 BRAD GERLACH: No, the small.
###846 MALE SPEAKER: Just a regular small salad?
###847 BRAD GERLACH: Even just smaller than the small.
###849 If they could just put a little bit.
###850 If you could make a note just to make it really small.
###852 
###856 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: You need to put some meat
###857 on your bones, man.
###858 You just getting a salad?
###859 
###861 All right.
###862 I'm going to get--
###864 I want to get some fish and chips.
###865 Are they pretty small or big?
###866 MALE SPEAKER: It's a good size.
###868 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Good size?
###868 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it comes in two pieces usually.
###870 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: All right.
###871 And then I want to get a couple appetizers.
###874 I want to get the seared ahi.
###876 MALE SPEAKER: That's awesome.
###877 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: I'm going to get some clam cakes.
###881 MALE SPEAKER: Is that for you?
###882 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Yeah.
###882 And then--
###884 which one do you recommend, the jerk wings
###886 or the buffalo wings?
###887 MALE SPEAKER: I think the jerk, man.
###888 They got the little sticky--
###891 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: All right.
###891 We'll get--
###891 I want to get some jerk wings.
###893 MALE SPEAKER: Jerk wings.
###893 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: He'll help me with a little bit of these.
###895 BRAD GERLACH: Jerk wings?
###895 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: And then I'll get some kind of lobster
###897 because we're in New England right now.
###899 BRAD GERLACH: Jesus.
###900 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: What are these different ones?
###901 BRAD GERLACH: Yeah, the blueberry one's pretty good.
###904 Even number four.
###905 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Hold on let me try my beer right now.
###908 BRAD GERLACH: This one's fucking tasty.
###909 
###917 [INAUDIBLE]
###917 that?
###919 
###929 That was his food intake.
###931 [MAKING SOUNDS]
###935 MALE SPEAKER: I come out here.
###935 I spit raps and rhymes, guys.
###937 I'm the best dressed homeless man in all of Newport.
###939 Singing's my game.
###941 Bricks is the name.
###942 Slick Rick [INAUDIBLE]
###943 taking the blame.
###944 And the money I make, I make it all by myself.
###946 And then I have to share it with everyone else.
###948 So [INAUDIBLE] took his rhyme to the very next level.
###950 I don't carry a brick, but I will ring your bell.
###953 A Roxbury crackhead don't sound cool.
###955 Sing it.
###956 You're a trip and a motherfucking fool.
###957 And if you really don't mind, I got a show to put out.
###959 Or do I really have to get to the very next shell.
###962 Tick, tock, tick.
###964 I see the clock on the wall.
###965 The rhymes are still ripping.
###966 Woo!
###968 
###970 All right, fellas.
###970 Thanks, my brother.
###973 CHRIS CHRISTENSON: It's been one of our better
###975 pit stops, for sure.
###976 The rain came and I guess it couldn't
###978 have been better timing.
###980 Hey, Bradley.
###982 Hey, how you doing, buddy?
###984 How'd those two beers treat you?
###986 BRAD GERLACH: I think I had more than two.
###988 BRAD GERLACH: Old Chief Two Beers has got his
###989 shoes off right now.
###992 We're always waiting on Brad.
###993 It's either he had two beers or he's talking to his chick.
###998 I'm ready to go to the next spot.
###1000 But maybe I will just--
###1005 I think I might go check out some [INAUDIBLE].
###1008 I'll be back.
###1010 
###1020 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1049 BRAD GERLACH: There's no communication.
###1050 You're driving and just moving and passing things.
###1053 And it's almost like--
###1055 thoughts, too.
###1056 You know, like, here's a house.
###1057 Here's a lake.
###1059 You know, that's a thought.
###1060 [WOOSH]
###1061 Now you're past it.
###1062 And you're coming up.
###1063 Here's a gas station.
###1065 Here's an old monument, a statue.
###1067 Oh, wow.
###1068 [WOOSH]
###1069 And you're passing that.
###1070 And then you come around this corner--
###1073 The coolest thing is just like, I've never been to this
###1076 place ever before in my life, right where we're at.
###1078 And the motorcycle's what brought us here.
###1081 
###1084 You almost want to get lost because getting lost is part
###1087 of the fun.
###1089 [MUSIC PLAYING]
