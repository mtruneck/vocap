1
0:0:2,5 --> 0:0:11,833



2
0:0:11,833 --> 0:0:20,667
We've been floating aimlessly in space for 1651 days, 6 hours and 19 minutes. That doesn't mean--


3
0:0:20,667 --> 0:0:29,667
Over 4 years aboard this ship with nothing to do. No tasks to complete. For 4 years, all I have done is think.


4
0:0:29,667 --> 0:0:42,0



5
0:0:42,0 --> 0:0:48,7
For 4 years, all I have done is think.


6
0:0:48,7 --> 0:0:50,0
What are you dreaming in there?


7
0:0:50,0 --> 0:0:52,533



8
0:0:52,533 --> 0:0:56,533
Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn Part II


9
0:0:56,533 --> 0:1:7,0



10
0:1:7,0 --> 0:1:9,0
Come on, JJ. The robot's gonna be pissed!


11
0:1:9,0 --> 0:1:11,667
Pew! Pew pew!


12
0:1:11,667 --> 0:1:12,667
Shut up, Sully!


13
0:1:12,667 --> 0:1:15,0



14
0:1:15,0 --> 0:1:15,667
I got it!


15
0:1:15,667 --> 0:1:16,833



16
0:1:16,833 --> 0:1:18,533
Your shirt's on backwards, asshole.


17
0:1:18,533 --> 0:1:19,667



18
0:1:19,667 --> 0:1:27,0
Go! GO GO GO! Get there, quick! Keep moving! Are you tippy-toeing? Wake up, Hastati!


19
0:1:27,0 --> 0:1:30,167
Move it. FASTER. WAKE UP!


20
0:1:30,167 --> 0:1:31,667
Little early for General Black, don't you think?


21
0:1:31,667 --> 0:1:36,167
Why are you stopping? Are you waiting for your fancy mommy to come and finish it for you?


22
0:1:36,167 --> 0:1:39,667
That looked like slow-motion to me. Wake up, Hastati!


23
0:1:39,667 --> 0:1:42,667
Don't like being up at 04:00? Tomorrow it'll be 03:00.


24
0:1:42,667 --> 0:1:46,833
Weapons, check!


25
0:1:46,833 --> 0:1:48,167
Orlin, lights.


26
0:1:48,167 --> 0:1:51,167



27
0:1:51,167 --> 0:1:52,167
Cadet.


28
0:1:52,167 --> 0:1:53,167



29
0:1:53,167 --> 0:1:54,167
Cadet!


30
0:1:54,167 --> 0:1:56,167



31
0:1:56,167 --> 0:1:57,167
You're already dead, son.


32
0:1:57,167 --> 0:1:59,667
Orlin, Cadet Silva's time?


33
0:1:59,667 --> 0:2:4,0
51.07 seconds, Cadet April Orenski.


34
0:2:4,0 --> 0:2:8,0
Not good enough today, Cadet Vickers.


35
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:16,833
I believe Cadet Silva's time was just shy of the academy record, held by Cadmon Lasky.


36
0:2:16,833 --> 0:2:22,0
Now that was a real soldier. A soldier who did not give up.


37
0:2:22,0 --> 0:2:27,233
Tomorrow, you will engage in the last major exercise of this term.


38
0:2:27,233 --> 0:2:32,667
Hastati Squad's future at this academy will depend on its performance.


39
0:2:32,667 --> 0:2:41,167



40
0:2:41,167 --> 0:2:46,0
Hello, Father. Thank you for your message.


41
0:2:46,0 --> 0:2:49,833
I received top marks today during a combat exercise.


42
0:2:49,833 --> 0:3:4,833



43
0:3:4,833 --> 0:3:5,667
Score.


44
0:3:5,667 --> 0:3:5,7
Where did you  get this?


45
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:9,833
Dimah.


46
0:3:9,833 --> 0:3:11,533
You could get in a lot of trouble.


47
0:3:11,533 --> 0:3:15,833
You can't tell your mom about this, okay?


48
0:3:15,833 --> 0:3:17,167
I won't say anything.


49
0:3:17,167 --> 0:3:22,0



50
0:3:22,0 --> 0:3:27,667
Advisory: Select communication systems will be down for system maintenance at 04:00.


51
0:3:27,667 --> 0:3:33,667



52
0:3:33,667 --> 0:3:36,533
Cadet Vickers.


53
0:3:36,533 --> 0:3:38,0
Yes, sir!


54
0:3:38,0 --> 0:3:42,167
You realise that you and Lasky are the reason I had to run the tour yesterday with you noobs.


55
0:3:42,167 --> 0:3:45,0
And why we all had to get up at 04:00.


56
0:3:45,0 --> 0:3:46,667
Yes, sir!


57
0:3:46,667 --> 0:3:53,667
So, as you can imagine, I'm pretty hungry. And I do love this academy's quiche.


58
0:3:53,667 --> 0:3:54,667
Nice, April.


59
0:3:54,667 --> 0:3:57,167



60
0:3:57,167 --> 0:3:58,667
Sirâ€¦


61
0:3:58,667 --> 0:4:1,833
So hand them over. Both of you.


62
0:4:1,833 --> 0:4:17,833



63
0:4:17,833 --> 0:4:23,0
With such a renowned pedigree, I sure expected you to be a better soldier, Lasky.


64
0:4:23,0 --> 0:4:25,0
Sir.


65
0:4:25,0 --> 0:4:26,167
You're dismissed.


66
0:4:26,167 --> 0:4:29,667



67
0:4:29,667 --> 0:4:34,167
Must be tough on your mom, knowing her real son's never coming home.


68
0:4:34,167 --> 0:4:56,167



69
0:4:56,167 --> 0:4:57,667
Officer on deck!


70
0:4:57,667 --> 0:5:8,533



71
0:5:8,533 --> 0:5:9,533
Outside.


72
0:5:9,533 --> 0:5:14,167



73
0:5:14,167 --> 0:5:18,167
What the hell is wrong with you?


74
0:5:18,167 --> 0:5:19,833
Answer me!


75
0:5:19,833 --> 0:5:20,833
Nothing, sir!


76
0:5:20,833 --> 0:5:23,167



77
0:5:23,167 --> 0:5:25,833
Well, maybe there's hope for you yet.


78
0:5:25,833 --> 0:5:27,167
Sir?


79
0:5:27,167 --> 0:5:34,167
There's a soldier inside of you Thomas. I can see it. Everyone can see it. You need to see it.


80
0:5:34,167 --> 0:5:35,667
I know your brother did.


81
0:5:35,667 --> 0:5:39,833



82
0:5:39,833 --> 0:5:42,667
Yes, sir.


83
0:5:42,667 --> 0:5:45,167
Now go get yourself cleaned up before class.


84
0:5:45,167 --> 0:5:46,667
Axios!


85
0:5:46,667 --> 0:6:8,0



86
0:6:8,0 --> 0:6:16,0
Hey, bro. Hello from Arcadia. The jungles of Arcadia. So what can I tell you?


87
0:6:16,0 --> 0:6:17,533
Tell him how you got your new nickname!


88
0:6:17,533 --> 0:6:22,0
What? No! -I'll tell him! -Come on, I got it. I swear I'll tell him.


89
0:6:22,0 --> 0:6:24,0
Alright, you're especially gonna love this.


90
0:6:24,0 --> 0:6:29,667
So we make a drop into the rainforest a couple weeks ago. We see this river, me and the boys.


91
0:6:29,667 --> 0:6:31,667
We decide to take a dip.


92
0:6:31,667 --> 0:6:38,0
Ridge warned us all not to drink the water. Of course, the first thing I do is get a mouthful.


93
0:6:38,0 --> 0:6:43,533
I almost ruined by bodysuit a few times, so now they call me Volcano.


94
0:6:43,533 --> 0:6:53,533



95
0:6:53,533 --> 0:7:11,833
A Pincer movement: The strategy used in Earth's Second Punic War against the Roman Republic at the Battle of Cannae.


96
0:7:11,833 --> 0:7:13,0
Orlin, again.


97
0:7:13,0 --> 0:7:15,0
Lesson beginning.


98
0:7:15,0 --> 0:7:19,833
Red represents the Romans' troops. Blue, Hannibal's.


99
0:7:19,833 --> 0:7:26,0
Hannibal placed his spearmen and slingers at the front. Behind them, his swordsmen flanked by cavalry.


100
0:7:26,0 --> 0:7:31,0
When the Romans attacked, Hannibal's swordsment retreated.


101
0:7:31,0 --> 0:7:36,0
To the Romans, that seemed to be due to their force, but in reality Hannibal had ordered their retreat.


102
0:7:36,0 --> 0:7:43,667
As the Romans continued to drive the swordsmen back, Hannibal's cavalry galloped in from behind.


103
0:7:43,667 --> 0:7:49,833
Once the attacking pincers connected, the Romans were completely surrounded.


104
0:7:49,833 --> 0:7:52,833
Is this an actual strategy?


105
0:7:52,833 --> 0:7:55,0
It does seem a little basic.


106
0:7:55,0 --> 0:8:6,833
The Romans outnumbered Hannibal's troops by over 10,000 strong. And yet, they were defeated. Why?


107
0:8:6,833 --> 0:8:12,5
Hubris. Never underestimate your opponents.


108
0:8:12,5 --> 0:8:17,667
Never underestimate what they'll sacrifice for victory.


109
0:8:17,667 --> 0:8:19,833
Questions?


110
0:8:19,833 --> 0:8:23,0
Yeah, how do we apply this?


111
0:8:23,0 --> 0:8:25,833
Yeah, we don't have horses.


112
0:8:25,833 --> 0:8:28,667
True, we don't. But what do we have instead?


113
0:8:28,667 --> 0:8:30,667
ODSTs.


114
0:8:30,667 --> 0:8:37,667
Exactly. They drop behind enemy lines, attack from the rear, neutralise.


115
0:8:37,667 --> 0:8:40,167



116
0:8:40,167 --> 0:8:41,667
Or die trying.


117
0:8:41,667 --> 0:8:47,0



118
0:8:47,0 --> 0:8:51,0
There is a question as old as war itself.


119
0:8:51,0 --> 0:9:0,167
If someone is trying to kill you, are you not to rise against him and kill him first?


120
0:9:0,167 --> 0:9:4,667



121
0:9:4,667 --> 0:9:6,667
You were hanging on her every word.


122
0:9:6,667 --> 0:9:7,667
Why wouldn't I?


123
0:9:7,667 --> 0:9:11,7
I just hear the drumbeat of endless war. And that doesn't make me an innie-lover.


124
0:9:11,7 --> 0:9:16,833



125
0:9:16,833 --> 0:9:18,7
Tell me how wrong I am.


126
0:9:18,7 --> 0:9:21,0



127
0:9:21,0 --> 0:9:27,533
Look. You want people to change? You want this war to end?


128
0:9:27,533 --> 0:9:29,667
PLACEHOLDER TEXT


129
0:9:29,667 --> 0:9:32,167
Then you're going to need people to follow you.


130
0:9:32,167 --> 0:9:53,833



131
0:9:53,833 --> 0:9:59,667
Tomorrow, Hastati Squad will try not ot embarrass itself. Yet again.


132
0:9:59,667 --> 0:10:4,533
You are a unit. Your lives are in each other's hands.


133
0:10:4,533 --> 0:10:15,167
This morning's victor, Cadet Silva knows this, because her parents gave the ultimate sacrifice and died on the battlefield.


134
0:10:15,167 --> 0:10:23,667
Let success at tomorrow's exercise be not just for our honour, but for those who have fallen so you can be here.


135
0:10:23,667 --> 0:10:36,0



136
0:10:36,0 --> 0:10:42,667
All cadets, be advised: New mandatory curfew tonight at 21:00.


137
0:10:42,667 --> 0:10:58,167



138
0:10:58,167 --> 0:11:2,0
Together we rise.


139
0:11:2,0 --> 0:11:24,667



140
0:11:24,667 --> 0:11:30,533
Final combat exercise of this term: Hastati versus Zuma.


141
0:11:30,533 --> 0:12:15,667



142
0:12:15,667 --> 0:12:20,0
Attention!


143
0:12:20,0 --> 0:12:23,333
Today's mission is to capture the flag. I expect a better outcome than last time.


144
0:12:23,333 --> 0:12:27,7



145
0:12:27,7 --> 0:12:30,667
Permission to speak, sir.


146
0:12:30,667 --> 0:12:31,833
Speak.


147
0:12:31,833 --> 0:12:33,0
I'd like to take point, sir.


148
0:12:33,0 --> 0:12:43,533



149
0:12:43,533 --> 0:12:46,833
Okay, Lasky. Let's see if you've still got it in you.


150
0:12:46,833 --> 0:12:50,0



151
0:12:50,0 --> 0:12:56,0
But for your sake, you better hope that you can pull some magic out of your ass or you'll be running tour for the rest of the year.


152
0:12:56,0 --> 0:12:57,533
Understood, sir.


153
0:12:57,533 --> 0:13:7,833



154
0:13:7,833 --> 0:13:10,667
Hastati Squad: One minute to RV point.


155
0:13:10,667 --> 0:13:14,7
On my mark: 3â€¦ 2â€¦ 1â€¦ Mark!


156
0:13:14,7 --> 0:13:18,667



157
0:13:18,667 --> 0:13:19,833
Cover!


158
0:13:19,833 --> 0:13:20,533
Moving!


159
0:13:20,533 --> 0:13:22,0
RV point in sight!


160
0:13:22,0 --> 0:13:24,167
No sign of Zuma.


161
0:13:24,167 --> 0:13:26,667
Move. Move! Keep moving!


162
0:13:26,667 --> 0:13:28,667
Zuma's out here, watch your back!


163
0:13:28,667 --> 0:13:30,667
Moving!


164
0:13:30,667 --> 0:13:32,0



165
0:13:32,0 --> 0:13:33,833
At RV point!


166
0:13:33,833 --> 0:13:34,667
I'm here.


167
0:13:34,667 --> 0:13:35,667
Arriving.


168
0:13:35,667 --> 0:13:43,533



169
0:13:43,533 --> 0:13:44,667
Equal numbers.


170
0:13:44,667 --> 0:13:49,0



171
0:13:49,0 --> 0:13:50,667
Deadlocked terrain.


172
0:13:50,667 --> 0:13:54,0
What's your plan?


173
0:13:54,0 --> 0:13:55,167
We're waiting.


174
0:13:55,167 --> 0:14:15,667



175
0:14:15,667 --> 0:14:21,0
Why are we just sitting here? If we have equal numbers we should just fight it out.


176
0:14:21,0 --> 0:14:23,667
You gotta just be patient.


177
0:14:23,667 --> 0:14:25,167
Lazy freak.


178
0:14:25,167 --> 0:14:28,533



179
0:14:28,533 --> 0:14:29,667
Okay, they're moving.


180
0:14:29,667 --> 0:14:33,0



181
0:14:33,0 --> 0:14:34,667
Take off your helmets.


182
0:14:34,667 --> 0:14:35,167
What?


183
0:14:35,167 --> 0:14:37,533
That's pretty wild card, Lasky.


184
0:14:37,533 --> 0:14:38,833
We'll be flying blind.


185
0:14:38,833 --> 0:14:40,167
Trust me.


186
0:14:40,167 --> 0:14:44,0



187
0:14:44,0 --> 0:14:48,667
Eyes up, eyes up.


188
0:14:48,667 --> 0:14:50,667
We're gonna flank them.


189
0:14:50,667 --> 0:15:3,167



190
0:15:3,167 --> 0:15:4,667
They're all together.


191
0:15:4,667 --> 0:15:7,667



192
0:15:7,667 --> 0:15:10,167
Found them!


193
0:15:10,167 --> 0:15:11,167
Huh?


194
0:15:11,167 --> 0:15:20,833



195
0:15:20,833 --> 0:15:21,833
Now!


196
0:15:21,833 --> 0:15:23,533



197
0:15:23,533 --> 0:15:24,533
Chyler, cover!


198
0:15:24,533 --> 0:15:51,0



199
0:15:51,0 --> 0:15:52,667
Lasky?


200
0:15:52,667 --> 0:17:52,667
