###1 JONATHAN BENNO: I'm not accustomed to--
###3 I've always done these kinds of interviews or cooking
###8 segments, they're always very brief.
###11 Like when we made the pasta.
###12 It's demo a couple of dishes and it's over.
###15 Tell me about your career and it's over.
###17 But last night was a little challenging for me at points.
###20 Because we were together for four or five hours.
###27 And four or five hours together with the camera and
###32 you and questions.
###35 You need to keep things going.
###37 And you need to keep asking questions.
###38 And you just keep shooting-- what did you say, 12 minutes--
###43 that is fun and hit all the bases.
###47 Honestly, for me, I wasn't embarrassed
###50 to be with the entourage.
###53 But I felt to stay--
###57 it was a little bit challenging.
###58 
###62 Mm!
###63 
###85 It's a casonsei that has a sweet potato as the filling,
###89 toasted almonds, just a little bit of sherry vinegar.
###93 And then this one we finish with mozzarella
###95 that we smoke in-house.
###97 
###100 My name is Jonathan Benno and I'm the chef at Lincoln
###102 Ristorante.
###105 Lincoln Ristorante is on 65th street, between Amsterdam and
###109 Broadway, right in the Lincoln Center.
###112 With everything that happens up here, there are all the
###115 performing arts houses, it's a pretty
###118 inspirational place to work.
###120 There's been a lot of allusions to being on stage
###124 when you're working on the line at Lincoln.
###127 The kitchen is completely open.
###128 
###131 The food is a modern interpretation of a classic
###137 Italian cuisine.
###140 It doesn't have a regional focus.
###142 The pasta dishes here are very, very popular.
###145 
###148 Where's the strozz?
###149 -Strozz is behind here.
###151 
###159 JONATHAN BENNO: This is a strozzapreti.
###161 So it's another pasta that we make in-house.
###164 It has a little bit of squid ink in it.
###166 That's what gives it the color.
###167 This is probably one of the few--
###170 what we'll call signature pastas at the restaurant.
###174 Strozzapreti means priest strangler.
###176 Strozza, preti, priest.
###180 I never worked in Italy.
###182 I've been lucky enough to travel there.
###184 I'd say, I had a good foundation in pasta making
###187 over the course of the past couple years.
###191 I grew up in Connecticut.
###193 I start washing dishes when I was 15.
###195 I moved out to Hawaii.
###197 I worked out there for a while.
###198 I came back to New York.
###200 I went to the Culinary Institute of America.
###202 I went back out West.
###204 I was lucky enough to work in Napa with Thomas Keller the
###207 first year the French Laundry was open.
###209 I came to New York for about eight years, and worked for
###213 Daniel Boulud.
###215 I was working at Craft with Marco Canora and Tom Colicchio
###219 when the opportunity came up to open Per Se.
###224 I was at Per Se for six years.
###226 I started thinking about what was next.
###229 I knew that I wanted to do
###230 something completely different.
###234 I've always been passionate about Italian food.
###237 And I've always loved going to Italy, and learning about the
###241 culture and the cuisine.
###243 I've tried to take everything that I've learned up until
###247 this point, and and apply it here.
###249 
###253 Here we are now, two years later, with a restaurant that
###258 has a firm identity and a strong following.
###262 The restaurant knows who it is and what it is and what it
###268 wants to be for, what you can imagine, is a
###271 very diverse clientele.
###272 
###279 You told me to pick a restaurant that I really
###282 wanted to go eat at.
###283 I've been dying to go to Nick Kim's restaurant, Neta, in the
###287 West Village.
###288 
###294 I know Nick probably for eight years now, since he opened
###297 Masa and we opened Per Se.
###300 The two guys that joined me for dinner--
###303 Chung Chow and Dominick Tesoriero.
###307 Chung, I met out in California, when he was a cook
###310 at Bouchon and I went back out to work at the French Laundry,
###313 and then was one of the opening sous chefs here.
###317 Dominick is a real character.
###319 DOMINICK TESORIERO: I'm still a [INAUDIBLE].
###322 JONATHAN BENNO: He was probably with us for about six
###323 months, and comes back often, and helps us with off-site
###327 events, and things.
###329 Chung is from Hawaii.
###330 And I think we share certainly a passion for fish and sushi.
###334 
###341 NICK KIM: Neta, for us, means fresh ingredients, what's
###345 available now versus when it's not in season.
###348 So we're very seasonal driven.
###350 Simple, honest.
###353 And right now what Jimmy is doing is breaking down the
###356 collar piece.
###357 A lot of the restaurants will basically just cut right
###360 through it.
###361 But we take the time to remove each layer.
###364 And what we do with the sinew is we'll marinate it.
###366 And then we'll grill it.
###367 And we'll make sinew sushi.
###369 
###374 -Here we have beautiful, fresh dungeness crab salad with some
###380 cucumber, wild parsley, and a dashi vinaigrette.
###383 
###387 JONATHAN BENNO: One of the really beautiful things about
###389 eating like that is it always leaves you wanting more.
###392 That two to three bites, and you wish there
###395 was a fourth bite.
###396 But by the time you realize that there's no fourth bite,
###399 the next course is already coming to the table.
###401 
###410 It's almost the kind of meal, and the kind of experience,
###412 where you really want to be quiet.
###414 And you really want to think about what you're eating.
###418 And I think you pick up on that pretty quickly.
###422 
###428 NICK KIM: We cook things very lightly, so when you taste
###430 things it's very gentle.
###433 Like this scallop dish, for example.
###436 Scallop's warm, foie gras is hot.
###439 And the uni is room temperature-ish.
###443 Our soy sauce that we age in a bourbon cask.
###448 JONATHAN BENNO: If you had said to me warm foie gras, sea
###452 urchin, scallop, I wouldn't connect those dots myself.
###456 But the way that he did it--
###459 definitely one of the best things that I'd ever had.
###462 
###467 Although I was full--
###469 not like overstuffed but perfect at
###472 the end of the meal--
###473 it was one of those meals that I didn't want it to end.
###477 
###481 I remember the first time I ate at the French Laundry,
###483 feeling the same way.
###485 Thank you very much.
###487 What Nick and his team are doing there, they really stand
###490 out in my mind as one of the best meals that I've ever had.
###495 
###501 After that we went to probably one of my
###503 favorite bars in the city--
###505 Peter McManus Cafe.
###506 
###514 My wife is a chef as well.
###516 That was always kind of our rendezvous point.
###518 We would meet there, and have a beer together.
###521 INTERVIEWER: Would you say it's a hard thing to bring a
###522 camera to your favorite bar?
###524 JONATHAN BENNO: That was kind of a funny location.
###526 People want to see what's going on, and who is that.
###529 Why is there a camera?
###531 I've lived in that neighborhood for a long time,
###533 and I know those guys very, very well.
###535 
###539 For me to be out at McManus at midnight was surreal, almost.
###545 My wife and I moved up to Westchester recently.
###547 We have two little girls.
###548 I started bobbing a little bit towards the end, because for
###552 me to be out--
###553 it's just funny.
###554 I guess I'm getting older.
###556 
###567 The dish I chose to make for the real munchie--
###572 I love sandwiches.
###575 I'm crazy about sandwiches.
###578 I always have been.
###580 I also love to work with tripe.
###582 So what we did was we took the honeycomb tripe and braised it
###585 whole, until it was tender.
###587 And then cut it into cutlet-size pieces, breaded
###593 it, and fried it.
###594 
###597 So it was a tripe cutlet on our country bread with lemon
###604 aoli, B&G hot peppers, pickled red onions, and arugula.
###608 
###613 DOMINICK TESORIERO: Amazing.
###614 Sometimes, life is really grand--
###619 just sometimes.
###621 JONATHAN BENNO: Cheers.
###624 DOMINICK TESORIERO: Chung.
###625 CHUNG CHOW: Cheers it up.
###628 JONATHAN BENNO: You drove, right?
###631 DOMINICK TESORIERO: I did.
###633 CHUNG CHOW: This is so good.
###634
