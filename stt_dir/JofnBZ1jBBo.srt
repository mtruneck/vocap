1
0:0:1,714 --> 0:0:3,685
Zeus,


2
0:0:3,685 --> 0:0:5,487
Surya,


3
0:0:5,487 --> 0:0:7,726
Thor,


4
0:0:7,726 --> 0:0:9,366
For thousands of years


5
0:0:9,366 --> 0:0:11,958
ancient mits have described gods


6
0:0:11,958 --> 0:0:13,91
who came down from the heavens.


7
0:0:13,91 --> 0:0:15,294
Always you have someone


8
0:0:15,294 --> 0:0:17,862
who is descending from the sky


9
0:0:17,862 --> 0:0:19,839
with loud noise,


10
0:0:19,839 --> 0:0:23,557
with thundering,
with fire, with smoke.


11
0:0:23,557 --> 0:0:24,662
They would have come the most


12
0:0:24,662 --> 0:0:26,68
powerful and magical place


13
0:0:26,68 --> 0:0:28,737
possible... from the stars.


14
0:0:28,737 --> 0:0:30,205
NARRATOR: But just who were


15
0:0:30,205 --> 0:0:31,874
these mystical beings that


16
0:0:31,874 --> 0:0:32,975
ruled the skies with


17
0:0:32,975 --> 0:0:34,777
supernatural powers?


18
0:0:34,777 --> 0:0:35,711
David CHILDRESS: You could


19
0:0:35,711 --> 0:0:38,213
wonder if these tales of Zeus's


20
0:0:38,213 --> 0:0:40,282
thunderbolts, Thor's hammer,


21
0:0:40,282 --> 0:0:43,85
if these weren't real weapons.


22
0:0:43,85 --> 0:0:44,286
NARRATOR: Did our ancient


23
0:0:44,286 --> 0:0:46,288
ancestors create the gods from


24
0:0:46,288 --> 0:0:48,223
their own imaginations?


25
0:0:48,223 --> 0:0:49,825
Or did they simply report


26
0:0:49,825 --> 0:0:52,594
events they believed to be true?


27
0:0:52,594 --> 0:0:53,962
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS: Our


28
0:0:53,962 --> 0:0:56,832
ancestors misinterpreted


29
0:0:56,832 --> 0:0:58,901
extraterrestrials as gods,


30
0:0:58,901 --> 0:1:1,7
because that is was the only way


31
0:1:1,7 --> 0:1:2,471
that they could explain away


32
0:1:2,471 --> 0:1:4,573
what they witnessed.


33
0:1:4,573 --> 0:1:5,974
NARRATOR: Millions of people


34
0:1:5,974 --> 0:1:7,91
around the world believe we have


35
0:1:7,91 --> 0:1:9,845
been visited in the past by


36
0:1:9,845 --> 0:1:10,913
extraterrestrial beings.


37
0:1:10,913 --> 0:1:14,416
What if it were true?


38
0:1:14,416 --> 0:1:16,85
Did ancient aliens really help


39
0:1:16,85 --> 0:1:18,253
to shape our history?


40
0:1:18,253 --> 0:1:20,255
And were the gods of


41
0:1:20,255 --> 0:1:22,524
our ancestors actually visitors


42
0:1:22,524 --> 0:1:26,451
from other worlds?

44
0:1:56,759 --> 0:1:59,361
NARRATOR: Truva, Turkey.


45
0:1:59,361 --> 0:2:1,597
For over 150 years, this small


46
0:2:1,597 --> 0:2:3,866
city has been the center of one


47
0:2:3,866 --> 0:2:5,367
of the greatest archaeological


48
0:2:5,367 --> 0:2:8,237
finds in modern history: the


49
0:2:8,237 --> 0:2:10,105
possible discovery of the


50
0:2:10,105 --> 0:2:16,378
legendary city of Troy.


51
0:2:16,378 --> 0:2:19,481
In 1868, amateur archaeologist


52
0:2:19,481 --> 0:2:21,984
Heinrich Schliemann, set out to


53
0:2:21,984 --> 0:2:23,619
find what he believed was the


54
0:2:23,619 --> 0:2:25,287
city that served as the basis


55
0:2:25,287 --> 0:2:27,89
for the Trojan War, as described


56
0:2:27,89 --> 0:2:29,792
in one of the greatest pieces of


57
0:2:29,792 --> 0:2:31,827
classical literature, Homer's


58
0:2:31,827 --> 0:2:34,897
epic poem, the Iliad.


59
0:2:34,897 --> 0:2:37,9
Written in the eighth century


60
0:2:37,9 --> 0:2:40,469
BC, Homer's Iliad tells the


61
0:2:40,469 --> 0:2:42,738
tale of a great war, born of


62
0:2:42,738 --> 0:2:45,73
feuding and jealous gods.


63
0:2:45,73 --> 0:2:47,476
While most scholars believed


64
0:2:47,476 --> 0:2:49,411
the story of the Trojan War was


65
0:2:49,411 --> 0:2:51,747
a work of fiction, Schliemann


66
0:2:51,747 --> 0:2:53,415
was determined to prove the


67
0:2:53,415 --> 0:2:57,85
myth was a reality.


68
0:2:57,85 --> 0:2:58,287
Richard RADER: Heinrich


69
0:2:58,287 --> 0:2:59,755
Schliemann's discoveries rocked


70
0:2:59,755 --> 0:3:1,49
the archaeological world.


71
0:3:1,49 --> 0:3:3,492
Armed with his copy of the


72
0:3:3,492 --> 0:3:6,28
Iliad, basically, he just


73
0:3:6,28 --> 0:3:7,696
decided that he was gonna find


74
0:3:7,696 --> 0:3:8,864
Troy.


75
0:3:8,864 --> 0:3:12,401
And so he went and just dug a


76
0:3:12,401 --> 0:3:15,537
big hole, and when he went, he


77
0:3:15,537 --> 0:3:25,814
discovered the real Troy.


78
0:3:25,814 --> 0:3:28,25
NARRATOR: But if Homer's


79
0:3:28,25 --> 0:3:30,452
story of Troy was true, what


80
0:3:30,452 --> 0:3:32,387
would it say about other Greek


81
0:3:32,387 --> 0:3:34,556
stories and myths?


82
0:3:34,556 --> 0:3:38,494
Might those also be true?


83
0:3:38,494 --> 0:3:40,929
Did powerful gods and goddesses


84
0:3:40,929 --> 0:3:44,66
actually exist?


85
0:3:44,66 --> 0:3:47,302
And, if so, where did they come


86
0:3:47,302 --> 0:3:52,474
from?


87
0:3:52,474 --> 0:3:55,978
Hellas, also known as Greece.


88
0:3:55,978 --> 0:3:58,981
Each day, thousands of tourists


89
0:3:58,981 --> 0:4:1,49
visit temples and monuments


90
0:4:1,49 --> 0:4:2,384
built to honor the gods of


91
0:4:2,384 --> 0:4:4,553
another age.


92
0:4:4,553 --> 0:4:7,756
The Acropolis...


93
0:4:7,756 --> 0:4:10,492
Delphi...


94
0:4:10,492 --> 0:4:13,462
The Parthenon...


95
0:4:13,462 --> 0:4:15,664
The Temple of Apollo.


96
0:4:15,664 --> 0:4:18,467
These ancient sites reflect a


97
0:4:18,467 --> 0:4:20,469
powerful reverence for beings


98
0:4:20,469 --> 0:4:22,738
that supposedly ruled the world


99
0:4:22,738 --> 0:4:27,91
thousands of years ago.


100
0:4:27,91 --> 0:4:29,645
CHILDRESS: When you look at


101
0:4:29,645 --> 0:4:32,14
many of the mythologies around


102
0:4:32,14 --> 0:4:33,649
the world, they have these


103
0:4:33,649 --> 0:4:36,818
stories of gods coming down from


104
0:4:36,818 --> 0:4:40,455
the sky.


105
0:4:40,455 --> 0:4:41,99
RADER: There's a beautiful


106
0:4:41,99 --> 0:4:43,625
description of the way that the


107
0:4:43,625 --> 0:4:45,16
gods move, like, when they kind


108
0:4:45,16 --> 0:4:46,862
of come down to the Earth.


109
0:4:46,862 --> 0:4:48,163
You get the sense of them


110
0:4:48,163 --> 0:4:50,32
gliding down, but the way that


111
0:4:50,32 --> 0:4:52,167
they move is kind of beyond


112
0:4:52,167 --> 0:4:53,201
time.


113
0:4:53,201 --> 0:4:54,703
It just kind of happens.


114
0:4:54,703 --> 0:4:55,938
NARRATOR: If the ancient


115
0:4:55,938 --> 0:4:57,506
Greeks invented the stories of


116
0:4:57,506 --> 0:5:0,8
gods as a primitive attempt to


117
0:5:0,8 --> 0:5:2,544
explain their universe, how can


118
0:5:2,544 --> 0:5:4,446
we account for similar deities


119
0:5:4,446 --> 0:5:6,48
found in widely different


120
0:5:6,48 --> 0:5:7,683
regions and cultures around the


121
0:5:7,683 --> 0:5:10,218
globe?


122
0:5:10,218 --> 0:5:12,87
Was it mere coincidence?


123
0:5:12,87 --> 0:5:14,289
Or was there a common origin


124
0:5:14,289 --> 0:5:16,858
for these gods, who supposedly


125
0:5:16,858 --> 0:5:18,694
traveled to Earth from the


126
0:5:18,694 --> 0:5:26,802
skies?


127
0:5:26,802 --> 0:5:27,97
Jason MARTELL: The earliest


128
0:5:27,97 --> 0:5:30,572
civilization we have, 3800 BC,


129
0:5:30,572 --> 0:5:32,474
the Sumerians actually give us


130
0:5:32,474 --> 0:5:33,709
visual descriptions of these


131
0:5:33,709 --> 0:5:35,544
beings and speak of this time


132
0:5:35,544 --> 0:5:36,878
that they lived amongst their


133
0:5:36,878 --> 0:5:38,46
living gods.


134
0:5:38,46 --> 0:5:39,314
They called their gods the


135
0:5:39,314 --> 0:5:40,916
Annunaki and that term simply


136
0:5:40,916 --> 0:5:42,217
meant "those who from heaven


137
0:5:42,217 --> 0:5:44,219
come to earth."


138
0:5:44,219 --> 0:5:45,587
RADER: Mythology is chock...


139
0:5:45,587 --> 0:5:47,189
full of these episodes of gods


140
0:5:47,189 --> 0:5:48,89
coming down to earth.


141
0:5:48,89 --> 0:5:50,225
I mean, because mythology is so


142
0:5:50,225 --> 0:5:52,194
interested in the relationship


143
0:5:52,194 --> 0:5:53,662
between gods and humans, there


144
0:5:53,662 --> 0:5:54,896
is necessarily gonna be a lot


145
0:5:54,896 --> 0:5:56,832
of communication, and communion


146
0:5:56,832 --> 0:5:59,768
between the two of them.


147
0:5:59,768 --> 0:6:1,536
NARRATOR: In his 2000 book,


148
0:6:1,536 --> 0:6:4,239
Odyssey of the Gods, Erich Von


149
0:6:4,239 --> 0:6:6,241
D Niken argues that the world's


150
0:6:6,241 --> 0:6:7,809
sacred books are full of


151
0:6:7,809 --> 0:6:10,245
descriptions, not of gods, but


152
0:6:10,245 --> 0:6:12,514
of supernatural beings


153
0:6:12,514 --> 0:6:15,5
interacting with humans.


154
0:6:15,5 --> 0:6:16,518
Von D NIKEN: Some thousands


155
0:6:16,518 --> 0:6:18,153
of years ago, when our


156
0:6:18,153 --> 0:6:19,154
forefathers were still


157
0:6:19,154 --> 0:6:20,722
primitive, some


158
0:6:20,722 --> 0:6:22,57
extraterrestrials descended to


159
0:6:22,57 --> 0:6:23,325
our planet.


160
0:6:23,325 --> 0:6:25,894
And because of misunderstanding,


161
0:6:25,894 --> 0:6:27,763
like of technology, our


162
0:6:27,763 --> 0:6:29,731
forefathers thought that these


163
0:6:29,731 --> 0:6:32,934
extraterrestrials must be some


164
0:6:32,934 --> 0:6:37,506
gods.


165
0:6:37,506 --> 0:6:40,242
NARRATOR: Mount Olympus.


166
0:6:40,242 --> 0:6:43,378
Greece's highest mountain.


167
0:6:43,378 --> 0:6:46,14
According to ancient myths,


168
0:6:46,14 --> 0:6:47,849
this site was the home of the


169
0:6:47,849 --> 0:6:48,85
gods.


170
0:6:48,85 --> 0:6:51,353
(thunder crashes)


171
0:6:51,353 --> 0:6:53,855
It was here, on Mount Olympus,


172
0:6:53,855 --> 0:6:55,59
that Zeus sat on his throne and


173
0:6:55,59 --> 0:6:57,526
determined the fate of


174
0:6:57,526 --> 0:7:0,262
mortal men.


175
0:7:0,262 --> 0:7:1,93
TSOUKALOS: Whenever we have


176
0:7:1,93 --> 0:7:4,99
references to Mount Olympus, it


177
0:7:4,99 --> 0:7:7,35
is described to be this


178
0:7:7,35 --> 0:7:10,138
magnificent palace on top of


179
0:7:10,138 --> 0:7:13,41
Mount Olympus allegedly, and the


180
0:7:13,41 --> 0:7:15,377
temple walls were always


181
0:7:15,377 --> 0:7:17,212
gleaming of gold, or gleaming


182
0:7:17,212 --> 0:7:19,214
with silver, and a lot of little


183
0:7:19,214 --> 0:7:22,317
lights that they described as


184
0:7:22,317 --> 0:7:23,318
jewels.


185
0:7:23,318 --> 0:7:26,121
Well, if you look at that


186
0:7:26,121 --> 0:7:27,789
from modern perspective,


187
0:7:27,789 --> 0:7:31,293
what if that place... Mount


188
0:7:31,293 --> 0:7:33,595
Olympus... wasn't necessarily the


189
0:7:33,595 --> 0:7:35,597
top of a mountain, but it was,


190
0:7:35,597 --> 0:7:39,334
in fact, a spaceship, because it


191
0:7:39,334 --> 0:7:41,169
is described how sometimes there


192
0:7:41,169 --> 0:7:43,105
was a big rumbling with Mount


193
0:7:43,105 --> 0:7:45,64
Olympus, and the entire top


194
0:7:45,64 --> 0:7:48,744
lifted off.


195
0:7:48,744 --> 0:7:50,579
NARRATOR: But if Mount


196
0:7:50,579 --> 0:7:52,581
Olympus was home to alien


197
0:7:52,581 --> 0:7:54,116
visitors, could Zeus have been


198
0:7:54,116 --> 0:7:55,584
their leader?


199
0:7:55,584 --> 0:7:57,819
According to both the Iliad and


200
0:7:57,819 --> 0:8:0,322
the Odyssey, Zeus was often


201
0:8:0,322 --> 0:8:1,957
depicted as wielding a


202
0:8:1,957 --> 0:8:3,992
lightning bolt.


203
0:8:3,992 --> 0:8:5,694
CREMO: It appears to be a


204
0:8:5,694 --> 0:8:9,3
very powerful weapon because he


205
0:8:9,3 --> 0:8:12,334
could destroy whole cities with


206
0:8:12,334 --> 0:8:15,67
this thunderbolt weapon of his.


207
0:8:15,67 --> 0:8:17,405
NARRATOR: Similarly, Zeus's


208
0:8:17,405 --> 0:8:18,974
brother Poseidon, the God of


209
0:8:18,974 --> 0:8:20,842
the sea, was armed with a


210
0:8:20,842 --> 0:8:22,144
trident.


211
0:8:22,144 --> 0:8:24,613
CREMO: He was able to create


212
0:8:24,613 --> 0:8:27,149
tsunamis, tidal waves with this


213
0:8:27,149 --> 0:8:28,683
weapon.


214
0:8:28,683 --> 0:8:32,554
The trident weapon of Poseidon


215
0:8:32,554 --> 0:8:35,323
seems to have been something


216
0:8:35,323 --> 0:8:38,46
more than just a pitchfork.


217
0:8:38,46 --> 0:8:40,28
TSOUKALOS: So is it possible


218
0:8:40,28 --> 0:8:41,93
that the lightning bolt and


219
0:8:41,93 --> 0:8:45,333
the trident is some type of a


220
0:8:45,333 --> 0:8:50,605
direct energy device?


221
0:8:50,605 --> 0:8:52,274
NARRATOR: Arguably, one of


222
0:8:52,274 --> 0:8:54,342
the most important of the Greek


223
0:8:54,342 --> 0:8:57,612
gods was Apollo, who rode the


224
0:8:57,612 --> 0:9:0,15
skies in his chariot of fire.


225
0:9:0,15 --> 0:9:1,683
Von D NIKEN: Apollo first


226
0:9:1,683 --> 0:9:3,819
was the teacher of the young


227
0:9:3,819 --> 0:9:5,62
Greeks living there.


228
0:9:5,62 --> 0:9:8,123
He teach them how to make


229
0:9:8,123 --> 0:9:10,58
buildings on the mountain, on


230
0:9:10,58 --> 0:9:11,626
the hillside.


231
0:9:11,626 --> 0:9:13,228
He teach them how to make roads.


232
0:9:13,228 --> 0:9:16,498
He teach them in astronomy.


233
0:9:16,498 --> 0:9:18,9
NARRATOR: Centuries later,


234
0:9:18,9 --> 0:9:20,969
when Rome ruled over Europe and


235
0:9:20,969 --> 0:9:22,47
the Mediterranean, from the


236
0:9:22,47 --> 0:9:24,973
first century BC until the


237
0:9:24,973 --> 0:9:27,642
seventh century AD, the Romans


238
0:9:27,642 --> 0:9:28,977
paid homage to gods similar to


239
0:9:28,977 --> 0:9:31,179
the Greeks.


240
0:9:31,179 --> 0:9:35,784
Zeus was now known as Jupiter.


241
0:9:35,784 --> 0:9:40,188
Poseidon was called Neptune.


242
0:9:40,188 --> 0:9:42,39
But Apollo was known to both


243
0:9:42,39 --> 0:9:44,459
the Romans and the Greeks.


244
0:9:44,459 --> 0:9:46,294
Coincidence?


245
0:9:46,294 --> 0:9:48,63
Or, as most ancient astronaut


246
0:9:48,63 --> 0:9:50,866
theorists believe, was it the


247
0:9:50,866 --> 0:9:52,634
historical account of powerful


248
0:9:52,634 --> 0:9:54,2
beings that came to Earth


249
0:9:54,2 --> 0:9:55,3
thousands of years ago?


250
0:9:55,3 --> 0:9:58,6
(neighing)


251
0:9:58,6 --> 0:9:59,374
MARTELL: We know that the


252
0:9:59,374 --> 0:10:0,642
extraterrestrials more than


253
0:10:0,642 --> 0:10:1,91
likely are the source of what


254
0:10:1,91 --> 0:10:3,211
they call gods.


255
0:10:3,211 --> 0:10:4,646
How did they get here?


256
0:10:4,646 --> 0:10:6,181
More than likely in some type of


257
0:10:6,181 --> 0:10:7,215
craft.


258
0:10:7,215 --> 0:10:9,17
Philip COPPENS: What we map


259
0:10:9,17 --> 0:10:11,186
into our myths and our legends


260
0:10:11,186 --> 0:10:13,321
are incredible stories,


261
0:10:13,321 --> 0:10:15,23
incredible events, and any


262
0:10:15,23 --> 0:10:16,858
extraterrestrial being, any


263
0:10:16,858 --> 0:10:19,16
ancient alien who has come here


264
0:10:19,16 --> 0:10:21,329
on Earth, will be written down


265
0:10:21,329 --> 0:10:23,398
into this account because it is


266
0:10:23,398 --> 0:10:24,866
such an extraordinary event that


267
0:10:24,866 --> 0:10:27,369
it'll be marked forever.


268
0:10:27,369 --> 0:10:28,637
NARRATOR: But if the stories


269
0:10:28,637 --> 0:10:30,71
of Greek and Roman gods are


270
0:10:30,71 --> 0:10:32,507
true, can evidence of their


271
0:10:32,507 --> 0:10:34,175
existence be found in other


272
0:10:34,175 --> 0:10:36,711
parts of the globe?


273
0:10:36,711 --> 0:10:45,383
And, if so, where did they go?


274
0:10:45,383 --> 0:10:46,918
NARRATOR: On the northwest


275
0:10:46,918 --> 0:10:49,2
coast of France, just South of


276
0:10:49,2 --> 0:10:51,22
Brittany, lies one of the e most


277
0:10:51,22 --> 0:10:52,657
important prehistoric sites in


278
0:10:52,657 --> 0:10:56,228
Europe.


279
0:10:56,228 --> 0:10:57,295
At the seaside village of


280
0:10:57,295 --> 0:11:0,365
Carnac, over 3,000 megalithic


281
0:11:0,365 --> 0:11:2,67
stones are placed in rows over


282
0:11:2,67 --> 0:11:5,47
two miles long.


283
0:11:5,47 --> 0:11:8,406
The Carnac stones were hewn from


284
0:11:8,406 --> 0:11:9,741
local rock formations and


285
0:11:9,741 --> 0:11:13,245
erected between 4,500 to 2,500


286
0:11:13,245 --> 0:11:17,182
BC, at the end of the Stone Age.


287
0:11:17,182 --> 0:11:19,451
They are the largest collection


288
0:11:19,451 --> 0:11:20,485
of standing stones in the


289
0:11:20,485 --> 0:11:24,956
world.


290
0:11:24,956 --> 0:11:26,825
CHILDRESS: Archaeologists are


291
0:11:26,825 --> 0:11:28,793
baffled by the many megaliths at


292
0:11:28,793 --> 0:11:30,795
Carnac here.


293
0:11:30,795 --> 0:11:33,231
It's clearly a massive


294
0:11:33,231 --> 0:11:36,434
construction project with blocks


295
0:11:36,434 --> 0:11:39,471
of granite weighing 50 to 100,


296
0:11:39,471 --> 0:11:44,476
to even up to 350 tons.


297
0:11:44,476 --> 0:11:46,912
Legends here say that giants


298
0:11:46,912 --> 0:11:49,514
built Carnac, but you have to


299
0:11:49,514 --> 0:11:51,816
wonder, what is the real purpose


300
0:11:51,816 --> 0:11:54,519
of these giant megaliths, and


301
0:11:54,519 --> 0:11:57,689
why would prehistoric people


302
0:11:57,689 --> 0:12:1,826
have moved all of these massive


303
0:12:1,826 --> 0:12:3,662
stones and placed them in the


304
0:12:3,662 --> 0:12:8,66
many alignments here at Carnac?


305
0:12:8,66 --> 0:12:10,101
CREMO: Thousands of large


306
0:12:10,101 --> 0:12:13,104
stones have been arranged in


307
0:12:13,104 --> 0:12:15,173
very interesting patterns.


308
0:12:15,173 --> 0:12:16,741
They're arranged in intersecting


309
0:12:16,741 --> 0:12:20,378
lines that form triangles that


310
0:12:20,378 --> 0:12:25,817
could only be visible from above


311
0:12:25,817 --> 0:12:27,886
the Earth.


312
0:12:27,886 --> 0:12:30,822
These arrangements of stones


313
0:12:30,822 --> 0:12:33,358
may have been a way of


314
0:12:33,358 --> 0:12:34,526
communicating with


315
0:12:34,526 --> 0:12:38,563
extraterrestrial beings.


316
0:12:38,563 --> 0:12:40,98
NARRATOR: The ancient Greek


317
0:12:40,98 --> 0:12:42,4
poet Pindar spoke of a mystical


318
0:12:42,4 --> 0:12:44,402
land called Hyperborea, far to


319
0:12:44,402 --> 0:12:47,72
the north, where the sun shined


320
0:12:47,72 --> 0:12:52,43
24 hours a day.


321
0:12:52,43 --> 0:12:54,279
Legends claim that Apollo


322
0:12:54,279 --> 0:12:56,548
visited Hyperborea, traveling in


323
0:12:56,548 --> 0:12:58,45
his chariot of fire every


324
0:12:58,45 --> 0:13:0,952
20 years.


325
0:13:0,952 --> 0:13:1,953
TSOUKALOS: Apollo would tell


326
0:13:1,953 --> 0:13:3,688
to the Greeks, "Okay, I've got


327
0:13:3,688 --> 0:13:5,69
to go see some other people.


328
0:13:5,69 --> 0:13:7,525
"I've got to go and teach them."


329
0:13:7,525 --> 0:13:8,56
And they're, like, "Well, where


330
0:13:8,56 --> 0:13:9,561
are you off to?"


331
0:13:9,561 --> 0:13:10,695
And he's, like, "Well, I'm


332
0:13:10,695 --> 0:13:11,997
actually going to a place that's


333
0:13:11,997 --> 0:13:14,132
beyond where the north wind


334
0:13:14,132 --> 0:13:15,133
comes.


335
0:13:15,133 --> 0:13:16,301
It's the land of the


336
0:13:16,301 --> 0:13:19,304
"Hyperboreans."


337
0:13:19,304 --> 0:13:20,638
NARRATOR: Although mainstream


338
0:13:20,638 --> 0:13:22,307
archaeologists speculate that


339
0:13:22,307 --> 0:13:24,109
the Carnac stones are most


340
0:13:24,109 --> 0:13:25,81
likely tomb markers, ancient


341
0:13:25,81 --> 0:13:28,313
astronaut theorists believe


342
0:13:28,313 --> 0:13:30,48
these stones are intentionally


343
0:13:30,48 --> 0:13:32,17
laid out in a unique geometric


344
0:13:32,17 --> 0:13:34,419
formation.


345
0:13:34,419 --> 0:13:35,52
Von D NIKEN: Many


346
0:13:35,52 --> 0:13:37,55
speculations existed since


347
0:13:37,55 --> 0:13:39,124
centuries, and only a few years


348
0:13:39,124 --> 0:13:41,326
ago, in France, they started to


349
0:13:41,326 --> 0:13:43,495
photograph this whole French


350
0:13:43,495 --> 0:13:45,897
Brittany by helicopters.


351
0:13:45,897 --> 0:13:47,132
And when they put the pictures


352
0:13:47,132 --> 0:13:49,67
together, all of a sudden,


353
0:13:49,67 --> 0:13:50,969
someone realized, hey, this is


354
0:13:50,969 --> 0:13:52,37
not coincidence.


355
0:13:52,37 --> 0:13:54,672
The distances of the lines are


356
0:13:54,672 --> 0:13:59,544
always the same... 2,860 meters.


357
0:13:59,544 --> 0:14:2,13
Or exactly the half of 2,860


358
0:14:2,13 --> 0:14:6,885
meters.


359
0:14:6,885 --> 0:14:10,121
The angles are always the same.


360
0:14:10,121 --> 0:14:13,58
It's Pythagorean triangles.


361
0:14:13,58 --> 0:14:15,6
It's all a gigantic


362
0:14:15,6 --> 0:14:17,28
geometrical pattern.


363
0:14:17,28 --> 0:14:19,397
From Stone Age, which


364
0:14:19,397 --> 0:14:20,598
is impossible.


365
0:14:20,598 --> 0:14:22,5
Our Stone Age people had no idea


366
0:14:22,5 --> 0:14:25,67
of Pythagoras' triangles.


367
0:14:25,67 --> 0:14:28,606
Pythagoras was about 420 BC.


368
0:14:28,606 --> 0:14:31,176
NARRATOR: Even though the


369
0:14:31,176 --> 0:14:32,777
geometric arrangement of the


370
0:14:32,777 --> 0:14:34,946
Carnac stones predates the


371
0:14:34,946 --> 0:14:36,614
Pythagorean theorem by more


372
0:14:36,614 --> 0:14:40,652
than 2,000 years, one question


373
0:14:40,652 --> 0:14:43,154
remains:


374
0:14:43,154 --> 0:14:45,523
Why were the stones arranged in


375
0:14:45,523 --> 0:14:47,892
such a precise pattern?


376
0:14:47,892 --> 0:14:48,893
CHILDRESS: The Carnac stones


377
0:14:48,893 --> 0:14:50,795
are one of the few things on the


378
0:14:50,795 --> 0:14:52,497
planet that can actually be seen


379
0:14:52,497 --> 0:14:54,32
from space.


380
0:14:54,32 --> 0:14:55,733
And they're a perfect marker for


381
0:14:55,733 --> 0:14:57,569
any kind of aerial vehicle


382
0:14:57,569 --> 0:15:2,4
looking down on the Earth.


383
0:15:2,4 --> 0:15:3,975
Many of the tourists w who com


384
0:15:3,975 --> 0:15:6,44
here to Carnac claim that they


385
0:15:6,44 --> 0:15:8,48
can actually feel the energy


386
0:15:8,48 --> 0:15:10,315
emanating from these granite


387
0:15:10,315 --> 0:15:12,584
megaliths.


388
0:15:12,584 --> 0:15:14,319
How did these ancient people


389
0:15:14,319 --> 0:15:17,155
know about this energy?


390
0:15:17,155 --> 0:15:19,224
Is it possible that they were


391
0:15:19,224 --> 0:15:22,494
able to use this energy to even


392
0:15:22,494 --> 0:15:24,295
move and erect these giant


393
0:15:24,295 --> 0:15:27,65
stones?


394
0:15:27,65 --> 0:15:28,466
Von D NIKEN: I am of the


395
0:15:28,466 --> 0:15:30,835
opinion that they were made on


396
0:15:30,835 --> 0:15:32,47
purpose.


397
0:15:32,47 --> 0:15:35,73
The extraterrestrials told our


398
0:15:35,73 --> 0:15:38,71
ancestor: do this and this.


399
0:15:38,71 --> 0:15:40,211
It's not the extraterrestrials


400
0:15:40,211 --> 0:15:42,18
who made the stone lines.


401
0:15:42,18 --> 0:15:44,682
It's the humans who made it,


402
0:15:44,682 --> 0:15:46,5
but by the order of the


403
0:15:46,5 --> 0:15:50,722
extraterrestrials.


404
0:15:50,722 --> 0:15:52,23
NARRATOR: But were the Carnac


405
0:15:52,23 --> 0:15:54,25
stones a signpost for an ancient


406
0:15:54,25 --> 0:15:56,427
astronaut called Apollo, as he


407
0:15:56,427 --> 0:15:58,997
flew his spacecraft high above


408
0:15:58,997 --> 0:16:3,434
the land?


409
0:16:3,434 --> 0:16:5,103
CHILDRESS: If the Greek God


410
0:16:5,103 --> 0:16:7,539
Apollo was really some kind of


411
0:16:7,539 --> 0:16:10,375
ancient astronaut, it's possible


412
0:16:10,375 --> 0:16:12,277
that the stones here at Carnac


413
0:16:12,277 --> 0:16:14,78
were a directional finder


414
0:16:14,78 --> 0:16:16,314
pointing the way to the far


415
0:16:16,314 --> 0:16:18,65
north, to the Hyperborea of the


416
0:16:18,65 --> 0:16:27,892
ancient gods.


417
0:16:27,892 --> 0:16:29,494
NARRATOR: Over 1,000 miles


418
0:16:29,494 --> 0:16:31,429
north of Carnac lies


419
0:16:31,429 --> 0:16:34,332
Scandinavia, home to an ancient


420
0:16:34,332 --> 0:16:36,935
people called the Norse.


421
0:16:36,935 --> 0:16:39,103
The Norse were tribal Germanic


422
0:16:39,103 --> 0:16:41,606
people who lived in what is now


423
0:16:41,606 --> 0:16:43,441
known as Sweden, Denmark,


424
0:16:43,441 --> 0:16:47,412
Iceland and Norway.


425
0:16:47,412 --> 0:16:49,38
Norse legends record the


426
0:16:49,38 --> 0:16:51,182
triumphs of great warriors with


427
0:16:51,182 --> 0:16:53,518
advanced weaponry, sophisticated


428
0:16:53,518 --> 0:16:55,486
combat techniques s and


429
0:16:55,486 --> 0:16:57,388
navigational p prowess.


430
0:16:57,388 --> 0:17:0,491
Like the Greeks, Norse mythology


431
0:17:0,491 --> 0:17:3,161
includes supernatural beings,


432
0:17:3,161 --> 0:17:10,134
other worlds and powerful gods.


433
0:17:10,134 --> 0:17:12,537
But like the Romans, could the


434
0:17:12,537 --> 0:17:14,405
Norse myths refer not to


435
0:17:14,405 --> 0:17:16,7
different gods, but the same


436
0:17:16,7 --> 0:17:17,542
gods as those depicted by the


437
0:17:17,542 --> 0:17:19,544
ancient Greeks?


438
0:17:19,544 --> 0:17:21,412
CHILDRESS: There are a number


439
0:17:21,412 --> 0:17:24,15
of similarities between Greek


440
0:17:24,15 --> 0:17:25,85
mythology and Norse mythology.


441
0:17:25,85 --> 0:17:28,186
And many of the gods are, uh,


442
0:17:28,186 --> 0:17:29,687
almost identical.


443
0:17:29,687 --> 0:17:31,589
And they do much the same thing.


444
0:17:31,589 --> 0:17:34,425
(thunder cracks, rumbles)


445
0:17:34,425 --> 0:17:35,426
NARRATOR: Descriptions of the


446
0:17:35,426 --> 0:17:37,428
Viking God Odin... the God of


447
0:17:37,428 --> 0:17:39,43
war, death and knowledge...


448
0:17:39,43 --> 0:17:41,699
and the Greek God Zeus, bear


449
0:17:41,699 --> 0:17:44,269
striking similarities.


450
0:17:44,269 --> 0:17:46,7
Jonathan YOUNG: Zeus and


451
0:17:46,7 --> 0:17:52,443
Odin are both sky father gods.


452
0:17:52,443 --> 0:17:54,78
They travel through the skies


453
0:17:54,78 --> 0:17:55,847
in chariots because they are


454
0:17:55,847 --> 0:17:58,216
akin to the solar, uh,


455
0:17:58,216 --> 0:17:59,25
divinities.


456
0:17:59,25 --> 0:18:2,22
The precursor to many, uh,


457
0:18:2,22 --> 0:18:3,688
religious beliefs is sun


458
0:18:3,688 --> 0:18:4,522
worship.


459
0:18:4,522 --> 0:18:6,124
The ancients knew that life came


460
0:18:6,124 --> 0:18:7,58
from the sun.


461
0:18:7,58 --> 0:18:9,861
So that is a great mystery and


462
0:18:9,861 --> 0:18:15,867
a source of great awe.


463
0:18:15,867 --> 0:18:17,201
COPPENS: What you're getting


464
0:18:17,201 --> 0:18:18,536
there is not just some minor


465
0:18:18,536 --> 0:18:19,537
deity, but you really are


466
0:18:19,537 --> 0:18:21,39
nailing it down to one of the


467
0:18:21,39 --> 0:18:23,41
chief deities.


468
0:18:23,41 --> 0:18:24,342
This is a very important


469
0:18:24,342 --> 0:18:25,43
character.


470
0:18:25,43 --> 0:18:26,744
And so whoever is behind Odin


471
0:18:26,744 --> 0:18:29,347
or Zeus is obviously a person,


472
0:18:29,347 --> 0:18:32,55
or a divine entity, which is


473
0:18:32,55 --> 0:18:34,686
shared by these cultures.


474
0:18:34,686 --> 0:18:36,854
And it's clear that whoever


475
0:18:36,854 --> 0:18:39,57
inspired the myth of Zeus or


476
0:18:39,57 --> 0:18:42,6
Odin is somehow somebody who had


477
0:18:42,6 --> 0:18:43,227
an extremely important


478
0:18:43,227 --> 0:18:44,629
contribution to make to both


479
0:18:44,629 --> 0:18:45,763
civilizations.


480
0:18:45,763 --> 0:18:48,7
So this entity was definitely


481
0:18:48,7 --> 0:18:54,105
known throughout Europe.


482
0:18:54,105 --> 0:18:55,473
NARRATOR: Ancient alien


483
0:18:55,473 --> 0:18:57,141
theorists also point to


484
0:18:57,141 --> 0:18:58,576
similarities between the


485
0:18:58,576 --> 0:19:0,111
sophisticated weapons possessed


486
0:19:0,111 --> 0:19:1,913
by both the Norse and the Greek


487
0:19:1,913 --> 0:19:2,914
gods.


488
0:19:2,914 --> 0:19:5,483
Among Odin's weapons was a spear


489
0:19:5,483 --> 0:19:8,92
that never missed its target.


490
0:19:8,92 --> 0:19:10,888
The Norse God Thor, God of


491
0:19:10,888 --> 0:19:13,491
storms, strength and fertility,


492
0:19:13,491 --> 0:19:16,928
wielded a powerful hammer.


493
0:19:16,928 --> 0:19:17,895
TSOUKALOS: Right there we


494
0:19:17,895 --> 0:19:18,896
have a correlation, a


495
0:19:18,896 --> 0:19:20,598
connection, because not only


496
0:19:20,598 --> 0:19:22,333
does Zeus have the thunderbolt,


497
0:19:22,333 --> 0:19:24,902
but what does Odin have?


498
0:19:24,902 --> 0:19:25,737
And Thor?


499
0:19:25,737 --> 0:19:27,972
They have a hammer.


500
0:19:27,972 --> 0:19:29,741
Thor has a hammer with which he


501
0:19:29,741 --> 0:19:31,476
can smash things, destroy


502
0:19:31,476 --> 0:19:33,711
things, and, you know, the


503
0:19:33,711 --> 0:19:37,482
hammer idea is pretty close with


504
0:19:37,482 --> 0:19:39,817
the description to the lightning


505
0:19:39,817 --> 0:19:43,488
rod that Zeus has.


506
0:19:43,488 --> 0:19:44,622
CHILDRESS: So you have to


507
0:19:44,622 --> 0:19:45,923
wonder if these tales of Zeus's


508
0:19:45,923 --> 0:19:48,493
thunderbolts, Thor's hammer...


509
0:19:48,493 --> 0:19:51,929
if these weren't real weapons,


510
0:19:51,929 --> 0:19:54,31
just like we have today, where


511
0:19:54,31 --> 0:19:56,234
we have directed energy-beam


512
0:19:56,234 --> 0:19:58,836
weapons, or are developing some


513
0:19:58,836 --> 0:20:1,105
kind of literal thunderbolt


514
0:20:1,105 --> 0:20:4,342
coming out of a spacecraft.


515
0:20:4,342 --> 0:20:7,612
(weapons zapping)


516
0:20:7,612 --> 0:20:11,416
(wind whistling)


517
0:20:11,416 --> 0:20:12,583
NARRATOR: But such


518
0:20:12,583 --> 0:20:14,619
similarities are not limited o


519
0:20:14,619 --> 0:20:17,355
the Greek and Norse myths.


520
0:20:17,355 --> 0:20:19,724
In India, the ancient epic of


521
0:20:19,724 --> 0:20:22,26
the Mahabharata describes


522
0:20:22,26 --> 0:20:23,628
visitations from gods that


523
0:20:23,628 --> 0:20:24,896
possessed the advanced


524
0:20:24,896 --> 0:20:27,598
technology of space travel.


525
0:20:27,598 --> 0:20:29,0
Von D NIKEN: There you can


526
0:20:29,0 --> 0:20:30,868
read, some thousands of years


527
0:20:30,868 --> 0:20:34,172
ago, gigantic cities surrounded


528
0:20:34,172 --> 0:20:35,173
our planet.


529
0:20:35,173 --> 0:20:36,941
They used the word "cities,"


530
0:20:36,941 --> 0:20:38,609
because they had no word for


531
0:20:38,609 --> 0:20:40,511
"mother spaceship."


532
0:20:40,511 --> 0:20:42,513
And of a sudden, out of these


533
0:20:42,513 --> 0:20:44,782
cities, smaller spacecrafts


534
0:20:44,782 --> 0:20:46,317
came out.


535
0:20:46,317 --> 0:20:48,152
Of course, in ancient India,


536
0:20:48,152 --> 0:20:49,253
they had no word like


537
0:20:49,253 --> 0:20:51,289
"spacecraft," so they called it


538
0:20:51,289 --> 0:20:56,794
"Vimana."


539
0:20:56,794 --> 0:20:58,262
>> NARRATOR: The ancient texts


540
0:20:58,262 --> 0:21:0,131
of the Hebrew Bible also


541
0:21:0,131 --> 0:21:2,133
describes a prophet who traveled


542
0:21:2,133 --> 0:21:3,634
the skies in a sophisticated


543
0:21:3,634 --> 0:21:7,338
machine.


544
0:21:7,338 --> 0:21:9,674
>> Von D NIKEN: Who is Enoch?


545
0:21:9,674 --> 0:21:12,61
He was the seventh antediluvian


546
0:21:12,61 --> 0:21:15,313
prophet in the Old Testament,


547
0:21:15,313 --> 0:21:16,647
including the Torah of the


548
0:21:16,647 --> 0:21:18,549
Jewish community.


549
0:21:18,549 --> 0:21:20,518
Enoch is only described with two


550
0:21:20,518 --> 0:21:22,62
phrases, that's all.


551
0:21:22,62 --> 0:21:24,222
And it says that the Lord took


552
0:21:24,222 --> 0:21:26,123
him away in a fiery chariot


553
0:21:26,123 --> 0:21:29,694
into the heaven.


554
0:21:29,694 --> 0:21:31,95
>> NARRATOR: But technology was


555
0:21:31,95 --> 0:21:32,763
not the only characteristic


556
0:21:32,763 --> 0:21:34,499
these ancient deities had in


557
0:21:34,499 --> 0:21:35,5
common.


558
0:21:35,5 --> 0:21:37,502
According to legends, the gods


559
0:21:37,502 --> 0:21:39,303
enjoyed intimate relations with


560
0:21:39,303 --> 0:21:40,505
humans.


561
0:21:40,505 --> 0:21:42,507
But if aliens did choose human


562
0:21:42,507 --> 0:21:45,409
women as their sexual partners,


563
0:21:45,409 --> 0:21:47,345
what was their motivation?


564
0:21:47,345 --> 0:21:49,58
And just what was the outcome of


565
0:21:49,58 --> 0:22:0,69
these very close encounters?


566
0:22:0,69 --> 0:22:1,737
NARRATOR: Ancient myths are


567
0:22:1,737 --> 0:22:3,5
full of stories of gods


568
0:22:3,5 --> 0:22:4,94
descending to Earth to mate with


569
0:22:4,94 --> 0:22:7,109
humans.


570
0:22:7,109 --> 0:22:8,277
CHILDRESS: According to many


571
0:22:8,277 --> 0:22:9,445
sources, including Norse


572
0:22:9,445 --> 0:22:11,313
mythology, Greek mythology and


573
0:22:11,313 --> 0:22:13,415
even the Bible, we have the


574
0:22:13,415 --> 0:22:16,18
stories of the sons of God,


575
0:22:16,18 --> 0:22:18,354
or actual gods, from Mount


576
0:22:18,354 --> 0:22:20,422
Olympus or Valhalla, and


577
0:22:20,422 --> 0:22:22,625
they're coming to Earth.


578
0:22:22,625 --> 0:22:24,96
They find, uh, the daughters of


579
0:22:24,96 --> 0:22:26,528
men attractive.


580
0:22:26,528 --> 0:22:27,863
TSOUKALOS: When all these


581
0:22:27,863 --> 0:22:29,431
encounters happened, and when


582
0:22:29,431 --> 0:22:32,635
women slept with those gods...


583
0:22:32,635 --> 0:22:35,337
which can be found in multiple


584
0:22:35,337 --> 0:22:40,576
texts all around the planet...


585
0:22:40,576 --> 0:22:43,145
that those women actually had


586
0:22:43,145 --> 0:22:45,481
sex with extraterrestrials,


587
0:22:45,481 --> 0:22:46,949
not with gods.

(thunder crashing, rumbling)


590
0:22:51,453 --> 0:22:52,288
NARRATOR: According to


591
0:22:52,288 --> 0:22:54,523
Homer's Iliad, the citizens of


592
0:22:54,523 --> 0:22:56,125
Sparta were renowned for their


593
0:22:56,125 --> 0:22:57,96
heroic warriors and their


594
0:22:57,96 --> 0:23:0,296
beautiful women.


595
0:23:0,296 --> 0:23:3,299
Zeus, the Greek God of the sky,


596
0:23:3,299 --> 0:23:7,469
admired a human named Leda.


597
0:23:7,469 --> 0:23:9,705
One afternoon, while Leda walked


598
0:23:9,705 --> 0:23:11,64
alone in an orchard, Zeus


599
0:23:11,64 --> 0:23:14,677
changed into a swan, enveloped


600
0:23:14,677 --> 0:23:16,712
her in his powerful wings, and


601
0:23:16,712 --> 0:23:18,28
made love to her.


602
0:23:18,28 --> 0:23:20,683
Only later did Leda realize she


603
0:23:20,683 --> 0:23:24,119
had been impregnated by a God.


604
0:23:24,119 --> 0:23:25,321
CHILDRESS: When you look at


605
0:23:25,321 --> 0:23:27,656
Greek mythology, and many of the


606
0:23:27,656 --> 0:23:29,959
mythologies around the world,


607
0:23:29,959 --> 0:23:32,661
they have these stories of gods


608
0:23:32,661 --> 0:23:35,13
coming down from the sky, and


609
0:23:35,13 --> 0:23:36,732
have sexual intercourse


610
0:23:36,732 --> 0:23:39,501
with these humans, and, in a


611
0:23:39,501 --> 0:23:41,904
sense, create a new breed of


612
0:23:41,904 --> 0:23:46,809
human.


613
0:23:46,809 --> 0:23:47,91
NARRATOR: The offspring of


614
0:23:47,91 --> 0:23:49,712
these couplings were described


615
0:23:49,712 --> 0:23:51,947
by the ancients as demigods, or


616
0:23:51,947 --> 0:23:56,85
half-gods.


617
0:23:56,85 --> 0:23:57,953
Experts suggest demigods were


618
0:23:57,953 --> 0:24:0,189
supernatural hybrid beings of


619
0:24:0,189 --> 0:24:3,926
human and alien origin.


620
0:24:3,926 --> 0:24:5,694
Ancient Greeks believed these


621
0:24:5,694 --> 0:24:8,664
beings were exceptional...


622
0:24:8,664 --> 0:24:9,898
and destined to perform


623
0:24:9,898 --> 0:24:14,303
extraordinary feats.


624
0:24:14,303 --> 0:24:17,306
COPPENS: It is a tradition in


625
0:24:17,306 --> 0:24:19,508
many civilizations that there


626
0:24:19,508 --> 0:24:21,143
were certain human children


627
0:24:21,143 --> 0:24:23,479
who were somehow not human, but


628
0:24:23,479 --> 0:24:25,314
somehow had a connection to the


629
0:24:25,314 --> 0:24:30,19
stars, to a realm beyond Earth.


630
0:24:30,19 --> 0:24:32,321
And this specialness seems to be


631
0:24:32,321 --> 0:24:33,689
there from birth, and it somehow


632
0:24:33,689 --> 0:24:35,491
seems to involve a DNA


633
0:24:35,491 --> 0:24:37,593
component, which maybe science


634
0:24:37,593 --> 0:24:39,94
needs to look at, and needs


635
0:24:39,94 --> 0:24:41,363
to study.


636
0:24:41,363 --> 0:24:42,598
NARRATOR: Some of the oldest


637
0:24:42,598 --> 0:24:44,466
accounts of gods and humans


638
0:24:44,466 --> 0:24:46,635
interbreeding can be found in


639
0:24:46,635 --> 0:24:49,605
ancient Hindu texts.


640
0:24:49,605 --> 0:24:50,572
CREMO: In the ancient


641
0:24:50,572 --> 0:24:52,408
Sanskrit writings of India, we


642
0:24:52,408 --> 0:24:54,576
find this account:


643
0:24:54,576 --> 0:24:58,213
A Queen named Kunti mated with


644
0:24:58,213 --> 0:25:0,516
a celestial being, an


645
0:25:0,516 --> 0:25:2,351
extraterrestrial, who was known


646
0:25:2,351 --> 0:25:4,987
as the sun God.


647
0:25:4,987 --> 0:25:9,91
The product of this mating was


648
0:25:9,91 --> 0:25:11,26
Karna, one of the heroes of the


649
0:25:11,26 --> 0:25:17,733
Indian epic, the Mahabharata.


650
0:25:17,733 --> 0:25:18,901
NARRATOR: Perhaps the most


651
0:25:18,901 --> 0:25:20,569
famous demigod is the Greek


652
0:25:20,569 --> 0:25:22,905
hero Heracles, also known as


653
0:25:22,905 --> 0:25:27,509
the Roman Hercules.


654
0:25:27,509 --> 0:25:31,13
Heracles was half-man/half-god,


655
0:25:31,13 --> 0:25:32,781
conceived in the union of Zeus


656
0:25:32,781 --> 0:25:34,917
and a mortal woman named


657
0:25:34,917 --> 0:25:40,355
Alcmene.


658
0:25:40,355 --> 0:25:42,157
Mainstream scholars have often


659
0:25:42,157 --> 0:25:44,126
dismissed the tales of demigods


660
0:25:44,126 --> 0:25:46,161
as fantasy.


661
0:25:46,161 --> 0:25:48,163
(thunder crashing)


662
0:25:48,163 --> 0:25:50,165
But ancient astronaut theorists


663
0:25:50,165 --> 0:25:52,234
believe they reflect actual


664
0:25:52,234 --> 0:25:56,338
living entities.


665
0:25:56,338 --> 0:25:58,574
CREMO: These types of


666
0:25:58,574 --> 0:26:0,576
accounts in the ancient wisdom


667
0:26:0,576 --> 0:26:3,512
traditions have a modern


668
0:26:3,512 --> 0:26:9,118
equivalent in accounts of alien


669
0:26:9,118 --> 0:26:12,354
terrestrial hybrids, which is


670
0:26:12,354 --> 0:26:14,556
part of the modern UFO alien


671
0:26:14,556 --> 0:26:19,695
abduction type of account.


672
0:26:19,695 --> 0:26:23,232
It's remarkable that we find,


673
0:26:23,232 --> 0:26:26,1
in these modern reports, exact


674
0:26:26,1 --> 0:26:27,402
equivalents in the ancient


675
0:26:27,402 --> 0:26:29,404
accounts.


676
0:26:29,404 --> 0:26:32,541
That suggests that we're


677
0:26:32,541 --> 0:26:35,544
dealing with realities here.


678
0:26:35,544 --> 0:26:37,846
We're not just dealing with


679
0:26:37,846 --> 0:26:40,949
imaginary stories.


680
0:26:40,949 --> 0:26:42,851
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut


681
0:26:42,851 --> 0:26:44,72
theorists say the term "star


682
0:26:44,72 --> 0:26:46,355
children" is another way to


683
0:26:46,355 --> 0:26:48,56
describe the offspring of


684
0:26:48,56 --> 0:26:49,57
humans and ancient


685
0:26:49,57 --> 0:26:51,96
extraterrestrials.


686
0:26:51,96 --> 0:26:53,462
They claim that in the early


687
0:26:53,462 --> 0:26:55,23
traditions of nearly every


688
0:26:55,23 --> 0:26:57,332
major world religion,


689
0:26:57,332 --> 0:26:58,734
"star children" correlate to


690
0:26:58,734 --> 0:26:59,968
supernatural beings known as


691
0:26:59,968 --> 0:27:1,97
"gods."


692
0:27:1,97 --> 0:27:3,572
TSOUKALOS: "Star child" is


693
0:27:3,572 --> 0:27:5,474
an often-used reference in


694
0:27:5,474 --> 0:27:8,21
ancient texts when a woman had


695
0:27:8,21 --> 0:27:9,811
a quote, unquote "divine


696
0:27:9,811 --> 0:27:11,58
interaction" with one of the


697
0:27:11,58 --> 0:27:15,984
gods, often resulting in a woman


698
0:27:15,984 --> 0:27:19,254
being pregnant without having


699
0:27:19,254 --> 0:27:21,59
slept with anyone.


700
0:27:21,59 --> 0:27:24,66
You know, is such a thing even


701
0:27:24,66 --> 0:27:25,761
possible?


702
0:27:25,761 --> 0:27:27,262
Yes, it is.


703
0:27:27,262 --> 0:27:29,398
Today, artificial insemination.


704
0:27:29,398 --> 0:27:31,3
That's what happens today.


705
0:27:31,3 --> 0:27:32,768
You no longer have to have sex


706
0:27:32,768 --> 0:27:34,169
in order to have babies.


707
0:27:34,169 --> 0:27:36,4
We have the exact same


708
0:27:36,4 --> 0:27:38,407
description thousands of years


709
0:27:38,407 --> 0:27:39,775
ago, where women, without


710
0:27:39,775 --> 0:27:42,11
sleeping with anyone, all of a


711
0:27:42,11 --> 0:27:43,979
sudden became pregnant, and the


712
0:27:43,979 --> 0:27:45,747
question is how is that


713
0:27:45,747 --> 0:27:47,82
possible?


714
0:27:47,82 --> 0:27:48,75
NARRATOR: Did aliens that


715
0:27:48,75 --> 0:27:50,285
came to Earth in ancient times


716
0:27:50,285 --> 0:27:51,62
use advanced fertility


717
0:27:51,62 --> 0:27:53,322
technology?


718
0:27:53,322 --> 0:27:55,357
CHILDRESS: Within Greek


719
0:27:55,357 --> 0:27:57,459
mythology you have many strange


720
0:27:57,459 --> 0:28:0,629
stories of centaurs, uh...


721
0:28:0,629 --> 0:28:3,765
cyclops, weird genetically


722
0:28:3,765 --> 0:28:6,301
human, uh, half animal


723
0:28:6,301 --> 0:28:8,67
creations.


724
0:28:8,67 --> 0:28:11,273
And you have to speculate,


725
0:28:11,273 --> 0:28:13,8
at least to a point, that


726
0:28:13,8 --> 0:28:14,309
there's a possibility of


727
0:28:14,309 --> 0:28:16,979
strange genetic engineering


728
0:28:16,979 --> 0:28:19,781
going on here, and creating


729
0:28:19,781 --> 0:28:21,416
what are literal monsters in


730
0:28:21,416 --> 0:28:23,418
the past.


731
0:28:23,418 --> 0:28:25,53
CREMO: In some of the


732
0:28:25,53 --> 0:28:26,88
writings of ancient


733
0:28:26,88 --> 0:28:29,224
civilizations, we see accounts


734
0:28:29,224 --> 0:28:31,994
of mating between


735
0:28:31,994 --> 0:28:34,596
extraterrestrial beings and


736
0:28:34,596 --> 0:28:38,4
humans, producing monsters or


737
0:28:38,4 --> 0:28:41,703
giants or other similar types


738
0:28:41,703 --> 0:28:44,64
of beings.


739
0:28:44,64 --> 0:28:45,874
And why is that?


740
0:28:45,874 --> 0:28:48,343
I believe it's because it has


741
0:28:48,343 --> 0:28:51,48
actually happened in the past.


742
0:28:51,48 --> 0:28:53,81
NARRATOR: Could these ancient


743
0:28:53,81 --> 0:28:55,5
tales of enormous creatures...


744
0:28:55,5 --> 0:28:57,352
half human, half beast...


745
0:28:57,352 --> 0:28:59,354
be rooted in truth?


746
0:28:59,354 --> 0:29:1,69
And if so, is there any


747
0:29:1,69 --> 0:29:3,325
evidence these giant hybrids


748
0:29:3,325 --> 0:29:12,674
really existed?


749
0:29:12,674 --> 0:29:15,51
NARRATOR: Lovelock, Nevada.


750
0:29:15,51 --> 0:29:18,413
In the early 1800s, local


751
0:29:18,413 --> 0:29:19,914
legends passed down by the Piute


752
0:29:19,914 --> 0:29:22,35
Indians told of a race of


753
0:29:22,35 --> 0:29:24,219
giants who were exterminated by


754
0:29:24,219 --> 0:29:27,222
their tribe.


755
0:29:27,222 --> 0:29:29,724
It is said this was done by


756
0:29:29,724 --> 0:29:31,693
trapping the giants in a cave,


757
0:29:31,693 --> 0:29:33,561
shooting arrows at them, and


758
0:29:33,561 --> 0:29:35,563
then starting a large fire at


759
0:29:35,563 --> 0:29:38,399
the mouth of the cave.


760
0:29:38,399 --> 0:29:40,802
Evidence of the slaughter lay


761
0:29:40,802 --> 0:29:43,371
undisturbed until the early 2h


762
0:29:43,371 --> 0:29:50,879
recenty.


763
0:29:50,879 --> 0:29:53,214
CHILDRESS: Lovelock Cave was


764
0:29:53,214 --> 0:29:55,817
first discovered by local


765
0:29:55,817 --> 0:29:57,352
ranchers who were looking for


766
0:29:57,352 --> 0:29:59,22
bat guano to use in their


767
0:29:59,22 --> 0:30:1,222
fields.


768
0:30:1,222 --> 0:30:2,49
NARRATOR: In need of


769
0:30:2,49 --> 0:30:3,992
fertilizer for their crops, the


770
0:30:3,992 --> 0:30:5,36
ranchers removed nearly ten


771
0:30:5,36 --> 0:30:7,495
feet of guano-enriched soil


772
0:30:7,495 --> 0:30:15,47
from the surface of the cave.


773
0:30:15,47 --> 0:30:19,641
They found up to 40 or 50 people


774
0:30:19,641 --> 0:30:23,311
inside this cave.


775
0:30:23,311 --> 0:30:26,14
One was allegedly seven feet,


776
0:30:26,14 --> 0:30:28,817
seven inches tall.


777
0:30:28,817 --> 0:30:32,253
They all had long, red hair and


778
0:30:32,253 --> 0:30:36,324
were literal giants.


779
0:30:36,324 --> 0:30:37,692
NARRATOR: If these skeletons


780
0:30:37,692 --> 0:30:39,494
were the remains of the


781
0:30:39,494 --> 0:30:41,262
legendary red-haired giants,


782
0:30:41,262 --> 0:30:43,264
were they visitors from distant


783
0:30:43,264 --> 0:30:45,266
continents?


784
0:30:45,266 --> 0:30:46,534
CHILDRESS: Throughout the


785
0:30:46,534 --> 0:30:48,536
19th century, many giant


786
0:30:48,536 --> 0:30:50,38
skeletons were allegedly


787
0:30:50,38 --> 0:30:52,44
discovered in the Midwest, also


788
0:30:52,44 --> 0:30:54,576
in parts of California and


789
0:30:54,576 --> 0:30:56,77
around Death Valley.


790
0:30:56,77 --> 0:30:58,913
And the skeletons here, found at


791
0:30:58,913 --> 0:31:1,382
Lovelock, are one of the few


792
0:31:1,382 --> 0:31:3,918
that were really excavated by


793
0:31:3,918 --> 0:31:6,588
an accredited university.


794
0:31:6,588 --> 0:31:7,755
NARRATOR: Archaeologists from


795
0:31:7,755 --> 0:31:9,424
the Nevada Historical Society


796
0:31:9,424 --> 0:31:10,692
and the University of


797
0:31:10,692 --> 0:31:13,94
California believe the cave was


798
0:31:13,94 --> 0:31:14,929
occupied from approximately


799
0:31:14,929 --> 0:31:17,632
1500 BC until a few hundred


800
0:31:17,632 --> 0:31:19,934
years before white men appeared


801
0:31:19,934 --> 0:31:23,638
in the Nevada territory.


802
0:31:23,638 --> 0:31:26,674
75 miles from the cave site,


803
0:31:26,674 --> 0:31:28,843
a local museum has preserved


804
0:31:28,843 --> 0:31:30,511
several skulls that some


805
0:31:30,511 --> 0:31:32,48
believe are recovered remains


806
0:31:32,48 --> 0:31:35,516
of the giants.


807
0:31:35,516 --> 0:31:37,418
CHILDRESS: Inside this


808
0:31:37,418 --> 0:31:40,555
cabinet here, are three skulls


809
0:31:40,555 --> 0:31:43,558
from the Lovelock caves.


810
0:31:43,558 --> 0:31:46,694
When you first see these skulls,


811
0:31:46,694 --> 0:31:49,53
they seem to be pretty much


812
0:31:49,53 --> 0:31:52,533
normal-looking skulls.


813
0:31:52,533 --> 0:31:55,703
However, it's when we really


814
0:31:55,703 --> 0:31:59,173
start to compare the jawbones


815
0:31:59,173 --> 0:32:2,21
with this modern dental


816
0:32:2,21 --> 0:32:5,213
impression of a normal adult


817
0:32:5,213 --> 0:32:8,883
male, that we see that these


818
0:32:8,883 --> 0:32:12,2
jawbones are unusually large.


819
0:32:12,2 --> 0:32:14,656
And these are, really, the


820
0:32:14,656 --> 0:32:18,59
skulls of giant people who were


821
0:32:18,59 --> 0:32:20,228
perhaps seven, even eight feet


822
0:32:20,228 --> 0:32:22,23
tall.


823
0:32:22,23 --> 0:32:24,933
One of the odd things with these


824
0:32:24,933 --> 0:32:27,201
skulls is that they're not


825
0:32:27,201 --> 0:32:29,237
actually put on display here at


826
0:32:29,237 --> 0:32:29,904
the museum.


827
0:32:29,904 --> 0:32:31,205
And they're kept hidden in this


828
0:32:31,205 --> 0:32:33,207
cabinet.


829
0:32:33,207 --> 0:32:34,575
Now, we don't know if that's


830
0:32:34,575 --> 0:32:36,77
really, uh, just out of, um,


831
0:32:36,77 --> 0:32:38,947
respect for, uh, Native


832
0:32:38,947 --> 0:32:40,715
Americans, or whether there's


833
0:32:40,715 --> 0:32:42,83
really something unusual about


834
0:32:42,83 --> 0:32:44,252
these giant skulls that they


835
0:32:44,252 --> 0:32:46,921
don't want them to display.


836
0:32:46,921 --> 0:32:48,89
NARRATOR: Are the Nevada


837
0:32:48,89 --> 0:32:49,924
bones evidence of a race of


838
0:32:49,924 --> 0:32:51,559
giants that existed all through


839
0:32:51,559 --> 0:32:54,595
early human history?


840
0:32:54,595 --> 0:32:57,765
If so, could the giants be the


841
0:32:57,765 --> 0:32:58,9
descendants of


842
0:32:58,9 --> 0:33:0,768
extraterrestrials?


843
0:33:0,768 --> 0:33:2,57
According to the Hebrew


844
0:33:2,57 --> 0:33:4,906
Testament, one such giant


845
0:33:4,906 --> 0:33:7,241
appeared in the valley of Elah


846
0:33:7,241 --> 0:33:9,777
2,500 years ago.


847
0:33:9,777 --> 0:33:12,947
Each morning, for 40 days, a


848
0:33:12,947 --> 0:33:15,249
Philistine giant over nine feet


849
0:33:15,249 --> 0:33:16,985
tall challenged the Israelites


850
0:33:16,985 --> 0:33:20,121
to a fight.


851
0:33:20,121 --> 0:33:24,525
His name was Goliath.


852
0:33:24,525 --> 0:33:25,693
COPPENS: David and Goliath


853
0:33:25,693 --> 0:33:26,694
is one of those episodes


854
0:33:26,694 --> 0:33:28,529
in the Bible where you


855
0:33:28,529 --> 0:33:30,698
wonder what is going on.


856
0:33:30,698 --> 0:33:33,601
Is it t just a metaphor or are e


857
0:33:33,601 --> 0:33:35,69
dealing with a fundamental


858
0:33:35,69 --> 0:33:36,537
interpretation?


859
0:33:36,537 --> 0:33:38,239
And in that sense, Goliath has


860
0:33:38,239 --> 0:33:40,475
to be a giant creature.


861
0:33:40,475 --> 0:33:42,944
The question then is: "He cannot


862
0:33:42,944 --> 0:33:46,414
be human. What is he?"


863
0:33:46,414 --> 0:33:47,949
NARRATOR: David's stunning


864
0:33:47,949 --> 0:33:50,118
triumph over Goliath was


865
0:33:50,118 --> 0:33:52,453
considered a mere fable,


866
0:33:52,453 --> 0:33:53,921
until archaeologists turned up


867
0:33:53,921 --> 0:33:56,224
evidence that suggests this


868
0:33:56,224 --> 0:33:59,761
confrontation really did happen.


869
0:33:59,761 --> 0:34:1,763
On the outskirts of


870
0:34:1,763 --> 0:34:4,265
Tell Es-Safi, Israel, scientists


871
0:34:4,265 --> 0:34:5,767
discovered a moat that may have


872
0:34:5,767 --> 0:34:7,101
once protected the Philistine


873
0:34:7,101 --> 0:34:8,87
fortress.


874
0:34:8,87 --> 0:34:11,205
Nearby, they found shards of


875
0:34:11,205 --> 0:34:13,474
pottery inscribed with the name


876
0:34:13,474 --> 0:34:15,61
Goliath.


877
0:34:15,61 --> 0:34:18,479
Tests indicate the pottery is


878
0:34:18,479 --> 0:34:20,415
from the same time period as


879
0:34:20,415 --> 0:34:22,383
described in the Bible.


880
0:34:22,383 --> 0:34:24,786
Ancient astronaut theorists


881
0:34:24,786 --> 0:34:26,754
claim this is unmistakable


882
0:34:26,754 --> 0:34:29,123
evidence of extraterrestrial


883
0:34:29,123 --> 0:34:32,126
giants in biblical times.


884
0:34:32,126 --> 0:34:39,5
And they say there is much more.


885
0:34:39,5 --> 0:34:41,35
The most common megalithic


886
0:34:41,35 --> 0:34:42,67
construction known is the


887
0:34:42,67 --> 0:34:44,5
dolmen.


888
0:34:44,5 --> 0:34:45,706
Believed to be burial chambers,


889
0:34:45,706 --> 0:34:47,175
they are found throughout


890
0:34:47,175 --> 0:34:49,1
Europe, the Middle East, South


891
0:34:49,1 --> 0:34:51,212
America, and Asia.


892
0:34:51,212 --> 0:34:53,848
Could these mega structures be


893
0:34:53,848 --> 0:34:57,18
the ruins of giants?


894
0:34:57,18 --> 0:34:58,82
COPPENS: Archeology likes


895
0:34:58,82 --> 0:35:0,688
to use the word "dolmen," but


896
0:35:0,688 --> 0:35:1,989
they were formerly known in


897
0:35:1,989 --> 0:35:3,991
folklore as "giant's graves."


898
0:35:3,991 --> 0:35:5,493
FATHER William FULCO: A


899
0:35:5,493 --> 0:35:7,829
dolmen is shaped like the Greek


900
0:35:7,829 --> 0:35:9,664
letter "pi" with the top on it.


901
0:35:9,664 --> 0:35:10,932
And they're made of enormous


902
0:35:10,932 --> 0:35:13,501
blocks of limestone.


903
0:35:13,501 --> 0:35:15,703
And even today, it's...


904
0:35:15,703 --> 0:35:16,838
We are marveled that anyone


905
0:35:16,838 --> 0:35:18,5
could construct those things,


906
0:35:18,5 --> 0:35:19,841
and wonder how they got the top


907
0:35:19,841 --> 0:35:21,476
on top of the uprights.


908
0:35:21,476 --> 0:35:23,44
And those were built during the


909
0:35:23,44 --> 0:35:24,178
Middle Bronze Period, which is


910
0:35:24,178 --> 0:35:27,215
roughly 2000 to 1500 before the


911
0:35:27,215 --> 0:35:28,349
common era.


912
0:35:28,349 --> 0:35:29,817
So seeing things like that,


913
0:35:29,817 --> 0:35:31,185
people questioned, those


914
0:35:31,185 --> 0:35:32,186
must've been made by giants.


915
0:35:32,186 --> 0:35:33,521
I mean, ordinary people could


916
0:35:33,521 --> 0:35:34,722
not have done that.


917
0:35:34,722 --> 0:35:36,691
COPPENS: Are we dealing with


918
0:35:36,691 --> 0:35:38,25
metaphors or are we dealing


919
0:35:38,25 --> 0:35:40,194
with hard evidence?


920
0:35:40,194 --> 0:35:41,529
Are these physical creatures


921
0:35:41,529 --> 0:35:43,197
which somehow roamed the earth?


922
0:35:43,197 --> 0:35:45,466
And I think, on volume, we have


923
0:35:45,466 --> 0:35:47,535
to accept that some of these


924
0:35:47,535 --> 0:35:48,803
were real.


925
0:35:48,803 --> 0:35:50,638
The question, then, is how did


926
0:35:50,638 --> 0:35:53,641
these genetic freaks come about?


927
0:35:53,641 --> 0:35:55,476
TSOUKALOS: One of the main


928
0:35:55,476 --> 0:35:56,611
tenets of ancient astronaut


929
0:35:56,611 --> 0:35:58,446
theory suggests that a long


930
0:35:58,446 --> 0:36:0,815
time ago, extraterrestrials


931
0:36:0,815 --> 0:36:3,651
changed our genetic makeup


932
0:36:3,651 --> 0:36:6,32
through a targeted mutation of


933
0:36:6,32 --> 0:36:8,589
our genes, essentially in the


934
0:36:8,589 --> 0:36:10,625
lab.


935
0:36:10,625 --> 0:36:12,86
So they took a couple of human


936
0:36:12,86 --> 0:36:16,364
beings, altered their DNA, then


937
0:36:16,364 --> 0:36:19,0
reinserted those people back


938
0:36:19,0 --> 0:36:21,669
into the population, so through


939
0:36:21,669 --> 0:36:24,5
procreation, those people would


940
0:36:24,5 --> 0:36:25,673
pass on those new genetic


941
0:36:25,673 --> 0:36:27,675
alterations to the entire


942
0:36:27,675 --> 0:36:29,677
population.

theorists suggest the evidence


945
0:36:32,847 --> 0:36:35,16
points to one conclusion, that


946
0:36:35,16 --> 0:36:37,652
aliens changed the genetics of


947
0:36:37,652 --> 0:36:40,321
early human DNA.


948
0:36:40,321 --> 0:36:42,29
COPPENS: For an alien being


949
0:36:42,29 --> 0:36:45,293
to work with DNA is so easy


950
0:36:45,293 --> 0:36:47,628
that just creating a new type


951
0:36:47,628 --> 0:36:49,964
is not at all that difficult.


952
0:36:49,964 --> 0:36:51,632
Even today, we have the


953
0:36:51,632 --> 0:36:53,401
capability to create new types


954
0:36:53,401 --> 0:36:55,403
of animals.


955
0:36:55,403 --> 0:36:57,405
The question is, were we


956
0:36:57,405 --> 0:37:0,308
created as such, as well?


957
0:37:0,308 --> 0:37:1,642
NARRATOR: But what reason


958
0:37:1,642 --> 0:37:3,511
could extraterrestrial visitors


959
0:37:3,511 --> 0:37:5,146
have had for populating the


960
0:37:5,146 --> 0:37:6,814
Earth with mixed species and


961
0:37:6,814 --> 0:37:8,95
monstrous hybrids?


962
0:37:8,95 --> 0:37:10,985
Were they the result of some


963
0:37:10,985 --> 0:37:12,82
kind of scientific experiment


964
0:37:12,82 --> 0:37:17,191
gone terribly wrong?


965
0:37:17,191 --> 0:37:19,193
Did ancient aliens have some


966
0:37:19,193 --> 0:37:21,162
reason to experiment with human


967
0:37:21,162 --> 0:37:31,183
DNA?


968
0:37:31,183 --> 0:37:32,518
NARRATOR: The Galapagos


969
0:37:32,518 --> 0:37:34,319
Islands, off the coast of South


970
0:37:34,319 --> 0:37:36,355
America, are known for their


971
0:37:36,355 --> 0:37:40,259
unique biodiversity.


972
0:37:40,259 --> 0:37:42,995
In 1832, a naturalist named


973
0:37:42,995 --> 0:37:46,231
Charles Darwin came to these
islands to observe and record


974
0:37:46,231 --> 0:37:48,567
several species of animals not


975
0:37:48,567 --> 0:37:50,335
seen before.


976
0:37:50,335 --> 0:37:52,337
The result of his studies


977
0:37:52,337 --> 0:37:53,872
formed the basis for his


978
0:37:53,872 --> 0:37:56,8
controversial book, The Origin


979
0:37:56,8 --> 0:37:57,71
of Species.


980
0:37:57,71 --> 0:37:59,878
In it, Darwin proposed his


981
0:37:59,878 --> 0:38:1,547
theory of evolution, which


982
0:38:1,547 --> 0:38:3,649
held that all life evolved over


983
0:38:3,649 --> 0:38:5,35
time, through a process of


984
0:38:5,35 --> 0:38:7,986
natural selection.


985
0:38:7,986 --> 0:38:10,422
But even Darwin's theories


986
0:38:10,422 --> 0:38:11,89
could not explain the


987
0:38:11,89 --> 0:38:13,392
developmental gap between apes


988
0:38:13,392 --> 0:38:15,728
and man.


989
0:38:15,728 --> 0:38:18,731
There was, it was believed,


990
0:38:18,731 --> 0:38:20,599
a transitional species that had


991
0:38:20,599 --> 0:38:22,701
to exist, one which became


992
0:38:22,701 --> 0:38:24,369
referred to as, "the missing


993
0:38:24,369 --> 0:38:26,739
link."

0:38:29,141 --> 0:38:32,544
been around for 300,000 years.


996
0:38:32,544 --> 0:38:35,547
And only in a few thousand


997
0:38:35,547 --> 0:38:38,717
years, our brain size


998
0:38:38,717 --> 0:38:42,488
essentially tripled.


999
0:38:42,488 --> 0:38:45,424
Now, that does not jive with


1000
0:38:45,424 --> 0:38:46,892
ordinary evolution.


1001
0:38:46,892 --> 0:38:48,894
You need time.


1002
0:38:48,894 --> 0:38:51,697
A very long time.


1003
0:38:51,697 --> 0:38:54,399
However, today, biologists


1004
0:38:54,399 --> 0:38:57,202
cannot quite put a finger on


1005
0:38:57,202 --> 0:39:0,405
how our brain volume tripled in


1006
0:39:0,405 --> 0:39:3,575
a very short time period.


1007
0:39:3,575 --> 0:39:7,846
That is still a mystery.

jump-starting human evolution

unable to find the missing link,


1016
0:39:22,828 --> 0:39:24,496
and maybe that's simply because


1017
0:39:24,496 --> 0:39:26,131
Earth is unable to offer that


1018
0:39:26,131 --> 0:39:27,299
missing link.


1019
0:39:27,299 --> 0:39:28,5
Maybe the missing link is not


1020
0:39:28,5 --> 0:39:29,501
of this Earth.


1021
0:39:29,501 --> 0:39:30,669
Maybe the missing link is


1022
0:39:30,669 --> 0:39:32,504
somewhere outside,


1023
0:39:32,504 --> 0:39:35,307
extraterrestrial.

1025
0:39:38,477 --> 0:39:39,812
science took a giant step


1026
0:39:39,812 --> 0:39:41,78
forward when geneticists


1027
0:39:41,78 --> 0:39:43,782
successfully cloned a sheep.


1028
0:39:43,782 --> 0:39:46,785
This revolutionary technology


1029
0:39:46,785 --> 0:39:48,52
marked a significant


1030
0:39:48,52 --> 0:39:49,788

understanding of DNA.

0:39:55,194 --> 0:39:57,462
visitors have also possessed


1034
0:39:57,462 --> 0:40:1,333
knowledge of genetics?


1035
0:40:1,333 --> 0:40:3,135
>> MARTELL: In the Sumerian


1036
0:40:3,135 --> 0:40:5,3
records of mythology, they


1037
0:40:5,3 --> 0:40:6,171

1042
0:40:11,343 --> 0:40:13,378
genetically engineer us.


1043
0:40:13,378 --> 0:40:14,513
>> COPPENS: More and more


1044
0:40:14,513 --> 0:40:16,181
creatures are being discovered,


1045
0:40:16,181 --> 0:40:17,549
as s science goes along, in


1046
0:40:17,549 --> 0:40:18,75
little caves, or on little


1047
0:40:18,75 --> 0:40:21,86
islands, whereby DNA evidence


1048
0:40:21,86 --> 0:40:22,588
clearly shows that something


1049
0:40:22,588 --> 0:40:23,422
else has been happening.


1050
0:40:23,422 --> 0:40:24,423
We're probably gonna get to


1051
0:40:24,423 --> 0:40:26,525
hard scientific fact that


1052
0:40:26,525 --> 0:40:29,94
something interbred with humans,


1053
0:40:29,94 --> 0:40:30,762
on certain occasions, certain


1054
0:40:30,762 --> 0:40:34,6
moments in time.


1055
0:40:34,6 --> 0:40:35,934
>> NARRATOR: Could the giants


1056
0:40:35,934 --> 0:40:37,703
and monsters described in the


1057
0:40:37,703 --> 0:40:39,872
ancient myths be examples of


1058
0:40:39,872 --> 0:40:41,607
genetic mutations?


1059
0:40:41,607 --> 0:40:43,475
And if so, what purpose might


1060
0:40:43,475 --> 0:40:45,777
they have served?


1061
0:40:45,777 --> 0:40:47,312
>> CREMO: There are actually


1062
0:40:47,312 --> 0:40:49,114
accounts in the ancient


1063
0:40:49,114 --> 0:40:51,316
Sanskrit writings of India of


1064
0:40:51,316 --> 0:40:54,453
how, in their original attempts


1065
0:40:54,453 --> 0:40:57,623
to produce...


1066
0:40:57,623 --> 0:41:0,459
living things in the universe,


1067
0:41:0,459 --> 0:41:2,628
the gods, or the


1068
0:41:2,628 --> 0:41:4,763
extraterrestrial beings, made


1069
0:41:4,763 --> 0:41:8,467
mistakes and produced different


1070
0:41:8,467 --> 0:41:13,672
types of monsters and giants


1071
0:41:13,672 --> 0:41:16,642
and things like that.


1072
0:41:16,642 --> 0:41:18,677
>> Von D NIKEN: Why should the


1073
0:41:18,677 --> 0:41:21,13
so-called "gods" first make such


1074
0:41:21,13 --> 0:41:22,347
mixed creatures?


1075
0:41:22,347 --> 0:41:24,483
What's the purpose of it?


1076
0:41:24,483 --> 0:41:27,452
Did they observe a lion, and


1077
0:41:27,452 --> 0:41:30,88
they say to themself, "Why don't


1078
0:41:30,88 --> 0:41:32,391
we mix the strongness of the


1079
0:41:32,391 --> 0:41:35,394
muscle of the one animal with


1080
0:41:35,394 --> 0:41:39,398
the heat expellant, uh, skin of


1081
0:41:39,398 --> 0:41:41,934
the other animal, to use it at


1082
0:41:41,934 --> 0:41:43,769
some other planet, which is


1083
0:41:43,769 --> 0:41:44,703
different Earth?"


1084
0:41:44,703 --> 0:41:47,339
So they start to make breedings.


1085
0:41:47,339 --> 0:41:49,875
They start to make mixed


1086
0:41:49,875 --> 0:41:52,711
creatures.


1087
0:41:52,711 --> 0:41:54,413
>> NARRATOR: Scholars and


1088
0:41:54,413 --> 0:41:56,748
archaeologists generally agree


1089
0:41:56,748 --> 0:41:59,351
that sometime around 3000 BC,


1090
0:41:59,351 --> 0:42:1,353
during the Megalithic Era,


1091
0:42:1,353 --> 0:42:3,388
mankind took a quantum leap


1092
0:42:3,388 --> 0:42:4,89
forward with regard to


1093
0:42:4,89 --> 0:42:6,325
civilization and use of


1094
0:42:6,325 --> 0:42:7,793
technology.


1095
0:42:7,793 --> 0:42:9,861
According to myths and legends,


1096
0:42:9,861 --> 0:42:11,563
human beings gave credit to


1097
0:42:11,563 --> 0:42:12,898
their gods for giving them


1098
0:42:12,898 --> 0:42:14,566
this knowledge.


1099
0:42:14,566 --> 0:42:16,902
But if the gods were, in fact,


1100
0:42:16,902 --> 0:42:19,738
alien visitors, might mankind's


1101
0:42:19,738 --> 0:42:21,573
quantum leap forward have had a


1102
0:42:21,573 --> 0:42:24,343
more intergalactic origin?


1103
0:42:24,343 --> 0:42:26,78
>> COPPENS: It is clear that


1104
0:42:26,78 --> 0:42:27,913
something affected multiple


1105
0:42:27,913 --> 0:42:29,915
continents on this planet


1106
0:42:29,915 --> 0:42:31,65
around 3000 BC.


1107
0:42:31,65 --> 0:42:33,452
The pyramids began to be built


1108
0:42:33,452 --> 0:42:35,387
at that moment in time.


1109
0:42:35,387 --> 0:42:36,788
Why?


1110
0:42:36,788 --> 0:42:38,924
What was that imperative?


1111
0:42:38,924 --> 0:42:40,659
Was it a global imperative?


1112
0:42:40,659 --> 0:42:41,66
Yes.


1113
0:42:41,66 --> 0:42:43,161
Was it an imperative which came


1114
0:42:43,161 --> 0:42:44,463
from outside of this world?


1115
0:42:44,463 --> 0:42:45,664
Yes.


1116
0:42:45,664 --> 0:42:46,832
>> NARRATOR: If aliens


1117
0:42:46,832 --> 0:42:48,333
intervened to speed the


1118
0:42:48,333 --> 0:42:50,35
advancement of human beings, is


1119
0:42:50,35 --> 0:42:52,204
it also possible that they have


1120
0:42:52,204 --> 0:42:53,939
influenced mankind at other


1121
0:42:53,939 --> 0:42:56,174
critical junctures in history?


1122
0:42:56,174 --> 0:42:58,343
And, if so, could they have


1123
0:42:58,343 --> 0:43:0,345
continued to monitor us,


1124
0:43:0,345 --> 0:43:1,513
even today?


1125
0:43:1,513 --> 0:43:2,514
>> MARTELL: It's very possible


1126
0:43:2,514 --> 0:43:4,182
that, if there was some type of


1127
0:43:4,182 --> 0:43:5,183
genetic intervention,


1128
0:43:5,183 --> 0:43:6,685
by an extraterrestrial race,


1129
0:43:6,685 --> 0:43:8,487
on humanity, they would be very


1130
0:43:8,487 --> 0:43:10,188
interested to see their


1131
0:43:10,188 --> 0:43:14,26
experiment progress.


1132
0:43:14,26 --> 0:43:15,66
>> Von D NIKEN: I am often


1133
0:43:15,66 --> 0:43:17,829
asked the question, "Iit not


1134
0:43:17,829 --> 0:43:18,964
ridiculous to believe that


1135
0:43:18,964 --> 0:43:20,165
extraterrestrials should, in a


1136
0:43:20,165 --> 0:43:22,267
way or other, look similar to


1137
0:43:22,267 --> 0:43:24,2
us, or even think similar


1138
0:43:24,2 --> 0:43:25,3
to us?"


1139
0:43:25,3 --> 0:43:26,171
No.


1140
0:43:26,171 --> 0:43:27,506
The question is wrong.


1141
0:43:27,506 --> 0:43:29,207
They are not, by coincidence,


1142
0:43:29,207 --> 0:43:31,9
similar to us, but we are


1143
0:43:31,9 --> 0:43:33,845
similar to them, because we are


1144
0:43:33,845 --> 0:43:36,281
the product.


1145
0:43:36,281 --> 0:43:38,15
>> NARRATOR: But if alien


1146
0:43:38,15 --> 0:43:39,851
beings did interbreed with


1147
0:43:39,851 --> 0:43:41,853
humans, why?


1148
0:43:41,853 --> 0:43:43,655
Was it to save their own


1149
0:43:43,655 --> 0:43:45,57
species?


1150
0:43:45,57 --> 0:43:46,992
Or, perhaps, hide the genetic


1151

traces of their presence here


1152
0:43:48,293 --> 0:43:48,86
on Earth?


1153
0:43:48,86 --> 0:43:52,341
Could there even be aliens


1154
0:43:52,341 --> 0:43:55,196
living among us?
