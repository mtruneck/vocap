been watching HBO


7
0:0:38,35 --> 0:0:40,8
You got a new favourite show


8
0:0:40,8 --> 0:0:47,35
It's called Game of Thrones


9
0:0:47,35 --> 0:0:53,35
Well, I read the fucking books!


10
0:0:53,35 --> 0:1:1,0
I said, I read the fucking books!


11
0:1:1,0 --> 0:1:4,21
I read them years ago


12
0:1:4,21 --> 0:1:8,2
so don't tell me bout Jon Snow


13
0:1:8,2 --> 0:1:9,42
Cause I already know


14
0:1:9,42 --> 0:1:12,42
I've got a signed copy of "A Feast for Crows"


15
0:1:12,42 --> 0:1:15,369
Then a six year wait for "A Dance With Dragons".


16
0:1:15,369 --> 0:1:18,369
A six year wait for "A Dance With Dragons".


17
0:1:18,369 --> 0:1:21,369
I waited six fucking years for "A Dance With Dragons"


18
0:1:21,369 --> 0:1:28,369
and now you jump on the fucking bandwagon


19
0:1:28,369 --> 0:1:33,369

20
0:1:33,369 --> 0:1:35,569
I said I read the fucking books twice


21
0:1:35,569 --> 0:1:38,25
Don't talk to me about spoilers


22
0:1:38,25 --> 0:1:44,25
Winter has been coming for sixteen, fucking years


23
0:1:44,25 --> 0:1:50,25
You motherfuckers!


24
0:1:50,25 --> 0:1:56,14
His name is Joffrey not Geoffrey!


25
0:1:56,14 --> 0:2:1,18
Get a fucking library card!


26
0:2:1,18 --> 0:2:4,8
Or a Kindle!


27
0:2:4,8 --> 0:2:6,1
What's wrong with you people


28
0:2:6,1 --> 0:2:7,1
no one reads anymore


29
0:2:7,1 --> 0:2:9,8
Your imagination is a fun place to explore


30
0:2:9,8 --> 0:2:13,1
Go to a library or a fucking book store


31
0:2:13,1 --> 0:2:16,1
take it from me, you'll enjoy the book more


32
0:2:16,1 --> 0:2:19,1
"Harry Potter", the book was better


33
0:2:19,1 --> 0:2:21,9
"The Hunger Games", the book was better


34
0:2:21,9 --> 0:2:24,1
"The Lord of the Rings", the books were probably better


35
0:2:24,1 --> 0:2:30,9
"The Cat in the Hat", the book was better


36
0:2:30,9 --> 0:2:32,1
and whilst I'm on the topic


37
0:2:32,1 --> 0:2:35,1
what the fuck is with movies based on board games


38
0:2:35,1 --> 0:2:36,7
Battleship: The Movie


39
0:2:36,7 --> 0:2:38,1
D-9, I sunk your battleship


40
0:2:38,1 --> 0:2:42,1
Movie over. Fuck off!


41
0:2:42,1 --> 0:2:45,2
Hollywood cannot live up to the power of imagination


42
0:2:45,2 --> 0:2:47,9
Hollywood cannot live up to the power of imagination


43
0:2:47,9 --> 0:2:50,9

44
