0:0:1,25 --> 0:0:26,7
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all very much. I
like to tell people part of my job is to be


2
0:0:26,7 --> 0:0:34,23
the educator-in-chief. And today we're at
a really interesting facility in North Carolina


3
0:0:34,23 --> 0:0:44,59
to talk about what's possible; what dreamers
are doing to enable us to achieve a very important


4
0:0:44,59 --> 0:0:52,23
national goal, and that is to become less
dependent on oil from overseas, thereby ensuring


5
0:0:52,23 --> 0:0:58,9
that our national security interests are better
intact and our economic security interests


6
0:0:58,9 --> 0:1:1,329
are better intact and that we're better stewards
of the environment. That's what we're here


7
0:1:1,329 --> 0:1:1,949
to talk about.


8
0:1:1,949 --> 0:1:12,51
But before I do, I do want to thank some people.
First, Laura sends her regrets. I'm a lucky


9
0:1:12,51 --> 0:1:17,36
boy to have her -- (laughter) -- to have her
as my wife. We've got a lot of friends here


10
0:1:17,36 --> 0:1:24,86
in Carolina, and she sends her best wishes
to our Carolina friends. I told some folks


11
0:1:24,86 --> 0:1:28,299
yesterday, I'm not very objective when it
comes to my wife, but I think the country


12
0:1:28,299 --> 0:1:41,11
is really lucky to have her as the First Lady.
(Applause.)


13
0:1:41,11 --> 0:1:45,11
We're here at Novozymes, which is a company
that makes enzymes. We're going to talk to


14
0:1:45,11 --> 0:1:51,22
Thomas, who is the President and Plant Manager,
about what they do here, and why it's relevant.


15
0:1:51,22 --> 0:1:55,47
Before we get there, I do want to say something
about Steen Riisgaard. He's the President


16
0:1:55,47 --> 0:2:1,6
and CEO, Steen. He flew over from Denmark.
I can't thank you enough for coming. I appreciate


17
0:2:1,6 --> 0:2:8,6
you being here. It's interesting, isn't it,
when you're able to sit in North Carolina


18
0:2:8,6 --> 0:2:16,29
and talk about a Danish company that is investing
to not only help us become less dependent


19
0:2:16,29 --> 0:2:22,0
on oil, but equally importantly is investing
capital, which enables citizens from the United


20
0:2:22,0 --> 0:2:24,0
States to find good work.


21
0:2:24,0 --> 0:2:32,28
I toured around the facility, and I asked
people at the facility how long they had been


22
0:2:32,28 --> 0:2:37,41
working here. And a lot of people have been
here 20-plus years. So for those people who


23
0:2:37,41 --> 0:2:42,87
are worried about free trade, I want you to
remember that if this country were to wall


24
0:2:42,87 --> 0:2:48,819
ourselves off from the world, we would miss
opportunities to find markets for our products,


25
0:2:48,819 --> 0:2:53,99
and at the same time miss opportunities for
citizens who work at a facility like this


26
0:2:53,99 --> 0:2:58,489
to find good work. It's in our interests that
we have free and fair trade.


27
0:2:58,489 --> 0:3:3,22
And so I thank you very much, Steen, for investing
in the United States of America, and I appreciate


28
0:3:3,22 --> 0:3:7,4
the fact that you're sensitive to the needs
of the workers here in the United States of


29
0:3:7,4 --> 0:3:9,97
America. And I see you're sitting next to
your Ambassador. Mr. Ambassador, welcome.


30
0:3:9,97 --> 0:3:17,22
I'm glad you're here. (Applause.)


31
0:3:17,22 --> 0:3:26,4
A person who understands the vast potential
in the lands here in North Carolina to make


32
0:3:26,4 --> 0:3:29,81
us less dependent on oil is Richard Burr.
He's the United States Senator. I'm proud


33
0:3:29,81 --> 0:3:34,72
he's joined us today, and thank you for coming,
Senator. There you go. (Applause.) Congressman


34
0:3:34,72 --> 0:3:40,23
G.K. Butterfield. Thank you for being here,
G.K. Appreciate you coming. (Applause.) He's


35
0:3:40,23 --> 0:3:51,299
a United States Congressman from the neighboring
district, but he has enough interest in making


36
0:3:51,299 --> 0:3:57,659
sure that we succeed in alternative sources
of energy, that he's here. He's also on an


37
0:3:57,659 --> 0:4:2,34
important subcommittee in the House. I appreciate
your interest. Appreciate you joining us.


38
0:4:2,34 --> 0:4:6,709
I want to thank the Agricultural Commissioner
from the great state of North Carolina, Steve


39
0:4:6,709 --> 0:4:13,1
Troxler, who's joined us today. Steve, thank
you for coming. There he is, right there.


40
0:4:13,1 --> 0:4:20,609
(Applause.) See, Steve needs to take an interest
in this like he is, because doesn't it make


41
0:4:20,609 --> 0:4:26,43
sense to be able to say to our farmers, grow
what you can grow so we become less dependent


42
0:4:26,43 --> 0:4:33,81
on oil. I like the idea of a President being
able to say, wow, the crop report is in, we're


43
0:4:33,81 --> 0:4:39,78
growing more corn than ever before, which
means we're importing less oil from overseas.


44
0:4:39,78 --> 0:4:48,87
It's an exciting time to think about that
our farmers not only are going to grow what


45
0:4:48,87 --> 0:4:50,65
we need to eat, but it's going to grow what
we need to run our automobiles.


46
0:4:50,65 --> 0:4:53,25
And that's coming. That's what we're here
to discuss today. I know it sounds like a


47
0:4:53,25 --> 0:4:59,91
pipe dream to some -- you know, there goes
the optimistic President talking again. But


48
0:4:59,91 --> 0:5:8,15
you're going to hear from some experts here.
I'm just a history major. (Laughter.) And


49
0:5:8,15 --> 0:5:19,8
I'm with Ph.D.s. (Laughter.) Let me remind
you who the President is. (Laughter and applause.)


50
0:5:19,8 --> 0:5:28,59
But the Ph.D.s are providing the brain power
necessary to help plants like this develop


51
0:5:28,59 --> 0:5:38,12
technologies that will enable us to convert
wood chips into fuels that are running automobiles.


52
0:5:38,12 --> 0:5:44,139
It's an interesting time, isn't it, when you're
able to say, we're on the verge of some breakthroughs


53
0:5:44,139 --> 0:5:49,44
that will enable a pile of wood chips to become
the raw materials for fuels that will run


54
0:5:49,44 --> 0:5:50,25
your car.


55
0:5:50,25 --> 0:5:55,199
I appreciate the Mayor, Jenny Edwards, here,
Mayor of Franklinton, for joining us. Where


56
0:5:55,199 --> 0:5:58,16
are you, Madam Mayor? Thanks for coming. Proud
to see you again. (Applause.) And all the


57
0:5:58,16 --> 0:6:9,22
Novozymes employees, I appreciate you setting
this deal up and I appreciate you putting


58
0:6:9,22 --> 0:6:15,18
up with the hundreds who travel with me. (Laughter.)
And thank you for your warm hospitality.


59
0:6:15,18 --> 0:6:20,18
Look, here's -- I just told you the goal.
The goal is for the United States to be -- to


60
0:6:20,18 --> 0:6:28,21
diversify away from old, old ways. And it's
possible. And I do believe it is a proper


61
0:6:28,21 --> 0:6:36,289
use of your money, taxpayers' money, to spend
to encourage research on interesting ideas.


62
0:6:36,289 --> 0:6:44,21
We spent about $12 billion since I've been
your President to try to stimulate technologies


63
0:6:44,21 --> 0:6:49,94
that will literally change the way we live.
A lot of that money has gone into clean coal


64
0:6:49,94 --> 0:6:55,729
technologies. If you're worried about dependency
on oil from overseas, then it seems to make


65
0:6:55,729 --> 0:7:0,66
sense to me that we ought to be able to have
the technology so that we can better use the


66
0:7:0,66 --> 0:7:2,41
resources we have here at home.


67
0:7:2,41 --> 0:7:8,4
I don't know if you know this, we've got about
250 years worth of coal in America. That's


68
0:7:8,4 --> 0:7:15,229
what they estimate. And it makes sense, therefore,
to spend money at the federal level to develop


69
0:7:15,229 --> 0:7:21,39
technologies so we can burn that coal in environmentally
friendly ways. The idea is to have zero emission


70
0:7:21,39 --> 0:7:25,77
coal-fired plants here in America. And it's
possible, and we're making progress toward


71
0:7:25,77 --> 0:7:26,539
that goal.


72
0:7:26,539 --> 0:7:30,49
I happen to believe that if you're concerned
about the environment and want to deal with


73
0:7:30,49 --> 0:7:38,759
renewable sources of energy, that we need
to pursue nuclear power. Those power plants


74
0:7:38,759 --> 0:7:46,66
emit zero greenhouse gases. It doesn't require
any hydrocarbons from overseas to run those


75
0:7:46,66 --> 0:7:53,949
plants. So we're beginning to license new
plants. We're spending money on wind and solar


76
0:7:53,949 --> 0:8:1,55
energies. It makes sense to be able to -- as
the price of hydrocarbons goes up, it makes


77
0:8:1,55 --> 0:8:5,68
sense that there be alternative sources of
energy coming to the market as quickly as


78
0:8:5,68 --> 0:8:6,19
possible.


79
0:8:6,19 --> 0:8:10,75
So we're making pretty good progress. But
if you really want to reduce the amount of


80
0:8:10,75 --> 0:8:16,569
oil that you consume, you got to reduce the
amount of gasoline you use. In other words,


81
0:8:16,569 --> 0:8:22,849
if you say, we want to reduce our dependence
on oil, what you really got to do is change


82
0:8:22,849 --> 0:8:28,2
gasoline usage in the United States. And there's
a couple of exciting things that are taking


83
0:8:28,2 --> 0:8:33,39
place -- one is new battery technologies.
We're spending money at the federal level


84
0:8:33,39 --> 0:8:37,289
-- and by the way, there's a lot of private
sector money going into alternative sources


85
0:8:37,289 --> 0:8:41,43
of energy. And some day you're going to be
able to get in your car, particularly if you're


86
0:8:41,43 --> 0:8:50,89
a big-city person, and drive 40 miles on a
battery. It's coming. And by the way, the


87
0:8:50,89 --> 0:8:58,32
car doesn't have to look like a golf cart.
(Laughter.) It could be a pickup truck. (Laughter.)


88
0:8:58,32 --> 0:9:4,149
And that technology is around the corner.
And if we're able to drive the first 40 miles,


89
0:9:4,149 --> 0:9:8,38
or, say, 20 miles, on gasoline [sic] there's
a lot of big-city folks that will never have


90
0:9:8,38 --> 0:9:15,16
to use a drop of gasoline on a daily basis.
They'll be driving via electricity. These


91
0:9:15,16 --> 0:9:19,66
are lithium-ion batteries, technology -- so
when you hear that term, you just got to know


92
0:9:19,66 --> 0:9:24,5
there's a lot of folks and a lot of money
aiming hard to get this to the market as quickly


93
0:9:24,5 --> 0:9:29,23
as possible. Why? Because we've set a goal
for the United States to be less dependent


94
0:9:29,23 --> 0:9:29,769
on oil.


95
0:9:29,769 --> 0:9:37,519
Secondly -- and this is what we're here to
talk about today -- is ethanol. It says that


96
0:9:37,519 --> 0:9:45,74
the new developments in ethanol -- in other
words, fuel derived from corn -- can be diversified.


97
0:9:45,74 --> 0:9:52,41
Here's the problem: Right now we're consuming
about 7 billion gallons of ethanol a year


98
0:9:52,41 --> 0:9:58,1
made from corn. And it's a pretty standard
process. People here at this facility have


99
0:9:58,1 --> 0:10:1,63
developed the enzymes necessary to break the
corn down in an efficient way so that we can


100
0:10:1,63 --> 0:10:5,329
use ethanol derived from corn.


101
0:10:5,329 --> 0:10:11,829
The problem is we got a lot of hog growers
around the United States and a lot of them


102
0:10:11,829 --> 0:10:16,779
here in North Carolina who are beginning to
feel the pinch as a result of high corn prices.


103
0:10:16,779 --> 0:10:22,47
A lot of the cattle people around the United
States -- I have got a few of them in my home


104
0:10:22,47 --> 0:10:29,97
state of Texas -- they're worried about high
corn prices affecting their making a livelihood.


105
0:10:29,97 --> 0:10:37,43
In other words, the demand for corn, because
of agricultural use, and now energy use, is


106
0:10:37,43 --> 0:10:43,38
causing corn prices to go up. I bet you the
Agriculture Commissioner is hearing from folks.


107
0:10:43,38 --> 0:10:48,329
And so how do -- the question then is, how
do you achieve your goal of less dependence


108
0:10:48,329 --> 0:10:55,17
on oil without breaking your farmers -- without
breaking your hog raisers -- corn farmers


109
0:10:55,17 --> 0:11:0,89
happen to like it, but I'm talking about the
-- (laughter) -- people dependent on corn.


110
0:11:0,89 --> 0:11:6,51
And here's how: You develop new technologies
that will enable you to make ethanol from


111
0:11:6,51 --> 0:11:13,92
wood chips, or stalk grass, or agricultural
waste. And that's what we're here to talk


112
0:11:13,92 --> 0:11:20,91
about: Is it possible, and if it is possible,
how close are we to achieving the technological


113
0:11:20,91 --> 0:11:27,86
breakthroughs that I believe are possible
so that our -- so that we're changing our


114
0:11:27,86 --> 0:11:29,209
habits.


115
0:11:29,209 --> 0:11:32,49
And these are exciting times, they really
are. I've always said, America needs to stay


116
0:11:32,49 --> 0:11:39,73
on the leading edge of technological change.
It will mean we remain a really important


117
0:11:39,73 --> 0:11:45,269
economy in the world, but it will also mean
that our folks will be able to find good high-paying


118
0:11:45,269 --> 0:11:45,81
jobs.


119
0:11:45,81 --> 0:11:49,74
In this case, being on the leading edge of
technological change means that we'll also


120
0:11:49,74 --> 0:11:56,66
be able to deal simultaneous with economic
insecurities that come when China demands


121
0:11:56,66 --> 0:12:0,85
more for oil, the world produces less, the
price of oil goes up, and so does the price


122
0:12:0,85 --> 0:12:6,81
of gas at the pump here in North Carolina;
national security concerns where some people


123
0:12:6,81 --> 0:12:13,93
who've got oil don't like us, and therefore,
may be willing to use their energy resources


124
0:12:13,93 --> 0:12:22,18
to try to cause America to take a different
view of the world; and environmental concerns.


125
0:12:22,18 --> 0:12:30,98
And all these three concerns come together
with technology as the solution.


126
0:12:30,98 --> 0:12:35,67
And so Thomas, tell people what you do. (Laughter
and applause.)


127
0:12:35,67 --> 0:12:48,0
MR. NAGY: That was a -- that was a nice introduction.
Thank you, Mr. President. You may know, and


128
0:12:48,0 --> 0:12:54,279
many of you here -- first of all, I want to
welcome you very, very deep from my heart


129
0:12:54,279 --> 0:12:58,839
and from all my colleagues here in Franklinton,
welcome to North Carolina, welcome to Novozymes,


130
0:12:58,839 --> 0:13:8,22
and also welcome to the guests here. (Applause.)


131
0:13:8,22 --> 0:13:12,73
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. Like you're
the President, right?


132
0:13:12,73 --> 0:13:15,45
MR. NAGY: Well, you're the President. (Laughter.)
Okay, anyways --


133
0:13:15,45 --> 0:13:20,13
THE PRESIDENT: It didn't take him long to
learn, you know. (Laughter.)


134
0:13:20,13 --> 0:13:25,68
MR. NAGY: Novozymes is the world's leading
biotechnology company within the field of


135
0:13:25,68 --> 0:13:30,829
industrial enzymes and microorganisms. We
market more than 600 products around the globe,


136
0:13:30,829 --> 0:13:34,24
and all of these products have the same in
common, that they -- sort of like it's good


137
0:13:34,24 --> 0:13:39,56
for environment, it's good for businesses,
because when using our products, you use less


138
0:13:39,56 --> 0:13:42,699
resources, less energy, less water, and hence,
you make better use --


139
0:13:42,699 --> 0:13:43,49
THE PRESIDENT: So you make enzymes.


140
0:13:43,49 --> 0:13:49,22
MR. NAGY: We make enzymes. And enzymes is
sort of like the key component you need to


141
0:13:49,22 --> 0:13:54,93
have when you convert starch or the corn to
sugar that you can then make to alcohol or


142
0:13:54,93 --> 0:14:3,81
the ethanol. But also, it's got to be the
key component when you want to make your switchgrass


143
0:14:3,81 --> 0:14:7,57
or your biomass to sugar and then to ethanol.


144
0:14:7,57 --> 0:14:13,209
THE PRESIDENT: So the enzyme begins to break
down the raw materials in a particular raw


145
0:14:13,209 --> 0:14:16,23
material that will enable us to make more
ethanol, is that what you're saying?


146
0:14:16,23 --> 0:14:17,29
MR. NAGY: That is correct.


147
0:14:17,29 --> 0:14:21,62
THE PRESIDENT: Now -- so, is this a -- is
this like a huge distillery?


148
0:14:21,62 --> 0:14:23,24
MR. NAGY: Our plant here?


149
0:14:23,24 --> 0:14:24,209
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.


150
0:14:24,209 --> 0:14:28,91
MR. NAGY: Well, you could say what we do here,
we use microorganisms, and the way we make


151
0:14:28,91 --> 0:14:35,339
these enzymes is by the use of these microorganisms.
And you could compare our process to if you


152
0:14:35,339 --> 0:14:41,3
brew beer or wine. We take some agriculture
raw materials like starch, again, or corn,


153
0:14:41,3 --> 0:14:47,86
and then we ferment the insides, basically,
like you would ferment wine. The product here


154
0:14:47,86 --> 0:14:54,36
is the enzymes that we can then ship off to
ethanol plants around in the U.S. And they


155
0:14:54,36 --> 0:14:59,97
use it today to break down the starch in corn
and make ethanol. So we are a key provider


156
0:14:59,97 --> 0:15:3,89
of a key technology to make this happen for
you.


157
0:15:3,89 --> 0:15:9,37
THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely. And I presume that
one of the bottlenecks to achieving widespread


158
0:15:9,37 --> 0:15:15,269
ethanol production is the cost of enzymes.
Have you seen any appreciable decline in the


159
0:15:15,269 --> 0:15:18,61
cost of enzymes since you have been --


160
0:15:18,61 --> 0:15:24,61
MR. NAGY: Certainly. We have worked with enzymes
for many, many years at Novozymes. We have


161
0:15:24,61 --> 0:15:29,38
a 60-year tradition of this, and so we are
very, very good at it. We are the leading


162
0:15:29,38 --> 0:15:35,38
edge on all the technologies in all the markets
we are, and therefore we are a company dedicated


163
0:15:35,38 --> 0:15:41,449
to innovation, because innovation, as you
talk about, being able to compete with others,


164
0:15:41,449 --> 0:15:46,459
innovation is our tool to do so. And so we
reinvest more than 10 percent -- actually


165
0:15:46,459 --> 0:15:50,97
13 percent of our annual sales back into R&D.


166
0:15:50,97 --> 0:15:57,86
The research we do in cellulosic ethanol right
now is the biggest research of what we have


167
0:15:57,86 --> 0:16:2,12
in the company, where more than a hundred
researchers around the globe work on solving


168
0:16:2,12 --> 0:16:7,889
the issues ahead of us. What we have been
able to do since 2000 until we reported it


169
0:16:7,889 --> 0:16:15,6
in 2005, on a grant provided to us from Department
of Energy, is to reduce the cost of conversion


170
0:16:15,6 --> 0:16:16,949
by a factor of 30.


171
0:16:16,949 --> 0:16:22,41
THE PRESIDENT: I want to repeat, because you
actually -- he's talking about your money.


172
0:16:22,41 --> 0:16:27,55
(Laughter.) And he said that we gave a grant
-- we, the taxpayers of the United States,


173
0:16:27,55 --> 0:16:32,4
gave a grant to the researchers of this company,
see if they could not reduce the cost of producing


174
0:16:32,4 --> 0:16:36,889
the enzymes that would be critical to making
ethanol, and this company was able to do so


175
0:16:36,889 --> 0:16:42,639
-- reduced the cost by a factor of 30, which
I think is a justifiable use of taxpayer's


176
0:16:42,639 --> 0:16:44,44
money to see those kinds of results.


177
0:16:44,44 --> 0:16:45,69
MR. NAGY: Thank you.


178
0:16:45,69 --> 0:16:48,4
THE PRESIDENT: You got a lot of Ph.D.s and
advanced degrees here?


179
0:16:48,4 --> 0:16:49,92
MR. NAGY: Yes, we do. (Laughter.) We have
a few, yes.


180
0:16:49,92 --> 0:16:50,54
THE PRESIDENT: You do?


181
0:16:50,54 --> 0:16:51,329
MR. NAGY: Yes, we do.


182
0:16:51,329 --> 0:16:56,6
THE PRESIDENT: The reason I mention that is
that part of remaining a competitive society


183
0:16:56,6 --> 0:17:3,8
is to make sure our children get a good education
early, so that it is possible to get advanced


184
0:17:3,8 --> 0:17:14,799
degrees -- at least a degree beyond high school.
If you want a good job in America, you better


185
0:17:14,799 --> 0:17:19,77
go on after high school. The jobs in places
like this are jobs that require brain power,


186
0:17:19,77 --> 0:17:24,98
as much as anything else. And, therefore,
the educational system of this state, for


187
0:17:24,98 --> 0:17:29,87
example, has been critical in attracting industries
such as the company we're talking about here.


188
0:17:29,87 --> 0:17:33,39
I mean, I go walking through the halls and
shaking hands with people -- we got people


189
0:17:33,39 --> 0:17:38,89
on -- doing sophisticated computer programming;
we got lab technicians who have got advanced


190
0:17:38,89 --> 0:17:45,7
degrees in bioengineering. And my only point
is it reminds me of how important higher education


191
0:17:45,7 --> 0:17:52,62
is for this country. And I applaud the folks
of North Carolina about being on the leading


192
0:17:52,62 --> 0:17:57,7
edge of education, and that's why you got
companies like here, like this company here,


193
0:17:57,7 --> 0:17:59,539
paying pretty good money for jobs, I guess.


194
0:17:59,539 --> 0:18:2,659
MR. NAGY: That's correct. One of the reasons,
and what we really enjoy here is also the


195
0:18:2,659 --> 0:18:9,41
-- you alluded to the education system here,
but it's an integrated system from community


196
0:18:9,41 --> 0:18:15,41
colleges through all the levels at university.
And there's a number of universities in the


197
0:18:15,41 --> 0:18:20,47
state that we also enjoy very close collaboration
amongst. Some of them are NC State University,


198
0:18:20,47 --> 0:18:21,23
of course.


199
0:18:21,23 --> 0:18:28,429
THE PRESIDENT: Good. Well, Thomas, thanks,
buddy. I appreciate it. You handled it well.


200
0:18:28,429 --> 0:18:29,74
(Laughter.)


201
0:18:29,74 --> 0:18:33,66
Kevin Wenger. Yes, Kevin, how are you? What
do you do?


202
0:18:33,66 --> 0:18:39,28
DR. WENGER: I'm the manager of the R&D group
that we have here in North Carolina for ethanol


203
0:18:39,28 --> 0:18:39,66
research.


204
0:18:39,66 --> 0:18:41,14
THE PRESIDENT: For this company.


205
0:18:41,14 --> 0:18:48,15
DR. WENGER: For this company, yes. We, about
five years ago, decided to invest in a dedicated


206
0:18:48,15 --> 0:18:54,77
R&D group for ethanol process development,
and we decided to anchor that research group


207
0:18:54,77 --> 0:19:0,919
here in North Carolina, because the U.S. is
really where the ethanol market has been very


208
0:19:0,919 --> 0:19:1,19
strong.


209
0:19:1,19 --> 0:19:3,22
THE PRESIDENT: And you've got a degree in
what?


210
0:19:3,22 --> 0:19:9,7
DR. WENGER: I have a degree in chemical engineering,
Ph.D. from Colorado State University.


211
0:19:9,7 --> 0:19:9,57
THE PRESIDENT: Good.


212
0:19:9,57 --> 0:19:15,52
DR. WENGER: And I've been here in Novozymes
since I finished graduate school in 1994.


213
0:19:15,52 --> 0:19:21,89
THE PRESIDENT: And so in 1994, were you thinking
switchgrass into -- (laughter.)


214
0:19:21,89 --> 0:19:30,34
DR. WENGER: I've always been interested in
alternative energy and making ethanol. There


215
0:19:30,34 --> 0:19:34,3
wasn't so many jobs related to switchgrass
in 1994. (Laughter.)


216
0:19:34,3 --> 0:19:36,2
THE PRESIDENT: Well, cellulosic.


217
0:19:36,2 --> 0:19:40,47
DR. WENGER: Yes. But I was always -- I've
always been interested in fermentation also,


218
0:19:40,47 --> 0:19:44,539
and so Novozymes is a fermentation company
and that's how I ended up here.


219
0:19:44,539 --> 0:19:49,41
THE PRESIDENT: Interesting. And so I'd like
to quote what he said. Kevin said, "It's going


220
0:19:49,41 --> 0:19:52,58
to be a challenge," -- talking about achieving
what we're talking about here -- "but if we


221
0:19:52,58 --> 0:19:59,12
look at how far we've come in the past five
years, we have so much momentum, it shouldn't


222
0:19:59,12 --> 0:20:1,25
be that tough."


223
0:20:1,25 --> 0:20:5,77
And the reason I quote a person who knows
what he's talking about when it comes to developments


224
0:20:5,77 --> 0:20:14,46
necessary to bring the cellulosic ethanol
to market, I quote him because I presume in


225
0:20:14,46 --> 0:20:15,95
that optimism there's realism.


226
0:20:15,95 --> 0:20:22,77
DR. WENGER: Yes, I'm very optimistic, but
also I can see how the 20-in-10 goal is very


227
0:20:22,77 --> 0:20:27,98
achievable. If you look at what's happening
now, what's been happening with corn ethanol


228
0:20:27,98 --> 0:20:32,64
over the last five years and the developments
that are coming in terms of implementation


229
0:20:32,64 --> 0:20:36,58
of cellulosic, it's really amazing. Things
are really starting to happen.


230
0:20:36,58 --> 0:20:39,72
THE PRESIDENT: What he referred to is something
I should have talked about earlier, and that


231
0:20:39,72 --> 0:20:45,22
is I set a goal of the United States reducing
our gasoline consumption by 20 percent over


232
0:20:45,22 --> 0:20:51,48
the next 10 years. That's the 20-10 goal.
In other words, it is a goal. And I mandated


233
0:20:51,48 --> 0:20:58,21
a fuel standard that says we'll be using 35
million gallons of ethanol or alternative


234
0:20:58,21 --> 0:21:1,15
fuel over the next 10 years.


235
0:21:1,15 --> 0:21:5,86
Now, the reason I did this is I think it's
possible to do it. And the reason I think


236
0:21:5,86 --> 0:21:9,63
it's possible to do it is because of people
like Kevin telling me it's possible. Remember,


237
0:21:9,63 --> 0:21:16,669
I'm the history major. (Laughter.) And so
the advances you've seen in five years -- if


238
0:21:16,669 --> 0:21:22,13
you're able to take yourself back five years
ago to today, it is a noticeable difference,


239
0:21:22,13 --> 0:21:26,73
a -- obviously reduced the cost of enzyme,
for example, which is an important development.


240
0:21:26,73 --> 0:21:33,77
DR. WENGER: Yes, absolutely, it's a very noticeable
difference and in terms of the number of industry


241
0:21:33,77 --> 0:21:39,72
players that are really interested in this
technology and are also willing to invest


242
0:21:39,72 --> 0:21:44,86
in making this technology happen, including
Novozymes as an industry player, it's really


243
0:21:44,86 --> 0:21:47,429
amazing what we're seeing over the last five
years.


244
0:21:47,429 --> 0:21:53,14
THE PRESIDENT: The high price of energy has
caused private capital to say that it's going


245
0:21:53,14 --> 0:21:57,909
to be impossible for a society like the United
States to sustain its use on gasoline. So


246
0:21:57,909 --> 0:22:4,559
whether it be Novozymes who is investing,
or private sector funds, that money is coming


247
0:22:4,559 --> 0:22:9,669
in. They're fueling new research and development.
So we've got the government helping, but also


248
0:22:9,669 --> 0:22:13,549
you've just got to know that the private sector
is very much involved with trying to invent


249
0:22:13,549 --> 0:22:19,1
the technologies necessary to take advantage
of a society that recognizes it has to diversify


250
0:22:19,1 --> 0:22:20,22
away from energy.


251
0:22:20,22 --> 0:22:26,61
And I repeat to you, we're all connected,
and so when a Chinese economy grows and their


252
0:22:26,61 --> 0:22:32,669
demand for oil goes up, it affects the price
that you pay for gasoline. People got to know


253
0:22:32,669 --> 0:22:37,27
that. And therefore, it's important for us
to continue to advance these kinds of research


254
0:22:37,27 --> 0:22:37,789
projects.


255
0:22:37,789 --> 0:22:43,2
I met Dr. Mike in Greeley, Colorado, a year
ago.


256
0:22:43,2 --> 0:22:45,12
DR. PACHECO: Golden, Colorado.


257
0:22:45,12 --> 0:22:51,4
THE PRESIDENT: Exactly, Golden, Colorado.
How quickly they forget. (Laughter.) I am


258
0:22:51,4 --> 0:22:56,15
60. (Laughter.) Golden, Colorado. Michael,
tell them who you work for.


259
0:22:56,15 --> 0:23:0,44
DR. PACHECO: Mr. President, I work for the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory. We're


260
0:23:0,44 --> 0:23:4,87
the leading laboratory for the Department
of Energy in the field of renewable energy.


261
0:23:4,87 --> 0:23:9,32
We have a very robust program, as you know,
in the field of biofuels, and it's focused


262
0:23:9,32 --> 0:23:12,159
right now on cellulosic ethanol.


263
0:23:12,159 --> 0:23:16,37
I agree with Kevin, your 20-in-10 goal is
very achievable. In fact, the growth of the


264
0:23:16,37 --> 0:23:20,419
corn and the biodiesel industry, which since
you signed the Energy Policy Act two years


265
0:23:20,419 --> 0:23:24,73
ago, have been growing at over 100 percent
per year. Those fuels are going to make a


266
0:23:24,73 --> 0:23:30,2
major portion of that 20 percent. But we have
to, as you indicated, begin the transition


267
0:23:30,2 --> 0:23:32,59
to use a broader base of fuels.


268
0:23:32,59 --> 0:23:38,9
Two years ago we issued a study with USDA,
two agencies together, that showed that the


269
0:23:38,9 --> 0:23:44,14
U.S. could produce enough raw biomass that's
equivalent to about 60 percent of all the


270
0:23:44,14 --> 0:23:48,2
oil that we use in the United States. The
problem is that most of that biomass is not


271
0:23:48,2 --> 0:23:52,45
an easy material to convert. It's not like
corn grain. And so our research --


272
0:23:52,45 --> 0:23:54,19
THE PRESIDENT: Explain to people what you're
talking about.


273
0:23:54,19 --> 0:23:57,999
DR. PACHECO: Things like forest residues,
things like fast-growing trees and switchgrass


274
0:23:57,999 --> 0:24:2,409
-- the major constituent in that material
is a cellulose fiber, usually accounts for


275
0:24:2,409 --> 0:24:3,15
more than half of --


276
0:24:3,15 --> 0:24:6,12
THE PRESIDENT: Do you know what switchgrass
is? Tell them what switchgrass is.


277
0:24:6,12 --> 0:24:9,83
DR. PACHECO: Switchgrass is a native grass
that grew in the Midwest; it's a grass that


278
0:24:9,83 --> 0:24:12,97
grows in relatively poor conditions, it can
survive droughts very well.


279
0:24:12,97 --> 0:24:19,97
THE PRESIDENT: Rocky soil and dry. Sounds
kind of like parts of Texas, doesn't it? (Laughter.)


280
0:24:19,97 --> 0:24:25,59
Imagine, however, if you're able to grow a
grass where it's rocky soil and dry that you're


281
0:24:25,59 --> 0:24:31,7
able to convert into energy. You're talking
about a major change in the lifestyle of your


282
0:24:31,7 --> 0:24:36,87
children and my children and their kids. I
mean, this is -- anyway, go ahead. (Laughter.)


283
0:24:36,87 --> 0:24:39,23
DR. PACHECO: You're doing very well. (Laughter.)


284
0:24:39,23 --> 0:24:43,65
THE PRESIDENT: I am passionate on the subject.
(Laughter and applause.)


285
0:24:43,65 --> 0:24:57,4
DR. PACHECO: But that's a 
really big part of it, Mr. President, being
able to move to those marginal conditions


286
0:24:57,4 --> 0:25:1,88
and grow crops in areas where we're not currently
growing crops, and then to have those crops


287
0:25:1,88 --> 0:25:6,52
that are specifically designed to produce
feedstocks that are adapted well for the enzymes


288
0:25:6,52 --> 0:25:11,59
that Novozymes is producing can really increase
the yield -- that is, how much ethanol we


289
0:25:11,59 --> 0:25:12,85
can make from a ton of biomass.


290
0:25:12,85 --> 0:25:18,61
One of the challenges when we started this
project between NREL and Novozymes was that


291
0:25:18,61 --> 0:25:23,309
no one in the world really felt like enzymes
could be a cost-effective technology in producing


292
0:25:23,309 --> 0:25:28,21
ethanol from raw material. Today all the leading
researchers in the world are working in that


293
0:25:28,21 --> 0:25:33,24
area because of the partnerships and because
of the progress that Kevin has already talked


294
0:25:33,24 --> 0:25:33,65
about.


295
0:25:33,65 --> 0:25:37,61
But we're not there yet. And while I'm optimistic,
like Kevin, there's still a lot of hard work


296
0:25:37,61 --> 0:25:41,96
left to do, Mr. President. And we have work
in the pre-treatment area, we have work still


297
0:25:41,96 --> 0:25:46,14
to do in the enzymatic hydrolysis, and we
still have research in the fermentation side.


298
0:25:46,14 --> 0:25:51,49
And so DOE right now is considering proposals
to work with industry in the area of developing


299
0:25:51,49 --> 0:25:55,559
fermentation organisms, which is a really
important part because the yeast, the bugs


300
0:25:55,559 --> 0:26:0,2
today that we use to make ethanol won't work
in the future with these new feedstocks. So


301
0:26:0,2 --> 0:26:2,69
it's really important that we start this transition.


302
0:26:2,69 --> 0:26:7,32
At NREL we work with all the other national
labs. We especially work with Argon National


303
0:26:7,32 --> 0:26:13,529
Lab and Pacific Northwest and Idaho and Oakridge.
Those are all labs that work together within


304
0:26:13,529 --> 0:26:17,63
my center, and we try to coordinate our efforts
to utilize all the skills at the national


305
0:26:17,63 --> 0:26:21,58
laboratories, because each of the labs brings
a unique set of skills to this challenging


306
0:26:21,58 --> 0:26:26,7
problem. We also work with a lot of other
companies, in addition to Novozymes. And those


307
0:26:26,7 --> 0:26:29,84
interactions are equally as important, because
one of the things that we're trying to do,


308
0:26:29,84 --> 0:26:33,62
Mr. President -- when we talked last year
we talked about this -- is to try to develop


309
0:26:33,62 --> 0:26:38,75
transitions that grow from existing industries.
So instead of replacing the corn ethanol industry,


310
0:26:38,75 --> 0:26:41,36
we see cellulosic as evolving from it.


311
0:26:41,36 --> 0:26:45,94
Similarly, we can see how the pulp and paper
industry might be able to evolve into bio


312
0:26:45,94 --> 0:26:50,46
refineries. Maybe even the massive petroleum
refineries can someday evolve to take biomass


313
0:26:50,46 --> 0:26:54,15
materials, and you know we're doing some research
in that area, as well.


314
0:26:54,15 --> 0:26:58,409
It's really important that we stay on this
track, because in the long run, there's no


315
0:26:58,409 --> 0:27:4,39
other sustainable source of liquid transportation
fuels other than biomass. So we have to succeed


316
0:27:4,39 --> 0:27:4,39
at this.


317
0:27:4,39 --> 0:27:7,19
THE PRESIDENT: You know, it's interesting,
you're probably wondering whether or not automobiles


318
0:27:7,19 --> 0:27:13,75
can be easily converted to use ethanol, and
the answer is, absolutely. There's a lot of


319
0:27:13,75 --> 0:27:21,94
automobiles in the Midwest that are filling
up with 85 percent ethanol, called E85 pumps.


320
0:27:21,94 --> 0:27:30,59
It doesn't take much. So one of the barriers
to the advent of a lot of ethanol use is not


321
0:27:30,59 --> 0:27:34,9
the automobile. It's easy to convert them.
As a matter of fact, some of you out there


322
0:27:34,9 --> 0:27:40,84
probably have got a car that can use ethanol
and you just don't know it -- flex-fuel automobiles,


323
0:27:40,84 --> 0:27:41,659
they're called.


324
0:27:41,659 --> 0:27:46,669
Secondly, the production process. Once we
figure out what needs to take place internally,


325
0:27:46,669 --> 0:27:52,33
it's not that expensive, relative to huge
gasoline refineries. What will happen is,


326
0:27:52,33 --> 0:27:58,98
when you get a wood chip breakthrough, for
example, where it becomes cost effective,


327
0:27:58,98 --> 0:28:4,52
you're going to have ethanol production plants
all across North Carolina, where the wood


328
0:28:4,52 --> 0:28:7,99
chips can be gathered.


329
0:28:7,99 --> 0:28:11,62
One of the reasons we keep talking about costs,
it's just real practical. Somebody is not


330
0:28:11,62 --> 0:28:16,89
going to fill up their car with ethanol if
it costs a lot more than gasoline. The consumer


331
0:28:16,89 --> 0:28:24,96
is pretty wise, and they care about the environment,
no question about it. But if a person is having


332
0:28:24,96 --> 0:28:31,57
to drive back and forth to work, they're going
to generally pick the most economically competitive


333
0:28:31,57 --> 0:28:39,35
fuel to do that. People want to keep money
in their pocket, and therefore, if it costs


334
0:28:39,35 --> 0:28:43,14
less using gasoline, they'll use it. So, therefore,
that's why we're driving these research dollars,


335
0:28:43,14 --> 0:28:50,29
to get the cost of producing ethanol down
so it can compete. And it's going to happen,


336
0:28:50,29 --> 0:28:54,2
because as that price of oil goes up, the
price of gasoline goes up, which makes ethanol


337
0:28:54,2 --> 0:28:58,44
more competitive. And one reason -- just so
you know -- one reason why there's been such


338
0:28:58,44 --> 0:29:4,74
a push, is because when the price of oil went
up from early 2001 to where it is today, about


339
0:29:4,74 --> 0:29:9,909
$60 a barrel, people saying, we may not be
able to sustain this, we better get moving.


340
0:29:9,909 --> 0:29:11,46
And that's what's happening.


341
0:29:11,46 --> 0:29:16,559
North Carolina State. Ratna. Welcome. Thank
you. You're a doctor of?


342
0:29:16,559 --> 0:29:18,24
DR. SHARMA: Biological engineering.


343
0:29:18,24 --> 0:29:28,7
THE PRESIDENT: Biological engineering. Chemical
engineering. Biological engineering. (Laughter.)


344
0:29:28,7 --> 0:29:33,549
People should be getting the picture that
we've got a lot of smart people working on


345
0:29:33,549 --> 0:29:38,0
this project. When you've got Ph.D.s surrounding
the President talking about doing what's right,


346
0:29:38,0 --> 0:29:42,2
we've got a lot of brain power working on
it. And that's where you're going to get your


347
0:29:42,2 --> 0:29:42,62
breakthroughs.


348
0:29:42,62 --> 0:29:43,85
So what are you working on?


349
0:29:43,85 --> 0:29:47,82
DR. SHARMA: Mr. President, first of all, I'd
like to thank you for your support and interest


350
0:29:47,82 --> 0:29:53,7
in the development of these technologies for
cellulosic ethanol.


351
0:29:53,7 --> 0:29:59,9
I essentially represent all the research of
my colleagues at North Carolina State University


352
0:29:59,9 --> 0:30:5,679
and across the country in different universities
who have been working in this area of converting


353
0:30:5,679 --> 0:30:13,399
residues from the farm, forest, animal operations,
possibly even food industry waste to convert


354
0:30:13,399 --> 0:30:21,36
it into ethanol and make our country self-reliant
and achieve the goal of 20-in-10.


355
0:30:21,36 --> 0:30:27,46
But, as has been mentioned, there are challenges.
We have to overcome those, and it's possible


356
0:30:27,46 --> 0:30:34,649
we can do that. We do need more investment
and funding support, definitely, to speed


357
0:30:34,649 --> 0:30:37,12
up this process of achieving this goal in
10 years.


358
0:30:37,12 --> 0:30:41,72
THE PRESIDENT: So what do you think? I mean,
how long have you been doing this for?


359
0:30:41,72 --> 0:30:43,9
DR. SHARMA: I've been doing this for about
four years.


360
0:30:43,9 --> 0:30:48,799
THE PRESIDENT: Really? So when you got your
Ph.D. you never dreamt you'd be thinking about


361
0:30:48,799 --> 0:30:52,309
converting wood to oil for fuel. What did
you feel?


362
0:30:52,309 --> 0:30:57,88
DR. SHARMA: Well, I was trained as an agricultural
engineer, and I grew up on -- on an ag university


363
0:30:57,88 --> 0:31:4,96
campus with farms around me. So I always saw
residues lying around and plants and stuff.


364
0:31:4,96 --> 0:31:10,299
And I got my Ph.D. in food safety engineering
where I learned about microorganisms. So then


365
0:31:10,299 --> 0:31:16,36
I saw this opportunity, it was like putting
together engineering and microbiology, to


366
0:31:16,36 --> 0:31:20,45
process something and get value from something
that's typically not --


367
0:31:20,45 --> 0:31:22,97
THE PRESIDENT: And there are other people
at North Carolina State working with you on


368
0:31:22,97 --> 0:31:23,44
this project?


369
0:31:23,44 --> 0:31:29,29
DR. SHARMA: Yes, there are. There are people
working on utilizing forest residues, wood


370
0:31:29,29 --> 0:31:34,21
chips for converting to ethanol. There are
people working on different ag residues -- sweet


371
0:31:34,21 --> 0:31:40,71
potatoes, which is a starch, base feedstock,
people working on biodiesel, from -- again,


372
0:31:40,71 --> 0:31:43,11
from agricultural resources.


373
0:31:43,11 --> 0:31:47,61
So there are a lot of people working on overcoming
the challenges of pretreatment and converting


374
0:31:47,61 --> 0:31:55,399
the carbohydrates into sugars and then eventually
fermenting it into ethanol. And my focus has


375
0:31:55,399 --> 0:32:1,23
been more on ag residues, like cotton stalks,
hays and straws, which would typically not


376
0:32:1,23 --> 0:32:1,429
be --


377
0:32:1,429 --> 0:32:2,909
THE PRESIDENT: Cotton stalks, pretty interesting,
isn't it?


378
0:32:2,909 --> 0:32:3,76
DR. SHARMA: They are.


379
0:32:3,76 --> 0:32:10,1
THE PRESIDENT: They now get plowed up in the
ground. Your idea is to get them so they can


380
0:32:10,1 --> 0:32:11,549
end up in somebody's automobile, not in the
ground.


381
0:32:11,549 --> 0:32:16,7
DR. SHARMA: Exactly. So there is a lot of
potential. And like switchgrass, which grows


382
0:32:16,7 --> 0:32:22,26
in marginal lands. And we have, like you mentioned,
a big swine industry in North Carolina. So


383
0:32:22,26 --> 0:32:28,289
the advantage is we could possibly put the
two together, use animal waste as a nutrient


384
0:32:28,289 --> 0:32:33,44
source to grow the switchgrass and then convert
it into ethanol so you're getting energy from


385
0:32:33,44 --> 0:32:33,57
waste.


386
0:32:33,57 --> 0:32:37,11
THE PRESIDENT: So are people pretty upbeat
about it? People --


387
0:32:37,11 --> 0:32:44,779
DR. SHARMA: Well, people who are aware and
looking forward to switching from fossil fuels


388
0:32:44,779 --> 0:32:46,61
to renewable energy, yes, they are.


389
0:32:46,61 --> 0:32:48,24
THE PRESIDENT: Yes, pretty good.


390
0:32:48,24 --> 0:32:52,95
DR. SHARMA: And they feel it's achievable.
We can do it. We just need to work a little


391
0:32:52,95 --> 0:32:53,559
harder on that.


392
0:32:53,559 --> 0:32:58,799
THE PRESIDENT: Yes. A little more money and
a little harder. (Laughter.) Talk to my man,


393
0:32:58,799 --> 0:33:3,149
Michael. He's the guy distributing some of
the money. (Laughter.) Well, good. Thanks,


394
0:33:3,149 --> 0:33:4,6
Doc. Thanks for joining us. I'm sure proud
you're here. NC State is a fine, fine institution.


395
0:33:4,6 --> 0:33:4,86
I know you're proud to work there.


396
0:33:4,86 --> 0:33:5,559
DR. SHARMA: Yes, I am, definitely.


397
0:33:5,559 --> 0:33:11,269
THE PRESIDENT: Ryan, where are you from?


398
0:33:11,269 --> 0:33:15,59
MR. ADOLPHSON: From the University of Georgia
in Athens, Georgia.


399
0:33:15,59 --> 0:33:19,73
THE PRESIDENT: A bold man to come here to
North Carolina. (Laughter.) A great school,


400
0:33:19,73 --> 0:33:22,69
by the way. What do you do?


401
0:33:22,69 --> 0:33:28,679
MR. ADOLPHSON: I'm with the university's -- I'm
in charge of our bio -- our pilot facilities


402
0:33:28,679 --> 0:33:33,19
that are looking into early transitioning
some of this technology from the bench out


403
0:33:33,19 --> 0:33:38,73
to industry, looking at really the wide, or
broad spectrum of this concept of biomass


404
0:33:38,73 --> 0:33:44,399
to energy that includes fuels and includes
electrical and different bio products, and


405
0:33:44,399 --> 0:33:51,13
really running the gamut of this whole type
of industry. And we have a pretty large research


406
0:33:51,13 --> 0:33:53,58
facility looking into this at all levels.


407
0:33:53,58 --> 0:33:54,169
THE PRESIDENT: In Athens?


408
0:33:54,169 --> 0:33:57,659
MR. ADOLPHSON: In Athens, yes -- bio-refining
and carbon cycling center that we've recently


409
0:33:57,659 --> 0:33:58,59
started in the last two years.


410
0:33:58,59 --> 0:34:1,71
THE PRESIDENT: What is a bio -- what is a
carbon recycling center?


411
0:34:1,71 --> 0:34:2,789
MR. ADOLPHSON: Carbon cycling.


412
0:34:2,789 --> 0:34:3,519
THE PRESIDENT: Carbon cycling.


413
0:34:3,519 --> 0:34:7,49
MR. ADOLPHSON: Right. So we're looking into
the concept of a bio refinery, which Mike


414
0:34:7,49 --> 0:34:11,3
mentioned, and really taking a little bit
bigger picture view, stepping back, not looking


415
0:34:11,3 --> 0:34:15,5
only at ethanol, but counting ethanol as a
significant piece to the puzzle, but looking


416
0:34:15,5 --> 0:34:19,609
at all the other products that can be generated
from bio mass. You know, similar to a petroleum


417
0:34:19,609 --> 0:34:23,119
refinery that takes a barrel of crude and
doesn't just make diesel and gasoline, but


418
0:34:23,119 --> 0:34:25,169
50, 60 other products out of that.


419
0:34:25,169 --> 0:34:29,51
So we're looking at our wood chips as that
barrel of crude, taking that, and turning


420
0:34:29,51 --> 0:34:33,629
it into a larger profit stream than just a
single product, and we believe that's going


421
0:34:33,629 --> 0:34:34,47
to drive the economics --


422
0:34:34,47 --> 0:34:34,909
THE PRESIDENT: What other products?


423
0:34:34,909 --> 0:34:38,32
MR. ADOLPHSON: There's a whole host of products.
You know, the char, the stuff that's in a


424
0:34:38,32 --> 0:34:42,899
thermochemical process, instead of a biological
process, or the sugar platform. The Department


425
0:34:42,899 --> 0:34:48,19
of Energy really breaks up when they talk
about our production of ethanol in two pathways:


426
0:34:48,19 --> 0:34:52,24
one is thermochemical and the other is our
fermentation, or our sugar platform that we've


427
0:34:52,24 --> 0:34:54,2
kind of been talking about now.


428
0:34:54,2 --> 0:34:58,31
The thermochemical platform allows us to take
all these different biomass streams, treat


429
0:34:58,31 --> 0:35:3,359
them with heat in a certain way, release all
of the energy from those, and we can capture


430
0:35:3,359 --> 0:35:4,77
that, turn that into our product.


431
0:35:4,77 --> 0:35:8,96
So one product we have left is the carbon
that's left over. We're able to look at that


432
0:35:8,96 --> 0:35:12,17
as a soil amendment and take that carbon without
releasing it into the atmosphere and put it


433
0:35:12,17 --> 0:35:16,1
back into the ground. And then we have everything
that comes out of that biomass that we can


434
0:35:16,1 --> 0:35:20,71
turn into ethanol and we can turn into specialty
chemicals for our chemical industry as precursors


435
0:35:20,71 --> 0:35:25,3
to things like nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals,
and then we have the gas that comes off that


436
0:35:25,3 --> 0:35:29,3
could be maybe cleaned up and used as a pipeline-quality
gas, like natural gas, to heat homes.


437
0:35:29,3 --> 0:35:31,109
THE PRESIDENT: All from one big pile of wood
chips?


438
0:35:31,109 --> 0:35:35,21
MR. ADOLPHSON: All from one big pile of wood
chips, right. You know, we're at a very unique


439
0:35:35,21 --> 0:35:35,21
place --


440
0:35:35,21 --> 0:35:38,17
THE PRESIDENT: You've got to dream big in
order to be able to get it done. (Laughter.)


441
0:35:38,17 --> 0:35:38,869
That's good.


442
0:35:38,869 --> 0:35:42,4
MR. ADOLPHSON: We are at a unique place right
now, and the technology is there.


443
0:35:42,4 --> 0:35:46,65
THE PRESIDENT: Pretty interesting, isn't it?
It's -- I'm not so sure if they'd believe


444
0:35:46,65 --> 0:35:51,66
me in the coffee shop in Crawford if I told
him what he just told me. (Laughter.) But


445
0:35:51,66 --> 0:35:51,93
it's possible.


446
0:35:51,93 --> 0:35:56,89
MR. ADOLPHSON: It is, right. I like to say,
we're not there yet, but we can see it from


447
0:35:56,89 --> 0:35:56,29
here.


448
0:35:56,29 --> 0:35:57,27
THE PRESIDENT: You can, yes.


449
0:35:57,27 --> 0:36:1,64
MR. ADOLPHSON: We've got two -- on the ground
in the next 18 months in Georgia, we've got


450
0:36:1,64 --> 0:36:6,76
a biorefinery taking wood chips to ethanol,
we've got a traditional corn ethanol plant


451
0:36:6,76 --> 0:36:10,44
going in, we've got two, what we call, integrated
biorefineries that are going to be pulling


452
0:36:10,44 --> 0:36:16,57
mostly -- we have 24 million acres of commercial
forest in Georgia. So that's a big priority


453
0:36:16,57 --> 0:36:20,29
for us. And the pulp and paper industry has
been -- has been going other places.


454
0:36:20,29 --> 0:36:21,329
THE PRESIDENT: Are they investing?


455
0:36:21,329 --> 0:36:22,28
MR. ADOLPHSON: The industry itself?


456
0:36:22,28 --> 0:36:22,97
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.


457
0:36:22,97 --> 0:36:27,52
MR. ADOLPHSON: The part of the pulp and paper
industry, that is the growers, the land owners,


458
0:36:27,52 --> 0:36:31,619
are very interested in finding a market for
their wood so they can get a higher price


459
0:36:31,619 --> 0:36:35,329
for it. I think the paper mills might be less
interested in paying a higher price for their


460
0:36:35,329 --> 0:36:39,579
feed stock than the growers are. But yes,
they're definitely investing. The University


461
0:36:39,579 --> 0:36:44,39
and Governor Purdue has sent a mandate out
for us to really invest in public/private


462
0:36:44,39 --> 0:36:48,2
partnerships. So we can take the public money,
and he likes to say he wants to see industry


463
0:36:48,2 --> 0:36:53,3
with skin in the game, who is able to put
money and people involved in this effort.


464
0:36:53,3 --> 0:36:58,339
And so we're -- we've created a facility.
We can locate industry on campus with us,


465
0:36:58,339 --> 0:37:2,76
so that when we do develop a technology, this
technology transfer from academia to industry


466
0:37:2,76 --> 0:37:7,45
is seamless. We're excited about that because
guys like us who are in academia or government,


467
0:37:7,45 --> 0:37:10,45
we can provide money and resources, but it's
going to be the market that will have to pick


468
0:37:10,45 --> 0:37:15,0
it up and take it to get it into the consumers.


469
0:37:15,0 --> 0:37:15,74
THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely, yes. That's pretty
interesting, isn't it? Thanks for coming.


470
0:37:15,74 --> 0:37:16,53
I'm glad you came over.


471
0:37:16,53 --> 0:37:19,2
MR. ADOLPHSON: Thank you, Mr. President. We're
excited to be here. Great opportunity.


472
0:37:19,2 --> 0:37:21,95
THE PRESIDENT: And we're going to end up with
Terry. Terry Ruse.


473
0:37:21,95 --> 0:37:26,77
MR. RUSE: All of the Ph.D.s around the table.
I don't have one of those, but I --


474
0:37:26,77 --> 0:37:29,66
THE PRESIDENT: I'm glad to join you. (Laughter.)


475
0:37:29,66 --> 0:37:35,98
MR. RUSE: I'm happy to report to you that
the ethanol industry is alive and well and


476
0:37:35,98 --> 0:37:37,45
up and taking nourishment.


477
0:37:37,45 --> 0:37:38,32
THE PRESIDENT: So what do you do?


478
0:37:38,32 --> 0:37:43,3
MR. RUSE: I am the Chief Operating Officer
for Agri-Ethanol. That's a privately-held


479
0:37:43,3 --> 0:37:44,3
ethanol company in Raleigh.


480
0:37:44,3 --> 0:37:45,4
THE PRESIDENT: And what do you -- so what
--


481
0:37:45,4 --> 0:37:51,32
MR. RUSE: We are developing -- our strategic
plan is to develop 10, 108-million-gallon-a-year


482
0:37:51,32 --> 0:37:52,89
ethanol plants in the --


483
0:37:52,89 --> 0:37:53,68
THE PRESIDENT: So you're going to be the manufacturer?


484
0:37:53,68 --> 0:37:59,79
MR. RUSE: We are going to be the manufacturer.
Thanks to the vision of Dave Brady and the


485
0:37:59,79 --> 0:38:7,3
guys that own Agri-Ethanol, I've been able
to develop a really flexible project in that


486
0:38:7,3 --> 0:38:13,369
we have a design to start out as a corn plant
to process corn. We were building 11,000 foot


487
0:38:13,369 --> 0:38:19,3
of track -- big loop track to be able to bring
corn in by rail and take ethanol back out.


488
0:38:19,3 --> 0:38:24,8
In the center of that loop track, we've engineered
the ability to handle wood chips. We've got


489
0:38:24,8 --> 0:38:32,3
all that in place. We have a CO2 company that
will process the CO2, anything -- any of the


490
0:38:32,3 --> 0:38:38,97
CO2 that doesn't go to that direction to make
food grade liquid carbon dioxide will be directed


491
0:38:38,97 --> 0:38:45,119
into hydroponic gardening or into growing
algae to support an adjacent biodiesel plant.


492
0:38:45,119 --> 0:38:48,2
Now we have the real estate to put one of
those on.


493
0:38:48,2 --> 0:38:52,75
THE PRESIDENT: So you intend to buy the enzymes
from this company to run in your plant --


494
0:38:52,75 --> 0:38:57,99
MR. RUSE: We have this -- as a matter of fact,
we have offered them the opportunity to establish


495
0:38:57,99 --> 0:39:3,6
a field research laboratory on our site so
that they don't have to go long distances


496
0:39:3,6 --> 0:39:5,66
to get their people and do really ground work
--


497
0:39:5,66 --> 0:39:6,96
THE PRESIDENT: Where is this thing?


498
0:39:6,96 --> 0:39:11,81
MR. RUSE: It's in Aurora, North Carolina.
It's the first one. It's about 160 miles east


499
0:39:11,81 --> 0:39:12,369
of Raleigh.


500
0:39:12,369 --> 0:39:16,25
THE PRESIDENT: And when will you -- are you
building it now?


501
0:39:16,25 --> 0:39:22,579
MR. RUSE: We are ready to break ground. One
of the interesting facts about that is that


502
0:39:22,579 --> 0:39:27,92
we have the site completely controlled. We
have it totally permitted. But in trying to


503
0:39:27,92 --> 0:39:33,19
talk to the financial people about putting
money, I've spent two years trying to convince


504
0:39:33,19 --> 0:39:37,849
them that it makes sense to build an ethanol
plant in North Carolina as much as it does


505
0:39:37,849 --> 0:39:42,46
one in Iowa. And we haven't gotten that done.
And so --


506
0:39:42,46 --> 0:39:45,839
THE PRESIDENT: See, you can't build a plant
far away from the raw material. That's the


507
0:39:45,839 --> 0:39:51,119
interesting thing about this industry. What
he's basically saying is, is that investors


508
0:39:51,119 --> 0:39:56,79
think you have to be in the middle of a corn
field. Really. And that's why there's a lot


509
0:39:56,79 --> 0:40:0,23
of plants being built in the Midwest because
there's a lot of corn in the Midwest.


510
0:40:0,23 --> 0:40:5,14
MR. RUSE: But because of the fact we're closer
to the population density centers for the


511
0:40:5,14 --> 0:40:10,75
ethanol, and the animals that we have in North
Carolina, we can prove that our plant is as


512
0:40:10,75 --> 0:40:13,22
competitive as the plant in Iowa.


513
0:40:13,22 --> 0:40:18,6
THE PRESIDENT: You can't have a centralized
plant and ship your ethanol long distances,


514
0:40:18,6 --> 0:40:25,27
either. The production needs to be close to
the raw material and the users, is what you're


515
0:40:25,27 --> 0:40:27,4
saying. And the economics.


516
0:40:27,4 --> 0:40:31,52
MR. RUSE: That's exactly correct. And this
-- each one of these plants will produce about


517
0:40:31,52 --> 0:40:37,24
400,000 tons a year of highly digestible,
high protein feed to help the hog farmers,


518
0:40:37,24 --> 0:40:39,94
that you alluded to, get over their heart
pain of --


519
0:40:39,94 --> 0:40:40,18
THE PRESIDENT: High corn.


520
0:40:40,18 --> 0:40:46,4
MR. RUSE: Of high corn. And coming from the
farm, the thing that I understand most is


521
0:40:46,4 --> 0:40:51,94
the resiliency of the American farmer. You
give him a good price for the corn, and he


522
0:40:51,94 --> 0:40:57,89
will grow the corn. And I think that when
the March planning report comes out, you'll


523
0:40:57,89 --> 0:41:4,3
see closer to 13 billion or 13.5 billion bushel
corn market, and 90 million acres planted


524
0:41:4,3 --> 0:41:5,48
than what we've seen in the past.


525
0:41:5,48 --> 0:41:12,28
And so all of the price concerns from the
animal growers and from the Wall Streeters


526
0:41:12,28 --> 0:41:14,38
will be --


527
0:41:14,38 --> 0:41:16,119
THE PRESIDENT: Will be eased somewhat. That's
right. He's right. It's amazing how the market


528
0:41:16,119 --> 0:41:16,53
responds.


529
0:41:16,53 --> 0:41:21,64
MR. RUSE: And the one last piece of our project
is that we intend to build a green truck stop


530
0:41:21,64 --> 0:41:25,77
on each one of these sites that sells biodiesel,
sell E10 and E85.


531
0:41:25,77 --> 0:41:28,71
THE PRESIDENT: That would be good. E10 is
ethanol -- 10 percent ethanol.


532
0:41:28,71 --> 0:41:32,15
MR. RUSE: Ten percent ethanol and 85 percent
ethanol and then biodiesel.


533
0:41:32,15 --> 0:41:38,69
THE PRESIDENT: The purpose was to give everybody
a sense of where a lot of smart people and


534
0:41:38,69 --> 0:41:45,24
good capital are moving. Smart people are
here working on some amazing technologies


535
0:41:45,24 --> 0:41:49,98
that -- you know, that I believe 10 years
from now people will say, gosh, it's interesting


536
0:41:49,98 --> 0:41:55,4
that they were worried about this particular
technology coming to fruition, because it's


537
0:41:55,4 --> 0:42:2,22
coming to fruition. And the role of the government
is to stimulate thought and investment and


538
0:42:2,22 --> 0:42:9,72
set goals. And we set a big goal, really have
-- reduction of gasoline by 20 percent over


539
0:42:9,72 --> 0:42:10,99
the next 10 years.


540
0:42:10,99 --> 0:42:15,72
I wouldn't have done that if I didn't think
it was achievable. Part of it is to change


541
0:42:15,72 --> 0:42:20,18
our CAFE standards on automobiles, which will
encourage conservation. The other part is


542
0:42:20,18 --> 0:42:24,68
to change the fuel -- fuel mix across America.


543
0:42:24,68 --> 0:42:28,39
And this is a coming time. It really is. And
I want to thank those of you who are on the


544
0:42:28,39 --> 0:42:33,93
front line of changing it. It must be exciting
for you to be able to work on something so


545
0:42:33,93 --> 0:42:38,859
novel and so encouraging and so important
for our country.


546
0:42:38,859 --> 0:42:43,19
I thank the good folks at this important company
for letting me come by to say hello. I ask


547
0:42:43,19 --> 0:44:43,19
for God's blessings on the United States of
America. Thank you. (Applause.)
