###84 NARRATOR: The Free Syrian Army was formed by the Syrian armed
###87 forces to the fact that the president Bashar Al-Assad
###90 ordered them to open fire on civilians protesting in the
###93 midst of the Arab Spring.
###97 Since then, FSA brigades have sprung up in cities all
###100 throughout the country and have grown to include
###104 civilians of all stripes.
###107 Once farmers, college students, blue collar workers
###110 and small business owners, these volunteers have taken up
###114 arms and joined the ranks of the FSA.
###115 
###120 On the front lines with the Free Syrian Army in Aleppo, I
