0:0:5,0 --> 0:0:13,0
Adam Steltzner 'When people look at it...  uhhh, it looks crazy. That's a very natural thing.'


3
0:0:13,0 --> 0:0:18,0
'Sometimes when we look at it, it looks crazy.'


4
0:0:18,0 --> 0:0:25,0
'It is the result of reasoned, engineering thought.'


5
0:0:25,0 --> 0:0:28,0
'But it still looks crazy.'


6
0:0:28,0 --> 0:0:32,0
'From the top of the atmosphere, down to the surface-'


7
0:0:32,0 --> 0:0:34,0
'It takes us seven minutes.'


8
0:0:34,0 --> 0:0:42,0
'It takes 14 minutes or so for the signal from the spacecraft to make it to Earth-'


9
0:0:42,0 --> 0:0:46,0
' that's how far Mars is away from us.'


10
0:0:46,0 --> 0:0:53,0
'So, when we first get word that we've touched the top of the atmosphere,'


11
0:0:53,0 --> 0:0:55,0
'the vehicle has been alive...'
(music intensifies- heavier percussion)


12
0:0:55,0 --> 0:1:7,0
'or dead, on the surface, for at least seven minutes.'
(music crescendos- dark pounding drums)


13
0:1:7,0 --> 0:1:12,0
Tom Rivellini: 'Entry, descent and landing, also known as EDL, is referred to as the '7 minutes of terror'.'


14
0:1:12,0 --> 0:1:21,0
'Because we've got literally seven minutes to get from the top of the atmosphere to the surface of Mars-'


15
0:1:21,0 --> 0:1:26,0
'going from 13,000 miles an hour to zero, in perfect sequence, perfect choreography, perfect timing...'


16
0:1:26,0 --> 0:1:31,0
'and the computer has to do it all by itself, with no help from the ground.'


17
0:1:31,0 --> 0:1:35,0
'If any one thing doesn't work just right, it's game over.'


18
0:1:35,0 --> 0:1:37,0
(whoosh)
(music -tension/drums steadily building)


19
0:1:37,0 --> 0:1:41,0
Adam Steltzner: 'We slam into the atmosphere and develop so much aerodynamic drag,'


20
0:1:41,0 --> 0:1:45,0
'our heat shield, it heats up and it glows like the surface of the sun.'


21
0:1:45,0 --> 0:1:49,0
'1600 degrees!'


22
0:1:49,0 --> 0:1:54,0
Miguel San Martin: 'During entry, the vehicle is not only slowing down- violently, though the atmosphere,'


23
0:1:54,0 --> 0:2:2,0
'but also we are guiding it, like an airplane! to be able to land in a very narrow, constrained space.'


24
0:2:2,0 --> 0:2:9,0
'This is one of the biggest challenges that we are facing, and one that we have never attempted at Mars.'


25
0:2:9,0 --> 0:2:12,0
Tom Rivellini: 'Mars- it's actually really hard to slow down,'


26
0:2:12,0 --> 0:2:15,0
'because it has just enough atmosphere, that you have to deal with it-'


27
0:2:15,0 --> 0:2:17,0
'otherwise, it will destroy your spacecraft.'


28
0:2:17,0 --> 0:2:23,0
'On the other hand, it doesnt have enough atmosphere to finish the job.'


29
0:2:23,0 --> 0:2:25,0
'We're still going about 1000 miles an hour.'


30
0:2:25,0 --> 0:2:28,0
'So at that point we use a parachute.'


31
0:2:28,0 --> 0:2:32,0
Anita Sengupta: 'The parachute is the largest and strongest super-sonic parachute-'


32
0:2:32,0 --> 0:2:33,0
'that we've ever built to date.'


33
0:2:33,0 --> 0:2:40,0
'It has to withstand 65,000 pounds of force! even though the parachute itself only weighs about 100 pounds.'


34
0:2:40,0 --> 0:2:44,0
(blast-whoosh)


35
0:2:44,0 --> 0:2:49,0
Tom Rivellini: 'When it opens up that fast, it's a neck-snapping 9G's!'


36
0:2:49,0 --> 0:2:51,0
Steve Lee: 'At that point we have to get that heat shield off.'


37
0:2:51,0 --> 0:2:55,0
'It's like a big lens cap, blocking our view of the ground to the radar.'


38
0:2:55,0 --> 0:3:0,0
'The radar has to take just the right altitude and velocity measurements at just the right time-'


39
0:3:0,0 --> 0:3:2,0
'or the rest of the landing sequence wont work.'


40
0:3:2,0 --> 0:3:6,0
(heavy wind sound)
(music pulsing/intense)


41
0:3:6,0 --> 0:2:8,0
Tom Rivellini: 'This big huge parachute that we've got-'


42
0:2:8,0 --> 0:3:11,0
'it'll only slow us down to about 200 miles an hour.'


43
0:3:11,0 --> 0:3:14,0
'And that's not slow enough to land.'


44
0:3:14,0 --> 0:3:17,0
'So we have no choice but we've got to cut it off!'


45
0:3:17,0 --> 0:3:18,0
(whoosh)
(music cuts)


46
0:3:18,0 --> 0:3:20,0
'And then come down on rockets.'


47
0:3:20,0 --> 0:3:21,0
(engines blast)


48
0:3:21,0 --> 0:3:22,0
'Once we turn those rocket motors on-'


49
0:3:22,0 --> 0:3:25,0
'if we dont do something, we're just going to smack right back into the parachute!'


50
0:3:25,0 --> 0:3:26,0
(engines blast)
(music- big pounding drums)


51
0:3:26,0 --> 0:3:30,0
'So the first thing we do is make this really radical 'divert maneuver''


52
0:3:30,0 --> 0:3:32,0
'We fly off to the side.'


53
0:3:32,0 --> 0:3:38,0
Adam Steltzner: 'Diverting away from the parachute, killing our horizontal velocity and our vertical velocity'


54
0:3:38,0 --> 0:3:44,0
'getting the rover moving straight up and down, so it can look at the surface with its radar-'


55
0:3:44,0 --> 0:3:45,0
'and see where we're gonna land.'


56
0:3:45,0 --> 0:3:48,0
'And we head straight down'


57
0:3:48,0 --> 0:3:50,0
'to the bottom of a crater'


58
0:3:50,0 --> 0:3:53,0
'right beside a six kilometer-high mountain!'


59
0:3:53,0 --> 0:3:55,0
(music- grand)


60
0:3:55,0 --> 0:3:58,0
Anita Sengupta: 'We can't get those rocket engines too close to the ground.'


61
0:3:58,0 --> 0:4:2,0
'Because if we were to descent propulsively all the way to the ground-


62
0:4:2,0 --> 0:4:6,0
'we would essentially create this massive dust cloud. That dust cloud could then land on the rover-'


63
0:4:6,0 --> 0:4:9,0
'It could damage mechanisms and it could damage instruments.'


64
0:4:9,0 --> 0:4:14,0
'So the way we solve that problem, is by using the skycrane maneuver.'


65
0:4:14,0 --> 0:4:20,0
Adam Steltzner: '20 meters above the surface, we have to lower the rover below us-'


66
0:4:20,0 --> 0:4:23,0
'on a tether that's 21 feet long.'


67
0:4:23,0 --> 0:4:27,0
'And then deposit it, on its wheels, on the surface.'


68
0:4:27,0 --> 0:4:28,0
(music- intense and climactic)


69
0:4:28,0 --> 0:4:31,0
Miguel San Martin: 'As the rover touches down and is now on the ground,'


70
0:4:31,0 --> 0:4:34,0
'the descent stage- it's on a collision course with the rover!'


71
0:4:34,0 --> 0:4:39,0
'We must cut the bridal immediately and fly the descent stage to a safe distance from the rover.'


72
0:4:39,0 --> 0:4:44,0
(music crescendos and ends)
(thunderous rockets echo)


73
0:4:44,0 --> 0:4:50,0
(music-final orchestra hit over dark drone)
(wind in background)


74
0:4:50,0 --> 0:6:50,0
(music- dark drone continues with faint ticking sound)
