SHANE SMITH: I've
been to the most


5
0:0:18,62 --> 0:0:20,97
fucked up place on Earth--


6
0:0:20,97 --> 0:0:21,8
twice.

0:0:21,8 --> 0:0:25,206
The Hermit Kingdom
of North Korea.


8
0:0:25,206 --> 0:0:26,456
(WHISPERING) It's
totally insane.


9
0:0:26,456 --> 0:0:33,75



10
0:0:33,75 --> 0:0:35,44
The thing is, when you
go to North Korea,


11
0:0:35,44 --> 0:0:36,55
you're not a tourist.


12
0:0:36,55 --> 0:0:38,915
You're on a
government-sanctioned tour.


13
0:0:38,915 --> 0:0:41,85
And you can't go anywhere
outside your hotel without


14
0:0:41,85 --> 0:0:45,28
your guide, your translator,
and your secret police.


15
0:0:45,28 --> 0:0:47,61
You're also not allowed
cellphones, radios, or


16
0:0:47,61 --> 0:0:51,12
computers of any kind, and are
taken on a tightly scheduled,


17
0:0:51,12 --> 0:0:52,73
highly orchestrated tour--


18
0:0:52,73 --> 0:0:54,58
only of the sites and
monuments that


19
0:0:54,58 --> 0:0:55,83
they want you to see.


20
0:0:55,83 --> 0:0:58,25



21
0:0:58,25 --> 0:1:2,7
So you end up travelling for
hours and hours on empty roads


22
0:1:2,7 --> 0:1:4,871
only to see the Palace of the
People, or the Library of the


23
0:1:4,871 --> 0:1:6,76
People, or the Soccer
Team of the People.


24
0:1:6,76 --> 0:1:9,39
The only thing you never get to
actually meet is the people


25
0:1:9,39 --> 0:1:10,14
of the people.


26
0:1:10,14 --> 0:1:13,18
In fact, you're not allowed to
talk to anyone unless they're


27
0:1:13,18 --> 0:1:16,709
officially sanctioned
as part of the tour.

29
0:1:22,74 --> 0:1:25,81
So when I heard that North Korea
was actually exporting


30
0:1:25,81 --> 0:1:28,48
its own people as a way to
generate much-needed hard


31
0:1:28,48 --> 0:1:31,13
currency, I wanted to go and see
if I could actually talk


32
0:1:31,13 --> 0:1:33,94
to them and maybe find out what
it's actually like to


33
0:1:33,94 --> 0:1:36,23
live inside the Hermit
Kingdom.


34
0:1:36,23 --> 0:1:41,521



35
0:1:41,521 --> 0:1:44,53
We found out from one of our
correspondents in Russia that


36
0:1:44,53 --> 0:1:47,3
there were actually secret
North Korean labor camps


37
0:1:47,3 --> 0:1:49,3
hidden in the depths
of Siberia.


38
0:1:49,3 --> 0:1:51,9
So we flew to the far eastern
region of Russia and hopped on


39
0:1:51,9 --> 0:1:55,7
the Trans-Siberian railway,
which is essentially the only


40
0:1:55,7 --> 0:1:57,54
lifeline for Siberia and
the Far East region.

We're here in Khabarovsk in
Siberia, we're about to get on


45
0:2:18,93 --> 0:2:20,99
this train for about
28 hours to go to


46
0:2:20,99 --> 0:2:21,85

47
0:2:21,85 --> 0:2:24,27
And we're going to go check out
the secret North Korean


48
0:2:24,27 --> 0:2:27,43
labor camps in Siberia.

We're here with our
friend Simon.


56
0:2:55,78 --> 0:2:57,71
We've been on the train
for a long time.


57
0:2:57,71 --> 0:2:59,42
We're going a bit goofy.


58
0:2:59,42 --> 0:3:0,58
Where are we going?


59

SIMON OSTROVSKY: We're going to
Tynda, in the Amur region


60
0:3:3,56 --> 0:3:7,69
of Russia, in the Far East to
look for the North Koreans.


61
0:3:7,69 --> 0:3:10,64
SHANE SMITH: The thing about
this is, it's mind boggling


62
0:3:10,64 --> 0:3:14,69
that North Korea, the most
hermetic state in the world,


63
0:3:14,69 --> 0:3:17,74
the Hermit Kingdom it's
actually called, is


64
0:3:17,74 --> 0:3:19,96
outsourcing its labor.


65
0:3:19,96 --> 0:3:23,5
But they outsource their labor
into miniature North Korean


66
0:3:23,5 --> 0:3:25,73
villages so that you don't ever
lose the North Korean


67
0:3:25,73 --> 0:3:26,74
experience.


68
0:3:26,74 --> 0:3:29,64
So it's like North Korean-type
buildings, North Korean


69
0:3:29,64 --> 0:3:32,63
propaganda, North Korean
pictures, North Korean songs.


70
0:3:32,63 --> 0:3:34,83
They wake up and sing the
North Korean anthem.


71
0:3:34,83 --> 0:3:36,5
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They bring
North Koreans in for


72
0:3:36,5 --> 0:3:38,13
three-year contracts.


73
0:3:38,13 --> 0:3:40,15
After they're done working here,
they get sent back to


74
0:3:40,15 --> 0:3:40,75
North Korea.


75
0:3:40,75 --> 0:3:43,52
They spend a month in a
reintegration camp to get all


76
0:3:43,52 --> 0:3:45,72
of the propaganda that
they've missed.


77
0:3:45,72 --> 0:3:48,82
Most of the workers are over 40
years old, so they all have


78
0:3:48,82 --> 0:3:50,26
families back home.


79
0:3:50,26 --> 0:3:53,57
So they know that if they try to
run away, then their family


80
0:3:53,57 --> 0:3:54,98
back home gets in trouble.


81
0:3:54,98 --> 0:3:58,23
SHANE SMITH: The North Koreans
are making money to support


82
0:3:58,23 --> 0:3:59,18
the regime.


83

And these poor dudes are out
there in the middle of nowhere


84
0:4:1,74 --> 0:4:5,88

and working in near-slave

of the only place where you


87

how they actually live

SHANE SMITH: Question--


90
0:4:15,67 --> 0:4:17,75
are we going to get assassinated
for going to talk


91
0:4:17,75 --> 0:4:18,85
to the North Koreans?


92
0:4:18,85 --> 0:4:20,459

Quite possibly.

0:4:27,61 --> 0:4:28,44
so long to get to?


98
0:4:28,44 --> 0:4:31,18
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Because all
of the easy-to-get-to ones


99
0:4:31,18 --> 0:4:33,944

better than yours.

105
0:4:44,76 --> 0:4:47,81
Now, you have to remember that
everything in Siberia, almost


106
0:4:47,81 --> 0:4:51,45
without exception, is very,
very fucking far away from


107
0:4:51,45 --> 0:4:52,39
everything else.


108
0:4:52,39 --> 0:4:55,4
And even though it was the
height of summer and 100


109
0:4:55,4 --> 0:4:58,21
degrees outside, because it's
Russia, the heat gauge on the


110
0:4:58,21 --> 0:5:1,22
train had been turned on full
and then broken off--


111
0:5:1,22 --> 0:5:3,63
probably circa 1971.


112
0:5:3,63 --> 0:5:6,42

like being trapped


113
0:5:6,42 --> 0:5:17,95
on a boiling-hot, reeking,
drunken sauna 24 hours a day.
