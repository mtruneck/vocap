1
0:0:0,99 --> 0:0:2,1



2
0:0:2,1 --> 0:0:4,799



3
0:0:4,799 --> 0:0:7,68
Well Jim , we are still gaining a few people but, we're pretty close to 


4
0:0:7,68 --> 0:0:9,659
launch at this stage of the game  


5
0:0:9,659 --> 0:0:14,129
and we will be able to rock and roll here.  


6
0:0:14,129 --> 0:0:17,89
Like at all our Extension meetings, as our gentlemen know that were on our


7
0:0:17,89 --> 0:0:21,269
2009 dairy days, we start on time and end on time.
So, we really


8
0:0:21,269 --> 0:0:25,16
want to respect to your time.
commitments as well.


9
0:0:25,16 --> 0:0:26,89
So, 


10
0:0:26,89 --> 0:0:29,669
we're just about ready to to launch here,
are we not Jim?


11
0:0:29,669 --> 0:0:34,13
According to my watch, I've got about 


12
0:0:34,13 --> 0:0:35,7
a minute to go.  


13
0:0:35,7 --> 0:0:39,49
We had about 150 people indicating 
interest for signing up for it.  


14
0:0:39,49 --> 0:0:43,52
Some locations have more than a couple of
people at a couple of universities had indicated


15
0:0:43,52 --> 0:0:46,59
were never going to pull in and I know of one 
feed company that thinking also


16
0:0:46,59 --> 0:0:50,41
of utilizing the information.


17
0:0:50,41 --> 0:0:56,5
We will see where it goes from there and
our list just keeps keeps getting


18
0:0:56,5 --> 0:0:59,68
longer and that's exciting to see.


19
0:0:59,68 --> 0:1:3,5
Good news Jim! The price is right
and I'll be honest with you, we were kinda


20
0:1:3,5 --> 0:1:6,25
hoping that maybe the webinar is 
method


21
0:1:6,25 --> 0:1:10,159
that we may explore even further here in
the future and that's all you are well


22
0:1:10,159 --> 0:1:14,979
aware of state budgets certainly at Illinois 
and Extension are really really tight and


23
0:1:14,979 --> 0:1:17,23
at some point this may go cost-recovery.


24
0:1:17,23 --> 0:1:20,36
Which means there will be a fee
attached to this and you should be thinking about


25
0:1:20,36 --> 0:1:23,37
that. There will be a survey at the end,
I believe,


26
0:1:23,37 --> 0:1:27,229
that's going to ask the questions.


27
0:1:27,229 --> 0:1:30,829
This time we are not going to ask that
but, the question is do you see value in this


28
0:1:30,829 --> 0:1:33,22
and sometime in the future, maybe
it will be Dave's webinar. 


29
0:1:33,22 --> 0:1:36,86
We will ask if you would
 pay a dollar or would you pay 


30
0:1:36,86 --> 0:1:38,14
five dollars for it


31
0:1:38,14 --> 0:1:41,13
or something like that. At this point
where he's trying to get our feet wet


32
0:1:41,13 --> 0:1:44,59
and and hopefully we don't have too many
glitches today. 


33
0:1:44,59 --> 0:1:48,54
This is our first launch and 
we have our IT group here.
Jim Baltz leads that


34
0:1:48,54 --> 0:1:51,64
group here and there are a 
couple others along with us.


35
0:1:51,64 --> 0:1:57,0
Louann Wilcox and in Jen Roth. 
They're all players in this one as well


36
0:1:57,0 --> 0:2:2,14
and then of course online you'll
hear Dave Fisher bit later and Dick


37
0:2:2,14 --> 0:2:5,259
Wallace. So, they'll be part of this
as a resource people


38
0:2:5,259 --> 0:2:7,789
they have microphones turned out so if 
have a specific health question


39
0:2:7,789 --> 0:2:12,1
Dr. Wallace it would to be very logical if
he first took a 


40
0:2:12,1 --> 0:2:15,39
look at it. If we get some questions in
terms of


41
0:2:15,39 --> 0:2:19,55
forages and facilities and things like that
obviously Dave Fisher would be


42
0:2:19,55 --> 0:2:23,33
a logical choice andof course
you can also type in answers,


43
0:2:23,33 --> 0:2:24,87
questions, and comments


44
0:2:24,87 --> 0:2:26,509
as you go on as well. 


45
0:2:26,509 --> 0:2:30,299
So, I think we ar ready to go. 
Are we not Jim?


46
0:2:30,299 --> 0:2:35,109
We want to welcome everybody to the first
University of Illinois, Dairy webinar!


47
0:2:35,109 --> 0:2:37,4
Co-sponsored with DAIReXNET. 


48
0:2:37,4 --> 0:2:41,12
At this point our topic is feeding
challenges with todays milk prices.


49
0:2:41,12 --> 0:2:44,72
We all know that it's pretty a hot topic at
least here in the United States. I think our


50
0:2:44,72 --> 0:2:46,489
Canadian colleagues have to feel


51
0:2:46,489 --> 0:2:49,719
a little more reassured  but Im not sure
about our colleagues in China


52
0:2:49,719 --> 0:2:50,859
and places like that. 


53
0:2:50,859 --> 0:2:53,849
We have several different countries
represented here today and so hopefully


54
0:2:53,849 --> 0:2:54,59
you will 


55
0:2:54,59 --> 0:2:56,69
find value for that. 


56
0:2:56,69 --> 0:2:58,419
I'll be driving the power points here
today


57
0:2:58,419 --> 0:3:1,72
and as we mentioned earlier we are going
to have a second one


58
0:3:1,72 --> 0:3:4,86
and you'll see this at the end of
the program as well but we thought we'd


59
0:3:4,86 --> 0:3:9,6
just indicate that we'd like to try this
again. You can see the the date, 


60
0:3:9,6 --> 0:3:10,509
the time, and the player


61
0:3:10,509 --> 0:3:14,279
listed up there and there's the
registration URL or if you are


62
0:3:14,279 --> 0:3:15,19
somewhat motivated,


63
0:3:15,19 --> 0:3:18,109
click on that just like you did for
this one here today.


64
0:3:18,109 --> 0:3:21,28
So lets go and get moving on if we can and
I'll get into this.  


65
0:3:21,28 --> 0:3:22,44
and this slides says


66
0:3:22,44 --> 0:3:26,769
"Economic Expectations"
and maybe the worst should be survival.


67
0:3:26,769 --> 0:3:30,999
at this stage of the game. Notice the work profit
doesn't pop up here because most dairymen 


68
0:3:30,999 --> 0:3:34,709
now in the Midwest and the U.S. see no
profit at all. 


69
0:3:34,709 --> 0:3:37,939
The bad news now is that milk prices have dropped 
5 dollars per hundred-weight and in some areas 


70
0:3:37,939 --> 0:3:40,33
ever higher than that because of their


71
0:3:40,33 --> 0:3:41,879
blend prices.  


72
0:3:41,879 --> 0:3:45,879
The good news, feed prices have
also drop somewhat from before


73
0:3:45,879 --> 0:3:46,769
when we were back at 


74
0:3:46,769 --> 0:3:48,58
7 dollar a bushel of corn


75
0:3:48,58 --> 0:3:52,569
and some of these higher feed price. So,
there's a little bit help there as well.


76
0:3:52,569 --> 0:3:56,719
If you're milking a less than about a 
130 cows the MILC program, this is the


77
0:3:56,719 --> 0:3:58,609
milk income lose


78
0:3:58,609 --> 0:4:2,99
program that's done by the
government is now available, you see


79
0:4:2,99 --> 0:4:3,529
that will help us out a little bit. 


80
0:4:3,529 --> 0:4:7,56
The bad news is that we saw this
in fact on the news in Illinois,


81
0:4:7,56 --> 0:4:11,4
if you want to call the good
news, switch about a 100 dollars per


82
0:4:11,4 --> 0:4:13,93
month is what we're looking at kind of a
lose.


83
0:4:13,93 --> 0:4:18,94
The folks out in  New Mexico and
Arizona just last week said the numbers


84
0:4:18,94 --> 0:4:21,779
close to a 150 dollars per
cow per month.


85
0:4:21,779 --> 0:4:25,349
There is some liquidation going on at this
stage of the game.


86
0:4:25,349 --> 0:4:27,679
I'm going to my next power point that
looks at


87
0:4:27,679 --> 0:4:30,97
one of the questions we have a one like,
when might this thing turn around?


88
0:4:30,97 --> 0:4:33,58
Folks, there really is a
pretty good news on that one to be
vey honest. 


89
0:4:33,58 --> 0:4:35,28
Perhaps, I will update that 


90
0:4:35,28 --> 0:4:36,38
for you right now.


91
0:4:36,38 --> 0:4:40,14
The first quarter of these were
the projections, just literally


92
0:4:40,14 --> 0:4:42,32
a week ago, the first quarter


93
0:4:42,32 --> 0:4:46,699
of 2009 this is class 3
milk just be well aware.


94
0:4:46,699 --> 0:4:50,59
We will get into the details on that
but, for us in Illinois we'll probably


95
0:4:50,59 --> 0:4:53,789
put 1 dollar, 1.50 dollar, to maybe 
2 dollars on top of that depending on the


96
0:4:53,789 --> 0:4:58,959
blend price and the differential and
from the quality premiums and milk components.


97
0:4:58,959 --> 0:5:2,23
The second quarter eleven 11.24,
the good news is,


98
0:5:2,23 --> 0:5:5,2
we just found this yesterday the milk 
went up


99
0:5:5,2 --> 0:5:7,349
to its max level.


100
0:5:7,349 --> 0:5:12,32
and those of you who want to go online right now
we now have it in May, June and July.


101
0:5:12,32 --> 0:5:16,77
As of today we're looking at are almost
12.50 to 13.00


102
0:5:16,77 --> 0:5:17,58
dollar milk.


103
0:5:17,58 --> 0:5:21,62
So, the second quarter could be up 1.5 and 
the fourth quarter is all


104
0:5:21,62 --> 0:5:25,9
over 16.


105
0:5:25,9 --> 0:5:29,27
So, that's kind of exciting news at
this point and along with 16,000


106
0:5:29,27 --> 0:5:33,629
cows that left the dairy industry
here in February. 


107
0:5:33,629 --> 0:5:37,509
Certainly, things are happening out there
on the farm.


108
0:5:37,509 --> 0:5:41,56
We did mention briefly as we talked
about surviving in these times,


109
0:5:41,56 --> 0:5:44,73
again in the U.S. this is your
deficiency payments. 


110
0:5:44,73 --> 0:5:48,619
Again, you know it only counts for your first
2.9 million pounds of milk


111
0:5:48,619 --> 0:5:51,889
but, in the February price it was 1.63


112
0:5:51,889 --> 0:5:56,34
If we look forward that prices
almost going to be at 2 dollars in March.


113
0:5:56,34 --> 0:5:59,5
At least projections if you 
look at what's ahead


114
0:5:59,5 --> 0:6:1,29
that's what the tables are showing,


115
0:6:1,29 --> 0:6:5,8
1.93 in March a 1.60
in April.


116
0:6:5,8 --> 0:6:9,82
So anyway, that's
another factor that'll come into play


117
0:6:9,82 --> 0:6:12,57
and certainly you know if 
you're doing a farmer here you


118
0:6:12,57 --> 0:6:16,43
usually want to be aware of this program,
regardless of your herd size because it looks


119
0:6:16,43 --> 0:6:17,89
like that the next 2 or 3 months.


120
0:6:17,89 --> 0:6:21,0
What's the good news on this chart? 
It looks like in September


121
0:6:21,0 --> 0:6:23,449
numbers get very low which means


122
0:6:23,449 --> 0:6:25,53
the price of milk is coming up. 


123
0:6:25,53 --> 0:6:28,229
Well what are we going to talk about then? I
thought we just set the stage a little bit 


124
0:6:28,229 --> 0:6:30,75
to get an idea about where the prices are,


125
0:6:30,75 --> 0:6:33,629
when they might change, what are some of
the strategies,


126
0:6:33,629 --> 0:6:37,289
and of course being one of the question
we would all like an answer from the three


127
0:6:37,289 --> 0:6:41,189
of us is: where can i find
that 5 dollars per hundred-weight?


128
0:6:41,189 --> 0:6:44,259
More specifically: what changes
can i make


129
0:6:44,259 --> 0:6:47,909
to save 5 dollars per hundred-weight?
Unfortunately, there is one right answer


130
0:6:47,909 --> 0:6:50,759
there Jim, the answer is don't feed your cows. 


131
0:6:50,759 --> 0:6:54,409
If you don't feed your cows you will
save about 5 dollars 


132
0:6:54,409 --> 0:6:55,39
per hundred-weight. 


133
0:6:55,39 --> 0:6:58,469
I think there is some negative downside to
that but at least they're sure academic


134
0:6:58,469 --> 0:6:59,74
answer you have.


135
0:6:59,74 --> 0:7:3,75
So, what I'm going to go through our these
three points: feed benchmarking, the


136
0:7:3,75 --> 0:7:8,61
three golden rules, and then
alternatives. Dave and Dick will come in


137
0:7:8,61 --> 0:7:11,629
and be players in that part of the
program as well.


138
0:7:11,629 --> 0:7:14,1
Let's start going through what I call


139
0:7:14,1 --> 0:7:15,37
feed benchmarking.


140
0:7:15,37 --> 0:7:19,96
I put this up the same this to say from
Illinois dairy days back in January


141
0:7:19,96 --> 0:7:24,37
and some focus meetings in February
in Illinois. Farmers are making


142
0:7:24,37 --> 0:7:25,249
decision.


143
0:7:25,249 --> 0:7:29,259
Bankers are forcing farmers to make
decisions. Farmers are asking nutritious


144
0:7:29,259 --> 0:7:31,659
and veterinarians to make changes
well.


145
0:7:31,659 --> 0:7:33,11
All these are pretty scary,


146
0:7:33,11 --> 0:7:34,64
all these have been told,


147
0:7:34,64 --> 0:7:38,56
and the one that really scares me is two
bankers have told their people


148
0:7:38,56 --> 0:7:41,6
you'll feed only what's on the farm.
Which means


149
0:7:41,6 --> 0:7:41,8
corn


150
0:7:41,8 --> 0:7:43,24
and forages.


151
0:7:43,24 --> 0:7:46,749
That has some serious ramifications
as well.


152
0:7:46,749 --> 0:7:49,61
Let's go look at this economic
benchmark. 


153
0:7:49,61 --> 0:7:53,77
We will go through this modestly fast but,
every dairy farmer, every consultant,


154
0:7:53,77 --> 0:7:56,19
every individual


155
0:7:56,19 --> 0:7:58,729
has this type of a budget.


156
0:7:58,729 --> 0:8:1,52
This is illinois, we will be very clear at
times that 


157
0:8:1,52 --> 0:8:3,759
the data is very biased and


158
0:8:3,759 --> 0:8:8,239
specifically laid out but, this says
pretty much today what is the cost but


159
0:8:8,239 --> 0:8:10,139
groceries in front of our girls.


160
0:8:10,139 --> 0:8:13,77
You can see we have broken down into
six different categories. I go right up


161
0:8:13,77 --> 0:8:16,319
and say I'm going to pay someone
10 cents a cow


162
0:8:16,319 --> 0:8:19,44
to do that do the work. 
That may include balance rations,


163
0:8:19,44 --> 0:8:21,76
interpreting test results,


164
0:8:21,76 --> 0:8:24,309
maybe spotting good feed buys, and things
like that.


165
0:8:24,309 --> 0:8:27,789
Here you can see here that magic
50 pounds of dry matter


166
0:8:27,789 --> 0:8:30,869
that is costing 4.44. 


167
0:8:30,869 --> 0:8:34,9
Now, let's go to the next  one and this
is the one you want to circle


168
0:8:34,9 --> 0:8:36,419
or go back to or write down quickly.


169
0:8:36,419 --> 0:8:38,219
Here's is where you are going to get
your grades.  


170
0:8:38,219 --> 0:8:41,159
See that top number? There is 
your 4.44. 


171
0:8:41,159 --> 0:8:43,59
It then generates these next four 
benchmarks.


172
0:8:43,59 --> 0:8:48,0
The first one is feed cost per pound of dry
matter and that is .09 cents. If you can feed cows


173
0:8:48,0 --> 0:8:51,61
for .09 per pound of dry matter
here in the Midwest but


174
0:8:51,61 --> 0:8:56,46
when I was in Arizona about a
month ago that is .02 cents higher.  


175
0:8:56,46 --> 0:8:58,79
.02 cents of dry matter per pound higher.


176
0:8:58,79 --> 0:9:2,69
Well those folks are now
looking at another extra dollar in their


177
0:9:2,69 --> 0:9:7,13
feed cost but, luckily we hear in Illinois,
Wisconsin, and Iowa don't face that 


178
0:9:7,13 --> 0:9:7,93
as far as that goes.


179
0:9:7,93 --> 0:9:10,24
So, .09 cents becomes a aid. 


180
0:9:10,24 --> 0:9:13,95
Feed cost per hundred-weight of milk notice
that sits somewhere around 6 to


181
0:9:13,95 --> 0:9:16,22
6.50 to 7 dollars.


182
0:9:16,22 --> 0:9:17,81
What do you have to see?


183
0:9:17,81 --> 0:9:22,36
You have to see those cows that
produce more milk in the same feed stuff


184
0:9:22,36 --> 0:9:27,51
produces cheaper. So, anytime you start
messing with milk yield then be well


185
0:9:27,51 --> 0:9:28,779
aware you're gonna start


186
0:9:28,779 --> 0:9:32,9
playing the game of losing some of these
benchmark numbers.


187
0:9:32,9 --> 0:9:35,899
I'm saying if you can't feed your
cows 6.50 per hundred-weight here in the 


188
0:9:35,899 --> 0:9:37,889
Midwest you're doing a very nice job.


189
0:9:37,889 --> 0:9:42,38
If you get it down below 6 dollars
more power to you. 


190
0:9:42,38 --> 0:9:43,91
Income over feed cost


191
0:9:43,91 --> 0:9:46,109
actually gets outdated everyday 


192
0:9:46,109 --> 0:9:49,14
and some people love
this figure.


193
0:9:49,14 --> 0:9:53,24
I don't use it very much because I can't
control the price of


194
0:9:53,24 --> 0:9:54,4
my milk. 


195
0:9:54,4 --> 0:9:57,76
That drives this number. I mean a
year ago this number looked a lot


196
0:9:57,76 --> 0:10:1,569
better and you as a producer had nothing
to impact. 


197
0:10:1,569 --> 0:10:5,749
You do impact feed cost per amount of dry matter,
feed cost per weight of milk, and the last


198
0:10:5,749 --> 0:10:7,3
one feed efficiency.


199
0:10:7,3 --> 0:10:9,46
This one is getting lots traction
now.


200
0:10:9,46 --> 0:10:12,89
Feed efficiency and suddenly dairy farmers
are interested.


201
0:10:12,89 --> 0:10:16,14
Consultants are interested saying, maybe
that's important to know how much milk


202
0:10:16,14 --> 0:10:17,91
do I get from each pound of dry matter.  


203
0:10:17,91 --> 0:10:18,739
Your aim


204
0:10:18,739 --> 0:10:19,82
is 1.5.


205
0:10:19,82 --> 0:10:22,6
If you get your feed efficiency over 
1.5


206
0:10:22,6 --> 0:10:26,55
you're doing an awfully good job. You are doing a
really job.


207
0:10:26,55 --> 0:10:27,96
Why is that important?


208
0:10:27,96 --> 0:10:30,299
All I did was take a cow, 


209
0:10:30,299 --> 0:10:31,649
a herd,


210
0:10:31,649 --> 0:10:34,859
a string of cows producing
70 pounds of milk


211
0:10:34,859 --> 0:10:36,65
at .09 cents a pounds of dry matter. 


212
0:10:36,65 --> 0:10:40,35
If I can support that 70 pounds
of milk with 50 pounds of dry matter


213
0:10:40,35 --> 0:10:46,8
versus 44 pounds of dry matter
that's a savings of .56 cents
a cow per day.


214
0:10:46,8 --> 0:10:49,579
A huge number, that's a huge number.


215
0:10:49,579 --> 0:10:54,68
I would argue if you are in a room and
lectured with me in class or 


216
0:10:54,68 --> 0:10:55,89
at a conference


217
0:10:55,89 --> 0:10:58,37
all of us should be able to find
.50 cents a day 


218
0:10:58,37 --> 0:11:1,879
and if after this seminar is over and you 
have not found .50 cents


219
0:11:1,879 --> 0:11:5,48
then Dave Fisher, Dick Wallace, and
Mike Hutjens haven't done a very good job.


220
0:11:5,48 --> 0:11:8,6
bIwould argue all of you should
be able to get some worth


221
0:11:8,6 --> 0:11:11,859
between 1.5 and 1.6
by doing some rather interesting


222
0:11:11,859 --> 0:11:13,37
strategic thing


223
0:11:13,37 --> 0:11:15,23
that we will touch on here very briefly.


224
0:11:15,23 --> 0:11:19,4
So, that's a powerful power point where
feed efficiency is this critical,


225
0:11:19,4 --> 0:11:20,64
critical number.


226
0:11:20,64 --> 0:11:24,27
Now, if you don't think it varies, it is 
a very busy slide, in fact  Jim Anders put


227
0:11:24,27 --> 0:11:25,52
this slide together.


228
0:11:25,52 --> 0:11:29,36
I just shows about 67
different farms here in Illinois collected


229
0:11:29,36 --> 0:11:30,539
in January


230
0:11:30,539 --> 0:11:31,939
of 2009.  


231
0:11:31,939 --> 0:11:33,839
Guys and gals these are pretty good farms.


232
0:11:33,839 --> 0:11:37,57
Notice the yellow number that's
the low ball number and


233
0:11:37,57 --> 0:11:39,49
the blue number is the high number.


234
0:11:39,49 --> 0:11:43,39
Just look at the differences 
on the bottom 3 numbers


235
0:11:43,39 --> 0:11:47,489
on feed cost. We see some herds here 
on feed costs getting down 


236
0:11:47,489 --> 0:11:51,699
as low as 1.41 so, that's 
a high group TMR.


237
0:11:51,699 --> 0:11:54,98
Now notice that is also the most
expensive cost of pound per dry matter. 


238
0:11:54,98 --> 0:11:56,75
Don't you miss that!


239
0:11:56,75 --> 0:11:58,34
In other words, this dairyman
has gotten a 


240
0:11:58,34 --> 0:12:0,119
very good ration put together


241
0:12:0,119 --> 0:12:3,28
very expensive ratio. His cows
understand that


242
0:12:3,28 --> 0:12:7,43
and so they respond very well. 
There's a low group versus a high group. 


243
0:12:7,43 --> 0:12:10,149
We will touch on that very briefly
and remember this slide. 


244
0:12:10,149 --> 0:12:11,51
Look at this slide over here 
on feed efficiency. 


245
0:12:11,51 --> 0:12:13,97
One of my herds is 1.4, 


246
0:12:13,97 --> 0:12:18,17
most of my herds are sitting around 
1.51-1.61. 


247
0:12:18,17 --> 0:12:22,54
This shows us, all of these herds are in
Illinois, that in most cases almost are literally


248
0:12:22,54 --> 0:12:23,61
within a 20 


249
0:12:23,61 --> 0:12:26,6
to 30 mile radius of where our meeting 
was being held


250
0:12:26,6 --> 0:12:30,23
over at Freeport. So it is 
some amazing data. 


251
0:12:30,23 --> 0:12:33,5
So, let's look at the bottom line as we
finish up here


252
0:12:33,5 --> 0:12:36,41
and this comes from Bruce Jones,
Doctor Bruce Jones, at the University of


253
0:12:36,41 --> 0:12:40,13
Wisconsin Madison and this came out of
one of its publication several months


254
0:12:40,13 --> 0:12:40,91
ago he said


255
0:12:40,91 --> 0:12:42,69
here are 3 of the big items.


256
0:12:42,69 --> 0:12:45,31
He's got feed cost in a range.


257
0:12:45,31 --> 0:12:48,17
most of my Illinois guys are 
going to be on the right side.


258
0:12:48,17 --> 0:12:51,799
I've got an Illinois herd, probably going 
to be the left side, he's milking


259
0:12:51,799 --> 0:12:55,19
either 1,200 or 3,000
cows so,  certainly


260
0:12:55,19 --> 0:12:57,32
it makes a difference. Feed cost,


261
0:12:57,32 --> 0:12:58,7
non-feed cost, 


262
0:12:58,7 --> 0:13:0,509
labor costs, in fact Dave Fisher


263
0:13:0,509 --> 0:13:4,739
and a colleague down in 
his area other, work with these numbers and


264
0:13:4,739 --> 0:13:8,5
they come out almost identically coming
at a little different direction.  


265
0:13:8,5 --> 0:13:10,399
The point simply is that notice that top-line:


266
0:13:10,399 --> 0:13:11,67
no debt payment,


267
0:13:11,67 --> 0:13:15,619
no return on assets, no return management
skills or salary


268
0:13:15,619 --> 0:13:19,19
but, simply says we probably need 
in Illinois somewhere between 


269
0:13:19,19 --> 0:13:19,84
15.50 for milk


270
0:13:19,84 --> 0:13:21,19
to cover everything


271
0:13:21,19 --> 0:13:23,85
You can see some of the other farms
can get around


272
0:13:23,85 --> 0:13:27,64
11:50 to 12 dollars because they can 
survive at least covering these costs


273
0:13:27,64 --> 0:13:28,74
as well.


274
0:13:28,74 --> 0:13:31,6
So, that's another question that has been
raised by some of our students and that is


275
0:13:31,6 --> 0:13:34,299
well where do we have to be to cover
costs?


276
0:13:34,299 --> 0:13:38,359
That's why I'm pretty excited this morning
to see that actually you could lock in


277
0:13:38,359 --> 0:13:39,8
16 dollar milk


278
0:13:39,8 --> 0:13:42,9
for the last three months of


279
0:13:42,9 --> 0:13:43,369
of of this year


280
0:13:43,369 --> 0:13:46,999
and of course you can actually contract
your milk. Now question is are you going to do


281
0:13:46,999 --> 0:13:47,67
that?


282
0:13:47,67 --> 0:13:49,99
That's another question for
another story and


283
0:13:49,99 --> 0:13:52,24
we can do that for a Q&A. 


284
0:13:52,24 --> 0:13:55,41
Okay, that part care of takes
care of the first third of the


285
0:13:55,41 --> 0:13:56,41
presentation.


286
0:13:56,41 --> 0:13:59,95
Something what I call benchmarks numbers
comparisons


287
0:13:59,95 --> 0:14:4,46
how competitive are you, what do you
have to have and where is your profit margin


288
0:14:4,46 --> 0:14:6,4
going to start to occur?


289
0:14:6,4 --> 0:14:9,97
I'm not going to my second part and every
time you see these jersey cows


290
0:14:9,97 --> 0:14:12,509
it simply says were changing a topic


291
0:14:12,509 --> 0:14:17,239
or an emphasis to try to keep you with me
as we go through the webinar. 


292
0:14:17,239 --> 0:14:18,55
Webinars are deadly and


293
0:14:18,55 --> 0:14:19,39
they can be really tough


294
0:14:19,39 --> 0:14:22,259
because there's no way to see
faces


295
0:14:22,259 --> 0:14:25,67
and see what people are saying like what is this
guy talking about?!


296
0:14:25,67 --> 0:14:29,819
So, let's go to through these golden rules
and we'll go through them modestly
fast.  If you read


297
0:14:29,819 --> 0:14:32,22
a couple of farm magazines these have
been picked up


298
0:14:32,22 --> 0:14:35,62
a couple of different sources. These
are golden rules that simply state


299
0:14:35,62 --> 0:14:36,509
number one:


300
0:14:36,509 --> 0:14:38,14
I'd never give up milk 


301
0:14:38,14 --> 0:14:40,69
and if you are a banker get
your ears on.  


302
0:14:40,69 --> 0:14:43,7
If you're a consultant get your ears on.


303
0:14:43,7 --> 0:14:45,879
If you're dairy farmer having a hard time
paying bills


304
0:14:45,879 --> 0:14:47,97
you've just gotta live with
that.


305
0:14:47,97 --> 0:14:52,37
The reason is that I bring up
this point now a useful guideline and


306
0:14:52,37 --> 0:14:55,44
it simply says if we look at dry
matter, that means


307
0:14:55,44 --> 0:14:56,959
grocery that feed the cow,


308
0:14:56,959 --> 0:15:0,91
versus what she produces in milk sales.
The thumb for for Jersey's is 


309
0:15:0,91 --> 0:15:3,24
2 pounds of milk per pound of dry matter. 


310
0:15:3,24 --> 0:15:6,37
Actually Holstein's is about 2.5 
but let's just say to because it's easy


311
0:15:6,37 --> 0:15:7,15
to see. 


312
0:15:7,15 --> 0:15:11,8
So, most dairy cows should give you 
that extra pound of dry matter


313
0:15:11,8 --> 0:15:15,73
or that pound of dry matter you takeaway
that's going to cost you 2 pounds milk. 


314
0:15:15,73 --> 0:15:18,42
So, if milk is sitting at 12 dollars 


315
0:15:18,42 --> 0:15:21,97
and we're looking at 2to 1 ratio it
simply says I'm going to put .09 cents


316
0:15:21,97 --> 0:15:26,329
in front of my Jersey cow, it says I 
would be getting .24 cents back


317
0:15:26,329 --> 0:15:28,23
or .30cents back. 


318
0:15:28,23 --> 0:15:30,91
I'm simply saying that's an offly  
nice trade. 


319
0:15:30,91 --> 0:15:34,959
That's awfully good trade. I have to
be very, very, very careful


320
0:15:34,959 --> 0:15:39,809
when I start pulling back because that's going
to mess with milk yield and milk performance


321
0:15:39,809 --> 0:15:44,39
as far as that goes. Now the next line simply says
yes let's do some shopping!


322
0:15:44,39 --> 0:15:46,76
Here are 3 different energy sources


323
0:15:46,76 --> 0:15:50,67
and will be calculated out with the cost
per Mcal of energy. 


324
0:15:50,67 --> 0:15:55,2
It could be a pound of TVM 
whichever numbers you like to work with.


325
0:15:55,2 --> 0:15:55,85
If you are in 


326
0:15:55,85 --> 0:16:0,34
France it would be 
metabolizable energy, it depends


327
0:16:0,34 --> 0:16:1,44
on what country you are in


328
0:16:1,44 --> 0:16:3,97
and what system you are working with but 
at the point it is very simple.


329
0:16:3,97 --> 0:16:8,36
You can see those numbers and the answer
is the cheapest source of energy


330
0:16:8,36 --> 0:16:13,36
on these feeds would be corn silage. Now,
recently there's a new winner in Illinois and


331
0:16:13,36 --> 0:16:15,48
its called wet gluten feed. 


332
0:16:15,48 --> 0:16:17,119
We're seeing prices


333
0:16:17,119 --> 0:16:20,98
of gluten feed somewhere around
60 dollars a ton


334
0:16:20,98 --> 0:16:26,3
and gluten feed is a tremendously,
tremendously good energy source.


335
0:16:26,3 --> 0:16:28,86
So, yes I would say don't cut back and
energies.


336
0:16:28,86 --> 0:16:32,56
The question is are you buying the best
economical source of energy. The same thing 


337
0:16:32,56 --> 0:16:35,86
would apply to forages, applied to
protein supplements, and apply to 


338
0:16:35,86 --> 0:16:37,14
byproduct feeds.


339
0:16:37,14 --> 0:16:38,23
The question is 


340
0:16:38,23 --> 0:16:40,38
don't cut down on nutrients but are you getting


341
0:16:40,38 --> 0:16:43,77
the best bang for your dollar. 


342
0:16:43,77 --> 0:16:45,109
Golden Rule number 2


343
0:16:45,109 --> 0:16:48,1
follows the rule number one and it 
simply says 


344
0:16:48,1 --> 0:16:51,9
that most of us, unless you're living in
Florida or Georgia or some of those 


345
0:16:51,9 --> 0:16:55,73
other milk markets, we are paid on pounds of
components.


346
0:16:55,73 --> 0:16:59,829
This is a fairly sobering and you'll notice
that just about a year ago


347
0:16:59,829 --> 0:17:9,22
at this time, by the way that's 2009,


348
0:17:9,22 --> 0:17:14,65
milk fat was, thats the last numbers i
have since the March numbers aren't out,


349
0:17:14,65 --> 0:17:16,39
a 1.09 for milk bath


350
0:17:16,39 --> 0:17:23,209
and that should be 1.92.


351
0:17:23,209 --> 0:17:28,6
That protein prices should be at 1.92,
a 1.92 out side of that it looks


352
0:17:28,6 --> 0:17:32,48
really good. Of course that milk price
is around 12 dollars outside of


353
0:17:32,48 --> 0:17:35,929
that all those numbers look pretty good.
I just want make sure people are top of things


354
0:17:35,929 --> 0:17:39,73
here.
 
0:17:36.790,0:17:39.730
The point that was simply is that
milk 


355
0:17:39,73 --> 0:17:41,27
components have value


356
0:17:41,27 --> 0:17:44,77
and that's another number to take a look.
So rather than dwell on these 


357
0:17:44,77 --> 0:17:46,9
wonderful numbers,


358
0:17:46,9 --> 0:17:49,94
James is rapidly making corrections here,
let's look at and simply say well are


359
0:17:49,94 --> 0:17:54,7
you getting your cows to get their
genetic potential out of them?


360
0:17:54,7 --> 0:17:58,59
This comes out Hoards Dairyman every year
they put their DHIR and these are


361
0:17:58,59 --> 0:17:59,7
the


362
0:17:59,7 --> 0:18:2,2
basically registered breeders


363
0:18:2,2 --> 0:18:6,99
here in United States. They get 
these rather exact high-tech


364
0:18:6,99 --> 0:18:7,94
records


365
0:18:7,94 --> 0:18:11,97
and basically what it says that if I
have Holstein cows in the United States


366
0:18:11,97 --> 0:18:16,71
these cows on DHIR tests in the United
States average about a


367
0:18:16,71 --> 0:18:17,519
3.6 to 3.7 


368
0:18:17,519 --> 0:18:20,17
The true protein, those of you who
are in Canada,


369
0:18:20,17 --> 0:18:22,23
you've gotta put 2/10ths on top of
that,


370
0:18:22,23 --> 0:18:26,529
most of you in China have to put 2/10ths 
on top of it and in Europe you have 
to add 2/10ths to that 


371
0:18:26,529 --> 0:18:28,38
because what we're reporting the U.S.


372
0:18:28,38 --> 0:18:30,0
is true protein 


373
0:18:30,0 --> 0:18:32,2
because that's what drives cheese yield. 


374
0:18:32,2 --> 0:18:34,29
So, we're not paying you for NPN


375
0:18:34,29 --> 0:18:37,919
and that's why I'd be a little bit careful 
to who don't live in the U.S.


376
0:18:37,919 --> 0:18:42,109
your numbers are going to be put at 2/10ths
point higher we have on the screen here.


377
0:18:42,109 --> 0:18:46,479
The point is that if I have Holstein cows
and they're giving me a 2.8 


378
0:18:46,479 --> 0:18:47,75
true protein test


379
0:18:47,75 --> 0:18:50,33
than we would ask you to leave some money
on the table. 


380
0:18:50,33 --> 0:18:55,28
Why are your Holstein cows not 
producing components? Because we 
just saw on the last slide


381
0:18:55,28 --> 0:18:57,8
those components have value


382
0:18:57,8 --> 0:19:0,82
and we've got to get those corrected
out there as well.


383
0:19:0,82 --> 0:19:3,37
The third golden rule is one that really
scares me.


384
0:19:3,37 --> 0:19:5,1
Of all the ones I have seen,


385
0:19:5,1 --> 0:19:8,45
this is the one that's causing me the
most concern 


386
0:19:8,45 --> 0:19:10,53
and that is long-term. 


387
0:19:10,53 --> 0:19:14,74
Long-term make people say well you know
I've gotta get July.


388
0:19:14,74 --> 0:19:18,42
So, I'm not going to use AI, I'm not
going to use my consultant, and I'm not


389
0:19:18,42 --> 0:19:22,86
going to use the the veterinarian. Let's go to
the nutrition side and simply says


390
0:19:22,86 --> 0:19:25,89
your long-term if you're going to be out
of the dairy business in


391
0:19:25,89 --> 0:19:26,929
2 to 3 months then


392
0:19:26,929 --> 0:19:28,48
you can do anything you want


393
0:19:28,48 --> 0:19:31,61
but, if you're going to back it a webinar
year from now with us


394
0:19:31,61 --> 0:19:35,71
than I'm simply saying certainly we've got to
get animals calving.


395
0:19:35,71 --> 0:19:38,9
So when we start pulling out minerals 
and vitamins from the heifers 


396
0:19:38,9 --> 0:19:40,32
we are going to slow down in growth


397
0:19:40,32 --> 0:19:43,62
and you can see what that cost is. Now the
good news is


398
0:19:43,62 --> 0:19:46,139
you don't pay that all your checkbook
but, the problem is


399
0:19:46,139 --> 0:19:49,559
2 years from now those heifers
are not going to be there. 


400
0:19:49,559 --> 0:19:51,159
Accelerated calf program


401
0:19:51,159 --> 0:19:55,13
have some controversy on this point but, the
Drackley work and  the New York work


402
0:19:55,13 --> 0:19:57,48
indicate about 1,000 pounds more milk 


403
0:19:57,48 --> 0:20:0,609
because of the accelerated high-protein
diets feed 


404
0:20:0,609 --> 0:20:4,49
in the first 5 or 6 weeks. That's
going to cost you 50 dollars and


405
0:20:4,49 --> 0:20:8,109
that is you're problem. 
I'm going to have to pay 50 dollars in March


406
0:20:8,109 --> 0:20:12,929
to recoup something from way back 2 years
from now that may give me a 1,000


407
0:20:12,929 --> 0:20:14,72
pounds more milk that's to be worth


408
0:20:14,72 --> 0:20:18,83
a 110 dollars or to make
more life simple hopefully even


409
0:20:18,83 --> 0:20:21,78
more than that. Dave Fisher will talk
more about this


410
0:20:21,78 --> 0:20:24,78
in his webinar in a couple of weeks,  


411
0:20:24,78 --> 0:20:27,62
Getting cows pregnant, this is in Wisconsin
that


412
0:20:27,62 --> 0:20:31,27
open days are anything more than 120
days or 2 dollars a day


413
0:20:31,27 --> 0:20:35,1
they say are over 200 days 
that is 8 dollars 


414
0:20:35,1 --> 0:20:38,31
So, there is a curvilinear response
that says the longer these cows


415
0:20:38,31 --> 0:20:39,62
are not pregnant


416
0:20:39,62 --> 0:20:42,84
the more money you lose because
they don't come in as fresh cows.  


417
0:20:42,84 --> 0:20:44,789
Wisconsin's somatic cell count


418
0:20:44,789 --> 0:20:48,35
and of course from California lame cows.
So, if you are not hoof trimming or


419
0:20:48,35 --> 0:20:49,71
you are not paying attention to


420
0:20:49,71 --> 0:20:50,85
those kinds of things,


421
0:20:50,85 --> 0:20:54,789
another 6 pounds of milk again you 
never see that running down the


422
0:20:54,789 --> 0:20:58,149
milking parlor it is just that the
cow


423
0:20:58,149 --> 0:20:59,25
doesn't produce.


424
0:20:59,25 --> 0:21:3,27
These are scary ones because 
people are


425
0:21:3,27 --> 0:21:6,659
really jeopardizing long-term impactors.  


426
0:21:6,659 --> 0:21:11,19
So, the point is if you make a change
today or last week or last month


427
0:21:11,19 --> 0:21:15,16
than the cows are going to respond 
these are all different types of cow


428
0:21:15,16 --> 0:21:19,45
responses that you and I might see out
there. Milk Urea Nitrogen,


429
0:21:19,45 --> 0:21:22,72
if it changes by more than 3 units,
I will read the first one


430
0:21:22,72 --> 0:21:26,86
the rest can read yourself but, it simply
says if your MUNS has changed by 


431
0:21:26,86 --> 0:21:28,21
2 to 3 units. 


432
0:21:28,21 --> 0:21:30,17
than something has happened in the cow. 


433
0:21:30,17 --> 0:21:34,66
So, in the normal range I expect to see the
MUN to be somewhere between 8 and 12. 


434
0:21:34,66 --> 0:21:40,169
So, you elect to pull out something out of 
your diet and the MUNs go up to 14.


435
0:21:40,169 --> 0:21:41,529
Wow, something has happened


436
0:21:41,529 --> 0:21:45,3
in the cow in other words, the cows are telling
you whatever you did


437
0:21:45,3 --> 0:21:47,79
it has impacted 


438
0:21:47,79 --> 0:21:49,6
her utilization of protein


439
0:21:49,6 --> 0:21:50,55
in the diet. 


440
0:21:50,55 --> 0:21:54,64
That applies to all those other
factors listed on your screen here today


441
0:21:54,64 --> 0:21:57,529
as well and we in fact already covered
the bottom 3. 


442
0:21:57,529 --> 0:21:59,279
in some other golden rule.


443
0:21:59,279 --> 0:22:2,129
Cows always talk and cows responds.


444
0:22:2,129 --> 0:22:5,48
Keep your eyes wide open and listen to them
because they will probably give you


445
0:22:5,48 --> 0:22:8,22
some feedback as well.


446
0:22:8,22 --> 0:22:13,2
Now we are moving on to the last page
and we are in  pretty good shape time wise actually


447
0:22:13,2 --> 0:22:16,37
of the last phase of this. What are
some things that we should be thinking


448
0:22:16,37 --> 0:22:17,12
about


449
0:22:17,12 --> 0:22:21,33
and talking about once we have said I'm not
going to violate the golden rules. 


450
0:22:21,33 --> 0:22:25,34
I understand there are some economic benchmarks
on the feed side that we have to be aware of.


451
0:22:25,34 --> 0:22:29,22
I understand the price of milk, at least in
the U.S., looks like it's coming back up


452
0:22:29,22 --> 0:22:32,5
which it is for this Friday at this
stage of the game. 


453
0:22:32,5 --> 0:22:35,179
What are some things we can look at the
that we can cheat?


454
0:22:35,179 --> 0:22:39,12
I'm going to cheat it's been a
really tough 2 months


455
0:22:39,12 --> 0:22:40,899
for those of us in extension because


456
0:22:40,899 --> 0:22:44,65
farmers are saying "Mike, I
just can't pay the bills anymore.


457
0:22:44,65 --> 0:22:47,69
I've got have got to make some adjustments."


458
0:22:47,69 --> 0:22:51,59
Here we go, we are going to let you do some cheating 
but be careful to not violate my golden rules!


459
0:22:51,59 --> 0:22:52,88
We are going to look at starch.


460
0:22:52,88 --> 0:22:56,639
and we've got one power point on most of
these and Dave will come back on forage


461
0:22:56,639 --> 0:22:58,7
quality a bit later. 


462
0:22:58,7 --> 0:23:2,45
We learned some lessons a year ago
with 7 dollar a bushel of corn. 


463
0:23:2,45 --> 0:23:5,34
We discovered we don't have to feed
30 percent starches because 
there are some other


464
0:23:5,34 --> 0:23:6,63
strategies out there


465
0:23:6,63 --> 0:23:7,66
as listed here.


466
0:23:7,66 --> 0:23:10,63
Rumensin, reducing fecal
starch losses,


467
0:23:10,63 --> 0:23:14,42
looking at rumen fermentable 
carbohydrates and byproduct feeds.


468
0:23:14,42 --> 0:23:17,87
So, we are saying all of you with this line
should know it pretty much what is your


469
0:23:17,87 --> 0:23:20,14
starch levels in your feeding programs.


470
0:23:20,14 --> 0:23:22,89
The low number 19 comes from a
minor institute


471
0:23:22,89 --> 0:23:24,74
and they've actually


472
0:23:24,74 --> 0:23:28,68
cranked this number down but using higher
levels of corn silage and other unique feed stuffs


473
0:23:28,68 --> 0:23:30,7
to get that job done. 


474
0:23:30,7 --> 0:23:33,8
We are saying you don't need to be at
30, 31, 32, or 33 percent starch.


475
0:23:33,8 --> 0:23:37,2
So, maybe there's an
opportunity to reduce some of that input


476
0:23:37,2 --> 0:23:39,23
cost as far as that goes.


477
0:23:39,23 --> 0:23:43,27
Let's go to the next power point
and then say well is corn really working for


478
0:23:43,27 --> 0:23:44,27
you?


479
0:23:44,27 --> 0:23:47,58
This data simply says how you've
processed corn


480
0:23:47,58 --> 0:23:51,909
and i know we have one company online
here today that has steam flaked corn. 


481
0:23:51,909 --> 0:23:54,87
You can see that has a higher energy
value


482
0:23:54,87 --> 0:23:56,96
than say a cracked corn.


483
0:23:56,96 --> 0:23:59,55
Some of you online have high moisture corn


484
0:23:59,55 --> 0:24:0,75
and that will feed


485
0:24:0,75 --> 0:24:4,99
hotter than dried corn assuming that it is at
least 26 percent


486
0:24:4,99 --> 0:24:6,9
moisture. 


487
0:24:6,9 --> 0:24:9,209
So, you can see in orange, that
was because Illinois won their 


488
0:24:9,209 --> 0:24:10,999
basketball game last night and


489
0:24:10,999 --> 0:24:14,11
they did not. So, Jim I think we 
should have put it all in black today


490
0:24:14,11 --> 0:24:14,98
but anyway


491
0:24:14,98 --> 0:24:16,0
it will help you read. 


492
0:24:16,0 --> 0:24:19,24
But the point simply says is that
corn 


493
0:24:19,24 --> 0:24:21,83
how you process it, how you handle it


494
0:24:21,83 --> 0:24:25,37
how you make it makes real
difference. Now for a dairy farmer if you


495
0:24:25,37 --> 0:24:27,0
look at some work from Penn State


496
0:24:27,0 --> 0:24:28,679
and from Farmland Industries


497
0:24:28,679 --> 0:24:32,51
the difference between the top corn and
the bottom corn in a mid-lactation cows


498
0:24:32,51 --> 0:24:33,97
is 6 pounds 


499
0:24:33,97 --> 0:24:35,54
of milk.


500
0:24:35,54 --> 0:24:40,7
So I can support 6 pounds more
milk because you and I have processed


501
0:24:40,7 --> 0:24:41,309
corn 


502
0:24:41,309 --> 0:24:43,51
to make the starch more available


503
0:24:43,51 --> 0:24:48,799
in the rumen of to a maximize/optimize rumen
fermentation and microbial growth.


504
0:24:48,799 --> 0:24:53,309
That's a take-home message. Now some of
you are saying, well I grind my corn


505
0:24:53,309 --> 0:24:54,429
on the farm. 


506
0:24:54,429 --> 0:24:55,97
Here's your action, 


507
0:24:55,97 --> 0:25:0,1
sneak out after the seminars or don't let
your wife or spouse catch you 


508
0:25:0,1 --> 0:25:3,39
and take a cup corn and put it through
your flour sifter 


509
0:25:3,39 --> 0:25:7,49
and see how much goes through your flour sifter
if it's dried corn. 


510
0:25:7,49 --> 0:25:9,7
2/3s of it should go through the
flour sifter. 


511
0:25:9,7 --> 0:25:13,82
Now you can also send samples to a commercial
lab and get you the exact number listed on


512
0:25:13,82 --> 0:25:14,7
this slide


513
0:25:14,7 --> 0:25:18,33
but these are some things you can
consider and look at out there on 


514
0:25:18,33 --> 0:25:20,17
your dairy farm.


515
0:25:20,17 --> 0:25:23,88
Another one is to make sure we process
corn silage properly.


516
0:25:23,88 --> 0:25:27,23
This is some work done by Joe Harrision
and he looked at all the published


517
0:25:27,23 --> 0:25:30,81
studies and there are two or three
take-home messages.


518
0:25:30,81 --> 0:25:32,799
Published studies means that


519
0:25:32,799 --> 0:25:34,1
good research


520
0:25:34,1 --> 0:25:38,45
in a journal of the dairy science or animal
science. Notice a response there is 


521
0:25:38,45 --> 0:25:39,98
around 2 pounds


522
0:25:39,98 --> 0:25:42,6
of 3.5 fat corrected milk 


523
0:25:42,6 --> 0:25:46,42
because generally speaking butter fat
test was higher and we saw some more milk.


524
0:25:46,42 --> 0:25:50,0
But look up there he noticed under that
1.1 pounds of milk 


525
0:25:50,0 --> 0:25:51,169
there's a minus 


526
0:25:51,169 --> 0:25:53,39
and there's a plus. Obviously,


527
0:25:53,39 --> 0:25:54,839
some corn was processed


528
0:25:54,839 --> 0:25:59,36
more optimally or correctly than others. So
the answers did you do it right?


529
0:25:59,36 --> 0:26:0,86
We're basically saying


530
0:26:0,86 --> 0:26:2,78
I don't need to see the kernels,


531
0:26:2,78 --> 0:26:5,33
I'd like now to crack them


532
0:26:5,33 --> 0:26:6,559
and hammer those dudes


533
0:26:6,559 --> 0:26:8,31
so i get rid of the kernel


534
0:26:8,31 --> 0:26:11,809
and expose that starch here in the
rumen of the animal 


535
0:26:11,809 --> 0:26:13,45
and the small intestine.


536
0:26:13,45 --> 0:26:16,39
You will see some other advantages 
as well. So the question is:


537
0:26:16,39 --> 0:26:20,39
have you looked at your corn silage? Have
you seen kernels in them? Do you have a


538
0:26:20,39 --> 0:26:24,1
3/4 inch theoretical length of chop 
to maintain good rumen mass


539
0:26:24,1 --> 0:26:27,59
and goo rumen function? So, just because we
process corn


540
0:26:27,59 --> 0:26:29,63
doesn't we've got it done right.


541
0:26:29,63 --> 0:26:33,289
Now there's nothing I can do about that
here in February and March but


542
0:26:33,289 --> 0:26:35,5
that's a take home message. 


543
0:26:35,5 --> 0:26:39,64
Another one is rumensin, lets look at
the bottom one. 


544
0:26:39,64 --> 0:26:43,9
300 milligrams of rumensin replaces 
about a 1 to 1.5 a pounds


545
0:26:43,9 --> 0:26:44,24
of corn. 


546
0:26:44,24 --> 0:26:48,37
That rumensin will cost you 2 to 3 cents. 
So there is not that many places in the United Stages


547
0:26:48,37 --> 0:26:52,12
where you can buy corn for 2 to 3
cents. There is no way you are going 
to get there.


548
0:26:52,12 --> 0:26:55,649
So there's another strategy according 
to Hoard's Dairyman 


549
0:26:55,649 --> 0:26:58,85
survey in 2008 about 22%
of our farmers


550
0:26:58,85 --> 0:26:59,799
reported


551
0:26:59,799 --> 0:27:1,33
they were feeding rumensin.


552
0:27:1,33 --> 0:27:6,15
There sits an opportunity. Now look 
at the levels we can feed. 


553
0:27:6,15 --> 0:27:9,5
You can see it can vary anywhere
from about a 


554
0:27:9,5 --> 0:27:13,21
120 milligrams to 660. So,certainly 
you have to ask, do I have the 


555
0:27:13,21 --> 0:27:13,83
optimal level? 


556
0:27:13,83 --> 0:27:17,9
And you and I are probably going to monitor
such things as manure consistency 


557
0:27:17,9 --> 0:27:18,279
and butter fat test


558
0:27:18,279 --> 0:27:20,1
to try to get a handle on that.


559
0:27:20,1 --> 0:27:22,529
Dick Wallace told me here at the 
University of Illinois


560
0:27:22,529 --> 0:27:25,299
yesterdays class working about 325. 


561
0:27:25,299 --> 0:27:28,51
We're like everybody else we start at 
275 to 280 


562
0:27:28,51 --> 0:27:32,7
and Dick has raised that up gradually
because they're cows appear to handle


563
0:27:32,7 --> 0:27:35,429
the higher levels of rumensin and
because the response in terms of


564
0:27:35,429 --> 0:27:36,38
feed efficiency


565
0:27:36,38 --> 0:27:38,21
impact is linear. 


566
0:27:38,21 --> 0:27:42,94
The longest the the rumen can handle those
higher levels of rumensin 


567
0:27:42,94 --> 0:27:43,5
or monensine 


568
0:27:43,5 --> 0:27:45,64
whichever name you want to use. 


569
0:27:45,64 --> 0:27:49,71
Another one is to steal some of that 
starch out of the manure. 


570
0:27:49,71 --> 0:27:53,8
This is the form from Jim Ferguson's 
lab at the University of Pennsylvania


571
0:27:53,8 --> 0:27:57,41
This represents about 18 or
20 herds about 75 groups


572
0:27:57,41 --> 0:28:1,15
of cows. I've talked to Jim about
couple months ago and he said they've expanded


573
0:28:1,15 --> 0:28:5,289
this and what you see here is how much
starch there is in the manure. 


574
0:28:5,289 --> 0:28:8,82
All your commercial labs are 13 
to 15dollars


575
0:28:8,82 --> 0:28:13,83
can't calculate, excuse me, can't measure
fecal starches and on the right (vertical axis)


576
0:28:13,83 --> 0:28:18,9
you are going to see what is called 
apparent digestibility of starch. So, that


577
0:28:18,9 --> 0:28:20,49
point 8 is 80 percent utilization,


578
0:28:20,49 --> 0:28:24,6
point 9 is 90 percent utilization to 100
which  means of all the starch


579
0:28:24,6 --> 0:28:30,51
there is theoretically  going to
be consumed. 
 
0:28:27.200,0:28:30.510
Notice, we don't get much higher than about
95 to 96 percent.


580
0:28:30,51 --> 0:28:33,42
There's always going to be some starch
that gets through for various reasons


581
0:28:33,42 --> 0:28:35,539
because of a biological system


582
0:28:35,539 --> 0:28:38,28
of the cow and her rates of passage
digestive track. 


583
0:28:38,28 --> 0:28:40,5
But look at this guys and gals


584
0:28:40,5 --> 0:28:44,26
some of these groups of cows are at
8 percent to 10 percent


585
0:28:44,26 --> 0:28:45,9
starch.


586
0:28:45,9 --> 0:28:47,599
Dave Lighty at Illinois did a study on
this


587
0:28:47,599 --> 0:28:51,299
for me last summer and the range in Illinois
4 and 10 percent.


588
0:28:51,299 --> 0:28:53,33
So the question is: so what?


589
0:28:53,33 --> 0:28:56,58
And the so-what answer sits right here.
The two trouble items. 


590
0:28:56,58 --> 0:29:1,389
Let's take the second one first, if you
can reduce fecal starch to by one unit


591
0:29:1,389 --> 0:29:2,47
in other words from


592
0:29:2,47 --> 0:29:3,96
6 percent to 5 percent or  


593
0:29:3,96 --> 0:29:6,75
9 percent to 8 percent. Jim Ferguson and
said


594
0:29:6,75 --> 0:29:9,75
that represents about 7/10s of a
pound of milk. 


595
0:29:9,75 --> 0:29:12,4
I think it's a pretty good idea. I would
take


596
0:29:12,4 --> 0:29:15,75
starch out if the  which I don't get
paid for and at letting the cow make


597
0:29:15,75 --> 0:29:19,37
milk out of it.  Sound like a no-brainer to
me at this stage of the game.


598
0:29:19,37 --> 0:29:23,419
Notice he also said that we should be at
least at 90 percent starch


599
0:29:23,419 --> 0:29:24,53
digestibility


600
0:29:24,53 --> 0:29:27,2
which means you should be something less
than 5.


601
0:29:27,2 --> 0:29:30,83
Dave Fisher knows some of these herds. 
I think we had 3 or


602
0:29:30,83 --> 0:29:34,389
4 hers out of 19 that  met this
criteria. 


603
0:29:34,389 --> 0:29:37,0
So as we would say there are
opportunities and again 


604
0:29:37,0 --> 0:29:38,85
I'm not charging you


605
0:29:38,85 --> 0:29:42,47
more cost perhaps to get this done.


606
0:29:42,47 --> 0:29:44,9
Then we going to go to the next one,


607
0:29:44,9 --> 0:29:48,37
feed additives and let me tell you these
are being jerked out  a mile a minute. 


608
0:29:48,37 --> 0:29:51,61
So what I did was to put together two
lists. 


609
0:29:51,61 --> 0:29:54,7
The first one is what I call and no
brainer.


610
0:29:54,7 --> 0:29:58,3
These were questions at our focus 
group and says well Hutjens


611
0:29:58,3 --> 0:30:1,86
I'm only going pick one or two but 
I can't buy all of them. 


612
0:30:1,86 --> 0:30:6,6
So these are my magic ones, in fact
Dick Wallace's class actually ranked these


613
0:30:6,6 --> 0:30:10,83
yesterday. The number one was rumensin
and I'll tell you the best students got it right.  


614
0:30:10,83 --> 0:30:15,27
So my view, I'm going to rank these for you, 
I would put rumensin number one.  


615
0:30:15,27 --> 0:30:19,86
i think probably put silage inoculants 
number two. 


616
0:30:19,86 --> 0:30:21,179
That is going to be a
tough one because


617
0:30:21,179 --> 0:30:25,519
you don't sell corn silage you 
only reap that advantage and


618
0:30:25,519 --> 0:30:26,19
decide once you feed it. 


619
0:30:26,19 --> 0:30:32,19
Rumen buffers and yeast cultures as three
and four.  Organic trace minerals and 
then Biotin.


620
0:30:32,19 --> 0:30:33,109
That's how


621
0:30:33,109 --> 0:30:34,89
I would rank them out.


622
0:30:34,89 --> 0:30:38,4
We can spend a whole seminar or
webinar I guess I should of this 


623
0:30:38,4 --> 0:30:39,26
whole list.


624
0:30:39,26 --> 0:30:42,83
And If you are interested, Jim is going to survey
you if you want to do that sometime in the


625
0:30:42,83 --> 0:30:46,679
future, we'd love to come back and do a
webinar on feed additives:


626
0:30:46,679 --> 0:30:49,19
which one, how much, and why we can use it.


627
0:30:49,19 --> 0:30:54,52
Now I also have a second list here and 
notice the name change on this it 
says additives as


628
0:30:54,52 --> 0:30:55,289
needed.


629
0:30:55,289 --> 0:30:59,48
So these are ones that I'm saying are
specially need. What do I mean by that?


630
0:30:59,48 --> 0:31:3,27
Well for example if I've got body
condition score three seven five cows,


631
0:31:3,27 --> 0:31:4,539
little pud suckers,


632
0:31:4,539 --> 0:31:8,1
then rumen protected niacin right
into the diet.


633
0:31:8,1 --> 0:31:11,24
If i have to have fatty liver diagnosed by
my veterinarian with lots of 


634
0:31:11,24 --> 0:31:14,399
ketosis then lots of rumen protective
choline


635
0:31:14,399 --> 0:31:15,78
would come into place. 


636
0:31:15,78 --> 0:31:19,85
If I'm going to drench cows at calving
to try to get blood glucose levels up to


637
0:31:19,85 --> 0:31:21,35
reduce ketoine production


638
0:31:21,35 --> 0:31:25,529
then propylene glycol becomes a very
favorite product. If I'm going to be


639
0:31:25,529 --> 0:31:27,7
finding molds in my feed stuffs


640
0:31:27,7 --> 0:31:32,7
mycotoxin binder can be very effective product 
as far as that goes.  


641
0:31:32,7 --> 0:31:33,909
In July my feed get hot in the bunk 


642
0:31:33,909 --> 0:31:37,95
I may out an acid in this case a
probionic di-acetate acetate  


643
0:31:37,95 --> 0:31:40,869
preservative in with my feed to keep from
it from getting hot 


644
0:31:40,869 --> 0:31:44,979
so the cows will eat more of it. So these are as
needed. You may need to them in summer, 


645
0:31:44,979 --> 0:31:47,14
may need them for fresh cows, 


646
0:31:47,14 --> 0:31:48,1
for fat cows, 


647
0:31:48,1 --> 0:31:51,809
and you try it target them because i'm
not sure i can justify selling 


648
0:31:51,809 --> 0:31:53,29
it to you for every cow


649
0:31:53,29 --> 0:31:54,12
in your herd 


650
0:31:54,12 --> 0:31:56,0
let's say on the 


651
0:31:56,0 --> 0:31:58,289
20th of March.


652
0:31:58,289 --> 0:32:5,38
The next Jersey cow pops up and says well
okay we've talked 
 
0:32:01.480,0:32:05.380
about additives and I think I've got
that sorted out or at least I think I have. 


653
0:32:5,38 --> 0:32:7,8
What about by-products?


654
0:32:7,8 --> 0:32:11,19
Now this is Illinois again so be very careful
and I'm looking at my list of people from 


655
0:32:11,19 --> 0:32:13,32
all over at this stage of the game.


656
0:32:13,32 --> 0:32:14,67
Here we can see


657
0:32:14,67 --> 0:32:18,13
a list and let me tell you what I've
done and then you know what which read


658
0:32:18,13 --> 0:32:18,59
it.


659
0:32:18,59 --> 0:32:22,669
Again, Jim Baltz is also showing where you
can find this. These are all loaded 


660
0:32:22,669 --> 0:32:26,25
online and Jim will come back and show
that at the end of the seminar when the Q&A


661
0:32:26,25 --> 0:32:28,76
period but, let's just read this


662
0:32:28,76 --> 0:32:32,46
let's pick on the bottom one:
distillers grains. That's the hot one. 


663
0:32:32,46 --> 0:32:36,92
Distillers grains is in yellow which
means in Illinois that's a good buy. 


664
0:32:36,92 --> 0:32:40,76
The next column or in the next one it says 10
to 15 percent of the ration 


665
0:32:40,76 --> 0:32:41,45
dry matter.


666
0:32:41,45 --> 0:32:46,95
So, the cows are eating 50 pounds of dry 
and you can add 5 to 7.5 pounds of 


667
0:32:46,95 --> 0:32:51,44
dried distillers grains or wet
distillers grains dry matter equivalent.


668
0:32:51,44 --> 0:32:53,329
Now the question is why is that ranged 


669
0:32:53,329 --> 0:32:54,16
and the answer is


670
0:32:54,16 --> 0:32:55,59
the oils 


671
0:32:55,59 --> 0:32:56,669
you have in the distillers grains. 


672
0:32:56,669 --> 0:32:58,44
If you have under 12 percent oil


673
0:32:58,44 --> 0:33:2,43
then you can go higher because that oil
tends to be a risk factor in high producing


674
0:33:2,43 --> 0:33:5,7
dairy cow rations.  


675
0:33:5,7 --> 0:33:6,99
If its a low oil, I go that backwards. 


676
0:33:6,99 --> 0:33:10,21
If it's a high oil I can only go 10
percent if it's a low oil 


677
0:33:10,21 --> 0:33:14,47
I can go as high as 15 percent.
Dakota Gold some of you in the Midwest


678
0:33:14,47 --> 0:33:15,75
will recognize that name. 


679
0:33:15,75 --> 0:33:18,29
Dakota Gold is probably the cadillac


680
0:33:18,29 --> 0:33:19,73
in distillers grains.


681
0:33:19,73 --> 0:33:21,759
They control the amino acid profile,


682
0:33:21,759 --> 0:33:25,7
they control of the variability, they
control the oil, so it becomes a


683
0:33:25,7 --> 0:33:26,33
very good product. 


684
0:33:26,33 --> 0:33:29,48
Got to pay a little more for it usually but by
the large you can push a little higher


685
0:33:29,48 --> 0:33:30,35
level.


686
0:33:30,35 --> 0:33:34,19
Then in yellow down there, fighting in 
the yellow down there, we ran this


687
0:33:34,19 --> 0:33:37,859
through Feed Valve. Feed Valve 3 developed by 
University of Wisconsin. 


688
0:33:37,859 --> 0:33:41,11
Some of you out there may use Sesame
that's the Ohio State's program. 


689
0:33:41,11 --> 0:33:43,83
The break even price 2.98 a ton. 


690
0:33:43,83 --> 0:33:48,67
The price that we saw and that this was
a month ago 1.62. Now low and behold,


691
0:33:48,67 --> 0:33:52,35
I just got my cheat sheet in here, that
came in the mail this morning, here 


692
0:33:52,35 --> 0:33:55,19
in the eastern corn belt and Iowa 


693
0:33:55,19 --> 0:33:58,42
1.15 to 1.25 a ton.  


694
0:33:58,42 --> 0:34:0,13
Wow, they are almost giving 
this stuff away.


695
0:34:0,13 --> 0:34:3,82
So, it simply says at this time
of tight economics


696
0:34:3,82 --> 0:34:7,61
distillers grains, wet brewers and of course you 
have got to be living fairly close to 


697
0:34:7,61 --> 0:34:9,97
Saint Louis at least in Illinois or close to
Milwaukee


698
0:34:9,97 --> 0:34:12,74
or close to Lacrosse your in the middle 
parts of the state. 


699
0:34:12,74 --> 0:34:16,44
They are a very good buy. You are not 
going to carry water very far 


700
0:34:16,44 --> 0:34:18,92
because the price o diesel and gas 
has gone back up.


701
0:34:18,92 --> 0:34:20,19
Corn gluten feed a 


702
0:34:20,19 --> 0:34:21,139
very good price


703
0:34:21,139 --> 0:34:25,689
and that price I've seen now drop down to 
100 dollars. In fact, from 


704
0:34:25,689 --> 0:34:29,109
one of our shippers here in 
Illinois, you could lock in 


705
0:34:29,109 --> 0:34:30,729
through August


706
0:34:30,729 --> 0:34:32,149
85 dollars.


707
0:34:32,149 --> 0:34:35,61
85  dollars a ton and now the is 
FOB and you still have to get it to your farm


708
0:34:35,61 --> 0:34:37,74
but, there's some real opportunities out
there.


709
0:34:37,74 --> 0:34:39,92
Fuzzy cottonseed


710
0:34:39,92 --> 0:34:43,59
the newest price I just got in
basically in Wisconsin,


711
0:34:43,59 --> 0:34:46,5
Minnesota, and northern Iowa


712
0:34:46,5 --> 0:34:47,31
2.40 a ton. 


713
0:34:47,31 --> 0:34:51,37
So, you can see while
they're not giving the stuff away it's a


714
0:34:51,37 --> 0:34:55,6
pretty good deal. Southern Illinois, Dave
at one of our focus groups, we had just a


715
0:34:55,6 --> 0:34:55,75
week ago


716
0:34:55,75 --> 0:34:58,23
we had 2.14 


717
0:34:58,23 --> 0:34:59,259
delivered in. 


718
0:34:59,259 --> 0:34:59,97
Wow. 


719
0:34:59,97 --> 0:35:2,28
I know Dr. Wallace you've been looking at
that as well. 


720
0:35:2,28 --> 0:35:5,88
So again, here's another opportunity to look
at and are using some of these,


721
0:35:5,88 --> 0:35:7,14
what I call very


722
0:35:7,14 --> 0:35:8,39
very competitive, 


723
0:35:8,39 --> 0:35:11,789
nutrition sources out there in your feeding
program. 


724
0:35:11,789 --> 0:35:15,669
Well let's look at another one, this is
called weigh back. Weigh backs is what the


725
0:35:15,669 --> 0:35:17,79
cow doesn't eat. 


726
0:35:17,79 --> 0:35:21,76
Shrink something that blows away, what the
birds eats, the rains spoils, or whatever the


727
0:35:21,76 --> 0:35:23,299
case is going to be.


728
0:35:23,299 --> 0:35:25,919
Well here's a huge huge list.


729
0:35:25,919 --> 0:35:26,989
Huge list. 


730
0:35:26,989 --> 0:35:29,549
I'm only going to pick out about
two of  these. 


731
0:35:29,549 --> 0:35:31,209
The first one is the big one. 


732
0:35:31,209 --> 0:35:34,939
Historically, we have recommended 
2 to 4 percent weigh back. 


733
0:35:34,939 --> 0:35:38,72
Basically, were saying get that down
below 2 percent


734
0:35:38,72 --> 0:35:40,459
and if you are a 


735
0:35:40,459 --> 0:35:41,16
really good


736
0:35:41,16 --> 0:35:44,979
feed bunk manager go to the empty bunk. 


737
0:35:44,979 --> 0:35:48,48
Dick mentioned yesterday in class that
here at the University of Illinois,


738
0:35:48,48 --> 0:35:50,17
in a group of 100 cows,


739
0:35:50,17 --> 0:35:53,9
they are taking away 50 pounds of wet
feed


740
0:35:53,9 --> 0:35:55,62
total from other cows. 


741
0:35:55,62 --> 0:35:58,529
That means that they have got 
about 2 pounds


742
0:35:58,529 --> 0:36:1,19
excuse me a .5 pound of weigh back, 


743
0:36:1,19 --> 0:36:5,559
a .5  pound of weigh  back
and that's less than a .25 of a


744
0:36:5,559 --> 0:36:6,26
pound.


745
0:36:6,26 --> 0:36:8,13
So basically,  they are almost at 0


746
0:36:8,13 --> 0:36:9,18
but, what are they doing?


747
0:36:9,18 --> 0:36:12,48
Fresh feeds when they com out of the parlor.
They're not running out of feed until


748
0:36:12,48 --> 0:36:15,35
about 20 minutes to a half hour before
they're going to the parlor. 


749
0:36:15,35 --> 0:36:17,629
So, they're really managing the bunk. 


750
0:36:17,629 --> 0:36:21,2
Second bullet point says if you are 
over 4 to 5 percent


751
0:36:21,2 --> 0:36:25,47
you can't feed it to steers,
 
0:36:22.830,0:36:25.470
you can't feed it to heifers because 
it is too valuable.


752
0:36:25,47 --> 0:36:28,719
You've got to go back to cows with it. 


753
0:36:28,719 --> 0:36:33,9
For example, Fair Oaks several
years ago Dr. Gordon Jones said


754
0:36:33,9 --> 0:36:37,49
they feed  to a 7 percent weigh back
in their high string. They pick up their


755
0:36:37,49 --> 0:36:41,189
weigh back and then use that as an
ingredient in their low cow string. 


756
0:36:41,189 --> 0:36:45,38
They don't sort so there is lots of 
weigh back in there and it's a very pretty


757
0:36:45,38 --> 0:36:48,49
predictable product and almost predictable
as


758
0:36:48,49 --> 0:36:49,18
corn silage


759
0:36:49,18 --> 0:36:52,88
or soy bean meal or any other ingredient 
you might have on the farm. 


760
0:36:52,88 --> 0:36:54,64
Then they feed that to an almost empty bunk. 


761
0:36:54,64 --> 0:36:56,96
So, you know that's the strategy
as well. 


762
0:36:56,96 --> 0:36:59,23
Make sure sure the cows do not sort it and 


763
0:36:59,23 --> 0:37:2,599
make sure you clean out the bunks. There are all
these tricks of traded that say 


764
0:37:2,599 --> 0:37:6,21
you want to manage weigh back but we've changed
our number.


765
0:37:6,21 --> 0:37:7,94
We'd say 2 to 4 is good.


766
0:37:7,94 --> 0:37:11,5
Back at the University of Illinois, Dr. 
Wallace manages our herd and they have


767
0:37:11,5 --> 0:37:15,93
to feed to a 10 percent weigh back because
that's what it's called ad lib, ad lib


768
0:37:15,93 --> 0:37:17,949
free choice all the cow can eat. 


769
0:37:17,949 --> 0:37:21,199
So basically, now what they're doing
it how do we manipulate that to try to


770
0:37:21,199 --> 0:37:24,109
reduce that in the non-research cows. 


771
0:37:24,109 --> 0:37:27,43
Another one is the one group versus the
multiple TMR


772
0:37:27,43 --> 0:37:29,499
and we have changed our answer. 


773
0:37:29,499 --> 0:37:32,54
Let's look at an example and
then we will discuss that.


774
0:37:32,54 --> 0:37:34,76
What I did was I went to Spartan 2.


775
0:37:34,76 --> 0:37:38,969
This is the least cost computer
program out of Michigan State.


776
0:37:38,969 --> 0:37:42,43
I looked at 2 different rations. I
look at an 80 pound TMR 


777
0:37:42,43 --> 0:37:44,13
and a 60 pound TMR and said


778
0:37:44,13 --> 0:37:46,749
what's the trade-off here guys
and gals?


779
0:37:46,749 --> 0:37:48,19
The 80 pound TMR


780
0:37:48,19 --> 0:37:49,79
there is no


781
0:37:49,79 --> 0:37:53,67
there is omega lakin here, there's no
additives in here, there is no bypass 
protein here. It is 


782
0:37:53,67 --> 0:37:54,909
corn, 


783
0:37:54,909 --> 0:38:0,99
corn silage, soybean meal and
alfalfa forage. Which could be haylage but


784
0:38:0,99 --> 0:38:3,619
it does not make a difference since it is 
alfalfa forage. We put the prices in (the 


785
0:38:3,619 --> 0:38:8,9
typical prices). In fact, we will show you
those prices here in just a few minutes


786
0:38:8,9 --> 0:38:9,16
and you can see here


787
0:38:9,16 --> 0:38:12,54
to feed 80 pounds of milk 
should take about 52 pounds


788
0:38:12,54 --> 0:38:17,4
of dry matter. That cost is at 11.8 cents
per pound of dry matter and costs 


789
0:38:17,4 --> 0:38:19,39
6.15 cents per cow.


790
0:38:19,39 --> 0:38:22,32
This is very similar what we saw the earlier
in our benchmarking. 


791
0:38:22,32 --> 0:38:23,989
The 60 pound TMR,


792
0:38:23,989 --> 0:38:25,329
is down to 4.90. 


793
0:38:25,329 --> 0:38:29,199
Notice we are down to 45 pounds of dry matter
and I've dropped a penny per pound 


794
0:38:29,199 --> 0:38:33,639
of dry matter off because I can use more 
forages in this feeding program. 


795
0:38:33,639 --> 0:38:37,689
Now remember I do not have any of those expensive 
additives or any other bells and whistles in here. 


796
0:38:37,689 --> 0:38:40,93
So, then I go to my next powerpoint and
say okay


797
0:38:40,93 --> 0:38:45,559
what's the savings. Just looking at the savings 
per cow per day: 1.25. 


798
0:38:45,559 --> 0:38:47,289
Holy smokers!


799
0:38:47,289 --> 0:38:48,38
That's huge!


800
0:38:48,38 --> 0:38:50,809
Huge.


801
0:38:50,809 --> 0:38:53,94
Remember they are going to eat 
about 6.5 pounds less dry matter. 


802
0:38:53,94 --> 0:38:55,6
So, I'm go ing to take that away 


803
0:38:55,6 --> 0:38:56,22
because the cows won't eat as much of it. 


804
0:38:56,22 --> 0:38:59,809
Some take in 6.7 pounds of dry matter


805
0:38:59,809 --> 0:39:3,299
away from that 1.25 and I
was going to use a high TMR


806
0:39:3,299 --> 0:39:6,289
because that what we are looking 
at and that's  about 80 cents a day. 


807
0:39:6,289 --> 0:39:9,26
So, that's the good news. They do not eat
much so that helped me out. 


808
0:39:9,26 --> 0:39:12,509
There are still 45 to 46 cents
laying on the table. 


809
0:39:12,509 --> 0:39:14,79
Now here comes your big question


810
0:39:14,79 --> 0:39:17,98
and you talk about an argument out in Reno. 
This one was hot


811
0:39:17,98 --> 0:39:20,1
and that says when I move a cow 


812
0:39:20,1 --> 0:39:21,909
from the high group to the low group


813
0:39:21,909 --> 0:39:23,539
does she drop in milk


814
0:39:23,539 --> 0:39:26,459
and if she does how much and how long.


815
0:39:26,459 --> 0:39:29,959
Our university data shows a 2-pound
drop. 


816
0:39:29,959 --> 0:39:33,169
This is some work done by Travis
Michael who sent it to us. 


817
0:39:33,169 --> 0:39:36,149
Another research study says 5 or 6 
pounds.


818
0:39:36,149 --> 0:39:38,9
Another study says 2 to 4 percent.


819
0:39:38,9 --> 0:39:42,999
So, you talk about a critical number because 
you can see if I drop 4 pounds


820
0:39:42,999 --> 0:39:45,68
of milk when I switch those cows
because they interact, they fight, 


821
0:39:45,68 --> 0:39:48,18
they eat less dry matter and they never
come back. 


822
0:39:48,18 --> 0:39:49,4
When they don't come back


823
0:39:49,4 --> 0:39:51,46
then that's going to cost me .40 cents. 


824
0:39:51,46 --> 0:39:54,509
So, my 1.25 that I saved


825
0:39:54,509 --> 0:39:55,9
is down to .06 cents.


826
0:39:55,9 --> 0:39:57,449
I'm down to .06 cents 


827
0:39:57,449 --> 0:40:0,92
but, I think I recommend that we look at
multiple groups


828
0:40:0,92 --> 0:40:4,34
because remember many of my fresh cows are
gonna have some added fat,


829
0:40:4,34 --> 0:40:8,3
they are going to have bypass protein in there,
there are probably going to have some buffer in there,


830
0:40:8,3 --> 0:40:11,18
going to have made this organic and trace
minerals for reproduction,


831
0:40:11,18 --> 0:40:12,95
some of you may have some POFA's


832
0:40:12,95 --> 0:40:15,679
(some polyunsaturated fatty acids) for
reproduction in there. 


833
0:40:15,679 --> 0:40:18,99
So, I'm saying we're gonna look at
multiple groups


834
0:40:18,99 --> 0:40:20,37
and we're looking like high and low,


835
0:40:20,37 --> 0:40:24,499
thin cow and fat cow group, 
heifers,


836
0:40:24,499 --> 0:40:25,64
to me if you have a heifer group 


837
0:40:25,64 --> 0:40:29,55
and a high group it is all the same.
They are going to get the same ration in these


838
0:40:29,55 --> 0:40:32,12
different groups but here comes the controversy.
One farmer says, 


839
0:40:32,12 --> 0:40:36,919
well should I leave my mastitis group, my staff
group and combine them with my clean cows?


840
0:40:36,919 --> 0:40:38,679
I don't think I am going to do that. 


841
0:40:38,679 --> 0:40:40,369
So here sits a farmer because of


842
0:40:40,369 --> 0:40:41,809
mastitis


843
0:40:41,809 --> 0:40:43,77
or because of 


844
0:40:43,77 --> 0:40:46,559
reproduction in other words 
he has got a bull pen. 


845
0:40:46,559 --> 0:40:50,169
So, he said I got all my pregnant cows
in one pen and the cows I want exposed 


846
0:40:50,169 --> 0:40:51,789
to the bull in another pen. 


847
0:40:51,789 --> 0:40:55,329
That we should pass on that one as well
so that's not a very clean one


848
0:40:55,329 --> 0:40:58,169
but some of you and i need to think
about we look at one group versus two


849
0:40:58,169 --> 0:40:59,939
groups as far as that goes.


850
0:40:59,939 --> 0:41:3,569
My last power point is fats and oils and 
all we are simply saying it


851
0:41:3,569 --> 0:41:5,129
you've got to make a decision.


852
0:41:5,129 --> 0:41:8,44
You've got to make a decision when 
you're going to use it. I'm using


853
0:41:8,44 --> 0:41:10,39
70 pounds


854
0:41:10,39 --> 0:41:13,1
of 4 percent fat corrected milk. So, any cow 
that is giving me about 


855
0:41:13,1 --> 0:41:16,769
2/3 quarters pounds of milk fat 
I'm going to add oil. 


856
0:41:16,769 --> 0:41:22,68
Oils are expensive fuzzy cottonseed,
soybeans, megalac, organic tallow, 


857
0:41:22,68 --> 0:41:23,66
or whatever you want to call 
it


858
0:41:23,66 --> 0:41:24,489
they're there. 


859
0:41:24,489 --> 0:41:28,79
So, at some point I'm gonna add that and
I'm gonna bring up about 


860
0:41:28,79 --> 0:41:29,539
5 to 5.5 percent of the ration. 


861
0:41:29,539 --> 0:41:31,31
I'm going to add to that 2 to 3 percent


862
0:41:31,31 --> 0:41:35,4
from oilseeds or distillers grains
first choice, animal fats my second


863
0:41:35,4 --> 0:41:39,66
choice and my inert fats third choice.
If you are feeding distillers grains extruded


864
0:41:39,66 --> 0:41:41,64
soybeans a 1/2 a pound


865
0:41:41,64 --> 0:41:44,95
of those fats and oils, i should say,
or otherwise we can 


866
0:41:44,95 --> 0:41:48,369
bugger up the rumen as far as
that goes. Then my strategies on 


867
0:41:48,369 --> 0:41:51,829
the rumen inert fats I would be like
to make a lecture energy booster 


868
0:41:51,829 --> 0:41:55,85
100. I would use that as a add on to
really improve reproduction,


869
0:41:55,85 --> 0:41:57,8
reduced body weight loss,


870
0:41:57,8 --> 0:41:58,94
to prevent ketosis and keep my cows


871
0:41:58,94 --> 0:42:1,829
it pretty good health and shape
at this stage of the game.


872
0:42:1,829 --> 0:42:4,89
I go to my next power point and Dave Fisher,


873
0:42:4,89 --> 0:42:6,8
I think we've got you turned on. 


874
0:42:6,8 --> 0:42:9,63
Dave Fisher from Edwardsville is going to
cover these next couple of power points.


875
0:42:9,63 --> 0:42:12,79
So, Dave I'll turn the program over to you.


876
0:42:12,79 --> 0:42:17,22
Okay, thank you Dr. Mike and certainly I
appreciate to visit about 


877
0:42:17,22 --> 0:42:20,8
the role of corn silage and forages 


878
0:42:20,8 --> 0:42:23,99
in the ration. We will go to our next slide


879
0:42:23,99 --> 0:42:25,599
to begin the discussion. Certainly, 


880
0:42:25,599 --> 0:42:27,29
we often hear and


881
0:42:27,29 --> 0:42:32,109
understand that forages are the
foundation of the total dairy 
feeding program. 


882
0:42:32,109 --> 0:42:35,73
I suggest that corn silage should be
the foundation


883
0:42:35,73 --> 0:42:38,409
of that forage portion of the 
feeding program 


884
0:42:38,409 --> 0:42:42,51
and I say that because we you've seen
many herds


885
0:42:42,51 --> 0:42:44,21
work very well with


886
0:42:44,21 --> 0:42:48,369
a high-level of corn silage in the diet.
What level should it be?


887
0:42:48,369 --> 0:42:53,72
I suggest that perhaps a ratio of
2/3's corn silage, 1/3 alfalfa


888
0:42:53,72 --> 0:42:55,2
and on a dry matter basis


889
0:42:55,2 --> 0:42:59,789
really fits well for high producing dairy cows
because of the need for a high energy


890
0:42:59,789 --> 0:43:0,39
fed


891
0:43:0,39 --> 0:43:3,6
while still maintaining adequate
fiber levels. 


892
0:43:3,6 --> 0:43:6,66
Matter of fact, I believe that Dr.
Dick Wallace, who will come in later,


893
0:43:6,66 --> 0:43:9,18
at the U of I herd has them at 


894
0:43:9,18 --> 0:43:11,849
2/3rd and 1/3rd.  


895
0:43:11,849 --> 0:43:16,969
The portion of corn silage to alfalfa
also though will be influenced by other


896
0:43:16,969 --> 0:43:18,86
feed stuffs or byproducts.


897
0:43:18,86 --> 0:43:22,27
I think Mike that earlier in the
discussion about


898
0:43:22,27 --> 0:43:27,2
byproducts and how they could reduce 
the cost of of the ration. So


899
0:43:27,2 --> 0:43:32,4
certainly again, we are going to take into
consideration of byproducts in the diet


900
0:43:32,4 --> 0:43:32,859
and


901
0:43:32,859 --> 0:43:36,59
basing that on the quality of our
harvested forages


902
0:43:36,59 --> 0:43:36,91
we now


903
0:43:36,91 --> 0:43:40,459
had a chance to to really build really
neat ration.


904
0:43:40,459 --> 0:43:43,47
In order to do that we have to be
evaluate 


905
0:43:43,47 --> 0:43:44,509
the quality


906
0:43:44,509 --> 0:43:49,239
and a lot of times people say well it
looks good, it smells good, the cows are eating,


907
0:43:49,239 --> 0:43:52,219
but they really do not have a good handle. 


908
0:43:52,219 --> 0:43:54,75
We suggest again that you 


909
0:43:54,75 --> 0:43:56,309
use some good tools. 


910
0:43:56,309 --> 0:43:59,619
The Newark test that came out a few 
years ago and


911
0:43:59,619 --> 0:44:1,8
the NDF Digestibility test


912
0:44:1,8 --> 0:44:4,479
is really is a great tool. 


913
0:44:4,479 --> 0:44:10,319
That helps to determine which forage
or which specific variety will be


914
0:44:10,319 --> 0:44:15,439
better it my ration to provide the
needed energy to the diet. So, again


915
0:44:15,439 --> 0:44:18,11
that NDF Digestibility that
test and


916
0:44:18,11 --> 0:44:20,59
many laboratories are doing that


917
0:44:20,59 --> 0:44:22,99
and we'd like to see corn silage


918
0:44:22,99 --> 0:44:24,13
greater than 57 percent


919
0:44:24,13 --> 0:44:28,26
NDF Digestibility that is on a
48 hour test. We can talk more


920
0:44:28,26 --> 0:44:34,2
about that in the unit we want to. Also,
we look at different types of 


921
0:44:34,2 --> 0:44:38,81
varieties or different types of 
corn silages such as the role of 


922
0:44:38,81 --> 0:44:43,53
BMR, brown midrib. We'd like
to suggest here again to we're looking


923
0:44:43,53 --> 0:44:48,109
for high-quality forages in 
brown midrib corn silages.


924
0:44:48,109 --> 0:44:50,99
Which brings that to the table because of the
whole lignin,


925
0:44:50,99 --> 0:44:55,17
high digestibility, and we can also get into
the starch numbers and things of that


926
0:44:55,17 --> 0:44:56,639
nature as well.


927
0:44:56,639 --> 0:45:0,789
One thing that we always have to
remember if we would and that is


928
0:45:0,789 --> 0:45:3,34
strategic use of those forages,


929
0:45:3,34 --> 0:45:4,89
by that I'm saying, 


930
0:45:4,89 --> 0:45:7,14
we really have to take a look at


931
0:45:7,14 --> 0:45:12,989
how do we position those to the various
animals that we'd feed. For example, heifer


932
0:45:12,989 --> 0:45:16,39
verses dry cow high cow 
verses low cow 


933
0:45:16,39 --> 0:45:18,9
in the lactation.


934
0:45:18,9 --> 0:45:21,769
My final point is that because
of that forced position of 


935
0:45:21,769 --> 0:45:23,279
those feeds to meet the 
animal needs;


936
0:45:23,279 --> 0:45:25,66
we really also need to understand


937
0:45:25,66 --> 0:45:29,61
the importance position forages
to meet the challenges


938
0:45:29,61 --> 0:45:31,649
of lowering the feed cost


939
0:45:31,649 --> 0:45:35,239
and here again corn silage 


940
0:45:35,239 --> 0:45:36,809
fits that role. 


941
0:45:36,809 --> 0:45:41,4
The next slide gives us a bit of a 
demonstration or a chance to make 
some assumptions


942
0:45:41,4 --> 0:45:42,36
and compare


943
0:45:42,36 --> 0:45:44,5
how forage costs will come out. 


944
0:45:44,5 --> 0:45:47,99
We're going to look at a 1350 pound
Holstein cow


945
0:45:47,99 --> 0:45:51,659
with 80 pounds of milk, in a positive 
energy state,


946
0:45:51,659 --> 0:45:56,79
using alfalfa hay at 
180 dollars a ton, 


947
0:45:56,79 --> 0:45:58,379
corn silage at 45 dollars a ton, 


948
0:45:58,379 --> 0:45:59,78
and you can read the 


949
0:45:59,78 --> 0:46:1,65
corn grain at 4.50 and


950
0:46:1,65 --> 0:46:3,939
soybean meal 300.


951
0:46:3,939 --> 0:46:7,69
Now, I understand that these prices will vary
from place to place


952
0:46:7,69 --> 0:46:10,569
but the point is those numbers 


953
0:46:10,569 --> 0:46:11,4
represent


954
0:46:11,4 --> 0:46:15,689
was showing up now in the slide
economics of the corn silage. We took 


955
0:46:15,689 --> 0:46:22,49
the Spartan 2 program to do a comparison 
of this corn silage at various


956
0:46:22,49 --> 0:46:24,38
levels of the feeding program.


957
0:46:24,38 --> 0:46:27,549
As we start to look at this and 
compare


958
0:46:27,549 --> 0:46:29,44
it's pretty easy to see


959
0:46:29,44 --> 0:46:32,309
as we'd increase corn silage in the diet


960
0:46:32,309 --> 0:46:34,989
we decrease the total feed cost to the cow. 


961
0:46:34,989 --> 0:46:40,439
If we look at that the 0 on corn silage
or all alfalfa hay diet it gets to be 


962
0:46:40,439 --> 0:46:45,929
the most costly and if we go to all 
corn silage and  no alfalfa diet


963
0:46:45,929 --> 0:46:49,149
we can save about 1 dollar per cow per day 


964
0:46:49,149 --> 0:46:49,89
but, yet


965
0:46:49,89 --> 0:46:54,799
in reality even though the Spartan 
program can do that in reality on the


966
0:46:54,799 --> 0:46:59,9
farm you do not want to have a diet of
all alfalfa or all corn silage. 


967
0:46:59,9 --> 0:47:1,51
We bring both together 


968
0:47:1,51 --> 0:47:4,86
and their again we start looking at
should that be a 50/50, 


969
0:47:4,86 --> 0:47:6,809
80/20.


970
0:47:6,809 --> 0:47:12,449
You need to make that decision 
as a dairy producer or nutritionist 


971
0:47:12,449 --> 0:47:13,559
but the point that we need to make here is 


972
0:47:13,559 --> 0:47:19,999
that corn silage is an excellent source
of feed stuffs that will bring, as Mike


973
0:47:19,999 --> 0:47:24,249
Mike Hutjens said earlier, the cheapest
source of energy to the ration. 


974
0:47:24,249 --> 0:47:26,559
So we really want to use corn silage 


975
0:47:26,559 --> 0:47:32,39
as our foundation of the forage program and then
bring in our good quality alfalfa


976
0:47:32,39 --> 0:47:34,369
and then bring in out byproducts 
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, 


977
0:47:34,369 --> 0:47:36,979
to cheapen up our ration as best we can.


978
0:47:36,979 --> 0:47:40,249
Well, I skimmed over that pretty
quickly and I think we can talk more about


979
0:47:40,249 --> 0:47:41,2
this in the Q & A


980
0:47:41,2 --> 0:47:42,799
if you want to. 


981
0:47:42,799 --> 0:47:46,999
I think if we bring up the next slide it
will lead me into introducing my


982
0:47:46,999 --> 0:47:51,389
colleague Dr. Dick Wallace our U of I
Extension dairy veternarian who's going to


983
0:47:51,389 --> 0:47:54,899
visit with on culling strategies, Dick.


984
0:47:54,899 --> 0:47:58,799
Okay, thanks Dave. I don't have a lot to
contribute


985
0:47:58,799 --> 0:48:1,95
here except for this one slice. If you want to
jump to the next slide.


986
0:48:1,95 --> 0:48:5,5
It's probably good that Mike only has one
slide for me today because of 


987
0:48:5,5 --> 0:48:6,75
my head cold and


988
0:48:6,75 --> 0:48:9,509
I've been muted the whole time so I'm not
coughing


989
0:48:9,509 --> 0:48:11,339
through the entire seminar.


990
0:48:11,339 --> 0:48:14,799
When were thinking about
these marginal cows we need to


991
0:48:14,799 --> 0:48:18,939
think about what we're gonna do moving
cows out that are not profitable.


992
0:48:18,939 --> 0:48:21,399
So, move them out of the herd out if
she's not producing milk. You need to really


993
0:48:21,399 --> 0:48:25,779
determine on a herd by herd basis what
is the break even milk deal.


994
0:48:25,779 --> 0:48:27,869
Is it 45 or 50 pounds?


995
0:48:27,869 --> 0:48:31,719
What's your break even milk
yield for cows in your herd.


996
0:48:31,719 --> 0:48:35,449
Then you need to develop a strategy. Obviously,
if the cow is pregnant you're probably going


997
0:48:35,449 --> 0:48:36,899
to keep around.


998
0:48:36,899 --> 0:48:40,499
Maybe what you need to do with that
cow if she's down below say a 30 pound


999
0:48:40,499 --> 0:48:41,309
level


1000
0:48:41,309 --> 0:48:45,67
is  to move her under some kind of a lower
energy diet or even a non lactating diet and dry


1001
0:48:45,67 --> 0:48:46,789
her off.


1002
0:48:46,789 --> 0:48:51,139
Hopefully, she's not going to get too fat
which leads to health problems later on


1003
0:48:51,139 --> 0:48:52,49
but certainly she still is a


1004
0:48:52,49 --> 0:48:56,5
valuable asset to the farm and
potentially depending again on how long


1005
0:48:56,5 --> 0:48:58,959
it's going to be until she calves again.


1006
0:48:58,959 --> 0:49:1,87
It is really going to depend on how many
holes you have in the herd.


1007
0:49:1,87 --> 0:49:4,49
If you have spots to put cows


1008
0:49:4,49 --> 0:49:8,43
verses if the herd is at maximum 
capacity from a parlor stand point.


1009
0:49:8,43 --> 0:49:11,829
Those are a lot of different strategies you
need to think about that


1010
0:49:11,829 --> 0:49:15,959
certainly moving those those marginal
cows out certainly is another


1011
0:49:15,959 --> 0:49:20,199
possible to think about. One of the
things that were doing it university is


1012
0:49:20,199 --> 0:49:23,379
were basically feeding our cull cows


1013
0:49:23,379 --> 0:49:25,469
to increase their value


1014
0:49:25,469 --> 0:49:29,66
at a later time. So, we might
be them from 30 to 60 days. Now,


1015
0:49:29,66 --> 0:49:33,569
Dr. Hutjens mentioned earlier that
we need to be feeding that expensive


1016
0:49:33,569 --> 0:49:35,419
lactating cow weigh back


1017
0:49:35,419 --> 0:49:37,419
back to other cows.


1018
0:49:37,419 --> 0:49:40,709
Certainly, that is one strategy and
you know there are some concerns


1019
0:49:40,709 --> 0:49:45,19
possibly about bio security and 
if there is any fecal contamination.


1020
0:49:45,19 --> 0:49:48,359
I don't know if we really want to be
feeding that to other lactating cows from either


1021
0:49:48,359 --> 0:49:52,69
salmonella or johns disease or
depending on what the


1022
0:49:52,69 --> 0:49:53,859
diseases are in the herd. 


1023
0:49:53,859 --> 0:49:58,179
We take any weigh back that we have
for me from the tie stall barns 


1024
0:49:58,179 --> 0:50:1,429
or free stall barns as mentioned 
Travis has us feeding


1025
0:50:1,429 --> 0:50:2,469
down to 


1026
0:50:2,469 --> 0:50:5,529
pretty much 0 weigh back in the 
free stall lots


1027
0:50:5,529 --> 0:50:9,549
but any weigh back that we might have been
picking up we have been feeding our
cull cows to 


1028
0:50:9,549 --> 0:50:13,149
increase their value. We move them from
a thin 


1029
0:50:13,149 --> 0:50:15,869
yellow fat cow to a white fat cow


1030
0:50:15,869 --> 0:50:19,229
that's going to bring you maybe
up to .05 cents more per pound 


1031
0:50:19,229 --> 0:50:20,799
once she goes to slaughter. 


1032
0:50:20,799 --> 0:50:22,959
So, just some strategies to think about


1033
0:50:22,959 --> 0:50:26,319
and I'm going to turn it over back to Dr. Mike. 


1034
0:50:26,319 --> 0:50:29,829
Well thanks very much Dave and Dick. This
wraps up the formal part of our 


1035
0:50:29,829 --> 0:50:30,61
seminar.


1036
0:50:30,61 --> 0:50:34,37
Our summary looks pretty straight
forward to me. I think if 


1037
0:50:34,37 --> 0:50:37,45
you're going to be in this dairy business
those 3 points we can't argue very


1038
0:50:37,45 --> 0:50:40,59
much about at this stage of the game 
and they are pretty


1039
0:50:40,59 --> 0:50:45,32
straight forward. Again, if you found value
in this write this date down now. This


1040
0:50:45,32 --> 0:50:49,77
is our next webinar Dave Fischer will be leading 
on that. Both Dick and I will be online and 


1041
0:50:49,77 --> 0:50:53,24
be part of that one as well. You can see
the time and we are going to do it at noon.


1042
0:50:53,24 --> 0:50:56,26
I understand in China that's not a
very good time but 


1043
0:50:56,26 --> 0:50:59,67
that gentlemen has all he needs 
I think at this point.


1044
0:50:59,67 --> 0:51:2,619
There is the URL and you will be able to 
find that in other places as well.


1045
0:51:2,619 --> 0:51:5,16
We would certainly welcome your


1046
0:51:5,16 --> 0:51:6,94
involvement if you


1047
0:51:6,94 --> 0:51:10,369
have that time to sneak in for one hour
as far as that goes. 


1048
0:51:10,369 --> 0:51:13,84
We also welcome you to come to our
website you can


1049
0:51:13,84 --> 0:51:18,2
go there as I said earlier the Dairy
Net sites are excellent ones as well and


1050
0:51:18,2 --> 0:51:19,93
you can get to us from there


1051
0:51:19,93 --> 0:51:23,79
as well. We welcome you to
come and visit those websites I think


1052
0:51:23,79 --> 0:51:26,349
there is really good information there
for you.


1053
0:51:26,349 --> 0:51:29,629
So, at this time we welcome your questions!
Jim we've got a couple of good ones 


1054
0:51:29,629 --> 0:51:33,96
already here and any of you that want to 
type in a question.


1055
0:51:33,96 --> 0:51:38,25
I will go right ahead and Jim will monitor one
as I will at this stage of the game. We


1056
0:51:38,25 --> 0:51:41,41
had a comment from an Illinois
farmer who says, you know what


1057
0:51:41,41 --> 0:51:45,58
we can make all corn silage work 
very well. In fact I have 


1058
0:51:45,58 --> 0:51:48,77
been on this farm and they are almost at 
100 percent 


1059
0:51:48,77 --> 0:51:52,53
corn silage on their farm and of course
becomes very


1060
0:51:52,53 --> 0:51:56,75
economical as Dave pointed out. So, just
a comment Dave that you do have one detracter


1061
0:51:56,75 --> 0:51:59,69
out there and you probably
know who that crook is. 


1062
0:51:59,69 --> 0:52:2,799
If not I will tell a little bit later. 


1063
0:52:2,799 --> 0:52:4,94
We had a comment 


1064
0:52:4,94 --> 0:52:8,559
that came in from a colleague in
Pennsylvania who said, 


1065
0:52:8,559 --> 0:52:12,43
Mike I haven't seen any data on
finely ground corn is higher than


1066
0:52:12,43 --> 0:52:13,49
than high moisture corn 


1067
0:52:13,49 --> 0:52:15,529
or steamed flaked and he questions that.


1068
0:52:15,529 --> 0:52:19,159
His point is well-taken and the
good news is that I can to say blame it on


1069
0:52:19,159 --> 0:52:22,29
the NRC 1999 because I lifted 
those numbers


1070
0:52:22,29 --> 0:52:27,72
directly out of NRC. So, I think
the point we have to make is that 


1071
0:52:27,72 --> 0:52:29,22
if your high moisture
corn is too dry,


1072
0:52:29,22 --> 0:52:32,69
if your steam flaking and it doesn't have
the right density, if you're grinding your


1073
0:52:32,69 --> 0:52:35,43
corn is the right particle size you are
going to lose some value.


1074
0:52:35,43 --> 0:52:39,98
My view is I think that by the finely
ground corn, the steam flaked corn,


1075
0:52:39,98 --> 0:52:43,95
and the the high moisture corn are
kissing cousins. If you really want to play


1076
0:52:43,95 --> 0:52:44,76
hardball


1077
0:52:44,76 --> 0:52:48,47
I think the real winner is steamed flaked 
corn. I say that not because of my


1078
0:52:48,47 --> 0:52:51,81
Pennsylvania colleague but basically because
if you look at the data


1079
0:52:51,81 --> 0:52:55,98
that was done at Ag Way was not 
statistical. There's a little bit


1080
0:52:55,98 --> 0:53:0,9
more kick on on the protein site on
the steam flaked corn. 


1081
0:53:0,9 --> 0:53:4,509
We had another question it came up here bit
earlier who said,  what about


1082
0:53:4,509 --> 0:53:7,98
this break even. The question is what do
I mean by break even.


1083
0:53:7,98 --> 0:53:11,59
I'll answer in 2 or 3 ways and 
then Dave I'll let you in because you worked


1084
0:53:11,59 --> 0:53:12,38
with one of our


1085
0:53:12,38 --> 0:53:16,45
co ops on this one here. One break
even simply said I'm just going to 


1086
0:53:16,45 --> 0:53:20,99
cover my costs. I'm not looking at
debt retirement or principle.


1087
0:53:20,99 --> 0:53:25,83
that looks to be around fifteen fifteen
fifty or somewhere in that range there.


1088
0:53:25,83 --> 0:53:27,2
Most of us have debts 


1089
0:53:27,2 --> 0:53:30,93
that number i've seen from FBM
that number around 18 and 19


1090
0:53:30,93 --> 0:53:35,27
dollars here in Illinois. Then some 
of you want to make money on this thing and


1091
0:53:35,27 --> 0:53:38,63
that means you're going to be around
20.  In fact, if you look at USDA they


1092
0:53:38,63 --> 0:53:43,3
cut the corn belt break even pricing
some where between 20 and 21 dollars


1093
0:53:43,3 --> 0:53:43,77
per hundred weight. 


1094
0:53:43,77 --> 0:53:48,16
So, I think that all goes into play. So, 
one of my students said, Hutjens how do you get


1095
0:53:48,16 --> 0:53:51,66
away with that crap. I mean if you are
getting 12 dollars from milk and


1096
0:53:51,66 --> 0:53:53,549
that's what looks like it's going to be


1097
0:53:53,549 --> 0:53:54,82
for February


1098
0:53:54,82 --> 0:53:59,779
here in Illinois and the minimal
cost is 15 . The answers is  well


1099
0:53:59,779 --> 0:54:3,719
you don't make 3 dollars for labor.
You know you don't pay yourself on that


1100
0:54:3,719 --> 0:54:6,409
or you have other ways to differ some
of those costs


1101
0:54:6,409 --> 0:54:7,26
try to get that job


1102
0:54:7,26 --> 0:54:9,959
done as far as that goes.


1103
0:54:9,959 --> 0:54:12,229
Okay, Dave any comments on that?


1104
0:54:12,229 --> 0:54:17,11
Yes, I disagree. I think also then
we're seeing actually paying 


1105
0:54:17,11 --> 0:54:18,409
cash costs  and some of these 


1106
0:54:18,409 --> 0:54:21,4
costs are for going at this 
time 


1107
0:54:21,4 --> 0:54:23,119
when you only get the 12 dollar milk. 


1108
0:54:23,119 --> 0:54:26,23
When we talk about that
5.15-50 


1109
0:54:26,23 --> 0:54:27,349
cost-production


1110
0:54:27,349 --> 0:54:33,45
we do have that included in there certainly
a value for the facilities, a value for 


1111
0:54:33,45 --> 0:54:37,599
the cost of the cow but, we just do not
have that return on investment or that


1112
0:54:37,599 --> 0:54:38,779
ability to pay


1113
0:54:38,779 --> 0:54:41,339
off debt etcetera like Mike said. 


1114
0:54:41,339 --> 0:54:44,92
Well David, James thinks that I have 
screwed up answering that


1115
0:54:44,92 --> 0:54:48,539
question and I lead you astray as well.
He's thinking that the the question


1116
0:54:48,539 --> 0:54:53,239
may relate  to that break even price on out
byproduct feeds. That break even price on 


1117
0:54:53,239 --> 0:54:55,17
byproduct feeds is based on


1118
0:54:55,17 --> 0:54:56,749
the 5 target ingredients. 


1119
0:54:56,749 --> 0:54:59,24
We're using shelled corn as an energy
source.


1120
0:54:59,24 --> 0:55:2,839
soybean meal as a source of protein
and rumen undegradable protein, 


1121
0:55:2,839 --> 0:55:7,5
we are using tallow as the price for fat
or oil, we are using dicalcium phosphate as a


1122
0:55:7,5 --> 0:55:11,47
source phosphorus and using lime stone as
a source of calcium. So, if you got a


1123
0:55:11,47 --> 0:55:15,3
byproduct feed like distillers grain 
that's high in phosphorous then it adds


1124
0:55:15,3 --> 0:55:18,599
value. Some of you in this line will say, 
Hutjens you are cheating because 


1125
0:55:18,599 --> 0:55:21,289
a lot of that phosphorous and this is way too
high already and that we have


1126
0:55:21,289 --> 0:55:22,78
some problems with environment about it. 


1127
0:55:22,78 --> 0:55:24,96
Well, I'm sorry that's how the program
works.


1128
0:55:24,96 --> 0:55:28,54
So, we are simply saying when
you can get that feed delivered to your


1129
0:55:28,54 --> 0:55:33,28
farm at that price that's below
break even than it's a better buy than


1130
0:55:33,28 --> 0:55:37,61
those 5 basing base ingredients. Norman Saint Pierre 
used a combination of feed stuffs. 


1131
0:55:37,61 --> 0:55:41,8
So, instead of looking at an ingredient
he is looking at the prices of hay and corn


1132
0:55:41,8 --> 0:55:43,72
silage and has a fairly, 


1133
0:55:43,72 --> 0:55:45,27
I assume complicated,


1134
0:55:45,27 --> 0:55:46,79
system that says


1135
0:55:46,79 --> 0:55:51,319
then cottonseed then breaks even at a
certain point but he's using feeds 


1136
0:55:51,319 --> 0:55:53,459
while were using feed ingredients. 


1137
0:55:53,459 --> 0:55:56,129
I there are a couple other private
companies have some other internal


1138
0:55:56,129 --> 0:55:57,33
software program.


1139
0:55:57,33 --> 0:56:0,239
In fact, Spartan also does this in what they
call shadow prices and


1140
0:56:0,239 --> 0:56:3,21
it will give you the same kind of thing
as far as that goes.


1141
0:56:3,21 --> 0:56:6,64
David, do you want to make a comment
here on a comment that says what


1142
0:56:6,64 --> 0:56:12,39
are the disadvantages of all core silage
and basically 0 alfalfa diets?


1143
0:56:12,39 --> 0:56:15,869
WEll, I thin one of the  disadvantages 
would be that 


1144
0:56:15,869 --> 0:56:20,459
corn silage  brings a low amount of proteins
to the diet so


1145
0:56:20,459 --> 0:56:25,429
unless you can bring in that protein 
and a reduced cost or lower cost


1146
0:56:25,429 --> 0:56:30,59
in the form of by-products like you said
corn distillers or whatever


1147
0:56:30,59 --> 0:56:33,699
unless you can do that then
you have to stay with the
 alfalfa because it


1148
0:56:33,699 --> 0:56:35,729
brings in that protein.


1149
0:56:35,729 --> 0:56:38,809
Advantage of course is that high
energy


1150
0:56:38,809 --> 0:56:40,68
with processed corn silage 


1151
0:56:40,68 --> 0:56:42,549
your able to maintain


1152
0:56:42,549 --> 0:56:47,469
good effective fiber and so as our
Illinois dairyman mentioned he was


1153
0:56:47,469 --> 0:56:52,4
going all corn silage and that can be done. 
A lot of times I'd say 


1154
0:56:52,4 --> 0:56:53,27
and 80-20


1155
0:56:53,27 --> 0:56:55,539
would certainly maybe play it well


1156
0:56:55,539 --> 0:56:58,5
because I like to have about 
5 pounds of that longer


1157
0:56:58,5 --> 0:57:1,82
alfalfa scratch backer. Again,


1158
0:57:1,82 --> 0:57:5,569
I think the point is if you 
can balance that ration 


1159
0:57:5,569 --> 0:57:10,189
with good economical byproducts to bring 
up my protein you can get bye with very little


1160
0:57:10,189 --> 0:57:12,649
alfalfa in the diet. 


1161
0:57:12,649 --> 0:57:16,289
David great answer and I just wanted you 
to know that our colleague in Illinois


1162
0:57:16,289 --> 0:57:20,39
says, this is interesting, he knows
4.28


1163
0:57:20,39 --> 0:57:24,9
feed costs.  I assume that's per cow per day.
Wow, that is a 


1164
0:57:24,9 --> 0:57:28,6
really good number ands he's going to
do really well. I don't think it's


1165
0:57:28,6 --> 0:57:28,89
per hundred weight but 


1166
0:57:28,89 --> 0:57:32,799
respond back if it is. We had another quick
question and I'll answer these quickly. I don't


1167
0:57:32,799 --> 0:57:35,89
know if other guys see them or is it just me?
Well, I'm just seeing them. 


1168
0:57:35,89 --> 0:57:39,199
Okay, here comes a question that 
says give me an example of an acid base bunker


1169
0:57:39,199 --> 0:57:43,559
extender. Well certainly the easiest one
to go to is Camin, not that


1170
0:57:43,559 --> 0:57:44,19
I'm being paid


1171
0:57:44,19 --> 0:57:47,339
by Camin industry, but
basically they have something 


1172
0:57:47,339 --> 0:57:48,7
called bunk curb 


1173
0:57:48,7 --> 0:57:51,71
Which is simply is a proprionic acid based
additive 


1174
0:57:51,71 --> 0:57:55,97
and for 6 or 8 cents you mix this into 
your TMR mixer. Its  got


1175
0:57:55,97 --> 0:58:0,31
prop in it and it retards the secondary
fermentation. So, it tends to keep the


1176
0:58:0,31 --> 0:58:2,68
feed cooler for a longer period of time.


1177
0:58:2,68 --> 0:58:5,91
I've also seen another product that has
di-acetate in it. 


1178
0:58:5,91 --> 0:58:9,69
Which is an acetic acid type
byproduct and that also seems to hold


1179
0:58:9,69 --> 0:58:14,239
back the secondary fermentation. Some of you
guys will put that in the top of your


1180
0:58:14,239 --> 0:58:15,27
silos.


1181
0:58:15,27 --> 0:58:18,95
The top 10 feet of your silo, you'll put 
some proprionic acid in there because it


1182
0:58:18,95 --> 0:58:22,339
doesn't pack as well and you don't want
that stuff to get moldy and get hot on


1183
0:58:22,339 --> 0:58:24,42
you as much. They'll treat the top


1184
0:58:24,42 --> 0:58:29,19
top 10 feet, the top 3 or 4 doors,
of their silo to get that same thing done. 


1185
0:58:29,19 --> 0:58:31,38
Question came in here,


1186
0:58:31,38 --> 0:58:34,509
do you have any comments or
recommendations how to maintain rumen


1187
0:58:34,509 --> 0:58:36,8
health and function to prevent
rumen acidosis 


1188
0:58:36,8 --> 0:58:39,539
that can impact feed efficiency. 


1189
0:58:39,539 --> 0:58:40,489
Boy, 


1190
0:58:40,489 --> 0:58:43,39
this is the kitchen sink and


1191
0:58:43,39 --> 0:58:47,89
we may delay the full answer to that. We
are simply saying if you have acidosis that


1192
0:58:47,89 --> 0:58:52,36
we are expecting the feed efficiency to
.drop about a tenth of a point. I have


1193
0:58:52,36 --> 0:58:55,289
no research to back that up but it we know
what does impact.


1194
0:58:55,289 --> 0:58:59,369
That means if you have acidosis probably
thats 30 cents per cow per day range


1195
0:58:59,369 --> 0:59:0,4
is going to cost you.


1196
0:59:0,4 --> 0:59:4,75
We do that by such things like looking at 
fecal consistency, we look at


1197
0:59:4,75 --> 0:59:6,699
dry matter variation, 


1198
0:59:6,699 --> 0:59:10,68
we look at lameness
scoring on cows,


1199
0:59:10,68 --> 0:59:14,9
you could maybe use milk components in some
cases butter fat but Wisconsin people argue


1200
0:59:14,9 --> 0:59:18,589
that's not a very sensitive test on that
but, that's how I would try to do


1201
0:59:18,589 --> 0:59:19,16
that.


1202
0:59:19,16 --> 0:59:22,49
Then if you  have acidosis then
comes the big laundry list such things


1203
0:59:22,49 --> 0:59:23,33
as,


1204
0:59:23,33 --> 0:59:24,809
Dave's already pointed out, 


1205
0:59:24,809 --> 0:59:26,17
cud chewing,


1206
0:59:26,17 --> 0:59:30,94
such things as moisture of the
ration, such things as grain levels, such


1207
0:59:30,94 --> 0:59:34,23
things a slugged feeding, such things as heat
stress, and


1208
0:59:34,23 --> 0:59:35,839
all these things pop in


1209
0:59:35,839 --> 0:59:38,73
that can have some impact on rumen
function and health. 


1210
0:59:38,73 --> 0:59:42,39
I know that list was fairly short as
far as that goes.


1211
0:59:42,39 --> 0:59:45,42
Got another quick question. We are burning 
through these offly fast. When I can't answer


1212
0:59:45,42 --> 0:59:46,599
one Dick and Dave I


1213
0:59:46,599 --> 0:59:50,509
will let you know. We
have a question that's coming in 


1214
0:59:50,509 --> 0:59:53,0
that is very specific.


1215
0:59:53,0 --> 0:59:57,25
It's a product that comes from Agri-King 
and we answer that it is called Rumimax 


1216
0:59:57,25 --> 1:0:1,59
verses Rumensin. Rumensin is an 
antibiotic so it actually selects


1217
1:0:1,59 --> 1:0:5,119
against the gram-positive
bacteria.


1218
1:0:5,119 --> 1:0:8,91
So, it's a microbial
inhibiter that david that's how you


1219
1:0:8,91 --> 1:0:10,88
trained it yesterday at this point


1220
1:0:10,88 --> 1:0:14,38
so that's what we're men's and that's
that's a blacks microbes and that meant


1221
1:0:14,38 --> 1:0:18,45
literally will decrease per pranic asset
which has to be fishes he built into it


1222
1:0:18,45 --> 1:0:22,77
and integrity works against a four-day
disconnect here is a small extent and


1223
1:0:22,77 --> 1:0:24,91
that's why sometimes you can see some
impact


1224
1:0:24,91 --> 1:0:29,319
in room and help the relax product gives
them of a combination of products out


1225
1:0:29,319 --> 1:0:32,89
there i'd think they have a they have
some uh... direct that micro goes in


1226
1:0:32,89 --> 1:0:36,849
there i think this and he's culture in
their i do not think they have ruins and


1227
1:0:36,849 --> 1:0:40,529
in their but then again i i'm not that
close the private what one is more of


1228
1:0:40,529 --> 1:0:44,39
the room and stimulate pet product the
other one is an antibiotic so that there


1229
1:0:44,39 --> 1:0:45,67
is there a vastly different


1230
1:0:45,67 --> 1:0:49,91
and if somebody wants to jump in on it
on the max they can we can really backed


1231
1:0:49,91 --> 1:0:53,46
another quick question how much corn
gluten kenya p animus court would


1232
1:0:53,46 --> 1:0:54,2
replace


1233
1:0:54,2 --> 1:0:58,73
my answer very simply as i gotta keep my
targeted start level and if i say that's


1234
1:0:58,73 --> 1:1:0,7
twenty four percent


1235
1:1:0,7 --> 1:1:3,46
but island target twenty four percent
starch and i've died and i will bring


1236
1:1:3,46 --> 1:1:6,62
inasmuch pollutants replace court as i
can


1237
1:1:6,62 --> 1:1:10,86
to maintain that that that number about
beating up like my colleague in illinois


1238
1:1:10,86 --> 1:1:15,36
heavy corn silage i'd probably to
replace all my corner of corn gluten at


1239
1:1:15,36 --> 1:1:19,76
the stage gave because i've got started
twenty eight thirty thirty two thirty


1240
1:1:19,76 --> 1:1:23,87
four percent starts coming from a corn
silage so basically that's how i would


1241
1:1:23,87 --> 1:1:28,4
go analysis be simple about we simply
say the formerly replaced after court


1242
1:1:28,4 --> 1:1:30,93
with corn gluten as a pretty safe thumb
rel


1243
1:1:30,93 --> 1:1:34,67
you can replace the backlash that we're
farmer in southern illinois i want him


1244
1:1:34,67 --> 1:1:38,699
is running out of course i was i think
what corn gluten is a no brainer


1245
1:1:38,699 --> 1:1:42,789
and so i would suggest in many places
all his corn silage with what corn


1246
1:1:42,789 --> 1:1:44,64
gluten feed assuming he can buy it


1247
1:1:44,64 --> 1:1:49,42
and its price for a t_v_ coastal resort
audit again watch such things as


1248
1:1:49,42 --> 1:1:53,319
particle size because now corn silage is
gone i'm losing some part of


1249
1:1:53,319 --> 1:1:56,719
the whole discussion be that here just a
bit earlier and went on as far as i a


1250
1:1:56,719 --> 1:1:57,589
course


1251
1:1:57,589 --> 1:1:59,609
and um...


1252
1:1:59,609 --> 1:2:1,819
and uh... i just have a comment uh... oh


1253
1:2:1,819 --> 1:2:4,76
uh... where no question that can we feed
a huge


1254
1:2:4,76 --> 1:2:8,96
quantity of corn side and summer day do
you wanna read your spot that kenai


1255
1:2:8,96 --> 1:2:10,869
kid we feed a huge


1256
1:2:10,869 --> 1:2:14,309
amount of corn silage in the summer


1257
1:2:14,309 --> 1:2:17,829
years i don't think there will be a
problem with that i think the key actor


1258
1:2:17,829 --> 1:2:19,29
shooter


1259
1:2:19,29 --> 1:2:24,579
pump life and make sure that uh... yeah
fresh ito paris new york deep two or


1260
1:2:24,579 --> 1:2:29,839
three times as a person on tax day but
certainly not the sport caledonian


1261
1:2:29,839 --> 1:2:32,609
intake it would be able to win


1262
1:2:32,609 --> 1:2:33,759
i would certainly


1263
1:2:33,759 --> 1:2:38,609
not be breaking boards monson coincides
like any other thoughts


1264
1:2:38,609 --> 1:2:41,559
i die i figured that shade the only
thing i would have to give it is that


1265
1:2:41,559 --> 1:2:45,76
the courts i think very high let yes it
is all for my smokestack stabilizer


1266
1:2:45,76 --> 1:2:49,41
i think and get away maybe a little with
a look at less risk of security mechanic


1267
1:2:49,41 --> 1:2:53,24
at all that lactic acid there's an it
might even help will what scares me is


1268
1:2:53,24 --> 1:2:56,809
my farmer runs out of court sized at a
temperature to be some degrees tomorrow


1269
1:2:56,809 --> 1:3:1,19
what a bad deal cut down picks up
probably his most stabilizing ingredient


1270
1:3:1,19 --> 1:3:4,759
is diet and and and and i was replacing
with something that that could be nearly


1271
1:3:4,759 --> 1:3:9,409
a stable with some in the front five six
seven percent lactic acid as far as i a


1272
1:3:9,409 --> 1:3:10,159
course


1273
1:3:10,159 --> 1:3:13,789
we have two comments from to our people
like this kind of fun actually they said


1274
1:3:13,789 --> 1:3:15,319
they're pretty confident now that that


1275
1:3:15,319 --> 1:3:19,449
kemon produce called t_m_ are saver
instead of when i called moultrie


1276
1:3:19,449 --> 1:3:22,559
herb or or barker over something like
that you can see i'm getting all i'm not


1277
1:3:22,559 --> 1:3:24,93
staying up today but i got that from two
different people


1278
1:3:24,93 --> 1:3:28,95
and new hampshire has the same functions
as far as that goes had another quick


1279
1:3:28,95 --> 1:3:30,64
question came in here about that


1280
1:3:30,64 --> 1:3:32,109
way arm


1281
1:3:32,109 --> 1:3:35,91
jemison uh... ways cheap how much we can
it be to pay for child


1282
1:3:35,91 --> 1:3:38,72
can it be ad lib their market will need
to be a


1283
1:3:38,72 --> 1:3:41,269
our number is that you could probably
speed


1284
1:3:41,269 --> 1:3:44,959
uh... wing is going to be chevrons on
the back in a two-way we say you can't


1285
1:3:44,959 --> 1:3:49,759
be probably about a camp out of town
have sugar to the rational way out


1286
1:3:49,759 --> 1:3:53,899
lactose bob's going to be a sugar
replacement as far as that goes so i'm


1287
1:3:53,899 --> 1:3:58,909
saying if you start adding about five
percent five percent


1288
1:3:58,909 --> 1:4:1,119
that's a bunch that's mug shots


1289
1:4:1,119 --> 1:4:3,369
i would add more like two four percent


1290
1:4:3,369 --> 1:4:8,849
two to four percent on a dry matter pace
too mighty ammar spark that caused it'll


1291
1:4:8,849 --> 1:4:13,619
go very very quickly could lead to be a
if i had to pass a bill says iraq amazed


1292
1:4:13,619 --> 1:4:17,669
to know if i ruined with with baby dead
point to fill factor and i drop it some


1293
1:4:17,669 --> 1:4:22,219
really fast real carbohydrate um...
meyer of processes question he ap i i


1294
1:4:22,219 --> 1:4:23,95
think it could cost them ph


1295
1:4:23,95 --> 1:4:25,68
just because of the weapon this


1296
1:4:25,68 --> 1:4:29,329
of the fermentation profile so i have
the room another aaj and it's kinda like


1297
1:4:29,329 --> 1:4:34,2
say well contract the eggs too much
corvette club the d_a_ well academically


1298
1:4:34,2 --> 1:4:37,779
dole but if it's the wrong situation you
better believe it supposedly a saving


1299
1:4:37,779 --> 1:4:41,21
what the hell it will with the wayside
take two to four percent by the way of


1300
1:4:41,21 --> 1:4:46,27
ways cheap and and it is getting quite a
bit cheaper then i would go him and look


1301
1:4:46,27 --> 1:4:49,4
at that also has a great additive for my
image


1302
1:4:49,4 --> 1:4:53,74
if you want to put a_t_f_ nutrients are
said to him to make it really for men a


1303
1:4:53,74 --> 1:4:57,26
larger you're not doing are at about ten
percent


1304
1:4:57,26 --> 1:5:2,14
way dried weight to or even liquid way
and holy smoker those bacteria think


1305
1:5:2,14 --> 1:5:5,65
they'd i'd like to have it because they
got all that sugar in their te llamo


1306
1:5:5,65 --> 1:5:7,99
like might you be and many of the spark
that caused


1307
1:5:7,99 --> 1:5:12,46
our colleague espy deny levels all bar
court here in illinois came back and


1308
1:5:12,46 --> 1:5:12,98
said


1309
1:5:12,98 --> 1:5:18,79
he speedy about uh... four pounds uh...
if we don't eat four pounds of corn he


1310
1:5:18,79 --> 1:5:19,359
says


1311
1:5:19,359 --> 1:5:23,599
the man or starz a stepping up so he set
he can't replace all his core but


1312
1:5:23,599 --> 1:5:24,299
obviously


1313
1:5:24,299 --> 1:5:27,649
that's a lot less than camp over
fourteen pounds at many farmers would


1314
1:5:27,649 --> 1:5:28,269
feed


1315
1:5:28,269 --> 1:5:29,619
at this point


1316
1:5:29,619 --> 1:5:34,39
another quick question came in here and
i don't want reading racism ego takeoff


1317
1:5:34,39 --> 1:5:39,109
assign office park that caused canyon
venad dry corn gluten feed along with


1318
1:5:39,109 --> 1:5:40,59
two thirds ailish


1319
1:5:40,59 --> 1:5:42,41
one-third karzai space diet


1320
1:5:42,41 --> 1:5:46,229
we discern about too much time bull
protein


1321
1:5:46,229 --> 1:5:47,23
yeah i think you can


1322
1:5:47,23 --> 1:5:50,439
yeah i think you uh... e dilip


1323
1:5:50,439 --> 1:5:51,91
new york communicative


1324
1:5:51,91 --> 1:5:56,459
uh... two-thirds eulogy in my view idea
to do the jump in with me rather enough


1325
1:5:56,459 --> 1:5:56,799
here


1326
1:5:56,799 --> 1:5:59,4
two-thirds hedge almost always have to
assign a protein


1327
1:5:59,4 --> 1:6:2,539
and that's one reason to go the higher
court sized added diets because we get


1328
1:6:2,539 --> 1:6:6,499
our months about and we we can bring in
the right of the glasses to compliment


1329
1:6:6,499 --> 1:6:11,599
of the profiles grief microbes from the
corn silage spark that goals so i i i


1330
1:6:11,599 --> 1:6:16,66
would say yes it is and yes um... or
gluten feed us have side of a protein so


1331
1:6:16,66 --> 1:6:18,529
the answer is yes


1332
1:6:18,529 --> 1:6:22,189
uh... i understand and i say hi change
your life you keep because now you're


1333
1:6:22,189 --> 1:6:24,41
telling me i should use corn because
it's cheap


1334
1:6:24,41 --> 1:6:28,669
and so the question is do i uh... once
an environmental concerns that are used


1335
1:6:28,669 --> 1:6:32,4
farm and i say that california and what
you trouble like that


1336
1:6:32,4 --> 1:6:34,53
our president the blue that last night
on


1337
1:6:34,53 --> 1:6:36,859
uh... talk show but the point is


1338
1:6:36,859 --> 1:6:40,13
uh... we're going to make some decisions
in the next couple months ect maybe


1339
1:6:40,13 --> 1:6:42,289
environmentally are quite silent


1340
1:6:42,289 --> 1:6:44,91
or make maybe we wouldn't do uh... if it


1341
1:6:44,91 --> 1:6:48,71
but at this point if i can save twenty
cents a colony but maybe just enough to


1342
1:6:48,71 --> 1:6:52,329
keep me in the very best given any
comments on the sidewalk protein looking


1343
1:6:52,329 --> 1:6:52,71
at


1344
1:6:52,71 --> 1:6:55,519
at those kinds of peas did you hear what
i said


1345
1:6:55,519 --> 1:7:1,129
anger or just a reminder superiors
leaves at this point


1346
1:7:1,129 --> 1:7:4,539
okay why don't we go all the answers all
the questionnaire from this point if


1347
1:7:4,539 --> 1:7:6,45
after one o'clock my apologies


1348
1:7:6,45 --> 1:7:9,43
running along at this stage the games
yet we don't work what job


1349
1:7:9,43 --> 1:7:13,34
uh... dead equality bay fish thanks very
much for joining us we thank you for


1350
1:7:13,34 --> 1:7:17,96
many participants set aside in here
today are great questions we came in and


1351
1:7:17,96 --> 1:7:23,23
uh... we hope we'll see something about
theorist in uh... uh the eight of bob


1352
1:7:23,23 --> 1:7:24,769
it broken with um...


1353
1:7:24,769 --> 1:7:27,13
the title looking at d replacement helm


1354
1:7:27,13 --> 1:7:28,829
heifer webinars so until then


1355
1:7:28,829 --> 1:7:31,979
we're gonna sign off and uh... jim
what's gonna happen are we going to get


1356
1:7:31,979 --> 1:7:33,699
the values


1357
1:7:33,699 --> 1:7:37,41
altigen said you're going to get a
survey epic and when you sign off it's


1358
1:7:37,41 --> 1:7:38,919
about pop right up


1359
1:7:38,919 --> 1:7:42,279
so it's not a common in the outskirts
will keep you signed off ops you hear me


1360
1:7:42,279 --> 1:7:45,929
anymore but you're gonna get a survey
that will 


1361
1:7:45,929 --> 1:7:49,249
take a minute and send it back to us. It's got
about 2 or 3 questions we'd like


1362
1:7:49,249 --> 1:7:53,299
to learn a bit more about what'd you
think and man are we signing off. So, if you


1363
1:7:53,299 --> 1:7:56,609
have a chance give me another minute to
sign off at this stage. 


1364

Jim, thank you very much to you and Luann
and to Jen for your support


1365
1:7:59,84 --> 1:8:3,42
and given the source run out and will be
curious to hopefully here


1366
1:8:3,42 --> 1:10:3,42
how it worked out. I understand we had a
couple of glitches.
