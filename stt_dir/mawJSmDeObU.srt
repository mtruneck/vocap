1
0:1:57,471 --> 0:2:3,151
Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something.


2
0:2:3,151 --> 0:2:9,871
What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life.


3
0:2:9,871 --> 0:2:13,271
That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is,


4
0:2:13,271 --> 0:2:19,872
but itís there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad.


5
0:2:19,872 --> 0:2:22,732
It is this feeling that has brought you to me.


6
0:2:22,732 --> 0:2:28,32
This is your last chance, after this there's no turning back.


7
0:2:28,32 --> 0:2:33,132
You take the blue bill, the story ends you wake up in your bed and believe


8
0:2:33,132 --> 0:2:38,542
whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland


9
0:2:38,542 --> 0:2:52,93
and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.


10
0:2:52,93 --> 0:3:10,934
Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.


11
0:3:10,934 --> 0:3:14,55
Follow me.


12
0:3:14,55 --> 0:3:20,855
This isn't real. 
What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about


13
0:3:20,855 --> 0:3:25,505
what you can feel what you can smell what you can taste and see then real


14
0:3:25,505 --> 0:3:29,65
is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.


15
0:3:29,65 --> 0:3:36,266
It's all about frequency compatibility, vibrational compatibility. If you are in a human


16
0:3:36,266 --> 0:3:42,326
body and you're vibrating to a certain frequency um and here someone wants


17
0:3:42,326 --> 0:3:47,66
to possess that body and is vibrating to a very different frequency, it's very


18
0:3:47,66 --> 0:3:51,307
difficult to make that connection and therefore takeover the mental and emotional


19
0:3:51,307 --> 0:4:0,577
faculties of that human body if you like. If you can create a genetic hybrid


20
0:4:0,577 --> 0:4:5,458
then that vibrational compatibility becomes very much closer and therefore


21
0:4:5,458 --> 0:4:10,998
very much more effective in terms of possession. So what has happened is


22
0:4:10,998 --> 0:4:16,128
there has been this interbreeding which created these hybrid bloodlines and


23
0:4:16,128 --> 0:4:21,478
this is the origin of the divine right to rule. The divine right to rule "what is that?"


24
0:4:21,478 --> 0:4:27,79
It's the right to rule because of your bloodline because of your DNA. So these


25
0:4:27,79 --> 0:4:36,659
hybrids became known  and their known in history as the demi-gods, part human part gods.


26
0:4:36,659 --> 0:4:40,67
Gods were just other dimensional entities. And they became the kings the queens,


27
0:4:40,67 --> 0:4:47,63
the emperors of the ancient world. Who claim this right because of their special bloodline


28
0:4:47,63 --> 0:4:53,48
Royal dictatorship started to be resisted by the people and the royal dictatorship


29
0:4:53,48 --> 0:5:1,331
started to fall. What happened is these bloodlines moved out of overt royal


30
0:5:1,331 --> 0:5:4,961
dictatorship. They're still in there, the Winsorís in Britain and the Spanish


31
0:5:4,961 --> 0:5:9,721
royal family and all these others. But they moved then into what I call the


32
0:5:9,721 --> 0:5:13,211
dark suit professions as they've become. They moved into politics, they moved into


33
0:5:13,211 --> 0:5:17,252
banking and business and all this stuff. They're in there anyway but they moved in much more


34
0:5:17,252 --> 0:5:21,472
powerfully. So when you look at the transnational corporations and the major


35
0:5:21,472 --> 0:5:27,992
and most powerful and influential politicians, and those that control the oil cartel, and the drug


36
0:5:27,992 --> 0:5:33,372
cartel and all the rest of it, you're looking at this hybrid bloodlines. In effect, it's a software program


37
0:5:33,372 --> 0:5:38,863
if you want to see the body as a computer as I do. And you want to know who they


38
0:5:38,863 --> 0:5:44,694
are because you know if you got this bloodline itís like a computer program


39
0:5:44,694 --> 0:5:49,764
or a computer in the sense that you got files in your computer but they donít affect the screen


40
0:5:49,764 --> 0:5:56,914
the reality unless you open the file. So you go through life and these files don't affect you,


41
0:5:56,914 --> 0:6:3,105
but there are certain ways that you can open these files and then bring that perception, that attitude


42
0:6:3,105 --> 0:6:12,935
that behavior that personality of that file onto the screen. In other words, in the way


43
0:6:12,935 --> 0:6:19,65
people behave in everyday life. And they do this with the secret society ritual.


44
0:6:19,65 --> 0:6:22,966
This is why they'll target someone, the person won't realize why they've been targeted.


45
0:6:22,966 --> 0:6:27,206
They might thing that "Oh they just think I'm good and they're supporting me


46
0:6:27,206 --> 0:6:33,606
and sponsoring me." Powerful people suddenly sponsors people to progress


47
0:6:33,606 --> 0:6:39,67
very quickly in law or politics, or stuff. People like Blair is a classic.


48
0:6:39,67 --> 0:6:48,207
And then as they progress through this sponsorship and support, they get pulled


49
0:6:48,207 --> 0:6:51,517
into the secret society network is all part of it, and then they go through


50
0:6:51,517 --> 0:6:56,648
the secret society initiation rituals which often they have not a clue what they're about.


51
0:6:56,648 --> 0:7:1,488
They're just rituals are they. Just tradition. But what's happening is these rituals


52
0:7:1,488 --> 0:7:4,648
that are designed to tease open these files which they know they've got cause


53
0:7:4,648 --> 0:7:8,988
they've got the bloodline in there. And then as these files open so they have more


54
0:7:8,988 --> 0:7:14,368
and more effect on the personality, the screen of the person involved and there personality


55
0:7:14,368 --> 0:7:21,639
changes. And you watch this classic example, you can see it around the world. You


56
0:7:21,639 --> 0:7:27,729
watch people who for instance come into politics with a certain sometimes genuine


57
0:7:27,729 --> 0:7:38,549
desire to change things and then eventually, as they progress into power, they


58
0:7:38,549 --> 0:7:46,63
become absolutely everything that they entered politics to challenge. And It's


59
0:7:46,63 --> 0:7:52,91
not always for this reason, but many times it is this reason that as this genetic


60
0:7:52,91 --> 0:7:57,341
files have been opened, more and more and more, suddenly it's affecting their


61
0:7:57,341 --> 0:8:4,62
personality and they're now becoming a behavioral perception expression of this


62
0:8:4,62 --> 0:8:10,972
hybrid DNA. And they start to operate with that hybrid DNA in terms of their behavior


63
0:8:10,972 --> 0:8:19,502
and attitudes. DNA databases now allow a highly sophisticated way of finding out


64
0:8:19,502 --> 0:8:24,792
who's got the bloodline and who hasn't. Everybody is broadcasting, vibrating


65
0:8:24,792 --> 0:8:29,613
to a certain frequency. Were in the same frequency range, otherwise we couldn't


66
0:8:29,613 --> 0:8:33,953
see each other, but there's subtle differences between everybody, we always have


67
0:8:33,953 --> 0:8:40,643
our unique vibrational code. If you know what that code is, and if you want


68
0:8:40,643 --> 0:8:45,403
target that person with vibrational interference on a physical, emotional and


69
0:8:45,403 --> 0:8:51,704
mental level, mind control I'm talking about with the latter one. Then you can target


70
0:8:51,704 --> 0:8:57,574
them specifically on their unique frequency. Once you have the DNA you can


71
0:8:57,574 --> 0:9:3,435
work out what that frequency is, so that's another reason why they want


72
0:9:3,435 --> 0:9:9,525
DNA database. It's not for catching criminals, they arenít interested in catching


73
0:9:9,525 --> 0:9:14,536
criminals. Criminals for them are just other ways, the highest level I'm


74
0:9:14,536 --> 0:9:17,335
talking about, are just other ways to justify more and more control to protect


75
0:9:17,335 --> 0:9:20,365
the people from criminals. They don't want a society that without crime without


76
0:9:20,365 --> 0:9:26,296
violence without terrorism, is worst nightmare. How do you impose an Orwellian


77
0:9:26,296 --> 0:9:31,977
State on a society of harmony? You can't do it. You can only do it on a society that


78
0:9:31,977 --> 0:9:36,27
is divided and ruled and in fear of everything. That's why we have the society we do.


79
0:9:36,27 --> 0:9:43,147
Watch US television fawning Fox CNN CBS all of them ìOH it's so wonderful, no one in America


80
0:9:43,147 --> 0:9:51,767
can wait until next week." The way they're hyping it.


81
0:9:51,767 --> 0:9:53,928
One week until the royal wedding this is an exciting stuff I mean itís hard to


82
0:9:53,928 --> 0:9:56,87
I mean the energy is just palpable.


83
0:9:56,87 --> 0:9:59,368
Young couples get married they're just hoping that some bank will be nice enough to


84
0:9:59,368 --> 0:10:2,238
give them a mortgage. These folks have a number of palaces to pick from.


85
0:10:2,238 --> 0:10:6,798
NBC news is launching a free Royal Wedding App for the I pad.


86
0:10:6,798 --> 0:10:11,378
This is truly a love story that captures everybody's attention.


87
0:10:11,378 --> 0:10:16,639
This goes back to Edward Bernays a hundred years ago saying look, to make politicians


88
0:10:16,639 --> 0:10:20,769
and royalty popular we'll have Hollywood stars come to banquets and events with them.


89
0:10:20,769 --> 0:10:24,699
We'll have music stars, we'll have other people go there to basically make these


90
0:10:24,699 --> 0:10:52,301
elites be seen as celebrities themselves.


91
0:10:52,301 --> 0:10:56,682
In the books of the Tibetan Contour


92
0:10:56,682 --> 0:11:1,261
The contour consists of over a thousand volumes containing the holy texts of


93
0:11:1,261 --> 0:11:7,682
Lamaism. The resulting translations are full of references to gods appearing in the sky. Of aluminous


94
0:11:7,682 --> 0:11:12,142
pearls and transparent spheres in which they lived.


95
0:11:12,142 --> 0:11:18,633
The search for humanities first possible contact with alien beings in prehistoric times leads


96
0:11:18,633 --> 0:11:25,813
to an unlikely place, to the bibles earliest chapters, to the book of Genesis.


97
0:11:25,813 --> 0:11:31,863
There were giants in the Earth in those days. And also after that when the sons of God


98
0:11:31,863 --> 0:11:41,864
came into the daughters of men and they bore children to them. Genesis 6-4


99
0:11:41,864 --> 0:11:50,304
While most English bibles use the word giants, the original Hebrew word is Nephilim.


100
0:11:50,304 --> 0:11:58,355
In translation of the word Nephilim is the men who came down or those who came down meaning


101
0:11:58,355 --> 0:12:5,15
those who came down from the sky. So it may not mean that they are physical giants. They


102
0:12:5,15 --> 0:12:11,536
could just be something like great heroes that came down from the sky and produced a hybrid race.


103
0:12:11,536 --> 0:12:17,386
If you say that Jehovah is an ET then that changes the basis of Judaism and Christianity


104
0:12:17,386 --> 0:12:19,746
in a very fundamental way.


105
0:12:19,746 --> 0:12:25,567
For many ancient Christians the book of Enoch was essential yet it was banned from the


106
0:12:25,567 --> 0:12:27,207
Christian bible.


107
0:12:27,207 --> 0:12:32,457
We don't know why this literature was ultimately excluded from the canon perhaps itís because


108
0:12:32,457 --> 0:12:39,387
of its description of the fall of the rebel angels and their mating with mortals. Perhaps


109
0:12:39,387 --> 0:12:46,688
it's understanding of the End of Time fell out of favor with Jews and Christians.


110
0:12:46,688 --> 0:12:52,418
As with the story in Genesis, God blames this evil on the sons of God. Angels who


111
0:12:52,418 --> 0:12:55,328
lusted over the daughters of man.


112
0:12:55,328 --> 0:13:0,8
These angels are sometimes referred to as watchers they keep constant watch and they decide


113
0:13:0,8 --> 0:13:6,248
one day, about 200 of them that theyíre going to descend to the Earth.


114
0:13:6,248 --> 0:13:13,629
They would like to very much make contact with these mortal women.


115
0:13:13,629 --> 0:13:17,919
The book of Enoch may have been an attempt to expand on the mysteries giants, the sons


116
0:13:17,919 --> 0:13:23,7
of God and the daughters of the Earth spoken of in Genesis.


117
0:13:23,7 --> 0:13:27,58
Anytime you read the book of Genesis there are all kinds of unanswered questions


118
0:13:27,58 --> 0:13:32,24
Suddenly there is this quick few verses in the beginning of the flood story about giants in the


119
0:13:32,24 --> 0:13:37,66
land that come from the sons of God mixing with the daughters of the Earth and you stop and


120
0:13:37,66 --> 0:13:42,851
think wait a minute what's this all about. It's like it went by too fast and you want to grab it


121
0:13:42,851 --> 0:13:44,63
and say wait a minute what was this.


122
0:13:44,63 --> 0:13:53,741
And they began to go into them and defile themselves with them and taught them charms


123
0:13:53,741 --> 0:13:57,192
and enchantments. And they became pregnant and they bore great giants who's height was


124
0:13:57,192 --> 0:14:1,792
three thousand elves. And when men could no longer sustain them the giants turned against


125
0:14:1,792 --> 0:14:10,373
the men devoured mankind.


126
0:14:10,373 --> 0:14:14,412
That these angels had crossed this boundary that they shouldn't have when they decided


127
0:14:14,412 --> 0:14:18,393
to descend upon Earth, this unleashed upon the Earth all sorts of problems. Not only


128
0:14:18,393 --> 0:14:23,363
these giants who are blood-thirsty and violent but also these angel went on to teach human


129
0:14:23,363 --> 0:14:30,203
kind a variety of forbidden crafts. They also taught human beings how to make weapons of war.


130
0:14:30,203 --> 0:14:35,974
The Maya and Incas of South America believed a race of giants existed on Earth before the


131
0:14:35,974 --> 0:14:44,694
great flood. So did many other ancient civilizations. Some took them for gods others left


132
0:14:44,694 --> 0:14:49,64
likenesses of them in stone or wrote about them in their histories.


133
0:14:49,64 --> 0:14:55,615
As long as six thousand years ago another remarkable civilization evolved. It's people were the


134
0:14:55,615 --> 0:15:0,185
Sumerians who had an extraordinarily advanced culture.


135
0:15:0,185 --> 0:15:8,205
There lists of first just almost sounds like a whole list of our whole society. They had the first


136
0:15:8,205 --> 0:15:13,246
bicameral congress, they had the first writings, they had the first school systems and you know


137
0:15:13,246 --> 0:15:20,77
and you just go on and on and on. So you have to ask where did all this come from and I think


138
0:15:20,77 --> 0:15:25,147
that you need to turn to the ancient Sumerians themselves and listen very carefully to what they


139
0:15:25,147 --> 0:15:30,807
have to say because what they have to say not just in one place but over and over and over again


140
0:15:30,807 --> 0:15:38,828
is that they were taught civilization by these beings that came from the heavens to the Earth


141
0:15:38,828 --> 0:15:46,408
And the pictorial evidence left behind by the Sumerians going back six thousand years speak and


142
0:15:46,408 --> 0:15:55,269
depict a people who came from another planet I call Nibiru. And many of the depictions show


143
0:15:55,269 --> 0:16:5,979
them much bigger at least by a third more than the average human beings so they were giants.


144
0:16:5,979 --> 0:16:12,65
This Sumerian cylinder seal is astonishing for several reasons.


145
0:16:12,65 --> 0:16:18,96
First it depicts our solar system with the sun at the center and planets arrayed around it.


146
0:16:18,96 --> 0:16:24,32
A fact not known to European science until around 300 years ago.


147
0:16:24,32 --> 0:16:30,231
And amazingly there's another planet, which the Sumerians called Nibiru and believed that it


148
0:16:30,231 --> 0:16:35,301
was from where the Anunaki or celestial giants came from.


149
0:16:35,301 --> 0:16:43,651
The ancient Sumerian text in a very broad overview basically tell us that more than 400 thousand


150
0:16:43,651 --> 0:16:52,31
years ago that these Anunaki came from space and landed on the Earth in the Tigers Ufraties valley.


151
0:16:52,31 --> 0:16:59,112
They began to set up a colony that they called E-den.


152
0:16:59,112 --> 0:17:6,333
According to Genesis, E-den or Eden is where Adam was created from dust and Eve from one


153
0:17:6,333 --> 0:17:15,623
of his ribs. Others however have a more hi-tech version of how human life began.


154
0:17:15,623 --> 0:17:24,204
In time needing men-power needing workers jumped the gun on evolution using genetic


155
0:17:24,204 --> 0:17:28,613
engineering
and they produced a hybrid.


156
0:17:28,613 --> 0:17:33,594
Legend has it that when the Anunaki came back after several thousand years to see how


157
0:17:33,594 --> 0:17:42,65
their genetic handiwork had turned out, they found the Earth females irresistibly attractive.


158
0:17:42,65 --> 0:17:48,835
Thatís us. Basically the Anunaki said in their writings that the Sumerians left behind, we should make


159
0:17:48,835 --> 0:17:54,25
the Adamove, they called their slave servant Adamove plural which comes to us now in the


160
0:17:54,25 --> 0:17:59,346
bible as the Adam. We should make the Adamove in our own image after our own likeness and


161
0:17:59,346 --> 0:18:5,306
they did that
Now wait a minute are you saying that we


162
0:18:5,306 --> 0:18:9,336
the modern race of people were genetically engineered by a super-human race of aliens


163
0:18:9,336 --> 0:18:14,86
that came from another planet
and that we look like them. In the cylinder seals


164
0:18:14,86 --> 0:18:18,416
that we have the five thousand or so cylinder seals that we have out of the Sumerian culture


165
0:18:18,416 --> 0:18:23,587
depicting gods and humans on the same cylinder seal at the same time they always look


166
0:18:23,587 --> 0:18:29,817
the same. How did we lose 2 chromosomes all primates have 48 chromosomes we have 46


167
0:18:29,817 --> 0:18:34,748
that is an awful a lot of DNA where did it.. if you read the Sumerian text the Anunaki flourished


168
0:18:34,748 --> 0:18:39,767
from around 400 thousand years ago and by the way they called their where they lived in the Tigers


169
0:18:39,767 --> 0:18:44,648
Ufratis valley the E-den. That was their word for where they lived


170
0:18:44,648 --> 0:18:47,598
Well we've heard Adam and we've heard Eden.


171
0:18:47,598 --> 0:18:52,48
Well it turns out a lot of the old testament is an attempt to rewrite the Sumerian Epics


172
0:18:52,48 --> 0:18:55,588
of creation cause they were considered the guys with the word.


173
0:18:55,588 --> 0:18:56,738
We have to break here.


174
0:18:56,738 --> 0:19:3,389
And these ancient cultures they all have their stories of this interbreeding between a


175
0:19:3,389 --> 0:19:9,989
reptilian race, and itís not all reptilian but it seems to be a predominant factor, and humans.


176
0:19:9,989 --> 0:19:16,93
In fact, the ancient emperors of China used to claim the right to be emperor because of their


177
0:19:16,93 --> 0:19:23,6
descendants from the serpent gods. Everywhere you find this reference in different phrases and names


178
0:19:23,6 --> 0:19:26,281
to the serpent gods.


179
0:19:26,281 --> 0:19:36,151
And out of here the Sumer, Egypt, Babylon area came some of the most significant bloodlines


180
0:19:36,151 --> 0:22:53,82
which then moved up across the world to become the ruling controlling families of today.


181
0:22:53,82 --> 0:23:0,163
In 1851 in what is now known as Iraq, archeologist and explorer Sir Austin Henry Leyard


182
0:23:0,163 --> 0:23:5,93
discovered a library of 22 thousand tablets containing what know to be the earliest writings


183
0:23:5,93 --> 0:23:9,733
on Earth. The writings date back to over 6 thousand years ago when the region was known as


184
0:23:9,733 --> 0:23:14,944
Mesopotamia, Sumer, and Babylon. Amongst these vast writings is a story that mirrors


185
0:23:14,944 --> 0:23:19,574
the book of Genesis in the bible. It tells a story of a great flood which reshaped the face of


186
0:23:19,574 --> 0:23:24,503
the planet Earth and all her inhabitants. It tells a story of a tower built at the creation of


187
0:23:24,503 --> 0:23:25,894
the spoken word.


188
0:23:25,894 --> 0:23:32,524
In Japan emperors claim decent from dragon gods that came from the sky. Australian aborigines


189
0:23:32,524 --> 0:23:38,249
teach of a reptilian race that lives underneath the Earth and governs over man. They believe they are


190
0:23:38,249 --> 0:23:44,619
descendants of a race of dragon humans. China teaches the serpent queen Nukua interbred with man


191
0:23:44,619 --> 0:23:51,76
India calls these reptilian gods Nagas, and claim they seeded their royal families. Throughout


192
0:23:51,76 --> 0:23:56,434
the middle east it is believed a serpent race created man. The book of Genesis tells of giants


193
0:23:56,434 --> 0:24:1,285
who came from the heavens to breed with the daughters of man. There called the Niphilim.


194
0:24:1,285 --> 0:24:6,565
In Africa they call them Chitari, children of the serpent.


195
0:24:6,565 --> 0:24:12,226
The royal kings of Africa claim decent from serpent gods who came from the sky.


196
0:24:12,226 --> 0:24:17,346
In South America the Mayans teach that their ancestors were the people of the serpent.


197
0:24:17,346 --> 0:24:20,386
Aztecs were said to be created by a serpent woman.


198
0:24:20,386 --> 0:24:26,157
In America the Hopi Indians believe sky gods came to Earth to breed with their women and


199
0:24:26,157 --> 0:24:34,546
refer to them as their snake brothers. The word Su means snakes, and iracoi means serpents


200
0:24:34,546 --> 0:24:39,417
It seems the only places you will not find this historical story is where the history has been


201
0:24:39,417 --> 0:24:43,148
methodically destroyed.


202
0:24:43,148 --> 0:24:49,918
The descendants from king Anu in Sumeria and Babylon can be traced throughout time.


203
0:24:49,918 --> 0:24:55,938
The pharaohs of Egypt were from the bloodlines of the Babylonian kings. The rulers of the


204
0:24:55,938 --> 0:25:3,568
Roman Empire can be traced to Egyptian hierarchy. All throughout Europe the royal families


205
0:25:3,568 --> 0:25:10,249
can be traced back to the great roman emperors. 34 of the presidents of the United


206
0:25:10,249 --> 0:25:14,629
States are directly descendant from European royalty with the remaining 8 who are only closely


207
0:25:14,629 --> 0:25:20,69
related to these same bloodlines. In 1934 president Franklin D Roosevelt placed the great


208
0:25:20,69 --> 0:25:26,189
seal originally created in 1782 by the freemasons, on the dollar bill. Represented in the great


209
0:25:26,189 --> 0:25:33,9
seal is the pyramid and the all seeing eye known to be used by the illusive society the Illuminati


210
0:25:33,9 --> 0:25:38,26
Strung together in conspiratorial confusion are secret societies such as the Illuminati, the freemasons


211
0:25:38,26 --> 0:25:45,53
and the bohemian club. In 1917 national geographic did a story on a place in Monte Rio California


212
0:25:45,53 --> 0:25:51,571
called Bohemian Grove. The story reports a place where worldís elite members of the Bohemian


213
0:25:51,571 --> 0:25:58,292
Club retreat to in late July and conduct and ancient occult ceremony called the cremation of care.


214
0:25:58,292 --> 0:26:3,581
The alter is at the base of a 200 foot owl the Babylonian symbol of the god Molech, the god of


215
0:26:3,581 --> 0:26:10,242
human sacrifice. In the video, a body is delivered up river where it is set on fire.


216
0:26:10,242 --> 0:26:15,522
Upon being aired members of the bohemian club reported that the ceremony is a put-on


217
0:26:15,522 --> 0:26:20,653
merely done for entertainment and fun. This history tells a story of our world leaders having


218
0:26:20,653 --> 0:26:28,234
a deep involvement in Satanic tradition, worshiping our reptilian overloads, serpent gods.


219
0:26:28,234 --> 0:26:33,525
It poses the possibility that we may be and have always been enslaved by our leaders


220
0:26:33,525 --> 0:26:39,145
no different than sheep or cattle. There is an endless amount of information that supports


221
0:26:39,145 --> 0:26:42,416
this. But donít take my word for it.


222
0:26:42,416 --> 0:26:46,785
Members of the major religious organizations, how are they conspiring together towards a


223
0:26:46,785 --> 0:26:55,146
global agenda, in your opinion
 Well I donít think that 99.9% of people in the religions are conspiring


224
0:26:55,146 --> 0:27:2,657
together, but if you go high enough to those that ultimately control those religions thatís when the


225
0:27:2,657 --> 0:27:14,57
conspiracy comes in. And very very few understand those connections because it's essential to the


226
0:27:14,57 --> 0:27:23,888
conspiracy unfolding unchallenged for even those that are making contributions to it everyday


227
0:27:23,888 --> 0:27:30,428
not to realize that thatís what theyíre doing. So they structure everything and religion is exactly


228
0:27:30,428 --> 0:27:37,379
the same, as pyramids compartmentalized pyramids. So if you look at the any organization today


229
0:27:37,379 --> 0:27:43,216
including Christianity or Islam or any of it, theyíre structured as pyramids and pyramids within pyramids


230
0:27:43,216 --> 0:27:51,146
so the vast majority are in the body of the pyramid and they have been manipulated to believe that


231
0:27:51,146 --> 0:27:58,987
their religion is true and their God is the only God, and all that stuff. And their truth is the only truth


232
0:27:58,987 --> 0:28:4,17
and everyone else must be wrong and then you keep going up and up and up and up and right at the top


233
0:28:4,17 --> 0:28:10,937
of the pyramid you got the tiny few people who are actually orchestrating the whole deal. And they understand


234
0:28:10,937 --> 0:28:20,328
that the religion the religious belief in whatever religion it is, is just a front for something else.


235
0:28:20,328 --> 0:28:31,319
And that something else is the something else behind all at least all the major religion a lot of the non-


236
0:28:31,319 --> 0:28:40,139
major religions, so Christianity and Islam and Judaism and all that stuff ultimately come from the same


237
0:28:40,139 --> 0:28:48,49
source and are controlled by the same source. So if you go back to the ancient world and you pick up the


238
0:28:48,49 --> 0:28:57,1
sun-god moon-goddess religion which was predominant around the world you will have Christians


239
0:28:57,1 --> 0:29:6,6
and Muslims and stuff that would reject them, the goddess sun god religion that actually their religions


240
0:29:6,6 --> 0:29:15,852
are just another version of it. There just hidden behind different names and behind different structures


241
0:29:15,852 --> 0:29:22,702
but behind itís the same thing. If you look at the way they depicted for instances just a throw away thing,


242
0:29:22,702 --> 0:29:31,802
the way they depicted the sun-god and the moon-goddess in the middle east thousands of years ago


243
0:29:31,802 --> 0:29:39,393
itís the international symbol of Islam today, the moon and the star the sun. if you look at the background to


244
0:29:39,393 --> 0:29:48,663
Christianity you see that Jesus was just another version of the sun god like mythra and tamos in Babylon, and


245
0:29:48,663 --> 0:29:55,954
so many others dyonisis, Bacchus, the same story was told about them thousands of years before Christianity


246
0:29:55,954 --> 0:30:1,764
that was told about Jesus, they've just put the story in another historical setting and changed the names.


247
0:30:1,764 --> 0:30:10,954
And Jesus is a symbol for the sun, this is why what was said about him and the way he's depicted is a mirror


248
0:30:10,954 --> 0:30:18,585
of the way they depicted Horus, the symbol of the sun in ancient Egypt. How they did for Tamus, symbol of the


249
0:30:18,585 --> 0:30:29,476
sun in ancient Babylon. And wherever you go you find that these religions are different versions of the sun-god


250
0:30:29,476 --> 0:30:38,36
moon-goddess religion which is the religion of those who are conspiring to bring about this Orwellian state.


251
0:30:38,36 --> 0:30:46,527
Then you go a step further and you look into these rituals in freemasonry and the background to freemasonry


252
0:30:46,527 --> 0:30:55,577
and other secret societies that connect into it. Like the Jesuits etc.,  just look at the Jesuits logo itís a sun.


253
0:30:55,577 --> 0:31:4,968
And you find again and again in freemasonry that one of their prime symbols if not the prime symbol is the sun.


254
0:31:4,968 --> 0:31:14,28
And so what you're looking at within the secret societies is another version of the ancient sun-god moon-goddess


255
0:31:14,28 --> 0:31:22,439
religion which is their focus of worship, which is the same focus of worship when you look behind the cover


256
0:31:22,439 --> 0:31:29,489
story of these major religions, and yet the major religions certainly Christianity on the surface condemn


257
0:31:29,489 --> 0:31:39,599
freemasonry and all that stuff, and yet theyíre all different masks on the same face, and so again when you


258
0:31:39,599 --> 0:31:47,43
take the pyramids up, the compartmentalized pyramid, and you reach the top you find that the same few


259
0:31:47,43 --> 0:31:56,641
what they call elite families, interbreeding families, bloodlines are controlling Christianity, Judaism, Islam, freemasonry


260
0:31:56,641 --> 0:32:8,262
Hinduism, you look at Hinduism again they are worshiping the same gods from the Vedic history as is


261
0:32:8,262 --> 0:32:18,262
worshiped in other forms by the western religions. And so itís one religion including the secret societies


262
0:32:18,262 --> 0:32:26,652
but the religions at the base of the pyramid where people see them in society are presented in different


263
0:32:26,652 --> 0:32:33,522
a way but itís all the same score and its all the same gods that they are and you know you go back to


264
0:32:33,522 --> 0:32:40,615
the original writings for the bible itís not talking about a singular god that came in the translation, they're


265
0:32:40,615 --> 0:32:52,896
talking about gods, and so are the Hindu religions and all the rest of it. So were looking at the same structure


266
0:32:52,896 --> 0:33:0,476
in belief and worship thatís packaged in different ways. And Of course once you re-package it, then you can play


267
0:33:0,476 --> 0:33:5,386
the different packages off against each other, dividing and rule the general population as religions


268
0:33:5,386 --> 0:33:10,647
fight and they argue and all this stuff over whoís right and i got the truth and you've not got the truth,


269
0:33:10,647 --> 0:33:16,797
And up there theyíre on their kind of on their backs with their legs in the air absolutely in hysterics whatís


270
0:33:16,797 --> 0:33:21,617
going on down here cause they know itís all the same thing theyíre arguing about. And of course


271
0:33:21,617 --> 0:33:32,18
if you look at religion itís been used in such a massively effective way in terms of advancing this agenda.


272
0:33:32,18 --> 0:33:40,488
First of all you go divide and rule which any small group trying to control a massive group has to divide and rule


273
0:33:40,488 --> 0:33:48,889
a massive rule to have any chance of success. But theyíre also selling belief systems which are different


274
0:33:48,889 --> 0:33:56,409
packages of the same belief system and those belief systems when you take them on they close the mind


275
0:33:56,409 --> 0:34:3,189
down and they wall off they firewall off the mind because anything outside of the belief system must be


276
0:34:3,189 --> 0:34:10,77
wrong so they wonít look at it so youíve turned someone into a person of tunnel vision and tunnel


277
0:34:10,77 --> 0:34:19,57
belief. and what we believe we perceive, we edit reality by based on what we believe and you can see this


278
0:34:19,57 --> 0:34:26,981
because you know when youíre having a conversation with someone who has a real preconceived belief


279
0:34:26,981 --> 0:34:33,1
about you and youíre having a conversation and youíre saying things to them and you siting there and you


280
0:34:33,1 --> 0:34:38,791
say "I never said that! I never said that" 
"Oh you did you did"


281
0:34:38,791 --> 0:34:47,282
Because what's happening is, you are saying things and it goes through the belief of the receiver


282
0:34:47,282 --> 0:34:54,313
the 'preconceived belief about you' system and it edits what's coming in by the time they consciously


283
0:34:54,313 --> 0:35:3,413
hear it. They are hearing what youíre saying in a way that confirms and underpins their preconceived


284
0:35:3,413 --> 0:35:11,24
belief about you. And so once you take on a rigid belief you edit your reality  and perception


285
0:35:11,24 --> 0:35:18,914
through that belief. So Christianity goes into Africa, it goes into Australia, it goes into North America


286
0:35:18,914 --> 0:35:25,864
and it destroys or as much as it could the thousands of years of knowledge and understanding


287
0:35:25,864 --> 0:35:31,754
that has been passed through that culture and imposes upon it the rigid beliefs of Christianity.


288
0:35:31,754 --> 0:35:38,15
Therefore taking out, because anything that was not about the rigid beliefs of Christianity


289
0:35:38,15 --> 0:35:43,865
"Itís the devil" you know. I mean Credo Mutwa the Zulu shaman in south Africa, great great friend


290
0:35:43,865 --> 0:35:52,226
of mine wonderful wonderful man. He was beaten silly as a kid for depicting Jesus as a black man.


291
0:35:52,226 --> 0:36:1,926
In a painting you know and he tells the story of how the Jesuits and all these people went into Africa


292
0:36:1,926 --> 0:36:15,957
and it became a crime to talk about or certainly to believe the ancient African knowledge thatís


293
0:36:15,957 --> 0:36:21,88
come through the centuries through the shamanistic screens, and destroying the ancient knowledge


294
0:36:21,88 --> 0:36:32,8
of reality of history which we really to have access to to get another fix on how we can look at the world


295
0:36:32,8 --> 0:36:41,419
and history in a different way, outside of the official history which has been written simple to get people to


296
0:36:41,419 --> 0:36:47,559
see the world and where weíve come from in a way that suits the agenda, so religion is just a fantastic


297
0:36:47,559 --> 0:36:51,479
weapon for this conspiracy we're talking about.


298
0:36:51,479 --> 0:36:58,0
And there is corruption even amongst the family of prophet Mohamed because unfortunately


299
0:36:58,0 --> 0:37:3,51
like it happened with Jesus, like it happened with Moses, like it happened with every single messenger


300
0:37:3,51 --> 0:37:11,121
of life on this planet, the day after they're dead they already start making their own way making their


301
0:37:11,121 --> 0:37:18,471
own changes to the religion to manipulate whatever the message was and adapt it to their own you know


302
0:37:18,471 --> 0:37:25,801
their own situation. I mean these messengers obviously come for a specific mission.


303
0:37:25,801 --> 0:37:33,721
Well the next thing on from the connections between religions and secret societies and the gods that


304
0:37:33,721 --> 0:37:41,212
they worship is Satanism because that's just another arm of this. This might be controversial to the


305
0:37:41,212 --> 0:37:50,652
believers in the religions and stuff youíve got the ancient gods which were translated into God


306
0:37:50,652 --> 0:37:57,233
which are worshiped by the religions unknowingly most of them. Same with the secret societies and the


307
0:37:57,233 --> 0:38:4,963
same "gods" demonic entities as theyíre called in this case that are worshiped by the Satanists are the same


308
0:38:4,963 --> 0:38:13,584
gods that are worshiped by the secret societies and the religions unknowingly, in Satanism its knowingly


309
0:38:13,584 --> 0:38:24,924
and these gods these non-human entities operate just outside the frequency range of human sight what is


310
0:38:24,924 --> 0:38:30,184
known as visible light, itís so important for people to understand that when they look through their eyes their


311
0:38:30,184 --> 0:38:36,205
not seeing everything that exists in the space theyíre looking at, we call space anyway, theyíre looking at


312
0:38:36,205 --> 0:38:45,636
merely a tiny frequency range that our five senses can access. Itís like a television station, itís like a holographic


313
0:38:45,636 --> 0:38:54,316
television station, and its sharing the same space as all the other realities what increasingly the cutting edge


314
0:38:54,316 --> 0:39:1,887
of mainstream science is calling parallel universes, see each other thereís a wireless internet in this room


315
0:39:1,887 --> 0:39:7,127
but were not aware of it, but you get a computer and you tune it into that wireless internet suddenly


316
0:39:7,127 --> 0:39:13,977
out of the ether out where comes the internet on your computer screen, and this physical form


317
0:39:13,977 --> 0:39:21,408
this body computer as i call it tunes us in to a certain frequency range which is what we perceive through the


318
0:39:21,408 --> 0:39:29,779
five senses but in the same space are other frequency range other dimensions of reality which are sharing


319
0:39:29,779 --> 0:39:35,88
the same space, now most of the time were not aware of them just like television stations are not aware


320
0:39:35,88 --> 0:39:44,63
of each other but of course in a situation you might tune into a radio station and its very very close to another


321
0:39:44,63 --> 0:39:54,69
station you get interference where the two radio stations interact with each other and thatís what can happen


322
0:39:54,69 --> 0:40:0,67
with these realities where thereís another reality thatís really really close on the frequency scale, there can


323
0:40:0,67 --> 0:40:8,831
actually be a crossing over between the two, and a satanic ritual one of the reasons they do it one of them


324
0:40:8,831 --> 0:40:17,741
is to create an energy environment through the way a ritual is conducted which allows like a vibrational window


325
0:40:17,741 --> 0:40:25,631
a doorway to open which allows these entities to enter the ritual. I've talked to endless people around


326
0:40:25,631 --> 0:40:34,272
the world who've seen this, actually experienced this suddenly this seriously horrible often entity looking


327
0:40:34,272 --> 0:40:41,152
entity appears in the so-called magic circle which is a vibrational field thatís what it is. You know they


328
0:40:41,152 --> 0:40:46,13
donít use these pentagrams and stuff just for fun, some of them might the lower ones who don't really


329
0:40:46,13 --> 0:40:50,753
understand it but the ones who are really involved that understand the way reality works and how you can


330
0:40:50,753 --> 0:40:59,534
manipulate it these pentagrams and these various symbols used in Satanism, like the reversed pentagram


331
0:40:59,534 --> 0:41:7,564
is the classic satanic symbol and the circle around it, they are vibrational fields thatís why they do these


332
0:41:7,564 --> 0:41:16,54
rituals and the entity can enter this reality the range of visible light in other words what we can see


333
0:41:16,54 --> 0:41:26,145
within that vibrational field and suddenly the gods appear. These gods as they're perceived feed off human


334
0:41:26,145 --> 0:41:33,216
energy, they feed off low vibrational human energy, low vibrational emotional energy all round based


335
0:41:33,216 --> 0:41:42,16
on fear, stressed, hatred, guilt, all these things these low vibrational emotions and another way they feed


336
0:41:42,16 --> 0:41:52,356
off human energy is by human sacrifice. What they do in the sacrifice is they'll have the victim and they'll


337
0:41:52,356 --> 0:42:1,797
go through this ritual and they build up the ritual to gain maximum terror from the victim so now there's


338
0:42:1,797 --> 0:42:11,77
tremendous energy not just of fear, but of absolute terror and then the point of sacrifice that energy is


339
0:42:11,77 --> 0:42:19,458
released massively and these "gods" that are operating just outside human sight, feed off of that energy


340
0:42:19,458 --> 0:42:28,208
because that terror that low vibrational energy represents the energy field that they are vibrating to and


341
0:42:28,208 --> 0:42:32,468
therefore they can absorb that energy, they can't absorb the higher dimensional energy they have to have low


342
0:42:32,468 --> 0:42:40,79
vibrational energies. Look at society its structured to create massive fear, stress all these things from the


343
0:42:40,79 --> 0:42:46,779
population and its feeding these quote gods 
and that enters the bloodstream at the point of sacrifice


344
0:42:46,779 --> 0:42:53,16
and then these sick people drink the blood cause itís got that adrenaline it gives them this rush


345
0:42:53,16 --> 0:43:1,971
what shocked me when i started to understand this and investigate this was the scale of it the SCALE


346
0:43:1,971 --> 0:43:9,381
is astonishing, and thereís people in America who've been involved their careers and things like the FBI


347
0:43:9,381 --> 0:43:16,513
investigating it in America and one of them said it is on such a scale Satanism that if you have a reasonably


348
0:43:16,513 --> 0:43:24,224
wide circle of friends, associates and acquaintances you will know Satanist who's involved in this stuff.


349
0:43:24,224 --> 0:43:35,764
Now when you start relating this stuff to history you come across this common theme everywhere of making


350
0:43:35,764 --> 0:43:45,565
sacrificial offerings to the gods of animals and of young virgins the young virgins sacrificed to the gods you


351
0:43:45,565 --> 0:43:53,505
find it everywhere. Of course in places like the Aztec period in central America they were doing it bloody on


352
0:43:53,505 --> 0:44:3,476
mass thousands of sacrifices and what was that? It was merely what is happening today. Is prepubescent


353
0:44:3,476 --> 0:44:11,756
pre-sexual activity energy. Thatís why they want children. Thatís why you had the young virgins sacrificed,


354
0:44:11,756 --> 0:44:22,567
they were kids! that's why they do it today for this very reason, and there are certain points where there are


355
0:44:22,567 --> 0:44:32,868
vortexes within the Earth energy field and these vortexes as they spin theyíre basically places where the


356
0:44:32,868 --> 0:44:39,638
connection between this dimension and other dimensions is much thinner much closer because of the nature


357
0:44:39,638 --> 0:44:48,629
of the vortex. Itís basically spinning two dimensions together in affect and so if you do the rituals on these


358
0:44:48,629 --> 0:44:58,809
vortexes then it is much easier energetically to manifest and bring out these gods into manifestation the other


359
0:44:58,809 --> 0:45:6,5
thing about the vortexes is is they are points where lots of, the big vortexes anyway, where lots of lay lines,


360
0:45:6,5 --> 0:45:18,17
meridian lines, energy lines, cross so what you do on those lines for a start is sourced by very powerful energies


361
0:45:18,17 --> 0:45:25,61
cause basically you got electricity grids coming in from the point of several directions to where youíre doing the


362
0:45:25,61 --> 0:45:34,971
ritual so youíre dealing with a powerful energy field which is what you want to achieve your outcome and also


363
0:45:34,971 --> 0:45:47,722
what you do at that point in terms of the energy that you create of hatred and terror and all these things that then


364
0:45:47,722 --> 0:45:55,643
goes through these lines from that point and youíre actually affecting the global grid by doing that. In terms of


365
0:45:55,643 --> 0:46:5,863
places where this goes on I can only talk about people that I've spoken to and things that I've


366
0:46:5,863 --> 0:46:19,174
come across. Certainly a lot of the major royal palaces are built on these prime sacrificial spots.


367
0:46:19,174 --> 0:46:26,254
In the first years of the 21st century


368
0:46:26,254 --> 0:46:30,934
a third world war broke out


369
0:46:30,934 --> 0:46:40,845
those of us who survived knew mankind could never survive


370
0:46:40,845 --> 0:46:43,476
a fourth


371
0:46:43,476 --> 0:46:52,356
that our own volatile natures could simply no longer be risked.


372
0:46:52,356 --> 0:47:1,326
So we have created a new arm of the law. The grammaton cleric


373
0:47:1,326 --> 0:47:14,727
whose soul task it is to seek out and eradicate the true source of man's inhumanity to man


374
0:47:14,727 --> 0:47:18,97
His ability


375
0:47:18,97 --> 0:47:19,878
to feel


376
0:47:19,878 --> 0:47:28,268
When the shadows, the whole world is controlled by the same force. Is that which is able


377
0:47:28,268 --> 0:47:34,698
to understand the way the human computer works, the way the human mind works the way


378
0:47:34,698 --> 0:47:41,446
the human emotions work that hidden shadow level that center of the web level they know


379
0:47:41,446 --> 0:47:46,156
that this is all an illusion that this is a holographic illusion it only exists in our head and


380
0:47:46,156 --> 0:47:54,987
therefore they can manipulate what we think our emotional state and how we see the world


381
0:47:54,987 --> 0:48:2,277
and ourselves because they understand how the computer works. It's basically like if you get


382
0:48:2,277 --> 0:48:9,768
a new personal computer you stick it on the desk you donít know anything about computers


383
0:48:9,768 --> 0:48:15,518
what do you do? you know you turn it on you might find an on switch and flip it about a bit


384
0:48:15,518 --> 0:48:21,358
you might find this and open this and oh whatís this... itís all very limited. And then a computer


385
0:48:21,358 --> 0:48:27,629
programmer walks in who knows absolutely how that computer works and he can do anything


386
0:48:27,629 --> 0:48:40,139
on it. That analogy sums up the human plight in the sense that this is a holographic biological


387
0:48:40,139 --> 0:48:46,66
computer and the vast majority of people in the world have no idea it's even a computer


388
0:48:46,66 --> 0:48:51,9
never mind how it really works and where theyíre thoughts and emotions are coming from and how


389
0:48:51,9 --> 0:48:59,31
theyíre manifesting reality but the spider in the center of the web does and it has structured society


390
0:48:59,31 --> 0:49:6,471
it has structured communication, it has constructed the information that we are receiving in the


391
0:49:6,471 --> 0:49:15,942
computer which were downloading to impose upon us a completely false reality that allows us to be


392
0:49:15,942 --> 0:49:29,673
computer like sheep rather than the infinite genius we really are if we could only break out of this


393
0:49:29,673 --> 0:49:36,863
computerized control thatís being imposed upon us. So the spider is not operating at the same level


394
0:49:36,863 --> 0:49:43,683
of knowledge as we are, not least because although this knowledge existed in the far ancient world


395
0:49:43,683 --> 0:49:52,204
the spider has manipulated events so that knowledge has been sucked out of mainstream society


396
0:49:52,204 --> 0:49:57,643
and held only by the few that pass it on through the highest and i mean highest levels of the secret


397
0:49:57,643 --> 0:50:9,845
society networks and so making people aware of this knowledge of the nature of reality the nature


398
0:50:9,845 --> 0:50:19,15
of who we are is fundamental to setting people free of the control that theyíre being subjected to


399
0:50:19,15 --> 0:50:27,646
because you know we can work on the level of banking scams, political scams, manipulated wars,


400
0:50:27,646 --> 0:50:36,866
manipulated 911s and we should because we need to know that but if thatís all were doing in terms


401
0:50:36,866 --> 0:50:45,557
of communicating knowledge then basically were operating in a cycle of this is the problem but how


402
0:50:45,557 --> 0:50:58,288
the hell do we get out of this. We will never know how to set ourselves free until we understand the nature


403
0:50:58,288 --> 0:51:6,337
of who we bloody-well are. How do you set yourself free if you donít even know who you are? How do you set


404
0:51:6,337 --> 0:51:10,218
yourself free when you donít even know the nature of reality that youíre living in and manifesting and making


405
0:51:10,218 --> 0:51:17,399
happen without your knowledge that youíre making it happen, you cant. So alongside the information about


406
0:51:17,399 --> 0:51:28,909
the five sense level of this conspiracy if you like, we have to just as powerfully i would say more powerfully


407
0:51:28,909 --> 0:51:35,7
communicate the nature of reality and how we are creating our reality and how we are allowing it to be


408
0:51:35,7 --> 0:51:41,83
created for us by having ourselves programmed with certain beliefs and certain perceptions all the time


409
0:51:41,83 --> 0:51:51,921
the two must go together otherwise, were never going to get out of this. and uh.. so itís a big task to get this


410
0:51:51,921 --> 0:52:1,521
stuff out but, because youíre not telling people anything you donít already know. If I tell you that thatís a computer


411
0:52:1,521 --> 0:52:6,271
and you're infinite consciousness I'm not telling you anything you donít already know. Iím telling you what youíve


412
0:52:6,271 --> 0:52:14,451
forgotten because what happens is you come into this world and with this knowledge suppressed. It's like


413
0:52:14,451 --> 0:52:22,892
someone once said, can you imagine you come into the world and someone tells you that 2 and 2 equals 5


414
0:52:22,892 --> 0:52:29,113
your parents tell you that from an earliest age 2 and 2 equals 5 you then go to kindergarten and nice teachers


415
0:52:29,113 --> 0:52:37,383
tell you that 2 and 2 equals 5. You then go to school and teachers junior school senior school they tell you


416
0:52:37,383 --> 0:52:44,294
2 and 2 equals 5. By now all your mates have been through the same system theyíre telling you 2 and 2 equals


417
0:52:44,294 --> 0:52:50,614
5 and if you say it equals 4 they laugh at you. You then go to university, professors with letters after their names


418
0:52:50,614 --> 0:53:2,975
mustaches, they say 2 and 2 equals 5 you know, oh no it equals 4, noooo Iíve been doing this for fifty years


419
0:53:2,975 --> 0:53:13,15
I've met all the best brains in the world, it equals 5 that boy will not go far. And then you turn the tele on


420
0:53:13,15 --> 0:53:21,986
"hey good evening, 2 and 2 equals 5... now the weather" right? Um.. Thereís a good chance that you'll go through the


421
0:53:21,986 --> 0:53:28,756
whole of your life believing 2 and 2 equals 5 but it still equals 4. And when, and what this information of the nature of


422
0:53:28,756 --> 0:53:37,477
reality is doing, basically its saying "do you remember 2 and 2 ... 4" "OHHH YEESSS" and this is why this has such an


423
0:53:37,477 --> 0:53:47,527
impact on people when they are.. they hear it something goes "this is true ahh this is true" because theyíre remembering


424
0:53:47,527 --> 0:53:58,568
it. We are in a world in which the vast majority of the population is in an amnesic state, they are in a hypnotic


425
0:53:58,568 --> 0:54:9,819
trance because they have been implanted with false information about themselves and the world ever since they arrived.


426
0:54:9,819 --> 0:54:20,539
Sat around a table and you said "right what we need to do is we need to find some way of getting young people


427
0:54:20,539 --> 0:54:28,93
to see the world in the way we want them to see it so by the time they become adults they are completely following


428
0:54:28,93 --> 0:54:38,641
the reality we want them to believe in" someone might say "well they might not have it like, but you know the ideal thing?


429
0:54:38,641 --> 0:54:46,59
what we do is we have a system where we take children away from their parents at least five days a week all day from about


430
0:54:46,59 --> 0:54:55,261
the age of four and five and we have control of their minds until theyíre about seventeen eighteen, that would be ideal"


431
0:54:55,261 --> 0:55:2,191
But of course that's what happens itís called the education system and its indoctrination. We have two hemispheres


432
0:55:2,191 --> 0:55:11,522
in the brain, the left brain which is about words and this world reality and you know the perception of this reality


433
0:55:11,522 --> 0:55:17,572
we have the right brain which is where you get creativity, inspiration, and connection and then you got this corpus


434
0:55:17,572 --> 0:55:27,142
callosum with connect the two. First of all we use the fraction of our brain why is that? And the other thing is is what


435
0:55:27,142 --> 0:55:37,123
the system does is it turns out left brain prisoners they run the system and it does it by putting information through


436
0:55:37,123 --> 0:55:47,214
schools and colleges and universities into the left brain which it then says at time of an exam "give me all that back


437
0:55:47,214 --> 0:55:56,575
and if you tell me what Iíve told you well enough to believe then you'll pass the exam and you'll be very successful"


438
0:55:56,575 --> 0:56:3,595
anyone that takes that information into the right brain and puts their spin on it or questions it or sees through it


439
0:56:3,595 --> 0:56:17,736
and puts that in the exam they are perceived as a disruptive influence in the classroom and so what happens is for


440
0:56:17,736 --> 0:56:32,897
you to become a doctor, overwhelmingly a politician, a journalist, someone often in industry, all these areas that


441
0:56:32,897 --> 0:56:41,87
control the system the professions the
professions, lawyers I mean on and on we go


442
0:56:41,87 --> 0:56:50,428
you have to of gone through your young life constantly taking information into your left brain and regurgitating it


443
0:56:50,428 --> 0:56:58,388
out on exam papers. To become a teacher you have to go through that process then you go through teacher training


444
0:56:58,388 --> 0:57:5,998
college where youíre taught how to do it to others, then you let loose on the children. The whole system is run by


445
0:57:5,998 --> 0:57:12,659
left brain prisoners and if you look at the school system things like music and art that stimulate this side of the brain


446
0:57:12,659 --> 0:57:24,61
the uniqueness they are constantly cut back in favor of left brain curriculums. And this is systematic, I have to get


447
0:57:24,61 --> 0:57:31,931
this over to people, this is not systematic at the level of you know people who administer it into reality. It is


448
0:57:31,931 --> 0:57:45,641
coldly calculated in the shadowy areas where these concepts first come from and they know what theyíre doing.


449
0:57:45,641 --> 0:57:50,761
Yea these examinations, whatís happening is that you know to fit in to be part of the so called in crowd you have to


450
0:57:50,761 --> 0:57:54,102
reconfirm the beliefs of the hierarchy.


451
0:57:54,102 --> 0:58:0,391
You know when youíre watching the teli (TV) your mind goes into the same brainwave state as you do in a hypnotic


452
0:58:0,391 --> 0:58:10,372
trance and what happens when youíre in a hypnotic trance with a hypnotist? He plants subliminal subconscious messages


453
0:58:10,372 --> 0:58:19,462
which implant a false reality "Oh the audience is laughing but what theyíre laughing at? This is an apple I can taste it"


454
0:58:19,462 --> 0:58:28,543
Itís a potato "no its a potato" the implanted belief is itís an apple so thatís what you are getting. Now symbolically thatís


455
0:58:28,543 --> 0:58:35,813
whatís happened to the world. The human population is eating a potato thinking itís an apple because theyíve been told


456
0:58:35,813 --> 0:58:39,964
from birth to death itís a freakin apple, it isnít.


457
0:58:39,964 --> 0:58:50,904
People think that hypnosis is some mysterious esoteric thing, and itís not itís just simply a mental transaction


458
0:58:50,904 --> 0:59:1,526
in which a person has focused their attention, theyíve stopped being critical and theyíre more open to suggestion


459
0:59:1,526 --> 0:59:12,885
If someone is looking for people to hypnotize they know that 85 out of 100 are going to be able to go into some level of trance.


460
0:59:12,885 --> 0:59:20,666
Hypnosis is a natural way of inducing a trance like state and we all have the ability to enter into trance.


461
0:59:20,666 --> 0:59:32,447
At many times during every day of our lives we slip into trance-like states where we become absorbed in watching the Television.


462
0:59:32,447 --> 0:59:40,358
The first order of business for a propagandist or an advertiser is to create the circumstances that will induce a state of mind


463
0:59:40,358 --> 0:59:46,728
that is favorable to the reception of their message and that state of mind is the hypnotic state of mind making television


464
0:59:46,728 --> 0:59:56,378
extremely important in this whole process of creating the unified mind-set amongst the entire population.


465
0:59:56,378 --> 1:0:8,889
Television is a massive massive... Mass hypnotist to the global mind, and what happens is it is implanting a belief


466
1:0:8,889 --> 1:0:20,549
in reality by the minute and then once we take on that belief implanted when information enters the eyes we edit


467
1:0:20,549 --> 1:0:31,81
it on the basis of that belief and so what the global population is subjecting or is subjected, to suffering from, is


468
1:0:31,81 --> 1:0:41,921
actually literally mass hypnosis and when people, when we talk about people who start to see things see the manipulation


469
1:0:41,921 --> 1:0:45,101
they couldnít see before, what do we say about them? what do they say about themselves?


470
1:0:45,101 --> 1:0:53,601
"I woke up!" exactly what theyíve done. When people start to go "hey I can see it now" itís like someone has gone


471
1:0:53,601 --> 1:1:0,262
along like the hypnotist and clicked their fingers and itís like "oh i can see it now" mass hypnosis and that


472
1:1:0,262 --> 1:1:7,363
is the greatest hypnotist on the planet, and thatís the basis of why it was created.


473
1:1:7,363 --> 1:1:10,953
[TV] "forty nine unidentified man went berserk last night..."
Where does she get her view of


474
1:1:10,953 --> 1:1:22,933
the world? Who will be her role model? What values will she have? Who's child is she?


475
1:1:22,933 --> 1:1:30,234
Yours or the networks?


476
1:1:30,234 --> 1:1:33,433
Take back your children


477
1:1:33,433 --> 1:1:36,974
turn off the TV


478
1:1:36,974 --> 1:1:44,804
And when you start to research the subliminals in advertising and television what staggers you is not


479
1:1:44,804 --> 1:1:51,125
what they do and whatís there, but the scale of it... our consciousness is being hit by an explosion of this stuff


480
1:1:51,125 --> 1:1:57,505
because you see this is a very interesting point. Experiments have shown that about one and a half seconds


481
1:1:57,505 --> 1:2:5,666
before the conscious mind decides to take action and moves its arms or whatever, speak, one in a half seconds


482
1:2:5,666 --> 1:2:10,156
before it consciously decides to do that the electrical signals have begun in the brain to do it


483
1:2:10,156 --> 1:2:21,856
For me the conscious level is the experiencer and observer of reality but the subconscious is the creator of it


484
1:2:21,856 --> 1:2:26,677
the generator of it and this is why the illuminati want the subconscious mind through subliminals. What does


485
1:2:26,677 --> 1:2:32,558
subliminals mean it means below threshold, itís below the threshold the conscious mind picks up but the


486
1:2:32,558 --> 1:2:38,127
subconscious mind picks everything up like a sponge, and therefore they are planting these thoughts into the


487
1:2:38,127 --> 1:2:42,997
subconscious which then filters down into the conscious and we think weíre having our own thoughts when actually


488
1:2:42,997 --> 1:2:49,178
theyíre implanted thoughts done at a subliminal level
If you think about it whenever you hear


489
1:2:49,178 --> 1:2:59,579
news broadcasters speak you realize that their speak pattern is similar to the pattern-speech of the hypnotist


490
1:2:59,579 --> 1:3:6,789
the news broadcaster looks directly into the camera and directly into the eyes of the viewer, another hypnotic trick


491
1:3:6,789 --> 1:3:13,279
Terror experts are working around the clock to head off any new attempt to attack America and theyíre concerned that


492
1:3:13,279 --> 1:3:21,35
in the not so distant future terrorists could easily blend in with the US population. Bob Wore now on Al-Qaidaís


493
1:3:21,35 --> 1:3:30,581
latest tactics. US officials are increasingly worried that the next attack on America could be carried out by American


494
1:3:30,581 --> 1:3:37,411
branded terror. Report will be released here in Washington tomorrow. It concludes that homegrown terrorism


495
1:3:37,411 --> 1:3:41,891
is the rise in this country and one of the most significantly contributing factors remains the internet. My question for


496
1:3:41,891 --> 1:3:53,2
you is this, I heard that on the 17th of this month George passed the executive order that says if you protest the


497
1:3:53,2 --> 1:4:5,573
Iraqi war you could have your assets [cut] Oh sorry about that, sorry to cut you off uh.. balloon town Connecticut


498
1:4:5,573 --> 1:4:16,733
Without these key elements in their history the children were being socially engineered into another direction.


499
1:4:16,733 --> 1:4:25,14
So weíve got several generations now where this kind of social engineering has perpetuated through the school systems


500
1:4:25,14 --> 1:4:31,644
fortunately there are a number of people who became aware of this particularly when Bill Benet was the secretary


501
1:4:31,644 --> 1:4:41,84
of education and had said that every child in this country should be taught by a Jesuit. The Jesuits are the intelligence


502
1:4:41,84 --> 1:4:53,185
arm of the Vatican and was very much corrupted to bring what Adolf Hitler said was a way to mass mind control of


503
1:4:53,185 --> 1:5:3,141
generations. It was Adolf Hitler who said that if there were any free thinkers in society he wasnít concerned because


504
1:5:3,141 --> 1:5:12,212
he had control of the minds of the children through the education system. That was something that I heard bill Benet


505
1:5:12,212 --> 1:5:23,332
quote himself in the application of the global education into this system... been head of our senator associations comity


506
1:5:23,332 --> 1:5:32,414
which means that he decides how money is going to be spent and how itís going to be delegated and he has made sure


507
1:5:32,414 --> 1:5:40,463
that more and more statesí rights are lost in favor of federal intervention and that was how global education was brought


508
1:5:40,463 --> 1:5:48,594
into the school systems as state rights were overwritten. Mark and I just returned from Europe, like he was saying


509
1:5:48,594 --> 1:5:59,385
we spoke in Germany and that was quite an experience and to see so many people who had been affected by


510
1:5:59,385 --> 1:6:8,456
mind control directly who have seen it in their own families who are acutely aware of what social engineering is


511
1:6:8,456 --> 1:6:19,386
in society. They know whatís happening in the United States theyíve been talking about it for years that I'm aware


512
1:6:19,386 --> 1:6:27,136
of particularly on the education aspect because it was exactly what Hitler had implemented and they were recognizing


513
1:6:27,136 --> 1:6:33,706
it. They were also recognizing also the erosion of our medical system and how we were becoming more and more


514
1:6:33,706 --> 1:6:48,337
financially dependent in this state, and losing more and more of our individual rights to information control but the


515
1:6:48,337 --> 1:6:56,908
compassion of people not only in Germany but all over the world where mark and I have been speaking out is very


516
1:6:56,908 --> 1:7:4,708
encouraging. To go outside this country is like a whole new world. I mean itís such a privilege to see that people are


517
1:7:4,708 --> 1:7:14,21
awake and aware. They know what mind control, they know that mind control has a firm grip on America right now


518
1:7:14,21 --> 1:7:25,219
that there is a criminal faction in control of our government that is seeking to control the world and its inexcusable


519
1:7:25,219 --> 1:7:35,0
that we continue to follow leaders that we didnít elect. We know that these people that are in place right now


520
1:7:35,0 --> 1:7:45,441
werenít elected. They keep taking the elections. Consider that the electronic voting machines were manufactured by


521
1:7:45,441 --> 1:7:56,922
key corporation one of the among the very very few that are actually controlling the media. They also manufactured


522
1:7:56,922 --> 1:8:7,52
our voting machines and Dick Chaney is associated with that corporation much the same way is with Halliburton.


523
1:8:7,52 --> 1:8:16,273
At that time George Romney was the governor of Michigan and he was very much interested in taking a very powerful


524
1:8:16,273 --> 1:8:23,353
form of mind control gleaned from the Catholics taken from the Catholics taken from the CIA and the Hitler/Himmler


525
1:8:23,353 --> 1:8:33,804
research and also into the technological advancements and put it into his Mormon church. George Romney was very


526
1:8:33,804 --> 1:8:42,324
active and very high up in the Mormon church and they could foresee that as a strong opportunity for being able to lead


527
1:8:42,324 --> 1:8:56,315
people by in a religious way. People are easily led by a religion because they do want to do what God tells them to do


528
1:8:56,315 --> 1:9:3,525
but the religion that theyíre being taught is outside themselves when in fact spirituality and relationship with God


529
1:9:3,525 --> 1:9:12,526
is within and yet religion can pull people down a path outside themselves where theyíre more easily led and controlled


530
1:9:12,526 --> 1:9:21,586
particularly when systematic abuses are going on and MK ultra mind control, and technological advances are being


531
1:9:21,586 --> 1:9:28,237
used as strong as they were in the Mormon church.


532
1:9:28,237 --> 1:9:37,537
Thatís not to say all Mormons are bad. Thereís quite a few Mormons who are standing up once theyíre


533
1:9:37,537 --> 1:9:45,738
able to think for themselves to make a positive difference and stop the abuse in their churches as well.


534
1:9:45,738 --> 1:9:55,599
But thatís a little bit slower the devastation wreaked on people within the Mormon church is extensive


535
1:9:55,599 --> 1:10:5,69
and is very much like the abuses that go on in the Jehovah's witnesses church that is just coming to light


536
1:10:5,69 --> 1:10:12,11
where their mind control is so prevalent there as well and every time where the mind control is prevalent


537
1:10:12,11 --> 1:10:20,169
there is always abuse and its usually sexual abuse of the children. We need to become aware of how people are being


538
1:10:20,169 --> 1:10:34,621
led this way. When we have a politics that have no separation of church and state it allows for them to dictate or to


539
1:10:34,621 --> 1:10:43,451
provide the information through the churches on a political agenda as well and is a very dangerous and very powerful


540
1:10:43,451 --> 1:10:54,131
combination yet nevertheless itís all moving towards the same goal of a mind control of the masses in Mackinaw Island


541
1:10:54,131 --> 1:11:6,22
Michigan I also heard George Romney talk about what is now known as global education where bringing the form


542
1:11:6,22 --> 1:11:15,273
of mind control into the education system and altering the history and also pumping information into the childrenís head


543
1:11:15,273 --> 1:11:24,554
at a rate to where they lose their ability discern and to creatively utilize the information but nevertheless itís just being


544
1:11:24,554 --> 1:11:31,727
pumped into their head especially with the onset of computerization and harmonics coming through the headphones


545
1:11:31,727 --> 1:11:42,508
while theyíre sitting at some of those computers. The computers were also deliberately designed to alter the history


546
1:11:42,508 --> 1:11:49,828
that they were being taught because it was believed that to control the future all they needed to do is control the


547
1:11:49,828 --> 1:11:58,269
history, again alter that knowledge base so that when they do formulate any thought or action itís based on something


548
1:11:58,269 --> 1:12:8,129
thatís totally false or is something thatís lacking key elements such as mind control such as what really went on in


549
1:12:8,129 --> 1:12:21,33
Nazi Germany. They knew how the mind responds to significant trauma. Combining the Hitler/Himmler research with what


550
1:12:21,33 --> 1:12:34,71
the Catholics had learned, and taking it into a new level with through the CIA and through the technological advancements


551
1:12:34,71 --> 1:12:44,812
that were beginning to come forth in society. We had television then which was having a strong impact on people


552
1:12:44,812 --> 1:12:52,372
and gave them the ability to implement mass mind-control far stronger than Adolf Hitler could do and also through the


553
1:12:52,372 --> 1:13:2,892
music because music was coming on so strong then and it was learned then how harmonics affect the brain function


554
1:13:2,892 --> 1:13:12,43
as well. Itís like when you hear a specific song and you can remember something that had happened the first time you


555
1:13:12,43 --> 1:13:19,33
ever heard that song. I heard people say that quite often well "i remember what happened um 'member when we


556
1:13:19,33 --> 1:13:25,414
were in the car and this song came on and remember how we fell in love to that song" I mean people remember certain


557
1:13:25,414 --> 1:13:38,34
events with music. Because the harmonic vibrations that affects the neuron pathways of the brain and allows for the


558
1:13:38,34 --> 1:13:47,355
song lyrics to go in deeper. So harmonics were coming on real strong as well. In the early 60s project paperclip was


559
1:13:47,355 --> 1:13:55,795
in full swing. The Nazi fascia scientists had been imported to the United States were put in key positions and


560
1:13:55,795 --> 1:14:9,756
information was gleaned from them on what Adolf Hitler was using as mind control in Nazi Germany. This project paperclip


561
1:14:9,756 --> 1:14:18,116
that brought the information in was being taken in by the CIA and criminal faction of the government that was very


562
1:14:18,116 --> 1:14:29,337
much interested on how to control the mind of individuals as well as control the minds of a population more-so than


563
1:14:29,337 --> 1:14:42,498
had occurred in Nazi Germany because those people had actually broke free of the Hitler plan to with the war but yet


564
1:14:42,498 --> 1:14:49,68
the war was so traumatizing that it still left them unable to think for themselves to the point where they became


565
1:14:49,68 --> 1:14:57,119
socially engineered. So thereís a great deal of information that was being brought into this country regarding the affects


566
1:14:57,119 --> 1:15:9,209
of trauma on human mind. Itís well known that when trauma occurs people become highly suggestible. When traumas


567
1:15:9,209 --> 1:15:20,83
occur in our societies such as what happened 9-1-1. This many people in this country PTSD'ed. They developed post


568
1:15:20,83 --> 1:15:30,1
traumatic stress disorder, this PTSD left people unable to think clearly for themselves they were very fearful they were


569
1:15:30,1 --> 1:15:38,411
very emotionally distraught over what had happened. And when theyíre not able to think clearly for themselves theyíre more


570
1:15:38,411 --> 1:15:45,561
easily lead so when theyíre told what to do by the television while those horrible images are played over and over and over


571
1:15:45,561 --> 1:16:0,392
again they become complaint they become apathetical and they become so easily led that America began to lose


572
1:16:0,392 --> 1:16:14,33
some of its strength to the point where the criminals that have been control now for numerous generations took a


573
1:16:14,33 --> 1:16:18,384
significant step forward in their control.


574
1:16:18,384 --> 1:16:26,74
Someone said, this is the Kennedy assassination here, something very true. When you try to understand who was behind an


575
1:16:26,74 --> 1:16:35,105
assassination look at who had the power to remove the security at the crucial time because he said assassinations donít just


576
1:16:35,105 --> 1:16:42,675
happen they are allowed to happen. And when you look at the footage taken on a camera video camera by a member


577
1:16:42,675 --> 1:16:49,395
of the public when Rabeen the Israeli prime minister was assassinated its extraordinary. You have the line of soldiers


578
1:16:49,395 --> 1:16:58,685
lined up to protect Rabeen as he came to his car and in among them was the guy who killed him. As Rabeen appears


579
1:16:58,685 --> 1:17:6,496
on this video extraordinary sight, the soldiers just walk backwards leaving the assassin on his own. Rabeen walks past


580
1:17:6,496 --> 1:17:13,406
him thank you very much Good night. And itís the same with the Kennedy assassination and so many others.


581
1:17:13,406 --> 1:17:20,257
This is the point where Kennedy was hit. This is Kennedyís car at the front.. thereís nobody on it. And yet you look at the car


582
1:17:20,257 --> 1:17:28,58
behind which doesnít carry the president of the united states, thereís four security guards and two out-riders.


583
1:17:28,58 --> 1:17:34,188
If theyíd of been there of course Kennedy could not have been killed by a bullet from outside cause he was so well


584
1:17:34,188 --> 1:17:41,629
protected but the whole thing was removed the security to allow it to happen. During the last war in the


585
1:17:41,629 --> 1:17:48,308
concentration camps of Germany in fact way way back this has been known about but particularly during the last


586
1:17:48,308 --> 1:17:55,809
war, they started to perfect the manipulation of a natural mechanism in the mind that shuts out trauma. What


587
1:17:55,809 --> 1:18:3,69
they did is that to understand that if you could systematically traumatize someone their mind would shut out


588
1:18:3,69 --> 1:18:9,405
the memory of it and create an amnesic barrier which would be disconnected from the rest of the mind


589
1:18:9,405 --> 1:18:15,925
this is what happens when people have a major road accident and they canít remember what happened


590
1:18:15,925 --> 1:18:21,136
itís because the amnesic barrier has been created to shut out trauma so we donít keep reliving the horror


591
1:18:21,136 --> 1:18:28,536
Good thing, but they realized if you could do that systematically and start with children particularly before


592
1:18:28,536 --> 1:18:35,486
the age of 5 and 6 you could turn their mind into a honeycomb of self-contained compartments none of which was


593
1:18:35,486 --> 1:18:40,807
aware of the others existence. And so through trigger words and what have you and trigger sentences hypnotic


594
1:18:40,807 --> 1:18:48,547
keys one amnesic barrier becomes the conscious level that experiences something or is programmed to do something


595
1:18:48,547 --> 1:18:55,71
and then is pushed back and another one is pulled forward. Itís actually got to the point where amazing as it may


596
1:18:55,71 --> 1:19:3,9
seem you can be drunk in one compartment and completely sober in the other. Once the programming is in there


597
1:19:3,9 --> 1:19:13,611
and in the biggest secret i put incredible documentation and background to this and what happened and trauma


598
1:19:13,611 --> 1:19:18,501
based mind control and how it creates assassins and people going crazy with guns to justify taking guns out of


599
1:19:18,501 --> 1:19:27,162
circulation all this stuff. When you look at the background all that is necessary is to program the guy push that


600
1:19:27,162 --> 1:19:34,512
programming back into the mind and that will stay there at the subconscious level until some trigger comes in


601
1:19:34,512 --> 1:19:43,823
when that trigger word or trigger action or whatever is said or done that programming is activated. So you can be


602
1:19:43,823 --> 1:19:50,894
in normal mode and be very normal and no problem "never noticed anything different about old' henry that night"


603
1:19:50,894 --> 1:19:55,883
trigger word BANG programming youíre like a robot.


604
1:19:55,883 --> 1:20:2,714
The drug trade is run by the intelligence agencies of every country and that's to finance the weapons business


605
1:20:2,714 --> 1:20:5,324
And also to recycle money
okay recycle money


606
1:20:5,324 --> 1:20:15,384
The whole thing has to make a 360 degree turn in a way that that money will always end up clean at the end


607
1:20:15,384 --> 1:20:25,165
of this whole transformation you know of this. So the weapon dealers are happy the drug dealers are happy


608
1:20:25,165 --> 1:20:31,96
the governments are happy because with the drugs they keep the people oppressed


609
1:20:31,96 --> 1:20:39,116
How involved is the Vatican with this whole drug trade which is basically for the purpose of financing


610
1:20:39,116 --> 1:20:42,436
the purchasing of weapons


611
1:20:42,436 --> 1:20:51,647
Because the drug trade is supported by the CIA or any other agency involved it being the Mossad


612
1:20:51,647 --> 1:21:3,888
or MI6 or whatever so they can go and finance those uh.. terrorist organizations that then create the


613
1:21:3,888 --> 1:21:11,988
strategic tension that they require so they can implement their own police state and rule us by the stick.


614
1:21:11,988 --> 1:21:22,889
Plus the drug itself makes the person who is using it depending on something which is supplies not


615
1:21:22,889 --> 1:21:32,69
guaranteed so if for example in the future the government decides to truly close down those drug


616
1:21:32,69 --> 1:21:41,0
cartels and stop immediately and once and for all the possibility of these drugs being spread through your


617
1:21:41,0 --> 1:21:44,75
towns and through your cities then at that point you will see a lot of people coming out on the street


618
1:21:44,75 --> 1:21:50,61
completely out of it because they are on a cold turkey situation and maybe theyíll start shooting and so


619
1:21:50,61 --> 1:22:1,11
that really could be one of the ways used by the powerful elite to instigate a revolution just stop the drug


620
1:22:1,11 --> 1:22:10,662
cartels and make all these people dependent of the white powder or any other drug get completely out of it.


621
1:22:10,662 --> 1:22:18,182
We have a lot of manipulation with drugs for example the Mossad that is manipulating with the Psytrance


622
1:22:18,182 --> 1:22:27,153
music all this big festivals of trance music this rave trance they call it and they have started this whole project


623
1:22:27,153 --> 1:22:35,373
by taking control of the drug scene in Goa India which all this make up of all these people into this alternative


624
1:22:35,373 --> 1:22:42,173
scene and so they can brainwash them with the fake religious ideals because after they take a few of these


625
1:22:42,173 --> 1:22:53,704
acids they start obviously coming into contact with these demonic forces that can easily make themselves


626
1:22:53,704 --> 1:23:1,444
present in their life and even they can sometimes bring them back from their dimension with them and never


627
1:23:1,444 --> 1:23:3,864
get rid of them anymore


628
1:23:3,864 --> 1:23:7,485
So how involved is the secret societies in the whole music industry


629
1:23:7,485 --> 1:23:15,855
The involvement of secret society in music industry is very important. Since the time of the establishment


630
1:23:15,855 --> 1:23:25,105
of certain lodges of Aleister Crowley in California to the subsequent spread of the beat and hippies generation


631
1:23:25,105 --> 1:23:34,266
and musicians like the rolling stones, the Beatles, and many others who not only have been highly influenced


632
1:23:34,266 --> 1:23:42,707
by this satanic creed but have sometimes openly embraced it like the rolling stones who have made even an album


633
1:23:42,707 --> 1:23:49,307
called "Their Satanic Majesty's Request" and in fact Mick Jager has been awarded after many years for his


634
1:23:49,307 --> 1:23:59,227
great work with the title of "Sir Mick Jager" by the queen herself, her satanic majesty ha-ha so you know you


635
1:23:59,227 --> 1:24:4,577
get even an award if you have sympathy for the devil


636
1:24:4,577 --> 1:24:13,908
But does uh.. does this even reach into the hip-hop music culture
Yes


637
1:24:13,908 --> 1:24:21,129
In the hip-hop music culture there is a lot of hip-hopers that are connected to black prince of freemasonry


638
1:24:21,129 --> 1:24:27,49
I myself somebody who followed the hip-hop scene at the beginning when it was still genuine but letís say by


639
1:24:27,49 --> 1:24:36,22
1986 it had already been infiltrated by the feds, the intelligence, CIA and it was used by for propaganda reasons and for


640
1:24:36,22 --> 1:24:45,35
establishing also hatred towards the whites from the blacks with the Niggas With An Attitude and all the rest and after


641
1:24:45,35 --> 1:24:53,881
they started to politicize this whole gang phenomenon so they could use it for establishing this whole culture which


642
1:24:53,881 --> 1:25:3,302
has spread all over the world not only in the United States which is a culture of completely and utter dementia


643
1:25:3,302 --> 1:25:10,661
I mean itís all about the booty how you shake your booty about how many gold chains you have how many cars you have


644
1:25:10,661 --> 1:25:24,752
what kind of Jacuzzi you have. These are all values of Satan himself. This is satanic but we have certain freemasons


645
1:25:24,752 --> 1:25:32,803
or prince of freemasonry that have been very important in the in this link between the gangs and the masonic


646
1:25:32,803 --> 1:25:36,513
world
Okay


647
1:25:36,513 --> 1:25:43,74
So between the illegitimate and the legitimate
Right wow thatís real interesting


648
1:25:43,74 --> 1:25:51,634
And also for the use of symbolism that a lot of hip-hopers have done using the illuminati symbols


649
1:25:51,634 --> 1:25:58,464
for their own for promoting their own 
 like what symbols are you talking about can you show me with your hands


650
1:25:58,464 --> 1:26:6,615
It can be the one dollar bill or it can be the classic masonic symbol square and compass or many others.


651
1:26:6,615 --> 1:26:14,345
An electron is a tiny tiny bit of matter, like a tiny marble


652
1:26:14,345 --> 1:26:22,806
Letís fire a stream through one slit. It behaves just like the marble. A single band.


653
1:26:22,806 --> 1:26:32,536
So if we shoot these tiny bits through two slits we should get like the marbles two bands.


654
1:26:32,536 --> 1:26:40,967
What an interference pattern, we fired electrons tiny bits of matter through


655
1:26:40,967 --> 1:26:49,608
But we get a pattern like waves not like little marbles. Physicist are clever they thought maybe those little


656
1:26:49,608 --> 1:26:58,528
balls are bouncing off each other and creating that pattern. So they decide to shoot electrons one at a time


657
1:26:58,528 --> 1:27:3,349
There is no way they can interfere with each other.


658
1:27:3,349 --> 1:27:7,638
But after an hour of this the same interference pattern is seen to emerge


659
1:27:7,638 --> 1:27:15,819
The conclusion is in-escapable: The single electron leaves as a particle becomes a wave of potentials goes


660
1:27:15,819 --> 1:27:25,149
through both slits and interferes with itself to hit the wall like a particle, but mathematically its even stranger


661
1:27:25,149 --> 1:27:33,24
it goes through both and it goes through neither, and it goes through just one and it goes through just the other


662
1:27:33,24 --> 1:27:39,884
all of these possibilities are in super position with each other but physicists were completely baffled by this


663
1:27:39,884 --> 1:27:46,823
so they decided to peek and see which slit it actually goes through.


664
1:27:46,823 --> 1:27:54,974
They put a measuring device by one slit to see which one it went through and let it fly. he he


665
1:27:54,974 --> 1:28:2,614
But the quantum world is far more mysterious than they could have imagined. When they observed the electron


666
1:28:2,614 --> 1:28:12,675
went back to behaving like a little marble. It produced a pattern of two bands not an interference patter of many


667
1:28:12,675 --> 1:28:24,406
the very act of measuring or observing which slit it went through meant it only went through one not both.


668
1:28:24,406 --> 1:28:30,326
The electron decided to act differently


669
1:28:30,326 --> 1:28:34,687
As though it was aware it was being watched.


670
1:28:34,687 --> 1:28:42,477
And it was here that physicist stepped into the strange never world of quantum events.


671
1:28:42,477 --> 1:28:49,417
What is matter marbles? or waves? And waves of what...


672
1:28:49,417 --> 1:28:54,877
and what does and observer have to do with any of this.


673
1:28:54,877 --> 1:29:9,306
The observer collapsed the wave function simply by observing.


674
1:29:9,306 --> 1:29:18,817
Tonightís talk is consciousness, creativity and the brain and if you have a golf-ball size consciousness when you read


675
1:29:18,817 --> 1:29:27,27
a book you'll have a golf-ball size understanding, when you look out a golf-ball size awareness and when you


676
1:29:27,27 --> 1:29:36,338
wake up in the morning a golf-ball size wakefulness. But if you could expand that consciousness then you read the


677
1:29:36,338 --> 1:29:46,169
book, more understanding, you look out more awareness and when you wake up more wakefulness its consciousness


678
1:29:46,169 --> 1:29:58,679
and thereís an ocean of pure vibrant consciousness inside each one of us and its right at the source and base of mind


679
1:29:58,679 --> 1:30:3,329
right at the source of thought and itís all at the source of all matter


680
1:30:3,329 --> 1:30:15,72
There is no matter as such all matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an


681
1:30:15,72 --> 1:30:27,48
atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together, we must assume behind this force


682
1:30:27,48 --> 1:30:36,111
the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter.


683
1:30:36,111 --> 1:30:43,692
Matter seems like a good place to begin. The solidity of the world seems totally indisputable. As a fixed thing that


684
1:30:43,692 --> 1:30:52,752
you can see and touch your body also reassuringly solid but beginning with Einstein modern physics has assured us that


685
1:30:52,752 --> 1:30:56,72
this solidity is a mirage.


686
1:30:56,72 --> 1:31:4,833
All of physical matter, everything we have around us, is a result of a frequency and what that also means is that if you


687
1:31:4,833 --> 1:31:9,683
amplify the frequency the structure of the matter will change


688
1:31:9,683 --> 1:31:21,424
What this self-contained system is a hologram is what i call the super hologram every within it is an expression of that


689
1:31:21,424 --> 1:31:32,94
hologram and this is one of the great characteristics of a hologram is that every part of a holographic picture is a


690
1:31:32,94 --> 1:31:36,514
smaller version of the whole 
 itís as if reality is so connected  that when you look at


691
1:31:36,514 --> 1:31:42,645
one small part you can see things about other parts that the entire whole is contained in the part and in a sense


692
1:31:42,645 --> 1:31:49,975
you canít divide reality up because were cutting up a hologram. We canít find where one particle is because itís always


693
1:31:49,975 --> 1:31:57,526
a reflection of all particles.
 In a hologram the whole pattern is whole and complete onto itself


694
1:31:57,526 --> 1:32:4,987
and if you were to take any little portion of this whole out and examine it closely you will see the entire pattern


695
1:32:4,987 --> 1:32:13,876
repeating itself again and again and again. Anywhere in this pattern if we were to change one little aspect on any


696
1:32:13,876 --> 1:32:19,927
one of these little holograms change would be reflected throughout the entire system.


697
1:32:19,927 --> 1:32:29,637
Quantum physics has revealed what ancient masters knew - matter does not exist. The concept of substance


698
1:32:29,637 --> 1:32:39,758
arose from the philosophy of Aristotle and from that concept came sciences conception of matter,


699
1:32:39,758 --> 1:32:49,149
the fact of the matter is that the substance of the universe is consciousness belief that the substance of the universe


700
1:32:49,149 --> 1:33:0,35
is matter leads to what i call a fear-grade dichotomy as people in their quite desperate attempt to accumulate


701
1:33:0,35 --> 1:33:10,18
as many material possessions and riches as possible. In fact the substance of the universe is consciousness


702
1:33:10,18 --> 1:33:16,801
therefore it is behavior that is important
If you get into the realms of fear


703
1:33:16,801 --> 1:33:28,591
Fear is a very slow dense vibrational state, and the more you embody fear and the whole of this manipulated


704
1:33:28,591 --> 1:33:35,892
society is globally is structured to make us fear to make us have stress to make us worry about tomorrow


705
1:33:35,892 --> 1:33:45,552
and have guilt about yesterday, and forget about now. It brings us into a slow vibrating dense state.


706
1:33:45,552 --> 1:33:51,652
We should be very careful about what we believe about the future. The more you attach to a belief system the more


707
1:33:51,652 --> 1:33:58,172
if reality is holographic, youíre helping create it by believing it and you know the great clairvoyant Edgard Casey said


708
1:33:58,172 --> 1:34:6,223
that our every thought that reality is built out of thought and our every thought starts to build reality and were like every


709
1:34:6,223 --> 1:34:10,243
thought is like a spider were like spiders spinning web and that web starts to build and build


710
1:34:10,243 --> 1:34:22,272
information is the key because this matrix this illusory reality that we think is real people say to me


711
1:34:22,272 --> 1:34:28,921
what is the matrix its information
information create fractals as information flow


712
1:34:28,921 --> 1:34:34,752
increases the number of fractals mathematically speaking increase. This was demonstrated by a mathematician


713
1:34:34,752 --> 1:34:39,843
by the name Theodor Gordon, fractals are unpredictable functions so things are becoming more and more


714
1:34:39,843 --> 1:34:45,302
unpredictable 
 when you start getting into fractals and chaos theory when you look at


715
1:34:45,302 --> 1:34:51,543
it in terms of a society this is where it starts to cross over into the so called illuminati and the negative


716
1:34:51,543 --> 1:34:57,764
elite the world leaders with their philosophy of order out of chaos.. there is some truth to that in the sense that


717
1:34:57,764 --> 1:35:6,204
when the system becomes highly destabilized there will be random shifts that suddenly self-organize into


718
1:35:6,204 --> 1:35:17,234
higher complexity
at the subatomic level reality behaves in accordance with the expectation of the observer or


719
1:35:17,234 --> 1:35:22,885
the measurer the scientist why is that remarkable? Because everything in the universe is composed of those


720
1:35:22,885 --> 1:35:31,296
subatomic particles
these atoms are particles that are whirling at lightning speeds around huge empty space


721
1:35:31,296 --> 1:35:39,496
and the particles arenít material objects, they're fluctuations of energy and information in a huge void of energy


722
1:35:39,496 --> 1:35:45,657
and information
and what the science now is showing is that when you can change the field in which the atom is


723
1:35:45,657 --> 1:35:51,437
in you change the atom, and were made of those atoms. So when we have feelings in our heart were changing the


724
1:35:51,437 --> 1:35:57,767
field that connects the stuff that everything is made of and were literally altering our physical reality


725
1:35:57,767 --> 1:36:5,428
Once you establish the reality we live in and the nature of what the physical body is, itís a biological computer,


726
1:36:5,428 --> 1:36:13,898
and the nature of what we are which is consciousness and then you start as I have looking at the way this world


727
1:36:13,898 --> 1:36:21,808
is structured and how it works and why they do this and why they do that, it suddenly brings into crystal clarity


728
1:36:21,808 --> 1:36:25,129
why the world is structured as it is because


729
1:36:25,129 --> 1:36:34,239
you know people look through their eyes and they think this the world but it isnít itís a tiny tiny frequency


730
1:36:34,239 --> 1:36:43,74
range within an infinite energy field of infinite frequency range and basically itís like holographic television channel


731
1:36:43,74 --> 1:36:52,65
It is the act of consciousness that actually creates the building blocks the universe is made of. I can't even imagine a


732
1:36:52,65 --> 1:37:0,91
universe that exists without us because itís the act of us observing the world around us that is creating allowing us to


733
1:37:0,91 --> 1:37:9,531
create as we go in a participatory universe. We may never find the edge of our universe as we're looking to define


734
1:37:9,531 --> 1:37:16,801
what this universe looks like, we may never find the smallest particle in the quantum world to see what the


735
1:37:16,801 --> 1:37:25,522
stuff is were made out of and the reason is because everywhere we look everywhere that consciousness explores


736
1:37:25,522 --> 1:37:34,493
with the expectation that something will be there that exploration that act of looking observation is the act


737
1:37:34,493 --> 1:37:40,203
that creates something for us to see. That we are actually building this universe as we go


738
1:37:40,203 --> 1:37:48,533
Consciousness is the programming language of the universe. We are consciousness conductors thatís what we do thatís


739
1:37:48,533 --> 1:37:55,824
who we are consciousness comes through us emanates from us. We are the creators, we are the ones who are


740
1:37:55,824 --> 1:38:2,124
targeted on this planet because we are the ones who transmit the reality just like everybody else does. If you switch


741
1:38:2,124 --> 1:38:10,514
your brain off and you sucked in to the mainstream media illusion we must understand that we are being used


742
1:38:10,514 --> 1:38:18,935
because we create reality so if we are manipulated in a certain way and if we are modulated in a certain way


743
1:38:18,935 --> 1:38:23,716
then our creation becomes not ours but somebody elseís
And what happens if we all did


744
1:38:23,716 --> 1:38:30,186
everyone in this room decides to take control of reality Iím talking about reality Iím talking about quantum physics


745
1:38:30,186 --> 1:38:36,696
Iím talking about taking control of things from the quantum level up from the molecular level up and it works. One of the things


746
1:38:36,696 --> 1:38:43,504
were actually dealing with is some kind of operating system that can be hacked using words


747
1:38:43,504 --> 1:38:48,14
The world is like a ride in an amusement park and when you chose to go on it you think its real cause thatís how powerful


748
1:38:48,14 --> 1:38:53,945
our minds are and the ride goes up and down and round and round it has thrills and chills and its very brightly colored


749
1:38:53,945 --> 1:39:0,775
and its very loud and its fun for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question


750
1:39:0,775 --> 1:39:6,696
is this real or is this just a ride and other people have remembered and they come back to us and they say "hey don't worry


751
1:39:6,696 --> 1:41:13,61
don't be afraid ever because.... this is just a ride."


752
1:41:13,61 --> 1:41:21,311
Look buddy I don't want no hassle today either pay for it or put it back


753
1:41:21,311 --> 1:41:55,639
Sleep, sleep, sleep...


754
1:41:55,639 --> 1:42:20,482
Can you believe it she didn't even go to Lamaze Class I told her for yourself and for the baby, Go!


755
1:42:20,482 --> 1:42:35,952
[gossiping]


756
1:42:35,952 --> 1:42:39,592
I'm so depressed I donít know what to do
Hey go for it man


757
1:42:39,592 --> 1:42:46,252
Easy for you to say you got the promotion
Look it will come alright just don't worry about it


758
1:42:46,252 --> 1:42:53,223
[TV] The feeling is definitely there, itís a new morning in America, fresh vital the old


759
1:42:53,223 --> 1:43:0,774
cynicism is gone. We have faith in our leaders were optimistic as to what the comes to it all


760
1:43:0,774 --> 1:43:9,354
It really boils down to our ability to accept. We donít need pessimism, there are no limits


761
1:43:9,354 --> 1:43:32,91
It figures it would be something like this.


762
1:43:32,91 --> 1:45:51,82
Well let me explain the (new) world order, let me help you ...


763
1:45:51,82 --> 1:45:53,892
9-11


764
1:45:53,892 --> 1:47:25,447
with a female underage in a motel by the Dallas police department on September eleventh 1960


765
1:47:25,447 --> 1:47:30,998
We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations


766
1:47:30,998 --> 1:47:38,628
a New World Order a world where the rule of law not the law of the jungle governs the conduct of


767
1:47:38,628 --> 1:47:46,658
nations. When we are successful and we will be, we have a real chance at this New World Order


768
1:47:46,658 --> 1:47:51,29
I think a New World Order is emerging
then really a New World Order can be created


769
1:47:51,29 --> 1:48:0,997
itís a great opportunity
a phrase that i often use myself that we need a New World Order


770
1:48:0,997 --> 1:48:5,368
Those people who have been yelling oh the UN is going to take over global government


771
1:48:5,368 --> 1:48:8,898
Conspiracy theorists
 Theyíve been crazy but now theyíre right


772
1:48:8,898 --> 1:48:13,9
Itís happening
When Geithner said he would be open to the idea


773
1:48:13,9 --> 1:48:19,768
of a global currency last week those conspiracy people had said and suggested that for years


774
1:48:19,768 --> 1:51:53,893
youíre not wrong.


775
1:51:53,893 --> 1:52:1,533
We can all make a change. We don't need a US president to make a change. We don't need the


776
1:52:1,533 --> 1:52:6,843
Dalai Lama to make a change. We don't need the pope to make a change. What we need to make a


777
1:52:6,843 --> 1:52:13,234
change is our own heart. Our own hearts needs to be placed in the right place and it has to have


778
1:52:13,234 --> 1:52:16,323
the right feelings.
I'm Sorry


779
1:52:16,323 --> 1:52:23,834
But I donít want to be and emperor thatís not my business. I donít want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help


780
1:52:23,834 --> 1:52:32,195
everyone if possible Jew, gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another human beings are like that


781
1:52:32,195 --> 1:52:38,435
we want to live by each otherís happiness not by each otherís misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another.


782
1:52:38,435 --> 1:52:43,515
And this world has room for everyone and the good Earth is rich and can provide for everyone.


783
1:52:43,515 --> 1:52:51,396
The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has


784
1:52:51,396 --> 1:52:58,356
barricaded the world with hate, has goose stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed


785
1:52:58,356 --> 1:53:4,7
but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made


786
1:53:4,7 --> 1:53:11,507
us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind, we think too much and feel too little. More than machinery


787
1:53:11,507 --> 1:53:17,717
we need humanity, more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life would


788
1:53:17,717 --> 1:53:24,378
be violent and all would be lost. The airplane and the radio has brought us closer together, the very nature of these


789
1:53:24,378 --> 1:53:30,218
inventions cries out for the goodness in men. Cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all


790
1:53:30,218 --> 1:53:36,878
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and children


791
1:53:36,878 --> 1:53:43,49
Victim of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. For those who can hear me I say


792
1:53:43,49 --> 1:53:50,539
do not despair, the misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way


793
1:53:50,539 --> 1:53:57,529
of human progress. The hate of men who will pass, and dictators die and the power they took from the people


794
1:53:57,529 --> 1:54:6,53
will return to the people and so long as men die liberty will never perish. Soldiers don't give yourselves to


795
1:54:6,53 --> 1:54:12,46
brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do what to think and what


796
1:54:12,46 --> 1:54:19,4
to feel. Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder, donít give yourself to these


797
1:54:19,4 --> 1:54:25,971
unnatural men. Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not


798
1:54:25,971 --> 1:54:32,582
cattle.. you are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate, only the unloved hate, the


799
1:54:32,582 --> 1:54:39,962
unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty in the 17th chapter of Saint Luke it is


800
1:54:39,962 --> 1:54:46,482
written the kingdom of god is within man not one man nor a group of men but in all men, in you, YOU the people


801
1:54:46,482 --> 1:54:52,822
have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness, you the people have the power


802
1:54:52,822 --> 1:54:58,763
to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy


803
1:54:58,763 --> 1:55:6,784
let us use that power, let us all unite. Let us all fight for a new world, a decent world that will give man a chance


804
1:55:6,784 --> 1:55:13,364
to work, that will give youth a future and old agers security. By the promise of these things brutes have risen to power


805
1:55:13,364 --> 1:55:21,264
but they lie, they do not fulfill that promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people


806
1:55:21,264 --> 1:55:29,155
Now let us fight to fulfill that promise, let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers. To do


807
1:55:29,155 --> 1:55:36,655
away with greed, with hate and intolerance, let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress


808
1:55:36,655 --> 1:55:42,395
will lead to all menís happiness. Soldiers in the name of democracy


809
1:55:42,395 --> 1:55:57,326
Let us all UNITE


810
1:55:57,326 --> 1:56:3,617
I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid.


811
1:56:3,617 --> 1:56:10,277
You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future.


812
1:56:10,277 --> 1:56:16,957
I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how itís going to begin.


813
1:56:16,957 --> 1:56:21,967
I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.


814
1:56:21,967 --> 1:56:26,188
I'm going to show them a world without you,


815
1:56:26,188 --> 1:56:30,168
A world without rules and controls without borders or boundaries


816
1:56:30,168 --> 1:56:36,679
A world where anything is possible


817
1:56:36,679 --> 1:58:36,679
Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.
