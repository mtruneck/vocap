###0 STEVE SPANGLER: So today's questions.
###1 Who likes a lot of these lights and these lights here
###4 and some batteries and this thing and some electrical tape
###7 and a whole thing of super strong magnets?
###9 Who?
###10 This guy.
###12 I'm Steve Spangler and I'm all about making science fun.
###15 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###18 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###21 experiences.
###22 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###24 affect the way people think about science.
###27 And to do that I live by one motto, make it big, do it
###31 right, give it class.
###32 
###38 As a kid you probably had a whole bunch of these Christmas
###40 lights, you know the strand that breaks, and somebody
###43 throws them away and you figured this out.
###44 You figured that you could take a pair of scissors-- no,
###46 not while it's plugged in-- you could take a pair of
###48 scissors, cut it, strip the ends off and get something
###51 that looks like this.
###53 This now, was perfect to be able to learn how to use and
###56 make circuits.
###57 So you'd find yourself a big battery, because you needed to
###60 have a good supply of energy there.
###62 Because you never wanted to hook up just one.
###64 You'd want to hook up multiples.
###65 So you'd hang onto this one.
###66 And this one would hook up and use alligator clips.
###69 And, low and behold, if you completed the circuit, it
###73 looked like this.
###74 You see, as a kid, I was easily amused.
###77 You could do parallel circuit and series circuits and
###79 switches and whatever else you wanted to but, in short order,
###84 LEDs gave way to all of this material here.
###88 And this, was the new battery and bulbs unit.
###91 LEDs, light emitting diodes.
###93 They come in all these different sizes and shapes and
###96 colors, and they run off such a small amount of energy.
###98 This is a watch battery, so instead of that huge one we
###101 had before, now you just have this small little battery.
###104 In this state here, this will last 30, maybe 40 days
###108 constantly on, and this is the basis of today's project.
###112 It's amazing what you can find online.
###114 I want to show you how to make a throwie.
###116 A throwie is a device that was invented back in 2005, by
###120 Graffiti Research Lab.
###122 The idea was this-- what if you could make light in a
###126 device that you could throw and have it stick to a metal
###130 object and literally, graffiti the side of a bridge or a
###134 building, something like that, using light as a graffiti
###137 source instead of a can of paint.
###138 And that's exactly what a throwie is.
###140 Still don't understand what we're talking about?
###142 Take a look at this video from Graffiti Research Lab.
###145 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###180 Here's what you're going to need, some LEDs.
###182 Now, LEDS come in all shapes and sizes.
###185 These are 10 millimeter LEDs.
###186 They're super bright and they're probably--
###190 I don't know--
###190 $0.20, $0.30 cents apiece if you're buying a bag of 100 of
###193 them, in bulk, online.
###194 To power them you're going to need to have these watch
###196 batteries here.
###197 These are CR 2032s, very, very common.
###200 It's a three volt battery.
###201 Again, in quantity, maybe $0.30, $0.40.
###204 You're going to need to have some electrical tape.
###206 And finally, neodymium magnets, so
###208 super strong magnets.
###209 And that's what's going to hold it in place.
###211 So let's start by making a red LED throwie and you're going
###214 to start with the LED.
###215 Now, these are 10 millimeter super brights.
###218 And you're going to open up the little ends like this, so
###222 that you can take the watch battery and kind of put it
###224 right in between.
###225 No extra wires needed, just hold it in place and it works.
###228 If for some reason it doesn't work, it just means that you
###230 have the LED probably reversed.
###233 So if you put in place and it doesn't work, it doesn't mean
###235 the battery is bad or the LED is bad.
###236 Try just reversing it since this is polarity sensitive,
###239 meaning plus goes to plus and minus goes to minus.
###242 And it's ready to go.
###243 It's just a simple little diode.
###245 It starts with a piece of electrical tape.
###247 If you pull off a piece of the tape, you can now make the
###250 throwie like this.
###252 And you want to just tape the leads in place around the
###256 battery so it's making constant contact and this, is
###262 a simple circuit.
###263 Now, I guess it could be tossed around.
###264 You could do something with it.
###266 But it's not sticky and that's where the magnet comes in.
###269 Well, to turn the LED and the watch battery into a throwie,
###273 you're going to need to have a super strong neodymium magnet.
###275 Now, these little guys have become expensive over the last
###278 year and a half or two years, so that's the most expensive
###280 part of the project, but you really do need these small
###282 little neodymium magnets.
###285 Here's how it works.
###286 We use the watch battery to complete the circuit here with
###289 the LED and then, we put the magnet right on the lead so it
###294 literally, holds it in place.
###296 Now, this whole thing gets wrapped with the electrical
###298 tape and you have yourself a throwie.
###302 We have everything in place now we just need to have
###304 something metal.
###305 That's where the trash can lid comes into place.
###308 And that's what you call a throwie.
###310 Now, you just need more.
###312 What a perfect way to be able to combine science and art.
###317 What if you had a throwie that you could turn on and off
###321 using this little plastic tab?
###323 It's easy to make.
###324 Higginsworth actually came up with this.
###326 This is a little plastic tab here that you
###329 just pull in and out.
###330 And it's made out of this little plastic here.
###332 So we just took a piece of recycled packaging material,
###335 cut it up in there.
###336 It was perfect.
###337 And this electrical tape that you see here, has another
###340 piece of electrical tape here that won't stick to this, so
###343 that it's easy to be able to slide it in and out.
###345 Wrap the electrical tape around, put it on the magnet
###348 side, and watch this as you pull, it lights up.
###351 When you're done playing with it you are
###353 back as you were before.
###355 So let's say you're making a throwie, you've got your LEDs.
###358 You've got the battery.
###359 You've got your electrical tape.
###362 The only thing you're missing is, of course, those super
###364 expensive neodymium magnets.
###367 Is there another way to get it to stick to something?
###369 Well, how about Velcro?
###371 So we just went out and bought some of the sticky back Velcro
###374 and cut the Velcro so that you put, for example,
###377 the hook side here.
###379 And now, it's easy to be able to throw it onto the loop side
###382 and it sticks perfectly.
###383 Which got me to thinking, what if you could make an entire
###386 suit, a jumpsuit, out of Velcro?
###388 And you had, oh, I say, 150 or so friends that would throw
###393 throwies on that jumpsuit.
###396 Take a look at this.
###399 Well, you know how to make a throwie using the Velcro.
###401 The only thing you need now is something to throw the Velcro
###404 to and that's where Higginsworth comes in.
###406 Higginsworth, you have the Velcro and it's the other side
###409 and it sticks.
###411 It's perfect.
###412 But that's not very fun.
###413 It would be fun if there are hundreds of them like this.
###416 
###425 Now, that's cool.
###426 
###445 Now, I have three Velcro people
###447 and hundreds of friends.
###449 Watch this.
###450 Go!
###451 
###493 Let's here it for Velcro, people!

###532 HIGGINSWORTH: What kind of ice cream do we get to try?
###533 FEMALE SPEAKER: Caramel cone, cookies and cream, mango
###535 sorbet and Belgian chocolate.
