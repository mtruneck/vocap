THOMAS MORTON: Morning
in Sarajevo.


5
0:0:10,39 --> 0:0:12,96
The cloud is lifting
over the city.


6
0:0:12,96 --> 0:0:15,6
We almost died in our
Yugo last night.


7
0:0:15,6 --> 0:0:18,8
So we decided to give it a
rest and trade up for our


8
0:0:18,8 --> 0:0:21,262
fixer's Chevy Aveo.


9
0:0:21,262 --> 0:0:23,69
So you can see, the choice has
made all the difference.


10
0:0:23,69 --> 0:0:26,41
We're automotively living in
a lap of luxury right now.


11
0:0:26,41 --> 0:0:30,4



12
0:0:30,4 --> 0:0:31,92
This is our fixer, Elvis.


13
0:0:31,92 --> 0:0:34,21
He's blind in one eye, which
kind of makes him look like a


14
0:0:34,21 --> 0:0:36,3
Bosnian David Bowie.


15
0:0:36,3 --> 0:0:43,42
He's also wrecked three cars in
the week we've known him.


16
0:0:43,42 --> 0:0:43,71
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


17
0:0:43,71 --> 0:0:45,722
I was wondering where all
this mist came from.

[HORN HONKS]


20
0:1:2,45 --> 0:1:4,9
THOMAS MORTON: Before the Serbs
turned it into Hogan's


21
0:1:4,9 --> 0:1:6,98
Island in the '90s, Sarajevo
was an extremely modern


22
0:1:6,98 --> 0:1:8,65
European city.


23
0:1:8,65 --> 0:1:10,83
It's also the biggest Muslim
city in Europe.


24
0:1:10,83 --> 0:1:13,5
Though most residents are
Muslims the same way, like,


25
0:1:13,5 --> 0:1:14,94
New Yorkers are Jews
or Christians.


26
0:1:14,94 --> 0:1:16,69
They go to mosque for prayers
and the holidays, but


27
0:1:16,69 --> 0:1:17,54
that's about it.


28
0:1:17,54 --> 0:1:19,915
All the men have shaved
faces, most people


29
0:1:19,915 --> 0:1:20,975
drink, ladies wear jeans.


30
0:1:20,975 --> 0:1:22,68
It's relaxed.


31
0:1:22,68 --> 0:1:24,96
While the majority of Sarajevans
and really Bosnians


32
0:1:24,96 --> 0:1:28,1
in general are sort of Friday
Muslims, Islam is still a


33
0:1:28,1 --> 0:1:30,2
really big deal.


34
0:1:30,2 --> 0:1:32,44
During the wars, the Bosniak
Muslims became a cause celebre


35
0:1:32,44 --> 0:1:35,32
in the Arab world, with
countries like Saudi Arabia


36
0:1:35,32 --> 0:1:38,33
and Afghanistan sending money
for humanitarian aid and even


37
0:1:38,33 --> 0:1:41,9
funneling Mujahideen fighters
in to lend a hand.


38
0:1:41,9 --> 0:1:43,9
All of which is basically
a push to increase Arab


39
0:1:43,9 --> 0:1:45,65
influence in the region and
stoke a national religious


40
0:1:45,65 --> 0:1:48,29
revival, which naturally would
play into places like Saudi


41
0:1:48,29 --> 0:1:51,12
Arabia's political interests.


42
0:1:51,12 --> 0:1:52,88
This mega mosque in
Sarajevo was built


43
0:1:52,88 --> 0:1:54,355
entirely with Saudi money.


44
0:1:54,355 --> 0:1:56,58
It's also on the grounds of
the Saudi Embassy, which


45
0:1:56,58 --> 0:1:59,3
technically means it's on
Saudi Arabian soil.


46
0:1:59,3 --> 0:2:2,0
And obviously the crowd here
looks a little different from


47
0:2:2,0 --> 0:2:3,547
the congregation across town.


48
0:2:3,547 --> 0:2:6,409



49
0:2:6,409 --> 0:2:11,24
Now, our goal right now is to
see if we can meet some local


50
0:2:11,24 --> 0:2:13,27
Muslims and figure out
what's going on.


51
0:2:13,27 --> 0:2:16,85
And figure out why they're
more kind of into Islamic


52
0:2:16,85 --> 0:2:21,7
identity and, by possible
extension, extremist Islamism


53
0:2:21,7 --> 0:2:26,955

61

THOMAS MORTON: Sarajevo and
Bosnia's other big cities


62
0:3:20,82 --> 0:3:22,78
aren't exactly seed beds of
fundamentalist Islam,


63
0:3:22,78 --> 0:3:24,14
at least not yet.


64
0:3:24,14 --> 0:3:26,23
But there's a village in the
north of the country called


65
0:3:26,23 --> 0:3:30,27
Gornja Maoca that adheres
to strict Wahabi Islam.


66
0:3:30,27 --> 0:3:31,47
The men there have beards.


67
0:3:31,47 --> 0:3:32,65
The women wear full niqab.


68
0:3:32,65 --> 0:3:34,49
It's kind of quaint.


69
0:3:34,49 --> 0:3:36,95
Well, quaint in the way that
Western newspapers describe


70
0:3:36,95 --> 0:3:40,11
with things like "Afghanistan
in Europee" and "a potential


71
0:3:40,11 --> 0:3:42,202
terrorist training camp."


72
0:3:42,202 --> 0:3:45,2
The residents of Gornja Maoca
aren't super receptive to this


73
0:3:45,2 --> 0:3:48,27
criticism or really the
media in general.


74
0:3:48,27 --> 0:3:50,64
Actually, almost every camera
crew that's gone to visit them


75
0:3:50,64 --> 0:3:53,4
has been driven out
of the village.


76
0:3:53,4 --> 0:3:56,35
In addition to just bad press,
Gornja Maoca has also been


77
0:3:56,35 --> 0:3:57,67
raided by the local
and national


78
0:3:57,67 --> 0:4:0,2
police numerous times.


79
0:4:0,2 --> 0:4:3,8
In 2010, the Bosnian DA's office
sent 600 officers to


80
0:4:3,8 --> 0:4:5,52
the village to search for
guns and evidence


81
0:4:5,52 --> 0:4:7,77
of terrorist activity.


82
0:4:7,77 --> 0:4:9,46
We were nervous about swinging
by the village unannounced.


83
0:4:9,46 --> 0:4:12,2
However, our fixer, Elvis,
spent the previous month


84
0:4:12,2 --> 0:4:14,83
hanging out with the Gornja
Maocans at noon time prayers


85
0:4:14,83 --> 0:4:16,579
and has kind of become
buds with some of the


86
0:4:16,579 --> 0:4:18,45
younger guys there.


87
0:4:18,45 --> 0:4:20,44
Which hopefully means we can
stop by and have a nice,


88
0:4:20,44 --> 0:4:22,69

rocks thrown at our heads.

goodwill, or at least what we

hoped would be perceived as good
will, we left the camera


93
0:4:38,48 --> 0:4:40,37
in the back seat of the car and
got out to wait for the


94
0:4:40,37 --> 0:4:42,155

afternoon prayers.

around, right?

just picks up rocks, but I

THOMAS MORTON: Dispute being
walked out of the village by


182
0:9:27,7 --> 0:9:29,45
bearded men with the rocks in
their hands, the more we


183
0:9:29,45 --> 0:9:32,3
learned about Gornja Maoca, the
more sympathetic we became


184
0:9:32,3 --> 0:9:34,63
to it's wacky Wahabist
residents.


185
0:9:34,63 --> 0:9:36,97
Then two months later, one of
those guys shot up the US


186

which seems a little off.


187
0:9:40,52 --> 0:9:44,75



188
0:9:44,75 --> 0:9:47,13
So what have we learned
in the Balkans?


189
0:9:47,13 --> 0:9:49,6
My generation grew up ingrained
with the idea that


190
0:9:49,6 --> 0:9:51,94
things like ethnic and racial
and religious differences were


191
0:9:51,94 --> 0:9:53,95
ultimately just bullshit.


192
0:9:53,95 --> 0:9:56,33
The Balkans and the wars in
the '90s is kind of a


193
0:9:56,33 --> 0:9:58,16
centerpiece of this
way of thinking.


194
0:9:58,16 --> 0:10:0,33
We'll acknowledge that they have
different cultures, and


195
0:10:0,33 --> 0:10:2,13
they live in different
geographies.


196
0:10:2,13 --> 0:10:4,22
But we think about it the same
way we think of people from


197
0:10:4,22 --> 0:10:6,9
different states, sort of like
Americans versus Canadians.


198
0:10:6,9 --> 0:10:8,34
We say, hey, they
look the same.


199
0:10:8,34 --> 0:10:9,48
So what's the freaking
problem?


200
0:10:9,48 --> 0:10:12,69
As if that's some sort
of solution.


201
0:10:12,69 --> 0:10:15,11
But the ethnic differences
aren't what actually matters.


202
0:10:15,11 --> 0:10:17,145
It's the way people have
internalized these differences


203
0:10:17,145 --> 0:10:21,26
and the way they've been doing
so for 1,000 very messy years.


204
0:10:21,26 --> 0:10:23,16
This isn't unique to
the Balkans either.


205
0:10:23,16 --> 0:10:25,3
There's isn't something
intrinsic about Serbs and


206
0:10:25,3 --> 0:10:29,4
Croats that makes them hate each
other, ditto Bosnians.


207
0:10:29,4 --> 0:10:31,215
What's really kind of scary is
what happened here in the '90s


208
0:10:31,215 --> 0:10:33,405
could happen seriously
anywhere on Earth.


209
0:10:33,405 --> 0:10:36,15
We're all just simmering pots
of rage and intolerance


210
0:10:36,15 --> 0:10:38,45
waiting for an excuse to
brutalize each other like


211
0:10:38,45 --> 0:10:39,45
fucking ape men.


212
0:10:39,45 --> 0:10:43,11
That's the real lesson in
Yugoslavia, that and none of

0:10:43,11 --> 0:10:45,3
