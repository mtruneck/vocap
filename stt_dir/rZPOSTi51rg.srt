1
0:0:0,81 --> 0:0:2,81
ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT ME TO REVIEW?


2
0:0:2,81 --> 0:0:15,25
SERE. COULD I REVIEW THE TERM SERE, S-E-R-E.


3
0:0:15,25 --> 0:0:19,73
ALL SERE IS, IS A TERM WE USE FOR THE DIFFERENT


4
0:0:19,73 --> 0:0:22,839
SUCCESSIONAL STAGE THAT'S OCCUR LEADING UP
TO


5
0:0:22,839 --> 0:0:30,4
A CLIMAX. IT IS JUST A TERM TO DENOTE A PREDICTABLE


6
0:0:30,4 --> 0:0:34,88
STEP IN THE ORDERLY SEQUENCE OF COMMUNITIES.
THAT IS


7
0:0:34,88 --> 0:0:37,4
REALLY ALL IT IS. I PROBABLY COULD HAVE GOTTEN
BY


8
0:0:37,4 --> 0:0:45,24
WITHOUT EVEN MENTIONING IT. IS THE TERM TAXON


9
0:0:45,24 --> 0:1:5,39
LIKE SERE? OKAY. YOU HAVE TO SAY IT AGAIN.
THE


10
0:1:5,39 --> 0:1:11,84
QUESTION IS, DOES THE TERM TAXON AND SERE
HAVE REAL


11
0:1:11,84 --> 0:1:14,14
MEANINGS OR ARE THEY JUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE
OF THE


12
0:1:14,14 --> 0:1:17,42
OBSERVER? WELL, TAXON TENDS TO HAVE A MEANING.
WHEN


13
0:1:17,42 --> 0:1:21,679
WE SAY TAXON, WE TEND TO MEAN A PARTICULAR,


14
0:1:21,679 --> 0:1:25,46
A PARTICULAR TAXONOMIC UNIT. NOW, YOU ARE
RIGHT, IT


15
0:1:25,46 --> 0:1:28,74
CAN VARY IN THAT SOME PEOPLE REFER TO A SPECIES
AS


16
0:1:28,74 --> 0:1:33,49
A TAXON. A GENUS AS A TAXON OR A FAMILY DEPENDING
ON


17
0:1:33,49 --> 0:1:35,24
WHAT LEVEL THEY ARE IDENTIFYING IT. SO YOU
ARE RIGHT


18
0:1:35,24 --> 0:1:40,95
ON THAT. SERES, YES THEY ARE, THEY ARE IDENTIFIED
BY


19
0:1:40,95 --> 0:1:44,139
 SOMEONE DESCRIBING THEM. BUT, THEY USUALLY
ARE MORE


20
0:1:44,139 --> 0:1:47,149
SET THAN THE TERM TAXON. IN OTHER WORDS WHEN
YOU


21
0:1:47,149 --> 0:1:50,31
DESCRIBE A CERTAIN SERE YOU REALLY MEAN A
CERTAIN


22
0:1:50,31 --> 0:1:52,899
STAGE IN THAT SUCCESSION. BUT, YOU ARE RIGHT
IT COMES


23
0:1:52,899 --> 0:1:55,399
FROM THE OUTSIDE. IT IS MADE BY A DESCRIBER.


24
0:1:55,399 --> 0:1:58,56
INTERESTING IDEA. NEVER HAD THAT. ANY OTHER


25
0:1:58,56 --> 0:2:3,27
QUESTIONS BEFORE WE START?


26
0:2:3,27 --> 0:2:7,679
OKAY. WE ARE GOING TO ADVANCE TO THE FINAL
AND


27
0:2:7,679 --> 0:2:12,459
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF ECOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION.
WE ARE


28
0:2:12,459 --> 0:2:15,99
REALLY GOING ALL OF THE WAY TO THE TOP TODAY.
WE ARE


29
0:2:15,99 --> 0:2:19,25
GOING TO THE ECOSYSTEM. TO THE ECOSYSTEM.
THIS IS


30
0:2:19,25 --> 0:2:23,99
AGAIN, IN OUR PROGRESSION FROM POPULATIONS
TO


31
0:2:23,99 --> 0:2:28,69
COMMUNITIES, TO ECOSYSTEMS. WE ARE GRADUALLY
GETTING


32
0:2:28,69 --> 0:2:31,819
MORE COMPLEX. AND, AS YOU CAN SEE BOTH IN
YOUR STUDY


33
0:2:31,819 --> 0:2:35,379
SHEETS AND IN WHAT ARE WRITTEN ON THE BOARD,


34
0:2:35,379 --> 0:2:40,379
ECOSYSTEMS ARE THE INTERACTING SYSTEM THAT
INVOLVES


35
0:2:40,379 --> 0:2:42,51
BOTH OF LIVING ORGANISMS, IN OTHER WORDS,
THE


36
0:2:42,51 --> 0:2:50,69
POPULATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE NON LIVING
 ENVIRONMENT. OKAY. SO THE INTERACTION IS


37
0:2:50,69 --> 0:2:50,709
VERY


38
0:2:50,709 --> 0:2:54,43
INTEREST IN THAT IT HAS A VERY, VERY SET DIRECTIONAL


39
0:2:54,43 --> 0:2:58,64
COMPONENT. FOR EXAMPLE, ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH
THE


40
0:2:58,64 --> 0:3:3,68
ECOSYSTEM. IT FLOWS FROM THE PRIMARY PRODUCERS
TO THE


41
0:3:3,68 --> 0:3:6,23
CONSUMERS TO THE PREDATORS. SO THERE IS THE
FLOW OF


42
0:3:6,23 --> 0:3:11,56
ENERGY. BUT, THERE IS THE CYCLING OF NUTRIENTS.
AND


43
0:3:11,56 --> 0:3:14,79
THIS CYCLING OF NUTRIENTS AND THE FLOW OF
ENERGY IS


44
0:3:14,79 --> 0:3:17,56
REGULATED. IT IS REGULATED AS A FUNCTION OF
THE


45
0:3:17,56 --> 0:3:20,349
ECOSYSTEM. SO, WE ARE GOING TO TALK A LOT
ABOUT


46
0:3:20,349 --> 0:3:24,51
CYCLING OF NUTRIENTS TODAY. AND, WHY THIS
IS


47
0:3:24,51 --> 0:3:27,12
IMPORTANT, CYCLING OF NUTRIENTS, BECAUSE IF
YOU THINK


48
0:3:27,12 --> 0:3:32,109
OF CARBON DIOXIDE OR NITROGEN OR OXYGEN OR
WATER, THIS


49
0:3:32,109 --> 0:3:35,81
IS REALLY THE SOURCE OF ALL OF THE CARBON,
OXYGEN,


50
0:3:35,81 --> 0:3:40,9
HYDROGEN, NITROGEN COMPOUNDS THAT WE USE IN
MAKES


51
0:3:40,9 --> 0:3:45,79
PROTEINS AND MAKING AMINO ACIDS IN OUR OWN
BODIES. SO


52
0:3:45,79 --> 0:3:51,79
HYDROGEN IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF
ATP. AS


53
0:3:51,79 --> 0:3:56,459
YOU ALL KNOW IN THE GLYCOLYSIS REACTIONS.
SO, THESE


54
0:3:56,459 --> 0:4:0,48
CARBON DIOXIDE, NITROGEN, OXYGEN, THEY REALLY
ARE ONLY


55
0:4:0,48 --> 0:4:4,549
 IN GASEOUS FORMS. WATER, AS YOU KNOW, GOES
FROM


56
0:4:4,549 --> 0:4:7,92
A LIQUID TO A GASEOUS FORM. BUT, EVERYTHING
ELSE THAT


57
0:4:7,92 --> 0:4:11,709
WE USE, EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE NEED COMES
FROM THE


58
0:4:11,709 --> 0:4:16,299
EARTH'S CRUST. SO, ALL OF THE MICRONUTRIENTS,
ALL OF


59
0:4:16,299 --> 0:4:18,819
THE MACRO NUTRIENTS, SUCH AS THE ONES THAT
YOU PUT UP


60
0:4:18,819 --> 0:4:22,52
THERE, THE MOST OBVIOUS, CALCIUM, SODIUM,
MAGNESIUM.


61
0:4:22,52 --> 0:4:26,75
MANGANESE, PHOSPHORUS. THEY ALL COME FROM
THE EARTH'S


62
0:4:26,75 --> 0:4:31,36
CRUST. SO IT IS ONLY THE CARBON DIOXIDE, NITROGEN,


63
0:4:31,36 --> 0:4:33,37
OXYGEN THAT WE DEPEND ON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE.
AND WE


64
0:4:33,37 --> 0:4:36,65
WILL GO INTO THOSE IN DETAIL. LIKEWISE, THESE


65
0:4:36,65 --> 0:4:39,99
MICRONUTRIENTS LIKE SELENIUM AND MOLYBDENUM
THEY COME


66
0:4:39,99 --> 0:4:42,25
FROM THE EARTH'S CRUST AS WELL. THAT IS WHERE
WE GET


67
0:4:42,25 --> 0:4:45,53
THOSE FROM. SO, LET'S KIND OF LOOK AT ENERGY


68
0:4:45,53 --> 0:4:48,93
TRANSFER. THE WHOLE PROCESS OF ENERGY TRANSFER.
WE


69
0:4:48,93 --> 0:4:52,59
KNOW FROM WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT ON WEDNESDAY
IS THAT


70
0:4:52,59 --> 0:4:55,949
ABOUT 1 PERCENT OF THE SUNLIGHT THAT FALLS
ON LEAVES


71
0:4:55,949 --> 0:4:59,33
AND STEMS ENDS UP GETTING INCORPORATED INTO
PLANT


72
0:4:59,33 --> 0:5:4,28
BODIES. THIS IS ABOUT 1 PERCENT. NOW, BUT,
THAT 1


73
0:5:4,28 --> 0:5:7,5
 PERCENT THAT IS IN THE INCORPORATED FROM
THE SUNLIGHT


74
0:5:7,5 --> 0:5:11,59
INTO THE PLANT BODY, THERE IS A TRANSFER TO
THE


75
0:5:11,59 --> 0:5:14,96
CONSUMER TO IS HERBIVORE THAT FEEDS ON THAT
PLANT.


76
0:5:14,96 --> 0:5:19,15
AND THE TRANSFER IS ABOUT 10 PERCENT. IT IS
ABOUT


77
0:5:19,15 --> 0:5:23,69
A 10 PERCENT TRANSFER. NOW, IF YOU LOOK AT
THE


78
0:5:23,69 --> 0:5:28,69
TRANSFER OF ENERGY, WE CAN THINK OF IT AS
CALORIES OR


79
0:5:28,69 --> 0:5:36,5
POUNDS, FROM OUR PRIMARY PRODUCER TO OUR SECONDARY,


80
0:5:36,5 --> 0:5:40,479
NOT PRODUCERS, OUR SECONDARY PRODUCTION, WHICH
ARE THE


81
0:5:40,479 --> 0:5:44,349
CONSUMERS AND THE PREDATORS, THAT IS ABOUT
10 PERCENT,


82
0:5:44,349 --> 0:5:47,47
AS WELL. SO, REMEMBER, PRIMARY PRODUCTION
IS THE RATE


83
0:5:47,47 --> 0:5:50,12
OF ACCUMULATION OF BIOMASS BY PLANTS. SECONDARY


84
0:5:50,12 --> 0:5:52,56
PRODUCTION IS THE RATE OF ACCUMULATION OF
BIOMASS BY


85
0:5:52,56 --> 0:5:58,69
CONSUMERS AND BY PREDATORS. SO, THIS 10 PERCENT


86
0:5:58,69 --> 0:6:1,569
TRANSFER IS ACTUALLY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
FOR ONE


87
0:6:1,569 --> 0:6:5,59
THING, IT IS REAL. IT REALLY DOES HAVE ABOUT
A 10


88
0:6:5,59 --> 0:6:7,629
PERCENT EFFICIENCY OF TRANSFER. AND WHAT IS


89
0:6:7,629 --> 0:6:9,289
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS, THIS WAS A VERY
THEORETICAL


90
0:6:9,289 --> 0:6:13,569
IDEA THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN THE 30'S THAT THE
 EFFICIENCY OF ONE TRANSFER FROM ONE TROPHIC


91
0:6:13,569 --> 0:6:14,229
LEVEL TO


92
0:6:14,229 --> 0:6:17,75
THE OTHER WAS ABOUT 10 PERCENT. AND IN THE
90'S THEY


93
0:6:17,75 --> 0:6:20,65
DID THESE WORLDWIDE FISHERY STUDIES WHERE
THEY LOOKED


94
0:6:20,65 --> 0:6:23,5
AT AREA THAT HAD PRIMARY PRODUCERS, IN OTHER
WORDS,


95
0:6:23,5 --> 0:6:26,349
DIATOMS AND ALGAE. AREAS THAT ARE PRIMARY
CONSUMERS.


96
0:6:26,349 --> 0:6:28,83
FISH THAT WERE FEEDING ON THEM. AREAS THAT
HAD


97
0:6:28,83 --> 0:6:31,52
PREDATORS. AND THEY FOUND THAT IT WAS INCREDIBLY


98
0:6:31,52 --> 0:6:35,47
CLOSE TO 10 PERCENT. MAYBE FROM AROUND 9 TO
11 IN THE


99
0:6:35,47 --> 0:6:37,97
SYSTEM'S THAT THEY LOOKED AT. SO, THIS IS
REAL. AND


100
0:6:37,97 --> 0:6:42,11
SO THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS IS, IF YOU HAVE
100 OR SAY


101
0:6:42,11 --> 0:6:47,319
A THOUSAND POUNDS OF GRASS OR VEGETATION,
YOU CAN


102
0:6:47,319 --> 0:6:50,75
PRODUCE ABOUT 100 PONDS OF PRIMARY CONSUMER
AND YOU


103
0:6:50,75 --> 0:6:54,37
CAN PRODUCE ABOUT 10 POUNDS OF PREDATOR. OKAY?
SO


104
0:6:54,37 --> 0:6:57,139
THERE IS THAT 10 PERCENT TRANSFER FROM ONE
TROPHIC


105
0:6:57,139 --> 0:6:59,65
LEVEL TO THE OTHER. SO ABOUT A THOUSAND POUNDS
OF


106
0:6:59,65 --> 0:7:3,879
PRIMARY PRODUCTION PRODUCES 100 POUNDS OF
PRIMARY


107
0:7:3,879 --> 0:7:7,639
CONSUMER AND ABOUT 10 POUNDS OF SECONDARY
CONSUMER.


108
0:7:7,639 --> 0:7:10,589
OKAY? SO THAT IS REALLY VERY, VERY INTERESTING
THAT


109
0:7:10,589 --> 0:7:16,5
 THAT WORKS. NOW, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BIOCHEMICAL


110
0:7:16,5 --> 0:7:18,44
CYCLES, AND WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THINGS
THAT


111
0:7:18,44 --> 0:7:21,46
INVOLVE OUR OWN BODIES. THESE ARE OUR OWN
BODIES AS


112
0:7:21,46 --> 0:7:26,199
WELL. WE LOOK AT HOW THIS WORKS. SO, INITIALLY,
WE


113
0:7:26,199 --> 0:7:30,8
HAVE AN ELEMENT, WHETHER IT BE CARBON, OXYGEN,


114
0:7:30,8 --> 0:7:34,919
NITROGEN, MOLYBDENUM, PHOSPHORUS. IT IS INCORPORATED


115
0:7:34,919 --> 0:7:38,449
FROM THE ATMOSPHERE IF IT IS ONE OF THE GASSES
OR IT


116
0:7:38,449 --> 0:7:43,159
IS INCORPORATED FROM WEATHERED ROCK INTO PLANT
BODIES.


117
0:7:43,159 --> 0:7:47,439
OKAY? FROM PLANT BODIES IT GOES TO ANIMAL
BODIES AND


118
0:7:47,439 --> 0:7:50,919
THEN THROUGH FOOD WEBS. WE USED TO SAY A FOOD
CHAIN,


119
0:7:50,919 --> 0:7:53,159
BUT ACTUALLY NOW WE THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF
FOOD WEBS.


120
0:7:53,159 --> 0:7:57,12
WITH MUCH MORE COMPLEXITY AND MUCH DIFFERENT
LEVELS.


121
0:7:57,12 --> 0:8:0,659
AND THEN OF COURSE, THESE ORGANISMS DIE AND
THEN


122
0:8:0,659 --> 0:8:3,71
THROUGH DECOMPOSITION IT GOES BACK TO THE
NON-LIVING


123
0:8:3,71 --> 0:8:6,59
WORLD. THE OLD DUST TO DUST IDEA. IT REALLY
WORKS


124
0:8:6,59 --> 0:8:9,74
VERY, VERY WELL IN A WAY OF THINKING OF THIS,
THIS


125
0:8:9,74 --> 0:8:13,4
IDEA. OKAY? SO, EVERYTHING WE HAVE HERE YOU


126
0:8:13,4 --> 0:8:16,58
PROBABLY KNOW ALREADY. LET'S LOOK AT A FEW
OF THE


127
0:8:16,58 --> 0:8:21,509
 CYCLES. OKAY? FOR EXAMPLE, THE CARBON, ALL
CARBON


128
0:8:21,509 --> 0:8:25,52
IN OUR BODIES. ALL CARBON IN LIVING THINGS
COMES


129
0:8:25,52 --> 0:8:29,889
THROUGH ONE DIRECT PATH. AND THAT IS A PATH
THAT IS


130
0:8:29,889 --> 0:8:33,1
INVOLVES CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE.
NOW, YOU


131
0:8:33,1 --> 0:8:36,56
KNOW THAT CARBON DIOXIDE IS ABOUT .03 PERCENT
OF THE


132
0:8:36,56 --> 0:8:39,579
GASSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE. OKAY? WE KNOW THAT
IT IS


133
0:8:39,579 --> 0:8:42,209
RISING AND IT CHANGES. BUT, IT TOOK, YOU KNOW
ROUGHLY


134
0:8:42,209 --> 0:8:46,19
LET'S THINK OF IT THAT WAY. NOW, THE AUTOTROPHIC


135
0:8:46,19 --> 0:8:48,63
ORGANISMS AND WHAT ARE AUTOTROPHIC ORGANISMS?


136
0:8:48,63 --> 0:8:51,8
PLANTS. THAT IS WHEN WE SAY AUTOTROPHIC WE
MEAN


137
0:8:51,8 --> 0:8:56,51
PLANTS. AUTO, SELF. TROPHIC, FEEDING. WHEN
WE TALK


138
0:8:56,51 --> 0:8:59,55
ABOUT ANIMALS THAT EAT PLANTS WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT


139
0:8:59,55 --> 0:9:2,51
HETEROTROPHIC. HETERO MEANS OTHER. TROPHIC
MEANS


140
0:9:2,51 --> 0:9:5,7
FEEDING, OTHER FEEDING. SO WHAT WE HAVE IN
THE CARBON


141
0:9:5,7 --> 0:9:8,36
DIOXIDE CYCLE IS THESE AUTOTROPHIC ORGANISMS.
FIX


142
0:9:8,36 --> 0:9:12,35
ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF THE ATMOSPHERIC CO2 PER
YEAR. YOU


143
0:9:12,35 --> 0:9:15,529
PROBABLY HAD ALL OF THIS IN HIGH SCHOOL. SO
WE WILL


144
0:9:15,529 --> 0:9:21,2
GO OVER REASONABLY BRIEF. AND THEN THE HETEROTROPHS
 GET ALL THEIR CARBON FROM THEIR AUTOTROPHS


145
0:9:21,2 --> 0:9:21,64
BY FEEDING


146
0:9:21,64 --> 0:9:23,26
ON THE AUTOTROPHS. BUT THE ONLY IMPLEMENTATION
THAT


147
0:9:23,26 --> 0:9:26,44
THEY CAN GET CARBON IS FROM FEEDING ON THE
AUTOTROPHS


148
0:9:26,44 --> 0:9:30,41
OR FROM, IF IT IS A SECONDARY CONSUMER, FEEDING
ON THE


149
0:9:30,41 --> 0:9:33,62
PRIMARY CONSUMERS. NOW, OF COURSE, WE KNOW
THAT


150
0:9:33,62 --> 0:9:37,5
BODIES WHETHER THEY BE PLANTS OR ANIMALS,
DECOMPOSE


151
0:9:37,5 --> 0:9:40,39
AND THEY GO BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE. THE BODIES


152
0:9:40,39 --> 0:9:43,89
DECOMPOSE AND THE CO2 GOES BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE
AND


153
0:9:43,89 --> 0:9:47,79
THEN IT GETS OR IT GETS REINCORPORATED INTO
THE BODY


154
0:9:47,79 --> 0:9:50,64
OF HETEROTROPHS IF THE HETEROTROPHS ARE ACTUALLY
DOING


155
0:9:50,64 --> 0:9:53,36
THE FEEDING. BUT EVENTUALLY ALL GOES BACK
INTO THE


156
0:9:53,36 --> 0:9:55,99
ATMOSPHERE. THE AUTOTROPHS DIE FIRST IT GOES
RIGHT


157
0:9:55,99 --> 0:9:59,5
BACK. IF THEY ARE EATEN BY THE HETEROTROPHS
IT GOES


158
0:9:59,5 --> 0:10:1,26
BACK WHEN THE HETEROTROPHS DIE. IT ALL GOES
BACK.


159
0:10:1,26 --> 0:10:4,57
THERE IS CYCLING. THERE IS CYCLING OF CARBON
DIOXIDE


160
0:10:4,57 --> 0:10:8,98
THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE. NOW, WE HAVE A COMPOUND
THAT


161
0:10:8,98 --> 0:10:13,76
WE CALL CELLULOSE WHICH YOU KNOW FROM DR.
FELDMAN.


162
0:10:13,76 --> 0:10:17,3
CELLULOSE IS A COMPOUND THAT BREAKS DOWN VERY,
VERY


163
0:10:17,3 --> 0:10:20,459
 SLOWLY. AND OFTEN TIMES GETTING INCORPORATED
BELOW


164
0:10:20,459 --> 0:10:24,32
THE SOIL. SO WE TALK ABOUT FOSSIL FUELS. FOSSIL


165
0:10:24,32 --> 0:10:28,2
FUELS BEING OIL, WHICH COMES FROM CELLULOSE
OR FROM OR


166
0:10:28,2 --> 0:10:30,529
COAL WHICH COMES FROM CELLULOSE. THAT IS WHY
WE TALK


167
0:10:30,529 --> 0:10:33,899
ABOUT THAT. SO, A LOT OF THE CARBON DIOXIDE
THAT


168
0:10:33,899 --> 0:10:36,18
DOESN'T GO BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE BECAUSE
OF THIS SLOW


169
0:10:36,18 --> 0:10:40,149
BREAKDOWN OF PLANTS, OF SOME PLANTS ENDS UP
BEING


170
0:10:40,149 --> 0:10:43,709
INCORPORATED AS FOSSIL, FOSSIL FUELS. AND
OF COURSE,


171
0:10:43,709 --> 0:10:46,67
THE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS IS WHAT INCREASES
THE


172
0:10:46,67 --> 0:10:52,72
AMOUNT OF CO2 IN THE ATMOSPHERE. NOW, A LOT
OF CARBON


173
0:10:52,72 --> 0:10:57,639
IS ALSO STORED IN CORAL REEFS THAT TEND TO
BE IN THE


174
0:10:57,639 --> 0:10:59,45
TROPICAL AREAS OF THE WORLD THAT IS FREE OF
FRESH


175
0:10:59,45 --> 0:11:4,5
WATER, FREE OF SEDIMENTATION. AND THEY ARE


176
0:11:4,5 --> 0:11:8,72
INCORPORATED AS CALCIUM CARBONATE, AS CALCIUM


177
0:11:8,72 --> 0:11:10,99
CARBONATE. NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS
REALLY


178
0:11:10,99 --> 0:11:14,389
INTERESTING ABOUT CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE CYCLING,
IS


179
0:11:14,389 --> 0:11:17,43
WHY AND A LOT OF IT TENDS TO REGULATE THE
AMOUNT OF


180
0:11:17,43 --> 0:11:21,239
CARBON DIOXIDE, IS THAT THERE ARE TREMENDOUS
SOURCES


181
0:11:21,239 --> 0:11:23,779
 OF CARBON DIOXIDE THAT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT.


182
0:11:23,779 --> 0:11:27,36
OKAY. THAT JUST HAPPEN. AND LARGELY FROM


183
0:11:27,36 --> 0:11:31,709
DECOMPOSITION OF PROCESSES OR FROM DIGESTION,
FROM


184
0:11:31,709 --> 0:11:35,4
METABOLISM. AND ONE OF THE HUGE SOURCES, AND
IT HAS


185
0:11:35,4 --> 0:11:36,68
BEEN ARGUED THAT IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
SOURCES IN


186
0:11:36,68 --> 0:11:41,57
THE WORLD, ARE TERMITES. TERMITES, NOW WE
TEND TO


187
0:11:41,57 --> 0:11:44,82
THINK TERMITES AREN'T THAT BIG AN ISSUE HERE.


188
0:11:44,82 --> 0:11:47,5
ALTHOUGH, AFTER THE FIRST RAINS COME OFTEN
TIMES YOU


189
0:11:47,5 --> 0:11:50,79
SEE THE TERMITES EMERGING FROM THE GROUND
OR FROM


190
0:11:50,79 --> 0:11:53,6
HOPEFULLY NOT FROM YOUR HOUSE AND FLYING AROUND.
BUT


191
0:11:53,6 --> 0:11:55,69
TERMITES, BECAUSE OF BACTERIA, SYMBIOTIC BACTERIA
IN


192
0:11:55,69 --> 0:12:0,18
THEIR GUT CAN BREAK DOWN CELLULOSE AND THROUGH
THEIR


193
0:12:0,18 --> 0:12:5,87
DIGESTION OR PARTIAL DIGESTION, THEY RELEASE
CARBON


194
0:12:5,87 --> 0:12:9,44
DIOXIDE TO THE ATMOSPHERE. ONE OF THE BIG
PROBLEMS,


195
0:12:9,44 --> 0:12:12,38
AND MAYBE IN SOME WAYS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
OF CUTTING


196
0:12:12,38 --> 0:12:15,91
DOWN RAIN FORESTS, BECAUSE TERMITES REALLY
THRIVE IN


197
0:12:15,91 --> 0:12:19,7
THE TROPICS, IS THAT YOU LEAVE A LOT OF SLASH,
YOU


198
0:12:19,7 --> 0:12:21,96
LEAVE A LOT OF MATERIAL ON THE BOTTOM. IT
IS NOT, IT


199
0:12:21,96 --> 0:12:25,25
 IS NOT IN A BIG CHUNK, BUT IT IS SMALLER
CHUNKS SO YOU


200
0:12:25,25 --> 0:12:29,279
HAVE A HIGHER SURFACE TO VOLUME RATIO TO IS
IDEAL FOOD


201
0:12:29,279 --> 0:12:33,67
FOR TERMITES. TERMITES TO PRODUCE EVEN MORE
CARBON


202
0:12:33,67 --> 0:12:35,55
DIOXIDE. SO, ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE TALK
ABOUT


203
0:12:35,55 --> 0:12:38,8
REGULATING INDUSTRIAL CARBON DIOXIDE IS BECAUSE
YOU


204
0:12:38,8 --> 0:12:42,22
HAVE GOT HUGE SOURCES OF CARBON DIOXIDE LIKE
TERMITES


205
0:12:42,22 --> 0:12:45,22
THAT YOU CAN'T REGULATE. THAT IS WHY THERE
IS THE


206
0:12:45,22 --> 0:12:48,519
EMPHASIS. WE ARE NOT CERTAINLY, IT IS NOT
THE,


207
0:12:48,519 --> 0:12:51,13
INDUSTRIAL CARBON DIOXIDE IS A PROCESSES ARE
NOT THE


208
0:12:51,13 --> 0:12:53,23
ONLY SOURCE OF CARBON DIOXIDE, BUT IT IS THE
ONE THAT


209
0:12:53,23 --> 0:12:55,779
IS MOST EASILY REGULATED. TERMITES ARE VIRTUALLY


210
0:12:55,779 --> 0:12:58,899
IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY MAKE UP,
TERMITES AND


211
0:12:58,899 --> 0:13:1,839
ANTS, PROBABLY MAKE UP THE LARGEST BIOMASS
OF ANY


212
0:13:1,839 --> 0:13:4,41
ORGANISMS IN THE WORLD. IF YOU LUMP THEM TOGETHER


213
0:13:4,41 --> 0:13:7,54
BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST HUGE NUMBERS. ALL RIGHT.
SO


214
0:13:7,54 --> 0:13:12,55
THAT IS CARBON DIOXIDE. NOW, NITROGEN IS A
LITTLE


215
0:13:12,55 --> 0:13:16,51
MORE COMPLEX A TOPIC. NITROGEN IS A LITTLE
MORE


216
0:13:16,51 --> 0:13:18,519
COMPLEX. I WILL SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME GOING
OVER


217
0:13:18,519 --> 0:13:22,89
 THIS. NITROGEN, AS YOU KNOW, MAKES UP ABOUT
78


218
0:13:22,89 --> 0:13:27,8
PERCENT ATMOSPHERIC GASSES. THE PROBLEM IS,
IS UNLIKE


219
0:13:27,8 --> 0:13:30,92
CARBON DIOXIDE, WHICH IS READILY USED IN THE


220
0:13:30,92 --> 0:13:34,449
PHOTOSYNTHETIC PROCESS WHERE PLANTS TAKE UP
CARBON


221
0:13:34,449 --> 0:13:38,3
DIOXIDE INCORPORATE CARBOHYDRATES INTO THEIR
BODY AND


222
0:13:38,3 --> 0:13:41,16
RELEASE OXYGEN. NITROGEN GAS CAN'T BE TAKEN
UP BY


223
0:13:41,16 --> 0:13:45,89
PLANTS. NITROGEN CAN'T BE TAKEN UP BY PLANTS.
THE


224
0:13:45,89 --> 0:13:47,709
FORMS OF NITROGEN THAT CAN BE TAKEN UP BY
PLANTS ARE


225
0:13:47,709 --> 0:13:52,16
AMMONIUM AND H4 AND THAT IS NOT REALLY EASILY
TAKEN UP


226
0:13:52,16 --> 0:13:54,41
BY PLANTS. THEY CAN TAKE IT UP BUT THEY DON'T
TAKE IT


227
0:13:54,41 --> 0:13:59,209
UP VERY WELL. AND THE OTHER IS NITRATE. NITRATE
NO


228
0:13:59,209 --> 0:14:3,92
3. WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS, THE ATMOSPHERIC
NITROGEN


229
0:14:3,92 --> 0:14:8,6
HAS TO BE INCORPORATED INTO A AMMONIUM OR
INTO NITRATE


230
0:14:8,6 --> 0:14:12,149
BEFORE PLANTS CAN USE IT. THIS IS REALLY A
VERY, VERY


231
0:14:12,149 --> 0:14:16,329
IMPORTANT PROCESS. NOW, THE WAY THIS TENDS
TO HAPPEN


232
0:14:16,329 --> 0:14:21,19
IS THAT THERE ARE ON EITHER FREE-LIVING IN
THE SOIL OR


233
0:14:21,19 --> 0:14:25,68
ON THE ROOTS OF PLANTS SYMBIOTICALLY, THERE
ARE


234
0:14:25,68 --> 0:14:31,67
BACTERIA THAT ACTUALLY ENABLE THIS TRANSFER
OF FREE


235
0:14:31,67 --> 0:14:37,5
 NITROGEN N2 TO USE NITRITE, N02 AND THEN
TO NITRATE,


236
0:14:37,5 --> 0:14:41,81
N03. THEY ARE ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO THE PROCESS
OF


237
0:14:41,81 --> 0:14:45,889
PLANTS GETTING NITROGEN AS A NUTRIENT. THESE
BACTERIA


238
0:14:45,889 --> 0:14:50,4
THAT PROCESS THE ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN AND
CONVERT IT


239
0:14:50,4 --> 0:14:53,38
IN TO FORMS THAT PLANTS CAN USE. THERE IS
SOME MINOR


240
0:14:53,38 --> 0:14:59,17
SOURCES OF USEABLE NITRATE, IN THAT ABOUT
5 TO 10


241
0:14:59,17 --> 0:15:3,1
PERCENT OF THE NITROGEN THAT CAN BE USED BY
PLANTS


242
0:15:3,1 --> 0:15:7,56
COMES THROUGH FROM THE ATMOSPHERE EITHER AS
DISSOLVED


243
0:15:7,56 --> 0:15:11,769
IN RAIN WATER OR ADHERING TO DUST PARTICLES.
SO THAT


244
0:15:11,769 --> 0:15:15,259
IS A SOURCE OF NITROGEN. BUT, NOWHERE NEAR
AS


245
0:15:15,259 --> 0:15:19,97
IMPORTANT AS NITROGEN FIXATION. IN FERTILIZERS
WE


246
0:15:19,97 --> 0:15:25,73
HAVE ACTUALLY THE INDUSTRIAL CREATION OF NITRATES.


247
0:15:25,73 --> 0:15:29,589
SOMETIMES AMMONIUM. BUT, THIS AGAIN IS A RELATIVELY


248
0:15:29,589 --> 0:15:34,63
SMALL PART COMPARED TO THE BACTERIA AND ITS
ROLE IN,


249
0:15:34,63 --> 0:15:38,449
IN NITRIFICATION. NOW, DENITRIFICATION,


250
0:15:38,449 --> 0:15:42,75
NITRIFICATION. NOW, AS WE HAVE NITROGEN FIXATION


251
0:15:42,75 --> 0:15:47,18
GOING ON FROM FREE LIVING AND ON THE BACTERIAL
PLANT,


252
0:15:47,18 --> 0:15:54,209
ON THE PLANT ROOTS BY BACTERIA, WE ALSO HAVE
 DECOMPOSITION. THE PLANTS DIE. AND ONE OF


253
0:15:54,209 --> 0:15:54,54
THE THINGS


254
0:15:54,54 --> 0:15:56,94
THAT IS VERY INTERESTING IS THAT WE GET A
TREMENDOUS


255
0:15:56,94 --> 0:16:2,9
AMOUNT OF FROM DECOMPOSITION, THE REABSORPTION
OF


256
0:16:2,9 --> 0:16:5,31
THESE NITROGENOUS COMPOUNDS THAT CAN BE USED
BY


257
0:16:5,31 --> 0:16:8,68
PLANTS. WHETHER IT BE AMMONIUM OR NITRATE.
SO THERE


258
0:16:8,68 --> 0:16:11,56
IS A LOT OF RECYCLING IN THIS SOIL. AND THIS
REALLY


259
0:16:11,56 --> 0:16:14,819
WASN'T VERY WELL KNOWN UNTIL RECENTLY. AND
THEN, WE


260
0:16:14,819 --> 0:16:17,819
HAVE A PROCESS, THIS IS A TERM THAT I JUST
USED OF


261
0:16:17,819 --> 0:16:24,36
NITRIFICATION WHERE WE TAKE AMMONIUM, THE
PARTICLE


262
0:16:24,36 --> 0:16:29,19
THAT IS NOT SUPER ABLE TO BE USED BY PLANTS
INTO


263
0:16:29,19 --> 0:16:35,509
NITRITE, N02 AND INTO NITRATE, N03. YOU ARE
ACTUALLY


264
0:16:35,509 --> 0:16:40,41
USING YOUR CHEM 1. AND, THEN, DENITRIFICATION
IS THE


265
0:16:40,41 --> 0:16:43,75
REVERSE OF THIS, WHERE WE GO FROM NO3 TO NO2
TO


266
0:16:43,75 --> 0:16:48,55
AMMONIUM BACK TO ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN. OKAY?
SO, I


267
0:16:48,55 --> 0:16:53,38
HAVE QUICKLY GONE OVER THESE CARBON DIOXIDE
AND SPEND


268
0:16:53,38 --> 0:16:57,16
A LITTLE MORE TIME ON NITROGEN. AND OF ALL
OF THE


269
0:16:57,16 --> 0:16:59,399
MINERAL ELEMENTS, I AM ONLY GOING TO GO OVER
ONE


270
0:16:59,399 --> 0:17:2,22
BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY OF MOST IMPORTANT.
AND THAT IS


271
0:17:2,22 --> 0:17:9,6
 PHOSPHORUS. BUT, THIS IS REALLY A PATTERN
VERY, VERY


272
0:17:9,6 --> 0:17:12,47
SIMPLE. A VERY SIMILAR TO ALL OF THE OTHER
ELEMENTS


273
0:17:12,47 --> 0:17:15,75
THAT WE GET FROM WEATHERED ROCKS, THE WAY
THIS WORKS.


274
0:17:15,75 --> 0:17:19,86
WHAT HAPPENS TO PHOSPHORUS IS THAT IT IS,
IT IS ALL IN


275
0:17:19,86 --> 0:17:22,86
A MINERAL FORM. THERE IS NO GASEOUS PHOSPHORUS
OR NO


276
0:17:22,86 --> 0:17:26,83
GASEOUS PHOSPHATE. IT IS ALL MINERAL. SO,
IT TENDS,


277
0:17:26,83 --> 0:17:30,86
BECAUSE OF THE WEATHERING, BECAUSE OF RAIN,
IT TENDS


278
0:17:30,86 --> 0:17:34,11
TO GET LEECHED OUT OF THE SOIL AND THEN CARRIED
IN


279
0:17:34,11 --> 0:17:38,64
WATER TO RIVERS. CARRIED IN WATER TO RIVERS.
FROM


280
0:17:38,64 --> 0:17:42,59
THE RIVERS IT FLOWS INTO THE OCEANS. AND,
WHAT IT


281
0:17:42,59 --> 0:17:46,65
DOES, IT TENDS TO SETTLE EITHER ON THE BOTTOM
OR


282
0:17:46,65 --> 0:17:49,88
THROUGH MIXING PROCESSES GETTING INCORPORATED
INTO


283
0:17:49,88 --> 0:17:53,86
PLANT BODIES AND THEN BEING EATEN BY FISH,


284
0:17:53,86 --> 0:17:57,39
INVERTEBRATES WHO ARE THEN EATEN BY BIRDS.
BUT IT IS


285
0:17:57,39 --> 0:18:1,53
STILL, IT IS IN THIS MINERAL FORM. NOW, THE
ONLY WAY


286
0:18:1,53 --> 0:18:6,0
WE CAN GET IT BACK FROM THE OCEAN IS WE EITHER
MINE


287
0:18:6,0 --> 0:18:9,3
IT. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR THOSE OF YOU FROM
SAN


288
0:18:9,3 --> 0:18:11,73
FRANCISCO, YOU GO OUT TO OCEAN BEACH AND YOU
CAN SEE


289
0:18:11,73 --> 0:18:16,34
 THESE ROCKS COMPLETELY WHITE FROM BIRD DROPPINGS.


290
0:18:16,34 --> 0:18:19,45
VERY OFTEN PEOPLE GO TO ISLANDS WHERE THERE
IS A LOT


291
0:18:19,45 --> 0:18:23,13
OF BIRDS AND THEY LITERALLY MINE THE PHOSPHATE
FROM


292
0:18:23,13 --> 0:18:27,76
THAT BECAUSE IT IS IN A FORM THAT CAN BE USED
IN


293
0:18:27,76 --> 0:18:30,89
AGRICULTURAL. OR THE ONLY OTHER WAY THAT IT
CAN COME


294
0:18:30,89 --> 0:18:35,58
BACK TO THE LAND, IS THAT IT COMES BACK BY
LAND BEING


295
0:18:35,58 --> 0:18:39,48
UPLIFTED. IN OTHER WORDS, SEA BOTTOM RISING
TO THE


296
0:18:39,48 --> 0:18:45,17
SURFACE. NOW, CALIFORNIA IS, THE COAST OF
CALIFORNIA


297
0:18:45,17 --> 0:18:49,34
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY, IS UPLIFTED OCEAN BOTTOM.
IS


298
0:18:49,34 --> 0:18:52,1
UPLIFTED OCEAN BOTTOM. SO WE HAVE VERY HIGH


299
0:18:52,1 --> 0:18:57,44
CONCENTRATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS HERE BECAUSE
OF THE


300
0:18:57,44 --> 0:19:1,8
UPLIFTING THAT OCCURRED IN GEOLOGIC TIME.
BUT UNLESS


301
0:19:1,8 --> 0:19:4,87
YOU HAVE THAT UPLIFTING YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH


302
0:19:4,87 --> 0:19:8,92
PHOSPHORUS UNLESS YOU CAN GET IT FROM MINING
SOURCES.


303
0:19:8,92 --> 0:19:11,92
SO, IF YOU THINK BACK TO THE EXPERIMENT THAT
I SHOWED


304
0:19:11,92 --> 0:19:15,4
YOU WHERE THE LAKE WAS SPLIT IN HALF, AND
THEY WERE


305
0:19:15,4 --> 0:19:17,96
LOOKING AT THE EFFECT OF PHOSPHORUS ADDITION,
THEY


306
0:19:17,96 --> 0:19:21,17
ADDED PHOSPHORUS TO ONE SIDE OF THE LAKE AND
NOT TO


307
0:19:21,17 --> 0:19:23,25
 THE OTHER AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE


308
0:19:23,25 --> 0:19:26,62
SIDE OF THE LAKE THEY ADDED PHOSPHORUS? IT
TURNED


309
0:19:26,62 --> 0:19:30,77
BRIGHT GREEN BECAUSE OF ALGAL BLOOMS. SO,
THAT


310
0:19:30,77 --> 0:19:34,53
EXPERIMENT WHERE THEY ADD PHOSPHORUS TO ONE
SIDE AND


311
0:19:34,53 --> 0:19:37,42
NOT TO THE OTHER AND YOU GET A RESPONSE OF
ALGAE, IS


312
0:19:37,42 --> 0:19:41,41
DEMONSTRATING THAT PHOSPHORUS IS A LIMITING
FACTOR.


313
0:19:41,41 --> 0:19:44,45
OKAY? THERE IS NOT ENOUGH PHOSPHORUS IN THE
SYSTEM


314
0:19:44,45 --> 0:19:47,59
SO AS SOON AS THEY ADD THE PHOSPHORUS IN,
THEY GET


315
0:19:47,59 --> 0:19:52,0
A WONDERFUL RESPONSE INDICATING THAT PHOSPHORUS
IS THE


316
0:19:52,0 --> 0:19:55,38
LIMITING FACTOR. OKAY. BEFORE I GO ON TO THE
NEXT


317
0:19:55,38 --> 0:19:58,76
TOPIC, I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS
THIS.


318
0:19:58,76 --> 0:20:2,25
OKAY? WE TALKED ABOUT ECOSYSTEMS, WE HAVE
TALKED


319
0:20:2,25 --> 0:20:6,6
ABOUT THE FLOW OF ENERGY IN THE CYCLING OF
NUTRIENTS.


320
0:20:6,6 --> 0:20:10,6
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ENERGY TRANSFER. WE HAVE
TALKED


321
0:20:10,6 --> 0:20:13,79
ABOUT CARBON DIOXIDE, WATER CYCLES, NITROGEN
CYCLES,


322
0:20:13,79 --> 0:20:16,71
PHOSPHORUS CYCLES. ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
OR


323
0:20:16,71 --> 0:20:26,51
ANYTHING THAT THEY WANT ME TO GO OVER?


324
0:20:26,51 --> 0:20:31,5
IS THAT EQUAL? NO. NO. NO. TWO DIFFERENT
 PROCESSES. NITRIFICATION WE HAVE AMMONIUM


325
0:20:31,5 --> 0:20:32,33
GOING TO


326
0:20:32,33 --> 0:20:34,83
NITRITE GOING TO NITRATE. BECAUSE, NITRATE
IS THE


327
0:20:34,83 --> 0:20:38,87
FORM THAT IS MOST USEABLE BY PLANTS. THE OTHER


328
0:20:38,87 --> 0:20:45,67
DIRECTION WOULD BE DENITRIFICATION. SO, IF
YOU THINK,


329
0:20:45,67 --> 0:20:49,8
DE, MEANS FROM. YOU ARE EITHER NITRIFYING
OR


330
0:20:49,8 --> 0:20:51,77
DENITRIFYING. THEY ARE GOING IN TWO OPPOSITE


331
0:20:51,77 --> 0:20:54,46
DIRECTIONS. DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION? OKAY.
ANYBODY


332
0:20:54,46 --> 0:21:3,72
ELSE, YEAH? OH, OKAY. I WILL GO OVER THAT
IN


333
0:21:3,72 --> 0:21:10,64
A SECOND. MYCORRHIZAE. YES? PLANTS USE AMMONIUM


334
0:21:10,64 --> 0:21:12,99
AND NITRATE BUT THEY USE NITRATE MUCH MORE


335
0:21:12,99 --> 0:21:18,82
EFFICIENTLY. SO, IN FACT, FOR MAXIMUM PLANT
GROWTH,


336
0:21:18,82 --> 0:21:23,94
THE AMMONIUM HAS TO GO TO NITRATE, NITRITE
AND


337
0:21:23,94 --> 0:21:29,1
NITRATE. IT TAKES IT UP MUCH, MUCH MORE EASILY.
I


338
0:21:29,1 --> 0:21:31,87
HAVEN'T GONE OVER THAT YET. OKAY? I AM GOING
OVER


339
0:21:31,87 --> 0:21:36,69
THE CYCLES FIRST. OKAY. ANYTHING ELSE?


340
0:21:36,69 --> 0:21:45,14
EVERYBODY GET THIS? YEAH? THE QUESTION IS,


341
0:21:45,14 --> 0:21:48,57
WHERE DOES THE NITRIFICATION OCCUR? IT OCCURS


342
0:21:48,57 --> 0:21:52,93
PRIMARILY THROUGH THE SOIL. THROUGH BACTERIA
THAT ARE


343
0:21:52,93 --> 0:21:56,2
 IN THE SOIL. THROUGH BACTERIA THAT ARE ON
THE PLANTS.


344
0:21:56,2 --> 0:21:58,91
IT IS PART OF THAT SIMPLE BIOTIC BACTERIAL
PROCESS.


345
0:21:58,91 --> 0:22:3,51
IT IS PART, IT COULD BE CONSIDERED PART OF
THE


346
0:22:3,51 --> 0:22:5,84
FIXATION PROCESS, YEAH. WHERE YOU ARE TAKING


347
0:22:5,84 --> 0:22:8,62
ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN AND YOU ARE FIXING IT
ALL OF THE


348
0:22:8,62 --> 0:22:11,77
WAY TO NITRATE A FORM THAT CAN BE USED. OKAY.
VERY


349
0:22:11,77 --> 0:22:16,39
GOOD. NITRIFICATION. ANYTHING ELSE? ALL RIGHT.


350
0:22:16,39 --> 0:22:20,83
THERE IS TWO OTHER TERMS THAT I MENTIONED.
WHEN WE


351
0:22:20,83 --> 0:22:23,37
THINK ABOUT THAT EXPERIMENT THAT WAS DONE,
THAT


352
0:22:23,37 --> 0:22:25,45
EXPERIMENT THAT WAS DONE WHERE THEY SPLIT
THE LAKE IN


353
0:22:25,45 --> 0:22:27,99
HALF AND THEY ADDED PHOSPHORUS TO THE OTHER
HALF AND


354
0:22:27,99 --> 0:22:31,66
THEY HAD THIS TREMENDOUS ALGAL BLOOM. IF YOU
REMEMBER


355
0:22:31,66 --> 0:22:35,54
PLANTS NOT ONLY PHOTOSYNTHESIZE, PRODUCE OXYGEN
AND


356
0:22:35,54 --> 0:22:41,62
GROW, BUT THEY CONSUME OXYGEN. IN THE EXAMPLE
WHERE


357
0:22:41,62 --> 0:22:44,95
WE SHOWED YOU OF THAT LAKE THAT WAS SPLIT
IN HALF,


358
0:22:44,95 --> 0:22:50,46
DURING THE DAY THOSE PLANTS WOULD BE PRODUCING
OXYGEN.


359
0:22:50,46 --> 0:22:54,51
BUT, AT NIGHT THEY WOULD BE USING IT UP. AND,
WHAT WE


360
0:22:54,51 --> 0:22:58,22
HAVE IS A TERM THAT IS CALLED, EUTROPHICATION
AND IT


361
0:22:58,22 --> 0:23:2,34
 ACTUALLY CAN APPLY TO EITHER NITROGEN OR
PHOSPHORUS.


362
0:23:2,34 --> 0:23:5,83
BUT, WHAT THIS TERM MEANS IS THAT THERE IS
SO MANY


363
0:23:5,83 --> 0:23:11,41
NUTRIENTS THAT YOU END UP HAVING OFTEN TIMES


364
0:23:11,41 --> 0:23:15,2
TREMENDOUS REDUCTIONS IN OXYGEN IN THE EVENING
WHEN


365
0:23:15,2 --> 0:23:18,78
RESPIRATION IS GOING ON BUT NO PRODUCTION
OF


366
0:23:18,78 --> 0:23:21,89
PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS GOING ON. AND WHEN WE TALK
ON


367
0:23:21,89 --> 0:23:24,35
MONDAY, I WILL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A LITTLE
MORE ABOUT


368
0:23:24,35 --> 0:23:27,92
EUTROPHICATION. I WANTED TO MENTION IT NOW
BECAUSE IT


369
0:23:27,92 --> 0:23:33,98
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN THE CREATION OF
PROBLEMS IN


370
0:23:33,98 --> 0:23:37,36
LAKES. AND NEXT WEEK'S LAB IS ENTIRELY ON
WATER


371
0:23:37,36 --> 0:23:39,52
POLLUTION. OKAY. NOW THERE ARE A COUPLE OF
THINGS


372
0:23:39,52 --> 0:23:43,8
THAT I ALSO WANTED TO GO BACK TOO. WHEN WE
TALK ABOUT


373
0:23:43,8 --> 0:23:47,67
THE WATER CYCLE, WE TALK ABOUT THE WATER CYCLE
WE HAVE


374
0:23:47,67 --> 0:23:50,45
POLLUTION PROBLEMS. AND NEXT WEEK'S LAB IS
COMPLETELY


375
0:23:50,45 --> 0:23:56,42
DEVOTED TO POLLUTION. SO I WILL TAKE THIS
OFF AND


376
0:23:56,42 --> 0:23:59,83
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WATER IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT
TO


377
0:23:59,83 --> 0:24:8,26
REMEMBER THAT WATER AND THE WATER CYCLE IS
INVOLVED


378
0:24:8,26 --> 0:24:12,84
WITH SOMETHING THAT ARE CALLED AQUAFERS. NOW
WHAT


379
0:24:12,84 --> 0:24:16,23
 AQUAFERS ARE, WHEN YOU GET WATER FROM GROUND
WATER


380
0:24:16,23 --> 0:24:18,66
FROM BENEATH THE SURFACE, PEOPLE TEND TO THINK
THAT


381
0:24:18,66 --> 0:24:22,31
THERE IS LIKE A GIANT RESERVOIR OF WATER.
LIKE A BIG,


382
0:24:22,31 --> 0:24:25,35
JUST A, YOU KNOW, LIKE A BIG SWIMMING POOL.
AND IN


383
0:24:25,35 --> 0:24:27,4
FACT, THE WATER IS NOT LIKE THAT. THE WATER
IS HELD


384
0:24:27,4 --> 0:24:31,49
IN WHAT IS CALLED AQUAFERS. AND, WHAT AQUAFERS
ARE,


385
0:24:31,49 --> 0:24:35,5
ARE PERMEABLE. BUT THEY ARE COMPLETELY SATURATED
WITH


386
0:24:35,5 --> 0:24:38,92
WATER. UNDERGROUND LAYERS OF WATER, ROCK,
SAND AND


387
0:24:38,92 --> 0:24:42,5
GRAVEL. SO THE WATER ISN'T LIKE IN A BIG SWIMMING


388
0:24:42,5 --> 0:24:46,36
POOL, IT IS SIMPLY TIED UP WITH THE SOIL THAT
OCCURS


389
0:24:46,36 --> 0:24:49,2
THERE. THE SOIL AND THE GRAVEL AND THE SAND
THAT IS


390
0:24:49,2 --> 0:24:53,9
IN THE AQUAFERS. AQUAFERS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE
50


391
0:24:53,9 --> 0:24:56,51
PERCENT OF THE DRINKING WATER IN THE US COMING
FROM


392
0:24:56,51 --> 0:24:58,57
THESE SOURCES. IT DOESN'T COME FROM RIVERS.
IT


393
0:24:58,57 --> 0:25:3,76
DOESN'T COME FROM LAKES. IT COMES FROM AQUAFERS.


394
0:25:3,76 --> 0:25:7,1
AND, IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT 2 TO
3 PERCENT


395
0:25:7,1 --> 0:25:10,15
OF THE AQUAFERS ARE POLLUTED TO THE POINT
THAT THEY


396
0:25:10,15 --> 0:25:12,549
CAN'T BE USED ANY MORE. SO THIS IS A REAL
POTENTIAL


397
0:25:12,549 --> 0:25:17,58
 PROBLEM WITH AQUAFERS, IS THAT THE GROUND
WATER IS


398
0:25:17,58 --> 0:25:21,23
GETTING POLLUTED. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR EXAMPLE
IN


399
0:25:21,23 --> 0:25:24,22
SILICON VALLEY. WHERE, BECAUSE OF THE MICROCHIP


400
0:25:24,22 --> 0:25:26,39
INDUSTRY THERE IS A LOT OF POLLUTION WITH
THE GROUND


401
0:25:26,39 --> 0:25:29,14
WATER. BUT IN SILICON VALLEY WE DON'T USE
GROUND


402
0:25:29,14 --> 0:25:32,32
WATER FOR DRINKING WATER. THAT, OF COURSE,
COMES FROM


403
0:25:32,32 --> 0:25:35,75
OTHER SOURCES IN THE SIERRAS. NOW, I WANT
TO TALK


404
0:25:35,75 --> 0:25:39,19
ABOUT POINT VERSUS NON-POINT POLLUTION. BECAUSE
AS I


405
0:25:39,19 --> 0:25:43,13
SAY NEXT WEEK'S LAB IS ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO
POLLUTION.


406
0:25:43,13 --> 0:25:47,57
IF YOU HAVE A FACTORY AND THE FACTORY HAS
A PIPE THAT


407
0:25:47,57 --> 0:25:51,66
IS CARRYING CHEMICALS INTO A RIVER AND YOU
CAN


408
0:25:51,66 --> 0:25:55,85
IDENTIFY THE EXACT POINT OR THE SOURCE OF
THAT


409
0:25:55,85 --> 0:25:59,13
POLLUTANT WHERE IT IS FLOWING IN, SAY THE
WATER IS


410
0:25:59,13 --> 0:26:2,79
FLOWING THIS WAY, SO THAT ABOVE THE WATER
IS CLEAN,


411
0:26:2,79 --> 0:26:6,6
BELOW IT IS POLLUTED, YOU WOULD REFER TO THAT
AS A


412
0:26:6,6 --> 0:26:9,6
POINT SOURCE OF POLLUTION. IN OTHER WORDS,
IT IS


413
0:26:9,6 --> 0:26:13,41
IDENTIFIED EXACTLY WHERE THAT POLLUTION IS


414
0:26:13,41 --> 0:26:17,429
CONSIDERING. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU HAD
SAY THIS


415
0:26:17,429 --> 0:26:19,44
 SUDDENLY WAS TAKING CARE OF IT. IN THE UNITED
STATES


416
0:26:19,44 --> 0:26:21,95
MOST OF THE POINT SOURCES OF POLLUTION HAVE
BEEN


417
0:26:21,95 --> 0:26:25,8
ELIMINATED. SO THAT IS NOT REALLY A PROBLEM,
BUT, YOU


418
0:26:25,8 --> 0:26:29,21
HAVE GOT SAY A PARKING LOT UP HERE AND THE
RUNOFF FROM


419
0:26:29,21 --> 0:26:32,75
THAT PARKING LOT IS BRINGING OIL AND GREASE
INTO THE


420
0:26:32,75 --> 0:26:36,26
STREAM. AND MAYBE YOU HAVE GOT AN AGRICULTURAL
FIELD


421
0:26:36,26 --> 0:26:41,86
HERE AND THAT IS BRINGING SILT FROM EROSION
INTO THE


422
0:26:41,86 --> 0:26:46,1
STREAM. WE WOULD CALL THAT NON-POINT SOURCE.
AND ALL


423
0:26:46,1 --> 0:26:50,31
THE DIFFERENCE REALLY IS, IS WHETHER WE CAN
IDENTIFY


424
0:26:50,31 --> 0:26:53,0
EXACTLY WHERE THAT POLLUTION IS COMING IN
OR IF IT IS


425
0:26:53,0 --> 0:26:55,99
COMING IN FROM A VARIETY OF DISPERSED SOURCES.
OKAY.


426
0:26:55,99 --> 0:26:59,6
JUST COMMON SENSE. THINK OF WHAT THE WORDS
MEAN. AS


427
0:26:59,6 --> 0:27:2,62
I SAID IN NORTH AMERICA, IN MOST DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES


428
0:27:2,62 --> 0:27:6,1
OF THE WORLD, POINT SOURCE POLLUTION IS NOT
A PROBLEM.


429
0:27:6,1 --> 0:27:9,12
BUT, NON-POINT SOURCE POLLUTION IS A REALLY
BIG,


430
0:27:9,12 --> 0:27:14,78
A REALLY BIG PROBLEM. OKAY? ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT


431
0:27:14,78 --> 0:27:16,96
POINT VERSUS NON-POINT? I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU


432
0:27:16,96 --> 0:27:20,18
GET THAT DISTINCTION. OKAY. PRETTY OBVIOUS.
THINK


433
0:27:20,18 --> 0:27:25,42
 OF THE MEANINGS OF THE WORDS. GETTING BACK
TO OUR


434
0:27:25,42 --> 0:27:26,83
PHOSPHORUS CYCLE. BECAUSE THIS IS VERY, VERY


435
0:27:26,83 --> 0:27:34,68
IMPORTANT IN AGRICULTURE IS THAT WE HAVE FUNGI
THAT


436
0:27:34,68 --> 0:27:37,15
ARE CALLED MYCORRHIZAE. M-Y-C-O-R-R-H-I-Z-A-E.
JUST


437
0:27:37,15 --> 0:27:41,29
LIKE WE HAVE SYMBIOTIC BACTERIA THAT HELP
BRING


438
0:27:41,29 --> 0:27:45,13
NITROGEN INTO FORMS THAT ARE USEABLE BY PLANTS,
WE


439
0:27:45,13 --> 0:27:49,1
HAVE MYCORRHIZAE THAT ARE SYMBIOTIC ASSOCIATIONS
OF


440
0:27:49,1 --> 0:27:53,1
PLANTS AND FUNGI. AND THEY ARE CRITICAL IN
THE


441
0:27:53,1 --> 0:27:57,8
ABSORPTION OF [INAUDIBLE]. NOW, AGRICULTURE
IN OUR


442
0:27:57,8 --> 0:27:59,88
FOOD REALLY IS REALLY, REALLY DEPENDENT ON
THESE


443
0:27:59,88 --> 0:28:3,79
PROCESSES. BOTH OF THE LEGUMES, THE PEAS AND
THE


444
0:28:3,79 --> 0:28:6,68
BEANS AND THE CORN AND EVERYTHING WE EAT DEPENDS
ON


445
0:28:6,68 --> 0:28:11,15
THESE BACTERIA CONVERTING NITROGEN INTO A
FORM. AND A


446
0:28:11,15 --> 0:28:16,72
LOT OF TREE GROWTH DEPENDS ON PHOSPHORUS.
ENABLING


447
0:28:16,72 --> 0:28:19,42
PHOSPHORUS TO BE IN A FORM THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED
WITH


448
0:28:19,42 --> 0:28:22,48
PLANTS. AND THEN WE CAN GO BACK TO WATER.
YOU KNOW,


449
0:28:22,48 --> 0:28:27,97
ROUGHLY, IT TAKES ABOUT A THOUSAND KILOGRAMS
OF WATER


450
0:28:27,97 --> 0:28:35,67
TO RAISE OR PRODUCE ONE KILOGRAM OF AGRICULTURAL
 PLANTS. ABOUT A THOUSAND TO ONE RATIO. BUT


451
0:28:35,67 --> 0:28:35,73
OF


452
0:28:35,73 --> 0:28:38,6
COURSE, SIMPLY LOOK AT THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW,
RICE


453
0:28:38,6 --> 0:28:42,52
COMPARED TO POTATOES. RICE TAKES ABOUT YOU
KNOW, TEN


454
0:28:42,52 --> 0:28:45,51
TIMES AS MUCH AS POTATOES DO. BECAUSE, OF
THE WAY


455
0:28:45,51 --> 0:28:48,36
THAT IT IS GROWN. SO, THERE IS A LOT OF VARIATION.


456
0:28:48,36 --> 0:28:52,58
BUT AS A RULE OF THUMB, WE SEE ABOUT A THOUSAND
TO ONE


457
0:28:52,58 --> 0:28:57,23
KILOGRAMS OF WATER TO PRODUCE ONE POUND OF
PLANT. IN


458
0:28:57,23 --> 0:29:0,17
CALIFORNIA, WHERE AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE WATER
SHORTAGES


459
0:29:0,17 --> 0:29:4,25
MANY YEARS. ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE WATER
GOES FOR


460
0:29:4,25 --> 0:29:10,87
AGRICULTURAL USE. AGRICULTURAL USE. A LITTLE
FOR


461
0:29:10,87 --> 0:29:12,85
INDUSTRIAL, BUT ONLY ABOUT 10 PERCENT TENDS
TO BE USED


462
0:29:12,85 --> 0:29:16,5
DOMESTICALLY, MOST OF IT IS GOING IN TO AGRICULTURAL


463
0:29:16,5 --> 0:29:21,69
PRODUCTION. YEAH? PLANT IN GENERAL. BECAUSE


464
0:29:21,69 --> 0:29:23,39
REMEMBER, WHEN WE ARE GROWING AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTS WE


465
0:29:23,39 --> 0:29:27,43
ARE TENDING TO GROW AS MUCH EDIBLE PART AT
POSSIBLE.


466
0:29:27,43 --> 0:29:31,41
YEAH. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE POUND OF THE
PLANT.


467
0:29:31,41 --> 0:29:35,38
THE MAXIMUM PART OF THAT WE TRY TO HAVE AS
EDIBLE.


468
0:29:35,38 --> 0:29:38,62
OKAY, NOW, EVERYBODY PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE
THIS IS


469
0:29:38,62 --> 0:29:48,13
 REALLY IMPORTANT. OKAY? I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
AN


470
0:29:48,13 --> 0:29:55,61
EXPERIMENT. NOW, HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT
TO ADD


471
0:29:55,61 --> 0:30:1,41
FERTILIZER TO YOUR LAWN OR YOU WANT TO REGULATE
THE


472
0:30:1,41 --> 0:30:4,4
AMOUNT OF PHOSPHORUS OR NITROGEN THAT IS GOING
INTO


473
0:30:4,4 --> 0:30:11,36
THE ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS WE SAW WITH THAT
WHOLE LAKE


474
0:30:11,36 --> 0:30:15,85
MANIPULATION. AND WE WANT TO ASK WHETHER N
OR P IS


475
0:30:15,85 --> 0:30:24,36
THE LIMITING FACTOR. WHETHER N OR P IS THE
LIMITING


476
0:30:24,36 --> 0:30:28,28
FACTOR, WE CAN DO AN EXPERIMENT. AND, WHAT
WE ARE


477
0:30:28,28 --> 0:30:31,38
GOING TO DO IS SINCE WE HAVE USED NITROGEN
PHOSPHORUS


478
0:30:31,38 --> 0:30:35,12
IN THE LAKE EXAMPLE, WE ARE GOING TO USE AN
AQUATIC


479
0:30:35,12 --> 0:30:39,63
EXAMPLE AS WELL. SO, WE WANT TO SEE IF IN
AN AQUATIC


480
0:30:39,63 --> 0:30:42,52
ENVIRONMENT, LET'S JUST SAY, IT IS A STREAM
THAT IS


481
0:30:42,52 --> 0:30:48,3
FLOWING, WHICH ONE OF THESE TWO IS LIMITING?
WE CAN


482
0:30:48,3 --> 0:30:52,27
DO A VERY, VERY SIMPLE EXPERIMENT. WE CAN
TAKE FLOWER


483
0:30:52,27 --> 0:31:1,9
POTS, CLAY FLOWER POTS. AND WE CAN PUT 3 FLOWER
POTS,


484
0:31:1,9 --> 0:31:3,61
LET ME MAKE THAT THE SIDES A LITTLE SO THEY
WILL LOOK


485
0:31:3,61 --> 0:31:14,35
A LITTLE MORE LIKE FLOWER POTS, AND WE CAN
PUT THEM


486
0:31:14,35 --> 0:31:19,72
UNDER WATER. NOW, WE FILL THE FLOWER POTS
UP WITH SAY


487
0:31:19,72 --> 0:31:26,9
 AGAR AND OTHER KINDS OF MATERIAL THAT IS
GOING TO HOLD


488
0:31:26,9 --> 0:31:33,34
NUTRIENTS IN. AND, IN ONE FLOWER POT TO THE
AGAR, WE


489
0:31:33,34 --> 0:31:39,28
ADD NITROGEN. TO THE OTHER FLOWER POT WE ADD


490
0:31:39,28 --> 0:31:43,28
PHOSPHORUS. AND THEN WE LEAVE THEM UNDER WATER.
WHAT


491
0:31:43,28 --> 0:31:48,6
IS GOING TO HAPPEN, AND LISTEN TO THIS VERY
CAREFULLY,


492
0:31:48,6 --> 0:31:51,79
AND WE SEAL THE TOPS, LET'S ADD THAT, WE SEAL
THE


493
0:31:51,79 --> 0:31:57,0
TOPS. NONE OF THE MATERIAL CAN LEECH OUT OF
THE


494
0:31:57,0 --> 0:32:0,52
FLOWER POT THROUGH THE TOP. THE ONLY WAY IT
CAN LEECH


495
0:32:0,52 --> 0:32:8,4
OUT IS HERE THROUGH THE SIDES OF THE FLOWER
POT


496
0:32:8,4 --> 0:32:15,8
ITSELF. NOW, USING THIS EXPERIMENT, USING
THIS


497
0:32:15,8 --> 0:32:21,74
DESIGN, HOW COULD BE TELL WHETHER NITROGEN
OR


498
0:32:21,74 --> 0:32:24,5
PHOSPHORUS WAS THE LIMITING FACTOR? LET ME
SAY IT


499
0:32:24,5 --> 0:32:27,86
ONE MORE TIME. WE HAVE A FLOWER POT WITH NITROGEN


500
0:32:27,86 --> 0:32:32,41
COMING OUT, ONLY NITROGEN. A FLOWER POT WITH
ONLY


501
0:32:32,41 --> 0:32:36,79
PHOSPHORUS COMING OUT. HOW WOULD WE DECIDE
WHETHER N


502
0:32:36,79 --> 0:32:39,64
OR P WAS THE LIMITING FACTOR? WHAT WOULD BE
OUR


503
0:32:39,64 --> 0:32:42,76
INDICATION AT THE END OF SAY A MONTH OF LEAVING
THIS


504
0:32:42,76 --> 0:32:46,77
IN THE WATER THAT ONE OF THESE WOULD BE A
LIMITING


505
0:32:46,77 --> 0:32:49,63
 FACTOR? TAKE 30 SECONDS TO TALK ABOUT THIS
BECAUSE


506
0:32:49,63 --> 0:32:53,74
THIS IS THE TYPE QUESTION I AM GOING TO BE
ASKING YOU.


507
0:32:53,74 --> 0:32:56,91
OKAY? 30 SECONDS. THINK OF THIS EXPERIMENT.


508
0:32:56,91 --> 0:33:0,6
NITROGEN, NITROGEN IS LEECHING OUT OF ONE
POT.


509
0:33:0,6 --> 0:33:3,63
PHOSPHORUS IS LEECHING OUT OF ANOTHER POT.
HOW WOULD


510
0:33:3,63 --> 0:33:7,36
YOU TELL WHICH ONE IS LIMITING? REMEMBER,
YOU HAVE


511
0:33:7,36 --> 0:33:10,7
GOT A STREAM OF ALGAE GROWING IN IT. THERE
IS ALWAYS


512
0:33:10,7 --> 0:33:32,75
ALGAE IN STREAMS. DIATOMS. ALL UNDER WATER.


513
0:33:32,75 --> 0:33:32,75
OKAY.


514
0:33:32,75 --> 0:33:35,98
WHO HAS GOT AN IDEA? IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
THE RIGHT


515
0:33:35,98 --> 0:33:38,9
IDEA, WHO JUST HAS AN IDEA THAT WE CAN START
TALKING


516
0:33:38,9 --> 0:33:40,28
ABOUT IT? YOU TWO HAVE BEEN TALKING A LOT
YOU MUST


517
0:33:40,28 --> 0:33:51,87
HAVE A SUGGESTION? 
OKAY. WHAT HE JUST SAID IT,


518
0:33:51,87 --> 0:33:55,33
WHICHEVER ONE HAS THE LOWER CONCENTRATION.
THAT WOULD


519
0:33:55,33 --> 0:33:59,0
JUST REFLECT THE LEECHING RATE OF COMING OUT.


520
0:33:59,0 --> 0:34:1,38
WOULDN'T REALLY TELL YOU WHICH ONE WAS THE
LIMITING


521
0:34:1,38 --> 0:34:4,49
FACTOR. WHAT WOULD TELL YOU WHAT THE LIMITING
FACTOR


522
0:34:4,49 --> 0:34:12,32
WAS? HOW ABOUT YOU? WHAT DO YOU THINK? YEAH?


523
0:34:12,32 --> 0:34:23,58
BUT, YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. WHICH ONE
IS, ARE


524
0:34:23,58 --> 0:34:32,21
 PLANTS USING? WHICH ONE. THAT IS GETTING
CLOSE.


525
0:34:32,21 --> 0:34:38,97
SAY THIS REAL LOUD.


526
0:34:38,97 --> 0:34:41,47
STUDENT: SO YOU LOOK AT THE ONE THAT DOESN'T


527
0:34:41,47 --> 0:34:43,52
ANYTHING LEECHING OUT OF IT. BECAUSE THAT
IS LIKE


528
0:34:43,52 --> 0:34:46,8
YOUR CONTROL. YOU SEE WHAT IS GROWING ON THAT
AND


529
0:34:46,8 --> 0:34:48,649
YOU SEE THE ONE THAT'S ARE LEECHING MINERALS
OUT


530
0:34:48,649 --> 0:34:52,11
AND YOU SEE WHICH ONE HAS MORE STUFF GROWING
ON IT.


531
0:34:52,11 --> 0:34:53,62
PROFESSOR: WHAT KIND OF STUFF?


532
0:34:53,62 --> 0:34:54,29
STUDENT: LIKE ALGAE.


533
0:34:54,29 --> 0:34:56,29
PROFESSOR: GREAT. GREAT. THAT IS EXACTLY


534
0:34:56,29 --> 0:34:58,75
RIGHT. NOW LET THE THINK ABOUT THIS EXPERIMENT.


535
0:34:58,75 --> 0:35:2,69
YOU HAVE PHOSPHORUS LEECHING OUT AND YOU HAVE


536
0:35:2,69 --> 0:35:5,29
NITROGEN LEECHING OUT. YOU LOOK AND SEE WHICH
ONE


537
0:35:5,29 --> 0:35:8,35
GIVES YOU THE BIGGEST PLANT RESPONSE, IN OTHER


538
0:35:8,35 --> 0:35:10,49
WORDS, AS I SAID ALGAE IS ALWAYS GROWING IN
THIS


539
0:35:10,49 --> 0:35:15,52
SYSTEM. AND YOU LOOK AND SEE WHICH HAS THE
LARGEST


540
0:35:15,52 --> 0:35:18,74
AMOUNT OF ALGAL GROWTH. LARGEST AMOUNT OF
ALGAL


541
0:35:18,74 --> 0:35:20,52
GROWTH AND THAT WOULD BE THE ONE THAT WAS
THE


542
0:35:20,52 --> 0:35:26,25
 LIMITING FACTOR. OKAY. NOW, SHE GAVE YOU
A HINT


543
0:35:26,25 --> 0:35:30,56
BUT WHAT IS THIS? WHAT WOULD WE CALL THIS
POT


544
0:35:30,56 --> 0:35:35,14
THAT HAS AGAR IN IT BUT NEITHER NITROGEN OR


545
0:35:35,14 --> 0:35:38,1
PHOSPHORUS? CONTROL. WHAT KIND OF CONTROL
WOULD


546
0:35:38,1 --> 0:35:42,67
WE TALK ABOUT IT? NOT REALLY, A PROCEDURE
WISE


547
0:35:42,67 --> 0:35:44,4
CONTROL. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THESE BEFORE.


548
0:35:44,4 --> 0:35:46,93
A PROCEDURE WISE CONTROL. IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU


549
0:35:46,93 --> 0:35:53,95
WOULD WANT TO FIND IF THE POT BY ITSELF PRODUCED


550
0:35:53,95 --> 0:35:56,36
ALGAE. OKAY? SO IT IS A PROCEDURE WISE CONTROL


551
0:35:56,36 --> 0:35:58,73
TO SEE IF YOUR EXPERIMENT MAKES SENSE OR YOU
HAVE


552
0:35:58,73 --> 0:36:3,77
GOT SOMETHING THAT IS DOING THIS. NOW, LET'S
SAY,


553
0:36:3,77 --> 0:36:7,5
YOU HAVE GOT POTS FROM MEXICO. POTS MADE IN
MEXICO


554
0:36:7,5 --> 0:36:11,2
TEND TO HAVE VERY, VERY HIGH IRON CONTENT
IN THEM.


555
0:36:11,2 --> 0:36:14,1
AND, YOU DON'T KNOW IT WHEN YOU DO THIS, BUT
IRON


556
0:36:14,1 --> 0:36:18,54
WILL BIND TO PHOSPHORUS. SO, THAT IN FACT,
THE


557
0:36:18,54 --> 0:36:20,83
PHOSPHORUS, WHEN IT STARTS TO LEECH OUT OF
THE POT


558
0:36:20,83 --> 0:36:23,73
WILL BIND TO THE POT AND WON'T BE RELEASED.
WHAT


559
0:36:23,73 --> 0:36:31,75
WOULD YOU CALL THAT? WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THAT?
 AY YI YI. WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THAT? AN


560
0:36:31,75 --> 0:36:35,3
UNCONTROLLED VARIABLE. OKAY. YOU ARE ASSUMING


561
0:36:35,3 --> 0:36:39,64
THAT THIS EVERYTHING IS OCCURRING THE SAME
IN THIS


562
0:36:39,64 --> 0:36:42,22
BUT IF THE IRON IS GOING TO LEECH TO THE


563
0:36:42,22 --> 0:36:44,8
PHOSPHORUS, THEN THE PHOSPHORUS IS NOT GOING
TO BE


564
0:36:44,8 --> 0:36:46,96
RELEASED. IT IS AN UNCONTROLLED VARIABLE.


565
0:36:46,96 --> 0:36:49,52
FINALLY, WHAT KIND OF, OF ALL OF THE EXPERIMENTS
WE


566
0:36:49,52 --> 0:36:52,26
DESCRIBED, WHAT TYPE OF EXPERIMENT WOULD YOU
CALL


567
0:36:52,26 --> 0:36:59,49
THIS? IS IT AN EXCLUSION EXPERIMENT? IS IT
AN


568
0:36:59,49 --> 0:37:6,5
EXPERIMENT? IS IT A CAGE EXPERIMENT?


569
0:37:6,5 --> 0:37:9,31
SUPPLEMENTATION EXPERIMENT. WHAT WOULD YOU
CALL


570
0:37:9,31 --> 0:37:13,83
IT? WHAT IS IT MOST LIKE? PROBABLY LIKE


571
0:37:13,83 --> 0:37:17,8
A SUPPLEMENTATION EXPERIMENT. BECAUSE YOU
ARE


572
0:37:17,8 --> 0:37:20,88
ADDING COMPOUNDS TO SEE IF YOU ARE RELEASING


573
0:37:20,88 --> 0:37:25,5
COMPETITION OR YOU ARE GETTING A RESPONSE.
VERY


574
0:37:25,5 --> 0:37:41,91
GOOD. OKAY. NOW, YOU HAD A QUESTION? 


575
0:37:41,91 --> 0:37:42,96
OKAY.


576
0:37:42,96 --> 0:37:45,35
GOOD, I AM GLAD. WHAT SHE JUST SAID. THERE
IS


577
0:37:45,35 --> 0:37:50,9
UNCONTROLLED VARIABLE. WHAT IF YOU PUT THE
 NITROGEN IN AN AREA WHERE MORE WATER WAS


578
0:37:50,9 --> 0:37:50,51
FLOWING BY


579
0:37:50,51 --> 0:37:52,9
AND IT GOT IT TO LEECH OUT FASTER THAN THE


580
0:37:52,9 --> 0:37:55,8
PHOSPHORUS. GREAT. GOOD WAY TO THINK OF IT.
YOU


581
0:37:55,8 --> 0:37:58,6
ARE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT UNCONTROLLED


582
0:37:58,6 --> 0:38:0,36
VARIABLES. THAT IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF
ONE.


583
0:38:0,36 --> 0:38:4,3
OR, WHEN THE NITROGEN MAYBE WAS IN THE SHADE.
AND


584
0:38:4,3 --> 0:38:13,24
THE PHOSPHORUS WAS IN FULL SUN. OKAY? 
OKAY. SAY


585
0:38:13,24 --> 0:38:13,79
THAT AGAIN?


586
0:38:13,79 --> 0:38:16,49
STUDENT: WHEN YOU ARE CONDUCTION THE EXPERIMENT


587
0:38:16,49 --> 0:38:18,4
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHICH, HOW MUCH TO PUT IN?


588
0:38:18,4 --> 0:38:20,39
PROFESSOR: HOW DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD KNOW
HOW


589
0:38:20,39 --> 0:38:23,2
MUCH TO PUT IN? WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO DECIDE
HOW


590
0:38:23,2 --> 0:38:25,6
MUCH YOU WANT TO PUT IN? YOU WOULD CONDUCT
WHAT?


591
0:38:25,6 --> 0:38:31,8
WHAT WOULD YOU CONDUCT FIRST? A PILOT STUDY.


592
0:38:31,8 --> 0:38:33,97
OKAY. THAT WAY YOU WOULD SEE IF YOU GOT ANY


593
0:38:33,97 --> 0:38:37,0
RESPONSE AT ALL. YOU WOULD JUST CONDUCT A
PILOT


594
0:38:37,0 --> 0:38:39,8
STUDY. OKAY. GOOD. VERY GOOD QUESTIONS. ALL


595
0:38:39,8 --> 0:38:43,42
RIGHT. ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS? OKAY. WE
ARE


596
0:38:43,42 --> 0:38:45,32
 GOING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE NOW THAT TIES
IN TO


597
0:38:45,32 --> 0:38:53,46
EARLIER LECTURES. WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT
HOW


598
0:38:53,46 --> 0:38:58,21
SUCCESSION AND ECOSYSTEMS RELATE TO EACH OTHER.


599
0:38:58,21 --> 0:38:59,75
NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THIS FIRST THING I HAVE
WRITTEN


600
0:38:59,75 --> 0:39:4,91
ON THE BOARD. AS ECOSYSTEMS MATURE, AS ECOSYSTEMS


601
0:39:4,91 --> 0:39:10,43
GET OLDER, THERE IS AN INCREASE IN TOTAL BIOMASS


602
0:39:10,43 --> 0:39:15,16
BUT A DECREASE IN NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY.
THERE


603
0:39:15,16 --> 0:39:18,66
IS AN INCREASE IN BIOMASS BUT A DECREASE IN
NET


604
0:39:18,66 --> 0:39:20,9
PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY. THINK OF WHEN YOU WENT
TO


605
0:39:20,9 --> 0:39:24,62
THE REDWOOD GROVE THIS WEEK. THOSE REDWOOD
TREES


606
0:39:24,62 --> 0:39:28,53
HAVE HUGE AMOUNTS OF BIOMASS. BUT, VERY, VERY
LOW


607
0:39:28,53 --> 0:39:30,97
RATES OF PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY. THEY ARE NOT,
THE


608
0:39:30,97 --> 0:39:34,34
RATE THE ACCUMULATION OF BIOMASS IS VERY SLOW


609
0:39:34,34 --> 0:39:35,98
RELATIVE TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF BIOMASS THERE.


610
0:39:35,98 --> 0:39:38,94
BECAUSE, THEY ARE NOT GROWING VERY FAST ANY
MORE.


611
0:39:38,94 --> 0:39:42,14
MOST OF THE GROWTH IS ALREADY IN NON-LIVING,
IN


612
0:39:42,14 --> 0:39:46,3
LIVING BIOPASS BUT IN NON-PHOTOSYNTHETIC BIOMASS,


613
0:39:46,3 --> 0:39:50,13
THE REDWOOD TRUNK ITSELF. NOW, LET'S LOOK
AT THE


614
0:39:50,13 --> 0:39:53,16
 SECOND ONE. EARLY SUCCESSIONAL STAGES WHERE
YOU


615
0:39:53,16 --> 0:39:56,5
HAVE A LOT OF R SELECTED SPECIES WHERE EMPHASIS
IS


616
0:39:56,5 --> 0:39:59,79
ON GROWTH AND FAST REPRODUCTION AND GETTING
NUMBERS


617
0:39:59,79 --> 0:40:3,13
OUT THERE. EARLY SUCCESSIONAL STAGES ARE MORE


618
0:40:3,13 --> 0:40:7,1
PRODUCTIVE THAN LATER SUCCESSIONAL STAGES.
THESE


619
0:40:7,1 --> 0:40:11,81
ARE RULES OF THUMB THAT WE SEE IN ECOSYSTEMS.
AND


620
0:40:11,81 --> 0:40:16,24
THE THIRD ONE IS DISTURBANCE FUNCTIONS TO
KEEP


621
0:40:16,24 --> 0:40:20,88
ECOSYSTEMS INTO EARLY SUCCESSIONAL STAGES
AND


622
0:40:20,88 --> 0:40:23,9
HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY. SO, WE HAVE ALREADY TALKED


623
0:40:23,9 --> 0:40:26,88
ABOUT CLIMAX COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY NOT BEING
VERY


624
0:40:26,88 --> 0:40:29,6
REALISTIC UNLESS THEY ARE HIGHLY MANAGED SYSTEMS.


625
0:40:29,6 --> 0:40:33,82
BECAUSE, WHAT YOU HAVE IS DISTURBANCES MAKING


626
0:40:33,82 --> 0:40:37,42
THINGS GO BACK TO EARLY SUCCESSIONAL STAGES.
OKAY.


627
0:40:37,42 --> 0:40:41,63
NOW, THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT.
WHAT


628
0:40:41,63 --> 0:40:46,21
DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH HELICOPSYCHE? WITH
THE


629
0:40:46,21 --> 0:40:47,58
EXPERIMENTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HELICOPSYCHE,


630
0:40:47,58 --> 0:40:51,48
BECAUSE THIS IS THE WRAP UP OF THE STORY,
IN THE


631
0:40:51,48 --> 0:40:54,44
EXPERIMENTS WE TALKED ABOUT WITH HELICOPSYCHE
WE


632
0:40:54,44 --> 0:40:58,14
 DID EXCLUSION EXPERIMENTS, WE DID CAGE EXPERIMENTS


633
0:40:58,14 --> 0:41:3,43
AND WE DEMONSTRATED THAT HELICOPSYCHE WAS
IN FACT


634
0:41:3,43 --> 0:41:7,86
WHEN IT WAS EXCLUDED, CAUSED THESE HUGE GROWTHS
OF


635
0:41:7,86 --> 0:41:12,29
ALGAE. BUT WHEN WE DID THE LIGHT BOX/DARK
BOX


636
0:41:12,29 --> 0:41:19,0
EXPERIMENT WHAT WE SHOWED WAS THAT THE EXCLUSION


637
0:41:19,0 --> 0:41:21,89
PRODUCED LESS OXYGEN AND HAD LOWER PRIMARY


638
0:41:21,89 --> 0:41:27,46
PRODUCTIVITY THAN THE GRAZED TILES. THE EXCLUSION


639
0:41:27,46 --> 0:41:30,75
HAD FAR LOWER PRODUCTIVITY THAN THE GRAZED
TILES.


640
0:41:30,75 --> 0:41:36,15
HOW DO THESE 3 PRINCIPLES RELATE TO HELICOPSYCHE?


641
0:41:36,15 --> 0:41:38,69
LET'S TAKE 30 SECONDS AND TALK TO EACH OTHER
ABOUT


642
0:41:38,69 --> 0:42:4,22
THIS. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. TALK WITH EACH


643
0:42:4,22 --> 0:42:14,81
OTHER. 


644
0:42:14,81 --> 0:42:17,45
OKAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. THIS IS AN


645
0:42:17,45 --> 0:42:20,7
EXAMPLE WHERE WE ARE TALKING MATERIAL FROM
ONE


646
0:42:20,7 --> 0:42:23,16
TOPIC AND RELATING IT COMPLETELY TO MATERIAL
WITH


647
0:42:23,16 --> 0:42:25,64
ANOTHER TOPIC. WHAT DO YOU THINK? ANYBODY
HAVE


648
0:42:25,64 --> 0:42:35,97
ANY SUGGESTIONS THEY WANT TO MAKE? EMILY?
OKAY.


649
0:42:35,97 --> 0:42:38,62
GRAZING. WHAT SHE JUST SAID WAS, GRAZING BY


650
0:42:38,62 --> 0:42:43,54
HELICOPSYCHE MOVES THOSE ALGAL COMMUNITIES
BACK TO


651
0:42:43,54 --> 0:42:46,35
 AN EARLY SUCCESSIONAL STAGE. IN FACT, IT
KEEPS


652
0:42:46,35 --> 0:42:48,94
THEM AT AN EARLY SUCCESSIONAL STAGE BECAUSE
IT IS


653
0:42:48,94 --> 0:42:51,98
CONSTANTLY GRAZING. CONSTANTLY GRAZING. OKAY?


654
0:42:51,98 --> 0:43:1,58
WHAT IS ANOTHER THING? 
BECAUSE IT IS AN EARLIER


655
0:43:1,58 --> 0:43:4,61
SUCCESSIONAL STAGE IT IS KEEPING ALL THESE
R


656
0:43:4,61 --> 0:43:9,25
SELECTED SPECIES, IT'S MORE PRODUCTIVE. OKAY?


657
0:43:9,25 --> 0:43:11,72
THE R SELECTED SPECIES, EMPHASIS ON GROWTH.
WHAT


658
0:43:11,72 --> 0:43:15,93
IS FUNNY? AM I MISSING SOMETHING. OH. KEEPING


659
0:43:15,93 --> 0:43:20,89
THESE AT R SELECTED SPECIES WHICH ARE HIGHLY


660
0:43:20,89 --> 0:43:23,24
PRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THEIR EMPHASIS IS ON GROWTH.


661
0:43:23,24 --> 0:43:32,72
WHAT ELSE? 
ALGAE HAVE HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY IN


662
0:43:32,72 --> 0:43:37,2
THESE EARLY GROWTH STAGES. WHEN THEY GET TO
THAT


663
0:43:37,2 --> 0:43:41,8
EXCLUSION TILE, WHICH REMEMBER LOOKED LIKE
THIS,


664
0:43:41,8 --> 0:43:47,91
REMEMBER, HERE IS THE GRAZED TILES. YOU COULDN'T


665
0:43:47,91 --> 0:43:50,6
EVEN SEE ANYTHING GROWING ON THEM. IN THE


666
0:43:50,6 --> 0:43:55,14
EXCLUSION TILES, REMEMBER, IT WAS FORESTS.
IT WAS


667
0:43:55,14 --> 0:43:58,98
VERY, VERY LOW PRODUCTIVITY. AND THE REASON
IS


668
0:43:58,98 --> 0:44:7,87
THIS, IS THAT REMEMBER, EVERYTHING BELOW THAT
 SURFACE IS NOT GETTING ANY SUNLIGHT. IN


669
0:44:7,87 --> 0:44:8,6
A WAY,


670
0:44:8,6 --> 0:44:12,37
THEY ARE LIKE REDWOOD TREES. IT IS MOSTLY
STALKS


671
0:44:12,37 --> 0:44:15,65
AND DEAD CELLS AND NON-GROWING CELLS. SO,
IT IS


672
0:44:15,65 --> 0:44:19,71
HIGH BIOMASS, BUT VERY, VERY LOW RATES OF


673
0:44:19,71 --> 0:44:23,6
PRODUCTIVITY. OKAY? IN OTHER WORDS, IT WAS
MORE


674
0:44:23,6 --> 0:44:27,57
OF A MATURE ECOSYSTEM THAN OCCURS HERE WHERE


675
0:44:27,57 --> 0:44:30,36
EVERYTHING IS UNDER R SELECTION. REMEMBER,
THIS IS


676
0:44:30,36 --> 0:44:34,48
WHERE THE EXCLUSION WORKED LIKE THAT. OKAY.
THIS


677
0:44:34,48 --> 0:44:36,8
IS A VERY, VERY IMPORTANT POINT. AGAIN, THE
MOST


678
0:44:36,8 --> 0:44:39,74
IMPORTANT POINT IS WE ARE INTEGRATING MATERIAL


679
0:44:39,74 --> 0:44:41,76
ACROSS LECTURES. WHICH IS WHY WE TALKED IN
THE


680
0:44:41,76 --> 0:44:45,6
BEGINNING THAT THIS IS CONCEPTUAL MATERIAL.
YOU


681
0:44:45,6 --> 0:44:47,33
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT. YOU CAN'T, YOU CAN'T
JUST


682
0:44:47,33 --> 0:44:49,9
MEMORIZE IT. ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT
THIS


683
0:44:49,9 --> 0:44:51,69
OR ANYTHING YOU WANT ME TO GO OVER? I WANT
TO


684
0:44:51,69 --> 0:44:54,76
MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THIS. PLEASE,
IF YOU


685
0:44:54,76 --> 0:44:57,3
HAVE GOT ANY QUESTIONS DON'T COME UP AFTER
CLASS.


686
0:44:57,3 --> 0:45:20,66
ASK IT NOW. I WOULD RATHER MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND
 THIS. BEHIND ME. THANKS. OKAY. OKAY. IN


687
0:45:20,66 --> 0:45:20,84
THE


688
0:45:20,84 --> 0:45:24,29
EXCLUDED TILES, THE ONES THAT ARE ELEVATED,
IT IS


689
0:45:24,29 --> 0:45:26,47
NOT SO MUCH THAT THE MATERIAL IS DEAD, IT
IS JUST


690
0:45:26,47 --> 0:45:30,44
NON-PRODUCTIVE. IT IS NOT PHOTOSYNTHESIZING.


691
0:45:30,44 --> 0:45:32,62
OKAY. IT IS STILL ALIVE BUT IT IS NOT PRODUCING


692
0:45:32,62 --> 0:45:39,3
OXYGEN. IT IS BASICALLY USING UP OXYGEN. RIGHT.


693
0:45:39,3 --> 0:45:42,54
IT IS LIKE THE REDWOODS. THINK OF THE TRUNK
OF THE


694
0:45:42,54 --> 0:45:44,99
REDWOODS NOT PRODUCING ANYTHING. IT IS THE
LEAVES


695
0:45:44,99 --> 0:45:47,61
THAT ARE ON TOP THAT ARE PRODUCING. SO THAT
SECOND


696
0:45:47,61 --> 0:45:52,57
POINT OF, HIGH BIOMASS. THE FIRST POINT AS
THE


697
0:45:52,57 --> 0:45:56,23
ECOSYSTEMS MATURE THIS RELATES VERY, VERY
MUCH TO


698
0:45:56,23 --> 0:45:59,16
WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS TO THE EXCLUSION, YOU
HAVE


699
0:45:59,16 --> 0:46:3,59
GOT HIGH BIOMASS, BUT LOW NET PRODUCTIVITY.
OKAY.


700
0:46:3,59 --> 0:46:6,14
THERE IS TWO OTHER COROLLARIES. NOSE THESE
ARE


701
0:46:6,14 --> 0:46:8,69
LESS RELATED, WELL THEY ARE RELATED TO SUCCESSION,


702
0:46:8,69 --> 0:46:12,37
BUT LESS RELATES TO HELICOPSYCHE. MATURE


703
0:46:12,37 --> 0:46:17,7
ECOSYSTEMS HAVE MORE SPECIES THAN EARLY STAGE


704
0:46:17,7 --> 0:46:24,45
ECOSYSTEMS. BUT, THE INCREASE IS NOT AMONG
 AUTOTROPHIC ORGANISMS, IT IS AMONG HETEROTROPHIC


705
0:46:24,45 --> 0:46:28,95
ORGANISMS. SO, PERDATION, PARASITISM, COMPETITION,


706
0:46:28,95 --> 0:46:32,7
ALL OF THAT IS WHAT IS RESULTING IN THE INCREASE


707
0:46:32,7 --> 0:46:35,4
SPECIES RICHNESS. IT IS AMONG HETEROTROPHS
NOT


708
0:46:35,4 --> 0:46:40,89
AMONG AUTOTROPHS. NOW, ONE OTHER THING, PLANTS
AND


709
0:46:40,89 --> 0:46:44,1
ANIMALS IN LATE SUCCESSIONAL STAGES TEND TO
BE MORE


710
0:46:44,1 --> 0:46:47,17
SPECIALIZED. SO MAYBE THEY ARE PARASITES ON


711
0:46:47,17 --> 0:46:51,82
A CERTAIN SPECIES. OR MAYBE THEY ARE FEEDING
ON


712
0:46:51,82 --> 0:46:56,1
ONLY A CERTAIN COMPONENT OF THE ECOSYSTEM.
IN A


713
0:46:56,1 --> 0:46:58,6
WAY ALMOST LIKE COMPETITIVE EXCLUSION, WHICH


714
0:46:58,6 --> 0:47:1,45
REMEMBER TAKES PLACE OVER A LONG PERIODS OF
TIME.


715
0:47:1,45 --> 0:47:5,77
SO THESE 5 RULES ABOUT ECOSYSTEMS ARE REALLY
QUITE,


716
0:47:5,77 --> 0:47:13,6
QUITE IMPORTANT. AND, OFTEN TIMES NARROWER.
AND


717
0:47:13,6 --> 0:47:17,74
AGAIN, THIS SHOULD ALL BE IN YOUR HANDOUTS.
OKAY.


718
0:47:17,74 --> 0:47:19,24
ANYTHING YOU WANT ME TO GO OVER WITH THIS
BEFORE WE


719
0:47:19,24 --> 0:47:25,74
GO TO ONE LAST TOPIC? YES? SO, IN THE FLOWER


720
0:47:25,74 --> 0:47:33,119
POT EXPERIMENT. YEAH. THE ONE, OKAY, LET'S
LOOK


721
0:47:33,119 --> 0:47:37,17
AT THIS. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE HAVE RELEASES
 NITROGEN AND WE HAVE RELEASED PHOSPHORUS.


722
0:47:37,17 --> 0:47:38,26
WE ARE


723
0:47:38,26 --> 0:47:40,68
MEASURING THE RESPONSE BY LOOKING AT THE ALGAE
THAT


724
0:47:40,68 --> 0:47:43,75
IS GROWING ON THE OUTSIDE. THE ONE THAT HAS
THE


725
0:47:43,75 --> 0:47:47,16
MOST ALGAE GROWING WOULD INDICATE THAT THE


726
0:47:47,16 --> 0:47:51,79
SUPPLEMENTATION OF SAY PHOSPHORUS IS WHAT
WAS


727
0:47:51,79 --> 0:47:54,8
NEEDED FOR THE ALGAE TO GROW. SO YOU KNOW
THAT IS


728
0:47:54,8 --> 0:48:1,78
THE LIMITING FACTOR. OKAY. LET'S DO IT AGAIN.


729
0:48:1,78 --> 0:48:4,88
WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE IS THE ALGAE THAT IS GROWING,


730
0:48:4,88 --> 0:48:8,14
BECAUSE IT IS BEING RESTRAINED FROM GROWING
BECAUSE


731
0:48:8,14 --> 0:48:10,83
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OF THAT NUTRIENT THERE.
SO,


732
0:48:10,83 --> 0:48:13,5
WHEN THE NUTRIENT LEECHES OUT AND YOU GET
ALGAL


733
0:48:13,5 --> 0:48:18,44
RESPONSE YOU KNOW THAT IS THE LIMITING FACTOR.


734
0:48:18,44 --> 0:48:22,5
OKAY? THERE IS NO PLANTS AT ALL. THERE IS
NO


735
0:48:22,5 --> 0:48:25,38
PLANTS AT ALL. IT IS A FLOWER POT, AND ACTUALLY


736
0:48:25,38 --> 0:48:28,55
THIS EXPERIMENT WAS DONE, IT WAS DONE BY A
GRADUATE


737
0:48:28,55 --> 0:48:30,57
STUDENT IN COLORADO. SHE WENT ALL OVER THE
UNITED


738
0:48:30,57 --> 0:48:33,56
STATES PUTTING THESE FLOWER POTS IN. AND,


739
0:48:33,56 --> 0:48:38,3
UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES SHE BOUGHT THEM FROM
 MEXICO, WHERE THERE WAS A HIGH IRON CONTENT,


740
0:48:38,3 --> 0:48:38,16
WHICH


741
0:48:38,16 --> 0:48:39,73
SHE DIDN'T REALIZE SHE HAD THIS UNCONTROLLED


742
0:48:39,73 --> 0:48:41,85
VARIABLE AND HAD TO GO BACK AND REPEAT A LOT
OF


743
0:48:41,85 --> 0:48:44,11
THEM. BUT IT WAS AN ACTUAL EXPERIMENT THAT
WAS


744
0:48:44,11 --> 0:48:46,55
DONE. ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE ABOUT 4 MINUTES.
I WANT


745
0:48:46,55 --> 0:48:49,78
TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE PRIBILOF ISLAND SEALS.
WE


746
0:48:49,78 --> 0:48:53,64
WANT TO WRAP THAT STORY UP TODAY. PRIBILOF
ISLANDS


747
0:48:53,64 --> 0:48:59,6
SEALS. WHAT IS, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE POPULATION
IN


748
0:48:59,6 --> 0:49:2,11
THAT PRIBILOF ISLAND STORY WHERE YOU HAVE
GOT 10


749
0:49:2,11 --> 0:49:5,49
THOUSAND BACHELOR MALES BEING HARVESTED EVERY
YEAR.


750
0:49:5,49 --> 0:49:8,28
THE POPULATION IS WELL OVER A MILLION. WHAT
IS


751
0:49:8,28 --> 0:49:9,99
GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE POPULATION? IS IT GOING
TO


752
0:49:9,99 --> 0:49:12,47
DECLINE DRASTICALLY? IS IT GOING TO STAY THE


753
0:49:12,47 --> 0:49:13,97
SAME? IS IT GOING TO INCREASE? WHAT DO YOU


754
0:49:13,97 --> 0:49:18,18
THINK? WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU THINK IT WILL


755
0:49:18,18 --> 0:49:22,65
DECLINE? WHAT DO YOU THINK? STAY THE SAME?


756
0:49:22,65 --> 0:49:24,66
WHAT DO MOST OF YOU THINK IT WILL DO? DECLINE.


757
0:49:24,66 --> 0:49:29,53
HOW MANY OF YOU THINK IT WILL DECLINE? REMEMBER,
 THEY ARE PRODUCING SEALS CONTINUOUSLY. HOW


758
0:49:29,53 --> 0:49:29,73
MANY DO


759
0:49:29,73 --> 0:49:32,84
YOU THINK IT WILL INCREASE? YOU HAVE NO OPINIONS.


760
0:49:32,84 --> 0:49:37,31
COME ON. OKAY. ONE MORE TIME, HOW MANY OF
YOU,


761
0:49:37,31 --> 0:49:39,9
BECAUSE THIS IS THE TYPE OF STUFF YOU WILL
BE


762
0:49:39,9 --> 0:49:41,5
GETTING IN A VERY, VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME,
HOW


763
0:49:41,5 --> 0:49:43,5
MANY OF YOU THINK IF YOU TAKE 30 THOUSAND
OUT OF


764
0:49:43,5 --> 0:49:46,21
THE POPULATION IN A HAREM SYSTEM THAT ARE
NOT


765
0:49:46,21 --> 0:49:48,66
BREEDING, HOW MANY HAD YOU THINK THE POPULATION
IS


766
0:49:48,66 --> 0:49:53,23
GOING TO INCREASE IN NUMBERS? VERSUS HOW MANY
OF


767
0:49:53,23 --> 0:49:55,39
YOU DO YOU THINK IT WILL DECREASE IN NUMBERS?


768
0:49:55,39 --> 0:49:58,31
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, INCREASE OR DECREASE?


769
0:49:58,31 --> 0:50:3,61
DECREASE. WHY? RIGHT. YOU GOT LIMITED NUMBER
OF


770
0:50:3,61 --> 0:50:5,67
MALES MATING. IT IS A HAREM SYSTEM SO YOU
ARE


771
0:50:5,67 --> 0:50:8,38
PULLING 30 THOUSAND OUT. BUT, IN FACT, ALL
OF


772
0:50:8,38 --> 0:50:10,48
THESE MALES ARE MATING AND THE FEMALES ARE


773
0:50:10,48 --> 0:50:14,51
PRODUCING OFFSPRING. OKAY? GUYS, LET ME TELL


774
0:50:14,51 --> 0:50:16,9
YOU. THIS IS THE TYPE THING THAT I AM EXPECTING


775
0:50:16,9 --> 0:50:19,25
YOU TO KNOW. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE BIO1 A
WHERE


776
0:50:19,25 --> 0:50:24,76
 YOU JUST HAVE TO MEMORIZE. OKAY? THE MALES,
THE


777
0:50:24,76 --> 0:50:26,93
BACHELOR MALES ARE NOT MATING BUT THE MALES
THAT


778
0:50:26,93 --> 0:50:29,53
ARE IN THE HAREMS ARE MATING SO OFFSPRING
ARE


779
0:50:29,53 --> 0:50:36,56
CONSTANTLY BEING PRODUCED. OKAY. ANYTHING,
YEAH?


780
0:50:36,56 --> 0:50:39,35
YOU JUST KILLING THE BACHELOR MALES. REMEMBER
THE


781
0:50:39,35 --> 0:50:41,45
ASSIGNMENT WAS, LET'S END ON THIS NOTE, THE


782
0:50:41,45 --> 0:50:45,56
ASSIGNMENT WAS FOR ALL OF YOU TO TALK TO PEOPLE
IN


783
0:50:45,56 --> 0:50:49,78
YOUR DORMS THAT WERE PERHAPS SCIENCE MAJORS
BUT NOT


784
0:50:49,78 --> 0:50:51,73
BIOLOGY BIOLOGISTS AND GO OVER THIS PROBLEM
WITH


785
0:50:51,73 --> 0:50:54,29
THEM. REMEMBER I ASKED YOU SEVERAL THINGS;
WHAT IS


786
0:50:54,29 --> 0:50:56,7
GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE POPULATION? WHAT WOULD


787
0:50:56,7 --> 0:50:58,68
HAPPEN IF WE USED A DIFFERENT METHOD OF KILLING


788
0:50:58,68 --> 0:51:3,19
THEM? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE HAD DIFFERENT


789
0:51:3,19 --> 0:51:5,22
ORGANISMS WE WERE KILLING? WHY WE WERE KILLING


790
0:51:5,22 --> 0:51:9,4
THEM? OKAY? JUST ONE LAST THING. I AM NOT


791
0:51:9,4 --> 0:51:13,64
GIVING YOU ASSIGNMENTS. JUST FOR MY OWN BENEFIT,


792
0:51:13,64 --> 0:51:16,41
IT IS REALLY TO TRY TO HELP YOU GUYS THINK
OF THIS.


793
0:51:16,41 --> 0:53:16,41
SO HAVE A NICE WEEKEND AND I WILL SEE YOU
MONDAY.
