0:0:9,449 --> 0:0:15,79
it just survived almost six hundred
years of torrential rain


5
0:0:15,79 --> 0:0:17,569
cousins of stones make up the site


6
0:0:17,569 --> 0:0:22,68
placed with perfect precision some
weighing more than twenty tongs


7
0:0:22,68 --> 0:0:27,419
each was cut off to moved into place
using only human labor


8
0:0:27,419 --> 0:0:29,3
primitive to me


9
0:0:29,3 --> 0:0:30,659
built on the ambition of a


10
0:0:30,659 --> 0:0:32,59
stock and crap


11
0:0:32,59 --> 0:0:38,93
it is the spectacular legacy of the
greatest and file their medicare


12
0:0:38,93 --> 0:0:40,41
and conquest


13
0:0:40,41 --> 0:0:42,96
this is the city in the sky


14
0:0:42,96 --> 0:0:58,61
macho preacher


15
0:0:58,61 --> 0:1:3,42
pulleys donald razor sharp bridge
high-end e_m_t_s mountainous sits one of


16
0:1:3,42 --> 0:1:6,42
the most spectacular places in the world


17
0:1:6,42 --> 0:1:8,9
much of a feature


18
0:1:8,9 --> 0:1:12,39
touched four hundred and fifteen inches
above the local bombardment


19
0:1:12,39 --> 0:1:16,73
the city once contained everything
required for daily life


20
0:1:16,73 --> 0:1:17,479
houses


21
0:1:17,479 --> 0:1:18,64
fields


22
0:1:18,64 --> 0:1:19,95
water channels


23
0:1:19,95 --> 0:1:34,7
all with breathtaking view


24
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:37,62
but might you be chu is no ordinary city


25
0:1:37,62 --> 0:1:41,98
started amongst its terraces uh...
enigmatic structures


26
0:1:41,98 --> 0:1:45,84
magnificent temples somehow linked with
the sun


27
0:1:45,84 --> 0:1:47,569
undergrads and disturbing


28
0:1:47,569 --> 0:1:49,41
perhaps


29
0:1:49,41 --> 0:1:54,58
they provide tantalizing clues as to why
anyone would build such poor beating


30
0:1:54,58 --> 0:1:59,43
terrain


31
0:1:59,43 --> 0:2:3,299
the sites selected is a particularly
difficult one just remote technical


32
0:2:3,299 --> 0:2:5,62
standpoint


33
0:2:5,62 --> 0:2:9,55
architect vince lee believes that no one
would choose to be okay


34
0:2:9,55 --> 0:2:11,719
without good reason


35
0:2:11,719 --> 0:2:14,389
there's very little workspaces just on a
very sharp


36
0:2:14,389 --> 0:2:15,639
leverage


37
0:2:15,639 --> 0:2:18,389
there's almost no flatlands


38
0:2:18,389 --> 0:2:20,319
so why would anyone built


39
0:2:20,319 --> 0:2:22,989
in this impossible locations


40
0:2:22,989 --> 0:2:28,719
what drove much of peaches makers to
construct a city


41
0:2:28,719 --> 0:2:32,69
on says lying in the forging oven and
cry


42
0:2:32,69 --> 0:2:33,159
and the creation


43
0:2:33,159 --> 0:2:42,499
of alleged


44
0:2:42,499 --> 0:2:45,309
in fourteen thirty eight trying to what
he is


45
0:2:45,309 --> 0:2:47,7
launched a massive attack on the
neighbors


46
0:2:47,7 --> 0:2:53,89
income


47
0:2:53,89 --> 0:2:57,349
with the enemy pleased at the gates of
his capital the bojenka and perhaps lead


48
0:2:57,349 --> 0:2:59,139
to safety


49
0:2:59,139 --> 0:3:2,499
but his son was defiant


50
0:3:2,499 --> 0:3:6,189
are


51
0:3:6,189 --> 0:3:8,839
spurred on by a vision predicting
victory


52
0:3:8,839 --> 0:3:14,499
delayed the into into a seemingly
impossible struck


53
0:3:14,499 --> 0:3:23,499
ayala


54
0:3:23,499 --> 0:3:26,74
digestive problems incapacity invaders


55
0:3:26,74 --> 0:3:29,299
and proclaimed their young leader here


56
0:3:29,299 --> 0:3:30,459
bestowing upon him


57
0:3:30,459 --> 0:3:32,58
a prophetic can you name


58
0:3:32,58 --> 0:3:34,639
puja kooky


59
0:3:34,639 --> 0:3:42,359
transformer perfectly


60
0:3:42,359 --> 0:3:48,629
and pressure could be wasted no time
living up to his title


61
0:3:48,629 --> 0:3:51,259
exceedingly apart from his father


62
0:3:51,259 --> 0:3:55,419
he embarked upon a campaign to conquer
neighboring nations


63
0:3:55,419 --> 0:3:57,99
after cookies military might


64
0:3:57,99 --> 0:3:59,139
quickly prevails


65
0:3:59,139 --> 0:4:2,809
within his lifetime he laid the
groundwork for an empire that would


66
0:4:2,809 --> 0:4:9,109
stretch up and down the pacific coast of
south america


67
0:4:9,109 --> 0:4:13,679
i think of him as a sort of alexander
the great the andes


68
0:4:13,679 --> 0:4:20,189
alter and explorer peter frost has
traced income history for thirty years


69
0:4:20,189 --> 0:4:21,949
press secretary was the man


70
0:4:21,949 --> 0:4:27,41
pretending 'cause from regional power
and the cost of value into an empire the


71
0:4:27,41 --> 0:4:31,31
biggest and by the america's ever saw


72
0:4:31,31 --> 0:4:36,24
spreading from modern-day columbia is
north to chile and argentina inside


73
0:4:36,24 --> 0:4:42,52
the empire of include would come undone
modality of more than ten million people


74
0:4:42,52 --> 0:4:45,58
but you could keep order the series of
massive


75
0:4:45,58 --> 0:4:47,53
dates that would help is on the control


76
0:4:47,53 --> 0:4:49,909
this box territory


77
0:4:49,909 --> 0:4:56,79
but military engineering was any part of
the empress grandparent


78
0:4:56,79 --> 0:4:58,779
such a cutie also plan to stay


79
0:4:58,779 --> 0:5:1,349
calculus city to demonstrate his policy


80
0:5:1,349 --> 0:5:3,219
new status


81
0:5:3,219 --> 0:5:6,749
much of that you can accommodate up to
one thousand people


82
0:5:6,749 --> 0:5:11,129
yet it was built higher in the andes
mountains huntington sixty kilometers


83
0:5:11,129 --> 0:5:16,58
from the center of his empire


84
0:5:16,58 --> 0:5:20,659
some experts think it was a royal
retreat


85
0:5:20,659 --> 0:5:23,889
the ruling paradigms have it at the
moment


86
0:5:23,889 --> 0:5:27,439
is that this was a winter palace


87
0:5:27,439 --> 0:5:29,33
of the past pretty


88
0:5:29,33 --> 0:5:33,969
and he held his court here for two or
three months during the winter


89
0:5:33,969 --> 0:5:38,339
the peter frost believes this theory is
too limited to seize it just slip into


90
0:5:38,339 --> 0:5:40,409
thinking european you know


91
0:5:40,409 --> 0:5:45,11
henry the eighth stands in court or
whatever at windsor castle and uh... for


92
0:5:45,11 --> 0:5:47,119
signing might find that


93
0:5:47,119 --> 0:5:48,82
inadequate

for prostate cancer is reliant
inconsiderate truly score


95
0:5:56,289 --> 0:6:0,759
the inca worship natural features of the
landscape and the heavens honoring them


96
0:6:0,759 --> 0:6:2,549
as gods


97
0:6:2,549 --> 0:6:8,58
who stephens extended to the
anthropological t


98
0:6:8,58 --> 0:6:13,589
but we have to remember that vehicle
nato and perot was quite as simple as


99
0:6:13,589 --> 0:6:16,36
that gardening he was the leader of the
religion


100
0:6:16,36 --> 0:6:18,849
he was considered to be sending divine


101
0:6:18,849 --> 0:6:22,39
or fully designed and the son of the sun


102
0:6:22,39 --> 0:6:26,4
analysis formal position within the inca
empire


103
0:6:26,4 --> 0:6:28,71
as so allot of his


104
0:6:28,71 --> 0:6:32,359
activity must have been a religious


105
0:6:32,359 --> 0:6:35,859
that much impeaching researchers have
identified a unique combination of


106
0:6:35,859 --> 0:6:41,479
natural features to create a religious
phenomenon known as axis mundi


107
0:6:41,479 --> 0:6:45,509
a secret sent


108
0:6:45,509 --> 0:6:49,36
the site is a spiritual union of the sky


109
0:6:49,36 --> 0:6:51,979
thank goodness


110
0:6:51,979 --> 0:6:56,139
sacred mountain slightly compass points
from actual petri


111
0:6:56,139 --> 0:7:1,58
directly above that amount and overlooks
the site chinese the custom nation known


112
0:7:1,58 --> 0:7:3,8
as the southern cross


113
0:7:3,8 --> 0:7:11,249
who's perfect alignment in the courtroom
signifies the start of the hottest


114
0:7:11,249 --> 0:7:17,52
much happy to be surrounded by natural
features imbued with spiritual sickness


115
0:7:17,52 --> 0:7:35,859
making it a unique place perpetual kruti
to worship and communion with the calls


116
0:7:35,859 --> 0:7:39,889
now that patrick routine pictures in
this site for his spiritual retreat


117
0:7:39,889 --> 0:7:42,24
his engineers mia mortals


118
0:7:42,24 --> 0:7:46,53
had to achieve the vision affect god
impressed


119
0:7:46,53 --> 0:7:49,8
i think they are ever probably decide
well nevertheless


120
0:7:49,8 --> 0:7:51,27
that's where i want my


121
0:7:51,27 --> 0:7:52,4
noted


122
0:7:52,4 --> 0:7:55,879
palace it so it's up to you guys to
figure out a do it


123
0:7:55,879 --> 0:8:0,84
for decades vince lee has wrestled with
the mystery of how they can comfortably


124
0:8:0,84 --> 0:8:3,539
system


125
0:8:3,539 --> 0:8:7,759
the terrain is a jungle covered richer
fractured iraq at an altitude of two


126
0:8:7,759 --> 0:8:11,18
thousand four hundred and fifty meters


127
0:8:11,18 --> 0:8:14,859
how detach a coaches engineers tame
dislocation


128
0:8:14,859 --> 0:8:16,5
how to take warren


129
0:8:16,5 --> 0:8:20,369
tons of rock with only the most
primitive of tours


130
0:8:20,369 --> 0:8:24,46
power to protect the site from the heavy
rains earthquakes


131
0:8:24,46 --> 0:8:35,14
the threatened descended tumbling into
the river below


132
0:8:35,14 --> 0:8:38,43
might you be chu is a truly spectacular
sight


133
0:8:38,43 --> 0:8:44,0
but its location caused huge problems
for its buildings


134
0:8:44,0 --> 0:8:45,57
the ridges uneven


135
0:8:45,57 --> 0:8:49,44
strewn with fractured and broken ground


136
0:8:49,44 --> 0:8:54,3
sheer cliffs plunge down to the forests
below


137
0:8:54,3 --> 0:8:54,79
each year


138
0:8:54,79 --> 0:8:57,999
torrential storms conduct two hundred
centimeters of rain onto the


139
0:8:57,999 --> 0:8:59,59
mountainside


140
0:8:59,59 --> 0:9:6,51
it is also prone to earthquakes


141
0:9:6,51 --> 0:9:10,53
it's landslides caused by these
conditions could have carried the city


142
0:9:10,53 --> 0:9:15,35
away


143
0:9:15,35 --> 0:9:18,22
as they began clearing the meant to be
true site


144
0:9:18,22 --> 0:9:22,11
the time is needed to work out a way to
bank of the city to a place designed by


145
0:9:22,11 --> 0:9:28,37
nature to repent of humans


146
0:9:28,37 --> 0:9:32,23
they're spectacular solution is clear to
see today


147
0:9:32,23 --> 0:9:42,11
terraces hundreds of them carved into
the slopes of much of peaches


148
0:9:42,11 --> 0:9:49,25
they hoped you buy an area roughly the
size of twelve football pitches


149
0:9:49,25 --> 0:9:52,5
these terraces cobb usable space from
the mounting


150
0:9:52,5 --> 0:9:55,77
uncontrolled runoff prevent erosion


151
0:9:55,77 --> 0:10:0,7
that you can use these fields to grow
food than ceremonial crops


152
0:10:0,7 --> 0:10:12,35
the terrace waltz also provided decadent
benefit


153
0:10:12,35 --> 0:10:15,92
during the day they absorb heat from the
side


154
0:10:15,92 --> 0:10:19,67
but tonight the walls radiates warmth
into the bathroom which would have


155
0:10:19,67 --> 0:10:25,64
protected the crops


156
0:10:25,64 --> 0:10:28,99
but the terraces had an even more
important function


157
0:10:28,99 --> 0:10:30,98
reinforcing the slowed


158
0:10:30,98 --> 0:10:35,49
which pulls away at a gradient of up to
fifty percent


159
0:10:35,49 --> 0:10:39,6
the secret is in the design of the
terror schools


160
0:10:39,6 --> 0:10:40,85
these walls a slipped back


161
0:10:40,85 --> 0:10:42,56
all packed with at about


162
0:10:42,56 --> 0:10:44,21
five degree angle


163
0:10:44,21 --> 0:10:46,499
bracing the hillside by pushing against
it


164
0:10:46,499 --> 0:10:48,34
and channeling the weight of the soul


165
0:10:48,34 --> 0:10:51,5
into the ground below


166
0:10:51,5 --> 0:10:54,63
the terraces were critical to support
the construction of hundreds of


167
0:10:54,63 --> 0:10:55,46
structure


168
0:10:55,46 --> 0:11:0,2
someone mountain slopes


169
0:11:0,2 --> 0:11:3,88
and that is more to the status is than
meets the eye


170
0:11:3,88 --> 0:11:7,72
recent excavations repeal one of the
hidden secrets of touch equities


171
0:11:7,72 --> 0:11:10,0
engineer


172
0:11:10,0 --> 0:11:14,41
sixty percent of mucho teacher is
underground


173
0:11:14,41 --> 0:11:16,31
after eating up the terrain


174
0:11:16,31 --> 0:11:17,83
clearing the rock


175
0:11:17,83 --> 0:11:19,64
impacted in crevices


176
0:11:19,64 --> 0:11:20,779
uncertainties engineer


177
0:11:20,779 --> 0:11:22,67
as caffeine a download


178
0:11:22,67 --> 0:11:34,18
system from swine


179
0:11:34,18 --> 0:11:36,62
they put them on stands at the bottom


180
0:11:36,62 --> 0:11:39,869
then increasingly smaller stands almost
immediately


181
0:11:39,869 --> 0:11:45,17
continue to surface


182
0:11:45,17 --> 0:11:47,41
and then they added sametime homeless


183
0:11:47,41 --> 0:11:50,45
and tops


184
0:11:50,45 --> 0:11:54,15
this ingenious design gave the waltz a
solid foundation


185
0:11:54,15 --> 0:11:57,31
and the smaller stones on talked with
the larger below


186
0:11:57,31 --> 0:12:1,53
forces rainwater to percolate down
slowly no cracks


187
0:12:1,53 --> 0:12:6,84
and disperse evenly through the terrace
slowing regulating the flow of water and


188
0:12:6,84 --> 0:12:10,2
preventing the erosion of topsoil


189
0:12:10,2 --> 0:12:13,79
at the bottom of this uh... on the
inside if it out of school


190
0:12:13,79 --> 0:12:18,21
the water is charming sideways towards
one of the larger canals to drain the


191
0:12:18,21 --> 0:12:24,5
site so that it flows harmlessly into
the valley


192
0:12:24,5 --> 0:12:28,8
the sophistication of the terraces is
just a hint of brilliantly adapted


193
0:12:28,8 --> 0:12:32,41
income weather


194
0:12:32,41 --> 0:12:37,4
that ingenuity was vital when it came to
sourcing materials to build logic which


195
0:12:37,4 --> 0:12:39,36
is sacred city


196
0:12:39,36 --> 0:12:43,38
he's an ambitious plan required tons of
stuff


197
0:12:43,38 --> 0:12:47,35
bringing materials up the mountain
without wheeled vehicles couple forces


198
0:12:47,35 --> 0:12:49,64
would have been almost impossible


199
0:12:49,64 --> 0:13:0,62
fortunately patrick reduced emissions
had a solution


200
0:13:0,62 --> 0:13:5,21
giant granite voters was strewn all
across the ridge


201
0:13:5,21 --> 0:13:8,4
because just a little blocked that much
on the side


202
0:13:8,4 --> 0:13:11,55
weighs about a hundred and seventy five
pounds which is to say you know i can


203
0:13:11,55 --> 0:13:12,8
pick it up


204
0:13:12,8 --> 0:13:16,22
you know and and that would be one of
the smaller stones in the project almost


205
0:13:16,22 --> 0:13:20,38
all the stones in those buildings or at
least update were bigger


206
0:13:20,38 --> 0:13:24,92
somehow one institution constructs
weighing up to twenty times from the


207
0:13:24,92 --> 0:13:27,21
quality to the site


208
0:13:27,21 --> 0:13:30,32
the logistics of creating architecture


209
0:13:30,32 --> 0:13:33,3
or enormous


210
0:13:33,3 --> 0:13:35,25
for professor susan miles


211
0:13:35,25 --> 0:13:40,48
incas greatest challenge was the lack of
sophisticated equipment


212
0:13:40,48 --> 0:13:43,91
this is not a culture with wheels with
kraft animals with


213
0:13:43,91 --> 0:13:45,34
the kinds of


214
0:13:45,34 --> 0:13:50,55
uh... machines that we take for granted
this is using human labor to move things


215
0:13:50,55 --> 0:13:54,58
destroying end in the seventeenth
century illustrates how the income might


216
0:13:54,58 --> 0:13:58,81
have pulled it off


217
0:13:58,81 --> 0:14:3,43
incur we taunton animal fibers into
ficus trends


218
0:14:3,43 --> 0:14:7,96
amid twisted the strands in to great
lengths of strong rope


219
0:14:7,96 --> 0:14:9,42
using these groups


220
0:14:9,42 --> 0:14:13,0
such approaches work crews would have
been able to drive cubes turns into


221
0:14:13,0 --> 0:14:17,62
place


222
0:14:17,62 --> 0:14:20,48
but even the level of service would
present a problem


223
0:14:20,48 --> 0:14:22,25
this matter


224
0:14:22,25 --> 0:14:25,71
the fiction created beneath the rockies
imu


225
0:14:25,71 --> 0:14:29,3
and the leading edge of raw constantly
scoops up there


226
0:14:29,3 --> 0:14:31,79
creating even more resistance


227
0:14:31,79 --> 0:14:35,72
such a good easter masons have to find
ways of overcoming this


228
0:14:35,72 --> 0:14:37,509
first to lighten the load


229
0:14:37,509 --> 0:14:39,68
they rough shape the granite inquiry


230
0:14:39,68 --> 0:14:47,78
chipping off the excess with
hammerstein's


231
0:14:47,78 --> 0:14:53,44
but much of the choose quantity you can
still see waste in mason's left them all


232
0:14:53,44 --> 0:14:57,11
you can see the all around the this this
section of the rock they've been cutting


233
0:14:57,11 --> 0:14:59,1
santana stands


234
0:14:59,1 --> 0:15:3,46
cutting this service end of the block
would eventually so lost and then they


235
0:15:3,46 --> 0:15:4,69
would start to


236
0:15:4,69 --> 0:15:10,11
work it into a shape that they could use
the building


237
0:15:10,11 --> 0:15:12,799
once they had a march to mostly shaped


238
0:15:12,799 --> 0:15:16,98
employed yet another shrewd trick to
help them moved


239
0:15:16,98 --> 0:15:18,619
but very clever they would take that


240
0:15:18,619 --> 0:15:22,239
bottom of the stone smooth off they
would chip off all the edges all the way


241
0:15:22,239 --> 0:15:25,929
around so that that ended up slightly
convex like the bottom of the boat or a


242
0:15:25,929 --> 0:15:26,97
barge


243
0:15:26,97 --> 0:15:27,829
and that way


244
0:15:27,829 --> 0:15:31,1
ticketno x_-rated easily without here
just to do


245
0:15:31,1 --> 0:15:36,52
limited turner quite easily dash


246
0:15:36,52 --> 0:15:40,52
the workers might also come to the
ground with small stones and gravel


247
0:15:40,52 --> 0:15:42,45
which act like war zones


248
0:15:42,45 --> 0:15:45,77
so that's a huge blocks from the law


249
0:15:45,77 --> 0:15:48,57
this huge slab granite at metro feature


250
0:15:48,57 --> 0:15:50,49
abandoned into working


251
0:15:50,49 --> 0:15:56,33
gives us a snapshot work in progress


252
0:15:56,33 --> 0:15:59,21
these techniques work well for smaller
stains


253
0:15:59,21 --> 0:16:3,71
but as evidence from you get to the
statues of easter island suggests


254
0:16:3,71 --> 0:16:10,9
moving largest earns requires the use of
other techniques


255
0:16:10,9 --> 0:16:14,56
most people think lowers were used
routinely will big stones ninety-degree


256
0:16:14,56 --> 0:16:17,2
rollers are very hard to use in the
field


257
0:16:17,2 --> 0:16:20,23
their possible use going up going
downhill the problem is you have to


258
0:16:20,23 --> 0:16:22,98
little friction you can't control the
stove


259
0:16:22,98 --> 0:16:27,22
you're fighting the keystone sinet zero
round all the time


260
0:16:27,22 --> 0:16:39,2
and in the tight workspace on the
mountain ridge this approved


261
0:16:39,2 --> 0:16:42,91
there wasn't enough space to have dozens
of men polling groups


262
0:16:42,91 --> 0:16:46,72
especially when placing stands on the
new perfectly


263
0:16:46,72 --> 0:16:50,36
fees for sticking could prove to find
ways to reduce the number of workers


264
0:16:50,36 --> 0:16:58,82
needed to move lobsters up and down the
slopes


265
0:16:58,82 --> 0:17:2,15
what you really want is what we call
sleepers switches


266
0:17:2,15 --> 0:17:5,35
like roars but they're fixed they can't
roll


267
0:17:5,35 --> 0:17:9,28
and across that you can move a slight
quite easily


268
0:17:9,28 --> 0:17:14,37
vince lee believes he knows how they can
come move to stands around the site


269
0:17:14,37 --> 0:17:19,16
he says they may have used mechanism
sleds why this letter on the ground the


270
0:17:19,16 --> 0:17:22,37
leader of a string this letter in the
wonder garages that the wrongs


271
0:17:22,37 --> 0:17:23,25
stick out


272
0:17:23,25 --> 0:17:26,11
beyond upright on the side to the latest
on the ground


273
0:17:26,11 --> 0:17:29,5
going to take a second one for on top of
the first one


274
0:17:29,5 --> 0:17:33,28
and you put your stone on top of the
second latter now with levers you can


275
0:17:33,28 --> 0:17:38,71
apply force between you know rigors of
the slide the sliding sled is carrying


276
0:17:38,71 --> 0:17:43,13
the stone and the latter that stuck to
the ground by gravity


277
0:17:43,13 --> 0:17:49,48
rejection status routinely and i think
the intersted to in close quarters


278
0:17:49,48 --> 0:17:53,48
this technique would have allowed the
inca tombstones over the city rough


279
0:17:53,48 --> 0:17:55,14
terrain


280
0:17:55,14 --> 0:17:59,2
it also means you don't have a fancy
road is up to the latter just sleepy


281
0:17:59,2 --> 0:18:3,679
plead for all you want lower and for all
the other news call the countryside


282
0:18:3,679 --> 0:18:8,65
using clever techniques incur found ways
of moving stones across the difficult


283
0:18:8,65 --> 0:18:10,23
site


284
0:18:10,23 --> 0:18:17,36
but the job


285
0:18:17,36 --> 0:18:21,6
recruiting such an enormous workforce
might seem a clinton prospect


286
0:18:21,6 --> 0:18:24,9
here in ca and prayer


287
0:18:24,9 --> 0:18:26,82
this challenge was to use in the mail


288
0:18:26,82 --> 0:18:33,42
and it was manage through taxation


289
0:18:33,42 --> 0:18:37,69
incas subjects could pay off the taxes
that go to the empire by providing


290
0:18:37,69 --> 0:18:39,809
physical labor


291
0:18:39,809 --> 0:18:42,5
overseas assembled huge work crews


292
0:18:42,5 --> 0:18:44,499
and these citizen workers


293
0:18:44,499 --> 0:18:49,21
had passed a budget used to have a slave
labor


294
0:18:49,21 --> 0:18:52,7
you know you can make slaves go to work
but you can't make them do a good job


295
0:18:52,7 --> 0:18:55,22
leads and they can do is look busy all
day long


296
0:18:55,22 --> 0:18:59,18
then that the workers that did this inka
stuff took the time to do it right we


297
0:18:59,18 --> 0:19:2,95
think that's probably because they had
some stage in the results they work


298
0:19:2,95 --> 0:19:6,49
proud of what they were doing as opposed
to simply


299
0:19:6,49 --> 0:19:14,85
being forced to do it by overlords


300
0:19:14,85 --> 0:19:17,43
despite the care they taken


301
0:19:17,43 --> 0:19:21,81
inka builders were about to discover
that it doesn't take much to undo weeks


302
0:19:21,81 --> 0:19:24,16
of work


303
0:19:24,16 --> 0:19:27,62
in this land of heavy rains and unstable
slopes


304
0:19:27,62 --> 0:19:29,159
one tiny mistake


305
0:19:29,159 --> 0:19:38,39
can bring everything crashing down


306
0:19:38,39 --> 0:19:43,63
touched on a precarious mountain ridge
machu peaches engineers were engaged in


307
0:19:43,63 --> 0:19:46,98
a constant battle with gravity


308
0:19:46,98 --> 0:19:51,169
the terraces they had so carefully
constructed sculpted the mountainside


309
0:19:51,169 --> 0:19:52,74
supporting the city


310
0:19:52,74 --> 0:19:59,26
anchoring it to the landscape


311
0:19:59,26 --> 0:20:4,68
but today in the lower terraces a
disruption can be seen in the pattern


312
0:20:4,68 --> 0:20:8,2
something not attended schools onto the
language


313
0:20:8,2 --> 0:20:13,37
others disappeared and i think i think
blanket


314
0:20:13,37 --> 0:20:14,29
higher-ups


315
0:20:14,29 --> 0:20:18,71
so steep slope is no shaken off the soil
wants clinton


316
0:20:18,71 --> 0:20:19,809
this


317
0:20:19,809 --> 0:20:21,48
was a landslide


318
0:20:21,48 --> 0:20:24,97
uh... has given away on the natural
fault line


319
0:20:24,97 --> 0:20:27,84
damaging the texas


320
0:20:27,84 --> 0:20:30,429
believed to be a slow but destructive of
any


321
0:20:30,429 --> 0:20:35,57
it stretches a hundred and forty meters
down the hillside


322
0:20:35,57 --> 0:20:37,71
remain


323
0:20:37,71 --> 0:20:42,5
project which is what cruise contracted
as always assessing the coolest


324
0:20:42,5 --> 0:20:45,43
implementing the plan and repairing the
damage


325
0:20:45,43 --> 0:20:49,43
there so you shouldn't is familiar to
modern-day engineers but five hundred


326
0:20:49,43 --> 0:20:50,6
years ago


327
0:20:50,6 --> 0:20:56,549
it was revolution


328
0:20:56,549 --> 0:21:0,97
but you could use manned carter drainage
channels above the disrupted terraces to


329
0:21:0,97 --> 0:21:2,96
redirect surface water


330
0:21:2,96 --> 0:21:9,1
and prevent for the damage


331
0:21:9,1 --> 0:21:12,809
they couldn't afford to take any chances


332
0:21:12,809 --> 0:21:16,7
if the heavy rains of the region had
said to the foundations


333
0:21:16,7 --> 0:21:24,919
the water-logged substructure may have
slid away with catastrophic results


334
0:21:24,919 --> 0:21:27,419
building by building all by war


335
0:21:27,419 --> 0:21:32,64
the engineers punctuated the site with
training job placement on the spot


336
0:21:32,64 --> 0:21:38,8
a hundred and thirteen


337
0:21:38,8 --> 0:21:44,4
in heavy rains these channels diverted
water into a large storm sewer


338
0:21:44,4 --> 0:21:49,69
fit safely emptied into the rain forest
gump one thing in that i will see an and


339
0:21:49,69 --> 0:21:53,5
must be to his approval to standing on
the surface


340
0:21:53,5 --> 0:21:56,95
and as much as it rains anna sometimes
there is really hot here that's always


341
0:21:56,95 --> 0:22:0,16
training and why you never see it


342
0:22:0,16 --> 0:22:4,38
once the land was cleared in these firm
foundations were laid off


343
0:22:4,38 --> 0:22:8,94
but you could use to make sense to build
the homes classes and temples would make


344
0:22:8,94 --> 0:22:10,7
up the site


345
0:22:10,7 --> 0:22:13,51
as always they've worked with nature


346
0:22:13,51 --> 0:22:15,12
sculpting


347
0:22:15,12 --> 0:22:23,31
so that he had the buildings flute
gracefully across the mountain top


348
0:22:23,31 --> 0:22:24,63
most cultures


349
0:22:24,63 --> 0:22:28,56
sort of cut the top off we certainly do
for example in our culture just cut the


350
0:22:28,56 --> 0:22:32,76
top off into the building on top of
somehow the incas managed to celebrate


351
0:22:32,76 --> 0:22:37,36
the natural contour of the land and a
natural amenities of the land


352
0:22:37,36 --> 0:22:42,87
and enhance them with their structures
rather than uh... or at work contrary to


353
0:22:42,87 --> 0:22:46,309
them very unusual and beautifully done


354
0:22:46,309 --> 0:22:48,11
temples for worship


355
0:22:48,11 --> 0:22:49,49
poses for a living


356
0:22:49,49 --> 0:22:54,87
bathing areas underground plaza for
gatherings in gangs


357
0:22:54,87 --> 0:22:59,2
only the rock walls remain


358
0:22:59,2 --> 0:23:3,669
thatched roofs once act on these
structures and ship the heavy rains


359
0:23:3,669 --> 0:23:6,21
but that's not all they had withstand


360
0:23:6,21 --> 0:23:10,54
in this half hour while you do can get
to have very strong winds sometimes in


361
0:23:10,54 --> 0:23:11,73
the andes and


362
0:23:11,73 --> 0:23:14,45
at flows over the top of the roof like


363
0:23:14,45 --> 0:23:17,5
and flying over the top of the wing


364
0:23:17,5 --> 0:23:19,679
of an aircraft and is listed underneath


365
0:23:19,679 --> 0:23:20,58
anika does


366
0:23:20,58 --> 0:23:22,7
left there is straight off


367
0:23:22,7 --> 0:23:27,26
so the roofs needed to be launched from
each of the structure


368
0:23:27,26 --> 0:23:29,4
think i had strong wrote


369
0:23:29,4 --> 0:23:30,58
but little else


370
0:23:30,58 --> 0:23:31,58
as always


371
0:23:31,58 --> 0:23:36,32
from the solution mister


372
0:23:36,32 --> 0:23:39,62
if you look at the uh... end of the
building here you can see the always


373
0:23:39,62 --> 0:23:41,94
stand pegs


374
0:23:41,94 --> 0:23:44,37
and if you follow the line of the table
and


375
0:23:44,37 --> 0:23:46,78
you can see these rang stands


376
0:23:46,78 --> 0:23:52,58
sat and sunday when this was part of the
system for securing the roofing sanden


377
0:23:52,58 --> 0:24:0,97
reflects aerials


378
0:24:0,97 --> 0:24:4,69
the roof makes for each of the hundred
and seventy structures that make up the


379
0:24:4,69 --> 0:24:11,97
urban section of my tribute you will
build and assembled onsite


380
0:24:11,97 --> 0:24:15,48
but the truly remarkable craftsmanship
using these features


381
0:24:15,48 --> 0:24:16,75
windows and dogs


382
0:24:16,75 --> 0:24:23,32
framed out of wrong


383
0:24:23,32 --> 0:24:28,58
these distinctive trapeze illegal shapes
of the roxanne golden window frames take


384
0:24:28,58 --> 0:24:34,429
us back to the height of income cult
room power


385
0:24:34,429 --> 0:24:39,58
each one was carlton placed by highly
skilled stone masons


386
0:24:39,58 --> 0:24:43,86
the masons joins us turns without using
cement removed


387
0:24:43,86 --> 0:24:45,57
get the seems oxen


388
0:24:45,57 --> 0:24:49,61
tight fate does martingale architect


389
0:24:49,61 --> 0:24:53,25
you often hear people say oh you can't
get a knife blade in detroit


390
0:24:53,25 --> 0:24:56,38
he can't do anything in the jury in some
of these places that the stone just


391
0:24:56,38 --> 0:24:59,779
simply changes color a little as it goes
across the truth


392
0:24:59,779 --> 0:25:3,57
it is racquel


393
0:25:3,57 --> 0:25:8,7
party committees craftsman to achieve
such quality without i'm trumbull seems


394
0:25:8,7 --> 0:25:9,88
impossible


395
0:25:9,88 --> 0:25:11,559
get the stones the cross check


396
0:25:11,559 --> 0:25:19,89
fit together precise


397
0:25:19,89 --> 0:25:23,919
researchers have found a vital clues to
the inka technique in these large


398
0:25:23,919 --> 0:25:28,73
granite chunks left unfinished much a
patient


399
0:25:28,73 --> 0:25:33,1
smooth pock marks in this interesting to
take the use of smaller stones called


400
0:25:33,1 --> 0:25:34,32
hammerstein


401
0:25:34,32 --> 0:25:38,429
to shape the rock


402
0:25:38,429 --> 0:25:42,97
interested workers pounded the surface
of the granite with these rounded stones


403
0:25:42,97 --> 0:25:44,629
obtained from britain france


404
0:25:44,629 --> 0:25:45,429
until


405
0:25:45,429 --> 0:25:47,279
they had a smooth surface


406
0:25:47,279 --> 0:25:48,929
company dust


407
0:25:48,929 --> 0:25:53,39
as the next stone was laid the stone
mason used imprints in the dust as a


408
0:25:53,39 --> 0:25:56,29
guide to areas needing further


409
0:25:56,29 --> 0:26:0,82
using progressively smaller understands
the mason city do closer and closer


410
0:26:0,82 --> 0:26:4,88
fixed until the facing top and bottom
sentences


411
0:26:4,88 --> 0:26:8,57
perfect now


412
0:26:8,57 --> 0:26:13,48
this method created a unique feature
income architecture


413
0:26:13,48 --> 0:26:16,629
you'll never find a straight line for a
little corner


414
0:26:16,629 --> 0:26:17,65
in anika


415
0:26:17,65 --> 0:26:20,73
building unless it's done by accident
you'll never find that


416
0:26:20,73 --> 0:26:24,94
you'll see sights which superficially
appear to be sort of square off stones


417
0:26:24,94 --> 0:26:26,9
but if you started and carefully


418
0:26:26,9 --> 0:26:30,59
they weren't square alderdice slightly
offs where they they


419
0:26:30,59 --> 0:26:34,75
and this is very very difficult to do it
as long as always the change of chintz


420
0:26:34,75 --> 0:26:38,27
people discovered that the easy way to
put two big stones together is to


421
0:26:38,27 --> 0:26:39,96
flatten off the site


422
0:26:39,96 --> 0:26:45,34
benefit that you flip charts together
will never see that it's a building


423
0:26:45,34 --> 0:26:49,22
how would you be inka managed to get
these irregular shaped stones to match


424
0:26:49,22 --> 0:26:51,8
up so perfect


425
0:26:51,8 --> 0:26:56,34
once again the stones themselves provide
the clues


426
0:26:56,34 --> 0:27:2,86
these walls have sexual slightly and
pulled the stands apart


427
0:27:2,86 --> 0:27:4,57
what they've done here


428
0:27:4,57 --> 0:27:7,7
is they've made a perfect chilling


429
0:27:7,7 --> 0:27:8,63
between each stunned


430
0:27:8,63 --> 0:27:12,3
all the way to the fact that hold this
is the stone


431
0:27:12,3 --> 0:27:17,62
and not only that but it's once faces
conclave than the others contracts sows


432
0:27:17,62 --> 0:27:20,36
that totally fitted together as very


433
0:27:20,36 --> 0:27:22,72
difficult way to accomplish


434
0:27:22,72 --> 0:27:25,94
the same perfect fit confirmed all over
the site


435
0:27:25,94 --> 0:27:32,44
both in smaller stones and in the larger
ones


436
0:27:32,44 --> 0:27:35,81
they appear to have been created by the
same method if


437
0:27:35,81 --> 0:27:40,32
removing and repeating regardless of
sons


438
0:27:40,32 --> 0:27:41,85
so the question is


439
0:27:41,85 --> 0:27:43,7
out of the chief that fit


440
0:27:43,7 --> 0:27:46,47
vince lee thinks he may have to be
honest


441
0:27:46,47 --> 0:27:48,38
it's called scraping


442
0:27:48,38 --> 0:27:52,49
a technique sometimes used by you don't
cut in campus defective regular milk


443
0:27:52,49 --> 0:27:54,8
surfaces together


444
0:27:54,8 --> 0:27:55,37
as much a teacher


445
0:27:55,37 --> 0:27:59,42
the stone masons transferred the shape
of once turned to richmond


446
0:27:59,42 --> 0:28:4,42
using a protracted to mirror the edge of
one surface them up to and shipped it to


447
0:28:4,42 --> 0:28:6,61
fix the opposite step


448
0:28:6,61 --> 0:28:9,55
well it's not important to either
surface is flat


449
0:28:9,55 --> 0:28:11,59
all we know is that they will be perfect


450
0:28:11,59 --> 0:28:15,75
matches for each other and then we can
one-time slide the stones together


451
0:28:15,75 --> 0:28:18,3
they'll have to fit


452
0:28:18,3 --> 0:28:20,16
to build a senator row upon wrote


453
0:28:20,16 --> 0:28:26,6
precisely fitted stones against each
other in new york perfectly


454
0:28:26,6 --> 0:28:30,39
budget committees masons also carefully
automated systems tracing them


455
0:28:30,39 --> 0:28:36,929
vertically and horizontally to spread
the loot evenly throughout the temple


456
0:28:36,929 --> 0:28:41,9
on top of the building the perfect
alignment of the finally fiji huge bloc


457
0:28:41,9 --> 0:28:47,7
seems to be playing craft


458
0:28:47,7 --> 0:28:50,35
these all stony projections


459
0:28:50,35 --> 0:28:52,93
provide the clues to its construction


460
0:28:52,93 --> 0:28:56,46
to access the top and bottom portions of
the rocks they used a system of


461
0:28:56,46 --> 0:28:58,1
believers


462
0:28:58,1 --> 0:28:59,98
this is how it works


463
0:28:59,98 --> 0:29:4,62
stone collar scarf to groove into one
side granite block


464
0:29:4,62 --> 0:29:8,89
labor's used to wouldn't post to lead to
the block apollo ankle


465
0:29:8,89 --> 0:29:14,21
allowing sliders to shake the top and
bottom sides walk with hummus tufts


466
0:29:14,21 --> 0:29:16,32
this created


467
0:29:16,32 --> 0:29:23,46
into the war


468
0:29:23,46 --> 0:29:26,19
that record crop in the store up in the
air which before


469
0:29:26,19 --> 0:29:28,5
spooked by with some good reason


470
0:29:28,5 --> 0:29:33,64
but uh... but i've done it and it works


471
0:29:33,64 --> 0:29:37,86
the careful efforts apache produced in
mason's uh... evident all over the


472
0:29:37,86 --> 0:29:44,149
finest structures that much of peter


473
0:29:44,149 --> 0:29:46,35
at the top of the staircase and hard


474
0:29:46,35 --> 0:29:50,1
opposite the palace stands the city's
crown jewel


475
0:29:50,1 --> 0:29:54,26
are uniquely shaped building


476
0:29:54,26 --> 0:29:56,379
extra care has been put into place


477
0:29:56,379 --> 0:29:58,88
deconstruction


478
0:29:58,88 --> 0:30:3,62
the buildings walls artists actually

479
0:30:3,62 --> 0:30:12,49
the curve of the bedrock creating a semi
circle


480
0:30:12,49 --> 0:30:17,31
the centerpiece of the structure is this
a card standpoint


481
0:30:17,31 --> 0:30:22,71
opposition to play awfully jim
mysterious way


482
0:30:22,71 --> 0:30:26,159
sir what was this fall


483
0:30:26,159 --> 0:30:27,97
after winter solstice


484
0:30:27,97 --> 0:30:30,63
it aligns perfectly with the window


485
0:30:30,63 --> 0:30:42,55
but somehow


486
0:30:42,55 --> 0:30:43,83
i have a randstad


487
0:30:43,83 --> 0:30:47,9
actually i and i still on the first
photographs that was a mistake


488
0:30:47,9 --> 0:30:49,7
on the twenty first of june nineteen
eighty


489
0:30:49,7 --> 0:30:54,8
four peter frost got up before door and
waited for the sun to rise you think of


490
0:30:54,8 --> 0:30:57,48
fast that nothing's gonna happen next
the sun's coming up


491
0:30:57,48 --> 0:31:1,85
and there's no question like no sunday
at seven twenty realizes this


492
0:31:1,85 --> 0:31:3,93
patch of lights suddenly


493
0:31:3,93 --> 0:31:9,47
comes alive you know and then is tacitly
divided by that kind of stones


494
0:31:9,47 --> 0:31:13,9
for peter frost this is evidence that
the temple was used as a symbol of


495
0:31:13,9 --> 0:31:15,47
observatory


496
0:31:15,47 --> 0:31:17,169
there's really a m


497
0:31:17,169 --> 0:31:20,27
vindicates a lot of people's ideas
actually about being concerned about


498
0:31:20,27 --> 0:31:23,6
what was being done here


499
0:31:23,6 --> 0:31:26,28
this is the temple of the sermon


500
0:31:26,28 --> 0:31:29,59
and it has been dark undersigned


501
0:31:29,59 --> 0:31:47,59
what lies beneath contains puzzling
clues that continue tourist info


502
0:31:47,59 --> 0:31:52,37
beneath the temple of the sunlight is
this mysterious substructure


503
0:31:52,37 --> 0:31:56,34
the entire building with integrated
almost seamlessly into a colossal


504
0:31:56,34 --> 0:31:57,649
greenwich boomed


505
0:31:57,649 --> 0:31:59,19
a stone giant


506
0:31:59,19 --> 0:32:4,69
that serves as the temple's foundation


507
0:32:4,69 --> 0:32:9,29
of very fine example of the harmonious
architecture than the incas digitas


508
0:32:9,29 --> 0:32:12,399
over instead of c l_ slacking off a
piece of land and plunking down a


509
0:32:12,399 --> 0:32:16,47
building on it they've built around the
landscape they they made the landscape


510
0:32:16,47 --> 0:32:19,11
parts of the architecture


511
0:32:19,11 --> 0:32:23,37
but that's not where it ends within it
that is a flat future


512
0:32:23,37 --> 0:32:27,5
some say this is a small train departure
mama


513
0:32:27,5 --> 0:32:29,24
the us mother


514
0:32:29,24 --> 0:32:30,83
you can see that they've


515
0:32:30,83 --> 0:32:36,289
actually busted a huge block of stones
of as this front page of it


516
0:32:36,289 --> 0:32:41,1
sheer project which is still nations
exploited this natural came


517
0:32:41,1 --> 0:32:42,299
they expanded it


518
0:32:42,299 --> 0:32:45,11
and adorned it with hand-carved nishu


519
0:32:45,11 --> 0:32:48,43
picasa stepping like feature into the
natural stone


520
0:32:48,43 --> 0:32:53,21
and carved out an extraordinary
hourglass shaped inlay


521
0:32:53,21 --> 0:32:54,8
they made the joints square


522
0:32:54,8 --> 0:32:58,7
rather than london in the classic
entrance to her


523
0:32:58,7 --> 0:33:1,4
but walked was it's purpose


524
0:33:1,4 --> 0:33:4,67
peter frost thinks he knows the answer


525
0:33:4,67 --> 0:33:8,4
in the general aspect of this is his
uh...


526
0:33:8,4 --> 0:33:9,61
some kind of


527
0:33:9,61 --> 0:33:13,11
buried important ceremonial place


528
0:33:13,11 --> 0:33:19,37
as it's been speculated a royal
mausoleum when a cat monies


529
0:33:19,37 --> 0:33:23,58
unlike egyptian fairest incumbent
president not prepare for a resurrection


530
0:33:23,58 --> 0:33:27,7
in the afterlife


531
0:33:27,7 --> 0:33:31,6
they believe that after death they
entered another form of life and


532
0:33:31,6 --> 0:33:36,87
continued to wield power overt daily
events


533
0:33:36,87 --> 0:33:39,5
the mummies were fed and cared for


534
0:33:39,5 --> 0:33:44,34
they were included responded guests
doing important rituals and ceremonies


535
0:33:44,34 --> 0:33:48,19
including ceremonies of sacrifice


536
0:33:48,19 --> 0:33:52,73
when the high priests solemnly offered
precious metals


537
0:33:52,73 --> 0:33:55,22
on the most significant separate
occasions


538
0:33:55,22 --> 0:34:0,27
offered up the lives of young children


539
0:34:0,27 --> 0:34:9,229
no offering was great


540
0:34:9,229 --> 0:34:14,109
budget committee chose this ritual site
because it was so close to the dogs


541
0:34:14,109 --> 0:34:15,629
but the function properly


542
0:34:15,629 --> 0:34:18,769
it would have to support up to a
thousand people


543
0:34:18,769 --> 0:34:21,859
and those people would need water


544
0:34:21,859 --> 0:34:25,469
at an altitude of two thousand four
hundred and fifty meters on a narrow


545
0:34:25,469 --> 0:34:26,819
margin ridge


546
0:34:26,819 --> 0:34:31,859
much impeach you is well above the most
obvious loves the organ bump over time


547
0:34:31,859 --> 0:34:33,33
which snakes a dizzying


548
0:34:33,33 --> 0:34:36,219
four hundred and fifty meters


549
0:34:36,219 --> 0:34:41,29
yes but you could use engineers found in
this powering landscape that by some


550
0:34:41,29 --> 0:34:42,7
miracle


551
0:34:42,7 --> 0:34:46,739
the colts provided them with the water
they need


552
0:34:46,739 --> 0:34:49,799
the inca did not have the benefit of
satellite imagery


553
0:34:49,799 --> 0:34:50,909
if they had


554
0:34:50,909 --> 0:34:55,459
they would have seen that the medical
was in fact due to to geological faults


555
0:34:55,459 --> 0:34:59,899
immense cracks or ruptures in the
granite


556
0:34:59,899 --> 0:35:3,32
at some point the ridge between these
forms collapsed


557
0:35:3,32 --> 0:35:10,329
sliding down roots to form the site of
much of peaches


558
0:35:10,329 --> 0:35:14,739
one of the false fronts is a giant slope
a fractured granite


559
0:35:14,739 --> 0:35:16,559
offerings shrouded in cologne


560
0:35:16,559 --> 0:35:21,259
the resulting rain water streams down
the granite wall and collects forming a


561
0:35:21,259 --> 0:35:28,249
natural spring that was discovered by
patrick routines engineers


562
0:35:28,249 --> 0:35:31,959
to capture the water the income
constructed an enormous war more than


563
0:35:31,959 --> 0:35:35,209
fourteen in the hostages law


564
0:35:35,209 --> 0:35:36,82
picketed the stone houston


565
0:35:36,82 --> 0:35:41,289
so that water would collect behind the
wall and see-through under control


566
0:35:41,289 --> 0:35:43,589
into a large basin


567
0:35:43,589 --> 0:35:51,149
even today interest-free


568
0:35:51,149 --> 0:35:54,94
with the site seven hundred and forty
nine meters from the reservoir


569
0:35:54,94 --> 0:35:59,529
project which is engineers filter water
canals with cuts and sudden precisely


570
0:35:59,529 --> 0:36:3,149
designed at the water flowed at a
perfect rate


571
0:36:3,149 --> 0:36:6,119
with minimum c


572
0:36:6,119 --> 0:36:9,31
whatever they did they did as
efficiently as possible


573
0:36:9,31 --> 0:36:13,43
these were not wasteful people these are
not people through a time or energy or


574
0:36:13,43 --> 0:36:17,199
resources they did everything as quickly
and as


575
0:36:17,199 --> 0:36:19,409
well as they could


576
0:36:19,409 --> 0:36:23,879
elevated on its own carries the canal
carried up to a hundred and fifty liters


577
0:36:23,879 --> 0:36:25,339
of water per minute


578
0:36:25,339 --> 0:36:29,659
bypassing the agricultural fields
install houses


579
0:36:29,659 --> 0:36:31,119
its first destination


580
0:36:31,119 --> 0:36:32,36
clearly by design


581
0:36:32,36 --> 0:36:39,589
was the private function of inka emperor
punch scooty


582
0:36:39,589 --> 0:36:45,499
he would have had like a spouse coming
uh... bases the splashed uh... facing


583
0:36:45,499 --> 0:36:46,909
down below


584
0:36:46,909 --> 0:36:51,989
and no doubt is less people to support
services trades and also this is a


585
0:36:51,989 --> 0:36:56,449
debating may have been ceremonial maybe
rachel type of a million years well


586
0:36:56,449 --> 0:36:58,979
every care was taken with the design


587
0:36:58,979 --> 0:37:3,329
parent company she is lined the walls
there was even a train


588
0:37:3,329 --> 0:37:4,619
which is this


589
0:37:4,619 --> 0:37:8,149
water channel cut into sully bedrock
deep


590
0:37:8,149 --> 0:37:15,229
with uh... a little bridge that they've
left here with a water flows out


591
0:37:15,229 --> 0:37:28,959
the empress private box was just one of
sixteen unique hand carved pumpkins


592
0:37:28,959 --> 0:37:32,209
from united made its way throughout the
city


593
0:37:32,209 --> 0:37:34,66
no detail was overlooked


594
0:37:34,66 --> 0:37:38,549
pick up the functions of so that the
waters spilled away from the budget


595
0:37:38,549 --> 0:37:42,369
water filled the distinctive in cold
water jugs


596
0:37:42,369 --> 0:37:44,649
called by the files


597
0:37:44,649 --> 0:37:52,669
for the inka wateman was secret


598
0:37:52,669 --> 0:37:57,179
by mustering water logic which he
demonstrated his godlike powers to


599
0:37:57,179 --> 0:37:58,179
control


600
0:37:58,179 --> 0:38:0,159
forces of the world


601
0:38:0,159 --> 0:38:2,609
and his ambition didn't spend that


602
0:38:2,609 --> 0:38:5,639
of the highest point of the site was the
focal point


603
0:38:5,639 --> 0:38:8,19
patcha kuti secret axis


604
0:38:8,19 --> 0:38:10,149
he controlled the f


605
0:38:10,149 --> 0:38:11,899
he controls the stone


606
0:38:11,899 --> 0:38:14,579
and he controlled water


607
0:38:14,579 --> 0:38:15,609
budget committee


608
0:38:15,609 --> 0:38:27,199
wanted to harness the sunday


609
0:38:27,199 --> 0:38:32,729
tolerating high above mitchell p chu is
one of its most talked about features


610
0:38:32,729 --> 0:38:37,38
but you could use mason scarface
abstract shape from a single piece of


611
0:38:37,38 --> 0:38:40,259
background


612
0:38:40,259 --> 0:38:41,719
i think it looks


613
0:38:41,719 --> 0:38:45,19
absolutely martin absolutely
contemporary


614
0:38:45,19 --> 0:38:46,989
fitness out that they would like to do
it


615
0:38:46,989 --> 0:38:50,729
fatalistic in the museum of modern art
new york and it would look absolutely a


616
0:38:50,729 --> 0:38:52,519
home


617
0:38:52,519 --> 0:38:57,249
while experts concede the system what
purpose this remarkable sculptures serve


618
0:38:57,249 --> 0:39:1,89
it's perfect alignment with the
surrounding geography provides hints to


619
0:39:1,89 --> 0:39:3,209
its function


620
0:39:3,209 --> 0:39:7,89
he'd lies on the north-south line the
can be drawn between monk who end up


621
0:39:7,89 --> 0:39:7,829
kitchen


622
0:39:7,829 --> 0:39:9,629
amounts of contain


623
0:39:9,629 --> 0:39:12,479
the highest peak in the region


624
0:39:12,479 --> 0:39:16,77
this north-south line can be by sick to
my auntie's waistline


625
0:39:16,77 --> 0:39:18,799
drawn from the sculpture itself


626
0:39:18,799 --> 0:39:25,459
two months and make it


627
0:39:25,459 --> 0:39:30,81
pricier on the soda equinox is the son
sits precisely about this culture


628
0:39:30,81 --> 0:39:35,629
and costs no shadow


629
0:39:35,629 --> 0:39:40,349
and amazingly the pilla itself seems to
be column to represent at least tour of


630
0:39:40,349 --> 0:39:43,759
the surrounding peaks


631
0:39:43,759 --> 0:39:47,859
all of this points tantalizingly towards
one of the incas most deeply-held


632
0:39:47,859 --> 0:39:51,79
beliefs


633
0:39:51,79 --> 0:39:55,589
inka may have symbolically tied to send
to this place to prevented from


634
0:39:55,589 --> 0:40:1,839
travelling too far away during the
solstice s


635
0:40:1,839 --> 0:40:4,809
this is the into what time


636
0:40:4,809 --> 0:40:12,859
host of the sun


637
0:40:12,859 --> 0:40:17,299
despite more than five hundred years of
torrential rains earthquakes and


638
0:40:17,299 --> 0:40:22,869
landslides danielle perfection of much
of the future defies logic


639
0:40:22,869 --> 0:40:29,459
but there are places where the inka
engineers worked is not quite so perfect


640
0:40:29,459 --> 0:40:32,16
not far away from the hitching post of
the sun


641
0:40:32,16 --> 0:40:37,89
east wall of the principal tempo sinking
into the ground


642
0:40:37,89 --> 0:40:39,639
what went wrong here


643
0:40:39,639 --> 0:40:43,459
bill on bedrock that wouldn't happen
errors on bedrock by then


644
0:40:43,459 --> 0:40:47,5
survey on the subsoil is being washed
away and it's


645
0:40:47,5 --> 0:40:50,119
gradually sinking


646
0:40:50,119 --> 0:40:53,959
and that any excavation revealed that
the foundations for this great temple


647
0:40:53,959 --> 0:40:56,309
appear to be determine


648
0:40:56,309 --> 0:40:58,589
leading scholars mystified


649
0:40:58,589 --> 0:41:0,689
i don't think we can quite be sure


650
0:41:0,689 --> 0:41:2,949
when the failure took place but


651
0:41:2,949 --> 0:41:6,379
come but it's not typical of ink
construction so there was some other


652
0:41:6,379 --> 0:41:9,989
factor it works and it is entirely
possible that they were under some


653
0:41:9,989 --> 0:41:12,609
pressure to complete that part of the
project


654
0:41:12,609 --> 0:41:16,679
and they just decided to cut corner in
that case


655
0:41:16,679 --> 0:41:19,249
if the trouble account during
construction


656
0:41:19,249 --> 0:41:21,979
why did they not attempt to repair the
damage


657
0:41:21,979 --> 0:41:24,459
as they've done in the taxes


658
0:41:24,459 --> 0:41:28,339
some speculate that the temple collapsed
because when they think a face that


659
0:41:28,339 --> 0:41:32,209
greatest threat


660
0:41:32,209 --> 0:41:35,549
did four years after budget committee
created his empire


661
0:41:35,549 --> 0:41:42,969
an explorer set off to find that you
were


662
0:41:42,969 --> 0:41:44,889
in fourteen ninety-two


663
0:41:44,889 --> 0:41:49,599
christopher columbus sailed from the
small spanish port of palestinian from


664
0:41:49,599 --> 0:41:50,579
canada


665
0:41:50,579 --> 0:41:55,759
out into the atlantic he arrived india
medicare's and opened the door to the


666
0:41:55,759 --> 0:41:57,389
spanish


667
0:41:57,389 --> 0:42:1,109
and back home he stumbles


668
0:42:1,109 --> 0:42:4,419
so it was that less than a hundred years
after project which you found it much


669
0:42:4,419 --> 0:42:5,389
impeachment


670
0:42:5,389 --> 0:42:8,769
the spanish conquistadors shocked at the
empire


671
0:42:8,769 --> 0:42:13,209
mounted or forces and armed with weapons
are known to be in ca


672
0:42:13,209 --> 0:42:21,109
towns


673
0:42:21,109 --> 0:42:25,919
but less and more catastrophic for the
entire than any army fate brought a new


674
0:42:25,919 --> 0:42:27,319
disease


675
0:42:27,319 --> 0:42:29,349
smallpox


676
0:42:29,349 --> 0:42:31,489
millions diet


677
0:42:31,489 --> 0:42:34,549
inka empire crumbled


678
0:42:34,549 --> 0:42:37,689
this once bustling center was up and


679
0:42:37,689 --> 0:42:39,889
with some of the work are finished


680
0:42:39,889 --> 0:42:50,559
stand still waiting for hands to push
them into position


681
0:42:50,559 --> 0:42:55,689
today at the rear of the ill-fated
principal temple huge stones can be seen


682
0:42:55,689 --> 0:42:59,209
clearly intended for the finer finish


683
0:42:59,209 --> 0:43:3,449
you can say have a jut out way beyond
the playing of the wall itself


684
0:43:3,449 --> 0:43:7,359
so undoubtedly this was unfinished
business


685
0:43:7,359 --> 0:43:9,299
and people say uh-oh


686
0:43:9,299 --> 0:43:13,589
so much of the jaws of finished and and
i admire sponsor that is is new york


687
0:43:13,589 --> 0:43:15,109
city finished


688
0:43:15,109 --> 0:43:17,979
no it's not because it's a living city


689
0:43:17,979 --> 0:43:21,309
that constantly things being bill
constantly things being demolished there


690
0:43:21,309 --> 0:43:25,49
was changing this changing that that's
the way it was a much bt tourism is a


691
0:43:25,49 --> 0:43:26,199
living


692
0:43:26,199 --> 0:43:30,769
uh... environment for people who are
here


693
0:43:30,769 --> 0:43:34,79
with the collapse of the entire supply
lines


694
0:43:34,79 --> 0:43:35,46
dinka abandoned


695
0:43:35,46 --> 0:43:36,869
could lead to picture


696
0:43:36,869 --> 0:43:45,809
and the city disappears for four hundred
years


697
0:43:45,809 --> 0:43:49,169
until american archaeologist hiram
bingham


698
0:43:49,169 --> 0:43:53,63
pushed his way through the undergrads
and was confronted by a magnificent


699
0:43:53,63 --> 0:43:55,379
stole


700
0:43:55,379 --> 0:43:57,789
who holds muscle control


701
0:43:57,789 --> 0:44:2,459
but you could do secret city in the sky


702
0:44:2,459 --> 0:44:17,969
mar


703
0:44:17,969 --> 0:44:22,269
conceived to impress the goats into
astounded me a mortals


704
0:44:22,269 --> 0:44:41,249
this great stone city remains unique
achievement


705
0:44:41,249 --> 0:44:44,779
they didn't have much technology but
they were every bit as smart as we are


706
0:44:44,779 --> 0:44:48,399
they just had fewer things to think
about they had fewer tools to work with


707
0:44:48,399 --> 0:44:50,409
your materials to consider


708
0:44:50,409 --> 0:44:53,949
and they probably knew more about
stilled and we will ever cream of


709
0:44:53,949 --> 0:44:56,189
knowing


710
0:44:56,189 --> 0:45:0,63
one of the world's greatest engineering
achievement much impeaching remains a


711
0:45:0,63 --> 0:45:3,389
spot djibouti impatient


712
0:45:3,389 --> 0:45:5,949
tinkers with slightly crazy


713
0:45:5,949 --> 0:45:9,939
brilliantly crazy they did the
extraordinary things things that


714
0:45:9,939 --> 0:45:13,69
nobody else would have thought of doing


715
0:45:13,69 --> 0:45:13,869
building


716
0:45:13,869 --> 0:45:15,999
this extraordinary city here


717
0:45:15,999 --> 0:45:18,539
on top of the nineteen ridge


718
0:45:18,539 --> 0:45:22,71
it's an enduring monument to the really
and spend ingenuity


719
0:45:22,71 --> 0:45:26,13
of the income we don't think that we
know help ought to cut is workers


720
0:45:26,13 --> 0:45:28,61
conquered all of these difficulties


721
0:45:28,61 --> 0:45:37,39
we know that they did because not to
keep to is the evidence


722
0:45:37,39 --> 0:45:42,299
completed or not the site is one of the
most amazing structures in the world


723
0:45:42,299 --> 0:45:47,509
channels feeding the city with an
abundant and constant supply of water


724
0:45:47,509 --> 0:45:53,259
a massive earthquake-proof substructure
supporting terraces stonewall quays


725
0:45:53,259 --> 0:45:58,389
plazas homes and temples a testament to
incur engineering


726
0:45:58,389 --> 0:46:15,169
and the ability to build mega structures
in the most challenging locations


727
0:46:15,169 --> 0:46:32,67
time to an emperor determined to prove
his place among the costs


728
0:46:32,67 --> 0:46:36,299
live


729
0:46:36,299 --> 0:48:36,299
uh...
