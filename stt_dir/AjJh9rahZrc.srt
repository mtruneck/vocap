JASON MOJICA: Hi, it's Jason.


3
0:0:6,38 --> 0:0:7,96
I'm in Doha, Qatar.


4
0:0:7,96 --> 0:0:10,47
I was in town to screen the Vice
Guide to Congo at the Al


5
0:0:10,47 --> 0:0:13,4
Jazeera International
Documentary Festival, which


6
0:0:13,4 --> 0:0:16,43
was taking place in one of the
oldest buildings in Doha--


7
0:0:16,43 --> 0:0:17,57
the Sheraton.


8
0:0:17,57 --> 0:0:20,39
And while it was a nice place,
in a Logan's Run sort of way,


9
0:0:20,39 --> 0:0:22,77
I wanted to get out and see what
else Doha had to offer in


10
0:0:22,77 --> 0:0:27,17
the categories of food,
sports and culture.


11
0:0:27,17 --> 0:0:31,55



12
0:0:31,55 --> 0:0:34,71
Qatar is a tiny little country
jutting out from Saudi Arabia.


13
0:0:34,71 --> 0:0:37,38
Thanks to its plentiful natural
gas reserves, it is


14
0:0:37,38 --> 0:0:39,67
the wealthiest nation
on earth.


15
0:0:39,67 --> 0:0:41,13
What is your name?


16
0:0:41,13 --> 0:0:42,12
JASON MOJICA: Nasam Bashir.


17
0:0:42,12 --> 0:0:44,0
A friend of mine told
me about a shawarma


18
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:46,65
place called Mara Mara.


19
0:0:46,65 --> 0:0:47,865
JASON MOJICA: OK,
can we go there?


20
0:0:47,865 --> 0:0:48,676
NASAM BASHIR: Yeah.


21
0:0:48,676 --> 0:0:50,28
JASON MOJICA: Are we going
to be stuck in traffic?


22
0:0:50,28 --> 0:0:53,124



23
0:0:53,124 --> 0:0:56,3
JASON MOJICA: We drove out to
Old Airport Road to a place


24
0:0:56,3 --> 0:0:58,36
that I'm almost positive
was not the place


25
0:0:58,36 --> 0:0:59,662
my friend had suggested.


26
0:0:59,662 --> 0:1:2,55
But you know, sometimes you just
gotta go with the flow--


27
0:1:2,55 --> 0:1:5,66
especially when the
meter's running.


28
0:1:5,66 --> 0:1:7,315
A friend of mine told
me that this is the


29
0:1:7,315 --> 0:1:8,97
best shawarma in Doha.


30
0:1:8,97 --> 0:1:9,85
Is it true?


31
0:1:9,85 --> 0:1:11,293
Of course it's true.


32
0:1:11,293 --> 0:1:14,534



33
0:1:14,534 --> 0:1:17,7
JASON MOJICA: In my experience
it's the Lebanese who make the


34
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:19,34
best shawarma on the planet,
so I was a bit skeptical.


35
0:1:19,34 --> 0:1:23,16



36
0:1:23,16 --> 0:1:24,63
Hey, hey.


37
0:1:24,63 --> 0:1:25,88
What?


38
0:1:25,88 --> 0:1:33,94



39
0:1:33,94 --> 0:1:35,41
JASON MOJICA: Beef?


40
0:1:35,41 --> 0:1:36,66
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.


41
0:1:36,66 --> 0:1:41,712



42
0:1:41,712 --> 0:1:43,67
JASON MOJICA: I was shocked.


43
0:1:43,67 --> 0:1:46,73
It was probably the best
shawarma I'd ever had--


44
0:1:46,73 --> 0:1:47,4
ever.


45
0:1:47,4 --> 0:1:48,875
Holy shit, that is good.


46
0:1:48,875 --> 0:1:50,24
I can't stop swearing,
it's so good.


47
0:1:50,24 --> 0:1:51,73
It's so good.


48
0:1:51,73 --> 0:1:53,26
It's amazing.


49
0:1:53,26 --> 0:1:57,49
Nope, definitely not the place
my friend recommended.


50
0:1:57,49 --> 0:2:0,61
It had been nearly 24 hours
since I'd had a drink, and


51
0:2:0,61 --> 0:2:2,37
that needed to change.


52
0:2:2,37 --> 0:2:6,24
But that was something easier
said than done.


53
0:2:6,24 --> 0:2:8,91
So here in Doha, just to get a
simple drink, you actually


54
0:2:8,91 --> 0:2:13,399
have to join a club and present
your passport and get


55
0:2:13,399 --> 0:2:15,759
an ID card made.


56
0:2:15,759 --> 0:2:19,58
But in a country where a drink
can be hard to find, it's


57
0:2:19,58 --> 0:2:20,83
worth the trouble.


58
0:2:20,83 --> 0:2:23,18



59
0:2:23,18 --> 0:2:25,2
Now, you could go to one
of the expense tourist


60
0:2:25,2 --> 0:2:27,1
hotels for $20 beers.


61
0:2:27,1 --> 0:2:29,4
But I wanted to see where some
of the zillion foreign workers


62
0:2:29,4 --> 0:2:31,9
who made Doha function
hang out.


63
0:2:31,9 --> 0:2:35,21
Sometimes, though, you have to
be careful what you ask for.


64
0:2:35,21 --> 0:2:37,47
The only women were
on the stage.


65
0:2:37,47 --> 0:2:40,59
But the real talent was on the
dance floor, where men dance


66
0:2:40,59 --> 0:2:44,14
with other men, and it really
wasn't gay at all.


67
0:2:44,14 --> 0:2:46,36
No, really, not at all.

Now, it wasn't just camel racing
that had drawn us out


75
0:3:21,97 --> 0:3:23,51
into the desert, but
the promise of

Is there a coaching practice?


86
0:3:45,215 --> 0:3:46,86
JASON MOJICA: We certainly
weren't going to let a


87
0:3:46,86 --> 0:3:49,95
knowledgeable local stand in the
way of finding robot camel


88
0:3:49,95 --> 0:3:52,63
jockeys, so we pressed on.


89
0:3:52,63 --> 0:3:57,5
Holy shit, these camels
are tied to sandbags.


90
0:3:57,5 --> 0:3:58,64
Hi, camel.


91
0:3:58,64 --> 0:4:1,2
So we came here to see some
camel racing, because we were


92
0:4:1,2 --> 0:4:4,37
told that it was a crazy, crazy
scene, and that the


93
0:4:4,37 --> 0:4:6,18
camels were raced by robots.


94
0:4:6,18 --> 0:4:10,85
And if you have camels and
robots in the same sentence, I


95
0:4:10,85 --> 0:4:12,3
get very, very excited.


96
0:4:12,3 --> 0:4:15,63
And we've only found the camels,
and there are no


97
0:4:15,63 --> 0:4:18,42
robots anywhere.

0:4:18,42 --> 0:4:20,422

OK.

0:4:32,56 --> 0:4:34,61

unquote "excitement" of

blandness of Doha.
