1
0:0:11,924 --> 0:0:16,74
Oh hello, sorry. War! We love it, right?


2
0:0:16,74 --> 0:0:20,773
Blowing stuff up, watching people suffer and die, it's exciting!


3
0:0:20,773 --> 0:0:25,214
Violence, domination, retribution and other attributes of this competitive


4
0:0:25,214 --> 0:0:28,313
warring fascination clearly dominates our media


5
0:0:28,313 --> 0:0:31,682
with films, television and other expressions constantly


6
0:0:31,682 --> 0:0:35,497
glorifying and reinforcing this gesture of conflict.


7
0:0:35,497 --> 0:0:38,12
In fact, it has been found that by the time an average kid


8
0:0:38,12 --> 0:0:40,659
reaches the age of 14 in the West,


9
0:0:40,659 --> 0:0:46,124
he or she has visually witnessed over 8,000 depicted acts of murder.


10
0:0:46,124 --> 0:0:48,645
Given all of this, it might make you wonder:


11
0:0:48,645 --> 0:0:53,22
Does art imitate life, or does life imitate art?


12
0:0:53,22 --> 0:0:57,709
Likewise, isn't it interesting how most of us in America sleep quite well at night


13
0:0:57,709 --> 0:1:0,394
while our military forces routinely invade,


14
0:1:0,394 --> 0:1:3,131
slaughter and steal from other nations at will;


15
0:1:3,131 --> 0:1:6,804
as, of course, all global empires have done historically,


16
0:1:6,804 --> 0:1:10,879
with, this time, a global civilian death toll well over 1 million


17
0:1:10,879 --> 0:1:14,548
in the past decade alone, many of them women and children.


18
0:1:14,548 --> 0:1:19,276
Yet, the same American culture shudders in horror and confusion


19
0:1:19,276 --> 0:1:22,957
when some dude stumbles into an American schoolyard and randomly wipes out


20
0:1:22,957 --> 0:1:26,56
a couple dozen or so kids.


21
0:1:26,56 --> 0:1:30,191
I ask you, by what measure do we differentiate importance


22
0:1:30,191 --> 0:1:32,949
when it comes to the death of different groups of people?


23
0:1:32,949 --> 0:1:35,604
What makes us so special?


24
0:1:35,604 --> 0:1:39,589
While history is certainly full of xenophobic, racist, religious


25
0:1:39,589 --> 0:1:44,422
and nationalist conceits which have served as convenient justifications for


26
0:1:44,422 --> 0:1:48,907
external dehumanization, subjugation and imperial power abuse,


27
0:1:48,907 --> 0:1:53,498
a rather unnoticed yet profound scientific truth has also emerged:


28
0:1:53,498 --> 0:1:57,38
Today, every person on Earth can trace his or her lineage


29
0:1:57,38 --> 0:2:3,924
back to a single common female ancestor who lived about 200,000 years ago.


30
0:2:3,924 --> 0:2:6,846
'Mitochondrial Eve', she is now called,


31
0:2:6,846 --> 0:2:10,674
proving indeed that we are truly one family.


32
0:2:10,674 --> 0:2:15,872
Likewise, the planet Earth, the habitat this family shares, it knows no division.


33
0:2:15,872 --> 0:2:20,635
It is a unified, synergistic system at every turn, fully connected.


34
0:2:20,635 --> 0:2:24,727
It has no idea what a nation, a politician or a racist is.


35
0:2:24,727 --> 0:2:28,253
It has no notion of any such human conceit, for that matter;


36
0:2:28,253 --> 0:2:30,865
for division simply doesn't exist


37
0:2:30,865 --> 0:2:36,109
in the order of nature by which we're all invariably subject.


38
0:2:36,109 --> 0:2:38,548
Mark Twain once wrote


39
0:2:38,548 --> 0:2:42,623
"Man is the only Patriot. He sets himself apart in his country,


40
0:2:42,623 --> 0:2:45,835
under his own flag, and sneers at the other nations,


41
0:2:45,835 --> 0:2:50,354
and keeps multitudinous uniformed assassins on hand at heavy expense


42
0:2:50,354 --> 0:2:52,892
to grab slices of other people's countries,


43
0:2:52,892 --> 0:2:55,905
and keep them from grabbing slices of his.


44
0:2:55,905 --> 0:3:0,774
And in the intervals between campaigns he washes the blood off his hands


45
0:3:0,774 --> 0:3:5,921
and works for 'the universal brotherhood of man'- with his mouth."


46
0:3:5,921 --> 0:3:11,304
While we all love to give lip service to the idea of peace and collaboration,


47
0:3:11,304 --> 0:3:15,455
holding up icons such as Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.


48
0:3:15,455 --> 0:3:19,582
something underneath the surface is clearly holding us back.


49
0:3:19,582 --> 0:3:21,727
Yes, we know for a fact


50
0:3:21,727 --> 0:3:25,507
that if we took the total war budgets of all the nations on Earth


51
0:3:25,507 --> 0:3:29,656
(tens of trillions of dollars over the past quarter century alone)


52
0:3:29,656 --> 0:3:33,753
and applied that energy-producing capital towards creating


53
0:3:33,753 --> 0:3:39,81
an advanced, intelligent, efficient system of Earth/Human management,


54
0:3:39,81 --> 0:3:43,484
not only would poverty and most deprivation be removed from our lives on the global scale


55
0:3:43,484 --> 0:3:46,989
our progressive capacity to create, build and improve


56
0:3:46,989 --> 0:3:49,795
rather than pillage, seek and destroy


57
0:3:49,795 --> 0:3:53,536
could catapult the human family into an age of prosperity


58
0:3:53,536 --> 0:3:55,622
never before seen.


59
0:3:55,622 --> 0:4:1,31
Just imagine. If we took America's Pentagon or Britain's Northwood


60
0:4:1,31 --> 0:4:4,408
along with all the world's advanced military centers,


61
0:4:4,408 --> 0:4:7,172
kicked all the army freaks out...


62
0:4:7,172 --> 0:4:9,485
OK, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be harsh.


63
0:4:9,485 --> 0:4:11,56
I guess we have to do something with them.


64
0:4:11,56 --> 0:4:15,747
Maybe we can just take them all and place them in the Grand Canyon


65
0:4:15,747 --> 0:4:18,539
and just let them beat the piss out of each other,


66
0:4:18,539 --> 0:4:21,475
and hopefully they'll get it out of their systems and move on.


67
0:4:21,475 --> 0:4:24,49
I don't know, we'll figure that out later.


68
0:4:24,49 --> 0:4:27,384
But we, as the intelligent, mature human family


69
0:4:27,384 --> 0:4:29,969
now interested in improving the lives of all,


70
0:4:29,969 --> 0:4:35,123
we use that incredible technology to help assist true developmental progress.


71
0:4:35,123 --> 0:4:40,915
Imagine if the Manhattan Project, which harnessed about 130,000 people,


72
0:4:40,915 --> 0:4:44,675
mostly scientists and technicians, was dedicated not


73
0:4:44,675 --> 0:4:48,659
to building a bomb that could destroy on a scale never before seen;


74
0:4:48,659 --> 0:4:54,72
but rather, utilizing that collaborative drive to solve true global problems,


75
0:4:54,72 --> 0:4:56,304
perhaps those very problems


76
0:4:56,304 --> 0:5:0,392
which are causing the interest in war to begin with.


77
0:5:0,392 --> 0:5:4,37
Today, the hyper-glorified, romanticized obsession with competition,


78
0:5:4,37 --> 0:5:8,49
advantage and conflict has made it into almost every facet of our lives.


79
0:5:8,49 --> 0:5:13,273
Not only do we declare war against virtually everything that annoys us:


80
0:5:13,273 --> 0:5:16,998
'the war on drugs', 'the war on poverty', 'the war on crime',


81
0:5:16,998 --> 0:5:20,969
'the war on terrorism', 'the war on cancer', you name it;


82
0:5:20,969 --> 0:5:24,517
we also, apart from the near constant nationalist wars,


83
0:5:24,517 --> 0:5:28,558
live in a perpetual state of common war or 'class war'


84
0:5:28,558 --> 0:5:31,472
where we battle each other on a daily basis


85
0:5:31,472 --> 0:5:36,424
for unnecessary economic survival and delusions of status.


86
0:5:36,424 --> 0:5:39,17
The fact is, something has been set in motion


87
0:5:39,17 --> 0:5:42,98
that keeps us all on a multilevel war path.


88
0:5:42,98 --> 0:5:46,691
Something in our psychology and, hence, sociology is constantly pushing us


89
0:5:46,691 --> 0:5:51,5
into justifications of these patterns, and as this episode will argue


90
0:5:51,5 --> 0:5:54,504
that something appears to reside at the very foundation


91
0:5:54,504 --> 0:5:57,15
of the socioeconomic condition itself:


92
0:5:57,15 --> 0:6:2,347
a foundation which has given rise to an ever-expanding destructive neurosis


93
0:6:2,347 --> 0:6:6,754
a neurosis clearly characteristic of a culture in decline.


94
0:6:6,754 --> 0:6:9,441
From the creator of the Zeitgeist film trilogy


95
0:6:9,441 --> 0:6:12,37
comes the worst reality show of all time


96
0:6:12,37 --> 0:6:15,633
the real one


97
0:6:15,633 --> 0:6:19,143
GMP Films presents


98
0:6:19,143 --> 0:6:25,34
Culture In Decline


99
0:6:25,34 --> 0:6:35,769
with your guide, Peter Joseph.


100
0:6:35,769 --> 0:6:43,177
Breaking news


101
0:6:43,177 --> 0:6:47,81
This just in: The President has finished an emergency session at the White House


102
0:6:47,81 --> 0:6:49,95
where he announced that the security focus of his administration


103
0:6:49,95 --> 0:6:52,368
will be moving away from the global war on terror,


104
0:6:52,368 --> 0:6:56,472
instead, focusing all available resources against something the administration


105
0:6:56,472 --> 0:6:59,444
has deemed a larger threat to US and international security


106
0:6:59,444 --> 0:7:2,787
than anything recognized before: Nature itself.


107
0:7:2,787 --> 0:7:6,154
That's right, Dodge, the newly declared war against Nature


108
0:7:6,154 --> 0:7:9,54
will be usurping funds from the Department of Homeland Security


109
0:7:9,54 --> 0:7:13,55
effectively replacing it with a new department, the Department of...


110
0:7:13,55 --> 0:7:15,937
I think I'm reading this right:


111
0:7:15,937 --> 0:7:19,515
"Fuck The Earth And The Science It Rode In On."


112
0:7:19,515 --> 0:7:22,776
That's correct, Summer, the administration has already appointed a head


113
0:7:22,776 --> 0:7:27,458
to this new department, the CEO of Monsanto Corporation, Satan himself.


114
0:7:27,458 --> 0:7:30,439
When questioned regarding concerns about a possible conflict of interest


115
0:7:30,439 --> 0:7:33,736
of the new appointee, the Obama administration responded:


116
0:7:33,736 --> 0:7:37,363
"Monsanto's reputation of challenging the vast power of this intolerant,


117
0:7:37,363 --> 0:7:41,19
bullying force that goes by the terrorist name 'Natural Science'


118
0:7:41,19 --> 0:7:43,268
holds great potential for our victory.


119
0:7:43,268 --> 0:7:45,892
We feel if anyone can take down these insurgent laws


120
0:7:45,892 --> 0:7:49,31
which restrict our God-given freedom, it is the professional experience


121
0:7:49,31 --> 0:7:52,547
of our true lord and master: the Prince of Darkness.


122
0:7:52,547 --> 0:7:56,5
We've just been informed that a press conference is now underway


123
0:7:56,5 --> 0:7:58,838
with the Pentagon's spokesperson answering questions.


124
0:7:58,838 --> 0:8:0,927
We now go live to the White House.


125
0:8:0,927 --> 0:8:4,81
As the President said earlier, the greatest barrier to US interests


126
0:8:4,81 --> 0:8:8,25
has been a constant state of offensive interference by this rogue network.


127
0:8:8,25 --> 0:8:12,29
Nature has been forcing its will against our freedom for long enough.


128
0:8:12,29 --> 0:8:16,499
Our economy, our values, the American way of life, it's not negotiable.


129
0:8:16,499 --> 0:8:20,521
Either Nature concedes to our interests and stops terrorizing us


130
0:8:20,521 --> 0:8:22,788
with its hatred of our liberty,


131
0:8:22,788 --> 0:8:25,934
or we will be forced to destroy it.


132
0:8:25,934 --> 0:8:28,736
Next question.


133
0:8:28,736 --> 0:8:30,998
Hi. Joe, from L.A. Times:


134
0:8:30,998 --> 0:8:33,89
Don't you feel it could be a bad idea to move against


135
0:8:33,89 --> 0:8:36,968
a force which has historically never been overcome


136
0:8:36,968 --> 0:8:39,375
or even phased by human action?


137
0:8:39,375 --> 0:8:42,802
Also, I understand Nature has given a set of demands which, if met,


138
0:8:42,802 --> 0:8:45,267
would cease many of its counterattacks.


139
0:8:45,267 --> 0:8:48,764
Has the administration considered just meeting these demands?


140
0:8:48,764 --> 0:8:53,222
Listen Joe, we don't negotiate with terrorists, and I've seen Nature's demands,


141
0:8:53,222 --> 0:8:57,302
full of queer Communist propaganda such a balance and sustainability.


142
0:8:57,302 --> 0:9:0,263
It even demands that we shut down our infinite growth consumption economy


143
0:9:0,263 --> 0:9:3,979
to make way for something where we are to be slaves to some oppressive


144
0:9:3,979 --> 0:9:6,53
natural regeneration respect.


145
0:9:6,53 --> 0:9:10,695
Listen, I didn't spend 35 years defending this country


146
0:9:10,695 --> 0:9:14,835
to have some metaphysical terrorist group with science on its side


147
0:9:14,835 --> 0:9:17,597
ruin what has made this nation great.


148
0:9:17,597 --> 0:9:21,585
No further questions.


149
0:9:21,585 --> 0:9:25,272
(P. Joseph) When we think of war, we usually think about gun-wielding soldiers,


150
0:9:25,272 --> 0:9:29,77
tanks, flame throwers, fancy metal honors and other theatrics.


151
0:9:29,77 --> 0:9:32,131
Yet, when we step outside the theater,


152
0:9:32,131 --> 0:9:35,278
digging deeper in our examination of the world around us


153
0:9:35,278 --> 0:9:38,186
we find that war is actually a state of mind,


154
0:9:38,186 --> 0:9:42,391
a reaction, driven by some type of competitive condition.


155
0:9:42,391 --> 0:9:46,293
If we had to classify the different levels of large scale competition,


156
0:9:46,293 --> 0:9:48,992
we might end up with two broad categories:


157
0:9:48,992 --> 0:9:51,975
imperial war and class war.


158
0:9:51,975 --> 0:9:54,591
Imperial war, otherwise known as national war,


159
0:9:54,591 --> 0:9:57,975
is when an aggressor nation decides to invade some other nation,


160
0:9:57,975 --> 0:10:1,208
justified by some form of perceived threat.


161
0:10:1,208 --> 0:10:4,944
Back in the day, this threat often appeared as purely ideological with


162
0:10:4,944 --> 0:10:9,129
religious groups battling it out to make sure they were in good with God,


163
0:10:9,129 --> 0:10:12,25
while in a mildly more literate scientific world today,


164
0:10:12,25 --> 0:10:16,273
the threat is, more often than not, pitched as direct to each of us.


165
0:10:16,273 --> 0:10:19,303
Such as, a rogue nation getting a nuclear weapon


166
0:10:19,303 --> 0:10:22,502
to blow up your grandmother's bingo tournament


167
0:10:22,502 --> 0:10:25,808
or perhaps a crazed state-funded hijacker crashing a plane


168
0:10:25,808 --> 0:10:28,497
into your favorite taco stand (bastards!).


169
0:10:28,497 --> 0:10:32,714
Regardless, in virtually every historical case, the justification for war


170
0:10:32,714 --> 0:10:38,222
put forward for public digestion has always been far from the truth.


171
0:10:38,222 --> 0:10:40,756
You see, there is indeed always a true threat,


172
0:10:40,756 --> 0:10:44,77
but that threat has little to do with the vast majority of the population.


173
0:10:44,77 --> 0:10:48,575
Instead, it is a threat that bothers only the highest echelons


174
0:10:48,575 --> 0:10:52,752
of social hierarchy, an elitist upper class self-preservation


175
0:10:52,752 --> 0:10:56,3
based around a loss of broad power and control.


176
0:10:56,3 --> 0:10:59,88
When was the last time the citizenry actually cried out for war?


177
0:10:59,88 --> 0:11:3,605
It doesn't happen, only the politicians go for it.


178
0:11:3,605 --> 0:11:7,775
Since the establishment would be hard-pressed to explain to their citizens


179
0:11:7,775 --> 0:11:11,379
that they are going to invade some nation for its natural resources,


180
0:11:11,379 --> 0:11:16,438
maintain currency domination, enable freedom for transnational corporations,


181
0:11:16,438 --> 0:11:19,628
along with other generally economic concerns


182
0:11:19,628 --> 0:11:22,365
to secure the interests of the upper 1%,


183
0:11:22,365 --> 0:11:26,396
various superficial, psychological ploys are used instead.


184
0:11:26,396 --> 0:11:29,184
The most common today is the moral crusade:


185
0:11:29,184 --> 0:11:33,915
We must not tolerate this regime using military force against its own people.


186
0:11:33,915 --> 0:11:37,282
(P. Joseph) coupled with some basic yet irrational threat of attack.


187
0:11:37,282 --> 0:11:40,7
Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat,


188
0:11:40,7 --> 0:11:44,956
not just to the US, but to Iran's neighbors and our allies.


189
0:11:44,956 --> 0:11:50,318
(P. Joseph) In the words of famed sociologist Thorstein Veblen, writing from 1917:


190
0:11:50,318 --> 0:11:53,564
"Any warlike enterprise that is hopeful to be entered on


191
0:11:53,564 --> 0:11:56,136
must have the moral sanction of the community.


192
0:11:56,136 --> 0:12:0,155
It consequently becomes the first concern of the warlike statesman


193
0:12:0,155 --> 0:12:5,84
to put this moral force in train for the adventure on which he is bent."


194
0:12:5,84 --> 0:12:8,1
You see, a large part of the imperial war is the psychological war


195
0:12:8,1 --> 0:12:12,369
against the domestic citizenry itself.


196
0:12:12,369 --> 0:12:15,52
The US government spends billions of dollars every year


197
0:12:15,52 --> 0:12:18,475
on public relations and recruitment alone,


198
0:12:18,475 --> 0:12:20,976
producing signs like this one:


199
0:12:20,976 --> 0:12:23,763
"For our nation, for us all."


200
0:12:23,763 --> 0:12:27,255
Is it me, or does that sound like Orwellian doublespeak?


201
0:12:27,255 --> 0:12:30,714
If it's 'for our nation', then it clearly isn't 'for us all', as the human species


202
0:12:30,714 --> 0:12:34,694
is the closest thing we have to 'all'. If it's referring to all of us in the nation


203
0:12:34,694 --> 0:12:38,661
that would be hideously redundant, right? I think what they mean to say


204
0:12:38,661 --> 0:12:42,15
in this warm, loving community slogan is:


205
0:12:42,15 --> 0:12:47,743
"For our nation, screw the rest."


206
0:12:47,743 --> 0:12:52,317
Cooking with Pepé


207
0:12:52,317 --> 0:12:55,491
Hello! Welcome to the show! My name is Pepé.


208
0:12:55,491 --> 0:12:57,84
Today, I've got something very special for you,


209
0:12:57,84 --> 0:13:0,383
a true international delicacy:


210
0:13:0,383 --> 0:13:3,614
War!


211
0:13:3,614 --> 0:13:6,524
To prepare for war is a very delicate matter.


212
0:13:6,524 --> 0:13:10,487
The first thing we need to do is create some spicy tension


213
0:13:10,487 --> 0:13:13,396
to put fire in your belly.


214
0:13:13,396 --> 0:13:20,61
The first ingredient we need is a well-tempered provocation.


215
0:13:20,61 --> 0:13:23,859
Provocations are, of course, seasonal and subject to personal taste.


216
0:13:23,859 --> 0:13:27,11
So may I suggest something along the lines [of]


217
0:13:27,11 --> 0:13:32,91
a marinated Gulf of Tonkin,


218
0:13:32,91 --> 0:13:38,59
a robust Pearl Harbor,


219
0:13:38,59 --> 0:13:44,653
and if you're feeling bored, a bustling 9/11.


220
0:13:44,653 --> 0:13:50,726
Then, we let that cook for a bit and prepare our second ingredient,


221
0:13:50,726 --> 0:13:54,837
a special sauté to give life to our fiery dish:


222
0:13:54,837 --> 0:14:4,303
the mainstream media.


223
0:14:4,303 --> 0:14:11,119
Can you just smell the propaganda and delectable ignorance?


224
0:14:11,119 --> 0:14:13,692
After we get a nice sizzle going,


225
0:14:13,692 --> 0:14:18,173
we now add our final, most important ingredient:


226
0:14:18,173 --> 0:14:20,35
the delicious soldiers.


227
0:14:20,35 --> 0:14:23,937
The most ripe soldiers tend to grow in the more poor,


228
0:14:23,937 --> 0:14:28,597
rural areas of the world, often with limited literacy.


229
0:14:28,597 --> 0:14:31,352
You want to pick them around


230
0:14:31,352 --> 0:14:36,514
18, 19, because their brains are very immature and quite yummy,


231
0:14:36,514 --> 0:14:41,679
perfect for participation in our war meal.


232
0:14:41,679 --> 0:14:50,176
We mix it all together.


233
0:14:50,176 --> 0:14:55,456
Perhaps add a few, some preservatives like patriotism


234
0:14:55,456 --> 0:14:57,517
(not too much)


235
0:14:57,517 --> 0:14:59,369
jingoism,


236
0:14:59,369 --> 0:15:10,988
and, of course, our very special secret sauce.


237
0:15:10,988 --> 0:15:22,431
OK! And we are ready! The moment you have all been waiting for.


238
0:15:22,431 --> 0:15:30,292
I present to you the greatest international delicacy of all time: War.


239
0:15:30,292 --> 0:15:32,555
Bon appétit.


240
0:15:32,555 --> 0:15:36,62
(P. Joseph) Perhaps one of the most amusing aspects of national war


241
0:15:36,62 --> 0:15:39,497
is the circus-like pageantry and ceremonialism.


242
0:15:39,497 --> 0:15:42,984
Cute costumes, little hats, shiny pieces of metal,


243
0:15:42,984 --> 0:15:45,398
various parades and official posturing


244
0:15:45,398 --> 0:15:51,7
and all adornments and theatrics that give this air of honor and authority.


245
0:15:51,7 --> 0:15:53,846
Of course, this is not to dismiss the true sacrifice


246
0:15:53,846 --> 0:15:58,901
of those who have given their lives in war, as there are always two sides.


247
0:15:58,901 --> 0:16:2,888
This true honor comes from a position of working to help others,


248
0:16:2,888 --> 0:16:6,512
not exploit them. Just as we hold the bravery of a firefighter


249
0:16:6,512 --> 0:16:10,171
who enters a burning building to save a child in high regard,


250
0:16:10,171 --> 0:16:15,567
the intention to help society through military service is indeed a noble gesture.


251
0:16:15,567 --> 0:16:19,84
Even though, sadly enough, 99% of those who enter the military


252
0:16:19,84 --> 0:16:24,273
with such noble intentions are more often than not being exploited


253
0:16:24,273 --> 0:16:28,78
for the criminal purposes of the corporate state.


254
0:16:28,78 --> 0:16:33,351
Still, you have to be impressed by the skill to give credence to an idea


255
0:16:33,351 --> 0:16:36,325
merely because of the nature of its presentation.


256
0:16:36,325 --> 0:16:40,184
In fact, whether it's academia, the news media, government itself


257
0:16:40,184 --> 0:16:44,348
the military or anything else in society, our culture tends to believe


258
0:16:44,348 --> 0:16:50,122
and respect people merely because of their presentation, confidence and rhetoric,


259
0:16:50,122 --> 0:17:0,931
not the actual meaning or reasoning of the communication itself.


260
0:17:0,931 --> 0:17:4,1
Did you know that the first television sets of the 1950s


261
0:17:4,1 --> 0:17:7,319
were actually supposed to be used as prosthetic replacement heads


262
0:17:7,319 --> 0:17:10,427
to give new hope for those who had been tragically decapitated?


263
0:17:10,427 --> 0:17:12,648
But, technology, weight and


264
0:17:12,648 --> 0:17:15,963
cord length being what they were at the time, it failed.


265
0:17:15,963 --> 0:17:19,71
Luckily, they could play other things besides the faces of the deceased


266
0:17:19,71 --> 0:17:23,964
and TV sets sold nationwide, and it's all true!


267
0:17:23,964 --> 0:17:31,89
You know why? Because you heard it from some guy in a tie.


268
0:17:31,89 --> 0:17:36,596
In the end, once the traditional, propagandized illusions in defense


269
0:17:36,596 --> 0:17:40,859
of the act of organized human murder and resource theft have been overridden,


270
0:17:40,859 --> 0:17:46,253
dismissing such shallow justifications as paternalism, honor and protectionism,


271
0:17:46,253 --> 0:17:50,1
we realize that war today is actually an inherent characteristic


272
0:17:50,1 --> 0:17:53,35
of the propertied, scarcity-driven business system.


273
0:17:53,35 --> 0:17:55,6
Major General Smedley D. Butler,


274
0:17:55,6 --> 0:17:59,4
one of the most notable and decorated officers in US history


275
0:17:59,4 --> 0:18:4,38
stated the following with respect to the business of war in 1935:


276
0:18:4,38 --> 0:18:9,15
"I spent 33 years and 4 months in active military service and during that period


277
0:18:9,15 --> 0:18:13,27
I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for big business,


278
0:18:13,27 --> 0:18:15,419
for Wall Street and the bankers.


279
0:18:15,419 --> 0:18:18,8
In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.


280
0:18:18,8 --> 0:18:21,256
I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico


281
0:18:21,256 --> 0:18:25,764
safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba


282
0:18:25,764 --> 0:18:29,57
a decent place for the National City boys to collect revenues in.


283
0:18:29,57 --> 0:18:33,39
I helped in the raping of a half a dozen Central American republics


284
0:18:33,39 --> 0:18:36,18
for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua


285
0:18:36,18 --> 0:18:41,12
for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902 -1912.


286
0:18:41,12 --> 0:18:45,83
I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916.


287
0:18:45,83 --> 0:18:49,432
I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903.


288
0:18:49,432 --> 0:18:52,338
In China in 1927, I helped see to it that


289
0:18:52,338 --> 0:18:55,679
Standard Oil went on its way unmolested.


290
0:18:55,679 --> 0:18:59,627
Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints.


291
0:18:59,627 --> 0:19:2,81
The best he could do was operate his racket in three districts.


292
0:19:2,81 --> 0:19:6,82
I operated on three continents." -Major General Smedley D. Butler


293
0:19:6,82 --> 0:19:10,13
Given all of this, it's unique how the general public tends to separate


294
0:19:10,13 --> 0:19:13,79
the day-to-day competitive business acumen


295
0:19:13,79 --> 0:19:17,195
from the severe form of competitive violent warfare,


296
0:19:17,195 --> 0:19:21,89
when there is very good evidence to show that they are deeply intermeshed.


297
0:19:21,89 --> 0:19:25,2
To gain some perspective on this, we now welcome back our resident guru,


298
0:19:25,2 --> 0:19:27,818
Louie the Logic Gremlin.


299
0:19:27,818 --> 0:19:30,403
Ah! Before we get into the questions, I do have a letter here


300
0:19:30,403 --> 0:19:33,642
that I would like to read to you and get your opinion on.


301
0:19:33,642 --> 0:19:38,202
It reads: "Dear Peter, I really enjoy the new show.


302
0:19:38,202 --> 0:19:41,473
I think it is helping get these important messages across.


303
0:19:41,473 --> 0:19:46,949
However, I am disappointed with the crude Louie the Logic Gremlin character,


304
0:19:46,949 --> 0:19:50,569
as it is just irritating and hideously stupid.


305
0:19:50,569 --> 0:19:54,29
Also, would you please stop eating when you are speaking in the show.


306
0:19:54,29 --> 0:19:57,404
It's really disgusting and annoying.


307
0:19:57,404 --> 0:19:59,402
Rock on. Joe."


308
0:19:59,402 --> 0:20:3,148
I'm sorry, Joe. Louie, what do you think about that?


309
0:20:3,148 --> 0:20:5,908
Aesthetic orientation is largely a cultural phenomenon.


310
0:20:5,908 --> 0:20:8,64
Your decision to directly agitate your audience is odd,


311
0:20:8,64 --> 0:20:10,979
but not without its communicative merit.


312
0:20:10,979 --> 0:20:17,271
Toats! [Totally] Sorry, Joe, shit stays.


313
0:20:17,271 --> 0:20:21,338
All right, so what's the skinny on war, man?


314
0:20:21,338 --> 0:20:25,479
Aren't we just crazy animals that have to be in endless conflict


315
0:20:25,479 --> 0:20:28,5
with each other due to our biology or something?


316
0:20:28,5 --> 0:20:31,638
While the conflict reaction is predictable in our evolutionary psychology,


317
0:20:31,638 --> 0:20:33,899
the assumption of inevitably is absurdly false.


318
0:20:33,899 --> 0:20:36,876
Human nature exists as a propensity of interaction with conditions.


319
0:20:36,876 --> 0:20:39,26
If you reward competition and produce scarcity


320
0:20:39,26 --> 0:20:42,85
as we do today, you will perpetuate a conflict propensity.


321
0:20:42,85 --> 0:20:44,368
If you work to ease stress and reward balance,


322
0:20:44,368 --> 0:20:47,74
you will generate a collaborative propensity.  - OK, I see what you're saying.


323
0:20:47,74 --> 0:20:51,24
You're saying that war is actually a system consequence?


324
0:20:51,24 --> 0:20:54,938
Correct. The real underlying conflict is the war against social balance itself.


325
0:20:54,938 --> 0:20:57,138
National war is really a form of class war.


326
0:20:57,138 --> 0:21:0,578
Just as we have an economic hierarchy from lower to upper classes in America,


327
0:21:0,578 --> 0:21:3,43
the world is stratified in the same way, for the same reasons.


328
0:21:3,43 --> 0:21:5,274
In this case with terms such as


329
0:21:5,274 --> 0:21:8,143
"super-powers", "sub-powers" and "vassal states".  - Interesting.


330
0:21:8,143 --> 0:21:12,31
So, how do we resolve this war tendency then?


331
0:21:12,31 --> 0:21:14,496
Remove the social reinforcements of it.


332
0:21:14,496 --> 0:21:17,579
If society shifts to rewarding balance, abundance and collaboration,


333
0:21:17,579 --> 0:21:19,44
then your species may have a chance.


334
0:21:19,44 --> 0:21:21,91
Otherwise, you people are likely fucked, as you are


335
0:21:21,91 --> 0:21:25,212
too immature right now to handle your own technological power.   - Gotcha


336
0:21:25,212 --> 0:21:27,965
Well, thank you for your time, Louie.


337
0:21:27,965 --> 0:21:30,384
To gain some public consensus on the issue,


338
0:21:30,384 --> 0:21:33,586
we now turn live to our east coast 'Culture in Decline' correspondent,


339
0:21:33,586 --> 0:21:36,29
Big Scottie D, who's live in New York City


340
0:21:36,29 --> 0:21:40,27
to talk with people about what they think of war.


341
0:21:40,27 --> 0:21:43,84
Well, thank you, Peter. I am here in New York City


342
0:21:43,84 --> 0:21:46,592
on a beautiful cold day and


343
0:21:46,592 --> 0:21:50,1
I'm going to try to find some people to maybe talk to.


344
0:21:50,1 --> 0:21:52,439
Excuse me, excuse me, Ma'am, would you like to...


345
0:21:52,439 --> 0:21:55,109
Excuse me,  Sir... Sir, would you like to talk about the war?


346
0:21:55,109 --> 0:21:57,787
- What?  - Would you like to talk about the war, Sir?  - No.


347
0:21:57,787 --> 0:22:0,119
- Would you like to talk about the war today?


348
0:22:0,119 --> 0:22:2,307
War? No?


349
0:22:2,307 --> 0:22:4,86
Sir, would you like to talk about the war?  - God bless.


350
0:22:4,86 --> 0:22:7,252
- No? The war? Please? The war?


351
0:22:7,252 --> 0:22:12,44
Anyone who would like to talk about the war?


352
0:22:12,44 --> 0:22:15,67
I am just sick of this, Peter. You're sending me on these assignments.


353
0:22:15,67 --> 0:22:18,16
It's freaking freezing out here!


354
0:22:18,16 --> 0:22:22,39
I'd rather be in a bar getting drunk and then maybe I can do this, all right?


355
0:22:22,39 --> 0:22:24,139
I think there's a bar up here.


356
0:22:24,139 --> 0:22:26,49
Let me just grab my shit.


357
0:22:26,49 --> 0:22:28,391
You know, I'm just sick of this.


358
0:22:28,391 --> 0:22:33,691
Goddammit!


359
0:22:33,691 --> 0:22:36,32
I said I am done, man! I am done!


360
0:22:36,32 --> 0:22:39,127
Get some other monkey, OK?


361
0:22:39,127 --> 0:22:41,929
There's trash and shit all over the place!


362
0:22:41,929 --> 0:22:45,3
What does Peter wants to know about? He wants to know about the war!


363
0:22:45,3 --> 0:22:48,56
Well, I am sick of it, man!


364
0:22:48,56 --> 0:22:51,811
I've got to calm down. I just need a drink.


365
0:22:51,811 --> 0:22:54,669
- Any of you are Occupy Wall Street types?


366
0:22:54,669 --> 0:22:56,608

We're so totally ruled by the 1%, which is basically all the corporations.


381
0:23:44,81 --> 0:23:47,993
wanting to sell us shit, influence us, influence our culture,


382
0:23:47,993 --> 0:23:50,56
so that we can't even think for ourselves and we're...


383
0:23:50,56 --> 0:23:53,89
our sense of self is altered and even our sense of health.


384
0:23:53,89 --> 0:23:58,72
I don't even fucking smoke! I don't know where this comes from? Jesus!


385
0:23:58,72 --> 0:24:2,289
Peter Joseph has asked us to stand out here in the freezing cold


386
0:24:2,289 --> 0:24:5,29
and talk about the difference of classes here, but


387
0:24:5,29 --> 0:24:8,58
he is sitting in his LA loft, relaxing


388
0:24:8,58 --> 0:24:28,335
with his big flat screen TV.


389
0:24:28,335 --> 0:24:36,4
New video message!


390
0:24:36,4 --> 0:24:38,683
- Yeah, fuck him!


391
0:24:38,683 --> 0:24:40,394
- Fuck Peter Joseph!


392
0:24:40,394 --> 0:24:45,179
The only thing that we don't have a war on, is a war on war,


393
0:24:45,179 --> 0:24:48,49
and I think that, as peace activists,we don't want to fight;


394
0:24:48,49 --> 0:24:54,35
so, we are going to end up loosing, due to irony!


395
0:24:54,35 --> 0:24:56,253
Final thoughts:


396
0:24:56,253 --> 0:25:0,432
How do we think about resolution of something as detrimental as national war,


397
0:25:0,432 --> 0:25:4,88
when, on the micro level, we in society actually praise, reward


398
0:25:4,88 --> 0:25:8,782
and reinforce the same basic underlying competitive drive?


399
0:25:8,782 --> 0:25:12,57
Generally, when faced with such a question, people tend to play the morality card,


400
0:25:12,57 --> 0:25:15,636
as though a matter of degree is what's relevant


401
0:25:15,636 --> 0:25:18,389
not the philosophical basis itself.


402
0:25:18,389 --> 0:25:22,236
Usually this vague distinction is gestured to the effect that


403
0:25:22,236 --> 0:25:27,505
competition is good, but we should never go too far and be violent in any way.


404
0:25:27,505 --> 0:25:32,51
Then, of course, the question becomes "What constitutes violence?"


405
0:25:32,51 --> 0:25:34,73
What if, instead of physically attacking you directly,


406
0:25:34,73 --> 0:25:37,902
I put you into a subtle yet deeply toxic condition,


407
0:25:37,902 --> 0:25:41,139
where your life is shorten by decades via heart disease, cancer,


408
0:25:41,139 --> 0:25:43,74
mental illness, and other such consequences.


409
0:25:43,74 --> 0:25:45,834
Would that be considered violent?


410
0:25:45,834 --> 0:25:49,24
And what if such intentions were not even directly malicious,


411
0:25:49,24 --> 0:25:52,325
such as a lower class, desperate single mother


412
0:25:52,325 --> 0:25:54,649
forced to work three jobs to keep up,


413
0:25:54,649 --> 0:25:58,7
who fails one night to provide proper supervision for her child,


414
0:25:58,7 --> 0:26:0,801
resulting in the death of her child?


415
0:26:0,801 --> 0:26:5,436
I ask you "What is the true origin of the resulting death,


416
0:26:5,436 --> 0:26:8,751
and does that qualify as violent?"


417
0:26:8,751 --> 0:26:11,47
To paraphrase Mahatma Gandhi


418
0:26:11,47 --> 0:26:14,646
"Poverty is the worst form of violence."


419
0:26:14,646 --> 0:26:18,54
You see, the real war going on is not as obvious as many think.


420
0:26:18,54 --> 0:26:23,212
The real war exists in the very structure of our society itself,


421
0:26:23,212 --> 0:26:25,786
something public health officials have now termed


422
0:26:25,786 --> 0:26:27,692
'Structural Violence':


423
0:26:27,692 --> 0:26:31,798
a war, in fact, against public health and balance itself,


424
0:26:31,798 --> 0:26:36,64
constantly producing casualty after casualty in its hidden oppression;


425
0:26:36,64 --> 0:26:39,809
and this form of violence today kills more people


426
0:26:39,809 --> 0:26:44,21
than every type of direct behavioral violence put together.


427
0:26:44,21 --> 0:26:46,259
Its origin? A social system


428
0:26:46,259 --> 0:26:50,996
literally built upon competition and exploitation itself


429
0:26:50,996 --> 0:26:53,838
So, for all you noble activists out there, for all of you


430
0:26:53,838 --> 0:26:57,647
who pile into protest zones each time a new national war emerges


431
0:26:57,647 --> 0:27:0,64
and yell at the top of your lungs, keep in mind,


432
0:27:0,64 --> 0:27:5,437
that you are only targeting a symptom of a larger sociological problem


433
0:27:5,437 --> 0:27:9,29
and until the activist community realizes this, I am sorry to say:


434
0:27:9,29 --> 0:27:12,143
your protests have no long-term consequence,


435
0:27:12,143 --> 0:27:15,341
as they do not address the root problem.


436
0:27:15,341 --> 0:27:19,559
But, on the bright side, it's still great entertainment, right?


437
0:27:19,559 --> 0:27:22,9
so let's keep watching this bizarre human experiment,


438
0:27:22,9 --> 0:27:25,912
certainly the greatest, yet worst reality show of all time, for sure.


439
0:27:25,912 --> 0:27:28,879
I am Peter Joseph, and yes I, like you,


440
0:27:28,879 --> 0:27:35,69
am an agent and victim of a culture in decline.


441
0:27:35,69 --> 0:27:37,959
Where is the credit scene?


442
0:27:37,959 --> 0:27:44,63
What? What do you mean "Bob didn't get hurt"?


443
0:27:44,63 --> 0:27:46,452
I'm sorry, Bob.


444
0:27:46,452 --> 0:27:51,123
It's the format of the show.


445
0:27:51,123 --> 0:27:54,665
"Neither the great political and financial power structures of the world,


446
0:27:54,665 --> 0:27:58,261
nor the specialization-blinded professionals nor the population in general


447
0:27:58,261 --> 0:28:1,887
realizes that... it is now highly feasible to take care of everyone on earth


448
0:28:1,887 --> 0:28:4,781
at a higher standard of living than they have ever known.


449
0:28:4,781 --> 0:28:7,79
It no longer has to be you or me. Selfishness is unnecessary


450
0:28:7,79 --> 0:28:10,682
and henceforth unrationalizable as mandated by survival.


451
0:28:10,682 --> 0:28:20,326
War is obsolete." - R. Buckminster Fuller


452
0:28:20,326 --> 0:28:26,377
Written and edited by Peter Joseph while severely constipated


453
0:28:26,377 --> 0:28:44,84
Culture in Decline


454
0:28:44,84 --> 0:28:49,1
What if what I'm about to tell you makes you question 'what is what'?


455
0:28:49,1 --> 0:28:52,137
What if I propose a 'what if' scenario?


456
0:28:52,137 --> 0:28:55,294
What if I were to take up precious time in your busy life


457
0:28:55,294 --> 0:28:59,818
just spinning you on a soul-dulling spiral with meaningless double-talk?


458
0:28:59,818 --> 0:29:4,8
But at the same time, what if I kept you distracted with flashy graphics?


459
0:29:4,8 --> 0:29:7,429
Would you notice? Or for that matter, would you care?


460
0:29:7,429 --> 0:29:12,269
Naah. You're too busy, listening to some guy in a tie.


461
0:29:12,269 --> 0:31:12,269
And sleep. (Snap!)
