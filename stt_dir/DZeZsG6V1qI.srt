0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:13,446



2
0:0:13,446 --> 0:0:15,65
FRED GALL: See, if I brought
some dudes to this, they'd be


3
0:0:15,65 --> 0:0:18,864
like, are you fucking
serious, man?


4
0:0:18,864 --> 0:0:20,67
I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to rig this one.


5
0:0:20,67 --> 0:0:21,92
I'll try, though.


6
0:0:21,92 --> 0:0:29,58



7
0:0:29,58 --> 0:0:31,12
Fuck it, let's move on.


8
0:0:31,12 --> 0:0:32,63
That's good enough, right?


9
0:0:32,63 --> 0:0:32,85
PATRICK O'DELL: Hi.


10
0:0:32,85 --> 0:0:34,88
Welcome back to the Epically
Later'd show.


11
0:0:34,88 --> 0:0:40,74
This episode, I went out to
Jersey, met up with Fred Gall.


12
0:0:40,74 --> 0:0:41,51
He took me around.


13
0:0:41,51 --> 0:0:45,5
We looked at spots, incredibly
crappy spots that you gotta


14
0:0:45,5 --> 0:0:47,29
skate if you're from New Jersey
or if you're from the


15
0:0:47,29 --> 0:0:49,9
East Coast.


16
0:0:49,9 --> 0:0:51,51
I think Fred brought something
refreshing to


17
0:0:51,51 --> 0:0:53,41
skating in the mid-'90s.


18
0:0:53,41 --> 0:0:56,44
Those Eastern Exposure videos
were just guys hauling ass


19
0:0:56,44 --> 0:0:59,35
down the street, skating
switch--


20
0:0:59,35 --> 0:1:2,58
you know, pole jams and late
shove-its and stuff.


21
0:1:2,58 --> 0:1:3,46
[CHEERING]


22
0:1:3,46 --> 0:1:4,28
PATRICK O'DELL: That's it.


23
0:1:4,28 --> 0:1:7,495
This is a day in the life
with Freddy Gall.


24
0:1:7,495 --> 0:1:8,47
FRED GALL: So what's up, man?


25
0:1:8,47 --> 0:1:9,86
Check it out.


26
0:1:9,86 --> 0:1:12,21
You know, usually all these pro
skaters, they got their


27
0:1:12,21 --> 0:1:13,77
hot rides and shit.


28
0:1:13,77 --> 0:1:16,86
Well, I rock my grandmother's
station wagon, man.


29
0:1:16,86 --> 0:1:19,34
Love this car.


30
0:1:19,34 --> 0:1:20,836
I learned to ollie in this
driveway, actually.


31
0:1:20,836 --> 0:1:22,39
I'll show you.


32
0:1:22,39 --> 0:1:26,2
I have a parking block that we
stole when I was 10 years old,


33
0:1:26,2 --> 0:1:27,2
and it's still there.


34
0:1:27,2 --> 0:1:29,9
It's been in my grandmother's
driveway for 18 years.


35
0:1:29,9 --> 0:1:32,27
PATRICK O'DELL: You're still
the skate whiz to her?


36
0:1:32,27 --> 0:1:33,31
FRED GALL: Yeah.


37
0:1:33,31 --> 0:1:36,7
28-year-old skate whiz.


38
0:1:36,7 --> 0:1:39,22
We'll go meet her right now.


39
0:1:39,22 --> 0:1:41,56
Hello.


40
0:1:41,56 --> 0:1:42,6
Hi.


41
0:1:42,6 --> 0:1:44,95
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh.


42
0:1:44,95 --> 0:1:45,819
Not me.


43
0:1:45,819 --> 0:1:47,905
FRED GALL: Well, now
it's a flower--


44
0:1:47,905 --> 0:1:51,7



45
0:1:51,7 --> 0:1:51,68
FRED GALL: It's all right.


46
0:1:51,68 --> 0:1:52,52
I'm just showing them.


47
0:1:52,52 --> 0:1:57,2
Yeah, this has been here
for 18 years now.


48
0:1:57,2 --> 0:1:58,37
Used to slide good.


49
0:1:58,37 --> 0:2:1,346
I don't know, it doesn't
look like it anymore.


50
0:2:1,346 --> 0:2:2,67
No complies and stuff.


51
0:2:2,67 --> 0:2:5,334
It's pretty funny.


52
0:2:5,334 --> 0:2:7,88
FEMALE SPEAKER: He had
a ramp right there.


53
0:2:7,88 --> 0:2:13,31
And he would skate all day,
all night, clunking away.


54
0:2:13,31 --> 0:2:15,46
And of course, I took him
to all the stores


55
0:2:15,46 --> 0:2:17,65
to get him his clothes.


56
0:2:17,65 --> 0:2:24,51
You see, I don't understand
his profession.


57
0:2:24,51 --> 0:2:26,79
I don't understand it.


58
0:2:26,79 --> 0:2:28,84
And when he'd say, look it,
I'm getting a sponsor.


59
0:2:28,84 --> 0:2:32,95
Look at my picture in a
magazine, or on the boards and


60
0:2:32,95 --> 0:2:34,216
the sneakers.


61
0:2:34,216 --> 0:2:35,4
I couldn't comprehend.


62
0:2:35,4 --> 0:2:38,61
How could this all happen?


63
0:2:38,61 --> 0:2:40,56
FRED GALL: This is my
first board graphic.


64
0:2:40,56 --> 0:2:42,67
Neil Blender drew it on,
like, a napkin or


65
0:2:42,67 --> 0:2:44,3
something like that.


66
0:2:44,3 --> 0:2:45,548
And I was pretty hyped.


67
0:2:45,548 --> 0:2:47,738
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we're
very proud of him.


68
0:2:47,738 --> 0:2:50,811
Except get a job, Fred.


69
0:2:50,811 --> 0:2:53,78
Yeah, we all care
and love Freddy.


70
0:2:53,78 --> 0:2:55,61
He can do no wrong in my eyes.


71
0:2:55,61 --> 0:2:56,76
I'll tell you that.


72
0:2:56,76 --> 0:3:0,2
You can lambast him once
in a while, but--


73
0:3:0,2 --> 0:3:0,705
PATRICK O'DELL: What
do you mean?


74
0:3:0,705 --> 0:3:0,98
FEMALE SPEAKER: Huh?


75
0:3:0,98 --> 0:3:3,15
PATRICK O'DELL: What do
you mean, lambasted?


76
0:3:3,15 --> 0:3:4,52
FEMALE SPEAKER: Lambasting.


77
0:3:4,52 --> 0:3:5,24
PATRICK O'DELL: What
does that--


78
0:3:5,24 --> 0:3:7,96
FEMALE SPEAKER: Just slapping
him, you know.


79
0:3:7,96 --> 0:3:11,98
JAKE PHELPS: Oh, I would say
Frank the Tank, that's '94.


80
0:3:11,98 --> 0:3:14,54
Switch 5-0 hubba hideout
on the cover.


81
0:3:14,54 --> 0:3:17,935
I think he came out here and
he pretty much blew it out.


82
0:3:17,935 --> 0:3:19,65
I think it was in the
Eastern Exposure


83
0:3:19,65 --> 0:3:23,22
vid, he did some shit--


84
0:3:23,22 --> 0:3:24,54
Freddy, he's a really
good skater.


85
0:3:24,54 --> 0:3:27,33
He still is a great skater.


86
0:3:27,33 --> 0:3:28,49
And he went for it.


87
0:3:28,49 --> 0:3:30,98
I could see this look on his
face that he genuinely had the


88
0:3:30,98 --> 0:3:34,21
same stoke that he had when he
was a little kid when he first


89
0:3:34,21 --> 0:3:35,84
bombed a hill on his driveway.


90
0:3:35,84 --> 0:3:36,99
DAEWON SONG: He's been
around for a while.


91
0:3:36,99 --> 0:3:39,84
He's one person you can
say paid his dues.


92
0:3:39,84 --> 0:3:42,64
Eastern Exposure videos,
all that stuff, yeah.


93
0:3:42,64 --> 0:3:44,1
He's one of the guys.


94
0:3:44,1 --> 0:3:44,9
He's more raw.


95
0:3:44,9 --> 0:3:46,66
He's kind of like
a Ricky Oyola.


96
0:3:46,66 --> 0:3:49,262
There's so many different types
of skating nowadays that


97
0:3:49,262 --> 0:3:52,3
it's good you got those
guys around.


98
0:3:52,3 --> 0:3:53,75
FRED GALL: I mean, I watch them
till this day, and they


99
0:3:53,75 --> 0:3:57,85
get my psyched to go
skate and whatnot.


100
0:3:57,85 --> 0:3:59,81
It's just a good
vibe and that.


101
0:3:59,81 --> 0:4:2,33
It's like, we never really
had a legit filmer.


102
0:4:2,33 --> 0:4:5,97
Dan was the first dude
to come and film.


103
0:4:5,97 --> 0:4:8,31
And we'd be so psyched, because
it was so clean and


104
0:4:8,31 --> 0:4:11,49
looked so legit that that's
what actually got us real


105
0:4:11,49 --> 0:4:15,37
hyped on film, was his style of
filming and him being down


106
0:4:15,37 --> 0:4:19,47
to just come down to Philly all
the time and just film.


107
0:4:19,47 --> 0:4:21,42
Other than that, we would
just film each other


108
0:4:21,42 --> 0:4:23,33
with whoever's camera.


109
0:4:23,33 --> 0:4:26,2
Back then, it was just like
everything was new, so you


110
0:4:26,2 --> 0:4:27,25
could just do whatever.


111
0:4:27,25 --> 0:4:30,4
And it was all tricks
no one had done.


112
0:4:30,4 --> 0:4:34,6
I mean, now I'll go out and
fucking pull my hair out


113
0:4:34,6 --> 0:4:37,585
sometimes trying to film video
parts, because you gotta keep


114
0:4:37,585 --> 0:4:38,835
it up to par.


115
0:4:38,835 --> 0:4:44,5



116
0:4:44,5 --> 0:4:46,49
PATRICK O'DELL: You think
there's some way in that all


117
0:4:46,49 --> 0:4:48,49
the Jersey skaters
are similar?


118
0:4:48,49 --> 0:4:49,4
FRED GALL: Yeah, definitely.


119
0:4:49,4 --> 0:4:52,14
I mean, people who grow up in
Cali and they got all the


120
0:4:52,14 --> 0:4:54,64
perfect ground at the schools
and stuff-- like, we're used


121
0:4:54,64 --> 0:4:56,58
to skating shitty spots.


122
0:4:56,58 --> 0:4:58,1
They always look
great on film.


123
0:4:58,1 --> 0:5:0,27
They always look cool and
definitely different.


124
0:5:0,27 --> 0:5:5,52



125
0:5:5,52 --> 0:5:6,68
MALE SPEAKER: Damn.


126
0:5:6,68 --> 0:5:8,355
FRED GALL: I bring people
to some spots and


127
0:5:8,355 --> 0:5:8,89
they hate them, man.


128
0:5:8,89 --> 0:5:11,76
And they're just like, how the
fuck do you skate this shit?


129
0:5:11,76 --> 0:5:13,476
I don't know, I like
that shit.


130
0:5:13,476 --> 0:5:16,88



131
0:5:16,88 --> 0:5:20,16
We would skate New York City
a lot before Newark.


132
0:5:20,16 --> 0:5:21,925
I mean, because it's
always real ghetto.


133
0:5:21,925 --> 0:5:24,88
But just search it out, and
there's definitely spots.


134
0:5:24,88 --> 0:5:30,677



135
0:5:30,677 --> 0:5:31,68
Check it out.


136
0:5:31,68 --> 0:5:33,25
Up here's--


137
0:5:33,25 --> 0:5:35,91
this is Seth Boyden,
some of the most


138
0:5:35,91 --> 0:5:37,85
dangerous projects in Newark.


139
0:5:37,85 --> 0:5:39,35
It'll be up here on the right.


140
0:5:39,35 --> 0:5:40,12
Yeah I wouldn't--


141
0:5:40,12 --> 0:5:40,46
I don't know.


142
0:5:40,46 --> 0:5:41,8
If there was a spot in there--


143
0:5:41,8 --> 0:5:43,58
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].


144
0:5:43,58 --> 0:5:45,5
FRED GALL: --I'd probably
go skate it.


145
0:5:45,5 --> 0:5:48,81
I've definitely put myself into
bad situations before.


146
0:5:48,81 --> 0:5:54,485
I actually got robbed in Albany
a couple months back.


147
0:5:54,485 --> 0:5:56,55
I got fucking hit in the face.


148
0:5:56,55 --> 0:5:58,28
I don't know what he hit me
with, but it wasn't no fist


149
0:5:58,28 --> 0:6:2,34
because it fucking broke my
sinus cavity right here, and


150
0:6:2,34 --> 0:6:4,93
fractured this cheek bone.


151
0:6:4,93 --> 0:6:5,59
PATRICK O'DELL: So how old
were you when you were


152
0:6:5,59 --> 0:6:8,58
skating, first starting to
go to New York City?


153
0:6:8,58 --> 0:6:10,9
FRED GALL: Like, 11 years
old, I think.


154
0:6:10,9 --> 0:6:13,27
It was in my first
banks contest.


155
0:6:13,27 --> 0:6:14,95
And my mom used to bring
me and shit.


156
0:6:14,95 --> 0:6:16,21
She would pull the
car right up.


157
0:6:16,21 --> 0:6:18,19
That's when the banks were like,
you could do anything.


158
0:6:18,19 --> 0:6:20,23
Just park at the banks.


159
0:6:20,23 --> 0:6:22,41
My mom would drink tall
cans of beer while


160
0:6:22,41 --> 0:6:24,27
I skated all day.


161
0:6:24,27 --> 0:6:27,65
My mom made me this shirt.


162
0:6:27,65 --> 0:6:29,57
And it's--


163
0:6:29,57 --> 0:6:32,6
what was going to be my-- it was
a joking graphic, but she


164
0:6:32,6 --> 0:6:35,67
just drew kicking down
the Twin Towers.


165
0:6:35,67 --> 0:6:37,69
And now look what
happened now.


166
0:6:37,69 --> 0:6:38,645
They really fell down.


167
0:6:38,645 --> 0:6:40,65
It's fucked up.


168
0:6:40,65 --> 0:6:42,55
It's kind of spooky, man.


169
0:6:42,55 --> 0:6:43,99
This was given to me, dude.


170
0:6:43,99 --> 0:6:45,84
I went to my friend's house.


171
0:6:45,84 --> 0:6:47,57
He's like, yeah, I got
a Hosoi board.


172
0:6:47,57 --> 0:6:49,79
I'm like, you gotta be
fucking kidding me.


173
0:6:49,79 --> 0:6:51,605
You got a original
Hosoi board?


174
0:6:51,605 --> 0:6:53,23
He's like, here, you
can have it.


175
0:6:53,23 --> 0:6:56,7
I was like, thank you
so much, dude.


176
0:6:56,7 --> 0:6:57,766
What can I give to you?


177
0:6:57,766 --> 0:7:0,245
PATRICK O'DELL: Do you have any
boards that you've skated,


178
0:7:0,245 --> 0:7:2,3
like, old boards that--


179
0:7:2,3 --> 0:7:4,1
FRED GALL: See, you could ask my
grandmother about that one,


180
0:7:4,1 --> 0:7:7,64
because my basement used to be
stacked up with Alva boards,


181
0:7:7,64 --> 0:7:9,94
every single board
I had in my life.


182
0:7:9,94 --> 0:7:11,89
And she likes to throw
things out.


183
0:7:11,89 --> 0:7:13,915
And I came over one day
and they were gone.


184
0:7:13,915 --> 0:7:15,49
And I go, no, you didn't.


185
0:7:15,49 --> 0:7:16,61
Please tell me you didn't.


186
0:7:16,61 --> 0:7:21,462
Yeah, she threw, like,
50 boards away.


187
0:7:21,462 --> 0:7:24,59
PATRICK O'DELL: He seems like
he's had comebacks over and


188
0:7:24,59 --> 0:7:26,66
over, like he's one of
those people that--


189
0:7:26,66 --> 0:7:27,44
JAKE PHELPS: Well, I
think that he can


190
0:7:27,44 --> 0:7:28,33
do whatever he wants.


191
0:7:28,33 --> 0:7:30,322
I mean, a lot of skaters
are like that.


192
0:7:30,322 --> 0:7:33,88
I mean, just because someone's
not doing something-- do you


193
0:7:33,88 --> 0:7:36,4
think Heath and Fowler can't
still fucking ollie over your


194
0:7:36,4 --> 0:7:37,46
fucking car?


195
0:7:37,46 --> 0:7:40,26
Do you think Julian
still bombs hills?


196
0:7:40,26 --> 0:7:42,615
Yeah, probably.


197
0:7:42,615 --> 0:7:45,6
FRED GALL: This is my
backyard, basically.


198
0:7:45,6 --> 0:7:48,48
Grew up hitching trains over
here, painting them, whatever.


199
0:7:48,48 --> 0:7:50,46
The freight yard's there,
so it's like a


200
0:7:50,46 --> 0:7:51,71
playground back here.


201
0:7:51,71 --> 0:7:54,414



202
0:7:54,414 --> 0:7:58,5
I don't know if you should put
the weed part in, but you can


203
0:7:58,5 --> 0:7:59,75
film it anyway.


204
0:7:59,75 --> 0:8:3,585



205
0:8:3,585 --> 0:8:5,48
Because Granny's gonna
wanna watch it.


206
0:8:5,48 --> 0:8:10,79



207
0:8:10,79 --> 0:8:14,34
I mean, I've taken them far as
hell this way, but I've gotten


208
0:8:14,34 --> 0:8:18,25
really worked as a kid holding
on to the back.


209
0:8:18,25 --> 0:8:20,503
And it really starts hauling
ass, and you gotta jump off on


210
0:8:20,503 --> 0:8:21,916
to this shit.


211
0:8:21,916 --> 0:8:22,77
I don't know, man.


212
0:8:22,77 --> 0:8:25,56
I got severely worked,
and I didn't do


213
0:8:25,56 --> 0:8:27,1
it for a while again.


214
0:8:27,1 --> 0:8:29,82
Just land and just cut
up everywhere.


215
0:8:29,82 --> 0:10:29,82
