1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:11,33



2
0:0:11,33 --> 0:0:13,44
ERNIE QUINTERO: Hey guys, this
is Ernie reporting for VBS


3
0:0:13,44 --> 0:0:15,26
from Imperial Valley.


4
0:0:15,26 --> 0:0:18,15
In the toxic piece, we focused
on all the crazy environmental


5
0:0:18,15 --> 0:0:21,23
issues going on in the region,
from the air pollution, to


6
0:0:21,23 --> 0:0:23,84
drastic bee die-off, to the
sewage-filled rivers, and


7
0:0:23,84 --> 0:0:25,33
everything in between.


8
0:0:25,33 --> 0:0:27,9
But during the shoot, we also
met a bevy of characters from


9
0:0:27,9 --> 0:0:29,96
our buddy Alan's town in Slab
City, who are just as


10
0:0:29,96 --> 0:0:31,425
intriguing as all the
eco-problems.


11
0:0:31,425 --> 0:0:33,58
MALE SPEAKER 1: Well, have
you been out to Slabs?


12
0:0:33,58 --> 0:0:34,83
MALE SPEAKER 2: It's the
last free place--


13
0:0:34,83 --> 0:0:37,25
MALE SPEAKER 1: Free place
in America, yeah.


14
0:0:37,25 --> 0:0:37,815
MALE SPEAKER 3: It's
isolation.


15
0:0:37,815 --> 0:0:40,1
It's desolation.


16
0:0:40,1 --> 0:0:43,18
It's not involved with
the popular culture.


17
0:0:43,18 --> 0:0:44,91
MALE SPEAKER 4: Everything
here is hostile.


18
0:0:44,91 --> 0:0:46,24
The desert doesn't give
you anything.


19
0:0:46,24 --> 0:0:49,382
It's treachery, and
it takes away.


20
0:0:49,382 --> 0:0:51,47
You have to know what you're
doing if you're going to


21
0:0:51,47 --> 0:0:54,7
survive in the desert,
or you'll die.


22
0:0:54,7 --> 0:0:55,85
ERNIE QUINTERO: We thought it'd
fun to show you what a


23
0:0:55,85 --> 0:0:59,11
typical day is like this bizarre
stretch of area loaded


24
0:0:59,11 --> 0:1:2,24
with tweakers, eccentrics, army
vets, hippies, and just


25
0:1:2,24 --> 0:1:4,69
plain old fucking weirdos.


26
0:1:4,69 --> 0:1:5,94
MALE SPEAKER 5: Oh, welcome
to California.


27
0:1:5,94 --> 0:1:9,22



28
0:1:9,22 --> 0:1:10,62
ERNIE QUINTERO: We're
about to head in to


29
0:1:10,62 --> 0:1:12,24
Slab City right now.


30
0:1:12,24 --> 0:1:14,2
The people there are really
cool, but they really like if


31
0:1:14,2 --> 0:1:15,65
you bring them beer--


32
0:1:15,65 --> 0:1:17,65
beer and smokes.


33
0:1:17,65 --> 0:1:20,75
They like to party.


34
0:1:20,75 --> 0:1:23,335
I like to party too, so
it goes hand in hand.


35
0:1:23,335 --> 0:1:38,11



36
0:1:38,11 --> 0:1:40,375
MALE SPEAKER 3: It was
originally designed by NASCAR


37
0:1:40,375 --> 0:1:43,15
for use in the pits and
the garage areas.


38
0:1:43,15 --> 0:1:46,76
But it's eminently suitable
to the environment out


39
0:1:46,76 --> 0:1:47,66
here in Slab City.


40
0:1:47,66 --> 0:1:49,97
So I just had to have one.


41
0:1:49,97 --> 0:1:54,26
It's called a Cruzin Cooler I
bought it from one of those


42
0:1:54,26 --> 0:1:56,437
outfitter's catalogs.


43
0:1:56,437 --> 0:1:57,391
ERNIE QUINTERO: [LAUGH]


44
0:1:57,391 --> 0:2:0,75
Hey, can we take that into
Niland, get some more beer?


45
0:2:0,75 --> 0:2:1,902
MALE SPEAKER 3: Ernie,
settle down.


46
0:2:1,902 --> 0:2:11,542
ERNIE QUINTERO: [LAUGH]


47
0:2:11,542 --> 0:2:12,96
MALE SPEAKER 3: Us Americans,
we now how to


48
0:2:12,96 --> 0:2:14,21
design top-shelf stuff.


49
0:2:14,21 --> 0:2:17,9



50
0:2:17,9 --> 0:2:19,895
People have been living here for
free since the late '40s.


51
0:2:19,895 --> 0:2:23,51
And at one time in the early
'90s, the place was like a


52
0:2:23,51 --> 0:2:25,55
giant flea market.


53
0:2:25,55 --> 0:2:28,9
Believe or not, this land
belongs to the California


54
0:2:28,9 --> 0:2:34,37
State Teachers' Retirement
Pension Fund Management


55
0:2:34,37 --> 0:2:35,565
Association.


56
0:2:35,565 --> 0:2:38,3
Now that's a long acronym.


57
0:2:38,3 --> 0:2:38,685
Yeah.


58
0:2:38,685 --> 0:2:41,792
It belongs to the state of
California teachers union.


59
0:2:41,792 --> 0:2:44,52
It should make you feel all warm
and fuzzy inside knowing


60
0:2:44,52 --> 0:2:48,45
that your tax dollars are being
spent appropriately.


61
0:2:48,45 --> 0:2:50,21
Culturally, this is
the farthest.


62
0:2:50,21 --> 0:2:52,862
If anybody's ever been to
California and then go to Slab


63
0:2:52,862 --> 0:2:53,79
City, they'll understand
exactly


64
0:2:53,79 --> 0:2:55,27
what I'm talking about.


65
0:2:55,27 --> 0:3:0,36
There is no California
culture here at all.


66
0:3:0,36 --> 0:3:4,18
And by that I mean strip malls
and apartment buildings and


67
0:3:4,18 --> 0:3:10,17
dune buggies and off-road racing
and crowded freeways


68
0:3:10,17 --> 0:3:16,27
and filthy beaches and
arrogant politicians.


69
0:3:16,27 --> 0:3:20,48
I like to call Slab City
a high-tech hobo camp.


70
0:3:20,48 --> 0:3:23,78
You look in this little window
here, and you can see that the


71
0:3:23,78 --> 0:3:25,23
flame is burning.


72
0:3:25,23 --> 0:3:28,4
That way you know it's on.


73
0:3:28,4 --> 0:3:30,921
You open it up and
reach in here.


74
0:3:30,921 --> 0:3:34,56
And you can feel this thing
starting to get cold.


75
0:3:34,56 --> 0:3:36,39
I just replaced the propane
this morning,


76
0:3:36,39 --> 0:3:37,64
so it takes a while.


77
0:3:37,64 --> 0:3:39,9



78
0:3:39,9 --> 0:3:43,52
Then I use these other little
propane bottles to run my


79
0:3:43,52 --> 0:3:45,7
heaters and my lanterns
and stuff.


80
0:3:45,7 --> 0:3:46,71
And I fill them up
off of that tank.


81
0:3:46,71 --> 0:3:49,94



82
0:3:49,94 --> 0:3:54,7
So I have two of those and a
bunch of those little green


83
0:3:54,7 --> 0:3:56,3
ones, and that's about
all I need.


84
0:3:56,3 --> 0:4:0,5



85
0:4:0,5 --> 0:4:1,8
Slab City has the same
cross-section that you would


86
0:4:1,8 --> 0:4:4,92
find in any so-called
civilization.


87
0:4:4,92 --> 0:4:8,39
You've got really cool people,
you've got dumbasses, and


88
0:4:8,39 --> 0:4:10,11
you've got all those
in between.


89
0:4:10,11 --> 0:4:13,7
We're no different from any
other outfit that way.


90
0:4:13,7 --> 0:4:20,329
We just have fewer people and we
have a general consensus to


91
0:4:20,329 --> 0:4:25,34
live and let live, and to let
each other alone, and to mind


92
0:4:25,34 --> 0:4:27,41
their own business.


93
0:4:27,41 --> 0:4:30,46
There's a lot of people that
certainly have seniority, that


94
0:4:30,46 --> 0:4:33,2
have been here for
very long time.


95
0:4:33,2 --> 0:4:37,32
But what we try to do is, we try
to avoid things like that.


96
0:4:37,32 --> 0:4:41,79
We try harder to be polite,
perhaps, than,


97
0:4:41,79 --> 0:4:45,576
say, New York City.


98
0:4:45,576 --> 0:4:48,41
Something like that.


99
0:4:48,41 --> 0:4:50,32
I moved out here because
I like it.


100
0:4:50,32 --> 0:4:59,801



101
0:4:59,801 --> 0:5:12,276
MALE SPEAKER 4: Ooh, ooh,
ooh, ahh, ahh, ahh.


102
0:5:12,276 --> 0:5:13,773
[LAUGH]


103
0:5:13,773 --> 0:5:16,268
He's a good boy.


104
0:5:16,268 --> 0:5:18,23
And relax.


105
0:5:18,23 --> 0:5:19,74
Remember, you're amongst
friends.


106
0:5:19,74 --> 0:5:22,26
This is a Western Diamondback.


107
0:5:22,26 --> 0:5:27,2
It is a neurotoxic, more
than hemotoxic snake.


108
0:5:27,2 --> 0:5:29,2
And it kills more people in
the United States than any


109
0:5:29,2 --> 0:5:30,27
other reptile.


110
0:5:30,27 --> 0:5:33,31



111
0:5:33,31 --> 0:5:36,5
Up north, you'll see snakes,
they have black


112
0:5:36,5 --> 0:5:38,26
splotches on here.


113
0:5:38,26 --> 0:5:41,225
This is part of what I'm
trying to tell you.


114
0:5:41,225 --> 0:5:43,35
If you go up north, and there's
a snake, and he's


115
0:5:43,35 --> 0:5:46,61
green, and this is red, and
there's yellow borders, it's a


116
0:5:46,61 --> 0:5:47,76
Mojave Green.


117
0:5:47,76 --> 0:5:51,332
There's a 70% chance you're
going to die if you get bit.


118
0:5:51,332 --> 0:5:53,51
I think it's 7 people
out of 10--


119
0:5:53,51 --> 0:5:54,74
I mean, you're lucky
if you live.


120
0:5:54,74 --> 0:5:55,5
Because it goes right in.


121
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:56,19
It shuts you off.


122
0:5:56,19 --> 0:5:57,26
It's neurotoxic.


123
0:5:57,26 --> 0:5:58,43
It doesn't make a big bite.


124
0:5:58,43 --> 0:5:59,66
You don't think much of it.


125
0:5:59,66 --> 0:6:1,25
But it goes in there.


126
0:6:1,25 --> 0:6:1,57
And it's death.


127
0:6:1,57 --> 0:6:3,5
He's in there shutting
you off.


128
0:6:3,5 --> 0:6:4,36
I wouldn't wish it on
my worst enemy.


129
0:6:4,36 --> 0:6:7,195
If I hated your guts, I wouldn't
wish that kind of


130
0:6:7,195 --> 0:6:7,635
death on you.


131
0:6:7,635 --> 0:6:9,23
If I was trying to extract
information from you or


132
0:6:9,23 --> 0:6:11,2
something, I might use
a snake-- just that


133
0:6:11,2 --> 0:6:12,63
psychological part.


134
0:6:12,63 --> 0:6:13,95
You know, like, where
are the children?


135
0:6:13,95 --> 0:6:15,51
Where'd you hide them?


136
0:6:15,51 --> 0:6:17,61
I'll get the information
from you.


137
0:6:17,61 --> 0:6:18,72
Use your fears on you
or something.


138
0:6:18,72 --> 0:6:19,75
But I wouldn't wish
it on someone.


139
0:6:19,75 --> 0:6:21,74
It'd have to be real serious.


140
0:6:21,74 --> 0:6:23,6
I was just one of those little
kids, and my mom wouldn't let


141
0:6:23,6 --> 0:6:24,89
me have rattlesnakes.


142
0:6:24,89 --> 0:6:27,28
And then what happens, after
getting bit and being through


143
0:6:27,28 --> 0:6:30,26
all the hospitals and things,
I learned to catch them and


144
0:6:30,26 --> 0:6:32,27
get them out of people's yards
so people don't get hurt.


145
0:6:32,27 --> 0:6:34,61
So I can use the talent I
learned from a lot of pain


146
0:6:34,61 --> 0:6:37,77
that I wouldn't wish on my worst
enemy for catching them


147
0:6:37,77 --> 0:6:38,99
and getting them out
of the yard.


148
0:6:38,99 --> 0:6:41,352
And then I take them up
a mile or two away.


149
0:6:41,352 --> 0:6:43,6
See these bombs?


150
0:6:43,6 --> 0:6:44,47
See those bombs exploded?


151
0:6:44,47 --> 0:6:44,91
Look at them.


152
0:6:44,91 --> 0:6:46,24
If I get bombs, I take them.


153
0:6:46,24 --> 0:6:47,965
And I call the fire chief.


154
0:6:47,965 --> 0:6:52,34
We get a hold of somebody If we
can't handle it ourselves


155
0:6:52,34 --> 0:6:54,36
and ask them to come
and blow them up.


156
0:6:54,36 --> 0:6:56,35
Because there's a marine base
out here, and sometimes people


157
0:6:56,35 --> 0:6:56,98
go over to get bombs.


158
0:6:56,98 --> 0:6:58,71
And sometimes bombs
are over here.


159
0:6:58,71 --> 0:7:0,62
So what I'm saying is, this
rattlesnake is just like one


160
0:7:0,62 --> 0:7:1,76
of those bombs.


161
0:7:1,76 --> 0:7:3,94
It's like a bomb right there
ready to go off.


162
0:7:3,94 --> 0:7:6,8
It can make you into
a casualty.


163
0:7:6,8 --> 0:7:9,66
So what I'm saying is, those
aren't some kind of toy.


164
0:7:9,66 --> 0:7:12,5
Those are just like a hand
grenade that somebody lobbed


165
0:7:12,5 --> 0:7:14,94
in the window, a landmine that
you're about ready to step on.


166
0:7:14,94 --> 0:7:16,64
ERNIE QUINTERO: Well, you are
doing a good thing capturing


167
0:7:16,64 --> 0:7:18,28
snakes so little kids don't
get bit by them.


168
0:7:18,28 --> 0:7:20,102
I think that's an
awesome thing.


169
0:7:20,102 --> 0:7:21,44
MALE SPEAKER 4: I don't have
no sympathy for these.


170
0:7:21,44 --> 0:7:23,94
All this is, is an
hors d'oeuvres.


171
0:7:23,94 --> 0:7:25,7
When it gets right down
it, and I'm starving.


172
0:7:25,7 --> 0:7:27,62
And I'm dying, and I'm
trying to survive.


173
0:7:27,62 --> 0:7:29,48
And I'm trying to get through
because my foot's got a hole


174
0:7:29,48 --> 0:7:30,3
in it or something.


175
0:7:30,3 --> 0:7:31,126
And I've got to crawl.


176
0:7:31,126 --> 0:7:32,344
I'm going to eat this
son of a bitch.


177
0:7:32,344 --> 0:7:34,784
And I'm going to crawl
over and eat the


178
0:7:34,784 --> 0:7:36,2
man's butt, not yours.


179
0:7:36,2 --> 0:7:37,98
Because a man's butt's
got more meat to it.


180
0:7:37,98 --> 0:7:38,79
Chop off half of it.


181
0:7:38,79 --> 0:7:39,76
And eat it and crawl
down the road.


182
0:7:39,76 --> 0:7:42,23
And eat that dog's butt if he'll
let me get away with it.


183
0:7:42,23 --> 0:7:46,844
You know, survival, that's
what I mean.


184
0:7:46,844 --> 0:7:51,784
[LAUGH]


185
0:7:51,784 --> 0:7:58,206



186
0:7:58,206 --> 0:8:1,18
ALAN: This is the back side
of Slab City right here.


187
0:8:1,18 --> 0:8:6,63
And it is home to a
lot of older folk.


188
0:8:6,63 --> 0:8:11,62
I like coming out here because
it's like good scenic route.


189
0:8:11,62 --> 0:8:13,15
How you doing there, guy?


190
0:8:13,15 --> 0:8:13,4
MALE SPEAKER 6: Hello.


191
0:8:13,4 --> 0:8:14,14
ALAN: Are you far from moving?


192
0:8:14,14 --> 0:8:15,39
MALE SPEAKER 6: [INAUDIBLE],
yeah.


193
0:8:15,39 --> 0:8:17,6



194
0:8:17,6 --> 0:8:18,85
ALAN: How are you doing
there, my friend?


195
0:8:18,85 --> 0:8:22,1



196
0:8:22,1 --> 0:8:23,74
ALAN: It's mine.


197
0:8:23,74 --> 0:8:26,18
I traded my bus in,
and I got this.


198
0:8:26,18 --> 0:8:30,67



199
0:8:30,67 --> 0:8:32,44
ALAN: I just wanted to let you
know that we've been playing a


200
0:8:32,44 --> 0:8:33,539
lot of music over there.


201
0:8:33,539 --> 0:8:34,14
MALE SPEAKER 6: Oh yes?


202
0:8:34,14 --> 0:8:35,58
ALAN: We have three
new musicians.


203
0:8:35,58 --> 0:8:38,71
So come on by, you know.


204
0:8:38,71 --> 0:8:42,59
ALAN: Bring Susanna and
come on by, and--


205
0:8:42,59 --> 0:8:44,15
ALAN: Well, anytime really, just
come on by and if you see


206
0:8:44,15 --> 0:8:44,63
people there.


207
0:8:44,63 --> 0:8:45,48
And guess what?


208
0:8:45,48 --> 0:8:48,83
My dog had four puppies.


209
0:8:48,83 --> 0:8:50,99
I was going to leave for
Quartzite today, but I can't


210
0:8:50,99 --> 0:8:52,24
go nowhere now.


211
0:8:52,24 --> 0:8:58,3



212
0:8:58,3 --> 0:9:2,204
ALAN: All pit bull, two
boys and two females.


213
0:9:2,204 --> 0:9:3,78
ALAN: Yeah, it's just
the owners you've


214
0:9:3,78 --> 0:9:7,9
got to worry about.


215
0:9:7,9 --> 0:9:8,34
ALAN: All right.


216
0:9:8,34 --> 0:9:23,44



217
0:9:23,44 --> 0:9:24,9
ALAN: This is it.


218
0:9:24,9 --> 0:9:26,82
This is my homestead.


219
0:9:26,82 --> 0:9:30,51
I've been staying here for
about three months.


220
0:9:30,51 --> 0:9:33,63
My friends LD and April let
me move in over here.


221
0:9:33,63 --> 0:9:35,985
And I've been watching their
spot for them while they're


222
0:9:35,985 --> 0:9:36,86
gone throughout the week.


223
0:9:36,86 --> 0:9:39,96
And this is my home.


224
0:9:39,96 --> 0:9:43,48
It's also my dog's home, who
unfortunately, at this time,


225
0:9:43,48 --> 0:9:44,73
has four puppies.


226
0:9:44,73 --> 0:9:47,69



227
0:9:47,69 --> 0:9:51,54
She took this place over
and kicked me out.


228
0:9:51,54 --> 0:9:54,262
I don't even like
being in here.


229
0:9:54,262 --> 0:9:57,2
I just crash here.


230
0:9:57,2 --> 0:10:2,23
I'm really into the mineral
aspect of things.


231
0:10:2,23 --> 0:10:5,398
And I go out and dig
rocks and little


232
0:10:5,398 --> 0:10:8,14
knick-knacks and things.


233
0:10:8,14 --> 0:10:12,95
I mostly get my stuff from
gem shows, and I make


234
0:10:12,95 --> 0:10:14,554
little cabs and shit.


235
0:10:14,554 --> 0:10:16,226
TARA: How'd you learn
how to do it?


236
0:10:16,226 --> 0:10:18,4
ALAN: I don't know, I just kind
of took a pair of pliers


237
0:10:18,4 --> 0:10:19,59
and some copper wire one day.


238
0:10:19,59 --> 0:10:21,61
And I just twisted
up some rocks.


239
0:10:21,61 --> 0:10:25,14
But I would make stuff
like that.


240
0:10:25,14 --> 0:10:26,68
It's like, not even good work.


241
0:10:26,68 --> 0:10:32,1
I don't have no tools or no
inventory or anything.


242
0:10:32,1 --> 0:10:33,81
Come on, dog.


243
0:10:33,81 --> 0:10:34,97
Take a pup.


244
0:10:34,97 --> 0:10:36,32
Take that puppy.


245
0:10:36,32 --> 0:10:37,762
Take that pup.


246
0:10:37,762 --> 0:10:39,12
Good girl.


247
0:10:39,12 --> 0:11:5,71



248
0:11:5,71 --> 0:11:7,33
Camps are all different.


249
0:11:7,33 --> 0:11:9,424
Each one of them are unique.


250
0:11:9,424 --> 0:11:11,58
And they have unique people
staying there.


251
0:11:11,58 --> 0:11:13,716
And everyone's different,
so no camp is


252
0:11:13,716 --> 0:11:16,241
going to be the same.


253
0:11:16,241 --> 0:11:18,59
But a lot of people come here
because there's a lot of music


254
0:11:18,59 --> 0:11:19,74
here every night.


255
0:11:19,74 --> 0:11:22,22
Me and my friend Tony, we
sit out here and play.


256
0:11:22,22 --> 0:11:24,72
And people just show
up out of nowhere.


257
0:11:24,72 --> 0:11:26,765
And I've met some really
good people that way.


258
0:11:26,765 --> 0:11:49,535



259
0:11:49,535 --> 0:11:51,385
[LAUGHTER]


260
0:11:51,385 --> 0:11:54,41
MALE SPEAKER 7: Did
you get that?


261
0:11:54,41 --> 0:11:57,94
ERNIE QUINTERO: Did
he hit himself?


262
0:11:57,94 --> 0:11:59,36
MALE SPEAKER 7: Oh, it
was fucking awesome.


263
0:11:59,36 --> 0:11:59,97
ERNIE QUINTERO: Did
he hit himself?


264
0:11:59,97 --> 0:12:2,26
MALE SPEAKER 7: He just had
the whole thing down.


265
0:12:2,26 --> 0:12:3,76
[LAUGH]


266
0:12:3,76 --> 0:12:16,17



267
0:12:16,17 --> 0:12:18,43
TARA: We are going to go
to some hot springs.


268
0:12:18,43 --> 0:12:22,11
Alan's going be taking
us there.


269
0:12:22,11 --> 0:12:23,7
We're pretty much going
to be taking some


270
0:12:23,7 --> 0:12:25,96
bum baths, I guess.


271
0:12:25,96 --> 0:12:26,76
WHITNEY: Shit.


272
0:12:26,76 --> 0:12:29,35
TARA: And hopefully, we're
not going on another Alan


273
0:12:29,35 --> 0:12:32,8
adventure right now.


274
0:12:32,8 --> 0:12:34,28
WHITNEY: Is this where
the hot springs are?


275
0:12:34,28 --> 0:12:37,9
TARA: I think he's got his own
agenda on that, I'm not sure.


276
0:12:37,9 --> 0:12:39,15
But it'll be interesting
if we do.


277
0:12:39,15 --> 0:12:44,84



278
0:12:44,84 --> 0:12:46,22
ERNIE QUINTERO: Where's
the water come from?


279
0:12:46,22 --> 0:12:48,18
ALAN: Right there.


280
0:12:48,18 --> 0:12:51,171
From the water table.


281
0:12:51,171 --> 0:12:53,0
ERNIE QUINTERO: Oh, OK.


282
0:12:53,0 --> 0:12:53,455
ALAN: It's hot.


283
0:12:53,455 --> 0:12:56,3
It's like 110, 115 degrees.


284
0:12:56,3 --> 0:12:58,791
TARA: It's like a hot spring.


285
0:12:58,791 --> 0:13:0,162
ALAN: Are you getting in?


286
0:13:0,162 --> 0:13:1,76
ERNIE QUINTERO: Fuck yeah.


287
0:13:1,76 --> 0:13:1,99
ALAN: All right, [LAUGH].


288
0:13:1,99 --> 0:13:3,6
ERNIE QUINTERO: I'll get
in if you make a fire.


289
0:13:3,6 --> 0:13:5,515
Are you going to get in?


290
0:13:5,515 --> 0:13:7,3
ALAN: Only if you get all these
girls around here naked.


291
0:13:7,3 --> 0:13:8,248
ERNIE QUINTERO: [LAUGH]


292
0:13:8,248 --> 0:13:10,144
You've got to make a fire.


293
0:13:10,144 --> 0:13:11,566
ALAN: All right, deal.


294
0:13:11,566 --> 0:13:17,26



295
0:13:17,26 --> 0:13:18,927
ERNIE QUINTERO: Ahh,
it's all slimy.


296
0:13:18,927 --> 0:13:23,22
[YELLS OUT]


297
0:13:23,22 --> 0:13:25,26
TARA: Can you grab Ernie
another beer?


298
0:13:25,26 --> 0:13:28,5
ALAN: Sure.


299
0:13:28,5 --> 0:13:29,45
WHITNEY: Jesus.


300
0:13:29,45 --> 0:13:32,27
ALAN: Well, right now we're--


301
0:13:32,27 --> 0:13:36,71
ERNIE QUINTERO: Deep inside Slab
City hot spring, which is


302
0:13:36,71 --> 0:13:38,99
about 110, 115 degrees.


303
0:13:38,99 --> 0:13:39,74
WHITNEY: Yeah, I bet this
plays really good for--


304
0:13:39,74 --> 0:13:41,5
ALAN: And if you were
to feel the--


305
0:13:41,5 --> 0:13:43,3
TARA: No, don't.


306
0:13:43,3 --> 0:13:47,18
ALAN: Even 50 feet down from
here, it'd be boiling water.


307
0:13:47,18 --> 0:13:49,565
The Earth's crust out
here is only about a


308
0:13:49,565 --> 0:13:51,784
mile and a half thick.


309
0:13:51,784 --> 0:13:53,263
TARA: Here.


310
0:13:53,263 --> 0:13:54,44
ALAN: I'm going to
baptize you.


311
0:13:54,44 --> 0:13:55,14
ERNIE QUINTERO: He's going
to baptize me.


312
0:13:55,14 --> 0:13:56,39
I'm going to be an
official slabber.


313
0:13:56,39 --> 0:13:58,74



314
0:13:58,74 --> 0:13:59,418
ALAN: I do baptisms.


315
0:13:59,418 --> 0:14:1,13
I'm doing baptisms.


316
0:14:1,13 --> 0:14:3,23
Come on, baptisms.


317
0:14:3,23 --> 0:14:5,33
I baptize you in the
name of the Lord,


318
0:14:5,33 --> 0:14:6,809
son of the Holy Ghost.


319
0:14:6,809 --> 0:14:8,288
TARA: Wait, don't do it yet.


320
0:14:8,288 --> 0:14:9,274
ALAN: [LAUGH]


321
0:14:9,274 --> 0:14:10,76
TARA: Oh, that's too much.


322
0:14:10,76 --> 0:14:13,2
ERNIE QUINTERO: Oh


323
0:14:13,2 --> 0:14:14,97
ALAN: Secure the pants.


324
0:14:14,97 --> 0:14:16,458
ERNIE QUINTERO: [LAUGH]


325
0:14:16,458 --> 0:14:25,29



326
0:14:25,29 --> 0:14:26,68
ERNIE QUINTERO: You haven't
experienced Slab City unless


327
0:14:26,68 --> 0:14:28,27
you've been to the
hot springs.


328
0:14:28,27 --> 0:14:30,13
And I don't want to get out.


329
0:14:30,13 --> 0:14:31,82
ALAN: [LAUGH]


330
0:14:31,82 --> 0:14:33,13
ERNIE QUINTERO: I can't
see in the light!


331
0:14:33,13 --> 0:14:34,23
Whoa, that went right
in my hand.


332
0:14:34,23 --> 0:14:35,478
ALAN: That would have got me
right in the balls, and I


333
0:14:35,478 --> 0:14:37,888
would've been pissed.


334
0:14:37,888 --> 0:14:40,16
ERNIE QUINTERO: It would've
knocked his boner down.


335
0:14:40,16 --> 0:14:42,647
You can't blame the guy, dude.


336
0:14:42,647 --> 0:14:44,635
How many girls are in
Slab City right now?


337
0:14:44,635 --> 0:14:46,126
ALAN: None that I'd fuck.


338
0:14:46,126 --> 0:14:51,96
ERNIE QUINTERO: [LAUGH]


339
0:14:51,96 --> 0:15:0,42



340
0:15:0,42 --> 0:15:3,56
TARA: This was a good idea.


341
0:15:3,56 --> 0:15:10,69
WHITNEY: So what's your MO, do
you just stay in a place for a


342
0:15:10,69 --> 0:15:12,59
set amount of time?


343
0:15:12,59 --> 0:15:18,72
ALAN: I'm just, kind of, like,
I don't know, I come out here


344
0:15:18,72 --> 0:15:19,49
just to relax.


345
0:15:19,49 --> 0:15:20,93
WHITNEY: Is this your
first time out here?


346
0:15:20,93 --> 0:15:21,493
ALAN: Huh?


347
0:15:21,493 --> 0:15:22,3
WHITNEY: Is this your
first time out here?


348
0:15:22,3 --> 0:15:22,75
ERNIE QUINTERO: Been for
like three years.


349
0:15:22,75 --> 0:15:25,873
ALAN: No, I've been here for
like three and half years.


350
0:15:25,873 --> 0:15:28,18
WHITNEY: So it was just
time to move on?


351
0:15:28,18 --> 0:15:29,8
ALAN: No, not necessarily.


352
0:15:29,8 --> 0:15:31,65
This place will always
be with me.


353
0:15:31,65 --> 0:15:33,336
I always come back here.


354
0:15:33,336 --> 0:15:45,51



355
0:15:45,51 --> 0:15:46,76
ERNIE QUINTERO: In the car?


356
0:15:46,76 --> 0:15:52,9



357
0:15:52,9 --> 0:15:53,65
ERNIE QUINTERO: What?


358
0:15:53,65 --> 0:15:54,93
ALAN: Do you want to go with?


359
0:15:54,93 --> 0:15:56,57
I'm just meeting up with
somebody real quick.


360
0:15:56,57 --> 0:15:58,19
ERNIE QUINTERO: OK.


361
0:15:58,19 --> 0:15:59,946
With everybody, or--


362
0:15:59,946 --> 0:16:1,21
ALAN: Just you and me.


363
0:16:1,21 --> 0:16:1,56
Is that cool?


364
0:16:1,56 --> 0:16:3,62
I mean, like, they can stay here
for 10 minutes, right?


365
0:16:3,62 --> 0:16:4,955
While we do this.


366
0:16:4,955 --> 0:16:6,29
Just someone has to
come with me.


367
0:16:6,29 --> 0:16:9,184
ERNIE QUINTERO: OK, yeah,
yeah, I'll go with you.


368
0:16:9,184 --> 0:16:11,148
ALAN: I mean, you don't have
to go with me, but I sure--


369
0:16:11,148 --> 0:16:12,13
ERNIE QUINTERO: No, no,
I'll go with you, man.


370
0:16:12,13 --> 0:16:14,94

to go with me.


371
0:16:14,94 --> 0:16:17,5



372
0:16:17,5 --> 0:16:18,623
ERNIE QUINTERO: Hey
Alan, where are we


373
0:16:18,623 --> 0:16:19,652
going to right now?


374
0:16:19,652 --> 0:16:21,92
ALAN: Dope man's house.


375
0:16:21,92 --> 0:16:23,73
ERNIE QUINTERO: What kind of
dope are we going to get?


376
0:16:23,73 --> 0:16:25,19
ALAN: Crystal meth.


377
0:16:25,19 --> 0:16:29,9
Meth has been going on here
since shit, Christ was born,


378
0:16:29,9 --> 0:16:30,57
it seems like.


379
0:16:30,57 --> 0:16:35,59
But more often than not, you'll
find good people, even


380
0:16:35,59 --> 0:16:38,18
if they are tweakers.


381
0:16:38,18 --> 0:16:40,62
I hope my mom doesn't
see this.


382
0:16:40,62 --> 0:16:42,8
[LAUGH]


383
0:16:42,8 --> 0:16:44,4
ERNIE QUINTERO: That looks
fucking-- a little sketchy


384
0:16:44,4 --> 0:16:46,0
right there.


385
0:16:46,0 --> 0:16:46,44

0:16:50,425 --> 0:16:51,36

I'm just fine.

393
0:16:54,55 --> 0:16:57,64

0:16:57,64 --> 0:16:58,76
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]


395
0:16:58,76 --> 0:16:59,663
