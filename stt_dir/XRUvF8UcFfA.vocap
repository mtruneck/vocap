###4 FEMALE SPEAKER: Welcome to Fashion Week International, a
###8 new show that reports on the most fabulous fashion weeks in
###10 the world, and the culture and politics behind them.
###14 We've saved the best until last, a fashion week in the
###18 capital city of chaos.
###19 
###30 This is Lagos, Nigeria.
###32 It's home to 8 or 15 or 18 million people, depending
###37 which census figure you believe.
###39 And like anywhere with a large population density, it's not
###43 without its troubles.
###45 Civil, state-sponsored homophobia, religious tension,
###50 and widespread corruption are among the many factors that
###53 have led to calls for the resignation of longstanding
###56 president, Goodluck Jonathan.
###57 
###63 MALE SPEAKER: Actually, such elements of
###64 society should be killed.
###66 FEMALE SPEAKER: With that in mind, we prepared ourselves
###68 for Nigeria Fashion Week with not a little trepidation.
###72 But like all the fabulous placed we've visited so far
###75 this series, we were sure we'd find something beautiful
###78 behind the depressing headlines.
###79 
###87 There are many different fashion weeks held throughout
###90 the year in Lagos.
###90 But we were here for what we were assured was the official
###94 Nigeria Fashion Week.
###95 
###100 First stop was the headquarters of the
###102 organizers, Legendary Gold.
###103 
###108 We've arrived at the Legendary Gold offices.
###112 And this is the hub of the fashion week.
###113 We're going to inside and get legendary
###115 services valuable as gold.
###118 The fantastically named Lexy Mojo-Eyes
###121 is the man in charge.
###123 He also looks like Don King, if Don King
###126 had gone into fashion.
###127 
###137 FEMALE SPEAKER: What does fashion mean to you?
###138 
###152 FEMALE SPEAKER: The models are assembled
###153 for a fitting session.
###154 And things were getting very naked.
###157 And so I went in search of the boys.
###161 MALE SPEAKER: (SINGING) Before you choose to use, before you
###163 choose to use, use your device so you don't have rain drops
###169 falling from your eyes.
###172 [INAUDIBLE].
###173 
###175 Gonna have to pay the price, pay the price.
###179 
###186 FEMALE SPEAKER: In what way are you quirky?
###187 
###196 [LAUGHTER]
###197 
###203 [LAUGHTER]
###205 
###209 FEMALE SPEAKER: That's girly?
###211 FEMALE SPEAKER: I thought this was more serious.
###213 
###222 MALE SPEAKER: Becuase I love Africa.
###224 Africa is the best place to be.
###226 And when you come closer, you find out that we are friendly
###229 people, good people.
###230 For example, in Nigeria right now, are we not friendly?
###234 FEMALE SPEAKERS (IN UNISON): Welcome to Nigeria Fashion
###236 Week, [INAUDIBLE].
###238 [CHEERING]
###240 FEMALE SPEAKER: The fashion itself was being held at a
###242 slightly rundown looking government building where
###245 Prince Charles himself had laid the first stone.
###249 It's quarter past 12:00.
###252 Which is a bit worrying, because the show is supposed
###254 to start at 12:00.
###255 And so far, there's no show.
###258 There's about six models backstage who still haven't
###260 had their hair and makeup done.
###262 And there's no audience.
###264 We went to check out the backstage progress.
###268 Tempers were already rising.
###269 
###275 FRED EBOKA: I told you, you sit here.
###277 Isn't it?
###278 You are going back this way.
###279 FEMALE SPEAKER: This way.
###279 FRED EBOKA: Yes, exactly.
###280 So you go now.
###282 And you follow.
###283 Come back.
###284 [INAUDIBLE]
###284 just stand here.
###285 That's what I tell you.
###286 I do not want drama.
###288 I don't want drama, because I'm full of drama.
###292 [LAUGHTER]
###294 FRED EBOKA: My standards mustn't go down
###296 because I'm in Nigeria.
###297 Standards should be the same to you all over the world.
###299 But for some reason--
###301 FEMALE SPEAKER: It's not very good.
###302 FRED EBOKA: --I have to adapt myself to a certain degree.
###305 People can wait.
###306 And they have such patience.
###307 I don't have that kind of patience.
###309 Don't deny me attention.
###310 Otherwise I go very crazy and a drama, drama queen.
###313 
###318 FEMALE SPEAKER: However, Lexy didn't quite see the problem.
###320 
###333 FEMALE SPEAKER: If you want something to start at 12:00,
###336 you tell people to get there at 8:00 AM.
###339 [LAUGHTER]
###340 FEMALE SPEAKER: And sure enough, two hours after the
###342 first show was scheduled to begin, the glamorous crowds
###345 started to roll in, each one making sure to take a turn on
###349 the red carpet.
###350 MALE SPEAKER: Whoa!
###352 FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].
###354 FEMALE SPEAKER: Whoa!
###355 The thing just collapsed on me.
###357 Oh my God.
###358 It's going to fall off.
###359 So if I move, it's all over.
###362 But then they kill this beautiful lady.
###366 Go, let's go.
###367 
###377 FEMALE SPEAKER: Anyone got matches?
###381 FEMALE SPEAKER: This year's theme was going green.
###383 This is understandable given Lagos's
###386 critical pollution issues.
###387 Energy efficient light bulb hats and dresses made out of
###390 leaves ere made to look surprising elegant by the
###393 gorgeous girls.
###394 And the boy's helped out by donning what looked to be
###397 lederhosen made of hay.
###399 One designer who stood out was self-taught Dabo, who
###403 specialized in pairing recycled plastic and
###406 traditional fabrics with sexy results.
###408 
###417 FEMALE SPEAKER: I love this.
###418 Quite sexual.
###419 Do people say to you, oh my God, Dabo?
###421 DABO: Yeah, Dabo [INAUDIBLE].
###422 [LAUGHTER]
###424 FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm trying it.
###425 
###428 FEMALE SPEAKER: Look, they're all going to laugh at us.
###429 
###440 FEMALE SPEAKER: Whilst the girls maintained a
###441 professional front, the boys just seemed to be having a
###444 great time admiring their own beauty and other attributes.
###447 
###456 FEMALE SPEAKER: So the more hard you work, the bigger
###459 penis you have?
###460 
###467 FEMALE SPEAKER: Guys are more vain than girls.
###469 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###470 
###479 FEMALE SPEAKER: I'll give it to you.
###480 
###489 FEMALE SPEAKER: If men wore makeup in the street, what
###492 would happen to them?
###493 
###500 FEMALE SPEAKER: It wasn't just social discrimination the gay
###503 community had to worry about.
###505 Homophobic sentiment had recently been
###507 enshrined in law.
###508 
###524 FEMALE SPEAKER: We'd met Datari, a fellow Englishman
###527 backstage, former stylist to UK boy bands such as Boyzone.
###531 He'd come to Lagos to pursue business opportunities.
###534 However, the recent developments meant he was
###537 considering going back to the UK.
###539 DATARI: If you're really camp, then trust me, you can't
###541 survive in Nigeria.
###542 Why do you think I wear shirts and hats all the time?
###544 I'm the butch, you know what I me?
###547 I wish I could train my voice.
###548 Because that's, like, a giveaway,
###549 you know what I mean?
###551 If you're gay, you either get killed, or you go to prison,
###555 you get disowned by your family.
###557 That's why most Nigerian celebs, or Nigerian guys go
###563 abroad to end up staying there and claiming asylum.
###566 Someone calls the police.
###567 And all of you get humiliated, put you on TV.
###572 No only are you out to the government.
###575 You're out to your family, to your friends.
###576 I mean, you've lived a lie all your life.
###579 And then all of a sudden, you're on TV for what?
###581 For being gay.
###582 Eventually, if you come out of prison, you can't even go back
###585 to your home town anymore because
###587 everyone knows about it.
###588 [INAUDIBLE]
###589 stoning you, calling you names.
###592 Trust me, you'll get caught.
###594 
###604 FEMALE SPEAKER: After meeting Datari and having him tell us
###607 how the majority of gay people in Niger have to conceal their
###610 sexuality for fear of going to prison, we started to wonder
###614 how many other people at this fashion event were hiding
###616 their true identity.
###620 BLESSED: Your face, you make it ugly.
###622 Yeah, you don't do it with your fine face.
###625 
###628 FEMALE SPEAKER: This is our friend Blessed, the
###630 hairdresser.
###631 
###635 FEMALE SPEAKER: From the moment we arrived, wherever we
###637 went, Blessed went too.
###639 To the extent that we could barely talk to anyone else.
###644 Off camera, he told us some surprising things about the
###647 gay community.
###648 He invited us to come visit his neighborhood so that he
###651 could talk a bit more freely.
###652 
###663 First, we met his mother and his nephew.
###666 
###670 And then he took us to some of his friends' houses.
###672 BLESSED: This is [INAUDIBLE]
###674 apartment.
###675 Yes.
###677 
###679 FEMALE SPEAKER: After that, he took us to the biggest street
###681 market in Lagos.
###682 BLESSED: We are in [INAUDIBLE]
###683 Market.
###685 FEMALE SPEAKER: This is one of the most hectic, overcrowded
###687 markets in the world, with thousands of people passing
###690 through it at all times.
###692 
###696 And then, Blessed too us somewhere he could confess a
###698 few things about his relationship
###700 with the fashion world.
###702 We're at a salon where Blessed used to work.
###704 And they're going to do my nails,
###706 because they need doing.
###708 Why did you become a hairdresser?
###709 
###726 FEMALE SPEAKER: But you are not gay, obviously.
###728 
###750 BLESSED: Don't say it.
###751 FEMALE SPEAKER: I won't say it.
###752 
###763 FEMALE SPEAKER: In the fashion industry?
###764 
###775 FEMALE SPEAKER: Lagos is a deeply God-fearing city, with
###778 the church having a firm hold over the population.
###782 Even some of the fashion photographers haven't quite
###785 reconciled their faith with the decadent display of flesh
###788 at the fashion week.
###790 All the models were, like, running around naked.
###792 How did it feel?
###793 
###830 Despite Justice's revelation that we're all going to hell,
###833 we return for the finale and caught up with some fellow
###836 sinners on the red carpet.
###838 Including my favorite, the stylish
###841 queen mother of Nigeria.
###844 FEMALE SPEAKER: I can tell.
###845 
###848 FEMALE SPEAKER: And then, Mr. Nigeria, Deji Bakare, who
###852 describes himself as a rapper and a singer.
###855 
###873 FEMALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHS].
###874 
###879 What I love the most about Nigeria Fashion Week was how
###881 the designers and models celebrated
###883 traditional African beauty.
###886 There were no blonde hair weaves, no plastic surgery,
###889 limited influence by Western design.
###892 This was truly a celebration of pure Nigerian beauty.
###897 And backstage, it was a celebration of
###899 pure Nigerian chaos.
###901 
###907 This guy is the winner of Nigerian Big Brother 2011.
###911 His arrival backstage caused further chaos, with the
###914 models, their friends and hangers on all clamoring to
###917 get a private audience with their idol.
###919 
###927 FEMALE SPEAKER: But because this was the final show and so
###929 much was at state, the head of security was called to come
###933 and eject him from backstage.
###934 But instead, the security guy let him off in
###937 exchange for an autograph.
###938 
###941 FEMALE SPEAKER: And here he is thinking about it.
###945 Hm, maybe in a minute.
###947 Nah, I'll just get his autograph and let him stay.
###950 
###955 Despite the general madness, Nigeria Fashion
###958 Week ended on a high.
###959 But just as we thought our Nigerian fashion adventure was
###963 over, we were invited to this.
###965 
###969 Nigeria's Next Supermodel is a tribute to Tyra Banks's
###972 America's Next Top Model.
###975 Although we're not really sure if Tyra's ever
###977 actually seen it.
###979 It's run by Joan, former Miss Nigeria.
###985 JOAN: This is my house here on the left.
###987 And of course, the small bungalow is where we do a lot
###993 of our stuff for the girls.
###996 FEMALE SPEAKER: And they've been living there, have they?
###997 JOAN: Yeah, yeah.
###998 The girls have been here.
###1000 FEMALE SPEAKER: That's [INAUDIBLE].
###1002 FEMALE SPEAKER: The dozen or so finalists in the contest
###1004 had been living in her garage in Lagos, undergoing a sort of
###1008 modeling boot camp.
###1010 Along with her nephew, David.
###1013 DAVID: Three, two, one, let's go.
###1016 
###1091 FEMALE SPEAKER: The finale of Nigeria's Next Supermodel was
###1093 being help in a luxurious hotel on the [INAUDIBLE] of
###1096 the lagoon.
###1098 Here we are.
###1099 We were here to witness the dreams of one
###1101 young girl come true.
###1104 So already this is very different from
###1107 Nigeria Fashion Week.
###1108 This is really kind of slick.
###1110 It's a bit swanky.
###1111 [INAUDIBLE].
###1112 
###1124 FEMALE SPEAKER: The crowd promptly arrived
###1126 dressed to be seen.
###1127 
###1133 FEMALE SPEAKER: After four hours of dress rehearsals,
###1136 yelling, people being kicked out then let back in--
###1140 
###1145 FEMALE SPEAKER: --the audience were finally allowed to take
###1147 their seats.
###1148 
###1167 FEMALE SPEAKER: They waited another hour.
###1169 The models finally emerged, only to exit the room
###1172 immediately.
###1173 
###1179 We had no idea what was going on.
###1182 But we figured it was best to follow the talent.
###1184 
###1189 Where are you going?
###1191 
###1195 FEMALE SPEAKER: We were in the venue.
###1196 The audience arrived all in their glad rags.
###1199 The models walk out, pile into this tiny van.
###1203 And now they're going on a yacht.
###1205 I don't know what the audience were thinking
###1207 about the whole thing.
###1209 Yeah, but we're all right.
###1210 We've got the models.
###1212 We've got them.
###1213 We're going into this weird building, which looks like--
###1217 don't know.
###1218 
###1224 It's a very unusual situation.
###1227 MR. PERFECT: One, two, three, four.
###1230 FEMALE SPEAKER: Upon reaching the docks, Mr. Perfect, the
###1232 choreographer, promptly engaged the models in a kind
###1235 of military style marching [INAUDIBLE], all whilst
###1238 wearing six inch heels.
###1241 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###1242 
###1249 FEMALE SPEAKER: How many times have you rehearsed?
###1252 MR. PERFECT: Three times.
###1253 FEMALE SPEAKER: Just three?
###1253 MR. PERFECT: Yeah.
###1254 We'll make it.
###1255 
###1260 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1270 FEMALE SPEAKER: Out on the deck of the yacht, looking
###1273 around at these wonderful girls dancing under the
###1275 enormous African sky, all worries we had about what the
###1279 hell was going on disappeared.
###1280 
###1284 [CHEERING]
###1286 [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1299 FEMALE SPEAKER: Of all the moments I've experienced on
###1301 this first season of Fashion Week Internationale, from
###1304 blackouts and bomb shelters in Islamabad, being eaten alive
###1308 by mosquitoes on a cattle truck in Cambodia, and who can
###1311 forgetting witnessing live ass surgery in Colombia?
###1315 I think that being there on that yacht in Lagos was
###1317 something that will stay with me forever.
###1321 And that's why I momentarily lost control of my senses.
###1327 [SINGING]
###1327 Every night in my dreams--
###1331 FEMALE SPEAKERS (IN UNISON): [SINGING]
###1331 I see you, I feel you.
###1336 That is how I know you go on.
###1340 
###1344 All across the distance and spaces between us, you
###1353 [INAUDIBLE]
###1354 to show you go on.
###1358 
###1361 Near, far, wherever you are, I will believe that my heart
###1372 will go on.
###1374 
###1378 Once more, you open the door.
###1385 And you're here--
###1387 [AIR HORN]
###1390 FEMALE SPEAKERS (IN UNISON): [SINGING]
###1390 My heart will go on and on.
###1397 [CHEERING]
###1400 
###1404 FEMALE SPEAKER: After all that time on the yacht, I'd almost
###1406 forgotten what we were there for, until the contestants
###1409 sprung into action.
###1411 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1427 FEMALE SPEAKER: Before the final results were announced,
###1429 Joan's nephew David took to the floor to performance a
###1433 song he'd prepared specially for the occasion.
###1434 
###1439 [APPLAUSE]
###1443 DAVID: [SINGING]
###1444 [INAUDIBLE] can't you see?
###1446 You were made to fly far above the clouds.
###1454 You were made to fly.
###1456 
###1468 JOAN: These three girls are the ones that [INAUDIBLE].
###1473 [CHEERING]
###1483 JOAN: Second runner up is [INAUDIBLE].
###1487 Ladies and gentlemen, the first runner up, [INAUDIBLE]!
