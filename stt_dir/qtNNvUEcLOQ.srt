1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,18



2
0:0:1,18 --> 0:0:2,18
MALE SPEAKER: All right.


3
0:0:2,18 --> 0:0:5,32
Thank you guys for coming
to this screening and Q&A


4
0:0:5,32 --> 0:0:7,89
regarding "Extreme By Design."


5
0:0:7,89 --> 0:0:12,306
It's a new documentary film
that premiered early December.


6
0:0:12,306 --> 0:0:13,14
AUDIENCE: Yeah.


7
0:0:13,14 --> 0:0:13,687
December 11.


8
0:0:13,687 --> 0:0:15,52
MALE SPEAKER: December
11, premiered on PBS.


9
0:0:15,52 --> 0:0:16,978
So we're lucky
enough today to have


10
0:0:16,978 --> 0:0:20,235
here Ralph King, the director,
along with two people that


11
0:0:20,235 --> 0:0:22,37
are with him that are also
part of the Stanford D


12
0:0:22,37 --> 0:0:24,2
School, the Stanford
Design School.


13
0:0:24,2 --> 0:0:30,43
Which is one of the biggest
design thinking evangelists,


14
0:0:30,43 --> 0:0:31,1
I would say.


15
0:0:31,1 --> 0:0:32,82
I feel like you can't
hear about design thinking


16
0:0:32,82 --> 0:0:33,97
without hearing about Stamford.


17
0:0:33,97 --> 0:0:35,49
So it's great to
have them with us.


18
0:0:35,49 --> 0:0:36,57
I'm going to tell you a
little bit about them,


19
0:0:36,57 --> 0:0:38,278
and then we'll go
right to the screening.


20
0:0:38,278 --> 0:0:40,32
And then have a Q&A
afterwards with an open forum


21
0:0:40,32 --> 0:0:41,66
for everyone.


22
0:0:41,66 --> 0:0:45,33
So "Extreme By
Design," at a time


23
0:0:45,33 --> 0:0:47,15
of unprecedented
global challenges,


24
0:0:47,15 --> 0:0:49,64
the under 30
millennial generation


25
0:0:49,64 --> 0:0:51,7
has every reason
to be disengaged.


26
0:0:51,7 --> 0:0:54,19
Yet plenty of
millennials are engaged.


27
0:0:54,19 --> 0:0:55,555
Call it the empathy revolution.


28
0:0:55,555 --> 0:0:57,23
That's a big Stanford thing.


29
0:0:57,23 --> 0:0:59,68
"Extreme by Design," an
hour long documentary film,


30
0:0:59,68 --> 0:1:2,28
brings this revolution to life
by following three Stanford


31
0:1:2,28 --> 0:1:5,67
University students as they
design and build products


32
0:1:5,67 --> 0:1:8,94
to meet basic needs
of the world's poor.


33
0:1:8,94 --> 0:1:10,4
And I'll tell you
in just a minute,


34
0:1:10,4 --> 0:1:14,82
expand on that, about a program
that our two other guests


35
0:1:14,82 --> 0:1:17,22
have designed on PBS
Learning Media that's


36
0:1:17,22 --> 0:1:19,932
an extension of this
experience and this lesson.


37
0:1:19,932 --> 0:1:21,89
So I'll get to tell you
about that in a minute.


38
0:1:21,89 --> 0:1:24,31
And our director,
Ralph, is a graduate


39
0:1:24,31 --> 0:1:25,97
of Stanford, an
independent filmmaker,


40
0:1:25,97 --> 0:1:28,37
and founder of
Hawk View Pictures.


41
0:1:28,37 --> 0:1:31,66
Prior to filmmaking,
he spent 25 years


42
0:1:31,66 --> 0:1:33,48
as a reporter for the
"Wall Street Journal"


43
0:1:33,48 --> 0:1:35,95
and several national magazines.


44
0:1:35,95 --> 0:1:40,56
And he was twice nominated by
"Wall Street Journal" editors


45
0:1:40,56 --> 0:1:44,58
for the Pulitzer Prize and
won the National Association


46
0:1:44,58 --> 0:1:47,61
of Science Writer's
Science in Society award


47
0:1:47,61 --> 0:1:50,71
and the California
Governor's Media award.


48
0:1:50,71 --> 0:1:52,19
Ralph recently
became a filmmaker.


49
0:1:52,19 --> 0:1:54,44
And said you you've been
working on this one for about


50
0:1:54,44 --> 0:1:55,15
four years?


51
0:1:55,15 --> 0:1:55,858
RALPH KING: Yeah.


52
0:1:55,858 --> 0:1:58,15
Right in the first four
years before it all started.


53
0:1:58,15 --> 0:1:58,7
MALE SPEAKER: There you go.


54
0:1:58,7 --> 0:2:0,8
So four years on
this one, I think


55
0:2:0,8 --> 0:2:1,79
you would say this is
probably your first big one?


56
0:2:1,79 --> 0:2:2,7
RALPH KING: Yeah.


57
0:2:2,7 --> 0:2:2,903
MALE SPEAKER: Right?


58
0:2:2,903 --> 0:2:5,6
So now onto our
two other guests.


59
0:2:5,6 --> 0:2:9,7
One is Leticia Cavagnaro.


60
0:2:9,7 --> 0:2:11,9
She comes from the
world of science,


61
0:2:11,9 --> 0:2:13,43
where she acquired
a couple of degrees.


62
0:2:13,43 --> 0:2:14,53
I like how you said that.


63
0:2:14,53 --> 0:2:17,57
"A couple of
degrees," no big deal.


64
0:2:17,57 --> 0:2:19,62
Strong analytical skills,
which she balances


65
0:2:19,62 --> 0:2:21,69
with creative thinking,
and the ability to learn


66
0:2:21,69 --> 0:2:23,929
from failed experiments.


67
0:2:23,929 --> 0:2:25,47
Venturing outside
of the biology lab,


68
0:2:25,47 --> 0:2:27,511
Leticia found that designing
learning experiences


69
0:2:27,511 --> 0:2:31,26
was just as challenging
and even more rewarding.


70
0:2:31,26 --> 0:2:35,54
Leticia is now adjunct faculty
at the School of Engineering's


71
0:2:35,54 --> 0:2:38,66
Stanford Technology
Ventures Program


72
0:2:38,66 --> 0:2:44,19
and the deputy
director-- there we go,


73
0:2:44,19 --> 0:2:46,64
recently changed-- deputy
director of the National Center


74
0:2:46,64 --> 0:2:50,5
for Engineering Pathways to
Innovation, known as Epicenter.


75
0:2:50,5 --> 0:2:53,14
And as a co-lecturer on the
Creativity and Innovation


76
0:2:53,14 --> 0:2:55,629
course, which here you
guys might know as CSI,


77
0:2:55,629 --> 0:2:57,42
she gets to witness
the journey of students


78
0:2:57,42 --> 0:2:59,128
as they develop their
creative confidence


79
0:2:59,128 --> 0:3:1,18
and go on accomplishing
amazing things.


80
0:3:1,18 --> 0:3:3,92
Which you guys will definitely
see in this next hour.


81
0:3:3,92 --> 0:3:8,124
And our other guest
is Melissa Pelochino.


82
0:3:8,124 --> 0:3:9,4
I love that last name.


83
0:3:9,4 --> 0:3:10,58
That's such a good one.


84
0:3:10,58 --> 0:3:13,39
Fellow at the Stanford D
school, her current focus


85
0:3:13,39 --> 0:3:15,59
is on redesigning the
professional development


86
0:3:15,59 --> 0:3:19,4
experience for K-12
teachers and administrators.


87
0:3:19,4 --> 0:3:23,1
Which again, you'll see in
this PBS Learning Media.


88
0:3:23,1 --> 0:3:25,2
Melissa is a former
teacher and administrator


89
0:3:25,2 --> 0:3:26,69
in low-income schools.


90
0:3:26,69 --> 0:3:29,55
And after learning about
design thinking in 2007,


91
0:3:29,55 --> 0:3:33,1
she began her mission to
integrate the design thinking


92
0:3:33,1 --> 0:3:36,906
process and mindsets into K-12
schools all over the world.


93
0:3:36,906 --> 0:3:38,53
There's some really
interesting stories


94
0:3:38,53 --> 0:3:40,38
that follow that as well.


95
0:3:40,38 --> 0:3:44,6
Now to tell you about
the PBS Learning Media.


96
0:3:44,6 --> 0:3:46,29
Would you probably call it
"Extreme by Design Watch


97
0:3:46,29 --> 0:3:47,38
and Do"?


98
0:3:47,38 --> 0:3:48,68
Did I get that right?


99
0:3:48,68 --> 0:3:51,68
So the idea of this is it's
an interactive experience


100
0:3:51,68 --> 0:3:55,53
on PBS Learning Media, which
is a resource for teachers.


101
0:3:55,53 --> 0:3:57,96
And it's designed for fourth
through 12th grade students


102
0:3:57,96 --> 0:4:0,71
to be completed after watching
the "Extreme by Design"


103
0:4:0,71 --> 0:4:2,17
documentary.


104
0:4:2,17 --> 0:4:5,3
For example, the first
episode, "Being an Innovator"


105
0:4:5,3 --> 0:4:7,24
helps students think
and act like innovators


106
0:4:7,24 --> 0:4:9,86
using the design
thinking approach.


107
0:4:9,86 --> 0:4:13,18
Scenes from this documentary
are used to illustrate concepts,


108
0:4:13,18 --> 0:4:16,115
and a protagonist acts as a
guide who provides instructions


109
0:4:16,115 --> 0:4:18,47
and explanations
to the students.


110
0:4:18,47 --> 0:4:21,269
And that's narrated
by all three?


111
0:4:21,269 --> 0:4:23,59
Or one of the students
that we see in the film?


112
0:4:23,59 --> 0:4:23,86
MELISSA PELOCHINO:
One of the students.


113
0:4:23,86 --> 0:4:25,34
MALE SPEAKER: Just one of the
students we see in the film.


114
0:4:25,34 --> 0:4:27,965
He narrates this whole learning
experience, which teachers then


115
0:4:27,965 --> 0:4:29,9
take to their
classroom to expand


116
0:4:29,9 --> 0:4:31,31
on this "Extreme
by Design" film.


117
0:4:31,31 --> 0:4:33,976
Which I think is a very cool way
of not only learning something,


118
0:4:33,976 --> 0:4:35,962
but then putting it into action.


119
0:4:35,962 --> 0:4:37,67
So we'll go ahead and
watch the film now,


120
0:4:37,67 --> 0:4:40,28
and then we'll have a
Q&A right afterwards.


121
0:4:40,28 --> 0:4:42,23
AUDIENCE: How do you
come up with the universe


122
0:4:42,23 --> 0:4:43,72
of potential solutions?


123
0:4:43,72 --> 0:4:45,22
I didn't see anything on that.


124
0:4:45,22 --> 0:4:47,15
What's the winnowing
process that you


125
0:4:47,15 --> 0:4:51,77
go to take that large universe
down to a small subset


126
0:4:51,77 --> 0:4:53,3
that you're then
going to proceed


127
0:4:53,3 --> 0:4:57,689
to invest the time
and effort in.


128
0:4:57,689 --> 0:4:58,98
And how can that be replicable?


129
0:4:58,98 --> 0:5:0,63
Because I think
that's something that


130
0:5:0,63 --> 0:5:4,67
would be useful
to take from this.


131
0:5:4,67 --> 0:5:6,42
LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO:
So I should say,


132
0:5:6,42 --> 0:5:8,8
I do not teach this
specific class.


133
0:5:8,8 --> 0:5:12,33
And there's some variability
amongst the different D School


134
0:5:12,33 --> 0:5:12,92
classes.


135
0:5:12,92 --> 0:5:15,8
But for sure that the
process is not proprietary,


136
0:5:15,8 --> 0:5:19,8
and it's all shared.


137
0:5:19,8 --> 0:5:22,27
Many of the resources
that we use for teaching


138
0:5:22,27 --> 0:5:24,36
are shared on the web.


139
0:5:24,36 --> 0:5:28,91
Mostly, in a nutshell, the
design thinking process


140
0:5:28,91 --> 0:5:31,81
would start with
identifying problems


141
0:5:31,81 --> 0:5:33,65
from the user perspective.


142
0:5:33,65 --> 0:5:39,29
I think that came
through in the film.


143
0:5:39,29 --> 0:5:44,77
So for coming up
with ideas, there's


144
0:5:44,77 --> 0:5:47,0
many techniques
that you can use.


145
0:5:47,0 --> 0:5:50,8
But mostly it's a
very simple concept


146
0:5:50,8 --> 0:5:52,85
of going beyond the
first right answer.


147
0:5:52,85 --> 0:5:53,45
Right?


148
0:5:53,45 --> 0:5:57,91
And I think that when we
teach mostly engineers


149
0:5:57,91 --> 0:6:3,3
or other technical
students, we give them


150
0:6:3,3 --> 0:6:6,78
a very, very
well-defined problem.


151
0:6:6,78 --> 0:6:9,37
And we teach them to
come up with a solution.


152
0:6:9,37 --> 0:6:12,6
We should push them to think
of many possible solutions.


153
0:6:12,6 --> 0:6:15,67
So just that simple
concept is the start


154
0:6:15,67 --> 0:6:20,53
of getting them to think
beyond the first right answer.


155
0:6:20,53 --> 0:6:21,702
Do you want to add?


156
0:6:21,702 --> 0:6:23,16
MELISSA PELOCHINO:
I would just add


157
0:6:23,16 --> 0:6:27,3
in terms of criteria for
selection, it ranges.


158
0:6:27,3 --> 0:6:31,48
Sometimes criteria for selection
is given by the instructors,


159
0:6:31,48 --> 0:6:33,38
and sometimes it's not.


160
0:6:33,38 --> 0:6:38,0
I would say most importantly,
it's what's feasible.


161
0:6:38,0 --> 0:6:41,21
If you're having to
actually create something


162
0:6:41,21 --> 0:6:42,835
that you can make,
either an experience


163
0:6:42,835 --> 0:6:46,48
or a product, and also
what meets the need


164
0:6:46,48 --> 0:6:50,1
that you identified earlier on
in the process in the best way.


165
0:6:50,1 --> 0:6:51,95
And so students do brainstorm.


166
0:6:51,95 --> 0:6:55,59
There were some short
clips in the movie.


167
0:6:55,59 --> 0:6:57,5
They said "trainstorming"
as sort of a play


168
0:6:57,5 --> 0:6:58,41
on brainstorming.


169
0:6:58,41 --> 0:7:1,26
And some other short parts
where they were throwing


170
0:7:1,26 --> 0:7:4,32
Post-its up with a whole
bunch of different ideas.


171
0:7:4,32 --> 0:7:6,23
But as Leticia
said, there's a lot


172
0:7:6,23 --> 0:7:8,24
of different
strategies for getting


173
0:7:8,24 --> 0:7:10,22
outside the box of
what's possible,


174
0:7:10,22 --> 0:7:11,65
and to really weld ideas.


175
0:7:11,65 --> 0:7:14,59
And then criteria for narrowing
that down and selecting it.


176
0:7:14,59 --> 0:7:16,291
And there's several.


177
0:7:16,291 --> 0:7:18,54
RALPH KING: I guess I would
just add to that, defining


178
0:7:18,54 --> 0:7:20,9
the problem, as I
guess we all know


179
0:7:20,9 --> 0:7:23,66
is much more important
than finding the solution.


180
0:7:23,66 --> 0:7:28,12
So the Indonesian group that
was on this quixotic adventure


181
0:7:28,12 --> 0:7:30,17
that they didn't
realize they were


182
0:7:30,17 --> 0:7:33,95
looking for the wrong
thing, initially.


183
0:7:33,95 --> 0:7:36,53
The partner in those
countries, NGOs,


184
0:7:36,53 --> 0:7:38,6
will give you an assignment.


185
0:7:38,6 --> 0:7:41,33
But often you end
up way over here


186
0:7:41,33 --> 0:7:44,28
in the process of figuring
out something you can solve,


187
0:7:44,28 --> 0:7:48,56
or something that's the right
size for a six month course,


188
0:7:48,56 --> 0:7:52,7
or the little blue
sleeping bag, the embrace.


189
0:7:52,7 --> 0:7:54,5
Their initial assignment
was to come up


190
0:7:54,5 --> 0:7:56,185
with a cheaper,
in-hospital incubator.


191
0:7:56,185 --> 0:7:59,5
And within a matter of
days, when they were out


192
0:7:59,5 --> 0:8:1,4
in the field, they realized
that 95% of the babies


193
0:8:1,4 --> 0:8:4,58
are born out in the rural
villages and no electricity.


194
0:8:4,58 --> 0:8:7,41
So they basically walked
away from that partner


195
0:8:7,41 --> 0:8:9,35
and came up with that design.


196
0:8:9,35 --> 0:8:13,0
So problem definition,
I think, is also


197
0:8:13,0 --> 0:8:14,52
a long and important process.


198
0:8:14,52 --> 0:8:19,444



199
0:8:19,444 --> 0:8:19,985
AUDIENCE: Hi.


200
0:8:19,985 --> 0:8:20,95
Thanks again.


201
0:8:20,95 --> 0:8:24,52
I was curious about,
it occurred to me


202
0:8:24,52 --> 0:8:28,1
that the local people
in Indonesia or wherever


203
0:8:28,1 --> 0:8:31,72
would be motivated to
help solve these problems.


204
0:8:31,72 --> 0:8:34,25
And maybe they had
no time or resources,


205
0:8:34,25 --> 0:8:37,565
but there must be bright
people there, too.


206
0:8:37,565 --> 0:8:39,179
Is there effort
to, I don't know,


207
0:8:39,179 --> 0:8:41,539
transition some of the
solutions that way?


208
0:8:41,539 --> 0:8:46,84
Instead of, say, to Walmart
or wherever, and help


209
0:8:46,84 --> 0:8:47,58
continue the projects?


210
0:8:47,58 --> 0:8:48,288
RALPH KING: Yeah.


211
0:8:48,288 --> 0:8:50,89
I mean there's no--
this movie is set up


212
0:8:50,89 --> 0:8:52,78
as a West to East
kind of solution--


213
0:8:52,78 --> 0:8:56,6
but there's no reason why it
shouldn't be the other way.


214
0:8:56,6 --> 0:8:58,6
Or West to West and East
to East kind of thing.


215
0:8:58,6 --> 0:9:3,48
That the problem
solvers should ideally


216
0:9:3,48 --> 0:9:7,99
come from the culture
in which they live.


217
0:9:7,99 --> 0:9:10,99
Stanford, for one,
has an organization


218
0:9:10,99 --> 0:9:12,41
called The Seed Institute.


219
0:9:12,41 --> 0:9:16,17
They got a big gift from a local
couple that is now setting up


220
0:9:16,17 --> 0:9:20,785
D School like innovation labs
in places like Ghana and Myanmar


221
0:9:20,785 --> 0:9:22,65
and I think eight
other countries,


222
0:9:22,65 --> 0:9:25,92
they plan to create
for local entrepreneurs


223
0:9:25,92 --> 0:9:30,74
to learn the methodologies and
to incubate their companies.


224
0:9:30,74 --> 0:9:35,27
And then sometimes the
partners in these countries


225
0:9:35,27 --> 0:9:39,7
will come back to Stanford and
bring their staffs with them.


226
0:9:39,7 --> 0:9:42,86
Like the group, you saw the red
treadle pump there in Myanmar?


227
0:9:42,86 --> 0:9:44,72
Well that organization,
Proximity Design,


228
0:9:44,72 --> 0:9:47,53
sent a big group
back with our teams


229
0:9:47,53 --> 0:9:50,28
to study the school
and the process.


230
0:9:50,28 --> 0:9:53,704
And then have now
carried that back there.


231
0:9:53,704 --> 0:9:57,57
So there's an objection
raised that this


232
0:9:57,57 --> 0:10:1,73
seems a little
neo-colonial and just


233
0:10:1,73 --> 0:10:4,66
another version of charity.


234
0:10:4,66 --> 0:10:8,52
But there's no
reason why it can't


235
0:10:8,52 --> 0:10:10,44
be something that
operates locally.


236
0:10:10,44 --> 0:10:15,39
In fact, one of the projects
was, if you saw on the map,


237
0:10:15,39 --> 0:10:18,71
set in Arizona, an
Apache reservation.


238
0:10:18,71 --> 0:10:22,91
So within American
culture, obviously, there's


239
0:10:22,91 --> 0:10:24,88
lots of room for these
kinds of projects.


240
0:10:24,88 --> 0:10:26,57
And they happen here.


241
0:10:26,57 --> 0:10:29,375
But this particular class
tends to go overseas


242
0:10:29,375 --> 0:10:31,774
because of the way it's set up.


243
0:10:31,774 --> 0:10:33,44
MELISSA PELOCHINO:
And in fact this film


244
0:10:33,44 --> 0:10:37,35
is serving as inspiration
for exactly that to happen.


245
0:10:37,35 --> 0:10:41,28
We're working with a school in
India of fourth and fifth grade


246
0:10:41,28 --> 0:10:43,44
students who saw the film.


247
0:10:43,44 --> 0:10:47,47
And Ralph was there through
Skype to answer some Q&A.


248
0:10:47,47 --> 0:10:49,71
And then Leticia and I are
going to be leading them


249
0:10:49,71 --> 0:10:51,14
through their own
design challenge


250
0:10:51,14 --> 0:10:53,3
later next week, actually.


251
0:10:53,3 --> 0:10:55,91
So the film is
serving as inspiration


252
0:10:55,91 --> 0:10:58,754
to empower people,
children all over the world


253
0:10:58,754 --> 0:10:59,92
to solve their own problems.


254
0:10:59,92 --> 0:11:3,196



255
0:11:3,196 --> 0:11:5,82
AUDIENCE: So, Ralph, how did you
decide how to tell this story?


256
0:11:5,82 --> 0:11:8,685
Did you just follow your three
groups around with a camera,


257
0:11:8,685 --> 0:11:11,1
or did you look at
some other groups,


258
0:11:11,1 --> 0:11:14,576
and already have an outline
of what you were looking for?


259
0:11:14,576 --> 0:11:15,95
RALPH KING: The
question is why I


260
0:11:15,95 --> 0:11:18,88
decided to do this
particular story.


261
0:11:18,88 --> 0:11:23,2
I was working at the
Stanford Business School


262
0:11:23,2 --> 0:11:25,37
when I heard about this class.


263
0:11:25,37 --> 0:11:30,1
And I spent a year auditing the
course, or a six month cycle.


264
0:11:30,1 --> 0:11:34,28
And so I, as part
of that, went out


265
0:11:34,28 --> 0:11:37,24
with one of the student teams,
I mentioned earlier, to Myanmar.


266
0:11:37,24 --> 0:11:41,53
And filmmakers and journalists
weren't welcome in Myanmar


267
0:11:41,53 --> 0:11:43,21
at that time, so
I was a "student."


268
0:11:43,21 --> 0:11:46,8
And it was day four
of the trip, and I


269
0:11:46,8 --> 0:11:48,16
was feeling very
discouraged because I


270
0:11:48,16 --> 0:11:50,23
hadn't had any
startling observations


271
0:11:50,23 --> 0:11:52,42
to contribute to my team.


272
0:11:52,42 --> 0:11:57,505
And so I was kind of
shuffling through the town.


273
0:11:57,505 --> 0:12:2,59
And I noticed a family sitting
in a pagoda in a meditation


274
0:12:2,59 --> 0:12:3,67
room.


275
0:12:3,67 --> 0:12:7,425
They had come in for the
bizarre, the county fair, that


276
0:12:7,425 --> 0:12:9,55
was happening in the town,
and were about to leave.


277
0:12:9,55 --> 0:12:11,42
I sat down and asked if
I could interview them.


278
0:12:11,42 --> 0:12:12,45
They said sure.


279
0:12:12,45 --> 0:12:16,294
I started firing all my
journalistic questions at them


280
0:12:16,294 --> 0:12:19,31
and madly scribbling
my notebook.


281
0:12:19,31 --> 0:12:23,54
About 15 minutes into this
interview, I looked up.


282
0:12:23,54 --> 0:12:27,74
And there, in addition
to the six people,


283
0:12:27,74 --> 0:12:32,38
35 other people had just glided
in silently and sat down.


284
0:12:32,38 --> 0:12:35,92
And were watching
this whole thing


285
0:12:35,92 --> 0:12:38,4
going on with this
crazy westerner.


286
0:12:38,4 --> 0:12:40,981
And in that moment, I
just put my book down.


287
0:12:40,981 --> 0:12:41,73
And I leaned back.


288
0:12:41,73 --> 0:12:45,12
And I just was
filled with ecstasy.


289
0:12:45,12 --> 0:12:47,15
I've really felt
for the first time


290
0:12:47,15 --> 0:12:50,6
in 25 years as a journalist
that I understood


291
0:12:50,6 --> 0:12:52,96
the difference between
gathering facts and observing


292
0:12:52,96 --> 0:12:53,86
with an open heart.


293
0:12:53,86 --> 0:12:59,48
And this sudden
appearance of people


294
0:12:59,48 --> 0:13:1,89
totally unbeknownst to
me was like, for me,


295
0:13:1,89 --> 0:13:8,45
this kind of trumpets
blaring from the heavens,


296
0:13:8,45 --> 0:13:12,8
how much experience
I tend to exclude.


297
0:13:12,8 --> 0:13:16,33
It just was like discovering
a new capacity in myself.


298
0:13:16,33 --> 0:13:21,24
And so for the next two days,
I was like walking on air.


299
0:13:21,24 --> 0:13:26,84
And I thought, well, if even
auditing this class is having


300
0:13:26,84 --> 0:13:28,54
this kind of effect
on me, imagine


301
0:13:28,54 --> 0:13:30,57
what it's doing for
these 20 somethings who


302
0:13:30,57 --> 0:13:32,194
have skin in the game
and actually have


303
0:13:32,194 --> 0:13:35,21
to produce something for
people that they meet.


304
0:13:35,21 --> 0:13:39,66
So I felt like there was
a powerful element to it.


305
0:13:39,66 --> 0:13:44,42
And it was kind of like Pam
said, where the boundaries just


306
0:13:44,42 --> 0:13:44,97
collapse.


307
0:13:44,97 --> 0:13:48,34
And in that moment, she felt
like she just had to do this.


308
0:13:48,34 --> 0:13:50,64
Well that's kind of the way
I felt about this story.


309
0:13:50,64 --> 0:13:57,33
And so I guess
that's why I did it.


310
0:13:57,33 --> 0:14:0,42



311
0:14:0,42 --> 0:14:6,19
And I guess I would also like
to say that now that the film is


312
0:14:6,19 --> 0:14:8,54
made, it's become
something else.


313
0:14:8,54 --> 0:14:12,99
And that's partly why Melissa
and Leticia are here today.


314
0:14:12,99 --> 0:14:16,46
Because there is a kind
of movement in education


315
0:14:16,46 --> 0:14:20,44
now to bring design
thinking and these methods


316
0:14:20,44 --> 0:14:24,28
more into the mainstream,
more into young people's


317
0:14:24,28 --> 0:14:28,45
lives, in schools, and
also into companies.


318
0:14:28,45 --> 0:14:32,85
I know here at Google,
it's a fairly common


319
0:14:32,85 --> 0:14:34,3
or fairly well-known thing.


320
0:14:34,3 --> 0:14:38,9
But in other parts of
the country, less so.


321
0:14:38,9 --> 0:14:39,56
But we see little beginnings.


322
0:14:39,56 --> 0:14:46,86
So after making the film, I
came to my friends and said,


323
0:14:46,86 --> 0:14:48,76
how do we get this in
front of young people?


324
0:14:48,76 --> 0:14:50,71
Young people don't watch PBS.


325
0:14:50,71 --> 0:14:53,59
Which is where it broadcasted.


326
0:14:53,59 --> 0:14:54,6
So we start talking
about a workshop.


327
0:14:54,6 --> 0:14:57,17
And how could we incorporate
the film in a workshop?


328
0:14:57,17 --> 0:14:58,71
And so we did little clips.


329
0:14:58,71 --> 0:15:0,22
And we had this 90
minute workshop.


330
0:15:0,22 --> 0:15:1,78
And that was great.


331
0:15:1,78 --> 0:15:6,97
But we did it in some schools,
but how do we scale it?


332
0:15:6,97 --> 0:15:9,18
So then PBS offered
us an opportunity


333
0:15:9,18 --> 0:15:12,43
to put on their teacher
portal something online.


334
0:15:12,43 --> 0:15:17,8
And so Melissa and Leticia,
God bless them, took the film


335
0:15:17,8 --> 0:15:23,95
and created this wonderful
hour-long exercise,


336
0:15:23,95 --> 0:15:27,96
like a press play
exercise, that takes


337
0:15:27,96 --> 0:15:31,88
young people in a classroom
through the basic elements,


338
0:15:31,88 --> 0:15:33,28
the steps, of design thinking.


339
0:15:33,28 --> 0:15:36,57
So it gives them a flavor and
a taste of what it's like.


340
0:15:36,57 --> 0:15:41,6
And so what keeps
me up at night now


341
0:15:41,6 --> 0:15:45,9
is figuring out ways like
this to scale design thinking


342
0:15:45,9 --> 0:15:47,57
education.


343
0:15:47,57 --> 0:15:51,35
We're at a moment in
our education system


344
0:15:51,35 --> 0:15:52,92
where the common
core is coming in,


345
0:15:52,92 --> 0:15:56,74
which is much more process
oriented rather than content


346
0:15:56,74 --> 0:15:57,27
oriented.


347
0:15:57,27 --> 0:16:2,13
So it's kind of an inflection
point that is timely.


348
0:16:2,13 --> 0:16:9,82
And I actually would welcome
any ideas that you have,


349
0:16:9,82 --> 0:16:13,22
if you've experienced
the scaling


350
0:16:13,22 --> 0:16:16,32
of a new kind of
concept here at Google.


351
0:16:16,32 --> 0:16:17,73
And how that's done.


352
0:16:17,73 --> 0:16:23,666
I'm really looking and searching
for answers to that right now.


353
0:16:23,666 --> 0:16:25,79
AUDIENCE: I would love to
know about the challenges


354
0:16:25,79 --> 0:16:30,24
that you guys had trying to get
something like the CSI process


355
0:16:30,24 --> 0:16:32,86
onto this online
workshop for students.


356
0:16:32,86 --> 0:16:37,13
Because here it's a few hours
of hands-on, in the classroom,


357
0:16:37,13 --> 0:16:38,9
stuff that we do.


358
0:16:38,9 --> 0:16:40,25
So how did you guys
get that into scale


359
0:16:40,25 --> 0:16:43,11
and what were the challenges?


360
0:16:43,11 --> 0:16:44,71
LETICIA BRITOS
CAVAGNARO: So I should


361
0:16:44,71 --> 0:16:50,25
say that before attempting
to do this module for k-12,


362
0:16:50,25 --> 0:16:54,9
I had approached Ralph,
having seen the movie.


363
0:16:54,9 --> 0:16:57,41
And I did a massive online
course on design thinking.


364
0:16:57,41 --> 0:17:1,5
And I selected some of
the clips to illustrate


365
0:17:1,5 --> 0:17:3,6
some of the challenges.


366
0:17:3,6 --> 0:17:7,349
So I do believe that
you can translate


367
0:17:7,349 --> 0:17:9,43
this type of
experiential learning


368
0:17:9,43 --> 0:17:11,53
into an online experience.


369
0:17:11,53 --> 0:17:13,45
You just have to not be literal.


370
0:17:13,45 --> 0:17:13,95
Right?


371
0:17:13,95 --> 0:17:17,96
So when we think about an
online resource, we think, OK.


372
0:17:17,96 --> 0:17:23,26
There's going to be a video
of a lecture, and then a quiz


373
0:17:23,26 --> 0:17:26,66
that basically quizzes
you on whether you were


374
0:17:26,66 --> 0:17:28,109
paying attention to the lecture.


375
0:17:28,109 --> 0:17:28,7
Right?


376
0:17:28,7 --> 0:17:32,819
But the way I
defined that course


377
0:17:32,819 --> 0:17:33,86
was completely different.


378
0:17:33,86 --> 0:17:36,33
I thought, how can
I design something


379
0:17:36,33 --> 0:17:39,72
that is very personal
for each learner?


380
0:17:39,72 --> 0:17:43,35
And use the metaphor of
kind of like a "Choose


381
0:17:43,35 --> 0:17:44,89
Your Own Adventure" book.


382
0:17:44,89 --> 0:17:45,41
Right?


383
0:17:45,41 --> 0:17:48,75
So you would, according
to what you were seeing


384
0:17:48,75 --> 0:17:53,16
and what you were answering, and
like no right answer quizzes.


385
0:17:53,16 --> 0:17:56,46
You would be pointed
to different parts


386
0:17:56,46 --> 0:17:59,6
of the materials that
were meaningful to you.


387
0:17:59,6 --> 0:17:59,84
Right?


388
0:17:59,84 --> 0:18:6,61
So when we approach doing this
module, one of the challenges,


389
0:18:6,61 --> 0:18:11,56
I would say, is that you
want to present the learner


390
0:18:11,56 --> 0:18:13,38
with a meaningful challenge.


391
0:18:13,38 --> 0:18:18,97
But it's something that they
can see the human aspect of it.


392
0:18:18,97 --> 0:18:21,96
So one of the things that
we struggled really with


393
0:18:21,96 --> 0:18:26,87
was defining the right to
challenge to give the students.


394
0:18:26,87 --> 0:18:29,84
And not something that was
directly coming from the movie,


395
0:18:29,84 --> 0:18:33,79
so they already saw what the
student's solution had been.


396
0:18:33,79 --> 0:18:37,61
And they would gravitate
towards doing something similar.


397
0:18:37,61 --> 0:18:38,38
Right?


398
0:18:38,38 --> 0:18:42,86
So we took a challenge of
one of the teams that was not


399
0:18:42,86 --> 0:18:46,4
portrayed in the movie, was
just mentioned at the beginning,


400
0:18:46,4 --> 0:18:48,78
as one of the main challenges.


401
0:18:48,78 --> 0:18:49,53
Do you want to?


402
0:18:49,53 --> 0:18:49,656
MELISSA PELOCHINO: Yeah.


403
0:18:49,656 --> 0:18:52,8
I would say that was
definitely a challenge.


404
0:18:52,8 --> 0:18:55,49
Another challenge we
had is sort of providing


405
0:18:55,49 --> 0:18:59,22
an experiential learning
opportunity for students.


406
0:18:59,22 --> 0:19:2,65
Being mindful that teachers
need to manage their class


407
0:19:2,65 --> 0:19:6,28
and that this may not be the
type of learning and teaching


408
0:19:6,28 --> 0:19:9,5
that a teacher might
feel comfortable with.


409
0:19:9,5 --> 0:19:13,28
So trying to find the right
balance between the giving


410
0:19:13,28 --> 0:19:15,54
or delivering of
material and content,


411
0:19:15,54 --> 0:19:17,97
and the experience
that the students


412
0:19:17,97 --> 0:19:22,42
would be having, I think
was definitely challenging.


413
0:19:22,42 --> 0:19:25,11
We're in a time right
now where teachers


414
0:19:25,11 --> 0:19:28,43
were taught in a way that's
very different than we're now


415
0:19:28,43 --> 0:19:30,13
asking them to teach.


416
0:19:30,13 --> 0:19:33,31
And so being mindful of
that gap and sort of finding


417
0:19:33,31 --> 0:19:35,69
the right balance there
was very challenging.


418
0:19:35,69 --> 0:19:40,79
And how we sort of answered
that for ourselves was providing


419
0:19:40,79 --> 0:19:44,8
a lot of scaffolding
for the students.


420
0:19:44,8 --> 0:19:48,66
So, for example, we ask them
to identify a bunch of needs


421
0:19:48,66 --> 0:19:53,8
that a particular "character"
that we present might have.


422
0:19:53,8 --> 0:19:57,5
But then we present
an actual need


423
0:19:57,5 --> 0:20:0,0
that we want the whole group
to solve for all together.


424
0:20:0,0 --> 0:20:2,67
So we gave them the
freedom to sort of generate


425
0:20:2,67 --> 0:20:4,0
their own ideas.


426
0:20:4,0 --> 0:20:7,69
But then we kept it
sort of whole class


427
0:20:7,69 --> 0:20:9,5
as they move
through the process.


428
0:20:9,5 --> 0:20:11,3
Which enabled the
teacher, we felt,


429
0:20:11,3 --> 0:20:14,1
to manage a little bit easier.


430
0:20:14,1 --> 0:20:15,97
LETICIA BRITOS
CAVAGNARO: In a way,


431
0:20:15,97 --> 0:20:19,36
the resource needs
to be a learning


432
0:20:19,36 --> 0:20:22,13
experience for the students,
but also for the teacher.


433
0:20:22,13 --> 0:20:22,75
Right?


434
0:20:22,75 --> 0:20:26,44
Because we wanted if
this is going to scale,


435
0:20:26,44 --> 0:20:30,49
this is going into the hands
of a teacher who is not


436
0:20:30,49 --> 0:20:32,26
knowledgeable about
the same thinking.


437
0:20:32,26 --> 0:20:36,7
So they might not be comfortable
with being the facilitator.


438
0:20:36,7 --> 0:20:40,51
So what we did was we
took one of this students,


439
0:20:40,51 --> 0:20:42,91
Darrell, that
appears in the movie,


440
0:20:42,91 --> 0:20:47,56
is one of the water
storage team students.


441
0:20:47,56 --> 0:20:49,18
And he was the facilitator.


442
0:20:49,18 --> 0:20:53,49
So this particular module, or
one instance of the module,


443
0:20:53,49 --> 0:20:57,35
was, just as Ralph said,
just like press play and go.


444
0:20:57,35 --> 0:21:0,45
So you would have the
teacher on the screen saying,


445
0:21:0,45 --> 0:21:2,1
and now we're going to do this.


446
0:21:2,1 --> 0:21:4,86
And the teacher would be
kind of like the facilitator


447
0:21:4,86 --> 0:21:6,86
on the side, providing
the materials.


448
0:21:6,86 --> 0:21:10,1
And in a way, giving the
teacher the opportunity to


449
0:21:10,1 --> 0:21:11,55
observe the students in action.


450
0:21:11,55 --> 0:21:15,8
And seeing the interaction with
this in-screen facilitator.


451
0:21:15,8 --> 0:21:16,3
Right?


452
0:21:16,3 --> 0:21:17,47
And this is an experiment.


453
0:21:17,47 --> 0:21:22,28
We really don't know, and
we're eager to find out,


454
0:21:22,28 --> 0:21:24,84
how this works in schools.


455
0:21:24,84 --> 0:21:28,5
And hopefully we'll be able
to go into some classrooms


456
0:21:28,5 --> 0:21:31,1
and see how it works.


457
0:21:31,1 --> 0:21:32,25
RALPH KING: Leticia is modest.


458
0:21:32,25 --> 0:21:35,6
Her MOOC that she
created at Stanford


459
0:21:35,6 --> 0:21:38,14
attracted thousands
and thousands


460
0:21:38,14 --> 0:21:41,12
of students who
actually completed it,


461
0:21:41,12 --> 0:21:44,71
which also with MOOC
is not that common.


462
0:21:44,71 --> 0:21:47,99
And had some really
amazing feedback


463
0:21:47,99 --> 0:21:50,22
and experiences from it.


464
0:21:50,22 --> 0:21:56,9
And so the scaling
of design thinking


465
0:21:56,9 --> 0:21:58,54
is happening in
a number of ways.


466
0:21:58,54 --> 0:22:5,52
And these folks are
among the pioneers of it.


467
0:22:5,52 --> 0:22:8,39
AUDIENCE: So in the
movie, in the class,


468
0:22:8,39 --> 0:22:13,11
I didn't see many
design students


469
0:22:13,11 --> 0:22:14,94
with the design backgrounds.


470
0:22:14,94 --> 0:22:19,574
So I saw the professors who
are from technology backgrounds


471
0:22:19,574 --> 0:22:23,52
or from psychology background,
so I wonder how much effort


472
0:22:23,52 --> 0:22:28,26
made by design
professors or students


473
0:22:28,26 --> 0:22:29,5
with the design background?


474
0:22:29,5 --> 0:22:33,415
And how many people
have design backgrounds


475
0:22:33,415 --> 0:22:36,124
get involved into this process?


476
0:22:36,124 --> 0:22:38,84



477
0:22:38,84 --> 0:22:44,13
RALPH KING: Usually in that
course, there are a quarter,


478
0:22:44,13 --> 0:22:46,85
or maybe not quite that
many, of the students


479
0:22:46,85 --> 0:22:47,81
are from the design.


480
0:22:47,81 --> 0:22:51,32
There's a design program,
a joint program in design,


481
0:22:51,32 --> 0:22:54,3
at the graduate
level at Stanford.


482
0:22:54,3 --> 0:22:58,1
But it's part of the Mechanical
Engineering Department,


483
0:22:58,1 --> 0:22:59,3
I think.


484
0:22:59,3 --> 0:23:3,37
So there's a lot of dialogue
between the design department


485
0:23:3,37 --> 0:23:8,2
and the D School, which is
not a department itself.


486
0:23:8,2 --> 0:23:11,74
It's just where people come
together to intermingle.


487
0:23:11,74 --> 0:23:16,18
And so I'd say anywhere from
10 to 25% of the students


488
0:23:16,18 --> 0:23:19,74
had a design or were
currently in a design program.


489
0:23:19,74 --> 0:23:23,16
But they had, all around
them, these instructors


490
0:23:23,16 --> 0:23:27,669
who were very immersed
in the design process.


491
0:23:27,669 --> 0:23:29,21
But as we said at
the very beginning,


492
0:23:29,21 --> 0:23:34,4
very few had ever made
anything in their lives.


493
0:23:34,4 --> 0:23:35,29
Or designed anything.


494
0:23:35,29 --> 0:23:41,0
So I think the idea is
creating this attitude,


495
0:23:41,0 --> 0:23:43,96
that if I see a problem in
the world, I can fix it.


496
0:23:43,96 --> 0:23:46,87
Kind of forget the
whole idea of design.


497
0:23:46,87 --> 0:23:49,38
It's a kind of optimism.


498
0:23:49,38 --> 0:23:52,83
And I can figure
out how to find out,


499
0:23:52,83 --> 0:23:55,28
how to get the answer
to this problem,


500
0:23:55,28 --> 0:23:57,585
if I care enough about it.


501
0:23:57,585 --> 0:23:59,71
LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO:
I would say that students


502
0:23:59,71 --> 0:24:3,14
with a design background, for
the purpose of the D School


503
0:24:3,14 --> 0:24:5,63
are just one more
discipline that


504
0:24:5,63 --> 0:24:8,16
contributes to a
multidisciplinary team.


505
0:24:8,16 --> 0:24:10,16
But we really think
design thinking


506
0:24:10,16 --> 0:24:16,3
is a much broader language for
creating a problem definition


507
0:24:16,3 --> 0:24:17,97
and solving.


508
0:24:17,97 --> 0:24:20,12
And we are all designers
in a way, right?


509
0:24:20,12 --> 0:24:23,23
And getting that
attitude, as Ralph


510
0:24:23,23 --> 0:24:27,1
said, into every discipline.


511
0:24:27,1 --> 0:24:31,2
AUDIENCE: I would totally agree,
design thinking and design are


512
0:24:31,2 --> 0:24:32,46
basically different things.


513
0:24:32,46 --> 0:24:35,13
But I wonder, for the
students in this class,


514
0:24:35,13 --> 0:24:40,22
this Extreme class, did they
get any design skill training?


515
0:24:40,22 --> 0:24:42,88
Because during
the whole process,


516
0:24:42,88 --> 0:24:47,14
they need to do the
research, do the interviews,


517
0:24:47,14 --> 0:24:49,65
so there are a lot of
design skills or research


518
0:24:49,65 --> 0:24:51,534
skills involved in the process.


519
0:24:51,534 --> 0:24:53,2
So I wonder, except
the design thinking,


520
0:24:53,2 --> 0:24:58,47
did they get any other
training or specific skills?


521
0:24:58,47 --> 0:25:0,62
MELISSA PELOCHINO: Each
class has its own sort


522
0:25:0,62 --> 0:25:4,34
of ways that they convey
the design thinking


523
0:25:4,34 --> 0:25:7,72
process and methodology.


524
0:25:7,72 --> 0:25:11,1
So I can't-- I mean, you could
probably speak better than us


525
0:25:11,1 --> 0:25:14,71
because we don't teach
that particular class--


526
0:25:14,71 --> 0:25:17,48
but I can say in the class
that we're teaching right now


527
0:25:17,48 --> 0:25:23,5
at the D School, we do teach the
skills required for the design


528
0:25:23,5 --> 0:25:27,72
thinking process alongside the
mindsets and sort of attitudes


529
0:25:27,72 --> 0:25:28,66
as well.


530
0:25:28,66 --> 0:25:30,28
In a way that's
very experiential.


531
0:25:30,28 --> 0:25:33,29
And then they go out into the
field and they apply them.


532
0:25:33,29 --> 0:25:36,44
So there definitely is
training along the way,


533
0:25:36,44 --> 0:25:39,78
throughout any design
thinking course.


534
0:25:39,78 --> 0:25:43,33
And I would also add that
the D School is not actually


535
0:25:43,33 --> 0:25:44,25
a school.


536
0:25:44,25 --> 0:25:47,67
By design, it doesn't
issue degrees on purpose.


537
0:25:47,67 --> 0:25:51,56
They didn't want to have a
space that like the creatives


538
0:25:51,56 --> 0:25:53,74
are over here and everybody
else is over here.


539
0:25:53,74 --> 0:25:55,73
It's specifically a
place where people


540
0:25:55,73 --> 0:25:59,87
from all different disciplines
and backgrounds come together.


541
0:25:59,87 --> 0:26:2,51
And sort of one of the
cornerstones of design thinking


542
0:26:2,51 --> 0:26:6,4
is that interdisciplinary
cross-breeding


543
0:26:6,4 --> 0:26:8,15
of ideas and perspectives.


544
0:26:8,15 --> 0:26:10,76
That that's what yields the
most creative and innovative


545
0:26:10,76 --> 0:26:11,56
results.


546
0:26:11,56 --> 0:26:13,643
LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO:
And I would, building on


547
0:26:13,643 --> 0:26:15,55
that, it's a place
where people come


548
0:26:15,55 --> 0:26:19,6
for different amounts
of time and involvement.


549
0:26:19,6 --> 0:26:19,56
Right?


550
0:26:19,56 --> 0:26:24,38
So it's not like you have
a set amount of classes


551
0:26:24,38 --> 0:26:27,29
that you have to complete
to be a D School graduate.


552
0:26:27,29 --> 0:26:28,92
You do not get that.


553
0:26:28,92 --> 0:26:34,19
But students can come and take
a class and get a sense of that.


554
0:26:34,19 --> 0:26:37,57
And then go back to
their disciplines


555
0:26:37,57 --> 0:26:39,46
and apply some of that.


556
0:26:39,46 --> 0:26:44,52
Or they can become kind of like
D School junkies, I would say,


557
0:26:44,52 --> 0:26:48,52
and come and take eight,
nine classes, to the point


558
0:26:48,52 --> 0:26:52,98
that that becomes like a really
great part of what they do.


559
0:26:52,98 --> 0:26:54,76
And what they will
do in the future.


560
0:26:54,76 --> 0:26:56,94
RALPH KING: And these two,
together with Frederick,


561
0:26:56,94 --> 0:26:59,58
are teaching a class in
creativity right now.


562
0:26:59,58 --> 0:27:2,8
And for 40 spots, you
had, what, 150 applicants?


563
0:27:2,8 --> 0:27:4,3
LETICIA BRITOS
CAVAGNARO: About 100.


564
0:27:4,3 --> 0:27:7,35
We had to actually teach
the class twice this year,


565
0:27:7,35 --> 0:27:12,1
because last year, we had
200 applicants for 40 spots.


566
0:27:12,1 --> 0:27:15,56
So that's why we are
now teaching it twice.


567
0:27:15,56 --> 0:27:17,47
RALPH KING: So the
demand is just far


568
0:27:17,47 --> 0:27:20,24
outstripping the supply of
this sort of thing, right now.


569
0:27:20,24 --> 0:27:21,656
LETICIA BRITOS
CAVAGNARO: And it's


570
0:27:21,656 --> 0:27:24,43
a class that actually
is not required.


571
0:27:24,43 --> 0:27:28,3
And in some cases, it competes
with their requirements.


572
0:27:28,3 --> 0:27:31,76
So some students are
trying to struggling, like,


573
0:27:31,76 --> 0:27:33,4
oh, I want to take this class.


574
0:27:33,4 --> 0:27:36,26
But I have to take
units for my degree.


575
0:27:36,26 --> 0:27:37,13
And so what do I do?


576
0:27:37,13 --> 0:27:37,63
Right?


577
0:27:37,63 --> 0:27:42,94
So it's a great testament of
this revolution of the students


578
0:27:42,94 --> 0:27:48,5
feel this need to acquire these
sets of skills and mindsets


579
0:27:48,5 --> 0:27:50,37
to be creative problem solvers.


580
0:27:50,37 --> 0:27:53,37
And we're trying
to find more ways


581
0:27:53,37 --> 0:27:58,8
to spread that across
Stanford in different ways.


582
0:27:58,8 --> 0:28:0,68
Not just with the
standalone classes, but


583
0:28:0,68 --> 0:28:4,76
how can we embed
that in every class


584
0:28:4,76 --> 0:28:6,72
in the fabric of Stanford?


585
0:28:6,72 --> 0:28:9,99
AUDIENCE: So over the
weekend, I had the fortune


586
0:28:9,99 --> 0:28:13,509
of being at D School, attending
the Bootleg Boot camp.


587
0:28:13,509 --> 0:28:14,925
And I wanted to
totally appreciate


588
0:28:14,925 --> 0:28:17,425
the school, and
the great material.


589
0:28:17,425 --> 0:28:22,77
And not just the material,
but the peer leaders.


590
0:28:22,77 --> 0:28:23,94
I really learned a lot.


591
0:28:23,94 --> 0:28:26,32
And I totally appreciate that.


592
0:28:26,32 --> 0:28:29,272
And just like Ralph said, I
felt like I was walking on air.


593
0:28:29,272 --> 0:28:31,541
There was just so much
energy, so much creativity.


594
0:28:31,541 --> 0:28:32,403
So thanks.


595
0:28:32,403 --> 0:28:33,528
And keep up the great work.


596
0:28:33,528 --> 0:28:35,486
LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO:
Thank you for coming.


597
0:28:35,486 --> 0:28:37,71
And you probably met one
of our course assistants


598
0:28:37,71 --> 0:28:40,6
was one of the D
leaders, Ben Baldwin.


599
0:28:40,6 --> 0:28:42,92
These are students
who are now learning


600
0:28:42,92 --> 0:28:44,98
to teach design thinking.


601
0:28:44,98 --> 0:28:49,89
So we call an open call for
people to come to D School


602
0:28:49,89 --> 0:28:52,81
and go through a basic training.


603
0:28:52,81 --> 0:28:55,46
And the students are teaching.


604
0:28:55,46 --> 0:28:56,209
So thank you.


605
0:28:56,209 --> 0:28:58,5
MALE SPEAKER: I think that
was actually the perfect way


606
0:28:58,5 --> 0:28:59,0
to finish.


607
0:28:59,0 --> 0:29:0,26
So thank you guys so much.


608
0:29:0,26 --> 0:29:3,1
We really appreciate
you coming out.


609
0:29:3,1 --> 0:31:3,1
