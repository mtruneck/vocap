###379 You've been a closed book since I moved in.
###382 I was hoping to get you to open up,
###384 talk about your feelings and shit, so we'd have a better...
###388 connection.
###390 Like what?

###491 It's out of our hands now.
###500 18 months and this is how he shows his gratitude?
###504 Not even so much as a "Thank you, Auntie",
###506 or even a "Goodbye".
###508 He wants his mum. You can't blame him.
###510 I blame his mother.
###513 The degree of violence that put her in prison worries me.
###516 What if next time it's not a punter? What if it's Aidan?
###518 You're overreacting.
###520 From what I know, the gypsy father left to marry one of his own kind
###523 before Aidan was out of nappies.
###525 After that, his mother changed for the worst.
###527 Drugs and prostitution.
###530 Aidan was dragged up, passed from pillar to post.
###533 Had to fend for himself since he could walk.
###536 Right, if that's true, why would he want to go back to that?
###538 Doesn't know any better, I suppose.

###713 I get it. Me and you've got unresolved shit to sort

###719 Our baby.
###721 I'd never do anything to hurt her. Hurt you.
###725 I had to get your attention, get you somewhere where you'd listen.

###845 So this is your revenge, is it?
###846 No! I just wanted to see for myself. That's all. See you.
###851 But then I saw her. So I left school.
###855 Got a job, and saved up for this place.
###858 You needn't have bothered. Everything's perfect as it is.

###1046 Oh, yeah, me too. Packet of turkey flavoured crisps do you?
###1051 And Aidan's demise. Money isn't worth it.
###1053 What? Why?
###1055 I was thrown out my own house!
###1057 A man my age shouldn't have to put up with that.
###1060 I should be living in comfort.
###1062 Men of your age are usually out working.
###1064 I've had more jobs than Mr Benn. I am not work shy.
###1067 It's my back, you see.
###1070 I know you're not, you're fucking allergic.
###1072 This is just a blip. I'll sort Aidan.
###1074 You've done enough damage. For his own sake,
###1076 he needs to be reminded who's in charge.
###1078 He's due in court tomorrow.
###1081 His solicitor says it's up to me
###1083 whether he's packed off to a young offenders or not.
###1086 Best place for him.
###1089 You can't.
###1090 Nothing gets past you, does it?
###1093 The way you treated the house. Me and Frank.
###1095 After everything I've done for you? Is that fair?
###1098 Patty?
###1099 I could get you off.
###1101 I could persuade Frank, to keep you at home

###1145 Plum fiddler! Cock jockey!

###1149 Brother fucker!
###1150 This is exactly why I didn't say anything.
###1153 I am capable of being mates with a man without being pervy, you know.
###1158 I see you as a mate, nothing more, so don't flatter yourself.
###1162 You're not even my type anyway.
###1188 So...
###1191 Who is your type?
###1196 Go on?
###1199 Well...
###1201 Just someone nice and loving.
###1203 Who I can tell anything to and just know it'd be safe with him.
###1210 Someone who's easy to talk to,
###1212 and will always be there for me no matter what.
###1216 When I'm sad, he'd comfort me and tell me everything will be OK.
###1220 Big dick!
###1221 Yeah!
###1225 What about you?
###1230 There is someone.
###1234 Trust her with my life. She's perfect.
###1241 I'd be with her now but... it's difficult.
###1250 I know who it is!
###1252 Well, it's Sue, innit?

###1322 I want to be in Cilla's life for the rest of mine. And...

###1361 Got something to tell you.
###1363 It's about...
###1368 It's about...
###1372 It's about...
###1373 You going to keep us in suspenders or what, Mam?
###1376 It's about Cilla's dad.
###1379 We know. Billy Tutton.
###1380 Fucking what?
###1382 I only told Shane!
###1384 Nobody told me!
###1385 I've been worried sick keeping it a secret because I was ashamed.
###1388 Mimi, you shagged a 14 year old?
###1391 Did she, fuck. Mam's not a paedo.
###1392 How is Cilla Billy's if they didn't shag, dickhead?
###1395 Well, got his...
###1398 Well, she opened...
###1400 Mum, tell her you're not a paedo! Are you?
###1403 I didn't know how old he was. I gave him wanks.
###1406 And sometimes I'd...
###1409 I'd lie in bed and flick me bean while he stood over tugging off.
###1412 Argh. No!
###1413 One time he got too close and there was a spillage.
###1416 At the time, Billy warned I could get pregnant. I never thought I...
###1423 See. It was a jizz finger, that's all.
###1427 Mam, you've done nothing to be ashamed of. And we love you.
###1437 He's back. He wants access to Cilla.
###1439 No way! I'll tear his fucking bollocks off!
###1441 I'll carve him a new arsehole!
###1443 I'll murder the fucking cunt!
###1448 Electronic tag and a 6pm curfew.
###1451 How's that punishment? Human rights gone mad!
###1455 Oi! What's he doing in my room?
###1460 That's our contingency. We rented it out.
###1463 Your mother could turn up any day. We have to cover our backs.
###1467 Until then, you won't be taking the proverbial any more.
###1469 If you don't like it,
###1471 you're welcome to give your mates at social services a call.
###1475 You'll get used to sharing. He works nights, security.
###1478 So he'll sleep all day.
###1481 You won't even know he's there.
###1483 And I'm obliged to let you know he's on the sex offenders register.
###1487 Some lost in translation thing.
###1490 It's a stupid law anyway.
###1511 You have to leave, now.
###1512 The news about you didn't go down well.
###1514 They want your blood and I can't protect you.
###1515 I didn't come back, do all this,
###1517 to just run away.
###1518 Are you daft?
###1519 You can't just show up and act like everything's normal.
###1523 It's not. It's fucked up!
###1524 I'm older, I'm not a kid any more. I'm 16.
###1527 If you give me a chance, we can make it work.
###1530 I have to know I'm doing the right thing by Cilla
###1533 and without my lads on side, you can't be in her life.
###1536 You need to prove to me and them that you're ready to be her father.
###1542 And if you can't, I understand,
###1544 but it's that or nothing.

###1613 Please don't take her away from me.
###1620 What the fuck?!
###1621 I love ya.
###1624 I've been up the wall trying to get a grip of how to make this work

###1688 Well, Marty's trying to get back with Sue so any ideas?
###1692 Didn't realise.
###1693 Mainly for the kids. I mean, one step at a time.
###1697 How we supposed to put a shelf up with that?
###1700 I best get off.
###1701 I'm helping Shane with Mimi's party.
###1704 I'm really excited for you, Marty, I hope it works out.
###1707 Come tomorrow and meet my kids.
###1709 I don't want to be in the way.
###1710 You won't.
###1726 An old work mate heard where Mum is. Gave me the address.
###1729 S'cuse me, have you seen her? She's my mum.
###1732 She's got blacky brown hair.
###1734 About this big.
###1739 Ta for keeping hold of my tag.
###1742 I tried it on but...

###1745 Soak your ankle in warm water.
###1750 (SPEAKS IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE)
###1761 Either tell me now, or three glasses later when the truth juice kicks in.
###1766 I'm fine.
###1768 I was going to give Billy a chance, only he tried it on,
###1771 said he loved me, so I called it off.
###1773 That because you don't love him back, or because you do?
###1777 Neither.
###1779 Can't do right for doing wrong?
###1783 Me, too.
###1786 He's not ready anyway, he's 16.
###1788 Truthfully, when is anyone ready to be a parent?
###1796 Doesn't matter, my lads have made it clear they'll never accept it.
###1799 This is the best thing for everyone.
###1801 Except Cilla.
###1803 You're going to have tell her why you rejected her dad.
###1806 Because he said he loved you?!
###1808 Want some advice?
###1810 Grow a clit, for fuck's sake,
###1812 and stop hiding behind your boys and making excuses!
###1814 Take control before you regret it.
###1817 Don't talk to me like that!
###1821 You're right though.
###1822 She'll find out when she's old enough, then she'll hate me.
###1826 Thanks(!)
###1829 Pleasure(!)
###1833 Do him, son, do him, do him!
###1835 Yes! Kicked your arse again!
###1837 That's the third time.
###1839 Do you want another round?
###1844 I know where Mum is.
###1847 I might not agree with Patty, but she's better at this stuff than me.
###1849 Don't tell her.
###1851 Listen, when people like your mum disappear
###1854 it's because they don't want to be found.
###1856 Thought you'd be on my side?
###1857 I am! Look, I've been through it.
###1861 I were just like you at your age, 'cept... better looking!
###1866 Hey, from one mate to another,
###1868 just be careful.
###1876 Made a stew for everyone.
###1877 Oh! Grand.
###1882 What did you do, piss in it?
###1889 Lovely(!)
###1890 If I promise to be good, will you get rid of Poley?
###1892 And lose an extra 50 notes a week?
###1894 Fucked if I'm going to let that go!
###1896 Leave off, Frank.
###1897 He's making an effort, we should embrace it.
###1899 Actually, I've suddenly acquired a hunger.
###1901 I made it for tea.
###1903 Fancy any, Patty?
###1905 You're offering an olive branch.
###1907 Do you want me to accept or snap it in two?
###1912 DOOR CLOSES
###1913 All right, kiddo?
###1916 Come on, come on in, take a seat
###1918 and I shall serve you some of Aidan's lovely stew.
###1933 Tastes like arsehole!
###1935 Ah, salt!
###1937 Mm.

###2008 It's the stew!
###2011 Ambulance, please!
###2012 Poley's dead!
###2014 What?!
###2014 I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
###2017 (SHOUTS) Aidan!
###2033 What you doing out here?
###2035 I went to the airport to pick Sue and the kids up,
###2038 and they weren't there.
###2039 The bitch didn't even book a flight. I checked.
###2043 How's Marty?
###2046 He's in the flat waiting.
###2048 How can I tell him? It'll crush him.
###2077 No! It took me ages to put them up!
###2083 Fuck!
###2084 I'm sorry, Marty, I am, but just calm down!
###2087 Look, I'm here for you.
###2095 (SOBS)
###2099 Come here.
###2104 It's never going to happen, is it?
###2106 No matter how hard I try.
###2110 I've lost them!
###2115 I am not going to let you give up.
###2118 Trust me.
###2136 CHEERING
###2141 ♪ Happy Birthday, dear Mimi... ♪
###2148 Awkward.
###2149 Clear the pub. We've got some family issues to sort.
###2175 Mum!
###2182 So why didn't you come for me, then?
###2184 Wanted this place done up. Ready for you.
###2187 Wait till you see the wallpaper I've picked for your room.
###2193 You could've phoned, or a letter?
###2194 Supposed to be a surprise.
###2201 Anyway, it's not just the flat.
###2204 I needed to sort myself out as well.
###2206 Been clean for 12 months.
###2211 Couldn't have done it without Eddie.
###2216 Eddie?!
###2217 Volunteer at the prison.
###2220 Patty know your here?
###2222 I'm not going back.
###2225 A couple of days, tops, while I get your room ready.
###2229 I can help decorate.
###2230 Come here.
###2236 I've missed ya.
###2238 I'll just get you that drink.
###2245 DOOR CLOSES THEN LOCKS
###2248 No! Mum!
###2251 You don't know what I've done!
###2253 What have you done?
###2256 What are you talking about?
###2257 Left this in his bedsit.
###2259 Getting a bit fucking sloppy, aren't you?
###2263 Shane saw how stressed you were, so we put the feelers out.
###2266 Turns out the little fucker's dealing for Joe Jangles.
###2268 So we got his address, went round gave him the full Maguire treatment.
###2272 He won't be coming back.
###2273 He's...?
###2274 Ta-da!
###2277 Happy birthday, Mam.
###2280 Due on the six o'clock to Billericay.
###2283 God give me patience,
###2285 cos if he gave me strength I'd twat the pair of you!
###2289 Untie him now!
###2298 Marty likes you.
###2300 No, he loves you.
###2301 Do you love him?
###2303 Marty's like family to me.
###2305 You liar.
###2306 I'm not!
###2308 Don't insult me. I've seen the way you held him,
###2311 the way you stared at each other.
###2313 You put me up with him so you'd have a nice little excuse to see him.
###2316 The same reason why he let me stay.
###2318 The pair of you have been taking me for a right fucking mug!
###2322 Micky, whatever feelings you think I've got for Marty, you're wrong.
###2326 Believe me, Shane is the man I love.
###2329 He's the reason that you and Shane have been fighting.
###2331 Shane blames Marty, but it's not his fault.
###2334 Nothing's going on. Me and Shane are working it out.
###2336 I'm not going to interfere. It's your business.
###2339 But if you can't be honest with me, be honest with yourself.
###2343 For your marriage.
###2347 Whoa, where's the party?
###2350 Where the fuck've you been?
###2353 She's been helping me with some stuff.
###2358 Billy's staying.
###2360 And he's moving in.
###2361 Not happening.
###2362 No fucking way he's staying here.
###2364 Billy is Cilla's dad, your sister's father.
###2367 Like it or not, you have to respect that, like I did for you.
###2370 When Karen cheated and ran away with Connor,
###2375 I thought good riddance to the slapper.
###2377 But when you forgave her,
###2378 who was the only one to welcome her back with open arms?
###2383 I nearly disowned you when you came home with a prossie,
###2386 but you didn't give a shit and you stuck by her, and I'm glad you did
###2391 because Kelly's turned out to be fucking quality.
###2394 And you...
###2397 Me?!
###2398 we were mortified when you came home with a pink limo.
###2400 It's fu...
###2401 Fucking fuchsia, whatever!
###2406 I know my own mind, like you lot do
###2410 and he may not be perfect, but he's everything Cilla needs.
###2415 And I know he'll make a good dad.
###2420 And he's boss at footy, too.
###2424 There's no way he'll ever be one of us.
###2443 Billy, this arrangement is for Cilla.
###2445 You dare attempt to look sexy-eyed at me
###2448 and I'll send you back to Billericay a fucking eunuch. Right?
###2470 What's going on? It's my house, it's me son Carl!
###2475 Aidan. Where's Aidan? What happened?
###2477 Is he OK?
###2478 Carl! Carl!
###2482 Patty! Aidan pulled Carl from the house.
###2484 If he'd been there any longer...
###2486 Where is he?
###2487 Carl! Is he alive? Talk to me, son. Talk to your dad.
###2503 Didn't jump out the window, then?
###2508 Your stew didn't finish Poley off.
###2511 Carbon monoxide poisoning from his own
###2513 half-arsed effort on the water heater did.
###2517 Carl's going to be OK, cos of you.
###2532 Patty...
###2535 Could you give us a moment, please?
###2539 I'm not taking Aidan.
###2540 The boy needs to be with his mother.
###2542 I'll be good, I promise.
###2546 I'll stay in school and I won't cause trouble.
###2548 Please, Mum?
###2550 No. You've got to, or he'll have to go into care.
###2552 What?!
###2553 I'm clean, and I want to stay that way.
###2557 If I took him back, I'd be on the streets and shooting up in days.
###2560 You want me better, don't you?
###2562 Don't you dare blame him for your shortcomings!
###2563 It's true!
###2565 I wonder where my years have gone! Wonder how I'm 29 and look 40!
###2571 I wonder why my life's turned so shit!
###2575 I wonder.
###2577 (SOBS)
###2579 I'm not supposed to be a mother!
###2581 He's more than you deserve!
###2583 You are and always have been a snotty-nosed,
###2586 no-good selfish spiteful whore!
###2589 Shut up! Shut up!
###2590 You don't justify an ounce of pity!
###2592 Patty...
###2595 Wait outside.
###2597 Please!
###2607 You wasn't coming for me, was ya?
###2610 You always promised things would get better.
###2614 That you'd change.
###2617 They never did...
###2619 cos of me?
###2627 I'm better off without you.
###2644 I'll hold you to that.
###2652 Love you.
