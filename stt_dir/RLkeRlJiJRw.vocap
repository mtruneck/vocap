###59 MORGAN: Everything's bigger in America,
###63 we've got the biggest cars,
###64 the biggest houses,
###66 the biggest companies,
###67 the biggest food,
###68 and, finally, the biggest people.
###71 America has now become the fattest nation in the world.
###75 Congratulations.
###77 Nearly 100 million Americans are today either overweight
###79 or obese.
###81 That's more than 60% of all U.S. adults.
###84 Since 1980,
###85 the total number of overweight and obese Americans has doubled,
###89 with twice as many overweight children
###91 and three times as many overweight adolescents.
###93 The fattest state in America?
###95 Mississippi -- where one in four people are obese.
###99 I grew up in west Virginia,
###101 currently the third-fattest state in America.
###104 When I was growing up, my mother cooked dinner every single day.
###107 Almost all my memories of her are in the kitchen.
###110 And we never ate out,
###112 only on those few, rare special occasions.
###114 Today, families do it all the time,
###116 and they're paying for it -- not only with their wallets,
###120 but with their waistlines.
###122 Obesity is now second only to smoking
###124 as a major cause of preventable death in America,
###126 with more than 400,000 deaths per year
###129 associated with related illnesses.
###131 In 2002, a few Americans got fed up with being overweight
###135 and did what we do best.
###137 They sued the bastards.
###139 taking aim at the fast-food companies
###141 and blaming them for their obesity and illnesses,
###144 a lawsuit was filed in New York on behalf of two teenage girls,
###147 one who was 14 years old, 4'10", and 170 pounds,
###152 the other, 19 years old, 5'6", and 270 pounds.
###157 The unthinkable had suddenly become reality.
###161 People were suing the golden arches for selling them food
###164 that most of us know isn't good for you to begin with
###167 yet each day, one in four Americans
###170 visits a fast-food restaurant.
###172 And this hunger for fast food isn't just in America.
###176 it's happening on a global basis.
###178 McDonaldís alone operates more than 30,000 joints
###181 in over 100 countries on 6 continents
###183 and feeds more than 46 million people worldwide every day.
###188 That's more than the entire population of Spain.
###191 In the United States alone,
###193 McDonaldís accounts for 43 % of the total fast-food market.
###196 They're everywhere -- Wal-Mart's, airports, rest stops,
###199 gas stations, train stations, shopping malls,
###202 department stores, amusement parts, even hospitals.
###205 That's right -- hospitals.
###207 At least you're close when the coronary kicks in.
###210 Lawyers for McDonald's called the suits "frivolous",
###213 stating that the dangers of its food are universally known
###216 and that these kids can't show that their weight problems
###219 and health woes were caused solely by their McDiets.
###222 The judge states, however,
###224 that if lawyers for the teens can show
###226 that McDonald's intends for people to eat its food
###229 for every meal of every day
###231 and that doing so would be unreasonably dangerous,
###234 they may be able to state a claim.
###236 Are the food companies solely to blame for this epidemic?
###239 Where does personal responsibility stop
###242 and corporate responsibility begin?
###244 Is fast food really that bad for you?
###247 I mean, what would happen if I ate nothing but McDonald's
###250 for 30 days straight?
###251 Would I suddenly be on the fast track
###253 to becoming an obese American?
###255 Would it be unreasonably dangerous?
###258 Let's find out.
###260 Iím ready.

###321 I knew if I was going to do this,
###322 I would need some serious medical supervision,
###325 so I enlisted the help of not one, but three doctors -
###329 a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist,
###332 and a general practitioner.
###335 You're feeling quite well today, yes?
###336 In general, any fatigue or weight loss, weight gain,
###340 any change in your vision?
###342 No fever, no earache, no cough
###343 no shortness of breath, no chest pain...
###345 ...nausea, vomiting, heartburn?
###347 Dr. Isaacs: no hospitalizations for illness?
###349 Do you take any medications of any sort?
###351 Iíve just been taking vitamins.
###352 Any food allergies or anything?
###354 No.
###356 There's no heart disease or diabetes or blood pressure
###359 or cancer in the immediate family?
###361 My grandfather's had a couple open-heart surgeries.
###364 One out of four grandparents is dead.
###365 Yeah.

###368 - Any alcohol use? - Now? None.
###371 You don't smoke?
###372 I used to, but I don't.
###373 Any drug use at all?
###375 Not for a long time.
###376 - Are you sexually active at present? - Yes.
###379 - A girlfriend? - Yes.

###382 Is there anything else you need to tell me?
###384 I don't think so.

###421 Everything looks pretty normal here.
###423 Good.
###424 We'll skip checking for hernias.
###425 We're gonna do a rectal exam.
###430 I like to be more thorough than that.
###432 And I like doctors to be thorough.
###434 You're gonna go downstairs and get your bloods drawn.
###437 So, the reason we have you fasting
###440 is the true cholesterol and glucose number is fasting.
###443 So, if you had, like, a bacon, egg, and cheese
###445 your cholesterol would be way high,
###447 or if you had orange juice, your glucose would be high.
###450 Three down.
###451 Your blood tests are excellent.
###453 Your starting off with a total cholesterol of 168
###456 which is less than 200, which is really superb
###459 your blood level's fine.
###461 Your iron level is good as well.
###463 you have no evidence of diabetes.
###464 Your fasting blood sugar is very low.
###466 the other thing that we looked at
###468 were all your electrolytes in terms of salts in your blood,
###471 your kidney function, your liver function.
###473 They were all perfect.
###474 Your triglycerides, which is your building blocks of fat --
###478 basically, what you acquire from eating fat --
###481 is 43, which is low, which is good.
###484 Your general health, you know...is outstanding.
###489 Your urinalysis is great.
###491 So, you're starting off terrific.
###493 I think the worst-case scenario
###495 is that you increase your triglycerides
###498 and your cholesterol level,
###499 and if you have any he art disease in the family --
###502 underlying heart disease --
###504 you're putting your heart at risk.
###506 I expect to see an increase in your triglycerides,
###510 because that can be affected.
###512 You're at 87 now, and I think that will change.
###515 I think that's the only thing that will change.
###518 Out of everything?
###519 Out of everything.
###520 There might be some minor variations,
###523 but the body is extremely adaptable,
###525 and the kidneys will handle any extra salt you're taking in,
###528 and your liver will be able to metabolize additional fats.
###531 As far as you gaining weight, you probably will.
###535 As far as your cholesterol going up, it probably will.
###540 As far as you feeling miserable, may be.
###543 I don't know.
###545 Unless you start cheating and just order the salads.
###549 I also went to a fancy new York wellness center
###551 to meet a registered dietician
###553 who would help track my progress.
###554 Okay, let's start with getting your height and weight.
###557 Iím 6'2".
###559 I weight about 185.
###561 For your height, this is a healthy weight.
###563 I can tell you that right now.
###565 Your BMI, which is the body mass index,
###567 is within normal limits, which means you're not obese.
###570 You're actually at the correct weight.
###572 So, I should keep a checklist of the things that I eat
###575 for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?
###577 Your calorie needs are gonna be averaging
###579 about 2,500 calories a day.
###581 As far as fat goes, for 2,500 calories,
###583 you're gonna want about 80 grams of total fat in a day.
###587 The saturated fat, which is a component of total fat,
###590 you want to have less than 25 grams a day.
###593 Don't try to overindulge too much.
###595 Good luck, Morgan.
###597 Hi, there. I'm Eric Rowley, our exercise physiologist.
###600 Great.
###601 Rowley: the official weigh-in...
###606 1851/2.
###608 We'll go through the cardiovascular assessment,
###611 and then I'll be able to calculate
###613 how much oxygen your muscles can utilize,
###615 and that's also an indicator
###617 of what type of condition your cardiovascular system is in.
###620 All right, good work.
###623 Iím gonna use these skinfold calipers
###626 to estimate your body density.
###628 You're 11% body fat. that's great.
###630 We're gonna measure your flexibility
###632 of your hamstrings, your hips, and your lower back.
###635 Good, good. very nice.
###637 38 centimeters was your best.
###639 There's a basic old-school test
###641 for muscular strength and endurance.
###644 36. Good job.
###645 You're above average
###647 above average fitness for your age group,
###649 definitely, I'd say you're at a good spot right now.
###652 More than 60% of Americans get no form of exercise,
###655 so for the next 30 days, neither will I.
###658 But I'll still have to walk.
###661 How much does the average American walk a day?
###663 We have these pedometers that we put on people,
###665 step counters.
###667 You could very roughly estimate at about 2,000 steps,
###670 because 2,000 would make a mile.
###671 And we know that people that work in office settings,
###674 who drive a car to and from work,
###676 who take an elevator up to that office,
###678 may take as little as 2,500 or 3,000 steps
###681 in their entire day.
###682 If you wanted to feel physically like a lot of Americans do,
###685 then you'd limit yourself to about 5,000 steps a day.
###689 Us New Yorkers -- we walk everywhere.
###692 We walk to work, to the park, to the store.
###695 Most of us don't even own cars.
###697 The average New Yorker will walk four to five miles a day --
###700 a day!
###701 That's a lot of walking.
###703 Iíll also have the blessing of being close to a food source
###706 almost everywhere I go.
###707 I walk past three golden arches just on my way to the office --
###711 three in just over a mile.
###713 There are more Mickey D's in Manhattan
###715 than anywhere else in the world.
###717 This tiny little island is less than 13 miles long
###720 by 2 miles wide, 22.4 square miles,
###723 and packed into that area are 83 McDonald's,
###727 nearly four per square mile.
###729 There are twice as many Mac Shacks
###731 as there are Burger Kings,
###733 and there are more McDonald's than KFC,
###735 Wendy's, Popeye's, and Taco Bell combined.
###738 That's a lot of burger.

###741 but I think after a week, he's gonna be really irritated.

###750 Yes, I'm a vegan chef.
###752 Ugh. I just don't know if I can --

###855 1,272 steps.
###856 So, we got to go to the corner and we got to get a cab.
###862 The cabs are gonna add up in this thing.
###864 I can tell already.
###865 I got my scorecard,
###868 and in here, I had one egg McMuffin.
###870 I had one sausage biscuit.
###877 Do you eat fast food?
###879 Once in a while.
###880 Yeah? How often?
###881 Iíd say probably once every two weeks.
###883 Three, four times a week maybe.
###886 In France, yes.
###888 But here, no. I don't like here.
###892 It doesn't sound very...clean.
###895 And what's your favorite place?
###898 Probably Wendy's.
###899 McDo.

###901 Taco Bell.
###903 McDonaldís is pretty close.
###905 Do you ever have super sized cokes?
###907 No, in France...
###909 the small size here, it's a bigger size in France.
###915 Even the small size here, I can't drink.
###917 There are rules to what's going on here
###920 in this whole process.
###921 I will only super-size it if they ask me.
###923 I can only eat things that are for sale
###926 over the counter at McDonald's,
###927 water included.
###929 If McDonald's doesn't sell it, I can't eat it.
###931 I have to have everything on the menu
###933 at least once over the next 30 days,
###935 and I have to have three squares a day --
###937 breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
###939 No excuses.
###940 Oh, I love Big Macs.
###942 This is probably the first time in a long time
###944 that I've seen a big Mac that looks like the picture,
###946 that actually almost looks like the picture.
###949 Look at that.
###950 Big Macs never look this good.
###953 You got to come to Chinatown for the good big Macs.
###956 Mmm.
###972 You've heard about all these people
###974 who are suing these fast-food companies.
###976 Yes, I've heard of them.
###978 I think it's ridiculous,
###979 but it's the American way to sue for everything.
###985 Iíd throw the lawsuit out if I was a judge.
###988 And like I was saying,
###990 if these fast-food places can put their signs up,
###993 if I can walk by them and just totally ignore them
###997 and say, "I'm not hungry. I don't need this,"
###999 they can do it, too.
###1001 We don't have to go there. We don't have to shop with them.
###1003 we can easily go in McDonald's and grab a salad,
###1006 but we choose not to.
###1007 Now, if the McDonald's refused them service,
###1010 they'd be in court again saying, "we were refused service."
###1014 so you can't win if you try in this world.
###1017 I think there's a lot of focus on the fast-food companies
###1021 because they are mentioned more
###1022 than virtually all the other causes
###1025 in most of the articles and books and studies
###1027 about why it's a sudden epidemic.
###1030 Again, it can't be the neighborhood restaurant.
###1032 We've had neighborhood restaurants
###1034 for hundreds of years.
###1035 It can't be the foods we eat at home.
###1037 We've been eating at home for hundreds of years.
###1039 Something is very different.
###1041 I think the figure is we eat out something like 40% of our meals.
###1046 MORGAN: John Banzhaf is currently spearheading
###1048 the attacks against the food industry,
###1050 advising many of the lawyers
###1051 who are currently going through the process.
###1053 People say he's crazy,
###1055 but that's what they used to say about him
###1057 when he first sued the tobacco companies...
###1059 until he won.
###1061 I think in terms of responsibility,
###1064 it's fair to point the big gun at McDonald's.
###1067 McDonaldís is one of the biggest
###1069 but, more importantly, it is the one which,
###1073 far more than all the others, lures in young children.
###1077 They have the playgrounds, the closed, indoor playgrounds.
###1081 Many places, there are no other playgrounds.
###1083 You've got to take your kid there.
###1085 So even at 2 and 3 and 4,
###1086 those kids are being lured into there.
###1089 McDonaldís is very heavy on birthday parties.
###1091 They, of course, pioneered the happy meals,
###1094 now the mighty kids' meals also
###1095 with those little "gotta have 'em" toys.
###1098 So they get the kids in.
###1099 And, of course, the whole clown. McDonald's has the clown.
###1102 A lot of those ads appeal primarily to kids.
###1105 There's a cartoon on TV which features him.
###1107 So they, more than others, lure the kids in.
###1110 I think all of us are far more concerned about the kids.
###1114 MORGAN: Another man who is worried about the kids
###1116 is Samuel Hirsch.
###1118 He represents the two girls who are suing McDonald's,
###1121 with much advisement coming from professor Banzhaf.
###1124 Why are you suing the fast-food establishment?
###1127 You mean motives besides monetary recompensation?
###1131 You mean you want to hear a noble cause?
###1134 Is that it?
###1137 Um...
###1138 I think that fast foods
###1140 are a major contributor to this epidemic.
###1143 MORGAN: In 2000, Dr. David Satcher
###1145 became the first surgeon general
###1146 to draw attention to the obesity crisis,
###1149 declaring it a national epidemic.
###1151 Now, remember, we're super-sizing everything.
###1155 You go to any fast food store,
###1158 and they're trained to tell you to buy a bigger size.
###1161 For five cents more, you can get the super size.
###1164 Federal government will define a piece of meat,
###1167 three ounces of meat, as a sensible portion,
###1170 and that looks like a deck of cards.
###1172 Few people would be able to find this deck of cards
###1175 if they were served a piece of meat, a steak, in a restaurant.
###1178 It would probably be about four or five times this size.
###1181 One typical bagel that one is eating
###1183 that looks something like this
###1185 is going to comprise five servings of bread.
###1188 When fast food companies first opened,
###1191 they generally introduced one size.
###1193 For example, one size French fries
###1196 when McDonald's first opened, called "fries."
###1199 that size fries is now called "small."
###1202 Medium, large, and super size.
###1207 That original size is still here.
###1209 It's got about 200 calories.
###1211 but the super size is gonna pack in over 600 calories.
###1214 When Burger King first opened,
###1216 they had a 12-ounce small and a 16-ounce large.
###1220 This 12-ounce is now kiddy.
###1222 The 16-ounce is now the small...
###1224 the medium, the 32, and the 42
###1227 and this is across the board with all fast-food places.
###1230 Cars have introduced larger cup holders
###1233 to accommodate those huge 7-eleven double gulps,
###1238 which are 64 ounces, a half gallon,
###1240 and hold anywhere from 600 to 800 calories,
###1242 depending on how much ice you put in.
###1245 MORGAN: A half-gallon of soda?
###1246 A half-gallon of soda for one person,
###1248 48 teaspoons of sugar.
###1251 WOMAN: Hello, may I help you?
###1254 Yeah, could I get
###1255 the double quarter pounder with cheese meal?

###1399 [ VOMITING ]
###1416 Ohhh...
###1420 You all right?
###1422 Yeah.
###1431 I believe we live in a toxic-food
###1433 and physical-inactivity environment.
###1435 That is, we live in an environment
###1437 that almost guarantees that we become sick.
###1439 Not 100% of people become sick, but the numbers of people who do
###1443 are growing and growing and growing.
###1445 I don't believe that "toxic" is too strong a word, either,
###1448 because an epidemic of obesity
###1451 where 60% of the population is suffering
###1453 and record numbers of children are having this
###1456 is a crisis by any standard.
###1458 MORGAN: The toxic environment is constant access
###1461 to cheap, fat-laden foods.
###1463 It's gas stations that sell more candy and sodas than gas.
###1466 It's a nation where there are more than 3 million
###1468 soda vending machines.
###1469 That's one for every 97 Americans.
###1471 It's a world where people depend completely on their cars
###1474 for transportation

###1478 that we rely on machines to do it for us.
###1482 My stomach feels horrible this morning.
###1485 It doesn't feel good at all.
###1489 There we go.
###1491 Iím getting this really weird feeling right in my midsection,
###1494 basically in my penis right now, and it's just like this --
###1497 [ MAKES WHOOSHING NOISE ]
###1500 It's really freaky.
###1502 That is very odd.
###1503 Yeah.
###1504 It could be from the caffeine,
###1506 but I couldn't really pinpoint that 100%.
###1509 I have a delivery for Mr. Morgan.
###1512 $13.39.
###1514 $13.39.
###1515 I made it over the three-day hump.
###1517 You know how when you quit smoking --
###1519 I don't know how many of you out there smoke cigarettes,
###1521 but you should stop.
###1524 I quit smoking. and there's the three-day hump.
###1528 [ LAUGHING ] Three-day -- it's the three-day hump
###1532 when you quit smoking cigarettes.
###1535 If you can make it over those three days
###1538 without smoking one cigarette,
###1540 if you can make it past day one, day two, day three, you're fine.
###1544 Same thing with this.
###1546 I made it past day three.
###1548 Iím all right.
###1549 Left unabated, obesity would overtake smoking
###1555 as the leading preventable cause of death in this country.
###1558 SULLUM: I was at this meal, and it came up
###1560 that one of the people was a smoker,
###1562 and somebody else at the table started hectoring them about it.
###1565 "What's the matter with you?
###1567 "Don't you know how bad it is for you?
###1569 "It'll do this, that, and the other thing to you,
###1571 and you really should stop."
###1572 And the smoker, rather than saying, "fuck you,
###1575 mind your own business" --
###1576 Which, I think, is the appropriate response --
###1578 was abashed and defensive.
###1580 "Oh, I tried to quit,"
###1582 and, "yeah, I'm gonna try again,"
###1584 and "you're right, you're right," and so on.
###1586 At that same table, there was a quite large woman,
###1588 and I was wondering -- what if this guy,
###1590 instead of confronting the smoker,
###1593 had said to the large woman,
###1594 "what's the matter with you, you fat pig?
###1596 "don't you know how dangerous it is to be so overweight?
###1599 "Stop eating, for god's sake. And don't you dare get dessert,
###1602 and what's the matter with you?"
###1603 Same logic.
###1605 Iíd be hard-pressed to find a distinction
###1607 between those two examples.
###1609 So, one is now socially acceptable --
###1612 to hector smokers --
###1614 but the other one isn't quite yet.
###1617 So the question is,
###1618 at what point will it become acceptable
###1620 to publicly hector fat people
###1623 in the way that smokers are publicly hectored?
###1627 A secret study by one of the tobacco companies
###1631 had the ominous title -- something like,
###1635 "brand imprinting for later actuation in life."
###1639 They would buy the little toy cigarettes,
###1643 and they'd start play-smoking them
###1646 at 4 or 5 or 6.
###1647 Wouldn't even notice the pack.
###1649 If you asked them what pack it was,
###1651 they wouldn't notice it,
###1653 but the theory was that somewhere, it's buried in here,
###1656 and then when they get to the age where they're smoking,
###1659 without even realizing it,
###1660 they're going for that pack that they recognize
###1662 because it had those nice feelings for them
###1665 when they were little kids.
###1666 The same way here --
###1667 they're satisfied, it's nice,
###1669 they remember the warm feelings
###1671 of playing and getting the toy,
###1673 being with mom and dad.
###1675 It's gonna carry through.
###1679 That's why when I have kids,
###1680 every time I drive by a fast-food restaurant,
###1682 Iím gonna punch my kid in the face

###1725 One of the most disturbing things to me
###1728 is that in the last 20 to 25 years,
###1731 we've actually seen a doubling
###1733 of overweight and obese children and adolescents.
###1736 MORGAN: And this weight gain has been linked
###1738 to countless health problems later in life, such as...
###1761 In fact, if current trends continue
###1763 one out of every three children born in the year 2000
###1767 will develop diabetes in their lifetime.
###1773 [ APPLAUSE ]
###1777 At least 17 million Americans now have type 2 diabetes,
###1781 about one out of every 20 people.
###1783 If the diabetes starts before the age of 15,
###1787 you lose somewhere between 17 and 27 years of life-span.
###1794 according to the new research,
###1796 the direct medical costs associated with diabetes
###1799 have doubled.
###1800 The direct medical costs have doubled in the past five years,
###1805 from $44 billion in 1997 to $92 billion in 2002.
###1812 Somewhere in the neighborhood of about 20% of the obese children
###1818 have elevated abnormal liver function tests,
###1822 and we have now started a study
###1824 where we're biopsying these children
###1826 to see what their livers actually look like
###1828 under the microscope,
###1830 and half of them have evidence of scarring of the liver,
###1834 fibrosis of the liver, the early stages of cirrhosis.
###1837 So, when these children end up being adults,
###1840 they're going to end up --
###1842 if they don't change their eating and exercise habits,
###1847 are gonna end up with liver failure
###1851 and, well, either transplant or death.
###1858 Did you want lettuce and mayonnaise on all of them?
###1861 I think it's very, very hard for overweight teenagers
###1863 because you're always going to see
###1865 the thin, pretty, popular girls,
###1867 and you can't help but look at them
###1869 and think, "I wish I was her," or, "I wish I could have that."
###1873 And it's depressing. It makes you feel like crap.
###1878 That's just how it is,
###1880 and of course it's hard being a teenager
###1883 because you see all the girls in the Cosmo girl
###1887 are teen people, and they're all beautiful,
###1890 and you think, "aren't I supposed to look like that?"
###1894 And it's just not realistic.
###1896 It's not a realistic way to live.

###1910 It was never drinking.
###1911 Obviously, it wasn't doing drugs.
###1914 My big vice was food,
###1915 and before I knew it, I wound up weighing 425 pounds.
###1921 I brought in a present for you --
###1923 my old pants that are now made famous
###1925 in all the subway commercials.
###1927 [ APPLAUSE ]
###1931 You're welcome.
###1933 WOMAN: This is my daughter, Victoria.
###1936 She's an eighth-grade honor student,
###1938 and you're a real inspiration to the kids.
###1940 I really appreciate that.
###1942 That's one of the greatest --
###1944 I started putting my weight on
###1945 as you guys know, about third or fourth grade.
###1948 She was real tiny when she was littler,
###1951 and it's been in our family.
###1952 In fact, I had a great-grandfather
###1955 that died and was buried in a piano box
###1958 years and years ago, so it's a history.
###1960 Absolutely.
###1962 And she's been trying to maintain her weight.
###1964 It's tough. it's always a challenge.
###1967 I know as a kid, it's awfully hard these days
###1970 and kids are not always kind.
###1972 No, not at all. And I know that firsthand.
###1975 And the problem is, the world's not gonna change
###1978 You have to change.
###1979 I guess it's kind of cool to know somebody
###1981 or be able to listen to somebody
###1983 talk about actually being where I am right now,
###1986 and it's kind of hard
###1988 because I can't afford to go there every single day
###1992 and buy a sandwich two times a day,
###1994 and that's what he's talking about,
###1997 like that's the only solution.
###1999 That's what he said worked the best,
###2001 but I can't do that.
###2002 And I've tried other ways, and it's kind of hurt my body
###2007 from doing other ways that I've tried to do.
###2011 And it's kind of hard to, like, look at someone
###2015 who says, "hey, I've done it. You can do it."
###2017 but it's not that easy.
###2018 ROBBINS: Iíd been sick as a kid.
###2020 I grew up eating a lot of ice cream,
###2022 more than you can believe.
###2024 We had an ice-cream-cone-shape d swimming pool in our backyard.
###2027 We had a commercial freezer with not only all 31 flavors in it,
###2031 but all experimental flavors that were under development.
###2035 And I made myself the official taster.
###2037 I had to approve everything, in my mind.
###2040 And I loved it. What kid wouldn't?
###2042 I literally had unlimited ice cream.
###2046 I ate ice cream for breakfast.
###2048 But I was sick a lot.
###2050 And I wasn't very athletic.
###2052 I was really ill.
###2054 And I didn't feel good.
###2056 So I would kind of appease that by eating more ice cream.
###2059 You can see how the vicious cycle would take place.
###2061 One of the triggering factors for me was my uncle,
###2064 Burt Baskin, my dad's partner and brother-in-law,
###2066 co-founder of the company -- died of a heart attack.
###2069 I think he was 51.
###2071 Now, my uncle weighed about 240 pounds --
###2074 heavyset fellow.
###2076 And when he died, as a young man, I asked my dad,
###2079 "Do you think there could be a connection
###2082 between his fatal heart attack
###2084 and the amount of ice cream he would eat?"
###2086 My father said, "No, his ticker just got tired
###2088 and stopped working."
###2090 By this time, he had sold more ice cream
###2093 than any human being that had ever lived on this planet.
###2096 He didn't want to think that the product was hurting anybody,
###2098 that it had contributed to the death
###2100 of his brother-in-law, partner, and, in many ways, best friend.
###2103 No way.
###2105 Ben Cohen, the Ben of "Ben and Jerry's",
###2107 a couple years ago, had a quintuple bypass procedure
###2110 at the age of 49.
###2113 My uncle, Burt Baskin of Baskin-Robbins,
###2115 dies at the age of 51 of a heart attack.
###2118 My father, Irv Robbins, the other founder of the company,
###2121 ended up with very serious diabetes.
###2124 You can't deny these links.
###2126 You just can't.
###2128 Yeah, could I get the two-cheeseburger meal?
###2132 Okay, super sized.
###2134 Second time.
###2135 Mmm.
###2136 Thank you, sir.
###2138 Thanks, man.
###2139 BENNETT: After five days on the McDonald's diet,
###2143 what I did was I ran three days' worth of food analysis.
###2147 the needs for you to maintain weight at the 185
###2150 that you were at when you came in -- 186 pounds
###2152 was approximately 2,500 calories.
###2155 Right now you're getting almost 5,000 calories a day,
###2159 the average being 4,986.
###2161 I would love for you to take a multivitamin.
###2163 McDonaldís doesn't sell multivitamins.
###2166 Well, here's my new advice,
###2168 is just kind of minimize the meals.
###2170 A substitute for the hot fudge sundae would be the yogurt.
###2172 MORGAN: That is true, if you get the snack size --
###2175 five ounces.
###2176 If you get the regular size without granola,
###2178 it contains nearly as many calories as a strawberry sundae.
###2182 With granola, it has more calories
###2183 than the hot fudge or caramel sundae.
###2185 And if that doesn't make you think twice about the parfaits,
###2188 then how about this?
###2189 There's a big, nappy hair in it!
###2191 That's disgusting.
###2192 Iím gonna show you how we do it.
###2194 You go like this. we go... [ WHISTLES ]
###2197 look, it's long, too! did you see that!
###2199 [ LAUGHS ] Oh, that's so gross!
###2202 Only the finest at McDonald's.
###2204 Here we are at 190. 192, 193, 194.
###2210 No.
###2214 We have to stop everything. I don't believe it.
###2217 195 pounds.
###2219 It can't be. We have to redo this.
###2220 That's zero.
###2223 Second try.
###2226 88, 92, 94.
###2229 You've gained, actually, about 5% of your body weight.
###2234 Losing and gaining weight that fast is not healthy.
###2236 Do you eat fast food?
###2238 Yes, I do.
###2239 [ LAUGHING ] Unfortunately.
###2241 Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. love it, love it, love It!
###2244 Love fast food.
###2245 How often do you guys eat it?
###2247 Every week?
###2248 Oh, maybe once or twice a week.
###2250 We're gonna go hit up McDonald's in a little while.
###2253 At least two times today
###2255 you know we ain't had no meal yet today.
###2257 We was just pointing towards McDonald's.
###2260 I get the number two, the cheeseburger
###2263 with the super size coke and fries.
###2266 Super-size it up! Make it bacon, 69 cents.
###2268 That's what they say. "Make it bacon."
###2271 Make it bacon, baby.
###2272 How often do you think people should eat fast food?
###2275 I don't know if they should eat it at all.
###2277 I don't know if I should
###2278 I don't know about what they should do.
###2280 Oh, that's baloney!
###2282 It's baloney!
###2283 What they need to do is 25 minutes on that treadmill,
###2286 work out a little, do some push-ups.
###2288 If you do some push-ups when you eat,
###2291 you'll keep your weight down.
###2292 I keep my weight down.
###2293 I hit them push-ups and everything,
###2296 Keep myself cool.
###2297 who has time to do that? we have to work.
###2300 We have to take care of kids. We have to clean.
###2303 so you exercise -- you run after your kids.

###2337 In the lawsuit against them,
###2339 McDonaldís stated in their own defense
###2341 that it's a matter of common knowledge
###2344 that any processing that its foods undergo
###2346 serve to make them more harmful than unprocessed foods.
###2350 Case in point -- McNuggets.
###2353 Originally created from old chickens
###2355 that could no longer lay eggs,
###2356 McNuggets are now made from chickens
###2358 with unusually large breasts.
###2360 They're stripped from the bone
###2362 and ground up into a sort of chicken mash,
###2364 which is then combined
###2365 with all sorts of stabilizers and preservatives,
###2367 pressed into familiar shapes,
###2369 breaded, deep-fried, freeze-dried,
###2371 and then shipped to a McDonald's near you.

###2375 "a McFrankenstein creation of various elements
###2378 not utilized by the home cook."
###2388 So, for the past couple days,
###2390 which I haven't shared with everybody --
###2392 it's been a new thing --
###2394 Iíve started to have -- not chest pains, but pressure.
###2398 I feel like I got pressure on my chest.

###2497 We always ask how many,
###2498 and he holds up how many fingers.
###2500 That's it. It's always the "how many"?
###2503 It's just one for now.
###2505 As soon as I got my first car,
###2507 this is the first place I came to.
###2509 I bought three Big Macs, ate them out there.
###2513 I enjoyed them so much,
###2514 I came back about 5:00 at night, bought three more,
###2517 ate them out there,
###2519 came back around 11:00 before they closed,
###2521 and ate three more,
###2523 so the first day I came here, I ate nine Big Macs,
###2526 and it was like I couldn't get enough hamburger at that time,
###2530 and Big Macs are so good,
###2531 so I ate 265 in the first month.
###2535 MORGAN: How many do you eat a day, usually?
###2537 Usually it's two a day.
###2539 Now, last year, I ate 741 last year.
###2541 That's more than two a day,
###2543 so that means there's days I had three,
###2545 but that's because they're getting smaller.
###2547 Probably 90% of my solid diet is probably Big Macs.

###2619 The way I look at it is Cezanne was inspired
###2621 by the mountain he saw out his window,
###2623 and when I look out my window, I see no mountains.
###2626 I just see billboards and advertisements,
###2629 so I use that as my inspiration.
###2632 The average American child
###2634 sees 10,000 food advertisements per year on television.
###2637 95% of those are for sugared cereals,
###2639 soft drinks, fast foods, or candy.
###2642 A parent who eats every meal every day
###2645 for the whole year with their child
###2647 and at every meal gives a very compelling nutrition message
###2650 and can bring in cartoon characters and Michael Jordan --
###2653 so instead of selling McDonald's,
###2655 he sells oranges --
###2656 and Britney spears, instead of selling Pepsi
###2659 will sell radishes or lettuce or something --
###2662 that parents will have 1,000 cracks at their child,
###2665 compared to 10,000 for the food industry.
###2667 So it's not a fair fight.

###2776 In its peak year, the "5 a day" fruit and vegetable campaign's
###2781 total advertising budget in all media
###2784 was a lowly $2 million,
###2787 100 times less than just the direct media budget
###2790 of one candy company.
###2793 Think about the way food is marketed --
###2796 T-shirts, coupons, toys for children,
###2799 giveaways in fast-food places, place mats,
###2802 just all of the different ways
###2804 in which food marketing is ubiquitous.
###2807 The most heavily advertised foods are consumed the most.
###2810 No surprise.
###2811 Thank you. Come again.
###2813 Welcome to McDonald's!
###2815 MORGAN: Tomato concentrate, distilled vinegar,
###2819 high-fructose corn syrup --
###2822 high-fructose corn syrup and corn syrup.
###2825 That means sugar.
###2831 Iím gonna move over to my salad shaker.
###2837 I feel a little sick to my stomach.
###2840 This is the best part of the day --
###2842 when I get to be fat on the bed with my quart of coke.
###2845 Mm-mmm.
###2846 [ ICE RATTLING ]
###2853 People eat out a lot,
###2854 and so if there aren't healthy foods available at restaurants,
###2857 and there isn't good nutrition information,
###2860 it makes eating out difficult.
###2861 MORGAN: McDonald's says nutrition information
###2863 for all their products is available on-line,
###2866 but according to the 2000 U.S. census,
###2868 more than half of all U.S. homes
###2870 still don't have internet access.
###2871 So, what are these people supposed to do?
###2873 Go to the stores for nutrition information?
###2875 Is that information even there?
###2877 I went to find out.
###2883 Do you guys have any of the nutrition fact sheets?
###2885 Do you guys have one of those?
###2886 The things that fold out and have the nutrition info in them?
###2895 There aren't any over there?
###2897 Where would they be? Up front?
###2899 But they got lots of info about "Dora the explorer live!"
###2902 Let me check in the back.
###2904 That's cool. Thank you.
###2910 Just give me one second. I can't find the booklet.
###2912 You can use the one right there on the wall.
###2914 But you don't have ones you can take with you?
###2915 No.
###2916 Do you guys have one on the wall?
###2918 They only have fliers now.
###2919 We had one before. They don't put it up no more.
###2922 Why not?
###2923 I don't know.
###2925 Only half the McDonald's in Manhattan had the nutrition info
###2928 posted on the wall,
###2929 some had the takeaway nutrition charts,
###2931 and one in four had no information whatsoever.
###2934 This nice manager brought me the nutrition wall chart --
###2937 from the basement.
###2938 You don't have one that I could take with me,
###2940 like a takeaway?
###2942 Do you know when you'll have some of the paper ones again?
###2945 No.
###2946 John Banzhaf and I looked all over this McDonald's
###2949 in Washington for any nutritional information,
###2952 and then we found it.
###2954 Behind here -- you'd never see it.
###2956 It's right back there.
###2957 You can't argue
###2958 that people should exercise personal responsibility
###2961 and then not give them the information
###2964 on which to base it.
###2966 I got my chicken group.
###2967 ALEX: There's no chicken group.
###2968 That's my cholesterol group.
###2970 It's protein.
###2971 I got my protein group.
###2973 Carbohydrates.
###2974 I got my meat group.
###2975 You got meat, meat, sugar, and fat.
###2980 I officially had to loosen my belt the other day.
###2983 I had to go a notch lower.
###2984 One notch?
###2986 It was scary.
###2987 Iím an old pro at this now.
###2989 You'll get sick of this, too, though.
###2992 Your girlfriend must be loving you.
###2994 She hates me.
###2995 [ BOTH LAUGH ]
###2996 Thank you. Bye-bye.
###2998 I averaged out all the calories for the last nine days,
###3001 and you're still eating
###3003 over 200% of what your needs are.
###3006 I suggest you cut out all the liquids
###3009 that you're drinking from McDonald's,
###3011 except for water.
###3013 A lot of people, if they're obese,
###3015 and they lose 10% of their body weight,
###3017 it's beneficial.
###3018 It can be beneficial in terms of blood pressure and so on,
###3021 so gaining 10% of your body weight
###3024 maybe could be equally non-beneficial.
###3027 Here we go. Second weigh-in.
###3031 What do you think, Eric? 203?
###3033 About 202, 203.
###3034 I think you almost got 10% of your body weight gained,
###3037 so you've pretty much gained 17 pounds
###3041 in 12 days.
###3042 You better slow down.
###3044 Iím telling you, don't drink your calories.
###3047 I told him no more shakes,
###3048 no more coke, no more double burgers.
###3050 The staff here's calling you "burger boy."
###3053 It's starting to get dangerous now, man.
###3055 Iím getting nervous for you.
###3056 The one place where the impact of our fast-food world
###3059 has become more and more evident is in our nation's schools.
###3062 Can I get a shot of your lunch right there?
###3138 this is where schools turn a blind eye.
###3141 The student with the French fries
###3142 probably brought a bag lunch with real food.
###3144 The girl with the chips
###3145 is probably sharing them with someone else.
###3147 Out of sight, out of mind.
###3186 MORGAN: Barbara brown is the field representative
###3188 for Sodexho, one of the countless lowest bidders
###3191 that school districts have farmed out
###3193 the feeding of your children to.
###3195 Sodexho services more than 400 k-12 school districts
###3198 nationwide every day,
###3199 providing quality food like little Debbie snack cakes,
###3203 Gatorade, and candy bars to your children.
###3205 They also operate prisons
###3206 and feed thousands of inmates worldwide.
###3209 BROWN: Part of our position is that we're hoping
###3213 that through nutrition education,
###3215 the students will learn to make the right food choices
###3219 without restricting what they can purchase.
###3224 MORGAN: At this middle school in Beckley, west Virginia,
###3227 the school lunches don't have the flair they do in Illinois.
###3230 This school does not outsource their food service,
###3232 but they are on the federal school lunch program,
###3235 providing USDA reimbursable meals to the students,
###3238 most of which are reheated, reconstituted packaged foods.
###3241 Some days the amount of calories in each meal tops 1,000.
###3244 MORGAN: So, the USDA sends this food
###3247 for you to prepare for kids.
###3249 GLOVER: Right. Well, not all of it, now.
###3251 You've got sloppy Joe bar-b-que sauce with pork.
###3256 From the government.
###3257 Whatever happened to cooks actually cooking?
###3260 I don't know what happened. Too many whiny people.
###3263 They don't want to work hard.
###3264 It's easy to come in here.
###3266 This is the best tool we got right here --
###3268 box opener.
###3270 That's your chef's tool, the box cutter.
###3272 Open up a box, serve it, give it to them.
###3275 Let's look at the things that are actually cooked.
###3277 Here's a menu.
###3279 Mashed potatoes.
###3280 Ham. Chili will be homemade.
###3282 The chili will be homemade.
###3284 What about the tomato soup?
###3286 Campbellís.
###3287 Meatballs?
###3288 Comes in a box. You heat it up.
###3290 Out of the course of an entire month,
###3292 6 out of 36.
###3295 You're only cooking 6 out of 36 meals?
###3298 Appleton central alternative high school
###3301 is filled with students who have truancy and behavioral problems.
###3304 But they've turned things around --
###3306 not through discipline, but through diet.
###3309 We were fortunate to kind of stumble across
###3312 this healthy program as a result of some contact
###3316 with natural oven and bakery of Manitowoc Wisconsin,
###3320 and they believe in low-fat, low-sugar,
###3323 non-chemically processed foods
###3326 that are free of dyes and preservatives,
###3329 full of whole grains,
###3332 a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables.
###3335 We do no beef here at all,
###3336 and then it's the method of preparation,
###3338 where we don't fry.
###3340 A lot of baking and then just fresh preparation,
###3343 as opposed to opening cans
###3345 or thawing things out from the box.
###3347 We got rid of candy machines, soda machines,
###3350 brought in bottled water, and it was just a situation
###3353 where we saw a major change in the kids.
###3356 If you walk through these halls, and you're here,
###3358 these do not look like at-risk, out-of-control kids.
###3361 Their behaviors are better.
###3363 They seem to be more focused.
###3365 Teachers will tell you
###3367 that they get more out of them in the class.
###3370 MORGAN: Keep in mind, this is not a private school.
###3372 These are the "trouble kids" of the public school system
###3376 in Appleton, Wisconsin, that are eating so well.
###3379 and it costs about the same
###3380 as any other school lunch program.
###3383 So my question is -- why isn't everyone doing this?
###3386 There's an awful lot of resistance
###3388 from the junk food companies
###3390 that make huge profits off schools at the present time.
###3393 They don't want to get kicked out of the school system.
###3396 They want to be there to addict the children for life.
###3399 The soft drink companies, especially, boast about
###3401 how they're contributing to America's education,
###3404 but, in fact, what they're doing
###3405 is they're draining money from the community
###3407 rather than contributing money to the community
###3409 because the soft drink companies
###3411 aren't pumping those dollars into the machines.
###3413 It's the children in the community
###3415 who are getting the money from their parents,
###3417 and instead of that money going directly to education,
###3419 the soft drink companies are taking a cut of it
###3422 and walking away rich as a consequence.
###3425 We just banned soda in our school district,
###3428 and the sugar here shows you how much sugar a student will drink
###3432 in a week of just soda.
###3434 Forget about the rest of the food they eat.
###3436 And some of these companies are really opposing the ban
###3441 for reasons of that we would lose revenue.
###3444 And it's not about money.
###3446 It's not about economics.
###3448 It's about health.
###3452 Ooh.
###3453 The McDonald's Texas home-style burger meal.
###3458 That's a -- that's a local specialty.
###3460 So it's kind of like a big 'n' tasty?
###3463 Yes, except the big 'n' tasty comes with mayonnaise.
###3466 Oh, then, you know what?
###3467 I need the McDonald's Texas homestyle burger meal, please.
###3471 Would you like to super-size it today?
###3474 Oh, yes, I would.
###3475 Do a lot of people super-size it?
###3477 Yes.
###3479 Say you asked five people. How many of those five do it?
###3482 Actually, I get mostly all of them.
###3484 Mostly all of them? So you're batting about 100%?
###3487 I guess.
###3488 See that? She's that good.
###3491 Deborahís that good.
###3492 First meal inside the restaurant that I went in to get,
###3495 and they asked me to super-size it.
###3497 We're gonna keep a little tabs,
###3498 see how many times they ask me to super-size it here in Texas,
###3502 'cause Texas, out of the top 1 5 fattest cities in America,
###3505 Texas has five.
###3519 Here we are -- Houston, Texas, fattest city in America,
###3523 getting my first breakfast.
###3529 Hi, can I help you, sir?
###3530 When it comes to the topic of obesity,
###3532 many people are quick to point the finger
###3534 at various foods and food companies,
###3536 but the grocery manufacturers of America,
###3538 a Washington, D.C.-based lobby group,
###3541 whose mission is to advance the interests
###3543 of the food, beverage, and consumer products industry,
###3545 are quick to shift the focus away
###3547 from the companies they represent
###3548 and to remind everyone that there's more at work here
###3551 than just eating poorly.
###3553 GRABOWSKI: We believe very strongly in our industry,
###3556 and in other industries, I think you'll find
###3558 there's a growing consensus
###3560 that the solution lies in good education.
###3562 We have to get good information to parents
###3564 so that they can teach their children
###3566 better exercise and nutrition habits
###3568 and so they can lead the healthy lifestyles.
###3571 We don't teach physical education in schools anymore.
###3574 MORGAN: In the U.S., only one state
###3576 requires mandatory physical education for grades k-12.
###3579 It's also one of the fattest -- Illinois.
###3582 You got a heart rate?
###3583 Phil Lawler is the phys ed teacher
###3585 at Madison junior high school, home of the soaring war hawks,
###3589 the snack-ridden school lunches we saw earlier,
###3592 and one of the most well-executed
###3594 physical education programs in the country.
###3596 Supported mostly by fundraising and parent involvement,
###3599 Lawler has created a role model for instructors
###3601 and school districts nationwide.
###3603 LAWLER: When's the last time you ever heard of a science class
###3606 fundraising to get their labs?
###3608 eventually, society has to step up to the plate
###3610 and say, "This is important.
###3612 "We should have daily physical education
###3614 and equip it properly."
###3615 We have to say, "Our greatest strength
###3617 is the resource of our young people."
###3619 That's our future,
###3622 and the way we're treating our resources right now,
###3624 we're running into some serious problems with that.
###3627 Iíve always said we've never had healthcare in this country.
###3630 we've only had "sick care."
###3632 I think daily physical education is the only place out there
###3634 that's really offering a solution.
###3637 PHILLIPS: When I start the music,
###3640 you are gonna begin traveling through general space.
###3643 You will go back to your spot,
###3645 and I will tell you a body shape.
###3647 Watch out for other...
###3649 People! People! People!
###3651 [ UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS ]
###3653 Round!
###3656 Good job.
###3657 MORGAN: How many days a week
###3659 do the kids here at this school get to go to gym?
###3661 Once. One day a week. For 45 minutes.
###3665 Is that enough?
###3666 No. Nowhere close.
###3668 Not when the surgeon general recommends that, at minimum,
###3671 you need 30 minutes of physical activity a day
###3673 to maintain your weight and a healthy well-being.
###3676 So, once a week is nowhere close.
###3678 MORGAN: In 2001, president Bush announced his presidency
###3682 with sweeping education reform.
###3683 The "no child left behind" act
###3685 would now hold states accountable
###3687 for not having students who met minimum education requirements.
###3689 Apparently, we were not only the fattest nation in the world,
###3692 but we were quickly becoming the stupidest.
###3694 It may be sending a very difficult message for schools.
###3697 One of the reasons recess is being cut back
###3699 in elementary schools, as I said earlier --
###3701 that's being cut out so they can prepare for the tests.
###3704 and something I've said to a couple of groups --
###3706 we could end up with youngsters who can read but who are fat.
###3709 So we have "fat readers."
###3711 The more and more we put mandates on the school,
###3714 to be very myopic in their focus,
###3715 we mitigate against all of these other areas
###3718 where they should be devoting time and energy,
###3720 including phys ed, nutrition, health.
###3721 these are all the things being cut out.
###3723 MORGAN: Who in here can tell me what a calorie is?
###3727 [ INDISTINCT TALKING ]
###3731 Something you should watch.
###3733 [ LAUGHING ] Yeah. You got that right.
###3735 Is it the fat that goes through your, um...
###3741 What's a calorie?
###3742 Oh, Jesus.
###3743 A calorie is an increment of, um...
###3746 Ugh.
###3748 Um, that's a good question.
###3750 Most of us know what a calorie actually is.
###3753 I don't know.
###3754 Oh, wait.
###3756 Is a calorie some part of fat? Like -- I don't know.
###3760 Uh...
###3762 It's something that builds up the fat in your body.
###3765 Calories are not good
###3767 It's the amount of --
###3768 See, I don't know.
###3769 I want to say it's the amount of calories in a calorie.
###3772 I never pay no mind to what calories are.
###3775 I just eat when I'm hungry, and that's it.
###3778 If you can tell me what a calorie is, go ahead.
###3780 A calorie is a measure of the energy content of food,
###3785 and a calorie, the kind that you usually see
###3788 when you see the caloric content on food labels,
###3792 one calorie is the amount of energy
###3795 that's needed to raise the temperature of a liter of water
###3800 by one degree centigrade.
###3801 MORGAN: Well said.
###3803 Could I get a bacon, egg, and cheese McGriddle?
###3809 Hmm.
###3810 Smells like a little pancake.
###3813 Mmm.
###3815 Tastes like a little pancake.
###3817 [ LAUGHING ] Look at that.
###3819 I haven't walked a half-mile a day since we've been here.
###3822 No wonder everything's bigger in Texas
###3826 WOMAN: If you're inside, stay there.
###3828 The blizzard of 2003 isn't over yet.
###3831 MORGAN: I got my lunch.
###3833 I got my dinner.
###3835 Never have to leave the house.
###3837 Iím not gonna completely become vegan
###3839 just because you want me to.
###3841 Iím not saying you should do it because I want you to.
###3844 Iím saying you need to think about
###3846 what you believe is a system
###3848 that it is corrupt and immoral and wrong and hurtful,
###3851 but you're gonna be a part of it.
###3853 Where is the disconnect there?
###3854 Why don't you make that choice?
###3856 Why don't I make the choice to not eat meat?
###3859 Yes.
###3860 Because you like it.
###3861 'Cause it tastes good
###3863 I like bacon. I love pork chops.
###3865 Ham is the greatest thing ever.
###3868 Iím sure heroin is awesome.
###3870 Heroine and ham are in completely different categories.
###3875 Iím sorry, but ham and heroin are not the same thing.
###3878 They're not.
###3879 They're not.
###3881 I could be strung out on ham for days and be okay.
###3884 You are a little strung out.
###3886 And I am strung out on ham.
###3888 It's hard for me to watch him go through this,
###3892 I got to tell you.
###3894 I worry about his health.
###3895 He's exhausted by the end of the day, just so tired.
###3899 He gets home really late from work,
###3902 and he gets all jacked up on sugar and caffeine,
###3906 and then he crashes.
###3907 And then when we do have sex, I got to tell you,
###3911 he's not quite as energetic as he used to be.
###3914 [ LAUGHS ]
###3916 I have to be on top.
###3918 Otherwise, he, uh...
###3921 You know, he gets tired easily.
###3926 I think the saturated fats
###3928 are starting to impede the blood flow to his penis,
###3931 and he's having a hard time, you know, getting it up.
###3935 He does, totally.
###3937 It's still good,
###3938 but it's definitely a big difference.
###3940 There's definitely a difference.
###3942 I can tell.
###3948 Ugh.
###3950 I feel horrible today.
###3952 My headache's coming back again.
###3955 It feels like somebody's yanking on the tendons behind my eyes.
###3958 My body ...officially hates me.
###3963 All the vitamins that you see here --
###3966 vitamin e, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and so on --
###3970 are all under 50% of what you need.
###3972 You're getting quite a lot of carbohydrates,
###3975 and I know, clearly, that those are all refined carbohydrates
###3979 because those are coming from the buns, biscuits, hashbrowns.
###3983 And the sugar --
###3985 let's not forget the most refined carbohydrate of all,
###3988 which is coming from your milkshakes and your coke.
###3990 MORGAN: In fact, there are only seven items
###3993 on the McDonald's menu that contain no sugar whatsoever --
###3996 French fries, chicken McNuggets, hashbrowns, sausage,
###4000 diet coke, coffee, and iced tea.
###4003 Everything else -- even the salads -- contain sugar.
###4008 BENNETT: Iím telling you -- 202.
###4011 I lost a pound!
###4012 Oh, thank God.
###4014 Muscle weighs more than fat.
###4015 You might have lost some muscle mass and gained some fat mass.
###4018 I lost a pound. Let's go get something to eat.
###4023 I was feeling bad in the car -- feeling like shit, really.
###4028 I was feeling really, really... Sick and unhappy.
###4034 I started eating.
###4035 I feel great.
###4037 I feel really good now.
###4039 I feel so good, it's crazy.
###4041 Isn't that right, baby?
###4043 Yeah, you're crazy, all right.
###4054 150 over 90.
###4057 The headaches might even be hypertensive headaches,
###4060 but they're probably not.
###4062 They're probably related to blood sugar.
###4065 You might be in this hyperinsulinemic state.
###4068 150 over 110.
###4073 Your total cholesterol was 165 before.
###4076 Now it's 225.
###4077 A liver that's inflamed in any way or sick in any way
###4081 will leak some of its enzymes out to the blood.
###4085 So this is very nonspecific,
###4088 but it means the liver is sick,
###4090 and the most likely cause of your liver sickness
###4093 is a fatty liver.
###4095 Your liver is now like pat?
###4098 SGOT was originally 21.
###4101 Now it's.. 130.
###4103 And SGPT was originally 20.
###4106 Now it's 290, a more than tenfold increase.
###4110 Not good, not good, not good.
###4112 Anybody would say right now that you're sick.
###4117 If you're fatigued with this,
###4119 you'll feel lethargic with this,
###4121 you'll feel run-down with this.
###4123 If somebody were doing this to their liver with alcohol,
###4126 they could theoretically wipe out all the liver cells
###4129 and they'd be in liver failure.
###4131 Iíve never heard of anybody doing this to their liver
###4135 with a high-fat diet, but I guess anything's poss--
###4138 I don't know. I can't answer the question.
###4140 Never been done before.
###4142 No one's ever wiped out their liver
###4144 with a high-fat diet before.
###4145 Wow.
###4146 And I won't wipe out my liver in two more weeks?
###4150 I would think it would be unlikely.
###4152 I don't want to tell you you wouldn't.
###4154 My advice to you is to stop doing what you're doing,
###4157 because it's hurting you.
###4159 You're sick, and you're making yourself sick,
###4162 and you can make yourself unsick
###4164 by stopping doing what you're doing.
###4166 Iím just afraid there will be something
###4169 that's totally irreversible,
###4171 that there will be some damage done that...
###4174 - Yeah. - I don't know.
###4177 So, do they think that once you change your habits
###4181 that that's going to correct itself.
###4184 They think that everything should get back on track
###4188 once this is done.

###4212 There's a drug that is used in emergency rooms called Naloxone.
###4215 It's used for heroin overdose.
###4217 A guy comes in overdosed on heroin, comatose.
###4220 He's gonna die.
###4221 You inject him with this drug,
###4223 and it blocks the opiate receptors in the brain.
###4226 Heroin doesn't work. He wakes up.
###4229 If I give that same drug to a real chocolate addict,
###4233 a person just shoveling it in,
###4235 you find the most amazing thing --
###4237 they lose much of their interest in chocolate.
###4239 They take a bite, they set it back down.
###4241 In other words, it's not taste and mouth feel.
###4244 it's a drug effect of the food within the brain

###4288 at least once a week "heavy users."
###4291 Iím not kidding.
###4292 72% of the people who eat at McDonald's are heavy users.
###4295 They also have another category --
###4298 the "super heavy user."
###4300 These people eat their food
###4301 three, four, five times a week and up.
###4304 22% of the people who eat at McDonald's
###4307 are super heavy users.
###4309 If you look at the menu at a fast-food restaurant,
###4312 they use all of the addicting components.
###4314 They'll take a slab of meat, cover it with cheese --
###4316 cheese, of course, which is filled with the casomorphins,
###4320 the opiates that are found in the cheese protein --
###4324 and then they serve it with a sugary soda,

###4336 MORGAN: in 2002, McDonaldís France
###4338 took out a full-page ad in a French magazine
###4341 in which a nutritionist stated, "there is no reason
###4344 to go to McDonald's more than once a week."
###4346 McDonaldís corporate headquarters in the U.S.
###4348 freaked out, saying that this is only one opinion,
###4351 and that the vast majority of nutrition professionals
###4353 say that McDonald's food can be a part of a healthy diet.
###4356 So, we thought we'd randomly call some nutritionists
###4358 to see what their opinions were
###4360 when it came to eating fast food.
###4362 How often do you think that people should eat fast food?
###4364 Ideally, never.
###4365 Rare to never.
###4367 The less, the better. Zero is the best.
###4369 Hopefully, no more often than once a month.
###4372 If you were stranded on a deserted island
###4375 or if we get bombe d with anthrax,
###4377 and that's the only food available,
###4379 that's the only time you should eat fast food.
###4381 MORGAN: We called 100 nutritionists all over America,
###4384 and the results were not on track
###4386 with the "vast majority" McDonald's talked about.
###4388 Only 2 out of the 100
###4389 said you should eat fast food two times a week or more.
###4392 28 said once a week to once or twice a month.
###4395 And 45 said you should never eat it.
###4398 95 of them agreed that it is a major contributor
###4401 to the obesity epidemic sweeping America.

###4420 Iím sorry to have to tell you that over the phone.
###4422 We're all sort of surprised, but we will proceed as before --
###4425 just not at the integrated Health center.
###4428 Okay, Morgan, thanks, and I will talk to you soon.
###4432 Bye-bye.
###4433 MORGAN: Apparently, we don't put much value
###4436 on health in America anymore.
###4438 In fact, each year, we spend over $30 billion
###4441 on diet products and weight-loss programs,
###4444 21/2 times what we spend on fitness and health.

###4463 as their last hope for health.

###4478 MORGAN: This is Bruce Howlett.
###4480 In a few minutes, his stomach will be surgically reduced
###4483 to the size of a small apple in a gastric bypass operation.
###4487 People with hypertension who are obese,
###4490 about 75% of them
###4492 will get rid of their hypertensive medications.
###4495 MORGAN: Doctors Adam Naaman and Carl Geisler
###4499 will be performing the operation.
###4500 Together, they have done more than 500
###4502 gastric bypass surgeries, and with their tandem technique,
###4505 they are setting the industry standard,
###4507 completing the procedure in less than 30 minutes
###4509 and sending patients home the following day.
###4513 We have established now that the only procedure
###4518 that really cures diabetes is obesity surgery.
###4523 I went blind for a week.
###4525 Just one day out of the blue, you went blind?
###4527 I went to work, drove to work that night,
###4530 got to work, couldn't read the charts,
###4533 and I had to call my supervisor, tell her I couldn't work
###4536 because I couldn't see what I was doing,
###4538 and called my wife, had to get her to ride to work
###4540 to pick me up and take me home.
###4542 And then once I stopped drinking the diet soda waters,
###4545 got my sugars back down.
###4546 I was fortunate enough, my eyesight came back.
###4549 I didn't do that much damage to them at that time.
###4554 I think it's human nature to seek a drastic solution
###4559 only when you're faced with a drastic problem.
###4561 I drank three or four of those a day.
###4564 This is a half-gallon,
###4565 so that means you were drinking probably
###4567 about two gallons of soda a day.
###4569 It wasn't unusual, for a two-week time,
###4571 we'd buy 50 two-liters of soda water.
###4573 50 two-liters every two weeks.
###4575 And I'd probably end up
###4577 having to pick him up a couple extra.
###4579 He drinks more than I do.

###4747 Why wouldn't you just do it?

###4751 you saw these numbers, right?
###4753 These numbers are absolutely outrageous.
###4756 For the first time, we're seeing uric acid elevated,
###4760 so you're giving yourself hyperuricemia,
###4763 and the danger of hyperuricemia is gout, kidney stones.
###4767 The results for your liver are obscene
###4770 beyond anything I would have thought.
###4774 Truly.
###4775 I mean...you know that movie "Death in Las Vegas" --
###4779 Nicolas Cage, that pickled his liver
###4781 during the course of a few weeks in Las Vegas.
###4784 I would never have thought you could do the same thing
###4788 with a high-fat diet.

###4792 is that you've got to stop pickling your liver.

###4917 We need fixes, we need remedies, and we need support.
###4920 MORGAN: How much influence on government legislators
###4923 does the food industry have?
###4925 The food industry is an enormous business in the United States.
###4929 Therefore, it employs very expensive
###4931 and well-paid lobbyists,
###4933 and those lobbyists are in Washington for two purposes --
###4937 number one, to make sure that no government agency ever says,
###4941 "eat less of the company's products."
###4944 number two --
###4945 that the government never passes legislation that is unfavorable.
###4949 And I guess the third one is to encourage the government
###4952 to pass favorable legislation.

###4969 That's what we do in the food industry.

###4979 We provide a safe, affordable abundance of food

###5401 The big reason?
###5402 The two girls failed to show
###5404 that eating McDonald's food was what caused their injuries.
###5407 Interesting.
###5409 In only 30 days of eating nothing but McDonald's,
###5412 I gained 241/2 pounds, my liver turned to fat,
###5415 and my cholesterol shot up 65 points.
###5418 My body-fat percentage went from 11% to 18%,
###5421 still below the national average
###5423 of 22% for men and 30% for women.
###5425 I nearly doubled my risk of coronary heart disease,
###5428 making myself twice as likely to have heart failure.
###5431 I felt depressed and exhausted most of the time.
###5433 My moods swung on a dime, and my sex life was nonexistent.
###5437 I craved this food more and more when I ate it
###5441 and got massive headaches when I didn't.
###5443 In my final blood test,
###5445 many of my body functions showed signs of improvement,
###5448 but the doctors were less than optimistic.
###5451 I would very, very much doubt
###5453 that these numbers will return to normal.
###5455 Although it did drop, it was a small drop.
###5457 If you kept on the diet, you'd definitely --
###5460 I know that you'd probably develop coronary artery disease.
###5463 ...inflammation and hardening of the liver.
###5467 Should people eat fast food?
###5469 No.
###5470 You know, the answer's no.
###5473 It certainly needs to be very restricted
###5475 and balanced with, overall, a healthy diet
###5479 and, overall, a lot of exercise.
###5481 And there's no reason whatsoever
###5482 why fast food has to be so disgusting.
###5485 Fast food can be nutritious.
###5487 It's a cheap form of food,
###5489 and it does keep you full for a while,
###5491 so you get your money's worth.
###5493 But unfortunately, you cause some major harm to your heart,
###5496 your liver, your blood.
###5497 I wouldn't suggest you continue the diet
###5499 for a year to check this out.
###5500 I don't think it's appropriate or healthy,
###5503 especially with what showed up with your liver.
###5505 MORGAN: So I shouldn't eat this food for a year?
###5507 No, I don't think so.
###5509 We see people who go on an alcohol binge,
###5512 and their numbers go up like crazy,
###5514 but to go on a Mac attack...
###5518 and they've got numbers to show that it attacks your liver, too.
###5522 Honestly, I wouldn't have even thought about this.
###5525 But it makes sense.
###5527 Now that we have the data, it definitely makes sense.
###5530 MORGAN: Still, the impact of this initial lawsuit
###5533 is being seen far and wide.

###5538 have banned sugary soft drinks in schools,
###5541 and all-natural, healthy options are popping up everywhere.
###5544 McDonaldís joined right in, sponsoring events
###5547 that showed how health-conscious they'd become
###5549 and creating a new line of premium salads.
###5551 At the same time, however, they also masterminded
###5554 one of their fattest sandwiches to date --
###5557 the McGriddle, a pancake-wrapped creation
###5559 that won my heart in Texas
###5561 but can pack as much fat as a Big Mac
###5563 and have more sugar than a pack of McDonaldland cookies.
###5566 in fact, their new premium ranch chicken salad with dressing
###5569 delivers more calories than a Big Mac
###5571 and 51 grams of fat --
###5573 79% of your daily fat intake.
###5575 Over the course of my McDiet,
###5578 I consumed 30 pounds of sugar from their food.
###5581 That's a pound a day.
###5582 On top of that, I also took in 12 pounds of fat.

###5594 But the scary part is,
###5596 there are people who eat this food regularly.
###5599 Some people even eat it every day.

###5604 it's not that crazy.
###5606 But here is a crazy idea --
###5608 why not do away with your super size options?
###5611 Who needs 42 ounces of coke, a half-pound of fries?
###5615 and why not give me a choice
###5617 besides French fries or French fries?
###5619 that would be a great start.
###5621 But why should these companies want to change?
###5624 Their loyalty isn't to you. It's to the stockholders.
###5626 The bottom line -- they're a business,
###5629 no matter what they say.
###5630 And by selling you unhealthy food, they make millions,
###5634 and no company wants to stop doing that.
###5637 If this ever-growing paradigm is going to shift,
###5639 it's up to you.
###5641 But if you decide to keep living this way, go ahead.
###5644 Over time, you may find yourself getting as sick as I did,
###5647 and you may wind up here...
###5649 or here.
###5650 I guess the big question is --
###5652 who do you want to see go first, you or them?
###5665 Right now, you have the urge to eat something.
###5669 When it's through, if you still want to eat,
###5672 then you're probably really hungry.
###5674 Think about what I'm saying.
###5676 # F.a.c., that is me
###5678 # But I didn't use to be
###5680 # I was hot, I was hungry
###5682 # I was loose, I was free
###5684 # Then I waited in the line
###5685 # For some burgers and some fries
###5687 # Super size, that'd be nice
###5689 # Take a bite and close your eyes
###5690 # Round two, what do I do?
###5692 # I can barely walk around
###5694 # Jenny Craig, Richard Simmons
###5696 # But I still love to pound
###5697 # Hamburgers, coca-cola,
###5699 # Getting gas from too much soda
###5701 # Double double chunky chunky
###5703 # Hope this meal is never over
###5704 # The world is round
###5706 # And so am I
###5707 # Big boys, big girls
###5709 # With real big thighs
###5711 # Super size, super size, the American way
###5714 # Throw it down, throw it down, all day, every day
###5718 # Super size, super size, the American way
###5721 # Getting fat, getting broke
###5723 # Either way, you're gonna pay
###5726 # Super-size me
###5729 # Super-size me
###5733 # Super-size me
###5735 # Super-size me
###5738 # Now I can't get out of bed
###5740 # So I have to order in
###5742 # I'm a triple-fat fatty
###5744 # And I have a triple chin
###5745 # Who's to blame for the lawyer tried to settle out of court?
###5748 # Get some cash, spend it fast 'cause I'm staring at my port
###5752 # 'Cause it's sad and it's lonely
###5754 # Ham and cheese with bologna
###5755 # Large pie, stuffed crust
###5757 # A doggy bag is for a phony
###5758 # I have lost the motivation
###5761 # To inhibit the sensation
###5762 # By the luck of frustration
###5764 # Birthday cake, I stick my face in
###5765 # Turkey club with double bacon
###5767 # It's got healthy connotations
###5769 # Fast food is overtakin'
###5770 # And it's super-sized the nation
###5772 # Super size, super size, the American way
###5775 # Throw it down, throw it down, all day, every day
###5779 # Super size, super size, the American way
###5782 # Getting fat, getting broke
###5785 # Either way, you're gonna pay
###5787 # Super-size me
###5790 # Super-size me
###5794 # Super-size me
###5797 # Super-size me
###5800 if I can keep up this progress,
###5802 Iíll have 25 pounds -- 25 pounds.
###5805 That's a lot of weight.
###5806 # Kentucky fried just right
###5808 # Chicken nugget, dip it twice
###5809 # Biggie fries, enchilada,
###5812 # Philly cheese, drive-through diet
###5813 # Pack on weight, party yak
###5815 # Heart attack, back on track
###5816 # Still so fat, slim fast
###5818 # Slim slow, touch your toes
###5820 # Finger-licking, hit the border
###5822 # Pull right up and place your order
###5824 # It's your way right away
###5825 # You deserve a break today
###5827 # Super size, super size, the American way
###5830 # Throw it down, throw it down, all day, every day
###5834 # Super size, super size, the American way
###5837 # Getting fat, getting broke
###5839 # Either way, you're gonna pay
###5842 # Super-size me
###5844 # Super-size me
###5846 put something in your mouth.
###5848 # Super-size me
###5850 can I get extra cheese with that?
###5852 # Super-size me
###5853 what do you mean, 50 cents for extra cheese?
###5855 # Super-size me
###5857 I come here all the time! hook a brother up!
###5859 # Super-size me
###5860 ooh! A buffet!
###5862 # Super-size me
###5864 all you can eat, all day.
###5866 # Super-size me
###5867 is that the biggest size you got?
###5869 # Super-size me
###5870 I said I want it super sized.
###5872 # Super-size me
###5874 can I get, like, a bucket with a handle?
###5876 # Super-size me
###5877 two for a dollar? I'll take it!
###5879 # Super-size me
###5881 all I need is three more quarts...
###5883 # Super-size me
###5884 ...and another set of hands.
###5886 # Super-size me #
###5887 that's a pretty good idea.
