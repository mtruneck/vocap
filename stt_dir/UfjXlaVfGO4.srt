1
0:3:36,1 --> 0:3:37,57
How are you feeling now, Kitty?


2
0:3:37,57 --> 0:3:39,685
I'm all right.


3
0:3:39,685 --> 0:3:42,707
You lay down during the intermisson
and I'll give you a couple of shots.


4
0:3:42,707 --> 0:4:14,32
I'll lay down
but I don't want any shots.


5
0:4:14,32 --> 0:4:14,233
Telegram for you, Kitty.
For God's sake, give me.


6
0:4:14,233 --> 0:4:16,149
Nothing serious, I hope, Kitty.


7
0:4:16,149 --> 0:4:19,78
No, it's nothing.


8
0:4:19,78 --> 0:4:21,79
Kitty, Kitty.


9
0:4:21,79 --> 0:4:31,1
There's more. The one and only.
Take it easy, boys.


10
0:4:31,1 --> 0:4:36,68
Hey, boys, don't forget.
At the conclusion of tonight's performance...


11
0:4:36,68 --> 0:4:38,435
Hey, is there a doctor in the house?


12
0:4:38,435 --> 0:4:42,13
No foolin, boys.
Is there a doctor in the house?


13
0:4:42,13 --> 0:4:44,149
All right, What's the answer to that?


14
0:4:44,149 --> 0:4:46,791
Is Dr. Leonard here?
Is Dr. Leonard here?


15
0:4:46,791 --> 0:4:51,968
Leonard! Leonard!
Doctor Leonard!


16
0:4:51,968 --> 0:4:53,902
Doctor Leonard.


17
0:4:53,902 --> 0:4:56,209
Doctor Leonard.


18
0:4:56,209 --> 0:4:57,53
What do you want?


19
0:4:57,53 --> 0:5:0,257
Come backstage, doc.
Make it snappy.


20
0:5:0,257 --> 0:5:6,366
Hey doc, how did you ever get away
from the office?


21
0:5:6,366 --> 0:5:7,714
Right this way, doctor.


22
0:5:7,714 --> 0:5:9,577
All of you on the other side of the stage.


23
0:5:9,577 --> 0:5:13,397
I'll take you to the dressing room.


24
0:5:13,397 --> 0:5:17,229
Stay in your pallet.
No, no, right of center door.


25
0:5:17,229 --> 0:5:19,807
That's right.


26
0:5:19,807 --> 0:5:22,16
Oh, I don't get clothes.


27
0:5:22,16 --> 0:5:26,639
Go on to your dressing-room, quick!


28
0:5:26,639 --> 0:5:28,289
Something she ate?


29
0:5:28,289 --> 0:5:31,554
No, she hasn't been feeling so good
for a couple of days.


30
0:5:31,554 --> 0:5:35,38
And then when we came off this number
she got this telegram and passed out.


31
0:5:35,38 --> 0:5:37,183
What's it all about?


32
0:5:37,183 --> 0:5:38,122
It's from her husband.


33
0:5:38,122 --> 0:5:43,604
He got sent up for croaking a big bum
with an itch for Kitty.


34
0:5:43,604 --> 0:5:47,169
Eddie was a swell fellow.
But he didn't belong to this racket.


35
0:5:47,169 --> 0:5:49,608
Crazy about Kitty.
Jealous of everybody.


36
0:5:49,608 --> 0:5:51,968
But that's no way to be
in the Burlesque game.


37
0:5:51,968 --> 0:5:54,835
No, I guess not.
Gee, it's tough on Kitty, though.


38
0:5:54,835 --> 0:5:57,59
Will she be able to go on again tonight, doc?
No, sir.


39
0:5:57,59 --> 0:5:59,9
Nor for many an acts to come.


40
0:5:59,9 --> 0:6:2,333
Send one of the boys across the street
for my surgical bag, will you?


41
0:6:2,333 --> 0:6:4,34
Sure.
Is there anything very serious?


42
0:6:4,34 --> 0:6:6,332
No, not if we work fast.


43
0:6:6,332 --> 0:6:21,748
Hey, you.
Come in here. I'll need you.


44
0:6:21,748 --> 0:6:23,205
On stage everybody.


45
0:6:23,205 --> 0:6:27,404
Step on it.
Come on, get on there.


46
0:6:27,404 --> 0:7:2,668
Hurry up, Joe.
It's your entrance.


47
0:7:2,668 --> 0:7:3,614
Well, Maude Adams?


48
0:7:3,614 --> 0:7:7,555
How about getting out there
and giving the cast a little of your time, eh?


49
0:7:7,555 --> 0:7:12,107
What's the matter with you?
You're not getting out there?


50
0:7:12,107 --> 0:7:13,921
Kitty's got a baby.


51
0:7:13,921 --> 0:7:17,69
Well I'll be.
She's got a baby.


52
0:7:17,69 --> 0:7:20,354
Kitty's got a baby.
Kitty's got a baby.


53
0:7:20,354 --> 0:7:23,328
Kitty's got a baby.
Oh, Kitty's got a baby.


54
0:7:23,328 --> 0:7:26,482
Kitty's got a baby.
Kitty's got a baby.


55
0:7:26,482 --> 0:8:3,808
What?
Oh, boy!


56
0:8:3,808 --> 0:8:19,4
Come on in, boys and girls,
we got company.


57
0:8:19,4 --> 0:8:25,78
Gee, Kitty, the baby looks great.


58
0:8:25,78 --> 0:8:27,74
Oh, isn't it cute?


59
0:8:27,74 --> 0:8:29,751
It looks just like Kitty.


60
0:8:29,751 --> 0:9:0,37
Oh, what a beautiful baby!


61
0:9:0,37 --> 0:9:2,17
Watch that left foot there, precious.


62
0:9:2,17 --> 0:9:6,905
That's right. That's fine.
That's momma's big girl.


63
0:9:6,905 --> 0:9:15,746
Come in.
Uncle Joe!


64
0:9:15,746 --> 0:9:18,983
Well, how's my best girl today?
Fine.


65
0:9:18,983 --> 0:9:21,606
Now, Kitty, I got good news.


66
0:9:21,606 --> 0:9:23,345
Just came from Maxmount's office


67
0:9:23,345 --> 0:9:26,13
And you and the Highflying Company is all set.


68
0:9:26,13 --> 0:9:28,1
Thirty weeks date,
 you open in Toledo.


69
0:9:28,1 --> 0:9:29,469
Did you make it plain about my billing?


70
0:9:29,469 --> 0:9:32,416
Oh, yeah.
He came through without a squawk.


71
0:9:32,416 --> 0:9:36,834
And as for you, Snoops,
look what I got for you.


72
0:9:36,834 --> 0:9:38,952
From one comic to another.


73
0:9:38,952 --> 0:9:42,261
Mommy, look!
Oh, Joe, that's swell.


74
0:9:42,261 --> 0:9:53,313
Come on, little monkey, you run over there.
Try'em on, see how they look.


75
0:9:53,313 --> 0:9:56,75
Listen, Kitty, I've been thinking a lot
lately about you.


76
0:9:56,75 --> 0:9:59,62
What you two need is a man like me
to take care of you.


77
0:9:59,62 --> 0:10:2,521
Kitty Darling don't need any man
to take care of her.


78
0:10:2,521 --> 0:10:4,62
Ain't she getting along pretty well
without one now?


79
0:10:4,62 --> 0:10:9,525
If you'd leave it to me I'd buy a cosy little home
some place for you, Nicky.


80
0:10:9,525 --> 0:10:11,144
where she could grow up right.


81
0:10:11,144 --> 0:10:14,908
A home for me, eh?
You want lumps growing on me, I suppose.


82
0:10:14,908 --> 0:10:20,44
No, Mr. King, I got plans.
I'm headed straight for Broadway, the big time.


83
0:10:20,44 --> 0:10:23,259
No foolin', Kitty. The kid deserves a better break.


84
0:10:23,259 --> 0:10:25,683
Why, this burlesque racket
is no place for her.


85
0:10:25,683 --> 0:10:27,903
I can take plenty care of her, thanks.


86
0:10:27,903 --> 0:10:29,106
Yeah, I know.


87
0:10:29,106 --> 0:10:32,593
But she's getting to the age
where she's learning things whether you like it or not.


88
0:10:32,593 --> 0:10:35,324
Why, last night I overheard her trying to tell the one


89
0:10:35,324 --> 0:10:38,74
that the girls brought back from
the elf's backyard.


90
0:10:38,74 --> 0:10:42,55
Look. Look.


91
0:10:42,55 --> 0:10:43,648
You see what I mean?


92
0:10:43,648 --> 0:10:47,199
Yes, maybe you're right.
But, Joe, what can I do?


93
0:10:47,199 --> 0:10:52,666
Listen, I got a cousin that'll send your kid
to a nice school in Wisconsin. A convent.


94
0:10:52,666 --> 0:10:56,103
Take April away from me?
The Blessed Heart. She said it was great.


95
0:10:56,103 --> 0:10:59,105
Oh, no, Joe. I couldn't.
I couldn't. I'd die.


96
0:10:59,105 --> 0:11:1,392
It's for her own good, Kitty. Honest.


97
0:11:1,392 --> 0:11:3,84
She'd get an education.


98
0:11:3,84 --> 0:11:7,342
Grow up at a nice place.
Not in some lousy burlesque theater.


99
0:11:7,342 --> 0:11:11,923
No sleeper jumps and none of the small town johns
hanging around at nights.


100
0:11:11,923 --> 0:11:16,301
And there'll be sisters there
to teach her the word of God.


101
0:11:16,301 --> 0:11:19,662
And she'd grow up in a nice place,
grow up to be a lady.


102
0:11:19,662 --> 0:11:23,421
not a cheap little tot.
You want April to be a lady, don't you?


103
0:11:23,421 --> 0:11:26,734
You bet she's gonna be a lady.
I got plans for her.


104
0:11:26,734 --> 0:11:28,403
Then you'd better send her to that convent.


105
0:11:28,403 --> 0:11:34,503
Maybe I will.
Maybe I will.


106
0:11:34,503 --> 0:11:37,15
Let us contemplate in its mystery


107
0:11:37,15 --> 0:11:39,296
how our Lord, Jesus Christ


108
0:11:39,296 --> 0:11:41,448
being sentenced to die


109
0:11:41,448 --> 0:11:45,682
bore with great patience
the cross which was laid upon him


110
0:11:45,682 --> 0:11:48,449
for his greater torment and ignominy.


111
0:11:48,449 --> 0:11:53,745
And now, April,  there's a little prayer
that goes with this, dear.


112
0:11:53,745 --> 0:11:55,79
It goes like this.


113
0:11:55,79 --> 0:12:0,625
Oh, Holy Virgin, example of patience.


114
0:12:0,625 --> 0:12:4,49
by the most painful carrying of the cross


115
0:12:4,49 --> 0:12:9,907
on which thy son, our Lord Jesus Christ,


116
0:12:9,907 --> 0:12:12,897
bore the heavy weight of our sins,


117
0:12:12,897 --> 0:12:18,61
obtain for us of Him,
by thy intersession,


118
0:12:18,61 --> 0:12:21,648
courage and strength


119
0:12:21,648 --> 0:12:24,148
to follow His steps


120
0:12:24,148 --> 0:12:30,79
And bear our cross after Him
to the end of our lives,


121
0:12:30,79 --> 0:12:34,159
Amen.


122
0:12:34,159 --> 0:12:38,676
I know he loves me,
heaven knows why


123
0:12:38,676 --> 0:12:43,764
And when he tells me
he can't live without me


124
0:12:43,764 --> 0:12:48,181
what wouldn't I do for that man?


125
0:12:48,181 --> 0:12:50,68
He's not an angel or saint,


126
0:12:50,68 --> 0:12:55,648
I know he loves me, heaven knows why


127
0:12:55,648 --> 0:13:0,77
and when he tells me
he can't live without me


128
0:13:0,77 --> 0:13:4,136
what wouldn't I do for that man?


129
0:13:4,136 --> 0:13:9,305
I'll never leave him alone,
I'll make his troubles my own


130
0:13:9,305 --> 0:13:13,918
With all his faults I know we'll get by


131
0:13:13,918 --> 0:13:19,815
I'm just no good when his arms are about me


132
0:13:19,815 --> 0:13:24,632
what wouldn't I do for that man?


133
0:13:24,632 --> 0:13:38,702
what wouldn't I do for that man?


134
0:13:38,702 --> 0:13:39,809
Give me air.


135
0:13:39,809 --> 0:13:43,11
After that one I'd better get out of here
while I'm still alive.


136
0:13:43,11 --> 0:13:45,637
Come on, Hitch, stick around.
It's early.


137
0:13:45,637 --> 0:13:48,227
I can't, Peggy. Honest.
Kitty'll be sore.


138
0:13:48,227 --> 0:13:50,753
Anybody'd think she got a mortgage on you.


139
0:13:50,753 --> 0:13:52,272
You see that rock?


140
0:13:52,272 --> 0:13:55,66
As long as she keeps kicking in
with little love tokens like that, sweetness,


141
0:13:55,66 --> 0:13:58,619
I'm gonna keep right on being her wide-bedded boy.


142
0:13:58,619 --> 0:13:59,94
Okay, big boy.


143
0:13:59,94 --> 0:14:4,702
As long as she doesn't get wise that you're giving
the runaround with every dame in the coop.


144
0:14:4,702 --> 0:14:6,816
When she does, I'll get me a new mama, peaches.


145
0:14:6,816 --> 0:14:9,374
And your name's right on top of the list.


146
0:14:9,374 --> 0:14:17,868
Aw, baloney.


147
0:14:17,868 --> 0:14:20,569
I loved that man from the start


148
0:14:20,569 --> 0:14:24,1
and way down deep in my heart


149
0:14:24,1 --> 0:14:29,8
I know he loves me,
heaven knows why


150
0:14:29,8 --> 0:14:35,894
and when he tells me he can't
live without me


151
0:14:35,894 --> 0:14:38,626
What wouldn't I do...
Hello, beautiful!


152
0:14:38,626 --> 0:14:41,223
Gee, you gave me a start.
Ain't you home early?


153
0:14:41,223 --> 0:14:42,816
Well, I dumped the gang, luscious.


154
0:14:42,816 --> 0:14:44,96
Had to come home to my big blonde mama.


155
0:14:44,96 --> 0:14:47,9
Oh, honey.
My own sweet boy.


156
0:14:47,9 --> 0:14:50,942
What's all that stuff?
Forget-me-nots?


157
0:14:50,942 --> 0:14:52,93
Just a lot of old letters and junk.


158
0:14:52,93 --> 0:14:54,924
Hey, what john wrote your loads?


159
0:14:54,924 --> 0:14:57,294
You ain't the first good-looking guy
in my life.


160
0:14:57,294 --> 0:14:58,656
But the last, eh?


161
0:14:58,656 --> 0:15:0,357
Who's the dame?
Give me that.


162
0:15:0,357 --> 0:15:2,178
Wait a minute, can't you?


163
0:15:2,178 --> 0:15:5,499
What's the rush?


164
0:15:5,499 --> 0:15:6,467
Cute kid.


165
0:15:6,467 --> 0:15:9,525
Sister?
To my own darling mama.


166
0:15:9,525 --> 0:15:10,909
Give me that.
Hey!


167
0:15:10,909 --> 0:15:13,8
What's that mean "To my own darling mama", eh?


168
0:15:13,8 --> 0:15:14,361
You can read, can't you?


169
0:15:14,361 --> 0:15:17,537
You mean to tell me this kid's yours?


170
0:15:17,537 --> 0:15:19,488
Well, is it?
Well, what if she is?


171
0:15:19,488 --> 0:15:21,225
You've been holding out on me.


172
0:15:21,225 --> 0:15:24,775
Shut up. You're all alike.
Just a lot of dirty double-crossing broads.


173
0:15:24,775 --> 0:15:26,226
How old is the kid?


174
0:15:26,226 --> 0:15:28,96
Seventeen.
Where's she at?


175
0:15:28,96 --> 0:15:29,7
In school. In a convent.


176
0:15:29,7 --> 0:15:31,133
That's a laugh. What for?


177
0:15:31,133 --> 0:15:34,694
I got plans for her.
I want her to have an education.


178
0:15:34,694 --> 0:15:37,339
Yeah, but I always thought those joints
were so expensive.


179
0:15:37,339 --> 0:15:40,172
I manage to round up a coin every month.


180
0:15:40,172 --> 0:15:42,713
So that's where all your spare cash goes.


181
0:15:42,713 --> 0:15:44,825
No wonder you didn't have 100 bucks
to loan me Monday.


182
0:15:44,825 --> 0:15:46,757
But when I do have it to loan,
what do you do with it?


183
0:15:46,757 --> 0:15:48,288
Drop it in some bookie's lap.


184
0:15:48,288 --> 0:15:50,152
Well, I'm not thinking of myself
so much now, see?


185
0:15:50,152 --> 0:15:51,632
But you oughta be sore if I go away.


186
0:15:51,632 --> 0:15:53,2
Sure, you got a great career.


187
0:15:53,2 --> 0:15:55,803
But it takes plenty of jack as well as
talent to make the grade.


188
0:15:55,803 --> 0:15:58,168
I got plenty of both, I guess.


189
0:15:58,168 --> 0:16:2,525
Speaking of that, how about that act of ours
you said the Keith Office was interested in?


190
0:16:2,525 --> 0:16:3,913
There you are, you see?


191
0:16:3,913 --> 0:16:6,411
That's gonna cost about $1200 to mount.


192
0:16:6,411 --> 0:16:9,444
Classy looking props, three changes for you, orchestrations


193
0:16:9,444 --> 0:16:11,333
and I'll bet you ain't got $1200.


194
0:16:11,333 --> 0:16:14,196
Maybe not. But you said you'd help, remember?


195
0:16:14,196 --> 0:16:16,28
Now, that ring I gave you.


196
0:16:16,28 --> 0:16:18,404
I knew that was coming.


197
0:16:18,404 --> 0:16:19,697
Hawk it, eh?


198
0:16:19,697 --> 0:16:21,75
That's all the sentiment you got in ya.


199
0:16:21,75 --> 0:16:24,33
Hawk that new overcoat
you got me too, I suppose.


200
0:16:24,33 --> 0:16:26,434
No, I want you to look nice.


201
0:16:26,434 --> 0:16:27,888
Yeah, well...


202
0:16:27,888 --> 0:16:31,512
I guess I'm gonna be the little old excess baggage
around here from now on.


203
0:16:31,512 --> 0:16:34,137
I can see you've been playing me
for a sucker.


204
0:16:34,137 --> 0:16:37,64
Just a goodtime pal to keep you
from getting lonesome on sleeper-jumps.


205
0:16:37,64 --> 0:16:40,997
I've been nuts about you.
But I'm wise now.


206
0:16:40,997 --> 0:16:42,533
Hitch, what are you driving at?


207
0:16:42,533 --> 0:16:44,605
I guess I got sense enough to know when I'm through.


208
0:16:44,605 --> 0:16:46,3
You're not walking out on me?


209
0:16:46,3 --> 0:16:48,183
What do you expect me to do
after the deal you've given me?


210
0:16:48,183 --> 0:16:50,416
What deal, honey,
what are you talking about?


211
0:16:50,416 --> 0:16:54,585
When we made our bargain it was gonna be 50/50
and no holding out on each other, right?


212
0:16:54,585 --> 0:16:57,729
Now what? I find out you got a kid seventeen
and you've been blowing your dough up.


213
0:16:57,729 --> 0:17:0,17
Dough we need for ourselves,
for our future, for your career.


214
0:17:0,17 --> 0:17:2,87
What can I do, she's my daughter, ain't she?


215
0:17:2,87 --> 0:17:3,937
I'll tell you what you can do.


216
0:17:3,937 --> 0:17:6,209
You don't have to keep her
in some expensive dump like that, do you?


217
0:17:6,209 --> 0:17:8,453
Now get the kid down here.
Take her out of school?


218
0:17:8,453 --> 0:17:10,393
Make her go to work.
She's old enough.


219
0:17:10,393 --> 0:17:13,286
I wanna keep my baby out of show business.


220
0:17:13,286 --> 0:17:16,64
Okay, Kitty, that's my answer.
Wait a second. Give me time to think.


221
0:17:16,64 --> 0:17:19,654
There ain't nothing to think about.
It's her or me. That's flat.


222
0:17:19,654 --> 0:17:23,191
All right,
if you think that's the right thing to do.


223
0:17:23,191 --> 0:17:25,871
Why, sure it is, babes.


224
0:17:25,871 --> 0:17:27,859
It's time you did something for yourself


225
0:17:27,859 --> 0:17:30,561
instead of dishing out the gravy
for someone else like you do.


226
0:17:30,561 --> 0:17:34,4
One thing no, Hitch.
She ain't going in to show business.


227
0:17:34,4 --> 0:17:35,825
I'll get her a job outside some place.


228
0:17:35,825 --> 0:17:39,89
Okay, Kitty, just so long
as she holds up our own name.


229
0:17:39,89 --> 0:17:42,69
Now you sit right down here
and write her a little letter.


230
0:17:42,69 --> 0:17:44,78
Now, Hitch, don't be cross at me,


231
0:17:44,78 --> 0:17:47,214
but don't you think we oughta think
this over a little?


232
0:17:47,214 --> 0:17:50,72
Honest, the way you rush me
into things sometimes...


233
0:17:50,72 --> 0:17:51,925
Will you just stop fussing and write to her?


234
0:17:51,925 --> 0:17:54,853
You've been saving and scrimping all your life
to keep this jane in school.


235
0:17:54,853 --> 0:17:56,479
Now it's her turn to do something for you.


236
0:17:56,479 --> 0:17:58,695
Help you put away a little money
for a rainy day, right?


237
0:17:58,695 --> 0:18:1,991
Oh, I don't know...
You got a great career, babes.


238
0:18:1,991 --> 0:18:4,564
She oughta be proud to help you,
proud to be Kitty Darling's daughter, right?


239
0:18:4,564 --> 0:18:8,861
Why, I know so.
She ain't as good looking as her ma...


240
0:18:8,861 --> 0:18:11,14
maybe she takes after her old man.


241
0:18:11,14 --> 0:18:14,79
Instead you can depend on me, Kitty baby,
to treat her right for your sake.


242
0:18:14,79 --> 0:18:18,85
Why, we'll just be one big happy family.


243
0:18:18,85 --> 0:18:22,66
One big happy family.


244
0:18:22,66 --> 0:18:25,124
May God's love and kindness guide you.


245
0:18:25,124 --> 0:18:29,11
As you go forth
into the great world outside these gates...


246
0:18:29,11 --> 0:18:32,469
and keep you from all harm


247
0:18:32,469 --> 0:18:35,909
till we meet again.


248
0:18:35,909 --> 0:18:38,453
That is my prayer for you.


249
0:18:38,453 --> 0:18:40,125
Little angel.


250
0:18:40,125 --> 0:22:22,279
Goodbye.


251
0:22:22,279 --> 0:22:23,845
Looking for somebody, honey?


252
0:22:23,845 --> 0:22:25,985
Yes, I...
Mr. Greeley.


253
0:22:25,985 --> 0:22:27,358
Mr. Greeley.


254
0:22:27,358 --> 0:22:29,125
Cash customer.


255
0:22:29,125 --> 0:22:32,168
I'm supposed to meet my mother here,
Miss Darling.


256
0:22:32,168 --> 0:22:34,7
Oh, so you're Kitty Darling's little girl, eh?


257
0:22:34,7 --> 0:22:37,161
Well, I'm a couple of cockeyed sewing sewers.


258
0:22:37,161 --> 0:22:38,451
My name's Eddy Vermont.


259
0:22:38,451 --> 0:22:41,116
I'm in the merry-merry too.
One of your momma's best pals.


260
0:22:41,116 --> 0:22:44,5
Put it back here.
How do you do, Mr. Vermont?


261
0:22:44,5 --> 0:22:45,836
Your ma is up at the theater.


262
0:22:45,836 --> 0:22:48,197
She wants you to wait upstairs till she gets back.


263
0:22:48,197 --> 0:22:51,133
Oh, how long will I have to wait
to see her?


264
0:22:51,133 --> 0:22:52,492
Not more than an hour or so.


265
0:22:52,492 --> 0:22:54,692
These uptown grind joints get out early.


266
0:22:54,692 --> 0:22:56,233
I'll show you to the rooms.


267
0:22:56,233 --> 0:22:58,89
Thank you.
You got a great ma, Miss Darling.


268
0:22:58,89 --> 0:23:0,281
And believe me, she sure knows her stuff.


269
0:23:0,281 --> 0:23:3,721
That Swedish movement of hers
has been laying'em in the aisles ever since I was a pup.


270
0:23:3,721 --> 0:23:4,907
Swedish movement?


271
0:23:4,907 --> 0:23:6,933
I mean the way Kitty slams over her number.


272
0:23:6,933 --> 0:23:11,426
And boy, she packs the meanest strip and teaser routine
that ever burned a Verona way.


273
0:23:11,426 --> 0:23:13,427
You know what I mean.
Not exactly.


274
0:23:13,427 --> 0:23:16,373
I haven't seen my mother
on the stage since I was five.


275
0:23:16,373 --> 0:23:18,831
No?
But I remember she was wonderful.


276
0:23:18,831 --> 0:23:21,166
I'll say so.
Say, I got a bright idea.


277
0:23:21,166 --> 0:23:22,842
Instead of hanging around this dump,


278
0:23:22,842 --> 0:23:25,869
why don't you grab the Lexington Ave. local
and go up and catch the show?


279
0:23:25,869 --> 0:23:28,526
Do you really think I could?
Sure.


280
0:23:28,526 --> 0:23:30,32
I can't take you myself,
I have a heavy date.


281
0:23:30,32 --> 0:23:32,329
But my kid brother, Slim,
he'll take you.


282
0:23:32,329 --> 0:23:33,496
He's a nice guy, too.


283
0:23:33,496 --> 0:23:35,357
Okay with you?
Yes.


284
0:23:35,357 --> 0:23:39,7
All right, I'll get him right down.


285
0:23:39,7 --> 0:23:41,72
512, sweetheart.


286
0:23:41,72 --> 0:23:44,661
Slim? Come right down.
I got a job for you.


287
0:23:44,661 --> 0:24:13,769
Yeah, yeah.


288
0:24:13,769 --> 0:24:16,533
Sorry the seats ain't so hot
but the show's almost over.


289
0:24:16,533 --> 0:24:19,101
Sit down!


290
0:24:19,101 --> 0:24:46,111
What are you looking at, punk?


291
0:24:46,111 --> 0:24:49,135
We oughta pension off
that faded old blonde.


292
0:24:49,135 --> 0:26:21,786
Yeah, she's all worked up anyway,
look at that.


293
0:26:21,786 --> 0:26:23,722
Let's go away from here, please.


294
0:26:23,722 --> 0:26:25,345
Okay, I'll take you back to your ma.


295
0:26:25,345 --> 0:26:48,6
All right.


296
0:26:48,6 --> 0:26:55,633
All right, tag along this side.


297
0:26:55,633 --> 0:26:56,776
Mommy!


298
0:26:56,776 --> 0:26:58,782
April, baby!


299
0:26:58,782 --> 0:27:0,5
I don't know whether I done right
bringing her up here, Kitty.


300
0:27:0,5 --> 0:27:2,459
but she was all harped up in seeing you.


301
0:27:2,459 --> 0:27:4,129
We thought it would be a nice surprise.


302
0:27:4,129 --> 0:27:6,241
It sure was, you did just right.


303
0:27:6,241 --> 0:27:9,904
Oh, my, look at this girl...
Well, guess I'll be edging along.


304
0:27:9,904 --> 0:27:11,465
So long everybody.
Bye.


305
0:27:11,465 --> 0:27:13,91
You look like an old lady.
Oh, mother, mommy!


306
0:27:13,91 --> 0:27:17,12
Oh, dear. You're so pretty.
Ain't she, Hitch?


307
0:27:17,12 --> 0:27:19,7
Yes.
Oh, this is Hitch Nelson.


308
0:27:19,7 --> 0:27:21,584
He's the Hitch I've been writing you about.


309
0:27:21,584 --> 0:27:23,566
How do you do, Mr. Nelson?
Make it Hitch, kid.


310
0:27:23,566 --> 0:27:26,783
We're all pals together.
What do you think of my great big girl.


311
0:27:26,783 --> 0:27:30,466
A litttle skinny.
Ah, Hitchy. Ain't he a lemon, though?


312
0:27:30,466 --> 0:27:32,696
Honest, the things he says to people I meet.


313
0:27:32,696 --> 0:27:34,802
He's a bad one.
He don't mean nothing by it.


314
0:27:34,802 --> 0:27:37,826
Now you sit down here.
Say, you better finish your change, beautiful.


315
0:27:37,826 --> 0:27:39,926
You only got a couple of minutes.
Yeah, that's right.


316
0:27:39,926 --> 0:27:42,59
If I had known
I could have company like this I... oooh!


317
0:27:42,59 --> 0:27:44,73
like this, well...


318
0:27:44,73 --> 0:27:48,78
Angel baby, just as soon as we get out of this joint
we'll go down to Gialetta's


319
0:27:48,78 --> 0:27:50,541
and we'll sit on the swellest place
you ever saw


320
0:27:50,541 --> 0:27:52,26
and stuff ourselves flat in the face.


321
0:27:52,26 --> 0:27:54,194
Up short, Kitty.
All right, all right.


322
0:27:54,194 --> 0:27:56,952
Come on, watch me finish the show.


323
0:27:56,952 --> 0:27:59,89
I'd rather stay here if you don't mind.


324
0:27:59,89 --> 0:28:7,42
All right for you then.


325
0:28:7,42 --> 0:28:9,333
Kick'er up, honey.


326
0:28:9,333 --> 0:28:11,675
Got any ideas about going into show business?


327
0:28:11,675 --> 0:28:13,418
No.
Why not?


328
0:28:13,418 --> 0:28:15,723
Don't you like it?
No.


329
0:28:15,723 --> 0:28:17,496
You're a funny kid.


330
0:28:17,496 --> 0:28:19,677
Oh, don't jump.
I ain't gonna bite.


331
0:28:19,677 --> 0:28:23,31
Did you hear that?
Suppose that was for you, huh?


332
0:28:23,31 --> 0:28:26,587
Everybody in the whole damn house
clapping and yelling.


333
0:28:26,587 --> 0:28:28,121
Going nuts about ya.


334
0:28:28,121 --> 0:28:29,908
Nice? No?


335
0:28:29,908 --> 0:28:31,23
Why not?


336
0:28:31,23 --> 0:28:33,439
You're a funny kid.


337
0:28:33,439 --> 0:28:34,862
Just a little bit goofy.


338
0:28:34,862 --> 0:28:37,273
But that's what comes
from not knowing what it's all about.


339
0:28:37,273 --> 0:28:38,527
Please, Mr. Nelson.


340
0:28:38,527 --> 0:28:40,127
Didn't I ask you to call me Hitch?


341
0:28:40,127 --> 0:28:41,999
I wanna be your pal, see?


342
0:28:41,999 --> 0:28:44,881
And if you listen to me you'll let me learn you
a couple of dance routines


343
0:28:44,881 --> 0:28:47,0
to put you in the show.
No, thank you.


344
0:28:47,0 --> 0:28:49,248
I'm pretty sure
I don't want to be in the show.


345
0:28:49,248 --> 0:28:51,281
But you've got the makings
of a great artist.


346
0:28:51,281 --> 0:28:52,782
With your looks and my training


347
0:28:52,782 --> 0:28:55,751
it's Broadway for you, no foolin'.
You take the word of an old cue man.


348
0:28:55,751 --> 0:29:37,692
That's the finale. Gotta go.
Seeya later, kid.


349
0:29:37,692 --> 0:29:44,227
...and give your baby nights a lovin'...


350
0:29:44,227 --> 0:29:51,122
Open up your eyes
and open up your lips


351
0:29:51,122 --> 0:29:53,74
Why don't you try to get some sleep, precious?


352
0:29:53,74 --> 0:29:59,252
I can't.


353
0:29:59,252 --> 0:30:3,1
You oughta be plenty tired
after your trip and all.


354
0:30:3,1 --> 0:30:4,919
Oh, I'm tired enough but...


355
0:30:4,919 --> 0:30:8,255
I don't know. I feel funny.


356
0:30:8,255 --> 0:30:11,36
All mixed up inside.


357
0:30:11,36 --> 0:30:15,503
Why, precious. What's the matter?
Tell mother what's the matter.


358
0:30:15,503 --> 0:30:19,564
Everything is so different
from what I thought it would be.


359
0:30:19,564 --> 0:30:22,196
Sure. You ain't in a convent anymore.


360
0:30:22,196 --> 0:30:24,58
But ain't you glad to be back with me again?


361
0:30:24,58 --> 0:30:26,382
Yes, mommy darling, but...


362
0:30:26,382 --> 0:30:30,36
I don't know how to describe it.


363
0:30:30,36 --> 0:30:31,761
But New York's too big,


364
0:30:31,761 --> 0:30:33,695
dirty and noisy.


365
0:30:33,695 --> 0:30:36,916
And your theater with all those men...


366
0:30:36,916 --> 0:30:40,97
and the girls with no clothes on.


367
0:30:40,97 --> 0:30:42,554
Oh, I suppose it does seem queer to you.


368
0:30:42,554 --> 0:30:45,655
Coming from a place
where they cover everything but their noses.


369
0:30:45,655 --> 0:30:47,679
But things ain't as bad as that.


370
0:30:47,679 --> 0:30:51,295
It ain't what you do so much.
It's what you are.


371
0:30:51,295 --> 0:30:53,3
That's it. It's what you are.


372
0:30:53,3 --> 0:30:55,857
Why there's a couple of dames in this troupe


373
0:30:55,857 --> 0:31:0,122
good at things you'd never expect to see,
even if they do make their living shaking.


374
0:31:0,122 --> 0:31:3,201
I ain't ashamed of it.
You shouldn't be ashamed of me neither.


375
0:31:3,201 --> 0:31:5,706
Oh, mommy, I'm not ashamed of you.


376
0:31:5,706 --> 0:31:8,772
Let me tell you something, April, baby.


377
0:31:8,772 --> 0:31:12,499
If it wasn't for the dough I've been piling up
that way in the last 10 or 12 years


378
0:31:12,499 --> 0:31:15,5
you would never have been to no convent.


379
0:31:15,5 --> 0:31:17,408
I know. I know.


380
0:31:17,408 --> 0:31:19,207
That's what I've been thinking.


381
0:31:19,207 --> 0:31:22,38
I'm just beginning to realize that.


382
0:31:22,38 --> 0:31:26,796
All these things you've gone through
and I never knew.


383
0:31:26,796 --> 0:31:32,355
Dancing with those girls.
Horrible men staring at you.


384
0:31:32,355 --> 0:31:33,993
Saying awful things.


385
0:31:33,993 --> 0:31:38,473
Now don't you think I'm going to be
in this burlesque racket all my life neither.


386
0:31:38,473 --> 0:31:43,313
Just one more season
with my name on Broadway in lights.


387
0:31:43,313 --> 0:31:47,25
And the big dough.
Then we'll have a nice little home.


388
0:31:47,25 --> 0:31:50,749
And we'll be together and be happy.


389
0:31:50,749 --> 0:31:52,83
Oh, mommy.


390
0:31:52,83 --> 0:31:56,956
You've done so much to make me happy.


391
0:31:56,956 --> 0:32:0,459
From now on I'll try and make you
just as happy.


392
0:32:0,459 --> 0:32:3,558
Oh, I ain't done nothing.


393
0:32:3,558 --> 0:32:6,879
But we've got each other from now on
and it's gonna be for always.


394
0:32:6,879 --> 0:32:10,98
Yes, for always.


395
0:32:10,98 --> 0:32:12,272
And we'll be so happy together.


396
0:32:12,272 --> 0:32:14,443
Just you and I.


397
0:32:14,443 --> 0:32:16,249
You said it.


398
0:32:16,249 --> 0:32:20,915
After all, snooks, things can't be all bad
as long as we got each other.


399
0:32:20,915 --> 0:32:22,814
Don't you forget that.


400
0:32:22,814 --> 0:32:26,275
Now you go to sleep, now.


401
0:32:26,275 --> 0:32:32,165
Close your pretty eyes
and close your pretty lips


402
0:32:32,165 --> 0:32:38,37
and give your baby nights a loving...


403
0:32:38,37 --> 0:32:41,57
Mommy, about Mr. Nelson


404
0:32:41,57 --> 0:32:44,149
What about him?


405
0:32:44,149 --> 0:32:46,139
I don't think he likes me.


406
0:32:46,139 --> 0:32:51,973
Aw, he's crazy about you.
Why, he said so.


407
0:32:51,973 --> 0:32:53,404
Are you going to be married?


408
0:32:53,404 --> 0:32:56,302
Really?
I don't know?


409
0:32:56,302 --> 0:32:58,39
I don't know.


410
0:32:58,39 --> 0:33:0,28
But don't you worry about it, now.


411
0:33:0,28 --> 0:33:3,122
Go to sleep, baby.
Go to sleep.


412
0:33:3,122 --> 0:33:9,687
Close your pretty eyes
and close your pretty lips


413
0:33:9,687 --> 0:33:11,596
Oh, Holy Virgin...


414
0:33:11,596 --> 0:33:16,689
by the pain...
in which our Lord Jesus Christ...


415
0:33:16,689 --> 0:33:19,817
Bore the burden of our sins...


416
0:33:19,817 --> 0:33:23,382
obtain for us


417
0:33:23,382 --> 0:33:25,604
by thy intecession


418
0:33:25,604 --> 0:33:27,325
the courage and strength


419
0:33:27,325 --> 0:33:29,778
Follow in his footsteps


420
0:33:29,778 --> 0:33:32,644
and bear our cross


421
0:33:32,644 --> 0:33:36,443
until the end of our lives.


422
0:33:36,443 --> 0:34:3,728
Amen.


423
0:34:3,728 --> 0:34:9,4
What do you want?


424
0:34:9,4 --> 0:34:10,481
You'll wake her up.


425
0:34:10,481 --> 0:35:29,499
Get us a drink.


426
0:35:29,499 --> 0:35:32,189
Oh, mommy. Mommy, the telephone.


427
0:35:32,189 --> 0:35:36,613
All right, baby.


428
0:35:36,613 --> 0:35:39,141
Did you have a good sleep, angel?
Yes, thank you.


429
0:35:39,141 --> 0:35:42,571
Hello. Oh, hello, Gus.
Good morning yourself.


430
0:35:42,571 --> 0:35:47,677
Oh, is that all? Ok, we'll meet the troupe
at the station at three.


431
0:35:47,677 --> 0:35:51,951
That was Gus Weinbaum from the booking office.
We open in Buffalo this week.


432
0:35:51,951 --> 0:35:55,36
Better get up and get dressed, precious.
We gotta start packing.


433
0:35:55,36 --> 0:35:58,855
Got a nice cold grapefruit
for you and a swell breakfast.


434
0:35:58,855 --> 0:36:0,297
Oh, good.


435
0:36:0,297 --> 0:36:3,735
We open in Buffalo tomorrow.


436
0:36:3,735 --> 0:36:5,957
Now Hitch, honey...


437
0:36:5,957 --> 0:36:7,893
Let's settle our problems.


438
0:36:7,893 --> 0:36:11,691
You and me, we can't go on like we have
with April here.


439
0:36:11,691 --> 0:36:13,682
We gotta get married now.


440
0:36:13,682 --> 0:36:15,644
Well, it's up to you, Kitty.


441
0:36:15,644 --> 0:36:18,92
It's okay with me like I told ya,


442
0:36:18,92 --> 0:36:20,52
providing that kid of yours is put to work.


443
0:36:20,52 --> 0:36:23,186
She will, honey, she is going to work,
but not in show business.


444
0:36:23,186 --> 0:36:26,31
I got other plans for her.
There you go again.


445
0:36:26,31 --> 0:36:27,9
What else can she do, I'm asking ya?


446
0:36:27,9 --> 0:36:31,289
I mean, here we are,
jumping to Buffalo with that...


447
0:36:31,289 --> 0:36:32,821
and from there, well, who knows?


448
0:36:32,821 --> 0:36:35,62
Now if she gets a job in New York
that means she can't travel with us.


449
0:36:35,62 --> 0:36:37,995
So, are you planning on leaving her alone here?


450
0:36:37,995 --> 0:36:40,759
The kid's got a real chance in burlesque.
Don't you see that?


451
0:36:40,759 --> 0:36:45,61
She's got youth, looks, the whole works.
She comes by it naturally.


452
0:36:45,61 --> 0:36:47,499
I can make her one of the biggest bets
in show business.


453
0:36:47,499 --> 0:36:50,359
But she don't wanna be in show business.
She said she hates it.


454
0:36:50,359 --> 0:36:52,532
How does a kid like that
know what she wants?


455
0:36:52,532 --> 0:36:55,558
Now listen, Kitty. I'm not gonna waste
any more time arguing.


456
0:36:55,558 --> 0:36:57,899
I'm not gonna get married unless
I'm gonna be the boss.


457
0:36:57,899 --> 0:37:1,194
And if I'm gonna be the boss,
I say the kid is going into show.


458
0:37:1,194 --> 0:37:4,353
That's final.
I don't know. Don't be cross at me, Hitch.


459
0:37:4,353 --> 0:37:8,548
I'm trying to do the best all around.
If you think it's the right thing to do...


460
0:37:8,548 --> 0:37:10,813
Why, sure it is, babes.


461
0:37:10,813 --> 0:37:14,403
You go on in there and get her.
I'll talk to her.


462
0:37:14,403 --> 0:37:18,822
I'll sell her the idea. She's getting
the swellest break a kid ever got.


463
0:37:18,822 --> 0:37:21,85
We'll be one big happy family, huh?


464
0:37:21,85 --> 0:37:23,395
The three of us.


465
0:37:23,395 --> 0:37:26,148
We'll go to Buffalo
or any other man's place, huh?


466
0:37:26,148 --> 0:37:28,275
Come on, get her in here.
April!


467
0:37:28,275 --> 0:37:32,405
April, baby. Come here.
Mommy wants to talk to you.


468
0:37:32,405 --> 0:37:34,961
Come here, baby.
Come to your daddy.


469
0:37:34,961 --> 0:37:50,79
He's gonna pour a million dollars
in gold in your lap.


470
0:37:50,79 --> 0:38:50,775
Here's to the bride and groom.


471
0:38:50,775 --> 0:38:52,573
How's that?
Rotten.


472
0:38:52,573 --> 0:38:54,997
Now look, now.


473
0:38:54,997 --> 0:38:56,999
Don't!
What's the matter?


474
0:38:56,999 --> 0:38:59,758
I don't like to be mauled
Too bad about you.


475
0:38:59,758 --> 0:39:2,325
Maybe a good maul would do you good
for a change.


476
0:39:2,325 --> 0:39:6,797
This touch-me-not stuff is beginning to give
me a pain in the neck.


477
0:39:6,797 --> 0:39:8,169
What's the idea of that?


478
0:39:8,169 --> 0:39:11,57
It's too hot in here.
Yeah?


479
0:39:11,57 --> 0:39:17,306
Come on,
let's run through that tap routine.


480
0:39:17,306 --> 0:39:17,39
All right.


481
0:39:17,39 --> 0:39:18,903
What's the matter with you?


482
0:39:18,903 --> 0:39:20,466
You've been in the show eight months


483
0:39:20,466 --> 0:39:22,961
and you got about as much ambition
as a Ziegfeld clothes horse.


484
0:39:22,961 --> 0:39:25,328
Can't you take a little interest
in what I'm trying to teach you?


485
0:39:25,328 --> 0:39:28,227
No. I hate dance.
And I hate burlesque.


486
0:39:28,227 --> 0:39:30,579
You don't have to stay in burlesque.


487
0:39:30,579 --> 0:39:34,998
Just give me a little cooperation
I'll make another Marilyn Miller out of you.


488
0:39:34,998 --> 0:39:36,379
I'm not interested.


489
0:39:36,379 --> 0:39:38,945
Will you lay off that tone of voice?


490
0:39:38,945 --> 0:39:41,327
Here I am. Trying to help you,
trying to be your pal.


491
0:39:41,327 --> 0:39:44,271
You treat me like I was an ashman
or something.


492
0:39:44,271 --> 0:39:46,332
Jeez, you get my goat!


493
0:39:46,332 --> 0:39:48,9
Why don't to let me alone.


494
0:39:48,9 --> 0:39:49,18
Let you alone?


495
0:39:49,18 --> 0:39:52,817
Listen, what you need is to have somebody
wake you up and make you be human.


496
0:39:52,817 --> 0:39:56,281
I got a good mind to teach you a couple of tricks
they'd never learn you in a convent.


497
0:39:56,281 --> 0:39:58,776
You won't teach me anything.
Let go of my wrist.


498
0:39:58,776 --> 0:40:1,321
I met babies like you before, Saint Cecilia.


499
0:40:1,321 --> 0:40:5,505
There's only one way to treat them
and that's rough.


500
0:40:5,505 --> 0:40:7,241
There, that's something to think about.


501
0:40:7,241 --> 0:40:9,692
Oh, oh!


502
0:40:9,692 --> 0:40:13,12
What's going on here?
It's just that precious infant of yours
getting temperamental again.


503
0:40:13,12 --> 0:40:14,629
Don't you two ever stop fighting?


504
0:40:14,629 --> 0:40:17,297
here I am, working like a dog
trying to learn her the business.


505
0:40:17,297 --> 0:40:18,538
Never mind.


506
0:40:18,538 --> 0:40:21,818
What do you think that dirty little
Gus Weinbaum pulled on me this morning?


507
0:40:21,818 --> 0:40:24,597
He said he ain't gonna give me a contract
for the new stock season...


508
0:40:24,597 --> 0:40:27,576
till I've been in the show for two weeks
and he can see how I get by.


509
0:40:27,576 --> 0:40:31,745
Not only that, he practically insists that I
go with a bunch of the girls...


510
0:40:31,745 --> 0:40:35,178
to a lousy stag smoker in the Bronx after the show tonight.


511
0:40:35,178 --> 0:40:36,641
Can you beat that for a nerve?


512
0:40:36,641 --> 0:40:40,502
Me, Kitty Darling,
dancing for a lot of drunk stags.


513
0:40:40,502 --> 0:40:42,434
Well, what of it? The problem with you
and that kid of yours


514
0:40:42,434 --> 0:40:44,61
is you're both getting too high-hat.


515
0:40:44,61 --> 0:40:48,773
Why, Hitchy.


516
0:40:48,773 --> 0:40:52,6
What's the matter with you, cookie?
Oh, nothing.


517
0:40:52,6 --> 0:40:53,961
You hadn't oughta be fighting all the time.


518
0:40:53,961 --> 0:40:56,513
I'd like you'd to try to be nice
to him for a change.


519
0:40:56,513 --> 0:40:58,13
Try to make him love you, cookie.


520
0:40:58,13 --> 0:41:1,39
Make him love me?
Yes, angel. Make him love you.


521
0:41:1,39 --> 0:41:9,693
For my sake.


522
0:41:9,693 --> 0:41:12,517
This is a swell night
to be going to a stag smoker.


523
0:41:12,517 --> 0:41:14,396
Thought you were going to try
to get me out of it.


524
0:41:14,396 --> 0:41:17,33
Well, I argued with Gus
but it didn't do no good.


525
0:41:17,33 --> 0:41:21,463
A good husband you are, letting Gus send your wife
to shake for a mob Bronx gorillas.


526
0:41:21,463 --> 0:41:25,494
On such a hot night.
Well, fifty bucks is fifty bucks.


527
0:41:25,494 --> 0:41:27,345
Ready to go home, mommy?


528
0:41:27,345 --> 0:41:29,489
No, sweetness,
I gotta go to that stag smoker.


529
0:41:29,489 --> 0:41:31,104
Hitch couldn't fix it for me with Gus.


530
0:41:31,104 --> 0:41:33,144
I'll see that you get home okay, April.


531
0:41:33,144 --> 0:41:34,402
I gotta get going.


532
0:41:34,402 --> 0:41:36,729
Come on, snooks,
walk out to the door with me.


533
0:41:36,729 --> 0:41:38,497
You wait outside for me, April.


534
0:41:38,497 --> 0:41:40,595
She will.
Mommy, take me with you, please.


535
0:41:40,595 --> 0:41:43,655
To a stag party? I should say not.
I'll wait outside for you.


536
0:41:43,655 --> 0:41:45,413
Till 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning?


537
0:41:45,413 --> 0:41:47,573
You're crazy.
Now you go back to the hotel.


538
0:41:47,573 --> 0:41:49,598
I don't want to go back to the hotel
with Hitch.


539
0:41:49,598 --> 0:41:53,101
Please, mommy, please.
The girls in the taxi are waiting for you, Miss Darling.


540
0:41:53,101 --> 0:41:55,663
Thanks, Otto.
Now you stop fussing about Hitch.


541
0:41:55,663 --> 0:41:58,13
Be a good girl.
Maybe he'll buy you some chop suey.


542
0:41:58,13 --> 0:42:19,776
I gotta tip him.
Mommy!


543
0:42:19,776 --> 0:42:22,729
Oh, hey, I've been waiting for you.


544
0:42:22,729 --> 0:42:25,518
Oops! Hello, kid.
Hey give us a kiss.


545
0:42:25,518 --> 0:42:26,917
What's your hurry, sister?


546
0:42:26,917 --> 0:42:28,975
Where are you going, baby?


547
0:42:28,975 --> 0:42:33,17
Wait a minute, sweetheart.
Come on, baby, give me a break.


548
0:42:33,17 --> 0:42:34,761
Say, listen now, just...


549
0:42:34,761 --> 0:42:38,11
Say, who do you think you're messing with?
Stay away!


550
0:42:38,11 --> 0:42:40,905
Hey, what's this?
Keep out of this. She's my girl.


551
0:42:40,905 --> 0:42:42,585
I am not. He's following me.


552
0:42:42,585 --> 0:42:45,337
On your way, guy, or I'll poke a hole
through that pant of yours.


553
0:42:45,337 --> 0:42:49,574
You and Harmony Marines.


554
0:42:49,574 --> 0:42:52,274
You Navy guys think you're tough, don't ya?


555
0:42:52,274 --> 0:42:56,35
They don't come any tougher.


556
0:42:56,35 --> 0:43:0,188
Got any other odd jobs for the Navy tonight?
No, thank you so much.


557
0:43:0,188 --> 0:43:3,426
Pretty late for a little girl like you
to be wandering around by yourself.


558
0:43:3,426 --> 0:43:5,346
Maybe I'll have to stroll a little way with you.


559
0:43:5,346 --> 0:43:6,63
Oh, please don't bother.


560
0:43:6,63 --> 0:43:16,71
Did you say "bother"?


561
0:43:16,71 --> 0:43:19,18
Hope you don't think I'm fresh
walking along with you like this.


562
0:43:19,18 --> 0:43:20,868
Not at all.


563
0:43:20,868 --> 0:43:23,399
I hope you don't think
I'm trying to follow you or anything.


564
0:43:23,399 --> 0:43:24,838
Oh, no.


565
0:43:24,838 --> 0:43:26,674
Live around here?
No.


566
0:43:26,674 --> 0:43:32,7
I come all the way from Wisconsin.
Why don't you go back?


567
0:43:32,7 --> 0:43:34,393
Say, I think you're trying to get rid of me.


568
0:43:34,393 --> 0:43:37,557
How did you guess?
Oh, I'm clever that way.


569
0:43:37,557 --> 0:43:40,381
What way?
Oh, come on, be nice, won't you?


570
0:43:40,381 --> 0:43:42,499
I'm not a gorilla.
But I don't know you.


571
0:43:42,499 --> 0:43:45,688
Well, use your chance.
No, listen, here's the idea.


572
0:43:45,688 --> 0:43:48,704
Why not let's stop somewhere and get something to eat?
There's no harm in that.


573
0:43:48,704 --> 0:43:51,368
And if you don't like the cut of my gib
I'll be on my way.


574
0:43:51,368 --> 0:43:53,899
Well, that seems fair enough.


575
0:43:53,899 --> 0:43:56,464
I always eat after the show anyway.


576
0:43:56,464 --> 0:43:58,487
Now you're talking.


577
0:43:58,487 --> 0:44:0,791
Say, you're nice.
You don't look like a show girl.


578
0:44:0,791 --> 0:44:2,452
Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned it.


579
0:44:2,452 --> 0:44:4,617
No kidding, I like you.


580
0:44:4,617 --> 0:44:7,282
And I guess you're not so bad yourself.


581
0:44:7,282 --> 0:44:14,702
Come on, Wisconsin.


582
0:44:14,702 --> 0:44:17,566
Boy, was I hungry.
Me too.


583
0:44:17,566 --> 0:44:20,228
Gee, you don't know
how much I appreciate this.


584
0:44:20,228 --> 0:44:23,221
No kidding. I mean,
I've been cruising around town all evening...


585
0:44:23,221 --> 0:44:25,265
up one street and down the other.


586
0:44:25,265 --> 0:44:27,81
Just looking for somebody to talk to.


587
0:44:27,81 --> 0:44:30,17
Sailors don't generally have much trouble
finding company.


588
0:44:30,17 --> 0:44:32,195
Oh, I don't want the kind of company you mean.


589
0:44:32,195 --> 0:44:34,652
Listen, all sailors ain't a bunch of bums.


590
0:44:34,652 --> 0:44:39,149
But you got no idea how tough it is
to be all alone and lonesome in a city like this.


591
0:44:39,149 --> 0:44:40,668
Maybe I have.


592
0:44:40,668 --> 0:44:42,619
Aw, a girl like you lonesome.


593
0:44:42,619 --> 0:44:44,535
So, what's your name, anyway?


594
0:44:44,535 --> 0:44:47,263
I've been so excited about finding you
I forgot to ask.


595
0:44:47,263 --> 0:44:49,466
April.
April?


596
0:44:49,466 --> 0:44:51,107
No kidding?


597
0:44:51,107 --> 0:44:52,992
Sounds like a name out of a book.


598
0:44:52,992 --> 0:44:55,406
I don't know, though.
It sorta fits you.


599
0:44:55,406 --> 0:44:59,1
Sounds sweet, sort of gentle.
Just like I bet you are.


600
0:44:59,1 --> 0:45:1,695
Oh, you say the same thing
to every girl you meet.


601
0:45:1,695 --> 0:45:5,823
How could I?
I never met a girl named April before.


602
0:45:5,823 --> 0:45:7,86
What's your name?
Tony.


603
0:45:7,86 --> 0:45:10,687
I don't like it much.
Sounds like a white bootblack.


604
0:45:10,687 --> 0:45:12,767
Oh, no, I think Tony's a nice name.


605
0:45:12,767 --> 0:45:15,36
You do?
Tony and April.


606
0:45:15,36 --> 0:45:17,338
Sounds nice together, eh?


607
0:45:17,338 --> 0:45:21,985
Gee, but your eyes are blue.


608
0:45:21,985 --> 0:45:27,377
Eat your chocolate cake.


609
0:45:27,377 --> 0:45:31,285
April.


610
0:45:31,285 --> 0:45:32,577
April.


611
0:45:32,577 --> 0:45:33,784
April.


612
0:45:33,784 --> 0:45:37,2
Why the little...


613
0:45:37,2 --> 0:45:39,399
Hello, Ed?
Did April come in yet?


614
0:45:39,399 --> 0:45:40,54
She didn't?


615
0:45:40,54 --> 0:45:41,813
Are you sure?


616
0:45:41,813 --> 0:45:43,115
Thanks.


617
0:45:43,115 --> 0:46:6,142
The little...


618
0:46:6,142 --> 0:46:8,43
Those big waves...


619
0:46:8,43 --> 0:46:12,499
Gosh, they look to be about as tall
as the Woolworth building, pretty near.


620
0:46:12,499 --> 0:46:14,829
They'd come down over the bough, crash.


621
0:46:14,829 --> 0:46:17,487
And the ship would shake
like it was gonna split in two.


622
0:46:17,487 --> 0:46:19,675
One big wave after the other.


623
0:46:19,675 --> 0:46:22,787
Boy, all night we didn't know
if we was gonna weather it or not.


624
0:46:22,787 --> 0:46:24,925
Well, anyway...


625
0:46:24,925 --> 0:46:26,575
next morning the sun was shining


626
0:46:26,575 --> 0:46:28,837
the ocean was as smooth as glass.


627
0:46:28,837 --> 0:46:31,469
And right up the starboard
was the coast of China.


628
0:46:31,469 --> 0:46:34,847
It must be wonderful
to sail all over the world that way.


629
0:46:34,847 --> 0:46:37,965
Oh, I don't know. You get tired of it
just like anything else.


630
0:46:37,965 --> 0:46:41,206
I got a week to make up my mind
if I'm gonna enlist again.


631
0:46:41,206 --> 0:46:42,489
I suppose I will.


632
0:46:42,489 --> 0:46:45,425
Sorry, pal. Closing time.


633
0:46:45,425 --> 0:46:47,101
But the park is still open.


634
0:46:47,101 --> 0:46:48,841
Okay, skipper.


635
0:46:48,841 --> 0:46:56,5
I had no idea it was so late.


636
0:46:56,5 --> 0:46:59,383
Here you are.


637
0:46:59,383 --> 0:47:1,454
Gee, I don't want to lose you so soon.


638
0:47:1,454 --> 0:47:3,4
Just when we were getting acquainted.


639
0:47:3,4 --> 0:47:4,859
Can't we find some other place?


640
0:47:4,859 --> 0:47:8,569
But it's pretty late.
I know just the place. It's nice and cool too.


641
0:47:8,569 --> 0:47:9,665
Where?


642
0:47:9,665 --> 0:47:39,96
Brooklyn Bridge.


643
0:47:39,96 --> 0:47:42,633
Isn't it beautiful?


644
0:47:42,633 --> 0:47:47,176
Yeah. Sure is pretty.


645
0:47:47,176 --> 0:47:53,8
Even Brooklyn looks pretty.


646
0:47:53,8 --> 0:47:54,481
It must be awfully late.


647
0:47:54,481 --> 0:47:57,205
What do you care?
My mother will be worried.


648
0:47:57,205 --> 0:48:0,74
I do have to sleep some time.


649
0:48:0,74 --> 0:48:4,169
They have rehearsal at eleven.


650
0:48:4,169 --> 0:48:9,97
Well, I won't get much sleep tonight.


651
0:48:9,97 --> 0:48:10,62
It's too hot to sleep.


652
0:48:10,62 --> 0:48:17,777
I mean, I'll be thinking about you.


653
0:48:17,777 --> 0:48:20,753
Look at that city over there.


654
0:48:20,753 --> 0:48:22,649
Everybody sleeping.


655
0:48:22,649 --> 0:48:26,534
Everybody dreaming.


656
0:48:26,534 --> 0:48:28,992
And two people like us, on this bridge


657
0:48:28,992 --> 0:48:32,916
just as if we've known each other
all our lives.


658
0:48:32,916 --> 0:48:35,6
It's sort of like a dream too,
isn't it?


659
0:48:35,6 --> 0:48:39,707
Yeah.


660
0:48:39,707 --> 0:48:42,37
Pretty soon the sun will come up


661
0:48:42,37 --> 0:48:43,841
and the people will wake up.


662
0:48:43,841 --> 0:48:48,4
and even you and I will go right on
the way we were before.


663
0:48:48,4 --> 0:48:50,796
Just as if we'd never met at all.


664
0:48:50,796 --> 0:48:52,636
Say, don't kid yourself.


665
0:48:52,636 --> 0:48:56,579
I'm gonna camp right on your doorstep
the rest of the time I'm on leave.


666
0:48:56,579 --> 0:48:57,778
How long is that?


667
0:48:57,778 --> 0:49:1,565
Saturday. This is Tuesday.
That makes four days.


668
0:49:1,565 --> 0:49:4,377
And then you'll forget all about me.


669
0:49:4,377 --> 0:49:6,209
No, sir. Never.


670
0:49:6,209 --> 0:49:7,657
Yes, you will.


671
0:49:7,657 --> 0:49:10,393
You'll go sailing away from me,


672
0:49:10,393 --> 0:49:14,55
just like that boat down there will now.


673
0:49:14,55 --> 0:49:17,393
A tanker going out with the tide.


674
0:49:17,393 --> 0:49:20,653
Ships have to go out with the tide,
don't they?


675
0:49:20,653 --> 0:49:23,31
And sailors have to go with their ships.


676
0:49:23,31 --> 0:49:26,463
And the world is full of other
rivers and bridges


677
0:49:26,463 --> 0:49:31,83
with girls to sit on them
till the tide goes out.


678
0:49:31,83 --> 0:49:36,858
Oh, April, I'm not like the rest of those gobs.


679
0:49:36,858 --> 0:49:40,385
Sometimes I think there are people
who were just meant to be lonesome.


680
0:49:40,385 --> 0:49:41,779
You know,


681
0:49:41,779 --> 0:49:45,523
and then they'll meet someone
for a little while


682
0:49:45,523 --> 0:49:49,127
and it gives them something to remember.


683
0:49:49,127 --> 0:49:53,451
So their lonesomeness doesn't hurt
so much for a while.


684
0:49:53,451 --> 0:49:56,0
I don't know how to say what I mean.


685
0:49:56,0 --> 0:49:58,86
Yes, but if those people meet
the right people


686
0:49:58,86 --> 0:50:1,9
they get together for keeps.


687
0:50:1,9 --> 0:50:3,19
Then they ain't lonesome anymore.


688
0:50:3,19 --> 0:50:9,194
But the right people
don't seem to find each other very often.


689
0:50:9,194 --> 0:50:18,835
Yeah, ain't it the truth.


690
0:50:18,835 --> 0:50:23,758
Well, Tony...


691
0:50:23,758 --> 0:50:26,613
Well...
I've got to go home.


692
0:50:26,613 --> 0:50:30,395
I don't want to, but I've got to.


693
0:50:30,395 --> 0:50:49,5
Right. Let me help you down.


694
0:50:49,5 --> 0:50:50,145
Good night.


695
0:50:50,145 --> 0:50:52,179
Or rather, good morning.


696
0:50:52,179 --> 0:50:54,755
Don't forget tomorrow. It's a date.


697
0:50:54,755 --> 0:50:56,356
I won't.


698
0:50:56,356 --> 0:50:58,497
I hope I'm gonna live that long.


699
0:50:58,497 --> 0:51:3,173
Just don't stop breathing.


700
0:51:3,173 --> 0:51:5,239
Looks like I just can't let you go.


701
0:51:5,239 --> 0:51:9,897
I've really got to go now.


702
0:51:9,897 --> 0:51:12,195
Well...


703
0:51:12,195 --> 0:51:16,8
Well...


704
0:51:16,8 --> 0:51:17,524
Good night.


705
0:51:17,524 --> 0:51:32,671
Good night.


706
0:51:32,671 --> 0:51:37,134
Good night, girls. Go right home, now.
Leave that taxi driver alone.


707
0:51:37,134 --> 0:51:39,625
Hello, sailor boy.
Hello, yourself.


708
0:51:39,625 --> 0:51:52,99
What's the rush, sailor boy?


709
0:51:52,99 --> 0:51:54,575
Well, young lady,
where do you think you've been?


710
0:51:54,575 --> 0:51:57,947
Is mommy in yet?
Never mind. Who've you been out with
until 5 o'clock in the morning?


711
0:51:57,947 --> 0:51:59,131
None of your business.


712
0:51:59,131 --> 0:52:2,914
A pickup, huh? A pickup just like every other
cheap little burlesque dame.


713
0:52:2,914 --> 0:52:5,289
I'm not a cheap little burlesque dame.
No?


714
0:52:5,289 --> 0:52:7,506
Just an innocent kid from a convent, huh?


715
0:52:7,506 --> 0:52:8,891
Well get this through your head.


716
0:52:8,891 --> 0:52:12,548
If you're gonna start this stay-out-all-night stuff
I'm gonna have something to say about it myself.


717
0:52:12,548 --> 0:52:15,39
Charity begins at home, baby.
Let me go!


718
0:52:15,39 --> 0:52:16,655
Let me go...


719
0:52:16,655 --> 0:52:20,223
Well, what's this?


720
0:52:20,223 --> 0:52:24,285
Hello, beautiful. You're just in time to witness
the signing of the Peace Treaty.


721
0:52:24,285 --> 0:52:26,547
While we was waiting for you
we come to an understanding.


722
0:52:26,547 --> 0:52:30,444
Everything's jake now.
April April, is it true?


723
0:52:30,444 --> 0:52:32,806
Just one big happy family from now on.


724
0:52:32,806 --> 0:52:34,99
Everything's swell okay.


725
0:52:34,99 --> 0:52:42,91
One big happy family, hooray!


726
0:52:42,91 --> 0:53:8,51
Oooh, gee wiz, I gotta lie down,


727
0:53:8,51 --> 0:53:12,744
Gee.
Look at all those people down there.


728
0:53:12,744 --> 0:53:14,86
Aren't there a lot of people
in the word, though?


729
0:53:14,86 --> 0:53:21,664
Only two as far as I'm concerned.


730
0:53:21,664 --> 0:53:25,503
Look.


731
0:53:25,503 --> 0:53:27,188
Just look.


732
0:53:27,188 --> 0:53:33,8
I'd hate to fall.
If you did, I'd fall right after you.


733
0:53:33,8 --> 0:53:51,4
Wouldn't that be silly?


734
0:53:51,4 --> 0:53:58,272
Look, the Woolworth Building.
Yeah.


735
0:53:58,272 --> 0:54:0,47
That's some sight, isn't it?


736
0:54:0,47 --> 0:54:1,63
Oh, it's wonderful.


737
0:54:1,63 --> 0:54:9,69
You are wonderful.


738
0:54:9,69 --> 0:54:12,339
Well, there's the sea.
Yes.


739
0:54:12,339 --> 0:54:14,977
Look at the old Statue of Liberty.


740
0:54:14,977 --> 0:54:18,977
I bet if I stood here I could see your ship
when it leaves tonight.


741
0:54:18,977 --> 0:54:25,225
I should wave my handkerchief.


742
0:54:25,225 --> 0:54:28,8
What are you laughing at?


743
0:54:28,8 --> 0:54:30,752
Well, April, I'm not going back to my ship.


744
0:54:30,752 --> 0:54:31,952
Why not?


745
0:54:31,952 --> 0:54:34,801
Well, I got an important date tomorrow.


746
0:54:34,801 --> 0:54:36,463
Have you?
Hm-hm.


747
0:54:36,463 --> 0:54:39,461
And so have you.
We're gonna be married.


748
0:54:39,461 --> 0:54:42,73
Oh, I thought for a minute you were serious.


749
0:54:42,73 --> 0:54:43,989
I am.


750
0:54:43,989 --> 0:54:45,428
You're gonna marry me...


751
0:54:45,428 --> 0:54:47,862
and we're going back to my home town in Wisconsin


752
0:54:47,862 --> 0:54:52,46
and graze wheat and have a Ford,
a radio, well, and several things.


753
0:54:52,46 --> 0:54:53,641
We are not.


754
0:54:53,641 --> 0:54:55,42
Oh, yes we are.


755
0:54:55,42 --> 0:54:57,5
You're gonna marry me.
It's all decided.


756
0:54:57,5 --> 0:54:59,178
I decided it.
Did you?


757
0:54:59,178 --> 0:55:1,601
You better say yes.
I don't see why.


758
0:55:1,601 --> 0:55:5,362
Because if you don't,
I'll jump right off this roof.


759
0:55:5,362 --> 0:55:30,524
Oh, Tony!
Yes!


760
0:55:30,524 --> 0:55:32,251
Aw, gee, I'm happy.


761
0:55:32,251 --> 0:55:39,95
Aren't you?
Yes.


762
0:55:39,95 --> 0:55:43,51
What I know about sailors, they 


763
0:55:43,51 --> 0:55:47,78
But I believe everything
you told me about yourself and your folks.


764
0:55:47,78 --> 0:55:50,523
I think you're on the level.
You bet I'm on the level, Miss Darling.


765
0:55:50,523 --> 0:55:52,617
You gotta be good to my little girl.


766
0:55:52,617 --> 0:55:55,752
She's just a baby.
Don't worry about that.


767
0:55:55,752 --> 0:55:57,506
She'll love it out in the country.


768
0:55:57,506 --> 0:55:59,671
My folks will be crazy about her.


769
0:55:59,671 --> 0:56:2,367
Well, that's that, I suppose.


770
0:56:2,367 --> 0:56:6,95
I'm glad. I never wanted April to be in show business.


771
0:56:6,95 --> 0:56:8,57
My baby angel.


772
0:56:8,57 --> 0:56:10,953
What's the next thing on the program?


773
0:56:10,953 --> 0:56:14,206
Why, I thought we all might all have dinner
some place to celebrate.


774
0:56:14,206 --> 0:56:16,704
Where? You gotta make it early.
I have a show.


775
0:56:16,704 --> 0:56:19,134
How about that chop suey place
we was at the other night?


776
0:56:19,134 --> 0:56:20,798
That's fine.
Okay, about six?


777
0:56:20,798 --> 0:56:23,487
Great. Well, I'll be running along.


778
0:56:23,487 --> 0:56:31,151
Goodbye for a little while, sweetheart.


779
0:56:31,151 --> 0:56:36,883
Oh, excuse me.


780
0:56:36,883 --> 0:56:48,271
You're all right, son.


781
0:56:48,271 --> 0:56:52,3
Was that the boyfreind we've been hearing so much about
I've just run across in the hall?


782
0:56:52,3 --> 0:56:53,745
Mommy, I'll go in and change my dress.


783
0:56:53,745 --> 0:56:55,73
Wait a minute, I'm talking to you.


784
0:56:55,73 --> 0:56:57,288
This playing around with the Navy's gotta stop.


785
0:56:57,288 --> 0:57:0,209
Oh, let her alone.
She's got a date with her fiancée.


786
0:57:0,209 --> 0:57:1,322
Her what?


787
0:57:1,322 --> 0:57:2,737
The man she's gonna marry.


788
0:57:2,737 --> 0:57:4,58
Are you trying to kid me?


789
0:57:4,58 --> 0:57:6,182
No, April's gonna be married.


790
0:57:6,182 --> 0:57:9,602
You're telling me you're gonna allow April
to marry some lousy gob?


791
0:57:9,602 --> 0:57:12,501
Oh, he's all right. I like him.
We had a long talk.


792
0:57:12,501 --> 0:57:14,166
You had a long talk.


793
0:57:14,166 --> 0:57:16,96
Well, how about consulting me once in a while?


794
0:57:16,96 --> 0:57:18,937
Oh, turn your dapper down.
Everything's under control.


795
0:57:18,937 --> 0:57:21,14
Oh, it is, is it?
That's what you say.


796
0:57:21,14 --> 0:57:24,39
Now me just back from a two-hour session
at the Keith Office getting our acts set.


797
0:57:24,39 --> 0:57:25,991
What's that got to do with April?


798
0:57:25,991 --> 0:57:27,78
Everything.
They want her to do it with me.


799
0:57:27,78 --> 0:57:29,462
But that's our act.
Yours and mine.


800
0:57:29,462 --> 0:57:32,597
Well, it's all been changed.
It's April or the whole proposition's cold.


801
0:57:32,597 --> 0:57:35,7
They want a younger woman in the act,
that's all, luscious.


802
0:57:35,7 --> 0:57:38,248
A younger woman?
Yeah, they want it younger, like April.


803
0:57:38,248 --> 0:57:41,845
She's ideal.
A smile like hers is worth a million dollars.


804
0:57:41,845 --> 0:57:44,225
She's got a swell figure
and a pair of legs that...


805
0:57:44,225 --> 0:57:45,931
Why, she's got more sex-appeal than...


806
0:57:45,931 --> 0:57:48,202
For a dame you couldn't stand the sight of
a few days ago...


807
0:57:48,202 --> 0:57:51,291
you seem to be taking a big interest in April
and her sex-appeal.


808
0:57:51,291 --> 0:57:53,354
Professionally, sure.
Yeah?


809
0:57:53,354 --> 0:57:55,939
I wanna see her get ahead.
I got our future in mind.


810
0:57:55,939 --> 0:57:57,69
What about my future?


811
0:57:57,69 --> 0:57:58,91
Now, beautiful.
Beautiful my eye. Listen, Hitch Nelson.


812
0:57:58,91 --> 0:58:1,426
Nobody's gonna do that act but me, see?


813
0:58:1,426 --> 0:58:3,822
I don't know what you and the Keith Office
got up your sleeve


814
0:58:3,822 --> 0:58:5,766
but nobody's double-crossing Kitty Darling.


815
0:58:5,766 --> 0:58:6,886
Oh, yeah?


816
0:58:6,886 --> 0:58:9,918
Well, I'll show you how much
I'm double-crossing ya, wise girl.


817
0:58:9,918 --> 0:58:12,344
You don't have to know I spent the whole morning
with Gus Weinbaum


818
0:58:12,344 --> 0:58:15,18
begging him to keep you in your own show.
What are you trying to give me now?


819
0:58:15,18 --> 0:58:17,638
Your two weeks is up tonight
and Gus is all set to can ya.


820
0:58:17,638 --> 0:58:18,778
You're a dirty liar.


821
0:58:18,778 --> 0:58:21,675
All right. Phone Gus
and find out for yourself.


822
0:58:21,675 --> 0:58:23,528
Well, I'm certainly going to call you
on that one.


823
0:58:23,528 --> 0:58:26,433
Bryant 9483.


824
0:58:26,433 --> 0:58:28,888
We'll just have a little showdown around here.


825
0:58:28,888 --> 0:58:30,78
It will suit me fine.


826
0:58:30,78 --> 0:58:32,959
Hello, I want to speak to Gus Weinbaum.
This is Miss Darling.


827
0:58:32,959 --> 0:58:34,664
Hello, Kitty?


828
0:58:34,664 --> 0:58:36,38
What's on your mind?


829
0:58:36,38 --> 0:58:39,69
What's this I hear about you not renewing my contract
after the show tonight?


830
0:58:39,69 --> 0:58:42,62
Well, you haven't got that quite right, Kitty.


831
0:58:42,62 --> 0:58:45,85
The fact is I got Lou working on a book now...


832
0:58:45,85 --> 0:58:46,941
called "The Boarding School Girls".


833
0:58:46,941 --> 0:58:49,858
And it's gotta have somebody in it that's young.


834
0:58:49,858 --> 0:58:51,957
An ingenue lead, see?


835
0:58:51,957 --> 0:58:55,295
Ingenue lead? I know the stuff the boys
there out front want...


836
0:58:55,295 --> 0:58:57,295
I don't know why you shouldn't write
that book around me.


837
0:58:57,295 --> 0:58:59,327
You're not gonna be left out.


838
0:58:59,327 --> 0:59:3,295
I got you down for a specialty number
and a runway number...


839
0:59:3,295 --> 0:59:5,14
so where do you get in to squawk?


840
0:59:5,14 --> 0:59:7,259
I'm a liar, eh?


841
0:59:7,259 --> 0:59:8,795
I'll show Gus where he gets off.


842
0:59:8,795 --> 0:59:11,148
I'll have a contract in my own terms
in ten minutes.


843
0:59:11,148 --> 0:59:13,836
Hello, girlie, get me Bryant 9400.


844
0:59:13,836 --> 0:59:16,68
Hello, I wanna speak to Dave Holtz.


845
0:59:16,68 --> 0:59:18,544
I'll show the dirty little...
Hello, Dave.


846
0:59:18,544 --> 0:59:19,976
This is Kitty Darling.


847
0:59:19,976 --> 0:59:23,55
Say, Dave, I'm closing
with Parisian Flirts tonight.


848
0:59:23,55 --> 0:59:26,283
How about grabbing yourself a real bet
for your Summer Widows?


849
0:59:26,283 --> 0:59:30,2
Thought I'd give you first crack
instead of fooling around with other stuff.


850
0:59:30,2 --> 0:59:32,988
Well, you better take him.


851
0:59:32,988 --> 0:59:45,29
I got nothing for you.


852
0:59:45,29 --> 0:59:48,811
Twenty managers killed in the rush.
I got plenty of friends in this town.


853
0:59:48,811 --> 0:59:52,686
Ah, save your nickels, you may need them.
None of your wisecracks, Hitch Nelson.


854
0:59:52,686 --> 0:59:55,364
It takes a wise girl to know when to quit
and that's no wisecrack.


855
0:59:55,364 --> 0:59:58,228
Quit what?
Show business. Can't you see you're all washed out?


856
0:59:58,228 --> 1:0:1,23
Why, you...
What have you got left to give'em?


857
1:0:1,23 --> 1:0:4,14
You've been in it for twenty years.
Why kid yourself? You ain't kidding anybody else.


858
1:0:4,14 --> 1:0:5,478
You mind your own business.


859
1:0:5,478 --> 1:0:7,981
I'm not letting any cheap comic
tell me how to run my affairs.


860
1:0:7,981 --> 1:0:11,527
Cheap comic, eh? If it hadn't been for me
telling you how to run your affairs


861
1:0:11,527 --> 1:0:14,679
you'd have been through long ago.
You're a joke. You're just a fat old woman.


862
1:0:14,679 --> 1:0:16,934
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Look at that neck, look at them wrinkles.


863
1:0:16,934 --> 1:0:20,841
You better get wise to yourself and figure out
where the coffee and cake's money is coming from next season.


864
1:0:20,841 --> 1:0:23,181
Right in that room is your meal ticket
from now on.


865
1:0:23,181 --> 1:0:26,661
And you let her marry some dope from the Brooklyn Navy
outright when you needed her most.


866
1:0:26,661 --> 1:0:30,555
She's gonna marry him too, if I have to buy a tin cup
and sell pencils on Broadway.


867
1:0:30,555 --> 1:0:32,383
Not after I have a talk with her tonight.


868
1:0:32,383 --> 1:0:34,566
If you dare to open your trap to her tonight
we're through.


869
1:0:34,566 --> 1:0:35,738
I'm fired, eh?


870
1:0:35,738 --> 1:0:37,885
Well, you're wrong. I quit, see?
So what do you think of that?


871
1:0:37,885 --> 1:0:39,604
I'm sick of seeing you around here.


872
1:0:39,604 --> 1:0:41,67
I guess I got everything out of you I want, babes.


873
1:0:41,67 --> 1:0:44,871
I got plans
and they don't include any old blondes.


874
1:0:44,871 --> 1:0:49,304
Get out! Get out before I kill you.


875
1:0:49,304 --> 1:1:22,164
See you in the show business, beautiful


876
1:1:22,164 --> 1:1:23,867
Mommy, you look tired.


877
1:1:23,867 --> 1:1:25,191
I am a little.


878
1:1:25,191 --> 1:1:28,887
Maybe you'd better rest a little for a while
instead of coming to dinner with us.


879
1:1:28,887 --> 1:1:30,651
I think I'd better.


880
1:1:30,651 --> 1:1:33,826
You two don't want any old ladies along anyway.


881
1:1:33,826 --> 1:1:36,219
You run along to your sailor boy.


882
1:1:36,219 --> 1:1:38,37
Mommy. Mommy.


883
1:1:38,37 --> 1:1:43,951
Tell me, what's the matter?


884
1:1:43,951 --> 1:1:45,816
Mommy, I'm not going to be married.


885
1:1:45,816 --> 1:1:49,8
I'm never going to go away from you now.


886
1:1:49,8 --> 1:1:52,563
You heard Hitch and me
yelling at each other, is that it?


887
1:1:52,563 --> 1:1:56,362
Come on now, cookie.
Don't go taking it that serious.


888
1:1:56,362 --> 1:2:0,697
You know how Hitch and me are,
always rowing about something.


889
1:2:0,697 --> 1:2:2,787
He don't mean what he says half the time.


890
1:2:2,787 --> 1:2:6,26
By tomorrow we'll both of us forget
all about it...


891
1:2:6,26 --> 1:2:7,872
Everything's okay.


892
1:2:7,872 --> 1:2:9,742
Don't let a thing like that get you down.


893
1:2:9,742 --> 1:2:14,476
You run along now see your sailor boy.
Stop being that way.


894
1:2:14,476 --> 1:2:18,88
No, mommy. I'm going to tell Tony
I can't marry him.


895
1:2:18,88 --> 1:2:21,415
But you must marry him, snooks.


896
1:2:21,415 --> 1:2:23,247
After all we talked over?


897
1:2:23,247 --> 1:2:27,783
I'm counting on it.
You don't know how much it means to me.


898
1:2:27,783 --> 1:2:30,376
No, mommy.
I just can't, that's all.


899
1:2:30,376 --> 1:2:31,911
Now you listen to me, young lady.


900
1:2:31,911 --> 1:2:35,168
I'm your ma, and I say you're going right down
to dinner and fix it up.


901
1:2:35,168 --> 1:2:36,904
and there'll be no more talk about it.


902
1:2:36,904 --> 1:2:40,192
All right, mommy.
I'll fix it up.


903
1:2:40,192 --> 1:2:45,124
And when I come to the theater tonight
I wanna be sure you're gonna tell me everything's okay.


904
1:2:45,124 --> 1:2:47,436
It will be.
It will be.


905
1:2:47,436 --> 1:2:50,299
Come on now, kitten.


906
1:2:50,299 --> 1:2:53,83
You gotta do this.
And don't worry about me.


907
1:2:53,83 --> 1:2:56,509
I'm not a black number yet.


908
1:2:56,509 --> 1:5:53,207
I know, mommy.


909
1:5:53,207 --> 1:5:55,224
Boy, that's happy music.


910
1:5:55,224 --> 1:5:57,355
Just for us.


911
1:5:57,355 --> 1:6:0,54
Wanna dance?
No.


912
1:6:0,54 --> 1:6:2,845
Wish you didn't have to work tonight.
We could go to Coney Island.


913
1:6:2,845 --> 1:6:4,285
I don't like Coney Island.


914
1:6:4,285 --> 1:6:6,708
Aw, come on, you don't.
You did the other night.


915
1:6:6,708 --> 1:6:8,461
That was the other night.


916
1:6:8,461 --> 1:6:10,308
What's the matter with you, honey?


917
1:6:10,308 --> 1:6:12,103
Why? Nothing.


918
1:6:12,103 --> 1:6:13,532
Oh, yes there is.


919
1:6:13,532 --> 1:6:16,985
Come on, let's have it.


920
1:6:16,985 --> 1:6:19,237
Tony, I'll tell you.


921
1:6:19,237 --> 1:6:22,96
I don't know how to say it, but...


922
1:6:22,96 --> 1:6:25,44
Tony, I don't want to get married.


923
1:6:25,44 --> 1:6:27,814
Say, don't say things like that,
I got a week heart.


924
1:6:27,814 --> 1:6:30,371
Tony, I mean it.


925
1:6:30,371 --> 1:6:33,334
I like you an awful lot
and all that...


926
1:6:33,334 --> 1:6:36,724
but I just can't think of getting married
right now.


927
1:6:36,724 --> 1:6:40,3
What's the matter, honey?
What's happened?


928
1:6:40,3 --> 1:6:41,566
Nothing.


929
1:6:41,566 --> 1:6:45,911
I don't think you'll be able to understand, but...


930
1:6:45,911 --> 1:6:47,854
Being born on the stage and all


931
1:6:47,854 --> 1:6:51,892
well, getting married and leaving,
it seems to be giving up everything.


932
1:6:51,892 --> 1:6:55,4
You told me the other night
you wanted to get out of the show business.


933
1:6:55,4 --> 1:6:56,774
That's how I thought I felt.


934
1:6:56,774 --> 1:7:1,935
When I come right down to it,
I just can't, that's all.


935
1:7:1,935 --> 1:7:3,593
You'll never know, Tony,


936
1:7:3,593 --> 1:7:6,417
what it feels like to be on the other side
of those footlights.


937
1:7:6,417 --> 1:7:8,904
and to hear them clap and clap for you.


938
1:7:8,904 --> 1:7:11,803
It does something to a girl.


939
1:7:11,803 --> 1:7:14,62
I don't know what.


940
1:7:14,62 --> 1:7:16,789
April, I don't believe a word you're saying.


941
1:7:16,789 --> 1:7:20,26
Either you're lying to me
or else you've just been kidding yourself.


942
1:7:20,26 --> 1:7:22,617
Now, come on,
let's dance and forget about it.


943
1:7:22,617 --> 1:7:25,607
I don't want to dance.


944
1:7:25,607 --> 1:7:29,508
I want you to get it through your head
right now.


945
1:7:29,508 --> 1:7:31,542
This is it, really.


946
1:7:31,542 --> 1:7:34,836
Mother signed a new contract today
for a new show.


947
1:7:34,836 --> 1:7:39,386
And there's a chance
for me to go with her in a splendid part.


948
1:7:39,386 --> 1:7:43,161
If I don't take it
I know I'll be sorry all my life.


949
1:7:43,161 --> 1:7:45,693
Then we'll both be miserable.


950
1:7:45,693 --> 1:7:48,31
But listen, honey.
That's no life for you.


951
1:7:48,31 --> 1:7:53,873
Well, I'm not so sure that married life
in some godforsaken farm is a life for me either.


952
1:7:53,873 --> 1:7:56,7
After all, I'm young.
People tell me I'm pretty.


953
1:7:56,7 --> 1:7:58,379
Here I've got a big chance.


954
1:7:58,379 --> 1:8:0,616
I might be a star.


955
1:8:0,616 --> 1:8:3,703
Now, I ask you, Tony...


956
1:8:3,703 --> 1:8:7,923
what girl wouldn't grab at the chance
to land on Broadway in a big show?


957
1:8:7,923 --> 1:8:10,73
None, I suppose.


958
1:8:10,73 --> 1:8:11,873
Not since you're locked to them.


959
1:8:11,873 --> 1:8:17,567
Let's pray it ended up
with nothing to be locked with right now.


960
1:8:17,567 --> 1:8:22,323
Tony, don't look at me like that.


961
1:8:22,323 --> 1:8:24,127
Makes me feel terrible.


962
1:8:24,127 --> 1:8:27,783
I really think
you're an awfully sweet boy, but


963
1:8:27,783 --> 1:8:32,777
after all, when it comes to love,
why, I've only known you five days.


964
1:8:32,777 --> 1:8:36,376
You think of jumping into something


965
1:8:36,376 --> 1:8:39,434
and giving up a whole career...


966
1:8:39,434 --> 1:8:42,17
Well, Tony, you ought to understand.


967
1:8:42,17 --> 1:8:42,857
Sure.


968
1:8:42,857 --> 1:8:45,633
I mean,
we'll still have lots of fun together.


969
1:8:45,633 --> 1:8:50,239
Just the same. Go to lots of parties.
Why, we might even still be engaged.


970
1:8:50,239 --> 1:8:53,554
No. I wouldn't want to feel
like I'm tying you down.


971
1:8:53,554 --> 1:8:56,773
Guess I'd better go back to my ship.


972
1:8:56,773 --> 1:9:1,587
You mean, enlist again?
Yeah.


973
1:9:1,587 --> 1:9:4,219
Sailing for the West Indies.


974
1:9:4,219 --> 1:9:6,45
I've always wanted to see the West Indies.


975
1:9:6,45 --> 1:9:7,882
But you'll come back.


976
1:9:7,882 --> 1:9:12,533
Sure, some day.


977
1:9:12,533 --> 1:9:15,836
What time is it?


978
1:9:15,836 --> 1:9:17,916
Eight o'clock, almost.


979
1:9:17,916 --> 1:9:19,59
I could just make it if I hurry.


980
1:9:19,59 --> 1:9:22,88
Tony!


981
1:9:22,88 --> 1:9:24,536
You're angry with me.


982
1:9:24,536 --> 1:9:27,52
I didn't want you to be.


983
1:9:27,52 --> 1:9:32,129
Tony, please try not to hate me.


984
1:9:32,129 --> 1:9:34,188
Please try to understand.


985
1:9:34,188 --> 1:9:37,584
This was the best way for us both.


986
1:9:37,584 --> 1:9:40,893
I don't hate you.
I just gotta hurry, that's all.


987
1:9:40,893 --> 1:9:44,576
You ought to be getting down
to your show too, don't you?


988
1:9:44,576 --> 1:9:47,245
I'll walk to the subway with you.
It's on my way.


989
1:9:47,245 --> 1:9:49,352
You'll be late.
I don't care.


990
1:9:49,352 --> 1:10:26,16
Check, please.


991
1:10:26,16 --> 1:10:30,308
Seventh floor, mam.
Good night, Jim, I'll see you in the morning.


992
1:10:30,308 --> 1:10:58,659
Good night, honey.


993
1:10:58,659 --> 1:10:59,766
Well,


994
1:10:59,766 --> 1:11:1,891
thanks for coming down with me, April.


995
1:11:1,891 --> 1:11:52,509
Oh, that was all right.


996
1:11:52,509 --> 1:11:55,839
Well, here's my train.


997
1:11:55,839 --> 1:11:57,576
Bye, April.


998
1:11:57,576 --> 1:12:53,729
Bye, Tony.


999
1:12:53,729 --> 1:12:57,253
Don't cry, kid.
There'll be another one along any minute.


1000
1:12:57,253 --> 1:13:49,796
Cheer up.


1001
1:13:49,796 --> 1:13:52,608
April!


1002
1:13:52,608 --> 1:13:57,419
April!


1003
1:13:57,419 --> 1:14:9,511
April!


1004
1:14:9,511 --> 1:14:14,816
April! April!


1005
1:14:14,816 --> 1:14:21,434
Aw, be quiet!


1006
1:14:21,434 --> 1:14:23,4
Where's April?
Where's April?


1007
1:14:23,4 --> 1:14:27,962
Mother!
What's the matter?


1008
1:14:27,962 --> 1:14:30,688
Help me to my dressing room


1009
1:14:30,688 --> 1:14:32,368
Well I'll be...


1010
1:14:32,368 --> 1:14:34,368
Where did she get?


1011
1:14:34,368 --> 1:14:39,24
Mother, you're sick.
Don't worry about me.


1012
1:14:39,24 --> 1:14:41,746
Is everything all right?
Everything's fine.


1013
1:14:41,746 --> 1:14:43,81
Are you gonna be married right away?


1014
1:14:43,81 --> 1:14:46,5
No, I sent him back to his ship, ma.


1015
1:14:46,5 --> 1:14:49,747
What's this you're saying?
You lie down, you'll feel better.


1016
1:14:49,747 --> 1:14:52,505
Tell me, tell me.
Don't worry, it's all over.


1017
1:14:52,505 --> 1:14:53,818
I sent him away.


1018
1:14:53,818 --> 1:14:56,355
I guess it is jolly life on board.


1019
1:14:56,355 --> 1:14:58,514
It's a good thing we found out in time.


1020
1:14:58,514 --> 1:15:1,106
Oh, nothing matters now but you, mommy.


1021
1:15:1,106 --> 1:15:3,508
We'll always have each other.


1022
1:15:3,508 --> 1:15:6,247
Nothing's ever going to separate us again.


1023
1:15:6,247 --> 1:15:9,707
Oh, my God. What have you done?
What have I done?


1024
1:15:9,707 --> 1:15:11,466
Mommy, you're not well.


1025
1:15:11,466 --> 1:15:15,516
My baby, my little baby.


1026
1:15:15,516 --> 1:15:18,608
Well, this is a swell time to be showing up
for a Saturday night show.


1027
1:15:18,608 --> 1:15:20,388
What's the matter with her?
Drunk?


1028
1:15:20,388 --> 1:15:22,98
Well, what if she is?


1029
1:15:22,98 --> 1:15:26,101
Drunk as a fool,
look at her lying there, the gin-soaked old...


1030
1:15:26,101 --> 1:15:29,78
You let my mother alone!
You men make me sick.


1031
1:15:29,78 --> 1:15:30,537
You don't care about anything


1032
1:15:30,537 --> 1:15:33,24
as long as you can shove somebody
on your filthy stage.


1033
1:15:33,24 --> 1:15:35,136
and make them shake for a bunch of gorillas.


1034
1:15:35,136 --> 1:15:37,336
Yeah? Well that talk don't get me anywhere.


1035
1:15:37,336 --> 1:15:40,168
So far as I'm concerned Kitty Darling's finished.


1036
1:15:40,168 --> 1:15:43,812
Here I talk to Gus Weinbaum
trying to keep her in the show here...


1037
1:15:43,812 --> 1:15:48,382
and look at her, blind, paralyzed,
Saturday night with nobody to take her place.


1038
1:15:48,382 --> 1:15:50,288
I'll take her place.


1039
1:15:50,288 --> 1:15:52,961
I'll get out there and get those gorillas
your money's worth.


1040
1:15:52,961 --> 1:15:54,19
Now what do you think of that?


1041
1:15:54,19 --> 1:15:57,937
Me take a chance on a dumb chorus girl
to fill a specialty number?


1042
1:15:57,937 --> 1:15:59,56
You're crazy!


1043
1:15:59,56 --> 1:16:1,152
Listen, she ain't so dumb.
I've been rehearsing her for weeks.


1044
1:16:1,152 --> 1:16:2,351
She's swell, I'm telling ya.


1045
1:16:2,351 --> 1:16:5,336
Anyway ain't it be better
take a chance with the kid?


1046
1:16:5,336 --> 1:16:8,462
Well, maybe it is.
Hop to it, kid. But you'd better be good.


1047
1:16:8,462 --> 1:16:11,51
Come on, baby, wake up.
Oh, I'll be good all right.


1048
1:16:11,51 --> 1:16:13,163
I'll get out and give them what they want.


1049
1:16:13,163 --> 1:16:16,12
I'll show them, I'll show them!
Now you're talkin'.


1050
1:16:16,12 --> 1:16:19,495
You get out of my way.


1051
1:16:19,495 --> 1:17:44,872
Well I'll be...


1052
1:17:44,872 --> 1:17:46,843
Come on, get out there and play again.
No!


1053
1:17:46,843 --> 1:17:50,569
Come on, get out there.
No!


1054
1:17:50,569 --> 1:17:53,457
Come on, girls, get out there.
Do something.


1055
1:17:53,457 --> 1:17:55,728
Go ahead, get onstage there...


1056
1:17:55,728 --> 1:17:59,64
Come on, you get onstage too.


1057
1:17:59,64 --> 1:18:2,969
Tony!
Tony!


1058
1:18:2,969 --> 1:18:5,115
I came back because I thought,
well, maybe...


1059
1:18:5,115 --> 1:18:9,165
Take me away from this terrible place.


1060
1:18:9,165 --> 1:18:10,397
You mean it?


1061
1:18:10,397 --> 1:18:12,835
I never want to be in the stage again.


1062
1:18:12,835 --> 1:18:14,939
You know, I had a hunch
you weren't telling me the truth.


1063
1:18:14,939 --> 1:18:16,898
Aw, come on, what's it all about?


1064
1:18:16,898 --> 1:18:18,641
It's mother.


1065
1:18:18,641 --> 1:18:21,362
Tony, I can't go away and leave her now.


1066
1:18:21,362 --> 1:18:24,408
She's sick. She needs a home.


1067
1:18:24,408 --> 1:18:26,359
Then let her come with us.
That'll be swell.


1068
1:18:26,359 --> 1:18:29,663
Come on, let's go in and talk to her.
I bet I can make her see it our way.


1069
1:18:29,663 --> 1:18:31,929
It would be wonderful if she would.


1070
1:18:31,929 --> 1:18:35,419
We'll always be together, won't we?


1071
1:18:35,419 --> 1:18:38,902
Yes, honey.
All three of us.


1072
1:18:38,902 --> 1:18:43,991
All three of us.


1073
1:18:43,991 --> 1:20:43,991
