1
0:0:3,9 --> 0:0:10,53
Ok, now that that's out of the way we can
get back to the discussion about behaviour.


2
0:0:10,53 --> 0:0:15,2
When you think about certain things, that
you usually don't think about, it may make


3
0:0:15,2 --> 0:0:21,43
sense to you intellectually. But your habits
are established prior to the intellect, prior


4
0:0:21,43 --> 0:0:27,65
to what you call logic and reason. And so
you have feelings about things, feelings and


5
0:0:27,65 --> 0:0:32,34
pride, you know? Like my son was number 1
in his class and all that sorta thing, if


6
0:0:32,34 --> 0:0:37,89
you study your irrelevant subjects, as a fashion
designer, or an interior decorater. or a lawyer,


7
0:0:37,89 --> 0:0:42,78
it wouldn't make any difference to me. And
there was another 10 in his class, all know


8
0:0:42,78 --> 0:0:46,18
nothing in his class, it wouldn't make very
much difference. What makes the difference


9
0:0:46,18 --> 0:0:51,11
is whether or not you can relate, and whether
or not they read up on subjects the class


10
0:0:51,11 --> 0:0:56,28
may not be interested in. I don't care if
you're a liberated female and you walk around


11
0:0:56,28 --> 0:0:59,59
asking, your friends what they think of me
 - they don't buy it at all - so you dumb


12
0:0:59,59 --> 0:1:4,64
the view point, I would say you're a tremendous
insufficiency. And a lot of people go a lot


13
0:1:4,64 --> 0:1:9,56
of places, and they sit down and they listen
to ideas, and they won't make a decision.


14
0:1:9,56 --> 0:1:18,79
They'll turn to the person next to them and
say "what do you think of that guy?" you know?


15
0:1:18,79 --> 0:1:19,649
and they forget it. And so a lot of people
are not habituated, to what you call 'think


16
0:1:19,649 --> 0:1:22,909
for themselves,' or evaluate the system and
say "well I don't know enough about it - 


17
0:1:22,909 --> 0:1:28,429
I accept some of the things, and some things
I reject." So just remember that prior to


18
0:1:28,429 --> 0:1:34,39
reading books on semantics, and Vedlesm, and
social phenomena, and social psychology, you


19
0:1:34,39 --> 0:1:39,319
get habits established at home. Your brother,
your father, your dad, you have all those


20
0:1:39,319 --> 0:1:44,6
things, and you have social habits. The guy
says "birthday card" you know - and you do


21
0:1:44,6 --> 0:1:47,56
those things, and then you read all the books
on semantics and you go "what the hell's a


22
0:1:47,56 --> 0:1:52,79
birthday card?" - "Happy new year?" - You
don't control the new year. You know - if


23
0:1:52,79 --> 0:1:57,489
you sat up in a clowd and you arranged the
weather and the sea and the climate - and


24
0:1:57,489 --> 0:1:59,459
then I'd know - you say "you're gunna have
a good new year," - he says "how's that?"


25
0:1:59,459 --> 0:2:2,939
 - you say "there's a batch of lenses back
there, and things you need - they're all back


26
0:2:2,939 --> 0:2:6,319
there for you." That promises a better new
year. And then John says "you know there's


27
0:2:6,319 --> 0:2:10,39
a lot of matt trucks in town, you can't know
that you're gunna have a happy new year."


28
0:2:10,39 --> 0:2:15,4
You might. You might build something fantastic
with the lenses, so the glasses may snap and


29
0:2:15,4 --> 0:2:19,9
and can blind you life. You can't know those
things. Alls you can know is under certain


30
0:2:19,9 --> 0:2:24,629
conditions, and precautions, you can deminish
the possibility of accidents. But they are


31
0:2:24,629 --> 0:2:29,299
with us, those things are with us. And so,
our earlier habits establish our emotional


32
0:2:29,299 --> 0:2:37,69
set, and our emotional set is dominant, over
your knowledge of semantics, reason, problem


33
0:2:37,69 --> 0:2:42,849
solving, in school - problem solving - you
know, you see 2 people in an argument, and


34
0:2:42,849 --> 0:2:47,59
they're fighting, physically. Ya say - would
you move in and try to say - "listen you fellas,


35
0:2:47,59 --> 0:2:51,709
ya know, why don't you sit and reason together?"
you know, "would you mind your own business?"


36
0:2:51,709 --> 0:2:56,689
What would you do? And a person says - a person
writes down, well this is what I would do,


37
0:2:56,689 --> 0:3:2,56
well actually, when you're involved with somebody,
emotionally, and somebody walks over and says


38
0:3:2,56 --> 0:3:5,909
something, do you listen to what the other
person says objectively? Or do you tend to


39
0:3:5,909 --> 0:3:10,79
take sides with the person you're familiar
with? and the person you know? Somehow, whenever


40
0:3:10,79 --> 0:3:13,579
my kid got into an argument with somebody
else, he always seemed to be right. That's


41
0:3:13,579 --> 0:3:19,719
what I mean, we have that kind of prejudice
condition in ourselves. And it takes a long


42
0:3:19,719 --> 0:3:24,749
time to undo that. You have to have a set
about people, and it's a hard set to come


43
0:3:24,749 --> 0:3:30,99
by. You can get along with people so long
as you get along with them, and in certain


44
0:3:30,99 --> 0:3:34,9
areas you won't get along with them, and that's
a fact. And certain areas some people don't


45
0:3:34,9 --> 0:3:38,73
want to change, because they can't afford
it emotionally. Is there anybody that doesn't


46
0:3:38,73 --> 0:3:43,459
know what that means? They can't afford to
change emotionally. You know, if my girlfriend


47
0:3:43,459 --> 0:3:48,189
put her arm around me, and I say "what's the
matter? You insecure?" You know, and if I


48
0:3:48,189 --> 0:3:52,879
put my arm around her and she says "are you
insecure?" So you don't touch, even though


49
0:3:52,879 --> 0:3:57,829
you want to touch, if you want to touch, "are
you insecure?" Do we put our arms around other


50
0:3:57,829 --> 0:4:2,859
people, because they put their arms around
us and say "yes, I do feel that way" you know,


51
0:4:2,859 --> 0:4:9,73
do we enquire this constant reassurance? And
I would say 1 measure of concern of another


52
0:4:9,73 --> 0:4:15,81
person for any other person, is the services
they attend to render that other person. If


53
0:4:15,81 --> 0:4:20,459
you were studying botany, and the guy that
liked you tried to facilitate that, and get


54
0:4:20,459 --> 0:4:25,0
you the equipment you couldn't get and try
to - if you wanted to go in the other room


55
0:4:25,0 --> 0:4:28,889
and paint, and the person will say "well,
you know, fine" and they sit here and they


56
0:4:28,889 --> 0:4:32,69
read a book, but they don't bother you for
doing it. That would be more important to


57
0:4:32,69 --> 0:4:38,77
me than putting your arms around one another,
it'd be much more important to share in that


58
0:4:38,77 --> 0:4:48,889
general area. Is that locked? To me, it'd
be much more important to do that. But if


59
0:4:48,889 --> 0:4:53,61
you did that, suppose you did that to a person,
suppose you were very extensional to the person,


60
0:4:53,61 --> 0:4:58,91
but no sweet nothings, you'd lose contact
with that person, because their habits of


61
0:4:58,91 --> 0:5:4,6
thought - in other words, if you - if a person
trips and falls, and you help them up, bandage


62
0:5:4,6 --> 0:5:7,949
their knee, and then head off. They say "oh
thank you very much" - "I'm sure you'd do


63
0:5:7,949 --> 0:5:13,259
the same for me, I don't need that" you know
 - "there's something odd about that character."


64
0:5:13,259 --> 0:5:20,28
And so, reading on semantics and then applying
at this kind of intellectual sanity, may not


65
0:5:20,28 --> 0:5:25,66
come off right. You may see in the behavior
of other people that you're talking to, a


66
0:5:25,66 --> 0:5:31,2
kind of an alien look. Do you know what I
mean? And they antagonise you, because here


67
0:5:31,2 --> 0:5:36,8
you are trying to provide them with some information
that you feel may be relevant to their lifestyle.


68
0:5:36,8 --> 0:5:41,979
And they turn around and say "that sounds
communist" or whatever the hell they say.


69
0:5:41,979 --> 0:5:45,66
They say things like that "why don't you go
back to Russia?" Here the guy dropped a package


70
0:5:45,66 --> 0:5:48,83
 - "could you help me put everything together?"
He says "what are you a communist?" Ya see,


71
0:5:48,83 --> 0:5:53,96
I see it in that sense. They can't always
put things together. And so the way they look


72
0:5:53,96 --> 0:5:58,229
at you when you're talking to them, causes
what I thought you could call it 'unconscious


73
0:5:58,229 --> 0:6:4,949
resentment' or what you would call, seemingly
just speak to the person and it seems to bounce


74
0:6:4,949 --> 0:6:9,0
off their ears, they don't seem to understand,
and then you plead with them. Says "I didn't


75
0:6:9,0 --> 0:6:14,37
mean anything harmful by that, I only attempted
to assist" - he says "I didn't ask you, mind


76
0:6:14,37 --> 0:6:18,729
your own fucking business." Y'know. "What
are you interested in music?" - "What are


77
0:6:18,729 --> 0:6:23,6
you? An FBI agent?" Y'know. They don't always
like to answer to other people. And so, a


78
0:6:23,6 --> 0:6:27,599
lot of people are very private, and the reason
that they are is because, when you tell me


79
0:6:27,599 --> 0:6:30,25
that your kid brother was in a mental institution
for 3 years - y'know - "I'm sorry to hear


80
0:6:30,25 --> 0:6:36,2
that, is he well?" When I get mad at you 
- a person says "you notice something occasionally?"


81
0:6:36,2 --> 0:6:40,97
 - "Her kid brother was in a hospital for
3 years," and I use it against you, and then


82
0:6:40,97 --> 0:6:44,449
your friend says, "I didn't know your kid
was" - "how'd you find out?" - "Fresco" because


83
0:6:44,449 --> 0:6:49,0
when I get mad at you, I might say, "not that
I've got anything against it, but her farther


84
0:6:49,0 --> 0:6:55,819
was criminally insane. Murdered 9 children."
 - "I knew that when she puts coffee down


85
0:6:55,819 --> 0:7:0,5
on the table she shakes a little bit." So,
the point is, people that have any kind of


86
0:7:0,5 --> 0:7:4,47
resentment against you, will notice that your
eyes buldge when somebody's talking. They


87
0:7:4,47 --> 0:7:12,759
will see that. They see it. They have need
to see it. And so, being rational is a tough


88
0:7:12,759 --> 0:7:18,0
project, you launch a batch of crap at people
John, hurl it out - then they go *fart sound*


89
0:7:18,0 --> 0:7:22,99
and you say "I see." But if you say "try to
help the goddamn bastard and look what the


90
0:7:22,99 --> 0:7:28,3
hell I get, he damages my car." That's looking
for justice. So what you're supposed to do


91
0:7:28,3 --> 0:7:36,139
is just throw it out. "Women's lib? Oh shit,
y'know? How did this get here?" - y'know 


92
0:7:36,139 --> 0:7:42,259
- "how are you Fresco?" - "I don't like that
much liberation. Besides women are naturally


93
0:7:42,259 --> 0:7:47,849
weaker." Ya know, the whole idea is that,
they don't want a package, they don't need


94
0:7:47,849 --> 0:7:54,83
it. And also when a female picks up a gun
and hits a moving target continuously, y'know,


95
0:7:54,83 --> 0:8:0,43
a guy says "A lot of male arm on her" - y'know
 - it's not a god damn thing, not a god damn


96
0:8:0,43 --> 0:8:5,99
thing. A female on the motorcycle in a barrel
is probably a lesbian - ya know what I mean?


97
0:8:5,99 --> 0:8:11,979
You know, it's easier for them to understand.
To become liberated, the need a lot of shades


98
0:8:11,979 --> 0:8:19,389
of grey, and even if a person is a lesbian,
so what? You know what I mean? Cause everybody,


99
0:8:19,389 --> 0:8:25,55
everybody has a certain amount of dualistic
behavior. Sometimes I see a guy that I haven't


100
0:8:25,55 --> 0:8:30,229
seen in a long time and I wanna put my arms
around him, I'm glad to see him. But I don't


101
0:8:30,229 --> 0:8:34,52
wanna kiss his cheek because I wasn't brought
up in Turkey. My farther does that, he kisses


102
0:8:34,52 --> 0:8:38,4
a guy on both cheeks and hugs - and they walk
around brothers - walking around with their


103
0:8:38,4 --> 0:8:42,59
arms around eachother in Turkey. And they
weep, if a Turk hears that another guy had


104
0:8:42,59 --> 0:8:48,52
a little trouble they take out their hankerchiefs
and they weep. And their political leaders


105
0:8:48,52 --> 0:8:53,7
when they get up and make a speech, "we're
losing land and territory of Turkey" and they


106
0:8:53,7 --> 0:8:58,59
weep, they really weep. And they weep like
that, and nobody looks at them as [unknown


107
0:8:58,59 --> 0:9:6,56
word]. And this is a pattern. Now, infact
a lot of men that [unknown word] the junior


108
0:9:6,56 --> 0:9:11,86
feelings about something, sometimes are conditioned
not to weep. But they weep in here, which


109
0:9:11,86 --> 0:9:16,71
is pretty rough, sometimes it's better to
weep. Sometimes it's better to physically


110
0:9:16,71 --> 0:9:22,29
weep. But it's a sign of weakness. See? And
you wouldn't rather scream it, if your brother


111
0:9:22,29 --> 0:9:27,1
was run over by a matt truck. They would remember
that. See? If you don't seem to remember the


112
0:9:27,1 --> 0:9:33,6
fact that you were very close to the person
and you couldn't handle it. You didn't any


113
0:9:33,6 --> 0:9:39,78
tools for handling that situation emotionally.
Remember that people are not gunna sit back


114
0:9:39,78 --> 0:9:43,96
and say you know I'd like to understand her
behavior from her point of view. Or his behavior


115
0:9:43,96 --> 0:9:47,75
from his point of view. They don't do that.
Nor do they really Jacque, so whenever you


116
0:9:47,75 --> 0:9:50,2
yack at people, you're yacking at them in
given culture, in the middle ages. And all


117
0:9:50,2 --> 0:9:57,65
the reinforces are not in your hands. But
if you had a yacht, or something where you


118
0:9:57,65 --> 0:10:1,84
hoard all those boys together to work with
and yelled, and said "hey, we're all going


119
0:10:1,84 --> 0:10:6,63
out this Sunday." And say "gosh anybody that
can get a yacht like that has gotta be darn


120
0:10:6,63 --> 0:10:10,46
smart." He says "what do you think?" You say
"well, I'm a member of the John Burts society"


121
0:10:10,46 --> 0:10:14,9
Y'say "where can I get [unknown]? he's got
a yacht, he's got an [unknown], he must know


122
0:10:14,9 --> 0:10:21,7
something." But here you are, you know, peddling
pencils on a corner and talking about the


123
0:10:21,7 --> 0:10:26,24
insufficiency of congress. And they figured
"jesus christ, how come he's peddling pencils


124
0:10:26,24 --> 0:10:32,6
on a corner?" You see? And so, the idea Joe
is that people don't want to listen. They


125
0:10:32,6 --> 0:10:37,6
don't have any need for it, and you, or John
or me sometimes we don't symbolise anything


126
0:10:37,6 --> 0:10:42,61
that they wouldn't want to look up to. They
do that with very famous people - "what kind


127
0:10:42,61 --> 0:10:47,24
of coffee do you drink? How many cups of coffee
do you drink a day? Do you ever drink tea?


128
0:10:47,24 --> 0:10:52,61
Do you have sleepless nights?" And so normal
people, try to get next to famous people,


129
0:10:52,61 --> 0:10:58,15
or rich people, or important people, cause
they feel a little bit like get on, you know,


130
0:10:58,15 --> 0:11:3,6
and they'll get in with that crowd, and get
the extensionality of that system. So here


131
0:11:3,6 --> 0:11:9,31
you've got hell of a lot of insecure rats,
running round, trying to make contact with


132
0:11:9,31 --> 0:11:15,43
rats that know where the pile of food is.
And the rat says "yeh! There's a pile of food!"


133
0:11:15,43 --> 0:11:19,56
and the guy says "gee it's 800 feet high,
I haven't had anything to eat for 3 days."


134
0:11:19,56 --> 0:11:25,23
A guy says "see that fence around the pile?
It's private property. There's also a proximaty


135
0:11:25,23 --> 0:11:32,87
mechanism on the fence, with a security guard.
But an act of human kindness should be committed


136
0:11:32,87 --> 0:11:38,27
most royal - the guy gives him a sandwich
or half a sandwich. So the idea in our culture


137
0:11:38,27 --> 0:11:46,42
is that the rules of the game are set so that
male and female have antagonisms inherant


138
0:11:46,42 --> 0:11:52,5
in the culture. Is there anybody disagrees
with that? The culture produces automatically,


139
0:11:52,5 --> 0:11:57,89
those antagonistic feelings. And also, you
can see it - if you wanna take the time out


140
0:11:57,89 --> 0:12:3,15
 - children growing up. "hey" you know "what
are you playing with the girls for?" I'm talking


141
0:12:3,15 --> 0:12:10,19
about when you're 4 or 5 years old. That kind
of thing, you know "momma, he likes my sister"


142
0:12:10,19 --> 0:12:14,34
I didn't know why, why older guys want to
go out with girls, you can't have any fun


143
0:12:14,34 --> 0:12:18,96
with a girl, you know, you throw your ball,
they can't even catch it. And they won't go


144
0:12:18,96 --> 0:12:24,1
off the high board, *moaning sound* what the
hell are you hanging around with girls for?


145
0:12:24,1 --> 0:12:29,51
And so, they are right in their set the way
they're brought up, the values are different.


146
0:12:29,51 --> 0:12:36,83
Now if a girl climbs a tree - the other girls
 - you know "she's an odd one" if you have


147
0:12:36,83 --> 0:12:41,72
a collection of snakes, when you're young,
you know, your girlfriends, you know, they


148
0:12:41,72 --> 0:12:47,39
have a reaction. But it isn't typically female,
it's typically cultural. There any girls here


149
0:12:47,39 --> 0:12:52,7
that collected snakes of any kind, or ever
had any snakes? Any girls here that ever picked


150
0:12:52,7 --> 0:12:59,96
up a frog? Slimey frog? You pick up a frog?
Snakes - did you Linda? - Yeah but [unknown]


151
0:12:59,96 --> 0:13:7,76
Alright, right out of the pond. Have you?
Have I? I have but I wouldn't - Are you conditioned


152
0:13:7,76 --> 0:13:11,42
against that kind of thing? Yeah, I don't
like snakes or frogs. Whether it's poisonous


153
0:13:11,42 --> 0:13:16,26
or non-poisonous? According to your conditioning?
Do you realise that? Oh, very small - Ok 


154
0:13:16,26 --> 0:13:22,45
- picking up snakes - do you believe you can
change in that area if you wanted, if you


155
0:13:22,45 --> 0:13:25,22
had need to? Yeah but I don't choose to. You
don't choose to? Ok, that's your problem with


156
0:13:25,22 --> 0:13:29,35
other people - you may say things to them,
and they don't choose to, meaning that forces


157
0:13:29,35 --> 0:13:38,68
that act upon them force that decision. Is
that right? You know, if you go out with a


158
0:13:38,68 --> 0:13:40,94
guy - if a girl goes out with a guy, and she
likes the guy, she wants to go to bed with


159
0:13:40,94 --> 0:13:47,77
him, and she puts her arm around him, she
tries opening his fly and reaches for him,


160
0:13:47,77 --> 0:13:51,5
you know? The guy is - the guy doesn't feel
comfortable, because it doesn't fit the pattern,


161
0:13:51,5 --> 0:13:56,5
it's far afield of the pattern. He says "there
must be something wrong with her" see? And


162
0:13:56,5 --> 0:14:0,78
so - but if a guy does it, "that's how men
are" you know what I mean? "You know how men


163
0:14:0,78 --> 0:14:6,55
are. Everybody knows that." So, what you're
dealing with's a set of patterns they're all


164
0:14:6,55 --> 0:14:11,62
established, the patterns are established.
You know, if you squeze your girlfriend's


165
0:14:11,62 --> 0:14:15,92
butt while she's getting into a car, it's
alright. But if I were in a supermarket and


166
0:14:15,92 --> 0:14:21,75
my girlfriend was reaching for my balls, you
know? I'd say you know "not here!" Because


167
0:14:21,75 --> 0:14:26,14
I can't sit around like that and the supervisor
says "alright, [unknown]." Whereas the people


168
0:14:26,14 --> 0:14:30,96
in the supermarket - "notice that guy with
the captains hat and the beard" if they see


169
0:14:30,96 --> 0:14:36,33
you on the radio once or anything like that,
it doesn't take very long especially - and


170
0:14:36,33 --> 0:14:41,87
so, in the world today if you wanna make contact
with people you have to simulate certain values


171
0:14:41,87 --> 0:14:46,94
on the outside, I mean, you have to wear that
mask. Now I don't think people are gunna turn


172
0:14:46,94 --> 0:14:52,42
around and say "how liberated are you?" and
you say - you go like that, and you fart 


173
0:14:52,42 --> 0:14:59,64
- no, now a girl that does that especially
a respectable girl, you know, from a good


174
0:14:59,64 --> 0:15:5,53
home, that's not too liberating, that's sick.
The difference between sickness and liberation


175
0:15:5,53 --> 0:15:11,61
with clothes, alright John there's your major
problem. Major problem is that people don't


176
0:15:11,61 --> 0:17:11,61
choose to change because they don't see the
extensionality of the system.
