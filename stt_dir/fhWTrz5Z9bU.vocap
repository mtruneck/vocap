###0 MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for being here this afternoon.
###4 And today we're pleased to welcome
###6 Dr. T, a very special guest from Minneapolis.
###11 Dr. T was born in Jerusalem, Israel.
###15 He has two doctorate degrees.
###18 One, in Chiropractic, and the other one, in General Medicine.
###24 Dr. T's specialties is in health, medicine, nutrition,
###30 and sustainability.
###33 Dr. T had been traveling extensively, offering
###37 medical care and studying nutrition practices
###42 around the world.
###44 In the West, we are dealing with all kinds of stress,
###48 mostly related to work.
###51 Even Google, being the best company to work for in 2014
###56 according to the "Fortune" magazine-- we still
###60 feel the stress, with a smiley face.
###63 
###67 On the other hand, the people in Nepal,
###70 they have a different type of stress in life,
###72 and that's what I call everyday life stress.
###77 And, for example, they have one of the slowest internet
###82 services in the world, and the internet
###86 was introduced to Nepal in 1994.
###90 And even as of today, yet their internet speed
###96 is the second slowest in the world, just behind Libya.
###102 And then, the second problem they have
###103 is, on average, most people only get
###108 about 9 to 12 hours of electricity per day.
###113 So, you can imagine living in that type of an environment,
###116 and even before these challenges in life.
###121 But the people in Nepal are still
###123 pretty happy and extremely friendly.
###127 And you can find, in their greeting tradition,
###134 for example, they do not shake hands or hug.
###139 What they would do is they close their palm,
###142 and then bow their head, and say Namaste.
###146 So today, we're lucky to have Dr. T to share his childhood
###152 experience in Nepal and then what
###155 we can learn from these people about the health and also
###160 the stress issue.
###162 And then with that, I would like to welcome Dr. T to Google.
###166 
###171 DR. TEL-OREN: Thank you.
###172 I know that you're here for many reasons.
###174 Some of you are here because you want to know about stress,
###177 and some are here because you want
###178 to know about the Himalayas, and some
###180 want to know about the skin, and some
###183 want to know about vitality.
###186 So, how do we weave all those things together
###188 in just a short talk?
###191 Normally, each one of them could be a two or three hour
###193 discussion.
###194 So, we have to be a little more concise
###197 and be rapid in our presentation.
###199 And we need to realize what's truly important in life.
###203 What is it makes people really stressed?
###205 Why are we stressed?
###207 Because we take on more than we can handle.
###210 Because we have a lot of expectations
###212 that are put upon us or that we decide to adopt.
###216 Because we want to Excel.
###217 Because we want to get appreciation.
###219 Because today people would love us for what we manufacture,
###223 what we produce.
###224 So, we have to get results.
###226 We are very result oriented in our society
###228 and if we don't perform according
###231 to expectation, distress.
###234 Even if we have the best food in the world and the places
###237 to get suntan, it's not enough.
###241 So, we need to start thinking about what's
###243 really important to engage in and to adopt above and beyond
###250 the day-to-day routine of taking more and more responsibilities
###255 upon ourselves, which is the main cause for stress in people
###260 who are productive, and young, and relatively healthy.
###265 Of course, when you have stress, you
###268 have the physiological and psychological consequence.
###272 Many people have back problems and insomnia.
###276 Many people have stomach upset and headaches.
###280 A lot of people have palpitation anxiety attack.
###283 A lot of young people that I see are
###286 suffering from mood disorders.
###289 They simply can't handle the pressure of the daily life.
###293 And that's not their fault.
###294 It's the fault of our physiology.
###297 We're not made for that.
###298 We are hardwired, in our brain, to handle
###302 quick and severe or extensive stress, that
###309 then abates and disappears.
###311 That's what we are designed to have in nature.
###314 And we all came from nature, like it or not.
###317 We came from a place where we had severe risk of death,
###321 instantly, and then 10 minutes later that risk passes away.
###326 And if we survived it, we can relax.
###331 Today we don't have that opportunity.
###334 If the stress lasts too long and it is too severe,
###338 the results are extreme.
###341 They've done studies with mice and they
###344 saw that when the mice are under severe stress for too long,
###348 after just several hours of extreme threat,
###353 those mice had three severe anatomical changes.
###358 In volution of the reticuloendothelial system,
###360 meaning everything shrinks in the immune system organs.
###363 Like the thymus, shrinks rapidly and you could see it.
###370 The adrenal glands, which are associated with stress,
###373 with the output of stress hormones, starts swelling
###378 and you see it rapidly, visibly, anatomical growth, hypertrophy,
###385 of the adrenals.
###386 And the last of the visible signs, is wounds and open sores
###393 and bleeding ulcers in the digestive system.
###397 Now this is visible.
###398 Imagine what is not visible.
###401 Imagine all the little things, the changes,
###403 that happen in the body with our circulation, with our hormones,
###407 with our neurology.
###409 All those things that happen that are not visible in mice
###412 within just a few hours of severe stress.
###415 And this is what we are enduring in our society
###418 because our stress is interminable.
###421 It continues, unabated.
###425 We don't know when to shut it down
###426 because our responsibilities and the tasks
###430 we have to engage in on a daily basis don't end.
###434 On the contrary, we keep adding on and on and on because we
###437 want to excel, we want to get respect and appreciation
###440 from the jobs, from the peers, from our friends,
###443 from our family.
###444 Everybody expects something out of us.
###447 We just don't know where to let go and how to let go.
###452 So, we go to all of those methods of stress management
###456 because we have those symptoms.
###457 We can't sleep at night, we need stimulants
###459 to stay up during the day because we're
###461 so tired when we wake up.
###463 If we wake up from a night of no sleep
###468 If you need to drink coffee or take any stimulants to feel
###473 that you can go through the day, you're
###476 not getting enough sleep or poor quality of sleep.
###479 And most people today need stimulants every day,
###482 whether it's caffeine, coffee, chocolate,
###485 or other such stimulants.
###487 What are they doing?
###488 They're pressing on the gas pedal when the tank is empty.
###493 They're forcing us into the stimulation that
###496 resembles a stress response, which tells us
###501 that we have a little more energy.
###503 Our blood supply is slightly richer in glucose,
###506 so we can bring more energy to the muscles
###509 for the fight-or-flight that doesn't exist.
###513 And that is the stimulant that we always
###515 take thinking it's good for us because it makes us feel high,
###519 but it's only necessary because without it we plummet,
###524 and we get tired, we crash throughout each day.
###528 Sounds familiar to some of you, doesn't it?
###531 That is not where you want to be because over time all
###535 of these conditions associated with the physiological and
###540 emotional stress are going to simply make
###544 you either fat, or tired, chronically fatigued,
###549 or having chronically suppressed immune system resulting
###554 in cancer.
###556 People always go through these three phases
###558 of general adaptation syndrome.
###560 The first phase is just being under stress
###562 but not knowing it.
###564 The second, is having the stress and having those symptoms
###567 of fatigue, and aches, and pains,
###569 and digestive complaints, et cetera.
###573 The third phase is when there's complete systematic break down.
###578 The adrenals are overwhelmed.
###580 They cannot create more of these hormonal outputs of stress.
###584 At that point, people either develop
###586 chronic fatigue syndrome or fybromyalgia,
###588 they become bedridden, they totally
###590 lose their functionality, or they
###593 have other severe chronic condition, or they get cancer.
###597 That's the third phase.
###598 Most people today who are under significant stress,
###601 are already high on the second phase
###604 of this general adaptation syndrome, also known as GAS,
###610 and they are very dangerously close to phase three.
###614 I see today a lot of young people in their '20s and '30s
###618 who already are coming into phase three
###622 and wondering where it came from.
###623 Not realizing how much of it is related to the stress
###627 that they're suffering from.
###628 And this is the stress that is typically
###630 in affluent countries.
###633 We are all suffering from affluenza.
###634 
###637 And we really want to change that.
###639 We want to start moving towards simplicity.
###643 It's not always easy when we have everything available right
###647 in front of us to just pick and choose.
###650 Sometimes too many choices is a stressful thing.
###653 You want to just be told, do this.
###655 You don't want to know too much information.
###657 Just give me what I need.
###660 But you have too many options.
###662 That is a stress because you want
###664 to live life to the fullest.
###666 You want to experience everything.
###668 While people in other countries don't have that opportunity.
###672 People in Nepal are always having very few options
###677 to eat, to see.
###679 They never travel much.
###680 They never go on an airplane, they can't afford it.
###684 So, they stay in one village in the remote rural Nepal
###687 and they never get out of that environment.
###689 Maybe once or twice a year they would travel all the way
###692 to Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal.
###696 And that's about it.
###698 Those people are always seeing the same trees,
###701 the same houses, the same mountains.
###704 They wake up and everything is predictable.
###707 Now you would say-- and you'd be correct-- is predictability
###710 always a good thing?
###712 Is nature predictable?
###714 And you'd be right to ask that because the answer is no.
###718 And I've never said that their life
###720 is perfect out there in Nepal.
###722 They have a lot of their own challenges.
###725 But their existence appears to you to be predictable.
###731 In reality, it's not.
###733 They have constant change in their life.
###736 Every day brings numerous, unpredictable events.
###740 They never know if the food will be good, if there will be food.
###745 They never know who they're going
###747 to meet coming to visit their village.
###749 They have a lot of changes in their environment.
###752 Not just with the seasons, but with survival.
###755 Every time they walk on the trail, something happens.
###758 They might have to confront a mule or a cow
###761 or water Buffalo that might push them off the trail.
###766 Or they may just have a landslide that will take down
###771 a whole village and they would have to somehow make do.
###774 They're always on the survival mode without even knowing it.
###779 But it's a different type of survival mode.
###781 It's the kind that brings change continuously,
###785 where change is expected where the unpredictable is expected.
###791 Therefore, it is not so stressful
###793 when you see new things.
###795 Let's contrast that with Americans
###798 who are accustomed to their routine.
###800 Every day they have to get in their car,
###801 drive, go from 9:00 to 5:00, drive back,
###804 stop on the way in the coffee shop, go to get some bagels.
###808 Those people are doing exactly the same thing every day.
###811 They are creatures of habit.
###813 But as soon as something happens that is different,
###816 they can't handle the stress.
###819 They go berserk.
###821 So, they need to drink alcohol or take some pot.
###825 Drink, smoke some pot to feel more relaxed
###828 because they can't handle change.
###831 In nature, we have to handle change
###833 because from every bush might be an animal jumping out
###838 at us-- under every tree.
###841 Or every time we have to run away we have to be prepared,
###844 have to be alert, all the time.
###848 When you get used to that constant change,
###850 you stop being stressed.
###853 So, this is one thing I like to teach people,
###857 to keep making your life varied.
###860 Increase variety, complexity, in your life.
###864 Allow things not to be simple, while you live a simpler
###867 lifestyle.
###869 Sounds like a contradiction, but it's the truth.
###873 Simplify your life in what you take on, but increase
###880 the variety so that you are accustomed
###882 to the unpredictable.
###884 Go outdoors into nature.
###887 Many people will tell you that to reduce stress
###890 you have to either meditate, or do mindfulness,
###893 or hypnotherapy, or guided imagery, or Tai Chi.
###901 There are so many techniques that
###902 are being told to you that are great to manage your stress.
###908 They don't treat the underlying cause of stress,
###910 but they help you manage it.
###912 And they're good, but one thing on the list is go to nature.
###918 Learn from nature.
###921 Your body, physiologically, is adapted
###924 through tens of thousands of years and hundreds of thousands
###927 of years to the natural environment from which we came.
###932 Eat according to nature because any time
###935 you have a slight disorder, anytime you
###937 have a slight nutritional deficiency,
###939 anytime you're exposed to toxins, all of those
###943 are related to our departure from what's natural.
###948 We need to try to correct that.
###951 And in nature we have extreme variety
###953 of foods that are made by nature that we
###957 would have had in nature in their natural pristine state.
###961 Today, how much of a variety do we have in food?
###965 You could go to all of Google cafeterias,
###967 you would still not have more than 50 foods covering just
###972 about the whole gamut.
###974 50 vegetables, and spices, and grains, and legumes,
###978 and few other things Not that much.
###980 But if you go foraging in nature,
###983 as our predecessors did-- our ancestors foraged
###987 all the time before agricultural age--
###990 you would have unlimited number of foods
###993 to choose from all the time.
###996 And you would have the unpredictability
###998 of what would be available, which keeps you
###1001 on your toes in a healthy way.
###1004 It keeps you excited about life.
###1006 So, please bring variety into your life and please
###1010 go to nature to learn from her, and not
###1014 just to use her as a shelter from stress.
###1018 And if you do go into nature, then you
###1021 start learning other things because you
###1023 will see the different animals and people that co-inhabit
###1029 that natural environment, and you see what they do
###1032 and what they don't do.
###1033 That is true for learning from other people.
###1035 What do they do?
###1036 What do they not do?
###1038 And what makes them healthier than us,
###1041 is always an important question.
###1043 You know that 79 million Americans have pre-diabetes.
###1048 
###1050 That's a huge number.
###1052 You know that hundreds of thousands of children
###1055 are being diagnosed, before age 10, with cancer.
###1061 Pediatric cancer is a fast growing trend
###1065 and most hospitals are building special wings
###1070 for childhood cancer.
###1073 And we have one out of three or four children on drugs
###1077 or diagnosed with a disease.
###1080 And almost all the children today
###1082 have some allergies, or asthma, autoimmune disease,
###1086 or immune suppression condition that will never [INAUDIBLE]
###1090 of children.
###1091 
###1095 So, many children are diagnosed with learning
###1097 disorders, and autism, and other conditions that
###1102 didn't used to be so popular.
###1104 Once, it was 1 in 10,000 children--
###1107 not too long ago, a few decades-- and now
###1110 1 out of 49 children are diagnosed as having autism.
###1114 What's happening to the next generation?
###1117 Many of you are going to have children,
###1118 if you don't have them already.
###1120 What's happening to our children that makes them suddenly
###1124 the sickest children have ever been?
###1126 Shouldn't we learn something about what
###1129 is happening in other countries to compare and contrast and see
###1134 what we can learn to save a whole generation of children
###1137 in this country?
###1139 How do we do that?
###1141 How do we learn about the health of our children
###1143 when they're all exposed to the same factors,
###1148 such as we don't have a control group.
###1149 If we want to do a scientific study.
###1152 We can't.
###1154 We have to go somewhere else where the children have not
###1158 been exposed to what children here have been exposed to.
###1162 There have been studies with children
###1164 who have moved from one country to another,
###1167 and they saw clearly, the children
###1169 who moved to an affluent Western nation
###1174 to a more primitive, more developing nation,
###1178 the earlier they move to the newer place, the newer
###1183 residence, the more they adopted the same diseases
###1187 and disorders, including mental diseases,
###1190 of the new adoptive country that they've joined.
###1195 That is a very important observation.
###1198 So, if a child comes to the United States from Ethiopia
###1203 when he or she is only 6 years old,
###1206 they're going to be a lot healthier than the local kids
###1211 because they had 6 years in a primitive environment.
###1216 But if they come here at age 2 or age 1, or worse yet,
###1221 at age 6 months, they develop all the medical, and mental,
###1226 and behavioral conditions that are typically
###1229 in the modern country that they've joined.
###1232 Shouldn't we try to ask ourselves the question,
###1235 why is that the case.
###1236 What are we doing to children that makes them so sick?
###1240 How do we study that when in our country
###1244 all the children are exposed to the same things?
###1247 So, if we asked ourselves, is it because they're
###1249 exposed to too many electromagnetic radiation
###1252 sources?
###1253 Is because they had too many vaccines?
###1257 Is it because they eat genetically modified organisms?
###1260 Is it because of something else?
###1262 Too much stress, perhaps?
###1264 They know when they are 2 years old that one day they
###1267 will work in Google.
###1268 They already are stressed out.
###1272 Who knows.
###1274 We don't have the answers.
###1275 But the only way to find out is to start asking the questions
###1280 and doing some studies.
###1281 For that we need a control group.
###1285 It just so happens that you can create a control group
###1289 in a place that is far away from the United States.
###1292 A place that is so pristine, and so primitive,
###1296 so underdeveloped, that most of the young children
###1301 have not been exposed to what our children have
###1304 been exposed to.
###1306 If we can have a good number of children
###1309 that we could study how healthy they really are,
###1315 how lacking they are in mental and behavioral disorders when
###1318 they go to school, how easy it is to teach them, how excited
###1322 they are to go to school.
###1323 And they are beautifully behaved.
###1325 They always are excited to study, to learn new things.
###1331 When you see those children and you fall in love with them,
###1335 you think, what a great thing we can
###1336 do to impart some of their health to other people
###1341 in developing countries who are suffering
###1344 from all those modern diseases of children that have never
###1346 been a part of our life until just the last few decades.
###1352 Instead of just worrying about it
###1354 and getting more and more hospitals
###1356 to build more and more cancer wings,
###1358 shouldn't we find the causes and treat them
###1362 or avoid them or prevent them.
###1364 Preventive medicine is not so heroic.
###1368 It's exactly the same as preventing
###1372 suffering in children in Nepal because while we create
###1376 the control group of thousands and thousands
###1379 of children that can show us the way, can guide us
###1383 into the light of health and vitality, at the same time,
###1388 we can help them avoid the horrific tragedy of childhood
###1392 trafficking.
###1395 15,000 children, in Nepal alone, are
###1401 used in trafficking, prostitution,
###1403 slavery every year, even now.
###1407 15,000 for a small country.
###1409 That's a huge tragedy.
###1411 
###1414 Some of them are ending up as domestic workers and slaves.
###1418 But most of them end up in India,
###1421 where they're sold for prostitution or slavery
###1426 and it's because their environment is so poor, so
###1431 destitute, that they have no capability of organizing.
###1435 Their communities are fragmented.
###1438 Their families have fallen apart, not just
###1440 because of a 10 year civil war that
###1443 left the country in a desperate state,
###1447 but also because there are no opportunities
###1451 in the rural areas of Nepal.
###1453 No socioeconomic opportunity, no health
###1456 care available, no educational opportunities,
###1459 so the children end up in the fields all the time
###1463 and they are simple and easy to pick.
###1466 And their parents are totally illiterate,
###1469 so it's easy to come to a parent and say we're
###1471 going to take your child and give her
###1473 a great education in India and put her in some boarding school
###1477 where she will learn English and learn a vocation
###1479 and have a great successful life.
###1481 If you are a parent that can't offer anything to your child,
###1484 you'd fall for that.
###1486 And that child ends up trafficked and suffering
###1490 horribly for the rest of her life.
###1494 That can be easily prevented with very little money
###1499 because prevention is 1,000 to 10,000 times more
###1502 effective than heroic salvation after the fact.
###1506 So, instead of the expensive emergency room medicine,
###1510 we're engaging in lifestyle, nutritional, stress reduction
###1516 type of medicine, which prevents the disease
###1519 at a tiny, tiny fraction of the cost.
###1522 As I said, it's not heroic, it's not so attractive and sexy,
###1528 because you can't pinpoint those children
###1530 that you've saved from trafficking.
###1531 
###1534 But you make a real impact, especially
###1536 if you go through those societies,
###1540 in those remote areas, and you help them organize
###1543 and then you make them participate,
###1545 so it is more sustainable.
###1547 And you help rebuild their communities
###1549 and build for them a community center that
###1551 could take care of their health and hygiene.
###1554 And start doing adult literacy program
###1557 that teach the parents some skills
###1558 and how to read and write.
###1560 And organize the women in mother's groups
###1562 because the mother is really the beginning and end of the family
###1567 caretaker, the educator.
###1570 Take care of those in a sustainable way
###1573 and you don't need much money.
###1575 For only 8 and 1/2 dollars a month per child,
###1582 I can, by myself, sustain 5,000 children
###1586 with Everest Learning Academy-- which I really
###1589 want to applaud Google because Google now
###1592 has its own matching program, so people could contribute money
###1596 to the Ecopolitan Eco-Health Community, which
###1599 supports the Everest Academy.
###1601 And I have some great news-- you're the first group
###1604 to hear about it-- that we are now, finally,
###1608 recognized by the Nepali Social Welfare Council
###1611 as an international NGO, similar to the Peace Corps.
###1617 And we are just a few people, not a government.
###1620 
###1624 So, I invite you to start thinking
###1628 about things bigger than yourself.
###1630 That might be the thinking person's stress relief.
###1635 Start thinking about what you can do to make life better
###1639 on earth, not just for yourself, but for others.
###1642 When you do that, suddenly the stress
###1644 will melt way because now you have a vision
###1647 and you have a purpose.
###1649 Think about it.
###1651 They've done studies with people who are stressed,
###1654 and they said, yes, stress will kill you.
###1657 But for some reason, some people have the highest stress level
###1661 and they live the longest.
###1663 Studies have shown that.
###1664 It's a Paradox.
###1666 So, you have to start looking, who are those people
###1669 because we want to be like them, right?
###1672 And we find out that those who live the longest,
###1675 despite severe stress, are the ones who
###1679 are in charge of their own destiny.
###1682 The ones who are not pushed to a nine to five job,
###1686 but feel like they create their own reality.
###1690 They manifest their own dreams, visions, and missions.
###1695 Does it mean that the only people who are the bosses
###1697 can live long?
###1699 Not necessarily.
###1700 Even people who work a 9 to 5 job
###1703 can create a purpose for themselves.
###1706 Can become the heroes of their community
###1708 and of remote countries.
###1711 Can venture into new lands where they can do some good.
###1717 And while doing that, they think every day,
###1721 what am I doing today that meets or gets me
###1724 a step closer to that purpose?
###1727 How do I make earth a better place
###1729 from me, and for my children, and for my friends' children
###1732 and great grandchildren?
###1734 How do we make this a better place?
###1736 If you take a purpose to your heart and start implementing,
###1740 on a daily basis, whatever it is,
###1744 it will simply overshadow the stress
###1748 of trying to simply preserve your own ego in a society that
###1753 expects so much of you.
###1754 Where your responsibility that you adopt
###1757 are so numerous just because you need
###1760 to have affirmation and acceptance
###1764 from your peers and your family members.
###1767 Do something that's outside of yourself and people
###1770 will leave you alone and they will not expect much of you
###1773 because you'll be doing something good.
###1776 Not just for yourself, not just for your own pocket.
###1779 People who just work for money have a lot of stress
###1784 because they always worry, will they have enough money
###1787 to meet their next consumerism goal.
###1791 What are they going to buy next that they won't to use.
###1794 That will rot in their garage-- three car
###1797 garage, which has four cars in it.
###1803 What are those people going to do?
###1805 Nothing.
###1806 They just have to keep showing off to other people
###1809 how much they have.
###1811 So, instead you have various options.
###1814 You can contribute to worthwhile causes--
###1816 we're going to match you.
###1818 You work here-- or you could decide to join.
###1822 You can start getting into the activism mode.
###1826 We already have 5,000 children in our network
###1828 of 65 projects of schools, and childcare centers,
###1832 and orphanages, and community care centers
###1835 and we're growing rapidly.
###1838 We need somebody to be creative and think and help
###1842 us create a technological system that will allow us to collect
###1846 all the data we need to collect about the health of all
###1850 the children in our network.
###1851 My goal is to get to 100,000 children.
###1855 If you participate, as creative individuals, and help us
###1861 find a system, a method, that allows
###1864 us to collect all the information that we need
###1868 to truly tabulate the mental, emotional, social, and physical
###1875 health of our thousands and thousands of children.
###1880 That would help us take better care of our children in Nepal,
###1884 but it will also help us create the data
###1887 that will allow us to start implementing some changes that
###1891 are necessary so that the hospitals will stop building
###1895 those cancer wings for children, so that the pediatrician will
###1898 not have to treat so many children with drugs,
###1902 so the children will not be diagnosed with autism
###1905 and have to take various drugs for ADD and ADHD.
###1911 That's not necessary.
###1912 We just need to understand why is it
###1914 that 100,000 children-- God willing,
###1918 if we get 200,000 children with the support of populations
###1923 that care, that have the ability to care,
###1928 then we can really help the whole world
###1929 because the modern civilization is
###1932 where we have more problems than we have over there.
###1936 As soon as they're organized, as soon
###1937 they can take care of themselves,
###1939 as soon as they have schools and child care centers so that they
###1943 can get to work, as soon as they learn to read and write.
###1946 We give them the opportunity to acquire
###1949 a skill that will make their life in rural Nepal
###1952 a lot better, a lot easier.
###1954 We can preserve their culture, their ethnicity.
###1958 And you're welcome to visit.
###1960 You can come and check with us.
###1962 In March, we have some people from Google
###1964 coming to represent Google.
###1967 And we will have other people coming in October.
###1971 We do it twice a year.
###1972 You can come and join our treks and see for yourself
###1975 what we do with the children.
###1976 You can volunteer or you could just do it from your own home.
###1981 Help us create a system.
###1982 Let's design something that allows technology
###1986 to collect the information we need
###1988 to make this earth a better place.
###1991 And In the meantime, we just need to support it financially.
###1996 Financially we do the support through the skin clinics,
###2000 which is something that I created many, many years ago.
###2004 A way to eliminate and prevent skin cancer, which
###2008 is the most common cancer there is.
###2011 It is so easy to prevent melanomas,
###2013 which kills tens of thousands of Americans every year.
###2016 So easy, you just have to eliminate the lesions that
###2021 might become cancer five years from now or 10 years from now.
###2025 It's true prevention.
###2027 If you have 100 lesions on your body-- little dark spots, flat,
###2033 where the sun won't shine-- be aware.
###2037 Melanoma, the lethal skin cancer everybody is afraid of,
###2041 always always develops in the places
###2044 that have not been exposed to the sun.
###2048 Surprising.
###2050 But it's not surprising, we've known it for many years.
###2053 The information you're getting from the establishment
###2056 is not accurate.
###2058 You have to open the textbook yourself
###2060 and find out where those melanomas occur.
###2063 And you'll be surprised that they
###2065 occur on the scalp under the hair,
###2067 behind your neck where there's no sun exposure,
###2069 on your torso, and your armpits, under your bikini line,
###2073 in the white spots that have never seen the sun.
###2077 You better start mooning the sun,
###2080 so the sun will shine where it normally doesn't shine.
###2085 Get some sun exposure in the various places,
###2087 but you have to do it regularly.
###2090 Because if you don't, those white areas
###2093 that are irregularly exposed once every six months,
###2097 that's where you will develop your melanomas
###2100 and they start from little dark spots that can gradually grow.
###2104 Catch all of those dark spots.
###2105 Eliminate them now.
###2107 It's so easy.
###2109 No surgery necessary.
###2111 No medical treatment necessary.
###2113 You can get rid of a hundred of them in just one sitting.
###2117 And by doing that-- with any of the doctors
###2120 that I have trained, in various places in the world,
###2124 to do this using my method-- by removing those skin lesions,
###2129 you prevent yourself from developing skin cancer.
###2132 Also, the carcinomas are very easy to treat--
###2134 that's a different type of skin cancer.
###2136 Very easy to work with those type of skin lesion
###2140 and catch them early.
###2143 Very good to remove protrusions and growths,
###2146 which could develop as a result of hormonal imbalance
###2150 or the result of unhealthy nutrition.
###2154 And remember, if you get sick because of unhealthy nutrition
###2157 or lack of sleep or other types of exposures
###2161 or toxic exposures, the stress that you have in your life
###2164 becomes far worse.
###2166 It's makes every disease magnified.
###2169 So, you do want to eat really well according to nature.
###2174 If you want to know what I mean by nature,
###2177 go to the website thetruthaboutyourfood.com
###2182 where I give 12 hours of free information.
###2185 12 hours of lectures that you get
###2187 for free-- thetruthaboutyourfood.com.
###2190 Then, you'll learn about healthy nutrition according to nature
###2194 and according to science.
###2197 You do that, you reduce your skin aging.
###2200 
###2202 You make sure that you have all the nutrients necessary,
###2206 like sulfur, which is a crucial nutrient for the skin health
###2210 and for your hair health.
###2212 When you have not sufficient sulfur in your body,
###2214 your hair starts falling and becomes fragile and brittle.
###2219 And your skin starts aging because it
###2220 loses its cytoskeletal structure, that's
###2225 supported and makes it plump and gives it
###2229 a body-- just like when you were born
###2232 and had a plump face and plump skin everywhere.
###2236 You want to retain that, you have to eat really
###2241 food rich, rich, rich, in antioxidants.
###2244 Every meal should be rich in antioxidants
###2247 because today you're exposed to so many toxins
###2250 that they increase the [INAUDIBLE] damage.
###2253 It's not just the sun that we blame on aging.
###2256 The sun is one source of [INAUDIBLE] in our skin,
###2259 but our diet is another big source.
###2262 Whenever you eat rancid fats, you
###2264 damage your subcutaneous fat under the skin,
###2268 and your skin ages prematurely.
###2272 If you want to remove protrusion and growths
###2275 that occur as a result of your diet
###2278 or if you want to improve the hormonal balance,
###2281 so that you don't develop tons and tons of skin tags
###2284 on your neck and under your breast
###2285 and on your face, which you see a lot of people suffering from.
###2291 And if you don't want to have a rough spots and dark areas that
###2297 are caused by excessive free radicals,
###2300 you have to make changes.
###2301 And then your body will be able to handle stress a lot more.
###2305 You can take some adaptogenic herbs,
###2309 which also help you handle stress more effectively.
###2312 But again, they're not addressing
###2314 the underlying problem.
###2316 So, I truly recommend to go back to nature,
###2321 to learn from nature, to come to the Himalayas
###2325 to see what we're doing out there,
###2328 and get your stress level down just by being in nature
###2332 and by adapting a purposeful life.
###2336 That would make your skin healthier,
###2339 your skin lesions less likely to appear, you can easily
###2343 remove them and reduce the stress of bad image problem
###2346 when you look in the mirror, when
###2347 you have those huge things on your nose.
###2351 They can easily be removed.
###2352 Don't tell me that you were born with it; therefore, it's OK.
###2355 Because if you're born with it, it's
###2357 been on you for a longer amount of time
###2358 and it's been exposed more to the elements.
###2360 It's even more risk.
###2362 And if it's caused by the neurological imbalance that
###2365 makes some of those protrusion occur,
###2368 you can improve your neurological state
###2370 by removing them.
###2372 Improving the balance of your body.
###2373 Your symmetry of information that comes,
###2376 sensory information that comes into your brain.
###2379 There are many reasons to improve the skin appearance.
###2383 Not just your image.
###2386 Your skin is the mirror off your health.
###2388 The integrity of this barrier between the inside of our body
###2392 and the environment outside of us.
###2393 That integrity is crucial and it tells us
###2397 a lot about the integrity of your entire body, which
###2400 is made of barriers.
###2402 The blood brain barrier, the digestive barrier,
###2405 the cellular membrane, as a barrier.
###2407 All of those barriers must be healthy for you to be alive.
###2412 And of course, they have to be healthy in order
###2414 for you to be healthy.
###2416 If the, skin as a barrier, has lost its integrity,
###2420 also other barriers, which share the same type of nutrition,
###2424 are going to lose their integrity,
###2426 and you lose your health on so many levels.
###2430 Keep your integrity of the barriers, of your life,
###2437 of the purpose, of the participation in making
###2443 this world, this earth, a better place, and then,
###2447 your stress level will go down because you
###2449 will learn what's really important in life.
###2452 And you will truly stop sweating the small stuff
###2456 that makes you worried and stressed all the time.
###2460 You can do your work and be happy with the results
###2464 because you know that ultimately there's
###2466 something greater, something bigger,
###2469 that you participate in to leave a much better world
###2473 for future generation so that the legacy that each one of you
###2477 has is a legacy worth having for prosperity for many generations
###2483 into the future.
###2484 Thank you very much.
###2485 AUDIENCE: Are you working with other organizations
###2494 like Soroptimist International and the U.N.
###2496 with the children's issue?
###2498 And, if so, what companies?
###2500 Soroptimist has been around since the 1920s, was founded
###2502 in Oakland by women that weren't allowed into rotary.
###2505 And trafficking of women and girls
###2507 has always been something they've
###2508 worked on both internationally, nationally, and locally.
###2511 They help women and children.
###2513 DR. TEL-OREN: At the moment we are fairly young.
###2518 We've only been around for 3 and 1/2 years.
###2521 And it's been so far sort of a one man show.
###2526 And I have no time, really, to get involved
###2530 with other organizations but I wish I did have that time.
###2533 And I need more people to help me
###2535 make the connection because I'm limited.
###2537 I'm just one person who's seeing patients nonstop and giving
###2542 lectures 250 times a year in several continents.
###2547 I travel all the time, and educate, and teach, and treat
###2552 and write, and travel, and guide treks in Nepal.
###2557 I just don't have the time, or the capability,
###2561 or the knowledge to do this this administrative, important work,
###2568 that is connecting with other organizations that
###2570 are pre-existing.
###2570 AUDIENCE: Well, I'd be happy to connect you [INAUDIBLE].
###2572 DR. TEL-OREN: Thank you.
###2573 Any help is always welcome, as long
###2575 as it doesn't add more stuff on my table.
###2578 So, whoever wants to help, please
###2581 help in a meaningful way that can make things really
###2584 change for the better.
###2585 We have to activate as many people
###2587 as we can to make this work.
###2589 We have a wonderful staff in Nepal
###2592 that made it possible to grow to 5,000 children in just 3
###2595 and 1/2 years.
###2596 It's just unbelievable.
###2597 It's above and beyond my wildest imagination.
###2600 I had no idea that we would become, suddenly,
###2604 an INGO, international NGO, in Nepal.
###2607 We can have our own office of the Ecopolitan community
###2610 from the United States.
###2611 We can have a full-time office now in Nepal,
###2615 which we're going to dedicate this March of 2014
###2620 because of this new honor that has been bestowed upon us.
###2624 So, we are humbled by that, but with a lot of responsibility.
###2629 We always want to be sustainable.
###2631 We don't want to pluck daughters, or girls,
###2633 or children from their society and isolate them just
###2637 to save them.
###2638 We want to save the whole community by organizing it
###2642 sustainably, so that all the girls in the community
###2645 will not be trafficked.
###2646 Instead of just save 20 or 30, put them in the house,
###2649 and they will never go back to their home society
###2652 because they have been isolated from it
###2654 and they don't think it's appropriate for them
###2656 to go back to the village.
###2658 And then, other girls in the village who are less fortunate
###2661 end up trafficked instead.
###2662 Some organizations do that.
###2664 They have great intention, but we
###2666 are trying to change society by organizing the communities
###2670 with their own participation, so they
###2672 can take pride in what they're doing.
###2674 And we need help in that direction, as much as we can.
###2678 What we mostly need right now is money.
###2680 AUDIENCE: I have two part question, actually.
###2684 Number one, is about the trek that you mentioned
###2686 that happens in March and October-- or November,
###2691 I'm not sure.
###2691 I want to learn a little bit more about that.
###2694 And the second question is, being born and raised
###2697 in Kathmandu, I would just like to learn a little bit about how
###2701 you view the stress level, the health quality, and just
###2705 quality of life.
###2706 Meaning, people that are living in rural Nepal versus somebody
###2709 that's living in the city.
###2710 DR. TEL-OREN: Excellent question and I often
###2712 lecture about it when I have more time.
###2715 Differentiating what happens to the children
###2717 who migrate to the city.
###2719 And it's usually the young people
###2721 who are looking for some opportunity who
###2724 go to Kathmandu where all the tourists are so there's
###2726 a little more money, there's more action,
###2728 there are more hospitals, and more educational facilities
###2732 that provide greater opportunity.
###2735 Unfortunately, when they go to the city,
###2737 they also lose their culture.
###2739 Many times the ethnicities, the beautiful Nepali culture,
###2743 gets dissolved into the foreigners, and the pollution,
###2747 and the population overload that occurs in the city.
###2751 And also, their health starts deteriorating.
###2754 They start eating more like the Westerners.
###2757 They want to emulate the Westerners if they can.
###2761 So, they start eating a lot higher on the food chain.
###2766 They start eating a lot less plants and a lot more animals,
###2769 which they could never afford in rural Nepal.
###2773 They start having some of the symptoms
###2775 that I see with Americans.
###2777 A little more belly, a little more diabetes, little more
###2781 skin disorders, they start losing their hair.
###2784 I never see bald people who are truly in rural Nepal,
###2788 but in the city I see a lot of bald people.
###2792 All kinds of changes happen when they
###2794 increase too much their level of protein intake,
###2799 especially from animals sources.
###2801 And I'm not telling people that they have to be vegan.
###2803 Nepalis are never vegan.
###2805 Even if they live in rural Nepal,
###2807 they eat animals once in awhile.
###2809 But very rarely can they afford it.
###2811 They reserve it for special celebrations, special holidays.
###2816 Tihar, Dashain, and other special festivals.
###2820 That's when they do that.
###2823 But as soon as they go to the city and they can afford it,
###2825 they start partaking of the cheap flesh that
###2829 comes from factory farming of the animals.
###2831 And that could never be healthy for them.
###2835 And we see the differences in their health,
###2837 and in their mindset, and their attitude.
###2839 I did some studies with vitamin D level,
###2842 and even though Kathmandu is still the city
###2844 and its polluted and populated, I've
###2848 seen the highest level of vitamin D in Nepal much higher
###2852 than anything I've seen in the United States even in Florida.
###2855 And in Israel, the sunny country of Israel, where 99% of people
###2859 are vitamin D deficient, but in Nepal they
###2863 had a much higher, healthier level of vitamin D
###2866 even though they use umbrellas and there are foggy
###2871 times during the monsoon season, and pollution,
###2875 and they don't like the sun because they want to be whiter.
###2878 They're afraid of becoming darker.
###2880 They want to be more like the foreigners.
###2884 As a result, they don't have that much sun exposure
###2886 but yet they still have much higher level
###2888 of vitamin D, which again is something
###2891 that could be interesting for us to study.
###2893 Why is that?
###2895 Why are they healthier on that level?
###2897 Because vitamin D protects you from 25 types of cancer,
###2901 and diabetes, and obesity, cardiovascular disease.
###2905 And people here are deficient.
###2906 And people here take supplements and they still
###2908 have lower level of vitamin D, then
###2910 Nepalis who don't even know that there's such a thing
###2913 called vitamin D. And they would definitely
###2915 never take supplements because they can't afford them.
###2917 And they don't even know what the test
###2919 is because they can't afford the test.
###2920 So, I had to send their blood from Kathmandu to India
###2925 to test their vitamin D 11 level.
###2927 It doesn't exist it Nepal.
###2928 And they all have vitamin D level far,
###2930 far higher than Americans do in the southernmost states
###2935 of the United States.
###2936 So, this is another thing that needs to be questioned.
###2939 We need to really do some good study using
###2941 this amazing population of kind-hearted people
###2946 who want to always give you everything
###2948 they have to give with a smile, no matter how little they have.
###2953 
###2957 You could study so much from them.
###2959 We inspire them just because we could travel to visit.
###2962 But they can inspire us on so many other levels that
###2965 help us open our heart and our mind
###2968 to truly learn about our world and be
###2971 happy with little consumerism, with little materialism,
###2976 and learn to really enjoy what is meaningful in life.
###2980 So, thank you for that question.
###2982 Did I answer it?
###2983 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###2986 DR. TEL-OREN: The trip.
###2987 It's very simple.
###2989 You go on nepali-children.org or on trek4humanity.com.
###2996 One of those two.
###2999 And you read about it and you send an email
###3002 and then you get information about how to join the treks.
###3006 It's a 15 day trip, during which you learn about Nepal--
###3010 not you, of course, because you know so much about it.
###3013 But most people can learn about Nepal
###3017 as if they were there for four months
###3020 because during those 15 days, I guide you incessantly.
###3025 You'll get tired of my accent.
###3028 You'll say, shut up already, we learned enough for one
###3032 day about Nepal.
###3034 You will learn about health, about nutrition,
###3036 about sustainability, about socioeconomic issues,
###3040 about humanitarian work, and you will also
###3044 learn a lot about Nepal that you can't
###3047 learn in any regular trip that is on the beaten path.
###3051 We go to places where tourists never go .
###3053 We go to communities that are never visited.
###3056 We go to areas in the countryside in the Himalayas
###3058 that have amazing views and you will never see another tourist.
###3063 Plus, we visit, during those 15 days,
###3066 a lot of the communities that the Ecopolitan communities
###3069 service through the Everest Learning Academy.
###3072 You will meet the people.
###3073 We also go to Chitwan National Park.
###3075 Come Some elephant ride in the forest and see some animals
###3079 and get into a nice little resort and go into some temple,
###3084 so you can learn about the culture
###3086 and you learn about the people.
###3088 We also do our Touching the Untouchable program.
###3092 That I started two years ago to help
###3095 break the ancient caste system and the prejudice
###3101 of the caste system.
###3103 Even though the government of Nepal has abolished it,
###3106 in the rural part of the country they still practice the caste
###3109 system, to some extent .
###3110 And we try to break through that by blending
###3113 the different castes together with the tourists,
###3116 with the groups, in a very beautiful ceremony that allows
###3120 us to share with them foods and drink and touch
###3124 them, and massage them, and hug them.
###3128 And it shocks them because they're the untouchables.
###3132 And they are so unexpecting when that happens.
###3138 It's just an amazing thing to see.
###3139 Every time we take new groups so it's
###3142 a fresh new experience with the Touching
###3144 the Untouchable program, which I really hope
###3146 will end this caste prejudice forever
###3149 in practice, as well as in law.
###3153 People who are interested in joining the trek
###3155 can be sponsored by other people on the website
###3160 trek4humanity.com there is this option.
###3164 Just like people do the walkathon, the MS-a-thon,
###3167 and so on, you could come there and you're coming
###3170 is by itself supporting the effort
###3173 because most of the money actually
###3175 goes towards the activities of the Everest Learning Academy.
###3180 And so, people can support you, can sponsor you.
###3184 As many friends as you have can sponsor you with as much
###3186 as they want, and that allows you to come and also
###3190 to contribute more to Nepal and also have the matching program
###3194 work with that.
###3195 So, it's a win-win-win for everybody
###3197 and I really want to thank Google
###3199 for being on that matching program list.
###3201 I have to say that also Apple, and Microsoft, and Oracle,
###3207 and Boeing Corporation are all on our matching program
###3210 for the Ecopolitan Eco-Health Community.
###3214 But Google has a great program and we truly, truly
###3217 thank Google for having that.
###3219 MALE SPEAKER: For the benefit of the audience,
###3221 I think that it will be great to introduce
###3223 about the Himalayan, high sulfur, black salts
###3226 that you bring in.
###3227 DR. TEL-OREN: Thank you, I forgot about it.
###3229 I did mention the sulfur earlier and how important
###3232 it is for the skin health, but I forgot
###3234 to continue on that idea, which is really
###3237 the sulfur-rich, black salt from the Himalayas.
###3241 It's made in Nepal in a factory that I
###3243 built in Kathmandu that, basically,
###3248 has all of it's profits supporting
###3250 the children and the activities of the Everest Learning
###3253 Academy.
###3254 So, when you eat this sulfur-rich salt,
###3257 which tastes like eggs, by the way.
###3259 So you add it to a vegetable and suddenly it tastes
###3261 like an egg salad.
###3263 You add it to a sandwich, it tastes like an egg sandwich.
###3266 You add it to an avocado and you want to melt from pleasure.
###3271 You can add it to anything.
###3273 It's kind of addictive because it's so tasty,
###3276 but the sulfur is extremely healthy
###3277 because it supports your detoxification process,
###3280 called sulfation, and supports the structure of your skin
###3283 and your hair, and nails, and all of those structural organs
###3288 from ligaments, tendons, to cartilage.
###3290 They all require sulfur.
###3292 So, this salt comes from a very clean environment.
###3295 It is exactly nothing more, nothing less,
###3299 than the pulverized black crystals
###3302 of this special salt that comes from the Himalayas.
###3306 And that's another way to support our children
###3309 while supporting your own health.
###3312 That's all it does.
###3313 Support the children and your health.
###3316 MALE SPEAKER: You're welcome to stay around.
###3319 Dr. T will be happy to answer questions if you have.
###3322 And now let's give applause to Dr. T.
###3326 DR. TEL-OREN: Thank you.
