###2 All right, we've got everything.
###5 All I need it is my cooker with the all-stars cookbook.
###6 - So, babe, what do you want to make with it?
###8 Chicken? Fish?
###9 - Everything goes with Shaq 'n cheese.
###11 - I don't know why you want to come in here
###13 and mess up my kitchen.
###14 You haven't made anything from that cookbook
###16 since your mom gave it to you
###17 two years ago for your birthday.
###19 - Mess up your kitchen?
###21 Remember those Charles barkley biscuits?
###23 I put my foot in those.
###24 - But they tasted like you still had your sock on.
###27 - Why you playin'?
###28 - No, come on, all right.
###29 I'll handle the meal,
###31 and you go fill out the paperwork
###32 for Kevin's school trip.
###33 - That hurt. - I'm sorry.
###35 - You had said you liked them biscuits.
###37 - [Giggling]
###40 "Happy Birthday, hubby"?
###47 Nick? Honey?
###49 - Yeah, babe?
###50 - Whatever happened to the gift card
###51 that I got you for your birthday not this year but last?
###54 - Um, I got something for the computer.
###56 - Oh, what'd you get?
###57 - Memory.
###59 - Memory? Where is it?
###60 - It's inside the computer. It's a great gift.
###62 My computer never forgets anything.
###64 - Oh, okay, so you definitely used the gift card.
###66 - Yeah. Why?
###68 - I was thinking about what I was gonna get you
###69 for your next birthday,
###71 and then I realized that you never told me
###73 what I got you for that birthday with the gift card.
###77 - Well, I distinctly remember it.
###79 You got me memory, so remember that.
###82 - Oh, I won't forget.
###85 - Anything else? - No, that's it.
###87 - You sure? - Yeah.
###88 - Okay. - Thanks, honey.
###89 - Okay, baby.
###91 - Ram... Mm-Hmm.
###94 I got your ram.

###111 - all right, so educate me.
###113 Why wouldn't you just tell her you lost it?
###115 - Well, I didn't lose it.
###116 I misplaced it.
###117 It's here somewhere.
###119 - And that's not the same thing?
###121 - Nope, they have two completely different definitions.
###124 - Oh, you mean like "innocent" and "not guilty."
###125 Like, Nelson mandela was innocent.
###127 O.J., not guilty.
###131 Why don't you just go buy another one then?
###133 - 'Cause I already told her I used it.
###135 And if she's asking about it,
###136 that means she's looking for it too.
###137 - Don't worry, dad.
###139 If it's in this house, we'll find it.
###140 - Yeah, me and Kevin are gonna work this place
###142 like basketball wives at a purse sale.
###144 - Oh, now, that is the attitude I am looking for, Troy.
###147 - All right, so what's the plan?
###149 - Okay, Kevin and Troy are gonna take the top floor.
###152 I want you guys to search this house from top to bottom.
###154 Leave no stone unturned.
###163 - We're back.
###164 Hey, dad. Hey, Martin.
###166 - Hey, I thought you guys were going to get something to eat.
###169 - We did. - What happened here?
###171 - Nothing happened here.
###172 Weren't you going upstairs?
###174 - Hmm... Did you lose something?
###178 - No, we were just straightening up a little bit
###180 before you got back.
###182 - Oh, okay,
###183 'cause it was pretty straight before I left.
###187 So what happened between now and then?
###189 - Nothing.
###190 We just thought
###191 we'd straighten up a little bit more.
###193 That's all.
###194 - <i>1,000 ways</i> <i>to love a black man,</i> nice.
###199 Something we need to discuss?
###201 - I was wondering,
###203 if I was a black man,
###205 what it would be like if a woman wanted to love me
###207 a thousand ways.
###208 - Mm, okay.
###209 So you're sure you guys aren't looking for anything?
###212 - No, why would we be looking for something?
###215 - I'm not saying that you are.
###216 I'm just saying, if you were,
###218 I could always call somebody to help you guys,
###221 you know, on my new phone.
###224 - Where'd you get that?
###225 - The electronics store.
###226 I didn't think I was gonna be able to afford it,
###229 but then I found a $300 gift card.
###232 - Where? - In a cookbook.
###234 You know, I thought it was yours,
###236 but you said that you used yours to buy...
###239 What was it again?
###241 - Ram.
###242 - Ram! That's right.
###245 - Okay.
###246 Oh, you're so cute.
###248 Look at you, with that cute little smile.
###250 That's good.
###251 Hand it over.
###252 - Hand what over? - My phone.
###253 - How is this your phone?
###255 - You bought it with my gift card.
###256 - Did he tell you about losing a gift card?
###260 - Hey, look at this.
###261 The 436th way to love a black man
###263 is to trim his mustache.
###265 Who'd have thunk it?
###267 - Okay, so, first,
###268 you said that you bought ram with the gift card,
###271 and now you're saying you lost the gift card?
###273 Does this sound right to you, Martin?
###275 - And the 802nd way to love a black man is to...
###279 Oh, wow.
###281 You'd think this would rate higher.
###282 - Okay, look, look, look. You know what?
###284 If this was a court of law,
###286 do you know how crazy you would look right now?
###288 Like, Whoo!
###290 - If this were a court of law,
###292 you wouldn't have a case.
###293 - Oh, really? - Really.
###295 - You know what?
###296 I know you're used to being right all the time,
###298 but this time you're wrong.
###300 - [Laughing]
###315 - This is the plaintiff, Nick Kingston-persons.
###317 He says that his wife, Suzanne, gave him a gift card
###319 for his birthday, and after he misplaced it,
###321 she found it and used it on herself.
###322 He's suing for re appropriation of goods and damages of $300.
###329 - This is the defendant, Suzanne Kingston-persons.
###332 She says the plaintiff lost his gift card
###334 and clearly never planned to use it.
###336 And after she found the gift card in the house,
###338 she asked if he had used his,
###340 and when he said he did,
###341 she saw no problem with using the gift card
###343 that she found on herself.
###345 She has no intention of giving him a dime
###347 and says he needs to stop lying.
###352 - All rise.
###360 Be seated and come to order.
###362 Not that I can make y'all.
###363 It ain't like I got a gun.
###364 - I thought we talked about this.
###366 I’m a deal with this all day long with you now?
###369 Okay, Nick, I see you're suing your wife...
###374 [Chuckles]
###375 Suzanne, for a gift card.
###377 - Yes.
###378 - All right, tell me what's going on.
###379 - She bought me a gift card, and I misplaced it,
###383 and she found it.
###384 - Two years later.
###385 - See, see, in my courtroom, you don't just shout out.
###389 You wait your turn.
###390 You went to public school.
###391 You know, you wait in line for cheese and stuff.
###393 That's what you do here.
###394 - Yes, your honor. My apologies.
###396 - Thank you, your honor.
###397 - Do I need your help?
###400 - I... I was just thanking you.
###401 - Do I look crippled? Do I look like I'm hurt?
###403 Am I leaning to the right?
###405 - No, sir.
###406 - Thank you.
###407 - Okay, well, you know,
###408 my birthday was coming up,
###409 and Suzanne was asking me what I wanted.
###411 And I didn't want to tell her what to get me,
###413 'cause, you know, when you pick out your own birthday present
###416 and that's what you get,
###417 there's no surprise.
###418 - You like surprises, right?
###419 - Yeah, I guess.
###420 - I bet you were surprised
###421 when she spent the money on your gift card, weren't you?
###424 - I bet he was.
###426 - He was surprised.
###427 Like you're surprised you have no gun.
###429 - Can I say something, your honor?
###431 - Yeah, you just said something.
###432 Now, shut up.
###434 You got an issue? We gonna have a problem today?
###437 You need some Xanax?
###439 Go on, now, Nick.
###440 - Well, look, all right, so she got me the card,
###443 and look, I was planning on using it eventually,
###447 but then I put it somewhere and I forgot where I put it.
###450 - He lost it.
###451 - Do you not understand English?
###454 I told you to be quiet.
###455 I'll have you thrown out of here
###456 faster then Mel Gibson should get off that phone.
###458 You understand me?
###460 Be quiet.
###461 - You see what I'm dealing with, your honor?
###463 - I see what you dealing with.
###464 You married it. Don't ask me why.
###465 - Okay, well, I misplaced the card,
###468 and then I couldn't... I forgot where I put it,
###470 and then she found it, and she knew it was my card.
###473 - Oh, you psychic.
###474 - Huh?
###476 - You psychic, right?
###477 That's how you know what people think, right?
###479 Where's her gun?
###483 You don't know, do you?
###485 'Cause you ain't psychic.
###487 So why don't you just tell me what you know
###488 instead of what other people know.
###490 Can we do that?
###491 - Okay, well, she found it,
###493 and I didn't know she found it,
###495 but what she did was ask me if I'd spent mine.
###498 - And what did you say?
###499 - I said I had.
###500 - [Chuckles]
###501 File for the defendant. You win.
###503 - Whoo! - No, no!
###505 [Women screaming]
###506 - Ha-ha! I'm playing!
###508 I'm playing, I'm playing!
###509 You think you're gonna win?
###510 You're out your mind.
###512 You can't shut up.
###514 You see that? She was all excited.
###516 - You play too much.
###517 - "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
###518 High five! High five!"
###520 Don't be high-fiving people up in here.
###522 So why'd you tell her that you spent the card if you didn't?
###525 - Well, I didn't want to hurt her feelings
###527 and have her think I didn't care about her gift.
###530 - You got any witnesses?
###531 - Yes, your honor.
###532 I'd like to call my mother, miss Marilyn persons.
###536 - Okay.
###537 - Thank you, baby.
###539 - How are you, Mrs. persons?
###540 Tell us what you know.
###542 - I will, your honor.
###543 I know she crazy.
###544 I know I'm not gonna sit up here
###546 and let her talk about my son any kind of way,
###548 because she's lucky to have him.
###550 - I agree with you, but I'm asking you about the card.
###552 What do you know about the gift card?
###554 - I don't know anything about that.
###555 But I don't see what the big deal is anyway.
###557 It's a gift card.
###558 All you got to do is go to the store,
###560 get another one for her birthday,
###561 steal it back, and then spend it all on yourself.
###563 She how she likes that.
###566 [Pounding]
###567 - You go ahead and sit down.
###569 I'm scared to ask this question,
###571 but do you have any evidence?
###573 - Yes, I do, your honor.
###574 This is the box the phone came in
###576 and my birthday card.
###578 - [Laughing] He got a box.
###580 - That the phone came in.
###581 - The phone came in.
###583 I asked you if you had evidence.
###585 See, evidence is something like, you know,
###586 I got a smoking gun, I got a knife,
###588 I got some gloves.
###589 They don't fit, we can't acquit.
###590 It's like a girl tied up in the trunk of your car
###592 with some duct tape over her mouth.
###594 That's evidence, but this ain't evidence.
###596 This is not evidence, man.
###597 You know, if you're just gonna waste my time
###599 by bringing something that ain't gonna help your case,
###601 'cause this don't help your case,
###603 you might as well have brought something that makes me happy,
###605 like some cake... did you have cake for your birthday?
###607 - Yes, I did.
###609 - I'm glad you got something, 'cause you didn't get no phone.
###611 What kind of cake did you get for your birthday?
###613 - Sweet potato pound cake.
###614 - What'd he say?
###615 - Sweet potato pound cake.
###616 - What kind of cake do the judge like?
###618 - Sweet potato pound cake.
###619 - Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
###621 Who made this sweet potato pound cake?
###623 - My wife.
###624 - She got the recipe from me, your honor.
###627 - Oh, I see.
###628 We're gonna take a short recess while I get this recipe.
###630 - Hey, man.
###632 - Miss persons, will you meet me in the chambers, please?
###634 - I will do that, your honor.
###635 - Talk about this recipe.
###636 - Are you serious?
###638 - I said don't say nothing else!
###641 I'll be with your mama.
###642 - Hey, hey, hey.
###649 - Your mama crazy.
###652 And she's a wonderful person.
###653 - That's my mother, and you don't know my mother.
###655 - I know her now.
###657 Ha-ha! Bam.
###659 - What? - Boo-yah!
###660 - Hey! - Hey, Judy.
###661 - You did it.
###662 - Let's get this thing started, Judy.
###663 - Court is now back in session.
###665 - Mrs. Kingston-persons,
###666 I know you've been waiting to talk.
###668 Now it's your time, so talk and tell us your story.
###670 - Your honor, I'd like to start by saying
###672 that birthdays are very important to me,
###675 and obviously because it's my husband,
###677 it's a top priority.
###678 - That's enough.
###680 Ha-ha, I'm playing. I'm playing.
###682 I'm playing; I had a little bit to drink in the back.
###685 Go ahead. My bad.
###686 - Whenever I give something to someone,
###688 I want to make sure it's something
###689 that they're really gonna enjoy.
###691 - Oh, I see, and if they don't enjoy it,
###692 you just, what, take it back from them?
###696 - No, your honor.
###697 I wanted this gift to be different,
###698 because the first three attempts weren't great.
###701 - What was your first attempt?
###703 - I got him a box set of prince songs.
###705 - No, you didn't. Prince?
###707 Girl, I didn't think you like... look at you.
###711 Who loves prince?
###712 - The judge loves prince.
###714 - Hold up. You don't like prince?
###716 - Can I...
###717 - You don't like prince?
###719 You don't like prince? - I like prince.
###720 - We can shut this down now.
###721 You don't like the purple wonder?
###723 - I had it already.
###724 - You didn't tell her that, did you?
###726 - Yes, he did.
###727 - You got a cd player in your house?
###729 - Yeah, I got a cd player.
###730 - You got a cd player in your car?
###731 - Yeah.
###732 - Judy, what should he have done?
###733 - Should have just listened to the prince in your car.
###736 - There you go.
###737 But you just trying to be honest, right?
###738 That's why you couldn't do that.
###739 - If I am not honest with this woman,
###741 what else can it lead to, man?
###743 - Okay, man, I'm not saying you got to lie to your wife.
###745 You should never lie to your wife,
###747 'cause they'll find out anyway,
###748 'cause they got stuff in your computer.
###749 They can find out where you've been.
###751 Trust me on that one.
###752 I'm saying sometimes you can fool your wife.
###754 - Wait, wait, wait. What's the difference?
###755 - Yes, your honor, I'd like to know too.
###757 - I would tell you, but you know what,
###758 my wife watches the show.
###759 What's up, baby?
###760 You see what they tried to do, Judy?
###762 - Yeah. - What they try to do?
###763 Trying to make a fool of me, but who's not a fool?
###766 - You not a fool.
###767 - That's right. I ain't no fool.
###768 That's why I didn't fall for that.
###769 I'm too quick. You see that?
###771 You didn't see me move, did you?
###774 Go ahead.
###775 What else you get this man?
###776 - Madden 2008.
###778 - He mad about that?
###779 What's wrong with madden 2008.
###781 - It was 2009, your honor.
###783 - Well, what's the difference?
###784 - What's the difference?
###785 They change the game every year.
###787 That's why they make 2008, 2009.
###789 - No, they don't.
###790 They put a different dude on the box.
###791 I got the game I've got the game!
###793 I got 2008 and 2009.
###795 Ain't no difference, just the box!
###797 That's how they get $45 from you.
###799 Your wife was saving money.
###800 - Your honor, after all of that,
###802 I finally just relented and got a gift card,
###805 because I figured that way he could pick something out
###807 that he really wanted,
###809 and he would be happy and I would be happy.
###811 - Can I say something? - Oh!
###813 I can't look at you. Is he still here, Judy?
###816 - I think he is, sir. - Is he trying to talk to me?
###818 - He's trying to talk to you. - Have I told him to shut up?
###820 I still hear voices.
###821 - Your honor... - I still hear voices.
###822 - Can I... - I still hear voices.
###824 - Can I say something?
###825 - I hear voices!
###829 These folks don't learn nothing.
###831 Go ahead.
###832 - Well, your honor,
###833 I would like to now present my witnesses.
###835 - Oh, you got witnesses? - Yes, sir.
###837 - Oh, this is gonna be fun.
###839 Go ahead. Bring your first witness.
###840 - My first witness is my son Kevin.
###846 - Is this your first time in court?
###847 - Yes, your honor.
###849 - It's a shame that your first time in court is here
###851 'cause your mother and father are fighting
###852 about some kind of gift card,
###853 when as a young black man,
###855 you have plenty of opportunities to be in court.
###857 You could be picked up for assault, battery,
###859 driving drunk, driving while black,
###861 taking a white woman across state lines.
###864 You have plenty of opportunities to come to this courtroom,
###866 and this is a wasted opportunity for you,
###868 and I want to apologize.
###869 - I'd rather not go to court.
###870 - Oh, you're gonna go. You're black.
###872 You're gonna go. It's gonna happen.
###873 So, Kevin, what do you know about this case?
###875 - My dad asked me and my friend Troy
###877 to help look for the gift card.
###878 - Is this Troy in the courtroom now?
###880 - Yes.
###881 - Step up to the mic, please.
###883 Are you Troy?
###884 - I am he, your honor.
###888 - [Laughs]
###889 - It is he, your honor. - He is he.
###890 Would you like to state your last name?
###891 - Not particularly.
###893 I don't see how that's relevant to the proceedings hereforth.
###897 - Oh, hereforth. - Hereforth.
###899 - That's a big word for a little man.
###901 - All I'm saying, your honor, is that I am simply here
###903 as a moral and fiduciary accoutrement
###905 to Mr. Kingston-persons.
###907 My name is irrelevant.
###908 What's relevant is that I've taken a stand.
###911 - What's relevant is, drug usage is destroying
###913 young people across America.
###916 And, Kevin, if you want to continue
###918 to grow up and be a good man,
###919 you got to let some friends go.
###921 Troy, you sit your little butt down.
###923 And we're gonna get you some help.
###924 We're gonna have people come in from child services
###926 to find out what your problem is.
###928 - Is this the best you got?
###929 Your mama and a little white boy?
###932 Kevin, you got anything else to add to this?
###934 - Um, yes, your honor.
###936 My father told me, whatever you do,
###938 do not tell your mother what we're looking for.
###941 - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - See?
###943 - Hey! Hey!
###946 Asking a child to lie?
###947 - Telling him not to say anything is not a lie.
###951 - Thank you. Thank you.
###953 That's all.
###954 Young man, you can step down.
###957 Do you have anymore witnesses?
###960 - I'd like to call my daughter Lindsey.
###964 - So what do you know about this case?
###966 - Not much, sir.
###967 All I know is, is that I was not exactly there
###969 when they were looking for the gift card,
###971 but when I returned home my bedroom was a complete mess.
###974 - Now, how was your bedroom before you left?
###976 - Um, it was a mess.
###978 - Then you can just sit down.
###980 Anymore witnesses?
###982 - I'd like to call
###983 Nick's best friend Martin to the stand.
###985 - Oh, no. No, you didn't.
###987 - Now you're gonna sit here...
###989 - No, you did not!
###990 No, you did not bring your best friend...
###992 Young man, young man, young man, young man.
###995 Obviously you're not married, right?
###996 - I am...
###997 - So you don't know the rules of marriage.
###999 - This is true. - This man needs you.
###1001 And you're on her side.
###1003 - I wouldn't say I'm on her side.
###1005 - Just say the truth! Just tell me the truth!
###1007 - I can't handle the truth!
###1010 - I know what's going on here, Judy.
###1012 - What's going on?
###1013 - If you're feeling the stress from Nick's wife,
###1016 blink twice.
###1021 You are excused.
###1023 - I'd like to speak, your honor.
###1024 - Who the hell are you?
###1026 - I am Suzanne's assistant
###1028 and real best supportive friend Gigi.
###1031 - You're her best friend, Gigi? - Yes.
###1033 - Then I'd like you to go over to Nick's side
###1034 so you can see what that feels like,
###1036 to have a friend be a traitor.
###1037 Please go to that side.
###1038 - [Laughing] Yeah, come on over.
###1041 - And I'd like to say, no matter where I'm standing,
###1043 the truth will prevail.
###1045 - Something will.
###1046 So, Gigi, what do you know about this?
###1049 - Well, I purchased the gift card.
###1051 - Oh, you purchased the gift card?
###1053 - Yes, your honor.
###1054 - She's my assistant, your honor,
###1056 so I asked her to go pick it up.
###1058 - Uh-uh, you asked her to speak; Let her speak.
###1060 - Well, I can tell you that Suzanne was very excited
###1062 about getting Nick this gift card,
###1063 'cause she wanted him to have something he really wanted.
###1066 When I asked, "what did he get with the gift card?"
###1068 She said he didn't buy anything.
###1070 - When was this?
###1071 - About a week after his birthday.
###1072 But then I didn't hear anything else about it
###1074 until she came to work the other day
###1076 and said he had lied to her
###1077 and said he had bought something with the card, but he didn't,
###1079 because he lost it, and she found it,
###1081 and I told her she ought to get herself something
###1083 to get through the pain of being lied to,
###1085 and she got herself a phone.
###1087 - That's how it happened!
###1090 - Hey! Hey!
###1091 Hey! Everybody shut up!
###1093 Everybody shut up!
###1096 I've had about enough.
###1097 I will throw every last one of you out this courtroom.
###1099 I swear to God.
###1101 - It would not have gotten to this point if I'd had a gun.
###1103 - Well, you know what? You got one now.
###1105 [People shouting]
###1106 I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what.
###1108 I'll tell you what.
###1109 Y'all come in this court, you're gonna have some respect,
###1111 even if this is just a tv show and this ain't real
###1113 and she ain't a bailiff and I ain't a judge!
###1115 We're gonna act like it is!
###1117 - Is this a real gun? - That's a real gun.
###1119 I'm going back to make my decision.
###1126 This case wore me out.
###1127 I mean, for y'all to be coming here
###1128 arguing about a gift card...
###1129 - It's the principle.
###1131 - Well, I hope you like sleeping with the principal,
###1133 'cause you're gonna be sleeping with her for a long time.
###1135 Just because your man's crazy don't mean he's wrong.
###1137 Now, from listening to all the testimony
###1139 of the witnesses,
###1140 even though he lied about what he did with the card,
###1143 I don't think he ever planned
###1144 to relinquish possession of the card.
###1146 It was a gift card.
###1147 Even though you don't like what he did with it,
###1149 it was his present.
###1150 It was his card,
###1151 and you don't have a right to take it back.
###1153 Do you understand me?
###1154 I have to judge in favor of the plaintiff
###1156 for $300.
###1157 - Yes! Ha ha ha!
###1159 I want my money!
###1160 Look, what is it now?
###1162 It's coming. It's coming.
###1163 Boop! It's on your head.
###1165 - Go ahead, laugh it up. Have your fun.
###1167 I will pay you back.
###1168 A dollar a year for the next 300 years.
###1171 - Remember that if you break up and you have to pay alimony.
###1174 - We are not breaking up, ma.
###1176 - Especially not if she tries number 874.
###1179 - What's number 874?
###1180 - It's pretty much just 873 but with whipped cream.
###1184 - I read that book, and frankly,
###1185 I think it's a waste of whipped cream.
###1188 - Are you guys talking about <i>1,000 ways to love a black man?</i>
###1191 - Yes, why?
###1192 - My mom has that book.
###1194 - Okay, Kevin, can you take Troy to your room?
###1198 And Lindsey, go clean your room. It's a mess.
###1201 - Okay, mom.
###1203 - Suzanne, I'm sorry that I ruined your case.
###1206 - Oh, there's no need to apologize.
###1208 You were just telling the truth.
###1210 I can't hold that against you.
###1211 - Thank you. - You're welcome.
###1213 - Now, is this what married couples do?
###1215 Fight over everything?
###1216 - No. - Yes.
###1217 - See, this is why I'm never getting married.
###1219 I can't pretend to put somebody else's needs
###1221 above my own,
###1222 which is number 974.
###1226 - Nick, I am sorry.
###1229 - Oh, it's okay, baby.
###1230 You can always buy me another present.
###1232 - Well, I'm not getting you another gift card.
###1234 I know that.
###1235 - It's cool.
###1236 - So what do you want?
###1237 - Um... Does it have to be from a store?
###1241 [People groaning]
###1243 - What?
###1245 - All right, that's our cue to leave.
###1246 Gigi, let's get something to eat.
###1247 - You treating?
###1249 - My treat?
###1250 Don't you owe me 60 bucks?
###1252 - No. - Yes.
###1255 - Prove it.
