1
0:0:6,439 --> 0:0:8,341
It's a marble masterpiece,


2
0:0:8,341 --> 0:0:11,111
one of the most famous buildings
in the world.


3
0:0:11,111 --> 0:0:14,681
The Leaning Tower of Pisa is
simply an impossibility.


4
0:0:14,681 --> 0:0:18,318
More like something you dream
than something that can exist.


5
0:0:18,318 --> 0:0:21,454
For hundreds of years, the world
has watched in amazement


6
0:0:21,454 --> 0:0:25,692
as the building defies gravity
teetering on a razor's edge.


7
0:0:25,692 --> 0:0:29,762
It really is quite miraculous
that it has not fallen over.


8
0:0:29,762 --> 0:0:31,764
And thank goodness it hasn't.


9
0:0:31,764 --> 0:0:34,334
If the Tower were to fall no one
would feel it


10
0:0:34,334 --> 0:0:36,202
more than the people of Pisa.


11
0:0:36,202 --> 0:0:39,339
For them the Tower is the heart
of their city.


12
0:0:39,339 --> 0:0:42,876
It is what draws hundreds
of thousands of tourists every year,


13
0:0:42,876 --> 0:0:52,318
each one anxious to give
a helping hand.


14
0:0:52,318 --> 0:0:56,89
It really needs one. The Leaning
Tower of Pisa can tumble


15
0:0:56,89 --> 0:0:57,891
in an instant.


16
0:0:57,891 --> 0:1:1,194
For 800 years architects and
engineers have been trying to


17
0:1:1,194 --> 0:1:3,396
fiix the Leaning Tower of Pisa.


18
0:1:3,396 --> 0:1:6,132
Nearly every attempt
has been disastrous.


19
0:1:6,132 --> 0:1:14,73
But somehow the Tower
has serenely survived.


20
0:1:14,73 --> 0:1:16,976
Today the Tower is in greater
danger than ever.


21
0:1:16,976 --> 0:1:18,845
It's lean is so extreme


22
0:1:18,845 --> 0:1:29,722
that the Italian government has
closed it to avoid a potential disaster.


23
0:1:29,722 --> 0:1:32,992
It's been more than ten years since
anyone has walked up its marble


24
0:1:32,992 --> 0:1:36,629
stairway which leads to its
stunning bell chamber


25
0:1:36,629 --> 0:1:38,431
until now.


26
0:1:38,431 --> 0:1:41,668
We will take a behind the scenes
look inside the Tower


27
0:1:41,668 --> 0:1:44,47
that's been locked off to the
public for so long


28
0:1:44,47 --> 0:1:50,143
and climb to the top for a rare
view of its breathtaking vistas.


29
0:1:50,143 --> 0:1:53,446
We'll examine the bizarre history
of the 800 year effort to


30
0:1:53,446 --> 0:1:56,916
save the Tower and introduce the
current plan that some believe


31
0:1:56,916 --> 0:2:0,19
just may make the
Tower safe forever,


32
0:2:0,19 --> 0:2:5,158
that is if it doesn't
destroy it first.


33
0:2:5,158 --> 0:2:10,296
Today, the Tower is in crisis
a patient in intensive care.


34
0:2:10,296 --> 0:2:15,1
830 tons of lead have been added to
hold down its north side.


35
0:2:15,1 --> 0:2:17,904
Steel bands cinch its waist.


36
0:2:17,904 --> 0:2:21,341
340-foot long cables are wrapped
around it to prevent


37
0:2:21,341 --> 0:2:23,743
an impending catastrophe,


38
0:2:23,743 --> 0:2:26,446
while a group of international
experts struggle to fiind


39
0:2:26,446 --> 0:2:31,884
a permanent solution.


40
0:2:31,884 --> 0:2:35,188
Michele Jamiolkowski
a geo-technical engineer


41
0:2:35,188 --> 0:2:38,57
is the chairman of the current
team to save the Tower.


42
0:2:38,57 --> 0:2:40,426
This is not an easy task.


43
0:2:40,426 --> 0:2:45,531
Not only me, but all the other
members of the committee


44
0:2:45,531 --> 0:2:49,535
became acquainted with the
responsibility and with the risk


45
0:2:49,535 --> 0:2:54,474
which we are incurring
with this task.


46
0:2:54,474 --> 0:2:58,745
Their goal is to reduce the Tower's
lean by about 16 inches.


47
0:2:58,745 --> 0:3:3,349
This would take the Tower out of
danger, but keep it looking the same.


48
0:3:3,349 --> 0:3:7,153
After all, no one wants a straight
Tower of Pisa.


49
0:3:7,153 --> 0:3:11,424
We never considered straightening
the Tower, because the inclination


50
0:3:11,424 --> 0:3:13,359
is part of its character.


51
0:3:13,359 --> 0:3:17,96
It's absolutely central to Pisa.


52
0:3:17,96 --> 0:3:21,467
So there are two unacceptable
scenarios really, aren't there?


53
0:3:21,467 --> 0:3:24,971
One would be a straight Tower
but the other one would be


54
0:3:24,971 --> 0:3:27,74
one that fell over.


55
0:3:27,74 --> 0:3:31,811
The common perception is that
the Tower is in danger of tipping over.


56
0:3:31,811 --> 0:3:35,782
In fact, that is only one of two
perils that could reduce it to rubble.


57
0:3:35,782 --> 0:3:41,54
One problem is the very well known
continuous increase of inclination,


58
0:3:41,54 --> 0:3:45,58
which was bringing the Tower
to falling over.


59
0:3:45,58 --> 0:3:50,363
And the second problem was the
concern about the structural collapse.


60
0:3:50,363 --> 0:3:54,167
The first problem, the Tower's
increasing slant is due to the soft


61
0:3:54,167 --> 0:3:57,77
soil it is built on.


62
0:3:57,77 --> 0:4:1,874
Professor Carlo Viggiani is a member
of the committee to save the Tower.


63
0:4:1,874 --> 0:4:4,911
He has been studying
the Tower for over 35 years.


64
0:4:4,911 --> 0:4:8,247
The leaning was by change.
Probably because on the south


65
0:4:8,247 --> 0:4:9,782
side of the Tower


66
0:4:9,782 --> 0:4:13,886
the subsoil was weaker
than the north side.


67
0:4:13,886 --> 0:4:18,858
So, and once it started to lean
from that side, then the weight is


68
0:4:18,858 --> 0:4:20,93
going on that side


69
0:4:20,93 --> 0:4:24,697
and the thing is
continuously increasing.


70
0:4:24,697 --> 0:4:28,468
By 1990, the Tower was leaning
at an astounding five


71
0:4:28,468 --> 0:4:29,736
and a half degrees,


72
0:4:29,736 --> 0:4:32,605
or 17 feet off the perpendicular.


73
0:4:32,605 --> 0:4:37,243
It literally defies the laws
of physics.


74
0:4:37,243 --> 0:4:41,514
Committee member John Burland
is a professor of soil mechanics.


75
0:4:41,514 --> 0:4:43,383
I think it's miraculous.


76
0:4:43,383 --> 0:4:45,752
I mean, when we came here in 1990,


77
0:4:45,752 --> 0:4:48,521
we couldn't get it to stand up
on our computer.


78
0:4:48,521 --> 0:4:51,758
It's leaning at 5.5 degrees.
We could only get our computer


79
0:4:51,758 --> 0:4:56,195
Tower to lean at 5.44 degrees
and then it used to fall over.


80
0:4:56,195 --> 0:5:1,701
So it really is quite miraculous
that it has not fallen over.


81
0:5:1,701 --> 0:5:4,37
The Tower isn't just in danger
of falling,


82
0:5:4,37 --> 0:5:7,206
it can collapse under
its own weight.


83
0:5:7,206 --> 0:5:10,376
Part of the problem stems
from its structure.


84
0:5:10,376 --> 0:5:12,378
Although the Tower
appears solid,


85
0:5:12,378 --> 0:5:17,15
it's actually a hollow cylinder
reaching 185 feet into the sky.


86
0:5:17,15 --> 0:5:20,787
Within it, a staircase winds
up to the top.


87
0:5:20,787 --> 0:5:24,957
Most of its 14,000 tons are
supported by its walls.


88
0:5:24,957 --> 0:5:28,127
Its walls, however, aren't
solid either.


89
0:5:28,127 --> 0:5:32,231
They're stone, lime and mortar,
covered with a thin marble facade.


90
0:5:32,231 --> 0:5:36,569
One side with all of the stone is
getting a lot of pressure.


91
0:5:36,569 --> 0:5:40,106
The other side with all of its stone
is not getting that pressure,


92
0:5:40,106 --> 0:5:44,1
so there is an inequality.


93
0:5:44,1 --> 0:5:48,8
As the Tower's lean continues
the pressure intensifies.


94
0:5:48,8 --> 0:5:50,55
Eventually the marble in this
second floor section


95
0:5:50,55 --> 0:6:19,378
will give way the building
will collapse upon itself.


96
0:6:19,378 --> 0:6:23,449
It could explode at any time, or this
was the case in 1990 anyway.


97
0:6:23,449 --> 0:6:26,752
So we've got a Tower that's just
about to fall over and it's


98
0:6:26,752 --> 0:6:28,454
on the point of exploding.


99
0:6:28,454 --> 0:6:31,624
And that makes it probably the
biggest civil engineering


100
0:6:31,624 --> 0:6:34,727
challenge there is.


101
0:6:34,727 --> 0:6:37,163
Solving the challenge of the
Tower has stumped


102
0:6:37,163 --> 0:6:38,898
generations of engineers.


103
0:6:38,898 --> 0:6:43,169
Its problems began almost
as soon as it was built.


104
0:6:43,169 --> 0:6:46,472
When plans for the Tower were
first drawn up in the 12th Century,


105
0:6:46,472 --> 0:6:49,876
a spot was chosen with
a commanding view of Pisa.


106
0:6:49,876 --> 0:6:51,711
It was beautiful.


107
0:6:51,711 --> 0:6:53,88
But not a very good place
to build,


108
0:6:53,88 --> 0:7:0,92
since in ancient Italy
the site had been a lagoon.


109
0:7:0,92 --> 0:7:4,857
Piero Pierotti, is an art historian
and professor of medieval architecture


110
0:7:4,857 --> 0:7:8,694
at the University of Pisa.


111
0:7:8,694 --> 0:7:13,232
Pisa was a system of islands in the
middle of a very wide lagoon.


112
0:7:13,232 --> 0:7:16,802
This lagoon was slowly filled in
by the two most important


113
0:7:16,802 --> 0:7:19,572
Tuscan rivers.
The Arno and the Auser.


114
0:7:19,572 --> 0:7:22,208
And where the rivers had filled in,
they left mud,


115
0:7:22,208 --> 0:7:25,177
which is softer and wet.


116
0:7:25,177 --> 0:7:31,117
The soft wet soil left behind by the
rivers was where the Tower was built.


117
0:7:31,117 --> 0:7:36,455
The ground is so soft that it's
really like building a brick Tower


118
0:7:36,455 --> 0:7:37,857
on a soft carpet.


119
0:7:37,857 --> 0:7:40,66
You can go to a certain height,


120
0:7:40,66 --> 0:7:44,53
and no matter how straight you try
and keep that Tower,


121
0:7:44,53 --> 0:7:47,667
it will start to lean
and then fall over.


122
0:7:47,667 --> 0:7:50,236
Why build a Tower
doomed to lean?


123
0:7:50,236 --> 0:7:53,673
Although the medieval architects
knew that the soil was soft,


124
0:7:53,673 --> 0:7:55,942
they may not have known how soft.


125
0:7:55,942 --> 0:7:59,545
They thought they had found the
perfect spot to build a monument


126
0:7:59,545 --> 0:8:2,81
to the glory of Pisa.


127
0:8:2,81 --> 0:8:6,485
Today, Pisa is a quiet university
town of 100,000.


128
0:8:6,485 --> 0:8:9,589
In the 11 th Century, it was
a powerful city-state.


129
0:8:9,589 --> 0:8:13,426
Its navy roved the seas
conquering other cities.


130
0:8:13,426 --> 0:8:18,898
In 1062, the Pisa navy sailed to
Palermo, the capital of Sicily,


131
0:8:18,898 --> 0:8:23,536
bent on conquest.


132
0:8:23,536 --> 0:8:26,138
When Pisa's fleet arrived in Palermo...


133
0:8:26,138 --> 0:8:29,508
the Sicilians they encountered there
said that the citizens of Pisa


134
0:8:29,508 --> 0:8:33,379
were the meanest and most ignorant
people they had ever met.


135
0:8:33,379 --> 0:8:37,183
In reality, there was this strong
arrogance of considering


136
0:8:37,183 --> 0:8:39,619
themselves the first, the best.


137
0:8:39,619 --> 0:8:46,659
This arrogance made it easy for
other cities to fiind allies against Pisa.


138
0:8:46,659 --> 0:8:50,396
In 1063, the victorious Pisan navy
returned,


139
0:8:50,396 --> 0:8:53,532
their chests bursting with pride
and their pockets bursting


140
0:8:53,532 --> 0:8:56,769
with Sicilian money.


141
0:8:56,769 --> 0:9:0,239
They decided to build a glorious
square, the religious center


142
0:9:0,239 --> 0:9:1,707
of medieval Pisa,


143
0:9:1,707 --> 0:9:5,144
the square known today as the
Piazza dei Miracoli,


144
0:9:5,144 --> 0:9:10,816
Square of Miracles.


145
0:9:10,816 --> 0:9:14,553
It would have a magnificent
cathedral, one that would surpass


146
0:9:14,553 --> 0:9:17,89
any other church in Italy.


147
0:9:17,89 --> 0:9:20,526
Next to it would be a baptistery
where Pisa's richest citizens


148
0:9:20,526 --> 0:9:24,3
could be baptized.


149
0:9:24,3 --> 0:9:25,364
It's crowning glory,


150
0:9:25,364 --> 0:9:29,869
the masterpiece of Pisan civilization
would be the cathedral's bell Tower,


151
0:9:29,869 --> 0:9:33,806
or campanile.


152
0:9:33,806 --> 0:9:38,477
On August Ninth, 1173, the foundation
for the Tower was laid,


153
0:9:38,477 --> 0:9:44,116
directed it is thought, by Pisan
architect, Bonnano Pisano.


154
0:9:44,116 --> 0:9:47,253
By the time the third level was built
the Tower was starting to


155
0:9:47,253 --> 0:9:48,587
settle unevenly.


156
0:9:48,587 --> 0:9:52,858
It was leaning north
not south as it does today.


157
0:9:52,858 --> 0:9:54,593
The Italians weren't worried.


158
0:9:54,593 --> 0:9:57,296
Many buildings in Pisa
leaned a little.


159
0:9:57,296 --> 0:9:58,964
They simply compensated


160
0:9:58,964 --> 0:10:1,801
by making the columns and arches on
the north side of the third


161
0:10:1,801 --> 0:10:5,571
level a little taller.


162
0:10:5,571 --> 0:10:8,274
Pisa had something
like 10,000 towers.


163
0:10:8,274 --> 0:10:11,577
It was known that an adjustment
of the ground was necessary.


164
0:10:11,577 --> 0:10:14,13
They would start construction and
they would look onto


165
0:10:14,13 --> 0:10:16,82
which side the Tower was leaning


166
0:10:16,82 --> 0:10:18,384
and would build up the other side.


167
0:10:18,384 --> 0:10:21,22
They didn't have the technology
which we have now.


168
0:10:21,22 --> 0:10:23,222
If we were doing the Tower now
we would have driven


169
0:10:23,222 --> 0:10:25,124
what are called piles


170
0:10:25,124 --> 0:10:29,228
down onto that dense
sand 40 meters down.


171
0:10:29,228 --> 0:10:32,398
But they didn't have
that technology in 1173.


172
0:10:32,398 --> 0:10:37,803
They just learnt that you could
build towers to a certain height


173
0:10:37,803 --> 0:10:41,34
from years and centuries
of experience.


174
0:10:41,34 --> 0:10:43,375
But what they had learned
from experience,


175
0:10:43,375 --> 0:10:45,511
did not hold true for this Tower.


176
0:10:45,511 --> 0:10:48,748
The soil here was softer and the
Tower would have fallen


177
0:10:48,748 --> 0:10:50,683
if they continued building.


178
0:10:50,683 --> 0:10:52,51
But they didn't.


179
0:10:52,51 --> 0:10:55,221
In 1178, construction stopped.


180
0:10:55,221 --> 0:10:58,858
Some historians say it was because
the Tower was tilting too much.


181
0:10:58,858 --> 0:11:2,895
Others say it was political and
military troubles in Pisa.


182
0:11:2,895 --> 0:11:7,299
Whatever the reason, the delay
lasted 100 years.


183
0:11:7,299 --> 0:11:11,403
The Tower survived only because
the interruption allowed


184
0:11:11,403 --> 0:11:14,6
the soil beneath the Tower


185
0:11:14,6 --> 0:11:18,944
to settle to include the resistance
and to support the fiinal


186
0:11:18,944 --> 0:11:20,713
lot of the Tower.


187
0:11:20,713 --> 0:11:24,35
When work resumed in the 13th Century
the Tower was leaning


188
0:11:24,35 --> 0:11:28,554
about seven inches to the north.
As building continued upwards,


189
0:11:28,554 --> 0:11:31,791
the Tower began to tilt
in the opposite direction.


190
0:11:31,791 --> 0:11:35,294
This time, the masons tried to
correct the tilt by making the stones


191
0:11:35,294 --> 0:11:37,997
on the south side taller.


192
0:11:37,997 --> 0:11:43,569
They corrected the shape just to
bring the Tower in a vertical position


193
0:11:43,569 --> 0:11:47,106
so that the Tower is
not actually straight.


194
0:11:47,106 --> 0:11:51,677
It is like a banana.
It is shaped in this way.


195
0:11:51,677 --> 0:11:56,415
In 1278, work on the Tower stopped
just short of the fiinal floor.


196
0:11:56,415 --> 0:12:0,653
82 years passed before architect
Tomasso Andrea di Pisa came


197
0:12:0,653 --> 0:12:3,222
on to build the bell chamber.


198
0:12:3,222 --> 0:12:7,76
By 1370, the Tower was complete
and the original vision of the great


199
0:12:7,76 --> 0:12:9,929
square with its Tower was realized.


200
0:12:9,929 --> 0:12:12,565
But as soon as the Tower reached
its full height,


201
0:12:12,565 --> 0:12:14,733
the lean started to accelerate.


202
0:12:14,733 --> 0:12:18,571
They didn't realize that by putting
the little bell chamber on top


203
0:12:18,571 --> 0:12:21,574
it was really going to start moving.


204
0:12:21,574 --> 0:12:24,977
They didn't have that
understanding at that time.


205
0:12:24,977 --> 0:12:30,749
It was thought at the time that the
bell chamber would stabilize the Tower


206
0:12:30,749 --> 0:12:34,53
The bell chamber is designed to
correct the problem, to balance out


207
0:12:34,53 --> 0:12:37,79
the whole preexisting structure.


208
0:12:37,79 --> 0:12:41,193
The 14th Century solution was to
build a different number of steps


209
0:12:41,193 --> 0:12:43,762
on each side of the bell chamber.


210
0:12:43,762 --> 0:12:46,165
On the north side were four steps,


211
0:12:46,165 --> 0:12:48,2
on the south, six.


212
0:12:48,2 --> 0:12:54,473
In total, the south side ended up
being 34 inches higher than the north.


213
0:12:54,473 --> 0:12:59,44
To further balance the weight larger
bells were placed on the north side.


214
0:12:59,44 --> 0:13:16,729
Finally, Pisa's cathedral had its
Tower, and the Tower had its voice.


215
0:13:16,729 --> 0:13:20,399
Next to the entrance to the Tower
masons sculpted a relief of two ships


216
0:13:20,399 --> 0:13:23,235
entering the Pisan port, as
a tribute to Pisa's


217
0:13:23,235 --> 0:13:24,937
mighty marine power.


218
0:13:24,937 --> 0:13:30,276
Unfortunately by this time, Pisa's
marine power wasn't very mighty.


219
0:13:30,276 --> 0:13:33,646
The Tower conceived as symbol of
Pisa's grandeur,


220
0:13:33,646 --> 0:13:38,817
was now, a crooked testament to the
city's faded dreams.


221
0:13:38,817 --> 0:13:42,688
I am sure that many explained to you
in a precise, technical way


222
0:13:42,688 --> 0:13:44,523
why the Tower is leaning.


223
0:13:44,523 --> 0:13:48,761
But if we wanted to joke, the Tower
could be leaning for another reason.


224
0:13:48,761 --> 0:13:51,964
Its imperfection could be considered
a symbol of the death


225
0:13:51,964 --> 0:13:55,2
that was already inside
the society of Pisa.


226
0:13:55,2 --> 0:13:58,504
The Square was supposed to be
completely paved in marble.


227
0:13:58,504 --> 0:14:1,573
It was never paved
the grass is still here.


228
0:14:1,573 --> 0:14:3,609
It wasn't supposed
to be this way.


229
0:14:3,609 --> 0:14:7,46
And all of this gives the idea
of what was thought that


230
0:14:7,46 --> 0:14:11,85
this city would become
and never became.


231
0:14:11,85 --> 0:14:14,954
The people of Pisa would try for
centuries to straighten


232
0:14:14,954 --> 0:14:31,77
the whole thing out.


233
0:14:31,77 --> 0:14:35,341
>From the moment it was complete
the leaning Tower was crooked


234
0:14:35,341 --> 0:14:37,71
and loved by the people of Pisa.


235
0:14:37,71 --> 0:14:43,349
It is one of the miraculous
structures of the Middles Ages.


236
0:14:43,349 --> 0:14:46,251
And especially
since it started to fall,


237
0:14:46,251 --> 0:14:48,921
it gave it a kind of reclame that


238
0:14:48,921 --> 0:14:50,889
normally it might not have.


239
0:14:50,889 --> 0:14:54,727
It quickly became the center
of public life.


240
0:14:54,727 --> 0:14:58,297
Big feasts and celebrations
took place on the Piazza.


241
0:14:58,297 --> 0:15:2,368
Standing on the balconies
every family and even their guests


242
0:15:2,368 --> 0:15:3,869
had a privileged space.


243
0:15:3,869 --> 0:15:6,238
They could come out like they did
from the balconies


244
0:15:6,238 --> 0:15:7,573
of their own palaces.


245
0:15:7,573 --> 0:15:11,91
It was like having a reserved
box for the theater.


246
0:15:11,91 --> 0:15:17,82
In 1590, the Tower even played host
to a little known local scientist,


247
0:15:17,82 --> 0:15:19,885
named Galileo.


248
0:15:19,885 --> 0:15:23,122
Legend has it he conducted his famous
experiments with gravity


249
0:15:23,122 --> 0:15:27,526
from its bell chamber.


250
0:15:27,526 --> 0:15:29,995
While the Tower's lean wasn't
increasing much,


251
0:15:29,995 --> 0:15:32,564
the building was sinking.


252
0:15:32,564 --> 0:15:35,401
By the 19th Century, the Tower was
slumping down


253
0:15:35,401 --> 0:15:37,87
about 10 feet into the ground.


254
0:15:37,87 --> 0:15:40,839
And a part of the first floor was
completely obscured.


255
0:15:40,839 --> 0:15:45,177
And in 1838, an Italian architect
Alessandro Gheradesca,


256
0:15:45,177 --> 0:15:47,78
decided to do something about it.


257
0:15:47,78 --> 0:15:52,251
Alessandro Gheradesca said "Wouldn't
it be a wonderful idea


258
0:15:52,251 --> 0:15:55,687
to dig out around the foundation
so everyone can look in


259
0:15:55,687 --> 0:15:59,792
and see these lovely columns going
down to the base of the Tower?"


260
0:15:59,792 --> 0:16:4,83
So he went in there and dug out this
walkway around the base of the Tower


261
0:16:4,83 --> 0:16:6,832
that's called the catino.


262
0:16:6,832 --> 0:16:9,401
Unknown to Gheradesca, there was
a water table


263
0:16:9,401 --> 0:16:11,136
within yards of the surface.


264
0:16:11,136 --> 0:16:17,42
No sooner had he dug down, than
water came gushing in.


265
0:16:17,42 --> 0:16:21,113
Suddenly, the Tower that had stood
serenely and safely for five centuries,


266
0:16:21,113 --> 0:16:22,781
lost its balance.


267
0:16:22,781 --> 0:16:26,585
It lunged over a foot.


268
0:16:26,585 --> 0:16:29,54
And how it didn't fall over,
we really don't know.


269
0:16:29,54 --> 0:16:31,924
It was another miracle
that it didn't.


270
0:16:31,924 --> 0:16:35,427
The Tower had survived the first
modern attempt to improve it.


271
0:16:35,427 --> 0:16:40,632
And for 70 years, no further
attempts to help it were made.


272
0:16:40,632 --> 0:16:44,77
Then, in 1902, Venice's
St. Marco's Square, a bell


273
0:16:44,77 --> 0:16:47,5
Tower came crashing down.


274
0:16:47,5 --> 0:16:51,11
It had stood more than 1,000 years.


275
0:16:51,11 --> 0:16:55,347
But on the morning of July 14th,
a huge crack snaked up the Tower


276
0:16:55,347 --> 0:16:59,84
and the whole structure collapse
into an 18,000-ton pile of dust


277
0:16:59,84 --> 0:17:3,55
and rubble.


278
0:17:3,55 --> 0:17:8,6
It took some two days that collapse
so there were no people


279
0:17:8,6 --> 0:17:10,95
killed by that.


280
0:17:10,95 --> 0:17:13,665
But it was impossible to stop
that collapse.


281
0:17:13,665 --> 0:17:16,969
Scared by the disaster in Venice
the Italian government


282
0:17:16,969 --> 0:17:19,438
formed a committee to
study Pisa's Tower.


283
0:17:19,438 --> 0:17:22,808
Experts reviewed the leaning Tower's
condition, but nothing was done


284
0:17:22,808 --> 0:17:27,779
to stabilize it.


285
0:17:27,779 --> 0:17:32,317
That is until 1933, when fascist
dictator, Benito Mussolini,


286
0:17:32,317 --> 0:17:37,89
turned his attention to the Tower.


287
0:17:37,89 --> 0:17:40,359
Mussolini was obsessed with returning
Italy to the glory it hasn't


288
0:17:40,359 --> 0:17:42,528
known for several centuries.


289
0:17:42,528 --> 0:17:45,864
It was unthinkable that Italy's
national symbol should be


290
0:17:45,864 --> 0:17:47,799
a tilting Tower.


291
0:17:47,799 --> 0:17:49,868
He had made the trains
run on time,


292
0:17:49,868 --> 0:17:52,571
how difficult would it be to
straighten a Tower?


293
0:17:52,571 --> 0:17:57,209
The idea was to try and inject
cement into the foundation


294
0:17:57,209 --> 0:18:0,479
masonry, not into the ground
but into the masonry.


295
0:18:0,479 --> 0:18:4,683
And the reason being that water
was seeping


296
0:18:4,683 --> 0:18:8,587
up through Gheradesca's catino
up through the masonry


297
0:18:8,587 --> 0:18:12,491
and washing out the mortar.


298
0:18:12,491 --> 0:18:16,295
Mussolini's engineers thought that
excess water under the Tower


299
0:18:16,295 --> 0:18:19,998
was weakening the foundation.
They decided to seal the base of


300
0:18:19,998 --> 0:18:25,737
the Tower with concrete to prevent
water from seeping in from below.


301
0:18:25,737 --> 0:18:30,742
Workers drilled over 361 holes into
the Tower's foundations.


302
0:18:30,742 --> 0:18:35,514
Then they pumped in over 80 tons
of cement.


303
0:18:35,514 --> 0:18:39,51
Once again, the Tower's delicate
balance was shattered


304
0:18:39,51 --> 0:18:43,121
and it lurched southward nearly
three and a half inches.


305
0:18:43,121 --> 0:18:47,459
Now the Tower was in real danger
but there was no time to fiix it.


306
0:18:47,459 --> 0:18:49,561
World War II had started.


307
0:18:49,561 --> 0:18:54,32
American soldiers were hitting the
back door of Hitler's fortress.


308
0:18:54,32 --> 0:18:57,302
This was Italy.


309
0:18:57,302 --> 0:18:59,338
Bombs were raining down on Italy,


310
0:18:59,338 --> 0:19:1,74
reducing large sections to rubble.


311
0:19:1,74 --> 0:19:6,878
In 1944, the Allies entered Pisa
hoping to control the Arno River,


312
0:19:6,878 --> 0:19:10,616
which ran through the city on its
way to the Mediterranean Sea.


313
0:19:10,616 --> 0:19:14,486
The Allied troops found themselves
under attack by artillery fire


314
0:19:14,486 --> 0:19:16,54
from above.


315
0:19:16,54 --> 0:19:19,891
But where could it be coming from?


316
0:19:19,891 --> 0:19:23,662
The Germans, as they were retreating
demolished all the bell towers


317
0:19:23,662 --> 0:19:26,31
because they could be
observation posts.


318
0:19:26,31 --> 0:19:29,368
So the bell towers of important
churches were demolished.


319
0:19:29,368 --> 0:19:32,337
Obviously the most important of the
bell towers was this one


320
0:19:32,337 --> 0:19:35,474
and it has not been demolished.


321
0:19:35,474 --> 0:19:40,579
The Allies suspected the Germans were
firing from the Leaning Tower of Pisa.


322
0:19:40,579 --> 0:19:44,716
US Sergeant Leon Weckstein, a scout
with the 91st Infantry division,


323
0:19:44,716 --> 0:19:50,355
received his orders in July 1944.
He was to take out what soldiers called,


324
0:19:50,355 --> 0:19:51,723
The Tiltin' Hilton,


325
0:19:51,723 --> 0:19:57,362
and if he detected any enemy action
blow it to smithereens.


326
0:19:57,362 --> 0:20:0,265
Weckstein would recall his
mission 50 years later


327
0:20:0,265 --> 0:20:3,302
in his memoir, Through My Eyes.


328
0:20:3,302 --> 0:20:7,139
I was sent out to get as close as
I could to the Tower.


329
0:20:7,139 --> 0:20:12,144
And if I saw any action up there
at all, I was to direct all


330
0:20:12,144 --> 0:20:15,681
these weapons against the Tower
to get it out of the way.


331
0:20:15,681 --> 0:20:21,653
In those days, we were very gung-ho.


332
0:20:21,653 --> 0:20:25,757
If it meant the life of one of
our men, we would have destroyed


333
0:20:25,757 --> 0:20:27,726
the Tower very easily.


334
0:20:27,726 --> 0:20:29,594
Weckstein watched for hours.


335
0:20:29,594 --> 0:20:32,64
Nothing seemed move inside
the Tower.


336
0:20:32,64 --> 0:20:36,234
He thought about blasting it to
pieces anyway, just in case.


337
0:20:36,234 --> 0:20:40,806
On a basis of suspicion, I might
have just said, go ahead,


338
0:20:40,806 --> 0:20:42,274
fire, you know?


339
0:20:42,274 --> 0:20:44,943
But there might have been an ounce
of sentiment in seeing


340
0:20:44,943 --> 0:20:53,51
this beautiful Tower and what it was.
And probably that registered


341
0:20:53,51 --> 0:20:58,89
strongly enough for me to withhold
any rash movement on my part.


342
0:20:58,89 --> 0:21:3,528
Then, artillery bursts began
exploding above Weckstein's head.


343
0:21:3,528 --> 0:21:5,597
Judging by the direction of the fire,


344
0:21:5,597 --> 0:21:9,668
Weckstein reported to his commander
that there were Germans in the Tower.


345
0:21:9,668 --> 0:21:14,773
The fate of the building hung on the
US Army's next decision.


346
0:21:14,773 --> 0:21:18,343
At the last minute, Weckstein was
ordered to retreat.


347
0:21:18,343 --> 0:21:20,879
The army had spared the
beautiful building.


348
0:21:20,879 --> 0:21:24,483
The Leaning Tower of Pisa had
survived World War II,


349
0:21:24,483 --> 0:21:27,853
for the most part.


350
0:21:27,853 --> 0:21:31,69
The only serious damage to the Tower
during the war was the breaking


351
0:21:31,69 --> 0:21:33,191
of a small column,


352
0:21:33,191 --> 0:21:38,497
not due indeed to the Allied Forces
attacks, but simply to a mistake of the


353
0:21:38,497 --> 0:21:42,634
Pisan anti-aircraft, which was not
capable of striking one aircraft


354
0:21:42,634 --> 0:21:43,735
during the whole war,


355
0:21:43,735 --> 0:21:49,141
but was able to strike a small
column of the bell Tower.


356
0:21:49,141 --> 0:21:52,544
In the post war years, the Tower
became a favorite attraction


357
0:21:52,544 --> 0:21:54,312
for tourists in Europe.


358
0:21:54,312 --> 0:21:57,949
Meanwhile, it continued its
slow swoop downward.


359
0:21:57,949 --> 0:22:1,42
At the beginning of the century
there was not a great concern


360
0:22:1,42 --> 0:22:2,587
about the tower.


361
0:22:2,587 --> 0:22:9,928
And even in 1940,1950, the increase
of inclination was very, very little.


362
0:22:9,928 --> 0:22:15,634
But the speed of inclination
increased so in 1990 it was doubled.


363
0:22:15,634 --> 0:22:19,638
By the end of the 1980's, the Tower
was leaning 17 feet off


364
0:22:19,638 --> 0:22:21,44
the perpendicular.


365
0:22:21,44 --> 0:22:25,51
The more the Tower leaned, the more
its unevenly distributed


366
0:22:25,51 --> 0:22:27,379
weight pressed against
the blocks of marble


367
0:22:27,379 --> 0:22:30,115
that made up its thin facade


368
0:22:30,115 --> 0:22:33,351
and the greater the risk that
the marble would give way.


369
0:22:33,351 --> 0:22:37,989
The Tower obviously was ever
in the danger of collapse,


370
0:22:37,989 --> 0:22:44,596
but with the progressive inclination
the safety margin was decreasing.


371
0:22:44,596 --> 0:22:49,801
The collapse of Tower was expected in
next 30 to 50 years.


372
0:22:49,801 --> 0:22:51,269
Despite the growing risk,


373
0:22:51,269 --> 0:22:55,774
the Italian government didn't authorize
any action until 1989,


374
0:22:55,774 --> 0:23:0,745
when a 900-year old bell tower in
nearby Pavia came crashing down.


375
0:23:0,745 --> 0:23:3,48
And it wasn't even leaning.


376
0:23:3,48 --> 0:23:5,45
This was sudden collapse.


377
0:23:5,45 --> 0:23:8,487
It took ten or 20 seconds, not more.


378
0:23:8,487 --> 0:23:15,393
And unfortunately we had some
people killed in that collapse.


379
0:23:15,393 --> 0:23:19,297
The Italian government announced
that Pisa's Tower was unsafe.


380
0:23:19,297 --> 0:23:22,467
No longer would the Leaning Tower
be able to welcome the hundreds


381
0:23:22,467 --> 0:23:26,705
of thousands of people who traveled
from everywhere to see it.


382
0:23:26,705 --> 0:23:29,908
At three o'clock on January seventh
1990,


383
0:23:29,908 --> 0:23:36,781
Italy's most famous building
closed its doors.


384
0:23:36,781 --> 0:23:39,918
To see the Tower closed for the
first time in its history


385
0:23:39,918 --> 0:23:41,62
for security reasons,


386
0:23:41,62 --> 0:23:50,395
it made you realize that there was
a real risk, a concrete danger.


387
0:23:50,395 --> 0:23:52,731
That day I cried.
What a sin.


388
0:23:52,731 --> 0:23:54,165
It was beautiful.


389
0:23:54,165 --> 0:23:58,37
Then to see the Tower without anyone
in it, it was no longer beautiful.


390
0:23:58,37 --> 0:24:2,841
It was sad, very sad.


391
0:24:2,841 --> 0:24:5,51
The closing of the Leaning Tower
of Pisa could have been


392
0:24:5,51 --> 0:24:6,945
easily avoided.


393
0:24:6,945 --> 0:24:10,682
This was done to dramatize the
problems that the Tower faced


394
0:24:10,682 --> 0:24:14,19
and in order to justify this
radical intervention.


395
0:24:14,19 --> 0:24:16,521
Because when there is
a dramatic case,


396
0:24:16,521 --> 0:24:23,428
a close danger, then the money
is forthcoming.


397
0:24:23,428 --> 0:24:27,299
In 1990, the Italian government
formed a committee of engineers


398
0:24:27,299 --> 0:24:30,35
to save the Tower once
and for all.


399
0:24:30,35 --> 0:24:33,405
They began by reviewing
potential solutions.


400
0:24:33,405 --> 0:24:36,341
Proposals poured in from
all over the world.


401
0:24:36,341 --> 0:24:39,611
You get some really wacky ideas
like balloons and growing


402
0:24:39,611 --> 0:24:42,28
trees up the middle
and so on,


403
0:24:42,28 --> 0:25:6,271
which are good fun
but not very serious.


404
0:25:6,271 --> 0:25:11,142
As creative solutions were studied
engineers gathered data.


405
0:25:11,142 --> 0:25:13,912
Measurements taken throughout the
century, were used to


406
0:25:13,912 --> 0:25:16,214
track the Tower's lean.


407
0:25:16,214 --> 0:25:20,652
And in 1992, a computerized
monitoring system was installed


408
0:25:20,652 --> 0:25:23,788
to keep track of the Tower's
smallest movements.


409
0:25:23,788 --> 0:25:26,625
Sensors were attached to
very major crack.


410
0:25:26,625 --> 0:25:30,595
If a crack widened, it could be
the start of a structural collapse.


411
0:25:30,595 --> 0:25:36,668
These instruments, measure the
thickness of the crack in real time,


412
0:25:36,668 --> 0:25:43,908
so we have nine years of recording
of the movements of these cracks.


413
0:25:43,908 --> 0:25:47,345
A routine was established that
continues to this day.


414
0:25:47,345 --> 0:25:53,251
Every morning a technician enters
the tower to check on its condition.


415
0:25:53,251 --> 0:25:55,253
Through a horizontally leveled
telescope,


416
0:25:55,253 --> 0:25:58,523
any increase in the tower's tilt can
be detected up to


417
0:25:58,523 --> 0:26:2,16
one 100th of a millimeter.


418
0:26:2,16 --> 0:26:5,563
Taut wires cut across the tower to
measure any distortion


419
0:26:5,563 --> 0:26:8,4
in the structure.


420
0:26:8,4 --> 0:26:12,237
Three pendulums incased in gray tubes
track any shift


421
0:26:12,237 --> 0:26:13,972
in the tower's center.


422
0:26:13,972 --> 0:26:20,311
They hang from the seventh level
down to the first floor.


423
0:26:20,311 --> 0:26:24,249
After two years, the team studying
the Tower still couldn't agree


424
0:26:24,249 --> 0:26:25,784
on how to fiix it.


425
0:26:25,784 --> 0:26:30,355
But they were ready to try some
temporary solutions.


426
0:26:30,355 --> 0:26:34,492
Their first task was to strengthen
the Tower at its weakest point,


427
0:26:34,492 --> 0:26:36,227
the critical zone.


428
0:26:36,227 --> 0:26:42,1
The inclination of the Tower is
creating very high compression


429
0:26:42,1 --> 0:26:43,435
on this side,


430
0:26:43,435 --> 0:26:47,338
because the Tower is inclined
in this direction.


431
0:26:47,338 --> 0:26:52,31
This edge is really the position
in which the compression


432
0:26:52,31 --> 0:26:54,412
stress is the highest one.


433
0:26:54,412 --> 0:27:0,652
So the fail of the collapse would
begin certainly in this position


434
0:27:0,652 --> 0:27:2,687
if would happen.


435
0:27:2,687 --> 0:27:5,757
Workers wrapped a belt of plastic
covered steel cables


436
0:27:5,757 --> 0:27:8,827
around the Tower's second story in
an effort to keep the cracks


437
0:27:8,827 --> 0:27:10,895
from widening further.


438
0:27:10,895 --> 0:27:13,465
The operation went smoothly.


439
0:27:13,465 --> 0:27:18,169
The band of steel was discreet enough
not to arouse any protest.


440
0:27:18,169 --> 0:27:22,774
Then, over the course of six months
600 tons of lead weights


441
0:27:22,774 --> 0:27:26,478
were methodically added to the base
of the north side to keep the lean


442
0:27:26,478 --> 0:27:29,981
from getting worse.


443
0:27:29,981 --> 0:27:34,452
The first lead weight was added on
July 13, 1993.


444
0:27:34,452 --> 0:27:37,522
Nervous engineers recorded every
step of the process


445
0:27:37,522 --> 0:27:39,557
with their own cameras.


446
0:27:39,557 --> 0:27:43,128
Tests were carried out to calculate
how the Tower was reacting


447
0:27:43,128 --> 0:27:44,763
to the lead weights.


448
0:27:44,763 --> 0:27:48,32
But nothing is certain with
a building that is so unique.


449
0:27:48,32 --> 0:27:52,537
We put the first lead weight on
and we got a positive response.


450
0:27:52,537 --> 0:27:55,173
Because it was by no means certain
that we would,


451
0:27:55,173 --> 0:27:56,574
it was very nerve wracking.


452
0:27:56,574 --> 0:28:0,578
The tension was really very high indeed.


453
0:28:0,578 --> 0:28:2,814
After the last weight was added,


454
0:28:2,814 --> 0:28:7,152
monitors registered a northward
movement of almost an inch.


455
0:28:7,152 --> 0:28:10,722
The intervention had been a success.


456
0:28:10,722 --> 0:28:12,69
It was a historical moment.


457
0:28:12,69 --> 0:28:16,261
For the first time in 800 years
the Leaning Tower of Pisa


458
0:28:16,261 --> 0:28:19,97
moved back the other way.


459
0:28:19,97 --> 0:28:21,132
There was just one snag.


460
0:28:21,132 --> 0:28:23,701
The lead weights were an eyesore.


461
0:28:23,701 --> 0:28:25,703
Art experts protested.


462
0:28:25,703 --> 0:28:27,672
The people of Pisa complained.


463
0:28:27,672 --> 0:28:29,44
The weights had to go.


464
0:28:29,44 --> 0:28:31,976
The lead weights are rather ugly.


465
0:28:31,976 --> 0:28:34,913
And in Italy they have a saying
that anything temporary


466
0:28:34,913 --> 0:28:36,848
becomes permanent.


467
0:28:36,848 --> 0:28:41,386
And so, the Tower's engineers came up
with a daring and complex plan,


468
0:28:41,386 --> 0:28:47,959
a plan that some feared would destroy
the treasured Tower.


469
0:28:47,959 --> 0:28:50,795
The plan to eliminate the weights
holding the Tower down was


470
0:28:50,795 --> 0:28:53,765
so controversial and so
filled with danger,


471
0:28:53,765 --> 0:28:57,635
that it's outcome came to be
known as Black September.


472
0:28:57,635 --> 0:29:1,272
The idea was to build a concrete
ring round the Tower's base


473
0:29:1,272 --> 0:29:4,843
from which ten cables would be
driven 50 meters underground


474
0:29:4,843 --> 0:29:7,412
to anchor the Tower in place.


475
0:29:7,412 --> 0:29:10,582
Laying the concrete ring was
a dangerous task.


476
0:29:10,582 --> 0:29:13,885
Workers would have to dig under
the catino, the walkway


477
0:29:13,885 --> 0:29:15,286
around the base of the Tower.


478
0:29:15,286 --> 0:29:18,523
The ground was full of water and
once digging started,


479
0:29:18,523 --> 0:29:20,491
the water might gush up.


480
0:29:20,491 --> 0:29:25,96
But the engineers in charge were
confident they had a way around that.


481
0:29:25,96 --> 0:29:28,466
The ground would be frozen
using liquid nitrogen.


482
0:29:28,466 --> 0:29:31,35
The frozen ground would form
a physical barrier


483
0:29:31,35 --> 0:29:33,671
that would stop ground water
from flowing into the shallow


484
0:29:33,671 --> 0:29:37,742
excavation the concrete ring
would be built in.


485
0:29:37,742 --> 0:29:41,746
Before the freeze started, engineers
came across something puzzling.


486
0:29:41,746 --> 0:29:44,682
There was already another concrete
ring in the ground,


487
0:29:44,682 --> 0:29:47,118
and it was attached to the Tower.


488
0:29:47,118 --> 0:29:50,588
Engineers guessed that it dated
back to the 1800's.


489
0:29:50,588 --> 0:29:53,524
There was nothing about this ring
in historical records,


490
0:29:53,524 --> 0:29:56,294
but it seemed safe to go ahead.


491
0:29:56,294 --> 0:30:4,636
On September seventh, workers
started freezing the ground.


492
0:30:4,636 --> 0:30:6,838
They made some holes
around the tower.


493
0:30:6,838 --> 0:30:10,108
And inside these holes
they put liquid nitrogen,


494
0:30:10,108 --> 0:30:13,411
practically transforming all the
ground underneath the tower


495
0:30:13,411 --> 0:30:17,115
into a freezer.


496
0:30:17,115 --> 0:30:21,286
For 36 hours liquid nitrogen
was pumped into the soil.


497
0:30:21,286 --> 0:30:24,389
At first, the Tower didn't react.


498
0:30:24,389 --> 0:30:28,993
Then over night, the Tower suddenly
moved one 16th of an inch,


499
0:30:28,993 --> 0:30:32,196
an amount almost equal to what the
tower moves in a year.


500
0:30:32,196 --> 0:30:36,367
As we froze the ground
the ice reacted against


501
0:30:36,367 --> 0:30:38,336
this concrete in the ground


502
0:30:38,336 --> 0:30:41,673
and caused the tower to
move adversely.


503
0:30:41,673 --> 0:30:45,276
And as soon as that happened
we stopped the job.


504
0:30:45,276 --> 0:30:48,212
When the water in the soil froze
it expanded.


505
0:30:48,212 --> 0:30:51,382
The expanded soil pushed the
concrete ring down,


506
0:30:51,382 --> 0:30:54,352
leaving a gap between the Tower
and the ring.


507
0:30:54,352 --> 0:30:58,589
Once the soil defrosted, the tower
sank down into this space,


508
0:30:58,589 --> 0:31:0,558
and lurched further south.


509
0:31:0,558 --> 0:31:2,527
I was extremely worried.


510
0:31:2,527 --> 0:31:7,231
And this was really a very
very difficult week.


511
0:31:7,231 --> 0:31:11,869
We faced a serious risk of losing
the tower, because


512
0:31:11,869 --> 0:31:18,543
when Tower started to rotate toward
the south with this rate,


513
0:31:18,543 --> 0:31:25,116
nobody was able to evaluate
if the Tower will stop or not.


514
0:31:25,116 --> 0:31:27,752
Desperate to stop the Tower from
leaning further,


515
0:31:27,752 --> 0:31:31,823
engineers quickly added another
230 tons of lead weight to


516
0:31:31,823 --> 0:31:33,624
the Tower's base.


517
0:31:33,624 --> 0:31:35,126
The Tower stopped moving.


518
0:31:35,126 --> 0:31:38,129
But instead of fewer weights
there were now more.


519
0:31:38,129 --> 0:31:41,632
And the tilt, instead of diminishing
was increasing.


520
0:31:41,632 --> 0:31:46,137
Nothing had gone according to plan.


521
0:31:46,137 --> 0:31:50,141
This is a strange monument and one
that has had too many doctors


522
0:31:50,141 --> 0:31:51,542
trying to fiix it.


523
0:31:51,542 --> 0:31:54,545
The Tower has most often been
at risk of falling down,


524
0:31:54,545 --> 0:31:56,28
not from what ails it,


525
0:31:56,28 --> 0:32:0,18
but due to the mistakes of its doctors
who have been exaggerating


526
0:32:0,18 --> 0:32:1,185
with their cure.


527
0:32:1,185 --> 0:32:4,389
In effect, the Tower has most often been
in danger when there


528
0:32:4,389 --> 0:32:8,793
were external interventions.


529
0:32:8,793 --> 0:32:10,728
All of Italy was outraged.


530
0:32:10,728 --> 0:32:14,332
After five years of studying the Tower
with the most advanced


531
0:32:14,332 --> 0:32:15,9
technology available,


532
0:32:15,9 --> 0:32:20,238
somehow the problem was worse.


533
0:32:20,238 --> 0:32:27,879
Shortly after the deep freeze of 1995
all work on the Tower stopped.


534
0:32:27,879 --> 0:32:30,214
The Tower remained closed.


535
0:32:30,214 --> 0:32:34,719
No one in Pisa knew when, if ever
it would open again.


536
0:32:34,719 --> 0:32:38,89
It was a painful situation for a city
that identified so completely


537
0:32:38,89 --> 0:32:41,25
with the monument.


538
0:32:41,25 --> 0:32:41,859
It's the maximum.


539
0:32:41,859 --> 0:32:43,361
It's the emblem of the city.


540
0:32:43,361 --> 0:32:46,497
Because when we go around the world
when we say where we are from,


541
0:32:46,497 --> 0:32:52,804
that we are from Pisa, the first the
first association is the Tower.


542
0:32:52,804 --> 0:32:56,541
The Tower is a universal symbol
for the citizens of Pisa.


543
0:32:56,541 --> 0:32:59,41
As a little girl I used to always
come here to the Piazza.


544
0:32:59,41 --> 0:33:3,381
And slowly, a passion began to
grow within me as I became aware


545
0:33:3,381 --> 0:33:12,457
and began to understand the
importance of the monument.


546
0:33:12,457 --> 0:33:15,893
The Tower was like a lung
something that we felt.


547
0:33:15,893 --> 0:33:19,897
Not only because people had once
climbed it, that makes it alive,


548
0:33:19,897 --> 0:33:26,404
but also because closing it brings
a little economic damage.


549
0:33:26,404 --> 0:33:29,607
Pisans from all walks of life felt
the closing of the Tower


550
0:33:29,607 --> 0:33:30,708
in their hearts,


551
0:33:30,708 --> 0:33:33,444
not to mention their pocket books.


552
0:33:33,444 --> 0:33:35,68
It's the Tower
that attracts the tourist.


553
0:33:35,68 --> 0:33:39,383
As soon as tourists arrive, they see
the Tower and that's it.


554
0:33:39,383 --> 0:33:41,819
They don't see the other things.


555
0:33:41,819 --> 0:33:45,523
When the Tower was open, there was
a line, the people would climb


556
0:33:45,523 --> 0:33:48,559
on the Tower, they would have
time to eat, they would come


557
0:33:48,559 --> 0:33:49,694
to our restaurants.


558
0:33:49,694 --> 0:33:52,13
A lot of people would stop to
have a cappuccino.


559
0:33:52,13 --> 0:33:54,398
And then they would go inside
the Tower.


560
0:33:54,398 --> 0:33:58,202
Now instead, since the Tower is
shut down, our work is a


561
0:33:58,202 --> 0:33:59,17
hit and run.


562
0:33:59,17 --> 0:34:2,874
Tourists arrive, they take some
pictures, they do a little bit


563
0:34:2,874 --> 0:34:4,709
of shopping for some souvenirs,


564
0:34:4,709 --> 0:34:7,845
and then they run away.


565
0:34:7,845 --> 0:34:11,849
With the Tower closed, tourism
fell by 20 percent.


566
0:34:11,849 --> 0:34:15,219
It was a frustrating situation
for the people of Pisa.


567
0:34:15,219 --> 0:34:21,159
They depended on tourism and tourism
depends on the Tower.


568
0:34:21,159 --> 0:34:24,929
It is considered one of the most
famous structures in the world.


569
0:34:24,929 --> 0:34:28,599
I believe that there cannot be
a person on earth that doesn't know


570
0:34:28,599 --> 0:34:31,469
what the Tower of Pisa is.


571
0:34:31,469 --> 0:34:35,173
Tourists come from Japan, from
America, from Canada,


572
0:34:35,173 --> 0:34:36,14
from Australia.


573
0:34:36,14 --> 0:34:39,43
These are people that have never
seen the Tower before,


574
0:34:39,43 --> 0:34:41,913
and they come here expressly to see
the Tower.


575
0:34:41,913 --> 0:34:43,447
Not to see the city.


576
0:34:43,447 --> 0:34:49,42
For us, the Tower is an artistic
wealth, a priceless property.


577
0:34:49,42 --> 0:34:52,39
There was great concern about the
alterations being made to


578
0:34:52,39 --> 0:34:54,192
this priceless property.


579
0:34:54,192 --> 0:34:58,62
At Columbia University in New York
James Beck, a professor


580
0:34:58,62 --> 0:35:0,698
of art history has founded Art Watch,


581
0:35:0,698 --> 0:35:3,267
a non profit watchdog organization


582
0:35:3,267 --> 0:35:6,537
dedicated to protecting
artistic treasures.


583
0:35:6,537 --> 0:35:10,608
Beck advocates an open exchange
of ideas to save the Tower.


584
0:35:10,608 --> 0:35:15,379
It's very bad for the preservation of
the Tower that they're so secretive.


585
0:35:15,379 --> 0:35:20,384
They put in a particular cure
and then that cure fails


586
0:35:20,384 --> 0:35:22,119
and they put in another cure,


587
0:35:22,119 --> 0:35:25,456
but there's never discussion
and careful explanation.


588
0:35:25,456 --> 0:35:29,93
If you believe that this is an object
that belongs to the world,


589
0:35:29,93 --> 0:35:33,464
then you have to have all of the
input that's possible.


590
0:35:33,464 --> 0:35:36,634
Beck believed that the Tower was
not in imminent danger.


591
0:35:36,634 --> 0:35:39,704
There was time enough to debate
the options openly.


592
0:35:39,704 --> 0:35:42,607
The estimates are 35 to 70 years.


593
0:35:42,607 --> 0:35:47,245
Therefore, the rush to do
these rather stupid interventions


594
0:35:47,245 --> 0:35:50,648
in some cases, was totally unnecessary.


595
0:35:50,648 --> 0:35:53,551
Everybody wanted to get credit for
saving the Tower of Pisa,


596
0:35:53,551 --> 0:35:55,319
just because it was good publicity.


597
0:35:55,319 --> 0:35:59,423
Whatever the objection of critics,
by 1998, a new plan


598
0:35:59,423 --> 0:36:0,891
had been set in motion.


599
0:36:0,891 --> 0:36:8,65
And if it worked, the Tower would
be safe for hundreds of years.


600
0:36:8,65 --> 0:36:11,702
Italy's team of engineers felt
confident that it had come up


601
0:36:11,702 --> 0:36:14,5
with a way to stabilize the Tower.


602
0:36:14,5 --> 0:36:18,175
Their solution was a process
called soil extraction.


603
0:36:18,175 --> 0:36:22,79
Engineers would remove soil
from the north side of the Tower.


604
0:36:22,79 --> 0:36:25,516
The remaining soil would start to
compress to fill in the gaps


605
0:36:25,516 --> 0:36:29,12
and the north side would literally
settle down.


606
0:36:29,12 --> 0:36:34,191
We looked at, at least 12 different
methods of doing it.


607
0:36:34,191 --> 0:36:37,795
But the more we looked at it
the more we felt


608
0:36:37,795 --> 0:36:41,699
that we had to get gravity
to work for us.


609
0:36:41,699 --> 0:36:46,237
Most of the solutions had been
try to lift the low side.


610
0:36:46,237 --> 0:36:49,4
Do something to support
the south side.


611
0:36:49,4 --> 0:36:52,476
But in doing that the ground
is so soft you would disturb it


612
0:36:52,476 --> 0:36:55,79
and probably the Tower would
fall over.


613
0:36:55,79 --> 0:36:59,617
And so this solution developed
that maybe we could cause


614
0:36:59,617 --> 0:37:4,188
the north side of the ground to
subside in some way.


615
0:37:4,188 --> 0:37:7,24
And the tower would follow that
gravity would cause


616
0:37:7,24 --> 0:37:9,627
the tower to rotate northwards.


617
0:37:9,627 --> 0:37:11,62
If the project succeeded,


618
0:37:11,62 --> 0:37:15,399
the Tower's lean would be reduced by
half a degree, or 16 inches.


619
0:37:15,399 --> 0:37:18,269
Visually, the change would be
imperceptible.


620
0:37:18,269 --> 0:37:21,839
That means that for American
and Japanese tourists


621
0:37:21,839 --> 0:37:25,81
this will make practically
no difference.


622
0:37:25,81 --> 0:37:30,648
The local Pisans greeted the
new plan with skepticism.


623
0:37:30,648 --> 0:37:32,65
They've required a lot of time


624
0:37:32,65 --> 0:37:36,62
to fiind a way that could insure
security and stability to he work,


625
0:37:36,62 --> 0:37:38,522
that won't present any problems,


626
0:37:38,522 --> 0:37:41,58
because the Tower could
go down very fast.


627
0:37:41,58 --> 0:37:42,593
One mistake is enough,


628
0:37:42,593 --> 0:37:47,365
and when the Tower comes down
who's going to stop it?


629
0:37:47,365 --> 0:37:51,836
Soil extraction is a relatively rare
technique, but far from new.


630
0:37:51,836 --> 0:37:53,771
As early as the 1800's,


631
0:37:53,771 --> 0:37:58,476
it had been used to diminish the lean
on St. Chad's Tower in England.


632
0:37:58,476 --> 0:38:0,945
More recently it had been used
successfully


633
0:38:0,945 --> 0:38:5,349
on the Metropolitan Cathedral
in Mexico City.


634
0:38:5,349 --> 0:38:6,484
But remarkably,


635
0:38:6,484 --> 0:38:11,88
the technique had been recommended
for the Tower of Pisa in 1962,


636
0:38:11,88 --> 0:38:18,763
when Fernando Terracina, an Italian
architect, had submitted the idea.


637
0:38:18,763 --> 0:38:21,399
What has the committee done
in the end?


638
0:38:21,399 --> 0:38:26,137
After spending ten years and 25
million dollars, what does it do?


639
0:38:26,137 --> 0:38:28,973
It accepts a project by Fernando
Terracina,


640
0:38:28,973 --> 0:38:33,944
a project of under-excavation
from the 1960's.


641
0:38:33,944 --> 0:38:36,647
Terracina's suggestion was easy
to miss.


642
0:38:36,647 --> 0:38:41,385
It was buried in a technical report
three decades old.


643
0:38:41,385 --> 0:38:44,555
What further astonished critics was
that the idea had been


644
0:38:44,555 --> 0:38:46,557
suggested again in 1990


645
0:38:46,557 --> 0:38:50,194
by Vittorio Novelli and Nazareno
Paccaloni, surveyors


646
0:38:50,194 --> 0:38:57,935
from Cesna, Italy.


647
0:38:57,935 --> 0:39:0,805
They told us it was a process that
was too violent


648
0:39:0,805 --> 0:39:3,7
and impossible to carry out.


649
0:39:3,7 --> 0:39:7,211
I kept in with the president of the
committee who, very cordially,


650
0:39:7,211 --> 0:39:10,448
told me that he was trying to fiind a
unanimous decision


651
0:39:10,448 --> 0:39:12,55
on the choice of an intervention.


652
0:39:12,55 --> 0:39:16,454
And that our project wasn't taken
into consideration.


653
0:39:16,454 --> 0:39:17,788
Yet, in the end,


654
0:39:17,788 --> 0:39:21,692
the committee adopted an operation
with many similarities to ours.


655
0:39:21,692 --> 0:39:25,563
In fact, we were a little bit
astonished after such a long time,


656
0:39:25,563 --> 0:39:29,66
nine years.


657
0:39:29,66 --> 0:39:30,401
With so much at stake


658
0:39:30,401 --> 0:39:33,404
and with the eyes of the world upon
the current team of engineers,


659
0:39:33,404 --> 0:39:36,73
everyone's nerves became strained.


660
0:39:36,73 --> 0:39:39,43
It's been incredibly tense.


661
0:39:39,43 --> 0:39:41,779
You can imagine you don't rush into
a tower that is on the point


662
0:39:41,779 --> 0:39:43,18
of falling over


663
0:39:43,18 --> 0:39:46,717
and start digging furiously.


664
0:39:46,717 --> 0:39:50,54
This risk is huge because the Tower
could feel unstable


665
0:39:50,54 --> 0:39:53,29
from one moment to the next
since it has been in this position


666
0:39:53,29 --> 0:39:54,825
for so many centuries.


667
0:39:54,825 --> 0:39:59,797
We are now all in the hands of
these people, waiting.


668
0:39:59,797 --> 0:40:2,66
It just seems to me it's
Keystone Cops.


669
0:40:2,66 --> 0:40:5,803
And that fact that they had five
different operational plans


670
0:40:5,803 --> 0:40:7,538
in ten years,


671
0:40:7,538 --> 0:40:11,775
shows that they're not very secure
about what they're doing.


672
0:40:11,775 --> 0:40:13,677
The committee believes in its plan.


673
0:40:13,677 --> 0:40:16,113
But just in case the Tower moved
the wrong way,


674
0:40:16,113 --> 0:40:20,618
it proposed wrapping two steel cables
around the Tower's third level.


675
0:40:20,618 --> 0:40:25,823
The cables were to be anchored into
the ground, 100 yards away.


676
0:40:25,823 --> 0:40:29,293
If catastrophe struck during the soil
extraction, the cables could be


677
0:40:29,293 --> 0:40:34,131
tensioned to hold the Tower in place.


678
0:40:34,131 --> 0:40:38,102
There was never any intention
that we would use the cables to


679
0:40:38,102 --> 0:40:39,803
pull the Tower back.


680
0:40:39,803 --> 0:40:42,54
I think there was one newspaper
article, which said,


681
0:40:42,54 --> 0:40:47,77
"They are going to irresponsibly
drag the Tower back by the cables."


682
0:40:47,77 --> 0:40:48,679
That was never the intention.


683
0:40:48,679 --> 0:40:54,885
They're simply there to gently hold
the Tower if it began to move.


684
0:40:54,885 --> 0:40:59,356
The cables would in that event
be tensioned by lead weights


685
0:40:59,356 --> 0:41:2,326
so the load on them
would be constant.


686
0:41:2,326 --> 0:41:5,29
Work began in December 1998.


687
0:41:5,29 --> 0:41:9,533
Putting the cables in position
was a major and perilous task.


688
0:41:9,533 --> 0:41:15,105
Each cable was 340 feet long
and two inches thick.


689
0:41:15,105 --> 0:41:24,882
They were enormously heavy. Just ten
yards of cable weighed a half a ton.


690
0:41:24,882 --> 0:41:28,886
We felt that it was necessary to have
those there just so that


691
0:41:28,886 --> 0:41:32,222
if something went wrong, we could
hold the Tower and


692
0:41:32,222 --> 0:41:34,658
fiind out what was happening
and correct it.


693
0:41:34,658 --> 0:41:38,963
So they are simply a safe guard
and the contractor


694
0:41:38,963 --> 0:41:42,733
calls them his parachute.


695
0:41:42,733 --> 0:41:45,803
With parachute in place, the way
was clear to start


696
0:41:45,803 --> 0:41:49,239
extracting the soil.


697
0:41:49,239 --> 0:41:51,842
On the tenth of February, 1999,


698
0:41:51,842 --> 0:41:55,12
engineers recorded the start
of the process.


699
0:41:55,12 --> 0:41:58,382
First 12 pipes were placed
approximately four yards


700
0:41:58,382 --> 0:42:3,354
from the edge of the Tower.


701
0:42:3,354 --> 0:42:6,991
Then, with a kind of mechanical
corkscrew, the ground was


702
0:42:6,991 --> 0:42:11,862
removed very gradually
from beneath the bell tower.


703
0:42:11,862 --> 0:42:14,798
At the end of five months
the results were in.


704
0:42:14,798 --> 0:42:18,369
The Tower had moved over half
an inch north.


705
0:42:18,369 --> 0:42:21,605
For the committee, the victory
couldn't have been sweeter.


706
0:42:21,605 --> 0:42:26,21
Finally, after ten years, they had
found a method to stabilize the Tower.


707
0:42:26,21 --> 0:42:29,947
The response has been beyond our
wildest expectations.


708
0:42:29,947 --> 0:42:31,615
It's been very positive.


709
0:42:31,615 --> 0:42:34,685
We've moved the top of the tower
northwards just


710
0:42:34,685 --> 0:42:36,253
by drilling a few holes.


711
0:42:36,253 --> 0:42:40,29
Far fewer than we are going to use
with the full intervention.


712
0:42:40,29 --> 0:42:42,726
So at present, it's looking good.


713
0:42:42,726 --> 0:42:45,529
But you don't raise the flag when
you've taken the first


714
0:42:45,529 --> 0:42:47,197
step up Everest.


715
0:42:47,197 --> 0:42:50,334
So we have to be very
very careful.


716
0:42:50,334 --> 0:42:53,771
We've got a very, very long
way to go still.


717
0:42:53,771 --> 0:42:57,775
As it turned out, they had even
longer to go than they thought.


718
0:42:57,775 --> 0:43:4,848
Just as they began making progress
the money ran out.


719
0:43:4,848 --> 0:43:8,318
It's a paradox that at the exact
moment when the right project


720
0:43:8,318 --> 0:43:9,853
has fiinally been found,


721
0:43:9,853 --> 0:43:12,89
there is a risk that the funds to
develop it are lacking.


722
0:43:12,89 --> 0:43:16,226
So, we can see that the relationship
between the committee's work


723
0:43:16,226 --> 0:43:19,697
and the government's response has
always been a difficult one


724
0:43:19,697 --> 0:43:22,666
and sometimes even dramatic.


725
0:43:22,666 --> 0:43:25,602
The Tower that had survived 800 years
of danger,


726
0:43:25,602 --> 0:43:31,275
was now facing a truly formidable foe
the Italian bureaucracy.


727
0:43:31,275 --> 0:43:35,79
Although many people were infuriated
with the committee's slow pace,


728
0:43:35,79 --> 0:43:39,583
the committee placed the blame
squarely elsewhere, the government.


729
0:43:39,583 --> 0:43:44,888
The whole project has taken
an inordinate length of time...


730
0:43:44,888 --> 0:43:47,958
largely due to Italian bureaucracy.


731
0:43:47,958 --> 0:43:53,997
We are set up by a law, which has to
be renewed every two months,


732
0:43:53,997 --> 0:43:58,368
and very often it isn't. And we have
long, long periods of time,


733
0:43:58,368 --> 0:44:0,404
anything up to six months or more,


734
0:44:0,404 --> 0:44:2,239
where we have no mandate.


735
0:44:2,239 --> 0:44:4,341
And people say, "Why haven't you
done anything?"


736
0:44:4,341 --> 0:44:8,512
The simple answer is, ask the Italian
government.


737
0:44:8,512 --> 0:44:16,353
The mission to save the Tower was
once again on hold.


738
0:44:16,353 --> 0:44:20,324
While the bureaucratic wheels turn
slowly, life in Pisa goes on


739
0:44:20,324 --> 0:44:39,176
as it always has.


740
0:44:39,176 --> 0:44:42,98
The tourists who visit the Tower know
little of its complex history


741
0:44:42,98 --> 0:44:45,883
or how close it's
come to destruction.


742
0:44:45,883 --> 0:44:48,852
I read that they did something on
the foundation


743
0:44:48,852 --> 0:44:50,654
to keep it from falling over.


744
0:44:50,654 --> 0:44:53,724
They didn't want to set it
up straight, they'd lost tourism, hey?


745
0:44:53,724 --> 0:44:54,925
And I think they shouldn't.


746
0:44:54,925 --> 0:44:58,562
It's like if they take the smile away
from the Mona Lisa.


747
0:44:58,562 --> 0:45:0,364
It looks like it's going to fall over.


748
0:45:0,364 --> 0:45:2,266
Well, it was crooked when they
first built it,


749
0:45:2,266 --> 0:45:5,302
so I'm not surprised that it is still
crooked now.


750
0:45:5,302 --> 0:45:8,71
It does look different now when you
see it in real life compared


751
0:45:8,71 --> 0:45:9,439
to seeing it in books and magazines.


752
0:45:9,439 --> 0:45:11,375
It's quite different when you're
actually right there in front of it


753
0:45:11,375 --> 0:45:13,377
and you're trying to figure out how
it actually got like that


754
0:45:13,377 --> 0:45:14,878
and how it stays up.


755
0:45:14,878 --> 0:45:15,679
So, it's amazing.


756
0:45:15,679 --> 0:45:17,748
It's one example of something
that went wrong.


757
0:45:17,748 --> 0:45:19,817
But at the same time they're trying
to fiix it and it's going to


758
0:45:19,817 --> 0:45:20,784
be a nightmare.


759
0:45:20,784 --> 0:45:24,755
Just imagine somebody tries to
straighten it up and it falls apart.


760
0:45:24,755 --> 0:45:26,59
We wait.


761
0:45:26,59 --> 0:45:28,425
Who knows when it will fall?


762
0:45:28,425 --> 0:45:31,829
It is something everyone
wants to witness.


763
0:45:31,829 --> 0:45:35,32
As the Tower waits for the Italian
government to release funds


764
0:45:35,32 --> 0:45:37,835
so the soil extraction project
can resume,


765
0:45:37,835 --> 0:45:39,87
everyone else waits too.


766
0:45:39,87 --> 0:45:42,906
We are waiting of the Italian
government, because we are now


767
0:45:42,906 --> 0:45:47,845
not in position to start for a number
of bureaucratic


768
0:45:47,845 --> 0:45:49,746
and fiinancial problems.


769
0:45:49,746 --> 0:45:55,18
So that we are ready for May and now
we are in November waiting


770
0:45:55,18 --> 0:45:58,388
for someone saying to you, go.


771
0:45:58,388 --> 0:46:1,458
For everyone, even the engineers
working on the Tower,


772
0:46:1,458 --> 0:46:3,393
it has been a long journey.


773
0:46:3,393 --> 0:46:7,13
When the work will be fiinished
I shall be extremely


774
0:46:7,13 --> 0:46:10,734
happy to become a free citizen


775
0:46:10,734 --> 0:46:14,571
and not be involved in Pisa Tower
and not


776
0:46:14,571 --> 0:46:19,576
be involved, the mass media, not be
involved in the relations


777
0:46:19,576 --> 0:46:21,745
with politicians and so on.


778
0:46:21,745 --> 0:46:25,15
Pisans long for the day
the Tower will reopen.


779
0:46:25,15 --> 0:46:29,19
But no one expects that day
to come any time soon.


780
0:46:29,19 --> 0:46:31,889
Some political problems.
Some fiinancial.


781
0:46:31,889 --> 0:46:34,324
The funds arrive
they don't arrive.


782
0:46:34,324 --> 0:46:37,461
They close the building site
they threaten to close,


783
0:46:37,461 --> 0:46:40,264
then the money returns
and we start again.


784
0:46:40,264 --> 0:46:44,368
In short, these are all the things
that we Italians are used to


785
0:46:44,368 --> 0:46:47,537
and we have to be used to.


786
0:46:47,537 --> 0:46:50,7
Often I hear the elderly people of
Pisa say,


787
0:46:50,7 --> 0:46:51,508
"But how could it possibly be,


788
0:46:51,508 --> 0:46:54,478
in the year 2000, when everything
has been invented,


789
0:46:54,478 --> 0:46:57,848
and we live in an information age
where man has gone into space,


790
0:46:57,848 --> 0:47:3,287
that a tower like this one takes
more than ten years to stabilize?"


791
0:47:3,287 --> 0:47:6,99
At the beginning they were talking
about six months, then a year.


792
0:47:6,99 --> 0:47:10,694
Nobody could have known that the
work would last ten years


793
0:47:10,694 --> 0:47:13,53
and still continues.


794
0:47:13,53 --> 0:47:17,0
Once the soil extraction can be
exhumed and completed,


795
0:47:17,0 --> 0:47:20,37
the Tower will, presumably, be
stabilized and can be open to


796
0:47:20,37 --> 0:47:22,272
the public again.


797
0:47:22,272 --> 0:47:23,807
Or will it?


798
0:47:23,807 --> 0:47:28,946
The problem to open the Tower has
not yet been discussed


799
0:47:28,946 --> 0:47:30,314
by the committee.


800
0:47:30,314 --> 0:47:35,552
Because a large part of these people
believe that the Tower


801
0:47:35,552 --> 0:47:39,856
should be admired from the square
not climbing up.


802
0:47:39,856 --> 0:47:43,393
We expected that the Tower would
have opened again for the millennium.


803
0:47:43,393 --> 0:47:46,63
Instead we found out
that the work will go on


804
0:47:46,63 --> 0:47:48,432
and that nothing is certain
anymore.


805
0:47:48,432 --> 0:47:50,701
I fiind all of this deeply unfair.


806
0:47:50,701 --> 0:47:53,637
We are fighting to have the tower
reopened so that everyone


807
0:47:53,637 --> 0:47:57,708
can once again admire its beauty.


808
0:47:57,708 --> 0:48:0,811
We have faith and we hope to see
the Tower soon beautiful


809
0:48:0,811 --> 0:48:4,47
and smiling like once it was.


810
0:48:4,47 --> 0:48:7,25
No one can imagine a Pisa
without its Tower.


811
0:48:7,25 --> 0:48:9,86
The Tower is simply unique,


812
0:48:9,86 --> 0:48:12,723
with a unique hold on the imagination
of Italy and the world.


813
0:48:12,723 --> 0:48:16,59
There's a little quirk
in the wonderful Italian romance


814
0:48:16,59 --> 0:48:17,861
that likes things that are
a little different.


815
0:48:17,861 --> 0:48:20,33
And the fact that this is
a leaning tower,


816
0:48:20,33 --> 0:48:23,1
as opposed to just an old building,


817
0:48:23,1 --> 0:48:26,536
is romantic in their eyes.


818
0:48:26,536 --> 0:48:29,339
Actually, I'm convinced that no
architect in the world today


819
0:48:29,339 --> 0:48:32,142
would be capable of creating
a thing like this.


820
0:48:32,142 --> 0:48:35,912
They could dream of it, but
defiinitely not build it.


821
0:48:35,912 --> 0:48:38,548
Nature decided it would be tilted,


822
0:48:38,548 --> 0:48:40,283
that it would come out inclined,


823
0:48:40,283 --> 0:48:45,455
therefore people come to see this
miracle this is still standing.


824
0:48:45,455 --> 0:48:47,57
It is so magnificent.


825
0:48:47,57 --> 0:48:50,16
Such a beautiful structure.


826
0:48:50,16 --> 0:48:52,662
And the whole Piazza
is so beautiful.


827
0:48:52,662 --> 0:48:56,233
It really would be unthinkable
that the Tower should be


828
0:48:56,233 --> 0:48:58,468
lost really to the world.


829
0:48:58,468 --> 0:49:3,94
I hope the future is at least
another 300 years.


830
0:49:3,94 --> 0:49:8,412
The future of the Leaning Tower
of Pisa remains as uncertain as ever.


831
0:49:8,412 --> 0:49:12,682
But for 800 years the Tower
has risen above human folly,


832
0:49:12,682 --> 0:49:18,88
serenely surviving friend and foe.


833
0:49:18,88 --> 0:49:21,925
And it continues to do so today
soaring into the sky,


834
0:49:21,925 --> 0:49:26,496
magnificent and improbable
beautiful and strange,


835
0:49:26,496 --> 0:51:26,496
a wonder of the world.
