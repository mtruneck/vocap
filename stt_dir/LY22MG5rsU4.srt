here in Baghdad.

Right down there, that's
Firdos Square.

0:0:25,47 --> 0:0:29,45
That's where the famous scene
took place where Saddam


5
0:0:29,45 --> 0:0:31,64
Hussein's statue was
pulled down.

0:0:31,64 --> 0:0:34,53
We came here in 2006 when we
filmed "Heavy Metal in


7
0:0:34,53 --> 0:0:36,1
Baghdad."


8
0:0:36,1 --> 0:0:37,74
It was a very, very different
city then.

0:0:37,74 --> 0:0:39,72
It was the height of
the insurgency.


10
0:0:39,72 --> 0:0:43,32
It was a war zone,
full occupation.


11
0:0:43,32 --> 0:0:45,6
And that occupation
is now over.


12
0:0:45,6 --> 0:0:47,24
A year ago, America pulled
out their troops.

announcing that the American


14

combat mission in
Iraq has ended.

0:0:53,62 --> 0:0:56,72
Operation Iraqi Freedom
is over.


16
0:0:56,72 --> 0:0:59,15
Last February, I announced a
plan that would bring our


17
0:0:59,15 --> 0:1:2,55
combat brigades out of Iraq,
while re-doubling our efforts


18
0:1:2,55 --> 0:1:5,83
to strengthen Iraq's security
forces and support its


19
0:1:5,83 --> 0:1:7,53

That's what we've done.

24

It was the biggest news

25
0:1:16,19 --> 0:1:17,47
for almost a decade.


26
0:1:17,47 --> 0:1:19,56
And then overnight, it's over.


27
0:1:19,56 --> 0:1:23,36
So we wanted to come here and
see what the effects of this


28

occupation were.

When the Americans left, prime
minister Nouri Al-Malaki


31

intensified his efforts to
consolidate power among the


32
0:1:37,4 --> 0:1:38,91
Shia majority.

This Sunni minority, a group
that enjoyed great privilege


34
0:1:41,67 --> 0:1:44,61
under Saddam Hussein, have
been marginalized.


35
0:1:44,61 --> 0:1:48,42

taking this lying down.

in Sunni areas and a surge of


39
0:2:4,18 --> 0:2:7,52
sectarian killings throughout
the country become the new


40
0:2:7,52 --> 0:2:9,584
normal in postwar Iraq.


41
0:2:9,584 --> 0:2:16,33
In 2012 alone, there were
more than 1,600 deaths.


42
0:2:16,33 --> 0:2:19,62
Through making "Heavy Metal in
Baghdad," we met Waleed, the


43
0:2:19,62 --> 0:2:21,93
original singer of
Acrassicauda.


44
0:2:21,93 --> 0:2:25,968

only metal band in Iraq.

But shortly after that meeting,
Waleed was forced to


47
0:2:33,44 --> 0:2:36,41
flee the country and seek
refugee status in the West


48
0:2:36,41 --> 0:2:39,46
after receiving numerous
death threats.


49
0:2:39,46 --> 0:2:42,35
With the war officially over,
Waleed decided it was time to


50
0:2:42,35 --> 0:2:43,77
return to Iraq.


51
0:2:43,77 --> 0:2:47,39
It would be his first visit home
since he left in 2004.


52
0:2:47,39 --> 0:2:49,735
We sent a cameraman to accompany
him on this trip and


53
0:2:49,735 --> 0:2:52,55
made plans to meet up with
them once we arrived.

into the [INAUDIBLE].
