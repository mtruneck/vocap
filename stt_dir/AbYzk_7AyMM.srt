1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:30,24



2
0:0:30,24 --> 0:0:32,18
NOAH SALASNEK: I definitely
skateboarded before I ever


3
0:0:32,18 --> 0:0:33,13
snowboarded.


4
0:0:33,13 --> 0:0:35,33
I probably started skateboarding
when I was six


5
0:0:35,33 --> 0:0:36,64
years old, I believe.


6
0:0:36,64 --> 0:0:39,37
My older brother actually,
when I was young, was my


7
0:0:39,37 --> 0:0:40,96
mentor for skateboarding.


8
0:0:40,96 --> 0:0:45,5
But as I got older, and got into
it, and progressed, some


9
0:0:45,5 --> 0:0:48,78
of the prominent pros at the
time, obviously Tony Hawk, and


10
0:0:48,78 --> 0:0:51,2
some of the vert skaters,
as I was a vert


11
0:0:51,2 --> 0:0:52,88
skater at the time mainly.


12
0:0:52,88 --> 0:0:55,33
One of my first sponsors
was a shop sponsor,


13
0:0:55,33 --> 0:0:56,77
Marin Surf and Skate.


14
0:0:56,77 --> 0:0:59,46
And that kind of gave me a
stepping stone to enter some


15
0:0:59,46 --> 0:1:1,55
contests and get some
visibility.


16
0:1:1,55 --> 0:1:4,85
I started getting in magazines,
and traveling a


17
0:1:4,85 --> 0:1:7,155
little more, and I got picked
up by H-Street later on.


18
0:1:7,155 --> 0:1:9,54
Yeah, I was in a couple
different H-Street videos.


19
0:1:9,54 --> 0:1:12,13
The first one I was not in, I
think it was "Shackle Me Not"


20
0:1:12,13 --> 0:1:12,95
was the name of it.


21
0:1:12,95 --> 0:1:17,7
But that was the one that
got so much notoriety.


22
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:19,62
And then I got on H-Street and
I was in the following "Hokus


23
0:1:19,62 --> 0:1:22,2
Pokus" video the next year,
I believe, and had a


24
0:1:22,2 --> 0:1:23,64
good part in that.


25
0:1:23,64 --> 0:1:25,79
Mack Dawg had actually
got me on.


26
0:1:25,79 --> 0:1:27,57
I was friends with Mack
Dawg and he was


27
0:1:27,57 --> 0:1:28,915
making videos for H-Street.


28
0:1:28,915 --> 0:1:31,77
This was before the videos
were a big craze.


29
0:1:31,77 --> 0:1:33,93
The Bones Brigade videos were
like the only thing.


30
0:1:33,93 --> 0:1:36,33
So H-Street came out
with a great video


31
0:1:36,33 --> 0:1:38,23
inspired by Mack Dawg.


32
0:1:38,23 --> 0:1:40,62
And he actually got me on
the team and got me


33
0:1:40,62 --> 0:1:42,26
introduced to them.


34
0:1:42,26 --> 0:1:45,6
MIKE MCENTIRE: Well because
of "Sick Boys," Mike


35
0:1:45,6 --> 0:1:46,19
Ternasky saw that.


36
0:1:46,19 --> 0:1:47,5
He was pretty hyped on it.


37
0:1:47,5 --> 0:1:49,39
I think the main thing
he liked about it


38
0:1:49,39 --> 0:1:52,23
was the Super 8 filming.


39
0:1:52,23 --> 0:1:54,53
He didn't know much about film
and he wanted to have that


40
0:1:54,53 --> 0:1:58,56
look in "Hokus Pokus." So that
was the main reason why I got


41
0:1:58,56 --> 0:2:2,42
hired for that gig and it
worked out pretty well.


42
0:2:2,42 --> 0:2:3,6
NOAH SALASNEK: It's all history
there because I


43
0:2:3,6 --> 0:2:6,35
started shooting with Mack Dawg
with snowboarding too and


44
0:2:6,35 --> 0:2:8,9
kind of gave him a career, and
in return, he's helped my


45
0:2:8,9 --> 0:2:9,59
career too.


46
0:2:9,59 --> 0:2:11,72
So it's been pretty cool.


47
0:2:11,72 --> 0:2:14,56
The reason I turned pro was I
had just competed the year


48
0:2:14,56 --> 0:2:16,8
prior in three different events


49
0:2:16,8 --> 0:2:17,78
to get to the nationals.


50
0:2:17,78 --> 0:2:20,58
And I went there, qualified in
the street, and for the vert


51
0:2:20,58 --> 0:2:23,5
contest as well, which was
my forte, a vert skater.


52
0:2:23,5 --> 0:2:26,7
And I ended up winning a street
contest the day before


53
0:2:26,7 --> 0:2:27,12
the vert contest.


54
0:2:27,12 --> 0:2:28,86
And everyone was like, you're
going to turn pro.


55
0:2:28,86 --> 0:2:29,8
And I'm like, what
do you mean?


56
0:2:29,8 --> 0:2:32,28
They're like, dude, you won
the biggest event, amateur


57
0:2:32,28 --> 0:2:33,46
event, you're going
to get a board.


58
0:2:33,46 --> 0:2:34,2
I'm like, really?


59
0:2:34,2 --> 0:2:36,11
And I was like, I don't
know about that.


60
0:2:36,11 --> 0:2:38,41
And then I did horrible on the
vert contest because I was


61
0:2:38,41 --> 0:2:40,26
just stoked on that I won
the street thing.


62
0:2:40,26 --> 0:2:43,61
And sure enough, I did turn pro
and for a few years had my


63
0:2:43,61 --> 0:2:47,54
own board with H-Street and Life
Skateboards at the time.


64
0:2:47,54 --> 0:2:48,32
And I did pretty well.


65
0:2:48,32 --> 0:2:50,31
I wish I would've hung on to
that career a little more now


66
0:2:50,31 --> 0:2:52,4
that I look back and juggled
both, kind of


67
0:2:52,4 --> 0:2:53,3
like Shawn White does.


68
0:2:53,3 --> 0:2:55,655
I feel he's kind of a
new school of me.


69
0:2:55,655 --> 0:2:58,43
He's really powerful on vert,
and doing well in


70
0:2:58,43 --> 0:3:1,3
competitions, and killing in
snowboarding, obviously.


71
0:3:1,3 --> 0:3:4,33
So he's someone who has kind of
taken a step farther than


72
0:3:4,33 --> 0:3:6,11
what I did, I feel like.


73
0:3:6,11 --> 0:3:7,89
MIKE RANQUET: About the same
time I met him snowboarding


74
0:3:7,89 --> 0:3:10,64
through Roach, he was
already coming up in


75
0:3:10,64 --> 0:3:13,5
NorCal skate scene.


76
0:3:13,5 --> 0:3:16,88
And man, that guy
was so talented.


77
0:3:16,88 --> 0:3:19,8
And when you see someone on a
vert ramp that size do a 6


78
0:3:19,8 --> 0:3:22,25
foot ollie, like over
your head frontside


79
0:3:22,25 --> 0:3:26,1
ollies, it's like wow.


80
0:3:26,1 --> 0:3:30,3
And yeah, I knew if he got into
snowboarding, he would


81
0:3:30,3 --> 0:3:31,89
help change things.


82
0:3:31,89 --> 0:3:35,78
He was a much better
skater than me.


83
0:3:35,78 --> 0:3:36,7
He was a pro.


84
0:3:36,7 --> 0:3:39,84
He had a pro model deservedly,
not because he was like


85
0:3:39,84 --> 0:3:44,58
"snowboarder." It wasn't like
a token type thing.


86
0:3:44,58 --> 0:3:48,15
He was a legit gnarly
pro vert skater.


87
0:3:48,15 --> 0:3:49,78
NOAH SALASNEK: I guess it was
around a seven to eight year


88
0:3:49,78 --> 0:3:52,52
career that I had in
skateboarding before I


89
0:3:52,52 --> 0:3:56,32
actually stepped away and
focused more on snowboarding


90
0:3:56,32 --> 0:3:58,89
in my early 20s, I would say.


91
0:3:58,89 --> 0:4:0,95
And not that I let my stating
go, but definitely the


92
0:4:0,95 --> 0:4:2,44
competitive side I did.


93
0:4:2,44 --> 0:4:5,13
And I still skateboarded for
fun, but I really focused on


94
0:4:5,13 --> 0:4:9,6
the snow and made that my main
profession, I could say.


95
0:4:9,6 --> 0:4:12,4
So I think I started
snowboarding when I was 18.


96
0:4:12,4 --> 0:4:14,82
And it was kind of a cross
between my skiing and my


97
0:4:14,82 --> 0:4:15,165
skateboarding.


98
0:4:15,165 --> 0:4:18,22
I was like, wow, snowboarding
looks so cool to me.


99
0:4:18,22 --> 0:4:20,5
And so I got into it way
later than actually


100
0:4:20,5 --> 0:4:22,42
skating, for sure.


101
0:4:22,42 --> 0:4:24,57
CHRIS ROACH: Yeah, when I first
met him he was already a


102
0:4:24,57 --> 0:4:25,425
professional skateboarder.


103
0:4:25,425 --> 0:4:30,4
I think him and AV were both
professional and they were


104
0:4:30,4 --> 0:4:32,34
just getting into
snowboarding.


105
0:4:32,34 --> 0:4:35,95
And once I saw them skating,
I was like, holy.


106
0:4:35,95 --> 0:4:39,2
They were already
ripping skaters.


107
0:4:39,2 --> 0:4:42,22
If we went somewhere together,
I could watch them skate and


108
0:4:42,22 --> 0:4:43,315
try to learn from them.


109
0:4:43,315 --> 0:4:48,8
And it was nice not to be the
only one around having that.


110
0:4:48,8 --> 0:4:51,81
And they were pushing
snowboarding like they were


111
0:4:51,81 --> 0:4:53,81
skateboarding.


112
0:4:53,81 --> 0:4:55,71
NOAH SALASNEK: When I started
snowboarding, I saw people


113
0:4:55,71 --> 0:5:0,7
like Chris and a few other pro
snowboarders on the hill when


114
0:5:0,7 --> 0:5:1,56
I was actually learning,
I guess.


115
0:5:1,56 --> 0:5:4,89
And this was probably in the,
I don't know, late '80s.


116
0:5:4,89 --> 0:5:7,84
And I saw people like Chris just
ripping down the hill.


117
0:5:7,84 --> 0:5:9,61
And I was like, wow, these
guys are really good.


118
0:5:9,61 --> 0:5:12,46
And it just kind of motivated
me to ride more and


119
0:5:12,46 --> 0:5:14,61
aspire to be that.


120
0:5:14,61 --> 0:5:16,45
MIKE RANQUET: Noah has a lot
more to do with things than


121
0:5:16,45 --> 0:5:18,94
maybe people know or maybe
even he knows.


122
0:5:18,94 --> 0:5:21,41
Noah with Mack Dawg for
sure helped turn


123
0:5:21,41 --> 0:5:25,91
that tide, like 100%.


124
0:5:25,91 --> 0:5:28,9
BRAD KREMER: I think in "Hokus
Pokus" there was a couple


125
0:5:28,9 --> 0:5:29,47
snowboarding shots of Noah.


126
0:5:29,47 --> 0:5:33,345
And Dawger just was totally
against the whole snowboard


127
0:5:33,345 --> 0:5:34,55
scene and stuff.


128
0:5:34,55 --> 0:5:37,27
MIKE MCENTIRE: Well,
snowboarding was pretty


129
0:5:37,27 --> 0:5:38,71
hurting, I thought.


130
0:5:38,71 --> 0:5:41,33
And it actually was
pretty harsh.


131
0:5:41,33 --> 0:5:46,1
Like early snowboarding, guys
didn't really understand


132
0:5:46,1 --> 0:5:47,92
anything about style at all.


133
0:5:47,92 --> 0:5:50,86
There was a few people that did,
like Terry Kidwell and


134
0:5:50,86 --> 0:5:53,62
Craig Kelly, and they were
like doing it right.


135
0:5:53,62 --> 0:5:56,315
But for the most part, your
average people that you would


136
0:5:56,315 --> 0:5:57,42
see, they'd just suck.


137
0:5:57,42 --> 0:5:59,77
Man, I can't even describe
how lame it looked.


138
0:5:59,77 --> 0:6:1,2
I was over it.


139
0:6:1,2 --> 0:6:3,66
We went up there and there was
all these dudes in hard boots


140
0:6:3,66 --> 0:6:7,5
and tights basically,
like Day-Glo stuff.


141
0:6:7,5 --> 0:6:10,19
And it just looked so stupid.


142
0:6:10,19 --> 0:6:13,44
And I was filming skating, like
Danny Way, and Hensley,


143
0:6:13,44 --> 0:6:15,26
and Noah, and those
guys, and all the


144
0:6:15,26 --> 0:6:17,14
CBS guys in San Francisco.


145
0:6:17,14 --> 0:6:20,85
Like the contrast between those
snowboarder dudes that I


146
0:6:20,85 --> 0:6:24,26
saw and stating, I just
thought it was stupid.


147
0:6:24,26 --> 0:6:26,82



148
0:6:26,82 --> 0:6:29,89
Anyways, Noah wanted that shot,
so we went and got it.


149
0:6:29,89 --> 0:6:32,9
But then I started snowboarding
with him and I


150
0:6:32,9 --> 0:6:33,49
enjoyed it a lot.


151
0:6:33,49 --> 0:6:35,84
And then him and Roach were
going off doing stuff.


152
0:6:35,84 --> 0:6:37,99
And they made snowboarding
look good.


153
0:6:37,99 --> 0:6:40,65
So that's why I started
shooting it.


154
0:6:40,65 --> 0:6:42,26
CHRIS ROACH: When we were riding
together, like every


155
0:6:42,26 --> 0:6:44,54
day it was something new.


156
0:6:44,54 --> 0:6:47,3
Every single day we were
changing what was going to


157
0:6:47,3 --> 0:6:48,7
happen with snowboarding.


158
0:6:48,7 --> 0:6:50,755
And I remember those two years,
or whatever was going


159
0:6:50,755 --> 0:6:53,31
on when we were doing that, that
snowboarding was going


160
0:6:53,31 --> 0:6:54,31
into a new direction.


161
0:6:54,31 --> 0:6:55,74
And it was nice to be
a part of that.


162
0:6:55,74 --> 0:6:58,62
And I think Noah was one of
the guys who was in the


163
0:6:58,62 --> 0:6:59,33
forefront of that.


164
0:6:59,33 --> 0:7:2,31
And there would be no stopping
it at that point.


165
0:7:2,31 --> 0:7:3,54
SHAWN FARMER: I don't know what
it was with those two,


166
0:7:3,54 --> 0:7:5,59
but it was obvious--


167
0:7:5,59 --> 0:7:8,99
I still feel like that whole
look still came from Terry


168
0:7:8,99 --> 0:7:13,73
Kidwell, and like Palmer, and
then Craig Kelly, and Roach


169
0:7:13,73 --> 0:7:15,4
was always there
too, and Salas.


170
0:7:15,4 --> 0:7:18,72
But I don't even see it
today really, hardly.


171
0:7:18,72 --> 0:7:20,13
You just don't see it.


172
0:7:20,13 --> 0:7:23,59
It was just like I don't know
why those dudes got it and


173
0:7:23,59 --> 0:7:24,75
like a lot of people didn't.


174
0:7:24,75 --> 0:7:26,84
But it was really
cool looking.


175
0:7:26,84 --> 0:7:28,37
They like rode together.


176
0:7:28,37 --> 0:7:32,75
That was part of why they
are the way they are.


177
0:7:32,75 --> 0:7:37,86
JAMIE LYNN: Noah had more of
like a technicality to him and


178
0:7:37,86 --> 0:7:43,23
did more spin-oriented tricks
where Chris would kick out a


179
0:7:43,23 --> 0:7:48,81
big grasser and Noah would
do like a backside seven.


180
0:7:48,81 --> 0:7:53,3
Both sick, equally impressive
tricks, but just you could


181
0:7:53,3 --> 0:7:55,35
tell that one was kind of a
technician and the other one


182
0:7:55,35 --> 0:8:1,6
was kind of like laid back and
cruising, but also on point.


183
0:8:1,6 --> 0:8:2,625
NOAH SALASNEK: No, if anything
he was more proficient.


184
0:8:2,625 --> 0:8:3,95
He was the better rider.


185
0:8:3,95 --> 0:8:6,97
I was trying to aspire to
be calmer like he is.


186
0:8:6,97 --> 0:8:8,21
He's really calm on his board.


187
0:8:8,21 --> 0:8:11,13
And I think I had that arm
movement that's so famous.


188
0:8:11,13 --> 0:8:13,5
God, I don't know where
that came from.


189
0:8:13,5 --> 0:8:14,71
But, yeah, I lost that.


190
0:8:14,71 --> 0:8:16,88
And part of that I can
contribute to Roach.


191
0:8:16,88 --> 0:8:19,96
A calm style, he's always had
that, and very fluid.


192
0:8:19,96 --> 0:8:22,94
And I think I developed my style
more over the years,


193
0:8:22,94 --> 0:8:26,14
whereas he actually just had
style, just hands down.


194
0:8:26,14 --> 0:8:28,44
People might have said I have,
but I think that I worked on


195
0:8:28,44 --> 0:8:29,99
it a little more,
I worked for it.


196
0:8:29,99 --> 0:8:32,0
They either say you have
style or you don't.


197
0:8:32,0 --> 0:8:34,404
You can work at it a little bit
and get some style if you


198
0:8:34,404 --> 0:8:36,9
ride it enough.


199
0:8:36,9 --> 0:8:38,669
CHRIS ROACH: I don't think our
styles were mimicking each


200
0:8:38,669 --> 0:8:39,14
other at all.


201
0:8:39,14 --> 0:8:44,2
I think if you look at it, we
don't ride alike at all, but


202
0:8:44,2 --> 0:8:49,9
we did a lot of the same tricks
and stuff because we


203
0:8:49,9 --> 0:8:50,25
fucking hung out every day.


204
0:8:50,25 --> 0:8:55,87
And it was like, that was sick,
how about I try it?


205
0:8:55,87 --> 0:8:58,34
JP WALKER: He was one of the
first guys that I was super


206
0:8:58,34 --> 0:8:59,37
hyped on in snowboarding.


207
0:8:59,37 --> 0:9:3,25
Like the first video I ever saw
was "Critical Condition"


208
0:9:3,25 --> 0:9:7,19
and he had like a really sick
part in that video.


209
0:9:7,19 --> 0:9:9,35
It wasn't like a part, but
he was like in the video.


210
0:9:9,35 --> 0:9:13,22
And he was, I felt, one of the
guys that just kind of have


211
0:9:13,22 --> 0:9:14,96
like a sick style.


212
0:9:14,96 --> 0:9:17,2
Like Chris Roach is in the video
too, but he didn't have


213
0:9:17,2 --> 0:9:19,25
much footage in it because
he got hurt.


214
0:9:19,25 --> 0:9:22,11
And I was just stoked
on Salasnek's style.


215
0:9:22,11 --> 0:9:24,91
I mean I had long blonde
hair and a goatee.


216
0:9:24,91 --> 0:9:27,93
I looked just like him besides
maybe a dip in the mouth.


217
0:9:27,93 --> 0:9:31,48
Like I totally tried to model
myself after him for so long.


218
0:9:31,48 --> 0:9:34,32
NOAH SALASNEK: Well, I think
with Mack Dawg, growing up I


219
0:9:34,32 --> 0:9:35,7
had a relationship with him.


220
0:9:35,7 --> 0:9:37,33
We got along really well.


221
0:9:37,33 --> 0:9:40,21
So I'd say he was the easiest
best person to film with.


222
0:9:40,21 --> 0:9:43,42
And then with snowboarding, I
met Faultline Films and they


223
0:9:43,42 --> 0:9:45,35
were pretty cool people,
I'd have to say.


224
0:9:45,35 --> 0:9:48,19
They were my first real
snowboard film company that I


225
0:9:48,19 --> 0:9:49,74
worked with legitimate.


226
0:9:49,74 --> 0:9:52,53
Got some recognition
one year on that.


227
0:9:52,53 --> 0:9:54,425
I had this offer from H-Street
to make a snowboard.


228
0:9:54,425 --> 0:9:55,75
And I said, hey, let's do one.


229
0:9:55,75 --> 0:9:57,3
They put my name on a board.


230
0:9:57,3 --> 0:9:59,67
And unfortunately, one of the
owners had got in an accident


231
0:9:59,67 --> 0:10:0,86
and passed away.


232
0:10:0,86 --> 0:10:2,87
And the other owner of H-Street
did not want anything


233
0:10:2,87 --> 0:10:5,93
to do with snowboarding and I
was kind of left in limbo.


234
0:10:5,93 --> 0:10:8,66
And I ended up going to a trade
show with a resume and


235
0:10:8,66 --> 0:10:10,56
going to Tom Sims
in the booth.


236
0:10:10,56 --> 0:10:12,97
And they had new backers
and kind of worked


237
0:10:12,97 --> 0:10:13,8
out a deal with them.


238
0:10:13,8 --> 0:10:15,31
It was kind of a good
timing type thing.


239
0:10:15,31 --> 0:10:17,85
But yeah, it was unfortunate
because I think H-Street could


240
0:10:17,85 --> 0:10:20,22
have done something in
snowboarding had


241
0:10:20,22 --> 0:10:21,3
Mike Ternasky lived.


242
0:10:21,3 --> 0:10:26,26
But anyway, it was sad and it
was unfortunate, but I did


243
0:10:26,26 --> 0:10:28,74
work it out with Sims and
ride for them for


244
0:10:28,74 --> 0:10:30,2
seven or eight years.


245
0:10:30,2 --> 0:10:33,48
TOM SIMS: I mean Noah was just
a really easygoing, likable


246
0:10:33,48 --> 0:10:40,5
guy, and you couldn't help
but like the guy.


247
0:10:40,5 --> 0:10:43,83
He was so low-key that when
you did seem him in a


248
0:10:43,83 --> 0:10:47,82
half-pipe competition, you're
almost like, gosh, it almost


249
0:10:47,82 --> 0:10:51,19
seems like it's a different
guy because he was so


250
0:10:51,19 --> 0:10:54,24
technically advanced
on his tricks.


251
0:10:54,24 --> 0:10:57,35
The other snowboarders could
appreciate what Noah was doing


252
0:10:57,35 --> 0:10:59,72
and quite often the
judges didn't.


253
0:10:59,72 --> 0:11:2,18
CHRIS ROACH: I think what
set Noah and I apart


254
0:11:2,18 --> 0:11:6,61
was that, for me--


255
0:11:6,61 --> 0:11:9,4
I mean I gave a shit, I did
contests and stuff, but I


256
0:11:9,4 --> 0:11:10,49
never did well in them.


257
0:11:10,49 --> 0:11:14,3
And Noah would go in there and
his head was always together.


258
0:11:14,3 --> 0:11:15,58
He always did well
in contests.


259
0:11:15,58 --> 0:11:18,0
I mean, he could go to any
contest and, fuck, he was


260
0:11:18,0 --> 0:11:20,1
going to be top three
no matter what.


261
0:11:20,1 --> 0:11:23,32
I'd go there and even if we
are the same rider and I


262
0:11:23,32 --> 0:11:25,57
should be up there, I'd get
fucking 10th and be like,


263
0:11:25,57 --> 0:11:26,84
yeah, I got 10th.


264
0:11:26,84 --> 0:11:28,37
And he wasn't stoked, man.


265
0:11:28,37 --> 0:11:29,6
He wanted to win everything.


266
0:11:29,6 --> 0:11:30,7
And that's cool, man.


267
0:11:30,7 --> 0:11:32,94
He had a lot of heart
and passion for it.


268
0:11:32,94 --> 0:11:36,32
CIRCE WALLACE: I feel like
Noah took it farther.


269
0:11:36,32 --> 0:11:40,58
I think Noah was technically
more capable.


270
0:11:40,58 --> 0:11:46,42
Chris really, he was a little
bit of an underachiever, where


271
0:11:46,42 --> 0:11:48,73
Noah wasn't.


272
0:11:48,73 --> 0:11:50,6
He wanted it all the way.


273
0:11:50,6 --> 0:11:53,392
And yeah, I think he
made more money.


274
0:11:53,392 --> 0:11:55,66
NOAH SALASNEK: Just after riding
for Sims for the first


275
0:11:55,66 --> 0:11:58,18
year, and getting the response
we had, and having a pro


276
0:11:58,18 --> 0:12:2,2
model, and coming into money
being young, and just being so


277
0:12:2,2 --> 0:12:4,61
adamant about my career and
snowboarding at the time, I


278
0:12:4,61 --> 0:12:5,84
just focused on that.


279
0:12:5,84 --> 0:12:8,68
I bought a house in Tahoe and
really when after it.


280
0:12:8,68 --> 0:12:12,4
I made that decision, my
professional career to be a


281
0:12:12,4 --> 0:12:13,0
snowboarding.


282
0:12:13,0 --> 0:12:15,21
And financially it worked
out at the time and so


283
0:12:15,21 --> 0:12:16,63
I stuck with it.


284
0:12:16,63 --> 0:12:19,25
TOM SIMS: The Noah Salasnek
board when we first came out


285
0:12:19,25 --> 0:12:22,17
with it was one of the
most progressive


286
0:12:22,17 --> 0:12:24,12
snowboards we ever made.


287
0:12:24,12 --> 0:12:26,33
And it was so cool.


288
0:12:26,33 --> 0:12:27,84
One of the ones had
a skateboard


289
0:12:27,84 --> 0:12:29,19
graphic on the bottom.


290
0:12:29,19 --> 0:12:33,51
It just showed that so many of
the Sims team riders had solid


291
0:12:33,51 --> 0:12:35,7
skateboarding backgrounds.


292
0:12:35,7 --> 0:12:38,4
And I had a skateboarding
background before I got into


293
0:12:38,4 --> 0:12:39,21
snowboarding.


294
0:12:39,21 --> 0:12:44,16
And so, that connection
was very much a part


295
0:12:44,16 --> 0:12:45,45
of what Sims was.


296
0:12:45,45 --> 0:12:47,32
NOAH SALASNEK: Well my first
graphic with Sims, I had


297
0:12:47,32 --> 0:12:50,3
always wanted to do like
a skateboard base.


298
0:12:50,3 --> 0:12:51,4
And that's what we
ended up doing.


299
0:12:51,4 --> 0:12:53,25
The top sheet was kind
of totally unrelated.


300
0:12:53,25 --> 0:12:55,955
It had kind of like
a hobo with a dog.


301
0:12:55,955 --> 0:12:57,995
It kind of looked like
me, I suppose, with


302
0:12:57,995 --> 0:12:58,97
the goatee and stuff.


303
0:12:58,97 --> 0:13:3,76
But nonetheless, the base had
the independent looking trucks


304
0:13:3,76 --> 0:13:4,76
and wheels and stuff.


305
0:13:4,76 --> 0:13:6,3
So that was my idea then.


306
0:13:6,3 --> 0:13:8,29
And that board did pretty
well, actually.


307
0:13:8,29 --> 0:13:10,83
And it's funny because Hetzel
came out with one even though


308
0:13:10,83 --> 0:13:11,84
he heard that I had done that.


309
0:13:11,84 --> 0:13:14,63
And he did it, I think, the same
year even though he knew


310
0:13:14,63 --> 0:13:15,9
that I had done that,
which I don't know


311
0:13:15,9 --> 0:13:16,62
why he would do that.


312
0:13:16,62 --> 0:13:19,7
But whatever, I don't think he
sold half as many boards as I


313
0:13:19,7 --> 0:13:20,33
did that year.


314
0:13:20,33 --> 0:13:21,885
So what do I care?


315
0:13:21,885 --> 0:13:23,75
I'm just playing, I'm
friends with Hetzel.


316
0:13:23,75 --> 0:13:25,105
But that was pretty funny.


317
0:13:25,105 --> 0:13:27,63
I think Palmer was the one who
told him he should do it.


318
0:13:27,63 --> 0:13:30,14
Because Palmer was pissed that
I got on Sims and I'm getting


319
0:13:30,14 --> 0:13:31,11
a board right away.


320
0:13:31,11 --> 0:13:32,84
He's ridden for them for
years and now he's


321
0:13:32,84 --> 0:13:34,89
getting his first board.


322
0:13:34,89 --> 0:13:37,76
So he's like Hetz, make your
skateboard base, that's cool.


323
0:13:37,76 --> 0:13:39,43
Noah, do it too.


324
0:13:39,43 --> 0:13:42,4
So he thought he'd get the last
laugh, but my board did


325
0:13:42,4 --> 0:13:44,34
well that year, so
that was cool.


326
0:13:44,34 --> 0:13:47,2
KEVIN ENGLISH: It's funny, I
forget what Standard movie it


327
0:13:47,2 --> 0:13:48,77
is with Salasnek.


328
0:13:48,77 --> 0:13:51,64
There's like a part where he's
riding an old Sims board, I


329
0:13:51,64 --> 0:13:53,55
don't know what it was, like
Sims half-pipe or something,


330
0:13:53,55 --> 0:13:56,46
where he's kind of
wearing like the


331
0:13:56,46 --> 0:13:58,6
color-blocked pants and stuff.


332
0:13:58,6 --> 0:14:1,67
It was also the year that
he came out with his


333
0:14:1,67 --> 0:14:3,9
skateboard pro model.


334
0:14:3,9 --> 0:14:5,7
So half the shots he was the
little character that was on


335
0:14:5,7 --> 0:14:8,4
his boards and then the other
shots he was kind of like the


336
0:14:8,4 --> 0:14:10,22
late '80s snowboarder guy.


337
0:14:10,22 --> 0:14:11,66
But it was like his
season was mixed.


338
0:14:11,66 --> 0:14:14,16
I don't know how that really
went down, but you could


339
0:14:14,16 --> 0:14:17,25
definitely see a distinct style
change right there.


340
0:14:17,25 --> 0:14:21,58
And then I think snowboarding
kind of followed Noah with it.


341
0:14:21,58 --> 0:14:24,14
NOAH SALASNEK: I think working
with Standard and having that


342
0:14:24,14 --> 0:14:27,45
"TB 2" part come out was one
of my better parts and


343
0:14:27,45 --> 0:14:30,72
definitely gave me a good push
and motivated me to film with


344
0:14:30,72 --> 0:14:34,48
them further for "TB 3" and "4."
But yeah, I think it was


345
0:14:34,48 --> 0:14:35,41
one of my better parts.


346
0:14:35,41 --> 0:14:37,1
And I think it was, again,
good timing.


347
0:14:37,1 --> 0:14:41,94
The time it came out was kind
of early back in the day.


348
0:14:41,94 --> 0:14:44,29
Yeah, I'm proud of that
part, absolutely.


349
0:14:44,29 --> 0:14:45,96
MIKE HATCHETT: When we picked
a crew for "TB 2," it was


350
0:14:45,96 --> 0:14:50,0
basically just a combination of
my brother and I and Mack


351
0:14:50,0 --> 0:14:53,93
Dawg sitting down and saying,
who's the best 10 or 12 guys


352
0:14:53,93 --> 0:14:55,13
we want to shoot?


353
0:14:55,13 --> 0:14:56,47
Noah was my bro from Tahoe.


354
0:14:56,47 --> 0:14:58,41
We knew he ripped and was
potentially one of the best


355
0:14:58,41 --> 0:14:59,22
guys in the world.


356
0:14:59,22 --> 0:15:1,21
And then there was the whole big
mountain guys that I was


357
0:15:1,21 --> 0:15:2,34
more friends with.


358
0:15:2,34 --> 0:15:4,36
So it was a combination of
Mack Dawg's freestyle


359
0:15:4,36 --> 0:15:6,48
background and him picking
those guys and having the


360
0:15:6,48 --> 0:15:9,59
connections, and then me being
connected with my brother and


361
0:15:9,59 --> 0:15:12,29
the big mountain scene, and
just kind of shuffling the


362
0:15:12,29 --> 0:15:15,42
deck and going here's the hand
we want to play right here.


363
0:15:15,42 --> 0:15:17,16
And some of it came to do
with Faultline too.


364
0:15:17,16 --> 0:15:19,27
Some of the guys who worked with
Faultline for years were


365
0:15:19,27 --> 0:15:20,58
getting a little fed up
with it and wanted


366
0:15:20,58 --> 0:15:21,95
to go in a new direction.


367
0:15:21,95 --> 0:15:23,88
So the timing was good for us.


368
0:15:23,88 --> 0:15:26,53
For Noah and Terrier, those
guys just wanted to try


369
0:15:26,53 --> 0:15:27,81
something new.


370
0:15:27,81 --> 0:15:30,12
So when they heard that Mack
Dawg and I want to go out on


371
0:15:30,12 --> 0:15:32,565
our own, they were all pretty
stoked because I think they


372
0:15:32,565 --> 0:15:34,75
had realized the vision.


373
0:15:34,75 --> 0:15:36,83
MIKE MCENTIRE: As a filmmaker
back then, I wasn't interested


374
0:15:36,83 --> 0:15:40,17
in filming anyone snowboarding
until they had learned a bunch


375
0:15:40,17 --> 0:15:41,62
of new stuff every year.


376
0:15:41,62 --> 0:15:43,36
So what did mean for us?


377
0:15:43,36 --> 0:15:45,16
Well, at the beginning of the
year we're riding powder every


378
0:15:45,16 --> 0:15:47,6
day while everyone's learning
their stuff.


379
0:15:47,6 --> 0:15:49,22
I didn't even start filming
until spring.


380
0:15:49,22 --> 0:15:51,99
So I had met up with the
Hatchetts in Squaw and just


381
0:15:51,99 --> 0:15:53,13
riding with them stuff.


382
0:15:53,13 --> 0:15:56,26
And I know Mike was pretty
frustrated about his situation


383
0:15:56,26 --> 0:15:57,5
over at Faultline.


384
0:15:57,5 --> 0:15:58,71
And he was hitting me up.


385
0:15:58,71 --> 0:16:1,23
I was making these pretty
low-budget films.


386
0:16:1,23 --> 0:16:4,11
He was like, why don't you get
a 16 millimeter camera and


387
0:16:4,11 --> 0:16:5,1
let's do this, dude.


388
0:16:5,1 --> 0:16:7,23
And I thought about
it and I wanted to


389
0:16:7,23 --> 0:16:10,33
move up into 16 anyways.


390
0:16:10,33 --> 0:16:12,52
Because I was just shooting
Super 8 and Hi8 and stuff.


391
0:16:12,52 --> 0:16:18,72
And so I got a camera, like a
1960 Airflex of this super old


392
0:16:18,72 --> 0:16:19,98
guy who used it maybe once.


393
0:16:19,98 --> 0:16:21,275
It was like brand new.


394
0:16:21,275 --> 0:16:24,905
And then I got out there and
we started doing our thing.


395
0:16:24,905 --> 0:16:26,46
We made Standard Films.


396
0:16:26,46 --> 0:16:28,85
And I came up with the name when
I was taking a leak at


397
0:16:28,85 --> 0:16:30,19
some gas station.


398
0:16:30,19 --> 0:16:32,37
There was a Standard
urinal there.


399
0:16:32,37 --> 0:16:35,26
And I'm like, sick, Standard.


400
0:16:35,26 --> 0:16:37,8
So that was how I came
up with that name.


401
0:16:37,8 --> 0:16:39,275
And it was a lot of fun, man.


402
0:16:39,275 --> 0:16:42,8
There was a good time in
snowboarding back then, a lot


403
0:16:42,8 --> 0:16:42,86
of progression.


404
0:16:42,86 --> 0:16:46,23
And it was super easy back
then because nothing


405
0:16:46,23 --> 0:16:47,25
much had been done.


406
0:16:47,25 --> 0:16:48,515
So it was good stuff.


407
0:16:48,515 --> 0:16:50,58
NOAH SALASNEK: The only
difference is Standard is


408
0:16:50,58 --> 0:16:53,55
going to meet at 5:00 AM at the
gas station and Artie and


409
0:16:53,55 --> 0:16:55,31
them might meet you at 9:15.


410
0:16:55,31 --> 0:16:57,29
So you get to sleep in a
little more when you're


411
0:16:57,29 --> 0:16:58,16
working with Faultline maybe.


412
0:16:58,16 --> 0:17:2,27
But other than that, they're
both professional on site and


413
0:17:2,27 --> 0:17:4,54
they're both motivated,
dedicated, good filmers.


414
0:17:4,54 --> 0:17:5,76
You know you're going
to get the shot.


415
0:17:5,76 --> 0:17:7,109
That's why I like filming
with them.


416
0:17:7,109 --> 0:17:10,15
If I'm going to go risk my life
or hike some peak and do


417
0:17:10,15 --> 0:17:12,91
some line, I want to guarantee
that it gets in the can, and


418
0:17:12,91 --> 0:17:14,65
you can get that working
with people like that,


419
0:17:14,65 --> 0:17:15,92
professionals.


420
0:17:15,92 --> 0:17:18,2
MIKE HATCHETT: I guess what Mack
Dawg and I and my brother


421
0:17:18,2 --> 0:17:20,45
wanted to prove is we wanted
to make the best snowboard


422
0:17:20,45 --> 0:17:22,6
video that ever had been made.


423
0:17:22,6 --> 0:17:26,28
And I don't want to say that
sounding arrogantly or cocky


424
0:17:26,28 --> 0:17:29,36
in any way, but we just thought
that the movies that


425
0:17:29,36 --> 0:17:32,22
were out there were good,
but they weren't great.


426
0:17:32,22 --> 0:17:35,13
We wanted to focus on just
snowboarding itself and the


427
0:17:35,13 --> 0:17:37,9
characters, the riders,
themselves and not so much of


428
0:17:37,9 --> 0:17:40,13
the storytelling
and narration.


429
0:17:40,13 --> 0:17:42,68
We were over the Faultline
narration, we went here, and


430
0:17:42,68 --> 0:17:43,86
we did this, and we did that.


431
0:17:43,86 --> 0:17:46,385
And again, not to dis on Jerry
and Artie because Faultline is


432
0:17:46,385 --> 0:17:49,48
a great film company, and the
contribution they made in


433
0:17:49,48 --> 0:17:50,64
snowboarding was amazing.


434
0:17:50,64 --> 0:17:53,125
But yeah, we wanted to get away
from that and more just


435
0:17:53,125 --> 0:17:56,28
like this is dope snowboarding,
here's some good


436
0:17:56,28 --> 0:17:59,739
music, here's Noah Salasnek,
watch him rip.


437
0:17:59,739 --> 0:18:22,7
[PUNK MUSIC PLAYING]


438
0:18:22,7 --> 0:18:24,42
NOAH SALASNEK: I think there
was a cool shot of Granite


439
0:18:24,42 --> 0:18:27,74
Chief Peak where I do like two
turns and pop like a 30, 40


440
0:18:27,74 --> 0:18:30,78
foot cliff maybe max, and land
it pretty good, and do a


441
0:18:30,78 --> 0:18:31,78
couple turns out.


442
0:18:31,78 --> 0:18:33,37
And I was on like a race board,
but no one probably


443
0:18:33,37 --> 0:18:35,35
knows, like a 170.


444
0:18:35,35 --> 0:18:36,73
But it was pretty cool
because I was able


445
0:18:36,73 --> 0:18:37,65
to stomp the landing.


446
0:18:37,65 --> 0:18:40,12
But what they don't know, or
maybe it's in the slam


447
0:18:40,12 --> 0:18:42,75
section, I went back up and
tried it again and ended up


448
0:18:42,75 --> 0:18:45,7
tumbling and just tomahawking
at like 30 miles an hour.


449
0:18:45,7 --> 0:18:47,35
It was one of my worst
beat-downs.


450
0:18:47,35 --> 0:18:49,19
I think it did make the slam
section, actually.


451
0:18:49,19 --> 0:18:53,39
But when I stomped it was pretty
rewarding for sure.


452
0:18:53,39 --> 0:18:55,31
So that stands out in my mind


453
0:18:55,31 --> 0:18:58,38
JEREMY JONES: Noah's was the
first style that really kind


454
0:18:58,38 --> 0:18:59,56
of drew me in.


455
0:18:59,56 --> 0:19:3,4
And that's when it was really
like, oh, I get it now.


456
0:19:3,4 --> 0:19:7,74
Because before it was Damian in
hard boots like going down


457
0:19:7,74 --> 0:19:10,59
the fingers at Tahoe or getting
dropped off in a


458
0:19:10,59 --> 0:19:11,47
helicopter.


459
0:19:11,47 --> 0:19:16,45
And to me as a kid, it was
something that was just what


460
0:19:16,45 --> 0:19:17,67
those guys did.


461
0:19:17,67 --> 0:19:21,61
It was nothing I could
ever imagine doing.


462
0:19:21,61 --> 0:19:26,42
And then when these other guys
went to that level, I could


463
0:19:26,42 --> 0:19:28,18
grasp that and it made sense.


464
0:19:28,18 --> 0:19:31,62
And then all a sudden, it was me
and my buddies, like we're


465
0:19:31,62 --> 0:19:37,55
doing what they're doing, and
we could do this one day.


466
0:19:37,55 --> 0:19:40,15
JP WALKER: Maybe the year
before, like somebody did like


467
0:19:40,15 --> 0:19:41,46
a late backside 180.


468
0:19:41,46 --> 0:19:44,2
And then Noah's part came out
the year later and had like


469
0:19:44,2 --> 0:19:47,66
late switch backside 3's and
all this crazy stuff.


470
0:19:47,66 --> 0:19:50,44
So I was all about that
and doing butters.


471
0:19:50,44 --> 0:19:54,45
Like butters was just like the
only thing for a while that


472
0:19:54,45 --> 0:19:58,38
mattered, just butter from the
top of the lift to the bottom.


473
0:19:58,38 --> 0:19:59,81
And he was super good at it.


474
0:19:59,81 --> 0:20:4,5
And it was sick because I
remember he had like shots


475
0:20:4,5 --> 0:20:7,731
where he'd butter up to cornices
and spin off of them


476
0:20:7,731 --> 0:20:9,77
and all kinds of stuff
like that.


477
0:20:9,77 --> 0:20:14,59
So I was just like goateed
up and buttering it up.


478
0:20:14,59 --> 0:20:16,24
NOAH SALASNEK: I don't know who
started the whole little


479
0:20:16,24 --> 0:20:16,88
butter thing.


480
0:20:16,88 --> 0:20:19,53
I know we got kind of into the
nose pressing and tail


481
0:20:19,53 --> 0:20:21,49
pressing and trying
blunt slides or


482
0:20:21,49 --> 0:20:22,5
whatever they're called.


483
0:20:22,5 --> 0:20:24,59
I mean everyone's got a
different name for them.


484
0:20:24,59 --> 0:20:26,51
But yeah, there was a little
era everyone went through.


485
0:20:26,51 --> 0:20:30,17
They were trying to press the
nose and spin out of this and


486
0:20:30,17 --> 0:20:31,76
that and went through
a little phase.


487
0:20:31,76 --> 0:20:32,51
But it's pretty cool.


488
0:20:32,51 --> 0:20:35,3
I've been known to sit back on
my tail and snap a 180 out of


489
0:20:35,3 --> 0:20:36,5
it now and again.


490
0:20:36,5 --> 0:20:39,33
So it's still pretty fun to
dabble in, little nose press


491
0:20:39,33 --> 0:20:40,96
or butters or whatever.


492
0:20:40,96 --> 0:20:43,14
MIKE HATCHETT: And kind of
what's cool about filming back


493
0:20:43,14 --> 0:20:48,67
"TB 2," "3," "4," there wasn't
like today it's almost, OK,


494
0:20:48,67 --> 0:20:51,37
we're going to go to this
knoll and build this gap


495
0:20:51,37 --> 0:20:53,11
that's been filmed 20
gazillion times.


496
0:20:53,11 --> 0:20:55,2
We're going to hit this log, or
I'm going to back lip this


497
0:20:55,2 --> 0:20:57,46
rail, or I'm going to do a front
side through this kink,


498
0:20:57,46 --> 0:21:1,6
or I'm going to do a switch
back 1260, whatever.


499
0:21:1,6 --> 0:21:4,46
You're going to do this trick
and it's a set-up shot.


500
0:21:4,46 --> 0:21:8,19
You're sitting sideways, you
point it, you do your trick,


501
0:21:8,19 --> 0:21:12,43
you land just far enough for
the shot, and you're done.


502
0:21:12,43 --> 0:21:14,66
We'd just go out and look up
at something and go, let's


503
0:21:14,66 --> 0:21:16,73
just ride it, let's
just film that.


504
0:21:16,73 --> 0:21:20,96
Watch Noah's part from "TB 4,"
his opening shot, you can just


505
0:21:20,96 --> 0:21:23,54
see the spontaneous riding
in that shot.


506
0:21:23,54 --> 0:21:27,62
It's just slashing front 3's.


507
0:21:27,62 --> 0:21:28,48
He just cruised it.


508
0:21:28,48 --> 0:21:31,135
JP WALKER: The one thing that
stood out to me was he had


509
0:21:31,135 --> 0:21:33,15
this backside 720 tail grab.


510
0:21:33,15 --> 0:21:37,13
I think it was like somewhere
in Tahoe, like a spot, maybe


511
0:21:37,13 --> 0:21:38,74
it was like at Mount Rose or
something, it was like a


512
0:21:38,74 --> 0:21:39,92
cornice gap thing.


513
0:21:39,92 --> 0:21:46,42
And it was just like the best
backside 720 to ever go down,


514
0:21:46,42 --> 0:21:48,72
I felt like, in the history
of snowboarding.


515
0:21:48,72 --> 0:21:54,25
I remember it was just like so
good, and tail grab, and I was


516
0:21:54,25 --> 0:21:55,59
pretty hyped on that.


517
0:21:55,59 --> 0:21:58,51
SHAWN FARMER: I mean Salasnek
for a while was just crushing


518
0:21:58,51 --> 0:22:2,1
every one, I think, out there,
on overall just riding.


519
0:22:2,1 --> 0:22:4,79
And he was throwing tail
grab 7's and 9's.


520
0:22:4,79 --> 0:22:6,23
I know 7's.


521
0:22:6,23 --> 0:22:8,55
I think 9's too.


522
0:22:8,55 --> 0:22:12,19
And just crazy stuff and like
super smooth style.


523
0:22:12,19 --> 0:22:15,22
I've always looked up to him
always thought he was just one


524
0:22:15,22 --> 0:22:16,78
of the best for sure, timeless.


525
0:22:16,78 --> 0:24:16,78
