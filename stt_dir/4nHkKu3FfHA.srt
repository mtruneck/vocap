1
0:0:3,5 --> 0:0:11,7
Let's welcome Ted Zoller to Sanford. Thank you, Tom. Thanks a lot.


2
0:0:11,7 --> 0:0:15,92
So my job today is, I think, primarily to entertain, right.


3
0:0:15,92 --> 0:0:19,49
If I'm boring you in this lecture, I'm doing the wrong thing.


4
0:0:19,49 --> 0:0:21,52
I'm aware of that.


5
0:0:21,52 --> 0:0:23,91
The other thing is I would fully expect with this kind of brain


6
0:0:23,91 --> 0:0:28,3
power in this room that you would just interrupt me, right.


7
0:0:28,3 --> 0:0:31,82
So I fully expect you all to challenge some of my thinking,


8
0:0:31,82 --> 0:0:33,62
maybe bring up your own ideas.


9
0:0:33,62 --> 0:0:36,2
Throw me off balance everyone once in a while.


10
0:0:36,2 --> 0:0:38,44
I will hope that you'd be willing to do that.


11
0:0:38,44 --> 0:0:41,78
I'm very privileged to be here, as you could expect.


12
0:0:41,78 --> 0:0:44,42
But I know you're very privileged to be here as well.


13
0:0:44,42 --> 0:0:46,34
This is one of the finest institutions.


14
0:0:46,34 --> 0:0:48,6
If not the finest institution of higher education


15
0:0:48,6 --> 0:0:50,45
and I'm going to prove it today.


16
0:0:50,45 --> 0:0:54,3
Today I actually have empirical data that shows Stanford's place


17
0:0:54,3 --> 0:0:57,55
in the sun and why you should be very proud to be here.


18
0:0:57,55 --> 0:0:59,87
So this is what I'm planning to do.


19
0:0:59,87 --> 0:1:2,44
I wanted to share with you just a few ideas on whether


20
0:1:2,44 --> 0:1:5,99
or not you think that you're fully networked.


21
0:1:5,99 --> 0:1:11,9
I think it's somewhat appropriate that today Facebook IPO, right.


22
0:1:11,9 --> 0:1:14,24
Facebook announced that they were going to go for an IPO, right.


23
0:1:14,24 --> 0:1:15,91
So this is a pretty important day.


24
0:1:15,91 --> 0:1:18,88
But you should be asking yourself whether or not you're networked


25
0:1:18,88 --> 0:1:21,2
in the way to fuel your entrepreneurial future?


26
0:1:21,2 --> 0:1:24,28
And I will show you a few ideas that you should start to think


27
0:1:24,28 --> 0:1:27,21
about as you're putting together your professional path.


28
0:1:27,21 --> 0:1:29,84
So I'm prepared to answer five questions today.


29
0:1:29,84 --> 0:1:32,93
The five questions start with,


30
0:1:32,93 --> 0:1:36,82
what are the ingredients ultimately of a high impact entrepreneur?


31
0:1:36,82 --> 0:1:39,23
Ultimately, why is Silicon Valley the very best


32
0:1:39,23 --> 0:1:41,67
place in the world to be an entrepreneur?


33
0:1:41,67 --> 0:1:44,68
Thirdly, how do I take fullest advantage of my


34
0:1:44,68 --> 0:1:47,59
time at this institution to gain an advantage.


35
0:1:47,59 --> 0:1:49,26
I think it's important for all of you.


36
0:1:49,26 --> 0:1:52,29
This is a precious four years of your life,


37
0:1:52,29 --> 0:1:53,73
if you are an undergraduate.


38
0:1:53,73 --> 0:1:56,1
Two or three years, if you're a graduate student.


39
0:1:56,1 --> 0:1:57,22
And if you're a PhD student,


40
0:1:57,22 --> 0:2:1,4
you're probably going to be indentured for the next 20 years.


41
0:2:1,4 --> 0:2:3,73
That's my full expectation.


42
0:2:3,73 --> 0:2:6,78
Then what path will likely lead to my success while I'm here?


43
0:2:6,78 --> 0:2:8,25
Taking full advantage of that.


44
0:2:8,25 --> 0:2:10,34
And then lastly, I will prove to you why is it -


45
0:2:10,34 --> 0:2:13,66
why is that Stanford bill completely worth it?


46
0:2:13,66 --> 0:2:16,9
That's probably more of a question that your parents


47
0:2:16,9 --> 0:2:19,49
would like to have the answer for, right? So there you go.


48
0:2:19,49 --> 0:2:20,93
So starting with the first one,


49
0:2:20,93 --> 0:2:23,5
what are the ingredients of high performance entrepreneurship?


50
0:2:23,5 --> 0:2:24,78
You know it occurs to me in the work that I've had - I've had


51
0:2:24,78 --> 0:2:26,71
the privilege of working with entrepreneurs all my life,


52
0:2:26,71 --> 0:2:29,5
I was an entrepreneur earlier in my life and I now


53
0:2:29,5 --> 0:2:31,77
have worked now with hundreds of entrepreneurs.


54
0:2:31,77 --> 0:2:35,29
I've had a lot of great success in working and enjoying their


55
0:2:35,29 --> 0:2:38,95
stories and one of the reasons why I love Silicon Valley is,


56
0:2:38,95 --> 0:2:41,1
it's a place of real attitude.


57
0:2:41,1 --> 0:2:45,86
Starts out with maybe the character of a Steve Jobs,


58
0:2:45,86 --> 0:2:50,83
the attitude of a Vinod Khosla, right.


59
0:2:50,83 --> 0:2:54,3
Here is Hewlett Packard, in front of the iconic garage, right.


60
0:2:54,3 --> 0:2:55,93
How many of you think about garage entrepreneurship,


61
0:2:55,93 --> 0:3:1,48
that all started here. And that is the garage that's on the actual


62
0:3:1,48 --> 0:3:4,87
list of historic places as a matter of fact.


63
0:3:4,87 --> 0:3:9,86
Andy Grove, he is the model of persistence, right.


64
0:3:9,86 --> 0:3:11,95
And then of course the Google guys.


65
0:3:11,95 --> 0:3:13,27
We're talking about the cool factor.


66
0:3:13,27 --> 0:3:17,2
And of course why I love Silicon Valley is Stanford University,


67
0:3:17,2 --> 0:3:20,61
can we all say, absolutely right?


68
0:3:20,61 --> 0:3:23,0
But the truth is - the secrets of entrepreneurship


69
0:3:23,0 --> 0:3:24,19
is literally everywhere.


70
0:3:24,19 --> 0:3:26,83
It's everywhere where you are, everywhere worldwide.


71
0:3:26,83 --> 0:3:31,12
I know that this is being broadcast all over the world now and everyone


72
0:3:31,12 --> 0:3:34,45
who is watching this podcast is surrounded by entrepreneurs.


73
0:3:34,45 --> 0:3:35,87
Just want to tell a few stories.


74
0:3:35,87 --> 0:3:39,67
There is a person Amit Singh, he is one of my heroes.


75
0:3:39,67 --> 0:3:43,47
Amit was in my class four years ago and now has a company


76
0:3:43,47 --> 0:3:45,86
that's in the top three fastest growing companies in


77
0:3:45,86 --> 0:3:48,81
the North - in the Southeast of the United States.


78
0:3:48,81 --> 0:3:53,61
He started literally as a programmer in a cube,


79
0:3:53,61 --> 0:3:56,61
now has 700 employees over three continents and


80
0:3:56,61 --> 0:3:58,62
literally has all the equity of the company.


81
0:3:58,62 --> 0:4:1,62
He never had to raise money to build that company.


82
0:4:1,62 --> 0:4:4,4
Now that's an entrepreneur.


83
0:4:4,4 --> 0:4:5,2
Here is Ryan Stone.


84
0:4:5,2 --> 0:4:7,52
Ryan Stone came to me about seven years ago and said,


85
0:4:7,52 --> 0:4:11,91
Ted, you know what I want to do? I want to start a new airline.


86
0:4:11,91 --> 0:4:14,94
My first reaction was oh, my god. Holy shit.


87
0:4:14,94 --> 0:4:16,48
This is not what you want to be starting,


88
0:4:16,48 --> 0:4:19,72
this is the worst possible - he said hold on, hold on.


89
0:4:19,72 --> 0:4:21,74
I have a really great business model.


90
0:4:21,74 --> 0:4:23,83
I want to link with high growth companies that see


91
0:4:23,83 --> 0:4:26,78
aviation as a strategic advantage and now he is


92
0:4:26,78 --> 0:4:30,69
flying a fleet of 10 of the fastest aircraft.


93
0:4:30,69 --> 0:4:33,92
He hadn't had to spend a dollar on building that network.


94
0:4:33,92 --> 0:4:34,85
And as a matter of fact,


95
0:4:34,85 --> 0:4:38,63
now he is running that airline and it's extraordinarily powerful.


96
0:4:38,63 --> 0:4:43,554
Again, a great entrepreneur, who's build a great business model.


97
0:4:43,554 --> 0:4:46,78
Here is Monica Tomasso. Monica is also my hero.


98
0:4:46,78 --> 0:4:49,85
She was really interested in trying to change the


99
0:4:49,85 --> 0:4:52,77
nature of nutrition in the K-12 environment.


100
0:4:52,77 --> 0:4:57,8
We are feeding our kids garbage and she wanted to change that.


101
0:4:57,8 --> 0:4:59,205
She has been shipping over 2,500 lunches


102
0:4:59,205 --> 0:5:3,7
to K-12 students in the mid-Atlantic and uses


103
0:5:3,7 --> 0:5:7,21
it as for passion to drive this message home.


104
0:5:7,21 --> 0:5:10,43
These three guys, have you ever seen the movie Office Space?


105
0:5:10,43 --> 0:5:11,2
Right.


106
0:5:11,2 --> 0:5:11,814
You know that movie,


107
0:5:11,814 --> 0:5:15,17
remember that scene with - when they take out the printer or


108
0:5:15,17 --> 0:5:19,2
with bat and they just hammer that printer with the bat.


109
0:5:19,2 --> 0:5:20,98
That was the mantra of these three gentlemen.


110
0:5:20,98 --> 0:5:23,77
They were all sitting in cubes at Cisco System.


111
0:5:23,77 --> 0:5:25,79
They decided they wanted to change their lives,


112
0:5:25,79 --> 0:5:27,73
they started a microbrewery.


113
0:5:27,73 --> 0:5:29,72
That microbrewery has been widely successful,


114
0:5:29,72 --> 0:5:31,26
a company called Lonerider.


115
0:5:31,26 --> 0:5:33,71
That is still their mantra, they're having more fun today.


116
0:5:33,71 --> 0:5:35,59
Again, they all through in $25,000


117
0:5:35,59 --> 0:5:39,1
a piece and now are free cash flow.


118
0:5:39,1 --> 0:5:40,52
These two fellows who I'm very,


119
0:5:40,52 --> 0:5:42,41
very proud of, Tom Fischer on the right is one


120
0:5:42,41 --> 0:5:46,31
of the foremost scientists in blood sciences.


121
0:5:46,31 --> 0:5:50,54
He has come up with lyophilized platelets. You know platelets?


122
0:5:50,54 --> 0:5:53,13
We usually donate it like you would donate your blood,


123
0:5:53,13 --> 0:5:57,9
when they last for a few days because they spoil.


124
0:5:57,9 --> 0:5:59,55
He has come up with a way to freeze dry platelets.


125
0:5:59,55 --> 0:6:2,54
But what's interesting about this story is the guy in the left,


126
0:6:2,54 --> 0:6:5,41
Stan Eskridge, great entrepreneur.


127
0:6:5,41 --> 0:6:8,13
Doesn't know anything about science, he'd be the first one to admit,


128
0:6:8,13 --> 0:6:10,47
I'm the farthest you can get from being a scientist.


129
0:6:10,47 --> 0:6:13,1
He said, you know it would make a lot of sense if we could


130
0:6:13,1 --> 0:6:16,37
actually put those platelets and embed them in a textile.


131
0:6:16,37 --> 0:6:18,45
And they came up with a field dressing that could actually be


132
0:6:18,45 --> 0:6:23,3
mounted in front of a person who has large hemorrhagic wounds.


133
0:6:23,3 --> 0:6:25,14
And guess what that product is being used in the


134
0:6:25,14 --> 0:6:28,38
front lines in Afghanistan to help our soldiers.


135
0:6:28,38 --> 0:6:30,95
So those are my heroes, right.


136
0:6:30,95 --> 0:6:33,77
We can talk about the great athlete with the great speed.


137
0:6:33,77 --> 0:6:36,38
But these are entrepreneurs who are all around us.


138
0:6:36,38 --> 0:6:38,89
These are entrepreneurs that are in this room, right now.


139
0:6:38,89 --> 0:6:42,37
These are the entrepreneurs that inspire me.


140
0:6:42,37 --> 0:6:46,47
So, Dr. Byers has probably hammered this into your head.


141
0:6:46,47 --> 0:6:48,19
Where does great entrepreneurship start?


142
0:6:48,19 --> 0:6:52,7
Usually with innovation, right. It starts here. It doesn't end here.


143
0:6:52,7 --> 0:6:55,24
Let me just explain what I'm talking about.


144
0:6:55,24 --> 0:6:56,78
How many of you have at least one idea,


145
0:6:56,78 --> 0:6:58,29
that you could act on in your lifetime.


146
0:6:58,29 --> 0:7:0,84
You have one idea that you want to turn into a start-up company.


147
0:7:0,84 --> 0:7:2,49
How many? Raise your hand.


148
0:7:2,49 --> 0:7:5,82
Keep them high, don't put your hands down, okay.


149
0:7:5,82 --> 0:7:10,38
How many of you have three ideas? If you don't, drop your hands.


150
0:7:10,38 --> 0:7:13,83
How many of you have five ideas?


151
0:7:13,83 --> 0:7:17,437
Alright. How many of you have 10 ideas.


152
0:7:17,437 --> 0:7:20,66
Now these are really sick people. We need to study these people.


153
0:7:20,66 --> 0:7:23,91
These people are - keep your hands high, you should be proud of that.


154
0:7:23,91 --> 0:7:26,24
Now we need to understand these people because these


155
0:7:26,24 --> 0:7:29,9
are the people who can - please put your hands down,


156
0:7:29,9 --> 0:7:31,67
but we're going to celebrate you all.


157
0:7:31,67 --> 0:7:34,65
Because these are the people that fuel the future.


158
0:7:34,65 --> 0:7:37,89
But we have to unlock their potential.


159
0:7:37,89 --> 0:7:40,96
They come up with great transformative ideas everyday.


160
0:7:40,96 --> 0:7:42,24
But as you know entrepreneurship is


161
0:7:42,24 --> 0:7:44,31
about taking action on those ideas,


162
0:7:44,31 --> 0:7:48,66
making those ideas visible, rendering them available.


163
0:7:48,66 --> 0:7:50,38
So it's not enough to start with the idea,


164
0:7:50,38 --> 0:7:52,92
you have to start with the idea, but you have to act on the idea.


165
0:7:52,92 --> 0:7:55,3
And how many of you, just for curiosity's sake,


166
0:7:55,3 --> 0:7:59,11
how many of you can act on more than one idea at one time.


167
0:7:59,11 --> 0:8:0,77
Okay, raise your hands?


168
0:8:0,77 --> 0:8:3,76
Okay, how many of you are working with three ideas at one time?


169
0:8:3,76 --> 0:8:9,21
Anybody, how you're doing it? I know how you're doing it.


170
0:8:9,21 --> 0:8:12,12
Please, yeah. Yeah, I have three companies at the


171
0:8:12,12 --> 0:8:16,109
moment and switching between them.


172
0:8:16,109 --> 0:8:16,75
Right.


173
0:8:16,75 --> 0:8:18,96
And is your role different in those companies,


174
0:8:18,96 --> 0:8:21,93
are you the founder of all three, or are you the CEO of all three.


175
0:8:21,93 --> 0:8:25,39
Two of them. Two of them. And the last one is partnership. Okay.


176
0:8:25,39 --> 0:8:27,83
The third one is a partnership. So you're getting leverage.


177
0:8:27,83 --> 0:8:29,49
You're making ideas available and all these


178
0:8:29,49 --> 0:8:34,35
ideas are now taking root, right. These ideas are making it happen.


179
0:8:34,35 --> 0:8:37,74
So it's very common for entrepreneurs to


180
0:8:37,74 --> 0:8:39,539
find different ways to find leverage.


181
0:8:39,539 --> 0:8:42,74
You don't have to found the company necessarily to have impact.


182
0:8:42,74 --> 0:8:45,62
Your ideas need to be put into motion.


183
0:8:45,62 --> 0:8:47,44
That's what entrepreneurship is all about.


184
0:8:47,44 --> 0:8:49,64
So, if I updated that picture, I guess it would look like this.


185
0:8:49,64 --> 0:8:51,52
You all can do better than that, can't you?


186
0:8:51,52 --> 0:8:55,35
Let's do better than that. Oh, my God, so that's the best we can do.


187
0:8:55,35 --> 0:8:58,21
So, this is one of oldest ideas known to man,


188
0:8:58,21 --> 0:9:1,23
since Plato, right: necessity is the mother of invention.


189
0:9:1,23 --> 0:9:4,41
I'm really extremely bullish about the future of our world


190
0:9:4,41 --> 0:9:8,39
because we have gigantic challenges and we have your generation


191
0:9:8,39 --> 0:9:10,9
who is serious about solving those challenges.


192
0:9:10,9 --> 0:9:12,9
I'm really excited about the future of entrepreneurship


193
0:9:12,9 --> 0:9:14,91
because I honestly think that's one of the key


194
0:9:14,91 --> 0:9:19,95
answers to society's greatest problems, but it started with Plato.


195
0:9:19,95 --> 0:9:23,7
So, in many cases you start with the innovation, but it's not enough,


196
0:9:23,7 --> 0:9:25,13
you have to build something on top of that


197
0:9:25,13 --> 0:9:27,42
and that typically is the insight.


198
0:9:27,42 --> 0:9:31,16
That insight is how that innovation actually takes root,


199
0:9:31,16 --> 0:9:33,7
how it has impact, why it's meaningful.


200
0:9:33,7 --> 0:9:35,45
And I'd argue the type of entrepreneur that starts


201
0:9:35,45 --> 0:9:38,4
with the innovation usually is what I call an


202
0:9:38,4 --> 0:9:39,92
"innovation-based entrepreneur".


203
0:9:39,92 --> 0:9:42,3
But there is another typology of entrepreneurship,


204
0:9:42,3 --> 0:9:44,21
as a matter of fact that starts in a very different way.


205
0:9:44,21 --> 0:9:45,78
How many of you would start this way,


206
0:9:45,78 --> 0:9:49,65
start with the idea and then start to find a market for it?


207
0:9:49,65 --> 0:9:51,9
And maybe, okay, a lot of you are raising your hands.


208
0:9:51,9 --> 0:9:54,97
I think that's a typical modality, right?


209
0:9:54,97 --> 0:9:56,17
Ideas are inherently valuable,


210
0:9:56,17 --> 0:9:58,84
but ideas that are applied are invaluable.


211
0:9:58,84 --> 0:10:1,1
I would suggest that ideas that are left on your


212
0:10:1,1 --> 0:10:4,18
list that are not acted on are valueless.


213
0:10:4,18 --> 0:10:6,74
These are ideas that need to be released,


214
0:10:6,74 --> 0:10:10,55
make them available to society, don't leave them behind.


215
0:10:10,55 --> 0:10:13,3
I can't tell you and I bet some of you have been in that


216
0:10:13,3 --> 0:10:15,86
situation where some of the best ides you've had,


217
0:10:15,86 --> 0:10:19,64
you see someone else implement, you've that experience, right?


218
0:10:19,64 --> 0:10:21,76
You just let the world just pass you on by because


219
0:10:21,76 --> 0:10:23,73
you hadn't had the time to make it happen.


220
0:10:23,73 --> 0:10:26,38
Think about that leverage, the individuals who are doing two,


221
0:10:26,38 --> 0:10:29,42
three, four ideas at a time or working with teams of


222
0:10:29,42 --> 0:10:32,54
people to actually make these concepts available.


223
0:10:32,54 --> 0:10:36,15
You know, emulate them. Make that happen.


224
0:10:36,15 --> 0:10:37,98
The second piece is a game-changing solution.


225
0:10:37,98 --> 0:10:39,92
This is an ingredient that's really critical


226
0:10:39,92 --> 0:10:43,22
to high-performance entrepreneurship. What do I mean by that?


227
0:10:43,22 --> 0:10:46,4
Ultimately, as you look and this is a great illustration of all the things


228
0:10:46,4 --> 0:10:49,8
that are happening in the software and the web environment here,


229
0:10:49,8 --> 0:10:50,36
in the social media environment,


230
0:10:50,36 --> 0:10:51,97
and that it occurs to me that it's almost


231
0:10:51,97 --> 0:10:56,17
a daunting set of solutions, right?


232
0:10:56,17 --> 0:10:59,31
Which solutions are going to actually make their way through?


233
0:10:59,31 --> 0:11:1,56
You know, many of these started with, just like you started,


234
0:11:1,56 --> 0:11:3,95
an idea, but many of these solutions need


235
0:11:3,95 --> 0:11:6,42
to find their impact in the market.


236
0:11:6,42 --> 0:11:8,18
Only a few will make it through, right?


237
0:11:8,18 --> 0:11:10,44
There are certain applications,


238
0:11:10,44 --> 0:11:14,39
for instance, certain concepts that end up becoming platforms


239
0:11:14,39 --> 0:11:18,36
and then becoming kind of central to our lifestyles, right?


240
0:11:18,36 --> 0:11:20,26
It occurs to me when you look at your smartphone,


241
0:11:20,26 --> 0:11:23,84
for instance, how many of you have over 100 applications


242
0:11:23,84 --> 0:11:25,93
on your - apps on your iPhone now?


243
0:11:25,93 --> 0:11:28,68
Can I ask? More than 100 apps? Pretty common.


244
0:11:28,68 --> 0:11:31,9
How many do you use on a typical day?


245
0:11:31,9 --> 0:11:33,37
One, two, three, right, am I right?


246
0:11:33,37 --> 0:11:37,9
How many of you are developing apps, I'm just curious?


247
0:11:37,9 --> 0:11:39,73
How many of you are developing apps as we speak? Okay.


248
0:11:39,73 --> 0:11:43,2
What's it going to take to make yours a game-changing app?


249
0:11:43,2 --> 0:11:47,4
Think about it. What is it going to take to become a game-changer?


250
0:11:47,4 --> 0:11:49,48
That is what it's going to take.


251
0:11:49,48 --> 0:11:52,52
You've got to dial-in the notion of need,


252
0:11:52,52 --> 0:11:54,99
how ultimately is that need being satisfied,


253
0:11:54,99 --> 0:11:59,79
how is that pain ultimately being mitigated?


254
0:11:59,79 --> 0:12:1,62
I would argue that the intersection of opportunity


255
0:12:1,62 --> 0:12:3,88
and need is where the entrepreneur needs to live.


256
0:12:3,88 --> 0:12:7,73
Opportunity is the most exciting type of platform


257
0:12:7,73 --> 0:12:9,42
an entrepreneur lives in their life,


258
0:12:9,42 --> 0:12:14,88
but need ultimately crystallizes it. That's the acid test.


259
0:12:14,88 --> 0:12:16,74
I would argue that there's a class of entrepreneurs,


260
0:12:16,74 --> 0:12:19,99
you might be surprised by this, they don't start with an idea at all,


261
0:12:19,99 --> 0:12:22,4
they start maybe with the market try to understand


262
0:12:22,4 --> 0:12:24,59
what the problems are that we all face.


263
0:12:24,59 --> 0:12:27,33
As they're reading the blogs or as they're going through


264
0:12:27,33 --> 0:12:29,29
the web or as they're reading the newspaper,


265
0:12:29,29 --> 0:12:32,36
believe it or not, in the morning, they actually see compelling need.


266
0:12:32,36 --> 0:12:36,3
And on top of that, they define a real customer in their mind.


267
0:12:36,3 --> 0:12:39,17
They see a customer, I call that the beachhead.


268
0:12:39,17 --> 0:12:42,48
That need is critical. And I would argue that kind of entrepreneur


269
0:12:42,48 --> 0:12:43,54
is a marketplace entrepreneur.


270
0:12:43,54 --> 0:12:45,49
They don't start with the innovation,


271
0:12:45,49 --> 0:12:47,51
they start with the problem and then they


272
0:12:47,51 --> 0:12:49,75
acquire innovation to solve the problem.


273
0:12:49,75 --> 0:12:53,67
These are conjoined and they match.


274
0:12:53,67 --> 0:12:56,6
So, the market is my wisest teacher.


275
0:12:56,6 --> 0:12:59,6
Honestly, the market will tell you whether or not your idea is going


276
0:12:59,6 --> 0:13:2,36
to gain relevance because people will walk with their feet.


277
0:13:2,36 --> 0:13:5,33
The market is a beautiful crystallizing test,


278
0:13:5,33 --> 0:13:7,53
launch and learns where it's better than learn and launch,


279
0:13:7,53 --> 0:13:8,75
you know, I saw that Steve Blank was here,


280
0:13:8,75 --> 0:13:11,26
for instance, absolutely true,


281
0:13:11,26 --> 0:13:14,7
they're bringing the market into the equation much earlier.


282
0:13:14,7 --> 0:13:15,89
Will help you test your ideas to see if


283
0:13:15,89 --> 0:13:18,78
they actually will make their way through.


284
0:13:18,78 --> 0:13:20,49
Okay, so let's bring these two concepts together;


285
0:13:20,49 --> 0:13:22,68
the market, the innovation.


286
0:13:22,68 --> 0:13:23,4
On top of the market,


287
0:13:23,4 --> 0:13:25,23
you have the beachhead and top of the innovation,


288
0:13:25,23 --> 0:13:25,9
you have the insight.


289
0:13:25,9 --> 0:13:30,34
What do you suppose is at that intersection point?


290
0:13:30,34 --> 0:13:34,72
We all said this word, right? It's a value-prop.


291
0:13:34,72 --> 0:13:37,85
That value-prop is the driver.


292
0:13:37,85 --> 0:13:39,87
It is ultimately how you are going to make


293
0:13:39,87 --> 0:13:42,81
the decisions you're going to make, as to how you use your time.


294
0:13:42,81 --> 0:13:45,25
Now, I see that as a function of expert entrepreneurship.


295
0:13:45,25 --> 0:13:47,19
So, for those of you who start with the innovation;


296
0:13:47,19 --> 0:13:49,64
balance it by looking at the market and the need.


297
0:13:49,64 --> 0:13:51,63
For those of you who start and don't have original ideas,


298
0:13:51,63 --> 0:13:53,78
and I'm guessing not many of you are like that,


299
0:13:53,78 --> 0:13:56,61
but can I ask you, are there any folks in here that have


300
0:13:56,61 --> 0:13:59,65
never had an original idea in their entire life?


301
0:13:59,65 --> 0:14:2,65
Seriously? Is there anybody in here?


302
0:14:2,65 --> 0:14:4,5
There's got to be one brave soul, let's say, you know,


303
0:14:4,5 --> 0:14:5,5
to be honest with you,


304
0:14:5,5 --> 0:14:7,65
I'm in the middle of all these brilliant people and I don't know,


305
0:14:7,65 --> 0:14:11,64
squat, you know, but I know how to help people who have ideas.


306
0:14:11,64 --> 0:14:15,39
There is no one in this room? Fascinating.


307
0:14:15,39 --> 0:14:18,78
Fascinating, I guess it's not surprising. Are you that guy?


308
0:14:18,78 --> 0:14:22,7
Okay, alright, thank you, Tom. Thank you for helping me out.


309
0:14:22,7 --> 0:14:24,93
Alright, the third part of the strategy here is that that


310
0:14:24,93 --> 0:14:28,65
you have to be able to execute and execution is critical.


311
0:14:28,65 --> 0:14:33,22
Execution is the function of actually putting your ideas in motion.


312
0:14:33,22 --> 0:14:35,21
When you have something so complicated


313
0:14:35,21 --> 0:14:38,66
that people don't understand it, you're doing the wrong thing.


314
0:14:38,66 --> 0:14:41,23
The best business models are usually the most simple business models.


315
0:14:41,23 --> 0:14:45,66
The ones you can communicate, the ones you can actually evangelize.


316
0:14:45,66 --> 0:14:46,91
These are the ones that actually can


317
0:14:46,91 --> 0:14:51,5
bring people to follow you, right? So, avoid complexity?


318
0:14:51,5 --> 0:14:54,4
Your left brain kind of function, I'm this kind of person,


319
0:14:54,4 --> 0:14:56,89
I love to get underneath it - I love to get underneath


320
0:14:56,89 --> 0:14:59,42
the - to look underneath the hood,


321
0:14:59,42 --> 0:15:1,65
I want to tinker with the engine, right?


322
0:15:1,65 --> 0:15:4,46
Engineers love to tinker with the engine, am I right?


323
0:15:4,46 --> 0:15:7,9
You're the operating guy. You want to figure out how it works.


324
0:15:7,9 --> 0:15:10,15
You want to take a part and make it better usually, right?


325
0:15:10,15 --> 0:15:11,47
But there is another kind of entrepreneur,


326
0:15:11,47 --> 0:15:12,81
believe it or not, and most of them are sitting


327
0:15:12,81 --> 0:15:15,54
over the business school right now, right?


328
0:15:15,54 --> 0:15:17,84
And I would call them right-brain entrepreneurs.


329
0:15:17,84 --> 0:15:20,29
These are the people that will say, Ted, you know, seriously,


330
0:15:20,29 --> 0:15:23,47
you're spending all your time trying to figure this thing out,


331
0:15:23,47 --> 0:15:25,52
and you're just wasting your time,


332
0:15:25,52 --> 0:15:29,9
this isn't worth doing it, you don't do it. Why would you do that?


333
0:15:29,9 --> 0:15:32,67
I tend to enjoy this and I always disdain the term vulture


334
0:15:32,67 --> 0:15:39,36
capital because it suggests that money is evil. Money is your tool;


335
0:15:39,36 --> 0:15:41,24
you should embrace that concept in order


336
0:15:41,24 --> 0:15:44,76
to make your ideas available, right? Make your ideas available.


337
0:15:44,76 --> 0:15:48,54
So, don't be afraid of money because money is ultimately the tool.


338
0:15:48,54 --> 0:15:51,58
Somebody wrote a piece in the Huffington Post and someone


339
0:15:51,58 --> 0:15:54,74
wrote a post responding to it and they said,


340
0:15:54,74 --> 0:15:57,43
you know, money is like manure, just spread it around,


341
0:15:57,43 --> 0:15:58,75
make things grow faster.


342
0:15:58,75 --> 0:16:2,39
Yeah, that is the point, you know, I can understand that.


343
0:16:2,39 --> 0:16:4,49
But I want you to just challenge yourself when you


344
0:16:4,49 --> 0:16:8,59
look at that and I find this with engineers a lot.


345
0:16:8,59 --> 0:16:12,11
When you look at that glass, how many of you see a glass half-empty?


346
0:16:12,11 --> 0:16:16,63
You see the potential of it, but you need - you see it half-empty.


347
0:16:16,63 --> 0:16:19,822
Can you raise your hand? How many of you see it half-empty?


348
0:16:19,822 --> 0:16:23,592
How many of you see half-full? You're optimistic, right?


349
0:16:23,592 --> 0:16:25,81
I would argue that when are you when you're building a great venture;


350
0:16:25,81 --> 0:16:27,23
you want to take advantage of the people


351
0:16:27,23 --> 0:16:30,36
who are both optimists and pessimists,


352
0:16:30,36 --> 0:16:33,12
individuals who can ask all the right questions.


353
0:16:33,12 --> 0:16:34,66
So, the people that raised their hands,


354
0:16:34,66 --> 0:16:36,35
saying I see it as a glass half-empty,


355
0:16:36,35 --> 0:16:40,11
they are the ones that are well of knowledge of what are


356
0:16:40,11 --> 0:16:43,11
the barriers you need to overcome to make it successful.


357
0:16:43,11 --> 0:16:47,22
You want a game-changing solution, find that opportunity.


358
0:16:47,22 --> 0:16:49,16
So, discovering that business model will allow


359
0:16:49,16 --> 0:16:51,8
you to soar over some of the key challenges,


360
0:16:51,8 --> 0:16:54,98
some of the key barriers and vet that opportunity.


361
0:16:54,98 --> 0:16:55,55
Okay.


362
0:16:55,55 --> 0:16:57,62
So you bring your business model together,


363
0:16:57,62 --> 0:16:59,7
you balance it with your financial model.


364
0:16:59,7 --> 0:17:2,53
On top of your business model, your strategy, you attract leadership,


365
0:17:2,53 --> 0:17:5,21
the people that you would implement with your business model.


366
0:17:5,21 --> 0:17:6,34
The financial model you bring;


367
0:17:6,34 --> 0:17:7,58
the tools and implementation,


368
0:17:7,58 --> 0:17:11,7
all the assets you need to build your venture, right? Guess what


369
0:17:11,7 --> 0:17:13,8
else that intersection? Think you can guess?


370
0:17:13,8 --> 0:17:17,26
It's a value-prop, right? That's a function of execution.


371
0:17:17,26 --> 0:17:19,32
These are the things you do after you are in motion,


372
0:17:19,32 --> 0:17:21,83
after innovation the market comes together.


373
0:17:21,83 --> 0:17:23,73
So, let's try to understand this as a system.


374
0:17:23,73 --> 0:17:27,73
It also occurs to me that entrepreneurs don't think,


375
0:17:27,73 --> 0:17:31,19
as we've learned from Sarasvati, strategically.


376
0:17:31,19 --> 0:17:32,94
They are very opportunistic.


377
0:17:32,94 --> 0:17:34,77
They start with an insight,


378
0:17:34,77 --> 0:17:37,35
they add to it an understanding of a customer,


379
0:17:37,35 --> 0:17:39,79
they try to understand how you can bring other people into the


380
0:17:39,79 --> 0:17:42,36
equation by assembling people around the idea with leadership,


381
0:17:42,36 --> 0:17:46,6
and they see all the assets and bring it together,


382
0:17:46,6 --> 0:17:48,84
again, informed by the value-prop, right?


383
0:17:48,84 --> 0:17:50,7
That's how the entrepreneur usually starts.


384
0:17:50,7 --> 0:17:54,65
They don't think top-down, they think bottom-up.


385
0:17:54,65 --> 0:17:57,55
So, let's bring it all together.


386
0:17:57,55 --> 0:18:0,1
The market, innovation and top of the market,


387
0:18:0,1 --> 0:18:1,43
the beachhead and top of the innovation,


388
0:18:1,43 --> 0:18:3,51
the insight, you have the business model,


389
0:18:3,51 --> 0:18:6,15
financial model, add to it leadership,


390
0:18:6,15 --> 0:18:8,37
add to the financial model your implementation,


391
0:18:8,37 --> 0:18:11,44
all structured around the guiding principle of the value-prop.


392
0:18:11,44 --> 0:18:13,92
Again back up in the 1980s - back in the 1980s,


393
0:18:13,92 --> 0:18:16,4
I used to have a shirt looks just like that,


394
0:18:16,4 --> 0:18:18,42
I'm surprised I am not wearing it still today.


395
0:18:18,42 --> 0:18:21,34
But that's the way I look at entrepreneurship.


396
0:18:21,34 --> 0:18:24,22
In many ways that this model actually captures many of


397
0:18:24,22 --> 0:18:26,47
the ways people approach entrepreneurship and that you


398
0:18:26,47 --> 0:18:29,91
have to integrate these elements into your thinking.


399
0:18:29,91 --> 0:18:31,58
Not everyone on your team,


400
0:18:31,58 --> 0:18:35,3
by the way, has everything on this picture.


401
0:18:35,3 --> 0:18:40,2
You have to build a team that fills out the full equation.


402
0:18:40,2 --> 0:18:43,51
Alright, what's the next piece? Let's look for a leapfrog strategy.


403
0:18:43,51 --> 0:18:46,21
You know not one of your entrepreneurial efforts will be successful


404
0:18:46,21 --> 0:18:49,96
if it incrementally improves the market opportunity.


405
0:18:49,96 --> 0:18:53,1
Very difficult to build the business on an incremental improvement,


406
0:18:53,1 --> 0:18:55,34
you really need a leapfrog strategy and it occurs to


407
0:18:55,34 --> 0:18:59,19
me many of you probably admire these two guys, right?


408
0:18:59,19 --> 0:19:3,37
I admit. I'm a geek. I'm a trekkie.


409
0:19:3,37 --> 0:19:6,23
Unfortunately, my trekkie was this, right.


410
0:19:6,23 --> 0:19:9,3
These two guys, you know, little old school realize that.


411
0:19:9,3 --> 0:19:10,17
A lot of ways, you know,


412
0:19:10,17 --> 0:19:12,9
the generational gap is starting to really show up in my life,


413
0:19:12,9 --> 0:19:14,17
you know, every day.


414
0:19:14,17 --> 0:19:14,8
But it occurs to me,


415
0:19:14,8 --> 0:19:17,0
I remember when I was watching these two fellows and,


416
0:19:17,0 --> 0:19:21,89
Spock was in the cabin and he was playing three-level chess.


417
0:19:21,89 --> 0:19:24,38
And I just remember this, it scored in my mind.


418
0:19:24,38 --> 0:19:25,78
So I was thinking to myself,


419
0:19:25,78 --> 0:19:30,68
a great entrepreneur doesn't play checkers, they don't play chess,


420
0:19:30,68 --> 0:19:33,14
they play chess on three levels.


421
0:19:33,14 --> 0:19:35,2
You think about what Steve Jobs did, for instance.


422
0:19:35,2 --> 0:19:37,42
You know, everyone talking about Steve Jobs,


423
0:19:37,42 --> 0:19:39,58
but this is the person who had something locked and loaded,


424
0:19:39,58 --> 0:19:41,84
ready to go while he was implementing the thing


425
0:19:41,84 --> 0:19:44,23
that was already rocking our world, right?


426
0:19:44,23 --> 0:19:47,66
He was playing three levels as opposed to his


427
0:19:47,66 --> 0:19:49,83
competitors who are barely playing checkers,


428
0:19:49,83 --> 0:19:53,96
if not emulating the possibility of playing chess at his level.


429
0:19:53,96 --> 0:19:56,66
So that three level chess game is something


430
0:19:56,66 --> 0:19:58,14
you have to be thinking about.


431
0:19:58,14 --> 0:20:3,4
And honestly, a leapfrog strategy is thinking how the world adapts,


432
0:20:3,4 --> 0:20:5,92
how it evolves and what's going to happen in the future


433
0:20:5,92 --> 0:20:9,0
when you make educated hunches how to make that happen.


434
0:20:9,0 --> 0:20:13,21
That results in not an incremental improvement but a leapfrog,


435
0:20:13,21 --> 0:20:15,31
or league improvement.


436
0:20:15,31 --> 0:20:19,17
And by the way that's my Captain Kirk. It's kind of sad, isn't it?


437
0:20:19,17 --> 0:20:24,37
I love William Shatner, but boy that ages me, ouch, right?


438
0:20:24,37 --> 0:20:25,85
The next piece is serendipity.


439
0:20:25,85 --> 0:20:29,38
And I can't really teach you this, but serendipity plays a huge role,


440
0:20:29,38 --> 0:20:31,82
and you now I disdain the idea that entrepreneurs


441
0:20:31,82 --> 0:20:35,75
are lucky and it's all about luck. I don't think that's true at all.


442
0:20:35,75 --> 0:20:38,4
Entrepreneurs take advantage of serendipity.


443
0:20:38,4 --> 0:20:40,55
Let me explain what I mean.


444
0:20:40,55 --> 0:20:43,18
I know so many entrepreneurs who are like the Forrest Gump's,


445
0:20:43,18 --> 0:20:44,81
you know, remember the scene when he was meeting


446
0:20:44,81 --> 0:20:46,39
John F. Kennedy and he'd already met,


447
0:20:46,39 --> 0:20:49,57
and I guess President Johnson or vice versa.


448
0:20:49,57 --> 0:20:52,89
He said; I have to go to the White House again, right?


449
0:20:52,89 --> 0:20:57,49
So, you know, this idea of serendipity is so interesting to me


450
0:20:57,49 --> 0:21:1,96
because entrepreneurs put themselves in a position to be lucky.


451
0:21:1,96 --> 0:21:5,23
They put themselves in a position to be fortunate. Why?


452
0:21:5,23 --> 0:21:8,23
To prepare their minds to take full advantage


453
0:21:8,23 --> 0:21:12,32
of that opportunity when it presents itself.


454
0:21:12,32 --> 0:21:16,57
So, here's Louis Pasteur, chance favors the prepared mind, right?


455
0:21:16,57 --> 0:21:19,42
Have you ever thought to yourself for a moment?


456
0:21:19,42 --> 0:21:22,68
Have you prepared yourself to be fortunate?


457
0:21:22,68 --> 0:21:25,89
Have you prepared your thought pattern,


458
0:21:25,89 --> 0:21:29,45
your action agenda so that when that opportunity presents itself,


459
0:21:29,45 --> 0:21:31,83
you're ready to grab it?


460
0:21:31,83 --> 0:21:34,46
Have you prepared yourself for that moment?


461
0:21:34,46 --> 0:21:37,45
And it occurs to me that when we talk about luck,


462
0:21:37,45 --> 0:21:38,96
we eat Google fortune right now,


463
0:21:38,96 --> 0:21:43,11
you know what shows up first on Google, when you Google fortune?


464
0:21:43,11 --> 0:21:45,17
That picture. That's sad.


465
0:21:45,17 --> 0:21:48,77
Vanna White is their idea of fortune, right?


466
0:21:48,77 --> 0:21:50,88
And many of us think about the roulette wheel.


467
0:21:50,88 --> 0:21:53,4
I was going through an airport.


468
0:21:53,4 --> 0:21:55,13
I was at Heathrow Airport as a matter of fact.


469
0:21:55,13 --> 0:21:57,56
And this young lady was watching all the


470
0:21:57,56 --> 0:21:59,58
bags go through the x-ray machine.


471
0:21:59,58 --> 0:22:1,39
And they turned - she turned to one of our


472
0:22:1,39 --> 0:22:6,2
colleagues and said Black 7 is my future. Black 7 is my future.


473
0:22:6,2 --> 0:22:9,82
And I was listening and while she was talking all the bags were flying


474
0:22:9,82 --> 0:22:12,2
by and she wasn't even looking at them and like, oh, my god.


475
0:22:12,2 --> 0:22:14,93
That's my future, but I don't want to listen in.


476
0:22:14,93 --> 0:22:19,54
She said I am going to go this weekend and blow all of my weeks' pay,


477
0:22:19,54 --> 0:22:21,8
play at the casino on Black 7.


478
0:22:21,8 --> 0:22:23,38
And I thought to myself,


479
0:22:23,38 --> 0:22:26,65
oh, man, this is a young lady who really hasn't


480
0:22:26,65 --> 0:22:29,83
learned what fortune is all about, right?


481
0:22:29,83 --> 0:22:31,55
Let me share with you what I think it is,


482
0:22:31,55 --> 0:22:33,26
and by the way I don't think Harvard has got it right either.


483
0:22:33,26 --> 0:22:35,27
Harvard Business School has this concept of the cash wheel,


484
0:22:35,27 --> 0:22:36,63
the profit wheel and the ROE wheel.


485
0:22:36,63 --> 0:22:43,16
They don't get it. The ideas of fortune really come from the ages.


486
0:22:43,16 --> 0:22:44,18
As a matter of fact,


487
0:22:44,18 --> 0:22:46,94
I would argue the Eastern traditions and philosophy probably


488
0:22:46,94 --> 0:22:50,0
have retained and captured those ideas better than the West.


489
0:22:50,0 --> 0:22:52,29
We've lost these ideas.


490
0:22:52,29 --> 0:22:56,2
The best way I can explain it, would be to use Niccolo Machiavelli.


491
0:22:56,2 --> 0:22:58,32
He wrote a great book called The Discourses.


492
0:22:58,32 --> 0:23:1,52
Has anyone here who read The Discourses?


493
0:23:1,52 --> 0:23:5,42
Right. How many people have read, The Prince? Right.


494
0:23:5,42 --> 0:23:6,71
Go back and read The Discourses and


495
0:23:6,71 --> 0:23:7,99
I saw one person raise their hand,


496
0:23:7,99 --> 0:23:10,96
you raised it again proudly, right. The Discourses was a great book.


497
0:23:10,96 --> 0:23:12,83
And this was written when he was in prison,


498
0:23:12,83 --> 0:23:16,72
de' Medici had put him in prison. It was an angry, angry book.


499
0:23:16,72 --> 0:23:19,28
He talked about fortune as a set of wheels.


500
0:23:19,28 --> 0:23:21,81
And those wheels were turning in different directions,


501
0:23:21,81 --> 0:23:24,4
in different velocities.


502
0:23:24,4 --> 0:23:28,19
And a fortunate person is the person who jumps from wheel to wheel to


503
0:23:28,19 --> 0:23:32,56
wheel to wheel at the right moment and makes progress in their life.


504
0:23:32,56 --> 0:23:35,24
How many of you are sitting on that wheel right now,


505
0:23:35,24 --> 0:23:37,25
when the opportunity presents itself and


506
0:23:37,25 --> 0:23:39,959
you're just going to stay on it, right?


507
0:23:39,959 --> 0:23:42,62
An entrepreneur makes the move.


508
0:23:42,62 --> 0:23:44,68
One thing I had to learn as an entrepreneur,


509
0:23:44,68 --> 0:23:48,7
frankly, was to make the move.


510
0:23:48,7 --> 0:23:50,98
I wasn't prepared. I had to think everything through.


511
0:23:50,98 --> 0:23:54,71
I had to plan everything. Before I know, my competitors are already


512
0:23:54,71 --> 0:23:58,89
four steps down the road testing it out, trying it, making it happen,


513
0:23:58,89 --> 0:24:3,79
while I'm still thinking about it, right? So just hear me out.


514
0:24:3,79 --> 0:24:8,58
The seventh element, durable sustained profit, right?


515
0:24:8,58 --> 0:24:11,19
We talk a lot about profitability.


516
0:24:11,19 --> 0:24:12,69
But profit is a real key piece,


517
0:24:12,69 --> 0:24:14,44
because ultimately we're talking about the resources


518
0:24:14,44 --> 0:24:17,31
that allow you to reinvest in your own opportunity.


519
0:24:17,31 --> 0:24:20,45
And I love particularly recurring revenues.


520
0:24:20,45 --> 0:24:23,5
You know why I love recurring revenues?


521
0:24:23,5 --> 0:24:25,69
Because ultimately that's a durable business.


522
0:24:25,69 --> 0:24:28,37
I'm looking not only for the one-time revenue opportunity


523
0:24:28,37 --> 0:24:31,1
where am able to sell something and they always say,


524
0:24:31,1 --> 0:24:32,12
the dog eats the dog food.


525
0:24:32,12 --> 0:24:34,59
I hate that term, but boy it's absolutely true.


526
0:24:34,59 --> 0:24:37,34
But the dog continues eating, right?


527
0:24:37,34 --> 0:24:40,29
This is a business that's going to continue to be sustainable.


528
0:24:40,29 --> 0:24:43,53
It'll allow you to be successful, right?


529
0:24:43,53 --> 0:24:46,35
So we've talked a lot about the lifecycle of a business,


530
0:24:46,35 --> 0:24:48,27
every one of the concepts you have when you're building


531
0:24:48,27 --> 0:24:51,13
it into a business has an investment period, right?


532
0:24:51,13 --> 0:24:54,29
That J-curve we all talk about. Well the truth is;


533
0:24:54,29 --> 0:24:57,37
the J-curve is not one event, its multiple events.


534
0:24:57,37 --> 0:25:0,65
You have to break that big investment period down into smaller bite size


535
0:25:0,65 --> 0:25:6,44
units and then align capital ultimately will make you successful.


536
0:25:6,44 --> 0:25:8,82
We talk a lot about the business model but in many cases some


537
0:25:8,82 --> 0:25:12,29
of the key cognitive barriers that you put up in front of yourself


538
0:25:12,29 --> 0:25:14,71
actually become the reason you're not successful.


539
0:25:14,71 --> 0:25:16,84
Try to find the business model ultimately that's going


540
0:25:16,84 --> 0:25:20,38
to allow you to optimize the opportunity in the market.


541
0:25:20,38 --> 0:25:22,21
Don't try to find something so complicated


542
0:25:22,21 --> 0:25:25,38
you can't ultimately get it to work.


543
0:25:25,38 --> 0:25:31,41
It occurs to me that, Ronald Coase, great Nobel prize Laureate.


544
0:25:31,41 --> 0:25:33,54
Noble Laureate in economics,


545
0:25:33,54 --> 0:25:36,98
came up with transaction cost economics, right?


546
0:25:36,98 --> 0:25:39,91
Some of his insights, I think actually bear a lot of interest in


547
0:25:39,91 --> 0:25:42,46
terms of finding the right business model.


548
0:25:42,46 --> 0:25:44,62
He talked about optimizing on three levels;


549
0:25:44,62 --> 0:25:48,52
search, contracting and coordination, the cost of finding things,


550
0:25:48,52 --> 0:25:52,74
the cost of acquiring things and the cost of managing things.


551
0:25:52,74 --> 0:25:55,33
We're looking at optimizing on all three levels.


552
0:25:55,33 --> 0:25:56,85
Try to think about business models who allow


553
0:25:56,85 --> 0:25:59,98
you to optimize on all three of those levels.


554
0:25:59,98 --> 0:26:4,53
It occurs to me that you all face opportunities in your lifetimes


555
0:26:4,53 --> 0:26:7,8
that your parents and grandparents could not have conceived of.


556
0:26:7,8 --> 0:26:9,63
Largely because, you have business models available


557
0:26:9,63 --> 0:26:14,8
to you that your parents never experienced, right?


558
0:26:14,8 --> 0:26:19,73
So this becomes a tremendous opportunity for you all.


559
0:26:19,73 --> 0:26:22,14
I'm just giving you a lot to think about.


560
0:26:22,14 --> 0:26:24,31
And I'm just going to pause here for a moment.


561
0:26:24,31 --> 0:26:26,56
Anyone who want to challenge me?


562
0:26:26,56 --> 0:26:31,89
Anybody who want to raise a question or make a point?


563
0:26:31,89 --> 0:26:36,2
Please. You mentioned preparing yourself to sort of


564
0:26:36,2 --> 0:26:38,94
be ready for an opportunity when it comes.


565
0:26:38,94 --> 0:26:42,28
Did you have any particular types of preparation in mind?


566
0:26:42,28 --> 0:26:44,16
So, that's difficult.


567
0:26:44,16 --> 0:26:46,34
So you want to find out what degree to go get,


568
0:26:46,34 --> 0:26:49,73
you need to go to Harvard Business School and figure it out.


569
0:26:49,73 --> 0:26:51,24
As a matter of fact, I honestly think that,


570
0:26:51,24 --> 0:26:53,38
I am falling in love with apprenticeships,


571
0:26:53,38 --> 0:26:57,59
falling in love with following people who think entrepreneurially.


572
0:26:57,59 --> 0:27:1,6
I think it's a mindset, but I also think it's a pattern of action.


573
0:27:1,6 --> 0:27:3,54
And when you're preparing yourself,


574
0:27:3,54 --> 0:27:5,2
I think you prepare yourself intellectually


575
0:27:5,2 --> 0:27:6,88
like you are going to school now.


576
0:27:6,88 --> 0:27:9,76
But you prepare yourself for digging into


577
0:27:9,76 --> 0:27:11,63
the details of building a great business.


578
0:27:11,63 --> 0:27:14,26
And in many cases, really look to emulate the


579
0:27:14,26 --> 0:27:16,1
patterns of people who do it successfully.


580
0:27:16,1 --> 0:27:18,64
I am really thrilled that Tom is bringing in tremendous


581
0:27:18,64 --> 0:27:20,91
entrepreneurs who you get exposed to,


582
0:27:20,91 --> 0:27:22,98
because these are your teachers.


583
0:27:22,98 --> 0:27:25,6
You have two teachers, the people that you could understudy with,


584
0:27:25,6 --> 0:27:28,88
and I've had mentors my entire life that I've admired,


585
0:27:28,88 --> 0:27:31,48
but the market also brings a lot of clarity.


586
0:27:31,48 --> 0:27:34,66
Does that answer your question?


587
0:27:34,66 --> 0:27:36,17
Any other questions, please.


588
0:27:36,17 --> 0:27:39,17
You mentioned several friends at the beginning of your presentation.


589
0:27:39,17 --> 0:27:42,25
What was that airline called, that you're... Jetpool.


590
0:27:42,25 --> 0:27:45,51
Jetpool, it's based in Charlotte, North Carolina. He got very lucky.


591
0:27:45,51 --> 0:27:48,3
Very fortunate guy, Ryan Stone.


592
0:27:48,3 --> 0:27:54,87
Ryan had this idea in his mind that companies really needed aviation


593
0:27:54,87 --> 0:27:58,8
as a strategic tool and you know who partnered with him first?


594
0:27:58,8 --> 0:28:1,25
Have you ever heard of the company Nucor?


595
0:28:1,25 --> 0:28:5,34
It's a steel company. It uses a series of micro-mills.


596
0:28:5,34 --> 0:28:6,54
Why do they need aviation?


597
0:28:6,54 --> 0:28:10,26
They have these mills on all these small locations


598
0:28:10,26 --> 0:28:12,85
that are served by municipal airports,


599
0:28:12,85 --> 0:28:16,43
and a Citation X can land on a short runway.


600
0:28:16,43 --> 0:28:18,69
And all of their plant managers move around


601
0:28:18,69 --> 0:28:21,4
in this network of micro-mills. So this company;


602
0:28:21,4 --> 0:28:23,88
one of the most successful steel companies in the United States,


603
0:28:23,88 --> 0:28:27,13
leverages Jetpool as its tool of advantage.


604
0:28:27,13 --> 0:28:32,41
The day that the GM executives all landed to work with Congress,


605
0:28:32,41 --> 0:28:34,31
that was a good day for Jetpool.


606
0:28:34,31 --> 0:28:35,85
Let me tell you, because everyone wanted to get


607
0:28:35,85 --> 0:28:38,81
rid of their aviation departments, right?


608
0:28:38,81 --> 0:28:43,87
Alright. Please. How does globalization both help and hurt us?


609
0:28:43,87 --> 0:28:44,95
That's a difficult question.


610
0:28:44,95 --> 0:28:47,67
Globalization, we've all agree that globalization


611
0:28:47,67 --> 0:28:50,18
is now something we've embraced.


612
0:28:50,18 --> 0:28:53,81
This is now an integrated economy and people


613
0:28:53,81 --> 0:28:56,26
have to learn to see the world now,


614
0:28:56,26 --> 0:28:59,35
not just as a local market, not just as a regional market,


615
0:28:59,35 --> 0:29:4,87
not as a national market but as an international or global market.


616
0:29:4,87 --> 0:29:8,75
There will be changes that will naturally have to happen because this


617
0:29:8,75 --> 0:29:12,59
is a tremendous transformation we're going through economically.


618
0:29:12,59 --> 0:29:17,72
People will win, people will lose. It will make us sharper, honestly.


619
0:29:17,72 --> 0:29:20,8
Did you see the thing Steve Ballmer put out, I think a Bloomberg,


620
0:29:20,8 --> 0:29:23,62
the last issue of Bloomberg Businessweek.


621
0:29:23,62 --> 0:29:26,44
He talked about how when Microsoft was always in the lead,


622
0:29:26,44 --> 0:29:29,55
he didn't have to try very hard but now that


623
0:29:29,55 --> 0:29:31,22
they are lagging in several industries;


624
0:29:31,22 --> 0:29:34,53
they are now becoming entrepreneurial again.


625
0:29:34,53 --> 0:29:35,92
It's something that really gave me a lot of


626
0:29:35,92 --> 0:29:39,1
faith because as you are challenged further,


627
0:29:39,1 --> 0:29:42,92
I think you become greater at acting entrepreneurially.


628
0:29:42,92 --> 0:29:44,22
Any other questions, please.


629
0:29:44,22 --> 0:29:46,47
You indicated that a lot of the opportunities are


630
0:29:46,47 --> 0:29:50,25
a function of meeting a need in the marketplace.


631
0:29:50,25 --> 0:29:51,19
In the next four years,


632
0:29:51,19 --> 0:29:54,46
it's estimated that 80% of the growth and wealth in the world


633
0:29:54,46 --> 0:29:58,12
will happen outside of the United States and Western Europe


634
0:29:58,12 --> 0:30:2,57
and where the average income is roughly $3,000 a year.


635
0:30:2,57 --> 0:30:4,61
I suspect the problems they're trying to solve


636
0:30:4,61 --> 0:30:9,95
are something that we have no knowledge of. So how do we participate?


637
0:30:9,95 --> 0:30:13,55
This is one of the best opportunities I think we face because it challenges


638
0:30:13,55 --> 0:30:16,89
us to think through paradigms that we operate within the West.


639
0:30:16,89 --> 0:30:20,1
For instance, does healthcare have to be expensive.


640
0:30:20,1 --> 0:30:22,22
I've been really inspired by some of the


641
0:30:22,22 --> 0:30:23,89
healthcare leaders that are saying,


642
0:30:23,89 --> 0:30:29,36
look we are going to act forcefully to serve other people.


643
0:30:29,36 --> 0:30:31,71
I think we are going to change fundamentally some of the ways


644
0:30:31,71 --> 0:30:35,41
that we operate and the years of haves and have-nots,


645
0:30:35,41 --> 0:30:37,1
I think is going to break down.


646
0:30:37,1 --> 0:30:39,18
I honestly think that we're changing fundamentally


647
0:30:39,18 --> 0:30:41,14
our economic paradigm right now.


648
0:30:41,14 --> 0:30:43,83
How do we get knowledge about what needs are - that


649
0:30:43,83 --> 0:30:47,79
what we know how to do might be able to fulfill,


650
0:30:47,79 --> 0:30:51,41
if we don't in fact have an experience with that need. Right.


651
0:30:51,41 --> 0:30:56,36
It's not part of our - the thing we've ever dealt with in our lives.


652
0:30:56,36 --> 0:30:58,59
So I think you're speaking to the converted already.


653
0:30:58,59 --> 0:31:1,83
How many of you have visited Africa?


654
0:31:1,83 --> 0:31:6,4
Raise your hand. How many of you have been to the Middle East?


655
0:31:6,4 --> 0:31:7,86
How many of you have been to either China,


656
0:31:7,86 --> 0:31:11,98
India or somewhere in the South Pacific?


657
0:31:11,98 --> 0:31:13,96
We're solving the problem because people


658
0:31:13,96 --> 0:31:15,54
are learning about these challenges.


659
0:31:15,54 --> 0:31:18,9
And we have to take it very seriously.


660
0:31:18,9 --> 0:31:22,76
How many of you are actually doing projects


661
0:31:22,76 --> 0:31:26,7
in areas outside of the U.S.?


662
0:31:26,7 --> 0:31:28,65
That's the pattern I want to see.


663
0:31:28,65 --> 0:31:31,95
It's not tourism, it's not about the Peace Corps going for six months,


664
0:31:31,95 --> 0:31:33,43
it's about doing something. Right?


665
0:31:33,43 --> 0:31:36,3
And that's why I am in the entrepreneurship business


666
0:31:36,3 --> 0:31:40,58
because entrepreneurship is about doing something. Hey, good to see.


667
0:31:40,58 --> 0:31:45,13
Any other questions? Let me move on, feel free to throw it out.


668
0:31:45,13 --> 0:31:47,7
So align exit goals.


669
0:31:47,7 --> 0:31:50,91
There is a big piece of this - to build to sell or build to last.


670
0:31:50,91 --> 0:31:52,27
You have to find the partners that are going


671
0:31:52,27 --> 0:31:54,79
to allow you to do what you want to do.


672
0:31:54,79 --> 0:31:57,53
Some of you are looking to build durable opportunities that


673
0:31:57,53 --> 0:32:0,96
are actually going to solve world problems and be persistent


674
0:32:0,96 --> 0:32:2,58
and actually - and that's the built to last kind of thing.


675
0:32:2,58 --> 0:32:4,53
Isn't it kind of ironic that they are two books out there,


676
0:32:4,53 --> 0:32:6,15
Built to Sell and Built to Last.


677
0:32:6,15 --> 0:32:9,19
Jim Collins is the one that everyone knows and then


678
0:32:9,19 --> 0:32:11,9
John Warrillow on the - went on the Built to Sell side.


679
0:32:11,9 --> 0:32:13,12
These are different mentalities.


680
0:32:13,12 --> 0:32:16,5
You have to think through how do you align the strategies


681
0:32:16,5 --> 0:32:18,56
to get done what you want to have accomplished. Right?


682
0:32:18,56 --> 0:32:21,23
I am not so concerned about the exit


683
0:32:21,23 --> 0:32:22,97
as I am about the sustainability,


684
0:32:22,97 --> 0:32:26,31
the opportunity and meeting the need long-term.


685
0:32:26,31 --> 0:32:29,34
Stay persistent to meet that need.


686
0:32:29,34 --> 0:32:30,96
And then lastly, I am going to spend the balance of my


687
0:32:30,96 --> 0:32:33,75
time with you all today on this concept of deal makers,


688
0:32:33,75 --> 0:32:36,95
the syndicate and it starts kind of with this idea.


689
0:32:36,95 --> 0:32:39,78
You've seen LinkSV here in Silicon Valley for instance and


690
0:32:39,78 --> 0:32:42,31
all the big influencers of venture capital industry and how


691
0:32:42,31 --> 0:32:44,69
that operates with all the companies that they've helped to


692
0:32:44,69 --> 0:32:48,51
support here and now has become I think a global phenomena.


693
0:32:48,51 --> 0:32:51,1
It's very interesting time to be in the entrepreneurship


694
0:32:51,1 --> 0:32:55,596
business and this is the world's epicenter.


695
0:32:55,596 --> 0:32:57,1
It occurs to me you all have to think through


696
0:32:57,1 --> 0:32:58,91
how do you bring these people in your life?


697
0:32:58,91 --> 0:33:0,1
How do you actually find them?


698
0:33:0,1 --> 0:33:1,89
How do you bring them into your vision?


699
0:33:1,89 --> 0:33:4,89
And how do you leverage them to take full


700
0:33:4,89 --> 0:33:7,1
advantage of the potential that you see.


701
0:33:7,1 --> 0:33:8,69
We can spend a lot of time there.


702
0:33:8,69 --> 0:33:10,76
So let me summarize the first part of this.


703
0:33:10,76 --> 0:33:12,7
So here's the big formula. Right?


704
0:33:12,7 --> 0:33:15,83
Starts with the idea, then you add the need,


705
0:33:15,83 --> 0:33:18,98
then you add understanding of a leapfrog strategy,


706
0:33:18,98 --> 0:33:21,48
add to that a business model that's graceful.


707
0:33:21,48 --> 0:33:24,69
You have recurring durable revenue model.


708
0:33:24,69 --> 0:33:26,98
You align exit opportunities.


709
0:33:26,98 --> 0:33:31,34
You fuse that with a killer syndicatable dealmaker network.


710
0:33:31,34 --> 0:33:34,93
That's going to add up to a whole bunch of money. Right?


711
0:33:34,93 --> 0:33:37,2
You won't find this in any Stanford textbook,


712
0:33:37,2 --> 0:33:39,72
I don't believe but I honestly think that those are some


713
0:33:39,72 --> 0:33:42,526
of the key elements that you should be thinking about.


714
0:33:42,526 --> 0:33:46,88
I am going to spend a little time here.


715
0:33:46,88 --> 0:33:51,11
And how I'm doing in time, Tom? Am I over?


716
0:33:51,11 --> 0:33:56,71
No. Okay. Thank you.


717
0:33:56,71 --> 0:33:57,44
So we are going to spend some time on networking.


718
0:33:57,44 --> 0:33:59,32
I wanted to share with you a few ideas.


719
0:33:59,32 --> 0:34:0,85
Question two, what makes Silicon Valley the


720
0:34:0,85 --> 0:34:3,43
best place on earth to be an entrepreneur.


721
0:34:3,43 --> 0:34:7,76
So you are very fortunate and if you think about all


722
0:34:7,76 --> 0:34:9,85
the various ways the Silicon Valley plays a role.


723
0:34:9,85 --> 0:34:12,2
Why is Silicon Valley so successful?


724
0:34:12,2 --> 0:34:16,15
Obviously, there is a set of theories, it's about innovation. Right?


725
0:34:16,15 --> 0:34:17,68
There's even concepts of spillovers.


726
0:34:17,68 --> 0:34:20,66
There is so much innovation that spills over into entrepreneurial


727
0:34:20,66 --> 0:34:22,95
ventures that kind of catch them like vessels.


728
0:34:22,95 --> 0:34:26,23
Right? I'm not so sure but that's one theory.


729
0:34:26,23 --> 0:34:28,1
Second reason is there's piles of cash here.


730
0:34:28,1 --> 0:34:30,27
A lot of venture capital money. Right?


731
0:34:30,27 --> 0:34:32,89
People are thinking all those two ingredients kind of come together.


732
0:34:32,89 --> 0:34:36,23
Mix ideas, put them with a bunch of money, things happen.


733
0:34:36,23 --> 0:34:37,38
Well, we know better.


734
0:34:37,38 --> 0:34:41,13
Usually it boils down to PO and VCs aren't heroes,


735
0:34:41,13 --> 0:34:43,8
ultimately, but they are going to be


736
0:34:43,8 --> 0:34:47,7
an important key to this ecosystem.


737
0:34:47,7 --> 0:34:49,27
Then you think about and a lot of my friends who are entrepreneurs


738
0:34:49,27 --> 0:34:51,64
think about that Ocean's Eleven kind of management team,


739
0:34:51,64 --> 0:34:53,21
the killer entrepreneurs,


740
0:34:53,21 --> 0:34:55,68
a combination of teams that are really going to make it happen.


741
0:34:55,68 --> 0:34:58,63
That's an important ingredient, right.


742
0:34:58,63 --> 0:34:59,43
And it occurs to me,


743
0:34:59,43 --> 0:35:3,43
again, the generation kind of thing happens for me.


744
0:35:3,43 --> 0:35:6,1
This is the Ocean's Eleven of the old days.


745
0:35:6,1 --> 0:35:8,3
Always wondered why - why is there twelve of these


746
0:35:8,3 --> 0:35:9,96
guys and this guy I think was sneaking in,


747
0:35:9,96 --> 0:35:13,61
I am not sure who that guy is, but it's fascinating to me.


748
0:35:13,61 --> 0:35:15,12
That Ocean's Eleven piece is there,


749
0:35:15,12 --> 0:35:18,7
but when I was on that plane going to Europe,


750
0:35:18,7 --> 0:35:22,65
I ran out of juice in my battery and I ran across


751
0:35:22,65 --> 0:35:24,33
the only thing that there was to read.


752
0:35:24,33 --> 0:35:27,23
I couldn't sleep, I came across the airline magazine


753
0:35:27,23 --> 0:35:30,62
and in the airline magazine there is maybe one piece


754
0:35:30,62 --> 0:35:32,41
of information you want in that thing.


755
0:35:32,41 --> 0:35:33,83
There was a very interesting article


756
0:35:33,83 --> 0:35:36,96
about mapping the Internet, right. You've seen all this before.


757
0:35:36,96 --> 0:35:38,26
You realize that's the first drawing


758
0:35:38,26 --> 0:35:40,69
of the predecessor of the Internet, it's called the ARPANET.


759
0:35:40,69 --> 0:35:45,6
So, array of four computers that were done originally for military.


760
0:35:45,6 --> 0:35:46,88
Well, then they showed the Internet2 mapping


761
0:35:46,88 --> 0:35:50,14
project and you've seen this map before.


762
0:35:50,14 --> 0:35:53,43
And these are all the computers that are arrayed in the international


763
0:35:53,43 --> 0:35:56,64
networks that are available on the Internet.


764
0:35:56,64 --> 0:36:0,41
When I looked at that picture, I didn't see information intensity;


765
0:36:0,41 --> 0:36:3,3
I saw a business model opportunity.


766
0:36:3,3 --> 0:36:5,99
I saw an opportunity for you all to conceive of ventures


767
0:36:5,99 --> 0:36:8,45
that truly do embrace a global solution.


768
0:36:8,45 --> 0:36:10,9
Getting back to the question that you had;


769
0:36:10,9 --> 0:36:14,6
we can use this tool to reach the whole world,


770
0:36:14,6 --> 0:36:16,33
right, and that we are in many ways.


771
0:36:16,33 --> 0:36:18,32
We were talking about Moore's Law


772
0:36:18,32 --> 0:36:23,49
15 years ago and now we are living it. You know, think about it.


773
0:36:23,49 --> 0:36:26,29
It occurs to me though when I get to the end of that magazine,


774
0:36:26,29 --> 0:36:28,72
I was flying on some airline, Continental or something,


775
0:36:28,72 --> 0:36:30,5
these are the five airlines that fly in the U.S.


776
0:36:30,5 --> 0:36:32,81
and then here is the global picture, right.


777
0:36:32,81 --> 0:36:35,28
Oops - and look at the nodes here, look at the nodes.


778
0:36:35,28 --> 0:36:37,41
It occurred to me, we're just as physically connected


779
0:36:37,41 --> 0:36:41,15
as we are connected through digital source, right.


780
0:36:41,15 --> 0:36:43,48
So this has huge implications on you as you


781
0:36:43,48 --> 0:36:46,26
think about your careers and your futures.


782
0:36:46,26 --> 0:36:49,22
You are now world citizens. You are now world entrepreneurs.


783
0:36:49,22 --> 0:36:51,49
This whole idea of global entrepreneurship is taking a


784
0:36:51,49 --> 0:36:57,19
lot of - getting a lot of attention now, absolutely true.


785
0:36:57,19 --> 0:37:1,93
Curious, how many of you are doing ventures right now?


786
0:37:1,93 --> 0:37:3,81
How many of you have a venture you are working on right now?


787
0:37:3,81 --> 0:37:5,52
Extraordinary.


788
0:37:5,52 --> 0:37:10,17
How many of you started your venture not in the United States?


789
0:37:10,17 --> 0:37:12,75
I love that, super.


790
0:37:12,75 --> 0:37:15,23
Okay, entrepreneurship is a global phenomenon,


791
0:37:15,23 --> 0:37:17,28
by the way, I think you already know that.


792
0:37:17,28 --> 0:37:20,56
So I've done a little work on looking at dealmakers and I wanted


793
0:37:20,56 --> 0:37:23,46
to understand kind of the nature of networking and the new frontiers


794
0:37:23,46 --> 0:37:27,82
that I think are coming between applying network theory and understanding


795
0:37:27,82 --> 0:37:30,75
the structure of social capital and understanding innovation from


796
0:37:30,75 --> 0:37:34,52
the standpoint of how firms ultimately take route.


797
0:37:34,52 --> 0:37:37,19
And I did little work on this and it occurred to me


798
0:37:37,19 --> 0:37:39,7
in the academic literature there was a real clear


799
0:37:39,7 --> 0:37:41,87
distinction between entrepreneurs and investors.


800
0:37:41,87 --> 0:37:43,93
Never understood that distinction because the successful


801
0:37:43,93 --> 0:37:46,58
entrepreneurs I knew were investors, right.


802
0:37:46,58 --> 0:37:49,56
There is no clear bright line between those two.


803
0:37:49,56 --> 0:37:51,56
So I always wondered there was these other people up there


804
0:37:51,56 --> 0:37:54,8
that kind of fuse those two concepts and they tended to


805
0:37:54,8 --> 0:37:56,46
be the people that made more and more things happen.


806
0:37:56,46 --> 0:37:57,89
You might have started as an entrepreneur,


807
0:37:57,89 --> 0:38:1,68
might have started as an investor but you become something else.


808
0:38:1,68 --> 0:38:2,83
I don't know, for the lack of a better word,


809
0:38:2,83 --> 0:38:4,14
I am looking for a better word for those


810
0:38:4,14 --> 0:38:6,36
of you trying to think about this.


811
0:38:6,36 --> 0:38:9,58
The dealmakers, the people that actually make things happen.


812
0:38:9,58 --> 0:38:10,91
And I tried to understand that.


813
0:38:10,91 --> 0:38:12,26
They broker resources,


814
0:38:12,26 --> 0:38:15,63
they shape your networks and they syndicate and interconnect, right.


815
0:38:15,63 --> 0:38:17,35
It occurs to me that there are these people in the


816
0:38:17,35 --> 0:38:21,27
center that activate the rest of the network, when it works, right.


817
0:38:21,27 --> 0:38:23,45
And these are the people that I was starting to get interested in.


818
0:38:23,45 --> 0:38:25,14
I remember about five years ago when the


819
0:38:25,14 --> 0:38:27,21
economy was starting to climb to a halt,


820
0:38:27,21 --> 0:38:30,58
it was grinding to a halt, I wanted to get something going.


821
0:38:30,58 --> 0:38:33,66
And I was thinking to myself who do we need.


822
0:38:33,66 --> 0:38:35,71
We need the people who have done it repeatedly.


823
0:38:35,71 --> 0:38:37,85
We might call them serial entrepreneurs,


824
0:38:37,85 --> 0:38:39,89
you might call them the people who ultimately


825
0:38:39,89 --> 0:38:41,98
broker deals or what have you.


826
0:38:41,98 --> 0:38:44,44
These are the individuals that are going to help us make it happen.


827
0:38:44,44 --> 0:38:46,82
For some reason, they're frozen. They are not doing it anymore.


828
0:38:46,82 --> 0:38:50,27
Why is that? They're living in kind of a fear.


829
0:38:50,27 --> 0:38:54,35
So I said, let's figure out something, so I developed this algorithm,


830
0:38:54,35 --> 0:38:56,28
I guess, it's for lack of - it's a vaunted


831
0:38:56,28 --> 0:38:57,35
term to call it an algorithm.


832
0:38:57,35 --> 0:39:0,32
The truth of the matter is, I'm looking for people who have multiple


833
0:39:0,32 --> 0:39:4,17
positions in entrepreneurial firms, I'm actually stacking them up,


834
0:39:4,17 --> 0:39:6,42
and then I relate them socially to try to understand


835
0:39:6,42 --> 0:39:8,4
how they're connected to one another.


836
0:39:8,4 --> 0:39:11,22
Because I want you as young entrepreneurs to be able to access them,


837
0:39:11,22 --> 0:39:14,4
right, because that's how you're going to be successful.


838
0:39:14,4 --> 0:39:15,9
So finding out who the who is.


839
0:39:15,9 --> 0:39:18,53
The way I do that is I try to understand the entrepreneurs


840
0:39:18,53 --> 0:39:20,16
and investors and generally there are distinctions


841
0:39:20,16 --> 0:39:21,42
between those two types of people.


842
0:39:21,42 --> 0:39:25,7
But as they move up in their career, they have two equity positions,


843
0:39:25,7 --> 0:39:28,4
three equity positions, four equity positions in firms,


844
0:39:28,4 --> 0:39:31,4
they become more and more important in seeing


845
0:39:31,4 --> 0:39:33,85
the network kind of come to life, right.


846
0:39:33,85 --> 0:39:35,45
So I'm looking at actors within firms,


847
0:39:35,45 --> 0:39:39,34
within regions using interlocks, very interested in this.


848
0:39:39,34 --> 0:39:42,31
It occurred to me, I looked at all the tech hotspots and


849
0:39:42,31 --> 0:39:45,6
back in the '80s we actually had a whole set of theories


850
0:39:45,6 --> 0:39:47,15
where if we brought all the technologies together,


851
0:39:47,15 --> 0:39:49,9
entrepreneurship would happen, right.


852
0:39:49,9 --> 0:39:51,9
And this is a chart that shows the number of firms born


853
0:39:51,9 --> 0:39:54,24
and it was fascinating to me that when I looked at it,


854
0:39:54,24 --> 0:39:56,19
Silicon Valley created almost 5,000


855
0:39:56,19 --> 0:39:58,9
firms over a 20 year period whereas Boston created about


856
0:39:58,9 --> 0:40:1,86
half that even though in most cases you're equating


857
0:40:1,86 --> 0:40:5,48
Silicon Valley and Boston as equal parties in entrepreneurship.


858
0:40:5,48 --> 0:40:7,72
All these other technology regions including my region,


859
0:40:7,72 --> 0:40:11,75
Research Triangle Park, created less than 1,000, right.


860
0:40:11,75 --> 0:40:14,16
Ironically where I come from Research Triangle Park has the highest


861
0:40:14,16 --> 0:40:18,54
density of PhDs over total employees of anywhere in the world.


862
0:40:18,54 --> 0:40:20,41
Yet, they're not creating that many companies.


863
0:40:20,41 --> 0:40:23,8
So I was trying to figure that out.


864
0:40:23,8 --> 0:40:24,75
When I looked at these patterns,


865
0:40:24,75 --> 0:40:26,13
these are the number of equity positions


866
0:40:26,13 --> 0:40:30,21
held and you see the numbers on the left, 1 all the way to 30,


867
0:40:30,21 --> 0:40:32,43
these are the equity positions by each of these regions.


868
0:40:32,43 --> 0:40:35,33
And I noticed there was a big fat base


869
0:40:35,33 --> 0:40:37,5
wherever there was nice economies,


870
0:40:37,5 --> 0:40:38,78
where Silicon Valley was performing


871
0:40:38,78 --> 0:40:40,49
so well in creating great companies,


872
0:40:40,49 --> 0:40:42,85
had a lot of entrepreneurs and investors engaged in it.


873
0:40:42,85 --> 0:40:44,77
Okay, we already kind of knew that,


874
0:40:44,77 --> 0:40:46,74
but the other pattern I saw on the data that I thought was really


875
0:40:46,74 --> 0:40:49,77
interesting was there was a really nice fat long tail.


876
0:40:49,77 --> 0:40:53,36
There were a lot of people who did a lot of things, right.


877
0:40:53,36 --> 0:40:57,12
Whereas these other regions you never saw those people, right.


878
0:40:57,12 --> 0:41:0,91
So I started to look at the relationship of dealmakers to the


879
0:41:0,91 --> 0:41:4,18
performance of regions by way of creating new companies.


880
0:41:4,18 --> 0:41:6,46
And I founded as a matter of fact,


881
0:41:6,46 --> 0:41:10,39
statistically the presence of dealmakers was actually


882
0:41:10,39 --> 0:41:14,62
more correlated to firm birth than the frequency of


883
0:41:14,62 --> 0:41:17,6
the availability of entrepreneurs and investors.


884
0:41:17,6 --> 0:41:21,15
So what does it tell you? It occurs to me, that these people are


885
0:41:21,15 --> 0:41:24,9
usually in the elite, the top 2.7%,


886
0:41:24,9 --> 0:41:27,8
these are people who have three or more equity


887
0:41:27,8 --> 0:41:29,16
positions in entrepreneurial firms.


888
0:41:29,16 --> 0:41:32,25
And in places like the Bay Area, it's 4.5%


889
0:41:32,25 --> 0:41:34,49
of the population, whereas places like


890
0:41:34,49 --> 0:41:38,65
Austin, Texas or Denver, it's around 1%, right.


891
0:41:38,65 --> 0:41:41,65
So something is in the water here, right.


892
0:41:41,65 --> 0:41:43,7
It occurs to me, these are the people.


893
0:41:43,7 --> 0:41:44,94
Well I wanted to map the networks and these are


894
0:41:44,94 --> 0:41:47,17
the networks of these 12 technology hotspots,


895
0:41:47,17 --> 0:41:49,85
as a matter of fact they're organized by population,


896
0:41:49,85 --> 0:41:53,6
so the most populous is Boston, the least populous is Austin,


897
0:41:53,6 --> 0:41:54,12
the lower right hand side.


898
0:41:54,12 --> 0:41:56,3
If it varied by population,


899
0:41:56,3 --> 0:41:59,38
you would expect to see the most dense to the least dense, correct?


900
0:41:59,38 --> 0:42:2,3
What do you see in the pattern of this data?


901
0:42:2,3 --> 0:42:6,91
You see the most dense or the most intense


902
0:42:6,91 --> 0:42:9,5
entrepreneurial network in Silicon Valley.


903
0:42:9,5 --> 0:42:11,66
The third greatest - largest metropolitan area up here


904
0:42:11,66 --> 0:42:13,73
Phoenix has the weakest entrepreneurial network.


905
0:42:13,73 --> 0:42:15,44
I was talking to Michael Crow,


906
0:42:15,44 --> 0:42:16,96
the Chancellor of Arizona State University,


907
0:42:16,96 --> 0:42:19,24
shown this data, and he said Zoller, how many people are up there?


908
0:42:19,24 --> 0:42:23,47
And I said about 150 and he said, I'll just have them over the house.


909
0:42:23,47 --> 0:42:25,63
I want to talk to these guys.


910
0:42:25,63 --> 0:42:29,4
Well, in places like RTP or Austin or places like that,


911
0:42:29,4 --> 0:42:32,32
they hang in there even though they're small places.


912
0:42:32,32 --> 0:42:34,12
Please, question?


913
0:42:34,12 --> 0:42:38,8
Okay, the data comes ultimately from private transaction data.


914
0:42:38,8 --> 0:42:42,51
It comes from public databases, like Standard & Poor's.


915
0:42:42,51 --> 0:42:45,77
And I came up with the software to actually put all


916
0:42:45,77 --> 0:42:49,41
the data together and then socially relate it.


917
0:42:49,41 --> 0:42:51,6
Well, what was fascinating is,


918
0:42:51,6 --> 0:42:53,44
this is the aggregate network of entrepreneurs


919
0:42:53,44 --> 0:42:55,1
in each of these regions. What does that tell you?


920
0:42:55,1 --> 0:42:57,66
What two regions other than Silicon Valley and Boston would you


921
0:42:57,66 --> 0:43:1,49
say are starting to look like hot entrepreneurial networks?


922
0:43:1,49 --> 0:43:4,14
San Diego. San Diego and Seattle, right.


923
0:43:4,14 --> 0:43:6,46
Now I'm leaving out some obvious cities because


924
0:43:6,46 --> 0:43:8,74
these are technology hotspots, right?


925
0:43:8,74 --> 0:43:11,16
Leaving out some of the key metropolitan areas


926
0:43:11,16 --> 0:43:15,23
like Los Angeles or New York or Chicago, starting to study those.


927
0:43:15,23 --> 0:43:17,23
What's ironic is many of those cities because they're


928
0:43:17,23 --> 0:43:19,93
financial headquarters tend not to be entrepreneurial.


929
0:43:19,93 --> 0:43:22,6
But you know the stories that are evolving.


930
0:43:22,6 --> 0:43:24,73
The Groupon founders are really driving an


931
0:43:24,73 --> 0:43:26,78
entrepreneurial revolution in Chicago.


932
0:43:26,78 --> 0:43:29,73
Have you all noticed what's happening in New York lately,


933
0:43:29,73 --> 0:43:31,67
across the bridge in Brooklyn?


934
0:43:31,67 --> 0:43:33,9
It's unbelievable, there's an entrepreneurial


935
0:43:33,9 --> 0:43:34,52
revolution going on there.


936
0:43:34,52 --> 0:43:36,77
But the aggregate networks are just one story.


937
0:43:36,77 --> 0:43:39,88
I want to know where the dealmakers are? Well, check this out.


938
0:43:39,88 --> 0:43:41,58
When you screen the aggregate network


939
0:43:41,58 --> 0:43:45,86
for three or more equity positions, this is the picture you get.


940
0:43:45,86 --> 0:43:47,78
Silicon Valley, you would still need the Stanford


941
0:43:47,78 --> 0:43:50,33
Football Stadium to have everybody there, right.


942
0:43:50,33 --> 0:43:53,66
Boston, you could probably fit them in the Stanford Basketball Arena.


943
0:43:53,66 --> 0:43:58,1
Whereas in Austin, you could probably get them in this room, right.


944
0:43:58,1 --> 0:43:59,49
In Phoenix, you could probably get them in


945
0:43:59,49 --> 0:44:2,27
the classroom we're going next, right.


946
0:44:2,27 --> 0:44:4,4
When you go to four plus dealmakers look at this.


947
0:44:4,4 --> 0:44:7,43
You would still need the basketball stadium


948
0:44:7,43 --> 0:44:9,96
here in time for Silicon Valley,


949
0:44:9,96 --> 0:44:12,73
whereas in Boston you could probably get them in this room.


950
0:44:12,73 --> 0:44:13,55
And the people in Phoenix,


951
0:44:13,55 --> 0:44:16,5
you could probably get them in the front row,


952
0:44:16,5 --> 0:44:17,68
pretty interesting, isn't it?


953
0:44:17,68 --> 0:44:20,37
Things aren't all equal when we are looking


954
0:44:20,37 --> 0:44:23,78
at the performance of regions. So... Excuse me. Yes?


955
0:44:23,78 --> 0:44:26,72
Did you do anything overseas or is this just relative to U.S.?


956
0:44:26,72 --> 0:44:28,95
I just finished a project with the OECD in Europe.


957
0:44:28,95 --> 0:44:30,83
We are looking at all the European headquarters,


958
0:44:30,83 --> 0:44:33,79
all the headquarter cities. And we are using this as a way to measure


959
0:44:33,79 --> 0:44:36,3
kind of the performance of networks.


960
0:44:36,3 --> 0:44:38,83
But I want to do it in Southeast Asia and I just


961
0:44:38,83 --> 0:44:40,7
met with a group here in Stanford because many of


962
0:44:40,7 --> 0:44:43,5
the leaders who came up with these methodologies,


963
0:44:43,5 --> 0:44:49,3
I studied under more or less, so the assets are here.


964
0:44:49,3 --> 0:44:51,61
Okay. So what does this mean to you?


965
0:44:51,61 --> 0:44:52,82
How do I take fullest advantage of my


966
0:44:52,82 --> 0:44:54,13
time in Stanford to gain an edge,


967
0:44:54,13 --> 0:44:56,51
and I want to use the last 12 minutes with


968
0:44:56,51 --> 0:45:0,4
you guys to kind of answer that question.


969
0:45:0,4 --> 0:45:4,52
Recognize in Silicon Valley you've got an extraordinary situation.


970
0:45:4,52 --> 0:45:8,53
This is Research Triangle Park, their entrepreneurial network.


971
0:45:8,53 --> 0:45:10,27
All the colors represent the various industries.


972
0:45:10,27 --> 0:45:12,26
Red is biotech, blue is software and IT,


973
0:45:12,26 --> 0:45:15,35
green is industrials, orange is energy.


974
0:45:15,35 --> 0:45:16,6
The circles are the investors.


975
0:45:16,6 --> 0:45:18,86
The triangles are the entrepreneurs, they're all connected.


976
0:45:18,86 --> 0:45:20,65
It looks like a really rich entrepreneurial


977
0:45:20,65 --> 0:45:21,84
network in Research Triangle Park.


978
0:45:21,84 --> 0:45:25,21
Let me show you the equivalent in Silicon Valley.


979
0:45:25,21 --> 0:45:27,9
That's the equivalent.


980
0:45:27,9 --> 0:45:30,34
That's ridiculous, I mean truly ridiculous. Okay.


981
0:45:30,34 --> 0:45:34,62
Now let's start screening that big hairball. Let's go to 2-plus.


982
0:45:34,62 --> 0:45:36,25
This is what you got with 2-plus.


983
0:45:36,25 --> 0:45:39,5
All these people are serial investors and entrepreneurs.


984
0:45:39,5 --> 0:45:41,87
Let's go to 3-plus.


985
0:45:41,87 --> 0:45:43,76
Look what it's starting to look like, you can start to see it.


986
0:45:43,76 --> 0:45:49,1
That's 10-plus, I am sorry, it's ridiculous. Let's go to 15, right?


987
0:45:49,1 --> 0:45:52,9
Now you're starting to see something, lot of patterns.


988
0:45:52,9 --> 0:45:59,47
What color is dominant? Blue - all internet, IT, software; fascinating.


989
0:45:59,47 --> 0:46:1,17
There's some biotech.


990
0:46:1,17 --> 0:46:2,7
The circles are the big investors,


991
0:46:2,7 --> 0:46:4,76
the triangles are the big entrepreneurs, right?


992
0:46:4,76 --> 0:46:6,25
And I'll track back at their history,


993
0:46:6,25 --> 0:46:10,21
look at their operating history. Let's go to 20-plus;


994
0:46:10,21 --> 0:46:11,67
these are the dealmakers now.


995
0:46:11,67 --> 0:46:15,47
And do you see any other color, but blue? Fascinating, isn't it?


996
0:46:15,47 --> 0:46:17,27
These are all the mega dealmakers here.


997
0:46:17,27 --> 0:46:20,8
There are 44 mega dealmaker investors with over 20


998
0:46:20,8 --> 0:46:24,36
equity positions in entrepreneurial companies, 16 mega entrepreneurs.


999
0:46:24,36 --> 0:46:27,9
And honestly working between investors and entrepreneurs


1000
0:46:27,9 --> 0:46:28,73
at this level is very interesting and these are the


1001
0:46:28,73 --> 0:46:32,19
types of people that you read about, right?


1002
0:46:32,19 --> 0:46:36,79
You can touch these people. How do you touch these people?


1003
0:46:36,79 --> 0:46:39,9
These people are not on your Facebook, right? Some of them are.


1004
0:46:39,9 --> 0:46:43,4
Not all of them. You know, we have to think about that.


1005
0:46:43,4 --> 0:46:45,23
Many of you are connected socially, right?


1006
0:46:45,23 --> 0:46:47,43
A lot of you feel like you're really connected


1007
0:46:47,43 --> 0:46:48,38
socially, you're doing well.


1008
0:46:48,38 --> 0:46:51,2
How many of you have over 200 contacts,


1009
0:46:51,2 --> 0:46:52,91
or connections in either Facebook or


1010
0:46:52,91 --> 0:46:54,42
LinkedIn or whatever you're using?


1011
0:46:54,42 --> 0:47:5,46
200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1,000,


1012
0:47:5,46 --> 0:47:12,68
over 1,500, over 2,000, okay? Interesting, isn't it?


1013
0:47:12,68 --> 0:47:14,61
You have to connect to the right people.


1014
0:47:14,61 --> 0:47:17,33
And let me tell you, your life is going to be defined by


1015
0:47:17,33 --> 0:47:20,0
five key connections in your life.


1016
0:47:20,0 --> 0:47:21,62
Five key connections are going to make the difference


1017
0:47:21,62 --> 0:47:24,13
between you being successful or not.


1018
0:47:24,13 --> 0:47:28,96
So, be aware that, you know, Facebook might be the new world order.


1019
0:47:28,96 --> 0:47:32,45
But you have to connect to the people who are doing this work.


1020
0:47:32,45 --> 0:47:37,59
And honestly, this problem is a big challenge, right?


1021
0:47:37,59 --> 0:47:40,3
We've got a big problem because there's the Facebook


1022
0:47:40,3 --> 0:47:43,9
generation and those like me, who are not.


1023
0:47:43,9 --> 0:47:47,74
Don't leave us behind because guess what?


1024
0:47:47,74 --> 0:47:52,64
We still have the keys, you know? Don't you want to take the car out?


1025
0:47:52,64 --> 0:47:55,22
So, be aware of that challenge and make


1026
0:47:55,22 --> 0:47:57,1
sure that you work with us, right?


1027
0:47:57,1 --> 0:48:2,53
Because oldsters are still relevant and we don't get it, you know?


1028
0:48:2,53 --> 0:48:4,6
It's important for us to think about.


1029
0:48:4,6 --> 0:48:8,77
Turn this into your advantage, make this possible, okay?


1030
0:48:8,77 --> 0:48:12,38
What path will lead to my success, I'm going to do this very quickly.


1031
0:48:12,38 --> 0:48:14,9
I did analysis of all the dealmaker pathways,


1032
0:48:14,9 --> 0:48:16,25
and there were bunch of different pathways


1033
0:48:16,25 --> 0:48:17,33
and I'm going to just interpret this,


1034
0:48:17,33 --> 0:48:19,43
this is the hand waving portion.


1035
0:48:19,43 --> 0:48:21,16
I thought for sure most of the people who're really


1036
0:48:21,16 --> 0:48:23,23
successful will start out in investment banking,


1037
0:48:23,23 --> 0:48:24,13
go to business school,


1038
0:48:24,13 --> 0:48:26,89
go to the investment banking world and come back to - get


1039
0:48:26,89 --> 0:48:28,99
their MBA and then get into private equity or get into


1040
0:48:28,99 --> 0:48:31,71
venture capital and become mega financial guys.


1041
0:48:31,71 --> 0:48:33,82
Those are the guys, that's the pathway in the top.


1042
0:48:33,82 --> 0:48:35,32
Then I thought the other pathway would be,


1043
0:48:35,32 --> 0:48:36,31
the person who starts a company,


1044
0:48:36,31 --> 0:48:38,12
then who he starts the second company, who starts the third company,


1045
0:48:38,12 --> 0:48:41,13
serial entrepreneur, that's the pathway at the bottom.


1046
0:48:41,13 --> 0:48:42,79
Then I saw all these other pathways when I was


1047
0:48:42,79 --> 0:48:44,92
studying their backgrounds and it was like, who are these people?


1048
0:48:44,92 --> 0:48:46,51
These are the guys who go to corporations,


1049
0:48:46,51 --> 0:48:49,2
they start working for large companies and then they,


1050
0:48:49,2 --> 0:48:51,34
ironically, as they get senior in their career start


1051
0:48:51,34 --> 0:48:54,13
working for smaller and smaller companies,


1052
0:48:54,13 --> 0:48:56,58
private equity-backed companies or high growth companies,


1053
0:48:56,58 --> 0:48:59,62
they left IBM to go work for some of the companies


1054
0:48:59,62 --> 0:49:2,26
you all admire in Silicon Valley,


1055
0:49:2,26 --> 0:49:3,8
while ironically there was a set of profiles


1056
0:49:3,8 --> 0:49:6,14
that came about by looking at this work.


1057
0:49:6,14 --> 0:49:9,34
And I did this really clever kind of pathway analysis and


1058
0:49:9,34 --> 0:49:12,5
based on that I looked at the centrality of the pathway,


1059
0:49:12,5 --> 0:49:14,18
and sure enough going and becoming a financial


1060
0:49:14,18 --> 0:49:19,41
engineer will lead you to become a dealmaker, but not most likely.


1061
0:49:19,41 --> 0:49:22,42
Being a serial entrepreneur will lead you to be a dealmaker,


1062
0:49:22,42 --> 0:49:26,5
but not most likely. What's the most likely path?


1063
0:49:26,5 --> 0:49:28,77
Getting to the C-suite of a large company


1064
0:49:28,77 --> 0:49:32,15
and then backing into a private company.


1065
0:49:32,15 --> 0:49:35,65
So what we've been saying is, go start a company.


1066
0:49:35,65 --> 0:49:38,14
It's not a bad idea to go work for a company


1067
0:49:38,14 --> 0:49:41,26
and then go fuel a company's growth.


1068
0:49:41,26 --> 0:49:43,89
Is that interesting? Please. Okay.


1069
0:49:43,89 --> 0:49:47,29
Can you cut out years by doing management consulting?


1070
0:49:47,29 --> 0:49:48,65
Well, I think consulting - as a matter of fact,


1071
0:49:48,65 --> 0:49:50,82
consulting is one of these pathways and there's -


1072
0:49:50,82 --> 0:49:52,38
it's actually a very common path.


1073
0:49:52,38 --> 0:49:56,51
This one right here is consulting and services company, so yes.


1074
0:49:56,51 --> 0:49:58,9
The answer is yes.


1075
0:49:58,9 --> 0:50:0,29
I wish it was definitive, but it was an interesting pattern,


1076
0:50:0,29 --> 0:50:2,5
I didn't - that surprised me.


1077
0:50:2,5 --> 0:50:5,97
So don't leave the idea of working for enterprises out.


1078
0:50:5,97 --> 0:50:9,75
I'm not saying go work for the big huge corporations necessarily,


1079
0:50:9,75 --> 0:50:12,89
but learn something that you can leverage ultimately


1080
0:50:12,89 --> 0:50:14,84
in the building of your of entrepreneurial career.


1081
0:50:14,84 --> 0:50:17,12
Okay, I'm going to finish up. Please.


1082
0:50:17,12 --> 0:50:19,17
What is the average timeframe you're looking at in the...


1083
0:50:19,17 --> 0:50:23,69
This is typically a 12-year path. 12-year.


1084
0:50:23,69 --> 0:50:24,96
We're going to finish up real quick


1085
0:50:24,96 --> 0:50:26,84
and then I'll open up to questions.


1086
0:50:26,84 --> 0:50:28,72
Why is the Stanford tuition bill worth it?


1087
0:50:28,72 --> 0:50:30,4
You can pass this on to your parents.


1088
0:50:30,4 --> 0:50:34,55
I did an analysis of all the dealmakers in all these 12 hotspots.


1089
0:50:34,55 --> 0:50:37,41
And those four lines represent four universities.


1090
0:50:37,41 --> 0:50:42,11
I'm sorry, I used red, crimson for Harvard, I apologize for that.


1091
0:50:42,11 --> 0:50:46,21
I used green for Stanford, I apologize because you have a tree,


1092
0:50:46,21 --> 0:50:49,23
that's my thinking.


1093
0:50:49,23 --> 0:50:54,66
Blue is the University of Pennsylvania and grey is MIT.


1094
0:50:54,66 --> 0:50:58,9
And in each of these regions, the top universities that yellow bar


1095
0:50:58,9 --> 0:51:0,43
are usually the local universities.


1096
0:51:0,43 --> 0:51:3,93
In Boston, it's Harvard; the Bay Area, it's Stanford;


1097
0:51:3,93 --> 0:51:5,42
in Phoenix, it's Arizona State;


1098
0:51:5,42 --> 0:51:7,1
in Seattle, it's University of Washington;


1099
0:51:7,1 --> 0:51:8,54
Minneapolis, it's University of Minnesota;


1100
0:51:8,54 --> 0:51:10,76
in Denver, it's University of Colorado Boulder;


1101
0:51:10,76 --> 0:51:14,9
in Orange County, California and it's Harvard, sorry about that.


1102
0:51:14,9 --> 0:51:16,29
In San Diego, it's Harvard, you got to fix that,


1103
0:51:16,29 --> 0:51:18,98
you got something else. And in Portland, it's Stanford;


1104
0:51:18,98 --> 0:51:21,17
in Salt Lake City, it's Brigham Young;


1105
0:51:21,17 --> 0:51:22,87
in Raleigh, it's University of North Carolina


1106
0:51:22,87 --> 0:51:25,54
at Chapel Hill - go Tar Heels - and Austin,


1107
0:51:25,54 --> 0:51:27,2
it's University of Texas at Austin.


1108
0:51:27,2 --> 0:51:30,0
However, in every single one of these regions,


1109
0:51:30,0 --> 0:51:33,7
those four universities are present among the dealmaker community.


1110
0:51:33,7 --> 0:51:35,79
That's the old social network.


1111
0:51:35,79 --> 0:51:38,3
Do you think you can use that as an advantage in your future?


1112
0:51:38,3 --> 0:51:41,7
And let me tell you where Stanford shows up,


1113
0:51:41,7 --> 0:51:45,51
in Boston number four, behind Northeastern, which is a local school,


1114
0:51:45,51 --> 0:51:48,39
in the Bay Area number one, in Phoenix number three,


1115
0:51:48,39 --> 0:51:52,36
behind Harvard, sorry, in Seattle number three, behind Harvard again,


1116
0:51:52,36 --> 0:51:55,56
Minneapolis, it's number four behind Harvard again;


1117
0:51:55,56 --> 0:51:58,45
Denver, it's number two ahead of Harvard,


1118
0:51:58,45 --> 0:52:2,35
alright, Denver, Orange County right below Harvard,


1119
0:52:2,35 --> 0:52:6,11
San Diego right below Harvard, Portland number one,


1120
0:52:6,11 --> 0:52:8,98
above Harvard, Salt Lake City number four,


1121
0:52:8,98 --> 0:52:13,33
behind Harvard, Raleigh behind NC State University, sorry, guys.


1122
0:52:13,33 --> 0:52:15,58
You need to come up to see us a little bit.


1123
0:52:15,58 --> 0:52:17,92
In Austin number three, right below Harvard,


1124
0:52:17,92 --> 0:52:19,67
let me tell you, you're just below Harvard


1125
0:52:19,67 --> 0:52:22,682
as being the most prominent university.


1126
0:52:22,682 --> 0:52:25,43
And I'll tell you another thing that this


1127
0:52:25,43 --> 0:52:27,22
is skewed towards financial engineering.


1128
0:52:27,22 --> 0:52:29,85
So if we took an entrepreneurial slice at this,


1129
0:52:29,85 --> 0:52:32,58
Stanford is going to be number one.


1130
0:52:32,58 --> 0:52:36,13
So, you could tell your parents that you're making this happen.


1131
0:52:36,13 --> 0:52:39,34
We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.


1132
0:52:39,34 --> 0:52:41,1
I think Winston Churchill said it right, right?


1133
0:52:41,1 --> 0:52:44,23
So, I'm going to leave the balance of the time open for questions.


1134
0:52:44,23 --> 0:52:53,43
How is that?


1135
0:52:53,43 --> 0:52:58,31
This is you by the way, this is the way I see you all, right?


1136
0:52:58,31 --> 0:53:1,9
So, what questions are out there? Please.


1137
0:53:1,9 --> 0:53:3,243
So, your analysis about dealmakers,


1138
0:53:3,243 --> 0:53:6,98
are you looking at just people who have equity stakes,


1139
0:53:6,98 --> 0:53:11,57
or are you doing some kind of score carding against people


1140
0:53:11,57 --> 0:53:18,41
who have investment stakes in successful entreneurships? Right.


1141
0:53:18,41 --> 0:53:20,36
So the question is when I do the dealmaker analysis,


1142
0:53:20,36 --> 0:53:22,89
am I just looking at equity positions or am I qualifying those


1143
0:53:22,89 --> 0:53:26,31
equity positions by determining the degree of success?


1144
0:53:26,31 --> 0:53:28,28
And the answer is it's the former.


1145
0:53:28,28 --> 0:53:30,68
And would it be better if I did the latter? Absolutely.


1146
0:53:30,68 --> 0:53:36,46
And I'm looking at those nuances as we speak.


1147
0:53:36,46 --> 0:53:37,67
Have you looked at clusters,


1148
0:53:37,67 --> 0:53:41,78
for example, the PayPal Mafia or the Association?


1149
0:53:41,78 --> 0:53:43,16
The syndication patterns,


1150
0:53:43,16 --> 0:53:46,43
this kind of group, there is no question that they exist and you


1151
0:53:46,43 --> 0:53:49,85
see that pattern continuously when you break down the model.


1152
0:53:49,85 --> 0:53:54,37
I think that that's the next thing. They actually operate as a band.


1153
0:53:54,37 --> 0:53:56,52
In many cases, those networks remain as they go


1154
0:53:56,52 --> 0:53:58,45
to the second deal or third deal or fourth deal.


1155
0:53:58,45 --> 0:54:1,76
When LinkedIn IPO'ed, everyone was following the folks who


1156
0:54:1,76 --> 0:54:3,74
were made into multimillionaires,


1157
0:54:3,74 --> 0:54:5,72
there is logic behind that because they actually


1158
0:54:5,72 --> 0:54:7,16
will bring things to life again.


1159
0:54:7,16 --> 0:54:12,485
 


1160
0:54:12,485 --> 0:54:16,389
Could you extrapolate from your data sort of how do you create


1161
0:54:16,389 --> 0:54:19,93
those 10% in the first place in emerging clusters? Yeah.


1162
0:54:19,93 --> 0:54:21,18
So, the question is,


1163
0:54:21,18 --> 0:54:23,73
is there a way that we could actually extrapolate based


1164
0:54:23,73 --> 0:54:26,7
on what we're seeing in the data to show how we could create


1165
0:54:26,7 --> 0:54:29,27
greater performance in those networks and how do we make


1166
0:54:29,27 --> 0:54:31,12
clusters better or how do you induce new clusters?


1167
0:54:31,12 --> 0:54:32,78
I think that's a science - well,


1168
0:54:32,78 --> 0:54:35,14
it's the art I think that's now unfolding.


1169
0:54:35,14 --> 0:54:37,34
We're trying to figure that out as matter of fact.


1170
0:54:37,34 --> 0:54:39,6
The Kauffman Foundation, as a matter of fact,


1171
0:54:39,6 --> 0:54:42,24
in four weeks, we're going to pick a city,


1172
0:54:42,24 --> 0:54:46,69
guess where Kauffman Foundation is located? Kansas City, Missouri.


1173
0:54:46,69 --> 0:54:48,24
We've mapped all the dealmakers,


1174
0:54:48,24 --> 0:54:49,86
we're bringing them in for one meeting,


1175
0:54:49,86 --> 0:54:52,18
they're all going to meet each other and we're going to actually


1176
0:54:52,18 --> 0:54:55,33
start understanding the roles and try to figure out how we can


1177
0:54:55,33 --> 0:54:58,79
actually build Kansas City into an entrepreneurial hotspot.


1178
0:54:58,79 --> 0:55:2,75
That will be one hell of an experiment, don't you think? Yeah.


1179
0:55:2,75 --> 0:55:4,97
Questions?


1180
0:55:4,97 --> 0:55:8,63
You talked a lot about the importance of expanding your network.


1181
0:55:8,63 --> 0:55:10,66
I think for a lot of us there's a tension


1182
0:55:10,66 --> 0:55:12,58
between doing that and being creative,


1183
0:55:12,58 --> 0:55:15,77
which often happens alone and without distraction.


1184
0:55:15,77 --> 0:55:18,78
I'm curious what advice you give to folks who struggle with that.


1185
0:55:18,78 --> 0:55:21,27
No, I think even the creative process,


1186
0:55:21,27 --> 0:55:24,91
and the question was - as a creative or someone who is innovative,


1187
0:55:24,91 --> 0:55:27,4
sometimes that's something you do independently,


1188
0:55:27,4 --> 0:55:29,12
you do alone, you don't necessarily have


1189
0:55:29,12 --> 0:55:32,13
to do it in a network type of phenomena.


1190
0:55:32,13 --> 0:55:34,8
But I would argue that once you've created,


1191
0:55:34,8 --> 0:55:38,39
it's nice to get the insight from others


1192
0:55:38,39 --> 0:55:42,69
and make those insights available, adapt your thinking.


1193
0:55:42,69 --> 0:55:45,23
I fall in love with these open source models where


1194
0:55:45,23 --> 0:55:48,45
people are starting to crowdsource solutions,


1195
0:55:48,45 --> 0:55:51,24
but I honestly do think that people who create typically


1196
0:55:51,24 --> 0:55:53,28
create based on independent ingenuity.


1197
0:55:53,28 --> 0:55:57,38
So, I think you're absolutely right, that's a critical tension.


1198
0:55:57,38 --> 0:56:0,33
The real question was should you err in one direction or the other?


1199
0:56:0,33 --> 0:56:1,8
I tend to think that people on the West Coast


1200
0:56:1,8 --> 0:56:4,8
tend to network and not independently create,


1201
0:56:4,8 --> 0:56:7,38
but honestly, you should create space.


1202
0:56:7,38 --> 0:56:9,98
You know I find that ultimately being involved


1203
0:56:9,98 --> 0:56:12,6
in trying to answer my e-mails every day,


1204
0:56:12,6 --> 0:56:14,88
it takes every bit of creative energy out of me,


1205
0:56:14,88 --> 0:56:17,26
honestly, to the extent that I just want to say,


1206
0:56:17,26 --> 0:56:20,55
I'm e-mail bankrupt, and give it up.


1207
0:56:20,55 --> 0:56:24,47
I'd rather do what I do, which is I like to create.


1208
0:56:24,47 --> 0:56:27,81
So, I understand - feel your pain. I think that... Yep, yep, yep.


1209
0:56:27,81 --> 0:58:27,81
Please give a round of applause. Thank you very much.
