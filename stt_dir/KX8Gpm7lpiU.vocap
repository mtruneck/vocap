###11 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: My mom would tell me a dream that she
###14 used to have when she was a little kid.
###16 She would dream that her dog died and that they buried it.
###20 And then, in the middle of the night, it would
###22 come back to life.
###23 Except it wasn't like it was when it was alive.
###25 It came back in a bunch of little pieces all
###28 put together wrong.
###30 That always scared the daylights out of me.
###32 
###36 This is my taxidermy shop, where all
###39 of the action happens.
###43 This is all the animals that I have in my freezer.
###47 Frozen red fox skin.
###49 I have several birds in here I'm going to practice on,
###51 since I don't do many birds yet.
###54 This is a skunk.
###55 This is actually going to be a kitten in a playful position.
###59 Here's some frozen squirrels.
###61 The mounted squirrels are a really good seller on eBay.
###64 If I need squirrels fast, I'll shoot
###66 them with a .410 shotgun.
###67 That makes it a lot faster to get squirrels.
###70 But you can shoot them with a .22 rifle as well.
###72 Just takes more skill.
###74 INTERVIEWER: So when did you begin to support yourself as a
###76 taxidermist?
###77 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Well, as soon as I started doing stuff
###80 for customers when I was 15, I realized I could
###83 put stuff on eBay.
###84 And from about age 16 on up, I was making a pretty good
###88 living selling stuff on eBay alone, in addition to the
###91 customer mounts I was getting in.
###93 INTERVIEWER: What did people your age think about it?
###96 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Like my friends?
###97 They thought it was interesting.
###99 They thought it was gross too.
###101 Most people, I just show the finished mount to.
###104 That way they could really appreciate the beauty.
###106 A lot of people can't handle the skinning--
###109 the behind the scenes.
###111 INTERVIEWER: And you were saying that you had some
###112 trouble with PETA when you were very young, right?
###114 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Yeah, I've gotten lots of hate mail from
###117 animal rights activists and people who just don't agree
###120 with killing animals in general.
###122 It's gone so far as to where they hacked into my website.
###125 They replaced the photo on my website with a photo of an
###130 aborted fetus.
###131 I think they were trying to say what I was doing to
###134 animals was as bad as doing that to a person, I guess they
###137 were trying to say.
###138 INTERVIEWER: So what are we going to do with
###140 this little guy here?
###141 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: This is a gray fox that we're going to
###142 be skinning today.
###144 And I'm going to show you how I turn him
###146 into a finished piece.
###149 I'm going to get the tools together that I'm going to
###151 need for skinning--
###152 which really, all it is is a scalpel, pair of scissors, and
###156 a pair of pliers.
###157 I'm going to start right up here between the ears, stick
###161 in my scalpel, which is fresh and sharp.
###164 Usually it takes me about 20 or 30 minutes to
###167 totally skin a fox.
###169 The fox, it's impossible to skin all the
###172 way down to the toes.
###173 So what I'm going to have to do is break the bone and cut
###177 it off right here.
###179 OK, I'm going to skin the tail now.
###182 This is the grossest part, considering where you're
###185 working at, you know, underneath the tail.
###188 INTERVIEWER: When your husband first met you, what did he
###190 think about the taxidermy business?
###192 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: He thought it was really interesting.
###195 We met on the internet.
###196 But we started talking about taxidermy right off.
###199 And that's why he became interested.
###201 INTERVIEWER: What'd you guys do on your first date?
###203 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: We actually went to a gun show.
###205 INTERVIEWER: Really?
###206 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Yeah.
###206 Looked at the guns.
###207 And then he came back to my house and I showed him my
###209 taxidermy shop.
###211 Robby is somewhat of a cowboy, I guess you could say.
###215 He likes wearing the Western clothes and
###217 the big belt buckle.
###219 And he's ridden bulls in the past too.
###222 INTERVIEWER: Do you ever have people bring you their pets to
###224 preserve after they die?
###225 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: I've done a poodle for a lady.
###228 And I've also done a cat rug.
###230 The lady wasn't local.
###232 She was from New York, actually.
###235 And she sent me her poodle in the mail.
###238 She overnighted it with some dry ice.
###240 And once I got it, I mounted it for her in a sleeping
###243 position and then I mailed it back to her.
###246 INTERVIEWER: Do you think you'll mount your own pets
###247 when they die?
###248 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Mm-hm.
###248 I have a dog and a cat and a snake that I would possibly
###253 mount once they die.
###255 But it'll just be a decision I'll have to make at the time.
###258 Are you at the ears now?
###260 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Yes, I'm at the ears.
###262 This is the ear right here.
###264 See that hole there?
###265 That's the inner ear.
###267 This is the most interesting part, when I get to go around
###269 the eyes and the ears.
###271 It's interesting to take the eyelid away from the eye.
###276 You can see the nasal cavity there.
###278 I just removed the nose along with the skin.
###283 There you go.
###283 The hide is now removed from the carcass.
###288 The first thing you always have to do is prepare the form
###291 that's going to go inside of it.
###293 INTERVIEWER: Do you ever watch horror movies or slasher
###295 flicks, like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or anything?
###298 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Actually, no.
###299 I don't have any desire to watch movies like that.
###302 I have mounted some squirrels for the "Texas Chainsaw
###305 Massacre" movie.
###307 INTERVIEWER: How did they find you?
###308 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: They found me through my website.
###309 They called me and said they needed 12 squirrels mounted in
###312 a dead position for one of their shoots.
###315 Yeah.
###317 I haven't seen it because I don't want to
###319 see movies like that.
###322 INTERVIEWER: So do you have any hobbies?
###324 Things you do on the side?
###325 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: My main hobbies are hunting and
###327 playing the piano.
###329 INTERVIEWER: Do you really hunt with the crossbow?
###330 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Oh, yeah.
###331 I've shot a dear with this.
###332 INTERVIEWER: Yeah?
###333 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Yeah.
###334 INTERVIEWER: Is it harder to hunt with a
###335 crossbow than with a gun?
###336 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Definitely.
###338 You've got to get the deer in about as close as that target
###341 is right there.
###342 
###347 That was a bull's-eye right there.
###350 INTERVIEWER: What instrument do you play?
###351 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: I play the piano.
###353 INTERVIEWER: What kind of music?
###354 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: John Tesh, mainly.
###356 A lot of John Tesh and Yanni.
###358 I actually met him when he was in concert one time.
###362 
###372 INTERVIEWER: Do you ever because you work on a mount
###374 for so long sort of give it a name in your head, like I'm
###377 going to work on "Bob" today or something?
###380 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: I don't really anymore.
###381 I used to sometimes give them names.
###383 I would actually give them names of guys that I liked.
###387 Actually, the antelope up there, his name is Dan.
###390 INTERVIEWER: What was Dan like?
###392 AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: He was just real friendly and nice.
###394 But he doesn't even know that there's an
###396 antelope named after him.
###398 
###403 This is pretty much the finished product.
###406 He's going to need to be sewed on his back and
###408 sewed on the tail.
###409 And I'll put him on a habitat base and he'll be ready to go.
###415 Sometimes at night, I do remember images of skinned
###419 carcasses and just creepy stuff like that.
###422 It does bother me sometimes.
###423 But I think I kind of just put it out of my mind.
###426 I'm very happy right now.
###428 I'm the happiest I've ever been.
###429 I've got my own house and I'm married now, so I'm pretty
###433 much where I want to be for right now.
###435
