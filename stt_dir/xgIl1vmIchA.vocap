###14 This is Basim.
###15 BASIM USMANI: This is Suroosh.
###15 SUROOSH ALVI: This is The Vice Guide to Karachi.
###18 BASIM USMANI: Oh, shit.

###29 SUROOSH ALVI: Karachi is the biggest and fastest growing
###31 city in Pakistan.
###32 And with a population of around 18 million people, it's
###35 one of the biggest in the world.
###38 It is also the country's financial capital.
###39 And is considered the most educated and
###41 diverse city in Pakistan.
###44 However, it is also the most violent.
###47 [MUSIC PLAYING AND YELLING IN URDU]
###49 SUROOSH ALVI: It's true.
###50 We hear about violence in Pakistan all the time.
###53 At least when it comes to the seemingly never ending war
###55 against the Taliban and al-Qaeda.
###58 But in 2011, more than three times as many people were
###61 killed in Karachi than the number of people killed in
###63 American drone strikes in the tribal areas.
###66 Why does that matter?
###67 Because Pakistan matters.
###69 Whether you're an American worried about the extremists,
###72 an Indian worried about the nukes, or an Afghan worried
###76 about Pakistan's ambitions, basically, Pakistan is a
###79 powder keg.
###80 And Karachi is the detonator that could set it all off.
###85 We wanted to explore the inner workings of this ultraviolent
###87 metropolis and meet the players who make Karachi one
###91 of the craziest cities on earth.

###169 BASIM USMANI: Fuck yeah.
###170 We've got a escort from the fucking most
###172 dangerous people there.
###174 SUROOSH ALVI: Lyari is considered a no-go area by
###177 most people.
###178 It's Karachi's most densely populated slum and is
###181 notorious for it's thriving drug and gambling dens.
###185 Hardly a day goes by without a headline detailing some kind
###188 of horrific violence that occurred there the day before.
###191 And every so often, like the night we chose to visit, the
###194 police decide to conduct an operation against it's most
###196 famous residents, the Baloch brothers.
###200 Zafar Baloch and his brother, Uzair, are the dons of Lyari.
###203 And they're credited with providing basic social
###205 services to the residents that the city
###207 itself doesn't provide.
###209 So even though they're accused of operating a mafia based on
###212 drugs, kidnapping, extortion, and murder, they are the
###216 patron saints of Lyari.
###218 BASIM USMANI: The people over there are not going to fuck
###220 with us if we're talking to Zafar.
###221 SUROOSH ALVI: If anything, we got to worry about the cops.
###223 Because they're not going to want it to get on film that
###225 they're killing the locals.
###227 BASIM USMANI: That they probably don't want.
###229 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah.
###229 Let's avoid the cops and just hang out with the oppressed.
###232 BASIM USMANI: Yeah.
###233 Fuck the cops.
###233 We already know that.
###234 Fuck the police.
###236 SUROOSH ALVI: We rolled up to the edge of Lyari and saw a
###239 slew of cops and local news outlets standing on the
###241 outside looking in.
###243 
###247 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING URDU]
###251 SUROOSH ALVI: We met up with Zafar's boys and
###252 followed them in.
###254 There's a huge police operation trying
###256 to arrest this guy.
###257 And look at him.
###258 He's just standing there.
###259 BASIM USMANI: Meet the man behind the plan.
###261 [SPEAKING URDU]
###263 SUROOSH ALVI: Very nice to meet you.
###264 BASIM USMANI: [SPEAKING URDU]

###280 BASIM USMANI: [SPEAKING URDU]
###282 
###285 We made it.
###285 We made it.
###286 What'd you think of him?
###287 SUROOSH ALVI: I like him.
###288 He's nice.
###289 It seemed, like, I felt safe around him.
###291 BASIM USMANI: Yeah.
###292 SUROOSH ALVI: You know, like, uncle.
###293 Classic mafia, right.
###294 The guy who's in parliament, he doesn't do anything.
###297 And this guy does everything.
###298 Sounds like he should be in office.
###300 BASIM USMANI: Too bad they're trying to arrest him.
###301 SUROOSH ALVI: But it doesn't feel like anything's going on.
###303 What is the operation, though?
###305 What are they trying to achieve?
###306 
###310 SUROOSH ALVI: And you're protecting him?

###343 SUROOSH ALVI: I think the cops are around the corner.
###346 They said the cops were too afraid to come any closer.
###348 [MUSIC PLAYING AND YELLING IN URDU]
###349 SUROOSH ALVI: We're basically hanging out with a bunch of
###351 young punks in the ghetto at 4:00 in the morning.
###356 Though there were signs of serious fighting earlier in
###358 the day, while we were there the police fired a single
###361 canister of tear gas.
###362 And our escort was running around suggesting slogans for
###364 everyone to yell into our camera.
###368 SUROOSH ALVI: This is kind of not what I was expecting.
###371 BASIM USMANI: No.
###372 It wasn't what I was expecting, too.
###373 When they said that there was a protest with 10 people dead,
###375 I didn't expect 15-year-old hood rats just going around
###378 tearing shit up.
###379 SUROOSH ALVI: And no people dead thanks to the
###380 misinformation in this country.
###383 This is the tear gas that the cops shot today.
###387 Welcome to Karachi.
