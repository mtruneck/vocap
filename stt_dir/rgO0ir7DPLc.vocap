###5 Back on the throttle, flat out through the left over 100mph on the exit. Such a joy to
###5 drive this car but can it take on the Alfa for pure driving thrills. Alfa Romeo is one
###17 of the most evocative names in the world of motoring. But for the last few decades the
###21 firm hasn't had a sports car that lives up to their illustrious sporting heritage but
###26 now they have - this car, the Alfa Romeo 4C. With a carbon fibre chassis, dual-clutch gearbox
###33 and a mid-engine layout the spec sheet reads like a super car, yet it costs less than 50K.
###39 But how does it compare to arguably the best mid-engined sports car in the world - Porsche's
###43 Cayman. Well, in an Auto Express track battle, let's find out. The stunningly beautiful 4C
###49 is a return to Alfa Romeo's sports car past. With its carbon fibre chassis, it weights
###54 just 895kg while the 1.7-litre four-cylinder turbo engine produces 270bhp and 350Nm of
###63 torque. Now into its second generation the Porsche Cayman is famous for its perfect handling
###69 the 2.7-litre flat-six engine has 271bhp and 290Nm of torque. But it weights 1,310kg so
###79 that's 400kg heavier than the carbon-fibre Alfa Romeo. So we've got a very standard Cayman,
###92 it's not a Cayman S just a standard Cayman. Hasn't got an active damping system - it's
###98 just a very standard Cayman. The Cayman's lovely it works on so many layers it's a fantastic
###108 road car, rides relatively nicely, quite comfortable on the road so it's got that element. But
###114 the big question is, can it take on the Alfa for pure driving thrill? And, so many things
###120 about this car just feel perfect - the second you drive onto the circuit you just feel absolutely
###125 at the centre of the action. Everything's beautifully balanced - you just feel like
###129 the car is pivoting around you so obviously mid-engined, rear-wheel-drive, just absolutely
###134 perfect balance in the chassis. There's a little bit of roll in the car but nothing
###139 bad, you know it's just such a wonderfully well-balanced car. It's got a sports exhaust
###145 which is really good. Traction is amazing - it's quite long gearing in the Cayman so,
###155 and the engine only really starts to sing above 4,500RPM so on the road you can sometimes
###162 feel like it's a little bit out of its comfort zone but the track when you get it working
###167 it really sounds amazing so that's the first lap done, little bit of heating to the tyres.
###171 It's come round and you start a flying lap, so across the line, second gear, and again
###177 because that gearing is quite short down the second here, there's so much feel through
###181 the steering that you just always know what the car is doing. Change of direction is amazing
###186 there, lots of grip as the car's loaded up with that long long left-hander. Up to third
###193 gear, just over 100mph and 110 hard on the brakes down to second gear for the corner.
###198 Loads of feel through the brakes, ABS doesn't come in too hard. Third gear, amazing traction
###207 on the exit of that tight corner. Again, into these higher-speed corners the control and
###212 the balance on the car is just - you really feel what's going on, it's such a joy to drive
###219 this car. It's so beautifully balanced, sounds great and just communicates so well. Third
###226 gear, high speed change of direction here. You can feel the weight through here but,
###230 still, pretty amazing through there. Right up at the top of the revs in third, down to
###238 second, really good brakes. Into the apex, great traction into the last corner. Such
###249 a lovely car and across the line. So the Porsche was a joy to drive and lapped the circuit
###255 in 1 minute 12.7 seconds the question is, is the Alfa Romeo going to be faster? Starting
###269 a practice lap the first thing you notice about the car is that it doesn't have power
###278 steering. Surely the reason for not having power steering is to save weight, but also
###283 to give you an uninterrupted purity of steering feel - unfortunately, the steering feel isn't
###290 very good. The steering really squirms around and kicks back quite a lot. But you can't
###293 really feel what the front end's doing which is a shame because the one thing you're going
###299 to want if you've got no power steering is good steering feel but it's a shame. The engine's
###307 quite coarse, it's not a nice noise like the six-cylinder Porsche. It does make itself
###310 known in the cabin but the dual-clutch gearbox is pretty quick and perfectly suited to the
###317 job. The other disappointment you notice really is the fact that the brake pedal - it's very
###324 strong and there's plenty of stopping power, but there's not a lot of feel to the brake
###331 pedal and it's quite hard to brake progressively. The retardation is quite grabby and it gets
###334 into the ABS very quickly, but the body control around that high-speed corner is just amazing.
###340 There's hardly any roll in this car it does feel like a really planted track car. So,
###345 let's see if that gives it the advantage against the stopwatch. So, coming round now starting
###350 the lap - trying to get good traction out of it, which is pretty good. Much shorter
###354 gearing than the Porsche, so we're a gear up in some of these corners, so change the
###357 gear into this first corner here - really good through there as it changes direction
###361 from left to right. A little bit of understeer as you get on the power - there is a little
###366 bit more understeer in this car than you probably would like and because of the fact with the
###370 Turbo power it's quite hard to dial the understeer to oversteer because when you get back on
###376 the throttle you have the engines not on boost and then it suddenly comes into boost. It's
###380 better now on the track when it's dried off, when the track was damp that made the car
###385 quite edgy quite tricky. Now that it's dried off it's pretty good and through these high
###392 speed corners turning and the really stiff body control means that there's lots of grip
###396 and it is really planted through here. But again just a little bit too much understeer,
###409 mighty through here though, little lift through the right. Back on the throttle flat out through
###411 the left over 100 on the exit hard on the brakes squirms a little bit again too much
###412 on the braking. Power through the gears, second gear, third gear around to the last corner
###421 coming up to the line now and across the line. Incredibly, given how different they are to
###429 drive this pair record an identical lap time around our test track. That's the first time
###434 that's every happened - so what's going to win our track battle? Well the Alfa is beautiful,
###439 has loads of grip and fantastic body control but unfortunately it lacks the sublime chassis,
###445 communication and fingertip feel of the Porsche. The Cayman is also more practical, cheaper
###450 and better to live with day-to-day. So, while we love the look of the Alfa, the all-round
###455 abilities of the Cayman make it one of the best sports cars money can buy - and it wins
###459 this track battle.
