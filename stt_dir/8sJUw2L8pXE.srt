three centuries ago
by the clowns and the actors

of the Italian fairgrounds.

0:1:32,75 --> 0:1:37,583
Today, mere costumed characters
at a masked ball.


10

Where now their mystery,
their magic,

0:1:40,83 --> 0:1:42,208
their comedy...

CRONSHAW:
Ready for the party, Uncle?


14
0:1:51,958 --> 0:1:53,958
Well, where's your mask?


15
0:1:53,958 --> 0:1:56,0
It's not midnight yet,
you know, Eustace.

You'd think the Hun would
remember 1918 as well as we do.

"What a pity the Hun
prefers fighting to fun."

not more for your collection?

Magnificent set, isn't it?


23
0:2:15,792 --> 0:2:17,42
Just over from Holland.


24
0:2:17,42 --> 0:2:19,292
And Mira's holding it for me
till the end of the month.

I can guess why
you're telling me.

for dinner tonight, sir?

MAN: Yes. She should be arriving
in about half an hour.


43

is gaining, sir.

I'm quite aware of that,
thank you.

I'm afraid I'm a little early.

0:3:42,333 --> 0:3:44,792
That's quite all right, miss.

a fine night, I --

Hey, is that the time?


56
0:3:50,958 --> 0:3:52,83
Approximately.


57
0:3:52,83 --> 0:3:54,125
Of course.
I forgot -- it gains.

Thank you, Miss Lemon.

I think Captain Hastings was
listening to the weather report


65

to see whether
you'd need an umbrella.


66
0:4:14,292 --> 0:4:17,708
Oh.

0:4:17,708 --> 0:4:21,542
This urgent package
just arrived by messenger.

0:4:21,542 --> 0:4:24,542
Can I go now?

Ah. I was wondering
where that had got to.


74
0:4:39,75 --> 0:4:41,542
Apparently, we won't need
an umbrella.


75
0:4:41,542 --> 0:4:45,75
Oh, you haven't forgotten,
have you?

You promised
you'd try and make it.

looking forward to it.

-- Ackerley is?
-- HASTINGS: He's with the BBC.


80

But he's quite a decent chap.

Well, unfortunately,


82

I have to rearrange
my stamps in order of size.

Please convey my apologies
to M. Ackerley.


84

He'll be very disappointed.

0:32:4,167 --> 0:32:6,75
I couldn't decide
on my autumn look.


580
0:32:6,75 --> 0:32:9,83
Anyway, Eustace can afford it.


581
0:32:9,83 --> 0:32:14,25
He's Viscount Cronshaw now.


582
0:32:14,25 --> 0:32:15,917
26 pence.


583
0:32:15,917 --> 0:32:17,125
Oh.


584
0:32:17,125 --> 0:32:22,167
To what do we owe
this delegation?


585
0:32:22,167 --> 0:32:24,917
Well, M. Poirot
has taken it into his head


586
0:32:24,917 --> 0:32:26,833
to see these famous figurines.


587
0:32:26,833 --> 0:32:28,875
-- Oh.
-- A foolish whim.


588
0:32:28,875 --> 0:32:30,75
Is His Highness
at home, Summers?


589
0:32:30,75 --> 0:32:34,208
His...Lordship is in
the morning room, madam.


590
0:32:34,208 --> 0:32:35,5
Thank you.


591
0:32:35,5 --> 0:32:46,583
This way, gang.


592
0:32:46,583 --> 0:32:47,833
Summers, be a dear


593
0:32:47,833 --> 0:32:50,958
and take the boxes, will you?


594
0:32:50,958 --> 0:32:52,833
Hi, Eustace.


595
0:32:52,833 --> 0:32:56,375
Ooh, I see you're already
enjoying your inheritance.


596
0:32:56,375 --> 0:32:57,75
It's beautiful.


597
0:32:57,75 --> 0:33:0,42
May as well salvage
some consolation


598
0:33:0,42 --> 0:33:2,0
out of this awful business.


599
0:33:2,0 --> 0:33:3,208
-- Hmm.
-- Ah.


600
0:33:3,208 --> 0:33:5,917
Poirot, Hastings.


601
0:33:5,917 --> 0:33:6,958
Welcome.


602
0:33:6,958 --> 0:33:8,625
Good afternoon, Viscount.


603
0:33:8,625 --> 0:33:11,167
I say, what a quaint
little tea set.


604
0:33:11,167 --> 0:33:14,83
Hastings, this tea set
is not only "quaint,"


605
0:33:14,83 --> 0:33:16,208
as you call it, but priceless


606
0:33:16,208 --> 0:33:18,333
and very rare, n'est-ce pas?


607
0:33:18,333 --> 0:33:21,417
Had no idea you were
interested in china, Poirot.


608
0:33:21,417 --> 0:33:24,83
Mr. Poirot wants
to see the figurines.


609
0:33:24,83 --> 0:33:25,125
The Meissens?


610
0:33:25,125 --> 0:33:26,417
Mais oui.


611
0:33:26,417 --> 0:33:28,458
We have all heard
so much about them


612
0:33:28,458 --> 0:33:31,292
and of your success in
bringing them to this country.


613
0:33:31,292 --> 0:33:33,833
I wonder if I could please
make an examination.


614
0:33:33,833 --> 0:33:34,958
Feel free.


615
0:33:34,958 --> 0:33:40,75
Thank you.


616
0:33:40,75 --> 0:33:42,667
Ah.


617
0:33:42,667 --> 0:33:48,25
May I?


618
0:33:48,25 --> 0:33:52,208
I can't imagine
what he's looking for.


619
0:33:52,208 --> 0:33:54,583
Tricks of the trade, you know.


620
0:33:54,583 --> 0:33:56,83
POIROT:
The costumes last night


621
0:33:56,83 --> 0:34:0,625
at the ball -- they were
exact replicas of these?


622
0:34:0,625 --> 0:34:2,167
To the last detail.


623
0:34:2,167 --> 0:34:4,792
Oh.


624
0:34:4,792 --> 0:34:7,417
And this was your apparel,
was it not?


625
0:34:7,417 --> 0:34:9,75
Punchinello,


626
0:34:9,75 --> 0:34:12,833
with the elaborate ruff
and the hump.


627
0:34:12,833 --> 0:34:15,417
Yes.


628
0:34:15,417 --> 0:34:18,875
I imagine it took
some time to change


629
0:34:18,875 --> 0:34:20,292
in and out of this costume.


630
0:34:20,292 --> 0:34:25,625
I had to hold him up
while he unfastened it.


631
0:34:25,625 --> 0:34:32,583
As I thought.


632
0:34:32,583 --> 0:34:34,5
Viscount, where were you


633
0:34:34,5 --> 0:34:37,792
after supper last night
during the ball?


634
0:34:37,792 --> 0:34:40,208
Trying to beat down
the dealer chap over this lot.


635
0:34:40,208 --> 0:34:42,5
Finally managed to corner him.


636
0:34:42,5 --> 0:34:44,83
In the supper room?


637
0:34:44,83 --> 0:34:45,792
That's right.


638
0:34:45,792 --> 0:34:52,708
Again, I thank you.


639
0:34:52,708 --> 0:35:8,667
Well, cheerio.


640
0:35:8,667 --> 0:35:10,667
Ah, there you are, Poirot.


641
0:35:10,667 --> 0:35:12,917
I've been looking for you.


642
0:35:12,917 --> 0:35:14,125
Chief Inspector Japp.


643
0:35:14,125 --> 0:35:15,75
I've been doing some thinking,


644
0:35:15,75 --> 0:35:17,708
and to my mind,
that missing pompom


645
0:35:17,708 --> 0:35:19,917
could only have come
from one person.


646
0:35:19,917 --> 0:35:22,125
I concur absolutely,
Chief Inspector.


647
0:35:22,125 --> 0:35:31,333
Excuse me.


648
0:35:31,333 --> 0:35:32,708
Mrs. Davidson?


649
0:35:32,708 --> 0:35:34,625
Yes.


650
0:35:34,625 --> 0:35:37,708
JAPP:
May we come in?


651
0:35:37,708 --> 0:35:40,833
Oh, thank you.


652
0:35:40,833 --> 0:35:44,0
I'm sorry my husband isn't here.


653
0:35:44,0 --> 0:35:45,667
He went out for a drink.


654
0:35:45,667 --> 0:35:48,292
A bit early for that
sort of thing, isn't it?


655
0:35:48,292 --> 0:35:50,542
He's the sociable type, is he?


656
0:35:50,542 --> 0:35:51,667
Yes.


657
0:35:51,667 --> 0:35:55,5
Unlike me.


658
0:35:55,5 --> 0:35:59,917
Acting isn't exactly
a good, steady job, you know.


659
0:35:59,917 --> 0:36:2,208
You're not in
the profession yourself?


660
0:36:2,208 --> 0:36:3,25
No.


661
0:36:3,25 --> 0:36:6,542
I thought I might like to once,
but I just couldn't,


662
0:36:6,542 --> 0:36:8,917
not in front of everyone
like that.


663
0:36:8,917 --> 0:36:12,375
Why, indeed there are many types
of people in this world, madame.


664
0:36:12,375 --> 0:36:15,125
We must each be true
to ourselves.


665
0:36:15,125 --> 0:36:21,583
Perhaps.


666
0:36:21,583 --> 0:36:23,333
What exactly did you want?


667
0:36:23,333 --> 0:36:25,125
M. Poirot here has some notion


668
0:36:25,125 --> 0:36:26,958
of staging a reconstruction
of the evening.


669
0:36:26,958 --> 0:36:29,208
POIROT:
Oui, that is so.


670
0:36:29,208 --> 0:36:30,25
Oh?


671
0:36:30,25 --> 0:36:33,5
Oh, it is just merely a question
of detail to be checked.


672
0:36:33,5 --> 0:36:35,75
The precise nature
of the costumes


673
0:36:35,75 --> 0:36:38,333
that were made for you
for last night's ball.


674
0:36:38,333 --> 0:36:39,375
You understand?


675
0:36:39,375 --> 0:36:40,417
I think so.


676
0:36:40,417 --> 0:36:42,0
JAPP: We'd like to
have a look at them


677
0:36:42,0 --> 0:36:44,125
for a moment, if we may.
Do you still have them?


678
0:36:44,125 --> 0:36:47,5
I'm afraid not.


679
0:36:47,5 --> 0:36:52,0
My husband sent them
to be cleaned.


680
0:36:52,0 --> 0:36:53,833
POIROT:
Yes, of course.


681
0:36:53,833 --> 0:36:56,542
Quel dommage.


682
0:36:56,542 --> 0:36:59,5
Well, I'm very sorry to have
disturbed you, Mme. Davidson.


683
0:36:59,5 --> 0:37:6,792
We will just finish our tea.

[ Coughs ]


685
0:37:17,167 --> 0:37:22,0
POIROT:
Thank you, Hastings.


686
0:37:22,0 --> 0:37:23,625
You were right, Mme. Davidson,


687
0:37:23,625 --> 0:37:25,333
not to consider
a career in acting.


688
0:37:25,333 --> 0:37:29,375
Your eyes betrayed
what your tongue denied.


689
0:37:29,375 --> 0:37:30,417
Chief Inspector?


690
0:37:30,417 --> 0:37:32,958
There's a pompom missing
from the Pierrette costume.


691
0:37:32,958 --> 0:37:34,0
Is there?


692
0:37:34,0 --> 0:37:36,625
JAPP:
Perhaps you'd like to tell us


693
0:37:36,625 --> 0:37:39,42
how it came to turn up in
the hand of the murdered man.


694
0:37:39,42 --> 0:37:40,458
Oh, yes, I forgot.


695
0:37:40,458 --> 0:37:42,958
It got pulled off after supper,


696
0:37:42,958 --> 0:37:45,833
and I didn't know
what to do with it.


697
0:37:45,833 --> 0:37:48,875
I looked for Mr. Beltaine,
but he was in the supper room


698
0:37:48,875 --> 0:37:51,0
having some kind of argument,


699
0:37:51,0 --> 0:37:53,83
so I gave it to Lord Cronshaw
to look after.


700
0:37:53,83 --> 0:37:56,375
Sorry, I didn't think
it was important.


701
0:37:56,375 --> 0:37:59,83
Does that answer your question?


702
0:37:59,83 --> 0:38:0,833
You must understand,
Mme. Davidson,


703
0:38:0,833 --> 0:38:3,458
that to conceal information
may not only protect the guilty,


704
0:38:3,458 --> 0:38:6,875
but also punish the innocent.


705
0:38:6,875 --> 0:38:9,0
You do understand, do you not?


706
0:38:9,0 --> 0:38:12,0
I understand.


707
0:38:12,0 --> 0:38:17,417
I'm sorry.

BOY:
Sunday Standard!


709
0:38:18,458 --> 0:38:20,792
Her story seemed
completely plausible.


710
0:38:20,792 --> 0:38:22,0
Except in one respect.


711
0:38:22,0 --> 0:38:25,83
-- What's that?
-- It is a foolish lie.


712
0:38:25,83 --> 0:38:27,208
The threads of the pompom
that we discovered


713
0:38:27,208 --> 0:38:28,833
in the hand of
Lord Cronshaw —


714
0:38:28,833 --> 0:38:30,458
they were torn, whereas those


715
0:38:30,458 --> 0:38:32,417
on the costume
of Mme. Davidson were cut.


716
0:38:32,417 --> 0:38:34,83
You mean she cut it off herself?


717
0:38:34,83 --> 0:38:35,125
No, no, Hastings.


718
0:38:35,125 --> 0:38:37,333
She did not even notice
that the pompom was missing


719
0:38:37,333 --> 0:38:38,417
until we pointed it out.


720
0:38:38,417 --> 0:38:40,75
That is why she made up
that story that was ridiculous.


721
0:38:40,75 --> 0:38:42,417
Hers was cut by the murderer.


722
0:38:42,417 --> 0:38:43,583
Why?


723
0:38:43,583 --> 0:38:45,333
To replace the one
that Lord Cronshaw


724
0:38:45,333 --> 0:38:47,208
had torn from the costume
of his killer.


725
0:38:47,208 --> 0:38:49,42
Well, if it wasn't her,
and her husband


726
0:38:49,42 --> 0:38:51,167
wasn't even there when
Cronshaw was murdered —


727
0:38:51,167 --> 0:38:53,25
Have either of you
considered the possibility


728
0:38:53,25 --> 0:38:54,292
of a duplicate costume?


729
0:38:54,292 --> 0:38:55,75
Another Pierrot?


730
0:38:55,75 --> 0:38:59,25
Well, what about that note
he left -- Lowestoft?


731
0:38:59,25 --> 0:39:2,25
Ah, yes, the note.


732
0:39:2,25 --> 0:39:4,5
May I suggest that you inquire


733
0:39:4,5 --> 0:39:6,458
from the dealer
about the dinner service


734
0:39:6,458 --> 0:39:8,625
that has just been purchased
by Lord Beltaine?


735
0:39:8,625 --> 0:39:12,708
I think you will discover that
it is rare Lowestoft china.


736
0:39:12,708 --> 0:39:14,875
You mean —


737
0:39:14,875 --> 0:39:16,75

to restore

but I have always refused.

However, tonight, I have
decided to present for you

of Pulcinella,
ever shall he fail.


772
0:41:34,0 --> 0:41:37,125
MAN: Heroes' tragic fate
is saddest.


773
0:41:37,125 --> 0:41:40,42
See his painted tear.


774
0:41:40,42 --> 0:41:43,792
WOMAN: Sighing for
his own Pierrette,


775
0:41:43,792 --> 0:41:45,708
star-crossed lovers.


776
0:41:45,708 --> 0:41:47,708
So completes


777
0:41:47,708 --> 0:41:53,917
our masqueraders
gathered once more here.


778
0:41:53,917 --> 0:41:58,42
And so our little evocation
is complete.


779
0:41:58,42 --> 0:42:1,458
Our ensemble is before us.


780
0:42:1,458 --> 0:42:4,167
And this, ladies and gentlemen,


781
0:42:4,167 --> 0:42:7,875
I have been told
is the wonder of radio,


782
0:42:7,875 --> 0:42:11,792
because what we see
is in the eye of our mind.


783
0:42:11,792 --> 0:42:14,75
What is in the eye
of your mind,


784
0:42:14,75 --> 0:42:16,167
Mme. Mallaby?


785
0:42:16,167 --> 0:42:19,208
Why, the six characters
we heard,


786
0:42:19,208 --> 0:42:20,667
of course.


787
0:42:20,667 --> 0:42:22,42
Viscount?


788
0:42:22,42 --> 0:42:23,917
Oh, just the same.


789
0:42:23,917 --> 0:42:26,875
The six characters as portrayed


790
0:42:26,875 --> 0:42:29,292
by my figurines, but —


791
0:42:29,292 --> 0:42:34,292
You agree, Mme. Davidson?


792
0:42:34,292 --> 0:42:36,542
Of course we agree,
Mr. Poirot.


793
0:42:36,542 --> 0:42:37,583
POIROT:
Bon.


794
0:42:37,583 --> 0:42:42,583
But now let us see
the reality before us.


795
0:42:42,583 --> 0:42:44,833
Messieurs, mesdames,


796
0:42:44,833 --> 0:42:47,667
the players.


797
0:42:47,667 --> 0:42:50,0
Oh.


798
0:42:50,0 --> 0:42:52,708
I present to you
Pierrette, Pierrot,


799
0:42:52,708 --> 0:42:56,292
Pulcinella, Punchinello,
and Columbine.


800
0:42:56,292 --> 0:42:58,583
There's one missing.


801
0:42:58,583 --> 0:42:59,958
That's right.


802
0:42:59,958 --> 0:43:1,792
Where's Harlequin?


803
0:43:1,792 --> 0:43:5,458
Have you forgotten, Viscount,


804
0:43:5,458 --> 0:43:13,875
that Harlequin
can become invisible?


805
0:43:13,875 --> 0:43:19,667
Let us now reveal the truth.


806
0:43:19,667 --> 0:43:22,458
Are you ready to tell us
the truth,


807
0:43:22,458 --> 0:43:24,542
Mme. Davidson,


808
0:43:24,542 --> 0:43:29,75
or shall I?


809
0:43:29,75 --> 0:43:31,0
Very well.


810
0:43:31,0 --> 0:43:35,292
It was all very simple.


811
0:43:35,292 --> 0:43:37,708
The motive behind the murders


812
0:43:37,708 --> 0:43:41,167
of both Lord Cronshaw
and Coco Courtney


813
0:43:41,167 --> 0:43:46,708
was the evil drug cocaine.


814
0:43:46,708 --> 0:43:48,458
You're staying right here!


815
0:43:48,458 --> 0:43:51,83
I'm not prepared to have
an argument about it.


816
0:43:51,83 --> 0:43:52,625
POIROT:
During the Victory Ball,


817
0:43:52,625 --> 0:43:54,83
I witnessed
an argument between


818
0:43:54,83 --> 0:43:55,75
Lord Cronshaw and Mlle. Coco.


819
0:43:55,75 --> 0:43:57,83
They were known to be lovers,


820
0:43:57,83 --> 0:43:59,417
but Cronshaw had discovered
Coco's secret addiction.


821
0:43:59,417 --> 0:44:1,5
What the hell do you think
you're laughing at?


822
0:44:1,5 --> 0:44:5,167
POIROT: The young Lord Cronshaw
was a man of high principle.


823
0:44:5,167 --> 0:44:8,583
He seized his lover's cocaine
and threatened to


824
0:44:8,583 --> 0:44:12,0
expose the supplier
who was destroying her life


825
0:44:12,0 --> 0:44:14,0
along with many others.


826
0:44:14,0 --> 0:44:21,958
But Coco was now
hopelessly addicted.


827
0:44:21,958 --> 0:44:24,167
By the time she reached home,


828
0:44:24,167 --> 0:44:27,542
she had obtained a new,
fatally strong dose of cocaine


829
0:44:27,542 --> 0:44:29,708
from her supplier,
who now knew


830
0:44:29,708 --> 0:44:31,833
the one chance to avoid prison


831
0:44:31,833 --> 0:44:35,167
was murder.


832
0:44:35,167 --> 0:44:38,458
But what of our Harlequin?


833
0:44:38,458 --> 0:44:40,75
When I examined the body
of Lord Cronshaw,


834
0:44:40,75 --> 0:44:43,542
I failed to discover
the pompom.


835
0:44:43,542 --> 0:44:44,583
Why?


836
0:44:44,583 --> 0:44:47,833
Because the fist was clenched
tight with the rigor mortis.


837
0:44:47,833 --> 0:44:50,167
Lord Cronshaw
was not killed at 12:00.


838
0:44:50,167 --> 0:44:52,25
He was killed earlier
in the evening


839
0:44:52,25 --> 0:44:54,833
and the body hidden in
the recess until later.


840
0:44:54,833 --> 0:44:55,958
Voilà.


841
0:44:55,958 --> 0:44:57,292
But that can't be.


842
0:44:57,292 --> 0:45:0,875
I saw him myself
a few moments before midnight.


843
0:45:0,875 --> 0:45:3,83
No, no, no, Mme. Mallaby.


844
0:45:3,83 --> 0:45:6,917
The Harlequin that you saw,
that very same Harlequin,


845
0:45:6,917 --> 0:45:13,875
is here with us in this room.


846
0:45:13,875 --> 0:45:16,792
The killer had
a duplicate costume,


847
0:45:16,792 --> 0:45:20,875
and after the murder,
assumed the role of Harlequin,


848
0:45:20,875 --> 0:45:24,292
even scribbling a false clue
pointing to M. Beltaine


849
0:45:24,292 --> 0:45:27,0
and his obsession
with the Lowestoft china.


850
0:45:27,0 --> 0:45:28,208
Ridiculous, huh?


851
0:45:28,208 --> 0:45:31,5
Since the elaborate costume
of M. Beltaine


852
0:45:31,5 --> 0:45:35,125
cannot be changed
without assistance.


853
0:45:35,125 --> 0:45:37,417
No.


854
0:45:37,417 --> 0:45:39,875
The murder took place
soon after supper,


855
0:45:39,875 --> 0:45:41,375
when the killer contrived


856
0:45:41,375 --> 0:45:43,5
a moment alone
with Lord Cronshaw.


857
0:45:43,5 --> 0:45:45,958
It is Cronshaw
who knows the truth


858
0:45:45,958 --> 0:45:48,167
about the dealing in cocaine.


859
0:45:48,167 --> 0:45:51,292
To avoid being exposed
and to preserve


860
0:45:51,292 --> 0:45:52,458
the evil trade in drugs,


861
0:45:52,458 --> 0:45:55,333
the murderer stabs
Lord Cronshaw to death.


862
0:45:55,333 --> 0:45:57,792
At the time,


863
0:45:57,792 --> 0:46:1,417
the killer is unaware that
the last act of Lord Cronshaw


864
0:46:1,417 --> 0:46:4,125
is to pull the pompom
from the costume.


865
0:46:4,125 --> 0:46:6,708
Then the body is hidden
in the alcove


866
0:46:6,708 --> 0:46:9,125
and the plan,
it can be completed.


867
0:46:9,125 --> 0:46:11,292
-- MALLABY: Yoo-hoo!
-- POIROT: At last,


868
0:46:11,292 --> 0:46:14,333
having alerted Mme. Mallaby
just before midnight,


869
0:46:14,333 --> 0:46:17,167
the final task
was to drag the body


870
0:46:17,167 --> 0:46:18,292
from its hiding place


871
0:46:18,292 --> 0:46:19,333
so it would appear


872
0:46:19,333 --> 0:46:21,75
that the murder had only
just been committed.


873
0:46:21,75 --> 0:46:25,125
MAN:
Twelve seconds to midnight!


874
0:46:25,125 --> 0:46:26,833
Ten, nine,


875
0:46:26,833 --> 0:46:30,458
eight, seven, six,


876
0:46:30,458 --> 0:46:32,208
five, four,


877
0:46:32,208 --> 0:46:36,167
three, two, one!


878
0:46:36,167 --> 0:46:40,375
[ Cheers and applause ]


879
0:46:40,375 --> 0:46:45,125
[ Balloons popping ]


880
0:46:45,125 --> 0:46:49,5
POIROT: The murderer
then slips quietly away.


881
0:46:49,5 --> 0:46:51,5
[ Screams ]


882
0:46:51,5 --> 0:46:54,42
POIROT: Knowing that
when the discovery


883
0:46:54,42 --> 0:46:58,625
of the body occurs,
it is believed


884
0:46:58,625 --> 0:47:2,417
that he is safely at home.


885
0:47:2,417 --> 0:47:5,958
No, it couldn't
have been Chris.


886
0:47:5,958 --> 0:47:8,42
POIROT:
But it was, Mme. Davidson.


887
0:47:8,42 --> 0:47:9,125
It was your husband who had


888
0:47:9,125 --> 0:47:10,667
a moment alone
with Lord Cronshaw!


889
0:47:10,667 --> 0:47:12,375
It was your husband
who gave to Coco


890
0:47:12,375 --> 0:47:14,792
when they were alone together
in the taxi more cocaine!


891
0:47:14,792 --> 0:47:17,0
And, in spite of what
he told us,


892
0:47:17,0 --> 0:47:18,25
it was your husband


893
0:47:18,25 --> 0:47:21,458
who had ample time
to return to the ball


894
0:47:21,458 --> 0:47:37,375
to complete his masquerade
as Harlequin.


895
0:47:37,375 --> 0:47:40,333
And still you protect him,


896
0:47:40,333 --> 0:47:44,0
even though you later discovered


897
0:47:44,0 --> 0:47:48,125
that he was implicating you,
his own wife, in the crime


898
0:47:48,125 --> 0:47:52,83
by replacing the pompom
that was torn from his costume


899
0:47:52,83 --> 0:47:55,708
with the one
he cut from your own.


900
0:47:55,708 --> 0:47:57,792
CHRIS:
Don't listen to him, darling.


901
0:47:57,792 --> 0:48:0,333
Congratulations, Mr. Poirot,


902
0:48:0,333 --> 0:48:4,5
on a most entertaining piece
of detective fiction.


903
0:48:4,5 --> 0:48:5,542
POIROT:
Mais oui.


904
0:48:5,542 --> 0:48:8,917
I'm afraid that is so.


905
0:48:8,917 --> 0:48:11,167
Half a mo.
What do you mean?


906
0:48:11,167 --> 0:48:12,958
Well, because unless
Mme. Davidson


907
0:48:12,958 --> 0:48:15,5
is willing to testify
that her husband deals in drugs,


908
0:48:15,5 --> 0:48:18,42
I'm afraid that everything
that I have told you so far


909
0:48:18,42 --> 0:48:19,458
remains only theory.


910
0:48:19,458 --> 0:48:21,5
Then I take it
that the show is over.


911
0:48:21,5 --> 0:48:22,667
POIROT:
Oui.


912
0:48:22,667 --> 0:48:28,25
Unless...


913
0:48:28,25 --> 0:48:39,5
Harlequin has one last trick.


914
0:48:39,5 --> 0:48:42,0
Mme. Mallaby.


915
0:48:42,0 --> 0:48:49,83
With which hand did you see
Harlequin writing?


916
0:48:49,83 --> 0:48:51,625
Oh, my God.


917
0:48:51,625 --> 0:48:53,708
Cronshaw was right-handed.


918
0:48:53,708 --> 0:48:57,792
JAPP:
Christopher Ian Davidson,


919
0:48:57,792 --> 0:49:0,458
I arrest you for the murders
of Viscount Cronshaw


920
0:49:0,458 --> 0:49:10,625
and Miss Coco Courtney.


921
0:49:10,625 --> 0:49:13,375
If he had not gone too far
and tried to confuse


922
0:49:13,375 --> 0:49:15,958
by writing a clue
that pointed to Beltaine,


923
0:49:15,958 --> 0:49:18,208
he would be walking
away with us now,


924
0:49:18,208 --> 0:49:20,75
but as you say,
M. Ackerley, actors —


925
0:49:20,75 --> 0:49:22,625
they never know when to stop.


926
0:49:22,625 --> 0:49:24,25
However, I thank you
very much indeed


927
0:49:24,25 --> 0:49:25,292
for your cooperation.


928
0:49:25,292 --> 0:49:27,292
I'm honored that you
took up my invitation.


929
0:49:27,292 --> 0:49:29,208
I'm sure it was a most
enlightening experience


930
0:49:29,208 --> 0:49:30,25
for our listeners.


931
0:49:30,25 --> 0:49:32,83
-- Thank you.
-- RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Ackerley?


932
0:49:32,83 --> 0:49:34,333
They've been trying to find you.


933
0:49:34,333 --> 0:49:37,5
The switchboard's been flooded
with callers


934
0:49:37,5 --> 0:49:39,708
complaining about
the dreadful accent,


935
0:49:39,708 --> 0:49:42,125
lowering the standard
of spoken English,


936
0:49:42,125 --> 0:49:43,625
all that sort of thing.


937
0:49:43,625 --> 0:49:44,917
Oh.


938
0:49:44,917 --> 0:49:48,83
Sir John Reith is waiting
to see you in his office.


939
0:49:48,83 --> 0:49:53,875
So sorry.


940
0:49:53,875 --> 0:49:55,75
Don't take it too hard, Poirot.


941
0:49:55,75 --> 0:49:57,0
Indeed not.


942
0:49:57,0 --> 0:49:59,83
I am not at all surprised.


943
0:49:59,83 --> 0:50:0,917
-- HASTINGS: You're not?
-- No.


944
0:50:0,917 --> 0:50:3,667
Chief Inspector, you really
ought to look to your elocution.


945
0:50:3,667 --> 0:50:5,75
Swat me, there's nothing
wrong with my lingo.


946
0:50:5,75 --> 0:50:8,83
You see, that is exactly
the kind of expression,


947
0:50:8,83 --> 0:50:9,125
like "half a mo,"


948
0:50:9,125 --> 0:50:10,958
that brings the language
into disrepute.


949
0:50:10,958 --> 0:50:12,833
Come, Hastings.


950
0:50:12,833 --> 0:50:16,542
I shall lend to
the Chief Inspector


951
0:50:16,542 --> 0:50:18,625
my personal copy


952
0:50:18,625 --> 0:50:27,583
of "The English
As She Should Be Spoken."


953
0:50:27,583 --> 0:50:29,875
Taxi!
