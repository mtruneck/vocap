###2 EDDIE HUANG: Make sure everybody out of the shot.

###6 Vice, we need a wrangler on the next one.
###7 We need a camera C.
###9 We need a wrangler, what else?
###12 Jan need to brush his teeth.
###14 Jan, your breath stink.
###16 Oh, Escalades with the scooters attached on the
###18 sides, like some on Batman and Robin shit.
###21 No, I'm just fucking around, because we don't even need
###22 this footage, in case I say something funny, dude.
###25 I mean, it could happen sometime, fucking dickhead.
###29 DAVID: I would like to hear, though, like, we came here and
###32 we have to--
###32 EDDIE HUANG: Why don't you just host the show?
###34 Like, instead of telling me to say what you
###36 would like to hear--
###39 DAVID: Let's go.
###41 Right so we came all the way to Taiwan, and I just think
###45 that you can't come here without eating stinky tofu.
###47 It's something I grew up with when I was a kid.
###48 It's something you don't have in the States.
###50 You probably don't really know anything about it.
###52 It's something that is very, very specific and
###53 official for me.
###54 So I think right now we're going to go try that.
###57 EDDIE HUANG: Official!

###83 EDDIE HUANG: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###85 
###96 Shen Keng is originally not known just for its stank tofu,
###101 but it's known for tofu in general.
###103 Because the water has a flavor of coal.
###106 It has the essence of coal.
###107 So it gives it a little kind of smokey charcoal flavor in
###112 the food, especially the tofu that they
###114 make with this water.
###115 So it's called stinky tofu.
###117 I call it stank tofu.
###118 But proper is stinky tofu, chou doufu.
###120 
###125 So watch what happens when I press down on this.
###127 Look how tender this tofu is.
###129 Look at that.
###130 That tofu is silky, dude, it just falls out.
###134 For anyone that's like, I don't like tofu, I don't eat
###136 tofu, I beg you, look at this.
###138 Taste this.
###140 When you have good tofu, it can take on the flavor of coal
###143 through the water.
###145 It has leather.
###145 It has tannins.
###147 It has umami that you can't even get in animal proteins.
###151 Right?
###152 And tofu, you can do dishes that let the essence of the
###155 tofu speak for itself, like this one.
###158 And it's just a touch of lard and some shallot soup, right.
###162 You could have this one, where you get the very stinky tofu,
###166 and you combat it with sesame oil, sugar, rice wine, soy,
###171 basil, and garlic.
###172 Give it the aromatics, and ginger, and they come together
###175 for a very deep, powerful dish.
###176 You could do a coal.
###178 And this is regular flavored silken tofu.
###181 This took on the flavor of the tea.
###183 What this dish is showcasing is the tea.
###185 And the funkiness is coming from the
###186 thousand year old egg.
###187 So this is just cooking science, right?
###191 I love this.
###192 Because every dish has to have these elements.
###195 But they're choosing which vehicle to bring those
###198 elements out.
###199 They're choosing which ones to showcase in every dish.
###203 And it's fucking amazing how this entire restaurant is
###205 specializing in tofu.
###206 And they're just firing on all cylinders and showing you the
###210 versatility.
###211 It's really fucking cool.
###213 It's like the Randall Cunningham tofu restaurant.
###215 There's not one way to play quarterback.
###216 There's not one way to cook.
###218 There's not one way to eat tofu.
###219 And this is living proof, man.
###221 This is fucking on fire.
###222 
###226 
###238 -How did that happen?
###239 
###242 EDDIE HUANG: So this is called gua sha.
###244 And he's scraping me.
###245 Gua sha is kind of a diagnostic step.
###248 When you gua sha, it will show you where the injuries are in
###251 your body, and where there's issues with your muscles or
###254 nerves or pressure points.
###258 Like this one hurts a lot.
###259 And then he will target those areas.
###263 Doing the ba guan is very, very good for relieving the
###266 pressure in your pressure points, circulation.
###269 And also, that's how your body has healing, is blood brings
###273 the nutrients.
###274 And blood circulation health with all sorts
###276 of healing and immunity.
###278 So if you have a cold, if you have the flu, headache, this
###282 is a very good thing to come do.
###284 
###298 
###308 EDDIE HUANG: Shorty at home, you know who you are, the kids
###310 going to be sleeping like this.
###313 I've had MRIs.
###314 I've had x-rays and things like that.
###316 This guy, just by using this instrument and gua sha, he was
###321 able to see things that cost thousands of
###324 dollars on the MRI x-ray.
###326 And he also gave me the added bonus telling me that's what's
###328 affecting my stomach and intestines.
###331 Now, I want viewers to know this is not voodoo.
###333 This is not some cult.
###334 This is thousands, 5,000 years of Eastern medicine.
###339 And it's not better than Western medicine.
###341 They are very good used in conjunction.
###343 
###356 
###360 
###364 EDDIE HUANG: So the first step in a tea ceremony, pour hot
###367 water over your teapot.
###369 The reason he's getting it hot is because the clay will react
###372 to the heat.
###372 So that's the amount of tea that you would put into a pot
###374 like, about one fifth.
###377 He poured in 100 degrees Celsius boiling
###379 water into the pot.
###380 Then he let it sit like maybe two seconds, and
###383 then dumped it off.
###384 So a lot of the things we do, whether it's cooking, whether
###387 it's drinking tea, you throw out the first.
###390 And you see how he is constantly seasoning his pots
###393 with the first that he's throwing out?
###394 He's pouring the tea over the pots.
###396 He's seasoning them.
###397 And it's that overflow with the 100 degrees Celsius water,
###400 push it down, and then let it hang out.
###403 
###408 And you see the color of it, it's like light golden color.
###411 
###419 
###434 EDDIE HUANG: Just like you'd smell the nose on a wine.
###437 
###447 
###452 Before we left Taiwan, I had to take you to
###455 [FOREIGN LANGUAGE], Old Street.
###458 And not to be nostalgic about the past, or not to be like,
###462 it was better back then, or be really somber about it.
###465 But just to show you this is a 5,000 year old culture.
###469 The medicine is different.
###471 We have a different way of life.
###473 And it's not better.
###474 It's not worse.
###475 It's just what it is.
###476 And then lastly I wanted to show you how tea, in a lot of
###480 ways, is similar to wine, and how stinky tofu
###483 is similar to cheese.
###484 If there's one thing to learn from "Fresh Off the Boat" it's
###487 no culture is better or worse than another.
###490 
###493 It just is, all right?
###496 "Fresh Off the Boat," with Eddie Huang.
###497 Taipei, we love you.
###498 We out.
