ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: It's
springtime here in South


3
0:0:5,28 --> 0:0:8,39
Africa, and we've experienced
amazingly great weather.


4
0:0:8,39 --> 0:0:9,87
We were filming yesterday
afternoon.


5
0:0:9,87 --> 0:0:11,9
And I turned around and noticed
the clouds were coming


6
0:0:11,9 --> 0:0:15,28
in, baroning in these big,
fierce, black clouds.


7
0:0:15,28 --> 0:0:18,33
Within the space of about 30
seconds from sunshine, these


8
0:0:18,33 --> 0:0:22,88
golf-ball-like hailstones fell
out of the sky and just, like,


9
0:0:22,88 --> 0:0:25,76
pounding down on the ground.


10
0:0:25,76 --> 0:0:27,65
It's sounded like people
were throwing


11
0:0:27,65 --> 0:0:28,327
rocks at the vehicles.

[HAIL STRIKING METAL]


13
0:0:38,28 --> 0:0:40,71
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Krishna and
I are here to meet a group of


14
0:0:40,71 --> 0:0:42,67
new upcoming DJs who--


15
0:0:42,67 --> 0:0:44,66
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Oh, they're
called JKN Productions.


16
0:0:44,66 --> 0:0:45,36
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Thank you.


17
0:0:45,36 --> 0:0:47,145
The reason they've asked us to
meet them here is because they


18
0:0:47,145 --> 0:0:49,67
want to treat us to some
traditional South


19
0:0:49,67 --> 0:0:50,317
African-style cuisine.


20
0:0:50,317 --> 0:0:56,974



21
0:0:56,974 --> 0:0:58,52
Guys, you ready to play?


22
0:0:58,52 --> 0:0:59,77
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU:
Yeah, let's go.
