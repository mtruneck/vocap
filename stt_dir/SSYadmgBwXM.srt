you don't have to be things that are bad
for you in order to have exited

succulent and tasty and wonderful


10
0:1:25,69 --> 0:1:30,5
if you haven't uh... tasted a lot of
things in their natural state


11
0:1:30,5 --> 0:1:35,33
being run right out and do it because
it's great i mean it's really fantastic


12
0:1:35,33 --> 0:1:39,9
and it's efficient so many people miss
out on that because the so-called


13
0:1:39,9 --> 0:1:41,21
convenience foods


14
0:1:41,21 --> 0:1:44,69
because i get up which should go i guess
change considerably in the past


15
0:1:44,69 --> 0:1:46,56
twenty five years


16
0:1:46,56 --> 0:1:50,68
until nineteen fifty we had essentially
in agriculture and food supply that is a


17
0:1:50,68 --> 0:1:52,159
situation where


18
0:1:52,159 --> 0:1:56,25
who has grown by the farmer taken to the
uh...


19
0:1:56,25 --> 0:1:57,109
boats


20
0:1:57,109 --> 0:2:0,3
unchanged by the housewife


21
0:2:0,3 --> 0:2:3,17
and cook and bake this for a family


22
0:2:3,17 --> 0:2:7,22
since nineteen fifty and increasingly
since nineteen sixty


23
0:2:7,22 --> 0:2:8,809
that we have given up


24
0:2:8,809 --> 0:2:10,899
they all week


25
0:2:10,899 --> 0:2:12,509
bush come to us


26
0:2:12,509 --> 0:2:17,799
and industrial food supplies that is one
where foods were more and more processed


27
0:2:17,799 --> 0:2:22,609
anywhere and stayed out of the food
uh... has grown being sold


28
0:2:22,609 --> 0:2:25,449
the food was in a sense my


29
0:2:25,449 --> 0:2:28,109
an entirely new


30
0:2:28,109 --> 0:2:37,159
made from it


31
0:2:37,159 --> 0:2:38,329
food itself


32
0:2:38,329 --> 0:2:40,649
is not a new idea


33
0:2:40,649 --> 0:2:42,679
new methods and processes


34
0:2:42,679 --> 0:2:56,579
are changing our reading habits with
factory food wheels and number two okay


35
0:2:56,579 --> 0:2:58,169
many of the modern


36
0:2:58,169 --> 0:2:59,65
so-called modern


37
0:2:59,65 --> 0:3:3,689
are not nearly as nutritious as the old
fashioned


38
0:3:3,689 --> 0:3:7,559
fruits and vegetables and other products
we got from


39
0:3:7,559 --> 0:3:8,179
any of these


40
0:3:8,179 --> 0:3:9,779
foods are high in sugar


41
0:3:9,779 --> 0:3:11,839
clients office


42
0:3:11,839 --> 0:3:16,419
the number of cases nutrients have been
removed from


43
0:3:16,419 --> 0:3:19,469
when he had this up the nutritional


44
0:3:19,469 --> 0:3:20,559
of the american diet


45
0:3:20,559 --> 0:3:29,199
has actually deteriorated in recent
years things are getting worse


46
0:3:29,199 --> 0:3:31,929
today so we can buy good for them


47
0:3:31,929 --> 0:3:35,29
our diets are worse than they were ten
years ago


48
0:3:35,29 --> 0:3:38,379
too many of us have health problems
because we need for me


49
0:3:38,379 --> 0:3:40,33
too many non nutritious foods


50
0:3:40,33 --> 0:3:44,799
too few vitamins and minerals


51
0:3:44,799 --> 0:3:48,169
this bad but i'm making right now is
made


52
0:3:48,169 --> 0:3:50,469
with whole wheat flour


53
0:3:50,469 --> 0:3:51,869
which is just elf


54
0:3:51,869 --> 0:3:56,76
stone ground and honey and milk and
synthetic meecham


55
0:3:56,76 --> 0:4:0,79
so if you know they will be a good but i
mean you will not only taste really


56
0:4:0,79 --> 0:4:2,609
delicious but they were ruby


57
0:4:2,609 --> 0:4:5,959
a really useful and good

0:4:5,959 --> 0:4:10,579
white bread they combined store white
leading maker so far we find in a white


59
0:4:10,579 --> 0:4:14,249
flowers have that we can we moved in
branding moved


60
0:4:14,249 --> 0:4:15,279
is


61
0:4:15,279 --> 0:4:20,919
almost entirely starch


62
0:4:20,919 --> 0:4:22,45
as food is processed


63
0:4:22,45 --> 0:4:25,99
nutrients are usually removed


64
0:4:25,99 --> 0:4:28,759
knowing of green is a glaring example


65
0:4:28,759 --> 0:4:32,38
most of the minerals and vitamins and
all week colonel are on the surface


66
0:4:32,38 --> 0:4:34,229
from the brannon outer layers


67
0:4:34,229 --> 0:4:37,86
and in the growing center calm creature


68
0:4:37,86 --> 0:4:40,99
flour made from the complete week
colonel


69
0:4:40,99 --> 0:4:41,459
all week long


70
0:4:41,459 --> 0:4:45,789
contains these nutritious parts of the
week


71
0:4:45,789 --> 0:4:48,5
but most lowered his ground

making quite plan or the week german
brand are removed


74
0:4:53,37 --> 0:4:57,66
and the major portions of many minerals
inside a man's are lost


75
0:4:57,66 --> 0:5:4,719
part of the protein and most of the
fiber are also lost


76
0:5:4,719 --> 0:5:7,85
brannon outer layers are sold for cattle


77
0:5:7,85 --> 0:5:21,559
and i will emerge


78
0:5:21,559 --> 0:5:23,8
blue bread company makes quite bridge


79
0:5:23,8 --> 0:5:32,889
they put back a few of the lawsuit


80
0:5:32,889 --> 0:5:35,59
hand-held of some of the british


81
0:5:35,59 --> 0:5:37,119
because it is in rich

the original message


84
0:5:43,879 --> 0:5:46,8
happily you don't have to buy white


85
0:5:46,8 --> 0:5:47,919
most stores have a


86
0:5:47,919 --> 0:5:53,3
variety of nutritious whole grain bread


87
0:5:53,3 --> 0:5:56,3
supposed to be


88
0:5:56,3 --> 0:5:59,599
fleets to fight by


89
0:5:59,599 --> 0:6:3,429
if i can't fake anything else


90
0:6:3,429 --> 0:6:4,99
but i thought we'd


91
0:6:4,99 --> 0:6:9,39
we have a very good


92
0:6:9,39 --> 0:6:11,39
he get at least read like this


93
0:6:11,39 --> 0:6:15,639
getting more vitamins and more efficient


94
0:6:15,639 --> 0:6:23,3
uh... white bread


95
0:6:23,3 --> 0:6:27,55
many states don't even required in
richmond for some power crowd


96
0:6:27,55 --> 0:6:38,8
nutritional loss from snacks pastries
and doughnuts maybe almost total


97
0:6:38,8 --> 0:6:42,34
rice is another one of the range from
which we managed to remove most of the


98
0:6:42,34 --> 0:6:43,75
nutritious elements


99
0:6:43,75 --> 0:6:47,349
by taking off the outer layers


100
0:6:47,349 --> 0:6:53,99
enriched quite rise has had several
vitamins and iron restored


101
0:6:53,99 --> 0:6:54,36
but brown rice


102
0:6:54,36 --> 0:6:56,86
whole grain rice that has not been
mailed


103
0:6:56,86 --> 0:6:59,61
has all the original nutrients


104
0:6:59,61 --> 0:7:2,599
the rights which advertisers urgency


105
0:7:2,599 --> 0:7:5,639
is even less nutritious than white rice


106
0:7:5,639 --> 0:7:7,68
after making instant prize


107
0:7:7,68 --> 0:7:10,819
food companies who tend to make up for
the loss of nutrients


108
0:7:10,819 --> 0:7:14,249
by dusting the grains with the vitamin
up


109
0:7:14,249 --> 0:7:18,29
such highly processed foods are
increasingly replacing more nutritious


110
0:7:18,29 --> 0:7:21,379
foods and i've died i'd like it might
look like


111
0:7:21,379 --> 0:7:23,74
my colleague hamburger helper thing


112
0:7:23,74 --> 0:7:29,579
right there were only an outback


113
0:7:29,579 --> 0:7:32,779
larry when i get home from work what am
i gonna do it if cooked up five minute


114
0:7:32,779 --> 0:7:34,87
becky everybody in that


115
0:7:34,87 --> 0:7:38,729
created by fabricate spirit and stuff we
would like to fix up might think that it


116
0:7:38,729 --> 0:7:41,19
in a long-running polly was alright


117
0:7:41,19 --> 0:7:42,539
sapo doesn't


118
0:7:42,539 --> 0:7:46,75
it goes over possible long-term
consequences to i don't think they have


119
0:7:46,75 --> 0:7:49,149
more we are hang on to do


120
0:7:49,149 --> 0:7:53,729
daily on bruce's foods and the less we
did that would supply debated by all the


121
0:7:53,729 --> 0:8:4,139
voices foods that it would be for us


122
0:8:4,139 --> 0:8:5,74
not only good for you but


123
0:8:5,74 --> 0:8:7,16
fantastically delicious


124
0:8:7,16 --> 0:8:11,1
you can be great to eat and that's the
thing about whole grains is that there


125
0:8:11,1 --> 0:8:12,169
are always


126
0:8:12,169 --> 0:8:16,18
not only much much better for you in
grains that are tampered with but


127
0:8:16,18 --> 0:8:19,59
always without exception much more
delicious


128
0:8:19,59 --> 0:8:29,309
we you know what was wrong


129
0:8:29,309 --> 0:8:31,68
sodium content


130
0:8:31,68 --> 0:8:34,91
sat over the


131
0:8:34,91 --> 0:8:38,46
facility in sterile school lacked away


132
0:8:38,46 --> 0:8:41,1
lacked the light

killian


134
0:8:43,98 --> 0:8:47,68
tomorrow morning for a which arrives


135
0:8:47,68 --> 0:8:49,35
cry potassium


136
0:8:49,35 --> 0:8:50,82
prostrate


137
0:8:50,82 --> 0:8:54,56
slowly along with the shift in the last
twenty years highly refined and


138
0:8:54,56 --> 0:8:56,32
processed foods


139
0:8:56,32 --> 0:9:2,5
there's been an enormous increase in the
use of food additives


140
0:9:2,5 --> 0:9:5,67
a typical instant mashed potato package
s potatoes


141
0:9:5,67 --> 0:9:12,47
but also these ingredients day


142
0:9:12,47 --> 0:9:16,2
breakfast cake as trigger for water and
shortening


143
0:9:16,2 --> 0:9:25,99
but also ca


144
0:9:25,99 --> 0:9:29,22
a package salad dressing as all these
ingredients


145
0:9:29,22 --> 0:9:36,16
xx


146
0:9:36,16 --> 0:9:37,47
their diets


147
0:9:37,47 --> 0:9:42,15
but first bleach is amal suppliers
preservatives flavors morse directions


148
0:9:42,15 --> 0:9:45,68
and so forth


149
0:9:45,68 --> 0:9:52,69
doesn't have a little bit earlier today


150
0:9:52,69 --> 0:9:55,46
one reason companies like to use these
attitudes


151
0:9:55,46 --> 0:9:58,98
is because it helps sales and profits


152
0:9:58,98 --> 0:10:3,28
using preservatives mall suppliers and
stabilizers food manufacturers can


153
0:10:3,28 --> 0:10:8,25
concoct completely new products like
putting caps


154
0:10:8,25 --> 0:10:11,3
bheji mph thier added to potato chips


155
0:10:11,3 --> 0:10:16,62
so packages can sit on the shelf for
three months without going straight


156
0:10:16,62 --> 0:10:19,9
artificial flavors are used in ice cream


157
0:10:19,9 --> 0:10:23,33
because they are much cheaper than
natural flavors


158
0:10:23,33 --> 0:10:29,15
caramel coloring makes white bread
looked like whole wheat bread


159
0:10:29,15 --> 0:10:33,1
egg bread is dyed yellow to make it look
rich in eggs


160
0:10:33,1 --> 0:10:36,97
and a frozen breakfast drink imitates
real orange juice with the aid of an


161
0:10:36,97 --> 0:10:39,36
orange dot


162
0:10:39,36 --> 0:10:42,4
it's all imitation of the real work
right


163
0:10:42,4 --> 0:10:43,9
and there's nothing


164
0:10:43,9 --> 0:11:0,99
you know that's is versions of beautiful
finely is the real thing


165
0:11:0,99 --> 0:11:4,0
there's controversy over the use of some
attitudes however


166
0:11:4,0 --> 0:11:8,3
because they're potentially dangerous to
our help


167
0:11:8,3 --> 0:11:10,96
it's not necessarily the case that
attitudes are always bear


168
0:11:10,96 --> 0:11:12,69
that certainly isn't


169
0:11:12,69 --> 0:11:15,36
but many attitude survey useful purposes


170
0:11:15,36 --> 0:11:18,5
for instance the addition of vitamin


171
0:11:18,5 --> 0:11:19,71
is is very useful


172
0:11:19,71 --> 0:11:25,22
it getting high tax office has been very
useful in preventing


173
0:11:25,22 --> 0:11:27,75
we have to be very careful about
attitudes


174
0:11:27,75 --> 0:11:31,24
because the turns out that anyone
additive


175
0:11:31,24 --> 0:11:32,39
very dangerous


176
0:11:32,39 --> 0:11:33,85
that could mean higher


177
0:11:33,85 --> 0:11:36,31
a tremendous number of people


178
0:11:36,31 --> 0:11:38,89
and down through the years many
additives


179
0:11:38,89 --> 0:11:40,49
and found to be dangerous


180
0:11:40,49 --> 0:11:42,91
most of these is an artificial colors


181
0:11:42,91 --> 0:11:44,34
so i think if there's any


182
0:11:44,34 --> 0:11:47,59
any worry we should be worrying about
artificial colors


183
0:11:47,59 --> 0:11:51,91
they've been found to cause allergic
reactions


184
0:11:51,91 --> 0:11:53,82
and damage of several


185
0:11:53,82 --> 0:11:58,83
uh... internal organs like liver and
heart


186
0:11:58,83 --> 0:12:2,82
one controversy or who died that was
once widely used


187
0:12:2,82 --> 0:12:4,82
is red number two


188
0:12:4,82 --> 0:12:7,63
it was the most common of all food items


189
0:12:7,63 --> 0:12:9,75
all of us consumed it


190
0:12:9,75 --> 0:12:14,36
yet it has now been banned because it
was found to be dangerous to our help


191
0:12:14,36 --> 0:12:18,2
other red does have been substituted for
it


192
0:12:18,2 --> 0:12:21,32
hundreds of foods are colored with red
dot


193
0:12:21,32 --> 0:12:23,23
the does make them look good


194
0:12:23,23 --> 0:12:25,93
they help sales


195
0:12:25,93 --> 0:12:30,79
a


196
0:12:30,79 --> 0:12:33,35
it


197
0:12:33,35 --> 0:12:41,73
boone


198
0:12:41,73 --> 0:12:44,96
right


199
0:12:44,96 --> 0:12:48,97
right


200
0:12:48,97 --> 0:12:52,92
there are other evidence which are also
controversy


201
0:12:52,92 --> 0:12:56,17
political opponents comic


202
0:12:56,17 --> 0:12:59,2
in small print you'll find the words
sodium nitrite this is one of the


203
0:12:59,2 --> 0:13:0,17
attitudes


204
0:13:0,17 --> 0:13:1,71
to stay away from


205
0:13:1,71 --> 0:13:4,31
sodium nitrite itself wasn't so great


206
0:13:4,31 --> 0:13:5,64
problem arises


207
0:13:5,64 --> 0:13:9,71
went sodium nitrite reacts with other
chemicals either in the


208
0:13:9,71 --> 0:13:10,87
a radar summary


209
0:13:10,87 --> 0:13:13,2
to create nitrosamines


210
0:13:13,2 --> 0:13:15,31
tiny amounts of nitrosamines


211
0:13:15,31 --> 0:13:19,49
have been found to cause cancer in
animals


212
0:13:19,49 --> 0:13:23,46
food processors say sodium nitrite is
needed for tearing me


213
0:13:23,46 --> 0:13:27,69
and to prevent botulism bacteria from
growing


214
0:13:27,69 --> 0:13:31,32
off limits you simply to give meets a
bright pinkish color to increase their


215
0:13:31,32 --> 0:13:33,69
sales appeal


216
0:13:33,69 --> 0:13:39,79
many scientists and others think it
should be banned for this purpose


217
0:13:39,79 --> 0:13:46,39
one place where it is definitely
unnecessary is invading


218
0:13:46,39 --> 0:13:50,73
a few years ago another added mono
sodium gluconate m_s_g_


219
0:13:50,73 --> 0:13:53,29
was widely used in baby foods


220
0:13:53,29 --> 0:13:57,75
the purpose was to increase sales by
making the food more tasty to mothers


221
0:13:57,75 --> 0:14:1,9
when doubts arose about the safety of
the mystery for babies


222
0:14:1,9 --> 0:14:4,5
the manufacturers fought against
removing


223
0:14:4,5 --> 0:14:6,4
eventually they were forced to


224
0:14:6,4 --> 0:14:12,3
there was no need for to have been there
in the first place


225
0:14:12,3 --> 0:14:15,93
each have a stake in an average of five
pounds of that it is a year


226
0:14:15,93 --> 0:14:21,56
some clearly serve no legitimate need
and should be eliminated from our food


227
0:14:21,56 --> 0:14:25,25
we need to be very carefully and i think
they've been dignity


228
0:14:25,25 --> 0:14:27,61
indefinite multiplication


229
0:14:27,61 --> 0:14:32,1
of any busy now put you brian we have
more than two thousand now


230
0:14:32,1 --> 0:14:35,7
on the other end today in the morning
discriminatory act


231
0:14:35,7 --> 0:14:40,67
it is that you be ignorant of the fact
that in some cases they increase rylan


232
0:14:40,67 --> 0:14:47,3
decrease the safety of the food supply


233
0:14:47,3 --> 0:14:50,33
still another change in our reading
habits as the high percentage of sugar


234
0:14:50,33 --> 0:14:51,82
in our diet


235
0:14:51,82 --> 0:14:56,97
by eating a lot of sugar we invite tooth
decay and other health problems


236
0:14:56,97 --> 0:15:1,32
yet many of us have a sweet tooth and
food processors are happy to encourage


237
0:15:1,32 --> 0:15:3,18
it


238
0:15:3,18 --> 0:15:3,9
why don't they


239
0:15:3,9 --> 0:15:6,88
keep out the email i promise you that
they have been in that because their


240
0:15:6,88 --> 0:15:7,699
statements


241
0:15:7,699 --> 0:15:8,82
secure again


242
0:15:8,82 --> 0:15:10,45
hidden instead


243
0:15:10,45 --> 0:15:14,55
had something terrible and tragic
accident and tomato crop


244
0:15:14,55 --> 0:15:17,61
their father security and feel


245
0:15:17,61 --> 0:15:24,38
incident this property is right kidney
have civilian week about a hundred and


246
0:15:24,38 --> 0:15:27,73
and parking around


247
0:15:27,73 --> 0:15:30,81
secured and year replace them


248
0:15:30,81 --> 0:15:42,29
tonight since i'm not a shipping is
officially and beverages


249
0:15:42,29 --> 0:15:45,439
a twelve ounce bottle of america's
favorite soft drink


250
0:15:45,439 --> 0:15:50,4
has seven


251
0:15:50,4 --> 0:15:55,7
nine teaspoons of sugar


252
0:15:55,7 --> 0:15:57,59
americans are on the sugar drink bench


253
0:15:57,59 --> 0:16:5,7
week annually consume more sugar drinks
than milk and fruit juices combined


254
0:16:5,7 --> 0:16:7,69
peaches or do dessert


255
0:16:7,69 --> 0:16:15,6
when they're packed in a heavy syrup you
get forty spoons of sugar per serving


256
0:16:15,6 --> 0:16:20,33
in many cases we have substituted sugar
based products for more nutritious wants


257
0:16:20,33 --> 0:16:23,25
artificially colored and flavored
breakfast ranks


258
0:16:23,25 --> 0:16:24,8
have not only more sugar


259
0:16:24,8 --> 0:16:31,8
but fewer vitamins and none of the
minerals that real fruit juices hair


260
0:16:31,8 --> 0:16:34,51
ingredients in food are listed in order
by weight


261
0:16:34,51 --> 0:17:8,46
if shivers first it means it's the
largest items


262
0:17:8,46 --> 0:17:13,54
some breakfast cereals are almost fifty
percent


263
0:17:13,54 --> 0:17:16,19
i like


264
0:17:16,19 --> 0:17:18,91
contract yet


265
0:17:18,91 --> 0:17:22,89
shantytowns


266
0:17:22,89 --> 0:17:24,64
carey's here


267
0:17:24,64 --> 0:17:26,8
i don't do this


268
0:17:26,8 --> 0:17:29,9
they didn't report


269
0:17:29,9 --> 0:17:32,97
we need to use headed to note


270
0:17:32,97 --> 0:17:38,28
are likely to gamble


271
0:17:38,28 --> 0:17:48,79
yeah i think if you could say that i'm
typing doing now


272
0:17:48,79 --> 0:17:55,16
pressured rock break that you can


273
0:17:55,16 --> 0:17:58,47
cabinet


274
0:17:58,47 --> 0:18:1,4
can


275
0:18:1,4 --> 0:18:2,67
hahha


276
0:18:2,67 --> 0:18:3,95
very tasty


277
0:18:3,95 --> 0:18:8,6
who can't laugh at satisfied because
like it can see that had sent a c


278
0:18:8,6 --> 0:18:11,68
and if there's settlements that they get
the first debate


279
0:18:11,68 --> 0:18:14,37
an intent to santa monica and i think
talk about


280
0:18:14,37 --> 0:18:21,46
i've turned into a fight with supply and
trying to improve are provided


281
0:18:21,46 --> 0:18:24,38
have come out of typing media


282
0:18:24,38 --> 0:18:29,83
uh... kibuye these products frank


283
0:18:29,83 --> 0:18:33,25
to again today saying its considerable
means about one and a half billion


284
0:18:33,25 --> 0:18:35,9
dollars on media about


285
0:18:35,9 --> 0:18:38,279
three billion dollars both though


286
0:18:38,279 --> 0:18:42,6
packets is a very different function
from advertising in general


287
0:18:42,6 --> 0:18:47,7
acting general advertising actin stupid
increase consumption a certain goods and


288
0:18:47,7 --> 0:18:50,62
then shift preference to seven brands


289
0:18:50,62 --> 0:18:54,55
in the case of food however the total
amount of full would you believe these


290
0:18:54,55 --> 0:18:57,95
independent of the amount of advertising
you see


291
0:18:57,95 --> 0:19:0,33
all of the pacing does these shifts


292
0:19:0,33 --> 0:19:5,11
your food supply for you putting take
from one type of food to another


293
0:19:5,11 --> 0:19:8,67
we can bring consumes in four different
groups with nutrition declining from


294
0:19:8,67 --> 0:19:10,89
group to group


295
0:19:10,89 --> 0:19:12,94
and the first group would be


296
0:19:12,94 --> 0:19:16,74
vegetables fruits eggs milk cheese meat


297
0:19:16,74 --> 0:19:18,67
and hope we products


298
0:19:18,67 --> 0:19:20,19
and the second


299
0:19:20,19 --> 0:19:22,98
white bread potatoes macaroni products


300
0:19:22,98 --> 0:19:24,99
some of the better breakfast cereals


301
0:19:24,99 --> 0:19:26,41
and soups


302
0:19:26,41 --> 0:19:27,419
and the third


303
0:19:27,419 --> 0:19:30,2
and now a nutritional value is going
down rapidly


304
0:19:30,2 --> 0:19:33,39
suru coated breakfast cereals some snack
foods


305
0:19:33,39 --> 0:19:35,61
cake mixes and so forth


306
0:19:35,61 --> 0:19:37,69
and in the fourth


307
0:19:37,69 --> 0:19:40,91
soft drinks and many snack foods


308
0:19:40,91 --> 0:19:44,76
however if we hate these foods in
proportion to the advertising given to


309
0:19:44,76 --> 0:19:45,56
them


310
0:19:45,56 --> 0:19:52,3
this is how much we might need from each
group uh...


311
0:19:52,3 --> 0:20:12,16
we're


312
0:20:12,16 --> 0:20:15,809
within their big break down of the event
that is in really the issue


313
0:20:15,809 --> 0:20:19,18
tried to shift the food preferences of
americans


314
0:20:19,18 --> 0:20:23,57
from the better foolish to the worst
foods and i'm afraid very successful at


315
0:20:23,57 --> 0:20:28,25
the all the date that we have on the
nutrient consumption by the american


316
0:20:28,25 --> 0:20:30,1
people to show that since


317
0:20:30,1 --> 0:20:33,69
nineteen fifty-five there's been a
really beat deregulation


318
0:20:33,69 --> 0:20:37,34
eating the food supply yes consumed and
i think that the banking very


319
0:20:37,34 --> 0:20:42,28
responsible


320
0:20:42,28 --> 0:20:44,8
we have a choice


321
0:20:44,8 --> 0:20:48,58
we can eat the factory foods that are
pushed on this by advertising


322
0:20:48,58 --> 0:20:54,48
or we can save money any better with
more unprocessed natural foods


323
0:20:54,48 --> 0:20:56,66
there


324
0:20:56,66 --> 0:21:3,25
yell


325
0:21:3,25 --> 0:23:3,25
aravind crowd
