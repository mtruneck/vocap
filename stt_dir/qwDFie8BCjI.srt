[MUSIC PLAYING]


3
0:0:11,247 --> 0:0:14,61
DAVID CHOE: In the end,
only kindness matters.


4
0:0:14,61 --> 0:0:16,59
That's what Jewel says.


5
0:0:16,59 --> 0:0:19,17
And this is where she's going
to be playing, at the


6
0:0:19,17 --> 0:0:24,755
Horseshoe Casino Hotel in
beautiful Tunica, Mississippi.


7
0:0:24,755 --> 0:0:26,11
And not to be a cocktease--


8
0:0:26,11 --> 0:0:28,59
I have absolutely no desire
to see Jewel.


9
0:0:28,59 --> 0:0:30,6
I'm here to gamble
with some money.


10
0:0:30,6 --> 0:0:33,5
Got a cash advance on
my credit card.


11
0:0:33,5 --> 0:0:35,2
I need to buy a boat.


12
0:0:35,2 --> 0:0:36,434
I want to go down the
Mississippi River.


13
0:0:36,434 --> 0:0:40,5



14
0:0:40,5 --> 0:0:41,3
Thumbs up, America.


15
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:47,256



16
0:0:47,256 --> 0:0:51,5
Hate to do the obnoxious money
shot, but, 20 minutes later,


17
0:0:51,5 --> 0:0:53,5
nice hand at the blackjack
tables with


18
0:0:53,5 --> 0:0:55,32
Jeff, the dealer, and--


19
0:0:55,32 --> 0:0:58,52
looks like I got some
boat money.


20
0:0:58,52 --> 0:1:3,82
Hate to be a fucking prick,
but you know how it goes.


21
0:1:3,82 --> 0:1:6,79
Ready for a nice boat
ride, Harry?


22
0:1:6,79 --> 0:1:6,65
HARRY (OFFSCREEN):
Let's do it.


23
0:1:6,65 --> 0:1:7,3
To win some, you lose some.


24
0:1:7,3 --> 0:1:8,52
DAVID CHOE: Tunica,
Mississippi.


25
0:1:8,52 --> 0:1:10,49
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.


26
0:1:10,49 --> 0:1:11,875
HARRY: It's time you won.


27
0:1:11,875 --> 0:1:13,33
Let's do it.


28
0:1:13,33 --> 0:1:22,545



29
0:1:22,545 --> 0:1:25,51
DAVID CHOE: Benny, who's wearing
a shirt that says


30
0:1:25,51 --> 0:1:28,5
Benny Thompson, but it's
actually not him, just came


31
0:1:28,5 --> 0:1:31,74
out here to warn us that a
lady complained about--


32
0:1:31,74 --> 0:1:33,625
BENNY: And she thought
y'all were some


33
0:1:33,625 --> 0:1:34,34
terrorists or something.


34
0:1:34,34 --> 0:1:35,14
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): She
thought we were terrorists


35
0:1:35,14 --> 0:1:36,28
because we're backpacked
and we're foreigners.


36
0:1:36,28 --> 0:1:37,5
BENNY: Yeah.


37
0:1:37,5 --> 0:1:37,42
DAVID CHOE: All right.


38
0:1:37,42 --> 0:1:39,95
What are they saying exactly?


39
0:1:39,95 --> 0:1:42,67
There's foreigners out there
that look like terrorists?


40
0:1:42,67 --> 0:1:44,2
BENNY: Yeah, but you
don't though.


41
0:1:44,2 --> 0:1:46,484
DAVID CHOE: Bin Laden's
cousin.


42
0:1:46,484 --> 0:1:49,72
BENNY: [INAUDIBLE].


43
0:1:49,72 --> 0:1:51,52
Where y'all hiking to?


44
0:1:51,52 --> 0:1:53,4
HARRY: Well we want to go
to Greenville tonight.


45
0:1:53,4 --> 0:1:53,79
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Well,
the only reason why we might


46
0:1:53,79 --> 0:1:55,51
want to go to Greenville is
there's a Walmart there, and


47
0:1:55,51 --> 0:1:57,54
there's an inflatable
raft at the Walmart


48
0:1:57,54 --> 0:1:58,75
that's waiting for us.


49
0:1:58,75 --> 0:1:59,39
I want a boat.


50
0:1:59,39 --> 0:2:1,82
I want to take a boat down
the Mississippi River.


51
0:2:1,82 --> 0:2:2,92
A little boat.


52
0:2:2,92 --> 0:2:3,59
Not a big boat.


53
0:2:3,59 --> 0:2:4,396
BENNY: In the Mississippi
River?


54
0:2:4,396 --> 0:2:5,87
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
in the Mississippi River.


55
0:2:5,87 --> 0:2:7,276
BENNY: What are y'all
smoking on, man?


56
0:2:7,276 --> 0:2:8,505
You're talking about-- you're
going to get crushed in that


57
0:2:8,505 --> 0:2:8,695
river, man.


58
0:2:8,695 --> 0:2:9,9
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
From what?


59
0:2:9,9 --> 0:2:10,74
It's of water, man.


60
0:2:10,74 --> 0:2:12,386
BENNY: Man, that's the most
dangerous river in the world.


61
0:2:12,386 --> 0:2:12,54
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Why?


62
0:2:12,54 --> 0:2:13,685
Why is it dangerous?


63
0:2:13,685 --> 0:2:15,76
BENNY: There's holes, sinkholes,
and all kind of


64
0:2:15,76 --> 0:2:16,14
stuff like that.


65
0:2:16,14 --> 0:2:16,73
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
What's a sinkhole?


66
0:2:16,73 --> 0:2:20,37
BENNY: It's a sinkhole when a
barge comes up down the river,


67
0:2:20,37 --> 0:2:21,99
and it wipes you on the
side of it, man.


68
0:2:21,99 --> 0:2:23,8
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, wow.


69
0:2:23,8 --> 0:2:25,0
And have you gone swimming
in the Mississippi River?


70
0:2:25,0 --> 0:2:25,968
BENNY: No.


71
0:2:25,968 --> 0:2:26,815
Anybody's gonna be swimming
[INAUDIBLE]:?


72
0:2:26,815 --> 0:2:28,782
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Have you
known anyone that's swam


73
0:2:28,782 --> 0:2:28,98
in the river?


74
0:2:28,98 --> 0:2:29,41
BENNY: No.


75
0:2:29,41 --> 0:2:30,42
I know a couple guys--


76
0:2:30,42 --> 0:2:31,16
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): So
you're from Mississippi and


77
0:2:31,16 --> 0:2:32,59
you don't know anyone
who's ever swam in


78
0:2:32,59 --> 0:2:32,98
the Mississippi River?


79
0:2:32,98 --> 0:2:33,782
BENNY: No.


80
0:2:33,782 --> 0:2:34,79
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): All
right, I'll find a boat.


81
0:2:34,79 --> 0:2:35,64
BENNY: OK, I'll tell--


82
0:2:35,64 --> 0:2:36,96
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): I'm
going to sail down the


83
0:2:36,96 --> 0:2:38,14
Mississippi River.


84
0:2:38,14 --> 0:2:39,69
I'm going to ditch
the sinkholes.


85
0:2:39,69 --> 0:2:40,93
I'm going to ditch
the undercurrent.


86
0:2:40,93 --> 0:2:41,813
I'm going to ditch the sewage.


87
0:2:41,813 --> 0:2:42,54
BENNY: All right.


88
0:2:42,54 --> 0:2:43,79
I only heard of Huckleberry
Finn.


89
0:2:43,79 --> 0:2:46,33



90
0:2:46,33 --> 0:2:48,5
DAVID CHOE: I'll be your
Huckleberry Finn.


91
0:2:48,5 --> 0:2:49,46
How about a ride?


92
0:2:49,46 --> 0:2:50,61
How bout a lift?


93
0:2:50,61 --> 0:2:51,1
Come on.


94
0:2:51,1 --> 0:2:51,79
BENNY: I ain't got time.


95
0:2:51,79 --> 0:2:52,155
I got work to do.


96
0:2:52,155 --> 0:2:53,45
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Where's
your truck, Benny?


97
0:2:53,45 --> 0:2:54,392
BENNY: My truck's right there.


98
0:2:54,392 --> 0:2:55,34
DAVID CHOE: Give me
a fucking ride.


99
0:2:55,34 --> 0:2:56,51
BENNY: My truck's right there.


100
0:2:56,51 --> 0:2:57,86
DAVID CHOE: Let's go talk
about it in the truck.


101
0:2:57,86 --> 0:2:59,54
Benny's totally fucking
with us right now.


102
0:2:59,54 --> 0:3:1,86
Pointed at his truck and said it
was a white guy truck, then


103
0:3:1,86 --> 0:3:3,28
told us it's really his truck.


104
0:3:3,28 --> 0:3:3,79
BENNY: It's my truck.


105
0:3:3,79 --> 0:3:6,72
DAVID CHOE: It's obvious Benny
has a high sex drive.


106
0:3:6,72 --> 0:3:9,0
He has his own custom
Ford sticker with a


107
0:3:9,0 --> 0:3:11,53
naked woman on it.


108
0:3:11,53 --> 0:3:12,16
Benny.


109
0:3:12,16 --> 0:3:13,28
BENNY: He's cool, man.


110
0:3:13,28 --> 0:3:14,175
Hooks me up with everything,
man.


111
0:3:14,175 --> 0:3:15,36
Clothes.


112
0:3:15,36 --> 0:3:16,61
Shoes.


113
0:3:16,61 --> 0:3:29,8



114
0:3:29,8 --> 0:3:30,33
DAVID CHOE: Let's
go, let's go.


115
0:3:30,33 --> 0:3:33,5



116
0:3:33,5 --> 0:3:34,75
Bye, Benny.


117
0:3:34,75 --> 0:3:39,69



118
0:3:39,69 --> 0:3:40,94
Thank you, sir.


119
0:3:40,94 --> 0:3:43,65



120
0:3:43,65 --> 0:3:45,48
Yeah, let's go, let's go.


121
0:3:45,48 --> 0:3:46,93
Yeah, let's do it.


122
0:3:46,93 --> 0:3:48,24
Oh, my god.


123
0:3:48,24 --> 0:3:49,843
You are crazy, sir.


124
0:3:49,843 --> 0:3:52,158
This is the best ride ever.


125
0:3:52,158 --> 0:3:54,93
We're in Tunica, Mississippi.


126
0:3:54,93 --> 0:3:56,25
Just jumped in a fucking limo.


127
0:3:56,25 --> 0:3:56,92
HARRY: Limo!


128
0:3:56,92 --> 0:3:58,421
DAVID CHOE: And we're
going to Walmart.


129
0:3:58,421 --> 0:4:2,63



130
0:4:2,63 --> 0:4:3,9
Wow.


131
0:4:3,9 --> 0:4:5,284
And the lights are changing.


132
0:4:5,284 --> 0:4:7,247
What's your name, sir?


133
0:4:7,247 --> 0:4:8,241
LENNY HILL: Lenny Hill.


134
0:4:8,241 --> 0:4:9,84
DAVID CHOE: Lenny Hill?


135
0:4:9,84 --> 0:4:11,145
Thank you so much
for the ride.


136
0:4:11,145 --> 0:4:12,888
This is the best ride ever.


137
0:4:12,888 --> 0:4:15,19
We thought we were going to
get a ride with Benny, and


138
0:4:15,19 --> 0:4:18,329
next thing you know, we get a
ride with Lenny Hill, in the


139
0:4:18,329 --> 0:4:20,649
fucking limo, heading over to
Walmart, Tunica, Mississippi.


140
0:4:20,649 --> 0:4:21,314
HARRY: Wow.


141
0:4:21,314 --> 0:4:23,37
Thumbs up, America.


142
0:4:23,37 --> 0:4:24,62
Dreams do come true.


143
0:4:24,62 --> 0:4:32,2



144
0:4:32,2 --> 0:4:35,0
DAVID CHOE: Lenny, thank
you so much, sir.


145
0:4:35,0 --> 0:4:35,977
LENNY HILL: All right, hope
you enjoyed yourselves.


146
0:4:35,977 --> 0:4:36,19
DAVID CHOE: Yes.


147
0:4:36,19 --> 0:4:37,465
I enjoyed it, too.


148
0:4:37,465 --> 0:4:38,5
Are you from out here?


149
0:4:38,5 --> 0:4:39,47
LENNY HILL: Yeah.


150
0:4:39,47 --> 0:4:42,5
DAVID CHOE: Lenny, we were
standing out there for no less


151
0:4:42,5 --> 0:4:46,55
than 10 minutes in front of a
gas station when Benny, the


152
0:4:46,55 --> 0:4:49,84
guy you saw us talking to, his
employer came out and told us,


153
0:4:49,84 --> 0:4:51,565
two women came in and complained
that they saw


154
0:4:51,565 --> 0:4:55,33
foreigners wearing backpacks,
and that we were terrorists,


155
0:4:55,33 --> 0:4:56,73
and that they were going to
call the police on us.


156
0:4:56,73 --> 0:4:57,37
LENNY HILL: Oh, my lord.


157
0:4:57,37 --> 0:4:58,73
DAVID CHOE: And then you came
in and you saved the day.


158
0:4:58,73 --> 0:4:59,46
You got us out of town.


159
0:4:59,46 --> 0:5:2,52
LENNY HILL: Well, you don't look
like terrorists to me.


160
0:5:2,52 --> 0:5:5,12
DAVID CHOE: And at any point
during this ride, were you


161
0:5:5,12 --> 0:5:7,19
scared of your life?


162
0:5:7,19 --> 0:5:9,935
At any point in this ride, did
you have any weird sexual


163
0:5:9,935 --> 0:5:11,7
feelings towards me or Harry?


164
0:5:11,7 --> 0:5:11,246
LENNY HILL: No.


165
0:5:11,246 --> 0:5:11,69
DAVID CHOE: Nothing?


166
0:5:11,69 --> 0:5:12,53
OK.


167
0:5:12,53 --> 0:5:14,22
You're really champion.


168
0:5:14,22 --> 0:5:15,53
This was one of the
best rides ever.


169
0:5:15,53 --> 0:5:16,65
Thank you so much.


170
0:5:16,65 --> 0:5:18,56
If there was women in the
back, it would've been a


171
0:5:18,56 --> 0:5:18,786
little bit better.


172
0:5:18,786 --> 0:5:19,76
LENNY HILL: Sorry
about the women.


173
0:5:19,76 --> 0:5:21,24
DAVID CHOE: I'm not complaining
at all.


174
0:5:21,24 --> 0:5:21,91
Thank you so much, man.


175
0:5:21,91 --> 0:5:23,188
LENNY HILL: Bye bye.


176
0:5:23,188 --> 0:5:24,75
DAVID CHOE: This is
fucking amazing.


177
0:5:24,75 --> 0:5:26,17
There's a golf course
right there.


178
0:5:26,17 --> 0:5:36,6



179
0:5:36,6 --> 0:5:40,47
So here we are at hole seven
or hole number eight,


180
0:5:40,47 --> 0:5:43,64
somewhere in Mississippi golf
courses, some of the best


181
0:5:43,64 --> 0:5:45,85
places to have sex, some of
the best places to light


182
0:5:45,85 --> 0:5:47,55
fireworks, some of the best
places to just get some


183
0:5:47,55 --> 0:5:49,18
shut-eye after the
whole shut-down.


184
0:5:49,18 --> 0:5:52,26
You know, country living,
living in style.


185
0:5:52,26 --> 0:5:55,32
Cornfield right next
to the golf course.


186
0:5:55,32 --> 0:5:56,81
We're right next to
the golf course.


187
0:5:56,81 --> 0:6:0,4
We'll catch some shut-eye here
and then, we'll be off on the


188
0:6:0,4 --> 0:6:1,56
road tomorrow.


189
0:6:1,56 --> 0:6:3,76
Good night, America.


190
0:6:3,76 --> 0:6:4,326
HARRY: Peace.


191
0:6:4,326 --> 0:6:14,823



192
0:6:14,823 --> 0:6:17,64
DAVID CHOE: Day 12.


193
0:6:17,64 --> 0:6:20,66
We got our limo driver yesterday
to stop at five


194
0:6:20,66 --> 0:6:23,33
different Walmarts so that we
could find an inflatable raft


195
0:6:23,33 --> 0:6:27,77
to take down the Mississippi
River.


196
0:6:27,77 --> 0:6:30,565
And basically, everyone that we
talked to, everyone that we


197
0:6:30,565 --> 0:6:33,73
met is born and raised
in Mississippi.


198
0:6:33,73 --> 0:6:35,78
They know of people that have
actually swam in the


199
0:6:35,78 --> 0:6:37,94
Mississippi River but
they all died.


200
0:6:37,94 --> 0:6:42,24
And no Sport Mart, no sporting
goods store, no Walmart


201
0:6:42,24 --> 0:6:47,26
actually sells an inflatable
raft because it's a fucking


202
0:6:47,26 --> 0:6:48,61
stupid idea.


203
0:6:48,61 --> 0:6:51,46
There's sinkholes, there's a
strong undercurrent, and


204
0:6:51,46 --> 0:6:53,98
nobody really takes a
raft down the river.


205
0:6:53,98 --> 0:6:57,65
And so the closest we could find
is the Monster Deck Tube.


206
0:6:57,65 --> 0:7:0,426
And I imagine our adventure
down the Mississippi River


207
0:7:0,426 --> 0:7:3,69
will resemble this
a little bit.


208
0:7:3,69 --> 0:7:4,19
That's me.


209
0:7:4,19 --> 0:7:5,5
That's Harry.


210
0:7:5,5 --> 0:7:8,385
So, I just want to give an early
"fuck you" to everyone


211
0:7:8,385 --> 0:7:9,81
who said, "Don't do it.


212
0:7:9,81 --> 0:7:12,26
You're a fucking idiot." I'm
about to go down the


213
0:7:12,26 --> 0:7:12,71
Mississippi River.


214
0:7:12,71 --> 0:7:14,89
I'm going to have
an awesome time.


215
0:7:14,89 --> 0:7:16,14
And I'm gonna get
a killer tan.


216
0:7:16,14 --> 0:7:27,926



217
0:7:27,926 --> 0:7:31,71
DAVID CHOE: We're trying to
get down to Louisiana.


218
0:7:31,71 --> 0:7:37,569
The current seems sort of weak,
but you know, that might


219
0:7:37,569 --> 0:7:38,819
be misleading.


220
0:7:38,819 --> 0:7:58,418



221
0:7:58,418 --> 0:8:1,27
DAVID CHOE: Here we are, going
down the Mississippi River.


222
0:8:1,27 --> 0:8:3,3
Me and my buddy, Harry.


223
0:8:3,3 --> 0:8:5,45
Our camera man, Jacinto--


224
0:8:5,45 --> 0:8:8,286
great guy --had absolutely
no faith in going down


225
0:8:8,286 --> 0:8:9,57
the river with us.


226
0:8:9,57 --> 0:8:12,243
So it's just me and Harry and
our little shitty camera.


227
0:8:12,243 --> 0:8:13,493
HARRY (OFFSCREEN): Yup.


228
0:8:13,493 --> 0:8:16,88



229
0:8:16,88 --> 0:8:19,43
DAVID CHOE: All right.


230
0:8:19,43 --> 0:8:21,253
My feet are starting to
itch a little bit.


231
0:8:21,253 --> 0:8:24,11
We're going by some factory
industrial-looking thing, and


232
0:8:24,11 --> 0:8:27,84
there's some brownish-looking
water pouring into the river.


233
0:8:27,84 --> 0:8:29,97
All right, America, I gotta
start paddling, so fuck off.


234
0:8:29,97 --> 0:8:33,62



235
0:8:33,62 --> 0:8:34,279
You see that shit, dude?


236
0:8:34,279 --> 0:8:37,7
We're at least going like
five miles an hour now.


237
0:8:37,7 --> 0:8:40,796
It's the umbrella sail.


238
0:8:40,796 --> 0:8:42,86
HARRY: Wow.


239
0:8:42,86 --> 0:8:44,55
We don't have to row anymore.


240
0:8:44,55 --> 0:8:47,44
DAVID CHOE: This is awesome.


241
0:8:47,44 --> 0:8:49,286
Dude, we're fucking
moving, man.


242
0:8:49,286 --> 0:8:56,73



243
0:8:56,73 --> 0:8:59,52
My credit card company called
yesterday and said I'm late on


244
0:8:59,52 --> 0:9:2,62
all my payments, on all
my cash advances.


245
0:9:2,62 --> 0:9:4,6
It's amazing how
the tide turns.


246
0:9:4,6 --> 0:9:5,85
One day you have no money.


247
0:9:5,85 --> 0:9:9,12
Next day you win a couple grand
in Tunica, Mississippi.


248
0:9:9,12 --> 0:9:11,18
Next day, you're on a boat.


249
0:9:11,18 --> 0:9:13,91
The credit card company can
eat my ass right now.


250
0:9:13,91 --> 0:9:16,822
There's really no where else
I'd rather be right now.


251
0:9:16,822 --> 0:9:18,73
I'm fucking sailing down
the Mississippi River.


252
0:9:18,73 --> 0:9:20,2
I wish--


253
0:9:20,2 --> 0:9:25,94
the only other thing that I
would like is if I was-- whoa!


254
0:9:25,94 --> 0:9:26,96
HARRY (OFFSCREEN): If
you're on board.


255
0:9:26,96 --> 0:9:29,95
DAVID CHOE: Is if I was lying
on my back like this, and my


256
0:9:29,95 --> 0:9:30,46
girlfriend was sitting
on my face.


257
0:9:30,46 --> 0:9:33,524
And I'm holding the umbrella
sail like this.


258
0:9:33,524 --> 0:9:35,0
HARRY: That would be amazing.


259
0:9:35,0 --> 0:9:36,64
DAVID CHOE: But, really there's
no where else I'd


260
0:9:36,64 --> 0:9:37,89
rather be right now.


261
0:9:37,89 --> 0:9:47,82



262
0:9:47,82 --> 0:9:49,351
HARRY: Bon voyage.


263
0:9:49,351 --> 0:9:50,64
I'm going to brave
the sinkholes.


264
0:9:50,64 --> 0:9:55,633



265
0:9:55,633 --> 0:9:57,123
DAVID CHOE: Can you
touch the bottom?


266
0:9:57,123 --> 0:9:57,91
HARRY: No.


267
0:9:57,91 --> 0:9:59,658
DAVID CHOE: Can you
see any catfish?


268
0:9:59,658 --> 0:10:1,33
HARRY: I don't feel any.


269
0:10:1,33 --> 0:10:3,87
DAVID CHOE: Can you see any?


270
0:10:3,87 --> 0:10:5,62
HARRY: Can't see shit,
it's all brown.


271
0:10:5,62 --> 0:10:8,633
DAVID CHOE: Are there any black
mermaids down there?


272
0:10:8,633 --> 0:10:10,112
HARRY: I think.


273
0:10:10,112 --> 0:11:0,986



274
0:11:0,986 --> 0:11:3,28
DAVID CHOE: We changed
our mind.


275
0:11:3,28 --> 0:11:4,83
We're having too much
of a good time.


276
0:11:4,83 --> 0:11:6,24
Fuck camping out.


277
0:11:6,24 --> 0:11:8,8
Let's fucking keep this
adventure going.


278
0:11:8,8 --> 0:11:9,65
We're going to stay on
the river all night.


279
0:11:9,65 --> 0:11:10,45
See how far we get.


280
0:11:10,45 --> 0:11:11,79
We went 20 miles today.


281
0:11:11,79 --> 0:11:15,6
Probably get 30, 40, maybe even
50 miles by tomorrow.


282
0:11:15,6 --> 0:11:18,1
Only thing is, we're stuck in
like some kind of weird


283
0:11:18,1 --> 0:11:19,38
current in the middle
of the river.


284
0:11:19,38 --> 0:11:25,308



285
0:11:25,308 --> 0:11:28,5
HARRY (OFFSCREEN): Guess they
don't want to stop for us.


286
0:11:28,5 --> 0:11:29,955
DAVID CHOE: Let's give
them a honker.


287
0:11:29,955 --> 0:11:31,216
HARRY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, let
them know what's up.


288
0:11:31,216 --> 0:11:35,775
[HONK]


289
0:11:35,775 --> 0:11:37,36
DAVID CHOE: Yeah, we're OK.


290
0:11:37,36 --> 0:11:38,61
How far are you guys headed?


291
0:11:38,61 --> 0:11:40,81



292
0:11:40,81 --> 0:11:41,86
How far are you guys headed?


293
0:11:41,86 --> 0:11:43,7
SPEAKER 1: We're getting
ready to go fishing.


294
0:11:43,7 --> 0:11:45,1
DAVID CHOE: Can you
give us a lift?


295
0:11:45,1 --> 0:11:45,87
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, man.


296
0:11:45,87 --> 0:11:47,12
DAVID CHOE: All right.


297
0:11:47,12 --> 0:11:50,15



298
0:11:50,15 --> 0:11:50,78
All right.


299
0:11:50,78 --> 0:11:52,28
SPEAKER 1: OK.


300
0:11:52,28 --> 0:11:53,28
DAVID CHOE: What's your name?


301
0:11:53,28 --> 0:11:54,78
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE].


302
0:11:54,78 --> 0:11:55,59
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
Dave and Harry.


303
0:11:55,59 --> 0:11:56,99
SPEAKER 1: Dave and who?


304
0:11:56,99 --> 0:11:57,74
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Harry.


305
0:11:57,74 --> 0:11:58,55
SPEAKER 1: Harry?


306
0:11:58,55 --> 0:11:58,686
HARRY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.


307
0:11:58,686 --> 0:12:0,182
SPEAKER 1: Nice to meet y'all.


308
0:12:0,182 --> 0:12:0,987
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Nice
to meet you guys, too.


309
0:12:0,987 --> 0:12:2,527
What do you guys do
during the week?


310
0:12:2,527 --> 0:12:3,489
SPEAKER 1: Work.


311
0:12:3,489 --> 0:12:4,451
DAVID CHOE: Yeah?


312
0:12:4,451 --> 0:12:4,932
Where?


313
0:12:4,932 --> 0:12:6,375
SPEAKER 1: I drive a truck.


314
0:12:6,375 --> 0:12:6,856
[INAUDIBLE].


315
0:12:6,856 --> 0:12:8,78
DAVID CHOE: You ever pick
up hitch-hikers?


316
0:12:8,78 --> 0:12:11,262
SPEAKER 1: You know, I haven't
seen no hitch-hikers no more.


317
0:12:11,262 --> 0:12:12,204
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
That's true.


318
0:12:12,204 --> 0:12:13,146
Why do you think that is?


319
0:12:13,146 --> 0:12:14,88
SPEAKER 1: You see?


320
0:12:14,88 --> 0:12:15,501
On the interstate border?


321
0:12:15,501 --> 0:12:16,443
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Right.


322
0:12:16,443 --> 0:12:19,446
SPEAKER 1: A guy picked
up girls up there.


323
0:12:19,446 --> 0:12:20,432
He was killed.


324
0:12:20,432 --> 0:12:21,418
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, OK.


325
0:12:21,418 --> 0:12:22,897
SPEAKER 1: Fucking heard
it on the news.


326
0:12:22,897 --> 0:12:23,883
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
That was you?


327
0:12:23,883 --> 0:12:25,855
SPEAKER 1: Hell no.


328
0:12:25,855 --> 0:12:27,827
They killed him.


329
0:12:27,827 --> 0:12:30,292
He was killed and thrown
in the Arkansas River.


330
0:12:30,292 --> 0:12:33,52
HARRY (OFFSCREEN): Damn.


331
0:12:33,52 --> 0:12:36,914
DAVID CHOE: It really, really
doesn't get better than this.


332
0:12:36,914 --> 0:12:39,626



333
0:12:39,626 --> 0:12:43,37
Who says you can't get picked
up by truckers?


334
0:12:43,37 --> 0:12:44,64
These are our friends
from Arkansas.


335
0:12:44,64 --> 0:12:45,63
They just gave us--


336
0:12:45,63 --> 0:12:48,57
truckers that gave us our first
lift on a boat, and


337
0:12:48,57 --> 0:12:50,6
hooked us up with some beer.


338
0:12:50,6 --> 0:12:51,83
Thank you, gentlemen.


339
0:12:51,83 --> 0:12:52,62
Have a good time fishing.


340
0:12:52,62 --> 0:12:54,77
Have a good weekend.


341
0:12:54,77 --> 0:12:55,45
Take care.


342
0:12:55,45 --> 0:12:56,851
Awesome ride, thank you guys.


343
0:12:56,851 --> 0:12:59,186
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.


344
0:12:59,186 --> 0:13:0,366
DAVID CHOE: Wow.


345
0:13:0,366 --> 0:13:2,768
It really doesn't get
better than that.


346
0:13:2,768 --> 0:13:7,36
All right, I'm fucking in my
boxers, lying on a raft,


347
0:13:7,36 --> 0:13:9,42
drinking beers and booze with
my friend Harry, and they're


348
0:13:9,42 --> 0:13:10,95
fucking cold.


349
0:13:10,95 --> 0:13:10,86
HARRY: Yeah.


350
0:13:10,86 --> 0:13:12,34
DAVID CHOE: Harry, can
I ask you a question?


351
0:13:12,34 --> 0:13:12,8
HARRY: What?


352
0:13:12,8 --> 0:13:14,45
DAVID CHOE: Why is
life so rad?


353
0:13:14,45 --> 0:13:15,7
HARRY: It is.


354
0:13:15,7 --> 0:13:16,9
It just is.


355
0:13:16,9 --> 0:13:17,19
And we're down in the river.


356
0:13:17,19 --> 0:13:20,53
DAVID CHOE: They brought us at
least 8 miles down the river.


357
0:13:20,53 --> 0:13:23,6
New Orleans is at least 400
miles still away, so that'll


358
0:13:23,6 --> 0:13:25,73
probably take us two weeks to
get to, but as long as we get


359
0:13:25,73 --> 0:13:29,55
about 8 more miles to a town
called Eudora, Arkansas.


360
0:13:29,55 --> 0:13:33,13
We can get to service road from
there and hitch on down


361
0:13:33,13 --> 0:13:34,38
to New Orleans.


362
0:13:34,38 --> 0:13:42,56



363
0:13:42,56 --> 0:13:45,64
I don't know how the light looks
to you guys, but the


364
0:13:45,64 --> 0:13:48,28
sun's going down, and it's gonna
be pitch-black in about


365
0:13:48,28 --> 0:13:49,41
30 minutes.


366
0:13:49,41 --> 0:13:52,11
And it is gonna be super
dangerous out here.


367
0:13:52,11 --> 0:14:5,75



368
0:14:5,75 --> 0:14:6,95
Pitch black.


369
0:14:6,95 --> 0:14:10,0
2:00 in the morning, floating
down the Mississippi River.


370
0:14:10,0 --> 0:14:12,63
I mean this is shit that
film or video will


371
0:14:12,63 --> 0:14:14,13
never be able to capture.


372
0:14:14,13 --> 0:14:16,7
One of these big barges come by,
and every time they go by,


373
0:14:16,7 --> 0:14:19,731
it makes little wakes that makes
your boat feel like it's


374
0:14:19,731 --> 0:14:21,4
going to flip over.


375
0:14:21,4 --> 0:14:26,245
I mean, it's unbelievable.


376
0:14:26,245 --> 0:14:28,44
It's just me and Harry drifting
down this river at


377
0:14:28,44 --> 0:14:30,46
two miles an hour.


378
0:14:30,46 --> 0:14:32,64
All you hear is grasshoppers,
and locusts, and


379
0:14:32,64 --> 0:14:35,61
cicadas, and dogs and--


380
0:14:35,61 --> 0:14:38,154
see every fucking star.


381
0:14:38,154 --> 0:14:39,404
It's beautiful.


382
0:14:39,404 --> 0:14:44,62



383
0:14:44,62 --> 0:14:47,48
We just docked our
boat right there.


384
0:14:47,48 --> 0:14:50,25
It's about 2:00 in
the morning.


385
0:14:50,25 --> 0:14:54,36
We got scared when our boat
started poking into the sticks


386
0:14:54,36 --> 0:14:56,74
coming out of the ground, so
we're going to camp out here


387
0:14:56,74 --> 0:14:58,42
for the night.


388
0:14:58,42 --> 0:14:59,73
It's good a place as any.


389
0:14:59,73 --> 0:15:2,35



390
0:15:2,35 --> 0:15:3,76
We got two bonfires going.


391
0:15:3,76 --> 0:15:7,3
We got this old tree that fell
down, and we're lighting the


392
0:15:7,3 --> 0:15:8,95
entire stump on fire.


393
0:15:8,95 --> 0:15:11,86
The smell of burning
embers in the air.


394
0:15:11,86 --> 0:15:13,72
We got the little baby
one started.


395
0:15:13,72 --> 0:15:14,71
I cut off my shirt.


396
0:15:14,71 --> 0:15:16,73
I'm starting to look like
the Incredible Hulk.


397
0:15:16,73 --> 0:15:20,87
As day 13 arrives, Sunday, I
really had my heart on going


398
0:15:20,87 --> 0:15:26,45
to church tomorrow, but this
might be better than church at


399
0:15:26,45 --> 0:15:27,7
getting in touch with God.


400
0:15:27,7 --> 0:15:30,907



401
0:15:30,907 --> 0:15:34,28
I hope with my fried brain, I'm
able to remember nights


402
0:15:34,28 --> 0:15:36,885
like this because this is one of
the best nights of my life.


403
0:15:36,885 --> 0:15:43,83



404
0:15:43,83 --> 0:15:45,9
Rise and shine, America.


405
0:15:45,9 --> 0:15:49,3
We're at day 13 at Thumbs
Up, America.


406
0:15:49,3 --> 0:15:51,625



407
0:15:51,625 --> 0:15:53,13
The light's starting
to come up.


408
0:15:53,13 --> 0:15:58,94
I'm guessing it's 4:00,
5:00 in the morning.


409
0:15:58,94 --> 0:16:1,88
The sun has not yet risen
over the Mississippi.


410
0:16:1,88 --> 0:16:6,65
I have swamp butt, mud butt.


411
0:16:6,65 --> 0:16:11,77
My face is swollen from
the morning frost.


412
0:16:11,77 --> 0:16:13,78
Spider bites, horse
flies, mosquitoes.


413
0:16:13,78 --> 0:16:16,66



414
0:16:16,66 --> 0:16:17,91
I can't even feel my face.


415
0:16:17,91 --> 0:16:22,29
It feels worse than when we
slept at the golf course.


416
0:16:22,29 --> 0:16:24,31
It got a lot colder
than we thought.


417
0:16:24,31 --> 0:16:27,7
But, I'll tell you what,
I couldn't be happier.


418
0:16:27,7 --> 0:16:30,13
Anyway, the sun's coming up.


419
0:16:30,13 --> 0:16:33,28
We want to head a little deeper
into Louisiana before


420
0:16:33,28 --> 0:16:35,43
we hit the streets.


421
0:16:35,43 --> 0:16:36,68
So, wish us luck, America.


422
0:16:36,68 --> 0:17:2,74



423
0:17:2,74 --> 0:17:7,47
I think if my calculations are
correct, we're either at the


424
0:17:7,47 --> 0:17:10,91
very tip of Arkansas, or at
least at the tip of Louisiana.


425
0:17:10,91 --> 0:17:13,3
That'd be awesome if we made it
all the way to Louisiana.


426
0:17:13,3 --> 0:17:18,26



427
0:17:18,26 --> 0:17:19,76
Looks like we made it.


428
0:17:19,76 --> 0:17:21,725
Lake Providence, Louisiana.


429
0:17:21,725 --> 0:17:25,52
Of all the places we could end
up, we end up in the Private


430
0:17:25,52 --> 0:17:26,695
Resort Hunting Club.


431
0:17:26,695 --> 0:17:29,896
They shoot on sight.


432
0:17:29,896 --> 0:17:30,5
HARRY: No trespassers.


433
0:17:30,5 --> 0:17:36,9
DAVID CHOE: We got here in the
daytime instead of night.


434
0:17:36,9 --> 0:17:37,34
So we're lucky.


435
0:17:37,34 --> 0:17:49,22



436
0:17:49,22 --> 0:17:50,47
DAVID CHOE: And they
all have guns.


437
0:17:50,47 --> 0:18:3,399



438
0:18:3,399 --> 0:18:6,1
DAVID CHOE: We're in Louisiana
in the south.


439
0:18:6,1 --> 0:18:10,846
Catching a ride from a private
hunting club to the main road.


440
0:18:10,846 --> 0:18:12,1
Just got off the river.


441
0:18:12,1 --> 0:18:15,45
I see cotton fields and I see
a noose hanging by a tree.


442
0:18:15,45 --> 0:18:20,17



443
0:18:20,17 --> 0:18:21,42
What do you think about that?


444
0:18:21,42 --> 0:18:33,818



445
0:18:33,818 --> 0:18:35,55
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
I know I've been


446
0:18:35,55 --> 0:18:36,22
constipated for a few days.


447
0:18:36,22 --> 0:18:38,5
If I saw that, I would've
went [POOP NOISE].


448
0:18:38,5 --> 0:18:39,6
That is--


449
0:18:39,6 --> 0:18:40,65
I'm scared just sitting
here right now.


450
0:18:40,65 --> 0:18:48,272



451
0:18:48,272 --> 0:18:49,58
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
I'm laughing


452
0:18:49,58 --> 0:18:50,83
but I'm crying inside.


453
0:18:50,83 --> 0:18:54,66



454
0:18:54,66 --> 0:18:56,186
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, my god.


455
0:18:56,186 --> 0:18:58,13
SPEAKER 2: Well, how
is hitch-hiking


456
0:18:58,13 --> 0:19:0,15
these days and times?


457
0:19:0,15 --> 0:19:0,81
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
Well, have you


458
0:19:0,81 --> 0:19:1,395
ever hitch-hiked before?


459
0:19:1,395 --> 0:19:1,87
SPEAKER 2: I used to.


460
0:19:1,87 --> 0:19:4,59
I've hitch-hiked very little,
but I used to pick up


461
0:19:4,59 --> 0:19:7,195
hitch-hikers back in the
early '80s, but I don't


462
0:19:7,195 --> 0:19:7,45
pick them up any more.


463
0:19:7,45 --> 0:19:9,605
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): And
your reason for that is?


464
0:19:9,605 --> 0:19:11,15
SPEAKER 2: Frickin'
nuts out there.


465
0:19:11,15 --> 0:19:13,34
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): But what
happened in the '80s and


466
0:19:13,34 --> 0:19:15,59
'90s until now that--


467
0:19:15,59 --> 0:19:17,45
the world has just transformed
into a bunch


468
0:19:17,45 --> 0:19:18,82
of nut jobs or something?


469
0:19:18,82 --> 0:19:21,66
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, some of them.


470
0:19:21,66 --> 0:19:23,33
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): I
mean, I don't think the


471
0:19:23,33 --> 0:19:24,9
quotient of nut jobs
have changed.


472
0:19:24,9 --> 0:19:26,44
I think the media has
changed, you know?


473
0:19:26,44 --> 0:19:27,2
SPEAKER 2: I don't know.


474
0:19:27,2 --> 0:19:30,145
As you get older and you get a
family, you get more scared


475
0:19:30,145 --> 0:19:30,69
about people.


476
0:19:30,69 --> 0:19:32,142
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
That's true.


477
0:19:32,142 --> 0:19:33,79
SPEAKER 2: Y'all will have
something to talk about when


478
0:19:33,79 --> 0:19:34,735
you get older.


479
0:19:34,735 --> 0:19:35,705
[INAUDIBLE]


480
0:19:35,705 --> 0:19:36,955
I think it's pretty cool.


481
0:19:36,955 --> 0:19:45,405



482
0:19:45,405 --> 0:19:48,8



483
0:19:48,8 --> 0:19:49,36
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.


484
0:19:49,36 --> 0:19:50,61
I appreciate the ride.


485
0:19:50,61 --> 0:19:56,302



486
0:19:56,302 --> 0:20:0,39
DAVID CHOE: We gotta
get a recap.


487
0:20:0,39 --> 0:20:1,762
Get into it.


488
0:20:1,762 --> 0:20:3,9
Get off the river.


489
0:20:3,9 --> 0:20:7,96
That last family in town, they
didn't leave for hunting for


490
0:20:7,96 --> 0:20:9,17
the day for whatever reason.


491
0:20:9,17 --> 0:20:12,675
Get lucky, they gave us
15 miles into town.


492
0:20:12,675 --> 0:20:16,74
I mean, ha-ha-ha, funny, it's
like what the fuck, dude.


493
0:20:16,74 --> 0:20:19,75
Two Chinamen just rolled in on
a raft into your backyard.


494
0:20:19,75 --> 0:20:21,987
And we gave them the raft.


495
0:20:21,987 --> 0:20:24,729
About to get two
cheeseburgers.


496
0:20:24,729 --> 0:20:25,56
Tired as fuck.


497
0:20:25,56 --> 0:20:27,96
Dehydrated as fuck.


498
0:20:27,96 --> 0:20:27,83
I'm gonna faint.


499
0:20:27,83 --> 0:20:30,25
I'm gonna eat like six of these
fruit smoothie, cream


500
0:20:30,25 --> 0:20:31,78
slush, shakes and malts.


501
0:20:31,78 --> 0:20:35,416



502
0:20:35,416 --> 0:20:39,17
We're in Louisiana, so gonna
hit New Orleans.


503
0:20:39,17 --> 0:20:40,18
Should be there by tonight.


504
0:20:40,18 --> 0:20:41,59
We're gonna hitch out
of town right now.


505
0:20:41,59 --> 0:22:41,59
