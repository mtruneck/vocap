CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: I`m Carl Azuz. It is
October, 31st and this is CNN STUDENT NEWS.


2
0:0:5,99 --> 0:0:10,269
No tricks, but we will treat you to ten minutes
of commercial free headlines. It all starts


3
0:0:10,269 --> 0:0:30,0
right now.


4
0:0:30,0 --> 0:0:35,48
Catastrophic, historic, unthinkable -- those
are some of the words being used to describe


5
0:0:35,48 --> 0:0:40,149
the impact of the storm named Sandy that hit
the U.S. on Monday. Now, when that happened,


6
0:0:40,149 --> 0:0:46,449
when it made landfall, it wasn`t a hurricane,
it was technically a post tropical storm,


7
0:0:46,449 --> 0:0:51,16
because its energy was coming from a different
source. Whatever you want to call it, Sandy


8
0:0:51,16 --> 0:0:56,739
was very, very dangerous. Flooding brought
on by Sandy`s wind and rain and the storm


9
0:0:56,739 --> 0:1:1,79
surge, the waves that were created along the
coast. Some towns in New Jersey were under


10
0:1:1,79 --> 0:1:8,25
four or five feet of water. Floodwaters rushed
into New York City subway tunnels as well.


11
0:1:8,25 --> 0:1:15,77
Sandy is being blamed for at least 30 deaths
across the U.S. And this -- that`s a power


12
0:1:15,77 --> 0:1:21,36
transformer that blew in New York. Nearly
8 million people lost power because of Sandy,


13
0:1:21,36 --> 0:1:29,39
and some officials said it could be out for
days.


14
0:1:29,39 --> 0:1:35,13
That kind of gives you an idea about how strong
Sandy`s winds were. And so does this -- the


15
0:1:35,13 --> 0:1:40,17
smoke you are seeing there, the front of the
building just collapsed, apparently from the


16
0:1:40,17 --> 0:1:44,93
wind. You might wonder how wind can be that
strong. It could have something to do with


17
0:1:44,93 --> 0:1:48,79
where this thing hit. Tom Foreman breaks down
the science.


18
0:1:48,79 --> 0:1:48,67
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


19
0:1:48,67 --> 0:1:52,63
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As the winds
of Hurricane Sandy have spread out over hundreds


20
0:1:52,63 --> 0:1:58,67
of miles, the estimate of how much damage
they can do has also grown to $7 billion.


21
0:1:58,67 --> 0:2:3,49
How is that possible from wind alone? Well,
we`ve sliced up Hurricane Erin (ph) here into


22
0:2:3,49 --> 0:2:6,42
layers to show you what -- look at the bottom
down there. You see all that red -- that`s


23
0:2:6,42 --> 0:2:11,97
where the wind is the most intense. As you
move up in the storm, it becomes less intense


24
0:2:11,97 --> 0:2:16,9
once you get several miles in the air, but
all of the tallest buildings on the East Coast


25
0:2:16,9 --> 0:2:22,55
fit right down in that red zone, and in a
strange way, they actually make the storm


26
0:2:22,55 --> 0:2:24,67
more ferocious for the people who are living
there.


27
0:2:24,67 --> 0:2:28,96
Let me show you why. If you have an air flow
passing over an empty field or perhaps low


28
0:2:28,96 --> 0:2:33,51
buildings, it can do so largely unimpeded.
But once you introduce something like New


29
0:2:33,51 --> 0:2:38,86
York City to the equation here, you change
everything, because now the air has to speed


30
0:2:38,86 --> 0:2:45,15
up to get around all those buildings and maintain
its air flow to go over those buildings, and


31
0:2:45,15 --> 0:2:50,26
that magnifies three things that are very
dangerous about hurricane winds. First of


32
0:2:50,26 --> 0:2:55,16
all, it makes them more explosive. In aerospace
terms, whenever an airflow hit`s a square


33
0:2:55,16 --> 0:3:1,36
or rectangular object, it creates what`s called
turbulent flow. In simple layman`s terms,


34
0:3:1,36 --> 0:3:6,2
that means the air becomes all roiled up and
it starts pounding against itself and against


35
0:3:6,2 --> 0:3:8,48
other objects, and it simply becomes more
violent.


36
0:3:8,48 --> 0:3:13,1
Secondly, in hurricanes, you are always talking
about sustained winds, winds that will continue


37
0:3:13,1 --> 0:3:18,84
not for a few minutes, but for hour after
hour, grinding away, looking for weak spots


38
0:3:18,84 --> 0:3:24,21
around doors or windows or the cornices of
roofs. And thirdly, you are talking about


39
0:3:24,21 --> 0:3:28,8
directional wind. That means it`s always going
to be attacking from the same direction. So


40
0:3:28,8 --> 0:3:33,69
if it finds that weak spot, it`s going to
exploit it, because it just keeps yanking


41
0:3:33,69 --> 0:3:39,13
away at it without letting up. All of that
comes together in this terrible witch`s brew


42
0:3:39,13 --> 0:3:42,61
for the cities of the East Coast in the winds
of Sandy.


43
0:3:42,61 --> 0:3:43,31
(END VIDEOTAPE)


44
0:3:43,31 --> 0:3:47,54
AZUZ: With storms like Sandy, you expect strong
winds and heavy rain, but the different effects


45
0:3:47,54 --> 0:3:53,7
of this storm are almost unbelievable. Water.
We mentioned flooding in New York subway.


46
0:3:53,7 --> 0:3:57,45
This is what it looked like. And those water
levels won`t go down on their own. That water


47
0:3:57,45 --> 0:3:59,58
is going to have to be pumped out.


48
0:3:59,58 --> 0:4:4,47
Fire. This one broke out in a neighborhood
in New York. Sandy`s winds helped it spread.


49
0:4:4,47 --> 0:4:7,57
At least 80 homes were destroyed by the flames.


50
0:4:7,57 --> 0:4:13,3
Snow. Sandy spawned a blizzard in West Virginia.
Parts of Maryland and North Carolina were


51
0:4:13,3 --> 0:4:18,38
hit with heavy snow as well. This is what
part of the Jersey shore looked like yesterday.


52
0:4:18,38 --> 0:4:23,99
Rows of houses damaged or destroyed by the
storm. And along flooded roads, rescue crews


53
0:4:23,99 --> 0:4:29,43
are out in boats and trucks. Some people had
to wait on their roof for rescuers to arrive.


54
0:4:29,43 --> 0:4:33,65
Relief organizations are working to get help
to the victims of this storm. You can help


55
0:4:33,65 --> 0:4:39,71
them too. Go to the Spotlight section at cnnstudentnews.com
and look for the "impact your world" link

MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
I want you to be able to get a job. I know


59
0:4:47,94 --> 0:4:49,44
what it takes to get this economy going.


60
0:4:49,44 --> 0:4:51,12
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: The most important thing we can


61
0:4:51,12 --> 0:4:56,5
do is to make sure that we are creating job
in this country, but not just jobs, good paying


62
0:4:56,5 --> 0:4:57,32
jobs.


63
0:4:57,32 --> 0:4:59,8
(END VIDEO CLIP)


64
0:4:59,8 --> 0:5:4,63
AZUZ: You`ve heard Governor Romney and President
Obama talk a lot about the economy in this


65
0:5:4,63 --> 0:5:8,97
presidential campaign. There is a good reason
for that. For many voters, it is the most


66
0:5:8,97 --> 0:5:13,22
important issue in the election. It`s also
what we are looking at today as we continue


67
0:5:13,22 --> 0:5:15,98
our series on the candidates positions.


68
0:5:15,98 --> 0:5:20,44
Part of Governor Romney`s plan is to cut taxes
for all Americans. He would also lower the


69
0:5:20,44 --> 0:5:25,22
tax rate for businesses. The governor`s campaign
site says that cutting taxes will help the


70
0:5:25,22 --> 0:5:30,14
economy grow. For example, companies will
have more money to hire workers. Romney`s


71
0:5:30,14 --> 0:5:35,77
also talked about making the federal government
smaller in order to reduce government spending.


72
0:5:35,77 --> 0:5:40,61
President Obama also wants to lower the tax
rate for businesses. For most individual Americans,


73
0:5:40,61 --> 0:5:44,93
he said that he wants to keep the tax rate
where it is. But he wants to raise taxes on


74
0:5:44,93 --> 0:5:49,42
wealthy Americans in order to help generate
more revenue for the federal government. The


75
0:5:49,42 --> 0:5:54,38
president also wants to create incentives,
rewards for companies that bring jobs back


76
0:5:54,38 --> 0:5:55,8
to America.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mr. Butler`s social studies classes


79
0:6:1,33 --> 0:6:9,11
at Atlantis Academy in Coral Springs, Florida.
Ichiro Suzuki, Hideki Matsui and Yu Darvish


80
0:6:9,11 --> 0:6:16,639
are known for playing what sport? Here we
go, it is basketball, badminton, billiards


81
0:6:16,639 --> 0:6:23,7
or baseball? You`ve got three seconds, go!


82
0:6:23,7 --> 0:6:30,16
They are all Major League Baseball players
who were born in Japan. That`s your answer,


83
0:6:30,16 --> 0:6:32,22
and that`s your "Shoutout."


84
0:6:32,22 --> 0:6:33,76
(END VIDEO CLIP)


85
0:6:33,76 --> 0:6:38,77
AZUZ: All right, so in the majors they are
probably used to playing in front of sell-out


86
0:6:38,77 --> 0:6:43,85
crowds or near cell out crowds, but back in
their home country, some Japanese teams are


87
0:6:43,85 --> 0:6:48,48
struggling with half empty stadiums. So how
do you get people to come out and fill the


88
0:6:48,48 --> 0:6:53,49
seats and to root, root, root for the home
team? Well, the Yokohama Bay Stars have some


89
0:6:53,49 --> 0:6:57,669
unique ideas. Alex Zolbert steps up to the
plate with details.


90
0:6:57,669 --> 0:6:59,6
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


91
0:6:59,6 --> 0:7:9,639
ALEX ZOLBERT, CNN ANCHOR: It is arguably Japan`s
most popular sport, a national pastime. And


92
0:7:9,639 --> 0:7:15,68
this is the league`s least successful team
this year. In fact, the Bay Stars, who hail


93
0:7:15,68 --> 0:7:21,48
from Yokohama just south of Tokyo, have sat
in the league`s basement for the past four


94
0:7:21,48 --> 0:7:28,55
years. Which helps explain all the empty seats
at one of their final home games this season.


95
0:7:28,55 --> 0:7:33,18
But the team has been testing some clever
ideas to try to change that. But in the tough


96
0:7:33,18 --> 0:7:39,169
Japanese economy, how about discounts for
fans who are trying to pay off their mortgage?


97
0:7:39,169 --> 0:7:44,63
Or offering refunds if you weren`t satisfied
with the team`s performance? A few fans lined


98
0:7:44,63 --> 0:7:49,9
up after a game even though the Bay Starts
won. Some of the gimmicks are the idea of


99
0:7:49,9 --> 0:7:56,57
team president, June Ikeida (ph), a 36-year
old with a background in advertising and marketing.


100
0:7:56,57 --> 0:8:1,73
He tells me, it`s all in effort to entice
folks who aren`t die hard baseball fans. How


101
0:8:1,73 --> 0:8:4,18
about a side show of pro-wrestling?


102
0:8:4,18 --> 0:8:9,4
This stadium holds about 30,000 people. The
average attendance this year was just over


103
0:8:9,4 --> 0:8:14,46
half of that. And while the boss recognizes
the gimmicks might help, what will help the


104
0:8:14,46 --> 0:8:17,25
most is to win more games.


105
0:8:17,25 --> 0:8:19,25
Alex Zolbert, CNN, Yokohama, Japan.

0:8:19,25 --> 0:8:20,25
(END VIDEOTAPE)


107
0:8:20,25 --> 0:8:25,37
AZUZ: Well, next stop today, we have a story
about Chy Johnson. She is a sophomore at Quinn


108
0:8:25,37 --> 0:8:30,52
Creek High in Arizona. She was born with a
brain disorder, and she said she was bullied


109
0:8:30,52 --> 0:8:36,14
because of that. One day, Chy`s mother emailed
a family friend to ask for help. That friend


110
0:8:36,14 --> 0:8:41,7
was Carson Jones. He`s the starting quarterback
in the school`s undefeated football team.


111
0:8:41,7 --> 0:8:45,74
Carson heard what was happening and decided
to tackle the bullying head on. Now from the


112
0:8:45,74 --> 0:8:50,23
first bell to the last one, Carson and some
of his team mates hang out with Chy. They


113
0:8:50,23 --> 0:8:53,79
keep an eye on her, they make sure she is
not getting bullied. One of the players says,


114
0:8:53,79 --> 0:8:58,14
it feels good to know that they can help make
someone else`s high school experience a positive


115
0:8:58,14 --> 0:8:59,94
one. Great stuff.


116
0:8:59,94 --> 0:9:5,46
Finally today, we are checking out some of
your I Report pumpkin projects. Bats on Halloween?


117
0:9:5,46 --> 0:9:10,83
Sure. Bat-man? Well, he can symbolize a dark
knight. How about this ghoul climbing out


118
0:9:10,83 --> 0:9:15,96
of the grave? Scary enough to make anyone
bury his head under a blanket? Old-time truck,


119
0:9:15,96 --> 0:9:20,58
piles of pumpkins, perfect symbol of the season,
but hey, let`s bail on that, so we can check


120
0:9:20,58 --> 0:9:26,63
out these class`s pet project. Seriously,
it`s their pet. That`s the tooth. And Becca


121
0:9:26,63 --> 0:9:33,24
(ph) High gets special prays because they
love carving pumpkins. And we love that they


122
0:9:33,24 --> 0:9:34,52
do.


123
0:9:34,52 --> 0:9:40,2
That was awesome. Big thanks to everybody
who`s sent in I Reports. Goodness gracious,


124
0:9:40,2 --> 0:9:43,75
ghost (ph), we`re out of time for today, so
we`ll look forward to seeing you tomorrow


125
0:9:43,75 --> 0:11:43,75
