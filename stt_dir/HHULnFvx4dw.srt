CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Fridays are awesome.
First one of 2013, and CNN STUDENT NEWS is


2
0:0:4,75 --> 0:0:9,7
covering everything from international affairs
to civics to technology. Welcome. Thank you


3
0:0:9,7 --> 0:0:24,81
for watching.


4
0:0:24,81 --> 0:0:29,16
The new year hasn`t seen any new let-ups in
the fighting in Syria. The Middle Eastern


5
0:0:29,16 --> 0:0:34,55
country`s been ripped apart by a civil war.
It started in March of 2011, with the government


6
0:0:34,55 --> 0:0:39,7
of President Bashar al-Assad fighting the
rebels who want him out. Since then the war


7
0:0:39,7 --> 0:0:45,91
has ballooned. Different groups and even terrorists
have joined in. The U.N. estimates that 60,000


8
0:0:45,91 --> 0:0:50,87
Syrians have been killed. And while experts
and CNN correspondents don`t know when this


9
0:0:50,87 --> 0:0:55,97
will end, exactly, they believe it will include
the removal of Syria`s president.


10
0:0:55,97 --> 0:0:57,61
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


11
0:0:57,61 --> 0:1:3,99
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Will
rebels defeat the regime? There`s very little


12
0:1:3,99 --> 0:1:7,869
doubt that will happen, it`s not going to
be one day, which has a decisive changing


13
0:1:7,869 --> 0:1:12,78
of the flags over buildings in Damascus and
then the whole country turns 180 degrees in


14
0:1:12,78 --> 0:1:18,479
terms with government. But there have been
weeks now of consistent bad news for the regime.


15
0:1:18,479 --> 0:1:25,49
For a week, regime air bases and military
outposts have fallen daily. Rebels now focusing


16
0:1:25,49 --> 0:1:30,27
on besieging the bases from where the regime
projects its brutal force.


17
0:1:30,27 --> 0:1:35,84
Now it affects not only how people feel inside
the regime in the circle, it affects how their


18
0:1:35,84 --> 0:1:41,429
sponsors feel, and, of course, it boosts morale
for the rebels as well, so that real sense


19
0:1:41,429 --> 0:1:45,999
of momentum that`s been in place now for months,
is beginning to meet (ph) around the capital,


20
0:1:45,999 --> 0:1:50,49
and I don`t think any observer at this point
thinks that the Assad government really has


21
0:1:50,49 --> 0:1:55,399
a chance in terms of retaining long term power
over the country.


22
0:1:55,399 --> 0:2:3,969
As the rebels increasingly make more military
gains, the question is beginning to be asked:


23
0:2:3,969 --> 0:2:9,1
will Assad stay on fight to the end, as he
has said or will he go?


24
0:2:9,1 --> 0:2:9,97
(END VIDEOTAPE)


25
0:2:9,97 --> 0:2:14,3
AZUZ: Yesterday was the first day back-to-school
for the students of Sandy Hook Elementary


26
0:2:14,3 --> 0:2:18,26
in Newtown, Connecticut. They`ve been out
since a shooting happened at Sandy Hook in


27
0:2:18,26 --> 0:2:23,15
the mid-December. Seven miles away, in Monroe,
Connecticut, what used to be a middle school


28
0:2:23,15 --> 0:2:27,39
was converted for them. Teachers spent part
of their Christmas break decorating, putting


29
0:2:27,39 --> 0:2:32,88
in a welcome sign, paper snowflakes sent in
from around the world, the school`s pet turtle


30
0:2:32,88 --> 0:2:36,9
and familiar rugs and furniture so that the
kids would have a smoother transition to the


31
0:2:36,9 --> 0:2:41,9
new place. Counselors and police were also
there to help. The new school, Chalk Hill


32
0:2:41,9 --> 0:2:47,86
Elementary, also has more security. At least
one parent interviewed by CNN says her son


33
0:2:47,86 --> 0:2:51,95
isn`t afraid, he`s just looking forward to
seeing his friends.


34
0:2:51,95 --> 0:2:56,55
On their first day back, one of the first
items of business for congress men and women


35
0:2:56,55 --> 0:3:1,49
was to elect a new House speaker. This comes
right out of the U.S. Constitution, Article


36
0:3:1,49 --> 0:3:7,32
1, Section 2, which says "The House of Representatives
shall chuse" - note the spelling there -- "their


37
0:3:7,32 --> 0:3:8,95
Speaker and other Officers."


38
0:3:8,95 --> 0:3:13,25
The Speaker is the leader of the House. He
or she is also a second in line to the presidency


39
0:3:13,25 --> 0:3:17,7
behind the vice president. The Constitution
doesn`t specifically mention what the Speaker


40
0:3:17,7 --> 0:3:23,36
should do, but today that job includes presiding
over the House, often speaking to the media,


41
0:3:23,36 --> 0:3:28,9
communicating House priorities and representing
constituents back home. The speaker also represents


42
0:3:28,9 --> 0:3:34,75
the majority party in the House, and since
Republicans have control with 234 representatives


43
0:3:34,75 --> 0:3:40,57
to the Democrats` 201, it was certain to be
a Republican. Yesterday, they reelected John


44
0:3:40,57 --> 0:3:45,75
Boehner as House Speaker. He got 221 votes,
and that means he`ll be doing the job for


45
0:3:45,75 --> 0:3:47,15
at least the next two years.


46
0:3:47,15 --> 0:3:48,68
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


47
0:3:48,68 --> 0:3:57,7
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? The U.S.
has more tornadoes than any other country.


48
0:3:57,7 --> 0:4:4,9
Totally true. Tornadoes can form almost anywhere,
but the U.S. gets most of any nation.


49
0:4:4,9 --> 0:4:6,76
(END VIDEO CLIP)


50
0:4:6,76 --> 0:4:13,25
AZUZ: It`s not just tornadoes, the National
Severe Storms Laboratory says thunderstorms


51
0:4:13,25 --> 0:4:18,199
in general are most common in America. And
look at these stats from the National Weather


52
0:4:18,199 --> 0:4:25,53
Service: the U.S. gets about 100,000 thunderstorms
a year, 10,000 are severe storms. We get floods,


53
0:4:25,53 --> 0:4:30,37
hurricanes making landfall. It`s part of the
reason why some folks want to climate prove


54
0:4:30,37 --> 0:4:34,789
more parts of the U.S. That`s something that`s
been tried by some cities around the world


55
0:4:34,789 --> 0:4:40,33
with both the wanted success and some unwanted
side effects. It usually involves some major


56
0:4:40,33 --> 0:4:43,33
engineering work, and with that, comes major
fees.


57
0:4:43,33 --> 0:4:43,949
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


58
0:4:43,949 --> 0:4:48,55
CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: You have to
understand where we are in the world, how


59
0:4:48,55 --> 0:4:53,2
our weather is so different here in America.
First of all, we have the Rocky Mountains


60
0:4:53,2 --> 0:4:57,759
to the west, we have a Gulf of Mexico, very
warm water here. And the cold air that plunges


61
0:4:57,759 --> 0:5:1,74
to the east of the Rocky Mountains, and that`s
where a tornado threat comes from: moisture


62
0:5:1,74 --> 0:5:6,5
here, dry air here, cold air here, and that
is tornado alley. Something else we have,


63
0:5:6,5 --> 0:5:11,24
a very large Atlantic Ocean allowing those
big storms, those hurricanes to come in at


64
0:5:11,24 --> 0:5:16,6
full throttle, full speed because the water
is still very warm there. So where do we go


65
0:5:16,6 --> 0:5:20,969
from here? How do we get ready? I guess, how
do we get climate ready? If it gets warmer


66
0:5:20,969 --> 0:5:25,31
and the water does go up, if the ice melts,
and the water in the ocean gets another foot


67
0:5:25,31 --> 0:5:29,249
higher, how do we protect ourselves? Well,
the first place that`s protected itself now,


68
0:5:29,249 --> 0:5:33,21
obviously, New Orleans. They built all of
these barriers, did a very good job this year


69
0:5:33,21 --> 0:5:34,81
at protecting New Orleans.


70
0:5:34,81 --> 0:5:39,319
Now, those barriers did something else - they
blocked the water from going into New Orleans,


71
0:5:39,319 --> 0:5:43,62
but they also really increased the amount
of water that went into Plaquemines Parish.


72
0:5:43,62 --> 0:5:48,8
So you have to watch what you do, because
you just can`t put a barrier around the entire


73
0:5:48,8 --> 0:5:52,36
world and hope that you stop all the water.
I take you over her at Rotterdam, where they


74
0:5:52,36 --> 0:5:56,71
stop the water from coming down the river
with these huge, just big gates right there.


75
0:5:56,71 --> 0:6:1,189
They will close, if there`s surge coming down
from the North. And this is what will be.


76
0:6:1,189 --> 0:6:5,219
Right here. Those two gates right there will
swing together and stop the water from coming


77
0:6:5,219 --> 0:6:11,599
in. Huge projects. I mean significantly big
projects, when it comes to how much money


78
0:6:11,599 --> 0:6:13,249
this could possibly all cost.


79
0:6:13,249 --> 0:6:14,39

81
0:6:15,24 --> 0:6:20,939
AZUZ: Time for "The Shoutout!" Which of the
following objects is three dimensional? If


82
0:6:20,939 --> 0:6:28,389
you think you know it, then shout it out!
Is it a trapezoid, rhombus, cylinder or rectangle.


83
0:6:28,389 --> 0:6:33,58
You`ve got three seconds, go!


84
0:6:33,58 --> 0:6:41,729
A Cylinder representing a water bottle or
the coffee cup on your teacher`s desk is a


85
0:6:41,729 --> 0:6:45,759
3-D object. That`s your answer and that`s
your "Shoutout."


86
0:6:45,759 --> 0:6:47,379
(END VIDEO CLIP)


87
0:6:47,379 --> 0:6:52,639
AZUZ: We can print any of those two dimensional
shapes on paper at the printer at your home,


88
0:6:52,639 --> 0:6:57,21
like we did right here. You see these shapes.
New technology is making it possible to print


89
0:6:57,21 --> 0:7:3,9
out 3D objects as well. All of these things
were made using a 3D printer. Look at this.


90
0:7:3,9 --> 0:7:8,569
It uses files (ph) pictures and adds layers
of material, usually plastic to actually make


91
0:7:8,569 --> 0:7:13,669
the object. Some companies are already using
3D printers to make medical devices and architects


92
0:7:13,669 --> 0:7:18,159
are printing models of buildings in 3D. You
could check out that shoe we showed you that


93
0:7:18,159 --> 0:7:23,529
last image there. That was made on a 3D printer.
Now the technology has come down in price


94
0:7:23,529 --> 0:7:28,779
for just over a $1000, that means for their
price, you can have a 3D printer in your house.


95
0:7:28,779 --> 0:7:33,24
It will make stuff out of plastic, but some
higher end printers can make small objects


96
0:7:33,24 --> 0:7:38,99
out of metal. The architect in this video
took an idea from nature to try to print bigger


97
0:7:38,99 --> 0:7:39,59
objects - buildings.

DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I`m Dr.
Sanjay Gupta. Meet Neri Oxman, she believes


100
0:7:45,46 --> 0:7:51,83
we can one day 3D print our buildings and
she`s using the innate wisdom of nature as


101
0:7:51,83 --> 0:7:52,219
her muse.


102
0:7:52,219 --> 0:7:56,119
NERY OXMAN, DESIGNER, MIT`S MEDIA CLUB: When
you think about other systems in nature, one


103
0:7:56,119 --> 0:8:3,15
often think of the spider web. So, the spiders
are creatures of the environment that generates


104
0:8:3,15 --> 0:8:9,96
silk, they create trailing routes, they capture
their prey, they wrap their prey. So in a


105
0:8:9,96 --> 0:8:15,889
way this spider is a kind of multi-material
3D printer. The spider itself is a kind of


106
0:8:15,889 --> 0:8:20,159
printing machine, only instead of printing
plastics, it prints with silk.


107
0:8:20,159 --> 0:8:25,52
GUPTA: At a lab at MIT`s media lab, she is
experimenting with different printable materials,


108
0:8:25,52 --> 0:8:27,529
everything from concrete to silk.


109
0:8:27,529 --> 0:8:30,469
STEVEN KEATING, RESEARCH ASSISTANT, MIT MEDIA
LAB: With the system we`re hoping to be able


110
0:8:30,469 --> 0:8:36,959
to 3D print buildings with whatever geometry
we want. So imagine that Dr. Seuss looking


111
0:8:36,959 --> 0:8:42,149
curved house would cost the same amount as
a rectangular, box-shaped house.


112
0:8:42,149 --> 0:8:49,199
OXMAN: In the near future, we will be using
3D printing to print buildings, to print houses.

128
0:9:32,89 --> 0:9:37,93
never been to any Alabama bowl game, let alone
a national championship, so his surprise was


129
0:9:37,93 --> 0:9:42,41
Ala-fantastic. You don`t need to be a Bama

0:9:42,41 --> 0:9:43,339
Notre Dame


131
0:9:43,339 --> 0:11:43,339
That foots the ball for this week on CNN STUDENT
