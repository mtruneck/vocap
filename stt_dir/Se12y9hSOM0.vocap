###8 this is a story about a world obsessed with stuff
###10 it's a story about a system in crisis.
###13 we're trashing the planet
###14 we're trashing each other
###16 and we're not even having fun
###19 the good thing, is that when we start to understand the system
###22 we can see lots of places to step  in and turn these problems into solutions
###27 [music]
###34 one the problems with trying to use less stuff
###39 is that sometimes we feel like we really need it
###41 what if you live in a city like, say  cleveland, and you want a glass of water
###44 are you going to take your chances and get it from the city tap?
###48 or should you reach for a bottle of water  that comes from the pristine rainforests of
###51 Fiji?
###52 Well, Fiji brand water thought the answer to this question was obvious
###56 So they built a whole ad campaign around it
###58 it turned out to be one of the dumbest moves
###60 in advertising history
###61 the city of cleveland it like being the butt
###64 of fiji jokes
###65 so they did some tests and guess what?
###67 These tests showed a glass of Fiji water is lower quality
###70 it loses taste tests against Cleveland tap
###73 and costs thousands of times more
###76 this story is typical of what happens when
###79 you test bottled water against tap water
###80 is it cleaner?
###81 sometimes, sometimes not
###83 in many ways bottled water is less regulated
###86 than tap
###87 Is it tastier?
###88 In taste tests across the country, people consistently
###91 choose tap over bottled water.
###93 These bottled water companies say they're just meeting consumer demand
###97 but who would demand a less sustainable
###99 less tasty, way more expensive product
###102 especially one you can get almost free in your kitchen
###105 bottled water costs that two thousand times more than tap water
###109 Can you imagine paying 2000 times the price of anything else?
###112 how about a $10,000 sandwich?
###114 yet people in the US by more than half a billion
###117 gallons of water every week
###119 that is enough to circle the globe more than five times
###123 how did this come to be?
###125 well it all goes back to how our materials economy works
###128 and one of its key drivers which is known as manufactured demand
###132 if companies want to keep growing
###134 they have to keep selling more and more stuff
###136 in the 1970s giant soft drink companies
###139 got worried as they saw their growth projections
###141 starting to level off
###142 there's only so much soda that a person can drink
###144 Plus it wouldn't be long before people began
###147 realizing that soda is not that healthy
###149 and turned back to [gasp] drinking tap water.
###152 well the companies found their next big idea
###155 in a silly designer product that most people laughed off
###158 as a passing yuppie fad
###159 "Water is free," people said back then.
###161 "what will they sell us next, air?"
###164 so how do you get people to buy this fringe product?
###167 Simple. You manufacture demand
###170 How do you do that?
###171 Well, imagine you're in charge of the bottled water
###174 company
###175 Since people aren't lining up to trade their hard-earned money
###177 for you unnecessary product
###179 you make them feel scared and insecure if the don't have it
###182 and that's exactly what the bottled water industry did
###185 one of their first marketing tactics was to
###188 scare people about tap water
###189 with ads like Fiji's Cleveland campaign.
###192 ""When were done," one top water exec said,
###195 "tap water will be relegated to showers and washing dishes."
###199 Next, you hide the reality of your product behind
###202 images of pure fantasy
###204 Have you ever noticed how bottled water tries to seduce us
###207 with pictures of mountains streams and pristine nature?
###210 But guess where a third of all bottled water in the U.S. actually
###213 comes from?
###214 The tap!
###216 Pepsi's Aquafina and Coke's Dasani
###218 are two of the many brands that are really filtered tap water
###221 But the pristine nature lie goes much deeper.
###224 In a recent full page ad, Nestlé said:
###227 "Bottled water is the most environmentally
###230 responsible consumer product in the world."
###232 What?!
###233 They are trashing the environment all along the product's life cycle.
###236 ﻿﻿Exactly how is that environmentally responsible?
###240 The problems start here with extraction and production
###243 where oil is used to make water bottles
###245 Each year, making the plastic water bottles
###248 used in the U.S. takes enough oil and energy
###251 to fuel a million cars.
###253 All that energy spent to make the bottle
###255 even more to ship it around the planet
###258 and then we drink it in about 2 minutes?
###262 That brings us to the big problem at  the other end of the life cycle
###266 Disposal. What happens to all these bottles when we're done?
###269 Eighty percent end up in landfills,
###272 where they will sit for thousands of years,
###274 or in incinerators, where they are burned, releasing
###277 toxic pollution.
###278 The rest gets collected for recycling.
###280 I was curious about where the plastic bottles
###283 that I put in recycling bins go.
###284 I found out that shiploads were being sent
###287 to India.
###288 So, I went there.
###289 I'll never forget riding over a hill outside Madras
###292 where I came face to face with a mountain
###294 of plastic bottles from California.
###296 Real recycling would turn these bottles
###298 back into bottles.
###299 But that wasn't what was happening here.
###303 Instead these bottles were slated to be downcycled,
###306 which means turning them into lower quality
###308 products that would just be chucked later.
###310 The parts that couldn't be downcycled were thrown away there
###313 shipped all the way to India just to be dumped in
###316 someone else's backyard.
###318 If bottled water companies want to use mountains
###320 on their labels,
###321 it'd be more accurate to show one of these
###323 mountains of plastic waste.
###325 Scaring us, seducing us, and misleading us
###328  -- these strategies are all core parts of manufacturing demand
###333 Once they've manufactured all this demand,
###335 creating a new multibillion dollar market,
###338 they defend it by beating out the competition.
###340 But in this case,
###342 the competition is our basic human right to
###345 clean, safe drinking water.
###347 Pepsi's Vice Chairman publicly said,
###349 "The biggest enemy is tap water!"
###352 They want us to think it's dirty and bottled
###354  water is the best alternative.
###356 In many places, public water is polluted
###359 thanks to polluting industries like
###361 the plastic bottle industry!
###362 And these bottled water guys are all too happy
###365  to offer their expensive solutions
###367 which keep us hooked on their products.
###369 It's time we took back the tap.
###374 That starts with making a personal commitment
###374  to not buy or drink bottled water unless the water
###377  in your community is truly unhealthy.
###379 Yes, it takes a bit of foresight to grab a
###381 reusable bottle on the way out, but I think we can handle it
###384 Then take the next step
###386 join a campaign that's working for real solutions.
###389 Like demanding investment in clean tap water for all
###393 In the US, tap water is underfunded by $24 billion
###397 partly because people believe drinking water
###400 only comes from a bottle!
###401 Around the world, a billion people don't
###403  have access to clean water right now.
###405 Yet cities all over are spending millions of dollars to deal with all
###409  the plastic bottles we throw out.
###411 What if that money were spent improving our water  systems
###414 or better yet, preventing pollution to begin with?
###416 There are many more things we can do to solve this problem.
###420 Lobby your city officials to bring back drinking fountains
###423 Work to ban the purchase of bottled water
###425 by your school, organization or entire city
###428 This is a huge opportunity for millions of people to wake up
###432 and protect our wallets,
###433 our health
###434 and the planet.
###435 The good news is: it's already started.
###437 Bottled water sales have begun to drop while business is booming
###441 for safe refillable water bottles. Yay!
###444 Restaurants are proudly serving "tap"
###446 and people are choosing to pocket the hundred of thousands
###449 of dollars they would otherwise be wasting
###450 on bottled water
###452 Carrying bottled water is on its way to being
###454 as cool as smoking while pregnant.
###456 We know better now.
###458 The bottled water industry is getting worried
###460 because the jig is up.
###462 We are not buying into their
###463 manufactured demand anymore.
###465 We will choose our own demands,
###466 thank you very much, and we're demanding clean, safe water for all
###466 thank you very much, and we're demanding clean, safe water for all
