###15 BRAD KREMER: He did good for a long time.
###17 Because he started out--
###20 he was in skateboarding.
###21 Then he transitioned into snowboarding in the very, very
###24 early days of snowboarding.
###26 And as snowboarding progressed, he progressed.
###30 But then it got to a point to where he wasn't this full
###33 freestyle guy.
###34 But because he was so good at riding the mountain, he all of
###39 the sudden transitioned into this big mountain guy, and was
###42 up in Alaska doing lines and stuff that nobody ever
###45 expected him to do.
###46 He was amazing.
###48 It was really cool to see that transition from just hard core
###52 freestyle guy to big mountain guy, and to do both of them so
###55 well, better than almost anybody.
###58 I would definitely say he's one of the first to bring
###60 freestyle to the backcountry, to the big mountain.
###64 MIKE HATCHETT: When I first met Noah, he was definitely
###65 more focused on just freestyle, and just riding
###70 Squaw, and just ripping the pipe.
###71 But he started going out with my brother and I in the
###73 backcountry and just kind of dabbling around the steeps.
###75 He was a total natural talent.
###77 And then when we took him to Alaska, that's almost when his
###80 mind just--
###82 I think he started just seeing the possibilities
###87 of riding up there.
###90 That was the key that unlocked the door for Noah.
###92 He's just amazing to watch big mountain riding.
###94 And his ability on big mountain riding
###98 is top 10 for sure.
###101 JP WALKER: He rode Tahoe all the time.
###102 So it was just natural for him to like ride those type of
###105 conditions.
###105 And he did it sick.
###107 Because it seemed like all the other guys that were just big
###110 mountain riders kind of had a weird style, or just not as
###114 smooth, like Matt Goodwill, or Tex, or all those guys.
###120 They were sick for sure, but then it was just cool to see
###124 somebody that could do both.
###125 I remember he did, like, these one lines.
###128 I think they were called Super Spines or something.
###130 He's, like, doing frontside airs off them.
###132 And it's like the steepest thing ever.
###134 Like if you fell, you'd just be dead
###136 probably from rag dolling.
###137 MIKE HATCHETT: We did a season TB2 at Donner.
###140 And that spring, let's go to Alaska.
###144 OK, let's go.
###146 We just went up there and started riding the stuff.
###149 We weren't really thinking about it really.
###151 And Noah wasn't thinking about it either.
###153 It wasn't, like, a goal.
###153 I want to charge Super Spines one day.
###157 I had to basically almost talk him into that run when he
###160 finally did do that.
###161 Because it was just so ridiculously gnarly.
###165 But he was ready for it.
###166 And it was the perfect day to do it.
###167 NOAH SALASNEK: Yeah, I would say anything that's spined out
###170 is usually, the spines develop anything over 55 degrees.
###173 So you're on something steep if there's spines on it, and
###176 if it's powder and good conditions.
###179 I mean, there's nothing funner than that.
###180 It's a really amazing feeling.
###181 And the adrenaline you get from it is just unreal.
###184 MIKE HATCHETT: Also being goofy foot in
###186 Valdez on the spines.
###187 I know this is a little bit of a sidebar that might be kind
###190 of a twist for people to understand.
###192 A lot of the spines up there, if you're goofy foot, you're
###195 toe edging them.
###196 And the way for the sluffs run, and the way that the
###200 spines face, you're better off being a goofy foot on a lot of
###204 the lines up there.
###205 Not to say on the big open faces like what Johan was
###208 charging and Tom Burt.
###210 I'm just talking steep, technical spines that are
###212 close together.
###214 When you send a sluff down a run, you'll have to hop to the
###217 next one to send your sluff down.
###219 Goofy foot--
###220 Jeremy Jones, Noah Salasnek--
###223 who rips the spines the hardest?
###224 Those two guys.
###225 And they're goofy foots.
###226 And I think Valdez and Haynes--
###228 maybe I'm crazy by saying that.
###230 But I don't know.
###230 Ask Jeremy or Noah what they think.
###231 But that's my opinion.
###233 NOAH SALASNEK: A lot of on those spine runs, I would
###235 assess the line.
###237 I like to be able to ride from left to right.
###239 Because you deal with this sluff slides up
###241 there, they're called.
###242 And they're basically mini avalanches.
###243 And they're made from your turns, being on a steep slope.
###248 Throwing all that snow from your turns creates these
###250 little avalanches.
###251 And when I saw, like, Super Spines, for instance, it was
###253 kind of a big face.
###254 But I was able to go diagonal, knowing all my snow would go
###257 below me and I wouldn't encounter it again.
###260 So I didn't have to deal with the sluff.
###261 And you can also jump from one to the other.
###263 And I've always kind of prided myself on bunnying from one
###266 spine to the next and kind of staying on the power line and
###268 out of the channels.
###269 And maybe that's what Mike's talking about appreciates my
###272 technique on the spines.
###273 Because that's kind of my approach I guess a little bit.
###276 A lot of times we'll have to take a Polaroid from the
###278 helicopter on the way up.
###279 Because we haven't been to this mountain
###280 before or flown by it.
###281 So you get on top and you can't see
###283 over the edge, really.
###284 Even if you walk down close to the edge, it
###287 keeps rolling over.
###287 So you really rely on these Polaroids that you take on the
###290 way up to know where you're at and to find your line down.
###294 And it's really essential, in Alaska especially.
###297 -That could be a go.
###298 That could be sick.
###299 -I'm starting here.
###300 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###302 -The first one's a drop.
###304 Second one, you can poke through.
###306 First one's a mandatory little niblet.
###309 NOAH SALASNEK: Yeah, sometimes I'll go to roll over.
###310 And what you think you might be 30, 40 feet from your
###313 entrance is like 200 or 300 feet in Alaska.
###315 Because everything's so much bigger up there.
###317 You're like, hey, I'm going to do that cliff--
###319 30 footer.
###320 And you get next to it and it's like 60 or 70.
###322 Everything's way bigger than it looks up
###324 there for some reason.
###325 So it's really easy to get lost on top of the ridge or
###328 not know where your entrance is.
###330 And that could be a little confusing until you get over
###332 and you say-- into that fluid motion when you're
###335 involved in a line.
###336 But the entrance in the top 100 feet or 200
###338 feet is just blinding.
###340 It keeps rolling and rolling and rolling, especially if
###342 you're riding 55 degrees plus.
###344 So it's pretty burly.
###345 And that's the scariest thing, is being on top, out of your
###348 board before you ride down.
###351 You don't have that edge.
###352 But once I get on my board, I feel comfortable.
###354 I have my edge, dig in, and just wait for the cameras to
###357 say "roll," and then get it.
###359 And it's pretty fun, actually.
###360 
###382 JAMIE LYNN: My first trip up to Alaska was with Noah.
###385 And I look back at that as, I'm so thankful I had someone
###389 as knowledgeable and as professional and as on it as
###393 he was to show me an introduction to one of the
###399 biggest arenas of snowboarding.
###402 Especially with Mike and Dave Hatchett--
###405 they are the ultimate mountaineering guides, that
###409 can not only drop into the craziest
###411 terrain, but allow you--
###414 if something went down, be there for you and be able to
###417 assist in any kind of situation that could come up.
###423 It's a tense situation being up there-- a lot of first
###425 ascents, a lot of unstable snow conditions.
###429 And the knowledge and understanding of the mountains
###432 that Noah, in particular, showcased made me sit a little
###436 bit easier in dropping into a 55 degree slope where you
###440 couldn't even see what you were dropping into, only by
###444 looking at the Polaroid picture that you took from the
###446 helicopter on the way up.
###449 We shared a couple first ascents up in AK that--
###453 runs of a lifetime that I'll never forget.
###458 NOAH SALASNEK: I was in Alaska with Jamie one year.
###459 We had a really good trip and did some incredible lines
###462 together, too.
###462 One of my first ascents--
###464 Blind Faith.
###465 I was with Jamie Lynn.
###466 That was one of my more notable runs.
###468 And he was pretty stoked and terrified at the same time, as
###471 was I.
###472 But we got out on this thing and the guide didn't get out.
###475 The guide got in the heli and flew away.
###476 We couldn't believe it.
###477 We're like, isn't the guide supposed to get out with us?
###479 And we're on this thing together, on a cornice of all
###482 thing entrance line.
###484 But anyway, it was a pretty sick run.
###485 And he was there for that.
###487 It was cool.
###488 I enjoyed riding powder.
###490 I never thought that would have been most of my focus and
###493 my career later on, which it absolutely was.
###496 Not that I had tried to do that.
###497 It just kind of developed that way.
###498 I had an opportunity to go to Alaska.
###500 That was amazing.
###502 So I went back every year.
###503 And it's super enjoyable as a rider.
###506 It's the best thing to film.
###507 Because they're like, go ahead.
###508 Ride the mountain.
###509 We'll film you from the heli.
###510 So you just ride the whole thing.
###511 And the footage that comes out of there isn't going to be
###514 freestyle-based.
###515 It's going to be some powder.
###516 But yeah, professionally, I think
###518 freestyle's where it's at.
###519 It's always been the progression.
###521 It should be the focus, and it is in most sports.
###523 And it is in snowboarding.
###524 So I think that--
###526 I don't know if it was a career mistake of mine.
###528 But I don't think it certainly helped to focus strictly on
###531 powder as much as I did, and big mountain riding.
###533 I should have done a little bit more of both, and, of
###536 course, stayed in freestyle for longer.
###538 I think I would have had a longer career had I done that,
###541 potentially.
###542 So it's interesting to say.
###543 Because big mountain riding's pretty gnarly, putting your
###545 life on the line for first ascents.
###548 But a lot of people don't ride that kind of
###549 stuff and can't relate.
###550 They can relate to the parks and the pipes.
###552 And that's the stuff they want to see.
###553 And I understand that.
###555 And so it's unfortunately not as marketable.
###558 That's how it is.
###559 JP WALKER: I mean, I didn't really see it like that.
###561 I just kind of figured he just got sick of doing it.
###565 Because back then it seemed like the average time spent
###570 for a top pro was--
###572 like if you had like five video parts, you had a lot of
###575 video parts under your belt.
###577 So he'd already had, like, a bunch of parts.
###580 And I just figured he was on to other things or something.
###583 NOAH SALASNEK: You know, I never aspire to say or set
###586 goals for myself, like most people probably do
###588 and should, I believe.
###589 But I really was just motivated and hungry to ride
###593 and to film.
###593 I wanted to put out these videos every year.
###595 And they were selling well.
###596 And the boards are selling well.
###598 And I was just really motivated to snowboard.
###601 I like snowboarding.
###601 But I would focus on a part every year and try
###604 to make a good part.
###606 And be aware of what I've shot so far this season and
###608 try to mix it up.
###610 And then cap it with Alaska at the end of
###612 year, was always nice.
###613 But definitely made filming a priority and tried to put out
###617 the best part I could every year.
###619 It's always hard.
###620 Everyone wants to one up you every year, or put out a
###622 better part every year.
###623 And that can be tough.
###624 Unfortunately, as I became more popular, I could say,
###628 worldwide, travel becomes a little bit of an issue.
###631 I'm not great with travel.
###632 A lot of times it's not all glory in snowboarding.
###636 I'd go to Japan without my board and do five or six shop
###640 tours in a week.
###642 Sometimes it can be a burden.
###644 I wasn't cut out for that.
###645 A lot of people are like, I want to be sponsored.
###647 I want to be pro.
###648 I'm good enough.
###649 Well how professional are you?
###652 It's a lot of marketing involved and you've got to
###654 present yourself properly and do a lot of stuff you may not
###657 want to do.
###657 That became old, I think, year after year.
###660 I just wanted to snowboard.
###661 Because that's who I was-- a snowboarder.
###662 I wanted to ride powder and go to Alaska.
###664 And I was able to do that, but you just want to snowboard.
###667 And you're like, I rip.
###668 I'm in a video.
###669 I deserve this.
###670 And you think you're everything.
###672 And sure, it's a lot of it.
###674 But there's a lot more that comes with it that you don't
###676 realize when you're young.
###678 --is the start of the beginning of the end.
###683 Woo.
###685 Thanks.
###685 -Hello.
###687 Hello.
###688 
###691 NOAH SALASNEK: Get that thing off me right now.
###692 
###697 -It's been a long day, a long month.
###701 NOAH SALASNEK: A long couple of years, to be honest.
###703 -Just a year.
###705 NOAH SALASNEK: Longer.
###707 -How long?
###709 NOAH SALASNEK: 14.
###711 Just kidding.
###712 That thing's not on, right?
###714 
###719 -God, I look like shit.
###721 NOAH SALASNEK: Yeah, my last few years with Sims, my
###724 contract was up.
###725 And I had wanted to break away from Sims and start this
###729 company with Mack Dawg and Peter Line called Forum.
###732 And I was into it.
###734 And I went to Sims and said, I don't want to re-sign.
###736 And they said hey, we have obligations.
###739 We got you for two more years if we want you.
###741 Line 36 c clearly states--
###745 I didn't fight them on it.
###746 I signed up again and balked on the Forum thing,
###749 unfortunately.
###749 And two years later--
###752 I don't know-- they changed hands again.
###754 Sims had a lot of different CEOs, a lot of different
###757 manufacturers over the years.
###759 And unfortunately, they didn't re-sign me after two years.
###763 They kind of left me hanging.
###764 I was like, whoa, I wanted to break away and do my thing.
###766 Now you're leaving me hanging.
###768 And it was a little late for me to get in on Forum at that
###770 point, obviously.
###772 So that was really unfortunate how that played out.
###775 And I really felt let down.
###777 Man, I had done so much for them over the years, and
###779 kicked me to the curb in late summer without a contract and
###782 no warning.
###782 It's just kind of crazy.
###784 Some 17-year-old team manager--
###786 doesn't seem right.
###787 So I was always a little jaded on that.
###788 I would've appreciated a call from anybody in the office,
###791 maybe even Tom would have been cool. "Hey dude, we're not
###795 going to make a board.
###796 Sorry." But no.
###797 They had some kid come out and tell me they're not going to
###799 re-sign me.
###800 After I begged them to not ride for them to go to this
###802 other company.
###803 So they really, I think, took advantage a little bit.
###806 And unfortunately for me, it didn't pan out that well
###809 afterwards for me.
###810 I would've loved to have been a part of Forum.
###812 JP WALKER: I think probably he was being talked to just
###815 because he was such good friends with Mack Dawg.
###818 And I think I do remember him talking about that actually.
###822 But like I said, around that time-- because I think Forum
###826 started, like '96 or '7 as well, so that was kind of that
###830 same time frame where he was kind of just trying to fade--
###833 or starting to fade out of the scene a little bit.
###837 NOAH SALASNEK: Now looking back on it, I don't know that
###838 I would have been a perfect piece of that puzzle, because
###842 they were so freestyle-oriented--
###844 hand rails, and just kickers, and--
###846 I don't know that they knew that then either.
###847 They just had this idea.
###849 And they wanted me in.
###850 It was a good crew so far.
###851 I wanted in.
###852 JP WALKER: Back then when it started there
###853 wasn't that many people.
###856 He was one of the best freestyle or
###859 jibber dudes, you know?
###859 He wasn't doing , like, crazy rails and stuff like that.
###863 But he was definitely bonking and had like that skate style.
###866 And I know he was friends with Peter Line and stuff.
###869 And then there was only me, Bjorn, and Chris
###872 Dufficy from there.
###873 So it was like, him and Peter could've easily spearheaded
###877 that whole thing together.
###878 And who knows which direction it would've went.
###881 I would have been stoked.
###882 
###885 NOAH SALASNEK: Sims-- when I was growing up snowboarding,
###887 it was like Sims was the board.
###889 Everyone rode Sims.
###891 They were the best boards, probably, back then.
###893 It was incredible to think that I would ride
###897 for them one day.
###898 And when I did, I think it was such a large
###900 entity in my mind.
###901 The Sims name is just a huge name in snowboarding.
###905 I was stoked to ride for them.
###906 And I still am to say that I rode for them.
###909 It just didn't go well at the end.
###911 And everything works out for a reason, I feel like, in life.
###914 And I can't complain.
###915 Should'ves and would'ves will kill you.
###917 And I can sit here all day and say that.
###918 But again, I have no regrets.
###920 And I've had good experiences and a great life in
###923 snowboarding for sure.
###925 JAMIE LYNN: I don't think that opportunity's gone for
###927 someone like Noah.
###929 I really still feel that there's a lot of people out
###932 there that he's touched in a way that has made a difference
###936 in their life.
###937 NOAH SALASNEK: I guess what I've done for
###938 Billabong and Sims--
###940 Billabong, I rode for them, being the only rider for four
###943 or five years.
###943 I felt I helped develop a whole brand there.
###946 And with Sims, I felt I brought them around with
###948 Palmer, brought them kind of back.
###950 And yeah, I don't know.
###951 A lot of it's my first ascents and the actual riding that
###954 I've done that I'm really stoked and proud of.
###956 Not necessarily in my accomplishments and my
###958 professional part, but the riding itself.
###960 And the lines that I've done in Super Spines, and all these
###963 just hairball things--
###965 risked my life.
###966 I'll never forget them.
###968 It was like yesterday I remember these things.
###970 And it's sick, because I have that.
###971 And I'll always have that.
###973 And that's pretty sweet.
###974 And that's the best thing I'll take with me from my
###975 snowboarding is all these experiences and what I've got
###978 to do over the years.
###980 And it's a blessing that companies like Billabong and
###982 DC and Dragon, and people that have
###984 promoted me over the years.
###986 I really appreciate them too.
###987 Because I couldn't have done it without them.
###989 [RUSTLING AND BREATHING]
###1001 NOAH SALASNEK: OK, I'm ready for 10 seconds You
###1010 can count me in.
###1013 
###1063 NOAH SALASNEK: Tell them it's kind of sticky pile in the
###1065 fucking sunlit.
###1068 That cliff was beat.
###1071 That cliff was just beat.
###1073 It was just peppery takeoff huge.
###1077 That snow got jacked.

###1080 It's good in the chute though.
