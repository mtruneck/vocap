###0 [THEME MUSIC]
###33 HAMILTON MORRIS: Since leaving Crescent's peristyle, I've
###36 been plagued by questions regarding the man I saw locked
###40 in the shed.
###42 Unlike classic descriptions of the zombie, this man was not
###45 shy nor sullen.
###47 Indeed, he was screaming.
###50 It would be equally foolish to blindly trust or completely
###53 dismiss what I have seen.
###55 But I can say with certainty that it chilled me to the very
###59 threads of my cultural tapestry.
###61 
###68 Today, I'm going back to the rice fields of Artibonite to
###72 collect the potions that Crescent has promised.
###75 I meet with Alex, who fears Crescent may attempt to rob us
###79 and so has brought his friend from the special forces.
###82 Hamilton.
###83 SERGE: Serge.
###85 HAMILTON MORRIS: Serge serves as the personal bodyguard to
###88 the president's sister's husband.
###91 Alex has brought along a magical potion to protect us.
###96 Serge has brought a duffel bag full of guns and takes a
###100 moment before we leave to hide one under
###103 each seat in the car.
###104 
###109 Again, we drive for many hours and find the roads completely
###114 blocked with a large funeral procession
###117 supporting a wooden coffin.
###119 
###140 As we walk through the fields, I am facing the unknown.
###144 I have no idea what to expect from Crescent.
###147 He could give me the poison, or poison me with the poison,
###150 or shoot me in the face 14 times.
###156 We are deep in the country, and should we need help, it
###159 will be unavailable.
###161 At first, I find this frightening, but I'm comforted
###164 knowing that Alex's lithe, agile body will be quick to
###167 respond to any threats.
###169 
###177 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###179 
###189 HAMILTON MORRIS: We arrive at Crescent's, bearing gifts of
###192 Barbancourt rum to show our goodwill.
###195 He seems pleased, but I'm anxious to see this new poison
###199 and how it might differ from the last, seemingly inactive
###203 powder he gave me.
###205 Can we see the powder, then?
###206 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###208 
###218 ALEX: They call it the weapon.
###220 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###221 
###224 HAMILTON MORRIS: Does he still have any of the
###225 ingredients left over?
###226 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###227 
###230 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###231 
###236 ALEX: He said you can go with him.
###238 HAMILTON MORRIS: OK.
###238 Fantastic.
###241 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###245 SERGE: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###247 
###250 HAMILTON MORRIS: Crescent offers to let me see if a
###252 laboratory, where he concocts his leaf medicines.
###255 But he says that I must accompany him alone, so Alex
###258 stays behind.
###260 
###264 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###265 
###282 HAMILTON MORRIS: Can you ask if I can come closer?
###283 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###287 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###289 
###317 HAMILTON MORRIS: Can you ask him what he was
###317 just crushing up?
###319 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###321 
###326 HAMILTON MORRIS: Ah.
###326 The skull of the boy.
###329 Can you ask him if he has the zombie cucumber?
###333 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###334 
###358 -[SPEAKING CREOLE]
###361 HAMILTON MORRIS: The powder is retrieved from a child's
###363 coffin and presented to me.
###366 I'm delighted to find he's given not only a poison but
###369 also a new powered antidote.
###371 -[SPEAKING CREOLE]
###372 HAMILTON MORRIS: That's the brown container?
###374 -[SPEAKING CREOLE]
###377 HAMILTON MORRIS: How much money does he want for those
###379 two bottles?
###379 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###382 HAMILTON MORRIS: 15, 16, 17, 1,000 US dollars.
###389 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###391 
###404 HAMILTON MORRIS: At last, my mission is accomplished.
###406 Yet, the man holding the poison has a face strikingly
###411 similar to the zombie I saw yesterday.
###413 -[SPEAKING CREOLE]
###415 
###419 HAMILTON MORRIS: Would Crescent make so shameless an
###421 attempt to fool me?
###423 
###426 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###427 
###447 HAMILTON MORRIS: I went to Haiti to investigate a
###450 mystery, and a mystery is exactly what I found.
###454 Upon my return to New York, I bring the powders to the
###458 laboratory of my friend, Jason Wallach.
###463 Hello.
###464 I've brought some samples of zombie poison from Haiti.
###468 JASON WALLACH: All right.
###468 We can look and see what's in these.
###471 HAMILTON MORRIS: He subjects the powder to extensive
###472 chemical analysis.
###474 JASON WALLACH: Let's say 100 milligrams is
###475 probably good to start.
###476 HAMILTON MORRIS: First filtering material to find it
###478 contains a large quantity of sand and numerous unidentified
###482 hairs, likely of goat origin.
###485 The remaining material is then extracted to detect alkaloids
###488 and run through TLC and GCMS.
###490 
###497 When he's finally finished, we can say that we know for
###499 certain the secret ingredients, allele alcohol
###504 and methylparaben, two non-psychoactive chemicals
###507 commonly found in cosmetic products.
###509 
###512 And so our powder is inactive.
###515 Fake is too certain of a word to use, but pharmacologically
###519 speaking, it's certainly inactive.
###523 And in terms of TTX content, the potions Davis collected
###527 were practically inactive as well.
###529 So what can one make of an inactive powder?
###533 Within the magical belief system of Haiti, zombification
###537 would be possible in the absence of any active drug.
###540 That is to say, the pure power of their belief in magic could
###544 produce self-induced, psychological zombification.
###547 
###550 I saw a man in a shed, making some unusual sounds.
###554 Whether his condition was caused by a Bizango bokor, I
###557 cannot say.
###560 In Haiti, I know the placebo can take on new heights of
###563 untold potency.
###565 And whether my inactive poison is truly inactive cannot be
###568 said outside of that strange Caribbean island.
###573 I watched a man in the throes of spiritual possession, and
###576 swam with the puffer, and had a mysterious powder
###579 transdermally applied to my forearm.
###581 But my search is not yet over.
###585 I promised the goddess Erzulie that I would return to Haiti.
###589 And I have no intentions of breaking her vengeful heart.
###592 
###596 WADE DAVIS: We never could prove that Narcisse had gone
###599 through this experience.
###600 My research was totally misinterpreted by the media.
###604 What I had or had not discovered was always kind of
###608 exaggerated.
###609 I was sent down to Haiti by a linear, rational, Descartian
###615 scientist, to quote unquote, "Find the drug that's used to
###618 make zombies." Well, no drug can make a social phenomena.
###622 And in the end, instead of finding the drug used to make
###625 zombies, I found myself investigating the social and
###632 psychological and spiritual and political and historical
###636 dimensions of a chemical possibility.
###639 And the whole purpose of the research, in the end, was not
###643 prove zombies existed, which it did, but really to take a
###649 phenomena, that as I say, had been used in this explicitly
###652 racist way and turn it on its head, make sense of the
###655 sensation, and in doing so, try to draw attention to the
###659 preconceptions and misconceptions that we had
###663 about this extraordinary worldview, of Haitian vodou,
###667 and that this was not a black magic cult, but this was an
###670 amazingly complex metaphysical world.
