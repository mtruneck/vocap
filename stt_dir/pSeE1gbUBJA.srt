CHARLOT DUBOC: Welcome to
"Fashion Week International,"


3
0:0:5,25 --> 0:0:8,119
a new show that reports on the
most fabulous fashion weeks in


4
0:0:8,119 --> 0:0:11,57
the world, and the culture
and politics behind them.


5
0:0:11,57 --> 0:0:18,332
[MUSIC PLAYING]


6
0:0:18,332 --> 0:0:21,56
CHARLOT DUBOC: Have you heard of
Full Figured Fashion Week?


7
0:0:21,56 --> 0:0:23,52
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well,
not really.


8
0:0:23,52 --> 0:0:24,56
FEMALE SPEAKER: No.


9
0:0:24,56 --> 0:0:25,87
FEMALE SPEAKER: What's that?


10
0:0:25,87 --> 0:0:26,51
FEMALE SPEAKER: No.


11
0:0:26,51 --> 0:0:27,63
FEMALE SPEAKER: No, I haven't.


12
0:0:27,63 --> 0:0:29,14
FEMALE SPEAKER: Full Figured
Fashion Week,


13
0:0:29,14 --> 0:0:30,49
what does that mean?


14
0:0:30,49 --> 0:0:35,1
[MUSIC PLAYING]


15
0:0:35,1 --> 0:0:37,58
CHARLOT DUBOC: I was in New
York for fashion week.


16
0:0:37,58 --> 0:0:38,69
No, not that one.


17
0:0:38,69 --> 0:0:41,27
The First Annual Full Figured
Fashion Week.


18
0:0:41,27 --> 0:0:45,565
The dress size in the US
is 14 and growing.


19
0:0:45,565 --> 0:0:48,85
Sick of fad diets and stretchy
muumuu dresses designed to


20
0:0:48,85 --> 0:0:52,43
disguise their lady lumps, these
women want to celebrate


21
0:0:52,43 --> 0:0:56,59
their shape with couture
adaptations and sequins.


22
0:0:56,59 --> 0:0:59,6
I came here to investigate the
extent to which the plus size


23
0:0:59,6 --> 0:1:3,1
industry is really empowering
the fuller figured woman or if


24
0:1:3,1 --> 0:1:5,818
it's simply a case of cashing
in on the fat dollar.


25
0:1:5,818 --> 0:1:8,75



26
0:1:8,75 --> 0:1:14,29
So we're going to the runway
competition to see a load of


27
0:1:14,29 --> 0:1:16,29
models from all over America.


28
0:1:16,29 --> 0:1:20,5
And they're going to just battle
it out on the catwalk.


29
0:1:20,5 --> 0:1:20,82
Where are we going?


30
0:1:20,82 --> 0:1:22,696
Five.


31
0:1:22,696 --> 0:1:24,572
Here we go.


32
0:1:24,572 --> 0:1:26,448
Hey.


33
0:1:26,448 --> 0:1:27,698
How are you doing?


34
0:1:27,698 --> 0:1:30,5



35
0:1:30,5 --> 0:1:31,468
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
good to see you.


36
0:1:31,468 --> 0:1:33,888
MALE SPEAKER: Likewise.


37
0:1:33,888 --> 0:1:35,35
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you
so much for coming.


38
0:1:35,35 --> 0:1:37,902
Put your hands together for
these beautiful ladies who are


39
0:1:37,902 --> 0:1:39,8
going to rock the stage.


40
0:1:39,8 --> 0:1:41,852
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]


41
0:1:41,852 --> 0:1:43,736
FEMALE SPEAKER: Ladies,
are you ready?


42
0:1:43,736 --> 0:1:45,72
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]


43
0:1:45,72 --> 0:1:46,712
FEMALE SPEAKER: Let
me get some music.


44
0:1:46,712 --> 0:1:48,2
DJ, please.


45
0:1:48,2 --> 0:2:1,96
[MUSIC PLAYING]


46
0:2:1,96 --> 0:2:9,57
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]


47
0:2:9,57 --> 0:2:10,889
MALE SPEAKER: Somebody that
wasn't full figured might do


48
0:2:10,889 --> 0:2:12,21
that and they probably would
have broke down and cried.


49
0:2:12,21 --> 0:2:16,372
But her being so confident and
her, she made it work.


50
0:2:16,372 --> 0:2:18,538
And it took a lot of guts
and it took some


51
0:2:18,538 --> 0:2:20,2
fortitude to do that.


52
0:2:20,2 --> 0:2:21,1
And that's what it is.


53
0:2:21,1 --> 0:2:23,35
CHARLOT DUBOC: When you see that
full figure on the cat


54
0:2:23,35 --> 0:2:25,66
walk, what happens?


55
0:2:25,66 --> 0:2:26,57
MALE SPEAKER: I just like
their attitude.


56
0:2:26,57 --> 0:2:29,135
And it surprises me how
confident they are in them


57
0:2:29,135 --> 0:2:31,515
self when society wants them
to be something else.


58
0:2:31,515 --> 0:2:32,3
You know what I mean?


59
0:2:32,3 --> 0:2:33,364
And I'm glad that they
embrace that.


60
0:2:33,364 --> 0:2:39,18
[MUSIC PLAYING]


61
0:2:39,18 --> 0:2:40,23
CHARLOT DUBOC: What are
you looking for?


62
0:2:40,23 --> 0:2:40,98
What makes a winner?


63
0:2:40,98 --> 0:2:43,38
BRANDON: If you feel sexy, if
you feel confident, if you


64
0:2:43,38 --> 0:2:44,89
feel curvy, then you can
work the runway.


65
0:2:44,89 --> 0:2:47,42
With no matter whether you're a
size 2 or a size 22, you can


66
0:2:47,42 --> 0:2:49,21
still do it.


67
0:2:49,21 --> 0:2:50,92
My name is Brandon Coats.


68
0:2:50,92 --> 0:2:51,57
And I'm here today.


69
0:2:51,57 --> 0:2:53,11
And I'm actually judging the
full figured and fabulous


70
0:2:53,11 --> 0:2:54,63
competition.


71
0:2:54,63 --> 0:2:56,4
CHARLOT DUBOC: What do you think
of this whole event?


72
0:2:56,4 --> 0:2:58,1
What do you think of full
figured fashion week?


73
0:2:58,1 --> 0:3:0,34
BRANDON: Plus sized women
for too long have been


74
0:3:0,34 --> 0:3:2,87
marginalized and
not catered to.


75
0:3:2,87 --> 0:3:5,16
So here's actually a market
where we celebrate plus sized


76
0:3:5,16 --> 0:3:6,615
women in all their fabulosity.


77
0:3:6,615 --> 0:3:11,565
[MUSIC PLAYING]


78
0:3:11,565 --> 0:3:12,6
CHARLOT DUBOC: So, hi.


79
0:3:12,6 --> 0:3:15,86
Your wife just won
the competition.


80
0:3:15,86 --> 0:3:16,99
How do you feel?


81
0:3:16,99 --> 0:3:18,44
MALE SPEAKER: I'm a lucky man.


82
0:3:18,44 --> 0:3:20,44
I mean, not a lot of people can
say that they're married


83
0:3:20,44 --> 0:3:20,88
to a model.


84
0:3:20,88 --> 0:3:21,876
Bigger is better.


85
0:3:21,876 --> 0:3:22,872
What can I say?


86
0:3:22,872 --> 0:3:25,86
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]


87
0:3:25,86 --> 0:3:27,852
FEMALE SPEAKER: I am ecstatic.


88
0:3:27,852 --> 0:3:31,58
I mean, words can't really
express exactly how I feel.


89
0:3:31,58 --> 0:3:33,56
I've worked so hard for this.


90
0:3:33,56 --> 0:3:37,23
You know, you can be full
figured and healthy.


91
0:3:37,23 --> 0:3:38,91
CHARLOT DUBOC: One of the
hilarious things that somebody


92
0:3:38,91 --> 0:3:41,915
said to me was, it's hard to be
a full figured runway model


93
0:3:41,915 --> 0:3:44,22
because your thighs rub together
and people don't


94
0:3:44,22 --> 0:3:45,214
realize that.


95
0:3:45,214 --> 0:3:47,202
[LAUGHTER]


96
0:3:47,202 --> 0:3:49,19
FEMALE SPEAKER: That
is a problem.


97
0:3:49,19 --> 0:3:51,61
CHARLOT DUBOC: And did
you feel emotional?


98
0:3:51,61 --> 0:3:52,602
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I did.


99
0:3:52,602 --> 0:3:53,84
I did.


100
0:3:53,84 --> 0:3:54,53
I'll cry later.


101
0:3:54,53 --> 0:3:54,63
CHARLOT DUBOC: But what--


102
0:3:54,63 --> 0:3:54,935
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


103
0:3:54,935 --> 0:3:56,93
MALE SPEAKER: Wait until it just
becomes fashion, not full


104
0:3:56,93 --> 0:4:1,84
figured, not, you know, regular
figured, just fashion.


105
0:4:1,84 --> 0:4:5,4
[MUSIC PLAYING]


106
0:4:5,4 --> 0:4:7,46
CHARLOT DUBOC: After a raucous
start to the week, I went to


107
0:4:7,46 --> 0:4:8,9
find out a bit about
the shopping


108
0:4:8,9 --> 0:4:10,39
options for these women.


109
0:4:10,39 --> 0:4:14,248
So we headed to a sample sale
organized by the fashion week.


110
0:4:14,248 --> 0:4:15,986
What's this?


111
0:4:15,986 --> 0:4:18,19
Curves in the City
Sample Sale.


112
0:4:18,19 --> 0:4:18,8
Oh. my god.


113
0:4:18,8 --> 0:4:22,69
So it's like "Sex in the City,"
but not at all like


114
0:4:22,69 --> 0:4:24,416
"Sex in the City."


115
0:4:24,416 --> 0:4:32,691
I don't know if I'm going to
be the only empty figured


116
0:4:32,691 --> 0:4:35,9
person there.


117
0:4:35,9 --> 0:4:35,82
Hi.


118
0:4:35,82 --> 0:4:36,492
MALE SPEAKER: Good morning.


119
0:4:36,492 --> 0:4:38,11
CHARLOT DUBOC: This way is
for the sample sale?


120
0:4:38,11 --> 0:4:38,455
MALE SPEAKER: Yes, it is.


121
0:4:38,455 --> 0:4:38,92
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.


122
0:4:38,92 --> 0:4:39,655
CHARLOT DUBOC: Thank you.


123
0:4:39,655 --> 0:4:40,905
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


124
0:4:40,905 --> 0:4:44,64



125
0:4:44,64 --> 0:4:46,22
CHARLOT DUBOC: Over there's
Brenda [INAUDIBLE]


126
0:4:46,22 --> 0:4:48,164
She's the organizer for
the whole thing.


127
0:4:48,164 --> 0:4:51,56
We've heard she's a bit of a
force to be reckoned with.


128
0:4:51,56 --> 0:4:51,538
Hi.


129
0:4:51,538 --> 0:4:52,502
I'm Charlot.


130
0:4:52,502 --> 0:4:53,707
FEMALE SPEAKER: Charlot,
finally I got a


131
0:4:53,707 --> 0:4:55,394
chance to meet you.


132
0:4:55,394 --> 0:4:57,804
CHARLOT DUBOC: I wanted you to
show us your favorite store.


133
0:4:57,804 --> 0:4:58,286
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh.


134
0:4:58,286 --> 0:5:0,78
It's going to be hard to narrow
that down, but I think


135
0:5:0,78 --> 0:5:1,446
I know just the person.


136
0:5:1,446 --> 0:5:2,444
CHARLOT DUBOC: Come on, then.


137
0:5:2,444 --> 0:5:2,943
FEMALE SPEAKER: Come on.


138
0:5:2,943 --> 0:5:3,442
Let's go shopping.


139
0:5:3,442 --> 0:5:7,25
This is the layer patch leather
dress, which she has.


140
0:5:7,25 --> 0:5:10,47
This is the royal fishtail
dress, which she has.


141
0:5:10,47 --> 0:5:13,79
This is the stormy mesh dress,
which is fabulous.


142
0:5:13,79 --> 0:5:16,54
It could be worn in the
summertime and wintertime,


143
0:5:16,54 --> 0:5:18,106
which she has.


144
0:5:18,106 --> 0:5:21,4
FEMALE SPEAKER: You just can't
get this type of fashion in


145
0:5:21,4 --> 0:5:24,0
those sizes so readily
available.


146
0:5:24,0 --> 0:5:25,832
With her, you just go online
and it's there.


147
0:5:25,832 --> 0:5:27,34
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, anything
with ruffles, flowers, that's


148
0:5:27,34 --> 0:5:28,35
all me right there.


149
0:5:28,35 --> 0:5:30,14
Oh, this is beautiful!


150
0:5:30,14 --> 0:5:30,88
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wear
your curves.


151
0:5:30,88 --> 0:5:31,54
Love your curves.


152
0:5:31,54 --> 0:5:33,6
Show your curves.


153
0:5:33,6 --> 0:5:36,35
FEMALE SPEAKER: I wrote this
book, "Stop Dieting Now." It


154
0:5:36,35 --> 0:5:39,47
really becomes the focus of your
life when you're trying


155
0:5:39,47 --> 0:5:40,24
to lose weight all the time.


156
0:5:40,24 --> 0:5:42,2
Diets create anorexic
thinking.


157
0:5:42,2 --> 0:5:44,74
And if you talk to someone who's
had anorexia and you


158
0:5:44,74 --> 0:5:47,25
talk to someone who is dieting,
the way they talk


159
0:5:47,25 --> 0:5:48,88
about food is very similar.


160
0:5:48,88 --> 0:5:51,53
The diet industry needs
you to fail.


161
0:5:51,53 --> 0:5:53,73
But I also get a lot
of backlash.


162
0:5:53,73 --> 0:5:55,5
CHARLOT DUBOC: What are the
sort of negative things do


163
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:55,93
people say?


164
0:5:55,93 --> 0:5:57,84
FEMALE SPEAKER: Everything from
just repeating the same


165
0:5:57,84 --> 0:5:59,97
diet paradigm of like, well,
it's just calories in,


166
0:5:59,97 --> 0:6:0,47
calories out.


167
0:6:0,47 --> 0:6:1,4
About you don't--


168
0:6:1,4 --> 0:6:2,266
You know, all that.


169
0:6:2,266 --> 0:6:5,524
To, you know, you should
go die, you know.


170
0:6:5,524 --> 0:6:6,29
So, yeah.


171
0:6:6,29 --> 0:6:9,295
It's pretty crazy.


172
0:6:9,295 --> 0:6:12,99
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right now what
you're looking at is our True


173
0:6:12,99 --> 0:6:16,879
Sheroes, plus size,
curvy comic book.


174
0:6:16,879 --> 0:6:17,873
CHARLOT DUBOC: Are you here?


175
0:6:17,873 --> 0:6:18,867
FEMALE SPEAKER: And I'm here.


176
0:6:18,867 --> 0:6:19,861
CHARLOT DUBOC: That's you?


177
0:6:19,861 --> 0:6:20,855
What are your super powers?


178
0:6:20,855 --> 0:6:22,346
FEMALE SPEAKER: My super
power is I get my


179
0:6:22,346 --> 0:6:23,34
powers from the sun.


180
0:6:23,34 --> 0:6:25,33
She gets hers from the
gamma-ray bursts.


181
0:6:25,33 --> 0:6:28,53
Then you have one with the
strength of 1,000 men.


182
0:6:28,53 --> 0:6:29,55
That's pretty much
what we are.


183
0:6:29,55 --> 0:6:31,15
We're not a fat girl movement.


184
0:6:31,15 --> 0:6:33,5
We're all about the
woman with curves.


185
0:6:33,5 --> 0:6:34,48
That's just who we are.


186
0:6:34,48 --> 0:6:35,605
CHARLOT DUBOC: Tell us
what you've got on.


187
0:6:35,605 --> 0:6:37,46
It's really cute.


188
0:6:37,46 --> 0:6:37,81
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.


189
0:6:37,81 --> 0:6:38,83
This is body jewelry.


190
0:6:38,83 --> 0:6:40,82
I don't know exactly
what it is.


191
0:6:40,82 --> 0:6:42,32
CHARLOT DUBOC: So you're not
supposed to wear it with


192
0:6:42,32 --> 0:6:42,92
nothing else?


193
0:6:42,92 --> 0:6:45,1
[LAUGHTER]


194
0:6:45,1 --> 0:6:46,29
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, my God.


195
0:6:46,29 --> 0:6:47,23
We're feeling fabulous.


196
0:6:47,23 --> 0:6:50,6
No, you always have an outfit
under there, especially if


197
0:6:50,6 --> 0:6:51,4
you're under 21.


198
0:6:51,4 --> 0:6:53,44
But if you're over 21 and
married like me and do it,


199
0:6:53,44 --> 0:6:54,24
it'll be just fine.


200
0:6:54,24 --> 0:6:54,71
Rock it!


201
0:6:54,71 --> 0:6:55,59
I say, rock it!


202
0:6:55,59 --> 0:6:56,474
[LAUGHTER]


203
0:6:56,474 --> 0:6:56,916
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.


204
0:6:56,916 --> 0:6:58,69
I could tell you how
you grow your tits.


205
0:6:58,69 --> 0:7:0,76
You and I can go together
because I need to lift mine


206
0:7:0,76 --> 0:7:1,92
up, suck it out there.


207
0:7:1,92 --> 0:7:3,13
They're going to suck
it out of me.


208
0:7:3,13 --> 0:7:4,615
Put it in you.


209
0:7:4,615 --> 0:7:7,76
FEMALE SPEAKER: Don't hate
'cause I just ate.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


211
0:7:14,65 --> 0:7:16,18
CHARLOT DUBOC: We're going
to the world's


212
0:7:16,18 --> 0:7:17,902
largest fitness class.


213
0:7:17,902 --> 0:7:20,332
It's called Walking Curves.


214
0:7:20,332 --> 0:7:22,762
I kind of didn't
dress properly.


215
0:7:22,762 --> 0:7:25,192
But I'm going to do my best.


216
0:7:25,192 --> 0:7:28,13
[MUSIC PLAYING]


217
0:7:28,13 --> 0:7:29,91
CHARLOT DUBOC: What
is your aim here?


218
0:7:29,91 --> 0:7:32,6
You don't want to lose
your curves.


219
0:7:32,6 --> 0:7:32,998
FEMALE SPEAKER: People
have a misconception


220
0:7:32,998 --> 0:7:34,982
about what health is.


221
0:7:34,982 --> 0:7:37,958
You know, just because you're
a person of a certain size,


222
0:7:37,958 --> 0:7:39,446
they equate that to
being unhealthy.


223
0:7:39,446 --> 0:7:40,438
But that's a misnomer.


224
0:7:40,438 --> 0:7:41,93
Because a person that's
a smaller


225
0:7:41,93 --> 0:7:43,42
size could be unhealthy.


226
0:7:43,42 --> 0:7:45,81
But because of the way
they look, you think


227
0:7:45,81 --> 0:7:46,56
that they're healthy.


228
0:7:46,56 --> 0:7:49,7
We got to help each other
along the journey.


229
0:7:49,7 --> 0:7:50,882
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
let's do it!


230
0:7:50,882 --> 0:7:51,333
FEMALE SPEAKER: Woo hoo!


231
0:7:51,333 --> 0:7:52,235
Walking Curves!


232
0:7:52,235 --> 0:7:54,4
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]


233
0:7:54,4 --> 0:7:55,14
MALE SPEAKER: So what
we're going to do


234
0:7:55,14 --> 0:7:56,34
is called the wobble.


235
0:7:56,34 --> 0:7:57,831
Have y'all heard
of the wobble?


236
0:7:57,831 --> 0:7:58,328
[SCREAMING AND CHEERING]


237
0:7:58,328 --> 0:8:0,813
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.


238
0:8:0,813 --> 0:8:2,304
The wobble.


239
0:8:2,304 --> 0:8:19,699
[MUSIC PLAYING]


240
0:8:19,699 --> 0:8:23,38
FEMALE SPEAKER: I just want to
thank you all for coming to


241
0:8:23,38 --> 0:8:26,0
Walking Curves national debut.


242
0:8:26,0 --> 0:8:27,63
We might be a small group,
baby, but we


243
0:8:27,63 --> 0:8:29,52
pack a mighty punch.


244
0:8:29,52 --> 0:8:31,99
[MUSIC PLAYING]


245
0:8:31,99 --> 0:8:35,9
CHARLOT DUBOC: Considering 78%
of Americans don't meet the


246
0:8:35,9 --> 0:8:38,37
basic recommended activity
level, it was encouraging to


247
0:8:38,37 --> 0:8:40,3
see that such an event
was part of the


248
0:8:40,3 --> 0:8:42,429
fashion week schedule.


249
0:8:42,429 --> 0:8:46,56
But just a stone throw across
town, nothing tastes as good


250
0:8:46,56 --> 0:8:48,49
as being thin feels.


251
0:8:48,49 --> 0:8:51,44
We headed to New York's high-end
shopping district to


252
0:8:51,44 --> 0:8:54,365
try and get an idea of how size
is perceived among the


253
0:8:54,365 --> 0:8:57,66
city's most discerning
fashion consumers.


254
0:8:57,66 --> 0:9:0,91
Do you think stores like
Chanel or any high-end


255
0:9:0,91 --> 0:9:4,56
boutique should be stocking
above a size 12?


256
0:9:4,56 --> 0:9:6,88
FEMALE SPEAKER: I can't believe
I'm saying this, but I


257
0:9:6,88 --> 0:9:7,96
don't think so.


258
0:9:7,96 --> 0:9:9,87
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think that
people who are into high


259
0:9:9,87 --> 0:9:13,44
fashion are very conscious
of the way they look.


260
0:9:13,44 --> 0:9:17,29
And part of the way they look
dictates how much they weigh.


261
0:9:17,29 --> 0:9:17,56
FEMALE SPEAKER: I don't know.


262
0:9:17,56 --> 0:9:18,81
It's harder to make something
fashionable


263
0:9:18,81 --> 0:9:20,88
if it's really large.


264
0:9:20,88 --> 0:9:24,31
FEMALE SPEAKER: There are enough
secluded stores who


265
0:9:24,31 --> 0:9:29,22
only exclusively sell
over size 14.


266
0:9:29,22 --> 0:9:30,54
FEMALE SPEAKER: It just
depends on the person.


267
0:9:30,54 --> 0:9:33,762
If you see a size 22 woman, you
know, slumping around in a


268
0:9:33,762 --> 0:9:35,78
big, you know, potato sack, she
might not be attractive.


269
0:9:35,78 --> 0:9:37,9
But if you see her in a
beautiful dress with lots of


270
0:9:37,9 --> 0:9:40,385
confidence, I think that's just
as beautiful and fabulous


271
0:9:40,385 --> 0:9:41,78
as a skinny girl.


272
0:9:41,78 --> 0:9:43,5
CHARLOT DUBOC: If you went to
bed tonight, woke up tomorrow,


273
0:9:43,5 --> 0:9:46,28
and you're a size 22,
what would you do?


274
0:9:46,28 --> 0:9:47,226
FEMALE SPEAKER: Ooh.


275
0:9:47,226 --> 0:9:49,12
I think I'd go to the gym.


276
0:9:49,12 --> 0:9:51,265
FEMALE SPEAKER: I would probably
go on an immediate


277
0:9:51,265 --> 0:9:53,99
diet because I would
feel awful.


278
0:9:53,99 --> 0:9:58,2
I wouldn't leave my house
until I lost 100 pounds.


279
0:9:58,2 --> 0:10:0,96
FEMALE SPEAKER: I would probably
start balling.


280
0:10:0,96 --> 0:10:1,87
That sounds terrible.


281
0:10:1,87 --> 0:10:3,96
But I'm actually on my
way to go shopping.


282
0:10:3,96 --> 0:10:7,2
And I do know that if I go
shopping and I've just eaten,


283
0:10:7,2 --> 0:10:9,38
I don't feel as good when I'm
trying on the clothes.


284
0:10:9,38 --> 0:10:11,72
Just because everyone gets,
like, a little natural pooch


285
0:10:11,72 --> 0:10:12,16
after they eat.


286
0:10:12,16 --> 0:10:14,17
You know, it's totally
natural.


287
0:10:14,17 --> 0:10:16,58
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I think
they'd be wasting their time.


288
0:10:16,58 --> 0:10:19,32
I think they should do
petite departments.


289
0:10:19,32 --> 0:10:22,26
That's where it's at
for high fashion.


290
0:10:22,26 --> 0:10:24,78
[MUSIC PLAYING]


291
0:10:24,78 --> 0:10:26,41
CHARLOT DUBOC: Dispute the
general feeling that plus


292
0:10:26,41 --> 0:10:28,89
sized fashion should be kept in
the back of the high street


293
0:10:28,89 --> 0:10:32,2
department stores, there are
numerous independent boutiques


294
0:10:32,2 --> 0:10:35,8
popping up around the city such
as Redress, a plus sized


295
0:10:35,8 --> 0:10:38,715
vintage store in Brooklyn
where I met Glen.


296
0:10:38,715 --> 0:10:40,32
Glen, where are we?


297
0:10:40,32 --> 0:10:41,1
What is this place?


298
0:10:41,1 --> 0:10:44,1
GLEN: Well, you're at Redress
New York City.


299
0:10:44,1 --> 0:10:49,42
It's a vintage and resale
clothing shop


300
0:10:49,42 --> 0:10:52,47
for plus size folks.


301
0:10:52,47 --> 0:10:54,91
The teggings are
really popular.


302
0:10:54,91 --> 0:10:57,55
People come specifically
for it.


303
0:10:57,55 --> 0:11:2,29
People will follow us on
Facebook or Twitter, come in


304
0:11:2,29 --> 0:11:4,54
town from, like,
North Carolina.


305
0:11:4,54 --> 0:11:7,26
And be like, where
are the teggings?


306
0:11:7,26 --> 0:11:10,6
Because it's like a tight
and legging hybrid.


307
0:11:10,6 --> 0:11:13,83
They're one size fits all, which
we do not say lightly.


308
0:11:13,83 --> 0:11:15,63
We're not the kind of shop
that's going to be like, one


309
0:11:15,63 --> 0:11:16,27
size fits all.


310
0:11:16,27 --> 0:11:19,31
Because that would make someone
feel really crappy if


311
0:11:19,31 --> 0:11:21,7
we're like, one size fits all
and it didn't fit me.


312
0:11:21,7 --> 0:11:23,93
I'd be, like, man,
that's not right.


313
0:11:23,93 --> 0:11:26,62
That says one size fits all
and it doesn't fit me.


314
0:11:26,62 --> 0:11:27,71
Your store sucks.


315
0:11:27,71 --> 0:11:29,21
But these--


316
0:11:29,21 --> 0:11:30,81
I don't know what this
is made out of.


317
0:11:30,81 --> 0:11:33,12
It's some magic material.


318
0:11:33,12 --> 0:11:34,16
It's super comfortable.


319
0:11:34,16 --> 0:11:36,53
It doesn't dig into you.


320
0:11:36,53 --> 0:11:38,17
These little pins are $1 here.


321
0:11:38,17 --> 0:11:39,29
And people buy them.


322
0:11:39,29 --> 0:11:41,65
And they say things like,
there's no wrong way to have a


323
0:11:41,65 --> 0:11:46,26
body, back fat is the
new cleavage.


324
0:11:46,26 --> 0:11:53,76
My background is in queer,
radical, sex positivity.


325
0:11:53,76 --> 0:11:58,73
And so that's my answer to how I
learned to know that it's OK


326
0:11:58,73 --> 0:12:2,62
to have any kind of
body and feel hot.


327
0:12:2,62 --> 0:12:4,19
But it's definitely a journey.


328
0:12:4,19 --> 0:12:7,12
You got to work a little
bit to get the party.


329
0:12:7,12 --> 0:12:9,35
[MUSIC PLAYING]


330
0:12:9,35 --> 0:12:11,35
CHARLOT DUBOC: It seemed
appropriate that the finale


331
0:12:11,35 --> 0:12:14,88
fashion show would be held in
the outsized, overstimulating


332
0:12:14,88 --> 0:12:18,0
phenomenon that is
Times Square.


333
0:12:18,0 --> 0:12:21,25
I got the feeling that what the
event lacked in subtlety


334
0:12:21,25 --> 0:12:24,185
would be made up for in pure
entertainment value.


335
0:12:24,185 --> 0:12:27,9
So we're going to go and see
what's going on backstage


336
0:12:27,9 --> 0:12:30,36
because that's probably where
all the action is.


337
0:12:30,36 --> 0:12:33,3



338
0:12:33,3 --> 0:12:34,55
Hi.


339
0:12:34,55 --> 0:12:37,71



340
0:12:37,71 --> 0:12:39,42
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're backstage
at Full Figured


341
0:12:39,42 --> 0:12:41,28
Fashion Week and we're
getting ready to go.


342
0:12:41,28 --> 0:12:44,62
I got my iPod so I can
get my music going.


343
0:12:44,62 --> 0:12:45,93
And we're ready to
hit the runway.


344
0:12:45,93 --> 0:12:46,73
We're ready to go.


345
0:12:46,73 --> 0:12:46,997
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.


346
0:12:46,997 --> 0:12:47,86
Yes.


347
0:12:47,86 --> 0:12:48,71
Yes.


348
0:12:48,71 --> 0:12:49,61
FEMALE SPEAKER: Could
you do me a favor?


349
0:12:49,61 --> 0:12:51,52
You could do your hair back like
that when you're walking


350
0:12:51,52 --> 0:12:52,13
down the runway.


351
0:12:52,13 --> 0:12:52,73
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sure.


352
0:12:52,73 --> 0:12:55,23
FEMALE SPEAKER: It takes a lot
for a woman to be able to hold


353
0:12:55,23 --> 0:12:57,21
this and be confident with it.


354
0:12:57,21 --> 0:12:58,76
And I love it.


355
0:12:58,76 --> 0:13:0,2
I just love my curves.


356
0:13:0,2 --> 0:13:1,67
I love how they move.


357
0:13:1,67 --> 0:13:4,78
I wouldn't wish to
be any other way.


358
0:13:4,78 --> 0:13:6,61
FEMALE SPEAKER: This group of
people, all these designers,


359
0:13:6,61 --> 0:13:9,8
were shunned by Mercedes
Benz Fashion Week.


360
0:13:9,8 --> 0:13:11,22
And they don't think we're
real designers.


361
0:13:11,22 --> 0:13:13,9
And I think they don't think
we're real women.


362
0:13:13,9 --> 0:13:15,94
And we are real women who are
deserving of fashion.


363
0:13:15,94 --> 0:13:18,5
We are deserving of couture.


364
0:13:18,5 --> 0:13:21,73
And it's a mission of mine to
keep pushing the envelope


365
0:13:21,73 --> 0:13:23,68
until we can get into
one of those shows.


366
0:13:23,68 --> 0:13:25,15
Because we need to
be represented.


367
0:13:25,15 --> 0:13:26,352
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're
going to be doing


368
0:13:26,352 --> 0:13:27,555
pirouettes and turning.


369
0:13:27,555 --> 0:13:29,48
And doing all sorts of things.


370
0:13:29,48 --> 0:13:30,74
FEMALE SPEAKER: We have
about eight minutes


371
0:13:30,74 --> 0:13:31,86
until the show starts.


372
0:13:31,86 --> 0:13:34,5
Everyone's going
a little crazy.


373
0:13:34,5 --> 0:13:36,0
I'm sure that most of
the models have


374
0:13:36,0 --> 0:13:37,986
butterflies just like I do.


375
0:13:37,986 --> 0:13:40,34

you ready for fashion?

CHARLOT DUBOC: I've never seen
full figured women presented


382
0:14:31,43 --> 0:14:33,44
in this way or move
in that way.


383
0:14:33,44 --> 0:14:34,146
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's
ovehwhelming.


384
0:14:34,146 --> 0:14:38,8
What it is is that we're not
used to seeing that.


385
0:14:38,8 --> 0:14:42,22
Like, women being so confident
about their size and embracing


386
0:14:42,22 --> 0:14:44,93
it, and loving it, and out there
with clothing that you


387
0:14:44,93 --> 0:14:46,996
would never think
to see them in.


388
0:14:46,996 --> 0:14:47,868
It is emotional.

CHARLOT DUBOC: It
is, isn't it?


390
0:14:49,14 --> 0:14:52,138
FEMALE SPEAKER: And I
cry at everything.


391
0:14:52,138 --> 0:14:56,72
I have to tell you my
mom was a big woman.


392
0:14:56,72 --> 0:14:59,93

was poly and ester.

know about that.


395
0:15:2,8 --> 0:15:6,99
And to see the fashion today,
it's ridiculous.


396
0:15:6,99 --> 0:15:11,57
I mean, one sleeved dresses,
sequins, it's just so much


397
0:15:11,57 --> 0:15:13,71
beautiful fashion
to choose from.


398
0:15:13,71 --> 0:15:16,6
And we're blessed to
have it today.


399
0:15:16,6 --> 0:15:17,47
You guys looks beautiful.


400
0:15:17,47 --> 0:15:21,34
Please give a big hand and
applause for yourselves for


401
0:15:21,34 --> 0:15:22,66
being here.


402
0:15:22,66 --> 0:15:24,54
FEMALE SPEAKER: They get excited
when you're excited.


403
0:15:24,54 --> 0:15:25,76
I'm not excited.


404
0:15:25,76 --> 0:15:27,144
Why are you in my face?


405
0:15:27,144 --> 0:15:28,32
[LAUGHTER]


406
0:15:28,32 --> 0:15:31,37
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sergeant
Runway, here.


407
0:15:31,37 --> 0:15:34,17
CHARLOT DUBOC: I'm no stranger
to the bi-annual fashion week


408
0:15:34,17 --> 0:15:36,24
rip tour of the big
four, London, New


409
0:15:36,24 --> 0:15:38,35
York, Paris, and Milan.


410
0:15:38,35 --> 0:15:41,22
There can be nothing so dull
as watching cadaverous,


411
0:15:41,22 --> 0:15:44,16
androgynous-looking models walk
past you in clothes and


412
0:15:44,16 --> 0:15:47,21
only just make it back
up the runway alive.


413
0:15:47,21 --> 0:15:49,97
The atmosphere at Full Figured
Fashion Week was brimming with


414
0:15:49,97 --> 0:15:52,37
a sense of triumph and unity--


415
0:15:52,37 --> 0:15:54,435
nothing short of
life affirming.


416
0:15:54,435 --> 0:15:57,12
It was very much a case of the
girls wearing the clothes


417
0:15:57,12 --> 0:15:59,832
rather than the clothes
wearing them.


418
0:15:59,832 --> 0:16:3,12
As a result, I nearly forgot to
look at the clothes, some


419
0:16:3,12 --> 0:16:6,516
of which were outlandish, others
frankly quite ugly.


420
0:16:6,516 --> 0:16:8,795
But the girls rocked
every last piece.


421
0:16:8,795 --> 0:16:11,645



422
0:16:11,645 --> 0:16:12,79
What are you doing
here tonight?


423
0:16:12,79 --> 0:16:15,837
MALE SPEAKER: I'm here to see
beautiful full figured women.


424
0:16:15,837 --> 0:16:16,775
CHARLOT DUBOC: That's
so great.


425
0:16:16,775 --> 0:16:19,12
So you're a fan of the
fuller figured lady?


426
0:16:19,12 --> 0:16:19,496
MALE SPEAKER: I am.


427
0:16:19,496 --> 0:16:20,4
I am.


428
0:16:20,4 --> 0:16:20,64
Yes.


429
0:16:20,64 --> 0:16:22,51
It's all, like, shape and
proportion really.


430
0:16:22,51 --> 0:16:25,817
And I like curves and voluptuous
women, really.


431
0:16:25,817 --> 0:16:28,632
And I'm here to hopefully get
some phone numbers and meet


432
0:16:28,632 --> 0:16:29,793
some new chicks.


433
0:16:29,793 --> 0:16:31,781
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're showing
women that are classy.


434
0:16:31,781 --> 0:16:33,28
Woman that love their bodies.


435
0:16:33,28 --> 0:16:34,83
Women that are confident.


436
0:16:34,83 --> 0:16:36,9
And we're showing women
that are fashionable.


437
0:16:36,9 --> 0:16:38,77
And they will strut
their stuff.


438
0:16:38,77 --> 0:16:40,84
They show what they got to show
and they have attitude.


439
0:16:40,84 --> 0:16:41,875
And they respect themselves.


440
0:16:41,875 --> 0:16:44,95
And absolutely, we need to
showcase that in the US and


441
0:16:44,95 --> 0:16:45,78
around the world.


442
0:16:45,78 --> 0:16:48,392
Men need to understand that we
are a whole lot of women


443
0:16:48,392 --> 0:16:50,84
looking for a whole
lot of man.


444
0:16:50,84 --> 0:16:52,29
MALE SPEAKER: There were some
that shouldn't have been in


445
0:16:52,29 --> 0:16:53,292
high heels.


446
0:16:53,292 --> 0:16:56,48
And there were some that I would
have rather seen in just


447
0:16:56,48 --> 0:16:58,77
high heels, just by their
self, high heels


448
0:16:58,77 --> 0:16:59,6
and birthday suits.


449
0:16:59,6 --> 0:17:2,0
But, you know, 12 and
up, light skin,


450
0:17:2,0 --> 0:17:3,302
long hair, don't care.


451
0:17:3,302 --> 0:17:5,126
That's how we getting it.


452
0:17:5,126 --> 0:17:6,95
CHARLOT DUBOC: It's
all finished.


453
0:17:6,95 --> 0:17:11,18
And I have been honestly
overwhelmed.


454
0:17:11,18 --> 0:17:15,13
Because I've never seen women,
full figured women, presented


455
0:17:15,13 --> 0:17:19,319
in that way, celebrated in that
way, moving in that way


456
0:17:19,319 --> 0:17:23,225
to the extent that I feel like
if I woke up tomorrow and I


457
0:17:23,225 --> 0:17:29,53
was a size 16, 20, or 22,
I'd be like, let's go.


458
0:17:29,53 --> 0:17:31,115
And that is amazing.


459
0:17:31,115 --> 0:17:35,34
And I just think if the rest
of the world were affected


460
0:17:35,34 --> 0:17:39,22
like I was, then things
would improve.


461
0:17:39,22 --> 0:17:41,22
And I just think everyone's
got it wrong.


462
0:17:41,22 --> 0:17:44,65
Everyone's had it so
wrong for so long.


463
0:17:44,65 --> 0:17:45,69
And, I mean, hell.


464
0:17:45,69 --> 0:17:47,379
These women are hot.


465
0:17:47,379 --> 0:17:53,61
[MUSIC PLAYING]


466
0:17:53,61 --> 0:17:56,4
CHARLOT DUBOC: To top it all
off, we were invited on a


467
0:17:56,4 --> 0:17:58,79
celebratory cruise around
Manhattan Island


468
0:17:58,79 --> 0:18:1,91
called Curves at Sea.


469
0:18:1,91 --> 0:18:2,65
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good evening.


470
0:18:2,65 --> 0:18:5,44
[LAUGHTER]


471
0:18:5,44 --> 0:18:5,54
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.


472
0:18:5,54 --> 0:18:8,659
Would you guys stop rocking
in the boat, please.


473
0:18:8,659 --> 0:18:13,29
Full Figured Fashion Week
started sort of like a little


474
0:18:13,29 --> 0:18:14,51
dream of mine.


475
0:18:14,51 --> 0:18:17,807
I went to my first fashion
event and I sat there.


476
0:18:17,807 --> 0:18:20,633
And I said, something's
not right about this.


477
0:18:20,633 --> 0:18:24,295
There had to be other curvy
girls in the world such as


478
0:18:24,295 --> 0:18:27,46
myself who want to go to Fashion
Week and be able to


479
0:18:27,46 --> 0:18:31,31
see the fashions come alive
via curvy models.


480
0:18:31,31 --> 0:18:32,61
And they want to buy.


481
0:18:32,61 --> 0:18:34,605
Because you want to
know something?


482
0:18:34,605 --> 0:18:39,12
We have an incredible amount
of power through


483
0:18:39,12 --> 0:18:40,58
our spending dollars.


484
0:18:40,58 --> 0:18:42,92
What do you say?


485
0:18:42,92 --> 0:18:44,16
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]


486
0:18:44,16 --> 0:18:44,978
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.


487
0:18:44,978 --> 0:18:46,421
So I'm sitting there.


488
0:18:46,421 --> 0:18:47,864
And I'm like, you know what?


489
0:18:47,864 --> 0:18:49,79
I need to do something
about this.


490
0:18:49,79 --> 0:18:53,1
I am going to create my own
full figured fashion week.


491
0:18:53,1 --> 0:18:54,5
And guess what?


492
0:18:54,5 --> 0:18:56,21
The rest is freaking history.


493
0:18:56,21 --> 0:18:59,934
So put your hands together
for Ms. Shonda Freeman.


494
0:18:59,934 --> 0:19:3,726
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]


495
0:19:3,726 --> 0:19:4,2
SHONDA: Thank you.


496
0:19:4,2 --> 0:19:5,86
Thank you all so much.


497
0:19:5,86 --> 0:19:11,245
I just wanted to say that for
me, Gwen came to me at a time


498
0:19:11,245 --> 0:19:12,219
in my life--


499
0:19:12,219 --> 0:19:13,68
GLEN: Oh, Lord Jesus.


500
0:19:13,68 --> 0:19:14,93
SHONDA: I'm sorry.


501
0:19:14,93 --> 0:19:17,576



502
0:19:17,576 --> 0:19:19,524
I just lost my mom.


503
0:19:19,524 --> 0:19:23,907



504
0:19:23,907 --> 0:19:25,64
And [INAUDIBLE]


505
0:19:25,64 --> 0:19:30,432
understand, it's not
about fashion.


506
0:19:30,432 --> 0:19:36,75
It is about respect,
inspiration, and all of us


507
0:19:36,75 --> 0:19:39,18
empowering each other.


508
0:19:39,18 --> 0:19:45,274
I feel like Full Figured Fashion
Week is a sisterhood.


509
0:19:45,274 --> 0:19:47,3
And just God bless all of you.


510
0:19:47,3 --> 0:19:47,68
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes, he is.


511
0:19:47,68 --> 0:19:48,89
SHONDA: And keep you safe.


512
0:19:48,89 --> 0:19:51,23
And always a lady first.


513
0:19:51,23 --> 0:19:52,166
Thank you.


514
0:19:52,166 --> 0:19:54,51
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]


515
0:19:54,51 --> 0:19:55,6
FEMALE SPEAKER: Repeat
after me.


516
0:19:55,6 --> 0:19:55,521
Size!


517
0:19:55,521 --> 0:19:56,443
ALL: Size!


518
0:19:56,443 --> 0:19:57,826
FEMALE SPEAKER: Doesn't
bury our!


519
0:19:57,826 --> 0:19:59,209
ALL: Doesn't bury our!


520
0:19:59,209 --> 0:20:0,445
FEMALE SPEAKER: Our beauty!


521
0:20:0,445 --> 0:20:0,86
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]


522
0:20:0,86 --> 0:20:1,8
ALL: Our beauty!


523
0:20:1,8 --> 0:20:2,27
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, my God.


524
0:20:2,27 --> 0:20:3,68
Give yourselves a thundering,
thunder,


525
0:20:3,68 --> 0:20:5,56
thunderous round of applause.


526
0:20:5,56 --> 0:20:6,5
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]


527
0:20:6,5 --> 0:20:8,9
FEMALE SPEAKER: Love and
kisses to you all.


528
0:20:8,9 --> 0:20:9,2
Enjoy yourself.


529
0:20:9,2 --> 0:20:12,59
And have a blessed, blessed
Full Figured Fashion Week.


530
0:20:12,59 --> 0:20:15,45

[MUSIC PLAYING]


532
0:20:31,77 --> 0:20:34,44
CHARLOT DUBOC: As Shonda said,
Full Figured Fashion Week was


533
0:20:34,44 --> 0:20:37,4
about much more than
just fashion.


534
0:20:37,4 --> 0:20:39,64
I've been welcomed into the
bosom of what felt more like a


535
0:20:39,64 --> 0:20:41,852
sisterhood than a
fashion crowd.


536
0:20:41,852 --> 0:20:44,71
First, no one's denying that
it's everybody's right to feel


537
0:20:44,71 --> 0:20:47,9
and look good, the question of
size and health remains a


538
0:20:47,9 --> 0:20:51,24
massively divisive topic
in western society.


539
0:20:51,24 --> 0:20:54,26
But at that moment, on that
boat, at one of the best


540
0:20:54,26 --> 0:20:57,64
fashion parties I've ever been
to, I felt pretty convinced


541
0:20:57,64 --> 0:20:59,772
that bigger is definitely
better.


542
0:20:59,772 --> 0:21:8,39
[MUSIC PLAYING]


543
0:21:8,39 --> 0:21:11,39
FEMALE SPEAKER: A big
cake for a big girl.


544
0:21:11,39 --> 0:21:13,39
Fab, full figured is in.
