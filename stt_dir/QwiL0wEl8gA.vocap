###31 Deadly riots over the government's
###34 plan to avoid defaulting on its loans...
###36 is that the unemployment keeps
###38 rising and it has to keep rising
###40 just because we have an excess supply of goods...
###44 this is all borrowed money...
###46 and that debt is owned by banks in other countries...
###50 M-O-N-E-Y, in the form of a convenient personal loan...
###55 ... filter cigarette that delivers the taste...
###57 45 malt liquor... Are You Hot?!...
###60 is the US planning to bomb Iran?...

###67 Now, my grandmother was a wonderful person.
###70 She taught me how to play the game Monopoly.
###73 She understood that the name of the game is to acquire.
###77 She would accumulate everything she could and
###79 eventually, she became the master of the board.
###83 And then she would always say the same thing to me.
###84 She would look at me and she would say:
###87 “One day, you'll learn to play the game.”
###90 One summer I played Monopoly almost every day, all day long
###94 and that summer, I learned to play the game.
###97 I came to understand that the only way to win
###99 is to make a total commitment to acquisition.
###102 I came to understand that money and possessions...
###104 that's the way that you keep score.
###108 And by the end of that summer
###109 I was more ruthless than my grandmother.
###111 I was ready to bend the rules if I had to, to win that game...
###115 and I sat down with her to play that fall.
###119 I took everything she had. I watched her
###121 give her last dollar and quit in utter defeat.
###126 And then she had one more thing to teach me.
###130 Then she said:
###134 “Now it all goes back in the box.
###140 All those houses and hotels.
###143 All the railroads and utility companies...
###145 All that property and all that wonderful money...
###150 Now it all goes back in the box.
###154 None of it was really yours.
###158 You got all heated up about it for a while.
###161 But it was around a long time before you sat down at the board
###165 and it will be here after you're gone - players come - players go.
###172 Houses and cars...
###175 Titles and clothes...
###177 Even your body.”
###180 Because the fact is that everything I clutch and consume and hoard
###184 is going to go back in the box and I'm going to lose it all.
###187 So you have to ask yourself
###189 when you finally get the ultimate promotion
###191 when you have made the ultimate purchase
###193 when you buy the ultimate home
###195 when you have stored up financial security
###197 and climbed the ladder of success to the
###199 highest rung you can possibly climb it...
###203 and the thrill wears off
###205 - and it will wear off -
###209 Then what?
###212 How far do you have to walk down that road
###214 before you see where it leads?
###219 Surely you understand
###222 it will never be enough.
###225 So you have to ask yourself the question:
###228 What matters?
###289 They're Hot!
###292 They're Rich!
###296 And They're Spoiled!

###355 When I was a young man
###357 growing up in New York City
###360 I refused to pledge allegiance to the flag.
###365 Of course I was sent to the principal's office.
###368 And he asked me 'Why don't you want to Pledge Allegiance?
###371 Everybody does!'
###373 I said, 'Everybody once believed the earth was flat
###376 but that doesn't make it so.'
###378 I explained that America owed everything it has
###381 to other cultures
###383 and other nations
###384 and that I would rather pledge allegiance
###386 to the earth
###387 and everyone on it.
###390 Needless to say, it wasn't long
###392 before I left school entirely
###395 and I set up a lab in my bedroom.
###398 There I began to learn about science
###401 and nature.
###402 I realized then
###404 that the universe is governed by laws
###406 and that the human being
###408 along with society itself
###409 was not exempt from these laws.
###413 Then came the crash of 1929.
###416 Which began what we now call
###419 “The Great Depression”.
###420 I found it difficult to understand why millions
###424 were out of work, homeless, starving
###427 while all the factories were sitting there.
###430 The resources were unchanged.
###432 It was then that I realized
###435 that the rules of the economic game
###438 were inherently invalid.
###441 Shortly after came World War II
###444 where various nations took turns
###446 systematically destroying each other.
###449 I later calculated that all the destruction
###452 and wasted resources
###454 spent on that war
###456 could have easily provided for every
###458 human need on the planet.
###463 Since that time I have watched humanity
###466 set the stage for its own extinction.
###470 I have watched as the precious finite resources
###473 are perpetually wasted and destroyed
###476 in the name of profit and free-markets.
###479 I have watched the social values of society be reduced
###483 into a base artificiality of materialism
###486 and mindless consumption.
###489 And I have watched as the monetary powers
###493 control the political structure
###495 of supposedly free societies.
###499 I'm 94 years old now.
###502 And I'm afraid my disposition
###504 is the same as it was
###506 75 years ago.
###510 This shit's got to go.
###517 [ZEITGEIST]
###525 [ZEITGEIST: MOVING FORWARD]
###540 [Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful
###543 committed citizens can change the world.
###545 Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.
###547 -Margaret Mead]
###550 Part 1: Human Nature
###553 So you're a scientist
###555 and somewhere along the way, hammered into your head
###559 is the inevitable “nature versus nurture”
###562 and that's at least up there with Coke versus Pepsi
###565 or Greeks versus Trojans.
###567 So, nature versus nurture: This, by now
###570 utterly over-simplifying view of
###573 where influences are
###575 influences how a cell deals with
###580 an energy crisis up to
###582 what makes us who we are on the most individualistic
###585 levels of personality.
###587 And what you've got is this complete false dichotomy
###590 built around nature as deterministic
###594 at the very bottom of all the causality.
###597 Life is DNA and the code of codes
###600 and the Holy Grail, and everything is driven by it....
###603 At the other end is a much more
###605 social science perspective which is
###607 We are 'social organisms'
###609 and biology is for slime molds.
###613 Humans are free of biology
###615 and obviously both views are nonsense.
###618 What you see instead is that
###620 it is virtually impossible to understand
###623 how biology works
###625 outside of the context of environment.
###628 [It's Genetic]
###630 One of the most crazy making
###633 yet widespread and
###635 potentially dangerous notions is:
###638 “Oh, that behavior is genetic”.
###642 Now what does that mean?
###643 It means all sorts of subtle stuff if you
###646 know modern biology, but for most people
###648 out there, what it winds-up meaning is:
###651 a deterministic view of life;
###654 one rooted in biology and genetics;
###657 genes equal things that cannot be changed;
###660 genes equal things that are
###663 inevitable and you might as well not
###665 waste resources trying to fix;
###668 might as well not put societal energies into trying
###671 to improve because it's inevitable and it's unchangeable...
###674 and that is sheer nonsense.
###680 [Disease]
###683 It is widely thought that conditions like
###686 ADHD are genetically programmed
###689 That conditions like schizophrenia are genetically programmed.
###691 The truth is the opposite.
###693 Nothing is genetically programmed.
###694 There are very rare diseases
###697 a small handful
###698 extremely sparsely represented in the population
###702 that are truly genetically determined.
###706 Most complex conditions
###708 might have a predisposition that has a genetic component
###712 but a predisposition is not the same as a predetermination.
###716 The whole search for the source of diseases in the genome
###720 was doomed to failure before anybody even thought of it
###723 because most diseases are not genetically predetermined.
###727 Heart disease, cancers, strokes
###730 rheumatoid conditions, autoimmune conditions in general
###736 mental health conditions, addictions...
###738 none of them are genetically determined.
###741 Breast cancer, for example, out of 100 women with breast cancer
###745 only seven will carry the breast cancer genes.
###748 93 do not
###750 and out of 100 women who do have the genes
###752 not all of them will get cancer.
###757 [Behavior]
###759 Genes are not just things that make us behave
###762 in a particular way regardless of our environment.
###767 Genes give us different ways of responding to our environment.
###770 And, in fact, it looks as if some of the early
###775 childhood influences and the kind of child rearing
###779 affect gene expression
###781 actually turning on or off different genes
###784 to put you on a different developmental track
###788 which may suit the kind of world you've got to deal with.
###792 So for example.
###793 A study done in Montreal with suicide victims
###798 looked at autopsies of the brains of these people
###801 and it turned out that if a suicide victim
###804 (these are usually young adults)
###806 had been abused as a child, the abuse actually
###809 caused a genetic change in the brain
###812 that was absent in the brains of people who had not been abused.
###817 That's an epigenetic effect.
###818 “epi” means on top of, so that
###821 the epigenetic influence is what happens
###825 environmentally to either activate or deactivate certain genes.
###831 In New Zealand, there was a study
###833 that was done in a town called Dunedin
###836 in which a few thousand individuals
###840 were studied from birth into their 20s.
###845 What they found was that they could identify
###851 a genetic mutation, an abnormal gene
###854 which did have some relation to
###857 the predisposition to commit violence
###861 but only if the individual had also
###864 been subjected to severe child abuse.
###868 In other words, children with this abnormal gene would
###871 be no more likely to be violent than anybody else
###874 and, in fact, they actually had a lower rate of violence
###877 than people with normal genes
###879 as long as they weren't abused as children.
###883 Great additional example of the ways
###885 in which genes are not “be all - end all”.
###887 A fancy technique where you can
###889 take a specific gene out of a mouse
###892 and that mouse and its descendants will not have that gene.
###894 You have ”knocked out” that gene.
###896 So there's this one gene that encodes
###898 for a protein that has something to do
###899 with learning and memory and with this fabulous demonstration-
###904 you “knock out” that gene and you
###905 have a mouse that doesn't learn as well.
###907 “Oh! A genetic basis for intelligence!”
###910 What was much less appreciated in that landmark study
###913 that got picked up by the media left and right
###916 is take those genetically impaired mice
###919 and raise them in a much more enriched
###921 stimulating environment than your normal mice in a lab cage
###924 and they completely overcame that deficit.
###927 So, when one says in a contemporary sense that
###932 “oh, this behavior is genetic”
###935 to the extent that that's even a valid sort of phrase to use
###938 what you're saying is: there is a
###941 genetic contribution to how this
###943 organism responds to environment;
###945 genes may influence the
###948 readiness with which an organism will
###950 deal with a certain environmental challenge.
###953 You know, that's not the version most people have in their minds
###956 and not to be too 'soap-boxing'
###959 but run with the old
###962 version of “It's genetic!”
###964 and it's not that far from the history of eugenics
###967 and things of that sort.
###969 It's a widespread misconception
###971 and it's a potentially fairly dangerous one.
###974 One reason that the
###977 biological explanation for violence...
###980 one reason that hypothesis is
###983 potentially dangerous, it's not just misleading
###985 it can really do harm...
###988 is because if you believe that
###991 you could very easily say:
###993 “Well, there's nothing we can do
###995 to change the predisposition
###997 people have to becoming violent;
###999 all we can do is punish them - lock them up
###1004 or execute them
###1005 but we don't need to worry about changing the
###1008 social environment or the social preconditions
###1012 that may lead people to become violent because
###1016 that's irrelevant'.”
###1018 The genetic argument allows us the luxury of ignoring
###1022 past and present historical and social factors
###1025 and in the words of Louis Menand
###1028 who wrote in the New Yorker
###1030 Very astutely, he said:
###1031 “it's all in the genes... an explanation for the way things are
###1035 that does not threaten the way things are.
###1038 Why should someone feel unhappy
###1040 or engage in antisocial behavior
###1043 when that person is living in the
###1045 freest and most prosperous nation on Earth?
###1048 It can't be the system.
###1050 There must be a flaw in the wiring somewhere.”
###1053 Which is a good way of putting it.
###1055 So, the genetic argument is simply a cop-out
###1059 which allows us to ignore
###1061 the social and economic and political factors
###1064 that, in fact, underlie
###1067 many troublesome behaviors.
###1073 [Case Study: Addiction]
###1075 Addictions are usually
###1077 considered to be a drug-related issue
###1079 but looking at it more broadly
###1081 I define addiction as any behavior
###1084 that is associated with craving
###1087 with temporary relief
###1089 and with long-term negative consequences
###1091 along with an impairment of control over it so that the person
###1095 wishes to give it up or promises to do so
###1098 but can't follow through
###1100 and when you understand that, you see that
###1103 there are many more addictions
###1104 than simply those related to drugs.
###1106 There's workaholism; addiction to shopping;
###1108 to the Internet; to video games...
###1110 There's the addiction to power. People that have power but they
###1113 want more and more; nothing is ever enough for them.
###1116 Acquisition - corporations that must own more and more.
###1120 The addiction to oil
###1122 or at least to the wealth and to the products made
###1124 accessible to us by oil.
###1127 Look at the negative consequences on the environment.
###1130 We are destroying the very earth that we
###1132 inhabit for the sake of that addiction.
###1135 Now, these addictions are far more
###1137 devastating in their social consequences
###1139 than the cocaine or heroin habits of my downtown Eastside patients.
###1144 Yet, they are rewarded and considered to be respectable.
###1148 The tobacco company executive that shows a higher profit
###1151 will get a much bigger reward.
###1154 He doesn't face any negative consequences legally or otherwise.
###1159 In fact he is a respected member of
###1161 the board of several other corporations.
###1164 But, tobacco smoke related diseases
###1167 kill 5 ½ million people around the world every year.
###1171 In the United States they kill 400,000 people a year.
###1175 And these people are addicted to what? To profit.
###1177 To such a degree that they are addicted
###1179 that they are actually in denial
###1182 about the impact of their activities
###1184 which is typical for addicts, this denial.
###1187 And that's a respectable one. It's respectable
###1190 to be addicted to profit, no matter what the cost.
###1192 So, what is acceptable and what is respectable
###1196 is a highly arbitrary phenomenon in our society
###1199 and it seems like the greater the harm
###1200 the more respectable the addiction.
###1205 [The Myth]
###1207 There is a general myth that drugs, in themselves, are addictive.
###1210 In fact, the war on drugs is predicated on the
###1213 idea that if you interdict the source of
###1215 drugs you can deal with addiction that way.
###1218 Now, if you understand addiction in the broader sense
###1221 we see that nothing in itself is addictive.
###1224 No substance, no drug is by itself addictive
###1227 and no behavior is by itself addictive.
###1229 Many people can go shopping without becoming shopaholics.
###1232 Not everyone becomes a food addict.
###1234 Not everyone who drinks a glass of wine becomes an alcoholic.
###1237 So the real issue is what makes people susceptible
###1240 because it's the combination of a susceptible individual
###1244 and the potentially addictive substance or behavior
###1247 that makes for the full flowering of addiction.
###1251 In short, it's not the drug that's addictive
###1254 it's the question of the susceptibility of the individual
###1257 to being addicted to a particular substance or behavior.
###1261 [Environment]
###1262 If we wish to understand what
###1264 then makes some people susceptible
###1266 we actually have to look at the life experience.
###1268 The old idea, although it's old but it's still
###1274 broadly held, that addictions are due to some genetic cause
###1277 is simply scientifically untenable.
###1280 What the case is actually is that certain life experiences
###1283 make people susceptible.
###1285 Life experiences that not only shape the person's
###1289 personality and psychological needs
###1293 but also their very brains in certain ways.
###1296 And that process begins in utero.
###1301 [Prenatal]
###1303 It has been shown, for example
###1304 that if you stress mothers during pregnancy
###1308 their children are more likely to have
###1310 traits that predispose them to addictions
###1312 and that's because development is shaped
###1315 by the psychological and social environment.
###1317 So the biology of human beings is very much affected by
###1321 and programmed by the life experiences beginning in utero.
###1326 Environment does not begin at birth.
###1328 Environment begins as soon as you have an environment.
###1331 As soon as you are a fetus, you are subject to whatever
###1334 information is coming through mom's circulations.
###1337 Hormones, levels of nutrients...
###1339 A great landmark example of this is
###1341 something called the Dutch Hongerwinter.
###1344 In 1944, Nazis occupying Holland
###1348 for a bunch of reasons, they decide to
###1350 take all the food and divert it to Germany;
###1352 for three months everybody there was starving.
###1354 Tens of thousands of people starve to death.
###1356 What the Dutch hunger winter effect is:
###1358 if you were a second or third trimester fetus during the starvation
###1363 your body 'learned' something very unique during that time.
###1367 As it turns out, second and third trimester is when your body is
###1371 going about trying to learn about the environment:
###1373 How menacing of a place is it out there?
###1377 How plentiful? How much nutrients am I getting
###1380 by way of mom's circulation?
###1382 Be a fetus who was starving during that time and your body
###1386 programs forever after to be
###1389 really, really stingy with your sugar and fat and
###1393 what you do is you store every bit of it.
###1396 Be a Dutch Hunger Winter fetus and half a century later
###1399 everything else being equal
###1401 you are more likely to have high blood pressure
###1404 obesity or metabolic syndrome.
###1406 That is environment coming in a very unexpected place.
###1410 You can stress animals in the laboratory when they're pregnant
###1414 and their offspring will be more
###1415 likely to use cocaine and alcohol as adults.
###1418 You can stress human mothers. For example, in a British study
###1421 women who were abused in pregnancy
###1424 will have higher levels of
###1426 the stress hormone cortisol in their placenta at birth
###1429 and their children are more likely to have conditions that
###1432 predispose them to addictions by age 7 or 8.
###1435 So in utero stress already prepares the gun
###1438 for all kinds of mental health issues.
###1440 An Israeli study done on children
###1444 born to mothers who were pregnant
###1447 prior to the onset of the 1967 war...
###1452 These women, of course, were very stressed
###1454 and their offspring have a higher incidence of schizophrenia
###1456 than the average cohort.
###1458 So, there is plenty of evidence now that prenatal
###1462 effects have a huge impact on the developing human being.
###1468 [Infancy]
###1470 The point about human development and
###1471 specifically human brain development
###1473 is that it occurs mostly under the impact of the environment
###1475 and mostly after birth.
###1477 Now, if you compare us to a horse
###1479 which can run on the first day of life
###1481 we see that we are very undeveloped.
###1485 We can't muster that much neurological coordination
###1489 balance, muscle strength, visual acuity
###1492 until a year and a half, two years of age.
###1494 That's because the brain development in the horse
###1496 happens in the safety of the womb
###1498 and in the human being, it has to happen after birth
###1501 and that has to do with simple evolutionary logic.
###1504 As the head gets larger, which is what makes us into human beings
###1508 the burgeoning of the forebrain is
###1511 what creates the human species, actually.
###1513 At the same time, we walk on two legs. So, our pelvis narrows
###1516 to accommodate that. So now we
###1518 have a narrower pelvis, a larger head
###1520 Bingo! We have to be born prematurely.
###1522 And that means the brain development that in other animals
###1525 occurs in utero
###1526 in us, occurs after birth
###1528 and much of that under the impact of the environment.
###1530 The concept of Neural Darwinism simply means
###1535 that the circuits that get the appropriate input from the environment
###1538 will develop optimally and the ones that don't
###1540 will either not develop optimally or perhaps not at all.
###1543 If you take a child with perfectly good eyes at birth
###1546 and you put him in a dark room for five years
###1548 he will be blind thereafter for the rest of his life
###1551 because the circuits of vision require light waves for their development
###1555 and without that even the rudimentary
###1557 circuit's present and active at birth
###1560 will atrophy and die and new ones will not develop.
###1566 [Memory]
###1567 There is a significant way in which
###1570 early experiences shape adult behavior
###1576 and even and especially early
###1578 experiences for which there is no recall memory.
###1581 It turns out that there are two kinds of memory:
###1584 there is explicit memory which is recall
###1586 this is when you can call back facts
###1589 details, episodes, circumstances.
###1592 But the structure in the brain which is called the hippocampus
###1595 which encodes recall memory
###1597 doesn't even begin to develop fully until a year and a half
###1600 and it is not fully developed until much later.
###1602 Which is why hardly anybody has
###1604 any recall memory prior to 18 months.
###1607 But there is another kind of
###1608 memory which is called implicit memory
###1609 which is, in fact, an emotional memory
###1612 where the emotional impact and the interpretation the child makes
###1616 of those emotional experiences are ingrained in the brain
###1619 in the form of nerve circuits ready to fire
###1621 without specific recall.
###1623 So to give you a clear example
###1625 people who are adopted have a
###1627 lifelong sense of rejection very often.
###1629 They can't recall the adoption.
###1631 They can't recall the separation of the birth mother
###1633 because there's nothing there to recall with.
###1635 But the emotional memory of separation and rejection
###1638 is deeply embedded in their brains.
###1640 Hence, they are much more likely
###1642 to experience a sense of rejection
###1644 and a great emotional upset
###1646 when they perceive themselves as being rejected
###1649 by other people.
###1650 That's not unique to people who are
###1651 adopted but it is particularly strong in them
###1653 because of this function of implicit memory.
###1656 People who are addicted, given all the
###1659 research literature and in my experience
###1662 the hard-core addicts virtually were all
###1667 significantly abused as children
###1669 or suffered severe emotional loss.
###1671 Their emotional or implicit memories
###1674 are those of a world that's not safe
###1676 and not helpful; caregivers who were not to be trusted
###1680 and relationships that are not
###1683 safe enough to open up to vulnerability
###1686 and hence their responses tend
###1687 to be to keep themselves separate from
###1689 really intimate relationships;
###1691 not to trust caregivers
###1694 doctors and other people who are trying to help them
###1697 and generally see the world as an unsafe place...
###1700 and that is strictly a function of implicit memory
###1704 which sometimes has to do with incidents they don't even recall.
###1712 [Touch]
###1714 Infants who are born premature or often in incubators
###1716 and various types of gadgetry and
###1719 machinery for weeks and perhaps months,
###1722 it's now known that if these
###1723 children are touched and stroked on the back
###1726 for just 10 minutes a day that promotes their brain development.
###1729 So, human touch is essential for development
###1732 and, in fact, infants who are never picked up will actually die.
###1736 That is how much of a fundamental
###1738 need being held is to human beings.
###1741 In our society, there is an unfortunate tendency
###1744 to tell parents not to pick up their kids, not to hold them
###1747 not to pick up babies who are crying for fear of spoiling them
###1752 or to encourage them to sleep through the night
###1755 you don't pick them up...
###1756 which is just the opposite of what the child needs
###1758 and these children might go back to sleep because they give up
###1762 and their brains just shut down as a
###1764 way of defending against the vulnerability
###1767 of being abandoned really by their parents
###1769 but their implicit memories will be
###1771 that of the world that doesn't give a damn.
###1775 [Childhood]
###1777 A lot of these differences are structured very early in life.
###1782 In a way, the parental experience of adversity
###1788 how tough life is or how easy it is
###1791 is passed on to children
###1792 whether through maternal depression
###1795 or parents being bad tempered with
###1796 their kids because they have had a hard day
###1798 or just being too tired at the end of the day...
###1802 and these have very powerful effects programming
###1806 children's development, which we know a lot about now
###1809 But that early sensitivity isn't just an evolutionary mistake.
###1814 It exists again in many different species.
###1817 Even in seedlings there's an early adaptive process
###1820 to the kind of environment they are growing up in
###1822 but for humans, the adaptation is to the quality of social relations.
###1828 And so, early life:
###1831 how nurturing, how much conflict, how much attention you get
###1835 is a taster of the kind of world you may be growing up in.
###1840 Are you growing up in a world where
###1841 you have to fight for what you can get;
###1843 watch your back; fend for yourself; learn not to trust others?...
###1847 or are you growing up in a society where you depend on
###1850 reciprocity, mutuality, cooperation, where empathy is important
###1855 where your security depends on good relations with other people?...
###1859 and that needs a very different
###1861 emotional and cognitive development
###1863 and that's what the early sensitivity is about
###1866 and parenting is almost, quite unconsciously
###1870 a system for passing on that experience to children...
###1873 of the kind of world they are in.
###1876 The great British child psychiatrist, DW Winnicott, said
###1880 that fundamentally, two things can go wrong in childhood.
###1883 One is when things happen that shouldn't happen
###1886 and then things that should happen but don't.
###1889 In the first category, is the dramatic, abusive
###1893 and abandonment experiences of my
###1896 downtown Eastside patients and of many addicts.
###1899 That's what shouldn't happen but did.
###1902 But then there is the non-stressed
###1906 attuned, non-distracted attention
###1908 of the parent that every child needs
###1911 that very often children don't get.
###1913 They're not abused. They are not neglected
###1915 and they're not traumatized
###1918 but what should happen
###1919 the presence of the emotionally available nurturing parent
###1922 just is not available to them because of the
###1925 stresses in our society and the parenting environment.
###1927 The psychologist Allan Surer calls that "Proximal Abandonment"
###1934 when the parent is physically present
###1937 but emotionally absent.
###1940 I have spent...
###1943 roughly the last 40 years of my life
###1947 working with the most violent of people our society produces:
###1951 murderers, rapists and so on.
###1954 In an attempt to understand what causes this violence.
###1958 I discovered that the most violent of the criminals in our prisons
###1962 had themselves been victims
###1965 of a degree of child abuse that was beyond the scale of
###1968 what I ever thought of applying the term child abuse to.
###1971 I had no idea of the depth
###1974 of the depravity with which children in our society
###1978 are all too often treated.
###1980 The most violent people I saw were themselves the survivors
###1984 of their own attempted murder often at the hands of their parents
###1987 or other people in their social environment
###1991 or were the survivors of family members who had been killed
###1994 their closest family members, by other people.
###1999 The Buddha argued that everything depends on everything else.
###2003 He says 'the one contains the many and the many contains the one'.
###2006 That you can't understand anything in isolation from its environment.
###2010 The leaf contains the sun, the sky and the earth, obviously.
###2018 This has now been shown to be true, of course
###2021 all around and specifically when it comes to human development.
###2024 The modern scientific term for it
###2026 is the "bio psycho social" nature of human development
###2029 which says that the biology of human beings
###2032 depends very much on their interaction with
###2034 the social and psychological environment.
###2036 Specifically, the psychiatrist and researcher
###2042 Daniel Siegel at the University of California, Los Angeles, UCLA
###2046 has coined a phrase “Interpersonal Neurobiology”
###2050 which means to say that the way
###2052 that our nervous system functions
###2054 depends very much on our personal relationships.
###2057 In the first place with the parenting caregivers and in the
###2060 second place with other important attachment figures in our lives
###2063 and in the third-place, with our entire culture.
###2066 So that you can't separate the
###2068 neurological functioning of a human being
###2071 from the environment in which he or she grew up in
###2075 and continues to exist in
###2077 and this is true throughout the lifecycle.
###2080 It's particularly true when you are
###2082 dependent and helpless when your brain is developing
###2084 but it's true even in adults and even at the end of life.
###2091 [Culture]
###2093 Human beings have lived in almost every kind of society.
###2096 From the most egalitarian... hunting and gathering societies
###2101 seem to have been very egalitarian
###2103 for instance, based on food sharing, gift exchange...
###2106 Small bands of people living predominately
###2109 off of foraging and a little bit of hunting
###2113 predominantly among people you have
###2115 at the least, known your entire life
###2117 if not surrounded by third cousins or closer;
###2120 in a world in which there is a great
###2122 deal of fluidity between different groups;
###2124 in a world which there is not a
###2126 whole lot in terms of material culture...
###2128 this is how humans have spent most of their hominid history.
###2131 And no surprise, that makes for a very different world.
###2134 One of the things you get as a result of that is far less violence.
###2138 Organized group violence is not
###2141 something that occurred at that time
###2143 of human history and that seems quite clear.
###2146 So where did we go wrong?
###2150 Violence is not universal.
###2154 It is not symmetrically distributed throughout the human race.
###2158 There is a huge variation in the amount of violence in different societies.
###2163 There are some societies that have virtually no violence.
###2167 There are others that destroy themselves.
###2170 Some of the Anabaptist religious
###2174 groups that are complete strict pacifists
###2178 like the Amish, the Mennonites, the Hutterites...
###2181 among some of these groups, the Hutterites
###2184 there are no recorded cases of homicide.
###2189 During our major wars, like World War II
###2192 where people were being drafted
###2194 they would refuse to serve in the military.
###2196 They would go to prison rather than serve in the military
###2200 In the Kibbutzim in Israel
###2202 the level of violence is so low that the criminal courts there
###2205 will often send violent offenders
###2208 people who have committed crimes
###2211 to live on the Kibbutzim in order to
###2214 learn how to live a non-violent life...
###2216 because that's the way people live there.
###2218 So, we are amply shaped by society.
###2222 Our societies, in the broader sense including our theological
###2227 our metaphysical, our linguistic influences, etc.
###2231 our societies help shape us as to whether or not we think
###2234 life is basically about sin or about beauty;
###2238 whether the afterlife will carry a price for
###2240 how we live our lives or if it's irrelevant.
###2243 In a broad sort of way different large societies could
###2247 be termed as individualistic or
###2249 collectivist and you get very different people
###2252 and different mindsets and I suspect
###2253 different brains coming along with that.
###2255 We, in America, are in one of the most individualistic of societies.
###2260 With capitalism being a system that allows you to go
###2263 higher and higher up a potential pyramid and
###2267 the deal is that it comes with fewer and fewer safety nets.
###2270 By definition, the more stratified a society is
###2274 the fewer people you have as peers - the fewer people with whom
###2277 you have symmetrical, reciprocal relationships -
###2280 and instead, all you have are differing spots and endless hierarchies...
###2285 A world in which you have few reciprocal partners
###2288 is a world with a lot less altruism.
###2294 [Human Nature]
###2297 So, this brings us to a total impossible juncture which is
###2302 to try to make sense in perspective science...
###2305 as to what that nature is of human nature.
###2308 You know, on a certain level
###2310 the nature of our nature is not to be
###2313 particularly constrained by our nature.
###2316 We come up with more social
###2317 variability than any species out there.
###2320 More systems of belief, of styles of family structures
###2324 of ways of raising children. The capacity
###2327 for variety that we have is extraordinary.
###2331 In a society which is predicated on competition
###2335 and really, very often, the ruthless exploitation
###2341 of one human being by another
###2343 the profiteering off of other people's problems
###2346 and very often the creation of
###2348 problems for the purpose of profiteering
###2351 the ruling ideology will very often justify that behavior
###2354 by appeals to some fundamental and unalterable human nature.
###2359 So the myth in our society is
###2360 that people are competitive by nature
###2362 and that they are individualistic and that they're selfish.
###2367 The real reality is quite the opposite.
###2370 We have certain human needs.
###2371 The only way that you can talk about human nature concretely
###2374 is by recognizing that there are certain human needs.
###2377 We have a human need for companionship and for close contact
###2380 to be loved, to be attached to, to be accepted
###2383 to be seen, to be received for who we are.
###2387 If those needs are met, we develop
###2390 into people who are compassionate
###2392 and cooperative and who have empathy for other people.
###2398 So...
###2401 the opposite, that we often see in our
###2403 society is, in fact, a distortion of human nature
###2405 precisely because so few people have their needs met.
###2409 So, yes you can talk about human nature
###2411 but only in the sense of basic human needs
###2414 that are instinctively evoked
###2416 or I should say, certain human needs
###2418 that lead to certain traits if they are met
###2421 and a different set of traits if they are denied.
###2427 So...
###2428 when we recognize the fact that the human organism
###2431 which has a great deal of adaptive flexibility
###2434 allowing us to survive in many different conditions
###2437 is also rigidly programmed for certain environmental requirements
###2442 or human needs
###2444 a social imperative begins to emerge.
###2447 Just as our bodies require physical nutrients
###2450 the human brain demands positive forms of environmental stimulus
###2455 at all stages of development
###2457 while also needing to be protected
###2460 from other negative forms of stimulus.
###2463 And if things that should happen, do not...
###2465 or if things that shouldn't happen, do...
###2468 it is now apparent that the door can be opened for not only
###2471 a cascade of mental and physical diseases
###2474 but many detrimental human behaviors as well.
###2478 So, as we turn our perspective now outward
###2481 and take account for the state of affairs today
###2483 we must ask the question:
###2486 Is the condition we have created in the modern world
###2488 actually supporting our health?
###2491 Is the bedrock of our socioeconomic
###2494 system acting as a positive force
###2496 for human and social development and progress?
###2500 Or, is the foundational gravitation of our society
###2504 actually going against the core evolutionary requirements
###2508 needed to create and maintain
###2511 our personal and social well-being?
###2531 [Part II: Social Pathology]
###2537 So, one might ask where did this all begin?
###2541 What we have today... really a world in a state of
###2544 cumulative collapse.
###2547 [The Market]
###2550 You get it started with John Locke.
###2553 And John Locke introduces property.
###2556 He has three provisos for just private right and property.
###2560 And the three provisos are:
###2562 There must be enough left over for others
###2565 and that you must not let it spoil
###2567 and that you, most of all, must mix your labor with it.
###2571 It seems justified- you mix your labor with the world
###2574 then you are entitled to the product
###2576 and as long as there's enough left over for others
###2579 and as long as it doesn't spoil
###2581 and you don't allow anything to go to waste then that's okay.
###2584 He spends a long time on this and his famous treatise of government
###2587 and it's since been the canonical text
###2590 for economic and political and legal understanding.
###2593 It is still the classic text that's studied.
###2596 Well - after he gives the provisos
###2600 and you're almost thinking at the time whether you
###2602 are for private property or not
###2603 he has given a very good plausible and powerful defense
###2608 of private property here...
###2609 Well, he drops them!
###2611 He drops them like that. Right in one sentence.
###2613 He says, 'Well, once the introduction
###2615 of money came in by men's tacit consent
###2618 then it became...'
###2620 and he doesn't say all the provisos are canceled or erased-
###2623 but that's what happens.
###2626 So, now we have not
###2628 product and your property earned by your own labor-
###2630 oh no- money buys labor now.
###2633 There is no longer consideration
###2635 whether there is enough left over for others;
###2637 there is no longer consideration of whether it spoils
###2640 because he says money is like
###2641 silver and gold and gold can't spoil
###2643 and therefore money can't be responsible for waste...
###2647 which is ridiculous. We are not talking about money
###2649 and silver, we are talking about what its effects are.
###2651 It's one non sequitur after another.
###2654 Just the most startling
###2657 logical legerdemain that he gets away with here
###2661 but it fits the interests of capital owners.
###2666 Then Adam Smith comes along and what he adds
###2668 is the religion to this...
###2670 Locke started with God made it all this way
###2673 this is God's right
###2674 and now we get also with Smith
###2676 saying 'it's not only God's...'
###2679 well, he's not actually saying this but
###2680 this is what's happening philosophically, in principle
###2683 he's saying that 'it is not only a question of private property...'
###2686 That's all now 'presupposed'- It's Given!
###2689 And that there's 'money investors that buy labor' – Given!
###2691 There's no limit to how much they can buy of other men's labor
###2695 how much they can accumulate, how much 'inequality'-
###2697 that's all given now.
###2699 And so he comes along and what his big idea is
###2702 and again it's just introduced in parentheses, in passing...
###2707 You know, when people put out goods for sale - the supply
###2710 and other people buy them - the demand and so forth
###2715 how do we have supply equaling demand
###2719 or demand equaling supply?
###2721 how can they come into equilibrium?
###2723 and that is one of the central notions of economics
###2725 is how do they come into equilibrium...
###2728 and he says: it's the “Invisible Hand of the Market”
###2732 that brings them into equilibrium.
###2734 So, now we have "God is actually imminent”.
###2737 He just didn't give the rights to property
###2741 and all its wherewithal and its "natural rights"
###2745 regarding what Locke said...
###2747 now we have the system itself as "God".
###2751 In fact, Smith says, when he talks
###2755 and you have to read the whole of the
###2757 Wealth of Nations' to find this quote.
###2759 He says: 'the scantiness of subsistence
###2762 sets limits to the reproduction of the poor
###2766 and that nature can deal with this in no other way
###2771 than elimination of their children.'
###2774 So he anticipated evolutionary theory in the worst sense...
###2779 this is well before Darwin.
###2780 And so he called them the 'Race of Laborers'.
###2783 So you can see: there was inherent racism built-in here
###2787 there was an inherent life blindness to kill
###2792 innumerable children
###2794 and he thought: 'that's the Invisible Hand making supply
###2797 meet demand and demand meet supply.'
###2800 So, see how wise "God" is?
###2803 So you can see a lot of the really virulent
###2806 life destructive, eco-genocidal things
###2810 that are going on now have, in a way,
###2814 a 'thought gene' back in Smith too.
###2820 When we reflect on the original concept of
###2822 the so-called free market - capitalist system
###2825 as initiated by early economic philosophers
###2828 such as Adam Smith
###2829 we see that the original intent of a “market”
###2832 was based around real, tangible, life supporting goods for trade.
###2837 Adam Smith never fathomed that the most
###2839 profitable economic sector on the planet
###2842 would eventually be in the arena of financial trading
###2845 or so-called investment
###2847 where money itself is simply
###2848 gained by the movement of other money
###2850 in an arbitrary game which holds
###2853 zero productive merit to society.
###2855 Yet, regardless of Smith's intent
###2858 the door for such seemingly anomalous advents
###2860 was left wide open by one fundamental tenet of this theory:
###2865 Money is treated as a Commodity, in and of itself.
###2870 Today, in every economy of the world
###2872 regardless of the social system they claim
###2874 money is pursued for the sake of money and nothing else.
###2878 The underlying idea, which was mysteriously qualified
###2881 by Adam Smith with his religious declaration of the
###2885 'Invisible Hand'
###2887 is that the narrow, self-interested pursuit
###2890 of this fictional commodity
###2892 will somehow magically manifest
###2894 human and social well-being and progress.
###2898 The reality is that the monetary incentive interest
###2902 or what some have termed the:“Money Sequence of Value”
###2906 has now completely decoupled from the foundational
###2909 'life interest', which could be termed the
###2912 'Life Sequence of Value.'
###2914 What has happened is that there is a complete confusion
###2918 in economic doctrine
###2920 between those two sequences.
###2922 They think that the Money Sequence of Value
###2924 delivers the Life Sequence of Value
###2927 and that's why they say if more goods are sold
###2929 If GDP's rise and so forth...
###2931 there would be more enhanced well-being
###2934 and we could take the GDP as being our basic layer indicator
###2938 of social health...
###2939 Well, there you see the confusion.
###2941 It's talking about Money Sequences of Value
###2943 that is, all the receipts and all the revenues that are
###2945 derived from selling goods
###2948 and they're confusing that with life reproduction.
###2951 So, you have built right into this thing from the beginning
###2955 a complete conflation of the money
###2958 and life sequences of value.
###2960 So, we are dealing with a kind of structured delusion
###2964 which becomes more and more deadly
###2966 as the money sequence decouples from producing
###2969 anything at all.
###2970 So, it's a system disorder
###2973 and the system disorder seems to be fatal.
###2978 [Welcome to the Machine]
###2981 In society today, you seldom hear anyone speak
###2984 of the progress of their country or society
###2987 in terms of their physical well-being, state of happiness,
###2991 trust or social stability.
###2993 Rather, the measures are presented to us
###2995 through economic abstractions.
###2997 We have the gross domestic product, the consumer price index,
###3001 the value of the stock market, rates of inflation...
###3004 and so on.
###3005 But does this tell us anything of real value
###3008 as to the quality of people's lives?
###3011 No. All of these measures have to do with
###3013 the money sequence itself and nothing more.
###3017 For example, the Gross Domestic Product of a country
###3020 is a measure of the value of goods and services sold.
###3023 This measure is claimed to correlate to the
###3026 “standard of living” of a country's people.
###3029 In the United States health care accounted for over
###3031 17% of GDP in 2009
###3034 amounting to over 2.5 trillion spent.
###3038 Hence, creating a positive effect on this economic measure.
###3041 And, based on this logic
###3043 it would be even better for the US economy
###3045 if health care services increased more so...
###3048 perhaps to 3 trillion dollars... or 5 trillion
###3051 since that would create more growth
###3052 more jobs and hence boasted by economists
###3055 as a rise in their country's standard of living.
###3059 But wait a minute.
###3060 What do health care services actually represent?
###3064 Well, SICK AND DYING PEOPLE.
###3067 That's right- the more unhealthy people there are in America
###3071 the better the economy.
###3073 Now, that is not an exaggeration or a cynical perspective.
###3077 In fact, if we step back far enough
###3079 you will realize that the GDP
###3081 not only doesn't reflect real public or social health
###3084 on any tangible level
###3085 it is, in fact, mostly a measure
###3088 of industrial inefficiency
###3090 and social degradation.
###3092 And the more you see it rise, the worse things are becoming
###3095 with respect to personal, social
###3098 and environmental integrity.
###3100 You have to create problems to create profit.
###3104 There is no profit under the current paradigm
###3107 in saving lives, putting balance on this planet
###3110 having justice and peace or anything else.
###3113 There is just no profit there.
###3116 There's an old saying-
###3117 Pass a law and create a business'.
###3120 Whether you are creating a business for a lawyer or whatever.
###3122 So, crime does create
###3124 business just like destruction creates
###3127 business in Haiti.
###3128 We have now roughly 2,000,000 people incarcerated
###3132 in this country (USA)
###3133 and of those many are in prisons run
###3136 by private corporations:
###3137 Corrections Corporation of America, Wackenhut
###3139 who trade their stock on Wall Street
###3141 based upon how many people are in jail.
###3144 Now that's sickness.
###3146 But that is a reflection of what
###3148 this economic paradigm calls for.
###3152 So what exactly does this economic paradigm call for?
###3155 What is it that keeps our economic system going?
###3159 Consumption.
###3160 Or more accurately- Cyclical Consumption.
###3164 When we break down the
###3165 foundation of classic market economics
###3167 we are left with a pattern of monetary exchange
###3170 that simply cannot be allowed to stop
###3172 or even substantially slowed
###3174 if the society as we know it
###3176 is to remain operational.
###3178 There are three main actors on the economic stage:
###3181 the employee, the employer
###3183 and the consumer.
###3184 The employee sells labor to the employer for income.
###3187 The employer sells its production services, and hence goods,
###3191 to the consumer for income
###3193 and the consumer, of course, is simply another role
###3195 of the employer and employee
###3197 spending back into the system
###3199 to enable the cyclical consumption to continue.
###3202 In other words, the global market system is based on
###3205 the assumption that there will always be enough
###3207 product demand in a society
###3209 to move enough money around at a rate
###3212 which can keep the consumption process going.
###3215 And the faster the rate of consumption
###3216 the more so-called economic growth is assumed
###3219 and so the machine goes...
###3222 But, hold on-
###3223 I thought an economy was meant to, I don't know...
###3226 “Economize”?
###3228 Doesn't the very term have to do with preservation
###3231 and efficiency and a reduction of waste?
###3234 So how does our system, which demands consumption
###3238 and the more the better, efficiently preserve
###3240 or “Economize” at all?
###3243 Well... it doesn't.
###3245 The intent of the market system is, in fact, the exact opposite
###3248 of what a real economy is supposed to do,
###3251 which is efficiently and conservatively orient
###3253 the materials for production and distribution
###3255 of life supporting goods.
###3258 We live on a finite planet, with finite resources
###3261 where, for example, the oil we utilize took
###3263 millions of years to develop...
###3265 where the minerals we use took billions of years to develop.
###3269 So...having a system that deliberately promotes
###3272 the acceleration of consumption
###3275 for the sake of so-called “economic growth”
###3278 is pure ecocidal insanity.
###3282 Absence of waste, that's what efficiency is.
###3285 Absence of waste?
###3287 This system is more wasteful than all the other
###3289 existing systems in the history of the planet.
###3292 Every level of life organization and life system
###3295 is in a state of crisis and challenge
###3298 and decay or collapse.
###3300 No peer-reviewed journal in the last 30 years
###3303 will tell you anything different:
###3305 that is that every life system is in decline
###3309 as well as social programs...
###3311 as well as our water access.
###3313 Try to name any means of life that
###3315 isn't threatened and endangered...
###3317 You can't.
###3318 There really isn't one and that's very, very despairing.
###3321 But we haven't even figured out the causal mechanism.
###3324 We don't want to face the causal mechanism.
###3326 We just want to go on. You know that's where insanity is
###3329 where you keep doing the same thing over and over again
###3332 even though it clearly doesn't work.
###3335 So you're really
###3337 dealing with not an economic system
###3339 but I would go so far as to say an anti-economic system.
###3344 [The Anti-Economy]
###3347 There is an old saying that the competitive
###3349 market model seeks to
###3351 “create the best possible goods at the lowest possible prices”.
###3355 This statement is essentially the incentive concept
###3358 which justifies market competition
###3361 based on the assumption that the result
###3362 is the production of higher quality goods.
###3366 If I was going to build myself a table from scratch
###3369 I would naturally build it out of the best
###3371 most durable materials possible, right?
###3373 With the intent for it to last as long as possible.
###3376 Why would I want to make something poor
###3378 knowing I would have to eventually do it again
###3380 and expend more materials and more energy?
###3384 Well, as rational as that may seem in the physical world
###3388 when it comes to the market world
###3389 it is not only explicitly irrational
###3392 it is not even an option.
###3394 It is technically impossible to produce
###3396 the best of anything
###3397 if a company is to maintain a competitive edge
###3400 and hence remain affordable to the consumer.
###3403 Literally everything created and set for sale
###3405 in the global economy is immediately inferior
###3408 the moment it is produced
###3410 for it is a mathematical impossibility
###3413 to make the most scientifically advanced, efficient
###3416 and strategically sustainable products.
###3419 This is due to the fact that the market system
###3421 requires that “cost efficiency”
###3423 or the need to reduce expenses
###3425 exists at every stage of production.
###3428 From the cost of labor, to the cost
###3430 of materials and packaging and so on.
###3432 This competitive strategy, of course
###3435 is to make sure the public buys their goods
###3438 rather than from a competing producer
###3440 ...which is doing the exact same thing
###3442 to also make their goods both competitive and affordable.
###3447 This immutably wasteful consequence of the system
###3450 could be termed: Intrinsic Obsolescence.
###3454 However, this is only one part of a larger problem:
###3457 A fundamental governing principle of market economics
###3460 one you will not find in any textbook, by the way
###3463 - is the following:
###3465 “Nothing produced can be allowed to maintain a lifespan
###3468 longer than what can be endured
###3470 in order to continue cyclical consumption.”
###3473 In other words, it is critical that stuff breakdown,
###3476 fail and expire within a certain amount of time.
###3480 This is termed - “Planned obsolescence”.
###3484 Planned obsolesce is the backbone of the underlying market
###3487 strategy of every goods producing corporation in existence.
###3491 While very few, of course
###3492 would admit to such a strategy outright
###3494 what they do is mask it within the
###3496 Intrinsic Obsolescence phenomenon just discussed,
###3500 while often ignoring, or even suppressing
###3502 new advents in technology
###3504 which might create a more sustainable, durable good.
###3508 So, if it wasn't wasteful enough
###3510 that the system inherently cannot allow the most
###3513 durable and efficient goods to be produced,
###3516 Planned Obsolescence deliberately
###3518 recognizes that the longer any good is in operation
###3521 the worse it is for sustaining cyclical consumption
###3524 and hence the market system itself.
###3527 In other words, product sustainability
###3530 is actually inverse to economic growth
###3533 and hence there is a direct, reinforced incentive
###3537 to make sure life spans are short
###3539 of any given good produced.
###3541 And, in fact, the system cannot operate any other way.
###3546 One glance at the sea of landfills now spreading across
###3549 the world show the obsolescence reality.
###3552 There are now billions of cheaply made cell phones
###3555 computers and other technology
###3557 each full of precious, difficult to mine materials
###3560 such as gold, coltan, copper...
###3562 now rotting in vast piles
###3564 usually due to the mere malfunction or obsolescence
###3567 of small parts which, in a conservative society
###3571 could likely be fixed or updated
###3573 and the life of the good extended.
###3575 Unfortunately, as efficient as that may seem
###3578 in our physical reality, living on a
###3580 finite planet with finite resources,
###3583 it is explicitly inefficient, with respect to the market.
###3588 To put into a phrase:
###3589 “Efficiency, Sustainability, and
###3591 Preservation are the enemies of our economic system” .
###3596 Likewise, just a physical goods need to be constantly
###3599 produced and reproduced
###3600 regardless of their environmental impact
###3603 the service industry operates with an equal rational.
###3607 The fact is, there is no monetary benefit
###3610 to resolving any problems
###3612 which are currently being serviced.
###3614 At the end of the day
###3616 the last thing the medical establishment really wants
###3619 is the curing of diseases such as cancer
###3622 which would eliminate countless jobs and trillions in revenue.
###3627 And since we are on the subject...
###3628 Crime and Terrorism in this system are good!
###3632 Well, at least economically...
###3634 for it is employing police
###3636 generating hi-value commodities for security
###3638 not to mention the value of prisons
###3640 that are privately owned - for profit.
###3643 And how about war?
###3645 The war industry in America is a huge driver of GDP -
###3649 one of the most profitable industries -
###3651 producing weapons of death and destruction.
###3655 The favorite game of this industry is to blow things up
###3658 and then can go and rebuild them, for profit.
###3661 We saw this with the windfall billion dollar
###3663 contracts made from the Iraq war.
###3666 The bottom line is that socially negative
###3669 attributes of society
###3670 have become positively rewarded ventures for industry
###3674 and any interest in problem resolution
###3676 or environmental sustainability and conservation
###3680 is intrinsically counter to economic sustainability.
###3685 And this is why
###3687 every time you see the GDP rise in any country
###3690 you are witnessing an increase in necessity
###3693 whether real or contrived
###3695 and by definition, a necessity is rooted in inefficiency.
###3699 Hence, increased necessity means increased inefficiency.
###3704 [Value System Disorder]
###3707 The American dream is based on
###3709 the rampant consumerism.
###3710 It is based upon the fact that
###3713 mainstream media and
###3714 especially commercial advertising
###3716 - all corporations who need this infinite growth -
###3720 have convinced us or brainwashed
###3722 most people in America and the world
###3726 that we have to have X number of material possessions
###3728 and the possibility of gaining infinitely more
###3731 material possessions, in order to be happy.
###3734 That's just not true.
###3735 So why do people continue to buy in this way
###3739 which is ultimately eco-genocidal
###3742 in its systemic effects cumulatively?
###3744 And it just is classical & operant conditioning.
###3747 You simply put inputs of conditioning into the organism
###3752 and you have outputs of desired behaviors
###3755 or goals or objectives.
###3758 And it has all the resources of technology
###3761 and they boast about how they
###3762 get into the minds of infants
###3764 what they hear is already making them
###3767 conditioned to the brand.
###3769 Then you see, that's how
###3771 people have been such fools.
###3772 They have been taught to be fools.
###3775 It's a value system disorder.
###3779 You know, if there is any testament to the plasticity
###3782 of the human mind.
###3783 If there is any proof to how malleable
###3785 human thought is and how easily
###3787 conditioned and guided people can become
###3790 based on the nature of their environmental stimulus
###3792 and what it reinforces:
###3794 the world of commercial advertising is the proof.
###3798 You have to stand in awe
###3801 at the level of brainwashing
###3803 where these programmed robots known as "consumers"
###3807 wander the landscape
###3809 only to walk into a store and spend, say
###3812 4000$ on a handbag
###3815 that likely cost 10 dollars to make
###3817 in a sweatshop overseas.
###3820 Only for the brand status it supposedly
###3822 represents in the culture.
###3825 Or perhaps the ancient communal traditions
###3828 which increase trust and cohesiveness in society -
###3832 which have now been hijacked by acquisitive
###3834 materialistic values where now we annually
###3837 exchange useless crap a few times a year.
###3841 And we might wonder why so many today have a
###3843 compulsion to shopping and acquisition
###3846 when it is clear that they have conditioned from childhood
###3849 to expect material goods
###3851 as a sign of their status with friends and family.
###3855 The fact is, the foundation of any society
###3858 are the values that support its operation
###3860 and our society, as it exists
###3862 can only operate if our values support
###3865 the conspicuous consumption it
###3867 requires to continue the market system.
###3871 75 years ago consumption in America
###3874 and much of the 1st world was half
###3876 of what we see today, per person.
###3878 Today's new consumer culture
###3880 has been manufactured and imposed
###3883 due to the very real need for higher
###3885 and higher levels of consumption.
###3888 And this is why most corporations now spend
###3891 more money on advertising, than the actual process
###3895 of product creation itself.
###3897 They work diligently to create a false need for you to fill.
###3901 And it happens to work.
###3905 [The “Economists”]
###3907 You know economists, in fact, are not economists at all.
###3911 They're propagandists of money value
###3913 and you will find that all of their
###3916 models basically get down to token
###3918 exchanges that are true to profit
###3921 of one side or both sides or whatever
###3923 but they are completely disconnected from the actually
###3926 existing world of reproduction.
###3928 In Ohio, an old man failed to pay his electric bill
###3932 you may be familiar with the case
###3934 and the electric company turned off the electricity and he died.
###3938 The reason they turned it off was
###3939 because it wouldn't have been profitable
###3941 for them to keep it on because he didn't pay his bill.
###3944 Do you believe that was right?
###3946 The responsibility really lies not on
###3948 the electric company for turning it off
###3950 but on those of this man's neighbors and friends
###3953 and associates
###3955 who were not charitable enough
###3956 to enable him, as an individual
###3958 to meet the electric bill.
###3961 HMMMMMM...
###3962 Did I hear that right?
###3964 Did he just say the death of a man
###3966 caused by not having money
###3967 was the responsibility of...
###3969 other people...
###3971 or, in effect, charity?
###3973 Well then, I guess we're gonna need
###3975 a whole lot of infomercials, little miserable
###3978 coin slot donations for bodega counters
###3981 and a bunch of pickle jars
###3983 for the billion people now starving to death
###3986 on this planet...
###3987 because of the very system Milton Friedman promotes.
###3992 Whether you are dealing with the philosophies of
###3995 Milton Friedman, F.A. Hyack
###3996 John Maynard Keynes, Ludwig von Mises
###3999 or any other major market economist
###4001 the basis of rationale
###4003 rarely leaves the money sequence.
###4006 It is like a religion.
###4007 Consumption analysis, stabilization policies
###4010 deficit spending, aggregate demand...
###4013 it exists as a never ending, self-referring
###4015 self-rationalizing circle of discourse
###4019 where universal human need, natural resources
###4023 and any form of physical life supporting efficiency
###4026 is ruled out by default
###4028 and replaced by the singular notion that humans
###4031 seeking advantage over each other for money alone
###4034 motivated by their own, narrow self-interest
###4037 will magically create a sustainable, healthy, balanced society.
###4042 There is no life coordinate in this whole theory
###4045 this whole doctrine.
###4046 What are they doing?
###4048 What they are doing is tracking the money sequences.
###4051 That's all it is, is tracking money sequences
###4055 presupposing everything that matters.
###4058 One: There is no life coordinates...
###4061 whoa... no life coordinates!
###4063 Two: That all the agents are
###4065 self-maximizing preferences seekers.
###4069 That is, they think of nothing other than themselves
###4071 and what they can get most for themselves.
###4073 That's the ruling notion of rationality:
###4077 self-maximizing choice
###4079 and the only thing that they are interested in self-maximizing
###4083 is money or commodities.
###4085 Well, where does social relations come in?
###4087 It doesn't, except in the exchange to self-maximize.
###4091 Where do our natural resources come in?
###4093 They don't, except to exploit.
###4096 Where does the family come in as being able to survive?
###4101 It doesn't. They have to have
###4103 money in order to purchase any good.
###4106 Well, shouldn't an economy
###4108 deal somewhere with human need?
###4109 Isn't that what the fundamental issue is?
###4115 Oh, "need" isn't even in your lexicon.
###4118 You dissolve it into "wants"...
###4121 and what is a want? That means
###4123 money demand that wants to buy.
###4125 Well, if it's money demand that wants to buy
###4128 it has nothing to do with need
###4129 because maybe the person has no money demand
###4132 and desperately needs, say, water supply.
###4135 Or, it may be money demand wants a gold toilet seat.
###4138 Well, where does it all go?
###4140 To the gold toilet seat.
###4142 And you call this economics?
###4144 Really, when one thinks of it
###4146 it's got to be the most bizarre
###4149 delusion in the history of human thought.
###4154 [Monetary System]
###4156 Now- so far we have focused on the market system.
###4160 But this system is actually only
###4162 half of the global economic paradigm.
###4164 The other half is the “Monetary System”.
###4168 While the Market System deals with the interaction of people
###4171 gaming for profit across the spectrum of labor
###4174 production and distribution
###4176 the Monetary System is an underlying set of policies
###4179 set by financial institutions
###4181 which create conditions for the
###4183 market system, among other things.
###4186 It includes terms we often hear
###4188 such as interest rates, loans, debt, the money supply
###4192 inflation, etc.
###4194 And while you might want to pull your hair out listening
###4197 to the gibberish coming from the monetary economists:
###4199 "Modest preemptive actions, can obviate the need
###4204 of more drastic actions, at a later date."
###4207 the nature and effect of this
###4210 system is actually quite simple:
###4212 Our economy has...
###4214 or the global economy has
###4216 three basic things that govern it.
###4217 One is fractional reserve banking
###4219 the banks printing money out of nothing.
###4221 It's also based upon compound interest.
###4224 When you borrow money, you have to pay back more
###4227 than you borrowed, which means that you, in effect
###4229 create money out of thin air
###4232 again, which has to be serviced by creating still more money.
###4236 We live in an infinite growth paradigm.
###4239 The economic paradigm we live in now is a Ponzi scheme.
###4242 Nothing grows forever.
###4245 It's not possible.
###4246 As a great psychologist James Hillman wrote
###4249 “The only thing that grows in the human body after
###4251 a certain age is cancer.”
###4253 It's not just the amount of money that has to keep growing
###4256 it's the amount of consumers.
###4257 Consumers to borrow money at interest
###4259 to generate more money and obviously, that's not possible
###4262 on a finite planet.
###4264 People are basically vehicles to just create money
###4268 which must create more money
###4270 to keep the whole thing from falling apart
###4272 which is what's happening right now.
###4275 There are really only two things anyone needs to know
###4277 about the monetary system:
###4280 1: All money is created out of debt.
###4283 Money is monetized debt
###4285 whether it materialized from treasury bonds
###4288 home loan contracts or credit cards.
###4291 In other words, if all outstanding debt
###4293 was to be repaid right now
###4295 there would not be one dollar in circulation.
###4298 And 2: Interest is charged on virtually all loans made
###4303 and the money needed to pay back this interest
###4306 does not exist in the money supply outright.
###4309 Only the principal is created by the loans
###4312 and the principal is the money supply.
###4314 So, if all this debt was to be repaid right now
###4317 not only would there not be one dollar left in circulation
###4320 there would be a gigantic amount of money owed
###4324 that is literally impossible to pay back, for it does not exist.
###4330 The consequence of all of this is that two things are inevitable:
###4334 Inflation
###4336 and Bankruptcy.
###4338 As far as inflation, this can be seen as a historical trend
###4341 in virtually every country today
###4343 and easily tied to its cause
###4345 which is the perpetual increase of the money supply
###4348 which is required
###4349 to cover the interest charges and keep the system going.
###4354 As far as Bankruptcy
###4355 it comes in the form of debt collapse.
###4359 This collapse will inevitably occur with a person
###4362 a business or a country
###4364 and typically happens when the interest payments
###4366 are no longer possible to make.
###4370 But there is a bright side to all of this...
###4372 well, at least in terms of the market system
###4376 Because debt creates pressure
###4378 Debt creates wage slaves.
###4381 A person in debt is much more likely to take a low wage
###4384 than a person who isn't
###4385 hence becoming a cheap commodity
###4388 so it's great for corporations to have a pool of people
###4390 that have no financial mobility.
###4393 But hey - that same idea also goes for entire countries...
###4398 the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
###4401 which mostly serve as proxies for
###4403 transnational corporate interests
###4405 give gigantic loans to troubled countries
###4408 at very high interest rates
###4409 and then, once the countries are
###4411 deeply in the hole and can't pay
###4413 austerity measures are applied
###4415 the corporations swoop in
###4417 set up sweatshops and take their natural resources.
###4421 Now that's market efficiency.
###4425 But wait – there's more:
###4426 you see- there's this unique
###4428 hybrid of the monetary and market system
###4430 called the stock market
###4432 which rather than, you know, actually produce anything real
###4436 they just buy and sell money itself.
###4439 And when it comes to debt, you know what they do?
###4442 That's right - they trade it.
###4445 They actually buy and sell debt for profit.
###4449 From credit default swaps
###4450 and collateralized debt obligations for consumer debt
###4454 to complex derivative schemes used
###4456 to mask the debt of entire countries
###4459 such as the collusion of
###4460 investment bank Goldman Sachs and Greece
###4462 which nearly collapsed the entire European economy.
###4466 So when it comes to the stock market and Wall Street
###4469 we have an entirely new level of insanity
###4472 born out of the Money Sequence of value.
###4475 All you need to know about markets
###4477 was written in an editorial in the Wall Street Journal
###4480 a couple years ago
###4481 it was called 'Lessons of the Brain-Damaged Investor".
###4485 And in this editorial, they explained why
###4488 people with slight brain damage
###4490 do better as investors
###4492 than people with normal brain functionality.
###4494 Why? Because the slightly
###4496 brain-damaged person has no empathy.
###4499 That's the key. If you don't have any empathy
###4502 you do well as an investor
###4504 and so Wall Street breeds people who have no empathy.
###4509 To go in there and to make decisions
###4511 and to make trades they have no compunction about
###4514 no thought whatsoever as to how what they are doing
###4517 might affect their fellow human being.
###4519 So they breed these robots.
###4521 These people who have no souls
###4524 and since they don't even want to pay these people anymore-
###4527 they are now breeding robots – real robots –
###4529 real algorithmic traders.
###4531 Goldman Sachs in the high frequency trading scandal:
###4533 they put a computer next to the New York Stock Exchange.
###4537 This computer, this “co-located” computer, as they call it:
###4540 it front-runs all the trades on the exchange and
###4542 hits the exchange with volumes of orders
###4545 in ways that "scalp"
###4547 pennies and nickels away from the exchange.
###4549 It's like they're siphoning money all day long.
###4552 They went one quarter last year 30
###4554 or 60 straight days without a single down day
###4557 and made millions of dollars every single day?
###4560 That statistically impossible!
###4564 When I worked on Wall Street, the way it works is
###4566 everyone kicks upstairs to bribes.
###4568 The brokers bribe to the office manager
###4571 the office manager bribes to the regional sales manager.
###4575 The regional sales manager
###4576 bribes to the national sales manager.
###4578 It's a common understanding.
###4580 At Christmas, who gets the biggest bonus at Christmas
###4583 in an average broker job? The compliance officer.
###4586 The compliance officer sits there all day long;
###4588 he's supposed to be making sure you
###4590 don't violate any of the margin rules
###4591 and you're "complying" with the law.
###4594 Of course, yeah, to the extent that
###4596 you can bribe the compliance officer
###4598 yeah, that's right, you are complying with the law!
###4600 So how has fraud become the system?
###4603 It's no longer a byproduct.
###4604 It is the system.
###4606 It's like that old Woody Allen joke. He says:
###4609 “Doctor, my brother thinks he's a chicken.”
###4611 And the doctor says, “Take a pill
###4613 and that should cure the problem.”
###4615 And he says, “No doctor. You don't understand
###4617 We need the eggs.”
###4619 Okay?
###4620 So, the trading of fraudulent claims back and forth
###4623 between banks
###4625 to generate fees
###4626 to generate bonuses
###4627 has become the GDP producing growth
###4631 engine of the United States economy
###4634 even though they are essentially trading fraudulent claims
###4637 that there is absolutely no hope of ever paying back.
###4639 They are processing, generating and re-securitizing nothing.
###4642 If I write $20 billion on a cocktail napkin
###4645 and I sell it to J.P. Morgan and J.P. Morgan writes
###4648 $20 billion on a cocktail napkin
###4651 and we swap those two cocktail napkins at a bar
###4654 and we each pay ourselves a quarter of 1% in a fee
###4657 we make a lot of money for our Christmas bonus.
###4659 We each have on our books a $20 billion cocktail napkin
###4663 which has no real value until such time as
###4667 the system is no longer able to absorb bogus
###4670 cocktail napkins in which case we go to the government
###4672 to get bailed out.
###4675 And because of Wall street and the global stock market
###4677 there are now conservatively about 700 Trillion dollars
###4681 of outstanding fraudulent claims-
###4683 know as derivatives
###4685 still waiting to collapse.
###4687 A value amounting to over 10
###4689 times the gross domestic product
###4691 of the entire planet.
###4694 And while we have seen the bailouts of
###4696 corporations and banks by governments...
###4698 which, of course, comically borrow
###4700 their money from banks to begin with.
###4702 We are now seeing attempts to bailout whole countries
###4705 by conglomerates of other countries
###4707 through the International banks.
###4710 But how do you bailout a planet?
###4714 There is no country out there that isn't now saturated in debt.
###4718 The cascade of sovereign debt defaults we have seen
###4721 can only be the beginning, when the math is taken into account.
###4726 It has been estimated in the United States alone
###4729 that income tax would need to be raised to 65%
###4732 per person just to cover the interest in the near future.
###4737 Economists are now foreshadowing that within a few decades
###4740 60% of the countries on the planet will be bankrupt.
###4745 But hold on-- Let me get this straight.
###4749 The world is going bankrupt
###4752 whatever the hell that means
###4753 because of this idea called "debt"
###4756 which doesn't even exist in the physical reality.
###4759 It's only part of a game we've invented...
###4762 and yet the well being of billions of people
###4765 is now being compromised.
###4767 Extreme layoffs - tent cities- accelerating poverty
###4772 Austerity measures imposed - schools shutting down -
###4775 child hunger...and other levels of familial deprivation
###4780 all because of this elaborate fiction...
###4784 What are we, fucking stupid?!
###4788 Hey! Hey! Mars- my man.
###4790 Help a brother out, uh?
###4794 Grow up, kid.
###4804 Saturn! What's up man?
###4806 You remember that smokin' nebula I hooked you up with
###4808 a while back?
###4812 uh- listen Earth.
###4813 We're getting really tired of you.
###4815 You've been given everything and yet you waste it all.
###4818 You've got plenty of resources and you know it.
###4821 Why don't you grow up and learn
###4822 some responsibility for Christ's sake.
###4824 You're making your mother miserable.
###4832 You're on your own, pal.
###4834 Yeah, whatever.
###4842 [Public Health]
###4845 Now, all of this considered...
###4847 from the waste machine known as the market system-
###4850 to the debt machine known as the monetary system-
###4853 hence creating the monetary-market paradigm
###4857 which defines the global economy today...
###4860 there is one consequence that runs through
###4863 the entire machine:
###4865 Inequality.
###4867 Whether it is market system which creates a natural
###4870 gravitation towards monopoly and power consolidation
###4874 while also generating pockets of wealthy industries
###4877 that tower over others
###4880 regardless of utility-
###4882 such as the fact that top
###4883 hedge fund managers on wall street
###4885 now take home over 300 million dollars a year
###4889 for contributing literally nothing.
###4891 While a scientist looking for a cure for a disease
###4895 trying to help humanity
###4897 might make 60 thousand dollars a year if they're lucky.
###4901 Or whether it is the monetary system
###4903 which has class division built right into its structure.
###4907 For example:
###4908 If I have 1 million dollars to spare and I put it into a CD
###4912 at 4% interest-
###4913 I will make 40,000 dollars a year.
###4915 No social contribution- no nothing.
###4919 However, if I'm a lower class person and have to take loans
###4922 to buy my car or home
###4924 I am paying in interest which
###4926 in abstraction
###4927 is going to pay that millionaire with the 4% CD.
###4931 This stealing from the poor to pay the rich
###4934 is a foundational, built in aspect of the monetary system.
###4938 And it could be labeled “Structural Classism”.
###4943 Of course, historically, social stratification
###4946 has always been deemed unfair
###4948 but obviously accepted overall
###4950 as now 1% of the population owns 40% of the planet's wealth.
###4955 But material fairness aside
###4958 there is something else going on
###4959 underneath the surface of inequality
###4961 causing an incredible deterioration in public health as a whole.
###4966 Well, I think people often are puzzled by the contrast
###4970 between the material success of our societies
###4973 - unprecedented levels of wealth -
###4975 and the many social failings.
###4978 If you look at the rates of
###4982 drug abuse or violence or self harm
###4984 amongst kids or mental illness
###4987 there is clearly something going deeply wrong
###4991 with our societies.
###4992 The data I have been describing
###4996 simply shows that intuition that people
###5000 have had for hundreds of years, that inequality is divisive
###5003 and socially corrosive.
###5004 But, that intuition is truer than I think we ever imagined.
###5008 There are very powerful psychological and social effects
###5012 of inequality. More to do I suppose with feelings
###5015 of superiority and inferiority.
###5018 That kind of division...
###5020 Maybe going with the respect or disrespect
###5023 - people feeling looked down on at the bottom
###5026 which, by the way, is why violence is
###5028 more common in more unequal societies -
###5030 the trigger to violence is so often people feeling looked down
###5034 upon and disrespected.
###5035 If there is one principle I could emphasize
###5039 that is, the most important principle underlying
###5044 the prevention of violence
###5047 it would be “Equality”.
###5050 The single most significant factor
###5051 that affects the rate of violence
###5053 is the degree of equality versus the degree of inequality
###5057 in that society.
###5060 So, what we're looking at is a sort of
###5062 general social dysfunction.
###5065 It's not just one or two things that go wrong
###5067 as inequality increases
###5069 it seems to be everything, whether we are talking about
###5071 crime or health or mental illness or whatever.
###5074 One of the really disturbing findings out there in public health
###5078 is never ever make the mistake of being poor.
###5083 Or being born poor.
###5084 Your health pays for it in endless sorts of ways:
###5087 something known as the 'health socioeconomic gradient'.
###5091 As you move down from the highest strata
###5093 in society, in terms of socioeconomic status
###5096 every step down, health gets worse
###5099 for umpteen different diseases.
###5101 Life expectancy gets worse.
###5102 Infant mortality rate-
###5105 everything you could look at.
###5106 So, a huge issue has been
###5108 why is it that this gradient exists.
###5112 A simple obvious answer
###5114 which is, 'if you're chronically sick, you're not
###5116 going to be very productive
###5118 so, health causes drive socioeconomic differences.'
###5121 Not that in the slightest-
###5123 on the very simple level that
###5124 you could look at the
###5126 socioeconomic status of a 10-year-old
###5128 and that's going to predict something about their health
###5130 decades later.
###5131 So, that's the direction of causality.
###5133 Next one- 'Oh, it's perfectly obvious'-
###5137 poor people can't afford to go to the doctor...
###5139 it's healthcare access?
###5140 It's got nothing to do with that
###5142 because you see these same gradients
###5144 in countries with universal health care and
###5146 socialized medicine.
###5147 Okay – next 'simple explanation':
###5149 Oh -on the average- the poorer you are
###5151 the more likely you are to smoke
###5154 and drink and all sorts of lifestyle risk factors.
###5158 Yeah, those contribute but careful studies have shown
###5161 that it explains maybe about a third of the variability.
###5164 So what's left?
###5165 What's left is having a ton to do
###5168 with the STRESS of poverty
###5171 So, the poorer you are, starting off being
###5174 the person who is one dollar of income behind Bill Gates...
###5178 the poorer you are in this country
###5179 on the average, the worse your health is.
###5181 This tells us something really important:
###5184 the health connection with poverty
###5186 it's not about being poor it's about feeling poor.
###5190 Increasingly we recognize that chronic stress
###5195 is an important influence on health
###5198 but the most important sources of stress
###5200 are the quality of social relations.
###5203 and if there is anything that
###5205 lowers the quality of social relations
###5207 it is the socioeconomic stratification of society.
###5211 What science has now shown is
###5213 that regardless of material wealth
###5215 the stress of simply living in a stratified society
###5219 leads to a vast spectrum of public health problems
###5222 and the greater the inequality, the worse they become.
###5227 Life expectancy: longer in more equal countries.
###5231 Drug Abuse: Less in more equal countries.
###5235 Mental Illness: Less in more equal countries.
###5240 Social Capital - meaning the
###5242 ability of people to trust each other:
###5244 Naturally greater in more equal countries.
###5247 Educational Scores: Higher in more equal countries.
###5252 Homicide rates: less in more equal countries.
###5257 Crime and Rates of Imprisonment:
###5259 Less in more equal countries.
###5262 It goes on and on:
###5264 Infant mortality – obesity - teen birth rate:
###5267 Less in more equal countries.
###5269 and perhaps most interesting:
###5272 Innovation: Greater in more equal countries.
###5276 which challenges the age old notion that a competitive
###5279 stratified society is somehow more creative and inventive.
###5284 Moreover, a study done in the UK
###5286 called The WhiteHall Study
###5288 confirmed that there is a social distribution of disease
###5291 as you go from the top of the socioeconomic ladder
###5294 to the bottom.
###5295 For example, it was found that the lowest rungs
###5297 of the hierarchy had a 4-fold increase
###5300 of heart disease based mortality
###5302 compared to the highest rungs.
###5304 And this pattern exists, irrespective of access to health care.
###5309 Hence - the worse a person's relative financial status
###5312 the worse their health is going to be on average.
###5315 This phenomenon is rooted in what could be termed
###5318 Psychosocial Stress'
###5320 and it is at the foundation of the greatest social distortions
###5324 plaguing our society today.
###5326 Its cause?
###5328 The Monetary-Market System.
###5331 Make no mistake:
###5333 The greatest destroyer of ecology...
###5336 the greatest source of waste, depletion and pollution...
###5340 the greatest purveyor of violence-
###5342 war - crime - poverty - animal abuse and inhumanity...
###5347 the greatest generator of social and personal neurosis...
###5350 mental disorders - depression anxiety...
###5354 Not to mention, the greatest source of social paralysis
###5358 stopping us from moving into new methodologies
###5361 for personal health, global sustainability
###5364 and progress on this planet
###5367 is not some corrupt Government or legislation...
###5370 not some rogue Corporation or banking cartel...
###5374 not some flaw of human nature...
###5377 and not some secret hidden cabal that controls the world.
###5382 It is, in fact:
###5383 The Socio-Economic System itself
###5386 at its very foundation.
###5405 [Part 3: Project Earth ]
###5410 Let's imagine for a moment we had the option
###5413 to redesign human civilization from the ground up.
###5416 What if, hypothetically speaking
###5418 we discovered an exact replica of the planet Earth
###5421 and the only difference between
###5423 this new planet and our current one
###5424 is that human evolution had not occurred.
###5427 It was an open palette.
###5428 No countries, no cities, no pollution, no republicans....
###5432 just a pristine, open environment.
###5435 So what would we do?
###5437 Well, first we need a “goal”, right?
###5440 And it's safe to say that goal would be to survive.
###5443 And not to just survive, but to do so in an optimized, healthy
###5447 prosperous way.
###5449 Most people, indeed, desire to live and
###5451 they would prefer to do so without suffering.
###5454 Therefore, the basis of this civilization
###5456 needs to be as supportive and hence
###5458 sustainable for human life as possible-
###5461 taking into account the material needs
###5463 of all the world's people
###5465 while trying to remove anything
###5467 that can could hurt us in the long run.
###5469 With that goal of “Maximum Sustainability” understood
###5473 next question regards our “method”.
###5476 What kind of approach do we take?
###5478 Well, let's see-
###5480 last I checked, politics was the method of social operation on Earth...
###5484 so what do the doctrines of the republicans, liberals
###5487 conservatives or socialists have to say about societal design?
###5492 Hmmm... not a damn thing.
###5495 Okay then - what about religion?
###5498 Surely the great creator had to have left some blueprints somewhere...
###5501 Nope...nothing I can find.
###5504 Okay then - so what's left?
###5506 It appears something called “Science”.
###5509 Science is unique in that its methods demand not only that ideas
###5513 proposed be tested and replicated...
###5516 but everything science comes up with is also inherently falsifiable.
###5521 In other words, unlike religion and politics
###5523 science has no ego
###5525 and everything it suggests accepts the possibility
###5528 of being proven wrong eventually.
###5531 It holds on to nothing and evolves constantly.
###5534 Well, that sounds natural enough to me.
###5537 So then - based on the current state of scientific knowledge
###5540 in the early 21st century
###5542 along with our goal of “maximum sustainability”
###5545 for the human population
###5547 how do we begin the actual process of construction?
###5550 Well, the first question to ask is:
###5552 What do we need to survive?
###5555 The answer, of course, are Planetary Resources.
###5558 Whether it is the water we drink, the energy we use
###5561 or the raw materials we utilize to create tools and shelter
###5565 the planet hosts an inventory of resources-
###5568 many of which are demanded for our survival.
###5572 So, given that reality
###5574 it then becomes critical to figure out what we have and where it is.
###5578 This means we need to conduct a survey.
###5581 We simply locate and identify every physical resource on the planet
###5585 we can, along with the amount available at each location
###5589 from the deposits of copper, to the most potent locations for
###5592 wind farms to produce energy
###5594 to the natural fresh water springs
###5597 to an assessment of the amount of fish in the ocean
###5599 to the most prime arable land for food cultivation, etc.
###5604 But, since we humans are going to be
###5607 consuming these resources over time
###5609 we then realize that not only do we need to locate and identify-
###5613 we also need to track.
###5616 We need to make sure we don't run out of any of this stuff...
###5618 that would be bad.
###5620 And this means not only tracking our rates of use
###5622 but the rates of earthly regeneration as well
###5626 such as how long it takes for, say
###5629 a tree to grow or a spring to replenish.
###5632 This is called “Dynamic Equilibrium”.
###5635 In other words, if we use up trees faster than they can be grown back-
###5639 we have a serious problem, for it is unsustainable.
###5643 So then, how do we track this inventory
###5646 especially when we recognize that all
###5649 of this stuff is scattered everywhere.
###5651 We have large mineral mines in what we call Africa
###5655 energy concentrations in the Middle East
###5657 huge tidal power possibilities on the Atlantic coast of North America
###5661 the largest supply of fresh water in Brazil, etc.
###5665 Well, once again, good old science has a suggestion:
###5669 it's called “Systems theory”.
###5672 Systems theory recognizes that the fabric of the natural world
###5676 from human biology to the earthly biosphere
###5679 to the gravitational pull of the solar system itself
###5682 is one huge synergistically connected system - fully interlinked.
###5687 Just as human cells connect to form our organs
###5690 and the organs connect to form our bodies
###5693 and since our bodies cannot live without the earthy resources
###5696 of food, air and water, we are intrinsically connected to the earth.
###5701 And so on.
###5702 So - as nature suggests, we take all of this inventory
###5706 and tracking data and create a “system” to manage it.
###5710 A “Global Resource Management System”, in fact
###5713 to account for every relevant resource on the planet.
###5717 There is simply no logical alternative if our goal as a species
###5721 is survival in the long run. We have to keep track as a whole.
###5726 That understood, we can now consider production.
###5729 How do we use all this stuff?
###5731 What will our process of production be and what do we need
###5734 to consider to make sure it is as optimized as possible
###5738 to maximize our sustainability?
###5741 Well the first thing that jumps right out at us is the fact that
###5744 we need to constantly try and preserve.
###5747 The planet's resources are essentially finite.
###5750 So it is important that we be “strategic”.
###5753 "Strategic Preservation" is key.
###5757 The second thing we recognize, is that some resources
###5760 are really not as good as others in their performance.
###5763 In fact, some of this stuff, when put into use
###5766 has a terrible effect of the environment
###5768 which invariably hinders our own health.
###5770 For example: oil and fossil fuels, no matter how you cut it
###5775 release some pretty destructive agents into the environment.
###5778 Therefore, it is critical that we do our best to use such things
###5782 only when we really have to - if at all.
###5785 Fortunately for us, we see a ton of solar – wind – tidal – wave -
###5790 heat differential and geothermal possibilities for energy production
###5795 so we can strategize objectively about what we use and where
###5799 to avoid what could be called “negative retroactions”
###5803 or anything that results from production or use
###5807 that damages the environment and hence, ourselves.
###5810 We will call this “Strategic Safety”
###5813 to couple in with our "Strategic Preservation”.
###5817 But production strategies do not stop there.
###5820 We are going to need an "Efficiency Strategy”
###5823 for the actual mechanics of production itself.
###5826 And what we find is that there are roughly
###5829 three specific protocols we must adhere to:
###5832 One: Every good we produce must be
###5834 designed to last as long as possible.
###5837 Naturally, the more things breakdown
###5839 the more resources we are going to need to replace them
###5842 and the more waste produced.
###5844 Two: When things do break down
###5847 or are no longer usable for whatever reason
###5850 it is critical that we harvest, or recycle as much as we possibly can.
###5854 So the production design must take this into
###5858 account directly at the very earliest stages.
###5861 Three: Quickly evolving technologies, such as electronics
###5865 which are subject to the fastest rates of technological obsolescence
###5869 would need to be designed to
###5871 foreshadow and accommodate physical updates.
###5875 The last thing we want to do is throw away an entire computer
###5879 system just because it has only one broken part or is outdated.
###5883 So we simply design the components to be easily updated
###5886 part by part, standardized and universally interchangeable
###5891 foreshadowed by the current trend of technological change.
###5895 And when we realize that the mechanisms of "Strategic Preservation”
###5899 “Strategic Safety” and “Strategic Efficiency”
###5902 are purely technical considerations
###5905 devoid of any human opinion or bias
###5908 we simply program these strategies into a computer
###5911 which can weigh and calculate all the relevant variables
###5915 allowing us to always arrive at the
###5917 absolute best method for sustainable production
###5920 based on current understandings.
###5923 And while that might sound complex
###5926 all it is is a glorified calculator
###5928 not to mention that such multi-varied
###5930 decision making and monitoring systems
###5932 are already used across the world today
###5934 for isolated purposes. It is simply a process of scaling it out.
###5940 So...
###5941 Now, we not only have our Resource Management System
###5944 but also a Production Management System
###5947 both of which are easily computer automated
###5950 to maximize efficiency, preservation & safety.
###5954 The informational reality is that the human mind
###5957 or even a group of humans, cannot track what needs to be tracked.
###5961 It must be done by computers and it can be.
###5965 And this bring us to the next level: Distribution.
###5969 What sustainability strategies make sense here?
###5972 Well, since we know that the shortest
###5973 distance between two points is a straight line
###5977 and since energy is required to power transport machines
###5980 the less transport distance, the more efficient.
###5984 Producing goods in one continent and shipping them over to another
###5988 only makes sense if the goods in question simply cannot
###5991 be produced in the target area.
###5994 Otherwise, it is nothing but wasteful.
###5996 We must localize production, so distribution is simple
###6000 fast and requires the least amount of energy.
###6003 We'll call this the “Proximity Strategy”
###6006 which simply means we reduce the
###6008 travel of goods as much as possible
###6010 whether raw materials or finished consumer products.
###6014 Of course, it might also be important to
###6016 know what goods are we transporting and why...
###6019 And this falls under the category of Demand.
###6022 And demand is simply what people need to be
###6025 healthy and to have a high quality of life.
###6028 The spectrum of material human needs
###6030 range from core life supporting necessities
###6033 such as food, clean water and shelter...
###6036 to social and recreational goods which allow for relaxation
###6040 and personal - social enjoyment -
###6042 both important factors in human and social health overall.
###6047 So - very simply- we take another survey.
###6050 People describe their needs, demand is
###6052 assessed and production begins based on that demand.
###6056 And since the level of demand of different goods will
###6059 naturally fluctuate and change around different regions
###6062 we need to create a “Demand / Distribution Tracking System"
###6066 so to avoid overruns and shortages.
###6070 Of course, this idea is old news
###6072 it is used in every major store chain today
###6075 to make sure they keep up with their inventory.
###6078 Only this time, we are tracking on a global scale.
###6081 But wait a minute. We really can't fully understand demand
###6085 if we don't account for the actual usage of the good itself.
###6090 Is it logical and sustainable for every single human to, say
###6094 have one of everything made? Regardless of their usage?
###6098 No. That would be simply wasteful and inefficient.
###6103 If a person has a need for a good but that need is only for say:
###6106 45 minutes a day on average
###6109 it would be much more efficient if
###6111 that good was made available to them
###6112 and to others when needed.
###6116 Many forget that it isn't the good they want
###6118 it is the purpose of that good.
###6120 When we realize that the good itself
###6123 is only as important as its utility
###6125 we see that “external restriction”
###6128 or what we might call today “ownership”
###6130 is extremely wasteful and environmentally illogical
###6134 in a fundamental, economic sense.
###6137 So we need devise a strategy called: “Strategic Access”.
###6142 This would be the foundation of our
###6144 "Demand / Distribution Tracking System.”
###6146 which makes sure we can meet the
###6148 demand of the population's needs
###6150 for access of whatever they need, when they need it.
###6154 And as far as physically obtaining the goods
###6157 centralized and regional access
###6159 centers all make sense for the most part
###6162 placed in close proximity to the population
###6165 and a person would simply come in, take the item
###6168 use it and when finished, return it when no longer needed...
###6172 sort of how a library works today.
###6174 In fact, these centers could not only exist in
###6177 the community in the way we see local stores today
###6180 but specialized access centers would exist in specific areas
###6184 where often certain goods are utilized
###6186 saving more energy with less repeat transport.
###6190 And once this Demand Tracking System is in order
###6193 it is tied into our Production Management system
###6196 and, of course, into our Resource Management system
###6200 hence creating a unified dynamically updating
###6203 global economic management machine
###6206 that simply makes sure we remain sustainable
###6208 starting with securing the integrity of our finite resources
###6212 moving to make sure we only create the best
###6215 most strategic goods possible
###6217 while distributing everything in the
###6220 most intelligent and efficient way.
###6222 And the unique result of this preservation based approach
###6227 which is intuitively counter to many
###6230 is that this logical, ground up
###6232 empirical process of preservation and efficiency
###6236 which can only define true human sustainability on the planet
###6241 would likely enable something never before seen in human history.
###6245 Access Abundance...
###6247 not just for a percentage of the global population...
###6251 but the entire civilization.
###6255 This economic model, as was just generalized...
###6258 This responsible, systems approach to total Earth
###6261 resource management and processes
###6264 designed again to do nothing less
###6266 than take care of humanity as whole
###6268 in the most efficient and sustainable way
###6271 could be termed:
###6272 a “RESOURCE-BASED ECONOMY”.
###6275 The idea was defined in the 1970s by
###6278 Social Engineer- Jacque Fresco.
###6281 He understood back then that society was on a collision course
###6284 with nature and itself - unsustainable on every level
###6288 and if things didn't change
###6290 we would destroy ourselves, one way or another.
###6294 Are all of these things you are saying, Jacque...
###6296 could they be built with what we know today?
###6298 Or are you guessing... based on what we know today.
###6303 No, all of these things can be built with what we know today.
###6306 It would take 10 years to change the surface of the earth.
###6309 To rebuild the world into a second Garden of Eden.
###6312 The choice lies with you.
###6313 The stupidity of a nuclear arms race...
###6316 the development of weapons...
###6317 trying to solve your problems politically
###6320 by electing this political party or that political party...
###6323 that all politics is immersed in corruption.
###6325 Let me say it again:
###6326 Communism, socialism, fascism... the Democrats
###6330 the liberals- we want to absorb human beings.
###6333 All organizations that believe in a better life for man:
###6337 there are no Negro problems or Polish problems
###6340 or Jewish problems or Greek problems
###6342 or women's problems – there are human problems!
###6345 I'm not afraid of anybody; I don't work for anyone;
###6347 no one can discharge me.
###6349 I have no boss.
###6350 I am afraid to live in the society we live in today.
###6354 Our society cannot be maintained by this type of incompetency.
###6357 It was great - the free enterprise system -
###6359 about 35 years ago. That was the last of its usefulness.
###6363 Now, we have got to change our way of thinking or perish.
###6368 The horror movies of the future will be our society...
###6372 the way it didn't work
###6374 and politics...
###6375 would be part of a horror movie.
###6379 Well, lots of people today use the term 'cold science'
###6384 because it's analytical
###6387 and they don't even know what analytical means.
###6389 Science means: closer approximations
###6392 to the way the world really works.
###6395 So, it's telling the truth - is what it is
###6398 A scientist doesn't try to get along with people.
###6401 They tell them what their findings are.
###6404 They have to question all things
###6407 and if some scientist comes up with an experiment that shows
###6411 certain materials have certain strengths
###6413 other scientists have to be able to duplicate
###6416 that experiment and come up with the same results.
###6419 Even if a scientist feels that an airplane wing
###6423 due to mathematics or calculations
###6425 can hold up a given amount of weight
###6427 they still pile sandbags on it
###6430 to see when it breaks and they say
###6432 you know my calculations are right or they are not correct'.
###6436 I love that system because it's free of bias
###6439 and free of thinking that math can solve all the problems.
###6443 You have to put your Math to test also.
###6446 I think that every system that can
###6448 be put to test should be put to test.
###6451 And that all decisions should be based upon research.
###6456 A Resource-Based Economy is simply the
###6459 scientific method applied to social concern-
###6462 an approach utterly absent in the world today.
###6465 Society is a technical invention.
###6467 And the most efficient methods of optimized human health
###6470 physical production, distribution, city infrastructure and the like
###6475 reside in the field of science and
###6477 technology - not politics or monetary economics.
###6480 It operates in the same systematic way as, say an airplane
###6485 and there is no Republican or Liberal way to build an airplane.
###6489 Likewise, nature itself is the
###6491 physical referent we use to prove our science
###6494 and it is a set system-
###6496 emerging only from our increased understanding of it.
###6499 In fact, it has no regard for what you
###6502 subjectively think or believe to be true.
###6504 Rather, it gives you an option:
###6506 you can learn and fall in line with its
###6508 natural laws and conduct yourself accordingly-
###6511 invariably creating good health & sustainability...
###6514 or you can go against the current - to no avail.
###6517 It doesn't matter how much you believe you can just
###6520 stand up right now and walk on the wall next to you
###6522 the law of gravity will not allow it.
###6524 If you do not eat - you will die.
###6526 If you are not touched as an infant - you will die.
###6529 As harsh as it may sound, nature is a dictatorship
###6533 and we can either listen to it and come in harmony with it
###6536 or suffer the inevitable adverse consequences.
###6540 So, a Resource-Based Economy is nothing more
###6543 than a set of proven, life supporting understandings
###6546 where all decisions are based upon
###6549 optimized human and environmental sustainability.
###6552 It takes into account the empirical “Life Ground”
###6556 which every human being shares as a need
###6558 regardless, again, of their political or religious philosophy.
###6562 There is no cultural relativism to this approach.
###6566 It isn't a matter of opinion.
###6568 Human needs are human needs
###6570 and having access to the necessities of life, such as clean air
###6574 nutritious food and clean water
###6577 along with a positively reinforcing, stable
###6580 nurturing, non-violent environment, is demanded
###6584 for our mental and physical health
###6587 our evolutionary fitness
###6589 and hence, the species survival itself.
###6592 A Resource-Based Economy
###6594 would be based upon available resources.
###6598 You can't just bring a lot of people to an island
###6601 or build a city of 50,000 people without having access
###6606 to the necessities of life.
###6608 So, when I use the term 'a comprehensive systems approach'
###6613 I'm talking about doing an inventory of the area first
###6617 and determining what that area can supply-
###6620 not just architectural approach-
###6623 not just design approach-
###6626 but design must be based on all of the requirements
###6629 to enhance human life
###6631 and that's what I mean by an integrated way of thinking.
###6635 Food, clothing, shelter, warmth, love -
###6637 All those things are necessary
###6640 and if you deprive people of any of them
###6643 you have a lesser human being, less capable of functioning.
###6649 As previously outlined, a Resource-Based Economy's ground up
###6653 global, systems approach to extraction, production and distribution
###6657 is based upon on a set of true economic mechanisms, or 'strategies'
###6662 which guarantee efficiency and
###6664 sustainability in every area of the economy.
###6668 So, continuing this train of thought regarding logical design-
###6672 what is next in our equation?
###6674 Where does all this materialize?
###6676 Cities.
###6678 The advent of the city is a defining feature of modern civilization.
###6682 Its role is to enable efficient access to the necessities of life
###6686 along with increased social support and community interaction.
###6691 So how would we go about designing an ideal city?
###6694 What shape should we make it?
###6695 Square? Trapezoid?
###6698 Well, given we are going to be moving around the thing
###6700 we might as well make it as equidistant as possible for ease...
###6703 hence the circle.
###6705 What should the city contain?
###6707 Well, naturally we need a residential area, a goods production area
###6711 a power generation area; an agricultural area.
###6715 But we also need nurturing as human beings - hence culture
###6718 nature, recreation and education.
###6722 So lets include a nice open park
###6724 an entertainment/events area for cultural purposes and socializing
###6728 and educational and research facilities.
###6731 And since we are working with a circle
###6733 it seems rational to place these functions in Belts
###6736 based on the amount of land required for each goal
###6739 along with ease of access.
###6742 Very good.
###6743 Now, let's get down to specifics:
###6745 First we need the consider the core
###6747 infrastructure or intestines of the city organism.
###6751 These would be the water, goods
###6753 waste and energy transport channels.
###6755 Just as we have water and sewage systems under our cities today
###6759 we would extend this channeling concept to
###6762 integrate waste recycling and delivery itself.
###6765 No more mailmen or garbage men.
###6767 It is built right in. We could even use
###6770 automated pneumatic tubes and similar technologies.
###6773 Same goes for transport.
###6775 It needs to be integrated and strategically designed to reduce
###6779 or even remove the need for wasteful, independent automobiles.
###6782 Electric trams, conveyors, transveyors and
###6785 maglevs which can take you virtually
###6787 anywhere in the city, even up and down
###6790 along with connecting you to other cities as well.
###6793 And of course, in the event a car is required
###6796 it is automated by satellite for safety and integrity.
###6800 In fact, this automation technology is in working order right now.
###6804 Automobile accidents kill about 1.2 million people every single year;
###6809 injuring about 50 million.
###6811 This is absurd and doesn't have to occur.
###6814 Between efficient city design and automated, driverless cars
###6817 this death toll can be virtually eliminated.
###6821 Agriculture.
###6822 Today, through our haphazard, cost-cutting industrial methods
###6826 using pesticides, excessive fertilizers and other means
###6830 we have successfully destroyed much
###6832 of the the arable land on this planet
###6834 not to mention also extensively poisoning our bodies.
###6837 In fact, industrial and agricultural chemical toxins
###6841 now show up in virtually every human being tested, including infants.
###6847 Fortunately, there is a glaring alternative -
###6850 the soilless mediums of hydroponics and aeroponics
###6853 which also reduce nutrient and water
###6856 requirements by up to 75 % of our current usage.
###6860 Food can now be organically grown on an industrial scale
###6864 in enclosed vertical farms.
###6866 Such as in 50 story 1 acre plots -
###6869 virtually eliminating the need for
###6872 pesticides and hydrocarbons in general.
###6874 This is the future of industrial food cultivation.
###6877 Efficient, clean and abundant.
###6880 So, such advanced systems would be, in part
###6883 what comprise our agricultural belt
###6886 producing all the food required for the entire city's population
###6889 with no need to import anything from the outside
###6892 saving time, waste and energy.
###6896 And speaking of Energy-
###6898 The Energy Belt would work in a systems approach to
###6901 extract electricity from our abundant renewable mediums
###6904 -specifically wind, solar, geothermal and heat differentials
###6908 and if near water potentials - tidal and wave power.
###6912 To avoid intermittency and make sure
###6915 a positive net energy return occurs
###6917 these mediums would operate in an integrated system
###6920 powering each other when needed
###6922 while storing excessive energy to large
###6924 super capacitors under the ground
###6926 so nothing can go to waste.
###6929 And not only does the city power itself
###6931 particular structures will also power independently
###6934 and generate electricity through photovoltaic paints
###6938 structural pressure transducers, the thermocouple effect
###6941 and other current but under utilized technologies.
###6945 But, of course, this begs the question:
###6947 how does this technology, and goods in
###6949 general, get created in the first place?
###6952 This bring us to Production:
###6954 The Industrial Belt, apart from having hospitals and the like
###6957 would be the hub of factory production.
###6959 Completely localized overall
###6961 it would, of course, obtain raw materials by way of
###6963 the global resource management system, just discussed-
###6967 with demand being generated by the population of the city itself.
###6972 As far as the mechanics of production
###6974 we need to discuss a new, powerful phenomenon
###6977 which was sparked very recently in human history
###6980 and is on pace to changing everything.
###6983 It's called Mechanization
###6985 or the automation of labor.
###6988 Well, if you look around, you'll notice that almost
###6991 everything that we use today
###6993 is built automatically.
###6997 Your shoes, your clothes, your home appliances, your car and so on...
###7002 they are all built by machines in an automatic way.
###7008 Can we say that the society has not been
###7011 influenced by these major technological advancements?
###7016 Of course not.
###7017 These systems really dictate new structures
###7022 and new needs and they make a lot of other things obsolete.
###7027 So, we have been going up in the development
###7032 and use of technology in an exponential way.
###7036 So, definitely automation is going to continue. You cannot stop
###7041 technologies that just make sense.
###7044 Labor automation through technology is at the bottom
###7047 of every major social transformation in human history.
###7051 From the agricultural revolution and the invention of the plow
###7054 to the industrial revolution and the invention of the powered machine
###7057 to the information age we live in now through
###7060 essentially the invention of advanced electronics and computers.
###7065 And with regard to advanced production methods today
###7068 mechanization is now evolving on its own.
###7071 Moving away from the traditional method of
###7073 assembling component parts into a configuration -
###7076 into an advanced method of creating
###7079 entire products in one single process.
###7082 Like most engineers, I'm fascinated by biology because it is
###7085 so full of examples of extraordinary pieces of engineering.
###7090 What biology is - is the study of things that copy themselves.
###7096 As good a definition of life as we've got.
###7098 Again, as an engineer, I have always been
###7100 intrigued by the idea of machines copying themselves.
###7103 RepRap is a three-dimensional printer-
###7105 that's to say it is a printer that you plug into your computer and
###7109 instead of making two-dimensional sheets of paper with patterns on
###7112 it makes real, physical, three-dimensional objects.
###7115 Now there's nothing new about that
###7117 3-D printers have been around for about 30 years.
###7120 The big thing about RepRap is that it prints most of its own parts.
###7125 So, if you've got one, you could
###7126 make another one and give it to a friend
###7128 as well as being able to print lots of useful things.
###7131 From the simple printing of basic household goods in your home
###7135 to the printing of an entire automobile body in one swoop
###7138 advanced, automated 3d printing now has the
###7141 potential to transform virtually every field of production.
###7145 Including home construction.
###7147 Contour Crafting is
###7150 actually a fabrication technology-
###7153 the so-called 3-D printing- when you directly build
###7156 3-D objects from a computer model.
###7160 Using Contour Crafting, it will be possible
###7163 to build a 2000 square-foot home
###7166 entirely by the machine, in one day.
###7171 The reason that people are interested in automating construction
###7176 is that it really brings a lot of benefits.
###7179 For example, construction is pretty labor-intensive
###7183 and although it provides jobs for a sector of the society
###7189 it also has issues and complications.
###7194 For example, construction is the most dangerous job that there is.
###7199 It is worse than mining and agriculture.
###7202 That has the highest level of fatality in almost every country.
###7207 Another issue is the waste.
###7210 An average home in the United States has 3 to 7 tons of waste.
###7215 So this is huge if we look at the impact of construction
###7221 and knowing about 40% of all materials
###7224 in the world are used in construction.
###7227 So, a big waste of energy and resources
###7231 and big damage to the environment as well.
###7234 Making homes using hammers and nails and wood
###7239 with the state of our technology today, is really absurd
###7243 and will go the way of our labor class in
###7247 regards to manufacturing in the United States.
###7250 Recently, there was a study by economist David Autor of MIT
###7256 that states that our middle class is obsolete
###7260 and being replaced by automation.
###7263 Quite simply, Mechanization is more productive
###7266 efficient and sustainable than human labor
###7269 in virtually every sector of the economy today.
###7273 Machines do not need vacations, breaks, insurance, pensions
###7276 and they can work 24 hours a day, everyday.
###7279 The output potential and accuracy
###7282 compared to human labor, is unmatched.
###7285 The bottom line: repetitive human labor is becoming obsolete
###7289 and impractical across the world
###7291 and the unemployment you see around you today
###7294 is fundamentally the result of this
###7296 evolution of efficiency in technology.
###7300 For years, market economists have dismissed this growing pattern
###7303 which could be called “Technological Unemployment”
###7307 because of the fact that new sectors always seemed
###7309 to emerge to re-absorb the displaced workers.
###7312 Today, the service sector is the only real hub left
###7316 and currently employs over 80% of the American workforce
###7319 with most industrialized countries maintaining a similar proportion.
###7324 However, this sector now being
###7326 challenged increasingly by automated kiosks-
###7329 automated restaurants and even automated stores.
###7333 Economists today are finally
###7334 acknowledging what they had been denying for years:
###7337 not only is technological unemployment exasperating the current
###7341 labor crisis we see across the
###7343 world due to the global economic downturn
###7346 but the more the recession deepens
###7348 the faster the industries are mechanizing.
###7351 The catch, which is not realized
###7353 is that the faster they mechanize to save money;
###7356 the more they displace people-
###7357 the more they reduce public purchasing power.
###7361 This means that, while the corporation
###7362 can produce everything more cheaply
###7364 fewer and fewer people will actually have money to buy anything
###7368 regardless of how cheap they become.
###7371 The bottom line is that the “labor for
###7373 income” game is slowly coming to an end.
###7376 In fact, if you take a moment to reflect
###7379 on the jobs which are in existence today
###7381 which automation could take over right now, if applied
###7385 75% of the global workforce could be
###7388 replaced by mechanization tomorrow.
###7391 And this is why, in a Resource-Based Economy
###7394 There is no Monetary-Market system.
###7397 No money at all...
###7399 for there is no need.
###7401 a Resource-Based Economy
###7403 recognizes the efficiency of mechanization
###7405 and accepts it for what it offers.
###7407 It doesn't fight it, like we do today.
###7410 Why? Because it is irresponsible not to
###7413 given any interest in efficiency and sustainability.
###7418 And this brings us back to our city system.
###7421 In the center is the Central Dome
###7423 which not only houses the
###7425 educational facilities and transportation hub-
###7427 it also hosts the mainframe that
###7429 runs the cities technical operations.
###7432 The city is, in fact, one big automated machine.
###7435 It has sensors in all technical belts
###7437 to track the progress of architecture-
###7439 energy gathering, production, distribution and the like.
###7444 Now, would people be needed to oversee these
###7446 operations in the event of a malfunction and the like?
###7449 Most probably: yes.
###7451 But that number would decrease
###7452 over time as improvements continue.
###7455 However, as of today, maybe 3% of
###7457 the city population would be needed
###7459 for this job when you break it down.
###7462 And I can assure you:
###7464 that in an economic system which is
###7466 actually designed to take care of you
###7468 and secure your well being
###7470 without you having to submit to
###7472 private dictatorship on a daily basis...
###7475 usually to a job that is either
###7477 technically unnecessary or socially pointless
###7480 while often struggling with debt that doesn't exist
###7483 just to make ends meet...
###7485 I guarantee you: people will volunteer their time left and right
###7490 to maintain and improve a system
###7493 that actually takes care of them.
###7497 And coupled with this issue of 'Incentive'-
###7500 comes the common assumption that
###7502 if there isn't some external pressure
###7504 for one to “work for a living”
###7506 people would just sit around, do nothing
###7509 and turn into fat lazy blobs.
###7512 This is nonsense.
###7514 The labor system we have today is
###7516 in fact the generator of laziness-
###7519 not a resolver of it.
###7522 If you think back to when you were a child-
###7524 full of life, interested in new things to understand-
###7527 likely creating and exploring...
###7529 but as time went on, the system pushed you
###7532 into the focus of figuring out how to make money.
###7536 And from early education
###7537 to study at a university, you are narrowed.
###7540 Only to emerge as a creature which serves
###7543 as a cog in a wheel in a model that
###7546 sends all the fruits to the upper 1%.
###7549 Scientific Studies have now shown that people are, in fact
###7552 not motivated by monetary reward
###7555 when it comes to ingenuity and creation.
###7557 The creation itself is the reward.
###7560 Money, in fact, appears only to serve as an incentive
###7563 for repetitive, mundane actions-
###7566 a role we have just now shown can be replaced by machine.
###7570 When it comes to innovation
###7572 the actual use of the human mind
###7574 the monetary incentive has proven to be a hindrance
###7577 interfering and detracting from creative thought.
###7581 And this might explain why Nikola Tesla, the Wright Brothers
###7584 and other inventors who contributed massively
###7586 to our current world
###7588 never showed a monetary incentive to do so.
###7591 Money is, in fact, a false incentive
###7595 and causes 100 times more distortion
###7598 than it does contribution.
###7602 Good morning class. Please settle down.
###7604 The first thing I would like to do is go around the room
###7608 and ask what everyone would like to be when they grow up.
###7611 Who would like to go first?
###7614 Okay, how about you Sarah?
###7616 When I grow up I want to work at McDonald's like my mom!
###7620 Oh, family tradition, eh?
###7623 How about you, Linda?
###7625 When I grow up, I'm going to be a
###7628 prostitute on the streets of New York City!
###7631 Oh! glamour girl, huh?
###7633 Very ambitious.
###7635 How about you, Tommy?
###7636 When I grow up, I'm going to be a
###7639 rich, elitist businessman who works
###7641 on Wall Street and profits off of
###7643 the collapse of foreign economies.
###7645 Enterprising...
###7646 And great to see some multicultural interest!
###7652 [Victims of Culture]
###7653 As stated before, a Resource-Based
###7656 Economy applies the Scientific Method to social concern
###7660 and this isn't limited to simply technical efficiency.
###7663 It also has the consideration of
###7665 human and social well-being directly and what comprises it.
###7669 What good is a social system if, in the end
###7672 it doesn't produce happiness and peaceful coexistence?
###7675 So, it is important to point out that
###7678 with the removal of the money system
###7680 and the necessities of life provided
###7682 we would see a global reduction in
###7685 crime by about 95% almost immediately
###7688 for there is nothing to steal, embezzle, scam, or the like.
###7692 95% of all people in prisons today are there
###7694 due to some monetary related crime or drug abuse
###7698 and drug abuse is a disorder - not a crime.
###7703 So what about the other 5%?
###7705 the truly violent...
###7707 often seeming to some as being
###7708 violent for the sake of being violent...
###7711 are they just “evil” people?
###7715 The reason that I frankly think it's a waste of time
###7720 to engage in moral value judgments
###7723 about people's violence is
###7726 because it doesn't advance by one iota
###7730 our understanding of either the causes
###7733 or the prevention of the violent behavior.
###7737 People sometimes ask if I believe in “forgiving” criminals.
###7742 My answer to that is
###7744 “No, I don't believe in forgiveness
###7747 anymore than I believe in condemnation”.
###7750 It's only if we, as a society
###7753 can take the same attitude of treating violence as
###7756 a problem in public health and preventive medicine
###7759 rather than as a moral "evil"...
###7762 it's only when we make that change in our
###7765 own attitudes and assumptions and values
###7768 that we will actually succeed in reducing the
###7771 level of violence rather than stimulating it-
###7774 which is what we do now.
###7776 The more justice you seek, the more hurt you become
###7779 because there's no such thing as justice.
###7781 There is whatever there is out there. That's it.
###7786 In other words, if people are conditioned to be racist bigots-
###7790 if they are brought up in an environment that advocates that
###7793 why do you blame the person for it?
###7795 They are a victim of a subculture.
###7798 Therefore they have to be helped.
###7800 The point is, we have to redesign the environment
###7803 that produces aberrant behavior.
###7806 That's the problem.
###7807 Not putting a person in jail.
###7809 That's why judges- lawyers-
###7812 “freedom of choice” - such concepts
###7815 are dangerous, because it gives you mis-information.
###7819 That the person is “bad”... or that person is a “serial killer”.
###7823 Serial killers are made
###7825 just like soldiers become serial killers with a machine gun.
###7830 They become killing machines, but nobody
###7832 looks at them as murderers or assassins
###7835 because that's “natural”.
###7837 So we blame people.
###7839 We say, “Well, this guy was a Nazi - he tortured Jews”.
###7842 No, he was brought up to torture Jews.
###7845 Once you accept the fact that people
###7847 have individual choices and they are free
###7850 to make those choices... Free to make
###7853 choices means without being influenced
###7855 and I can't understand that at all.
###7858 All of us are influenced in all of our choices
###7862 by the culture we live in, by our parents
###7865 and by the values that dominate.
###7867 So, we're influenced- so there can't be “free” choices.
###7870 What's the greatest country in the world?' - the true answer:
###7873 I haven't been all over the world and I don't know
###7876 enough about different cultures to answer that question.'
###7880 I don't know anybody that speaks that way.
###7882 They say 'it's the good old USA!
###7884 the greatest country in the world!'
###7886 There is no survey... 'Have you been to India?' - 'No.'
###7888 Have you been to England?' - 'No.'
###7890 Have you been to France?' - 'No.'
###7891 Then what do you make your assumptions on?'
###7893 They can't answer- they get mad at you.
###7895 They say, 'God dammit! Who the hell
###7897 are you to tell me what to think?!'
###7899 You know... Don't forget: you're dealing with aberrated people.
###7902 They are not responsible for the answers;
###7904 they're victims of culture and that means
###7907 they have been influenced by their culture.
###7929 [Part 4: Rise]
###7937 When we consider a Resource-Based Economy
###7940 there are often a number of arguments that tend to come up with...
###7943 [EH!] (Interrupted)
###7944 [Eh! Hey!]
###7946 [Now hold on just a minute!]
###7949 [I know what this is. This is called Marxism, buddy.]
###7953 [Stalin killed 800 billion people because of ideas like this...]
###7958 [My father died in the Gulag!]
###7961 [Communist! Fascist!]
###7964 [You don't like America you should just leave!]
###7965 All right, everybody just calm down...
###7967 [Death to the New World Order!]
###7969 [Death to the New World Order!]
###7971 And as the irrationality of the
###7973 audience grew, shocked and confused:
###7975 suddenly the narrator suffered a fatal heart attack.'
###7979 And the seemingly communist propaganda film was no more.
###7985 [System Error]
###7990 [Backup Initiated - Restored]
###7993 But you know, I've said that sort of thing to people
###7996 in 'think tank' type situations
###7999 you know these Club of Rome types and so forth...
###8003 they say ”Marxist!”
###8004 What? Marxist? Where did that come from?
###8006 They just got this icon they hold onto-
###8010 It's their Holy Grail
###8012 and it's such an easy one, you know.
###8014 People ask if I'm a Socialist or a Communist or Capitalist
###8018 I say I am none of the above. Why do you
###8020 think that those are the only options?
###8022 All of those political constructs
###8024 were created by writers who assumed
###8027 we lived on a planet of infinite resources.
###8030 Not one of those political philosophies even
###8033 contemplates that there might be a shortage of anything.
###8036 I believe that communism, socialism, free enterprise, fascism
###8041 are part of social evolution.
###8043 You can't take a giant step
###8046 from one culture to another-
###8047 there are in-between systems.
###8049 Before there's any “Ism”, we have a life ground
###8051 and the life ground is as I've just described
###8053 most easily as all the conditions
###8055 required to take your next breath
###8057 and that involves the air you breathe
###8059 the water you get, the safety you have
###8063 the education you can access- all
###8065 these things that we share and use and that
###8067 no life, in any culture, can do without.
###8071 So we've got to reset down to the Life Ground
###8074 and the life ground is no longer any “Ism”.
###8077 It's “life value analysis.”
###8081 [Beyond The Pale]
###8083 It's simply a matter of historical fact
###8086 that the dominant intellectual culture
###8088 of any particular society reflects the
###8090 interests of the dominant group in that society.
###8094 In a slave owning society
###8096 the beliefs about human beings and human rights
###8099 and so on will reflect the needs of the slave owners.
###8102 In the society, again, which is based on
###8105 the power of certain people to control and profit from
###8110 the lives and work of millions of others
###8113 the dominant intellectual culture will
###8116 reflect the needs of the dominant group.
###8118 So, if you look across the board, the
###8122 ideas that pervade psychology and
###8125 sociology and history
###8128 and political economy and political science
###8130 fundamentally reflect certain elite interests.
###8134 And the academics who question that too much
###8138 tend to get shunted to the side or
###8141 to be seen as sort of “radicals”.
###8143 The dominant values of a culture
###8145 tend to support and perpetuate
###8147 what is rewarded by that culture.
###8150 And in a society where success and
###8152 status is measured by material wealth
###8154 - not social contribution -
###8156 it is easy to see why the state of the world is what it is today.
###8161 We are dealing with a value system disorder
###8164 - completely denatured -
###8166 where the priority of personal and social health
###8168 have become secondary to the detrimental
###8171 notions of artificial wealth and limitless growth.
###8175 And, like a virus, this disorder now
###8177 permeates every facet of government
###8179 - news media - entertainment - and even academia.
###8183 And built into its structure
###8185 are mechanisms of protection
###8187 from anything that might interfere.
###8190 Disciples of the Monetary-Market religion
###8193 the Self-Appointed Guardians of the Status Quo
###8196 constantly seek out ways to avoid any form of thought
###8200 which might interfere with their beliefs.
###8202 The most common of which: are Projected Dualities.
###8206 If you're not a Republican, you must be a Democrat.
###8209 If you are not Christian, you might be a Satanist
###8212 and if you feel society can be greatly improved
###8215 to consider, perhaps - I don't know-
###8217 taking care of everyone?
###8219 you're just a “Utopianist”.
###8221 And the most insidious of them all:
###8223 if you are not for the "free-market"
###8226 you must be against freedom itself.
###8228 I'm a believer in freedom!
###8231 Every time you hear the word freedom
###8232 being said anywhere or government interference
###8235 said anywhere, it means, decoded:
###8239 blocking maximization of turning money
###8243 into more money for private money possessors.
###8247 That's it. Every other thing they'll say:
###8249 'Oh, we need more commodities for people';
###8251 'Oh, this is freedom against tyranny' and so forth
###8255 every time you see it, you can decode it down to
###8258 that and I think you'll find a one-to-one correlation
###8261 with every time they use it.
###8262 And this, in a sense, we might call:
###8265 a Syntax. A governing syntax of understanding and of value.
###8270 So, it governs beneath their own recognition of it
###8273 so they might say: 'Oh, I didn't mean that at all!'
###8276 but in fact, that's what they do.
###8278 Just like you may speak a grammar
###8280 and you have rules of grammar you follow
###8282 without recognizing what the rules are...
###8284 and so what we have is what I call the “Ruling Value Syntax”
###8288 that underlies this. So, every time they use these words:
###8291 government interference'; 'lack of freedom' or 'freedom'
###8295 or 'progress' or 'development'
###8297 you can decode them all to come back to mean that.
###8302 Of course, when you hear the word 'freedom'
###8305 it tends to be in same sentence
###8307 with something called 'democracy'.
###8310 It's fascinating how people today seem to believe
###8313 that they actually have a relevant
###8315 influence on what their government does
###8317 forgetting that the very nature of
###8320 our system offers everything for sale.
###8322 The only vote that counts is the monetary vote
###8325 and it doesn't matter how much any
###8327 activist yells about ethics and accountability.
###8330 In a market system, every politician, every legislation
###8334 and hence, every government is for sale.
###8338 And even with the 20 trillion dollar bank bailouts
###8341 starting in 2007
###8343 an amount of money which could have changed
###8346 say, the global energy infrastructure
###8348 to fully renewable methods
###8350 instead going to a series of institutions
###8352 that literally do nothing to help society
###8355 institutions that could be
###8356 removed tomorrow with no recourse...
###8359 the blind conditioning that politics and
###8362 politicians exist for the public well-being still continues.
###8368 The fact is, politics is a business
###8371 - no different than any other in a market system
###8374 and they care about their self-interest before anything else.
###8378 I don't really, honestly, deep down believe in political action.
###8382 I think the system contracts and expands as it wants to.
###8385 It accommodates these changes.
###8387 I think the civil rights movement was an accommodation
###8390 on the part of those who own the country.
###8392 I think they see where their self-interest lies;
###8395 they see a certain amount of freedom seems good
###8397 -an illusion of liberty- give these people a voting day every year
###8401 so that they will have the illusion of meaningless choice.
###8404 Meaningless choice- that we go, like slaves and say
###8407 “Oh, I Voted.” The limits of debate in this country are established
###8411 before the debate even begins and everyone
###8413 else is marginalized and made to seem either
###8415 to be communist or some sort of disloyal person
###8417 -a “kook”- there's a word...
###8419 and now it's “conspiracy”. See- they made that.
###8421 Something that should not be even entertained for a minute:
###8424 that powerful people might get together and have a plan!
###8428 Doesn't happen! You're a “kook”! Your a “conspiracy buff”!
###8433 And of all the mechanisms of defense of this system
###8437 there are two that repeatedly come up.
###8440 The first is this idea that the system has been the “cause”
###8443 of the material progress we have seen on this planet.
###8447 Well...No.
###8449 There are basically two root causes which
###8451 have created the increased so-called “wealth”
###8454 and population growth we see today.
###8457 One: the exponential advancement of production technology;
###8461 hence scientific ingenuity.
###8463 And Two: the initial discovery of abundant hydrocarbon energy
###8468 -which is currently the foundation of the entire socio-economic system.
###8473 The free-market / capitalist / monetary
###8475 market system - whatever you want to call it -
###8477 has done nothing but ride the wave of these advents
###8481 with a distorted incentive system and a haphazard
###8484 grossly unequal method of utilizing and distributing those fruits.
###8490 The second defense is a belligerent social bias
###8493 generated from years of propaganda
###8496 which sees any other social system
###8498 as a route to so called "tyranny”
###8501 with various name droppings of Stalin, Mao, Hitler...
###8504 and the death tolls they generated.
###8507 Well, as despotic as these men might have been
###8510 along with the societal approaches they perpetuated...
###8513 when it comes to the game of death
###8515 - when comes to the systematic
###8517 daily mass murder of human beings -
###8520 Nothing in history compares to what we have today.
###8524 Famines - throughout at least the last century of our history
###8530 have not been caused by a lack of food.
###8532 They have been caused by relative poverty.
###8536 The economic resources were so inequitably distributed
###8540 that the poor simply didn't have enough money
###8543 with which to buy the food that would've been
###8546 available if they could have afforded to pay for it.
###8549 That would be an example of Structural Violence.
###8552 Another example: in Africa and other areas-
###8556 I'll particularly focus on Africa-
###8559 tens of millions of people are dying of AIDS.
###8562 Why are they dying?
###8564 It's not because we don't know how to treat AIDS.
###8567 We have millions of people in the wealthy countries
###8571 getting along remarkably well because
###8574 they have the medicines that will treat it.
###8577 The people in Africa who are dying of AIDS
###8580 are not dying because of the HIV virus...
###8583 they are dying because they don't have the money with
###8586 which to pay for the drugs that would keep them alive.
###8589 Gandhi saw this. He said:
###8591 “The deadliest form of violence is poverty.”
###8596 And that's absolutely right.
###8598 Poverty kills far more people than all the wars in history;
###8603 more people than all the murderers in history;
###8605 more than all the suicides in history...
###8608 not only does Structural Violence kill more people
###8612 than all the behavioral violence put together
###8615 Structural Violence is also the
###8618 main cause of behavioral violence.
###8622 [Beyond the Peak]
###8626 Oil is the foundation of
###8631 and is present throughout, the edifice of human civilization.
###8635 There are 10 calories of hydrocarbon energy –oil and natural gas–
###8639 in every calorie of food you and I eat in the industrialized world.
###8643 Fertilizers are made from natural gas.
###8646 Pesticides are made from oil.
###8648 You drive oil-powered machines to plant - plow - irrigate – harvest
###8651 transport - package. You wrap the food
###8654 in plastic – that's oil. All plastic is oil.
###8656 There are 7 gallons of oil in every tire.
###8659 Oil is everywhere; it's ubiquitous. And it's only because
###8662 of oil that there are 7 billion people or
###8664 almost 7 billion people on this planet right now.
###8667 The arrival of this cheap and easy energy
###8670 which is equivalent, by the way, to
###8672 billions of slaves working around the clock
###8676 changed the world in such a radical way over the last century
###8680 and the population has gone up 10 times.
###8683 But, by 2050, oil supply is able to support
###8687 less than half the present world's
###8689 population in their present way of life.
###8692 So, the scale of adjustment to live differently is just enormous.
###8697 The world is now using six barrels of oil for every barrel of finds.
###8701 Five years ago it was using four
###8703 barrels of oil for every barrel it finds.
###8705 A year from now it is going to be using
###8707 eight barrels of oil for every barrel of finds.
###8709 What's disturbing to me is the
###8711 lack of any real effort from governments worldwide
###8716 and industry leaders worldwide to do something different.
###8720 We have these, sort of, attempts to build more wind power
###8724 and to maybe do something with Tide...
###8726 we've got attempts to make our cars a little bit more efficient
###8731 but there's nothing which really looks like a
###8733 revolution coming along- these are all pretty minor
###8736 and that I think is pretty frightening.
###8738 And the governments who are driven by these economists
###8742 who don't really appreciate what we're talking about
###8745 are trying to stimulate consumerism to restore past prosperity
###8750 in the hope that they can restore the past.
###8752 They're printing yet more money lacking any collateral at all.
###8756 So, if the economy improves and
###8758 recovers and the famous growth comes back
###8761 it will only be short-lived because
###8763 within a short period of time counted in months
###8767 rather than years it will hit the supply barrier again;
###8771 there will be another price shock-
###8772 and a deeper recession. So I think
###8774 we go into a series of vicious circles
###8776 So you have the economic growth going up- price
###8778 spike- everything shuts down. That's where we are now.
###8781 Then it starts to come up again but what we have now is this
###8784 area where there's no more ability to produce cheap energy.
###8788 We're at the peak- were on the down slope of oil production.
###8791 No way you're going to get any more out of the ground any faster
###8795 which means that things shut down, the price of oil drops
###8799 which it did in early 2009 but then as you have a “recovery”
###8805 the price of oil starts to come back.
###8807 It's recently been hovering at about $80
###8809 a barrel and what we see is that at even at $80 a
###8811 barrel now, with the financial and economic collapse
###8814 people are having a hard time affording that.
###8815 World oil production right now is about 86 million barrels a day.
###8820 Over 10 years, you're looking at
###8824 roughly 14 million barrels a day having to be replaced.
###8828 There's nothing around which can come even
###8832 within 1% of meeting that sort of demand.
###8834 If we don't do something pretty quickly
###8837 there's going to be a huge energy deficiency.
###8840 I think the big mistake is in not recognizing
###8844 a decade or so ago that a concerted effort
###8848 needed to be made to develop
###8850 these sustainable forms of energy.
###8851 I think that's something our grandchildren will look back on with
###8855 total disbelief. 'You people knew you
###8859 were dealing with a finite commodity...
###8862 how could you possibly have build your economy
###8865 around something which was going to disappear?'
###8869 For the first time in human history
###8871 the species is now faced with the depletion of a core resource
###8874 central to our current system of survival.
###8877 And the punchline of the whole thing is
###8879 that even with oil becoming more scarce
###8882 the economic system will still blindly push
###8885 its cancerous growth model...
###8887 so people can go out and buy more oil powered cars
###8890 to generate GDP and jobs... exasperating the decline.
###8896 Are there solutions to replace the
###8898 edifice of the hydrocarbon economy?
###8900 Of course.
###8901 But the path needed to accomplish these changes
###8904 will not manifest through the Market System Protocols required
###8908 since new solutions can only be
###8910 implemented through the Profit Mechanism.
###8913 People are not investing in renewable energies
###8916 because there is no money in it in both long and short term.
###8920 And the commitment needed to make it happen
###8922 can only occur at a severe financial loss.
###8925 Therefore, there is no monetary incentive and in this
###8928 system, if there is no monetary incentive, things do not happen.
###8933 And on top of it all, Peak Oil is
###8935 just one of many surfacing consequences
###8938 of the environmental-social train wreck gaining speed today.
###8942 Other declines include Fresh Water
###8945 -the very fabric of our existence-
###8947 which is currently showing
###8949 shortages for 2.8 billion people
###8951 and those shortages are on pace to reach 4 billion by 2030.
###8956 Food Production:
###8957 The destruction of arable crop land, from which
###8961 99.7% of all human food comes from today
###8964 is occurring up to 40 times faster than it is being replenished
###8969 and over the last 40 years, 30% of the
###8971 arable land has become unproductive.
###8974 Not to mention that hydrocarbons are the backbone
###8977 of agriculture today and as it declines...
###8980 so will the food supply.
###8982 As far as resources in general
###8984 at our current patterns of consumption, by 2030
###8987 we will need 2 planets to continue our rates.
###8991 Not to mention the continual destruction
###8993 of life supporting biodiversity
###8995 causing extinction spasms and
###8997 environmental destabilization across the globe.
###9000 And with all of these declines
###9002 we have the near exponential population growth
###9005 where by 2030 there might be over
###9008 8 billion people on this planet.
###9010 Energy production alone would need to
###9013 increase 44% by 2030 to meet such demand.
###9017 And again, since money is the only initiator of action-
###9022 are we to expect that any country on
###9024 the planet is going to be able to afford
###9026 the massive changes needed to revolutionize agriculture
###9029 water processing, energy production and the like?
###9033 When the global debt pyramid scheme is
###9035 slowly shutting the entire world down...
###9037 Not to mention the fact that
###9039 the unemployment you currently see
###9040 is going to become normality due to
###9043 the nature of technological unemployment.
###9045 The jobs are not coming back.
###9048 And finally, a broad social perspective.
###9050 From the 1970 to 2010, poverty on this
###9053 planet doubled due to this system...
###9056 and given our current state-
###9058 do you honestly think we will see
###9060 anything less than more doubling...
###9062 more suffering and more mass starvation?
###9066 [The Beginning]
###9068 There is not going to be any recovery.
###9071 This is not some long depression
###9073 that we're some day going to pull out of.
###9075 I think the next phase that we are going to see after the
###9078 next round of economic collapses is massive civil unrest.
###9081 When unemployment checks stop being
###9083 paid because the states have no money left.
###9085 And when things get so bad that people lose confidence
###9089 in their elected leaders, they will demand change
###9093 if we don't kill each other in the process
###9096 or destroy the environment.
###9098 I'm just afraid that we might get to the point of no return...
###9103 and that bothers me to no end.
###9105 We do all we can to avoid that condition.
###9110 It's clear that we're on the verge of a great transition in human life...
###9116 That what we face now is this fundamental
###9119 change of the life we've known over the last century.
###9123 There has to be a link between the economy and
###9126 the resources of this planet
###9128 the resources being, of course, all animal and plant life;
###9131 the health of the oceans and everything else.
###9135 This is a monetary paradigm that will not
###9138 let go until it's killed the last human being.
###9142 The "in" group will do all it can to stay in power
###9147 and that's what you've got to keep in mind.
###9149 They'll use the army and navy and lies..
###9152 or whatever they have to use to keep in power.
###9155 They're not about to give it up
###9157 because they don't know of any other system that will perpetuate their kind.
