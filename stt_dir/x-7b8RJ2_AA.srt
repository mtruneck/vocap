0:2:17,969 --> 0:2:21,59
fee ends that loves beer ads for it


55
0:2:21,59 --> 0:2:26,53

57
0:2:32,469 --> 0:2:36,119

59
0:2:37,32 --> 0:2:38,14
drawers


60
0:2:38,14 --> 0:2:42,139
what what is your legs you know a time
by compassionate conservative center


61
0:2:42,139 --> 0:2:43,74
well he's says the


62
0:2:43,74 --> 0:2:45,11
proves the point quote


63
0:2:45,11 --> 0:2:48,23
the best way for people understand what
i meant by compassionate conservative


64
0:2:48,23 --> 0:2:50,409
is a lot of the programs we implemented


65
0:2:50,409 --> 0:2:53,979
and look at the results


66
0:2:53,979 --> 0:2:55,11
lou the results


67
0:2:55,11 --> 0:2:58,45
iraq war over a hundred thousand sleeves
killed more than five thousand marcus


68
0:2:58,45 --> 0:2:59,8
gill


69
0:2:59,8 --> 0:3:0,409
about forty thousand


70
0:3:0,409 --> 0:3:3,849
wounded you know when you put private
contractors and several over trillion


71
0:3:3,849 --> 0:3:5,41
dollars wasalam out war


72
0:3:5,41 --> 0:3:8,709
the disastrous response that working to
trina


73
0:3:8,709 --> 0:3:10,98
and the list goes on and on just one of
the results


74
0:3:10,98 --> 0:3:14,73
and gigantic devasena trillion dollar
deficit he left behind


75
0:3:14,73 --> 0:3:18,359
when he applied all five hundred billion
dollar surplus standard room


76
0:3:18,359 --> 0:3:21,569
by bill clinton just look at the results
that you get a sense


77
0:3:21,569 --> 0:3:24,16
of whether this man was a compassionate
conservative


78
0:3:24,16 --> 0:3:27,159
or got anything done at all and he knows


79
0:3:27,159 --> 0:3:28,999
any notices an embarrassment


80
0:3:28,999 --> 0:3:33,99
so ask her about his record who lent out
telling this to see says he's not


81
0:3:33,99 --> 0:3:37,299
interested infant reporting or self-pity


82
0:3:37,299 --> 0:3:41,289
now i guess a successful person like
bill gates we give you the answer


83
0:3:41,289 --> 0:3:45,69
we sell out it is unfair pouring out on
parade and self-pity


84
0:3:45,69 --> 0:3:46,21
only a person


85
0:3:46,21 --> 0:3:48,2
whose loaded with self-pity


86
0:3:48,2 --> 0:3:51,199
and realizes he's a false is dope or
vendors


87
0:3:51,199 --> 0:3:54,53
when jack that was abenney what warren
buffett say that why would bill


88
0:3:54,53 --> 0:3:57,21
they say that why would a successful
third president like bill clinton said


89
0:3:57,21 --> 0:3:57,66
that


90
0:3:57,66 --> 0:3:58,56
they wouldn't say that


91
0:3:58,56 --> 0:4:2,109
boyce says a 'cause he's embarrassing
even to himself


92
0:4:2,109 --> 0:4:4,109
but he's gonna pretend to be comfortably


93
0:4:4,109 --> 0:4:5,889
many says


94
0:4:5,889 --> 0:4:9,899
much of my presidency was defined by
things but you didn't know so we want to


95
0:4:9,899 --> 0:4:15,379
have happened


96
0:4:15,379 --> 0:4:18,169
and by the way what those things are two
of those things with you getting elected


97
0:4:18,169 --> 0:4:19,409
in the first place


98
0:4:19,409 --> 0:4:21,93
or being present


99
0:4:21,93 --> 0:4:25,74
and what it is great excuses as always
is it's easy to forget what life was


100
0:4:25,74 --> 0:4:26,3
like


101
0:4:26,3 --> 0:4:27,979
when a decision was made


102
0:4:27,979 --> 0:4:28,999
regarding iraq


103
0:4:28,999 --> 0:4:29,82
in other words


104
0:4:29,82 --> 0:4:33,96
side we made the right decision but we
were in a panic and so uh... i don't


105
0:4:33,96 --> 0:4:37,18
know i i don't let racked


106
0:4:37,18 --> 0:4:41,229
i don't even believe that because of the
sixties he's got


107
0:4:41,229 --> 0:4:43,39
uh... but nonetheless


108
0:4:43,39 --> 0:4:45,179
that he goes back to his old ways


109
0:4:45,179 --> 0:4:47,76
welfare of the stranded that's when he
talked about


110
0:4:47,76 --> 0:4:50,949
the characters in the place including
george w_ bush


111
0:4:50,949 --> 0:4:54,97
he said what i give them is a certain on
the current confidence


112
0:4:54,97 --> 0:4:57,369
and hear the question here


113
0:4:57,369 --> 0:4:59,36
i'm katherine decisions were made


114
0:4:59,36 --> 0:5:1,529
the right way


115
0:5:1,529 --> 0:5:3,729
an alright yeah


116
0:5:3,729 --> 0:5:6,109
that he doesn't want you to be in that
quote


117
0:5:6,109 --> 0:5:9,65
he doesn't say was the right decision
caesar's and competent decisions


118
0:5:9,65 --> 0:5:11,29
were made


119
0:5:11,29 --> 0:5:12,929
the right way


120
0:5:12,929 --> 0:5:17,379
excel even he knows he knows we
desperately trying to fly can say


121
0:5:17,379 --> 0:5:21,209
nos five is fine double cab oligo
alitalia


122
0:5:21,209 --> 0:5:24,719
on top of our live it


123
0:5:24,719 --> 0:5:28,9
began if you're successful person why we
have to say uncover worldwide of course


124
0:5:28,9 --> 0:5:31,999
are double what you did bill gates are
you coming only bananas and of course i


125
0:5:31,999 --> 0:5:35,509
haven't several billion dollars
comparable look if it doesn't really is


126
0:5:35,509 --> 0:5:36,939
a dollars comfortable


127
0:5:36,939 --> 0:5:40,759
uh... and then bush inside once to drill
home


128
0:5:40,759 --> 0:5:42,76
so how about yourself to quote


129
0:5:42,76 --> 0:5:44,4
i thought it was black


130
0:5:44,4 --> 0:5:47,189
uh... dino george right now


131
0:5:47,189 --> 0:5:48,71
and let the good news is


132
0:5:48,71 --> 0:5:50,479
as you see from these quotes


133
0:5:50,479 --> 0:5:52,65
it's kinda roberta mop inside


134
0:5:52,65 --> 0:5:56,309
so you know we saw that he'd be like a
at whatever quantas a thousand people


135
0:5:56,309 --> 0:5:59,129
kill i screwed up the whole country


136
0:5:59,129 --> 0:6:2,139
and by the way i haven't even talked
about how there was a giant economic


137
0:6:2,139 --> 0:6:3,159
crash


138
0:6:3,159 --> 0:6:6,94
and outlook and we lost eight million
jobs in a crash right before you left


139
0:6:6,94 --> 0:6:9,6
but it was a disaster on top of a
disaster right


140
0:6:9,6 --> 0:6:10,699
but at least


141
0:6:10,699 --> 0:6:14,759
even as he's trying to deflect and in
his group the paintings of the year


142
0:6:14,759 --> 0:6:16,899
he realizes what a mess he was


143
0:6:16,899 --> 0:6:19,329
that water is pressing concerns today


144
0:6:19,329 --> 0:6:20,79
well the dallas morning news


145
0:6:20,79 --> 0:6:23,109

concerns


146
0:6:23,109 --> 0:6:26,309
was whether his hamstrings were ready
for a mountain bike


147
0:6:26,309 --> 0:6:28,18

he likes to play golf and attend texas
rangers games


152
0:6:38,929 --> 0:6:40,74
