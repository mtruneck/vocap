###23 EILENE: Hello.
###24 My name is Eilene.
###25 Come and see the red squirrels.
###26 
###33 Upstairs, into the bedroom.
###35 [LAUGHTER]
###37 [MEOW]
###39 
###45 EILENE: [CHUCKLES]
###46 Right.
###47 Get out, you.
###49 Red squirrels are, I think, they're reported to be the
###52 most intelligent of all the small rodent family.
###56 They are without question one of the cutest mammals we have
###59 in this country.
###59 There's no doubt about it-- if not the cutest.
###61 
###67 These squirrels were in a dray in a garden.
###70 We have terrible gales here.
###73 And the dray blew out of the tree.
###75 There were actually five of them.
###77 And when they went out to have a look, one was dead.
###79 And the other four were starting to
###81 crawl along the path.
###82 So they took them to the local vet in [INAUDIBLE].
###85 That actually them rang me and said, can you take them
###87 because they were going on holiday.
###89 Oh, look who joined in now.
###91 There you go.
###91 Now, how cute is that?
###93 How cute.
###95 
###97 There are three girls and one boy.
###98 So the boy is easy to distinguish.
###101 He's the runt of the litter.
###102 He's the smallest.
###103 All he wants to do is sleep.
###105 Whereas these three girls are hyper.
###107 
###119 Before-- oop, there he goes.
###124 Don't you dare jump in my coffee.
###127 FEMALE SPEAKER: So you're like mother--
###128 Mother Squirrel?
###129 EILENE: [CHUCKLES]
###130 At the moment, I'm Mommy.
###131 And I suppose, my husband's Daddy.
###133 For me, looking after any baby really is a joy.
###138 I think I must be a natural nurturer.
###140 And when my children left home and had grandchildren and then
###142 proceeded to live miles away, I just had nothing to nurture.
###147 The cutest thing about a red squirrel is I just have a
###150 thing about the little tufts that get on the ears.
###153 That really just melts my heart.
###155 
###162 There's a question mark over humanizing with wild animals.
###167 A lot of people will say that maybe we've got them too tame.
###172 But my feeling is that if they were with their mother, their
###175 mother would be nurturing them.
###177 And I just feel that when they're very young and
###179 vulnerable, nurturing won't do them any harm.
###183 
###192 Well, that is the most unprofessional squirrel
###195 feeding I have ever done.
###197 It's a very bittersweet moment the day they go.
###200 If they're fit and they're healthy,
###202 then you have to release.
###204 And they are all fit and healthy.
###206 And I can't, at the moment anyway, see any reason not to
###208 release them.
###209 I'm going to be so sad.
###210 [CHUCKLES]
###211 You have such a wonderful tail.
###215 And now, it's time to go to bed--
###218 tired, tired little squirrel.
###222 Oh, look.
###224 Time to go to bed.
###227 Yes, you can be Zebedee.
###230 There you go into your bed.
###233 There'll be a little bit of hodgy podgy, a bit of rough
###236 and tumble, and then eventually, silence.
