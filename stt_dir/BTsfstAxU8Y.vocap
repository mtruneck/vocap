###28 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: President Obama speaking last Friday about a shooting at Sandy Hook
###32 elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. We`re going to be focusing exclusively on
###36 that story today.
###38 There are a lot of questions about what happened on Friday. Right now, there aren`t very many
###43 answers. As people struggle to understand this tragedy, they are mourning the victims
###47 who lost their lives and looking for ways to honor those victims and support their families.
###53 President Obama ordered the flag at the U.S. Capitol building and at all U.S. Government
###57 buildings to be lowered to half-staff on Friday. Governors across the country asked for flags
###61 in their states to be lowered as well. Messages of sympathy for the shooting victims came
###66 in from all over the world. A lot of people shared similar thoughts on social media.
###71 In the community of Newtown where this happened, services and candle-light vigils like this
###76 one had been going on since Friday night. There has been an emotional reaction to the

###87 OBAMA: I know there is not a parent in America who doesn`t feel the same overwhelming grief
###94 that I do. The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids
###102 between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them - birthdays,
###122 graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and
###135 women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts
###141 are broken today for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children,
###150 and for the families of the adults who were lost.

###340 AZUZ: The shooting at Sandy Hook elementary is a story of violence and tragedy. It`s also
###361 a story of heroism. Certainly the police and emergency workers who responded to this attack,
###366 but especially the teachers and administrators at Sandy Hook and their actions last Friday.
###371 When one kindergarten teacher heard shots, she locked her classroom door, took her students
###376 to a safe area in the back of the room, and read to them in order to keep them calm. A
###381 first-grade teacher ushered her students into the class bathroom and then keep them there
###385 until the police came to evacuate them. Another first-grade teacher moved her students into
###390 a corner away from the door. When the gunman came into the room, the teacher stood in front

###424 are. And it`s in so many ways permissible to have those thoughts and those doubts about
###433 who we are and what we are and what community represents, but then we turn to understand,
###439 as we turn around this room, and recognizes our friends and our neighbors, those we have
