2
0:0:22,699 --> 0:0:26,46
NACHOUM: I'm originally from Israel and about
30 years ago, I came to the United States


3
0:0:26,46 --> 0:0:32,5
with the search of glory and who knows what
else. I really wanted to learn film and television.


4
0:0:32,5 --> 0:0:39,36
I went to New York University and I was accepted
from 350 people that tried to get in, in 1980,


5
0:0:39,36 --> 0:0:45,42
only 31 were accepted. Only later on I discovered
that the three instructor that was actually


6
0:0:45,42 --> 0:0:53,769
checking us out or evaluate our ability, they
were Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola and


7
0:0:53,769 --> 0:0:59,979
Woody Allen. I did not know any of them. In
the 80, none of us know any of them, right?


8
0:0:59,979 --> 0:1:4,35
Anyway, but that was a long story, that's
a long time ago, so I'll put this in perspective.


9
0:1:4,35 --> 0:1:9,65
I want to drive a taxi. That's what most Israelis
or foreigner, and today it will be Indian


10
0:1:9,65 --> 0:1:15,29
or Pakistanian, will do it. I want to drive
a taxi in New York for six months until eventually


11
0:1:15,29 --> 0:1:21,2
I have enough money and I started a company.
And what I wanted to do really is involve


12
0:1:21,2 --> 0:1:27,88
myself in the water and in underwater photography,
to tell the story about the ocean and what


13
0:1:27,88 --> 0:1:30,63
I knew about the ocean. During the time that
I was driving a taxi, I was driving a taxi


14
0:1:30,63 --> 0:1:37,109
at night and during the daytime, I was working
as a diving guide or divemaster at a dive


15
0:1:37,109 --> 0:1:43,34
shop in New York City. How many diver we have
here? Beautiful. How many of you are photographer


16
0:1:43,34 --> 0:1:47,88
also, holding a camera underwater? No, it
doesn't make any difference what camera. That's


17
0:1:47,88 --> 0:1:55,13
okay. I started from there. That's okay. That's
perfectly all right. So if I speak fast, it's


18
0:1:55,13 --> 0:2:1,579
only because I picked my English in New York
driving a taxi. So please forgive me. If my


19
0:2:1,579 --> 0:2:6,2
accent is difficult, I don't believe you because
the 30% of Silicon Valley is all Israelis


20
0:2:6,2 --> 0:2:10,83
anyway. So you already have been in business
with an Israeli one time or another. So to


21
0:2:10,83 --> 0:2:15,36
make the long story short, what I'm here,
really, is to be able to share with you the


22
0:2:15,36 --> 0:2:21,459
story and the privilege that America gave
me. I was privileged, or I am privileged perhaps,


23
0:2:21,459 --> 0:2:27,66
and visited over 131 nations all around the
world, and believe me, there is no country


24
0:2:27,66 --> 0:2:32,86
in the world like this country. No matter
how difficulty, no matter what the obstacles,


25
0:2:32,86 --> 0:2:36,989
the challenges we have, there is no country
in the world and there is no Constitution


26
0:2:36,989 --> 0:2:42,319
like we have in America. And no surprise,
we reached this level. I was able to master


27
0:2:42,319 --> 0:2:47,54
what you're going to see now only because
either the country, the substance of this


28
0:2:47,54 --> 0:2:52,689
country, the foundation and the people that
believe in my dream and participate and join


29
0:2:52,689 --> 0:2:58,239
me. As a photographer, there are two ways
to go about it; either you go, you create


30
0:2:58,239 --> 0:3:3,59
a portfolio, you send it to so many different
places to get work, or you go out and execute


31
0:3:3,59 --> 0:3:9,18
your own vision, my own dream. I chose the
last one. I've chosen to work after my own


32
0:3:9,18 --> 0:3:15,739
dream and make it available. However, in the
process, what became very clearly that institution,


33
0:3:15,739 --> 0:3:21,739
like magazine, television stations and network,
were concerned that they were not able to


34
0:3:21,739 --> 0:3:26,81
get their money's worth for my vision and
for my dream. So I went and I did it alone,


35
0:3:26,81 --> 0:3:32,349
trusting that people like yourself or other
in America will join me, will participate


36
0:3:32,349 --> 0:3:37,939
in what my dream is, because I'm not any different
than any one of you. We all have dreams. But


37
0:3:37,939 --> 0:3:43,9
some of you and me, may have seen our dreams
and we can joint venture. So, I put my expertise


38
0:3:43,9 --> 0:3:49,39
in the field. You put your expertise among
the pixels and all those nanotechnology. I


39
0:3:49,39 --> 0:3:59,549
put it out in the big animals. So let's go
and see what I have in store for you. What


40
0:3:59,549 --> 0:4:4,79
you're going to see today is anthology of
years and almost 30 years of having found,


41
0:4:4,79 --> 0:4:9,43
pushing the envelope, photographing on the
edge of wilderness, comfort and common sense.


42
0:4:9,43 --> 0:4:13,95
And I'm not saying that lightly. I desired
very much to come back again. And thank you,


43
0:4:13,95 --> 0:4:17,84
Vivian, again for the opportunity to work
with people like yourself and to share because


44
0:4:17,84 --> 0:4:22,74
you are on the edge of technology. Yes, you
have all the comfort in the world, but you're


45
0:4:22,74 --> 0:4:28,28
putting--you're pushing the envelope in what
you do and that is fascinating. How we connect


46
0:4:28,28 --> 0:4:31,75
some of the elements in your life, some of
the elements of my life, and some of the elements


47
0:4:31,75 --> 0:4:37,5
of somebody else and get--make a better life.
And the idea in my view and my presentation


48
0:4:37,5 --> 0:4:41,97
today is to be able to show you or to bring
to your knowledge not a specific trait, not


49
0:4:41,97 --> 0:4:48,9
a specific picture, but just the conglomerate
issue of what the big animal, what the position


50
0:4:48,9 --> 0:4:53,52
they have in our culture, and what we can
do, each one of our self, small world or big


51
0:4:53,52 --> 0:4:59,84
world, to protect them and to make them bet--to
make them available for future generation.


52
0:4:59,84 --> 0:5:4,28
And that will be just a glory for the big
animal. But that's how I--most of the time,


53
0:5:4,28 --> 0:5:8,1
an ugly shot like that is very unusual for
me. I could not even put it in my pants because


54
0:5:8,1 --> 0:5:15,1
I'm too fat by now. I'm not in the water for
long time ago. Not long enough. But only that's--this


55
0:5:15,1 --> 0:5:20,72
weekend, I'm leaving for Mexico, diving with
a great white for about two weeks. And that


56
0:5:20,72 --> 0:5:27,97
is my backyard. And all those places that
you see here are the places where images and


57
0:5:27,97 --> 0:5:33,61
the expedition that I'll conduct or I'm conducting
all around the world. So if you go some time


58
0:5:33,61 --> 0:5:39,58
sooner or later to my Web site, you'll be
able to see all those places one by one as


59
0:5:39,58 --> 0:5:46,9
they are relating. And we'll start with the
polar bear. I will--all of you all probably


60
0:5:46,9 --> 0:5:51,84
heard and knows what the polar bear plight
and all the story about the global warming.


61
0:5:51,84 --> 0:5:57,18
It is indeed taking effect and we don't know
what will be the next generation, the next


62
0:5:57,18 --> 0:6:3,13
step. However, what is important to know,
that the polar bear are ancestors of the grizzly


63
0:6:3,13 --> 0:6:8,37
and they are evolved into being polar bear
only 300,000 years ago. It is not something


64
0:6:8,37 --> 0:6:12,72
that take, like, sharks that live in the ocean
400 million years. Polar bear only evolved


65
0:6:12,72 --> 0:6:19,55
in the past 300,000 years ago. So there are
poses--the planet is on a continuous chase,


66
0:6:19,55 --> 0:6:24,75
continuous evolution, continuous--and we are
part of it right now. But to understand how


67
0:6:24,75 --> 0:6:29,7
the polar bear live and to get close to that,
that's what I do. And that's what we bring


68
0:6:29,7 --> 0:6:34,22
in people in small group, my team usually
about only four people when we go to look


69
0:6:34,22 --> 0:6:38,54
at the polar bear and will give you few opportunity.
So you ask me how close I was to the polar


70
0:6:38,54 --> 0:6:43,65
bear, almost as close as I am to the front
row right now. Understanding that every animal,


71
0:6:43,65 --> 0:6:49,15
like human beings, we have a pattern of behavior.
We have tools of how we protect, how we feed,


72
0:6:49,15 --> 0:6:53,96
how we make babies. Also, animals have the
same pattern, similar pattern. And the polar


73
0:6:53,96 --> 0:6:59,87
bear in this case, its pattern or its protection
is the sense of smell. So if the wind goes


74
0:6:59,87 --> 0:7:5,45
away from the polar bear, he will not smell
when we get close to it. The question is how


75
0:7:5,45 --> 0:7:9,9
often I can do it. It takes a long time. You
not--you'll not challenge the environment


76
0:7:9,9 --> 0:7:14,41
and to guess the environment, you just play
together with the wind until this happen.


77
0:7:14,41 --> 0:7:19,6
So, usually, a trip like that may take two
or three weeks, but we're able to achieve


78
0:7:19,6 --> 0:7:33,6
result as you see right now. Everything is
timely. Everything in the environment is about


79
0:7:33,6 --> 0:7:37,89
time. It's about knowing exactly when the
polar bear, or in this case, the animal, is


80
0:7:37,89 --> 0:7:44,82
on nurturing, when they are mating, when they're
migrating and when they are feeding. If we


81
0:7:44,82 --> 0:7:49,82
know--if I know all of these, that's when
I take the people with me on a trip for a


82
0:7:49,82 --> 0:7:54,71
small window of opportunity throughout the
year. That's why I don't repeat the same trips--the


83
0:7:54,71 --> 0:8:1,2
same trip each year. There are only one trip
of a kind every other month. But we'll be


84
0:8:1,2 --> 0:8:10,16
able to bring this kind of opportunity, this
kind of images. Vivian, can we ask somebody


85
0:8:10,16 --> 0:8:18,61
to turn some of the light down so maybe the
images will be seen better? I want also to


86
0:8:18,61 --> 0:8:22,59
take you underwater, not just top side. And
I want to share with you this. Anybody knows


87
0:8:22,59 --> 0:8:30,54
what is that? Anybody? Yes, that's very good,
Vivian. Thank you. That's the blue whale.


88
0:8:30,54 --> 0:8:37,89
Any--what do you know about the blue whale?
Anybody? Any idea? Big? How big?


89
0:8:37,89 --> 0:8:41,55
>> Biggest in the world.
>> NACHOUM: The biggest animal ever live on


90
0:8:41,55 --> 0:8:46,67
the planet. Bigger than any dinosaurs. How
big is it really? How long? How long?


91
0:8:46,67 --> 0:8:51,11
>> Sixty feet.
>> NACHOUM: Sixty feet. Any other number?


92
0:8:51,11 --> 0:8:54,76
>> Hundred.
>> NACHOUM: Hundred-feet long, yes. And eat


93
0:8:54,76 --> 0:9:1,36
only plankton. There used to be about over
a quarter of a million blue whales on your


94
0:9:1,36 --> 0:9:8,7
planet. Today, how many left? Anybody knows?
Hardly 12,000; 7,000 of them in the southern


95
0:9:8,7 --> 0:9:13,42
hemisphere and about 5,000 on the northern
hemisphere. And from the 5,000 on the northern


96
0:9:13,42 --> 0:9:20,5
hemisphere, about 3,000--2,500 to 3,000 along
the Coast of Mexico, back of California, California


97
0:9:20,5 --> 0:9:28,2
and Washington State. Why? Because we have
the mammal protection law in the United States


98
0:9:28,2 --> 0:9:35,92
that also extend into Mexico and extend further
up to Canada. So, protection. And when we


99
0:9:35,92 --> 0:9:41,33
apply the protection, it's very helpful to
support the existence of the animal and especially


100
0:9:41,33 --> 0:9:46,51
the big one. And that's where you see really
how big is this animal. That's aerial photography,


101
0:9:46,51 --> 0:10:1,21
of course. The blow of the blue whale reach
almost over 30 feet, 10-meter tall. Anybody


102
0:10:1,21 --> 0:10:14,39
knows what is that? It's beluga whales. What
are called the canary of the sea. And what


103
0:10:14,39 --> 0:10:17,89
is that? What is that?
>> A killer whale.


104
0:10:17,89 --> 0:10:25,34
>> NACHOUM: There is no killer whale. There's
no such things. That is how we use the language


105
0:10:25,34 --> 0:10:31,27
and how we are mystify things and how we create
bad reputation to many of the animal because


106
0:10:31,27 --> 0:10:39,82
of lack of knowledge. Fear. The enemy of fear,
number one, is lack of knowledge. Orcas are


107
0:10:39,82 --> 0:10:44,93
actually dolphins. They're not even whales.
There are in truth, dolphins. The name "killer


108
0:10:44,93 --> 0:10:50,22
whale" have been adopted to the orca only
because the Englishmen that came to translate


109
0:10:50,22 --> 0:10:56,13
the manifest of the Spanish galleons of the
14th, 15th century could not give it any other


110
0:10:56,13 --> 0:11:1,65
name because the Spaniard and the Portuguese,
what they wrote in the manifest, they're looking


111
0:11:1,65 --> 0:11:6,42
at an animal that's actually killing other
whales. So they call it "killer whale." They


112
0:11:6,42 --> 0:11:10,96
did not give it a name yet, orca. Only later
on when we start to do research, when we start


113
0:11:10,96 --> 0:11:18,26
to develop university along the coast of Canada,
Washington, Norway and other parts of the


114
0:11:18,26 --> 0:11:22,32
world, then we give them name. Today, we know
there are about five different species of


115
0:11:22,32 --> 0:11:27,56
orca in the wild. Two of them still unidentified
in Antarctica and the other three that we


116
0:11:27,56 --> 0:11:32,27
know of are resident, transient and nomad.
And each one of them is different into where


117
0:11:32,27 --> 0:11:38,24
which how they behave, which how--their social
formation and how they feed. Those images


118
0:11:38,24 --> 0:11:45,31
are from Norway where we see mostly, actually,
transient--not transient--we see resident


119
0:11:45,31 --> 0:11:51,48
orcas. Resident orca feed mostly on fish and
there are a group of about 12 to 15 of them.


120
0:11:51,48 --> 0:11:58,42
But the--all of the citation, the dolphin
and whales, are actually led by females. And


121
0:11:58,42 --> 0:12:5,89
same thing with the orcas. And there is not
even one, not even one, accident ever happened


122
0:12:5,89 --> 0:12:11,73
in the wild between orca and mankind. The
only time there was an accident, anybody knows


123
0:12:11,73 --> 0:12:13,54
where?
>> SeaWorld.


124
0:12:13,54 --> 0:12:21,89
>> NACHOUM: Bravo. So let's close them because
that's bad reputation unnecessarily. And they


125
0:12:21,89 --> 0:12:26,35
play without the need to have trainer and
whistle and all kind of toy. They play freely


126
0:12:26,35 --> 0:12:35,89
in the wild. That was a moment of really unforgettable
moment in the history. In my case, being in


127
0:12:35,89 --> 0:12:39,89
the wild for as long as I've been, and all
of a sudden we had sunset in one hand, moonrise


128
0:12:39,89 --> 0:12:43,9
on the other hand and the orca just passed
in--under the mountain and in front of the


129
0:12:43,9 --> 0:12:53,82
moon in Norway. Anybody knows where Norway
is? Of course. We have Google Earth. And that's


130
0:12:53,82 --> 0:13:3,339
the beauty of the sunset together with the
orcas. And anybody knows what is that? What?


131
0:13:3,339 --> 0:13:15,92
Great whale? What else? Humpback whales, humpback
whales. Only 16,000 of them today are in the


132
0:13:15,92 --> 0:13:21,9
wild [INDISTINCT]. How we know all of them,
I don't know for sure, but I can tell you


133
0:13:21,9 --> 0:13:26,62
quite from research and from all the environmental
organization and the tech place, but especially


134
0:13:26,62 --> 0:13:32,6
after the [INDISTINCT] of the Soviet Union,
we were able to get into the record of the


135
0:13:32,6 --> 0:13:38,24
Soviets, of the Finland, of the Norwegian,
and the Iceland fishermen from the early part


136
0:13:38,24 --> 0:13:43,22
of the previous century and then we'll be
able to put all the number together how many


137
0:13:43,22 --> 0:13:47,43
they have actually hunted. Not just the number
they gave at a time publicly but get into


138
0:13:47,43 --> 0:13:52,5
the record and only then find out really how
many at least they have hunted. In addition


139
0:13:52,5 --> 0:13:58,0
to what we have today, the science and researcher
came to approximate numbers. And that is the


140
0:13:58,0 --> 0:14:3,47
number I'll mentioned. Today, we have more
accurate information about what's left in


141
0:14:3,47 --> 0:14:9,339
the world. Again, not specifically, but much
more accurate in a 10% to 20% margin of error,


142
0:14:9,339 --> 0:14:14,57
but we have about 16,000 to 20,000 compared
to 500,000 and this is a result of hunting.


143
0:14:14,57 --> 0:14:19,7
And today, there is no reason for that whatsoever.
Although, the Norwegian and the Icelandic


144
0:14:19,7 --> 0:14:27,47
and the Russian or the [INDISTINCT]. We can
swim with them just like with the humpback,


145
0:14:27,47 --> 0:14:32,89
just like with the orcas, just like with,
you know, close with the polar bear. Understanding,


146
0:14:32,89 --> 0:14:40,12
we can also actually snorkel. Actually, no
scuba, no BC, no weight, just with our own


147
0:14:40,12 --> 0:14:46,26
air, be able to snorkel with them because
snorkeling is perhaps the best activity to


148
0:14:46,26 --> 0:14:51,48
meet the big animal. Just like for us men,
be gentle is the easiest way to get to any


149
0:14:51,48 --> 0:14:57,529
woman if we want to--nobody's laughing anymore--simply
because big animals are most vulnerable when


150
0:14:57,529 --> 0:15:5,6
they are on the surface. They're on the surface
because they need to breathe. And when they're


151
0:15:5,6 --> 0:15:10,47
there, that's the only time where we can really
match and get close to them. And the moment


152
0:15:10,47 --> 0:15:15,42
they get to the water, they took their breath
and they went underwater, after the first


153
0:15:15,42 --> 0:15:18,69
five feet there is no way for us humans ever
to reach to get them because they are much


154
0:15:18,69 --> 0:15:23,47
faster, stronger than us. But when they are
on the surface, then that's all a question


155
0:15:23,47 --> 0:15:28,74
of timing and coordination. That's why any
of the expedition I lead, the photographic


156
0:15:28,74 --> 0:15:33,49
expedition, for the animals, are with small
group. It was only four to six people only


157
0:15:33,49 --> 0:15:38,88
to get the maximum result and the ability
not to affect the animal and not to really


158
0:15:38,88 --> 0:15:44,2
impose on them. Only two people at a time
as we descend to the water, so the animal


159
0:15:44,2 --> 0:15:50,71
will be interactive with us like in these
images. Or like with this image, this is a


160
0:15:50,71 --> 0:15:56,589
single. Among the whales, the Humpback Whale
is the only one--the male actually sing to


161
0:15:56,589 --> 0:16:2,209
attract the female toward them. And in the
water as I was mentioning before, the water


162
0:16:2,209 --> 0:16:8,7
are three or 800 times denser than air. So,
let me ask you that, where will be the best


163
0:16:8,7 --> 0:16:19,6
acoustic place in the world? Carnegie Hall,
the Opera House in Sydney, or underwater?


164
0:16:19,6 --> 0:16:23,529
Underwater. Three hundred sixty degrees, 800
times denser, any vibration that this single


165
0:16:23,529 --> 0:16:27,99
humpback whale will do your heart will pump
together with the music. It will be actually


166
0:16:27,99 --> 0:16:34,2
echoing in the vacuum or in the air space
that you have in your lung. It's absolutely


167
0:16:34,2 --> 0:16:40,39
stunning. Whale mother and calf. Again, as
I mentioned, it's all a question of timing


168
0:16:40,39 --> 0:16:45,35
to know in all animal--and you see that the
pattern will repeat itself, either among the


169
0:16:45,35 --> 0:16:48,91
orcas, among the polar bear, and among the
humpback whale, it's about feeding, about


170
0:16:48,91 --> 0:16:53,75
migrating and about nurturing, knowing the
right timing to be able to bring this kind


171
0:16:53,75 --> 0:16:59,73
of encounters between you and the animals.
And the animals who come very close and anybody--we


172
0:16:59,73 --> 0:17:4,97
said that we have seven photographers here.
This is a very, very wide angle lens. As a


173
0:17:4,97 --> 0:17:8,24
matter of fact, this is a fisheye lens, that
means that I was less than one feet away from


174
0:17:8,24 --> 0:17:11,169
this juvenile humpback whale that came in.
It was very curios what am I doing in the


175
0:17:11,169 --> 0:17:21,399
water. And that is a breach, 40 ton of animal
lifts itself out of the water and we don't


176
0:17:21,399 --> 0:17:27,449
know why. There is no reason that human can
develop--and we say that communication, removing


177
0:17:27,449 --> 0:17:36,429
parasite--we really don't know why. But they
can do it and they're doing it. And that's


178
0:17:36,429 --> 0:17:43,73
the classic of the tail of the humpback whale,
dripping water in Alaska. Well, moving rather


179
0:17:43,73 --> 0:17:50,84
along for another creature of a lot of excitement
and colors. And those are the dolphins. There


180
0:17:50,84 --> 0:17:58,39
are about three dozen different species of
dolphin in the wild and those are--these one


181
0:17:58,39 --> 0:18:5,98
in particular are--those are the bottlenose
dolphin in Galapagos. This is the common dolphin,


182
0:18:5,98 --> 0:18:11,19
the Atlantic common dolphin in South Africa.
Of course, this is the bait ball where the


183
0:18:11,19 --> 0:18:21,879
dolphins are feeding on. And what is that?
What's that? Go ahead. No, no, go ahead. It's


184
0:18:21,879 --> 0:18:29,889
good. What do you think is that?
>> [INDISTINCT]


185
0:18:29,889 --> 0:18:29,889
>> NACHOUM: [INDISTINCT], what else?
>> Sailfish.


186
0:18:29,889 --> 0:18:33,639
>> NACHOUM: Sailfish, what else? It is indeed
a sailfish. There are about seven--there are


187
0:18:33,639 --> 0:18:39,769
seven species of what they call the billfish
family. There are swordfish, there are blue


188
0:18:39,769 --> 0:18:45,49
marlin, there are marlin, there are stripe
marlin, white marlin, sailfish and maybe one


189
0:18:45,49 --> 0:18:49,809
more that I forgot at the moment. However,
there wasn't any pictures of sailfish until


190
0:18:49,809 --> 0:18:57,23
about four years ago. Anybody knows what happened
four years ago? [INDISTINCT] remember? It


191
0:18:57,23 --> 0:19:2,409
was the first time that both stories of the
Blue Planet and the images of the--of this


192
0:19:2,409 --> 0:19:7,82
sailfish and I was the one that actually took
them out there into Mexico to dive actually


193
0:19:7,82 --> 0:19:12,519
off the [INDISTINCT] 15 minutes off Cancun
into the water of Isla Mujeres. If anybody


194
0:19:12,519 --> 0:19:19,279
been there will know. It's a beautiful little
island, very rustic it was at the time, but


195
0:19:19,279 --> 0:19:24,8
today it's becoming almost like a hub after
Cancun because it become very popular among


196
0:19:24,8 --> 0:19:28,229
the fisherman and among the diver. After [INDISTINCT]
about, everybody plunking out there. Yes?


197
0:19:28,229 --> 0:19:30,95
>> How big is that?
>> NACHOUM: The fish is about nine feet long


198
0:19:30,95 --> 0:19:39,85
and the bill is about one-third of the whole
fish. It is the fastest fish in the ocean.


199
0:19:39,85 --> 0:19:47,519
It clocked at over 75 miles per hour, faster
than a cheetah on the land. It is fantastic.


200
0:19:47,519 --> 0:19:52,769
But the only time to catch those images, and
the one that you see next, is when they're


201
0:19:52,769 --> 0:19:59,47
actually coming by--they're coming into Mexico
to this particular part of the water in a


202
0:19:59,47 --> 0:20:5,58
particular time of the year, in January, February,
to feed on the Brazilian sardine. And here


203
0:20:5,58 --> 0:20:10,36
as you see is the bait ball of the sardine.
Nobody knew. And, you know, a lot of fisherman


204
0:20:10,36 --> 0:20:14,619
going for many, many, many years, [INDISTINCT]
and the rest, have been catching those sailfish


205
0:20:14,619 --> 0:20:20,179
and those marlin in Cuba, in Mexico, in Peru,
everywhere else. But hardly anybody until


206
0:20:20,179 --> 0:20:26,769
four years ago--actually, not hardly, it's
clearly, nobody with a camera went to the


207
0:20:26,769 --> 0:20:31,289
water about four or five years ago--five years
ago when I went, I called the BBC and when


208
0:20:31,289 --> 0:20:34,96
they did Blue Planet, they call [INDISTINCT]
okay, put us together with the story and we


209
0:20:34,96 --> 0:20:42,59
set up the set-up. And that is the evidence.
We told you about bait ball. Bait ball happened


210
0:20:42,59 --> 0:20:46,82
many different parts of the world all the
time, especially in the remote island. In


211
0:20:46,82 --> 0:20:48,85
this case, off Galapagos. Anybody been in
Galapagos before besides Vivian? You, have


212
0:20:48,85 --> 0:20:50,99
you been all the way in Darwin and Wolf?
>> No, no.


213
0:20:50,99 --> 0:20:52,679
>> NACHOUM: No? Then most don't--northern
island.


214
0:20:52,679 --> 0:20:55,509
>> I don't know.
>> NAHCOUM: You don't know. There is two island


215
0:20:55,509 --> 0:21:0,619
up north of the equator of [INDISTINCT] called
Darwin and Wolf. The middle of nowhere, 600


216
0:21:0,619 --> 0:21:9,179
mile from any land and 100 mile north of Galapagos
itself, they are a part of Galapagos. And


217
0:21:9,179 --> 0:21:16,44
they are [INDISTINCT] there's no land. They
need to feed. They need food. And the food


218
0:21:16,44 --> 0:21:24,389
is in the water, so all with sea birds. And
when you watch well enough, you'll be able


219
0:21:24,389 --> 0:21:31,6
to see eventually the birds feeding and then
the tuna feeding underwater on a bait ball.


220
0:21:31,6 --> 0:21:55,809
And those are actually yellowtail tuna [INDISTINCT]
fish actually use its bill, like the baseball


221
0:21:55,809 --> 0:22:0,779
bat used in a baseball game. They actually
hit the fish with the bill. They move it like


222
0:22:0,779 --> 0:22:4,32
that all the time into the school. But only
one sailfish at a time. All the other sailfish


223
0:22:4,32 --> 0:22:10,47
will wait until one finish and then it come
the second round of like it [INDISTINCT] moving


224
0:22:10,47 --> 0:22:18,669
very, very fast. And just like this one. Anybody
heard about the BBC Wildlife Competition of


225
0:22:18,669 --> 0:22:22,539
the Year? The Photographer of the Year? So
about three years ago, this picture took the


226
0:22:22,539 --> 0:22:28,359
first place in the underwater photography.
This was the moment as--again, very fast fish,


227
0:22:28,359 --> 0:22:36,609
very fast action. And to catch it when he
took the bait or to take the bait in its mouth,


228
0:22:36,609 --> 0:22:41,639
it was very--I was, I guess very lucky to
be able to capture it and bring it alive.


229
0:22:41,639 --> 0:22:47,279
And this picture taken actually from the side
of my shoulder. That's no manipulation and


230
0:22:47,279 --> 0:22:54,44
no Photoshop-ing and nothing, any other elements.
It's just the way it is, captured in camera


231
0:22:54,44 --> 0:23:0,69
at one time. And after everybody has seen
the bait and you see the blood that actually


232
0:23:0,69 --> 0:23:12,2
already--the fish already bleeding between
the two parts of the bill. What is that? Great


233
0:23:12,2 --> 0:23:20,789
white. What does it do? Breaching out of the
water. It was very--it was a situation that


234
0:23:20,789 --> 0:23:26,139
was up until seven or eight years ago, nobody
knew of--or if we knew about it, nobody reported


235
0:23:26,139 --> 0:23:31,149
or did anything about it. This actually happened
only in South Africa. The great white breach


236
0:23:31,149 --> 0:23:37,119
also other places but not to such extraordinary
behavior. The reason why exactly we don't


237
0:23:37,119 --> 0:23:42,109
know, but the purpose of the great white breaching
is because they are looking after there actually


238
0:23:42,109 --> 0:23:48,97
seals that moving out from the island in early
part of the morning. So in order to do that,


239
0:23:48,97 --> 0:23:53,95
after a year or two or three observing that,
it become clear that the great white, just


240
0:23:53,95 --> 0:24:0,529
like all other predators, like all other master
of their ability are very conservative animal


241
0:24:0,529 --> 0:24:5,279
despite their power, despite the uniqueness
ability that nature gave to them. They are


242
0:24:5,279 --> 0:24:12,33
not a man eater. They are not eat anything
they see. They are very methodical. There


243
0:24:12,33 --> 0:24:20,389
is an island just off Cape Town called Seal's
Island, about 45,000 to 60,000 seals on it.


244
0:24:20,389 --> 0:24:25,19
Come January and they give birth, the seal
population give birth. The population rise


245
0:24:25,19 --> 0:24:31,809
to about almost 60,000. The adult will have
to go to sea to bring more fish for them for


246
0:24:31,809 --> 0:24:37,84
food. And [INDISTINCT] July, this is where
the most migration of a big and the bigger


247
0:24:37,84 --> 0:24:43,249
seals go out to sea. The shark will arrive
around Seal Island around May, June and wait


248
0:24:43,249 --> 0:24:46,85
for the opportunity. Seal's Island, it is
relatively deep. If you go to the water there


249
0:24:46,85 --> 0:24:53,9
is a steep cliff, it goes to about 40, 60
feet before it reach the bottom and that's


250
0:24:53,9 --> 0:24:59,929
how they rise out of the surface. The great
white patrol around it, especially in the


251
0:24:59,929 --> 0:25:5,59
morning hours. And exactly like all surfer.
When surfer go to sea? Early morning and late


252
0:25:5,59 --> 0:25:12,19
afternoon. When the shark operate? Early morning,
late afternoon. Why? The sun hardly rise over


253
0:25:12,19 --> 0:25:16,84
the horizon, the angle of the sun over the
horizon is the angle of penetration into the


254
0:25:16,84 --> 0:25:23,419
water, the light. So the lesser the angle,
or the more angle, lesser, lesser activity.


255
0:25:23,419 --> 0:25:30,59
But a shark can see there is a light on the
surface, the shark [INDISTINCT] on the surface.


256
0:25:30,59 --> 0:25:36,9
The seal cannot see the shark underwater because
there's not enough light. Beside the shark


257
0:25:36,9 --> 0:25:42,59
on the back of it, it's dark over like the
water, totally stealth. The shark will go


258
0:25:42,59 --> 0:25:51,6
straight up 40 feet to accelerate and to catch
the seal. The seal don't know what hit it.


259
0:25:51,6 --> 0:25:53,399
Come the light, eight, nine o'clock in the
morning, the operation or the nature went


260
0:25:53,399 --> 0:26:2,899
to sleep, until later on four or five o'clock
in the evening again. In order to be able


261
0:26:2,899 --> 0:26:7,729
to do that, we have to emulate the behavior
of the seal and we tow behind [INDISTINCT]


262
0:26:7,729 --> 0:26:11,979
a dummy, a plastic or a rubber dummy, about
20 feet away from the boat and wait for the


263
0:26:11,979 --> 0:26:16,539
moment for the shark to jump out and here
you go. So three years ago in the BBC competition,


264
0:26:16,539 --> 0:26:26,229
the Photographer of the Year, this also had
the first place in animal behavior. And [INDISTINCT]


265
0:26:26,229 --> 0:26:31,229
get close to the animal and to bring really
the behavior be able to put almost--not almost,


266
0:26:31,229 --> 0:26:38,669
I put actually--the camera was in the mouth
of the shark and take it away and be able


267
0:26:38,669 --> 0:26:40,519
to bring the images back. Because understanding
how the shark operate, and that's because


268
0:26:40,519 --> 0:26:45,94
of this understanding, I, next week as Vivian
knows and hopefully she'll join me next year--when


269
0:26:45,94 --> 0:26:52,389
we go to Mexico and there is a great white,
there is one thing that all operator do continuously


270
0:26:52,389 --> 0:27:0,509
including Discovery, we do the very unethical
things. It is challenging the shark, actually


271
0:27:0,509 --> 0:27:3,239
teasing them and irritating them, by putting
blood and chum in the water to take them to


272
0:27:3,239 --> 0:27:12,279
the camera. But if you don't put chum or blood
and not take it away from them, the shark


273
0:27:12,279 --> 0:27:13,889
will care less and they'll swim around me,
just like I'm a piece of nothing in the water.


274
0:27:13,889 --> 0:27:22,919
And you don't believe me, am I right? Let's
see. That's the animal that was captured in


275
0:27:22,919 --> 0:27:27,609
our imagination. That's the animal that the
media wanted to use so badly. That's the image,


276
0:27:27,609 --> 0:27:34,72
Discovery have used this exact image. In '93,
they used this as a poster. They turned it


277
0:27:34,72 --> 0:27:39,979
vertical, they make it a poster and all over
the front of buses and all over New York,


278
0:27:39,979 --> 0:27:45,349
California and Texas and Chicago to promote
the Shark Week. But the truth of the matter


279
0:27:45,349 --> 0:27:51,2
is that we don't use blood because this is
the prey, what you see here, are the seals.


280
0:27:51,2 --> 0:27:56,519
Well, that's what they feed on. If we don't
use chum and blood in the water, we can sit


281
0:27:56,519 --> 0:28:6,799
on the edge of comfort and against common
sense because there is nothing to do with


282
0:28:6,799 --> 0:28:13,919
what we've been feed. We can swim openly,
freely, safely with a great white. However,


283
0:28:13,919 --> 0:28:22,2
if we'll not be too bravado or too macho's
or imposing our superiority, perhaps superiority


284
0:28:22,2 --> 0:28:28,59
over the wilderness. On the contrary, living
with the wilderness like making love to nature,


285
0:28:28,59 --> 0:28:37,22
make love with nature, nature will be able
to show us some most amazing moments just


286
0:28:37,22 --> 0:28:46,7
like this. And this is not again, no touched
and not expended and not been blown, it is


287
0:28:46,7 --> 0:28:52,72
over 50 millimeter lens. Especially I use
this lens in order to bring the image of the


288
0:28:52,72 --> 0:28:57,83
shark and distort it. All photographers know,
and if you don't know, of anytime you go to


289
0:28:57,83 --> 0:29:3,669
a movie and you see anything, lenses have
the ability actually to distort the images.


290
0:29:3,669 --> 0:29:8,229
There is depth of field. There is shallow
depth of field, a [INDISTINCT] depth of field


291
0:29:8,229 --> 0:29:14,369
and distort the images because of what they
call the false perspective. But when we take


292
0:29:14,369 --> 0:29:20,149
a 50 millimeter lens, which is almost like
exactly what we see in our own eyes, we'll


293
0:29:20,149 --> 0:29:26,909
be able to get this particular images. And
that's a picture that one of my client took


294
0:29:26,909 --> 0:29:33,109
of me swimming with a great white last year.
Face to face as I'm closest to the people


295
0:29:33,109 --> 0:29:41,46
on the front row. And that's the image I got
in my camera. And I allow the shark to come


296
0:29:41,46 --> 0:29:46,759
even closer toward me. This is another photographer.
That's even close, half the distance between


297
0:29:46,759 --> 0:30:0,58
us two. And that's the image I got then. So
if the movie created such--how do you call


298
0:30:0,58 --> 0:30:7,22
it, memories in our mind, I have to do--to
try to do the same thing, rather the opposite,


299
0:30:7,22 --> 0:30:13,249
remove this negative and be able to share
with you the knowledge how this happened and


300
0:30:13,249 --> 0:30:17,419
how to avoid it, or what to participate if
you want to participate in something that


301
0:30:17,419 --> 0:30:22,71
has the positive effect on your life, on the
life of the animal, and the life of nature.


302
0:30:22,71 --> 0:30:26,95
But not only to the great white, we come even
closer with this. Anybody know what is that?


303
0:30:26,95 --> 0:30:33,509
>> The whale shark.
>> NACHOUM: The whale shark. How big is the


304
0:30:33,509 --> 0:30:34,309
whale shark?
>> Huge.


305
0:30:34,309 --> 0:30:38,899
>> NACHOUM: How huge is huge? It's not as
huge as Google. But how huge is huge? It's


306
0:30:38,899 --> 0:30:46,59
about 40, 45 feet long. One of the three or
four different species of shark that feed


307
0:30:46,59 --> 0:30:53,7
only on plankton and it's the largest of all
the shark species. So it does not have to


308
0:30:53,7 --> 0:30:59,929
eat meat in order to be large. You can eat
plankton and you are the largest. Which is


309
0:30:59,929 --> 0:31:3,57
bring another problem altogether, it is not
necessarily the place right now, but the over


310
0:31:3,57 --> 0:31:9,879
fishing of plankton in the southern ocean
in and around Antarctica by the country like


311
0:31:9,879 --> 0:31:17,49
the Soviet Union, China and other, and they
use that mostly for fertilization and food


312
0:31:17,49 --> 0:31:23,649
for their animal stocks. That is becoming
a problem because they are competing practically


313
0:31:23,649 --> 0:31:28,519
with the albatross which are in decline and
of course with all the large whale, the blues,


314
0:31:28,519 --> 0:31:32,349
the sei, the fin whale, the humpback, and
all of the other whale that actually go to


315
0:31:32,349 --> 0:31:35,929
the Antarctica to feed during the summertime,
in Antarctica summer time, our winter time.


316
0:31:35,929 --> 0:31:42,21
And here is the example of the size of this
mouth of this animal together with the driver


317
0:31:42,21 --> 0:31:51,149
just beside that. It could swallow it very
easily but it does not really happen. We can


318
0:31:51,149 --> 0:31:56,9
imagine whatever we want to imagine. And,
of course, these stories and this stigma of


319
0:31:56,9 --> 0:32:0,929
this very prehistoric look like of them, of
the hammerhead sharks, out of Galapagos. When


320
0:32:0,929 --> 0:32:5,509
you see them in great numbers, sometime hundreds
together, but very--and then unusual shape


321
0:32:5,509 --> 0:32:13,409
of the head, and the eyes all together by
the side, but they come very, very close to


322
0:32:13,409 --> 0:32:18,479
the reef and they are waiting for their--actually
for the butterflyfish to come and to clean


323
0:32:18,479 --> 0:32:23,33
them and they open mouths like--just like
we see it in a barber shop waiting for the


324
0:32:23,33 --> 0:32:33,849
opportunity to somebody come clean and give
us a good time. There you are. But that's


325
0:32:33,849 --> 0:32:37,44
the drama that you're looking for. That's
the event, the phenomenal event, that you're


326
0:32:37,44 --> 0:32:44,369
looking for. The schooling Hammerhead, sometime
hundred to a thousand. It could be three,


327
0:32:44,369 --> 0:32:48,44
five, sometime up to seven, eight minutes
parade of those school and they are in the


328
0:32:48,44 --> 0:32:59,419
distance between me and the third--the second
or the third row from here. Or this, or this.


329
0:32:59,419 --> 0:33:1,879
Anybody knows what is that?
>> Ray.


330
0:33:1,879 --> 0:33:7,399
>> NACHOUM: Ray, what kind of ray? They are
mobula rays. They are not mantas, they are


331
0:33:7,399 --> 0:33:11,429
mobula rays. They are smaller in size and
they feed also on plankton and they move in


332
0:33:11,429 --> 0:33:16,929
a big crowd. In this case, about 40 or 50
of them at one time off the coast of Galapagos


333
0:33:16,929 --> 0:33:22,429
Island again. And this is the manta ray. This
is the Oceanic manta ray or the giant manta


334
0:33:22,429 --> 0:33:35,82
ray, almost 20 feet from wing tip to wing
tip. And this is, not a sailfish, what is


335
0:33:35,82 --> 0:33:45,84
that? Striped marlin. A striped, yes. It's
a marlin and there's--it's that marlin about


336
0:33:45,84 --> 0:33:50,759
almost 12 feet, about 2 feet larger than the
sailfish. And again, the bill is about one-third


337
0:33:50,759 --> 0:33:56,649
of the fish, the fish length. They are as
fast as a sailfish and they are--you can find


338
0:33:56,649 --> 0:34:2,82
them in exactly opposite side of Mexico. If
the sailfish was found out in the Caribbean,


339
0:34:2,82 --> 0:34:9,55
then the marlin we would find out in the Atlanta--in
the Pacific of Cabo San Lucas. And let's see


340
0:34:9,55 --> 0:34:16,389
how the marlin feed. The marlin feed a lit
bit different than the sailfish. And as you


341
0:34:16,389 --> 0:34:22,53
see, as the marlin here coming in to the school,
actually he use his bill like we use the chopsticks.


342
0:34:22,53 --> 0:34:31,289
Anybody knows how to eat with chopsticks?
You remove one sushi at a time, right? Look


343
0:34:31,289 --> 0:34:32,45
at the fish--the picture is not very clear,
unfortunately, but in--on the edge of the


344
0:34:32,45 --> 0:34:46,179
bill, you'll see one of the sardine and then
it took it. It's the last day of the life


345
0:34:46,179 --> 0:34:57,869
of this sardine. It is fun being in the water.
It's joy. The water actually will carry you.


346
0:34:57,869 --> 0:35:4,0
As long as you just not fight with it, just
let the water do what the water does and get


347
0:35:4,0 --> 0:35:9,47
along with it, the water will just carry you
like being in the womb of the mother. Seventy


348
0:35:9,47 --> 0:35:16,109
percent or more of our planet is ocean. Seventy
percent of the planet is giving us over 50%


349
0:35:16,109 --> 0:35:24,119
of the oxygen that we breathe on. And we polluted
it galore. Anybody--most of you heard about


350
0:35:24,119 --> 0:35:27,809
the plastic island that we have somewhere
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean all the


351
0:35:27,809 --> 0:35:32,779
way throughout Japan. And all the pollution
that we throw into the water, factories from


352
0:35:32,779 --> 0:35:37,539
all over the country, including United States,
and all the other developing country, we have


353
0:35:37,539 --> 0:35:41,859
to do something about it because there is
no place as beautiful as--look at these images.


354
0:35:41,859 --> 0:35:46,99
Look at this coloration. Look at the animal
that's suffering, animal that we can relate


355
0:35:46,99 --> 0:35:53,95
to. They are our size, a turtle, we can relate
to one to one. They are happy to be where


356
0:35:53,95 --> 0:35:59,809
they are. How can we continue contaminate,
or really continue avoid playful with them?


357
0:35:59,809 --> 0:36:5,289
They are part of a playground. This is--I
showed you the world of the--the map of the


358
0:36:5,289 --> 0:36:9,72
world, that's my playground. I don't have
to go to Yosemite only, the ocean, the rest


359
0:36:9,72 --> 0:36:16,17
of the world is our playground. And they are
beautiful things out there to play with. Like


360
0:36:16,17 --> 0:36:28,589
those seals in the kelp of South Africa or
the narwhal out in the high Arctic or the


361
0:36:28,589 --> 0:36:37,349
pink dolphin from the Amazon river. Even the
anaconda. I know the movie create such drama


362
0:36:37,349 --> 0:36:43,21
and such a--it's a piece of cake, fortunately,
understanding that anaconda doesn't feed underwater.


363
0:36:43,21 --> 0:36:55,88
They feed on the land. But they don't feed
underwater. And then would do nothing. We


364
0:36:55,88 --> 0:37:5,65
swim with them, 24-feet long animal. This
is how we find some of the animals in the


365
0:37:5,65 --> 0:37:11,2
ocean. We cannot see into the water but we
can use the same understanding that the old


366
0:37:11,2 --> 0:37:15,849
generation had. We don't need sophistication
and we don't need the Google Ocean to find


367
0:37:15,849 --> 0:37:25,72
out where are the service because Google Ocean
doesn't know unless I tell them. And that's


368
0:37:25,72 --> 0:37:31,24
what happen when you look from the surface
into the water, half over, half under. The


369
0:37:31,24 --> 0:37:36,16
birds on top, the sailfish on the bottom,
and between them are the bait ball or are


370
0:37:36,16 --> 0:37:47,819
the sardines. Going to Antarctica. We're not
necessarily going to be like Titanic. It happened


371
0:37:47,819 --> 0:37:53,16
once in history. We learned the lessons. We
dive under the ice, which is like diving in


372
0:37:53,16 --> 0:38:6,18
a palace. And we see these amazing vistas
of the continent that's totally frozen. It


373
0:38:6,18 --> 0:38:10,319
go through changes like everything else. It
goes through out the changes. But we have


374
0:38:10,319 --> 0:38:15,859
the gear. We have the equipment. We are knowledgeable.
And this exist if you just reach out a little


375
0:38:15,859 --> 0:38:19,66
bit farther away from the normal life and
be able to do those things, they're very unusual


376
0:38:19,66 --> 0:38:27,72
things, and to see these unusual places. Look
how small we are under this planet that's


377
0:38:27,72 --> 0:38:40,549
called ocean. And this is the edge of the
ice and what we see under the ice, those jellyfish.


378
0:38:40,549 --> 0:38:46,79
That's how the old generation were looking
and listening to whales, and before they arrive


379
0:38:46,79 --> 0:38:48,66
into the crack in the ice. Those are the Inuit
guide. And with those guys will be working


380
0:38:48,66 --> 0:38:55,76
in the field, on the edge of wilderness, to
be able to bring different kinds of experiences


381
0:38:55,76 --> 0:39:0,51
rather than drive in the freeways of America
or sitting at Starbuck, we're sitting on the


382
0:39:0,51 --> 0:39:3,789
edge of the ice, in a tent, for three weeks,
looking for polar bear or looking for the


383
0:39:3,789 --> 0:39:9,45
narwhal. And those are the guys who'd be able
to tell us exactly because they don't have


384
0:39:9,45 --> 0:39:18,849
navigation, hardly ever a satellite phone
working there. And the walruses. And the lonely


385
0:39:18,849 --> 0:39:24,69
walrus that went to die and she moved away
just like the Indian, the American Indian,


386
0:39:24,69 --> 0:39:27,66
you will leave the--she would leave the home
and go by herself into farther way in the


387
0:39:27,66 --> 0:39:33,27
ice and look at the size of those tusks, she
was probably about 11 or 12 years old which


388
0:39:33,27 --> 0:39:41,39
is the maximum that walrus could live and
she went to die by herself, away from everybody


389
0:39:41,39 --> 0:39:58,71
else. And mother and calf. On the edge of
comfort, wilderness, and on the edge of noise.


390
0:39:58,71 --> 0:40:0,7
Two hundred fifty thousand of king penguin
of the island of South Georgia. And sorry,


391
0:40:0,7 --> 0:40:2,68
if my English is believable--just staggering
from the smell, from the noise, and from the


392
0:40:2,68 --> 0:40:10,75
vistas altogether. And only one place on the
planet you see something like that. And it's


393
0:40:10,75 --> 0:40:22,859
one of the most beautiful island you will
ever see and that's is the, you call it the--I


394
0:40:22,859 --> 0:40:27,289
call it the Grandiose (ph) as they stand up,
as we lower ourselves down, it's about 30


395
0:40:27,289 --> 0:40:29,119
inch--about 30 inch tall, 32 inches tall,
laid myself down and looked at the mountain


396
0:40:29,119 --> 0:40:36,48
behind, which was over almost 2,000 feet,
and the penguin in front of us, they are the


397
0:40:36,48 --> 0:40:43,14
king. They are just--give you a chance. That's
a reason to live. That's a reason to breathe,


398
0:40:43,14 --> 0:40:45,13
to do something so fascinating. Who'd designed
anything like that with those colors, with


399
0:40:45,13 --> 0:41:2,73
those wings, and able to swim in the water
and to walk on the land, all at the same time.


400
0:41:2,73 --> 0:41:8,9
Looking for predators, waiting to be eaten.
But there is a predator roaming around the


401
0:41:8,9 --> 0:41:15,349
ice and the only one of it's kind. And we
are all ready to catch his--its picture. We're


402
0:41:15,349 --> 0:41:20,599
all ready for the moment. And they want to
know--anybody knows what is that? Leopard


403
0:41:20,599 --> 0:41:27,75
seals, the only predator that is in Antarctica.
And actually, very interestingly, only during


404
0:41:27,75 --> 0:41:35,16
two months it feed on penguins, on meat, on
meals, on meat. The rest of the time of the


405
0:41:35,16 --> 0:41:39,74
year, they feed on plankton. And look at the
size of the teeth, the canine teeth and the


406
0:41:39,74 --> 0:41:44,519
grinding teeth, that this animal got. Mother
Nature is very, very unique. The animal look


407
0:41:44,519 --> 0:41:51,839
like a prehistoric. It's a nine feet, 9 to
12 feet, long. And it is powerful and it's


408
0:41:51,839 --> 0:41:58,269
fast. It's so agile. It's second that we'd
never seen anything like that. And very curious


409
0:41:58,269 --> 0:42:7,47
by--as diver being together in the water with
them. They are a perfect hunter. But this


410
0:42:7,47 --> 0:42:21,869
is also a perfect places for people like all
of us, clear, fresh water and 300 foot visibility


411
0:42:21,869 --> 0:42:29,269
or more that you notice in Mexico. And, of
course, among the big animal we cannot forget


412
0:42:29,269 --> 0:42:36,63
the gorillas out in Rwanda, or the lion and
the buffalos in Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania.


413
0:42:36,63 --> 0:42:48,79
Anybody knows what is that? And what is this?
What is this? This is the cheetah. And so


414
0:42:48,79 --> 0:42:52,779
what is that? Leopard, right. Well, we're
getting somewhere. And I'm getting away from


415
0:42:52,779 --> 0:43:0,66
you guys. This is on--anybody knows Argentina?
Peninsula Valdes? Anybody heard about Peninsula


416
0:43:0,66 --> 0:43:6,67
Valdes? A world heritage site is in--actually,
a peninsula completely closed to--stopped


417
0:43:6,67 --> 0:43:17,279
to be developed by the World Heritage Foundation
and there are only one--for one particular


418
0:43:17,279 --> 0:43:23,94
reason, there are group of orcas that still,
the only place in the world, which they will


419
0:43:23,94 --> 0:43:28,13
come in and feed by stranding themselves on
the beaches and take the seals out of the


420
0:43:28,13 --> 0:43:32,88
beach. And if you seen the latest movies of
Disney, and they are some section in this


421
0:43:32,88 --> 0:43:34,589
particular place when the orca come on the
beach and take the animals away. Once in every


422
0:43:34,589 --> 0:43:40,76
two or three years I run a special trip out
there and that's the edge of the place in


423
0:43:40,76 --> 0:43:49,609
Peninsula Valdes. And then one of the gauchos
there had arrived in horse and sees I'm an


424
0:43:49,609 --> 0:43:56,48
Israeli, he's the only one that let me ride
on a horse and it was this, I guess, going


425
0:43:56,48 --> 0:44:1,49
just to--I got another native images from
the island of Palau--on the island of Yap


426
0:44:1,49 --> 0:44:11,359
in the Pacific. And to let you know that all
these images are taken actually in the natural


427
0:44:11,359 --> 0:44:15,519
setting and all the animal depicted here are
free and wild. None of them been fed. None


428
0:44:15,519 --> 0:44:21,89
of them been trained. None of them in captivity.
All in the wilderness and all are there somewhere


429
0:44:21,89 --> 0:44:26,25
in the ocean that you can be able to see if
you'll join me. If you are--if you're interested


430
0:44:26,25 --> 0:44:30,69
in any of the trips, either photography or
expeditions or want to know more, one of the


431
0:44:30,69 --> 0:44:34,49
best place to find information is, one of
the best place besides National Geographic


432
0:44:34,49 --> 0:44:44,269
or Noah (ph) is to find from--on my website,
BigAnimals.com. All right. Any questions?


433
0:44:44,269 --> 0:44:50,76
Yes?
>> Do you have an incoming trip that we can


434
0:44:50,76 --> 0:44:53,279
join?
>> NACHOUM: Yes, trip that you can join. This


435
0:44:53,279 --> 0:44:58,19
open--that's open to the public. That's the
reason I ask you. If any of you, please, before


436
0:44:58,19 --> 0:44:59,16
you leave, just fill me up then--there's a
card that I left with you, I'll be able to


437
0:44:59,16 --> 0:45:4,1
continue to be in touch with you. As today,
as you know today, by the media--not the media


438
0:45:4,1 --> 0:45:10,89
but the network or the server are not allow
us to send mass mailing to people unless people


439
0:45:10,89 --> 0:45:17,17
give us the permission to use and to send
you an email. I cannot do that anymore. Otherwise,


440
0:45:17,17 --> 0:45:20,96
they will not let--if they--if you're email
is not certified that I've received it from


441
0:45:20,96 --> 0:45:24,809
you I cannot use it. So if you want to receive
information, I'll be delighted to send you


442
0:45:24,809 --> 0:45:28,66
but only through these cards. Any more questions?
Yes.


443
0:45:28,66 --> 0:45:35,75
>> Have you ever been hurt?
>> NACHOUM: Only in my heart. I was hurt once


444
0:45:35,75 --> 0:45:39,97
and that is the result only of human error.
I was hurt once by, actually, by walrus. When


445
0:45:39,97 --> 0:45:46,619
you operate with the walrus, you need to have,
I need to have always a back-up with me, somebody


446
0:45:46,619 --> 0:45:56,329
watching my back because as you saw on the
images, the walrus is mostly on the iceberg,


447
0:45:56,329 --> 0:46:4,329
but there are other walruses will just coming
back home. And usually mother and calf, that's


448
0:46:4,329 --> 0:46:25,789
the season. So we got off the boat. I got
first with my camera, I'm ready to go, and


449
0:46:25,789 --> 0:46:40,519
the safety divers supposed to come behind
me. He did and I did not pay attention, I


450
0:46:40,519 --> 0:46:51,39
continue moving because when you are with
a camera, you're going to work, your safety


451
0:46:51,39 --> 0:46:51,519
diver is supposed to be behind you. He went
to the water but unfortunately he lost his


452
0:46:51,519 --> 0:46:51,66
tank. The tank was fall off of the carry,
of the BC, so he was delayed getting to me.


453
0:46:51,66 --> 0:46:51,779
I did not know that. I'm looking at the--to
where the iceberg where the walruses were.


454
0:46:51,779 --> 0:46:52,14
And all of the sudden, I felt something strange.
About, you know, you sometimes you a sixth


455
0:46:52,14 --> 0:46:52,839
or seventh sense or ninth sense? The hair
out in your back stand up and you know something


456
0:46:52,839 --> 0:46:53,549
is wrong. And I looked to my side and this
female was very, very close toward me. And


457
0:46:53,549 --> 0:46:53,69
she had a cub with her. So she's clearly going
for me because she was very close with the


458
0:46:53,69 --> 0:46:53,73
tusk. If I will stay where I am, all this
area will be the most sensitive area of humankind


459
0:46:53,73 --> 0:47:0,619
will be affected. I turned my butt and she
nabbed me on my butt. She made a hole in the


460
0:47:0,619 --> 0:47:11,859
dry suit and then I got flooded with water,
got up and put air in my BC, and she came


461
0:47:11,859 --> 0:47:13,68
again. But the second time when she came again,
I turned around and then we had a distance


462
0:47:13,68 --> 0:47:13,869
and I could raise my head with my leg with
my fin and it was a distance between us, she


463
0:47:13,869 --> 0:47:15,599
understood that I'm not after her. She continued
and I took her picture and she went home.


464
0:47:15,599 --> 0:47:23,859
But that's the only time that really we'll
get close to be hurt. It is--that's what I


465
0:47:23,859 --> 0:47:30,619
do. That's what people do when--I have over
30 years of immaculate record, but managing


466
0:47:30,619 --> 0:47:35,839
risk. Well, as you probably--as I mentioned
to you before, I'm from Israel. I was an officer


467
0:47:35,839 --> 0:47:41,98
in the military about almost 12 years in the
Special Forces. Managing risk, it is what


468
0:47:41,98 --> 0:47:46,47
we do, what we learn to do. It doesn't make
any difference. It's not necessary be uniform.


469
0:47:46,47 --> 0:47:51,13
It's not necessary to be guns. It's not necessary--it
is knowing, understanding what the risk you


470
0:47:51,13 --> 0:47:55,64
are facing and how to manage it and to avoid
it. But how to reach the goal that you want


471
0:47:55,64 --> 0:48:2,819
to despite this element is knowledge is the
enemy of all fear. And that's the key. The


472
0:48:2,819 --> 0:48:6,96
more knowledge, the more experience in the
field. Every time pushing the envelope just


473
0:48:6,96 --> 0:48:12,99
one step--don't let the envelope break because
if you blow in it too hard, it will break.


474
0:48:12,99 --> 0:48:16,289
Push it one step at a time and be able to
see the result, measure it and move again,


475
0:48:16,289 --> 0:48:22,67
and retreat. If you need to retreat, it is
a very proud things to do. Retreat, it is


476
0:48:22,67 --> 0:48:25,5
not a defeat. And defeat is when you're not
be able to stand here and share with you the


477
0:48:25,5 --> 0:48:35,49
experiences. Any more question? Yes.
>> [INDISTINCT] you mentioned that [INDISTINCT].


478
0:48:35,49 --> 0:48:39,96
>> NACHOUM: It is about being a long time
in the field. Yes, just being in the field.


479
0:48:39,96 --> 0:48:43,72
I did not learn in any other way. I did not
have, sorry to say or good to say, I did not


480
0:48:43,72 --> 0:48:49,5
have education. But the education was in a
knock--with real knock of life. I paid dearly


481
0:48:49,5 --> 0:48:54,2
for that. But, again, thank for America for
the ability. I borrowed the money. I was able


482
0:48:54,2 --> 0:48:59,579
to return--pay back and that's what gave me
the chance to learn, being in the field. And


483
0:48:59,579 --> 0:49:5,71
if you read the bio that Vivian put together,
in any of the trip I ran as a businessman,


484
0:49:5,71 --> 0:49:13,21
I realized in order for me to gain anything
I had to have the leader of the world in their


485
0:49:13,21 --> 0:49:15,2
businesses; either marine biology, research,
photography, to be co-host with me on the


486
0:49:15,2 --> 0:49:31,949
trip. I learned from them while I went along.
Yes?


487
0:49:31,949 --> 0:49:43,88
>> But what about the [INDISTINCT].
>> NACHOUM: You just said it. You just also


488
0:49:43,88 --> 0:49:48,94
yourself--very, very close to the subject.
You cannot have powerful enough strobe to


489
0:49:48,94 --> 0:49:55,44
match the light from the sun. When you work
with wide angle lens versus working with a


490
0:49:55,44 --> 0:50:0,22
macro, wide angle lens may be capturing a
lot space, you have to count on the ambient


491
0:50:0,22 --> 0:50:6,65
light. The strobe you bring in is only like
a painter bring a brush over, just to highlight


492
0:50:6,65 --> 0:50:12,549
several elements. You touch a very interesting
point and I'll take one more minute. I learned


493
0:50:12,549 --> 0:50:17,279
photography not in photography classes, not
in photography school, not from any photographer.


494
0:50:17,279 --> 0:50:23,799
I learned from the people which their--which
their prints or images sell for millions.


495
0:50:23,799 --> 0:50:29,319
Anybody can give two names of--or three names
of people that their picture of prints sell


496
0:50:29,319 --> 0:50:39,63
for millions? [INDISTINCT] photographer, print,
painter, painter that sell for million. They


497
0:50:39,63 --> 0:50:47,9
are the best teacher in the world. [INDISTINCT]
Van Gogh, Monet, all those--and those picture


498
0:50:47,9 --> 0:50:50,96
are for free. You go to any museum in the
world and you could sit for hours and watch.


499
0:50:50,96 --> 0:50:59,579
Not what they're try to tell you as a photographer
but only how they paint the light. Guys, painter


500
0:50:59,579 --> 0:51:4,79
have the difficult, have a difficult job to
do. They have only white canvas. They have


501
0:51:4,79 --> 0:51:7,869
to create everything to put on the canvas;
the color, the position, the composition,


502
0:51:7,869 --> 0:51:14,339
everything else. As an underwater photographer,
I have exactly opposite challenge. I have


503
0:51:14,339 --> 0:51:17,279
the most creative photo--painter in the world
and creator. He put everything in the water.


504
0:51:17,279 --> 0:51:24,22
The only thing He did not put in the water
is the white light because the water--light


505
0:51:24,22 --> 0:51:29,21
absorbs through the water very fast and the
first 30 feet, you have--you don't see any


506
0:51:29,21 --> 0:51:36,319
more red, no yellows and only green and blue.
So as a photographer, my task is how to bring


507
0:51:36,319 --> 0:51:38,859
the light out and how to understand the light.
And the second job is if I--I don't have a


508
0:51:38,859 --> 0:51:42,39
canvas, so--but what I have is a lens and
to select what part of the animal or the scenery


509
0:51:42,39 --> 0:51:54,42
I see that I want to capture to share with
you. That's the parallel, that's how I look


510
0:51:54,42 --> 0:52:3,21
at it. I was sitting hours, honestly and looking
at the prints or painting of the great painters


511
0:52:3,21 --> 0:52:10,25
to understand what they've done and that's
what I took with me to the water. But not


512
0:52:10,25 --> 0:52:13,41
because of a photographer because I don't
think you can learn photography unless you


513
0:52:13,41 --> 0:52:17,299
do it. And unless you put it out of the market
to sell and you see what people react and


514
0:52:17,299 --> 0:52:22,369
how they buy and how they react to the images
as some of you reacted today.


515
0:52:22,369 --> 0:52:31,23
>> Can you tell us your proudest image? And
can you talk about the image that you missed?


516
0:52:31,23 --> 0:52:34,17
>> NACHOUM: I cannot tell you about images
that I missed because then I'll be very sorry.


517
0:52:34,17 --> 0:52:41,69
That is indeed the dilemma that all photographer
deal with because nobody at home know what


518
0:52:41,69 --> 0:52:44,24
we went through or what I gone through. There
are moments that we miss, but these are not


519
0:52:44,24 --> 0:52:50,16
the moment that we dwell on, it's the moment
where we learn the mistakes or we learn what


520
0:52:50,16 --> 0:52:55,15
we did not know at the time and how it make
it better. But I can tell you the moment which


521
0:52:55,15 --> 0:52:59,69
I'm proud of is like the breach in great white
or like the one with the striped marlin with


522
0:52:59,69 --> 0:53:4,97
the fish in its mouth. It's timely second
to none and that is what make the difference


523
0:53:4,97 --> 0:53:9,849
in still photography versus when you do video.
The anaconda, the anaconda was swimming in


524
0:53:9,849 --> 0:53:14,74
actually in barren river until it eventually
came over the green grass. And I was waiting


525
0:53:14,74 --> 0:53:21,9
for that. You take back all the time with
Mother Nature. So you miss a lot of different


526
0:53:21,9 --> 0:53:27,45
things. I missed several images of the narwhal
as they come in towards--as you saw the narwhal


527
0:53:27,45 --> 0:53:31,99
with the tusk out. There were other images
which I totally missed. Then there are images


528
0:53:31,99 --> 0:53:37,99
that--of a polar bear that actually was--he
had a prey and put his paws over the prey


529
0:53:37,99 --> 0:53:45,22
and rolled it over. But I changed lenses at
that time. You miss. But nobody know those


530
0:53:45,22 --> 0:53:50,769
images except we have to live with it. And
we do. Next time, we do better and better


531
0:53:50,769 --> 0:53:54,95
and better. And that's the challenge. That's
what keep me doing it compared to being in


532
0:53:54,95 --> 0:53:59,309
the military and wearing uniform and commanding
and running after. But that's the challenge,


533
0:53:59,309 --> 0:54:4,99
the excitement and the productivity, and the
beauty you bring to the world rather than


534
0:54:4,99 --> 0:54:10,94
sorrow and pain. Yes?
>> [INDISTINCT]


535
0:54:10,94 --> 0:54:18,109
>> NACHOUM: The million dollar question. I
really don't know. I know I don't take many


536
0:54:18,109 --> 0:54:21,19
pictures while I'm shooting. I don't take
many. No, I don't take many because it is


537
0:54:21,19 --> 0:54:26,24
a mind set. Again, remember the painter I
talked to you about? They knew what they're


538
0:54:26,24 --> 0:54:31,94
going to paint. Da Vinci, Angelo, Rembrandt,
Monet, all of them, Van Gogh, [INDISTINCT]


539
0:54:31,94 --> 0:54:35,579
they knew what they're going to paint. They
elaborate about their painting, about their


540
0:54:35,579 --> 0:54:40,99
colors and what they do, until eventually
they get what they want. I think the same


541
0:54:40,99 --> 0:54:45,589
because I start from the school of film, not
from the school of digital. Digital can shoot


542
0:54:45,589 --> 0:54:52,88
305--800,000 images in one count. I start
with the school of 36 frame so I have to be


543
0:54:52,88 --> 0:54:58,43
very methodical in the way which how--what
is the subject about to choose, what I'm looking


544
0:54:58,43 --> 0:55:5,13
for. And the best photography, in my view,
in photograph--in icon images are images that


545
0:55:5,13 --> 0:55:12,43
you saw before you photograph it or you thought
you're going to see and what happens is Mother


546
0:55:12,43 --> 0:55:15,23
Nature in most time have actually outdid my
own imagination and gave me a present bigger


547
0:55:15,23 --> 0:55:21,94
than any. Like the image of the blue whale
on the back of the card. You said the image


548
0:55:21,94 --> 0:55:31,24
of the blue whale with the fin open is an
image that I've seen earlier in the--about


549
0:55:31,24 --> 0:55:37,44
'87 or '87 or '88 in National Geographic by
Flip Nicholin. And there's an image of a fin


550
0:55:37,44 --> 0:55:44,22
whale across the two pages with a beautiful
sunset in Baha. I really wanted to have this


551
0:55:44,22 --> 0:55:52,19
image or really--but as a good person, we
don't copy, we emulate. We don't copy. So


552
0:55:52,19 --> 0:55:53,29
when I went eventually to Baha in the mid-90
and tried to get my own image, when the blue


553
0:55:53,29 --> 0:55:54,319
whale was just a foot of us, I had to make
a decision, either I'm going to take the picture


554
0:55:54,319 --> 0:56:6,499
of the whole blue whale or half of it because
it's so big the lens could not take it or


555
0:56:6,499 --> 0:56:11,59
find something else. And all of the sudden,
this blue whale actually was resting on the


556
0:56:11,59 --> 0:56:15,21
surface. It allowed me to think for a moment
and to be fast if I could, because that's


557
0:56:15,21 --> 0:56:20,819
the human element, and move toward the tail
which is much more powerful rather than the


558
0:56:20,819 --> 0:56:27,789
whole body, which would be very long and not
distinguished, but over the tail and look


559
0:56:27,789 --> 0:56:31,519
over the horizon and see the island. And that
was a gift. It is not something that I could


560
0:56:31,519 --> 0:56:32,809
dream about. I was impressed by the image
that I've seen in '87, but Mother Nature at


561
0:56:32,809 --> 0:56:41,309
that moment, if I was not open to receive
the information that's given to me, I would


562
0:56:41,309 --> 0:56:49,43
not see it. I'll just do the same thing as
other people did and move on. But at the moment


563
0:56:49,43 --> 0:57:0,18
you look at other opportunities. Always look
at other opportunities. Just like Google does.


564
0:57:0,18 --> 0:57:7,49
Honestly, you guys, or whoever managing and
running and driving you, they are just brilliant.


565
0:57:7,49 --> 0:57:13,19
Never had about bait ball. So you--that means
that you have to join me because that's what


566
0:57:13,19 --> 0:57:19,289
I'm looking for. The bait ball is where the
action is. Most of diving trip, most trip,


567
0:57:19,289 --> 0:57:27,289
period, take people into places which is very
usual and very common and they put down to


568
0:57:27,289 --> 0:57:29,9
walk either to see the Louvre, either to see
the Eiffel, or either to see--jump to the


569
0:57:29,9 --> 0:57:33,13
water, if you go diving, to see the reef,
the coral reef, the clown fish and the eels,


570
0:57:33,13 --> 0:57:38,69
and the so on and so forth. But they are not
focusing, not willing to take the risk, to


571
0:57:38,69 --> 0:57:44,41
see something which not predictable. Bait
ball is not predictable. There is time and


572
0:57:44,41 --> 0:57:49,519
places around the world that could happen.
That is where I put my effort. You will have


573
0:57:49,519 --> 0:57:53,529
to look for an operator that is really looking
for something like that to be able to give


574
0:57:53,529 --> 0:57:59,519
you the opportunity. Oh, why is the ball?
Because the small fish, like people, when


575
0:57:59,519 --> 0:58:4,259
there is an explosion they all run together.
They hug each other for protection. So they


576
0:58:4,259 --> 0:58:8,16
all get together very, very tight. They hope
they will not be taken by the predators because


577
0:58:8,16 --> 0:58:14,869
they will be in the center of the group. But
the group is turning around and everybody


578
0:58:14,869 --> 0:58:21,46
want to be on the center. So is everybody
in and out, in and out and that's the bait


579
0:58:21,46 --> 0:58:22,999
ball. The bait because the bigger fish come
feed on them. Then come the tuna, and then


580
0:58:22,999 --> 0:58:27,779
come the dolphin, and then come the sharks,
and the berets on the top, and a photographer


581
0:58:27,779 --> 0:58:33,309
like us come and take their picture. Any more
question? Yes.


582
0:58:33,309 --> 0:58:36,65
>> [INDISTINCT]
>> NACHOUM: I love film. I grew up on film.


583
0:58:36,65 --> 0:58:42,7
But there's no film yet anymore almost to
be processed, especially slides, to be processed


584
0:58:42,7 --> 0:58:51,13
and to get the result. And digital today really,
coming to an age of excellent in delivering


585
0:58:51,13 --> 0:58:57,89
good--delivering quality. So it's a toast.
It is just because I raise on film and the


586
0:58:57,89 --> 0:59:0,749
black and white and the color and we like
some of the nuances that the cut--that the


587
0:59:0,749 --> 0:59:6,269
film has, but the dynamic range of a digital
reaching to the level of quality of what film


588
0:59:6,269 --> 0:59:14,43
did. So in the next year or two or three,
we'll have digital perhaps even suppress film


589
0:59:14,43 --> 0:59:19,299
and we have to deal with that. If you heard
about HDR, yes? HDR prints have remarkable


590
0:59:19,299 --> 0:59:27,73
details in images that we could not do in
film. So there is a--there is a positive progression


591
0:59:27,73 --> 0:59:35,359
and increasing value and increasing quality.
Any more, guys? I'm sorry?

0:59:35,359 --> 0:59:41,609
>> [INDISTINCT]
>> NACHOUM: I used to carry more than one


593
0:59:41,609 --> 0:59:46,92
camera, yes. But in today because of the digital,
I'd--you don't need. You have 800, a thousand


594
0:59:46,92 --> 0:59:51,93
frames you can shoot on those 32 gigabyte
cards, you can do video at the same time,


595
0:59:51,93 --> 0:59:58,96
so it's one lens in my kind of work, specialty
on the big animals, so only one camera. When


596
0:59:58,96 --> 1:0:4,289
you go to work on the reef, it's a different
story. Because when we work with big animal,


597
1:0:4,289 --> 1:0:10,249
we are in an open ocean. It's wild, it's wilderness.
The encounter could be very short, like, maybe


598
1:0:10,249 --> 1:0:14,619
30 seconds or it can be even half an hour.
But over--but you have only one subject, one


599
1:0:14,619 --> 1:0:20,29
big subject to photograph, so only one lens
will work well. But when you work on the reef


600
1:0:20,29 --> 1:0:22,509
it's a different story because in the reef
you have other elements that you can photograph.


601
1:0:22,509 --> 1:0:28,819
It will be a seal. It would be a sea fin.
It will be sponges. It will be the clown fish.


602
1:0:28,819 --> 1:0:37,67
It will be the fish giving birth or the fish
laying eggs. It's different cameras you want


603
1:0:37,67 --> 1:0:39,89
to carry with you. And also when you are working
on a reef, you're going to be on shallow water;


604
1:0:39,89 --> 1:0:47,499
30, 40, 60 feet. You can stay much longer.
Hour, hour and a half, two hours, if you are


605
1:0:47,499 --> 1:0:51,14
on night treks without problem and then give
you--but you want to have more cameras, even


606
1:0:51,14 --> 1:0:56,29
digital, yes. It's all in the line of work.
It's like everything else. You have a computer,


607
1:0:56,29 --> 1:1:1,999
and you have a handheld, and you have the
iPod, and the whatever. The same thing in


608
1:1:1,999 --> 1:1:7,49
a photography, it's only tools to do the job
and know about the job you want to do, or


609
1:1:7,49 --> 1:1:10,319
if you have a fan and you want--you have a
particular vision, how to keep your vision


610
1:1:10,319 --> 1:1:20,65
and bring it to light. Thank you very much.
Or any more question? Who is coming on a trip


611
1:1:20,65 --> 1:1:25,279
to--this weekend? We're going to do a great
white swimming in and out of the cage. All


612
1:1:25,279 --> 1:3:25,279
right. Thank you very much, guys.
