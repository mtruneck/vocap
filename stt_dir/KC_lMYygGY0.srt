CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: All week we`ve been
looking at different aspects of this massive


2
0:0:5,44 --> 0:0:9,64
storm named Sandy. We`ve talked about the
science behind it, what happened when it hit


3
0:0:9,64 --> 0:0:15,19
the U.S., the devastation that it left behind.
Today we are going to take a look at how Sandy


4
0:0:15,19 --> 0:0:19,64
affected people on an individual level. Plus,
we`re going to take a look ahead the next


5
0:0:19,64 --> 0:0:24,24
Tuesday as the presidential campaigns make
their final push. I`m Carl Azuz. This is CNN


6
0:0:24,24 --> 0:0:31,31
STUDENT NEWS.


7
0:0:31,31 --> 0:0:47,62
When you`ve lived through something like Sandy,
how do you balance the need to emotionally


8
0:0:47,62 --> 0:0:52,3
recover with the need to get back some sense
of normalcy? A lot of people are struggling


9
0:0:52,3 --> 0:0:53,28
with that question right now.


10
0:0:53,28 --> 0:0:53,91
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


11
0:0:53,91 --> 0:0:57,149
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can`t describe it in
words, because there is nothing -- nothing,


12
0:0:57,149 --> 0:1:2,94
all you see is burnt out rubble. That`s it.
Burnt out rubble.


13
0:1:2,94 --> 0:1:7,49
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, it is no words
to put on what happened here, but we -- we


14
0:1:7,49 --> 0:1:11,549
got to start over and bring back this community.


15
0:1:11,549 --> 0:1:14,2
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You take a lot of stuff
for granted, I think until you get to this


16
0:1:14,2 --> 0:1:18,109
point, and then now it`s -- you just want
to get back to it, you know, you want everything


17
0:1:18,109 --> 0:1:19,42
back that you complained about a week ago.


18
0:1:19,42 --> 0:1:22,229
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just want to get back
in there, get the kids back to school and


19
0:1:22,229 --> 0:1:23,799
things like that, get our life back.


20
0:1:23,799 --> 0:1:24,789
(END VIDEO CLIP)


21
0:1:24,789 --> 0:1:28,659
AZUZ: In New York and New Jersey, people are
trying to get back to their normal routines,


22
0:1:28,659 --> 0:1:35,45
but things aren`t normal. This line, it`s
for a bus. With huge sections of the subway


23
0:1:35,45 --> 0:1:40,17
shutdown, bus service is trying to help now.
Some people said it took four or five hours


24
0:1:40,17 --> 0:1:45,29
to get to work on Thursday. And how about
checking your email or sending a text? Millions


25
0:1:45,29 --> 0:1:49,959
of people still didn`t have power on Thursday,
couldn`t even charge their phones. Some of


26
0:1:49,959 --> 0:1:55,24
the ones who did, were offering it up to neighbors.
They set up charging stations, running extension


27
0:1:55,24 --> 0:2:0,29
cords and power strips out of their homes
for anyone to use, the sign of community coming


28
0:2:0,29 --> 0:2:2,909
together as it tries to recover.


29
0:2:2,909 --> 0:2:8,25
On our blog, it`s cnnstudentnews.com, jobs,
the economy and education top your list of


30
0:2:8,25 --> 0:2:9,67
election issues.


31
0:2:9,67 --> 0:2:13,22
Priscilla is concerned about all three. "With
the prices of everything going up, including


32
0:2:13,22 --> 0:2:17,73
college, it is really going to be a challenge
to attain a higher education."


33
0:2:17,73 --> 0:2:20,95
Carol says, "... there are enough jobs for
the people who have just graduated college.


34
0:2:20,95 --> 0:2:24,519
I am worried I won`t be able to support myself
when I graduate."


35
0:2:24,519 --> 0:2:29,2
Max writes," ... education should be the top
concern. If we have a good educational system,


36
0:2:29,2 --> 0:2:32,79
we will be able to make jobs and help the
economy at the same time."


37
0:2:32,79 --> 0:2:37,329
Some folks like Joshua had a different take,
the biggest issue for him is deficit reduction.


38
0:2:37,329 --> 0:2:41,49
As a large deficit could lead to a default
on our debt.


39
0:2:41,49 --> 0:2:45,9
Jabari also notes the debt, saying, "new ways
to try to fix it might not help."


40
0:2:45,9 --> 0:2:50,36
Austin writes, "It`s the high price of fuel.
I think that if the price of gas were lower,


41
0:2:50,36 --> 0:2:52,1
more people would have jobs ..."


42
0:2:52,1 --> 0:2:56,6
And Brittany feels that Obama and Romney should
talk more about what will happen when schools


43
0:2:56,6 --> 0:3:1,49
have to fire teachers because the school is
low on money."


44
0:3:1,49 --> 0:3:4,98
People who think jobs are the number one election
issue, might focus on a government report


45
0:3:4,98 --> 0:3:9,219
that comes out every month. It updates the
national unemployment rate and says how many


46
0:3:9,219 --> 0:3:13,95
jobs were added the month before. The latest
numbers come out today, and they are the last


47
0:3:13,95 --> 0:3:18,17
ones coming out before Tuesday`s election.
You could be sure the presidential candidates


48
0:3:18,17 --> 0:3:23,68
will be talking about this report and hoping
it helps them gain some support on Tuesday.


49
0:3:23,68 --> 0:3:27,769
We looked at Governor Romney and President
Obama`s economic policies earlier this week.


50
0:3:27,769 --> 0:3:33,219
Today, as we wrap up our series on the candidates`
positions we are focusing on foreign policy.


51
0:3:33,219 --> 0:3:37,9
That covers a lot of issues, so we are going
to cover two of them today. First one, the


52
0:3:37,9 --> 0:3:42,99
war in Afghanistan. President Obama has announced
the plan that would have U.S. combat troops


53
0:3:42,99 --> 0:3:47,73
out of Afghanistan by 2014. Governor Romney
has said, he supports gradually pulling American


54
0:3:47,73 --> 0:3:53,319
forces out of Afghanistan, but he`s criticized
the president for announcing the timetable.


55
0:3:53,319 --> 0:3:58,349
Next up, Iran. When it comes to that country`s
controversial nuclear program, the U.S. presidential


56
0:3:58,349 --> 0:4:3,299
candidates share a lot of the same basic ideas.
Neither one wants Iran to be able to develop


57
0:4:3,299 --> 0:4:8,4
a nuclear weapon. Both support the idea of
using sanctions, punishments against Iran


58
0:4:8,4 --> 0:4:13,459
and neither one has ruled out the idea of
using military force against Iran.


59
0:4:13,459 --> 0:4:19,26
We have a ton of resources on the presidential
election on our home page. Go to cnnstudentnews.com,


60
0:4:19,26 --> 0:4:21,5
check out the election resources bin.


61
0:4:21,5 --> 0:4:26,83
We are in the home stretch of this presidential
campaign. For some folks, it feels like it`s


62
0:4:26,83 --> 0:4:31,57
going on forever. It`s this idea called voter
fatigue. That after months and months of the


63
0:4:31,57 --> 0:4:36,53
speeches and the rallies, the media coverage
and especially the ads, some people are just


64
0:4:36,53 --> 0:4:41,1
worn out. Presidential candidates have been
making political ads for decades, but they


65
0:4:41,1 --> 0:4:43,79
haven`t always look like the ones we see today.
Watch this.


66
0:4:43,79 --> 0:4:44,7
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


67
0:4:44,7 --> 0:4:45,57
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You like Ike, I like Ike,
everybody likes Ike.


68
0:4:45,57 --> 0:4:51,45
DARRELL WEST, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: The way
that candidates communicate with voters tells


69
0:4:51,45 --> 0:4:55,24
us a lot about the politicians, but also about
ourselves.


70
0:4:55,24 --> 0:4:57,52
JOHN F. KENNEDY: This is candidate John Kennedy.


71
0:4:57,52 --> 0:4:58,51
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Johnson.


72
0:4:58,51 --> 0:4:59,72
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jimmy Carter.


73
0:4:59,72 --> 0:5:4,31
WEST: So, it`s an amazing lens on American
culture and on American politics.`


74
0:5:4,31 --> 0:5:9,36
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This time, vote like your
whole world depended on it.


75
0:5:9,36 --> 0:5:15,63
WEST: The biggest difference in ads that we
see today is really in the editing. Today,


76
0:5:15,63 --> 0:5:22,8
we have a much faster pace, they splice different
images together, there is much greater sophistication


77
0:5:22,8 --> 0:5:26,62
in the production that lies behind contemporary
ads.


78
0:5:26,62 --> 0:5:29,96
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Eisenhower answers America.


79
0:5:29,96 --> 0:5:37,59
WEST: The first presidential election where
TV ads played a role was 1952, Dwight Eisenhower


80
0:5:37,59 --> 0:5:44,29
pulled together footage from press conferences
and basically had "Eisenhower Answering America."


81
0:5:44,29 --> 0:5:47,53
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This historic moment is
brought to you by Citizens for Kennedy.


82
0:5:47,53 --> 0:5:53,84
WEST: 1960 is really considered the first
television election, that was the first election


83
0:5:53,84 --> 0:6:0,22
where we had TV debates between Kennedy and
Nixon, ads also were seen as very prominent,


84
0:6:0,22 --> 0:6:7,64
because it was a wave for Kennedy to basically
contrast his youthfulness with Nixon experience.


85
0:6:7,64 --> 0:6:10,67
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They understand what peace
demands.


86
0:6:10,67 --> 0:6:16,72
WEST: 1964 was a very interesting election,
and it featured a lot of attack ads.


87
0:6:16,72 --> 0:6:18,1
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Four, five, six ...


88
0:6:18,1 --> 0:6:22,99
WEST: There was a famous ad called "the daisy
ad", incumbent president Lyndon Johnson had


89
0:6:22,99 --> 0:6:28,66
a little girl in a meadow pulling petals off
of a daisy and in the background you have


90
0:6:28,66 --> 0:6:32,4
the countdown, and at the end of the end,
there is a nuclear explosion.


91
0:6:32,4 --> 0:6:34,87
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nine, eight, seven, six,
five ...


92
0:6:34,87 --> 0:6:40,2
WEST: By today standards, it seems remarkably
tame, because we`ve seen a lot more vicious


93
0:6:40,2 --> 0:6:47,95
and personal attacks on individuals. But when
that ad aired, it actually only aired once


94
0:6:47,95 --> 0:6:54,19
on network television, the public outcry was
so strong that Johnson took down that ad and


95
0:6:54,19 --> 0:6:54,94
never aired it again.


96
0:6:54,94 --> 0:6:55,95

97
0:6:55,95 --> 0:7:1,64
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mrs. Golden`s U.S. and world history


98
0:7:1,64 --> 0:7:8,55
classes at the Augusta Fells Savage Institute
of Visual Arts in Baltimore, Maryland. Who


99
0:7:8,55 --> 0:7:15,35
painted this famous artwork? You know what
to do. Was it Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello


100
0:7:15,35 --> 0:7:20,6
or Raphael? You`ve got three seconds, go!


101
0:7:20,6 --> 0:7:30,2
You`re looking at Michelangelo`s masterpiece
on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. That`s


102
0:7:30,2 --> 0:7:33,65
your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."


103
0:7:33,65 --> 0:7:36,17
(END VIDEO CLIP)


104
0:7:36,17 --> 0:7:42,72
AZUZ: Michelangelo`s masterpiece is celebrating
a big birthday this week. In 1512, exactly


105
0:7:42,72 --> 0:7:48,53
500 years ago, it was finished and open to
the public. The different panels on the Sistine


106
0:7:48,53 --> 0:7:53,17
Chapel ceiling show people and events from
the Bible. The most famous one is the creation


107
0:7:53,17 --> 0:7:57,55
of Adam, which shows the arms of God and Adam
reaching out to each other. The painting has


108
0:7:57,55 --> 0:8:3,59
survived centuries of war and severe weather.
But now, it`s facing a new threat, one that


109
0:8:3,59 --> 0:8:5,33
comes from an unexpected source.


110
0:8:5,33 --> 0:8:6,17
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


111
0:8:6,17 --> 0:8:10,24
BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Today the
greatest threat to this priceless art comes


112
0:8:10,24 --> 0:8:16,53
from those who flock to admire it. About 5
million people visit the Sistine Chapel every


113
0:8:16,53 --> 0:8:24,12
year, that means 5 million people with sweat,
with heat, with dust.


114
0:8:24,12 --> 0:8:29,92
The number of visitors is expected only to
grown in coming years. The Vatican is planning


115
0:8:29,92 --> 0:8:35,8
to upgrade the current climate control system
for the chapel, but officials are hesitant


116
0:8:35,8 --> 0:8:36,469
to turn tourists away.


117
0:8:36,469 --> 0:8:36,99
(END VIDEO CLIP)


118
0:8:36,99 --> 0:8:41,969
AZUZ: We don`t have to wait till next Tuesday
for election results, thanks to some presidential


119
0:8:41,969 --> 0:8:47,78
prognosticators. Like the Redskins rule. If
the team wins its last home game before the


120
0:8:47,78 --> 0:8:53,14
election, the person or party in power stays
there. Road team wins, expect a victory for


121
0:8:53,14 --> 0:8:57,11
the White House challenger. Has that ever
been manipulated before? We`d be worried about


122
0:8:57,11 --> 0:8:58,14
pass interference.


123
0:8:58,14 --> 0:9:4,26
If football is not your cup of tea, try coffee.
711 is selling Obama and Romney cups of java,


124
0:9:4,26 --> 0:9:7,94
those results will be hot off the presses.
Halloween may be over, but some people think


125
0:9:7,94 --> 0:9:13,33
they can predict the presidency based on which
candidate`s mask sold more. On election day,


126
0:9:13,33 --> 0:9:18,63
they`ll face reality. And the squirrel can
tell us the outcome based on which dish it


127
0:9:18,63 --> 0:9:23,7
eats from. Some of these ideas seem a little
wacky, that squirrel one is downright nuts,


128
0:9:23,7 --> 0:9:28,45
but hey, listen, it`s not scientific, it just
food for thought. One thing we can predict,


129
0:9:28,45 --> 0:9:32,36
we will be back on the air next Monday, so
we hope to see you then, and that you have


130
0:9:32,36 --> 0:11:32,36
a wonderful weekend. Bye now.
