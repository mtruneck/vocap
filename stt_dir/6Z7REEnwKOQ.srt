0:0:12,1 --> 0:0:14,23
The Titanic was first discovered
in 1985


2
0:0:14,23 --> 0:0:17,13
by Dr. Robert Ballard and a team
of researchers


3
0:0:17,13 --> 0:0:19,6
with the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institute


4
0:0:19,6 --> 0:0:22,0
and Ifremer, a French institution.


5
0:0:22,0 --> 0:0:26,2
We returned to Titanic in 2004
with Dr. Ballard


6
0:0:26,2 --> 0:0:28,93
to conduct some further studies


7
0:0:28,93 --> 0:0:30,93
and scientific research at the
site.


8
0:0:30,93 --> 0:0:34,3
We compared the information
that was first discovered


9
0:0:34,3 --> 0:0:37,73
back in '85 and '86 with how the
site has changed now.


10
0:0:37,73 --> 0:0:41,2
We conducted an updated photo
mosaic of the site.


11
0:0:41,2 --> 0:0:45,0
We researched the rusticles that
are growing on the wreck.


12
0:0:45,0 --> 0:0:48,0
We conducted high resolution
video imagery


13
0:0:48,0 --> 0:0:50,6
of the debris field in the site
itself,


14
0:0:50,6 --> 0:2:50,6
as well as at the back of the
wreck.
