SHANE SMITH: Hey, it's
Shane from Vice.


2
0:0:1,56 --> 0:0:3,6
And this show features
all of our best shit


3
0:0:3,6 --> 0:0:4,29
from over the years.


4
0:0:4,29 --> 0:0:6,32
It's some freaky, freaky
business, and we


5
0:0:6,32 --> 0:0:7,17
hope you like it.


6
0:0:7,17 --> 0:0:8,7
Welcome to Vice Presents.


7
0:0:8,7 --> 0:0:12,98



8
0:0:12,98 --> 0:0:15,11
I actually went to North
Korea twice.


9
0:0:15,11 --> 0:0:16,61
The first time we snuck
in, they wouldn't


10
0:0:16,61 --> 0:0:18,16
let me shoot anything.


11
0:0:18,16 --> 0:0:21,14
And then while we were there,
we got drunk doing karaoke


12
0:0:21,14 --> 0:0:21,91
with some generals.


13
0:0:21,91 --> 0:0:25,2
And they let us come in the
second time when we shot.


14
0:0:25,2 --> 0:0:27,89
But when they heard what we had
shot, and when they saw


15
0:0:27,89 --> 0:0:29,39
the documentary, they
got mad at us.


16
0:0:29,39 --> 0:0:32,9
In fact, my PA called me one day
and said, don't come into


17
0:0:32,9 --> 0:0:32,87
the office.


18
0:0:32,87 --> 0:0:35,4
There's two North Koreans
here from the embassy.


19
0:0:35,4 --> 0:0:37,71
Problem is, they don't have
an embassy in America.


20
0:0:37,71 --> 0:0:40,83
So I didn't go into the office,
and I'm sure as hell


21
0:0:40,83 --> 0:0:42,8
not going back to North Korea.


22
0:0:42,8 --> 0:0:49,46



23
0:0:49,46 --> 0:0:52,0
Nobody knows anything about
North Korea, so we were


24
0:0:52,0 --> 0:0:53,2
fascinated by it.


25
0:0:53,2 --> 0:0:56,1
And we tried to get in for a
year and a half but couldn't,


26
0:0:56,1 --> 0:0:58,59
because North Korea doesn't
let anyone in.


27
0:0:58,59 --> 0:1:3,45
They do not want anyone to
corrupt their 100% homogeneous


28
0:1:3,45 --> 0:1:7,922
society that is 100% ruled by
one person, Kim Jong-il.


29
0:1:7,922 --> 0:1:10,6



30
0:1:10,6 --> 0:1:13,23
In the end, we just got so
frustrated that we ended up


31
0:1:13,23 --> 0:1:17,6
flying to South Korea and
saying, well, at least we can


32
0:1:17,6 --> 0:1:20,81
go to the DMZ and put our foot
into North Korea and at least


33
0:1:20,81 --> 0:1:22,74
see a little bit of
it from the South.


34
0:1:22,74 --> 0:1:26,4
Let's go see the DMZ, which is
the Demilitarized Zone, which


35
0:1:26,4 --> 0:1:28,88
is the border between North
Korea and South Korea.


36
0:1:28,88 --> 0:1:35,5



37
0:1:35,5 --> 0:1:39,48
Since the Korean War ended, it's
been the most militarized


38
0:1:39,48 --> 0:1:42,38
zone on earth, with two million
estimated troops on


39
0:1:42,38 --> 0:1:44,51
the North Korean side,
about 500,000 on the


40
0:1:44,51 --> 0:1:45,49
South Korean side.


41
0:1:45,49 --> 0:1:48,79
Missiles pointed at each other,
artillery, tanks.


42
0:1:48,79 --> 0:1:51,34
There's three million mines
on the border itself.


43
0:1:51,34 --> 0:1:54,23
In fact, there are so many mines
that the North Koreans


44
0:1:54,23 --> 0:1:57,5
built invasion tunnels where
they went 70 meters down.


45
0:1:57,5 --> 0:2:1,57
And they're like, we can be in
Seoul in an hour and a half.


46
0:2:1,57 --> 0:2:4,85
Now the CIA and the American
Army have found a number of


47
0:2:4,85 --> 0:2:8,479
these, but they think that
there's even more.


48
0:2:8,479 --> 0:2:10,61
It's been called the end of
the world, and it's the


49
0:2:10,61 --> 0:2:12,62
closest you can get to
seeing North Korea.


50
0:2:12,62 --> 0:2:17,47



51
0:2:17,47 --> 0:2:18,62
Getting to the DMZ isn't easy.


52
0:2:18,62 --> 0:2:21,41
It's only an hour and a half
North of Seoul, but you have


53
0:2:21,41 --> 0:2:23,34
to go through about
15 checkpoints.


54
0:2:23,34 --> 0:2:26,66
Then you have to go through
a United Nations sort of


55
0:2:26,66 --> 0:2:29,61
indoctrination session, where
they're like, don't point,


56
0:2:29,61 --> 0:2:31,41
don't look at them,
don't take any


57
0:2:31,41 --> 0:2:33,3
pictures, don't do anything.


58
0:2:33,3 --> 0:2:35,132
We're only going to be there
for two and a half minutes.


59
0:2:35,132 --> 0:2:41,88



60
0:2:41,88 --> 0:2:44,84
So we're at the last stop
in South Korea before


61
0:2:44,84 --> 0:2:46,32
going to the DMZ.


62
0:2:46,32 --> 0:2:49,81
This here is Freedom Bridge, but
after the Korean War was


63
0:2:49,81 --> 0:2:52,83
the last time the North and
South exchanged POWs.


64
0:2:52,83 --> 0:2:56,35
And on the other side of that
now, a little further back, is


65
0:2:56,35 --> 0:2:57,6
North Korea.


66
0:2:57,6 --> 0:2:59,56



67
0:2:59,56 --> 0:3:1,59
Right here, it's kind of
like a theme park.


68
0:3:1,59 --> 0:3:4,2
But as you see just beyond the
theme park, kind of hidden by


69
0:3:4,2 --> 0:3:7,36
the trees, there's barbed wire
and land mines and checkpoints


70
0:3:7,36 --> 0:3:8,79
everywhere.


71
0:3:8,79 --> 0:3:12,901
So it's kind of a very
bizarre theme park.


72
0:3:12,901 --> 0:3:18,9
So a lot of families come, and
they put up messages or


73
0:3:18,9 --> 0:3:21,26
prayers for their family in the
North that they've been


74
0:3:21,26 --> 0:3:23,68
split and never allowed
to see.


75
0:3:23,68 --> 0:3:26,505
So they all come here and make a
pilgrimage and say, OK, this


76
0:3:26,505 --> 0:3:28,66
is what I'm going to put up.


77
0:3:28,66 --> 0:3:31,6
Someone's put up some
golf balls there.


78
0:3:31,6 --> 0:3:33,48
I think the South's going to
lose pretty damn quick.


79
0:3:33,48 --> 0:3:37,14
They're going to be sort of rave
soldiers, brought up on


80
0:3:37,14 --> 0:3:37,992
PlayStation.


81
0:3:37,992 --> 0:3:40,895
Versus the North Koreans
who eat grass and


82
0:3:40,895 --> 0:3:42,145
sleep with their AK.


83
0:3:42,145 --> 0:3:58,3



84
0:3:58,3 --> 0:4:0,78
And so you get off the bus,
and you look across, and


85
0:4:0,78 --> 0:4:1,725
there's North Korea.


86
0:4:1,725 --> 0:4:5,71
They're like, that's North
Korea, get back on the bus.


87
0:4:5,71 --> 0:4:7,45
You could start World War III.


88
0:4:7,45 --> 0:4:8,7
They really get you terrified.


89
0:4:8,7 --> 0:4:11,55



90
0:4:11,55 --> 0:4:15,14
They let you into one barracks
room, and the barracks room is


91
0:4:15,14 --> 0:4:17,779
half in North Korea, half
in South Korea.


92
0:4:17,779 --> 0:4:20,89
And they set that up so that
they could have talks.


93
0:4:20,89 --> 0:4:23,4
But it's the only place where
you can go and actually set


94
0:4:23,4 --> 0:4:25,87
foot, technically,
into North Korea.


95
0:4:25,87 --> 0:4:29,33
And this is as close as 99.9%
of the people in the world


96
0:4:29,33 --> 0:4:32,57
will ever get to getting
into North Korea.


97
0:4:32,57 --> 0:4:35,615
And people are like,
that's North Korea.


98
0:4:35,615 --> 0:4:37,6
MALE SPEAKER: So that
piece of concrete--


99
0:4:37,6 --> 0:4:40,31
SHANE SMITH: That concrete--
so the gravel is South, the


100
0:4:40,31 --> 0:4:43,81
concrete is the demarcation
line, and the sand is--


101
0:4:43,81 --> 0:4:45,6
MALE SPEAKER: North.


102
0:4:45,6 --> 0:4:49,32



103
0:4:49,32 --> 0:4:50,57
SHANE SMITH: No finger
pointing.


104
0:4:50,57 --> 0:4:53,8



105
0:4:53,8 --> 0:4:55,215
We're like, dude, we have
to get into North Korea.


106
0:4:55,215 --> 0:4:56,55
We have to get in.


107
0:4:56,55 --> 0:5:18,332



108
0:5:18,332 --> 0:5:21,28
GEORGE BUSH: North Korea has a
regime arming with missiles


109
0:5:21,28 --> 0:5:23,3
and weapons of mass
destruction.


110
0:5:23,3 --> 0:5:27,64
States like these and their
terrorist allies constitute an


111
0:5:27,64 --> 0:5:30,6
axis of evil arming
to threaten the


112
0:5:30,6 --> 0:5:31,91
peace of the world.


113
0:5:31,91 --> 0:5:35,0
The United States of America
will not permit the world's


114
0:5:35,0 --> 0:5:38,53
most dangerous regimes to
threaten us with the world's


115
0:5:38,53 --> 0:5:39,82
most destructive weapons.


116
0:5:39,82 --> 0:5:58,784



117
0:5:58,784 --> 0:6:0,52
SHANE SMITH: We couldn't
get in.


118
0:6:0,52 --> 0:6:5,18
We tried through the Embassy,
through press, through Swedish


119
0:6:5,18 --> 0:6:7,7
embassy, British embassy,
Canadian


120
0:6:7,7 --> 0:6:8,8
embassy, German embassy.


121
0:6:8,8 --> 0:6:11,53
And I was saying to myself,
what in God's


122
0:6:11,53 --> 0:6:13,32
name is going on here?


123
0:6:13,32 --> 0:6:17,8
So we were interviewing North
Korean refugees in South


124
0:6:17,8 --> 0:6:21,32
Korea, and a few of them had
said, just go to Shenyang and


125
0:6:21,32 --> 0:6:23,59
bribe the consulate there.


126
0:6:23,59 --> 0:6:25,16
That's what everybody
else does.


127
0:6:25,16 --> 0:6:28,24
So we were in South Korea, and
we said why not, we're here?


128
0:6:28,24 --> 0:6:31,79
So we flew up to China, and
we had nothing to lose.


129
0:6:31,79 --> 0:6:43,3



130
0:6:43,3 --> 0:6:46,42
And we met the consul
in Shenyang, paid


131
0:6:46,42 --> 0:6:49,15
a fee, a visa fee.


132
0:6:49,15 --> 0:6:53,282
And we left our passports there,
and in fact most of our


133
0:6:53,282 --> 0:6:55,69
money, and we went back to
this North Korean hotel.


134
0:6:55,69 --> 0:6:59,65
We had to stay in one of their
hotels in Northern China, and


135
0:6:59,65 --> 0:7:1,7
we were supposed to hear
back from them at


136
0:7:1,7 --> 0:7:3,17
4:00 the next afternoon.


137
0:7:3,17 --> 0:7:5,22
At 6:00 in the morning, there's
a banging on our door,


138
0:7:5,22 --> 0:7:7,4
and we wake up all
discombobulated.


139
0:7:7,4 --> 0:7:9,14
And they're like, we have
to go now, here's your


140
0:7:9,14 --> 0:7:10,2
passport, let's go.


141
0:7:10,2 --> 0:7:11,45
And we're like where
are we going?


142
0:7:11,45 --> 0:7:12,13
Where are we going?


143
0:7:12,13 --> 0:7:14,7
And they don't give you any time
to react, not one second.


144
0:7:14,7 --> 0:7:16,74
They take you right out from
the room at 6:00 in the


145
0:7:16,74 --> 0:7:18,7
morning, get you on the plane.


146
0:7:18,7 --> 0:7:20,56
Shenyang, you know, you've
got to come to Shenyang.


147
0:7:20,56 --> 0:7:24,288
Stay here at the North Korean
hotel with concrete beds.


148
0:7:24,288 --> 0:7:32,43



149
0:7:32,43 --> 0:7:35,4
You're not allowed to bring
anything into North Korea.


150
0:7:35,4 --> 0:7:38,41
You can't bring a cellphone,
you can't bring a computer,


151
0:7:38,41 --> 0:7:41,5
you can't bring any printed
material, any music.


152
0:7:41,5 --> 0:7:43,834
They don't want you to
have anything that


153
0:7:43,834 --> 0:7:44,96
you even leave there.


154
0:7:44,96 --> 0:7:48,15
In fact, they don't want you to
bring any type of camera in


155
0:7:48,15 --> 0:7:49,6
that was too sophisticated.


156
0:7:49,6 --> 0:7:51,26
No telephoto lenses, nothing.


157
0:7:51,26 --> 0:7:52,722
You can bring basically
a point and


158
0:7:52,722 --> 0:7:53,972
shoot, and that's it.


159
0:7:53,972 --> 0:7:58,3



160
0:7:58,3 --> 0:8:1,79
In fact, when you go in you have
to sign a thing saying


161
0:8:1,79 --> 0:8:3,96
I'm not bringing in anything.


162
0:8:3,96 --> 0:8:6,76
And let me tell you, if they
find out that you did, you're


163
0:8:6,76 --> 0:8:8,1
in deep shit.


164
0:8:8,1 --> 0:8:13,735



165
0:8:13,735 --> 0:8:17,31
And then you're flying from
Shenyang to Pyongyang in North


166
0:8:17,31 --> 0:8:21,35
Korea, and you go holy shit,
we're going to North Korea.


167
0:8:21,35 --> 0:8:24,18
And with the express purpose of
shooting, which you're not


168
0:8:24,18 --> 0:8:25,15
allowed to do.


169
0:8:25,15 --> 0:8:28,2
With the express purpose of
making a documentary, which


170
0:8:28,2 --> 0:8:29,64
you're not allowed to do.


171
0:8:29,64 --> 0:8:31,2
This is terrifying.


172
0:8:31,2 --> 0:8:34,365
So from the first minute I got
there, I was shit scared.


173
0:8:34,365 --> 0:9:15,41



174
0:9:15,41 --> 0:9:19,818
SHANE SMITH: First sight of
Pyongyang, pretty dismal.


175
0:9:19,818 --> 0:9:31,6



176
0:9:31,6 --> 0:9:35,8
We're in a hotel that's
about 47 stories tall.


177
0:9:35,8 --> 0:9:36,765
Nobody's in it.


178
0:9:36,765 --> 0:9:39,3
I think there's only one floor
with any people on it.


179
0:9:39,3 --> 0:9:51,18



180
0:9:51,18 --> 0:9:57,615
We're in the hotel, and we've
been told that they're bugged,


181
0:9:57,615 --> 0:9:59,1
that they're listening to us.


182
0:9:59,1 --> 0:10:1,575
I don't know if whispering
is going to help.


183
0:10:1,575 --> 0:10:5,9
That might be where
it all stems from.


184
0:10:5,9 --> 0:10:5,58
Hello?


185
0:10:5,58 --> 0:10:6,4
Hello?


186
0:10:6,4 --> 0:10:7,85
Oh!


187
0:10:7,85 --> 0:10:9,32
Come in.


188
0:10:9,32 --> 0:10:12,26
Come in, Tokyo.


189
0:10:12,26 --> 0:10:13,73
Hello?


190
0:10:13,73 --> 0:10:14,71
Hello?


191
0:10:14,71 --> 0:10:17,65
Hello?


192
0:10:17,65 --> 0:10:18,64
Hello?


193
0:10:18,64 --> 0:10:19,89
We're here.


194
0:10:19,89 --> 0:10:33,9



195
0:10:33,9 --> 0:10:36,35
Right after we get there, we
were taken for our first meal.


196
0:10:36,35 --> 0:10:40,53
And the first time you eat in
North Korea, it's kind of a


197
0:10:40,53 --> 0:10:42,81
sign of the very weird
things to come.


198
0:10:42,81 --> 0:10:51,191



199
0:10:51,191 --> 0:10:55,135
FEMALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING KOREAN]


200
0:10:55,135 --> 0:10:57,107
Oh, this is where we go, here?


201
0:10:57,107 --> 0:10:58,375
Table is over here.


202
0:10:58,375 --> 0:10:59,625
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sit please.


203
0:10:59,625 --> 0:11:10,184

SHANE SMITH: We're in the
big banquet room.


205
0:11:11,84 --> 0:11:13,24
As you can see, it's huge.


206
0:11:13,24 --> 0:11:17,32
There's about 20 women, we're
getting ready for our dinner.


207
0:11:17,32 --> 0:11:19,98
First of all, they give you
about three or four courses of


208
0:11:19,98 --> 0:11:21,78
absolutely inedible food.


209
0:11:21,78 --> 0:11:25,5
It's just matter, it's
like fried matter.


210
0:11:25,5 --> 0:11:27,69
And you're kind of going,
yeah, yeah.


211
0:11:27,69 --> 0:11:29,6
But you're waiting for everyone
to fill in, when's


212
0:11:29,6 --> 0:11:30,56
this banquet happening?


213
0:11:30,56 --> 0:11:31,39
When's the banquet?


214
0:11:31,39 --> 0:11:33,27
There is no banquet.


215
0:11:33,27 --> 0:11:35,495
Where is everyone?


216
0:11:35,495 --> 0:11:37,475
It's not very busy here.


217
0:11:37,475 --> 0:11:40,65
They realize they've gotten so
much bad press for not having


218
0:11:40,65 --> 0:11:43,49
food that they want to show oh,
there's plenty of food,


219
0:11:43,49 --> 0:11:44,63
food everywhere.


220
0:11:44,63 --> 0:11:46,75
And they're carefully laying
out the food the whole time


221
0:11:46,75 --> 0:11:47,37
you're eating.


222
0:11:47,37 --> 0:11:50,35
And then as you're leaving you
notice they're pulling all the


223
0:11:50,35 --> 0:11:53,76
things they've just carefully
laid into little tiny trays


224
0:11:53,76 --> 0:11:55,92
they're carefully going
to bring back and keep


225
0:11:55,92 --> 0:11:57,92
for the next day.


226
0:11:57,92 --> 0:12:0,15
And you're just sitting there
by yourself, eating your


227
0:12:0,15 --> 0:12:2,61
matter, going OK, I've
come to crazy land.


228
0:12:2,61 --> 0:12:8,73



229
0:12:8,73 --> 0:12:9,76
Thanks a lot.
