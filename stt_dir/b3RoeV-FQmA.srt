1
0:0:10,919 --> 0:0:13,409
Pasta compomodori. It's


2
0:0:13,409 --> 0:0:21,129
basic, basic tomato sauce. The basis of lots of Italian recipes. It is classic.


3
0:0:21,129 --> 0:0:23,789
We are going to show you two different directions


4
0:0:23,789 --> 0:0:27,779
One is gonna be arrabiata and
then the other one is tuna and capers


5
0:0:27,779 --> 0:0:29,42



6
0:0:29,42 --> 0:0:33,42
Onions and garlic and tinned tomatoes are your base


7
0:0:33,42 --> 0:0:38,2
Ems, you're on the onions. I'm going to chop the garlic


8
0:0:38,2 --> 0:0:43,56
My trick with garlic is I put a bit of salt on it and it releases all the juices


9
0:0:43,56 --> 0:0:44,95



10
0:0:44,95 --> 0:0:47,5
Look at all that moisture


11
0:0:47,5 --> 0:0:50,97
That's the salt that's released that. It makes it really easy to crush


12
0:0:50,97 --> 0:0:55,22
with a flat blade. A nice glug of olive oil. Heat it up


13
0:0:55,22 --> 0:0:59,89
Ready? Yup


14
0:0:59,89 --> 0:1:7,34
We've got a lovely mix of different sized onions in there. Authentic.


15
0:1:7,34 --> 0:1:12,56
In theory you'd have them all diced nice and fine. Garlic wants to go in a little bit later because


16
0:1:12,56 --> 0:1:16,29
you don't want it to burn, the garlic 
cooks much quicker than the onion's. Ems


17
0:1:16,29 --> 0:1:19,4
will you open the tin of tomatoes. Make sure they're chopped


18
0:1:19,4 --> 0:1:21,59
Mum's shown us how to do this.


19
0:1:21,59 --> 0:1:28,76
It just saves you pulling them out and chopping them. There we go nice chopped tomatoes


20
0:1:28,76 --> 0:1:30,85
Look at that!


21
0:1:30,85 --> 0:1:35,27
Because there's a lot of liquid in there we also cheat with the stock.


22
0:1:35,27 --> 0:1:37,799
Crumble that stock in and it will dissolve


23
0:1:37,799 --> 0:1:39,85
Trust me!


24
0:1:39,85 --> 0:1:42,229
It does the job, it really does.


25
0:1:42,229 --> 0:1:47,159
There's some bigger chunks of tomatoes there. Just bash it down with your spoon


26
0:1:47,159 --> 0:1:48,6
Put some salt and pepper in them


27
0:1:48,6 --> 0:1:53,74
and then pepper anchino, which is cayenne pepper. Not enough to make it spicy.


28
0:1:53,74 --> 0:1:56,22
It should just give it a little heat


29
0:1:56,22 --> 0:2:0,909
That is a classic tomato sauce. I'm just going to have a little taste. I'll have a little taste too please.


30
0:2:0,909 --> 0:2:4,409
Leave it to simmer as it is, for about 15 minutes but that's pretty much


31
0:2:4,409 --> 0:2:7,429
the same time as your pasta's going to cook


32
0:2:7,429 --> 0:2:10,69
Mum would literally make this in vats


33
0:2:10,69 --> 0:2:12,49
Do you want to come and have a little look?


34
0:2:12,49 --> 0:2:14,569
This is where she stores all the essentials


35
0:2:14,569 --> 0:2:16,72
Italian tuna, Italian pasta. Here we go.


36
0:2:16,72 --> 0:2:19,429
Come September they'll


37
0:2:19,429 --> 0:2:23,79
probably be 15 of these and these are brilliant because they're


38
0:2:23,79 --> 0:2:27,79
like little bricks, they're perfect for two people. You can pop that straight into


39
0:2:27,79 --> 0:2:28,49
a pan


40
0:2:28,49 --> 0:2:33,79
from frozen, ten minutes on the heat? Mum's going to hate the fact that we're in here. Don't tell her!


41
0:2:33,79 --> 0:2:37,219
Come on, take a look at our pasta store cupboard  essentials video.


42
0:2:37,219 --> 0:2:42,259
Just click on the link below


43
0:2:42,259 --> 0:2:46,819
So we're going to split this sauce and show you arrabiata, which is


44
0:2:46,819 --> 0:2:51,319
spicy, a bit like a pesto, really versatile. Let's put our pasta in because that's


45
0:2:51,319 --> 0:2:53,169
going to take ten minutes


46
0:2:53,169 --> 0:2:55,659
So this pasta that we're using here is fusilli.


47
0:2:55,659 --> 0:2:59,219
All those little twists


48
0:2:59,219 --> 0:3:3,789
really mop up the sauce, and you'll have gooey tomato sauce running


49
0:3:3,789 --> 0:3:5,269
through that pasta.


50
0:3:5,269 --> 0:3:8,309
Chop up some pancetta now


51
0:3:8,309 --> 0:3:10,359
So that's nice and warm


52
0:3:10,359 --> 0:3:12,439
You don't need any oil


53
0:3:12,439 --> 0:3:16,909
because this pancetta will just, it's got enough fat in it


54
0:3:16,909 --> 0:3:22,929
If you say you're arrabiata you're cross, you're angry, they call it that because it's


55
0:3:22,929 --> 0:3:24,779
fiery and


56
0:3:24,779 --> 0:3:27,439
spicy


57
0:3:27,439 --> 0:3:29,49
You don't want to get rid of that fat because it's full of


58
0:3:29,49 --> 0:3:32,179
flavour and saltiness and it's


59
0:3:32,179 --> 0:3:33,259
really good


60
0:3:33,259 --> 0:3:34,419
Look at those bits


61
0:3:34,419 --> 0:3:39,779
Nice and crispy and delicious


62
0:3:39,779 --> 0:3:44,479
If you're going to have an arrabiatta you want it nice and hot. Half a teaspoon of chilli flakes


63
0:3:44,479 --> 0:3:46,739
As you can see it's quite meaty


64
0:3:46,739 --> 0:3:48,579
thick sauce now.


65
0:3:48,579 --> 0:3:54,549
Just before I put the pasta in there I'm going to add a little bit of the pasta water.


66
0:3:54,549 --> 0:3:58,89
Come on Em's. I'm ready. We want 50/50 yeah?


67
0:3:58,89 --> 0:4:1,229
Marry the pasta on the heat.


68
0:4:1,229 --> 0:4:4,159
Always


69
0:4:4,159 --> 0:4:7,279
This one's your spicy Arrabiata


70
0:4:7,279 --> 0:4:10,47
And then the other one is really simple
we loved it as kids


71
0:4:10,47 --> 0:4:12,169
tuna and capers


72
0:4:12,169 --> 0:4:15,819
My tuna's gone in


73
0:4:15,819 --> 0:4:19,369
Capers will give it a little bit of saltiness 
and it goes really really well with


74
0:4:19,369 --> 0:4:20,38
the fish


75
0:4:20,38 --> 0:4:23,91
After our swimming lessons when we were kids, instead of going to the fish and chip shop like everyone else,


76
0:4:23,91 --> 0:4:28,49
we went home for a plate of pasta with tuna


77
0:4:28,49 --> 0:4:31,819
I want a drizzle of olive oil


78
0:4:31,819 --> 0:4:35,749
I'm going, I'm not waiting for you.


79
0:4:35,749 --> 0:4:43,9
I want parmesan on mine too.


80
0:4:43,9 --> 0:4:45,349
Yup, really good


81
0:4:45,349 --> 0:4:46,25
Chilli?


82
0:4:46,25 --> 0:4:50,289
Yup, it's got a hit. It's good.


83
0:4:50,289 --> 0:4:51,56
Ohhh, everytime


84
0:4:51,56 --> 0:6:51,56
You can try some of mine
