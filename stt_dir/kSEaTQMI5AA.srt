THOMAS MORTON: You notice the
soil here is super dark, and


3
0:0:7,41 --> 0:0:9,39
that is because in addition to
being surrounded by rebel


4
0:0:9,39 --> 0:0:12,77
groups, Goma also sits at the
base of an active volcano.


5
0:0:12,77 --> 0:0:24,94



6
0:0:24,94 --> 0:0:28,14
Even from the land up, this
area is just in a constant


7
0:0:28,14 --> 0:0:32,27
state of


8
0:0:32,27 --> 0:0:34,52
That woman's shirt says
Vagina Warrior.


9
0:0:34,52 --> 0:0:49,17



10
0:0:49,17 --> 0:0:51,66
Goma's the capitol city of the
North Kivu Province of the


11
0:0:51,66 --> 0:0:54,28
Democratic Republic of Congo,
and is situation in one of the


12
0:0:54,28 --> 0:0:57,17
world's worst geopolitical
neighborhoods.


13
0:0:57,17 --> 0:0:59,86
To the southeast, there's the
Rwandan border, which largely


14
0:0:59,86 --> 0:1:2,41
consists of mountain jungles
through which scores of Hutu


15
0:1:2,41 --> 0:1:6,2
militants passed in the wake of
the 1994 Rwandan genocide,


16
0:1:6,2 --> 0:1:8,28
fleeing the revenge of President
Paul Kagame's newly


17
0:1:8,28 --> 0:1:11,23
elected Tutsi government for
their role in the massacre.


18
0:1:11,23 --> 0:1:13,725
This armed migration directly
contributed to the escalation


19
0:1:13,725 --> 0:1:17,14
of the First and Second Congo
Wars, in which an estimated 5


20
0:1:17,14 --> 0:1:19,55
million people lost
their lives.


21
0:1:19,55 --> 0:1:21,67
It was also through this
transportation corridor that


22
0:1:21,67 --> 0:1:24,45
the Lord's Resistance Army,
led by the infamous Joseph


23
0:1:24,45 --> 0:1:27,24
Kony, crossed the border from
Uganda and drove deep into the


24
0:1:27,24 --> 0:1:28,565
heart of the Congo.


25
0:1:28,565 --> 0:1:31,76
While "Kony 2012" drew a lot
of criticism for being less


26
0:1:31,76 --> 0:1:34,0
than diligent when it came to
framing the quote unquote


27
0:1:34,0 --> 0:1:36,84

what it did reveal is that the


28
0:1:36,84 --> 0:1:39,42
best way to reach jungle-bound
dissidents wasn't through


29
0:1:39,42 --> 0:1:41,89
social media, but through
good, old fashioned

31
0:1:43,46 --> 0:1:46,47

decide to enter the DDR

THOMAS MORTON: So when the
United Nations extended an


38

invitation to embed with their
operation in several locations


39
0:2:3,79 --> 0:2:6,384

Repatriation, Reinsertion, and
Reintegration Program.


43
0:2:36,91 --> 0:2:40,14
The focus of the program is on
foreign commands that are

0:2:40,14 --> 0:2:42,28
operating in the Congo.


45
0:2:42,28 --> 0:2:46,28
There's national reintegration
programs which take over and


46
0:2:46,28 --> 0:2:48,14

into their


47
0:2:48,14 --> 0:2:49,2
communities of origin.


48
0:2:49,2 --> 0:2:54,93
The main approach that DDRRR
has for trying to convince


49
0:2:54,93 --> 0:3:0,4
voluntary surrenders for
subsequent repatriation is by


50
0:3:0,4 --> 0:3:1,87
radio sensitization.


51
0:3:1,87 --> 0:3:8,81
This involves using radio
messages over FM networks.

We provide them lodging, not
this best one that you may

to keep that temporarily so

and Uganda.


83
0:5:7,43 --> 0:5:11,35
There's a whole bunch of rebel
groups that kind of mix and


84
0:5:11,35 --> 0:5:13,81
merge and cross borders and
take over this place.


85
0:5:13,81 --> 0:5:14,59
It's a real mess.

The one most people know about,
the Lord's Resistance


87

Army, or LRA, are kind of the
most notorious for their


88
0:5:19,89 --> 0:5:22,11
tactics, for using child
soldiers, for abducting


89
0:5:22,11 --> 0:5:24,52

entire churches


90
0:5:24,52 --> 0:5:25,79

kilometers outside the city

closer to 10.

It's basically a permanent

We just hooked up with a troop
of Uruguay and UN soldiers who


109
0:6:10,91 --> 0:6:13,56
are going to give us a little
tour of the city--


110
0:6:13,56 --> 0:6:15,83
see what a town that's basically
spent 20 years at


111
0:6:15,83 --> 0:6:30,76
siege of rebel warfare
looks like


112
0:6:30,76 --> 0:6:33,25
Besides the fragmented Lord's
Resistance Army, the


113
0:6:33,25 --> 0:6:35,86
Democratic Republic of Congo
is also home to militant


114
0:6:35,86 --> 0:6:39,39
groups such as the Mai-Mai, the
Raia Mutomboki, and the


115
0:6:39,39 --> 0:6:42,7
Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Rwanda.


116
0:6:42,7 --> 0:6:44,8
But the greatest threat to
regional stability could very


117
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:47,31
well be a group known as M23.


118
0:6:47,31 --> 0:6:49,89
Led by Bosco Ntaganda,
affectionately known by his


119
0:6:49,89 --> 0:6:53,61
troops as the Terminator, M23
mostly consists of Congolese


120
0:6:53,61 --> 0:6:56,89
Tutsis who defected from the
army last April after alleging


121
0:6:56,89 --> 0:6:59,12
that the government in Kinshasa
had violated peace


122
0:6:59,12 --> 0:7:2,77
accords signed on March 23,
2009, in which members of the


123
0:7:2,77 --> 0:7:5,83
now defunct CNDP were be
absorbed into the country's


124
0:7:5,83 --> 0:7:9,3
regular army, the FRDC.


125
0:7:9,3 --> 0:7:12,7
The battle between M23 and
government troops has raged so


126
0:7:12,7 --> 0:7:14,53
wildly that the United Nations
has been forced to divert


127
0:7:14,53 --> 0:7:16,94
troops and resources sorely
needed elsewhere in the


128
0:7:16,94 --> 0:7:19,25
country in order to get the
government in Kinshasa a


129
0:7:19,25 --> 0:7:21,7
fighting chance.


130
0:7:21,7 --> 0:7:24,3
This, in turn, has created a
security vacuum in which many


131
0:7:24,3 --> 0:7:26,56
of the armed groups in the area
have rushed in to fill


132
0:7:26,56 --> 0:7:29,22
while reigniting the cycle of
old tribal conflicts that were


133
0:7:29,22 --> 0:7:31,91
never really stamped out
in the first place.


134
0:7:31,91 --> 0:7:34,37
These ethnic and geopolitical
tensions are, in turn,


135
0:7:34,37 --> 0:7:37,66
exacerbating an already raging
fight between local militias


136
0:7:37,66 --> 0:7:40,87
to control the illicit mining
of cassiterite, wolframite,


137
0:7:40,87 --> 0:7:43,935
and coltan, minerals essential
to the manufacturing of


138
0:7:43,935 --> 0:7:47,0
everything from smartphones
to jet engines to airbags.


139
0:7:47,0 --> 0:7:50,2



140
0:7:50,2 --> 0:7:53,22
Complicating matters further, it
is widely believed that M23


141
0:7:53,22 --> 0:7:54,67
is receiving aid from
the governments


142
0:7:54,67 --> 0:7:56,55
of Rwanda and Uganda.


143
0:7:56,55 --> 0:7:59,39
And it has been reported that
the FDRC has approached the


144
0:7:59,39 --> 0:8:2,19
Hutu Mai-Mai for aid in fighting
the largely Tutsi


145
0:8:2,19 --> 0:8:6,28

atrocities in Central Africa,


150
0:8:21,15 --> 0:8:23,69
I ordered a small number of

pursue the LRA.

fan of the UN, in general.


154
0:8:38,142 --> 0:8:40,12
The track record has
been spotty for


155
0:8:40,12 --> 0:8:46,71

0:8:46,71 --> 0:8:49,9
They're famous for bringing
the sex trade.


157
0:8:49,9 --> 0:8:50,69
It's basically anywhere
they set up shop.


158
0:8:50,69 --> 0:9:9,6



159
0:9:9,6 --> 0:9:11,74
As our team's tank patrol
policed the streets of Goma's


160
0:9:11,74 --> 0:9:14,89
poorest neighborhoods, as well
as power plants, airstrips,


161
0:9:14,89 --> 0:9:15,95
and crossroads--


162
0:9:15,95 --> 0:9:19,2
the kind of places a rebel army
would likely attack--


163
0:9:19,2 --> 0:9:21,59
it became clear the UN troops
were not preparing for a


164
0:9:21,59 --> 0:9:25,0
jungle assault, but for a
potential attack by M23 on


165
0:9:25,0 --> 0:9:26,25
Goma itself.


166
0:9:26,25 --> 0:9:30,39



167
0:9:30,39 --> 0:9:33,11
So obviously, the UN's here,
on what they describe as a


168
0:9:33,11 --> 0:9:34,57
peacekeeping mission.


169
0:9:34,57 --> 0:9:36,53
They're supposed to mediate
between all the different


170
0:9:36,53 --> 0:9:39,245
rebel groups and end the
factions of army.


171
0:9:39,245 --> 0:9:40,44
There's different sections.


172
0:9:40,44 --> 0:9:43,41
The Congolese army, the Rwandan
army, and the Ugandan


173
0:9:43,41 --> 0:9:44,3
armies do come in here.


174
0:9:44,3 --> 0:9:46,78
So it's supposed to be,
basically, the babysitter, the


175
0:9:46,78 --> 0:9:47,49
grown-ups here.


176
0:9:47,49 --> 0:9:50,2
At the time, you're in a tank
and they're soldiers.


177
0:9:50,2 --> 0:9:52,62
Little boy's like it, but it
makes it feel kind of a little


178
0:9:52,62 --> 0:9:55,55
weird, like you're in
an occupying army.


179
0:9:55,55 --> 0:9:57,91
I can't help but notice we've
only really been in town.


180
0:9:57,91 --> 0:10:1,35
And it's kind of weird just
to do a city patrol.


181
0:10:1,35 --> 0:10:5,0
It's almost more like you're
policing the local population


182
0:10:5,0 --> 0:10:7,43
than on the lookout
for rebel groups.


183
0:10:7,43 --> 0:10:9,41
Maybe there's something to be
said for trying to convince


184
0:10:9,41 --> 0:10:15,555
locals not to go take
up arms with M23.


185
0:10:15,555 --> 0:10:18,22
In the weeks that followed our
initial visit to Goma,


186
0:10:18,22 --> 0:10:21,59
skirmishes between M23,
Congolese troops, and the UN


187
0:10:21,59 --> 0:10:23,82
increased with regularity
at strategic locations


188
0:10:23,82 --> 0:10:26,46
surrounding the city, with
rebels even beginning to


189
0:10:26,46 --> 0:10:29,39
attack food, fuel, and supply
convoys into town.


190
0:10:29,39 --> 0:11:7,38



191
0:11:7,38 --> 0:11:10,74
Later, the UN invited our team
to visit a camp in Goma set up


192
0:11:10,74 --> 0:11:13,22
to house rebel combatants who
had recent surrendered to both


193
0:11:13,22 --> 0:11:15,94
the UN and FDRC.


194
0:11:15,94 --> 0:11:18,89
IAN ROWE: When escapees do come
out, they're typically,


195
0:11:18,89 --> 0:11:21,94
at the moment, received by a
community member that they


196
0:11:21,94 --> 0:11:25,485
perhaps cross in the road, or in
the jungle, on their route,


197
0:11:25,485 --> 0:11:31,9
or something like that, and
brought to the FRDC or to our


198

be kept in our transit camp

processed in terms of getting
their information, details,


201
0:11:43,7 --> 0:11:45,4

for their families.


202
0:11:45,4 --> 0:11:48,69
We make contact with the Amnesty
Commission in Uganda.


203
0:11:48,69 --> 0:11:52,52
And our counterparts in
Entebbe-Kampala will meet us


204
0:11:52,52 --> 0:11:56,97
at the airport and we'll do a
hand-over, after which they'll


205
0:11:56,97 --> 0:12:2,49
be reintegrated via whatever
systems Uganda has in place.

208
0:12:14,84 --> 0:12:18,11
IAN ROWE: From the women that
have been abducted and kept as


209
0:12:18,11 --> 0:12:21,3
bush wives, oftentimes the
reason that they're released


210
0:12:21,3 --> 0:12:23,91
is because they've been slowing
down the LRA group


211
0:12:23,91 --> 0:12:25,525
that they're associated with.


212
0:12:25,525 --> 0:12:29,15
And so the fighters in the group
made the decision that,


213
0:12:29,15 --> 0:12:33,4
for the purposes of allowing
them to be more rapid moving,


214
0:12:33,4 --> 0:12:35,53
they would release these
women and children.


215
0:12:35,53 --> 0:12:37,752
THOMAS MORTON: Now, when you
say bush wives, that's a


216
0:12:37,752 --> 0:12:40,42
polite way of saying, like,
sex slave, basically.


217
0:12:40,42 --> 0:12:40,92
IAN ROWE: Yes.


218
0:12:40,92 --> 0:12:44,535
These are women that have been
abducted and used for sex as


219
0:12:44,535 --> 0:12:49,305
porters, all these most negative
kind of uses that you


220

could enumerate.


221
0:12:51,26 --> 0:12:53,2
THOMAS MORTON: Built on the
ruins of a home previously


222
0:12:53,2 --> 0:12:56,32
belonging to deposed Congolese
dictator Joseph Mobutu, the


223
0:12:56,32 --> 0:12:59,38
camp was split along ethnic and
administrative lines with


224
0:12:59,38 --> 0:13:1,64
only a chain-link fence
separating Hutu and Tutsi


225
0:13:1,64 --> 0:13:4,13
fighters, who out in the bush
had been spilling each other's


226
0:13:4,13 --> 0:13:6,2
blood by the bucket
for decades.


227
0:13:6,2 --> 0:13:9,12
The camp in Goma's indicative
of the DRC's confusing


228
0:13:9,12 --> 0:13:10,64
geopolitical turmoil.


229
0:13:10,64 --> 0:13:12,78
Combatants staying at the campus
must first surrender


230
0:13:12,78 --> 0:13:16,13
and hand over their weapons to
UN or government troops, after


231
0:13:16,13 --> 0:13:19,35
which they are processed
and held for 72 hours.


232
0:13:19,35 --> 0:13:21,92
A portion of the residents are
from Rwanda, from which they


233
0:13:21,92 --> 0:13:25,46
fled to the DRC, joined a
militia, became hired guns,


234
0:13:25,46 --> 0:13:27,23
and now want to return home.


235
0:13:27,23 --> 0:13:30,6
Other campers are Congolese who
fought with local Hutu and


236
0:13:30,6 --> 0:13:32,31
Tutsi militias before
surrendering.


237
0:13:32,31 --> 0:13:35,24
But there is also a contingent
of Rwandan farmers who pose as


238
0:13:35,24 --> 0:13:37,53
ex-rebels in order to hitch a
free ride with the UN back


239
0:13:37,53 --> 0:13:39,2
across the boarder.


240
0:13:39,2 --> 0:13:41,56
To determine their status and
surmise their identities and


241
0:13:41,56 --> 0:13:44,6
countries of origin, they're
quizzed on local facts and


242
0:13:44,6 --> 0:13:46,94
subjected to fingerprinting
and retinal scans.


243
0:13:46,94 --> 0:13:49,93
The camp is an element of a UN
program designed to transform


244
0:13:49,93 --> 0:13:52,75
rebels into civilians,
reintegrating them back into


245
0:13:52,75 --> 0:13:55,18
society, or what's left of it.


246
0:13:55,18 --> 0:13:57,45
As the camp's public information
officer, Sam


247
0:13:57,45 --> 0:13:59,81
Howard, gave us a walking tour
of the side of the camp where


248
0:13:59,81 --> 0:14:3,19
some M23 fighters were housed,
it became apparent that no one


249
0:14:3,19 --> 0:14:5,82
from the UN wanted to talk to
our team about the confusing


250
0:14:5,82 --> 0:14:9,19
three-way battle raging between
the M23 mutineers, the


251
0:14:9,19 --> 0:14:11,35
UN, and the FDRC.


252
0:14:11,35 --> 0:14:14,27
They were, however, more than
happy to discuss other arm


253
0:14:14,27 --> 0:14:16,9
groups that are now less active,
such as Joseph Kony


254
0:14:16,9 --> 0:14:18,22
and his LRA fighters--


255
0:14:18,22 --> 0:14:21,87
just not the real rebels
standing next to us.


256
0:14:21,87 --> 0:14:24,36
The crumbling security situation
in North Kivu has


257
0:14:24,36 --> 0:14:27,47
forced the hand of the UN and
sparked a massive reallocation


258
0:14:27,47 --> 0:14:29,66
of UN assets to Goma
from places like


259
0:14:29,66 --> 0:14:31,37
Dungu, Duru, and Bangadi.


260
0:14:31,37 --> 0:14:34,875
In the Orientale Province,
places where the LRA were, and


261
0:14:34,875 --> 0:14:36,64

are active.

269
0:15:54,53 --> 0:16:11,38



270
0:16:11,38 --> 0:16:14,54
Beginning in September, 2008,
the Lord's Resistance Army


271
0:16:14,54 --> 0:16:17,89
launched a series of brutal
attacks in Dungu, kidnapping


272
0:16:17,89 --> 0:16:20,59
dozens, killing hundreds,
and displacing an


273
0:16:20,59 --> 0:16:23,96
estimated 87,000 people.


274
0:16:23,96 --> 0:16:27,2
In an unusual display of
brutality, the LRA fighters


275
0:16:27,2 --> 0:16:30,75
put aside their usual AK-47s
and RPGs in favor of the


276
0:16:30,75 --> 0:16:32,59
machete and club.


277
0:16:32,59 --> 0:16:35,16
This brutality is still being
felt in the damage to the


278
0:16:35,16 --> 0:16:37,26
area's already fragile
infrastructure.


279
0:16:37,26 --> 0:16:40,42
And with no standing power grid
or mobile phone network,


280
0:16:40,42 --> 0:16:43,64
the only reliable method of mass
communication are the FM

THOMAS MORTON: Our team first
saw examples of the UN PSYOPS


290
0:17:50,12 --> 0:17:53,27
flyers with Sam Howard back at
the transit camp in Goma.


291
0:17:53,27 --> 0:17:55,95
Each contain instructions in
several languages directing


292
0:17:55,95 --> 0:17:58,71
LRA and other rebel combatants
on the correction procedure


293
0:17:58,71 --> 0:18:1,47
for safely surrendering
for repatriation.


294
0:18:1,47 --> 0:18:4,42
First, if you find a flyer,
look for the correction FM


295
0:18:4,42 --> 0:18:6,6
radio station to tune into
for instructions of


296
0:18:6,6 --> 0:18:8,56
where you can surrender.


297
0:18:8,56 --> 0:18:11,53
Next, when the LRA goes to bed,
make your escape under


298
0:18:11,53 --> 0:18:13,24
the cover of darkness.


299
0:18:13,24 --> 0:18:17,19
Third, surrender to the UN,
FDRC, or another approved

the LRA's snatch and grab
tactics in the area, our UN

Bolobo, a young man who

IAN ROWE: The amnesty law that
used to allow those that came


439
0:31:52,46 --> 0:31:56,12
out of the LRA voluntarily
a degree of amnesty


440
0:31:56,12 --> 0:31:57,73
has now been removed.


441
0:31:57,73 --> 0:31:59,785
And so that's another issue
which has also been

0:31:59,785 --> 0:32:0,56
brought to the fore.


443
0:32:0,56 --> 0:32:4,73

THOMAS MORTON: For the purposes
of kind of disarming


458
0:33:17,77 --> 0:33:20,32
these people and getting them
to surrender, this ain't


459
0:33:20,32 --> 0:33:21,57
helping, you know?


460
0:33:21,57 --> 0:33:41,63



461
0:33:41,63 --> 0:33:44,1
European-style colonialism first
made its way into the


462
0:33:44,1 --> 0:33:47,92
Congo in 1876, after famed
explorer Henry Stanley,


463
0:33:47,92 --> 0:33:51,45
employed by Leopold II of
Belgium, forced tribal chiefs


464
0:33:51,45 --> 0:33:54,35
to sign treaties at gunpoint
that essentially granted all


465
0:33:54,35 --> 0:33:57,26
of their land rights to
the European monarch.


466
0:33:57,26 --> 0:34:1,33
Until 1908, Leopold ran the
Congo as the Congo-Free State,


467
0:34:1,33 --> 0:34:3,43
a private corporation
with him as the sole


468
0:34:3,43 --> 0:34:5,48
shareholder and as chairman.


469
0:34:5,48 --> 0:34:8,139
It soon became clear that the
corporation's profits were


470
0:34:8,139 --> 0:34:11,5
built on a brutal occupation
of the local people and


471
0:34:11,5 --> 0:34:13,53
plunder of the Congo's
natural resources--


472
0:34:13,53 --> 0:34:15,989
namely, rubber.


473
0:34:15,989 --> 0:34:19,429
In 1965, following a series of
coups that ended the relative


474
0:34:19,429 --> 0:34:22,28
stability of the newly
independent nation, Laurent


475
0:34:22,28 --> 0:34:25,56
Mobutu seized control of the
state, changed the country's


476
0:34:25,56 --> 0:34:29,13
name to Zaire, and for over 30
years, lead a brutal regime


477
0:34:29,13 --> 0:34:31,659
built on Mobutu's own
cult of personality.


478
0:34:31,659 --> 0:34:34,679
By way of example, under Mobutu
in a children's school,


479
0:34:34,679 --> 0:34:36,55
Ronald Reagan would have
been referred to as


480
0:34:36,55 --> 0:34:38,96
the American Mobutu.


481
0:34:38,96 --> 0:34:43,35
In May, 1997, Laurent Desire
Kabila, father of the DRC's


482
0:34:43,35 --> 0:34:45,929
current executive Joseph
Kabila, ascended to the


483
0:34:45,929 --> 0:34:48,239
presidency of Zaire and changed
the country's name,


484
0:34:48,239 --> 0:34:50,94
yet again, to the Democratic
Republic of Congo.


485
0:34:50,94 --> 0:34:53,17
Kabila the elder achieved this
regime change through a


486
0:34:53,17 --> 0:34:57,25
rebellion backed by Rwanda and
which included a grand march


487
0:34:57,25 --> 0:35:0,15
from the Kivus across 1,000
miles of some of the world's


488
0:35:0,15 --> 0:35:1,6
densest jungle--


489
0:35:1,6 --> 0:35:5,68
the same feat now threatened
by the rebels of M23.


490
0:35:5,68 --> 0:35:7,29
IAN ROWE: There's a very big
difference from the work that


491
0:35:7,29 --> 0:35:10,66
DDR does in the Kivus
to the work


492
0:35:10,66 --> 0:35:12,27
that they do in Orientale.


493
0:35:12,27 --> 0:35:16,72
Whereas in the Kivus, most of
the combatants that we're


494
0:35:16,72 --> 0:35:20,51
trying to reach are more
easily reachable.


495
0:35:20,51 --> 0:35:22,17
There's a mobile network
system here.


496
0:35:22,17 --> 0:35:24,7



497
0:35:24,7 --> 0:35:27,28
There's the possibility to reach
out and discuss and try


498
0:35:27,28 --> 0:35:29,5
to negotiate with people
to come in.


499
0:35:29,5 --> 0:35:32,8
That doesn't exist
in Orientale.


500
0:35:32,8 --> 0:35:33,3
Up there, you're in the
middle of the jungle.


501
0:35:33,3 --> 0:35:34,97
There's no more mobile
network.


502
0:35:34,97 --> 0:35:37,92
There's no contact with anybody
within the LRA.


503
0:35:37,92 --> 0:35:39,57
There's no peace agreement.


504
0:35:39,57 --> 0:35:42,526
So much of the work is based
a lot on the belief and the


505
0:35:42,526 --> 0:35:43,776
faith that the message is
getting through them.


506
0:35:43,776 --> 0:36:1,36



507
0:36:1,36 --> 0:36:4,56
There's now a new African Union
initiative to implement


508
0:36:4,56 --> 0:36:7,76
a strategy towards countering
the LRA problem.


509
0:36:7,76 --> 0:36:10,18
We also use our troops
on the ground when


510
0:36:10,18 --> 0:36:11,56
they do their patrols.


511
0:36:11,56 --> 0:36:14,97
So we make a point of having
only armed elements doing


512
0:36:14,97 --> 0:36:17,558
that, whether it's from
our side or the FRDC.


513
0:36:17,558 --> 0:36:33,14



514
0:36:33,14 --> 0:36:34,81
THOMAS MORTON: During the
patrol, we had persuaded the


515
0:36:34,81 --> 0:36:38,17
convoy to drop our team off in
Duru, a village hit hard by


516
0:36:38,17 --> 0:36:41,2
the LRA's 2008 Dungu
Offensive.


517
0:36:41,2 --> 0:36:44,43
It is also where, according to
local rumors, a small band of


518
0:36:44,43 --> 0:36:46,53
fighters have been recently
raiding local farms.


519
0:36:46,53 --> 0:36:58,218



520
0:36:58,218 --> 0:37:2,7
There goes our convoy.


521
0:37:2,7 --> 0:37:5,98
There's American J-Op Special
Forces here who are being a


522
0:37:5,98 --> 0:37:7,83
little bit cagey about
what they're doing.


523
0:37:7,83 --> 0:37:10,8
They just took off all of their
insignia before crossing


524
0:37:10,8 --> 0:37:16,246
into South Sudan, including
their little flag patch, which


525
0:37:16,246 --> 0:37:19,63
seems a little intriguing.


526
0:37:19,63 --> 0:37:22,84
There was a national policemen
from Burkina Faso.


527
0:37:22,84 --> 0:37:26,5
He confirmed what we have kind
of been picking up on this


528
0:37:26,5 --> 0:37:26,31
whole time.


529
0:37:26,31 --> 0:37:30,53
The LRA's weak and dead
at this point.


530
0:37:30,53 --> 0:37:32,94
I think it's kind
of hype-driven.


531
0:37:32,94 --> 0:37:37,8
I think the Kony 2012 Facebook
campaign thing has sort of


532
0:37:37,8 --> 0:37:40,4
swayed foreign policy towards
sending troops here instead of


533
0:37:40,4 --> 0:37:43,25
somewhere like Goma, where
there's a huge buildup of M23


534
0:37:43,25 --> 0:37:46,69
troops, which is basically where
we're kind of needed


535
0:37:46,69 --> 0:37:53,2
down here, instead of pursuing
this dead, sort of starving


536
0:37:53,2 --> 0:37:56,92
army of 400 people who
only attack, at this


537
0:37:56,92 --> 0:37:58,992
point, to get food.


538
0:37:58,992 --> 0:38:2,15
We'll hang out here and see
how people are doing four


539

distance and waited for
the moon to rise.


584
0:44:17,73 --> 0:44:20,75
After his first shot rang out
across the night sky, the LRA


585
0:44:20,75 --> 0:44:23,71
men, lulled into a false sense
of comfort, laid down their

607
0:45:42,91 --> 0:45:45,55
Almost everywhere we went, our
team seemed to encounter


608
0:45:45,55 --> 0:45:48,38
conflicting opinions regarding
the reallocation of troops and


609
0:45:48,38 --> 0:45:50,14
equipment across the country.


610
0:45:50,14 --> 0:45:52,37
Regions where the LRA were
still active feared the


611
0:45:52,37 --> 0:45:55,38
security vacuum the had been
left in by the UN and FDRC


612
0:45:55,38 --> 0:45:58,48
movement of troops in support
of the Kivus.


613
0:45:58,48 --> 0:46:1,92
Back in the Kivus, for fear of
showing of their hand to M23,


614
0:46:1,92 --> 0:46:4,69
officials chose to focus on
operations in provinces like


615
0:46:4,69 --> 0:46:6,89
Orientale while seemingly
ignoring the


616
0:46:6,89 --> 0:46:8,92
wolf at their doorstep.


617
0:46:8,92 --> 0:46:10,33
It seems that both fears
were well-founded.

0:47:2,55 --> 0:47:3,28
No hippos so far.


630
0:47:3,28 --> 0:47:6,42
I think they might still be
in the grass, which is


631
0:47:6,42 --> 0:47:8,72
disappointing, but also kind
of an apt metaphor


632
0:47:8,72 --> 0:47:10,58
for the LRA up here.


633
0:47:10,58 --> 0:47:13,26
One thing that's sort of
becoming clear, especially


634
0:47:13,26 --> 0:47:15,82
seeing all the NGOs here, all
the UN presence, all the


635
0:47:15,82 --> 0:47:18,85
different agencies, Invisible
Children are a good


636
0:47:18,85 --> 0:47:21,56
organization, despite the fact
that "Kony 2012" is a fucked


637
0:47:21,56 --> 0:47:22,45
up piece of shit.


638
0:47:22,45 --> 0:47:24,56
And there's this attitude that
you see with all sorts of


639
0:47:24,56 --> 0:47:26,91
NGOs, that they have, you know,
a very narrow focus.


640
0:47:26,91 --> 0:47:30,75
They're focused on one issue in
a region, which is the way


641
0:47:30,75 --> 0:47:31,51
you do things.


642
0:47:31,51 --> 0:47:33,16
You concentrate, and
you specialize.


643
0:47:33,16 --> 0:47:36,84
But in an area as complex
as Eastern Congo, where


644
0:47:36,84 --> 0:47:39,7
everything's connected, you
focus your troops up in the


645
0:47:39,7 --> 0:47:41,28
north, where the LRA is.


646
0:47:41,28 --> 0:47:44,5
You beat them in a manner of
speaking, but all they've


647
0:47:44,5 --> 0:47:47,63
really done is, as I keep
saying, atomize the troops.


648
0:47:47,63 --> 0:47:49,63
They split off into little
groups of one and three.


649
0:47:49,63 --> 0:47:50,86
They hid in the bush.


650
0:47:50,86 --> 0:47:54,29
And now taking them down as
a force is going to be


651
0:47:54,29 --> 0:47:54,72
impossible.


652
0:47:54,72 --> 0:47:56,22
It's going to take years
and years and years.


653
0:47:56,22 --> 0:47:58,17
These guys are going
to stay here, and


654
0:47:58,17 --> 0:48:0,42
they've reverted to banditry.


655
0:48:0,42 --> 0:48:2,89
At the same time, the groups in
the South, like the Mai-Mai


656
0:48:2,89 --> 0:48:6,1
and the M23, have taken
advantage of the focus of


657
0:48:6,1 --> 0:48:8,12
attention on LRA to build
up their forces.
