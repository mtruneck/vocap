###8 NARRATOR: People are getting killed in Karachi every day.
###10 There's gang violence, tons of mafia, sectarian killings, and
###14 in more recent years, suicide bombings.
###16 But for the political parties, it's a massive turf war.
###19 And while politicians and businessmen would never admit
###22 that they engage in assassinating their rivals,
###24 someone is hiring the so-called target killers.
###29 We wanted to interview one of the men responsible for this
###31 dirty work, so we arranged a meeting with a target killer.
###34 It was uncomfortable for everyone involved.
###37 We negotiated the terms of the interview--
###39 in a moving car and with his motorcycle helmet on.
###43 And not surprisingly, the guy who kills people for money--
###46 he wanted to get paid.

###229 INTERVIEWER: Thank you.
###230 
###233 MALE SPEAKER: Well, that was intense.
###234 INTERVIEWER: That was--
###235 
###239 yeah, that was really strange sitting next to someone who's
###248 killed 35 people.
###250 And you could just tell from his demeanor and from his
###252 eyes, he was a hard dude.
###254 And there's 600 guys like that roaming around the city.
###261 Anytime anyone has a beef to settle with someone else--
###264 they want to kill them-- just hire one of these guys and
###267 don't pay them that much money, and
###270 they'll do the work.
###271 It's lawless, wild, and chaotic here.
###275 
###277 And that is some scary shit.
