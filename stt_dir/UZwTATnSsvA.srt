1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,11



2
0:0:0,11 --> 0:0:2,7
MICHAEL HASTINGS: I had never
heard that level of disrespect


3
0:0:2,7 --> 0:0:5,26
directed towards the
commander-in-chief from an


4
0:0:5,26 --> 0:0:7,43
officer or any officer,
certainly.


5
0:0:7,43 --> 0:0:10,35
Guys on the ground, and this is
a very underreported story,


6
0:0:10,35 --> 0:0:12,43
you could go into Afghanistan
and do day after day of


7
0:0:12,43 --> 0:0:15,5
stories of quoting Marines,
quoting American soldiers


8
0:0:15,5 --> 0:0:16,32
trashing President Obama.


9
0:0:16,32 --> 0:0:17,22
Nobody does that.


10
0:0:17,22 --> 0:0:18,92
They did it for Bush in Iraq.


11
0:0:18,92 --> 0:0:21,25
When a soldier criticized
President Bush, it was news.


12
0:0:21,25 --> 0:0:23,86
So this criticising Obama
because of the media's love


13
0:0:23,86 --> 0:0:25,703
for Obama is not news.


14
0:0:25,703 --> 0:0:28,26



15
0:0:28,26 --> 0:0:29,32
BEN ANDERSON: McChrystal was
supposed to have gotten fired


16
0:0:29,32 --> 0:0:31,32
because of your piece
in Rolling Stone.


17
0:0:31,32 --> 0:0:33,1
Do you think he was fired
because of that piece?


18
0:0:33,1 --> 0:0:33,54
MICHAEL HASTINGS: No.


19
0:0:33,54 --> 0:0:36,825
I think there had been tensions
between the Pentagon


20
0:0:36,825 --> 0:0:38,12
and the White House.


21
0:0:38,12 --> 0:0:42,76
Was the Rolling Stone story the
excuse to fire this guy?


22
0:0:42,76 --> 0:0:44,926
Look, if he'd been winning the
war, and the president would


23
0:0:44,926 --> 0:0:47,86
have been happy with him, they
could have easily said, oh,


24
0:0:47,86 --> 0:0:49,33
it's Rolling Stone.


25
0:0:49,33 --> 0:0:50,77
People make mistakes.


26
0:0:50,77 --> 0:0:52,48
General McChrystal and his staff
didn't think they were


27
0:0:52,48 --> 0:0:55,27
going to get fired even when
the story came out.


28
0:0:55,27 --> 0:0:56,95
They thought the story was
going to be worse,


29
0:0:56,95 --> 0:0:57,79
according to them.


30
0:0:57,79 --> 0:0:59,76
I had overheard this other
comment, which


31
0:0:59,76 --> 0:1:1,19
was very, very bad.


32
0:1:1,19 --> 0:1:2,64
BEN ANDERSON: From McChrystal
himself?


33
0:1:2,64 --> 0:1:4,12
MICHAEL HASTINGS: From
one of his guys.


34
0:1:4,12 --> 0:1:5,41
I can't even go into
what it was,


35
0:1:5,41 --> 0:1:6,81
because it's so explosive.


36
0:1:6,81 --> 0:1:10,48
So to see these senior military
officials criticize


37
0:1:10,48 --> 0:1:13,7
the president not only in front
of me, but in front of


38
0:1:13,7 --> 0:1:17,64
staffs of dozens,
I think was--


39
0:1:17,64 --> 0:1:18,855
they questioned the judgment.


40
0:1:18,855 --> 0:1:19,14
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.


41
0:1:19,14 --> 0:1:20,36
Everything came out
in the book.


42
0:1:20,36 --> 0:1:21,956
You named people you
hadn't named in the


43
0:1:21,956 --> 0:1:22,115
Rolling Stone article.


44
0:1:22,115 --> 0:1:22,38
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Sure.


45
0:1:22,38 --> 0:1:23,86
BEN ANDERSON: Well, did
you get a reaction


46
0:1:23,86 --> 0:1:24,98
from the guys featured?


47
0:1:24,98 --> 0:1:26,56
MICHAEL HASTINGS: The book
critically did quite well.


48
0:1:26,56 --> 0:1:28,67
It was well received.


49
0:1:28,67 --> 0:1:32,3
Really positive response in
terms of consumers and


50
0:1:32,3 --> 0:1:33,68
whatnot, actually.


51
0:1:33,68 --> 0:1:41,21
The most overt volley from the
sort of Pentagon was this


52
0:1:41,21 --> 0:1:43,38
review in the Wall Street
Journal, which they had a


53
0:1:43,38 --> 0:1:47,26
military contractor who worked
for Petraeus and General


54
0:1:47,26 --> 0:1:50,86
Caldwell and was an unofficial
advisor to General McChrystal


55
0:1:50,86 --> 0:1:52,34
trashed the book in the
Wall Street Journal


56
0:1:52,34 --> 0:1:53,32
in the first day.


57
0:1:53,32 --> 0:1:55,12
And he didn't disclose that
he actually worked


58
0:1:55,12 --> 0:1:57,56
for all these generals.


59
0:1:57,56 --> 0:1:59,37
So that's how they operate.


60
0:1:59,37 --> 0:2:1,11
They had made attempts over
the previous year.


61
0:2:1,11 --> 0:2:3,71
There had been two, actually
three Pentagon investigations


62
0:2:3,71 --> 0:2:5,3
into my work.


63
0:2:5,3 --> 0:2:7,7
They had made pretty serious
attempts to try to undermine


64
0:2:7,7 --> 0:2:8,53
the reporting in
Rolling Stone.


65
0:2:8,53 --> 0:2:11,24
I bet they felt on some level
they were making progress


66
0:2:11,24 --> 0:2:14,35
there, but I think that with
the success of the book and


67
0:2:14,35 --> 0:2:16,38
the fact that no one has
disputed anything in the book.


68
0:2:16,38 --> 0:2:18,57
No one has ever-- has yet to
dispute any facts in the


69
0:2:18,57 --> 0:2:19,19
original story.


70
0:2:19,19 --> 0:2:21,26
BEN ANDERSON: Whenever you meet
anyone from the very top


71
0:2:21,26 --> 0:2:23,24
guy to the very bottom guy,
nothing is off the record.


72
0:2:23,24 --> 0:2:24,15
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Yeah.


73
0:2:24,15 --> 0:2:24,27
BEN ANDERSON: That's
one of the first


74
0:2:24,27 --> 0:2:24,88
things they tell you.


75
0:2:24,88 --> 0:2:25,13
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Yeah.


76
0:2:25,13 --> 0:2:27,85
You actually have to sign a
piece of paper when you go on


77
0:2:27,85 --> 0:2:29,8
embed that says everything
is on the record.


78
0:2:29,8 --> 0:2:30,87
And it was interesting.


79
0:2:30,87 --> 0:2:33,47
Complicit in this were my
colleagues in the Washington


80
0:2:33,47 --> 0:2:37,82
Pentagon Press Corps, who would
just sort of take this


81
0:2:37,82 --> 0:2:41,95
bullshit that the Pentagon was
feeding them and run stories,


82
0:2:41,95 --> 0:2:45,65
not calling for comments from
me, not even reading the


83
0:2:45,65 --> 0:2:47,9
reports that they were quoting
from and characterizing.


84
0:2:47,9 --> 0:2:50,21
So this is me complaining about
my Pentagon colleagues.


85
0:2:50,21 --> 0:2:52,68
BEN ANDERSON: I think I was in
Afghanistan and someone said


86
0:2:52,68 --> 0:2:54,983
you'd applied for an embed
and been denied


87
0:2:54,983 --> 0:2:55,82
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Right.


88
0:2:55,82 --> 0:2:55,932
BEN ANDERSON: --an embed.


89
0:2:55,932 --> 0:2:56,23
That's true?


90
0:2:56,23 --> 0:2:57,33
MICHAEL HASTINGS: I had already
been approved for an


91
0:2:57,33 --> 0:3:0,79
embed, and I don't think
the military knew.


92
0:3:0,79 --> 0:3:2,33
ISAF didn't even
know about it.


93
0:3:2,33 --> 0:3:5,32
And then I was doing a talk,
and someone asked me, well,


94
0:3:5,32 --> 0:3:6,41
how is your relationship
with the military?


95
0:3:6,41 --> 0:3:8,67
I said, actually, I talk to
soldiers all the time, and in


96
0:3:8,67 --> 0:3:11,58
fact, I'm going on an
embed next month.


97
0:3:11,58 --> 0:3:13,9
They sent in, someone did a
blog post within 24 hours.


98
0:3:13,9 --> 0:3:16,75
Apparently my name is in Google
Alerts somewhere.


99
0:3:16,75 --> 0:3:18,47
I got a letter that said,
because of your story about


100
0:3:18,47 --> 0:3:21,5
General McChrystal and the
political fallout, you're no


101
0:3:21,5 --> 0:3:24,2
longer allowed to come over
unless you get like four


102
0:3:24,2 --> 0:3:25,31
written sworn statements.


103
0:3:25,31 --> 0:3:27,4
And it was a headquarters
thing.


104
0:3:27,4 --> 0:3:30,16
BEN ANDERSON: I was reading
before the fuss it caused, you


105
0:3:30,16 --> 0:3:31,52
still thought this
would make a--


106
0:3:31,52 --> 0:3:32,46
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Oh,
yeah, yeah, yeah.


107
0:3:32,46 --> 0:3:34,14
And I interviewed them for
hours and hours when


108
0:3:34,14 --> 0:3:34,9
I was on this trip.


109
0:3:34,9 --> 0:3:36,95
I knew after day two of them
that I want to write a book


110
0:3:36,95 --> 0:3:37,67
about them.


111
0:3:37,67 --> 0:3:39,5
BEN ANDERSON: And
they knew that?


112
0:3:39,5 --> 0:3:39,73
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Yeah,
I'd make jokes


113
0:3:39,73 --> 0:3:40,53
about it all the time.


114
0:3:40,53 --> 0:3:42,35
And one of the interesting
things was they were sort of


115
0:3:42,35 --> 0:3:43,74
holding out access.


116
0:3:43,74 --> 0:3:45,81
They were playing this game with
a variety of reporters,


117
0:3:45,81 --> 0:3:48,42
some big names, about who was
going to get the best access


118
0:3:48,42 --> 0:3:49,58
for the book projects.


119
0:3:49,58 --> 0:3:50,9
BEN ANDERSON: Because someone
was going to do the official


120
0:3:50,9 --> 0:3:53,9
biography of McChrystal, which
was going to be a big seller.


121
0:3:53,9 --> 0:3:55,17
MICHAEL HASTINGS: So this was
sort of the carrot they were


122
0:3:55,17 --> 0:3:56,33
putting out there for me.


123
0:3:56,33 --> 0:3:58,293
BEN ANDERSON: You know, they
seemed excited by the idea of


124
0:3:58,293 --> 0:4:0,82
having a Rolling Stone
journalist as opposed to Wall


125
0:4:0,82 --> 0:4:2,66
Street Journal, or Washington
Post, or New York Times.


126
0:4:2,66 --> 0:4:5,5
McChrystal said, my kids want
me to be on the cover of


127
0:4:5,5 --> 0:4:5,34
Rolling Stone.


128
0:4:5,34 --> 0:4:8,49
So you feel like you've change
the course of the war in


129
0:4:8,49 --> 0:4:10,1
Afghanistan or changed policy?


130
0:4:10,1 --> 0:4:11,62
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Well, a lot
of this story is actually


131
0:4:11,62 --> 0:4:14,47
about how counter-insurgency
doesn't work.


132
0:4:14,47 --> 0:4:17,79
We can take credit for sort of
cementing that narrative or at


133
0:4:17,79 --> 0:4:21,45
least making it very obvious
that this is a real problem.


134
0:4:21,45 --> 0:4:21,74
Great.


135
0:4:21,74 --> 0:4:22,68
BEN ANDERSON: Michael,
thank you very much.


136
0:4:22,68 --> 0:4:23,93
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Later, man.


137
0:4:23,93 --> 0:6:23,93
