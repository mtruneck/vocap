0:0:2,67 --> 0:0:5,85
DALE TALDE: The halo-halo
is our one dessert.


3
0:0:5,85 --> 0:0:7,445
It's our only dessert
right now.


4
0:0:7,445 --> 0:0:12,45
"Halo-halo" really means
"mix-mix." And it is a funkier


5
0:0:12,45 --> 0:0:15,59
Filipino version of a
flavored snow cone.


6
0:0:15,59 --> 0:0:17,72
In the Philippines, typically
it's topped up with, like,


7
0:0:17,72 --> 0:0:20,11
Rice Krispies that are like
the bootleg version.


8
0:0:20,11 --> 0:0:21,1
They're not even in a box.


9
0:0:21,1 --> 0:0:21,57
They're in the bag.


10
0:0:21,57 --> 0:0:24,14
They're like on the bottom
shelf, and they're in the bag.


11
0:0:24,14 --> 0:0:25,6
And it's like, hey,
man, I looked at--


12
0:0:25,6 --> 0:0:27,36
I was like, if I'm going
to put cereal on this.


13
0:0:27,36 --> 0:0:29,12
I'm going to put like
dope cereal on it.


14
0:0:29,12 --> 0:0:30,26
I'm going to put Cap'n Crunch.


15
0:0:30,26 --> 0:0:32,42
It's my favorite.


16
0:0:32,42 --> 0:0:34,41
Seriously, dude, some people
get it, some people


17
0:0:34,41 --> 0:0:35,71
just don't get it.


18
0:0:35,71 --> 0:0:38,18
Well, people who do love it,
they take a bite of it, and


19
0:0:38,18 --> 0:0:40,17
there's this instant
childhood memory.


20
0:0:40,17 --> 0:0:41,56
And you could tell that it
clicks with some people.


21
0:0:41,56 --> 0:0:44,3
And when it doesn't,
you're just like--


22
0:0:44,3 --> 0:0:45,53
you had like granola
and yogurt, right?


23
0:0:45,53 --> 0:0:46,795
Your parents were hippies
or some shit.


24
0:0:46,795 --> 0:0:48,21
And they didn't give
you crappy cereal.


25
0:0:48,21 --> 0:0:49,96
Because I grew up on that,
and I love that shit.

DALE TALDE: Hi.


29
0:1:6,423 --> 0:1:8,39
My name is Dale Talde.


30
0:1:8,39 --> 0:1:11,855
This is Talde Restaurant,
Park Slope, Brooklyn.


31
0:1:11,855 --> 0:1:14,586
The food here at Talde
is Asian-American.


32
0:1:14,586 --> 0:1:18,41
It's holding on to some of these
very traditional dishes


33
0:1:18,41 --> 0:1:22,78
and then giving it a Brooklyn,
local, American feel to it.


34
0:1:22,78 --> 0:1:26,515
The neighborhood needed not
just regular Tom Yum soup


35
0:1:26,515 --> 0:1:28,82
because they can get that in
any Thai place around here.


36
0:1:28,82 --> 0:1:30,7
They wanted something more.


37
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:33,77



38
0:1:33,77 --> 0:1:34,723
I love Pad Thai.


39
0:1:34,723 --> 0:1:35,59
It's my thing.


40
0:1:35,59 --> 0:1:37,79
So I put brunch and
Pad Thai together.


41
0:1:37,79 --> 0:1:40,262
And then I will just gild the
lily a little bit and add some


42
0:1:40,262 --> 0:1:42,738
more oysters to it.


43
0:1:42,738 --> 0:1:44,96
If I was hung over
and--like today--


44
0:1:44,96 --> 0:1:47,79
and to fix me up, to
me, Pad Thai is the


45
0:1:47,79 --> 0:1:49,11
perfect hangover food.


46
0:1:49,11 --> 0:1:50,37
It's starch.


47
0:1:50,37 --> 0:1:52,125
It's greasy.


48
0:1:52,125 --> 0:1:54,73
It soaks up all the poison.


49
0:1:54,73 --> 0:1:56,13
And when I thought about it,
I was like, you know what?


50
0:1:56,13 --> 0:1:59,8
For me, if I could have it for
brunch, I would every day.


51
0:1:59,8 --> 0:2:1,26
First restaurant
job was Outback


52
0:2:1,26 --> 0:2:5,28
Steakhouse, Bloomin' Onions.


53
0:2:5,28 --> 0:2:7,535
I was absolutely terrible.


54
0:2:7,535 --> 0:2:9,35
Pretty bad when you get stoned
before you go to work.


55
0:2:9,35 --> 0:2:11,77
And then you're trying to work
a station, and you're not


56
0:2:11,77 --> 0:2:13,48
really good at cooking
as it is.


57
0:2:13,48 --> 0:2:15,8
And you're trying
to do it stoned.


58
0:2:15,8 --> 0:2:19,3
Didn't work out too well.


59
0:2:19,3 --> 0:2:24,52
I love what I do, but I don't
take myself too seriously.


60
0:2:24,52 --> 0:2:26,96
Top Chef gave me enormous
opportunities.


61
0:2:26,96 --> 0:2:27,71
I mean, you get to travel.


62
0:2:27,71 --> 0:2:30,14
You get to meet tons
of cool people.


63
0:2:30,14 --> 0:2:33,42
I mean, Dave recognized me
walking into Enoteca, where at


64
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:36,64
the time he was the GM and
recognized me because he


65
0:2:36,64 --> 0:2:37,28
watched the show.


66
0:2:37,28 --> 0:2:39,98
And honestly, if I hadn't gone
on the show, I probably won't


67
0:2:39,98 --> 0:2:43,0
be here right now.


68
0:2:43,0 --> 0:2:46,55
So last night, David Massoni,
my partner, and John Bush,


69
0:2:46,55 --> 0:2:48,31
bartender and owner--


70
0:2:48,31 --> 0:2:50,65
at the end of the shift
we went to Franny's.

0:2:51,485 --> 0:2:52,275

am hungry, too.

we're coming?


75
0:2:54,6 --> 0:2:56,44

know we're coming.

0:2:56,44 --> 0:2:59,41

0:2:59,41 --> 0:3:1,6
DALE TALDE: You don't need
to go to Manhattan.


78
0:3:1,6 --> 0:3:1,795
You really don't.


79
0:3:1,795 --> 0:3:4,86
I mean, if you want to eat well,
stay at the borough of


80
0:3:4,86 --> 0:3:7,188
Brooklyn because they're
doing a killer job.


81
0:3:7,188 --> 0:3:10,604



82
0:3:10,604 --> 0:3:11,92
MARTIN GOBBEE: Yeah.


83
0:3:11,92 --> 0:3:12,7
Should we seat you, guys?


84
0:3:12,7 --> 0:3:13,502
DAVID MASSONI: Shall we go ahead
and have a seat, yeah?

0:3:13,502 --> 0:3:14,31

it going?


86
0:3:14,31 --> 0:3:15,9
Dale, Dale Talde.


87
0:3:15,9 --> 0:3:16,29
It's nice to meet you.


88
0:3:16,29 --> 0:3:18,19
He was a fucking
big dude, man.


89
0:3:18,19 --> 0:3:19,75
If he came around my kitchen,
I was like--


90
0:3:19,75 --> 0:3:20,65
I don't know.


91
0:3:20,65 --> 0:3:22,73
I'm not exactly the tallest
dude in the world, man.


92
0:3:22,73 --> 0:3:23,98
You got to be like 6'4".


93
0:3:23,98 --> 0:3:26,68



94
0:3:26,68 --> 0:3:28,62
DANNY AMEND: Franny's is
definitely a southern Italian


95
0:3:28,62 --> 0:3:29,98
restaurant.


96
0:3:29,98 --> 0:3:32,48
We do make hand noodles, but
most of our noodles are dry,


97
0:3:32,48 --> 0:3:33,62
which is what you
would typically


98
0:3:33,62 --> 0:3:36,58
find in southern Italy.


99
0:3:36,58 --> 0:3:39,47
So this is definitely my
favorite dish right now.


100
0:3:39,47 --> 0:3:42,49
And it might be my favorite
Franny's dish ever--


101
0:3:42,49 --> 0:3:44,28
real basic citrus salad.


102
0:3:44,28 --> 0:3:45,545
Growing up in California--


103
0:3:45,545 --> 0:3:47,59
I'm from northern California.


104
0:3:47,59 --> 0:3:51,445
My mom had a satsuma tangerine
tree that grow on our deck.


105
0:3:51,445 --> 0:3:53,6
And I used to eat this
all the time.


106
0:3:53,6 --> 0:3:55,836
So it tastes a little
bit like home.


107
0:3:55,836 --> 0:3:58,4
When I finish it,
it has parsley.


108
0:3:58,4 --> 0:4:1,75
It has red onion, pistachios,
hot peppers that we


109
0:4:1,75 --> 0:4:3,12
pickle in the house.


110
0:4:3,12 --> 0:4:6,9
So it's got a lot
more soul to it.


111
0:4:6,9 --> 0:4:8,665
DALE TALDE: I mean their level
of execution in what they're


112
0:4:8,665 --> 0:4:10,31
doing is so spot on.


113
0:4:10,31 --> 0:4:14,34
They were the benchmark for
what we hope to be.


114
0:4:14,34 --> 0:4:17,779
They are destination restaurant
on Flatbush Ave.--


115
0:4:17,779 --> 0:4:21,5
on Flatbush Ave., like four
blocks away from where the


116
0:4:21,5 --> 0:4:23,15
Mets are going to
play next year.


117
0:4:23,15 --> 0:4:24,78
People are coming out to see
them because the food is


118
0:4:24,78 --> 0:4:25,33
fucking dope.


119
0:4:25,33 --> 0:4:27,58
And they're doing a good job.


120
0:4:27,58 --> 0:4:29,18
They're doing everything
in-house.


121
0:4:29,18 --> 0:4:30,86
You can tell.


122
0:4:30,86 --> 0:4:34,54
DANNY AMEND: Spigarello, which
is basically broccoli leaf.


123
0:4:34,54 --> 0:4:36,92
For me, I never had it before
I came to Franny's.


124
0:4:36,92 --> 0:4:40,1
And that's another cool thing
about the restaurant is we do


125
0:4:40,1 --> 0:4:44,27
a lot of things that most
people have never had.


126
0:4:44,27 --> 0:4:46,19
DALE TALDE: Mm.


127
0:4:46,19 --> 0:4:47,81
It's so fucking good.


128
0:4:47,81 --> 0:4:49,325
It's like the best cool
flavor I've ever had.


129
0:4:49,325 --> 0:4:52,468



130
0:4:52,468 --> 0:4:53,81
What we're doing is
just a craft.


131
0:4:53,81 --> 0:4:55,53
With them, you could tell
that the level of


132
0:4:55,53 --> 0:4:58,4
craftsmanship is so high.


133
0:4:58,4 --> 0:4:59,61
Hopefully, we can get there.


134
0:4:59,61 --> 0:5:2,39
I mean, we're working
hard every day.


135
0:5:2,39 --> 0:5:4,7
This is the fucking pasta
I want to do.


136

0:5:13,295 --> 0:5:14,68

you wish you were Italian.

145
0:5:18,632 --> 0:5:20,105
DAVID MASSONI: Cheers, guys.


146
0:5:20,105 --> 0:5:22,26
The first night out since we
opened the restaurant--


147
0:5:22,26 --> 0:5:23,62
DALE TALDE: --together.


148
0:5:23,62 --> 0:5:25,865
And it depends on the level
of sobriety on that.


149
0:5:25,865 --> 0:5:27,185
It's what I want to eat.


150
0:5:27,185 --> 0:5:29,11
So I've had two whiskeys.


151
0:5:29,11 --> 0:5:31,15
I'm being somewhat civilized.


152
0:5:31,15 --> 0:5:33,85
And if I've gone on to, like
three or four, then I'm really


153
0:5:33,85 --> 0:5:39,45
starting to get into the gross,
uncivilized pizza with


154
0:5:39,45 --> 0:5:42,48
a ton a ranch and sriracha.


155
0:5:42,48 --> 0:5:45,5
And it's total blasphemy,
but I'm down.


156
0:5:45,5 --> 0:5:50,72



157
0:5:50,72 --> 0:5:52,85
I've got dope fat kid moves--


158
0:5:52,85 --> 0:5:55,785
making a box of mac and cheese,
eating half of it, and


159
0:5:55,785 --> 0:5:58,6
then saving the hot sauce
for the last half.


160
0:5:58,6 --> 0:5:59,88
So all of a sudden it tastes
different and shit.


161
0:5:59,88 --> 0:6:3,67
So like, oh, no, I have
a new mac and cheese.


162
0:6:3,67 --> 0:6:6,58



163
0:6:6,58 --> 0:6:7,865
Somebody farted.


164
0:6:7,865 --> 0:6:9,2
DAVID MASSONI: It wasn't me.

0:6:12,87 --> 0:6:15,27
DALE TALDE: From Franny's we
jumped in a cab and went to


169
0:6:15,27 --> 0:6:20,3
Pearl's Social Club in Bushwick,
deep in Bushwick--


170
0:6:20,3 --> 0:6:25,294
those mad handlebar mustaches
and really tight pants.


171
0:6:25,294 --> 0:6:27,96
Goddamn, in the borough,
you could tell, like


172
0:6:27,96 --> 0:6:29,78
Monday is for pros.


173
0:6:29,78 --> 0:6:31,96
Friday and Saturday is for
amateurs, and Monday is for


174
0:6:31,96 --> 0:6:34,79
the pros to go out because it
was like all industry folks.


175
0:6:34,79 --> 0:6:37,516
And it was two, three
at the bar deep.


176
0:6:37,516 --> 0:6:38,711
DAVID MASSONI: Hi, can I have
three shots of Jamesons and


177
0:6:38,711 --> 0:6:40,384
three Tecates?


178
0:6:40,384 --> 0:6:41,818
DALE TALDE: People are
drinking cheap beer.


179
0:6:41,818 --> 0:6:44,15
And I was like good, this is
getting fucked up, but I'm


180
0:6:44,15 --> 0:6:45,28
having a good time.


181
0:6:45,28 --> 0:6:46,75
And it's awesome.


182
0:6:46,75 --> 0:6:48,844
That bar is awesome.


183
0:6:48,844 --> 0:6:51,279
DAVID MASSONI: To hanging
out again.


184
0:6:51,279 --> 0:6:54,201
Salud.


185
0:6:54,201 --> 0:6:56,86
DALE TALDE: So we all did a shot
of Jameson, drank a beer.


186
0:6:56,86 --> 0:6:59,32
And then Betsy, who
owns the bar--


187
0:6:59,32 --> 0:7:2,48
awesome, awesome person-- she
made us a cocktail and made it


188
0:7:2,48 --> 0:7:3,73
with the tobacco bitters.


189
0:7:3,73 --> 0:7:6,18



190
0:7:6,18 --> 0:7:8,1
JOHN BUSH: What are
these called?


191
0:7:8,1 --> 0:7:9,54
BETSY MAHER: Red dawn.


192
0:7:9,54 --> 0:7:11,94
DALE TALDE: America,
fuck yeah!


193
0:7:11,94 --> 0:7:13,15
And that was it for me.


194
0:7:13,15 --> 0:7:15,44
That was the--


195
0:7:15,44 --> 0:7:17,612
you get to that point, and you
just know that it's the end of


196
0:7:17,612 --> 0:7:18,9
your night?


197
0:7:18,9 --> 0:7:19,46
And that was the end
of the night.


198
0:7:19,46 --> 0:7:20,705
And we were only like 2/3.

0:7:20,705 --> 0:7:21,425

Can somebody get

0:7:25,36 --> 0:7:26,16
Dale a glass of water?


203
0:7:26,16 --> 0:7:27,554
DALE TALDE: It's
like that big.


204
0:7:27,554 --> 0:7:28,804
DAVID MASSONI: A
glass of water?


205
0:7:28,804 --> 0:7:32,274



206
0:7:32,274 --> 0:7:33,218
DALE TALDE: I feel like
a lot of pressure.


207
0:7:33,218 --> 0:7:35,12
Like, I have to actually
cook for people now.


208
0:7:35,12 --> 0:7:37,825
And I'm going to get shit-faced
and now, I have to


209
0:7:37,825 --> 0:7:38,56
fucking cook.


210
0:7:38,56 --> 0:7:40,6
JOHN BUSH: So Betsy, you want
to come back and have some


211
0:7:40,6 --> 0:7:41,17
food with us tonight?


212
0:7:41,17 --> 0:7:43,28
We got some grub munchies.


213
0:7:43,28 --> 0:7:45,46
DALE TALDE: And we asked all the
guys, Martin, the chef of


214
0:7:45,46 --> 0:7:47,99
Franny's, Betsy to come on in.


215
0:7:47,99 --> 0:7:50,481
Hey, Bill, so we're
on our way back.


216
0:7:50,481 --> 0:7:54,2
DAVID MASSONI: [LAUGHTER]


217
0:7:54,2 --> 0:7:55,634
JOHN BUSH: You better
be good, man.


218
0:7:55,634 --> 0:7:57,55
I'm hungry and I
got to go bed.


219
0:7:57,55 --> 0:7:58,5
DALE TALDE: Not really.


220
0:7:58,5 --> 0:8:0,6
I'm not really prepared
to cook shit.


221
0:8:0,6 --> 0:8:2,31
I've been cooking
fucking all day.


222
0:8:2,31 --> 0:8:4,27
Now, I'm rundown.


223
0:8:4,27 --> 0:8:6,45
I told my guys there better
be like 3 pounds of butter


224
0:8:6,45 --> 0:8:9,6
outside so I can make something
fucking taste good.


225
0:8:9,6 --> 0:8:10,73
Brought it back here.


226
0:8:10,73 --> 0:8:15,44
And to be honest with you, I
hope it tasted good because I


227
0:8:15,44 --> 0:8:17,382
remember very little what
the fuck happened.


228
0:8:17,382 --> 0:8:21,28



229
0:8:21,28 --> 0:8:24,5
Planning some black
bean lobster--


230
0:8:24,5 --> 0:8:25,455
uh, I'm sorry, black
bean clams.


231
0:8:25,455 --> 0:8:27,22
Where the fuck is everything?


232
0:8:27,22 --> 0:8:29,278
Chow fun noodles--


233
0:8:29,278 --> 0:8:31,27
I don't have the clams.


234
0:8:31,27 --> 0:8:34,9
Clams seem to not be here.


235
0:8:34,9 --> 0:8:39,816



236
0:8:39,816 --> 0:8:43,28
No, I've no fucking idea what
I'm planning to do right now.


237
0:8:43,28 --> 0:8:46,84
[LAUGHTER]


238
0:8:46,84 --> 0:8:50,63
I do not recommend using a wok
when you're fucking hammered.


239
0:8:50,63 --> 0:8:54,535
They're about 180,000 btus,
jet flames that


240
0:8:54,535 --> 0:8:55,87
pop out of that wok.


241
0:8:55,87 --> 0:8:59,4
It's taken ice from ice to
boiling in 4 minutes.


242
0:8:59,4 --> 0:9:1,88
Do a little hot sauce.


243
0:9:1,88 --> 0:9:5,45
Cooking is about fire and food
and the application of heat


244
0:9:5,45 --> 0:9:8,44
and/or salt and/or whatever.


245
0:9:8,44 --> 0:9:11,31
But I'm not one of those
cooks that are subtle.


246
0:9:11,31 --> 0:9:13,61
And my food's always been "punch
in your face" flavors.


247
0:9:13,61 --> 0:9:15,63
I will sacrifice the
way something looks


248
0:9:15,63 --> 0:9:17,506
over taste any day.


249
0:9:17,506 --> 0:9:22,34



250
0:9:22,34 --> 0:9:24,79
Chili black bean, brown
butter clams.


251
0:9:24,79 --> 0:9:27,45



252
0:9:27,45 --> 0:9:35,51
"Nooder?" Did anybody ask for
some "nooders?" Chow fun


253
0:9:35,51 --> 0:9:36,97
"nooder?"


254
0:9:36,97 --> 0:9:39,72
I gotta serve you guys.


255
0:9:39,72 --> 0:9:42,19
You guys hooked us up.


256
0:9:42,19 --> 0:9:46,56
A little red-cooked pork shank
with the chow fun noodle,


257
0:9:46,56 --> 0:9:50,45
charred red cabbage, and
some bean sprouts.


258
0:9:50,45 --> 0:9:54,87
This restaurant is
my last name.


259
0:9:54,87 --> 0:9:57,51
It's kind of a tribute to my
family and my mom and my dad,


260
0:9:57,51 --> 0:9:59,7
who've helped me get
to where I am.


261
0:9:59,7 --> 0:10:3,38
When we ate celebratory meals,
it was always like--


262
0:10:3,38 --> 0:10:6,58
it was my mom and eight of her
sisters and her entire family.


263
0:10:6,58 --> 0:10:8,31
So it was all of us getting
together and eating.


264
0:10:8,31 --> 0:10:11,77
You have to love that part of
restaurants, that atmosphere


265
0:10:11,77 --> 0:10:14,17
of hospitality and cooking
for others and


266
0:10:14,17 --> 0:10:15,64
doing all for others.


267
0:10:15,64 --> 0:10:17,74
Making people happy, that's
what it's about.


268
0:10:17,74 --> 0:10:23,119



269
0:10:23,119 --> 0:10:32,72
[MUSIC PLAYING]


270
0:10:32,72 --> 0:12:32,72
