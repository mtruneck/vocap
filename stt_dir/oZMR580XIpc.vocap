###3 ALAN SEALES: This show is very unique, and partially
###5 why I enjoy it so much is because I feel like this
###8 is more musicians on stage versus actors more or less.
###12 I mean, do you guys find a distinction in that?
###16 ANDY TAYLOR: Somebody else talk.
###18 JOANNA CHRISTIE: It does feel like playing in a band,
###20 for a lot of the show.
###21 But we're all pretty much primarily actors,
###26 I think, really, that just play instruments as well.
###30 So I don't know.
###31 There's no distinction.
###32 It's all blurred.
###34 We're doing what the show requires,
###36 which is acting and playing and singing.
###37 ARTHUR DARVILL: On my tax return, I put actor/musician.
###40 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###42 JOANNA CHRISTIE: If that helps.
###44 ANDY TAYLOR: I have to say, I've done a show-- if you're like,
###47 oh, it's so amazing.
###47 There are shows where the actors play instruments.
###50 I was in one that won all the words.
###52 And it was Sam Mendes who did "American Beauty"
###54 and it was his "Cabaret."
###55 And they're reviving it actually recently.
###57 But that was much more like a couple of hot Kit Kat girls
###62 who quit playing violin in fifth grade.
###65 And then they were in the band later on.
###67 Whereas these guys could all-- sure,
###68 we could all actually play our instruments
###71 pretty much before we got the gig.
###73 We've learned to play other things more, but we're actors,
###77 but all of us have had that 10-year immersion
###80 thing where we got good at something.
###81 ALAN SEALES: So do you enjoy playing your own instruments
###84 on stage more than playing with a band.
###86 ARTHUR DARVILL: Yeah.
###88 I've never been in a band that's this big before.
###92 I've always had a dream of having a massive band.
###94 And suddenly, I've got it.
###97 It's great.
###98 And it keeps it fresh and alive.
###101 It's slightly different every night,
###103 because someone's in a bad mood or someone breaks a string.
###107 ALAN SEALES: Well, what happens, then,
###108 if you guys break a string?
###109 Do you just say stop the show, I gotta' restring.
###112 PAUL WITTY: Well, we do theater.
###113 We do theater.
###114 We're used to it.
###117 Stuff goes wrong every night.
###118 The audience never realizes it, but stuff is always
###121 going wrong.
###122 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###123 PAUL WITTY: And like all the little things that go wrong,
###125 we hear it, and we see it, and we
###126 know kind of what's happening.
###128 But it's all about improv-ing in that moment
###131 and staying with it.
###132 BROWN SHIRT BACK: And there's contingency plans for that.
###135 Like, if Arthur breaks a string during the very first song,
###137 there's somebody else that's assigned
###139 to pick up that song, to pick up the guitar on that song.
###142 I mean, there's a whole list of who
###143 takes what when a string breaks.
###145 So for the sake of the sound guys
###147 not going "who the hell's playing?
###148 Oh God," we have an actual contingency plan.
###151 ALAN SEALES: Right.
###153 How many of you guys are original cast?
###155 Are any of you?
###156 BROWN SHIRT BACK: Yes.
###157 ALAN SEALES: So you recorded the soundtrack not
###162 in isolation booths, right?
###163 
###166 PAUL WITTY: Yeah, well, we did it with Steve Epstein,
###170 was the producer of the album.
###171 And he had just done an album with Yo-Yo Ma and Chris Seeley.
###175 He did the goat rodeo sessions.
###178 And the way they recorded that album,
###182 it was like they did it in like a farmhouse.
###185 And they all sat in the same room
###186 and played together, rather than each being in isolation booth,
###189 listening with headphones.
###191 So Martin, our music director and Steve Epstein,
###195 kind of got together and they decided
###197 that that's kind of what they wanted to do with this.
###199 And make sure that it felt like we were all
###202 playing together, rather than playing to a track.
###204 And so hopefully, what came off was a very kind
###208 of raw session sounding-like thing.
###211 ALAN SEALES: Yeah, that was another question I guess I had.
###214 I was thinking about it.
###215 The music is so raw.
###217 And I think it's written and designed to sound like that
###219 and to come together in that sort of thing.
###221 But it's well rehearsed and the pre-show music, the pre-show
###225 that you guys do, you have set songs.
###227 Do you do the same songs in the pre-show every time?
###230 ANDY TAYLOR: Yeah, anybody else?
###232 ADAM WESLEY BROWN: Well, we have a rotating list
###234 of about 20 or 30 Irish and Czech folk songs.
###237 And part of the cool thing about, like Arthur was saying,
###240 about being in a band is that you come in every night,
###243 and right where you sign in, they normally
###245 have a list of the songs that are going up that night.
###247 So it's like you come in and find out
###249 what the set list is before you go out
###250 and get on with the band.
###251 DAVID PATRICK KELLEY: And when we started,
###253 we were asked to bring in songs.
###256 And so we contributed a lot of them, the things we had.
###260 And you know, the thing that's great about
###263 is it gives-- you know, there've been other shows where
###265 musicians have played, but it gives you ownership.
###268 You really feel like you're participating.
###270 I know you here at Google know a lot
###272 about the strategy of making people
###274 feel like they're participating.
###275 And that really helps us.
###277 We own the songs.
###278 We help express the other characters' emotions as well as
###281 our own when we step on to do it.
###284 But the songs, in particular, in the beginning are meaningful.
###289 If you've brought them in, and just by happenstance
###292 they wanted things that weren't such Irish cliches,
###295 and it comes from John Tiffany, our director, and from Glen
###300 Hansard, of course, the pub culture, where
###304 people would get in the pub and if you couldn't express
###306 your emotions through words, you could sing it.
###308 And so that's the idea of that.
###312 ALAN SEALES: Oh, and we have microphones in the aisles
###314 if you guys want to ask questions from the audience.
###316 ARTHUR DARVILL: We'll sing.
###317 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###318 ALAN SEALES: Or sing.
###319 ANDY TAYLOR: (MOCK DEEP VOICE) Well,
###320 the problem with that is--
###323 ALAN SEALES: The choreography, as well, in the show
###326 is very, very unique.
###327 And I haven't seen anything like it.
###329 And I quite enjoyed the choreography,
###331 How did that come about?
###332 It was a lot of improv to start, right?
###335 ANDY TAYLOR: Yes, Steven Hoggett is our movement
###339 director/choreographer.
###340 And why are you guys laughing?
###343 Zygo, why don't you answer it, Zygo?
###346 J. MICHAEL ZYGO: Sure, in the process
###347 of creating the show-- I'm one of them all.
###349 I feel like I'm hiding behind everybody-- people
###353 were asked to contribute movements.
###355 And all of the movement is based on the emotion.
###358 It's very rooted in the motion of everything.
###360 And there's nothing like, you'll see in "Newsies," where there's
###363 pas de bourree, turn, turn, turn, kick, you know.
###366 ANDY TAYLOR: We're not "Newsies."
###368 J. MICHAEL ZYGO: We're not "Newsies."
###369 ANDY TAYLOR: Cause no one could.
###370 We would put it in if we could do it.
###373 J. MICHAEL ZYGO: But yeah, it's all
###374 meant to enhance and kind of embellish upon the music.
###378 And so everything is really cohesive
###380 and works together, so that you never
###382 notice one thing more than the other.
###384 And everything is just kind of an accent to everything else.
###388 ANDY TAYLOR: Right.
###389 If I may, Hoggett broke us up in Boston
###391 when we did this workshop and not really
###393 knowing what was going to happen with the show.
###395 Hoggett broke us up into groups and said, you're bored,
###399 you're sitting at a table.
###400 And we can just come up with a story of a couple of gestures
###403 that you could teach one another.
###404 And so we would all do it in our little groups.
###406 And those little pods of actors came back and taught movement
###409 to everybody else.
###411 And I'd say 60% or 70% of certain songs
###414 are all extrapolated from movement that people came in
###418 within that little session.
###420 And they were like, you're bored.
###421 It wasn't specific, but then in the bank scene,
###423 when they're trying to get money from this sort
###426 of jaded old banker, they awaken.
###428 Their little gestures that they make that are very small,
###431 but they're very, very powerful in capturing
###435 the emotional essence of the scene or the music
###438 in a very simple gesture, like a classic iconic move
###442 or something.
###442 And it's all from the actors.
###444 ALAN SEALES: Is it all set now?
###444 ANDY TAYLOR: It's all set now.
###445 But it was found material from the actors.
###450 Steven Hoggett's has got a company in the UK
###452 called Frantic Assembly.
###453 And I don't know, like 15 years or something.
###455 And it's really established and really well known in the UK.
###458 And it's totally like his signature, his style.
###461 If you see all their work is really similar to this.
###464 It's all like what Zygo was saying
###465 about from an emotional place.
###467 It's not just move your arm here and then
###469 it's all right, gut rolling.
###470 It's amazing to watch.
###472 J. MICHAEL ZYGO: And then one of the other challenges
###474 was creating choreography that people could do well
###476 playing instruments, like the end of Act One.
###478 That song we just played "Gold."
###480 Every one of us who was playing that song and singing it
###482 is also dancing.
###485 And I remember the first day I got into rehearsal down
###487 at the New York Theater Workshop,
###488 I was the only new guy there.
###490 And they'd all already established most of it.
###492 And the first thing we did on the first day
###493 was started to learn the choreography for "Gold."
###495 And I was already intimidated, but then I looked over
###498 across the room, and this guy's got
###499 a cello strapped to his chest.
###500 And I'm like is that guy dancing with a cello?
###503 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###504 J. MICHAEL ZYGO: What the hell is this?
###506 ANDY TAYLOR: Not well.
###507 I didn't have to do either play, sing or dance particularly
###511 well, obviously.
###512 ALAN SEALES: You have a cello harness.
###513 ANDY TAYLOR: Yeah, we kind of invented it.
###515 PAUL WITTY: I want to tell the story about when
###516 we were learning "Gold" in Cambridge and all
###519 in fear of losing our jobs because we couldn't dance
###521 and play instruments at the same time,
###524 and Andy was particularly freaking out
###526 because he was like, well, I don't
###527 want to get cut out of this number.
###528 He's like I got a fricking cello.
###529 It's like what am I going to do.
###531 So he had a belt on, took his belt off, wrapped it
###534 around his neck and he tied it to the cello.
###536 And I was like that is baller.
###538 It was so good.
###540 And I was like, all right, if he can figure out
###542 a way to dance with his cello, I think
###543 I can figure out a way to do it with my guitar.
###545 And it was inspiring to see everyone
###547 sort of rising to the occasion.
###550 It was a lot of new demands and we fueled each other that way.
###554 You'd see someone sort of rising to it, and like OK.
###556 Yeah, I should do that too.
###557 ARTHUR DARVILL: It's great the moment
###558 that you-- I'm looking out towards the audience.
###559 You guys are all dancing.
###560 But as soon as you start dancing,
###562 I see people just going, oh my god, look [WHISPERING] doing.
###565 (AMERICAN ACCENT) Oh, that's amazing.
###567 
###572 ALAN SEALES: You're saying, the choreography
###574 represents emotion, and it represents
###576 the meaning behind the songs, right?
###578 So I mean every night, like show after show,
###580 you do eight shows a week.
###581 I mean, it's got to be very emotionally taxing.
###583 Because this is about anonymous guy and girl,
###586 but the whole ensemble-- you guys
###589 are all very involved and onstage constantly.
###593 ANDY TAYLOR: I think that's an underrated tas-- I mean,
###597 it is trickier than it looks to just night after night,
###601 just be sort of detached, be an audience member.
###603 ADAM WESLEY BROWN: I will say that I think all of us
###605 are big fans of not only the story that is told,
###609 but the movie that was a hit, that won the awards, and also
###613 Glen and Marketa's music.
###615 I know for a fact that myself, when I first
###617 saw the movie years and years ago, it struck me in such a way
###621 that I said if there's ever a show or something like that,
###624 I got to be a part of it.
###625 But I think it fuels us each night,
###627 like we were talking about with the pre-shows set list,
###630 But as well with this company of people,
###632 I mean, we all love what we do so much
###635 and have so much damn fun doing it that it really never-- I
###639 mean, sure, It gets tiring because you
###641 do it eight show a week.
###642 And we hang out with each other all the time.
###644 And we get on each other's nerves.
###645 And it's like a family though.
###647 And it's really lovely to go out.
###649 I think we're very blessed in that we
###651 get to go out every night and tell the story
###653 and sing these songs.
###654 And people are so moved afterwards,
###656 that it kind of keep us going.
###658 I don't think there's ever a time we go, oh, I
###661 don't want to go into work today.
###663 ANDY TAYLOR: Except today, apparently.
###665 
###670 I mean, most of the time, I agree
###671 we usually are really eager to get to work.
###674 ADAM WESLEY BROWN: Laugh it up, laugh it up, fuzzball.
###676 Laugh it up.
###678 ANDY TAYLOR: Sorry, he missed out on the tour of lunch.
###681 So he missed out.
###682 ARTHUR DARVILL: I was going to say the guys who
###684 started the original cost of this,
###686 you've done over 600 shows.
###690 And it's like I've never done that many shows a day.
###693 I've never done anything that many times at all.
###697 DAVID PATRICK KELLY: Yeah, it's a blessing, you know.
###699 As an actor, for 43 years you can't-- when you're in a hit.
###704 It's so rare.
###706 And the thing about this show is that so many things
###708 came together, like an aligning of the stars.
###711 As Joanna said, Steven Hoggett had
###713 this company Frantic Assembly.
###715 They did the same kind of work with actors and tables
###717 and chairs for many years, 20 years or so.
###720 But it wasn't until this, until something really came together
###723 that was bigger than everybody.
###725 And they all have that look on their faces
###728 where we've discovered something that nobody quite owns
###731 but we all do beyond all of us.
###733 And Tiffany came when we moved to Broadway, finally.
###738 We started in Cambridge with 100 seats.
###740 And then when we were moved to Broadway,
###741 he, almost tears in his eyes, came up to us,
###743 and said we may close early.
###744 And it may not get very far.
###746 But we've come this far, and it's really great.
###748 And nobody knew that we would go on like that.
###751 ALAN SEALES: You won Best Musical.
###753 DAVID PATRICK KELLY: Say it again?
###754 ALAN SEALES: And then you won Best Musical.
###754 DAVID PATRICK KELLY: Yeah, best musical.
###756 But the idea of people playing their own instruments
###759 and telling a story that since Elvis, since the Beatles,
###764 on and on, blues folks forever, the drama
###768 of holding your own instrument and telling a story there
###770 is really intense.
###771 And we've known it for a long time.
###773 And it has this global impact.
###775 I see people on the line afterwards,
###776 when we're talking to folks, from around the world.
###779 And some don't speak English.
###781 And they're still moved, because they
###783 know the iconography of this images
###786 there, all the different characters.
###788 And so it's really the thing that is beyond us all.
###797 ALAN SEALES: Oh yes, question.
###799 AUDIENCE: So, I apologize, I haven't seen the show yet.
###801 Clearly, I have to go see it.
###801 MALE VOICE: Yes, you do.
###802 AUDIENCE: I notice it seems like it's the kind of show that
###805 would be the kind of thing you want
###806 to do in a 100-seat theater, with like an intimate thing.
###809 What was it like moving something
###810 like that, where you're breaking the fourth wall so
###812 much, to Broadway where you've got
###813 this-- all these people and all this stuff going on.
###816 DAVID PATRICK KELLY: Well, we were scared.
###816 We had to have workshops when they had workshops
###819 with the vocal coach to fill that theater,
###821 to try to bus it up.
###823 And once we're relaxed and got into it, we understood.
###825 It was OK.
###825 It was a natural thing.
###827 That's amazing that it really didn't change that much
###829 from 100 seats to this big theater.
###831 It really did not adjust that much.
###833 A few lines came and went.
###834 Things like that.
###835 But it just sort of blossomed all along the way.
###838 And you just had to adjust a little bit.
###840 PAUL WITTY: At New York Theatre Workshop,
###842 it was a 200-seat house.
###843 You know, it was very intimate.
###844 And in Cambridge, even less.
###846 I think it was about 100 in that little place.
###850 And so, I mean, all of us were quite worried about the move
###853 uptown and into an 1,100-seat theater and what that was going
###857 to do to the delicacy and the intimacy of the show.
###860 But I think, in fact, it had the opposite effect
###863 that we felt it was going to have.
###864 Rather than the show sort of overwhelm New York Theater
###868 Workshop, it overwhelmed that 200-seat house, because there
###871 was so much sort of happening on that stage,
###873 even thought it was a very delicate story.
###875 And I think in the bigger space, it feels much more delicate.
###878 It feels ooh, look at that little thing up there.
###880 ALAN SEALES: I think there's more energy to share.
###882 Because when I watch it, even in like the sound check earlier,
###886 I was stressed out, herding all you guys together,
###888 straggling in.
###889 And I sit and then all of a sudden, you guys start playing.
###891 And I'm captivated by the energy coming off the stage.
###894 ARTHUR DARVILL: The nicest thing about the way
###895 the play works as well.
###896 I mean, you guys haven't seen-- well,
###898 you watched it the other day.
###900 You haven't seen it, but I watched before I was in it.
###905 And I was amazed by-- you go to a Broadway show,
###908 and you're like, oh wow!
###909 It's very funny-- it's very different to London.
###912 I walked in and the ushers were like (CARNIVAL BARKER TONES)
###914 welcome to the show of your life!
###916 And you're like oh wow.
###917 OK, great.
###918 We're going to have a riot in here.
###921 And then you sit down, and this very, very quiet show starts.
###925 And you're like is meant to be humming?
###927 And then you're just completely sold.
###929 It's mesmerizing.
###931 It's an amazing thing to be part of.
###933 We kind of play with that on stage,
###935 bring you down as far as we can without people--
###938 but it's amazing.
###939 You see people just lean in-- you can hear a pin drop--
###942 and listen.
###943 And when it works-- there's moments when it really works--
###946 it's amazing to be--- yeah.
###949 ALAN SEALES: We've got time for one question,
###951 then we got to get out of here unfortunately.
###953 AUDIENCE: This is a question for Joanna and Arthur.
###956 Just wondering what I was like coming in
###958 and being replacements for the original cast.
###961 What it was like, if you had the opportunity
###963 to reinvent the characters yourself.
###965 I've seen the show a couple different times,
###967 so I know it's a little different with you
###968 guys as the leads, and great, I may add.
###970 JOANNA CHRISTIE: We had total freedom.
###973 We barely rehearsed.
###974 ARTHUR DARVILL: We barely rehearsed.
###976 We just learned it and did it.
###977 JOANNA CHRISTIE: John Tiffany, our director, was amazing.
###981 We learned and rehearsed the music back in England,
###983 while we were waiting for our visas to come through.
###985 And then we got two days notice that we
###988 were coming, that we were actually flying.
###990 So they called us on Friday and said,
###991 we booked your flights on Sunday.
###993 We were both OK.
###993 And then they're like, and your first show's on Friday.
###996 We were like what?
###997 ARTHUR DARVILL: We had two rehearsals, one [INAUDIBLE].
###998 JOANNA CHRISTIE: We had two rehearsals with these guys,
###999 and then the dress rehearsal, and then we were on.
###1001 
###1004 John Tiffany's very clever, I think,
###1006 because actually we both found that liberating,
###1007 as opposed to scary.
###1008 We found it freeing.
###1008 ARTHUR DARVILL: That's also like John's very, as a director
###1011 that we had some-- hey.
###1013 
###1019 As a director, John is amazing.
###1028 I don't know if any of you've seen "Glass Menagerie" yet.
###1030 If you haven't, go and see it.
###1032 It's the most amazing-- and it's the same team
###1034 who put together this.
###1037 And I said to John after, so I said,
###1038 how did you get those guys to act so well?
###1041 And he was just, I just let them get
###1043 on with it, which is him doing himself down completely,
###1048 because it's not as easy as that.
###1050 But he has this way of just empowering actors
###1053 to make you feel like you can do anything
###1055 and that you can be confident.
###1057 JOANNA CHRISTIE: And also he didn't try and replace--
###1059 I mean, obviously we're both so different from Cristin
###1061 and Steve anyway.
###1062 And I think he was clever in not trying to just
###1065 find reincarnations of them as actors.
###1070 He just started from scratch almost,
###1072 and just looked for the relationship between the two
###1076 characters, as opposed to trying to find another Cristin
###1078 and find another Steve and see if it works,
###1080 because it just wouldn't.
###1081 And when we were auditioning-- so
###1085 we flew over here for our last audition.
###1087 And we saw the show, which could have been a horrendous mistake,
###1090 as I was watching Cristin being amazing.
###1092 And I was like, oh God, I've got to try and do this tomorrow.
###1095 But John came to me before my audition
###1097 and he said, just do what you did in London.
###1100 And so it gave me the confidence to go,
###1102 OK, I can't try and be Cristin.
###1103 I can't do that.
###1104 So I just have to have faith in what I do.
###1108 And so, yeah, we were given a lot of freedom.
###1110 And that was liberating.
###1111 ARTHUR DARVILL: Yeah, the material can be [INAUDIBLE].
###1113 And the character's called Guy and Girl, you know what I mean?
###1116 I'm really excited about coming back in 10 years
###1118 time and watching other people do it.
###1120 And I think it's those kind of part-- you'll still be there.
###1125 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###1127 ANDY TAYLOR: I'm the only one with three children.
###1129 
###1133 ALAN SEALES: Well, we are at time.
###1135 And unfortunately, we have to wrap this up.
###1137 But the show is currently playing at the Jacobs Theater
###1140 here in town.
###1141 Go to OnceAMusical.com to get your tickets.
###1144 And everybody go please see it.
###1146 It's amazing.
###1146 The whole show was incredible.
###1148 Thank you guys so much.
###1149 AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
