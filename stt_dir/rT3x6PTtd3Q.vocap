###0 gallup has are released its of latest report on obesity in america and they
###4 have found out which states are the most obese and which states are the most
###8 healthy so why are we going to take a look at the eleven states with the
###12 lowest obesity rates
###14 colorado comes in at number one on the eighteen point seven percent of the
###17 residence in colorado are peace coming in number two is massachusetts and
###21 montana connecticut california new tires on a rhode island idaho new jersey
###26 and washington mom sound anne as you know i'm not surprised that colorado's
###31 lotto
###31 hippies biking karun
###33 ride and windows
###34 those guys it i don't know why but i feel like colorado their all super
###37 fidelity in the mountains
###40 the green in that
###41 and they don't work hard at work in the lines are all on by x
###45 drawing malcolm's
###46 of a big believer yet colorado make sense that present resembles a lot of
###51 translate means
###53 we favor top ten year rightly so um... you know i i'd look at the margin of air
###57 with this gallup study and i think that they're underestimating the margin of
###61 error and all discuss why in just a little bit but al let's look at the ten
###64 states with the highest obesity agreed sentiment
###67 coming in a number one is of west virginia in fact in west virginia i has
###71 been the most of the state
###73 for the third year
###75 uh... coming in over to his mississippi than arkansas louisiana alabama kentucky
###79 tennessee of high oklahoma and i wanna unity secure anyway that was a pattern
###84 here
###85 okay nida self is a very well represented
###89 and they're almost allred states
###91 bell-violin said that i wasn't but there you know they're purple
###96 is so it's
###97 and i know i've been in west virginia excitement
###99 we were at the end of the most part of that
###102 they sell six on top of that that
###106 patients dogs dogs
###111 seventy and i was prepared for the pratt state three years of war
###116 that's incredible
###117 um... while just to give you an idea of you know what we're dealing with overall
###122 about twenty six point two percent
###124 of the united states is all these
###126 however i do have an issue with the way that they did the study now i have the
###130 study was basically based on self reporting
###132 they called about three hundred fifty thousand americans in all fifty states
###136 uh... hands-off reporting already makes me a little skeptical of the results
###140 that they also uh... ask for their front and their weight so they can calculate
###145 b_m_i_
###146 the issue of the sea bass at v_m_i_'s we always do you agree to solve this
###150 v_m_i_'s bs
###152 they dislike super strong gusting kentucky west virginia right
###156 that fault lines
###158 nowpublic really the other thing that is is is all of those things are poor
###162 and i wanted to leave therefore you are the more likely you are to be obese is
###166 very ironic when you think about it
###169 but it makes sense this you're jumping it was mostly courtroom who
###175 seagram's fast food is really cheap
###177 i go six happens in west virginia i think they were ridiculous if you
###180 remember boost
###182 two dollars three dollars but couldn't believe how
###184 well was it may be why it's it's not that good
###187 you know i couldn't possibly permission but before i i i believe those numbers i
###191 think that
###191 you know they might not be exactly right but within the right context
###195 i think some of those
###196 statistics with a few more outdoor activities in opening a groovy serotypes
###199 aside
###200 uh... they're more likely to be fair
###202 in the states where there's a lot of poverty they likely to be more of these
###205 yep definitely in and uh... and of course in
###208 you always know that it's about
###210 what you eat like healthy nutrition means more attend the exercising too
###215 exercise is good to keep your muscles healthy your bones health the
###219 abut
###219 at the end of the day the most important thing is what you put in your body and
###222 what you eat
###223 so you can you'd like
###225 the six hot dogs and and do a little bit of exercise the exercise means nothing
###230 site and by the winters in connecticut california massachusetts
###233 so the richest states in the country there on the most fit
###237 cop so
###238 as part of it
