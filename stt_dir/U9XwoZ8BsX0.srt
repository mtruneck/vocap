1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:5,832



2
0:0:5,832 --> 0:0:7,79
ANTWUAN DIXON: What
you want to do?


3
0:0:7,79 --> 0:0:8,83
Go trip by the pool?


4
0:0:8,83 --> 0:0:9,835
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


5
0:0:9,835 --> 0:0:11,85
ANTWUAN DIXON: And talk?


6
0:0:11,85 --> 0:0:13,501



7
0:0:13,501 --> 0:0:15,66
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].


8
0:0:15,66 --> 0:0:21,1



9
0:0:21,1 --> 0:0:23,41
Got my little weights
out there.


10
0:0:23,41 --> 0:0:26,8
I already worked out
this morning.


11
0:0:26,8 --> 0:0:29,63
I woke up at 7:00, and then I
was going to go to the park,


12
0:0:29,63 --> 0:0:34,62
but those fools didn't
want to go.


13
0:0:34,62 --> 0:0:37,47
Fucking hot out here, man.


14
0:0:37,47 --> 0:0:38,19
Shits cool, right?


15
0:0:38,19 --> 0:0:39,34
You like it-- the house?


16
0:0:39,34 --> 0:0:40,52
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


17
0:0:40,52 --> 0:0:41,11
ANTWUAN DIXON: [COUGHING]


18
0:0:41,11 --> 0:0:43,26
It's cool.


19
0:0:43,26 --> 0:0:45,81
I just be chilling.


20
0:0:45,81 --> 0:0:48,47
So I wake up early, since
I don't drink


21
0:0:48,47 --> 0:0:51,195
normally, like I used to.


22
0:0:51,195 --> 0:0:53,42
I'll probably have, like,
a beer or some


23
0:0:53,42 --> 0:0:55,46
shit, but that's nothing.


24
0:0:55,46 --> 0:0:58,95
You know, just like
poolside chilling.


25
0:0:58,95 --> 0:1:1,7
You're sitting by the pool,
you got to have


26
0:1:1,7 --> 0:1:2,61
a beer and a blunt.


27
0:1:2,61 --> 0:1:5,69
That's like mandatory,
you know?


28
0:1:5,69 --> 0:1:8,55
It's not how I used
to get wasted.


29
0:1:8,55 --> 0:1:10,45
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome
back to the show.


30
0:1:10,45 --> 0:1:12,28
Since we started the show,
there's a short


31
0:1:12,28 --> 0:1:13,99
list of people that--


32
0:1:13,99 --> 0:1:16,2
like, dream episodes.


33
0:1:16,2 --> 0:1:19,66
And I think Antwuan Dixon, for
me, is one of those people


34
0:1:19,66 --> 0:1:21,71
that just like really blew
up-- came out with


35
0:1:21,71 --> 0:1:22,78
the "Baker 3" video.


36
0:1:22,78 --> 0:1:24,4
No one had ever heard of him.


37
0:1:24,4 --> 0:1:26,96
At the premiere, people were
yelling at the screen,


38
0:1:26,96 --> 0:1:28,81
standing on their seats.


39
0:1:28,81 --> 0:1:31,85
It was a really triumphant
entrance into skating.


40
0:1:31,85 --> 0:1:33,95
Antwuan Dixon is a legend.


41
0:1:33,95 --> 0:1:37,42
I mean, from the tattoos all
over his face to him being one


42
0:1:37,42 --> 0:1:39,61
of the most gifted
skateboarders--


43
0:1:39,61 --> 0:1:41,36
and you'll see from this
footage, he goes to this


44
0:1:41,36 --> 0:1:44,8
contest, and people
just swarm him.


45
0:1:44,8 --> 0:1:47,47
Kids are like breaking it off,
and Antwuan comes in--


46
0:1:47,47 --> 0:1:48,8
no skateboard--


47
0:1:48,8 --> 0:1:50,11
nothing--


48
0:1:50,11 --> 0:1:52,33
and almost, like, wins
the contest.


49
0:1:52,33 --> 0:1:53,53
Shows up--


50
0:1:53,53 --> 0:1:54,74
kids are worshipping him.


51
0:1:54,74 --> 0:1:58,22
Older skaters are trying to give
him drugs and alcohol.


52
0:1:58,22 --> 0:2:2,44
And it was like he emerged from
the contest victorious.


53
0:2:2,44 --> 0:2:6,6
The stuff I filmed is from 10:00
AM till about 8:00 PM.


54
0:2:6,6 --> 0:2:8,289
He's in and out of handcuffs.


55
0:2:8,289 --> 0:2:10,47
I'd never been surrounded
by that many cops.


56
0:2:10,47 --> 0:2:12,3
And then I think at about
8:00 PM, I kind of had


57
0:2:12,3 --> 0:2:14,13
enough, and I left.


58
0:2:14,13 --> 0:2:16,64
The paradox is that he's
actually kind of a mellow dude


59
0:2:16,64 --> 0:2:18,3
when he's not drunk,
when people


60
0:2:18,3 --> 0:2:19,61
aren't giving him drugs.


61
0:2:19,61 --> 0:2:21,97
I'm hoping to explore that.


62
0:2:21,97 --> 0:2:23,83
Who is Antwuan Dixon?


63
0:2:23,83 --> 0:2:24,97
What's his story?


64
0:2:24,97 --> 0:2:26,1
And this is it--


65
0:2:26,1 --> 0:2:27,22
Antwuan Dixon episode.


66
0:2:27,22 --> 0:2:28,47
Hope you enjoy it.


67
0:2:28,47 --> 0:2:35,78



68
0:2:35,78 --> 0:2:38,474
MALE SPEAKER: What are you
going to ask Jim and Erik


69
0:2:38,474 --> 0:2:39,31
about Lizard?


70
0:2:39,31 --> 0:2:39,73
Antwuan?


71
0:2:39,73 --> 0:2:40,576
MALE SPEAKER: What
about Lizard?


72
0:2:40,576 --> 0:2:42,21
I'm going to do a
Lizard episode


73
0:2:42,21 --> 0:2:44,594
and an Antwuan episode.


74
0:2:44,594 --> 0:2:47,25
How'd you first hear of him?


75
0:2:47,25 --> 0:2:49,68
ERIK ELLINGTON: First heard
of Antwuan probably five


76
0:2:49,68 --> 0:2:50,7
or six years ago.


77
0:2:50,7 --> 0:2:52,27
And Angel [INAUDIBLE]


78
0:2:52,27 --> 0:2:53,4
from [INAUDIBLE]


79
0:2:53,4 --> 0:2:54,33
showed me a tape.


80
0:2:54,33 --> 0:2:56,56
I don't know how he got it.


81
0:2:56,56 --> 0:2:58,99
But he was like, yo,
check this kid out.


82
0:2:58,99 --> 0:3:3,43
And he was like 15,
just killing it.


83
0:3:3,43 --> 0:3:5,92
ANTWUAN DIXON: How'd you get
approached to get on Baker?


84
0:3:5,92 --> 0:3:8,572



85
0:3:8,572 --> 0:3:11,81
ANTWUAN DIXON: By Erik and
Andrew at the trade show while


86
0:3:11,81 --> 0:3:15,92
I was watching Eric.


87
0:3:15,92 --> 0:3:19,45
They show him doing
Baker at Carlsbad.


88
0:3:19,45 --> 0:3:21,69
And then I seen them,
and they're like,


89
0:3:21,69 --> 0:3:22,8
wait, Antwuan Dixon?


90
0:3:22,8 --> 0:3:28,45
I'm like, yeah, like, you
know what I'm saying?


91
0:3:28,45 --> 0:3:29,2
What the fuck?


92
0:3:29,2 --> 0:3:30,33
They know me?


93
0:3:30,33 --> 0:3:33,215
That's why I was like,
yeah, like--


94
0:3:33,215 --> 0:3:34,15
[INAUDIBLE]


95
0:3:34,15 --> 0:3:35,685
so I'm like, yeah.


96
0:3:35,685 --> 0:3:39,19
And he goes and gets Andrew.


97
0:3:39,19 --> 0:3:40,8
They're like, yeah, some--


98
0:3:40,8 --> 0:3:43,19
blah, blah, blah, blah.


99
0:3:43,19 --> 0:3:44,79
So we like your fucking
[INAUDIBLE].


100
0:3:44,79 --> 0:3:46,6
We want to give you a board.


101
0:3:46,6 --> 0:3:48,555
And I was like, for real?


102
0:3:48,555 --> 0:3:50,41
Like, damn.


103
0:3:50,41 --> 0:3:52,56
ERIK ELLINGTON: Me and Andrew
asked him if he wanted to get


104
0:3:52,56 --> 0:3:54,11
boards from Baker.


105
0:3:54,11 --> 0:3:56,78
And he was like, yeah-- just
real humble, mellow kid--


106
0:3:56,78 --> 0:3:58,273
really, really mellow.


107
0:3:58,273 --> 0:4:0,472
And he's like, yeah sure.


108
0:4:0,472 --> 0:4:4,5
JIM GRECO: Filming the "Baker
3," hear about this kid that


109
0:4:4,5 --> 0:4:11,48
they put on that was just like
the most unbelievable thing.


110
0:4:11,48 --> 0:4:14,44
Then I finally seen this part
at the premiere, and I was


111
0:4:14,44 --> 0:4:15,97
like fucking blown away.


112
0:4:15,97 --> 0:4:17,66
I couldn't believe my eyes.


113
0:4:17,66 --> 0:4:20,37
ANTWUAN DIXON: You know, it's
like, my first premiere, my


114
0:4:20,37 --> 0:4:22,38
name's on the fucking TV.


115
0:4:22,38 --> 0:4:25,375
People were like not really
saying nothing.


116
0:4:25,375 --> 0:4:26,95
You know, they're like, what
the fuck was this?


117
0:4:26,95 --> 0:4:28,61
But it was so crazy.


118
0:4:28,61 --> 0:4:31,36
I was like looking, and then
they're clapping and clapping


119
0:4:31,36 --> 0:4:35,55
as it's going on, and
then after it, the


120
0:4:35,55 --> 0:4:37,196
people just went crazy.


121
0:4:37,196 --> 0:4:43,97



122
0:4:43,97 --> 0:4:47,275
Once it was over, I walked out
of there dog, I felt like--


123
0:4:47,275 --> 0:4:49,86



124
0:4:49,86 --> 0:4:53,92
it was the craziest thing--
like, the craziest


125
0:4:53,92 --> 0:4:56,97
overwhelming feeling, like--


126
0:4:56,97 --> 0:4:58,93
you know like--


127
0:4:58,93 --> 0:5:1,31
like, it was weird, but
it wasn't like--


128
0:5:1,31 --> 0:5:2,39
[BREATHING FAST]--


129
0:5:2,39 --> 0:5:2,95
not at the time.


130
0:5:2,95 --> 0:5:4,67
I was just feeling like a--


131
0:5:4,67 --> 0:5:6,6
[BREATHING SLOW]--


132
0:5:6,6 --> 0:5:8,87
like, oh my-- it was weird, like
[BREATHING FAST]-- like


133
0:5:8,87 --> 0:5:10,0
finna cry or--


134
0:5:10,0 --> 0:5:11,15
I can't even fucking
explain it.


135
0:5:11,15 --> 0:5:14,55
It was just like probably
just so fucking happy.


136
0:5:14,55 --> 0:5:16,9
Every little kid's dream--
wants to get


137
0:5:16,9 --> 0:5:17,575
on Baker, you know?


138
0:5:17,575 --> 0:5:20,74
MALE SPEAKER: After that, it was
like it was like being on


139
0:5:20,74 --> 0:5:23,78
was like a green light to just
be the best or something like


140
0:5:23,78 --> 0:5:27,6
that, because for a certain
period of time, he was getting


141
0:5:27,6 --> 0:5:29,19
like two or three tricks
a day-- like


142
0:5:29,19 --> 0:5:30,7
gnarly shit, easily.


143
0:5:30,7 --> 0:5:33,93
And it was all "Baker 3," and
then I made this "Baker Has a


144
0:5:33,93 --> 0:5:35,48
Death Wish." He has a
full-length part in


145
0:5:35,48 --> 0:5:36,48
that one, you know.


146
0:5:36,48 --> 0:5:38,24
That was all of Antwuan--


147
0:5:38,24 --> 0:5:39,35
those three videos--


148
0:5:39,35 --> 0:5:43,33
that's his career
to me so far.


149
0:5:43,33 --> 0:5:45,49
ERIK ELLINGTON: So when we
approached Antwuan-- like,


150
0:5:45,49 --> 0:5:47,4
we're starting Death Wish
as a board company.


151
0:5:47,4 --> 0:5:48,23
You want to ride for it?


152
0:5:48,23 --> 0:5:51,255
He was just automatically into
it because he'd been writing


153
0:5:51,255 --> 0:5:53,326
on his grip tape forever
and stuff like that.


154
0:5:53,326 --> 0:5:54,202
MALE SPEAKER: And he hadn't
been pro yet?


155
0:5:54,202 --> 0:5:55,8
ERIK ELLINGTON: No.


156
0:5:55,8 --> 0:5:56,17
He turned pro for Death Wish.


157
0:5:56,17 --> 0:5:57,64
There was a demand
for his board.


158
0:5:57,64 --> 0:6:5,3
And he's really a charismatic
dude, so at signings and


159
0:6:5,3 --> 0:6:9,415
stuff, he's just kind of the
center of attention.


160
0:6:9,415 --> 0:6:12,81
And it just seems like once all
that stuff comes together,


161
0:6:12,81 --> 0:6:14,765
you just go, oh, yeah,
he should be pro.


162
0:6:14,765 --> 0:6:17,57
SHANE HEYL: Just to watch him
do a three flip or a crook


163
0:6:17,57 --> 0:6:20,83
back 180, it's just like how
do you do it like that?


164
0:6:20,83 --> 0:6:22,25
And you have all these
other kids trying


165
0:6:22,25 --> 0:6:24,27
to mimic his style.


166
0:6:24,27 --> 0:6:25,185
That's just how he skates.


167
0:6:25,185 --> 0:6:26,32
He's just chilling--


168
0:6:26,32 --> 0:6:28,716
arms down, kind of relaxed--
and that's how he does it.


169
0:6:28,716 --> 0:6:31,6
And you see people faking the
funk, where it's just like


170
0:6:31,6 --> 0:6:33,45
they're trying so hard
to be like him.


171
0:6:33,45 --> 0:6:34,39
It's like, come on, man.


172
0:6:34,39 --> 0:6:36,78
You can't do that.


173
0:6:36,78 --> 0:6:39,472
MALE SPEAKER: What skaters
did you look up to?


174
0:6:39,472 --> 0:6:46,15
ANTWUAN DIXON: There was one
dude that I loved out of


175
0:6:46,15 --> 0:6:49,55
everybody, and I still do.


176
0:6:49,55 --> 0:6:50,282
MALE SPEAKER: Who's that?


177
0:6:50,282 --> 0:6:53,5
ANTWUAN DIXON: His name
is Gailea Momolu--


178
0:6:53,5 --> 0:6:54,705
best gnarly [INAUDIBLE]--


179
0:6:54,705 --> 0:6:56,42
you know what I'm saying?--


180
0:6:56,42 --> 0:6:57,74
black power--


181
0:6:57,74 --> 0:6:58,88
real quick.


182
0:6:58,88 --> 0:7:2,1
I don't know, it's just like
that's why I do [INAUDIBLE]


183
0:7:2,1 --> 0:7:2,93
and [INAUDIBLE].


184
0:7:2,93 --> 0:7:5,79
He's the man of that shit, and I
used to just love how he did


185
0:7:5,79 --> 0:7:8,7
it, so I wanted to learn
it like him.


186
0:7:8,7 --> 0:7:9,76
So that's why he's
my favorite.


187
0:7:9,76 --> 0:7:13,2
He does bomb ass [INAUDIBLE]
flips, like gnarly tail slide,


188
0:7:13,2 --> 0:7:15,86
gnarly [INAUDIBLE] lip, gnarly
[INAUDIBLE] back lip, gnarly


189
0:7:15,86 --> 0:7:17,31
[INAUDIBLE] back lip.


190
0:7:17,31 --> 0:7:19,13
He's the fucking shit.


191
0:7:19,13 --> 0:7:20,57
He's so good.


192
0:7:20,57 --> 0:7:23,57
My other favorite skaters
are Theotis Beasley.


193
0:7:23,57 --> 0:7:24,68
That's my baby.


194
0:7:24,68 --> 0:7:27,45
He's been there, you know?


195
0:7:27,45 --> 0:7:30,28
Just like how he's seen me--
just like how I've seen him,


196
0:7:30,28 --> 0:7:31,77
we came from nothing
to something,


197
0:7:31,77 --> 0:7:32,94
you know what I mean?


198
0:7:32,94 --> 0:7:34,816
Two little hood niggers--


199
0:7:34,816 --> 0:7:37,15
you know?-- fuck.


200
0:7:37,15 --> 0:7:39,3
THEOTIS BEASLEY: Yeah, I
knew him for years--


201
0:7:39,3 --> 0:7:40,89
yeah, kind of like my brother.


202
0:7:40,89 --> 0:7:44,28
We all grew up around the same
area-- me, Antwuan, and


203
0:7:44,28 --> 0:7:46,39
[INAUDIBLE], but them
