###11 DAN SANTORO: I did a gecko and I started shading outside of
###13 it because I did the line work.
###16 And then I jumped onto the shader.
###18 And I had lime green.
###19 And let's say this is the gecko.
###22 I wasn't looking and I just went like this.
###25 And just the way I was stretching, I thought this was
###27 inside the gecko.
###29 So I just started whip-shading lime green.
###32 And then I pulled my hand away and there was this giant green
###36 whip shade marks.
###37 And they guy didn't see it, though.
###38 So I was like, yo, man.
###41 You know what would look real cool?
###43 If this thing was sitting on some leaves.
###45 And he was like, yeah.
###46 I was like, I'm not going to charge you, man.
###48 He's like, yeah, I'd love some leaves.
###51 So I just put a big leaf there.
###52 
###70 BERT KRAK: Dan has a very distinct style that, usually,
###72 when you see it, you can tell it's his own.
###75 
###80 Dan's approach is just different.
###83 And it's unique.
###84 
###94 We're all special.
###95 Dan's just a little extra special, you know?
###98 He's into, obviously, tattooing, music--
###102 DAN SANTORO: The new Inquisition record.
###104 This is the shit, right here.
###105 BERT KRAK: He's into painting.
###108 And that's with brushes or aerosol.
###111 He's also into collecting and antiquing.
###114 Oh, he's extremely well-rounded.
###117 DAN SANTORO: It's confusing.
###118 It's a cultural identity issue.
###120 I'm almost overly exposed to things.
###125 I have so many friends that are into so
###127 much interesting stuff.
###128 And I've manage to find merit in almost everything.
###132 Luckily, I've really kind of cultivated what I like the
###135 most about things that I like.
###137 And I've kind of made it work.
###139 The shop I work at now is Smith Street Tattoo Parlour.
###142 
###154 STEVE BOLTZ: There's four of us working at
###155 Smith Street Tattoo.
###156 It's me, Bert Krak, Eli Quinters, and Dan Santoro.
###162 Me, Eli, and Bert opened the place sort of together, and
###164 then Dan joined us about a year later.
###166 But Dan was always in the plan.
###167 Dan was like our fourth guy.
###170 DAN SANTORO: I was at Adorned.
###171 And at the time that Smith Street was even a twinkle in
###175 any of their eyes, I was around a lot.
###178 I was spending a lot of time at Steve's.
###179 A lot of nights, get off work, hop on the train, go over to
###183 Steve's, have a couple cold boys, some painting.
###186 So around that time, Steve had mentioned something that he
###189 was walking his dog in the neighborhood and he saw this
###193 storefront that looked like it had been vacant for some time.
###196 And how he thought it was a really cool block, right by
###198 the train, and all this stuff like that.
###200 And he said he was going to look into it.
###202 I was scared to say yes at first.
###204 I didn't know Smith Street was going to be as
###207 amazing as it is.
###209 I mean, I should have known.
###210 But I didn't.
###210 And I thought about it for like a week.
###212 And then I was like, you know what?
###213 I'm just going to do it.
###214 I'm pretty impulsive and whatever.
###217 So I'm just going to do it.
###218 It's just one of those things where the planets aligned for
###222 Smith Street.
###222 We were all friends.
###224 Dream situation for me, working with these guys.
###228 BERT KRAK: This is 100% our clubhouse.
###229 
###232 I never feel, driving here from Queens, like
###235 I'm going to work.
###236 I always feel like I'm coming here to hang out with my
###238 friends and have a good time.
###241 DAN SANTORO: I think Eli's closer to Steve.
###243 And me and Bert, I think, might be a little similar.
###247 We exchanged birthday tattoos.
###248 We have the same birthday.
###249 So we actually did little Cancer crabs on each other on
###253 one of our birthdays.
###255 Bert absolutely loves the fact that we're
###257 born on the same day.
###259 He brings up about once a week.
###261 BERT KRAK: I was born July 12, '77.
###263 I believe he's July 12, '83.
###268 I'm very much a Cancer.
###270 So is he.
###271 You know, hard on the outside, soft on the inside.
###274 We're both really sensitive.
###276 It wouldn't take much to really ruffle our feathers.
###281 No, there was already graffiti, dude.
###283 DAN SANTORO: Of course, but yo-- but there's not already
###285 tags all over the fucking walls in here.
###287 All right, we're not having a fucking moral
###288 conversation right now.
###290 It's the dumbest shit ever.
###293 STEVE BOLTZ: Before Dan came on, I was kind
###295 of the loose cannon.
###296 Because I'm a little bit messy.
###298 I definitely can be a loud mouth.
###300 And, maybe in a different way, Dan's now the loose cannon.
###303 He's just a pathological thinker, you know?
###306 DAN SANTORO: I don't know.
###306 It's like when you go to Walmart and you see the old
###309 lady with the puffy, pink, patch sweatshirt.
###313 You know the feeling you get?
###315 That's how I feel sometimes when people bring certain
###317 tattoos in.
###319 I really want to give it to them.
###320 And I want to make it really good.
###322 All right.
###323 So I get a phone call.
###325 And this woman's like, we have this woman.
###327 She wants to get tattooed.
###329 I think she got--
###331 I think it was Charlie Brown, if I'm not mistaken.
###333 And she's going like, aargh.
###336 And she's shaking her leg.
###338 Within three lines, the tattoo is so fucked.
###341 So I was just like--
###343 dude.
###343 It was like being on a ride.
###344 I was just like.
###346 And I did it.
###348 ELI QUINTERS: Nothing's ever set in stone with Santoro.
###352 Dan seems to be definitely the least
###355 organized out of everybody.
###357 STEVE BOLTZ: Dan also has the same mentality, as far as
###361 that's our job and making tattoos.
###362 But Dan just does everything by the seat of his pants.
###364 And I think that the whole seat-of-the-pants or
###367 unpreparedness or whatever, I think he subconsciously is
###371 that way on purpose.
###372 
###375 The way he tattoos, there's a lot of confidence.
###377 And even very simple, clunky tattoos just look so good.
###382 ELI QUINTERS: He's one of my favorites, for sure.
###384 It's traditional, real
###386 stripped-down, real bare bones.
###389 I would say he's a little looser than maybe I am.
###392 I really try to do a very exact line and everything.
###396 And he recently moved me away from that.
###399 He's made me loosen up a lot.
###402 I think he's kind of got a lot of what Dan Higgs had in that
###405 he knows just how to put down a line and just do the tattoo.
###409 And it comes out--
###411 I don't know.
###412 It looks great.
###413 
###415 He can make something look pretty and delicate and all
###419 those things, but they still have that
###421 Santoro look to them.
###422 
###427 BERT KRAK: Me and Dan, we do a lot of really
###430 kind of bold tattooing.
###431 But it doesn't mean that Eli and Steve
###433 can't do the same thing.
###436 We're a team.
###439 DAN SANTORO: Almost every tattoo that gets done, good or
###441 bad, we show off to each other.
###443 I think that's a really good thing.
###445 I've worked in shops where I couldn't even tell you the
###449 last tattoo I saw of an artist for months.
###451 You know what I mean?
###452 You just kind of work in your little corner of the shop,
###455 finish a tattoo, put a bandage on it, see you later.
###458 There's no fun in that.
###460 I mean, I want to see it.
###461 I want to see what you're doing.
###463 I want to see if you did something that maybe I
###465 should've been thinking about.
###466 We bite the hell out of each other, but it's cool.
###468 We work together.
###471 That's why we're there.
###472 
###478 FERGUS SIMMS: These guys are just doing the best of the
###480 tattoos around, in my opinion.
###482 It's the best shop in the world by far, for the style
###486 especially.
###488 We've been planning this trip for a while
###490 from Melbourne, Australia.
###491 I don't know.
###491 We saved up for six, seven months or so, and then bought
###494 tickets and came.
###495 We haven't done too much tourist stuff yet.
###497 We've just kind of been sitting in the shop.
###499 I think we're up to 11 now, and then got a
###502 couple more on Tuesday.
###504 So this one's from Steve.
###508 And from Dan.
###510 This one's from Dan as well-- cool little cat.
###513 Got the dagger skull from Dan and little crying hema heart
###518 from Dan as well.
###519 And that one's from Steve.
###521 STEVE BOLTZ: It's just like a kind of a special thing at
###523 Smith Street because we all do anything, but we all basically
###527 do the same thing, too.
###528 And people don't necessarily ask or say, that looks like a
###530 Steve Boltz tattoo or a Bert Krak tattoo so much anymore as
###534 they might say, that looks like a Smith Street tattoo.
###535 And I hear that and I love it.
###537 If you come to the shop and I'm not there, you're not
###540 afraid to sit in Dan's chair or Eli's chair because you
###543 know that you're going to get basically the same product.
###545 
###556 We very consciously want our tattoos to look a certain way.
###559 And New York is part of that.
###561 New York's a very
###562 straightforward approach to living.
###564 There's no fucking around.
###566 And I think in tattooing, maybe there's a similar thing
###568 whereas it's a very straightforward look to
###570 tattoos as opposed to it being fancier or more artistic.
###575 Hey, we want our tattoos to look classic.
###576 We don't want them to look dated.
###578 And when somebody comes and wants an owl on their chest,
###582 it's like, why don't you just get a fucking
###584 eagle on your chest?
###585 Why do you got to get an owl?
###587 The technical application is what will make a
###589 tattoo slick, to me.
###591 It's a good thing to just be able to give somebody a nice
###595 solid, clean, predictable tattoo.
###598 That's a good thing.
###599 And even if it's a tattoo that 50 people have, its new and
###602 it's original because you have to put your hand to it.
###606 
###608 ELI QUINTERS: We're all really going for the tattoo style.
###612 We want our tattoos to look like tattoos.
###616 When you're a little kid and you think about what a tattoo
###619 is, the first thing for myself and I think a lot of people
###622 that popped into their head are the anchors like Popeye
###626 had, or even a Mom heart or something like that.
###628 Just something that would almost be represented in a
###631 cartoon, so to speak.
###633 What you picture in your head when somebody says the word
###636 "tattoo" is usually some sort of tattoo imagery, not some
###641 no-outline, color portrait thing.
###643 You know what I mean?
###644 So, I mean, I think that's probably
###646 unifying in that terms.
###648 We use a bold outline and a lot of black shading.
###652 We have a lot of the same reference material.
###654 Tattooing is an art and its form is this traditional,
###659 almost sailor-style tattooing.
###662 DAN SANTORO: I guess maybe I started tattooing late enough.
###665 There was still enough going on with people wanting to do
###671 traditional stuff that I was like, OK.
###674 I know I want my tattoos to look like that, but how?
###677 And then I was finding the Dan Higgs tattoos that were in
###681 "Tattoo Time."
###682 "Tattoo Time" was a publication that Ed Hardy put
###684 of from early '80s probably to the early '90s that had the
###688 weirdo art section.
###691 And they were just really strange tattoos, but they
###694 still had that traditional application that I was looking
###698 for in anything, really.
###701 I'd see tattoos and not really know why I liked them.
###703 But I knew I just liked them.
###705 And then I'd realize down the road, oh, it's
###707 because they're bold.
###709 And they're simple.
