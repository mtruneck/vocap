0:0:24,12 --> 0:0:30,68
We`ve been talking about some of the traditional
events involved in the presidential inauguration.


5
0:0:30,68 --> 0:0:35,26
Another one happened on Tuesday morning, the
inaugural prayer service. The president, First


6
0:0:35,26 --> 0:0:40,95
Lady Michelle Obama and about 2200 other people
went to the interfaith service at the National


7
0:0:40,95 --> 0:0:45,66
Cathedral. Now, by interfaith, we mean, it
involved different religions. Yesterday`s


8
0:0:45,66 --> 0:0:50,239
service included prayers and readings for
members of the Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox


9
0:0:50,239 --> 0:0:55,75
Christian as well as Jewish, Islamic and Sikh
faiths. The tradition of the inaugural prayer


10
0:0:55,75 --> 0:1:0,129
service started with George Washington. It`s
been held at the National Cathedral since


11
0:1:0,129 --> 0:1:0,29
1985.

AZUZ: That was part of President Obama`s inaugural
speech on Monday. He mentioned some of the


18
0:1:15,399 --> 0:1:19,92
issues that are going to be part of his second
term agenda. What he hopes to get done during


19
0:1:19,92 --> 0:1:21,63
the next four years.


20
0:1:21,63 --> 0:1:25,24
Some of the issues are holdovers from his
first term, trying to lower the country`s


21
0:1:25,24 --> 0:1:30,909
debt. Working on immigration reform. Other
issues are new for him like gun control. On

for President Obama`s second term.

0:1:35,52 --> 0:1:39,92
Antonio said "I hope to see a more stable
economy and a more united nation rather than


24
0:1:39,92 --> 0:1:43,219

AZUZ: Davos is the resort city in the Swiss
mountains. That`s not why we are talking about


35
0:2:27,5 --> 0:2:32,92
it. It`s because this week, like every year,
Davos is hosting the World Economic Forum.


36
0:2:32,92 --> 0:2:37,47
This is a group that brings together business
leaders, political leaders and other influential


37
0:2:37,47 --> 0:2:41,89
folks. They are going to be talking about
global economic issues like the debt crisis


38
0:2:41,89 --> 0:2:46,35
and high unemployment rates across parts of
Europe. Or the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling


39
0:2:46,35 --> 0:2:51,66
debates in Washington. The group also brainstorms
possible solutions, like creating a bailout


40
0:2:51,66 --> 0:2:57,9
fund or coming up with ways for governments
to reduce their debt. Richard Quest now has


41
0:2:57,9 --> 0:3:1,57
an analogy comparing some of the economic
issues that will be discussed at Davos to


42
0:3:1,57 --> 0:3:2,94
a popular pastime.

RICHARD QUEST, CNN CORRESPONDENT: On the mountain,
risk is everywhere. And the lessons ...

0:3:11,41 --> 0:3:13,5
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whoever skies, parallel
....


46
0:3:13,5 --> 0:3:20,15
QUEST: Newitt (ph) has been a ski instructor
for years. He knows that on the mountain and


47
0:3:20,15 --> 0:3:25,3
in the global economy, it`s all about balance.


48
0:3:25,3 --> 0:3:28,819
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have to move with the
bump, and take it.


49
0:3:28,819 --> 0:3:35,28
QUEST: So far, we`ve navigated the bump of
the fiscal cliff. Now, we must negotiate the


50
0:3:35,28 --> 0:3:44,1
debt ceiling, high unemployment, social unrest.
Again, we learn from the mountain - baby steps


51
0:3:44,1 --> 0:3:44,9
to build confidence.


52
0:3:44,9 --> 0:3:52,69
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But if we ski slowly, we
feel what we are doing and then we get confident


53
0:3:52,69 --> 0:3:55,64
and we get faster and faster.


54
0:3:55,64 --> 0:4:1,91
QUEST: But economic growth seemingly won`t
go faster.


55
0:4:1,91 --> 0:4:11,5
There`s always the risk in the global economy
that something goes wrong.


56
0:4:11,5 --> 0:4:18,4
Snowboarders, they have their own way of shredding
down the mountain. It`s brutal economics.


57
0:4:18,4 --> 0:4:23,15
(on camera): What`s the secret to snowboarding?


58
0:4:23,15 --> 0:4:25,15
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don`t be scared.


59
0:4:25,15 --> 0:4:28,439
QUEST: You pick speed too quickly, and you
end up falling over.


60
0:4:28,439 --> 0:4:32,15
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, come on, like, that`s
why you need to move.


61
0:4:32,15 --> 0:4:34,409
QUEST: Why do you like snowboarding?


62
0:4:34,409 --> 0:4:34,99
(LAUGHTER)


63
0:4:34,99 --> 0:4:40,759
QUEST: You go too fast, too quickly and fall
over?


64
0:4:40,759 --> 0:4:43,69
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not necessarily.


65
0:4:43,69 --> 0:4:49,169
QUEST (voice over): Perhaps, the best lesson
to be learned in managing risk comes from


66
0:4:49,169 --> 0:4:57,229
the cross-country skier. Those hardy experts
of slow, steady progress taking huge amounts


67
0:4:57,229 --> 0:4:58,33
of energy.


68
0:4:58,33 --> 0:5:5,509
As the map of the mountain shows, everything
is interconnected. And that will be on the


69
0:5:5,509 --> 0:5:12,309
minds of the participants in Davos as they
analyze today`s global risks.


70
0:5:12,309 --> 0:5:14,11

72
0:5:15,9 --> 0:5:22,21
AZUZ: All right. Thanks, Richard. Jackie Chisolm
(ph) is a teacher in Florida. She said, after


73
0:5:22,21 --> 0:5:27,74
last month shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary
School an idea came to her - she thought we


74
0:5:27,74 --> 0:5:33,55
buy back guns, why not buy back video games
and DVDs? That`s what she started doing. We


75
0:5:33,55 --> 0:5:38,159
are talking specifically about violent games
and DVDs. She offered students a chance to


76
0:5:38,159 --> 0:5:44,8
trade in their violent video games. For each
one they turn in, students get money back.


77
0:5:44,8 --> 0:5:47,58
The teacher is paying for it out of her own
money, and she believes that violence in games


78
0:5:47,58 --> 0:5:52,34
and movies can affect the actions of the people
playing or watching them. That`s why she started


79
0:5:52,34 --> 0:5:58,2
this buyback idea. As some folks will agree
with this, some folks won`t, so we are asking


80
0:5:58,2 --> 0:6:3,68
about it on our blog today at cnnstudentnews.com.
Do you think that playing violent video games


81
0:6:3,68 --> 0:6:8,699
or watching violent movies contributes to
violent behavior? Talk to us on our blog.

out to Mr. Biggs` STAR class at Hoech Middle


84
0:6:14,749 --> 0:6:20,389
School in St. Louis, Missouri. Baboons and
chimpanzees are both part of which of these


85
0:6:20,389 --> 0:6:26,77
groups? Here we go, are they both: apes, monkeys,
primates or troglodytes? You`ve got three


86
0:6:26,77 --> 0:6:27,259
seconds, go!


87
0:6:27,259 --> 0:6:40,759
Baboons are monkeys, chimps are apes, and
both are primates. That`s your answer and


88
0:6:40,759 --> 0:6:42,759
that`s your "Shoutout."

90
0:6:44,77 --> 0:6:50,5
AZUZ: The oldest and largest primate center
in the U.S. is in Atlanta, Georgia. Some researchers


91
0:6:50,5 --> 0:6:55,719
there studying things like morality, also,
reciprocity, the idea that if I give you something,


92
0:6:55,719 --> 0:6:59,219
you`ll give me something back that`s about
the same. These could be considered some high


93
0:6:59,219 --> 0:7:3,969
level concepts, but these scientists think
the monkeys and apes they work with, get it.


94
0:7:3,969 --> 0:7:4,539
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


95
0:7:4,539 --> 0:7:10,189
FRANS DE WAAL: A morality is usually considered
a uniquely humane domain, and maybe it is


96
0:7:10,189 --> 0:7:14,409
in some ways, but I think morality also has
elements of empathy and compassion, on the


97
0:7:14,409 --> 0:7:22,9
one hand, reciprocity and fairness. And all
of these elements we can see in other primates.


98
0:7:22,9 --> 0:7:27,279
We do, for example, studies on fairness. Are
they sensitive to getting less than somebody


99
0:7:27,279 --> 0:7:31,189
else, or more than somebody else? We do studies
on yawn contagion, how they are affected by


100
0:7:31,189 --> 0:7:33,559
the yawns of others, like humans are? You
know.


101
0:7:33,559 --> 0:7:37,68
Well, yawn contagion is interesting because
we know in humans it correlates with empathy.


102
0:7:37,68 --> 0:7:43,449
If you are very sensitive to the yawns of
others, you are usually also a very empathic


103
0:7:43,449 --> 0:7:49,339
person. And we study it by giving chimpanzees
a little video that they can watch, and on


104
0:7:49,339 --> 0:7:53,289
the video they see a yawning chimpanzee. And
then we see what they do, of course. And what


105
0:7:53,289 --> 0:7:57,43
we find is that if the chimpanzee that they
see on the video is one that they know, they


106
0:7:57,43 --> 0:8:2,46
are going to be yawning more. If it`s someone
that they don`t know, so a stranger, they


107
0:8:2,46 --> 0:8:3,979
are unaffected by it.


108
0:8:3,979 --> 0:8:10,169
Reciprocity, we`ve done studies of where we
give, for example, one chimpanzee a lot of


109
0:8:10,169 --> 0:8:15,889
food, and then see how that chimpanzee shares
with others, and then we do another occasion


110
0:8:15,889 --> 0:8:19,819
and see if the ones who have received from
this chimp are willing to return the favor.


111
0:8:19,819 --> 0:8:25,479
And chimpanzees do, chimpanzees do keep favors
in mind, but also negative actions, like humans,


112
0:8:25,479 --> 0:8:29,889
they also take revenge. Well, for example
if chimpanzee has lost a fight to several


113
0:8:29,889 --> 0:8:34,74
others, he may wait for an occasion to get
even with these individuals individually.


114
0:8:34,74 --> 0:8:41,27
So, reciprocity is a basic element, fairness
in dividing resources also basic element of


115
0:8:41,27 --> 0:8:46,39
human society. And if you can recognize these
elements in animals like chimpanzees who are


116
0:8:46,39 --> 0:8:50,77
also closely related to us, that means that
that characteristic is probably quite old.


117
0:8:50,77 --> 0:8:51,59
(END VIDEOTAPE)


118
0:8:51,59 --> 0:8:57,75
AZUZ: Well, as far as we know, David Parsons
isn`t angry with anyone. But he is asking


119
0:8:57,75 --> 0:9:4,12
everyone to hug it out. Everyone he can find
in a 24-hour period. Parsons is aiming for


120
0:9:4,12 --> 0:9:9,71
a world record: the most hugs by one person
in one day. His amiable affection isn`t aimless.


121
0:9:9,71 --> 0:9:15,32
He`s hoping his hugs raise money for an organization
that helps kids fighting cancer. He set up


122
0:9:15,32 --> 0:9:19,9
shot on Monday, and, of course, he didn`t
turn away anyone who got in line. When you`re


123
0:9:19,9 --> 0:9:23,28
trying for this kind of record, you can`t
afford to keep anyone in arm`s length. You


124
0:9:23,28 --> 0:9:27,35
just give yourself over to the experience,
you know, really embrace it. I think we have


125
0:9:27,35 --> 0:9:30,93
squeezed every drop of pun we can out of this
one. So we`re going to wrap things up and


126
0:9:30,93 --> 0:9:33,99

in the global economy, it`s all about balance.


174
0:9:43,7 --> 0:9:43,92
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have to move with the
bump, and take it.


175
0:9:43,92 --> 0:9:44,21
QUEST: So far, we`ve navigated the bump of
the fiscal cliff. Now, we must negotiate the


176
0:9:44,21 --> 0:9:44,46
debt ceiling, high unemployment, social unrest.
Again, we learn from the mountain - baby steps


177
0:9:44,46 --> 0:9:44,52
to build confidence.


178
0:9:44,52 --> 0:9:44,84
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But if we ski slowly, we
feel what we are doing and then we get confident


179
0:9:44,84 --> 0:9:44,95
and we get faster and faster.


180
0:9:44,95 --> 0:9:45,1
QUEST: But economic growth seemingly won`t
go faster.


181
0:9:45,1 --> 0:9:45,31
There`s always the risk in the global economy
that something goes wrong.


182
0:9:45,31 --> 0:9:45,57
Snowboarders, they have their own way of shredding
down the mountain. It`s brutal economics.


183
0:9:45,57 --> 0:9:45,69
(on camera): What`s the secret to snowboarding?


184
0:9:45,69 --> 0:9:45,78
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don`t be scared.


185
0:9:45,78 --> 0:9:46,0
QUEST: You pick speed too quickly, and you
end up falling over.


186
0:9:46,0 --> 0:9:46,22
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, come on, like, that`s
why you need to move.


187
0:9:46,22 --> 0:9:46,32
QUEST: Why do you like snowboarding?


188
0:9:46,32 --> 0:9:46,34
(LAUGHTER)


189
0:9:46,34 --> 0:9:46,52
QUEST: You go too fast, too quickly and fall
over?


190
0:9:46,52 --> 0:9:46,6
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not necessarily.


191
0:9:46,6 --> 0:9:46,87
QUEST (voice over): Perhaps, the best lesson
to be learned in managing risk comes from


192
0:9:46,87 --> 0:9:47,1
the cross-country skier. Those hardy experts
of slow, steady progress taking huge amounts


193
0:9:47,1 --> 0:9:47,14
of energy.


194
0:9:47,14 --> 0:9:47,43
As the map of the mountain shows, everything
is interconnected. And that will be on the


195
0:9:47,43 --> 0:9:47,64
minds of the participants in Davos as they
analyze today`s global risks.


196
0:9:47,64 --> 0:9:47,72
Richard Quest, CNN, Davos.


197
0:9:47,72 --> 0:9:47,75
(END VIDEOTAPE)


198
0:9:47,75 --> 0:9:48,4
AZUZ: All right. Thanks, Richard. Jackie Chisolm
(ph) is a teacher in Florida. She said, after


199
0:9:48,4 --> 0:9:48,33
last month shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary
School an idea came to her - she thought we


200
0:9:48,33 --> 0:9:48,64
buy back guns, why not buy back video games
and DVDs? That`s what she started doing. We


201
0:9:48,64 --> 0:9:48,89
are talking specifically about violent games
and DVDs. She offered students a chance to


202
0:9:48,89 --> 0:9:49,18
trade in their violent video games. For each
one they turn in, students get money back.


203
0:9:49,18 --> 0:9:49,5
The teacher is paying for it out of her own
money, and she believes that violence in games


204
0:9:49,5 --> 0:9:49,81
and movies can affect the actions of the people
playing or watching them. That`s why she started


205
0:9:49,81 --> 0:9:50,12
this buyback idea. As some folks will agree
with this, some folks won`t, so we are asking


206
0:9:50,12 --> 0:9:50,41
about it on our blog today at cnnstudentnews.com.
Do you think that playing violent video games


207
0:9:50,41 --> 0:9:50,66
or watching violent movies contributes to
violent behavior? Talk to us on our blog.


208
0:9:50,66 --> 0:9:50,71

209
0:9:50,71 --> 0:9:50,97
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mr. Biggs` STAR class at Hoech Middle


210
0:9:50,97 --> 0:9:51,24
School in St. Louis, Missouri. Baboons and
chimpanzees are both part of which of these


211
0:9:51,24 --> 0:9:51,51
groups? Here we go, are they both: apes, monkeys,
primates or troglodytes? You`ve got three


212
0:9:51,51 --> 0:9:51,55
seconds, go!


213
0:9:51,55 --> 0:9:51,8
Baboons are monkeys, chimps are apes, and
both are primates. That`s your answer and


214
0:9:51,8 --> 0:9:51,85
that`s your "Shoutout."


215
0:9:51,85 --> 0:9:51,91
(END VIDEO CLIP)


216
0:9:51,91 --> 0:9:52,2
AZUZ: The oldest and largest primate center
in the U.S. is in Atlanta, Georgia. Some researchers


217
0:9:52,2 --> 0:9:52,47
there studying things like morality, also,
reciprocity, the idea that if I give you something,


218
0:9:52,47 --> 0:9:52,74
you`ll give me something back that`s about
the same. These could be considered some high


219
0:9:52,74 --> 0:9:53,1
level concepts, but these scientists think
the monkeys and apes they work with, get it.


220
0:9:53,1 --> 0:9:53,5
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


221
0:9:53,5 --> 0:9:53,33
FRANS DE WAAL: A morality is usually considered
a uniquely humane domain, and maybe it is


222
0:9:53,33 --> 0:9:53,62
in some ways, but I think morality also has
elements of empathy and compassion, on the


223
0:9:53,62 --> 0:9:53,91
one hand, reciprocity and fairness. And all
of these elements we can see in other primates.


224
0:9:53,91 --> 0:9:54,18
We do, for example, studies on fairness. Are
they sensitive to getting less than somebody


225
0:9:54,18 --> 0:9:54,49
else, or more than somebody else? We do studies
on yawn contagion, how they are affected by


226
0:9:54,49 --> 0:9:54,65
the yawns of others, like humans are? You
know.


227
0:9:54,65 --> 0:9:54,91
Well, yawn contagion is interesting because
we know in humans it correlates with empathy.


228
0:9:54,91 --> 0:9:55,21
If you are very sensitive to the yawns of
others, you are usually also a very empathic


229
0:9:55,21 --> 0:9:55,52
person. And we study it by giving chimpanzees
a little video that they can watch, and on


230
0:9:55,52 --> 0:9:55,85
the video they see a yawning chimpanzee. And
then we see what they do, of course. And what


231
0:9:55,85 --> 0:9:56,19
we find is that if the chimpanzee that they
see on the video is one that they know, they


232
0:9:56,19 --> 0:9:56,5
are going to be yawning more. If it`s someone
that they don`t know, so a stranger, they


233
0:9:56,5 --> 0:9:56,57
are unaffected by it.


234
0:9:56,57 --> 0:9:56,84
Reciprocity, we`ve done studies of where we
give, for example, one chimpanzee a lot of


235
0:9:56,84 --> 0:9:57,13
food, and then see how that chimpanzee shares
with others, and then we do another occasion


236
0:9:57,13 --> 0:9:57,44
and see if the ones who have received from
this chimp are willing to return the favor.


237
0:9:57,44 --> 0:9:57,71
And chimpanzees do, chimpanzees do keep favors
in mind, but also negative actions, like humans,


238
0:9:57,71 --> 0:9:57,98
they also take revenge. Well, for example
if chimpanzee has lost a fight to several


239
0:9:57,98 --> 0:9:58,23
others, he may wait for an occasion to get
even with these individuals individually.


240
0:9:58,23 --> 0:9:58,48
So, reciprocity is a basic element, fairness
in dividing resources also basic element of


241
0:9:58,48 --> 0:9:58,75
human society. And if you can recognize these
elements in animals like chimpanzees who are


242
0:9:58,75 --> 0:9:59,1
also closely related to us, that means that
that characteristic is probably quite old.


243
0:9:59,1 --> 0:9:59,4
(END VIDEOTAPE)


244
0:9:59,4 --> 0:9:59,35
AZUZ: Well, as far as we know, David Parsons
isn`t angry with anyone. But he is asking


245
0:9:59,35 --> 0:9:59,66
everyone to hug it out. Everyone he can find
in a 24-hour period. Parsons is aiming for


246
0:9:59,66 --> 0:9:59,96
a world record: the most hugs by one person
in one day. His amiable affection isn`t aimless.


247
0:9:59,96 --> 0:10:0,27
He`s hoping his hugs raise money for an organization
that helps kids fighting cancer. He set up


248
0:10:0,27 --> 0:10:0,58
shot on Monday, and, of course, he didn`t
turn away anyone who got in line. When you`re


249
0:10:0,58 --> 0:10:0,87
trying for this kind of record, you can`t
afford to keep anyone in arm`s length. You


250
0:10:0,87 --> 0:10:1,16
just give yourself over to the experience,
you know, really embrace it. I think we have


251
0:10:1,16 --> 0:10:1,5
squeezed every drop of pun we can out of this
one. So we`re going to wrap things up and


252
0:10:1,5 --> 0:12:1,5
see you back again tomorrow for more CNN STUDENT
NEWS. Bye-bye.
