This is a brief update video for activities
of the venus project, for February of 2011.


2
0:0:12,519 --> 0:0:21,49
Ok that sounds great. Thanks a lot, bye bye.
He says he can't get enough, he says everytime


3
0:0:21,49 --> 0:0:25,849
you hear it you hear something new and, you
know. He put it together differently - he


4
0:0:25,849 --> 0:0:32,73
was great. He wants to come on a tour. Besides
the tours on schedualed Saturdays, Jacque


5
0:0:32,73 --> 0:0:39,93
is continuously creating and revising new
designs, in all areas of the social sequences.


6
0:0:39,93 --> 0:0:47,49
For every design and drawing that he keeps,
he probably throws out about 10. He then selects


7
0:0:47,49 --> 0:0:57,489
from the sketches, ones he wants to be rendered
into 3D annimations. Andrew and Julita are


8
0:0:57,489 --> 0:1:6,29
located in London, and they head up the venus
project design team. Just give you an idea


9
0:1:6,29 --> 0:1:15,899
of size. It looks very good Andrew. It's getting
there. We've been working with Julita and


10
0:1:15,899 --> 0:1:21,399
Andrew for about 2 years now. They take Jacques
sketches and turn it into a beautiful vision,


11
0:1:21,399 --> 0:1:26,729
of what the future can be. So if you'd like
to learn more about our design team, visit


12
0:1:26,729 --> 0:1:35,9
thevenusprojectdesign.com. On the same site
we have a tremendous professional database


13
0:1:35,9 --> 0:1:40,79
that you might want to check out and join
as well. We're also filming the hundreds of


14
0:1:40,79 --> 0:1:45,46
scale models that Jacque made with an HD camera,
because they were originally shot on high


15
0:1:45,46 --> 0:1:50,619
8 over 10 years ago. There's always a lot
working against you when you shoot outside,


16
0:1:50,619 --> 0:1:56,109
there are the bugs, the wind, the rain, the
sun, making sure the shadows are in the right


17
0:1:56,109 --> 0:2:3,429
places, and the sun is always moving. So it's
always an interesting venture. After we do


18
0:2:3,429 --> 0:2:8,319
get the models shot, then it's into the editing
room, where we go over the shots, and see


19
0:2:8,319 --> 0:2:12,99
what we're going to pick. We're doing this
for presentations, because we are always having


20
0:2:12,99 --> 0:2:18,45
meetings with people for the possibility of
doing the first city or a more extensive research


21
0:2:18,45 --> 0:2:25,6
centre. In addition, I'm presently narrating
Jacque's book, the best that money can't buy


22
0:2:25,6 --> 0:2:31,63
beyond politics, poverty, & war into an audio
book. Unfortunetly, I don't know the release


23
0:2:31,63 --> 0:2:37,67
date on that yet.


24
0:2:37,67 --> 0:2:44,42
We appreciate everyone's interest and support.
And keep watching for new content and lectures


25
0:2:44,42 --> 0:4:44,42
which we'll try to post regularly. Thanks.
