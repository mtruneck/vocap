2
0:0:24,34 --> 0:0:24,79
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: We're
in Tokyo right now.


3
0:0:24,79 --> 0:0:27,3
Everyone's well aware of the
subcultures and fetishes that


4
0:0:27,3 --> 0:0:28,49
exist here.


5
0:0:28,49 --> 0:0:30,6
That's inside the city,
happening around me right now.


6
0:0:30,6 --> 0:0:33,28
But outside the city there's
another subculture.


7
0:0:33,28 --> 0:0:35,33
It's called Dekotora.


8
0:0:35,33 --> 0:0:37,3
Basically it's Pimp My
Ride for trucks.


9
0:0:37,3 --> 0:0:39,66
And these huge Transformer-esque
type things


10
0:0:39,66 --> 0:0:42,79
with neon lights and murals
and chandeliers.


11
0:0:42,79 --> 0:0:45,58
And our mission while we're here
is to meet the guys who


12
0:0:45,58 --> 0:0:46,4
started it.


13
0:0:46,4 --> 0:0:48,45
For all these different missions
I'm going to have


14
0:0:48,45 --> 0:0:50,3
someone along with me, who I'm
going to call my co-pilot.


15
0:0:50,3 --> 0:0:51,61
And you're going to
meet her tomorrow.


16
0:0:51,61 --> 0:0:54,35
But for now, I'm going head
round Tokyo and try and soak


17
0:0:54,35 --> 0:0:55,6
this all up.


18
0:0:55,6 --> 0:1:11,24



19
0:1:11,24 --> 0:1:13,42
So I told you guys that we're
going to have a co-pilot along


20
0:1:13,42 --> 0:1:15,58
for the ride and it's
Maggie Stoody.


21
0:1:15,58 --> 0:1:16,19
Can I call you Maggie?


22
0:1:16,19 --> 0:1:16,76
MAGGIE STOODY: You can.


23
0:1:16,76 --> 0:1:17,14
Thank you.


24
0:1:17,14 --> 0:1:18,3
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: It's Mags.


25
0:1:18,3 --> 0:1:19,45
What do you want?


26
0:1:19,45 --> 0:1:21,48
MAGGIE STOODY: Oh, it all
looks so appetizing.


27
0:1:21,48 --> 0:1:22,25
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: So you want
to be crazy kickboxer


28
0:1:22,25 --> 0:1:23,72
or upset pork man.


29
0:1:23,72 --> 0:1:24,46
What do you want to be?


30
0:1:24,46 --> 0:1:28,36
MAGGIE STOODY: I think I'm going
to go crazy kickboxer.


31
0:1:28,36 --> 0:1:29,75
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: It's hot.


32
0:1:29,75 --> 0:1:32,25
It's hot, pre-warmed
pork noodles.


33
0:1:32,25 --> 0:1:40,1



34
0:1:40,1 --> 0:1:42,56
What do you do when you're not
in Tokyo or going out to


35
0:1:42,56 --> 0:1:43,59
discover Dekotora trucks?


36
0:1:43,59 --> 0:1:45,8
MAGGIE STOODY: I
am a Chicagoan.


37
0:1:45,8 --> 0:1:46,26
I travel a lot.


38
0:1:46,26 --> 0:1:48,11
Just got back from Ecuador
a couple weeks ago.


39
0:1:48,11 --> 0:1:48,27
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Sweet.


40
0:1:48,27 --> 0:1:49,12
What were you doing
in Ecuador?


41
0:1:49,12 --> 0:1:50,15
MAGGIE STOODY: Just
bumming around.


42
0:1:50,15 --> 0:1:52,71
And my brother and
I are starting a


43
0:1:52,71 --> 0:1:54,65
small sunglasses company.


44
0:1:54,65 --> 0:1:57,86
And a portion of our profits
go to eradicating vitamin A


45
0:1:57,86 --> 0:2:0,745
deficiency which is a huge world
health crisis that not


46
0:2:0,745 --> 0:2:1,88
that many people know about.


47
0:2:1,88 --> 0:2:2,56
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: OK cool.


48
0:2:2,56 --> 0:2:3,79
MAGGIE STOODY: Yeah.


49
0:2:3,79 --> 0:2:7,72
So I know we're on the mission
to find Dekotora trucks but I


50
0:2:7,72 --> 0:2:9,96
have to admit I don't really
know what they are.


51
0:2:9,96 --> 0:2:10,72
MAGGIE STOODY: Dekotora
trucks basically


52
0:2:10,72 --> 0:2:12,7
means decorated truck.


53
0:2:12,7 --> 0:2:15,86
It all starts off these guys,
just ordinary truck drivers,


54
0:2:15,86 --> 0:2:17,92
start a whole new subculture.


55
0:2:17,92 --> 0:2:20,85
In '74, there's a production
company and the guy was


56
0:2:20,85 --> 0:2:23,83
working there, saw one of these
Dekotora trucks, was


57
0:2:23,83 --> 0:2:27,2
inspired and fascinated by it
and started off this whole


58
0:2:27,2 --> 0:2:29,34
sub-genre of movies
about truck guys.


59
0:2:29,34 --> 0:2:30,75
And the first one's called
Truck Rascals.


60
0:2:30,75 --> 0:2:39,79



61
0:2:39,79 --> 0:2:43,71
They formed a group of Dekotora
truck drivers to make


62
0:2:43,71 --> 0:2:45,59
it easier for the production
company.


63
0:2:45,59 --> 0:2:48,62
It really exploded and other
groups started forming around


64
0:2:48,62 --> 0:2:50,7
the country and it became
a big thing.


65
0:2:50,7 --> 0:2:51,73
It's really dwindling.


66
0:2:51,73 --> 0:2:54,86
You don't see Dekotora trucks
in Tokyo anymore.


67
0:2:54,86 --> 0:2:56,5
We're going to bump
into the newer


68
0:2:56,5 --> 0:2:58,0
generation of Dekotora drivers.


69
0:2:58,0 --> 0:2:58,71
MAGGIE STOODY: Cool.


70
0:2:58,71 --> 0:3:0,265
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: See them with
their pimped out rides


71
0:3:0,265 --> 0:3:0,97
and just hanging.


72
0:3:0,97 --> 0:3:1,15
MAGGIE STOODY: Cool.


73
0:3:1,15 --> 0:3:1,63
I can't wait to hang.


74
0:3:1,63 --> 0:3:2,15
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH:
Just hanging with


75
0:3:2,15 --> 0:3:3,4
the big white trucks.


76
0:3:3,4 --> 0:3:7,36



77
0:3:7,36 --> 0:3:10,57
We're on our way to Gunma in
Central Japan, about two hours


78
0:3:10,57 --> 0:3:12,58
west of Tokyo.


79
0:3:12,58 --> 0:3:15,39
We're supposed to meet with one
of the old school original


80
0:3:15,39 --> 0:3:16,68
Dekotora truck drivers.


81
0:3:16,68 --> 0:3:19,18
His name is Taguchi San and he's
been in the scene for the


82
0:3:19,18 --> 0:3:20,72
last three decades.


83
0:3:20,72 --> 0:3:22,74
We're going to find out a little
bit more about the


84
0:3:22,74 --> 0:3:24,715
history of Dekotora and
how it started.


85
0:3:24,715 --> 0:3:25,965
MAGGIE STOODY: Thank
you for having us.


86
0:3:25,965 --> 0:4:38,22



87
0:4:38,22 --> 0:4:38,89
MAGGIE STOODY: Thank you.


88
0:4:38,89 --> 0:4:40,0

you so much.

90
0:4:41,25 --> 0:4:49,3



91

ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH:
We're in Gunma.


92
0:4:50,5 --> 0:4:53,24
Behind me is the Dekotora store,
and this kind of acts


93
0:4:53,24 --> 0:4:54,47
as a truck stop for guys.


94
0:4:54,47 --> 0:4:55,31
There's a diner over there.


95
0:4:55,31 --> 0:4:57,44
Or the guys stop here and they
get a tune up as well.


96
0:4:57,44 --> 0:4:59,36
But this is also where they
get all their supplies for


97
0:4:59,36 --> 0:5:1,54
Dekotora, the lights and the
neons, and the horns.


98
0:5:1,54 --> 0:5:3,62
And we're going to go inside now
and go and check it out.


99
0:5:3,62 --> 0:5:9,19



100
0:5:9,19 --> 0:5:9,68
MAGGIE STOODY: Enormous.


101
0:5:9,68 --> 0:5:11,23
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: The
bombardment on your senses


102
0:5:11,23 --> 0:5:14,18
with all the flashing lights and
everything and everything.


103
0:5:14,18 --> 0:5:15,57
MAGGIE STOODY: Whoa,
it's so big.


104
0:5:15,57 --> 0:5:17,53
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: From
decorating the outside to the


105
0:5:17,53 --> 0:5:20,9
chandeliers to the upholstery,
anything you can get for the


106
0:5:20,9 --> 0:5:23,93
truck is here in this store.


107
0:5:23,93 --> 0:5:26,75

unicorn action for ya.

these little guys.

It's an enormous key chain.


115
0:5:35,65 --> 0:5:38,28
I already know how I would
do my Dekotora.


116
0:5:38,28 --> 0:5:42,63

black finish, and then all


117
0:5:42,63 --> 0:5:44,235

121

ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: You can take
your Lil Wayne Dekotora


122
0:5:49,25 --> 0:5:50,2
and you can shove it.


123
0:5:50,2 --> 0:5:51,5
MAGGIE STOODY: I really
would too.


124
0:5:51,5 --> 0:5:53,32
Like you could go grandma's
Dekotora.

ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: This
is just crazy.

MAGGIE STOODY: So cool.


128
0:6:5,31 --> 0:6:6,45
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: The fact that
we have three lined up


129
0:6:6,45 --> 0:6:9,89
and with the sun bouncing off of
them, with all the silver.


130
0:6:9,89 --> 0:6:10,55

even start with getting

142
0:6:23,17 --> 0:6:50,6

ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: The murals
on the side, how did he pick


144
0:6:52,17 --> 0:6:54,13
this one out and who
commissioned it?


145
0:6:54,13 --> 0:6:57,538
Who painted it?


146

it himself.

150
0:7:1,1 --> 0:7:4,99



151
0:7:4,99 --> 0:7:7,42
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Is it rude
to ask him how much he spent


152
0:7:7,42 --> 0:7:8,275
all together?


153
0:7:8,275 --> 0:7:9,63
If he could estimate.


154
0:7:9,63 --> 0:7:14,4



155
0:7:14,4 --> 0:7:16,5
ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Does he have
it specifically insured


156
0:7:16,5 --> 0:7:19,0
for that amount?


157
0:7:19,0 --> 0:7:20,25

Dekotora our Mini?

now been Dekotora'd so it's time
to go in the workshop and
