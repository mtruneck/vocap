0:0:3,77 --> 0:0:9,379
Word up Food Tubers. Ok, here we are in the
mouth of a fireplace. Life doesn't get much


2
0:0:9,379 --> 0:0:14,27
more exciting than that. Now, we're making
Essex S'mores. Melting marshmallow and then


3
0:0:14,27 --> 0:0:19,7
squash it with another biscuit. From here,
dip in some chocolate.


4
0:0:19,7 --> 0:0:25,24
This recipe is in honour of our YouTube friends;
Grace, Mamrie and Hannah and they did a fantastic


5
0:0:25,24 --> 0:0:29,47
film - Camp Takota. So it's all about camp
fire cooking.


6
0:0:29,47 --> 0:0:36,0
S'mores is all about getting a stick, melting
up that marshmallow, getting it nice and soft


7
0:0:36,0 --> 0:0:42,44
and sandwiching that into a biscuit. Now in
America you guys have the Graham crackers.


8
0:0:42,44 --> 0:0:49,559
We don't have them here in the UK but what
we do have is digestive biscuits. Brilliant


9
0:0:49,559 --> 0:0:56,17
biscuit! Or you could use a rich tea biscuit.
and very simply squash it with another biscuit


10
0:0:56,17 --> 0:0:59,75
and that's the whole thing. Now you can put
other things in it. I've got some jam here,


11
0:0:59,75 --> 0:1:4,39
you can put a little bit of that in there.
I've got some beautiful salted caramel here.


12
0:1:4,39 --> 0:1:9,719
I'm gonna dip my S'mores in a little chocolate.
And by the way this is naughty. You will get


13
0:1:9,719 --> 0:1:14,859
no nutritional value out of this, but it makes
people happy so every now and again this is


14
0:1:14,859 --> 0:1:20,479
what life's all about. What I've done, if
you can find anything metal, a pan, you could


15
0:1:20,479 --> 0:1:25,84
use anything. Half fill it with water. You
could put it next to the fire and then you


16
0:1:25,84 --> 0:1:30,679
can pop another little plate or tin. And I've
got chocolate, just smashed up chocolate in


17
0:1:30,679 --> 0:1:36,569
there. You can melt pretty much any chocolate
bar. And from here you can kinda have a little


18
0:1:36,569 --> 0:1:43,409
bit of a dip session. So we can go in with
some chocolate here and then we come out,


19
0:1:43,409 --> 0:1:49,729
shake off the excess. You can just rub that
up the side like that. And then you can have


20
0:1:49,729 --> 0:1:54,179
that landing in something. You can have it
landing in coconut, desiccated coconut, you


21
0:1:54,179 --> 0:2:0,229
can toast it off beforehand if you want. But
that is gonna be bad ass! Here's my first


22
0:2:0,229 --> 0:2:7,299
attempt of an Essex S'mores. Ok, so there's
number one, let's go in with a second. I'm


23
0:2:7,299 --> 0:2:12,64
gonna keep a little bit un-chocolated in the
middle and then I'm just gonna twiddle my


24
0:2:12,64 --> 0:2:21,84
rim around the nuts. Essex S'mores number
two! Look at that, even a hole in the middle.


25
0:2:21,84 --> 0:2:27,16
Dip and a little bit of a roll up. Enjoy your
campfire cooking. If you wanna find out more

34
0:3:5,11 --> 0:3:10,66
Word up Food Tubers, Jamie Oliver here in
the mouth of an oven.
