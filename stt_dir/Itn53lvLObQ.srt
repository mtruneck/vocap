0:0:3,727 --> 0:0:6,127
<i>When you're crazy about someone</i>


2
0:0:6,127 --> 0:0:8,647
<i>even waking up isn't so bad any more,</i>


3
0:0:8,647 --> 0:0:10,967
Good morning.


4
0:0:10,967 --> 0:0:14,887
<i>The air feels crisper</i>
<i>the sun seems brighter,</i>


5
0:0:14,887 --> 0:0:18,7
<i>Even your morning breath smells good,</i>


6
0:0:18,7 --> 0:0:21,887
- You taste like old eggs.
- l'm so sorry.


7
0:0:21,887 --> 0:0:27,967
l love old eggs.


8
0:0:27,967 --> 0:0:32,367
You are so different
from the guys l usually go out with.


9
0:0:32,367 --> 0:0:36,247
- How so?
- For starters,


10
0:0:36,247 --> 0:0:38,207
l'm still wearing pants.


11
0:0:38,207 --> 0:0:41,87
That is because l respect you.


12
0:0:41,87 --> 0:0:42,567
Yeah?


13
0:0:42,567 --> 0:0:45,687
And also, this triple knot,
l couldn't get out.


14
0:0:45,687 --> 0:0:48,287
Thanks for being so patient with me.


15
0:0:48,287 --> 0:0:50,727
l hope you don't think l'm a big tease.


16
0:0:50,727 --> 0:0:54,367
l just love sleeping
in the same bed with you.


17
0:0:54,367 --> 0:1:1,807
l've never slept better.


18
0:1:1,807 --> 0:1:4,7
Me neither.


19
0:1:4,7 --> 0:1:7,207
l'll go ahead and say it.
l hope we never have sex.


20
0:1:7,207 --> 0:1:17,767
What would you say if l told you
that l feel ready right now?


21
0:1:17,767 --> 0:1:21,87
- Whatever.
- Then l think tonight...


22
0:1:21,87 --> 0:1:23,607
Tonight is good,
but now also good.


23
0:1:23,607 --> 0:1:30,487
Now works. Sure.


24
0:1:30,487 --> 0:1:33,367
Now, that's what l'm talking about.


25
0:1:33,367 --> 0:1:52,847
- Get out!
- 7.1 5, ya'll. Gotta go to work.


26
0:1:52,847 --> 0:1:55,647
<i>Since Alex is a social worker</i>
<i>she's here a lot,</i>


27
0:1:55,647 --> 0:1:59,287
<i>For some guys that would be</i>
<i>distracting but I'm staying focused,</i>


28
0:1:59,287 --> 0:2:1,767
You're on my foot.


29
0:2:1,767 --> 0:2:5,287
l'm so sorry.


30
0:2:5,287 --> 0:2:8,727
Please step on my foot.
l'm just waiting for an excuse.


31
0:2:8,727 --> 0:2:15,527
- Not today.
- Really? Why not?


32
0:2:15,527 --> 0:2:20,407
l get it. Nice pull.
You slept with her yet?


33
0:2:20,407 --> 0:2:24,247
What? l am not discussing that with you.


34
0:2:24,247 --> 0:2:26,567
- That's a no.
- Listen, Jolly Green.


35
0:2:26,567 --> 0:2:29,367
People's personal lives are just that,
personal.


36
0:2:29,367 --> 0:2:32,807
That's a definite no.


37
0:2:32,807 --> 0:2:36,367
Good to see you again, Mr Barnes.
We'll be with you in a moment.


38
0:2:36,367 --> 0:2:39,287
Put him in bed six.


39
0:2:39,287 --> 0:2:43,87
Laverne, are you
in fact part golden retriever?


40
0:2:43,87 --> 0:2:44,687
Keep it holy now.


41
0:2:44,687 --> 0:2:49,287
Because every time l toss this guy,
you bring him right back to me.


42
0:2:49,287 --> 0:2:51,487
All right, Will & Grace. Breakdown.


43
0:2:51,487 --> 0:2:54,327
With his elevated lipase,
l'd say pancreatitis.


44
0:2:54,327 --> 0:2:56,247
Grace, you wanna finish?


45
0:2:56,247 --> 0:2:59,87
- Start with a Demerol drip...
- The throbbing's back.


46
0:2:59,87 --> 0:3:2,287
Admitted for substance abuse
three times in the past year.


47
0:3:2,287 --> 0:3:5,687
- But he said he quit.
- The addict said he quit?


48
0:3:5,687 --> 0:3:7,727
Why wouldn't you tell me that?


49
0:3:7,727 --> 0:3:10,807
- That changes everything.
- l believe in Mr Barnes.


50
0:3:10,807 --> 0:3:13,807
Just because you have
a new girlfriend doesn't mean


51
0:3:13,807 --> 0:3:16,967
that the world has suddenly
turned into a giant green M&M.


52
0:3:16,967 --> 0:3:19,167
The Red Sox still suck, they do.


53
0:3:19,167 --> 0:3:23,367
Barbie here still can't decide
what to do with those annoying bangs,


54
0:3:23,367 --> 0:3:26,887
and addicts everywhere
will still lie to get a fix.


55
0:3:26,887 --> 0:3:31,487
Now, you've got to wake up, sweetheart.
You're gonna be late for school...


56
0:3:31,487 --> 0:3:33,727
You wet the bed.


57
0:3:33,727 --> 0:3:38,887
Why can't l have a normal child
without these problems?


58
0:3:38,887 --> 0:3:41,927
My mom says they frame my face.


59
0:3:41,927 --> 0:3:45,7
They don't.


60
0:3:45,7 --> 0:3:48,447
Wait, please wait, wait


61
0:3:48,447 --> 0:3:49,767
Go, bus.


62
0:3:49,767 --> 0:4:1,47
Go. Go.


63
0:4:1,47 --> 0:4:5,647
She didn't see you, Bob.
Just stay perfectly still.


64
0:4:5,647 --> 0:4:12,207
Dr Kelso!


65
0:4:12,207 --> 0:4:23,847
- Can l get a ride to the hospital?
- Of course, dear. Glad to do it.


66
0:4:23,847 --> 0:4:31,247
Dr Cox and l have been friends for
a long time. You should get to know him.


67
0:4:31,247 --> 0:4:35,927
- Do l have to?
- Yeah, you have to.


68
0:4:35,927 --> 0:4:37,967
ln case you were wondering,


69
0:4:37,967 --> 0:4:44,967
it says, ''if you can read this,
you're standing too close''.


70
0:4:44,967 --> 0:4:47,167
l wasn't trying to look.


71
0:4:47,167 --> 0:4:54,207
Let's see if you can tinkle
when someone's staring at you.


72
0:4:54,207 --> 0:4:58,167
Go ahead and take your time.
l have all day.


73
0:4:58,167 --> 0:4:59,567
Come on.


74
0:4:59,567 --> 0:5:2,927
l've been Mr Barnes' caseworker
for a long time.


75
0:5:2,927 --> 0:5:5,527
He just needs
everyone to cut him some slack.


76
0:5:5,527 --> 0:5:8,327
Here, let me get this door for you.


77
0:5:8,327 --> 0:5:12,167
l mean,
people just don't understand addiction.


78
0:5:12,167 --> 0:5:16,927
Why are we in the on-call room?


79
0:5:16,927 --> 0:5:20,687
Have you ever fooled around in here?


80
0:5:20,687 --> 0:5:23,247
Lots of times.


81
0:5:23,247 --> 0:5:26,647
- Never with anyone, but...
- Would you like to change that?


82
0:5:26,647 --> 0:5:37,247
Yes, please.


83
0:5:37,247 --> 0:5:40,127
Elliot.


84
0:5:40,127 --> 0:5:42,967
Can you come back in two minutes?


85
0:5:42,967 --> 0:5:44,647
Or 80 minutes?


86
0:5:44,647 --> 0:5:48,327
The nurses did a check.
There's 50 Percocet missing.


87
0:5:48,327 --> 0:5:51,567
We should split up into teams
and search every room.


88
0:5:51,567 --> 0:5:53,967
We'll take this one.


89
0:5:53,967 --> 0:5:56,447
Fine.


90
0:5:56,447 --> 0:6:1,327
They're gonna go right to Mr Barnes.
l'm gonna check on him.


91
0:6:1,327 --> 0:6:4,567
- Alex?
- What?


92
0:6:4,567 --> 0:6:10,527
- l don't like it when you leave.
- Come here.


93
0:6:10,527 --> 0:6:17,7
Tonight we'll pick up
right where we left off.


94
0:6:17,7 --> 0:6:21,167
20 bucks says it never happens.


95
0:6:21,167 --> 0:6:24,607
What, you're offended?


96
0:6:24,607 --> 0:6:27,727
- Bob, how are you?
- Fine, Allan.


97
0:6:27,727 --> 0:6:32,887
Today, l think l'll try a double
half-caf multi-foam latte mochaccino


98
0:6:32,887 --> 0:6:35,847
with a shot of vanilla
and a sprinkle of nutmeg.


99
0:6:35,847 --> 0:6:40,647
- Black coffee?
- Bingo-bango.


100
0:6:40,647 --> 0:6:43,567
These people actually like you.


101
0:6:43,567 --> 0:6:45,647
Maybe you should just order.


102
0:6:45,647 --> 0:6:49,607
l'll have an espresso, please, and...


103
0:6:49,607 --> 0:6:54,207
What kind of scones do you have?


104
0:6:54,207 --> 0:6:58,47
Do you mind, lady? l am in a rush.


105
0:6:58,47 --> 0:7:0,407
My goodness, l'm so sorry.


106
0:7:0,407 --> 0:7:4,607
What am l doing, thinking l can take an
extra six seconds to pick my breakfast?


107
0:7:4,607 --> 0:7:7,687
l have to call my mom, tell her
she did a lousy job raising me.


108
0:7:7,687 --> 0:7:9,767
Thank you so much.


109
0:7:9,767 --> 0:7:17,527
l think what she means is,
she doesn't give a crappuccino.


110
0:7:17,527 --> 0:7:25,567
This is on me.
God help me, l love spunk.


111
0:7:25,567 --> 0:7:29,127
How you doing?


112
0:7:29,127 --> 0:7:31,847
How are you?
Can l buy you a beer?


113
0:7:31,847 --> 0:7:36,487
This is a men's room. There's absolutely
no talking in here. Ever.


114
0:7:36,487 --> 0:7:39,687
lt's just so freaky.
We're on the same pee schedule.


115
0:7:39,687 --> 0:8:5,167
No, we're not.


116
0:8:5,167 --> 0:8:6,447
<i>This is not good,</i>


117
0:8:6,447 --> 0:8:10,207
Why assume Mr Barnes stole it?
There's lots of people on that ward.


118
0:8:10,207 --> 0:8:11,727
Good point.


119
0:8:11,727 --> 0:8:14,647
Three of them are in comas,
two can't walk, one's a nun.


120
0:8:14,647 --> 0:8:16,327
Also a valid point.


121
0:8:16,327 --> 0:8:20,487
Elliot, l'm sure Mr Barnes
didn't take the drugs.


122
0:8:20,487 --> 0:8:23,487
He has been in rehab
for over six months.


123
0:8:23,487 --> 0:8:25,807
There's no reason to be so judgmental.


124
0:8:25,807 --> 0:8:30,247
l am not judgmental. lf l were,
l'd tell you your shoes are ugly.


125
0:8:30,247 --> 0:8:33,367
Do not stoop to her level.


126
0:8:33,367 --> 0:8:36,47
Your bangs make you
look like a chipmunk.


127
0:8:36,47 --> 0:8:38,727
lt's a frame! Why can nobody see that?


128
0:8:38,727 --> 0:8:41,407
Can we get back to the matter at hand?


129
0:8:41,407 --> 0:8:43,887
Fine. So who do you think's right?


130
0:8:43,887 --> 0:8:44,807
Yeah.


131
0:8:44,807 --> 0:8:49,567
<i>Crap,</i>


132
0:8:49,567 --> 0:8:54,327
For the love of Oprah,
why would you come to Paediatrics?


133
0:8:54,327 --> 0:8:59,647
l can't go unless you're around.
You're my little pee buddy!


134
0:8:59,647 --> 0:9:1,727
What do you say we cut to the chase?


135
0:9:1,727 --> 0:9:5,967
You're dating Carla, the one person
in this hospital l can remotely stand


136
0:9:5,967 --> 0:9:10,407
and she wants us to get all kissy-faced
with each other. l get it. l do.


137
0:9:10,407 --> 0:9:13,287
But every single time
l shake my magic eight ball


138
0:9:13,287 --> 0:9:15,687
and ask it
''Are we gonna be best friends?''


139
0:9:15,687 --> 0:9:17,527
- Do you know what it says?
- No.


140
0:9:17,527 --> 0:9:19,807
Outlook is buh-leak.


141
0:9:19,807 --> 0:9:22,167
Dr Cox, you really can't
trust those things.


142
0:9:22,167 --> 0:9:26,167
When l was 9, l asked mine if l should
open it and drink the fluid inside.


143
0:9:26,167 --> 0:9:28,727
l puked blue for three days.


144
0:9:28,727 --> 0:9:32,87
Just a real cute story.
Here's what you're gonna do.


145
0:9:32,87 --> 0:9:35,687
Go back to Carla.
Don't obsess about why she's with you.


146
0:9:35,687 --> 0:9:39,727
Just tell her we went to a ballgame
and we borrowed each other's sweaters.


147
0:9:39,727 --> 0:9:45,167
- N-kay, little buddy?
- What a...


148
0:9:45,167 --> 0:9:47,567
l don't think we should stand for it.


149
0:9:47,567 --> 0:9:51,287
Dr Kelso can't just decide we're not
allowed to switch shifts any more.


150
0:9:51,287 --> 0:9:54,7
l was supposed to see
my nephew tonight in <i>Pippin,</i>


151
0:9:54,7 --> 0:9:57,327
- Who's he playing?
- Pippin.


152
0:9:57,327 --> 0:10:0,127
Bob Kelso is a bad man.


153
0:10:0,127 --> 0:10:4,887
l don't know. We never think about
how hard it is to always be the bad guy.


154
0:10:4,887 --> 0:10:7,607
l want him to die.


155
0:10:7,607 --> 0:10:10,247
- Hello, sweetness.
- Ladies.


156
0:10:10,247 --> 0:10:14,447
Carla, l was thinking about what
you said about your mother's birthday.


157
0:10:14,447 --> 0:10:19,367
l don't want her spending it alone,
so l've arranged for you to swap shifts.


158
0:10:19,367 --> 0:10:22,207
- Dr Kelso...
- Don't mention it.


159
0:10:22,207 --> 0:10:25,327
Should l pick you up tomorrow
at the same place?


160
0:10:25,327 --> 0:10:34,927
Great.
Goodbye, all you smiling faces.


161
0:10:34,927 --> 0:10:38,807
- Who'd you side with? Elliot or Alex?
- Neither. l pretended l was paged.


162
0:10:38,807 --> 0:10:42,287
When they said they didn't hear it,
l called them liars and ran.


163
0:10:42,287 --> 0:10:45,487
- They both have a point.
- Stick to the booty principle.


164
0:10:45,487 --> 0:10:48,287
- What's that?
- Who do you want to sleep with?


165
0:10:48,287 --> 0:10:53,287
- Alex.
- Then she might be right.


166
0:10:53,287 --> 0:10:57,127
<i>I'm not sure about Turk's advice,</i>
<i>Sometimes he oversimplifies things,</i>


167
0:10:57,127 --> 0:10:59,647
<i>Especially when it comes to booty,</i>


168
0:10:59,647 --> 0:11:4,607
What would you say if l told you
l feel ready right now?


169
0:11:4,607 --> 0:11:8,167
l agree with Alex.
l've been thinking about it a lot.


170
0:11:8,167 --> 0:11:12,807
l think she's right about Mr Barnes.
We can't just jump to conclusions.


171
0:11:12,807 --> 0:11:15,247
l am so surprised.


172
0:11:15,247 --> 0:11:17,767
Tell me something.


173
0:11:17,767 --> 0:11:20,647
- What do you think about Alex?
- No way!


174
0:11:20,647 --> 0:11:23,847
l'm saying nothing about a girl
you're sleeping with.


175
0:11:23,847 --> 0:11:26,687
He's not sleeping with her.


176
0:11:26,687 --> 0:11:29,687
No ramifications, nothing.
Tell me what you...


177
0:11:29,687 --> 0:11:32,847
l don't like or trust her.
l'm afraid she's gonna hurt you.


178
0:11:32,847 --> 0:11:35,927
- You're jealous.
- Shut up.


179
0:11:35,927 --> 0:11:38,607
Shut up because you're so jealous of her


180
0:11:38,607 --> 0:11:40,847
that you don't even care
that l'm happy.


181
0:11:40,847 --> 0:11:43,847
Do you honestly believe
that's what's going on here?


182
0:11:43,847 --> 0:11:49,167
<i>Do not under any circumstances</i>
<i>say what you're thinking,</i>


183
0:11:49,167 --> 0:11:57,527
l'm sorry,
but you had your chance with me.


184
0:11:57,527 --> 0:12:7,727
<i>Why don't I ever listen to me?</i>


185
0:12:7,727 --> 0:12:9,967
<i>Don't worry about yesterday,</i>


186
0:12:9,967 --> 0:12:14,47
<i>Elliot's not the type</i>
<i>that holds a grudge,</i>


187
0:12:14,47 --> 0:12:17,327
<i>Then again,,,</i>


188
0:12:17,327 --> 0:12:22,607
You should tell your neighbour you will
hang your hammock wherever you please,


189
0:12:22,607 --> 0:12:25,87
and if she doesn't like it,
she can move.


190
0:12:25,87 --> 0:12:27,87
That's what l like about you, Carla.


191
0:12:27,87 --> 0:12:30,447
You don't give a rat's ass
what anybody thinks.


192
0:12:30,447 --> 0:12:35,847
- Morning, Dr Kelso.
- Nurses.


193
0:12:35,847 --> 0:12:39,607
Get up!


194
0:12:39,607 --> 0:12:42,527
l want to apologise
for not showing up last night.


195
0:12:42,527 --> 0:12:45,847
l got home and totally passed out.


196
0:12:45,847 --> 0:12:54,7
l wasn't even sure
we had a definite plan, so...


197
0:12:54,7 --> 0:13:2,327
l'm sorry l couldn't make it.


198
0:13:2,327 --> 0:13:7,527
She seemed sorry. l am too.


199
0:13:7,527 --> 0:13:10,127
Someone called for a surgical consult?


200
0:13:10,127 --> 0:13:12,207
You're Dr Turk?


201
0:13:12,207 --> 0:13:14,487
Of course you are. Note to self.


202
0:13:14,487 --> 0:13:18,287
You've got to start writing down
the names of people that annoy you.


203
0:13:18,287 --> 0:13:21,87
Yeah. What's up?


204
0:13:21,87 --> 0:13:24,967
Two-vessel disease.
He hasn't been on medical management...


205
0:13:24,967 --> 0:13:27,847
<i>When an attending calls</i>
<i>a lowly intern for a consult</i>


206
0:13:27,847 --> 0:13:31,647
<i>it's an unwritten law the intern</i>
<i>should agree with whatever he says,</i>


207
0:13:31,647 --> 0:13:33,767
Don't you agree?


208
0:13:33,767 --> 0:13:38,607
Actually, sir,
l recommend bypass surgery.


209
0:13:38,607 --> 0:13:40,887
That's my pager.


210
0:13:40,887 --> 0:13:42,687
You're wrong.


211
0:13:42,687 --> 0:13:44,767
He's so wrong.


212
0:13:44,767 --> 0:13:49,327
You make me so angry, l...


213
0:13:49,327 --> 0:13:53,927
l have to pee.


214
0:13:53,927 --> 0:13:55,447
Me, too.


215
0:13:55,447 --> 0:13:58,647
<i>Look at her,</i>
<i>She's not even gonna say hi to me,</i>


216
0:13:58,647 --> 0:14:2,87
<i>Fine I won't say hi to her, Ever,</i>


217
0:14:2,87 --> 0:14:5,7
<i>I can't believe how stubborn she is,</i>


218
0:14:5,7 --> 0:14:7,967
<i>I am the wrong man to play chicken with,</i>


219
0:14:7,967 --> 0:14:13,407
<i>She'll blink,,, any second now,</i>


220
0:14:13,407 --> 0:14:14,927
She is so stubborn.


221
0:14:14,927 --> 0:14:17,207
Laverne, could you hand me some gauze?


222
0:14:17,207 --> 0:14:21,887
Maybe Dr Kelso can pick you up
and take you to the gauze store.


223
0:14:21,887 --> 0:14:23,847
- All right now, listen.
- Carla.


224
0:14:23,847 --> 0:14:29,47
This paperwork has your signature on it
and it is totally sub-par.


225
0:14:29,47 --> 0:14:35,727
l won't stand
for this kind of shoddy work.


226
0:14:35,727 --> 0:14:43,7
Let me help you.


227
0:14:43,7 --> 0:14:47,7
You went and got an intern to agree
with you so the guy doesn't get surgery?


228
0:14:47,7 --> 0:14:51,7
- You caught me.
- A bypass is the right call.


229
0:14:51,7 --> 0:14:52,567
Considering the risks...


230
0:14:52,567 --> 0:14:54,967
He's a diabetic
with two-vessel disease...


231
0:14:54,967 --> 0:14:57,767
Antianginals
could be equally effective.


232
0:14:57,767 --> 0:15:0,167
- Either treatment could work?
- Sure.


233
0:15:0,167 --> 0:15:3,87
So what are we arguing about?


234
0:15:3,87 --> 0:15:5,127
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, sweetie.


235
0:15:5,127 --> 0:15:9,687
<i>It was just then they realised</i>
<i>what was really going on,</i>


236
0:15:9,687 --> 0:15:13,647
<i>Dr Cox was in love</i>
<i>with Turk's girlfriend,</i>


237
0:15:13,647 --> 0:15:20,967
- Either of you want a sandwich?
- l'm all set.


238
0:15:20,967 --> 0:15:24,327
So, every tox screening came back
negative on Mr Barnes.


239
0:15:24,327 --> 0:15:27,167
- He didn't take anything.
- So?


240
0:15:27,167 --> 0:15:29,127
So, you were wrong.


241
0:15:29,127 --> 0:15:32,887
lt's not about that any more, is it?


242
0:15:32,887 --> 0:15:36,287
<i>When you can't make things right</i>
<i>with one of your best friends</i>


243
0:15:36,287 --> 0:15:38,367
<i>nothing can make you feel better,</i>


244
0:15:38,367 --> 0:15:43,887
l'm finally off.
Do you wanna get outta here?


245
0:15:43,887 --> 0:15:44,967
Hello?


246
0:15:44,967 --> 0:15:49,447
So, are we doing this or what?


247
0:15:49,447 --> 0:15:50,807
Dr Kelso.


248
0:15:50,807 --> 0:15:54,567
- Yes, what is it?
- l wanted to thank you.


249
0:15:54,567 --> 0:15:56,727
For what you did.


250
0:15:56,727 --> 0:15:59,687
When you yelled at me
in front of the other nurses.


251
0:15:59,687 --> 0:16:2,7
- l appreciate it.
- Young lady,


252
0:16:2,7 --> 0:16:4,447
l yelled at you because that paperwork


253
0:16:4,447 --> 0:16:7,847
looked like it had been done
by a drunk four-year-old.


254
0:16:7,847 --> 0:16:11,7
Listen, Carla,
l have a family who loves me,


255
0:16:11,7 --> 0:16:15,487
a handful of close friends and
a wonderful hobby shop in my basement.


256
0:16:15,487 --> 0:16:19,367
l don't spend much time worrying
about people's feelings around here.


257
0:16:19,367 --> 0:16:23,7
l just do whatever makes me happy.


258
0:16:23,7 --> 0:16:26,887
So...
can l still get a ride tomorrow?


259
0:16:26,887 --> 0:16:32,527
l don't know
if l've forgiven you yet for hiding.


260
0:16:32,527 --> 0:16:35,927
But you could always skip
the bus tomorrow morning


261
0:16:35,927 --> 0:16:42,807
and take your chances.


262
0:16:42,807 --> 0:16:46,167
We're both men.
One of us more than the other.


263
0:16:46,167 --> 0:16:48,487
- But that's OK.
- What do you want?


264
0:16:48,487 --> 0:16:51,487
l'm not gonna do anything
to mess up you and Carla.


265
0:16:51,487 --> 0:16:54,767
l won't tell her how you feel.
lt's not my place.


266
0:16:54,767 --> 0:16:57,767
But the minute you screw this thing up,


267
0:16:57,767 --> 0:17:2,7
and you will screw it up,
l'll be waiting.


268
0:17:2,7 --> 0:17:5,167
lf you're gonna wait,
l'd bring a book,


269
0:17:5,167 --> 0:17:7,367
cos it's gonna be a while.


270
0:17:7,367 --> 0:17:16,847
- You going in?
- l'm right behind you.


271
0:17:16,847 --> 0:17:21,167
Remember when the new <i>Star Wars</i>
movie came out and it was built up,


272
0:17:21,167 --> 0:17:23,527
but it really wasn't that great in bed?


273
0:17:23,527 --> 0:17:26,7
Relax. The first one's a freebie,


274
0:17:26,7 --> 0:17:30,207
so you can get your form back.


275
0:17:30,207 --> 0:17:41,607
l'm gonna change.


276
0:17:41,607 --> 0:17:50,167
l already brushed eight times but l'm
gonna take some mints out of your purse.


277
0:17:50,167 --> 0:17:52,767
See, all l did was lose the pants,


278
0:17:52,767 --> 0:17:56,767
but l think it gives me
a completely different look.


279
0:17:56,767 --> 0:18:0,687
- These are Percocet.
- JD.


280
0:18:0,687 --> 0:18:3,847
You never came over last night
cos you passed out.


281
0:18:3,847 --> 0:18:9,127
Yep, l should go.


282
0:18:9,127 --> 0:18:12,607
<i>The speech sounds the same</i>
<i>no matter whose mouth it comes out of,</i>


283
0:18:12,607 --> 0:18:15,207
<i>Even someone you thought</i>
<i>you could really like,</i>


284
0:18:15,207 --> 0:18:17,287
You don't understand, OK?


285
0:18:17,287 --> 0:18:20,247
My job comes with a lot of stress.


286
0:18:20,247 --> 0:18:25,687
lt's not like l have a serious problem.


287
0:18:25,687 --> 0:18:29,927
<i>We ended up talking</i>
<i>for a while after that,</i>


288
0:18:29,927 --> 0:18:36,207
<i>I gave her some names</i>
<i>of people that could help her,</i>


289
0:18:36,207 --> 0:18:42,87
<i>But she never got back to me,</i>


290
0:18:42,87 --> 0:18:46,7
<i>After that things got back to normal,</i>


291
0:18:46,7 --> 0:18:49,167
- You owe me 20 bucks.
- No, but l never even made...


292
0:18:49,167 --> 0:19:27,927
20 bucks.


293
0:19:27,927 --> 0:19:35,367
All right, l should've done this
a long time ago, so here goes.


294
0:19:35,367 --> 0:19:38,527
l'm sorry. l shouldn't have
accused you of being jealous.


295
0:19:38,527 --> 0:19:42,367
You were just looking out for me.
You were right about Alex.


296
0:19:42,367 --> 0:19:44,687
You never did sleep with her, did you?


297
0:19:44,687 --> 0:19:52,807
Nah. But why does that matter?


298
0:19:52,807 --> 0:20:2,727
Because l was jealous.


299
0:20:2,727 --> 0:20:30,167
Are you sure?


300
0:20:30,167 --> 0:20:32,567
What are you thinking about?


301
0:20:32,567 --> 0:22:32,567
This.
