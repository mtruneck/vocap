###23 There's No Tomorrow
###47 This is the earth,
###49 as it looked 90 million years ago.
###51 Geologists call this period the 'Late Cretaceous'.
###55 It was a time of extreme global warming,
###58 When dinosaurs still ruled the planet.
###61 They went about their lives,
###62 secure in their place at the top of the food chain,
###67 oblivious of the changes taking place around them.
###71 The continents were drifting apart,
###72 opening huge rifts in the Earth's crust.
###75 They flooded, becoming seas.
###80 Algae thrived in the extreme heat,
###82 poisoning the water.
###85 They died,
###86 and fell, in their trillions, to the bottom of the rifts.
###92 Rivers washed sediment into the seas,
###94 until the organic remains of the algae were buried.
###98 As the pressure grew, so did the heat,
###101 until a chemical reaction transformed the organics
###103 into hydrocarbon fossil fuels:
###106 Oil and Natural Gas.
###109 A similar process occurred on land,
###111 which produced coal.
###115 It took nature about 5 million years
###117 to create the fossil fuels that the world consumes in 1 year.
###122 The modern way of life
###123 is dependent on this fossilised sunlight,
###126 although a surprising number of people take it for granted.
###133 Since 1860, geologists have discovered over 2 trillion barrels of oil.
###138 Since then, the world has used approximately half.
###146 Before you can pump oil, you have to discover it.
###150 At first it was easy to find, and cheap to extract.
###153 The first great American oilfield was Spindletop,
###156 discovered in 1900
###159 Many more followed.
###161 Geologists scoured America.
###163 They found enormous deposits of oil, natural gas and coal.
###168 America produced more oil than any other country,
###171 enabling it to become an industrial super-power.
###176 Once an oil well starts producing oil,
###177 it's only a matter of time before it enters a decline.
###182 Individual wells have different production rates.
###185 When many wells are averaged together,
###187 the combined graph looks like a bell curve.
###189 Typically
###191 it takes 40 years after the peak of discovery
###194 for a country to reach its peak of production,
###197 after which it enters a permanent fall.
###200 In the 1950s,
###202 Shell geophysicist M. King Hubbert
###205 predicted that America's oil production would peak in 1970,
###208 40 years after the peak of U.S. oil discovery.
###213 Few believed him.
###215 However, in 1970,
###217 American oil production peaked,
###219 and entered a permanent decline.
###222 Hubbert was vindicated.
###225 From this point on,
###226 America would depend increasingly on imported oil.
###230 This made her vulnerable to supply disruptions,
###233 and contributed to the economic mayhem of the 1973
###237 and 1979 oil shocks.
###241 The 1930s saw the highest rate of oil discoveries in U.S. history.
###246 In spite of advanced technology,
###247 the decline in the discovery of new American oilfields has been relentless.
###254 More recent finds, such as ANWAR,
###257 would at best provide enough oil for 17 months.
###262 Even the new "Jack 2" field in the gulf of Mexico
###265 would only supply a few months of domestic demand.
###269 Though large, neither field comes close to satisfying
###271 America's energy requirements.
###276 Evidence is now mounting
###277 that world oil production is peaking, or is close to it.
###281 Globally, the rate of discovery of new oilfields peaked in the 1960s.
###286 Over 40 years later,
###287 the decline in the discovery of new fields
###290 seems unstoppable.
###294 54 of the 65 major oil producing nations
###296 have already peaked in production.
###301 Many of the others are expected to follow in the near future.
###306 The world will need to bring the equivalent
###307 of a new Saudi Arabia into production
###310 every three years
###310 to make up for declining output in existing oilfields.
###315 In the nineteen sixties,
###316 six barrels of oil were found for every one that was used.
###321 Four decades later,
###322 the world consumes between three and six barrels of oil
###325 for every one that it finds.
###329 Once the peak of world oil production is reached,
###331 demand for oil will outstrip supply,
###333 and the price of gasoline will fluctuate wildly,
###336 affecting far more than the cost of filling a car.
###341 Modern cities are fossil fuel dependent.
###344 Even roads are made from asphalt,
###346 a petroleum product,
###347 as are the roofs of many homes.
###351 Large areas would be uninhabitable
###353 without heating in the winter or air conditioning in the summer.
###358 Suburban sprawl encourages people to drive many miles
###360 to work, school and stores.
###364 Major cities have been zoned with residential
###366 and commercial areas placed far apart,
###368 forcing people to drive.
###371 Suburbia, and many communities
###372 were designed on the assumption of plentiful oil and energy.
###379 Chemicals derived from fossil fuels,
###381 or Petro-chemicals,
###383 are essential in the manufacture of countless products.
###388 The modern system of agriculture
###390 is heavily dependent on fossil fuels,
###392 as are hospitals,
###393 aviation,
###394 water distribution systems,
###397 and the U.S. military,
###398 which alone uses about 140 million barrels of oil a year.
###404 Fossil fuels are also essential for the creation of plastics and polymers,
###408 key ingredients in computers, entertainment devices and clothing.
###414 The global economy currently depends on endless growth,
###416 demanding an increasing supply of cheap energy.
###421 We are so dependant on oil and other fossil fuels,
###424 that even a small disruption in supply
###427 may have far-reaching effects on every aspect of our lives.
###437 ENERGY
###442 Energy is the ability to do work.
###446 The average American today has available the energy equivalent of 150 slaves, working 24 hours a day.
###456 Materials that store this energy for work are called fuels,
###459 Some fuels contain more energy than others.
###462 This is called energy density.
###466 Of these fuels, oil is the most critical.
###470 The world consumes 30 billion barrels a year,
###471 equal to 1 cubic mile of oil,
###474 which contains as much energy
###476 as would be generated from 52 nuclear power plants
###478 working for the next 50 years.
###483 Although oil only generates 1.6% of U.S. electricity,
###487 it powers 96% of all transportation.
###492 In 2008, two thirds of America's oil was imported.
###496 Most was from Canada,
###497 Mexico,
###499 Saudi Arabia,
###501 Venezuela,
###502 Nigeria, Iraq and Angola.
###507 Several factors make oil unique:
###509 it is energy dense.
###513 One barrel of oil contains the energy equivalent
###514 of almost three years of human labour.
###518 It is liquid at room temperature,
###519 easy to transport
###521 and usable in small engines.
###525 To acquire energy, you have to use energy.
###529 The trick is to use smaller amounts to find and extract larger amounts.
###533 This is called EROEI:
###535 Energy Return on Energy Invested.
###541 Conventional oil is a good example.
###544 The easy to extract, high-quality crude was pumped first.
###548 Oilmen spent the energy equivalent of 1 barrel of oil to find and extract 100.
###555 The EROEI of oil was 100.
###559 As the easy to find oil was pumped first,
###561 exploration moved into deep waters,
###563 or distant countries,
###565 using increasing amounts of energy to do so.
###569 Often, the oil we find now is heavy or sour crude,
###572 and is expensive to refine.
###575 The EROEI for oil today is as low as 10.
###580 If you use more energy to get the fuel than is contained in the fuel,
###583 it's not worth the effort to get it.
###590 It is possible to convert one fuel source into another.
###593 Every time you do so,
###594 some of the energy contained in the original fuel is lost.
###599 For instance, there is unconventional oil:
###600 Tar Sands and Shale.
###604 Tar Sands are found mainly in Canada.
###607 Two thirds of the world's shale is in the US.
###611 Both of these fuels can be converted to synthetic crude oil.
###613 However, this requires large amounts of heat and fresh water,
###617 reducing their EROEI,
###618 which varies from five, to as low as one and a half.
###624 Shale is an exceptionally poor fuel,
###626 pound for pound containing about one third the energy
###629 of a box of breakfast cereal.
###633 Coal exists in vast quantities,
###634 and generates almost half of the planet's electricity.
###639 The world uses almost 2 cubic miles of coal a year.
###641 However, Global coal production may peak before 2040.
###648 The claim that America has centuries worth of coal is deceptive,
###650 as it fails to account for growing demand, and decreasing quality.
###656 Much of the high quality anthracite coal is gone,
###658 leaving lower quality coal that is less energy dense.
###664 Production issues arise, as surface coal is depleted,
###666 and miners have to dig deeper and in less accessible areas.
###671 Many use destructive mountaintop removal to reach coal deposits,
###674 causing environmental mayhem.
###680 Natural gas is often found alongside oil and coal.
###684 North American discovery of conventional gas peaked in the 1950s,
###687 and production peaked in the early 70s.
###691 If the discovery graph is moved forward by 23 years,
###694 the possible future of North American conventional natural gas production
###698 is revealed.
###701 Recent breakthroughs have allowed the extraction of unconventional natural gas,
###704 such as shale gas, which might help offset decline in the years ahead.
###711 Unconventional natural gas is controversial,
###714 as it needs high energy prices to be profitable.
###718 Even with Unconventional gas,
###719 there may be a peak in global natural gas production by 2030.
###727 Large uranium reserves for nuclear fission still exist.
###732 To replace the 10 terawatts the world currently generates from fossil fuels,
###735 would require 10,000 nuclear power plants.
###739 At that rate, the known reserves of uranium would last for only 10 to 20 years.
###745 Experiments with plutonium based fast-breeder reactors
###749 in France and Japan
###751 have been expensive failures.
###753 Nuclear fusion faces massive technical obstacles.
###759 Then there are the renewables.
###760 Windpower has a high EROEI, but is intermittent.
###765 Hydro power is reliable,
###767 but most rivers in the developed world are already dammed.
###772 Conventional geothermal power plants
###774 use existing hotspots near the Earth's surface.
###777 They are limited to those areas.
###781 In the experimental EGS system,
###782 two shafts would be drilled 6 miles deep.
###786 Water is pumped down one shaft, to be heated in fissures,
###789 then rise up the other, generating power.
###793 According to a recent MIT report,
###795 this technology might supply 10% of US electricity by 2050.
###802 Wave power is restricted to coastal areas.
###805 The energy density of waves varies from region to region.
###811 Transporting wave-generated electricity inland would be challenging.
###815 Also, the salty ocean environment is corrosive to turbines.
###821 Biofuels are fuels that are grown.
###823 Wood has a low energy density, and grows slowly.
###826 The world uses 3.7 cubic miles of wood a year.
###831 Biodiesel and ethanol
###832 are made from crops grown by petroleum powered agriculture.
###837 The energy profit from these fuels is very low.
###842 Some politicians want to turn corn into ethanol.
###845 Using Ethanol to supply one tenth of projected US oil use in 2020,
###850 would require 3% of America's Land.
###855 To supply one third would require 3 times the area now used to grow food.
###860 To supply all US petroleum consumption in 2020
###863 would take twice as much land as is used to grow food.
###868 Hydrogen has to be extracted from Natural Gas, coal or water,
###873 which uses more energy than we get from the Hydrogen.
###876 This makes a Hydrogen economy unlikely.
###882 All the world's photovoltaic solar panels generate as much electricity
###885 as two coal power plants.
###888 The equivalent of between 1 and 4 tons of coal
###891 are used in the manufacture of a single solar panel.
###896 We'd have to cover as many as 140,000 square miles with panels
###900 to meet current world demand.
###902 As of 2007, there are only about 4 square miles.
###908 Concentrated Solar Power, or Solar Thermal has great potential,
###912 though at the moment there are only a small number of plants operating.
###917 They are also limited to sunny climates,
###919 requiring large amounts of electricity
###921 to be transmitted over long distances.
###926 All of the alternatives to oil depend on oil-powered machinery,
###929 or require materials such as plastics that are produced from oil.
###936 When considering future claims of amazing new fuels or inventions,
###938 ask:
###940 Does the advocate have a working, commercial model of the invention?
###945 What is its energy density?
###947 Can it be stored or easily distributed?
###951 Is it reliable or intermittent?
###953 Can it be scaled to a national level?
###956 Are there hidden engineering challenges?
###959 What is the EROEI?
###962 What are the environmental impacts?
###964 Remember that large numbers can be deceptive.
###968 For example: 1 billion barrels of oil
###969 will satisfy global demand for only 12 days.
###975 A transition from fossil fuels would be a monumental challenge.
###979 As of 2007, coal generates 48.5% of U.S. electricity.
###984 21.6% is from natural gas,
###987 1.6% is from petroleum,
###990 19.4% is from nuclear,
###992 5.8% is from hydro.
###995 Other renewables only generate 2.5%.
###1000 Is it possible to replace a system based on fossil fuels
###1003 with a patchwork of alternatives?
###1006 Major technological advances are needed,
###1008 as well as political will and co-operation,
###1011 massive investment,
###1013 international consensus,
###1016 the retrofitting of the $45 trillion global economy,
###1019 including transportation,
###1022 manufacturing industries,
###1023 and agricultural systems,
###1025 as well as officials competent to manage the transition.
###1030 If all these are achieved,
###1031 could the current way of life continue?
###1039 Growth
###1041 These bacteria live in a bottle.
###1044 Their population doubles every minute.
###1047 At 11AM there is one bacterium.
###1050 At 12 noon the bottle is full.
###1053 It is half-full at 11.59
###1055 leaving only enough space for one more doubling.
###1058 The bacteria see the danger.
###1061 They search for new bottles, and find 3.
###1064 They assume that their problem is solved.
###1067 By 12 noon, the first bottle is full.
###1070 By 12.01, the second bottle is full.
###1074 By 12.02, all the bottles are full.
###1077 This is the problem that we face,
###1079 due to the doubling caused by Exponential Growth.
###1086 When humanity began to use coal and oil as fuel sources,
###1089 it experienced unprecedented growth.
###1094 Even low growth rates produce large increases over time.
###1098 At a 1% growth rate,
###1100 an economy will double in 70 years.
###1103 A 2% rate doubles in 35 years.
###1107 At a 10% growth rate,
###1109 an economy will double in only 7 years.
###1113 If an economy grows at the current average of 3%,
###1116 it doubles every 23 years.
###1120 With each doubling, demand for energy and resources
###1124 will exceed all the previous doublings combined.
###1128 The financial system is built on the assumption of growth
###1132 - which requires an increasing supply of energy to support it.
###1136 Banks lend money they don't have,
###1138 in effect creating it.
###1141 The borrowers use the newly created loan money to grow their businesses,
###1144 and pay back the debt,
###1146 with an interest payment which requires more growth.
###1150 Due to this creation of debt formed money,
###1153 most of the world's money represents a debt with interest to be paid.
###1159 Without continual new and ever larger generations
###1162 of borrowers to produce growth,
###1164 and thus pay off these debts,
###1165 the world economy will collapse.
###1170 Like a Ponzi Scheme,
###1171 the system must expand or die.
###1175 Partly through this debt system,
###1177 the effects of economic growth have been spectacular:
###1180 in GDP,
###1181 damming of rivers,
###1183 water use,
###1184 fertiliser consumption,
###1186 urban population,
###1187 paper consumption,
###1189 motor vehicles,
###1191 communications
###1192 and tourism.
###1195 World population has grown to 7 billion,
###1197 and is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050.
###1202 On a flat, infinite earth, this would not be a problem.
###1206 However, as the Earth is round and finite,
###1208 we will eventually face limits to growth.
###1213 Economic expansion
###1214 has resulted in increases in atmospheric nitrous oxide
###1218 and methane,
###1219 ozone depletion,
###1220 increases in great floods,
###1222 damage to ocean ecosystems,
###1225 including nitrogen runoff,
###1227 loss of rainforest and woodland,
###1230 increases in domesticated land,
###1233 and species exinctions.
###1238 If we place a single grain of rice
###1240 on the first square of a chessboard,
###1242 double this and place 2 grains on the second,
###1246 double again and place 4 on the third,
###1249 double again and place 8 on the fourth,
###1251 and continue this way,
###1252 putting on each square twice the number of grains
###1255 than were on the previous one,
###1257 by the time we reach the final square,
###1259 we need an astronomical number of grains:
###1263 9 quintillion,
###1265 223 quadrillion,
###1267 372 trillion,
###1269 36 billion,
###1271 854 million,
###1273 776 thousand grains:
###1277 more grain than the human race
###1278 has grown in the last 10,000 years.
###1282 Modern economies,
###1283 like the grains on the chess board,
###1285 doubles every few decades.
###1287 On which square of the chessboard are we?
###1293 Besides energy,
###1294 civilisation demands numerous essential resources:
###1297 fresh water,
###1299 topsoil,
###1300 food,
###1301 forests,
###1302 and many kinds of minerals and metals.
###1305 Growth is limited
###1306 by the essential resource in scarcest supply.
###1311 A barrel is made of staves,
###1312 and like water filling a barrel,
###1314 growth can go no further than the lowest stave,
###1317 or the most limited essential resource.
###1322 Humans currently utilise
###1323 40% of all photosynthesis n Earth.
###1328 Though it might be possible to use 80%,
###1329 we are unlikely to ever use 160%.
###1343 FOOD
###1347 The global food supply
###1348 relies heavily on fossil fuels.
###1352 Before WW1,
###1353 all agriculture was Organic.
###1356 Following the invention of fossil fuel derived fertilisers and pesticides
###1359 there were massive improvements in food production,
###1362 allowing for increases in human population.
###1368 The use of artificial fertilisers
###1369 has fed far more people than would have been possible
###1371 with organic agriculture alone.
###1376 Fossil fuels are needed for farming equipment,
###1378 transportation,
###1379 refrigeration,
###1381 packaging - in plastic,
###1382 and cooking.
###1385 Modern agriculture uses land to turn fossil fuels into food
###1388 - and food into people.
###1392 About 7 calories of fossil-fuel energy
###1393 are used to produce 1 calorie of food.
###1399 In America, food travels approximately 1,500 miles from farm to customer.
###1410 Besides fossil fuel decline,
###1411 there are several threats to the current system of food production:
###1415 Cheap energy,
###1416 improved technology
###1417 and subsidies have allowed massive fish catches.
###1423 Global fish catches peaked in the late nineteen eighties,
###1425 forcing fishermen to move into deep waters.
###1433 Nitrogen run off by fossil fuel based fertilisers
###1435 poisons rivers and seas, creating enormous dead zones.
###1440 At this rate,
###1441 all fish populations are projected to collapse
###1443 by 2048.
###1447 Acid rain from cities and industries leeches the soil of vital nutrients,
###1451 such as potassium,
###1452 calcium,
###1453 and magnesium.
###1458 Another threat is a lack of water.
###1460 Many farms use water pumped from underground aquifers for irrigation.
###1466 The aquifers need thousands of years to fill up,
###1468 but can be pumped dry in a few decades,
###1470 like oil wells.
###1474 America's massive Ogallala aquifer has fallen so low
###1476 that many farmers have had to return to less productive dry-land farming.
###1482 Additionally, The use of irrigation and fertilisers can lead to salinisation:
###1487 the accumulation of salt in the soil.
###1489 This is a major cause of desertification.
###1493 Still another threat is topsoil loss.
###1496 200 years ago,
###1497 there were 6 feet of topsoil on the American prairies.
###1501 Today, through tillage and poor practices,
###1503 approximately half is gone.
###1508 Irrigation encourages the growth of stem rust fungi like UG-99
###1513 - which has the potential to destroy 80% of the world's grain harvest.
###1519 According to Norman Borlaug,
###1520 father of the Green Revolution,
###1522 stem rust "has immense potential for social and human destruction."
###1529 The use of biofuels means that less land
###1532 will be available for food production.
###1537 An area has a finite carrying capacity.
###1540 This is the number of animals or people
###1541 that can live there indefinitely.
###1544 If a species overshoots the carrying capacity of that area,
###1547 it will die back until the population returns to its natural limits.
###1553 The world has avoided this die-off
###1554 by finding new lands to cultivate,
###1556 or by increasing production,
###1557 which has been possible largely thanks to oil.
###1561 To continue growth,
###1563 more resources are required than the Earth can provide,
###1567 but no new planets are available.
###1571 In the face of all these challenges,
###1573 global food production must double by 2050
###1576 to feed the growing world population.
###1581 1 billion people are already malnourished or starving.
###1584 There will be challenges in feeding over 9 billion in the years to come,
###1588 when world oil and natural gas production will be in decline.
###1601 HAPPY ENDING
###1605 The global economy grows exponentially,
###1608 at about 3% a year,
###1610 consuming increasing amounts of non-renewable fuels,
###1613 minerals and metals,
###1614 as well as renewable resources
###1616 like water, forests, soils and fish
###1620 faster than they can be replenished.
###1623 Even at a growth rate of 1%,
###1625 an economy will double in 70 years.
###1630 The problem is intensified by other factors:
###1633 Globalisation allows people on one continent
###1635 to buy goods and food made by those on another.
###1639 The lines of supply are long,
###1640 placing strains on a limited oil resource.
###1646 We now rely on distant countries for basic necessities.
###1650 Modern cities are fossil fuel dependent.
###1654 Most Banking Systems are based on debt,
###1656 forcing people into a spiral of loans and repayments
###1660 - producing growth.
###1663 What can be done in the face of these problems?
###1667 Many believe that the crisis can be prevented
###1668 through conservation,
###1670 technology,
###1671 smart growth,
###1672 recycling,
###1673 electric cars and hybrids,
###1675 substitution,
###1677 or voting.
###1680 Conservation will save you money,
###1681 but it alone won't save the planet.
###1685 If some people cut back on oil use,
###1687 the reduced demand will drive down the price,
###1689 allowing others to buy it for less.
###1693 In the same fashion,
###1693 a more efficient engine that uses less energy will,
###1697 paradoxically, lead to greater energy use.
###1701 In the 19th century,
###1702 English economist William Stanley Jevons
###1705 realised that Better steam engines made coal
###1708 a more cost effective fuel source,
###1711 which led to the use of more steam engines,
###1712 which increased total coal consumption.
###1717 Growth of use will consume any energy or resources
###1720 saved through conservation.
###1728 Many believe that scientists
###1728 will solve these problems with new technology.
###1732 However, technology is not energy.
###1736 Technology can channel energy into work,
###1737 but it can't replace it.
###1740 It also consumes resources:
###1742 for instance;
###1743 computers are made with one tenth
###1744 of the energy needed to make a car.
###1748 More advanced technologies
###1750 may make the situation worse,
###1752 as many require rare minerals,
###1754 which are also approaching limits.
###1757 For example,
###1757 97% of the world's Rare Earths are produced by China,
###1761 most from a single mine in inner Mongolia.
###1766 These minerals are used in catalytic converters,
###1768 aircraft engines,
###1770 high efficiency magnets and hard drives,
###1773 hybrid car batteries,
###1775 lasers,
###1776 portable X-Rays,
###1777 shielding for nuclear reactors,
###1779 compact discs,
###1781 hybrid vehicle motors,
###1783 low energy light-bulbs,
###1785 fibre optics
###1786 and flat-screen displays.
###1789 China has begun to consider restricting the export of these minerals,
###1792 as demand soars.
###1797 So called sustainable growth or smart growth won't help,
###1800 as it also uses non renewable metals and minerals
###1803 in ever increasing quantities,
###1805 including Rare Earths.
###1808 Recycling will not solve the problem,
###1810 as it requires energy,
###1811 and the process is not 100% efficient.
###1816 It is only possible to reclaim a fraction of the material being recycled;
###1819 a large portion is lost forever as waste.
###1825 Electric cars run on electricity.
###1828 As most power is generated from fossil fuels,
###1830 this is not a solution.
###1833 Also, cars of all types consume oil in their production.
###1837 Each tire alone requires about 7 gallons of Petroleum.
###1843 There are around 800 million cars in the world, as of 2010.
###1847 At current growth rates,
###1849 this number would reach 2 billion by 2025.
###1853 It is unlikely that the planet can support this many vehicles for long,
###1857 regardless of their power source.
###1861 Many economists believe
###1862 that the free market will substitute one energy source
###1865 with another through technological innovation.
###1868 However, the main substitutes to oil
###1870 face their own decline rates.
###1873 Substitution also fails to account for the time needed to prepare for a transition.
###1880 The U.S. Department of Energy's Hirsch report
###1881 estimates that at least 2 decades would be needed to prepare
###1885 for the effects of Peak Oil.
###1888 The issues of energy shortages,
###1891 resource depletion,
###1893 topsoil loss,
###1894 and pollution are all symptoms of a single, larger problem:
###1900 Growth.
###1903 As long as our financial system demands endless growth,
###1906 reform is unlikely to succeed.
###1909 What then, will the future look like?
###1914 Optimists believe that growth will continue forever,
###1916 without limits.
###1919 Pessimists think that we're heading towards a new Stone Age,
###1922 or extinction.
###1925 The truth may lie between these extremes.
###1927 It is possible that society might fall back to a simpler state,
###1932 one in which energy use is a lot less.
###1936 This would mean a harder life for most.
###1938 More manual labour,
###1938 more farm work,
###1940 and local production of goods, food and services.
###1945 What should a person do to prepare for such a possible future?
###1949 Expect a decrease in supplies of food and goods from far away places.
###1954 Start walking or cycling.
###1956 Get used to using less electricity.
###1960 Get out of debt.
###1961 Try to avoid banks.
###1963 Instead of shopping at big box stores,
###1965 support local businesses.
###1968 Buy food grown locally, at Farmers' Markets.
###1971 Instead of a lawn, consider gardening to grow your own food.
###1975 Learn how to preserve it.
###1978 Consider the use of local currencies
###1980 should the larger economy cease to function,
###1982 and develop greater self sufficiency.
###1987 None of these steps will prevent Collapse,
###1988 but they might improve your chances in a low energy future,
###1993 one in which we will have to be more self reliant,
###1995 as our ancestors once were.
