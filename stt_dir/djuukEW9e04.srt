1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:9,54



2
0:0:9,54 --> 0:0:11,7
MALE SPEAKER 1: One second,
just keep going.


3
0:0:11,7 --> 0:0:13,6
PATRICK O'DELL: Hey, were going
to Autumn's Skate Shop


4
0:0:13,6 --> 0:0:14,74
to meet with Tim O'Connor.


5
0:0:14,74 --> 0:0:17,84
And I brought a sharpie
and a Thrasher.


6
0:0:17,84 --> 0:0:21,85
And we're going to watch him
wreck people because that's


7
0:0:21,85 --> 0:0:22,87
what he's good at.


8
0:0:22,87 --> 0:0:23,48
TIM O'CONNOR: All right.


9
0:0:23,48 --> 0:0:25,71
PATRICK O'DELL: What
about that?


10
0:0:25,71 --> 0:0:27,63
TIM O'CONNOR: Oh my god, right
off the fucking bat here.


11
0:0:27,63 --> 0:0:30,4
Wait, what's up with
cursing and stuff?


12
0:0:30,4 --> 0:0:31,23
It doesn't matter.


13
0:0:31,23 --> 0:0:31,665
It's the internet.


14
0:0:31,665 --> 0:0:32,97
PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah,
we can bleep it out.


15
0:0:32,97 --> 0:0:34,26
TIM O'CONNOR: OK, jumping
Jehoshaphats.


16
0:0:34,26 --> 0:0:40,86
First of all, never ever combine
extreme sports, OK?


17
0:0:40,86 --> 0:0:42,8
Never make a hybrid
of the two.


18
0:0:42,8 --> 0:0:44,35
This is his ad.


19
0:0:44,35 --> 0:0:45,41
PATRICK O'DELL: You think
he landed that?


20
0:0:45,41 --> 0:0:50,35
TIM O'CONNOR: He might
have landed this.


21
0:0:50,35 --> 0:0:51,13
There's nothing to say.


22
0:0:51,13 --> 0:0:51,57
I like this.


23
0:0:51,57 --> 0:0:52,83
It's what I like to see.


24
0:0:52,83 --> 0:0:56,44
He's been spared, except he
is going to get an Afro.


25
0:0:56,44 --> 0:0:59,16
I once looked at a magazine that
somebody did back in the


26
0:0:59,16 --> 0:1:2,62
day when I was at skate camp,
and every single human being


27
0:1:2,62 --> 0:1:5,3
in the magazine they
drew an Afro on.


28
0:1:5,3 --> 0:1:7,59
Let me do a Neck Face drawing
because that guy seems to be


29
0:1:7,59 --> 0:1:8,76
everywhere.


30
0:1:8,76 --> 0:1:10,66
Hey what does this
stuff look like?


31
0:1:10,66 --> 0:1:12,16
What is going on right here?


32
0:1:12,16 --> 0:1:13,1
One ad.


33
0:1:13,1 --> 0:1:15,27
He got on a team and
he was just like, I


34
0:1:15,27 --> 0:1:16,49
got one add in me.


35
0:1:16,49 --> 0:1:17,5
And this is it.


36
0:1:17,5 --> 0:1:20,79
He does it and he dies.


37
0:1:20,79 --> 0:1:23,16
It doesn't even have the name
of the kid on this ad.


38
0:1:23,16 --> 0:1:26,55
But maybe it's like introducing
a kid, but they're


39
0:1:26,55 --> 0:1:29,1
also outroducing him because
he died right after he did


40
0:1:29,1 --> 0:1:32,79
this first trick for
his Hawk clothing.


41
0:1:32,79 --> 0:1:35,75
[BIRD NOISE]


42
0:1:35,75 --> 0:1:37,81
You guys have no qualms of
me making fun of people.


43
0:1:37,81 --> 0:1:40,31
Oh my god.


44
0:1:40,31 --> 0:1:41,99
Oh my god.


45
0:1:41,99 --> 0:1:45,81
Is it a joke, or is it like I
dare you to do that trick with


46
0:1:45,81 --> 0:1:47,25
these pants on?


47
0:1:47,25 --> 0:1:50,19
Or is it purposeful?


48
0:1:50,19 --> 0:1:52,55
That's the question.


49
0:1:52,55 --> 0:1:54,3
This is, you know how you have
those old photos of yourself


50
0:1:54,3 --> 0:1:56,52
when you're a younger kid and
you're like embarrassed like,


51
0:1:56,52 --> 0:1:57,28
oh God, what was I wearing?


52
0:1:57,28 --> 0:1:58,9
And like, ew, you know?


53
0:1:58,9 --> 0:2:0,795
I wonder if they're going to
look back at these photos and


54
0:2:0,795 --> 0:2:2,64
just be all embarrassed.


55
0:2:2,64 --> 0:2:3,72
I feel bad.


56
0:2:3,72 --> 0:2:6,6
This is mean.


57
0:2:6,6 --> 0:2:7,89
I'm going to be the guy
that gets fucked up.


58
0:2:7,89 --> 0:2:8,97
I'm going to get beat up.


59
0:2:8,97 --> 0:2:9,389
Hold up.


60
0:2:9,389 --> 0:2:11,19
[FART SOUND]


61
0:2:11,19 --> 0:2:12,353
Did you get that?


62
0:2:12,353 --> 0:2:14,92
Because that hurt.


63
0:2:14,92 --> 0:2:17,31
I wasn't there, but a
photographer that was on a


64
0:2:17,31 --> 0:2:19,79
trip with these guys
told me-- this was


65
0:2:19,79 --> 0:2:23,4
an exact quote verbatim--


66
0:2:23,4 --> 0:2:26,36
one of the guys at the demo, one
of his team riders said,


67
0:2:26,36 --> 0:2:30,22
"Permission to rip, sir." And
Jamie Thomas, right back at


68
0:2:30,22 --> 0:2:32,485
him, said "Permission granted,
soldier." And then they just


69
0:2:32,485 --> 0:2:37,42
went in and landed everything
and won the demo.


70
0:2:37,42 --> 0:2:38,22
I need that thing.


71
0:2:38,22 --> 0:2:39,47
I need that thing to
hide my voice.


72
0:2:39,47 --> 0:2:41,93



73
0:2:41,93 --> 0:2:43,58
Yes, you are good.


74
0:2:43,58 --> 0:2:45,69
But apparently not
at dressing.


75
0:2:45,69 --> 0:2:48,62
And I put a little PS, a post
script in there, because he's


76
0:2:48,62 --> 0:2:49,85
holding a gun.


77
0:2:49,85 --> 0:2:51,98
A gat, if you will.


78
0:2:51,98 --> 0:2:57,3
And I said PS, please don't
shoot me with that gun there.


79
0:2:57,3 --> 0:3:0,62
I don't want to get shot.


80
0:3:0,62 --> 0:3:2,6
Unless it will up
my board sales.


81
0:3:2,6 --> 0:3:4,16
Like fucking 50 Cent
or something.


82
0:3:4,16 --> 0:3:5,67
What's happening right here?


83
0:3:5,67 --> 0:3:9,21



84
0:3:9,21 --> 0:3:13,51
Is God looking at him at this
moment or something?


85
0:3:13,51 --> 0:3:17,65
Look at the magical ray of light
that's shining upon him.


86
0:3:17,65 --> 0:3:20,88
And yes, he is putting a
record into that thing.


87
0:3:20,88 --> 0:3:21,5
Is that real?


88
0:3:21,5 --> 0:3:22,963
Do they really make those?


89
0:3:22,963 --> 0:3:25,3
PATRICK O'DELL: I
don't think so.


90
0:3:25,3 --> 0:3:27,17
I think it's a Photoshop.


91
0:3:27,17 --> 0:3:29,826
Or you think they really
make one of those?


92
0:3:29,826 --> 0:3:30,75
TIM O'CONNOR: Maybe.


93
0:3:30,75 --> 0:3:32,525
I mean, it looks huge
and outrageous.


94
0:3:32,525 --> 0:3:35,7
PATRICK O'DELL: Well if they
make one, [INAUDIBLE]


95
0:3:35,7 --> 0:3:36,33
would have it.


96
0:3:36,33 --> 0:3:37,55
TIM O'CONNOR: Yeah, it's true.


97
0:3:37,55 --> 0:3:38,8
This is true.


98
0:3:38,8 --> 0:5:38,8
