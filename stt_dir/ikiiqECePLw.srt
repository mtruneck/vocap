1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,488



2
0:0:0,488 --> 0:0:9,272
[MUSIC PLAYING]


3
0:0:9,272 --> 0:0:13,664
-Going a little higher today
than in practice.


4
0:0:13,664 --> 0:0:16,459
Yeah.


5
0:0:16,459 --> 0:0:18,64
Oh, [INAUDIBLE].


6
0:0:18,64 --> 0:0:21,74
DANNY KASS: If you go to the
US Open and you've been


7
0:0:21,74 --> 0:0:23,89
practicing a run for three
months, and you've landed it


8
0:0:23,89 --> 0:0:25,1
for two months straight.


9
0:0:25,1 --> 0:0:25,83
Well then, you know what?


10
0:0:25,83 --> 0:0:27,8
You're running it good enough.


11
0:0:27,8 --> 0:0:29,66
Because it's got to be something
that you come up


12
0:0:29,66 --> 0:0:31,37
with that's just there.


13
0:0:31,37 --> 0:0:34,13
You got to feed off the crowd of
the energy to really do it.


14
0:0:34,13 --> 0:0:34,705
And I did it.


15
0:0:34,705 --> 0:0:37,68
I did my first ever frontside
1080, after a


16
0:0:37,68 --> 0:0:41,3
cab 1080 in the 2002.


17
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:43,38
And it was a time where I think
a lot of people thought


18
0:0:43,38 --> 0:0:44,53
that the sport really
wasn't going to


19
0:0:44,53 --> 0:0:45,62
progress much further.


20
0:0:45,62 --> 0:0:49,4
And when they saw this young kid
from Jersey just kind of


21
0:0:49,4 --> 0:0:52,65
pushing and pushing, I think a
lot of people really realized


22
0:0:52,65 --> 0:0:58,22
that it was time to shit
or get off the pot.


23
0:0:58,22 --> 0:0:59,504
-This is Danny Kass
[INAUDIBLE].


24
0:0:59,504 --> 0:1:3,456



25
0:1:3,456 --> 0:1:6,715
Cab 1080.


26
0:1:6,715 --> 0:1:8,735
Yeah!


27
0:1:8,735 --> 0:1:13,3
JAKE BURTON: I think Danny Kass,
he just epitomizes what


28
0:1:13,3 --> 0:1:16,16
the Open's about, which
is amplitude,


29
0:1:16,16 --> 0:1:18,72
technical tricks, and style.


30
0:1:18,72 --> 0:1:20,825
TOM MONTEROSSO: Take any pro
snowboarder that's alive


31
0:1:20,825 --> 0:1:22,79
today, any big name
pro snowboarder.


32
0:1:22,79 --> 0:1:26,77
Chances are at some point they
either went to the US Open or


33
0:1:26,77 --> 0:1:28,72
competed in the US Open.


34
0:1:28,72 --> 0:1:32,15
I remember in the early 2000s
when Danny Kass went on his


35
0:1:32,15 --> 0:1:33,695
crazy winning streak.


36
0:1:33,695 --> 0:1:36,13
Once he won the US Open, which
is one of the last contests of


37
0:1:36,13 --> 0:1:39,12
the year, that's when it was
like, holy shit, Danny Kass is


38
0:1:39,12 --> 0:1:40,75
hands down the best pipe
rider in the world.


39
0:1:40,75 --> 0:1:43,96
The whole thing was a huge,
huge win for anybody.


40
0:1:43,96 --> 0:1:46,18
ROSS POWERS: I always looked at
it like, I want to just go,


41
0:1:46,18 --> 0:1:47,82
put on the best show I
can, have the best


42
0:1:47,82 --> 0:1:49,79
time, and go for it.


43
0:1:49,79 --> 0:1:52,92
And nowadays in snowboarding
there's so many events that it


44
0:1:52,92 --> 0:1:55,751
gets all the top riders
together, kind of end of the


45
0:1:55,751 --> 0:1:56,42
year battle.


46
0:1:56,42 --> 0:1:57,92
Everyone's been working
hard through the year.


47
0:1:57,92 --> 0:1:58,75
What tricks do you got?


48
0:1:58,75 --> 0:2:0,0
Throw them down.


49
0:2:0,0 --> 0:2:6,35



50
0:2:6,35 --> 0:2:8,71
TODD KOHLMAN: Just with the US
Open being like the longest


51
0:2:8,71 --> 0:2:14,52
running event in snowboarding,
and keeping it an open where


52
0:2:14,52 --> 0:2:17,51
people can sign up and then
work their way up to ride


53
0:2:17,51 --> 0:2:21,91
against the big riders kind
of has a soulful feel to


54
0:2:21,91 --> 0:2:22,67
snowboarding.


55
0:2:22,67 --> 0:2:23,92
Just back to the roots.


56
0:2:23,92 --> 0:2:28,47



57
0:2:28,47 --> 0:2:29,48
BARRY DUGAN: They were pros.


58
0:2:29,48 --> 0:2:31,84
You kind of knew who was going
to show up and contend.


59
0:2:31,84 --> 0:2:38,41
But there was always that
mystery about what teenager or


60
0:2:38,41 --> 0:2:41,59
tween was going to show
up and throw down.


61
0:2:41,59 --> 0:2:44,92
JASON FORD: Not only has it been
an iconic competition for


62
0:2:44,92 --> 0:2:47,71
Vermont and the East Coast, and
all the people that drive


63
0:2:47,71 --> 0:2:49,82
four or five hours
to attend it.


64
0:2:49,82 --> 0:2:52,65
But it's been good for
snowboarding, because having a


65
0:2:52,65 --> 0:2:57,67
US Open title, or win, or even
a podium has been, for many


66
0:2:57,67 --> 0:2:59,4
people, a highlight
in their career.


67
0:2:59,4 --> 0:3:1,17
TOM MONTEROSSO: You didn't
really have a lot of events on


68
0:3:1,17 --> 0:3:2,96
the East Coast that
you could go to.


69
0:3:2,96 --> 0:3:6,61
It was the US Open every March
where you could see


70
0:3:6,61 --> 0:3:7,69
[INAUDIBLE].


71
0:3:7,69 --> 0:3:9,38
Jamie Lynn would make
an appearance.


72
0:3:9,38 --> 0:3:14,45
Mike Michaelchuk, Jim Rippey,
Daniel Frank, all these icons.


73
0:3:14,45 --> 0:3:17,8
KELLY CLARK: The people who
drive up from Jersey all night


74
0:3:17,8 --> 0:3:23,17
and sleep in their car to come
watch the US Open, it's almost


75
0:3:23,17 --> 0:3:24,58
got like-- what do
you want to call?


76
0:3:24,58 --> 0:3:26,9
Like a cultish following.


77
0:3:26,9 --> 0:3:29,37
PAT BRIDGES: Just like kind of
like a meeting of the tribe.


78
0:3:29,37 --> 0:3:34,47
And you had all these college
kids, and ex-ski racers, and


79
0:3:34,47 --> 0:3:37,66
sort of like burnouts, drop
outs, kind of people who


80
0:3:37,66 --> 0:3:39,79
wanted to be a part
of a fringe group.


81
0:3:39,79 --> 0:3:43,75
SETH NEARY: I remember being at
the gondola and seeing Noah


82
0:3:43,75 --> 0:3:46,24
Salasnek and Chris Roach, and
just being completely


83
0:3:46,24 --> 0:3:46,83
starstruck.


84
0:3:46,83 --> 0:3:49,1
I mean, like holy shit,
these dudes are here.


85
0:3:49,1 --> 0:3:50,88
One hand you're kind of
like fanning out.


86
0:3:50,88 --> 0:3:52,76
But at the other side, you're
like competing.


87
0:3:52,76 --> 0:3:55,421
You want to compete against
them and win.


88
0:3:55,421 --> 0:4:7,6



89
0:4:7,6 --> 0:4:11,43
ANDY COHGLAN: Back then it was
just a straight shot downhill.


90
0:4:11,43 --> 0:4:14,47
I had Vans high top checkered
shoes on.


91
0:4:14,47 --> 0:4:16,45
Man, was it scary.


92
0:4:16,45 --> 0:4:18,13
You're just on this old--


93
0:4:18,13 --> 0:4:18,63
this stuff.


94
0:4:18,63 --> 0:4:20,49
It just made it so
much harder.


95
0:4:20,49 --> 0:4:24,36
JAKE BURTON: It was sort of
a daredevil type scene.


96
0:4:24,36 --> 0:4:26,4
Probably the appropriate word.


97
0:4:26,4 --> 0:4:28,87
And table upside down for
the starting gate.


98
0:4:28,87 --> 0:4:31,24
And it was wild because in the


99
0:4:31,24 --> 0:4:32,22
beginning, it was like downhills.


100
0:4:32,22 --> 0:4:34,36
I don't know, it's sort of
where we were at, just


101
0:4:34,36 --> 0:4:35,68
charging down the hill.


102
0:4:35,68 --> 0:4:37,15
DONNA CARPENTER: If you were
willing, you were welcome.


103
0:4:37,15 --> 0:4:39,52



104
0:4:39,52 --> 0:4:42,59
I do remember the first
woman rider.


105
0:4:42,59 --> 0:4:47,945
And she cried at the top for
like 20 minutes until we


106
0:4:47,945 --> 0:4:49,0
talked her into going.


107
0:4:49,0 --> 0:4:50,34
So it was very intimidating.


108
0:4:50,34 --> 0:4:52,4
I mean, it was these
alpine courses.


109
0:4:52,4 --> 0:4:52,9
They were icy.


110
0:4:52,9 --> 0:4:54,83
We didn't have great
equipment.


111
0:4:54,83 --> 0:4:57,73
ANDY COGHLAN: The US Open was
really important for Jake, and


112
0:4:57,73 --> 0:5:1,15
he took it over from Paul Graves
who ran the first one


113
0:5:1,15 --> 0:5:4,86
in Woodstock, Vermont,
in '82 and wasn't


114
0:5:4,86 --> 0:5:5,76
going to do it again.


115
0:5:5,76 --> 0:5:9,24
And so Jake, kind of out of
necessity, was trying to find


116
0:5:9,24 --> 0:5:14,24
a way to expose snowboarding
to the world.


117
0:5:14,24 --> 0:5:16,63
JAKE BURTON: The freestyle thing
hadn't really happened.


118
0:5:16,63 --> 0:5:19,26
And a lot of people look
back and say, why not?


119
0:5:19,26 --> 0:5:21,47
But it was a necessary time
for snowboarding.


120
0:5:21,47 --> 0:5:24,245
We had to develop boards,
riders had


121
0:5:24,245 --> 0:5:25,81
to develop the technique.


122
0:5:25,81 --> 0:5:27,92
And we had to develop product
that you could get down the


123
0:5:27,92 --> 0:5:30,45
hill on, and turn right, and
left, and stop, and do all


124
0:5:30,45 --> 0:5:33,15
those sort of necessary
functions.


125
0:5:33,15 --> 0:5:33,77
ANDY COGHLAN: It was great.


126
0:5:33,77 --> 0:5:37,8
I mean, especially when Burton
started making the halfpipe, I


127
0:5:37,8 --> 0:5:40,7
think the whole sport
really progressed.


128
0:5:40,7 --> 0:5:42,6
And the media really started
to cover it.


129
0:5:42,6 --> 0:5:44,14
TERRY KIDWELL: It was
1988, they had


130
0:5:44,14 --> 0:5:46,53
their first half pipe.


131
0:5:46,53 --> 0:5:48,4
And I was like surprised.


132
0:5:48,4 --> 0:5:49,73
We get out there and
they have this huge


133
0:5:49,73 --> 0:5:52,8
backhoe digging the pipe.


134
0:5:52,8 --> 0:5:54,48
That's the first time I've ever
seen a piece of equipment


135
0:5:54,48 --> 0:5:56,34
digging the walls for
us, probably the


136
0:5:56,34 --> 0:5:57,43
best pipe to date.


137
0:5:57,43 --> 0:5:58,76
I mean, it had to have been.


138
0:5:58,76 --> 0:6:2,78
Jake always put a lot of effort
into having that event


139
0:6:2,78 --> 0:6:4,81
be the event of the year.


140
0:6:4,81 --> 0:6:6,44
JAKE BURTON: We had Craig Kelly
riding for us at the


141
0:6:6,44 --> 0:6:9,11
time, and he was a phenomenal
pipe rider.


142
0:6:9,11 --> 0:6:11,57
I can remember that first year,
Terry Kidwell won it.


143
0:6:11,57 --> 0:6:15,54
And he and Craig would
just go at it.


144
0:6:15,54 --> 0:6:18,37
And it was an incredible
competition.


145
0:6:18,37 --> 0:6:20,51
It was super fun to see.


146
0:6:20,51 --> 0:6:21,65
ANDY COGHLAN: It was
also a kind of the


147
0:6:21,65 --> 0:6:23,21
changing of the guard.


148
0:6:23,21 --> 0:6:25,29
Because that was the year that
all the young guns were


149
0:6:25,29 --> 0:6:26,17
supposed to win.


150
0:6:26,17 --> 0:6:29,91
Terry Kidwell won the halfpipe
and I won the downhill.


151
0:6:29,91 --> 0:6:33,41
So the two old guys ended up
winning for one more year,


152
0:6:33,41 --> 0:6:37,98
until the young guys came the
next year and took over.


153
0:6:37,98 --> 0:6:40,8
MIKE HAYES: As soon as they
introduced the halfpipe,


154
0:6:40,8 --> 0:6:42,42
that's when we started to
see the crowds show up.


155
0:6:42,42 --> 0:6:46,27
Basically, the whole event
started to gravitate towards


156
0:6:46,27 --> 0:6:48,33
the freestyle events just
because that was the real


157
0:6:48,33 --> 0:6:49,67
crowd pleaser.


158
0:6:49,67 --> 0:6:52,72
It's a lot more fun to watch
the halfpipe than it is to


159
0:6:52,72 --> 0:6:54,86
watch some slalom races.


160
0:6:54,86 --> 0:6:57,92
And so eventually they phased
out the alpine events, and


161
0:6:57,92 --> 0:6:59,79
that's pretty much
when I retired.


162
0:6:59,79 --> 0:7:1,93
They retired me.


163
0:7:1,93 --> 0:7:4,31
PAT BRIDGES: I mean, it used
to be like an underground


164
0:7:4,31 --> 0:7:6,56
where you'd hear the Stratton
pipe got cut,


165
0:7:6,56 --> 0:7:7,39
and you'd go there.


166
0:7:7,39 --> 0:7:9,8
And then, part of the mythology
of the Open was the


167
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:13,44
fact that not only was it open
to competing, but once that


168
0:7:13,44 --> 0:7:16,62
last competitor dropped
in for the finals,


169
0:7:16,62 --> 0:7:17,56
that pipe was open.


170
0:7:17,56 --> 0:7:18,81
And it was mayhem.


171
0:7:18,81 --> 0:7:27,15



172
0:7:27,15 --> 0:7:28,64
CHRIS COPLEY: As an announcer,
it was really tough.


173
0:7:28,64 --> 0:7:33,51
Because we would have to say,
all right, hold the course.


174
0:7:33,51 --> 0:7:35,83
They're cutting to a commercial
right now.


175
0:7:35,83 --> 0:7:37,93
And so everyone's standing
around going, what--


176
0:7:37,93 --> 0:7:39,21
come on, man.


177
0:7:39,21 --> 0:7:41,78
It broke up the whole
flow of the event.


178
0:7:41,78 --> 0:7:45,16
And then, like a couple dudes
were like, hey, I don't care.


179
0:7:45,16 --> 0:7:46,19
I'm just bombing it.


180
0:7:46,19 --> 0:7:49,32
And they would just cut under
the fence and charge it.


181
0:7:49,32 --> 0:7:50,75
And the crowd would
go so berserk.


182
0:7:50,75 --> 0:7:58,5



183
0:7:58,5 --> 0:7:59,45
HANNAH TETER: People loved
to see the [INAUDIBLE]


184
0:7:59,45 --> 0:7:59,94
in between.


185
0:7:59,94 --> 0:8:3,82
It just adds the fun element to
it and the non-seriousness


186
0:8:3,82 --> 0:8:5,98
effect kind of goes away,
which is nice.


187
0:8:5,98 --> 0:8:7,88
JAKE BURTON: Not that anybody's
encouraging


188
0:8:7,88 --> 0:8:8,83
anybody to do it.


189
0:8:8,83 --> 0:8:11,1
I mean, you've got to have a
certain amount of balls.


190
0:8:11,1 --> 0:8:15,14
Abe Teter, I think, probably
gets the best career poacher.


191
0:8:15,14 --> 0:8:17,7
I mean, that guy just
always went huge.


192
0:8:17,7 --> 0:8:20,54
And people loved to see him
ride, so nobody ever


193
0:8:20,54 --> 0:8:23,84
complained about it.


194
0:8:23,84 --> 0:8:25,26
BARRY DUGAN: It was to see who
was going to be king and


195
0:8:25,26 --> 0:8:26,77
queen, that's for damn sure.


196
0:8:26,77 --> 0:8:28,86
But it was to have a lot
of fun doing it.


197
0:8:28,86 --> 0:8:31,61
And be within touching distance
and getting the high


198
0:8:31,61 --> 0:8:34,504
fives from the crowd, and being
able to hear that roar


199
0:8:34,504 --> 0:8:37,24
and walk through the crowd and
be at the same parties with


200
0:8:37,24 --> 0:8:38,0
the athletes.


201
0:8:38,0 --> 0:8:41,0
I think that's the legacy
of the Open, is being


202
0:8:41,0 --> 0:8:42,52
the best of the best.


203
0:8:42,52 --> 0:8:44,95
TERRY KIDWELL: There are a lot
of big events around the world


204
0:8:44,95 --> 0:8:49,92
from the past to the present,
but I think US Open has stood


205
0:8:49,92 --> 0:8:50,92
the test of time.


206
0:8:50,92 --> 0:8:54,37
I'm super stoked to
hear they're going


207
0:8:54,37 --> 0:8:55,72
into their 30th year.


208
0:8:55,72 --> 0:8:56,97
That is super cool.


209
0:8:56,97 --> 0:10:56,97
