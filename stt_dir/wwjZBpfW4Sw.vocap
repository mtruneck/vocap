###1 STEVE SPANGLER: My hand is freezing.
###3 How do whales stay in ocean water that's this cold?
###6 Which got me to thinking, why is there a tub of lard sitting
###10 right here and how does it relate to this ice water?
###14 I have no idea.
###15 But I have about 30 seconds to figure it out
###17 while you watch this.
###19 I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all about making science fun.
###23 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###26 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable
###29 experiences.
###30 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###32 affect the way people think about science.
###35 And to do that, I live in one motto--
###37 make it big, do it right, give it class.
###40 
###46 So here's the challenge I have for you.
###47 Get a bucket, get some water, get some ice-- not any kind of
###50 ice, glacial ice.
###52 It's straight from Alaska, costs $50,000.
###56 If you want extreme cold, pour some salt in there.
###59 It'll drop the temperature to about 17 degrees Fahrenheit.
###62 Then plunge your hand into the water like this and see how
###65 long you can keep it there.
###66 You don't want to stick your hand in?
###67 Get a friend like Higginsworth.
###69 See?
###69 Higginsworth, put your hand in.
###71 Now leave it there for a long time.
###72 See, this got me to thinking--
###73 how is it that whales can stay in this incredibly cold
###76 temperatures?
###77 Well, the answer is all the blubber that's around them.
###80 So we're going to create ourselves a little blubber bag
###83 that will allow you to be able to stay in
###84 the water for hours.
###85 So how you doing now, Higginsworth?
###89 See, kids?
###90 He tapped out.
###91 You'll always do better than Higginsworth.
###93 See, I'm not the only one thinking about whales.
###95 A hundred science enthusiasts joined us for an experience
###98 called Science at Sea.
###99 It was a cruise to Alaska with Holland America, where we got
###102 to see whales breaching and ice calving and some of the
###104 most amazing things in Alaska.
###107 The naturalists are the ones that pointed out this quick
###109 little demonstration that you can do with vegetable
###112 shortening, a Ziploc bag, and some duct tape to understand
###115 how whales withstand these incredible temperatures.
###119 Step one, find yourself that vegetable shortening and put
###122 it inside of a Ziploc bag.
###124 So you're going to try to get it down inside this little
###125 Ziploc bag.
###127 You've just got to try to keep it away from the little top
###131 here so that it doesn't get real greasy at the top.
###133 You're going to want to put three or four really good
###135 scoops in the Ziploc bag.
###137 See, all this vegetable shortening is going to
###139 simulate the blubber.
###140 
###142 Right.
###143 Now you take the second bag.
###144 This is the bag that your hand will go in and stay clean.
###148 And this now goes into the first bag with all of that
###153 vegetable shortening.
###155 Flatten it out.
###157 Push it down.
###159 And now you have the start of a blubber bag.
###163 Once you have all of that shortening spread out, then
###166 you're going to want to take the top bag here and actually
###169 fold it inside out, trapping all of the shortening inside.
###175 And now, to make sure that nothing comes out you take
###178 some duct tape and you seal it up.
###183 Perfect.
###184 You got a blubber bag.
###186 Take a look at this.
###187 You see, all of the shortening is trapped between the two
###190 layers here of plastic bag, allowing you to put your hand
###193 inside and feel it, yet it doesn't get dirty.
###197 Remember the challenge at the very beginning-- how long can
###199 you keep your hand in?
###200 Well, just stick your hand in the blubber glove and now
###203 plunge it down inside, you can stay there forever.
###206 It really is very, very warm down inside.
###209 See, that the layer of fat really is a great insulator,
###213 keeping the heat in and the cold out.
###215 You can stay here for the longest time.
###218 If you've ever heard the term "barrel of oil," it actually
###221 came from the whaling industry.
###224 See, whaling was huge and whale oil was a big deal.
###226 In the early 1800s, they were a little concerned about what
###229 would happen because the supply of whales kept on
###232 diminishing until about 1865.
###234 Whales were nearly extinct and we had to move to petroleum.
###238 Now that you know how these creatures can withstand these
###240 incredible temperatures, just imagine seeing them up close.
###243 Well, that's what happened with a hundred science
###245 enthusiasts as they joined us for Science at Sea.

###438 See, using a blubber glove, I could have my hand in this
###441 water forever.
