###0 a bill passed us state senate up comedian new jersey that would ban the
###4 practice of homosexual conversion therapy that we thought that the other
###7 times on this show now love the governor of new jersey first christy has
###12 previously seemed to indicate that he's against it
###15 uh... we have a spokesman for murrieta ca melaka spoke so uh... woman for
###19 discussed his campaign
###21 uh... there's no mistaking his point of view on this
###23 when you look at is own prior statements where he makes clear that people's
###26 sexual orientation
###28 is determined that birth
###30 uh... so he seems to be against it now will he actually sign a bill that would
###34 ban this practice
###36 if that's still in question actually and we've got a quote from him that leaves
###39 it very much open at this point he says i'd love to mines just on this stuff in
###43 general
###44 number one i think there should be lots of deference given the parents and
###47 raising their children
###48 until this is a general philosophy not that he's built generally
###52 philosophically on bills that mister testability
###55 to make decisions on how to care for their children i'm generally a skeptic
###59 of those bills now there could always be exceptions to those rules and this bill
###62 may be one of the yet his reasoning doesn't make any sense of the reason i
###66 say that is because we have lost
###68 that prevents appearance for abusing their kids and a conversion therapy is
###72 abuse there is this is where they use electric shock therapy and we can you
###77 see it knowledge himself that homosexuality is not a choice it's
###80 something that you're bored with
###81 so you can't change someone's sexuality and in essence you're putting that child
###85 to torture so i don't want to present a favorable bell you know as a moral opt
###90 passed in california that i was very very happy about and i think that it
###94 would be responsible for chris christine not to sign up now and i can not even
###97 sure what his justification would be otherwise i mean we don't use unleashes
###101 anymore in a medical treatment so you know with the in favor of that the
###105 parent dot that that was ok time need to have my parental rights to but which is
###109 on my kids and they can get over the flu or to stop being so
###112 returned to me and i did it doesn't make any sense it's completely logical and
###117 knowing that he uh... chris christy is up for re-election in november i'd think
###121 it's very interesting that they are using this as rival and democratic
###124 senator barbara born is using that as for uh... primary act act against the
###130 christian right now separate yeah of course we should bear in mind that she's
###133 really losing by quite a bit now her her name recognition obviously quite low
###137 levels to chris christie known around the country so she is suffering from
###140 every now
###141 uh... such as jumping on the issues using as part of our campaign report her
###145 is intolerance has no place in our state the governor said he doesn't know much
###149 about gay conversion therapy
###150 but i don't know how much you need to know
###153 it's a good point guard
###154 look i personally i'm in favor of more information regardless of if it's uh...
###157 subject i personally find abort
###160 uh... now there's no surprise obviously that you should jump on that she will
###163 jump on this it has jumped on this
###165 i think that
###167 you could have sort of a a debate look i i would guess that the the conversion
###171 therapy obviously
###172 uh... it's easy for us to say that it's torture i think that you could have
###175 counseling or something like that now you can tell you if i understand i'm
###179 against it but i'm saying it's easy for us to simply say it is tortured us you
###183 cannot
###184 but if we're looking to convince people who think that it might be reasonable or
###187 currently in favor of it is not enough to simply say it's torture
###190 son that's been a more detailed about what the bill includes so it doesn't
###194 straight out bad a conversion there be offensive for up people under the age of
###198 eighteen
###199 if you are tied to halt side you would be able to get dating free conversion
###203 therapy obligor out not sure if god this bill includes a bit in california fear
###209 above the age of eighteen he would have to sign some sort of form indicating
###213 that you are aware that this is complete and utter bullshit and it's not
###217 medically proven to work or anything like that uh... but
###221 no i i don't even think that you should have counseling that that tries to
###224 convince you that being gay is wrong and you should become straight states not
###227 scientifically proven innocent either child abuse and i've has forced kids to
###232 go into some kind of that their api to talk to that
###234 a psychologist because his nose like holidays i would hope
###237 that would agree with the idea that you can actually get to talk there appear
###241 confident european order to not be gaining via look at this industries
###244 right now dont having psychologists are convinced of it but having like priests
###248 who want to get a room and to hug therapy with these
###251 these kids who think that the medicare fee what they are going after the
###254 landmark is sparkling and the kids as rocks off by you know doing is they're
###258 that these therapy sessions and it's not that it's in that very carefully setting
###262 out making up a tenant for this
###264 yet and let's bear in mind what's probably underlying first receives for a
###268 waffling on this issue probably has less to do with him not being as short work
###271 these days and he says that he is against it
###274 which is admirable i think that if he was not uh...
###277 i think that the election that's going on right now for further get the
###280 governorship of new jersey ave desperately was thinking about
###283 begins probably looking at between sixteen
###285 now it's interesting because chris christie has this mystique of being like
###289 the new rebel in the party like he's not just about out anything
###293 the republican leadership says they should do generally i think that makes
###295 sense because he does
###297 but the party line more than most
###299 but he's going to be entering into a national rural republican primary
###302 contest and that's not the place where being a rebel is going to to benefit you
###306 like
###307 there there are republicans who are very much in favor of here at the present
###310 because they think that it could be a democrat
###312 but that's very different story from uh... beating other republicans in
###316 if he comes out strongly against it and seems like he's too in favor
###320 of gay marriage and other gay rights issues
###322 but that's gonna be positive from our point of view but the people voting
###326 you know in iowa and new hampshire on the republican side are necessarily
###329 donald gregg
