ROCCO CASTORO: There is a place
in Russia where people


4
0:0:13,92 --> 0:0:18,38
have discovered the secret of
living in perfect harmony.


5
0:0:18,38 --> 0:0:22,83
A place where the children run
free, where the Earth provides


6
0:0:22,83 --> 0:0:28,33
everything you need, and where
money is meaningless.

over 100 miles away from the


10
0:0:40,6 --> 0:0:41,555

11

It looks like an elf village at,
like, a putt-putt course.


12
0:0:47,36 --> 0:0:50,5
About 20 years ago a handful
of disciples came here to


13
0:0:50,5 --> 0:0:52,94
worship and live with Vissarion,
or "the teacher,"


14
0:0:52,94 --> 0:0:55,43
as he is commonly known.


15
0:0:55,43 --> 0:0:58,1
Today, Vissarion's Church of
the Last Testament has over


16
0:0:58,1 --> 0:1:1,8

hopes of meeting the man


21
0:1:17,13 --> 0:1:19,86

ROCCO CASTORO: Two decades ago,
that man was known as


27
0:1:40,74 --> 0:1:44,69
Sergey Anatolyevitch Torop, a
29-year-old patrol officer who


28
0:1:44,69 --> 0:1:47,73
suddenly had a revelation that
his was the word of God.

VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

0:1:51,19 --> 0:1:53,7
ROCCO CASTORO: Conveniently,
this realization happened


31
0:1:53,7 --> 0:1:55,1
right around the time
the Soviet Union, a


32
0:1:55,1 --> 0:1:57,85
self-proclaimed nation of
atheists, began to crumble,


33
0:1:57,85 --> 0:1:59,69
and religion became an
acceptable topic of

He soon began writing the Last
Testament, a 12-volume

follow-up of sorts to the New
Testament, which details the


37
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:10,83
religion's major tenets and
provides answers to some of


38
0:2:10,83 --> 0:2:14,47

Labeled a dangerous cult by
some, it has been reported


41
0:2:19,71 --> 0:2:22,72
that Vissarion and his followers
believe in aliens,


42
0:2:22,72 --> 0:2:25,71
think suicide is A-OK, and
believe that the end of the


43
0:2:25,71 --> 0:2:28,3
world is imminent.


44
0:2:28,3 --> 0:2:29,87
There are rules here that
I was warned about--


45
0:2:29,87 --> 0:2:33,42
no cussing, no tobacco,
no alcohol, no meat.


46
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:34,99
I believe it's all vegan.


47
0:2:34,99 --> 0:2:38,19
I've got to watch my mouth
because I have a dirty mouth.


48
0:2:38,19 --> 0:2:44,252
And I like meat, I like
drugs, sometimes.


49
0:2:44,252 --> 0:2:48,995
There's none of that here, so
it's going be good to dry up.


50
0:2:48,995 --> 0:2:51,44
I was invited here by one of
the church's more recent


51

named Tamriko, who worked as a

here three months ago.

Why don't you give me a little
history of how you got here?

TAMRIKO DGEBUADZE: When I first
heard about the teacher,


57
0:3:9,71 --> 0:3:12,64
it was me like this kind
of thing that-- wow.


58
0:3:12,64 --> 0:3:15,51
It was like, this is the only
source of all information, of


59
0:3:15,51 --> 0:3:19,89
all answers, and this is a
real teacher of the truth


60
0:3:19,89 --> 0:3:20,71
about the world.


61
0:3:20,71 --> 0:3:21,235
And so--

0:3:21,235 --> 0:3:21,622
ROCCO CASTORO: Something
feels--


63
0:3:21,622 --> 0:3:22,18
TAMRIKO DGEBUADZE: And sometimes
you need answers.


64
0:3:22,18 --> 0:3:23,25
You need, just, answers.

will explain you,

0:3:27,78 --> 0:3:28,95

70
0:3:28,95 --> 0:3:30,75
Why you have some problems--


71
0:3:30,75 --> 0:3:33,88
problems with your health,
problems with your life.


72
0:3:33,88 --> 0:3:35,94
For what purpose, actually,
you are living.


73
0:3:35,94 --> 0:3:37,1
ROCCO CASTORO: I see.


74
0:3:37,1 --> 0:3:38,58
And one of the things that a
lot of people have said is


75
0:3:38,58 --> 0:3:40,35
like, oh, it's a cult.


76
0:3:40,35 --> 0:3:40,96
You know?


77
0:3:40,96 --> 0:3:42,495
How do you feel about that?


78
0:3:42,495 --> 0:3:43,86
It has a bad connotation.


79
0:3:43,86 --> 0:3:44,18
TAMRIKO DGEBUADZE: Usually,
I don't think


80
0:3:44,18 --> 0:3:44,96
anything about this.


81
0:3:44,96 --> 0:3:45,7
Do you know why?


82
0:3:45,7 --> 0:3:49,88
Because I think that if some
people find that this person


83
0:3:49,88 --> 0:3:52,29
can help them, and they
want to pray to


84
0:3:52,29 --> 0:3:53,52
this person, why not?

0:3:53,52 --> 0:3:54,3

not, it's very good.

that you perhaps

Still, all the followers had
been very pleasant so far.

Only a few seemed to have the
crazy stare of a cult member.


162
0:7:50,47 --> 0:7:53,705
I ran into Maciek and asked him
how he was settling in.


163
0:7:53,705 --> 0:7:55,51
So how have the accommodations
been?

accommodations--


165

0:7:59,67 --> 0:8:1,5
We had a nice conversation.

0:8:4,995 --> 0:8:7,14
his teachings.


170

And I said, well, I'm not
really a follower.

a minute of silence--

Good Fruits, the Church of the

Basically, it's their Easter.

It was on this day in 1990 when
Vissarion first realized

his divine connection to God
and established his church.

Part of the reason I wanted
to come here--

the world seems to be in a
pretty bad way right now.


225
0:10:32,71 --> 0:10:36,44
This seems to be an idyllic
community, so maybe Vissarion


226
0:10:36,44 --> 0:10:39,67
has some answers for
us on how we could


227
0:10:39,67 --> 0:10:41,2
better live our lives.

got it right, and

0:18:20,55 --> 0:18:21,77
Does he seem in good spirits?

0:18:23,2 --> 0:18:37,22



402
0:18:37,22 --> 0:18:39,5
ROCCO CASTORO: After the
liturgy, we ran into our


403
0:18:39,5 --> 0:18:40,54
Polish friend, Maciek.


404
0:18:40,54 --> 0:18:41,28
ROCCO CASTORO: How
do you feel?


405
0:18:41,28 --> 0:18:43,42
I mean, do you feel that there's
something about him


406
0:18:43,42 --> 0:18:45,38
that's beyond human?


407
0:18:45,38 --> 0:18:46,78
MACIEJ RAFINSIC: I don't
want to insult anybody,


408
0:18:46,78 --> 0:18:48,83
but I don't, no.


409
0:18:48,83 --> 0:18:50,955
I feel it's an interesting
place and


410
0:18:50,955 --> 0:18:51,91
an interesting person.


411
0:18:51,91 --> 0:18:53,69
And I think these people
around me want


412
0:18:53,69 --> 0:18:56,2
to live a good life.


413
0:18:56,2 --> 0:18:57,75
And I do appreciate that.


414
0:18:57,75 --> 0:19:1,94
But I don't perceive
him as divine.


415
0:19:1,94 --> 0:19:3,43
ROCCO CASTORO: After mingling
with some members of the


416
0:19:3,43 --> 0:19:6,75
congregation, I headed to bed
to rest up for the next day


417
0:19:6,75 --> 0:19:8,84
and my big interview
with Vissarion.


418
0:19:8,84 --> 0:19:10,26
There's a lot of
stars tonight.


419
0:19:10,26 --> 0:19:12,9
I was talking with Slava about
the beautiful and clear


420
0:19:12,9 --> 0:19:16,17
nighttime sky, when he told me
that stars weren't the only


421
0:19:16,17 --> 0:19:18,95
things up there.


422
0:19:18,95 --> 0:19:20,2
ROCCO CASTORO: You've
seen UFOs?


423
0:19:20,2 --> 0:19:23,3



424
0:19:23,3 --> 0:19:24,28
ROCCO CASTORO: What
did it look like?


425
0:19:24,28 --> 0:19:29,234



426
0:19:29,234 --> 0:19:30,31
ROCCO CASTORO: Three spheres.


427
0:19:30,31 --> 0:19:33,37
Yeah, OK.


428
0:19:33,37 --> 0:19:34,62
ROCCO CASTORO: See it too?


429
0:19:34,62 --> 0:19:37,25



430
0:19:37,25 --> 0:19:40,45
The next morning, we got up
bright and early and took a


431
0:19:40,45 --> 0:19:42,51
secret path to Vissarion's
home.


432
0:19:42,51 --> 0:19:46,4
So we're finally here at
the teacher's house.


433
0:19:46,4 --> 0:19:48,615
And we're going to interview a
man that many people believe


434
0:19:48,615 --> 0:19:51,11
to be the word of god.


435
0:19:51,11 --> 0:19:53,5
I suddenly became very
anxious about my


436
0:19:53,5 --> 0:19:54,63
meeting with the teacher.


437
0:19:54,63 --> 0:19:57,13
What if I actually had an
audience with someone who is


438
0:19:57,13 --> 0:20:1,162
the word, and perhaps
flesh, of god?

0:20:2,412 --> 0:20:5,5

0:20:5,5 --> 0:20:7,38
Why did you agree to an
interview with me?


442
0:20:7,38 --> 0:20:11,945
Because I know that you haven't
for quite a bit.

445
0:20:16,5 --> 0:20:17,75
Are you regretting it now?


446
0:20:17,75 --> 0:20:20,328



447
0:20:20,328 --> 0:20:21,72
OK.


448
0:20:21,72 --> 0:20:24,2
I want to know about Russia.


449
0:20:24,2 --> 0:20:28,67
Was it a coincidence, or was it
just happenstance that this


450
0:20:28,67 --> 0:20:33,0
community came to be around the
same time as the fall of


451
0:20:33,0 --> 0:20:34,51
the Soviet Union?

0:20:35,76 --> 0:20:56,4



454
0:20:56,4 --> 0:20:58,66
ROCCO CASTORO: I think I
understood what he was saying.


455
0:20:58,66 --> 0:21:1,15
But I was struggling with how
to tactfully ask someone who


456
0:21:1,15 --> 0:21:4,48
looks like Jesus if he's the Son
of God without coming out


457
0:21:4,48 --> 0:21:5,71
and saying it.


458
0:21:5,71 --> 0:21:8,21
You're very Christ-like
in your appearance.


459
0:21:8,21 --> 0:21:13,95
I'll say it this way-- do you
have memories of Christ from


460
0:21:13,95 --> 0:21:15,325
2,000 years ago?


461
0:21:15,325 --> 0:21:18,72
Do you carry on in that
way, in that lineage?

464
0:21:47,79 --> 0:21:49,98
ROCCO CASTORO: That's probably
as close to a yes as I was


465
0:21:49,98 --> 0:21:51,8
going to get.


466
0:21:51,8 --> 0:21:52,56
It seems like the world is--


467
0:21:52,56 --> 0:21:53,93
there's lots of riots.


468
0:21:53,93 --> 0:21:54,94
There's uprisings.


469
0:21:54,94 --> 0:21:59,2
Is the turmoil and conflict in
the world right now worse than


470
0:21:59,2 --> 0:22:0,76
you've experienced?

0:22:17,76 --> 0:22:20,4
ROCCO CASTORO: Was Vissarion
talking about Armageddon?


474
0:22:20,4 --> 0:22:23,46
Naturally, I was curious as
to when that might happen.


475
0:22:23,46 --> 0:22:25,574
Is that coming soon?

ROCCO CASTORO: Talk about
dancing around the subject.


479
0:22:37,96 --> 0:22:40,7
I switched gears, and,
remembering Slava's


480
0:22:40,7 --> 0:22:42,82
extraterrestrial encounter,
asked him about the church's


481
0:22:42,82 --> 0:22:46,77
stance on what they call
"the outer space mind."

0:22:48,2 --> 0:23:11,4



484
0:23:11,4 --> 0:23:13,61
ROCCO CASTORO: I have to admit,
Vissarion lost me


485
0:23:13,61 --> 0:23:16,68
somewhere in between the end
times and soulless aliens.


486
0:23:16,68 --> 0:23:18,98
Still, I could see how his
followers could really get


487
0:23:18,98 --> 0:23:20,36
into this stuff.


488
0:23:20,36 --> 0:23:22,53
It's a hell of a lot more
interesting than Adam and Eve


489
0:23:22,53 --> 0:23:24,74
and the crucifixion.


490
0:23:24,74 --> 0:23:26,28
The teacher's handlers
signalled that it was


491
0:23:26,28 --> 0:23:27,3
time to wrap up.


492
0:23:27,3 --> 0:23:30,22
But I was determined to slip
in a few simple questions


493
0:23:30,22 --> 0:23:32,13
that, with any luck, would
be answered in a


494
0:23:32,13 --> 0:23:33,37
straightforward manner.


495
0:23:33,37 --> 0:23:34,76
How about food.

without penchant--


500
0:23:50,96 --> 0:23:53,56
which apparently extended to
answering questions in a


501
0:23:53,56 --> 0:23:55,385
fashion that I could
understand.


502
0:23:55,385 --> 0:23:57,31
But this was my last shot.


503
0:23:57,31 --> 0:23:59,74
At the very least, maybe I could
glean something about


504
0:23:59,74 --> 0:24:1,65
the purity of my own being.

0:24:17,94 --> 0:24:22,43
If you could tell one piece of

what would it be?

I'm not sure if I was supposed
to or not, but there is no way

I was leaving without a photo.

0:24:45,38 --> 0:24:48,368

What can I say?


526
0:25:4,22 --> 0:25:6,82
I'm a man of modern
convenience.


527
0:25:6,82 --> 0:25:9,5
But if it ever gets too much
for me, if the scum of


528
0:25:9,5 --> 0:25:12,7
humanity becomes so sticky and
viscous that I can't scrub it


529
0:25:12,7 --> 0:25:15,27
off, I know there's a place

0:25:22,52 --> 0:25:23,94
just tell them--

0:25:23,94 --> 0:25:27,15
there's this place you can go
