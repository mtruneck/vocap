###0 Hi everyone.
###1 I'm Dr. Craig Hazen, director of the master's degree program in Christian Apologetics at
###6 Biola University in Southern California.
###9 Although our campus is thousands of miles away from tonight's debate on the campus of
###14 Purdue, Biola University has become a center point
###16 for discussion and engagements on the big ideas
###19 that have really challenged humankind for centuries-like tonight's big question:
###25 Is faith in God Reasonable?
###27 I want to thank Biola University's partners for the live streaming of this event.
###31 The first partner is Symposia Christi which is a coalition of campus ministry groups at
###37 Purdue, and the second is Reasonable Faith - the organization
###41 that supports the scholarship, speaking, and debates of Dr. William Lane Craig.
###46 We're joined this evening by 5,000 people on the Purdue campus
###50 and tens of thousands from around the world who have signed in to watch this important
###55 exchange of ideas.
###56 One of our goals in bringing this debate to you live
###60 is to help ignite a robust dialogue. And we want you to be part of the conversation.
###65 So fire up Twitter and tweet commentary for the world.
###70 You can also submit questions to the debaters online to be answered during the live Q&A.
###77 Now, once tonight's debate is over there's a good chance you'll want to see it again
###81 or alert others to it so they can watch. If so, just point them to a site called Open
###88 Biola. But jot down the address for yourself as well
###92 because there is a treasure trove of quality academic content
###95 at that site -- and it's all for free.
###98 So be sure to check it out.
###100 The debaters you will see tonight are both academic philosophers and are at the top of
###106 their game.
###108 Answering "no" to the question "is faith in God reasonable?" will be
###113 Dr. Alex Rosenberg who is the R. Taylor Cole Professor of Philosophy at Duke University
###120 and head of the Philosophy Department. He's a prolific author having written over
###124 a dozen books and hundreds of articles. His latest book is titled "An Atheist's Guide
###130 to Reality."
###132 On the other side of platform tonight and answering "yes" to the question "is faith
###136 in God reasonable?" will be
###138 Dr. William Lane Craig who is a Research Professor of Philosophy at the Talbot School of Theology
###145 at Biola University. Dr. Craig is likewise an author of dozens
###149 of books and hundreds of articles.
###151 And of course Dr. William Lane Craig teaches courses in my own department --
###156 the master of arts degree program in Christian Apologetics at Biola,
###160 which has been voted the best program of its kind in the world on several occasions.

###258 Enjoy the debate and we'll see you on Twitter!
###262 Mr. Miller: Good evening and welcome! Come on in and let's have a seat.
###276 Thank you for coming. Given the vastness of the audience that would
###280 be watching this debate tonight here and across the world,
###284 you know sometimes and at some places in America we like to say,
###290 "LLLLets get ready to rumblllllle." It's going to be an exciting night.
###299 Welcome to the main event - The Symposium 2013 where the theme is The Foolishness of
###305 Faith.
###306 The Christian faith is often viewed as foolishness by those who don't believe it
###311 and it is viewed as life preserving and giving by those who do.
###317 The purpose of the symposium annually is to explore and debate
###320 some of the most probing questions about faith, reason, and life
###324 through lectures, panel discussions, and debates such as this.
###329 We welcome those of you attending tonight's debate here at Elliot Hall of Music at Purdue
###333 University and we welcome those watching this live streaming,
###339 some estimated 10,000. (Audience clapping).
###347 Those 10,000 people represent people from every state in America
###353 and as of 10 a.m. this morning from over 60 countries across the world.
###358 This is great. (Audience clapping).
###363 We're happy to include translators tonight so that the deaf community
###366 can participate in this for years to come when we put this on YouTube by the end of
###371 the month. We are thankful for more than 40 sponsors
###374 many of which were included on the screen behind me.
###377 As you were entering, perhaps you saw that, or in the brochures, or on our website at
###382 www.symposiachristi.com. We're also grateful to Purdue's Philosophy
###389 Department for sharing the cost of flying in one of our debaters so that he could
###393 speak in their department yesterday.
###396 My name is Mr. Corey Miller. I will be the moderator for tonight's debate
###400 and the MC throughout the weekend, where we've got a fantastic series of talks
###406 scheduled for you by a dozen speakers, maybe 35 talks on issues relevant to tonight's
###413 debate. I'm on staff with Faculty Commons, the Faculty
###417 Ministry of Cru. I direct the Christian Faculty Staff Network
###420 here at Purdue. I'm also a PhD candidate in Philosophical
###424 Theology and teach adjunct courses in Philosophy and Comparative Religions at
###429 Indiana University in Kokomo.
###432 Our Purdue audience should have a pencil and paper that you were given on your way in
###436 to fill out some basic information including your vote on who won tonight's debate
###442 and you can do that by pencil or completed online at www.biola.edu/debate.
###451 It should go without saying but please wait until after the debate to decide who won.
###455 I know some of us just love our guy that's going to be up here,
###459 but it's more fun this way if you wait until after the debate.
###462 We'll collect these right after the debate and prior to the question and answer time,
###467 so please write legibly if you're writing.
###470 We also want to welcome some special dignitaries who will help formally judge tonight's debate,
###478 wait until all of them are announced, and then please welcome the judges.
###482 Judges once I announce you individually please stand up and greet the audience.
###487 First of all John Schultz, a fifth year PhD student in political science
###491 and head of the Purdue Petticrew Debate Forum. He will head up the judge team and has helped
###496 organized and formed this judge team tonight.
###500 Sheila Klinker is on her way. Sheila, she never misses a beat; she'll be
###511 here. Sheila graduated from Purdue and is a member
###513 of the Indiana State Senate. I'm sorry no ... House of Representatives,
###518 a Democratic representing ... that's smooth, the enemy, representing the
###523 27th district since 1982.
###527 Ron Alting graduated from Purdue and is a member of the Indiana State Senate,
###531 a Republican representing the 22nd district serving Tippecanoe County.
###536 Aaron Trembath and an alum of Purdue's Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program.
###541 He is the President and CEO of NanoBio Interfacing Systems and Nano Technology-Based Diagnostics
###548 Company in Purdue Research Park. Before coaching Purdue's speech and debate
###554 team, he was pretty successful in debate himself.
###557 Professor Fenggang Yang from Purdue University, a Professor of Sociology, and Director of
###562 the Center on Religion and Chinese society. The professor previously taught philosophy
###569 at a university in Beijing, China.
###572 Professor Martin Medhurst is a Distinguished Professor of Rhetoric and Communication
###577 and Professor of Political Science at Baylor University, in Waco, Texas.
###588 Clarke Rountree, another professor also flown in here just recently like Dr. Medhurst.
###594 He is Professor and Chair of the Communications Arts Faculty flown in tonight from the University
###599 of Alabama in Huntsville.
###600 Let's welcome our distinguished guests. (Audience clapping).
###613 A colleague, Paul Gould, and myself will be editing a book to be published by
###617 Routledge based on the proceedings of tonight's debate
###620 which will include the two debaters we'll announce in a moment,
###623 the two Rhetoric professors we just mentioned and two other philosophers
###627 and two physics professors with an equal divide of Christians and atheist along the lines.
###633 The debate tonight will continue under the forthcoming title Is Faith in God Reasonable,
###638 Debates in Philosophy, Science and Rhetoric. We'll let you know when that comes out through
###642 your contact information, so make sure you give us the basic information.
###647 Turning to the corner here, the famous anti-theist Samuel Clemens, otherwise
###652 known as Mark Twain once said, "Faith is believing something you know ain't
###658 true." I don't know if that has unanimous consent.
###663 The most famous of Jewish and Christian philosophers perhaps of all time, at least in a particular
###669 period, Moses Maimonides and Thomas Aquinas believed
###672 that faith is a virtue. Indeed Aquinas went so far as to say that
###678 "Without faith, the virtue of faith, none of the other virtues are even virtuous."
###682 John Calvin, the Protestant Reformer, claimed that,
###685 "It would be the height of absurdity to label ignorance tempered by humility, faith;
###690 for faith consists in the knowledge of God." For Maimonides, Aquinas and Calvin then, faith
###698 is part of a knowledge tradition. Yet in contemporary times, the Philosopher
###704 Norman Malcolm has said that "In our Western academic philosophy, religious
###708 belief is commonly regarded as unreasonable and is viewed with condescension or even contempt."
###714 "It is said that religion is a refuge for those who,
###717 because of weakness of intellect or character, they're unable to confront the stern realities
###724 of the world." "The objective, mature, strong attitude is
###727 to hold beliefs solely on the basis of evidence."
###730 To this provocative statement much, can, and should,
###735 and now will be said as we turn toward tonight's debate over the question,
###739 is faith in God reasonable?
###743 Our first debater will argue the affirmative and consequently will go first
###746 as is the tradition when taking the affirmative position.
###750 William Lane Craig is Research Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology in
###753 La Mirada, California. He earned a Doctorate in Philosophy at the
###757 University of Birmingham England before taking a Doctorate in Theology from
###761 Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany.
###766 Prior to his appointment at Talbot, he spent several years at the Higher Institute of Philosophy
###771 of the Catholic University Louvain, Belgium. He has authored and edited over 30 books including
###777 the Kalam Cosmological Argument, Assessing the New Testament Evidence for the
###782 Historicity of the Resurrection of Jesus, Theism, Atheism, and Big Bang Cosmology,
###789 and God, Time and Eternity, as well as over a hundred articles in professional
###794 journals of philosophy and theology such as the Journal of Philosophy, New Testament Studies,
###800 Philosophical Studies, Philosophy, the British Journal for Philosophy of Science.
###805 He is considered to be one of the foremost defenders of the Christian faith.
###809 His book here, third edition, Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics matches his
###815 website which is reasonablefaith.org. Please welcome with me Dr. William Lane Craig.
###826 (Audience clapping)
###829 Dr. Craig: Thank you.
###835 Mr. Miller: Our next debater will argue the negative and consequently will go second.
###843 He will have the final word in the debate. Alex Rosenberg is the R. Taylor Cole Professor
###848 of Philosophy and Department Head at Duke University
###851 with secondary appointments in the Biology and Political Science departments.
###857 He completed his dissertation at the Johns Hopkins University on a Philosophical Analysis
###861 of Microeconomic Laws.
###864 In addition to nearly 40 articles or chapters, he is author of more than a dozen books,
###868 some of which had been translated into multiple languages.
###871 Dr. Rosenberg has been a visiting professor and fellow of the Center for the Philosophy
###877 of Science, University of Minnesota, as well as the department ... as well as the
###883 University of California Santa Cruz and Oxford University,
###887 and a visiting fellow of the Philosophy Department at the Research School of Social Science of
###891 the Australian National University. That's a long sentence.
###894 (Audience laughing)
###895 He has held fellowships from the National Science Foundation,
###898 the American Council of Learned Societies, and a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation.
###903 In 1993, Dr. Rosenberg received the Lakatos Award in the Philosophy of Science.
###908 In 2006 and in 2007, he held a fellowship at the National Humanity Center.
###913 He was also the Phi Beta Kappa-Romanell Lecturer for the 2006-2007 year.
###920 On one website listing, the world's 50 most famous atheists in the world, Dr. Rosenberg
###926 ranks number 13. His recent book is The Atheist's Guide to
###932 Reality: Enjoying Life without Illusions. Please welcome with me, Dr. Alex Rosenberg.
###948 (Audience clapping)
###954 Mr. Miller: The debate rules for tonight ... the structure of the debate will be as follows:
###967 Each speaker will have a 20-minute opening statement,
###970 followed by two 12-minute rebuttals and then two eight-minute rebuttals.
###975 The speakers will then provide a five-minute closing statement.
###978 Now, all the actual debate should take 90 minutes,
###981 45 minutes for each position to make their case.
###985 There will then be a 30- to 45-minute Q&A period according to which we will take questions
###990 from our live audience here at Purdue and from our live streaming audience across the
###995 world perhaps.
###997 If either of the debaters goes over their allotted time,
###1000 we will give them a 15-second grace period ... we're very graceful ... gracious ...
###1004 and then promptly ask them to terminate their time and we will have a modest interaction
###1010 between the professors in order to get a response to maybe answers that they give to you.
###1018 Professor Craig will approach the lectern first.
###1022 Dr. Craig ... and then when he begins, the time begins. Timer, are you ready? Begin.
###1033 Dr. Craig: Good evening, I'm delighted to be able to participate in tonight's debate
###1039 and I count it a real privilege to be discussing this important issue with Dr. Rosenberg.
###1046 Tonight, we're interested in discussing some of the arguments that make belief in God reasonable
###1053 or unreasonable. So, in my opening speech, I'm going to present
###1057 several arguments, which I think make it reasonable to believe that God exists.
###1064 In my second speech, I will respond to Dr. Rosenberg's arguments against the reasonable
###1070 disbelief in God. I believe that God's existence best explains
###1076 a wide range of the data of human experience. Let me just mention eight.
###1083 First, God is the best explanation of why anything at all exists.
###1089 Suppose you were hiking through the forest and came upon a ball lying on the ground.
###1095 You would naturally wonder how it came to be there.
###1098 If your hiking buddy said to you, "Just forget about it, it just exists," inexplicably.
###1104 You would think either that he was joking or that he wanted you to just keep moving.
###1109 No one would take seriously the idea that the ball just exists without any explanation.
###1116 Now, notice that merely increasing the size of the ball even until it becomes coextensive
###1123 with the universe does nothing to provide or remove the need for an explanation of its
###1132 existence.
###1133 So, what is the explanation of the existence of the universe?
###1137 Whereby, the universe, I mean all of space-time reality,
###1143 the explanation of the universe can lie only in a transcendent reality;
###1149 beyond the universe, beyond space and time, which is metaphysically necessary in its existence.
###1156 Now, there's only one way I can think of to get a contingent universe from a necessarily
###1162 existing cause, and that is if the cause is a personal agent
###1168 who can freely choose to create a contingent reality.
###1174 It therefore follows that the best explanation of the existence of the contingent universe
###1179 is a transcendent personal being, which is what everybody means by "God".
###1187 We can summarize this reasoning as follows:
###1190 One, every contingent thing has an explanation of its existence.
###1195 Two, if the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is a transcendent
###1201 personal being. Three, the universe is a contingent thing.
###1207 Four, therefore the universe has an explanation of its existence.
###1212 Five, therefore the explanation of the universe is a transcendent personal being; which is
###1219 what everybody means by "God".
###1222 Second, God is the best explanation of the origin of the universe.
###1229 We have pretty strong evidence that the universe is not eternal in the past but had an absolute
###1235 beginning a finite time ago. In 2003, Arvind Borde, Alan Guth, and Alexander
###1242 Vilenkin were able to prove that any universe which has on average been in a state of cosmic
###1249 expansion, cannot be infinite in the past, but must have
###1254 a past space time boundary.
###1257 What makes their proof so powerful is that it holds regardless of the physical description
###1263 of the very early universe. Because we don't yet have a quantum theory
###1267 of gravity, we can't yet provide a physical description of the first split second of the
###1274 universe, but the Borde-Guth Vilenkin theorem is independent
###1280 of any physical description of that moment.
###1283 Their theorem implies that the quantum vacuum state, which may have characterized the early
###1289 universe; cannot be eternal in the past but must have
###1293 had an absolute beginning. Even if our universe is just a tiny part of
###1299 a so-called multiverse composed of many universes, their theorem requires that the multiverse
###1306 itself must have had an absolute beginning.
###1311 Of course, highly speculative scenarios, such as loop quantum gravity models, string models,
###1317 and even closed time-like curves had been proposed to try to avoid this absolute
###1324 beginning. These models are fraught with problems, but
###1329 the bottom line is that none of these models, even if true,succeed in restoring an eternal
###1337 past. Last spring, at a conference in Cambridge
###1341 celebrating the 70th birthday of Stephen Hawking, Vilenkin delivered a paper entitled; Did the
###1348 Universe Have a Beginning?, which surveyed the current cosmology with
###1353 respect to that question.
###1355 He argued and I quote "None of these scenarios can actually be past-eternal."
###1362 He concluded, "All the evidence we have says that the universe had a beginning."
###1368 But then the inevitable question arises, why did the universe come into being?
###1375 What brought the universe into existence? There must have been a transcendent cause
###1382 which brought the universe into being.
###1385 We can summarize our argument thus far as follows:
###1388 One, the universe began to exist. Two, if the universe began to exist, then
###1395 the universe has a transcendent cause. Three, therefore the universe has a transcendent
###1403 cause.
###1405 By the very nature of the case, that cause must be a transcendent immaterial being.
###1414 There are only two possible things that could fit that description,
###1418 either an abstract object like a number or an unembodied mind or consciousness,
###1427 but abstract objects don't stand in causal relations.
###1432 The number seven for example has no effect on anything.
###1435 Therefore, the cause of the universe is plausibly an unembodied mind or person.
###1442 Thus we are brought not merely to a transcendent cause of the universe, but to its personal
###1448 creator.
###1450 Three, God is the best explanation of the applicability of mathematics to the physical
###1457 world. Philosophers and scientists have puzzled over
###1461 what physicists Eugene Wigner called "The uncanny effectiveness of mathematics."
###1469 How is it that a mathematical theorist like Peter Higgs, can sit down at his desk and
###1475 by pouring over mathematical equations, predict the existence of a fundamental particle
###1482 which experimentalists 30 years later after investing millions of dollars and thousands
###1489 of man hours are finally able to detect. Mathematics is the language of nature, but
###1498 how is this to be explained? If mathematical objects are abstract entities
###1504 causally isolated from the universe, then the applicability of mathematics is in
###1509 the words of philosopher of mathematics Penelope Maddy, "A happy coincidence."
###1515 On the other hand,if mathematical objects are just useful fictions,
###1519 how is it that nature is written in the language of these fictions?
###1524 In his book, Dr. Rosenberg emphasizes that naturalism doesn't tolerate cosmic coincidences,
###1532 but the naturalist has no explanation of the uncanny applicability of mathematics to the
###1538 physical world.
###1540 By contrast, the theist has a ready explanation. When God created the physical universe, he
###1546 designed it on the mathematical structure he had in mind.
###1551 We can summarize this argument as follows: One, if God did not exist the applicability
###1557 of mathematics would be a happy coincidence. Two, the applicability of mathematics is not
###1564 a happy coincidence. Three, therefore God exists.
###1570 Fourth, God is the best explanation of the fine-tuning of the universe for intelligent
###1577 life.
###1579 In recent decades, scientists have been stunned by the discovery that the initial conditions
###1584 of the big bang were fine tuned for the existence of intelligent
###1588 life with a precision and delicacy that literally defy human comprehension.
###1595 There are three live explanatory options for this extraordinary fine tuning;
###1603 a physical necessity, chance, or design. Physical necessity is not, however, a plausible
###1613 explanation because the finely-tuned constants and quantities are independent of the laws
###1619 of nature. Therefore they are not physically necessary.
###1623 Could the fine-tuning be due to chance? The problem with this explanation is that
###1629 the odds of a life-permitting universe governed by our laws of nature are just so infinitesimal
###1636 that they cannot be reasonably faced. Therefore the proponents of chance have been
###1641 forced to postulate the existence of a world ensemble of other universes,
###1648 preferably infinite in number and randomly ordered,
###1652 so that life permitting universes would appear by chance somewhere in the ensemble.
###1659 Not only is this hypothesis to borrow Richard Dawkins' phrase, "An unparsimonious extravagance",
###1666 but it faces an insuperable objection. By far, most of the observable universes in
###1673 a world ensemble would be worlds in which a single brain
###1678 fluctuates into existence out of the vacuum and observes its otherwise empty world.
###1685 Thus, if our world were just a random member of a world ensemble, we ought to be having
###1691 observations like that. Since we don't, that's strongly disconfirms
###1696 the world ensemble hypothesis, so chance is also not a good explanation.
###1704 It follows that design is the best explanation of the fine-tuning of the universe.
###1710 Thus, the fine-tuning of the universe constitutes evidence for a cosmic designer.
###1717 Fifth, God is the best explanation of intentional states of consciousness in the world.
###1725 Philosophers are puzzled by states of intentionality. Intentionality is the property of being about
###1733 something or of something. It signifies the object directedness of our
###1739 thoughts. For example, I can think about my summer vacation
###1744 or I can think of my wife.
###1747 No physical object has this sort of intentionality. A chair, or a stone, or a glob of tissue like
###1755 the brain is not about or of something else. Only mental states or states of consciousness
###1763 are about other things. As a materialist, Dr. Rosenberg recognizes
###1769 this fact and so concludes that on atheism, there really are no intentional states.
###1777 Dr. Rosenberg boldly claims that we never really think about anything, but this seems
###1785 incredible.
###1786 Obviously, I am thinking about Dr. Rosenberg's argument.
###1791 This seems to me to be a reductio ad absurdum of atheism.
###1796 By contrast on theism, because God is a mind, it's hardly surprising that there should be
###1803 finite minds. Thus, intentional states fit comfortably into
###1809 a theistic world view. So, we may argue,
###1813 One, if God did not exist, intentional states of consciousness would not exist.
###1820 Two, but intentional states of consciousness do exist.
###1824 Three, therefore God exists.
###1830 Number six, God is the best explanation of objective moral values and duties in the world.
###1838 In moral experience, we apprehend moral values and duties which impose themselves as objectively
###1845 binding and true. For example, we all recognize that it's wrong
###1851 to walk into an elementary school with an automatic weapon and to shoot little boys
###1858 and girls and their teachers.
###1862 On a naturalistic view, however, there's nothing really wrong with this.
###1868 Moral values are just a subjective byproduct of biological evolution and social conditioning.
###1875 Dr. Rosenberg is brutally honest about the implications of his atheism.
###1881 He writes, "There is no such thing as morally right or wrong. Individual human life is meaningless
###1889 and without ultimate moral value. We need to face the fact that nihilism is true".
###1897 By contrast, the theist grounds objective moral values in God and our moral duties in
###1905 his commands. The theist thus has the explanatory resources
###1911 which the atheist lacks to ground objective moral values and duties.
###1917 Hence we may argue, One, objective moral values and duties exist.
###1922 Two, but if God did not exist, objective moral values and duties would not exist.
###1928 From which it follows, Three, therefore God exists.
###1933 Number seven, God is the best explanation of the historical facts about Jesus of Nazareth.
###1941 Historians have reached something of a consensus that Jesus came on the scene with an unprecedented
###1947 sense of divine authority, the authority to stand and speak in God's place.
###1954 He claimed that in himself the Kingdom of God had come.
###1957 As visible demonstrations of this fact, he carried out a ministry of miracle working
###1964 and exorcisms, but the supreme confirmation of his claim was his resurrection from the
###1970 dead.
###1971 If Jesus did rise from the dead; then it would seem that we have a divine miracle on our
###1977 hands, and thus evidence for the existence of God.
###1983 I realize that most people probably think that the resurrection of Jesus is something
###1987 you just accept by faith or not, but there are actually three facts recognized
###1994 by the majority of historians today which I believe are best explained by the resurrection
###2000 of Jesus.
###2002 Fact number one, on the Sunday after his crucifixion, Jesus' tomb was found empty by a group of
###2009 his women followers. Two, on separate occasions, different individuals
###2015 and groups of people saw appearances of Jesus alive after his death.
###2022 And three, the original disciples suddenly came to believe in the resurrection of Jesus
###2028 despite having every predisposition to the contrary.
###2033 The eminent British scholar, N.T. Wright, near the end of his 800-page study of the
###2039 historicity of Jesus' resurrection concludes that
###2043 the empty tomb and post mortem appearances of Jesus have been established to such a high
###2049 degree of historical probability as to be and I quote
###2052 "virtually certain" akin to the death of Caesar Augustus in AD 17 or the fall of Jerusalem
###2061 in AD 70.
###2064 Naturalistic attempts to explain away these three great facts like the disciples stole
###2069 the body or Jesus wasn't really dead have been universally rejected by contemporary
###2075 scholarship. The simple fact is that there just is no plausible
###2080 naturalistic explanation of these facts. Therefore, it seems to me the Christian is
###2085 amply justified in believing that Jesus rose from the dead and was who he claimed to be,
###2093 but that entails that God exists. Thus we have a good inductive argument to
###2099 the existence of God based on the facts concerning the resurrection of Jesus.
###2105 Finally, number eight, God can be personally known and experienced.
###2112 This isn't really an argument for God's existence, rather it's the claim that you can know that
###2118 God exists wholly apart from arguments simply by personally experiencing Him.
###2124 Philosophers call beliefs likes this "Properly basic beliefs."
###2129 They are based on some other beliefs rather they're part of the foundations of a person's
###2134 system of beliefs.
###2136 Other properly basic beliefs would be belief in the reality of the past or the existence
###2142 of the external world. In the same way, belief in God is for those
###2147 who seek him a properly basic belief grounded in our experience of God.
###2154 If this is so, then there's a danger that arguments for God could actually distract
###2160 our attention from God Himself. The Bible promises, "Draw near to God and
###2167 He will draw near to you." We must not so concentrate on the external
###2173 proofs that we fail to hear the inner voice of God speaking to our own hearts.
###2179 For those who listen, God becomes a personal reality in their lives.
###2185 In summary then, we've seen eight respects in which God provides a better explanation
###2191 of the world than naturalism. God is the best explanation of why anything
###2195 at all exists. God is the best explanation of the origin
###2199 of the universe. God is the best explanation of the applicability
###2203 of mathematics to the physical world. God is the best explanation of the fine-tuning
###2208 of the universe for intelligent life. God is the best explanation of intentional
###2213 states of consciousness in the world. God is the best explanation of objective moral
###2218 values and duties in the world. God is the best explanation of the historical
###2223 facts concerning Jesus resurrection. Finally, God can be personally known and experienced.
###2230 For all of these reasons, I think that belief in God is eminently reasonable.
###2236 If Dr. Rosenberg is to persuade this otherwise, he must first tear down all eight of the reasons
###2242 that I've presented and then in their place erect a case of his
###2245 own to show why belief in God is unreasonable. Unless and until he does that, I think we
###2252 should agree that it is reasonable to believe in God.
###2258 (Audience clapping).
###2263 Mr. Miller: Do we have a timer on this side or is it just ... okay, that ends Dr. Craig's
###2277 opening statement. Dr. Rosenberg will now approach his lectern.
###2282 And, when I say begin then Professor Rosenberg may begin his 20-minute opening statement.
###2288 Timer, are you ready? Dr. Rosenberg you may begin.
###2292 Dr. Rosenberg: Thanks Corey and thank you for the invitation.
###2297 As Yogi Berra of the famous Yankee catcher, once said, "I appreciate you're making this
###2302 night necessary." I don't know whether to laugh or to cry.
###2308 I hope you didn't pay money to come to tonight's debate because everything that Dr. Craig said
###2313 ... almost everything actually, he said many times before in many different debates, almost
###2320 in the same order, and all of them available on the internet.
###2325 So, you know you didn't need to come out in this really cold night here in West Lafayette
###2331 to hear these debates again and to hear these arguments again.
###2335 In particular, what's remarkable about them is how impervious they are to the previous
###2340 discussions and criticism that they've been exposed to.
###2344 They're exactly the same as seven or eight or nine internet presentations of his arguments
###2352 in the past. What it leads me to ask is, is Dr. Craig infallible
###2357 or does he just not listen?
###2359 Probably, the latter. He probably doesn't listen to what his interlocutors have suggested.
###2367 I don't think that he listens because he's really not interested in getting at the truth.
###2371 He's interested in scoring debate points. The two moves that Dr. Craig almost always
###2377 makes, first, there's the burden of proof claim.
###2383 As though we were in a court of law, as though it was a question of the defending attorney
###2388 and the prosecuting attorney engaged in an adversarial procedure.
###2393 And the other thing that you often hear is, "All I need to show to win is ..." so for
###2398 example at the very end of his remarks he said, "I've got eight arguments and he's got
###2402 to refute all eight of them or else I win". You know, philosophy and theology don't proceed
###2408 by a "court room style" debate. We're engaged in a cooperative search for
###2413 the truth, both theists and atheists, not on adversarial contest for victory.
###2420 This is the wrong format for a profitable discussion of faith, or God, or science and
###2427 reason. But, let's turn to the substance of the matter.
###2433 Our topic is whether faith in God is reasonable, but of course by definition faith is a belief
###2439 in the absence of evidence. So, I'm going to give Dr. Craig the benefit
###2444 of the doubt and accept the change that he has made in the terms of the debate.
###2450 It now turns out that what we're arguing about is whether belief in God is reasonable.
###2454 The god we're talking about is the god of the Abrahamic religions; the god of Islam,
###2459 of Christianity, and Judaism. It's not the "milk and water" deism of for
###2464 example the founding fathers, Jefferson, Adams, Monroe perhaps even George Washington.
###2470 The god we're talking about has the following features.
###2473 If he exists, he's got the three "omni's" and benevolence.
###2476 He's got omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, and an unqualifiedly goodwill.
###2483 If these four features are incompatible with some obvious fact, then of course the atheist's
###2490 ... the theist's god is non-existent. Can I ask some water, Corey?
###2497 So, let's be clear that we're arguing about theism here.
###2504 In thinking about theism and in thinking about science ... thank you Corey ... there's something
###2512 else that we had better keep in mind. Dr. Craig is very confident about his take
###2519 on fundamental physics, on important and controversial questions about which physicists have not
###2527 attain consensus.
###2529 The important thing to bear in mind in thinking about his take, the sides he chose, and the
###2534 confidence with which he presents his take, the important thing to bear in mind is this;
###2540 there are 2,000 members of the National Academy of Sciences.
###2543 The most important body of the most distinguished scientists in the United States of which four
###2548 are faculty here at Purdue and two ... the two Nobel Prize winners in chemistry of course
###2553 are both members of the National Academy of Science.
###2556 Of these 2,000 people, 95% of them are atheists. The percentage for the physicists is even
###2562 higher. What do these people know about physics that
###2566 Dr. Craig doesn't know? Is it a coincidence that this number of the
###2570 members of the National Academy of Science are unbelievers?
###2575 I think it isn't and I think it requires us to take with a certain lack of confidence,
###2582 the claims that Dr. Craig makes about science.
###2586 I'm going to controvert some of those claims right now.
###2589 In particular, many of the arguments that Dr. Craig gave tonight, and which he has given
###2593 repeatedly in the past, rest on the first cause argument;
###2598 an argument that goes back certainly to St. Thomas Aquinas and probably to Aristotle.
###2606 It rests on, of course, the principle of sufficient reason; the principle that everything that
###2612 exists must have a cause.
###2615 The remarkable thing about this argument and the Principle of Sufficient Reason as it's
###2620 called on which address is that the principle is plainly false.
###2625 It's refuted trillions of times every second throughout the universe.
###2630 It's refuted in this room and I'll give you a pretty full explanation of why.
###2635 Take two Uranium 238 atoms, okay, that are absolutely indistinguishable.
###2641 In a given moment, these two indistinguishable atoms, atoms of exactly the same mass and
###2647 energy state have the following difference. One produces an alpha particle spontaneously
###2652 and the other doesn't. There is no cause whatsoever for that difference.
###2658 That's what quantum mechanics tells us. Suddenly one emits an alpha particle and the
###2663 other doesn't. There's no cause or whatever for that difference
###2666 between them.
###2667 Now, you might think that that's not a very important fact of nature but one mole, one
###2673 Avogadro's number of Uranium 238 molecules, emits three million alpha particles a second.
###2684 Every helium atom on this planet is one of those alpha particles.
###2689 The smoke detectors that operate all through this auditorium to protect us from fires,
###2696 those operate because of the indeterminate, unexplained, completely spontaneous appearance
###2704 of an alpha particle out of a uranium atom in these systems.
###2709 For Dr. Craig to insist on the arguments that rest on the claim, that every event had a
###2718 cause that had to have brought it into being is just bluff.
###2724 Right, it's not a principle accepted in physics. You can't argue from it, forward for ... from
###2730 its intuitive attractiveness. Let's consider the fine-tuning argument, another
###2738 of the claims about science that Dr. Craig makes.
###2742 This is the argument that the charge on the electron, the gravitational constant, the
###2746 mass of the electron, Planck's constant, the Hubble constant, the cosmic density parameter
###2752 that they're all so beautifully arranged to make human life actual that there must have
###2759 been some purpose or design that brought them into being in order to do that.
###2764 That's the best explanation.
###2766 To begin with, this is terrible carbon chauvinism. If these constants had been slightly different,
###2772 maybe there would be intelligent life in the universe that's germanium-based or silicon-based.
###2778 Look at the periodic table of the elements. Look at the atoms around carbon in the periodic
###2784 table. Ask yourself whether, if some of these constants
###2787 had been slightly different whether there might not be intelligent creatures in the
###2792 universe that are differently composed from us.
###2795 More important, physics ruled out the kind of teleology, the kind of purpose of thinking
###2800 that Dr. Craig invokes here, 400 years ago. If it's one thing that physics is not going
###2807 to go back to and turn around and accept in its search for the fundamental nature of reality,
###2814 it's the invocation of purposes.
###2817 There are of course in physical theory at least two different ways in which the particular
###2823 way in which the constants of our part of the universe could have come in to existence,
###2830 while they're being in a definitely large number of other combinations of constants,
###2835 making up other inaccessible regions either of this universe or of other universes.
###2841 The inflationary period soon after the big bang produced regions of space by completely
###2849 quantum mechanical indeterministic symmetry breaking which are inaccessible to us; which
###2855 are beyond our horizon, our event horizon. There are possibly indefinitely many of these.
###2866 For all we know, there may be life or there may not be life in them.
###2869 Then of course string theory and end theory tell us that there are minimally 10 to the
###2877 500th different kinds of possible universes or actual universes bubbling up out of the
###2884 quantum foam of the eternally existing, multi-universe.
###2892 I'm not going to take sides on these varying theories, but I defy Professor Craig to argue
###2897 from authority that it is impossible for something to have been created from nothing.
###2904 The symmetry breaking which is characteristic of the cascade of events that occurred in
###2909 our universe and which produces our universe in addition to the indefinitely many other
###2917 universes bubbling up out of the quantum foam of the multiverse.
###2920 That symmetry breaking is another example of the violation of the principle of sufficient
###2925 reason on which Dr. Craig's stakes so many of his arguments.
###2930 Let's turn to something much more accessible, objective values.
###2933 Now, Dr. Craig's argument that only God can underwrite objective values was refuted by
###2940 Plato in 390 B.C., in an argument that he gives in the first and simplest of his dialogues
###2948 the Euthyphro.
###2949 I'm very tempted to say to Dr. Craig, "What part of 'No Euthyphro' don't you understand?"
###2955 The question that Plato raises in the Euthyphro goes like this, "Take your favorite moral
###2960 norm; gay marriage is forbidden, or FGM is required, or thou shall not kill.
###2966 Take your favorite moral norm. Ask yourself this question.
###2970 Is it morally right because God chose it or did God choose it because it's morally right?"
###2976 We all know the answer to this question. The answer to this question is God chose it
###2980 because it's morally right. What that means of course is the moral rightness
###2985 of thou shall not kill is entirely independent fact from God's choosing it, it's because
###2991 he recognizes the moral rightness of "Thou shall not kill" that he imposed it on us.
###2999 That means that the mere fact that it's God who imposed it on us, doesn't explain the
###3004 nature of objective value.
###3005 It's that further fact that he was wise enough and smart enough to detect about "Thou shall
###3011 not kill" that made it the morally right value for us.
###3016 Okay and this is the point that Socrates makes to Euthyphro in the first and simplest of
###3022 the dialogues. And it is a problem that theological ethics
###3032 has wrestled with ever since. The only option in responding to this argument
###3038 is the divine command theory; a theory that has had its exponents all the way back to
###3044 William of Ockham.
###3045 The trouble with divine command theory is that in order to articulate that theory, in
###3051 order to defend it, in order to make it sound plausible; you have to already commit yourself
###3057 to there being some normative fact, some moral fact about the moral rules that make them
###3063 right independent of God's saying, "You do it or you go to hell".
###3068 There's a rightness about moral norms that cannot be exhausted by the mere fact that
###3074 it was handed down on a mountain by Moses from God.
###3080 Natural selection is a theory of course about how we came to be moral, why we're moral about
###3088 what the ecological conditions are that made us moral.
###3092 It explains our morality, but it doesn't necessarily explain away our morality.
###3098 That requires something else. The suggestion that without God, the naturalist,
###3105 the Darwinian has no basis on which to underwrite his normative commitment that again is bluff.
###3114 And in fact, it's the person who claims that it's God that gave normative morality to us,
###3124 that explains its normative rightness is the person who has regrettably to use the expression
###3132 that Dr. Craig so invokes the burden of proof of explaining.
###3136 What is it about God that makes for the moral rightness of the ethical norms that he imposes
###3144 on us?
###3146 There are of course any numbers of alternative ethical theories that underwrite the objectivity
###3153 of ethics; among them, utilitarianism and social contract theory, and ideal observer
###3159 theory, and Hume's theory of the sympathies and the Kantian theory of the categorical
###3164 imperative. And the real problem for Dr. Craig is he needs
###3168 to refute each of these normative theories in order to show that there's no other basis
###3173 for ethics than God. The resources that he would use to cast doubt
###3180 on these theories also cast out on the divine command theory.
###3187 So, let's turn to the argument from the New Testament.
###3193 I am sort of gob-smacked as a philosopher that he should persist in propounding this
###3199 preposterous argument. Ask yourself the following question, in 1827
###3205 Joseph Smith got 11 people to certify that they observe the golden tablets which he,
###3213 an illiterate person, was able to translate from reformed Egyptian and convey the Book
###3225 of Mormon to the Mormon ... to the Latter Day Saints.
###3231 Do we believe on the basis of those 11 certificates that are only about 160 years old that the
###3240 Book of Mormon is the revealed word of God? The Koran tells us that Muhammad ascended
###3247 to heaven from the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem on the 26th of February
###3256 621. And there are millions and millions of Muslims
###3259 all over the world who are committed to that great truth.
###3264 Do you think we in this room should believe it? Right.
###3268 Scientology that claims eight million adherents throughout the world, Scientology tells us
###3274 that 75 million years ago somebody named Xenu brought billions of people to earth on spaceships
###3283 that looked like DC8s. And who are we to believe that there are 55,000
###3288 people in the United States or eight million people around the world who really believe
###3292 this too? Is there any reason why we should accept the certification of L.
###3297 Ron Hubbard and the Church of Scientology that this actually happened? No, of course
###3304 not.
###3304 How many of you are familiar with the statues of Madonna taken out from their churches once
###3309 a year which shed tears? Of course as scientist we know exactly what the physical properties
###3316 are of these statues and how the rapid and sudden change of temperature between the inside
###3321 and the outside of the cathedral produces condensation, which the devout believed to
###3326 be tears, but that's no reason for us to believe it.
###3329 Think about this, 53 of the first 62 DNA exonerations of people who turned out to be innocent of
###3338 charges of capital crimes in the United States, 53 of these people were committed, convicted
###3344 on eye witness testimony. We know from cognitive social science how
###3351 unreliable eye witness testimony is today. Why should we suppose the eye witness testimony
###3358 from 33 A.D. is any more reliable?
###3362 This as an argument for God's existence seems to me to be bizarre.
###3367 Of course the killer argument for... against God's existence is the argument from
###3372 evil. It's enough to show that theism is unreasonable
###3377 and it of course is the principle reason for apostasy from the Christian faith and the
###3382 Jewish faith and Islam, all through the centuries.
###3385 And the argument is simple and terrible and it goes like this: One, if the theist God
###3391 exists, he's omnipotent and benevolent. A benevolent creature eliminates suffering
###3398 to the extent that the benevolent creature can.
###3402 Therefore, if there's a god and he's omnipotent and benevolent, he eliminates all suffering,
###3408 but as we know it's obvious that there's plenty of suffering in the world both man-made and
###3414 natural suffering.
###3416 If there's a god then he is either not omnipotent, or not benevolent, or not either omnipotent
###3424 or benevolent and theism is false. The problem of evil is theism's problem from
###3430 hell. I want to say one last thing about the problem
###3434 of evil and about the potential responses that Dr. Craig will make and that he has made
###3439 in the past. And I need to make something about my own
###3442 personal history clear here.
###3444 There are a lot of responses to the problem of evil that I find morally offensive.
###3449 I find them morally offensive for a certain reason.
###3452 I'm the child of holocaust survivors. All of my family, except my parents, were
###3457 killed by the Nazis, including two half brothers of mine.
###3462 Okay?
###3463 I will not take kindly, okay, to a suggestion that Dr. Craig has made repeatedly in debate
###3470 for or like this, that the innocent children who died in the holocaust including, or died
###3476 in the hands of Israeli ... of the children ...
###3478 of the soldiers of Israel in Canaan; that these innocent children like my half brothers
###3485 were more fortunate, more luckier because they ascended to heaven directly than the
###3491 SS soldiers who killed them and lived very nice, very comfortable, very long lives in
###3496 West Germany after World War II.
###3499 I'm not going to take kindly to that kind of exculpation of theism.
###3506 In particular, Dr. Craig has said before, and said in one sentence at least tonight;
###3511 that nobody has ever shown the incompatibility of theism and suffering that it's part of
###3519 divine plan that's beyond our cognizance. Well, the argument that I sketched, the argument
###3525 from the evil is a logical deduction which shows the incompatibility of an omnipotent
###3531 and benevolent creature with suffering on this planet.
###3536 And it's not enough to "fob it off" on the mystery of God's plan or on the mere logical
###3547 compatibility of these two views. Now, I've got to stop and in the reply I'm
###3552 going to want to take up the two new arguments that Dr. Craig introduced; the argument from
###3557 mathematics and the argument from intentionality, but I think I put enough on the table for
###3563 him to rejoin. Thank you.
###3568 (Audience clapping)
###3571 Dr. Miller: All right Dr. Craig will now begin his 12-minute rebuttal.
###3581 Timer, go ahead and begin when he begins to speak.
###3586 Dr. Craig: I noticed that in Dr. Rosenberg's opening speech, he didn't really present many
###3595 arguments against the reasonableness of belief in God.
###3599 He gestured in the direction of the problem of evil, but he didn't really develop it.
###3604 The problem is that argument is based upon controversial premises such as that if God
###3609 is all powerful, he can just create any world that He wants and that If God is all good,
###3615 he would want to create a world without evil. And neither one of those is necessarily true
###3620 and that is why among philosophers even atheists, the logical version of the problem of evil
###3625 is widely rejected.
###3626 So, what Dr. Rosenberg needs to show, is that it is impossible that God could have morally
###3632 sufficient reasons for permitting the suffering in the world and until he does that he hasn't
###3637 even begun to offer a problem of evil that disproves theism.
###3642 Rather when you read Dr. Rosenberg's work, what you discover is that his skepticism about
###3647 God's existence is really rooted in his scientism or naturalism, which make it unreasonable
###3653 to believe in God.
###3655 But here I think it's absolutely crucial that we distinguish between two types of naturalism
###3661 that Dr. Rosenberg tends to blur together, epistemological naturalism which says that
###3667 science is the only source of knowledge and metaphysical naturalism, which says that only
###3673 physical things exist. Let me say a word about each one of these.
###3678 First, with respect to epistemological naturalism, I want to make two points.
###3684 First, it's a false theory of knowledge for two reasons.
###3688 First, it's overly restrictive. There are truths that cannot be proven by
###3694 natural science and the success of natural science in discovering truths about the physical
###3700 world does nothing to show that it's the only source of knowledge and truth.
###3706 Secondly, it's self refuting. The statement, natural science is the only
###3712 source of knowledge, is not itself a scientific statement.
###3717 Therefore it cannot be true. For these two reasons, epistemological naturalism
###3722 is a false theory of knowledge that is widely rejected by philosophers but leave that point
###3729 aside. The really important point for tonight's debate
###3732 is the second.
###3733 That epistemological naturalism does not imply metaphysical naturalism.
###3739 A case in point would be Willard Quine, the most famous epistemological naturalist of
###3744 the 20th century. Quine showed himself to be commendably open
###3749 to the reality of non-physical entities. He wrote, "If I saw indirect explanatory benefit
###3756 in positing, possibilia, spirits, a Creator, I would joyfully accord them scientific status
###3764 too on a par with such avowedly scientific posits as quarks and black holes."
###3772 And in fact, Quine was as good as his word, for he did posit the existence of immaterial,
###3778 non-physical objects namely mathematical objects like sets.
###3784 Quine's case shows that the epistemological naturalist need not be a metaphysical naturalist;
###3792 but secondly my arguments for the existence of God.
###3795 Many of my arguments do just what Quine said. They show on the basis of scientific evidence
###3801 the explanatory benefit of positing God. And so, they are acceptable to the epistemological
###3810 naturalist.
###3810 The epistemological naturalist can and I think should be a theist.
###3816 The real issue in the debate tonight is not epistemological but metaphysical naturalism.
###3822 Dr. Rosenberg hasn't given us any reason to think that metaphysical naturalism is true.
###3829 So, what can we say about metaphysical naturalism? Again I want to make two points.
###3834 First, my arguments for the existence of God showed that metaphysical naturalism is not
###3840 true. There is a personal transcendent reality beyond
###3845 the physical universe; but secondly I think that metaphysical naturalism is so contrary
###3852 to reason and experience as to be absurd. And in the following arguments, the first
###3858 premise in every case is taken from Dr. Rosenberg's own book, so first the argument from intentionality.
###3868 According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is true; I cannot think about anything, that's
###3875 because there are no intentional states, but two, I am thinking about naturalism from which
###3882 it follows three, therefore naturalism is not true.
###3886 So, if you think that you ever think about anything you should conclude that naturalism
###3892 is false.
###3894 Second, the argument from meaning. According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is
###3899 true, no sentence has any meaning. He says that all the book...
###3905 sentences in his own book are in fact meaningless, but premise two, premise one has meaning.
###3913 We all understood it. Therefore it follows that three, naturalism
###3917 is not true.
###3921 Third, argument from truth. According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is
###3928 true; there are no true sentences and that's because they're all meaningless, but two,
###3934 premise one is true, that's what the naturalist believes and asserts, from which it follows
###3940 three, therefore naturalism is not true.
###3944 Fourth the argument from moral praise and blame.
###3949 According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is true, then I am not morally praise worthy
###3954 or blame worthy for any of my actions, because as I said on his view, objective moral values
###3960 and duties do not exist, but two, I am morally praise worthy and blame worthy for at least
###3966 some of my actions. If you think that you've ever done something
###3970 truly wrong or truly good, then you should conclude that three, therefore naturalism
###3977 is not true.
###3978 Fifth, the argument from freedom. According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is
###3984 true, I do not do anything freely, everything is determined; but two, I can freely agree
###3991 or disagree with premise one, from which it follows three, therefore naturalism is not
###3999 true.
###4000 Sixth, the argument from purpose. According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is
###4006 true, I do not plan to do anything; but two, I planned to come to tonight's debate, that's
###4015 why I'm here, from which it follows three, therefore naturalism is not true.
###4021 Seventh, the argument from enduring. According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is
###4027 true, I do not endure for two moments of time but, two, I have been sitting here for more
###4035 than a minute. If you think that you're the same person who
###4038 walked into the room tonight then you should agree that three, therefore naturalism is
###4044 not true.
###4045 Finally, the argument from personal existence. This is perhaps the "coup de gras" against
###4051 naturalism. According to Dr. Rosenberg, if naturalism
###4054 is true, I do not exist. He says, there are no selves, there are no
###4060 persons, no first person perspectives; but two, I do exist.
###4065 I know this, as certainly as I know anything from which it follows, therefore that naturalism
###4071 is not true.
###4073 In a word, metaphysical naturalism is "absurd". Notice that my argument is not that it is
###4080 "unappealing" rather it is that metaphysical naturalism flies in the face of reason and
###4086 experience and is therefore untenable. So, in sum, epistemological naturalism is
###4092 consistent with theism and metaphysical naturalism is absurd.
###4098 Let's now return to those arguments that I offered for God's existence and see how Dr.
###4103 Rosenberg responded to some of them.
###4105 He didn't respond to the first argument why anything exists rather than nothing.
###4111 As for the origin of the universe, he says, "But not everything has a cause.
###4116 In quantum mechanics, virtual particles come to be without a cause." Notice that he misstates
###4122 the first premise, which is that the universe began to exist.
###4126 Then the second, if the universe began to exist, the universe has a transcendent cause,
###4132 that's because the universe can't come into being out of nothing and virtual particles
###4136 don't come out of nothing. They come out of the quantum vacuum which
###4140 is a sea of roiling energy.
###4143 Moreover in quantum mechanics, it's not clear that these entities are in fact uncaused.
###4149 There are deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics according to which the behavior
###4154 of these particles is fully determined. Finally number three, I would say in response
###4160 to this, that on the origin of the universe, you have to believe the entire universe could
###4167 come into being from non-being in order for it to come to exist without a cause.
###4172 I think that takes more faith than belief in the existence of God.
###4177 He didn't reply to the argument about the applicability of mathematics in the world.
###4181 As for the fine-tuning argument, he simply appealed here once again to the multiverse
###4186 hypothesis, but I refuted that in my opening speech.
###4190 If we were just a random member of a multiversal world ensemble; then we ought to be having
###4195 totally different observations than the ones that we in fact have.
###4200 Therefore that's why physicist like Roger Penrose, have concluded that multiverse hypotheses
###4206 are impotent to explain the fine-tuning of the universe.
###4211 He says perhaps you could have another basis for life, like silicon.
###4214 What he doesn't appreciate is that in the absence of fine-tuning there wouldn't even
###4218 be matter, there wouldn't even be chemistry, much less stars and planets where life might
###4225 evolve. I don't think he really understands the extent
###4228 of the fine-tuning of the universe and the catastrophic consequences that would ensue
###4233 if it were not finely-tuned.
###4236 Intentional states of consciousness, he did not respond to.
###4240 As for objective moral values, in his book, he admits that naturalism faces an even worse
###4245 problem than the Euthyphro dilemma. For the theist, the Euthyphro dilemma is easy
###4249 to solve, namely you craft a third alternative that God himself is the good and that his
###4256 commands are necessary expressions of his moral nature.
###4260 So, they are neither arbitrary nor is the good something external to God, but on Dr.
###4266 Rosenberg's view there is no basis for moral value or moral objectivity and that's why
###4271 he is a moral nihilist who doesn't think that anything is truly right or wrong.
###4277 As for the resurrection of Jesus, he just doesn't understand, I think, the credibility
###4282 of the New Testament documents in this regard. You can't compare them to Joseph Smith which
###4287 were probably lies or to Muhammad's ascension which is probably a legend, because in this
###4293 case we are dealing with early eye witness testimony that is not the result of conspiracy
###4299 or lie. These people sincerely believed what they
###4302 said and that's why most historians accept those three facts.
###4306 Therefore the naturalist has got to come up with some alternative explanation.
###4311 You can't indict eye witness testimony in general and then use that against a specific
###4316 faith. You have to show in the specific case of the
###4320 gospels that this testimony is unreliable and that is not the opinion of the majority
###4324 of historians who investigated these documents.
###4327 So, for all of these reasons, I think his metaphysical naturalism is wholly unreasonable,
###4334 whereas theism by contrast, I think is eminently reasonable and plausible.
###4339 (Audience clapping)
###4342 Dr. Miller: All right, as soon as Dr. Rosenberg begins, he has his 12-minute rebuttal.
###4359 Timer, begin when he begins.
###4360 Dr. Rosenberg: Gee, what a lot to cover. So, I guess the way to begin is to say I wrote
###4366 this book, The Atheist's Guide to Reality. I actually didn't want to call it The Atheist's
###4371 Guide to Reality, I wanted to call it something else, but my editor said you'll sell a lot
###4375 more books and even get yourself invited for a debate like this if you title a book like
###4381 this.
###4382 Of course, the important thing to remember about that book, The Atheist's Guide to Reality,
###4387 is the structure of its argument; which was, science has a number of important implications.
###4393 In fact, first couple pages of my book I identify 14 of these implications.
###4399 And most of them sound really bizarro; just the way Professor Craig suggested in his remarks.
###4407 The real issue is that among these 14 implications of science that I argued ...
###4413 I'll follow in my book ... one of them is atheism and the others are
###4421 that set of doctrines that Dr. Craig described as absurd.
###4427 None of them is supposed to follow from atheism. None of the things that he says are manifestly
###4434 false and that I've argued for in my book follow from atheism.
###4439 Therefore of course the modus tollens argument as we call it in logic, that Professor Craig
###4444 is trying to advance, is based on a complete misrepresentation of what it says in that
###4449 book.
###4450 What it says in that book is that all of these alleged absurdities along with atheism follow
###4456 from the truth of science. Now, you can reject all of these "alleged
###4461 absurdities", but if I'm right about the logical structure of my arguments, you got to reject
###4468 science. And I don't think Dr. Craig wants to reject
###4470 science; because he's building God on his interpretation of what science is supposed
###4475 to show.
###4477 The only thing you can do of course is, as many of my philosophical colleagues are want
###4481 to do, is reject the argument that I'm out...about what science shows regarding these issues
###4490 like free will, and the nature of the self, and the grounds of morality, and of the purposelessness
###4498 of the universe. That's an interesting and important set of
###4503 issues in philosophy and their issues in the philosophy of science about the relationship
###4509 between science and the agenda of the persistent questions of philosophy.
###4514 They are not questions about the relationship between atheism and these persistent questions.
###4519 And it's simply a Kalo mistake to suppose that you could refute atheism by controverting
###4527 these controversial doctrines that I argue for in philosophy.
###4534 We didn't come here tonight to debate metaphysical naturalism or epistemological naturalism.
###4541 We came here to debate whether the belief in God, faith in God or as I've insisted we
###4548 ought to substitute belief in God is reasonable or not.
###4552 And that question has practically nothing to do with whether the strange theses that
###4562 I argue for in this book are right or not. I would cherish the opportunity to discuss
###4569 the details of these arguments with Professor Craig.
###4572 Let's just take one example, the problem of intentionality.
###4576 The problem of intentionality is a really hard problem to understand in philosophy.
###4580 Dr. Craig mentioned a couple of times that it's the ...
###4583 intentionality is the fact that our thoughts appear to be about stuff like I'm thinking
###4587 about Craig now, and I'm thinking about the timer that says I got eight and a half minutes
###4591 to finish my rebuttal. I'm thinking about stuff ...
###4594 how is that possible, how is it possible for one chunk of matter, my brain, to be about
###4599 intrinsically about another chunk of matter.
###4602 Dr. Craig or the sign announces eight minutes, that is a profound mystery in philosophy with
###4608 which philosophers have been trying to wrestle certainly since Descartes and I think since
###4613 Plato made the point in the Meno, one of his other dialogues.
###4618 How is it possible for one chunk of matter, the brain, to be intrinsically about, directed
###4624 at, pointing at, another chunk of matter?
###4626 You may think that's not a problem, that's not very difficult; but if you start reading
###4630 Descartes, and you read Leibniz; and you read the philosophers in the tradition of Western
###4636 philosophy, you'll see that it's a huge problem. Okay? It's a problem for science, for neuroscience.
###4646 How is it that the wet stuff in the brain can do this? Okay?
###4649 There are two answers to this question. One is Descartes' answer of dualism.
###4654 There is a mind and it's independent of the brain.
###4656 It's a totally different spiritual substance. Theists love this argument for obvious reasons.
###4662 If there's a spiritual substance in us, a soul, a person, a self, independent of our
###4668 brain, well then of course if it's not physical, it's indestructible and it's well on its way
###4672 to immortality, which is just what the Christian religion wants us to believe, okay, that's
###4677 dualism. Okay?
###4679 Most scientists aren't dualist, there's the odd exception, Eccles and even some philosophers
###4685 like Descartes or Popper, but most scientists; most neuroscientists think that cognition
###4689 is a brain process. The problem is to explain how the brain process,
###4695 one chunk of matter, can have this property of aboutness.
###4698 That question has nothing to do ... nothing interesting to do with atheism or
###4705 theism.
###4706 Let's take the matter of numbers, okay. Dr. Craig says, it's a miracle or it's a wild
###4712 coincidence that mathematics is applicable to science, on my view.
###4720 Well, he hasn't reckoned with the remarkable number of alternative mathematical objects
###4727 that mathematics have conjured up, have thought about, have theorized about, or about the
###4733 remarkable range of possible mathematical functions relating these objects, okay.
###4738 The fact is that we know that there are indefinitely many mathematical objects and indefinitely
###4744 many functions relating these mathematical objects.
###4748 And it's a sheer argument from ignorance to suggest that the number is so small; the number
###4754 that apply to the world of this vast range, is so small that it demands divine authority
###4761 to make it come out that way. Just the geometries alone, the non-Euclidean
###4766 geometries alone, there are indefinitely many of them.
###4770 And it happens that in the small one of them appears to apply on this planet and in larger
###4778 spaces another applies, but any one of an indefinitely large number could perfectly
###4784 well apply in the universe. The suggestion that it's some mystery that
###4790 could only be explained by God's good graciousness to the physicists just seems to me, bizarre
###4798 again, just something that "beggars the imagination".
###4803 So, I guess the last thing I want to talk about is Dr. Craig's brief rejoinder that
###4812 ... that I somehow need or that he can get away
###4826 with showing or with asserting that there's no logical incompatibility between God's being
###4832 omnipotent and benevolent and the existence of suffering.
###4837 Now, Christian philosophers have been worried about this problem from hell at least since
###4845 the greatest of them, Leibniz, okay. They have done handsprings and twisted themselves
###4851 up in knots to try to find some explanation, because logically speaking if God is omniscient,
###4858 and God is omnipotent, and God is truly benevolent has a totally good will and would never will
###4865 anything but for the best, then the existence of suffering on our planet, human suffering,
###4872 and natural suffering of other animals for example, is something that needs desperately
###4881 to be explained.
###4883 And we've had over the course of 400 to 500 years of wrestling with this problem, the
###4887 free will defense and the mystery-mongering, it's God's will defense.
###4893 And nobody has managed to provide a satisfactory explanation and I insist that the problem
###4901 is logical. Dr. Craig needs to tell us exactly how an
###4906 omnipotent God and entirely benevolent God had to have the holocaust in order to produce
###4915 the good outcome whatever it might be that he intends for our ultimate providence.
###4924 Couldn't he have just gotten away with World War I, or the Great Leap Forward, or the 30
###4932 years war which killed untold millions, or the bubonic plague that killed 40% of the
###4939 population of Europe? Did he have to have every one of those in order to produce the
###4945 kind of beneficent outcome which it is divine providence to expect? I just don't see it.
###4954 I cannot understand it. I find it offensive and I find it perplexing.
###4962 And in all honesty, if Dr. Craig could provide me with any kind of a logical, coherent account
###4972 that could reconcile the evident fact of the horrors of human and infrahuman life on this
###4980 planet over the last 3.5 billion years, with the existence of a benevolent, omnipotent
###4987 agent, then I will turn Christian. Thank you.
###4995 (Audience clapping)
###4998 Dr. Miller: Okay, we now begin our eight-minute rebuttals.
###5005 Dr. Craig anytime you're ready. Timer, begin when he starts speaking.
###5009 Dr. Craig: I am really excited about that last statement (audience laughing) that Dr.
###5017 Rosenberg made (audience clapping). Honestly, Dr. Rosenberg if you were to read
###5024 the work of people like Alvin Plantinga, Peter van Inwagen, and others on this problem with
###5031 evil, you would know that hardly anyone today defends the logical version of the problem
###5036 of evil; because the atheist simply hasn't been able to shoulder the burden of proof
###5041 required to put it through.
###5042 Listen to what Paul Draper who is an agnostic philosopher here in the Department of Purdue
###5047 says. He says, "Logical arguments from evil are
###5051 a dying (dead) breed". For all we know, even an omnipotent and omniscient
###5058 being, might be forced to allow evil for the sake of obtaining some important good.
###5065 Our knowledge of goods and evils and the logical relations they have to each other is much
###5070 too limited to prove that this could not be the case."
###5074 In particular the atheist assumes that if God is all powerful, He can create just any
###5080 world that he wants and that's not necessarily true.
###5083 If God wills to create free creatures then he can't guarantee they'll always do what
###5089 is right. It's logically impossible to make someone
###5093 freely do something. So, God's being all-powerful doesn't mean
###5097 He can do the logically impossible.
###5099 So, the atheist would have to prove there's a world of free creatures which God could
###5104 create which has as much good as this world but without as much evil.
###5111 How could he possibly prove that, that's pure speculation? What about the other premise
###5116 that if God is all good, then He would create a world without evil.
###5120 Well, the problem here is that we're assuming that God's purpose is just to make us happy
###5125 in this life, but on the Christian view, that's false.
###5129 The purpose of life is not worldly happiness as such but rather the knowledge of God.
###5135 There may be many evils that occur in this lifetime that are utterly pointless with respect
###5140 to producing worldly happiness but they may not be pointless with respect to producing
###5146 a knowledge of God and salvation and eternal life.
###5150 It's possibly ... it's possible that only in the world that
###5153 is suffused with natural and moral evil that the optimal number of people would come to
###5158 know God freely, find salvation and eternal life.
###5163 So, the atheist would have to prove that there's another possible world that has this much
###5168 knowledge of God and His salvation in, but which is produced with less evils.
###5173 How could he possibly prove that? It's pure conjecture.
###5177 It's impossible to prove those things; and that's why the logical version of the problem
###5182 of evil has been widely abandoned. Peter van Inwagen, Professor of Philosophy
###5187 at Notre Dame, says, "It used to be held that evil was incompatible with the existence of
###5192 God, that no possible world contained both God and evil.
###5196 So far as I am able to tell this thesis is no longer defended."
###5200 So, Dr. Rosenberg, I want to invite you to think about becoming a theist tonight, because
###5208 the main obstacle that you presented is need not be an obstacle for you anymore.
###5215 What about the positive arguments that I offered for God's existence? The first one is why
###5219 anything at all exists? There's been no response in tonight's debate to this first argument.
###5226 You can't just say the universe exists without an explanation, if it's contingent.
###5230 If it is contingent, as Dr. Rosenberg states in his book, there could have been nothing,
###5234 so why is there something rather than nothing? The theist has an explanation but the atheist
###5241 by its own admission has no explanation. What about the problem of the origin of the
###5245 universe?
###5246 I showed that it's to no avail to appeal to quantum mechanics, because in quantum mechanics
###5251 things don't come into being from non-being, from nothing, they come out of the energy
###5255 in the vacuum; but for the universe to come into being, it would have to come from literally
###5260 nothing, because the beginning of the universe is the beginning of all matter and energy
###5265 and space and time.
###5267 Again theism has an explanation for how the universe came into being, but atheism is impotent
###5273 in this regard. The applicability of mathematics, all Dr.
###5277 Rosenberg could say is there are various alternative mathematics like non-Euclidean geometries.
###5282 That doesn't go one-inch toward explaining why our physical universe is structured on
###5288 this incredibly complex mathematical structure and foundation.
###5293 Again the theist has an easy explanation. God constructed the universe on this mathematical
###5299 structure. The naturalist is at a lost to explain it.
###5303 What about the fine-tuning of the universe? I explained the disasters results that would
###5308 ensue if the universe were not fine-tuned. I also explained why you can't dismiss this
###5313 problem by the multiverse hypothesis; and there has been no response to that.
###5318 Intentional states of consciousness, Dr. Rosenberg says, "How can one chunk of matter be about
###5324 another one?" I agree with him on this. It can't and that leads him to deny that we
###5330 ever think about anything. It leads me rather to say but I do think about
###5335 things, therefore there must be minds. And minds fit nicely into a theistic world
###5341 view, because God is the ultimate mind and so the presence of finite minds in this world
###5347 is nothing mysterious. It fits into a theistic world in a way that
###5351 it doesn't fit into an atheistic world.
###5354 As for objective moral values, it's the same situation, Dr. Rosenberg rightly understands
###5360 that if atheism is true, if metaphysical naturalism is true, there are no objective moral values
###5366 and duties. He and I actually agree on a great deal, but
###5370 what I would say is obviously it is wrong to do certain things.
###5374 Therefore it follows that there must be a foundation for moral values beyond the physical
###5379 world in God, a transcendent personal being.
###5383 The resurrection of Jesus, again you can't discuss this responsibly without getting your
###5387 fingers dirty and looking at those documents. You can't attack other documents like Joseph
###5393 Smith and Muhammad and use those to impugn the credibility of the gospel sources.
###5398 The fact is that the majority of New Testament historians, who have investigated these documents,
###5403 have concluded to those three facts that I mentioned.
###5406 Remember N.T. Wright says, they're as firmly established
###5409 as the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, but the naturalist has no explanation.
###5414 Finally, God can be personally known and experienced. Why can't God be a properly basic belief for
###5420 me, grounded in my experience of God? I don't see why not.
###5425 Finally, what about metaphysical naturalism? How is this relevant in tonight's debate?
###5430 He says these bizarre consequences that he affirms don't follow from atheism, they follow
###5436 from scientism; but my argument was that scientism or epistemological naturalism doesn't imply
###5444 metaphysical naturalism; remember the case of W.V.O.
###5447 Quine, "...but if God does not exist then I think metaphysical naturalism is true".
###5455 Metaphysical naturalism doesn't follow from epistemological naturalism, but it does follow
###5460 from atheism. The most plausible form of atheism is I think
###5465 metaphysical naturalism, but there are all those absurd consequences that result from
###5471 that that I described. He bites the bullet and affirms these bizarre
###5475 consequences. Why not stand back and say, no this is crazy
###5481 this is not the world we live in?
###5483 Ours must be a theistic world. If his only obstacle is the logical problem
###5488 of evil; then that obstacle has now been removed. Dr. Rosenberg should find himself free to
###5495 embrace, joyfully, the existence of God as the answer to these deep questions.
###5502 (Audience clapping).
###5506 Dr. Miller: Professor Rosenberg may now begin his eight-minute rebuttal.
###5518 Timer.
###5520 Dr. Rosenberg: So, just as, of course, Dr. Craig is repeating himself.
###5531 I guess I don't have much recourse but to repeat myself, because just as he suggests
###5537 that I haven't answered one or another of his points, he similarly hasn't answered any
###5542 number of mine. But, that's the problem with this kind of
###5545 a debate and this kind of a format, it doesn't work.
###5548 It doesn't work because what I would like to be able to do is ask William Lane Craig
###5554 a question and listen to his answer and formulate a reply, and listen to his answer, and then
###5559 give a view, and listen to his question; which is the way in which philosophical dialogue
###5565 proceeds and which enables us at least to find out where the crucial issues are between
###5572 us and how we could mutually agree to adjudicate these matters.
###5577 So now, I really need to know why he's so committed to the principle of sufficient reason
###5583 which underwrites a good half of the arguments from science which he advances for us.
###5590 I made the point that the principles of sufficient reason is false, it's not just that it's not
###5596 known to be true; it's that it's just plain out flat false and disconfirmed all over the
###5603 galaxy, all over the universe, all over the multiverse; indefinitely many times in an
###5612 infinitesimally small units of time.
###5615 And I don't understand why he insists that it's just intuitively obvious, it's just ...
###5623 "What could be more obvious that from nothing, nothing can come, that if something exists
###5630 there had to be a prior entity of some sort which brought it about?" We know that alpha
###5639 particles come into existence for no reason at all, every moment in this room.
###5645 Why should we assume that the universe is any different? Why should we assume that purely
###5651 quantum mechanical fluctuations symmetry breaking, which we understand is the explanation for
###5658 why there's matter in the universe and not anti-matter.
###5662 Why this process which produces the characteristic features of our universe and does so without
###5670 there being a cause for it happening one way or the other, why the symmetry gets broken
###5675 one way or the other. Could it be the nature of reality as far back
###5682 as we can possibly dig in cosmology?
###5686 Let's talk about the argument from evil. I keep hearing these quotes.
###5691 He's even invoking my best friend, Peter van Inwagen, asserting that nobody anymore believes
###5699 that the argument from evil is a problem for theism.
###5704 Not ... where I come from ...
###5705 where I come from that's the first thing that we worry about, how can you reconcile theism
###5713 and evil. Now, you can reconcile God and evil if you
###5717 reduce his power from omnipotence or you reduce his benevolence to only, "he's pretty good"
###5723 or "he's good most of the time".
###5728 Even a philosopher like Peter van Inwagen, who I think is probably the best metaphysician
###5733 working in our field today, even he, can't go any further than in his book The Problem
###5741 of Evil, his Gifford Lectures in 2004. Even he can't go any further than saying that
###5746 he thinks that the argument from evil is not decisive; that it doesn't absolutely and completely
###5755 destroy theism. It's not as he says a successful argument.
###5760 The reasons that he gives, I would be embarrassed to lay before you; because they have to do
###5766 with an argument called the Sorites an argument that has been known since the time of the
###5771 Greeks. And that is the sort of argument that gives
###5775 philosophy a bad name among more well-grounded, less theoretical people.
###5783 Professor Craig invoked the free will defense that God gave us free will.
###5789 And because he gave us free will, he gave us the power to do evil and the evil is done
###5796 by us as a result of our exercise of free will.
###5803 Well, I have three things to say about this. The first is he didn't need ...
###5807 he could have given us freewill without giving us the holocaust or the bubonic plague.
###5813 He could have done it with... given us freewill, without giving us all the
###5817 horrors of the history of our species.
###5821 The second thing is he made some people, apparently, and gave them free will and they caused no
###5827 suffering at all, whether it's small children or the saints of the Catholic Church or whoever
###5834 your favorite person without sin, may be. The third thing is this; let's think about
###5842 the following very simple thought experiment. Supposed I give you all an arithmetic test.
###5848 You all have free will. You can all choose.
###5851 I give you an arithmetic test. It's a hundred questions and they're all of
###5855 the form three plus five equals, or 16 divided by two equals, or the square of four equals.
###5864 I offer you a thousand dollars for each right answer and excruciating pain for each wrong
###5871 answer. Right? You all have freewill.
###5874 How many of you are going to give me any wrong answers? None of you.
###5879 You're all going to have a thousand ... $10,000 at the end of a 10 question arithmetic
###5883 test. You all had free will.
###5886 You all chose freely. And you always gave me the right answer.
###5889 Why couldn't God have arranged the universe and us, so that we all have free will and
###5896 temptation was never presented to us? Or when it was presented to us, we always chose rightly.
###5904 Why couldn't God have arranged matters that way, given us freewill and so arranged matters
###5909 that in our exercise of freewill we never chose evil, we never chose the outcome that
###5917 produced suffering from anybody? That seems to me a logical coherent possibility and it's
###5922 enough to show that the problem of evil remains with us.
###5928 New Testament scholarship. You know, I have great respect for New Testament
###5933 scholars and for the higher criticism and for the deep scholars of the Christian religion,
###5939 who study the New Testament. Some of them have told us that 75% of it was
###5944 forged and all of us tell us that it was written by people who were illiterate.
###5950 And most of them recognize that the writings Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John could not have
###5958 dated from any earlier than 30 or 40 or 50 years after Jesus lived.
###5965 Of course, the Aramaic in which they were written, was completely lost and all the extant
###5971 New Testaments are in Greek.
###5973 And therefore the opportunity for misrepresentation, or mistranscription, or other kinds of mistakes
###5982 was huge and indeed has been documented by scholarship over the last 200 years, but most
###5988 of all why should we accept the credibility of Christian scholars writing about Christian
###5995 documents? No more than we should accept the scholarship of Islamic scholars writing about

###6010 Dr. Miller: Dr. Craig will now begin his closing statement.
###6019 He has five minutes.
###6021 Dr. Craig: Well, I want to thank Dr. Rosenberg for a very stimulating debate this evening.
###6031 I hope that you've enjoyed it as much as I have.
###6034 In my closing statement, I'd like to draw together some of the threads of this debate
###6038 and see if we can come to some conclusions. In tonight's debate, I presented eight reasons
###6044 why it's reasonable to believe in God and eight reasons why metaphysical naturalism
###6051 is unreasonable in fact absurd.
###6054 Dr. Rosenberg has presented only one argument for atheism tonight and that is the problem
###6060 of evil. And it was very clear in his last speech that
###6064 he hasn't understood it. He says, why couldn't God have created people
###6068 with free will so that they always chose to do the right thing? This has been dealt with
###6074 by theist's dealing with the problem of evil. And the reason is because the wrong subjunctive
###6080 conditionals of freedom might be true for God to actualize such a world.
###6085 There are possible worlds which are not feasible for God to actualize, because if he were to
###6091 create the creatures in certain circumstances and leave them free they would go wrong.
###6096 As far as we know, for all we know in any world of free creatures in which there is
###6101 this much good in the world, there would also be this much evil.
###6105 It may not be feasible for God to actualize a world having this much good without this
###6111 much evil.
###6112 That doesn't mean the holocaust is necessary, no not at all, but it would mean that in a
###6117 world in which say, the holocaust didn't occur, other events would have occur that would have
###6122 been comparably evil. So, what Dr. Rosenberg again would have to
###6126 show or that the atheist would have to show is that there's no ...
###6130 he would have to show that God has the ability to create another world, another possible
###6135 world of free creatures that would involve this much knowledge of God and eternal salvation
###6141 as in the actual world, but without as much suffering.
###6144 And there's no way that the atheist could prove that, it's utter speculation and that's
###6149 why the argument is regarded today as bankrupt.
###6153 Now, with respect to the arguments for metaphysical naturalism.
###6160 I think what Dr. Rosenberg has done for us is he has described brilliantly what an atheistic
###6166 world would be like. It is a world in which there is no meaning,
###6171 no truth, no thoughts about anything, no moral values, no enduring selves and no first person
###6178 perspectives. His only mistake lies in thinking that that
###6183 world is our world, but it manifestly is not, our world is not Dr. Rosenberg's world.
###6191 Our world is a world in which we do exist. We do have thoughts about things in which
###6197 there is therefore meaning, truth, and value. Dr. Rosenberg admits that theism provides
###6204 a better explanation of such a world than does atheism.
###6208 And since our world is evidently such a world, it follows, I think that it is reasonable
###6214 to believe in God.
###6216 In addition to that, I presented eight arguments for belief in God.
###6222 He, in his last speech, said, "Why are you so committed to the principle of sufficient
###6225 reason?" Because a very modest version of that is plausibly true; namely that if a contingent
###6233 thing exists, there's a reason or an explanation to why it exists rather than not.
###6239 Given that principle which is very plausible and modest, you need an explanation for why
###6243 the universe exists.
###6245 This is especially evident if the universe came into being at some point in the finite
###6249 past. It can't just come from non-being.
###6253 I won't repeat what I said about the applicability of mathematics, intentional states of consciousness,
###6258 objective moral values, the resurrection of Jesus, the sources we have for the resurrection
###6264 of Jesus go back to within five years of the event.
###6267 And they were not written in Aramaic. He is just incorrect.
###6270 They were written in Greek. We have the New Testament in the original
###6275 language in which it was written and the text is 99.8% authentic and pure.
###6281 So, doubts on that head are simply groundless.
###6285 The one thing that we haven't talked about tonight is my eighth point that God can be
###6289 personally known and experienced. And I want to close by saying this, I myself
###6294 wasn't raised in a believing home, although it was a good and loving home; but when I
###6301 was in high school as a junior, I met a Christian who sat in front of me in German class, who
###6306 shared with me her faith about God's love.
###6309 I had never heard of this before. I began to read the New Testament, and as
###6313 I did I was captivated by the person of Jesus of Nazareth.
###6317 Well, I went through a period of six months of soul searching, at the end of which, I
###6321 just came to the end my rope and gave my life to Christ.
###6325 I experienced an inner spiritual rebirth that I've walked with day-by-day, year-by-year
###6331 now for over 40 years.
###6332 A spiritual reality, that I believe you can find as well if you will seek Him with an
###6337 open mind and an open heart. So as I close tonight, I would encourage you,
###6341 if you're seeking for God, do what I did. Pick up the New Testament, begin to read,
###6345 and ask yourself, "Could this really be the truth? Could there be a God who loves me and
###6351 cares for me? Who gave himself for me?" I believe it could change your life; just as
###6356 it changed mine. (Audience clapping)
###6366 Dr. Miller: Professor Rosenberg will now give his five-minute concluding statement.
###6376 Dr. Rosenberg: So, here's another positive argument for atheism.
###6381 It's sort of so obvious that I hadn't thought I should introduce it and I certainly didn't
###6388 think I was going to have time, but this back and forth has gone on so long that I've got
###6392 this last chance and I'm going to use it.
###6396 So, why is it that God is a hypothesis that science has so little use for? You may recall
###6407 when the King of France, Louis the XIV approached Laplace the Great 18th century physicist and
###6414 said what is the role of God in your system. The answer was, "I have no need of that hypothesis".
###6422 Of course the reason that science has no need of the hypothesis, is that God makes no contribution
###6427 to the predictive power of any part of any of the sciences.
###6433 For that reason, there's no basis on which to invoke God either for explanatory or any
###6440 other purposes in science. Therefore science has no more need for and
###6447 indeed a considerable reason to deny the existence of God than it has to accept the Easter Bunny,
###6455 or the Tooth Fairy, or Santa Claus. The absence of a role for God in the predictive
###6465 and explanatory content of science is quite apart from the problem of evil, the principle
###6472 reason why 95% of the members of the National Academy of Science in the United States are
###6476 atheists; and why science can provide not only no good basis for theism, but an excellent
###6483 argument against it.
###6485 Indeed, if we think back to the invocation of Willard Van Orman Quine, the Great American
###6490 Philosopher by Professor Craig, we'll recall that he pointed out that Quine adopts abstract
###6500 objects, the objects of mathematics as existing even though they are abstract, even though
###6505 they're not concrete, even though they're not physical items in the world.
###6510 Why? Because they were indispensible to their predictive power of science; and because they're
###6517 indispensible, Quine had no good argument against them and said that science not only
###6523 had no good argument against them, but in fact it had a good argument for their existence
###6528 because of the contribution they made to enabling us to predict detailed experiments meter readings,
###6537 right, of scientific experiments, which is the "litmus test of reasonability" among science
###6544 ... scientists.
###6546 And to invoke the objects of mathematics, as a part of an argument for the existence
###6551 of God, fails to reflect this indispensible fact about the reasons that scientists are
###6560 committed to do. If God could do as much for science as the
###6565 number two, physicists would be much more receptive to his existence.
###6569 So, let me end this debate with a little advice from an atheist.
###6577 Dr. Craig has ended by making a personal statement about the importance of Jesus Christ to his
###6587 own character and well being, his own spiritual state.
###6595 Believe if you want to, have faith in Jesus Christ if you need to, but do not make yourself
###6603 vulnerable to reason and evidence, do not demand that your belief be reasonable.
###6609 You will be threatened with the loss of your faith.
###6612 You may well lose your faith.
###6614 Those who have lost their faith in God are generally those who have felt the need for
###6621 good reasons, for evidence, for argument, better that you should take as your slogan
###6627 credo quia absurdum "I believe because it is absurd." That's a far sure basis.
###6636 It's not an epistemologically respectable one, but it's a psychologically far firmer
###6641 basis to believe in the existence of God.
###6645 You cannot accept that faith is reasonable, but that doesn't stop you from believing.
###6652 Of course, those friends of mine who are devout Christians, of whom I count a number of people
###6658 that Professor Craig mentioned tonight, and even Professor Craig with whom I'm sure I
###6664 will have a friendly exchange after this debate is over, (audience laughing) even Professor
###6670 Craig I'm sure will tell you that that is, in many ways, the firmest basis for commitment
###6679 to Jesus, faith and not reason. Thank you.
###6686 Dr. Miller: Well, this concludes the debate portion of tonight's event.
###6700 Please give our debaters a hand for very spirited debate.
###6703 (Audience clapping)
###6706 Now they're hugging; now we're friends.
###6713 Dr. Rosenberg: So, I said to Bill, "Now you know how the presidential candidates feel
###6722 right after their debate". (Laughing).
###6725 Dr. Miller: It will go on in the form of a book Is Faith in God Reasonable.
###6731 For our next aspect of tonight's event we begin the question and answer period for our
###6738 live ... we have three different elements of this.
###6740 Let me explain this. For our live Purdue audience, if you've got
###6743 a probing question, please approach the microphones at the front.
###6747 If I can have our microphone bouncers, they are evil microphone bouncers stand.
###6753 If you've got a question for Professor Craig, line up here.
###6756 If you've got a question for Professor Rosenberg, please line up over here.
###6760 Ensure that the questions are well thought out, are concise, and you will not be giving
###6766 a lecture yourself. Then as soon as you asked your question, unless
###6772 there is a followup from the debater asking you to clarify, then please have a sit.
###6779 I will ask the debaters to limit their responses to two minutes and then they may exchange
###6789 words over those responses briefly. After the ...
###6795 while the Q&A is going on, let me ask the judges to write up their conclusions and you
###6800 as the audience, please fill out those comment cards we gave to you, those response cards,
###6805 now is the time to decide who you think won the debate.
###6809 After the Q&A terminates, we will announce all voting results, our judges, our Purdue
###6813 audience, and all who respond online so please pass your cards as soon as you get that filled
###6819 out like within the next 15 seconds, past it to the inside isles.
###6824 And volunteers, now is the time for you to come forward with buckets and begin collecting
###6830 in a couple of seconds those cards.
###6834 For our 10,000 plus listening to this online and around the world, you can vote, you can
###6841 submit a question. If you're in front of a computer you'll see
###6844 the vote link above the player and the submit question to the right of your screen.
###6850 Voting online will close in 20 minutes, so do it now.
###6854 If you are viewing with a group, visit www.biola.edu/debate from your Smart Phone to submit a question
###6864 and a runner will bring me questions submitted from the website for our debaters.
###6869 Now, let's begin the debate. We will take a question beginning over on
###6875 this side from someone for Dr. Craig, do it again over here for Dr. Rosenberg, once more
###6882 for Dr. Craig, once more for Dr. Rosenberg and then we will take one online from somewhere
###6888 across our web.
###6890 So, if I can have it a little bit quiet please in the audience, please fill out those forms
###6896 but maintain relative quiet so that we can continue with this next session.
###6903 All right, first question for Dr. Craig, go ahead.
###6909 Speaker 1: In your published works, you've talked about something that's conspicuously
###6914 missing from this debate; the relation between reason and faith.
###6920 For example, in Reasonable Faith you point out that when faith is in conflict with the
###6925 evidence and argument, it's the latter rather than the former that should be disregarded.
###6931 On the face of it, that seems like to mount nothing less than an endorsement of confirmation
###6937 bias. It should go without saying, that an open-armed
###6940 embrace of conservation...confirmation bias is nothing reasonable at all.
###6946 However, you, in other areas have expounded upon this and taking what might be considered
###6955 a personal epistemological code and to something of a normative claim.
###6961 The example I have in mind is when you're asked about, "How Christians should respond
###6969 to their doubts?" You gave the same answer but with an explanation and that's a kicker.
###6977 You posited that...
###6978 Dr. Miller: Can you be concise and just ask your question?
###6981 Speaker 1: I'm trying to get to it. What you effectively did...
###6989 skipping ahead because the moderator ... was posit instead of the possibility of the
###6995 Cartesian demon... the actuality of the Cartesian demon...
###7000 So as you pointed out Hume... that Descartes didn't take the radical skepticism
###7006 far enough and introspection, you don't get a unified entity having these perceptions,
###7014 you only get the perceptions. On your framework, how do you and, since it
###7020 was a normative claim, all other Christians escape this downward spiral of radical skepticism?
###7026 Dr. Miller: Go ahead and have a seat thanks for the question.
###7030 Dr. Craig: In tonight's debate I took the word faith to mean the same thing as believe.
###7039 Faith in God, believe in God. Let us say believe that God exists, but you're
###7043 quite right in saying there's another understanding of faith that is more than just propositional
###7048 belief. It would be the idea of trusting in someone,
###7052 committing one's life to someone. And I would say that, that kind of faith would
###7058 be subsequent to propositional belief. You first believe that God exists, and then
###7065 you can believe in God, and put your faith in him.
###7069 Now in the chapter that you were speaking of in Reasonable Faith, when I'm speaking
###7074 of faith there, I am talking about... how do we know the propositional truths of
###7083 the Christian faith like that God exists or that God loves me and so forth.
###7088 What I was suggesting there is that in addition to external arguments and evidence, there
###7095 is also this immediate testimony of God himself to one that gives you in a properly basic
###7104 way, a knowledge of God's existence and the great truths of the gospel.
###7110 That was my eighth point in tonight's debate that God can be personally known and experienced.
###7116 And I said this isn't an argument rather it's suggesting that just as we have properly basic
###7122 beliefs like the belief in the reality of the external world, or the reality, the past,
###7129 so belief in God could be a properly basic belief grounded in the inner witness of the
###7134 Holy Spirit. So, this isn't some kind of fideism or leap
###7138 in the dark sort of thing it's saying that, God himself can give a person a knowledge
###7145 of his existence that is independent of argument and evidence.
###7150 And this is a view that's widely defended today especially by Alvin Plantinga and his
###7156 book Warranted Christian Belief. And I think he shown that there aren't any
###7161 philosophical objections to this point of view.
###7165 It's a perfectly coherent religious epistemology.
###7168 Dr. Miller: All right, question for Dr. Rosenberg. Go ahead.
###7175 Speaker 2: Dr. Rosenberg, having taught chemistry for 40 years and having a degree from a major
###7183 big ten university in chemistry. I'm very interested if you could go a little
###7187 bit into more detail why the decay of Uranium 238 violates any of the principles that Dr.
###7194 Craig gave for the existence of God? (Audience clapping)
###7201 Dr. Rosenberg: Thanks, it's a nice question because it gives me a chance to put this case
###7209 before everybody a little more clearly. So, you've got two uranium atoms, same number
###7216 of neutrons, same number of protons, same number of electrons; all of them at the same
###7222 quantum states and quantum energy levels. And they're not merely as identical as two
###7229 peas in a pod. They're much more identical than that in all
###7233 of their physical properties.
###7236 At a certain moment, one of them emits and the other does not emit an alpha particle,
###7243 that is to say, the nucleus of a helium atom. The difference between these two atoms is
###7255 that one of them emitted and the other didn't. Now if every event has to have a cause, if
###7261 everything that comes into existence has to have a cause of it's coming into existence;
###7265 then there's got to be some difference between the two atoms in virtue of which one of them
###7271 emitted an alpha particle and the other didn't; but quantum mechanics tells us and all the
###7277 experimental evidence which confirms it to 12 decimal places tells us there is no difference,
###7284 end of story.
###7286 There is an event without a cause. There is no causally relevant difference between
###7293 the two molecules in virtue of which one emitted an alpha particle and the other didn't.
###7299 Dr. Craig: Well, that's not the end of the story.
###7307 There are at least 10 different physical interpretations of quantum mechanics.
###7313 Some of these are fully deterministic and nobody knows which one of this is true.
###7319 Victor Stenger who is atheistic physicist says this in his book.
###7326 He says, "Other viable interpretations of quantum mechanics remain with no consensus
###7332 on which, if any of them is the correct one."
###7335 So, He says, "We have to remain open to the possibility that causes may someday be found
###7341 for such phenomena." There are deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics that
###7347 may well be correct. In any event, my argument never appealed to
###7351 the premise that every event has a cause. It was deliberately formulated in such a way
###7357 as to allow for quantum indeterminacy.
###7361 Without prejudicing the issue, my argument is that if the universe began to exist, had
###7366 an absolute beginning then the universe has a transcendent cause.
###7370 And quantum mechanics is simply irrelevant to that, because we're talking about an absolute
###7375 beginning of space and time, matter and energy. There's nothing in physics that would explain
###7381 how being comes from non-being.
###7383 Dr. Rosenberg: I need to make a short response to that with your permission.
###7388 This is not an issue about the interpretation of quantum mechanics.
###7391 I happen to think that among the interpretations of quantum mechanics, the deterministic ...
###7396 some of the deterministic ones are more plausible than others.
###7399 This is a matter of experimental physics. This is a matter of a fact about the nature
###7404 of reality.
###7406 And it also seems to me clear that, in so far as we have here, good evidence that things
###7413 can happen with no cause at all, it follows that therefore the universe can come into
###7420 existence with no cause at all. And indeed, that's what the best guesses of
###7426 contemporary physical theorists is.
###7430 Dr. Miller: Alright, for Dr. Craig.
###7439 Speaker 3: I would like to ask you about your use of the existence of "objective morality"
###7447 as an argument. Because, there are differences due to society
###7454 or religious beliefs that lead to people having different moralities such as like the practice
###7460 of Sharia Law or the death penalty. So, how can ...
###7467 if God gave us, like as humanity objective morality, then why do we have such conflicting
###7474 views of morality and what is right and wrong?
###7477 Dr. Craig: The question you're raising is not a question about moral ontology, that
###7484 is to say, the reality or the foundation of moral values.
###7488 Your question is about moral epistemology and that is how do we come to know moral values
###7494 and duties? It's no part of my case to say that moral questions are always easy.
###7501 Certainly there are areas of gray where good people will disagree and will differ.
###7506 It's not always easy to discern what is right or what is wrong in certain situations.
###7512 But, what I am saying is that we do have in moral experience, a very clear grasp of cases
###7520 where there are clearly objective moral values and objective duties or obligations and prohibitions.
###7528 And so, by no means, am I suggesting that all of these cases are clear, all you need
###7534 is a few really, any and you've got to then explain what is the ontological foundation
###7540 in reality for these moral values.
###7544 Dr. Miller: No sorry, no follow-up questions. Thank you.
###7550 All right, for Dr. Rosenberg.
###7553 Speaker 4: Yes doctor, so with a lot of debates such as this, the question becomes an argument
###7560 of looking at the same evidence and coming up with different conclusions.
###7563 As a result of this, people become I supposed heated in this debates, and so there is certain
###7569 level of arrogance on both sides.
###7571 This is more of a question to both of you. How is it that you deal with this sort of
###7579 issue where you a lot of the arguments made by you ...
###7582 and I'm an atheist so I'm with you on a lot of them ...
###7585 a lot of them posit a sort of attack on the other viewpoint.
###7591 As a result, the other person becomes very defensive and attacks your view point.
###7595 How is it that both of you help address and calm that issue?
###7600 Dr. Rosenberg: I have no idea. (Audience laughing).
###7607 I suppose, as I said at the beginning, that I don't think that debate format the eristic
###7615 context of prosecutorial and defense attorneys in a adversarial relationship is the right
###7623 venue under which to purse philosophical and theological inquiry.
###7628 In fact, I'm very confident that it isn't.
###7632 I have spent a lot of time in my life with Peter van Inwagen.
###7638 And we have often argued about issues like this ...
###7641 discussed issues like this, tried to find out ...
###7643 to identify where are differences are and how we might adjudicate them.
###7649 It's a difficult process; it's a process that's been going on in philosophy and rational theology
###7653 for at least 2,400 years in the West. It certainly hasn't attained consensus, but
###7663 at its best it's not controversialist.
###7666 It's unfortunate that some fora because they make for entertainment or sell books and CDs
###7673 and stuff like that, emerge in which such debates sharpen controversies, but they are
###7683 not the ideal indeed, they're not even satisfactory venues for pursuing these questions.
###7690 Dr. Craig: I'm glad for the question, because I think while we may be passionate about our
###7699 arguments and point of view, I think it's extremely important that these kinds of debates
###7705 be conducted with civility, and charity, and honesty.
###7711 I think you try to represent your opponent's point of view fairly, you prepare by reading
###7719 his work carefully, and pointing out the areas of disagreement, but you do so in a way that
###7725 is gentlemanly and civil without personal attacks upon character.
###7733 I think that these kinds of forums are very valuable that doesn't mean they're the only
###7739 kind of forum. Obviously he and I both publish in professional
###7742 journals, we read papers at professional conferences, publish books, but most of you students will
###7749 never read a professional philosophy journal or attend a professional conference.
###7754 These debates are important as a way of getting this information disseminated to a wider public
###7762 in a way that is passionate and firm, but it's civil and it's an academic exchange;
###7769 these are as old as the Middle Ages. Back in the Middle Ages they used to have
###7772 what they call Quaestionis Disputatis, "Disputed Questions" of theology.
###7778 We're continuing a long tradition,
###7781 I think of having a good solid academic debate over these issues and I hope that people would
###7787 be stimulated by what said tonight to go out and look further and read, and investigate,
###7793 and think harder about these, maybe take some classes in philosophy, or theology, or New
###7798 Testament studies about these matters. I'm firmly committed to the value of these
###7803 kinds of forum on university campuses.
###7806 I'm glad Dr. Rosenberg despite his scruples agreed to participate tonight.
###7812 (Audience clapping)
###7816 Dr. Miller: Given that we have a ton of questions here and we've got probably twice as many
###7824 people watching live stream. In fairness, I'm going to ask one of each
###7829 of our debaters from within the United States and then one with outside of the United States.
###7834 So, first of all, Dr. Craig from Anthony in Newburyport, Massachusetts: With respect to
###7842 the fine-tuning of the theological argument, aren't you presupposing atheism since God
###7847 could have made the universal without needing to have it fine-tuned?
###7850 Dr. Craig: The fine-tuning argument doesn't presuppose anything about how God could have
###7861 done it in the sense that he could have created a world say of just spirit beings without
###7867 any physical beings at all; but fine-tuning simply means that the fundamental constants
###7874 and quantities in the universe that are necessary for life, fall into an extraordinarily narrow
###7883 range of values; an infinitesimal range almost. Such that if these values were to be altered
###7890 by even a hair's breadth or less rather, the balance would be upset and life could not
###7895 exist in a universe governed by these laws. And so, that's all the debate is about.
###7901 It's not about whether God could have created other universes with other laws of nature
###7907 that weren't fine-tuned. It's about whether or not ...
###7910 or what is the best explanation for the fine-tuning of the universe that characterizes this univ...
###7920 the universe we live in. And, I think that the best explanation is
###7924 intelligent design. Physical necessity, and chance just won't
###7930 offer plausible accounts of this fact.
###7933 Dr. Miller: Okay, one for Dr. Rosenberg and this one I had to take this.
###7942 This is kind of funny because of this Purdue audience this is from IU.
###7950 They are actually watching with a Christian Ministry and a non-theist campus group together.
###7959 So, Dr. Rosenberg, and there's no name on this, it's the whole group they all decided
###7967 unanimously apparently ... how can the most basic moral values be universal
###7973 if they are determined by natural selection?
###7977 Dr. Rosenberg: That's a question for evolutionary anthropology.
###7985 That is, it's the question ... assume that there are set of moral norms,
###7992 behaviors and values, that are universal that are...
###7996 that obtain in every culture, how could that happen? Well, first of all, the explanandum,
###8003 the proposition describing what is to be explained of course is false.
###8007 And therefore it's difficult to satisfy the request for an explanation.
###8015 It's not the case that there are universal moral values.
###8019 The moral values differ in... on our earth and have overtime owing to important
###8026 ecological differences between the communities that have emerged at various times and various
###8031 places on our planet but now let's just slightly change the question to ...
###8038 in so far as there is a commonality among all human groups in regard to the moral norms
###8047 that they adopt, how could this have emerged as a result of a process of blind variation
###8054 and natural selection?
###8056 So for example, human cooperation, the commitment to fairness and to equality, to reciprocity,
###8066 these are almost all universal. There's only a very small number of societies
###8072 which spurn such moral norms. And why should they have emerged? It's a remarkable
###8078 fact of recent work by evolutionary game theorists and evolutionary anthropologists and others
###8087 that it turns out that cooperation, a commitment to fairness and to equality and to reciprocity,
###8095 turn out for creatures like us who found ourselves at the bottom of the food chain on the African
###8100 savanna 200,000 years ago; to be absolutely required for our survival.
###8108 In fact, it's because we glommed on by pure blind variation, a natural selection to this
###8114 set of norms of cooperation that we manage to climb up the food chain so that within
###8120 a 100,000 years; we were at the top of the food chain everywhere on the planet.
###8126 Our own persistence over that subsequent hundred thousand year period; and our expansion out
###8133 of Africa is largely due to the natural selection for those almost universal norms of cooperation.
###8143 And it's a wonderful thing about us.
###8145 Dr. Craig: I would just say I think the question isn't the universality of these norms but
###8152 their objectivity.
###8154 Dr. Miller: Okay.
###8157 (Audience laughing)
###8159 Dr. Miller: Dr. Craig, this is from Tibor in Town Zilina Slovakia ...
###8169 Slovakia. If the Christian faith is from a realm beyond
###8174 or above reason, like Pauline, peace surpassing understanding...?
###8178 Dr. Craig: It's from Slovakia?
###8179 Could you say that again? I didn't catch it.
###8181 Dr. Miller: If the Christian ... if the Christian faith is from a realm "beyond
###8187 or above reason," like Pauline "Peace surpassing understanding," then how can we even anchor
###8195 such a topic as the reasonableness of believing in God?
###8200 Dr. Craig: God, I would say is beyond human comprehension in the sense that we cannot
###8211 grasp fully God's greatness and majesty. He is not able to be comprehended in that
###8223 universal sense, but that doesn't in anyway imply that we get no elements of truth about
###8229 God.
###8229 I would say that in fact, God is the ultimate rational being.
###8234 He is the ultimate rational mind and we as finite minds, made in His image, are able
###8239 to know a great deal of truth and a great deal about Him even if such knowledge is not
###8245 exhaustive.
###8246 Dr. Miller: Tibori you can go to sleep now because it's late there.
###8253 (Audience laughing)
###8256 Okay, Dr. Rosenberg, from Sarah in Seoul, South Korea: "You said God chose it, whatever
###8267 "it" may be, because it was "morally right." Where does the standard for morally right
###8275 and wrong comes from and what is the logical basis for this order?
###8278 Dr. Rosenberg: Well, I don't have the slightest idea, but what I do know is that God's command
###8286 cannot be such a basis. Assume God exists, assume He commanded us
###8291 to obey certain moral norms. The question becomes are those the right moral
###8298 norms simply because He commanded them, holding the threat of hell to our heads or did He
###8305 command them in his wisdom and goodness because they are the moral right ones?
###8310 The answer that we all agreed to is the latter that he chose them for us because there are
###8315 the morally right ones and it can't be rocket science what makes them morally right; it's
###8320 not like interpretation of quantum mechanics. We all know what makes the morally right values
###8328 morally right. It's not merely the fact that God chose them.
###8334 He chose them because they were the moral right ones.
###8338 And therefore you cannot argue for God's existence from the existence of morally right norms,
###8348 but what the origin, what the basis of moral objectivity is, is not a question to which
###8356 I have at this time a satisfactory answer. Of course as I ...
###8361 and it pains to point out, that's not a material question in this discussion.
###8367 Dr. Craig: I think this is one of the most powerful arguments for the existence of God
###8375 and rooting moral values and duties in God can take either two forms.
###8381 Dr. Rosenberg alluded to one form which is called volunteerism, which is what Ockham
###8387 held and that is that God just makes up moral duties and responsibilities for.
###8394 They're based in His will, but that's not the majority mainstream Christian position.
###8399 Volunteerism is not the usual way divine command morality works.
###8404 The majority position would be that God Himself is what Plato called the good.
###8410 God himself is the paradigm of goodness. His commands are reflections of his own character,
###8417 so it's not that God commands things because they're right independently of Him, that there's
###8422 some good outside of God to which he is subservient, rather God is the good and His commandments
###8430 are reflections of that good character toward us.
###8433 And so, they're not arbitrary but neither are they based on something independent of
###8438 God. I think this gives a very credible foundation
###8442 for moral obligation and prohibition as well as moral value which the atheist cannot provide.
###8450 Dr. Rosenberg: And I think it's just the ... "the assertion that God is good because God
###8454 is good" without adding any content to found, to ground, to substantiate the claim.
###8462 So, God... God's goodness cannot consist in his obeying
###8466 his own moral norms because God could not disobey them.
###8471 It makes no sense to say that his goodness consist in his obeying his own moral norms,
###8478 not to mention that in the Old and New Testament, he doesn't do it very often, but that's another
###8482 matter.
###8483 The real problem is if you assert that it's God's goodness in which the foundation of
###8490 the moral norms consists, then you have to go on and say unless you think it's like quantum
###8494 mechanics, what is that goodness consists in.
###8496 If you simply say, "It's God's goodness because he is good", that's not an answer to the question.
###8501 We need some content to the claim that his goodness grounds the objectivity, the rightness;
###8509 the correctness of the moral norms, and merely saying, "He's good" over and over again doesn't
###8514 do it. This is the open question argument in meta-ethics
###8518 and it dogs divine command theory just as fully as it dogs as it daunts utilitarianism,
###8526 or Kant, or social contract theory, or ideal observer ethics.
###8532 Dr. Craig: Yes, I don't think that that's an insuperable problem.
###8537 God by his very nature is the greatest conceivable being.
###8540 He is a being that is worthy of worship and only a being which is perfect goodness can
###8546 be worthy of worship, and the greatest conceivable being would not simply be good by conforming
###8551 to some other standard. He would be the paradigm of goodness.
###8555 He would be like the old meter bar in Paris, which defined what a meter was not by conforming
###8562 to some abstract length, but by being the paradigm of what a meter is.
###8567 It makes no sense to ask, "Why is the meter bar a meter long?" It is the paradigm for
###8573 what that is.
###8574 Similarly God, I would say, as the greatest conceivable being, a being worthy of worship
###8580 is the good and this is defined in terms that of the character quality city has like compassion,
###8585 fairness, love, justice, and so forth. It's not a contentless claim.
###8592 (Audience clapping)
###8595 Dr. Miller: Okay, I f I could have someone bring up to me the results from the three
###8603 voting aspects. We will continue to take questions for another
###8606 10 minutes here while they bring that up and I will share with the audience the conclusions
###8610 of the people.
###8612 Over here for Dr. Craig.
###8613 Speaker 5: Yes Dr. Craig, I just want to know how would you respond to Dr. Rosenberg's argument
###8621 in his concluding statement that science can operate without having to account for God?
###8627 Dr. Craig: That science what?
###8628 Speaker 5: That science can operate without having to account for God or taking account
###8633 for God?
###8633 Dr. Rosenberg: Yes, that God makes no predictive contribution.
###8636 That God makes no predictive contribution.
###8637 Speaker 5: Yes, that's my question.
###8638 Dr. Craig: Yeah, I read his interview in the campus newspaper this morning trying to get
###8645 some clues to what he might say this evening. And I saw this argument about predictability
###8650 and here's what my thoughts on this are. Predictability is just one way to test for
###8657 the truth of a scientific theory. And it's not always useful.
###8662 Some theories for example are empirically equivalent in their predictions.
###8667 For example I mentioned 10 different physical interpretations of quantum mechanics which
###8672 are all empirically equivalent. There are three different interpretations
###8676 of special relativity which are all empirically equivalent and yet they're different, there
###8681 in in each one is a legitimate scientific theory even though they can't be assessed
###8687 based on predictability.
###8689 Other factors then can come into play, things like simplicity, plausibility, degree of 'ad
###8697 hocness', explanatory power. These are other theoretical virtues besides
###8702 predictability that we can use in testing a hypothesis.
###8707 Predictability is especially difficult to apply when you're dealing with a free agent
###8714 rather than with impersonal mechanistic causes, and particularly in God's case, how could
###8721 you predict what God would do? You could predict perhaps if a universe exists then it would
###8729 be fine-tuned for our existence or that if God created a universe, it would likely have
###8735 objective moral values and duties.
###8737 I think you could make that kind of prediction, but how could you predict as a free agent
###8742 whether or not God would create a universe at all? So, instead, I don't think what you
###8748 do is look for predictability. You follow Quine's prescription.
###8753 Remember Quine said, if you could show the indirect explanatory benefit of positing things
###8759 like a creator, then I would joyfully accord them scientific status along with these other
###8766 entities like quarks and black holes.
###8769 And so, I would say that the... theism has explanatory power to offer us.
###8777 For example fine-tuning is more probable on theism than on naturalism.
###8784 States of intentionality are more probable on theism than on naturalism or atheism.
###8791 Objective moral values and duties are more probable on theism than on naturalism.
###8797 The resurrection of Jesus is more probable on theism than on naturalism.
###8802 So, in all of these ways, I think theism is an explanatorily beneficial hypothesis that
###8814 explains a wide range of the data of the human experience which atheism cannot explain.
###8821 Speaker 5: Sounds pretty ad hoc to me. (Laughs).
###8826 Dr. Miller: For Dr. Rosenberg.
###8829 Speaker 6: In your closing argument, you're saying that science is the only way to be
###8835 reasonable. Wouldn't that make history and personal experiences
###8839 unreasonable because they're not repeatable and also everyone in this room because we're
###8843 not repeatable scientifically?
###8845 Dr. Rosenberg: I don't know what it means to say.
###8847 "We are not repeatable scientifically". Everybody in this room has a large number
###8852 of properties in common but they're all shared and that have scientific explanations.
###8857 Everybody in this room differs from everyone else in a variety of different respects and
###8862 those differences are also open to increasingly the subject of scientific explanations with
###8869 substantial, additional, predictive content that certify their improvement over previous
###8877 scientific explanations.
###8880 As for personal experience in history, as we all know and this happens to be my principal
###8889 career interest as a philosopher, the philosophy of social sciences.
###8893 As we all know, there are grave difficulties involved in applying the methods of the natural
###8900 sciences, of the empirical sciences to human questions.
###8904 In many respects, these are submitting of imaginative, interesting and powerful solutions
###8913 as we speak.
###8914 If I'm right, and no one will know if I'm right about this well after all of us in this
###8921 room are dead. If I'm right, eventually the sciences broadly
###8927 understood. Will provide as predictably powerful and therefore
###8931 as explanatorily credible accounts of the nature and character and trajectory of individual
###8937 human lives as they now provide for the planets, but of course I could be wrong.
###8943 It's an empirical question.
###8945 Speaker 6: Thank you.
###8947 Dr. Craig: This is the question of epistemological naturalism that I raised in my second speech.
###8953 Remember I said, "The one reason that's regard of this a false theory of knowledge is because
###8957 it's overly restrictive". In particular, Dr. Rosenberg is very harsh
###8963 in his book on the humanities in terms of the humanities not really being a source of
###8969 knowledge at all, including history.
###8971 And this has led many of the reviewers of Dr. Rosenberg's book to be very critical with
###8977 regard to this narrow scientism that he propounds. For example, Michael Ruse who is an agnostic
###8987 philosopher of science says this, "I think Rosenberg's insensitivity to history blinds
###8993 him to the fact that science does not ask certain questions and so it is no surprise
###8998 that it does not give answers."
###9000 "I'm not at all sure that the theists' answers are correct, but they are not shown to be
###9006 incorrect by modern science. Science is limited in scope and by its very
###9012 nature is destined forever to be limited." So, science may be the best way of getting
###9018 at knowledge of the physical world the way it operates, but there are many other fields
###9024 of knowledge that also are sources of truth and knowledge about the world including mathematics,
###9031 metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, history and so forth.
###9037 Dr. Rosenberg: All I can say is we weren't debating this book; which is not widely available.
###9044 (Laughs). We were debating the reasonableness of the
###9049 belief in God's existence.
###9050 Dr. Craig: Could I ask you a question, Dr. Rosenberg? Given the debate question tonight,
###9058 is faith in God reasonable? I thought and anticipated that you would say much more about
###9066 your defensive scientism because it seems to me that that's the principle reason that
###9073 you are skeptical about the existence of God.
###9078 And so, I'm curious why didn't you make this more of an issue in tonight's debate? That
###9084 would show God and faith in God to be unreasonable if scientism or epistemological naturalism
###9090 were true or metaphysical naturalism, I'm sorry, I meant to say.
###9095 Dr. Rosenberg: I wrote this book because I was relatively disenchanted with the tide
###9100 of works by Hitchens, and Dawkins, and Harris. Here I exclude Dan Dennett, who's book the
###9108 Breaking the Spell is quite in order ... a different order of magnitude.
###9111 I was rather tired of books hammering another nail into the coffin of theism.
###9118 I'm much more eager to put before a public that might be interested in the real implications
###9127 of science for the perennial questions of philosophy for what a radio humorist named
###9132 Garrison Keillor calls the persistent questions that bother that guy in the 14th floor of
###9136 the Acme Building in St. Paul, Minnesota, the guy that was excluded
###9141 from referring to by my editor because he said nobody ever heard of Garrison Keillor.
###9146 (Audience laughing).
###9150 I was interested in exploring what the consequences of science were for these fundamental questions
###9155 of philosophy that keep us up at night. Right? What I said at the beginning of this
###9161 book is science gives us the best argument for atheism and it's so good that I don't
###9167 have to rehearse it in this book. I want to go on and talk about all the other
###9172 things that those of us who are atheists because we believe that science describes the nature
###9179 of reality, ought to believe.
###9181 Now, I don't think that in a discussion about atheism, the further consequences of science
###9189 which I claim to obtain are relevant or material. And I certainly know, and I'm sure you will
###9195 agree with me, that those who reject these conclusions can do so by saying they don't
###9202 follow from science. Of course I take it that on your own view
###9210 either these conclusions do follow from science and therefore my book is vindicated as an
###9215 account of how science deals with the perennial questions that keep us all up at night, or
###9221 else you've committed a flagrant logical fallacy of affirming the consequent.
###9227 Dr. Craig: No, what I said was it doesn't follow from epistemological naturalism, but
###9232 I do agree with you that your conclusions follow from metaphysical naturalism and that
###9239 ...
###9239 Dr. Rosenberg: No, my argument is not they follow from metaphysical naturalism.
###9241 My argument is they follow from the substantive claims of the sciences, physics, chemistry,
###9246 biology, neuroscience ...
###9247 Dr. Craig: Yes, I disagree ...
###9248 Dr. Rosenberg: It's not philosophy that I am deducing these consequences from.
###9254 It's science and of course we can argue about that.
###9256 Dr. Craig: Yes, I disagree with that part, but where I agreed with you in contrast to
###9261 the Dawkins and the Hitchens and Dennett and others, where I agreed with you was that if
###9268 only physical things exist, if physics fixes all the facts as you put it, then it seems
###9274 to me you're right, there isn't any intentional states and there aren't any meaning to sentences,
###9280 there is no truth.
###9281 Dr. Rosenberg: Yes, could I get you to write a blurb for the back of my book?
###9285 Dr. Craig: Somebody ... somebody on Facebook said, why have a debate
###9288 between Craig and Rosenberg, they both agree on the consequences of denying God and so
###9296 he thought it would be pointless, but I mean it drives you back to the question, well is
###9299 there a God? It's metaphysical naturalism.
###9301 Dr. Rosenberg: Maybe there's a chance for my book to be in the Christian bookstores
###9305 after all?
###9306 Dr. Craig: Yes. (Laughing).
###9310 (Audience clapping).
###9312 Dr. Miller: On that note, let's (laughing) two more questions here.
###9318 I'm going to go right back to you Dr. Rosenberg and then will take one from this side because
###9323 this is an interesting ...
###9324 Dr. Rosenberg: You know Corey I've been asking you to call me Alex all day (laughs).
###9327 Dr. Miller: But you also wanted me to call you Dr. Rosenberg and that Rosenberg like
###9331 in a football game. (Laughing).
###9334 Okay, Alex (Laughing). Gabriel Sotto from Costa Rica: Let's assume
###9342 that God does not exist and you were right, then what is your explanation for the existence
###9347 of evil if there is no evil and good?
###9350 Dr. Rosenberg: Of course my explanation ... the explanation that I offer in this book
###9361 not to put too fine a point on it, isn't an explanation of evil because that would commit
###9366 me to a normative theory which I am unprepared to endorse, but I have an explanation for
###9375 suffering, for the pain and misery of human existence and of other biological systems.
###9384 And regrettably, it has to do with the nature of matter and the nature of the struggle for
###9392 survival and the competition among physical systems including biological systems and animals
###9399 and us for survival; and the fact that nature has so organized living matter as to provide
###9409 it with signals when it's doing something that's dangerous for its persistence and its
###9414 well-being by giving it pain. Right?
###9419 Now, I don't think it's a great mystery why physical systems...
###9423 why biological system should feel ... have sensations in particular sensations of
###9428 pain and discomfort. Those are signals that nature is providing
###9433 or they are the byproducts of signals that nature is providing about the threats to one's
###9440 well-being. That's about the best I think we can do by
###9444 way of explaining, "Why there is suffering?" Okay? Giving a scientific and empirical, a
###9451 factual explanation for why there is suffering as opposed to theological explanation for
###9456 why there is suffering.
###9457 Dr. Miller: Dr. Craig do you care to respond to that or just ...
###9457 Dr. Craig: No comment.
###9458 Dr. Miller: Let's take one last question on this side to Dr. Craig.
###9465 Speaker 7: Yes my question is for Dr. Craig. The Bible says that Jesus loves us, wants
###9472 a relationship with us and wants us to believe in Him.
###9475 He even showed himself to disbelievers like you mentioned to people such as Thomas after
###9481 he was crucified to help them believe. My question is why does Jesus not continue
###9485 to physically reveal himself to people particularly unbelievers to show them that He is real?
###9491 Dr. Craig: Yes. Obviously God could make his existence or
###9495 Christ's existence more evident than he has. He could have the stars spell out "God exists"
###9503 in the sky or he could have every atom inscribed with the label "made by God".
###9509 Clearly, God could make his existence a lot more obvious, but I think what the point you
###9516 were making is the salient one. God isn't interested in just getting people
###9521 to believe that he exists to add one more piece of furniture to their ontology of the
###9527 universe.
###9528 He wants to bring people into a loving, saving relationship with himself.
###9533 I think that God in his providence knows how to so order the world so as to bring the maximal
###9541 or optimal number of people freely into relationship with himself.
###9546 He knows that it isn't necessary or profitable to have Jesus of Nazareth appear miraculously
###9554 to every single person in his lifetime in order to provide sufficient grace for salvation
###9559 to everybody.
###9560 In fact, it's possible that in a world in which God's existence was as plain as the
###9566 nose on your face in which Jesus was constantly appearing in people's bedrooms, that they
###9572 would get rather annoyed at the effrontery of this intruder, popping into their houses
###9578 all the time uninvited, and wouldn't lead at all to a deeper faith or love in Him.
###9583 So, I think that we can trust God's wisdom in providentially ordering the world in such
###9589 a way that people are given adequate but not coercive evidence for his existence and the
###9596 question then for us is how will we respond to that.
###9599 It's not an adequate response to complain that you want more evidence.
###9603 You need to look at the evidence that you do have and to make a decision on that basis,
###9610 but I don't think that... there's any reason here to think that God
###9617 would do what you suggest, it may be that that would do nothing in terms of bringing
###9625 a greater number of people into a saving relationship with Himself.
###9630 (Audience clapping).
###9632 Dr. Miller: Give one last question for Dr. Rosenberg and then we will give you the results
###9639 of the vote and close out.
###9642 Speaker 8: Dr. Rosenberg, I wonder if you might help me to understand how your view
###9648 is not incoherent. Do you really claim in your book that sentences
###9654 have no meaning or truth value; even the sentences in your own book? How is that not incoherent
###9661 and self-refuting? At least the sentences you've made tonight surely you think are true,
###9671 but if even you don't think that your position is true, why should we?
###9679 Dr. Rosenberg: Two paragraphs from the last page of the chapter of my book entitled The
###9691 Brain Does Everything without Thinking about Anything at All.
###9694 Of course this is at the end of a long chapter in which I've talked about neuroscience, Nobel
###9702 Prize Winning Research by Erick Kandel, the wonderful IBM computer Watson that beats us
###9710 at Jeopardy and about the best semantic and Philosophical Theories of Intentionality.
###9720 Pardon me for reading. "Introspection is screaming that thought has
###9724 to be about stuff and philosophers and you are muttering, denying it is crazy worse than
###9730 self-contradictory, it's incoherent. According to you Rosenberg neither spoken
###9734 sentences nor silent ones in thought express statements, they aren't about anything that
###9739 goes for every sentence in this book, it's not about anything.
###9743 Why are we bothering to read it?" It's not as if I haven't figured it out that this is
###9747 an issue that is raised by science and in this chapter.
###9753 Now, I'll read you the last paragraph, "Look, if I am going to get scientism into your skull
###9759 I have to use the only tools we've got for moving information from one head to another:
###9765 noises, ink-marks, pixels. Treat the illusions that go with them like
###9770 the optical illusions of the previous chaptr." A chapter in which I said don't trust consciousness,
###9775 because it's mainly mistaken. "This book isn't conveying statements.
###9781 It's rearranging neural circuits, removing inaccurate disinformation and replacing it
###9786 with accurate information. Treat it as correcting maps instead of erasing
###9791 sentences." Now, there is a big business in philosophy about the nature of semantics and
###9798 about the how intentionality's realized.
###9801 I ain't so stupid as to contradict myself in the puerile way that you're suggesting,
###9807 okay? What you got to do is read the book to figure out the answer and send me an email
###9812 and I'll send you a really long and hard paper called the Eliminativism Without Tears, which
###9817 I have written to try to give a detailed account of why it is that we can still make sense
###9824 to one another in spite of the fact that neuroscience shows that intentionality is just an overlay
###9832 like so much of the rest of our common sense views about reality; including the belief
###9838 that Europe is still standing because things just fall directly to the ground.
###9845 (Audience clapping)
###9848 Dr. Miller: Very good. Well, let me go ahead and read these tallies
###9855 and close us out. It's not a scientific result here, but we've
###9861 got three interesting results nonetheless from across section of audiences, our formal
###9866 judge team, our Purdue audience, and across the web nationally and internationally.
###9873 So, for the formal judging, in a four to two decision our judging panel has identified
###9880 Dr. Craig is the winner of this evening's debate.
###9887 (Audience clapping). For the local result from Purdue, we have
###9901 no vote at all 112 and on by far most people did not vote, half didn't vote, it appears
###9909 they didn't even write cards. Sheesh! Dr. Rosenberg has 303 and Dr. Craig
###9914 1,390. (Audience clapping).
###9925 Online vote, it appears that Dr. Craig has 734 and Dr. Rosenberg 59.
###9933 (Audience clapping).
###9935 So, for whatever its worth, so let's go ahead and close this out.
###9941 These gentlemen are very enlightening people, fun to hang out with, and they're going to
###9947 stick around for another half an hour to answer questions that people perhaps come up and
###9953 talk with them.
###9955 As someone who loves ... this may sound morbid ...
###9958 but loves to visit cemeteries; I do it every time I go to a new town for historical imagination,
###9964 I've mentioned this many times before and I'm still eager to find this, if someone knows
###9969 of this cemetery with a tomb stone with a particular epitaph on it, I will pay money.
###9975 It reads this way, "Pause, stranger, when you pass me by: As you are now, so once was
###9981 I. As I am now, so you will be, so prepare for
###9985 death and follow me."
###9988 And somebody came by philosophic, probably a skeptic or something like that and wrote,
###9994 "To follow you, I'm not content until I know which way you went." (Laughing).
###10001 (Audience clapping)
###10007 We do thank you for coming and watching the live stream tonight.
