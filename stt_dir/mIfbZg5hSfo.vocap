###35 Bugger. Bugger.
###38 Yep, yep. I'm coming, I'm coming.
###41 I'm coming, all right?
###43 Pain in the arse!
###45 - Where are you off to? - I'm going to yoga.
###48 Oh, I've often wondered...
###50 - What? - Don't start.
###53 - Eva says I'm stressed. - What does Eva know about stress?
###57 - She has three kids. - We've all got three kids.
###59 - At least she's doing something. - Oi, Thor, get on with it.
###64 I'm only doing it once to shut her up.
###66 I've got to go, I'm late. I'm always late.
###68 Fags.
###76 W-Why have you moved everything on my desk? Where's my lighter?
###80 Bills. Lots of bills.
###83 Our solicitor sent her solicitor a letter and his solicitor is billing us for it.
###87 - Are you making coffee or not? - We need some decent stock.
###91 Stop, Mother of God, go and get your hair done!
###94 The boiler sounds like it's giving birth,
###97 you still haven't taken your encyclopedias out of the bath.
###101 I want a herb garden.
###103 What's the matter with you? Where's my lighter?
###106 Fran is coming to dinner, I have to cook, clean, run the shop,
###110 - do the dusting, tidy... - Excuse me.
###113 - Just tell me where it is. - Excuse me?
###115 - What? What? - Do you have any Adam Phillips?
###117 How would I know? Go to a proper book shop.
###120 Look, I didn't come in here to be insulted.
###124 Well, I didn't ask for the job of insulting you.
###128 You know, in another life, maybe we could have been brothers,
###131 running a small, quirky taverna in Sicily.
###134 Maybe we would have married the local twins
###137 instead of wasting each other's time in this dump.
###140 But it was not to be, so...
###144 hop it.
###147 Manny, I'm being calm,
###148 I am asking you for the last time, where is my...
###151 Who does all the shopping? Me. All the cooking? Me.
###154 Who gets all the stock? Me.
###156 Who went without so you had a hot breakfast? Me.
###158 Look, there is your lighter there, next to your cigarettes.
###162 On the desk which I tidied earlier. Enjoy your bacon roll.
###169 Why do you always have to make the bacon so curly?
###172 Right! That's it, I quit.
###175 You quit every day. I'm going out now for some peace.
###179 I suggest when you reapply for the job in about half an hour
###183 you do the interview yourself.
###185 Why not wear your pinstripe suit, the one that gives you a big arse?
###189 You like the look of yourself in that.
###197 Every bloody day...
###198 - (Door opens) - I don't know why I bother.
###201 (Sighs deeply)
###203 You interested in these?
###206 Freud?
###208 - Complete set? - Yeah. Load of rubbish, really.
###211 Don't try and push me.
###213 Condition OK.
###215 Bit scuffed.
###217 20 quid.
###218 - That's fine... - All right, 25. That's it.
###221 - Great, they're all yours... - 30. 35.
###224 All right, 40 is my final offer.
###227 50 quid. That's all they're worth.
###230 - All right! 60, yeah? - Great.
###236 Here's the money. And, er...
###238 here's a tenner for the taxi.
###243 That looks good.
###251 - Hey, hey! - What?
###253 Brown sauce?
###257 (Birdsong)
###263 - Told you so. - It's amazing.
###266 If I was any more relaxed you could just...
###268 - (Mobile) ...pour me into a bowl.
###276 Look at you smiling away.
###278 - (Giggles) - See?
###280 You don't need horrible cigarettes and gallons of booze just to feel normal.
###286 - Is this normal? - Yes!
###288 That's what I'm telling you.
###290 You change when you drink, you're so loud.
###293 You sit there with a fag, cackling like something out of a brothel.
###297 God, I don't. How horrible.
###299 And when you're drunk, the way you eat and swear...
###304 Suddenly crying and then singing and kissing terrible men.
###308 I know, I know, I'm awful.
###310 I worry you'll end up with a head full of gold teeth
###313 roaring over a vegetable stall someplace.
###316 - I'm not that... - Come over for the next set of exercises.
###320 - We can have carrot juice. - Carrot juice!
###325 What? No, yes, I'd love to.
###327 - Definitely, great. - I'll see you then.
###332 You know, I've never told you but all those fags and booze make you reek.
###338 - What? D-Do I? - Stinky-poos.
###341 No more smoking and drinking with those two layabouts.
###344 No, no-no, I won't.
###359 Excuse me, can I get...?
###365 Where were you? I called you for ages. Manny is driving me nuts.
###369 That's because he's got pressure on his meridian lines.
###373 Which...? Excuse me, c-could I...?
###376 Do I smell or what?
###378 (Sniffs) Yes, because you're full of things that are bad for you.
###382 What? Listen, he's making me miserable.
###385 You are miserable because you are always guzzling, gulping or puffing.
###390 What's wrong with you? I'm talking about Manny.
###393 You know, the fruit storm I happen to live with.
###396 - I want a drink. - You always want something.
###399 In Tibet, if they want something, know what they do?
###402 - They give something away. - Do they? Do they?
###405 That must be why they're such a dominant global power.
###408 Excuse me!
###410 You should stop smoking and drinking. I haven't had anything for two hours.
###414 - Why not? - Yoga.
###416 Don't mess around with that stuff. I read it's very dangerous.
###420 It's amazing. It's like having sunshine in your veins.
###424 Here we go, Mary Poppins.
###426 It is a shame the way people pollute themselves.
###429 I mean, look around you. Just look, what do you see?
###433 I see intelligent, attractive people
###435 who smoke and drink all the time and never get sick or die.
###438 Or bore the bollocks off their friends.
###441 Excuse...!
###444 This is pointless. I'll see you at dinner, which he is making a big deal out of.
###449 You are being irrational. The only way to inner peace...
###453 Stop talking goo.
###455 The only thing that will bring me inner peace is a beard-seeking missile.
###465 (# Manny humming)
###468 (Footsteps on stairs)
###472 Are you trying to kill me? You left a box of books on the stairs.
###476 Sorry I bought something that will actually sell.
###479 - What? What is it? - Freud, complete works.
###482 Drivel. A waste of money.
###487 So what kind of filth is spewing out of your hatch tonight?
###492 Mini medleys of chicken with summer berries.
###494 You know I hate student food.
###497 To start, and then daube of Argentinian lamb
###500 with a julienne of red roots, celeriac mash and salsa verde.
###505 I bet you forgot to buy the plonk.
###507 The wines will be a Tavel, followed by Primitiva or Navarra.
###512 Well, I want a drink now!
###515 There's the two litres of your Spanish antifreeze.
###518 Let me know when you want your food chewed.
###523 - I'll wait till you put your teeth in, dear. - Don't start...
###528 Oh, isn't this nice?
###537 What were those funny-coloured things?
###539 Vegetables.
###541 You know I'm allergic to vegetables. You are trying to kill me.
###545 Excuse me.
###549 - (Slams plates down) - What's the matter with him?
###552 His energy centres are misaligned.
###554 - Oh, Christ! - And you're feeling like this because...
###558 I feel like this because he never thinks of anyone but himself.
###562 - Fran, I've made something for you. - Oh, Manny.
###566 It's your favourite - rum and chocolate.
###570 - Oh... - Oh, yes, kissy-kissy. Ugh.
###573 I can't really have any.
###575 - I'm avoiding all stimulants. - Oh, listen to you!
###578 You're becoming one of them, going to the other side.
###581 The land of sandals, spoon-benders and yogurt-fanciers.
###585 Everybody farts a lot because they don't know how to laugh.
###589 Everyone should meditate.
###591 Oh, let's, then we can all make some tofu
###594 for the dolphins who live in the fridge.
###597 Fran is trying to improve her life, you could support her.
###600 It's shite. Like the Freud. How did you price that rubbish?
###605 I didn't. I was... (Kicks table)... cooking!
###607 How very convenient to leave all the back-breaking labour to me.
###615 Yoga. Freud. (Scoffs)
###618 Fran, I need to talk to you.
###619 He treats me like a child. I can't cope.
###622 He eats all the sweets, he says they'll make my hair fall out.
###625 I found a baby monitor under my bed.
###628 - We'll sort it out right now. - What will we do?
###631 - Close your eyes. - God, Fran...
###633 (Fran) And keep them closed. Take a deep breath.
###636 Stick out your tongue and roll your head.
###639 Ahhh-uhhh.
###641 Bluhhh...
###649 "The psychopathology of the inverted sociopath."
###652 (Continues droning)
###654 This is all about him.
###661 Mania.
###664 And relax. Now fold your arms.
###667 And sway them gently.
###671 That's it.
###674 Mother complex.
###676 He's got the lot!
###680 OK, and raise your head...
###682 and open your eyes.
###690 - Now, doesn't that feel better? - Yes.
###694 But he's becoming impossible. Look, he hasn't left anything for us.
###698 (Belches)
###702 (# Whistling merrily)
###705 - Breakfast! - What?
###707 Ow! (Groaning)
###710 - What's happened? What is it? - (Stammering)
###713 - Hang on. - (Screams)
###717 Take that one, oh, erm... Vitamin C?
###720 - Ow! - Nasal spray?
###722 Fungicide.
###727 What's this?
###732 Why did you do that?
###734 - So you could use the towel. - Oh, you're insane.
###737 Get out.
###751 Jam.
###756 According to Freud it's dangerous even to be in the same room as you.
###760 We'll have to replace all our cutlery with plastic.
###764 And then I want to get you electronically tagged.
###766 Bernard, pass the butter, please.
###769 - This? - No, that.
###771 - What did you say? - I said, "No, that."
###773 You said, "No, Dad."
###777 There you go again, projecting.
###780 I wish I'd never bought the stupid books. I'm not projecting.
###783 I've never seen such projecting.
###785 It's in CinemaScope with Dolby Surround.
###789 You're deranged. You need help.
###791 - I'm normal. - Normal?
###793 What other grown man makes soldiers for his runny egg
###797 and then divides them into rank?
###799 - Just a bit of fun. - Yeah?
###801 - So I can eat this one? - Don't touch the colonel!
###804 It'll upset the rest of the men.
###807 Call a shrink, you're nuts.
###810 And so is your whole platoon.
###815 (# New age)
###816 - (Eva) Breathe in. - (Laboured rasp)
###819 - And breathe out. - (Heavy rasp)
###821 And come down. (Exhales deeply)
###827 And then raise your hands up and say, "Hello!"
###831 - To the sun. - (Strained) Hello, sun.
###834 - You don't actually say it. - It's not even sunny.
###837 (Exhales sharply)
###839 Hey...
###840 do you fancy some toast?
###842 Wheat is poison.
###844 I can't believe you had chocolate.
###847 You didn't have meat, did you?
###848 No! No, no, no, no.
###853 Well, just a little bit of chicken.
###856 And a few specks of lamb.
###858 Fran, we're going to have to fix you.
###861 Your chakras will be all clogged.
###866 - (Inhales sharply) - Eva, do you, erm...
###869 - do you ever get a bit bored... - (Exhales sharply)
###872 ...erm... f-feeling this good all the time?
###877 I'm going to ignore that.
###879 That's the toxins in you talking. Come on, I'll centre your yang.
###886 Ah, right. How about a special treat?
###889 Is it that carrot thing again?
###892 Come on. I'm not a total killjoy, you know.
###894 You sit tight and I'll rustle us up some naughty rice cakes.
###919 Here we are. Yummy!
###929 (# Humming cheerily)
###936 (Chuckles)
###939 (# Hums The Stripper)
###964 (Stops humming)
###968 - What are you doing? - Stripping the chicken.
###971 - What for? - I could make soup, salad, sandwiches.
###975 Or a chicken cravat but it's just hassle. We'll get a takeaway.
###979 - Loads I could do with this. - It's a chicken!
###982 Chicken is finite.
###984 You've got to move on. What if somebody dies?
###987 - I'll use the legs. It's thrifty. - It's disgusting.
###990 This is how Jeffrey Dahmer and that lot get started.
###994 You can't let go. Old boxes of fried chicken lying around.
###997 Then a friend says, "I have to leave town," and...
###1000 (Imitates chainsaw) Out with the Black & Decker.
###1003 Bits of him lying around like nibbles.
###1005 - You've got to see a shrink. - Have a wing.
###1008 It's crunchy.
###1011 Can't you see you're not right?
###1017 (Inhaling and exhaling)
###1020 So I made him an appointment.
###1022 Can you imagine what the analyst is finding in that horrible head of his?
###1027 (Stops exhaling abruptly)
###1032 If you two could do something relaxing together things wouldn't be so tense.
###1037 What? Every time we bicker we should have sex?
###1040 Just have a drink and be yourself again.
###1043 So what's it's like, then? Fags and booze?
###1047 To be honest, after years of smoking and drinking
###1051 you do sometimes look at yourself and think...
###1053 Yep.
###1055 In between the first cigarette with coffee in the morning
###1058 to that 400th glass of corner-shop piss at 3am,
###1062 you do sometimes look at yourself and think...
###1064 Yep.
###1068 "This is fantastic.
###1070 "I'm in heaven."
###1075 Obviously, I'm very grateful for the job, erm...
###1079 and I don't think he's fundamentally a bad person...
###1087 Well, I suppose he might be.
###1090 I mean, it's not a bad life after all.
###1092 Obviously, there's the cooking, the cleaning,
###1095 doing the accounts, making the cheese, scraping the beds.
###1099 But you know, l-I'm happy, really.
###1105 Yes, you're right, you're right. I'm being exploited.
###1109 (Sighs) It's about self-respect, isn't it?
###1114 Isn't it?
###1116 Exactly! Exactly. I must stand my ground.
###1120 Brilliant. Thank you so much for your help.
###1123 Cheque all right?
###1134 The service in this place. Erm, excuse me...
###1138 Sorry, excu-excu...
###1140 - Is something wrong with me? - Hm.
###1143 (Authoritatively) Service.
###1145 (Silence falls)
###1151 Yes, sir?
###1152 - Two cappuccinos, chocolate cake. - Straightaway, sir.
###1158 - Wow. - This therapy might have helped.
###1161 - You are the king! - There is a touch of the king.
###1168 On the house, sir. Sorry for the delay.
###1174 - King of kings! - (Chuckles)
###1176 When the other kings don't know what to do they call you.
###1179 The royal line does ring from time to time.
###1182 - Oh, won't he be surprised? - Who?
###1184 - Bernard. - Oh, yes.
###1188 Him.
###1203 Where have you been?
###1207 - Talking to me? - You look different. Are you on steroids?
###1211 What are you talking about, you silly little man?
###1214 Now, look here...
###1216 Shouldn't you be serving a customer or something?
###1220 And isn't it about time you had a really good scrub?
###1224 It's not my fault I look like this. You haven't washed my things.
###1227 Ah. We can't blame others for our appearance, can we?
###1231 No, no, no, but...
###1234 I suggest you wash your own socks, if you can chisel them out of your shoes.
###1238 I'm going for a nap and I don't want to be disturbed.
###1242 How dare you speak to me like that! My own son.
###1249 What did you say?
###1251 Nothing. Nothing.
###1257 It's as Freud says. You know, the unconscious thing.
###1262 Superego, something, something...
###1264 That's exactly what he's like.
###1268 It's not as if he's never rewarded.
###1271 Maybe not in any material way...
###1273 or any other way, but still.
###1280 I may have been a little hard on him.
###1283 But he leaves boxes in the hall! I nearly tripped and...
###1290 Yes, yes, I'm a monster, I know, it's not his fault,
###1293 I'm a terrible bastard.
###1294 Yes, right, thanks for your help, bye.
###1299 One complete set of Freud, £200, thank you.
###1305 - (Door opens and closes) - Manny?
###1308 Your wages. Sorry they're late.
###1310 Oh, thanks. Er, I was just going to get us some lunch.
###1314 No, no. I've done that.
###1318 - That's awfully kind of you. - Manny!
###1321 It's nothing. You're welcome, it's nothing.
###1327 Wa-hey!
###1330 Go on! Give him a kiss! Go on!
###1337 - You're pissed. - (Giggles)
###1340 Yeah, I know.
###1344 Come on, open the bootle.
###1347 What? What are you looking at? Oh, oh...
###1351 I cracked, didn't I?
###1353 Eva said I had to give up milk and peas and God knows what.
###1357 What's wrong with fucking peas?
###1360 I told her she could stuff it up her chakras.
###1364 And now she's not talking to me.
###1366 Come on, open the bloody wine.
###1369 Go on, Manny, get a move on.
###1371 - Please. - What?
###1373 Wouldn't kill you to say please.
###1375 You know what, I'm going to have you spayed.
###1378 Go on, Manny, resign. Again. Go on.
###1381 - I am. I resign. - I've had enough, I'm going out.
###1385 Yeah, go on, I'll mind the shop for you. I can be both of you.
###1389 "Bernard, Bernard, it's not fair. Bernard, here's your tea.
###1393 "Oh, Bernard, can I have my pocket money?"
###1395 "Oh, Manny, for the last time, shut up!
###1399 "Mother of God, I think I'm going to kill ya."
###1409 - Now, that is mad. - (Belches)
