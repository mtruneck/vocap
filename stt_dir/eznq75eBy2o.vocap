###12 Professor Paul Bloom: So, most of what we do these
###14 days – our methods, our theories,
###16 our ideas – are shaped, to some extent,
###17 by Piaget's influence. And so, what I want to do is
###21 begin this class that's going to talk about cognitive development
###25 by talking about his ideas. His idea was that children are
###29 active thinkers; they're trying to figure out
###32 the world. He often described them as
###34 little scientists. And incidentally,
###37 to know where he's coming from on this, he had a very dramatic
###44 and ambitious goal. He didn't start off because he
###48 was interested in children. He started off because he was
###51 interested in the emergence of knowledge in general.
###54 It was a discipline he described as genetic
###57 epistemology – the origins of knowledge.
###61 But he studied development of the individual child because he
###64 was convinced that this development will tell him about
###67 the development of knowledge more generally.
###70 There's a very snooty phrase that--I don't know if you ever
###73 heard it before. It's a great phrase.
###75 It's "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny."
###79 And the idea of this--What that means is that development of an
###83 individual mimics or repeats development of the species.
###88 Now, it's entirely not true, but it's a beautiful phrase and
###92 Piaget was committed to this. He was very interested in
###95 saying, "Look. We'll figure how a kid develops
###97 and that will tell us about the development of knowledge more
###101 generally." So, Piaget viewed the child as
###104 a scientist who developed this understanding,
###107 these schemas, these little,
###109 miniature theories of the world.
###112 And they did this through two sorts of mechanisms:
###116 assimilation and accommodation. So, assimilation would be the
###121 act of expanding the range of things that you respond to.
###126 Piaget's example would be a baby who's used to sucking on a
###130 breast might come to suck on a bottle or on a rattle.
###134 That's changing the scope of things that you respond to.
###139 Accommodation is changing how you do it.
###143 A baby will form his mouth differently depending on what
###146 he's sucking on. And so, these processes where
###149 you take in--I'm giving this in a very physical way,
###154 but in a more psychological sense you have a way of looking
###156 at the world. You could expand it to
###158 encompass new things, assimilation.
###161 But you could also change your system of knowledge itself –
###165 accommodation. And Piaget argued that these
###168 two mechanisms of learning drove the child through different
###172 stages. And he had a stage theory,
###175 which was quite different from the Freudian stage theory that
###178 we have been introduced to. So his methods were to ask
###182 children to solve problems and to ask them questions.
###187 And his discoveries that--they did them in different ways at
###190 different ages led to the emergence of the Stage Theory.
###194 So, for Piaget, the first stage is the
###199 sensorimotor stage or the sensorimotor period.
###204 For here the child is purely a physical creature.
###211 The child has no understanding in any real way of the external
###215 world. There's no understanding of the
###218 past, no understanding of the future, no stability,
###221 no differentiation. The child just touches and
###225 sees, but doesn't yet reason.
###228 
###232 And it's through this stage that a child gradually comes to
###236 acquire object permanence.
###237 
###240 Object permanence is the understanding that things exist
###245 when you no longer see them. So those of you in front,
###249 you're looking at me and I go. It occurred to me it'd be a
###254 great magic trick if I then appeared in back.
###256 But no, I'm just here. That's object permanence.
###259 If I went under here and then the people said,
###263 "Where the hell did he go? Class is over," that would show
###267 a lack of object permanence. So, adults have object
###271 permanence. Piaget's very interesting claim
###275 is that kids don't. Before six-month-olds,
###279 Piaget observed, you take an object the kid
###282 likes like a rattle, you hide it,
###284 you put it behind something, it's like it's gone.
###288 And he claimed the child really thinks it's just gone.
###292 Things don't continue to exist when I'm not looking at them
###295 anymore. And so he noticed they--they're
###298 surprised by peek-a-boo. And Piaget's claim was one
###301 reason why they're surprised at peek-a-boo is you go--you look
###304 at a kid, the kid's smiling and go,
###306 "Oh, peek-a-boo," and you close--and you cover your face
###308 and the kid says, "He's gone."
###310 "Peek-a-boo." "Oh, there he is.
###313 He's gone." And you really--That's the
###317 claim. Piaget also discovered that
###320 older children fail at a task that's known as the A-not-B
###325 task. And Peter Gray in his
###327 psychology textbook refers to it as the "changing hiding places"
###331 problem, which is probably a better name for it.
###335 And here's the idea. You take a nine-month-old and
###338 for Piaget a nine-month-old is just starting to make sense of
###341 objects and their permanence. You take an object and you put
###346 it here in a cup where the kid can't see it,
###349 but it's in the cup. So the kid, if you were the
###352 kid, will reach for it. You do it again, reach for it.
###355 You do it again, reach for it. That's point A.
###357 Then you take--you move it over here.
###361 Piaget observed kids would still reach for this.
###363 It's like they're not smart enough to figure out that it's
###366 not there anymore, even if they see it move.
###369 And this was more evidence that they just don't understand
###373 objects, and that this thing takes a lot of time and learning
###377 to develop. The next stage is the
###380 preoperational stage. The child starts off grasping
###384 the world only in a physical way, in a sensorimotor way,
###389 but when he gets to the preoperational period the
###391 capacity to represent the world, to have the world inside your
###396 head, comes into being. But it's limited and it's
###400 limited in a couple of striking ways.
###403 One way in which it's limited is that children are egocentric.
###408 Now, egocentrism has a meaning in common English which means to
###413 be selfish. Piaget meant it in a more
###415 technical way. He claimed that children at
###418 this age literally can't understand that others can see
###421 the world differently from them. So, one of his demonstrations
###426 was the three mountains task. We have three mountains over
###429 there. You put a child on one side of
###431 the mountains and you ask him to draw it, and a four- or
###435 five-year-old can do it easily, but then you ask him to draw it
###439 as it would appear from the other side and children find
###443 this extraordinarily difficult. They find it very difficult to
###447 grasp the world as another person might see it.
###451 Another significant finding Piaget had about this phase of
###456 development concerns what's called "conservation."
###461 The notion of conservation is that there's ways to transform
###466 things such that some aspects of them change but others remain
###471 the same. So, for instance,
###474 if you take a glass of water and you pour it into another
###479 glass that's shallow or tall, it won't change the amount of
###484 water you have. If you take a bunch of pennies
###486 and you spread them out, you don't get more pennies.
###489 But kids, according to Piaget, don't know that and this is one
###492 of the real cool demonstrations. Any of you who have access to a
###496 four- or five-year-old, [laughter]
###498 a sibling or something--Do not take one without permission,
###501 but if you have access to a four- or five-year-old you can
###504 do this yourself. This is what it looks like.
###506 The first one has no sound. The second one is going to be
###509 sound that's going to come on at the end.
###511 But there's two rows of checkers.
###513 She asks the kid which one has more.
###517 The kid says they're the same. Then she says--Now she asks him
###523 which one has more, that or that.
###527 So that's really stupid. And it's an amazing finding
###531 kids will do that and it's a robust finding.
###535 Here's another example. So, they're the same.
###538 
###547 So, it's a cool finding of that stage, suggesting a limitation
###551 in how you deal and make sense of the world.
###555 The next phase, concrete operations,
###557 from seven to twelve, you can solve the conservation
###560 problem, but still you're limited to the
###563 extent you're capable of abstract reasoning.
###566 So the mathematical notions of infinity or logical notions like
###571 logical entailment are beyond a child of this age.
###574 The child is able to do a lot, but still it's to some extent
###578 stuck in the concrete world. And then finally,
###581 at around age twelve, you could get abstract and
###585 scientific reasoning. And this is the Piagetian
###590 theory in very brief form. Now, Piaget fared a lot better
###596 than did Freud or Skinner for several reasons.
###602 One reason is these are interesting and falsifiable
###605 claims about child development. So claims that--about the
###608 failure of conservation in children at different ages could
###612 be easily tested and systematically tested,
###615 and in fact, there's a lot of support for
###618 them. Piaget had a rich theoretical
###620 framework, pulling together all sorts of observations in
###623 different ways, wrote many, many books and
###625 articles and articulated his theory very richly.
###628 And most of all, I think, he had some really
###630 striking findings. Before Piaget,
###632 nobody noticed these conservation findings.
###635 Before Piaget, nobody noticed that babies had
###638 this problem tracking and understanding objects.
###641 At the same time, however, there are limitations
###644 in Piaget's theory. Some of these limitations are
###649 theoretical. It's an interesting question as
###652 to whether he really explains how a child goes from a concrete
###655 thinker to an abstract thinker, or how he goes from not having
###659 object permanence to understanding object permanence.
###662 There's methodological limitations.
###665 Piaget was really big into question and answer,
###668 but one problem with this is that children aren't very good
###671 with language, and this might lead you to
###673 underestimate how much they know.
###676 And this is particularly a problem the younger you get.
###680 Methodology is going to loom heavy in the discussion of any
###684 science and that includes psychology.
###687 Often 90% of the game is discovering a clever method
###692 through which to test your hypotheses.
###695 We're going to talk a little bit about that regarding babies.
###698 I'll give you another example from a very different domain.
###701 There was a set of scientists interested in studying tickling.
###705 So, when you tickle somebody, under what circumstances will
###709 they laugh? Where do you have to tickle
###711 them? Can you tickle yourself?
###712 Does it have to be a surprise, and so on?
###715 It turns out very difficult to study this in a lab.
###718 You're not going to have your experimental credit.
###719 You come into the lab and say, "Okay.
###720 I'm the graduate student. Ha, ha, ha."
###723 And [laughter] in fact, an example of a
###725 methodological attempt was done by Henry Gleitman at University
###728 of Pennsylvania, who built a tickle machine,
###731 which was this box with these two giant hands that went
###735 "r-r-r-r." This was a failure because
###737 people could not go near the tickle machine without
###740 convulsing in laughter. But we will discuss when we
###744 have a lecture on laughter a bit of the tickle sciences.
###749 And finally there's factual. What do infants and children
###753 really know? It's possible that due to the
###756 methodological limitations of Piaget, he systematically
###760 underestimated what children and babies know.
###764 And in fact, I'll present some evidence
###766 suggesting that this is in fact--that this is the case.
###769 So, I want to introduce you to the modern science of infant
###774 cognition. Infant cognition has been
###777 something studied for a very long time.
###779 And there was a certain view that has had behind it a
###783 tremendous philosophical and psychological consensus.
###787 And it's summarized in this Onion headline here.
###791 And the idea is that babies are stupid, that babies really don't
###797 know much about the world. Now, the work that this
###800 Onion headline is satirizing is the recent
###803 studies, which I'm going to talk about,
###806 suggested that on the contrary, babies might be smarter than
###809 you think. And to discover the
###811 intelligence of babies we have to ourselves be pretty smart in
###815 developing different techniques. To study what a baby knows,
###819 you can't ask your questions. Babies can't talk.
###823 You could look at what it does but babies are not very
###826 coordinated or skilled so you need to use clever methods.
###830 One clever method is to look at their brain waves [laughter].
###835 This child on the right died during testing.
###838 It was a tragic--It was crushed by the weights [laughter]
###841 of the electrodes. He's happy though.
###843 You could study their brain waves.
###846 One of the few things babies can do is they could suck on a
###849 pacifier. And you might think,
###850 well, how could you learn anything from that?
###852 Well, for instance, you could build machines that
###855 when babies suck on a pacifier they hear music or they hear
###858 language, and then you could look at how
###861 much they suck on the pacifier to determine what they like.
###865 But undeniably we know most of our--we got most of our
###869 knowledge about babies from studies of their looking times.
###875 That's one thing babies can do. They can look.
###879 And I have up here--This is a picture of Elizabeth Spelke,
###882 who is a developmental psychologist who's developed the
###885 most research on looking at babies' looking times and what
###889 you could learn from them. And I have here two ways you
###892 could learn from looking. One is preference.
###895 So for instance, suppose you want to know,
###898 for whatever reason, do babies like the looks of
###900 dogs or cats? Well, you could put a baby
###903 down, have a picture of a dog here, a picture of a cat here,
###908 and see which one the baby looks at.
###911 Babies can move their eyes and that could tell you something.
###914 Do babies distinguish pretty faces from ugly faces?
###918 Well, put a pretty face here, an ugly face here,
###920 see if the baby prefers to look at the pretty one.
###923 You could also do habituation and surprise.
###928 And much of the studies I'm going to talk about here involve
###931 habituation and surprise. Habituation is a fancy word for
###935 boredom. What you do is you show a baby
###938 something over and over again. Now, remember from behaviorism
###942 the baby will learn this isn't very interesting.
###945 Then you show the baby something different.
###948 If the baby really sees it as different, the baby will look
###952 longer, and you could use that as a measure of what babies find
###956 different. For instance,
###957 suppose you want to know if the baby can tell green from red.
###960 Well, you could show the baby a green patch, a green patch,
###963 a green patch, a green patch;
###964 the baby'll get bored, then a red patch.
###967 If they all look the same to the baby, the baby will just
###970 continue to tune out, but if the red looks different
###973 the baby will perk up. And this is,
###976 in fact, one way they study color vision in babies.
###980 Surprise is related to this. You could show babies something
###985 that shouldn't happen. If babies are like--If babies
###988 also think it shouldn't happen, they might look longer,
###992 and essentially what happens is scientists do magic tricks to
###996 explore this very thing. And to start with some real
###999 examples, a lot of this infant research has gone back to the
###1003 Piagetian question of object permanence,
###1006 asking, "Is it really true babies don't know that objects
###1011 remain even when they're out of sight?"
###1014 So one very simple study by Spelke and Baillargeon:
###1019 Have babies shown a block with a bar going back and forth like
###1024 that. So the bar just goes back and
###1027 forth. Now, there's something you do
###1029 that's so obvious you probably don't even know you're doing it.
###1033 When you see a display like that, what you assume is there's
###1035 a bar there, and what that means is there's something in the
###1038 middle that you've never seen before.
###1040 But of course, if you were a simple perceptual
###1043 creature, you would just see that there'd be a bar on top and
###1047 a bar on the bottom. You wouldn't expect anything in
###1049 the middle because you never saw anything in the middle.
###1051 So, what you do then is you show babies this and then you
###1055 show them either B or C and if we do this with adults you
###1059 expect B, C is almost a joke. And, in fact,
###1062 babies respond the same way. Babies expect there to be an
###1066 entire, complete bar and are surprised and look longer at the
###1070 broken bar. Other studies,
###1072 some of them--Well, here's another study by Rene
###1075 Baillargeon looking at the same thing in a different way.
###1079 You show the baby, say a six-month-old,
###1083 a stage with a block on it. Then a screen rises and
###1088 obscures the block. Now, if the babies expect the
###1092 block to still be there, they should think the block
###1096 should stop the screen. On the other hand,
###1099 if out of sight out of mind, they should expect the screen
###1102 to keep going. So, what you do is you set up a
###1105 couple of displays, one where the block is stopped,
###1108 the other one where you take this away with a trap door and
###1111 it keeps going. And, as you see,
###1114 the baby screams when this happens.
###1116 That doesn't really happen, but they do look longer.
###1121 One final example of an object permanence study.
###1124 Some of this work's been done at Yale in Karen Wynn's lab,
###1128 where they look at babies' understanding of addition and
###1131 subtraction. And a lot of it is done with
###1134 real objects, but there's also animated
###1135 versions so here is an animated example.
###1138 
###1161 Babies are surprised. They expect 2 - 1 = 1 and when
###1167 2 - 1 = 2 or 3 or 0, they look longer,
###1171 indicating surprise. And even six-month-olds are
###1175 sensitive to these rudimentary facts of arithmetic,
###1178 telling us something about their mathematical knowledge,
###1181 but also telling us something about that they expect things to
###1184 remain when they're out of sight.
###1185 Now, this research suggests that infants' understanding of
###1190 the physical world is there from the very start,
###1194 but at the same time not entirely.
###1197 We know there are certain things babies don't know.
###1200 Here's an example. Suppose you show babies this.
###1204 You have a block here and then you have something above there
###1207 floating in mid air. Babies find this surprising.
###1211 Even six-month-olds find this surprising.
###1214 It violates gravity, but six-month-olds aren't smart
###1218 enough to know that a block just stuck over here is also
###1222 surprising. Twelve-month-olds will think
###1225 that it should fall. Six-month-olds don't,
###1227 and even 12-month-olds don't find anything weird about this,
###1231 while adults are sophisticated enough to understand that that's
###1236 an unstable configuration and should fall over.
###1239 So, although some things are built in, some things develop.
###1244 And this raises the question of, "How do we explain
###1247 development?" How do we explain when babies
###1250 come to know things that they didn't originally know?
###1254 Well, one answer is neural maturation, growth of the brain.
###1260 Most of the neurons you have now in your head,
###1264 right now, you had when you were in your mother's uterus.
###1269 What happens in development isn't for the most part the
###1272 growth of new neurons. It's for the most part pruning,
###1275 getting rid of neurons. So, the neural structures
###1278 change radically as babies kind of get rid of excess neurons
###1282 through development. At the same time though,
###1285 connections between neurons grow like crazy and they--and
###1289 this process of synaptic growth where there are the connections
###1294 across different synapses peaks at about two years.
###1298 Finally, remember myelination, where you sort of get this
###1301 fatty sheath over your neuron to make it more effective?
###1304 That also happens through development, and in fact,
###1307 it goes through development and even teenagers are not fully
###1311 myelinated. In particular,
###1313 they're not fully myelinated in their frontal lobes.
###1316 Recall that frontal lobes are involved in things like
###1320 restraint and willpower. And so, it could be the problem
###1324 is the baby's brain doesn't develop yet.
###1327 Another possibility is there's problems with inhibition.
###1332 This is related, again, to the frontal lobes and
###1335 this comes out with the A, not B error.
###1338 So, remember the baby reaches, reaches, reaches.
###1342 It's moved, reach, follow, keeps reaching the same
###1347 place. And it could be that babies
###1349 don't know anything about objects.
###1350 But another possibility is once you do something it's kind of
###1353 hard to stop. It takes a bit of control to
###1356 stop. And there's all sorts of
###1358 independent evidence that babies lack this control.
###1360 The part of their brain that could control certain behaviors
###1365 is just not active yet. There's a very nice
###1369 illustration of inhibitory problems from a "Simpsons"
###1372 episode that actually sort of covers anything you might want
###1375 to know about developmental differences.
###1378 
###1381 And that basically may sum up much of developmental
###1384 psychology. That the child essentially--he
###1388 does A, A, A. It's moved.
###1390 You go, "doh!" and he keeps going for it.
###1393 And there's some evidence that's true.
###1395 Adele Diamond who studies this finds that although kids reach
###1399 for A, they look for B, as if they know it's there but
###1403 they can't stop themselves from reaching.
###1406 And we'll continue this theme a little bit later.
###1408 Finally, it might be kids don't know things.
###1412 Some things you've got to learn. And this is true in all sorts
###1416 of domains – in the social world, in the economic world,
###1420 in the political world – and it's true as well in the
###1423 physical world. In fact, there's some things
###1425 even adults don't know. So, here's a study by Michael
###1429 McCloskey with college students. Here's the idea.
###1434 You have a tube, a transparent--a tube--a hollow
###1438 tube, and at the top of the tube you throw a ball through so it
###1443 whips through the tube and it comes out.
###1447 The question is, "What happens to it?"
###1449 Does it go in the path of A, or does it go in the path of B?
###1455 Without looking around, who votes for A?
###1458 Who votes for B? Here's the weird thing.
###1462 Whenever I do this at Yale everybody gets the damn thing
###1466 right [laughter]. At Johns Hopkins,
###1469 50/50, [laughter] for A and B.
###1473 I got to get a better demo. But anyway, college students
###1477 not here, show systematic biases of incorrect physical
###1482 intuitions. Here's a twist,
###1485 and if you found people who were less wonderful than you
###1489 all, and asked them you'd get a lot of people saying the curving
###1493 thing. But here's a twist.
###1495 Ask somebody, "What if you took a tube and
###1498 you squirted water through it? Where would the water go?"
###1502 Nobody chooses B. Everybody knows the water would
###1505 continue in a straight line, suggesting that when you have
###1508 experience that helps you out, but in absence of experience
###1512 you're kind of lost. We've talked about the physical
###1516 world. What about the social world?
###1518 What about the world of people? Well, there's a lot of research
###1521 on this as well. Babies start off with some
###1524 social preferences. If you take newborn
###1526 babies--It's very hard to do research with newborn babies
###1530 actually because of the consent procedure and everything,
###1533 so most of this work is done in France [laughter],
###1537 where they have no laws at all. They just rush in to--Women
###1540 give birth and they rush in and they say, "We are
###1542 psychologists," and then we do experiments on
###1544 the babies, and it's terrific. And this is one of them where
###1549 they compare babies looking at this versus this.
###1554 Babies like the one that looks like a face.
###1557 These are newborns. There are some preferences with
###1561 humans and with other primates to favor faces.
###1564 Babies are also social animals too, so they're natural mimics.
###1568 Andrew Meltzoff, for instance,
###1570 has found that if you go to a newborn baby,
###1573 and if you find a newborn baby, this is the first thing you
###1576 should do. Stick your face right up to the
###1579 newborn baby and go like this and stick your tongue out.
###1583 And Meltzoff finds that babies more often than not stick their
###1588 tongues out back, suggesting some sort of social
###1591 connection from one person to another, and then later on
###1594 babies are mimics. Babies more often than not will
###1598 copy the face next to them. Now, these--the nature of these
###1602 responses, this preferring faces, this sort of mimicry,
###1607 is a matter of debate, and there's a lot of research
###1609 going on asking how smart are babies.
###1611 Can we see--use some of the same methods that we've looked
###1615 at for the physical world to look at the social world?
###1619 And to illustrate one of the studies, I'll tell you about a
###1622 study that I did with Valerie Kuhlmeier and Karen Wynn.
###1626 And so, what we tested was nine-month-olds and
###1628 twelve-month-olds, and we showed them movies.
###1631 So, they're sitting down and they're seeing a movie where one
###1634 character's going to help a ball achieve a goal,
###1636 and another character's going to hinder the ball.
###1638 And then we're going to see whether they expect the ball to
###1642 approach the one that helped it versus the one that hindered it.
###1646 So, this is what a baby would see.
###1650 This is literally the same movie a baby would see in the
###1652 experiment. The thing is for these sorts of
###1655 experiments there is a lot of control, so something that's a
###1658 square in one movie will be a triangle in another movie;
###1661 something that's on the top in one movie will be on the bottom
###1664 in another movie. So, this is an example movie
###1666 but this is what babies would see.
###1668 
###1684 And they'd see this over and over again and the question is
###1688 would they expect babies--would babies expect the one to
###1691 approach the one that helped it or approach the one that
###1695 hindered it? And what we find is,
###1697 statistically, babies look longer when shown a
###1700 movie where it approaches the one that hindered it versus
###1703 helped it. And this we take as preliminary
###1706 evidence that they have a social interpretation.
###1711 They see this movie as you see this movie in terms of helping
###1714 and hindering, and somebody going to somebody
###1716 that helped it versus hindered it.
###1717 You could then ask--This makes a prediction that babies should
###1721 themselves prefer the creature who's the helper versus the
###1725 hinderer, and to explore this,
###1727 a graduate student in this department, Kiley Hamlin,
###1730 has started a series of studies where they show babies
###1733 three-dimensional scenes and then give them the characters
###1736 and see which one they reach for.
###1739 So, here's video so you could see how this experiment is done.
###1741 
###1801 Now, the next trial is from a different study.
###1804 A different thing we use, and the baby is given a choice.
###1808 One thing to know methodologically is the person
###1811 giving a choice is blind to the study.
###1814 And blind here is a technical term meaning she had no idea
###1817 what the baby saw, and the point about this is to
###1820 avoid either intentional or unintentional sort of trying to
###1824 get the answer you want. She couldn't do that because
###1826 she didn't know what the right answer is.
###1828 So, here's what the baby would see.
###1829 
###1840 So, this suggests that some social understanding may be
###1847 there from the very start. This evidence is tentative,
###1852 very controversial. But now, I want to raise a huge
###1857 developmental puzzle and the puzzle is there are some ways in
###1862 which babies are--not just babies,
###1865 but young children are very clueless when it comes to
###1870 people. And so, I have a film clip here
###1873 of two very nice studies showing babies' ignorant--sorry,
###1876 young children's ignorance of other people.
###1879 I'll show you the studies and then we'll briefly discuss what
###1886 they mean. Professor Paul Bloom:
###1888 Before discussing that example in a little bit more detail,
###1892 any questions? What are your questions?
###1893 Yes, in back. Student: [inaudible]
###1896 Professor Paul Bloom: Typically--I don't know for
###1899 those particular children, but typically on those tasks
###1902 three-year-olds and young four-year-olds tend to fail,
###1906 and around the age of four or five kids tend to succeed.
###1910 There's sort of a period around the age of four,
###1913 four and a half, where kids make the transition
###1916 from failure to success. The question,
###1918 by the way, was when do children--in that video when
###1921 were the--what were the ages of the children who failed and who
###1924 passed?
###1924 
###1927 Yes. Student: [inaudible]
###1933 Professor Paul Bloom: The question of whether
###1939 discriminant conditioning has been used with babies to explore
###1945 what sort of concepts they have. I don't know.
###1951 Does anybody--It has been-- Graduate Student:
###1954 --It's not as effective-- Professor Paul Bloom:
###1957 Koleen answered and said that it's not as effective as other
###1960 methods. Part of the problem with using
###1962 operant conditioning with babies is it's difficult to get them to
###1966 behave in any systematic way. So, the looking-time measures
###1971 tend to be more subtle. Any other questions?
###1976 
###1981 Oh. Yes.
###1983 Student: [inaudible] Professor Paul Bloom:
###1989 Oh. The question of why they
###1991 chose--the baby--the kids chose the rocket ship one as opposed
###1994 to the Rafael one. It wasn't what they were
###1997 interested in in the experiment. And my bet is when they chose
###2000 the stickers they had a pretty good sense of why,
###2003 of which ones the boys would prefer in those studies.
###2006 The question of why a boy might prefer one sort of sticker,
###2010 and you might get a different response with a girl,
###2013 is going to come up later when we discuss different theories of
###2016 sex differences. But that was something I think
###2018 they were just assuming in the study to get it off the ground.
###2020 
###2027 Okay.
###2028 
###2034 There's a huge debate over what's going on there.
###2038 And if you listened at the end to the psychologist summarizing
###2042 the data, the psychologist had a very good and very clear and
###2045 strong idea of what was going on.
###2048 It was that children need to know more about minds.
###2051 The children don't know about that you can do something with
###2055 the intent to deceive. They don't understand that
###2059 somebody could choose what you chose in a malicious way.
###2064 This is possible. This is one respectable theory,
###2069 but the alternative is they have the right knowledge,
###2074 but they suffer from problems with inhibition.
###2078 So, consider both studies. The first study,
###2080 the one with the deceptive dolls with the big shoes and
###2083 little shoes, is actually fairly difficult.
###2086 And it's possible that children kind of got overwhelmed with it,
###2090 and when asked what would the mother think,
###2093 who the mother would think stole the food,
###2096 responded with who really stole the food.
###2099 And that there's some pull towards the right answer that
###2102 makes this task difficult. The second one--the second
###2106 study illustrates this issue even more clearly.
###2109 Take the boy who kept failing. He kept pointing to the rocket
###2114 ship and mean monkey kept taking it away.
###2116 It's possible that he genuinely didn't know what to do,
###2120 that he wasn't smart enough to understand that he needed to
###2124 point to the other one. But it's also possible that
###2128 it's a Homer Simpson-like effect, where when asked to
###2132 point to what he wants, he just couldn't help but point
###2136 to the one he wanted. And that the extra work it
###2140 takes to lie was beyond him. And, in support of the second
###2145 alternative, even adults find these tasks involving lying and
###2150 deception more difficult. They were slower at them.
###2153 We make more mistakes than tasks that don't involve lying
###2158 and deception. So, I'm raising this not to
###2161 solve the problem. You'll read more about it in
###2164 the Peter Gray textbook and more about it in The Norton
###2168 readings on development, but just to raise this as an
###2172 interesting area of debate. Another interesting area of
###2177 debate is, "What's the relationship between different
###2182 sorts of development?" So, I started off with Piaget,
###2187 and Piaget, like Freud, believed in general,
###2191 across the board changes in how children think.
###2196 An alternative, though, is that there's
###2199 separate modules, and this is a view developed,
###2203 again, by Noam Chomsky, and also by the philosopher of
###2207 mind Jerry Fodor, who claimed that the whole idea
###2210 of a child developing as a single story is mistaken.
###2214 What you get instead is there are separate pre-wired systems
###2218 for reasoning about the world. These systems have some
###2222 built-in knowledge, and they have to do some
###2226 learning, but the learning pattern varies
###2229 from system to system and there's a separateness to them.
###2233 Why should we take this view seriously?
###2235 Well, one reason is that there are developmental disorders that
###2240 seem to involve damage to one system but not to another.
###2244 And the classic case of this is a disorder known as autism.
###2247 And autism is something I've always found a fascinating
###2251 disorder for many reasons. It's actually why I entered
###2254 psychology. I started off working with
###2257 children with autism. And it could be taken as a
###2260 striking illustration of how the social part of your brain is
###2264 distinct from other parts of your brain.
###2268 So, what autism is is a disorder that strikes about one
###2271 in a thousand people, mostly boys.
###2274 And the dominant problems concern--consist of a lack of
###2279 social connectedness, problems with language,
###2282 problems dealing with people, and more generally,
###2285 a problem of what the psychologist,
###2288 Simon Baron-Cohen has described as "mind blindness."
###2292 In that autistic people show no impairments dealing with the
###2295 physical world, they show no impairments
###2297 on--they don't necessarily show any impairments on mathematical
###2301 skills or spatial skills, but they have a lot of problems
###2305 with people. Now, many autistic children
###2308 have no language; they're totally shut off from
###2311 society. But even some of them who'd
###2313 learned language and who managed to get some sort of independent
###2316 life, nevertheless will suffer from a
###2319 severe social impairment. And this could be shown in all
###2322 sorts of ways. A simple experiment developed
###2325 by Simon Baron-Cohen goes like this.
###2328 You show this to three- and four-year-olds.
###2330 There's four candies there, and you say,
###2332 "This is Charlie in the middle. Which chocolate will Charlie
###2336 take?" For most children and most of
###2339 you, I hope, the answer's pretty clear: This one.
###2342 Autistic children will often just shrug, say,
###2345 "How could I know?" because they don't
###2348 instinctively appreciate that people's interests and desires
###2351 tend to be attuned to where they're looking.
###2354 Another sort of task, which is a task that's been
###2358 done hundreds, perhaps thousands of times,
###2360 is known as "the false-belief task" and here's the idea.
###2364 You show the child the following situation.
###2368 There's a doll named Maxie and Maxie puts the ball in the
###2374 cupboard. Maxie leaves and a second doll
###2378 enters. The second doll takes the ball
###2381 out of the cupboard and puts it under the bed.
###2385 Maxie comes back and the question is, "Where will Maxie
###2389 look for the ball?" Now, this is a question about
###2393 your understanding about minds. The question of where is the
###2398 ball really is a question about the physical world.
###2401 Everyone can solve it, but this question is hard.
###2405 The right answer is Max will--Maxie will look in the
###2409 cupboard, even though it's not really there because Maxie has a
###2415 false belief about the world. Three-year-olds find this
###2419 difficult. Two-year-olds find this
###2421 difficult. Four-year-olds and
###2423 five-year-olds are able to pass this task.
###2425 Normal adults are able to pass this task.
###2428 Children with autism have serious problems.
###2430 And often, people with autism who are otherwise very high
###2434 functioning will fail this task. They'll say,
###2436 "Oh, he must think it's not--He'll--He's going to check
###2438 under the bed." Any questions about autism?
###2443 
###2447 Yes. Student: [inaudible]
###2452 Professor Paul Bloom: Good question.
###2457 It isn't. They're both experiments
###2460 designed to tap an appreciation of false belief.
###2463 The deception one with the shoes and everything looked at
###2467 it in the course of deception. Can you understand that the
###2470 mother might think it's that person even though it's really
###2474 that person? And our kid failed.
###2476 This is a sort of stripped-down version without all the
###2482 fanciness but it tests exactly the same thing.
###2487 Yes. Student: [inaudible]
###2490 Professor Paul Bloom: Nobody knows,
###2493 but there's a theory which won't answer your question but
###2496 will put it into a broader context.
###2498 Simon Baron-Cohen argues that there are certain abilities that
###2502 tend to be more sequestered for males,
###2505 and other abilities that are more sequestered,
###2508 more focused on females. Social abilities,
###2511 he argues, tend to be more female than male.
###2514 So, the way Baron puts it, provocatively,
###2517 is to be a man is to suffer from a very mild form of autism
###2521 [laughter]. The idea is then that autistic
###2524 individuals suffer from what he calls extreme male brains,
###2528 and as such, it stands to reason that they'd
###2531 be more sampled from the male population than the female
###2534 population. That's such an interesting
###2536 issue, that again, when we return to talk about
###2539 sex differences we'll look at that in a little bit more detail
###2542 to see if it's supported by the evidence.
###2545 Yes. Student: [inaudible]
###2550 Professor Paul Bloom: I'm sorry.
###2556 Tell me the--Is the severity of autism… Student:
###2561 [inaudible] Professor Paul Bloom:
###2564 It's an interesting question. The question is,
###2569 "How do you think about the severity of autism with regard
###2572 to developmental stages?" And sort of surprisingly,
###2577 autism can't really be thought of in that way.
###2581 So, it's not like an adult with autism is like a three-year-old
###2584 or a two-year-old. In some ways,
###2586 somebody with autism isn't like any child at all,
###2589 any normally developing child at all.
###2592 So, it's not really a developmental delay in the way
###2596 that it might make sense to think about certain forms of
###2600 retardation. On the other hand,
###2602 when we think about how severe autism is we do look at things
###2605 like how much language does the person have,
###2608 and in that sense, it is related to development.
###2612 Yes. Student:
###2614 What are the chances that someone who's autistic would be
###2617 able to overcome their deficiencies?
###2619 Professor Paul Bloom: The majority of people with
###2622 autism. It's a good question.
###2623 The question is, "What are the chances that
###2625 somebody with autism will be able to overcome their
###2628 deficiencies?" Autism is a funny disorder in
###2630 that there's a lot of media publication and media
###2633 presentation. Often the people who are
###2635 showcased in the media tend to be very exceptional.
###2638 So, there's a woman, Temple Grandin,
###2640 who's autistic and--Has anybody here heard of Temple Grandin?
###2644 She wrote some wonderful books about her experience as an
###2647 autistic person, but she's very unusual.
###2649 So a lot depends, to answer your question,
###2652 how one defines autism, and whether one includes
###2655 Asperger syndrome, which is a limited,
###2658 a more mild syndrome, as a form of autism.
###2662 The answer is that the majority of people with autism have
###2665 severe problems, and will not,
###2667 and at this stage, with this level of therapy,
###2670 will not lead a normal life. Student:
###2673 More specifically, what I meant was,
###2676 when you showed the example of Rain Man, ere they exceptional
###2681 [inaudible] Professor Paul Bloom:
###2684 Right. The question is about so-called
###2688 autistic savants. So, Rain Man,
###2690 the character played by Dustin Hoffman, had extraordinary
###2693 mathematical abilities. And some people with autism
###2696 have extraordinary artistic abilities or mathematical
###2700 abilities or musical abilities and these are amazing.
###2705 It's an amazing question why they have it but this is a very
###2709 small minority. This is a very--It's
###2711 fascinating that it happens at all, that you have severe damage
###2715 but compensated with some powerful skill.
###2717 Now, I know I'm answering your question I think in a better
###2720 way, but it's actually very rare.
###2722 Most people with autism do not have any exceptional abilities
###2724 that go along with it.
###2725 
###2731 Another question is if you believe in modules--If there are
###2737 modules, what are they? And so far when reviewing the
###2741 developmental data we've talked about two of them:
###2745 physics and people. An object module and a social
###2749 module. But other people have argued
###2751 that there is a special module in your brain for dealing with
###2754 artifacts, that is, things like tables and
###2757 chairs and cars and forks. Some people have argued there's
###2761 a module for sociology, for dealing with human groups,
###2764 races and classes and so on. Some have even argued that
###2768 there is an intuitive biology, a common-sense biological
###2772 understanding of the world that's separate from your
###2775 understanding of people and physics.
###2778 And, in fact, the most dominant proponent of
###2782 the view is our very own Frank Keil,
###2785 Master of Morse College at Yale, who has strongly defended
###2789 the notion of an intuitive biological module.
###2793 Final question, just to raise:
###2795 I've talked in terms of the modular view but there might
###2800 also be profound general differences between children and
###2804 adults, not just specific to how you
###2806 think about objects or how you think about people or how you
###2808 think about this or how you think about that,
###2810 but rather more general. And one claim,
###2813 which we're going to return to briefly next class when we talk
###2817 about language, is that there's a very,
###2819 very big difference between a creature that doesn't have
###2823 language and a creature that does.
###2826 And part of the claim is that learning a language,
###2829 learning to speak, reconfigures the human brain in
###2833 such a way that is really exceptional.
###2836 And that has no parallel in any other species.
###2839 And this is an interesting claim and one we'll talk about.
###2844 Finally, I want to end with an example from Stephen Jay Gould.
###2849 Suppose you hate development; you hate developmental
###2853 psychology; you hate babies;
###2855 you hate children; they're not cute;
###2857 they're ugly; you don't want to have them;
###2859 you don't want to study them; you're annoyed that we have to
###2861 discuss them. Fine.
###2863 But there are reasons to study development even if you are not
###2869 interested in children because sometimes developmental studies
###2874 and developmental data and developmental science can inform
###2880 questions about adults. And Stephen Jay Gould has a
###2883 very nice example of this. He asked the question "Is a
###2887 zebra a black animal with white stripes or a white animal with
###2892 black stripes?" Now, you could look at adult
###2895 zebras all day long and you're never going to figure this out.
###2899 But if you want to know the answer, and I knew it,
###2902 but I forget what it is--It doesn't matter.
###2904 But if you wanted to know it you could.
###2906 You would look at development and you'd watch the
###2909 embryological development of a zebra and that's how you would
###2911 learn the answer to your question.
###2913 In fact, I'll end with a nice quote.
###2916 This is by the famous biologist, D'Arcy Thompson,
###2920 who wrote the book On Growth and Form,
###2924  and it's sort of the model of many developmental
###2927 psychologists and many evolutionary psychologists so
###2930 I'll end with this: "Everything is the way it is
###2932 because it got that way." Okay.
###2935 I'll see you next week.
