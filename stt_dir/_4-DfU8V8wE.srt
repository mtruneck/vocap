MIKE SPINELLI: Hey, welcome to
"Drive Central." Here's where


4
0:0:23,83 --> 0:0:24,69
you're going to find out
what's happening


5
0:0:24,69 --> 0:0:25,76
on Drive this week.

Don't forget @drive on Twitter,
facebook.com/drivetv,


7
0:0:28,88 --> 0:0:32,84
comments below, or
give me a call.


8
0:0:32,84 --> 0:0:34,95
I'm in the book, right Ian?


9
0:0:34,95 --> 0:0:37,3
What book is that?


10
0:0:37,3 --> 0:0:40,19
"Julie and the Wolves." Anyway,
this week on "Tuned,"


11
0:0:40,19 --> 0:0:41,93
what is it like to drive
a drift car?


12
0:0:41,93 --> 0:0:43,31
Well, Matt Farah finds out.


13
0:0:43,31 --> 0:0:48,95
The car is Corey Hosford's
Formula Drift Nissan 350z.


14
0:0:48,95 --> 0:0:50,2
Let's see.


15
0:0:50,2 --> 0:1:16,36



16
0:1:16,36 --> 0:1:17,99
That's "Tuned," every
Monday on Drive.


17
0:1:17,99 --> 0:1:20,33
And remember that story we
promised last week about the


18
0:1:20,33 --> 0:1:22,68
lucky son of a bitch who gets
to test drive all those


19
0:1:22,68 --> 0:1:25,75
megabuck hyper cars in Sweden?


20
0:1:25,75 --> 0:1:26,24
Yeah.


21
0:1:26,24 --> 0:1:28,17
We're running that this week.


22
0:1:28,17 --> 0:1:30,41
It's Robert from Koenigsegg.


23
0:1:30,41 --> 0:1:32,59
Let's take a look at a clip.


24
0:1:32,59 --> 0:1:35,22
ROBERT SERWANSKI: My name is
Robert Serwanski, and I'm the


25
0:1:35,22 --> 0:1:36,47
test driver of Koenigsegg.

ROBERT SERWANSKI: My job
is basically two parts.


30
0:1:54,34 --> 0:1:58,76
I develop the cars, how they
handle, and performance wise,


31
0:1:58,76 --> 0:2:1,78
and I also am a part of
the production line.


32
0:2:1,78 --> 0:2:6,68



33
0:2:6,68 --> 0:2:8,74
MIKE SPINELLI: That's "Inside
Koenigsegg," every Tuesday.


34
0:2:8,74 --> 0:2:11,72
And this week Chris Harris pairs
up two German GT cars,


35
0:2:11,72 --> 0:2:15,7
the Mercedes Benz
SL63 and BMW M6.


36
0:2:15,7 --> 0:2:17,38
Is it the ultimate
GT showdown?


37
0:2:17,38 --> 0:2:17,83
Could be.


38
0:2:17,83 --> 0:2:20,24
Let's watch.


39
0:2:20,24 --> 0:2:23,76
CHRIS HARRIS: I want you to
imagine that the year is 1988,


40
0:2:23,76 --> 0:2:26,33
and that I'm wearing shoulder
pads and braces and that kind


41
0:2:26,33 --> 0:2:28,13
of stuff, and carrying
a Filofax.


42
0:2:28,13 --> 0:2:30,93
And we've decided to get
together the fastest BMW 6


43
0:2:30,93 --> 0:2:33,52
series and the fastest
Mercedes SL.


44
0:2:33,52 --> 0:2:35,85
Those would have been, according
to my memory bank,


45
0:2:35,85 --> 0:2:39,72
the M635 CSI and the 500 SL.


46
0:2:39,72 --> 0:2:42,38
Together, those two cars would
have had a power output of


47
0:2:42,38 --> 0:2:44,792
just over 500 horsepower.


48
0:2:44,792 --> 0:2:49,96
Fast forward to 2013 and their
equivalents, the SL63 and new


49
0:2:49,96 --> 0:2:54,9
M6 have over 1,100 horsepower.


50
0:2:54,9 --> 0:2:57,24
Sometimes I find it difficult
to justify cars like this,


51
0:2:57,24 --> 0:2:59,1
because they're not sports
cars, and they're


52
0:2:59,1 --> 0:3:1,28
not full-on GT cars.


53
0:3:1,28 --> 0:3:4,99
So let's find out what they're
actually like to use, and


54
0:3:4,99 --> 0:3:7,12
whether they're just too
powerful and too much for


55
0:3:7,12 --> 0:3:8,1
modern motoring.


56
0:3:8,1 --> 0:3:13,1
But I suspect they're actually
rather good fun.


57
0:3:13,1 --> 0:3:15,64
MIKE SPINELLI: That's Chris
Harris on "Cars" every


58
0:3:15,64 --> 0:3:18,85
Wednesday this season
on Drive Three.


59
0:3:18,85 --> 0:3:21,59
No, it's just Drive One.


60
0:3:21,59 --> 0:3:22,81
No, it's not Drive One at all.


61
0:3:22,81 --> 0:3:24,5
It's just Drive.


62
0:3:24,5 --> 0:3:25,955

this week for you guys to


63
0:3:25,955 --> 0:3:27,3
debate, and us to talk
about on "Road


64
0:3:27,3 --> 0:3:28,85

65
0:3:28,85 --> 0:3:31,43

as Leo Parente gets us


66

caught up with the upcoming
2013 racing season.


67
0:3:35,43 --> 0:3:40,95
And as I said last week,
that's it for "Drive


68
0:3:40,95 --> 0:3:41,7
