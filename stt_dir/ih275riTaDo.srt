1
0:1:26,419 --> 0:1:27,82
For luck.


2
0:1:27,82 --> 0:1:30,924
Thank you, sir.
Being a sailor, you'll need luck.


3
0:1:30,924 --> 0:1:33,259
A young sailor too.


4
0:1:33,259 --> 0:1:35,795
I don't need eyes to tell me that.


5
0:1:35,795 --> 0:1:39,232
Young seamen all want luck
when they're outward bound.


6
0:1:39,232 --> 0:1:41,834
Only the old ones know
that there's nothing...


7
0:1:41,834 --> 0:1:45,605
...but bad luck and bad blows at sea.


8
0:1:45,605 --> 0:1:47,24
An officer too.


9
0:1:47,24 --> 0:1:48,675
How'd you know?


10
0:1:48,675 --> 0:1:51,144
I heard your suitcase go down.


11
0:1:51,144 --> 0:1:56,82
A seaman would be having a soft bag.


12
0:1:56,82 --> 0:1:58,484
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.


13
0:1:58,484 --> 0:2:1,87
If it's the <i>Altair</i> you're boarding, sir...


14
0:2:1,87 --> 0:2:2,689
...she's a bad ship.


15
0:2:2,689 --> 0:2:6,459
You've got a blind man's tricks
for telling what men are like, but ships...


16
0:2:6,459 --> 0:2:24,811
...you can't tell about ships.


17
0:2:24,811 --> 0:2:44,364
I'm the third officer.
Where can I find the captain?


18
0:2:44,364 --> 0:2:47,867
<i>This is another man</i>
<i>I can never know...</i>


19
0:2:47,867 --> 0:2:50,303
<i>... because I cannot talk with him.</i>


20
0:2:50,303 --> 0:2:53,873
<i>For I am a mute and cannot speak.</i>


21
0:2:53,873 --> 0:2:56,442
<i>I am cut off from other men...</i>


22
0:2:56,442 --> 0:2:58,978
<i>... but in my own silence...</i>


23
0:2:58,978 --> 0:3:1,814
<i>... I can hear things they cannot hear...</i>


24
0:3:1,814 --> 0:3:10,69
<i>... know things they can never know.</i>


25
0:3:10,69 --> 0:3:57,136
Okay, fellas, pull that cover over here.


26
0:3:57,136 --> 0:3:59,272
- Mr. Merriam?
- Yes, sir.


27
0:3:59,272 --> 0:4:0,94
I'm Captain Stone.


28
0:4:0,94 --> 0:4:3,309
How do you do, sir?


29
0:4:3,309 --> 0:4:5,812
I chose you, Merriam,
and I don't regret my choice.


30
0:4:5,812 --> 0:4:7,98
- Thank you, sir.
- I looked up the records...


31
0:4:7,98 --> 0:4:11,551
...of the training ship graduates.
You seemed the most likely man for me.


32
0:4:11,551 --> 0:4:13,352
- You know why?
- No, sir.


33
0:4:13,352 --> 0:4:16,789
Your history could have been
my own at your age.


34
0:4:16,789 --> 0:4:18,191
An orphan.


35
0:4:18,191 --> 0:4:19,625
Serious.


36
0:4:19,625 --> 0:4:24,97
Hardworking.
Anxious to get somewhere.


37
0:4:24,97 --> 0:4:26,566
- We'll get on, you and I.
- Thank you.


38
0:4:26,566 --> 0:4:30,236
I like a good ship, a clean ship,
an obedient ship.


39
0:4:30,236 --> 0:4:32,672
As third officer,
you'll have certain authority.


40
0:4:32,672 --> 0:4:35,108
Use it well, and <i>Altair</i>
will be that kind of ship.


41
0:4:35,108 --> 0:4:37,543
- I'll do everything I can.
- Fine.


42
0:4:37,543 --> 0:4:39,745
Go to your quarters
and get ready for work.


43
0:4:39,745 --> 0:4:44,5
All right, sir.


44
0:4:44,5 --> 0:4:45,551
Don't.


45
0:4:45,551 --> 0:4:47,42
You've no right to kill that moth.


46
0:4:47,42 --> 0:4:49,589
Its safety doesn't depend on you.


47
0:4:49,589 --> 0:4:52,792
I'm sorry. I don't understand.


48
0:4:52,792 --> 0:4:55,194
Never mind. I'll explain sometime.


49
0:4:55,194 --> 0:4:57,96
We've a long voyage ahead of us.


50
0:4:57,96 --> 0:5:0,766
You know, that's one of the nice things
about long voyages, time for talk...


51
0:5:0,766 --> 0:5:2,335
...time for friendship.


52
0:5:2,335 --> 0:5:16,616
- You'll find your cabin on the main deck.
- All right, sir.


53
0:5:16,616 --> 0:5:18,851
- Oh, steward?
- Yes, sir.


54
0:5:18,851 --> 0:5:20,853
My name is Merriam. I'm the new third.


55
0:5:20,853 --> 0:5:23,156
Your quarters are right over here,
Mr. Merriam.


56
0:5:23,156 --> 0:5:36,569
Thank you.


57
0:5:36,569 --> 0:5:38,37
The berth isn't made up.


58
0:5:38,37 --> 0:5:41,7
Sorry, sir. I haven't had a chance
since Mr. Lingard died.


59
0:5:41,7 --> 0:5:43,809
He was the last third officer.


60
0:5:43,809 --> 0:5:46,112
- He died in this berth?
- That's right, sir.


61
0:5:46,112 --> 0:5:48,981
He had such convulsions,
he would have died on the floor...


62
0:5:48,981 --> 0:5:55,888
...if he hadn't have been held
in the berth.


63
0:5:55,888 --> 0:5:59,792
Somehow, it seemed more proper for him
to die there than on the floor, sir.


64
0:5:59,792 --> 0:6:2,161
- What was the matter with him?
- I don't know, sir.


65
0:6:2,161 --> 0:6:3,563
He didn't want to die.


66
0:6:3,563 --> 0:6:5,965
He was always telling funny stories.


67
0:6:5,965 --> 0:6:9,168
Well, make it up. Can you change
the blankets and the sheets?


68
0:6:9,168 --> 0:6:11,7
- Yes, sir.
- Open the porthole there.


69
0:6:11,7 --> 0:6:13,206
Soon as we're under way,
we'll get air here.


70
0:6:13,206 --> 0:6:17,51
We'll be shoving off in an hour, sir.


71
0:6:17,51 --> 0:6:20,12
On deck, you guys.
The captain wants a look at you.


72
0:6:20,12 --> 0:6:23,449
<i>Rise and shine for the Dunham Line</i>
<i>I don't mean one, I don't mean two</i>


73
0:6:23,449 --> 0:6:26,85
<i>I mean the whole sweet bellboy crew</i>


74
0:6:26,85 --> 0:6:32,425
The skipper wants to look you over.
Get in there, tall one.


75
0:6:32,425 --> 0:6:35,61
Hey, you, Scotty, can the music.


76
0:6:35,61 --> 0:6:37,83
On deck. Come on, Scotty.


77
0:6:37,83 --> 0:6:39,599
I ain't Scotch, Boats. I'm Greek.


78
0:6:39,599 --> 0:6:41,767
It's only Greeks can play
these things good.


79
0:6:41,767 --> 0:6:44,3
In home country,
we play it to the sheep.


80
0:6:44,3 --> 0:6:47,44
You'll get all the sheep you want.
We're going south for a full cargo.


81
0:6:47,44 --> 0:6:49,508
Sheep hides, mutton, tallow.


82
0:6:49,508 --> 0:6:55,14
Why, we even bring back
the smell of the sheep.


83
0:6:55,14 --> 0:6:56,882
We have a new crew, Mr. Merriam.


84
0:6:56,882 --> 0:6:59,385
You and Mr. Bowns better
look them over.


85
0:6:59,385 --> 0:7:4,223
Come on, Merriam.


86
0:7:4,223 --> 0:7:5,925
Go ahead, Boats.


87
0:7:5,925 --> 0:7:7,526
- Ausman, Jack.
- Here.


88
0:7:7,526 --> 0:7:8,995
- Benson, William.
- Here.


89
0:7:8,995 --> 0:7:10,896
- Carter, Claude.
- Present.


90
0:7:10,896 --> 0:7:14,233
Claude.


91
0:7:14,233 --> 0:7:16,168
Pipe down, you guys.


92
0:7:16,168 --> 0:7:17,903
- Corbin, John.
- Here.


93
0:7:17,903 --> 0:7:21,107
I've shipped with this man before.
He's a good seaman, sir.


94
0:7:21,107 --> 0:7:23,175
- Thank you, mister.
- Okay.


95
0:7:23,175 --> 0:7:24,577
- Farnham, Ed.
- Here.


96
0:7:24,577 --> 0:7:25,978
- Mikross, Peter.
- Here.


97
0:7:25,978 --> 0:7:30,16
Lindstrom, Paulo.


98
0:7:30,16 --> 0:7:32,118
Paulo Lindstrom.


99
0:7:32,118 --> 0:7:33,552
The guy's a dummy.


100
0:7:33,552 --> 0:7:34,987
Finn.


101
0:7:34,987 --> 0:7:38,557
Keep your eye on that man, Boats.
I don't want any trouble on this ship.


102
0:7:38,557 --> 0:7:40,359
- McCall, Tom.
- Yeah.


103
0:7:40,359 --> 0:7:41,761
- O'Connor, Jack.
- Present.


104
0:7:41,761 --> 0:7:47,333
- Parker, Louis.
- Here, teacher.


105
0:7:47,333 --> 0:7:48,734
Radd, William.


106
0:7:48,734 --> 0:7:51,704
<i>I'm Billy Radd from La Trinidad</i>


107
0:7:51,704 --> 0:7:53,706
Pipe down, you guys.


108
0:7:53,706 --> 0:7:55,908
Jensen, George. George Jensen.


109
0:7:55,908 --> 0:7:58,344
Jensen.


110
0:7:58,344 --> 0:8:0,112
- Vaughn, Jim.
- Here.


111
0:8:0,112 --> 0:8:1,681
- Waite, Leonard.
- Here.


112
0:8:1,681 --> 0:8:3,649
Everybody here, sir, except Jensen.


113
0:8:3,649 --> 0:8:5,284
Maybe in the fo'c's'le.


114
0:8:5,284 --> 0:8:8,688
George was right behind me
when we came out of the fo'c's'le, sir.


115
0:8:8,688 --> 0:8:11,891
Jensen.


116
0:8:11,891 --> 0:8:17,763
George Jensen.


117
0:8:17,763 --> 0:8:20,766
Jensen.


118
0:8:20,766 --> 0:8:34,58
There he is.


119
0:8:34,58 --> 0:8:36,349
Captain, I don't get any pulse.


120
0:8:36,349 --> 0:8:38,184
I'm afraid the man's dead.


121
0:8:38,184 --> 0:8:40,986
Most likely heart failure, Mr. Bowns.


122
0:8:40,986 --> 0:8:46,158
He was an old man.


123
0:8:46,158 --> 0:8:48,26
<i>The man is dead.</i>


124
0:8:48,26 --> 0:8:52,498
<i>With his death, the waters of the sea</i>
<i>are open to us...</i>


125
0:8:52,498 --> 0:8:55,368
<i>... but there will be other deaths.</i>


126
0:8:55,368 --> 0:8:58,504
<i>And the agony of dying...</i>


127
0:8:58,504 --> 0:9:22,361
<i>... before we come to land again.</i>


128
0:9:22,361 --> 0:9:27,967
Log at zero, sir.


129
0:9:27,967 --> 0:9:30,69
The log is set at zero, sir, 8:23.


130
0:9:30,69 --> 0:9:32,805
Fine.


131
0:9:32,805 --> 0:9:34,273
Seems good to get going.


132
0:9:34,273 --> 0:9:36,542
I heard one of the men
putting it another way.


133
0:9:36,542 --> 0:9:39,111
I heard him say,
"The ship comes to life at sea."


134
0:9:39,111 --> 0:9:41,547
I suppose that's the way
all sailors feel.


135
0:9:41,547 --> 0:9:43,783
It's good for a sailor to go to sea.


136
0:9:43,783 --> 0:9:46,652
It's even better for an officer.


137
0:9:46,652 --> 0:9:49,355
It's a good feeling.


138
0:9:49,355 --> 0:9:52,825
In San Pedro, I was just another captain.


139
0:9:52,825 --> 0:9:58,631
At sea, I am the captain.


140
0:9:58,631 --> 0:10:2,234
It's got to be coiled with the sun.
It's a law of the sea.


141
0:10:2,234 --> 0:10:5,438
That ain't a law.
If you break a law, you get arrested.


142
0:10:5,438 --> 0:10:7,907
If you milk a cow
the wrong way, she kicks.


143
0:10:7,907 --> 0:10:10,543
If you coil a rope the wrong way,
it can't kick.


144
0:10:10,543 --> 0:10:14,38
I believe in logic.


145
0:10:14,38 --> 0:10:17,65
Aboard ship, you'd better believe
in the captain and forget logic.


146
0:10:17,65 --> 0:10:20,853
You coil a line the wrong way once,
and you'll find out.


147
0:10:20,853 --> 0:10:24,39
The captain's got more law at sea
than any man on land has got...


148
0:10:24,39 --> 0:10:27,359
...even the king of Siam...


149
0:10:27,359 --> 0:10:30,95
...or the president
of the United States.


150
0:10:30,95 --> 0:10:32,64
Why, a captain can marry you.


151
0:10:32,64 --> 0:10:36,469
Not me. I had a wife.


152
0:10:36,469 --> 0:10:39,605
No, sir. I don't feel any different.


153
0:10:39,605 --> 0:10:43,442
When I was on the training ship,
I was a cadet. Now I'm an officer.


154
0:10:43,442 --> 0:10:46,779
- Somehow, I don't feel different.
- You should.


155
0:10:46,779 --> 0:10:50,316
It's all the difference between
being a man and being a boy.


156
0:10:50,316 --> 0:10:51,75
It's more than that.


157
0:10:51,75 --> 0:10:54,653
It's the difference between
being a man and being an officer.


158
0:10:54,653 --> 0:10:57,857
I know, but somehow,
I can't believe yet that I'm an officer.


159
0:10:57,857 --> 0:11:0,993
I passed my examinations,
I'm qualified...


160
0:11:0,993 --> 0:11:3,762
...but still I haven't that feeling
that you speak about.


161
0:11:3,762 --> 0:11:6,332
- That feeling of authority.
- You'll learn it.


162
0:11:6,332 --> 0:11:16,842
You'll even learn to take great joy in it.


163
0:11:16,842 --> 0:11:20,613
- You seasick?
- I have never been seasick.


164
0:11:20,613 --> 0:11:23,983
Papa rocked me in his arms
when I was baptized.


165
0:11:23,983 --> 0:11:27,586
That's the way you keep a good Greek kid
from getting sick at sea.


166
0:11:27,586 --> 0:11:32,858
- What's the matter with your belly, then?
- It hurts.


167
0:11:32,858 --> 0:11:35,127
She's a beautiful ship, captain.


168
0:11:35,127 --> 0:11:37,73
A beautiful ship for a first berth.


169
0:11:37,73 --> 0:11:49,8
She's a beautiful ship to command.


170
0:11:49,8 --> 0:11:51,544
Hiya, Tertius.


171
0:11:51,544 --> 0:11:53,479
I'm Sparks.


172
0:11:53,479 --> 0:11:55,381
- What did you call me?
- Tertius.


173
0:11:55,381 --> 0:11:56,782
What's that mean?


174
0:11:56,782 --> 0:12:1,186
You share Bill Shakespeare's lack
of knowledge. No Latin and less Greek.


175
0:12:1,186 --> 0:12:6,392
Tertius, my ignorant friend, means "third,"
and you're the third officer.


176
0:12:6,392 --> 0:12:9,395
I suppose it would be a big help
to give deck orders in Latin.


177
0:12:9,395 --> 0:12:11,33
It's not much use on the radio either.


178
0:12:11,33 --> 0:12:14,6
- Come on in.
- All right.


179
0:12:14,6 --> 0:12:17,202
It's a relief to find
someone onboard I can talk to.


180
0:12:17,202 --> 0:12:20,5
All I've been doing is saying,
"yes, sir," all morning.


181
0:12:20,5 --> 0:12:22,508
- The captain?
- No, thanks.


182
0:12:22,508 --> 0:12:26,111
Me, I take the captain
<i>cum grano salis.</i>


183
0:12:26,111 --> 0:12:27,98
Remember, I'm like Shakespeare.


184
0:12:27,98 --> 0:12:29,882
With a grain of salt.


185
0:12:29,882 --> 0:12:32,952
I like the old man.
He seems a good skipper.


186
0:12:32,952 --> 0:12:36,555
- I've sailed with him before.
- No, I mean it.


187
0:12:36,555 --> 0:12:39,625
I like the way he talks.
The things he has to say.


188
0:12:39,625 --> 0:12:43,896
I don't know. I just stick to my job here.
I don't mix with the officers.


189
0:12:43,896 --> 0:12:47,466
But I'll be glad to teach you Latin
or take money away from you at cards.


190
0:12:47,466 --> 0:13:9,355
All right. I'll look in on you
after my watch.


191
0:13:9,355 --> 0:13:11,156
Okay, I gotcha.


192
0:13:11,156 --> 0:13:21,5
One forty-two.


193
0:13:21,5 --> 0:13:23,102
One forty-two, sir.


194
0:13:23,102 --> 0:13:25,437
Everything gone well
on your watch, Mr. Merriam?


195
0:13:25,437 --> 0:13:27,39
Everything's fine, sir.


196
0:13:27,39 --> 0:13:29,875
But I think I'll have that hook secured
before I go below.


197
0:13:29,875 --> 0:13:33,312
- We might run into a sea.
- That's fresh paint, Mr. Merriam.


198
0:13:33,312 --> 0:13:35,18
A line will mar it.


199
0:13:35,18 --> 0:13:45,858
- I like a neat ship.
- Yes, sir.


200
0:13:45,858 --> 0:13:49,495
Want that hook made fast, mister?
Might be hard to do if it gets sloppy.


201
0:13:49,495 --> 0:14:11,917
No, Boats. Not yet. Paint's too wet.


202
0:14:11,917 --> 0:14:14,119
Lights are bright, sir.


203
0:14:14,119 --> 0:14:17,22
Better turn in, Tom.
Get some sleep before your watch.


204
0:14:17,22 --> 0:14:22,628
Okay.


205
0:14:22,628 --> 0:14:25,564
Haven't you deck officers
any regard for life and limb?


206
0:14:25,564 --> 0:14:27,366
- Why, that's all right.
- All right?


207
0:14:27,366 --> 0:14:30,569
Why, you fellows could kill a guy
with that. You better secure it.


208
0:14:30,569 --> 0:14:33,772
It's freshly painted.
We don't want to mar the paint.


209
0:14:33,772 --> 0:14:36,775
You'll mar somebody's skull
if you don't do something.


210
0:14:36,775 --> 0:14:41,714
I'll speak to the captain.


211
0:14:41,714 --> 0:14:43,882
- Excuse me, sir...
- lf you want to discuss...


212
0:14:43,882 --> 0:14:46,985
...the hook with me, I've already
given my considered opinion...


213
0:14:46,985 --> 0:15:8,841
...as to the danger involved.


214
0:15:8,841 --> 0:15:26,625
On the bridge. The hook.


215
0:15:26,625 --> 0:15:41,874
Look out! Heads!


216
0:15:41,874 --> 0:15:44,9
- Look out.
- John. John.


217
0:15:44,9 --> 0:15:46,478
You men there, get in and get that hook.


218
0:15:46,478 --> 0:15:50,549
Make fast this end.
I'll fasten it around the hook.


219
0:15:50,549 --> 0:15:52,785
Lower away on that winch.


220
0:15:52,785 --> 0:16:19,711
- I can't. The cable's fouled.
- Get out there and grab that hook.


221
0:16:19,711 --> 0:16:35,127
Put a stopper on that hook, Mr. Merriam.


222
0:16:35,127 --> 0:16:46,672
Well, back to the black hole of Calcutta.


223
0:16:46,672 --> 0:16:49,541
What are you thinking about,
Mr. Merriam?


224
0:16:49,541 --> 0:16:53,378
I think I can tell you.
You're thinking about the hook.


225
0:16:53,378 --> 0:16:55,647
You've made up your mind
that I was negligent.


226
0:16:55,647 --> 0:16:58,717
- That's about it, isn't it?
- Yes, sir, I was thinking that.


227
0:16:58,717 --> 0:17:1,19
You have no right to think that,
you know.


228
0:17:1,19 --> 0:17:4,423
- The responsibility is yours.
- Mine?


229
0:17:4,423 --> 0:17:7,693
I don't see that, sir.
I warned you about the hook.


230
0:17:7,693 --> 0:17:10,162
- I told you twice about it.
- Exactly.


231
0:17:10,162 --> 0:17:12,3
That's what I referred to.


232
0:17:12,3 --> 0:17:15,534
You almost forced me into a position
where I had to show my authority...


233
0:17:15,534 --> 0:17:19,204
...even though it put me in the wrong.
- I didn't see it that way.


234
0:17:19,204 --> 0:17:22,74
But granted I was wrong, sir,
I don't see how you risked...


235
0:17:22,74 --> 0:17:27,246
...the lives of John and the other men.
- I have rights over their lives, Mr. Merriam.


236
0:17:27,246 --> 0:17:29,548
Remember the first day
you came into my office?


237
0:17:29,548 --> 0:17:31,49
- Only vaguely.
- I told you...


238
0:17:31,49 --> 0:17:33,285
...you had no right to kill that moth...


239
0:17:33,285 --> 0:17:36,455
...because its safety
did not depend on you.


240
0:17:36,455 --> 0:17:38,957
I have the right to do
what I want with the crew...


241
0:17:38,957 --> 0:17:40,926
...because their safety
depends on me.


242
0:17:40,926 --> 0:17:44,863
I stand ready any hour of the day
or night to give my life for their safety...


243
0:17:44,863 --> 0:17:47,299
...and for the safety of this vessel.


244
0:17:47,299 --> 0:17:51,904
And because I do, I have
certain rights of risk over them.


245
0:17:51,904 --> 0:17:55,407
- Now do you understand?
- Yes, sir, I think I understand.


246
0:17:55,407 --> 0:17:56,909
You must understand.


247
0:17:56,909 --> 0:18:2,748
It's the first thing you have
to learn about authority.


248
0:18:2,748 --> 0:18:5,951
This liniment should
have penetrated by now, Peter.


249
0:18:5,951 --> 0:18:9,421
It's always worked like magic
on cows and horses.


250
0:18:9,421 --> 0:18:15,6
And it's the only thing that ever cured
my old man's lumbago.


251
0:18:15,6 --> 0:18:23,702
It's the liniment plus a kind of hypnotism
or something I got in my hands.


252
0:18:23,702 --> 0:18:27,706
There. How is that?
You feel okay now, don't you?


253
0:18:27,706 --> 0:18:31,91
It's the other side
where the pain is, Jim.


254
0:18:31,91 --> 0:18:35,814
You mean to tell me you've just been
laying there letting me rub on this side...


255
0:18:35,814 --> 0:18:40,252
...when it's there?


256
0:18:40,252 --> 0:18:43,989
Mr. Merriam. I was working on him...


257
0:18:43,989 --> 0:18:48,56
...but I just touched him there,
and he passed right out.


258
0:18:48,56 --> 0:18:52,3
Has he ever complained
of pain here before?


259
0:18:52,3 --> 0:18:55,968
<i>Panama calling</i> Altair.
<i>Is the patient under anesthetic?</i>


260
0:18:55,968 --> 0:19:1,64
<i>Altair</i> to Panama. Patient is asleep,
breathing very heavily.


261
0:19:1,64 --> 0:19:5,277
<i>If the patient is completely anesthetized,</i>
<i>you may proceed.</i>


262
0:19:5,277 --> 0:19:10,449
<i>Are you ready?</i>


263
0:19:10,449 --> 0:19:13,385
<i>Altair</i> to Panama. We are ready.


264
0:19:13,385 --> 0:19:15,87
<i>Panama to</i> Altair.


265
0:19:15,87 --> 0:19:18,957
<i>Captain Stone will bring his right hand</i>
<i>to the point which we have already...</i>


266
0:19:18,957 --> 0:19:21,493
<i>... established as the region</i>
<i>of the appendix.</i>


267
0:19:21,493 --> 0:19:31,69
<i>Place the point of the scalpel</i>
<i>exactly on this spot.</i>


268
0:19:31,69 --> 0:19:33,38
<i>Make the incision.</i>


269
0:19:33,38 --> 0:19:41,179
<i>Incise to a depth of one-quarter inch.</i>


270
0:19:41,179 --> 0:19:58,196
<i>Continue with the incision vertically,</i>
<i>4 inches.</i>


271
0:19:58,196 --> 0:20:0,699
<i>Have you made the incision?</i>


272
0:20:0,699 --> 0:20:8,106
<i>Panama to</i> Altair<i>,</i>
<i>have you made the incision?</i>


273
0:20:8,106 --> 0:20:27,392
<i>Altair</i> to Panama, wait a minute.
We're not ready yet.


274
0:20:27,392 --> 0:20:31,897
<i>Altair</i> to Panama, we are ready.
Please repeat.


275
0:20:31,897 --> 0:20:34,566
<i>Make an incision a quarter</i>
<i>of an inch deep.</i>


276
0:20:34,566 --> 0:20:48,447
<i>Four inches on the vertical line</i>
<i>already described.</i>


277
0:20:48,447 --> 0:21:3,728
<i>Altair</i> to Panama<i>,</i>
the incision has been made.


278
0:21:3,728 --> 0:21:5,831
You're not doing so good
with that, Louie.


279
0:21:5,831 --> 0:21:8,333
The Greek says you got
to be a Greek to play on it.


280
0:21:8,333 --> 0:21:9,734
How do I know I ain't?


281
0:21:9,734 --> 0:21:14,272
How do you know you ain't gonna catch
appendicitis from it?


282
0:21:14,272 --> 0:21:17,642
I heard it's catching.


283
0:21:17,642 --> 0:21:19,678
Wonder how they're getting on.


284
0:21:19,678 --> 0:21:23,648
Me, I've got magnetic hands.
Healing hands.


285
0:21:23,648 --> 0:21:26,284
Still I wouldn't want to be
in the captain's shoes.


286
0:21:26,284 --> 0:21:27,686
It ain't easy.


287
0:21:27,686 --> 0:21:30,755
Hello, Panama. Hello.
Government hospital, Panama.


288
0:21:30,755 --> 0:21:34,159
Dr. Ostglow. Steamship <i>Altair</i>.
Radio operator speaking.


289
0:21:34,159 --> 0:21:36,194
Altair<i>, come in.</i>


290
0:21:36,194 --> 0:21:37,696
Hello, doctor...


291
0:21:37,696 --> 0:21:40,465
...the patient is breathing normally,
heartbeat is good.


292
0:21:40,465 --> 0:21:42,0
Thank you, Dr. Ostglow.


293
0:21:42,0 --> 0:21:44,269
We will continue to follow
with instructions.


294
0:21:44,269 --> 0:21:50,609
Compliments of Captain Stone,
thank you again. <i>Altair</i> signing off.


295
0:21:50,609 --> 0:21:54,913
Tertius, well done. You're a gent.


296
0:21:54,913 --> 0:21:57,282
And you'll be a scholar
if you hang around me.


297
0:21:57,282 --> 0:22:2,821
- Give me a cigarette, will you?
- Sure.


298
0:22:2,821 --> 0:22:7,159
Thanks.


299
0:22:7,159 --> 0:22:10,862
He'll live, God willing.
And no thanks to the captain.


300
0:22:10,862 --> 0:22:13,231
Sparks...


301
0:22:13,231 --> 0:22:16,301
...let's not say anything about this.
- What do you mean?


302
0:22:16,301 --> 0:22:19,604
I mean, let's not tell anyone
the captain didn't do the operation.


303
0:22:19,604 --> 0:22:21,54
- You're crazy.
- But you know how it is.


304
0:22:21,54 --> 0:22:24,509
Some guys don't like the sight of blood
and things like that.


305
0:22:24,509 --> 0:22:26,278
Okay, if you want it that way.


306
0:22:26,278 --> 0:22:27,846
But me...


307
0:22:27,846 --> 0:22:31,149
...l'd like to hear the next conversation
you have with the captain.


308
0:22:31,149 --> 0:22:37,22
One of those talks
he gives on authority.


309
0:22:37,22 --> 0:22:47,766
Mark.


310
0:22:47,766 --> 0:22:57,108
- Can I see you for a moment?
- Yes, sir.


311
0:22:57,108 --> 0:22:59,878
Mr. Merriam, I want
to thank you for yesterday.


312
0:22:59,878 --> 0:23:1,313
That's all right, sir.


313
0:23:1,313 --> 0:23:4,749
- I'd like to thank you and explain.
- You don't have to explain, sir.


314
0:23:4,749 --> 0:23:7,85
There are a lot of people
squeamish about blood.


315
0:23:7,85 --> 0:23:10,789
I'm not squeamish, Mr. Merriam.
I'm not afraid of anything but failure.


316
0:23:10,789 --> 0:23:13,225
That's why I didn't go
through with the operation.


317
0:23:13,225 --> 0:23:15,86
I'm a sea captain.
I know my profession.


318
0:23:15,86 --> 0:23:19,231
But I'm not a doctor,
and I might have failed.


319
0:23:19,231 --> 0:23:22,0
- You see that, don't you, Tom?
- Of course I do, sir.


320
0:23:22,0 --> 0:23:23,468
I knew you'd see it.


321
0:23:23,468 --> 0:23:27,305
Just as I knew the first time I saw you
that you were the man for me.


322
0:23:27,305 --> 0:23:29,808
A man who'd think as I think.


323
0:23:29,808 --> 0:23:35,113
I've not been disappointed.


324
0:23:35,113 --> 0:23:36,715
Oh, hiya, Tertius.


325
0:23:36,715 --> 0:23:38,55
You haven't said anything, Sparks...


326
0:23:38,55 --> 0:23:41,386
...about my having performed
the operation, have you?


327
0:23:41,386 --> 0:23:43,989
I just thought I'd remind you.


328
0:23:43,989 --> 0:23:46,958
- Been talking with the captain again?
- Yeah.


329
0:23:46,958 --> 0:23:50,28
- He's been talking about authority?
- That's right.


330
0:23:50,28 --> 0:23:53,31
He made a lot of sense.
There's something in what he says.


331
0:23:53,31 --> 0:23:55,3
Wasn't much sense
in what he did yesterday.


332
0:23:55,3 --> 0:23:57,669
- He explained all that.
- Yeah, I'll bet.


333
0:23:57,669 --> 0:24:0,71
He's a smooth man with the words,
the captain.


334
0:24:0,71 --> 0:24:2,807
Now, wait a minute, Sparks.
You've got him all wrong.


335
0:24:2,807 --> 0:24:6,44
He's the first older man
who's treated me like a friend...


336
0:24:6,44 --> 0:24:9,147
...and that means something.
- Yeah, I know.


337
0:24:9,147 --> 0:24:10,882
I can see your way of thinking.


338
0:24:10,882 --> 0:24:14,519
You had a tough time when you
were a kid. Not much friendliness.


339
0:24:14,519 --> 0:24:15,987
But, Tom...


340
0:24:15,987 --> 0:24:21,92
...there's a friendliness that tries
to get you to thinking wrong.


341
0:24:21,92 --> 0:24:22,994
But that's got nothing to do with me.


342
0:24:22,994 --> 0:25:2,567
We're bound south. It's a long voyage,
and I have to tend radio.


343
0:25:2,567 --> 0:25:5,37
If you guys want any more,
you can get it yourself.


344
0:25:5,37 --> 0:25:9,708
Okay, Stew.


345
0:25:9,708 --> 0:25:13,511
Boats, the captain's complaining
about the way the deck's being kept.


346
0:25:13,511 --> 0:25:15,68
It ain't as spick-and-span as I'd like it.


347
0:25:15,68 --> 0:25:18,683
We're shorthanded with Jensen dead
and the Greek in his berth.


348
0:25:18,683 --> 0:25:20,785
The boy's taking turns
standing double watches.


349
0:25:20,785 --> 0:25:24,222
Yeah. Can't help that.
The captain wants a clean ship.


350
0:25:24,222 --> 0:25:40,71
Aye, aye, sir.


351
0:25:40,71 --> 0:25:41,506
You're crazy.


352
0:25:41,506 --> 0:25:45,143
Whoever heard of a captain putting
into port just because one man's dead...


353
0:25:45,143 --> 0:25:48,713
...and one man's off-duty? I've been
to sea since I've been a boy.


354
0:25:48,713 --> 0:25:50,749
I've never heard of anything like that.


355
0:25:50,749 --> 0:25:53,51
That's because most sailors
don't know the law.


356
0:25:53,51 --> 0:25:56,254
With the Greek sick, captain
should port to fill up the crew.


357
0:25:56,254 --> 0:26:0,625
Why, you told me yourself
that the captain is the law at sea.


358
0:26:0,625 --> 0:26:2,16
That's the way it used to be.


359
0:26:2,16 --> 0:26:5,964
Now they got new laws, and they say
the captain's got to put into port...


360
0:26:5,964 --> 0:26:8,133
...to fill up his crew on a coastwise trip.


361
0:26:8,133 --> 0:26:9,534
Never heard of it.


362
0:26:9,534 --> 0:26:12,337
Why don't you tell all that
to the captain yourself?


363
0:26:12,337 --> 0:26:15,106
- Who wants to bet I don't dare?
- I'll bet 1000 bucks.


364
0:26:15,106 --> 0:26:19,477
You four-flushers wouldn't bet
10 real cents.


365
0:26:19,477 --> 0:26:27,452
Put up or shut up.


366
0:26:27,452 --> 0:26:30,822
So I felt it only proper to bring
this just complaint of the men...


367
0:26:30,822 --> 0:26:33,491
...to you in person, captain.


368
0:26:33,491 --> 0:26:53,178
You know, there are captains
who might hold this against you, Louie.


369
0:26:53,178 --> 0:26:56,214
Hey, in there, nearly finished?


370
0:26:56,214 --> 0:27:7,759
I'll be there in a minute.


371
0:27:7,759 --> 0:27:13,331
Okay, let her go.


372
0:27:13,331 --> 0:27:42,327
All right. Let her go.


373
0:27:42,327 --> 0:27:45,23
Hey, hold the chain.
The door's locked!


374
0:27:45,23 --> 0:27:53,104
Hold the chain!


375
0:27:53,104 --> 0:28:2,8
Stop it! Stop!


376
0:28:2,8 --> 0:28:18,663
Stop.


377
0:28:18,663 --> 0:28:35,947
Start washing down.
I'll take a look at the locker.


378
0:28:35,947 --> 0:28:41,953
What's wrong?


379
0:28:41,953 --> 0:28:45,623
You'd better get a couple of men
down here and get that cleaned up.


380
0:28:45,623 --> 0:28:48,126
- It's Louie.
- He was a troublemaker.


381
0:28:48,126 --> 0:28:51,29
But he was a nice guy. Always kidding.


382
0:28:51,29 --> 0:28:53,64
You're impressed.


383
0:28:53,64 --> 0:28:55,266
Death is so absolute.


384
0:28:55,266 --> 0:28:58,636
You looked into the chain locker,
no more Louie.


385
0:28:58,636 --> 0:29:0,772
No more insolent remarks.


386
0:29:0,772 --> 0:29:3,141
No more danger
to the discipline of the ship.


387
0:29:3,141 --> 0:29:6,1
- You didn't like him.
- Of course I didn't like him.


388
0:29:6,1 --> 0:29:8,846
He was a sea lawyer,
full of windy complaints...


389
0:29:8,846 --> 0:29:10,715
...seasoned with bad comedy.


390
0:29:10,715 --> 0:29:12,517
So you shut the hatch.


391
0:29:12,517 --> 0:29:14,719
Shut the hatch?


392
0:29:14,719 --> 0:29:19,924
- What do you mean, Mr. Merriam?
- The hatch was shut.


393
0:29:19,924 --> 0:29:21,426
And I think it was locked.


394
0:29:21,426 --> 0:29:23,561
You accuse me
of doing this out of spite...


395
0:29:23,561 --> 0:29:25,53
...because the man was insubordinate?


396
0:29:25,53 --> 0:29:29,567
This is what you meant when you said
you had rights over the lives of the crew.


397
0:29:29,567 --> 0:29:33,37
- You murdered him.
- You're a little hasty, Mr. Merriam.


398
0:29:33,37 --> 0:29:36,174
You can't expect me just to stand by
and watch you kill a man.


399
0:29:36,174 --> 0:29:46,718
What do you propose to do?
Denounce me?


400
0:29:46,718 --> 0:29:49,854
May I speak to you, Mr. Bowns,
on a matter of great importance?


401
0:29:49,854 --> 0:29:51,255
What is it?


402
0:29:51,255 --> 0:29:54,826
What is the law about
an incompetent captain, Mr. Bowns?


403
0:29:54,826 --> 0:29:58,162
Why interrupt me with a question
like that when you see I'm working?


404
0:29:58,162 --> 0:30:1,499
You know the answer.
The first officer would take over.


405
0:30:1,499 --> 0:30:4,569
I think the captain is incompetent.


406
0:30:4,569 --> 0:30:8,39
Louie getting killed in the chain locker,
that wasn't an accident.


407
0:30:8,39 --> 0:30:10,108
The captain did it purposely.


408
0:30:10,108 --> 0:30:12,777
I don't know what you're trying
to pull, fella.


409
0:30:12,777 --> 0:30:18,383
But my advice is, pull in your ears before
you get yourself into a jam you don't like.


410
0:30:18,383 --> 0:30:20,18
Now get away from me. I'm busy.


411
0:30:20,18 --> 0:30:23,655
- But, Mr. Bowns, I'm not joking.
- You heard me.


412
0:30:23,655 --> 0:30:39,704
And I'm the first officer.


413
0:30:39,704 --> 0:30:43,708
- Hey, what's wrong, kid?
- The captain's crazy, Sparks.


414
0:30:43,708 --> 0:30:45,61
Sure the captain's crazy.


415
0:30:45,61 --> 0:30:49,38
Anyone who'd ride one hobbyhorse
so hard is bound to be bugs.


416
0:30:49,38 --> 0:30:52,35
And what a hobby to pick, authority.


417
0:30:52,35 --> 0:30:56,254
Well, I'm glad you believe me.
Bowns practically threw me off the ship.


418
0:30:56,254 --> 0:30:59,59
Sure. The captain's a little tetched.


419
0:30:59,59 --> 0:31:4,28
This isn't a gag. I mean it.
He's really crazy. Insane.


420
0:31:4,28 --> 0:31:7,331
Hey, now, you know,
well, most people are.


421
0:31:7,331 --> 0:31:11,636
But he killed Louie. That wasn't an accident
in the chain locker. That was murder.


422
0:31:11,636 --> 0:31:14,439
You know, kid. You might be
a little excited yourself.


423
0:31:14,439 --> 0:31:17,675
- Well, let me tell you from the beginning...
- Not me. Don't tell me.


424
0:31:17,675 --> 0:31:19,577
I like my job, and I want to keep it.


425
0:31:19,577 --> 0:31:22,8
When we get to port,
I'll tell the company agent.


426
0:31:22,8 --> 0:31:23,481
You'll lose your job.


427
0:31:23,481 --> 0:31:25,783
Even if I believed you,
I'd advise you not to.


428
0:31:25,783 --> 0:31:27,385
You can't mean that, Sparks.


429
0:31:27,385 --> 0:31:30,755
I believe in keeping my nose clean.
Really clean.


430
0:31:30,755 --> 0:31:32,59
And out of other people's business.


431
0:31:32,59 --> 0:31:35,126
- That's the only way to get along.
- Not me.


432
0:31:35,126 --> 0:31:37,962
When something's wrong,
I've got to do something about it.


433
0:31:37,962 --> 0:32:9,26
I'm going to report this
when we get ashore.


434
0:32:9,26 --> 0:32:13,231
All right.


435
0:32:13,231 --> 0:32:16,701
Report to the captain. San Sebastián
light, 2 points off the port bow.


436
0:32:16,701 --> 0:32:37,755
Yes, sir.


437
0:32:37,755 --> 0:32:44,529
All fast, sir.


438
0:32:44,529 --> 0:32:47,999
- Hello, Will. It's good to see you.
- Always good to see you, Charlie.


439
0:32:47,999 --> 0:32:50,701
- This is my first officer, Mr. Bowns.
- Mr. Bowns.


440
0:32:50,701 --> 0:32:52,67
- Mr. Roberts.
- My third, Mr. Merriam.


441
0:32:52,67 --> 0:32:55,273
- How do you do, sir?
- Mr. Roberts is our agent here.


442
0:32:55,273 --> 0:32:57,842
This your first voyage to this port,
Mr. Merriam?


443
0:32:57,842 --> 0:33:2,213
- Yes. In fact, it's my first long voyage.
- Drop into the office, I'll get you a guide.


444
0:33:2,213 --> 0:33:4,582
- Thank you.
- Be sure and take him up on that.


445
0:33:4,582 --> 0:33:7,118
The Dunham Line may be strict
aboard ship...


446
0:33:7,118 --> 0:33:10,354
...but you'll find it friendly on shore.
- Drop by the office.


447
0:33:10,354 --> 0:33:50,661
Thank you.


448
0:33:50,661 --> 0:33:54,498
I'm glad you accepted my invitation
so promptly, Mr. Merriam.


449
0:33:54,498 --> 0:33:55,933
Thank you.


450
0:33:55,933 --> 0:33:59,3
Actually, I'd like to have
a few words with you, Mr. Roberts...


451
0:33:59,3 --> 0:34:2,39
...on a matter of great importance.
- Of course. Sit down.


452
0:34:2,39 --> 0:34:4,41
- Thank you.
- Make yourself comfortable.


453
0:34:4,41 --> 0:34:10,114
- All right, Jose, you can go now.
- Yes, sir.


454
0:34:10,114 --> 0:34:13,184
Well, Mr. Merriam,
what is the matter of importance?


455
0:34:13,184 --> 0:34:15,86
It's about Captain Stone, sir.


456
0:34:15,86 --> 0:34:18,289
An old friend.
A great friend of mine, Mr. Merriam.


457
0:34:18,289 --> 0:34:20,258
That makes it all the more difficult.


458
0:34:20,258 --> 0:34:22,894
What I have to tell you
is extremely unpleasant.


459
0:34:22,894 --> 0:34:24,295
And not the captain.


460
0:34:24,295 --> 0:34:27,498
Mr. Merriam himself gave
the order not to stopper the hook.


461
0:34:27,498 --> 0:34:30,868
To my mind, Mr. Merriam had been
working kind of hard or something.


462
0:34:30,868 --> 0:34:34,505
This is my first voyage with Captain Stone
as it is the for all the crew...


463
0:34:34,505 --> 0:34:38,943
...except Mr. Bowns, the radio operator and
the steward. And all the men are agreed...


464
0:34:38,943 --> 0:34:40,945
...the captain...
- That will do, Boats.


465
0:34:40,945 --> 0:34:43,748
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Thank you.


466
0:34:43,748 --> 0:34:49,387
Billy Radd.


467
0:34:49,387 --> 0:34:52,256
I'd like to hear what
you have to say about the captain.


468
0:34:52,256 --> 0:34:54,692
I'd like to know if you think
him competent...


469
0:34:54,692 --> 0:34:58,62
...or if he had anything to do
with the death of Louie Carter.


470
0:34:58,62 --> 0:35:1,866
No, sir. It's like the others said,
we just can't understand it.


471
0:35:1,866 --> 0:35:3,534
The captain is a good captain.


472
0:35:3,534 --> 0:35:6,17
What you call a kind man
and a gentleman.


473
0:35:6,17 --> 0:35:8,94
And Mr. Merriam,
he was always a fine gentleman.


474
0:35:8,94 --> 0:35:13,444
- We all liked Mr. Merriam too.
- That'll do for now, Billy. Thank you.


475
0:35:13,444 --> 0:35:18,95
If I could have your permission, I would like
to mention just one thing, Mr. Roberts, sir.


476
0:35:18,95 --> 0:35:21,752
The captain here hasn't only given us
the best food...


477
0:35:21,752 --> 0:35:24,889
...and looked after the ship
his own self at all times...


478
0:35:24,889 --> 0:35:27,692
...but he saved my life
by that operation at sea.


479
0:35:27,692 --> 0:35:33,564
And I never in my life can forget that.


480
0:35:33,564 --> 0:35:38,69
Should I call in any more witnesses,
Mr. Merriam?


481
0:35:38,69 --> 0:35:41,172
You men may be a little puzzled
by what's been going on here.


482
0:35:41,172 --> 0:35:43,24
Mr. Merriam made certain statements.


483
0:35:43,24 --> 0:35:47,445
I called this informal hearing
to prove to him how unfounded they were.


484
0:35:47,445 --> 0:35:49,847
I felt it my duty
as the company agent...


485
0:35:49,847 --> 0:35:53,451
...to prevent public investigation
of a baseless charge.


486
0:35:53,451 --> 0:35:58,656
Thank you all
for cooperating so splendidly.


487
0:35:58,656 --> 0:36:14,472
Have a good time.


488
0:36:14,472 --> 0:36:24,515
I'm sorry this had to happen, Tom.


489
0:36:24,515 --> 0:36:26,65
Ellen will be wanting to see you.


490
0:36:26,65 --> 0:36:29,72
I'm sure she's been waiting for you
since she saw the <i>Altair...</i>


491
0:36:29,72 --> 0:36:31,956
...come into the harbor last night.


492
0:36:31,956 --> 0:36:33,891
Ellen?


493
0:36:33,891 --> 0:36:40,698
- Does she watch for my ship?
- She's always watching for your ship.


494
0:36:40,698 --> 0:36:57,281
She's got good news.


495
0:36:57,281 --> 0:36:59,183
Is Captain Stone aboard?


496
0:36:59,183 --> 0:37:2,319
No, ma'am. He'll be back
in an hour or so. He's with Mr. Roberts.


497
0:37:2,319 --> 0:37:5,56
You're the new third officer,
aren't you?


498
0:37:5,56 --> 0:37:7,258
I was, but how did you know?


499
0:37:7,258 --> 0:37:11,462
Captain Stone wrote me about you.
A long letter even before he met you.


500
0:37:11,462 --> 0:37:14,532
He was most enthusiastic
about your training ship record.


501
0:37:14,532 --> 0:37:15,933
I know.


502
0:37:15,933 --> 0:37:18,669
I'm Ellen Roberts,
an old friend of the captain.


503
0:37:18,669 --> 0:37:21,605
Because of his letters,
I feel as if I knew you too.


504
0:37:21,605 --> 0:37:23,841
- Tom Merriam.
- How do you do?


505
0:37:23,841 --> 0:37:26,143
Where in the world
are you going with that bag?


506
0:37:26,143 --> 0:37:28,345
Doesn't the <i>Altair</i>
sail tomorrow night?


507
0:37:28,345 --> 0:37:30,614
She sails without me, Ms. Roberts.


508
0:37:30,614 --> 0:37:33,117
That sounds serious.


509
0:37:33,117 --> 0:37:35,953
While I'm waiting,
won't you let me give you a lift?


510
0:37:35,953 --> 0:37:38,923
- Then you can tell me all about it.
- No, thank you.


511
0:37:38,923 --> 0:37:42,66
That bag will be awfully heavy
by the time you reach the hotel.


512
0:37:42,66 --> 0:38:14,258
- Come along.
- All right.


513
0:38:14,258 --> 0:38:17,695
And so you're dreadfully disappointed
and dreadfully hurt.


514
0:38:17,695 --> 0:38:20,264
The whole world seems
to have turned against you...


515
0:38:20,264 --> 0:38:24,235
...just because you made a mistake.
- I didn't make a mistake.


516
0:38:24,235 --> 0:38:26,971
That's almost the captain's voice, Tom.


517
0:38:26,971 --> 0:38:29,807
"I didn't make a mistake."
"I couldn't make a mistake."


518
0:38:29,807 --> 0:38:32,776
"I'm authority." "I'm the captain."


519
0:38:32,776 --> 0:38:35,546
"I'm the third officer."


520
0:38:35,546 --> 0:38:37,848
I've heard it all so often.


521
0:38:37,848 --> 0:38:39,583
It's all so wrong.


522
0:38:39,583 --> 0:38:42,186
You're just like the captain, Tom.


523
0:38:42,186 --> 0:38:44,688
Lonely, austere, bitter.


524
0:38:44,688 --> 0:38:46,79
Without family or friends.


525
0:38:46,79 --> 0:38:51,495
Condemning yourself to a bloodless,
ghost-like existence.


526
0:38:51,495 --> 0:38:55,266
And in the end, it will be
only a ghost ship you will command.


527
0:38:55,266 --> 0:38:57,735
How long do you think
I've known the captain, Tom?


528
0:38:57,735 --> 0:38:59,336
I don't know.


529
0:38:59,336 --> 0:39:2,173
I've known him for 15 years.


530
0:39:2,173 --> 0:39:6,577
For 15 years, I've tried to give him love
instead of loneliness.


531
0:39:6,577 --> 0:39:8,512
You mustn't be like him.


532
0:39:8,512 --> 0:39:11,315
You've got to embrace warmth and life.


533
0:39:11,315 --> 0:39:15,186
- A good joke, a pretty girl.
- I don't know any girls.


534
0:39:15,186 --> 0:39:18,122
That's clear enough, but you will.


535
0:39:18,122 --> 0:39:20,724
I have a younger sister in San Pedro.


536
0:39:20,724 --> 0:39:22,96
She's a secretary for the Dunham Line.


537
0:39:22,96 --> 0:39:26,997
She'll meet you on your next trip north.
I'll see to that.


538
0:39:26,997 --> 0:39:29,8
If you don't like her,
she'll introduce you to other girls...


539
0:39:29,8 --> 0:39:32,803
...and other young men.
Young men who don't even know...


540
0:39:32,803 --> 0:39:35,439
...what the word "authority" means.


541
0:39:35,439 --> 0:39:38,842
I'll see that you don't become
another Captain Stone.


542
0:39:38,842 --> 0:39:40,911
I'm going to change him too.


543
0:39:40,911 --> 0:39:43,113
I can now.


544
0:39:43,113 --> 0:39:54,58
I have the right.


545
0:39:54,58 --> 0:39:57,962
But this is not like you, Will.
I've never known you to hold grudges.


546
0:39:57,962 --> 0:40:1,966
I don't want him on my ship.


547
0:40:1,966 --> 0:40:5,69
People seem to be turning against me.


548
0:40:5,69 --> 0:40:7,37
The boy...


549
0:40:7,37 --> 0:40:9,94
...some of the crew.


550
0:40:9,94 --> 0:40:12,576
I feel their dislike.


551
0:40:12,576 --> 0:40:15,212
- Their distrust.
- Oh, nonsense.


552
0:40:15,212 --> 0:40:16,88
You're only imagining things.


553
0:40:16,88 --> 0:40:19,25
You work too hard, too long, Will.


554
0:40:19,25 --> 0:40:22,486
This voyage down without
a second officer, standing watches.


555
0:40:22,486 --> 0:40:23,954
It's been hard on you.


556
0:40:23,954 --> 0:40:28,325
When you get back to the States,
have a good checkup. Take a rest.


557
0:40:28,325 --> 0:40:32,129
It isn't my health that I'm worried about.


558
0:40:32,129 --> 0:40:34,265
I've lived a lonely life.


559
0:40:34,265 --> 0:40:36,333
A hard life.


560
0:40:36,333 --> 0:40:38,902
You and Ellen are the only friends
I've ever had.


561
0:40:38,902 --> 0:40:47,177
All you need's a rest.
See a good doctor, just as I've said.


562
0:40:47,177 --> 0:40:49,179
You'll see Ellen tonight.


563
0:40:49,179 --> 0:40:52,549
Find new interests.


564
0:40:52,549 --> 0:40:56,86
There are no new interests.


565
0:40:56,86 --> 0:40:58,856
Just authority.


566
0:40:58,856 --> 0:41:11,802
Authority.


567
0:41:11,802 --> 0:41:15,439
- I have something to tell you, Will.
- That's what Charlie said.


568
0:41:15,439 --> 0:41:19,743
I wanted to be here,
aboard the <i>Altair</i>, when I told you.


569
0:41:19,743 --> 0:41:23,647
I want my rival
to hear and feel my triumph.


570
0:41:23,647 --> 0:41:26,25
I've always loved your fancies, Ellen.


571
0:41:26,25 --> 0:41:28,519
This isn't a fancy.


572
0:41:28,519 --> 0:41:32,756
I want the old <i>Altair</i> to know
that I'm a free woman.


573
0:41:32,756 --> 0:41:37,294
That I can take you from her
and keep you from her.


574
0:41:37,294 --> 0:41:41,65
- You won your case.
- Yes. He finally gave in.


575
0:41:41,65 --> 0:41:43,801
The final papers came through last week.


576
0:41:43,801 --> 0:41:51,709
I'm a free woman.


577
0:41:51,709 --> 0:41:57,481
I expected a different response, Will.


578
0:41:57,481 --> 0:42:0,751
I thought we were both waiting for this.


579
0:42:0,751 --> 0:42:2,953
I had waited.


580
0:42:2,953 --> 0:42:5,489
I had wanted this.


581
0:42:5,489 --> 0:42:9,126
But now there's little I can do or say.


582
0:42:9,126 --> 0:42:10,994
I'm afraid.


583
0:42:10,994 --> 0:42:14,431
- Afraid of me, Will?
- Of my mind, Ellen.


584
0:42:14,431 --> 0:42:15,899
I don't trust it anymore.


585
0:42:15,899 --> 0:42:18,402
- Your mind?
- Don't come close to me. Stand there.


586
0:42:18,402 --> 0:42:20,504
But, Will, I...


587
0:42:20,504 --> 0:42:23,974
I remember Captain Blaker of the <i>Ajax.</i>


588
0:42:23,974 --> 0:42:26,543
She's my first ship.


589
0:42:26,543 --> 0:42:29,213
I was a mess boy.


590
0:42:29,213 --> 0:42:32,983
I watched him lose his mind,
little by little.


591
0:42:32,983 --> 0:42:37,2
He knew it
and could do nothing about it.


592
0:42:37,2 --> 0:42:40,657
It was awful, Ellen.
I've never forgotten it.


593
0:42:40,657 --> 0:42:43,961
We were run down
in a fog off the coast of the Mersey.


594
0:42:43,961 --> 0:42:46,997
The <i>Ajax</i> sank like a rock.


595
0:42:46,997 --> 0:42:48,432
Blaker went with her.


596
0:42:48,432 --> 0:42:49,867
He was lucky.


597
0:42:49,867 --> 0:42:52,369
It's only your memory
that frightens you.


598
0:42:52,369 --> 0:42:53,804
It's more than that.


599
0:42:53,804 --> 0:42:57,341
I felt strange.


600
0:42:57,341 --> 0:43:2,12
Why, I've done things
that I couldn't remember doing.


601
0:43:2,12 --> 0:43:6,25
I've had moments that I felt
that I was on the verge...


602
0:43:6,25 --> 0:43:8,852
...of losing control.


603
0:43:8,852 --> 0:43:13,257
Doing some terrible, stupid, ugly thing.


604
0:43:13,257 --> 0:43:15,692
This morning, when the boy
testified against me...


605
0:43:15,692 --> 0:43:23,233
...I could barely keep my seat.


606
0:43:23,233 --> 0:43:26,403
Give me a chance to get over this.


607
0:43:26,403 --> 0:43:29,44
This feeling that I don't know myself.


608
0:43:29,44 --> 0:43:39,349
That I don't control my thoughts,
my actions.


609
0:43:39,349 --> 0:43:43,62
You can have all the time
in the world.


610
0:43:43,62 --> 0:43:51,195
I'll be waiting here
for the <i>Altair</i> on her return voyage.


611
0:43:51,195 --> 0:44:1,371
I'm a British subject,
and I'll not sing for you or any Heinie.


612
0:44:1,371 --> 0:44:9,46
- Mr. Merriam.
- What goes on here? What are you up to?


613
0:44:9,46 --> 0:44:10,747
Are you hurt, Mr. Merriam?


614
0:44:10,747 --> 0:44:12,95
This man is my officer from the <i>Altair.</i>


615
0:44:12,95 --> 0:45:22,219
He's been hurt.
I've got to get him back aboard.


616
0:45:22,219 --> 0:45:25,722
Naturally, had I had anything to say
about it, I wouldn't be here.


617
0:45:25,722 --> 0:45:39,169
Evidently, Billy had the policeman
bring me aboard.


618
0:45:39,169 --> 0:45:43,407
Of course, sir, I realize I have no right
whatsoever to be aboard the <i>Altair.</i>


619
0:45:43,407 --> 0:45:56,186
I'll be glad to make arrangements to pay
my passage when we reach San Pedro.


620
0:45:56,186 --> 0:45:59,289
I don't wanna be aboard
any more than you want me here.


621
0:45:59,289 --> 0:46:1,191
But I can't do anything about it.


622
0:46:1,191 --> 0:46:3,226
You can't expect me to swim.


623
0:46:3,226 --> 0:46:5,629
That's quite the wrong tone, Merriam.


624
0:46:5,629 --> 0:46:9,266
I was just gonna say
that you'd be my guest on the trip north.


625
0:46:9,266 --> 0:46:11,34
That you'll have no duties.


626
0:46:11,34 --> 0:46:14,972
We'll do everything to make the voyage
as comfortable as possible.


627
0:46:14,972 --> 0:46:16,807
- Thank you.
- In fact, Merriam...


628
0:46:16,807 --> 0:46:19,109
...l'm rather glad that you're onboard.


629
0:46:19,109 --> 0:46:22,446
It will give me a chance to prove
certain theories of mine.


630
0:46:22,446 --> 0:46:26,75
You know, I'm sure you'll find them
very interesting and instructive.


631
0:46:26,75 --> 0:46:29,953
- You can learn many things from me.
- I never doubted that, sir.


632
0:46:29,953 --> 0:46:32,789
I'm sure you never doubted it
when you told Mr. Roberts...


633
0:46:32,789 --> 0:46:35,192
...that I was a murderer
and incompetent.


634
0:46:35,192 --> 0:46:37,861
But we'll forget all that, Mr. Merriam.


635
0:46:37,861 --> 0:46:41,31
- Thank you, captain.
- Mr. Merriam.


636
0:46:41,31 --> 0:46:51,441
You know, there are some captains
who would hold this against you.


637
0:46:51,441 --> 0:46:52,909
Oh, Raphael.


638
0:46:52,909 --> 0:47:5,489
I was wondering
if you got me to bed last...


639
0:47:5,489 --> 0:47:6,89
Hiya, Sparks.


640
0:47:6,89 --> 0:47:10,27
- I seem to have gotten myself in a kind of...
- Don't come in here.


641
0:47:10,27 --> 0:47:12,262
I don't want any funny business
with you.


642
0:47:12,262 --> 0:47:14,631
Look, Sparks, we're friends.


643
0:47:14,631 --> 0:47:17,501
I need your help. Stop kidding
and listen to me, will you?


644
0:47:17,501 --> 0:47:20,871
Yeah, I'll stop kidding.
But as for listening...


645
0:47:20,871 --> 0:47:24,274
...I tell you I'm dead serious,
and I don't wanna hear a word you say.


646
0:47:24,274 --> 0:47:27,911
Captain's gonna kill me, Sparks.
I can see it in his face.


647
0:47:27,911 --> 0:47:30,47
I'm not too dumb a guy now, Sparks.


648
0:47:30,47 --> 0:47:32,315
I'm not yellow. I'm not hysterical.


649
0:47:32,315 --> 0:47:35,118
I'm telling you he's gonna kill me,
and I need your help.


650
0:47:35,118 --> 0:47:37,32
That is hogwash.


651
0:47:37,32 --> 0:47:38,855
At least do me one favor.


652
0:47:38,855 --> 0:47:41,358
Send a wireless to Ms. Roberts
in San Sebastián.


653
0:47:41,358 --> 0:47:45,495
I can't do that. Captain's forbidden all
wireless unless he personally okays them.


654
0:47:45,495 --> 0:47:48,31
Don't you see?
That's part of what I meant.


655
0:47:48,31 --> 0:52:38,321
Yeah?


656
0:52:38,321 --> 0:52:39,789
Hold it.


657
0:52:39,789 --> 0:52:42,859
Move and you'll get a bullet
through your abdomen.


658
0:52:42,859 --> 0:52:45,695
Not a pleasant or quick death.


659
0:52:45,695 --> 0:52:49,199
Perhaps you've never seen
a man die that way.


660
0:52:49,199 --> 0:52:51,601
But I want you to live.


661
0:52:51,601 --> 0:52:55,405
I want you to learn the great lesson
that I thought I'd taught you.


662
0:52:55,405 --> 0:52:58,742
Authority cannot be questioned.


663
0:52:58,742 --> 0:53:2,12
That's crazy talk.


664
0:53:2,12 --> 0:53:6,75
I never felt more sane in my life
than I do at this moment.


665
0:53:6,75 --> 0:53:8,318
Who's crazy?


666
0:53:8,318 --> 0:53:11,221
You, who defied me and are helpless...


667
0:53:11,221 --> 0:53:14,424
...or I, who control your destiny
and the destiny of the <i>Altair</i>...


668
0:53:14,424 --> 0:53:17,594
...and all the lives onboard?
- I wish Bowns...


669
0:53:17,594 --> 0:53:20,53
I wish the crew could see
what I see now.


670
0:53:20,53 --> 0:53:23,233
- Could hear you talk.
- You think I'm insane?


671
0:53:23,233 --> 0:53:25,902
Yes. And they would too
if they could see you now.


672
0:53:25,902 --> 0:53:27,537
Raving and ranting.


673
0:53:27,537 --> 0:53:29,572
I am captain.


674
0:53:29,572 --> 0:53:31,841
As long as I wear these stripes...


675
0:53:31,841 --> 0:53:35,812
...there isn't a man in the crew
that'll believe you or help you.


676
0:53:35,812 --> 0:53:38,81
You'll find them too lazy...


677
0:53:38,81 --> 0:53:40,16
...too cowardly...


678
0:53:40,16 --> 0:53:42,18
...too disinterested.


679
0:53:42,18 --> 0:53:44,788
That's what I want you
to learn, Merriam.


680
0:53:44,788 --> 0:53:47,457
Men are worthless cattle.


681
0:53:47,457 --> 0:53:48,892
And a few men...


682
0:53:48,892 --> 0:53:51,494
...are given authority to drive them.


683
0:53:51,494 --> 0:53:55,65
You can't prove that to me
even with a gun, captain.


684
0:53:55,65 --> 0:53:57,333
I know people aren't that way.


685
0:53:57,333 --> 0:53:59,502
They're good, kind.


686
0:53:59,502 --> 0:54:1,438
They help each other.


687
0:54:1,438 --> 0:54:3,807
It's only hard
to get them to understand.


688
0:54:3,807 --> 0:54:6,609
I'll give you a chance
to make them understand.


689
0:54:6,609 --> 0:54:8,445
You go out there.


690
0:54:8,445 --> 0:54:10,58
Go anyplace you want onboard ship.


691
0:54:10,58 --> 0:54:12,15
Talk to them.


692
0:54:12,15 --> 0:54:14,484
See if you can get them to help you.


693
0:54:14,484 --> 0:54:18,121
See if they'll stand up
with you against authority.


694
0:54:18,121 --> 0:54:21,624
Why, even your friend Sparks
won't help you.


695
0:54:21,624 --> 0:54:24,427
Go ahead. Get out.


696
0:54:24,427 --> 0:54:26,896
Try and get help against me.


697
0:54:26,896 --> 0:54:29,232
Try. Try.


698
0:54:29,232 --> 0:54:32,402
Try.


699
0:54:32,402 --> 0:54:42,312
But, Jim, can't you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?


700
0:54:42,312 --> 0:54:44,28
But Louie was your pal.


701
0:54:44,28 --> 0:54:46,282
The best friend you had onboard.


702
0:54:46,282 --> 0:54:49,152
How do you think your pal was caught
in the chain locker?


703
0:54:49,152 --> 0:54:51,488
Do you think that door closed itself?


704
0:54:51,488 --> 0:54:53,389
If you take my advice...


705
0:54:53,389 --> 0:54:57,46
...you'll quit trying to start
trouble around here.


706
0:54:57,46 --> 0:54:59,996
Boats, you're a sensible man.


707
0:54:59,996 --> 0:55:3,466
Quit trying to stir up trouble
with the crew against the old man.


708
0:55:3,466 --> 0:55:26,322
They don't like it. They don't like you.
And did you ever hear about mutiny?


709
0:55:26,322 --> 0:55:35,98
Good morning, Mr. Bowns.


710
0:55:35,98 --> 0:56:14,3
There isn't any lock on my cabin door.
I was wondering if you could put one on.


711
0:56:14,3 --> 0:56:31,321
Since you have no earthly need
of this...


712
0:56:31,321 --> 0:56:33,156
Listen, Tom.


713
0:56:33,156 --> 0:56:35,858
You'll only get anyone
you try to talk to in Dutch.


714
0:56:35,858 --> 0:56:38,328
- Now, why don't you be a good guy...
- Get this.


715
0:56:38,328 --> 0:56:40,196
I'm desperate, Sparks.


716
0:56:40,196 --> 0:56:42,999
- Why is the lock on my...?
- I don't know anything.


717
0:56:42,999 --> 0:56:45,335
There's only one thing
you can do to please me.


718
0:56:45,335 --> 0:56:48,37
And that's staying away from me
and not talking to me.


719
0:56:48,37 --> 0:56:50,24
Seems to me the captain
is being decent...


720
0:56:50,24 --> 0:56:53,376
...after what you...
- But it's true. I've got to convince you.


721
0:56:53,376 --> 0:56:56,12
Or someone.
The captain's a homicidal maniac.


722
0:56:56,12 --> 0:57:30,847
We've got to...


723
0:57:30,847 --> 0:57:47,297
- Get this off right away.
- Yes, sir.


724
0:57:47,297 --> 0:57:50,767
<i>I know this man's trouble.</i>


725
0:57:50,767 --> 0:57:54,17
<i>I've seen the captain's hatred.</i>


726
0:57:54,17 --> 0:57:56,139
<i>I know...</i>


727
0:57:56,139 --> 0:57:58,141
<i>... and I will watch.</i>


728
0:57:58,141 --> 0:58:15,692
<i>I will watch.</i>


729
0:58:15,692 --> 0:58:26,369
Hiya, Tertius. Close the door.


730
0:58:26,369 --> 0:58:28,471
I don't get this.


731
0:58:28,471 --> 0:58:31,974
"Tom Merriam not aboard <i>Altair.</i>
Regards."


732
0:58:31,974 --> 0:58:34,844
Why would the captain
want to send this to Mr. Roberts?


733
0:58:34,844 --> 0:58:36,346
I don't know.


734
0:58:36,346 --> 0:58:39,816
And because I don't know
I'm beginning to believe your story, Tom.


735
0:58:39,816 --> 0:58:44,2
This is a reply to a message
sent by Roberts asking if you're aboard.


736
0:58:44,2 --> 0:58:46,155
The way I figure it, maybe you're right.


737
0:58:46,155 --> 0:58:48,358
Maybe the captain intends
to get rid of you.


738
0:58:48,358 --> 0:58:52,95
- Now you know, are you going to help me?
- Yeah.


739
0:58:52,95 --> 0:58:54,397
I'm gonna take this to Bowns
in the morning.


740
0:58:54,397 --> 0:58:57,333
It'll be enough to get him
to listen to you anyhow.


741
0:58:57,333 --> 0:59:2,71
Meanwhile, you better get some rest.


742
0:59:2,71 --> 1:0:5,968
- So long, Tertius.
- So long, and thanks.


743
1:0:5,968 --> 1:0:9,505
- Do you know how to operate the wireless?
- Yes, sir.


744
1:0:9,505 --> 1:0:17,747
If you don't mind, I'd like you to get up
and send a message for me.


745
1:0:17,747 --> 1:0:20,65
I beg your pardon, sir,
but why can't Sparks send it?


746
1:0:20,65 --> 1:0:32,628
The message I'm asking you to send
will answer that question.


747
1:0:32,628 --> 1:0:36,32
Can you read, Finn?


748
1:0:36,32 --> 1:0:52,949
What do you want the paper for?


749
1:0:52,949 --> 1:1:5,862
I'm ready, sir.


750
1:1:5,862 --> 1:1:10,433
This is a lie. You killed him.
You knew he was gonna help me.


751
1:1:10,433 --> 1:1:20,676
Why, you...


752
1:1:20,676 --> 1:1:25,848
You killed him. I know you killed him.


753
1:1:25,848 --> 1:1:28,551
He killed Sparks. Let me go.


754
1:1:28,551 --> 1:1:31,387
He didn't fall overboard.
Captain Stone killed him.


755
1:1:31,387 --> 1:1:34,624
Just as he killed Louie.
Just as he wants to kill me.


756
1:1:34,624 --> 1:1:37,727
I tell you he's crazy.
Can't you understand? He's crazy.


757
1:1:37,727 --> 1:1:41,397
Mr. Merriam may be giving us a clue
as to what's wrong with him.


758
1:1:41,397 --> 1:1:43,533
- You mean the boy is...?
- It's the captain.


759
1:1:43,533 --> 1:1:45,868
- He's mad.
- I don't know how you describe...


760
1:1:45,868 --> 1:1:49,939
...conduct such as this, Mr. Bowns.
- Let me go. Please let me go.


761
1:1:49,939 --> 1:1:52,408
He killed my friend. He killed Louie.


762
1:1:52,408 --> 1:1:55,645
Maybe we ought to have him restrained
so he won't hurt himself.


763
1:1:55,645 --> 1:2:2,985
Get a rope. Truss him up
and put him in his bunk.


764
1:2:2,985 --> 1:2:7,857
What's all the excitement?


765
1:2:7,857 --> 1:2:11,861
You couldn't be telling.


766
1:2:11,861 --> 1:2:15,731
That's fine, boys. That's enough.


767
1:2:15,731 --> 1:2:19,902
Better give him a sedative.
Here's a needle all made up.


768
1:2:19,902 --> 1:2:24,4
- Think he needs it?
- He looks pretty bad. It might quiet him.


769
1:2:24,4 --> 1:2:26,475
Yes, sir.


770
1:2:26,475 --> 1:2:28,778
No.


771
1:2:28,778 --> 1:2:30,346
Please, Mr. Bowns.


772
1:2:30,346 --> 1:2:33,816
Mr. Bowns, please. No.


773
1:2:33,816 --> 1:2:45,94
Mr. Bowns, please.


774
1:2:45,94 --> 1:2:47,763
No, Mr. Bowns.


775
1:2:47,763 --> 1:3:15,491
Please.


776
1:3:15,491 --> 1:3:55,31
What do you want?


777
1:3:55,31 --> 1:3:58,634
That's an odd message, surely.
Can't make head nor tail of it.


778
1:3:58,634 --> 1:4:2,71
With the boy here and alive.
Maybe the boy is right.


779
1:4:2,71 --> 1:4:4,807
I don't know. Orders is orders.


780
1:4:4,807 --> 1:4:8,644
I had the boy tied up
and gave him a sedative.


781
1:4:8,644 --> 1:4:10,846
Maybe he ain't the crazy one at that.


782
1:4:10,846 --> 1:4:14,316
- You deck officers have your problem.
- Yeah.


783
1:4:14,316 --> 1:4:17,653
It's going to be the problem
with you fellas as well as mine.


784
1:4:17,653 --> 1:4:20,79
After me, you're next in rank,
and you gotta help me...


785
1:4:20,79 --> 1:4:30,366
...if the boy is right.


786
1:4:30,366 --> 1:4:32,501
<i>If the boy is right.</i>


787
1:4:32,501 --> 1:4:33,903
<i>If the boy is right.</i>


788
1:4:33,903 --> 1:4:35,638
<i>If the boy is right.</i>


789
1:4:35,638 --> 1:4:38,74
<i>If the boy is right.</i>


790
1:4:38,74 --> 1:4:40,843
<i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>


791
1:4:40,843 --> 1:4:43,245
<i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>


792
1:4:43,245 --> 1:4:45,347
<i>Maybe the boy is right.</i>


793
1:4:45,347 --> 1:4:47,483
<i>Maybe the boy is right.</i>


794
1:4:47,483 --> 1:5:8,204
<i>Maybe the boy is right.</i>


795
1:5:8,204 --> 1:5:10,639
<i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>


796
1:5:10,639 --> 1:5:13,375
<i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>


797
1:5:13,375 --> 1:5:20,316
<i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>


798
1:5:20,316 --> 1:5:22,985
<i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>


799
1:5:22,985 --> 1:5:25,387
<i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>


800
1:5:25,387 --> 1:5:27,823
<i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>


801
1:5:27,823 --> 1:5:29,959
<i>Maybe the boy is right.</i>


802
1:5:29,959 --> 1:5:33,696
<i>Maybe the boy is right.</i>


803
1:5:33,696 --> 1:5:35,831
<i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>


804
1:5:35,831 --> 1:5:39,68
<i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>


805
1:5:39,68 --> 1:6:3,492
<i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>


806
1:6:3,492 --> 1:6:6,295
Mac, we gotta do
something about this.


807
1:6:6,295 --> 1:6:9,298
We can't let things stay this way.


808
1:6:9,298 --> 1:7:55,4
I don't know.


809
1:7:55,4 --> 1:7:59,308
<i>The boy is safe.</i>


810
1:7:59,308 --> 1:8:5,814
<i>And his belief in men</i>
<i>and men's essential goodness is secure.</i>


811
1:8:5,814 --> 1:8:12,855
<i>He stands beside me in command.</i>


812
1:8:12,855 --> 1:8:14,556
<i>All is well.</i>


813
1:8:14,556 --> 1:8:19,929
Lights are bright, sir.


814
1:8:19,929 --> 1:8:37,78
<i>And we are homeward bound</i>
<i>to San Pedro.</i>


815
1:8:37,78 --> 1:8:39,515
- For luck.
- Thank you, sir.


816
1:8:39,515 --> 1:8:42,451
Being a sailor, you'll need luck.


817
1:8:42,451 --> 1:8:44,353
You're a sailor, all right, sir.


818
1:8:44,353 --> 1:8:48,19
I don't need eyes to tell me
you're a seaman outward bound.


819
1:8:48,19 --> 1:8:56,65
Oh, Mr. Merriam. Mr. Merriam.


820
1:8:56,65 --> 1:8:59,668
Mr. Merriam, my sister Ellen
asked me to meet your ship.


821
1:8:59,668 --> 1:9:1,7
How do you do?


822
1:9:1,7 --> 1:9:16,452
Yes, she told me all about you.


823
1:9:16,452 --> 1:11:16,452
