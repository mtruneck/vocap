1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:14,89



2
0:0:14,89 --> 0:0:17,46
ERIC KOSTON: Things started to
get a little different over at


3
0:0:17,46 --> 0:0:19,99
World with Rocco.


4
0:0:19,99 --> 0:0:24,33
He was always able to throw
money around and, oh, if you


5
0:0:24,33 --> 0:0:26,9
do this, I'll give you
$100, and he'd just


6
0:0:26,9 --> 0:0:28,32
have a wad of cash.


7
0:0:28,32 --> 0:0:33,72
After a time, it was fun, we
would always get cash off him.


8
0:0:33,72 --> 0:0:36,2
Being young, we didn't
trust him.


9
0:0:36,2 --> 0:0:40,1
Everyone started to mutually
feel that way, but never did


10
0:0:40,1 --> 0:0:43,36
we get to the source of it and
talk it out and, hey, Rocco,


11
0:0:43,36 --> 0:0:46,97
man, are you ripping us off?


12
0:0:46,97 --> 0:0:50,2
None of us were old enough or
responsible enough to confront


13
0:0:50,2 --> 0:0:50,88
something like that.


14
0:0:50,88 --> 0:0:53,22
It's like, oh, no,
I'm convinced.


15
0:0:53,22 --> 0:0:53,66
Fuck that dude.


16
0:0:53,66 --> 0:0:55,93
Let's bounce, and that was it.


17
0:0:55,93 --> 0:0:57,93
TIM GAVIN: We were riding
for Blind at the time.


18
0:0:57,93 --> 0:1:2,38
I remember in '92, that's when
he started to hang out more


19
0:1:2,38 --> 0:1:7,15
with Guy, and Rudy,
and me, and Henry.


20
0:1:7,15 --> 0:1:10,35
And then I would bring the dude
up to LA periodically.


21
0:1:10,35 --> 0:1:13,85
And I don't know when Eric
really got the cool


22
0:1:13,85 --> 0:1:15,1
card with the crew.


23
0:1:15,1 --> 0:1:16,38
I don't know when
that happened.


24
0:1:16,38 --> 0:1:18,98



25
0:1:18,98 --> 0:1:19,44
I don't--


26
0:1:19,44 --> 0:1:22,3
I think it was we evolved
as friends during


27
0:1:22,3 --> 0:1:23,7
those Plan B years.


28
0:1:23,7 --> 0:1:26,3
In that two year span, we
all got really close.


29
0:1:26,3 --> 0:1:28,11
GUY MARIANO: We started going
up to San Diego to hang out


30
0:1:28,11 --> 0:1:30,55
with Eric and skate with Eric,
and I think Eric was coming


31
0:1:30,55 --> 0:1:32,0
down here a little bit more.


32
0:1:32,0 --> 0:1:35,44
I did a lot of World Park days
with Eric, and that was


33
0:1:35,44 --> 0:1:38,264
interesting because if you've
ever seen Eric skate a skate


34
0:1:38,264 --> 0:1:39,36
park, it's amazing.


35
0:1:39,36 --> 0:1:42,63
And you can only imagine him
at a super young age just


36
0:1:42,63 --> 0:1:43,99
really going for it.


37
0:1:43,99 --> 0:1:46,77
I remember when we started Girl,
we were actually off of


38
0:1:46,77 --> 0:1:49,66
Wilshire at Macy's, this
ledge off stairs.


39
0:1:49,66 --> 0:1:54,33
And it was me, Tim, Henry
Sanchez, and Eric, and Rick


40
0:1:54,33 --> 0:1:56,6
was telling us he's thinking
about starting this company


41
0:1:56,6 --> 0:1:58,34
and he wanted all of
us to ride for it.


42
0:1:58,34 --> 0:2:2,2
ERIC KOSTON: I remembering
me and Guy going, sure.


43
0:2:2,2 --> 0:2:4,69
Let's do it.


44
0:2:4,69 --> 0:2:6,57
Didn't really even
second guess it.


45
0:2:6,57 --> 0:2:7,68
That would be awesome.


46
0:2:7,68 --> 0:2:10,139
AARON MEZA: I heard about it
that weekend they came out at


47
0:2:10,139 --> 0:2:10,85
the contest.


48
0:2:10,85 --> 0:2:13,61
Mike York was like, everybody
just quit World.


49
0:2:13,61 --> 0:2:15,0
They all started this company.


50
0:2:15,0 --> 0:2:16,57
ERIC KOSTON: What's funny is
that that Back to the City


51
0:2:16,57 --> 0:2:20,8
contest, in SF, I was already
up there just skating.


52
0:2:20,8 --> 0:2:20,59
And [INAUDIBLE]


53
0:2:20,59 --> 0:2:23,866
came up to the contest, and
then I wanted to tell him.


54
0:2:23,866 --> 0:2:28,425
And he just looked at me and he
goes, are you leaving too?


55
0:2:28,425 --> 0:2:29,98
And I was like, yeah.


56
0:2:29,98 --> 0:2:32,67
And he was like, all right.


57
0:2:32,67 --> 0:2:33,64
The team was sick.


58
0:2:33,64 --> 0:2:36,49
It was all the dudes that we
hung out and skated with


59
0:2:36,49 --> 0:2:38,82
anyway, so it was perfect.


60
0:2:38,82 --> 0:2:41,11
TIM GAVIN: I was the last
dude to get on Girl.


61
0:2:41,11 --> 0:2:43,305
Eric was definitely on before
me, because I was the last


62
0:2:43,305 --> 0:2:44,555
dude on, literally.


63
0:2:44,555 --> 0:2:47,66



64
0:2:47,66 --> 0:2:49,66
I really befriended Eric.


65
0:2:49,66 --> 0:2:51,83
We just became tighter.


66
0:2:51,83 --> 0:2:54,67
He moved up to LA, and
we moved in together.


67
0:2:54,67 --> 0:2:57,43



68
0:2:57,43 --> 0:2:58,86
I think we were the only
dudes that had an


69
0:2:58,86 --> 0:3:1,18
apartment in our crew.


70
0:3:1,18 --> 0:3:2,91
MIKE CARROLL: His house was
definitely the crash pad.


71
0:3:2,91 --> 0:3:5,19
It was just staying up until
like 5:00 in the morning


72
0:3:5,19 --> 0:3:9,13
playing "Mortal Kombat" and
then getting up at 2:00 or


73
0:3:9,13 --> 0:3:13,62
3:00 in the afternoon, going and
eating burritos, and then


74
0:3:13,62 --> 0:3:19,33
maybe hit a spot that day and
skate, and then just do that


75
0:3:19,33 --> 0:3:20,58
same old thing.


76
0:3:20,58 --> 0:3:23,15



77
0:3:23,15 --> 0:3:24,53
ERIC KOSTON: We were one of
the first ones to have a


78
0:3:24,53 --> 0:3:30,2
place, so it's the play
house, basically.


79
0:3:30,2 --> 0:3:36,25
It's the place that there's no
adults, and we started to


80
0:3:36,25 --> 0:3:40,6
drink a bit and want
to get chicks.


81
0:3:40,6 --> 0:3:45,14
I feel like Schner was the one
who brought the Arizona


82
0:3:45,14 --> 0:3:46,611
drinking aspect into it.


83
0:3:46,611 --> 0:3:49,44



84
0:3:49,44 --> 0:3:51,88
TIM GAVIN: He never was
interested in drinking or


85
0:3:51,88 --> 0:3:54,6
smoking pot, but whenever
he did, he was a


86
0:3:54,6 --> 0:3:55,62
total fucking disaster.


87
0:3:55,62 --> 0:3:58,475
I remember this one time he
fucking drank, and I think it


88
0:3:58,475 --> 0:4:0,93
was the first time he smoked
weed, and he ate a box of


89
0:4:0,93 --> 0:4:4,68
Cheez Its, and just
fucking threw up.


90
0:4:4,68 --> 0:4:5,82
The entire house was
fucking orange.


91
0:4:5,82 --> 0:4:7,7
MIKE CARROLL: I forget who it
was, but someone walked in on


92
0:4:7,7 --> 0:4:12,3
Eric on all fours on his bed
after drinking Jaeger or


93
0:4:12,3 --> 0:4:15,7
something like that, just
puking onto his bed.


94
0:4:15,7 --> 0:4:17,79
It was that age for everyone.


95
0:4:17,79 --> 0:4:19,48
Everyone's first drinking
experience, drinking the


96
0:4:19,48 --> 0:4:21,73
shittiest Cisco and
all that shit.


97
0:4:21,73 --> 0:4:23,71
MALE SPEAKER: People were
telling me about Mike York


98
0:4:23,71 --> 0:4:24,96
pissing in one of your shoes.


99
0:4:24,96 --> 0:4:27,19



100
0:4:27,19 --> 0:4:28,8
That was a story that came up.


101
0:4:28,8 --> 0:4:29,384
ERIC KOSTON: Dude, I still
have the shoe.


102
0:4:29,384 --> 0:4:30,372
MALE SPEAKER: No.


103
0:4:30,372 --> 0:4:31,36
ERIC KOSTON: Yeah.


104
0:4:31,36 --> 0:4:33,32
York, what the fuck
are you doing?


105
0:4:33,32 --> 0:4:37,36
And he just mumbled and he was
just like [MUMBLES], and his


106
0:4:37,36 --> 0:4:40,21
back's to me, so he's
just like [MUMBLE].


107
0:4:40,21 --> 0:4:42,87
TIM GAVIN: Apparently Mike
York does that a lot.


108
0:4:42,87 --> 0:4:47,55
I guess he's known to take a
walk sleeping and piss in


109
0:4:47,55 --> 0:4:48,31
random places.


110
0:4:48,31 --> 0:4:50,54
Eric was so devastated
about this piss in


111
0:4:50,54 --> 0:4:51,61
his Air-Pacs, man.


112
0:4:51,61 --> 0:4:53,67
It was fucking hilarious.


113
0:4:53,67 --> 0:4:55,34
I mean, fuck, those were
our college years.


114
0:4:55,34 --> 0:4:58,27
Those were fraternities,
our dorm rooms.


115
0:4:58,27 --> 0:5:0,71
I would do anything to get back
there and be living with


116
0:5:0,71 --> 0:5:2,39
Eric again.


117
0:5:2,39 --> 0:5:5,18
It was lame, but it was the best
times of our lives, dude.


118
0:5:5,18 --> 0:5:7,67
GUY MARIANO: We would wake up in
the morning, he'd make egg


119
0:5:7,67 --> 0:5:11,83
McMuffin sandwiches for
everybody and coffee.


120
0:5:11,83 --> 0:5:13,32
He's the man.


121
0:5:13,32 --> 0:5:14,18
It was Koston, dude.


122
0:5:14,18 --> 0:5:17,13
Koston used to make me breakfast
every morning, and


123
0:5:17,13 --> 0:5:19,77
for that matter, like
five other people.


124
0:5:19,77 --> 0:5:22,25
AARON MEZA: I wouldn't even
be like, hey dude, is


125
0:5:22,25 --> 0:5:23,42
it cool if I stay?


126
0:5:23,42 --> 0:5:24,33
We'd all stay there.


127
0:5:24,33 --> 0:5:26,31
Mike Carroll, York, everybody.


128
0:5:26,31 --> 0:5:28,19
We'd stay there forever.


129
0:5:28,19 --> 0:5:31,413
I mean, if you know Eric, he's
super generous, but I don't


130
0:5:31,413 --> 0:5:33,85
think he necessarily wanted a
lot of people staying at his


131
0:5:33,85 --> 0:5:37,7
house and making a mess
of the place.


132
0:5:37,7 --> 0:5:41,6
He's not like fucking come
one, come all, fuck yeah,


133
0:5:41,6 --> 0:5:42,14
party at my house.


134
0:5:42,14 --> 0:5:45,88
He was just dealing with it
because he's so nice.


135
0:5:45,88 --> 0:5:48,14
I mean, he would come pick me up
at the airport and we'd go


136
0:5:48,14 --> 0:5:50,28
skate, and it was
just for years.


137
0:5:50,28 --> 0:5:54,362
Seriously, since "Goldfish"
through the "Chocolate" tour I


138
0:5:54,362 --> 0:5:55,72
stayed at his house.


139
0:5:55,72 --> 0:5:59,27



140
0:5:59,27 --> 0:6:2,49
MALE SPEAKER: Where did you
start actually taking a part


141
0:6:2,49 --> 0:6:3,34
really serious?


142
0:6:3,34 --> 0:6:4,5
Or have you always?


143
0:6:4,5 --> 0:6:7,97
ERIC KOSTON: It was probably
"Goldfish" or really wanted to


144
0:6:7,97 --> 0:6:9,9
get a good part.


145
0:6:9,9 --> 0:6:11,23
Because that was Girl's
first video, too.


146
0:6:11,23 --> 0:6:14,98
I wanted to make sure we
had a really sick video


147
0:6:14,98 --> 0:6:15,79
when it came out.


148
0:6:15,79 --> 0:6:18,23
Everybody did, just to
back the company.


149
0:6:18,23 --> 0:6:24,81



150
0:6:24,81 --> 0:6:26,62
TONY FERGUSON: It
was definitely


151
0:6:26,62 --> 0:6:30,27
mellower, not as intense.


152
0:6:30,27 --> 0:6:34,72
It was more of a friendly, fun
vibe, and I think that's what


153
0:6:34,72 --> 0:6:36,34
Mike and Rick wanted
to portray.


154
0:6:36,34 --> 0:6:38,5
It was everyone skating
together.


155
0:6:38,5 --> 0:6:41,22
We would go skate the
same spot everyday.


156
0:6:41,22 --> 0:6:42,47
We'd be at the courthouse.


157
0:6:42,47 --> 0:6:51,56



158
0:6:51,56 --> 0:6:58,372
That was just to take it
back to funner times.


159
0:6:58,372 --> 0:6:59,83
MALE SPEAKER: Do you remember
the first time


160
0:6:59,83 --> 0:7:0,81
you filmed with him?


161
0:7:0,81 --> 0:7:3,11
AARON MEZA: I remember filming a
line with him at [INAUDIBLE]


162
0:7:3,11 --> 0:7:6,24
that was super long with
tons of hard tricks.


163
0:7:6,24 --> 0:7:10,12
I think he backside heelflips
over a wall in "Goldfish." I


164
0:7:10,12 --> 0:7:12,8
just couldn't believe how
much good stuff was in


165
0:7:12,8 --> 0:7:15,14
it how long it was.


166
0:7:15,14 --> 0:7:17,63
I wouldn't necessarily say every
time we went out we got


167
0:7:17,63 --> 0:7:20,165
something, but it's pretty
obvious he was definitely


168
0:7:20,165 --> 0:7:21,81
fucking so naturally talented.


169
0:7:21,81 --> 0:7:24,75
I think the most naturally
talented skater ever.


170
0:7:24,75 --> 0:7:27,6
Back then when he was young and
carefree and only had to


171
0:7:27,6 --> 0:7:34,76
skate, it was a joke how
he could do anything.


172
0:7:34,76 --> 0:7:39,89
SAM SMYTH: And now I see
more people like that.


173
0:7:39,89 --> 0:7:43,6
I feel like, at the time, he
might have been the only one


174
0:7:43,6 --> 0:7:48,3
that I've ever seen work that
way or skate that way, where


175
0:7:48,3 --> 0:7:49,85
he could do anything
that he dreamt of.


176
0:7:49,85 --> 0:7:56,21



177
0:7:56,21 --> 0:7:58,42
ATIBA JEFFERSON: Back then, it
didn't seem like skateboarding


178
0:7:58,42 --> 0:8:0,74
was his main focus.


179
0:8:0,74 --> 0:8:4,7
It seemed like being a young
kid was his main focus.


180
0:8:4,7 --> 0:8:8,22
I mean, I really watched
skating turn


181
0:8:8,22 --> 0:8:9,47
into his main priority.


182
0:8:9,47 --> 0:8:12,4



183
0:8:12,4 --> 0:8:13,48
"Mouse," you saw it.


184
0:8:13,48 --> 0:8:16,91
That part to me is you're
seeing, oh, he's finally


185
0:8:16,91 --> 0:8:18,17
taking skating seriously.


186
0:8:18,17 --> 0:8:22,66
He's finally using
his potential.


187
0:8:22,66 --> 0:8:25,98
His "Mouse" part, Eric's part.


188
0:8:25,98 --> 0:8:30,41
His video parts have always
been better and better.


189
0:8:30,41 --> 0:8:31,6
I don't know, dude.


190
0:8:31,6 --> 0:8:32,31
He's just good.


191
0:8:32,31 --> 0:8:37,57



192
0:8:37,57 --> 0:8:41,46
GUY MARIANO: During "Mouse," me
and Eric were really close.


193
0:8:41,46 --> 0:8:43,52
I was definitely living
with him at the time.


194
0:8:43,52 --> 0:8:46,48



195
0:8:46,48 --> 0:8:47,9
I liked being around Eric.


196
0:8:47,9 --> 0:8:50,3
He pushed me on a skateboard.


197
0:8:50,3 --> 0:8:53,82
I think things would have been
a lot different if I didn't


198
0:8:53,82 --> 0:8:55,15
spend a lot of time with Eric.


199
0:8:55,15 --> 0:8:58,31
I don't think I would be as
good of a skateboarder.


200
0:8:58,31 --> 0:9:0,21
Not to say that I was
on Eric's level.


201
0:9:0,21 --> 0:9:2,43
Eric's always been
way above me.


202
0:9:2,43 --> 0:9:5,33
But I looked to Eric for what
was the next thing, and what


203
0:9:5,33 --> 0:9:6,58
was possible.


204
0:9:6,58 --> 0:9:10,53



205
0:9:10,53 --> 0:9:13,47
TONY FERGUSON: Sometimes the
video doesn't give it justice.


206
0:9:13,47 --> 0:9:16,46
[INAUDIBLE], we were skating
down with Eric one time,


207
0:9:16,46 --> 0:9:26,58
because he did five tricks in
10 minutes on this rail.


208
0:9:26,58 --> 0:9:27,4
It was insane.


209
0:9:27,4 --> 0:9:32,7
He did nollie 50-50,
and he was like,


210
0:9:32,7 --> 0:9:33,8
oh, I like this rail.


211
0:9:33,8 --> 0:9:35,8
He did nollie frontside
noseslide, nollie frontside


212
0:9:35,8 --> 0:9:38,9
nose grind, and then nollie
frontside nose blunt.


213
0:9:38,9 --> 0:9:41,34



214
0:9:41,34 --> 0:9:42,54
TIM GAVIN: Everyone
knows Eric's good.


215
0:9:42,54 --> 0:9:45,18
I want to tell this, though.


216
0:9:45,18 --> 0:9:48,29
In the "Mouse" video, when I
did that 50-50, I remember


217
0:9:48,29 --> 0:9:51,657
Eric was trying it too, and I
did that before Eric did, and


218
0:9:51,657 --> 0:9:52,907
it made it in the video.


219
0:9:52,907 --> 0:9:55,53



220
0:9:55,53 --> 0:9:57,6
I had to get that on record.


221
0:9:57,6 --> 0:10:1,67
I mean, I consider Eric one
of my best friends.


222
0:10:1,67 --> 0:10:4,59
I've known the guy for 20 years,
lived with him for 10,


223
0:10:4,59 --> 0:10:7,23
I fucking barely know the guy.


224
0:10:7,23 --> 0:10:9,71
ATIBA JEFFERSON: For a dude who
mumbles and is the worst


225
0:10:9,71 --> 0:10:13,59
guy to talk to on the phone and
have a conversation with,


226
0:10:13,59 --> 0:10:17,99
he really is good at acting
not like himself.


227
0:10:17,99 --> 0:10:21,22
Even the Charlie Chaplin thing,
his personality and


228
0:10:21,22 --> 0:10:23,97
charisma is so good, I'm
very surprised he


229
0:10:23,97 --> 0:10:25,22
didn't go into acting.


230
0:10:25,22 --> 0:10:27,952



231
0:10:27,952 --> 0:10:31,97
SPIKE JONZE: The one with Eric
as Charlie Chaplin, we were


232
0:10:31,97 --> 0:10:33,79
shooting something else
that day, I forget


233
0:10:33,79 --> 0:10:34,57
what we were doing.


234
0:10:34,57 --> 0:10:35,56
Something at the warehouse.


235
0:10:35,56 --> 0:10:37,41
And then we wanted
to do that too.


236
0:10:37,41 --> 0:10:40,85
And the thing that made that
one work is Eric had never


237
0:10:40,85 --> 0:10:42,87
heard of Charlie Chaplin, or I
guess he'd heard of him, but


238
0:10:42,87 --> 0:10:44,51
never seen any of his stuff.


239
0:10:44,51 --> 0:10:48,63
So I bought him a box set of
Charlie Chaplin VHSs, and he


240
0:10:48,63 --> 0:10:50,51
went home and watched it
over and over again.


241
0:10:50,51 --> 0:10:52,5
And OK, here's what makes
Charlie Chaplin funny.


242
0:10:52,5 --> 0:10:57,77
And he went and just sort of
studied his Charlie Chaplin.


243
0:10:57,77 --> 0:11:0,75
I guess, knowing Eric, if he's
going to do something, he's


244
0:11:0,75 --> 0:11:3,27
going to take it seriously.


245
0:11:3,27 --> 0:11:5,23
AARON MEZA: I feel like he's
like a lot of the dudes that


246
0:11:5,23 --> 0:11:7,96
have to do it, he
can pull it off.


247
0:11:7,96 --> 0:11:11,28
They moved into the old
man thing, he was


248
0:11:11,28 --> 0:11:13,35
pretty fine with it.


249
0:11:13,35 --> 0:11:15,64
That's pretty hard to have to do
that stuff, but I feel like


250
0:11:15,64 --> 0:11:18,89
he has done better than some
of the other guys.


251
0:11:18,89 --> 0:11:22,61
Where someone like Tim was
awkward about it, or just way


252
0:11:22,61 --> 0:11:26,35
nervous, I feel like he's always
been pretty good at


253
0:11:26,35 --> 0:11:28,32
that stuff.


254
0:11:28,32 --> 0:11:30,63
SPIKE JONZE: Yeah, we'd done a
set of boards with everyone


255
0:11:30,63 --> 0:11:34,16
old a few years before that, so
it came out of that idea.


256
0:11:34,16 --> 0:11:39,54



257
0:11:39,54 --> 0:11:42,24
Whatever dumb idea that
anyone comes up


258
0:11:42,24 --> 0:11:44,23
with, it's made a reality.


259
0:11:44,23 --> 0:11:51,65



260
0:11:51,65 --> 0:11:53,3
I don't know if they
ever pulled that


261
0:11:53,3 --> 0:11:54,51
out for the box set.


262
0:11:54,51 --> 0:11:56,41
The dailies of that stuff,
I could've just


263
0:11:56,41 --> 0:11:57,26
watched that for an hour.


264
0:11:57,26 --> 0:11:58,89
That stuff's best.


265
0:11:58,89 --> 0:12:0,23
What school are we from?


266
0:12:0,23 --> 0:12:3,77
MALE SPEAKER: We're from Santa
Monica Community College.


267
0:12:3,77 --> 0:12:5,92
SPIKE JONZE: OK, Santa Monica,
what about Santa Barbara


268
0:12:5,92 --> 0:12:6,13
Community College?


269
0:12:6,13 --> 0:12:7,7
MALE SPEAKER: Santa Monica
City College.


270
0:12:7,7 --> 0:12:9,67
SPIKE JONZE: You stop and you're
sipping your coffee,


271
0:12:9,67 --> 0:12:11,23
and you look up and
down the street.


272
0:12:11,23 --> 0:12:15,41
You see a set of stairs, and
then you get an idea.


273
0:12:15,41 --> 0:12:17,612
You start pushing, and pushing
harder, and pushing harder,


274
0:12:17,612 --> 0:12:20,22
and then racing towards the
stairs and then launch down


275
0:12:20,22 --> 0:12:21,33
the stairs.


276
0:12:21,33 --> 0:12:23,7
And then in slow motion,
close up view with


277
0:12:23,7 --> 0:12:24,528
wind in your hair.


278
0:12:24,528 --> 0:12:27,444



279
0:12:27,444 --> 0:12:31,89
And then you land, come to a
stop, and proudly look back at


280
0:12:31,89 --> 0:12:33,49
the stairs you've conquered
on your wheelchair.


281
0:12:33,49 --> 0:14:33,49
