###2 SHOENICE: Hi.
###3 My name is Shoenice Shoenice, a.k.a., Shoenice22.
###8 A lot of people think I'm a complete idiot.
###10 But actually I'm a professional idiot with
###13 decades of experience.
###15 On your marks, get set, Shoenice.
###19 And I just open up my throat and just something happens,
###23 and I just know.
###24 It's like Evel Knievel jumping over them 20 buses.
###27 He knows he can die.
###28 But once he gets over it, it's epic for life.
###32 Here's to you.
###33 
###46 People must think I'm nuts.
###49 I'm in the right place at the right time to
###51 do whatever I want.
###52 I don't want to be president of the United States.
###54 I'll save the world from the number one YouTube channel.
###57 
###68 It's a nice day today.
###69 A nice day to go swimming.
###71 Maybe we'll go swimming later on.
###74 All I do is travel around the world, you know?
###76 My family threw me out two years ago.
###79 Because they just didn't understand my YouTube career
###83 and what it's all about.
###86 It always seems like I stay in a hotel near a cemetery.
###89 I don't know why.
###90 But like the last four hotels I've been in, I come out in
###94 the morning, and it's daylight, there's a cemetery.
###97 I don't know if God's trying to tell me something.
###99 But either way, Lake George, New York, just
###103 spreading the word.
###104 
###123 We had a great house, great family.
###125 My father and mom had me and my two brothers.
###128 Really good times.
###129 And then just things started changing in the house.
###132 My father wasn't home every night.
###135 And eventually there was a for sale sign out.
###137 And we went from a nice, everybody had their own
###139 bedroom, to like a one-bedroom with my mom who literally just
###144 started drinking from all the problems.
###147 It's been about 35 years.
###150 Nothing's changed.
###152 We just bounced from apartment to apartment.
###154 Because me and my brothers were so crazy that literally
###158 landlords would just say, you're a great lady, but your
###161 kids are psycho.
###163 
###167 What's going on, buddy?
###168 MIKE: How you doing?
###170 SHOENICE: I used to live here as a kid.
###173 Now I'm famous on YouTube, so we're doing a documentary
###176 about my life.
###177 My name's Chris, by the way.
###178 Nice to meet you.
###179 You own this property?
###180 
###185 SHOENICE: Yeah, we played around the garage.
###187 I just always remember we weren't
###188 supposed to go somewhere.
###189 And finally the landlord, maybe it's the one who owned
###191 it, and just said listen, you got three great sons, but
###194 they're animals.
###194 You got to move out.
###196 We weren't bad kids, but we just spray painted the sides
###199 of people's houses.
###200 We don't know why.
###201 We were only seven.
###201 But never did anything bad.
###203 It was nice meeting you.
###205 All right.
###205 Take it easy, man.
###206 
###209 Oh, the old neighborhood--
###212 never changes.
###214 As far back as I can remember, I just was always the kid on
###218 the playground or outside in the yard.
###221 And just everybody in the neighborhood knew I would eat
###223 crazy things.
###224 So I was eating grass at first,
###227 and I'd swallow pebbles.
###230 Then my home economics class, I just started eating the
###232 salt, the baking soda.
###234 And actually, it became such a trending thing in home
###237 economics that they always knew that our group would
###240 never be able to finish the cake or
###242 the muffins or whatever.
###243 Because I already ate half the ingredients.
###246 And then it became just like something that I knew I could
###249 make money off of.
###250 I got three guys from England that don't believe I can drink
###253 three bottles of Budweiser with the tops on them in under
###256 a minute with no hands.
###258 On your mark, get set, Shoenice!
###264 So I was in a high school with gangs and the principal got
###268 his ear half cut-off.
###270 So I knew it was time to go.
###272 My mom said, if you want to quit high school, you have to
###274 join the Army.
###275 And I said, no problem.
###277 So I joined the Army.
###278 I did my basic training.
###279 I did all this other stuff.
###281 Eventually, Baghdad was being bombed in 1991.
###285 I'm watching it with my roommates.
###286 Wow, man, they're tearing shit up.
###288 The phone rings.
###290 Is this Christopher Thomas Schewe, 097 B, B, B, B, B?
###295 So I knew once they said my social security number they
###297 were coming off the IOR list.
###299 So I went out there.
###301 I was food supply.
###303 I basically just fed all the troops food and water as they
###306 came through.
###307 One day there was a sandstorm.
###310 And I found these two little kids buried in
###312 this little sand dune.
###314 I gave them some ravioli and Dinty Moore beef stew.
###317 You could see just the energy come back in them, too.
###320 And just things like that are why I want to make sure no kid
###324 goes to bed hungry anymore in the world.
###327 Now the YouTube community has allowed me to take that next
###331 level into what I've always believed in-- stopping global
###333 hunger for good.
###335 I'm going to explain to you something, to everybody, and
###339 this is the way it is.
###341 My mom told me that someday, Chris, you're
###343 going to save the world.
###345 And she knew it, too, because that's what I'm going to do.
###348 
###353 Actually, my son signed me up for YouTube when he
###356 was eight years old.
###357 I didn't even know that you could have a YouTube channel.
###360 So he was actually the one that signed me up.
###363 And then he said, Dad, the only way you're really going
###365 to let people know that you're on
###367 YouTube is to join Facebook.
###368 So once I posted a YouTube in, and there was 40 views the
###372 next day, I was sold.
###374 I just knew that was the best advertising for whatever you
###377 wanted to sell or believe in.
###379 When I first did YouTube, I just did a joke.
###382 It builds up, and people were suggesting, why don't you do
###385 what you did in high school at the cafeteria table?
###388 You used to take the toilet paper, the napkins, and you'd
###391 eat it all.
###391 I go, OK, I'll do that.
###393 So I did a three-part series where I ate a whole roll of
###396 1,000 sheets of toilet paper in like 10 minutes.
###399 That literally is what blew me up.
###401 And all my eating stunts after Elmer's glue were all requests
###407 from my fans.
###408 
###412 Go to my buddy Nathan's diner, Wakin' Bacon.
###414 I was just here the other day.
###417 I set a new challenge for his menu.
###419 
###422 Hey, there's my buddy Ian!
###423 We know everybody in the town.
###425 How you doing, Ian?
###428 I'm going to come have some breakfast.
###430 How you doing?
###430 IAN: Awesome.
###431 SHOENICE: All right.
###432 What are you looking at?
###434 [INAUDIBLE]
###435 a [INAUDIBLE] drive by.
###436 We just kid around.
###437 The town knows us around here that we don't play games.
###441 Hey everyone, Shoenice again.
###443 Well, basically this is my first
###445 interview as a famous YouTuber--
###448 glazed420, otherwise known as Ian.
###452 Dude's no joke.
###453 Helped me out a lot, he's my friend.
###455 
###463 IAN: And then I found out that he was in [INAUDIBLE]
###469 or something.
###471 He's walking down Lake George, the road.
###474 And I'm like Shoenice!
###476 And then we basically immediately hit it off.
###479 I have a separate YouTube.
###480 It's called glazed420.
###482 I do things like working out, because I do calisthenics.
###486 So I'll do like a minute and a half handstand.
###489 I'll do a bunch of pull-ups.
###491 I do a bunch of goofy videos.
###493 I have one that's pretty viral where I'm getting tased by a
###498 cop at a fish show.
###500 The video went viral-- has about 40,000 views.
###525 SHOENICE: I can't do it anymore!
###526 I can't do it!
###527 I can't do it, Ian!
###528 I can't do it!
###529 Thank you.
###530 Thank you.
###531 
###536 Took the breath right out of me.
###539 I might have looked like a little bitch, but you do it.
###542 
###551 Oh my God, my room keys are in my pants, bro.
###555 JIM: I've known Chris for years.
###556 On and off for 11 years.
###558 And he just recently started staying at the motel and
###560 telling me of his success on YouTube.
###564 People just living at the hotel, it
###566 don't happen too often.
###567 We're against it.
###569 But Chris can stay here any time right now.
###572 Because he'll bring a smile to my face when I'm
###574 having a bad day.
###574 You can't go wrong with that.
###576 IAN: With Shoenice, his style on YouTube, he likes it to be
###581 very simple.
###583 He doesn't want any intro with the letterheads and all that.
###587 He wants it simple and down to the point.
###589 SHOENICE: All right, all right.
###590 I'm ready.
###591 Let's eat some glue today.
###594 Hey, everyone.
###595 Shoenice again.
###597 Well, basically, you're probably wondering why I'm
###599 wearing a microphone right now.
###601 Well, the Vice documentary crew, they actually showed up
###605 here today.
###606 And they're videotaping me right now.
###608 And we got my man Dan.
###610 He's got a bottle of wood glue, and he's going to open
###613 up the top and he's going to pour it in my mouth.
###616 Somebody's actually testing it out.
###620 DAN: Yeah.
###621 SHOENICE: It's glue.
###622 I love you, bro.
###623 On your mark, get set, don't kill me, Shoenice.
###627 
###634 All right, keep going, bro.
###638 Uh huh, all right, go.
###639 Oh man, is it almost done?
###641 DAN: Uh uh.
###642 SHOENICE: Oh, God.
###645 Oh man, not in the face, bro!
###646 Now [INAUDIBLE] is going to want my job!
###648 I got to go out later!
###650 Hold on.
###651 
###654 It's coming out of my nose, hold on.
###658 Water's for pussies, but glue isn't.
###660 All right, man.
###660 Let's finish this up, bro.
###662 
###665 OK, I'd say it's good enough.
###667 I'd say that's good enough, don't you?
###668 DAN: Yeah.
###669 SHOENICE: Time.
###671 Time.
###673 Thank you.
###675 Bomb.
###675 That's how we do a Shoenice vid.
###677 I'm going to go clean myself up.
###679 
###687 How you doing?
###688 Either way, basically what I do is medicinal marijuana.
###691 I've got Crohn's disease.
###693 So either way, this is what I do for my medications instead
###698 of spending thousands of dollars on medicines that give
###700 you more side effects than the actual Crohn's disease.
###703 And I've been in remission for 25 years just smoking
###706 something that comes out of the ground.
###708 So either way, how you doing?
###710 
###714 A lot of people probably don't like me smoking weed and doing
###717 videos for teenage kids.
###719 But I'd rather see a kid smoke a tree than get
###721 wrapped around one.
###722 Let's get rid of the alcohol, you know what I mean?
###725 But then the prisons would be only about 30% full.
###731 This is one of my secrets.
###734 Cranberry juice solves all problems.
###739 All right, all right, let's get this loaded up to YouTube.
###745 Vice documentary on location.
###752 When I started YouTube, I never had an enemy in my life.
###755 So I don't know what it was like to
###756 be like a Rush Limbaugh.
###757 Like all these people just hate you.
###760 A lot of people argue between each other
###762 on my comment boards.
###763 I mean, I'll go back the next day, and they've literally
###766 argued for hours on end over the most stupidest things.
###769 Let me just get a feel for what the people are saying in
###772 the comment board.
###772 I don't think it's going to be anything other than oh my God,
###775 this is incredible.
###777 Bad ass, you.
###777 This is the only time I'm going to say first is best,
###780 love the behind the scenes, Shoenice.
###782 Vice has sunk to a new low.
###784 Blah, whatever.
###787 These are just people that fight over first, actually.
###789 You look so fucking baked, haha.
###791 Awesome, haha, it sounds like you're really enjoying it.
###794 I just think that there's a lot of people out there that
###797 are just jealous of me.
###799 
###802 They want to sit at home and to do what they do.
###805 I get bottles of liquor sent to me.
###807 And I get drunk, and I get paid for it.
###809 It's fun to troll.
###812 IAN: Don't feed the troll.
###813 Don't feed the troll.
###814 But that's what I'm saying.
###815 SHOENICE: Trolling means you say or do things to get a
###821 negative reaction out of someone.
###824 You're just trying to say something just to get them
###826 irked, you know what I mean?
###828 You want one of these?
###829 -Sure.
###830 SHOENICE: You want to eat one?
###831 -Yeah.
###831 SHOENICE: Really?
###832 -Yeah.
###832 SHOENICE: You're going to eat one.
###833 -Yeah.
###833 SHOENICE: You're going to eat one with me?
###835 I'm not opening it.
###836 Oh, you got sugar porn on your lap.
###838 I'm going like this.
###840 -Oh, no!
###841 OK.
###842 SHOENICE: Well you can't eat them-- it keeps
###844 all the sugar together.
###846 Some people have made these fake rest in peace videos.
###849 Like, my brother died trying to-- and it hurts me.
###853 I'm saving a billion children before my heart stops beating.
###856 So if we lose one to a tampon stunt, I just call collateral
###861 damage to be honest with you.
###863 Everybody tries to impersonate their heroes sometime.
###866 And I just have over 5,000 parody vids of people either
###871 hating me, imitating me--
###875 -Shoenice here again.
###877 SHOENICE: Attempting my stunts.
###878 
###881 Just shouting me out.
###882 Or literally they just want to find me and kill me.
###884 I don't understand.
###886 -Shoenice is a fake, everybody.
###888 I just want you guys to know that.
###891 SHOENICE: I took all the beer out of my fridge on the 4th of
###894 July, and I went straight for six years.
###898 And then I started doing YouTube.
###899 I was still straight.
###902 My ex-wife couldn't handle the fame.
###905 So she's like, you've got to go, and I
###906 moved out to the garage.
###908 You can see how I have some garage vids.
###911 And then I just eventually just left the property.
###914 And I knew I wasn't putting my son to bed that
###917 night, so time to drink.
###921 On your mark, get set.
###924 
###928 Everclear.
###929 
###935 Because that's the only reason why I put the bottle down, is
###938 for family.
###940 So without them, I was chaotic again.
###944 
###952 I was homeless for a while.
###953 I did Matchbook stunts.
###955 On your mark, get set, Shoenice!
###958 Hard!
###959 -Look at his tongue.
###960 -I'm all ready.
###961 
###965 SHOENICE: Ha ha, hee haw, bitches!
###967 Every bar banned me.
###969 I mean, I literally couldn't go anywhere.
###971 Hello, everybody.
###972 Shut up.
###973 This is Shoenice22.
###975 I'm going to eat a tampon in under a minute, bro.
###977 I've always been used to living under a roof.
###980 So when I was like thrown out, there was nothing I could do.
###983 I couldn't get to my bank account or whatever.
###986 But I had that specialty of just freaking out people on
###989 the street.
###990 And I could go into a bar flat broke, and I'd walk out with
###993 $400 drunk as a skunk an hour later.
###996 So it worked for me, but there's people out there that
###999 don't have my talent, you know?
###1002 I met this hotel owner that was
###1003 rehabbing all these hotels.
###1005 He actually fed me, gave me a place to do my laundry.
###1009 
###1034 JIM: Yeah, he borrowed my car, went to the store.
###1036 And comes back and it's full of gas, and gave me money, and
###1040 this and that.
###1041 I mean, he's got a big heart.
###1043 He likes to make people happy, I guess.
###1044 SHOENICE: Basically, I'm going to save the
###1046 whole country of Africa.
###1048 So we're going to start practicing
###1049 doing donation drive-bys.
###1051 These people never seen us before behind us, and we're
###1054 going to go surprise this one lady with a $20 bill.
###1056 -You're not a--
###1057 SHOENICE: I'm serious.
###1058 I make money off of Google.
###1059 I know what it's like to be homeless.
###1061 I'm not saying you are, but what we do
###1063 is we help out people.
###1065 All I had was a $20 on me, but this guy Ian, my cameraman, is
###1070 very friendly.
###1070 -Is this going to be on TV?
###1071 SHOENICE: I've been on "Tosh.0," "World's Dumbest." I
###1074 mean, I'm just a crazy fella.
###1077 Hey, we were so poor growing up, my mom used to say, you
###1080 better finish everything on your plate.
###1082 There's people right now starving in the living room.
###1084 
###1088 Get it?
###1090 I think my mom was just a woman that just was too young
###1094 to have three sons on her own.
###1098 Eventually alcohol took over.
###1100 And literally it would be like she would go
###1103 out on a Friday night.
###1105 She wouldn't want to, you know, forget about her kids.
###1108 But she would go into a blackout.
###1110 Obviously, go somewhere other than her home.
###1114 And then the neighbors were wondering when she'd pull in
###1116 like the next afternoon.
###1118 I always was able to suffice when we didn't
###1122 have food in the house.
###1124 If you didn't have a Miracle Whip sandwich, I'd just take
###1128 some sheets off the toilet paper roll.
###1131 I think I still do it to this day.
###1133 It fills your belly.
###1134 But my father eventually came and got us, and times went on.
###1140 See, I don't like to hang out with drunk people.
###1144 My mother was a chronic alcoholic.
###1146 She was a great lady.
###1147 But when I found her dead at 56 on the living room floor, I
###1151 knew she was out of her misery.
###1153 Because she lived off of vodka.
###1156 I guess that's where I get my liquor slamming
###1159 stunts from, you know?
###1161 My mom always had that big bottle of vodka, right
###1166 underneath the kitchen sink next to the dish soap.
###1169 
###1172 I thought it was normal to go to eighth grade in
###1175 a blackout by lunch.
###1176 I mean, we just used to take the whole glass of vodka to
###1181 the bus stop.
###1182 We'd all pass it around and go to school.
###1185 But it'll catch up to you someday.
###1189 It'll catch up to me.
###1192 They sent me a bottle of Devil's Springs, 160 proof--
###1197 30 proof less.
###1199 Now, what I'm going to do is talk to you
###1201 before I slam this bottle.
###1202 Nothing's fake about this.
###1204 I just have a really crazy tolerance for liquor.
###1207 The Devil's Springs was kind of freaky--
###1209 160 proof.
###1211 My friends were there.
###1212 I kind of like was lethargic and passing out, and they
###1216 couldn't wake me up.
###1217 So I woke up actually with a tube down my throat.
###1219 It's the only time I've ever had my stomach pumped.
###1222 And to be honest with you, I was mad.
###1224 Because I didn't have insurance, and I knew that
###1226 tube down my throat was about a $400 procedure.
###1232 Alcohol leads to bad stuff.
###1234 The only two times I ever smoked crack in my life was
###1238 when I was drunk.
###1239 I would never even think about walking down the street
###1243 looking for a bump at 4:00 in the morning going like this.
###1248 IAN: When Shoenice chugs bottles of liquor, I feel
###1252 concerned for his health.
###1253 I don't want to see the guy end up dying from one of his
###1257 drinking stunts.
###1259 And I showed my concern, and a bunch of people on Facebook
###1262 and YouTube have showed the concern.
###1265 So he did one stunt with a bottle of Everclear to end all
###1269 the drinking stunts.
###1271 
###1273 He defeats death in a way.
###1275 You know what I mean?
###1276 Because some of this stuff, normal people
###1278 would die from it.
###1280 And it's just like people like that about
###1284 death-defying things.
###1286 And like wow, he must be some kind of mutant.
###1290 There's something special about Shoenice where he can
###1293 handle that kind of stuff.
###1294 JIM: It's hard for anybody to hear, but then there's smokers
###1297 and stuff like that.
###1299 Life is full of choices, and he's making a choice.
###1301 And do I agree with it?
###1303 No.
###1304 But it's getting him somewhere, isn't it?
###1306 Would I do it?
###1307 No.
###1308 But people do anything for money, they say.
###1311 So if he's getting a little money out of it, that's why
###1315 he's eating glue, and tampons, and everything else.
###1318 SHOENICE: And what I do is I'm basically trying to figure out
###1322 who can really handle being a part of my revolution.
###1326 I got Muslims hanging out with whites from southern Alabama.
###1331 I mean, I've literally had people coming and going
###1333 Shoenice, you saved me from a suicide.
###1335 You brought us back together as a couple.
###1339 And it's just, you're in our lives now, don't never leave.
###1343 Stop all the craziness, because you
###1345 will save the world.
###1346 So I mean, I'm a lot of people's higher power.
###1349 I'm their antidepressant.
###1350 It's just like, where's it going to lead to?
###1353 It scares me sometimes.
###1355 
###1369 SHOENICE: I'm hoping I can stop global hunger in three
###1373 years because I'm getting tired.
###1377 But if I die, I know that there'll be
###1379 people that carry on.
###1380 I'll be a better martyr and a better human on this planet,
###1384 that's a guarantee.
###1386 
###1389 Shoenice!
###1391 Na, ha, ha, hee haw, bitches!
###1395 I own this town!
###1397 You heard me.
###1398 Trying to play dead in the cemetery.
###1402 All right.
###1403 It's a nice day.
###1404 
###1410 [BEEP]
###1410 SHOENICE: Hi, Aaron, it's Shoenice.
###1413 Great job on the documentary.
###1415 I loved everything.
###1416 One thing I would like to take back that I said though, is
###1419 that if a child died imitating one of my stunts on YouTube it
###1423 would be collateral damage towards my revolution.
###1427 Actually, I would like to take that back.
###1429 It would be devastating to me just for me to even think that
###1433 I had any possibility in the way of somebody dying.
###1438 So, yeah, I appreciate you doing my life story.
###1442 It should help me out a lot with my hunger campaign.
###1444 But that was just the one thing I really wish I could
###1448 stick my foot in my mouth on is that comment about
###1451 collateral damage for a teenage kid to die imitating
###1455 one of my stunts.
###1457 Because that would literally break my heart.
###1459 OK.
###1459 Thanks, Aaron.
###1460 But if you keep it in, that's no problem either.
###1463 Documentary's a documentary.
###1465 Ba, ha, ha, ha, hee haw.
###1467 Thank you.
