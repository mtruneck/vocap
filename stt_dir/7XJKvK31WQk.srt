CARL AZUZ, HOST: Hi, I`m Carl Azuz.


2
0:0:14,94 --> 0:0:18,99
And today we`re going to one-up Phineas Fogg.
Instead of 80 days, we`re going around the


3
0:0:18,99 --> 0:0:24,57
world in 80 seconds for some global headlines
at the start of today`s show.


4
0:0:24,57 --> 0:0:29,78
Our first stop is in Syria, where a civil
war is driving hundreds of thousands of people


5
0:0:29,78 --> 0:0:33,539
out of the country. According to estimates
from the United Nations, more than half a


6
0:0:33,539 --> 0:0:38,44
million Syrian refugees have crossed over
the border. They`re looking for safety. They`re


7
0:0:38,44 --> 0:0:43,16
also looking for warmth. And with predictions
for a harsh winter, that could be hard to


8
0:0:43,16 --> 0:0:43,62
find.


9
0:0:43,62 --> 0:0:48,59
Next, we`re heading to China, where some newspaper
journalists are protesting against the government.


10
0:0:48,59 --> 0:0:53,97
They`ve accused officials of censorship and
restricting freedom of the press. Local government


11
0:0:53,97 --> 0:0:58,4
officials aren`t commenting about the situation.
The people you see here are supporting the


12
0:0:58,4 --> 0:1:1,559
journalists laying flowers down at the newspaper`s
headquarters.


13
0:1:1,559 --> 0:1:6,85
Now, we`re going to go to Australia, where
intense heat and strong winds are fueling


14
0:1:6,85 --> 0:1:11,859
the flames of two wildfires. This is happening
on the island of the Tasmania. The first have


15
0:1:11,859 --> 0:1:17,2
destroyed more than 100 homes, but as of late
Sunday night, officials said there hadn`t


16
0:1:17,2 --> 0:1:21,84
been any deaths reported, although they were
looking into reports about potentially missing


17
0:1:21,84 --> 0:1:23,119
people.


18
0:1:23,119 --> 0:1:28,13
Last stop on our global tour, Alaska, where
an oil rig was a little closer to shore than


19
0:1:28,13 --> 0:1:34,679
you might expect -- right up on it. This Royal
Dutch Shell rig ran aground last week. It


20
0:1:34,679 --> 0:1:39,599
happened while it was being towed back to
its winter home. There could be up to 150,000


21
0:1:39,599 --> 0:1:44,499
gallons of diesel on board, but observers
are saying there are no signs that any of


22
0:1:44,499 --> 0:1:46,9
it is leaking out.


23
0:1:46,9 --> 0:1:52,189
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s Shout Out goes
out to Mr. Apfeld`s social studies classes


24
0:1:52,189 --> 0:1:56,459
at All Saint`s Catholic School in Fort Worth,
Texas.


25
0:1:56,459 --> 0:2:0,639
The U.S. Defense secretary`s office is located
in what building?


26
0:2:0,639 --> 0:2:1,499
Here we go now.


27
0:2:1,499 --> 0:2:6,729
Is it at the U.S. Capitol, Pentagon, White
House or Fort Knox?


28
0:2:6,729 --> 0:2:12,26
You`ve got 30 seconds. Go.


29
0:2:12,26 --> 0:2:19,1
The Defense Department`s headquarters is in
the Pentagon, one of the world`s largest office


30
0:2:19,1 --> 0:2:19,72
buildings.


31
0:2:19,72 --> 0:2:24,39
That`s your answer and that`s your Shout Out.


32
0:2:24,39 --> 0:2:29,87
AZUZ: There might be a new person behind that
desk in the Pentagon soon. On Monday, President


33
0:2:29,87 --> 0:2:35,8
Obama announced his nominee to be the next
secretary of Defense, former Senator Chuck


34
0:2:35,8 --> 0:2:40,51
Hagel. He`s a Republican who served 12 years
in the U.S. Senate and he`s also a veteran


35
0:2:40,51 --> 0:2:45,51
who fought in the Vietnam War. If he`s confirmed
as the next Defense secretary, he`ll be the


36
0:2:45,51 --> 0:2:50,98
first enlisted soldier to eventually hold
that office. Hagel has made some controversial


37
0:2:50,98 --> 0:2:55,26
statements in the past and that could lead
to some challenges during his confirmation


38
0:2:55,26 --> 0:2:56,15
process.


39
0:2:56,15 --> 0:3:2,15
Yesterday, the president also nominated John
Brennan to be the next director of the CIA.


40
0:3:2,15 --> 0:3:6,35
Right now, Brennan is the president`s chief
adviser on counter-terrorism. He worked at


41
0:3:6,35 --> 0:3:11,65
the CIA for 25 years, so getting the job as
director could be seen as kind of a homecoming


42
0:3:11,65 --> 0:3:12,4
for him.


43
0:3:12,4 --> 0:3:17,23
And just because President Obama nominates
them doesn`t mean Hagel and Brennan will get


44
0:3:17,23 --> 0:3:22,84
those jobs. We mentioned they have to be confirmed.
And that power belongs to the U.S. Senate.


45
0:3:22,84 --> 0:3:27,33
There will be confirmation hearings, where
senators will get to ask these nominees questions


46
0:3:27,33 --> 0:3:31,85
before deciding whether or not to vote for
them, to approve them for the jobs.


47
0:3:31,85 --> 0:3:36,24
Confirming presidential nominees is one of
the responsibilities that can only be done


48
0:3:36,24 --> 0:3:40,29
by one part of Congress or the other. For
example, the House of Representatives can


49
0:3:40,29 --> 0:3:45,1
decide if a government official should be
put on trial, but the Senate is the group


50
0:3:45,1 --> 0:3:46,5
that holds that trial.


51
0:3:46,5 --> 0:3:50,73
On other things, obviously, the House and
Senate work together, like coming up with


52
0:3:50,73 --> 0:3:51,46
laws.


53
0:3:51,46 --> 0:3:54,28
Yesterday, Athena Jones looked at the issue
of gun control.


54
0:3:54,28 --> 0:3:58,63
Today, she`s putting the focus on another
subject that could be a priority for the new


55
0:3:58,63 --> 0:4:0,34
Congress -- immigration reform.


56
0:4:0,34 --> 0:4:0,6
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


57
0:4:0,6 --> 0:4:3,31
ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):
What might comprehensive legislation look


58
0:4:3,31 --> 0:4:3,55
like?


59
0:4:3,55 --> 0:4:8,47
The president says it should include measures
to beef up border security, punish companies


60
0:4:8,47 --> 0:4:14,38
that purposely hire undocumented workers and
give the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants


61
0:4:14,38 --> 0:4:17,44
here a way to obtain legal status.


62
0:4:17,44 --> 0:4:19,75
Groups that want to restrict immigration are
skeptical.


63
0:4:19,75 --> 0:4:21,88
DAN STEIN, FEDERATION FOR AMERICAN IMMIGRATION
REFORM: The president himself has said he


64
0:4:21,88 --> 0:4:26,9
doesn`t think these laws are enforceable.
How -- how on earth is Congress ever going


65
0:4:26,9 --> 0:4:30,249
to be convinced to pass a package of -- of
the kind he`s talking about when no guarantees


66
0:4:30,249 --> 0:4:32,96
can be made to the general public that the
laws will be respected?


67
0:4:32,96 --> 0:4:37,129
JONES: Doubts that could signal a long road
ahead for this legislative push.


68
0:4:37,129 --> 0:4:40,6
JOHN GRAMLICH, "CQ ROLL CALL": Right now,
what`s interesting on immigration is that


69
0:4:40,6 --> 0:4:44,24
everyone is talking the talk, and that includes
Democrats and Republicans. But, again, there`s


70
0:4:44,24 --> 0:4:46,86
a big difference between talking the talk
and walking the walk on policy.


71
0:4:46,86 --> 0:4:50,629
JONES (on camera): A big question is whether
the parties can agree on how to approach this


72
0:4:50,629 --> 0:4:51,639
immigration issue.


73
0:4:51,639 --> 0:4:55,499
Should it be one big bill, which many Democrats
are pushing?


74
0:4:55,499 --> 0:5:1,58
Or several smaller ones, which many Republicans
favor, because they say this issue is so complex?


75
0:5:1,58 --> 0:5:3,52
Athena Jones, CNN, Washington.


76
0:5:3,52 --> 0:5:5,469
(END VIDEO TAPE)


77
0:5:5,469 --> 0:5:12,8
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can ID me.
I`m an annual celebration that includes parties


78
0:5:12,8 --> 0:5:18,86
and parades. I start on the 12th day after
Christmas and I end on Mardi Gras.


79
0:5:18,86 --> 0:5:28,569
My biggest U.S. celebration is in New Orleans.
I`m Carnival and I occur right before the


80
0:5:28,569 --> 0:5:30,5
season of Lent.


81
0:5:30,5 --> 0:5:32,809
(END VIDEO TAPE)


82
0:5:32,809 --> 0:5:37,99
AZUZ: Carnival season is on in New Orleans
and it runs through Fat Tuesday. One artist


83
0:5:37,99 --> 0:5:42,639
is honoring the city by using items that are
associated with the celebration.


84
0:5:42,639 --> 0:5:47,8
This is a mosaic. It`s a type of art that
uses small items to form a picture or a pattern.


85
0:5:47,8 --> 0:5:52,8
In this case, the artist and his helpers are
using recycled Mardi Gras beads. They`re recreating


86
0:5:52,8 --> 0:5:58,419
a cityscape of New Orleans. And when they`re
finished, the 42-foot wide work of art is


87
0:5:58,419 --> 0:6:3,949
expected to set a new record. All it takes
is one and a half million beads, some very


88
0:6:3,949 --> 0:6:7,729
precise placements and a whole lot of patience.


89
0:6:7,729 --> 0:6:11,889
While Carnival brings huge crowds to New Orleans,
a different event brought tens of thousands


90
0:6:11,889 --> 0:6:16,439
of people right here to Atlanta, Georgia last
week. It`s the Passion Conference, a gathering


91
0:6:16,439 --> 0:6:21,259
of young Christians who are committed to changing
the world, in part by taking on the issue


92
0:6:21,259 --> 0:6:22,8
of human slavery.


93
0:6:22,8 --> 0:6:25,59
Jim Clancy looks at how the movement is gaining
momentum.


94
0:6:25,59 --> 0:6:25,849
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


95
0:6:25,849 --> 0:6:30,249
JIM CLANCY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: (voice-over):
More than 60,000 young Christians from around


96
0:6:30,249 --> 0:6:36,529
the country and around the world held candles
aloft in the frosty air. Their own faces shine


97
0:6:36,529 --> 0:6:42,71
back at them from a massive cube set up outside
the Georgia Dome -- faces of those who have


98
0:6:42,71 --> 0:6:49,289
pledged to light up the world and put an end
to human trafficking in their lifetimes.


99
0:6:49,289 --> 0:6:57,71
BRYSON VOGELTANZ, PASSION 2013: Slavery is
trapped in dark places all over the world.


100
0:6:57,71 --> 0:7:2,819
It`s trapped here in Atlanta in the shadows.
It`s in the shadows in Mumbai, India. It`s


101
0:7:2,819 --> 0:7:7,65
in the shadows in Cambodia. It`s in the shadows
around the world in brothels and factories.


102
0:7:7,65 --> 0:7:12,309
These 60,000 students, they`re going to shine
a light on slavery.


103
0:7:12,309 --> 0:7:17,9
CLANCY: For many, this is a journey of the
Christian faith, one that brings them here


104
0:7:17,9 --> 0:7:21,979
to the Passion Conference to worship, pray
and learn. For the past two years, they`ve


105
0:7:21,979 --> 0:7:29,249
been focusing on the unholy scourge of sexual
slavery and forced labor, the 27 million victims,


106
0:7:29,249 --> 0:7:35,9
the billions of dollars churned out by robbing
men, women and children of their freedom.


107
0:7:35,9 --> 0:7:37,979
These young men and women are determined to
change that.


108
0:7:37,979 --> 0:7:41,189
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The truth is spoken here.
And where truth is spoken, things change.


109
0:7:41,189 --> 0:7:43,49
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`re going to raise the
awareness. We`re going to fight for those


110
0:7:43,49 --> 0:7:47,52
that ho -- don`t have a voice. And we`re just
going to tell people about this. And we`re


111
0:7:47,52 --> 0:7:49,909
going to let this world know that there`s
an issue and we`re not OK with it.


112
0:7:49,909 --> 0:7:52,789
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To just know that this
is out there and like it - - it just opened


113
0:7:52,789 --> 0:7:57,529
my eyes to all this. Like I had no idea this
was really going on. And then like I just


114
0:7:57,529 --> 0:7:59,11
want to be able to help as much as I can.


115
0:7:59,11 --> 0:8:4,29
VOGELTANZ: This is about students starting
a journey of justice, that their entire lives


116
0:8:4,29 --> 0:8:8,669
would count for justice, their entire lives
would count for freedom. And that`s happening


117
0:8:8,669 --> 0:8:8,879
here.


118
0:8:8,879 --> 0:8:15,439
CLANCY: Last year, the event raised $3.5 million.
With 20,000 more participants this year, tablet


119
0:8:15,439 --> 0:8:19,159
computers were used to help speed the donation
process.


120
0:8:19,159 --> 0:8:23,649
Some of the money comes from the students
themselves. More was raised in their communities.


121
0:8:23,649 --> 0:8:30,149
It will be used to help raise awareness, rescue
victims and help them restore their lives.


122
0:8:30,149 --> 0:8:31,74
(END VIDEO TAPE)


123
0:8:31,74 --> 0:8:36,349
AZUZ: Describe the civil rights leader and
Nobel Peace Prize winner in just one word.


124
0:8:36,349 --> 0:8:39,789
It`s a challenge, but we know you`re up for
it. Martin Luther King Day is coming up soon.


125
0:8:39,789 --> 0:8:44,66
We want you to send in iReports describing
Dr. King in just one word. The deadline is


126
0:8:44,66 --> 0:8:50,56
January 15th, so you`ve got one week to do
it and one place to find all the detail, CNNStudentNews.com.


127
0:8:50,56 --> 0:8:55,24
All right, we`re going to wrap things up today
in the skies over the California coast. It`s


128
0:8:55,24 --> 0:8:57,39
a bird, it`s a plane, it`s Super Man?


129
0:8:57,39 --> 0:9:3,2
It certainly looks like the comic book character.
It turns out this souped up soups is a remote-controlled


130
0:9:3,2 --> 0:9:6,9
flier. And this YouTube video has made him
an online sensation.


131
0:9:6,9 --> 0:9:12,3
Not exactly the man of steel. He`s more like
the man of lightweight foam. Of course, this


132
0:9:12,3 --> 0:9:16,12
cape-fur happened in Cal-Al-Fornia. We just
wish that it happened in a city named Clark,


133
0:9:16,12 --> 0:9:19,88
but I guess you Kent get everything you want.
These puns are just super bad.


134
0:9:19,88 --> 0:9:22,43
We`re going to go before we get carried up,
up and away.


135
0:9:22,43 --> 0:9:25,31
One real quick thing. We have a new blog up
on our home page.


136
0:9:25,31 --> 0:9:28,49
One week into the new year, how are your resolutions
holding up?


137
0:9:28,49 --> 0:9:29,85
Tell us at CNNStudentNews.com.


138
0:9:29,85 --> 0:11:29,85
And we`ll see you right back here again tomorrow.
