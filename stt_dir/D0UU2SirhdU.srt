Hi. Hi !


5
0:0:20,2 --> 0:0:23,0
- Yeah. No, I just... I'm just...
- Uhhh !


6
0:0:23,0 --> 0:0:27,0
..you know, just hanging out... Stop it !


7
0:0:27,0 --> 0:0:29,4
Er, no. Nobody, nobody.


8
0:0:29,4 --> 0:0:31,8
Erm, yeah.


9
0:0:31,8 --> 0:0:33,2
Today ? All right, yeah. OK.


10
0:0:33,2 --> 0:0:40,8
Well, I'll, er... I'll see you later, then. Bye.


11
0:0:40,8 --> 0:0:43,24
That was Sarah. She wants to see me today.


12
0:0:43,24 --> 0:0:45,4
- I wonder what that's all about.
- I dunno.


13
0:0:45,4 --> 0:0:48,28
Maybe she wants her CD player back.


14
0:0:48,28 --> 0:0:50,96
- Oooh !
- Maybe she's getting married.


15
0:0:50,96 --> 0:0:53,0
Ooh !


16
0:0:53,0 --> 0:1:5,72
- Maybe she's pregnant.
- Aaaarghhhh !...


17
0:1:5,72 --> 0:1:8,44
- So what's the attraction of this, then ?
- What ?


18
0:1:8,44 --> 0:1:10,52
- Skateboarding.
- What do you mean ?


19
0:1:10,52 --> 0:1:12,64
- Why do you do it ?
- It's quicker than walking.


20
0:1:12,64 --> 0:1:16,56
- Is it easy ?
- Daisy ! I'm kinda busy at the moment.


21
0:1:16,56 --> 0:1:20,24

- I was just asking.

0:1:24,76 --> 0:1:26,4
has just phoned up and asked to see me.


25
0:1:26,4 --> 0:1:29,92
You've picked a weird time to take
a spontaneous interest in my travel habits.


26
0:1:29,92 --> 0:1:32,12
- Thanks !
- All right, don't get upset.


27
0:1:32,12 --> 0:1:34,92
You hate skateboarding, anyway.
You're always saying it's childish,


28
0:1:34,92 --> 0:1:40,8
which really pisses me off because it's not.


29
0:1:40,8 --> 0:1:44,72
- All right, calm down.
- I am calm !


30
0:1:44,72 --> 0:1:48,2
I thought you were gonna take me to the ICA
to see Akira.


31
0:1:48,2 --> 0:1:50,76
Yeah, well, you know,...
we'll watch it on video.


32
0:1:50,76 --> 0:1:54,16
What was all that stuff you were saying about
"You've gotta see it on the big screen" ?


33
0:1:54,16 --> 0:1:58,32
Well, we'll just... sit close to the telly.


34
0:1:58,32 --> 0:2:2,2
All right, well,... take care of yourself.


35
0:2:2,2 --> 0:2:12,48
- Thank you.

- Hi.
- Shall we go in ?

He's going out to meet her !

So ? I see all of my ex-boyfriends.

0:2:53,64 --> 0:2:55,76
I see my ex-girlfriends.

Well, not so much see as... watch.


47
0:2:59,24 --> 0:3:2,84
- They might get back together.
- That's what she wants him to think.


48
0:3:2,84 --> 0:3:6,76
She's gonna look really good,
to remind him of how much he likes her,


49
0:3:6,76 --> 0:3:10,8
and say things like
"I'm just... I'm really confused."


50
0:3:10,8 --> 0:3:12,72

51
0:3:12,72 --> 0:3:20,24
and knowingly tortures someone
just to satisfy her own vanity ?

- Going to an exhibition later.

- Sounds riveting.
- Is he the one who does the white paintings ?


55
0:3:30,72 --> 0:3:32,24
Yeah.


56
0:3:32,24 --> 0:3:36,68
And he wears cheesecloth shirts ?
I know who you mean.


57
0:3:36,68 --> 0:3:38,92
D'you wanna come ?


58
0:3:38,92 --> 0:3:43,76
The thing is, I can't really walk in these heels.
They're more for sitting down than moving.


59
0:3:43,76 --> 0:3:45,6
Oh, OK.


60

62
0:3:51,64 --> 0:3:54,52
Bye.


63

- Did Brian just ask you out ?
- No.


64
0:3:58,36 --> 0:4:0,36
- Yes, he did.
- No, he didn't.


65
0:4:0,36 --> 0:4:2,4
- Yes, he did.
- Don't be silly.

- Pretty good.


73

- Pretty good ?
- Yeah, she's split up with Duane.


74
0:4:59,68 --> 0:5:2,2
- Right.
- She said she felt a little bit confused,


75
0:5:2,2 --> 0:5:5,52
but basically... I think she wants me back.


76
0:5:5,52 --> 0:5:8,24
We're gonna meet at the Bell later on,
talk at length.


77
0:5:8,24 --> 0:5:12,28
- Right.
- Yes, and I've got a funny feeling


78
0:5:12,28 --> 0:5:17,64
she's gonna want me
to move back in with her.


79
0:5:17,64 --> 0:5:20,76
- What was that ?
- It was our new doorbell.


80
0:5:20,76 --> 0:5:23,2
I bought it back from the shop.
It was gonna be a surprise.

- Good.</i>

What do you mean,
you've got a funny feeling ?


83

I just know, you know.
I can read her like a book.

- Shit.

How do you know she's not gonna
change her mind and dump you again ?


88
0:5:43,52 --> 0:5:47,68
- That's the doorbell again.
- Go on, then.


89
0:5:47,68 --> 0:5:57,2
All right !


90
0:5:57,2 --> 0:5:59,88
It's Mike. Gotta take him for his re-evaluation.


91
0:5:59,88 --> 0:6:3,16
- Hello, Daisy.
- Tim, I think we should talk about this.


92
0:6:3,16 --> 0:6:6,56
Did I ever tell you how Mike and myself
became such good friends ?


93
0:6:6,56 --> 0:6:10,28
It's quite an interesting story.
It happened when we were children,


94
0:6:10,28 --> 0:6:15,96
a long, long time ago.


95
0:6:15,96 --> 0:6:17,64

96

What ? !


98
0:6:21,52 --> 0:6:24,12
- What ?
- I can't believe you wanna move out.


99
0:6:24,12 --> 0:6:26,32
I don't want to...


100
0:6:26,32 --> 0:6:30,4
I don't want to move out from you,
I just want to move in with her.


101
0:6:30,4 --> 0:6:32,6
- I don't understand.
- What is your problem ?


102
0:6:32,6 --> 0:6:35,8
- I thought you'd be happy for me.
- Oh, I am. Yes, I am.


103
0:6:35,8 --> 0:6:38,52
It's what I want, Daisy.
You must have things you want.


104
0:6:38,52 --> 0:6:42,28
You always go on about wanting to go to Asia
and see the Taj Mahal. I don't complain.


105
0:6:42,28 --> 0:6:45,48
Yeah, I wanna go to Asia,
I wanna see the Taj Mahal.


106
0:6:45,48 --> 0:6:51,52
But the Taj Mahal didn't sleep with its boss
behind my back and break my heart !


107
0:6:51,52 --> 0:6:56,32
Yeah, well, it might if you go to Asia.


108
0:6:56,32 --> 0:6:58,76
What's her problem ?


109
0:6:58,76 --> 0:7:2,64
Maybe she's worried about you
stumbling blindly into a doomed relationship,


110
0:7:2,64 --> 0:7:3,88
getting badly hurt again,


111
0:7:3,88 --> 0:7:8,72
while losing this place and the friendship
you've built up over the past six months.


112
0:7:8,72 --> 0:7:14,4
It must mean a lot to her or she wouldn't be
so bothered about your emotional wellbeing.


113
0:7:14,4 --> 0:7:16,56
Get in the car, you big ape.


114
0:7:16,56 --> 0:7:20,96
OK, then.


115
0:7:20,96 --> 0:7:25,44
Just be yourself, OK ? Don't do anything odd.
It's really important for me that you get this.


116

- It isn't your fault, Tim.
- It is, Mike.


117
0:7:27,48 --> 0:7:28,8
- Isn't.
- Is.


118
0:7:28,8 --> 0:7:28,92
- Isn't.
- Is.


119
0:7:28,92 --> 0:7:29,48
- Isn't.
- Is.


120
0:7:29,48 --> 0:7:30,64
- Is.
- Isn't...


121
0:7:30,64 --> 0:7:33,8
- Ooh, why, you...
- Ahh !


122
0:7:33,8 --> 0:7:37,8
It is my fault, Mike.
I know we were only little, but...


123
0:7:37,8 --> 0:7:51,4
I can still see you up that tree.


124
0:7:51,4 --> 0:7:53,52
Come on !


125
0:7:53,52 --> 0:8:4,0
Come on !


126
0:8:4,0 --> 0:8:7,44
If you hadn't jumped, your retinas'd still
be attached - you'd be in the regular army.


127
0:8:7,44 --> 0:8:10,68
- You don't know that, Tim.
- Just...


128
0:8:10,68 --> 0:8:13,88
- Give it your best shot, OK ?
- Can't you come in with me ?


129
0:8:13,88 --> 0:8:17,6
I'm not your dad, Mike.


130
0:8:17,6 --> 0:8:21,28

Mr Watt, we're here to ascertain whether
you're ready to rejoin the Territorial Army.


134
0:8:38,88 --> 0:8:39,68
Yes.


135
0:8:39,68 --> 0:8:45,0
It's important to establish that you understand
the reasons for your original suspension.


136
0:8:45,0 --> 0:8:47,52
- I do, sir.
- Go on.


137
0:8:47,52 --> 0:8:50,4
In 1994, while on weekend manoeuvres
in France,


138
0:8:50,4 --> 0:8:54,68
I commandeered a Chieftain tank without
the permission of my immediate superiors.


139
0:8:54,68 --> 0:8:57,12
I then attempted to invade Paris.


140
0:8:57,12 --> 0:9:1,48
However, en route I stopped at Disneyland,
or Eurodisney as it was then called,


141
0:9:1,48 --> 0:9:4,36
and was subsequently apprehended
on Space Mountain.


142
0:9:4,36 --> 0:9:7,6
Do you have any explanation
as to why you might have done this ?


143
0:9:7,6 --> 0:9:13,16
At the time, I was suffering serious emotional
problems that clearly affected my judgment.


144
0:9:13,16 --> 0:9:16,12
I had immersed myself in a fantasy world
of my own creation


145
0:9:16,12 --> 0:9:19,2
and as a result I became very insular
and uncommunicative.


146
0:9:19,2 --> 0:9:22,84
Why do you think that was ?


147
0:9:22,84 --> 0:9:28,6
I dunno.


148
0:9:28,6 --> 0:9:31,72
Thanks for the shoes, Daise.


149
0:9:31,72 --> 0:9:36,0
Ahh, are you sure
you don't want to come, mm ?


150
0:9:36,0 --> 0:9:39,16
No, better not, I've got loads of work to do.


151
0:9:39,16 --> 0:9:57,24
Well, maybe I could...


152
0:9:57,24 --> 0:9:59,6
Kick. Kick. Kick !


153
0:9:59,6 --> 0:10:11,52
Kick ! Kick !


154
0:10:11,52 --> 0:10:13,92
- I'm going to pick up Mike from the TA.
- Yeah, all right.


155
0:10:13,92 --> 0:10:15,92
What time are you meeting Sarah ?


156
0:10:15,92 --> 0:10:18,0
Will you get off my back ? !


157
0:10:18,0 --> 0:10:20,6
- I'm not on your back.
- You are !


158
0:10:20,6 --> 0:10:24,76
Yeah... I can feel you, you're there,
like Jabba's little mate - "Wa-ha-ha !"


159
0:10:24,76 --> 0:10:27,12
Why can't you just wish me luck
and say "Have a good time" ?


160
0:10:27,12 --> 0:10:30,28
I'm not a hypocrite, I wouldn't wish you luck
with something I think is bad for you.


161
0:10:30,28 --> 0:10:32,6
- Well, can't you pretend ?
- No.


162
0:10:32,6 --> 0:10:34,88
- You just don't want me to move out, do you ?
- What ?


163
0:10:34,88 --> 0:10:37,16
- You don't want me to move out.
- Is that what you think this is about ?


164
0:10:37,16 --> 0:10:39,92
- Well...
- You conceited little shit !


165
0:10:39,92 --> 0:10:44,56
Don't you dare flatter yourself to think that
I would stand in your way for my own ends.


166
0:10:44,56 --> 0:10:47,48
For your information,
I would be sad if you moved out,


167
0:10:47,48 --> 0:10:49,48
but it isn't about me.


168
0:10:49,48 --> 0:10:52,96
I'm your friend, and friends
are supposed to look out for each other,


169
0:10:52,96 --> 0:10:54,6
and I think you're making a mistake.


170
0:10:54,6 --> 0:11:1,44
If you're too stupid to see that, then someone,
a friend, me, should point it out to you.


171
0:11:1,44 --> 0:11:5,92
<i>Well, OK, while we're being friends,
maybe I should be a friend to you</i>


172
0:11:5,92 --> 0:11:7,76
and point out that
you're using my personal problems


173
0:11:7,76 --> 0:11:12,68
as another in a long line of excuses not to get
out your bloody typewriter and do some work !


174
0:11:12,68 --> 0:11:15,56
<i>I am not avoiding work.</i>


175
0:11:15,56 --> 0:11:18,52
Oh, right, OK... "Ooh, let's have a party."


176
0:11:18,52 --> 0:11:20,8
"Ooh, let's do some theatre."


177
0:11:20,8 --> 0:11:21,24
"Ooh, let's get a dog."


178
0:11:21,24 --> 0:11:25,24
"Ooh, let's spend hours in front of
our bedroom mirror bogling to Aswad !"


179
0:11:25,24 --> 0:11:28,44
- That was research !
- You keep telling yourself that, Daisy,


180
0:11:28,44 --> 0:11:32,8
but I think I am big enough and ugly enough
to make my own mistakes !


181
0:11:32,8 --> 0:11:38,52
Well, Sarah obviously does.

0:11:38,52 --> 0:11:40,56

183
0:11:40,56 --> 0:11:43,56

<i>Daisy Steiner wins !</i>


185
0:11:45,96 --> 0:12:5,32
<i>Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha-ha ha-ha !</i>


186
0:12:5,32 --> 0:12:8,6
- Oh, hi, Marsha.
- Hello. Are you busy ?


187
0:12:8,6 --> 0:12:11,44
Erm, well, yes, I'm...


188
0:12:11,44 --> 0:12:13,16
working.


189
0:12:13,16 --> 0:12:18,56
But I could do with a breather.


190
0:12:18,56 --> 0:12:22,88
Listen,... I couldn't help
overhearing you and Tim rowing.


191
0:12:22,88 --> 0:12:25,24
- Really ?
- Oh, it's all right.


192
0:12:25,24 --> 0:12:27,8
It was ever so loud.


193
0:12:27,8 --> 0:12:30,8
- ..bogling to Aswad !
- That was research !


194
0:12:30,8 --> 0:12:31,6
Sorry.


195
0:12:31,6 --> 0:12:37,24
That's all right. Do you want
a splash of vino collapso ?


196
0:12:37,24 --> 0:12:41,76
Once again, the fruit of my loins has fucked
off to Top Shop with the housekeeping.


197
0:12:41,76 --> 0:12:44,56
Well, I'll just have the one.


198
0:12:44,56 --> 0:12:49,4
I just saw that friend of yours, Twit,
leaving with Brian.


199
0:12:49,4 --> 0:12:53,0
- What's that all about, then ?
- They're just going to an exhibition together.


200
0:12:53,0 --> 0:12:54,68
Is it serious ?


201
0:12:54,68 --> 0:12:56,76
Tunde Aragundade.


202
0:12:56,76 --> 0:12:59,48
Bloody hell.


203
0:12:59,48 --> 0:13:2,68
Oh, well. C'est la vie.


204
0:13:2,68 --> 0:13:6,68
Et tu, Brian ?


205
0:13:6,68 --> 0:13:10,44
What is going on between you and Brian ?


206
0:13:10,44 --> 0:13:12,84
- This one ?
- War.


207
0:13:12,84 --> 0:13:15,84
- This one ?
- Bombs ?


208
0:13:15,84 --> 0:13:19,16
- This one ?
- Guts.


209
0:13:19,16 --> 0:13:22,56
Guns.


210
0:13:22,56 --> 0:13:26,36
Guts and guns.


211
0:13:26,36 --> 0:13:29,2
Butterfly.


212
0:13:29,2 --> 0:13:32,56
Butterfly with a bomb.


213
0:13:32,56 --> 0:13:37,6
Finally, Mr Watt,
how does this make you feel ?


214
0:13:37,6 --> 0:13:39,64
Nice.


215
0:13:39,64 --> 0:13:56,12
Welcome back, Mike.


216
0:13:56,12 --> 0:13:59,8
You and Brian ?


217
0:13:59,8 --> 0:14:2,12
Yeah.


218
0:14:2,12 --> 0:14:4,12
Well...


219
0:14:4,12 --> 0:14:11,8
one night he came up here, begging me
to let him stay cos he couldn't pay his rent.


220
0:14:11,8 --> 0:14:15,44
We had a couple of bottles
of duty-free grappa.


221
0:14:15,44 --> 0:14:18,24
Next thing I know,...


222
0:14:18,24 --> 0:14:20,68
I'm riding him like a bitch from hell.


223
0:14:20,68 --> 0:14:23,8
You became lovers ?


224
0:14:23,8 --> 0:14:29,96
No, it was his rent, really.


225
0:14:29,96 --> 0:14:35,48
Did he leave a deposit ?


226
0:14:35,48 --> 0:14:37,68
To tell you the truth,


227
0:14:37,68 --> 0:14:42,4
I'm not sure how interested he is in women.


228
0:14:42,4 --> 0:14:45,56
Nice Arse.


229
0:14:45,56 --> 0:14:51,12
1957.


230
0:14:51,12 --> 0:14:53,16
The Fifth Elephant.


231
0:14:53,16 --> 0:14:55,8
Mm.


232
0:14:55,8 --> 0:14:58,24
I mean, look at them, they're all so...


233
0:14:58,24 --> 0:15:0,8
They're really...


234
0:15:0,8 --> 0:15:1,92
Samey.


235
0:15:1,92 --> 0:15:3,88
Yeah.


236
0:15:3,88 --> 0:15:11,8
Exactly.


237
0:15:11,8 --> 0:15:14,88
So, what have you and Tim
been rowing about ?


238
0:15:14,88 --> 0:15:18,24
- He says he wants to move out.
- Oh, dear.


239
0:15:18,24 --> 0:15:20,84
Trouble in paradise.


240
0:15:20,84 --> 0:15:23,48
He says I was avoiding work.


241
0:15:23,48 --> 0:15:26,6
- Well, are you ?
- No !


242
0:15:26,6 --> 0:15:28,44
Yes.


243
0:15:28,44 --> 0:15:30,92
Aah, don't worry, he'll come back.


244
0:15:30,92 --> 0:15:35,68
- If he doesn't, are you gonna chuck me out ?
- No !


245
0:15:35,68 --> 0:15:37,96
I like having you here.


246
0:15:37,96 --> 0:15:41,68
<i>I feel like you've always lived here.</i>


247
0:15:41,68 --> 0:15:43,96
I hope you never leave.


248
0:15:43,96 --> 0:15:49,92
<i>Never leave,,, Never leave,,,
Never leave,,, Never leave,,,</i>


249
0:15:49,92 --> 0:15:57,76
(Aswad: Don't Turn Around)


250
0:15:57,76 --> 0:16:1,36
Sorry, Marsha, I think...
I've got to get on with some work.


251
0:16:1,36 --> 0:16:3,4
Oh, it's all right, kitten.


252
0:16:3,4 --> 0:16:7,28
I'm gonna go and have a lie down, I'm pissed.


253
0:16:7,28 --> 0:16:8,88
Listen,...


254
0:16:8,88 --> 0:16:12,4
you can tell your friend Twit
she can have Brian.


255
0:16:12,4 --> 0:16:17,4
His housing benefit's come through, anyway.


256
0:16:17,4 --> 0:16:21,32
- Good night.
- Night.


257
0:16:21,32 --> 0:16:31,72
Right. You're coming with me.


258
0:16:31,72 --> 0:17:1,28
(Theme from Murder, She Wrote)


259
0:17:1,28 --> 0:17:4,4
This was really inspiring, thank you, Brian.


260
0:17:4,4 --> 0:17:6,24
- I got you a postcard.
- Thanks.


261
0:17:6,24 --> 0:17:9,64
Oh, my favourite !


262
0:17:9,64 --> 0:17:12,6
Well,... I suppose... I'll see you.


263
0:17:12,6 --> 0:17:16,8
Exhibition on next week. Sounds good.


264
0:17:16,8 --> 0:17:19,8
- Really ?
- It's Roman Duchamp's insect faecal matter.


265
0:17:19,8 --> 0:17:22,12
Faecal ? Lovely.


266
0:17:22,12 --> 0:17:24,24
I was thinking...


267
0:17:24,24 --> 0:17:27,4
afterwards, if you, er...


268
0:17:27,4 --> 0:17:29,96
er, want to go for a drink ?


269
0:17:29,96 --> 0:17:57,92
Yep, OK.


270
0:17:57,92 --> 0:18:0,32
<i>I've held you in my arms a thousand times</i>


271
0:18:0,32 --> 0:18:3,56
<i>Closed my eyes
and known we would always be together</i>


272
0:18:3,56 --> 0:18:5,68
<i>I smiled at you through all your many lies</i>


273
0:18:5,68 --> 0:18:8,76
<i>Unknowing and unthinking
that eternity would be never</i>


274
0:18:8,76 --> 0:18:12,0
<i>As distance dulls the memory
and bitter history grows hazy</i>


275
0:18:12,0 --> 0:18:16,84
<i>I realise my one true love
is in fact a girl called,,,</i>


276
0:18:16,84 --> 0:18:22,36
- Hi.
- Hi ! Hi, hi.


277
0:18:22,36 --> 0:18:25,36
- Your hair looks nice.
- Thanks.


278
0:18:25,36 --> 0:18:27,8
I see you're still murdering yours
with peroxide.


279
0:18:27,8 --> 0:18:35,28
Ah ! Don't know what you mean.


280
0:18:35,28 --> 0:18:37,72
I guess we've got a lot to talk about.


281
0:18:37,72 --> 0:18:45,64
Yeah, yeah. I guess we have.


282
0:18:45,64 --> 0:18:49,6
Paper... paper... I need more paper.


283
0:18:49,6 --> 0:19:34,56
Paper.


284
0:19:34,56 --> 0:19:40,72
Ah !


285
0:19:40,72 --> 0:19:43,36
- Hello ?
- Hi, Daisy, it's me.


286
0:19:43,36 --> 0:19:45,4
Oh, Tim. Where are you ?


287
0:19:45,4 --> 0:19:49,56
I'm in the pub. Look, do you fancy a drink ?


288
0:19:49,56 --> 0:19:52,44
Erm,... not really.


289
0:19:52,44 --> 0:19:54,16
'Oh.'


290
0:19:54,16 --> 0:19:56,2
Is Sarah still there ?


291
0:19:56,2 --> 0:20:0,44
- No, she's gone.
- Oh, I see. Right.


292
0:20:0,44 --> 0:20:17,28
All right. Well, you get them in and I'll see you
in a few minutes. All right, mate ?


293
0:20:17,28 --> 0:20:20,2
- Hiya.
- Ah ! Well...


294
0:20:20,2 --> 0:20:23,0
I've been writing.


295
0:20:23,0 --> 0:20:25,4
- Have you ?
- Yep.


296
0:20:25,4 --> 0:20:29,64
After you left, I just sat down in front of
my typewriter and it just poured out.


297
0:20:29,64 --> 0:20:31,64
- Really ?
- Yeah.


298
0:20:31,64 --> 0:20:33,88
"Winter skin care: dos and don'ts",


299
0:20:33,88 --> 0:20:36,52
er, "Sex and food:
the modern woman's addiction",


300
0:20:36,52 --> 0:20:38,56
and "Bogling - is it the new tango ?".


301
0:20:38,56 --> 0:20:41,4
Wow ! So it was research ?


302
0:20:41,4 --> 0:20:42,88
Yeah.


303
0:20:42,88 --> 0:20:53,4
<i>So, I'm thinking Bella for the first two,
Observer for the bogling.</i>


304
0:20:53,4 --> 0:20:55,72
It's probably for the best.


305
0:20:55,72 --> 0:20:59,44
Yeah, I know and before you say anything,
it was my decision.


306
0:20:59,44 --> 0:21:1,52
- Really ?
- Yeah.


307
0:21:1,52 --> 0:21:3,96
She wanted me back but I said no.


308
0:21:3,96 --> 0:21:6,8
Wow.


309
0:21:6,8 --> 0:21:10,96
l-I just had a moment of clarity, you know.
I woke up.


310
0:21:10,96 --> 0:21:14,32
It's like... you know
when you have an orgasm on your own ?


311
0:21:14,32 --> 0:21:17,0
You know, you're sort of lying on the sofa


312
0:21:17,0 --> 0:21:20,52
watching some porn movie you bought
on a drunken, Ionely night in Soho,


313
0:21:20,52 --> 0:21:23,4
and everything is really great.


314
0:21:23,4 --> 0:21:26,8
You're getting totally turned on
by these absurdly graphic images,


315
0:21:26,8 --> 0:21:30,96
everything seems so right,
and suddenly... bingo ! You wake up.


316
0:21:30,96 --> 0:21:33,16
And you're lying there sweating,


317
0:21:33,16 --> 0:21:36,16
desperately looking for the tissue
which you know is still in your pocket


318
0:21:36,16 --> 0:21:38,2
and the remote control
which is somewhere on the floor,


319
0:21:38,2 --> 0:21:41,36
and it's like walking in on yourself, you know.


320
0:21:41,36 --> 0:21:45,24
It's just like "What you doing ?"


321
0:21:45,24 --> 0:21:49,28
That's how I felt tonight, feeling my heart
miss a beat every time the door opened.


322
0:21:49,28 --> 0:21:54,24
"What the fuck are you doing ?"


323
0:21:54,24 --> 0:22:2,44
Well, that's love, isn't it ? A load of old wank.


324
0:22:2,44 --> 0:22:7,24
Life just isn't like the movies, is it ?
You know ?


325
0:22:7,24 --> 0:22:12,88
We're constantly led to believe in resolution,
in the re-establishment of the ideal status quo


326
0:22:12,88 --> 0:22:15,88
and it's just not true.


327
0:22:15,88 --> 0:22:17,96
Happy endings are a myth


328
0:22:17,96 --> 0:22:29,92
designed to make us feel better
about the fact that life is a thankless struggle.


329
0:22:29,92 --> 0:22:32,96
Do you want to dance ?


330
0:22:32,96 --> 0:22:41,84
Do you know what ? I think I do.


331
0:22:41,84 --> 0:22:45,96
Now, I got a woman who's always late


332
0:22:45,96 --> 0:22:48,8
Every time we make a date


333
0:22:48,8 --> 0:22:51,64
But I love her


334
0:22:51,64 --> 0:22:55,36
And I want her


335
0:22:55,36 --> 0:22:58,56
Gonna walk up to her gate


336
0:22:58,56 --> 0:23:1,0
See if I can get it straight


337
0:23:1,0 --> 0:23:3,8
Cos I love her


338
0:23:3,8 --> 0:23:7,72
I'm gonna ask her


339
0:23:7,72 --> 0:23:14,12
Is you is, or is you ain't my baby ?


340
0:23:14,12 --> 0:23:18,32
The way you're acting lately
makes me doubt


341
0:23:18,32 --> 0:23:20,4
Yes, it does


342
0:23:20,4 --> 0:23:26,8
You is still my baby, baby


343
0:23:26,8 --> 0:23:41,44
It seems my flame in your heart's
done gone out


344
0:23:41,44 --> 0:23:43,88
Do you really watch porn in the flat ?


345
0:23:43,88 --> 0:23:48,8
Er, only when you're out.


346
0:23:48,8 --> 0:23:56,4
Sometimes when you're asleep
on the beanbag.


347
0:23:56,4 --> 0:24:0,32
- Can I borrow some ?
- Er, yeah.


348
0:24:0,32 --> 0:24:1,44
Thanks.


349
0:24:1,44 --> 0:24:4,16
When you find the one you love


350
0:24:4,16 --> 0:24:7,48
She's gone and made a change


351
0:24:7,48 --> 0:24:13,8
But is you is, or is you ain't my baby ?


352
0:24:13,8 --> 0:24:19,8
Maybe baby's found somebody new


353
0:24:19,8 --> 0:24:23,8
Or is my baby


354
0:24:23,8 --> 0:24:29,24
Still my baby true  ?
