0:0:1,67 --> 0:0:2,3
Hi, I'm Sharon Long,


2
0:0:2,3 --> 0:0:3,633
from Stanford University,


3
0:0:3,633 --> 0:0:7,1
and I'm here to give my lecture on nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.


4
0:0:7,1 --> 0:0:10,233
Today, I'll be talking about the regulation of the genes in the


5
0:0:10,233 --> 0:0:13,767
bacterium itself and how those genes are controlled.


6
0:0:13,767 --> 0:0:17,833
So just as a review, nitrogen fixation happens in root nodules.


7
0:0:17,833 --> 0:0:20,4
These nodules form as a result of action of


8
0:0:20,4 --> 0:0:23,133
soil bacteria interacting with a specific plant.


9
0:0:23,133 --> 0:0:27,5
Here, you see nodules growing on the root system of a soybean.


10
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:32,67
This is a complicated series of tissue and cell interactions,


11
0:0:32,67 --> 0:0:33,933
a complex developmental process,


12
0:0:33,933 --> 0:0:37,933
and there's specificity between the bacteria and the plant.


13
0:0:37,933 --> 0:0:42,167
I'll talk about one side of that specificity a little later today.


14
0:0:42,167 --> 0:0:45,33
In the early stages for sure, and I'll make the case that it's


15
0:0:45,33 --> 0:0:49,733
in the later stages as well, bacteria and plant exchange


16
0:0:49,733 --> 0:0:54,333
signals in order to coordinate with each other.


17
0:0:54,333 --> 0:0:57,33
Now, let's take the standpoint of the bacterium.


18
0:0:57,33 --> 0:1:1,33
It's making this huge transition from the free-living bacteria,


19
0:1:1,33 --> 0:1:5,67
through invasion, in which the bacteria are able to form


20
0:1:5,67 --> 0:1:8,67
an infection thread and penetrate through individual cells,


21
0:1:8,67 --> 0:1:12,267
and then into multiple layers of the root, and finally,


22
0:1:12,267 --> 0:1:16,567
nitrogen fixation, where the bacteria have become endosymbionts,


23
0:1:16,567 --> 0:1:18,933
inside the cytoplasm of a plant cell,


24
0:1:18,933 --> 0:1:23,33
and they persist there in a differentiated form, almost like an organelle.


25
0:1:23,33 --> 0:1:26,8
All of these changes are accompanied by carefully regulated


26
0:1:26,8 --> 0:1:31,667
changes in gene expression.


27
0:1:31,667 --> 0:1:34,233
Here's an outline of what I'd like to tell you today.


28
0:1:34,233 --> 0:1:37,733
I'll begin by talking about a few tools that we use to study


29
0:1:37,733 --> 0:1:41,33
the genetics and the gene expression of the bacteria.


30
0:1:41,33 --> 0:1:46,333
And then I'd like to say something about the control of the nodulation genes.


31
0:1:46,333 --> 0:1:49,633
This is probably the most studied of any of the gene regulation


32
0:1:49,633 --> 0:1:53,333
events in symbiosis. I'll review some of the background,


33
0:1:53,333 --> 0:1:58,0
and then I'll talk primarily about the protein activator NodD.


34
0:1:58,0 --> 0:2:2,33
I'll then tell you some of our recent work on RNA polymerase


35
0:2:2,33 --> 0:2:4,633
and especially the sigma factors and how they may be


36
0:2:4,633 --> 0:2:10,2
playing a role in changing and guiding gene expression during symbiosis.


37
0:2:10,2 --> 0:2:14,0
I'll finish with several glimpses of how particular sets of


38
0:2:14,0 --> 0:2:19,8
genes are controlled, and a preview of all of the factors


39
0:2:19,8 --> 0:2:27,233
yet to find in terms of how many genes are active in nodulation.


40
0:2:27,233 --> 0:2:33,6
So, the first tool to remind you about is my favorite, and that's genetics.


41
0:2:33,6 --> 0:2:37,333
We can take bacteria and, through mutagenesis and then


42
0:2:37,333 --> 0:2:40,6
blind screens, we can ask what are the most


43
0:2:40,6 --> 0:2:42,967
important genes for symbiosis.


44
0:2:42,967 --> 0:2:45,267
Now, there's a couple of different symbiotic phenotypes


45
0:2:45,267 --> 0:2:49,5
that we have observed. In contrast to a wild-type situation,


46
0:2:49,5 --> 0:2:52,567
where the bacteria growing in the free-living state are able to


47
0:2:52,567 --> 0:2:56,367
interact with the correct host plant and make functional nodules,


48
0:2:56,367 --> 0:2:59,567
shown here by having a red color reflecting the


49
0:2:59,567 --> 0:3:2,3
leghemoglobin that's inside the plant.


50
0:3:2,3 --> 0:3:6,467
The nodules harbor bacteria that fix nitrogen, the plants are able to


51
0:3:6,467 --> 0:3:9,333
use that to make chlorophyll and protein, they flourish,


52
0:3:9,333 --> 0:3:10,733
and they're nice and green.


53
0:3:10,733 --> 0:3:14,467
But, if the bacteria have a mutation in a gene that's


54
0:3:14,467 --> 0:3:17,667
required for the formation of the nodule, the result


55
0:3:17,667 --> 0:3:19,9
will be that the plant forms no nodules.


56
0:3:19,9 --> 0:3:23,4
Therefore, it's not getting any fixed nitrogen, and it starves,


57
0:3:23,4 --> 0:3:26,633
it's yellow, and it doesn't grow very well.


58
0:3:26,633 --> 0:3:30,267
We would call this a nod gene in the bacterium


59
0:3:30,267 --> 0:3:34,267
because mutations in that gene result in the so-called


60
0:3:34,267 --> 0:3:37,5
Nod- (no nodule) phenotype.


61
0:3:37,5 --> 0:3:40,367
The other outcome, again comparing to the wild type,


62
0:3:40,367 --> 0:3:43,933
would be that a bacterium might be able to form a nodule,


63
0:3:43,933 --> 0:3:47,167
but those nodules don't function, and what I've shown here


64
0:3:47,167 --> 0:3:52,567
is I've symbolized that by these empty, white circles.


65
0:3:52,567 --> 0:3:55,2
Those show nodules which are not fixing nitrogen,


66
0:3:55,2 --> 0:3:58,633
they don't have leghemoglobin, and so we would call


67
0:3:58,633 --> 0:4:1,0
this Fix- phenotype,


68
0:4:1,0 --> 0:4:4,233
and the corresponding bacterial gene is going to be a fix gene.


69
0:4:4,233 --> 0:4:7,5
Another approach is to look at the genome.


70
0:4:7,5 --> 0:4:11,33
Bacteria tend to have genomes between about one million


71
0:4:11,33 --> 0:4:15,667
for the very smallest pathogens, all the way up to 10 million bases.


72
0:4:15,667 --> 0:4:20,433
Rhizobium is on the large size, over 6.5 million bases,


73
0:4:20,433 --> 0:4:25,567
divided into three replication units: a chromosome, 3.65 million;


74
0:4:25,567 --> 0:4:28,367
and two very large so-called megaplasmids.


75
0:4:28,367 --> 0:4:30,233
They're called megaplasmids because they're more than


76
0:4:30,233 --> 0:4:32,367
one million bases each.


77
0:4:32,367 --> 0:4:37,6
pSymB, 1.68 million, and pSymA, 1.35 million.


78
0:4:37,6 --> 0:4:42,233
The nodulation and nitrogen-fixation genes are located on pSymA,


79
0:4:42,233 --> 0:4:46,33
but in addition, there are symbiosis genes on pSymB and


80
0:4:46,33 --> 0:4:48,133
on the chromosome. So to some extent,


81
0:4:48,133 --> 0:4:51,333
the symbiosis genes are dispersed.


82
0:4:51,333 --> 0:4:54,933
Now, we can take a genomic approach to look at transcription,


83
0:4:54,933 --> 0:4:57,0
and one way in which we have approached that


84
0:4:57,0 --> 0:5:1,2
is to do global assays of transcription


85
0:5:1,2 --> 0:5:4,0
using a custom-designed Affymetrix chip.


86
0:5:4,0 --> 0:5:7,233
On this chip, we place the genome of the bacterium


87
0:5:7,233 --> 0:5:12,33
together with 10,000-some genes from the plant


88
0:5:12,33 --> 0:5:16,867
as follows: The entire Sinorhizobium meliloti genome is there,


89
0:5:16,867 --> 0:5:23,0
every one of the 6000+ open reading frames and the intergenic spaces,


90
0:5:23,0 --> 0:5:27,367
and 10,000 tentative consensus sequences from cDNAs


91
0:5:27,367 --> 0:5:29,433
that were sequenced from the plant.


92
0:5:29,433 --> 0:5:31,8
Now you'll see some experiments later in which


93
0:5:31,8 --> 0:5:36,433
we're looking at the expression of genes in Sinorhizobium meliloti,


94
0:5:36,433 --> 0:5:39,667
and in one case, we're going to be simultaneously looking


95
0:5:39,667 --> 0:5:41,833
at both the bacterium and the plant.


96
0:5:41,833 --> 0:5:46,533
And we can do that from a single RNA prep, as shown here.


97
0:5:46,533 --> 0:5:49,4
So, if you grind up a nodule,


98
0:5:49,4 --> 0:5:52,2
so you're starting with a nodule over here...


99
0:5:52,2 --> 0:5:55,67
of course, this is going to be full of many plant cells,


100
0:5:55,67 --> 0:5:58,0
each one of those plant cells has bacteria,


101
0:5:58,0 --> 0:6:1,5
and those bacteria shown here have differentiated.


102
0:6:1,5 --> 0:6:5,733
So a nodule lysate is going to have a


103
0:6:5,733 --> 0:6:9,1
mixture of all of those materials.


104
0:6:9,1 --> 0:6:13,967
We have a method which allows us to capture both bacteria and plant


105
0:6:13,967 --> 0:6:16,9
DNAs at the same time, and that can be shown here.


106
0:6:16,9 --> 0:6:18,967
For reference, in the right-hand lane,


107
0:6:18,967 --> 0:6:22,267
we have isolated RNA from a plant root,


108
0:6:22,267 --> 0:6:29,267
that shows you the large and small ribosomal RNAs here, for reference.


109
0:6:29,267 --> 0:6:33,267
On the left-hand lane, we have bacteria grown in culture.


110
0:6:33,267 --> 0:6:36,67
You can see again, the bacterial RNAs here.


111
0:6:36,67 --> 0:6:41,267
Our prep for nodule RNAs captures both of those, as you can see.


112
0:6:41,267 --> 0:6:44,733
And this, by being labeled and hybridized onto our Affy Chip


113
0:6:44,733 --> 0:6:49,933
allows us to get a snapshot of both partners at the same time,


114
0:6:49,933 --> 0:6:53,533
which is very useful, especially when you're analyzing mutants,


115
0:6:53,533 --> 0:6:58,2
and useful because perfect synchrony of nodulation


116
0:6:58,2 --> 0:7:1,9
is hard to achieve experimentally.


117
0:7:1,9 --> 0:7:3,833
So, having introduced those tools,


118
0:7:3,833 --> 0:7:7,7
now I'd like to tell you about the control of the nodulation genes.


119
0:7:7,7 --> 0:7:10,267
Just a little bit of review:


120
0:7:10,267 --> 0:7:13,8
Nodulation genes here are the genes


121
0:7:13,8 --> 0:7:17,233
that encode enzymes that synthesize Nod Factor.


122
0:7:17,233 --> 0:7:22,667
I talked about Nod Factor, and I'll show you a cartoon in a moment.


123
0:7:22,667 --> 0:7:26,833
It is the substance created by the bacteria that's a


124
0:7:26,833 --> 0:7:30,867
molecular signal that causes the plant to form the nodule,


125
0:7:30,867 --> 0:7:35,5
and it also causes transcription in a number of other events in the plant.


126
0:7:35,5 --> 0:7:37,667
So, powerful signal molecule.


127
0:7:37,667 --> 0:7:42,667
The genes in the bacterium that are responsible for producing


128
0:7:42,667 --> 0:7:47,667
Nod Factor include the common nod genes, nodABC.


129
0:7:47,667 --> 0:7:51,7
The transcription of nodABC is controlled by a promoter


130
0:7:51,7 --> 0:7:56,767
that includes what's shown here in this oblong, the so-called nod box,


131
0:7:56,767 --> 0:8:0,933
a highly conserved motif that's in the DNA


132
0:8:0,933 --> 0:8:6,167
upstream of the nodulation genes, both this set of common nod genes,


133
0:8:6,167 --> 0:8:8,867
and others that are coordinately regulated.


134
0:8:8,867 --> 0:8:11,3
All of these genes, as I mentioned before,


135
0:8:11,3 --> 0:8:15,167
are located on pSymA.


136
0:8:15,167 --> 0:8:18,9
Now, this cartoon introduces a couple of themes.


137
0:8:18,9 --> 0:8:21,5
First, it reminds us, from my first lecture,


138
0:8:21,5 --> 0:8:25,8
that the early events of nodulation include a conversation


139
0:8:25,8 --> 0:8:28,367
between the plant and the bacteria.


140
0:8:28,367 --> 0:8:30,933
The plant sends a signal out to the bacteria,


141
0:8:30,933 --> 0:8:33,33
the bacteria send a signal back.


142
0:8:33,33 --> 0:8:37,33
In the case shown on the left, we're taking a look at alfalfa,


143
0:8:37,33 --> 0:8:39,3
Meticago sativa.


144
0:8:39,3 --> 0:8:43,167
This plant produces a molecule, coded in yellow here,


145
0:8:43,167 --> 0:8:45,33
and you'll see the structure in a moment.


146
0:8:45,33 --> 0:8:48,1
That signal, from the plant to the bacterium,


147
0:8:48,1 --> 0:8:52,6
is able to trigger gene expression, and we'll talk about that in detail.


148
0:8:52,6 --> 0:8:55,633
The result of that gene expression, as I mentioned before,


149
0:8:55,633 --> 0:9:0,33
is the production of a Nod Factor called NF-Sm.


150
0:9:0,33 --> 0:9:3,333
That's the Nod Factor from Sinorhizobium meliloti.


151
0:9:3,333 --> 0:9:9,67
It has a backbone of N-acetylglucosamines, which is modified,


152
0:9:9,67 --> 0:9:11,8
in the case of Sinorhizobium meliloti,


153
0:9:11,8 --> 0:9:15,67
with a 16-carbon N-acyl substitution here,


154
0:9:15,67 --> 0:9:19,6
an acetyl, and a sulfate, each shown by a color code.


155
0:9:19,6 --> 0:9:24,33
Now, on the right, we have the contrasting example of a cousin,


156
0:9:24,33 --> 0:9:27,533
a related legume, pea, or Pisum sativum.


157
0:9:27,533 --> 0:9:29,667
Here, we've got the root of the pea plant.


158
0:9:29,667 --> 0:9:33,167
It's creating a flavonoid signal whose structure is slightly different,


159
0:9:33,167 --> 0:9:35,133
and I've shown that just by the color coding.


160
0:9:35,133 --> 0:9:40,6
That signal triggers Rhizobium leguminosarum,


161
0:9:40,6 --> 0:9:45,1
which is the symbiont for pea, to transcribe its nodulation genes,


162
0:9:45,1 --> 0:9:47,967
and those encode enzymes that make a Nod Factor,


163
0:9:47,967 --> 0:9:50,67
but it's a slightly different Nod Factor.


164
0:9:50,67 --> 0:9:52,133
The primary difference, which I'm showing here,


165
0:9:52,133 --> 0:9:55,367
which is not the only difference, but for the sake of simplicity...


166
0:9:55,367 --> 0:9:59,233
A primary difference is the nature of the N-acyl substitution,


167
0:9:59,233 --> 0:10:3,567
it's eight carbons instead of 16, and it has four unsaturations.


168
0:10:3,567 --> 0:10:6,233
So what we see is some specificity.


169
0:10:6,233 --> 0:10:12,0
A signal that goes out from the plant from alfalfa here,


170
0:10:12,0 --> 0:10:14,233
or a slightly different one from pea,


171
0:10:14,233 --> 0:10:17,567
and the corresponding bacteria which respond to this signal


172
0:10:17,567 --> 0:10:20,9
make a slightly different Nod Factor, as shown here.


173
0:10:20,9 --> 0:10:24,9
So, this conversation, plant to bacteria and back again,


174
0:10:24,9 --> 0:10:28,5
already has some of the hallmarks of the host specificity.


175
0:10:28,5 --> 0:10:33,3
We're going to talk only about the first part of that conversation.


176
0:10:33,3 --> 0:10:38,367
Here I'm showing again the host plant producing a flavonoid signal,


177
0:10:38,367 --> 0:10:41,433
and that is causing transcription in the bacteria.


178
0:10:41,433 --> 0:10:46,167
Now, I'd like to focus in on the interaction of the flavonoid


179
0:10:46,167 --> 0:10:50,167
with a protein encoded by this gene, NodD.


180
0:10:50,167 --> 0:10:56,567
NodD is an activator protein, a part of the LysR family.


181
0:10:56,567 --> 0:11:1,567
Now, what are all the elements we're going to have to look at?


182
0:11:1,567 --> 0:11:5,667
Of course, at a promoter, there's going to be an RNA polymerase,


183
0:11:5,667 --> 0:11:9,3
there's going to be a DNA motif to interact with,


184
0:11:9,3 --> 0:11:12,233
in this case there's an activator, and we wonder,


185
0:11:12,233 --> 0:11:15,567
how do these plant signals interact with all of these


186
0:11:15,567 --> 0:11:18,933
components in order to achieve transcription?


187
0:11:18,933 --> 0:11:22,467
And how does this occur in a specific way?


188
0:11:22,467 --> 0:11:27,333
So, I'll take a look now first, and most specifically,


189
0:11:27,333 --> 0:11:31,133
at the protein NodD.


190
0:11:31,133 --> 0:11:35,0
I'll put that here in the context of all of those other components.


191
0:11:35,0 --> 0:11:39,767
The red here is showing DNA, all right, so here's the DNA,


192
0:11:39,767 --> 0:11:44,367
and the object of this regulation is going to be to


193
0:11:44,367 --> 0:11:47,367
achieve transcription of the nodulation genes,


194
0:11:47,367 --> 0:11:52,8
so that they can then make the proteins that synthesize Nod Factor.


195
0:11:52,8 --> 0:11:56,33
At the DNA, we have a promoter,


196
0:11:56,33 --> 0:11:58,4
and that's upstream of the nod boxes.


197
0:11:58,4 --> 0:12:3,267
We know that NodD binds to the promoter and bends the DNA.


198
0:12:3,267 --> 0:12:7,1
I've shown here a model of NodD as a tetramer;


199
0:12:7,1 --> 0:12:9,767
we don't know exactly what its form is,


200
0:12:9,767 --> 0:12:13,133
but we suspect that it's most likely to be a tetramer,


201
0:12:13,133 --> 0:12:15,767
and more work in the future, we hope,


202
0:12:15,767 --> 0:12:18,267
will elucidate that more precisely.


203
0:12:18,267 --> 0:12:21,7
We've shown through genetics that the ability of NodD


204
0:12:21,7 --> 0:12:24,867
to cause gene expression in bacteria in response


205
0:12:24,867 --> 0:12:29,633
to a plant signal requires the chaperonins GroES and GroEL.


206
0:12:29,633 --> 0:12:32,3
Also, we found through genetics that this entire system


207
0:12:32,3 --> 0:12:36,633
requires the "stringent response," that being a response,


208
0:12:36,633 --> 0:12:44,433
classically to starvation, where a protein, here RelA,


209
0:12:44,433 --> 0:12:48,3
causes the synthesis of guanosine tetra- or pentaphosphate,


210
0:12:48,3 --> 0:12:52,933
shown here as this star.


211
0:12:52,933 --> 0:12:56,667
All of that has to interact with RNA polymerase,


212
0:12:56,667 --> 0:12:58,9
the machine that's going to interact with DNA


213
0:12:58,9 --> 0:13:2,833
and cause template-driven transcription of an mRNA


214
0:13:2,833 --> 0:13:5,4
off of the DNA template.


215
0:13:5,4 --> 0:13:8,167
So, these are some of the things that we know,


216
0:13:8,167 --> 0:13:11,0
but there's a lot of unknowns.


217
0:13:11,0 --> 0:13:18,6
Let's ask, for example, how the inducer works with the NodD.


218
0:13:18,6 --> 0:13:22,333
Now I'm not going to show you the data on our GroEL work,


219
0:13:22,333 --> 0:13:25,6
but I will just mention that we have a combination of


220
0:13:25,6 --> 0:13:29,767
genetic data and in vitro biochemical studies


221
0:13:29,767 --> 0:13:35,6
that show how GroEL is required for NodD and luteolin to be active.


222
0:13:35,6 --> 0:13:37,133
In one of the experiments that follows,


223
0:13:37,133 --> 0:13:39,267
I'll be referring to that some more.


224
0:13:39,267 --> 0:13:42,567
Let's now just ask about flavonoids,


225
0:13:42,567 --> 0:13:48,367
including the particular flavonoid luteolin, and NodD.


226
0:13:48,367 --> 0:13:51,933
So in this experiment, we're doing the following:


227
0:13:51,933 --> 0:13:55,767
We're growing Sinorhizobium either without an inducer


228
0:13:55,767 --> 0:13:59,333
or with an inducer, so it either has just culture medium


229
0:13:59,333 --> 0:14:1,833
or it has the plant signal in it.


230
0:14:1,833 --> 0:14:5,267
From those cultured cells, we purify NodD,


231
0:14:5,267 --> 0:14:9,133
and we ask, using electrophoretic mobility shift assay,


232
0:14:9,133 --> 0:14:14,167
does that NodD bind to the nod box promoter or not?


233
0:14:14,167 --> 0:14:17,1
So in pairs here, you're going to be seeing,


234
0:14:17,1 --> 0:14:23,233
in the open boxes, how much DNA binding is accomplished


235
0:14:23,233 --> 0:14:28,667
by this amount of NodD onto the nod box promoter


236
0:14:28,667 --> 0:14:31,533
(the nodulation genes' upstream region).


237
0:14:31,533 --> 0:14:35,367
And this is the amount of binding when the NodD in question


238
0:14:35,367 --> 0:14:37,833
came from cells grown without inducer.


239
0:14:37,833 --> 0:14:43,1
But you can see here that, if the NodD had been purified from


240
0:14:43,1 --> 0:14:46,9
cells grown with inducer, the same amount of NodD


241
0:14:46,9 --> 0:14:50,67
does much more DNA binding.


242
0:14:50,67 --> 0:14:54,867
So it appears that the affinity of NodD for its DNA target


243
0:14:54,867 --> 0:14:58,367
is increased if the NodD was purified from a


244
0:14:58,367 --> 0:15:3,867
cell exposed to the plant inducer luteolin.


245
0:15:3,867 --> 0:15:6,5
Now, this is an in vitro study.


246
0:15:6,5 --> 0:15:9,433
In this case, all of the NodD is being purified from


247
0:15:9,433 --> 0:15:12,6
cells grown with no inducer.


248
0:15:12,6 --> 0:15:19,6
That purified NodD is then incubated with buffer only


249
0:15:19,6 --> 0:15:22,9
or with the plant inducer luteolin.


250
0:15:22,9 --> 0:15:25,533
So we're going to have "minus" for no luteolin and


251
0:15:25,533 --> 0:15:29,9
"plus" for added flavonoid luteolin.


252
0:15:29,9 --> 0:15:32,933
We found early on in data not shown here,


253
0:15:32,933 --> 0:15:38,567
that if this were done with NodD only, there was no result.


254
0:15:38,567 --> 0:15:42,433
However, if we carried this experiment out in a system where the


255
0:15:42,433 --> 0:15:47,8
NodD was also presented with GroEL/GroES,


256
0:15:47,8 --> 0:15:52,867
magnesium, ATP, and inducer, there was a profound effect.


257
0:15:52,867 --> 0:15:55,533
And that's shown here.


258
0:15:55,533 --> 0:15:58,3
The primary data are as follows:


259
0:15:58,3 --> 0:16:2,2
In each case, we've got purified NodD that was incubated


260
0:16:2,2 --> 0:16:7,2
just with magnesium, ATP, and GroES/GroEL here,


261
0:16:7,2 --> 0:16:11,467
or with those same components and luteolin;


262
0:16:11,467 --> 0:16:17,333
just chaperonins and ATP here, or with luteolin;


263
0:16:17,333 --> 0:16:19,767
components only, or with luteolin, and so forth.


264
0:16:19,767 --> 0:16:24,167
And what you can see is that the presence of the luteolin,


265
0:16:24,167 --> 0:16:29,8
the flavonoid inducer, is able to enhance the ability of purified NodD


266
0:16:29,8 --> 0:16:36,933
to bind to its target DNA sequence in the nodulation promoter.


267
0:16:36,933 --> 0:16:42,6
So, what we've got here, then, is a demonstration that,


268
0:16:42,6 --> 0:16:44,867
in the presence of chaperonins


269
0:16:44,867 --> 0:16:48,733
and in the presence of the flavonoid inducer,


270
0:16:48,733 --> 0:16:52,433
again we see enhanced ability of NodD to bind to DNA.


271
0:16:52,433 --> 0:16:55,567
And that's quantified here, if you look at the fraction bound:


272
0:16:55,567 --> 0:16:58,467
absence of luteolin in the incubation mixture,


273
0:16:58,467 --> 0:17:0,8
presence of luteolin.


274
0:17:0,8 --> 0:17:4,367
Now, this was exciting to us because we were starting


275
0:17:4,367 --> 0:17:7,867
to get at the question of how the flavonoids


276
0:17:7,867 --> 0:17:11,33
affect the bacteria's ability to express genes.


277
0:17:11,33 --> 0:17:14,633
But recall, I told you that one of the hallmarks of this system


278
0:17:14,633 --> 0:17:16,233
is that it is specific.


279
0:17:16,233 --> 0:17:18,867
We know that different plants make different flavonoids.


280
0:17:18,867 --> 0:17:22,67
Some of them work in vivo, and some don't.


281
0:17:22,67 --> 0:17:24,2
Is that due to DNA?


282
0:17:24,2 --> 0:17:30,433
Knowing that we should expect any in vitro regulatory system


283
0:17:30,433 --> 0:17:36,167
to explain specificity as well as other aspects of NodD activity,


284
0:17:36,167 --> 0:17:39,867
we carried out an in vivo experiment based on some earlier data


285
0:17:39,867 --> 0:17:44,667
from some years ago, that showed a correlation


286
0:17:44,667 --> 0:17:50,467
between what species a NodD protein came from,


287
0:17:50,467 --> 0:17:54,167
and what kinds of flavonoids a cell would respond to.


288
0:17:54,167 --> 0:17:56,833
So in this experiment, genetically,


289
0:17:56,833 --> 0:18:0,767
we've got a responder cell that's going to report for us


290
0:18:0,767 --> 0:18:3,567
whether nodulation genes are transcribed or not.


291
0:18:3,567 --> 0:18:8,767
It's got a nod gene promoter fused to beta-galatosidase.


292
0:18:8,767 --> 0:18:13,2
But that genetic construct has its own nodD taken away.


293
0:18:13,2 --> 0:18:17,167
There's a deletion for nodD, but there's a nod-lac fusion.


294
0:18:17,167 --> 0:18:20,667
Into that strain, we're going to place one or the other


295
0:18:20,667 --> 0:18:22,5
of these two plasmids.


296
0:18:22,5 --> 0:18:26,8
These plasmids have the same vector, so the same backbone.


297
0:18:26,8 --> 0:18:30,3
They also have a promoter that's exactly the same;


298
0:18:30,3 --> 0:18:34,533
it's a constitutive promoter that's highly expressed.


299
0:18:34,533 --> 0:18:37,567
What's different in them is that, in this strain,


300
0:18:37,567 --> 0:18:41,367
we've got a gene that represents the trimmed open reading frame


301
0:18:41,367 --> 0:18:46,8
for NodD from Sinorhizobium meliloti, which is the symbiont of alfalfa.


302
0:18:46,8 --> 0:18:51,167
Now in this other plasmid, we have the trimmed open reading frame


303
0:18:51,167 --> 0:18:53,767
of NodD from Rhizobium leguminosarum trifolii,


304
0:18:53,767 --> 0:18:56,2
which is a symbiont of clover.


305
0:18:56,2 --> 0:19:1,633
So everything is the same except the actual amino acid sequence


306
0:19:1,633 --> 0:19:3,4
of the two NodDs.


307
0:19:3,4 --> 0:19:6,2
Now we're going to place those into a reporter strain


308
0:19:6,2 --> 0:19:8,567
that has no NodD of its own,


309
0:19:8,567 --> 0:19:12,133
and ask whether nod genes are expressed or not.


310
0:19:12,133 --> 0:19:15,67
So in the left-hand column here, what you're seeing


311
0:19:15,67 --> 0:19:19,867
is whether or not nod genes are expressed in response to luteolin.


312
0:19:19,867 --> 0:19:24,567
And what you can see is that when the cell includes


313
0:19:24,567 --> 0:19:28,933
this plasmid that has the Sinorhizobium meliloti nodD,


314
0:19:28,933 --> 0:19:33,333
then yes, there is nod gene expression.


315
0:19:33,333 --> 0:19:39,333
However, if the strain has the nodD gene that came from Rhizobium trifolii,


316
0:19:39,333 --> 0:19:43,867
then it's kind of iffy, there's not very much expression.


317
0:19:43,867 --> 0:19:48,467
So this suggests that this NodD can induce


318
0:19:48,467 --> 0:19:54,6
in response to this molecule, but this NodD cannot induce very well.


319
0:19:54,6 --> 0:19:56,33
But now let's ask:


320
0:19:56,33 --> 0:20:0,767
How do those reporter strains respond to a completely


321
0:20:0,767 --> 0:20:2,767
different flavonoid, shown here?


322
0:20:2,767 --> 0:20:5,4
You can see for example it has only one hydroxyl,


323
0:20:5,4 --> 0:20:8,4
whereas luteolin has four.


324
0:20:8,4 --> 0:20:11,967
Well, now, if we take the strain containing the Sinorhizobium meliloti


325
0:20:11,967 --> 0:20:15,333
NodD, we see that there's no expression at all.


326
0:20:15,333 --> 0:20:20,9
Whereas the NodD from the Rhizobium trifolii shows good activity.


327
0:20:20,9 --> 0:20:25,7
So this shows that the amino acid sequence of just NodD


328
0:20:25,7 --> 0:20:29,4
is sufficient to account for a different response


329
0:20:29,4 --> 0:20:33,767
to one flavonoid structure versus another flavonoid structure.


330
0:20:33,767 --> 0:20:37,7
We wanted to put that together with the data that I just showed you,


331
0:20:37,7 --> 0:20:44,4
that demonstrated that NodD can bind better to its


332
0:20:44,4 --> 0:20:48,733
nod box target if it's got luteolin present.


333
0:20:48,733 --> 0:20:51,967
But what we found was something of a surprise.


334
0:20:51,967 --> 0:20:54,0
Now what I'm showing here on the top are the


335
0:20:54,0 --> 0:20:56,633
structures of the flavonoid that I've introduced before,


336
0:20:56,633 --> 0:21:0,9
that's luteolin, and a set of flavonoids here


337
0:21:0,9 --> 0:21:7,567
that in vivo do not cause gene expression in Sinorhizobium meliloti.


338
0:21:7,567 --> 0:21:11,867
So we would infer from that that the NodD of Sinorhizobium meliloti


339
0:21:11,867 --> 0:21:14,667
cannot interact productively with any of these,


340
0:21:14,667 --> 0:21:17,0
because they don't work in vivo.


341
0:21:17,0 --> 0:21:20,2
However, if we carried out experiments similar to


342
0:21:20,2 --> 0:21:23,2
those I showed you before with each of these,


343
0:21:23,2 --> 0:21:25,133
we got the following:


344
0:21:25,133 --> 0:21:30,267
Here is a set of data, and here's another.


345
0:21:30,267 --> 0:21:33,467
This for daidzein, that's the molecule up here.


346
0:21:33,467 --> 0:21:36,467
This one for eriodictyol, which is the molecule there.


347
0:21:36,467 --> 0:21:38,533
And what you can see here is that,


348
0:21:38,533 --> 0:21:43,233
if you compare NodD protein incubated with components such as


349
0:21:43,233 --> 0:21:45,633
GroEL, magnesium, ATP,


350
0:21:45,633 --> 0:21:49,867
or those same components plus the flavonoid in question,


351
0:21:49,867 --> 0:21:52,8
these flavonoids, even though they don't work in vivo,


352
0:21:52,8 --> 0:21:57,67
they still enhance the binding of NodD to its target promoter.


353
0:21:57,67 --> 0:22:0,633
That's true for daidzein, that's true for eriodictyol.


354
0:22:0,633 --> 0:22:4,7
And what this shows is that DNA binding is caused


355
0:22:4,7 --> 0:22:10,433
even from flavonoids that are not active.


356
0:22:10,433 --> 0:22:13,833
And some of the examples of the data


357
0:22:13,833 --> 0:22:16,2
and a quantification are shown here.


358
0:22:16,2 --> 0:22:22,633
This shows a gel shift of NodD from Sinorhizobium meliloti


359
0:22:22,633 --> 0:22:25,967
presented with buffer only,


360
0:22:25,967 --> 0:22:31,833
with daidzein, luteolin, and naringenin, three inducers,


361
0:22:31,833 --> 0:22:35,33
of which only the luteolin is really active in vivo.


362
0:22:35,33 --> 0:22:38,33
Nonetheless, all of them cause gel shifting,


363
0:22:38,33 --> 0:22:39,533
and that's quantified here.


364
0:22:39,533 --> 0:22:44,8
What you can see in this graph is NodD with no inducer


365
0:22:44,8 --> 0:22:48,667
of any kind added, and NodD with the three different inducers,


366
0:22:48,667 --> 0:22:51,733
some of which are active in vivo and some of which aren't.


367
0:22:51,733 --> 0:22:56,0
So right now, our working model is that NodD


368
0:22:56,0 --> 0:22:59,633
is able to bind DNA with an increased affinity


369
0:22:59,633 --> 0:23:2,67
no matter what flavonoid is there.


370
0:23:2,67 --> 0:23:6,8
And in fact, the flavonoids that do not work in vivo


371
0:23:6,8 --> 0:23:10,633
may actually bind to NodD and inhibit the ability


372
0:23:10,633 --> 0:23:13,233
of the correct flavonoid to induce,


373
0:23:13,233 --> 0:23:16,1
by causing unproductive DNA binding.


374
0:23:16,1 --> 0:23:21,7
So DNA binding does not explain the specificity of NodD


375
0:23:21,7 --> 0:23:25,5
for the flavonoid inducers that come from different plants.


376
0:23:25,5 --> 0:23:27,8
That leaves us with a series of new experiments


377
0:23:27,8 --> 0:23:30,667
to do in the future, and among them,


378
0:23:30,667 --> 0:23:32,367
what we want to ask is:


379
0:23:32,367 --> 0:23:35,1
Does the presence of the correct flavonoid


380
0:23:35,1 --> 0:23:39,967
somehow affect the interaction of NodD with RNA polymerase?


381
0:23:39,967 --> 0:23:44,7
And that's led us in turn to ask about the components


382
0:23:44,7 --> 0:23:47,6
of RNA polymerase, and in the end,


383
0:23:47,6 --> 0:23:52,667
we hope also to work in vitro with the guanosine tetraphosphate


384
0:23:52,667 --> 0:23:56,1
and ask about all of these components together.


385
0:23:56,1 --> 0:24:0,267
But in this next section, I'll just like to talk about RNA polymerase.


386
0:24:0,267 --> 0:24:3,767
In particular, I want to talk about the sigma factors.


387
0:24:3,767 --> 0:24:9,33
Now just as a review, RNA polymerase in prokaryotes has


388
0:24:9,33 --> 0:24:14,133
a core made of two α subunits (two copies of the α subunit),


389
0:24:14,133 --> 0:24:18,667
a β and β' subunit, and in addition, a sigma factor,


390
0:24:18,667 --> 0:24:22,933
which has multiple domains, and they're shown here in this cartoon,


391
0:24:22,933 --> 0:24:25,6
which is derived from E. coli sigma factor.


392
0:24:25,6 --> 0:24:29,433
And what we now know from work in many labs over the years,


393
0:24:29,433 --> 0:24:33,333
is that there are many kinds of sigma factors.


394
0:24:33,333 --> 0:24:36,33
Originally, the one that was best characterized


395
0:24:36,33 --> 0:24:41,467
was the housekeeping, or rpoD, σ70 type of sigma factor.


396
0:24:41,467 --> 0:24:45,433
And that's the form of sigma factor that reconstitutes


397
0:24:45,433 --> 0:24:48,733
with RNA polymerase for the transcription of most genes


398
0:24:48,733 --> 0:24:51,167
in E. coli and in other organisms.


399
0:24:51,167 --> 0:24:56,333
The sigma factor here has various alpha-helices


400
0:24:56,333 --> 0:24:59,333
and other subdomains; that's what these letters are for.


401
0:24:59,333 --> 0:25:2,9
But this is one polypeptide as it interacts with different parts


402
0:25:2,9 --> 0:25:6,767
of the β', β, and α subunits.


403
0:25:6,767 --> 0:25:8,9
But in addition to the rpoD,


404
0:25:8,9 --> 0:25:12,8
there are other sigma factors, a stress sigma factor rpoS,


405
0:25:12,8 --> 0:25:17,167
which is very prominent in survival responses of E. coli;


406
0:25:17,167 --> 0:25:19,0
heat shock rpoH;


407
0:25:19,0 --> 0:25:22,233
in some enterics, there's also rpoN,


408
0:25:22,233 --> 0:25:26,367
which is important for nitrogen metabolism and for other functions


409
0:25:26,367 --> 0:25:29,367
such as nitrogen fixation in Klebsiella;


410
0:25:29,367 --> 0:25:32,433
and a number of other sigma factors,


411
0:25:32,433 --> 0:25:39,133
and I'm going to come back in a few minutes to one in particular, the rpoE.


412
0:25:39,133 --> 0:25:42,633
In Sinorhizobium meliloti, our annotation showed


413
0:25:42,633 --> 0:25:46,3
that there's at least double that number of sigma factors.


414
0:25:46,3 --> 0:25:48,333
One of the striking differences with enterics


415
0:25:48,333 --> 0:25:51,7
is that there's no copy of rpoS.


416
0:25:51,7 --> 0:25:54,367
However, there is a housekeeping sigma,


417
0:25:54,367 --> 0:25:58,833
it looks very comparable to the σ70 of E. coli.


418
0:25:58,833 --> 0:26:4,367
There are two copies of the rpoH or so-called heat-shock sigma.


419
0:26:4,367 --> 0:26:7,533
There are ten copies at least of rpoE,


420
0:26:7,533 --> 0:26:13,533
in addition to the fecI originally identified for relationship to iron control,


421
0:26:13,533 --> 0:26:17,3
and the rpoN that's important for nitrogen fixation.


422
0:26:17,3 --> 0:26:20,5
In the following section, I'd like to tell you some of our


423
0:26:20,5 --> 0:26:23,767
new work on rpoH and refer briefly to


424
0:26:23,767 --> 0:26:28,3
some emerging work on rpoE.


425
0:26:28,3 --> 0:26:34,4
We wanted to know what do those two different copies of rpoH do?


426
0:26:34,4 --> 0:26:36,267
Are they important for heat shock?


427
0:26:36,267 --> 0:26:38,333
Are they important for symbiosis?


428
0:26:38,333 --> 0:26:42,67
Let's start with a look at how these are expressed.


429
0:26:42,67 --> 0:26:46,367
On the left-hand column, you can see how the two different copies,


430
0:26:46,367 --> 0:26:51,867
rpoH1 and rpoH2, are expressed in free-living cells.


431
0:26:51,867 --> 0:26:55,733
The rpoH1 tends to be expressed mostly


432
0:26:55,733 --> 0:27:0,67
in late log (late exponential) and stationary,


433
0:27:0,67 --> 0:27:4,6
but rpoH2 is expressed mostly in stationary cells.


434
0:27:4,6 --> 0:27:6,667
If you grind up nodules and ask whether


435
0:27:6,667 --> 0:27:9,3
these rpoH genes are transcribed,


436
0:27:9,3 --> 0:27:14,4
you can see that rpoH1 is transcribed, yes, it's present in nodules;


437
0:27:14,4 --> 0:27:18,333
but rpoH2 was not detectable in our assays.


438
0:27:18,333 --> 0:27:22,133
That leads to surprise in a minute, as I'll tell you.


439
0:27:22,133 --> 0:27:27,3
Knocking out one or the other or both of these rpoH genes


440
0:27:27,3 --> 0:27:31,3
leads to some phenotypes in the free-living state.


441
0:27:31,3 --> 0:27:36,367
The rpoH1 mutant is very sensitive to high temperature.


442
0:27:36,367 --> 0:27:40,133
rpoH2 does not appear to have much of a phenotype,


443
0:27:40,133 --> 0:27:43,233
but the double mutant, similar to the rpoH1,


444
0:27:43,233 --> 0:27:46,5
is affected by high temperature.


445
0:27:46,5 --> 0:27:49,833
Here's the surprise about the symbiosis.


446
0:27:49,833 --> 0:27:56,367
What we found was that a mutation in rpoH1 was Fix-.


447
0:27:56,367 --> 0:28:0,333
rpoH2, if it's knocked out only by itself,


448
0:28:0,333 --> 0:28:3,367
does not appear to have any symbiotic defect.


449
0:28:3,367 --> 0:28:7,933
However, if you knock out both rpoH1 and rpoH2,


450
0:28:7,933 --> 0:28:11,367
and despite the fact that rpoH2 doesn't seem


451
0:28:11,367 --> 0:28:13,967
to be detectable as a transcript in nodules,


452
0:28:13,967 --> 0:28:16,3
remarkably, that's Nod-.


453
0:28:16,3 --> 0:28:21,467
That means that one or the other of those rpoH sigma factors


454
0:28:21,467 --> 0:28:24,833
has to be functioning in order for the symbiosis


455
0:28:24,833 --> 0:28:28,4
to proceed past some of the very earliest stages.


456
0:28:28,4 --> 0:28:33,267
So that's a mystery that we are beginning to look at in more detail.


457
0:28:33,267 --> 0:28:36,33
Meanwhile, we've also asked about the spectrum of genes


458
0:28:36,33 --> 0:28:38,4
that are expressed.


459
0:28:38,4 --> 0:28:41,433
In the following experiment, we used the Affymetrix chip


460
0:28:41,433 --> 0:28:44,567
that I described earlier.


461
0:28:44,567 --> 0:28:47,533
And what we're going to be doing here is taking a look


462
0:28:47,533 --> 0:28:53,9
at the transcripts in wild-type cells, and in each of the two single mutants,


463
0:28:53,9 --> 0:28:58,8
and the rpoH1H2 double mutant, as we grow them in culture,


464
0:28:58,8 --> 0:29:1,233
give them a heat shock, and then harvest the


465
0:29:1,233 --> 0:29:5,3
RNA to assess global transcription.


466
0:29:5,3 --> 0:29:10,33
Now, in the following, I'll show you summaries of our data.


467
0:29:10,33 --> 0:29:15,5
Remarkably, we found that, when you heat shock wild-type rhizobia,


468
0:29:15,5 --> 0:29:19,533
almost a third of the genes in the genome, over 2000 genes,


469
0:29:19,533 --> 0:29:21,367
are affected one way or another.


470
0:29:21,367 --> 0:29:25,433
One thousand of them go up, another thousand go down.


471
0:29:25,433 --> 0:29:29,6
Another intriguing feature of this transcription picture is shown here.


472
0:29:29,6 --> 0:29:32,9
Now, if you take the entire genome of Sinorhizobium and you look


473
0:29:32,9 --> 0:29:34,767
at the distribution of open reading frames,


474
0:29:34,767 --> 0:29:37,367
you can see that more than a half of the open reading frames


475
0:29:37,367 --> 0:29:41,433
are in the chromosome, and that's shown in this here,


476
0:29:41,433 --> 0:29:43,667
so that's the chromosome.


477
0:29:43,667 --> 0:29:48,333
pSymB accounts for this many, as a fraction of the whole,


478
0:29:48,333 --> 0:29:51,467
and this is the number that are in pSymA.


479
0:29:51,467 --> 0:29:53,6
That's the total genome annotation,


480
0:29:53,6 --> 0:29:56,733
but if you look at those 2000 genes that are changed


481
0:29:56,733 --> 0:29:58,9
one way or the other by heat shock,


482
0:29:58,9 --> 0:30:2,5
what you see is that the chromosome is underrepresented,


483
0:30:2,5 --> 0:30:5,0
and the two Sym plasmids are overrepresented.


484
0:30:5,0 --> 0:30:7,733
So that, in and of itself, was kind of intriguing,


485
0:30:7,733 --> 0:30:10,1
especially when you put it together with the fact that the


486
0:30:10,1 --> 0:30:17,433
double mutant of those sigma factors is very defective in symbiosis.


487
0:30:17,433 --> 0:30:19,633
Here was another surprise:


488
0:30:19,633 --> 0:30:23,433
If you take a look in this picture only at the genes


489
0:30:23,433 --> 0:30:27,767
that are increased in heat-shocked cells, and that's, as I said,


490
0:30:27,767 --> 0:30:33,5
over a thousand, what we find is that the large majority


491
0:30:33,5 --> 0:30:37,7
of those are increased by heat shock


492
0:30:37,7 --> 0:30:42,733
even if the two rpoH sigma factors are both knocked out.


493
0:30:42,733 --> 0:30:44,2
And that's shown here.


494
0:30:44,2 --> 0:30:48,567
These are the increased genes by heat shock in a wild-type,


495
0:30:48,567 --> 0:30:52,333
and this blue circle shows those genes


496
0:30:52,333 --> 0:30:57,667
that do not get enhanced in a mutant.


497
0:30:57,667 --> 0:30:59,9
These are the genes that do not get enhanced


498
0:30:59,9 --> 0:31:4,33
by heat shock in an rpoH1H2 double mutant.


499
0:31:4,33 --> 0:31:8,967
And the overlap is only about 200.


500
0:31:8,967 --> 0:31:13,533
So, only a minority of the heat-shock genes are apparently


501
0:31:13,533 --> 0:31:16,767
controlled by the rpoH sigma factors.


502
0:31:16,767 --> 0:31:19,3
So, they're doing other things,


503
0:31:19,3 --> 0:31:22,633
and some other regulatory system is taking the job that,


504
0:31:22,633 --> 0:31:25,9
in E. coli, would be done just by rpoH.


505
0:31:25,9 --> 0:31:29,8
Another surprise that needs to be followed up.


506
0:31:29,8 --> 0:31:33,467
So I'd now like to ask the question:


507
0:31:33,467 --> 0:31:35,833
How about the other sigma factors?


508
0:31:35,833 --> 0:31:37,9
As we move forward looking at rpoH,


509
0:31:37,9 --> 0:31:40,433
we know that there are more sigma factors to


510
0:31:40,433 --> 0:31:43,667
account for in Sinorhizobium meliloti.


511
0:31:43,667 --> 0:31:47,8
Now one that's important for sure, that I won't say more about,


512
0:31:47,8 --> 0:31:53,133
is obviously the rpoN σ54 sigma factor known to be


513
0:31:53,133 --> 0:31:55,967
required for the transcription of nitrogenase and a


514
0:31:55,967 --> 0:32:0,333
number of the other genes in the late differentiated state.


515
0:32:0,333 --> 0:32:6,3
The rpoE family presents some other very intriguing puzzles.


516
0:32:6,3 --> 0:32:12,7
Now, rpoE was identified in E. coli as a sigma factor


517
0:32:12,7 --> 0:32:18,167
responsible for genes that were triggered by denaturation


518
0:32:18,167 --> 0:32:20,467
of proteins in the periplasm.


519
0:32:20,467 --> 0:32:25,133
They're controlled post-transcriptionally by an anti-sigma factor,


520
0:32:25,133 --> 0:32:27,5
which captures them in an inactive form,


521
0:32:27,5 --> 0:32:30,7
unless the anti-sigma factor is somehow triggered


522
0:32:30,7 --> 0:32:33,333
to release the rpoE sigma,


523
0:32:33,333 --> 0:32:36,533
which can then go and associate with core polymerase


524
0:32:36,533 --> 0:32:38,9
and turn on a large number of genes.


525
0:32:38,9 --> 0:32:42,9
So we began to look genetically at these rpoE genes.


526
0:32:42,9 --> 0:32:49,367
We found that the single mutants in each of the rpoE


527
0:32:49,367 --> 0:32:52,467
open reading frames don't have any particular phenotype,


528
0:32:52,467 --> 0:32:53,9
and that's shown here. Right?


529
0:32:53,9 --> 0:33:1,967
Single rpoEs have some slight membrane sensitivity, but basically,


530
0:33:1,967 --> 0:33:6,267
they seem normal in culture and they're normal for symbiosis.


531
0:33:6,267 --> 0:33:9,5
We've now also gone through and made all of the double mutants


532
0:33:9,5 --> 0:33:12,0
for each of those sigma factors.


533
0:33:12,0 --> 0:33:16,1
What we find there is that some of these rpoE sigma factor


534
0:33:16,1 --> 0:33:20,33
double mutants have a symbiotic defect.


535
0:33:20,33 --> 0:33:23,5
They make nodules, but nodules do not fix nitrogen.


536
0:33:23,5 --> 0:33:27,567
That suggests that somewhere in the transition between the


537
0:33:27,567 --> 0:33:31,833
beginning of nodule formation and the differentiation of the bacteria,


538
0:33:31,833 --> 0:33:37,933
essential genes require the activity of some of the rpoE sigma factors.


539
0:33:37,933 --> 0:33:41,967
It also points out the likelihood that these are at least partially redundant;


540
0:33:41,967 --> 0:33:44,6
that's why none of the single mutants had a phenotype,


541
0:33:44,6 --> 0:33:47,533
but some of the doubles do.


542
0:33:47,533 --> 0:33:51,967
So, in our future work, we are now asking,


543
0:33:51,967 --> 0:33:55,6
which of the genes are controlled by each of these rpoEs,


544
0:33:55,6 --> 0:33:59,467
and can we use transcriptional analysis of the global picture


545
0:33:59,467 --> 0:34:2,333
of rpoE control to understand the redundancy


546
0:34:2,333 --> 0:34:6,3
and understand where they're required in symbiosis.


547
0:34:6,3 --> 0:34:10,833
So, from that view of the RNA polymerase,


548
0:34:10,833 --> 0:34:13,6
I'd like to go to a few more case histories.


549
0:34:13,6 --> 0:34:18,467
But we need to keep in mind that whatever stages we're looking at,


550
0:34:18,467 --> 0:34:22,133
we may need to consider the global picture of RNA


551
0:34:22,133 --> 0:34:25,467
polymerase and of other regulatory contexts


552
0:34:25,467 --> 0:34:28,767
to understand how specific regulatory circuits


553
0:34:28,767 --> 0:34:31,233
are able to function in symbiosis.


554
0:34:31,233 --> 0:34:33,6
Now, my next topic is about the control of


555
0:34:33,6 --> 0:34:36,33
extracellular polysaccharides.


556
0:34:36,33 --> 0:34:41,133
EPS, extracellular polysaccharides, are required for symbiosis.


557
0:34:41,133 --> 0:34:43,9
And I'll tell you in this section about how these are


558
0:34:43,9 --> 0:34:49,833
regulated by a family, that includes a periplasmic regulator


559
0:34:49,833 --> 0:34:52,367
and a two-component regulatory system.


560
0:34:52,367 --> 0:34:55,533
Now, the EPS in Sinorhizobium meliloti has been studied


561
0:34:55,533 --> 0:34:58,8
in detail by Graham Walker and his colleagues at MIT,


562
0:34:58,8 --> 0:35:0,367
over a number of years.


563
0:35:0,367 --> 0:35:3,667
The name of this exopolysaccharide is succinoglycan


564
0:35:3,667 --> 0:35:6,33
because it is modified by acidic groups,


565
0:35:6,33 --> 0:35:8,5
including succinyl groups.


566
0:35:8,5 --> 0:35:11,867
And they have shown that mutants which are not able to


567
0:35:11,867 --> 0:35:17,133
synthesize succinoglycan are able to provoke nodules


568
0:35:17,133 --> 0:35:21,367
to form on alfalfa as a host, but they cannot invade.


569
0:35:21,367 --> 0:35:26,5
So what's shown here, which is a root hair with bacteria invading,


570
0:35:26,5 --> 0:35:30,9
and these bacteria are all labeled with green fluorescent protein,


571
0:35:30,9 --> 0:35:34,833
allowing you to follow their invasion into the plant.


572
0:35:34,833 --> 0:35:38,167
This process will not occur unless you have the


573
0:35:38,167 --> 0:35:41,133
extracellular polysaccharides.


574
0:35:41,133 --> 0:35:44,9
Now here's some mutants that were found by Graham Walker


575
0:35:44,9 --> 0:35:49,633
and his colleagues that were able to make polysaccharide,


576
0:35:49,633 --> 0:35:51,167
but they don't make the right amount.


577
0:35:51,167 --> 0:35:53,0
In fact, they make too much.


578
0:35:53,0 --> 0:35:56,567
So what you're seeing here are bacteria that are streaked


579
0:35:56,567 --> 0:36:0,2
on a solid medium including a dye called calcofluor.


580
0:36:0,2 --> 0:36:2,9
Calcofluor in solution is not fluorescent,


581
0:36:2,9 --> 0:36:6,933
but when it binds to certain beta-glucans, it becomes fluorescent.


582
0:36:6,933 --> 0:36:10,4
It's used sometimes as a laundry brightener because,


583
0:36:10,4 --> 0:36:13,8
among other glucans, calcofluor can bind to cellulose,


584
0:36:13,8 --> 0:36:16,367
which is the constituent of cotton.


585
0:36:16,367 --> 0:36:18,933
And when it binds and becomes fluorescent,


586
0:36:18,933 --> 0:36:21,867
that means that any cotton fabric that has calcofluor


587
0:36:21,867 --> 0:36:26,567
will fluoresce slightly in sunlight, because there's a little bit of UV in sunlight.


588
0:36:26,567 --> 0:36:29,333
Picks up the UV, fluoresces bright blue,


589
0:36:29,333 --> 0:36:32,233
that makes the laundry look whiter than white.


590
0:36:32,233 --> 0:36:33,867
Now in the case of Sinorhizobium,


591
0:36:33,867 --> 0:36:37,967
it's lucky for us that the succinoglycan also binds calcofluor.


592
0:36:37,967 --> 0:36:42,1
So a wild type, which you can see here, has a light,


593
0:36:42,1 --> 0:36:47,667
white glow when it's grown on calcofluor medium


594
0:36:47,667 --> 0:36:50,7
and exposed to UV light.


595
0:36:50,7 --> 0:36:56,267
But two mutants, here exoR mutant that's defective,


596
0:36:56,267 --> 0:37:0,733
and here an exoS mutant that's constitutively active


597
0:37:0,733 --> 0:37:4,3
(that is, it's hypermorphic), each of these


598
0:37:4,3 --> 0:37:6,433
makes too much polysaccharide.


599
0:37:6,433 --> 0:37:9,4
And actually, it turns out that's not good for symbiosis either.


600
0:37:9,4 --> 0:37:11,767
If a bacterium makes too much polysaccharide,


601
0:37:11,767 --> 0:37:14,233
it doesn't do very well at invasion.


602
0:37:14,233 --> 0:37:15,933
So what's going on here?


603
0:37:15,933 --> 0:37:18,2
Why does this mutant


604
0:37:18,2 --> 0:37:20,8
make too much polysaccharide when it's overexpressed,


605
0:37:20,8 --> 0:37:23,267
and this mutant makes too much polysaccharide


606
0:37:23,267 --> 0:37:24,533
when it's defective?


607
0:37:24,533 --> 0:37:27,367
Well, we would guess that that's because this is a negative regulator


608
0:37:27,367 --> 0:37:29,733
and this is a positive regulator.


609
0:37:29,733 --> 0:37:34,1
But we took these and found, fortuitously,


610
0:37:34,1 --> 0:37:39,33
some unexpected phenotypes that went beyond polysaccharide.


611
0:37:39,33 --> 0:37:41,5
Here's the first of those:


612
0:37:41,5 --> 0:37:45,733
And that is that mutants defective in exoR


613
0:37:45,733 --> 0:37:51,433
or overproductive of/overactive in exoS are not motile.


614
0:37:51,433 --> 0:37:56,533
They are not able to swarm on a motility plate, and that's shown here.


615
0:37:56,533 --> 0:37:59,3
This is wild type; you can see that on this particular agar,


616
0:37:59,3 --> 0:38:3,633
it's able to swim around, it makes a big, wide colony.


617
0:38:3,633 --> 0:38:7,833
But the exoR- mutant or the exoS overexpression mutant,


618
0:38:7,833 --> 0:38:10,4
both of these are not able to swarm.


619
0:38:10,4 --> 0:38:12,4
That's because they're not motile.


620
0:38:12,4 --> 0:38:16,233
This plate also lets me introduce to you two genetic constructs


621
0:38:16,233 --> 0:38:18,233
that give us clues.


622
0:38:18,233 --> 0:38:22,133
In the first one, over here, we've taken this exoS mutant,


623
0:38:22,133 --> 0:38:27,3
and we've taken a wild-type ExoR (that's what we


624
0:38:27,3 --> 0:38:31,33
infer to be an inhibitory factor)...


625
0:38:31,33 --> 0:38:34,133
we've taken ExoR and we're overexpressing it.


626
0:38:34,133 --> 0:38:39,267
If we overexpress that ExoR in the presence


627
0:38:39,267 --> 0:38:42,4
of this overexpressed ExoS,


628
0:38:42,4 --> 0:38:47,33
it apparently allows the cells to be normal again.


629
0:38:47,33 --> 0:38:53,333
So that suggests to us that ExoR actually inhibits ExoS,


630
0:38:53,333 --> 0:38:56,0
and even if you have a hyperactive ExoS,


631
0:38:56,0 --> 0:38:58,6
if you then add more and more ExoR,


632
0:38:58,6 --> 0:39:2,633
you're able to get things back to the wild-type balance.


633
0:39:2,633 --> 0:39:5,767
Now, the second clue was also very interesting.


634
0:39:5,767 --> 0:39:12,1
Here's exoR, and in a population of exoR mutants,


635
0:39:12,1 --> 0:39:14,67
which are, as you can see, nonmotile,


636
0:39:14,67 --> 0:39:16,267
a suppressor arose.


637
0:39:16,267 --> 0:39:20,2
That suppressor allows the exoR to be motile again.


638
0:39:20,2 --> 0:39:22,9
So when we tracked down the gene and sequenced it,


639
0:39:22,9 --> 0:39:29,833
we found that that suppressor was actually in a gene called chvI.


640
0:39:29,833 --> 0:39:34,933
ChvI is a DNA-binding protein that's linked to ExoS,


641
0:39:34,933 --> 0:39:36,833
which is a response regulator.


642
0:39:36,833 --> 0:39:40,333
ExoS and ChvI are a two-component system.


643
0:39:40,333 --> 0:39:42,867
And without even asking about ExoS,


644
0:39:42,867 --> 0:39:47,533
what we did was to mutate ExoR and find a suppressor


645
0:39:47,533 --> 0:39:52,8
that was in the substrate of ExoS.


646
0:39:52,8 --> 0:39:58,333
Now, motility appeared to show us a linkage of the exoS


647
0:39:58,333 --> 0:40:1,7
and the exoR with the chvI,


648
0:40:1,7 --> 0:40:4,67
but how about other phenotypes?


649
0:40:4,67 --> 0:40:8,633
Well, one of the other dramatic changes that happens


650
0:40:8,633 --> 0:40:16,67
in an exoR- or exoS constitutive bacterium


651
0:40:16,67 --> 0:40:22,8
is that genes which are normally upregulated in a wild type


652
0:40:22,8 --> 0:40:26,567
are very low in expression in those mutants.


653
0:40:26,567 --> 0:40:29,867
And you can see that here, if you take a look here,


654
0:40:29,867 --> 0:40:31,4
these blue panels.


655
0:40:31,4 --> 0:40:34,933
These are actually two duplicates of an exoR-


656
0:40:34,933 --> 0:40:39,267
and an exoS constitutive, showing a whole set of genes


657
0:40:39,267 --> 0:40:42,6
that are not appropriately regulated if exoS


658
0:40:42,6 --> 0:40:47,267
and exoR are in those defective conditions.


659
0:40:47,267 --> 0:40:49,133
The two suppressors that I showed you,


660
0:40:49,133 --> 0:40:52,3
however, the ones that reverse motility?


661
0:40:52,3 --> 0:40:57,0
They also reverse the transcription defects


662
0:40:57,0 --> 0:40:59,233
and restore them to wild-type levels,


663
0:40:59,233 --> 0:41:3,133
and that's shown in these panels on the right,


664
0:41:3,133 --> 0:41:8,9
where you can see that coordinate restoration


665
0:41:8,9 --> 0:41:13,233
of a wild-type function from the same suppressors.


666
0:41:13,233 --> 0:41:18,2
So, what we find is that the motility defect


667
0:41:18,2 --> 0:41:24,33
and in the transcription profiles, exoS and exoR and chvI


668
0:41:24,33 --> 0:41:29,533
all appear to be targeting coordinated functions.


669
0:41:29,533 --> 0:41:33,0
We believe, based on some biochemical data,


670
0:41:33,0 --> 0:41:36,33
that the system works as follows:


671
0:41:36,33 --> 0:41:41,33
We've shown biochemically that ExoR is in the periplasm


672
0:41:41,33 --> 0:41:44,767
in between the cytoplasmic membrane and the outer membrane.


673
0:41:44,767 --> 0:41:48,133
So as a negative regulator that's present in the periplasm,


674
0:41:48,133 --> 0:41:50,633
it's unique at this point.


675
0:41:50,633 --> 0:41:53,3
There's no model for how this might be working,


676
0:41:53,3 --> 0:41:57,233
because there's no other proteins of that type yet reported.


677
0:41:57,233 --> 0:42:2,467
ExoS and ChvI are the two-component system,


678
0:42:2,467 --> 0:42:6,9
with ExoS as a histidine kinase and ChvI is the


679
0:42:6,9 --> 0:42:9,833
response regulator that binds to DNA.


680
0:42:9,833 --> 0:42:12,5
And through ChvI, all of these functions,


681
0:42:12,5 --> 0:42:16,167
including motility, transcription, and we've also shown biofilm formation


682
0:42:16,167 --> 0:42:19,767
and other functions... they're all controlled.


683
0:42:19,767 --> 0:42:23,133
Now, this presents us with a lot of mysteries.


684
0:42:23,133 --> 0:42:28,567
For example, his-kinases (sensor kinases) are presumably


685
0:42:28,567 --> 0:42:31,0
responding to some kind of change in the environment,


686
0:42:31,0 --> 0:42:33,533
some signal. What is it?


687
0:42:33,533 --> 0:42:36,467
Is the plant sending something?


688
0:42:36,467 --> 0:42:39,33
Are other bacteria sending something?


689
0:42:39,33 --> 0:42:41,2
What are the factors in the


690
0:42:41,2 --> 0:42:45,4
environment that control the activity of ExoS?


691
0:42:45,4 --> 0:42:47,833
ExoR as well, how does that act?


692
0:42:47,833 --> 0:42:50,3
Does that also respond to the environment?


693
0:42:50,3 --> 0:42:52,533
So these are some of the mysteries that we hope to


694
0:42:52,533 --> 0:42:55,733
work on at the molecular level,


695
0:42:55,733 --> 0:42:58,133
and one of the other directions we're going right now


696
0:42:58,133 --> 0:43:5,167
is to look very specifically for the targets of the ChvI DNA-binding protein.


697
0:43:5,167 --> 0:43:10,7
Now, ExoR and ExoS, as I showed you, control a lot of genes.


698
0:43:10,7 --> 0:43:12,567
There are more genes out there.


699
0:43:12,567 --> 0:43:18,6
Now we already know that this regulon is required for exopolysaccharide,


700
0:43:18,6 --> 0:43:21,2
it has to be just right in order to get invasion,


701
0:43:21,2 --> 0:43:24,367
you saw that there are many genes that are controlled.


702
0:43:24,367 --> 0:43:27,167
But we also think that, as you go from invasion


703
0:43:27,167 --> 0:43:29,267
all the way to differentiation,


704
0:43:29,267 --> 0:43:32,567
there are many more genes than that.


705
0:43:32,567 --> 0:43:35,867
First, in a promoter trap screen, genetically,


706
0:43:35,867 --> 0:43:39,267
we found several dozen bacterial promoters


707
0:43:39,267 --> 0:43:43,5
that appear to turn on in between the beginning of invasion


708
0:43:43,5 --> 0:43:45,333
and the final differentiation.


709
0:43:45,333 --> 0:43:47,867
So, we're looking at those genes to ask,


710
0:43:47,867 --> 0:43:50,533
what is it that controls them?


711
0:43:50,533 --> 0:43:54,8
Furthermore, we've recently carried out more genetic screens


712
0:43:54,8 --> 0:43:57,367
of the type that I described in the beginning --


713
0:43:57,367 --> 0:44:0,933
putting random bacterial mutants on plants and asking whether


714
0:44:0,933 --> 0:44:4,6
those bacteria are able to cause nodules to form


715
0:44:4,6 --> 0:44:6,833
and whether those nodules are functional --


716
0:44:6,833 --> 0:44:9,967
to find more nodulation mutants and fixation mutants.


717
0:44:9,967 --> 0:44:12,833
We have already found several new genes


718
0:44:12,833 --> 0:44:15,333
not previously recovered in earlier screens,


719
0:44:15,333 --> 0:44:17,667
for transporters for example,


720
0:44:17,667 --> 0:44:21,5
which suggests that the bacteria must be able to import or perhaps


721
0:44:21,5 --> 0:44:24,967
export materials in order to accomplish nitrogen fixation


722
0:44:24,967 --> 0:44:29,467
and differentiation. And in addition,


723
0:44:29,467 --> 0:44:34,233
we've taken the transcriptional approach as follows:


724
0:44:34,233 --> 0:44:37,767
So based on our Affymetrix transcription studies,


725
0:44:37,767 --> 0:44:43,33
we were able to show that hundreds of bacterial genes change,


726
0:44:43,33 --> 0:44:46,267
if you compare cultured bacteria to bacteria in nodules.


727
0:44:46,267 --> 0:44:52,0
Over 300 genes increase in expression, including the obvious suspects,


728
0:44:52,0 --> 0:44:55,2
such as nitrogenase and fixation genes.


729
0:44:55,2 --> 0:44:59,67
But many more than that, 900-some genes, go down.


730
0:44:59,67 --> 0:45:2,833
These decreased genes include biosynthetic functions


731
0:45:2,833 --> 0:45:6,67
such as amino acid synthesis and others.


732
0:45:6,67 --> 0:45:11,333
So the bacteria is having a major change in its gene expression profile.


733
0:45:11,333 --> 0:45:14,2
The plant changes as well.


734
0:45:14,2 --> 0:45:17,9
Now, several hundred genes change,


735
0:45:17,9 --> 0:45:21,567
of which 250 or so increase in the expression,


736
0:45:21,567 --> 0:45:25,667
and many plant genes decrease in their expression as well.


737
0:45:25,667 --> 0:45:28,267
Now what we wanted to do was ask something about


738
0:45:28,267 --> 0:45:31,433
the strategy of how the plants and the bacteria


739
0:45:31,433 --> 0:45:33,967
control their transcription in these nodules.


740
0:45:33,967 --> 0:45:37,4
So what we're going to do in the next set of experiments


741
0:45:37,4 --> 0:45:42,4
is compare the transcripts in a wild-type nodule, such as this one here,


742
0:45:42,4 --> 0:45:46,433
to a nodule that's being established on a wild-type plant


743
0:45:46,433 --> 0:45:49,267
by a bacterium that's mutated.


744
0:45:49,267 --> 0:45:51,0
Now what mutant are we going to use?


745
0:45:51,0 --> 0:45:53,9
We're going to use a mutant called fixJ.


746
0:45:53,9 --> 0:45:58,4
Now the protein FixJ is required for bacteria in


747
0:45:58,4 --> 0:46:2,533
the nodule to transcribe the nitrogenase, or nif genes.


748
0:46:2,533 --> 0:46:4,0
And that works as follows:


749
0:46:4,0 --> 0:46:7,433
Leghemoglobin, which is present in the plant cytoplasm,


750
0:46:7,433 --> 0:46:10,2
shown in this cartoon, buffers oxygen


751
0:46:10,2 --> 0:46:13,33
so that the free oxygen tension is very low


752
0:46:13,33 --> 0:46:17,2
(although oxygen is delivered at a high rate by leghemoglobin).


753
0:46:17,2 --> 0:46:20,4
Now, the low oxygen is able to interact with


754
0:46:20,4 --> 0:46:23,967
the two-component regulatory system, FixL and FixJ,


755
0:46:23,967 --> 0:46:27,0
that activates a signal transduction cascade


756
0:46:27,0 --> 0:46:30,233
that results in nitrogen fixation.


757
0:46:30,233 --> 0:46:32,233
So, here's the plant cytoplasm


758
0:46:32,233 --> 0:46:35,467
and the bacterium responding to the plant's signal.


759
0:46:35,467 --> 0:46:41,567
If you have no FixJ in the bacterium, then there's no nitrogen fixation.


760
0:46:41,567 --> 0:46:45,833
So the bacterium provokes a nodule, it gets into the plant,


761
0:46:45,833 --> 0:46:47,6
but then it doesn't work.


762
0:46:47,6 --> 0:46:51,8
So the RNA transcription studies we're doing now


763
0:46:51,8 --> 0:46:56,233
are going to compare a nodule made with wild-type bacteria


764
0:46:56,233 --> 0:46:58,9
and a nodule that's made and infected


765
0:46:58,9 --> 0:47:1,67
with bacteria that then don't fix nitrogen.


766
0:47:1,67 --> 0:47:2,933
And here are results.


767
0:47:2,933 --> 0:47:5,9
Let's take a look at the wild type first.


768
0:47:5,9 --> 0:47:9,67
As I mentioned... and by the way,


769
0:47:9,67 --> 0:47:13,7
we're looking only at the transcripts that are going to go up.


770
0:47:13,7 --> 0:47:19,733
The plant has about 250 or so transcripts that are upregulated in a nodule.


771
0:47:19,733 --> 0:47:25,633
The bacterium has somewhat over 300 transcripts that increase.


772
0:47:25,633 --> 0:47:27,267
This is the wild type.


773
0:47:27,267 --> 0:47:29,0
Now, if we ask,


774
0:47:29,0 --> 0:47:31,167
what happens if we look at the transcripts


775
0:47:31,167 --> 0:47:35,333
made in a nodule that was created by the mutant?


776
0:47:35,333 --> 0:47:41,33
We see that a nodule made by the fixJ mutant


777
0:47:41,33 --> 0:47:44,367
upregulates very few transcripts.


778
0:47:44,367 --> 0:47:48,233
The vast majority of these 300-some transcripts that are


779
0:47:48,233 --> 0:47:52,167
increased in bacteria when they're wild-type


780
0:47:52,167 --> 0:47:56,867
apparently requires the FixJ system.


781
0:47:56,867 --> 0:48:1,467
So I would say from this that the bacterial transcription profile


782
0:48:1,467 --> 0:48:6,67
is responding to some signals right in time,


783
0:48:6,67 --> 0:48:9,733
at the point that nitrogen fixation is occurring.


784
0:48:9,733 --> 0:48:14,6
We found a contrasting result when we ask these same nodules


785
0:48:14,6 --> 0:48:17,1
that have so few bacterial transcripts,


786
0:48:17,1 --> 0:48:19,833
how many plant transcripts do they have?


787
0:48:19,833 --> 0:48:21,33
And that's shown here.


788
0:48:21,33 --> 0:48:25,533
What you can see is that almost all of the wild-type transcripts


789
0:48:25,533 --> 0:48:29,667
shown in this outer box are also made in the nodule


790
0:48:29,667 --> 0:48:35,9
that resulted from the bacteria that is mutated for nitrogen fixation.


791
0:48:35,9 --> 0:48:40,667
So I would say that suggests a couple of things.


792
0:48:40,667 --> 0:48:47,133
First, that the plant isn't making its decision about


793
0:48:47,133 --> 0:48:50,933
whether to transcribe these genes at the last minute.


794
0:48:50,933 --> 0:48:55,1
It made that decision to upregulate these genes early on,


795
0:48:55,1 --> 0:48:57,633
before the bacterium makes the decision about


796
0:48:57,633 --> 0:49:0,233
whether or not to fix nitrogen, right?


797
0:49:0,233 --> 0:49:3,267
So most of these genes, I would guess,


798
0:49:3,267 --> 0:49:6,667
are being made to build the nodule in the first place,


799
0:49:6,667 --> 0:49:11,267
that the strategy of the plant is to decide on the morphogenesis.


800
0:49:11,267 --> 0:49:14,233
But it also shows that, yes, there are some genes,


801
0:49:14,233 --> 0:49:16,4
and they're shown in this outer part that's not


802
0:49:16,4 --> 0:49:19,867
covered by the overlap,


803
0:49:19,867 --> 0:49:24,67
there are some genes that do depend on bacterial nitrogen fixation,


804
0:49:24,67 --> 0:49:25,867
in order for the plant to express them.


805
0:49:25,867 --> 0:49:27,967
So we want to find out in future studies


806
0:49:27,967 --> 0:49:32,167
how those are controlled, as well as how some


807
0:49:32,167 --> 0:49:37,567
of these are controlled irrespective of the bacterial signaling.


808
0:49:37,567 --> 0:49:41,5
And that brings me to the final topic,


809
0:49:41,5 --> 0:49:44,667
in which we've been able to use a combination of


810
0:49:44,667 --> 0:49:47,433
bacterial genetics and plant genetics,


811
0:49:47,433 --> 0:49:50,733
as a way of elucidating new signals.


812
0:49:50,733 --> 0:49:54,7
In a screen of plant mutants, we asked,


813
0:49:54,7 --> 0:50:0,9
can we find plant mutants that fail to accomplish nitrogen fixation,


814
0:50:0,9 --> 0:50:3,667
fail to accomplish correct symbiosis?


815
0:50:3,667 --> 0:50:7,2
Just as a baseline, let's take a look here at wild type.


816
0:50:7,2 --> 0:50:10,767
Now, in a wild-type plant with wild-type bacteria,


817
0:50:10,767 --> 0:50:13,767
you get nice nodules, here's those nodules.


818
0:50:13,767 --> 0:50:15,333
If you do a section through a nodule,


819
0:50:15,333 --> 0:50:19,133
you can see all of the infected cells.


820
0:50:19,133 --> 0:50:21,967
So here in the corner is the vasculature of the plant,


821
0:50:21,967 --> 0:50:23,767
so the root is going like this.


822
0:50:23,767 --> 0:50:26,567
Here's the nodule coming out and all of these dark-stained cells


823
0:50:26,567 --> 0:50:31,667
are packed full of successful bacteria fixing nitrogen.


824
0:50:31,667 --> 0:50:35,267
Using a bacterial strain that has a glucuronidase fusion


825
0:50:35,267 --> 0:50:38,633
in the nif genes, but is still wild-type,


826
0:50:38,633 --> 0:50:42,933
we're able to see that, if you take this kind of section of a nodule


827
0:50:42,933 --> 0:50:45,367
and you stain it for glucuronidase activity,


828
0:50:45,367 --> 0:50:49,2
you get this deep-blue stain, and that means that the nitrogen fixation


829
0:50:49,2 --> 0:50:51,7
genes are being transcribed.


830
0:50:51,7 --> 0:50:55,5
But now let's take a look at a plant mutant.


831
0:50:55,5 --> 0:50:57,933
So this plant mutant is called dnf,


832
0:50:57,933 --> 0:51:0,933
that stands for "defective in nitrogen fixation."


833
0:51:0,933 --> 0:51:7,167
If you see here, the bacterial action (wild-type bacteria)


834
0:51:7,167 --> 0:51:11,333
on this plant yield tiny, little, white nodules.


835
0:51:11,333 --> 0:51:15,267
They're not functioning, they're not fixing nitrogen.


836
0:51:15,267 --> 0:51:20,67
A look inside those nodules shows that the bacteria do get into cells.


837
0:51:20,67 --> 0:51:22,667
Here's the vasculature again, here's the root,


838
0:51:22,667 --> 0:51:24,167
here's the nodule.


839
0:51:24,167 --> 0:51:27,467
All these dark-staining cells are packed full of bacteria.


840
0:51:27,467 --> 0:51:32,567
However, if you put in the indicator for nif to glucuronidase


841
0:51:32,567 --> 0:51:35,0
and you stain for glucuronidase activity,


842
0:51:35,0 --> 0:51:38,333
you can see here that the nif genes (nitrogenase genes)


843
0:51:38,333 --> 0:51:42,367
are not being expressed. There's no blue stain.


844
0:51:42,367 --> 0:51:46,9
So something about this plant mutant


845
0:51:46,9 --> 0:51:49,667
is not allowing nitrogen fixation to occur.


846
0:51:49,667 --> 0:51:55,267
So we can say that the bacteria need whatever it is that DNF1 does


847
0:51:55,267 --> 0:51:58,7
in order to differentiate and fix nitrogen.


848
0:51:58,7 --> 0:52:4,833
Having carried out the crosses and mapping necessary,


849
0:52:4,833 --> 0:52:7,8
we have cloned and identified DNF1.


850
0:52:7,8 --> 0:52:12,567
We found that DNF1 encodes a plant protein


851
0:52:12,567 --> 0:52:16,3
that is a nodule-specific signal peptidase.


852
0:52:16,3 --> 0:52:20,533
Now, using this illustration from Molecular Biology of the Cell,


853
0:52:20,533 --> 0:52:23,5
I can just go through roughly what we would


854
0:52:23,5 --> 0:52:25,767
expect the signal peptidase to do doing.


855
0:52:25,767 --> 0:52:30,767
In the plant cytoplasm, you're going to have the endoplasmic reticulum.


856
0:52:30,767 --> 0:52:34,567
Some plant proteins are going to be encoded in the nucleus,


857
0:52:34,567 --> 0:52:37,2
they're going to be translated such that they go


858
0:52:37,2 --> 0:52:40,267
into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum,


859
0:52:40,267 --> 0:52:43,5
and that is made possible by a signal peptide.


860
0:52:43,5 --> 0:52:49,33
The signal peptidase cleaves off the signal peptide as so,


861
0:52:49,33 --> 0:52:54,9
releasing the mature polypeptide product.


862
0:52:54,9 --> 0:52:56,933
Now, what do those do?


863
0:52:56,933 --> 0:52:58,167
I'll get to that in a moment.


864
0:52:58,167 --> 0:53:3,367
But, what we just conclude is that there's going to be something


865
0:53:3,367 --> 0:53:9,233
about the action of DNF1 that's going to result


866
0:53:9,233 --> 0:53:15,0
in the production of a mature protein that might go to the cell wall,


867
0:53:15,0 --> 0:53:18,4
or it might go into vesicles.


868
0:53:18,4 --> 0:53:24,533
So whatever is being produced by the DNF1 signal peptidase


869
0:53:24,533 --> 0:53:32,0
may be purposed for secretion or for vesicle delivery.


870
0:53:32,0 --> 0:53:33,967
So what are the substrates?


871
0:53:33,967 --> 0:53:36,467
And here, our work was able to intersect


872
0:53:36,467 --> 0:53:38,967
with the work of Eva Kondorosi and Peter Mergaert


873
0:53:38,967 --> 0:53:40,7
and their colleagues.


874
0:53:40,7 --> 0:53:44,333
They had discovered a family of nodule-specific plant proteins


875
0:53:44,333 --> 0:53:50,667
that they called NCR, "nodule-specific cysteine-rich proteins."


876
0:53:50,667 --> 0:53:55,3
Using our mutant, they have been able to show that these NCR proteins


877
0:53:55,3 --> 0:54:0,933
are actually processed by our DNF1 signal peptidase.


878
0:54:0,933 --> 0:54:3,4
Therefore, what we can envision is that the lumen


879
0:54:3,4 --> 0:54:6,833
of the endoplasmic reticulum, as a donor compartment,


880
0:54:6,833 --> 0:54:14,33
is going to be full of these NCR peptides after they're processed.


881
0:54:14,33 --> 0:54:18,133
And these may be then delivered to a target compartment;


882
0:54:18,133 --> 0:54:21,467
we might envision that as having the Rhizobium.


883
0:54:21,467 --> 0:54:24,167
So, once again, what can consider here


884
0:54:24,167 --> 0:54:28,867
is that we've got NCR proteins from the plant


885
0:54:28,867 --> 0:54:35,0
being processed into the endoplasmic reticulum, put into vesicles,


886
0:54:35,0 --> 0:54:37,6
and then delivered into a compartment where


887
0:54:37,6 --> 0:54:40,4
they actually go into the Rhizobium and


888
0:54:40,4 --> 0:54:43,2
cause those Rhizobium to differentiate.


889
0:54:43,2 --> 0:54:46,133
This model can be tested in a number of ways,


890
0:54:46,133 --> 0:54:50,667
and those are underway at present.


891
0:54:50,667 --> 0:54:54,133
What we can envision though, is the following:


892
0:54:54,133 --> 0:54:57,767
We know that these bacterial cells,


893
0:54:57,767 --> 0:55:2,467
which are here shown in a closeup of an infected cell in a nodule,


894
0:55:2,467 --> 0:55:6,7
these bacterial cells must be getting a lot of signals from the plant.


895
0:55:6,7 --> 0:55:10,2
So if we envision this as a cartoon of a plant cell,


896
0:55:10,2 --> 0:55:13,67
and here's the cytoplasm of the plant cell,


897
0:55:13,67 --> 0:55:16,9
we already know from previous work that the leghemoglobin


898
0:55:16,9 --> 0:55:20,4
that I mentioned earlier, that gives the nodule its pink color,


899
0:55:20,4 --> 0:55:22,833
helps to buffer oxygen.


900
0:55:22,833 --> 0:55:26,5
It keeps free oxygen low while delivering it at a fast rate,


901
0:55:26,5 --> 0:55:29,633
and we know from earlier work that there's a signal transduction


902
0:55:29,633 --> 0:55:35,1
cascade that triggers the activity of NifA and


903
0:55:35,1 --> 0:55:40,0
eventual transcription of nitrogenase, due to the FixL/FixJ


904
0:55:40,0 --> 0:55:44,233
oxygen-sensitive two-component system.


905
0:55:44,233 --> 0:55:47,967
But now what we know is that something else is needed.


906
0:55:47,967 --> 0:55:53,33
Unless you've got DNF1 processing the NCRs


907
0:55:53,33 --> 0:55:55,67
and maybe doing other jobs as well,


908
0:55:55,67 --> 0:56:0,333
unless you've got DNF1, you still won't get nitrogen fixation.


909
0:56:0,333 --> 0:56:6,433
So, a completely new kind of process.


910
0:56:6,433 --> 0:56:10,4
Deep inside the nodule, there is a new signaling process


911
0:56:10,4 --> 0:56:12,867
going that we've now discovered.


912
0:56:12,867 --> 0:56:16,733
And this raises the possibility that specific


913
0:56:16,733 --> 0:56:23,267
DNF1-processed peptides may be triggering differentiation.


914
0:56:23,267 --> 0:56:25,467
As Mergaert and Kondorosi have shown,


915
0:56:25,467 --> 0:56:30,767
these peptides are also able to carry out control


916
0:56:30,767 --> 0:56:34,667
of bacterial cell division and DNA endoreduplication.


917
0:56:34,667 --> 0:56:37,467
So there are many hundreds of NCRs,


918
0:56:37,467 --> 0:56:39,367
and tracking down what each of them does


919
0:56:39,367 --> 0:56:41,5
is a big challenge for the future.


920
0:56:41,5 --> 0:56:44,867
From our standpoint, as we look at bacterial differentiation,


921
0:56:44,867 --> 0:56:49,33
we want to know, are these effects direct or indirect?


922
0:56:49,33 --> 0:56:53,567
Does an NCR peptide actually go into the bacterium


923
0:56:53,567 --> 0:56:56,833
and interact with a receptor, or is it causing some condition


924
0:56:56,833 --> 0:57:0,767
in the plant that then causes gene transcription


925
0:57:0,767 --> 0:57:2,633
to change in the bacterium?


926
0:57:2,633 --> 0:57:6,9
So, our purpose is right now to characterize the mechanism


927
0:57:6,9 --> 0:57:12,867
in the plant of how these DNF1 signal peptidase components


928
0:57:12,867 --> 0:57:15,933
are working to ask whether there are other substrate


929
0:57:15,933 --> 0:57:20,433
proteins as well, and to find out their mechanism in symbiosis.


930
0:57:20,433 --> 0:57:23,133
So what I've shown you today is an outline of how


931
0:57:23,133 --> 0:57:26,367
we're taking a look at bacterial genes from the early


932
0:57:26,367 --> 0:57:29,867
nodulation processes all the way through the differentiation


933
0:57:29,867 --> 0:57:34,3
of the bacteria that makes it possible for them to fix nitrogen.


934
0:57:34,3 --> 0:57:40,2
And I think in particular that the use of plant mutants,


935
0:57:40,2 --> 0:57:44,367
as we did with DNF1, to look for plant factors


936
0:57:44,367 --> 0:57:46,8
that control bacteria may be an especially promising


937
0:57:46,8 --> 0:57:49,833
direction for the future.


938
0:57:49,833 --> 0:57:52,1
They're going to be many levels of regulation,


939
0:57:52,1 --> 0:57:55,67
from external signals to sigma factors.


940
0:57:55,67 --> 0:57:59,7
I think that the combination of genetics and in vitro transcription


941
0:57:59,7 --> 0:58:1,867
studies are important.


942
0:58:1,867 --> 0:58:5,733
And a lot of our effort in the future is going to be directed towards


943
0:58:5,733 --> 0:58:10,367
this double study of plant mutants and bacterial genes,


944
0:58:10,367 --> 0:58:14,233
in order to try to dissect out the signals and controls.


945
0:58:14,233 --> 0:58:17,67
So with that, I'll conclude this part of the lecture,


946
0:58:17,67 --> 0:58:20,8
and my third lecture is going to be on how the plant responds


947
0:58:20,8 --> 0:58:25,667
to the bacterial signals at the various stages of nodulation.


948
0:58:25,667 --> 0:60:25,667
Thank you.
