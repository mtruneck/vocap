###0 
###8 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, definitely.
###10 We both want to get high.
###12 Betel nut, bing lang, is an amphetamine you get up.
###15 It's tingly.
###16 I remember the first time I ate chewing tobacco, I drank a
###20 half bottle of Stoli and then puked all over this chick on
###23 family day at the University of Pittsburgh.
###26 So I hope this doesn't end the same way.
###30 
###55 -Eddie Huang.
###56 
###59 DAVID: They lost our tripod, so we might have to
###62 rent one out here.
###63 EDDIE HUANG: We haven't been here an hour and the dude
###65 already got jacked.
###66 It's not looking good.
###68 This dude's doing calisthenics with a strap-on.
###71 
###85 OK, George, I will tell you when we see a good one.
###87 All right, pull up, George, I'm going to open my door.
###90 
###92 Hello, hallelujah, holla back, women like a bing lang.
###96 -Bing lang.
###97 EDDIE HUANG: Good.
###98 Uh-huh.
###99 Yes.
###101 The most famous Taiwan marketing retail shit is betel
###105 nut beauties, all right?
###108 Betel nut is a very popular amphetamine and it's like a
###112 kind of chewing tobacco, but it gets you really up.
###115 It's very popular all throughout Asia, but Taiwan is
###117 famous for betel nut beauties.
###119 And I mean, we don't really have a beauty here.
###122 This one clearly has seen better days, b.
###127 So they take rice wine and they put other things, like
###130 amphetamines that'll get you up, get you excited, and
###134 everybody has their own little mixture.
###136 And the trick with the betel nut is, you've got to, just
###139 like this, bite the top off.
###142 You want to chew, and you want to spit out the first, right?
###145 Just like you're cooking.
###146 Throw out the first.
###147 And then you just chew it.
###148 It's like chewing tobacco.
###150 It kinda just gets you zooming.
###152 I try not to do it too much because, as you can see,
###155 George, come here, smile George.
###157 See?
###158 Before, after.
###160 [LAUGH]
###164 I'm a kidnap her, feed her to my mattress.
###166 Thank you.
###167 [SPEAKING CHINESE].
###168 -Bye-bye.
###168 EDDIE HUANG: Bye-bye.
###170 
###176 Wait, didn't we already cop from this shorty?
###178 
###181 Oh watch out, be careful, be careful.
###184 They will run you over, b.
###185 This is one of many night markets in Taiwan, but Shilin
###190 is definitely the most famous.
###192 Yo, this is the always imitated, never duplicated Hot
###195 Star large fried chicken, all right?
###198 You'll see they put a little seasoning on here.
###200 There's chili powder, there's a little five spice, salt and
###203 sugar, here we go.
###205 Listen.
###206 Listen to this sound.
###206 It's Like Rice Krispies.
###209 Super crispy and they're real juicy, bursting, with juice,
###214 and then that seasoning--
###215 you just smell it, it's crazy.
###218 Hot Star.
###219 
###222 So this is a sausage stuffed with sticky rice.
###227 Sometimes they'll put shiitake mushrooms, some shallots, and
###230 he's wiping it with a sweet soy then he just came with
###233 some pickled radish over there.
###235 Then there's some more pickled [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###238 that we had earlier today.
###239 [BURP]
###239 Excuse me.
###240 Cucumbers shredded, and then a Taiwanese red sausage.
###244 Sausage in a sausage.
###248 It's like eating a sausage with a sticky rice condom on.
###252 And you enjoy it a lot more than you would think.
###254 
###261 EDDIE HUANG: Ice.
###262 GEORGE: Ice.
###264 EDDIE HUANG: Penis ice.
###265 Penis ice.
###266 You like to put it in your mouth.
###269 [LAUGH]
###272 I'd say top five most popular Taiwanese night market foods,
###275 this called a [SPEAKING CHINESE].
###276 They use the funkiness of the bamboo, the essence of the
###279 pork, some shiitake mushrooms, some shallots, and they'll
###283 make a ground meat mixture.
###287 In that big mixing bowl is the starch mixture.
###290 Then they'll put the filling in.
###291 Once it's filled, it's shaped.
###293 Once it's shaped, it goes here and steamed, then topped with
###297 the sauce over there.
###298 Sometimes people do a little sweet chili too.
###300 The thing about Asian food that always bugs Westerners
###303 out-- savory foods with a gelatinous texture.
###306 This is probably like the boogieman food to an American
###309 and Western palate.
###310 But I love this.
###311 And it's the quintessential Taiwanese flavor.
###313 
###321 Yo, mega pause.
###325 Giant waffle dills.
###327 You can give to your friends.
###328 And you can scare your friends.
###330 And you can take it to the party.
###331 And you will be the focus of the party because you brought
###334 a box, a $10 box, of penis waffles.
###338 What better present to, like, a baby shower?
###342 Hey ma, what's really good?
###346 We've got the Plaxico Burress here.
###348 We've got the Dhani Jones.
###350 We've got the Victor Cruz.
###352 We've got the Lawrence Tynes.
###354 We've got the Eli Manning.
###355 Yo, look at shorty here.
###357 How could you get yourself caught wide open like this?
###361 Who volunteers themselves for these photos?
###363 Oh my god, this is the Lexington Steele chocolate
###368 crazy crispy dills.
###370 Oh my god.
###372 [LAUGH]
###374 I'm not eating this because you would have to lick this.
###377 You would have to suck this.
###379 -Ice dicks?
###380 EDDIE HUANG: No!
###380 [LAUGH]
###387 Oh.
###387 DAVID: Eddie look, though, check it out.
###389 Check it out.
###389 There's nuts in the nuts.
###393 EDDIE HUANG: I can't do it, dude.
###394 DAVID: You can't do it.
###395 EDDIE HUANG: I can't.
###395 DAVID: You can't?
###396 EDDIE HUANG: My grandpa would be so disappointed.
###398 Who is this?
###400 Who is this?
###401 DAVID: [LAUGH]
###403 EDDIE HUANG: Yo, wait, you put it in your mouth.
###406 We've got the handcuffs on you, Alcatraz.
###410 Here, hey, G's up, frozen dills down.
###415 [LAUGH]
###417 Only in Taiwan will you find a penis waffle
###421 stand with the tagline--
###424 a piece of [FOREIGN LANGUAGE].
###425 I don't know what else to say about Taiwan.
###428 I don't know what to say about the night market.
###430 I think this dick in a box that says it all.
###433 Fresh off the Boat, one chain, two dills.
###437 I'm Eddie Huang, we out.
###441 What just happened, b?
###442 Why is everybody looking at me?
###445 Is there some shit on my face?
###449 So yo, it's like after midnight.
###452 You wasted.
###453 You just came out of the club.
###454 You didn't catch any tang.
###457 So where would you and your homies go?
###458 Not the bar.
###460 Not nobody's crib to do some blow.
###462 We at the hottest spot in fucking Taiwan--
###464 24-hour motherfucking shrimp city, b.
###468 Let's go.
###469 
###477 You've got a little Whack-a-Mole, Jigpa.
###479 You've got some Hot Shot.
###480 A peep game over here.
###483 Grab a beer, go shrimping, all right?
###489 This could be like the Soho House except, instead of
###492 shorties in the pool, you've got shrimps.
###496 Got 'em.
###499 It was the one-armed man.
###501 -[SPEAKING CHINESE]
###502 EDDIE HUANG: Oh, man.
###503 
###506 Dude, that shrimp squirted me.
###509 In the world of sport fishing, this is like shrimp hookers.
###514 You pay to play.
###515 There's no game.
###516 You put your fucking dick in the water.
###518 You catch skrimps.
###521 Chef, how many more minutes?
###523 
###526 Chef says we can eat it.
###529 I'm just curious if this is a good look, to be eating shrimp
###532 out of that pool.
###533 It's kind of like the baths that I used to catch in golf
###537 course ponds.
###539 Ooh, look at that.
###540 
###545 So you look around at this fucking 24-hour shrimp club--
###548 a lot of long faces, a couple of SARS masks, a
###552 lot of single dudes.
###555 There's one shorty.
###557 This has got to be one of the most depressing places to
###560 spend an evening.
###561 When we're not here people probably put their
###563 feet in this shit.
###564 It smells like a hot spring.
###566 I have no idea what's-- this water is mother fucking green,
###569 and there's no vegetation.
###571 You really, probably, should not be eating these skrimps.
###574 I feel like this for show and for sport, but then there's
###577 not much sport to it, either.
###579 And on that note, we motherfucking out.
###583 Fresh off the Boat with Eddie Huang, Taiwan.
###585 Peace.
###587 -On the next episode of Fresh off the Boat.
