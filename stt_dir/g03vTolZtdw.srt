[RADIO STATIC]


2
0:0:8,8 --> 0:0:9,76
MITT ROMNEY: I think marijuana
should not be


3
0:0:9,76 --> 0:0:10,62
legal in this country.


4
0:0:10,62 --> 0:0:15,37
I believe it's a gateway drug
to other drug violations.


5
0:0:15,37 --> 0:0:18,85
The use of the illegal drugs in
this country is leading to


6
0:0:18,85 --> 0:0:20,1
terrible consequences.


7
0:0:20,1 --> 0:0:24,18



8
0:0:24,18 --> 0:0:26,48
SHANE SMITH: Now we all know
Mitt Romney's stance on drugs,


9
0:0:26,48 --> 0:0:28,53
but it was interesting to hear
Kelly's thoughts on the drug


10
0:0:28,53 --> 0:0:31,88
war, considering it affects
him every day.


11
0:0:31,88 --> 0:0:34,28
KELLY ROMNEY: To me, this used
to be the most peaceful place


12
0:0:34,28 --> 0:0:35,65
in the world.


13
0:0:35,65 --> 0:0:39,52
I used let my kids go to
[SPANISH], go to the shows, go


14
0:0:39,52 --> 0:0:41,22
to dances, go to parties.


15
0:0:41,22 --> 0:0:44,13
But now you keep
a close watch.


16
0:0:44,13 --> 0:0:46,3
And it all has to
do with the drug


17
0:0:46,3 --> 0:0:47,57
violence that has started.


18
0:0:47,57 --> 0:0:51,48
When they started the
war on drugs, the


19
0:0:51,48 --> 0:0:53,76
violence just escalated.


20
0:0:53,76 --> 0:0:55,7
Most of the problems
that we have around


21
0:0:55,7 --> 0:0:57,49
here are drug related.


22
0:0:57,49 --> 0:1:0,82
And there's been some
kidnappings and some killings


23
0:1:0,82 --> 0:1:3,32
from drug related things.


24
0:1:3,32 --> 0:1:6,65
SHANE SMITH: Have there ever
been any Romneys kidnapped?


25
0:1:6,65 --> 0:1:8,73
KELLY ROMNEY: Yeah, my brother
was kidnapped three


26
0:1:8,73 --> 0:1:10,23
years ago in May.


27
0:1:10,23 --> 0:1:13,36
I think they kept him for two
days, took him to a cave up in


28
0:1:13,36 --> 0:1:14,62
the mountains.


29
0:1:14,62 --> 0:1:15,49
We paid a small ransom.


30
0:1:15,49 --> 0:1:16,51
It wasn't a lot.


31
0:1:16,51 --> 0:1:18,3
They were mainly punks.


32
0:1:18,3 --> 0:1:20,5
They weren't really
professionals.


33
0:1:20,5 --> 0:1:23,59
SHANE SMITH: And most of the
weapons that are here in


34
0:1:23,59 --> 0:1:25,59
Mexico are illegal weapons.


35
0:1:25,59 --> 0:1:27,61
And most of those illegal
weapons are


36
0:1:27,61 --> 0:1:28,99
coming from the states.


37
0:1:28,99 --> 0:1:29,61
KELLY ROMNEY: Yes.


38
0:1:29,61 --> 0:1:32,47
Fast and Furious, I'm sure
you've heard about that?


39
0:1:32,47 --> 0:1:35,19
SHANE SMITH: Now, the Fast and
the Furious scandal he's


40
0:1:35,19 --> 0:1:38,27
talking about refers to a case
where the American government


41
0:1:38,27 --> 0:1:40,82
gave thousands of guns
to the cartels in


42
0:1:40,82 --> 0:1:42,7
order to track them.


43
0:1:42,7 --> 0:1:44,7
Then they proceeded to lose
track of them until they


44
0:1:44,7 --> 0:1:48,38
surfaced again in the murder
cases of American agents.


45
0:1:48,38 --> 0:1:49,67
KELLY ROMNEY: What, they think
that we're going to be able to


46
0:1:49,67 --> 0:1:51,98
keep control of them or
keep track of them?


47
0:1:51,98 --> 0:1:52,89
Nonsense.


48
0:1:52,89 --> 0:1:55,89
I don't know what in the world
they were thinking sending all


49
0:1:55,89 --> 0:1:58,71
those weapons to Mexico.


50
0:1:58,71 --> 0:2:0,62
SHANE SMITH: And the Fast and
the Furious scandal is just


51
0:2:0,62 --> 0:2:2,87
one of many that have seriously
embarrassed the


52
0:2:2,87 --> 0:2:4,12
American government.


53
0:2:4,12 --> 0:2:7,71
Now, perhaps, Mitt's hard line
stance on issues like guns,


54
0:2:7,71 --> 0:2:10,669
immigration, and drugs
becomes more clear.


55
0:2:10,669 --> 0:2:13,4
Because even though his father
was born in Chihuahua, Mitt


56
0:2:13,4 --> 0:2:15,68
surely must want to distance
himself from the region,


57
0:2:15,68 --> 0:2:18,76
because the region is
totally fucked up.


58
0:2:18,76 --> 0:2:21,19
And it's not the first time
this has been the Romney


59
0:2:21,19 --> 0:2:22,26
strategy, either.


60
0:2:22,26 --> 0:2:24,31
When his father ran for
president, both his


61
0:2:24,31 --> 0:2:27,68
citizenship and his Mormon
colony's polygamist roots were


62
0:2:27,68 --> 0:2:29,16
called into question.


63
0:2:29,16 --> 0:2:32,5
And his run for the White House
didn't last too long.


64
0:2:32,5 --> 0:2:35,24
But Mitt Romney has to deal with
his family's polygamist


65
0:2:35,24 --> 0:2:39,96
past, kidnapping, drug wars,
and in the extreme case of


66
0:2:39,96 --> 0:2:43,66
Ervil LeBaron, crazy Mormon
blood atonement.


67
0:2:43,66 --> 0:2:46,74
Now, having close familial ties
to all of this shit does


68
0:2:46,74 --> 0:2:48,66
not a good presidential
candidate make.


69
0:2:48,66 --> 0:2:51,99



70
0:2:51,99 --> 0:2:54,89
Being on the front lines of
this, what do you think are


71
0:2:54,89 --> 0:2:56,58
some of solutions to
these problems?


72
0:2:56,58 --> 0:2:58,56
KELLY ROMNEY: Looking at it from
a perspective of someone


73
0:2:58,56 --> 0:3:1,49
living here, we say, well, why
don't they legalize it in the


74
0:3:1,49 --> 0:3:3,57
United States and cut out all
of violence in Mexico?


75
0:3:3,57 --> 0:3:5,96
SHANE SMITH: Sure.


76
0:3:5,96 --> 0:3:7,75
KELLY ROMNEY: As long as you
have the swimming pool over


77
0:3:7,75 --> 0:3:9,73
there, this is going to
be the diving board.


78
0:3:9,73 --> 0:3:15,8



79
0:3:15,8 --> 0:3:17,49
SHANE SMITH: So as we began
our long drive back to the


80
0:3:17,49 --> 0:3:19,6
border, I had lots of time
to think about what


81
0:3:19,6 --> 0:3:21,35
we'd seen in Chihuahua.


82
0:3:21,35 --> 0:3:23,27
I thought about the LeBarons
and the war against the


83
0:3:23,27 --> 0:3:26,57
narcos, the kidnapping and
murders, and the length they


84
0:3:26,57 --> 0:3:29,79
have to go to protect themselves
every day.


85
0:3:29,79 --> 0:3:32,21
I also thought about what Kelly
Romney had said about


86
0:3:32,21 --> 0:3:34,54
the US being the swimming pool
and Mexico being the diving


87
0:3:34,54 --> 0:3:38,31
board, and how similar all this
is to America's history


88
0:3:38,31 --> 0:3:39,56
with outlawing alcohol.


89
0:3:39,56 --> 0:3:43,11



90
0:3:43,11 --> 0:3:46,65
So we're just approaching the
border here back into America.


91
0:3:46,65 --> 0:3:50,7
Feels like about a year has
passed since were here last.


92
0:3:50,7 --> 0:3:54,18
As we were driving here from
Chihuahua, I was thinking how


93
0:3:54,18 --> 0:3:56,565
prohibition in America led to
the rise of the mob, the Al


94
0:3:56,565 --> 0:3:58,86
Capones, the Lucky Lucianos.


95
0:3:58,86 --> 0:4:1,64
Our war on drugs, our
prohibition against drugs, has


96
0:4:1,64 --> 0:4:2,57
caused the same thing.


97
0:4:2,57 --> 0:4:3,78
You see it down here.


98
0:4:3,78 --> 0:4:5,36
It's the blunt end
of the hammer.


99
0:4:5,36 --> 0:4:6,59
It's rule of the thug.


100
0:4:6,59 --> 0:4:8,35
You have $200 assassins.


101
0:4:8,35 --> 0:4:9,955
And as long as there's
prohibition,


102
0:4:9,955 --> 0:4:11,47
it's going to continue.


103
0:4:11,47 --> 0:4:13,31
The war on drugs is a failure.


104
0:4:13,31 --> 0:4:14,93
There have never been more drugs
in America and they've


105
0:4:14,93 --> 0:4:18,79
never been cheaper or better
or higher quality.


106
0:4:18,79 --> 0:4:20,39
And as we sat for hours at the
border, waiting to get back


107
0:4:20,39 --> 0:4:23,37
into America, I thought about
the fact that Mitt Romney


108
0:4:23,37 --> 0:4:24,78
might just be the
next president


109
0:4:24,78 --> 0:4:25,94
of the United States.


110
0:4:25,94 --> 0:4:27,46
MITT ROMNEY: God
bless America.


111
0:4:27,46 --> 0:4:28,435
Thank you guys.


112
0:4:28,435 --> 0:4:31,24
SHANE SMITH: Now, polygamy and
kidnapping not withstanding,


113
0:4:31,24 --> 0:4:34,67
if he wins, he's going to have
some hard decisions to make


114
0:4:34,67 --> 0:4:36,79
about decriminalizing
drugs and fixing


115
0:4:36,79 --> 0:4:38,8
our immigration problem.


116
0:4:38,8 --> 0:4:41,85
Because if he doesn't, Mexico,
his Mormon brethren, and


117
0:4:41,85 --> 0:4:44,21
perhaps even his own
flesh and blood are


118
0:4:44,21 --> 0:4:44,99
going to pay the price.


119
0:4:44,99 --> 0:6:44,99
