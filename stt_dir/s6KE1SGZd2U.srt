1
0:0:2,287 --> 0:0:4,807
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>I came to watch Turk</i>


2
0:0:4,807 --> 0:0:7,7
<i>when I could've been asleep,</i>


3
0:0:7,7 --> 0:0:9,527
<i>I guess I haven't seen</i>
<i>much of him lately,</i>


4
0:0:9,527 --> 0:0:16,287
<i>It's not like I'm desperate,</i>


5
0:0:16,287 --> 0:0:19,247
What makes you think you know better?


6
0:0:19,247 --> 0:0:24,287
- ln my gut l know l'm right.
- We need this decision now.


7
0:0:24,287 --> 0:0:26,887
- Fine, then it's on you.
- Yes, it is.


8
0:0:26,887 --> 0:0:28,567
Nurse.


9
0:0:28,567 --> 0:0:48,327
- Erasure.
- Yes, doctor.


10
0:0:48,327 --> 0:0:51,447
l hate this song.


11
0:0:51,447 --> 0:1:11,167
Me too, man.


12
0:1:11,167 --> 0:1:15,7
<i>A hospital room can be</i>
<i>kind of a romantic place,</i>


13
0:1:15,7 --> 0:1:17,687
<i>Maybe it's the soft green glow</i>
<i>of a heart monitor</i>


14
0:1:17,687 --> 0:1:20,407
<i>or the way the moonlight</i>
<i>reflects off a bedpan,</i>


15
0:1:20,407 --> 0:1:23,527
Our shifts keep overlapping
on Friday nights.


16
0:1:23,527 --> 0:1:26,87
Closest thing
l've had to a date recently.


17
0:1:26,87 --> 0:1:28,447
Well, l had
a great time tonight.


18
0:1:28,447 --> 0:1:30,607
Oh, yeah. Me too.


19
0:1:30,607 --> 0:1:35,47
- So, can l page you?
- Don't do the two-day waiting thing.


20
0:1:35,47 --> 0:1:37,87
Oh, baby,
l don't play by the rules.


21
0:1:37,87 --> 0:1:39,447
So, goodnight.


22
0:1:39,447 --> 0:1:47,967
<i>Wait, Is she joking?</i>
<i>If she's joking and I kiss her,,,</i>


23
0:1:47,967 --> 0:2:3,927
<i>Of course</i>
<i>if she's not joking,,,</i>


24
0:2:3,927 --> 0:2:6,247
l don't do this
for all the doctors.


25
0:2:6,247 --> 0:2:9,967
<i>Yes!</i>


26
0:2:9,967 --> 0:2:12,687
He's gonna need 40mEqs of KCL.


27
0:2:12,687 --> 0:2:14,927
Grab me when you get the results.


28
0:2:14,927 --> 0:2:16,687
You got it.


29
0:2:16,687 --> 0:2:20,847
His TV is broken, so when you
two start tagging each other,


30
0:2:20,847 --> 0:2:24,527
the least you can do is
wake him up and let him watch.


31
0:2:24,527 --> 0:2:27,967
<i>In my experience when two friends</i>
<i>miss a chance like this</i>


32
0:2:27,967 --> 0:2:30,607
<i>you've got exactly 48 hours</i>
<i>to get the kiss,</i>


33
0:2:30,607 --> 0:2:34,327
<i>Or one of you will over-think it,</i>
<i>OK she's gonna over-think it,</i>


34
0:2:34,327 --> 0:2:38,727
<i>Then you end up permanently</i>
<i>stuck in the Friend Zone,</i>


35
0:2:38,727 --> 0:2:41,607
l'll see ya.


36
0:2:41,607 --> 0:2:46,87
You're such a girl.


37
0:2:46,87 --> 0:2:48,647
Nothing went on between me and Elliot.


38
0:2:48,647 --> 0:2:50,967
Good thing you still
have your flower.


39
0:2:50,967 --> 0:2:53,647
That song is like a virus.


40
0:2:53,647 --> 0:2:55,447
l'm just a little lonely.


41
0:2:55,447 --> 0:2:59,207
l haven't been hanging out with Turk
since he's been dating Carla.


42
0:2:59,207 --> 0:3:1,167
First of all, who's Turk?


43
0:3:1,167 --> 0:3:4,487
And don't answer.
Look, if you have a medical question,


44
0:3:4,487 --> 0:3:7,247
l'm forced by hospital policy
to answer you.


45
0:3:7,247 --> 0:3:10,327
However, if you ask me
about a personal problem,


46
0:3:10,327 --> 0:3:16,527
l'm going to start doing this.


47
0:3:16,527 --> 0:3:18,767
You seem unhappy.


48
0:3:18,767 --> 0:3:31,447
l like that.


49
0:3:31,447 --> 0:3:34,847
l cannot get that stupid song
out of my head.


50
0:3:34,847 --> 0:3:38,447
lt's like a damn virus.
Here's his chart, his transfer note.


51
0:3:38,447 --> 0:3:42,127
He's haemodynamically stable.
Consider him turfed to medicine.


52
0:3:42,127 --> 0:3:45,887
T-Man. l'm gonna get my grub on.


53
0:3:45,887 --> 0:3:49,167
Means he's gonna go eat.


54
0:3:49,167 --> 0:3:53,887
- Surgery went OK?
- lt was cool.


55
0:3:53,887 --> 0:3:58,247
Dude, l got to close
for the first time ever. Ever.


56
0:3:58,247 --> 0:4:1,447
The human body is so disgusting.


57
0:4:1,447 --> 0:4:3,687
Not yours. Yours is stunning.


58
0:4:3,687 --> 0:4:7,727
We should celebrate. Tear it up
like we used to, just the two of us.


59
0:4:7,727 --> 0:4:11,967
- What comes before Part B?
- Part A!


60
0:4:11,967 --> 0:4:16,447
That's right, we used to tear it up.


61
0:4:16,447 --> 0:4:21,487
We should probably
never do that again.


62
0:4:21,487 --> 0:4:35,7
<i>That song is like a virus,</i>


63
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:36,247
No!


64
0:4:36,247 --> 0:4:37,687
<i>Don't let it be awkward,</i>


65
0:4:37,687 --> 0:4:39,87
<i>Do something cute,</i>


66
0:4:39,87 --> 0:4:43,847
<i>Cover her eyes</i>
<i>and say ''Guess who?''</i>


67
0:4:43,847 --> 0:4:46,7
- Guess who?
- l can't breathe.


68
0:4:46,7 --> 0:4:49,487
OK, gang, it's time for rounds.


69
0:4:49,487 --> 0:4:56,847
Let's see who's
<i>The Weakest Link,</i>


70
0:4:56,847 --> 0:5:0,847
The Weakest Link!


71
0:5:0,847 --> 0:5:5,367
Now, then, Dr Simotas.


72
0:5:5,367 --> 0:5:9,727
Severe swelling of the lips in this
patient might be an indication of what?


73
0:5:9,727 --> 0:5:12,607
- Angio-oedema.
- Well done, sport.


74
0:5:12,607 --> 0:5:16,207
And what treatment would you
recommend, Dr Dorian?


75
0:5:16,207 --> 0:5:19,527
A combination of steroids
and antihistamines.


76
0:5:19,527 --> 0:5:22,87
Attaboy, sport.


77
0:5:22,87 --> 0:5:25,167
What would you recommend
the patient stay away from,


78
0:5:25,167 --> 0:5:27,687
Dr Reid?


79
0:5:27,687 --> 0:5:32,247
- My first guess would be shellfish.
- Right you are, sweetheart.


80
0:5:32,247 --> 0:5:33,327
Sweetheart?


81
0:5:33,327 --> 0:5:36,967
<i>I could see what was going on</i>
<i>in Elliot's head,</i>


82
0:5:36,967 --> 0:5:47,727
Right you are, sweetheart.


83
0:5:47,727 --> 0:5:50,527
- What do you want to watch?
- <i>Fletch,</i>


84
0:5:50,527 --> 0:5:52,527
- <i>Fletch</i> it is.
- Seen it.


85
0:5:52,527 --> 0:5:55,607
You haven't seen it with us
saying all the lines.


86
0:5:55,607 --> 0:5:58,327
l'm so lucky l met you.


87
0:5:58,327 --> 0:6:0,487
Maybe next time
her mom could come.


88
0:6:0,487 --> 0:6:2,927
You won't even know she's here.


89
0:6:2,927 --> 0:6:6,487
Except she laughs at stupid stuff
and that makes me laugh.


90
0:6:6,487 --> 0:6:10,727
lt's stupid because it's so stupid.


91
0:6:10,727 --> 0:6:14,287
- Tonight's still about us.
- Whatever, l don't care.


92
0:6:14,287 --> 0:6:21,327
Turk, you wanna go hang out
in your room?


93
0:6:21,327 --> 0:6:24,247
l know Dr Kelso
doesn't mean anything by it,


94
0:6:24,247 --> 0:6:26,607
and OK, maybe l am
kind of a sweetheart.


95
0:6:26,607 --> 0:6:29,727
- l'm sleeping.
- But it just sounds so demeaning.


96
0:6:29,727 --> 0:6:32,527
You're not listening
to a word l'm saying.


97
0:6:32,527 --> 0:6:35,367
lt's not like
he's my grandpa or anything.


98
0:6:35,367 --> 0:6:38,527
Anyway, JD always tells me
how much you've helped him.


99
0:6:38,527 --> 0:6:41,967
He obviously hasn't told you
about my ear-flicking policy.


100
0:6:41,967 --> 0:6:45,287
This whole groovy
guidance counsellor thing


101
0:6:45,287 --> 0:6:48,687
you people seem to have working
is a total fantasy.


102
0:6:48,687 --> 0:6:51,247
l'm not that guy.
You can go and ask anybody.


103
0:6:51,247 --> 0:6:56,647
Now, you've got to leave me
alone or l'll punish you.


104
0:6:56,647 --> 0:6:59,647
Sweetheart is kind of innocuous.


105
0:6:59,647 --> 0:7:3,327
Here's what you're gonna do.
Go down there and confront Kelso.


106
0:7:3,327 --> 0:7:4,887
- Really?
- Absolutely.


107
0:7:4,887 --> 0:7:8,287
Never mind
that he is the Chief of Medicine,


108
0:7:8,287 --> 0:7:11,87
he'll have a whole new level
of respect for you.


109
0:7:11,87 --> 0:7:12,647
- Honestly?
- Yes.


110
0:7:12,647 --> 0:7:22,327
You can't have sexist terms
like that around here. You go get 'im.


111
0:7:22,327 --> 0:7:25,287
This guy looks stable
but l still wanna get an EKG.


112
0:7:25,287 --> 0:7:27,87
Let's do cardiac enzymes...


113
0:7:27,87 --> 0:7:29,7
When you say sweetheart...


114
0:7:29,7 --> 0:7:31,167
...and an aspirin.


115
0:7:31,167 --> 0:7:33,647
<i>A lot of my work</i>
<i>has become second nature,</i>


116
0:7:33,647 --> 0:7:36,207
<i>But it gives me too much time to think,</i>


117
0:7:36,207 --> 0:7:39,7
Look, l'm surgery and you're medicine.


118
0:7:39,7 --> 0:7:42,687
This isn't college any more.
Things have to change.


119
0:7:42,687 --> 0:7:47,567
l know relationships change, l guess
l thought yours and mine never would.


120
0:7:47,567 --> 0:7:51,407
- What's going on with you, man?
- We used to look out for each other.


121
0:7:51,407 --> 0:7:53,567
l don't feel you have my back any more.


122
0:7:53,567 --> 0:7:56,927
- You really feel that way?
- Yeah, l do.


123
0:7:56,927 --> 0:7:59,207
You do? Great.


124
0:7:59,207 --> 0:8:2,687
l'll get them from my locker,
you can write me a cheque.


125
0:8:2,687 --> 0:8:7,647
Can you look at Mr Bidwell?
His temperature's starting to spike.


126
0:8:7,647 --> 0:8:9,287
Sure.


127
0:8:9,287 --> 0:8:11,367
Legally, there's a huge difference.


128
0:8:11,367 --> 0:8:14,807
Stitch a patient, sew a sheet to him,
that's an accident.


129
0:8:14,807 --> 0:8:18,407
He tries getting up, gurney collapses,
breaks his front teeth,


130
0:8:18,407 --> 0:8:19,687
that's a lawsuit.


131
0:8:19,687 --> 0:8:22,487
Say it with me.
Accident. Lawsuit.


132
0:8:22,487 --> 0:8:24,127
Accident. Lawsuit.


133
0:8:24,127 --> 0:8:26,927
So, what is it, sweetheart?


134
0:8:26,927 --> 0:8:29,847
lt's the sweetheart thing.
lt doesn't hit me right.


135
0:8:29,847 --> 0:8:32,887
l'm a doctor,
it seems sort of disrespectful.


136
0:8:32,887 --> 0:8:36,487
l've always called men ''sport''
and ladies ''sweetheart''.


137
0:8:36,487 --> 0:8:42,87
But you call Becky ''sport''.


138
0:8:42,87 --> 0:8:46,807
Well, l am so sorry, sport.


139
0:8:46,807 --> 0:8:49,527
lt's one of those bad habits
l've developed


140
0:8:49,527 --> 0:8:52,967
after working in the medical field
for over 30 years.


141
0:8:52,967 --> 0:8:59,527
30 years? But you look so young!


142
0:8:59,527 --> 0:9:2,847
<i>It's hard to see a patient</i>
<i>get worse instead of better,</i>


143
0:9:2,847 --> 0:9:5,927
<i>That's kind of the opposite</i>
<i>of what we're going for,</i>


144
0:9:5,927 --> 0:9:8,47
He was fine last night.


145
0:9:8,47 --> 0:9:11,927
Now he's diaphoretic, in and out
of consciousness, maybe septic.


146
0:9:11,927 --> 0:9:14,367
We won't know till
his blood work's back.


147
0:9:14,367 --> 0:9:17,327
<i>If he's septic they might</i>
<i>have to re-open this guy,</i>


148
0:9:17,327 --> 0:9:20,87
<i>Course there's also</i>
<i>a chance he could die,</i>


149
0:9:20,87 --> 0:9:22,807
l've seen this before.
Gauze, sponges,


150
0:9:22,807 --> 0:9:25,607
some young surgeon
left something in this man.


151
0:9:25,607 --> 0:9:30,127
No, l know the guy that closed.
He'd never be that careless.


152
0:9:30,127 --> 0:9:32,167
Excuse me, sorry.


153
0:9:32,167 --> 0:9:34,87
Has anyone seen my keys?


154
0:9:34,87 --> 0:9:37,127
No? How about my wallet?


155
0:9:37,127 --> 0:9:40,727
Anyone?


156
0:9:40,727 --> 0:10:0,967
l've never seen that before.


157
0:10:0,967 --> 0:10:2,247
Turk!


158
0:10:2,247 --> 0:10:16,687
Dr Cox, have you seen Turk?


159
0:10:16,687 --> 0:10:19,167
Turk.


160
0:10:19,167 --> 0:10:22,727
l was just dreaming about you.


161
0:10:22,727 --> 0:10:26,47
You were... Well, we were...


162
0:10:26,47 --> 0:10:29,847
You got a few minutes?


163
0:10:29,847 --> 0:10:32,167
Don't move.


164
0:10:32,167 --> 0:10:36,487
No. Don't move.


165
0:10:36,487 --> 0:10:40,247
- Have you seen Turk?
- Yeah, l saw him.


166
0:10:40,247 --> 0:10:48,167
He just went out that door.


167
0:10:48,167 --> 0:11:3,247
Turk?


168
0:11:3,247 --> 0:11:7,687
Can't hear you.


169
0:11:7,687 --> 0:11:9,807
- What?
- Let me in!


170
0:11:9,807 --> 0:11:13,47
You love who?


171
0:11:13,47 --> 0:11:15,567
Mr Kavanaugh,
your arrhythmia's much better.


172
0:11:15,567 --> 0:11:18,647
Everything looks just great, actually.


173
0:11:18,647 --> 0:11:21,207
You sound surprised.


174
0:11:21,207 --> 0:11:23,127
lt has nothing to do with you.


175
0:11:23,127 --> 0:11:26,287
l had a run-in with Dr Kelso,
so when he switched me to you,


176
0:11:26,287 --> 0:11:30,447
l thought it would be a difficult case.


177
0:11:30,447 --> 0:11:32,327
Go on, l'm listening.


178
0:11:32,327 --> 0:11:35,967
Excuse me while l check
on another penis... patient.


179
0:11:35,967 --> 0:11:41,647
Well, he's a penis patient.


180
0:11:41,647 --> 0:11:43,7
Turk!


181
0:11:43,7 --> 0:11:44,607
No, l gotta talk to you.


182
0:11:44,607 --> 0:11:45,847
No!


183
0:11:45,847 --> 0:11:49,567
lt's nine up, OK? We just
lost our fourth, it's your ball.


184
0:11:49,567 --> 0:11:51,87
lt's important.


185
0:11:51,87 --> 0:11:55,367
This is not a joke either. This is real.
lt's surgical versus medical.


186
0:11:55,367 --> 0:11:57,887
- Your ball, you're shirts.
- Let's play.


187
0:11:57,887 --> 0:12:1,167
<i>There it was, Everything was</i>
<i>more important than me now,</i>


188
0:12:1,167 --> 0:12:3,807
Don't bring in the same crap
the last kid did.


189
0:12:3,807 --> 0:12:5,407
<i>Suddenly I was so fed up</i>


190
0:12:5,407 --> 0:12:12,127
<i>I decided to teach Turk</i>
<i>and Todd a lesson on the court,</i>


191
0:12:12,127 --> 0:12:25,727
<i>You know once I warm up a little,</i>


192
0:12:25,727 --> 0:12:27,607
JD, l'm gonna show you...


193
0:12:27,607 --> 0:12:30,327
what the deal...
Oh, oh...


194
0:12:30,327 --> 0:12:39,447
- Throw the body out of him!
- Oh!


195
0:12:39,447 --> 0:12:42,367
All right, that's game.
What's so important?


196
0:12:42,367 --> 0:12:44,287
l was looking at Bidwell...


197
0:12:44,287 --> 0:12:47,767
One second.


198
0:12:47,767 --> 0:12:51,327
l gotta go.
But you played a good game.


199
0:12:51,327 --> 0:12:53,447
l thought you sucked.


200
0:12:53,447 --> 0:13:0,487
Go get your grub on.


201
0:13:0,487 --> 0:13:7,727
- Hey, baby.
- You gotta be kidding.


202
0:13:7,727 --> 0:13:8,887
Yes?


203
0:13:8,887 --> 0:13:14,407
- Sorry to bother you, sir.
- Well, if it isn't ''sport''.


204
0:13:14,407 --> 0:13:18,687
How are things?
Did you see Mr Kavanaugh today?


205
0:13:18,687 --> 0:13:21,647
Yes.


206
0:13:21,647 --> 0:13:26,47
Yes, l did. Dr Kelso,
l just wanted to say, well,


207
0:13:26,47 --> 0:13:29,767
as far as the sweetheart thing goes,
maybe l overreacted.


208
0:13:29,767 --> 0:13:34,447
Are you sure? l wouldn't want you
to be the least bit uncomfortable.


209
0:13:34,447 --> 0:13:39,567
l have no idea what possessed me
to say anything in the first place.


210
0:13:39,567 --> 0:13:42,847
You've got to leave me alone
or l'll punish you.


211
0:13:42,847 --> 0:13:46,647
- Absolutely no idea.
- Super.


212
0:13:46,647 --> 0:14:8,327
Then run along, sweetheart.


213
0:14:8,327 --> 0:14:11,47
Have you seen
Mr Bidwell's blood work?


214
0:14:11,47 --> 0:14:12,967
No, it hasn't come back yet.


215
0:14:12,967 --> 0:14:16,807
- OK, have you seen Turk?
- Not since this morning.


216
0:14:16,807 --> 0:14:19,407
l'm sure you'll see him
before l do, so...


217
0:14:19,407 --> 0:14:23,687
Bambi, are you giving me attitude?


218
0:14:23,687 --> 0:14:26,247
What if l am?


219
0:14:26,247 --> 0:14:30,887
You have to be a minority sidekick
in a bad movie to pull that off.


220
0:14:30,887 --> 0:14:34,327
- You know what l mean, right?
- Child, you speak the truth!


221
0:14:34,327 --> 0:14:36,487
Explain it to him.


222
0:14:36,487 --> 0:14:40,167
You do the hand, then the finger,
then talk through the nose.


223
0:14:40,167 --> 0:14:44,607
Then give a lot of attitude. lf you're
not from there, you don't understand...


224
0:14:44,607 --> 0:14:46,967
- OK, l'm gonna leave now.
- What?


225
0:14:46,967 --> 0:15:10,7
Oh, no, you didn't! Where you going?
Where you going?


226
0:15:10,7 --> 0:15:11,807
Thank you very much.


227
0:15:11,807 --> 0:15:14,167
- What?
- Hi, how are you?


228
0:15:14,167 --> 0:15:17,7
l have a quick legal question.
l'm just curious.


229
0:15:17,7 --> 0:15:20,607
- What if, hypothetically...
- Oh, God! You killed somebody.


230
0:15:20,607 --> 0:15:22,47
- No!
- Someone else did.


231
0:15:22,47 --> 0:15:26,87
- No, no one killed anyone.
- Maimed, mutilated, disfigured.


232
0:15:26,87 --> 0:15:28,167
l'm not sure there is a problem.


233
0:15:28,167 --> 0:15:30,727
l'm running tests,
doing everything l should.


234
0:15:30,727 --> 0:15:34,407
lf you know something, by not
reporting it you're as culpable.


235
0:15:34,407 --> 0:15:36,487
Anything you wanna tell me?


236
0:15:36,487 --> 0:15:40,87
<i>Why am I protecting Turk</i>
<i>when he can't give me five seconds?</i>


237
0:15:40,87 --> 0:15:42,847
- Anything at all?
- <i>Tell him,</i>


238
0:15:42,847 --> 0:15:46,887
No.


239
0:15:46,887 --> 0:16:0,127
Scared the hell out of me.


240
0:16:0,127 --> 0:16:1,527
Dr Cox...


241
0:16:1,527 --> 0:16:4,847
l'm hoping there's another
Dr Cox sat behind me.


242
0:16:4,847 --> 0:16:9,447
Sending me to Kelso like that, l'm not
sure what you were trying to teach me.


243
0:16:9,447 --> 0:16:13,407
The value, and this is important,
of leaving me alone.


244
0:16:13,407 --> 0:16:16,887
- There's more to it than that.
- No, there's not.


245
0:16:16,887 --> 0:16:20,527
Look, l want you to go ahead
and spread the word.


246
0:16:20,527 --> 0:16:23,287
l've had enough.


247
0:16:23,287 --> 0:16:27,167
The next whiny intern that comes
to me for a cookie and a hug,


248
0:16:27,167 --> 0:16:29,767
l swear to Aisha,
l'm going to hurt them.


249
0:16:29,767 --> 0:16:32,47
And you, you one-woman freak show,


250
0:16:32,47 --> 0:16:35,367
take your blah-blah
to the blah-blah-ologist.


251
0:16:35,367 --> 0:16:39,247
lf you're so stupid as to
confront the Chief of Medicine,


252
0:16:39,247 --> 0:16:41,647
over some
quasi-offensive endearment,


253
0:16:41,647 --> 0:16:45,7
then you've got to replace
the captain of your brain ship


254
0:16:45,7 --> 0:16:46,767
because he's drunk.


255
0:16:46,767 --> 0:16:52,927
You're right. l need to learn to
pick my battles. Thank you, sir.


256
0:16:52,927 --> 0:16:55,927
You're welcome.


257
0:16:55,927 --> 0:16:58,87
And you say your husband
hardly wore them?


258
0:16:58,87 --> 0:17:0,407
Fantastic.


259
0:17:0,407 --> 0:17:5,447
The blood work came back.


260
0:17:5,447 --> 0:17:7,527
Negative?


261
0:17:7,527 --> 0:17:10,47
But the guy looks like death.


262
0:17:10,47 --> 0:17:12,207
Hi!


263
0:17:12,207 --> 0:17:14,887
What happened?


264
0:17:14,887 --> 0:17:19,567
There's no infection. He's diabetic.
So when someone gave him insulin,


265
0:17:19,567 --> 0:17:22,687
when he wasn't eating,
he became hypoglycaemic.


266
0:17:22,687 --> 0:17:27,127
The only person
that could've given him insulin...


267
0:17:27,127 --> 0:17:29,367
Me!


268
0:17:29,367 --> 0:17:31,727
l gave him insulin.
<i>Twice,</i>


269
0:17:31,727 --> 0:17:36,207
He's fine, Bambi. l gave him
an amp of D50 and he's eating now.


270
0:17:36,207 --> 0:17:39,727
You should probably give him
some orange juice in an hour.


271
0:17:39,727 --> 0:17:47,887
- Thank you so much. You saved my ass.
- No, it wasn't me.


272
0:17:47,887 --> 0:17:51,367
- Look, Turk.
- Come on, man. l always got your back.


273
0:17:51,367 --> 0:17:53,247
l know.


274
0:17:53,247 --> 0:17:56,207
<i>Tell him how you feel</i>
<i>without sounding like a girl,</i>


275
0:17:56,207 --> 0:18:5,47
l miss you so much
it hurts sometimes.


276
0:18:5,47 --> 0:18:7,47
OK...


277
0:18:7,47 --> 0:18:10,887
- l'm gonna let that go for now.
- Thank you.


278
0:18:10,887 --> 0:18:14,407
We'll find time to hang, man.
We're both swamped right now


279
0:18:14,407 --> 0:18:16,967
and l'm hanging out
with Carla a lot.


280
0:18:16,967 --> 0:18:20,487
But if there was someone you were into
you'd be doing the same.


281
0:18:20,487 --> 0:18:25,327
<i>Crap!</i>


282
0:18:25,327 --> 0:19:5,447
Did Nurse Roberts
sell you these?


283
0:19:5,447 --> 0:19:9,967
- You don't wanna hear about my day.
- You're right. Kiss me.


284
0:19:9,967 --> 0:19:12,767
- Right now?
- We can wait three, four seconds.


285
0:19:12,767 --> 0:19:23,7
- But l just ate, l feel gross.
- Not gross, pretty. Come here.


286
0:19:23,7 --> 0:19:26,167
JD, can we just talk for a second?


287
0:19:26,167 --> 0:19:39,167
<i>It never fails,</i>


288
0:19:39,167 --> 0:19:41,367
Oh, yeah, another one.


289
0:19:41,367 --> 0:19:43,7
How're you doing?


290
0:19:43,7 --> 0:19:45,487
Went to high school with her.


291
0:19:45,487 --> 0:19:47,567
We worked at Penguins Yoghurt.


292
0:19:47,567 --> 0:19:51,567
- l met her on a bus.
- She'll come around.


293
0:19:51,567 --> 0:19:53,887
Pretzel?


294
0:19:53,887 --> 0:19:55,287
Thank you.


295
0:19:55,287 --> 0:19:59,887
The first few weeks have been so hard,
mentally, physically, emotionally.


296
0:19:59,887 --> 0:20:2,167
lt's like math camp all over again.


297
0:20:2,167 --> 0:20:4,967
Not that l've been to math camp,
it's an expression.


298
0:20:4,967 --> 0:20:7,7
l use it all the time.


299
0:20:7,7 --> 0:20:9,7
- Come on.
- Anyway...


300
0:20:9,7 --> 0:20:13,767
<i>Choosing friendship over sex is</i>
<i>the last thing any guy wants to hear</i>


301
0:20:13,767 --> 0:20:15,847
<i>but you know what?</i>


302
0:20:15,847 --> 0:20:18,647
<i>This time it actually</i>
<i>made sense to me,</i>


303
0:20:18,647 --> 0:20:22,87
<i>Besides I challenge anyone</i>
<i>to survive being an intern</i>


304
0:20:22,87 --> 0:20:27,527
<i>without having a close</i>
<i>group of friends to lean on,</i>


305
0:20:27,527 --> 0:20:30,367
l can't believe
you lost our bottle opener.


306
0:20:30,367 --> 0:20:36,167
Yeah, l know.


307
0:20:36,167 --> 0:20:40,687
l miss it so much
it hurts sometimes.


308
0:20:40,687 --> 0:22:40,687
- You're a bad person.
- Don't judge me.
