###9 [FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###15 Should we interview Shane Smith more?
###17 SHANE SMITH: Here?
###19 SPIKE JONZE: Yeah, right here.
###20 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###20 SPIKE JONZE: You know, I always think that a lot of
###21 what "Vice" has done has happened because of your sheer
###24 will of it.
###25 You've willed it to be through your force of life.
###28 And--
###29 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, I think that too.
###30 [LAUGHTER]
###34 SPIKE JONZE: You know, it's part having a vision, part PT
###40 Barnum hyping it, and sort of willing everyone to
###46 go along with you.
###48 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, when you're starting out, you have to
###50 definitely be louder noise than the other guys.
###55 SPIKE JONZE: You freak me out.
###57 SHANE SMITH: No, I'm the only one that
###58 doesn't freak you out.
###59 See, you've forgotten.
###60 SPIKE JONZE: Oh, that's right.
###61 You don't freak me out anymore.
###64 SHANE SMITH: I used to freak you out?
###65 SPIKE JONZE: No.
###65 SHANE SMITH: See, I could interview you.
###67 So how did I freak you out?
###68 SPIKE JONZE: I would say you never freaked me out, but I
###69 would say you've calmed down a lot since I've known you in
###71 the last eight years.
###73 You're calmer.
###74 SHANE SMITH: I was too--
###76 SPIKE JONZE: You had, like, this gusto, which both made
###84 everything happen, but also sometimes--
###87 here's where you freaked me out.
###90 It's because whenever you'd tell me what was going on,
###92 you'd be like people are freaking out
###93 over what we're doing.
###94 We just put the new issue, and people are freaking out.
###96 We're starting a new magazine in Croatia.
###98 People are freaking out.
###100 We just wrote this script and people are freaking out.
###102 And like, everything was on 10.
###104 People were freaking out about everything.
###106 And this was like eight years ago.
###108 So, you know, you were a younger man.
###109 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, well know, I probably had to sell it a
###111 lot more because we weren't as established.
###113 So I had to be, like, always, like, pumping it, pumping it.
###116 And for sure, you're right.
###117 So I was probably selling Vice with my head nod.
###120 People are freaking out!
###121 Spike!
###124 SPIKE JONZE: How do you think you've mellowed out in the
###125 last 8 or 10 years?
###129 SHANE SMITH: You know, the truth of it is, I always
###132 thought I was going to die because, when I was young, I
###135 was in kind of a quasi gang.
###137 There was 12 of us.
###139 And then by the time I was 18, nine had died.
###144 So I would just get wasted, and get into fights, and
###147 screw, and smash things, and--
###151 I didn't care.
###152 And I would always be like, we have to do it now, and
###155 fucking let's go!
###156 Because I didn't there would be a lot of time.
###159 So I think that when you realize--
###162 I realized my mortality was a good thing.
###165 Because I'm like, first of all, I'm going to be around
###167 for a few years, hopefully.
###168 And we can take our time.
###170 We can enjoy it.
###171 And I didn't have to drink every day.
###174 I didn't have to eat five steaks everyday, although you
###176 wouldn't know it.
###179 I don't have to coke all night.
###180 I don't have to fuck 20 women.
###182 And when that sort of switched, then
###185 you're like, OK, now.
###189 Now what do I really want to do?
###192 So I want to work.
###194 I want to put my indelible mark on the cultural fabric
###197 because I'm an egotist still.
###200 I don't want to just be a guy know for business or making
###203 "Vice." I want to write books, and make films,
###207 and make the biggest--
###209 I want to be like Tom Freston and you, rolled into one.
###211 
###214 I want to do a lot of stuff.
###215 But I want to do it my way and be happy.
###218 And also enjoy traveling to places like this, which is the
###221 most beautiful place on Earth, and crying.
###224 SPIKE JONZE: And crying?
###225 SHANE SMITH: Yeah.
###226 SPIKE JONZE: Come here, let's cry.
###228 Come cry with me.
###230 It's OK.
###232 SHANE SMITH: See, [INAUDIBLE]
###233 that's a good interview.
###236 You're getting up there.
###237 That's--
###237 SPIKE JONZE: We're getting there, we're not they're yet.
###239 We're not there yet.
###242 MALE SPEAKER: No one has shit their pants.
###244 SPIKE JONZE: Yeah, then we're there.
###245 
###252 Ah, yes.
###253 Woo.
###254 
###261 So Shane, so this game goes, I give you a subject, and you
###266 give me something profound, and quick, and mindblowing.
###272 And if I don't like it, I cut your neck off.
###274 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###275 SPIKE JONZE: OK.
###276 How about, tell me about self-doubt.
###288 
###291 SHANE SMITH: Oof.
###294 I think my hyperbole was a blanket again self-doubt.
###299 I think everybody has self-doubt.
###302 And you mask it in different ways.
###307 Tattoos hide self-doubt.
###310 Muscles hides the self-doubt.
###311 Fashion hides self-doubt.
###313 We put on outfits and personas to mask our self-doubt.
###318 And for me, I had to push it to the back of my
###325 sub-consciousness because failure couldn't be an option.
###330 Uh-oh, there it goes.
###332 SPIKE JONZE: This is the effect he's had on
###334 [INAUDIBLE].
###335 SHANE SMITH: I'm so scintillating.
###337 SPIKE JONZE: So drugs.
###338 SHANE SMITH: Drugs.
###339 Drugs, look, I think that the whole world is drugged on one
###343 thing or another.
###345 SPIKE JONZE: What drugs were you ever addicted to?
###346 
###349 SHANE SMITH: So cigarettes.
###350 Cigarettes was the hardest thing I ever had to quit.
###352 They're insidious.
###353 Alcohol, there's a quote from Napoleon which is a conquest
###361 has made me, and conquest must sustain me.
###365 And so I used to say, alcohol has made, and alcohol must
###367 sustain me.
###369 Because everything I did, my hilarity, my lunacy, all the
###373 stories, all the crazy things I did was all just
###375 booze-fueled.
###376 
###378 SPIKE JONZE: Did you go through a period where you had
###379 to be the Shane Smith character?
###381 SPIKE JONZE: Correct, yes.
###383 Describe that Shane Smith character.
###385 SHANE SMITH: Sort of the poor man's Hemingway, sort of bon
###389 vivant storyteller drunk.
###393 Let's have 14 bottles of wine at dinner, roast suckling pig,
###397 and a story about chopping off a dude's head in
###400 the desert or something.
###402 Like, adventurer.
###405 I was never really addicted to anything except for
###407 cigarettes and booze.
###409 And I probably did too much cocaine for a
###411 little period of time.
###412 SPIKE JONZE: Yeah, you did, a lot.
###413 SHANE SMITH: How do you know?
###414 SPIKE JONZE: Because I remember seeing you.
###416 SHANE SMITH: I used to do coke off knives.
###420 SPIKE JONZE: Off [INAUDIBLE]?
###420 SHANE SMITH: Off knives, yeah, any kind of knife
###424 SPIKE JONZE: This is--
###424 SHANE SMITH: Whoa, don't-- fuck.
###426 No, no, no, no, no.
###430 That's not a fun game.
###431 [INAUDIBLE]
###433 
###436 We're going to put this back in the area where it's
###438 supposed to go.
###440 SPIKE JONZE: OK, good job with the sound bites.
###441 SHANE SMITH: Oh, thanks.
###442 Again
###443 SPIKE JONZE: What do you think, like, how she we end
###446 this thing?
###447 SHANE SMITH: We should go swimming and end it as
###448 the sun goes down.
###449 SPIKE JONZE: OK, that sounds good.
###450 Making love on the beach?
###451 SHANE SMITH: Yeah.
###452 SPIKE JONZE: OK, got it.
###453 Oh, wow let's go down there.
###455 (SINGING) A salaam aleikum.
###458 A salaam aleikum.
###459 
###472 What does it say?
###473
