211
0:6:9,29 --> 0:6:11,6
We're under attack from
Selena Gomez fans.


212
0:6:11,6 --> 0:6:13,56
-Nonstop, bomb, bomb,
going off.


213
0:6:13,56 --> 0:6:14,85
-We apologize.


214
0:6:14,85 --> 0:6:15,3
-I apologize.


215
0:6:15,3 --> 0:6:16,55
-We are sorry.


216
0:6:16,55 --> 0:6:18,35
-We did not mean to--


217
0:6:18,35 --> 0:6:19,82
just please--


218
0:6:19,82 --> 0:6:21,34
-Leave us alone.


219
0:6:21,34 --> 0:6:22,71
-And we surrendered.


220
0:6:22,71 --> 0:6:25,16
-You want to try to call her
right now, on speaker phone?


221
0:6:25,16 --> 0:6:26,5
See what happens.


222
0:6:26,5 --> 0:6:26,69
-Sure.


223
0:6:26,69 --> 0:6:27,39
-What do you think?


224
0:6:27,39 --> 0:6:28,975
Two rings and ignore?


225
0:6:28,975 --> 0:6:30,4
-I say she doesn't answer.


226
0:6:30,4 --> 0:6:31,204
-She's not going to answer.


227
0:6:31,204 --> 0:6:34,182
-I'm going to go with
a no answer.


228
0:6:34,182 --> 0:6:36,24
-The number you dialed is
not a working number.


229
0:6:36,24 --> 0:6:37,6
-Changed it.


230
0:6:37,6 --> 0:6:38,31
-Ah, changed.


231
0:6:38,31 --> 0:6:41,473



232
0:6:41,473 --> 0:6:42,451
-What's the goal?


233
0:6:42,451 --> 0:6:43,98
-What's the goal?


234
0:6:43,98 --> 0:6:46,61
-The goal is to be like
Justin Bieber, yo.


235
0:6:46,61 --> 0:6:48,0
Make money like that fool.


236
0:6:48,0 --> 0:6:50,1
-I want to be a millionaire
for real.


237
0:6:50,1 --> 0:6:52,596
I want to make just millions.


238
0:6:52,596 --> 0:6:53,55
-I want to fuck celebrity
chicks.


239
0:6:53,55 --> 0:6:56,31
-When people say fame, yeah, I
want to be fucking famous.


240
0:6:56,31 --> 0:7:0,55
I want to fucking be like
balling, living in Hollywood,


241
0:7:0,55 --> 0:7:3,1
fucking living that life.


242
0:7:3,1 --> 0:7:3,91
