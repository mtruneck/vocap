2
0:0:0,72 --> 0:0:4,87
FEMALE SPEAKER: Gosh, sex
can be so confusing.


3
0:0:4,87 --> 0:0:7,81
There's so much to
think about.


4
0:0:7,81 --> 0:0:9,15
Who should I go out with?


5
0:0:9,15 --> 0:0:10,62
How many wives do you
have right now?


6
0:0:10,62 --> 0:0:12,14
MALE SPEAKER: Last time
I looked, it was 248.


7
0:0:12,14 --> 0:0:13,83
FEMALE SPEAKER: What should
I wear on dates?


8
0:0:13,83 --> 0:0:15,865
So how long have you
been dressing up?

0:0:15,865 --> 0:0:17,605
MALE SPEAKER: Since about 14.


10
0:0:17,605 --> 0:0:19,33
FEMALE SPEAKER: Am
I wild enough?


11
0:0:19,33 --> 0:0:21,97
What is a normal relationship?


12
0:0:21,97 --> 0:0:25,81
You kind of have a small
dick, though.


13
0:0:25,81 --> 0:0:26,78
Whatever.


14
0:0:26,78 --> 0:0:29,55
I guess it's up to me to give
you the sex ed you never got


15
0:0:29,55 --> 0:0:30,8
in high school.


16
0:0:30,8 --> 0:2:30,8
