###17 APRIL BLOOMFIELD: I don't ever cook stuff that I
###18 don't want to eat.
###20 I cook for my soul.
###22 I cook for my heart.
###24 If I don't feel it's right, I won't put it on.
###27 I have very high standards.
###28 
###30 I'm April Bloomfield.
###31 I'm the co-owner of the Spotted Pig, the Breslin, and
###36 the John Dory.
###37 This is Ken Friedman, my partner in crime.
###41 
###48 I realized that I wanted to be a chef when I was
###51 just turning 16.
###52 I hadn't got into my chosen profession, which was I wanted
###55 to be a policewoman.
###56 I saw my sister walk in, and she had her chef whites on,
###59 and come back from a shift, looking a bit grubby but very
###62 professional, and I was like, maybe I'll do that.
###65 I like that uniform.
###66 
###76 We are at the John Dory Oyster Bar 29th and Broadway, and
###81 we're about to tuck in to some cocktails.
###83 So this is Peter Cho, he's the head chef at the Breslin.
###87 This is Scottie Boggs.
###89 Scott is a farmer.
###91 This is Christina, she's the Sous Chef at the John Dory.
###95 So, we're just going to have a few nibbles.
###97 We've got some oysters coming.
###99 
###103 What have you got?
###105 Does that have alcohol in it?
###108 Wow, that's amazing.
###109 I'll have what she's having.
###111 I moved straight to London.
###112 I worked in a restaurant called Kensington Place.
###115 I went to another called the Brackenbury It was the
###117 forefront of the gastropub movement, I suppose.
###120 The chef there was a very, very
###122 professional dedicated chef.
###123 He'd use every part of the animal.
###125 He'd scrape the bones clean.
###126 Who doesn't love that, so you learn not to waste stuff.
###131 Throughout my career, I've just learned how to do
###134 different things in different restaurants.
###135 Peter, have you tried this yet?
###137 This is a mussel corn chowder with some Andouille sausage
###141 from Calabria.
###142 It's made with Calabrese chili peppers.
###144 It's super spicy and porky.
###147 It just goes so well with the corn and the mussels.
###152 Cheers, guys.
###153 
###158 We're going to go to Rucola, Joe Pasqualetto.
###161 He actually has a fantastic restaurant in Brooklyn, very
###165 rustic cuisine.
###166 Italian, of course, his last name gives it away.
###169 
###180 I run my kitchen, you know, I like to think I run a tight
###184 ship, but we like to have fun at the same time.
###186 We like to have a laugh and a joke.
###188 But when it comes to the food, it's all very serious.
###191 You have to treat the food with respect.
###193 Hopefully, I lead by example, and I touch it in a certain
###197 way, and I put it away in a certain way, and I season it a
###201 certain way, and cook it in a certain way.
###202 And hopefully, that translates to a nice
###206 orderly and healthy kitchen.
###209 This is Jamie she's the GM, wonderful GM at The Spotted
###214 Pig, and head chef, Ralphie, at The
###217 Spotted Pig is here also.
###218 Who's running the restaurant?
###219 RALPH JOHNSON: Nobody.
###222 APRIL BLOOMFIELD: So after the Brackenbury, I went to the
###224 River Cafe.
###225 I loved the River Cafe.
###226 I stayed four years there, and became sous chef.
###229 I wrote menus, did ordering, and tried to teach and learn,
###234 and it was definitely something that made me more
###237 secure in my decision about being a cook.
###240 And then I got offered a job to come to New York.
###243 The rest is history.
###244 
###248 KEN FRIEDMAN: I was looking for a chef, and I kind of
###249 asked around.
###251 And I wasn't really sure what I wanted.
###254 But I wanted somebody interesting, not just a local
###257 chef that kicked around from restaurant to restaurant.
###259 Jamie Oliver came to town.
###261 I tried to see if I could get him to be the chef.
###264 He said, no, you can't afford me, there's no way.
###266 I'm a big star in England. "Are you thick?" I think is
###270 what he said.
###271 APRIL BLOOMFIELD: "Are you a twat?"
###273 KEN FRIEDMAN: Yeah, I think it was more like-- yeah.
###275 He said there's a woman who works at The
###279 River Cafe in London.
###281 He said, you might be able to get her.
###282 She's like the next-- or she'll be the next head chef
###285 there eventually if she stays.
###287 I already knew that I wanted her even before I met her.
###289 
###299 APRIL BLOOMFIELD: I think what we have is very special.
###302 It think it works.
###304 Ken is so good at what he does.
###306 KEN FRIEDMAN: What do I do?
###309 APRIL BLOOMFIELD: You move pictures and water plants.
###313 We kind of just let each other do their own
###316 thing, and it works.
###317 We trust each other.
###319 And we talk if we have a problem, which is very rare.
###324 JAMIE AND RALPH: [SING-SONG]
###324 Chef--
###325 chef!
###327 
###333 APRIL BLOOMFIELD: It's amazing.
###334 It tastes like curry.
###337 RALPH JOHNSON: Quite truthfully, before here, I
###338 never worked anywhere for more than a year and a half.
###342 And it's been a wonderful experience being in New York
###344 and working for April and finding my path as a cook.
###347 
###351 MALE SPEAKER 1: Tomato potato salad.
###353 APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Tomato potato.
###354 
###363 Hey, babe.
###364 JOE PASQUALETTO: How are you?
###365 Thank you.
###365 APRIL BLOOMFIELD: It's so delicious.
###369 Bravo, bravo!
###370 [CHEERING]
###376 
###391 APRIL BLOOMFIELD: OK.
###391 No screaming like girls, please.
###394 Anyway, so we're going to go ahead back to Manhattan, and
###397 we're going to go to The Breslin.
###399 
###404 So we're going to go over to the Breslin right now, and
###407 we're going to make some chicken liver on toast, yum.
###409 
###416 So the Breslin is a bit different.
###417 It's a bit more kind of sharp corners, a bit more glassy,
###422 kind of moody, in a good way.
###426 And the food is a lot more hearty.
###428 It's definitely a place you want to hang out in the winter
###431 it's snowing outside, and you want a nice glass of whiskey,
###437 and a big pig's trotter or something.
###438 So I have some chicken livers, and I have some caramelized
###445 onions, little bit of olive oil, some
###448 salt, and some chili.
###450 And then I have some parsley with their stalks on, freshly
###455 sliced lemon and some port and Madeira.
###459 
###462 I like to be present.
###464 I like to be in my kitchens.
###465 I like to create.
###466 I like to teach.
###468 All those flavors I mingle up-- sweet, salty.
###472 The three restaurants that I have right now, the Pig, the
###475 Breslin, and the John Dory, they have their own
###478 personality, which I like.
###479 And I think it's important to have personalities, not just a
###483 cookie cutter.
###484 It keeps me inspired, and it keeps my chefs inspired.
###487 It gives them something else to move onto.
###489 Helps keep people, stay in the family.
###491 Like my chefs, if they feel like they want to have a
###493 different experience, we can just move them to the John
###496 Dory or the Pig.
###496 I think it benefits everybody.
###498 It's important to express your vision.
###501 That's what they're there for.
###503 You have a lot of responsibility to your staff
###506 to help them grow as cooks.
###508 So yeah, it's important to be there.
###510 If you're not there, then what's the point of them being
###512 there kind of thing.
###514 Yeah, I like to work in general.
###517 I come from a working class family.
###519 I'm very proud of that.
###522 At the end of the day, I feel tired, because I've been
###525 working hard, and my feet are hurting, in a
###528 sadistic kind of way.
###531 But I do.
###532 I'd rather work hard than not work hard, and be lazy.
###537 
###547 MALE SPEAKER 2: Chicken liver toast?
###548 MALE SPEAKER 3: Oh, wonderful.
###549 Thank you.
###550 
###563 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh!
###564 
###567 APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Hey guys, we have a bit of pickles.
###569
