0:0:7,767 --> 0:0:14,47
ALICE ROBERTS: they say this is where it all began.


2
0:0:14,47 --> 0:0:20,727
that we are all children of Africa.


3
0:0:20,727 --> 0:0:26,367
But if so, why do we look so different?


4
0:0:26,367 --> 0:0:30,86
And how on earth could a handful of African families


5
0:0:30,86 --> 0:0:45,286
become a whole world full of people?


6
0:0:45,286 --> 0:0:50,87
I'm Alice Roberts, medical doctor and anthropologist.


7
0:0:50,87 --> 0:0:55,326
I'm fascinated by what bones, stones,


8
0:0:55,326 --> 0:1:1,207
and even our bodies can reveal about the distant past.


9
0:1:1,207 --> 0:1:5,846
I'm going in search of the traces left by our African ancestors


10
0:1:5,846 --> 0:1:10,406
and their journeys to populate the world.


11
0:1:10,406 --> 0:1:13,447
this time, Europe.


12
0:1:13,447 --> 0:1:16,846
A dangerous journey


13
0:1:16,846 --> 0:1:21,206
and a formidable rival.


14
0:1:21,206 --> 0:1:23,846
We're going to be excavating the sea bottom


15
0:1:23,846 --> 0:1:25,566
in search of Neanderthals.


16
0:1:25,566 --> 0:1:30,167
the unexpected weapons in our battle for survival.


17
0:1:30,167 --> 0:1:35,246
I don't think it would have even crossed my mind to mate with a Neanderthal.


18
0:1:35,246 --> 0:1:37,927
Spectacular new discoveries.


19
0:1:37,927 --> 0:1:41,566
I'm blown away by that. I mean, that is just amazing.


20
0:1:41,566 --> 0:1:50,927
And the surprising story of why Europeans turned white.


21
0:1:50,927 --> 0:1:54,7
Come with me in the footsteps of our ancestors


22
0:1:54,7 --> 0:2:18,646
on the most epic adventure ever undertaken.


23
0:2:18,646 --> 0:2:25,806
My journey begins in the remote forests of Eastern Europe.


24
0:2:25,806 --> 0:2:30,486
SILvIu: Okay, so you see the cave is down there.


25
0:2:30,486 --> 0:2:34,727
ROBERTS: I'm being led to an ancient cave.


26
0:2:34,727 --> 0:2:38,727
Its location is only known to a handful of people,


27
0:2:38,727 --> 0:2:56,727
including Silviu constantin.


28
0:2:56,727 --> 0:3:0,646
I'm in Romania, somewhere to the south of Transylvania,


29
0:3:0,646 --> 0:3:5,646
and I'm just about to enter the cave of pestera cu Oase.


30
0:3:5,646 --> 0:3:7,127
It's very remote -


31
0:3:7,127 --> 0:3:10,326
about a day and a half's drive from the capital, Bucharest,


32
0:3:10,326 --> 0:3:12,847
and then a trek through the woods.


33
0:3:12,847 --> 0:3:15,127
But I've wanted to come to this place


34
0:3:15,127 --> 0:3:18,86
ever since I first heard what was found here.


35
0:3:18,86 --> 0:3:19,926
Because just a few years ago


36
0:3:19,926 --> 0:3:30,46
an incredibly exciting discovery was made in this cave.


37
0:3:30,46 --> 0:3:35,127
(WATER DRIPPING)


38
0:3:35,127 --> 0:3:39,526
ROBERTS: Something had been hidden here for thousands of years.


39
0:3:39,526 --> 0:3:45,646
Something extremely rare.


40
0:3:45,646 --> 0:3:47,687
In 2002,


41
0:3:47,687 --> 0:3:52,86
a group of divers exploring the furthest reaches of the cave


42
0:3:52,86 --> 0:3:56,7
discovered a hidden chamber.


43
0:3:56,7 --> 0:4:0,206
the cave became known as Pestera cu Oase,


44
0:4:0,206 --> 0:4:2,646
''the cave of Bones. ''


45
0:4:2,646 --> 0:4:6,326
(SILvIU SPEAKING ENGLISH)


46
0:4:6,326 --> 0:4:8,967
ROBERTS: And how's it looking? Are we gonna have to go right underwater?


47
0:4:8,967 --> 0:4:16,887
(SILvIU SPEAKING ENGLISH)


48
0:4:16,887 --> 0:4:21,567
ROBERTS: We're following the course of an underground river


49
0:4:21,567 --> 0:4:25,247
through narrow tunnels.


50
0:4:25,247 --> 0:4:38,206
ROBERTS: pretty tight.


51
0:4:38,206 --> 0:4:45,846
Eventually, we get close to where the discovery was made.


52
0:4:45,846 --> 0:4:55,567
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)


53
0:4:55,567 --> 0:4:57,526
Silviu, this looks like the end of the line.


54
0:4:57,526 --> 0:4:59,807
(SILvIU SPEAKING ENGLISH)


55
0:4:59,807 --> 0:5:3,206
And, Silviu, when you came to the cave, what did you find here?


56
0:5:3,206 --> 0:5:18,447
(SPEAKING ENGLISH)


57
0:5:18,447 --> 0:5:21,166
ROBERTS: And how old is it?


58
0:5:21,166 --> 0:5:24,47
And 40,000 years old makes it


59
0:5:24,47 --> 0:5:27,807
the first human remains, modern-human remains,


60
0:5:27,807 --> 0:5:31,286
in Europe, and you must have been excited when you got that date.


61
0:5:31,286 --> 0:5:35,807
(SILvIU SPEAKING ENGLISH)


62
0:5:35,807 --> 0:5:38,646
Which was...


63
0:5:38,646 --> 0:5:52,567
(SPEAKING ENGLISH)


64
0:5:52,567 --> 0:5:55,367
And this is what they found.


65
0:5:55,367 --> 0:5:59,367
Not in one piece like this, but in hundreds of fragments


66
0:5:59,367 --> 0:6:2,846
which have been painstakingly glued back together


67
0:6:2,846 --> 0:6:12,447
until we can look at the face of the first known modern European.


68
0:6:12,447 --> 0:6:17,406
And we can be absolutely sure that this is a modern human.


69
0:6:17,406 --> 0:6:20,166
The shape of the skull is unmistakable.


70
0:6:20,166 --> 0:6:25,7
This lovely round brain case just gives it away.


71
0:6:25,7 --> 0:6:30,166
But there are some bits of it that are distinctly less modern-looking.


72
0:6:30,166 --> 0:6:32,447
It's got enormous teeth.


73
0:6:32,447 --> 0:6:37,247
They are massive, compared with the teeth of people today.


74
0:6:37,247 --> 0:6:41,927
Now, those huge teeth are also reflected in the jawbone from the cave,


75
0:6:41,927 --> 0:6:43,646
which is from another person,


76
0:6:43,646 --> 0:6:47,326
but it's also very robust, very chunky.


77
0:6:47,326 --> 0:6:50,607
And so, when I look at the jawbone and the skull together,


78
0:6:50,607 --> 0:6:55,607
I can start to imagine what those early Europeans looked like.


79
0:6:55,607 --> 0:7:6,687
Much more rugged in the face than people do today.


80
0:7:6,687 --> 0:7:21,127
ROBERTS: Who was this person?


81
0:7:21,127 --> 0:7:23,447
Forensic artist Richard Neave


82
0:7:23,447 --> 0:7:32,766
has helped the police solve murder cases by reconstructing faces from skulls.


83
0:7:32,766 --> 0:7:36,766
In the hope of discovering more about the first Europeans


84
0:7:36,766 --> 0:7:43,406
we've asked him to reconstruct the face of the Oase skull.


85
0:7:43,406 --> 0:7:50,286
-So this is Oase. -This is Oase. There we are.


86
0:7:50,286 --> 0:7:54,487
It's wonderful to see, him or her, we're not quite sure, are we...


87
0:7:54,487 --> 0:7:56,7
-No, no. -...fleshed out.


88
0:7:56,7 --> 0:7:58,567
RICHARD: A touch androgynous, maybe, this one.


89
0:7:58,567 --> 0:8:0,47
ROBERTS: It's quite strange, actually,


90
0:8:0,47 --> 0:8:2,687
'cause this doesn't particularly look like


91
0:8:2,687 --> 0:8:5,966
European or African or Asian. It looks, sort of,


92
0:8:5,966 --> 0:8:8,406
almost quite generic, but then I suppose


93
0:8:8,406 --> 0:8:11,127
that's what you'd expect from one of the earliest Europeans.


94
0:8:11,127 --> 0:8:13,47
RICHARD: You look at this and you can think to yourself,


95
0:8:13,47 --> 0:8:14,766
it could go either way.


96
0:8:14,766 --> 0:8:18,127
(STAMMERS) It's almost as though it's a face in flux.


97
0:8:18,127 --> 0:8:21,646
It's got features which could go in any direction.


98
0:8:21,646 --> 0:8:27,927
It could become Negroid. It could become Southeast Asian.


99
0:8:27,927 --> 0:8:30,367
It could become European.


100
0:8:30,367 --> 0:8:33,486
There's the potential for all those different directions


101
0:8:33,486 --> 0:8:36,647
and that's what I find so exciting about it.


102
0:8:36,647 --> 0:8:39,486
ROBERTS: Obviously you've made this in clay and that's why it's brown, but...


103
0:8:39,486 --> 0:8:42,486
-Yes. -...in fact, it's very likely that these


104
0:8:42,486 --> 0:8:45,206
earliest of Europeans were


105
0:8:45,206 --> 0:8:47,807
quite dark-skinned, much, much darker-skinned


106
0:8:47,807 --> 0:8:50,6
than we think of Europeans being today.


107
0:8:50,6 --> 0:8:51,846
-Yes. -Because, at the end of the day,


108
0:8:51,846 --> 0:8:54,246
you know, they're only just arriving in Europe.


109
0:8:54,246 --> 0:8:56,206
They're coming from much more tropical places.


110
0:8:56,206 --> 0:8:57,527
-Yeah. -So, I think, you know,


111
0:8:57,527 --> 0:8:59,966
we may be looking at something which is actually quite lifelike here.


112
0:8:59,966 --> 0:9:7,126
RICHARD: We're not too far from... No. ROBERTS: No.


113
0:9:7,126 --> 0:9:11,407
I've been really excited to see what this face would end up looking like,


114
0:9:11,407 --> 0:9:19,886
and I do feel as though I'm getting much closer to our ancestors.


115
0:9:19,886 --> 0:9:26,287
But where did these first European people come from?


116
0:9:26,287 --> 0:9:40,47
And why do we find their bones in a Romanian cave?


117
0:9:40,47 --> 0:9:44,246
Previously, I found evidence that everyone outside Africa


118
0:9:44,246 --> 0:9:47,326
descends from one small group of people


119
0:9:47,326 --> 0:9:54,366
that left the continent around 70,000 years ago.


120
0:9:54,366 --> 0:9:58,246
Some of their descendants must have made it north,


121
0:9:58,246 --> 0:10:13,527
through the Middle East, towards modern-day turkey.


122
0:10:13,527 --> 0:10:15,486
This is border country.


123
0:10:15,486 --> 0:10:19,206
Thirty miles away, Turkey meets Syria and the Middle East.


124
0:10:19,206 --> 0:10:23,567
Today, everything in that direction might look alien and hostile,


125
0:10:23,567 --> 0:10:25,287
but 50,000 years ago


126
0:10:25,287 --> 0:10:28,407
it was Europe, the land that lay ahead,


127
0:10:28,407 --> 0:10:37,606
which would be more dangerous than they could ever have imagined.


128
0:10:37,606 --> 0:10:40,647
Venturing this way, people would have been coming to lands


129
0:10:40,647 --> 0:10:48,886
far colder and more challenging than anything they'd experienced before.


130
0:10:48,886 --> 0:10:52,167
traces of their journey all that time ago


131
0:10:52,167 --> 0:10:58,966
are few and far between.


132
0:10:58,966 --> 0:11:2,767
But some important clues have been unearthed


133
0:11:2,767 --> 0:11:9,606
in southern turkey.


134
0:11:9,606 --> 0:11:13,407
And this is how we know that people came through Turkey


135
0:11:13,407 --> 0:11:14,687
at this point in time.


136
0:11:14,687 --> 0:11:17,767
Now, it might look utterly insignificant,


137
0:11:17,767 --> 0:11:20,167
but shells like this one were found at a place


138
0:11:20,167 --> 0:11:22,366
called ucagizli on the Turkish coast


139
0:11:22,366 --> 0:11:25,6
and they are vital clues.


140
0:11:25,6 --> 0:11:27,47
The hole in them suggests


141
0:11:27,47 --> 0:11:29,567
that they were pendants, perhaps part of a necklace,


142
0:11:29,567 --> 0:11:31,527
and the ucagizli shell beads


143
0:11:31,527 --> 0:11:35,767
date back to around 42,000 years ago.


144
0:11:35,767 --> 0:11:38,486
They are the first pieces of evidence that we have


145
0:11:38,486 --> 0:11:46,527
as we follow the trail of our European ancestors.


146
0:11:46,527 --> 0:11:49,167
there may have been other routes into Europe,


147
0:11:49,167 --> 0:11:57,647
but the evidence we have seems to point in this direction.


148
0:11:57,647 --> 0:12:16,6
So I'm heading to Istanbul.


149
0:12:16,6 --> 0:12:18,206
Here, for a few turkish lira,


150
0:12:18,206 --> 0:12:20,407
taxi drivers like Ehsan Akmar


151
0:12:20,407 --> 0:12:23,767
carry their passengers between two continents.


152
0:12:23,767 --> 0:12:25,767
EHSAN: That's Golden Horn. ROBERTS: Right.


153
0:12:25,767 --> 0:12:28,287
(LAuGHING) I'll tell you what, I'll hold that, you drive.


154
0:12:28,287 --> 0:12:30,687
No, no. Don't worry about that. I don't kill anybody yet.


155
0:12:30,687 --> 0:12:32,726

158
0:12:35,206 --> 0:12:36,966
ROBERTS: So, Ehsan, as a taxi driver... EHSAN: Yeah?


159
0:12:36,966 --> 0:12:40,246
...do you cross over between Asia and Europe every day?


160
0:12:40,246 --> 0:12:42,807
-Most people live in Asian side. -ROBERTS: Yeah.


161
0:12:42,807 --> 0:12:47,287
Working that side. Because most office and business here,


162
0:12:47,287 --> 0:12:49,447
more houses there.


163
0:12:49,447 --> 0:12:53,846
But I'm here looking for traces of people who crossed the Bosporus


164
0:12:53,846 --> 0:12:57,647
maybe 50, maybe 40,000 years ago.


165
0:12:57,647 --> 0:12:59,407
My God! How can I know that time?

0:13:1,47 --> 0:13:2,246
Let me I pray.

(BOTH LAuGHING)


169
0:13:3,366 --> 0:13:4,567
This is too...


170
0:13:4,567 --> 0:13:6,486
I don't know how can this generation...


171
0:13:6,486 --> 0:13:8,886
How can I know that generation? My God!


172
0:13:8,886 --> 0:13:17,807
Alice, now, you're made me trouble that kind. But that's okay.


173
0:13:17,807 --> 0:13:21,447
ROBERTS: I bail out of the taxi and catch the ferry


174
0:13:21,447 --> 0:13:31,86
to cross from one continent to another.


175
0:13:31,86 --> 0:13:33,407
this is the Bosporus,


176
0:13:33,407 --> 0:13:48,6
and here it separates Asia from Europe.


177
0:13:48,6 --> 0:13:54,366
this is one challenge our ancestors would not have faced.


178
0:13:54,366 --> 0:13:58,287
When they came this way, sea levels were much lower


179
0:13:58,287 --> 0:14:16,966
and they could have walked across into Europe.


180
0:14:16,966 --> 0:14:21,687
But can we really retrace their steps, using only a few shells


181
0:14:21,687 --> 0:14:24,687
and a scattering of artefacts?


182
0:14:24,687 --> 0:14:27,366
The good news is we don't have to.


183
0:14:27,366 --> 0:14:29,246
The evidence is all around us -


184
0:14:29,246 --> 0:14:33,606
or to be more precise, inside all of us.


185
0:14:33,606 --> 0:14:36,767
Our DNA tells us something incredible


186
0:14:36,767 --> 0:14:42,126
by revealing the existence of one very special woman.


187
0:14:42,126 --> 0:14:45,246
We don't know who she was or where she lived.


188
0:14:45,246 --> 0:14:48,927
And in fact, we have no physical evidence of her at all.


189
0:14:48,927 --> 0:14:52,726
No bones. No stone tools. No beads.


190
0:14:52,726 --> 0:14:57,486
But we do know that she existed because of her genetic legacy.


191
0:14:57,486 --> 0:15:1,366
And some scientists have felt moved to name her Europa,


192
0:15:1,366 --> 0:15:10,47
because in one sense hers is the founding lineage of Europe.


193
0:15:10,47 --> 0:15:13,687
today, 10% of Europeans can trace their genes


194
0:15:13,687 --> 0:15:15,966
back to this one woman.


195
0:15:15,966 --> 0:15:20,447
Geneticists estimate that she lived around 40,000 years ago.


196
0:15:20,447 --> 0:15:23,287
And that fits with the archaeological evidence,


197
0:15:23,287 --> 0:15:27,326
like those shell beads.


198
0:15:27,326 --> 0:15:30,326
It's incredible to think of Europa's descendants


199
0:15:30,326 --> 0:15:35,126
as a small wave of nomads, making their way through this region


200
0:15:35,126 --> 0:15:41,6
all those years ago.


201
0:15:41,6 --> 0:15:57,126
But where might they have gone next?


202
0:15:57,126 --> 0:15:59,447
For our ancestors, where I'm going now


203
0:15:59,447 --> 0:16:1,966
would have been a journey into the unknown.


204
0:16:1,966 --> 0:16:3,687
This is the River Danube,


205
0:16:3,687 --> 0:16:8,126
and today it flows through capital cities like Budapest and vienna.


206
0:16:8,126 --> 0:16:10,326
But 40,000 years ago,


207
0:16:10,326 --> 0:16:14,86
it would have been a gateway to a whole new world.


208
0:16:14,86 --> 0:16:16,807
I'm going to follow our ancestors upstream,


209
0:16:16,807 --> 0:16:37,326
right into the heart of Europe.


210
0:16:37,326 --> 0:16:40,246
North of Istanbul is the Black Sea,


211
0:16:40,246 --> 0:16:42,687
and the mouth of the Danube.


212
0:16:42,687 --> 0:16:45,6
the river runs through Romania,


213
0:16:45,6 --> 0:16:50,966
very close to the Oase cave and the earliest known European.


214
0:16:50,966 --> 0:16:56,206
It looks like those first few colonisers may have been using the Danube


215
0:16:56,206 --> 0:17:8,406
as a super-highway, heading west.


216
0:17:8,406 --> 0:17:12,727
But as they followed the Danube's mighty meandering course,


217
0:17:12,727 --> 0:17:15,7
they were in for a shock.


218
0:17:15,7 --> 0:17:29,646
Something or someone had got there before them.


219
0:17:29,646 --> 0:17:43,7
Europa's descendants weren't entering virgin territory.


220
0:17:43,7 --> 0:17:44,886
For a quarter of a million years,


221
0:17:44,886 --> 0:17:52,606
another species of human had called Europe home.


222
0:17:52,606 --> 0:18:3,166
the Neanderthals.


223
0:18:3,166 --> 0:18:8,686
This is a reconstruction of a man who lived a very long time ago in Italy.


224
0:18:8,686 --> 0:18:12,967
And he's not a modern human, he's a Neanderthal.


225
0:18:12,967 --> 0:18:17,487
And I think when you first look at his face,


226
0:18:17,487 --> 0:18:20,446
the similarities probably strike you more than the differences,


227
0:18:20,446 --> 0:18:23,326
so he looks quite human.


228
0:18:23,326 --> 0:18:26,567
Would you notice him walking along in the street?


229
0:18:26,567 --> 0:18:29,166
But then there are things which do look a bit odd.


230
0:18:29,166 --> 0:18:31,366
The distance between his eyes.


231
0:18:31,366 --> 0:18:33,446
The breadth of his nose, just here.


232
0:18:33,446 --> 0:18:35,527
That looks a bit strange.


233
0:18:35,527 --> 0:18:39,247
And he's got this amazing brow ridge.


234
0:18:39,247 --> 0:18:45,366
It really sticks out over his eyes.


235
0:18:45,366 --> 0:18:48,366
Neanderthals are our distant cousins.


236
0:18:48,366 --> 0:18:50,7
their ancestors reached Europe


237
0:18:50,7 --> 0:18:54,686
hundreds of thousands of years before us.


238
0:18:54,686 --> 0:18:57,47
they spread across a huge region,


239
0:18:57,47 --> 0:19:1,606
from Siberia to Spain.


240
0:19:1,606 --> 0:19:6,406
So when Homo sapiens first arrived around 40,000 years ago,


241
0:19:6,406 --> 0:19:16,406
Europe was already taken.


242
0:19:16,406 --> 0:19:21,247
What were our ancestors up against?


243
0:19:21,247 --> 0:19:34,527
the popular image of Neanderthals is lumbering and slow-witted.


244
0:19:34,527 --> 0:19:37,166
ROBERTS: What do you think they would have thought of each other?


245
0:19:37,166 --> 0:19:40,527
(LAuGHS) I think they would have been really scared of each other.


246
0:19:40,527 --> 0:19:43,366
It's actually very hard to imagine what they would have thought of each other.


247
0:19:43,366 --> 0:19:46,287
I think it would have been a fascinating experience


248
0:19:46,287 --> 0:19:48,926
to watch a sort of contact like that,


249
0:19:48,926 --> 0:19:51,646
between two very closely related species,


250
0:19:51,646 --> 0:19:53,646
that are also clearly very different from each other,


251
0:19:53,646 --> 0:19:57,606
both anatomically, as you can see, but also behaviourally.


252
0:19:57,606 --> 0:20:0,646
And in terms of differences between Neanderthals and modern humans,


253
0:20:0,646 --> 0:20:2,646
is there anything we can say about


254
0:20:2,646 --> 0:20:4,727
how that might have influenced behaviour?


255
0:20:4,727 --> 0:20:7,807
Okay, the one thing to point out is that


256
0:20:7,807 --> 0:20:9,967
Neanderthals were actually sophisticated hunters,


257
0:20:9,967 --> 0:20:11,886
we know that they were top predators.


258
0:20:11,886 --> 0:20:14,527
And actually, they have very large brains -


259
0:20:14,527 --> 0:20:20,86
on average, larger than ours.


260
0:20:20,86 --> 0:20:21,926
ROBERTS: As well as big brains,


261
0:20:21,926 --> 0:20:25,126
the Neanderthals may have had another advantage.


262
0:20:25,126 --> 0:20:30,686
they had been in Europe long enough to adapt to the cold.


263
0:20:30,686 --> 0:20:33,606
their stocky bodies and short limbs


264
0:20:33,606 --> 0:20:36,86
helped them to stay warm.


265
0:20:36,86 --> 0:20:39,807
And that's not all.


266
0:20:39,807 --> 0:20:42,606
This is a reconstructed Neanderthal skeleton,


267
0:20:42,606 --> 0:20:47,287
and generally speaking the skeleton is very similar to ours.


268
0:20:47,287 --> 0:20:48,767
Having said that,


269
0:20:48,767 --> 0:20:50,166
there are definite differences -


270
0:20:50,166 --> 0:20:53,446
the shape of all the bones is subtly different.


271
0:20:53,446 --> 0:20:56,287
And anywhere that muscles attach on this skeleton


272
0:20:56,287 --> 0:21:0,807
is much more prominent than it would be in a modern human.


273
0:21:0,807 --> 0:21:4,366
So this would have been a person who was much more heavily muscled,


274
0:21:4,366 --> 0:21:12,487
generally much more rugged-looking than us today.


275
0:21:12,487 --> 0:21:31,926
they would have been formidable competitors.


276
0:21:31,926 --> 0:21:35,926
The Neanderthals were tougher and better cold-adapted than us,


277
0:21:35,926 --> 0:21:39,807
and some of them even had bigger brains than modern humans.


278
0:21:39,807 --> 0:21:41,207
On the face of it, then,


279
0:21:41,207 --> 0:21:46,567
it seems quite surprising that our species lasted very long at all.


280
0:21:46,567 --> 0:21:53,487
So how did we overcome the Neanderthals?


281
0:21:53,487 --> 0:21:58,207
Maybe our tools and weapons were just better than theirs.


282
0:21:58,207 --> 0:22:6,686
Well, for decades that's exactly what the experts thought.


283
0:22:6,686 --> 0:22:12,967
But this idea hadn't been thoroughly tested - until now.


284
0:22:12,967 --> 0:22:15,7
So how are you doing?


285
0:22:15,7 --> 0:22:16,366
Oh, doing all right.


286
0:22:16,366 --> 0:22:18,846
(ALL SIGH)


287
0:22:18,846 --> 0:22:22,606
ROBERTS: Bruce Bradley and Metin Eren spent over a year


288
0:22:22,606 --> 0:22:29,126
making thousands of basic cutting tools.


289
0:22:29,126 --> 0:22:31,366
ROBERTS: So you've got these two tools, this one


290
0:22:31,366 --> 0:22:33,926
a basic tool made by a Neanderthal,


291
0:22:33,926 --> 0:22:35,967
and this one a basic tool made by a modern human,


292
0:22:35,967 --> 0:22:38,7
-at the same sort of period. -BRuCE: Correct.


293
0:22:38,7 --> 0:22:39,886
Now, they're obviously very different-looking.


294
0:22:39,886 --> 0:22:42,767
This one's long and thin and this one is round.


295
0:22:42,767 --> 0:22:44,287
But are they different in terms of function,


296
0:22:44,287 --> 0:22:46,47
in terms of what they're used for?


297
0:22:46,47 --> 0:22:49,926
They were used for the same kind of tasks. Mostly cutting tasks.


298
0:22:49,926 --> 0:22:52,47
So, for example, I mean, both are really sharp,


299
0:22:52,47 --> 0:22:54,287
if you want to use both of those to cut.


300
0:22:54,287 --> 0:22:55,846
Some pretty thick leather here.


301
0:22:55,846 --> 0:22:57,846
ROBERTS: This is a typical Neanderthal tool?


302
0:22:57,846 --> 0:22:59,606
Exactly. You can see that


303
0:22:59,606 --> 0:23:1,807
it just cuts through this very thick leather very easily.


304
0:23:1,807 --> 0:23:4,326
(LAuGHS) That is incredibly sharp.


305
0:23:4,326 --> 0:23:6,527
METIN: Yes. ROBERTS: Look at that. Wow.


306
0:23:6,527 --> 0:23:9,646
-And this is really tough leather. -That's really effective, isn't it?


307
0:23:9,646 --> 0:23:11,7
ROBERTS: That's brilliant. METIN: Yeah.


308
0:23:11,7 --> 0:23:12,807
BRuCE: Now let's try the blade.


309
0:23:12,807 --> 0:23:14,166
Hold it very carefully, 'cause it's...


310
0:23:14,166 --> 0:23:16,567
ROBERTS: This is the sort of thing that was made by modern humans.


311
0:23:16,567 --> 0:23:21,7
BRuCE: Exactly.


312
0:23:21,7 --> 0:23:23,606
ROBERTS: If anything, I would say that the flake is a bit...


313
0:23:23,606 --> 0:23:26,86
I mean, that's cutting, but just...


314
0:23:26,86 --> 0:23:28,207
You know, just picking up the tool and using it immediately,


315
0:23:28,207 --> 0:23:30,767
I'd say the flake's actually a bit easier to use.


316
0:23:30,767 --> 0:23:33,527
When we created thousands of tools,


317
0:23:33,527 --> 0:23:37,846
we found that the technology of the Neanderthals


318
0:23:37,846 --> 0:23:41,86
actually produced more cutting edge, overall,


319
0:23:41,86 --> 0:23:44,967
it wasted less raw material and you could produce more tools


320
0:23:44,967 --> 0:23:47,567
than the blade cores of the modern Homo sapiens.


321
0:23:47,567 --> 0:23:49,326
I imagine that's very new, isn't it?


322
0:23:49,326 --> 0:23:51,326
It's quite remarkable, because you're telling me


323
0:23:51,326 --> 0:23:54,326
that the Neanderthal technology is just as good,


324
0:23:54,326 --> 0:23:56,807
in fact, if not better than the modern humans'.


325
0:23:56,807 --> 0:23:58,446
I mean, that goes against everything


326
0:23:58,446 --> 0:24:0,807
that people have said for the last few decades.


327
0:24:0,807 --> 0:24:7,646
That's true, and it was a very exciting result.


328
0:24:7,646 --> 0:24:9,646
ROBERTS: It's just one study


329
0:24:9,646 --> 0:24:13,686
on one aspect of tool-making.


330
0:24:13,686 --> 0:24:18,487
But I still think it's important.


331
0:24:18,487 --> 0:24:23,287
This is fascinating, and it means that the long-standing theory


332
0:24:23,287 --> 0:24:29,166
about modern human technology being superior to Neanderthal stone tools


333
0:24:29,166 --> 0:24:40,7
just doesn't stand up.


334
0:24:40,7 --> 0:24:43,247
I want to see if there's another explanation


335
0:24:43,247 --> 0:24:52,886
for why we survived and Neanderthals didn't.


336
0:24:52,886 --> 0:24:55,7
I'm on my way to meet an expert


337
0:24:55,7 --> 0:25:1,207
who thinks the answer may be much less obvious...


338
0:25:1,207 --> 0:25:5,207
Okay, Alice, let's see if I can find everything.


339
0:25:5,207 --> 0:25:13,207
ROBERTS: ...thanks to some discoveries made here in Germany.


340
0:25:13,207 --> 0:25:18,126
This is a very unusual artefact, because it's a flute


341
0:25:18,126 --> 0:25:21,807
and the strange thing about this is, what's really spectacular,


342
0:25:21,807 --> 0:25:24,247
is that it's made of solid mammoth ivory.


343
0:25:24,247 --> 0:25:27,166
It takes between 50 and 100 hours to make one if you know how to do it.


344
0:25:27,166 --> 0:25:29,446
ROBERTS: Yeah. It's been carved down to that shape.


345
0:25:29,446 --> 0:25:33,886
Yes. It really takes talent and, really, genius in the same sense that,


346
0:25:33,886 --> 0:25:37,166
I don't know, a Michelangelo or Rembrandt or something like that.


347
0:25:37,166 --> 0:25:39,767
ROBERTS: So it's the first sign we've had,


348
0:25:39,767 --> 0:25:42,47
the first archaeological evidence we've had


349
0:25:42,47 --> 0:25:43,926
of people making music?


350
0:25:43,926 --> 0:25:46,47
Yeah. Music was a part of their lives


351
0:25:46,47 --> 0:25:48,126
just like it's a part of our lives today.


352
0:25:48,126 --> 0:25:49,727
So what's in here?


353
0:25:49,727 --> 0:25:54,926
Okay. This is a very interesting piece. This is...


354
0:25:54,926 --> 0:25:58,247
the representation


355
0:25:58,247 --> 0:26:1,967
of a phallus. And it's not delicate at all.


356
0:26:1,967 --> 0:26:3,926
-It won't break. You can hold it. -(LAuGHS) All right. Okay.


357
0:26:3,926 --> 0:26:6,207
-And if you look at it, the ring... -Yeah.


358
0:26:6,207 --> 0:26:9,567
NICHOLAS: ...around here, you know, it makes a fairly obvious sexual image.


359
0:26:9,567 --> 0:26:10,807
(LAuGHING) Yeah.


360
0:26:10,807 --> 0:26:14,846
Yeah, one could, you know, easily imagine using it in


361
0:26:14,846 --> 0:26:18,166
-ritual functions, or also... -Yeah.


362
0:26:18,166 --> 0:26:21,727
...you know, straight sexual functions in one form or another.


363
0:26:21,727 --> 0:26:25,406
So do you think this is the first archaeological evidence of smut?


364
0:26:25,406 --> 0:26:27,166
(BOTH CHuCKLE)


365
0:26:27,166 --> 0:26:29,606
I don't know. I wouldn't rule that out.


366
0:26:29,606 --> 0:26:31,7
(BOTH LAuGH)


367
0:26:31,7 --> 0:26:33,247
I can't believe it. I'm an anatomist and you've made me blush


368
0:26:33,247 --> 0:26:37,406
with a bit of prehistoric phallic imagery.


369
0:26:37,406 --> 0:26:45,527
ROBERTS: It seems our ancestors were more like us than we might imagine.


370
0:26:45,527 --> 0:26:48,446
But this doesn't really answer my question.


371
0:26:48,446 --> 0:27:1,166
After all, what use is a flute against a Neanderthal?


372
0:27:1,166 --> 0:27:9,527
Nicholas takes me to see the cave where the artefacts were found.


373
0:27:9,527 --> 0:27:15,846
Our ancestors weren't the only people who lived here.


374
0:27:15,846 --> 0:27:19,47
This is the famous southwest entrance of the cave.


375
0:27:19,47 --> 0:27:22,846
This is actually very close to where the human remains remained,


376
0:27:22,846 --> 0:27:24,807
but there were definitely Neanderthals here.


377
0:27:24,807 --> 0:27:28,366
There are a number of deposits in the lower sediments


378
0:27:28,366 --> 0:27:30,926
made by Neanderthals. So Neanderthals and modern humans


379
0:27:30,926 --> 0:27:32,807
were definitely both here at Fuldevert, which is...


380
0:27:32,807 --> 0:27:34,126
ROBERTS: Both using these caves?


381
0:27:34,126 --> 0:27:35,807
Both using this cave,


382
0:27:35,807 --> 0:27:46,967
but also using a number of other caves in the Lohne valley where we are.


383
0:27:46,967 --> 0:27:52,7
ROBERTS: Many beautiful objects have been found in this region.


384
0:27:52,7 --> 0:27:53,926
Made by our ancestors,


385
0:27:53,926 --> 0:28:1,47
they reveal a crucial difference between us and Neanderthals.


386
0:28:1,47 --> 0:28:3,366
this figure of a lion man


387
0:28:3,366 --> 0:28:6,967
was made around 35,000 years ago.


388
0:28:6,967 --> 0:28:9,86
But it's not a one-off.


389
0:28:9,86 --> 0:28:11,926
Other strikingly similar pieces


390
0:28:11,926 --> 0:28:16,366
have been found in the region.


391
0:28:16,366 --> 0:28:22,446
What's going on here?


392
0:28:22,446 --> 0:28:25,686
The modern humans, here, and for instance in the neighbouring valley


393
0:28:25,686 --> 0:28:29,366
make the exact same artefacts and they are definitely part of the same group.


394
0:28:29,366 --> 0:28:33,7
There's no way that it's chance that you get identical artefacts


395
0:28:33,7 --> 0:28:35,967
at sites, you know, 20, 30, 40 kilometres away.


396
0:28:35,967 --> 0:28:39,166
And that tells us that populations with a shared identity


397
0:28:39,166 --> 0:28:42,166
were fairly large, covering fairly large areas.


398
0:28:42,166 --> 0:28:46,7
presumably interacting, mating with one another, helping each other,


399
0:28:46,7 --> 0:28:50,247
and Neanderthals don't seem to have had that kind of symbolic communication


400
0:28:50,247 --> 0:28:56,527
and seem to have maintained smaller social networks than modern humans.


401
0:28:56,527 --> 0:28:59,326
ROBERTS: So it seems that, unlike Neanderthals,


402
0:28:59,326 --> 0:29:3,446
the scattered tribes of our ancestors were held together


403
0:29:3,446 --> 0:29:13,606
by a strong shared identity.


404
0:29:13,606 --> 0:29:16,926
The great flowering of art suggests


405
0:29:16,926 --> 0:29:21,47
that people were reaching out to each other across the landscape


406
0:29:21,47 --> 0:29:23,646
in a way they'd never done before.


407
0:29:23,646 --> 0:29:27,406
Art wasn't just something they were doing in their spare time.


408
0:29:27,406 --> 0:29:30,47
It was crucial to survival,


409
0:29:30,47 --> 0:29:33,606
a way of marking territory and identity.


410
0:29:33,606 --> 0:29:37,646
A bit like national flags or football shirts today.


411
0:29:37,646 --> 0:29:40,807
And in that competition with the Neanderthals,


412
0:29:40,807 --> 0:29:50,7
it seems that art and what it stood for may have given us the edge.


413
0:29:50,7 --> 0:30:0,727
these links between family groups may have been critical to our success.


414
0:30:0,727 --> 0:30:6,767
And as we advanced, Neanderthals began to retreat...


415
0:30:6,767 --> 0:30:17,967
to the very edge of the continent.


416
0:30:17,967 --> 0:30:26,686
I'm heading to what may have been the last-ever Neanderthal colony.


417
0:30:26,686 --> 0:30:47,446
And I'm hoping to discover why they finally died out.


418
0:30:47,446 --> 0:30:51,247
I'm in Gibraltar, a naval stronghold for centuries,


419
0:30:51,247 --> 0:30:55,606
and new evidence from these rocky shores suggests


420
0:30:55,606 --> 0:30:59,287
that thousands of years after they disappeared from the rest of Europe,


421
0:30:59,287 --> 0:31:3,967
the Neanderthals were clinging on here.


422
0:31:3,967 --> 0:31:9,47
When Neanderthals lived here, sea levels were up to a hundred metres lower,


423
0:31:9,47 --> 0:31:17,326
so much of the evidence from that time could be underwater.


424
0:31:17,326 --> 0:31:22,487
A team of specialists is probing the ocean floor looking for traces


425
0:31:22,487 --> 0:31:27,886
of the Gibraltar Neanderthals.


426
0:31:27,886 --> 0:31:31,686
We've come to a stop now because we are over the archaeological site.


427
0:31:31,686 --> 0:31:35,446
It's about 20 metres below the surface of the sea below us.


428
0:31:35,446 --> 0:31:37,326
The divers are all getting ready,


429
0:31:37,326 --> 0:31:40,166
and these are divers but also archaeologists, so they're going to be


430
0:31:40,166 --> 0:31:49,926
excavating the sea bottom in search of Neanderthals.


431
0:31:49,926 --> 0:31:53,326
these divers are up against poor visibility


432
0:31:53,326 --> 0:31:55,606
with a limited oxygen supply.


433
0:31:55,606 --> 0:32:2,366
Underwater archaeology is always challenging.


434
0:32:2,366 --> 0:32:8,86
But clive Finlayson has already made a series of significant discoveries


435
0:32:8,86 --> 0:32:11,207
in the sea caves nearby.


436
0:32:11,207 --> 0:32:13,686
CLIvE: This is where the last Neanderthals made their last stand,


437
0:32:13,686 --> 0:32:20,646
if you like, 24,000 years ago.


438
0:32:20,646 --> 0:32:22,967
We get the feeling it's the nearest thing to a Neanderthal city


439
0:32:22,967 --> 0:32:24,207
you're gonna find anywhere.


440
0:32:24,207 --> 0:32:28,126
We've got fossils, stone tools, animals that they've been butchering,


441
0:32:28,126 --> 0:32:31,686
all kinds of evidence, hearths, Neanderthal barbecues if you like.


442
0:32:31,686 --> 0:32:41,406
It's a very, very special site.


443
0:32:41,406 --> 0:32:44,926
ROBERTS: they think that Neanderthals may have held on here


444
0:32:44,926 --> 0:32:53,47
long after they'd been wiped out in the rest of Europe.


445
0:32:53,47 --> 0:32:57,606
But after the Neanderthals finally disappeared from Gibraltar,


446
0:32:57,606 --> 0:33:5,366
there was a gap of 5,000 years before we turned up.


447
0:33:5,366 --> 0:33:10,86
So it looks as though whatever finally killed Neanderthals off,


448
0:33:10,86 --> 0:33:14,846
it wasn't us.


449
0:33:14,846 --> 0:33:18,126
What do you think eventually wiped them out?


450
0:33:18,126 --> 0:33:20,446
It may have been a numbers game - there were so few left.


451
0:33:20,446 --> 0:33:23,326
As would happen to populations of endangered species today,


452
0:33:23,326 --> 0:33:25,606
like the panda or the tiger.


453
0:33:25,606 --> 0:33:28,247
Just random fluctuation in numbers can bring it down to zero,


454
0:33:28,247 --> 0:33:30,886
and there's no recovery from zero, so it could've been that.


455
0:33:30,886 --> 0:33:33,727
It could've been disease, in-breeding,


456
0:33:33,727 --> 0:33:36,527
a whole range of factors that can affect a small population


457
0:33:36,527 --> 0:33:38,567
and knock them over the edge.


458
0:33:38,567 --> 0:33:45,767
(BIRDS SQUAWKING)


459
0:33:45,767 --> 0:33:49,807
I find it very moving to think that one day the last Neanderthal


460
0:33:49,807 --> 0:33:54,126
might have been sitting here, staring out to sea


461
0:33:54,126 --> 0:33:57,567
and perhaps waiting for their companions to return.


462
0:33:57,567 --> 0:34:2,247
Or maybe he or she knew that they were the last of their tribe or their family.


463
0:34:2,247 --> 0:34:5,487
But they can't have known that they were the last


464
0:34:5,487 --> 0:34:12,646
of their entire species.


465
0:34:12,646 --> 0:34:17,967
So that was the end of the Neanderthals.


466
0:34:17,967 --> 0:34:22,487
Or was it?


467
0:34:22,487 --> 0:34:25,646
Some scientists believe their descendants


468
0:34:25,646 --> 0:34:30,967
are still walking around today.


469
0:34:30,967 --> 0:34:34,166
If our ancestors interbred with them,


470
0:34:34,166 --> 0:34:41,126
some of us could be part Neanderthal.


471
0:34:41,126 --> 0:34:45,567
Obviously to Neanderthals, a fine Neanderthal man must have been


472
0:34:45,567 --> 0:34:47,606
very handsome to a Neanderthal woman.


473
0:34:47,606 --> 0:34:51,606
And a Neanderthal woman, despite her massive brows and very chunky face,


474
0:34:51,606 --> 0:34:55,447
must have looked wonderful to a Neanderthal man.


475
0:34:55,447 --> 0:34:58,7
But I think we look at them and think they look,


476
0:34:58,7 --> 0:35:1,927
I don't know, yeah, just a bit ugly.


477
0:35:1,927 --> 0:35:5,606
I don't think it would've even crossed my mind to fancy


478
0:35:5,606 --> 0:35:11,726
or perhaps mate with a Neanderthal.


479
0:35:11,726 --> 0:35:16,606
It seems our ancestors felt the same way as me.


480
0:35:16,606 --> 0:35:20,646
Researchers are now sequencing the Neanderthal genome,


481
0:35:20,646 --> 0:35:25,487
using DNA from bones tens of thousands of years old,


482
0:35:25,487 --> 0:35:29,606
and comparing it with our own.


483
0:35:29,606 --> 0:35:35,847
And so far there's no sign of any interbreeding.


484
0:35:35,847 --> 0:35:40,47
Neanderthals really did die out,


485
0:35:40,47 --> 0:36:2,887
and Europe was ours.


486
0:36:2,887 --> 0:36:9,407
Soon descendants of the first pioneers would be joined by new arrivals.


487
0:36:9,407 --> 0:36:12,927
About 100% of Europeans living today are descended


488
0:36:12,927 --> 0:36:17,47
from those ancient pioneers who shared the continent with the Neanderthals.


489
0:36:17,47 --> 0:36:18,367
But what about the rest of us?


490
0:36:18,367 --> 0:36:22,646
Well, our genes tell us that after the Neanderthals disappeared


491
0:36:22,646 --> 0:36:26,246
there was a second big wave of colonisation into Europe,


492
0:36:26,246 --> 0:36:32,206
and some of us appear to be descended from that wave.


493
0:36:32,206 --> 0:36:37,286
I'd like to know where I fit in this story.


494
0:36:37,286 --> 0:36:41,407
I've taken a genetic test.


495
0:36:41,407 --> 0:36:43,646
Something anyone can do.


496
0:36:43,646 --> 0:36:47,646
It should be possible for me to find out if I can trace my DNA


497
0:36:47,646 --> 0:36:50,166
all the way back to Europa,


498
0:36:50,166 --> 0:36:57,967
or whether my ancestors arrived much later.


499
0:36:57,967 --> 0:37:1,527
So I've got the results back of my DNA analysis


500
0:37:1,527 --> 0:37:3,527
and they look extraordinarily complicated,


501
0:37:3,527 --> 0:37:8,447
even though this is actually only a tiny fragment of my genetic code.


502
0:37:8,447 --> 0:37:13,847
And I've also got the genetic code for Europe's first lady, Europa,


503
0:37:13,847 --> 0:37:20,206
here in front of me, so I can compare our DNA sequences.


504
0:37:20,206 --> 0:37:31,126
At first sight we seem identical.


505
0:37:31,126 --> 0:37:33,487
But when you look really carefully,


506
0:37:33,487 --> 0:37:35,806
there are some differences.


507
0:37:35,806 --> 0:37:42,527
they may be tiny, but they're crucial.


508
0:37:42,527 --> 0:37:45,806
So this means I'm not descended from Europa.


509
0:37:45,806 --> 0:37:51,86
And in fact these mutations tell me that I'm descended


510
0:37:51,86 --> 0:37:59,86
from another European founding mother.


511
0:37:59,86 --> 0:38:1,847
Some have called this woman Iris,


512
0:38:1,847 --> 0:38:6,927
and her descendants may have been part of a new wave into Europe


513
0:38:6,927 --> 0:38:12,606
around 25,000 years ago.


514
0:38:12,606 --> 0:38:15,606
People that seem to have come from the east,


515
0:38:15,606 --> 0:38:25,646
bringing a new culture with them.


516
0:38:25,646 --> 0:38:29,166
I've come to the Czech Republic,


517
0:38:29,166 --> 0:38:32,927
to the small village of Doln/' Vestonice,


518
0:38:32,927 --> 0:38:38,887
famous for some big archaeological discoveries.


519
0:38:38,887 --> 0:38:50,166
So what do they reveal about this new culture?


520
0:38:50,166 --> 0:38:51,527
ROBERTS: Oh, that's beautiful.


521
0:38:51,527 --> 0:38:56,527
So, we've got several tusks like this in Central and Eastern Europe


522
0:38:56,527 --> 0:39:0,527
which always have a very complex type of engraving.


523
0:39:0,527 --> 0:39:3,927
And one thing that could be suggested


524
0:39:3,927 --> 0:39:7,246
is that this thing could be a meandering river.


525
0:39:7,246 --> 0:39:8,367
ROBERTS: Right.


526
0:39:8,367 --> 0:39:14,7
The way how the tusk is decorated could have had some sort of a meaning,


527
0:39:14,7 --> 0:39:18,806
like accessibility of the field or good for hunting, bad for hunting,


528
0:39:18,806 --> 0:39:22,286
you can push mammoth through or you cannot.


529
0:39:22,286 --> 0:39:24,367
-ROBERTS: So it's a map? -A kind of a map.


530
0:39:24,367 --> 0:39:28,206
And the whole strategy of an action could be planned


531
0:39:28,206 --> 0:39:36,86
on a piece of ivory like that.


532
0:39:36,86 --> 0:39:40,567
ROBERTS: We'll never know for sure if it was a map.


533
0:39:40,567 --> 0:39:49,126
But other artefacts found here are much more significant.


534
0:39:49,126 --> 0:39:53,967
this is the Venus of Doln/' Vestonice.


535
0:39:53,967 --> 0:40:6,47
One of the earliest pieces of pottery in the world.


536
0:40:6,47 --> 0:40:10,967
But the really exciting thing is that other Venus figurines


537
0:40:10,967 --> 0:40:18,726
have been unearthed all over the continent.


538
0:40:18,726 --> 0:40:22,47
What this means is that for the first time


539
0:40:22,47 --> 0:40:29,606
people shared a distinct culture right across Europe.


540
0:40:29,606 --> 0:40:32,86
But in the next few thousand years


541
0:40:32,86 --> 0:40:35,327
our European ancestors would face a threat


542
0:40:35,327 --> 0:40:39,86
that would almost wipe them out.

Animals disappeared from the landscape and the ground froze over.

Our ancestors couldn't survive in these Arctic conditions.

By 24,000 years ago, Britain was uninhabitable,

This is the vezere valley in the Dordogne.


555
0:41:43,7 --> 0:41:45,847
During the last Ice Age, the hills around here


556
0:41:45,847 --> 0:41:48,527
would have been bound tight by frost.


557
0:41:48,527 --> 0:41:51,407
And with wind chill, the temperature up there


558
0:41:51,407 --> 0:41:55,726
could be as much as 20 degrees colder than down here in the valley,


559
0:41:55,726 --> 0:42:0,7
where a warmish micro-climate meant life could go on,


560
0:42:0,7 --> 0:42:3,766
and small bands of hunter-gatherers would've huddled together


561
0:42:3,766 --> 0:42:12,927
to survive the long, bitter winters.


562
0:42:12,927 --> 0:42:20,967
But they may not have survived at all, had it not been for this...


563
0:42:20,967 --> 0:42:28,246
the rock shelters and caves that riddle the landscape.


564
0:42:28,246 --> 0:42:35,927
And deep underground, they left something that we still marvel at today.


565
0:42:35,927 --> 0:43:7,686
(WATER DRIPPING)


566
0:43:7,686 --> 0:43:12,246
I'm in a cave called pech Merle, which is stunningly beautiful naturally,


567
0:43:12,246 --> 0:43:16,806
but look at this - this is real artistic expression.


568
0:43:16,806 --> 0:43:21,327
Something that defines us and sets us apart as a species.


569
0:43:21,327 --> 0:43:23,166
And pech Merle is unusual,


570
0:43:23,166 --> 0:43:26,567
because artists were coming here to paint these images


571
0:43:26,567 --> 0:43:30,806
both before and after the peak of the last Ice Age,


572
0:43:30,806 --> 0:43:33,806
generations of them returning to the cave


573
0:43:33,806 --> 0:43:39,726
as the world outside froze over.


574
0:43:39,726 --> 0:43:45,327
This is a very beautiful image and it uses the contours of the rock.


575
0:43:45,327 --> 0:43:49,567
The horse's back sort of curves along a bulge in the rock


576
0:43:49,567 --> 0:43:53,527
and there's an echo of the horse's head on this right side there.


577
0:43:53,527 --> 0:43:56,606
And it's obviously a very stylised horse as well.


578
0:43:56,606 --> 0:43:59,806
And I love the way those spots carry on into the background,


579
0:43:59,806 --> 0:44:4,367
as though the horse is sort of camouflaged against the rock.


580
0:44:4,367 --> 0:44:8,327
And there's a hand placed against the rock just above the horse's back.


581
0:44:8,327 --> 0:44:11,887
I mean, that is amazing, isn't it? That's an Ice Age hand.


582
0:44:11,887 --> 0:44:17,726
(SpUTTERING)


583
0:44:17,726 --> 0:44:23,286
Michel Lorblanchet has devoted his life to studying the art found in caves


584
0:44:23,286 --> 0:44:24,686
like Pech Merle.


585
0:44:24,686 --> 0:44:35,246
(SpUTTERING)


586
0:44:35,246 --> 0:44:39,246
I think I naively imagined that you just take a mouthful of charcoal,


587
0:44:39,246 --> 0:44:42,567
a bit of water and just spit it at the wall and that'd be it.


588
0:44:42,567 --> 0:44:44,967
But of course all that would happen would be that the mess


589
0:44:44,967 --> 0:44:48,927
would run down the wall and obscure the stencil that you were trying to do.


590
0:44:48,927 --> 0:44:52,126
So you have to do it like this, using an almost dry mouth,


591
0:44:52,126 --> 0:45:3,726
and just building it up very gradually with a fine spray.


592
0:45:3,726 --> 0:45:7,246
Michel Lorblanchet did a recreation of the horses at pech Merle


593
0:45:7,246 --> 0:45:10,447
using this technique. It took him a whole week.


594
0:45:10,447 --> 0:45:12,86
-Is it finished? -Yes...


595
0:45:12,86 --> 0:45:15,367
-It's finished. -Yes. That's right.


596
0:45:15,367 --> 0:45:21,447
ROBERTS: But what drove these people, struggling just to survive, to paint?


597
0:45:21,447 --> 0:45:25,246
The vast majority of these images seem to be animals,


598
0:45:25,246 --> 0:45:28,487
there don't seem to be many representations of humans.


599
0:45:28,487 --> 0:45:32,686
No, that's true, they are mainly animal figures.


600
0:45:32,686 --> 0:45:38,367
And for them, of course, animals were not only game,


601
0:45:38,367 --> 0:45:41,86
but also spirits, symbolic,


602
0:45:41,86 --> 0:45:45,447
so the animal figures are, in fact, symbolic figures.


603
0:45:45,447 --> 0:45:49,47
And going into pech Merle, I mean, it's such a beautiful cave


604
0:45:49,47 --> 0:45:51,246
with all the stalactites hanging down


605
0:45:51,246 --> 0:45:56,246
and it does feel as though it was, I don't know, almost a temple.


606
0:45:56,246 --> 0:45:59,47
Yes, that's right, this is a natural temple, if you like.


607
0:45:59,47 --> 0:46:1,606
They are sacred sites.


608
0:46:1,606 --> 0:46:4,766
They are not painting just for fun.


609
0:46:4,766 --> 0:46:8,927
By painting a cave and having a sanctuary,


610
0:46:8,927 --> 0:46:15,286
it is a way for them to say, ''Here is our sacred place.''


611
0:46:15,286 --> 0:46:22,646
The painted cave is symbolic of the whole tribe.


612
0:46:22,646 --> 0:46:25,447
ROBERTS: Being bound together in this way


613
0:46:25,447 --> 0:46:28,7
may have helped our ancestors survive


614
0:46:28,7 --> 0:46:36,487
the kind of climate change that only haunts our imaginations today.


615
0:46:36,487 --> 0:46:40,286
(WIND BLOWING)


616
0:46:40,286 --> 0:46:45,327
Nearly two thirds of modern Europeans can trace their lineages back


617
0:46:45,327 --> 0:46:55,606
to ancestors who held on in those southern refuges.


618
0:46:55,606 --> 0:46:58,686
It would be more than 1 00 generations


619
0:46:58,686 --> 0:47:7,86
before the world would begin to warm again.


620
0:47:7,86 --> 0:47:11,327
And it may have been around this time that something happened


621
0:47:11,327 --> 0:47:15,967
which would stamp a new identity on the Europeans.


622
0:47:15,967 --> 0:47:18,766
Since the birth of our species in Africa,


623
0:47:18,766 --> 0:47:22,847
our ancestors' skin had almost certainly been dark,


624
0:47:22,847 --> 0:47:26,606
protection against the tropical sun.


625
0:47:26,606 --> 0:47:34,606
But why in Europe did it turn from brown to white?


626
0:47:34,606 --> 0:47:39,967
the surprising answer may lie with a single vitamin.


627
0:47:39,967 --> 0:47:42,407
Vitamin D.


628
0:47:42,407 --> 0:47:45,646
A lack of vitamin D may not sound particularly significant,


629
0:47:45,646 --> 0:47:48,367
but it can be life-threatening.


630
0:47:48,367 --> 0:47:50,646
It can wreak havoc with a growing skeleton,


631
0:47:50,646 --> 0:47:54,166
causing bones to grow bent and misshapen.


632
0:47:54,166 --> 0:47:57,766
These are all skeletons of patients with rickets,


633
0:47:57,766 --> 0:48:0,286
and you can see how it's affected the bones.


634
0:48:0,286 --> 0:48:5,286
These leg bones here are all curved, making walking difficult.


635
0:48:5,286 --> 0:48:9,887
And the chest is deformed, so breathing would be problematic as well.


636
0:48:9,887 --> 0:48:14,327
And not only that, rickets can affect your chance of having children.


637
0:48:14,327 --> 0:48:17,967
This is the pelvis of a woman who had rickets.


638
0:48:17,967 --> 0:48:21,726
And you can see the way that the pelvic bones have collapsed together.


639
0:48:21,726 --> 0:48:25,606
You just could not get a baby's head through this space.


640
0:48:25,606 --> 0:48:32,686
It would've been impossible for her to give birth naturally.


641
0:48:32,686 --> 0:48:35,367
So vitamin D is vital


642
0:48:35,367 --> 0:48:40,166
and we make it in our skin in the presence of sunlight.


643
0:48:40,166 --> 0:48:42,927
But dark skin blocks out the sun,


644
0:48:42,927 --> 0:48:47,847
and in Europe, with its weaker sunlight, this could've been a problem.


645
0:48:47,847 --> 0:48:52,686
Our ancestors may have struggled to make enough vitamin D.


646
0:48:52,686 --> 0:49:5,527
So this could be why Europeans turned white.


647
0:49:5,527 --> 0:49:8,527
But this change in skin colour was nothing


648
0:49:8,527 --> 0:49:18,686
compared with the massive upheaval approaching.


649
0:49:18,686 --> 0:49:20,927
I'm heading back to turkey,


650
0:49:20,927 --> 0:49:25,686
because a recent discovery here shows that after the Ice Age,


651
0:49:25,686 --> 0:49:29,527
our ancestors abandoned their way of life,


652
0:49:29,527 --> 0:49:38,847
one they had followed since our species first appeared in Africa.


653
0:49:38,847 --> 0:49:52,887
And what happened here still defines our world today.


654
0:49:52,887 --> 0:49:58,527
this final stage of my European journey leads to a remote hillside


655
0:49:58,527 --> 0:50:4,847
in the far south of the country.


656
0:50:4,847 --> 0:50:7,927
This is Gobekli Tepe,


657
0:50:7,927 --> 0:50:16,686
an extraordinary site that I'm just incredibly excited to look at.


658
0:50:16,686 --> 0:50:18,86
Hi. Alice.


659
0:50:18,86 --> 0:50:19,606
-Are you Klaus Schmidt? -Nice to meet you.


660
0:50:19,606 --> 0:50:20,967
Hello. I'm Alice Roberts.


661
0:50:20,967 --> 0:50:22,967
(LAuGHS) I heard from your visit. Yeah.


662
0:50:22,967 --> 0:50:24,927
Nice to meet you here in Gobekli Tepe.


663
0:50:24,927 --> 0:50:26,686
I'm so excited about coming here.


664
0:50:26,686 --> 0:50:28,567
It's such an amazing discovery you've made.


665
0:50:28,567 --> 0:50:30,246
It's amazing, that's true, that's very true.


666
0:50:30,246 --> 0:50:32,47
-You seem very excited. -I just this season


667
0:50:32,47 --> 0:50:33,646
we have a lot of new findings.


668
0:50:33,646 --> 0:50:53,487
-So it's worth to have a look. -Oh, come on then, let's have a look.


669
0:50:53,487 --> 0:50:57,887
ROBERTS: Gobekli tepe is 12,000 years old,


670
0:50:57,887 --> 0:51:3,487
over twice as old as the pyramids.


671
0:51:3,487 --> 0:51:9,166
Already, Klaus has found dozens of standing stones,


672
0:51:9,166 --> 0:51:17,166
each one carved with mysterious symbols.


673
0:51:17,166 --> 0:51:22,766
these stone circles are possibly the oldest purpose-built temples


674
0:51:22,766 --> 0:51:31,806
in the world.


675
0:51:31,806 --> 0:51:36,246
KLAuS: Sometimes, there are arms and hands and fingers depicted.


676
0:51:36,246 --> 0:51:41,166
So it's very clear that the T part is a human head in profile


677
0:51:41,166 --> 0:51:45,286
and the shaft of the pillar is the human body.


678
0:51:45,286 --> 0:51:49,47
Here we have an example of the depiction of an arm


679
0:51:49,47 --> 0:51:51,567
which is going down here, and the fingers.


680
0:51:51,567 --> 0:51:54,47
The hand and the fingers are not excavated yet,


681
0:51:54,47 --> 0:51:58,487
but it's clear they will appear when we continue to work here.


682
0:51:58,487 --> 0:52:2,47
So we've got a circle of smaller T-shaped pillars


683
0:52:2,47 --> 0:52:4,246
and then two enormous ones in the centre.


684
0:52:4,246 --> 0:52:7,606
It's always the same, there are two in the centre which are very big


685
0:52:7,606 --> 0:52:11,726
and free-standing, surrounded by smaller but similar ones.


686
0:52:11,726 --> 0:52:13,527
And we understand it as a meeting,


687
0:52:13,527 --> 0:52:25,527
as a gathering of these beings made of stone.


688
0:52:25,527 --> 0:52:28,606
Here now, we have the most interesting reliefs.


689
0:52:28,606 --> 0:52:29,686
ROBERTS: Oh, wow.


690
0:52:29,686 --> 0:52:33,327
KLAuS: Ibis, snake and a vulture.


691
0:52:33,327 --> 0:52:36,47
It's a story illustrated by these animals,


692
0:52:36,47 --> 0:52:38,206
and this story is not a peaceful one.


693
0:52:38,206 --> 0:52:40,367
A scorpion, snake, and so on.


694
0:52:40,367 --> 0:52:43,686
Our model for the function of all this installation is


695
0:52:43,686 --> 0:52:46,567
they have been made for burial reasons.


696
0:52:46,567 --> 0:52:50,407
To bring the dead bodies to open places


697
0:52:50,407 --> 0:52:53,126
and the vultures are eating the flesh and other birds.


698
0:52:53,126 --> 0:52:56,166
So you think this might have been a site for these sky burials?


699
0:52:56,166 --> 0:52:58,166
-KLAuS: Yes, yes... -Where people are left out in the open


700
0:52:58,166 --> 0:53:0,86
to be picked clean by vultures.


701
0:53:0,86 --> 0:53:1,927
-KLAuS: Yes... -And these are the vultures?


702
0:53:1,927 --> 0:53:3,407
KLAuS: (LAuGHS) These are the vultures, yeah.


703
0:53:3,407 --> 0:53:5,407
ROBERTS: It almost looks like hieroglyphics.


704
0:53:5,407 --> 0:53:14,7
Maybe pre-hieroglyphic messages or Stone Age hieroglyphics.


705
0:53:14,7 --> 0:53:18,927
ROBERTS: Klaus is anxious to show me his most spectacular discovery.


706
0:53:18,927 --> 0:53:20,327
KLAuS: And here we found...


707
0:53:20,327 --> 0:53:21,447
(ROBERTS EXCLAIMS)


708
0:53:21,447 --> 0:53:23,166
...this nice animal.


709
0:53:23,166 --> 0:53:26,766
This is incredibly beautiful, I mean, this is sculpture.


710
0:53:26,766 --> 0:53:28,286
-It's not just a relief, is it? -Yeah, yeah, sure.


711
0:53:28,286 --> 0:53:29,726
ROBERTS: It's wonderful. KLAuS: Yes, clearly,


712
0:53:29,726 --> 0:53:32,447
it's a masterpiece of work.


713
0:53:32,447 --> 0:53:36,527
ROBERTS: It makes you rethink the Stone Age, doesn't it? I mean, it...


714
0:53:36,527 --> 0:53:39,407
You tend to think of hunter-gatherers as being, I don't know,


715
0:53:39,407 --> 0:53:41,927
fairly crude in some ways,


716
0:53:41,927 --> 0:53:46,806
and not necessarily capable of producing artefacts that beautiful.


717
0:53:46,806 --> 0:53:50,7
It's clear that these societies had specialists


718
0:53:50,7 --> 0:53:51,806
for stone-working, at least.


719
0:53:51,806 --> 0:53:55,686
So, really, people who didn't do anything else, as to produce sculptures


720
0:53:55,686 --> 0:53:57,646
and pillars and reliefs from stone.


721
0:53:57,646 --> 0:53:59,487
These are such exciting finds, aren't they?


722
0:53:59,487 --> 0:54:3,327
KLAuS: Yeah.


723
0:54:3,327 --> 0:54:8,367
ROBERTS: this place suggests a society that could support specialist craftsmen


724
0:54:8,367 --> 0:54:13,7
and perhaps even a priesthood.


725
0:54:13,7 --> 0:54:16,887
It was the beginning of a totally new way of life.


726
0:54:16,887 --> 0:54:18,927
KLAuS: These are sites of settled hunters.


727
0:54:18,927 --> 0:54:21,646
So it was a high culture of hunters here,


728
0:54:21,646 --> 0:54:25,407
which was nearly exploding in the tenth millennium,


729
0:54:25,407 --> 0:54:28,327
so it's still a hunter-gatherer society in its structures,


730
0:54:28,327 --> 0:54:30,927
and its buildings, its monuments.


731
0:54:30,927 --> 0:54:33,447
ROBERTS: But there was another very important difference


732
0:54:33,447 --> 0:54:37,887
between these hunter-gatherers and any of their predecessors.


733
0:54:37,887 --> 0:54:43,806
they were settling down, abandoning their nomadic lifestyle.


734
0:54:43,806 --> 0:54:50,606
A huge shift, which would help spark a Europe-wide revolution.


735
0:54:50,606 --> 0:54:59,407
And the evidence for this can be found growing in the surrounding fields.


736
0:54:59,407 --> 0:55:3,166
Locked inside this single stalk of wheat


737
0:55:3,166 --> 0:55:7,447
is a story of how the world was transformed.


738
0:55:7,447 --> 0:55:12,7
Geneticists have analysed DNA from domesticated wheat varieties


739
0:55:12,7 --> 0:55:15,766
from across the world, and the staggering thing is


740
0:55:15,766 --> 0:55:25,726
they can all be traced back to grasses which originally grew in this area.


741
0:55:25,726 --> 0:55:32,367
Which means that farming as we know it in Europe was born around here.


742
0:55:32,367 --> 0:55:36,447
communities settled down and populations expanded.


743
0:55:36,447 --> 0:55:42,766
this could've driven the need to start producing food.


744
0:55:42,766 --> 0:55:50,327
And as farming spread, the landscape was transformed.


745
0:55:50,327 --> 0:55:55,407
Forests were cleared and villages, then towns,


746
0:55:55,407 --> 0:55:59,527
then cities would grow,


747
0:55:59,527 --> 0:56:3,726
founded by descendants of the small groups of pioneers


748
0:56:3,726 --> 0:56:11,766
who first entered Europe around 45,000 years ago.


749
0:56:11,766 --> 0:56:16,606
those early Europeans were people just like you and me.


750
0:56:16,606 --> 0:56:24,726
But it is humbling when you see the challenges they faced.


751
0:56:24,726 --> 0:56:29,47
they overcame the competition from Neanderthals


752
0:56:29,47 --> 0:56:34,967
and made it through the Ice Age.


753
0:56:34,967 --> 0:56:38,126
In fact, at the time it wasn't at all inevitable


754
0:56:38,126 --> 0:56:42,887
that my ancestors, maybe yours, would've even survived.


755
0:56:42,887 --> 0:56:46,806
And it makes me wonder what would happen if today's Europeans


756
0:56:46,806 --> 0:56:50,567
were faced by such a harsh changing climate.


757
0:56:50,567 --> 0:56:52,606
But having taken this long view,


758
0:56:52,606 --> 0:56:56,927
we've seen how ingenious and adaptable we are as a species.


759
0:56:56,927 --> 0:57:0,646
And it gives me hope that we will be able to survive the changes


760
0:57:0,646 --> 0:59:0,646
of millennia to come.
