###0 EDDIE HUANG: Somebody's gotta get pregnant on this show.
###2 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Pregnant?
###2 EDDIE HUANG: Somebody's gotta get pregnant.
###4 This is the somebody-- did he tell you?
###6 This is Vice Media.
###8 Somebody's gotta get pregnant.
###10 We go to different ethnic
###11 neighborhoods, and we make babies.
###14 That's what we do.
###15 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: You'd have a cute baby.
###16 Cute baby.
###17 EDDIE HUANG: Cute.
###17 I mean, that could be a baby.
###19 I could see this baby.
###20 10 points.
###22 There we go.
###23 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###44 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, I was mad excited about Persian LA.
###47 Came out here, thought I'd run into the Iron Sheik at the
###49 grocery store, cop some plutonium on the corner, catch
###53 an afternoon saffron rainstorm.
###55 
###65 What's up?
###67 All right, so when you lost in Persian LA, head to the
###70 fucking rug store, find your neighborhood friendly Persian.
###73 This is Nima Nabavi, world famous.
###76 NIMA NABAVI: Pleasure.
###77 EDDIE HUANG: Thank you for showing us around this
###79 neighborhood.
###80 
###83 So what is it that makes Persian rugs so special?
###86 NIMA NABAVI: The main thing is a lot of them take like 10
###89 years to make.
###90 EDDIE HUANG: One rug?
###91 NIMA NABAVI: Yeah, one rug.
###92 EDDIE HUANG: So this was a dude's decade?
###94 How much is one of these?
###96 NIMA NABAVI: Honestly, if this was under 25 grand, I'd be
###98 kind of surprised.
###99 EDDIE HUANG: This is a car.
###100 NIMA NABAVI: We'll ask them.
###101 EDDIE HUANG: This is college.
###102 NIMA NABAVI: Yeah.
###102 EDDIE HUANG: Wow.
###103 NIMA NABAVI: This is a big deal.
###104 EDDIE HUANG: I'ma get on this rug game, because a lot of
###107 people got the sneaker game, the cars.
###109 NIMA NABAVI: The rug game's where it's at, man.
###110 EDDIE HUANG: Wanna be futuristic
###111 with your pimp game?
###112 Rugs.
###113 Persian rugs.
###114 Are those peacocks?
###115 Or phoenix?
###116 What bird is-- what is like the bird?
###118 NIMA NABAVI: They're big cocks, because that's what
###119 we're known for.
###119 EDDIE HUANG: Oh wow.
###120 Pause.
###121 So this is like a car dealership, like somebody
###123 sells a rug, like a $25,000 rug, that's their month?
###126 NIMA NABAVI: Yeah.
###127 EDDIE HUANG: They don't got no doughnuts in here, though, no
###129 doughnuts and coffee?
###130 NIMA NABAVI: Naw, they got baklava and tea.
###132 EDDIE HUANG: What is the food in this neighborhood, though?
###134 NIMA NABAVI: I mean, generally, the stereotype is
###136 kebab and rice and all that, which is dope.
###138 EDDIE HUANG: I seen it.
###138 NIMA NABAVI: But I want to take you to this spot that is
###141 a sandwich spot.
###142 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###147 NIMA NABAVI: This area is officially Persian Square, and
###149 they picked this spot because the sandwich shop we're about
###152 to go to is the first Persian establishment in the area.
###155 EDDIE HUANG: Nice.
###155 NIMA NABAVI: So, been around since '74, so
###158 let's go peep it out.
###159 
###165 EDDIE HUANG: They got the brain out on front
###167 street, you see this?
###168 What kind of brain is that, cow brain?
###170 NIMA NABAVI: Sheep.
###171 EDDIE HUANG: I think you should hit the brain, I'm
###173 gonna get the tongue.
###173 NIMA NABAVI: Try a little bit, though.
###174 EDDIE HUANG: I'll try a little bit.
###176 
###183 WAITRESS: Here's your brain.
###184 NIMA NABAVI: That's the brains, and two tongues.
###186 WAITRESS: Yes.
###189 NIMA NABAVI: What do you think?
###189 EDDIE HUANG: Delicious.
###190 Tender.
###190 NIMA NABAVI: Yeah, right?
###191 EDDIE HUANG: This tongue feels like I'm at Second
###193 Avenue Deli, man.
###194 Like really, really juicy.
###196 NIMA NABAVI: Legit, right?
###196 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###197 And the pickles, these types of pickles that you get in
###200 like Lebanese food, Persian food.
###202 It's like the tarter, sour, funky, thin pickles.
###208 NIMA NABAVI: You know, it's almost time
###210 for the brain, right?
###211 
###213 EDDIE HUANG: You first, kid.
###215 You know what brain looks like to me?
###217 It's like mammal oysters.
###218 NIMA NABAVI: It really is.
###218 EDDIE HUANG: Not even gonna front.
###220 I do it for y'all.
###221 NIMA NABAVI: You'll only be eating brain sandwiches for
###223 the rest of your life.
###224 Watch.
###225 
###229 EDDIE HUANG: Here's the thing, this is it
###229 with all the gag foods.
###230 I have no problem eating it-- sweetbreads, whatever.
###233 My thing is just it's never, like, amazing.
###236 NIMA NABAVI: That's what I'm saying.
###236 EDDIE HUANG: It's never eventful.
###237 I'm like, this is all hype.
###238 And that's why I don't bug out over freak food.
###242 NIMA NABAVI: Well, a lot of it, too, is a lot of these
###245 cultures, it was really like--
###246 EDDIE HUANG: They enjoy it.
###247 NIMA NABAVI: Well, it's not even that.
###248 It's like, we kill the sheep, and we eat every part of it.
###251 Like, my dad will come here and swear he loves it.
###255 EDDIE HUANG: What do you got next?
###256 NIMA NABAVI: Yo, next up, we're gonna go have some real
###257 Persian ice cream, man.
###258 EDDIE HUANG: Dope.

###262 NIMA NABAVI: Alright, man.
###263 
###268 EDDIE HUANG: I see the saffron.
###269 I'm getting saffron, I already decided.
###271 NIMA NABAVI: Did you?
###272 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###272 All right, we'll try this frozen, high fiber sorbet.
###275 NIMA NABAVI: There ya go.
###276 EDDIE HUANG: Can I do it with the flavors, like I put
###278 together or not?
###279 ICE CREAM SERVER: Oh yeah, that's how it
###279 comes is this way.
###281 EDDIE HUANG: Oh, good.
###282 Are a lot of Persians lactose intolerant?
###284 NIMA NABAVI: Yup.
###284 EDDIE HUANG: Because that is an epidemic in my
###287 neighborhood--
###287 the milk farters.
###289 Lot of milk farters in Chinatown.
###291 Thank you, sir.
###292 NIMA NABAVI: Thank you, [FARSI].
###293 Oh, you're going to grow a unibrow right now.
###295 
###299 EDDIE HUANG: I think my dick just got bigger.
###301 This is like y'all's shark's fin.
###303 NIMA NABAVI: Yeah.
###303 EDDIE HUANG: You know what I mean?
###305 Score 1,500, grandpa will take you out for
###307 some saffron ice cream.
###308 NIMA NABAVI: There ya go.
###310 EDDIE HUANG: Yo, so we ate sandwiches, we looked at rugs.
###315 NIMA NABAVI: True.
###315 EDDIE HUANG: We ate ice cream.
###317 NIMA NABAVI: Yes, sir.
###318 EDDIE HUANG: How would a Persian end this?
###319 NIMA NABAVI: Definitely gotta have some hookah.
###321 EDDIE HUANG: OK.
###321 NIMA NABAVI: So there's a spot up here, it's
###323 called Habibi Cafe.
###325 We should go up there, meet some homies, and fucking get
###327 some smoking.
###328 EDDIE HUANG: OK.
###329 
###338 Eddie, nice to meet you.
###340 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Edgar.
###340 EDDIE HUANG: Eddie.
###341 You're Edgar?
###342 You're Edgar.
###344 Amazing.
###344 Sexy.
###345 This is nice, I like this.
###346 I like this.
###350 Where're you from?
###351 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: We're all Persian.
###351 EDDIE HUANG: All Persian.
###353 I'm glad you all came, because otherwise, these Vice viewers
###355 would've thought all Persians were dudes
###357 with unibrows, right?
###358 NIMA NABAVI: Yeah.
###359 EDDIE HUANG: Pretty much.
###360 
###367 Oh wow.
###368 He did put milk in the base.
###370 NIMA NABAVI: I told you.
###371 EDDIE HUANG: Oh, it's an apple.
###374 I did that in high school when I couldn't buy pipes.
###376 
###380 We were like, what do Persians do?
###382 And he was like, meet me at the rug shop, then we're going
###385 to go peep sandwiches, then we're gonna eat ice cream.
###388 I was like, dude.
###388 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Ok, those are three things I've never
###389 done in my life.
###391 EDDIE HUANG: We went to Persian LA.
###392 It's like a good three to five blocks, but it's really like a
###395 bookstore, a music store, an ice cream shop, a rug shop, a
###400 sandwich shop.
###401 You know, a collection of business is not
###403 necessarily a community.
###404 You need the people in there.
###406 You need the vigor, you need the energy, you need the
###408 sounds, you need the flavors.
###409 
###412 You wish that this culture would plant their flag a
###415 little deeper in LA.
###417 
###425 Next up on Fresh off the Boat--
###427 MALE SPEAKER: This fucking salsa is so spicy, yo.
###431 EDDIE HUANG: Dude, that chile sauce is en fuego.
###434 I'm not doing that.
###435 My ass would be on fire by like 7:00 PM.
###438 Oh my god.
###440
