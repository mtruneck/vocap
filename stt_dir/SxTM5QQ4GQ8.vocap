###34 HARVEY FOSTER: I liked pulling into that bowl and just being
###37 like, what there's a skatable bowl here?
###39 Where are we?
###41 Is there electricity here?
###42 
###57 -No, I've done it twice.
###58 -I just smoked weed.
###61 -I've dranken six beers.
###63 
###66 -It's only day one of the trip.
###68 If it was like day 9 and we were closer to San Diego.
###71 Will you get that Medevac thing out?
###73 [LAUGHTER]
###75 -Right?
###77 HARVEY FOSTER: I like all the contrasts, man.
###79 
###82 Mexico's really laid back.
###84 And beer's cheap, and the smokes are cheap.
###89 And there's no pretty girls anywhere, so I'm not getting
###92 trouble with my woman.
###96 That's good.
###99 -You just want an excuse to hack shit up with a big knife.
###102 Toss it in.
###103 
###109 HARVEY FOSTER: Mexico's fucking sweet.
###111 [LAUGHTER]
###112 
###117 HIME HERBERT: Found an old church, that was kind of cool,
###119 climbed around in it, and then came back
###123 later, and blew it up.
###125 [EXPLOSION]
###127 
###131 KYNAN TAIT: I don't know where we got them from, but someone
###136 had a big bag of apple bombs and little firecrackers,
###140 little bombs or whatever, and we just threw them in the
###143 little empty cement box out back.
###146 HIME HERBERT: Dude, I felt that shit.
###148 [LAUGHTER]
###150 
###156 [INAUDIBLE]
###158 
###164 -This is Harvey with both hands--
###167 -This is Harvey with ten fingers.
###169 HARVEY FOSTER: Don't say that.
###172 HIME HERBERT: Son of a bitch.
###174 [EXPLOSION]
###176 HARVEY FOSTER: Whoa, that was the best one.
###178 
###186 HIME HERBERT: No mas.
###187 
###221 -The dirt bike guy, I have no idea.
###223 That dude was a wingnut, guaranteed.
###225 
###230 Everything was pioneered by offroad racers and surfers
###232 down here, as far as good spots to go to.
###235 Everybody's running from something, whether it's
###237 running from a 40 hour a week job, or responsibilities, or
###241 just tired of the rat race.
###243 And I think they come down here and just get turned on by
###245 the freedom.
###246 And they want to come down and not pay a bunch of taxes, and
###250 live somewhere where they can sort of do what they
###252 want and check out.
###255 RICHARD STEVENS: I've been living in
###255 here, now, for 30 years.
###258 Back in 1980 I came down here with a lot of friends, come
###262 down here surfing all the time, and ended up with an
###264 opportunity to buy a piece of property down here.
###267 And I had a lot of friends in construction, so we nabbed a
###271 bunch of wood and stuff from the job sides and came down
###274 here, saved our money up, and I started
###276 building a little spot.
###277 And that's how, really, Quatro Casas as a
###280 service community started.
###281 Because I was the first person to come out here and make it a
###284 place to live, you know.
###285 
###289 If you ever come to Mexico, don't worry, there's
###291 no danger out here.
###292 We're far away from all the city and all the trouble.
###295 
###298 This place is famous for its wave because its real long.
###301 And we get that off South swell, so when the Antartic
###304 starts to go into its winter--
###306 drop it!
###307 
###309 These guys are burning themselves.
###311 -Straight up.
###311 You straight [INAUDIBLE].
###313 -They are fucked up.
###316 -Howdy.
###317 [LAUGHTER]
###319 
###328 -Nice.
###330 RICHARD STEVENS: Hey, fire it that way because, otherwise,
###333 if it hits those solar panels, it's going to be problems.
###336 [LAUGHTER]
###337 -That's a proper cannon.
###338 
###352 ARTO SAARI: Burning wood, chopping fucking shit with an
###355 axe, is, fucking pretty awesome.
###359 a fire, to me, is like watching TV.
###363 I love fire.
###364 I like burning things down.
###365 And I think it's just in my blood, mostly, I think.
###370 HARVEY FOSTER: Yeah, because he's, like, from Finland.
###372 And I was in Sweden before, and I know they're all, like,
###375 outdoorsy people.
###377 And then I heard he had the nickname of Norseman of the
###381 woods or something.
###382 
###385 KYNAN TAIT: Well, he was kind of like another guy that I'd
###388 seen in skate videos since I really young.
###390 You know, all these pretty epic skate videos for years,
###396 since I was a little kid.
###398 Well, he's a lot bigger in person, so he seems just like
###400 a woodsman to me because I haven't really even seen him
###404 skate that much since we've been on the trip.
###406 
###410 ARTO SAARI: What [INAUDIBLE]?
###411 KYNAN TAIT: Like, as much as I love skating, I don't want to
###413 hear about it 24/7.
###415 So I think I get along better with like minded people who
###419 like skating but don't want to talk about it, really.
###424 So it's been easy getting along with him.
###427 -That's what she said nine months later.
###430 
###433 HARVEY FOSTER: You should throw it on.
###434 You did it.
###436 -That was team effort.
###437 HARVEY FOSTER: Oh, OK, I just had the torch passed to me.
###441 
###444 ARTO SAARI: When we got to Quatro Casas, just that,
###446 whatever, San Diego to Quatro Casas, what
###449 was that, 150 miles?
###452 For those two days that we spent there, I couldn't even
###455 think about skating.
###456 My ass piece was so just, mm, tense.
###462 [INAUDIBLE]
###462 I was just like, can't get my legs moving.
###463 I haven't ridden a bike for a year before I
###465 came on this trip.
###467 
###483 RICHARD STEVENS: I know a whole group of skaters that
###485 come from San Diego.
###486 They all come down on their hogs, skateboards tied on the
###489 back, hell yeah.
###490 
###494 RICHARD STEVENS: Everybody has a lot of dogs out here.
###496 You've got to have them for protection.
###499 They don't live long.
###500 -No?
###500 RICHARD STEVENS: Not out here in the wild,
###502 no, shit kill them--
###503 other dogs, coyotes, raccons, bobcats, they just get-- yeah,
###509 they just disappear.
###510 I don't see them again.
###512 They all have disease names, even the cats.
###515 There's Measles, and her three kids, which is Valium,
###517 Vicodin, and Viagra, the three orange ones.
###521 And then there's Ebola and gods, what's the one that
###528 looks like her, I forget her name--
###531 pneumonia, that's it.
###532 Pneumonia, and then there's Raunches.
###535 Raunches means hives.
###537 I've run out of names.
###538 I've got to think of new names.
###539 And I don't like to give the same name to an animal, so--
###542 -Sexual diseases.
###544 RICHARD STEVENS: Giving me new names.
###546 You guys have a good night, and I'll
###548 see you in the morning.
###549 All right?
###551 All right, guys.
###552 
###554 -I think people get psyched any time they
###556 see a pack of bikers.
###558 In the middle of nowhere, on like the long stretches of
###560 highways or whatever.
###560 People there are just like--
###563 -Fuck yeah.
###563 People are like, they're going somewhere,
###565 they're doing things.
###568 -You can see people looking at us on the road.
###571 -Yeah, I think when there's multiple of you.
###575 MATT FRICK: I secretly--
###578 -You're curious.
###579 You're motorcycle curious.
###580 RICHARD STEVENS: I'm very motorcycle curious.
###582 -You just need to let yourself go.
###584 RICHARD STEVENS: I look at motorcycles at the same time I
###586 masturbate.
###588 This is a whole thing.
###590 -I'm not sure what that means.
###593 Let's go ahead and make sure you mark that section.
###595 -In private, in private.
###596 -There is a camera here.
###598 
###600 MATT FRICK: In private.
###602 I look at these motocrycles in private.
###604 And I'm like, god damn it, I know what.
###605 I know what I want.
###606 I know exactly what I want.
###608 And I've just got to pull the trigger, and
###610 I've got to do it.
###612 And I just--
###613 [LAUGHTER]
###613 -This is bromance.
###615 -This is the bromantic weekend getaways.
###616
