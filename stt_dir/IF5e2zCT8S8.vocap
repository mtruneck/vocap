###8 SHANE SMITH: To understand the Iranian cinema, you have to
###11 understand the recent history of Iran itself.
###14 In the 1960s, there was the Shah of Iran, or the king.
###16 And he was very pro-Western, so lots of pro-Western movies
###20 that were kind of sexy comedies with girls in bikinis
###22 and sport cars.
###23 Then came the Islamic Revolution in 1979, led by the
###27 Ayatollah Khomeini, the one everybody knows about.
###30 He came along.
###31 And then they burned cinemas as
###32 symbols of Western decadence.
###33 Cinema was actually outlawed for a while.
###36 Then they took over the American embassy.
###38 And there was a hostage crisis.
###40 So movies became filled with propaganda against the West.
###43 After that there was the Iran-Iraq War.
###45 The Americans backed the Iraqis to attack Iran, which
###48 became the eighth bloodiest war in history.
###50 So lots of war films, lots of anti-Iraqi films, and lots of
###53 anti-Western films were made.
###54 [EXPLOSIONS]
###58 SHANE SMITH: Then, as the war ended, there were all these
###60 film crews around.
###61 So they started making movies.
###62 And this begins a renaissance in Iranian cinema.
###65 And despite all the restrictions and censorship
###67 and propaganda, these amazingly creative films were
###70 sneaking out of Iran and getting critically acclaimed.
###72 And then in 1997, the world really sat up and took notice,
###76 when "Taste of Cherry" won the Palme d'Or in Cannes.
###78 And its director, Abbas Kiarostami, became a worldwide
###82 figure in film.
###83 Since then, you always see Iranian
###85 films at the film festivals.
###86 And their content has become much more critical, dealing
###88 with things that were taboo before, like women, fucked up
###91 war veterans, Afghan refugees, and the poor.
###95 The next stop on the film tour of Tehran was the
###97 Iranian Film Museum.
###98 They had the usual photos and awards and posters, and my
###101 favorite, wax figures.
###103 So this is Ezzatollah.
###105 He's their big star from before the revolution and
###110 after the revolution.
###111 There is the children's section.
###114 I don't know if you can get a good shot of this.
###116 Maybe it's not the way he used to be.
###118 But it's scary.
###119 Thank god I'm not on acid.
###121 These two guys are freaking me out.
###123 
###125 The one thing that we did learn at the museum was how
###128 the Ayatollah Khomeini saved Iranian cinema.
###131 In 1979, people were burning cinemas, and no one was making
###134 any movies.
###135 Then one day the Ayatollah was at home.
###137 He's watching TV.
###138 And out comes a movie called "The Cow," which is a
###140 pre-revolutionary movie.
###142 But it's not a sexy comedy.
###143 It's about real people with real problems.
###146 He watched it and he said, actually,
###148 I'm not against cinema.
###149 I'm against promiscuity.
###151 So that one line, just that one sentence, and bam.
###154 They stopped burning cinemas.
###156 They started making films again.
###157 And that one sentence saved Iranian cinema.
###160 
###164 So that actor in the wheelchair, on the film set,
###166 is Jamshid Mashayekhi.
###168 He was actually in "The Cow," the film that not only saved
###171 Iranian cinema, but is actually credited by being the
###173 first in the Iranian New Wave movement.
###175 
###179 Now what is Iranian new wave cinema?
###181 Well it's kind of a combination between French New
###183 Wave cinema, Italian neorealism, fiction,
###187 documentary filmmaking, all mixed up into one, with all
###190 the restrictions of Sharia law.
###191 So you can't have kissing.
###192 And you can't have hand holding.
###194 So the Spielberg and Lucas of Iranian new wave cinema are
###198 Mohsen Makhmalbaf and Abbas Kiarostami.
###201 Now the star of Kiarostami's film, "Taste of Cherry,"
###204 Homayoun Ershadi, was actually at the next
###206 film set we went to.
###207 And I was like, hey, I recognize you.
###209 Because he was in "The Kite Runner" as well.
###212 You've been acting in Iranian cinema for a long time.
###215 
###236 And you became, for us, in the West, famous because of "Kite
###240 Runner." How is that different, to be in a film
###243 like that versus more traditional Iranian cinema?
###247 
###258 Did "Kite Runner" get released in Iran?
###261 HOMAYOUN ERSHADI: No.
###262 It didn't.
###263 But I think everybody saw it through pirated DVD.
###268 SHANE SMITH: But you're very famous Iranian
###269 actor outside of Iran.
###271 HOMAYOUN ERSHADI: Actually, I think so.
###273 I am more famous over there than here.
###275 SHANE SMITH: That's perfect.
###276 HOMAYOUN ERSHADI: Thank you very much.
###278 SHANE SMITH: So we left the film set.
###279 And went to an acting school, which was actually really
###281 interesting.
###282 Because we hear that Iran is a relatively
###284 conservative country.
###285 And they have Sharia law.
###286 I expected it would be 90% of men.
###289 But actually when we got there, there was just as many
###290 women as there were man.
###294 We were so surprised at this, in fact, that we want to meet
###296 Fereshteh Taerpour, who was one of the first women
###299 producers in Iran.
###300 We wanted to ask her, what is it like to be a woman in the
###303 Iranian film industry.
###305 FERESHTEH TAERPOUR: Before
###305 revolution we had only actress.
###307 We didn't have any female director, female producer,
###311 female art designer.
###313 But after revolution, it completely changed.
###316 It found a cultural meaning, working in
###319 the field of cinema.
###321 And it was a good prestige for people to work in this field.
###325 But the other thing I want to tell you as a secret, that if
###328 you stay here longer, you will realize that women
###332 here are not weak.
###334 And even sometimes, I am more powerful than men.
###339 Because the government doesn't want to be in the position
###343 that everyone say, OK, you don't pay attention to women.
###345 In that case, they will at least pretend to respect me
###348 more than men.
###352 SHANE SMITH: After that, the next thing we wanted to do was
###354 go buy some Iranian movies.
###357 Here we have "The Mothman Prophecies," maybe the worst
###360 movie ever made.
###362 We have "Escape Velocity," never heard of it.
###364 We've got some good classics here, Laurel and Hardy.
###369 This is "Walking Tall 2." And next to that we have the
###372 Ayatollah, I guess, giving a speech.
###376 What's interesting is that even though they're only
###378 allowed three or four American films a year, and you don't
###381 see a lot of Western music on the shelves, all the kids we
###384 talked to knew every American blockbuster.
###387 There's so many bootlegs out there.
###389 And something like 44% of the households
###391 in Iran have satellite.
###392 Half of Tehran has family in London.
###394 The other half as family in LA.
###396 And they know everything about the latest
###398 music, the latest styles--
###399 they knew everything.
###401 So when we were in the shop, we noticed that, like 20 DVDs
###403 had this one woman on the cover--
###405 Mahnaz Afshar.
###406 And we said, wow.
###407 She must be really big star.
###408 She's in like every movie.
###409 And they said oh, do you want to meet her?
###412 So they called her up.
###413 And she was actually having a jewelry show that night.
###415 And so she invites us to come up and check out her jewelry.
###420 We're outside of Tehran somewhere in a very rich
###423 suburb with one of the biggest stars.
###425 She's like the Kate Winslet of Iran.
###427 And a bunch of her friends just arrived.
###430 And it's the upper crust, elite, sexy, hair dyed, boots
###438 out Tehran, which we haven't seen much of at all.
###442 We've seen boots in, full hijab.
###445 It's interesting to see.
###447 How is it to be a big celebrity in Iran?
###449 Can you go shopping?
###451 Can you go out on the street?
###454 MAHNAZ AFSHAR: Yes, because I like.
###456 And I have a problem.
###458 But I like it.
###459 SHANE SMITH: You like the problem?
###460 MAHNAZ AFSHAR: Yeah.
###461 SHANE SMITH: And what is the problem?
###463 Too many people come to you?
###464 MAHNAZ AFSHAR: Too many people.
###464 For sign, for picture.
###467 Photograph, yeah.
###468 SHANE SMITH: And here in Iran, is it the same as Europe or
###471 America that celebrities are always in the newspapers?
###475 They're looking at your life?
###477 MAHNAZ AFSHAR: No, not Iran.
###479 Because in Iran, privacy is very important.
###485 SHANE SMITH: So they don't go through
###487 her garbage, or anything?
###489 No.
###490 So you can be private only when you go outside.
###492 MAHNAZ AFSHAR: Yes.
###492 SHANE SMITH: OK, thank you very much.
###494 Merci.
###494 MAHNAZ AFSHAR: Thank you.
###495 Nice to meet you.
###495 SHANE SMITH: Oh, I don't know if I'm allowed to.
###496 MAHNAZ AFSHAR: No problem.
###499 SHANE SMITH: So after the jewelry show we had to hurry.
###502 Because we were late to crash dinner with the jury from the
###505 International Urban Film Festival.
###507 Tomorrow night's the last night, the grand gala.
###510 So tonight all the directors are here.
###512 All the writers are here.
###514 And the jury is here to talk about the films.
###516 
###520 Nice to meet you.
###520 Thank you for having us.
###521 It's very nice.
###522 
###547 They just told me that Guy Maddin is going to win for
###551 Best Documentary, even though it's not a documentary.
###554 And that because I'm Canadian, they want me to go accept the
###557 award at the film festival.
###562 Perfect.
