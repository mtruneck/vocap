4

Boo-yah!

32
0:1:4,33 --> 0:1:5,265
Let's go.


33
0:1:5,265 --> 0:1:6,399

<i> Over the course
 of his life,</i>


39
0:1:26,352 --> 0:1:28,988
<i> he's been an engineer,
 a real estate broker,</i>

0:1:28,988 --> 0:1:31,691
<i> and a military officer.</i>


41
0:1:31,691 --> 0:1:33,626
<i> Lately, he's been

43
0:1:36,696 --> 0:1:39,132
<i> One final project
 that he wants to leave</i>


44
0:1:39,132 --> 0:1:42,502
<i> behind for his children
 and grandchildren.</i>


45
0:1:42,502 --> 0:1:44,137
Brent: This is going to
be something that


46
0:1:44,137 --> 0:1:46,639
should last for
generation upon generation.


47
0:1:46,639 --> 0:1:49,8
And maybe someday a
hundred years from now


48
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:51,111
or a thousand
years from now,


49
0:1:51,111 --> 0:1:54,781
someone will come
up this road and say,


50
0:1:54,781 --> 0:1:56,216
"How did this
all happen?


51
0:1:56,216 --> 0:1:57,917
What was the
man thinking?"


52
0:1:57,917 --> 0:1:59,519
<i> Narrator: What
 Brent's thinking is:</i>


53
0:1:59,519 --> 0:2:1,387
<i> his family needs
 a last bastion of</i>


54
0:2:1,387 --> 0:2:7,227
<i> defense against
 a world gone mad.</i>


55
0:2:7,227 --> 0:2:12,999
<i> A stronghold to stand
 against the end of times.</i>


56
0:2:12,999 --> 0:2:17,27
<i> Forget bunkers, if
 the apocalypse comes,</i>


57
0:2:17,27 --> 0:2:24,944
<i> Brent's going
 medieval on it.</i>


58
0:2:24,944 --> 0:2:28,414
<i> Welcome to Brent's
 Doomsday Castle.</i>


59
0:2:28,414 --> 0:2:36,756
Brent: I'm preparing for
an electromagnetic pulse.


60
0:2:36,756 --> 0:2:38,892
This is the heart of
the castle, uh, over


61
0:2:38,892 --> 0:2:41,761
6,000 square
feet, two floors.


62
0:2:41,761 --> 0:2:43,53
Six bedrooms
will fill this,


63
0:2:43,53 --> 0:2:44,831
the upper two levels.


64
0:2:44,831 --> 0:2:46,633
This will be the main
hall where everybody


65
0:2:46,633 --> 0:2:47,934
will be gathering.


66
0:2:47,934 --> 0:2:49,502
We could put half
a cow out here.


67
0:2:49,502 --> 0:2:53,506
It'll be a feast just like
the old medieval times.


68
0:2:53,506 --> 0:2:55,141
This will be
the library.


69
0:2:55,141 --> 0:2:58,545
Solid mahogany
shelving, 10 feet high.


70
0:2:58,545 --> 0:3:1,247
A spiral staircase going
up almost three stories,


71
0:3:1,247 --> 0:3:2,715
up to the roof.


72
0:3:2,715 --> 0:3:5,652
In addition to everything
that you see on top,


73
0:3:5,652 --> 0:3:8,688
we've got almost 3,000
square feet of bunker


74
0:3:8,688 --> 0:3:10,323
that can handle anything.


75
0:3:10,323 --> 0:3:11,491
Sometimes people
will ask me,


76
0:3:11,491 --> 0:3:13,927
"How much money have
you put in to this?"


77
0:3:13,927 --> 0:3:15,228
I'm probably
approaching close


78
0:3:15,228 --> 0:3:17,3
to a million dollars.


79
0:3:17,3 --> 0:3:18,932
But I built a
castle because


80
0:3:18,932 --> 0:3:21,367
castles are all rock.


81
0:3:21,367 --> 0:3:22,735
It can't burn.


82
0:3:22,735 --> 0:3:24,771
It would probably
withstand most major


83
0:3:24,771 --> 0:3:27,774
earthquakes or any
other catastrophe.


84
0:3:27,774 --> 0:3:29,242
<i> Narrator: But the
 disaster scenario</i>


85
0:3:29,242 --> 0:3:31,744
<i> Brent fears
 most is an EMP,</i>


86
0:3:31,744 --> 0:3:33,746
<i> an electromagnetic pulse,</i>


87
0:3:33,746 --> 0:3:38,484
<i> a burst of energy that can
 fry electrical circuits.</i>


88
0:3:38,484 --> 0:3:40,987
<i> And that can be set
 off by the explosion of</i>


89
0:3:40,987 --> 0:3:44,624
<i> atomic bombs
 in the atmosphere.</i>


90
0:3:44,624 --> 0:3:47,493
Brent: We have so many
enemies out there,


91
0:3:47,493 --> 0:3:50,863
both religious and
non-religious that


92
0:3:50,863 --> 0:3:54,2
are out to do America
in, in some way.


93
0:3:54,2 --> 0:3:57,36
Many countries have
the ability to get


94
0:3:57,36 --> 0:4:0,24
a small atomic bomb
25 to 200 miles


95
0:4:0,24 --> 0:4:2,208
up into the atmosphere.


96
0:4:2,208 --> 0:4:3,977
<i> Narrator: A nuclear
 blast large enough and</i>


97
0:4:3,977 --> 0:4:6,746
<i> high enough over
 Kansas would cause an EMP</i>


98
0:4:6,746 --> 0:4:9,782
<i> that could affect the
 entire Continental U.S.</i>


99
0:4:9,782 --> 0:4:11,884
<i> Brent fears such
 a blast could black out</i>


100
0:4:11,884 --> 0:4:15,922
<i> the entire U.S.,
 perhaps forever.</i>


101
0:4:15,922 --> 0:4:17,624
Brent: It's gonna take
anything that has a


102
0:4:17,624 --> 0:4:19,459
computer chip, which
almost everything


103
0:4:19,459 --> 0:4:20,727
is run by that.


104
0:4:20,727 --> 0:4:23,96
There would be no way to
communicate with people.


105
0:4:23,96 --> 0:4:24,13
There is no water;


106
0:4:24,13 --> 0:4:25,632
there's no sanitation.


107
0:4:25,632 --> 0:4:28,935
It will be only a matter
of days until people


108
0:4:28,935 --> 0:4:31,971
realize that they
can't get any food.


109
0:4:31,971 --> 0:4:36,743
Then everyone will turn
into basically a savage.


110
0:4:36,743 --> 0:4:39,78
We would go back to
the medieval days.


111
0:4:39,78 --> 0:4:42,282
My fear was: with the
large family that I have,


112
0:4:42,282 --> 0:4:44,384
how would I protect them?


113
0:4:44,384 --> 0:4:47,2
I've got 10 children.


114
0:4:47,2 --> 0:4:51,724
My youngest is 8 years
old and my oldest is,


115
0:4:51,724 --> 0:4:56,462
be 41 this year,
so quite a range.


116
0:4:56,462 --> 0:4:58,564
<i> Narrator: Today, Brent's
 assembling his clan to</i>


117
0:4:58,564 --> 0:5:1,1
<i> practice bugging
 out to the castle.</i>


118
0:5:1,1 --> 0:5:2,502
Brent: We're gonna be
doing all types of


119
0:5:2,502 --> 0:5:3,77
training, things
you've never seen


120
0:5:3,77 --> 0:5:4,837
or done before.


121
0:5:4,837 --> 0:5:6,205
<i> Narrator: But once
 they get up there,</i>


122
0:5:6,205 --> 0:5:9,108
<i> he'll have a surprise
 in store for them.</i>


123
0:5:9,108 --> 0:5:12,11
<i> He wants his family's help
 finishing the castle,</i>


124
0:5:12,11 --> 0:5:13,813
<i> but fears few of
 his ten children are</i>


125
0:5:13,813 --> 0:5:16,549
<i> truly up to
 the challenge.</i>


126
0:5:16,549 --> 0:5:17,85
Ashley: How are
we going to bathe?


127
0:5:17,85 --> 0:5:19,552
How are we going
to survive?


128
0:5:19,552 --> 0:5:22,689
When I told the kids
what I was going to do,


129
0:5:22,689 --> 0:5:24,23
they kind of
laughed and said,


130
0:5:24,23 --> 0:5:24,957
"What?


131
0:5:24,957 --> 0:5:25,925
A castle?


132
0:5:25,925 --> 0:5:27,93
Why are you
building something


133
0:5:27,93 --> 0:5:28,628
like that out there?"


134
0:5:28,628 --> 0:5:31,497
My oldest one is
Brent the Second.


135
0:5:31,497 --> 0:5:33,399
I don't know what
his strength is.


136
0:5:33,399 --> 0:5:34,967
He should be one of the
most knowledgeable,


137
0:5:34,967 --> 0:5:37,17
but that's not the way it
is right at this moment.


138
0:5:37,17 --> 0:5:38,404
Brent Jr.: You're
gonna show me how


139
0:5:38,404 --> 0:5:39,472
to use this thing?


140
0:5:39,472 --> 0:5:40,473
Brent: I'm sure we'll
get through all that.


141
0:5:40,473 --> 0:5:41,607
Brent Jr.: Alright.


142
0:5:41,607 --> 0:5:43,176
Brent: If anyone thinks
that I'm paranoid,


143
0:5:43,176 --> 0:5:45,712
it's probably Ashley
that would be the oldest


144
0:5:45,712 --> 0:5:47,914
child from my
second marriage.


145
0:5:47,914 --> 0:5:50,249
Ashley is the model
of the family.


146
0:5:50,249 --> 0:5:53,353
She is more of a primper
than a prepper though.


147
0:5:53,353 --> 0:5:54,954
Ashley: My plan
is basically,


148
0:5:54,954 --> 0:5:58,991
to grab my makeup, grab
my little Tebow dog


149
0:5:58,991 --> 0:6:0,93
and just head out.


150
0:6:0,93 --> 0:6:2,128
Brent: We had two
twins, a boy-girl twin


151
0:6:2,128 --> 0:6:3,83
that are 19 years of age.


152
0:6:3,83 --> 0:6:7,734
And the twins' names are
Michael and Dawn-Marie.


153
0:6:7,734 --> 0:6:9,35
Dawn-Marie: I'm not
sure if the end of the


154
0:6:9,35 --> 0:6:11,3
world is going to
happen but if it does,


155
0:6:11,3 --> 0:6:13,206
it's always better
to be prepared than


156
0:6:13,206 --> 0:6:14,507
not be prepared.


157
0:6:14,507 --> 0:6:15,541
Michael: The castle.


158
0:6:15,541 --> 0:6:16,909
It's not finished yet,
but I know that when


159
0:6:16,909 --> 0:6:18,44
it is going
to be finished,


160
0:6:18,44 --> 0:6:20,88
it's going to be
amazing up there.


161
0:6:20,88 --> 0:6:22,81
Brent: Let's,
go everybody.


162
0:6:22,81 --> 0:6:23,549
It's a long
walk up there.


163
0:6:23,549 --> 0:6:25,51
Okay, so everything
we can carry,


164
0:6:25,51 --> 0:6:27,487
we want to carry it now.


165
0:6:27,487 --> 0:6:29,689
Son: C'mon guys, keep up.


166
0:6:29,689 --> 0:6:31,29
A little bit further.


167
0:6:31,29 --> 0:6:32,592
Daughter: We
getting close?


168
0:6:32,592 --> 0:6:33,993
Brent: They thought
it was real simple.


169
0:6:33,993 --> 0:6:36,529
You grab some things and
you run for the hills,


170
0:6:36,529 --> 0:6:38,131
well, it doesn't
work that way.


171
0:6:38,131 --> 0:6:39,365
Michael: Alright,
we gotta check


172
0:6:39,365 --> 0:6:41,134
the perimeter.


173
0:6:41,134 --> 0:6:42,802
Girls, get the rear.


174
0:6:42,802 --> 0:6:45,938
Brent: Alright, let's go.


175
0:6:45,938 --> 0:6:47,64
Let's get
everything inside.


176
0:6:47,64 --> 0:6:49,242
<i> Narrator: Now that
 they've arrived,</i>


177
0:6:49,242 --> 0:6:52,44
<i> Brent's kids are about
 to learn the true reason</i>


178
0:6:52,44 --> 0:6:53,846
<i> they've been assembled.</i>


179
0:6:53,846 --> 0:6:54,647
Dawn-Marie: Alright.


180
0:6:54,647 --> 0:6:56,549
Let's set up
all the chairs.


181
0:6:56,549 --> 0:6:59,485
Brent: I decided I was not
going to leave my kids


182
0:6:59,485 --> 0:7:1,587
with a fortune of money.


183
0:7:1,587 --> 0:7:3,689
One of the main reasons
for having you all come up


184
0:7:3,689 --> 0:7:5,591
is 'cause I wanted to
tell y'all something.


185
0:7:5,591 --> 0:7:8,795
I wanted to reveal it in
the midst of as many, uh,


186
0:7:8,795 --> 0:7:12,765
of my family members,
uh, as I possibly could.


187
0:7:12,765 --> 0:7:15,768
I'm taking whatever
money I have at,


188
0:7:15,768 --> 0:7:17,87
at my death other than
some small amounts,


189
0:7:17,87 --> 0:7:20,807
and, and putting it
into this castle.


190
0:7:20,807 --> 0:7:22,942
It has been put
into what I call


191
0:7:22,942 --> 0:7:24,977
the last retreat
family trust.


192
0:7:24,977 --> 0:7:26,913
It's designed to
last 100 years,


193
0:7:26,913 --> 0:7:29,182
and it can't be broken.


194
0:7:29,182 --> 0:7:31,851
There is no one that can
deed it or take it over.


195
0:7:31,851 --> 0:7:33,152

 looking for</i>


196
0:7:33,152 --> 0:7:34,62
<i> an heir to his throne,</i>


197
0:7:34,62 --> 0:7:36,355
<i> someone he can
 trust to assume the</i>

 the crown.</i>


201
0:7:43,429 --> 0:7:44,53
Brent Jr.: I'm the
obvious choice.


202
0:7:44,53 --> 0:7:46,799
I'm Brent the Second
and I'm the oldest.


203
0:7:46,799 --> 0:7:47,767
He's the king.


204
0:7:47,767 --> 0:7:51,37
I am the prince.


205
0:7:51,37 --> 0:7:52,839
<i> Narrator: But Brent's
 decided that only</i>


206
0:7:52,839 --> 0:7:54,841
<i> two of his 10 children,</i>


207
0:7:54,841 --> 0:7:56,509
<i> one from each
 of his marriages,</i>


208
0:7:56,509 --> 0:7:58,377
<i> will be executors
 of the trust.</i>


209
0:7:58,377 --> 0:8:0,947
Brent: There will be two
people that will help be


210
0:8:0,947 --> 0:8:4,16
the executors to make
sure everything happens.


211
0:8:4,16 --> 0:8:6,986
Now, I have some ideas of
who I'd like it to be,


212
0:8:6,986 --> 0:8:10,189
but how dedicated
are you into seeing


213
0:8:10,189 --> 0:8:12,158
my dream come true?


214
0:8:12,158 --> 0:8:15,495
I mean can you make
my dream your dream?


215
0:8:15,495 --> 0:8:17,163
There are some
certain qualities that


216
0:8:17,163 --> 0:8:20,166
I'm looking for in
those two children.


217
0:8:20,166 --> 0:8:22,568
One: they have to
really want it and


218
0:8:22,568 --> 0:8:23,803
they believe in it.


219
0:8:23,803 --> 0:8:25,638
Second thing, they
have to be is they


220
0:8:25,638 --> 0:8:27,6
have to be
knowledgeable.


221
0:8:27,6 --> 0:8:28,641
They either have to
know construction,


222
0:8:28,641 --> 0:8:30,243
they have to
know business,


223
0:8:30,243 --> 0:8:31,777
they have to
know something.


224
0:8:31,777 --> 0:8:33,145
I want to know
that they'll


225
0:8:33,145 --> 0:8:34,38
carry out my wishes.


226
0:8:34,38 --> 0:8:35,548
Dawn-Marie: I just
want you to know that


227
0:8:35,548 --> 0:8:36,682
I'm very proud you and.


228
0:8:36,682 --> 0:8:37,85
Brent: Thank you, honey.


229
0:8:37,85 --> 0:8:38,918
Dawn-Marie: And I,
you're definitely a


230
0:8:38,918 --> 0:8:40,253
role model to this
family and some.


231
0:8:40,253 --> 0:8:41,354
Brent: Well, thank you.


232
0:8:41,354 --> 0:8:42,421
Dawn-Marie: Someone
that we can look up to.


233
0:8:42,421 --> 0:8:44,56
I think it would be a
possibility that my dad


234
0:8:44,56 --> 0:8:46,792
would maybe pick me,
because I've definitely


235
0:8:46,792 --> 0:8:49,362
come up here a lot of
times and helped my dad.


236
0:8:49,362 --> 0:8:51,197
All the sheetrock,
downstairs,


237
0:8:51,197 --> 0:8:53,32
me and my dad
did all of that.


238
0:8:53,32 --> 0:8:54,8
Ashley: Amazing, that's
awesome and this is the


239
0:8:54,8 --> 0:8:56,569
best gift, better than
any Christmas present,


240
0:8:56,569 --> 0:8:59,438
better than anything
that I could get,


241
0:8:59,438 --> 0:9:0,54
this right here.


242
0:9:0,54 --> 0:9:2,341
I'm shocked, I
didn't expect this.


243
0:9:2,341 --> 0:9:3,609
I think he's
gonna choose me.


244
0:9:3,609 --> 0:9:4,777
Um.


245
0:9:4,777 --> 0:9:7,547
I say that because
I know more.


246
0:9:7,547 --> 0:9:11,484
I have proven
myself more I think.


247
0:9:11,484 --> 0:9:14,32
Brent Jr.: I wanna take on
your dream, like you said,


248
0:9:14,32 --> 0:9:16,889
and help you get this,
get the roof on this place


249
0:9:16,889 --> 0:9:18,291
and get this
place completed.


250
0:9:18,291 --> 0:9:20,326
So I'll be working
twice as hard.


251
0:9:20,326 --> 0:9:21,827
Michael: I think what's
important is if you


252
0:9:21,827 --> 0:9:23,396
actually care about
this mountain house,


253
0:9:23,396 --> 0:9:25,798
then you should
just prove it.


254
0:9:25,798 --> 0:9:26,799
Dawn-Marie: Yep.


255
0:9:26,799 --> 0:9:27,9
I agree.


256
0:9:27,9 --> 0:9:29,68
Michael: He needs you
to do something, do it.


257
0:9:29,68 --> 0:9:30,603
Use your actions
and not your words.


258
0:9:30,603 --> 0:9:32,104
Brent: Dawn-Marie's
spent the most,


259
0:9:32,104 --> 0:9:33,105
most time with me.


260
0:9:33,105 --> 0:9:34,73
Michael would be second.


261
0:9:34,73 --> 0:9:35,341
Brent has never
been up here really,


262
0:9:35,341 --> 0:9:36,642
he's really not
contributed.


263
0:9:36,642 --> 0:9:38,744
And Ashley really hasn't,
she's been up here as a


264
0:9:38,744 --> 0:9:42,415
little child, but not what
I would call contributing.


265
0:9:42,415 --> 0:9:44,283
<i> Narrator: Brent wants

266
0:9:44,283 --> 0:9:47,53

271
0:10:4,57 --> 0:10:6,38
<i> and a small fortune,</i>


272
0:10:6,38 --> 0:10:8,441
<i> building a literal
 castle to serve as</i>


273
0:10:8,441 --> 0:10:10,776
<i> his family's fortress
 in the Carolina's</i>


274
0:10:10,776 --> 0:10:12,878
<i> during the end times.</i>


275
0:10:12,878 --> 0:10:14,347
Brent: My particular
piece of property is


276
0:10:14,347 --> 0:10:17,984
50 acres surrounded
by 1,000 acres.


277
0:10:17,984 --> 0:10:19,752
There is
only one way in.


278
0:10:19,752 --> 0:10:21,921
It is literally
almost cliffs on


279
0:10:21,921 --> 0:10:23,589
each side to get up.


280
0:10:23,589 --> 0:10:27,393
The property has a
400-foot well with a


281
0:10:27,393 --> 0:10:29,28
stream running
right past it.


282
0:10:29,28 --> 0:10:32,898
I bought 40,000
heirloom seeds so we


283
0:10:32,898 --> 0:10:35,201
can grow any kind
of a vegetable.


284
0:10:35,201 --> 0:10:36,769
<i> Narrator: To determine

288
0:10:44,176 --> 0:10:45,711
Brent: I'm going to be
looking at these kids,


289
0:10:45,711 --> 0:10:48,114
each one of them today to
see how they interact,


290
0:10:48,114 --> 0:10:51,984
how tempers flare,
how, who helps who.


291
0:10:51,984 --> 0:10:53,919
<i> Narrator: Brent fears
 America's enemies could</i>


292
0:10:53,919 --> 0:10:56,656

 device in the atmosphere</i>

0:10:59,925 --> 0:11:2,294

<i> power supply
 for the castle.</i>


298
0:11:9,368 --> 0:11:10,569
Brent: We need
batteries.


299
0:11:10,569 --> 0:11:12,104
We need windmills.


300
0:11:12,104 --> 0:11:13,673
We need solar panels.


301
0:11:13,673 --> 0:11:16,609
We need to be able to
run on 12 volt, 24 volt,


302
0:11:16,609 --> 0:11:20,579
48 volt or the
standard 120-volt.


303
0:11:20,579 --> 0:11:22,148
Dawn-Marie: Dad, what
exactly are we doing?


304
0:11:22,148 --> 0:11:23,382
What are we making?


305
0:11:23,382 --> 0:11:26,285
Brent: It's called
a solar panel array.


306
0:11:26,285 --> 0:11:28,788
We're gonna have
eight solar panels,


307
0:11:28,788 --> 0:11:31,991
mounted to this
bracket that can tilt


308
0:11:31,991 --> 0:11:35,528
however we want it
so it's facing the sun.


309
0:11:35,528 --> 0:11:37,73
<i> Narrator: Brent plans to
 use solar panels to charge</i>


310
0:11:37,73 --> 0:11:39,699

Ashley: Where are
the instructions?


315
0:11:48,474 --> 0:11:49,542
Michael: We don't
need instructions.


316
0:11:49,542 --> 0:11:52,978
Brent: We put it together
12 years ago, now we.


317
0:11:52,978 --> 0:11:56,15
Ashley: Women read
instructions, men don't.


318
0:11:56,15 --> 0:11:58,651
Brent: We're gonna be
facing south because the


319
0:11:58,651 --> 0:12:2,21
sun comes from east to
west and that's a southern


320
0:12:2,21 --> 0:12:4,9
direction right there,
so we want the most sun


321
0:12:4,9 --> 0:12:6,759
during the day to
these solar panels.


322
0:12:6,759 --> 0:12:8,427
Dawn-Marie: How do you
know that's south?


323
0:12:8,427 --> 0:12:9,795
Brent: I have a compass.


324
0:12:9,795 --> 0:12:12,498
Dawn-Marie is the wild
child of the family.


325
0:12:12,498 --> 0:12:14,934
A true "A" personality.


326
0:12:14,934 --> 0:12:16,802
But when it comes to
counting on somebody I


327
0:12:16,802 --> 0:12:19,371
know that we can
always count on her.


328
0:12:19,371 --> 0:12:20,406
Oh!


329
0:12:20,406 --> 0:12:21,44
Michael!


330
0:12:21,44 --> 0:12:22,541
Michael: Come on,
it's right there.


331
0:12:22,541 --> 0:12:23,609
It's fine.


332
0:12:23,609 --> 0:12:25,111
Brent: Michael, I know
he's gonna be a great


333
0:12:25,111 --> 0:12:26,412
asset to the family.


334
0:12:26,412 --> 0:12:29,281
I would say his weakness
is Michael still has


335
0:12:29,281 --> 0:12:32,184
not yet learned
responsibility.

341

Brent: I need to look more
in depth at each child as


342
0:12:46,165 --> 0:12:48,33
far as seeing who
I think should be a


343
0:12:48,33 --> 0:12:49,268
leader in the trust.


344
0:12:49,268 --> 0:12:51,17
It's gonna take
some more time.


345
0:12:51,17 --> 0:12:53,105
We're gonna have
to go through maybe


346
0:12:53,105 --> 0:12:54,273
a few more tests.


347
0:12:54,273 --> 0:12:55,674
Okay, we're done.


348
0:12:55,674 --> 0:13:0,146
Let's go see what
the next project is.

<i> prepping

354

Brent Jr.: What
can I learn today?


355
0:13:12,925 --> 0:13:14,727
Brent: Some of my
children that don't live


356
0:13:14,727 --> 0:13:18,13
right next to me
really have no idea


357
0:13:18,13 --> 0:13:19,532
how to handle a weapon.


358
0:13:19,532 --> 0:13:21,7
Brent the Second, which
is my oldest child,


359
0:13:21,7 --> 0:13:24,69
worries me the most 'cause
I've never seen him,


360
0:13:24,69 --> 0:13:26,105
to my knowledge he's
never had any training.


361
0:13:26,105 --> 0:13:29,74
I asked him to choose a
weapon and he picks up


362
0:13:29,74 --> 0:13:31,31
an AK47 and the first
thing I said is,


363
0:13:31,31 --> 0:13:32,344
"Do you know how
to use that?"


364
0:13:32,344 --> 0:13:33,646
This has to be down.


365
0:13:33,646 --> 0:13:34,68
Brent Jr.: Okay.


366
0:13:34,68 --> 0:13:35,781
Brent: 'Cause that
is your safety on


367
0:13:35,781 --> 0:13:36,882
this particular gun.


368
0:13:36,882 --> 0:13:38,551
Now we're loaded.


369
0:13:38,551 --> 0:13:39,618
Brent Jr.: Okay.


370
0:13:39,618 --> 0:13:40,653
So it's live?


371
0:13:40,653 --> 0:13:41,654
Brent: It's live.


372
0:13:41,654 --> 0:13:42,822
Please do not point
it in my direction.


373
0:13:42,822 --> 0:13:43,956
Brent Jr.: Okay.


374
0:13:43,956 --> 0:13:45,724
Brent: We chose
guns that were like


375
0:13:45,724 --> 0:13:46,926
police-type weapons.


376
0:13:46,926 --> 0:13:48,427
Or army-type weapons.


377
0:13:48,427 --> 0:13:51,463
An AR15 or an AK47.


378
0:13:51,463 --> 0:13:53,666
It needed to be something
that was pretty standard


379
0:13:53,666 --> 0:13:55,234
and there were a lot of.


380
0:13:55,234 --> 0:13:56,435
You're ready to shoot.


381
0:13:56,435 --> 0:13:57,469
Brent Jr.: Alright I am.


382
0:13:57,469 --> 0:13:59,205
Just aim and shoot?


383
0:13:59,205 --> 0:14:0,472
Brent: Hold up a minute.


384
0:14:0,472 --> 0:14:2,208
Uh, you wanna put some
earplugs in here.


385
0:14:2,208 --> 0:14:3,342
Brent Jr.: Do you really?


386
0:14:3,342 --> 0:14:4,543
I don't need earplugs.


387
0:14:4,543 --> 0:14:5,377
Brent: Alright.


388
0:14:5,377 --> 0:14:6,312
Brent Jr.: You ready?


389
0:14:6,312 --> 0:14:7,246
Brent: Well since
it's your first time,


390
0:14:7,246 --> 0:14:8,414
let's go for the
biggest target which


391
0:14:8,414 --> 0:14:12,985
will be that
can up top.


392
0:14:12,985 --> 0:14:13,986
Brent Jr.: Did I hit it?


393
0:14:13,986 --> 0:14:16,455
Brent: I have not the
foggiest idea the


394
0:14:16,455 --> 0:14:17,756
way you were firing.


395
0:14:17,756 --> 0:14:19,24
Brent Jr.: My ears
are ringing now.


396
0:14:19,24 --> 0:14:20,226
Brent: Do you know
what happens when you


397
0:14:20,226 --> 0:14:21,493
fire that many times?


398
0:14:21,493 --> 0:14:22,461
Brent Jr.: What's that?


399
0:14:22,461 --> 0:14:23,596
Brent: Because the
gun is pulling back.


400
0:14:23,596 --> 0:14:24,964
Brent Jr.: I need
you to speak louder.


401
0:14:24,964 --> 0:14:26,332
Brent: You're
going up higher and


402
0:14:26,332 --> 0:14:27,633
higher and higher.


403
0:14:27,633 --> 0:14:29,168
I'd be more fearful
of him shooting one of us


404
0:14:29,168 --> 0:14:31,237
than shooting somebody
else that might be out


405
0:14:31,237 --> 0:14:32,972
there so we're definitely
gonna have to spend


406
0:14:32,972 --> 0:14:34,306
some time with him.


407
0:14:34,306 --> 0:14:36,75
Okay, put it in
your shoulder.


408
0:14:36,75 --> 0:14:38,143
Dawn-Marie is
coming along.


409
0:14:38,143 --> 0:14:40,279
After she shot the gun a
couple time she settled


410
0:14:40,279 --> 0:14:42,882
down and she really
got serious about it.


411
0:14:42,882 --> 0:14:44,383
Ashley had never
shot a shotgun.


412
0:14:44,383 --> 0:14:45,417
She was a little scared,


413
0:14:45,417 --> 0:14:47,887
she didn't know how
noisy it was gonna be.


414
0:14:47,887 --> 0:14:49,855
Ashley: I'm so scared.


415
0:14:49,855 --> 0:14:52,491
(Screams).


416
0:14:52,491 --> 0:14:53,592
I don't like that.


417
0:14:53,592 --> 0:14:55,861
I don't like that.


418
0:14:55,861 --> 0:14:57,73
Brent: Probably
the best shooter was


419
0:14:57,73 --> 0:15:0,766
probably Michael
out there.


420
0:15:0,766 --> 0:15:3,102

Brent Jr.: Alright.


429
0:15:23,55 --> 0:15:24,23
Are we ready?


430
0:15:24,23 --> 0:15:24,89
Let's go.


431
0:15:24,89 --> 0:15:25,791
It's a rainy day;


432
0:15:25,791 --> 0:15:26,959
you know there's
people out there


433
0:15:26,959 --> 0:15:28,527
getting ready
to attack.


434
0:15:28,527 --> 0:15:31,13
Brent: After one person
shoots, you move back.


435
0:15:31,13 --> 0:15:32,131
Son: Let's go.


436
0:15:32,131 --> 0:15:33,799
Brent: And another
person moves in.


437
0:15:33,799 --> 0:15:35,401
When the girls are out,
the archers come in,


438
0:15:35,401 --> 0:15:38,57
two at a time.


439
0:15:38,57 --> 0:15:39,738
Amanda: Pull back.


440
0:15:39,738 --> 0:15:42,574
Now push it back in.


441
0:15:42,574 --> 0:15:44,41
Pull down, but
not all the way.


442
0:15:44,41 --> 0:15:45,544
Ashley: But
not yet though.


443
0:15:45,544 --> 0:15:46,378
Amanda: Yeah.


444
0:15:46,378 --> 0:15:48,13
Brent: Alright,
two more people.


445
0:15:48,13 --> 0:15:48,914
Son: Alright.


446
0:15:48,914 --> 0:15:50,115
Brent: Good, very good.


447
0:15:50,115 --> 0:15:52,151
The reason for the
shooting drill tonight was


448
0:15:52,151 --> 0:15:54,486
to see how everyone
would react under a


449
0:15:54,486 --> 0:15:56,588
simulated firing condition.


450
0:15:56,588 --> 0:15:58,457
Could everybody
work in unison?


451
0:15:58,457 --> 0:15:59,959
There was some
complaining.


452
0:15:59,959 --> 0:16:1,393
Brent Jr.: I feel like I
just jumped in a lake.


453
0:16:1,393 --> 0:16:2,795
Brent: Everybody
was tired;


454
0:16:2,795 --> 0:16:3,829
everybody was hungry.


455
0:16:3,829 --> 0:16:5,664
That is the worst
situation you could


456
0:16:5,664 --> 0:16:7,866
ever have in any
kind of a firefight.


457
0:16:7,866 --> 0:16:10,169
You two are taking shots,
you're taking a shot.


458
0:16:10,169 --> 0:16:11,57
I was real proud
of all of them.


459
0:16:11,57 --> 0:16:12,905
They did a good job.


460
0:16:12,905 --> 0:16:15,541
<i> Narrator: Exhausted and

462
0:16:17,743 --> 0:16:19,345

0:16:25,884 --> 0:16:26,919
People are hungry!


468
0:16:26,919 --> 0:16:28,87
We did something
that none of the


469
0:16:28,87 --> 0:16:29,221
kids have ever
done on this trip.


470
0:16:29,221 --> 0:16:31,56
We gave each
of them an MRE.


471

Ashley: Are those
still safe to eat?


478
0:16:47,873 --> 0:16:49,508
Brent: Well, I've had
one every year to


479
0:16:49,508 --> 0:16:52,745
test it myself, ate it,
never got sick, so.


480
0:16:52,745 --> 0:16:56,482
We tried to make this
training exercise


481
0:16:56,482 --> 0:16:58,83
as real life as possible.


482
0:16:58,83 --> 0:17:0,486
I chose probably the
worst thing to eat out of


483
0:17:0,486 --> 0:17:2,554
everything that we could
have possibly have made.


484
0:17:2,554 --> 0:17:4,356
I had to make sure
they could at least


485
0:17:4,356 --> 0:17:5,891
stomach the MRE's.


486
0:17:5,891 --> 0:17:7,126
Brent Jr.: Alright,
who wants to take a


487
0:17:7,126 --> 0:17:9,328
bite of this
12-year-old beef patty?


488
0:17:9,328 --> 0:17:12,698
Brent: They weren't too
happy about those things.


489
0:17:12,698 --> 0:17:14,533
Girlfriend: It
smells terrible.


490
0:17:14,533 --> 0:17:16,735
Brent: Nobody got sick,
that was a good thing.


491
0:17:16,735 --> 0:17:20,72
Actually Michael thought
it was tremendous.


492
0:17:20,72 --> 0:17:22,808
He was sharing it with
everybody ah, there.


493
0:17:22,808 --> 0:17:24,476
Dawn-Marie: Does it
taste like ravioli?


494
0:17:24,476 --> 0:17:25,411
Michael: Yeah.


495
0:17:25,411 --> 0:17:26,345
Tastes good.


496
0:17:26,345 --> 0:17:27,713
Brother: It's
not that bad.


497
0:17:27,713 --> 0:17:29,415
Michael: It's
not bad at all.


498
0:17:29,415 --> 0:17:30,849
Brent: Taste it.


499
0:17:30,849 --> 0:17:31,717
Come on.


500
0:17:31,717 --> 0:17:34,486

were the one that.

she put the MRE in her

on it a little bit.


504

have to remember,

when it comes down to a
true survival situation,


508
0:17:49,301 --> 0:17:51,503
she's gonna have to
take what she can get,


509
0:17:51,503 --> 0:17:53,939
and be satisfied with it.

trap right now and

to do because it was so

the way it's gonna be.

0:20:18,784 --> 0:20:20,352
Nothing was
making any sense.


566
0:20:20,352 --> 0:20:22,2
We, we're just
running around with


567
0:20:22,2 --> 0:20:23,422
lights exploding.


568
0:20:23,422 --> 0:20:24,656
Ashley: Guys, is
this supposed to be


569
0:20:24,656 --> 0:20:25,924
happening right now?


570
0:20:25,924 --> 0:20:27,593
Brent: Now I know
exactly what it is.


571
0:20:27,593 --> 0:20:29,795
Coming out of the top
of the building we


572
0:20:29,795 --> 0:20:31,296
got all that rebar,
and it's acting


573
0:20:31,296 --> 0:20:32,531
like lightning rods.


574
0:20:32,531 --> 0:20:33,765
Shane: Right,
that's exposed.


575
0:20:33,765 --> 0:20:34,933
Brent: It's all
exposed and it's going


576
0:20:34,933 --> 0:20:36,68
right down through
the concrete.


577
0:20:36,68 --> 0:20:37,35
Brent Jr.: It's
not grounded?


578
0:20:37,35 --> 0:20:38,36
Brent: No, it's grounded.


579
0:20:38,36 --> 0:20:39,204
It's going right into
the concrete here.


580
0:20:39,204 --> 0:20:40,872
Looking back I think
we figured out


581
0:20:40,872 --> 0:20:42,74
what the problem was.


582
0:20:42,74 --> 0:20:45,77
We filled the
block with steel.


583
0:20:45,77 --> 0:20:48,46
And so I realize now
that we do have to put a


584
0:20:48,46 --> 0:20:50,816
lightning rod and tie it
to all of our electrical


585
0:20:50,816 --> 0:20:53,418
and that should take
care of the problem.

my children
this weekend.


595
0:21:9,601 --> 0:21:12,904
Michael, he still
shows good leadership,


596
0:21:12,904 --> 0:21:15,7
but he's very
impulsive, and


597
0:21:15,7 --> 0:21:16,541
that has to be
tamed down.


598
0:21:16,541 --> 0:21:19,444
Brent came here knowing
nothing about a gun.


599
0:21:19,444 --> 0:21:21,113
He did pretty
well with it.


600
0:21:21,113 --> 0:21:24,95
Ashley came and I saw some
strength come out of her.


601
0:21:24,95 --> 0:21:26,385
Dawn-Marie was
Dawn-Marie.


602
0:21:26,385 --> 0:21:28,787
She just chipped in
and wanted to be


603
0:21:28,787 --> 0:21:30,289
a part of everything.


604
0:21:30,289 --> 0:21:32,758
I think we still need
a lot of training.


605
0:21:32,758 --> 0:21:35,27
I need to look more in
depth at each child


606
0:21:35,27 --> 0:21:37,29
as far as seeing who
I think should be a


607
0:21:37,29 --> 0:21:38,33
leader in the trust.


608
0:21:38,33 --> 0:21:40,732
I don't think any full
decision has been made.


609

I'm not 100% sure.

658
0:23:33,378 --> 0:23:35,814

support all the decks
around the castle to full


660
0:23:38,717 --> 0:23:41,186

pour a concrete roof


661
0:23:41,186 --> 0:23:42,821
and a concrete deck.


662
0:23:42,821 --> 0:23:45,791

And, you know,
maybe it is paranoia.


706

0:27:26,745 --> 0:27:28,813

Derek Price: My
therapist would probably


755
0:27:43,595 --> 0:27:45,63
argue that the only
reason we run a


756
0:27:45,63 --> 0:27:46,665
restaurant at
Deadwood is I can


757
0:27:46,665 --> 0:27:48,533
kind of covertly prep.


758
0:27:48,533 --> 0:27:50,502

0:28:9,12 --> 0:28:11,79

In a post-apocalyptic

771
0:28:15,36 --> 0:28:18,83
I'll still be able to use
it to patrol our perimeter


772
0:28:18,83 --> 0:28:20,465
and move our goods
and services in and


773
0:28:20,465 --> 0:28:22,67

Unbeknownst to
the paying public,


787
0:28:52,697 --> 0:28:55,133
this is a series of

with lots of exits and


789
0:28:58,303 --> 0:29:0,605

we've modeled our business
around the Old West,


797
0:29:23,661 --> 0:29:26,831
and ah, nobody would
raise any eyebrows.


798
0:29:26,831 --> 0:29:31,302
I have this ability to

And now you know
my paranoia,


800
0:29:33,772 --> 0:29:36,875

me to take on a project

would take on.

A little bomb's alright.


817
0:30:14,646 --> 0:30:18,383
You'd have to shoot it 15,
20 times in a spot that

0:30:18,383 --> 0:30:21,352
big to maybe get
through that wall.


819
0:30:21,352 --> 0:30:23,555
And by that time
we can take action


820
0:30:23,555 --> 0:30:25,79
to, to, uh,
shut it down.

a flamethrower out.

because there's so
many uses for it.


877
0:32:44,762 --> 0:32:46,264
Daniel Price: We
originally wanted to


878
0:32:46,264 --> 0:32:48,967
use this as spears
and possibly blowguns,


879
0:32:48,967 --> 0:32:51,69
that's one of the oldest
weapons known to humans,


880
0:32:51,69 --> 0:32:54,305
but, uh, I wanted to make
lots and lots of spikes to


881
0:32:54,305 --> 0:32:56,708
cover your ditches and
those dead zones and


882
0:32:56,708 --> 0:32:58,776

stick their foot.

 line of defense.</i>


927
0:34:29,834 --> 0:34:32,403
Derek Price: We consider
our cannon probably our


928
0:34:32,403 --> 0:34:35,44
crown jewel of
defensive capabilities


929
0:34:35,44 --> 0:34:37,241
here at our fortress.


930
0:34:37,241 --> 0:34:39,31
Initially when we acquired
the cannon I think it


931
0:34:39,31 --> 0:34:41,846
was probably for
display purposes and


932
0:34:41,846 --> 0:34:44,882
by experimentation
with it we realized that


933
0:34:44,882 --> 0:34:47,652
we can defend a
very large area with


934
0:34:47,652 --> 0:34:50,54
a weapon like that.


935
0:34:50,54 --> 0:34:51,689
<i> Narrator: Derek's
 cannon is modeled on</i>


936
0:34:51,689 --> 0:34:54,892
<i> 19th century black-powder
 military cannons.</i>


937
0:34:54,892 --> 0:34:57,128
<i> During the day
 it shoots blanks</i>


938
0:34:57,128 --> 0:34:58,696
<i> for visitors' enjoyment.</i>


939
0:34:58,696 --> 0:35:1,65
<i> But today, for
 the first time,</i>


940
0:35:1,65 --> 0:35:2,934
<i> they are filling
 it with pellets to</i>


941
0:35:2,934 --> 0:35:5,336
<i> gauge its aim
 and range.</i>


942
0:35:5,336 --> 0:35:6,771
Daniel Price: Back
up about two feet,


943
0:35:6,771 --> 0:35:9,74
Haven, when
you sight it.


944
0:35:9,74 --> 0:35:11,642
You should only see
one circle at the front


945
0:35:11,642 --> 0:35:13,544
and nothing at the rear.


946
0:35:13,544 --> 0:35:14,812
Alright, there you go.


947
0:35:14,812 --> 0:35:18,916
Derek Price: Let's
go 10 seconds.


948
0:35:18,916 --> 0:35:20,451
Put that in there.


949
0:35:20,451 --> 0:35:23,121
Daniel Price:
Fire in the hole!


950
0:35:23,121 --> 0:35:24,21
Derek Price: Fire.


951
0:35:24,21 --> 0:35:28,159
Alright stand
back, guys.


952
0:35:28,159 --> 0:35:29,46
Hold on to your hats.


953
0:35:29,46 --> 0:35:33,498
Here we go.


954
0:35:33,498 --> 0:35:34,699
Or not.


955
0:35:34,699 --> 0:35:36,234
Let's be ready because
this could probably


956
0:35:36,234 --> 0:35:39,103
go off at any second
without any warning there.


957
0:35:39,103 --> 0:35:40,271
Stand back.


958
0:35:40,271 --> 0:35:41,873
Let me see if I can
prick it out with this.


959
0:35:41,873 --> 0:35:43,341
Daniel Price:
Wait, wait, wait.


960
0:35:43,341 --> 0:35:44,742
First tap the end of it.


961
0:35:44,742 --> 0:35:45,943
Derek Price: We're
gonna clear the fuse


962
0:35:45,943 --> 0:35:46,844
and refuse it.


963
0:35:46,844 --> 0:35:48,713
This is a bad
idea probably.


964
0:35:48,713 --> 0:35:50,681
Let's stand back.


965
0:35:50,681 --> 0:35:51,916
<i> Narrator: Derek is
 switching from a</i>


966
0:35:51,916 --> 0:35:55,453
<i> timed fuse to
 a pull fuse.</i>


967
0:35:55,453 --> 0:35:58,122
<i> If the cannon won't
 fire reliably this way,</i>


968
0:35:58,122 --> 0:35:59,657
<i> the family will
 have to refigure</i>


969
0:35:59,657 --> 0:36:2,26
<i> their entire
 defense plan.</i>


970
0:36:2,26 --> 0:36:4,128
Derek Price: We
are alive now.


971
0:36:4,128 --> 0:36:5,29
Okay.


972
0:36:5,29 --> 0:36:6,797
Daniel Price:
Test fire!


973
0:36:6,797 --> 0:36:9,467
Fire in the hole!


974
0:36:9,467 --> 0:36:10,468
Derek Price:
You ready?


975
0:36:10,468 --> 0:36:11,402
Here we go.


976
0:36:11,402 --> 0:36:15,64
3-2-1.


977
0:36:15,64 --> 0:36:18,242
Damn.


978
0:36:18,242 --> 0:36:19,777
Daniel Price: Boo-yah!


979
0:36:19,777 --> 0:36:21,12
That's what I'm
talking about.


980
0:36:21,12 --> 0:36:25,383
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.


981
0:36:25,383 --> 0:36:26,851
Wow, we've got
a spread of at least


982
0:36:26,851 --> 0:36:30,955
12 feet over a 40-feet
run right here with


983
0:36:30,955 --> 0:36:33,524
a lot of dead with
a lot of kill shots.


984
0:36:33,524 --> 0:36:35,393
Derek Price: This would
make a real bad day for


985
0:36:35,393 --> 0:36:38,763
anybody on the business
end of that cannon.


986
0:36:38,763 --> 0:36:40,164
<i> Narrator: Although
 they're pleased with the</i>


987
0:36:40,164 --> 0:36:42,233
<i> cannon's range, they've
 also learned that</i>


988
0:36:42,233 --> 0:36:45,603
<i> vintage weapons
 are unreliable.</i>


989
0:36:45,603 --> 0:36:47,438
Daniel Price: We
need to have three or


990
0:36:47,438 --> 0:36:48,806
four more of these.


991
0:36:48,806 --> 0:36:50,208
And so that way if
one doesn't fire,


992
0:36:50,208 --> 0:36:51,742
we still have two
to three more,


993
0:36:51,742 --> 0:36:53,211
with cross-sections
of fire,


994
0:36:53,211 --> 0:36:55,546
and I think that would be
the most effective thing.


995
0:36:55,546 --> 0:36:57,415
<i> Narrator: Derek believes
 defending Deadwood will</i>


996
0:36:57,415 --> 0:37:0,651
<i> require every member of
 the family to arm himself,</i>


997
0:37:0,651 --> 0:37:3,221
<i> even his 11-year-old
 son, Haven.</i>


998
0:37:3,221 --> 0:37:4,755
Derek Price:
Alright, Haven.


999
0:37:4,755 --> 0:37:6,457
We're gonna do a
perimeter sweep.


1000
0:37:6,457 --> 0:37:7,658
I'm gonna take
the south side,


1001
0:37:7,658 --> 0:37:8,626
you take the north side.


1002
0:37:8,626 --> 0:37:9,827
Okay?


1003
0:37:9,827 --> 0:37:11,262
<i> Narrator: In preparation
 for a world without</i>


1004
0:37:11,262 --> 0:37:13,97
<i> electricity, he's
 been training Haven</i>


1005
0:37:13,97 --> 0:37:16,167
<i> to patrol Deadwood in
 the dark of night.</i>


1006
0:37:16,167 --> 0:37:18,669
Haven Price: If a solar
flare were to happen,


1007
0:37:18,669 --> 0:37:21,906
probably every place would
end up looking like this.


1008
0:37:21,906 --> 0:37:23,674
Derek Price: I think
at some level it's


1009
0:37:23,674 --> 0:37:25,643
still an adventure
for him right now.


1010
0:37:25,643 --> 0:37:26,777
It's fun and games.


1011
0:37:26,777 --> 0:37:28,846
I mean, he knows
I'm carrying a


1012
0:37:28,846 --> 0:37:30,281
loaded weapon
at night.


1013
0:37:30,281 --> 0:37:32,16
So, you know, at
some level he


1014
0:37:32,16 --> 0:37:33,451
knows it's serious.


1015
0:37:33,451 --> 0:37:35,253
But you know, I don't
think it's set in


1016
0:37:35,253 --> 0:37:37,655
on him yet just how
serious I'm taking it.


1017
0:37:37,655 --> 0:37:39,257
Haven Price: I tell a few
of my friends, you know,


1018
0:37:39,257 --> 0:37:41,259
"My dad has a bunker
and everything.


1019
0:37:41,259 --> 0:37:42,827
So we're going to
be well protected.


1020
0:37:42,827 --> 0:37:45,129
So if the apocalypse
comes we'll be safe


1021
0:37:45,129 --> 0:37:50,568
and you won't!"


1022
0:37:50,568 --> 0:37:54,105
<i> Narrator: So far, Haven's
 only been on patrol.</i>


1023
0:37:54,105 --> 0:37:55,773
<i> But Derek wants him
 trained for what</i>


1024
0:37:55,773 --> 0:37:58,542
<i> he fears is the
 worst case scenario.</i>


1025
0:37:58,542 --> 0:38:2,246
<i> Multiple attackers descend
 on Deadwood town square.</i>


1026
0:38:2,246 --> 0:38:3,748
<i> Cannons fail.</i>


1027
0:38:3,748 --> 0:38:6,684
<i> The only option is a gun
 battle to the death.</i>


1028
0:38:6,684 --> 0:38:9,62
<i> So Derek's about to put
 the entire Price family,</i>


1029
0:38:9,62 --> 0:38:11,522
<i> and all of
 Deadwood's defenses,</i>


1030
0:38:11,522 --> 0:38:13,524
<i> through an extreme test.</i>


1031
0:38:13,524 --> 0:38:15,793
<i> And tonight, the
 youngest Price will</i>


1032
0:38:15,793 --> 0:38:17,428
<i> be on the front line.</i>


1033
0:38:17,428 --> 0:38:18,696
Haven Price: Stay
where you are.


1034
0:38:18,696 --> 0:38:25,97
Don't move.


1035
0:38:25,97 --> 0:38:27,238
<i> Narrator: Derek
 Price has built an</i>


1036
0:38:27,238 --> 0:38:29,273

<i> Tonight Derek, his father

1041
0:38:40,251 --> 0:38:44,755
<i> and practice driving back
 intruders from Deadwood.</i>


1042
0:38:44,755 --> 0:38:46,424
Daniel Price:
Gentleman, tonight we're


1043
0:38:46,424 --> 0:38:49,26
gonna be playing an
apocalyptic version of


1044
0:38:49,26 --> 0:38:52,396
shells versus skulls.


1045
0:38:52,396 --> 0:38:56,0
An opposing force versus
a defensive posture.


1046
0:38:56,0 --> 0:38:59,337
Between the hours
of 9 P.M. and 6A.M.


1047
0:38:59,337 --> 0:39:1,806
the three of us will
be out and about,


1048
0:39:1,806 --> 0:39:4,608
and we will try to attack
and take the dance hall


1049
0:39:4,608 --> 0:39:7,144
from your possession,
using whatever tactics


1050
0:39:7,144 --> 0:39:8,512
we deem necessary.


1051
0:39:8,512 --> 0:39:10,614
Your job is to
defend the dance hall


1052
0:39:10,614 --> 0:39:11,882
from our assault.


1053
0:39:11,882 --> 0:39:14,118
Are there any questions
before we begin?


1054
0:39:14,118 --> 0:39:16,754
Haven Price: Shells rule.


1055
0:39:16,754 --> 0:39:18,55
Derek Price:
Lock and load.


1056
0:39:18,55 --> 0:39:19,423
Let's go, guys.


1057
0:39:19,423 --> 0:39:21,258
<i> Narrator: The two teams
 are using real weapons,</i>


1058
0:39:21,258 --> 0:39:23,327
<i> but the safeties are on.</i>


1059
0:39:23,327 --> 0:39:25,963
<i> A kill will be determined
 by flashing the gun's</i>


1060
0:39:25,963 --> 0:39:29,1
<i> light on the victim
 for three seconds.</i>


1061
0:39:29,1 --> 0:39:30,868
Derek Price: I think if
you cover the left flank,


1062
0:39:30,868 --> 0:39:32,37
and Haven, if you take
the elevated position


1063
0:39:32,37 --> 0:39:33,871
at the top up there,
you can cover both of


1064
0:39:33,871 --> 0:39:36,173
those spots at
the same time.


1065
0:39:36,173 --> 0:39:37,675
Haven Price: Alright,
since I'm taking the


1066
0:39:37,675 --> 0:39:39,41
elevated position I'm
thinking I'm gonna go


1067
0:39:39,41 --> 0:39:41,145
with my assault
rifle instead of


1068
0:39:41,145 --> 0:39:42,213
this four-ten here.


1069
0:39:42,213 --> 0:39:43,481
Derek Price:
Okay, that's fine.


1070
0:39:43,481 --> 0:39:45,182
<i> Narrator: While Derek's
 team plots their strategy</i>


1071
0:39:45,182 --> 0:39:47,451
<i> to hold the dancehall,
 Daniel's team of</i>


1072
0:39:47,451 --> 0:39:51,122
<i> Deadwood employees is
 throwing out the rulebook.</i>


1073
0:39:51,122 --> 0:39:52,923
Daniel Price: If you're
playing by the rules,


1074
0:39:52,923 --> 0:39:54,558
you need to change
your tactics.


1075
0:39:54,558 --> 0:39:58,28
They're expecting
three of us, not four.


1076
0:39:58,28 --> 0:40:0,131
They have to see us.


1077
0:40:0,131 --> 0:40:1,932
They do not
have to see her.


1078
0:40:1,932 --> 0:40:3,901
In fact, I don't even
want you to make your


1079
0:40:3,901 --> 0:40:5,836
appearance known until
you're positive at


1080
0:40:5,836 --> 0:40:8,172
least one or all
of us are dead.


1081
0:40:8,172 --> 0:40:9,673
So we've got
our advantage.


1082
0:40:9,673 --> 0:40:11,509
Derek is our
primary target.


1083
0:40:11,509 --> 0:40:13,978
Without that leadership,
Haven will go into


1084
0:40:13,978 --> 0:40:16,814
complete shock that his
dad has been taken out


1085
0:40:16,814 --> 0:40:17,748
and neutralized.


1086
0:40:17,748 --> 0:40:18,582
Live well.


1087
0:40:18,582 --> 0:40:19,483
Die hard.


1088
0:40:19,483 --> 0:40:25,589
Let's do it.


1089
0:40:25,589 --> 0:40:27,191
Ira Price: They're both
trying to outsmart each


1090
0:40:27,191 --> 0:40:32,29
other, and, uh, Daniel,
Daniel is pretty sneaky.


1091
0:40:32,29 --> 0:40:33,597
He'll take an hour.


1092
0:40:33,597 --> 0:40:44,175
He's patient.


1093
0:40:44,175 --> 0:40:45,309
Haven Price: Dad,
got movement on


1094
0:40:45,309 --> 0:40:46,343
the right flank.


1095
0:40:46,343 --> 0:40:47,845
But I think it
may be a decoy.


1096
0:40:47,845 --> 0:40:50,8
I know, I know what
Uncle Dan does.


1097
0:40:50,8 --> 0:40:51,515
Stay where you are.


1098
0:40:51,515 --> 0:40:53,35
Don't move.


1099
0:40:53,35 --> 0:41:1,292
Derek Price: Alright,
I'm in position.


1100
0:41:1,292 --> 0:41:2,827
Haven Price: Someone's
making a noise.


1101
0:41:2,827 --> 0:41:5,95
Somebody's trying
to distract us.


1102
0:41:5,95 --> 0:41:6,53
Granddad, I need cover.


1103
0:41:6,53 --> 0:41:16,24
Over.


1104
0:41:16,24 --> 0:41:21,45
Derek Price: You're dead.


1105
0:41:21,45 --> 0:41:29,92
Haven Price:
Somebody hit Daniel.


1106
0:41:29,92 --> 0:41:47,705
Gotcha!


1107
0:41:47,705 --> 0:41:49,73
Derek Price: You're dead.


1108
0:41:49,73 --> 0:41:54,879
That's three!


1109
0:41:54,879 --> 0:41:56,647
Girl: You're dead!


1110
0:41:56,647 --> 0:41:58,883
Derek Price:
Son of a bitch.


1111
0:41:58,883 --> 0:42:0,217
Daniel Price: Well, that
was pretty fun guys.


1112
0:42:0,217 --> 0:42:2,319
<i> Narrator: The team led by
 Derek and Haven seemed to</i>


1113
0:42:2,319 --> 0:42:5,55
<i> have the advantage, but
 not expecting Daniel's ace</i>


1114
0:42:5,55 --> 0:42:8,125
<i> in the hole ultimately led
 to Derek being killed,</i>


1115
0:42:8,125 --> 0:42:9,86
<i> and the team
 losing the drill.</i>


1116
0:42:9,86 --> 0:42:11,562
Derek Price: Trusting my
brother would follow the


1117
0:42:11,562 --> 0:42:13,364
rules was a bad idea.


1118
0:42:13,364 --> 0:42:15,132
And you know, he got me.


1119
0:42:15,132 --> 0:42:17,1
But, you know,
that's a valuable


1120
0:42:17,1 --> 0:42:18,102
lesson to learn,
you know.


1121
0:42:18,102 --> 0:42:20,371
There's no such thing
as a fair fight.


1122
0:42:20,371 --> 0:42:21,872
Daniel Price: The major
improvements I see is


1123
0:42:21,872 --> 0:42:23,741
we've got to make it a
lot more difficult for


1124
0:42:23,741 --> 0:42:26,277
somebody just to walk in
and get this close to us.


1125
0:42:26,277 --> 0:42:27,845
We need to know
long before they're


1126
0:42:27,845 --> 0:42:29,13
in our perimeter.


1127
0:42:29,13 --> 0:42:31,248
We need to know exactly
how many there are.


1128
0:42:31,248 --> 0:42:33,651
Tonight they expected
three, there were four.


1129
0:42:33,651 --> 0:42:36,22
A fourth person came
into the very center


1130
0:42:36,22 --> 0:42:38,422
of Deadwood and was
not even detected.


1131
0:42:38,422 --> 0:42:40,9
Derek Price: She's the
stealthiest one out here.


1132
0:42:40,9 --> 0:42:41,859
She's a natural
born killer.


1133
0:42:41,859 --> 0:42:44,662
You know just from talking
to my employees and


1134
0:42:44,662 --> 0:42:47,331
I know that they know
what I'm doing and


1135
0:42:47,331 --> 0:42:49,66
some of 'em openly
can't hide the


1136
0:42:49,66 --> 0:42:50,935
fact they think
I've completely


1137
0:42:50,935 --> 0:42:53,971
lost my mind, but
you know what?


1138
0:42:53,971 --> 0:42:55,205
If it's the end
of the world,


1139
0:42:55,205 --> 0:42:57,241
you need to knock on
somebody else's door


1140
0:42:57,241 --> 0:42:58,509
'cause mine's
going to be shut.


1141
0:42:58,509 --> 0:43:1,745
I didn't spend all my
money, all my time,


1142
0:43:1,745 --> 0:43:5,249
sacrificing so much to
just open my door to


1143
0:43:5,249 --> 0:43:7,918
somebody that laughed
at me the whole


1144
0:43:7,918 --> 0:43:9,553
time I was doing it.


1145
0:43:9,553 --> 0:43:15,859
Nah, it doesn't
work that way.


1146
0:43:15,859 --> 0:43:17,428
<i> Narrator: Derek,

1151
0:43:25,469 --> 0:43:26,37
Daniel Price: Respect.


1152
0:43:26,37 --> 0:43:28,138
Derek Price: Thank
you, absolutely.


1153
0:43:28,138 --> 0:43:30,4
<i> Narrator: However, you
 currently do not have</i>


1154
0:43:30,4 --> 0:43:33,277
<i> adequate stored water
 to sustain your family.</i>


1155
0:43:33,277 --> 0:43:34,578
Derek Price: I didn't
feel the need to


1156
0:43:34,578 --> 0:43:37,14
waste my storage
space storing water,


1157
0:43:37,14 --> 0:43:40,584
when I can easily
filter water.


1158

0:44:9,58 --> 0:44:12,783

<i> You have 12 months

1170
0:44:15,319 --> 0:44:16,353
Derek Price:
I'm gonna agree.


1171
0:44:16,353 --> 0:44:17,721
The first year would
probably be the


1172
0:44:17,721 --> 0:44:19,189
easiest as far as food.


1173
0:44:19,189 --> 0:44:20,724
But, uh, I plan
on being around


1174
0:44:20,724 --> 0:44:22,359
a lot longer
than one year.


1175
0:44:22,359 --> 0:44:26,23
Daniel Price: Absolutely.


1176
0:44:26,23 --> 0:44:27,765
Derek Price: Since the
film crew was here we've


1177
0:44:27,765 --> 0:44:29,667
begun Phase Two of our
construction on the


1178
0:44:29,667 --> 0:44:31,702
fortress there, which
includes our kitchen


1179
0:44:31,702 --> 0:44:35,72
complex and self-contained
water supply.


1180
0:44:35,72 --> 0:44:36,54
Ira Price: It took
less than two hours


1181
0:44:36,54 --> 0:44:38,709
to put this pump in.


1182
0:44:38,709 --> 0:44:40,477
We have all the
water we need.


1183
0:44:40,477 --> 0:44:44,314
Ah, yes.


1184
0:44:44,314 --> 0:44:46,583
