###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Morals, fairness, vengeance, we see people display these things all the
###5 time, but there is scientists who think it`s all a bunch of monkey business. You`re going
###9 to find out why. I`m Carl Azuz. Welcome to CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###24 We`ve been talking about some of the traditional events involved in the presidential inauguration.
###30 Another one happened on Tuesday morning, the inaugural prayer service. The president, First
###35 Lady Michelle Obama and about 2200 other people went to the interfaith service at the National
###40 Cathedral. Now, by interfaith, we mean, it involved different religions. Yesterday`s
###45 service included prayers and readings for members of the Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox
###50 Christian as well as Jewish, Islamic and Sikh faiths. The tradition of the inaugural prayer
###55 service started with George Washington. It`s been held at the National Cathedral since
###60 1985.

###60 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We will respond to the threat
###63 of climate change. Knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future
###69 generations.
###69 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###71 AZUZ: That was part of President Obama`s inaugural speech on Monday. He mentioned some of the
###75 issues that are going to be part of his second term agenda. What he hopes to get done during
###79 the next four years.
###81 Some of the issues are holdovers from his first term, trying to lower the country`s
###85 debt. Working on immigration reform. Other issues are new for him like gun control. On
###90 our blog, some of you shared your expectations for President Obama`s second term.
###95 Antonio said "I hope to see a more stable economy and a more united nation rather than
###99 a nation that`s divided on political and social issues."
###103 Maddie wants to see that we lower our debt and stop depending on countries like China
###107 for the things we need.
###108 John lists immigration reform, gun control and the debt ceiling.
###113 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###115 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can ID me. I`m a European country that`s between France,
###123 Germany and Italy. I didn`t get involved in either world war. I`m known for tourism, banking
###129 and watches. And my capital is Bern.
###131 I`m Switzerland. A country that`s home to around 8 million people.
###140 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###142 AZUZ: Davos is the resort city in the Swiss mountains. That`s not why we are talking about
###147 it. It`s because this week, like every year, Davos is hosting the World Economic Forum.
###152 This is a group that brings together business leaders, political leaders and other influential
###157 folks. They are going to be talking about global economic issues like the debt crisis
###161 and high unemployment rates across parts of Europe. Or the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling
###166 debates in Washington. The group also brainstorms possible solutions, like creating a bailout
###171 fund or coming up with ways for governments to reduce their debt. Richard Quest now has
###177 an analogy comparing some of the economic issues that will be discussed at Davos to
###181 a popular pastime.
###182 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###184 RICHARD QUEST, CNN CORRESPONDENT: On the mountain, risk is everywhere. And the lessons ...
###191 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whoever skies, parallel ....
###193 QUEST: Newitt (ph) has been a ski instructor for years. He knows that on the mountain and
###200 in the global economy, it`s all about balance.
###205 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have to move with the bump, and take it.
###208 QUEST: So far, we`ve navigated the bump of the fiscal cliff. Now, we must negotiate the
###215 debt ceiling, high unemployment, social unrest. Again, we learn from the mountain - baby steps
###224 to build confidence.
###224 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But if we ski slowly, we feel what we are doing and then we get confident
###232 and we get faster and faster.
###235 QUEST: But economic growth seemingly won`t go faster.
###241 There`s always the risk in the global economy that something goes wrong.
###251 Snowboarders, they have their own way of shredding down the mountain. It`s brutal economics.
###258 (on camera): What`s the secret to snowboarding?
###263 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don`t be scared.
###265 QUEST: You pick speed too quickly, and you end up falling over.
###268 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, come on, like, that`s why you need to move.
###272 QUEST: Why do you like snowboarding?
###274 (LAUGHTER)
###274 QUEST: You go too fast, too quickly and fall over?
###280 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not necessarily.
###283 QUEST (voice over): Perhaps, the best lesson to be learned in managing risk comes from
###289 the cross-country skier. Those hardy experts of slow, steady progress taking huge amounts
###297 of energy.
###298 As the map of the mountain shows, everything is interconnected. And that will be on the
###305 minds of the participants in Davos as they analyze today`s global risks.
###312 Richard Quest, CNN, Davos.
###314 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###315 AZUZ: All right. Thanks, Richard. Jackie Chisolm (ph) is a teacher in Florida. She said, after
###322 last month shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School an idea came to her - she thought we
###327 buy back guns, why not buy back video games and DVDs? That`s what she started doing. We
###333 are talking specifically about violent games and DVDs. She offered students a chance to
###338 trade in their violent video games. For each one they turn in, students get money back.
###344 The teacher is paying for it out of her own money, and she believes that violence in games
###347 and movies can affect the actions of the people playing or watching them. That`s why she started
###352 this buyback idea. As some folks will agree with this, some folks won`t, so we are asking
###358 about it on our blog today at cnnstudentnews.com. Do you think that playing violent video games
###363 or watching violent movies contributes to violent behavior? Talk to us on our blog.
###368 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###369 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Mr. Biggs` STAR class at Hoech Middle
###374 School in St. Louis, Missouri. Baboons and chimpanzees are both part of which of these
###380 groups? Here we go, are they both: apes, monkeys, primates or troglodytes? You`ve got three
###386 seconds, go!
###387 Baboons are monkeys, chimps are apes, and both are primates. That`s your answer and
###400 that`s your "Shoutout."
###402 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###404 AZUZ: The oldest and largest primate center in the U.S. is in Atlanta, Georgia. Some researchers
###410 there studying things like morality, also, reciprocity, the idea that if I give you something,
###415 you`ll give me something back that`s about the same. These could be considered some high
###419 level concepts, but these scientists think the monkeys and apes they work with, get it.
###423 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###424 FRANS DE WAAL: A morality is usually considered a uniquely humane domain, and maybe it is
###430 in some ways, but I think morality also has elements of empathy and compassion, on the
###434 one hand, reciprocity and fairness. And all of these elements we can see in other primates.
###442 We do, for example, studies on fairness. Are they sensitive to getting less than somebody
###447 else, or more than somebody else? We do studies on yawn contagion, how they are affected by
###451 the yawns of others, like humans are? You know.
###453 Well, yawn contagion is interesting because we know in humans it correlates with empathy.
###457 If you are very sensitive to the yawns of others, you are usually also a very empathic
###463 person. And we study it by giving chimpanzees a little video that they can watch, and on
###469 the video they see a yawning chimpanzee. And then we see what they do, of course. And what
###473 we find is that if the chimpanzee that they see on the video is one that they know, they
###477 are going to be yawning more. If it`s someone that they don`t know, so a stranger, they
###482 are unaffected by it.
###483 Reciprocity, we`ve done studies of where we give, for example, one chimpanzee a lot of
###490 food, and then see how that chimpanzee shares with others, and then we do another occasion
###495 and see if the ones who have received from this chimp are willing to return the favor.
###499 And chimpanzees do, chimpanzees do keep favors in mind, but also negative actions, like humans,
###505 they also take revenge. Well, for example if chimpanzee has lost a fight to several
###509 others, he may wait for an occasion to get even with these individuals individually.
###514 So, reciprocity is a basic element, fairness in dividing resources also basic element of
###521 human society. And if you can recognize these elements in animals like chimpanzees who are
###526 also closely related to us, that means that that characteristic is probably quite old.
###530 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###531 AZUZ: Well, as far as we know, David Parsons isn`t angry with anyone. But he is asking
###537 everyone to hug it out. Everyone he can find in a 24-hour period. Parsons is aiming for
###544 a world record: the most hugs by one person in one day. His amiable affection isn`t aimless.
###549 He`s hoping his hugs raise money for an organization that helps kids fighting cancer. He set up
###555 shot on Monday, and, of course, he didn`t turn away anyone who got in line. When you`re
###559 trying for this kind of record, you can`t afford to keep anyone in arm`s length. You
###563 just give yourself over to the experience, you know, really embrace it. I think we have
###567 squeezed every drop of pun we can out of this one. So we`re going to wrap things up and
###570 see you back again tomorrow for more CNN STUDENT NEWS. Bye-bye.
