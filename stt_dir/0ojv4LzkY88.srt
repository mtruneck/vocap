0:0:24,477 --> 0:0:28,837
'Life's all pain.
Pain, rejection and gloom.


2
0:0:28,837 --> 0:0:33,277
'Why do we pretend there's not
a yawning blankness at the heart of...


3
0:0:33,277 --> 0:0:38,277
'Hey, 330/0 extra free.
I am doing excellent shopping.


4
0:0:38,277 --> 0:0:42,557
'My depression means
I'm being even more frugal than normal. '


5
0:0:42,557 --> 0:0:44,717
- Mark!
- Hey, Jeremy.


6
0:0:44,717 --> 0:0:48,437
You realise tinned food
is just for crackheads and wars?


7
0:0:48,437 --> 0:0:50,277
Oh, no, mate,


8
0:0:50,277 --> 0:0:54,717
- this stuff's 78 pence a 100ml.
- Yeah, it's first pressing.


9
0:0:54,717 --> 0:0:58,997
You don't wait until everyone else
has had fun with the olives.


10
0:0:58,997 --> 0:1:2,317
Fourth pressing,
that's a party in your mouth!


11
0:1:2,317 --> 0:1:4,917
Look, we've been through this before,


12
0:1:4,917 --> 0:1:9,997
I do the joint shopping solo because
I don't make impulse purchases and...


13
0:1:9,997 --> 0:1:13,117
Mark! I'm not shopping,
I just came to tell you


14
0:1:13,117 --> 0:1:16,277
that we've been invited
to a very wicked party.


15
0:1:16,277 --> 0:1:20,157
Do I look like a man who goes to
wicked parties? Ask Toni.


16
0:1:20,157 --> 0:1:22,197
I did, actually, but she said no.


17
0:1:22,197 --> 0:1:24,877
But it's better this way - two lads.


18
0:1:24,877 --> 0:1:28,437
We've got to get out there,
grooving, doing it, you know?


19
0:1:28,437 --> 0:1:30,877
It's been a long time for either of us.


20
0:1:30,877 --> 0:1:34,357
I haven't had my oats
in something like... two weeks.


21
0:1:34,357 --> 0:1:36,357
'Nine months and 13 days. '


22
0:1:36,357 --> 0:1:39,997
Look, people will think
we spend the whole time wanking.


23
0:1:39,997 --> 0:1:43,237
Don't be ridiculous,
they're for wiping up mess.


24
0:1:43,237 --> 0:1:46,277
Yeah, man mess.
That's why they're mansize.


25
0:1:46,277 --> 0:1:51,917
They're for men -
men's noses, big manly snot.


26
0:1:51,917 --> 0:1:54,837
Oh, Mark, come on, man, let it go.


27
0:1:54,837 --> 0:1:56,277
What?


28
0:1:56,277 --> 0:2:1,357
Why do you have to have a huge can
of lager that makes you really drunk?


29
0:2:1,357 --> 0:2:5,317
What if you want to get
Sophie home and get her all lathered up?


30
0:2:5,317 --> 0:2:7,357
That's not going to happen.


31
0:2:7,357 --> 0:2:10,317
- Oh, shit, did you...?
- Mm-hm.


32
0:2:10,317 --> 0:2:12,437
And she...?


33
0:2:12,437 --> 0:2:16,677
I mean, it's not a date or anything
because I've got a mega-pass.


34
0:2:16,677 --> 0:2:18,757
How do you feel about row G?


35
0:2:18,757 --> 0:2:21,237
- Tonight?
- Yeah, I thought...


36
0:2:21,237 --> 0:2:25,317
Oh, Mark, listen, I'm sorry,
I'd love to but, er...


37
0:2:25,317 --> 0:2:27,357
I've got this... thing.


38
0:2:27,357 --> 0:2:32,397
Oh, man, I'm... But listen, this is the
perfect time to get back in the game.


39
0:2:32,397 --> 0:2:37,397
You know? Two guys,
together, out, looking for... it.


40
0:2:37,397 --> 0:2:39,357
No, thank you.


41
0:2:39,357 --> 0:2:43,957
How much pain can I experience at home
with spaghetti carbonara and Das Boot?


42
0:2:43,957 --> 0:2:48,477
Look, it's Friday night, most people
don't do their shopping now,


43
0:2:48,477 --> 0:2:51,437
- they're out right now.
- Right. No queues.


44
0:2:51,437 --> 0:2:58,837
So who exactly is winning, eh?


45
0:2:58,837 --> 0:3:3,77
'OK, well, I'm here
so I'll just sit here and drink.


46
0:3:3,77 --> 0:3:5,197
'No one can stop me doing that.


47
0:3:5,197 --> 0:3:9,197
'Just drink myself to death.


48
0:3:9,197 --> 0:3:13,797
'I bet he gets sex tonight
and I have to listen to it through the wall.


49
0:3:13,797 --> 0:3:18,757
'Maybe she might go to the bathroom
and accidentally come into my room.


50
0:3:18,757 --> 0:3:22,917
'And what? She fucks you?
No, she says "whoops" and goes out.


51
0:3:22,917 --> 0:3:24,917
'Stop doing this to yourself. '


52
0:3:24,917 --> 0:3:27,357
So, safe party, yeah?


53
0:3:27,357 --> 0:3:29,637
Super safe!


54
0:3:29,637 --> 0:3:32,77
'OK, playing it cool, huh?


55
0:3:32,77 --> 0:3:36,397
'All right, how about I go
a little Oscar Wilde on your ass? '


56
0:3:36,397 --> 0:3:38,837
I always go for the first pressing.


57
0:3:38,837 --> 0:3:45,117
I mean, why wait until everyone else
has had fun with the olives, right?


58
0:3:45,117 --> 0:3:48,437
'What's her problem?
This is the 21 st century.


59
0:3:48,437 --> 0:3:53,37
'Olive oil is an acceptable topic. '


60
0:3:53,37 --> 0:3:55,317
'Someone here's got psoriasis.


61
0:3:55,317 --> 0:3:59,317
'One of the less common skin ailments.
Yeast infection.


62
0:3:59,317 --> 0:4:3,837
'Thrush if you're thinking glamorous,
athlete's foot if you're not.

0:4:3,837 --> 0:4:6,677
'A fellow migraine sufferer.

'Everyone at this party isn't as young,
fit and single as they make out.

0:4:11,597 --> 0:4:15,437
'Let's face it,
we're all falling apart piece by piece.


66
0:4:15,437 --> 0:4:18,917
'Doesn't matter if you're single
or in a couple,


67
0:4:18,917 --> 0:4:25,437
'you... are... going... to... die. '


68
0:4:25,437 --> 0:4:28,77
Er... frozen stuff.


69
0:4:28,77 --> 0:4:35,357
I, er, don't want them to, you know, thaw.


70
0:4:35,357 --> 0:4:39,277
Hey! You got Findus Crispy Pancakes -
I love them!


71
0:4:39,277 --> 0:4:43,277
They're just so... disgusting, aren't they?


72
0:4:43,277 --> 0:4:44,957
Er, yeah.


73
0:4:44,957 --> 0:4:49,397
My sister, who's a smackhead,
I ended up there for Christmas dinner


74
0:4:49,397 --> 0:4:55,237
and we had turkey Findus Crispy
Pancakes. I wanted to kill myself.


75
0:4:55,237 --> 0:4:59,37
That would be the natural reaction.


76
0:4:59,37 --> 0:5:3,317
- Can I have a jam doughnut?
- Er, yeah, sure.


77
0:5:3,317 --> 0:5:6,77
So who are you trying to bone tonight?


78
0:5:6,77 --> 0:5:11,717
Oh, I'm not in the game. If I can get
my shopping home intact I'll be happy.


79
0:5:11,717 --> 0:5:13,917
Just like, be honest about it.


80
0:5:13,917 --> 0:5:17,317
I mean, let's line up, two naked rows,


81
0:5:17,317 --> 0:5:20,597
best-looking people
can pick the best-looking,


82
0:5:20,597 --> 0:5:23,917
the dregs get the dregs
and we can get it over with.


83
0:5:23,917 --> 0:5:27,317
That's a very attractive system
you're proposing.


84
0:5:27,317 --> 0:5:32,317
And it saves them having to humiliate
themselves. Check out this guy.


85
0:5:32,317 --> 0:5:38,597
Yeah.


86
0:5:38,597 --> 0:5:42,237
'Knew this would pay off.
Talking's bullshit.


87
0:5:42,237 --> 0:5:45,997
"'Yeah, I did this. I go there. "


88
0:5:45,997 --> 0:5:49,997
'OK, there's a new guy in town.
Probably just a friend.


89
0:5:49,997 --> 0:5:54,877
'Yeah. Me, her and her friend.
Kind of nice really.


90
0:5:54,877 --> 0:5:57,877
'H-Hey! That's a foul! Fuck!


91
0:5:57,877 --> 0:6:1,37
'God, she must be loving this.
I feel so cheap.


92
0:6:1,37 --> 0:6:3,557
'I really thought we had something. '


93
0:6:3,557 --> 0:6:11,597
So you work in an office and you've got,
like, your computer and your desk...


94
0:6:11,597 --> 0:6:13,637
God, that is so fucking weird!


95
0:6:13,637 --> 0:6:16,877
Yeah, well, you know,
everything's decaying,


96
0:6:16,877 --> 0:6:20,317
so the way I see it
has there ever been a better time


97
0:6:20,317 --> 0:6:22,917
to save up for a very comfortable sofa?


98
0:6:22,917 --> 0:6:27,197
'She's a teenager, Mark.
You'll get castrated by the menfolk.


99
0:6:27,197 --> 0:6:29,277
'Maybe she's a...


100
0:6:29,277 --> 0:6:32,477
- 'Oh, God. '
- Hey! Love the suit!


101
0:6:32,477 --> 0:6:35,157
Are you selling insurance?


102
0:6:35,157 --> 0:6:39,157
No need to look like you're sittin'
on a brush, man, we're only razzin' ya.


103
0:6:39,157 --> 0:6:41,197
? We are the mods
? We are the mods


104
0:6:41,197 --> 0:6:45,197
? We are, we are, we are the mods?


105
0:6:45,197 --> 0:6:48,957
My brother is such a dickhead.
I wish he was dead.


106
0:6:48,957 --> 0:6:55,997
That's a bit much. Just pretend
you need his bone marrow. That's agony.


107
0:6:55,997 --> 0:7:1,157
'She's snogging him already.
The dream is over, I am detritus. '


108
0:7:1,157 --> 0:7:5,77
Hey, Jez! I just wanted to tell you,
we're going.


109
0:7:5,77 --> 0:7:7,597
- To the Lazer Bowl.
- The Lazer Bowl?


110
0:7:7,597 --> 0:7:11,157
Yeah, me and Valerie.
We were gonna kill her brother


111
0:7:11,157 --> 0:7:14,277
but we thought the Lazer Bowl
would be more fun.


112
0:7:14,277 --> 0:7:17,397
Me, you and Valerie
are going to the Lazer Bowl?


113
0:7:17,397 --> 0:7:21,77
I hadn't thought you would be.
See you later at home?


114
0:7:21,77 --> 0:7:24,437
Do you think...
Would you mind taking the shopping?


115
0:7:24,437 --> 0:7:27,717
I've left some stuff
in the freezer compartment.


116
0:7:27,717 --> 0:7:30,637
Hey, maybe I could
bring someone along?


117
0:7:30,637 --> 0:7:33,797
Er... I mean...


118
0:7:33,797 --> 0:7:36,37
- I guess.
- I'll call Toni.


119
0:7:36,37 --> 0:7:38,997
Yeah, no, this is perfect, cos I'll just say,


120
0:7:38,997 --> 0:7:43,757
"Hey, me, Mark and Valerie are off down
the Lazer Bowl, do you wanna come?"


121
0:7:43,757 --> 0:7:51,477
- And she'll be, like, "Hell, yeah!"
- You think so?


122
0:7:51,477 --> 0:7:54,877
So he was all,
you want a piece of the action?


123
0:7:54,877 --> 0:8:0,877
And I was all, hell, yeah! I mean,
this is definitely not the rehearsal.


124
0:8:0,877 --> 0:8:4,797
Why not go to the Lazer Bowl
with the kid next door?


125
0:8:4,797 --> 0:8:8,237
'I've got to take
Jeremy's advice more often.


126
0:8:8,237 --> 0:8:13,477
'I'm on a date with a teenage goth,
smoking pot in the Lazer Bowl toilets.


127
0:8:13,477 --> 0:8:16,237
'This is it. This is literally it.


128
0:8:16,237 --> 0:8:21,37
'This is what people do
when they're having a good time. '


129
0:8:21,37 --> 0:8:23,437
Um... er... I don't know.


130
0:8:23,437 --> 0:8:25,517
It's good stuff, Mark.


131
0:8:25,517 --> 0:8:33,517
I strongly advise you to toke it.


132
0:8:33,517 --> 0:8:36,437
Erm, do you want me
to give you blowback?


133
0:8:36,437 --> 0:8:38,77
What, here?


134
0:8:38,77 --> 0:8:40,757
'Oh, my God, it's the last days of Rome! '


135
0:8:40,757 --> 0:8:49,397
Sure, open your mouth and breathe in
when I click my fingers.


136
0:8:49,397 --> 0:8:51,197
Wow!


137
0:8:51,197 --> 0:8:55,397
'I've been initiated. I am a drug user.
Fuck the police! '


138
0:8:55,397 --> 0:8:58,157
This is it, mate. We're having it.


139
0:8:58,157 --> 0:9:1,37
Jez, the faces, the faces.


140
0:9:1,37 --> 0:9:3,397
I feel... strange.


141
0:9:3,397 --> 0:9:5,997
Do you? Follow the fingers...


142
0:9:5,997 --> 0:9:8,157
Don't poke my eyes! Don't poke my eyes!


143
0:9:8,157 --> 0:9:11,237
- Are you getting visuals?
- What if I lose it?


144
0:9:11,237 --> 0:9:13,477
I'm not gonna do a poo, am I, Jez?


145
0:9:13,477 --> 0:9:17,277
Of course not.
Look, everything's going brilliantly.


146
0:9:17,277 --> 0:9:19,717
We've got to work together as a team.


147
0:9:19,717 --> 0:9:23,637
Work things up into a bit of a lather,
yeah? Follow my lead.


148
0:9:23,637 --> 0:9:27,757
'Jez is so great. He's like an idiot savant
but not so stupid.


149
0:9:27,757 --> 0:9:32,37
'I bet he's totally sorting
this whole night for us right now. '


150
0:9:32,37 --> 0:9:36,77
'I could say we've got huge cocks -
might be the clincher. '


151
0:9:36,77 --> 0:9:38,197
This is great, isn't it?


152
0:9:38,197 --> 0:9:40,797
This is so... it.


153
0:9:40,797 --> 0:9:44,237
I am having a just great time.


154
0:9:44,237 --> 0:9:47,117
Great!


155
0:9:47,117 --> 0:9:51,557
So, girls, what's the weirdest place
you've ever...


156
0:9:51,557 --> 0:9:53,837
done it.


157
0:9:53,837 --> 0:9:58,117
I had a steward eat me at Dubai airport.
God, that was depressing.


158
0:9:58,117 --> 0:10:0,277
Yeah, right.


159
0:10:0,277 --> 0:10:2,277
Valerie, how about you?


160
0:10:2,277 --> 0:10:4,597
I believe true love waits.


161
0:10:4,597 --> 0:10:7,557
Uh-huh, yeah. Me too.


162
0:10:7,557 --> 0:10:10,477
Er, Jesus, I'm kidding.


163
0:10:10,477 --> 0:10:13,557
Yeah, right, obviously, no.


164
0:10:13,557 --> 0:10:16,77
Me too.


165
0:10:16,77 --> 0:10:20,357
OK, so, what's everyone's
favourite record?


166
0:10:20,357 --> 0:10:22,997
Jesus, what was all that about?


167
0:10:22,997 --> 0:10:25,957
I guess she just
really likes Sledgehammer.


168
0:10:25,957 --> 0:10:28,437
I mean, that's a shit song, right?


169
0:10:28,437 --> 0:10:29,877
Yeah.


170
0:10:29,877 --> 0:10:31,917
'Forgive me, Peter. '


171
0:10:31,917 --> 0:10:34,557
- I mean, it's so outdated.
- Exactly!


172
0:10:34,557 --> 0:10:38,77
And suddenly I'm up in front
of the middle-aged court


173
0:10:38,77 --> 0:10:40,757
for crimes against being an old fucker.


174
0:10:40,757 --> 0:10:44,637
What's her problem?
I've never heard of Level 42 either.


175
0:10:44,637 --> 0:10:49,997
'Guys, I'm so sorry. '


176
0:10:49,997 --> 0:10:53,517
Hey, gutter boy,
you are allowed to hit the pins!


177
0:10:53,517 --> 0:10:57,77
- You are?
- In some bowling alleys it's encouraged.


178
0:10:57,77 --> 0:10:59,77
I didn't want to disturb them.


179
0:10:59,77 --> 0:11:1,917
That's kind of you, quite the gentleman.


180
0:11:1,917 --> 0:11:8,837
Hey, spread 'em!


181
0:11:8,837 --> 0:11:10,277
Wah-hoo!


182
0:11:10,277 --> 0:11:12,757
'Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. '


183
0:11:12,757 --> 0:11:16,437
- Hi, Mark
- Hi, Sophie, er...


184
0:11:16,437 --> 0:11:20,477
- This is Valerie.
- Hi.


185
0:11:20,477 --> 0:11:23,597
- How's it going?
- Good, thanks, and you two?


186
0:11:23,597 --> 0:11:25,917
Oh, yeah, yeah, fine. Er...


187
0:11:25,917 --> 0:11:28,437
I... Valerie and I, er...


188
0:11:28,437 --> 0:11:31,397
I mean, we just met at a party


189
0:11:31,397 --> 0:11:35,757
and we thought, you know,
we'd come here for a few... bowls.


190
0:11:35,757 --> 0:11:37,797
And I'm high, obviously.


191
0:11:37,797 --> 0:11:39,797
How about you?


192
0:11:39,797 --> 0:11:41,917
- I've been with Jeff.
- Jeff?!


193
0:11:41,917 --> 0:11:45,717
All right, Mark.


194
0:11:45,717 --> 0:11:49,957
'This should be in the bag.
Why isn't this in the bag?


195
0:11:49,957 --> 0:11:51,997
'She looks like she hates me. '


196
0:11:51,997 --> 0:11:55,77
What? It's "eat as much
as you can," you know.


197
0:11:55,77 --> 0:11:58,37
No, it's "eat as much as you like".


198
0:11:58,37 --> 0:12:0,477
There's no competitive element implied.


199
0:12:0,477 --> 0:12:2,957
At 3.99 I think I know who's winning.


200
0:12:2,957 --> 0:12:5,597
How dare she criticise Peter Gabriel.


201
0:12:5,597 --> 0:12:9,877
With her little "screw me" haircut,
and all so nee-nee-nee-ee.


202
0:12:9,877 --> 0:12:12,237
He single-handedly created WOMAD.


203
0:12:12,237 --> 0:12:16,517
'Oh, God, please stop talking
about Peter Gabriel. '


204
0:12:16,517 --> 0:12:17,997
Uh-huh.


205
0:12:17,997 --> 0:12:22,757
I can't believe it, I'm on a double-date
with guys from the office.


206
0:12:22,757 --> 0:12:24,797
It's like being on Friends.


207
0:12:24,797 --> 0:12:26,957
Yeah, this is great.


208
0:12:26,957 --> 0:12:31,37
So do you guys
get pissed at the Christmas party


209
0:12:31,37 --> 0:12:33,77
and photocopy your arses?


210
0:12:33,77 --> 0:12:35,597
Yeah, Jeff did do that actually.


211
0:12:35,597 --> 0:12:41,597
- That was before everyone else did.
- You were something of a trendsetter.


212
0:12:41,597 --> 0:12:44,717
So, Valerie, you still at school or what?


213
0:12:44,717 --> 0:12:46,677
She's at college actually.


214
0:12:46,677 --> 0:12:49,757
- Sixth-form college.
- That's the old college.


215
0:12:49,757 --> 0:12:52,637
Right. So what's your favourite subject?


216
0:12:52,637 --> 0:12:56,357
I'm sure Valerie doesn't want
to talk about subjects.


217
0:12:56,357 --> 0:12:58,797
Yeah, sure. So who's best in S-Club?


218
0:12:58,797 --> 0:13:2,957
Oh, erm... I'm not really into them


219
0:13:2,957 --> 0:13:9,477
but I hear they have a big gay following.


220
0:13:9,477 --> 0:13:19,477
'For the worst thing that could possibly
happen this is going extremely well. '


221
0:13:19,477 --> 0:13:24,357
'Maybe I can just really get into Peter
Gabriel and go mental and marry her


222
0:13:24,357 --> 0:13:29,397
'and have lots of sex
and agree with her about everything? '


223
0:13:29,397 --> 0:13:34,157
'I'm bursting! This is why
you should stick to the little cans.


224
0:13:34,157 --> 0:13:36,997
'Ah, the simple pleasures. Oh. '


225
0:13:36,997 --> 0:13:40,357
- You havin' a good night?
- Er, yeah, yeah.


226
0:13:40,357 --> 0:13:42,357
Nice bowling.


227
0:13:42,357 --> 0:13:45,877
You've narrowed it down
to one lane anyway.


228
0:13:45,877 --> 0:13:48,397
Well, you know, it's just a bit of fun.


229
0:13:48,397 --> 0:13:51,837
'Oh, God, I'm never
gonna be able to go now.


230
0:13:51,837 --> 0:13:53,837
'Why can't I go? '


231
0:13:53,837 --> 0:13:55,877
Yeah, just a bit of fun.


232
0:13:55,877 --> 0:13:59,397
After a nice Italian
and a couple of bottles of wine.


233
0:13:59,397 --> 0:14:2,917
- 'Fuck. Italian, wine. '
- Sophie liked it, anyway.


234
0:14:2,917 --> 0:14:6,37
- 'Why didn't I ask her? '
- Loved it, actually.


235
0:14:6,37 --> 0:14:8,37
'Oh... Shit.


236
0:14:8,37 --> 0:14:10,477
'Waterfalls... nothing.


237
0:14:10,477 --> 0:14:12,517
'Pretend you've finished. '


238
0:14:12,517 --> 0:14:17,157
Ahh.


239
0:14:17,157 --> 0:14:21,517
- Any change for the johnny machine?
- What? You...


240
0:14:21,517 --> 0:14:24,997
Actually, I think I'm all right.


241
0:14:24,997 --> 0:14:27,757
I'm thinking a couple of packs of normal.


242
0:14:27,757 --> 0:14:30,37
Knobblies are a bit of a con.


243
0:14:30,37 --> 0:14:33,517
Maybe a couple of fruities for a laugh.


244
0:14:33,517 --> 0:14:37,517
'She hates fruit. Except pears.
If there's pear flavour I'm fucked. '


245
0:14:37,517 --> 0:14:41,797
I can't stop hanging on for you
because I never started.


246
0:14:41,797 --> 0:14:44,237
Well, here's the headlines, buddy!


247
0:14:44,237 --> 0:14:51,437
I can do who I want, when I want,
where I want and I will, OK?!


248
0:14:51,437 --> 0:14:53,757
This is not the rehearsal.


249
0:14:53,757 --> 0:14:57,557
'Come on, clock's ticking,
got to raise my game.


250
0:14:57,557 --> 0:14:59,957
'Think witty. Charming and witty.


251
0:14:59,957 --> 0:15:1,957
'And sexy. '


252
0:15:1,957 --> 0:15:6,797
- Sorry about that. Listen...
- So, fourth pressing, fifth pressing...


253
0:15:6,797 --> 0:15:10,837
What's that all about? Why wait until
everyone else has had their fun...


254
0:15:10,837 --> 0:15:20,517
That is so true.


255
0:15:20,517 --> 0:15:21,957
Mm.


256
0:15:21,957 --> 0:15:25,477
Listen, let's talk more
back at my place, yeah?


257
0:15:25,477 --> 0:15:29,157
'Oh, my God, I knew it.
Olive oil talk. Wicked! '


258
0:15:29,157 --> 0:15:33,237
So, this is nice. Kind of weird but...


259
0:15:33,237 --> 0:15:35,77
Nice, yeah.


260
0:15:35,77 --> 0:15:41,637
Great. So I was just wondering how
you ended up coming out with... Jeff?


261
0:15:41,637 --> 0:15:46,237
Oh, right. Erm, well,
I suppose, well, he asked me.


262
0:15:46,237 --> 0:15:48,277
He asked you. Of course.


263
0:15:48,277 --> 0:15:51,277
- Is that all it takes?
- It certainly helps.


264
0:15:51,277 --> 0:15:54,917
I mean, I did actually ask you myself.


265
0:15:54,917 --> 0:15:59,357
Yes, well, I was already...
and I didn't say anything because...


266
0:15:59,357 --> 0:16:3,197
Well, you know.
So, er, Valerie seems nice.


267
0:16:3,197 --> 0:16:5,237
- She's nothing.
- Oh, right.


268
0:16:5,237 --> 0:16:7,37
'That didn't sound good. '


269
0:16:7,37 --> 0:16:11,557
I mean, it's just a little night out.
I'm a friend of her brother's.


270
0:16:11,557 --> 0:16:14,37
He's a total wanker, actually.


271
0:16:14,37 --> 0:16:17,957
So, have you had a good time
on your... date?


272
0:16:17,957 --> 0:16:20,677
Yeah, you know what you're getting
with Pizza Hut.


273
0:16:20,677 --> 0:16:22,917
'Ha! I win! '


274
0:16:22,917 --> 0:16:24,797
Cool.


275
0:16:24,797 --> 0:16:29,717
So, old seat-sniffer didn't sniff
any of the seats or anything, did he?


276
0:16:29,717 --> 0:16:33,357
That's a rumour that isn't
appropriate for you to...


277
0:16:33,357 --> 0:16:36,37
- Jeff's a nice guy.
- Who should've...


278
0:16:36,37 --> 0:16:38,837
Look, I'm having a nice time.
Leave it, OK?


279
0:16:38,837 --> 0:16:41,237
- You're having a good time.
- Yeah.


280
0:16:41,237 --> 0:16:44,677
Good, because
I'm having a great time too.


281
0:16:44,677 --> 0:16:47,397
That makes two of us
having a great time.


282
0:16:47,397 --> 0:16:52,557
'She's not gonna do it. They won't do it. '


283
0:16:52,557 --> 0:16:57,317
'Wow. Fuck you, lord of death,
I'm still full of piss and vinegar.


284
0:16:57,317 --> 0:16:59,797
'Mm, doing it with a sexy neighbour.


285
0:16:59,797 --> 0:17:4,277
'Ow! That... Why is she sucking it?
Maybe she's practising for my...


286
0:17:4,277 --> 0:17:6,837
'Are you allowed to say when it hurts? '


287
0:17:6,837 --> 0:17:8,957
Whoa, shit!


288
0:17:8,957 --> 0:17:13,917
I divided them into three piles -
yours, mine and don't knows.


289
0:17:13,917 --> 0:17:15,837
Yeah, whatever.


290
0:17:15,837 --> 0:17:17,917
'Maybe this is good?


291
0:17:17,917 --> 0:17:20,837
'Maybe this kind of... turns me on? '


292
0:17:20,837 --> 0:17:25,157
- Then I'll have the Bhundu Boys album.
- Bollocks you are!


293
0:17:25,157 --> 0:17:28,757
- You'd never even heard of them.
- That is such shit.


294
0:17:28,757 --> 0:17:33,77
- Maybe I'II...
- You're not going anywhere.


295
0:17:33,77 --> 0:17:40,677
Boom!


296
0:17:40,677 --> 0:17:44,557
You'll have to do something special
to catch me up, mate.


297
0:17:44,557 --> 0:17:49,237
'Don't let him know he's got to you.
Play it cool. Play it suave. '


298
0:17:49,237 --> 0:17:58,277
Oh, I think I can manage that.


299
0:17:58,277 --> 0:18:2,597
Watch me bowl, Jeff.


300
0:18:2,597 --> 0:18:10,637
I'm bowling, all right?! I'm bowling fruit!


301
0:18:10,637 --> 0:18:22,757
I'm on another level! I've gone beyond!


302
0:18:22,757 --> 0:18:24,757
Fancy a refill?


303
0:18:24,757 --> 0:18:28,837
Er...


304
0:18:28,837 --> 0:18:30,277
OK.


305
0:18:30,277 --> 0:18:33,677
'This is some sort of test.
Like The Great Escape.


306
0:18:33,677 --> 0:18:36,957
'Don't answer in English,
just brave it out. '


307
0:18:36,957 --> 0:18:39,917
Jeremy's a musician.


308
0:18:39,917 --> 0:18:41,517
Uh-huh.


309
0:18:41,517 --> 0:18:43,757
Yeah, I, er, play the keyboard.


310
0:18:43,757 --> 0:18:49,597
You always fancied one of those
keyboards you hold like a guitar.


311
0:18:49,597 --> 0:18:51,637
Used to like a lot of things.


312
0:18:51,637 --> 0:18:55,757
'They're gonna use me for a sex game
and then burn me in the bath. '


313
0:18:55,757 --> 0:19:0,877
Isn't this great, that we can sit
and have a drink together like adults?


314
0:19:0,877 --> 0:19:3,37
Yeah, we're great, aren't we?


315
0:19:3,37 --> 0:19:6,357
Why don't we have a toast?


316
0:19:6,357 --> 0:19:9,557
To us.


317
0:19:9,557 --> 0:19:12,797
- To us.
- To us.


318
0:19:12,797 --> 0:19:17,717
'Oh, come on, someone get the
carving knife and let's get it over with. '


319
0:19:17,717 --> 0:19:22,717
Do you think I like this job?
Do you think I like spending all night


320
0:19:22,717 --> 0:19:27,117
trying to prise shopping
out of our frankly antiquated system?


321
0:19:27,117 --> 0:19:32,117
I'm... sorry. I'm really sorry.
I thought they would just...


322
0:19:32,117 --> 0:19:35,757
I've got your number, mate.
I've got you by the shoes.


323
0:19:35,757 --> 0:19:39,437
He doesn't care about the shoes!


324
0:19:39,437 --> 0:19:42,997
- Fuck your shoes.
- Come on, he's said he's sorry.


325
0:19:42,997 --> 0:19:45,397
What do you know about my shoes?


326
0:19:45,397 --> 0:19:50,397
We're gonna head off, but... I can vouch
for him so could you put it on my card?


327
0:19:50,397 --> 0:19:55,117
Look... Don't go!
Soph, you should stay and bowl.


328
0:19:55,117 --> 0:19:57,157
Bowl the night away, with us.


329
0:19:57,157 --> 0:19:59,197
Er, I don't know...


330
0:19:59,197 --> 0:20:2,757
Once they get the stuff out
we can have a tournament.


331
0:20:2,757 --> 0:20:6,317
I don't think the plastic
can take the strain.


332
0:20:6,317 --> 0:20:10,317
Mark, they're going home to bone, yeah?


333
0:20:10,317 --> 0:20:12,277
Don't screw things up.


334
0:20:12,277 --> 0:20:15,397
- But...
- You have a good night now.


335
0:20:15,397 --> 0:20:16,837
Bye.


336
0:20:16,837 --> 0:20:22,677
'Don't think about it. If you don't
think about it, it won't happen.


337
0:20:22,677 --> 0:20:25,597
'Straight to Frenching. This is so easy.


338
0:20:25,597 --> 0:20:29,157
'I bet Sophie and Jeff
are doing a lot of talking now.


339
0:20:29,157 --> 0:20:33,957
'She can really talk, probably boring him
about the Celestine Prophecy.


340
0:20:33,957 --> 0:20:38,877
'Maybe Jeff's bought loads of booze
so Sophie's too pissed to mind.


341
0:20:38,877 --> 0:20:40,957
'Ow! She's squeezing my...


342
0:20:40,957 --> 0:20:42,877
'Don't complain! '


343
0:20:42,877 --> 0:20:47,637
'Is she going for...? I'm not ready,
there's no action down there. '


344
0:20:47,637 --> 0:20:50,477
Jeremy, are you not...?


345
0:20:50,477 --> 0:20:54,917
Look, are you sure this is OK?
You know, isn't Tony gonna mind?


346
0:20:54,917 --> 0:21:2,797
Tony lost his licence to mind when he
went off with a scrubber called Lindsay!


347
0:21:2,797 --> 0:21:5,557
'She hasn't said anything about my nuts.


348
0:21:5,557 --> 0:21:8,797
'She's too young
to know how weird they are.


349
0:21:8,797 --> 0:21:11,237
'I'm having sex with a teenage girl!


350
0:21:11,237 --> 0:21:14,837
'Sophie wouldn't,
not with the seat-sniffer.


351
0:21:14,837 --> 0:21:18,637
'I mean, we've got a connection.
This is not wrong.


352
0:21:18,637 --> 0:21:21,597
'Just try and memorise it for later.


353
0:21:21,597 --> 0:21:25,877
'Mm, this could be nice,
a nice, lovely neck rub.


354
0:21:25,877 --> 0:21:29,197
'She's strangling me!
She's trying to kill me! '


355
0:21:29,197 --> 0:21:31,477
I... I can't...


356
0:21:31,477 --> 0:21:36,37
I can't...


357
0:21:36,37 --> 0:21:38,677
Jesus, Valerie, w-what?!


358
0:21:38,677 --> 0:21:40,957
Just say if you didn't like it!


359
0:21:40,957 --> 0:21:43,557
- My ex used to love that.
- Well, yeah.


360
0:21:43,557 --> 0:21:46,157
Thanks. Thank you.


361
0:21:46,157 --> 0:21:51,317
It was just the... not breathing. You know.


362
0:21:51,317 --> 0:21:54,77
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God.


363
0:21:54,77 --> 0:21:57,837
You can be as loud as you like!


364
0:21:57,837 --> 0:21:59,477
Oh, God.


365
0:21:59,477 --> 0:22:2,677
Oh, God, this is great!


366
0:22:2,677 --> 0:22:5,997
I'm having great sex!


367
0:22:5,997 --> 0:22:8,557
- Oh! Oh!
- Yeah, yeah.


368
0:22:8,557 --> 0:22:11,477
Couldn't we... close... the door?


369
0:22:11,477 --> 0:22:14,557
The idea of getting caught turns me on!


370
0:22:14,557 --> 0:22:17,277
But we've already been caught.


371
0:22:17,277 --> 0:22:20,717
- The cappuccino machine?
- You're never!


372
0:22:20,717 --> 0:22:23,677
Taking! The Gaggia!


373
0:22:23,677 --> 0:22:27,717
Thanks for letting me stay.
My sister's in my room and...


374
0:22:27,717 --> 0:22:30,517
No problem, I'll be fine on the sofa.


375
0:22:30,517 --> 0:22:35,197
Have you got everything you need?
Do you want the hall light left on?


376
0:22:35,197 --> 0:22:39,357
- Mark...
- No, right, sure. Of course.


377
0:22:39,357 --> 0:22:42,317
'She does look kind of great
in my pyjamas.


378
0:22:42,317 --> 0:22:44,517
'That's sick. Why is that sick? '


379
0:22:44,517 --> 0:22:46,757
Valerie, I-I was thinking...


380
0:22:46,757 --> 0:22:50,517
Oh, God, Jeremy, this is the best!


381
0:22:50,517 --> 0:22:54,197
Best ever!


382
0:22:54,197 --> 0:22:57,277
Yeah, so I was... The sofa, it's a bit...


383
0:22:57,277 --> 0:24:57,277
You are the daddy!
