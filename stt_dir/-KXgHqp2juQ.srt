1
0:0:2,33 --> 0:0:6,7
The killing of Osama Bin Laden is a failure to me


2
0:0:6,7 --> 0:0:11,9
because the negative retroactions of that will be enormous!


3
0:0:11,9 --> 0:0:13,22
It's the amount of hatred and people


4
0:0:13,22 --> 0:0:16,14
that will die as a result of that.


5
0:0:16,14 --> 0:0:20,58
So the killing of one man never destroys a value system.


6
0:0:20,58 --> 0:0:24,85
It destroys that person, but the value system goes on.


7
0:0:24,85 --> 0:0:28,13
Racism, bigotry, stupidity


8
0:0:28,13 --> 0:0:31,68
are part of the problem. Stupidity means


9
0:0:31,68 --> 0:0:35,57
lack of information regarding certain types of problems.


10
0:0:35,57 --> 0:0:38,73
When you read in a book that revenge is sweet,


11
0:0:38,73 --> 0:0:43,48
and if that takes as a system, it hurts people.


12
0:0:43,48 --> 0:0:47,35
Therefore, all that type of literature has to go.


13
0:0:47,35 --> 0:0:50,43
To the extent that we raise our children


14
0:0:50,43 --> 0:0:55,9
with artificial values, that will produce harm in the future.


15
0:0:55,9 --> 0:0:57,56
You think, "Well they're only children.


16
0:0:57,56 --> 0:1:0,21
I don't think it's that necessary."


17
0:1:0,21 --> 0:1:5,48
Well, war, guns, possession of guns


18
0:1:5,48 --> 0:1:8,83
are partly nurtured by our culture.


19
0:1:8,83 --> 0:1:13,6
And guns give people a sense of power,


20
0:1:13,6 --> 0:1:17,16
a false sense of power. Real sense of power


21
0:1:17,16 --> 0:1:21,29
is delivery of information that's relevant to people.


22
0:1:21,29 --> 0:1:23,8
Of course you don't sense it right away.


23
0:1:23,8 --> 0:1:27,12
You don't feel a glorious feeling doing that.


24
0:1:27,12 --> 0:1:30,86
But really, it's a long term investment.


25
0:1:30,86 --> 0:1:35,6
And all short term investments may appear to solve problems,


26
0:1:35,6 --> 0:1:40,29
but they only perpetuate problems into the future.


27
0:1:40,29 --> 0:1:44,18
A major problem with the world's people today,


28
0:1:44,18 --> 0:1:48,12
is they believe that human values and behavior


29
0:1:48,12 --> 0:1:53,8
and decisions are made within a human being.


30
0:1:53,8 --> 0:1:55,57
Actually this is not the case.


31
0:1:55,57 --> 0:2:0,14
That's a major cause of most the world's problems.


32
0:2:0,14 --> 0:2:2,93
It is the environment they are reared in.


33
0:2:2,93 --> 0:2:7,77
If you cannot understand that, think of the language you use


34
0:2:7,77 --> 0:2:13,3
and the values you have and the attitudes about a 'good old USA'.


35
0:2:13,3 --> 0:2:15,67
If you were brought up in Iran, your value system


36
0:2:15,67 --> 0:2:19,7
would be different. Your language would be different.


37
0:2:19,7 --> 0:2:24,2
Therefore, it is not within the human being to know the difference


38
0:2:24,2 --> 0:2:27,57
between what you would call operant behavior


39
0:2:27,57 --> 0:2:30,9
or useful behavior or useful values.


40
0:2:30,9 --> 0:2:36,26
All your values are inculcated by environment: the books you read,


41
0:2:36,26 --> 0:2:39,92
the motion pictures you see, the role models you have.


42
0:2:39,92 --> 0:2:44,9
Therefore, human beings are not, I repeat this,


43
0:2:44,9 --> 0:2:47,53
are not responsible for their values.


44
0:2:47,53 --> 0:2:49,53
They are learned.


45
0:2:49,53 --> 0:2:52,11
And if you don't understand that,


46
0:2:52,11 --> 0:2:54,97
you should become more familiar with the effects


47
0:2:54,97 --> 0:2:58,23
of environment on human behavior.


48
0:2:58,23 --> 0:3:2,91
The very fact that they used to burn witches in Salem, Massachusetts,


49
0:3:2,91 --> 0:3:6,1
might mean that within that area,


50
0:3:6,1 --> 0:3:9,66
most people were brought up with such a value system.


51
0:3:9,66 --> 0:3:14,41
The notions of heaven and hell come from books and other people.


52
0:3:14,41 --> 0:3:17,54
Your language comes from your environment.


53
0:3:17,54 --> 0:3:21,65
Possibly the difference between a Roman and a Greek


54
0:3:21,65 --> 0:3:24,16
would be the environment they are reared in.


55
0:3:24,16 --> 0:3:26,49
If you don't understand that,


56
0:3:26,49 --> 0:3:29,81
you need a lot of education, a lot of information,


57
0:3:29,81 --> 0:3:32,19
and you'll have to seek it.


58
0:3:32,19 --> 0:3:37,24
We have to seek information that's relevant to people,


59
0:3:37,24 --> 0:3:40,58
not information based upon opinions, folkways,


60
0:3:40,58 --> 0:3:45,62
hand-down values or feelings of 'good' and 'bad'.


61
0:3:45,62 --> 0:3:50,29
All those feelings of good, bad, right and wrong are all learned.


62
0:3:50,29 --> 0:3:52,22
Everything is learned.


63
0:3:52,22 --> 0:3:54,93
If you still don't understand that


64
0:3:54,93 --> 0:3:59,3
look back at the words you use, and you'll find


65
0:3:59,3 --> 0:4:2,38
that they're words that you've picked up from your environment.


66
0:4:2,38 --> 0:4:5,27
An Englishman speaks with an English accent,


67
0:4:5,27 --> 0:4:8,7
not because he's English, but because he's been exposed


68
0:4:8,7 --> 0:4:12,34
to that environment and those sounds of words.


69
0:4:12,34 --> 0:4:15,21
An Australian speaks like an Australian


70
0:4:15,21 --> 0:4:20,5
because he's brought up in an environment that utilizes that dialog.


71
0:4:20,5 --> 0:4:24,99
A southerner speaks different than a northerner.


72
0:4:24,99 --> 0:4:29,63
And if you still don't understand that, that's the best I can do.


73
0:4:29,63 --> 0:4:32,12
We reflect our culture.


74
0:4:32,12 --> 0:4:35,7
Osama Bin Laden is dead.


75
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:39,67
But the value system that produced him is not.


76
0:4:39,67 --> 0:4:42,49
It is quite alive.


77
0:4:42,49 --> 0:4:46,14
That goes for the Nazis,


78
0:4:46,14 --> 0:4:50,35
the Klu Klux Klan, the White Citizens Council.


79
0:4:50,35 --> 0:4:53,38
The value system is still alive.


80
0:4:53,38 --> 0:4:56,63
What is needed is not assassinations,


81
0:4:56,63 --> 0:4:59,41
not murder, not killing.


82
0:4:59,41 --> 0:5:3,36
No armies or navies to solve problems.


83
0:5:3,36 --> 0:5:7,83
What is really needed is a change in our values.


84
0:5:7,83 --> 0:5:10,71
I believe in the Bible you'll find


85
0:5:10,71 --> 0:5:14,45
a section where Jesus Christ mentions,


86
0:5:14,45 --> 0:5:17,4
"He who is without sin,


87
0:5:17,4 --> 0:5:20,59
let him cast the first stone."


88
0:5:20,59 --> 0:5:24,44
I don't know what the word 'sin' means, but I do know this.


89
0:5:24,44 --> 0:5:27,49
Erroneous values can cause


90
0:5:27,49 --> 0:5:32,43
unbelievable suffering amongst people.


91
0:5:32,43 --> 0:5:35,79
And we, our nation, like other nations


92
0:5:35,79 --> 0:5:40,93
are mainly like children, that do not have answers,


93
0:5:40,93 --> 0:5:44,22
that do not have solutions to problems.


94
0:5:44,22 --> 0:5:47,31
Whereby, many solutions are violent


95
0:5:47,31 --> 0:5:49,62
and they do not solve problems.


96
0:5:49,62 --> 0:5:54,63
What is really needed is a change in values,


97
0:5:54,63 --> 0:5:59,8
not the election of this governor or that governor.


98
0:5:59,8 --> 0:6:2,9
There's no change in values in that.


99
0:6:2,9 --> 0:6:6,23
By change in values I mean living in accordance with


100
0:6:6,23 --> 0:6:8,71
the natural capacity,


101
0:6:8,71 --> 0:6:11,9
that is, the carrying capacity of the earth.


102
0:6:11,9 --> 0:6:16,39
And if we violate that, there are all kinds of problems.


103
0:6:16,39 --> 0:6:19,74
When you violate the laws of nature,


104
0:6:19,74 --> 0:6:22,5
which are really inviolable,


105
0:6:22,5 --> 0:6:25,6
they will produce other negative effects.


106
0:6:25,6 --> 0:6:29,82
We don't study what the negative retroaction will be


107
0:6:29,82 --> 0:6:33,39
on the assassination of Osama Bin Laden,


108
0:6:33,39 --> 0:6:37,96
but we're building a catalog of problems up ahead.


109
0:6:37,96 --> 0:6:41,85
I think that the solution to problems take longer.


110
0:6:41,85 --> 0:6:45,99
Of course, a sane solution takes many years.


111
0:6:45,99 --> 0:6:50,1
And that is, to arrive at a value system


112
0:6:50,1 --> 0:6:52,68
that supports nature, the earth


113
0:6:52,68 --> 0:6:56,0
and all the people that live on this earth.


114
0:6:56,0 --> 0:6:58,86
If they all go off in different directions


115
0:6:58,86 --> 0:7:1,54
and evolve different value systems,


116
0:7:1,54 --> 0:7:3,64
there's got to be trouble,


117
0:7:3,64 --> 0:7:7,14
and you cannot solve problems by killing people.


118
0:7:7,14 --> 0:7:11,26
Although most of you believe that 'revenge is sweet'.


119
0:7:11,26 --> 0:7:16,43
It is only sweet to the naive and childlike attitudes


120
0:7:16,43 --> 0:7:20,82
whereby we feel good when we get rid of a certain person


121
0:7:20,82 --> 0:7:23,11
identified with the problem.


122
0:7:23,11 --> 0:7:26,6
That does not solve the problem.


123
0:7:26,6 --> 0:7:28,79
If you yourselves as Americans,


124
0:7:28,79 --> 0:7:33,8
were brought up in that country where those values are dominant,


125
0:7:33,8 --> 0:7:35,41
you will support those values.


126
0:7:35,41 --> 0:7:38,52
It isn't killing people that solves problems.


127
0:7:38,52 --> 0:7:42,23
It's outgrowing values that no longer work,


128
0:7:42,23 --> 0:7:45,33
and this is what we have to identify.


129
0:7:45,33 --> 0:7:49,7
If you cannot identify the values that do not work,


130
0:7:49,7 --> 0:7:51,93
you cannot undo them.


131
0:7:51,93 --> 0:7:57,17
Only through education can we change human values.


132
0:7:57,17 --> 0:8:0,79
And what we have to do is approach nations


133
0:8:0,79 --> 0:8:4,78
and share with them some of our values, if we can.


134
0:8:4,78 --> 0:8:7,77
And if you don't know how to do that, you have to find


135
0:8:7,77 --> 0:8:9,95
the means for doing that.


136
0:8:9,95 --> 0:8:14,11
It is absolutely essential that we find the means


137
0:8:14,11 --> 0:8:17,95
for bridging the difference between nations.


138
0:8:17,95 --> 0:8:20,87
And the nearest thing that I know of


139
0:8:20,87 --> 0:8:23,58
that can solve those problems


140
0:8:23,58 --> 0:8:27,79
is to arrive at decisions, rather than make them.


141
0:8:27,79 --> 0:8:30,16
Arriving at decisions meaning


142
0:8:30,16 --> 0:8:34,33
put all your decisions to test, see if they work.


143
0:8:34,33 --> 0:8:37,63
Use scientific scales of performance.


144
0:8:37,63 --> 0:8:41,39
And in that manner, we can probably arrive at


145
0:8:41,39 --> 0:8:44,47
closer agreements with nations.


146
0:8:44,47 --> 0:8:48,8
I believe that all nations need the same thing :


147
0:8:48,8 --> 0:8:53,41
clean air, clean water, arable land,


148
0:8:53,41 --> 0:8:56,45
and medical and health security,


149
0:8:56,45 --> 0:9:0,58
and access to food and the necessities of life.


150
0:9:0,58 --> 0:9:4,3
If we fail to work together,


151
0:9:4,3 --> 0:9:6,82
attempting to solve these problems,


152
0:9:6,82 --> 0:9:9,87
I feel the problems will continue


153
0:9:9,87 --> 0:9:12,67
in much more vicious ways,


154
0:9:12,67 --> 0:9:16,56
because we are not touching, or not addressing


155
0:9:16,56 --> 0:9:19,63
the actual manifestation


156
0:9:19,63 --> 0:9:23,4
of how these values come into being.


157
0:9:23,4 --> 0:9:27,92
And it's only through careful study, not feelings of revenge,


158
0:9:27,92 --> 0:9:30,91
careful study, that will enable people


159
0:9:30,91 --> 0:9:35,75
to outgrow systems that are no longer relevant.


160
0:9:35,75 --> 0:9:38,64
What is needed is a value system


161
0:9:38,64 --> 0:9:43,87
that coincides with the nature of human need.


162
0:9:43,87 --> 0:9:47,38
Now not only that, but humans are part of the environment.


163
0:9:47,38 --> 0:9:50,97
Therefore, the environment is part of human needs,


164
0:9:50,97 --> 0:9:53,48
whether we recognize it or not.


165
0:9:53,48 --> 0:9:57,66
Another part of human need is the differences in values.


166
0:9:57,66 --> 0:10:1,0
If people all have multiplicity of values


167
0:10:1,0 --> 0:10:4,92
that differ from one another, there will be conflict.


168
0:10:4,92 --> 0:10:9,56
How do we go about selecting a value system that makes sense?


169
0:10:9,56 --> 0:10:13,81
And how do we go about presenting a value system


170
0:10:13,81 --> 0:10:17,98
to people who know nothing about such a value system?


171
0:10:17,98 --> 0:10:20,47
I think the best way to do it


172
0:10:20,47 --> 0:10:23,71
is demonstration with films.


173
0:10:23,71 --> 0:10:29,1
In films, we can show how a person feels a volcano is angry.


174
0:10:29,1 --> 0:10:31,22
We have to show those movies


175
0:10:31,22 --> 0:10:36,8
and the sincerity of the witchdoctor talking about the solution.


176
0:10:36,8 --> 0:10:39,43
And we have to show the sincerity of Romans


177
0:10:39,43 --> 0:10:41,97
feeding Christians to lions.


178
0:10:41,97 --> 0:10:47,25
And we have to point out a group of people stoning a woman.


179
0:10:47,25 --> 0:10:49,46
And when Jesus comes in, he says:


180
0:10:49,46 --> 0:10:53,42
"He who is without sin, let him cast the first stone."


181
0:10:53,42 --> 0:10:57,38
All of us are erroneous in our values


182
0:10:57,38 --> 0:11:1,4
due to the early part of our historical upbringing.


183
0:11:1,4 --> 0:11:5,19
We are given a set of values that do not work.


184
0:11:5,19 --> 0:11:8,24
Proof: We have war, recession,


185
0:11:8,24 --> 0:11:12,28
hunger, poverty, starvation, illness.


186
0:11:12,28 --> 0:11:15,32
And if our society were oriented


187
0:11:15,32 --> 0:11:19,39
toward the well-being of our fellow human beings,


188
0:11:19,39 --> 0:11:24,22
I cannot see these problems as being dominant,


189
0:11:24,22 --> 0:11:28,32
in a society where every man works for himself,


190
0:11:28,32 --> 0:11:33,11
individual incentive, working for one's self.


191
0:11:33,11 --> 0:11:35,72
If people worked for one's self',


192
0:11:35,72 --> 0:11:38,13
there wouldn't be the electric light.


193
0:11:38,13 --> 0:11:42,15
There wouldn't be engines and powered vehicles.


194
0:11:42,15 --> 0:11:44,86
There wouldn't be electrification,


195
0:11:44,86 --> 0:11:47,77
and reservoirs and water purification.


196
0:11:47,77 --> 0:11:50,92
These are processes that help all people.


197
0:11:50,92 --> 0:11:53,8
And processes that help single people


198
0:11:53,8 --> 0:11:58,23
is a very primitive value system carried into this century


199
0:11:58,23 --> 0:12:0,72
which is really not necessary.


200
0:12:0,72 --> 0:12:4,16
However, it appears that humans


201
0:12:4,16 --> 0:12:8,37
do not seem to change or improve their value system


202
0:12:8,37 --> 0:12:12,55
until there is utter failure of that value system.


203
0:12:12,55 --> 0:12:15,63
People trained as a scientist tend to pause


204
0:12:15,63 --> 0:12:19,3
a little bit, before they accept an idea,


205
0:12:19,3 --> 0:12:23,3
a little more than the average person.


206
0:12:23,3 --> 0:12:26,91
They try to evaluate and they figured: "Well, a man is using


207
0:12:26,91 --> 0:12:31,88
the scientific method. He probably draws the correct conclusions."


208
0:12:31,88 --> 0:12:35,76
You know when you have faith in somebody, believe in somebody.


209
0:12:35,76 --> 0:12:38,9
A scientist doesn't believe in anything,


210
0:12:38,9 --> 0:12:42,77
neither accepts, rejects or holds in abeyance;


211
0:12:42,77 --> 0:12:45,17
that is, does not make a judgment


212
0:12:45,17 --> 0:12:52,5
until verifiable evidence is produced.


213
0:12:52,5 --> 0:12:56,4
So killing people is not the solution to any problem


214
0:12:56,4 --> 0:13:6,2
at all. War is the maximum expression of ignorance.


215
0:13:6,2 --> 0:13:9,83
'Good' and 'bad' is part of a value system.


216
0:13:9,83 --> 0:13:12,8
It has nothing to do with something coming


217
0:13:12,8 --> 0:13:15,68
from the inside of a human being.


218
0:13:15,68 --> 0:13:21,54
It appears that all evidence shows that intuition does not,


219
0:13:21,54 --> 0:13:25,59
and is not based upon innermost feelings.


220
0:13:25,59 --> 0:13:30,28
It's not based upon evidence. It's based upon


221
0:13:30,28 --> 0:13:34,6
being exposed to erroneous value systems.


222
0:13:34,6 --> 0:13:37,4
And where do you start most values?


223
0:13:37,4 --> 0:13:41,21
Most human values are erroneous,


224
0:13:41,21 --> 0:13:45,29
except when it comes to mathematics, physics, chemistry.


225
0:13:45,29 --> 0:13:47,74
They are more appropriate.


226
0:13:47,74 --> 0:13:52,32
So I would say if you become familiar with particular books,


227
0:13:52,32 --> 0:15:52,32
literature that we have on our website, it may help you.
