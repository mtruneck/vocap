-One of the lingering problems
we still have to address is


3
0:0:12,52 --> 0:0:14,25
sewage pollution.


4
0:0:14,25 --> 0:0:16,21
EMERSON ROSENTHAL: A sewer right
outside of Gainesville,


5
0:0:16,21 --> 0:0:18,53
and this house right
here has a huge


6
0:0:18,53 --> 0:0:20,88
fucking hole in its backyard.


7
0:0:20,88 --> 0:0:22,97
-It's the North versus
the South.


8
0:0:22,97 --> 0:0:25,41
It's the war of water in
California's been going on


9
0:0:25,41 --> 0:0:26,91
since the gold rush.


10
0:0:26,91 --> 0:0:29,6
And it's continuing
to this day.


11
0:0:29,6 --> 0:0:31,69
-It's always been somebody
trying to steal our water.


12
0:0:31,69 --> 0:0:32,72
Don't take my water.


13
0:0:32,72 --> 0:0:34,99
I depend on it for
my livelihood.


14
0:0:34,99 --> 0:0:37,21
-In our opinion, although we
haven't figured out a way,


15
0:0:37,21 --> 0:0:38,14
there are people that
should be put in


16
0:0:38,14 --> 0:0:39,86
jail for these things.
