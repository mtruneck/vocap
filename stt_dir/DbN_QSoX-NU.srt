1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,81



2
0:0:4,81 --> 0:0:6,93
HARRY CHEADLE: When I said I
wanted to be in a band, this


3
0:0:6,93 --> 0:0:10,17
wasn't what I had in mind.


4
0:0:10,17 --> 0:0:13,46
I pictured guitar solos and
moshing, not waving around a


5
0:0:13,46 --> 0:0:14,37
buzzing wand.


6
0:0:14,37 --> 0:0:17,44
I'm a big fan of the rock and
roll lifestyle, and loud angry


7
0:0:17,44 --> 0:0:18,61
music in general.


8
0:0:18,61 --> 0:0:20,665
But my problem was I didn't
know how to play an


9
0:0:20,665 --> 0:0:22,7
instrument.


10
0:0:22,7 --> 0:0:25,1
So like a lot of ultra amateur
musicians, I turned to the


11
0:0:25,1 --> 0:0:27,8
avant garde electronica scene
and called Wadih, my friend


12
0:0:27,8 --> 0:0:30,69
from art school, and asked if I
could join his experimental


13
0:0:30,69 --> 0:0:32,83
band, US TM.


14
0:0:32,83 --> 0:0:36,79
He said yes, and that's how
I became a wandist.


15
0:0:36,79 --> 0:0:38,33
My name is Harry, and
I've been a loser


16
0:0:38,33 --> 0:0:39,67
for most of my life.


17
0:0:39,67 --> 0:0:41,91
I thought I was done with my
awkward phase when Vice hired


18
0:0:41,91 --> 0:0:44,55
me to write about politics,
culture, and other important


19
0:0:44,55 --> 0:0:46,83
world affairs, which should
make me cool.


20
0:0:46,83 --> 0:0:48,4
But it doesn't.


21
0:0:48,4 --> 0:0:50,35
I'm still just a weird kid
who creeps people out.


22
0:0:50,35 --> 0:0:52,135
This is All Around Losing
with Harry Cheadle.


23
0:0:52,135 --> 0:0:55,18



24
0:0:55,18 --> 0:0:55,73
[INAUDIBLE]


25
0:0:55,73 --> 0:0:57,87
invited me to his studio to
practice with the other


26
0:0:57,87 --> 0:1:1,117
members of his band, Brian and
Genevieve before we performed.


27
0:1:1,117 --> 0:1:2,31
[RINGING]


28
0:1:2,31 --> 0:1:3,43
Hey, it's Harry.


29
0:1:3,43 --> 0:1:5,266
I'm here to be in the band.


30
0:1:5,266 --> 0:1:13,6
[BUZZER]


31
0:1:13,6 --> 0:1:16,615
It smells a lot like
marijuana.


32
0:1:16,615 --> 0:1:19,65
I don't know how
to get in here.


33
0:1:19,65 --> 0:1:20,65
BRIAN CARROLL: Who is it?


34
0:1:20,65 --> 0:1:22,65
HARRY CHEADLE: Hey,
it's Harry.


35
0:1:22,65 --> 0:1:23,9
It's Harry.


36
0:1:23,9 --> 0:1:27,87



37
0:1:27,87 --> 0:1:30,53
When I got inside, there was
an art school style dance


38
0:1:30,53 --> 0:1:33,83
party going on that
was really sexy.


39
0:1:33,83 --> 0:1:36,73
I remember this kind of party
from back in college.


40
0:1:36,73 --> 0:1:38,77
I dusted off my old
dance moves--


41
0:1:38,77 --> 0:1:41,22
namely the dance move where I
feel really uncomfortable in


42
0:1:41,22 --> 0:1:44,5
my body and stand around hoping
that nobody notices me,


43
0:1:44,5 --> 0:1:45,3
or what I'm doing.


44
0:1:45,3 --> 0:1:49,78



45
0:1:49,78 --> 0:1:51,6
Finally it was time to
play with the band.


46
0:1:51,6 --> 0:1:52,85
So I walked back
to the studio.


47
0:1:52,85 --> 0:2:2,43



48
0:2:2,43 --> 0:2:5,74
Before we began, Genevieve had
to smear some junk on me.


49
0:2:5,74 --> 0:2:6,973
It was spiritual.


50
0:2:6,973 --> 0:2:9,438
What is this you're putting
on my face?


51
0:2:9,438 --> 0:2:10,917
GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: This is
going to to help open up


52
0:2:10,917 --> 0:2:16,833
everything from your yoni
up to your [INAUDIBLE]


53
0:2:16,833 --> 0:2:18,312
chakra here.


54
0:2:18,312 --> 0:2:20,284
It looks really good on you.


55
0:2:20,284 --> 0:2:20,777
HARRY CHEADLE: Thank you.


56
0:2:20,777 --> 0:2:22,749
I can't see it.


57
0:2:22,749 --> 0:2:23,735
GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: Today
we're going to


58
0:2:23,735 --> 0:2:25,214
teach you the wand.


59
0:2:25,214 --> 0:2:29,158
So just think of that like a
masculine creative force.


60
0:2:29,158 --> 0:2:31,623
[INAUDIBLE]


61
0:2:31,623 --> 0:2:34,581
You can also play
with stopping.


62
0:2:34,581 --> 0:2:35,567
HARRY CHEADLE: Oh.


63
0:2:35,567 --> 0:2:38,6
It's nice you get
a breeze, too.


64
0:2:38,6 --> 0:2:39,21
It's a great way to cool off.


65
0:2:39,21 --> 0:2:39,642
GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU:
It is nice.


66
0:2:39,642 --> 0:2:40,94
HARRY CHEADLE: And
an instrument.


67
0:2:40,94 --> 0:2:44,49
Since they're musicians, Wadih
and his crew can be as weird


68
0:2:44,49 --> 0:2:45,42
as they want.


69
0:2:45,42 --> 0:2:47,48
They can dress like David
Bowie dancers.


70
0:2:47,48 --> 0:2:49,87
They can glue symbolic stickers
onto your face.


71
0:2:49,87 --> 0:2:51,67
They can even spray you
with rose water


72
0:2:51,67 --> 0:2:53,2
containing moth poop.


73
0:2:53,2 --> 0:2:55,49
So when they hand you a buzzing
child's toy and tell


74
0:2:55,49 --> 0:2:57,62
you to dance with it, you
dance with it, no


75
0:2:57,62 --> 0:2:58,87
matter who's watching.


76
0:2:58,87 --> 0:3:5,67



77
0:3:5,67 --> 0:3:8,18
US TM turned out to be
really popular band.


78
0:3:8,18 --> 0:3:10,42
I felt like I was cooler and
more important than the people


79
0:3:10,42 --> 0:3:13,0
watching me, which I think
is what being in a band


80
0:3:13,0 --> 0:3:14,25
is really all about.


81
0:3:14,25 --> 0:3:18,106



82
0:3:18,106 --> 0:3:19,2
[INAUDIBLE]


83
0:3:19,2 --> 0:3:20,4
fit in with the band.


84
0:3:20,4 --> 0:3:21,25
I want to have the look.


85
0:3:21,25 --> 0:3:23,21
I was wondering if you could
take me shopping.


86
0:3:23,21 --> 0:3:24,58
GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: The whole
look that we're working on


87
0:3:24,58 --> 0:3:26,89
right now is retard
Renaissance.


88
0:3:26,89 --> 0:3:27,93
HARRY CHEADLE: Maybe we could
go to a thrift store and you


89
0:3:27,93 --> 0:3:29,77
could make me into a
Renaissance retard?


90
0:3:29,77 --> 0:3:31,166
GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: Yes,
I would love to do that.


91
0:3:31,166 --> 0:3:37,52



92
0:3:37,52 --> 0:3:39,96
HARRY CHEADLE: So you're going
to make me look as beautiful


93
0:3:39,96 --> 0:3:40,42
as you guys?


94
0:3:40,42 --> 0:3:41,18
GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: Yeah.


95
0:3:41,18 --> 0:3:42,4
We can help you.


96
0:3:42,4 --> 0:3:44,19
We just want you to
find your inner--


97
0:3:44,19 --> 0:3:44,67
HARRY CHEADLE: Retard?


98
0:3:44,67 --> 0:3:48,14
GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: By retard
we mean your inner child, your


99
0:3:48,14 --> 0:3:50,66
creative unabashed creativity.


100
0:3:50,66 --> 0:3:52,62
HARRY CHEADLE: I want to
look like I get laid.


101
0:3:52,62 --> 0:3:53,9
GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: Let's
think chain mail.


102
0:3:53,9 --> 0:3:55,16
Let's think--


103
0:3:55,16 --> 0:3:56,41
HARRY CHEADLE: Like
that thing?


104
0:3:56,41 --> 0:4:0,44



105
0:4:0,44 --> 0:4:2,646
WADIH SADER: Are these
worn by man?


106
0:4:2,646 --> 0:4:3,896
GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU:
I don't know.


107
0:4:3,896 --> 0:4:14,85



108
0:4:14,85 --> 0:4:15,64
Cool.


109
0:4:15,64 --> 0:4:16,959
HARRY CHEADLE: I feel like I
looks like a cafeteria worker


110
0:4:16,959 --> 0:4:18,1
with this cap.


111
0:4:18,1 --> 0:4:21,41
GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: Yeah,
it's a little lunch lady.


112
0:4:21,41 --> 0:4:26,22
HARRY CHEADLE: Like a lunch
lady for a DD and SM club.


113
0:4:26,22 --> 0:4:27,87
So thanks for all
your help guys.


114
0:4:27,87 --> 0:4:29,93
I think I got it sorted out.


115
0:4:29,93 --> 0:4:30,395
GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU:
I'm excited to


116
0:4:30,395 --> 0:4:31,82
see what you choose.


117
0:4:31,82 --> 0:4:34,705
It's going to be a
transformation.


118
0:4:34,705 --> 0:4:40,5
[PURRING]


119
0:4:40,5 --> 0:4:41,8
HARRY CHEADLE: Would I be able
to pull off the retard


120
0:4:41,8 --> 0:4:42,81
Renaissance look?


121
0:4:42,81 --> 0:4:45,9
Was I weird enough to be
in a band like this?


122
0:4:45,9 --> 0:4:45,93
Probably not.


123
0:4:45,93 --> 0:4:48,23
But I was going to give it a
shot later that night at a


124
0:4:48,23 --> 0:4:51,84
poetry reading slash performance
art thing that


125
0:4:51,84 --> 0:4:53,49
young people with the
beards and the


126
0:4:53,49 --> 0:4:55,0
jewelery like to go to.


127
0:4:55,0 --> 0:4:59,7



128
0:4:59,7 --> 0:5:1,84
We just drank a pint of whisky
in the loading dock.


129
0:5:1,84 --> 0:5:4,52
So that's pretty
rock and roll.


130
0:5:4,52 --> 0:5:6,57
I got one more thing to
wear, and I'm going to


131
0:5:6,57 --> 0:5:7,82
join them in there.


132
0:5:7,82 --> 0:5:21,91



133
0:5:21,91 --> 0:5:23,98
Was this all an elaborate
practical joke?


134
0:5:23,98 --> 0:5:25,73
Why did I have to put all
the stuff in my mouth?


135
0:5:25,73 --> 0:5:27,98
GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: And roll
your eyes up to the ceiling.


136
0:5:27,98 --> 0:5:46,6



137
0:5:46,6 --> 0:5:48,22
HARRY CHEADLE: Whisky
chain mail or not, I


138
0:5:48,22 --> 0:5:49,43
wasn't feeling confident.


139
0:5:49,43 --> 0:5:51,97
Part of the wand had broken, and
I wasn't sure it actually


140
0:5:51,97 --> 0:5:53,22
made noise.


141
0:5:53,22 --> 0:5:55,72



142
0:5:55,72 --> 0:5:58,36
The audience seemed to be taking
this really seriously.


143
0:5:58,36 --> 0:5:59,78
Or maybe they were
in on the joke.


144
0:5:59,78 --> 0:6:2,51
So I tried to keep a straight
face while waving the wand.


145
0:6:2,51 --> 0:6:14,25



146
0:6:14,25 --> 0:6:16,88
At this point, when Genevieve
started sort of writhing on


147
0:6:16,88 --> 0:6:19,4
the floor in her sparkly
see-through outfit, and I ran


148
0:6:19,4 --> 0:6:22,28
the wand over her, it felt like
a combination of a little


149
0:6:22,28 --> 0:6:24,75
kid playing doctor, and
performance art.


150
0:6:24,75 --> 0:6:26,0
But sexier.


151
0:6:26,0 --> 0:6:28,938



152
0:6:28,938 --> 0:6:31,38
[APPLAUSE]


153
0:6:31,38 --> 0:6:32,8
HARRY CHEADLE: And
then it was over.


154
0:6:32,8 --> 0:6:34,79
It wasn't exactly a
Springsteen show.


155
0:6:34,79 --> 0:6:36,84
But no-one was laughing
or making fun of us.


156
0:6:36,84 --> 0:6:39,11
So I guess it went
pretty well.


157
0:6:39,11 --> 0:6:40,73
I learned a lot from
performing.


158
0:6:40,73 --> 0:6:42,27
That you don't actually
need to play an


159
0:6:42,27 --> 0:6:44,0
instrument to be in a band.


160
0:6:44,0 --> 0:6:44,91
That should've been obvious.


161
0:6:44,91 --> 0:6:46,6
You just need to wave
something in


162
0:6:46,6 --> 0:6:47,22
front of your face.


163
0:6:47,22 --> 0:6:48,64
It doesn't really matter what
you're doing as long


164
0:6:48,64 --> 0:6:49,46
as you're on stage.


165
0:6:49,46 --> 0:6:51,49
That's the most important
thing, just be on stage.


166
0:6:51,49 --> 0:6:52,44
And also dress weird.


167
0:6:52,44 --> 0:6:53,89
Dress in chain mail.


168
0:6:53,89 --> 0:6:54,97
TATIANA: I thought that
was really cool.


169
0:6:54,97 --> 0:6:56,57
It was also really sexy.


170
0:6:56,57 --> 0:6:58,35
HARRY CHEADLE: Oh, yeah?


171
0:6:58,35 --> 0:6:59,75
What part was the sexiest
part of it.


172
0:6:59,75 --> 0:7:1,95
TATIANA: Just like
the undulating


173
0:7:1,95 --> 0:7:3,93
base and the wah-wah.


174
0:7:3,93 --> 0:7:5,58
HARRY CHEADLE: No one had
ever called me sexy


175
0:7:5,58 --> 0:7:6,81
or undulating before.


176
0:7:6,81 --> 0:7:8,53
So that was a big step.


177
0:7:8,53 --> 0:7:10,91
Who needs years of practice or
training in an instrument?


178
0:7:10,91 --> 0:7:13,82
It turns out all you need to be
successful as a musician is


179
0:7:13,82 --> 0:7:15,25
a sparkly wand.


180
0:7:15,25 --> 0:7:17,35
I felt really empowered
afterwards, and part of a


181
0:7:17,35 --> 0:7:19,18
scene, just like Yoko Ono.


182
0:7:19,18 --> 0:7:23,95
I was finally a cool band music
playing guy, just like I


183
0:7:23,95 --> 0:7:25,2
always wanted.


184
0:7:25,2 --> 0:7:27,6



185
0:7:27,6 --> 0:7:30,3
So, I told them, keep
your chain mail on.


186
0:7:30,3 --> 0:7:31,37
That's a stupid tagline.


187
0:7:31,37 --> 0:7:32,98
All right, Jesus.


188
0:7:32,98 --> 0:9:32,98
