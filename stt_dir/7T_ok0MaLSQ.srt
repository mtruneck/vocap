1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,3



2
0:0:0,3 --> 0:0:1,8
MARGE PHELPS: Forget all the
rest of the scripture.


3
0:0:1,8 --> 0:0:3,69
Just think logically.


4
0:0:3,69 --> 0:0:4,83
It's delusional.


5
0:0:4,83 --> 0:0:6,62
These people are delusional.


6
0:0:6,62 --> 0:0:9,46
It's like they're all
mentally ill.


7
0:0:9,46 --> 0:0:11,39
You turned this country
over to the fags.


8
0:0:11,39 --> 0:0:12,325
You did it aggressively.


9
0:0:12,325 --> 0:0:13,746
You did it proactively.


10
0:0:13,746 --> 0:0:16,35
You did it in 1,000
different ways.


11
0:0:16,35 --> 0:0:18,338
Now we're coming home
in body bags.


12
0:0:18,338 --> 0:0:31,77



13
0:0:31,77 --> 0:0:34,51
FRED PHELPS: It is my opinion
that the news media is totally


14
0:0:34,51 --> 0:0:36,89
corrupt and totally--


15
0:0:36,89 --> 0:0:38,52
I mean totally--


16
0:0:38,52 --> 0:0:41,97
dedicated to the militant
fag agenda.


17
0:0:41,97 --> 0:0:47,84



18
0:0:47,84 --> 0:0:49,81
LIBBY ALVAREZ: This guy was
spitting on me and they


19
0:0:49,81 --> 0:0:52,35
knocked me down.


20
0:0:52,35 --> 0:0:54,25
I may have been 10
or something.


21
0:0:54,25 --> 0:0:56,19
SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: Judge not
less you be judged, you


22
0:0:56,19 --> 0:1:0,85
blankity blanking blah, blah,
blah that says, blah, blah.


23
0:1:0,85 --> 0:1:4,53
To which I have to say,
[INAUDIBLE] stop judging us.


24
0:1:4,53 --> 0:1:8,6
STEVE DRAIN: All these
do-gooder, lying-ass


25
0:1:8,6 --> 0:1:10,93
Christians.


26
0:1:10,93 --> 0:1:15,37
FRED PHELPS: Break these signs
out in some public place.


27
0:1:15,37 --> 0:1:19,87
Display them, and it will only
be a matter of minutes, if not


28
0:1:19,87 --> 0:1:23,98
seconds, before the same
kind of vicious fag


29
0:1:23,98 --> 0:1:25,98
attack, we call it.


30
0:1:25,98 --> 0:1:26,73
Fag attack.


31
0:1:26,73 --> 0:1:27,98
Fag attack.


32
0:1:27,98 --> 0:1:31,22



33
0:1:31,22 --> 0:1:33,1
DENISE HALL: I think when you
have that kind of hate speech


34
0:1:33,1 --> 0:1:35,8
against any one particular
group, other people are going


35
0:1:35,8 --> 0:1:37,89
to sit back and say,
wow, that's really


36
0:1:37,89 --> 0:1:39,14
going over the top.


37
0:1:39,14 --> 0:1:42,78



38
0:1:42,78 --> 0:1:46,66
MALE SPEAKER: You should
be burned at the stake.


39
0:1:46,66 --> 0:1:49,454
MALE SPEAKER: You filthy,
rotten, scum-sucking pig,


40
0:1:49,454 --> 0:1:51,39
[INAUDIBLE] you're
going to hell.


41
0:1:51,39 --> 0:1:55,262



42
0:1:55,262 --> 0:1:57,36
MARGE PHELPS: And this thing's
going in waves now.


43
0:1:57,36 --> 0:2:2,5
We go out and tell them, they
respond by aggressively


44
0:2:2,5 --> 0:2:3,44
rejecting the message.


45
0:2:3,44 --> 0:2:4,32
MALE SPEAKER: They're
pathetic.


46
0:2:4,32 --> 0:2:6,8
You people are pathetic.


47
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:7,65
MARGE PHELPS: You know know
who claims to be the most


48
0:2:7,65 --> 0:2:8,93
Christian in this country
nowadays?


49
0:2:8,93 --> 0:2:12,74
The veterans and the
politicians.


50
0:2:12,74 --> 0:2:14,84
That's why they're the ones
who fight us the hardest.


51
0:2:14,84 --> 0:2:23,71



52
0:2:23,71 --> 0:2:26,861
MALE SPEAKER: OK,
now, hey, guys.


53
0:2:26,861 --> 0:2:28,111
[INAUDIBLE].


54
0:2:28,111 --> 0:2:32,1



55
0:2:32,1 --> 0:2:34,99
TIM PHELPS: I remember I think
the worst one I went to was


56
0:2:34,99 --> 0:2:38,2
either that weekend that
I left in 2007--


57
0:2:38,2 --> 0:2:42,1
my birthday present was to go
to Washington, DC, for the


58
0:2:42,1 --> 0:2:43,76
Veterans' Day parade.


59
0:2:43,76 --> 0:2:46,73
And so I was there and that
was kind of crazy.


60
0:2:46,73 --> 0:2:49,42
They chased us away when they're
all down listening to


61
0:2:49,42 --> 0:2:50,96
the speech and they all
come up the hill


62
0:2:50,96 --> 0:2:51,77
and we're right there.


63
0:2:51,77 --> 0:2:55,4
And we're right at the corner
when the parade turns around.


64
0:2:55,4 --> 0:2:57,46
And we were kind of trapped
there on the corner.


65
0:2:57,46 --> 0:2:59,51
And we tried to jump.


66
0:2:59,51 --> 0:3:2,5
I had two of the younger
kids like this.


67
0:3:2,5 --> 0:3:3,94
I'm shielding them
or whatever.


68
0:3:3,94 --> 0:3:7,3
And so we tried to
hop the barrier.


69
0:3:7,3 --> 0:3:10,16
And the cops pulled out there
batons, like, get back over,


70
0:3:10,16 --> 0:3:11,75
get back over.


71
0:3:11,75 --> 0:3:12,46
DENISE HALL: They're not asking


72
0:3:12,46 --> 0:3:14,74
anybody to hurt anybody.


73
0:3:14,74 --> 0:3:19,96
They're saying things that we
can all find terrible, but


74
0:3:19,96 --> 0:3:23,59
they're not saying, let's
go kill gay people.


75
0:3:23,59 --> 0:3:25,73
NARRATOR: During our time with
the Westboro Baptist Church,


76
0:3:25,73 --> 0:3:28,9
we found it increasingly
difficult to reconcile their


77
0:3:28,9 --> 0:3:30,26
hate speech with how well
they treated us.


78
0:3:30,26 --> 0:3:32,945
But the one thing we had to keep
reminding ourselves was


79
0:3:32,945 --> 0:3:35,98
that, to them, we were nothing
more than another platform to


80
0:3:35,98 --> 0:3:37,73
spread their message.


81
0:3:37,73 --> 0:3:40,5
DENISE HALL: For those of us who
live here and have lived


82
0:3:40,5 --> 0:3:44,9
here for a long time, we can
just drive by and go, OK,


83
0:3:44,9 --> 0:3:45,6
that's Fred.


84
0:3:45,6 --> 0:3:48,97
It's just such a shock to people
in other cities that


85
0:3:48,97 --> 0:3:51,18
think, does everybody in
Topeka feel like this?


86
0:3:51,18 --> 0:3:53,61
And would everybody in
Topeka get behind


87
0:3:53,61 --> 0:3:54,94
something like this?


88
0:3:54,94 --> 0:3:59,9
And, no, of course,
we wouldn't .


89
0:3:59,9 --> 0:4:2,11
GRUMPY: Anti-gays,
anti-America--


90
0:4:2,11 --> 0:4:3,45
you name it, he's against it.


91
0:4:3,45 --> 0:4:5,43
MALE SPEAKER: Have
a good evening.


92
0:4:5,43 --> 0:4:10,645
GRUMPY: I know personally a
child who died of AIDS because


93
0:4:10,645 --> 0:4:12,2
of a blood transmission.


94
0:4:12,2 --> 0:4:15,956
They picketed that
child's funeral.


95
0:4:15,956 --> 0:4:20,384
That [INAUDIBLE].


96
0:4:20,384 --> 0:4:21,519
DENISE HALL: Ted's kind of--


97
0:4:21,519 --> 0:4:24,9
there are good people in this
town that are trying to make


98
0:4:24,9 --> 0:4:26,33
the town grow and make
it look interesting.


99
0:4:26,33 --> 0:4:29,6
And then you have to think, oh
well, you get some company in


100
0:4:29,6 --> 0:4:32,48
from somewhere, and how much
does that hurt if they happen


101
0:4:32,48 --> 0:4:35,28
to drive by a bunch of picketers
and think, huh,


102
0:4:35,28 --> 0:4:39,1
should we move our families
and our company to Topeka?


103
0:4:39,1 --> 0:4:39,99
Hm.


104
0:4:39,99 --> 0:4:40,66
Well, let's see.


105
0:4:40,66 --> 0:4:43,6
Maybe we'll go to Omaha.


106
0:4:43,6 --> 0:4:51,68
STEVE DRAIN: I'm much more
fearful of neglecting my duty


107
0:4:51,68 --> 0:4:54,5
to my children to teach them
what the Lord requires of them


108
0:4:54,5 --> 0:4:59,54
than I am not having some
fleshly relationship with


109
0:4:59,54 --> 0:5:2,72
them, besides which, when we
talk about kids growing up


110
0:5:2,72 --> 0:5:7,37
that become adults, you don't
hang out with people who don't


111
0:5:7,37 --> 0:5:9,57
like the same kind of stuff
you like or do the


112
0:5:9,57 --> 0:5:10,4
same kind of you do.


113
0:5:10,4 --> 0:5:14,29
Everybody gravitates toward
people with common interests.


114
0:5:14,29 --> 0:5:16,4
NARRATOR: Steve's daughters,
Lauren and Taylor, were


115
0:5:16,4 --> 0:5:18,76
brought into the Westboro
fold as adolescents.


116
0:5:18,76 --> 0:5:21,71
Upon their arrival, the Drains
sharply changed their approach


117
0:5:21,71 --> 0:5:22,81
to parenting--


118
0:5:22,81 --> 0:5:26,86
no Christmas, no Halloween, no
Thanksgiving, no more rock


119
0:5:26,86 --> 0:5:29,96
bands, no more haircuts for the
girls, no more chocolate


120
0:5:29,96 --> 0:5:33,53
bunnies, or even What Would
Jesus Do? bracelets, and above


121
0:5:33,53 --> 0:5:35,35
all, no boys.


122
0:5:35,35 --> 0:5:37,306
TAYLOR DRAIN: God says
to warn them for him.


123
0:5:37,306 --> 0:5:38,773
These people don't obey him.


124
0:5:38,773 --> 0:5:40,24
They don't keep his
commandments.


125
0:5:40,24 --> 0:5:53,17



126
0:5:53,17 --> 0:5:55,68
STEVE DRAIN: Taylor, she
actually cut a music video not


127
0:5:55,68 --> 0:5:57,12
too long ago.


128
0:5:57,12 --> 0:5:59,1
She's a senior at Washburn
University now.


129
0:5:59,1 --> 0:6:2,53
You understand, she studies
computer information systems,


130
0:6:2,53 --> 0:6:6,16
but she likes the the look
and feel side of that.


131
0:6:6,16 --> 0:6:9,62
So for instance,
godhatesthemedia.com--


132
0:6:9,62 --> 0:6:10,81
that's basically her website.


133
0:6:10,81 --> 0:6:11,75
She put it together.


134
0:6:11,75 --> 0:6:15,97
Taylor also does the WBC video
news a couple times a week.


135
0:6:15,97 --> 0:6:17,8
It usually has been
[INAUDIBLE]


136
0:6:17,8 --> 0:6:18,32
Pastor Phelps.


137
0:6:18,32 --> 0:6:21,46
But here recently, some of the
other elder men have been


138
0:6:21,46 --> 0:6:23,88
breaking out and starting
to do some talking.


139
0:6:23,88 --> 0:6:25,55
And Taylor she switches that.


140
0:6:25,55 --> 0:6:27,59
She's got a little switcher
in there, in the studio.


141
0:6:27,59 --> 0:6:30,15
And she posts it herself
and sticks it up there.


142
0:6:30,15 --> 0:6:31,18
So it's pretty cool.


143
0:6:31,18 --> 0:6:33,41
TIM PHELPS: Taylor, she
was kind of quiet.


144
0:6:33,41 --> 0:6:36,73
Truthfully, I'm surprised that
she's there, because I thought


145
0:6:36,73 --> 0:6:42,4
that she was kind of attached
to some of those boys that


146
0:6:42,4 --> 0:6:43,61
left in her grade.


147
0:6:43,61 --> 0:6:44,74
I don't know.


148
0:6:44,74 --> 0:6:45,64
And her sister--


149
0:6:45,64 --> 0:6:47,94
I thought she was attached
to her sister.


150
0:6:47,94 --> 0:6:50,42
NARRATOR: Well into the second
hour of our interview, we


151
0:6:50,42 --> 0:6:52,86
noticed that Steve was still
hesitant to discuss the one


152
0:6:52,86 --> 0:6:54,76
topic on both of our minds--


153
0:6:54,76 --> 0:6:56,11
his daughter Lauren.


154
0:6:56,11 --> 0:6:58,16
STEVE DRAIN: These are kids for
a while, and then they're


155
0:6:58,16 --> 0:7:0,1
adults for a long time.


156
0:7:0,1 --> 0:7:3,81
And when they're adults, when
they come to that age--


157
0:7:3,81 --> 0:7:7,6
the age where they have a
moral responsibility for


158
0:7:7,6 --> 0:7:8,32
themselves--


159
0:7:8,32 --> 0:7:9,68
at least I'll know this.


160
0:7:9,68 --> 0:7:12,93
At least I'll know that
I did my duty to them.


161
0:7:12,93 --> 0:7:16,63
Because my life isn't about
pleasing myself.


162
0:7:16,63 --> 0:7:18,45
My life isn't about pleasing
my children.


163
0:7:18,45 --> 0:7:20,66
My life is about serving
my Lord.


164
0:7:20,66 --> 0:7:23,21



165
0:7:23,21 --> 0:7:27,98
LIBBY ALVAREZ: She never
was a true believer.


166
0:7:27,98 --> 0:7:29,92
You don't even want to get
me started on this girl.


167
0:7:29,92 --> 0:7:32,3
She always wanted to
go out with boys.


168
0:7:32,3 --> 0:7:35,28
I know that I have people-- even
after all that's left--


169
0:7:35,28 --> 0:7:38,87
come up to me and tell me how
she would take clothes to


170
0:7:38,87 --> 0:7:43,13
school and change into them
that were inappropriate.


171
0:7:43,13 --> 0:7:46,27
She snuck out all the time with
a guy from Topeka High


172
0:7:46,27 --> 0:7:47,59
and did stuff with him.


173
0:7:47,59 --> 0:7:48,45
TIM PHELPS: Then she
got caught because


174
0:7:48,45 --> 0:7:48,37
she had a flat tire.


175
0:7:48,37 --> 0:7:50,68
LIBBY ALVAREZ: She got a flat
tire and she got caught.


176
0:7:50,68 --> 0:7:52,57
NARRATOR: Lauren Drain was
expelled from the Westboro


177
0:7:52,57 --> 0:7:54,69
Baptist Church in 2007.


178
0:7:54,69 --> 0:7:57,21
She has been allowed no contact
with her mother and


179
0:7:57,21 --> 0:7:59,61
two younger siblings,
Boaz and Faith.


180
0:7:59,61 --> 0:8:4,86
STEVE DRAIN: I haven't spoken
to her probably in I'm going


181
0:8:4,86 --> 0:8:5,63
to say three years.


182
0:8:5,63 --> 0:8:6,87
I'm not really sure.


183
0:8:6,87 --> 0:8:8,705
But I think probably
three years since


184
0:8:8,705 --> 0:8:9,86
I've spoken to her.


185
0:8:9,86 --> 0:8:11,32
She's a grown woman now.


186
0:8:11,32 --> 0:8:15,44
It's way different than when
you're a little kid.


187
0:8:15,44 --> 0:8:19,3
When I have these little kids,
they're looking to Dad for


188
0:8:19,3 --> 0:8:20,89
some guidance.


189
0:8:20,89 --> 0:8:25,1
And I tell them, look, this is
what the scripture says here.


190
0:8:25,1 --> 0:8:26,98
This is the standard that
we have in this house.


191
0:8:26,98 --> 0:8:29,51
But now, she's is
a grown woman.


192
0:8:29,51 --> 0:8:31,45
First time I go to telling her
that what she's doing is


193
0:8:31,45 --> 0:8:32,97
wrong, she's going to tell
me to take a long


194
0:8:32,97 --> 0:8:34,496
walk on a short pier.


195
0:8:34,496 --> 0:8:35,32
LIBBY ALVAREZ: I'll tell
you what happened.


196
0:8:35,32 --> 0:8:36,52
There was this guy--


197
0:8:36,52 --> 0:8:38,86
I was responsible on YouTube
to put up videos.


198
0:8:38,86 --> 0:8:39,97
And so I was doing that.


199
0:8:39,97 --> 0:8:41,49
So this guy started
talking to me.


200
0:8:41,49 --> 0:8:42,12
And then Lauren started putting


201
0:8:42,12 --> 0:8:43,39
up videos or something.


202
0:8:43,39 --> 0:8:43,98
I don't know why she
was on there.


203
0:8:43,98 --> 0:8:45,32
Then she started talking
to this guy.


204
0:8:45,32 --> 0:8:47,4
And this guy was trying
to flirt with us, OK?


205
0:8:47,4 --> 0:8:50,23
So apparently, she was--


206
0:8:50,23 --> 0:8:50,43
TIM PHELPS: Corresponding.


207
0:8:50,43 --> 0:8:52,26
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Yeah, she was
corresponding with him.


208
0:8:52,26 --> 0:8:55,71
And she ended up stealing her
mother's credit card--


209
0:8:55,71 --> 0:8:56,36
TIM PHELPS: Bought
a plane ticket.


210
0:8:56,36 --> 0:8:57,71
LIBBY ALVAREZ: --and bought
a plane ticket for


211
0:8:57,71 --> 0:9:0,9
him to come to Kansas.


212
0:9:0,9 --> 0:9:3,2
STEVE DRAIN: Look, she's not
a country mile from a


213
0:9:3,2 --> 0:9:5,48
Bible-believing Christian,
I can tell you right now.


214
0:9:5,48 --> 0:9:6,73
She lives with a man.


215
0:9:6,73 --> 0:9:9,84



216
0:9:9,84 --> 0:9:12,2
She lives with a man.


217
0:9:12,2 --> 0:9:13,45
She's not married to him.


218
0:9:13,45 --> 0:9:16,54



219
0:9:16,54 --> 0:9:18,82
It's kind of the fundamental
deal right there.


220
0:9:18,82 --> 0:9:21,4
NARRATOR: As we looked around
the Drain family home, we


221
0:9:21,4 --> 0:9:22,52
noticed that not a
single picture of


222
0:9:22,52 --> 0:9:24,25
Lauren Drain remained.


223
0:9:24,25 --> 0:9:28,46
She had been erased, as
if she never existed.


224
0:9:28,46 --> 0:9:31,71
STEVE DRAIN: Thankfully, the
Lord has been merciful to me.


225
0:9:31,71 --> 0:9:33,73
He's given me children that
I didn't even have


226
0:9:33,73 --> 0:9:35,1
when I came up here.


227
0:9:35,1 --> 0:9:36,98
No, he gave me Bo and
Faith after we


228
0:9:36,98 --> 0:9:39,28
even were living here.


229
0:9:39,28 --> 0:9:42,3
I got an eight-year-old daughter
who knows more Bible


230
0:9:42,3 --> 0:9:47,73
than a good chunk of preachers
in Topeka, Kansas.


231
0:9:47,73 --> 0:9:49,787
BOAZ DRAIN: Faith, you always
look weird, so it doesn't


232
0:9:49,787 --> 0:9:52,122
really-- you can't tell
the difference.


233
0:9:52,122 --> 0:9:53,99
FAITH DRAIN: Shut up.


234
0:9:53,99 --> 0:9:55,45
STEVE DRAIN: Yeah, she called
me on my birthday.


235
0:9:55,45 --> 0:9:56,85
I think it was about
three years ago.


236
0:9:56,85 --> 0:10:0,8
She called me and she
was very cheerful.


237
0:10:0,8 --> 0:10:4,41
And she said, you were right
about everything you tried to


238
0:10:4,41 --> 0:10:6,56
tell me, Dad.


239
0:10:6,56 --> 0:10:7,525
And then she hung up.


240
0:10:7,525 --> 0:10:10,55
And that was the last
I've heard from her.


241
0:10:10,55 --> 0:10:12,89
NARRATOR: While she did provide
us with pictures and


242
0:10:12,89 --> 0:10:16,58
this video, Lauren Drain did not
grant Vice an interview.


243
0:10:16,58 --> 0:10:19,5
However, she did ask us
to plug her book.


244
0:10:19,5 --> 0:10:24,35
It comes out in 2013.


245
0:10:24,35 --> 0:10:26,8
LIBBY ALVAREZ: The views were
becoming more extreme.


246
0:10:26,8 --> 0:10:28,82
The main thing that I had a
problem with was praying for a


247
0:10:28,82 --> 0:10:30,22
specific person to die.


248
0:10:30,22 --> 0:10:33,85
But since I had lived there my
entire life and all that


249
0:10:33,85 --> 0:10:34,89
seemed normal to me--


250
0:10:34,89 --> 0:10:35,96
TIM PHELPS: You went
went along with it.


251
0:10:35,96 --> 0:10:37,5
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Yeah, I
went along with it.


252
0:10:37,5 --> 0:10:40,83
And I needed a personal breaking
point, like something


253
0:10:40,83 --> 0:10:41,54
that happened just to me.


254
0:10:41,54 --> 0:10:46,22
And that happened when my
family and I went on a


255
0:10:46,22 --> 0:10:48,9
vacation to Puerto Rico.


256
0:10:48,9 --> 0:10:50,32
We came back, my grandpa
asked for pictures.


257
0:10:50,32 --> 0:10:52,87
So the one that I gave him--
and only good one--


258
0:10:52,87 --> 0:10:56,4
me and my sister happened to
be wearing a bikini in it.


259
0:10:56,4 --> 0:10:59,18
They put out on a table so
everyone going to church--


260
0:10:59,18 --> 0:11:0,29
my grandma and grandpa,
they liked it.


261
0:11:0,29 --> 0:11:2,22
They put it out front so
everyone could look at it.


262
0:11:2,22 --> 0:11:4,24
After church, I walked out there
and I saw the picture


263
0:11:4,24 --> 0:11:5,82
had been moved way
to the back.


264
0:11:5,82 --> 0:11:7,82
And I just thought, oh, crap.


265
0:11:7,82 --> 0:11:9,44
Something bad's going
to happen.


266
0:11:9,44 --> 0:11:10,87
STEVE DRAIN: There aren't any
other options in life.


267
0:11:10,87 --> 0:11:13,49
You either warn the wicked or
you don't warn the wicked.


268
0:11:13,49 --> 0:11:17,5
You warn the righteous or you
don't warn the righteous.


269
0:11:17,5 --> 0:11:18,42
LIBBY ALVAREZ: We had
these meetings.


270
0:11:18,42 --> 0:11:20,27
I had been to them with
other people.


271
0:11:20,27 --> 0:11:22,65
And I mean, I know how
nervous I got there.


272
0:11:22,65 --> 0:11:24,63
And then it was my turn
for a meeting.


273
0:11:24,63 --> 0:11:28,55
There's about 30 people around
you in a big rectangle.


274
0:11:28,55 --> 0:11:29,92
TIM PHELPS: It's like
a verbal stoning.


275
0:11:29,92 --> 0:11:30,69
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Exactly.


276
0:11:30,69 --> 0:11:32,42
That's exactly what is,
a verbal stoning.


277
0:11:32,42 --> 0:11:35,49
Everyone, they were saying
I don't help out enough.


278
0:11:35,49 --> 0:11:39,16
And then his dad said that I
was chaff and that the wind


279
0:11:39,16 --> 0:11:41,35
was going to come and
blow me away.


280
0:11:41,35 --> 0:11:44,5
And it's just like, sitting
there listening to all this,


281
0:11:44,5 --> 0:11:46,75
you obviously don't
want me here.


282
0:11:46,75 --> 0:11:48,65
It actually opened
my eyes a lot.


283
0:11:48,65 --> 0:11:50,77
So every time I get sad
sometimes about leaving and


284
0:11:50,77 --> 0:11:54,35
missing my family, I think about
that, because they are


285
0:11:54,35 --> 0:11:55,97
not the honest, hard-working
people that I


286
0:11:55,97 --> 0:11:57,22
thought that they were.


287
0:11:57,22 --> 0:12:0,76



288
0:12:0,76 --> 0:12:2,1
Sorry.


289
0:12:2,1 --> 0:12:5,6



290
0:12:5,6 --> 0:12:8,37
Everyone kept calling me and
they were telling me, stop


291
0:12:8,37 --> 0:12:9,6
dishonoring your parents.


292
0:12:9,6 --> 0:12:11,86
Another one said, you need
to quit your job.


293
0:12:11,86 --> 0:12:13,14
Then, my grandpa called.


294
0:12:13,14 --> 0:12:14,97
He said, you're not thinking
about leaving, are you?


295
0:12:14,97 --> 0:12:16,11
And then I said, no.


296
0:12:16,11 --> 0:12:18,42
And in that moment, I was
telling the truth, because I


297
0:12:18,42 --> 0:12:20,46
didn't think I could leave.


298
0:12:20,46 --> 0:12:23,4
I didn't think that was an
option for me to leave.


299
0:12:23,4 --> 0:12:26,89
I just kind of had a sudden
realization that I needed to


300
0:12:26,89 --> 0:12:29,26
get out there.


301
0:12:29,26 --> 0:12:31,56
It just overpowered me that
I needed to leave.


302
0:12:31,56 --> 0:12:33,46
The opportunity presented
itself.


303
0:12:33,46 --> 0:12:36,54
I had to do it, or it wasn't
going to happen.


304
0:12:36,54 --> 0:12:39,39



305
0:12:39,39 --> 0:12:41,88
My dad called and I
didn't answer it.


306
0:12:41,88 --> 0:12:43,56
He left a message, and
I listened to it.


307
0:12:43,56 --> 0:12:48,16



308
0:12:48,16 --> 0:12:50,9
He said, I hope you're having
a good day, and everything


309
0:12:50,9 --> 0:12:51,24
will be fine.


310
0:12:51,24 --> 0:12:54,55
You just need to talk
to everyone.


311
0:12:54,55 --> 0:12:58,2
And we can get this result.


312
0:12:58,2 --> 0:13:0,265
But I knew that that wasn't
going to happen.


313
0:13:0,265 --> 0:13:9,31



314
0:13:9,31 --> 0:13:10,78
And then I left.


315
0:13:10,78 --> 0:13:17,25



316
0:13:17,25 --> 0:13:18,28
Shirley sent me an email.


317
0:13:18,28 --> 0:13:22,22
And she said, your mom and your
dad and your sister want


318
0:13:22,22 --> 0:13:25,58
no communication with you.


319
0:13:25,58 --> 0:13:27,65
Remember earlier, when I said
it was an unspoken rule that


320
0:13:27,65 --> 0:13:28,52
you can't talk to them?


321
0:13:28,52 --> 0:13:30,41
So there, I still have
that it writing.


322
0:13:30,41 --> 0:13:36,38



323
0:13:36,38 --> 0:13:39,36
TIM PHELPS: Tara and James--


324
0:13:39,36 --> 0:13:43,59
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Marie,
Josh, you, Hez-


325
0:13:43,59 --> 0:13:44,39
TIM PHELPS: Michael, David.


326
0:13:44,39 --> 0:13:44,815
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Oh, yeah.


327
0:13:44,815 --> 0:13:46,22
Forgot about them.


328
0:13:46,22 --> 0:13:46,73
TIM PHELPS: Mechiah.


329
0:13:46,73 --> 0:13:49,21
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Oh, yeah.


330
0:13:49,21 --> 0:13:50,655
TIM PHELPS: Josh Phelps.


331
0:13:50,655 --> 0:13:51,38
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Oh, yeah.


332
0:13:51,38 --> 0:13:51,85
Geez.


333
0:13:51,85 --> 0:13:52,71
TIM PHELPS: We can't find him.


334
0:13:52,71 --> 0:13:54,4
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Yeah.


335
0:13:54,4 --> 0:13:55,4
TIM PHELPS: From
our generation.


336
0:13:55,4 --> 0:13:59,8
There's obviously Kate and Carl,
Teresa, Bill, and Mary.


337
0:13:59,8 --> 0:14:3,8
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Yeah, there's
older ones that left, too.


338
0:14:3,8 --> 0:14:6,8
Well, I still have problems,
especially when I see a


339
0:14:6,8 --> 0:14:8,44
homosexual couple.


340
0:14:8,44 --> 0:14:11,5
I still am just like, oh, man.


341
0:14:11,5 --> 0:14:13,185
What's going on over there?


342
0:14:13,185 --> 0:14:15,93
TIM PHELPS: The only thing I
have a problem with, I guess--


343
0:14:15,93 --> 0:14:19,38
I learned pretty quick how to
be able to manipulate my way


344
0:14:19,38 --> 0:14:21,75
through stuff.


345
0:14:21,75 --> 0:14:23,19
LIBBY ALVAREZ: I don't
know how to do that.


346
0:14:23,19 --> 0:14:24,75
TIM PHELPS: I usually don't
even use my last name


347
0:14:24,75 --> 0:14:26,19
unless I have to.


348
0:14:26,19 --> 0:14:29,42
Not that I'm ashamed of it, but
that I don't want to be


349
0:14:29,42 --> 0:14:31,92
judged is, I guess, the
word I could use, on--


350
0:14:31,92 --> 0:14:33,45
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Yeah, exactly.


351
0:14:33,45 --> 0:14:36,36
TIM PHELPS: I went into an
interview the other day.


352
0:14:36,36 --> 0:14:37,56
I was looking for
a second job.


353
0:14:37,56 --> 0:14:39,28
And I went into the interview,
and he goes, Tim


354
0:14:39,28 --> 0:14:40,465
Phelps, from Topeka?


355
0:14:40,465 --> 0:14:41,88
I'm not even going to ask you.


356
0:14:41,88 --> 0:14:42,54
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Oh, god.


357
0:14:42,54 --> 0:14:44,295
TIM PHELPS: And I was like,
you can if you want.


358
0:14:44,295 --> 0:14:46,89
And he's like, you know what
question I was going to ask.


359
0:14:46,89 --> 0:14:48,76
And then he didn't ask it.


360
0:14:48,76 --> 0:14:49,56
LIBBY ALVAREZ: You should
have said something.


361
0:14:49,56 --> 0:14:50,5
TIM PHELPS: It's
not a big deal.


362
0:14:50,5 --> 0:14:52,43
No, I just let him
do his interview.


363
0:14:52,43 --> 0:14:54,448
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Oh,
that's weird.


364
0:14:54,448 --> 0:14:55,549
If you don't get it, it's
because he probably thinks


365
0:14:55,549 --> 0:14:56,336
that you're still there.


366
0:14:56,336 --> 0:14:56,81
I'm just kidding.


367
0:14:56,81 --> 0:14:58,67
TIM PHELPS: Well, I guess
I could have been.


368
0:14:58,67 --> 0:14:59,81
But I don't care.


369
0:14:59,81 --> 0:15:1,29
LIBBY ALVAREZ: Yeah.


370
0:15:1,29 --> 0:15:2,54
FRED PHELPS: Try to stop us!


371
0:15:2,54 --> 0:15:17,58



372
0:15:17,58 --> 0:15:19,63
STEVE DRAIN: I'm having this
interview with you.


373
0:15:19,63 --> 0:15:21,68
And you know, we hit
it off pretty well.


374
0:15:21,68 --> 0:15:27,4
But it's your vocation to
be interested in fringe


375
0:15:27,4 --> 0:15:28,29
personalities.


376
0:15:28,29 --> 0:15:41,11



377
0:15:41,11 --> 0:15:43,33
Imagine being good
friends with me.


378
0:15:43,33 --> 0:15:45,145
We're not going to be
bowling buddies.


379
0:15:45,145 --> 0:15:46,395
We're just not going to.


380
0:15:46,395 --> 0:17:46,395
