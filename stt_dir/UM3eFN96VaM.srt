1
0:0:7,368 --> 0:0:10,238
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.


2
0:0:10,238 --> 0:0:16,347
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.


3
0:0:16,347 --> 0:0:18,916
I pray thee,
good Mercutio, let's retire.


4
0:0:18,916 --> 0:0:20,819
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.


5
0:0:20,819 --> 0:0:22,187
The day is hot.


6
0:0:22,187 --> 0:0:24,991
Blah, blah, blah.


7
0:0:24,991 --> 0:0:26,426
The Capulets abroad!


8
0:0:26,426 --> 0:0:28,929
Ha ha ha!


9
0:0:28,929 --> 0:0:34,503
If we meet we shall not
'scape a brawl.


10
0:0:34,503 --> 0:0:36,6
For now
these hot days,


11
0:0:36,6 --> 0:0:40,544
is the mad
blood stirring.


12
0:0:40,544 --> 0:0:42,46
Mercutio,
let's retire.


13
0:0:42,46 --> 0:0:45,617
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah!


14
0:0:45,617 --> 0:0:48,21
Thou art like one
of these fellows


15
0:0:48,21 --> 0:0:50,524
that when he enters
the confines of a tavern


16
0:0:50,524 --> 0:0:52,526
claps me his sword
on the table,


17
0:0:52,526 --> 0:0:55,3
and says, "God send me
no need of thee:"


18
0:0:55,3 --> 0:0:56,532
blah, blah,
blah, blah;


19
0:0:56,532 --> 0:0:58,534
and by the operation
of the second cup,


20
0:0:58,534 --> 0:1:0,37
draws him on
the drawer,


21
0:1:0,37 --> 0:1:1,538
when indeed
there is no need.


22
0:1:1,538 --> 0:1:3,41
Am I like
such a fellow?


23
0:1:3,41 --> 0:1:4,542
Nay and there were
two such


24
0:1:4,542 --> 0:1:6,45
we should have
none shortly,


25
0:1:6,45 --> 0:1:7,546
for the one would kill
the other.


26
0:1:7,546 --> 0:1:9,516
Why thou hast
quarreled with a man


27
0:1:9,516 --> 0:1:10,817
for coughing
in the street,


28
0:1:10,817 --> 0:1:13,788
because he hath wakened thy dog
that hath lain asleep


29
0:1:13,788 --> 0:1:15,56
in the sun.


30
0:1:15,56 --> 0:1:16,558
Blah, blah, blah!


31
0:1:16,558 --> 0:1:22,498
And thou wilt tutor me
from quarreling! Hah!


32
0:1:22,498 --> 0:1:25,2
Mercutio...


33
0:1:25,2 --> 0:1:32,344
By my head,
here come the Capulets.


34
0:1:32,344 --> 0:1:55,308
By my heel,
I care not.


35
0:1:55,308 --> 0:1:58,312
Gentlemen, good den.


36
0:1:58,312 --> 0:2:0,48
Good den.


37
0:2:0,48 --> 0:2:4,553
A word
with one of you.


38
0:2:4,553 --> 0:2:7,557
And but one word
with one of us.


39
0:2:7,557 --> 0:2:9,59
Couple it
with something,


40
0:2:9,59 --> 0:2:16,68
make it a word
and a blow.


41
0:2:16,68 --> 0:2:19,506
You shall find me
apt enough to that, sir,


42
0:2:19,506 --> 0:2:20,841
and you will
give me occasion.


43
0:2:20,841 --> 0:2:27,517
Can you not take some occasion
without the giving?


44
0:2:27,517 --> 0:2:30,354
Mercutio, thou
consortest with Romeo.


45
0:2:30,354 --> 0:2:32,22
Consort? Ha ha ha!


46
0:2:32,22 --> 0:2:34,325
What dost thou
make us minstrels?


47
0:2:34,325 --> 0:2:35,827
Ha ha ha!


48
0:2:35,827 --> 0:2:37,53
An you make
minstrels of us,


49
0:2:37,53 --> 0:2:40,33
you look to hear
nothing but discords.


50
0:2:40,33 --> 0:2:42,836
Here's my fiddlestick.


51
0:2:42,836 --> 0:2:45,106
Here's that shall
make you dance.


52
0:2:45,106 --> 0:2:46,475
Zounds! Consort!


53
0:2:46,475 --> 0:2:49,44
We talk here in
the public haunt of men.


54
0:2:49,44 --> 0:2:51,47
Either withdraw unto
some private place,


55
0:2:51,47 --> 0:2:53,49
or reason coldly
of your grievances,


56
0:2:53,49 --> 0:2:54,552
or else depart;


57
0:2:54,552 --> 0:2:56,555
here all eyes gaze on us.


58
0:2:56,555 --> 0:2:59,57
Men's eyes
were made to look,


59
0:2:59,57 --> 0:3:0,56
and let them gaze.


60
0:3:0,56 --> 0:3:2,61
Mercutio!


61
0:3:2,61 --> 0:3:3,564
I will not budge for
no man's pleasure, I.


62
0:3:3,564 --> 0:3:7,68
Well, peace be
with you, sir,


63
0:3:7,68 --> 0:3:9,3
here comes my man.


64
0:3:9,3 --> 0:3:21,19
Mercutio!


65
0:3:21,19 --> 0:3:22,421
Tybalt.


66
0:3:22,421 --> 0:3:24,924
Romeo, the love
I bear thee


67
0:3:24,924 --> 0:3:27,194
can afford no better
term than this--


68
0:3:27,194 --> 0:3:30,98
thou art a villain.


69
0:3:30,98 --> 0:3:33,603
Tybalt, the reason that
I have to love thee


70
0:3:33,603 --> 0:3:36,105
doth much excuse
the appertaining rage


71
0:3:36,105 --> 0:3:37,608
to such a greeting--


72
0:3:37,608 --> 0:3:39,676
villain am I none.


73
0:3:39,676 --> 0:3:41,179
Therefore farewell,


74
0:3:41,179 --> 0:3:43,181
I see thou knowest
not me.


75
0:3:43,181 --> 0:3:44,95
Ha ha ha!


76
0:3:44,95 --> 0:3:47,554
Boy...


77
0:3:47,554 --> 0:3:51,559
This shall not excuse the injuries
thou hast done me,


78
0:3:51,559 --> 0:3:54,62
therefore turn
and draw.


79
0:3:54,62 --> 0:3:57,66
I do protest
I never injured thee,


80
0:3:57,66 --> 0:3:59,836
but love thee better
than thou canst devise.


81
0:3:59,836 --> 0:4:2,606
Till thou shalt know
the reason of my love.


82
0:4:2,606 --> 0:4:4,109
And so, good Capulet,


83
0:4:4,109 --> 0:4:9,515
which name I tender
as dearly as mine own,


84
0:4:9,515 --> 0:4:15,39
be satisfied.


85
0:4:15,39 --> 0:4:19,28
Ha ha ha!


86
0:4:19,28 --> 0:4:36,75
No, no.


87
0:4:36,75 --> 0:4:40,556
Ha ha ha!


88
0:4:40,556 --> 0:4:42,58
No, Mercutio.


89
0:4:42,58 --> 0:4:44,61
O calm, dishonorable,
vile submission!


90
0:4:44,61 --> 0:4:45,562
No, Mercutio, no!


91
0:4:45,562 --> 0:4:47,65
Leave me...


92
0:4:47,65 --> 0:4:49,1
Tybalt, you ratcatcher!


93
0:4:49,1 --> 0:4:51,737
What wouldest thou
have with me?


94
0:4:51,737 --> 0:4:53,238
Good King of Cats,


95
0:4:53,238 --> 0:4:56,76
nothing but one of
your nine lives,


96
0:4:56,76 --> 0:4:58,312
that I mean to
make bold withal...


97
0:4:58,312 --> 0:5:1,316
And as you shall
use me hereafter...


98
0:5:1,316 --> 0:5:3,82
Dry-beat the rest
of the eight.


99
0:5:3,82 --> 0:5:6,89
Please, good Mercutio.


100
0:5:6,89 --> 0:5:9,593
Will you pluck your sword
out of his pilcher


101
0:5:9,593 --> 0:5:11,96
by the ears?


102
0:5:11,96 --> 0:5:12,597
Make haste,


103
0:5:12,597 --> 0:5:22,543
lest mine be about your ears
ere it be out.


104
0:5:22,543 --> 0:5:24,179
I am for you, sir.


105
0:5:24,179 --> 0:5:25,681
Ha ha ha!


106
0:5:25,681 --> 0:5:29,552
Gentle Mercutio,
put thy rapier up.


107
0:5:29,552 --> 0:5:39,832
Come, come.


108
0:5:39,832 --> 0:5:41,568
Benvolio, beat down
their weapons!


109
0:5:41,568 --> 0:5:43,57
Gentlemen, for shame!
Forbear this outrage!


110
0:5:43,57 --> 0:5:46,74
The Prince expressly hath
forbid this bandying


111
0:5:46,74 --> 0:5:47,643
in Verona streets.


112
0:5:47,643 --> 0:5:49,578
Tybalt!


113
0:5:49,578 --> 0:5:51,815
Mercutio!


114
0:5:51,815 --> 0:5:53,984
Leave us!


115
0:5:53,984 --> 0:5:55,987
Leave us away,
you coward!


116
0:5:55,987 --> 0:6:8,17
Go hang thyself.


117
0:6:8,17 --> 0:6:9,604
Uh!


118
0:6:9,604 --> 0:6:36,272
Ha ha ha!


119
0:6:36,272 --> 0:6:39,643
Ha ha ha! Hey!


120
0:6:39,643 --> 0:6:52,193
Ha ha ha!


121
0:6:52,193 --> 0:6:53,394
Ha ha ha!


122
0:6:53,394 --> 0:6:58,668
Hey!


123
0:6:58,668 --> 0:7:0,17
Aah!


124
0:7:0,17 --> 0:7:5,677
Cut his hair, Tybalt!


125
0:7:5,677 --> 0:7:19,629
Ha ha ha!


126
0:7:19,629 --> 0:7:21,632
Hey!


127
0:7:21,632 --> 0:7:26,137
Keep your distance, Tybalt.


128
0:7:26,137 --> 0:7:32,646
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!


129
0:7:32,646 --> 0:7:37,418
Keep away, coward!


130
0:7:37,418 --> 0:7:43,66
Make haste, Tybalt,
we cannot wait all day.


131
0:7:43,66 --> 0:7:48,667
Ah, mother's baby
has dropped his sword.


132
0:7:48,667 --> 0:7:53,94
Hey!


133
0:7:53,94 --> 0:7:54,942
Tybalt, no!


134
0:7:54,942 --> 0:7:58,179
Abstain from
this crusade!


135
0:7:58,179 --> 0:7:59,681
Tybalt, go!


136
0:7:59,681 --> 0:8:14,199
Mercutio, come down!


137
0:8:14,199 --> 0:8:15,702
Begone, begone...


138
0:8:15,702 --> 0:8:27,16
Fly, Tybalt.
Fly away.


139
0:8:27,16 --> 0:8:39,165
I am hurt.


140
0:8:39,165 --> 0:8:41,669
Uh!


141
0:8:41,669 --> 0:8:43,404
I am hurt.


142
0:8:43,404 --> 0:8:45,207
What! Art thou hurt?


143
0:8:45,207 --> 0:8:48,678
A scratch, a scratch,


144
0:8:48,678 --> 0:8:50,747
marry 'tis enough.


145
0:8:50,747 --> 0:8:53,751
Courage, man, the hurt
cannot be much.


146
0:8:53,751 --> 0:8:57,689
No, 'tis not so deep
as a well,


147
0:8:57,689 --> 0:9:0,693
nor so wide as
a church door,


148
0:9:0,693 --> 0:9:2,195
but 'tis enough;


149
0:9:2,195 --> 0:9:4,197
you ask for me
tomorrow,


150
0:9:4,197 --> 0:9:8,604
and you shall find me
a grave man.


151
0:9:8,604 --> 0:9:11,206
Where is my page?


152
0:9:11,206 --> 0:9:14,21
Go, villain,
and fetch me a surgeon.


153
0:9:14,21 --> 0:9:15,713
Fetch me a surgeon!


154
0:9:15,713 --> 0:9:17,715
Ha ha ha!


155
0:9:17,715 --> 0:9:31,666
Did he hurt you?


156
0:9:31,666 --> 0:9:35,172
Why the devil
came you between us?


157
0:9:35,172 --> 0:9:37,674
I was hurt
under your arm.


158
0:9:37,674 --> 0:9:49,69
I thought all
for the best, I...


159
0:9:49,69 --> 0:9:52,194
Help me into some house,
Benvolio,


160
0:9:52,194 --> 0:9:58,201
or I shall faint.


161
0:9:58,201 --> 0:10:0,204
Whoa!


162
0:10:0,204 --> 0:10:1,705
Whoa!


163
0:10:1,705 --> 0:10:3,708
Whoa!


164
0:10:3,708 --> 0:10:5,211
Whoa!


165
0:10:5,211 --> 0:10:8,214
Yay!


166
0:10:8,214 --> 0:10:15,724
A plague o'
both your houses!


167
0:10:15,724 --> 0:10:22,666
They have made
worms' meat of me.


168
0:10:22,666 --> 0:10:24,668
I have it,


169
0:10:24,668 --> 0:10:30,176
and soundly too...


170
0:10:30,176 --> 0:10:31,844
Your houses!


171
0:10:31,844 --> 0:10:35,182
He jests!


172
0:10:35,182 --> 0:10:40,689
Mercutio!


173
0:10:40,689 --> 0:10:44,694
Romeo, Romeo...


174
0:10:44,694 --> 0:11:8,225
brave Mercutio's dead.


175
0:11:8,225 --> 0:11:10,728
This day's black fate,


176
0:11:10,728 --> 0:11:13,32
on more days doth depend.


177
0:11:13,32 --> 0:11:17,571
This but begins the woe
others must end.


178
0:11:17,571 --> 0:11:20,675
He gone in triumph!


179
0:11:20,675 --> 0:11:23,178
And Mercutio slain!


180
0:11:23,178 --> 0:11:27,684
Away to heaven,
respective lenity,


181
0:11:27,684 --> 0:11:32,691
and fire-eyed fury
be my conduct now!


182
0:11:32,691 --> 0:11:35,695
Tybalt!


183
0:11:35,695 --> 0:11:38,264
Tybalt!


184
0:11:38,264 --> 0:11:44,706
Romeo!


185
0:11:44,706 --> 0:11:46,709
Tybalt!


186
0:11:46,709 --> 0:11:49,479
Romeo!


187
0:11:49,479 --> 0:11:53,17
This way!


188
0:11:53,17 --> 0:11:55,219
Tybalt!


189
0:11:55,219 --> 0:11:57,723
Romeo!


190
0:11:57,723 --> 0:12:6,234
Tybalt!


191
0:12:6,234 --> 0:12:9,238
Now, Tybalt...


192
0:12:9,238 --> 0:12:11,24
Take the villain
back again,


193
0:12:11,24 --> 0:12:13,744
that late thou gav'st me;


194
0:12:13,744 --> 0:12:15,245
for Mercutio's soul


195
0:12:15,245 --> 0:12:18,249
is but a little way
above our heads,


196
0:12:18,249 --> 0:12:21,186
staying for thine
to keep him company:


197
0:12:21,186 --> 0:12:23,69
either thou, or l, or both,


198
0:12:23,69 --> 0:12:25,191
must go with him!


199
0:12:25,191 --> 0:12:31,133
Aah!


200
0:12:31,133 --> 0:12:40,145
Let him go!
Let him go!


201
0:12:40,145 --> 0:12:44,483
Sword, Romeo.


202
0:12:44,483 --> 0:12:45,986
O thou wretched boy,


203
0:12:45,986 --> 0:12:47,988
that didst
consort him here,


204
0:12:47,988 --> 0:12:49,614
shalt with him hence.


205
0:12:49,614 --> 0:13:4,99
This shall
determine that.


206
0:13:4,99 --> 0:13:8,104
Hit the feet, Romeo!


207
0:13:8,104 --> 0:13:19,786
Protect the eyes, Romeo!


208
0:13:19,786 --> 0:13:36,73
Give me your sword.


209
0:13:36,73 --> 0:14:8,616
Watch his feet!


210
0:14:8,616 --> 0:14:24,7
Hyah!


211
0:14:24,7 --> 0:14:26,573
Give me the sword!


212
0:14:26,573 --> 0:14:27,908
The sword!


213
0:14:27,908 --> 0:15:2,319
The sword!


214
0:15:2,319 --> 0:15:26,483
Romeo! Romeo!


215
0:15:26,483 --> 0:15:27,552
The sword!


216
0:15:27,552 --> 0:15:29,487
The sword!


217
0:15:29,487 --> 0:15:31,9
Give it to me!


218
0:15:31,9 --> 0:15:32,658
Your sword, Romeo!


219
0:15:32,658 --> 0:15:38,433
The sword, Romeo!


220
0:15:38,433 --> 0:15:47,11
Aah!


221
0:15:47,11 --> 0:15:54,22
Tybalt!


222
0:15:54,22 --> 0:15:56,522
Romeo, away, be gone.


223
0:15:56,522 --> 0:15:58,25
The citizens are up.


224
0:15:58,25 --> 0:15:59,526
Stand not amazed,


225
0:15:59,526 --> 0:16:1,529
the Prince will
doom thee death,


226
0:16:1,529 --> 0:16:2,897
if thou art taken.


227
0:16:2,897 --> 0:16:4,533
Hence, go away!


228
0:16:4,533 --> 0:16:10,374
Romeo!


229
0:16:10,374 --> 0:16:14,46
Oh, I am fortune's fool!


230
0:16:14,46 --> 0:16:23,257
Oh, Romeo!
Away, away!


231
0:16:23,257 --> 0:16:25,56
A curse on the Montagues!


232
0:16:25,56 --> 0:16:28,898
Oh, Tybalt!


233
0:16:28,898 --> 0:16:30,567
Tybalt! Tybalt!


234
0:16:30,567 --> 0:16:32,569
The best friend I had,


235
0:16:32,569 --> 0:16:35,84
oh, courteous Tybalt,
honest gentleman,


236
0:16:35,84 --> 0:16:39,345
that ever I should live
to see thee dead!


237
0:16:39,345 --> 0:16:40,58
Oh, God!


238
0:16:40,58 --> 0:16:42,582
Did Romeo's hand
shed Tybalt's blood?


239
0:16:42,582 --> 0:16:45,586
It did, it did,
alas the day, it did!


240
0:16:45,586 --> 0:16:47,88
Oh, nurse,


241
0:16:47,88 --> 0:16:51,594
oh, serpent heart,
hid with a flow'ring face!


242
0:16:51,594 --> 0:16:54,598
Was ever book containing
such vile matter


243
0:16:54,598 --> 0:17:1,606
so fairly bound?


244
0:17:1,606 --> 0:17:3,608
There's no faith,
no trust,


245
0:17:3,608 --> 0:17:5,111
no honesty in men;


246
0:17:5,111 --> 0:17:7,614
all perjured,
all forsworn,


247
0:17:7,614 --> 0:17:10,117
all naught,
all dissemblers.


248
0:17:10,117 --> 0:17:11,986
Shame come to Romeo.


249
0:17:11,986 --> 0:17:15,624
Blistered be thy tongue
for such a wish.


250
0:17:15,624 --> 0:17:18,128
He was not born
to shame.


251
0:17:18,128 --> 0:17:20,898
Upon his brow shame
is ashamed to sit.


252
0:17:20,898 --> 0:17:23,501
Will you speak well of him
that killed your cousin?


253
0:17:23,501 --> 0:17:31,78
Shall I speak ill of him
that is my husband?


254
0:17:31,78 --> 0:17:33,581
Poor my lord,


255
0:17:33,581 --> 0:17:36,84
what tongue shall
smooth thy name


256
0:17:36,84 --> 0:17:38,588
when I
thy three-hours wife


257
0:17:38,588 --> 0:17:43,427
have mangled it?


258
0:17:43,427 --> 0:17:46,998
But wherefore villain,
didst thou kill my cousin?


259
0:17:46,998 --> 0:18:17,137
Capulet! To the prince!


260
0:18:17,137 --> 0:18:24,146
Speak, Benvolio, speak!


261
0:18:24,146 --> 0:18:26,149
Go on, speak.


262
0:18:26,149 --> 0:18:28,152
Prince!
As thou art true,


263
0:18:28,152 --> 0:18:33,592
for blood of ours
shed blood of Montague.


264
0:18:33,592 --> 0:18:36,596
Benvolio, who began
this bloody fray?


265
0:18:36,596 --> 0:18:38,232
Tybalt, here slain.


266
0:18:38,232 --> 0:18:40,1
No!


267
0:18:40,1 --> 0:18:43,605
Romeo did
speak him fair,


268
0:18:43,605 --> 0:18:46,609
bid him bethink how nice
the quarrel was,


269
0:18:46,609 --> 0:18:48,512
and urged withal
your high displeasure.


270
0:18:48,512 --> 0:18:49,913
It's true, Prince.


271
0:18:49,913 --> 0:18:51,616
The picture
makes him false.


272
0:18:51,616 --> 0:18:58,858
He speaks not true.


273
0:18:58,858 --> 0:19:0,36
I beg for justice,


274
0:19:0,36 --> 0:19:3,13
which thou,
Prince must give.


275
0:19:3,13 --> 0:19:10,873
Romeo slew Tybalt,
Romeo must not live.


276
0:19:10,873 --> 0:19:23,59
Romeo slew him.


277
0:19:23,59 --> 0:19:32,102
He slew Mercutio.


278
0:19:32,102 --> 0:19:40,612
Who now the price
of his dear blood doth owe?


279
0:19:40,612 --> 0:19:43,116
Not Romeo, Prince...


280
0:19:43,116 --> 0:19:45,619
He was Mercutio's friend.


281
0:19:45,619 --> 0:19:49,624
His fault concludes
but what the law should end.


282
0:19:49,624 --> 0:19:51,761
The life of Tybalt!


283
0:19:51,761 --> 0:19:53,162
And for that offense,


284
0:19:53,162 --> 0:19:56,633
immediately we do
exile him hence.


285
0:19:56,633 --> 0:20:0,138
Let Romeo
hence in haste,


286
0:20:0,138 --> 0:20:2,674
else, when he's found...


287
0:20:2,674 --> 0:20:20,597
That hour is his last.


288
0:20:20,597 --> 0:20:23,101
Ah, banishment...


289
0:20:23,101 --> 0:20:26,105
Be merciful, say death!


290
0:20:26,105 --> 0:20:28,275
Do not say banishment.


291
0:20:28,275 --> 0:20:29,609
Arise.


292
0:20:29,609 --> 0:20:32,613
One knocks;
good Romeo, hide thyself.


293
0:20:32,613 --> 0:20:35,117
Who's there?


294
0:20:35,117 --> 0:20:37,619
Who knocks so hard?


295
0:20:37,619 --> 0:20:40,123
Whence come you?


296
0:20:40,123 --> 0:20:41,625
What's your will?


297
0:20:41,625 --> 0:20:43,627
Let me come in,


298
0:20:43,627 --> 0:20:46,131
and you shall know
my errand.


299
0:20:46,131 --> 0:20:50,636
I come from
Lady Juliet.


300
0:20:50,636 --> 0:20:52,639
Welcome then.


301
0:20:52,639 --> 0:20:55,143
Holy friar,
o tell me, holy friar,


302
0:20:55,143 --> 0:20:57,145
where's my lady's lord,
where's Romeo?


303
0:20:57,145 --> 0:20:59,915
There, on the ground.


304
0:20:59,915 --> 0:21:1,417
With his own tears
made drunk.


305
0:21:1,417 --> 0:21:5,156
There is no world
without Verona walls.


306
0:21:5,156 --> 0:21:7,658
Even so lies she,


307
0:21:7,658 --> 0:21:9,161
blubbering and weeping,


308
0:21:9,161 --> 0:21:12,165
weeping and blubbering.


309
0:21:12,165 --> 0:21:13,666
Stand up!


310
0:21:13,666 --> 0:21:17,171
Stand and you
be a man.


311
0:21:17,171 --> 0:21:19,608
For Juliet's sake,
for her sake,


312
0:21:19,608 --> 0:21:21,109
rise and stand.


313
0:21:21,109 --> 0:21:24,614
Why should you fall
into so deep an 'ole?


314
0:21:24,614 --> 0:21:26,116
Nurse.


315
0:21:26,116 --> 0:21:29,12
Ah, sir, death's
the end of all.


316
0:21:29,12 --> 0:21:30,622
Speakst thou of Juliet?


317
0:21:30,622 --> 0:21:32,124
How is it with her?


318
0:21:32,124 --> 0:21:34,627
Does she not think
me an old murderer?


319
0:21:34,627 --> 0:21:37,13
Where is she?
How doth she?


320
0:21:37,13 --> 0:21:38,633
What says
my concealed lady


321
0:21:38,633 --> 0:21:40,134
to our canceled love?


322
0:21:40,134 --> 0:21:43,138
She says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps,


323
0:21:43,138 --> 0:21:45,375
and Tybalt calls,
and then on Romeo cries.


324
0:21:45,375 --> 0:21:48,378
As if that name
did murder her.


325
0:21:48,378 --> 0:21:51,148
O tell me, friar,
tell me,


326
0:21:51,148 --> 0:21:54,152
in what vile part
of this anatomy


327
0:21:54,152 --> 0:21:55,655
doth my name lodge?


328
0:21:55,655 --> 0:22:1,161
Tell me that I may sack
the hateful mansion!


329
0:22:1,161 --> 0:22:2,664
Hold thy
desperate hand.


330
0:22:2,664 --> 0:22:7,169
By heavens!
Leave it!


331
0:22:7,169 --> 0:22:9,673
Thou hast amazed me.


332
0:22:9,673 --> 0:22:11,675
Thou a man?


333
0:22:11,675 --> 0:22:14,178
Thy form
cries out thou art.


334
0:22:14,178 --> 0:22:16,181
Thy tears
are womanish,


335
0:22:16,181 --> 0:22:20,119
thy wild acts denote the
unreasonable fury of a beast.


336
0:22:20,119 --> 0:22:22,122
Hast thou slain Tybalt?


337
0:22:22,122 --> 0:22:24,625
Wilt thou slay thyself,
and slay thy lady,


338
0:22:24,625 --> 0:22:26,127
that in thy life lives,


339
0:22:26,127 --> 0:22:27,629
by doing damned hate
upon thyself?


340
0:22:27,629 --> 0:22:32,135
Rouse thee, man...


341
0:22:32,135 --> 0:22:33,637
Thy Juliet is alive.


342
0:22:33,637 --> 0:22:36,14
There art thou happy.


343
0:22:36,14 --> 0:22:37,642
Tybalt would kill thee,


344
0:22:37,642 --> 0:22:39,144
but thou slewest Tybalt;


345
0:22:39,144 --> 0:22:40,646
there art thou happy.


346
0:22:40,646 --> 0:22:43,65
The law that threatened death
becomes thy friend,


347
0:22:43,65 --> 0:22:45,553
and turns it to exile;


348
0:22:45,553 --> 0:22:47,54
there art thou happy.


349
0:22:47,54 --> 0:22:53,162
A pack of blessings
light upon thy back...


350
0:22:53,162 --> 0:22:57,167
Ascend her chamber,
hence and comfort her.


351
0:22:57,167 --> 0:23:0,672
But look thou stay
not till the watch be set,


352
0:23:0,672 --> 0:23:3,175
for then thou canst not
pass to Mantua,


353
0:23:3,175 --> 0:23:6,179
where thou shalt live
till we find a time


354
0:23:6,179 --> 0:23:8,682
to blaze your marriage,
reconcile your friends,


355
0:23:8,682 --> 0:23:11,686
beg pardon of the Prince,
and call thee home,


356
0:23:11,686 --> 0:23:14,69
with twenty hundred
thousand times more joy


357
0:23:14,69 --> 0:23:20,131
than thou wentest forth
in lamentation.


358
0:23:20,131 --> 0:23:21,632
Go before, nurse...


359
0:23:21,632 --> 0:23:23,135
Commend me to thy lady,


360
0:23:23,135 --> 0:23:26,139
and bid her hasten
all the house to bed,


361
0:23:26,139 --> 0:23:29,143
which heavy sorrow
makes them apt unto


362
0:23:29,143 --> 0:25:36,806
Romeo's coming.


363
0:25:36,806 --> 0:25:42,112
Wilt thou be gone?


364
0:25:42,112 --> 0:25:47,119
It is not yet
near day.


365
0:25:47,119 --> 0:25:50,123
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,


366
0:25:50,123 --> 0:25:55,129
that pierced the fearful hollow
of thine ear.


367
0:25:55,129 --> 0:25:58,233
Nightly she sings
on yond pomegranate tree.


368
0:25:58,233 --> 0:26:0,637
Oh, believe me, love,


369
0:26:0,637 --> 0:26:4,141
it was the nightingale.


370
0:26:4,141 --> 0:26:7,145
It was the lark...


371
0:26:7,145 --> 0:26:10,149
The herald of the morn,


372
0:26:10,149 --> 0:26:13,654
no nightingale.


373
0:26:13,654 --> 0:26:24,668
Night's candles
are burnt out...


374
0:26:24,668 --> 0:26:34,681
And jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountaintops.


375
0:26:34,681 --> 0:26:37,685
I must be gone and live,


376
0:26:37,685 --> 0:26:41,69
or stay and die.


377
0:26:41,69 --> 0:26:45,695
Yond light is not
daylight...


378
0:26:45,695 --> 0:26:51,202
I know it, I.


379
0:26:51,202 --> 0:26:53,539
Therefore stay yet,


380
0:26:53,539 --> 0:26:56,71
thou needst not
to be gone.


381
0:26:56,71 --> 0:26:58,211
Oh, let me be taken,


382
0:26:58,211 --> 0:27:0,715
let me be put to death.


383
0:27:0,715 --> 0:27:3,719
I am content so thou
wilt have it so.


384
0:27:3,719 --> 0:27:6,723
I'll say yon gray
is not the morning's eye,


385
0:27:6,723 --> 0:27:8,725
nor that is not
the lark


386
0:27:8,725 --> 0:27:11,228
whose notes do beat
the vaulty heavens


387
0:27:11,228 --> 0:27:12,563
so high above
our heads.


388
0:27:12,563 --> 0:27:17,737
I have more care
to stay than will to go.


389
0:27:17,737 --> 0:27:23,678
Come death, and welcome,
Juliet wills it so.


390
0:27:23,678 --> 0:27:26,18
It is...


391
0:27:26,18 --> 0:27:29,84
It is, hie hence,
be gone away.


392
0:27:29,84 --> 0:27:35,192
Romeo, it is.


393
0:27:35,192 --> 0:27:39,197
It is the lark that
sings so out of tune,


394
0:27:39,197 --> 0:27:43,704
straining harsh discords,
and unpleasing sharps.


395
0:27:43,704 --> 0:27:46,707
Some say the lark
makes sweet division;


396
0:27:46,707 --> 0:27:50,713
oh, this doth not so,
for she divideth us.


397
0:27:50,713 --> 0:27:52,214
So now be gone,


398
0:27:52,214 --> 0:27:54,384
more light and light
it grows.


399
0:27:54,384 --> 0:27:55,886
More light and light,


400
0:27:55,886 --> 0:28:2,795
more dark and dark
our woes.


401
0:28:2,795 --> 0:28:4,23
Madam!


402
0:28:4,23 --> 0:28:9,236
Your lady mother
comes to your chamber.


403
0:28:9,236 --> 0:28:10,739
Nurse.


404
0:28:10,739 --> 0:28:13,743
Your lady mother is
coming to your chamber.


405
0:28:13,743 --> 0:28:17,848
The day is broke,
look about.


406
0:28:17,848 --> 0:28:20,217
Oh, art thou gone so,


407
0:28:20,217 --> 0:28:21,686
my husband, friend?


408
0:28:21,686 --> 0:28:25,191
I must hear from thee
every day in the hour,


409
0:28:25,191 --> 0:28:27,694
for in a minute
there are many days,


410
0:28:27,694 --> 0:28:31,199
o by this count
I shall be much in years,


411
0:28:31,199 --> 0:28:33,201
ere I again behold my Romeo.


412
0:28:33,201 --> 0:28:35,204
I will omit
no opportunity


413
0:28:35,204 --> 0:28:40,21
that may convey
my greetings, love, to thee.


414
0:28:40,21 --> 0:28:44,716
Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?


415
0:28:44,716 --> 0:28:47,72
I doubt it not,


416
0:28:47,72 --> 0:28:50,223
and all these woes
shall serve


417
0:28:50,223 --> 0:28:55,73
for sweet discourses
in our time to come.


418
0:28:55,73 --> 0:28:59,735
Farewell, farewell,


419
0:28:59,735 --> 0:29:26,203
one kiss
and I'll descend.


420
0:29:26,203 --> 0:29:32,912
Adieu.


421
0:29:32,912 --> 0:29:40,721
Adieu!


422
0:29:40,721 --> 0:30:4,753
Oh, God!


423
0:30:4,753 --> 0:30:7,757
We will have vengeance
for it,


424
0:30:7,757 --> 0:30:9,259
fear thou not...


425
0:30:9,259 --> 0:30:11,762
No!


426
0:30:11,762 --> 0:30:19,272
Then weep no more.


427
0:30:19,272 --> 0:30:21,709
I'll send to one
in Mantua,


428
0:30:21,709 --> 0:30:24,713
where that same
banished runagate doth live


429
0:30:24,713 --> 0:30:29,218
shall give him such
an unaccustomed dram,


430
0:30:29,218 --> 0:30:32,222
that he shall soon
keep Tybalt company.


431
0:30:32,222 --> 0:30:34,726
No!


432
0:30:34,726 --> 0:30:38,731
But now I'll tell thee
joyful tidings, girl.


433
0:30:38,731 --> 0:30:42,235
Well, then thou hast
a careful father,


434
0:30:42,235 --> 0:30:45,239
one who to put thee
from thy heaviness


435
0:30:45,239 --> 0:30:49,745
hath sorted out
a sudden day of joy.


436
0:30:49,745 --> 0:30:53,249
And joy comes well
in such a needy time.


437
0:30:53,249 --> 0:30:56,253
Marry, my child,
early next Thursday morn,


438
0:30:56,253 --> 0:30:58,757
the gallant, young
and noble prince,


439
0:30:58,757 --> 0:31:1,761
the county Paris,
at St. Peter's church,


440
0:31:1,761 --> 0:31:6,266
shall happily make thee
there a joyful bride.


441
0:31:6,266 --> 0:31:10,271
Now by St. Peter's church,
and Peter too,


442
0:31:10,271 --> 0:31:14,778
he shall not make me there
a joyful bride!


443
0:31:14,778 --> 0:31:21,52
No! No!


444
0:31:21,52 --> 0:31:26,225
So, it is concluded.


445
0:31:26,225 --> 0:31:32,901
Son, Paris.


446
0:31:32,901 --> 0:31:37,73
How now, wife, have you
delivered to her our decree?


447
0:31:37,73 --> 0:31:39,776
Ay, sir,
but she will none,


448
0:31:39,776 --> 0:31:43,81
she gives you thanks.


449
0:31:43,81 --> 0:31:48,288
I would the fool were
married to her grave.


450
0:31:48,288 --> 0:31:54,295
Soft...
take me with you.


451
0:31:54,295 --> 0:31:56,798
Take me with you, wife.


452
0:31:56,798 --> 0:31:59,302
How? Will she none?


453
0:31:59,302 --> 0:32:1,805
Doth she not
give us thanks?


454
0:32:1,805 --> 0:32:4,308
Is she not proud?


455
0:32:4,308 --> 0:32:7,812
Doth she not count her blessed,
unworthy as she is,


456
0:32:7,812 --> 0:32:12,319
that we have wrought so worthy
a gentleman to be her bridegroom?


457
0:32:12,319 --> 0:32:14,922
Wretched fool!
Let me see her!


458
0:32:14,922 --> 0:32:16,324
Ungrateful baggage!


459
0:32:16,324 --> 0:32:19,762
Say what thou wilt,
thou shalt not house with me!


460
0:32:19,762 --> 0:32:21,497
Fie! What, are you mad?


461
0:32:21,497 --> 0:32:23,266
Hang thee,
young baggage!


462
0:32:23,266 --> 0:32:24,467
Disobedient wretch!


463
0:32:24,467 --> 0:32:27,772
I tell thee what,
get thee to church on Thursday,


464
0:32:27,772 --> 0:32:30,776
or never after
look me in the face.


465
0:32:30,776 --> 0:32:33,279
Oh, father, good father,
I beseech you.


466
0:32:33,279 --> 0:32:35,783
Speak not, reply not,
do not answer me.


467
0:32:35,783 --> 0:32:37,284
My fingers itch.


468
0:32:37,284 --> 0:32:40,288
You are to blame, my lord,
to rate her so.


469
0:32:40,288 --> 0:32:41,791
And why,
my lady wisdom?


470
0:32:41,791 --> 0:32:43,292
Hold your tongue!


471
0:32:43,292 --> 0:32:45,796
Good prudence, smatter
with your gossips, go!


472
0:32:45,796 --> 0:32:47,297
I speak no treason.


473
0:32:47,297 --> 0:32:48,8
May not one speak?


474
0:32:48,8 --> 0:32:50,301
Speak!
You mumbling fool!


475
0:32:50,301 --> 0:32:52,304
Utter your gravity
o'er a gossip's bowl,


476
0:32:52,304 --> 0:32:53,806
for here we need it not.


477
0:32:53,806 --> 0:32:56,81
You are too hot.


478
0:32:56,81 --> 0:33:2,818
God's bread,
it makes me mad.


479
0:33:2,818 --> 0:33:4,19
Thursday's near.


480
0:33:4,19 --> 0:33:6,322
Lay hand on heart, advise.


481
0:33:6,322 --> 0:33:9,393
An you be mine,
I give you to my friend;


482
0:33:9,393 --> 0:33:10,828
an you be not,


483
0:33:10,828 --> 0:33:13,665
hang, beg, starve,
die in the streets.


484
0:33:13,665 --> 0:33:14,833
No!


485
0:33:14,833 --> 0:33:17,436
For by my soul,
I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,


486
0:33:17,436 --> 0:33:20,507
for what is mine
shall never do thee good.


487
0:33:20,507 --> 0:33:21,775
Father!


488
0:33:21,775 --> 0:33:33,39
Trust to't, bethink you,
I'll not be forsworn.


489
0:33:33,39 --> 0:33:36,461
Oh, no! No!


490
0:33:36,461 --> 0:33:39,298
Oh sweet, my mother,
cast me not away.


491
0:33:39,298 --> 0:33:41,801
Delay this marriage
for a month, a week, oh!


492
0:33:41,801 --> 0:33:47,41
Talk not to me,
for I'll not speak a word.


493
0:33:47,41 --> 0:33:53,817
Do as thou wilt,
for I have done with thee.


494
0:33:53,817 --> 0:33:57,221
Oh, God!


495
0:33:57,221 --> 0:33:58,322
Oh, nurse?


496
0:33:58,322 --> 0:34:0,325
How shall this
be prevented?


497
0:34:0,325 --> 0:34:2,328
What sayest thou?


498
0:34:2,328 --> 0:34:5,331
Hast thou not
a word of joy?


499
0:34:5,331 --> 0:34:7,668
Some comfort, nurse.


500
0:34:7,668 --> 0:34:10,338
Faith, here it is.


501
0:34:10,338 --> 0:34:14,844
Romeo is banished...


502
0:34:14,844 --> 0:34:17,281
And all the world
to nothing,


503
0:34:17,281 --> 0:34:20,285
that he dares ne'er come back
to challenge you;


504
0:34:20,285 --> 0:34:24,29
or if he do, it needs must
be by stealth.


505
0:34:24,29 --> 0:34:28,796
Then since the case so stands
as now it doth,


506
0:34:28,796 --> 0:34:44,316
I think it best
you marry with the county.


507
0:34:44,316 --> 0:34:47,32
True.


508
0:34:47,32 --> 0:34:53,712
O he's a lovely
gentleman.


509
0:34:53,712 --> 0:34:58,218
Romeo's
a dishclout to him.


510
0:34:58,218 --> 0:35:1,222
An eagle, madam,
hath not so green,


511
0:35:1,222 --> 0:35:4,726
so quick, so fair an eye
as Paris hath.


512
0:35:4,726 --> 0:35:6,229
Beshrew my heart,


513
0:35:6,229 --> 0:35:9,733
I think you happy
in this second match.


514
0:35:9,733 --> 0:35:14,72
It excels your first.


515
0:35:14,72 --> 0:35:17,677
For if it did not,
your first is dead,


516
0:35:17,677 --> 0:35:20,681
or 'twere as good he were
as living here,


517
0:35:20,681 --> 0:35:23,685
and you no use of him.


518
0:35:23,685 --> 0:35:30,694
Speakest thou
from thy heart?


519
0:35:30,694 --> 0:35:35,199
And from my soul, too...


520
0:35:35,199 --> 0:35:37,202
Or else
beshrew them both.


521
0:35:37,202 --> 0:35:39,706
Amen.


522
0:35:39,706 --> 0:35:41,207
What?


523
0:35:41,207 --> 0:35:49,218
Well, thou hast comforted me
marvelous much.


524
0:35:49,218 --> 0:35:52,723
Go in, and tell my lady
I am gone,


525
0:35:52,723 --> 0:35:54,224
having displeased my father,


526
0:35:54,224 --> 0:35:56,227
to Laurence's cell,


527
0:35:56,227 --> 0:36:0,566
to make confession
and to be absolved.


528
0:36:0,566 --> 0:36:4,738
Marry, I shall,
and this is wisely done.


529
0:36:4,738 --> 0:36:36,118
Go!


530
0:36:36,118 --> 0:36:39,121
You say you do not know
the lady's mind.


531
0:36:39,121 --> 0:36:42,125
Uneven is the course,
I like it not.


532
0:36:42,125 --> 0:36:44,628
Immoderately she weeps
for Tybalt's death,


533
0:36:44,628 --> 0:36:47,132
and therefore have I
little talked of love,


534
0:36:47,132 --> 0:36:55,642
for Venus smiles not
in a house of tears.


535
0:36:55,642 --> 0:37:1,15
Oh!


536
0:37:1,15 --> 0:37:6,657
Happily met,
my lady and my wife.


537
0:37:6,657 --> 0:37:12,664
That may be, sir,
when I may be a wife.


538
0:37:12,664 --> 0:37:18,71
Come you to make
confession to this father?


539
0:37:18,71 --> 0:37:20,608
Are you at leisure,
holy father, now,


540
0:37:20,608 --> 0:37:23,445
or shall I come to you
at evening mass?


541
0:37:23,445 --> 0:37:25,781
My leisure serves me,
pensive daughter, now.


542
0:37:25,781 --> 0:37:28,351
My lord, we must entreat
the time alone.


543
0:37:28,351 --> 0:37:31,122
God shield I should
disturb devotion.


544
0:37:31,122 --> 0:37:36,128
Juliet, on Thursday early
will I rouse thee.


545
0:37:36,128 --> 0:37:40,634
Till then, adieu...


546
0:37:40,634 --> 0:37:51,648
and keep this holy kiss.


547
0:37:51,648 --> 0:37:55,52
Oh, shut the door,
and when thou hast done so,


548
0:37:55,52 --> 0:37:58,157
come weep with me,
past hope,


549
0:37:58,157 --> 0:38:11,674
past care, past help.


550
0:38:11,674 --> 0:38:14,678
Oh, Juliet, I already
know thy grief.


551
0:38:14,678 --> 0:38:17,616
Tell me not, Friar,
that thou heard'st of this,


552
0:38:17,616 --> 0:38:20,62
unless thou tell me
how I can prevent it.


553
0:38:20,62 --> 0:38:36,641
If in thy wisdom
thou cans't give no help...


554
0:38:36,641 --> 0:38:42,147
Hold, daughter.


555
0:38:42,147 --> 0:38:45,151
I do spy a kind of hope,


556
0:38:45,151 --> 0:38:50,659
as that is desperate
which we would prevent.


557
0:38:50,659 --> 0:38:53,729
If rather than to marry
county Paris,


558
0:38:53,729 --> 0:38:55,665
thou hast
the strength of will to--


559
0:38:55,665 --> 0:38:57,668
O bid me leap,
rather than marry Paris,


560
0:38:57,668 --> 0:38:59,169
from off the battlements
of any tower,


561
0:38:59,169 --> 0:39:1,5
or bid me go
into a new-made grave


562
0:39:1,5 --> 0:39:3,676
and hide me with a dead man
in his shroud.


563
0:39:3,676 --> 0:39:17,927
Hold then.


564
0:39:17,927 --> 0:39:20,631
Go home.


565
0:39:20,631 --> 0:39:24,869
Be merry.


566
0:39:24,869 --> 0:39:27,139
Give consent
to marry Paris.


567
0:39:27,139 --> 0:39:28,574
Oh, no.


568
0:39:28,574 --> 0:39:34,148
Wednesday is tomorrow.


569
0:39:34,148 --> 0:39:37,152
Tomorrow night
look that thou lie alone,


570
0:39:37,152 --> 0:39:49,167
let not the nurse
lie with thee in thy chamber.


571
0:39:49,167 --> 0:39:55,142
Take thou this phial,
being then in bed...


572
0:39:55,142 --> 0:40:3,987
And this distilling liquor
drink thou off...


573
0:40:3,987 --> 0:40:7,191
When presently through
all thy veins shall run


574
0:40:7,191 --> 0:40:10,154
a cold and drowsy humor;,


575
0:40:10,154 --> 0:40:14,627
for no pulse shall keep
his native progress,


576
0:40:14,627 --> 0:40:16,95
but surcease;


577
0:40:16,95 --> 0:40:25,574
no warmth, no breath
shall testify thou livest...


578
0:40:25,574 --> 0:40:28,645
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death


579
0:40:28,645 --> 0:40:40,594
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours...


580
0:40:40,594 --> 0:40:48,103
And then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.


581
0:40:48,103 --> 0:40:53,243
In the meantime,
against thou shalt awake


582
0:40:53,243 --> 0:40:56,614
shall Romeo by my letters
know our drift,


583
0:40:56,614 --> 0:40:58,617
and hither shall he come,


584
0:40:58,617 --> 0:41:1,12
and he and I
will watch thy waking,


585
0:41:1,12 --> 0:41:7,629
and that very night shall Romeo
bear thee hence to Mantua.


586
0:41:7,629 --> 0:41:9,303
Give me, give me!


587
0:41:9,303 --> 0:41:11,573
Tell me not of fear.


588
0:41:11,573 --> 0:41:22,86
Hold, then.


589
0:41:22,86 --> 0:41:23,588
Get thee gone.


590
0:41:23,588 --> 0:42:2,639
Be strong and prosperous
in this resolve.


591
0:42:2,639 --> 0:42:4,642
How now, my headstrong.


592
0:42:4,642 --> 0:42:6,644
Where have you
been gadding?


593
0:42:6,644 --> 0:42:8,647
Where I have learnt me


594
0:42:8,647 --> 0:42:13,152
to repent the sin
of disobedient opposition.


595
0:42:13,152 --> 0:42:15,155
Pardon me,
henceforward l,


596
0:42:15,155 --> 0:42:18,593
I am ever ruled by you.


597
0:42:18,593 --> 0:42:21,597
Why, I am glad on't!


598
0:42:21,597 --> 0:42:24,1
This is well.
Stand up.


599
0:42:24,1 --> 0:43:3,651
This is
as it should be.


600
0:43:3,651 --> 0:43:31,621
Love give me strength.


601
0:43:31,621 --> 0:43:34,624
Give this letter
into the hand of Romeo,


602
0:43:34,624 --> 0:44:10,738
in Mantua.


603
0:44:10,738 --> 0:44:12,674
Aah!


604
0:44:12,674 --> 0:44:14,176
My lord! My lord!


605
0:44:14,176 --> 0:44:17,981
She's dead,
Juliet is dead!


606
0:44:17,981 --> 0:44:20,851
My Lady Juliet, my lord.
She's dead, she's dead!


607
0:44:20,851 --> 0:44:22,621
Juliet!


608
0:44:22,621 --> 0:44:24,422
Juliet!


609
0:44:24,422 --> 0:44:26,425
Juliet!


610
0:44:26,425 --> 0:44:31,131
My baby,
where is she?


611
0:44:31,131 --> 0:44:35,137
O lamentable day.


612
0:44:35,137 --> 0:44:39,142
Death lies on her
like an untimely frost


613
0:44:39,142 --> 0:46:58,689
upon the sweetest flower
of all the field.


614
0:46:58,689 --> 0:47:0,459
Master.


615
0:47:0,459 --> 0:47:5,198
Balthasar!


616
0:47:5,198 --> 0:47:6,7
How fares my Juliet?


617
0:47:6,7 --> 0:47:9,971
For nothing can be ill,
if she be well.


618
0:47:9,971 --> 0:47:25,157
How fares my lady?


619
0:47:25,157 --> 0:47:27,127
She's dead, my lord.


620
0:47:27,127 --> 0:47:29,163
She's dead.


621
0:47:29,163 --> 0:47:32,166
Her body sleeps
in capel's monument.


622
0:47:32,166 --> 0:47:46,685
I saw her laid low
in her kindred's vault.


623
0:47:46,685 --> 0:49:14,659
Then, I defy you, stars!


624
0:49:14,659 --> 0:49:17,263
Live...


625
0:49:17,263 --> 0:49:20,601
and be prosperous.


626
0:49:20,601 --> 0:50:31,759
Farewell, good fellow.


627
0:50:31,759 --> 0:51:23,192
Juliet.


628
0:51:23,192 --> 0:51:29,701
O my love...


629
0:51:29,701 --> 0:51:33,707
My wife.


630
0:51:33,707 --> 0:51:37,712
Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath,


631
0:51:37,712 --> 0:51:45,722
hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.


632
0:51:45,722 --> 0:51:50,729
Thou art not conquered...


633
0:51:50,729 --> 0:51:55,735
Beauty's ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips


634
0:51:55,735 --> 0:51:59,907
and in thy cheeks.


635
0:51:59,907 --> 0:52:8,752
Death's pale flag
is not advanced there.


636
0:52:8,752 --> 0:52:16,261
Tybalt.


637
0:52:16,261 --> 0:52:30,413
Liest thou there
in thy bloody sheet?


638
0:52:30,413 --> 0:52:34,419
What more favor
can I do to thee,


639
0:52:34,419 --> 0:52:38,924
than with that hand
that cut thy youth in twain


640
0:52:38,924 --> 0:52:51,441
to sunder his
that was thine enemy?


641
0:52:51,441 --> 0:53:3,956
Forgive me, cousin.


642
0:53:3,956 --> 0:53:11,467
Ah, dear Juliet.


643
0:53:11,467 --> 0:53:16,473
Why art thou yet so fair?


644
0:53:16,473 --> 0:53:19,41
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous,


645
0:53:19,41 --> 0:53:21,914
and that the lean
abhorred monster


646
0:53:21,914 --> 0:53:25,218
keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?


647
0:53:25,218 --> 0:53:35,932
For fear of that,
I still will stay with thee.


648
0:53:35,932 --> 0:53:43,942
Never from this palace
of dim night depart again.


649
0:53:43,942 --> 0:53:49,449
Here, here will I remain,


650
0:53:49,449 --> 0:54:12,479
with worms that are
thy chambermaids.


651
0:54:12,479 --> 0:54:21,925
Eyes, look your last.


652
0:54:21,925 --> 0:54:28,433
Arms, take your last embrace.


653
0:54:28,433 --> 0:54:33,439
And lips,
o you the doors of breath,


654
0:54:33,439 --> 0:54:35,442
seal with a righteous kiss


655
0:54:35,442 --> 0:55:15,995
a dateless bargain
to engrossing death.


656
0:55:15,995 --> 0:55:46,468
Here's to my love.


657
0:55:46,468 --> 0:55:51,173
Thus with a kiss...


658
0:55:51,173 --> 0:56:6,494
I die.


659
0:56:6,494 --> 0:56:7,995
Who's there?


660
0:56:7,995 --> 0:56:11,5
A friend, and one
that knows thee well.


661
0:56:11,5 --> 0:56:14,504
Balthasar. How long
hast thou been here?


662
0:56:14,504 --> 0:56:16,6
Full half an hour.


663
0:56:16,6 --> 0:56:18,443
Go with me to the vault.


664
0:56:18,443 --> 0:56:19,945
I dare not, sir.


665
0:56:19,945 --> 0:56:22,949
My master knows not
that I am gone hence.


666
0:56:22,949 --> 0:56:27,454
Stay then,
I'll go alone.


667
0:56:27,454 --> 0:56:29,457
Fear comes upon me.


668
0:56:29,457 --> 0:57:11,511
O much I fear
some ill unlucky thing.


669
0:57:11,511 --> 0:57:23,961
Romeo!


670
0:57:23,961 --> 0:57:25,964
Oh, what an unkind hour


671
0:57:25,964 --> 0:58:13,25
is guilty of this
lamentable chance?


672
0:58:13,25 --> 0:58:21,969
Ohh!


673
0:58:21,969 --> 0:58:28,979
O comfortable Friar,
where is my lord?


674
0:58:28,979 --> 0:58:31,982
I do remember well
where I should be,


675
0:58:31,982 --> 0:58:33,985
and there I am.


676
0:58:33,985 --> 0:58:38,491
Where is my Romeo?


677
0:58:38,491 --> 0:58:40,494
I hear some noise.


678
0:58:40,494 --> 0:58:42,997
Oh, where is my Romeo?


679
0:58:42,997 --> 0:58:47,2
Oh, lady, come from this nest
of death, contagion,


680
0:58:47,2 --> 0:58:50,507
and unnatural sleep.


681
0:58:50,507 --> 0:58:53,511
A greater power
than we can contradict


682
0:58:53,511 --> 0:58:55,12
hath thwarted
our intents.


683
0:58:55,12 --> 0:58:57,516
Come along.
The watch is coming.


684
0:58:57,516 --> 0:59:6,27
Where is my Romeo?


685
0:59:6,27 --> 0:59:9,532
Come. Go, good Juliet.


686
0:59:9,532 --> 0:59:11,33
No.


687
0:59:11,33 --> 0:59:13,36
I dare no longer stay.


688
0:59:13,36 --> 0:59:14,538
No!


689
0:59:14,538 --> 0:59:17,408
I dare no longer stay.


690
0:59:17,408 --> 0:59:20,979
Juliet!


691
0:59:20,979 --> 0:59:23,483
I dare no longer stay.


692
0:59:23,483 --> 1:0:6,539
I dare
no longer stay!


693
1:0:6,539 --> 1:0:14,48
What's here?


694
1:0:14,48 --> 1:0:21,491
Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.


695
1:0:21,491 --> 1:0:23,494
O churl!


696
1:0:23,494 --> 1:0:26,498
Drunk all,
and left no friendly drop


697
1:0:26,498 --> 1:0:28,5
to help me after!


698
1:0:28,5 --> 1:0:30,503
I will kiss thy lips;


699
1:0:30,503 --> 1:0:33,507
haply some poison
yet doth hang on them


700
1:0:33,507 --> 1:0:42,18
to make me die
with a restorative.


701
1:0:42,18 --> 1:0:55,535
Thy lips are warm!


702
1:0:55,535 --> 1:1:9,53
Oh, no, no!


703
1:1:9,53 --> 1:1:11,56
Lead, boy, which way?


704
1:1:11,56 --> 1:1:12,957
Search about
the churchyard.


705
1:1:12,957 --> 1:1:14,56
Go, some of you...


706
1:1:14,56 --> 1:1:20,568
Yea, noise?


707
1:1:20,568 --> 1:1:26,75
No!


708
1:1:26,75 --> 1:1:33,84
Then I'll be brief,
o happy dagger!


709
1:1:33,84 --> 1:1:36,88
This is thy sheath;


710
1:1:36,88 --> 1:3:29,957
there rest and let me die.


711
1:3:29,957 --> 1:3:34,964
Where be these enemies?


712
1:3:34,964 --> 1:3:39,97
Capulet!


713
1:3:39,97 --> 1:3:49,483
Montague!


714
1:3:49,483 --> 1:3:54,99
See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate...


715
1:3:54,99 --> 1:4:0,163
that heaven finds means
to kill your joys with love;


716
1:4:0,163 --> 1:4:9,976
and l, for winking
at your discords too,


717
1:4:9,976 --> 1:4:17,18
have lost
a brace of kinsmen.


718
1:4:17,18 --> 1:4:24,962
All are punished.


719
1:4:24,962 --> 1:4:58,506
All are punished!


720
1:4:58,506 --> 1:5:3,512
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.


721
1:5:3,512 --> 1:5:9,19
The sun for sorrow
will not show his head,


722
1:5:9,19 --> 1:5:12,524
for never was a story
of more woe


723
1:5:12,524 --> 1:7:12,524
than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.
