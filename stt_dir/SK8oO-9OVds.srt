JOHN DURANT: Today I
wanted to talk about paleo


3
0:0:2,59 --> 0:0:7,95
as bio-hacking, which may be a
little bit different than how


4
0:0:7,95 --> 0:0:9,88
it's currently
portrayed in the press.


5
0:0:9,88 --> 0:0:13,49
A lot of the pieces on the paleo
diet, or the cave man diet,


6
0:0:13,49 --> 0:0:17,5
in the press are a
little bit cartoonish.


7
0:0:17,5 --> 0:0:20,6
I'm a little bit
responsible for that.


8
0:0:20,6 --> 0:0:25,26
But it often gets portrayed as
the macho man eating raw meats


9
0:0:25,26 --> 0:0:26,9
straight off the
bone wearing a loin


10
0:0:26,9 --> 0:0:30,11
cloth, which is pretty silly.


11
0:0:30,11 --> 0:0:33,38
But that's sort of the way
that a lot of journalists


12
0:0:33,38 --> 0:0:35,1
portray it.


13
0:0:35,1 --> 0:0:37,84
My book, and this approach,
is actually about something


14
0:0:37,84 --> 0:0:41,53
much bigger than paleo or
the paleolithic or even just


15
0:0:41,53 --> 0:0:45,43
diet, which is starting to take
evolution, human evolution,


16
0:0:45,43 --> 0:0:49,39
seriously when we think
about human health.


17
0:0:49,39 --> 0:0:53,6
The current state of
health recommendations


18
0:0:53,6 --> 0:0:57,45
in this country and
the world is awful.


19
0:0:57,45 --> 0:1:0,37
So many people
want to be healthy,


20
0:1:0,37 --> 0:1:3,202
but are confused by
conflicting advice.


21
0:1:3,202 --> 0:1:4,41
You know, should I do Atkins?


22
0:1:4,41 --> 0:1:6,28
Should I go vegetarian?


23
0:1:6,28 --> 0:1:11,12
Health issues, ethical
issues, environmental issues.


24
0:1:11,12 --> 0:1:15,25
For weight loss or
autoimmune conditions?


25
0:1:15,25 --> 0:1:16,31
Should I count calories?


26
0:1:16,31 --> 0:1:17,18
Is fat evil?


27
0:1:17,18 --> 0:1:19,54
Are there types of
fat that aren't evil?


28
0:1:19,54 --> 0:1:21,3
There's a lot of mass
confusion out there.


29
0:1:21,3 --> 0:1:25,21
And there are a lot of eating
disorders, clearly obesity,


30
0:1:25,21 --> 0:1:26,56
type 2 diabetes.


31
0:1:26,56 --> 0:1:30,22
People are living a long
time, but the question is,


32
0:1:30,22 --> 0:1:32,58
are they thriving
and being healthy?


33
0:1:32,58 --> 0:1:35,0
So the broader concept that
I want to talk about today


34
0:1:35,0 --> 0:1:38,6
isn't just diet or isn't
just the paleolithic,


35
0:1:38,6 --> 0:1:43,11
but starting to use
our evolutionary past


36
0:1:43,11 --> 0:1:46,76
to generate really smart
heuristics that are probably


37
0:1:46,76 --> 0:1:50,43
pretty close to being right
in pretty short order.


38
0:1:50,43 --> 0:1:57,3



39
0:1:57,3 --> 0:1:59,87
I'm sure you guys are very
familiar with some principles


40
0:1:59,87 --> 0:2:2,56
of hacking or bio-hacking.


41
0:2:2,56 --> 0:2:5,71
And I just sort of want to do
a comparison between principals


42
0:2:5,71 --> 0:2:10,53
of hacking or bio-hacking,
and what this broader paleo


43
0:2:10,53 --> 0:2:13,23
sphere is doing in
the health world.


44
0:2:13,23 --> 0:2:15,35
So trial-and-error
is very important--


45
0:2:15,35 --> 0:2:18,65
hands-on, do-it-yourself,
self-experimentation, n equals


46
0:2:18,65 --> 0:2:21,53
1, experiments.


47
0:2:21,53 --> 0:2:26,6
And speed-- move fast.


48
0:2:26,6 --> 0:2:27,87
Embrace failure-- break things.


49
0:2:27,87 --> 0:2:32,54
80% solutions--
don't let the perfect


50
0:2:32,54 --> 0:2:34,53
be the enemy of the good.


51
0:2:34,53 --> 0:2:39,19
Resourcefulness--
repurposing old features


52
0:2:39,19 --> 0:2:42,414
for new uses,
accidental discoveries.


53
0:2:42,414 --> 0:2:43,83
I'm moving very
quickly over these


54
0:2:43,83 --> 0:2:45,704
because I feel like this
audience is probably


55
0:2:45,704 --> 0:2:48,36
very familiar with
this type of stuff.


56
0:2:48,36 --> 0:2:50,57
Simplicity-- keep
it simple stupid.


57
0:2:50,57 --> 0:2:51,93
Decentralization.


58
0:2:51,93 --> 0:2:53,44
All these hacking principles.


59
0:2:53,44 --> 0:2:55,44
What's also cool
about these principles


60
0:2:55,44 --> 0:2:59,46
is it's actually have evolution
by natural selection works.


61
0:2:59,46 --> 0:3:2,88
It's an amateurish
process without


62
0:3:2,88 --> 0:3:6,36
any overarching authority.


63
0:3:6,36 --> 0:3:9,81
It isn't concerned with theory.


64
0:3:9,81 --> 0:3:12,57
Organisms are always
using whatever


65
0:3:12,57 --> 0:3:18,43
a bits are lying around as
material for new functions


66
0:3:18,43 --> 0:3:20,17
and features.


67
0:3:20,17 --> 0:3:24,8
It's sort of a blind,
trial-and-error search process.


68
0:3:24,8 --> 0:3:29,35



69
0:3:29,35 --> 0:3:33,48
So when you actually look at
this broader paleo movement,


70
0:3:33,48 --> 0:3:34,98
whether you call it that word.


71
0:3:34,98 --> 0:3:37,42
Maybe another word is
better-- ancestral health,


72
0:3:37,42 --> 0:3:40,9
evolutionary health,
evolutionary medicine.


73
0:3:40,9 --> 0:3:43,58
Again, you have a lot
of similar features.


74
0:3:43,58 --> 0:3:46,23
You basically have a lot
of amateurs out there


75
0:3:46,23 --> 0:3:49,52
who have said a lot
of the top-down advice


76
0:3:49,52 --> 0:3:52,57
that we're getting from
health officials at the USDA


77
0:3:52,57 --> 0:3:56,98
or in the government or my
corporate health program


78
0:3:56,98 --> 0:4:2,9
or my health insurance policy
don't seem to be working.


79
0:4:2,9 --> 0:4:6,78
And so maybe it's time to
start treating your own health


80
0:4:6,78 --> 0:4:9,95
as a do-it-yourself activity.


81
0:4:9,95 --> 0:4:11,47
Because if you want to prevent
chronic health conditions,


82
0:4:11,47 --> 0:4:13,23
there's no magic
pill you can take.


83
0:4:13,23 --> 0:4:15,59
There's no surgery
that you can conduct


84
0:4:15,59 --> 0:4:19,709
to prevent the onset of
obesity and type 2 diabetes


85
0:4:19,709 --> 0:4:21,39
and Alzheimer's and
things like that.


86
0:4:21,39 --> 0:4:24,7
You actually have to take
day-to-day in your daily life


87
0:4:24,7 --> 0:4:26,38
to prevent all these things.


88
0:4:26,38 --> 0:4:29,28
So in a sense, we're
all bio-hackers


89
0:4:29,28 --> 0:4:30,65
if we want to be healthy.


90
0:4:30,65 --> 0:4:32,29
We have to do it yourself.


91
0:4:32,29 --> 0:4:35,26



92
0:4:35,26 --> 0:4:40,4
Over the last few years,
this sort of paleo approach


93
0:4:40,4 --> 0:4:45,74
has been pounding the pavement
on things like saturated fat.


94
0:4:45,74 --> 0:4:47,67
And that a lot of the
science on saturated fat


95
0:4:47,67 --> 0:4:53,68
has been distorted,
or poorly conducted,


96
0:4:53,68 --> 0:4:58,81
publishing biases to make
saturated fat look bad.


97
0:4:58,81 --> 0:5:1,97
But over the last couple
years of iteration of people


98
0:5:1,97 --> 0:5:4,49
experimenting with
their own blood work,


99
0:5:4,49 --> 0:5:8,38
with different levels of
saturated fat in their diet,


100
0:5:8,38 --> 0:5:10,84
people have very
quickly realized,


101
0:5:10,84 --> 0:5:13,77
wait a second, saturated
fat is not this evil thing.


102
0:5:13,77 --> 0:5:17,5
40% of all fats in human
breast milk or saturated.


103
0:5:17,5 --> 0:5:20,46
About 40% of all the fats in
the human body are saturated.


104
0:5:20,46 --> 0:5:23,4
We've had saturated fat in
our diet for millions of years


105
0:5:23,4 --> 0:5:25,16
from bone marrow and brains.


106
0:5:25,16 --> 0:5:30,68
So our metabolism is
well-adapted to metabolizing,


107
0:5:30,68 --> 0:5:34,44
to harnessing it as
an energy source.


108
0:5:34,44 --> 0:5:37,0
So you see issues
like that where


109
0:5:37,0 --> 0:5:40,41
this bottom-up, open source
community is moving much faster


110
0:5:40,41 --> 0:5:44,43
than the conventional
health authorities.


111
0:5:44,43 --> 0:5:47,17
Embracing failure.


112
0:5:47,17 --> 0:5:51,34
There are folks in
the paleosphere who


113
0:5:51,34 --> 0:5:54,64
get into fights about
whether eating a legume


114
0:5:54,64 --> 0:5:57,73
is going to kill you or not,
or give you kidney stones.


115
0:5:57,73 --> 0:6:0,21
Or rice or wheat.


116
0:6:0,21 --> 0:6:4,16
A lot of people are
talking about gluten-free.


117
0:6:4,16 --> 0:6:10,27
Is having a little bit of gluten
going to cause stomach problems


118
0:6:10,27 --> 0:6:12,9
and digestive
problems in any one?


119
0:6:12,9 --> 0:6:13,21
Is this overblown?


120
0:6:13,21 --> 0:6:16,5
So there may be some areas
where this burgeoning


121
0:6:16,5 --> 0:6:17,68
movement is wrong.


122
0:6:17,68 --> 0:6:18,987
That's OK.


123
0:6:18,987 --> 0:6:19,945
People are moving fast.


124
0:6:19,945 --> 0:6:20,96
They're experimenting.


125
0:6:20,96 --> 0:6:23,92
And they're going to see
whether it works or not.


126
0:6:23,92 --> 0:6:26,3
We don't have to go through
all the rest of these.


127
0:6:26,3 --> 0:6:27,83



128
0:6:27,83 --> 0:6:30,85
So much my book actually isn't
mostly about the paleolithic,


129
0:6:30,85 --> 0:6:32,35
even though it uses
the word paleo.


130
0:6:32,35 --> 0:6:35,37
And so I want to
introduce the structure


131
0:6:35,37 --> 0:6:41,15
that I use to think about human
evolution and any health issue


132
0:6:41,15 --> 0:6:43,65
that you want to deal with--
not just food, not just


133
0:6:43,65 --> 0:6:44,8
movement or anything.


134
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:51,2
So this is a typical
singularity chart from Kurzweil


135
0:6:51,2 --> 0:6:56,36
from life to today, the
growth of complexity


136
0:6:56,36 --> 0:7:1,95
or major transitions
over that period of time.


137
0:7:1,95 --> 0:7:3,9
And so I sort of
structure my thinking


138
0:7:3,9 --> 0:7:6,39
into five main
buckets, as we think


139
0:7:6,39 --> 0:7:10,3
about human evolution from the
beginning of life to today.


140
0:7:10,3 --> 0:7:12,44
What I call the Animal
Age, or basically


141
0:7:12,44 --> 0:7:17,62
from the Cambrian explosion to
the beginning the Paleolithic,


142
0:7:17,62 --> 0:7:20,24
pre-human essentially.


143
0:7:20,24 --> 0:7:25,4
We can learn a lot from other
species and our common ancestry


144
0:7:25,4 --> 0:7:29,0
with other species about how to
be healthy, whether it's food,


145
0:7:29,0 --> 0:7:29,875
whether its movement.


146
0:7:29,875 --> 0:7:32,46



147
0:7:32,46 --> 0:7:35,59
Then you get the Paleolithic
for about 2.6 million years.


148
0:7:35,59 --> 0:7:42,17
That's when you get hominids
and humans emerging.


149
0:7:42,17 --> 0:7:44,73
Then you get the
Agricultural Age.


150
0:7:44,73 --> 0:7:46,23
After the agricultural
revolution,


151
0:7:46,23 --> 0:7:48,6
we domesticate
plants and animals,


152
0:7:48,6 --> 0:7:50,33
start living in cities.


153
0:7:50,33 --> 0:7:52,8
Our lifestyles
change dramatically.


154
0:7:52,8 --> 0:7:54,23
The industrial age.


155
0:7:54,23 --> 0:7:55,71
And the information age.


156
0:7:55,71 --> 0:8:3,83
And we can use this simple
five-age, five-era framework


157
0:8:3,83 --> 0:8:9,477
to in really quick fashion get
a handle, 80% of the way there


158
0:8:9,477 --> 0:8:10,81
on pretty much any health issue.


159
0:8:10,81 --> 0:8:13,34



160
0:8:13,34 --> 0:8:17,3
And start to cut through
a lot of noise that's


161
0:8:17,3 --> 0:8:20,1
out there about
how to be healthy.


162
0:8:20,1 --> 0:8:22,68
Should we eat saturated fat?


163
0:8:22,68 --> 0:8:24,201
How much sun exposure
should we get?


164
0:8:24,201 --> 0:8:25,2
How much should we move?


165
0:8:25,2 --> 0:8:27,55
And in what ways are the
best ways to exercise?


166
0:8:27,55 --> 0:8:31,41
And all of these questions
that just fill the bookstores


167
0:8:31,41 --> 0:8:34,59
with diet books and health
books and all this nuttiness.


168
0:8:34,59 --> 0:8:36,48
It doesn't have to
be this complicated.


169
0:8:36,48 --> 0:8:40,22
So some of the
heuristics that we


170
0:8:40,22 --> 0:8:41,96
can learn when we
look at other species


171
0:8:41,96 --> 0:8:46,7
is any health dynamic you care
about-- thermal regulation,


172
0:8:46,7 --> 0:8:51,79
diet, movement,
anything-- the best way


173
0:8:51,79 --> 0:8:54,51
to learn about it is to
completely forget human beings


174
0:8:54,51 --> 0:8:55,9
and just look at other species.


175
0:8:55,9 --> 0:8:59,64
And compare that dynamic
across different species.


176
0:8:59,64 --> 0:9:2,6
Because as soon as you
start talking about humans,


177
0:9:2,6 --> 0:9:7,55
everybody has preconceived
notions about how to do it.


178
0:9:7,55 --> 0:9:9,62
People have a lot of--
particularly in food,


179
0:9:9,62 --> 0:9:13,29
food is like religion-- people
have all these identity--


180
0:9:13,29 --> 0:9:15,45
it's a source of identity
for a lot of people.


181
0:9:15,45 --> 0:9:18,33
And so you can't have an honest
conversation about what should


182
0:9:18,33 --> 0:9:21,11
I eat or what should I not eat?


183
0:9:21,11 --> 0:9:26,45
So if you look at our common
ancestry with other species,


184
0:9:26,45 --> 0:9:30,2
you can be like, OK, well
there are herbivores.


185
0:9:30,2 --> 0:9:31,68
There are carnivores.


186
0:9:31,68 --> 0:9:32,93
There are omnivores.


187
0:9:32,93 --> 0:9:35,43
And if you go to a
zoo, the basic approach


188
0:9:35,43 --> 0:9:37,55
that the top zoos
in the world take,


189
0:9:37,55 --> 0:9:40,71
is they use modern science
and medical technology


190
0:9:40,71 --> 0:9:42,2
to keep the animals alive.


191
0:9:42,2 --> 0:9:44,62
But then they mimic the
natural habitat and lifestyle


192
0:9:44,62 --> 0:9:49,62
of the species in relevant
ways, in the most relevant ways.


193
0:9:49,62 --> 0:9:52,93
And so it just depends
on the species.


194
0:9:52,93 --> 0:9:55,5
You want to feed red
meat and whole prey


195
0:9:55,5 --> 0:9:58,5
feeding to the lions
and the carnivores.


196
0:9:58,5 --> 0:10:1,2
And you want to feed
grass to the herbivores,


197
0:10:1,2 --> 0:10:3,94
or whatever plant species
they're adapted to.


198
0:10:3,94 --> 0:10:8,16
And omnivores have more
dietary flexibility.


199
0:10:8,16 --> 0:10:14,27
Immediately you can start to
realize that, first of all,


200
0:10:14,27 --> 0:10:16,91
there's no particular food
out there that is necessarily


201
0:10:16,91 --> 0:10:19,87
inherently unhealthy.


202
0:10:19,87 --> 0:10:25,16
It depends on whether that
species is adapted to it.


203
0:10:25,16 --> 0:10:28,47
Plenty of species are
adapted to eating grass.


204
0:10:28,47 --> 0:10:33,8
And they have the microorganisms
in their extensive stomach


205
0:10:33,8 --> 0:10:35,28
to digest it all.


206
0:10:35,28 --> 0:10:38,43
We don't.


207
0:10:38,43 --> 0:10:43,59
A second thing that you can
learn very quickly about health


208
0:10:43,59 --> 0:10:46,49
from looking at other
species-- and again looking


209
0:10:46,49 --> 0:10:49,58
at zoos, because that's
where we often have the best


210
0:10:49,58 --> 0:10:53,2
access to them-- is the
importance of habitat.


211
0:10:53,2 --> 0:10:55,15
And starting to
think about health


212
0:10:55,15 --> 0:10:57,88
in terms of a
holistic habitat-based


213
0:10:57,88 --> 0:10:59,99
approach to keeping
species healthy.


214
0:10:59,99 --> 0:11:3,44



215
0:11:3,44 --> 0:11:6,91
I talk about, in my book,
a trip to the Cleveland zoo


216
0:11:6,91 --> 0:11:10,75
where they had some
obese gorillas.


217
0:11:10,75 --> 0:11:13,62



218
0:11:13,62 --> 0:11:16,4
Heart disease and heart failure
is the number one killer


219
0:11:16,4 --> 0:11:19,95
of male gorillas in captivity,
just like heart disease


220
0:11:19,95 --> 0:11:25,2
is the number one killer of
male humans in civilization.


221
0:11:25,2 --> 0:11:26,76
And so they were
trying to figure out


222
0:11:26,76 --> 0:11:31,7
ways to reverse or halt the
progression of heart disease


223
0:11:31,7 --> 0:11:33,58
in these Western
lowland gorillas.


224
0:11:33,58 --> 0:11:35,99
And it's kind of like,
OK, so what should we do?


225
0:11:35,99 --> 0:11:38,47
They don't really have
any fat in their diet,


226
0:11:38,47 --> 0:11:41,23
so low-fat doesn't work.


227
0:11:41,23 --> 0:11:43,76
I guess what they could try
to restrict their calories,


228
0:11:43,76 --> 0:11:46,94
but that didn't
seem to make sense.


229
0:11:46,94 --> 0:11:49,45
So what they did was they
were like, oh wait a second,


230
0:11:49,45 --> 0:11:52,52
maybe we shouldn't be feeding
these Western lowland gorillas


231
0:11:52,52 --> 0:11:56,61
wheat, corn, and soy-based
fiber bars that are essentially


232
0:11:56,61 --> 0:11:58,86
reformulated dog food.


233
0:11:58,86 --> 0:12:0,26
Of course it's
not even dog food,


234
0:12:0,26 --> 0:12:3,48
because that's not what
dogs and wolves eat.


235
0:12:3,48 --> 0:12:6,0



236
0:12:6,0 --> 0:12:11,19
So they switched the gorillas
to a bunch of leafy plants


237
0:12:11,19 --> 0:12:14,16
and vegetables that they bought
in the local Cleveland grocery


238
0:12:14,16 --> 0:12:15,11
store.


239
0:12:15,11 --> 0:12:16,92
McCullough lost 70 pounds.


240
0:12:16,92 --> 0:12:19,28
Beback lost 35 pounds.


241
0:12:19,28 --> 0:12:20,56
Their blood work improved.


242
0:12:20,56 --> 0:12:23,16
Behavioral problems went away.


243
0:12:23,16 --> 0:12:26,7
All sorts of things like that.


244
0:12:26,7 --> 0:12:30,676
But all of these zoos
realized that you


245
0:12:30,676 --> 0:12:32,5
can use modern
medical technology


246
0:12:32,5 --> 0:12:35,3
to keep the animals alive
for a long period of time,


247
0:12:35,3 --> 0:12:38,26
but if you want to prevent
the onset of chronic health


248
0:12:38,26 --> 0:12:41,34
conditions to help
them thrive, you


249
0:12:41,34 --> 0:12:43,0
have to take a
habitat-based approach.


250
0:12:43,0 --> 0:12:45,2
Because there's no
pill, there's no surgery


251
0:12:45,2 --> 0:12:48,35
that can be done to
reverse these conditions,


252
0:12:48,35 --> 0:12:50,91
or at least not
terribly effectively.


253
0:12:50,91 --> 0:12:54,23
So that gives you your
first-pass approach at, OK,


254
0:12:54,23 --> 0:12:55,89
how does this dynamic work?


255
0:12:55,89 --> 0:12:57,51
Forget human beings.


256
0:12:57,51 --> 0:13:0,27
Then the next step
is to say, OK well,


257
0:13:0,27 --> 0:13:4,47
if we're talking
about diet, now how


258
0:13:4,47 --> 0:13:8,34
does this feature
manifest in human beings


259
0:13:8,34 --> 0:13:12,98
during a long formative
period in human evolution?


260
0:13:12,98 --> 0:13:16,79
During the paleolithic, this
2.6 million year period.


261
0:13:16,79 --> 0:13:19,31
It's not the end of the story.


262
0:13:19,31 --> 0:13:22,83
But it really is sort of
the beginning of the story.


263
0:13:22,83 --> 0:13:27,37
I don't think that paleo diets,
and paleo this and paleo that


264
0:13:27,37 --> 0:13:29,49
is the end of the conversation.


265
0:13:29,49 --> 0:13:32,4
It's more like it's the
appropriate beginning


266
0:13:32,4 --> 0:13:34,12
of the conversation.


267
0:13:34,12 --> 0:13:40,11
So if you were talking about
diet, that's where you realize,


268
0:13:40,11 --> 0:13:41,98
you talk to paleo
anthropologists


269
0:13:41,98 --> 0:13:44,13
and realize that
humans have been eating


270
0:13:44,13 --> 0:13:47,5
meat for 2.6 million
years or longer.


271
0:13:47,5 --> 0:13:49,36
There are cut marks
on bones that we


272
0:13:49,36 --> 0:13:51,72
have going back that long.


273
0:13:51,72 --> 0:13:55,97
And so right off the bat,
you're just immediately


274
0:13:55,97 --> 0:14:0,1
skeptical of claims that
veganism or vegetarianism are


275
0:14:0,1 --> 0:14:2,73
the optimal ways for humans
to be healthy because it's


276
0:14:2,73 --> 0:14:4,69
like, wait a second,
we've been omnivores


277
0:14:4,69 --> 0:14:6,81
for millions of years.


278
0:14:6,81 --> 0:14:10,51
There are no known vegan
or vegetarian indigenous


279
0:14:10,51 --> 0:14:13,5
populations.


280
0:14:13,5 --> 0:14:16,81
And the introduction of
meat into the human diet


281
0:14:16,81 --> 0:14:22,15
is, does appear, to
be related, in part,


282
0:14:22,15 --> 0:14:25,49
to the expansion of our brains.


283
0:14:25,49 --> 0:14:29,0
And so the paleolithic gives you
this first-pass approximation


284
0:14:29,0 --> 0:14:34,19
of what might be a healthy
lifestyle, healthy diet,


285
0:14:34,19 --> 0:14:39,571
temperature changes, circadian
rhythms, sleep patterns, all


286
0:14:39,571 --> 0:14:40,7
of this.


287
0:14:40,7 --> 0:14:42,41
It gives you a
first-pass approximation


288
0:14:42,41 --> 0:14:46,56
of what might be a healthy
pattern for human beings today.


289
0:14:46,56 --> 0:14:48,84
It doesn't guarantee
that there aren't


290
0:14:48,84 --> 0:14:50,73
new ways of doing
things that are better,


291
0:14:50,73 --> 0:14:53,74
new foods that might
be healthier or better.


292
0:14:53,74 --> 0:14:57,82
But for the amateur
trying to quickly arrive


293
0:14:57,82 --> 0:15:1,92
at good heuristics, it's
the right place to start.


294
0:15:1,92 --> 0:15:4,14
Then after the
agricultural revolution,


295
0:15:4,14 --> 0:15:5,77
people start living in cities.


296
0:15:5,77 --> 0:15:8,42
We become farmers
and herders instead


297
0:15:8,42 --> 0:15:11,7
of hunters and gatherers.


298
0:15:11,7 --> 0:15:15,7
And so, then you take into
account recent adaptations.


299
0:15:15,7 --> 0:15:18,5
So just because a
food is novel doesn't


300
0:15:18,5 --> 0:15:22,13
mean it's bad or unhealthy.


301
0:15:22,13 --> 0:15:27,25
So, for example, most
people's favorite foods


302
0:15:27,25 --> 0:15:32,56
come from fermentation, whether
it's alcohol or cheese or bread


303
0:15:32,56 --> 0:15:37,14
or a lot of things the
harness microorganisms


304
0:15:37,14 --> 0:15:39,59
and the process of
fermentation to be created.


305
0:15:39,59 --> 0:15:43,4
So we can take into account
recent cultural adaptations.


306
0:15:43,4 --> 0:15:47,35
We can also take into
account genetic adaptations.


307
0:15:47,35 --> 0:15:49,97
You look at alcohol,
and populations


308
0:15:49,97 --> 0:15:53,71
that have been drinking
alcohol for 5,000 years


309
0:15:53,71 --> 0:15:56,45
handle it better than
indigenous populations that


310
0:15:56,45 --> 0:16:1,5
have been drinking alcohol
for three generations.


311
0:16:1,5 --> 0:16:7,4
They're just not adapted to
metabolizing alcohol well.


312
0:16:7,4 --> 0:16:13,6
If you come from European
or Middle Eastern ancestry,


313
0:16:13,6 --> 0:16:16,4
our ancestors went
through a process


314
0:16:16,4 --> 0:16:19,84
where there were probably lots
of people dying of alcoholism.


315
0:16:19,84 --> 0:16:23,8
But it happened 5,000 years ago.


316
0:16:23,8 --> 0:16:26,98
And I won't go too
much into this,


317
0:16:26,98 --> 0:16:29,21
but one of the heuristics
that's very important


318
0:16:29,21 --> 0:16:31,93
is realizing the
importance of culture,


319
0:16:31,93 --> 0:16:34,87
both culture in the forms
of ideas and microbes


320
0:16:34,87 --> 0:16:37,19
to human health.


321
0:16:37,19 --> 0:16:39,4
So then you get
the Industrial Age.


322
0:16:39,4 --> 0:16:42,23
And the Industrial Age and
the Industrial Revolution


323
0:16:42,23 --> 0:16:43,68
over the last
couple hundred years


324
0:16:43,68 --> 0:16:46,79
is pretty much a warning
of what not to do.


325
0:16:46,79 --> 0:16:48,35
This is the simple heuristic.


326
0:16:48,35 --> 0:16:51,71



327
0:16:51,71 --> 0:16:55,11
The British Navy sends a
bunch of sailors out on ships.


328
0:16:55,11 --> 0:16:58,49
And they alter their food
so that it doesn't perish,


329
0:16:58,49 --> 0:17:1,62
and don't realize that these
guys are going to get scurvy


330
0:17:1,62 --> 0:17:5,839
because there's no Vitamin
C in what they're eating.


331
0:17:5,839 --> 0:17:9,74
Or people move indoors and
they don't get any sunlight.


332
0:17:9,74 --> 0:17:11,89
And then people get rickets.


333
0:17:11,89 --> 0:17:16,27
So we started changing
things in human lives


334
0:17:16,27 --> 0:17:18,819
so quickly during the
Industrial Revolution


335
0:17:18,819 --> 0:17:23,349
that we weren't able to adapt
culturally or genetically.


336
0:17:23,349 --> 0:17:30,4
Rickets, pellagra,
scurvy, even explorers


337
0:17:30,4 --> 0:17:32,65
going in novel habitats
during the Industrial


338
0:17:32,65 --> 0:17:38,23
Age, a flight going undersea.


339
0:17:38,23 --> 0:17:40,4
This industrial
technology was literally


340
0:17:40,4 --> 0:17:42,62
pushing human beings in
habitats that we had never


341
0:17:42,62 --> 0:17:49,46
experienced over eons of
genetic and cultural evolution.


342
0:17:49,46 --> 0:17:52,85
And we learned how
to kill ourselves.


343
0:17:52,85 --> 0:17:55,51
We killed ourselves at the
beginning of the Industrial


344
0:17:55,51 --> 0:18:0,3
Revolution through lack of
sun exposure and rickets,


345
0:18:0,3 --> 0:18:4,28
through missing micronutrients,
changing our diet so quickly


346
0:18:4,28 --> 0:18:7,55
and shifting to a diet of
refined flour and sugar


347
0:18:7,55 --> 0:18:10,27
and alcohol that we were
missing key micronutrients


348
0:18:10,27 --> 0:18:11,21
from our diet.


349
0:18:11,21 --> 0:18:13,57
And then by the end
of the Industrial Age,


350
0:18:13,57 --> 0:18:17,31
we figure out that we need
to add certain things back in


351
0:18:17,31 --> 0:18:18,83
and fortified foods with them.


352
0:18:18,83 --> 0:18:21,53
But we were just solving
problems of our own creation.


353
0:18:21,53 --> 0:18:23,29
So the big lesson from
the Industrial Age


354
0:18:23,29 --> 0:18:25,5
is learning how to
not die basically.


355
0:18:25,5 --> 0:18:28,25



356
0:18:28,25 --> 0:18:31,34
And then today in
the Information Age


357
0:18:31,34 --> 0:18:35,81
we're now in a position
to-- the last piece of this


358
0:18:35,81 --> 0:18:39,8
is personal experimentation and
customizing solutions to you.


359
0:18:39,8 --> 0:18:42,89



360
0:18:42,89 --> 0:18:47,48
Because everybody has a unique
genome, unique gut bacteria,


361
0:18:47,48 --> 0:18:51,36
allergies, injuries, tastes,
preferences, budgets,


362
0:18:51,36 --> 0:18:53,2
so we're all unique organisms.


363
0:18:53,2 --> 0:18:54,74
We all live in a unique habitat.


364
0:18:54,74 --> 0:18:57,34
We're all going to end up
with somewhat unique diets


365
0:18:57,34 --> 0:18:59,28
or lifestyles that work for us.


366
0:18:59,28 --> 0:19:2,21
So let's take food.


367
0:19:2,21 --> 0:19:4,29
A lot of people that hear
about the paleo diet,


368
0:19:4,29 --> 0:19:6,29
they just think of
the paleolithic.


369
0:19:6,29 --> 0:19:12,996
And the basic
prescriptions are--


370
0:19:12,996 --> 0:19:15,12
all the conventional health
authorities pretty much


371
0:19:15,12 --> 0:19:18,39
agree that too much industrial
foods is bad for you.


372
0:19:18,39 --> 0:19:22,21
So all their advice,
from the Mayo Clinic


373
0:19:22,21 --> 0:19:25,25
to Doctor Oz to Michael
Pollan to everybody


374
0:19:25,25 --> 0:19:28,41
is basically avoid
industrial food.


375
0:19:28,41 --> 0:19:32,43
Processed food--
Twinkies and Coca-Cola


376
0:19:32,43 --> 0:19:35,7
and refined sugar and all that.


377
0:19:35,7 --> 0:19:38,4
So it basically
boils down to, eat


378
0:19:38,4 --> 0:19:40,76
like we did before the
Industrial Revolution.


379
0:19:40,76 --> 0:19:43,3
Eat like you sort of
grew up on a farm.


380
0:19:43,3 --> 0:19:49,5
You had whole grain bread and
milk and cheese and organic.


381
0:19:49,5 --> 0:19:51,46
Everything was organic.


382
0:19:51,46 --> 0:19:52,706
We were still poor.


383
0:19:52,706 --> 0:19:53,83
But everything was organic.


384
0:19:53,83 --> 0:19:56,43



385
0:19:56,43 --> 0:19:58,49
So all of that health
advice basically


386
0:19:58,49 --> 0:20:0,149
boils down to eat like a farmer.


387
0:20:0,149 --> 0:20:1,19
Eat like a herder-farmer.


388
0:20:1,19 --> 0:20:4,36



389
0:20:4,36 --> 0:20:7,59
And that may be enough
for a lot of people.


390
0:20:7,59 --> 0:20:11,11
Avoiding industrial food for
a lot of people, particularly


391
0:20:11,11 --> 0:20:16,33
young people, may be
completely fine and sufficient.


392
0:20:16,33 --> 0:20:18,71
But it's not for a
lot of other folks.


393
0:20:18,71 --> 0:20:21,9
And so what paleo adds
to the mix is saying,


394
0:20:21,9 --> 0:20:25,28
OK well, the Agricultural
Revolution introduced


395
0:20:25,28 --> 0:20:27,66
two huge food groups
into the human diet


396
0:20:27,66 --> 0:20:29,87
they basically
hadn't been consumed


397
0:20:29,87 --> 0:20:36,67
before-- grains and legumes
and domesticated seeds,


398
0:20:36,67 --> 0:20:40,47
basically, and dairy from
domesticated animals.


399
0:20:40,47 --> 0:20:44,9
I don't know if anybody here
has milked a wild animal.


400
0:20:44,9 --> 0:20:44,85
It's not easy.


401
0:20:44,85 --> 0:20:48,26
It's possible, not easy.


402
0:20:48,26 --> 0:20:52,7
So what this adds, a
little more perspective,


403
0:20:52,7 --> 0:20:58,25
and says OK, well people
four hundred generations ago,


404
0:20:58,25 --> 0:21:1,88
only started to eat
tons of wheat and corn


405
0:21:1,88 --> 0:21:6,53
and diets shifted from
being very diverse,


406
0:21:6,53 --> 0:21:8,15
lots of different
animal species,


407
0:21:8,15 --> 0:21:9,93
lots of different
parts of the animal,


408
0:21:9,93 --> 0:21:12,31
lots of different types
of plants depending


409
0:21:12,31 --> 0:21:17,34
on the geography and the season,
to a diet heavily concentrated


410
0:21:17,34 --> 0:21:23,37
in a few staple cereal crops--
wheat, corn, barley, oats.


411
0:21:23,37 --> 0:21:26,47
And then products made from
that, bread and beer and things


412
0:21:26,47 --> 0:21:27,34
like.


413
0:21:27,34 --> 0:21:38,39
So paleo adds that piece
to the puzzle in food.


414
0:21:38,39 --> 0:21:42,31
So what I recommend
people do is-- first off,


415
0:21:42,31 --> 0:21:45,14
if you feel fine with
your health and the way


416
0:21:45,14 --> 0:21:50,4
that you're eating, there may
be no reason to change anything.


417
0:21:50,4 --> 0:21:55,3
If you feel fine and there
aren't any issues, then


418
0:21:55,3 --> 0:21:57,27
what's the problem?


419
0:21:57,27 --> 0:22:1,58
However, if eating
an agricultural diet


420
0:22:1,58 --> 0:22:5,19
isn't working for you, then
what you might want to explore


421
0:22:5,19 --> 0:22:9,89
is diets that were more common
during this prior period


422
0:22:9,89 --> 0:22:13,41
in human evolution-- so
removing grains, removing dairy


423
0:22:13,41 --> 0:22:18,77
for a time, and trying to mimic
an approximation-- we realize


424
0:22:18,77 --> 0:22:20,98
it's an approximation.


425
0:22:20,98 --> 0:22:24,46
And then add back in
novel modern foods


426
0:22:24,46 --> 0:22:26,17
and see how you feel.


427
0:22:26,17 --> 0:22:31,62
I know many people who are very
strict on gluten and grains.


428
0:22:31,62 --> 0:22:33,78
Many have to be.


429
0:22:33,78 --> 0:22:36,68
Many just want to be.


430
0:22:36,68 --> 0:22:41,64
And I know more people
who are flex on dairy,


431
0:22:41,64 --> 0:22:42,48
and when they eat
it it'll be more


432
0:22:42,48 --> 0:22:45,58
like full-fat traditional dairy.


433
0:22:45,58 --> 0:22:48,642
And then just see how you feel.


434
0:22:48,642 --> 0:22:50,6
And this is sort of the
bio-hacking part of it.


435
0:22:50,6 --> 0:22:52,48
You've got to experiment.


436
0:22:52,48 --> 0:22:55,81
And based on your ancestry
and your genome and your gut


437
0:22:55,81 --> 0:22:57,84
bacteria and what
you like, you just


438
0:22:57,84 --> 0:23:0,38
have to craft your own diet.


439
0:23:0,38 --> 0:23:2,805



440
0:23:2,805 --> 0:23:4,18
Let me give you
one more example,


441
0:23:4,18 --> 0:23:5,922
and then maybe we
can go to questions.


442
0:23:5,922 --> 0:23:7,13
I don't know what time it is.


443
0:23:7,13 --> 0:23:7,97
AUDIENCE: It's about 3:30.


444
0:23:7,97 --> 0:23:8,72
JOHN DURANT: 3:30?


445
0:23:8,72 --> 0:23:10,93



446
0:23:10,93 --> 0:23:14,67
The paleolithic doesn't
help you with all areas.


447
0:23:14,67 --> 0:23:17,26
And this is why I get a little
frustrated with the term paleo,


448
0:23:17,26 --> 0:23:19,38
even though I use
it and promote it.


449
0:23:19,38 --> 0:23:23,51
So take sleep, as an example.


450
0:23:23,51 --> 0:23:26,44
The big change in
human sleep patterns


451
0:23:26,44 --> 0:23:28,34
didn't happen between
the paleolithic


452
0:23:28,34 --> 0:23:30,8
and the agricultural revolution.


453
0:23:30,8 --> 0:23:34,39
People still lived with
their extended family


454
0:23:34,39 --> 0:23:40,6
in fairly close quarters and had
no indoor lighting and things


455
0:23:40,6 --> 0:23:41,27
like that.


456
0:23:41,27 --> 0:23:44,62
The big transition in sleep was
between the Agricultural Age


457
0:23:44,62 --> 0:23:48,8
and the Industrial Age when
you get indoor lighting,


458
0:23:48,8 --> 0:23:52,265
you get more stimulants
like coffee and tea


459
0:23:52,265 --> 0:23:55,71
to keep people up,
more alco-- well


460
0:23:55,71 --> 0:24:2,53
I guess alcohol was way before--
clocks, things like that.


461
0:24:2,53 --> 0:24:5,75
And then people increasingly
sleeping in isolation


462
0:24:5,75 --> 0:24:10,28
from others, in their own rooms,
on softer and softer bedding.


463
0:24:10,28 --> 0:24:14,13
So most of the big
key transition,


464
0:24:14,13 --> 0:24:17,544
most of the key changes,
when it comes to sleep,


465
0:24:17,544 --> 0:24:19,21
have nothing to do
with the paleolithic.


466
0:24:19,21 --> 0:24:21,68
And you can actually
get an approximation


467
0:24:21,68 --> 0:24:25,15
of a healthy way of
sleeping and sleep patterns


468
0:24:25,15 --> 0:24:27,805
from looking at our
agricultural era ancestors.


469
0:24:27,805 --> 0:24:30,43



470
0:24:30,43 --> 0:24:33,53
So the paleolithic
doesn't always


471
0:24:33,53 --> 0:24:35,37
hold the solutions
to everything.


472
0:24:35,37 --> 0:24:38,87



473
0:24:38,87 --> 0:24:41,34
We don't always need it,
depending on the issue.


474
0:24:41,34 --> 0:24:46,0
But people focus on
diet so much that that's


475
0:24:46,0 --> 0:24:48,56
what it gets associated with.


476
0:24:48,56 --> 0:24:51,39



477
0:24:51,39 --> 0:24:53,38
Do I have anything else?


478
0:24:53,38 --> 0:24:53,88
No.


479
0:24:53,88 --> 0:24:56,75
So if people now have
specific questions,


480
0:24:56,75 --> 0:24:58,715
let's open it up to questions.


481
0:24:58,715 --> 0:25:3,8
AUDIENCE: What do you mean
exactly by [INAUDIBLE]?


482
0:25:3,8 --> 0:25:3,955
JOHN DURANT: By what?


483
0:25:3,955 --> 0:25:6,78
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?


484
0:25:6,78 --> 0:25:14,78
JOHN DURANT: So people would
sleep near a fire, usually.


485
0:25:14,78 --> 0:25:16,59
There were lots
of people around.


486
0:25:16,59 --> 0:25:19,45
There wasn't very much privacy.


487
0:25:19,45 --> 0:25:21,32
There are a lot
of folks who think


488
0:25:21,32 --> 0:25:27,24
that sleep was less less of a
single uninterrupted stretch


489
0:25:27,24 --> 0:25:30,61
of seven or eight hours and
more broken up into two periods.


490
0:25:30,61 --> 0:25:33,35
Or you'd sleep for a
while, wake up, have sex,


491
0:25:33,35 --> 0:25:36,89
go to the bathroom, chat
with someone by the fire,


492
0:25:36,89 --> 0:25:39,59
go back to sleep
for a few hours.


493
0:25:39,59 --> 0:25:41,75
Night was a long time.


494
0:25:41,75 --> 0:25:45,3
And you couldn't do
much when it was dark.


495
0:25:45,3 --> 0:25:47,93
So that's sort of
what it was like.


496
0:25:47,93 --> 0:25:52,16
But it didn't change too much
when people started farming.


497
0:25:52,16 --> 0:25:54,2
And then they were
living in little huts


498
0:25:54,2 --> 0:25:57,87
with extended family
scrunched together


499
0:25:57,87 --> 0:26:0,87
around the fire for all night.


500
0:26:0,87 --> 0:26:5,55



501
0:26:5,55 --> 0:26:8,48
Other questions?


502
0:26:8,48 --> 0:26:10,65
AUDIENCE: From on VC behind you.


503
0:26:10,65 --> 0:26:12,41
You can't see me
actually, I think.


504
0:26:12,41 --> 0:26:13,76
JOHN DURANT: Hi.


505
0:26:13,76 --> 0:26:15,606



506
0:26:15,606 --> 0:26:17,71
AUDIENCE: When I was at
[INAUDIBLE] from Hamburg,


507
0:26:17,71 --> 0:26:19,64
Germany.


508
0:26:19,64 --> 0:26:22,7
And thanks again
for doing all this.


509
0:26:22,7 --> 0:26:23,975
Paleo has done a lot for me.


510
0:26:23,975 --> 0:26:26,1
Listened to you recently
on Robb Wolf again.


511
0:26:26,1 --> 0:26:28,397
It's just amazing stuff
that you guys are doing.


512
0:26:28,397 --> 0:26:29,23
JOHN DURANT: Thanks.


513
0:26:29,23 --> 0:26:34,262
AUDIENCE: So my question
is-- so [INAUDIBLE]


514
0:26:34,262 --> 0:26:35,97
a lot of people around
you there as well.


515
0:26:35,97 --> 0:26:37,511
I have a lot of
people, when you say,


516
0:26:37,511 --> 0:26:39,855
you know when people say they
are fine with what they're


517
0:26:39,855 --> 0:26:43,54
eating and they way they're
feeling, then [INAUDIBLE].


518
0:26:43,54 --> 0:26:48,17
So the two questions that I have
around that is, you know, A,


519
0:26:48,17 --> 0:26:49,89
how do they know
that they couldn't


520
0:26:49,89 --> 0:26:51,71
feel much, much better, right?


521
0:26:51,71 --> 0:26:53,76
I feel like we've been
doing that sort of stuff


522
0:26:53,76 --> 0:26:54,426
for a long time.


523
0:26:54,426 --> 0:26:55,68
We don't even know.


524
0:26:55,68 --> 0:26:57,6
[INAUDIBLE]?


525
0:26:57,6 --> 0:26:58,68
JOHN DURANT: Right.


526
0:26:58,68 --> 0:27:0,304
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] basically.


527
0:27:0,304 --> 0:27:0,97
All their lives.


528
0:27:0,97 --> 0:27:2,23
So, that's the one question.


529
0:27:2,23 --> 0:27:6,3
The other one is, I
feel like-- so you


530
0:27:6,3 --> 0:27:8,4
say a lot of young
people especially,


531
0:27:8,4 --> 0:27:10,43
I think what you mean is
that a lot of people, their


532
0:27:10,43 --> 0:27:13,69
their metabolism is much more
forgiving than, for example,


533
0:27:13,69 --> 0:27:14,51
later in time.


534
0:27:14,51 --> 0:27:15,0
JOHN DURANT: Right.


535
0:27:15,0 --> 0:27:16,416
AUDIENCE: What is
[INAUDIBLE] that


536
0:27:16,416 --> 0:27:20,678
is accumulating over this
period that sort of, you know,


537
0:27:20,678 --> 0:27:23,38
lifestyle, that
could be prevented,


538
0:27:23,38 --> 0:27:27,7
and would not even lead to
issues in the 30s, 40s, 50s,


539
0:27:27,7 --> 0:27:28,99
whenever.


540
0:27:28,99 --> 0:27:31,31
JOHN DURANT: So, thanks
for your questions.


541
0:27:31,31 --> 0:27:33,72
For the first
question, yeah, people


542
0:27:33,72 --> 0:27:39,66
tend to accept their
lives as normal.


543
0:27:39,66 --> 0:27:42,19
They confuse the word
normal with common.


544
0:27:42,19 --> 0:27:42,69
I do it.


545
0:27:42,69 --> 0:27:43,73
Everybody here does it.


546
0:27:43,73 --> 0:27:46,82
Just because it's
common in North America


547
0:27:46,82 --> 0:27:48,49
to live a certain
way doesn't mean


548
0:27:48,49 --> 0:27:55,98
it's necessarily species
typical in a biological sense.


549
0:27:55,98 --> 0:27:59,24
So they have the
same problem in zoos.


550
0:27:59,24 --> 0:28:2,88
They run studies on the health
of all the captive gorillas


551
0:28:2,88 --> 0:28:4,28
in North American zoos.


552
0:28:4,28 --> 0:28:6,82
But they actually can't conclude
very much because they all


553
0:28:6,82 --> 0:28:10,6
lead very similar lives and
very similar circumstances,


554
0:28:10,6 --> 0:28:12,34
eating very similar food.


555
0:28:12,34 --> 0:28:15,14
And so if you actually want to
see real differences in gorilla


556
0:28:15,14 --> 0:28:18,9
help, you have to compare them
with their wild counterparts.


557
0:28:18,9 --> 0:28:23,68
But the reason why I say,
however you're eating,


558
0:28:23,68 --> 0:28:25,68
if you feel great, fine
is partly because I


559
0:28:25,68 --> 0:28:29,13
don't want to push
people too much.


560
0:28:29,13 --> 0:28:32,72
And we can eat novel foods,
and we can live in new ways


561
0:28:32,72 --> 0:28:33,8
and that's fine.


562
0:28:33,8 --> 0:28:38,55
So I'm just trying to do more
of the soft sell, I guess.


563
0:28:38,55 --> 0:28:41,97
But I think people
would be surprised


564
0:28:41,97 --> 0:28:50,41
about how many conditions
they accept as normal that


565
0:28:50,41 --> 0:28:53,12
don't necessarily have to be.


566
0:28:53,12 --> 0:28:57,43
You get teenagers that
accept it as normal


567
0:28:57,43 --> 0:29:1,74
that they will need braces
and to get tons of acne.


568
0:29:1,74 --> 0:29:5,64
And this causes like a
lot of social anxiety,


569
0:29:5,64 --> 0:29:7,91
and like self-esteem issues.


570
0:29:7,91 --> 0:29:12,9
And we treat it as this
normal rite of passage


571
0:29:12,9 --> 0:29:15,34
through adolescence.


572
0:29:15,34 --> 0:29:18,32
But the reason why
our teeth are crowded


573
0:29:18,32 --> 0:29:21,89
is because our jaws
have gotten smaller


574
0:29:21,89 --> 0:29:24,96
over the last some thousands of
years because the food we eat


575
0:29:24,96 --> 0:29:26,15
isn't very tough.


576
0:29:26,15 --> 0:29:27,45
It's very soft.


577
0:29:27,45 --> 0:29:30,11
And so our jaws
don't grow as large


578
0:29:30,11 --> 0:29:33,96
as they do when we
had tougher foods.


579
0:29:33,96 --> 0:29:38,61
And so our jaws aren't large
enough to fit all of our teeth.


580
0:29:38,61 --> 0:29:42,11
And some of those
strong bite forces


581
0:29:42,11 --> 0:29:45,48
are what the body uses to help
your teeth come in straight.


582
0:29:45,48 --> 0:29:47,45
When you look at these
hunter gatherer skulls--


583
0:29:47,45 --> 0:29:50,69
and I've gotten to examine some
of them-- 80,000 years ago,


584
0:29:50,69 --> 0:29:51,9
beautiful set of teeth.


585
0:29:51,9 --> 0:29:54,182
Not perfect, but
wisdom teeth came in,


586
0:29:54,182 --> 0:29:56,39
there was enough room in
the jaw for the wisdom teeth


587
0:29:56,39 --> 0:29:57,53
to come in.


588
0:29:57,53 --> 0:29:59,73
No cavities.


589
0:29:59,73 --> 0:30:0,45
And straight.


590
0:30:0,45 --> 0:30:2,495
So that's--


591
0:30:2,495 --> 0:30:3,328
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.


592
0:30:3,328 --> 0:30:6,817
Are you saying that's an
evolutionary change over 80,000


593
0:30:6,817 --> 0:30:8,805
years, or is that
a specific change


594
0:30:8,805 --> 0:30:11,29
over the lifetime because
an individual is chewing


595
0:30:11,29 --> 0:30:13,617
less, that their jaw grows less.


596
0:30:13,617 --> 0:30:15,53
JOHN DURANT: Individual
chewing less,


597
0:30:15,53 --> 0:30:18,84
though there are some
lines of evidence


598
0:30:18,84 --> 0:30:22,94
that maybe the human
had has actually


599
0:30:22,94 --> 0:30:25,8
gotten a little bit smaller
over the last 10,000 years.


600
0:30:25,8 --> 0:30:28,82
Our brains actually used
to be a little bit bigger


601
0:30:28,82 --> 0:30:31,4
than they are today.


602
0:30:31,4 --> 0:30:33,15
Near the end the paleolithic.


603
0:30:33,15 --> 0:30:36,55
I don't know what that means.


604
0:30:36,55 --> 0:30:42,27
Your second question was about--
what was your second question?


605
0:30:42,27 --> 0:30:45,74
Oh youth, youth.


606
0:30:45,74 --> 0:30:49,75
So definitely young
people can-- there's


607
0:30:49,75 --> 0:30:53,16
very interesting evolutionary--
the evolutionary biology


608
0:30:53,16 --> 0:30:55,26
of aging is a very
fascinating area.


609
0:30:55,26 --> 0:30:58,59
There's a guy named Michael
Rose at UC Irvine who's probably


610
0:30:58,59 --> 0:31:1,9
the preeminent
guy in this field.


611
0:31:1,9 --> 0:31:7,8
And a lot of people think of
aging as sort of simply just


612
0:31:7,8 --> 0:31:11,73
damage accumulating,
like a car rolls off


613
0:31:11,73 --> 0:31:20,105
the lot at wherever
they sell cars--


614
0:31:20,105 --> 0:31:20,98
AUDIENCE: Dealership.


615
0:31:20,98 --> 0:31:23,32
JOHN DURANT: --at a dealership.


616
0:31:23,32 --> 0:31:25,62
And then from then on
out, it sort of just


617
0:31:25,62 --> 0:31:27,76
accumulates damage.


618
0:31:27,76 --> 0:31:34,89
But during the period of time
before the typical first stage


619
0:31:34,89 --> 0:31:40,95
of reproduction, we've basically
evolved incredible repair


620
0:31:40,95 --> 0:31:42,55
mechanisms.


621
0:31:42,55 --> 0:31:48,4
So let me put it this way, if
you get a genetic defect that


622
0:31:48,4 --> 0:31:50,99
causes you to die when
you're four or five,


623
0:31:50,99 --> 0:31:54,94
your genes don't get passed on
to the next generation at all.


624
0:31:54,94 --> 0:31:56,64
Kaput.


625
0:31:56,64 --> 0:31:57,38
You're out.


626
0:31:57,38 --> 0:31:59,22
You're out of the gene pool.


627
0:31:59,22 --> 0:32:3,42
But if you get that same
genetic defect when you're 50,


628
0:32:3,42 --> 0:32:6,54
you still have time
to have offspring.


629
0:32:6,54 --> 0:32:10,37
So basically, depending
on the first typical age


630
0:32:10,37 --> 0:32:12,87
of reproduction of
a species, evolution


631
0:32:12,87 --> 0:32:17,14
selects for incredible
robust health.


632
0:32:17,14 --> 0:32:19,64
We grow stronger
as we get older.


633
0:32:19,64 --> 0:32:24,3
We become more robust
from birth to adolescence,


634
0:32:24,3 --> 0:32:26,7
and then we start to
accumulate damage.


635
0:32:26,7 --> 0:32:34,63
So young people are
actually pretty well adapted


636
0:32:34,63 --> 0:32:38,17
to some aspects of
an agricultural diet.


637
0:32:38,17 --> 0:32:40,19
Young people are
probably better adapted


638
0:32:40,19 --> 0:32:44,38
to some of those foods than
those same individuals later


639
0:32:44,38 --> 0:32:44,88
in life.


640
0:32:44,88 --> 0:32:47,3
It's a very
counter-intuitive concept.


641
0:32:47,3 --> 0:32:52,7
But there's been selection
pressures for young kids


642
0:32:52,7 --> 0:32:54,53
to be able to survive
on these diets,


643
0:32:54,53 --> 0:32:57,83
to make it to the age
at which they reproduce.


644
0:32:57,83 --> 0:33:0,95
There has not been the
same sort of selection,


645
0:33:0,95 --> 0:33:4,43
or as strong of selection,
for older people.


646
0:33:4,43 --> 0:33:7,22
So there are a lot of
people, for example,


647
0:33:7,22 --> 0:33:11,4
who end up getting
Celiac later in life.


648
0:33:11,4 --> 0:33:14,14
There was some traumatic
event, or childbirth,


649
0:33:14,14 --> 0:33:16,19
or just getting older.


650
0:33:16,19 --> 0:33:19,22
Either Celiac or not being
able to digest lactose.


651
0:33:19,22 --> 0:33:21,36
They become lactose
intolerant later in life.


652
0:33:21,36 --> 0:33:24,11
You start to notice
it among folks.


653
0:33:24,11 --> 0:33:28,4
My grandmother developed
Celiac late in life.


654
0:33:28,4 --> 0:33:31,77
And it's possible that for
some of these more novel foods,


655
0:33:31,77 --> 0:33:33,511
we're better
adapted to them when


656
0:33:33,511 --> 0:33:35,76
we're young and less adapted
to them when we're older.


657
0:33:35,76 --> 0:33:39,4
So it may become
more important to eat


658
0:33:39,4 --> 0:33:43,92
more of a paleolithic
diet the older you get.


659
0:33:43,92 --> 0:33:45,902
Some of that is hypothesis.


660
0:33:45,902 --> 0:33:48,36
AUDIENCE: Can I jump in on that
just really quickly, sorry.


661
0:33:48,36 --> 0:33:51,5
AUDIENCE: Well let-- OK.


662
0:33:51,5 --> 0:33:54,84
AUDIENCE: Just because
it's a very tangible thing.


663
0:33:54,84 --> 0:33:58,9
[INAUDIBLE] a lot of
money into keeping


664
0:33:58,9 --> 0:33:59,469
Googlers healthy, right?


665
0:33:59,469 --> 0:34:0,26
JOHN DURANT: Right.


666
0:34:0,26 --> 0:34:3,456
Like free M&Ms and
stuff like that?


667
0:34:3,456 --> 0:34:4,89
AUDIENCE: They've reduced those.


668
0:34:4,89 --> 0:34:9,699
AUDIENCE: And we get massages,
and adjustable tables and gyms


669
0:34:9,699 --> 0:34:11,55
and that sort of stuff.


670
0:34:11,55 --> 0:34:13,863
And we have a lot of people
that started around age, I


671
0:34:13,863 --> 0:34:15,84
don't know, 20, 25 here.


672
0:34:15,84 --> 0:34:17,92
And then as they
continue working here,


673
0:34:17,92 --> 0:34:19,61
they get out of
shape, but they think


674
0:34:19,61 --> 0:34:21,989
that's the natural
course of life basically.


675
0:34:21,989 --> 0:34:25,26
So what would you tell Google
as a company to say, hey, look,


676
0:34:25,26 --> 0:34:27,862
your people just don't have
to get sick and fat, right?


677
0:34:27,862 --> 0:34:29,406
[LAUGHTER]


678
0:34:29,406 --> 0:34:30,489
JOHN DURANT: That's right.


679
0:34:30,489 --> 0:34:33,34
Well, you could start
to model workplaces


680
0:34:33,34 --> 0:34:36,5
on little hunter
gatherer tribes.


681
0:34:36,5 --> 0:34:37,5
Less clothing and things like.


682
0:34:37,5 --> 0:34:41,0



683
0:34:41,0 --> 0:34:44,929
When you look at traditional
people, indigenous folks,


684
0:34:44,929 --> 0:34:49,19
living in traditional ways,
they have health problems


685
0:34:49,19 --> 0:34:50,9
of their own-- infant
mortality, things


686
0:34:50,9 --> 0:34:54,484
like that-- but they tend
to live into their 60s, 70s,


687
0:34:54,484 --> 0:34:58,11
and even the 80s in some
cases in robust health.


688
0:34:58,11 --> 0:35:2,85
The 70-year-olds, they're
not bed-ridden with arthritis


689
0:35:2,85 --> 0:35:4,16
and have Alzheimer's.


690
0:35:4,16 --> 0:35:8,24
There like carrying pails
of water into their 70s


691
0:35:8,24 --> 0:35:11,7
and hiking up hills
and things like that.


692
0:35:11,7 --> 0:35:14,97
And if you were a
hunter gatherer,


693
0:35:14,97 --> 0:35:18,39
you had to, at a minimum, be
able to move with your tribe


694
0:35:18,39 --> 0:35:20,92
whenever it migrated.


695
0:35:20,92 --> 0:35:28,67
And so it gives you a new
sense of what's normal.


696
0:35:28,67 --> 0:35:32,19
What I like about the way that
Google thinks about health


697
0:35:32,19 --> 0:35:35,53
is really thinking
about the habitat.


698
0:35:35,53 --> 0:35:40,59
Saying OK, your habitat has a
big influence on whether you


699
0:35:40,59 --> 0:35:41,76
eat something or don't.


700
0:35:41,76 --> 0:35:44,83
If we put a cover on it
and make it less visible,


701
0:35:44,83 --> 0:35:46,21
fewer people eat the candy.


702
0:35:46,21 --> 0:35:49,71
I think that's one of the
changes that happened here.


703
0:35:49,71 --> 0:35:55,7
And what's good about
re-engineering your habitat


704
0:35:55,7 --> 0:35:59,75
is it doesn't require as much
willpower and discipline.


705
0:35:59,75 --> 0:36:2,27
So many people, when
they get into dieting,


706
0:36:2,27 --> 0:36:4,43
they think they're
changing themselves.


707
0:36:4,43 --> 0:36:6,21
Like I have to change myself.


708
0:36:6,21 --> 0:36:7,8
And I have to become
a better person.


709
0:36:7,8 --> 0:36:10,6
And I'm going to do this through
willpower and discipline.


710
0:36:10,6 --> 0:36:13,89
And that's part of the reason
why everybody fails at it.


711
0:36:13,89 --> 0:36:18,24
Because you can't-- nobody
is perfectly disciplined over


712
0:36:18,24 --> 0:36:19,88
a long period of time.


713
0:36:19,88 --> 0:36:24,66
You have to find ways
of using discipline


714
0:36:24,66 --> 0:36:27,15
in a short period of time
to change your habitat


715
0:36:27,15 --> 0:36:28,89
so that it makes it
easy to be healthy


716
0:36:28,89 --> 0:36:31,23
even when you're
not disciplined.


717
0:36:31,23 --> 0:36:35,86
Or the way that you lead
your life, the food you eat


718
0:36:35,86 --> 0:36:40,8
and how you move, it has to be
meaningful to you in some way.


719
0:36:40,8 --> 0:36:43,14
Calories are not
meaningful to people.


720
0:36:43,14 --> 0:36:44,92
Most people are not
motivated by calories.


721
0:36:44,92 --> 0:36:51,36



722
0:36:51,36 --> 0:36:58,61
Going to hunt a wild animal
to bring back a lot of meat


723
0:36:58,61 --> 0:37:2,5
to try to impress the girl
in the tribe that you like,


724
0:37:2,5 --> 0:37:4,28
that motivated people.


725
0:37:4,28 --> 0:37:8,49
So you have to think about ways
to either change your habitat


726
0:37:8,49 --> 0:37:11,3
or make a healthy lifestyle
meaningful to people


727
0:37:11,3 --> 0:37:15,66
so that's it doesn't
require discipline.


728
0:37:15,66 --> 0:37:18,6
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
when you said


729
0:37:18,6 --> 0:37:21,54
there was a lot of danger in
doing agricultural industrial.


730
0:37:21,54 --> 0:37:25,18
And I'm asking but now I'm
five days in [INAUDIBLE] all


731
0:37:25,18 --> 0:37:28,702
the things that can
happen if you make


732
0:37:28,702 --> 0:37:31,393
a switch from the
Information Age,


733
0:37:31,393 --> 0:37:33,351
where I've been eating
processed foods, breads,


734
0:37:33,351 --> 0:37:35,286
but then I just stop.


735
0:37:35,286 --> 0:37:35,786
Right?


736
0:37:35,786 --> 0:37:38,708
And I just stop and
start eating meant


737
0:37:38,708 --> 0:37:40,169
and vegetables and some fruits.


738
0:37:40,169 --> 0:37:44,968
And are there dangers
going the other way?


739
0:37:44,968 --> 0:37:48,454
Like, I read [INAUDIBLE]
so there's obviously


740
0:37:48,454 --> 0:37:50,695
a lot of fear factors,
but like how real are they


741
0:37:50,695 --> 0:37:52,153
for doing an abrupt
change in diet?


742
0:37:52,153 --> 0:37:57,74



743
0:37:57,74 --> 0:37:58,49
JOHN DURANT: One
thing people will


744
0:37:58,49 --> 0:38:2,37
notice with abrupt changes
is particularly around sugar.


745
0:38:2,37 --> 0:38:4,57
People eat a lot of sugar today.


746
0:38:4,57 --> 0:38:7,72
And if you eat a lot of
sugar, and then you cut it out


747
0:38:7,72 --> 0:38:9,34
of your diet, you're
basically going


748
0:38:9,34 --> 0:38:12,79
through withdrawal of a drug.


749
0:38:12,79 --> 0:38:15,42
And it's not pleasant.


750
0:38:15,42 --> 0:38:17,73
Lightheadedness,
shaky hands, inability


751
0:38:17,73 --> 0:38:21,6
to concentrate, anxiety.


752
0:38:21,6 --> 0:38:23,88
So that can be difficult.


753
0:38:23,88 --> 0:38:27,31



754
0:38:27,31 --> 0:38:35,36
Unless somebody has some sort of
specific, severe health issue,


755
0:38:35,36 --> 0:38:39,75
I do tend to think that trying
to go more or less whole hog,


756
0:38:39,75 --> 0:38:44,9
for a short period of time,
is the best way to do it.


757
0:38:44,9 --> 0:38:48,81
And you just got a
monitor how you feel.


758
0:38:48,81 --> 0:38:50,7
You'll see better results.


759
0:38:50,7 --> 0:38:52,35
Or you'll have a
better validation


760
0:38:52,35 --> 0:38:53,65
of whatever results you get.


761
0:38:53,65 --> 0:38:58,76



762
0:38:58,76 --> 0:39:1,9
And you can harness that
period of discipline.


763
0:39:1,9 --> 0:39:3,4
A lot of people
can be disciplined


764
0:39:3,4 --> 0:39:4,95
for a week or two weeks.


765
0:39:4,95 --> 0:39:8,34
Few people can just be
disciplined for two years.


766
0:39:8,34 --> 0:39:11,8
So rather than trying to go
sort of 5p% for a long period


767
0:39:11,8 --> 0:39:14,97
of time, just going 100%.


768
0:39:14,97 --> 0:39:21,84
Other risks-- with diet I don't
think there are as many risks.


769
0:39:21,84 --> 0:39:24,3
With exercise, yeah.


770
0:39:24,3 --> 0:39:27,12
If people just like immediately
jump into a hard CrossFit


771
0:39:27,12 --> 0:39:29,75
workout without
learning Olympic lifts,


772
0:39:29,75 --> 0:39:30,83
you can injure your back.


773
0:39:30,83 --> 0:39:33,62



774
0:39:33,62 --> 0:39:38,12
But for most people, sugar is
the biggest immediate obstacle.


775
0:39:38,12 --> 0:39:41,686



776
0:39:41,686 --> 0:39:43,98
AUDIENCE: So I'm vegan.


777
0:39:43,98 --> 0:39:48,238
And I actually agree a lot
with the paleo mindset.


778
0:39:48,238 --> 0:39:50,5
I think there's a lot
more in common than--


779
0:39:50,5 --> 0:39:51,91
JOHN DURANT: I agree.


780
0:39:51,91 --> 0:39:53,846
AUDIENCE: --as far as focusing
on whole foods, et cetera.


781
0:39:53,846 --> 0:39:56,536



782
0:39:56,536 --> 0:39:59,43
And I think it gets overblown
in the media how much meat you


783
0:39:59,43 --> 0:40:0,418
do have to eat.


784
0:40:0,418 --> 0:40:2,394
I think too much is bad.


785
0:40:2,394 --> 0:40:4,864
I don't think
necessarily [INAUDIBLE]


786
0:40:4,864 --> 0:40:6,35
the only way to do things.


787
0:40:6,35 --> 0:40:8,414
So I was just
curious, kind of, I


788
0:40:8,414 --> 0:40:12,77
guess you thoughts on diet,
maybe your day-to-day diet.


789
0:40:12,77 --> 0:40:16,12
JOHN DURANT: Well let me talk
about the vegan/ paleo thing


790
0:40:16,12 --> 0:40:17,15
for a second.


791
0:40:17,15 --> 0:40:21,19
In the press, it's often
portrayed as polar opposites.


792
0:40:21,19 --> 0:40:23,95
I do tend to think of paleo and
vegan as more like yin yang.


793
0:40:23,95 --> 0:40:28,24



794
0:40:28,24 --> 0:40:32,252
I have no problem with
people eating however


795
0:40:32,252 --> 0:40:32,96
they want to eat.


796
0:40:32,96 --> 0:40:34,83
And I respect vegans
and vegetarians


797
0:40:34,83 --> 0:40:38,3
a lot for being
conscious eaters.


798
0:40:38,3 --> 0:40:41,83
Where it does grate on me a
little bit is if people then


799
0:40:41,83 --> 0:40:45,49
turn around and say, this
is an optimal human diet.


800
0:40:45,49 --> 0:40:50,78
That's where I become a bit
more combative and disagree.


801
0:40:50,78 --> 0:40:54,26



802
0:40:54,26 --> 0:40:55,8
And here's the thing.


803
0:40:55,8 --> 0:40:58,86
Any dietary approach--
Atkins, vegan, paleo,


804
0:40:58,86 --> 0:41:3,34
whatever-- that gets people
to eat less industrial food,


805
0:41:3,34 --> 0:41:5,11
is going to work to some extent.


806
0:41:5,11 --> 0:41:10,64
Less refined sugar, refined
flour, high fructose corn


807
0:41:10,64 --> 0:41:11,38
syrup.


808
0:41:11,38 --> 0:41:14,7
Any approach that gets
people to reduce that


809
0:41:14,7 --> 0:41:17,83
will have some success
at least for a time.


810
0:41:17,83 --> 0:41:21,41
And then, I have much more
in common with how vegans


811
0:41:21,41 --> 0:41:29,11
eat than probably the
average Western diet.


812
0:41:29,11 --> 0:41:30,22
What was the last piece?


813
0:41:30,22 --> 0:41:32,1
How do I eat on a daily basis?


814
0:41:32,1 --> 0:41:33,79
AUDIENCE: Yeah what's
your day-to-day?


815
0:41:33,79 --> 0:41:36,1
JOHN DURANT: I often
don't eat breakfast.


816
0:41:36,1 --> 0:41:39,69
I don't wake up terribly hungry.


817
0:41:39,69 --> 0:41:43,72
Sometimes, if I do have
breakfast, I'll have some eggs


818
0:41:43,72 --> 0:41:45,18
and spinach.


819
0:41:45,18 --> 0:41:47,71
Or I'll have a bowl of
heavy cream, because I


820
0:41:47,71 --> 0:41:54,13
eat some dairy, and a sliced
up banana, which is delicious.


821
0:41:54,13 --> 0:41:56,73
Lunch-- sushi.


822
0:41:56,73 --> 0:41:59,39
I don't worry about a little
bit of white rice or anything


823
0:41:59,39 --> 0:42:1,63
like that.


824
0:42:1,63 --> 0:42:6,51
Sushi, sashimi, Mongolian
barbecue, meat and vegetables,


825
0:42:6,51 --> 0:42:9,54
a Cobb salad,
something like that.


826
0:42:9,54 --> 0:42:13,36
And then dinner would be a
piece of fish, sweet potato,


827
0:42:13,36 --> 0:42:14,92
and a side salad.


828
0:42:14,92 --> 0:42:18,98
I mean, it's not that radical.


829
0:42:18,98 --> 0:42:23,17
But it is radical over
an extended period


830
0:42:23,17 --> 0:42:27,46
when you realize that
gluten and wheat and corn


831
0:42:27,46 --> 0:42:31,0
are in everything
in the grocery store


832
0:42:31,0 --> 0:42:34,16
except for a few things
around the outside.


833
0:42:34,16 --> 0:42:37,7
AUDIENCE: Question
from VC behind you.


834
0:42:37,7 --> 0:42:38,36
JOHN DURANT: Hi.


835
0:42:38,36 --> 0:42:40,26
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned white rice.


836
0:42:40,26 --> 0:42:43,41
And I eat white rice
myself because I think it


837
0:42:43,41 --> 0:42:47,64
doesn't-- at least it doesn't
feel as bad wheat does.


838
0:42:47,64 --> 0:42:51,345
So, and I also read some studies
saying that among grains,


839
0:42:51,345 --> 0:42:52,97
you might actually
be better off eating


840
0:42:52,97 --> 0:42:57,425
white rice than brown
rice even, in moderation.


841
0:42:57,425 --> 0:42:58,76
So thought on that.


842
0:42:58,76 --> 0:43:1,55
And I'm going to throw in
a second question, which


843
0:43:1,55 --> 0:43:8,166
is you mentioned metabolism as
the damage analogy for aging.


844
0:43:8,166 --> 0:43:12,539
So the simple logic is that
the faster your metabolism


845
0:43:12,539 --> 0:43:13,83
the faster you're going to age.


846
0:43:13,83 --> 0:43:15,935
But then again, I
find, for instance,


847
0:43:15,935 --> 0:43:19,435
if I sleep on a cold, hard bed,
I feel better in the morning,


848
0:43:19,435 --> 0:43:22,6
and logically I feel like that's
the better things to be doing.


849
0:43:22,6 --> 0:43:25,279
But then part of me is
thinking, isn't my body


850
0:43:25,279 --> 0:43:27,57
trying to burn more fuel to
stay warm during the night.


851
0:43:27,57 --> 0:43:30,89
So I don't know if you
have any thoughts on that.


852
0:43:30,89 --> 0:43:33,76
JOHN DURANT: Well,
on rice first.


853
0:43:33,76 --> 0:43:39,52
In my mental model of
grains, wheat is the worst.


854
0:43:39,52 --> 0:43:41,9
And rice is the least
worst, or the best.


855
0:43:41,9 --> 0:43:46,19



856
0:43:46,19 --> 0:43:49,38
Let me give you the
10,000 foot view seeds.


857
0:43:49,38 --> 0:43:53,15
And when I say seeds, I
mean the reproductive organ


858
0:43:53,15 --> 0:43:56,76
of the plant, and I'm including
grains, legumes, nuts,


859
0:43:56,76 --> 0:43:58,83
and seeds.


860
0:43:58,83 --> 0:44:4,206
Seeds, as the reproductive
organ of the plants,


861
0:44:4,206 --> 0:44:7,34
have many nutrients
in them because it's


862
0:44:7,34 --> 0:44:10,18
to feed the next generation.


863
0:44:10,18 --> 0:44:14,58
They also have
defense mechanisms.


864
0:44:14,58 --> 0:44:16,99
Sometimes a shell, which
is nature's way of saying


865
0:44:16,99 --> 0:44:18,37
stay out.


866
0:44:18,37 --> 0:44:23,0
Or chemicals, toxins or
naturally occurring pesticides.


867
0:44:23,0 --> 0:44:25,85
Plants can't run
away from predators.


868
0:44:25,85 --> 0:44:27,29
They are not mobile.


869
0:44:27,29 --> 0:44:29,46
So they have to use
other mechanisms


870
0:44:29,46 --> 0:44:33,19
to defend their offspring or
the reproductive interests.


871
0:44:33,19 --> 0:44:35,16
And they usually
do that by making


872
0:44:35,16 --> 0:44:40,63
seeds or the entire plant
toxic in some way to insects


873
0:44:40,63 --> 0:44:42,21
or herbivores.


874
0:44:42,21 --> 0:44:45,58
They might be OK--
I'm giving them


875
0:44:45,58 --> 0:44:52,75
agency metaphorically-- they
might be OK with an herbivore


876
0:44:52,75 --> 0:44:54,2
coming along,
eating their seeds,


877
0:44:54,2 --> 0:44:56,49
and then not digesting
them and then letting


878
0:44:56,49 --> 0:44:58,37
them come out in their feces.


879
0:44:58,37 --> 0:45:2,11
But they're still then
covered in a casing


880
0:45:2,11 --> 0:45:3,625
to prevent them
from being digested.


881
0:45:3,625 --> 0:45:6,85



882
0:45:6,85 --> 0:45:10,63
Wild almonds contain
cyanide in them.


883
0:45:10,63 --> 0:45:12,58
Apple seeds also
have cyanide in them.


884
0:45:12,58 --> 0:45:15,11
Many fruit pits are poisonous.


885
0:45:15,11 --> 0:45:19,46
And every year some kid
will eat like a peach pit


886
0:45:19,46 --> 0:45:22,72
or a nectarine pit and have to
go to poison control or die.


887
0:45:22,72 --> 0:45:26,14



888
0:45:26,14 --> 0:45:28,47
You basically go
through seeds, and it's


889
0:45:28,47 --> 0:45:32,79
a huge list of things that
can irritate the stomach


890
0:45:32,79 --> 0:45:35,9
or the reproductive
system of the animals


891
0:45:35,9 --> 0:45:36,98
that are consuming them.


892
0:45:36,98 --> 0:45:39,79
Sheep in New Zealand
and Australia,


893
0:45:39,79 --> 0:45:42,83
you have to keep them away
from certain pasture legumes


894
0:45:42,83 --> 0:45:45,21
because if the ewes
eat too many of them,


895
0:45:45,21 --> 0:45:48,47
they have higher rates of
miscarriage or become fertile,


896
0:45:48,47 --> 0:45:51,51
which is an adaptation.


897
0:45:51,51 --> 0:45:53,78
That's exactly what
the legumes "want"


898
0:45:53,78 --> 0:45:58,37
to do because any ewes
that have a taste for them


899
0:45:58,37 --> 0:46:1,32
don't have offspring.


900
0:46:1,32 --> 0:46:7,34
So there's a general
concern with eating diets


901
0:46:7,34 --> 0:46:11,55
that are high in seeds,
particularly the same seed


902
0:46:11,55 --> 0:46:17,4
over and over, because they can
cause a lot of health problems


903
0:46:17,4 --> 0:46:19,25
in concentrated qualities.


904
0:46:19,25 --> 0:46:21,44
And if they're not prepared
in traditional ways.


905
0:46:21,44 --> 0:46:24,42
Traditional ways of preparing
nuts and seeds and grains


906
0:46:24,42 --> 0:46:32,42
and legumes-- soaking,
fermenting, baking, sprouting.


907
0:46:32,42 --> 0:46:35,86
All of these traditional
methods of preparing seeds


908
0:46:35,86 --> 0:46:39,5
were ways of deactivating some
of these problematic toxins


909
0:46:39,5 --> 0:46:39,58
in them.


910
0:46:39,58 --> 0:46:41,1
And we've sort of
forgotten that.


911
0:46:41,1 --> 0:46:45,36
And now we eat tons of
wheat, corn, and soy prepared


912
0:46:45,36 --> 0:46:47,0
in untraditional ways.


913
0:46:47,0 --> 0:46:51,98
And so that's the main reason
for being skeptical of them


914
0:46:51,98 --> 0:46:52,85
from the outset.


915
0:46:52,85 --> 0:46:54,81
White rice is
basically carbohydrate.


916
0:46:54,81 --> 0:46:58,87
If you want more carbohydrate
in your diet, eat it.


917
0:46:58,87 --> 0:47:0,536
If you want less, don't.


918
0:47:0,536 --> 0:47:3,75
I like the texture of it.


919
0:47:3,75 --> 0:47:5,3
So I eat it.


920
0:47:5,3 --> 0:47:8,67
And I can handle
the carbohydrate.


921
0:47:8,67 --> 0:47:10,326
What was your other question?


922
0:47:10,326 --> 0:47:13,303
AUDIENCE: It was about
whether increasing metabolism


923
0:47:13,303 --> 0:47:16,37
by wearing less clothing
or exposure to the cold


924
0:47:16,37 --> 0:47:17,62
is a good thing because then--


925
0:47:17,62 --> 0:47:20,81



926
0:47:20,81 --> 0:47:22,52
JOHN DURANT: Yeah
I'm not sure I have


927
0:47:22,52 --> 0:47:25,85
a very good answer
to that question.


928
0:47:25,85 --> 0:47:32,2
I don't know how much trying
to slow down your metabolism


929
0:47:32,2 --> 0:47:35,77
is feasible, and how much
it might or might not


930
0:47:35,77 --> 0:47:38,26
add to your longevity
at the end of your life.


931
0:47:38,26 --> 0:47:41,61
Is it an extra 20 days
when you're 87 years old?


932
0:47:41,61 --> 0:47:43,12
I don't know.


933
0:47:43,12 --> 0:47:46,59
So I would do whatever.


934
0:47:46,59 --> 0:47:50,14
If you get better sleep
on a harder surface when


935
0:47:50,14 --> 0:47:54,97
it's chilly, then
I would do that.


936
0:47:54,97 --> 0:47:58,31
And yeah--


937
0:47:58,31 --> 0:48:0,92
AUDIENCE: I'm personally
really glad I do paleo,


938
0:48:0,92 --> 0:48:3,78
and I feel fortunate that
I can, because there's


939
0:48:3,78 --> 0:48:5,59
a farmer's market
that I can go to.


940
0:48:5,59 --> 0:48:8,63
And I have the wherewithal to
buy expensive grass-fed beef.


941
0:48:8,63 --> 0:48:11,78
And I live in a country that
gives me an internet where


942
0:48:11,78 --> 0:48:14,78
I can go and I read your
blog and listen to podcasts.


943
0:48:14,78 --> 0:48:21,69
Is there a future for paleo in
Africa or in Southeast Asia?


944
0:48:21,69 --> 0:48:25,29
Is there a future where billions
of people around the world


945
0:48:25,29 --> 0:48:26,15
are eating paleo?


946
0:48:26,15 --> 0:48:28,255
And can be sustain that?


947
0:48:28,255 --> 0:48:30,642



948
0:48:30,642 --> 0:48:32,85
Is it just sort of like a
fad that upper middle-class


949
0:48:32,85 --> 0:48:34,84
people in America
are going to embrace?


950
0:48:34,84 --> 0:48:39,18
JOHN DURANT: Well, we can learn
a lot about human health even


951
0:48:39,18 --> 0:48:42,16
if everybody in the world
does not adopt this diet,


952
0:48:42,16 --> 0:48:42,98
which they won't.


953
0:48:42,98 --> 0:48:46,3
Even if everybody had the
capability to do so, everybody


954
0:48:46,3 --> 0:48:47,94
wouldn't.


955
0:48:47,94 --> 0:48:51,2
So first, the benefit
of some people


956
0:48:51,2 --> 0:48:53,97
experimenting with
this is simply


957
0:48:53,97 --> 0:48:58,86
learning about human metabolism
and what makes folks healthy.


958
0:48:58,86 --> 0:49:2,62



959
0:49:2,62 --> 0:49:6,59
Right now, the early
years of paleo-- people


960
0:49:6,59 --> 0:49:9,94
are painting with broad strokes.


961
0:49:9,94 --> 0:49:11,85
Grains are bad.


962
0:49:11,85 --> 0:49:14,61
Well maybe it will turn
out, over years of research,


963
0:49:14,61 --> 0:49:17,87
that gluten grains
are the worst.


964
0:49:17,87 --> 0:49:22,45
But if you're dealing with
non-gluten grains, quinoa


965
0:49:22,45 --> 0:49:26,17
or something else, many
people can digest that better.


966
0:49:26,17 --> 0:49:28,92
Or maybe we'll
learn that you just


967
0:49:28,92 --> 0:49:31,49
need to introduce certain
types of gut bacteria


968
0:49:31,49 --> 0:49:33,51
into people's
stomachs and then they


969
0:49:33,51 --> 0:49:37,1
have fewer negative reactions
to a particular grain.


970
0:49:37,1 --> 0:49:42,8
So, there may be changes in
how we think about paleo,


971
0:49:42,8 --> 0:49:44,58
or how we think about
different grains that


972
0:49:44,58 --> 0:49:47,5
make it more
accessible to people.


973
0:49:47,5 --> 0:49:50,51
Or make aspect of
paleo irrelevant.


974
0:49:50,51 --> 0:49:54,3
You mentioned the insect
company-- or the cricket


975
0:49:54,3 --> 0:49:56,37
protein bar company
that I'm helping out.


976
0:49:56,37 --> 0:50:0,4



977
0:50:0,4 --> 0:50:3,2
Insects are eaten as a
nutritious and inexpensive


978
0:50:3,2 --> 0:50:6,1
source of protein
all over the world,


979
0:50:6,1 --> 0:50:8,65
except for the Western world.


980
0:50:8,65 --> 0:50:12,1
But even crickets,
grasshoppers, and locusts


981
0:50:12,1 --> 0:50:15,95
are fine under kosher
and halal rules.


982
0:50:15,95 --> 0:50:19,2
And there's really
no good reason


983
0:50:19,2 --> 0:50:23,29
other than a sense of
discuss and tradition,


984
0:50:23,29 --> 0:50:28,48
recent tradition, to avoid
eating insects and taking


985
0:50:28,48 --> 0:50:30,19
advantage of them.


986
0:50:30,19 --> 0:50:34,93
The amino acid
profile of insects


987
0:50:34,93 --> 0:50:37,92
is beautiful, most of them.


988
0:50:37,92 --> 0:50:42,97
You don't have to sort of mix
and match protein sources.


989
0:50:42,97 --> 0:50:50,73
They require fewer resources
to raise, water in particular.


990
0:50:50,73 --> 0:50:55,45
And for ethical reasons, they
have a less well-developed


991
0:50:55,45 --> 0:50:59,68
neurological system,
and are adapted


992
0:50:59,68 --> 0:51:1,44
to living in very
close quarters.


993
0:51:1,44 --> 0:51:5,89
So that's an area where
paleo could actually,


994
0:51:5,89 --> 0:51:12,85
in some respects, make healthy
eating more sustainable.


995
0:51:12,85 --> 0:51:17,65
But is everybody going to
live off of grass-fed beef?


996
0:51:17,65 --> 0:51:18,3
No.


997
0:51:18,3 --> 0:51:22,42
But you have a small group
of people making innovations,


998
0:51:22,42 --> 0:51:26,29
and it also incentivizes
the big players,


999
0:51:26,29 --> 0:51:28,46
the big agricultural
companies to start


1000
0:51:28,46 --> 0:51:30,58
to make changes to
how they do things.


1001
0:51:30,58 --> 0:51:33,5
And they can make small
tweaks in their supply chain,


1002
0:51:33,5 --> 0:51:35,38
or in their
treatment of animals,


1003
0:51:35,38 --> 0:51:38,7
that can have a huge
difference on the environment


1004
0:51:38,7 --> 0:51:42,15
and on ethical issues, simply
because they're now responding


1005
0:51:42,15 --> 0:51:46,3
to a 2% of the market, 3% of the
market, 5% of the market that


1006
0:51:46,3 --> 0:51:49,81
is profitable and growing
that they want to get in on.


1007
0:51:49,81 --> 0:51:52,349



1008
0:51:52,349 --> 0:51:53,265
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


1009
0:51:53,265 --> 0:51:55,872



1010
0:51:55,872 --> 0:51:56,83
JOHN DURANT: All right.


1011
0:51:56,83 --> 0:52:1,333
AUDIENCE: When you look
at the line from paleo up,


1012
0:52:1,333 --> 0:52:4,347
the idea agricultural
societies fare


1013
0:52:4,347 --> 0:52:6,842
better because they made
cheaper [INAUDIBLE].


1014
0:52:6,842 --> 0:52:7,84
That's why.


1015
0:52:7,84 --> 0:52:9,62
It's an evolutionary
process also--


1016
0:52:9,62 --> 0:52:9,9
JOHN DURANT: Right.


1017
0:52:9,9 --> 0:52:10,46
It's growth.


1018
0:52:10,46 --> 0:52:13,813
AUDIENCE: --but And
so I guess like,


1019
0:52:13,813 --> 0:52:16,687
do you think the cricket
thing is like-- I mean,


1020
0:52:16,687 --> 0:52:18,795
those calories are going
to be more expensive.


1021
0:52:18,795 --> 0:52:22,2
It's more expensive
than simple grains.


1022
0:52:22,2 --> 0:52:26,202
So it's less efficient,
more expensive calories.


1023
0:52:26,202 --> 0:52:28,259
Is that the right
thing to do when


1024
0:52:28,259 --> 0:52:30,55
throughout all these periods,
and we're thinking about,


1025
0:52:30,55 --> 0:52:33,362
how are we going to get enough
calories to feed everybody?


1026
0:52:33,362 --> 0:52:34,778
Like throughout
these times, there


1027
0:52:34,778 --> 0:52:36,425
have been a hundred
people who've


1028
0:52:36,425 --> 0:52:37,966
been like, oh my
god, we're not going


1029
0:52:37,966 --> 0:52:38,828
to be able to feed
all these people.


1030
0:52:38,828 --> 0:52:40,292
And they come up
with some new way


1031
0:52:40,292 --> 0:52:43,22
of breeding some kind of
corn, and then OK cool--


1032
0:52:43,22 --> 0:52:45,74
JOHN DURANT: Right,
well right now, there


1033
0:52:45,74 --> 0:52:47,54
are enough calories
to feed every one,


1034
0:52:47,54 --> 0:52:51,75
and the main impediments are
institutions and infrastructure


1035
0:52:51,75 --> 0:52:56,74
and growth in poor
parts of the world.


1036
0:52:56,74 --> 0:53:0,39
But if more people
continue to eat meat,


1037
0:53:0,39 --> 0:53:4,23
that does take more resources
and things like that.


1038
0:53:4,23 --> 0:53:9,6
The problem with
corn or soy or any


1039
0:53:9,6 --> 0:53:10,71
of these grains
as protein sources


1040
0:53:10,71 --> 0:53:12,68
is they're not very
good protein sources.


1041
0:53:12,68 --> 0:53:14,3
They're incomplete.


1042
0:53:14,3 --> 0:53:16,5
And eaten in large
quantities, they


1043
0:53:16,5 --> 0:53:18,45
can cause health problems too.


1044
0:53:18,45 --> 0:53:24,44
So I don't know all the
details of the ins and outs


1045
0:53:24,44 --> 0:53:27,58
of the resources
required to grow insects.


1046
0:53:27,58 --> 0:53:30,0
We're sort of exploring
that right now.


1047
0:53:30,0 --> 0:53:35,47
But it's worth
exploring, I think.


1048
0:53:35,47 --> 0:53:37,895
AUDIENCE: What's
[INAUDIBLE] hacking


1049
0:53:37,895 --> 0:53:39,935
that this is predicated on.


1050
0:53:39,935 --> 0:53:42,848
I was wondering-- let's
say my real estate


1051
0:53:42,848 --> 0:53:44,796
for my grandchildren
[INAUDIBLE].


1052
0:53:44,796 --> 0:53:49,179



1053
0:53:49,179 --> 0:53:56,27
What about [INAUDIBLE]
cheaper diet with fast food?


1054
0:53:56,27 --> 0:53:59,478
Then you move back
towards an expensive diet


1055
0:53:59,478 --> 0:54:1,918
of very good quality food.


1056
0:54:1,918 --> 0:54:3,87
Wouldn't we want, a
million years from now,


1057
0:54:3,87 --> 0:54:5,822
everyone to just
get refined sugar


1058
0:54:5,822 --> 0:54:9,29
and be perfectly fine with it,
and go on with their lives,


1059
0:54:9,29 --> 0:54:11,7
rather than everybody
going back to--


1060
0:54:11,7 --> 0:54:12,778
JOHN DURANT: Well that
will never happen.


1061
0:54:12,778 --> 0:54:14,2
AUDIENCE: How do you know?


1062
0:54:14,2 --> 0:54:15,325
JOHN DURANT: Well, I mean--


1063
0:54:15,325 --> 0:54:17,911
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?


1064
0:54:17,911 --> 0:54:19,41
JOHN DURANT:
--evolution takes time.


1065
0:54:19,41 --> 0:54:20,744
It takes many, many generations.


1066
0:54:20,744 --> 0:54:22,784
AUDIENCE: I'm just wondering
about the direction.


1067
0:54:22,784 --> 0:54:23,81
Why not move--


1068
0:54:23,81 --> 0:54:25,462
AUDIENCE: Bioengineering
is faster.


1069
0:54:25,462 --> 0:54:27,386
AUDIENCE: Yeah, why
are we not moving


1070
0:54:27,386 --> 0:54:31,8
in that direction [INAUDIBLE]
perfectly fine [INAUDIBLE]?


1071
0:54:31,8 --> 0:54:36,31
JOHN DURANT: Well this is
an area where I'm probably


1072
0:54:36,31 --> 0:54:38,8
in a little bit of tension
with some of the folks here,


1073
0:54:38,8 --> 0:54:41,45
or the tech world.


1074
0:54:41,45 --> 0:54:44,58
Throughout history,
you have engineers


1075
0:54:44,58 --> 0:54:47,32
who are very hubristic and think
that they can centrally plan


1076
0:54:47,32 --> 0:54:52,3
and design things
better than nature does,


1077
0:54:52,3 --> 0:54:55,0
or a better than a
decentralized process does.


1078
0:54:55,0 --> 0:54:57,67
And many times they can,
then occasionally they


1079
0:54:57,67 --> 0:55:0,68
fail magnificently.


1080
0:55:0,68 --> 0:55:6,7
So yes, we can produce more
calories with wheat and corn,


1081
0:55:6,7 --> 0:55:8,3
and feed more people.


1082
0:55:8,3 --> 0:55:10,16
And we can adapt to that
somewhat over periods


1083
0:55:10,16 --> 0:55:11,1
of generations.


1084
0:55:11,1 --> 0:55:12,8
But it also exposes
you to famine.


1085
0:55:12,8 --> 0:55:15,67
You basically didn't have
famine until we became heavily


1086
0:55:15,67 --> 0:55:19,6
dependent on a few cereal
grains, and in a sense,


1087
0:55:19,6 --> 0:55:22,393
we put all our
eggs in one basket.


1088
0:55:22,393 --> 0:55:26,722
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
famine throughout


1089
0:55:26,722 --> 0:55:31,532
recorded and unrecorded history
and various cultures going back


1090
0:55:31,532 --> 0:55:34,164
tens of thousands of years.


1091
0:55:34,164 --> 0:55:35,58
JOHN DURANT: Hunter
gatherers tend


1092
0:55:35,58 --> 0:55:41,247
to have more diverse
diets than other people.


1093
0:55:41,247 --> 0:55:42,8
And they're nomadic.


1094
0:55:42,8 --> 0:55:44,69
So when you have a
more diverse portfolio,


1095
0:55:44,69 --> 0:55:48,19
you're less likely-- you're
less dependent on any one food


1096
0:55:48,19 --> 0:55:49,29
source.


1097
0:55:49,29 --> 0:55:51,82
If it fails, it's
not catastrophic.


1098
0:55:51,82 --> 0:55:54,49
And if you're nomadic, you
can quickly up and move.


1099
0:55:54,49 --> 0:55:58,41
So it's well established
among anthropologists


1100
0:55:58,41 --> 0:56:1,8
that-- it's not to say
there weren't periods


1101
0:56:1,8 --> 0:56:7,38
when people ran out of
food or went hungry.


1102
0:56:7,38 --> 0:56:11,52
But famine shot
up when we started


1103
0:56:11,52 --> 0:56:13,5
betting on a few cereal grains.


1104
0:56:13,5 --> 0:56:14,785
And if you didn't
get enough rain,


1105
0:56:14,785 --> 0:56:17,142
or if you didn't store enough
grain, boom, you're done.


1106
0:56:17,142 --> 0:56:17,85
You're wiped out.


1107
0:56:17,85 --> 0:56:21,15
AUDIENCE: There was a lot more
people to starve. [INAUDIBLE]


1108
0:56:21,15 --> 0:56:22,9
population controlled
through agriculture.


1109
0:56:22,9 --> 0:56:25,97
But the Inuit, for example,
starved regularly up


1110
0:56:25,97 --> 0:56:29,935
until they integrated
into the modern day,


1111
0:56:29,935 --> 0:56:33,89
into the rest of the world.


1112
0:56:33,89 --> 0:56:36,43
JOHN DURANT: I don't
know details on that.


1113
0:56:36,43 --> 0:56:39,739
But I bet I would
disagree with you on that.


1114
0:56:39,739 --> 0:56:40,655
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


1115
0:56:40,655 --> 0:56:44,3



1116
0:56:44,3 --> 0:56:46,46
JOHN DURANT: Like soylent,
like than just raised--


1117
0:56:46,46 --> 0:56:49,226
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
eventually the human organism


1118
0:56:49,226 --> 0:56:50,61
is going to adapt to it.


1119
0:56:50,61 --> 0:56:53,14
JOHN DURANT: No, no, no, no, no.


1120
0:56:53,14 --> 0:57:0,14
So you only get
adaptation if people--


1121
0:57:0,14 --> 0:57:4,37
if there's differential
reproductive success--


1122
0:57:4,37 --> 0:57:9,125
if some people are having more
babies and other people aren't.


1123
0:57:9,125 --> 0:57:14,77
So you would need, over a
very long period of time,


1124
0:57:14,77 --> 0:57:18,66
you would need the people
that are thriving best


1125
0:57:18,66 --> 0:57:25,585
on heavily industrial diets to
also have the most children.


1126
0:57:25,585 --> 0:57:27,96
I mean, maybe the Chinese are
willing to do an experiment


1127
0:57:27,96 --> 0:57:28,59
like that.


1128
0:57:28,59 --> 0:57:31,9
But not in like a
democratic society.


1129
0:57:31,9 --> 0:57:40,54
And it requires-- even lactose
tolerance is only in about 30--


1130
0:57:40,54 --> 0:57:44,76
it's one gene that
had enormous benefits.


1131
0:57:44,76 --> 0:57:48,4
One gene, enormous benefits,
and it only moved to about 35%


1132
0:57:48,4 --> 0:57:52,52
of the population in a
6,000 or 7,000 year period.


1133
0:57:52,52 --> 0:57:54,79
That is like the
most rapid example


1134
0:57:54,79 --> 0:57:57,14
that we have of
something with one


1135
0:57:57,14 --> 0:58:1,1
gene that needs to be flipped,
enormous benefits and even


1136
0:58:1,1 --> 0:58:3,93
over 7,000 years or whatever.


1137
0:58:3,93 --> 0:58:6,87
It's 35% of global population.


1138
0:58:6,87 --> 0:58:13,6
So it's not feasible
to think that we're


1139
0:58:13,6 --> 0:58:15,234
going to change through--


1140
0:58:15,234 --> 0:58:16,15
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


1141
0:58:16,15 --> 0:58:19,5



1142
0:58:19,5 --> 0:58:22,73
JOHN DURANT: Well there
are other mechanisms.


1143
0:58:22,73 --> 0:58:30,81
Bill Gates has been investing
in artificial meat sources.


1144
0:58:30,81 --> 0:58:34,3
There are bioengineers
working on-- there


1145
0:58:34,3 --> 0:58:37,5
may be ways of
engineering bacteria,


1146
0:58:37,5 --> 0:58:41,85
or harnessing bacteria to
basically digest inedible food


1147
0:58:41,85 --> 0:58:47,64
sources for us, and then
we can digest the output.


1148
0:58:47,64 --> 0:58:54,5
So I think that's where the
innovation will happen, not so


1149
0:58:54,5 --> 0:58:56,32
much in whether we
change our own genome


1150
0:58:56,32 --> 0:58:57,575
or anything like that.


1151
0:58:57,575 --> 0:58:59,555
AUDIENCE: So we're
