1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:18,98
  GOOD DAY EVERYONE. ARE WE ALL HAPPY? LET'S
   GET UNDERWAY, PLEASE. JUST ONE, A REMINDER,


2
0:0:18,98 --> 0:0:25,39
I HAVE   OFFICE HOURS TODAY AFTER LECTURE.
VERY HAPPY TO TALK   TO YOU OR TAKE QUESTIONS


3
0:0:25,39 --> 0:0:31,59
DURING LECTURE. SO, PLEASE   TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THAT. ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO SIGNED  


4
0:0:31,59 --> 0:0:35,53
 UP FOR THE BOOK CLUB, I SEEM TO HAVE THE
EMAIL WRONG,   FOR TIM MCCAULLY, IF YOU


5
0:0:35,53 --> 0:0:44,129
COULD SEE ME AFTER, I HAVE   YOUR EMAIL
WRONG OR SOMETHING. THANK YOU. A REMINDER


6
0:0:44,129 --> 0:0:48,559
   FOR THOSE WHO ARE DOING THE READING THAT
THERE IS   A COPY OF THE CHAPTERS WE ARE


7
0:0:48,559 --> 0:0:55,73
READING FOR THIS WEEK   IN THE BIO 1B GSI
ROOM. THAT A WAY, I THINK. THAT YOU   CAN


8
0:0:55,73 --> 0:1:0,969
PHOTOCOPY IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET
THE   BOOK. IF OTHERS WANT TO JOIN, IT IS


9
0:1:0,969 --> 0:1:4,85
NOT TOO LATE. I   WILL EVEN THROWN IN THE
2 OF THE MBZ (SIC) FOR THOSE   WHO STICK


10
0:1:4,85 --> 0:1:13,86
AT IT. VERY COOL STUFF.   OKAY, I HAVE TO
START WITH A MEA CULPA TODAY.   ONE OF THE


11
0:1:13,86 --> 0:1:20,43
GSI'S POINTED OUT ME THAT I MADE A  HUGE
BOTANICAL BLUNDER. BECAUSE I AM A ZOOLOGIST.


12
0:1:20,43 --> 0:1:26,75
I   EAT PLANTS AND THEN I (INAUDIBLE). SO,
TURNS OUT THAT   POLLEN CONTAINS SPERM SO


13
0:1:26,75 --> 0:1:32,7
THAT FIGURE WAS RIGHT. THE   MALE GAMETE
IN PLANT IS THE SPERM. THEY ARE RIGHT I 


14
0:1:32,7 --> 0:1:43,27
  AM WRONG. THERE YOU GO THE OTHER MESSAGE
IS, YOUR   GSI'S ARE ALWAYS RIGHT. OKAY,


15
0:1:43,27 --> 0:1:50,24
SO IN THE LAST LECTURE   WE TALKED ABOUT
THE NEODARWINIAN SYNTHESIS, WHICH IS   


16
0:1:50,24 --> 0:1:54,74
THE BRINGING TOGETHER THE PRINCIPLES OF EVOLUTION
FOR   DARWIN AND WALLACE WITH THE MECHANICS


17
0:1:54,74 --> 0:2:4,25
OF INHERITANCE,   ALA, MENDEL, AND THEN
SUBSEQUENTLY BRING IN KNOWLEDGE   OF DNA'S


18
0:2:4,25 --> 0:2:9,86
AND GENETIC MATERIALS, GENOMES AND SO ON.
   SO, INVIGORATING THE WHOLE FIELD OF EVOLUTION.


19
0:2:9,86 --> 0:2:17,8
AND   ONE OF THE POINTS THAT I WANT YOU
TAKE FROM THAT AS   TECHNOLOGY LABELS, NEW


20
0:2:17,8 --> 0:2:23,959
DISCOVERIES LIKE GENOME   ARCHITECTURE,
THE VARIATIONS IN GENES, AND SO FORTH.  


21
0:2:23,959 --> 0:2:30,33
 WE ARE REFINING THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION
IN TERMS OF   MECHANISMS BUT THE FUNDAMENTALS


22
0:2:30,33 --> 0:2:35,61
HAVEN'T CHANGED. SO   DARWIN GOT IT RIGHT
AND WAS ABLE TO MAKE PREDICTIONS  TO HELP


23
0:2:35,61 --> 0:2:43,99
US UNDERSTAND DETAILS OF THE NATURAL WORLD.
   ANYONE LEAVE THIS BEHIND, A LITTLE GOLD


24
0:2:43,99 --> 0:2:55,2
THINGY. ALL   RIGHT. SO, WE ARE LOOKING
AT THE FIELD OF POPULATION   GENETICS. THAT


25
0:2:55,2 --> 0:3:1,58
IS, THE DYNAMICS OF GENETIC VARIATION  
 WITHIN POPULATIONS. AND LOOKED AT THE HARDY-WEINBERG


26
0:3:1,58 --> 0:3:6,94
   EQUILIBRIUM, WHICH IS A VERY SIMPLE WAY
OF PREDICTING   WHAT THE GENOTYPE FREQUENCIES


27
0:3:6,94 --> 0:3:13,95
IN THE POPULATION SHOULD   BE GIVEN THE
FREQUENCIES OF THE ALLELES IN THAT   POPULATION.


28
0:3:13,95 --> 0:3:23,659
SO YOUR FAVORITE THING, P SQUARED 2PQ AND
   Q SQUARED. WE ENDED UP WITH APPLICATION


29
0:3:23,659 --> 0:3:32,9
OF THAT.   WHICH IS TO PREDICT


30
0:3:32,9 --> 0:3:46,98
THE FREQUENCY OF HETEROZYGOTES FOR   RECESSIVE
TRAITS OR RECESSIVE ALLELES.   I JUST WANT


31
0:3:46,98 --> 0:3:52,209
TO TOUCH ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK I   CONFUSED
PEOPLE AS I WENT THROUGH IT AND THEN WE WILL


32
0:3:52,209 --> 0:3:58,76
   GO ON TODAY TO ASSUMPTIONS OF HARDY-WEINBERG
AND BRING   IN THINGS LIKE GENETIC DRIFT


33
0:3:58,76 --> 0:4:5,159
AND MUTATION AND SEE WHAT   THAT DOES TO
POPULATIONS. SO AGAIN TO REMIND YOU, IF 


34
0:4:5,159 --> 0:4:13,6
  WE HAVE TWO ALLELES IN A DIPLOID POPULATION
WE HAVE 3  GENOTYPES. IF A IS RECESSIVE


35
0:4:13,6 --> 0:4:21,979
OVER B, THESE ARE   A SINGLE PHENOTYPE.
THIS IS THE DOMINANT PHENOTYPE   THAT IS


36
0:4:21,979 --> 0:4:29,11
THE RECESSIVE PHENOTYPE. THINK ABOUT THE 
  PURPLE AND WHITE FLOWERS AND THE EXPECTED


37
0:4:29,11 --> 0:4:40,2
FREQUENCY ON   THE HARDY-WEINBERG OF THIS
PHENOTYPE IS PÓ PLUS 2PQ.   EXPECTED FREQUENCY


38
0:4:40,2 --> 0:4:45,83
OF THIS HOMOZYGOTE, WE EXPECT   THE FREQUENCY
OF THE HETEROZYGOTE. THE EXPECTED   FREQUENCY


39
0:4:45,83 --> 0:4:59,49
OF THIS PHENOTYPE IS QÓ. SO THAT GIVES US
A   WAY TO ESTIMATE THE FREQUENCY OF THIS


40
0:4:59,49 --> 0:5:7,69
ALLELE GIVEN THE   OBSERVED FREQUENCY OF
THAT PHENOTYPE. IF THE   FREQUENCY OF THE


41
0:5:7,69 --> 0:5:18,77
B PHENOTYPE IS QÓ, THEN THE FREQUENCY  
 OF THE B ALLELE IS THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE


42
0:5:18,77 --> 0:5:33,62
FREQUENCY OF   THE B PHENOTYPE, THE RECESSIVE
PHENOTYPE,
WHICH IS Q.   WE KNOW THE P IS ONE MINUS


43
0:5:33,62 --> 0:5:39,5
Q. JUST TWO ALLELES. THIS   CAN BE GENERALIZED
TO ANY NUMBER OF ALLELES, BY THE   WAY.


44
0:5:39,5 --> 0:5:44,61
BUT I AM JUST DOING THE TWO ALLELE SITUATIONS.
   WE HAVE Q AND AN ESTIMATE OF Q AND AN


45
0:5:44,61 --> 0:5:59,669
ESTIMATE OF P.   SO 2PQ IS OUR ESTIMATE
OF THE FREQUENCY OF THE  HETEROZYGOTE, ASSUMING


46
0:5:59,669 --> 0:6:9,77
GENOTYPES ARE IN THE   HARDY-WEINBERG PROPORTIONS.
WE HAVE TO ASSUME   HARDY-WEINBERG TO DO


47
0:6:9,77 --> 0:6:18,43
THIS. OKAY? SO THEN, ARE YOU   ALL WITH
ME ON THAT? IT IS A USEFUL THING TO BE  


48
0:6:18,43 --> 0:6:26,259
 WHETHER IN DIAGNOSTICS OR WHATEVER. LET'S
LOOK AT   THAT CASE OF THE DIAGNOSTICS FOR


49
0:6:26,259 --> 0:6:36,27
CYSTIC FIBROSIS.   


50
0:6:36,27 --> 0:6:54,629
THE FREQUENCY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO DISPLAY THAT
   TRAIT IS 0.0004. 4 IN TEN THOUSAND. ASSUMING


51
0:6:54,629 --> 0:7:10,9
   HARDY-WEINBERG, THAT IS QÓ. SO, Q IS
THE SQUARE   ROOT OF THAT. 0.02. 2PQ IS


52
0:7:10,9 --> 0:7:13,93
AN ESTIMATE OF THE   INDIVIDUALS WHO CARRY
THE ALLELE BUT DO NOT EXPRESS   IT, BECAUSE


53
0:7:13,93 --> 0:7:31,99
IT IS RECESSIVE. 0.02 TIMES .98 TIMES  
 2. THE P IS ONE MINUS THIS.
WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY   0.04 IN THE CAUCASIAN


54
0:7:31,99 --> 0:7:40,18
POPULATION. 1 IN 25 OR 1 IN   21 ROUGHLY,
INDIVIDUALS CARRY THIS ALLELE IN   HETEROZYGOUS


55
0:7:40,18 --> 0:7:47,31
STATE BUT DON'T EXPRESS IT BECAUSE IT  
 IS RECESSIVE. OKAY? I MESSED UP THE NUMBERS


56
0:7:47,31 --> 0:7:55,3
A BIT   ON MONDAY, SO ARE YOU WITH ME ON
THAT? SO, LET'S  GO ON. ONE THING TO NOTICE


57
0:7:55,3 --> 0:8:4,31
HERE THIS FOLLOWS   DIRECTLY FROM THE MATH
THAT THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS   ALLELE IS MUCH


58
0:8:4,31 --> 0:8:13,669
MORE COMMON IN HETEROZYGOTES THAN IT   
IS IN THE HOMOZYGOUS FORM. RARE ALLELES ARE


59
0:8:13,669 --> 0:8:28,44
MOSTLY   FOUND IN THE HETEROZYGOUS CONDITION
RATHER THAT THE   HOMOZYGOUS CONDITION.


60
0:8:28,44 --> 0:8:33,68
THIS BECOMES IMPORTANT IN   A NUMBER OF
ASPECTS OF EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS THAT  


61
0:8:33,68 --> 0:8:41,57
 WE WILL COME BACK TO.   


62
0:8:41,57 --> 0:8:59,37
SO FOR RARE ALLELES, THAT IS, Q, THE FREQUENCY
   OF THE B ALLELE, LESS THAN 0.1, ROUGHLY.


63
0:8:59,37 --> 0:9:14,0
QÓ IS MUCH   LESS THAN 2 PQ. THAT ALLELE
OCCURS MOST OFTEN IN THE   HETEROZYGOUS


64
0:9:14,0 --> 0:9:23,43
STATE. THE FACT THAT WE CAN DO A LITTLE 
  GRAPH OF THAT JUST BY LOOKING AT THE EXPECTED


65
0:9:23,43 --> 0:9:34,18
   FREQUENCIES OF THESE GENOTYPES GIVEN
ALLELE FREQUENCY.   AND THIS IS THE FREQUENCY


66
0:9:34,18 --> 0:9:45,8
OF THE A ALLELE, FROM   LOW TO HIGH. AND
THE FREQUENCY OF THE GENOTYPES, SO   THE


67
0:9:45,8 --> 0:9:58,279
HOMOZYGOTE IS QÓ. LOOKS LIKE THIS IN TERMS
OF   PROPORTION IN POPULATION GIVEN CHANGE


68
0:9:58,279 --> 0:10:11,23
IN THE ALLELE  FREQUENCY.   BUT, HETEROZYGOTES
LOOK LIKE THIS. SO LET'S   TAKE OUR EXAMPLE


69
0:10:11,23 --> 0:10:21,74
OF A RARE ALLELE AT 0.1. SOMEWHERE   HERE.
SO, IF WE LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY OF THE  


70
0:10:21,74 --> 0:10:33,95
 HOMOZYGOUS STATE THAT IS QÓ, 0.01. LOOK
AT HOW OFTEN   THAT ALLELE TURNS UP IN HETEROZYGOTES.


71
0:10:33,95 --> 0:10:45,76
0.18. THIS IS   GENERALLY TRUE IN A RANDOM
MATING POPULATION, ASSUMING   HARDY-WEINBERG,


72
0:10:45,76 --> 0:10:53,72
IN PARTICULAR THE POPULATION IS RANDOM  
 MATING. SO, RARE ALLELES ARE MOST COMMON


73
0:10:53,72 --> 0:10:59,64
IN THE   HETEROZGOUS STATE. AND WE WILL
COME BACK TO THAT   A COUPLE TIMES AS WE


74
0:10:59,64 --> 0:11:21,279
GO ON. ARE YOU WITH ME?   YES? P'S AND Q'S.
I CAN'T EVEN READ THIS. YOU   CAN DO IT


75
0:11:21,279 --> 0:11:28,1
THE OTHER WAY AROUND. SO, IT IS THE SAME 
  PRINCIPLE. LET'S CALL THIS P AND LET'S


76
0:11:28,1 --> 0:11:34,51
CALL THIS PÓ.   SAME THING. BRING INTO
LINE WITH THE DIAGRAM. IT IS   THE SAME


77
0:11:34,51 --> 0:11:44,61
THING, ONE JUST RECIPROCAL OF THE OTHER. 
  THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT. OKAY,


78
0:11:44,61 --> 0:11:49,19
SO IN THINKING   BACK TO HARDY WEINBERG
WE MADE A NUMBER OF  ASSUMPTIONS. ONE OF


79
0:11:49,19 --> 0:11:56,56
WHICH WAS LARGE POPULATION SIZE.   THAT
IS, YOU ARE TAKING A SUFFICIENT SAMPLE FROM


80
0:11:56,56 --> 0:12:1,95
THE   POPULATION IN EACH GENERATION SO THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE   CHANCE FLUCTUATIONS IN


81
0:12:1,95 --> 0:12:9,36
THE ALLELE FREQUENCY. SO, NOW   WE WILL
LOOK AT (INAUDIBLE) ASSUMPTION AND LOOK AT


82
0:12:9,36 --> 0:12:30,11
   SMALL POPULATIONS.   THIS IS THE PHENOMENON
CALLED GENETIC DRIFT.   LET'S FORGET GENETICS


83
0:12:30,11 --> 0:12:38,17
FOR A MOMENT AND THINK   ABOUT A SURVEY.
IF YOU ARE BEING SURVEYED ON YOUR   ATTITUDE


84
0:12:38,17 --> 0:12:46,339
TOWARDS A REALLY BIG HIKE IN TUITION FEES.
   IF I JUST PICK 3 OR 4 PEOPLE OUT OF THIS


85
0:12:46,339 --> 0:12:51,269
CLASS AND ASK   THEM WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT
THAT I MAY BY CHANCE PICK   A NON-REPRESENTATIVE


86
0:12:51,269 --> 0:12:56,29
EXAMPLE. MAYBE I WILL PICK SOME   REALLY
RICH PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WHO THINK INCREASED


87
0:12:56,29 --> 0:13:1,94
   TUITION IS GREAT BECAUSE IT WILL HELP
PAY MY SALARY.   IT IS WONDERFUL. IF I ASK


88
0:13:1,94 --> 0:13:7,209
THE ENTIRE 1B CLASS I WILL   PROBABLY GET
A MORE ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE  


89
0:13:7,209 --> 0:13:13,76
 OPINION OF THAT SUBJECT. SAME WITH VOTING.
DO YOU  VOTE NOT AT ALL, DEMOCRATIC, REPUBLICAN.


90
0:13:13,76 --> 0:13:19,829
YOU HAVE   MORE FAITH OR MORE, ACCEPT MORE
READILY THE RESULT IF   10,000 PEOPLE WERE


91
0:13:19,829 --> 0:13:26,0
SURVEYED THAN IF 100 PEOPLE WERE   SURVEYED.
10 THOUSAND IS A BETTER SAMPLE OF THE  


92
0:13:26,0 --> 0:13:32,47
 POPULATION AND OF THE OVERALL VOTING INTENT.
SO, THE   SAME IS TRUE BIOLOGICALLY IN TAKING


93
0:13:32,47 --> 0:13:50,81
GAMETES TO FORM   ZYGOTES. SO, WE HAVE A
BUCKET AND A SPOON. A BUCKET   OF EGGS.


94
0:13:50,81 --> 0:14:1,67
WE ARE GOING TO SAMPLE OUT OF EACH OF THESE
   BUCKETS ONE OF EACH TO FORM THE EMBRYO,


95
0:14:1,67 --> 0:14:9,5
THE ZYGOTE.   SO, BASICALLY THAT IS FERTILIZATION
GOING ON TO FORM   THE NEXT GENERATION.


96
0:14:9,5 --> 0:14:18,47
WE WILL GET A MORE ACCURATE   REPRESENTATION
OF THE TRUE GENETIC STRUCTURE OF THAT  


97
0:14:18,47 --> 0:14:22,17
 POPULATION OF THE VARIATION IF WE TAKE A
BIG EXAMPLE   THAN IF WE TAKE A SMALL SAMPLE.


98
0:14:22,17 --> 0:14:30,98
IF YOU TAKE A SMALL   SAMPLE OUT OF A POPULATION,
THAT IS, IF YOU FORM VERY   FEW ZYGOTES


99
0:14:30,98 --> 0:14:36,37
GOING ON TO ADULTS IN THE NEXT GENERATION
   YOU WILL GET A CHANCE ERROR IN THE FREQUENCY


100
0:14:36,37 --> 0:14:49,899
OF THE   ALLELES. SO, SMALL POPULATIONS,
THIS GIVES RISE TO  RANDOM CHANGE IN ALLELE


101
0:14:49,899 --> 0:14:58,93
FREQUENCIES FROM ONE   GENERATION TO THE
NEXT. IT MIGHT GO UP, IT MIGHT GO   DOWN.


102
0:14:58,93 --> 0:15:3,87
AND THE SMALLER THE POPULATION THE BIGGER
THE   SAMPLING ERROR, THE BIGGER THESE RANDOM


103
0:15:3,87 --> 0:15:12,279
FLUCTUATIONS   IN THE ALLELE FREQUENCY.
SLIDE 3 IS A PRETTY PICTURE   THAT SHOWS


104
0:15:12,279 --> 0:15:18,529
WHAT THIS MIGHT DO IN A POPULATION OF  
 FLOWERS OF SOME SORT. WHERE YOU HAVE RED


105
0:15:18,529 --> 0:15:24,68
ONES AND   WHITE ONES AND PINK ONES, PROBABLY
SNAPDRAGONS. GOING   FROM ONE GENERATION


106
0:15:24,68 --> 0:15:31,66
TO THE NEXT TAKING A VERY SMALL   SAMPLE,
A SMALL POPULATION SIZE. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT


107
0:15:31,66 --> 0:15:35,94
   THE ALLELE FREQUENCY IS CHANGING FROM
ONE GENERATION   TO THE NEXT. REMEMBER,


108
0:15:35,94 --> 0:15:42,41
HARDY WEINBERG PREDICTS NO   CHANGE IN INHERITANCE
ALONE AND PREDICTS NO CHANGE IN   ALLELE


109
0:15:42,41 --> 0:15:47,92
FREQUENCIES. BUT, IN A VERY SMALL POPULATION
   YOU VIOLATED ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS.


110
0:15:47,92 --> 0:16:3,16
SO YOU GET THESE   RANDOM REPEATED CHANGES
IN THE FREQUENCY.   YES?
THE POPULATION ITSELF IS SMALL. SO THE  


111
0:16:3,16 --> 0:16:12,22
 NUMBER OF BREEDING ADULTS IN THE POPULATION
IS SMALL.  A BIG POPULATION TAKING A SMALL


112
0:16:12,22 --> 0:16:21,779
SAMPLE. YEAH. MY   CONTRIVED EXAMPLE IS
ILLUSTRATING SAMPLING ERROR. IN   THIS CASE


113
0:16:21,779 --> 0:16:27,75
IT IS THE POPULATION ITSELF THAT IS SMALL.
   FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT YOU GET


114
0:16:27,75 --> 0:16:38,57
RANDOM CHANGES   IN ALLELE FREQUENCY. 
  SO, IF WE LOOK AT THE CHANGE IN ALLELE


115
0:16:38,57 --> 0:16:51,579
FREQUENCY   OVER GENERATIONS, YOU MIGHT
EXPECT SOME, FORGET THE   HASH MARKS, YOU


116
0:16:51,579 --> 0:16:59,88
GET SOME FLUCTUATION. MAYBE EVEN TO   THE
POINT WHERE ONE ALLELE BECOMES THE ONLY ONE


117
0:16:59,88 --> 0:17:6,1
IN THE   POPULATION AND YOU LOST THE OTHER
ONE, YOU LOST   GENETIC VARIATION. YOU FAILED


118
0:17:6,1 --> 0:17:12,579
TO SAMPLE THE OTHER   ALLELE TYPE IN THE
POPULATION, IN THAT PARTICULAR   GENERATION


119
0:17:12,579 --> 0:17:19,23
OF FORMING THE DIPLOIDS OR THE ZYGOTES. 
  IN A SMALL POPULATION, THIS WOULD BE A


120
0:17:19,23 --> 0:17:32,8
VERY   SMALL POPULATION. IN A LARGER POPULATION,
I CAN'T   DRAW TODAY, THIS IS GOING ON BUT


121
0:17:32,8 --> 0:17:48,53
THE AMPLITUDE IS MUCH   SMALLER FROM ONE
GENERATION TO THE NEXT.   
THAT IS THE SAMPLING ERROR IS LESS.  SO,


122
0:17:48,53 --> 0:17:55,379
WHY DOES THIS MATTER? IT MATTERS IN   A
VARIETY OF CONTEXT. BASICALLY WHERE THE POPULATION


123
0:17:55,379 --> 0:18:6,669
   SIZE IS SMALL. THAT CAN ARISE FROM SEVERAL
DIFFERENT   SITUATIONS. SO, IMAGINE POPULATION


124
0:18:6,669 --> 0:18:22,58
SIZE, WHICH I WILL   CALL N OVER TIME, YOU
MIGHT HAVE A SITUATION WHERE   POPULATION


125
0:18:22,58 --> 0:18:30,4
SIZE IS ALWAYS SMALL.   AND THIS PROCESS
WILL JUST GO ON AND ON AND ON   OR YOU MIGHT


126
0:18:30,4 --> 0:18:37,33
HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU START WITH  
 A BIG POPULATION WHICH BECOMES SMALL, FOR


127
0:18:37,33 --> 0:18:47,57
SOME REASON.   THINGS THAT MIGHT RELATE
TO THIS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN   CONSERVATION


128
0:18:47,57 --> 0:18:55,39
BIOLOGY, LOSS OF HABITAT OR   OVER-HARVESTING.
PRODUCING LARGE POPULATIONS TO VERY   SMALL


129
0:18:55,39 --> 0:19:13,46
POPULATIONS. SO, ONE EXAMPLE IS FROM HABITAT
   LOSS. AN EXAMPLE SHOWN THERE IS FOR PRAIRIE


130
0:19:13,46 --> 0:19:20,4
CHICKENS   ON THE RIGHT-HAND SLIDE OF SLIDE
4. WHICH FORMERLY   OCCUPIED IN VERY LARGE


131
0:19:20,4 --> 0:19:26,11
POPULATIONS, VAST AREAS OF   NATIVE PRAIRIE.
THAT PRAIRIE NOW IS LARGELY LOST DUE   


132
0:19:26,11 --> 0:19:33,12
TO EXPANSION OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE. THERE
IS VERY  SMALL PATCHES OF THIS HABITAT LEFT


133
0:19:33,12 --> 0:19:39,78
AND THE PRAIRIE   CHICKEN POPULATIONS HAVE
BECOME VERY, VERY SMALL. AS   A CONSEQUENCE


134
0:19:39,78 --> 0:19:43,69
THEY HAVE LOST GENETIC VARIATIONS. WE  
 CAN MEASURE THE GENETIC VARIATION IN HISTORICAL


135
0:19:43,69 --> 0:19:49,39
   SAMPLES, SPECIMENS TAKEN 100 OR MORE
YEARS AGO BEFORE   THE HABITAT LOSS. YOU


136
0:19:49,39 --> 0:19:54,26
MEASURE GENETIC VARIATION NOW   AND WE SEE
REDUCTION IN GENETIC VARIATION OF   POPULATION


137
0:19:54,26 --> 0:20:2,539
BECAUSE OF THIS SAMPLING EFFECT, LOSING 
  ALLELES, ALTERNATIVE ALLELES AT LOCI. THAT


138
0:20:2,539 --> 0:20:7,25
CAN ONLY   COME BACK IN BY MUTATION, WHICH
WE WILL SEE LATER IN   A PARTICULAR GENE


139
0:20:7,25 --> 0:20:16,159
IS A VERY RARE EVENT. AS   A CONSEQUENCE
OF THAT, THAT LOSS OF GENETIC VARIATION, 


140
0:20:16,159 --> 0:20:23,429
  THE HATCHING RIGHTS OF THOSE PRAIRIE CHICKENS
HAVE   DECLINED FROM 93 PERCENT TO, I HAVE


141
0:20:23,429 --> 0:20:30,25
FORGOTTEN WHAT THE   EXACT NUMBER IS, TO
LESS THAN 50 PERCENT. THAT IS   IMPACTING


142
0:20:30,25 --> 0:20:37,14
THE REPRODUCTION AND SURVIVAL OF THE PRAIRIE
   CHICKENS. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, WHEN


143
0:20:37,14 --> 0:20:44,44
THEY MIX   POPULATIONS THEY CAN RESTORE
THAT GENETIC VARIATION  AND RESTORE THE


144
0:20:44,44 --> 0:20:53,51
HATCH RIGHT OF THE POPULATION. WHICH   
BRINGS UP ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT, THIS GENETIC


145
0:20:53,51 --> 0:20:57,7
DRIFT   IS CAUSING ALLELE FREQUENCIES TO
BOUNCE AROUND FROM   ONE GENERATION TO THE


146
0:20:57,7 --> 0:21:7,71
NEXT. THAT IS A RANDOM PROCESS.   IN CALIFORNIA,
LIKE TOTALLY RANDOM, I PRACTICED   THAT


147
0:21:7,71 --> 0:21:14,409
FOR TEN YEARS. DO I STILL NOT HAVE IT? LIKE
   TOTALLY RANDOM. NO. I WOULD NEVER MAKE


148
0:21:14,409 --> 0:21:24,23
A VALLEY   GIRL, WOULD I. IMAGINE WE HAVE
POPULATION 1, I REALLY   DO TRY, POPULATION


149
0:21:24,23 --> 0:21:35,67
2. IN POPULATION 1, IF THIS IS THE   ALLELE
FREQUENCY FOR A PARTICULAR GENE, IT'S BOUNCING


150
0:21:35,67 --> 0:21:42,96
   AROUND. POPULATION 2, MAYBE IT DOES THAT.
AGAIN,   BECAUSE THERE IS NO PARTICULAR


151
0:21:42,96 --> 0:21:48,409
DIRECTION TO THE   CHANGE.   SO NOW WE
CAN SEE HERE YOU HAVE LOST VARIATION,  


152
0:21:48,409 --> 0:21:56,86
 HERE YOU LOST VARIATION. BUT YOU HAVE GOT
DIFFERENT   ALLELES. THESE ARE NOW ALL B.


153
0:21:56,86 --> 0:22:6,179
THESE ARE ALL A.   SO IF YOU MIX THEM YOU
GET BACK THE GENETIC   VARIATION.  WE


154
0:22:6,179 --> 0:22:10,669
WILL COME BACK TO THIS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
   MIGRATION, WHICH I BELIEVE IS WHAT WE


155
0:22:10,669 --> 0:22:17,34
ARE COMING UP   TO.   OKAY, SO JUST TO
REVIEW GENETIC DRIFT, IT   ISPHENOMENON


156
0:22:17,34 --> 0:22:25,82
IN SMALL POPULATIONS. IT CAUSES RANDOM  
 CHANGES IN ALLELE FREQUENCY FROM ONE GENERATION


157
0:22:25,82 --> 0:22:30,789
TO THE   NEXT. IF THE POPULATION IS SMALL
ENOUGH OR THE   PROCESS GOES ON FOR LONG


158
0:22:30,789 --> 0:22:36,51
ENOUGH, IT WILL LEAD TO THE   LOSS OF GENETIC
VARIATION WITHIN POPULATIONS, BUT   MIGHT


159
0:22:36,51 --> 0:22:45,4
INCREASE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POPULATIONS,
IF THE   POPULATIONS ARE ISOLATED.   


160
0:22:45,4 --> 0:22:51,46
ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE THIS IS IMPORTANT, THAT
IS   SORT OF CONSERVATION BIOLOGY THING.


161
0:22:51,46 --> 0:23:3,159
ANOTHER EXAMPLE   IS COLONIZATION. SO, AS
WE WILL SEE LATER IN THE   COURSE, THE MODERN


162
0:23:3,159 --> 0:23:10,349
HUMAN SPECIES, HOMOSAPIANS, AROSE   IN AFRICA.
IT APPEARS ABOUT 100, 150 THOUSAND YEARS 


163
0:23:10,349 --> 0:23:18,11
  AGO A RELATIVELY SMALL SAMPLE OF AFRICANS
COLONIZED   INTO EUROPE, AND SOME ACROSS


164
0:23:18,11 --> 0:23:24,909
SOUTH ASIA INTO AUSTRALIA  AND BEYOND. SO
WE TOOK A SMALL SAMPLE OUT OF THAT BIG  


165
0:23:24,909 --> 0:23:31,36
 AFRICAN POPULATION AND WHAT WE SEE TODAY
THERE IS FAR   MORE GENETIC DIVERSITY AMONGST


166
0:23:31,36 --> 0:23:38,59
AFRICANS THAN THERE IS   AMONG CAUCASIANS
AND EUROPEANS. THERE WAS A LOSS OF   GENETIC


167
0:23:38,59 --> 0:23:44,429
DIVERSITY WITH THAT NATURAL COLONIZATION.
THE   SAME IS TRUE OF ISLANDS. SO, HUMANS


168
0:23:44,429 --> 0:23:58,22
COMING OUT OF   AFRICA FROM ISLANDS, REMEMBER
THE DARWIN FEATURES FROM   THE GALAPAGOS.


169
0:23:58,22 --> 0:24:4,149
THEY STEM FROM A SINGLE ANCESTOR OR   A
SMALL NUMBER OF ANCESTORS THAT COLONIZED THE


170
0:24:4,149 --> 0:24:12,2
   GALAPAGOS SUCCESSFULLY FROM MAINLAND
SOUTH AFRICA. IN   NATURE, WHAT WE SEE IN


171
0:24:12,2 --> 0:24:16,5
ISLANDS IS THAT THERE IS A LOT   OF SHIFT,
VERY RAPID CHANGES IN MORPHOLOGY AND   


172
0:24:16,5 --> 0:24:21,86
PHENOTYPES AND IN GENETIC VARIATION. PERHAPS
   ASSOCIATED WITH THIS COLONIZATION PROCESS.


173
0:24:21,86 --> 0:24:36,57
   THIS IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS A FOUNDER
   EVENT.   AND FIGURES OF THIS CAN CONTRIBUTE


174
0:24:36,57 --> 0:24:44,38
TO THIS   INITIAL SAMPLING, PERHAPS WITH
LATER POPULATION  GROWTH, CAN CAUSE VERY


175
0:24:44,38 --> 0:24:49,429
RAPID CHANGES IN THE GENETIC   MAKE-UP OF
POPULATIONS. PERHAPS EVEN GENERATE NOVEL 


176
0:24:49,429 --> 0:24:58,72
  PHENOTYPES OR NOVEL COMBINATIONS OF GENES
THAT MIGHT   BE FAVORED IN THE NEW ENVIRONMENT


177
0:24:58,72 --> 0:25:15,7
OR NOT.   OKAY. SO WE WILL TALK NOW ABOUT
MUTATION. ARE   YOU ALL OKAY WITH GENETIC


178
0:25:15,7 --> 0:25:16,799
DRIFT? THE SAMPLING   PROCESS? OKAY. ANY
QUESTIONS? SO, ANOTHER   ASSUMPTION OF HARDY-WEINBERG,


179
0:25:16,799 --> 0:25:17,899
ONE THAT TURNS OUT NOT   TO MATTER VERY
MUCH IN THE CONTEXT OF HARDY-WEINBERG  


180
0:25:17,899 --> 0:25:20,27
 IS A MUTATION. SO, LET'S LOOK AT THE PROCESS
OF   MUTATION. HERE WE GET TO SEE HOW GENTLE


181
0:25:20,27 --> 0:25:20,799
I CAN BE. SO   IF I TAKE THIS SMALL SAMPLE
OF THE TOTAL CLASS HOW   MANY PEOPLE HAVE


182
0:25:20,799 --> 0:25:21,26
NOT TAKEN ANY MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AT   ANY
STAGE? OKAY. I WILL BE GENTLE. I AM SURE YOU


183
0:25:21,26 --> 0:25:21,419
   HAVE THAT PLEASURE AHEAD OF YOU.


184
0:25:21,419 --> 0:25:21,77
SO I WANT TO TALK NOW ABOUT MUTATION. ARE
YOU ALL OKAY WITH


185
0:25:21,77 --> 0:25:22,2
GENETIC DRIFT? THE SAMPLING THE PROCESS? OKAY.
ANY QUESTIONS?


186
0:25:22,2 --> 0:25:26,789
SO, ANOTHER ASSUMPTION OF HOW THEY, ONE THAT
TURNS OUT NOT TO


187
0:25:26,789 --> 0:25:32,919
MATTER VERY MUCH IN THE CONTEXT OF HARDY-WEINBURG
IS MUTATION.


188
0:25:32,919 --> 0:25:36,1
SO LET'S LOOK AT THE PROCESS OF MUTATION.


189
0:25:36,1 --> 0:25:46,289
HERE AGAIN I'LL NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW GENTLE
I CAN BE. IF


190
0:25:46,289 --> 0:25:51,96
I TAKE THIS SMALLISH SAMPLE OF THE TOTAL CLASS,
HOW MANY PEOPLE


191
0:25:51,96 --> 0:25:54,95
HAVE TAKEN ANY MOLECULAR -- HOW MANY PEOPLE
HAVE NOT TAKEN ANY


192
0:25:54,95 --> 0:26:1,96
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AT ANY STAGE? OKAY. I'LL
BE GENTLE.


193
0:26:1,96 --> 0:26:7,279
I'M SURE YOU HAVE THAT PLEASURE AHEAD OF YOU.
SO LET'S LOOK


194
0:26:7,279 --> 0:26:14,45
AT MUTATION.


195
0:26:14,45 --> 0:26:18,19
MUTATION, THAT IS, CHANGES IN THE GENOME OR
THE


196
0:26:18,19 --> 0:26:27,779
NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE. IT IS SORT OF THE ULTIMATE
SOURCE OF


197
0:26:27,779 --> 0:26:35,62
VARIATION. WITH THAT MUTATION ALL GENES IN
THE POPULATION WOULD


198
0:26:35,62 --> 0:26:40,74
JUST HAVE THE SAME SET OF ALLELES. YOU ARE
GOING TO GENERATE NEW


199
0:26:40,74 --> 0:26:44,96
VARIANCES OF ALLELES. AND THAT PROCESS THAT
GENERATES THAT IS


200
0:26:44,96 --> 0:26:49,0
MUTATION.


201
0:26:49,0 --> 0:26:53,49
SO, IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SLIDE FIVE AND SUMMARIZE
SOME OF


202
0:26:53,49 --> 0:26:58,57
THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF MUTATION THAT CAN OCCUR
AT THE LEVEL OF


203
0:26:58,57 --> 0:27:0,59
GENES OR THEIR CONTROLLING ELEMENTS.


204
0:27:0,59 --> 0:27:7,0
SO ONE TYPE OF MUTATION THAT CAN OCCUR IS
A CHANGE IN THE


205
0:27:7,0 --> 0:27:17,38
CODING SEQUENCE.


206
0:27:17,38 --> 0:27:18,65
WHAT DO I MEAN BY CODING SEQUENCE?


207
0:27:18,65 --> 0:27:32,779
SO EUKARYOTES IN GENERAL, A SORT OF CARTOON
FORM. A GENE


208
0:27:32,779 --> 0:27:45,85
MIGHT BE STRUCTURED SOMETHING LIKE THIS. WE
HAVE EXONS AND THE


209
0:27:45,85 --> 0:27:55,309
INTRONS. IT'S THE EXONS, THE WHOLE THING IS
TRANSCRIBED IN THE


210
0:27:55,309 --> 0:28:2,799
MESSENGER RNA AND THEN THE INTRONS ARE CUT
OUT. WHAT YOU


211
0:28:2,799 --> 0:28:11,299
 EVENTUALLY END UP WITH IS THE MESSENGER
RNA THAT IS TRANSCRIBED.


212
0:28:11,299 --> 0:28:16,2
THE INTRONS ARE CUT OUT. SO THE MESSENGER
RNA REPRESENTS WHAT'S


213
0:28:16,2 --> 0:28:24,799
IN THE EXONS. THIS THEN GOES THROUGH TRANSLATION
TO FORM THE


214
0:28:24,799 --> 0:28:32,71
PROTEIN.


215
0:28:32,71 --> 0:28:37,679
ELSEWHERE, YOU MIGHT HAVE AND THAT COULD BE
QUITE DISTANT


216
0:28:37,679 --> 0:28:43,11
FROM THIS GENE, YOU'LL HAVE SEQUENCES THAT
CONTROL GENE


217
0:28:43,11 --> 0:28:49,7
REGULATION.


218
0:28:49,7 --> 0:28:52,23
PLAYS WITH THE ENZYMES THAT TRANSCRIBE THE
DNA AND


219
0:28:52,23 --> 0:28:58,48
THOSE COMPLEXES WILL BIND TO DETERMINE HOW
MUCH, WHERE AND WHEN


220
0:28:58,48 --> 0:29:1,309
THIS PARTICULAR GENE IS EXPRESSED. THAT IS,
TRANSCRIBED AND


221
0:29:1,309 --> 0:29:5,0
TRANSLATED TO MESSENGER RNA. THERE IS A LOT
OF STUFF GOING ON AS


222
0:29:5,0 --> 0:29:8,32
WELL, BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR
NOW.


223
0:29:8,32 --> 0:29:16,169
SO WITHIN THESE EXONS, YOU BLOW THIS UP. YOU
GET A SEQUENCE


224
0:29:16,169 --> 0:29:27,51
OF NUCLEOTIDES WHICH COME IN THREE'S, WHICH
ARE CALLED CODONS.


225
0:29:27,51 --> 0:29:30,75
AND THESE FORM THE PARTICULAR CODE. PARTICULAR
CODONS SPECIFY


226
0:29:30,75 --> 0:29:36,23
PARTICULAR AMINO ACIDS IN THE PROTEIN. OKAY.
YOU ALL WITH ME ON


227
0:29:36,23 --> 0:29:40,919
THAT? A LOT OF REALLY COOL STUFF GOING ON
BESIDE THIS BUT THAT


228
0:29:40,919 --> 0:29:42,35
WILL DO FOR NOW.


229
0:29:42,35 --> 0:29:46,299
WHEN I REFER TO A CHANGE IN THE CODING SEQUENCE,
I'M


230
0:29:46,299 --> 0:29:50,899
REFERRING TO A CHANGE IN THE EXONS AND ONE
IN WHICH PERHAPS


231
0:29:50,899 --> 0:29:55,809
CHANGES WHICH AMINO ACID IS ENCODED IN THAT
PROTEIN THAT'S


232
0:29:55,809 --> 0:30:0,26
PRODUCED. AN EXAMPLE SHOWN THERE IS FOR THE
HEMOGLOBIN OR THE


233
0:30:0,26 --> 0:30:5,82
BETA-GLOBIN GENE IN HEMOGLOBIN. IN THAT SLIDE
REMEMBER WE TALKED


234
0:30:5,82 --> 0:30:12,62
ABOUT HEMOGLOBIN A AND B? HBBA, HBBS, IN THE
LAST LECTURE THE


235
0:30:12,62 --> 0:30:18,77
SICKLE CELL MUTATION. THAT'S DUE TO A CHANGE
IN THE CODING


236
0:30:18,77 --> 0:30:28,68
SEQUENCE FROM, IN A PARTICULAR CODON FROM
CCT TO CAT. YOU'VE


237
0:30:28,68 --> 0:30:37,22
 CHANGED FROM A "T" TO AN "A" THERE. WHICH
CHANGES THE PARTICULAR


238
0:30:37,22 --> 0:30:43,659
AMINO ACID CODE IN THAT PROTEIN WHICH GIVES
RISE TO THE DISTINCT


239
0:30:43,659 --> 0:30:49,909
PHENOTYPE. THAT IS A CHANGE IN A CODING SEQUENCE.


240
0:30:49,909 --> 0:30:59,37
YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE REGULATORY SEQUENCES.
SO THIS STUFF.


241
0:30:59,37 --> 0:31:6,98
IT IS A MUTATION THAT'S GOING TO OCCUR IN
THE DNA THERE THAT WILL


242
0:31:6,98 --> 0:31:12,6
CHANGE THE EXTENT, THE TIMING OR THE PLACE
OF GENE EXPRESSION,


243
0:31:12,6 --> 0:31:18,98
WHICH CAN MATTER A WHOLE LOT.


244
0:31:18,98 --> 0:31:25,399
OKAY? SO IN HEMOGLOBIN, FOR EXAMPLE, DIFFERENT
GLOBIN GENES


245
0:31:25,399 --> 0:31:29,12
ARE EXPRESSED AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT.
THEY ARE


246
0:31:29,12 --> 0:31:32,29
EXPRESSED IN PARTICULAR TISSUES TO FORM THE
HEMOGLOBIN, ET


247
0:31:32,29 --> 0:31:41,69
CETERA, ET CETERA.


248
0:31:41,69 --> 0:31:44,559
WE CAN ALSO CHANGE THE NUMBER OF COPIES OF
GENES IN THE


249
0:31:44,559 --> 0:31:48,8
GENOME. WE ARE JUST NOW STARTING TO SEE HOW
VERY COMMON THIS IS.


250
0:31:48,8 --> 0:32:2,63
SO THESE ARE SO-CALLED COPY NUMBER VARIANCE.
SO GENES CAN


251
0:32:2,63 --> 0:32:6,13
BE -- EXTRA COPIES CAN BE MADE OF GENES THROUGH
ERRORS IN


252
0:32:6,13 --> 0:32:13,49
REPLICATION OR ERRORS IN RECOMBINATION OR
BY MOBILE ELEMENTS


253
0:32:13,49 --> 0:32:16,529
TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS. A WHOLE VARIETY OF
MECHANISMS. YOU CAN


254
0:32:16,529 --> 0:32:20,88
CHANGE THE NUMBER OF COPIES OF GENES. THAT
AGAIN CAN EFFECT THE


255
0:32:20,88 --> 0:32:24,429
PHENOTYPE. THE FACT THAT IT'S TURNING OUT
TO BE QUITE A COMMON


256
0:32:24,429 --> 0:32:30,9
CAUSE OF DIFFERENCES IN A WHOLE NUMBER OF
HUMAN TRAITS, DISEASES


257
0:32:30,9 --> 0:32:33,39
AND SO FORTH. CHANGES IN THE COPY NUMBER OF
GENES, NOT THEIR


258
0:32:33,39 --> 0:32:36,779
INTERNAL STRUCTURE. AND PARTICULAR PARTS OF
GENOME DO THIS A


259
0:32:36,779 --> 0:32:41,94
WHOLE LOT AND OTHER PARTS ARE ALL STABLE.
IT IS SOMETHING THAT


260
0:32:41,94 --> 0:32:45,69
ONLY NOW THEY ARE ABLE TO ASSESS ACCURATELY
IN HUMAN POPULATIONS.


261
0:32:45,69 --> 0:32:59,73
AND FINALLY YOU CAN CHANGE GENOME ORGANIZATION.
MAYBE EVEN


262
0:32:59,73 --> 0:33:10,84
 DUPLICATE THE WHOLE GENOME. QUITE COMMON
IN PLANTS.
THAT IS,


263
0:33:10,84 --> 0:33:17,899
YOU CAN CREATE POLYPLOIDS. SO DIPLOID TO TETRAPLOID.
COPY THE


264
0:33:17,899 --> 0:33:23,769
WHOLE GENOME. AND THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE
TIMES IN CERTAINLY


265
0:33:23,769 --> 0:33:28,899
THE EVOLUTION OF VERTEBRATES AND OTHER ORGANISMS.
IN FACT, IN


266
0:33:28,899 --> 0:33:34,83
INDIVIDUAL SALMONA CELLS YOU GET DIFFERENT
PLOIDY LEVELS. FOR


267
0:33:34,83 --> 0:33:38,789
THE WHOLE SALMON FAMILY IN GENERAL THEY HAVE
COPIED THEIR WHOLE


268
0:33:38,789 --> 0:33:43,49
GENOME AND THEN GENES HAVE DIVERSIFIED AMONG
THOSE COPIES.


269
0:33:43,49 --> 0:33:50,14
OKAY. SO THESE -- OR YOU CAN CHANGE THE ORGANIZATION
OF


270
0:33:50,14 --> 0:33:53,51
CHROMOSOMES, YOU CAN FUSE CHROMOSOMES TOGETHER
OR BITS CAN BREAK


271
0:33:53,51 --> 0:33:57,919
OFF AND JOIN ANOTHER CHROMOSOME. SO ALL THESE
ARE FORMS OF


272
0:33:57,919 --> 0:34:2,64
MUTATION THAT ARISE MOSTLY THROUGH ERRORS
IN REPLICATION,


273
0:34:2,64 --> 0:34:7,6
RECOMBINATION OR THE ACTION OF TRANSPOSABLE
ELEMENTS OR MOBILE


274
0:34:7,6 --> 0:34:17,4
ELEMENTS IN THE GENOME.


275
0:34:17,4 --> 0:34:20,79
HOW COMMON IS THIS? WELL, PEOPLE HAVE TRIED
TO FIGURE THIS


276
0:34:20,79 --> 0:34:39,48
OUT FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT'S THE FREQUENCY
OF MUTATION? SO JUST


277
0:34:39,48 --> 0:34:42,48
RECENTLY A FEW WEEKS AGO THERE WAS A REPORT
OF COMPLETE GENOME


278
0:34:42,48 --> 0:34:46,78
SEQUENCING OF MULTIPLE FAMILIES. BOTH PARENTS,
BIOLOGICAL


279
0:34:46,78 --> 0:34:50,73
PARENTS, OF COURSE, AND THEIR OFFSPRING, AND
I DID THIS FOR THE


280
0:34:50,73 --> 0:34:54,48
WHOLE FAMILIES. SO I COMPARED THE WHOLE GENOME
BETWEEN PARENTS


281
0:34:54,48 --> 0:34:59,91
AND OFFSPRING TO IDENTIFY CHANGES, ALLELES
IN THE OFFSPRING BUT


282
0:34:59,91 --> 0:35:6,16
NOT THE PARENTS. THE CONCLUSION FROM THAT
IS THAT THE MUTATION


283
0:35:6,16 --> 0:35:18,66
RATE IS ROUGHLY 10 TO THE MINUS 8 PER NUCLEOTIDE
PER GENERATION.


284
0:35:18,66 --> 0:35:28,15
10 TO THE MINUS 8 IS A TINY LITTLE NUMBER.
ONE IN 100 MILLION.


285
0:35:28,15 --> 0:35:33,13
BUT THINK ABOUT HOW MANY NUCLEOTIDES YOU HAVE
IN YOUR GENOME.


286
0:35:33,13 --> 0:35:45,36
THE GENOME IS APPROXIMATELY 3 BY 10 TO THE
9 BASE PAIRS IN


287
0:35:45,36 --> 0:35:51,5
 HUMANS. SO MULTIPLY IT OUT. HERE IS THE
RATE PER NUCLEOTIDE PER


288
0:35:51,5 --> 0:35:58,329
GENERATION. HERE'S THE NUMBER OF NUCLEOTIDES.
SO THE NUMBER OF


289
0:35:58,329 --> 0:36:5,44
NEW MUTATIONS ACROSS THE WHOLE GENOME IN A
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL


290
0:36:5,44 --> 0:36:15,92
CAN BE ROUGHLY 30. EACH OF US IS A MUTANT.
AND WE SHOULD


291
0:36:15,92 --> 0:36:22,26
CELEBRATE THAT. IT IS THE ULTIMATE CAUSE OF
HUMAN DIVERSITY.


292
0:36:22,26 --> 0:36:24,88
SO, ON AVERAGE THERE IS A LOT OF VARIATION
IN THIS NUMBER.


293
0:36:24,88 --> 0:36:30,74
YOU ARE GOING TO CARRY SOME TENS OF CHANGES
IN YOUR DNA SEQUENCE


294
0:36:30,74 --> 0:36:36,53
COMPARED TO YOUR PARENTS. I THINK THAT'S COOL.
NOW, DO THESE


295
0:36:36,53 --> 0:36:44,3
MATTER? MOST OF THE GENOME ISN'T IN THESE
BITS. MOST OF IT'S IN


296
0:36:44,3 --> 0:36:48,95
THE CHUNKS OF DNA BETWEEN GENES. NOW, SOME
OF THIS MATTERS IN


297
0:36:48,95 --> 0:36:54,54
WAYS WE DON'T YET UNDERSTAND. PERHAPS IN GENE
REGULATION, SO AND


298
0:36:54,54 --> 0:37:0,8
SO FORTH. SO MOST OF THESE CHANGES PROBABLY
AREN'T LANDING IN


299
0:37:0,8 --> 0:37:8,3
EXON OR IN ARTIFACT GENE REGULATION BUT SOME
DO. SOME SMALL


300
0:37:8,3 --> 0:37:15,869
PROPORTION OF THOSE WILL. SO, WHY DO WE ALL
HAVE TEN


301
0:37:15,869 --> 0:37:22,93
FINGERS -- SORRY. 11 FINGERS? SO ON AND SO
FORTH. THESE ARE


302
0:37:22,93 --> 0:37:25,81
MOSTLY HETEROZYGOTES. WE'RE NEARLY ALL HETEROZYGOTES.
BECAUSE


303
0:37:25,81 --> 0:37:29,53
IT'S A UNIQUE MUTATION. IT IS LANDING RANDOM
SOMEWHERE IN THIS


304
0:37:29,53 --> 0:37:35,2
WHOPPING BIG GENOME. SO THE CHANCE OF THAT
SAME MUTATION


305
0:37:35,2 --> 0:37:39,619
OCCURRING WHEN YOUR MOM MADE THE EGGS AND
YOUR DAD MADE THE SPERM


306
0:37:39,619 --> 0:37:47,6
HITTING THE SAME PLACE IS VANISHINGLY SMALL.
SO THESE ARE


307
0:37:47,6 --> 0:37:56,3
ESSENTIALLY ORGAN B HETEROZYGOTES AND MOSTLY
RECESSIVE. THAT IS,


308
0:37:56,3 --> 0:37:59,839
PARTICULARLY IF IT'S A MUTATION THAT KNOCKS
OUT A FUNCTION. OR A


309
0:37:59,839 --> 0:38:1,77
LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER
COPIED AND IT IS


310
0:38:1,77 --> 0:38:12,79
FUNCTIONAL, YOU'RE OKAY.


311
0:38:12,79 --> 0:38:15,32
SO, ALTHOUGH WE ALL CARRY MUTATIONS, WE STILL
FUNCTION


312
0:38:15,32 --> 0:38:24,65
 PRETTY WELL AS ORGANISMS. NOW, THERE IS
ONE LITTLE DANGER HERE.


313
0:38:24,65 --> 0:38:32,69
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU MATE WITH A CLOSE RELATIVE?
INBREEDING.


314
0:38:32,69 --> 0:38:39,99
RIGHT? MATING WITH CLOSE RELATIVES WITHIN
FAMILIES CAN BRING


315
0:38:39,99 --> 0:38:44,32
THESE OTHERWISE RARE MUTATIONS TOGETHER. IF
THE SAME MUTATION


316
0:38:44,32 --> 0:38:47,95
HAPPENS TO BE SHARED ACROSS GENERATIONS BECAUSE
THESE WILL


317
0:38:47,95 --> 0:38:54,2
ACCUMULATE ACROSS GENERATIONS, AND YOU'RE
MATING WITH A BROTHER,


318
0:38:54,2 --> 0:39:0,369
SISTER OR FATHER OR WHATEVER, THEN YOU MIGHT
BRING THESE,


319
0:39:0,369 --> 0:39:3,81
OTHERWISE, VERY RARE MUTATIONS TOGETHER IN
THE SAME OFFSPRING,


320
0:39:3,81 --> 0:39:7,41
WHICH IS BAD.


321
0:39:7,41 --> 0:39:11,18
BECAUSE THEN THEY'RE EXPRESSED. THEIR HOMOZYGOUS
AND IF IT


322
0:39:11,18 --> 0:39:15,48
IS A KNOCKOUT MUTATION OR SOMETHING THAT CAUSES
DAMAGE TO THE


323
0:39:15,48 --> 0:39:22,13
PHENOTYPE, IT WON'T BE REAL GOOD. SO, JUST
DON'T INBREED IS MY


324
0:39:22,13 --> 0:39:27,369
ADVISE. TURNS OUT DARWIN MARRIED HIS COUSIN,
WHICH IS REALLY


325
0:39:27,369 --> 0:39:31,839
COMMON IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND. AND SOME SOCIETIES
DO PRACTICE IN


326
0:39:31,839 --> 0:39:38,17
BREEDING. BUT THERE IT IS. THAT IS WHY IN
PART INBREEDING IS


327
0:39:38,17 --> 0:39:38,9
SUCH A BAD THING.


328
0:39:38,9 --> 0:39:48,2
OKAY. SO, IN SLIDE 6 I SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE
OF THESE


329
0:39:48,2 --> 0:39:51,0
DIFFERENT FORMS OF MUTATION THAT ACTUALLY
RELATES TO CODE COLOR


330
0:39:51,0 --> 0:39:56,65
IN MICE, WHICH YOU WILL BE STUDYING IN THE
LAB. SO ON THE LEFT


331
0:39:56,65 --> 0:40:2,79
IS A NORMAL SORT OF MOUSE. ON THE RIGHT IS
A DARK MOUSE, IN


332
0:40:2,79 --> 0:40:5,45
SLIDE 6.


333
0:40:5,45 --> 0:40:8,26
SO TURNS OUT THESE MUTATIONS CAN ARISE THIS
PARTICULAR


334
0:40:8,26 --> 0:40:12,54
PHENOTYPE WHICH TURNS UP AGAIN AND AGAIN ON
LAVA FLOWS. THE NEXT


335
0:40:12,54 --> 0:40:23,29
LECTURE I WILL BRING YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF
THESE ANIMALS. YES?


336
0:40:23,29 --> 0:40:27,53
YES. EXACTLY. SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS. SO
IF THE


337
0:40:27,53 --> 0:40:32,97
 MUTATION CAUSE AN INCREASE IN SURVIVAL OR
INCREASE IN


338
0:40:32,97 --> 0:40:35,69
REPRODUCTION, THEN IT WILL BE FAVORED BY SELECTION
AND IT WILL


339
0:40:35,69 --> 0:40:44,609
INCREASE IN THE POPULATION. OKAY? THAT'S ABSOLUTELY
CORRECT.


340
0:40:44,609 --> 0:40:46,92
YES, BUT IT TAKES MUCH LONGER. WE ARE GOING
TO TALK ABOUT


341
0:40:46,92 --> 0:40:50,53
THAT IN THE LECTURE ON FRIDAY. NEW MUTATIONS
COME IN. THEY MAY


342
0:40:50,53 --> 0:40:55,97
HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE PHENOTYPE BECAUSE THERE
IS SOME IN THE DNA


343
0:40:55,97 --> 0:41:0,17
THAT LITERALLY HAS NO EFFECT. BUT MIGHT HAVE
AN EFFECT BUT BE


344
0:41:0,17 --> 0:41:5,31
RECESSIVE AND MIGHT HAVE AN EFFECT AND BE
DOMINANT. AND THAT


345
0:41:5,31 --> 0:41:9,16
REALLY CHANGES HOW THE WHOLE DYNAMIC GOES
FROM THERE IN TERMS OF


346
0:41:9,16 --> 0:41:12,44
WHETHER IT'S FAVORED BY SELECTION. MAYBE LOST
BY GENETIC DRIFT.


347
0:41:12,44 --> 0:41:18,28
REMEMBER IT WAS A DRIFT THING. IF YOU START
DOWN HERE AT A VERY


348
0:41:18,28 --> 0:41:22,47
LOW ALLELE FREQUENCY, A NEW MUTATION, THERE
IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT


349
0:41:22,47 --> 0:41:27,46
WILL ACTUALLY BE LOST. UNDER GENETIC DRIFT
GOING INTO THE NEXT


350
0:41:27,46 --> 0:41:29,38
GENERATION YOU WILL FAIL TO PICK UP THAT EXCEPTIONALLY
RARE


351
0:41:29,38 --> 0:41:33,869
MUTATION IN AN OFFSPRING IN THE NEXT GENERATION
IN SORT OF MODEL


352
0:41:33,869 --> 0:41:38,5
SIZE POPULATIONS. SO IT IS REALLY INTERESTING
TO THINK ABOUT


353
0:41:38,5 --> 0:41:40,43
WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE FATE OF THIS MUTATION.
A LOT OF TIMES


354
0:41:40,43 --> 0:41:44,81
THEY WILL JUST BE LOST. WE'LL FAIL TO GET
THEM IN THE NEXT


355
0:41:44,81 --> 0:41:48,79
GENERATION. IF THEY ARE FAVORED BY SELECTION
THEN HOW QUICKLY


356
0:41:48,79 --> 0:41:53,43
THEY INCREASE WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER THEY
ARE RECESSIVE OR NOT.


357
0:41:53,43 --> 0:41:56,8
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. THAT IS A GOOD
QUESTION. ANY OTHER


358
0:41:56,8 --> 0:41:57,18
QUESTIONS?


359
0:41:57,18 --> 0:42:4,29
OKAY. WHERE WAS I? MICE. OKAY. SO THIS PARTICULAR


360
0:42:4,29 --> 0:42:7,93
EXAMPLE, AND AGAIN THE DETAILS OF THIS DON'T
MATTER. IT IS JUST


361
0:42:7,93 --> 0:42:14,48
ILLUSTRATING THESE DIFFERENT FORMS OF MUTATION.
IN THE MELANIN


362
0:42:14,48 --> 0:42:19,55
 PRODUCTION PATHWAY THE MELANIN IS WHAT MAKES
THESE MICE DARK.


363
0:42:19,55 --> 0:42:22,99
AND IS FAVORED BY SELECTION IF THEY'RE LIVING
ON LAVA FLOWS, FOR


364
0:42:22,99 --> 0:42:28,42
EXAMPLE. IT MAKES THEM LESS CONSPICUOUS TO
A PREDATOR.


365
0:42:28,42 --> 0:42:33,55
AND THAT PATHWAY, A LOT OF WHICH IS NOW KNOWN
FROM STUDIES


366
0:42:33,55 --> 0:42:40,15
OF MICE, YOU'VE GOT A CELL, YOU'VE GOT A RECEPTOR,
ON THE EDGE OF


367
0:42:40,15 --> 0:42:49,52
THAT CELL THAT WILL INTERACT WITH A HORMONE.
COMING AT THIS


368
0:42:49,52 --> 0:42:56,3
PARTICULAR RECEPTOR THE PROTEIN IS CALLED
MC1R, MELANOCORTIN


369
0:42:56,3 --> 0:43:3,849
RECEPTOR. OR WAS IT MC1R? YEAH, MC1R. SO A
CHANGE IN THE CODING


370
0:43:3,849 --> 0:43:9,46
SEQUENCE FOR THIS PROTEIN, IN THE DNA IN THE
EXONS, CAN CHANGE


371
0:43:9,46 --> 0:43:14,69
THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH IT RECOGNIZES THE
HORMONE AND THEN


372
0:43:14,69 --> 0:43:19,8
INITIATES EVENTS INSIDE THE CELL TO PRODUCE
MELANIN. DON'T WORRY


373
0:43:19,8 --> 0:43:25,41
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE.


374
0:43:25,41 --> 0:43:31,14
BUT IT ALSO INTERACTS. SO MSH HERE IS THE
HORMONE,


375
0:43:31,14 --> 0:43:40,42
MELANOCYTE STIMULATING HORMONE. SO THAT'S
AN EXAMPLE OF A CODING


376
0:43:40,42 --> 0:43:50,41
MUTATION. WE'VE CHANGED MC1R TO INTERACT WITH
THAT HORMONE. BUT


377
0:43:50,41 --> 0:44:0,8
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS FROM A DIFFERENT PROTEIN
CALLED A GUTI,


378
0:44:0,8 --> 0:44:8,119
WHICH SUPPRESSES THE ACTION OF MC1R. SO THIS
PROTEIN INTERACTS


379
0:44:8,119 --> 0:44:13,579
WITH THAT PROTEIN TO DETERMINE ITS FUNCTION.
AND THERE ARE NO


380
0:44:13,579 --> 0:44:18,2
MUTATIONS IN MELANISTIC MICE WHERE THE CODING
SEQUENCE OF THE


381
0:44:18,2 --> 0:44:20,69
GUTI IS NOT CHANGED, THE GENE REGULATION IS
CHANGED. THERE IS


382
0:44:20,69 --> 0:44:27,329
MORE OF IT. SORRY. THERE IS LESS OF IT. SO
WE'RE DECREASING A


383
0:44:27,329 --> 0:44:34,54
GUTI, WHICH IS REDUCING SUPPRESSION OF MC1R,
PRODUCING MORE


384
0:44:34,54 --> 0:44:40,8
MELANIN. SO THE CASE OF A GUTI, THIS IS A
REGULATORY MUTATION.


385
0:44:40,8 --> 0:44:44,89
THIS ONE IS A CODING SEQUENCE MUTATION. NOW,
THOSE TWO THINGS


386
0:44:44,89 --> 0:44:49,46
INTERACT, AND ONE OR THE OTHER CAN LEAD TO
THE CHANGE IN


387
0:44:49,46 --> 0:44:53,76
 PHENOTYPE. WE HAVE A SPECIFIC PHENOTYPE
CAUSED BY INDEPENDENT


388
0:44:53,76 --> 0:44:58,359
MUTATIONS. ONE BEING A REGULATORY MUTATION
IN A PARTICULAR


389
0:44:58,359 --> 0:45:1,44
PROTEIN AND OTHER BEING A CODING SEQUENCE
CHANGE IN A DIFFERENT


390
0:45:1,44 --> 0:45:7,319
PROTEIN WITH WHICH IT INTERACTS. EITHER ONE
CAN CAUSE THE CHANGE


391
0:45:7,319 --> 0:45:11,819
IN PHENOTYPE. ANY QUESTIONS? YES.


392
0:45:11,819 --> 0:45:15,16
NO, GUTI IS JUST A DIFFERENT GENE. IT IS A
GENE JUST LIKE


393
0:45:15,16 --> 0:45:19,89
THIS. BUT IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE THE MUTATION
IS ONE THAT


394
0:45:19,89 --> 0:45:23,97
EFFECTS ITS EXPRESSION, A CHANGE IN THE GENE
REGULATION. THE


395
0:45:23,97 --> 0:45:27,79
CODING SEQUENCE OF A GUTI IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A PALE MOUSE


396
0:45:27,79 --> 0:45:31,54
AND A DARK MOUSE. THE CHANGE OCCURRED IN THE
REGULATORY


397
0:45:31,54 --> 0:45:34,53
SEQUENCES. OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?


398
0:45:34,53 --> 0:45:42,55
OKAY. SO, AGAIN DON'T GET HUNG UP ON THE DETAILS
AND WHAT


399
0:45:42,55 --> 0:45:44,839
WAS THE NAME OF THAT HORMONE AND WHAT WAS
THE NAME OF THAT GENE.


400
0:45:44,839 --> 0:45:48,67
THE IDEAS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUTATIONS
EFFECTING PHENOTYPE.


401
0:45:48,67 --> 0:45:52,73
SOMETIMES GENERATING THE SAME TYPE OF PHENOTYPE
THROUGH A


402
0:45:52,73 --> 0:45:56,42
MECHANISM. OKAY.


403
0:45:56,42 --> 0:46:0,31
SO LET'S COME BACK TO THIS QUESTION. GENETIC
DRIFT. SO IN


404
0:46:0,31 --> 0:46:8,28
THE PRAIRIE CHICKEN I POINTED OUT THAT DIFFERENT
POPULATIONS ARE


405
0:46:8,28 --> 0:46:13,2
UNDERGOING GENETIC DRIFTING GENETICALLY. SOME
ARE FIXING, THAT


406
0:46:13,2 --> 0:46:16,4
IS, GOING TO ALL "A" AND SOME ARE GOING TO
ALL "B" AND SOME ARE


407
0:46:16,4 --> 0:46:20,5
STILL BOUNCING AROUND IN BETWEEN. SO EXPECT
GENETIC DRIFT TO


408
0:46:20,5 --> 0:46:25,93
INCREASE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POPULATIONS.


409
0:46:25,93 --> 0:46:41,7
SO ONE THING THAT IS OPPOSING IS MIGRATION,
WHICH YOU CAN


410
0:46:41,7 --> 0:46:56,91
ALSO THINK OF AS GENE FLOW. SO IF WE HAVE
A COUPLE OF


411
0:46:56,91 --> 0:47:1,97
POPULATIONS LIKE THIS, THIS 1P IS POINT "A"
AND THIS 1P IS POINT


412
0:47:1,97 --> 0:47:7,19
 TWO. THEY DIFFER IN THIS CASE BECAUSE OF
GENETIC DRIFT OPERATING


413
0:47:7,19 --> 0:47:13,89
IN THOSE TWO POPULATIONS. IF INDIVIDUALS ARE
BORN HERE AND MOVE


414
0:47:13,89 --> 0:47:18,869
OVER HERE TO REPRODUCE, IT IS ESSENTIAL THEY
REPRODUCE FOR


415
0:47:18,869 --> 0:47:22,72
MIGRATION TO GIVE RISE TO GENE FLOW. IF THEY
ARE BORN IN ONE


416
0:47:22,72 --> 0:47:26,15
POPULATION AND REPRODUCE IN ANOTHER, THEY
CARRY THEIR GENES FROM


417
0:47:26,15 --> 0:47:29,3
HERE TO HERE.


418
0:47:29,3 --> 0:47:37,109
THINK OF VIKINGS, SAILING FROM SCANDINAVIA
TO SCOTLAND AND


419
0:47:37,109 --> 0:47:40,309
ENGLAND AND SO FORTH AND GENEROUSLY SHARING
THEIR GENES AS THEY


420
0:47:40,309 --> 0:47:43,71
WENT.


421
0:47:43,71 --> 0:47:56,829
THAT'S GENE FLOW. OKAY. SO THE EFFECT OF THAT
IS TO REDUCE


422
0:47:56,829 --> 0:48:17,829
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POPULATIONS. IT OPPOSES
GENETIC DRIFT. IT


423
0:48:17,829 --> 0:48:20,63
CAN EVEN OPPOSE LOCAL ADAPTATION. WE'LL TALK
MORE ABOUT THAT


424
0:48:20,63 --> 0:48:27,69
LATER.


425
0:48:27,69 --> 0:48:30,67
THAT IS, IF ONE ALLELE IS FAVORED BY A SELECTION
HERE AND


426
0:48:30,67 --> 0:48:34,22
ANOTHER ALLELE IS FAVORED BY SELECTION HERE,
THEN THESE MIGRANTS


427
0:48:34,22 --> 0:48:37,69
COME ACROSS CARRYING THE WRONG ALLELE WILL
SLOW DOWN THAT


428
0:48:37,69 --> 0:48:40,99
RESPONSE TO SELECTION.


429
0:48:40,99 --> 0:48:52,66
FINALLY, IT SPREADS MUTATIONS THROUGH THE
SPECIES RANGE.


430
0:48:52,66 --> 0:49:12,3
SO, SHOWING YOU AN EXAMPLE THERE ON THE SLIDE,
SLIDE 7. AND


431
0:49:12,3 --> 0:49:18,95
THESE ARE MEASUREMENTS OF PARTICULAR ALLELES
BETWEEN TWO VERY


432
0:49:18,95 --> 0:49:22,53
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS.


433
0:49:22,53 --> 0:49:27,2
HEAVILY POLLUTED SITE WITH HEAVY METALS, A
MINING SITE WHERE


434
0:49:27,2 --> 0:49:30,68
A PARTICULAR PHENOTYPE AND GENE IS FAVORED.
IN AN ADJACENT


435
0:49:30,68 --> 0:49:35,39
NONCONTAMINATED PASTURE WE SEE SOME OF THE
ALLELES THAT ARE


436
0:49:35,39 --> 0:49:40,8
ADVANTAGEOUS HERE YET THEY NOT ADVANTAGEOUS
HERE YET THEY OCCUR


437
0:49:40,8 --> 0:49:40,91
 THERE.


438
0:49:40,91 --> 0:49:46,559
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS MIGRATION. BORN
IN ONE PLACE OR


439
0:49:46,559 --> 0:49:50,75
GAMETTES PRODUCE IN ONE PLACE, ENDING UP FORMING
ZYGOTES OR


440
0:49:50,75 --> 0:49:53,94
REPRODUCING IN THE OTHER POPULATION.


441
0:49:53,94 --> 0:49:58,53
SO MIGRATION IS VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF
REDUCING THIS


442
0:49:58,53 --> 0:50:3,559
EFFECT, SPREADING THE MUTATIONS THAT CAN OPPOSE
LOCAL ADAPTATION.


443
0:50:3,559 --> 0:50:8,74
WE'LL COME TO THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SELECTION
IN THE NEXT


444
0:50:8,74 --> 0:50:11,19
LECTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


445
0:50:11,19 --> 0:50:12,97
REMINDER OFFICE HOURS NOW IN WHATEVER...


446
0:50:12,97 --> 0:52:12,97
