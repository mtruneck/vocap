JAKE PHELPS: If you treat
somebody with respect, and--


3
0:0:8,57 --> 0:0:11,53
a lot of people say that
I have no respect for--


4
0:0:11,53 --> 0:0:15,3
that I'm an asshole
or whatever.


5
0:0:15,3 --> 0:0:17,57
I'm just talking shit
all the time.


6
0:0:17,57 --> 0:0:20,28
I just say what's on my mind,
and I'm usually right.


7
0:0:20,28 --> 0:0:23,6
And I also found out the
secret to all of it.


8
0:0:23,6 --> 0:0:28,59
What drives people most insane
of all, is ignoring them.


9
0:0:28,59 --> 0:0:30,75
You ignore somebody, walk
right by them like

PATRICK O'DELL: All right,
welcome back to the show.


14
0:0:37,83 --> 0:0:40,21
This episode is about the editor
of Thrasher Magazine,


15
0:0:40,21 --> 0:0:41,58
Jake Phelps.


16
0:0:41,58 --> 0:0:45,58
One thing I always noticed with
Jake is everything he


17
0:0:45,58 --> 0:0:47,16
says is quotable.


18
0:0:47,16 --> 0:0:50,41
People love to tell you what
they think of Jake Phleps.


19
0:0:50,41 --> 0:0:52,2
But Jake also likes to
tell you what he


20
0:0:52,2 --> 0:0:54,83
thinks of most people.


21
0:0:54,83 --> 0:0:57,49
We're going to meet up with
him, cruise around SF.


22
0:0:57,49 --> 0:0:59,77
We're going to look
at some spots.


23
0:0:59,77 --> 0:1:2,18
And I hope you enjoy it.


24
0:1:2,18 --> 0:1:3,4
JAKE PHELPS: Look there's
a skateboard person.


25
0:1:3,4 --> 0:1:6,35
Look these kids are just skating
down the street, just


26
0:1:6,35 --> 0:1:8,33
skating street style.


27
0:1:8,33 --> 0:1:11,35
That's Errol Langdon he's one
of the skateboard dudes.


28
0:1:11,35 --> 0:1:13,53
Nice.


29
0:1:13,53 --> 0:1:15,19
Skating is big in SF.


30
0:1:15,19 --> 0:1:17,59
Big, big, big stuff.


31
0:1:17,59 --> 0:1:20,19
I'll take you up to
The Dish first.


32
0:1:20,19 --> 0:1:21,78
Did you see the original
skatepark, the


33
0:1:21,78 --> 0:1:23,78
San Francisco skatepark?


34
0:1:23,78 --> 0:1:27,78
Where we've had riots
up here before.


35
0:1:27,78 --> 0:1:28,78
It's been gnarly.


36
0:1:28,78 --> 0:1:32,85
Kids were all just skating
around here, and the kids came


37
0:1:32,85 --> 0:1:35,6
up over the hill in waves.


38
0:1:35,6 --> 0:1:39,42
And then there was just a
fucking free for all fight.


39
0:1:39,42 --> 0:1:41,52
People just getting fucking
whupped up on


40
0:1:41,52 --> 0:1:43,74
bottles, sticks, and shit.


41
0:1:43,74 --> 0:1:45,635
I took on a bunch of
kids here one time.


42
0:1:45,635 --> 0:1:46,87
These kids were waiting for
the bus right here.


43
0:1:46,87 --> 0:1:50,0
And I was skating down the
street with my fucking knee


44
0:1:50,0 --> 0:1:51,0

45
0:1:51,0 --> 0:1:52,62
They looked at me once, my
wheels were [INAUDIBLE], my


46
0:1:52,62 --> 0:1:53,145
bolts were rattling.


47
0:1:53,145 --> 0:1:58,3
They were like, fuck this dude,
let's fuck this dude up.


48
0:1:58,3 --> 0:2:1,77
They jumped me, broke
my glasses.


49
0:2:1,77 --> 0:2:5,17
It was just like a rap,
like Beastie Boys rap,


50
0:2:5,17 --> 0:2:6,1
or some bull shit.


51
0:2:6,1 --> 0:2:8,0
This is Phelps Street.


52
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:9,66
I gotta take you to this spot.


53
0:2:9,66 --> 0:2:12,7
Coco's name is carved in
the ground, [INAUDIBLE]


54
0:2:12,7 --> 0:2:13,13
is.


55
0:2:13,13 --> 0:2:14,565
He actually did that.


56

that's a trip.


58
0:2:18,42 --> 0:2:22,9
It says, Coco Santiago

59
0:2:22,9 --> 0:2:24,6
PATRICK O'DELL: What's
Coco doing right now?


60
0:2:24,6 --> 0:2:24,82
JAKE PHELPS: He's cooked.


61
0:2:24,82 --> 0:2:27,39
He's gone.


62
0:2:27,39 --> 0:2:30,78
His mother is the last-- his
mother, she was dying of


63
0:2:30,78 --> 0:2:33,33
fucking cancer.


64
0:2:33,33 --> 0:2:35,116
I happened to be there
at the hospital.


65
0:2:35,116 --> 0:2:37,7
Coco was there.


66
0:2:37,7 --> 0:2:40,652
She told me, she grabbed my arm,
dude she said, take care


67
0:2:40,652 --> 0:2:41,9
of Coco for me.


68
0:2:41,9 --> 0:2:45,46
I was like, I can hardly
take care of myself.


69
0:2:45,46 --> 0:2:47,2
And then she died.


70
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:50,41
Then Coco, after the night
the van got shot up.


71
0:2:50,41 --> 0:2:52,34
He got shot.


72
0:2:52,34 --> 0:2:57,84
And, he never came
back from that.


73
0:2:57,84 --> 0:3:0,9
I think he's heavily
medicated.


74
0:3:0,9 --> 0:3:1,42
He's a ward of the state.


75
0:3:1,42 --> 0:3:2,64
It's what I heard.


76
0:3:2,64 --> 0:3:4,6
I've seen him once or twice.


77
0:3:4,6 --> 0:3:9,61
He's got a really random giggle,
every time I see him.


78
0:3:9,61 --> 0:3:12,17

he goes, you coulda


79
0:3:12,17 --> 0:3:13,335
killed all your men?


80
0:3:13,335 --> 0:3:14,56
Let it go.


81
0:3:14,56 --> 0:3:16,98
He's got the knife to fucking
Brian Dennehy's neck.


82
0:3:16,98 --> 0:3:19,93
And he just says it
to him, let it go.


83
0:3:19,93 --> 0:3:21,64
And he just can't let it
go cause he's a man.


84
0:3:21,64 --> 0:3:24,5
And he's just like,
I can't do it.

one that Cardiel tried?

video I think.


93

He tried it fucking seriously,
maybe 40 times.

face, and the blood.

to where everyone skates.

0:7:51,87 --> 0:7:52,86
right on this corner.


208
0:7:52,86 --> 0:7:53,57
On that street.


209
0:7:53,57 --> 0:7:56,32
And as I picked it up, I was
like this is too fucking weird


210
0:7:56,32 --> 0:7:57,57
Just a picture.


211
0:7:57,57 --> 0:7:59,62



212
0:7:59,62 --> 0:8:3,0
Skating's, it's permeated
to everything I know.


213
0:8:3,0 --> 0:8:6,51
JERRY HSU: Well one thing about
Jake is I know that he


214
0:8:6,51 --> 0:8:8,11
really loves skateboarding.


215
0:8:8,11 --> 0:8:9,69
And it's his life.


216
0:8:9,69 --> 0:8:13,3
And I think that's, I think
that's really awesome.


217
0:8:13,3 --> 0:8:18,32
His whole life is skateboarding,
and he knows so


218
0:8:18,32 --> 0:8:19,53
much about skating.


219
0:8:19,53 --> 0:8:22,95
And I think that's
really cool.


220
0:8:22,95 --> 0:8:26,99
Because I'll see Jake,
and then he'll


221
0:8:26,99 --> 0:8:28,25
just throw all this--


222
0:8:28,25 --> 0:8:31,19
he'll just talk about all this
random stuff about skating,


223
0:8:31,19 --> 0:8:32,539
that I don't even know
anything about.


224
0:8:32,539 --> 0:8:35,2
But it's like, man I seriously
do not know how


225
0:8:35,2 --> 0:8:37,22
to talk about Jake.


226
0:8:37,22 --> 0:8:38,61
ROB WELSH: I love Phelps.


227
0:8:38,61 --> 0:8:39,48
He's sick.


228
0:8:39,48 --> 0:8:40,46
Is that what you
were gonna say?


229
0:8:40,46 --> 0:8:41,82
Yeah, I can read your mind.


230
0:8:41,82 --> 0:8:43,48
Jake Phelps is sick.


231
0:8:43,48 --> 0:8:47,962
He is a true Thrasher.

SONG LYRICS]


234
0:9:8,14 --> 0:9:22,92



235
0:9:22,92 --> 0:9:26,49
JAKE PHELPS: Then you go back
into the, this is the chorus.


236
0:9:26,49 --> 0:9:27,89
TONY TRUJILLO: I was
over my old band.


237
0:9:27,89 --> 0:9:35,1
And, we were on tour on the Burn
It Down tour in Europe


238
0:9:35,1 --> 0:9:35,96
with Anti Hero.


239
0:9:35,96 --> 0:9:38,164
And Jake was out there.


240
0:9:38,164 --> 0:9:43,3
And we just got to talking about
starting a stupid band.


241
0:9:43,3 --> 0:9:46,19
Cause he knew how to play
guitar, I guess.


242
0:9:46,19 --> 0:9:49,8
PATRICK O'DELL: How would
you describe Jake?


243
0:9:49,8 --> 0:9:52,14
TONY TRUJILLO: Oh, what day
is it Monday, or Friday?


244
0:9:52,14 --> 0:9:54,27
I don't know, it's
always different.


245
0:9:54,27 --> 0:9:55,71
Today he seems really happy.


246
0:9:55,71 --> 0:9:58,53
So that's good, but
it's hit and miss.


247
0:9:58,53 --> 0:9:59,91
I don't know.


248
0:9:59,91 --> 0:10:1,24
Cause he has all the mag shit.


249
0:10:1,24 --> 0:10:5,11
And he's got lots of people
breathing down his neck for


250
0:10:5,11 --> 0:10:7,325
the mag to get done.


251
0:10:7,325 --> 0:10:8,89
He comes over here,
he lets it out.


252
0:10:8,89 --> 0:10:13,35
And it's good for him, a
little stress reliever.


253
0:10:13,35 --> 0:10:14,76
JAKE PHELPS: Some people
don't like me.


254
0:10:14,76 --> 0:10:15,42
I don't like a lot of people.


255
0:10:15,42 --> 0:10:16,39
That's just the way it is.


256
0:10:16,39 --> 0:10:20,51
But the way that the functioning
magazine works is


257
0:10:20,51 --> 0:10:25,8
very different from the way
people understand it to be.


258
0:10:25,8 --> 0:10:27,31
That is the myth, that's
one of the mysteries of


259
0:10:27,31 --> 0:10:29,23
skateboarding, and
Thrasher itself.


260
0:10:29,23 --> 0:10:32,24
Is that people think that I
have a real hidden agenda.


261
0:10:32,24 --> 0:10:33,78
And I don't.


262
0:10:33,78 --> 0:10:37,1
There are some people that
I generally dislike.


263
0:10:37,1 --> 0:10:40,2
But that's for me, for
reasons of my own.


264
0:10:40,2 --> 0:10:41,96
But I don't go out of my way.


265
0:10:41,96 --> 0:10:43,59
If you skate, you skate.


266
0:10:43,59 --> 0:10:44,53
That's cool dude.


267
0:10:44,53 --> 0:10:46,64
Let the hippie ride,
I don't care.


268
0:10:46,64 --> 0:10:47,705
And it's part of what I do.


269
0:10:47,705 --> 0:10:48,54
It's my life.


270
0:10:48,54 --> 0:10:50,58
I gave my life to Thrasher.


271
0:10:50,58 --> 0:10:55,14
It wasn't something that I
had any plans on doing.


272
0:10:55,14 --> 0:10:56,51
I dropped out of school.


273
0:10:56,51 --> 0:10:59,53
I just started doing drugs and
fucking off, and skating.


274
0:10:59,53 --> 0:11:4,38
My mom told me, she's like do
what you like, and eventually


275
0:11:4,38 --> 0:11:5,62
it'll work out for you.


276
0:11:5,62 --> 0:11:7,304
That's about it.


277
0:11:7,304 --> 0:11:10,44
And the rest is fucking
history.


278
0:11:10,44 --> 0:11:14,6

for me is forever.

are so selfish to

0:11:31,71 --> 0:11:33,14
You care?


288
0:11:33,14 --> 0:11:34,54
She's just like you.


289
0:11:34,54 --> 0:11:37,24
She squats when she pisses.
