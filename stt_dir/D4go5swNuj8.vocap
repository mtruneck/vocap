###0 -This is a story about a man.
###5 This is a story of random violence and good times.
###12 ETHAN FOWLER: So I probably got to talk loud, right?
###14 -Yeah.
###14 ETHAN FOWLER: OK.
###15 All right, well, like a couple nights ago, the night before
###19 last, I went to The 500 Club with a couple friends.
###24 And I just decided to have a few drinks.
###26 It's a bar on Mission.
###28 And there, through I don't know how or
###34 why, I met this girl.
###35 A friend of mine said, cut the crap and why don't
###37 you just make out?
###38 So she says, all right let's make out.
###40 So we make out.
###41 And we're making out and everything's great.
###43 And we're hanging out and drinking.
###46 She got pissed because I saw this other
###49 girl and then we left.
###51 And the dudes pulled up and fucking jumped out of the car.
###56 Next thing I know, I just was getting socked in the face,
###58 looking at the guy like it's not going to do me any good
###61 punching him.
###63 And I got socked a few times.
###65 I fell.
###66 I just covered my face and they just kicked the shit out
###68 of me for a little while.
###70 It was good, though, because I got to make out with a girl.
###74 I don't know.
###76 
###78 It's getting purple.
###79 -OK.
###80 I'm going to fade it out.
###81 ETHAN FOWLER: OK.
###82 Fade.
###84 -Fade.
###85 ETHAN FOWLER: Fading fast.
###87 DAVE CARNIE: I don't really remember how the whole living
###89 thing came up.
###91 I got an apartment in the Mission.
###93 And he moved in with me.
###96 One day, went down to Guitar Center and bought a little,
###99 white Fender guitar, one of those $99 ones.
###103 And so that's what he'd do all day when I'd go to work.
###106 Is he'd just sit there and just noodle on the guitar.
###107 And every day I'd come home.
###110 He'd only been playing for like a week or two.
###113 And I came home one day and he had learned--
###115 he was like, Dave, check this out.
###117 And he had learned an entire Slayer song from start to
###120 finish in one day.
###122 Ethan's got just this really weird talent.
###127 When he applies himself to something, he's
###129 like the best at it.
###131 And he's completely natural, kind of like how he skates.
###132 
###140 ETHAN FOWLER: I was hanging out with Chris a lot.
###141 And we were getting way into this home brew
###144 recorded music and shit.
###147 The whole Guided By Voices and Sebadoh deal.
###151 CHRIS PASTRAS: Totally.
###152 I didn't even mention that.
###153 Yeah, we were making music primarily at the time.
###157 And so that was a huge inspiration for us.
###159 Like we were just like, fuck it.
###161 Let's Bucket Brothers it.
###162 Like that was our little joke band.
###166 We were pressured to make a video.
###167 And it was like the winter time.
###169 It was like February.
###170 And there was all this pressure to follow up "A
###172 Visual Sound." And Jason had like just recently left, or
###176 told us he was leaving.
###178 And there was like a lot of pressure there for people and
###180 he didn't really want to film a video part.
###182 And instead of like combusting, me and Ethan kind
###186 of looked at each other and were like, let's just have fun
###189 and go skating.
###190 And put it out in a month.
###191 And just, like, make the soundtrack.
###193 And drink beer.
###195 And bomb some hills.
###197 So, but I think people were expecting another "Visual
###201 Sound," and that really bummed them out-- some people.
###204 But I think like 5, 10 years later, we all watch the video
###207 and my friends will be like, dude, "Tincan
###209 Folklore" is rad.
###211 I used to say "Tincan Folklore" was taped together
###214 with masking tape.
###216 Like, that's how we wanted it to feel though.
###218 It's like so sketchy.
###220 We did the music ourselves and filmed it in like a month.
###224 And it was just so budget.
###226 "A Visual Sound," we had a goal and a vision.
###229 And we had something really big to say.
###235 And with "Tincan Folklore," we had something to say.
###238 It was just was not as big.
###240 It was more just like, hey, this is fun.
###242 This is skateboarding.
###243 Here's us putting out a video.
###244 It was more messy.
###247 ETHAN FOWLER: And so that was kind of a whole basis of that,
###250 like a four track skate video as represented in my part.
###258 Which is me, and Carnie, and Sean Young just drunk off our
###262 asses at 3:00 in the afternoon, playing the "Wizard
###264 of Oz" theme.
###265 
###283 CHRIS PASTRAS: To me, the things that got me stoked on
###285 skateboarding are things that make me want to ride my
###287 skateboard.
###288 And I always kind of felt like, to me it's more of the
###292 character behind it and the personalities, and their
###294 style, and the way they carry themselves on a board.
###297 Gets me way more stoked than technical videos that are
###300 competitive.
###301 
###307 It's interesting, though.
###308 The thing I always liked about Anti Hero and Stereo was that
###313 very thing.
###313 That people would come up to me in bars and be like, dude,
###317 Stereo videos, or the Deluxe videos, or Anti Hero videos.
###321 They were so stoked because it made them want to skate.
###323 And it made them--
###324 I think Eastern Exposure videos and some of those
###327 videos did the same thing.
###328 Like, anybody who's sitting on their couch can get up and be
###332 like, dude, Bobby Puleo found these amazing spots.
###335 Or man, Ethan Fowler's got such good style.
###338 And, like, go skate their town hand rail.
###340 
###343 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, it wasn't supposed to be perfect.
###345 I think it's interesting to watch.
###347 CHRIS PASTRAS: We felt it in the air when Stereo started
###350 and was going to be on fire.
###351 And you felt it in the air when its time
###353 was over with Deluxe.
###355 I was 19 when we started Stereo.
###357 So by the time we hit "Tincan Folklore," I thought I was
###360 over the hill.
###361 I was like 24.
###363 Everything has its time, man.
###365 I think it couldn't have kept going like it was.
###367 It's like too rad.
###368 Anything that hits that high of a point
###372 is bound to go down.
###373 And I don't really even remember.
###375 I'm trying to think.
###376 I think he left for Foundation.
###378 There was this whole thing with Mic-E punching Tod Swank
###382 at the ASR trade show.
###385 TOD SWANK: Mic-E Reyes was really bummed.
###386 The whole Deluxe guys were really bummed.
###389 They were telling everybody that we totally like stole him
###392 from those guys.
###394 At that trade show, hanging out with Mic-E Reyes, and
###396 Mic-E Reyes has got his arm around Josh being
###399 all like bros, fun.
###400 Hey, you know.
###401 Hey.
###401 And then he'd just be like, kick.
###403 Whatever.
###404 I was sitting there talking to somebody.
###405 And Moishe comes up.
###407 He's all, hey, Tod.
###408 How's it going?
###408 What's up and stuff?
###409 I'm all kind of flinchy because Mic-E's
###412 lurking around and stuff.
###415 And he's all, what, dude?
###416 Did you think I was going to punch you or something?
###418 And I'm all, no.
###419 And he was like, phew.
###421 Punched me in the stomach.
###423 Doubled over.
###424 Mic-E Reyes paid him $100 to come punch me in the stomach.
###427 And I was the guy that called those guys to forewarn them.
###430 And go, look, you guys need to take care of your business
###433 because your guy's not happy and stuff.
###435 And that's what we got.
###436 CHRIS PASTRAS: [INAUDIBLE], man.
###437 Fuck!
###439 Fuck, man!
###440 Fuck!
###441 ETHAN FOWLER: Let's put it this way.
###443 Getting on Stereo was like an extension of my skateboarding
###447 ethic to begin with.
###449 I never thought that, like, I need to go to this thing to do
###452 this specific thing because that's the thing to do--
###455 ever.
###455 And I still don't, and I never will.
###458 And being around people that do that kind of thing, if I'm
###462 interested in it, I'll do it.
###464 If I'm not, I won't.
###465 The Foundation dudes offered up.
###468 Well, those are guys that are actually out there skating,
###472 doing their thing.
###473 I get along with them.
###474 So, all right, I'll do that.
###476 TOD SWANK: I think he was our longest ever team rider on
###479 Foundation.
###480 I think 10 years he rode for us straight through.
###483 And super solid and obviously an amazing skateboarder with a
###488 great style and super--
###490 people are just always hyped on him.
###492 And he was a powerful and smooth skateboarder for sure.
###498 ETHAN FOWLER: Foundation was the rail team.
###501 And so, it was get the dudes who bust the big rails.
###505 And they were amazing skaters, still are.
###509 And just like being around that was all cool looking.
###513 It got me excited.
###515 -Yeah.
###515 ETHAN FOWLER: Lack of motivation.
###516 -If you'd stayed on Stereo, it would have been like, whoop,
###517 retirement part.
###519 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, at 19, that's
###520 probably not a good idea.
###522 
###533 I mean, you've got to be around motivated people or be
###536 motivated just for a little while.
###538 
###542 TOD SWANK: He always had fun ideas and would come and work
###545 on crazy graphics that people would either love or hate.
###551 The sales people would hate them.
###553 I can't sell them, or something like that.
###554 Because it's just too crazy, or something.
###556 
###561 ETHAN FOWLER: Talk about stick.
###564 Ow!
###565 That was my body.
###567 DAVE CARNIE: It's always weird to me to see someone skating
###569 who's not dressed for skating.
###571 And Ethan definitely now--
###574 it looks like he should be picking up a guitar and not a
###577 skateboard.
###578 Just there's a weird kind of visual disconnect to me, but
###582 he's still that amazing skater that he always was.
###585 TOD SWANK: I think it was last part in the last
###588 video that we did.
###589 And there was a debate whether he should have last part or
###593 Corey should have last part.
###595 ETHAN FOWLER: Man, I tell you.
###595 These kids these days, they hated that.
###598 -Really?
###598 ETHAN FOWLER: Oh, yeah.
###599 It's great.
###600 I love it.
###601 -They were like, why doesn't Corey Duffel
###602 have the last part?
###603 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, exactly.
###606 I had brought it up as a joke, just to see what would happen,
###609 like the company response.
###612 Well, it's been a while I've been on this team.
###617 What say you just chuck it at the end there?
###620 And then it caused this like, oh, jeez.
###622 I don't know.
###623 You know, big interoffice memos and call the skaters.
###625 Hey, is that all right if Grandpa Ethan
###628 gets the last part?
###630 And so it was just kind of funny to even have that.
###635 I mean, it wasn't an ego trip.
###638 It was the opposite.
###639 It was like, dude, let's see what happens.
###642 I want to see what happens if this even happens.
###644 And it's great because there was so much shit talking.
###648 Oh, that part sucked.
###650 That dude sucks.
###651 It's probably his retirement part.
###653 
###656 I love hearing shit like that.
###657 
###661 -Do you have any stuff we can look at?
###665 ETHAN FOWLER: I have lots of stuff.
###668 There's the studio.
###669 
###673 That's the guitar.
###675 -Damn, that's a big stack.
###677 ETHAN FOWLER: It's a stack.
###679 It's bigger now.
###681 There's me in my Bill Murray whiskey advertisement pose.
###685 -You have any skate related stuff, like
###687 say a stereo board?
###689 ETHAN FOWLER: Uh-uh.
###691 I got nothing like that.
###692 I have the new ones.
###694 I got trippy keyboard and some ancient amplifiers.
###698 -Do you have a Bummer High board?
###699 ETHAN FOWLER: I have that.
###701 And that's the bus.
###702 
###705 So there's that one and this one's got a dragon on it.
###708 It's like a sweet warrior dude down there.
###711 He's going to face the giant blue dragon.
###713 -So what's Bummer High?
###716 ETHAN FOWLER: I don't know.
###717 It's just an extension of my ethic.
###720 You ever just get really stoned, and you're having a
###722 great time, and someone comes up, and just
###725 completely blows it?
###726 
###729 This is dedicated to all those jerks.
###730 
###737 Bummer High is my love for evil music.
###740 It's about getting stomped on for just being the
###743 dude that you are.
###745 I want it to be how I see it.
###750 And that's not an egotistical thing.
###753 It's not driven by that.
###755 It's just I think it's a good way to go about things.
###759 It's a lot less stressful.
###762 You do what you want.
###763 You do it well.
###765 Or if you don't want to do it well, don't do it well.
###768 Just do it how you do it.
###770 And that shit shines through a thousand times brighter.
###775 
###789 DAVE CARNIE: Any kid who gets into skating and wants to be
###791 pro or sponsored to be in the industry doesn't realize how
###796 you're completely fucking up what you used to enjoy doing
###800 by yourself and with your friends.
###803 It happens to most skaters.
###804 I mean, there's a few.
###805 Like Ethan's one who didn't allow himself to get wrapped
###808 up in the, quote unquote, "industry." He
###811 just did what he wanted.
###813 And fortunately for him, what he does is so good that people
###817 can't help but have to pay attention to it.
###820 Yeah, he's always wanted to do Bummer High.
###824 He's been talking about that for years.
###826 Yeah, I don't think Ethan knows much about what's going
###830 on in skateboarding, which is kind of the
###833 beauty of it, I guess.
###835 ETHAN FOWLER: Nah.
###837 -Yeah, Spanky was telling me that you don't know who a lot
###840 of the skaters are.
###840 He's always like, yeah, Ethan doesn't know much about the--
###843 ETHAN FOWLER: Not really.
###845 I mean, just some dudes that peak my interest.
###850 -I heard something the other day, that Josh Harmony
###852 believes that Satan buried the dinosaur bones.
###856 ETHAN FOWLER: Oh, does he now?
###857 -Yeah.
###858 ETHAN FOWLER: Oof!
###859 -Then you know what?
###860 ETHAN FOWLER: That's interesting.
###861 -At first, I thought that was ridiculous.
###862 And then the more I think about it, I'm like, I want to
###865 start thinking that, too.
###866 ETHAN FOWLER: I'm mean, that would be cool because I'd like
###867 to see a physical incarnation of Satan.
###871 That would be pretty sweet.
###873 Because he's probably got a lot of shit to talk about,
###877 getting kicked out of heaven and all.
###879 I mean, it'd be pretty cool to hang out.
###883 -Watch Satan bury dinosaur bones?
###885 ETHAN FOWLER: We can bury something before
###887 the tape runs out.
###890 Maybe, like, in future times, people will think that God
###896 buried this.
###898 OK.
###899 
###901 It's time.
###902 
###906 And then, see, maybe they'll think Satan buried that and
###912 that there was no such thing as computers.
###914 
###925 Whatever.
###926 There it is.
###929 Rest well, sweet prince.
###932 Served well.
###935 There's your fucking "SLAP" forum right there.
###937 
###939 Finished.
###941 
###943 Oh, watch out.
###943 Shooting range.
###944 -Whoa.
###945 ETHAN FOWLER: You're going to trip over the invisible line.
###949 -What?
###949 You got guns?
###950 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, a little BB gun.
###953 Come out here and blast away at the cans.
###957 It's fun.
###958 -Damn.
###959 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah.
###959 -That's pretty cool.
###960
