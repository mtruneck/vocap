OBAMA UNVEILS THE MOST SWEEPING PROPOSALS
FOR CURBING GUN VIOLENCE IN TWO DECADES.


3
0:0:9,59 --> 0:0:12,74
SOUTH BAY POWER PLANT IN CHULA VISTA WILL
SOON BE A MEMORY.


4
0:0:12,74 --> 0:0:18,23
THE FIRST TURBINE WAS BUILT IN THE 1960S.
>> >>PEGGY: ALSO AHEAD, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE


5
0:0:18,23 --> 0:0:22,689
ARE SICK AND SIX PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN SAN DIEGO
FROM THE FLU THIS YEAR.


6
0:0:22,689 --> 0:0:26,949
HOW LONG OUR FLU SEASON WILL LAST AND SHOULD
YOU STILL GET VACCINATED.


7
0:0:26,949 --> 0:0:32,259
THEN IN THE FIRST STATE OF THE CITY ADDRESS,
MAYOR BOB FILNER COMPARES SAN DIEGO TO A SICK


8
0:0:32,259 --> 0:0:35,84
PATIENT.
>> >>: TONIGHT THE STATE OF OUR CITY CAN BE


9
0:0:35,84 --> 0:0:42,7
COMPARED I THINK TO A PATIENT WHO HAS FACED
A LIFE THREATENING DISEASE, WHO HAS SURVIVED


10
0:0:42,7 --> 0:0:46,999
PAINFUL TREATMENTS AND A LENGTHY RECOVERY.
>> >>PEGGY: I'LL TALK WITH MAYOR BOB FILNER


11
0:0:46,999 --> 0:1:2,499

HE PLANS TO SPEED UP ITS RECOVERY.


12
0:1:2,499 --> 0:1:27,329
CAPTIONS PROVIDED BY ECAPTIONS.
>> >>DWANE: GOOD EVENING THANKS FOR JOINING


13
0:1:27,329 --> 0:1:29,399
US.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS CALLING FOR A SERIES OF


14
0:1:29,399 --> 0:1:33,579
SWEEPING LAWS AND RESTRICTIONS TO OVERHAUL
THE NATION'S GUN LAWS.


15
0:1:33,579 --> 0:1:37,689
SOME OF THE STEPS COULD IMPACT WEAPONS TRAFFICKING
ACROSS THE BORDER INTO MEXICO.


16
0:1:37,689 --> 0:1:43,95
THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WILL ASK CONGRESS TO
CREATE A FEDERAL ARMS TRAFFICKING LAW, REINSTATE


17
0:1:43,95 --> 0:1:52,649
THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN, UNIVERSAL BACK GROUND
CHECKS AND LIMIT GUN MAGAZINES TO 10 ROUNDS.


18
0:1:52,649 --> 0:1:58,67
900 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE U.S. BECAUSE OF
GUN VIOLENCE SINCE THE SANDY HOOK MASSACRE


19
0:1:58,67 --> 0:2:2,789
IN DECEMBER.
>> >>: IF THERE'S EVEN ONE LIFE THAT CAN BE


20
0:2:2,789 --> 0:2:9,63
SAVED THEN WE'VE GOT AN OBLIGATION TO TRY.
I WILL SIGN A DIRECTIVE GIVING LAW ENFORCEMENT,


21
0:2:9,63 --> 0:2:14,66
SCHOOLS, MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND THE
PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY SOME OF THE TOOLS


22
0:2:14,66 --> 0:2:24,93
THEY NEED TO HELP REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE.
>> >>DWANE: THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION


23
0:2:24,93 --> 0:2:30,75
RELEASE AD STATEMENT FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT'S
ANNOUNCEMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE GUN CONTROL


24
0:2:30,75 --> 0:2:33,98
PROPOSALS.
IT SAYS IN PART ATTACKING FIRE ARMS AND IGNORING


25
0:2:33,98 --> 0:2:37,44
CHILDREN IS NOT A SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS WE
FACE AS A NATION.


26
0:2:37,44 --> 0:2:41,78
ONLY HONEST LAW ABIDING GUN OWNERS WILL BE
AFFECTED AND OUR CHILDREN REMAIN VULNERABLE


27
0:2:41,78 --> 0:2:48,45
TO THE INEVITABILITY OF TRAGEDY.
THE OPERATOR OF THE SAN ONOFRE NUCLEAR POWER


28
0:2:48,45 --> 0:2:56,22
PLANT WANTS MOST OF ITS TESTIMONY IN THE STATE
INVESTIGATION KEPT SECRET INTO WHAT WENT WRONG.


29
0:2:56,22 --> 0:2:59,4
KPBS REPORTER AMITA SHARMA HAS BEEN FOLLOWING
THE STORY.


30
0:2:59,4 --> 0:3:6,26
AMITA, SAN DIEGO GAS & ELECTRIC IS A MINORITY
OWNER.


31
0:3:6,26 --> 0:3:9,43
ON WHAT GROUNDS ARE THEY ASKING THIS INFORMATION
BE KEPT FROM THE PUBLIC?


32
0:3:9,43 --> 0:3:16,2
>> >>: THE PUC HAS STARTED AN INVESTIGATION
AS TO WHY THE GENERATOR MALFUNCTIONED.


33
0:3:16,2 --> 0:3:23,54
THAT INQUIRY IS LIKELY TO ASK FOR DATA AND
ANALYSIS THAT SDG&E AND EDISON RELIED TO ON


34
0:3:23,54 --> 0:3:30,14
TO PURCHASE THE GENERATORS.
THEY'RE SAYING SOME OF THAT INFORMATION THEY'RE


35
0:3:30,14 --> 0:3:37,17
GOING TO BE ASKING US TO TURN OVER MAY CONTAIN
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.


36
0:3:37,17 --> 0:3:41,39
FOR EXAMPLE, EDISON SAYS IF IT HAD TO MAKE
PUBLIC AN ANALYSIS OF THE STEAM GENERATOR


37
0:3:41,39 --> 0:3:47,16
DESIGN, THAT WOULD VIOLATE A CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT THE COMPANY HAS WITH MITSUBISHI


38
0:3:47,16 --> 0:3:51,32
WHICH MADE THE STEAM GENERATORS.
>> >>DWANE: WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH


39
0:3:51,32 --> 0:3:53,85
THE PUBLIC.
>> >>: IF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES


40
0:3:53,85 --> 0:3:59,6
COMMISSION DECIDES TO GRANT SDG&E AND EDISON
THE PROTECTIVE ORDER, ANYONE WHO HAS NOT SIGN


41
0:3:59,6 --> 0:4:9,21
AD NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO VIEW THE INFORMATION.


42
0:4:9,21 --> 0:4:14,12
ONE OF THE ALLIANCE FOR NUCLEAR RESPONSIBILITY
IS CHALLENGING THE LEGALITY OF KEEPING THE


43
0:4:14,12 --> 0:4:22,469
COMPANY'S TESTIMONY SECRET.
>> >>DWANE: THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION


44
0:4:22,469 --> 0:4:26,909
HEARD A PETITION FROM GROUPS WHO CLAIM SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA EDISON FAILED TO GET PROPER APPROVAL


45
0:4:26,909 --> 0:4:35,509
BEFORE REPLACING SAN ONOFRE'S STEAM GENERATORS.
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE NRC SKIRTED REGULATIONS


46
0:4:35,509 --> 0:4:40,99
WHEN IT REDESIGNED THE PLANT'S STEAM GENERATORS.
THE GROUP FRIENDS OF THE EARTH SAY A LOT OF


47
0:4:40,99 --> 0:4:45,2
EVIDENCE IS BEING WITHHELD.
THE NRC SAYS IT HAS NO AUTHORITY TO MAKE THE


48
0:4:45,2 --> 0:4:53,27
DOCUMENTS PUBLIC BUT WILL CONSIDER THE PETITION.
SIX WEEKS INTO HIS TERM AS SAN DIEGO MAYOR,


49
0:4:53,27 --> 0:4:57,39
BOB FILNER DELIVERED HIS FIRST STATE OF THE
CITY ADDRESS LAST NIGHT.


50
0:4:57,39 --> 0:5:0,77
PEGGY PICO TALKS WITH THE MAYOR ABOUT HIS
PLANS FOR SAN DIEGO.


51
0:5:0,77 --> 0:5:4,889
>> >>PEGGY: SAN DIEGO MAYOR BOB FILNER WELCOME
BACK TO EVENING EDITION.


52
0:5:4,889 --> 0:5:7,949
GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.
LAST NIGHT YOU LAID OUT SOME VERY AMBITIOUS


53
0:5:7,949 --> 0:5:15,8
PLANS WHICH INCLUDED ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY
FORESTRIES, SOLAR FOR GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS


54
0:5:15,8 --> 0:5:21,849
DOWNTOWN, I THINK A LIGHT RAIL TO THE AIRPORT.
JUST A MYRIAD OF THINGS.


55
0:5:21,849 --> 0:5:27,349
ONE IN PARTICULAR, THE NEW DEPARTMENT FOR
NEIGHBORHOODS FOR IMPROVING NEIGHBORHOODS.


56
0:5:27,349 --> 0:5:32,71
FIRST OF ALL, A LOT OF PLANS.
HOW DO YOU PLAN TO PAY FOR THOSE PLANS?


57
0:5:32,71 --> 0:5:36,729
>> >>: IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LEADER
O THE CITY AND MAYOR TO LAYOUT A VISION.


58
0:5:36,729 --> 0:5:43,169
WHEN PEOPLE KNOW WHERE WE WANT TO GO, THERE'S
EXCITEMENT ABOUT IT, A SENSE OF PROGRESS.


59
0:5:43,169 --> 0:5:47,58
I THINK THAT'S THE HARDEST POINT THAT PEOPLE
FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING.


60
0:5:47,58 --> 0:5:52,479
AND THEN HOW WE DO IT BECOMES NOT TRIVIAL,
BUT COMPARED TO LAYING OUT THE VISION.


61
0:5:52,479 --> 0:5:57,139
>> >>PEGGY: ARE TAXES INVOLVED IN THAT?
>> >>: I HAVE NO PLANS TO ASK FOR ANY TAXES.


62
0:5:57,139 --> 0:6:2,319
WE'RE A THREE BILLION DOLLAR OPERATION.
IT'S A QUESTION OF ONE CHANGING PRIORITIES.


63
0:6:2,319 --> 0:6:7,74
I WANT TO MOVE MONEY, FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE 200ﾊMILLION
DOLLARS HAS GONE DOWNTOWN, I WANT TO MOVE


64
0:6:7,74 --> 0:6:12,21
THAT INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD INFRASTRUCTURE.
WE CAN DO THAT.


65
0:6:12,21 --> 0:6:16,889
A LOT OF MONEY GOES FOR ADVERTISING OF P PRIVATE
HOTELS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.


66
0:6:16,889 --> 0:6:22,68
LET'S MOVE THAT INTO PUBLIC SAFETY, FOR EXAMPLE.
>> >>PEGGY: BUT JUST I WANT TO TOUCH A LITTLE


67
0:6:22,68 --> 0:6:24,9
MORE ON THAT.
REDEVELOPMENT MONEY IS GONE.


68
0:6:24,9 --> 0:6:29,349
SO WHERE WOULD THAT YOU HAVE PLANS OF WHERE
THAT MONEY COULD COME FROM.


69
0:6:29,349 --> 0:6:33,789
>> >>: THAT REDEVELOPMENT MONEY WAS BASED
ON THE FACT THAT PROPERTY TAXES WENT UP DOWNTOWN


70
0:6:33,789 --> 0:6:38,259
AND THAT MONEY STAYED DOWNTOWN.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK A LOT OF THAT


71
0:6:38,259 --> 0:6:43,29
TAX MONEY INTO THE GENERAL FUND.
WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT IT FROM WHERE IT WAS


72
0:6:43,29 --> 0:6:48,729
TO THE WHOLE CITY.
WHEN I TALK ABOUT SORT OF GRANDE OAS THINGS


73
0:6:48,729 --> 0:6:54,879
WE'RE GOING TO SOLAR POWER ALL OUR PUBLIC
BUILDINGS WITHIN FIVE YEARS, I HAVE TALKED


74
0:6:54,879 --> 0:7:1,29
WITH MANY SOLAR COMPANIES WHO WILL UP FRONT
THE CAPITAL COST FOR SUCH A PROGRAM AND THEY


75
0:7:1,29 --> 0:7:6,779
GET PAID OFF THE SAVINGS OF OUR ENERGY BILL.
SO IT'S NOT GOING TO COST US ANY MONEY TO


76
0:7:6,779 --> 0:7:11,499
PUT IT IN. WE PAY FOR IT FROM THE SAVINGS.
WE CAN DO THIS.


77
0:7:11,499 --> 0:7:14,34
IT DOESN'Tﾊ AND THERE'S GOING TO BE PUBLIC
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS.


78
0:7:14,34 --> 0:7:18,62
THERE'S WAYS TO DEAL WITH THIS.
THE MONEY IS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT, BUT NOT


79
0:7:18,62 --> 0:7:23,729
AS IMPORTANT OF THE VISION.
>> >>PEGGY: AND MOVING FORWARD WITH CONCEPTUAL


80
0:7:23,729 --> 0:7:29,159
VISION, YOU WILL OPEN I THINK IN JUST A FEW
WEEKS AN OFFICE IN TIJUANA.


81
0:7:29,159 --> 0:7:31,99
FIRST TIME.
WHAT IS YOUR FOCUS THERE, WHY DO YOU WANT


82
0:7:31,99 --> 0:7:36,29
TO DO THAT?
>> >>: THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON FEBRUARYﾊ1.


83
0:7:36,29 --> 0:7:40,84
THE CITY OF TIJUANA HAS A MUNICIPAL OFFICE
IN SAN DIEGO, BUT WE'VE NEVER HAD AN OFFICE


84
0:7:40,84 --> 0:7:44,29
IN TIJUANA. I JUST THINK MUTUAL RESPECT AND
MUTUAL INTEREST.


85
0:7:44,29 --> 0:7:51,819
WE'RE THE BIGGEST METROPOLITAN AREA BINATIONAL
METROPOLITAN AREA IN THE WORLD.


86
0:7:51,819 --> 0:7:57,439
WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT EVERY DAY, WHETHER
IT'S TRADE, RELATIONSHIPS, WHAT HAPPENS AT


87
0:7:57,439 --> 0:8:2,309
THE BORDER.
I WANT TO HAVE A VERYﾊ STAFF, PEOPLE THERE


88
0:8:2,309 --> 0:8:6,29
WHO CAN DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES AS THEY COME
UP.


89
0:8:6,29 --> 0:8:10,65
BY THE WAY, WE HAVE, YOU SAID HOW MUCH IS
THIS GOING TO COST, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TO


90
0:8:10,65 --> 0:8:14,36
SAY.
THE CITY OF TIJUANA IS GIVING US A SPACEﾊ


91
0:8:14,36 --> 0:8:20,18
THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AS IT
WERE OF TIJUANA IS GIVING US SPACE IN THEIR


92
0:8:20,18 --> 0:8:24,4
BUILDING, RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF TIJUANA,
VERY ACCESSIBLE, AND FREE.


93
0:8:24,4 --> 0:8:30,3
SO WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH TIJUANA
IN A MUCH MORE RAPID WAY, IN A MUCH MORE WIDE


94
0:8:30,3 --> 0:8:36,52
SPREAD WAY, AND BUILD UP NOT ONLY OUR BUSINESS,
BUT OUR EXCHANGES OF STUDENTS, AND ART, AND


95
0:8:36,52 --> 0:8:39,12
COMMERCE.
>> >>PEGGY: LET ME TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE COMPARISON


96
0:8:39,12 --> 0:8:43,1
O THE CITY'S FINANCIAL HEALTH TO A VERY ILL
PATIENT THAT'S RECOVERING.


97
0:8:43,1 --> 0:8:46,48
YOU PROJECTED UP TO A 40ﾊMILLION DOLLAR
DEFICIT.


98
0:8:46,48 --> 0:8:51,72
WHAT IS THAT DEFICIT BASED ON?
>> >>: WHEN THE MAYOR PREVIOUS MAYOR WHO DID


99
0:8:51,72 --> 0:8:57,19
AN INCREDIBLE JOB PUTTING US ON A SOUND FINANCIAL
FOOTING, HE LEFT THINKING THERE WAS GOING


100
0:8:57,19 --> 0:9:2,28
TO BE A SURPLUS, BUT THERE ARE LAND MINES,
I CALL THEM DOWN THE WAY THAT MIGHT EXPLODE


101
0:9:2,28 --> 0:9:7,9
ANY MIN MINUTE AND CAN PROJECT US INTO A 40ﾊMILLION
DOLLAR MORE DEFICIT.


102
0:9:7,9 --> 0:9:16,39
FOR EXAMPLE, PROP B WHICH IS THE NEW PENSION
SYSTEM IS GOING TO COST US JUST 37ﾊMILLION


103
0:9:16,39 --> 0:9:21,7
DOLLARS TO SET UP A NEW SYSTEM.
THAT WAS NOT FULLY PUT INTO THE BUDGET.


104
0:9:21,7 --> 0:9:26,54
THIS REDEVELOPMENT THAT YOU MENTIONEDﾊ THE
STATE IS RULING THAT CERTAIN FUNDS WE'RE GOING


105
0:9:26,54 --> 0:9:35,22
TO HAVE TO PAY THAT WERE PAID OUT OF THE REDEVELOPMENT.
WE PAY $15ﾊMILLION OR SO FOR PETCO, STADIUM.


106
0:9:35,22 --> 0:9:37,45
THAT'S GOING TO BECOME NOW PART OF THE CITY
BUDGET.


107
0:9:37,45 --> 0:9:42,48
>> >>PEGGY: THAT WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR.
WE HAVE ABOUT 30 SECONDS LEFT.


108
0:9:42,48 --> 0:9:47,38
YOU HAVE A PLAN TO WORK WITH THE UNION AND
CITY WORKERS OVER FIVE YEARS TO HELP SORT


109
0:9:47,38 --> 0:9:50,6
OF OFF SET THIS DEFICIT.
CAN YOU BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS?


110
0:9:50,6 --> 0:9:54,99
>> >>: I WANT TO HAVE A FIVE YEAR CONTRACT
THAT WOULD SAVE A LOT OF MONEY, YOU DON'T


111
0:9:54,99 --> 0:9:58,64
NEGOTIATE EVERY YEAR.
IT GIVES US A CHANCE TO REWARD EMPLOYEES THAT


112
0:9:58,64 --> 0:10:3,94
HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAY RAISE IN THE PAST FIVE
OR SIX, SEVEN YEARS.


113
0:10:3,94 --> 0:10:9,83
IT SAVES MONEY OFF OUR PENSION DEBT JUST BECAUSE
YOU HAVE THE CERTAINTY OF A CONTRACT NOT JUST


114
0:10:9,83 --> 0:10:14,59
A PROJECTION.
I WANT TO FOLLOW ON MY PROPOSITION B AND MY


115
0:10:14,59 --> 0:10:18,11
PROMISE NOT TO RAISE PENSIONABLE PAY OVER
THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS.


116
0:10:18,11 --> 0:10:24,65
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN HELP EMPLOYEES IN HEALTH
CARE COSTS, AND SHOW WE RESPECT OUR PUBLIC


117
0:10:24,65 --> 0:10:33,76
EMPLOYEES BUT WE HAVE TO RESPECT OUR TAX PAYERS
SENSE OF WHAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR WHAT TO ACHIEVE.


118
0:10:33,76 --> 0:10:38,22
>> >>PEGGY: SAN DIEGO MAYOR BILL YR, NR BOB
FILNER, THANKS FOR JOINING US.


119
0:10:38,22 --> 0:10:44,91

MOTOR VEHICLES FIND SAID UNLICENSED DRIVERS
ARE NEARLY THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO CAUSE


124
0:11:13,73 --> 0:11:19,33
A FATAL CRASH THAN DRIVERS WITH VALID LICENSES.
IT LOOKED AT FATAL CRASHES IN CALIFORNIA OVER


125
0:11:19,33 --> 0:11:25,22
23 YEAR PERIOD AND FOUND UNLICENSED DRIVERS
MORE LIKELY TO BE AT FAULT IN FATAL CRASHES.


126
0:11:25,22 --> 0:11:35,5
A CALIFORNIA LAW NOW NOW ALLOWS LICENSES FOR
UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH AS PART OF A FEDERAL DEPORTATION


127
0:11:35,5 --> 0:11:39,8
POLICY.
SAN DIEGO ATTORNEYS HAVE FILE AD CIVIL LAWSUIT

134
0:12:12,82 --> 0:12:18,79
ACT, IT'S EMOTIONAL MURDER.
SO IN OUR COUNTRY, WE NOW KNOW THAT THERE


135
0:12:18,79 --> 0:12:26,16
WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF BOY SCOUT LEADERS
FROM 1965 TO 1991 THAT DID THIS, IF NOT THOUSANDS.


136
0:12:26,16 --> 0:12:29,26
BUT THEY HAVEN'T RELEASED THE DOCUMENTS AFTER

143
0:12:55,84 --> 0:12:59,25
THE PLAN COMES FROM A REPORT THE CITY COMMISSIONED

SULLIVAN SAYS THE STRUCTURE HAS BEEN GRADUALLY
GUTTED.


159
0:14:38,45 --> 0:14:45,49
CONCRETE AND METAL PILES ARE SIFTED, AND SEPARATED.

WE'VE REMOVED 7,000 TONS OF STEAL SO FAR FROM

0:14:50,64 --> 0:14:55,39
THE SITE.
WE COULD HAVE UPWARDS OF 24,000 TONS OF STEAL


162
0:14:55,39 --> 0:15:4,93
THAT ARE RECYCLED AND SALVAGED.
VERY LITTLE WASTE ACTUALLY FROM A DEMOLITION


163
0:15:4,93 --> 0:15:8,84
OF THIS SIZE.
>> >>: WORKERS ON THE GROUND AND IN EXCAVATING


164
0:15:8,84 --> 0:15:13,58
AND SKIV GEARS DO THE HEAVY LIFTING.
MAJOR SUPPORT BEAMS ARE BEING READIED FOR

A EXPLOSIVE CHARGES THAT COULD GO ON FOR UP
TO TWO MINUTES.


166
0:15:19,779 --> 0:15:24,51

THUNDER AND THESE FIRST THREE FACILITIES WILL


167
0:15:24,51 --> 0:15:29,38
FALL TO THE NORTH.
THIS LAST WILL FALL TO THE EAST, ALL OF THEM


168
0:15:29,38 --> 0:15:34,63
FALLING AWAY FROM THE WATER.

COALITION ACTIVIST STRUGGLED FOR YEARS TO
SHUT DOWN WHAT SHE CONSIDERS AN ECOLOGICAL


171
0:15:44,47 --> 0:15:46,85
DISASTER.
>> >>: IT COMES FROM A DAY WHEN WE DIDN'T


172
0:15:46,85 --> 0:15:52,47
KNOW ANY BETTER AND WE THOUGHT WE HAD TO PUT
POWER PLANTS ON THE COAST USING THE OCEAN


173
0:15:52,47 --> 0:15:55,91
TO COOL THEM.
WE'RE NOT AT THAT DAY ANYMORE.


174
0:15:55,91 --> 0:15:59,74
REALLY IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME.
>> >>: THE FACILITY SPEWED AIR POLLUTION INTO


175
0:15:59,74 --> 0:16:5,34
NEARBY NEIGHBORHOODS AND CREATED ECOLOGICAL
HAVOC BY USING THE SHALLOW BAY WATER TO COOL


176
0:16:5,34 --> 0:16:13,17
THE GIANT TURBINES.
THE WATER WAS PUMPED BACK INTO THE BAY.

FISH NURSERY, SO JUVENILE FISH F WE WANT TO

0:16:18,21 --> 0:16:21,2
HAVE BIG FISH, WE HAVE TO HAVE BABY FISH,
THEY GROW UP HERE.


179
0:16:21,2 --> 0:16:28,91
THE SHALLOW WATERS ARE REALLY VERY IMPORTANT.
THAT'S WHY THIS PLANT WAS LOCATED IN THE MOST


180
0:16:28,91 --> 0:16:34,37
DAMAGING LOCATION IT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN,
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A FISH NURSERY AREA,

LOOK AROUND, SEE THE BIRDS USING IT, AND WE


184
0:16:52,9 --> 0:16:57,89
HAVEN'T DONE A VERY GOOD JOB FEATURING AREAS
LIKE THIS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK HERE YOU DON'T

EYE SORE.

OF THE POWER PLANT.

0:17:15,309 --> 0:17:19,659
IT'S PART OF THIS GRAND VISION FOR THE 500

MAKE IT A MORE WELCOMING ACCESSIBLE PLACE.

THE REVENUE THAT THE PORT EARNED FROM THE
SOUTH BAY POWER PLANT WHEN IT WAS CHURNING

OUT ELECTRICITY.
SHE SAYS BAY FRONT DEVELOPMENT HERE HAS BEEN


196
0:17:55,86 --> 0:18:1,179
HELD BACK BECAUSE NOT MANY DEVELOPERS WANT
TO BUILD A WORLD CLASS HOTEL WITH A VIEW OF

SAN DIEGO HAS WHAT IS CONSIDERED A LATE FLU


211
0:19:28,669 --> 0:19:31,399
SEASON.
WHEN IS OUR FLU SEASON TYPICALLY AND HAS IT


212
0:19:31,399 --> 0:19:36,789
PEEKED YET?
>> >>: USUALLY THE PEEK IS IN FEBRUARY, BUT


213
0:19:36,789 --> 0:19:39,11
IT MAY COME IN JANUARY THIS YEAR, A LITTLE
EARLIER.


214
0:19:39,11 --> 0:19:42,12
THE THING THAT HELPED IT IS THE COLD, DRY
WEATHER.


215
0:19:42,12 --> 0:19:45,74
THAT'S WHAT THE FLU NEEDS TO SPREAD.
>> >>PEGGY: HOW DOES IT SPREAD THAT WAY? I


216
0:19:45,74 --> 0:19:49,3
THINK THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION THAT COLD WEATHER
CAUSES THE FLU.


217
0:19:49,3 --> 0:19:55,759
>> >>: NO, DRAFTS DON'T DO IT.
IT'S IT COLD DRY AIR ALLOWS IT TO GET AIR


218
0:19:55,759 --> 0:20:0,12
LIFE AND SURVIVE LONGER.

WANT TO SPREAD.

221
0:20:8,409 --> 0:20:12,509
THERE'S BEEN MANY DEATHS.
THIS SEEMS TO BE A PARTICULARLY BAD FLU SEASON


222
0:20:12,509 --> 0:20:16,97
BACK EAST.
IS THE FLU STRAIN THIS YEAR PARTICULARLY WORSE


223
0:20:16,97 --> 0:20:20,759
THAN OTHER YEARS?

FACTORS TO GET COMPLICATIONS FROM THE FLU.

RISK?

AND PREGNANT WOMEN, AND ANYONE WITH A COEXISTING

ILLNESS, LUNG DISEASE, HEART DISEASE, KIDNEY
DISEASE, THAT KIND OF THING.

AND WHO SHOULD BE VACCINATED?


229
0:20:46,9 --> 0:20:51,399

I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD GET VACCINATED.


230
0:20:51,399 --> 0:20:54,749
NOT ONLY DO WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES
WE NEED TO KEEP THIS VIRUS FROM SPREADING.


231
0:20:54,749 --> 0:20:59,509
>> >>PEGGY: LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT SPREAD.
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT


232
0:20:59,509 --> 0:21:4,97
PROPER HAND WASHING, MAYBE STAYING HOME.
WHAT CAN YOU RECOMMEND IF YOU THINK YOU'RE


233
0:21:4,97 --> 0:21:10,669
COMING DOWN WITH THE FLU WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?
>> >>: STAY HOME, DO US A FAVOR, DON'T SPREAD


234
0:21:10,669 --> 0:21:15,919
IT, AND IF YOU NEED TO GO OUT OR SEE OTHER
PEOPLE, TRY TO KEEP YOUR COUGH TO YOURSELF,


235
0:21:15,919 --> 0:21:20,85
COUGH INTO YOUR ARM OR SLEEVE.
AND MAKE SURE YOU TRY NOT TO TOUCH YOUR FACE,


236
0:21:20,85 --> 0:21:24,769
AND GOOD HAND CLEANSING.
>> >>PEGGY: IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH HAND WASHING


237
0:21:24,769 --> 0:21:31,429
CAN STATISTICALLY IMPROVE THE LESSEN THE SPREAD
OF THE DISEASE.


238
0:21:31,429 --> 0:21:40,44
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DISPELL SOME MISCONCEPTIONS
ABOUT GETTING THE FLU SHOT.


239
0:21:40,44 --> 0:21:44,45
CAN YOU GET THE FLU FROM A FLU SHOT?
>> >>: IF YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE A HUNDRED MILLION


240
0:21:44,45 --> 0:21:48,48
FLU SHOTS LIKE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE
GOTTEN THE FLU SHOT, SOMEBODY IS GOING TO


241
0:21:48,48 --> 0:21:50,879
GET SICK AT THE SAME TIME THIGH GOT THE FLU
SHOT.


242
0:21:50,879 --> 0:21:56,559
AND BECAUSE OF THE MAGICAL THINKING THEY'RE
GOING TO THINK THE FLU SHOT CAUSED IT.


243
0:21:56,559 --> 0:22:4,22
THE YOU MIGHT HAVE A MILD ALLERGIC TYPE RESPONSE
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE FLU FROM THE


244
0:22:4,22 --> 0:22:6,899
FLU SHOT AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET SICK
FROM IT.


245
0:22:6,899 --> 0:22:10,44
>> >>PEGGY: THE REASON IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT
A LIVE VIRUS, CORRECT?


246
0:22:10,44 --> 0:22:12,82
>> >>: ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S BEEN KILLED.


247
0:22:12,82 --> 0:22:15,679
>> >>PEGGY: THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN GET IT
FROM THAT.


248
0:22:15,679 --> 0:22:20,259
IS IT TOO LATE FOR PEOPLE IN SAN DIEGO TO
GET VACCINATED, HAVE WE PASSED THE MARK WHERE


249
0:22:20,259 --> 0:22:23,61
IT WOULD DO US ANY GOOD?
>> >>: THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'RE JUST ON THE


250
0:22:23,61 --> 0:22:26,129
SHOULDER.
THE FUN IS ABOUT TO START IN TERMS OF THE


251
0:22:26,129 --> 0:22:29,58
FLU HAVING A PARTY HERE.
SO GET THE FLU SHOT.


252
0:22:29,58 --> 0:22:33,299
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.
>> >>PEGGY: OKAY, HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU


253
0:22:33,299 --> 0:22:38,87
SHOULD GO SEE YOUR DOCTOR, AND/OR DARE I SAY
GO TO THE ER WHEN YOU HAVE A FLU?

ATD HOME WITH FLU UDS AND MAYBE SOMETHING

0:22:49,749 --> 0:22:56,529
PREGNANT, YOU'RE OLDER, OR YOU HAVE ILLNESSES
OF THE HEART OR LUNGS, THEN YOU PROBABLY SHOULD

CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU THINK YOU'RE COMING
DOWN FOR THE FLU.

LOCAL CLINIC IF YOU CAN'T GET HOLD OF YOUR
DOCTOR.


260
0:23:5,429 --> 0:23:9,749
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY
ROOM UNLESS YOU'RE HAVING THE WARNING SIGNS
