###0 
###0 MALE SPEAKER: All right.
###1 I guess we'll get started.
###2 Yeah, very excited to be here.
###3 We have Jon Taffer here today who many of you know.
###7 Quick background on Jon.
###9 This is from his TV show.
###10 I love the opening.
###11 [ECHOES] Running a bar is not just a business.
###12 It's a science.
###14 And no one know more about science than Jon Taffer.
###16 Over the last 36 years, Jon has transformed
###19 hundreds of failing bars worldwide.
###21 Using his proven methods and no nonsense approach,
###23 Jon turns money pits into money makers.
###25 JON TAFFER: That's pretty good.
###27 MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.
###28 AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
###30 JON TAFFER: I'm not sure I can top that.
###32 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, your sound guy's awesome.
###35 All right.
###35 But anyway, so Jon is a very popular host
###38 of the TV show "Bar Rescue" on Spike TV.
###40 He travels around the country, finding failing bars
###43 and optimizing them.
###44 He's got a whole science and strategies and philosophy
###46 on how to optimize a bar.
###48 And at the end, you know, he leaves the bar
###49 in five days totally changed and generally successful.
###53 We'll talk about some of the ones that revert back.
###56 In 2010, he was appointed president
###58 of the Nightclub and Bar Media Group.
###60 And then he's recently served as chairman of Taffer Dynamics,
###63 where he acts as a consultant to restaurants, nightclubs,
###65 hotels, bars, everything.
###68 And then he just released his first book,
###70 which is why we're here.
###71 It's called "Raise the Bar.
###72 An Action-based Method for Maximum Customer Reactions."
###76 And it was published just a few months ago.
###78 And Jon, like I said, I'm a huge fan.
###80 So I'm very excited about this interview.
###81 And a round of applause.
###83 Thank you for being here.
###83 JON TAFFER: Thank you.
###84 Good to be here.
###85 AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
###88 MALE SPEAKER: All right.
###89 So before we jump into the book, let's first talk
###91 about kind of your journey.
###92 You started out working in the restaurant/bar industry.
###95 He even ran Barney's Beanery, which most people here
###98 know about.
###98 And then you went into the consulting business.
###101 Can you kind of talk about that transformation
###103 from working and owning bars to moving into being a consultant?
###106 JON TAFFER: Sure.
###107 I didn't learn this in college.
###108 I was a political science major.
###110 Very glad I didn't go into that business, by the way.
###112 But I started tending bar in college.
###114 And one thing led to another.
###116 And as Jon Lennon once said "life
###118 is what happens when you make other plans."
###120 And I wound up being in the bar business
###122 and started as a bartender.
###124 Became a head bartender, assistant manager,
###127 general manager.
###129 Moved into the hotel arena.
###130 Became a general manager of a large resort,
###133 and vice president of a hotel company.
###135 And in the mid-'80s, tax codes changed.
###139 And hotels couldn't write off the deductions
###142 that they used to.
###143 So suddenly, restaurants and hotels had to make money.
###147 They couldn't be write-offs anymore.
###149 And the hotel industry had operated
###150 what I call guest amenities, not businesses.
###154 So I came in.
###155 And I'm that guy who signed contracts
###157 with all the big hotel companies.
###158 I'm the guy who closed all the restaurants
###160 in the top of hotels all across the country.
###162 Shut them all down.
###163 I'm the first guy who ever put a leased restaurant in a Holiday
###166 Inn hotel, which was a very good idea for them,
###169 and really worked very deeply bringing brands into hotels
###173 and working in hotel food and beverage when I started.
###176 I wound up doing about 300 hotels all over the world.
###179 Properties like the Park Hyatt in Sydney, Grand Hyatt Tokyo,
###184 Taipei, Taiwan, Jerusalem, London,
###187 and started working all over the world for the hotel industry.
###190 And my whole purpose was to teach hoteliers
###194 how to do restaurants and bars that
###195 could compete against free standing.
###197 Because in those days, hotels had no credibility
###199 in that arena.
###201 And that's how I started.
###202 And I started my consulting company in 1986.
###206 And my first client was the company that I worked for.
###209 So I left, brought them in.
###211 And then my life changed when Sheraton came up to me
###215 and offered me a major contract.
###217 And I did 40 Sheraton hotels.
###220 And out of the 40 that I did, if I remember correctly,
###223 18 of them had the highest sales per foot in food and beverage
###226 in the entire hotel industry.
###229 And then it all took off for me.
###230 Then, my phone started ringing off the hook.
###232 In 1991, I opened my first-- actually, that's not correct.
###235 In 1989, I opened the first operation that I ever owned.
###239 Any Green Bay fans here?
###241 Green Bay Packer fans?
###242 First bar I ever owned was called Lynn Dickey's Sports
###245 Cafe, who was a quarterback for Green Bay back then.
###248 And I wound up having three of those.
###251 And what really changed my life was
###252 Mall of America in Minneapolis, which
###255 has more visitations than the city of Las Vegas.
###257 I opened three restaurants in Mall of America.
###259 The landlord gave me all the money-- I opened them for free
###264 and two years later, was a multimillionaire.
###266 And that really changed my life.
###268 And I'm inspired not by the bricks and mortar.
###273 I'm not inspired by the food, even
###275 though it's very important.
###277 I'm inspired by the look on your face.
###279 That's always been my inspiration.
###282 I don't believe that we serve food.
###284 I believe we serve reactions.
###286 We achieve it through food.
###288 I don't believe we play music.
###289 We play reactions.
###290 We achieve it through food.
###291 And I don't believe you guys sell ads.
###294 The fact of the matter is if the viewer doesn't react to the ad,
###298 the ad is meaningless.
###299 We don't sell ads.
###300 We sell reactions.
###301 We achieve it through ads, whether they're
###303 client reactions, whether they're advertiser reactions
###306 or prospect reactions.
###308 And that's what I learned at a young age.
###310 And that philosophy changed my life.
###313 And by understanding the principle
###315 of reaction management-- I own that term.
###317 I actually own the term "reaction management"--
###320 everything changed for me.
###322 And suddenly I realized that wow,
###324 I can cause you to do things you wouldn't normally do.
###327 I can manipulate the hell out of you if I want to.
###329 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###330 JON TAFFER: Make you buy what I want
###332 you to, go where I want you to, sit where I want you to.
###335 So I became a nut case on human behavior.
###338 And things really puzzle me.
###340 For example, 70% of all people that walk into a mall
###344 make a right hand turn.
###345 Why?
###346 Why?
###347 That -- excuse me-- that shit haunts me.
###350 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###351 JON TAFFER: It does!
###352 And it makes me say, what can I do to make you make a left?
###356 And I will lay awake at night figuring out ways
###359 to make you make that left turn.
###360 And that's very rewarding to me when
###362 I can change human behavior.
###364 MALE SPEAKER: Do you think that's because 90% of people
###366 are right-handed?
###367 JON TAFFER: I'm not sure.
###368 I'm a lefty.
###369 So I couldn't relate to that.
###370 But no, I'm not sure that is.
###372 There's an inherent movement towards the right.
###375 Maybe it's because we bear right on roads.
###378 Maybe we even bear right when we walk through airports.
###380 So maybe that's the principle.
###381 But it's interesting, when you go to Asia,
###384 and they walk into a mall, they make a right hand turn too.
###388 So I'm not sure that argument holds water.
###390 But there are certain things about human behavior
###393 that are shocking to me.
###394 And there's gold, when you can change behavior.
###398 Walt Disney was the master of it.
###400 You go to Walt Disney World in Orlando.
###402 It's 120 degrees.
###403 You're sweating like crazy.
###404 You spent $90 to walk through the door.
###406 Within three minutes, you're standing
###408 on line for an hour and a half.
###409 Right?
###410 You get off the line, you go through an attraction
###412 for two minutes.
###412 You get on another line for an hour and a half.
###415 After three lines in five hours, you've done three things.
###418 Now you want a Coke.
###419 So you stand online for 45 minutes for that.
###421 Now you get a cup with Mickey Mouse on it.
###423 Now you got to carry this thing around with you all day long.
###426 $14.95.
###427 And you realize when you go home with the bags of stuff
###431 you'll never use, the T-shirt you'll never wear,
###434 you realize wow!
###435 I sweated, I stood in line, and I loved it.
###440 And there's a manipulative quality to business.
###443 And you're no different.
###444 When we cause people to act in ways
###448 that enhance our objectives, not theirs, we all make money.
###452 So the trick is how do I get you to do
###454 what isn't natural to you, but have you love me for it
###457 in the end?
###458 That's the trick.
###459 Because I want you to come back and do it again.
###461 Right?
###462 There's no such thing as single transactions in the world.
###465 Everything is multiple transactions.
###467 I'm all about getting to that next transaction.
###469 That's what's important to me.
###470 MALE SPEAKER: Great.
###471 So we heard a lot about your consulting.
###474 How did the TV show come about with Spike TV?
###477 Did you initiate it?
###478 Did they initiate it?
###479 JON TAFFER: I did.
###480 I'm very proud of this.
###481 I've been a public speaker in my industry for about 30 years.
###485 And I give keynote speeches.
###486 And I get a lot of money for speeches.
###487 I've spoken in about 30 countries around the world.
###490 And I'll speak in major industry conventions.
###492 I'm speaking at Friday's next week for their corporate event.
###496 And I was giving a speech in Las Vegas,
###499 and somebody came up to me and said, you should be on TV.
###502 And I thought about it.
###503 So I went home, and I wrote something up,
###505 which was originally called "On the Rocks."
###507 And I came out here and went to Hermosa Beach
###509 to a friend that owned a bar.
###511 I got a camera, a microphone, and I got his employees
###514 to work with me.
###515 And I did a three minutes sizzle reel.
###517 And really it was me just screaming at people.
###519 I just walked into his bar, screamed
###521 and yelled at the employees.
###523 "Not negotiable!
###524 You're fired!" and there's this whole thing.
###526 And I didn't know anybody in Hollywood.
###528 I was a bar guy.
###529 And so I had this three minutes sizzle reel.
###532 I sent it cold to five companies and got three offers--
###537 and it was unbelievable-- within a week.
###539 And I had offers from three different production companies.
###542 So I had a look at each company, do background checks,
###545 and the company I picked was the best one, but not
###547 necessarily the best financial deal.
###550 So I thought more long term than short term.
###552 I signed with 3 Ball Productions in Manhattan Beach, who
###555 also does "Biggest Loser" and one of the largest reality
###557 show producers.
###558 They picked me up, signed me to a contract,
###561 and Spike picked up the show four days later.
###565 So in the time I got the idea, to the premiere
###568 of the show on TV-- not the pilot,
###570 the first season-- was less than a year.
###573 And I'm told that's almost a record.
###575 And normally, it takes two to three years
###578 to get to that level.
###579 So I was blessed, I think.
###581 Some of that's timing.
###582 I get that I'm pretty good at what I do.
###583 But some of it is timing.
###584 I just happened to be in the right place at the right time,
###585 I think.
###586 So the show premiered almost three years ago.
###590 We just aired our 49th episode to the highest ratings
###593 in the history of the show.
###594 AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
###595 JON TAFFER: Thank you.
###596 
###600 Honestly, it's been an incredibly humbling experience
###603 for me.
###604 And I'm shocked when celebrities get these egos that suddenly
###608 you're unimportant to them.
###609 They're above you.
###610 It has made me appreciate humanity, the people around me
###615 that support me, believe in me.
###617 This has actually made me a better person.
###619 And I wouldn't have thought about it that way
###621 before the fact.
###622 But it has humbled me.
###625 I feel like I'm hugged by America every day.
###627 It's an incredible feeling.
###629 MALE SPEAKER: That's great.
###630 And so 49 episodes-- how do you decide which bars to rescue?
###633 I'm sure you've got a ton of requests
###635 from bars all over the country.
###636 And you've done all over the country.
###638 And some are really awful.
###639 And some are just horrific, like,
###641 how do you decide which to--
###642 JON TAFFER: That's my choice.
###643 Awful or horrific.
###645 It's pretty accurate too.
###646 Actually, when I did the show, my deal with the network
###649 was I wanted you to find me the worst in the world.
###652 I don't want this to be a cake walk.
###653 I want to fail.
###655 I want to fail.
###656 So now that we're known, about 1,000 bars
###661 submit applications a year for me
###663 to scream at them, which is amazing to me.
###666 And these are people that are in trouble.
###668 So we go through a screening process.
###669 First of all, we picked the cities that make sense to us.
###672 We like small towns, big towns, Midwest, East Coast.
###674 We like to move it around and mix it up,
###676 so we have the different subcultures
###678 of America, if you will, in a show.
###680 The next thing we do is we see if they're real.
###682 Are they hustling me for a remodel?
###683 Or are they really in debt?
###684 Are there really houses on the line?
###686 Is this a real story?
###687 So we verify those elements.
###689 We verify the debt, all that kind of stuff.
###691 Make sure that there are stakes, if you will.
###694 Then, once we've narrowed it down to about 40 or 50,
###698 then I'll send a producer to each
###700 of those locations with just a little camera.
###703 And they'll talk to each staff member for about 20 seconds.
###707 That's all.
###708 What's your name?
###708 What do you here?
###709 What do you think of this place?
###710 What's your name?
###710 What do you do?
###711 So we can see the behavior of the employees.
###715 And I'm looking for a compelling story,
###717 I want you rooting for the owner or hating the owner.
###720 But I want you connected to it.
###721 And the secret of "Bar Rescue" is finding those personalities
###726 that are exciting to be with.
###727 And if you think it's frustrating to watch,
###730 you should live it, Because it's quite an experience.
###733 Very
###733 MALE SPEAKER: Very cool.
###734 And what would you say is the number one
###735 reason most bars fail.
###738 JON TAFFER: Excuses.
###739 But that's the reason why all of you would fail too.
###741 And here it is.
###743 You wake up in the morning.
###744 You're failing.
###745 So you blame the President.
###747 You blame Congress.
###747 You blame Greece.
###749 Blame the Euro.
###750 I mean, construction industry-- it's the Mayor!
###753 Oh, it's the this.
###754 And you wake up in the morning, and you look in the mirror.
###756 And you're not failing, because it's the other guy's fault.
###759 Or it's the economy's fault.
###760 But if you looked in the mirror and said
###762 I'm failing because I'm me, you wouldn't like it.
###765 And you'd change that.
###767 And I believe the common denominator
###769 of failure in any business is excuses.
###772 As long as you wake up and blame poor sales
###775 on the economy or an environment, then
###777 you have no motivation to make it better,
###779 because it's not your fault.
###781 But in the worst economic environment,
###784 four, five years in this country, ago, in this country
###786 that we've seen, in our lifetimes,
###788 there were people making a lot of money, weren't there?
###790 In the height of that recession, there
###792 were people selling advertising, people opening restaurants,
###794 people building businesses.
###796 Somebody's making money.
###797 So the excuse is bull.
###799 It's bull.
###800 So wake up in the morning and own your failure.
###803 Look in the mirror and say I'm failing because of me!
###805 And you won't like it.
###807 And then you'll change it.
###808 But as long as you don't put it on you,
###810 you have no motivation to change it.
###813 So in short, if you own your failure,
###815 you'll own your success.
###817 If you don't own your failure, you'll never dig out.
###820 And I find that in any business.
###822 Always the common denominator of failure,
###824 personally, is excuses.
###826 You don't want to be a failure, do you?
###828 AUDIENCE: Not at all.
###829 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###829 JON TAFFER: You don't want to look in the mirror
###830 and experience that.
###832 If you can't blame anybody but yourself,
###834 you're going to change.
###835 You're going to fight it out.
###836 That's the deal.
###837 MALE SPEAKER: Great.
###838 So a lot of guys in this room want to open bars,
###841 like this one sitting up here in the front row.
###842 What do you say to these people that
###844 want to open their own bar one day.
###846 JON TAFFER: Well, first of all, know your reason.
###848 Anybody see the Murphy's episode of "Bar Rescue"?
###850 The two frat brothers opened a bar?
###852 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###852 JON TAFFER: The last thing you want to do
###853 is open a bar because you like to drink.
###855 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###856 JON TAFFER: That's like somebody into drugs
###858 who becomes a pharmacist.
###859 I mean that's just--
###860 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###861 JON TAFFER: It makes no sense at all.
###863 You got do it for the right reasons.
###864 You've got to do it because you love the business.
###867 If you love the social aspect of it,
###868 you'll never do your financials.
###870 You'll just hang with people all day long.
###872 If you love the drinking, that's even worse.
###874 You got to love the business.
###875 It's a tough business.
###877 And we were talking before we started, in the clothing store
###879 business, you buy shirts.
###880 You mark them up 60%, 70%.
###882 If you got 10 shirts on the shelf,
###884 you go home that night, you come back in the morning,
###886 you still got 10 shirts on a shelf.
###888 Not the bar business.
###888 Bar business, you've got to manage every minute.
###892 Product is exposed.
###893 Liabilities are exposed.
###894 It's a tough business.
###896 Honestly, if I had to do it over again,
###898 I'm not sure I would be in this business.
###900 To be honest with you, when I look at all the work
###902 that I did over the years, I could
###904 have applied those efforts to bigger things rather than
###908 smaller bars.
###909 And I was involved in Rainforest Cafe, for example.
###911 That went public, and it was big dollars.
###913 Don't get me wrong.
###914 I don't regret being in the bar business.
###916 But when I look at my life, all the nights that I worked,
###920 all those evenings, days, 20-hour days,
###922 I look back and say gee, wonder if I would have been a lawyer.
###925 Nah, maybe not a lawyer.
###926 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###927 AUDIENCE: No!
###928 JON TAFFER: There are lifestyles that are easier is my point.
###931 So you've got to love the business
###933 and be passionate about it to make it
###934 through those late nights and those mornings.
###936 MALE SPEAKER: Great.
###937 And what's been the hardest "Bar Rescue"
###939 you've ever done and why?
###940 
###943 JON TAFFER: I'm going to guess the hardest "Bar Rescue" I've
###945 ever done was the one that aired-- actually,
###949 the last one with the two twins, which
###952 aired just about three weeks ago,
###954 where I had a family-- I mean, these guys
###956 hadn't had Christmas dinner together in nine years.
###958 They lived across from each other, these twins,
###960 and they hated each other.
###961 And what I learned about "Bar Rescue"
###963 is it's so about the people.
###966 And at the end of the day, I got those twins together.
###968 It was a pretty intense episode.
###969 And I don't know if any of you saw
###971 that episode-- the son Tyler, the nephew,
###974 sent me a note that they had their best Christmas dinner
###977 in all these years for the family.
###980 So when you have personalities that don't work,
###983 that's the challenge.
###984 I can paint the bar.
###985 I know how to set it up.
###986 I know how to put the technology in it.
###987 I know how to decorate it.
###988 I know how to program.
###990 The people-- remember these people
###992 aren't failing because of their bars.
###994 They're failing because of them.
###996 And that's my challenge.
###997 And that was a particularly good one.
###999 And I'm going to answer the next question for you.
###1001 The best one we've ever done is probably
###1003 "Spirits on Bourbon," which was the first episode this season.
###1007 They're up $125,000 a month.
###1010 AUDIENCE: Holy shit!
###1011 JON TAFFER: The barber shop chair
###1012 is the most photographed attraction on Bourbon Street.
###1015 Last month, it did over $80,000-- just that chair.
###1020 And the guys, they sent me a note.
###1021 They've become good friends.
###1022 They just bought a warehouse, so they
###1025 can buy cups for their Resurrection cocktails, 20,000
###1028 at a time to keep their prices down.
###1031 And it's to me-- I'm not always right in life.
###1035 None of us are.
###1035 But I'm pretty close.
###1037 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###1038 JON TAFFER: When it comes to the bar business.
###1040 People, when they stay with the plan, tend to do really well.
###1043 "Moon Runners"--
###1044 MALE SPEAKER: Yup.
###1045 JON TAFFER: Which is from your neck of the wood.
###1047 I mean, their numbers are up 600%.
###1049 And there's an independent website-- forgive me,
###1052 I forget the name.
###1053 Bar Rescue something-- that somebody does,
###1055 and they track them all.
###1057 And I believe on their site-- and I haven't been there
###1060 in a few weeks-- on their site, we had aired 47 of 48.
###1064 They claim that seven closed.
###1066 And I don't count.
###1066 So I'm going to take them at face value.
###1068 But what they did is they did Before and After Yelp.
###1071 And then they tell you if it's opened and closed.
###1073 So 48 or 49 episodes are there.
###1075 If seven have closed, that puts us
###1078 in about an 80% track record.
###1079 And when you consider the depth of failure these people are in,
###1082 I'm pretty proud of that.
###1083 I'm not sure we could do much better, to tell you the truth.
###1086 But the pirates episode has to be mentioned.
###1088 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###1088 JON TAFFER: Only because it was the most bizarre experience
###1092 of my life.
###1093 These people were pirates.
###1095 They couldn't speak un-pirate.
###1098 They couldn't talk like we do.
###1100 They spoke like 1845 pirates.
###1103 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###1103 JON TAFFER: They didn't have regular clothes.
###1106 These people woke up every morning to be pirates.
###1110 And when I said to them how how do you make a living?
###1113 Oh, Renaissance Faire.
###1114 That's two weeks a year.
###1116 Oh, no, there's a big pirate community.
###1117 I go on Facebook.
###1118 200 people.
###1120 And these people wanted to be pirates.
###1122 And if you remember, when I put them in regular clothes,
###1124 they couldn't speak non-pirate.
###1127 So I guess let them play in their sandbox, so to speak.
###1131 But that was a very frustrating one for me,
###1134 because a Discovery TV was right next door.
###1137 There were huge office buildings in Silver Spring.
###1139 The concept that we created was for lunch and happy hour,
###1142 for them to close early, because at night,
###1145 that was a dangerous, not a very good area.
###1147 They never even opened for lunch.
###1149 They tore the sign down six hours after I left.
###1153 It's on YouTube.
###1154 A vigil around a fire, where they were chanting, of course,
###1157 pirate songs.
###1159 And it was one of the most bizarre experiences of my life.
###1163 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###1164 JON TAFFER: I will never forget it.
###1165 And they're still open, by the way,
###1167 which is unbelievable to me.
###1169 MALE SPEAKER: So you actually kind of just referenced this.
###1172 I know a couple people in the crowd
###1173 had asked me this ahead of time.
###1174 But a lot of people watch your show,
###1176 and then they get on Yelp immediately following,
###1178 and see whether it's been successful or not.
###1180 And several times, we've seen them change the name back.
###1183 They reverted back to their bad ways.
###1185 Other people have kept what you've
###1187 done or remained successful.
###1188 Can you kind of talk about why is it
###1190 that some have reverted and failed,
###1191 while others keep what you've given them, et cetera.
###1193 JON TAFFER: Yeah, good question.
###1195 These people make thousands of bad decisions
###1197 that got me there.
###1198 Right?
###1199 Think of all the choices that they
###1201 made from hiring to products to management
###1204 to cause them to be in the depth of failure
###1207 that they're in when I show up.
###1209 And my challenge is to reverse that level
###1214 of failure, that depth of failure.
###1216 I forgot your question.
###1217 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, it was just why
###1218 do some revert back to their old name and [INAUDIBLE].
###1220 JON TAFFER: So what happens is-- and I'll pick one.
###1222 The Brixton in Austin, Texas.
###1224 Remember that one?
###1225 With the cocky husband-- they changed the name back
###1228 a week later.
###1229 But they kept everything else.
###1230 They kept the infusion cocktails.
###1232 But they were hung up on The Brixton.
###1233 They're doing pretty well.
###1235 But guys, you know this.
###1237 If the Google name had a terrible association
###1240 with it and a reputation for not delivering
###1243 on the promises made, how much advertising would you sell?
###1246 So if I didn't change the company,
###1248 but put a new sign on the building,
###1250 at least I have a chance at a new future.
###1252 So, Swanky Bubbles-- remember that one?
###1257 Who puts Swanky Bubbles back on a building.
###1259 You think you would thank you for taking it down.
###1262 But they changed the name back the next day.
###1264 And his logic was it's confusing.
###1266 My old customers won't come to the new bar.
###1270 You were losing money with the old customers.
###1272 And here's what they don't understand.
###1274 When they changed the name back, they're
###1276 thinking of the customers they have.
###1278 I'm trying to get them to customers they don't have
###1282 and the thousands of people that they alienated and chased away.
###1285 So with a new brand comes a honeymoon.
###1288 With a new brand comes a whole new future.
###1291 I have probably kept as many brands as I've changed.
###1294 So I don't just go in there and change the brand.
###1296 We do a lot of market research.
###1298 I use Esri.
###1299 And I do all my online research.
###1301 By the way, "Bar Rescue" is absolutely in real time.
###1303 I should speak to this for a moment.
###1305 You know, the first day I show up at about 4:35
###1308 in the afternoon.
###1309 I go in and do my recon that night.
###1311 When I leave the bar that night, that day ends for me.
###1313 I go back to my hotel.
###1314 The next day is Day 2.
###1315 We train, we have stress test.
###1317 The next day is Day 3 training.
###1319 At the end of Day 3, at about 9 o'clock,
###1322 I get the staff out of there at night.
###1324 And then we go to work building the bar.
###1327 We do it for a true 36 hours.
###1329 So the evening of Day 3, the day of Day 4,
###1332 and the morning of Day 5, we remodel the bar.
###1335 And then I reveal it to them on Day 5.
###1338 It is absolutely in real time, and not one word of it
###1341 is scripted ever.
###1342 Candidly, if it was, I'd walk off.
###1344 And I just won't do that.
###1346 So it is incredibly real.
###1348 And that's why the casting, the selection
###1351 of the bars and the characters are so important,
###1354 because I'm not going to script it.
###1356 And in "Bar
###1356 Rescue," we use the phrase "we work with what we have.
###1360 We don't create what we don't have."
###1362 And it's working the moment.
###1364 And we've gotten pretty good at it, I think, after 59 of them
###1367 or so.
###1368 MALE SPEAKER: Man.
###1368 So why did you decide to write a book.
###1372 JON TAFFER: I've been a public speaker for 30 years.
###1374 I love helping people.
###1375 I can't tell you-- you know, I tell people this story often.
###1378 One of the greatest moments in my life was an operator.
###1381 When I opened Mall of America, it had a dishwasher.
###1383 His name was Theo.
###1385 And this guy was a dishwasher, almost
###1387 a gang banger kind of kid in Minneapolis.
###1390 And my prep cook quit, and I made him a prep cook.
###1393 I liked this kid for some reason.
###1395 Then I'm opening another restaurant six months later.
###1397 And I pick a training team from that restaurant
###1399 and I fly them to another city.
###1401 And I took Theo as my prep cook trainee.
###1404 And now we're in a hotel meeting room, sort of like this.
###1407 And all my training team goes up in front
###1409 of the staff to introduce themselves.
###1411 And Theo walks out there in a shark skin suit,
###1415 missing his teeth and gold in the front,
###1418 and says six months ago, I was a dishwasher.
###1420 And look at me today.
###1422 And I cried.
###1424 And I realized that was the most important thing to me
###1426 I could ever do.
###1428 And I've been fortunate in my life.
###1429 I've made money.
###1430 Now I want to make people.
###1432 And I'm really inspired by that.
###1434 And we talked about this earlier,
###1435 when people come up to me and say they've gotten promoted,
###1438 I've inspired them, they've raised the bar, whatever
###1441 it is it's an incredibly motivating thing to me.
###1443 So the book was an effort to do that,
###1445 to try to take what I do and share it with more people,
###1449 because I really believe in it.
###1450 MALE SPEAKER: Very cool.
###1451 And so your philosophy of reaction management
###1454 which you coined is kind of the main theme throughout the book.
###1457 Can you give everyone a quick summary of what that is?
###1459 JON TAFFER: Sure.
###1461 First, let me explain how it came about,
###1462 because I don't cover it very much in the book.
###1464 When I was young, my mother was incredibly difficult,
###1467 a little violent.
###1468 So when I was seven, eight, nine, ten years old,
###1470 I understood that if I couldn't control her mood,
###1474 I was going to get my ass kicked.
###1476 So at a very young age, I learned the sensitivity
###1480 to watch her face, read her moods.
###1483 And I developed this skill to sense and feel people.
###1489 Like your crossed arm, right?
###1492 I would stare at you and shake my head
###1493 until those arms uncrossed.
###1495 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###1497 JON TAFFER: Same with you.
###1498 I mean, I look at everybody's body language.
###1501 And I do it subliminally.
###1502 I don't think about it consciously.
###1504 Your eye contact, your body language, your energy level,
###1506 your posture.
###1507 And I read these things.
###1509 And I figured out how to manipulate you.
###1511 And here's a philosophy.
###1513 If you go into a restaurant and you sit down
###1515 and you order food.
###1516 And the food comes to the table, and it's put down on a table.
###1519 When the plate hits the table-- and this could be anything.
###1521 It could be a Google ad-- one of two things happens.
###1525 Either the guest sits up, reacts to it, or nothing happens.
###1530 If nothing happens, we're stuck in mediocrity the rest
###1533 of our lives.
###1534 Whether that's a Google Ad, whether it's a plate of food,
###1537 whether it's a song, whether it's the color of a wall,
###1540 nothing we do is anything other than creating human reactions.
###1546 When reactions go in the direction we want them to,
###1549 people write us checks, don't they?
###1552 They move to other sides of the country.
###1553 They take jobs.
###1555 Everything changes, when we can cause
###1557 people to react in the ways that we need to.
###1560 So at a young age, I developed this skill.
###1563 And that's why I think "Bar Rescue" works
###1565 for me because I'm only with these people five days.
###1567 I got to read them quick.
###1568 And we were talking earlier-- I mean, I'm people's faces,
###1570 for sure-- but there's a reason why.
###1573 This might surprise you.
###1574 I am never angry on "Bar Rescue."
###1576 It is completely calculated.
###1578 It is completely deliberate.
###1580 And we were talking, if I wanted to pick on him,
###1582 OK, this is a guy with some pride.
###1584 First, I'm going to try pride.
###1585 Do you want to be a success?
###1587 Do you want to be a failure?
###1587 What are your parents going to say when they see you faiiling?
###1590 I'll try, that didn't work.
###1591 Now, I'll try fear.
###1592 You're going to lose everything!
###1593 You're going to be out in the street.
###1595 What are you gon-- that didn't work.
###1597 Picture your kids.
###1598 Can you come true for your kids?
###1599 That didn't work.
###1600 Well, now I have only one option.
###1602 I'm going to rip you to shreds.
###1604 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###1605 JON TAFFER: Because I have no choice.
###1608 I have no choice.
###1609 And here is "Bar Rescue" in its most essence, if you will,
###1613 right at the core.
###1615 You're going to dig your heels in.
###1617 And you're not going to let me in.
###1619 You're going to get defensive.
###1621 So I'm going to be in your face.
###1622 I am going to be relentless, until I
###1626 can make you doubt yourself for one second.
###1629 And if I can make you doubt yourself
###1631 just a little for one second, your brain opens
###1633 and I walk right the hell in.
###1636 And that's the way it is.
###1637 I got to break you down and make you doubt yourself.
###1640 Because you're the one who's wrong.
###1642 You're the one losing money.
###1644 I've got the bank accounts to prove it.
###1645 So I stand there with this cocky, confidence.
###1648 And I will beat and beat and beat on you
###1651 until that crap comes open.
###1653 And then I walk in, and we were talking before I started,
###1656 the biggest fights I have are always
###1658 the biggest hugs at the end, aren't they?
###1661 So when you turn them, you really turn them.
###1663 It's an incredible thing to watch.
###1665 And they walk different four days later.
###1668 Once I crack through, their posture's different.
###1671 Their facial expression is different.
###1672 When you look in your eye, you can truly
###1674 see this human transformation.
###1676 It's remarkable.
###1678 And you see it on TV, but it's even more evident
###1680 when you're there.
###1681 MALE SPEAKER: Right.
###1682 Very cool.
###1683 So a lot of people in this room work in advertising.
###1685 You talk about advertising in the book.
###1687 Can you talk about what sort of advertising bars
###1689 can do from digital to-- you talk a lot about word of mouth
###1693 too, whether that can be something generated.
###1695 JON TAFFER: Sure.
###1696 Let me start by saying I come from an advertising background.
###1698 My grandfather invented Direct Mail.
###1701 And gets credit for inventing Direct Mail in Brooklyn, New
###1704 York.
###1704 When he was 16 years old, he bought a printing press,
###1707 and started putting fliers in newspaper
###1709 at the newspaper stand on the corner.
###1711 And then he walked down the street
###1713 and wrote down the names in the mailboxes
###1715 and started leaving flyers in the apartment
###1717 buildings in Brooklyn.
###1718 And then, he started getting and mailing them
###1721 from this little storefront that he had.
###1723 And one of the largest ad companies in the world
###1725 knew we were advertising, bought my grandfather's
###1727 little storefront operation, brought him in.
###1730 The term Direct Marketing was invented.
###1733 And my grandfather then created the entire direct
###1737 marketing/direct mail.
###1738 And my family has done the direct marketing
###1741 for Volvo, Mercedes Benz, and a bunch of companies
###1743 now for three generations.
###1745 So I come from a marketing background.
###1747 It's in my blood.
###1748 And to me, marketing is just human reactions.
###1752 Period.
###1753 End the discussion.
###1753 We don't do ads.
###1754 We do human reactions.
###1755 We achieve them through ads.
###1757 I don't even make phone calls.
###1758 I create human reactions.
###1759 I do it on the phone.
###1760 The fact of the matter is everything
###1762 I do-- no different than this moment
###1764 right now-- if I don't create reactions, I fail.
###1767 Period, and so do you.
###1769 So it's a way of life.
###1770 You study every facial expression, every inflection
###1773 in voices, everything to manipulate you
###1777 for me to get your check.
###1779 I have no guilt doing that, because I know when you give me
###1781 a check, I'm going to come through for you in the end.
###1783 That's the trick.
###1784 When you know you're doing right you can fight harder.
###1787 You got to know you're doing right.
###1788 You guys do right here.
###1790 You're a great company.
###1791 I advertise on Google myself.
###1793 But I've learned that if an ad doesn't create a reaction,
###1797 it's worthless.
###1798 And where we blow it, in that business,
###1800 is when we take advertising dollars from a client
###1804 and place an ad that we know is not going to get a reaction,
###1807 that we know is going to fail.
###1808 We don't serve them.
###1809 We don't get a renewal.
###1810 We don't serve our ourselves and our company.
###1813 So the end result is you guys have to create reactions
###1816 from the advertising that you do.
###1818 Or you're never going to grow that business.
###1821 So you're as much in the reaction business as I am.
###1824 MALE SPEAKER: Right.
###1825 Very cool.
###1826 And so a lot of us, we love the parts
###1829 of the show when you really dig deep into the science
###1831 behind the bar, the science of everything that you do.
###1833 And it's all to increase workplace efficiency
###1836 and whatnot.
###1837 Google prides itself on trying to do the same things.
###1839 So what are some of the sciences you
###1842 learned to optimize for workplace efficiency.
###1844 JON TAFFER: You know, there's a lot of things to it.
###1846 And I want to reiterate the question
###1847 that you asked me before.
###1848 You asked me about social marketing,
###1850 and I didn't mention it.
###1851 You know, social marketing is a big word today.
###1853 And everybody does it.
###1854 But who does it well?
###1856 Not too many.
###1857 It's a new science.
###1859 We're still figuring it out ourselves.
###1861 I mean, just because I have 100,000 Twitter followers,
###1864 how do I monetize that?
###1865 How do I motivate these people?
###1867 What is it?
###1868 Is it an event?
###1868 Is it a discount?
###1869 I mean, what is it that causes people
###1872 to-- and I'm going to use my word--
###1873 react to my social marketing?
###1876 No reaction, no dollars.
###1877 No reaction, no win.
###1878 So where people blow it is they go
###1881 through the mechanics of social marketing.
###1884 They go through the mechanics of advertising,
###1886 but they never really focus on "where are the reactions?"
###1890 And here's the way I say it.
###1891 And I'm trying to be short.
###1893 You know, in the real world, when a big company goes
###1895 to an ad agency, and the ad agency
###1898 provides all the creative.
###1899 If you like the creative, you buy the advertising.
###1903 If you don't like the creative, you don't buy the advertising.
###1906 Bar business?
###1907 Opposite.
###1908 We buy the advertising with no creative,
###1911 and then at the last minute we get a phone call.
###1913 I need your copy.
###1914 Oh, oh!
###1915 And so the fact of the matter is we
###1917 go at it in a mechanical way.
###1919 And that's what you can't do.
###1920 You've got to make certain that those reactions are created.
###1923 The words, the phrasing, the fonts, the color,
###1926 the positioning-- these are subliminals
###1928 that will either somebody to click through or not.
###1932 And you are a point of difference.
###1935 You guys stand alone.
###1936 You're the shining star in the business.
###1938 Nobody lights a candle to you.
###1940 Bing?
###1941 Come on.
###1942 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###1944 JON TAFFER: The fact that the matter is now
###1946 because you are perceived as so good at what you do, so big,
###1950 the bar is high, isn't it?
###1952 Now I expect more from you, which
###1954 means as we get bigger and better and our reputation
###1957 grows, we've got to deliver stronger.
###1959 So the problem with social marketing
###1960 is an absence of creative generally.
###1963 It's become more mechanical, more logistical,
###1966 very uncreative.
###1967 And some of it is because it's in real time.
###1969 In a newspaper ad, you plan a month ahead of time,
###1971 two months ahead of time.
###1972 You work on your copy work.
###1973 Social marketing, I come up with it today.
###1975 I put it online in 10 minutes.
###1976 There is no planning.
###1978 And the real time nature of it sometimes works against us.
###1981 And then here's the ultimate kicker.
###1984 When I hit you with social marketing
###1985 three or four times in a row and blow it,
###1988 you're going to delete me every time for then on.
###1990 I'll never get you back.
###1992 So we only have one shot.
###1994 I believe in social marketing.
###1995 Either we engage the audience.
###1997 Either we connect with the audience.
###1998 Or we alienate the audience and we will never
###2001 connect with them after that.
###2002 And that's what my experiences are.
###2004 MALE SPEAKER: Nice.
###2005 And some of the big shock moments
###2007 of the show and when fire people.
###2008 And sometimes you get in their face and you throw them out.
###2011 Other times, you're sympathetic.
###2012 You're like, sorry, I have to let you go.
###2014 So how do you choose like you're going to fire
###2017 and how you do it?
###2018 And you're welcome to practice on me
###2019 if you want to fire me [INAUDIBLE] interview.
###2022 JON TAFFER: Well, you know, when you
###2024 were talking earlier about general marketing sciences.
###2027 The bar business is very visual.
###2029 I need to move your eye where I needed to go.
###2033 First, I sell with the eye, then I get my hand into your pocket.
###2036 So I say, with the exterior building.
###2039 If I don't pull your eye, I'm not going to pull your body.
###2041 The front door of a business.
###2042 If I don't pull your eye, I'm not going to pull your body.
###2045 In a Google ad, if I don't pull your eye,
###2047 the copy doesn't mean anything.
###2049 So the fact of the matter is I've
###2050 got to connect and pull you in.
###2053 And there's all sorts of sciences.
###2054 When you walk in the front door of a business,
###2057 your eyes are going to go to the most colorful or brightest spot
###2059 in a room.
###2060 Every time.
###2061 End of discussion.
###2062 So some designer puts a beautiful piece of artwork
###2065 on the wall.
###2065 I'm not making money off that.
###2066 No!
###2067 Put the artwork over there.
###2068 I'm putting what I make money on, where the eye falls.
###2072 So one of the things that do is I
###2074 work very hard on changing eye movement when
###2076 you walk through the door.
###2077 I also know that bars are about meeting people.
###2080 Eye contact.
###2081 So at zero level, in a bar when it's unelevated,
###2084 everybody's at high seating.
###2086 So everybody's eyes are within 10 inches of each other,
###2088 whether you're standing or sitting in a bar stool.
###2091 When people connect, the magic of a bar happens.
###2095 But you've got to look at each other's eyes
###2096 or it never starts.
###2098 So in elevated areas in bars, there's
###2100 a lot of science to this.
###2101 If I have one staircase on an elevation in a bar, what
###2105 happens is you see a pretty girl up there.
###2107 So you go up the steps, you walk, you hit a dead end.
###2110 You feel like an idiot.
###2112 You got to turn around and go back the other way.
###2113 And she knows exactly what you're doing.
###2115 So you never go up there again.
###2116 But with two staircases, I walk through with a purpose
###2120 and go out the other side.
###2121 So it's totally manipulative in every conceivable way.
###2126 I want to manipulate where your eyes go,
###2127 which way you go, where you sit, where you stand.
###2130 And here's the trick to the bar business.
###2132 You can make drinks at home, can't you?
###2134 You don't need me for cocktails.
###2135 You can make exactly what you want.
###2138 In today's world, the technology--
###2139 we can get exactly the programming that I want,
###2142 musically, video, satellite, online.
###2145 I have every entertainment option and everything
###2148 I could ever want at home.
###2150 I don't need you for drinks.
###2151 I don't need you for entertainment.
###2153 There's one thing that you can't get at home that I have.
###2156 And that's social interaction.
###2157 That's my calling card.
###2159 And if I create socially interactive environments,
###2162 people come back.
###2163 And that's where these sciences play in of height and eye
###2165 movement and all of these things.
###2167 It's all about creating interaction.
###2169 MALE SPEAKER: Great.
###2169 So we'll do one last question.
###2171 And then we'll open up to the floor for questions.
###2173 So you just finished Season 3 of "Bar Rescue."
###2176 You just wrote your book.
###2177 What is next for Jon Taffer?
###2179 I have a new show I'm starting in February
###2181 called "The Hungry Investor."
###2183 And I describe it as a cross between "Bar Rescue,"
###2186 "Hell's Kitchen," and "Shark Tank."
###2190 Myself and two partners are traveling
###2193 around the country looking for businesses to invest in.
###2196 So let's say, we decide we want to invest
###2198 in steak houses or any business-- sushi,
###2201 whatever it might be.
###2202 So we might come to LA, pick two steak houses
###2206 that we might want to invest in.
###2208 And I created this formula called an Invest Test. where
###2211 we determine the elasticity and potential of the business
###2214 and individuals in it.
###2215 So we run them through this rigorous and best test process
###2220 to determine there in your business's potential.
###2222 And then at the end of the show, we
###2223 determine which one we're going to invest in it,
###2225 and we give him the money.
###2226 And we make the investment.
###2227 And then we let you know how it did.
###2229 So it's much more business return on investment, equity,
###2234 a little deeper for me.
###2235 It's sort of fun.
###2235 It allows me to show my business knowledge, not just
###2238 my bar knowledge.
###2239 I'm excited about it.
###2240 Then "Bar Rescue," I told you we just
###2242 got picked up just yesterday.
###2244 20 more episodes for us is Season 5.
###2246 So I'm very excited about that.
###2248 MALE SPEAKER: Congratulations.
###2249 JON TAFFER: I just finished my 59th episode yesterday.
###2253 MALE SPEAKER: Great.
###2254 All right, let's open it to questions.
###2255 And there's actually a microphone right over there
###2257 that we can--
###2259 AUDIENCE: So if you had a room full of people,
###2261 what would you tell them in a brief period of time
###2263 to keep them from ever showing up on your show?
###2265 
###2268 JON TAFFER: No excuses.
###2269 If I had to leave you with one message,
###2272 it's understanding that all I'm going to do
###2274 is identify where you're failing.
###2276 You can do that too if you want.
###2277 But you got to look at the mirror
###2279 and say I'm failing because of me-- what am I doing wrong--
###2281 And pick it apart.
###2282 The other thing about the bar business
###2284 is I've seen a lot of bars not fail, but run out of money.
###2289 They would've turned the corner.
###2290 The first restaurant I ever owned by myself
###2292 was called Alamo Grill.
###2293 Actually, second one.
###2294 And Lynn Dickey was the first.
###2296 And I opened it, and about 90 days into it,
###2299 I ran out of money.
###2301 I was losing money in Mall of America.
###2303 And it's because it was a new business,
###2305 and we were so busy that I couldn't make it profitable.
###2309 So I was in trouble.
###2310 So I went and sold 50% of this business
###2313 that I put a million dollars in for $150,000
###2316 to get the money I needed.
###2318 That year, that business profited $800,000,
###2322 and somebody else owned half of it for $150,000.
###2325 It's almost like a football game.
###2327 Vince Lombardi once said, I never lose the game.
###2329 I just run out of time.
###2330 That's very much the bar business.
###2332 If you just had the money for another month or two,
###2334 you could've figured it out and made it.
###2337 And the problem with the bar business is it's all rookies.
###2339 There's no place where you'd go and learn the bar business.
###2342 There's hospitality schools.
###2343 There's no bar school.
###2345 So the bar sciences that I teach-- Google it!
###2349 There's nobody else who teaches these things.
###2351 There's no other books with these things
###2353 that teach these sciences.
###2355 So the fact of the matter is I'm a little unique in what I do,
###2359 but every bar can be successful, if they just
###2362 changed what they do.
###2363 And I'll leave you with a quote from, I believe,
###2366 Benjamin Franklin.
###2367 It says "if you do tomorrow, what you did today,
###2369 you'll get tomorrow which you got today."
###2371 I got to make them do something different tomorrow.
###2374 So do they.
###2375 And the strange thing is they could do that without me.
###2377 But the problem is they blame the president,
###2379 they blame Congress, they blame everything else but themselves.
###2383 And then they go home, mad at somebody else.
###2385 I suggest you should go home mad at yourself.
###2388 MALE SPEAKER: Great Next question.
###2390 AUDIENCE: Where did you get a lot of the data and statistics
###2392 you use, such as if you serve food,
###2394 someone stays 45 minutes longer.
###2396 If you have neon lights, they leave 30 minutes earlier.
###2398 Where do you get that data?
###2400 JON TAFFER: Some of that is industrial.
###2401 For example, the fluorescent lighting is industrial.
###2403 It was actually a study done by General Motors years ago,
###2406 where they changed florescent lighting
###2408 to incandescent lighting.
###2409 And illnesses went down.
###2410 And employee productivity went up.
###2412 And I own a company called GuestProbe.
###2415 And it's not a company that I promote publicly,
###2417 but I have over my 30 years, I have these databases
###2421 with 60,000 restaurants and bars worth of data,
###2424 where I've done these surveys and focus groups.
###2427 So most of this data is owned by me, really, and created by me.
###2431 It's a little unique.
###2432 And it's not out there any place else.
###2435 So for me, I know it's 52 minutes,
###2437 because I've tracked it for 30 years.
###2439 Nobody else has.
###2441 I wish I had a better answer for you.
###2443 But that's the reality of it to.
###2445 They're my own sciences that I test and work.
###2447 And they work every time for me, as you see.
###2450 When I push the buttons, it happens.
###2451 Science is science, but I'm the nutcase who does this stuff.
###2455 And I am.
###2456 I'm a nutcase on this stuff.
###2458 I will spend a fortune to build a video camera
###2461 in the corner behind a piece of mirror,
###2463 just so that I can monitor posture.
###2466 When I open a new bar or restaurant,
###2467 I put a girl in the ladies' room in a stall with a notepad.
###2471 And she sits in there for an hour and a half
###2473 because what you guys say to each other at the mirror
###2475 is gospel.
###2476 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###2477 JON TAFFER: I want to know.
###2479 I want to know what you're saying to each other.
###2481 When do you think of my food?
###2482 What do you think of my environment?
###2483 Do you think the place is safe?
###2484 Do you like the other customers?
###2486 I need to know.
###2487 I have this insatiable addictive need
###2491 to know what's going on in your brain.
###2493 So I use every trick in the book to get to that information.
###2497 So it's 30-year, $60,000 restaurants worth of data.
###2500 It's actually a really neat database,
###2503 even down to the color of plates, flow patterns, hours,
###2507 price, points, for example, psychological pricing.
###2510 And there's no difference in guest perception
###2513 from $8.25 or $8.95.
###2516 Absolutely zero.
###2517 So if you charge $8.25 instead of $8.95, you're leaving what?
###2521 60 cents on a table every time you create a transaction.
###2525 So I can go into a bar, just change the pricing from $8.50
###2528 to $8.95 on all the menu items, move some stuff around,
###2531 not change one recipe and increase revenues by about 20%.
###2535 So that's the science.
###2536 I can box something in the center of a menu
###2539 and sales of that item will go up 20% every single time.
###2543 If I bold it, put Chef's Special on it,
###2545 sales would go up 14% to 17% every single time.
###2549 People have a 6.5% propensity to order
###2552 the top bottom and bottom two items on the list on a menu.
###2556 So what am I going to do?
###2557 I'm going to take my most profitable item,
###2559 box it, shadow it, move it all around, move it at $8.95,
###2562 and manipulate you to buy what I'm making money on.
###2565 If there's a menu item that my customers love,
###2568 that I don't make money on, I hide it,
###2570 so no new customer find it.
###2573 The old customers know I got it.
###2574 I'm not going to take it away from you.
###2575 But I don't want anybody else getting hooked with this thing.
###2577 I want them [CLICKING SOUND].
###2579 So I hide that in the menu, and move my most profitable items.
###2582 It's incredibly manipulative.
###2584 And I had the confidence to do this because of that database.
###2588 Or I probably wouldn't have the confidence
###2590 to make the bold moves that I do sometimes.
###2592 MALE SPEAKER: And what is the name of that invention where
###2593 you have the two rails with just a limited space?
###2596 JON TAFFER: Butt funnel.
###2597 Made a lot of money, a lot of mileage, off the butt fun--
###2600 the concept of the butt funnel, and it's
###2602 for a youthful, high energy nightclub.
###2604 It's a narrow entryway to a dance floor.
###2607 So stand up for a second.
###2608 So if we're going to go in this dance floor,
###2610 we got to sort of go like this.
###2612 Now, with a guy and a girl, it tends
###2614 to work better most of the time, but--
###2616 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###2616 JON TAFFER: The fact is I'm forcing
###2617 their faces to be together.
###2619 I'm forcing eye contact.
###2621 I'm forcing human interaction.
###2623 And butt funneling, I invented about 25 years ago.
###2626 Got a lot of mileage out of the butt funnel.
###2628 MALE SPEAKER: That's great.
###2629 All right, next question.
###2631 AUDIENCE: OK, well, first I have to say, sorry, that I actually
###2634 never watch your show, which I have to start.
###2636 But it sounds like, from your story,
###2639 that the first thing that the owner does is like, oh,
###2641 I don't want to change.
###2642 So I'm curious what your take on this human psychology.
###2645 On the one hand, they obviously apply for the show,
###2647 and they know they're going to be asked for a change.
###2649 But then they don't want to change.
###2651 JON TAFFER: You know, it's interesting,
###2651 when I look at those five minute little casting reels
###2654 that we do, they say stuff like oh, when Taffer gets here,
###2658 he's going to love me.
###2660 I mean he's going to think that I'm as good at this as he is.
###2663 Boy, do they get a surprise when I show up.
###2665 Then the other guy says, oh, boy, if he screams at me,
###2667 I'm going to go at him.
###2669 I just look at him loudly, and he starts crying.
###2671 AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
###2672 JON TAFFER: So they take this posture.
###2675 It's strange.
###2675 And after shooting 59 of them, you'd
###2677 think they know what's coming.
###2679 But the fact of the matter is each one of them
###2682 thinks that they're going to be the one that I'm not
###2685 going to scream at.
###2686 And if you saw Gypsy, the Las Vegas gay bar that we did,
###2690 remember what he says?
###2692 Oh, I got to tell you.
###2692 Jon is going to be my buddy.
###2693 And then after this is all done, he's
###2695 going to go out for a drink, and he's going to say,
###2697 Paul, you were right, and I was wrong.
###2700 Yeah, that didn't quite work out for him as he thought.
###2702 But it's fascinating, that human dynamic that you're
###2706 setting yourself up to be embarrassed
###2708 on national television.
###2710 And here's the unique part of it.
###2713 At the end of the show, they're not really embarrassed,
###2716 are they?
###2717 Nine out of ten episodes, they turn, don't they?
###2720 And nine out of ten episodes, at the end
###2722 you like them, even if they were a total jerk in the beginning.
###2725 Remember, Ami, the guy in Denver that I got in a fight with?
###2728 He called Chef Duffy "fat boy"?
###2731 So I swung at that guy.
###2733 I mean, he infuriated me.
###2735 We fought for three days.
###2737 And he was an Israeli military guy,
###2740 about four feet four inches tall,
###2743 who thought he was about nine foot tall.
###2745 And this guy was an ass.
###2748 And what you didn't see on cameras
###2750 before he said fat boy to Chef Duffy,
###2753 he called his employees assholes.
###2755 So my employees are stupid assholes and your fat boy chef.
###2759 I just won't accept robbing people of their dignity.
###2762 I don't do that.
###2763 And I'll attack what you do, but I rarely
###2767 attack people personally, unless it's a unique situation.
###2770 Make a long story short, at the end, he said,
###2776 I prayed to God for an angel.
###2777 And the angel sent me Jon Taffer.
###2779 So at the end, he redeemed himself.
###2782 And I think that's why they do it,
###2784 is they know at the end of the show
###2785 if they're reasonable at all-- they were jerks along the way,
###2788 but at the end, there's something
###2790 endearing about each of them.
###2791 I think that's the motivation.
###2792 Also, when you're losing a half a million dollars,
###2794 and you've got a family to support,
###2795 that could be pretty motivating too.
###2797 And we do change fortunes.
###2800 AUDIENCE: I have two questions for you.
###2802 One is you're very animated.
###2804 Your body language is unique.
###2806 Have you've studied people for your own body language?
###2809 Is that what you came up with?
###2810 Because even on the show, every move you make seems calculated.
###2814 JON TAFFER: It is.
###2814 AUDIENCE: And it's very empowering and brilliant.
###2818 JON TAFFER: Thank you.
###2819 AUDIENCE: I just recognize it, and it's very empowering, just
###2824 absolutely shocking how much you move.
###2826 JON TAFFER: Thank you.
###2827 And it is.
###2828 It is very contrived.
###2831 I have to have more energy than anybody in the room.
###2834 I've got to drive the energy of the TV show,
###2836 as well as the five days for those employees.
###2839 So my energy is critical to moving the process along.
###2842 So if I have a flu, if I have a fever, nope.
###2845 I got to be on every day.
###2846 I got to lift that energy.
###2848 The other thing is I've got to be loud.
###2850 And the fact of the matter is the things
###2852 that you-- back to your question--
###2853 the things that I say to them have
###2855 been said to them before in many cases.
###2857 But when I say it, they are going to frickin' hear it.
###2861 And I'm not going to allow them not to hear it.
###2863 And these animations, I'm even doing it now,
###2866 are really critical to positioning myself
###2871 above them in their perception.
###2873 And I don't mean above as a human being.
###2875 They need to look up to me, or they're not going to follow me.
###2878 And the animations, the energy, the body language,
###2880 the communication, the eye contact, all of this
###2883 matters to me getting them to slip into that submissive role,
###2887 if you will, and follow my lead.
###2889 AUDIENCE: Your book on tape should be a video.
###2892 JON TAFFER: I have some videos out.
###2893 As a matter of fact, I'm launching in February Taffer
###2895 TV, which we're launching, I just
###2898 built a whole production studio in Las Vegas
###2900 with a 30-foot bar in it.
###2902 So it's a whole educational program
###2904 that we're creating to do that.
###2906 AUDIENCE: Thank you.
###2907 JON TAFFER: You're welcome.
###2908 AUDIENCE: The second question was when you rescue a bar,
###2911 and these people already in financial trouble,
###2914 does the show pick up the renovation?
###2915 JON TAFFER: Yes.
###2916 AUDIENCE: Does the show pick up your fees?
###2917 Is there ever a deal that goes on between--
###2918 JON TAFFER: The show pays for everything.
###2920 The owner pays for nothing.
###2921 AUDIENCE: And they're completely separate once you leave?
###2923 JON TAFFER: Yes, I have no involvement
###2924 in the business when I leave.
###2926 As a matter of fact, probably 80% of them,
###2928 I've never spoken with when I left.
###2931 I will share my email with them.
###2933 If they have questions, they can shoot me an email.
###2935 I give them my books.
###2936 I give them lists of promotions.
###2937 They get a binder about this thick.
###2939 And nine out of ten of them never
###2941 communicate with me ever again.
###2943 And I don't look back, to be honest with you.
###2945 I'm always looking forward at the next one.
###2946 AUDIENCE: One of the best things you ever did on the show
###2949 was when you brought a previous "Bar Rescue" owner in to spy
###2952 for another one.
###2953 That made a big impression.
###2955 JON TAFFER: We're doing a bunch of that this season.
###2956 AUDIENCE: I hope so.
###2957 JON TAFFER: It's fun for me, because A, it
###2959 gives you an update on that bar when
###2961 they tell you how they're doing.
###2962 It shows the relationship I created with them
###2964 that it's real.
###2966 And they went through the experience,
###2968 so they're great candidates to do that.
###2969 You're going to see a lot of that this season.
###2971 AUDIENCE: Great.
###2971 Thank you.
###2972 JON TAFFER: My pleasure.
###2973 MALE SPEAKER: Great.
###2973 So it's actually the last question we have time for.
###2975 Jon, do you have any other final words or final advice
###2979 for some of us?
###2980 JON TAFFER: The only final advice
###2981 I would give you is I've lived a very unconventional life.
###2985 And it's because I live my dream every day.
###2989 Dreams are inspiring.
###2991 Work is not.
###2993 Find a dream.
###2994 Whether it's that client you can't
###2995 get that you've been fighting for six months.
###2999 You got to have dreams.
###3001 Dreams make this world go on.
###3002 It built our whole country.
###3004 And when we get in a rut as human beings
###3008 is when we lose touch with our dreams.
###3011 We lose the ability to fight for those dreams.
###3013 So don't be an employee of Google.
###3015 Live your dreams at Google.
###3017 Find a way to match your dreams with the goals of your company
###3022 in your own work, because there's
###3024 nothing worse than mechanical employees that lost touch
###3029 with their dream.
###3030 The other thing I would say is leadership.
###3034 I'm one of the few people who say this.
###3036 Leadership is not created.
###3038 You can read every leadership book in the world.
###3040 I can't make somebody a leader, if they
###3041 weren't by 12 years old.
###3043 Leadership is a trait that we have, that we're born with.
###3046 The Pied Piper, no, you never read
###3048 what a good musician he was, do you?
###3050 Couldn't play the flute at all, but people followed him
###3052 off the cliff because of who is.
###3053 How many entrepreneurs do people follow
###3055 to bankruptcy that don't know what they're doing?
###3058 Leadership is a trait that is born.
###3061 When you find a great leader, attach yourself to him.
###3064 Ride it to the end, because great leadership
###3067 and your dreams together will take you to the Promised Land.
###3071 And the worst thing in the world is
###3073 when you see somebody who lost touch with their dreams.
###3077 MALE SPEAKER: That's great.
###3078 All right, a round of applause for Jon Taffer.
###3080 Thank you very much.
###3081 AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
