0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,14



2
0:0:0,14 --> 0:0:2,83
JACI BADZIN: Please welcome
to Google New York, Chef Paul


3
0:0:2,83 --> 0:0:3,614
Liebrandt.


4
0:0:3,614 --> 0:0:4,387
[APPLAUSE]


5
0:0:4,387 --> 0:0:5,47
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Thank you.


6
0:0:5,47 --> 0:0:7,1
JACI BADZIN: We're
so glad you're here.


7
0:0:7,1 --> 0:0:7,62
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Thank you very much.


8
0:0:7,62 --> 0:0:8,14
JACI BADZIN: It's an honor.


9
0:0:8,14 --> 0:0:9,52
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Pleasure to be here.


10
0:0:9,52 --> 0:0:11,84
JACI BADZIN: So we're going
to start at the beginning.


11
0:0:11,84 --> 0:0:16,58
So when and how did your
interest in food start?


12
0:0:16,58 --> 0:0:19,14
PAUL LIEBRANDT: When and how.


13
0:0:19,14 --> 0:0:21,92
I would say in my early teens.


14
0:0:21,92 --> 0:0:23,98
I didn't grow up from a
food background at all.


15
0:0:23,98 --> 0:0:28,796
So I had no family in the
business, as a lot of chefs do.


16
0:0:28,796 --> 0:0:30,42
It's something that
they're born into .


17
0:0:30,42 --> 0:0:34,11
So it just happened, growing
up in the central London,


18
0:0:34,11 --> 0:0:36,32
I grew mostly at
Chinatown, so I guess maybe


19
0:0:36,32 --> 0:0:38,96
that had some connection
to food there.


20
0:0:38,96 --> 0:0:44,392
But I would say 12, 13,
14, around that age.


21
0:0:44,392 --> 0:0:45,85
JACI BADZIN: And
your first job was


22
0:0:45,85 --> 0:0:47,76
at New York, New York in London.


23
0:0:47,76 --> 0:0:50,3
So besides that being a
sign of what was to come--


24
0:0:50,3 --> 0:0:50,776
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Kind
of telling, yeah.


25
0:0:50,776 --> 0:0:51,526
JACI BADZIN: Yeah.


26
0:0:51,526 --> 0:0:53,669
What was the biggest
challenge of your early years?


27
0:0:53,669 --> 0:0:55,71
PAUL LIEBRANDT: At working
in New York, New York?


28
0:0:55,71 --> 0:0:58,6
JACI BADZIN: Yeah.


29
0:0:58,6 --> 0:1:0,355
PAUL LIEBRANDT: When
I was a dishwasher--


30
0:1:0,355 --> 0:1:0,74
JACI BADZIN: That's--


31
0:1:0,74 --> 0:1:2,56
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
--working illegally,


32
0:1:2,56 --> 0:1:5,61
at 14 years old, because you're
supposed to be 16, so I lied.


33
0:1:5,61 --> 0:1:8,34
I'm a tall guy, so
they believed me.


34
0:1:8,34 --> 0:1:10,82
But the challenges?


35
0:1:10,82 --> 0:1:11,29
It wasn't really a challenge.


36
0:1:11,29 --> 0:1:11,92
It was fun.


37
0:1:11,92 --> 0:1:16,75
I mean, I was 14 years
old, and it was fun.


38
0:1:16,75 --> 0:1:17,59
It's just fun.


39
0:1:17,59 --> 0:1:18,97
JACI BADZIN: That's interesting.


40
0:1:18,97 --> 0:1:20,675
My first job was in a kitchen.


41
0:1:20,675 --> 0:1:22,13
It was actually--
was a waitress.


42
0:1:22,13 --> 0:1:23,24
I don't remember
it being that fun.


43
0:1:23,24 --> 0:1:24,92
But I'm glad that
you had fun with it.


44
0:1:24,92 --> 0:1:27,87
It's probably why you're
this amazing chef.


45
0:1:27,87 --> 0:1:30,13
So you mentioned
that you started


46
0:1:30,13 --> 0:1:32,615
working in kitchens at 14.


47
0:1:32,615 --> 0:1:35,17
And you spent a lot
of your teenage years


48
0:1:35,17 --> 0:1:36,47
in these restaurant kitchens.


49
0:1:36,47 --> 0:1:39,4



50
0:1:39,4 --> 0:1:40,48
What are some of
the biggest ways


51
0:1:40,48 --> 0:1:43,1
that shaped who you are today?


52
0:1:43,1 --> 0:1:44,95
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Well, I think anybody


53
0:1:44,95 --> 0:1:47,43
that works in the kitchen,
in a professional kitchen,


54
0:1:47,43 --> 0:1:50,29
will tell you that it really
sharpens you up, especially


55
0:1:50,29 --> 0:1:52,16
in early age when
you're surrounded


56
0:1:52,16 --> 0:1:56,19
in a very high pressure,
highly detailed environment,


57
0:1:56,19 --> 0:1:58,38
it tends to mature
you very quick.


58
0:1:58,38 --> 0:2:3,6
So you tend to see that chefs in
general around the globe, when


59
0:2:3,6 --> 0:2:4,91
you meet them
they're very sharp.


60
0:2:4,91 --> 0:2:6,54
It's just the nature
of the business.


61
0:2:6,54 --> 0:2:8,3
You have to be.


62
0:2:8,3 --> 0:2:9,944
So it matured me
very quick, quicker


63
0:2:9,944 --> 0:2:12,36
than I would have done if I
had gone the traditional route


64
0:2:12,36 --> 0:2:15,2
of going to college,
et cetera, et cetera.


65
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:21,53
So professionally, I started at
15 and went from there, really.


66
0:2:21,53 --> 0:2:23,1
Didn't stop.


67
0:2:23,1 --> 0:2:27,3
JACI BADZIN: So talking
about your teenage years,


68
0:2:27,3 --> 0:2:28,747
not only do you have
a passion for food,


69
0:2:28,747 --> 0:2:30,33
but you also have a
passion for music.


70
0:2:30,33 --> 0:2:30,79
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Hmm!


71
0:2:30,79 --> 0:2:31,24
Absolutely.


72
0:2:31,24 --> 0:2:33,573
JACI BADZIN: And something
that I found very interesting


73
0:2:33,573 --> 0:2:36,67
was that this passion that
you'd become a DJ at illegal


74
0:2:36,67 --> 0:2:38,91
raves in the early '90s.


75
0:2:38,91 --> 0:2:39,79
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yes.


76
0:2:39,79 --> 0:2:40,498
JACI BADZIN: Yes.


77
0:2:40,498 --> 0:2:41,56
Very fun time.


78
0:2:41,56 --> 0:2:44,11
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
That was fun, yes.


79
0:2:44,11 --> 0:2:46,2
JACI BADZIN: Do you
see any similarities


80
0:2:46,2 --> 0:2:50,62
for how you mixed music back
then and how you create food?


81
0:2:50,62 --> 0:2:53,985



82
0:2:53,985 --> 0:2:55,36
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Well, the process


83
0:2:55,36 --> 0:2:57,61
of DJing an illegal rave
is you'd find a space,


84
0:2:57,61 --> 0:3:0,885
break in illegally, phone
a number on a Friday night


85
0:3:0,885 --> 0:3:2,26
and everybody
would just show up.


86
0:3:2,26 --> 0:3:5,19
So restaurants aren't quite--
well, maybe they are the same,


87
0:3:5,19 --> 0:3:9,91
but restaurants are a little
more organized than that.


88
0:3:9,91 --> 0:3:13,97
The mixing part of it, to me
it's about taking two things


89
0:3:13,97 --> 0:3:17,4
and creating something
new and different


90
0:3:17,4 --> 0:3:19,92
from two things which
already existed.


91
0:3:19,92 --> 0:3:21,75
So whether we take a
carrot and a parsnip,


92
0:3:21,75 --> 0:3:23,55
and we make something
out of it or we


93
0:3:23,55 --> 0:3:26,31
take a rhythm of one
track or another,


94
0:3:26,31 --> 0:3:28,11
and we mix them into
creating something


95
0:3:28,11 --> 0:3:30,65
else-- the technique and
the feel and the sensibility


96
0:3:30,65 --> 0:3:32,44
is the same.


97
0:3:32,44 --> 0:3:37,11
And it's about using your
senses and your intuition


98
0:3:37,11 --> 0:3:39,37
with what's there
in front of you


99
0:3:39,37 --> 0:3:41,34
and creating your own
personal twist on it.


100
0:3:41,34 --> 0:3:43,76
So for me, yeah, there's
a lot of similarity


101
0:3:43,76 --> 0:3:46,4
in that aspect of it, yes.


102
0:3:46,4 --> 0:3:49,67
Not the illegal aspect,
just the food part of it.


103
0:3:49,67 --> 0:3:51,21
JACI BADZIN: Well,
I bet you would


104
0:3:51,21 --> 0:3:54,164
have an amazing underground
food dining restaurant.


105
0:3:54,164 --> 0:3:55,83
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Damn,
it was fun though.


106
0:3:55,83 --> 0:3:56,689
Yeah.


107
0:3:56,689 --> 0:3:57,98
JACI BADZIN: It was a fun time.


108
0:3:57,98 --> 0:4:0,17
And yes, I am old
enough to remember that.


109
0:4:0,17 --> 0:4:1,22
Many of you here aren't.


110
0:4:1,22 --> 0:4:4,33
But it was a pretty fun time.


111
0:4:4,33 --> 0:4:6,17
If you could go back
to your early years,


112
0:4:6,17 --> 0:4:7,65
is there a restaurant
or location


113
0:4:7,65 --> 0:4:10,52
that you would train at?


114
0:4:10,52 --> 0:4:13,6
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yes.


115
0:4:13,6 --> 0:4:16,3
There was a very, very
famous chef in France


116
0:4:16,3 --> 0:4:20,43
called Alain Chapel, who
passed away far too early,


117
0:4:20,43 --> 0:4:24,8
in his early '50s in Mionnay,
in the middle of France.


118
0:4:24,8 --> 0:4:26,5
It was before my time.


119
0:4:26,5 --> 0:4:32,3
But that was one of those great,
great chefs who really turned


120
0:4:32,3 --> 0:4:35,84
classical French cooking and
put his creative spin on it


121
0:4:35,84 --> 0:4:38,4
in a way which nobody
had really seen.


122
0:4:38,4 --> 0:4:42,17
I mean, Ducasse
trained with him.


123
0:4:42,17 --> 0:4:45,52
This was the gentlemen that
really redefined what today--


124
0:4:45,52 --> 0:4:48,43
our generation
and the generation


125
0:4:48,43 --> 0:4:52,2
before us really do with
food, the creative aspect.


126
0:4:52,2 --> 0:4:54,719
So for me, that is the one
gentleman that I would have


127
0:4:54,719 --> 0:4:57,26
loved to-- I would have actually
just eaten at his restaurant


128
0:4:57,26 --> 0:5:0,13
while he was still
there, but I was far too


129
0:5:0,13 --> 0:5:1,31
young to obviously do it.


130
0:5:1,31 --> 0:5:4,5
But yes, that would
be the gentleman.


131
0:5:4,5 --> 0:5:5,95
JACI BADZIN: That's amazing.


132
0:5:5,95 --> 0:5:9,51
So talking about the
book for a bit-- so you


133
0:5:9,51 --> 0:5:12,64
say that this book
isn't quite a memoir.


134
0:5:12,64 --> 0:5:14,32
And it's not a cookbook.


135
0:5:14,32 --> 0:5:16,702
But you call it a
literary tasting menu.


136
0:5:16,702 --> 0:5:17,91
PAUL LIEBRANDT: It's correct.


137
0:5:17,91 --> 0:5:19,76
JACI BADZIN: It's very cool.


138
0:5:19,76 --> 0:5:21,89
Can you tell us what that means?


139
0:5:21,89 --> 0:5:23,92
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Well, a
literary tasting menu.


140
0:5:23,92 --> 0:5:27,43



141
0:5:27,43 --> 0:5:29,67
As with a tasting
menu, as with anything


142
0:5:29,67 --> 0:5:33,3
where there are
multiple scenes or there


143
0:5:33,3 --> 0:5:37,2
are multiple choruses or
rhythms or whatever to it,


144
0:5:37,2 --> 0:5:38,465
it tells a story.


145
0:5:38,465 --> 0:5:41,29
And that's the most
important part of it.


146
0:5:41,29 --> 0:5:44,317
A tasting menu, when you
have a great tasting menu,


147
0:5:44,317 --> 0:5:46,4
There should be a beginning,
a middle, and an end.


148
0:5:46,4 --> 0:5:48,287
And there's ebb and
flow to the whole thing,


149
0:5:48,287 --> 0:5:50,87
much the same way as when you
go and see an opera or something


150
0:5:50,87 --> 0:5:51,97
similar.


151
0:5:51,97 --> 0:5:54,37
So the book, we wanted to
have the same feel to it.


152
0:5:54,37 --> 0:5:56,8
It's not a memoir,
because I'm simply not


153
0:5:56,8 --> 0:5:57,23
old enough to have that.


154
0:5:57,23 --> 0:5:58,66
It's a story.


155
0:5:58,66 --> 0:6:0,31
It's not a cookbook,
because I didn't


156
0:6:0,31 --> 0:6:4,4
want to do 100 recipes in
pictures like a textbook.


157
0:6:4,4 --> 0:6:8,52
So it's something which tells
a story in a narrative that


158
0:6:8,52 --> 0:6:11,32
is something that you
could follow through


159
0:6:11,32 --> 0:6:13,89
like a tasting menu
and arrive at the end


160
0:6:13,89 --> 0:6:16,49
and make your own mind up on
whether you enjoyed it or not.


161
0:6:16,49 --> 0:6:17,67
JACI BADZIN: Well, I
think it's definitely--


162
0:6:17,67 --> 0:6:19,961
PAUL LIEBRANDT: It's definitely
isn't one or the other.


163
0:6:19,961 --> 0:6:22,61
It's something which we
tried to do which would--


164
0:6:22,61 --> 0:6:23,56
I wouldn't say break
the mold, but I


165
0:6:23,56 --> 0:6:26,5
would say do something
different, not do the same.


166
0:6:26,5 --> 0:6:28,18
JACI BADZIN: It's
definitely different.


167
0:6:28,18 --> 0:6:30,695
It's definitely--
reading the book,


168
0:6:30,695 --> 0:6:34,11
I hadn't experienced something
like that with it's your story,


169
0:6:34,11 --> 0:6:36,43
but then you have
these beautiful photos.


170
0:6:36,43 --> 0:6:38,68
And then there's recipes
that are ingrained,


171
0:6:38,68 --> 0:6:40,78
but they don't
overpower the book,


172
0:6:40,78 --> 0:6:42,68
I think your story
definitely shines.


173
0:6:42,68 --> 0:6:44,77
And the images are amazing.


174
0:6:44,77 --> 0:6:46,15
It's a really beautiful book.


175
0:6:46,15 --> 0:6:50,34
There's great imagery, between
the food that you create


176
0:6:50,34 --> 0:6:52,62
and these great shots that
are taken in the kitchen.


177
0:6:52,62 --> 0:6:54,22
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
We had Evan Song,


178
0:6:54,22 --> 0:6:57,83
who's a genius photographer,
do the beautiful, beautiful


179
0:6:57,83 --> 0:6:58,33
photographs.


180
0:6:58,33 --> 0:7:0,34
And I said that he
makes my job easy,


181
0:7:0,34 --> 0:7:4,22
because he makes it look far
better than I think it actually


182
0:7:4,22 --> 0:7:5,45
is.


183
0:7:5,45 --> 0:7:8,696
JACI BADZIN: How long
did you work on the book?


184
0:7:8,696 --> 0:7:10,82
PAUL LIEBRANDT: About three
years, start to finish.


185
0:7:10,82 --> 0:7:12,444
JACI BADZIN: That
actually seems pretty


186
0:7:12,444 --> 0:7:14,95
quick for a book of that size.


187
0:7:14,95 --> 0:7:16,26
PAUL LIEBRANDT: We work quick.


188
0:7:16,26 --> 0:7:17,982
JACI BADZIN: Yes, you do.


189
0:7:17,982 --> 0:7:20,44
Another point in your book,
which I thought was interesting


190
0:7:20,44 --> 0:7:23,13
is you reference
food as "the food."


191
0:7:23,13 --> 0:7:24,91
Can you describe
what that difference


192
0:7:24,91 --> 0:7:29,16
is for you between
food and the food?


193
0:7:29,16 --> 0:7:32,45
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I would say
it harks back to maybe a more


194
0:7:32,45 --> 0:7:37,41
classic kind of approach, where
for me what I do for a living--


195
0:7:37,41 --> 0:7:39,25
I still feel this I
will [INAUDIBLE]--


196
0:7:39,25 --> 0:7:41,75
it's there's a
reference for what I do.


197
0:7:41,75 --> 0:7:43,74
The food.


198
0:7:43,74 --> 0:7:46,23
The vocational act
of the profession


199
0:7:46,23 --> 0:7:49,79
that I've chosen is to
nourish, is to feed people.


200
0:7:49,79 --> 0:7:50,88
It's very basic.


201
0:7:50,88 --> 0:7:51,72
It's a basic thing.


202
0:7:51,72 --> 0:7:54,11
But there's something which
is very reverent about it.


203
0:7:54,11 --> 0:7:57,96
And for me, the
food, I feel honored


204
0:7:57,96 --> 0:8:0,15
to be able to do
this for a living.


205
0:8:0,15 --> 0:8:4,17
So when I say the food, I
say it in a very respectful


206
0:8:4,17 --> 0:8:9,43
and very almost-- I
would say religious term


207
0:8:9,43 --> 0:8:14,74
of it's something which I
do to please other people.


208
0:8:14,74 --> 0:8:15,78
It's not just a job.


209
0:8:15,78 --> 0:8:16,51
It's not food.


210
0:8:16,51 --> 0:8:19,3
It's something I
hold much higher.


211
0:8:19,3 --> 0:8:20,209
JACI BADZIN: An art.


212
0:8:20,209 --> 0:8:21,5
PAUL LIEBRANDT: No, not an art.


213
0:8:21,5 --> 0:8:22,43
It's a craft.


214
0:8:22,43 --> 0:8:24,16
JACI BADZIN: I was going
to say and then I felt art.


215
0:8:24,16 --> 0:8:25,12
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yes,
there's artistic.


216
0:8:25,12 --> 0:8:25,99
Of course there is.


217
0:8:25,99 --> 0:8:26,82
The aesthetic is--


218
0:8:26,82 --> 0:8:28,62
JACI BADZIN: The food
on the plate is artwork.


219
0:8:28,62 --> 0:8:30,12
PAUL LIEBRANDT: But
this is a craft.


220
0:8:30,12 --> 0:8:32,87
As an artist, I can come in
one day and cook a great meal


221
0:8:32,87 --> 0:8:35,89
and then not come back the
next day and not have to do it.


222
0:8:35,89 --> 0:8:37,64
Because that's art.


223
0:8:37,64 --> 0:8:39,659
As a craftsman,
which I view myself


224
0:8:39,659 --> 0:8:44,13
as a craftsman, albeit maybe an
artistic craftsman, every day


225
0:8:44,13 --> 0:8:47,35
I have to come in and
deliver to the same level.


226
0:8:47,35 --> 0:8:49,72
Because that's where the
consistency and that's where


227
0:8:49,72 --> 0:8:51,92
the expectation for
the guest comes in.


228
0:8:51,92 --> 0:8:53,98
So for me that's
really what it's about.


229
0:8:53,98 --> 0:8:55,86
And it's a long process.


230
0:8:55,86 --> 0:8:58,24
And it takes
decades and decades.


231
0:8:58,24 --> 0:9:0,53
But it's that continual
just chipping away.


232
0:9:0,53 --> 0:9:3,35
As somebody who's a sculptor,
just everything they do


233
0:9:3,35 --> 0:9:5,81
is just they're chipping
away to get the perfect form.


234
0:9:5,81 --> 0:9:7,17
Or a painter.


235
0:9:7,17 --> 0:9:9,4
It doesn't happen overnight.


236
0:9:9,4 --> 0:9:13,706
So for me, the reverence, the
rigor, all of that, the food.


237
0:9:13,706 --> 0:9:15,33
JACI BADZIN: The food.


238
0:9:15,33 --> 0:9:16,24
You do it very well.


239
0:9:16,24 --> 0:9:17,888
PAUL LIEBRANDT: We try hard.


240
0:9:17,888 --> 0:9:19,77
JACI BADZIN: You succeed.


241
0:9:19,77 --> 0:9:22,9
So the book guides
us through some


242
0:9:22,9 --> 0:9:25,16
of the most famed restaurant
kitchens in the world.


243
0:9:25,16 --> 0:9:27,7
Are there any crazy stories
that you excluded from the book


244
0:9:27,7 --> 0:9:28,82
that you can share with us now?


245
0:9:28,82 --> 0:9:29,9
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Many,
many, many, many.


246
0:9:29,9 --> 0:9:30,52
Yes.


247
0:9:30,52 --> 0:9:33,61
JACI BADZIN: Can you share one
of your favorites with us now?


248
0:9:33,61 --> 0:9:34,895



249
0:9:34,895 --> 0:9:36,77
PAUL LIEBRANDT: But this
is going on YouTube,


250
0:9:36,77 --> 0:9:38,978
so there'll be like children
and stuff watching this,


251
0:9:38,978 --> 0:9:42,523
so I shouldn't
really say anything


252
0:9:42,523 --> 0:9:44,8
that might get me in trouble.


253
0:9:44,8 --> 0:9:45,704
JACI BADZIN: Not to
get you in trouble.


254
0:9:45,704 --> 0:9:47,5
Maybe one of your
favorite stories


255
0:9:47,5 --> 0:9:48,642
from when you were younger?


256
0:9:48,642 --> 0:9:50,1
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
When I was younger.


257
0:9:50,1 --> 0:9:53,5
Gosh, those were the days.


258
0:9:53,5 --> 0:9:59,9
So when I was working back
in London, one that I do


259
0:9:59,9 --> 0:10:5,35
remember-- and you know,
the great British actors--


260
0:10:5,35 --> 0:10:8,35
they have a very-- there's
a quirkiness about them


261
0:10:8,35 --> 0:10:10,34
if you ever meet any of
the great British ones.


262
0:10:10,34 --> 0:10:14,49
Richard Harris, who played
Dumbledore in the first "Harry


263
0:10:14,49 --> 0:10:17,22
Potter" films was
one of those guys.


264
0:10:17,22 --> 0:10:19,382
And I worked at a
restaurant called L'Escargot


265
0:10:19,382 --> 0:10:21,9
in London, still
there-- beautiful place,


266
0:10:21,9 --> 0:10:22,83
been there since 1927.


267
0:10:22,83 --> 0:10:24,65
Grand, classical--
but a very small one.


268
0:10:24,65 --> 0:10:26,7
Almost like a big townhouse.


269
0:10:26,7 --> 0:10:28,22
So I was in the top
restaurant, very small.


270
0:10:28,22 --> 0:10:30,65
And there were only three
of us in the kitchen.


271
0:10:30,65 --> 0:10:33,73
And Richard Harris
comes in one night


272
0:10:33,73 --> 0:10:38,99
and-- this is obviously
before "Harry Potter" films--


273
0:10:38,99 --> 0:10:44,67
and came into the kitchen and
proceeded to take his shirt off


274
0:10:44,67 --> 0:10:47,8
and asked everybody if he could
bum a cigarette off everybody.


275
0:10:47,8 --> 0:10:50,3
I don't even smoke, so I
couldn't help him there.


276
0:10:50,3 --> 0:10:51,53
But took his shirt
off-- and I think


277
0:10:51,53 --> 0:10:55,53
he was kind of drunk-- took
his shirt off-- it was summer.


278
0:10:55,53 --> 0:10:59,0
He said he was hot-- and when
he said can I have a cigarette,


279
0:10:59,0 --> 0:11:1,34
in the middle of us
cooking his dinner,


280
0:11:1,34 --> 0:11:4,31
and then walked out of the
restaurant, down the street,


281
0:11:4,31 --> 0:11:6,92
asking everybody on the street
apparently, so I was told,


282
0:11:6,92 --> 0:11:9,342
and the maitre d' had to chase
after him and lead him back


283
0:11:9,342 --> 0:11:10,3
to the restaurant and--


284
0:11:10,3 --> 0:11:10,855
JACI BADZIN: That's amazing.


285
0:11:10,855 --> 0:11:12,355
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
--take him upstairs.


286
0:11:12,355 --> 0:11:14,12
But he's no longer with us.


287
0:11:14,12 --> 0:11:15,77
God bless him, so
I can say that one.


288
0:11:15,77 --> 0:11:18,14
But there are a lot more
but, again, children


289
0:11:18,14 --> 0:11:19,49
might watch this, so I don't
want to offend any parents.


290
0:11:19,49 --> 0:11:20,56
JACI BADZIN: That's a great one.


291
0:11:20,56 --> 0:11:22,65
And it's a great "Harry
Potter" reference [INAUDIBLE]


292
0:11:22,65 --> 0:11:23,317
do for the kids.


293
0:11:23,317 --> 0:11:25,816
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah, I mean,
"Harry Potter," it's all true.


294
0:11:25,816 --> 0:11:26,43
It's all true.


295
0:11:26,43 --> 0:11:28,885
You know, that was my
childhood growing up in London.


296
0:11:28,885 --> 0:11:30,91
JACI BADZIN: That's so great.


297
0:11:30,91 --> 0:11:33,54
Something else in the
book you talk about


298
0:11:33,54 --> 0:11:35,95
is your experience at
a "Star Wars" marathon


299
0:11:35,95 --> 0:11:36,784
when you were a kid.


300
0:11:36,784 --> 0:11:37,783
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Oh yeah.


301
0:11:37,783 --> 0:11:40,0
JACI BADZIN: And how you
were drawn to Darth Vader.


302
0:11:40,0 --> 0:11:41,708
And I thought it was
an interesting story


303
0:11:41,708 --> 0:11:43,5
to find in a chef's book.


304
0:11:43,5 --> 0:11:46,19
So many Googlers here,
I'm sure you know,


305
0:11:46,19 --> 0:11:48,45
are "Star Wars" fans,
so I have to ask


306
0:11:48,45 --> 0:11:50,94
why does that moment
stand out for you?


307
0:11:50,94 --> 0:11:53,189
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Because it
was a "Star Wars" marathon.


308
0:11:53,189 --> 0:11:54,82



309
0:11:54,82 --> 0:11:56,83
This is what? '83 when
"Return of the Jedi"


310
0:11:56,83 --> 0:11:59,6
came out, so I was
seven years old.


311
0:11:59,6 --> 0:12:0,635
And it was my birthday.


312
0:12:0,635 --> 0:12:3,17
And my father-- there was an
old theatre called the Dominion


313
0:12:3,17 --> 0:12:5,85
Theatre, a very famous theatre
at the beginning of Tottenham


314
0:12:5,85 --> 0:12:6,46
Court Road.


315
0:12:6,46 --> 0:12:8,422
And they had the trilogy on.


316
0:12:8,422 --> 0:12:9,63
And they had all three films.


317
0:12:9,63 --> 0:12:11,435
And it had been timed
with the release


318
0:12:11,435 --> 0:12:13,76
of "Return of the Jedi."


319
0:12:13,76 --> 0:12:15,337
And my brother
said, right, we're


320
0:12:15,337 --> 0:12:16,42
going to go watch a movie.


321
0:12:16,42 --> 0:12:17,63
And I went, great, OK.


322
0:12:17,63 --> 0:12:20,57
So then we went for eight
hours or whatever it was,


323
0:12:20,57 --> 0:12:24,27
of just watching
all three in a row.


324
0:12:24,27 --> 0:12:25,63
And it was memorable.


325
0:12:25,63 --> 0:12:26,21
Oh yeah.


326
0:12:26,21 --> 0:12:26,94
JACI BADZIN: I can imagine.


327
0:12:26,94 --> 0:12:28,315
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
I wouldn't says I


328
0:12:28,315 --> 0:12:29,97
was drawn to Darth
Vader in particular,


329
0:12:29,97 --> 0:12:32,8
just the whole vision of
the whole thing I think


330
0:12:32,8 --> 0:12:34,534
is quite stunning,
quite stunning.


331
0:12:34,534 --> 0:12:36,7
JACI BADZIN: Are you still
a fan of the "Star Wars."


332
0:12:36,7 --> 0:12:40,38
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I can't
wait for next year or 2016


333
0:12:40,38 --> 0:12:42,8
or whenever it is when
they do the new one.


334
0:12:42,8 --> 0:12:43,944
Oh, JJ Abrams's doing it.


335
0:12:43,944 --> 0:12:45,11
I'm very excited about that.


336
0:12:45,11 --> 0:12:46,1
JACI BADZIN: I actually
didn't know that.


337
0:12:46,1 --> 0:12:48,42
Did anybody here know that
JJ Abrams was doing the--


338
0:12:48,42 --> 0:12:49,46
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
JJ is of course--


339
0:12:49,46 --> 0:12:50,2
JACI BADZIN: Yeah, of
course, who am I kidding?


340
0:12:50,2 --> 0:12:50,92
Everybody's like yes.


341
0:12:50,92 --> 0:12:53,58



342
0:12:53,58 --> 0:12:55,44
You're in good company here.


343
0:12:55,44 --> 0:12:58,9
So what was your favorite
discovery writing this book?


344
0:12:58,9 --> 0:13:0,74
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
It's kind of funny.


345
0:13:0,74 --> 0:13:2,68
It's like when we did the movie.


346
0:13:2,68 --> 0:13:5,42
We filmed the movie over
10 years, 9 and 1/2 years.


347
0:13:5,42 --> 0:13:10,25
So when you talk about your past
and then you compile it over


348
0:13:10,25 --> 0:13:13,1
time, and then when
you look back on it,


349
0:13:13,1 --> 0:13:15,302
you learn something
about yourself.


350
0:13:15,302 --> 0:13:17,26
So whether it be from a
narrative point of view


351
0:13:17,26 --> 0:13:20,1
with the book, where I'm talking
about things that I hadn't


352
0:13:20,1 --> 0:13:24,17
thought about in years, but
for the purposes of this story


353
0:13:24,17 --> 0:13:26,29
that we were compiling
here, we were


354
0:13:26,29 --> 0:13:28,174
talking about it, and
memories and things.


355
0:13:28,174 --> 0:13:29,59
And the same thing
with the movie.


356
0:13:29,59 --> 0:13:31,215
When you look at
yourself from a decade


357
0:13:31,215 --> 0:13:33,22
ago-- when you kind
of cringe and go oof,


358
0:13:33,22 --> 0:13:36,67
really-- you learn a lot.


359
0:13:36,67 --> 0:13:38,89
Some good, some bad,
some things which


360
0:13:38,89 --> 0:13:41,83
inspire you for the future.


361
0:13:41,83 --> 0:13:43,4
My love of Chinese
food, I guess,


362
0:13:43,4 --> 0:13:44,94
I know where it comes from now.


363
0:13:44,94 --> 0:13:45,3
JACI BADZIN: Yeah.


364
0:13:45,3 --> 0:13:45,91
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah.


365
0:13:45,91 --> 0:13:46,88
JACI BADZIN: Growing
up near Chinatown.


366
0:13:46,88 --> 0:13:47,94
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah,
directly opposite.


367
0:13:47,94 --> 0:13:48,69
JACI BADZIN: Yeah.


368
0:13:48,69 --> 0:13:51,12
It's very cool.


369
0:13:51,12 --> 0:13:54,37
What is one cookbook,
besides your own,


370
0:13:54,37 --> 0:13:55,62
that people should have?


371
0:13:55,62 --> 0:13:57,68
Well, actually, yours is
a literary tasting menu,


372
0:13:57,68 --> 0:14:1,5
but besides that book, what
is in a book about food


373
0:14:1,5 --> 0:14:6,851
or a cookbook that
people should own?


374
0:14:6,851 --> 0:14:8,6
PAUL LIEBRANDT: One
of the first cookbooks


375
0:14:8,6 --> 0:14:10,433
I ever bought, and
again, I wouldn't call it


376
0:14:10,433 --> 0:14:12,48
a necessary
cookbook, but for me,


377
0:14:12,48 --> 0:14:15,54
what sold me on the
profession of what I do now


378
0:14:15,54 --> 0:14:19,71
was "White Heat" by Marco
Pierre White, which again,


379
0:14:19,71 --> 0:14:22,76
the visual aspect of it--
because cooking, by nature,


380
0:14:22,76 --> 0:14:24,2
is a repetitive act.


381
0:14:24,2 --> 0:14:25,8
You come every day.


382
0:14:25,8 --> 0:14:26,322
You do the same thing.


383
0:14:26,322 --> 0:14:28,78
And that's good, because that's
the nature of the business.


384
0:14:28,78 --> 0:14:30,77
You get better by doing that.


385
0:14:30,77 --> 0:14:33,93
But a cookbook is
the same thing.


386
0:14:33,93 --> 0:14:37,7
If it's 100 pages and 100
recipes and 100 pictures,


387
0:14:37,7 --> 0:14:38,757
and you flip through,
it can look good


388
0:14:38,757 --> 0:14:40,9
and you can reference something.


389
0:14:40,9 --> 0:14:41,34
But generally you put it back.


390
0:14:41,34 --> 0:14:42,548
You put it back on the shelf.


391
0:14:42,548 --> 0:14:44,73
And it sits in a
lovely collection.


392
0:14:44,73 --> 0:14:46,86
"White Heat," at
least for me, and I


393
0:14:46,86 --> 0:14:49,17
think for a few other
people, was the first book


394
0:14:49,17 --> 0:14:50,88
where it wasn't like that.


395
0:14:50,88 --> 0:14:53,96
There was stunning food
shots and stunning recipes,


396
0:14:53,96 --> 0:14:56,54
but Bob Carlos Clarke's
beautiful photography


397
0:14:56,54 --> 0:14:58,75
of really capturing
what it's like to be


398
0:14:58,75 --> 0:15:0,17
in a professional kitchen.


399
0:15:0,17 --> 0:15:3,82
The sweat, the blood,
the tears, the tension,


400
0:15:3,82 --> 0:15:5,7
you see it in the photographs.


401
0:15:5,7 --> 0:15:6,84
It was the first
thing for me that


402
0:15:6,84 --> 0:15:9,2
really said I want to do that.


403
0:15:9,2 --> 0:15:10,77
That's what I want to do.


404
0:15:10,77 --> 0:15:12,58
I want to make my
life in the kitchen.


405
0:15:12,58 --> 0:15:14,72
And most people would
look at it and go "oof,"


406
0:15:14,72 --> 0:15:16,13
because it's gruesome.


407
0:15:16,13 --> 0:15:17,3
I mean, it's grueling.


408
0:15:17,3 --> 0:15:18,58
It looks grueling.


409
0:15:18,58 --> 0:15:19,27
No.


410
0:15:19,27 --> 0:15:21,17
I was enveloped by it.


411
0:15:21,17 --> 0:15:22,91
So for me, I think
that is the book


412
0:15:22,91 --> 0:15:25,42
that any young cook
should look at.


413
0:15:25,42 --> 0:15:27,374
And it's a very,
very realistic view


414
0:15:27,374 --> 0:15:29,54
of what it's like to work
in a professional kitchen.


415
0:15:29,54 --> 0:15:30,63
JACI BADZIN: It is.


416
0:15:30,63 --> 0:15:32,172
People say that it was one
of-- like you're saying,


417
0:15:32,172 --> 0:15:32,73
it's a first.


418
0:15:32,73 --> 0:15:33,8
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Iconic.


419
0:15:33,8 --> 0:15:33,44
JACI BADZIN: Yeah.


420
0:15:33,44 --> 0:15:34,56
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
It's iconic, yeah.


421
0:15:34,56 --> 0:15:35,45
It broke the mold.


422
0:15:35,45 --> 0:15:35,95
It did.


423
0:15:35,95 --> 0:15:38,9
Before that, it was the sort
of typical portly French chef


424
0:15:38,9 --> 0:15:41,22
with the giant white hat,
standing there like this,


425
0:15:41,22 --> 0:15:43,155
with a cockerel under his arm.


426
0:15:43,155 --> 0:15:44,31
And that's wonderful.


427
0:15:44,31 --> 0:15:45,44
But that's not real.


428
0:15:45,44 --> 0:15:49,91
The realisms are it's sweaty,
it's hot, you're tired,


429
0:15:49,91 --> 0:15:53,78
you're undernourished, you
have wet hands all the time.


430
0:15:53,78 --> 0:15:54,67
You cut yourself.


431
0:15:54,67 --> 0:15:55,9
People scream at you.


432
0:15:55,9 --> 0:15:57,5
That's the kitchen.


433
0:15:57,5 --> 0:15:59,3
It is what it is.


434
0:15:59,3 --> 0:16:1,96
I mean, that's the nature of
the business that we're in.


435
0:16:1,96 --> 0:16:4,0
Thank God it's
gotten better than


436
0:16:4,0 --> 0:16:6,39
when I first started
over 20 years ago.


437
0:16:6,39 --> 0:16:9,87
But I still think that it's
important to understand


438
0:16:9,87 --> 0:16:12,62
the building blocks of
why we do what we do.


439
0:16:12,62 --> 0:16:15,5
We're there to cook for people.


440
0:16:15,5 --> 0:16:20,39
JACI BADZIN: Did you see in
kitchens and kitchens style,


441
0:16:20,39 --> 0:16:25,312
kitchen etiquette, between
London and Europe and New York?


442
0:16:25,312 --> 0:16:26,52
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Very much so.


443
0:16:26,52 --> 0:16:32,96
I think Europe has more--
just simply because Europe


444
0:16:32,96 --> 0:16:35,41
has more of an
older lineage when


445
0:16:35,41 --> 0:16:38,57
it comes to culinary history
that this country does, just


446
0:16:38,57 --> 0:16:40,34
by the nature of it's Europe.


447
0:16:40,34 --> 0:16:45,3
I mean, you see that the
French brigade system is still


448
0:16:45,3 --> 0:16:46,28
very much ingrained.


449
0:16:46,28 --> 0:16:48,96
And the whole reason for
me coming to this country,


450
0:16:48,96 --> 0:16:50,75
and to New York
specifically, was


451
0:16:50,75 --> 0:16:52,9
I wanted to get away from that.


452
0:16:52,9 --> 0:16:55,17
It's like growing up in the
class system in England.


453
0:16:55,17 --> 0:16:58,62
Your place in life and
you'll never get any higher,


454
0:16:58,62 --> 0:17:2,19
because you're not born into
a certain kind of hierarchy.


455
0:17:2,19 --> 0:17:4,94
It's changed now because,
you know, the world changes.


456
0:17:4,94 --> 0:17:7,53
But kitchens-- the
difference is very


457
0:17:7,53 --> 0:17:9,2
much like that in a kitchen.


458
0:17:9,2 --> 0:17:10,39
You work for the right people.


459
0:17:10,39 --> 0:17:12,13
And then you've
got the totem pole.


460
0:17:12,13 --> 0:17:14,21
Here, the refreshing
thing is it really


461
0:17:14,21 --> 0:17:19,69
is-- you make it on your
own work for the most part.


462
0:17:19,69 --> 0:17:22,41
But there's a big
difference there.


463
0:17:22,41 --> 0:17:22,91
Europe.


464
0:17:22,91 --> 0:17:25,109
I think it's changing
more now, in regards


465
0:17:25,109 --> 0:17:27,94
to more young chefs doing
their own personal style, which


466
0:17:27,94 --> 0:17:29,71
is great.


467
0:17:29,71 --> 0:17:32,43
And the world is obviously
a much bigger place


468
0:17:32,43 --> 0:17:33,29
in terms of that.


469
0:17:33,29 --> 0:17:35,24
There's more options now.


470
0:17:35,24 --> 0:17:38,467
So kitchens have definitely
changed a lot, for the better.


471
0:17:38,467 --> 0:17:40,55
JACI BADZIN: What about
when you came to New York?


472
0:17:40,55 --> 0:17:43,73
What was one of the biggest
surprises or biggest challenges


473
0:17:43,73 --> 0:17:51,68
that you faced as a non-American
in a New York kitchen?


474
0:17:51,68 --> 0:17:54,62
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Well, A, my accent.


475
0:17:54,62 --> 0:17:58,83
And vice-- and I talk about
this in the book-- vice versa.


476
0:17:58,83 --> 0:18:4,7
Me understanding the
American terminology,


477
0:18:4,7 --> 0:18:6,39
especially working with
people from California


478
0:18:6,39 --> 0:18:10,69
who would have this very sort
of bro-speak kind of way, which


479
0:18:10,69 --> 0:18:12,95
I had no idea what
they were saying.


480
0:18:12,95 --> 0:18:15,24
I remember there's a gentleman
that I worked at Poulet


481
0:18:15,24 --> 0:18:18,844
and he was working on
this side of the stove.


482
0:18:18,844 --> 0:18:20,51
I was working on this
side of the stove.


483
0:18:20,51 --> 0:18:25,46
And he would look at me and say,
hey, guy, can I take my guy,


484
0:18:25,46 --> 0:18:27,155
and write it in your guy?


485
0:18:27,155 --> 0:18:30,88
When I [STAMMERING]-- like what?


486
0:18:30,88 --> 0:18:33,77
That translated into can
I take this piece of lamb


487
0:18:33,77 --> 0:18:36,764
and braise it in the
choux that you're making?


488
0:18:36,764 --> 0:18:39,18
I didn't know that, because
everyone else seemed to, but I


489
0:18:39,18 --> 0:18:39,83
didn't.


490
0:18:39,83 --> 0:18:40,33
True story.


491
0:18:40,33 --> 0:18:41,38
JACI BADZIN: Wow.


492
0:18:41,38 --> 0:18:41,99
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah.


493
0:18:41,99 --> 0:18:43,156
But little things like that.


494
0:18:43,156 --> 0:18:46,73
And my terminology-- so
that actually sounds silly,


495
0:18:46,73 --> 0:18:49,91
but when you're in a
kitchen, it's quick.


496
0:18:49,91 --> 0:18:49,59
Like this.


497
0:18:49,59 --> 0:18:50,39
All the time.


498
0:18:50,39 --> 0:18:52,47
And you've got to be very
sharp and on the ball.


499
0:18:52,47 --> 0:18:54,95
And a lot of it is
sensibility, like I say,


500
0:18:54,95 --> 0:18:58,48
where you have a good team of
guys and girls in the kitchen.


501
0:18:58,48 --> 0:18:59,54
And there's that look.


502
0:18:59,54 --> 0:19:1,2
It's that sensibility.


503
0:19:1,2 --> 0:19:2,25
It's a nod.


504
0:19:2,25 --> 0:19:4,9
And you know, if there's
course adjustments--


505
0:19:4,9 --> 0:19:6,69
service is like going to war.


506
0:19:6,69 --> 0:19:9,67
You plan, but as soon as you
go into it, things change.


507
0:19:9,67 --> 0:19:10,74
You have to adapt.


508
0:19:10,74 --> 0:19:15,53
So I think that was
actually, for me, a big one.


509
0:19:15,53 --> 0:19:18,7
And also people eat
very quickly here,


510
0:19:18,7 --> 0:19:21,21
as opposed to Europe,
because in Europe, you


511
0:19:21,21 --> 0:19:23,63
go to a fine restaurant,
you're there for the night.


512
0:19:23,63 --> 0:19:24,52
Right?


513
0:19:24,52 --> 0:19:26,51
Three, four hours-- normal.


514
0:19:26,51 --> 0:19:27,81
And that's part decor.


515
0:19:27,81 --> 0:19:29,8
Here, it's hour
and a half, bang.


516
0:19:29,8 --> 0:19:30,49
You want to go.


517
0:19:30,49 --> 0:19:32,32
And the volume aspect.


518
0:19:32,32 --> 0:19:35,59
Fine dining in Europe-- you
go to a beautiful restaurant.


519
0:19:35,59 --> 0:19:38,2
It's 30 covers, 30
people, 40 people.


520
0:19:38,2 --> 0:19:39,4
That's it.


521
0:19:39,4 --> 0:19:41,546
Here, it was like
100 plus people.


522
0:19:41,546 --> 0:19:42,67
I'm like, how do you do it?


523
0:19:42,67 --> 0:19:44,83
Organization.


524
0:19:44,83 --> 0:19:45,92
That's how you do it.


525
0:19:45,92 --> 0:19:48,497
So I think that was a
big one, big one for me.


526
0:19:48,497 --> 0:19:50,33
JACI BADZIN: That's
really interesting thing


527
0:19:50,33 --> 0:19:54,84
about that differentiation and
then also-- I mean, it is true.


528
0:19:54,84 --> 0:19:57,71
I forget how fast we eat.


529
0:19:57,71 --> 0:19:59,87
Sometimes in New York, a
little bit slower, maybe.


530
0:19:59,87 --> 0:20:3,74
But yeah, it is a definite
different experience,


531
0:20:3,74 --> 0:20:5,68
which translates to
the kitchen in such


532
0:20:5,68 --> 0:20:7,638
a completely different
way, in terms of covers.


533
0:20:7,638 --> 0:20:11,1
PAUL LIEBRANDT: You have to
work in a very different way.


534
0:20:11,1 --> 0:20:14,37
JACI BADZIN: So kind of
talking more about present,


535
0:20:14,37 --> 0:20:18,87
do you feel that dining in
general is being repositioned?


536
0:20:18,87 --> 0:20:21,45
PAUL LIEBRANDT: As far as--


537
0:20:21,45 --> 0:20:24,53
JACI BADZIN: Fine dining,
more of casual dining.


538
0:20:24,53 --> 0:20:27,95
Do you think that there's
still a place for fine dining?


539
0:20:27,95 --> 0:20:29,676
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Of course.


540
0:20:29,676 --> 0:20:30,175
Absolutely.


541
0:20:30,175 --> 0:20:32,55
JACI BADZIN: And if so, how
is it being redefined though.


542
0:20:32,55 --> 0:20:35,33
PAUL LIEBRANDT: You
know, this is the thing.


543
0:20:35,33 --> 0:20:38,79
In any form, there's
a building block.


544
0:20:38,79 --> 0:20:41,96
So art, there's a building
block of fine art.


545
0:20:41,96 --> 0:20:43,69
Music, same thing.


546
0:20:43,69 --> 0:20:51,6
Winemaking, the folks at
Petrus make Petrus wine


547
0:20:51,6 --> 0:20:53,78
the same way that they
did 100 years ago.


548
0:20:53,78 --> 0:20:58,58
Is it going to go out of
fashion 50 years from now?


549
0:20:58,58 --> 0:20:59,324
I don't think so.


550
0:20:59,324 --> 0:21:1,74
I think it's going to be harder
for them with the climate.


551
0:21:1,74 --> 0:21:4,7
But I think it's not going
to go out of fashion.


552
0:21:4,7 --> 0:21:7,35
The way I look upon it is
like any great art form,


553
0:21:7,35 --> 0:21:9,41
let's say, like
opera, for example.


554
0:21:9,41 --> 0:21:11,185
100 years ago, people
went to the opera.


555
0:21:11,185 --> 0:21:12,56
When they went to
the opera, they


556
0:21:12,56 --> 0:21:14,96
wore top hat, white
gloves, tails, cane,


557
0:21:14,96 --> 0:21:17,51
because that's what you did
when you went to the opera.


558
0:21:17,51 --> 0:21:22,907
You go to the same opera here
that was playing 100 years ago,


559
0:21:22,907 --> 0:21:24,74
people don't want wear
gloves and a top hat.


560
0:21:24,74 --> 0:21:26,698
But they'll put on a suit
and they'll enjoy it.


561
0:21:26,698 --> 0:21:30,12
But they still want the
same feel, the sensibility.


562
0:21:30,12 --> 0:21:32,13
They want the same
idea that they're


563
0:21:32,13 --> 0:21:35,45
going to see something which
is classic and beautiful.


564
0:21:35,45 --> 0:21:36,88
Fine dining is the same.


565
0:21:36,88 --> 0:21:38,67
I think there will
always be room


566
0:21:38,67 --> 0:21:42,43
for well prepared,
good ingredients


567
0:21:42,43 --> 0:21:47,4
and expertly crafted
product, like a sports car,


568
0:21:47,4 --> 0:21:48,1
like anything.


569
0:21:48,1 --> 0:21:48,92
There's room for it.


570
0:21:48,92 --> 0:21:52,35
But how people approach it and
how they want to experience


571
0:21:52,35 --> 0:21:55,3
it is different.


572
0:21:55,3 --> 0:21:56,3
You talk about fine dining.


573
0:21:56,3 --> 0:21:58,424
I think it's very interesting
that you look at now,


574
0:21:58,424 --> 0:22:3,28
the younger people experience
fine dining at an earlier age


575
0:22:3,28 --> 0:22:5,51
now than they did,
let's say, 40 years ago,


576
0:22:5,51 --> 0:22:8,69
where if you went to a
fine dining restaurant,


577
0:22:8,69 --> 0:22:10,107
of like a Michelin
three-star, you


578
0:22:10,107 --> 0:22:11,606
would look at the
dining room and it


579
0:22:11,606 --> 0:22:13,1
would be a certain age group.


580
0:22:13,1 --> 0:22:15,95
It would be an older
clientele, because that


581
0:22:15,95 --> 0:22:17,49
was what could afford it.


582
0:22:17,49 --> 0:22:22,1
And that was what was deemed
as like that's what you do.


583
0:22:22,1 --> 0:22:25,784
Nowadays, the dynamic's changed.


584
0:22:25,784 --> 0:22:27,7
Younger people have more
money in their pocket


585
0:22:27,7 --> 0:22:30,42
than they do 50 years ago.


586
0:22:30,42 --> 0:22:31,65
They can afford it.


587
0:22:31,65 --> 0:22:34,7
And people want to
experience that.


588
0:22:34,7 --> 0:22:38,85
And so the way that you
change your new rhythm of how


589
0:22:38,85 --> 0:22:41,81
you do a restaurant of
the style that we do


590
0:22:41,81 --> 0:22:47,51
is you got to make it seem
attractive to a younger


591
0:22:47,51 --> 0:22:50,2
clientele, to a more worldly
clientele, because people


592
0:22:50,2 --> 0:22:51,71
travel around the
world now solely


593
0:22:51,71 --> 0:22:54,64
for gastronomic experiences.


594
0:22:54,64 --> 0:22:55,52
You go on holiday.


595
0:22:55,52 --> 0:22:57,59
You have eating experiences.


596
0:22:57,59 --> 0:23:1,77
So if you go to Hong Kong or
Asia-- I mean, I do it too.


597
0:23:1,77 --> 0:23:4,15
You make a list of the
restaurants you want to go to,


598
0:23:4,15 --> 0:23:8,911
as opposed to maybe 50 years
ago, it was sites or a museum.


599
0:23:8,911 --> 0:23:9,66
Do you understand?


600
0:23:9,66 --> 0:23:10,67
JACI BADZIN: It's very true.


601
0:23:10,67 --> 0:23:11,295
That's so true.


602
0:23:11,295 --> 0:23:13,45
PAUL LIEBRANDT: So
the dynamic of how


603
0:23:13,45 --> 0:23:18,64
we produce what we produce, how
we do it, the setting the feel,


604
0:23:18,64 --> 0:23:21,81
the tone, the touch, all of it,
we have to move with the times.


605
0:23:21,81 --> 0:23:23,98
And I think there's
nothing wrong with that.


606
0:23:23,98 --> 0:23:25,32
That's normal.


607
0:23:25,32 --> 0:23:27,67
So it's not a question of
that fine dining's dying.


608
0:23:27,67 --> 0:23:29,6
It's not a question that
people don't want it.


609
0:23:29,6 --> 0:23:31,86
It's a question of
how you approach it,


610
0:23:31,86 --> 0:23:33,72
how you deliver it.


611
0:23:33,72 --> 0:23:37,2
A nicely cooked piece of fish
is still a nicely cooked piece


612
0:23:37,2 --> 0:23:39,89
of fish that people can enjoy.


613
0:23:39,89 --> 0:23:44,605
It's a question
that a lot of people


614
0:23:44,605 --> 0:23:46,57
would probably disagree with me.


615
0:23:46,57 --> 0:23:49,2
But that's the way I see it.


616
0:23:49,2 --> 0:23:49,94
And it's a good thing.


617
0:23:49,94 --> 0:23:51,23
It's a relevant thing.


618
0:23:51,23 --> 0:23:53,352
You know, it's forward thinking.


619
0:23:53,352 --> 0:23:54,81
JACI BADZIN: Do
you see this more--


620
0:23:54,81 --> 0:23:58,25
do you see it being
redefined on a global scale


621
0:23:58,25 --> 0:24:1,4
or do you think that it's
going to be national,


622
0:24:1,4 --> 0:24:2,42
that what we could
see in New York


623
0:24:2,42 --> 0:24:5,21
is going to be vastly different
than what we'd see in London?


624
0:24:5,21 --> 0:24:5,79
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Oh, no, no, no.


625
0:24:5,79 --> 0:24:6,687
It's a global.


626
0:24:6,687 --> 0:24:7,27
It's a global.


627
0:24:7,27 --> 0:24:9,18
If you travel around
the world and you eat,


628
0:24:9,18 --> 0:24:11,33
you see that what
people do in London


629
0:24:11,33 --> 0:24:15,57
is echoing of what we do here
in New York, and vice versa.


630
0:24:15,57 --> 0:24:18,795
And you go to Hong Kong,
you see restaurants


631
0:24:18,795 --> 0:24:21,92
that are echoing what is
happening in Spain or France.


632
0:24:21,92 --> 0:24:24,34
And it's a global thing.


633
0:24:24,34 --> 0:24:28,53
It's not one particular
part of the world or city.


634
0:24:28,53 --> 0:24:30,96
What I think is
very interesting is


635
0:24:30,96 --> 0:24:34,42
different cultures and
different ways of eating


636
0:24:34,42 --> 0:24:35,91
and the sort of
cross pollination


637
0:24:35,91 --> 0:24:39,34
when it comes to a style
of cuisine blending


638
0:24:39,34 --> 0:24:41,19
with a French-style cuisine.


639
0:24:41,19 --> 0:24:45,6
For example, Ferran
Adria with elBulli


640
0:24:45,6 --> 0:24:49,53
and the whole Spanish movement
of very molecular, very


641
0:24:49,53 --> 0:24:52,99
technique-driven, very
almost pastry-driven style


642
0:24:52,99 --> 0:24:56,1
of cooking, redefining the
entire way that we organize


643
0:24:56,1 --> 0:24:59,34
our kitchens ourselves
and how we approach food


644
0:24:59,34 --> 0:25:1,84
and taking away
the dogmatic view


645
0:25:1,84 --> 0:25:4,34
of a French-style of eating.


646
0:25:4,34 --> 0:25:7,88
Now it's morphed into
a Nordic kind of thing.


647
0:25:7,88 --> 0:25:10,53
And the next one is going
to be South America.


648
0:25:10,53 --> 0:25:13,9
And that brings a new
world to us as chefs


649
0:25:13,9 --> 0:25:17,71
and to customers, because that
makes ingredients, for example,


650
0:25:17,71 --> 0:25:23,33
in the Amazonian basin,
which it is becoming


651
0:25:23,33 --> 0:25:26,66
and will be the next big global
trend available to people


652
0:25:26,66 --> 0:25:30,41
globally, which
people had no idea.


653
0:25:30,41 --> 0:25:32,1
I doubt most people--
I mean, maybe


654
0:25:32,1 --> 0:25:35,122
you have, but have had
fresh cashew nut pulp.


655
0:25:35,122 --> 0:25:36,8
JACI BADZIN: I haven't.


656
0:25:36,8 --> 0:25:38,34
Anybody here?


657
0:25:38,34 --> 0:25:40,2
PAUL LIEBRANDT: It's unlike--
you can't describe it.


658
0:25:40,2 --> 0:25:42,19
It doesn't taste
anything like the nut.


659
0:25:42,19 --> 0:25:45,26
But it's one thing which
is very, very specific


660
0:25:45,26 --> 0:25:46,65
to that part of the world.


661
0:25:46,65 --> 0:25:48,67
Things like this,
which-- it's great.


662
0:25:48,67 --> 0:25:49,42
It's a good thing.


663
0:25:49,42 --> 0:25:50,17
It's how we learn.


664
0:25:50,17 --> 0:25:52,69
It's how food evolves.


665
0:25:52,69 --> 0:25:54,97
And I think it's a
really exciting time.


666
0:25:54,97 --> 0:25:56,91
JACI BADZIN: That's
very, very true.


667
0:25:56,91 --> 0:25:59,372
I want to try that, for sure.


668
0:25:59,372 --> 0:26:0,83
Think we can get
it here at Google?


669
0:26:0,83 --> 0:26:2,75
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I'm sure
Google can source it.


670
0:26:2,75 --> 0:26:4,791
JACI BADZIN: [LAUGHS] I
bet Google can source it.


671
0:26:4,791 --> 0:26:6,2



672
0:26:6,2 --> 0:26:9,1
So in this digital
age, how do you


673
0:26:9,1 --> 0:26:11,8
see technology changing
the way you cook


674
0:26:11,8 --> 0:26:14,27
and how you approach food?


675
0:26:14,27 --> 0:26:15,98
Do you see it having
any effects on how


676
0:26:15,98 --> 0:26:19,19
the kitchen is run concurrently?


677
0:26:19,19 --> 0:26:21,2
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Absolutely.


678
0:26:21,2 --> 0:26:24,997
Technology has always gone
hand in hand with cooking,


679
0:26:24,997 --> 0:26:27,455
whether it be the hard equipment
that we use in the kitchen


680
0:26:27,455 --> 0:26:31,7
or whether it be the precision
elements like sous vides,


681
0:26:31,7 --> 0:26:33,43
for example.


682
0:26:33,43 --> 0:26:37,43
The apparatus to get
good consistent results


683
0:26:37,43 --> 0:26:38,83
is now more affordable.


684
0:26:38,83 --> 0:26:40,86
It's easy to use.


685
0:26:40,86 --> 0:26:44,29
| I think that right there
is technology working


686
0:26:44,29 --> 0:26:47,73
for the betterment
of us as chefs.


687
0:26:47,73 --> 0:26:49,81
And then we pass our
results on to the consumer.


688
0:26:49,81 --> 0:26:53,96
So they have experience in
the hands of a skilled chef.


689
0:26:53,96 --> 0:26:58,96
I think what is very interesting
is the sensory aspect of dining


690
0:26:58,96 --> 0:27:2,21
and technology and how that
translates to the future,


691
0:27:2,21 --> 0:27:4,91
and how it will
translate to the future.


692
0:27:4,91 --> 0:27:10,99
Andoni just at Madrid
Fusion presented on this app


693
0:27:10,99 --> 0:27:13,7
that you can smell.


694
0:27:13,7 --> 0:27:13,83
JACI BADZIN: Wow.


695
0:27:13,83 --> 0:27:15,17
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Like scratch
and sniff kind of thing


696
0:27:15,17 --> 0:27:15,947
on your phone.


697
0:27:15,947 --> 0:27:16,78
JACI BADZIN: No way.


698
0:27:16,78 --> 0:27:17,65
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah.


699
0:27:17,65 --> 0:27:20,316
That you can plug it in, and you
can scratch it and it will give


700
0:27:20,316 --> 0:27:23,102
you smells like when
you're reading a book.


701
0:27:23,102 --> 0:27:25,6
I'm not saying that we're
all going to do that,


702
0:27:25,6 --> 0:27:28,97
but I think at least it's
an interesting idea, that


703
0:27:28,97 --> 0:27:30,99
can morph into something else.


704
0:27:30,99 --> 0:27:34,7
I think if you look at, let's
say, the espuma kind of stuff,


705
0:27:34,7 --> 0:27:37,97
a siphon, like a
cream dispenser.


706
0:27:37,97 --> 0:27:40,43
20 years ago, Ferran
was the first guy really


707
0:27:40,43 --> 0:27:41,98
to really utilize that.


708
0:27:41,98 --> 0:27:45,19
A whipped cream dispenser with
a cartridge which you put in,


709
0:27:45,19 --> 0:27:47,97
which was used for whipped
cream, and flavor it, and then


710
0:27:47,97 --> 0:27:50,89
doing hot and cold
and different things.


711
0:27:50,89 --> 0:27:53,1
It's a whip cream dispenser.


712
0:27:53,1 --> 0:27:56,3
Nowadays, any modern
kitchen globally has one.


713
0:27:56,3 --> 0:27:59,32
Because it's the same
as a pot or a pan.


714
0:27:59,32 --> 0:28:1,27
You have to have
one, because it's


715
0:28:1,27 --> 0:28:5,3
become part of that
necessary apparatus.


716
0:28:5,3 --> 0:28:7,51
So I think that was
technology right there,


717
0:28:7,51 --> 0:28:8,7
and how it led into.


718
0:28:8,7 --> 0:28:13,33
Sous vide is becoming or has
become, in every modern kitchen


719
0:28:13,33 --> 0:28:14,86
around the globe,
the same thing.


720
0:28:14,86 --> 0:28:18,13
So it's very, very important.


721
0:28:18,13 --> 0:28:20,0
We use it, always have done.


722
0:28:20,0 --> 0:28:21,41
I think it's important.


723
0:28:21,41 --> 0:28:25,11
But ultimately, the best
technology is what's in here.


724
0:28:25,11 --> 0:28:25,92
And what--


725
0:28:25,92 --> 0:28:27,6
JACI BADZIN: What's
there and here.


726
0:28:27,6 --> 0:28:27,893
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yes.


727
0:28:27,893 --> 0:28:29,44
Exactly.


728
0:28:29,44 --> 0:28:33,54
JACI BADZIN: So along
the lines of technology,


729
0:28:33,54 --> 0:28:36,42
not so much
technically speaking,


730
0:28:36,42 --> 0:28:40,79
but this film-- I want to
bring up the film that you did.


731
0:28:40,79 --> 0:28:43,8
And the documentary
that was made about you


732
0:28:43,8 --> 0:28:47,42
and the current day and age,
how everything is so real time,


733
0:28:47,42 --> 0:28:50,43
and everyone wants
to be on TV or film,


734
0:28:50,43 --> 0:28:55,38
or have that kind of fame after
you, if you will, celebrity.


735
0:28:55,38 --> 0:28:58,4
What would you tell them
about your experience


736
0:28:58,4 --> 0:29:0,82
of being in an HBO documentary?


737
0:29:0,82 --> 0:29:3,84



738
0:29:3,84 --> 0:29:9,15
Did it have any effect on your
life as a chef, on your career?


739
0:29:9,15 --> 0:29:13,16
Was there parts of it that
you wish would not have been--


740
0:29:13,16 --> 0:29:15,61
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
First, let me explain,


741
0:29:15,61 --> 0:29:20,56
because we did this documentary
but A, when we started


742
0:29:20,56 --> 0:29:22,85
filming-- the director,
Sally, started filming,


743
0:29:22,85 --> 0:29:25,51
it was never meant
to be a documentary.


744
0:29:25,51 --> 0:29:28,92
It was simply she's
a documentary maker,


745
0:29:28,92 --> 0:29:30,1
and she just wanted to film.


746
0:29:30,1 --> 0:29:33,11
It wasn't a grand scheme of
compiling everything and making


747
0:29:33,11 --> 0:29:34,15
a movie.


748
0:29:34,15 --> 0:29:38,8
She just was interested
in-- she didn't really know.


749
0:29:38,8 --> 0:29:41,372
And it went on for
years and years.


750
0:29:41,372 --> 0:29:42,83
And I mean like
five years into it,


751
0:29:42,83 --> 0:29:44,538
I forgot that we're
even doing something.


752
0:29:44,538 --> 0:29:47,55
I was just-- that's Sally.


753
0:29:47,55 --> 0:29:49,46
She's filming.


754
0:29:49,46 --> 0:29:52,13
One day she'll do something
with the 500 hours of footage


755
0:29:52,13 --> 0:29:53,26
she has.


756
0:29:53,26 --> 0:29:55,301
Ava and her classmates
talk about the fives years


757
0:29:55,301 --> 0:29:56,64
compiled it into a movie.


758
0:29:56,64 --> 0:30:2,79
And HBO saw it as
a pre-screening


759
0:30:2,79 --> 0:30:3,9
and bought it and sold it.


760
0:30:3,9 --> 0:30:6,1
So we didn't start
out-- and there


761
0:30:6,1 --> 0:30:9,1
was no plan to say this
is going to be on TV,


762
0:30:9,1 --> 0:30:11,3
and we want to be
famous or none of that,


763
0:30:11,3 --> 0:30:15,91
which is very different
from Food TV, so you speak.


764
0:30:15,91 --> 0:30:19,33
And I don't strive
for that personally.


765
0:30:19,33 --> 0:30:20,836
So I think there's
a balance there.


766
0:30:20,836 --> 0:30:21,71
There's a difference.


767
0:30:21,71 --> 0:30:24,46
Again, we made a movie,
and it was really


768
0:30:24,46 --> 0:30:28,12
a story about a young
person in a big city--


769
0:30:28,12 --> 0:30:32,44
and it could be someone who's
in any industry, especially


770
0:30:32,44 --> 0:30:36,301
any creative industry, artist or
musician or actor or whatever--


771
0:30:36,301 --> 0:30:38,8
and the trials and tribulations
of just living life and that


772
0:30:38,8 --> 0:30:40,28
was it.


773
0:30:40,28 --> 0:30:42,285
And so it was like
in a narrative.


774
0:30:42,285 --> 0:30:45,306
I thought they did a
fantastic job on it.


775
0:30:45,306 --> 0:30:51,84
And I think that it-- I wouldn't
say changed my life at all.


776
0:30:51,84 --> 0:30:55,71
We get recognized a lot,
which is sometimes fun


777
0:30:55,71 --> 0:30:57,46
and sometimes not.


778
0:30:57,46 --> 0:31:0,29
But I think more than
that, I'm happy to share


779
0:31:0,29 --> 0:31:2,85
my life and my story
with other people


780
0:31:2,85 --> 0:31:6,54
out there in the world who,
as when we put the movie out,


781
0:31:6,54 --> 0:31:7,65
I find are very similar.


782
0:31:7,65 --> 0:31:9,65
There's a lot of people
out there globally.


783
0:31:9,65 --> 0:31:11,24
And we toured with
the movie-- Europe


784
0:31:11,24 --> 0:31:14,1
and South America and Australia.


785
0:31:14,1 --> 0:31:18,18
And there's a lot of symbiotic
things with other people


786
0:31:18,18 --> 0:31:20,11
other cultures,
other profession.


787
0:31:20,11 --> 0:31:23,54
They can say, hey, I
thought it was just me.


788
0:31:23,54 --> 0:31:25,55
I'm in that position now.


789
0:31:25,55 --> 0:31:28,18
How do you, and
looking at the film,


790
0:31:28,18 --> 0:31:33,8
help them give them inspiration
to-- maybe, I don't know,


791
0:31:33,8 --> 0:31:35,77
go through the door that they
were not willing to go through.


792
0:31:35,77 --> 0:31:39,45
So for me, that's the
most important part of it.


793
0:31:39,45 --> 0:31:41,6
And a young chef
that's saw it and said,


794
0:31:41,6 --> 0:31:45,43
you've inspired me to
want to do this and really


795
0:31:45,43 --> 0:31:46,682
do it for a living.


796
0:31:46,682 --> 0:31:47,89
I was having second thoughts.


797
0:31:47,89 --> 0:31:49,598
It's a hard business,
that kind of thing.


798
0:31:49,598 --> 0:31:54,88
And if anything, I think that
is the bigger payoff for me,


799
0:31:54,88 --> 0:31:56,52
personally.


800
0:31:56,52 --> 0:32:0,56
I think that's nice,
giving back, you know.


801
0:32:0,56 --> 0:32:4,4
JACI BADZIN: So you have
done a movie, written a book.


802
0:32:4,4 --> 0:32:5,85
You've been working
in restaurants


803
0:32:5,85 --> 0:32:9,16
since you were 14, 15.


804
0:32:9,16 --> 0:32:12,14
You were a DJ.


805
0:32:12,14 --> 0:32:14,48
What could possibly be next?


806
0:32:14,48 --> 0:32:16,37
What is next?


807
0:32:16,37 --> 0:32:18,99
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Well, I'm training


808
0:32:18,99 --> 0:32:20,722
to be an amateur
barber, actually.


809
0:32:20,722 --> 0:32:21,555
JACI BADZIN: Really.


810
0:32:21,555 --> 0:32:23,55
PAUL LIEBRANDT: No,
I'm [INAUDIBLE].


811
0:32:23,55 --> 0:32:24,26
I'm just joking.


812
0:32:24,26 --> 0:32:26,532
JACI BADZIN: I was
like, naturally.


813
0:32:26,532 --> 0:32:28,99
And you're going to spin the
music in your barber shop too.


814
0:32:28,99 --> 0:32:31,46
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I know,
whilst frying some eggs.


815
0:32:31,46 --> 0:32:35,67
You know, look,
ultimately, I'm a chef.


816
0:32:35,67 --> 0:32:38,18
I'm a cook is the
way I view myself.


817
0:32:38,18 --> 0:32:42,27
I get a thrill every
day when I-- and I have


818
0:32:42,27 --> 0:32:45,41
my guys here and my girls
there, and they'll tell you,


819
0:32:45,41 --> 0:32:48,1
I get that thrill of
walking in and standing next


820
0:32:48,1 --> 0:32:51,4
to them, and the touch, the
taste, the feel and cooking


821
0:32:51,4 --> 0:32:54,79
and in seeing the plate go out
and looking at the customer


822
0:32:54,79 --> 0:32:57,87
and seeing their reaction and
the emotion in that first taste


823
0:32:57,87 --> 0:33:1,85
and the smell and the smile,
and that kind of sit back


824
0:33:1,85 --> 0:33:1,71
and they think.


825
0:33:1,71 --> 0:33:3,54
And then you see it.


826
0:33:3,54 --> 0:33:7,7
You see it when you feed someone
and the joy you can bring.


827
0:33:7,7 --> 0:33:10,404
That is my goal is to
continue doing that,


828
0:33:10,404 --> 0:33:12,7
because that's the
business that I'm in.


829
0:33:12,7 --> 0:33:16,16



830
0:33:16,16 --> 0:33:18,15
If the barber thing
takes off, I don't know.


831
0:33:18,15 --> 0:33:22,35
But I think ultimately,
I'm a cook at heart.


832
0:33:22,35 --> 0:33:24,94
I'm just a cook.


833
0:33:24,94 --> 0:33:27,0
JACI BADZIN: Well, a
very skilled and amazing


834
0:33:27,0 --> 0:33:30,204
artistically-crafted
cook at that.


835
0:33:30,204 --> 0:33:32,12
So I've just got a couple
more questions here.


836
0:33:32,12 --> 0:33:35,93
And we're going to open it up
for Q&A just a couple minutes,


837
0:33:35,93 --> 0:33:37,32
and there's mics
in the audience.


838
0:33:37,32 --> 0:33:39,82
Anybody have any questions?


839
0:33:39,82 --> 0:33:42,81
So I like to wrap
up these interviews


840
0:33:42,81 --> 0:33:47,63
with a "finish this
sentence" style of approach.


841
0:33:47,63 --> 0:33:49,365
So I've got a
couple here for you.


842
0:33:49,365 --> 0:33:50,44
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Please.


843
0:33:50,44 --> 0:33:53,3
JACI BADZIN: Today is
Abraham Lincoln's birthday.


844
0:33:53,3 --> 0:33:55,17
If you were to cook
him a birthday dinner,


845
0:33:55,17 --> 0:33:56,496
what would it be?


846
0:33:56,496 --> 0:33:58,996
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Well, it would
have to be something British,


847
0:33:58,996 --> 0:33:59,87
wouldn't it?


848
0:33:59,87 --> 0:34:2,462
Maybe like a revolutionary
hot pot or somebody like that.


849
0:34:2,462 --> 0:34:3,662
JACI BADZIN: I like that.


850
0:34:3,662 --> 0:34:5,12
PAUL LIEBRANDT: A
red coat hot pot.


851
0:34:5,12 --> 0:34:6,453
JACI BADZIN: A red coat hot pot.


852
0:34:6,453 --> 0:34:7,53
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah.


853
0:34:7,53 --> 0:34:9,73
JACI BADZIN: I think
you should do it.


854
0:34:9,73 --> 0:34:13,53
The bank or music that best
represents your food is?


855
0:34:13,53 --> 0:34:16,927



856
0:34:16,927 --> 0:34:17,76
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Two.


857
0:34:17,76 --> 0:34:19,81
Nine Inch Nails, The Cure.


858
0:34:19,81 --> 0:34:21,27
JACI BADZIN: Nice.


859
0:34:21,27 --> 0:34:23,917
Your favorite American food is?


860
0:34:23,917 --> 0:34:25,125
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Lobster roll.


861
0:34:25,125 --> 0:34:26,2
JACI BADZIN: Oh,
that's a good one.


862
0:34:26,2 --> 0:34:27,19
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Oh yeah.


863
0:34:27,19 --> 0:34:27,969
A warm lobster roll?


864
0:34:27,969 --> 0:34:29,26
JACI BADZIN: You like the warm?


865
0:34:29,26 --> 0:34:30,31
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Oh, yeah.


866
0:34:30,31 --> 0:34:31,5
JACI BADZIN: I like them both.


867
0:34:31,5 --> 0:34:33,791
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Slightly
toasted, little bit of butter,


868
0:34:33,791 --> 0:34:38,11
soft bun, sweet, slightly briny
lobster fresh out of the ocean,


869
0:34:38,11 --> 0:34:39,11
little bit of mayo-- oh!


870
0:34:39,11 --> 0:34:40,485
JACI BADZIN: You're
really making


871
0:34:40,485 --> 0:34:41,866
me want a lobster
roll right now.


872
0:34:41,866 --> 0:34:42,852
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I'm
leaving, I'm leaving.


873
0:34:42,852 --> 0:34:43,84
That's it.


874
0:34:43,84 --> 0:34:45,3
JACI BADZIN: Let's book
over to Chelsea Market.


875
0:34:45,3 --> 0:34:45,39
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I'm going
to go to that lobster


876
0:34:45,39 --> 0:34:46,52
place in Chelsea Market.


877
0:34:46,52 --> 0:34:48,84
JACI BADZIN: Exactly.


878
0:34:48,84 --> 0:34:51,83
Your favorite DJ is?


879
0:34:51,83 --> 0:34:54,115
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Carl Cox,
DJ Hype, two of them.


880
0:34:54,115 --> 0:34:54,54
JACI BADZIN: Yes, so good.


881
0:34:54,54 --> 0:34:57,13
PAUL LIEBRANDT: That's like
very old school British DJs.


882
0:34:57,13 --> 0:34:58,15
JACI BADZIN: So good.


883
0:34:58,15 --> 0:34:59,44
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Very good.


884
0:34:59,44 --> 0:35:2,33
JACI BADZIN: Your favorite
type of cuisine to eat?


885
0:35:2,33 --> 0:35:3,58
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Japanese food.


886
0:35:3,58 --> 0:35:6,24



887
0:35:6,24 --> 0:35:8,26
JACI BADZIN: What is
your favorite restaurant


888
0:35:8,26 --> 0:35:10,4
that people should know about?


889
0:35:10,4 --> 0:35:11,92
PAUL LIEBRANDT: That
people should know about.


890
0:35:11,92 --> 0:35:13,662
JACI BADZIN: That you're
willing to let people in on.


891
0:35:13,662 --> 0:35:14,495
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Hmm.


892
0:35:14,495 --> 0:35:17,1



893
0:35:17,1 --> 0:35:18,41
Anywhere globally or just--?


894
0:35:18,41 --> 0:35:19,31
JACI BADZIN: Sure.


895
0:35:19,31 --> 0:35:19,57
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Globally.


896
0:35:19,57 --> 0:35:20,2
JACI BADZIN: Globally.


897
0:35:20,2 --> 0:35:22,59
If it's going to be on
YouTube, let's let people know.


898
0:35:22,59 --> 0:35:23,94
PAUL LIEBRANDT: I see.


899
0:35:23,94 --> 0:35:29,48
OK, well, I think
personally, because it


900
0:35:29,48 --> 0:35:33,44
has such a big impact with
me, Pierre Gagnaire in Paris.


901
0:35:33,44 --> 0:35:33,96
JACI BADZIN: Gagnaire.


902
0:35:33,96 --> 0:35:36,72
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Pierre--
thank you-- Pierre Gagnaire


903
0:35:36,72 --> 0:35:41,94
because that man redefined the
way I think about what I do.


904
0:35:41,94 --> 0:35:44,6
So I would say for me
that's closest to my heart.


905
0:35:44,6 --> 0:35:45,779
Magic, real magic.


906
0:35:45,779 --> 0:35:47,32
JACI BADZIN: Is
there a specific dish


907
0:35:47,32 --> 0:35:48,15
that people should get there?


908
0:35:48,15 --> 0:35:49,286
PAUL LIEBRANDT: No, it
changes all the time.


909
0:35:49,286 --> 0:35:50,57
JACI BADZIN: OK.


910
0:35:50,57 --> 0:35:53,44
I'm adding that to my list
of places to eat when I got.


911
0:35:53,44 --> 0:35:55,67
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Please.


912
0:35:55,67 --> 0:35:59,4
JACI BADZIN: And the last
question is let's say,


913
0:35:59,4 --> 0:36:1,616
you've just finished
a grueling day.


914
0:36:1,616 --> 0:36:3,43
You're tired, you're exhausted.


915
0:36:3,43 --> 0:36:5,17
What do you eat at
the end of the shift?


916
0:36:5,17 --> 0:36:7,27
And what do you drink
more importantly?


917
0:36:7,27 --> 0:36:9,41
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Drink water.


918
0:36:9,41 --> 0:36:10,32
JACI BADZIN: Water?


919
0:36:10,32 --> 0:36:11,76
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Water.


920
0:36:11,76 --> 0:36:18,21
And I would say to
eat, I like sushi.


921
0:36:18,21 --> 0:36:21,9
Yeah, sashimi and sushi at
1 o'clock in the morning


922
0:36:21,9 --> 0:36:23,52
is the perfect time.


923
0:36:23,52 --> 0:36:24,94
It really is.


924
0:36:24,94 --> 0:36:27,3
JACI BADZIN: That's
good to know.


925
0:36:27,3 --> 0:36:28,3
Well, thank you so much.


926
0:36:28,3 --> 0:36:31,36
If anybody has any questions,
we're going to open it.


927
0:36:31,36 --> 0:36:32,489
I think you're up.


928
0:36:32,489 --> 0:36:33,3
AUDIENCE: Hi.


929
0:36:33,3 --> 0:36:35,31
First I want to say thank you.


930
0:36:35,31 --> 0:36:39,3
The Elm was somewhere in my top
four favor meals of last year.


931
0:36:39,3 --> 0:36:40,987
It's really difficult
to actually order those,


932
0:36:40,987 --> 0:36:43,57
but it was absolutely wonderful,
and I hope to come back soon.


933
0:36:43,57 --> 0:36:45,43
PAUL LIEBRANDT:
Thank you very much.


934
0:36:45,43 --> 0:36:46,82
AUDIENCE: And normally,
every chef that comes here,


935
0:36:46,82 --> 0:36:47,95
I ask them whether
or not they consider


936
0:36:47,95 --> 0:36:49,592
themselves a craftsman
or an artist?


937
0:36:49,592 --> 0:36:50,8
But you've already took that.


938
0:36:50,8 --> 0:36:54,1
So my back-up question is what
is your favorite ingredient


939
0:36:54,1 --> 0:36:55,89
that you don't get
to use often, either


940
0:36:55,89 --> 0:36:58,17
whether it's because the
general public dislikes it,


941
0:36:58,17 --> 0:36:59,685
it's scarce, it's too expensive?


942
0:36:59,685 --> 0:37:4,98



943
0:37:4,98 --> 0:37:7,26
PAUL LIEBRANDT: Personally
speaking, I think,


944
0:37:7,26 --> 0:37:10,91
shellfish and fish for me
are my favorite ingredients


945
0:37:10,91 --> 0:37:11,58
to work with.


946
0:37:11,58 --> 0:37:20,54
And of that, I would say there's
a species of lobster called


947
0:37:20,54 --> 0:37:24,94
a cigar de mer, which is not a
very widely used lobster, which


948
0:37:24,94 --> 0:37:26,84
you get from the Mediterranean.


949
0:37:26,84 --> 0:37:29,36
And it's a known as
a slipper lobster.


950
0:37:29,36 --> 0:37:32,7
It's very expensive,
very seasonal.


951
0:37:32,7 --> 0:37:35,23
I only ever used it in
France at Pierre Gagnaire.


952
0:37:35,23 --> 0:37:38,3
And it's a very rare
item, but the flavor


953
