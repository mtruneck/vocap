CHRIS HARRIS: So I bought
an Audi S4.


6
0:0:21,78 --> 0:0:25,19
And I've done so for
several reasons.


7
0:0:25,19 --> 0:0:27,55
First up, it used to belong
to a family member.


8
0:0:27,55 --> 0:0:30,37
So it is in a disgusting
state of repair.

me an S4 in worse condition

15
0:0:40,25 --> 0:0:41,6
Its bodywork is ruined.

Pretty much every panel's got
a dent or a scratch in it.

Inside, it's been lived
in by two big, hairy,


18
0:0:46,97 --> 0:0:48,62
smelly, mostly wet dogs.


19
0:0:48,62 --> 0:0:49,61
And it stinks.


20
0:0:49,61 --> 0:0:50,26
You know what?


21
0:0:50,26 --> 0:0:52,82
We need a better camera car
this year because the old


22
0:0:52,82 --> 0:0:55,45
Passat was just too slow,
too much of the time.


23
0:0:55,45 --> 0:0:56,9
The car wasn't too expensive.


24
0:0:56,9 --> 0:0:58,64
That's two reasons.


25
0:0:58,64 --> 0:1:1,59
Third reason, the S4, as you now
know, is a car I've always


26
0:1:1,59 --> 0:1:2,71
really admired.


27
0:1:2,71 --> 0:1:5,36
And I quite fancy one because
it's low-key, and yet it's


28
0:1:5,36 --> 0:1:7,28
very fast and compact.


29
0:1:7,28 --> 0:1:9,97
Fourth reason, people keep
telling me that you can


30
0:1:9,97 --> 0:1:13,93
extract more power from these
things quite easily.


31
0:1:13,93 --> 0:1:16,64
I haven't tuned a car since
I was quite a bit younger.


32
0:1:16,64 --> 0:1:18,44
And I quite like the idea
of having something


33
0:1:18,44 --> 0:1:19,64
that's a bit stealthy.


34
0:1:19,64 --> 0:1:22,92
So I went to a place called
REVO Technik.


35
0:1:22,92 --> 0:1:26,31
And they said to me, that they'd
had better results with


36
0:1:26,31 --> 0:1:29,34
changing the software on the
Audi S4 V8 model than


37
0:1:29,34 --> 0:1:32,44
virtually any other car they'd
ever played with.


38
0:1:32,44 --> 0:1:34,86
So I thought, let's go along
there, have them play with the


39
0:1:34,86 --> 0:1:38,13
software, maybe stick some
brakes on it, and see what we


40
0:1:38,13 --> 0:1:39,27
end up with.


41
0:1:39,27 --> 0:1:43,16
Now, what car do you match
against an S4 to find out if


42
0:1:43,16 --> 0:1:46,2
it really is performing
to a higher level?


43
0:1:46,2 --> 0:1:48,61
What's a higher level of S4?


44
0:1:48,61 --> 0:1:50,9
It's an RS4.


45
0:1:50,9 --> 0:1:56,2
So I thought, we'd go and find
out how a REVO software-mapped


46
0:1:56,2 --> 0:1:59,18

an Audi RS4.

in 4.7 seconds, and 100 in


201
0:9:22,81 --> 0:9:24,59
11.3 seconds.


202
0:9:24,59 --> 0:9:28,75
Still impressive, but miles off
the REVO-adjusted version.


203
0:9:28,75 --> 0:9:30,56
How much power does it have?


204
0:9:30,56 --> 0:9:33,5
I don't really care, actually,
so long as it does the numbers


205
0:9:33,5 --> 0:9:33,73
on the flat.


206
0:9:33,73 --> 0:9:37,21
But it must have well over
400 horsepower now.


207
0:9:37,21 --> 0:9:41,16
With so much extra poke, we're
trying some Stasis 370 mil


208
0:9:41,16 --> 0:9:43,13
front brakes with 6-piston
calipers.


209
0:9:43,13 --> 0:9:45,49
They fit behind the standard
rims, and are miles better


210
0:9:45,49 --> 0:9:47,605
than the stock at full brakes.


211
0:9:47,605 --> 0:9:50,33
The only other mods are thicker
rear anti-roll bar and


212
0:9:50,33 --> 0:9:53,36
an optional exhaust, which
sounds a little fruitier and


213
0:9:53,36 --> 0:9:55,98
ditches the slightly pathetic
S4 tailpipes.


214
0:9:55,98 --> 0:9:57,71
It's a bit shiny right now.


215
0:9:57,71 --> 0:10:1,75
But the strict "no washing"
regime will soon fix that.


216
0:10:1,75 --> 0:10:5,11
Here's a breakdown
of the costs.


217
0:10:5,11 --> 0:10:7,44
Now, I need to be absolutely
clear.


218
0:10:7,44 --> 0:10:11,3
This exercise is about showing
just what you can squeeze from


219
0:10:11,3 --> 0:10:12,71
an S4 with very little work.


220
0:10:12,71 --> 0:10:15,46
It's not about belittling
the RS4.


221
0:10:15,46 --> 0:10:18,49
Of course, in comparing it
to the RS4, I'm naturally


222
0:10:18,49 --> 0:10:21,82
slightly exposing some of its
performance, let's say,


223
0:10:21,82 --> 0:10:24,12
"deficit" compared
to the car that's


224
0:10:24,12 --> 0:10:25,13
lower down in the range.


225
0:10:25,13 --> 0:10:28,85
But I'm not trying to take the
mickey out of the RS4, for the


226
0:10:28,85 --> 0:10:30,975
simple reason that the
RS4 is a lovely car.


227
0:10:30,975 --> 0:10:34,26
But by heck, is it
a confusing car!


228
0:10:34,26 --> 0:10:36,77
Neil and I have spent several
days in this thing now.


229
0:10:36,77 --> 0:10:39,66
And it really is like the
sort of beautiful,


230
0:10:39,66 --> 0:10:43,85
boyfriend-girlfriend situation
that isn't actually all the


231
0:10:43,85 --> 0:10:46,22
personality you might
want it to be.


232
0:10:46,22 --> 0:10:48,4
On the road, the steering
can be really


233
0:10:48,4 --> 0:10:49,64
odd, the dynamic steering.


234
0:10:49,64 --> 0:10:52,94
The chassis, when it's in
Comfort mode, it's a bit loose


235
0:10:52,94 --> 0:10:54,9
and doesn't ride that well.


236
0:10:54,9 --> 0:10:55,99
When you put it in Dynamic mode,
I don't know what they


237
0:10:55,99 --> 0:10:56,62
were thinking.


238
0:10:56,62 --> 0:10:58,4
I mean, you just simply
can't drive it.


239
0:10:58,4 --> 0:10:59,54
It's so firm.


240
0:10:59,54 --> 0:11:2,66
The engine's so exciting and
wants to rev, and yet it


241
0:11:2,66 --> 0:11:6,74
doesn't have anything like
as much torque as the S4.


242
0:11:6,74 --> 0:11:9,6
And you have to really be
up it the whole time.


243
0:11:9,6 --> 0:11:12,91
But this is the big problem with
the RS4, every time you


244
0:11:12,91 --> 0:11:16,6
see it, you completely fall in
love with it because it's so


245
0:11:16,6 --> 0:11:17,9
good looking.


246
0:11:17,9 --> 0:11:19,5
And as an object, it's
just gorgeous.


247
0:11:19,5 --> 0:11:21,92
The interior is beautiful.


248
0:11:21,92 --> 0:11:25,3
It's a car that I'd love to have
outside my door all year


249
0:11:25,3 --> 0:11:28,975
long, but probably for all
the wrong reasons.


250
0:11:28,975 --> 0:11:31,82
And of course, anyone looking
to spend between 60,000 and


251
0:11:31,82 --> 0:11:35,36
70,000 pounds on a new small
estate car isn't looking to go


252
0:11:35,36 --> 0:11:38,1
and buy a used S4 and chip
it up and do the


253
0:11:38,1 --> 0:11:39,44
things that I've done.


254
0:11:39,44 --> 0:11:41,72
So there isn't really a
comparison there at all.


255
0:11:41,72 --> 0:11:45,315
The RS4 really is a
flawed diamond.


256
0:11:45,315 --> 0:11:47,91
But it proves that these
Audi RS products are


257
0:11:47,91 --> 0:11:49,28
very hit and miss.


258
0:11:49,28 --> 0:11:51,69
We're going to drive
an R8 B10 soon, and


259
0:11:51,69 --> 0:11:53,52
that's a bit of kick.


260
0:11:53,52 --> 0:11:57,98
The RS4, I think, is in many
ways quite the compromised


261
0:11:57,98 --> 0:12:2,5
driving machine, but
a beautiful object.
