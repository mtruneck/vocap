###0 Emwi not only eats monkeys, she loves them.
###31 Almost all Awa families keep a number of monkey pets.
###35 There are eight different species in the village.
###41 The Awa show extraordinary tenderness for the little monkeys,
###45 believing they're more human than animal.
###52 Emwi is a devoted mother, both to her children and her monkeys.
###67 For Emwi and the other Awa,
###76 breastfeeding monkeys is simply a natural way to help an orphan in need.
###91 Caring so intimately for an animal they regularly kill
###95 may appear contradictory,
###97 but the Awa believe for everything they take from the forest,
###101 they have to give back.
###113 When our lives are so deeply entwined with animals and plants,
###118 they inevitably become a great source of inspiration.
###121 Perhaps the most spectacular case of culture imitating nature
###127 is found amongst the people of Papua New Guinea.
###144 Deep in the forest,
###145 a male superb bird of paradise struts his stuff for a rather drab female
###152 but she isn't the only one watching.
###158 Geling is a bird of paradise hunter
###166 and it's the highly prized feathers he's after.
###199 These coveted plumes are passed down through generations
###203 but occasionally damaged ones need replacing.
###209 Birds of paradise are so hard to hunt, however, that Geling's enlisted help.
###216 Peke is after the long tail feathers of the Princess Astrapia,
###223 and he's using fruit to lure them in
###254 Tomorrow is a big day for Geling.
###257 His clan will be performing at a Sing Sing,
###260 where his reputation and the honour of his village
###263 will be judged on the quality of his feather collection.
###274 Sing Sing events are all about competing
###276 to see who's the best-dressed,
###279 and Geling knows not a plume can be out of place.
###295 In both birds and humans,
###297 it's the most eye-catching who gets the most attention,
###301 though Geling might be overstating his conquests.
###312 (CHANTING)
###320 The Mount Hagen Sing Sing
###335 is the world's largest jungle-themed fancy-dress party.
###343 Attended by hundreds of tribes,
###345 it's one of New Guinea's biggest national events.
###350 Amidst the mayhem, Geling's putting the finishing touches to his outfit.
###361 In New Guinea, male vanity is something to flaunt.
###375 Though each clan has its own style...
###381 ...almost all wear bird of paradise feathers as their crowning glory.
###388 In their looks, and even their courtship dances,
###397 the parallels between man and animal are unmistakable.
###406 They're birds of a feather.
###410 Both use these precious plumes to display fitness and beauty.
###418 Taking centre stage, it's Geling's turn to show off.
###434 This deep connection with birds of paradise began 40,000 years ago...
###440 ...and it shows few signs of fading.
###448 Geling's getting on a bit,
###449 and his female admirers aren't quite as plentiful as they used to be...
###455 ...but he's not going to let that ruffle his feathers.
###461 The diverse nature of the rainforest influences the people who live here
###469 in endless ways
###470 and it often leads to breathtaking results.
###478 For the Bayaka tribe of Africa's Congo basin,
###482 it's the sounds of the jungle that most inspire them.
###494 (RHYTHMIC BEAT)
###514 Whether using a river as a drum kit...
###519 ...or incorporating animal calls into their work songs...
###523 ...the Bayaka consider music to be their greatest gift from the forest.
###536 (SINGING)
###541 But there's something else found here that the Bayaka prize just as highly.
###551 So highly they're prepared to risk their lives for it.
###557 Tete and Mongonje are on the hunt,
###562 but it's not meat they're after.
###585 Honey is liquid gold to the Bayaka,
###588 and they go to extraordinary lengths to gather it.
###593 Using a special vine,
###595 Tete makes a harness to help him get to grips with this 40-metre tree.
###608 Climbing like this requires skill, strength and stamina,
###613 especially in the tropical heat.
###616 While Tete climbs, Mongonje prepares a bundle of smoking leaves
###622 to help pacify the bees.
###633 An hour's passed and Tete's making impressive progress.
###648 But he's still got a way to go.
###668 News that honey's been found has spread quickly,
###673 and Tete's wife and kids come
###688 to watch.
###689 Tete's finally made it to the crown of the tree
###692 but to go any further he'll have to leave the security of his vine.
###708 Tete's fully aware how dangerous honey gathering is,
###723 but the Bayaka believe it's bravery that makes the man,
###729 and sugar is so scarce in these forests
###732 that honey is the best nutrition Tete can provide for his family.
###739 40 metres up, and unattached, Tete can't put a foot wrong.
###774 And now the bees are beginning to attack.
###788 He's made it to the hive,
###790 but he's got to get at the honey before being overcome by bees.
###795 The smoke helps, but Tete's still being stung.
###817 Finally Tete strikes gold.
###821 The first basket goes down to Tete's family...
###833 ...and even thousands of angry bees can't stop
###862 the feast.
###866 Tete takes time to savour his success.
###872 He's done enough to keep his wife sweet, treat his children
###877 and earn respect from his tribe.
###896 For forest people, simple things can hold extraordinary value,
