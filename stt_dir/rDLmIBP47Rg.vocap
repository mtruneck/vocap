###4 - Hey mom. - Hey Lindsey.
###7 Mom, do you know any stories of any interesting relatives in your family?
###11 - Uh, let's see...
###13 Oh, there was cousin Isaac.
###15 We called him Izzy.
###16 - Oh, really? What's his story?
###17 - That was it.
###19 His name was Isaac, and we called him Izzy.
###20 - He did do something important once,
###22 but nobody would tell me what it was,
###24 and he went to jail.
###25 - Hey, you know,
###27 I know this story about a boy
###28 who had a sister who was half girl, half dog.
###30 - And I know a story about a girl
###32 who punched her brother in the face
###33 and gave him two swollen eyes.
###34 - Okay, enough.
###36 What is this for anyway?
###37 - I have to write about
###39 an interesting relative for my English class.
###40 - Oh. Well, your father has a bunch
###42 of old family photo albums.
###43 Maybe you can find somebody interesting
###45 on his side of the family.
###46 - Wow. That's a really good idea.
###47 Thanks.
###48 - Hey, you know, if that doesn't work,
###50 I know another story about this kid...
###51 - Say another word, and I will spit in your ear.
###54 By the time mom gets over here, it'll be too late.
###57 Thanks, mom.
###59 - Oh, you're welcome.

###72 - Hey, thanks for coming over and doing my blog for me, Ray.
###74 - Hey, man, I just want to get as much attention
###76 for my charity as I possibly can.
###78 We got this real big event coming up:
###81 music, comedy, a celebrity basketball game,
###84 a fashion show, and a pancake breakfast.
###87 - Throw in Tom joyner,
###88 and you could put all that on a cruise.
###92 - Yes, it's for the kids.
###95 But I'm telling you, I'm having the hardest time
###97 pulling it all together, man. Seriously.
###99 - You know what, you should talk to my wife.
###102 She plans stuff like this all the time.
###104 - Hello. - And there she is.
###106 - Here I am.
###107 - Suzanne, this is star first baseman Ray savage.
###109 Ray, this my wife, Suzanne.
###111 - Hi. - Oh, it's nice to meet you.
###113 All right, now, is that Suzanne with a "z" or an "s"?
###116 - Ah, a "z."
###118 - Mmm. I like the "z"s.
###120 You're a lucky man, Nick. Lucky man.
###123 - You know, I know you.
###124 I've seen you in those commercials with the kids.
###127 Yeah, that's kind of my thing.
###128 You know, George Clooney is for helping out Africa.
###130 Sting is for saving the rain forests.
###132 And Sean penn, you know, he's for helping out them Haitians.
###135 Me? I'm for the kids.
###139 - Hey, babe, are we still going to the movie on Wednesday night?
###141 - Oh, yeah. We're good.
###142 - Okay, 'cause I was just looking at the review.
###144 Four stars.
###146 - I can't wait. - All right, bye.
###147 - Oh, whoa. Wait, wait.
###148 Ray is putting together this huge charity event,
###151 and, uh, it sounds like he could use your help.
###153 - Oh, okay.
###154 Well, I will get your information from Nick,
###156 and I'll have my assistant, Gigi, give you call
###158 and schedule something and discuss consultation fees.
###160 - Fees?
###162 - Yeah.
###163 I do it for money, not for the kids.
###166 - Ha.
###169 - Oh, and this is my mother with granny "V"
###172 at a negro league baseball game.
###174 One of her boyfriends played for the San Francisco sea lions.
###177 - What's that in her hand?
###179 - Oh, that's an early version of the number one finger.
###181 It was made entirely of wood.
###183 - Wood?
###184 - Yeah, styrofoam was too expensive back then.
###186 You know, a lot of people say
###188 granny "V" was ahead of her time.
###189 - Why do they say that?
###190 - Have you ever heard of madam C.J. Walker?
###193 - No. Who's she?
###195 - Well, she was the first woman millionaire.
###197 - Wow, she was like the first Oprah.
###200 - Yeah. - Was granny "V" her partner?
###201 - Oh, no, no.
###203 Granny "V" was the first woman to borrow $20,000 from her.
###206 She was more like the first Gayle.
###209 - Anyway, she had this great idea for a shop
###211 where people could get eyeglasses in an hr.
###213 Now, at the time, nobody thought it would work.
###215 - Did it? - No.
###217 She lost every dime.
###218 And madam C.J. Walker never spoke to her again.
###221 Wow.
###222 - Yeah, she was pretty special.
###225 - Wow, this is the weirdest-looking leg
###226 I have ever seen.
###227 - Yeah, that's Nick's great Uncle Blackie.
###230 And he wasn't white. He was an albino.
###233 - Then why'd they call him Blackie?
###235 - Because if they didn't,
###236 everybody would have thought he was white.
###238 - Oh, it's kind of like the first the rock.
###240 Special.
###250 - Hey, man. Here's your package.
###253 Man, you got your feet up on my...
###255 What the hell?
###256 Martin.
###258 Martin!
###259 Are you okay?
###260 - He can't hear you.
###261 What you lookin' at here...
###264 Is the latest in advanced field-interrogation <i>apparati.</i>
###268 - It's not just a box on his head?
###269 - No, it's not.
###270 It's the all-new,
###272 portable sensory-deprivation chamber.
###279 Oh, God. Free at last.
###281 They use that thing on people?
###283 - Not if you tell us what we need to know.
###287 - Hey, man.
###289 Thanks for signing for my package.
###291 - Why are you having all this stuff
###292 sent to my house anyway?
###293 - You think I'm crazy enough to let people know my address?
###297 - Or is it that the post office doesn't deliver
###299 to a windowless black van?
###302 - How you know it's black?
###305 - Okay, so what's in that one?
###306 - Oh, that's just some socks.
###308 Argyle.
###310 What's that?
###311 - What? What could it be? - What is what?
###314 - So lame.
###317 So...
###318 Suzanne is meeting up with Ray savage, huh?
###321 - Yeah. Why?
###323 - Let's just say my man has a bit of a...reputation,
###326 and that Sandra Bullock would do well to stay away from it.
###328 - Yeah, well, Suzanne's just doing business with him.
###331 - Okay. I'm just saying, keep your eye on that guy.
###339 - Good morning.
###341 - Hey, baby.
###342 I saved you some breakfast.
###343 The kids left for school already.
###345 - Thank you.
###346 I didn't realize it was so late.
###348 - Hmm. What time you'd get in last night?
###351 - I don't know. Around midnight.
###352 - Oh, that was a long meeting.
###357 Well, I guess you guys got everything
###359 pretty much figured out.
###361 - Nick, I know you don't want to admit this,
###364 but you should just say it, "I am jealous."
###367 - I am not jealous.
###369 - If it makes you feel any better,
###371 Ray was the perfect gentleman.
###372 All he did all night was talk about the kids.
###375 - At a hotel lounge at 1:00 in the morning.
###377 - I was not there at 1:00 in the morning.
###380 - Well, you weren't here.
###383 - Yes, I was.
###384 - So you do know what time you came in?
###387 - Yes, after you were asleep and before 1:00 A.M.
###391 I can't believe you.
###392 - Oh, you can't believe me?
###394 What if I was the one coming in at who knows what time?
###397 - After 12:00 and before 1:00.
###399 - In a hotel lobby with some strange woman?
###401 - That I introduced you to.
###402 - Well, what difference does it make how I met her?
###404 - I wouldn't introduce you to somebody
###406 that I was worried about you being around?
###408 - Well, what if you didn't get worried
###409 until after I was around her?
###410 - And why would I be worried?
###412 - Because I came home after 12:00 and before 1:00
###414 when I said I'd be back by 10:00.
###418 And, yeah, I'm jealous.
###424 - Okay, so at 6:00 P.M.,
###426 we'll have the celebrity basketball game.
###428 And that should give us enough time
###429 to open the doors at 9:30 for the comedy show.
###432 - Ooh, ooh, ooh.
###433 You think we can get Wanda Sykes?
###434 - You think we can bet a big, fat check?
###436 - Bob Saget'll work.
###438 - Suzanne, can you come over here
###440 and take a look at this web page?
###442 - Just send me a link.
###443 - You know, I don't know how to do that.
###445 - I'll help you with that, baby.
###446 - No, thank you.
###447 Suzanne, I really need you to come look at it.
###449 - Flowers for Mrs. Kingston-persons.
###452 - Oh, thank you.
###455 So...
###456 What's this?
###458 - Ah, my check. - Oh.
###461 Thank you. But it's missing a zero.
###463 - Uh, you know what, I think you might have to earn that.
###466 - If I work too hard,
###467 you're not gonna be able to afford me.
###469 - Mmm.
###471 - So, Gigi, what'd you want to...
###473 Did you see where Gigi went?
###475 - I wasn't watching her.
###476 I was watching you.
###480 - Okay. Sure.
###483 So when will you need me to pick that up?
###484 - Hello?
###486 - So can you explain to me exactly what it is
###488 you're trying to do.
###489 - Oh, I'm sorry.
###491 I have no idea what you're talking about.
###492 - No, uh, uh, I'm sorry.
###494 It's just... it's a little too close for comfort.
###496 - Yeah.
###497 Well, I understand your concern.
###500 But I don't think that's gonna be an issue.
###502 - Yeah, well, I just want you to know,
###504 I've done a full background check,
###505 and it turns out not only is the client
###507 married to another firm,
###508 but he's doing business with several small companies
###511 around town.
###512 Yes.
###513 Yeah, I just don't think this is a relationship
###515 we want to continue.
###516 - Well, I've got everything under control,
###518 and I'm gonna wrap this up in a couple of days,
###520 and I'll talk to you then.
###522 Okay? All right.
###523 Thanks so much for calling.
###524 Buh-bye.
###526 - Yeah, okay.
###527 Okay. Yeah.
###528 Mm-Hmm.
###530 Yeah, I just want you to know
###531 that I'm not happy with the situation.
###533 Right.
###534 Yeah, and I can't promise to keep my mouth closed.
###536 Right. Okay.
###538 All right.
###540 Bye-bye.
###543 - Gigi, what'd you want to show me?
###544 - I sent you the link.
###546 - Ladies,
###547 as much as I've enjoyed the pleasure of your company,
###549 I have a stadium to fill and bases to steal.
###552 - Oh, that's too bad.
###553 Let me get your jacket.
###554 - I didn't bring one. - Take one anyway.
###557 - Uh, I'll text you later. - Bye.
###559 Bye!
###560 - Yeah. - B-y-e.
###562 Bye.
###568 - And then in 1956, granny "V" lost her house
###572 and moved into a retirement home
###573 after spending her entire savings
###575 in an attempt to market water sold inside of bottles.
###578 What do you think so far?
###579 - Boring.
###580 What you should do is write that report
###582 on somebody who's ten times more interesting,
###585 more dynamic, mystious, and handsome.
###589 - Like who? - Like me.
###591 - Well, I guess it's not too late.
###593 Do you mind if I ask you some questions to start?
###595 - Shoot. - When were you born?
###597 - I was born on the 127th day in the Chinese year
###601 of the Yang metal dog.
###603 - Can you give me a number?
###604 - 4667.
###606 Dang, are you they teaching y'all anything in school?
###609 - What's your middle name?
###611 - I don't want to tell you.
###612 - Is that top-secret too?
###614 - No. I just don't like it.
###616 - Is there anything you <i>can</i> tell me.
###618 - Lindsey, I told you enough, all right?
###622 I told you I have a middle name.
###623 I told you my birthday.
###624 You know I'm your uncle.
###626 You still can't write it?
###628 - Look, I once had to do a report, 300 pages,
###631 off of a severed ear I found in the sand,
###633 using the severed ear.
###636 Tell me, could granny "V" do that?
###637 - Mm-mm. - Uh-uh.
###639 Now, when you finish your report on me,
###641 I need to look at that because I might
###642 have to redact a few things, you know what I mean?
###644 I done told you enough.
###645 Tell your father thanks for the package.
###647 - What is in that anyway?
###648 - Oh, this is a sonic annihilator.
###651 - What's a sonic annihilator do?
###653 - It delivers an incapacitating, seemingly silent shot of sound
###657 to any hostile target.
###659 - Mm.
###660 - It's the latest in nonlethal close combat.
###662 Watch this. Kevin!
###668 - Oh, my God.
###669 Is he gonna be okay?
###670 - Uh, yeah, you know what,
###672 just... just wrap him up in a snuggie
###674 and don't tell your mom I was here.
###675 Uh...What's that?
###687 - Ugh!
###690 - Yeah, I forgot my keys.
###693 What's that?
###699 - Two pizzas, 20 minutes. Cool.
###703 Ooh-whee.
###706 Look at you. You look amazing.
###708 - Thank you, honey.
###710 You look nice too. Where are you going?
###712 - I'm going out with you.
###714 Dinner, movies.
###716 Four stars, remember?
###717 - Oh, Nick. I'm so sorry.
###720 I forgot. Can we reschedule?
###722 - You forgot we were going out?
###724 - I forgot.
###725 - Then, why are you dressed like that?
###727 - I told Ray I would meet him and his partners again tonight
###729 so we could finalize everything.
###731 - Dressed like that?
###732 Where's the meeting... Vegas?
###740 - Nick.
###742 It's at a restaurant.
###744 - Does your dress know that?
###745 - Nick, stop it.
###746 - I don't have to stop it.
###748 Look, when you didn't like women I was working with,
###750 you were ready to upside people's heads
###752 and put bullets in their behinds.
###754 - That was different. - How?
###756 - Okay, that wasn't different.
###758 But, Nick, if you just give me a chance
###760 to finalize everything tonight,
###761 after that, I promise, I am all yours.
###764 - Okay. You go ahead.
###767 But while you at dinner,
###768 I want you to think of something.
###770 - What's that?
###771 - Me, here, hungry,
###775 alone, and sad,
###778 watching a one-star movie.
###780 - Okay, now, that's low.
###781 - Not lower than me.
###783 - Oh, my God.
###785 - Have fun.
###795 - I'll take another one, please, and one for her too.
###797 - Uh, no, actually.
###798 Thank you. I'm fine.
###800 - Yes, you are.
###802 - Thanks.
###803 - Come on. Loosen up.
###804 Let's have some fun.
###806 - You know, Ray, I like having fun as much the next person,
###809 but I'm actually here to discuss business.
###811 - Okay, ivanka trump.
###813 Let's discuss business, all right?
###816 - Okay, thank you. - Business.
###818 - So I was thinking we could get all the local food restaurants
###821 to sponsor food tents, and that way, they could...
###823 W-what... what are you doing?
###825 - I couldn't see your face when you were talking.
###828 - You want to go somewhere where there's more light?
###831 - I was thinking someplace with less light.
###833 - Can we bring your wife?
###835 - She's with the kids.
###837 Hey, my boy's got a table at the club.
###840 Let's roll over there, and we can talk on the way.
###842 - Ray, I'm not going to a club with you.
###844 - Come on, Suzanne Kingston-persons.
###846 Look, if we're gonna discuss business,
###848 we gotta hit this club, and we got to hit it right.
###850 Let's ride.
###852 I see ride in your eyes.
###853 Are you rolling or not? Come on.
###854 - I'll take "or not" for $20.
###860 - Girl, quit playing.
###861 Ser...
###862 Hey, I'll text you the address.
###864 No, serious... I'll see you there.
###877 - Hey, babe.
###878 - Hey.
###880 What are you doing here so early?
###882 I didn't expect to see you till the morning.
###884 - Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
###886 I was wrong.
###887 - Well, I hope you got all your work done.
###889 I hate to think I was sitting here sad and lonely for nothing.
###893 - Okay, Nick, stop it.
###897 Nick, Ray hit on me.
###901 - Really?
###902 You mean to tell me you met a guy in a dark place
###905 late at night in a sexy dress and he hit on you?
###907 Really?
###909 I'm shocked.
###910 In other news, ice cream is cold.
###912 - You're not mad, are you?
###915 - A little bit.
###917 How am I supposed to feel?
###918 - Disappointed but proud of me
###920 that as soon as I realized what was happening,
###922 I got out there and came home.
###924 - Nah, I'm gonna stick with mad.
###926 So what now?
###929 - Well, tomorrow I'll have Ray come to the office.
###931 I'll return his deposit,
###932 and I'll tell him I can't take the job.
###934 - Good.
###936 'Cause you have a lot of work to do at home.
###938 - When do I start?
###940 - Right after the game goes off.
###942 - After the game?
###945 - Yeah, unless you want me to be sad.
###953 Good morning, everybody. - Hey, dad.
###956 - Knock knock.
###958 - Hey, Terrence.
###959 - Hey, Dick.
###960 Where's baby sis?
###962 - Here I am.
###963 - Look, we need to talk.
###964 - Okay. - About what?
###966 - First of all, I think you need to get these kids out of here,
###968 'cause this is grown-folk business.
###969 - Kevin, Lindsey, please go finish getting ready for school.
###973 - Okay.
###975 - Kevin, get moving.
###976 - Good morning.
###977 - Boy, what is wrong with your hearing?
###980 - Hey, Kevin.
###982 You gotta get ready for school now.
###984 - Oh, okay.
###986 I'll catch ya later.
###987 - Oh, calculator? Yes, in the drawer.
###989 - What is wrong with that boy? - I don't know.
###991 - It's them damn Dr. Dre headphones you bought him.
###993 I told ya they was too loud.
###994 - Okay, so what is going on, Terrence?
###998 - You tell me.
###999 What's this I hear about you all up in the club,
###1002 getting close and personal with Ray Savage?
###1005 - You know what, is this any of your business?
###1007 - You my baby sis, right?
###1009 - Yeah. - And you knew about this, man?
###1011 - It's not what you think.
###1012 Suzanne was there for work.
###1014 I guess he had some other ideas.
###1016 - But I came home, and I told my husband, Nick.
###1019 Okay? Are you happy?
###1021 - No. I'm not happy. All right?
###1024 I got a reputation.
###1025 I can't have my little sister's name drug through the streets.
###1028 - Hey, man. Don't worry about that.
###1030 Look, you can't stop people from talking,
###1032 especially when they don't know what they're talking about.
###1034 - I know that's right,
###1036 'cause I don't brought down more than a few people
###1038 with my campaigns of misinformation.
###1040 You heard about mubarak?
###1042 - You did that?
###1044 - Did what?
###1045 - Nothing.
###1048 - I got your package.
###1049 - Oh, yeah. Thanks, man.
###1052 This should be the last one.
###1054 - What in the world?
###1056 - Oh, whoa.
###1058 - What is that?
###1060 - I can't tell you, but it's not socks.
###1064 Man, you're a better man than me, trick.
###1065 Look, man, if my wife was in the club with some dude
###1068 and he was pushing all on her, man, I don't know what I'd do.
###1071 - Let's just hope you wouldn't have done
###1073 whatever you was gonna do with whatever's in that package.
###1075 - Ah, man, this ain't gonna do nothing to you.
###1077 This ain't nothing but a blow-dryer.
###1079 See y'all later.
###1086 - Hey, good morning, ladies.
###1088 - Hi, Ray.
###1089 - We gonna get down to some business?
###1091 You know, we could have took care of this last night.
###1093 - I'm sorry, but we're not going to be able
###1094 to coordinate your event.
###1096 - Oh, well, I thought this was a done deal.
###1097 - Well, it's not.
###1100 - Well, then, what have we been doing
###1101 for the past few days, then?
###1102 - I was about to ask you the same question.
###1104 - Whoa. What's that supposed to mean?
###1107 - Wow.
###1109 You aren't going to actually stand there
###1111 and act like you don't know why you've been inviting my wife
###1114 out to clubs and dinners
###1115 and hotels for the past few days?
###1118 Really, Ray?
###1118 Are you gonna come at me like that?
###1120 - Hey, man.
###1121 I was doing it for the kids.
###1123 - You know what, man, I think you better go,
###1127 'cause what I'm about to do
###1129 ain't got nothing to do with the kids.
###1133 - Oh? - Yeah.
###1134 - Oh-ho.
###1135 Are you threatening me?
###1137 - He just said what he about to do
###1138 ain't got nothing to do with the kids.
###1139 What part of "ain't for the kids"
###1141 don't you understand?
###1142 - It's time for you to go.
###1148 - I've been hit by a pitch before.
###1150 Call me. - Bye.
###1152 - Tweet me. - Bye.
###1154 - Facebook. - Bye.
###1155 - Skype. - Bye.
###1156 - Hey, brother.
###1161 - BBN. - Bye.
###1168 - Even after she moved into a retirement home,
###1169 granny "V" remained as active as ever.
###1172 In 1955, after eating a dinner of barbecued ribs,
###1176 granny "V" complained that there wasn't enough meat on the bones
###1178 and wrote a letter to the butcher.
###1180 Afterwards, she became a local spokesperson
###1182 for their new-and-improved meatier ribs,
###1184 when her slogan, "where's the pork?",
###1186 became the tag-line on their radio and tv ads.
###1189 - Very good. - Nice job.
###1191 - Wow.
###1193 Oh, sweetheart, that was just beautiful.
###1195 Your granny "V" would be so honored.
###1198 - And thanks so much, Marilyn.
###1199 I couldn't have done any of this without your help.
###1202 - Oh, baby, you are so welcome.
###1203 Now, if you'll excuse me,
###1205 there seems to be a hole in the bottom of my glass.
###1209 - Lindsey, that was a very well-written essay.
###1212 - Thanks, dad.
###1213 - I'm proud of you. - Thanks.
###1216 - Wow.
###1218 She did a great job on that paper.
###1219 - I know.
###1220 Too bad none of it was true.
###1222 - What? You lied to Lindsey?
###1225 - Embellished.
###1227 Well, what was I gonna do?
###1228 She needed help with her paper.
###1229 What was I gonna tell her?
###1230 My granny "V" was a big, fat liar?
###1232 Spent her last few years in the crazy house?
###1234 - Ma, you never told me that.
###1236 - I didn't?
###1238 Well, sorry.
###1239 But, in my defense,
###1241 everything I told her was stuff that people told me
###1244 until I got older
###1245 and other people told me it wasn't true,
###1247 which I am now telling you,
###1248 which you can tell her one day.
###1250 Anyway, let me know what grade she gets.
###1253 And if there's trouble at school, don't call me.
