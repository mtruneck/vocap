###4 THOM DEVITA: Malone said you should tattoo with a Singer
###8 sewing machine if you know how to tattoo.
###11 So I tell that to Nick--
###14 you probably don't even remember this--
###15 and Nick said, but they're so heavy.
###19 Do you remember that?
###21 NICK BUBASH: I don't remember anything.
###23 I can remember the little things, but
###24 that's in that article.
###26 She wrote that in that article.
###27 THOM DEVITA: Oh, is that the one?
###29 Oh, it was that girl?
###30 NICK BUBASH: She called you up and interviewed you.
###35 THOM DEVITA: No, she didn't interview me.
###37 NICK BUBASH: On the phone?
###38 THOM DEVITA: No, it was an intervisit.
###40 NICK BUBASH: Did she come up here?
###42 THOM DEVITA: It was an intervisit.
###43 NICK BUBASH: OK, an intervisit.
###45 THOM DEVITA: Because I don't give interviews.
###47 NICK BUBASH: This is not an interview.
###48 
###57 JOHN WYATT: When they meet Thom, they will realize
###60 they've never met anybody like him before.
###63 He's probably the most different person, without
###66 trying to be different, of anybody I've ever met.
###69 ROBERT RYAN: I was a deVita devotee from the beginning.
###73 It just unlocked this whole world that I was already
###76 totally into of the lower-East Side of New York.
###79 There was just this creative energy there that I think
###82 Thom's work definitely emanates.
###85 SCOTT HARRISON: He does what he's inspired
###87 to do at the moment.
###88 He observes and he thinks carefully about what he sees
###91 and he develops his own take on it.
###96 -He wasn't just a tattoo artist, he was
###99 an artist who tattooed.
###103 -You know, it was all one big ball of wax with him.
###106 Everything he did was art--
###108 the way he lived, the way he talked, the way he thought,
###111 what he did, where he went.
###114 The tattoos were just as important as the floor.
###116 
###121 THOM DEVITA: If I said I was an artist, then
###123 I'd be shaming artists.
###125 
###132 [INAUDIBLE].
###134 Want to see 100 of them?
###136 -Sure.
###137 THOM DEVITA: When you see color in my work, that means
###140 it didn't work in black and I had to color it.
###145 ED HARDY: Just his perceptions are so completely unique.
###148 And all these years we've been trying to get the high art
###151 world to recognize him.
###152 And he's just so out there they just didn't know
###155 where to place it.
###156 They didn't know what to do with it.
###158 CLAYTON PATTERSON: deVita's actually extremely important.
###161 Nobody gets it.
###162 But that's the mistake, because if you don't save that
###165 person's history it doesn't exist.
###167 THOM DEVITA: And I stopped going to tattoo
###169 shops after a year.
###172 Every shop I went in, I'd tell them I'm deVita.
###177 And they never heard of deVita.
###179 You walk out like you're an idiot, you know?
###182 Who the hell is deVita?
###183 
###186 -And now they're honored to have you.
###189 THOM DEVITA: No, let me finish.
###191 
###195 You'll have to go in with the camera.
###197 CLAYTON PATTERSON: Yeah, I know.
###199 THOM DEVITA: I like photography.
###201 -You hate filmmakers?
###203 
###206 -Who is the cameraman representing?
###208 THOM DEVITA: I don't know.
###209 He just walked in.
###212 No, he's doing something on me.
###214 -We're doing a documentary about Thom.
###216 
###219 -Who is the video-- the documentary?
###220 -It's for Vice.
###222 -So are you a part of Vice, Thom?
###225 THOM DEVITA: Vice squad?
###226 -Yeah.
###227 THOM DEVITA: No, in New York City the vice squad were the
###230 police who arrested prostitutes and [INAUDIBLE] of
###234 vice.
###235 -Oh, that goes way back.
###236 I see what you're saying.
###237 Not vice.
###238 All right, yeah.
###239
