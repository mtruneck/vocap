###55 Newscaster on webcast Could a strange substance found by a southwest
###57 Arkansas man be part of a government test? That's the question at the heart of a phenomenon
###63 called chemtrails now getting widespread attention.
###65 Fox 31 Newscast online Male Anchor: Well now they say the government
###67 is dumping chemicals on us to control or manipulate the weather..
###72 Female Anchor: And they say the unusual looking jet trails in the sky are actually chemical-laden
###77 chemtrails.
###77 NBC Newscast People say the government is up there in airplanes
###80 spraying all kinds of chemicals to change or manipulate the weather, leaving what you
###84 see there and they call that a chemtrail.
###87 Male Reporter So when I look up there what I think are contrails,
###90 you're telling me are chemtrails.
###91 Female witness Yes. A contrail would be dissipated by now.
###93 News Channel 10 Webcast Dave
###94 That's interesting Dale and Christina, this is of interest not only in this country but
###97 in European countries and indeed all over the world. A lot of folks are interested in
###99 it.
###99 Christina Well, Dave, you mentioned that climatologists
###101 and others who study the atmosphere believe that they would be able to surely spot any
###106 kinds of signs of an ominous plot.
###108 Narrator – Michael J. Murphy Our journey started in San Diego, California
###111 where thousands of scientists, engineers, policy-makers, and journalists gathered for
###115 The American Association for the Advancement of Science Conference. One of the topics was
###119 the artificial manipulation of the Earth's climate, also called geoengineering. During
###123 the meeting, scientists spoke about he plausibility of implementing geoengineering campaigns throughout
###129 the world, under the guise of preventing global warming. One widely accepted theory was to
###134 block the sun by spraying something into the atmosphere. When they were asked about existing
###139 aerosol programs they stated clearly that no such programs had ever been implemented.
###143 But strangely, these proposals sounded exactly like what people around the world are claiming
###148 is already happening.
###149 Stewart Howe – Journalist When I found out that the American Association
###153 for the Advancement of Science was going to be held down here and the main body of topics
###158 would be on geoengineering, I had to come. I had to be in on this. I had to hear what
###164 these top climate change scientists had to say.
###167 AAAS Conference Panelist As to the other question about chemtrails
###172 and whether geoengineering would be deployed right now with or without our knowledge, I
###182 think, it's my personal insight that, other than to say I work in government at pretty
###187 high levels, at the White House and in state government and I am personally skeptical of
###191 that. But honestly, you never know with government.
###194 Newscast online Chemtrails. On the internet they are cited
###196 as proof of the government creating clouds to combat global warming.
###199 Webcast of New Zealand Parliament Speaker
###200 They claim the American government with the secret approval of the national government
###205 is covertly using jet aircraft to spray population centers with aluminum, with barium, and with
###212 strontium so as to reduce people's humility and to reduce the global population.
###217 Online video – speaker unknown Yes, I'm always a little bit suspicious because
###220 the government doesn't seem that capable to do something on such a large scale, you know?
###225 Weather Webcast Channel 10 (location unknown) That is not rain, that is not snow. Believe
###227 it or not military aircraft flying through the region is dropping chaff, small bits of
###233 aluminum, sometimes it's made of plastic or even metalicized [sic] paper products, but
###238 its use is an antiradar issue and obviously they're up there practicing. Now they won't
###242 confirm that but I was in the marine corp for many years, and I'll tell you right now.
###246 That's what it is.
###246 Webcast Channel 10 Weather (location unknown) Now what happens here is military jets come
###248 out of Key West Air Force Base and move off into the atmosphere and drop mylar strips.
###253 Some could be a little wider, some are small glass fibers that are coated in aluminum.
###258 What the Air Force does is they take their military jets and they dump these out of the
###262 aircraft and they fall into the atmosphere, and some take as much as a day to fall down.
###266 Weather Webcast ABC This is inevitably military or something going
###270 on. The government, the Air Force. When you see this kind of pattern like this you can
###274 rest assured there's something going on. They're actually little bitty magnetic, little bitty
###279 strips of whether it's aluminum . . .
###280 Weather Webcast Channel 10 (location unknown) While it's a nuisance to you and I, to determine
###283 what's real and what's not but it looks like it's a lifesaving operation by the military.
###288 Webcast of New Zealand Parliament Presenter
###288 The apparent motive behind this conspiracy theory is one world government.
###292 Speaker Order, order, I cannot hear.
###295 Presenter Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the House, that
###299 both my ministry and my colleague, the Minister of Health who have received correspondence
###303 on this issue, that this conspiracy theory does not have an iota of truth and that the
###310 trails observed from aircraft simply come from jet engines. [laughing]
###315 Speaker Number Nine, order.
###318 Presenter And I think what an appalling example it is
###321 of the new Thoroughfare Spokesperson for the Labor Party that she's spreading conspiracy
###326 theories about the United States government.
###327 Speaker I think this House has heard sufficient.
###331 Webcast explanation of geoengineering Narrator
###333 It is called geoengineering, fighting global warming by putting chemical dust in the atmosphere
###338 and reflecting harmful radiation back into space.
###341 New speaker We take geoengineering to mean deliberate
###344 large scale intervention in Earth's system.
###346 Online video of John Holdren – Advisor to President Barack Obama in Science and Technology
###347 There are a variety of schemes that have been discussed for geoengineering. A classic example
###353 is injecting reflecting particles into Earth orbit.
###357 Web video featuring David Keith, University of Calgary Geoengineer
###358 Nevertheless there might be good reason to be thinking about aluminum. It turns out there's
###360 been a lot of work on the environmental consequences of aluminum in the stratosphere. The big deal
###364 really is that aluminum has four times the volumetric rate for forcing in the small particles
###369 as does sulfur and that David Keith
###371 means you have four times the surface area for the same radial forcing. And this is a
###375 much bigger deal, that you have roughly sixteen times less the coagulation rate. That's the
###380 thing that really drives removal so you can get away, we think, with much smaller mass
###383 levels.
###384 Stewart Howe So that's why we see things like in the Hughes
###387 Aircraft patent from '89, they talked about aluminum so that's why we're seeing in the
###392 surface water samples aluminum, and here's David Keith saying that aluminum has four
###397 times the reflective volume surface area. So they'd like us to think that we're talking
###405 about sulfur, and here they slipped up and let it out that aluminum is four times better
###410 to achieving their ends and it sounds like it's the one thing they don't want us to know
###415 the effects of.
###416 David Keith The little picture is from a nanofabrication
###419 study which shows that you could make very high quality, do this with a jet in just a
###423 very simple way, to make aluminum particles by spraying aluminum vapor out which oxidizes
###427 so it's certainly, in principle, possible to do that so there's a big literature that's
###430 already looked at that. And you could do that by either building new versions of these aircraft
###435 or even re-engineering existing aircraft. So there's some ideas about, you go to an
###438 engineering firm and you want this done, they don't say it's hard or unusual they say, okay,
###443 yes, we could do it. Aerosol geoengineering looks like it's so cheap that cost is basically
###448 not going to be an issue. That means that implementation decisions will be risk to risk
###452 decisions. The risk of doing it against the risk of not doing it. It makes the problem
###456 of how we govern it fundamentally harder and different and um. So I've told you that it's
###461 cheap to deliver materials to the stratosphere and I'm convinced that's true, I don't think
###464 that will change. But I think the more we do research the less easy this will look,
###468 the more complicated the environmental effects will look and that's a good thing because
###473 right now, it looks too easy. So I think if we do more research we're likely to find out
###478 that it's harder and more complicated than we thought and side effects are harder to
###482 manage and that's a healthy outcome that will make it easier to do the management. Of course
###487 the opposite reaction is possible. It's an empirical question how people will actually
###491 react to knowledge about this. And if their reaction is to say these crazy scientists
###495 are so concerned about putting CO2 in the atmosphere they want to think about these
###498 things and that might actually mean we ought to be more serious about the risk of CO2 in
###502 the atmosphere. And by the way it's not really a moral hazard it's more like free riding
###505 on our grandkids.
###508 Dane Wigington Recent air quality studies including CARB
###516 California Air Quality Resource Board have named submicron-sized particulates as being
###521 particularly harmful for human respiration. Through all the
###524 Dane Wigington discussions today I have not heard any mention
###528 of this fallout, and has this been studied and also the effects of a highly reactive
###533 metal like aluminum on toxifying soils and waters?
###537 Alan Robock – Geoengineer The question is what would be the effects
###539 of these materials on human health if they come on down into the stratosphere in particular,
###547 small particles of aluminum?
###548 David Keith So that the collaborators of mine working
###550 on the aerosol scheme are actually folks from Carnegie Mellon who've focused on human health
###554 impacts and while we haven't published it that was the very first thing we did was to
###557 do the order of magnitude calculation not with pencil and paper but with an expert on
###562 human health impacts on whether there could be a human health issue and for aluminum and
###567 a lot of other particles there are a lot of toxicological things that they need to get
###570 looked at seriously. But if you're thinking just about the sheer number of particles,
###573 the human health impact, the answer is while we haven't published I, that was the first
###578 thing we looked at with some of the leading experts who do epidemiological research on
###583 human health impacts and it's not even close to an issue.
###585 Dane Wigington So let me clarify, so ten megatons of aluminum
###587 dumped into the atmosphere would have no human health impacts?
###591 David Keith So let me be more careful here. Let's separate
###596 out the toxicological. The alumina we've only begun to research and published nothing.
###601 Mike Murphy to Stewart Howe Dane looked at him and said, so you're telling
###612 me that spraying ten to twenty megatons of aluminum as you said, would have no human
###618 health effects? He took a deep breath and he swallowed and said, 'Let me be more careful
###622 here.'
###623 David Keith We haven't done anything serious on alumina
###625 and so there could be something terrible that we'll find tomorrow that we haven't looked
###629 at.
###629 Mike Murphy And that, for me was the whole main point
###634 of what's going to be coming out to the public. It's the damaging effects of aluminum that's
###640 being found around the world in massive amounts, and here's David Keith, confronted on this
###645 very issue and he looked, at that point, like they just let the cat out of the bag.
###650 Reiterating David Keith We haven't done anything serious on alumina
###653 and so there could be something terrible that we find tomorrow that we haven't looked at.
###657 Stewart Howe to Mike Murphy They're proceeding because they have an agenda
###660 that's separate from trying to thwart this crisis of global warming. You know there's
###665 obviously several other objectives whether it's depopulation, control, weapons aspects,
###672 communications aspects, it's all kinds of things, you know, wild cards that we know
###676 nothing about. We don't really know and I'm not going to attempt to speculate on exactly
###681 what the agendas are but we can see clearly the agendas are not benefiting mankind. It's
###691 benefiting the agenda of the elite.
###692 Ken Caldeira – Geoengineer And so I think the question is how do you
###694 draw the line between some activity that is allowed and doesn't need global governance
###701 and activities that do require global governance?
###704 President Barack Obama in Webcast Dr. John Holdren has agreed to serve as assistant
###708 to the president for science and technology and for Director of the White House Office
###712 of Science and Technology Policy. I look forward to his wise counsel in the years ahead.
###717 Dr. John Holdren My personal opinion is that we have to keep
###720 geoengineering on the table. We have to look at it very carefully because we might get
###724 desperate enough to want to use it.
###727 “FORA tv” Webcast So what would we do if in the year 2040 or
###732 2060 there's a severe climate crisis, say widespread famines or Greenland's sliding,
###738 suddenly into the ocean that the only plausible way in which we could start the Earth cooling
###745 this century is to directly intervene in the climate system, say by putting particles in
###751 the stratosphere.
###751 M. Granger Morgan, Department of Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University
###752 We do stuff in the stratosphere all the time of course, and so it's not as though the stratosphere
###757 is absolutely pristine. But you don't want to have people going off and doing things
###762 that involve large radiative forcings or go on for extended periods, or for that matter
###767 that provide lots of reactive surfaces that could result in significant ozone destruction.
###772 “FORA tv” webcast You know, maybe I'm putting a particle into
###775 the atmosphere because I'm trying to make money, or maybe I'm putting a particle into
###780 the atmosphere because I'm engaging in scientific research, trying to understand cloud physics
###785 or maybe I'm putting this particle into the atmosphere because I'm trying to make it rain
###789 locally, to seed a cloud and get more snow on our ski slopes. And this obviously raises
###797 all kinds of questions. It's usually risky. It will likely negatively impact some people,
###804 but we might find ourselves in a situation where those risks seem worth taking.
###810 Mike Murphy talking to Stewart Howe and Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
###811 One of the things that really shocked me was in one of the breakouts they had the benefits
###817 of these programs and then the risks. Now, of the benefits, the one thing that was stated
###821 was the, just cooling the planet. Some of the risks were ozone depletion, droughts in
###828 Africa and Asia.
###829 Stewart Howe I gotta tell ya, I came away from this experience
###834 after listening to these scientists for four days of symposiums really concerned because
###843 it's clear now that they are justifying, rationalizing, and looking to legitimize some really really
###854 horrible impacts, further impacts on our environment, and they're basically formulating the sales
###862 strategy and the implementation and oversight strategy and the funding strategy.
###867 Mike Murphy After San Diego, I was shocked by the programs
###870 that had been proposed so I decided to write about it and that night when I finished I
###875 sent the article to an online publication with my email address attached. When I woke
###879 up the next morning, my inbox was flooded with responses from around the world. Why?
###884 Because I had just broken the story on aluminum in geoengineering models, which I had no clue
###889 at the time that very few people knew about. Now this metal aluminum is being found in
###894 massive quantities, way above normal levels all over in rain, in soil, and in snow. After
###900 that, the calls came pouring in from people who were desperate for someone to investigate.
###905 That was the fuel that started the film. Before we started filming we had the opportunity
###909 to sit down with one of our favorite authors and documentarians, G. Edward Griffin, to
###914 find out what he knew about the subject.
###917 Mike Murphy I'd like to talk for a minute about an issue
###922 that's getting more and more attention and that's the issue which scientifically is called
###926 “stratospheric aerosol geoengineering” also called the chemtrail issue.
###931 G. Edward Griffin I am very well aware of the chemtrail versus
###933 contrail controversy. As far as I am concerned, it's an open and shut case. I have been watching
###941 the development of jet travel from its very beginning. I used to live near the Los Angeles
###946 airport and remember when the first jets came in and landed, and man! They make a big noise!
###951 We'd never heard a noise like that before. And we used to go down and sit at the end
###956 of the runway and watch these jets come in and take off because it was a novel experience.
###962 I've been watching jets all my life and I know about jet contrails. I've watched them.
###969 They're vaporized moisture, ice crystals, and they get out there in the atmosphere and
###976 they effervesce and evaporate and then they disappear, and you can see them. The plane
###982 moves along and the little white trail follows along right behind it, usually about ten to
###987 twenty lengths behind the plane or thereabouts and then it's gone. And you can still see
###991 them that way, by the way, once in awhile, and it's “there goes a contrail”. These
###995 other things we're talking about are not at all the same phenomena, at all. These planes
###999 go by and they billow out this white smoke and it covers the sky from horizon to horizon
###1006 and it doesn't dissipate at all. And they criss cross each other, and you see this thing
###1011 cover the sky and turn it milky G. Edward Griffin
###1014 and people start to have trouble breathing and then you hear the stories about the aluminum
###1020 and barium deposits that they're picking up in the residue and you put it all together
###1024 and I don't see how anybody who's got their eyes open and their mind open can come to
###1031 any other conclusion but that somebody is spending a lot of money and effort to spray
###1037 the planet. And my question is why? I've got my own theories but I hope that there will
###1042 be some good investigative reporters go out there and get us the answer. I know that whenever
###1048 it's finally discovered, and it will be, the people who are doing it will undoubtedly say
###1053 “Oh, we did it for you folks, for the greater good of the greater number. It's for society.”
###1058 It's probably to prevent global warming or maybe it's to inoculate the people against
###1064 a dreaded biological attack. “We can't go around shooting everybody in the arm but we
###1068 can spray them and save their lives. You see how good we are? We're doing it for the benefit
###1074 of society.” I know they're going to, whatever it is, they're going to say it was for your
###1077 good and mine.
###1078 Photos from Webcasts sources unclear at AAAS Conference, featuring Ken Caldeira, Geoengineer
###1079 Think of this, if we had the ability to steer hurricanes, and a hurricane was going to slam
###1084 into New Orleans. And let's say you could steer it so that it would hit Mississippi
###1094 instead where for a hundred, that means I would be willing to more or less kill say
###1100 eighteen Mississippians to save eighteen hundred New Orleanians. And if you do that deliberately,
###1107 you know, are you murdering those hundred people, and there's all kinds of equity issues
###1113 there.
###1113 “FORA tv” Webcast Now also, we might be wrong about our steering
###1116 and if we didn't do the research right, maybe our steering would intensify Katrina, and
###1122 kill even more people in New Orleans and so this question of how you develop the confidence
###1128 so you know your intervention will reduce overall damage and then how do you deal with
###1135 the understanding that that you have damaged more people who wouldn't have been damaged
###1140 before while saving people overall?
###1143 G. Edward Griffin – in discussion again with Mike Murphy
###1144 The spraying appears to be mostly in NATO countries. I've seen it here in the United
###1148 States, I've seen it in England, I've seen it in Scotland, I've seen it in Canada and
###1154 I've had reports from people who live in France. There's a grouping. There's a political grouping
###1160 here of some sort and it's international in scope. It's not just a national phenomena
###1167 and anyone who wants to investigate that, I think, has to take that fact into consideration.
###1172 They're going to find a political grouping and a political motive here. But in my humble
###1177 opinion, it's not for your good or mine at all. But whatever it is, we'll soon find out.
###1184 I'm sure if you follow the old advice, which is to follow the money, you'll come to the
###1194 answer sooner or later.
###1195 Mike Murphy Soon we realized that we all shared the same
###1199 need to get this information out there, to share with the public, to let people know
###1203 what's being done. Ed felt so passionately about this issue, he offered to help us.
###1208 G. Edward Griffin Well, the main thing now, since it looks like
###1210 the budget is going to be met, is to get it done well. We don't come off the tree knowing
###1217 any answers at all.
###1218 Mike Murphy Yeah, we're not scientists. We're just asking
###1219 questions. Exactly.
###1219 G. Edward Griffin And we're very skeptical about the answers.
###1225 That's being totally accurate, totally honest. Why can't people see this? They're not hearing
###1233 it. They don't know. The facts are not being presented to them. We're very lucky, do you
###1234 know that? Look at this opportunity that's been dumped on us.
###1243 Mike Murphy I know.
###1244 G. Edward Griffin [laughs] Opportunity.
###1247 Mike Murphy It's going to be a battle, I know that.
###1249 G. Edward Griffin A challenge and a battle, I know that. And
###1251 why are we here if it's not for them?
###1254 KPFK Radio 90.7 FM Los Angeles DJ to Mike Murphy and audience
###1260 I've seen the sky criss-crossed with chemtrails and I don't remember if it was in LA or on
###1269 the road, but I looked up one day and I thought, look at that! That's not the flight path man!
###1275 It was a grid, a grid, a regular grid over the city and I couldn't believe my eyes!
###1280 Mike Murphy Milky white clouds.
###1281 Caller And you know it all seems so obvious and the
###1283 evidence of what we have on the ground with the aluminum, the barium, and the strontium,
###1287 and with what we see in the patents and what the geoengineers say are going to happen and
###1292 for the everyday Joe, this is a slam dunk.
###1295 Mauro Oliveira Geoengineeringwatch.org This is a very delicate moment for the powers
###1297 that be because they're taking a very covered-up operation like the tropospheric aerosol program
###1304 or chemtrails, Project Icharius or however many names it's had over the years and they're
###1309 making overt into a geoengineering scientific shield to deflect sunlight because global
###1320 warming is out of hand. So, at this very moment, the belly of the beast is right above us with
###1324 no armor. Whether people believe in chemtrails or not, the geoengineering should be scary
###1334 enough and when people learn about geoengineering, the chemtrails will then become apparent because,
###1339 they're the same.
###1340 Radio broadcast with Mike Murphy as guest. [station and location unknown]
###1341 DJ So you're talking about a global conspiracy
###1342 here.
###1342 Mike Murphy Geoengineers propose doing this on a global
###1343 level. Mike Murphy Narrating
###1343 We're off to Redding, California. This is the second step after the AAAS meeting and
###1348 we'll see what we find. We're out here in Northern California at Dane Wigington's house
###1362 he owns over 2000 acres overlooking Lake Shasta and he told me about some of the challenges
###1368 that they're having up here. Let's go talk to Dane and see what's going on on his property.
###1374 We'll see what he's going through and also what action he's taking based on the test
###1378 results that he has.
###1381 Dane Wigington You know I have a background in the energy
###1388 fields. I worked in the first solar plants in the continental US in the early 80s. My
###1394 home was on the cover of the world's largest renewable energy magazine so this is my background.
###1399 My goal has been to alert the public. There's a mountain of toxic material falling on us,
###1405 period. Four or five years ago, our skies were typically blue but now you see it's covered
###1411 with lines and haze and virtually nothing you see on the horizon, nothing you see in
###1416 the sky above us is a natural cloud. I mean it is virtually all the remnants of these
###1422 aircraft lines that you see fanning out, spreading into clouds, artificial clouds, but the sky
###1429 has a very dirty look to it. It is not the white clouds blue sky that we had only a few
###1435 years ago, but it looks like we had some sort of massive industrial activity or forest fires
###1441 burning over there and we see that, typically, every night. You see even down to ground level
###1445 the clarity drops off significantly and we don't see that except for the days when we
###1454 have these long lingering trails that spread and cover the whole sky and on certain days
###1461 you can see these trails dropping vertically like a veil. We assume the particulates are
###1467 descending and we have the tests to prove we are being inundated with levels of aluminum
###1474 in particulates that are literally tens of thousands of times what would already be considered
###1477 high. So we're not talking about exposure to a slight percentage higher of these toxic
###1486 materials. We're talking about quantities for example off the side of Mt. Shasta. If
###1491 you could pan back [motioning off to the distance]. That's a landmark in Northern California,
###1495 considered to be a pristine water source. A snow sample off the side of Mt. Shasta tested
###1501 61,000 parts per billion.
###1503 Enter Francis Mangels – USDA Biologist with document of test results dating 07/09/08
###1504 [Pointing to document of Mt Shasta snow tested] This is just ordinary snow water and people
###1508 are drinking this stuff when they're hiking on the mountain. And remember, government
###1512 action is required at 1000. This is 61 times over the government limit and our hikers are
###1520 drinking this poisonous water on Mt. Shasta mountain itself. Barium 83, strontium 383.
###1529 Mike Murphy So this summer, the people climbing are drinking
###1535 poison.
###1535 Francis Mangels Basically. I certainly wouldn't want to drink
###1538 61,000 micrograms per liter of aluminum.
###1540 Dane Wigington And again, we've already seen in 5 years soil
###1544 pHs in this area that have escalated ten to twelve times and we can prove that conclusively.
###1550 It is not speculation. We can prove conclusively that these metals have been in the rain. We
###1556 have duplicate samples.
###1557 Francis Mangels Bachelor of Science in Forestry International
###1559 School of Forestry in Missoula, Masters in Zoology, specialized in aquatics and 35 years
###1566 with the Forest Service as a wildlife biologist and before that several years with the USDA
###1573 Soil Conservation Service as a soil conservationist. Also have run the botany programs, range and
###1581 grazing programs and I continue that. Today I do a lot of Master Gardener consultation
###1588 work. [walking out to garden] When I started this garden back in about 2005
###1594 or so the pH here was about 5.5 to 5.6. This is the old soil survey of the county. You
###1603 can look at the page right here, this is my soil right here. It's at deeds 125, 126 and
###1610 it's right here at my house and here the soil reaction, pH should be between 4.5 and 6.0
###1620 and over there in the pure mud it's even a little darker. It's 6.8 right there.
###1624 Mike Murphy And what can this do to plant life and ecosystems?
###1630 Francis Mangels Well, you hollow one of these things out and
###1635 you start looking at the little things that are crawling around in the soil and a lot
###1639 of times, they aren't there any more. The little soil arthropods that you can barely
###1644 see on a microscope, you can actually see movement with this, little tiny tiny microscopic.
###1650 They look like little pieces of dust. Those start to go away. They're not entirely gone
###1657 but they start to go away. This is black oak acorns. This is pieces of cedar wood. You
###1667 know, come on folks. This should be very acid and I'm getting ten times higher than expected?
###1675 There's something really wrong here. [back in house now]
###1678 You can see all those reports, lots of them.
###1681 Mike Murphy You have over twenty reports here.
###1683 Francis Mangels Well at least twenty, I'd say closer to thirty.
###1686 Mike Murphy All revealing dangerous amounts of aluminum
###1692 and barium.
###1692 Francis Mangels Well, you know, the science is there to say
###1695 that something funny is happening and the naysayers say “Well, so what? Isn't neutral
###1702 good?” Well no, neutral is not good. Neutral is not good. If your soil is supposed to be
###1707 5.6 then it should stay 5.6 if you want the forest to stay healthy and if you want to
###1713 grow a good garden, you have to keep your pH around 6.0 to 6.5.
###1717 Mahaia Sol – student I think that we just need to wake up and just
###1724 look at what's happening because we just can't ignore it because it gets worse and worse
###1733 if we just keep ignoring it and pushing it away like oh, that's nothing. There was Mason
###1735 jars and they were brand new, sterilized, and that's what we catch the rain in and there
###1740 was a HEPA filter that we tested the air with.
###1741 Mike Murphy Okay, so you caught rain and you basically
###1742 filtered air. What did you find?
###1744 Mahaia Sol Aluminum, barium.
###1745 Mike Murphy [inside residence with Francis Mangels]
###1747 Here's another test that's revealing 375,000 parts per billion aluminum. Barium at 3090,
###1757 strontium at 345.
###1758 Francis Mangels Yeah, that's from a lined pond.
###1761 Dane Wigington [outdoors] With EPDM fish safe pond liner there is no
###1765 chemicals, manufacturing materials at all in that pond liner that's available to the
###1771 aquatic life. It's designed for that purpose. The well that feeds this pond has been tested
###1776 and retested and indeed no detectable aluminum, zero. The only other place this pond can receive
###1782 water is rainfall and we're located on a filtered forested hilltop miles and miles and miles
###1788 away from any industry, highway, and so forth. After several heavy spray days there was a
###1793 film that we would see form on the surface of the water so we tested that crust and it
###1798 was aluminum and barium. But after a year and a half's accumulation we had 375,000 parts
###1806 per billion of aluminum in it. It's literally toxic. We can say conclusively that what we
###1813 see in the sky matches expressly what's outlined in the numerous patents and the materials
###1819 in the ground match those patents and this material was not there five years ago. It's
###1824 a recent phenomenon in the quantities it's in. It has escalated in some cases 50,000
###1830 percent in five years in the case of aluminum from original baseline reading of 7 parts
###1835 per billion which was already high, it has escalated up to 50,000 percent in five years.
###1839 We have seen profound changes in that time.
###1842 Francis Mangels Dr. Leonard Thyme, PhD in Chemistry, I cross-checked
###1846 with him and he said the oxides of aluminum, barium, and strontium will drive your pH from
###1855 an acid soil like this up into the neutral. There is no question about it.
###1859 Mike Murphy And that's exactly what you see happened.
###1862 Dr. Lenny Thyme PhD I have a Doctorate in Inorganic Chemistry
###1867 from Oregon State University in which I was working with different metals and oxidation
###1872 states and then did post-doctorate work at Brandeis where I was working stabilizing off-oxidation
###1881 states of different metals. The goal is to sort of figure out how everything fits in
###1888 the dynamic equilibrium of life.. I was working with Francis in Mt. Shasta and he showed me
###1896 some rain water analyses that had to do with levels of aluminum, strontium, and barium
###1902 in the atmosphere so I feel the knee jerk toxin in these chemtrails is the aluminum.
###1910 From the levels we were looking at in Mt. Shasta this is totally, totally unacceptable.
###1916 When you get to metals and biological systems you're
###1920 Dr. Lenny Thyme PhD no longer talking about the bulk aluminum
###1922 that most people think about when they're using, drinking from soda pop cans and that.
###1928 So once it gets to the aluminum oxide stage it just forms a plaque within your arteries
###1933 and shuts down life. When you take elements that normally aren't out in the environment
###1943 and you start putting them in the environment, it raises some serious red flags. Aluminum
###1952 is a very specific nasty to biological systems. It takes that site and it never lets go and
###1959 it shuts down the site and that's it. And so, as you accumulate aluminum over time,
###1965 it causes major neurological damage because it ends up as aluminum oxide that's essentially
###1973 stuck in place and can't be flushed out by normal systems.
###1976 Tammy L. Born, DO [showing Toxicological Profile 4 book]
###1977 At the core of everyone's condition there's always some level of toxins and aluminum is
###1983 known to have cancer causing effects. The half life is decades. I think we should be
###1991 working on taking more of these toxins out of our environment rather than taking more
###1996 toxins in. It's very concerning that if we add more toxins to our environment that we'll
###2000 be increasing the rates and risks of cancers. Even one patient is not worth it. It is so
###2006 sad that they would consider putting aluminum in our environment to affect something when
###2014 they could be causing so much more damage.
###2017 Dane Wigington Wherever that material is coming from it is
###2020 there. The amount of metal falling on us cannot be disputed. Absolutely this is not speculation.
###2026 The amount of metal, as I have said, over the last four years has increased to a degree
###2031 of thousands of times and California Air Quality Resources Board has studied the aerosols from
###2038 China, these metals are not amongst them. Mike, the reason I've chosen to focus so primarily
###2045 on this issue is that I feel, all other issues are secondary. What could be a greater priority
###2052 than not being able to take a walk out your door and taking a breath of air without sucking
###2056 up heavy metals? If our land base is being poisoned, if our waters are being toxified,
###2064 what will we have left to work with? Whatever we choose to focus our time and energy on,
###2069 whatever our political beliefs, that this is a common ground for all of us. We must
###2073 have air that we can breathe that's not full of toxic chemicals and metals. We must have
###2078 water that's not completely laden with whatever is being emitted from these aircraft and if
###2085 people stopped to consider that the atmosphere is as thin as a layer of paint on a basketball.
###2093 It is an extremely thin layer that allows life to exist on this planet. It shouldn't
###2097 be treated as a physics lab and experimented with until it's broken beyond repair. It is
###2104 folly of unbelievable proportion and if people understood that this kind of experimentation
###2111 not only IS going on but HAS BEEN [emphasis added commensurate with veracity of speaker
###2113 here] going on for a very long time, going back 50 years there has been countless climate
###2121 weather modification programs that the vast majority of the public is completely unaware
###2125 of. If they think that this is simply not true, that somehow they would have known that
###2129 it was occurring I would ask them to look at things like Agent Orange and things that
###2135 governments do because they can, because there's no one to stop them, because they have Dane
###2140 Wigington these huge military machines that want to
###2145 control everything and that in fact the government's own document, perhaps you may have seen that
###2149 is available to many online that's called “Owning the Weather”, an expressed goal
###2154 of our government and not just our government.
###2156 Webcast of Congressional proceeding speaker unknown
###2157 We are told by the Associated Press that the American government has created weather-tampering
###2160 techniques so that the New World Order will be able to starve millions of Americans and
###2165 to control the rest.
###2166 Same webcast, different, also unidentified speaker
###2168 There is weather control techniques number one that there are entire patents on the equipment
###2170 and number two that Senator Claiborne tells in a complete statement and story of his own
###2171 that not only does it exist but that we have utilized it as far back as the Viet Nam War.
###2186 Mike Murphy We're Americans, we'll do what we can.
###2189 Francis Mangels We'll do what we can do, you've got the scientists
###2191 behind you. The scientists are with you. At least this scientist is with you. I may not
###2198 have a million dollar budget but I have enough to show that something is dreadfully wrong.
###2204 Inside residence Mike Murphy
###2205 We'll be in Arizona this Monday the 21st with Senator Johnson up in Show Low so we will
###2212 be in the car for a long time.
###2214 Getting out of car at the residence of former Arizona Senator Karen Johnson
###2229 Karen Johnson My name is Karen Johnson. I served in the
###2235 Arizona State Legislature for 12 years and in the Senate for four of those years. When
###2243 you see a plane fly overhead and you see a trail that leaves the end of the plane and
###2250 it goes from one horizon all the way to the other as the plane flies across and it begins
###2255 to filter out and cover more and more of the sky then it kind of ripples. It widens out
###2261 and fills the whole sky. I mean it. How could anybody think that that was the case? And
###2268 then to live, to be underneath that and know that whatever is in that is falling down upon
###2274 you and upon your animals and upon the Earth. It's frightening to me and if people don't
###2282 start really waking up and facing the fact that we've got people that are doing terrible
###2288 things to us and we had better wake up and fight back now. I mean, I'm the mom of eleven
###2293 kids. I've got thirty five grandkids. I mean I've got a stake in this. I care about what
###2298 is going to be left for my grandchildren. I care about it and I'm extremely worried
###2304 about what is going to be left to them.
###2307 Dr. James Rota DDS [in his office] Aluminum is toxic and we know that it's accumulative.
###2315 We know we're getting more. We're absorbing it in our air, we're drinking it in our water
###2319 so we are accumulating more. So the thought of more aluminum being disbursed in our environment
###2326 in the way that you mention is very frightening to us, very disturbing to us and those of
###2331 us who have done any research on this are really quite concerned that we are ill-informed
###2336 about this issue and mostly that it's being done. Aluminum is toxic. We know that it is
###2343 and we can debate about the amount of toxicity that is going to be disturbing the body, but
###2349 as far as really accepting the fact that it is accumulative, it's synergistic then we
###2355 have to conclude that it's just not a good idea to put it in our atmosphere especially
###2360 when we know we're getting increased amounts and especially when we know the scientific
###2365 communities around the world are pointing a finger at the heavy metal toxicities, at
###2371 the levels that we're absorbing in the day to day food that we eat and the air that we
###2376 breathe.
###2376 Karen Johnson So the concern is off the charts about why
###2380 is this happening? Why is this being allowed to be continually sprayed all over the United
###2387 States, all over the world? Who is paying for this? I mean the incidence of Alzheimer’s
###2395 has just sky-rocketed which evidently has to do with an accumulation of aluminum in
###2401 the brain cells. I mean almost every family has been touched by a member, as they get
###2408 older, having Alzheimer’s And it's a horrible disease and to say that this just came because
###2417 people drank soda pop out of aluminum cans. You know, when my father passed away with
###2422 Alzheimer’s and he didn't ever drink soda pop, you know, and so that explanation doesn't
###2427 ring true with me and so I'm wondering how much did this chemtrails spraying, back in
###2434 the Illinois area affect him?
###2437 [back at home with Karen Johnson and her husband] Mr. Johnson
###2444 A firefighter up in Pine, Arizona says the wildfires now that they're fighting are way
###2451 beyond anything that they've4 seen before in intensity. And when you look at the air
###2457 samples and you see the fine particles of aluminum, which is very flammable, and you
###2461 see magnesium that is settling on the trees, this is causing unprecedented savage wildfires.
###2470 Karen Johnson But if you look at this you can see that these
###2474 are parts per billion. They just sent this to me and I found it to be extremely interesting
###2480 because we should have two parts per billion of aluminum in our air and this is saying
###2487 that there's 39,000 parts per billion. [reference to pictured document titled “Phoenix - Air
###2492 Particulates – 7/21/2009] of aluminum. That's astronomical. Barium is high. I mean, these
###2497 are way off the charts of what people should be breathing, of what's coming down on them.
###2503 And you know, people wonder why their health is deteriorating, why they have to go to emergency
###2509 rooms, why they can't breathe, why they're getting Alzheimer’s This has been planned!
###2515 We have a leech. I don't know what you want to call them, one-worlders, Illuminati, I
###2520 don't know what you want to call them. But in with these people that don't care about
###2525 the average person. They only care about themselves, their greed, their power, and if they eliminate,
###2532 you know, two-thirds or three-fourths of us from the planet, so much the better for them.
###2537 Then they don't have as much people to herd around and worry about. So this is a lot what
###2543 this is about and it's very very alarming and scary. I mean, where is this stuff coming
###2549 from, and why? I mean why is some of this stuff [looking at toxicity reports] being
###2554 put out there? You know, I've heard different explanations about “Oh we need to cool the
###2562 planet”, all this and that, but if people are up there trying to coll the planet, why
###2567 do we need all this kind of stuff in it? The explanations just never have really rang very
###2576 true.
###2576 Deborah Whitman And as I'm setting up equipment, she looked
###2578 at me and said “Oh, these trees here are dying.” So I thought,m well then, I'm going
###2586 to test for aluminum, because that's one of the key things in the programs that we're
###2590 talking about, and titanium. So I took a bark sample and tested it and it came back positive
###2596 for aluminum and titanium. So then I started traveling around California and noticing the
###2601 same thing. In Lake Tahoe there was a lot of the same type of bark and all through the
###2606 Sacramento area and Davis, just about everywhere I went. I was noticing this silver white bark.
###2613 What I think is happening is that these chemicals are getting down and destroying the roots
###2619 and then as they come up, they're going into the bark.
###2622 Karen Johnson Now those two right there. It just hurts so
###2629 much to see these two, look at how old they are. We probably lost forty trees on ten acres.
###2636 About every other weekend we'd see another tree that was beginning to die and it's just
###2641 so sad, we'd just cry and to think that that may have something to do with, along with
###2647 other explanations, would really really frost me. Every time we lose a tree, it's not good,
###2654 it's just sad. You know there's another one over here in this group of trees here. Don't
###2659 you feel better when you stand up and fight than when you crawl down into a little hole
###2663 and go to sleep? I mean, my gosh people! Your families are out there. Children are out there,
###2670 your grandchildren! I mean, you've got to do something to help!
###2675 Mike Murphy [on road in car] My greatest hope is to get people to question
###2688 and hey, if they don't wake up while we're there, I'm hoping to plant some seeds. We're
###2692 going to the most beautiful place on the planet, Hawaii, to see what's going on and collect
###2708 some data.
###2712 [Arriving at organic farm on remote side of Maui]
###2730 Unknown speaker Look at this, Man!
###2741 Mike Murphy Yeah, the mind can't even conceive of a dream
###2755 like this here.
###2758 Unknown speaker Yeah, even coming here, one would never think
###2764 that here in paradise that it's getting destroyed. And they're doing it island style. They're
###2773 doing it off the island so you don't see the chemtrail airplane.
###2777 Mike Murphy The theory is that they're spraying off-shore
###2781 and it's coming in.
###2783 Resident Now these are coming from the west. They're
###2785 also spraying on both sides today. A lot of this stuff is actually chemtrails coming in
###2792 this direction. The material is blocking. We should be able to see to the horizon where
###2797 the Earth curves. We're high enough and we have the ocean, right? So we should be able
###2802 to see the Big Island, it's only thirty miles away.
###2804 Resident And you can see it's not a blue sky behind
###2807 it. That's the key. So it's all, you know, it has that weird looking blue, like silver-blue,
###2815 I call it. And this is a nice day. You know, there's no more blue sky. We're going to look
###2821 at the stars tonight and it's like, you'll see it. You can count them, there's so few
###2825 stars at night now. There should be hundreds of thousands of stars and I can count the
###2830 stars. There's like one here and one here and one planet here [pointing up] and it's
###2835 like some nights you'll see a hundred and some nights ten.
###2838 Resident [walking over to two trees] Now this is what concerns me, this kind of
###2840 stuff right here [patting bark]. It's just soft.
###2844 Mike Murphy Okay.
###2847 Resident This just comes right off [demonstrates, bark
###2849 shreds]. It's not natural. I've seen hundreds of thousands of coconuts and I've never seen
###2856 it falling apart like that. Look at this you guys [shredding bark]. I've never seen anything
###2860 like this. I used to trim trees all the time on the Big Island. I've never seen anything
###2867 like that.. That's why I'm concerned.
###2869 Mike Murphy It's not an easy task that you have, here
###2872 on the island. I can see the skepticism because it's so far beyond anybody's reality.
###2878 Resident It's amazing. It's amazing to not try to look
###2882 through somebody else's eyes. Through my eyes this is like night and day. And for other
###2887 people the illusion is just so deep.
###2891 Mike Murphy What do you think would happen if everybody
###2895 awakened to what was going on and what the plans were with the geoengineers?
###2910 Resident Well, that we won't be able to live here and grow our
###2923 own food, and that our health is going to be compromised.
###2929 Mike Murphy Do you think it already has been?
###2932 Resident Yes. The thing is that they're doing it every
###2934 day here, every day. So it's hammering and hammering, hammering, hammering, micro-doses
###2939 every day and of course it's getting into the environment and of course it's weakening
###2943 the plants and it takes a couple of years to weaken the plants so we're asking for GMO
###2950 taro and we're asking for GMO papaya because we can't grow our natural seeds. We can't
###2956 be sustainable. We can't truly be here as God created us to be.
###2961 Maui organic farm resident And so my friend convinced me to do a hair
###2966 analysis on my daughter. So I went ahead and cut close to her scalp and got some really
###2972 recently grown hair and sent it in. I was just sure that my daughter's hair was going
###2976 to be so clean with this lifestyle that we live. And lo and behold it came back and her
###2981 levels were really high in aluminum. This is the chart here. This is the reference range
###2989 and this is where my daughter is. 23.1 aluminum and the skies are covered with a white mist.
###2998 I look up at night and anymore I don't see the deep dense stars that I used to and I
###3002 can't help but think that this has something to do with my daughter's health. I don't know
###3009 where else the heavy metals are coming from.
###3010 Resident I mean, look how old she is [appears to be
###3011 about 8] and she's been isolated here. Anybody looking at the situation would be like this
###3019 is paradise. This child should be like super human, an organic farm. And here you are getting
###3023 all this heavy metal stuff. She has the highest level of aluminum on the chart and has never
###3030 had a vaccine either.
###3031 Mike Murphy Folks, these people are playing God. They're
###3035 playing God; they're manipulating the weather and they are spraying stuff into the sky.
###3039 They are trying to geoengineer everything including your plants and trees and even your
###3045 ocean. Well tonight we're really hoping that instead of not looking at it, you'll really
###3050 look into it. Because I really believe, from the bottom of my heart that we are in a real
###3056 crisis. I really do.
###3058 Earthday Maui 2010 Mike Murphy
###3062 They are proposing dumping ten to twenty million tons of aluminum into the upper atmosphere.
###3069 What does aluminum do? It changes the pH of soils which is toxic to plant life. Also,
###3077 it's very toxic to human health. Are they doing it? Well let me tell you what we've
###3084 found. We have much evidence that not only suggests, but, I believe proves that they
###3089 are happening. The Jeff Farias Show
###3094 Jeff Farias Well, as I promised we are joined now by a
###3098 very special guest, Michael J. Murphy, who is currently on location in Hawaii, doing
###3102 a documentary film called “What in the World are They Spraying?”. Michael, welcome to
###3108 the program. It's great to speak with you today.
###3111 On beach with Bobby Williams and Mariel Hemingway Bobby Williams
###3117 I have a friend who recently, he's always been looking at things from a different perspective.
###3124 He's a bit of a conspiracy theorist you know, and he says that whenever the president comes
###3131 to L.A., there's no spraying that week.
###3133 Mike Murphy [at picnic table on beach] Could you have a better place for an interview?
###3136 I mean, look. Mariel Hemingway
###3139 This is being done over our farms and over our things so basically they want to eliminate
###3145 our ability to eat organic food, clean food, have clean water, and so in some ways it sounds
###3153 to me like, and again, this is a projection but it sounds to me like this is control.
###3157 How to control the masses. How can aluminum be good for you?
###3160 Bobby Williams And what was the second metal you mentioned?
###3162 Mike Murphy It's barium.
###3163 Bobby Williams Barium and aluminum. Obviously it's toxic
###3166 to everything.
###3167 Mike Murphy To human health.
###3169 Mariel Hemingway To human health, to farms, to animals, to
###3172 everything!
###3173 Mike Murphy 61,000 parts per billion.
###3175 Mariel Hemingway And there should be a government alert at
###3178 1,000?
###3178 Mike Murphy At 1,000. People are drinking this [Mt. Shasta
###3182 pictured] that climb the mountain. They're drinking the snow. It's poison.
###3185 Mariel Hemingway Oh my God, that is so disgusting!
###3188 Bobby Williams That's 60,000 times above regulation.
###3191 Mike Murphy Exactly. 60,000 times above regulation. And
###3195 I've talked to friends in L.A. And was told, “well, that's just condensation.” Well
###3199 you can talk to a second-grader ice doesn't float in the sky and spread out that way,
###3203 you know. Mariel Hemingway
###3204 You're not an expert, but you're a concerned citizen who said, “Wait a minute.” You're
###3209 doing the research and that's what we need to do as Americans and say “you know what?
###3212 I want to know what's going on. I want to know what the FDA is doing to my food. I want
###3216 to know what the government's doing with my air and my water and the soil.” And it's
###3221 just great what you're doing and my kudos to you for bringing to light this subject.
###3226 Mike Murphy Put all of the theories aside and just what
###3229 geoengineers are proposing and what's being found is scary enough so we can just address
###3236 that.
###3237 Mariel Hemingway You know I encourage more people to just step
###3240 up and ask questions and do what he's doing. So thank you, Michael, very much.
###3245 Mike Murphy Aerosol spraying of aluminum affects everywhere
###3249 and we have a beautiful tropical climate which I believe might be in jeopardy so we wanted
###3255 to not only comment and bring the message of what people were finding around the world,
###3260 but encourage people to test for the aluminum, strontium, barium. Essentially I thought it
###3266 was a very successful trip. I saw a lot of people here in Hawaii, in Maui, awake and
###3271 not only curious, but willing to look into this deeper and that's my only hope.
###3274 Jack Blood Radio Show Interview Jack Blood
###3275 This is one of the boldest moves I think, from Ed Griffin yet. This is the taboo topic
###3282 that nobody's supposed to talk about and that is aerosol spraying. Now we've gotten tons
###3287 of documented proof of errant aerosol spraying. It just blows my mind that the whole essence
###3295 of humanity has always been to look up into the sky and ask “why?” No, there are no
###3301 limitations. There is endless space and endless universe and now, in the 21st Century we're
###3307 not allowed to do that. Anyone who looks up and sees the giant grids and the Xs in the
###3313 sky that weren't part of our existence until just a decade or two ago is just suddenly
###3319 now called a kook, and the people that are the best ad biggest proponents for the revolution
###3324 of liberty, they don't want you to talk about it because you could discredit them.
###3327 G. Edward Griffin It seems to be an industry that's built up
###3330 to milk the taxpayers by undergoing some kind of giant spraying, global spraying program
###3338 to make all kinds of money on the project and they don't seem to care really what effect
###3343 it has. They're not trying to experiment to see if humans can survive it or anything like
###3348 that. They just want to get this stuff up. THEN we discover, as we're going further down
###3353 the link that there are companies generating genetically modified organisms, the seeds,
###3358 modified seed crops that are being engineered to resist the aluminum in the soil. A lot
###3368 of crops won't grow in that and so now, after they've messed up the soil, the farmers are
###3373 going to have to go back and buy seeds that have been genetically engineered to resist
###3378 the aluminum that has been put into the soil and all of a sudden mankind is completely
###3384 dependent on these companies like Monsanto and these giant agricultural firms. You can't
###3390 even grow natural seeds any more. We're looking at that, and it's a shocking thing. I hope
###3396 we don't find that it's true, but all the arrows right now are pointing in that direction.
###3400 Jack Blood We get into a cost/benefit analysis here because
###3404 also HAARP could be involved in this, geoengineering, as you guys mentioned, which is documented
###3408 heavily in Dennis Kucinich's bill that is the Space Preservation Act, which, by the
###3413 way, I don't thing got through congress. And then Kay Bailout as we call her here, Kay
###3418 Bailey Hutchinson also put together some legislation in order to qualify geoengineering, which
###3424 is supposed to save us all from global warming. But it is cost/benefit analysis because it
###3429 can benefit on so many different levels, Ed. I mean that's how they do everything, isn't
###3432 it?
###3432 G. Edward Griffin That's right. And there's an old adage that
###3433 if you just follow the dollar, follow the buck, you usually get to the source of the
###3440 problem and it looks to me like there's a tremendously profitable industry being built
###3447 up right now around this concept of geoengineering, or weather modification or reducing global
###3454 warming, and all of these other things that can be sold fairly easily to an unsuspecting
###3459 public “Oh, that's good, we don't want global warming,” you know and so they put up with
###3464 this and they don't question and criticize. But behind the scenes, you see a whole industry
###3469 being built up, which is, as I say, tremendously profitable and the money for all of that is
###3475 coming from the taxpayers. And it's a scam is basically what it is. We're just focusing
###3482 on the one area that is really easy to prove. There's no speculation in the area that we're
###3488 going into. They definitely are doing this geoengineering. They definitely are talking
###3495 about it. They're working up formulas for it. They've got strategies for it. They've
###3500 got funding for it. It's already in place. We don't even have to go into those other
###3504 areas to make the case. Okay, let them believe that but at least let them understand that
###3511 they're talking about it and planning to do it and so shouldn't they be equally alarmed
###3517 about what they're going to do if it can be shown that barium and aluminum and some of
###3522 these other toxic metals are very destructive to the planet and destructive to human health?
###3527 Isn't that enough? I mean, how many issues do we need to crank into this? And so if you're
###3533 going to kill the planet, and kill the population do we need any other reason to be alarmed?
###3538 Jack Blood “What in the World Are They Spraying?”
###3541 Thank God people are asking this question. That's all we want. We want to be able to
###3545 ask these questions. Our good friend G. Edward Griffin. All these here, Michael J. Murphy
###3551 and Paul Wittenberg are doing this great effort. With your help this is a community effort
###3555 to get people real information. “What in the World Are They Spraying?” Any final
###3559 quick comments before we're out of time?
###3560 G. Edward Griffin Then my only final thought is that we ask
###3563 the question “What in the world are they spraying?” And we now know what it is and
###3568 folks, you're not going to like it.
###3575 Arriving in Belgium to interview in his residence Peter Vereeke, former mayor of Evergem, Belgium.
###3585 Peter Vereeke I'm Peter Vereeke, I'm 54 years old, I can't
###3588 believe it myself. I'm a very happy person.
###3591 In car now, Peter Vereeke driving Peter Vereeke
###3591 We are doing the job of the police, the Justice Department, or the Environmental Department
###3612 should have been doing. And it's really essential that it's going to be a grass-roots revolution.
###3614 Mike Murphy I think so.
###3614 Peter Vereeke Because we are not fighting against but for.
###3616 I was in the council for about 25 years and also a period as the mayor. So from that moment
###3622 on 10 years ago everything started to change. I started to get a picture of what is really
###3627 going on and it became crystal clear to me that we humankind, have been manipulated and
###3638 dominated and exploited for centuries and this chemtrail phenomenon made me angry because
###3647 I was so helpless. You can decide what food you're going to eat, what you're going to
###3656 smoke, what you're going to drink, what kind of life you're going to lead but not with
###3660 this phenomenon. You are just a victim. It's only a game. And there have to be good guys
###3667 and there have to be bad guys. And fortunately we are in a position to be able to play the
###3674 role of a good guy who has the chance, and the opportunity to overcome.
###3679 Mike Murphy The three days that we shared with them my
###3682 heart just dropped because it was such a beautiful way to live and such a peaceful way to live.
###3691 I left wondering what's this place going to be like in ten years? Is everything going
###3696 to be killed off on the property? And if it is, how are they going to get their food source?
###3702 Are they going to have to take a class and get certified by company XYZ? And what are
###3708 the requirements for that? And that is the end for freedom. I really am concerned about
###3713 that. I definitely . . . I really am.
###3715 Peter Vereeke I've learned to say everything is now how
###3719 it has to be now and everything is going to be okay.
###3722 Mike Murphy It's going to be alright.
###3723 Peter Vereeke It's going to be okay.
###3724 Mike Murphy Yes.
###3725 Peter Vereeke I have this deep feeling that in the end we
###3729 will prevail because we have the right on our side. The cosmos is helping us and I have
###3739 this strong feeling that we are being supported by entities and by forces that we can't even
###3749 imagine. Here for the first time we have this scientific proof that we are being sprayed.
###3765 We are being sprayed, and it's incredible, it's hard to believe but we are being sprayed
###3771 and I think that at this moment to stop is not an option. Once you know it and once you
###3779 have a tool like this and an opportunity like this that the issue of chemtrails or persistent
###3788 jet contrails or whatever name you use for it, that this phenomenon is recognized as
###3796 being real, publicly debated on and the context of geoengineering. I think it's high noon
###3806 to bring this subject to the public.
###3808 Desiree Rover, Medical Research Journalist This is what the sky is supposed to look like,
###3812 these are old paintings, we've forgotten this I'm afraid. In the years that I have been
###3819 a medical research journalist, I have looked at many many things and I've found the same
###3826 three issues in whatever I'm looking at. And that is that we are being dumbed down, we
###3836 are being made sicker, and we are being made infertile.
###3842 Mike Murphy Citizens gathered from all around the world
###3845 in Belgium for this first ever international chemtrails symposium. The event attracted
###3850 the leading professionals, politicians, and activists to discuss the health, environmental,
###3854 and social implications of these programs.
###3856 At the Belfort Group International Symposium Host
###3858 Today is only going to be about facts, documents, figures, patents, licenses, and everything
###3862 that brings us to the truth.
###3866 Chris and Ansgard Priem We have no other weapon against this vast
###3870 complex than exposing and bringing the dark works in the light of the truth. We have to
###3878 hope that by our efforts more and more people will become aware of the fact that we are
###3886 deceived by our leaders. So today we, as a family, join forces with the people who come
###3894 to make it known to the world that chemtrails are not a conspiracy theory but a conspiracy
###3899 fact.
###3900 Eric Cornand From the Techniche University at Delft in
###3902 the Netherlands, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Coen Vermeeren.
###3908 Coen Vermeeren I'm Coen Vermeeren, I'm a university professor
###3916 of Delft University of Technology. Usually people are with their heads to the ground
###3920 in their own two dimensional space and they don't look up. If you do you see more and
###3924 more space like this. And it worried me too. I have no explanations for our students about
###3930 this phenomenon. I studied it myself and I found that I couldn't get them the answers
###3935 that they wanted but that the phenomenon is not natural. It's not natural what is happening,
###3940 and the explanations that are given to us are not enough for me. If you look at it from
###3948 a scientific point of view the first thing a scientist does is trying to explain something.
###3952 He goes “I'm smart and my students are not as smart yet so I have to give them the answers
###3958 to questions. But if you ask most scientists, honestly, they can't answer all your questions.
###3963 If people are using climate control over our heads I want to know about it. The consequences
###3969 I want to know. The health impacts, I want to know everything. I need, as a teacher at
###3974 my university, to give answers to my students. And they have good questions, and I don't
###3980 have the answers and I want to know.
###3981 Mike Murphy Excellent.
###3982 Coen Vermeeren And we should discuss this.
###3983 Host Ladies and gentlemen for all of you in the
###3987 auditorium and for those in the world, Michael Murphy.
###4003 Mike Murphy Well thank you very much. It's definitely
###4014 an honor to be here in Belgium. The people who are in power control everything. They
###4019 control the markets, they control us, now they're even controlling the weather, and
###4024 they can use that for warfare applications. The one thing they cannot control is what
###4029 God had originally made and that's natural organic seeds. This is called the Hegelian
###4035 Dialect. It's problem, reaction, solution. The problem here is massive amounts of aluminum,
###4043 things starting to die. The solution is company X that says “Hey man! You're not getting
###4049 yields on your crop. Everything's dying. But I've got the solution. I've got a seed that
###4055 will grow in this environment. The only problem is now you have to start buying from me.”
###4060 We're a little concerned that maybe part of this agenda could be to kill off anything
###4064 that's natural and organic and to re-engineer it with aluminum resistant GMO seeds. Many
###4071 may know we just got back from a week of filming in Hawaii and it was an incredible trip. A
###4078 bit concern for the people there is they're beginning to see softening of the coconut
###4085 trees but their concern that these programs may again be part of a broader agenda to destroy
###4091 anything that's natural and organic so that the corporate redesigned GMO foods might be
###4097 the only thing, the only source of food for people.
###4101 Unknown speaker I didn't anticipate so many people, young
###4105 and old, who are interested in this phenomenon are concerned about it, and I especially liked
###4111 the address that the young girl gave today. Only 17 and already giving an address to the
###4116 audience is, wow, incredible.
###4116 Sofia Xenedis [at symposium] My name is Sofia Xenedis, I am 17 years old.
###4117 It is quite scary to know that the air we breathe is not what it is supposed to be,
###4132 that the food we eat and the water we drink may contain traces of those substances which
###4139 are sprayed out over all of us as though we are being poisoned like insects. The feeling
###4141 that this is causing me are feelings of deep anger and rage. I don't want to be infected
###4142 with cancer and I'm just so angry that this global poisoning can be going on on such a
###4148 massive scale and not enough is being done to stop this crime.
###4152 Host Let me ask you one question. Are we being
###4158 sprayed? Have we been sprayed? And it is their intention to spray again and again? What are
###4167 we going to do about it? How are we going to deal with it? How are we going to stop
###4184 it? I know the answer. There is only one person who can stop it and you know him. You are.
###4201 You are. You are the person you have been waiting for. We are magnificent, beautiful,
###4206 god-like divine human beings. Ladies and gentlemen, sisters and brothers in this auditorium and
###4215 ion the whole world, thank you so very much for being present with us and for now please
###4222 enjoy this anthem.
###4228 Arriving at G. Edward Griffin's house G. Edward Griffin
###4252 So uh, I'm glad that the weather's been good for you fellows, so far. Just think if we
###4257 were doing this in the wintertime. If you're going to Washington DC you might run into
###4261 snow.
###4262 Mike Murphy Thank God or not. You know, it's interesting
###4267 that of the different weather modification programs there's something like 32 in the
###4276 continental US alone going on so the theory is that geoengineering is, in part, weather
###4283 modification.
###4283 G. Edward Griffin You know, Mike, that's a very good point.
###4286 There are so many subsets connected with this issue of geoengineering. People are writing
###4293 to us all the time with information about the connection to global warming, the connection
###4298 to weather modification. Some people think there's a connection with Morgellon's disease
###4304 and some people think it's a means of transmitting electrical impulses from the HAARP antenna
###4313 system up in Alaska and Siberia. It gets your head spinning and each area, I think, is worthy
###4319 of investigation, but we have so little time, it's wise for us to stay focused on just the
###4325 air spraying and the toxic effect of these chemicals and the destruction of the planet
###4331 and the damage to human health. What more do you need than that to convince people we
###4335 have to put a stop to it? To stay focused, I think, is our mission on this one.
###4341 Mike Murphy Narrating We had an idea.
###4348 Mike Murphy We know that you know the political system
###4351 real well and our idea was this: We have a ton of data and information that we've collected
###4357 throughout our travels and we really think a good way to end the film would be addressing
###4363 this to elected officials, some of the senators. So we were thinking this: If you might be
###4368 able to come and help us out and perhaps show us the way in, how to get this done politically.
###4373 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel It sounds like a really good idea and I'll
###4377 also see who to get to in terms of researching who we should really be talking to about this.
###4388 At the very least if we can make it impossible for them to claim that they don't know anything
###4394 about this, strip away their plausible deniability that they haven't heard of the data that points
###4394 to a geoengineering stratospheric aerosol operation already going on. And at the very
###4409 least it should be very interesting to the District of Criminality, put some people on
###4410 alert.
###4410 G. Edward Griffin Yeah, you have a lot of enemies in Washington.
###4411 That's where all the power comes together and the money, you know. So there are people
###4416 there I'm sure, that just don't want us to do this job, but I'm glad you're going and
###4424 you'll find out.
###4425 Mike Murphy Narrating We took the data to Washington DC. There we
###4432 presented our elected officials with the following letter: According to the Fifth Article of
###4438 the Bill of Rights amending the Constitution of the United States of America, no person
###4443 shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. But the daily
###4450 spraying is depriving all persons within the United States of life, health, liberty and
###4457 integrity of our common and private property without due process of law. As a representative
###4463 of the people of the United States of America, we insist that you do everything in your power
###4469 to protect us and immediately put a stop to geoengineering spraying at once. There exists
###4475 no justification, legal or otherwise, to poison the planet and its inhabitants.
###4481 David Keith – Geoengineer Now supposing that space aliens arrived, maybe
###4486 they're going to land at the UN headquarters down the road here or maybe they'll pick a
###4490 smarter spot. But suppose they arrive and they give you a box and the box has two knobs.
###4497 One knob is for controlling global temperature. Maybe another knob is for controlling CO2
###4502 concentrations. You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box because we
###4506 have no way to agree on where to set the knobs, no global governance, and different people
###4511 have different places they want it set.
###4513 Male speaker on a webcast Solar engineering is like chemotherapy. No
###4517 one wants it, but we all want the ability to do chemo and to understand its risks, should
###4524 we find ourselves with dangerous cancer.
###4525 Unknown questioner How long does it last up there?
###4527 Original panel speaker The lifetimes or years?
###4529 Questioner In years.
###4530 Original panel speaker It lasts for a couple of years.
###4533 Questioner And then what, precipitates out?
###4533 Original panel speaker Yeah, that's correct.
###4534 Questioner And no toxic side effects that you know of?
###4536 Original panel speaker The thing we always wonder about is the unknown
###4538 in that. So if you're thinking about saving acidification, it's clear that's not a problem
###4542 in several studies that showed that. Of course, the concern here is that with so little research,
###4546 there may be some unknown unknown that comes out of left field that bites us.
###4550 Mike Murphy [approaching Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat in Congress Pennsylvania]
###4552 My name's Mike Murphy, I'm a film-maker in from Los Angeles, we're covering an issue
###4556 called geoengineering.
###4557 Mike Murphy [talking with Dianne Feinstein, Democratic Senator California]
###4559 We have a very quick question about the issue of geoengineering.
###4562 Dianne Feinstein I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking
###4565 about.
###4565 Mike Murphy [after cut back to Paul E. Kanjorski] We're wondering if you're supportive of geoengineers'
###4569 proposals of spraying 10 to 20 million tons of aluminum into the atmosphere?
###4573 Paul E. Kanjorski I should really get a briefing paper on it
###4576 before I issue an opinion.
###4577 Mike Murphy Not a problem. Are you aware of the issue?
###4579 Paul E. Kanjorski Not completely.
###4580 Mike Murphy At all?
###4581 Paul E. Kanjorski No.
###4582 Mike Murphy Okay, we have a letter from constituents and
###4585 people have concerns.
###4586 Paul E. Kanjorski [pointing to camera and crew]
###4589 What are you?
###4590 Unknown crew member We're making a documentary about the proceedings.
###4593 Paul E. Kanjorski I don't know. Do you guys have credentials
###4593 to be here?
###4593 Mike Murphy Yes we do. We passed through security as well.
###4594 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel We are endowed by our creator . . .
###4594 Paul E. Kanjowski [reaching for recording equipment Rothe-Kushel holds]
###4594 Please don't.
###4594 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel Please don't touch that. It's our property.
###4594 Paul E. Kanjowski You're lying.
###4594 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel No I'm not. What did I, what did we lie about?
###4597 Paul E. Kanjowski [mumbles]
###4604 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel What did we, what did we lie about? Sir, what
###4616 are we lying about?
###4617 Paul E. Kanjowski [Walking away] mumbles
###4619 Mike Murphy That was a little unusual, huh?
###4621 Saxby Chambliss Republican Senator Georgia I haven't heard of that, no.
###4623 Barbara Mikulski Democratic Senator Maryland [unintelligible]
###4623 Mike Murphy to Donna Edwards Democratic Representative Maryland
###4623 And it appears that these programs have already been deployed . . .
###4625 Randy Neugebauer Republican Representative Texas
###4626 You know I haven't looked at that proposal and well, why don't you let me review it?
###4630 Mike Murphy I can do that, Sir. Actually, are you aware
###4632 of . . . ?
###4632 Randy Neugebauer Actually, I'm going to . . . [walks away]
###4633 Mike Murphy to Cliff Stearns Republican Representative Florida
###4634 Can we talk to you?
###4635 Cliff Stearns Yeah. [Walks away]
###4635 Hank Johnson Democratic Representative Georgia Let me go ahead and get that. [speaking to
###4637 someone off to side then looking at Mike Murphy] I will take a look at this and I will act
###4640 accordingly.
###4640 Mike Murphy to Lieutenant General James R. Clapper Jr., Director of National Intelligence
###4643 General, this openly covert program of aerosol spraying, stratospheric aerosol spraying,
###4653 geoengineering using tons of aluminum, spraying it up in the sky . . .
###4657 James R. Clapper Jr. I have no idea what you're talking about.
###4661 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel It's commonly called chemtrails, Sir.
###4663 Mike Murphy When you were the head of NIMA did you see
###4665 the aerosol trails?
###4666 James R. Clapper Jr [Walks away]
###4668 Mike Murphy to David Scott Democratic Representative Georgia
###4672 Mike Murphy, Sir, I'm here from Los Angeles.
###4674 David Scott Hi.
###4674 Mike Murphy Sir, we're here covering an issue called geoengineering
###4675 and wanted to know if you're supportive of geoengineers' proposals?
###4678 David Scott [walks away]
###4680 Mike Murphy to Tim Holden Democratic Representative Pennsylvania
###4684 Congressman . . . Are you supportive of geoengineers' proposals which is dumping 10 to 20 million
###4691 tons of aluminum into the atmosphere?
###4693 Tim Holden I'm not familiar with that.
###4698 Mike Murphy What?
###4700 Tim Holden I'm not familiar with what you're talking
###4705 about. [walks away]
###4705 Mark Schauer Democratic Representative Michigan I'm not familiar with what you're talking
###4706 about. Could you make an appointment with my office? [walks away]
###4706 Dale Kildee Democratic Representative Michigan I'm not supportive, uh, I haven't looked at
###4707 it so I don't . . .
###4709 Mike Murphy Have you heard of the issue? It's becoming
###4713 mainstream and public and there are actually congressional committees which are being formed
###4717 to talk about the programs.
###4719 Dale Kildee Yeah, well, I think when you drop anything
###4722 into the atmosphere you should know prior to, the effect of that, right?
###4727 Mike Murphy Yes.
###4728 Dale Kildee And if you don't have the knowledge as to
###4731 what the effect would be that we shouldn't do it.
###4733 Dr. Barrett [in Congress] I think there are four different options for
###4736 thinking about deployment of geoengineering. The first one would be we just ban it.
###4740 Dr. Morgan [in Congress] I would argue that one does not want to get
###4744 too firm a restriction in place on small scale studies early on because it will tie the science's
###4751 hands. I think what the science community ought to be trying to do is say do small scale
###4756 stuff inside this space and it's a scientific question what that space ought to be. And
###4761 there shouldn't be a lot of oversight and restriction.
###4764 Mike Murphy to Harry Mitchell Democratic Representative Arizona
###4767 Congressman . . . Hi, I'm Mike Murphy from Los Angeles covering an issue called geoengineering.
###4771 Harry Mitchell [walks away]
###4773 Mike Murphy These guys are running from the geoengineering
###4776 issue, I wonder why?
###4777 Charlie Wilson Democratic Representative Ohio I'd have to talk to my staff. I don't know
###4780 what the details are.
###4781 Mike Murphy Has anyone made you aware of the issue or?
###4783 Sir?
###4783 Charlie Wilson [walks away]
###4784 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel approaching Ralph Hall and Michael T. McCaul Representatives Texas
###4787 Congressmen, did anyone talk to you about the issue of geoengineering last November?
###4791 Are you supportive of these proposals? We would love to give you a paper.
###4796 [Both representatives walk away]
###4797 Barney Frank Democratic Representative Massachusetts Which?
###4799 Mike Murphy Geoengineering, do you know anything about
###4802 the geoengineering issue?
###4803 Barney Frank Never heard of it.
###4805 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel They call it geoengineering but . . .
###4807 Barney Frank Yeah and I've never heard of it. It's nothing
###4809 I've ever heard anything about.
###4810 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel When we looked up in the air today outside,
###4815 you see, we saw this stuff going on.
###4819 Barney Frank [Walks away]
###4819 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel to Maxine Waters Democratic Representative California
###4819 [Something unclear] Have you heard of geoengineering?
###4820 Maxine Waters No.
###4820 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel The proposal is to shoot 10 million tons of
###4821 metals into the air. This committee in science and technology covered it and so we're here
###4825 . . .
###4825 Maxine Waters No, I've never heard of it.
###4826 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel So we're very concerned.
###4827 Maxine Waters [to someone farther away, ignoring question]
###4828 Hey! How are you doing? I'm fine.
###4830 Maxine Waters [to documentary crew] So, what?
###4831 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel Well w spoke with congresswoman Watson's office
###4833 and her press secretary Ms. White, is familiar with Representative Kucinich's Space Preservation
###4840 Act which mentioned chemtrails and the weaponization of the atmosphere and space and then it was
###4845 pressured to be taken off of the bill. Did you see the aerosol spraying going on today
###4853 over the capitol?
###4854 Maxine Waters [Walks away]
###4855 Mike Murphy to Bob Latta Republican Representative Ohio
###4858 Congressman?
###4858 Bob Latta I'll get you. [Walks away]
###4860 Bart Gordon Democratic Representative Tennessee – in session in Congress
###4863 Geoengineering carries with it a tremendous range of uncertainties, ethical and political
###4868 concerns, and potential for catastrophic environmental side effects.
###4872 Staff Person [in Bart Gordon's office] He is not one to do interviews very often,
###4877 not usually unless we pressure him into it, so don't hold your breath.
###4883 Bart Gordon – in session in Congress As chairman of the Committee of Jurisdiction
###4887 I feel a responsibility to begin a public dialogue and begin a record on geoengineering.
###4892 Mike Murphy [to Bart Gordon in the hall] We want to know if you're supportive of spraying
###4897 of 10 to 20 million tons of aluminum into the atmosphere?
###4899 Bart Gordon No. No, we need to have more research.
###4901 Mike Murphy Okay. And about the issue of current deployment,
###4904 there's literally a mountain of evidence that many people believe proves deployment of these
###4910 programs. Any knowledge of that?
###4912 Bart Gordon No. No, there's not a mountain of evidence.
###4915 But I do support research into geoengineering and I also support looking into the issue
###4922 of international governance on that. I hope anybody that's studied it knows that I think
###4925 it's a radical proposal and I hope we don't have to use it but there may come that point
###4931 in time where we do. Mike Murphy
###4932 Now, if we could provide you with evidence that these programs are and have been ongoing,
###4937 would you be willing to address this publicly?
###4939 Bart Gordon We've had three or four hearings on it. We
###4940 have addressed it publicly.
###4944 Mike Murphy Well, not about the proposals, but about the
###4947 current deployment of these programs. Citizens . . .
###4949 Bart Gordon Well, I don't support current deployment.
###4951 We need to have more research and they have consequences that go beyond one nation then
###4956 I think we need to look into the governance of that.
###4960 Catherine Redgwell – Professor of International Law
###4960 Governance is not simply an issue of deployment but governance before deployment in terms
###4965 of particularly of large scale scientific field work.
###4969 Webcast – speaker unknown I concede that on this subject and in general
###4973 it's not popular to talk about global rules.
###4975 Stewart Howe – in discussion with Mike Murphy and Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
###4977 And when those people started talking about the need for UN Security Council oversight,
###4982 a supranational environmental security enforcement with a strong mandate by the UN, you know.
###4989 It really is clear that they're looking for a global power behind the manipulation of
###4996 the environment.
###4997 “FORA tv” Webcast – host unknown But I do think it needs to be an international
###5001 kind of treaty that does tie and bind all nations into a common fate. It is a common
###5006 fate.
###5006 Webcast of Council of Foreign Relations – speaker unknown
###5007 And unfortunately, it's not just big governments that could do this. It is small governments.
###5012 It is billionaires probably who will go “I'm going to save the world all by myself and
###5017 I won't bother to mention it.”
###5018 Online Newscast TVO Speaker unknown How do we decide when there's a planetary
###5021 emergency? Whose hand is on the thermostat? How do we decide when to start? There's no
###5027 way to do that right now. And what if we do start doing it and then by some problem with
###5033 the technology or with the will we can no longer do it? And in a year or two the aerosols
###5040 will come out of the atmosphere and temperatures will shoot up at a rate much faster than it's
###5045 going up now. And it's that rate of change that's hard for us to adapt to. And so once
###5050 we start it, we'll be sort of locked into doing it for a long long time. And with no
###5054 end in sight.
###5055 Webcast “Geoengineering: Salvation or Ruin?” on “FORA tv” - speaker unknown
###5057 Boeing would pursue this to make a profit, right? And has financial motivation to do
###5061 this.
###5061 “FORA tv” webcast – Second unknown speaker And so, let me not speak for Boeing.
###5065 “FORA tv” webcast – First speaker Is that allowed?
###5068 “FORA tv” webcast – Second speaker Well, it is what it is.
###5071 “FORA tv” webcast – First speaker But if some day the US is going to decide
###5073 to do this stuff, they're going to look to a company that can do it and you would want
###5079 to be positioned . . . Boeing would rather get it than Lockheed Martin.
###5083 [Clip to website with an article titled: “Who Gets Rich in a Geoengineering World?”]
###5084 “FORA tv” webcast – Second speaker So certainly we have an industrial base that
###5086 helps the country take on technologies and large scale challenges like national defense
###5093 and we do that both for a profit motive as well as, I think, a national service.
###5100 Webcast of Council on Foreign Relations – speaker unknown
###5102 I think it would be truly disastrous if you know, if we discovered there was a black program
###5108 that some government had stood up to sort of learn on the quiet how to do this.
###5114 TVO Webcast entitled “Geoengineering: Plan B?” - Speakers in Calgary, and Paris, France
###5114 Calgary speaker – unknown It's pretty clear you can cool the planet
###5116 but you will not and cannot bring it back to the exact same climate state you started
###5120 with. So you may or may not, I suspect, have a lot of back and forth about how useful it
###5124 is to ameliorate the risks of climate change. I think there's probably good evidence that
###5128 it is useful but I don't know. But it certainly can't get you back to the climate you started
###5133 with. Everybody agrees with that.
###5134 Webcast of “FORA tv” Panel discussion – First speaker
###5135 Do you think you'll see deployment in our lifetime?
###5136 Second speaker Let me say I hope not.
###5139 First speaker Al?
###5140 Webcast of “FORA tv” panel discussion – Al
###5142 I would agree. I hope not.
###5145 Other new speaker I would see this as something like an evacuation
###5150 plan, you know, that you build big dikes and emissions reduction to try to keep the flood
###5157 from wiping you out, but if that flood should come you'd like to have a back up plan for
###5164 what to do in the event of that catastrophe so I can see those options more as a catastrophic
###5169 response option and not as a way to reduce risk of everyday climate change.
###5175 Webcast of hearing [in Congress?] Mr. Smith of North Carolina speaking
###5176 You would advocate mitigating consumption of beef as a means of accomplishing your objective?
###5183 Speaker in front row Uh, yes.
###5185 Mr. Smith How would you suggest going about that?
###5188 Speaker in front row You can't uh, I can't uh . . . It's your job
###5192 to decide what to tax and what not to tax, obviously, if you wanted to, people do behave
###5197 differently, you'd give them incentives and disincentives for behavior.
###5199 Another speaker I'm sure that's the answer you wanted to hear,
###5201 Mr. Smith.
###5202 Mr. Smith If only my time had not expired. Thank you
###5206 Mr. [unclear]
###5206 Mike Murphy – back in Congress speaking with Bart Gordon, Democratic Representative
###5207 Tennessee Because there's literally aluminum and barium
###5209 contamination found around the world believed to be Mike Murphy – speaking with Bart Gordon
###5213 in Congress from these programs.
###5213 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel Like today over the Capitol it looks like
###5214 maybe they're deploying some sort of aerosol, did you see it?
###5216 Bart Gordon No I didn't. [The rest is unclear]
###5218 Mr. Bard speaking in Congress in session In a James Bond scenario some sort of rogue
###5223 rich guy puts some planes in the air and seeds the clouds. What is to prevent that?
###5226 Ron Wyden Democratic Senator Oregon [Something unclear] I'll be glad to talk to
###5229 you, just call my office.
###5230 Mike Murphy Are you aware of the issue?
###5232 Ron Wyden As I said, I do it through the office.
###5234 Mike Murphy to Bobby Rush Democratic Representative Illinois
###5236 Are you in support of those proposals? What is your take?
###5241 Bobby Rush I don't know anything about it and I'm running
###5244 late. I have to chair a hearing.
###5244 Mike Murphy Okay, we'll give you a letter on this. Okay,
###5245 this is a letter from constituents and many people believe that these programs have already
###5251 been deployed because massive contamination has been found.
###5254 [Bobby Rush's Aide takes the letter for him] Aide
###5257 I have no idea what you mean by “these programs”, one word or two . . .
###5259 Mike Murphy Geoengineering programs.
###5260 Aide Geoengineering. Got it. Glad you brought it
###5261 up.
###5261 Mike Murphy Yes, spraying from airplanes, so what is happening
###5262 is people from around the world are finding contamination.
###5264 Aide Let me take care of this and I'll talk with
###5268 you when I come back.
###5268 Mike Murphy Thank you very much!
###5268 Webcast on Geoengineering II: The Scientific Basis and Engineering Challenges
###5270 We see that even though we might make the average temperature of the planet about right
###5273 the rainfall patterns change some from today and some places become a little warmer and
###5278 some cooler so there are going to be winners and losers in this geoengineering activity
###5286 if we were to do it, but nevertheless as David has said, there are reasons why we might consider
###5292 doing it.
###5293 Mike Murphy speaking with Carolyn Maloney Democratic Representative New York
###5296 Many people are deeply concerned about it because of the toxicity of aluminum, and it
###5300 has been addressed to Congress in various committees. Would you take a look at a letter
###5306 from some of your constituents addressing the concerns?
###5309 [Carolyn Maloney walks away]
###5309 John Barrow Democratic Representative Georgia Please excuse me if I go . . .
###5309 Mike Murphy Can I give you a letter from constituents?
###5314 Are you aware of their proposals of dumping . . .
###5316 John Barrow [while reaching for letter] I'm running a little bit late.
###5316 Mike Murphy Got you. Thanks.
###5318 Gene Green Democratic Representative Texas Well, I'm not familiar with it so I don't
###5323 know what to do.
###5324 Mike Murphy Okay well, geoengineers are proposing just
###5328 that, dumping aluminum and barium into the atmosphere . . .
###5330 Gene Green Well, aluminum is a precious metal we could
###5332 use.
###5333 Mike Murphy Well the stated goal is to actually cool the
###5336 planet however . . .
###5337 Gene Green It sounds strange.
###5340 Mike Murphy Exactly, so they're proposing dumping these
###5343 metals into the air to block the sun essentially. So we're just here to find out what members
###5349 of Congress are . . .
###5350 Gene Green Well, I hope we have a strong hearing on that
###5352 before they do anything.
###5353 Mike Murphy I hope so. And there's evidence that suggests
###5356 that not only have these programs been deployed because we're finding contamination of aluminum
###5361 and barium in the rains, snow, and soil.
###5362 Gene Green Okay, thank you. [walks away taking letter]
###5364 Mike Murphy Thank you.
###5365 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel speaking to Senator Dianne Feinstein California
###5367 L.A. County has seen a two hundred percent increase in Alzheimer’s in the last decade
###5377 and tons of ground water samples showing high levels of aluminum all around our state.
###5378 Dianne Feinstein Why don't you give me all the information
###5380 you have? I have some very good people I will assign it to and if you get it to Mr. Lavelle.
###5389 Mr. Lavelle Just scan my card and send me an email and
###5394 we'll . . .
###5394 Mike Murphy We'll be in touch, we are investigating this
###5395 and there is literally a mountain of evidence that suggests these programs are going on.
###5398 Dianne Feinstein Okay, move that mountain over to us and we'll
###5403 look at it.
###5403 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel And look up, just looking up into the sky
###5405 you will see some . . . Dianne Feinstein
###5405 Okay.
###5405 Mike Murphy You will, you can see aerosols being sprayed
###5408 out of airplanes quite a bit so thank you, yeah, the future of humanity is definitely
###5413 dependent on it so we're counting on people like yourself to take some proactive steps,
###5419 so thank you very much guys.
###5421 Dianne Feinstein Very well. You're welcome.
###5426 Jeremy Rothe-Kushel now outside A lot of Congress was running down the hallways
###5432 to avoid answering any questions, looking for doors in the hallways so apparently the
###5439 war is against all of us. And we're all in a hostage crisis. People who took an oath
###5447 to uphold and defend the Constitution not only know this is happening, but are participating
###5451 in this and all of us have a duty to stand up and speak out about it. Why is the water
###5458 being contaminated? Why is the soil being contaminated? Why are aluminum-related diseases
###5463 going up and it affecting all of us? And thus we all have the duty to stand up and speak
###5469 out and get educated and stop this for our own sake, for our children's sake. It is a
###5474 crucial moment in history right now. As human beings we need to decide whether to live on
###5481 our knees while being sprayed and poisoned every day under continual threat or whether
###5489 we are going to stand up and live as free human beings and seek truth, justice, peace
###5496 and freedom for all of God's children.
###5499 Mike Murphy So as you can see we are ending our film here
###5502 in Washington DC, we've made many public officials aware of this, most of them either denied
###5508 any knowledge of this or they simply were unwilling to address the situation with us.
###5514 So as you can see right here behind us you can see aerosols behind us, the spraying has
###5519 continued. So what is the solution? Is the solution here in Washington DC ? Clearly this
###5525 is one of the solutions, but the solution is not only here, the solution is within you.
###5530 This issue affects all of us so deeply so you need to decide. Get active, get involved.
###5536 Start spreading the word with growing awareness about 90 percent of the population, we believe,
###5541 is unaware of this issue which means that 90 percent of the people who would normally
###5546 do something if they knew are not doing anything because they aren't aware. So please look
###5551 into your heart, use any skill you have to get the word out. The future of humanity is
###5556 dependent upon it.
