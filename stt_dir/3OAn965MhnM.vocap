###10 EDDIE HUANG: Crazy.
###13 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###46 EDDIE HUANG: I like the sound of this motor, man.
###47 LARGO: Yeah, it runs real good.
###49 EDDIE HUANG: So you live in East LA?
###52 EDDIE HUANG: What's that known for?
###55 EDDIE HUANG: Low riders and gangs?
###56 I like that.
###58 Real easy living.
###58 LARGO: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
###60 EDDIE HUANG: Where we headed now?
###61 
###74 BENNY: Low riding's my life.
###76 I've been in it since I was 10 years old-- since 1982 I've
###80 been a member.
###80 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###81 BENNY: We have our meetings once a month, so we try to
###83 come out here, grill, bring the families, and see what's
###86 cracking, what's up.
###86 EDDIE HUANG: You know, the thing is that growing up in
###88 America, you follow hip hop, you watch movies, you always
###92 see low riders.
###92 But I never got to ride in one going down the freeway in LA
###97 doing my thing.
###98 Now I get why people are into low riders, because you get in
###101 and you feel like you're a kid again.
###103 You remember riding in the back of your parents' Lincoln,
###105 like that just big sofa couch.
###107 BENNY: Yeah, exactly.
###108 EDDIE HUANG: It's fresh, man.
###109 BENNY: First, it's a art form, bro.
###109 You know, everyone has their own style.
###111 And this is us.
###112 We grew up with it.
###113 This is our lifestyle, bro.
###114 
###126 PETER: In the '30s, '40s, '50s, they had what were
###131 called cigarette dispensers.
###133 You would put your cigarette in here, and as you're
###135 driving, you would actually open it and it would light
###139 your cigarette and you smoke it while you're driving.
###143 EDDIE HUANG: These cars are like time machines.
###144 You get in, these dudes are bumping tunes from
###146 the '60s and '70s.
###148 It's beautiful to see.
###149 REDWOOD: What up, man?
###151 Big Redwood chilling right here.
###153 Hot ass day, Southern California.
###156 Chilling with my brother, Techniques Car Club, you know
###159 what I mean?
###160 It's what we do on Sundays, man.
###161 We bring the family out, have a couple beers, everybody's
###165 cool, cook up some good meat for the kids.
###167 You know what I mean?
###169 It's all love, man.
###172 We can't just have anybody in here.
###174 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###174 No hooligans.
###175 REDWOOD: Yeah.
###176 And there was a long time when there was the whole era of the
###180 car club wars.
###181 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###181 REDWOOD: Unfortunately, there's still that stigmatism
###184 that's left over.
###185 And they associate low riding with gang banging and all this
###188 other stuff.
###189 But we're all just working guys, dude.
###192 We ain't just a bunch of knuckleheads out here, man.
###194 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###195 
###199 What did you marinate the short ribs in?
###201 REDWOOD: There's a little bit of lemon, there's some
###202 cilantro, there's some secret stuff going right there.
###205 EDDIE HUANG: Secret stuff?
###205 You want to break me off with some of the secrets?
###207 REDWOOD: That's the secret!
###208 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah?
###209 Oh, some Bud?
###210 Some Bud Light?
###211 UNKNOWN SPEAKER: Right.
###211 You know what I mean?
###212 EDDIE HUANG: Cilantro, paprika.
###214 REDWOOD: Turmeric.
###214 EDDIE HUANG: You got a little turmeric.
###215 REDWOOD: Garlic powder.
###216 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, onion salt.
###217 REDWOOD: Granulated onion.
###219 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###219 REDWOOD: You can't flavor the meat too much, because the
###221 meat is the flavor, right?
###222 EDDIE HUANG: Yep, exactly.
###223 REDWOOD: You know that, right?
###223 You need to tell me some of your secrets.
###225 EDDIE HUANG: What I do with the short rib to tenderize it,
###229 beer will tenderize it, anything carbonated.
###230 I like to use a Dr. Pepper or cherry cola,
###234 tenderize it overnight.
###235 REDWOOD: Cherry cola!
###236 EDDIE HUANG: Definitely, definitely.
###237 
###248 [INAUDIBLE] grab me a little space.
###249 [INAUDIBLE].
###251 No, you know I'm Chinese, man.
###253 I just eat rice.
###254 [LAUGHTER]
###256 EDDIE HUANG: The short rib?
###258 It was just hanging out there.
###259 Here.
###261 We'll share some of it.
###262 FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].
###263 Give him a piece, please.
###263 EDDIE HUANG: I got tons of it.
###264 I got tons of it.
###265 
###267 [LAUGHTER]
###270 FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey!
###271 EDDIE HUANG: No, I love it.
###272 I like this!
###274 Yo, so I want to ask you this.
###276 It's definitely not to be sensational or whatever.
###278 But he was telling me about the car club wars.
###282 How did that happen?
###283 PETER: It was a sad time in low riding.
###285 If you disrespected another club, they're gonna get you.
###289 They're going to catch you on the boulevard, pull you out of
###291 your car, and beat you down right there, and
###293 jack up your car.
###295 Bumper jacks, crow bars, whatever they had.
###298 Back then, the guy riding shotgun had a shotgun.
###302 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah
###303 PETER: I said, the person sitting in the passenger seat
###306 now is my kid.
###309 I said, and that's a little girl or a little boy.
###311 And I don't need nobody shooting at me or doing
###314 something to me because of old beefs.
###317 Since then, everybody's got respect for everybody.
###319 You see low rider--
###320 EDDIE HUANG: Well, people learned the respect from the
###321 war, most likely.
###322 PETER: You had to.
###323 EDDIE HUANG: 'Cause you want to avoid that.
###323 PETER: We fought for that respect.
###325 We fought for that.
###326 But one day you gotta grow up.
###327 
###340 A lot of people don't talk about it.
###342 It's a black eye in low riding.
###344 You know what I mean?
###344 We had to go through that to get where we're at.
###348 But we've done it now.
###349 It's in the past.
###350 And our kids will be able to do this the rest of their
###353 lives with no problems.
###355 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###356 
###370 Things ain't always what they seem.
###372 You see low riders affiliated with gangs.
###374 And that shit definitely happened, but that shit
###377 doesn't tell the whole story.
###378 This is something that people really live since birth.
###382 They're not trying either.
###383 They're not like people going to vintage stores trying to
###387 adopt another era.
###389 This lifestyle has pervaded them, and
###392 they've hung onto it.
###393 And for me to come here and be taken in for a day, it's life
###398 changing shit.
###399 From East LA to Persian LA, to here, this is just people
###403 living, man.
###405 Keep your eyes peeled.
###406 Watch for the real, all right?
###407 Fresh Off the Boat with Eddie Huang.
###409 We out.
###409 ALL: Fresh Off the Boat!
