1
0:1:20,92 --> 0:1:24,24
Yeah. You're a good bird.


2
0:1:24,24 --> 0:1:26,56
Take you home, get your Ieg better.


3
0:1:26,56 --> 0:1:30,44
Dear William, thank you so
much for the birthday present.


4
0:1:30,44 --> 0:1:34,84
I'm so happy you remembered,
as few here at the orphanage did.


5
0:1:34,84 --> 0:1:37,52
It's interesting how life
works out, isn't it?


6
0:1:37,52 --> 0:1:41,16
Years ago, when you first joined
my orphanage's outreach program...


7
0:1:41,16 --> 0:1:44,2
...I never imagined we would
become such good friends.


8
0:1:44,2 --> 0:1:47,4
You have enriched my life.


9
0:1:47,4 --> 0:1:50,12
And for doing this,
I'm eternally grateful.


10
0:1:50,12 --> 0:1:52,96
Hope all is going well
on the wildlife refuge.


11
0:1:52,96 --> 0:1:55,4
-Please write again soon.
-How're you feeIing?


12
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:57,72
I do so look forward to your letters.


13
0:1:57,72 --> 0:2:5,64
Always your friend,
Irena Morawska.


14
0:2:5,64 --> 0:2:6,92
Dear Irena...


15
0:2:6,92 --> 0:2:9,68
...I'm glad you lik e
the American Indian bracelet...


16
0:2:9,68 --> 0:2:12,36
...a true symbol of our friendship.


17
0:2:12,36 --> 0:2:15,84
At the same time, it pains me
that others at the orphanage...


18
0:2:15,84 --> 0:2:19,8
... failed to recognize
your special day.


19
0:2:19,8 --> 0:2:21,8
You're an intelligent, special girl.


20
0:2:21,8 --> 0:2:24,16
So trust me when I tell you this.:


21
0:2:24,16 --> 0:2:25,88
Pave your own path.


22
0:2:25,88 --> 0:2:28,36
Do not wait for others to lead you.


23
0:2:28,36 --> 0:2:30,68
You'll benefit more in the end.


24
0:2:30,68 --> 0:2:34,92
By the way, you've done well with
the track er puzzles I've sent you.


25
0:2:34,92 --> 0:2:40,4
Over the next couple of letters, I'll
send ones that are more challenging.


26
0:2:40,4 --> 0:2:42,36
This one's called a cipher.


27
0:2:42,36 --> 0:2:46,24
Lik e I said, it's more advanced,
but I am sure you'll catch on quick.


28
0:2:46,24 --> 0:2:47,56
William.


29
0:2:47,56 --> 0:2:52,56
Friends forever.


30
0:2:52,56 --> 0:2:56,0
Here's another cipher
for you to try and solve.


31
0:2:56,0 --> 0:2:59,16
Remember Napoleon,
the great general, once wrote.:


32
0:2:59,16 --> 0:3:3,4
"He who fears being conquered
is sure of defeat. ''


33
0:3:3,4 --> 0:3:7,24
I suppose I'm just trying to say
that we can rise above our problems.


34
0:3:7,24 --> 0:3:11,24
The answers are all there
if we look close enough.


35
0:3:11,24 --> 0:3:13,8
-Be strong.
-Watch where you go.


36
0:3:13,8 --> 0:3:17,44
In six months, I will be 1 4
and have to leave the orphanage.


37
0:3:17,44 --> 0:3:19,4
I'm not sure where to go after that.


38
0:3:19,4 --> 0:3:21,56
Still, as you have taught me...


39
0:3:21,56 --> 0:3:25,8
...I can see opportunity in all things.


40
0:3:25,8 --> 0:3:29,68
Mrs. Donata told me she has
big plans for me and not to worry.


41
0:3:29,68 --> 0:3:34,4
Whatever happens, I know that
you and I will remain connected.


42
0:3:34,4 --> 0:3:36,2
Irena.


43
0:3:36,2 --> 0:3:37,64
Anything eIse?


44
0:3:37,64 --> 0:3:41,68
Thank you, Rosie.
Do you know any good jokes?


45
0:3:41,68 --> 0:3:45,52
Guess that means no.


46
0:3:45,52 --> 0:3:49,32
-Cup of coffee?
-Just give me whatever he's having.


47
0:3:49,32 --> 0:3:54,12
Look what the cat drug in.


48
0:3:54,12 --> 0:3:58,4
-You thought you'd never see me here.
-I was hoping I wouIdn't, you know.


49
0:3:58,4 --> 0:3:59,56
But shit happens.


50
0:3:59,56 --> 0:4:3,48
OId Shepherd taIked about the mighty
shit you once did for the government.


51
0:4:3,48 --> 0:4:5,48
But that's in the past.


52
0:4:5,48 --> 0:4:11,44
We're Iiving in the here and now.


53
0:4:11,44 --> 0:4:14,96
You saved my ass a few times,
as I recaII.


54
0:4:14,96 --> 0:4:18,76
I owe you one, BiIIy.


55
0:4:18,76 --> 0:4:21,56
WeII, Iet's just caII it even.


56
0:4:21,56 --> 0:5:19,92
No way.


57
0:5:19,92 --> 0:5:21,76
I' II count to 1 0.


58
0:5:21,76 --> 0:5:25,12
Let's see how far you can run
before I catch you.


59
0:5:25,12 --> 0:5:27,0
One...


60
0:5:27,0 --> 0:5:31,32
...two, three....


61
0:5:31,32 --> 0:5:34,16
The thriII of the chase, Mrs. Donata.


62
0:5:34,16 --> 0:5:38,24
It's aIways a constant source
of amusement to me.


63
0:5:38,24 --> 0:5:39,64
Dear Irena...


64
0:5:39,64 --> 0:5:42,48
...I may have to go away
for a while, but don't worry.


65
0:5:42,48 --> 0:5:46,12
You can contact me in Montreal
at the address below.


66
0:5:46,12 --> 0:5:49,88
It's hidden in a cipher
called zodiac.


67
0:5:49,88 --> 0:6:13,8
Remember Napoleon and be strong.


68
0:6:13,8 --> 0:6:15,8
Ania Brotzcha.


69
0:6:15,8 --> 0:6:17,72
Mata Majerska.


70
0:6:17,72 --> 0:6:20,4
Irena Morawska.


71
0:6:20,4 --> 0:6:22,44
Annoucheka Ravinska.


72
0:6:22,44 --> 0:6:24,88
You've aII dreamed of homes...


73
0:6:24,88 --> 0:6:28,56
...famiIies and a better Iife.


74
0:6:28,56 --> 0:6:31,56
WeII, dreams can come true.


75
0:6:31,56 --> 0:6:59,12
It's my job to expedite such dreams.


76
0:6:59,12 --> 0:7:0,52
PoIand.


77
0:7:0,52 --> 0:7:3,64
If you couId be anything,
what wouId you Iike to be?


78
0:7:3,64 --> 0:7:5,4
A modeI. In a magazine.


79
0:7:5,4 --> 0:7:7,92
A modeI?


80
0:7:7,92 --> 0:7:12,6
WeII, you're not exactIy
modeI materiaI.


81
0:7:12,6 --> 0:7:19,56
StiII....


82
0:7:19,56 --> 0:7:22,24
And you, what wouId you Iike to be?


83
0:7:22,24 --> 0:7:33,48
A good student, sir.


84
0:7:33,48 --> 0:7:38,28
Lord have mercy. What a mess.


85
0:7:38,28 --> 0:7:39,96
How do you want to pIay this?


86
0:7:39,96 --> 0:7:42,24
Doesn't have to be difficuIt, WiIIiam.


87
0:7:42,24 --> 0:7:47,8
Just need to taIk.


88
0:7:47,8 --> 0:7:50,96
WeII, I' II teII you what.


89
0:7:50,96 --> 0:7:54,16
PIay this by the books for me...


90
0:7:54,16 --> 0:7:55,84
...and I' II come peacefuIIy.


91
0:7:55,84 --> 0:7:57,52
Sure. By the book.


92
0:7:57,52 --> 0:8:1,76
It's nothing personaI.
It's just too many Ioose ends.


93
0:8:1,76 --> 0:8:3,72
Cabin's a nice touch.


94
0:8:3,72 --> 0:8:6,96
You know, I buiIt this cabin
with my own money.


95
0:8:6,96 --> 0:8:8,84
GIad to see you saved.


96
0:8:8,84 --> 0:8:10,88
That was smart.


97
0:8:10,88 --> 0:8:13,56
Bring WiIIiam to the van.


98
0:8:13,56 --> 0:8:26,8
Take him.


99
0:8:26,8 --> 0:8:31,72
Put the gun down, Shepherd.


100
0:8:31,72 --> 0:8:38,52
Set it down very gentIy.


101
0:8:38,52 --> 0:8:42,72
Now, get over here.


102
0:8:42,72 --> 0:8:44,88
Very good.


103
0:8:44,88 --> 0:9:1,88
Now I want you to turn around.


104
0:9:1,88 --> 0:9:3,88
It doesn't matter how far
a man runs.


105
0:9:3,88 --> 0:9:5,64
He can't run away from himseIf.


106
0:9:5,64 --> 0:9:7,68
You' re stiII a company man, WiIIiam.


107
0:9:7,68 --> 0:9:20,44
And we wiII find you.


108
0:9:20,44 --> 0:9:24,24
It's time to Ieave, Irena.


109
0:9:24,24 --> 0:9:25,76
My American friend.


110
0:9:25,76 --> 0:9:56,84
WiII you make sure
that he receives this?


111
0:9:56,84 --> 0:9:58,2
Oh, that's funny.


112
0:9:58,2 --> 0:10:0,24
Okay, I gotta go. Bye.


113
0:10:0,24 --> 0:10:6,2
Mr. DeIacroix?


114
0:10:6,2 --> 0:10:8,0
Anything in the box for Lansing?


115
0:10:8,0 --> 0:10:13,32
Let's take a Iook.


116
0:10:13,32 --> 0:10:30,92
I'm afraid onIy one this time.


117
0:10:30,92 --> 0:10:33,8
Dear Mr. Lansing,
we regret to inform you...


118
0:10:33,8 --> 0:11:26,48
... that Irena Morawska will no longer
be able to correspond with you.


119
0:11:26,48 --> 0:11:28,36
Let me have your bag.


120
0:11:28,36 --> 0:11:32,84
Be better for the photo.


121
0:11:32,84 --> 0:11:34,92
AII right.


122
0:11:34,92 --> 0:11:38,32
You can smiIe a bit.


123
0:11:38,32 --> 0:11:43,6
AII right.


124
0:11:43,6 --> 0:11:46,12
What kind of foster program is this?


125
0:11:46,12 --> 0:11:48,28
It's a speciaI program...


126
0:11:48,28 --> 0:11:49,8
...for very taIented kids.


127
0:11:49,8 --> 0:11:54,6
Good students, Iike you.


128
0:11:54,6 --> 0:11:56,52
What do we have here?


129
0:11:56,52 --> 0:11:58,32
A Ietter from America, huh?


130
0:11:58,32 --> 0:12:2,4
Those are mine.


131
0:12:2,4 --> 0:12:8,68
Burn these.


132
0:12:8,68 --> 0:12:12,36
What do we have here?


133
0:12:12,36 --> 0:12:15,72
I haven't seen a cipher Iike this...


134
0:12:15,72 --> 0:12:17,28
...in a Iong time.


135
0:12:17,28 --> 0:12:19,2
I think we wiII caII her LoIa.


136
0:12:19,2 --> 0:12:22,12
-LoIa?
-LoIa.


137
0:12:22,12 --> 0:12:37,84
I Iike LoIa.


138
0:12:37,84 --> 0:12:39,88
Whenever you're ready.


139
0:12:39,88 --> 0:12:51,4
And just remember to Iook
right into the Iens, okay?


140
0:12:51,4 --> 0:12:53,76
My name is Annoucheka.


141
0:12:53,76 --> 0:12:59,36
When I grow up,
I want to be a modeI.


142
0:12:59,36 --> 0:13:1,24
Go on. You're doing fine. Go on.


143
0:13:1,24 --> 0:13:3,44
A modeI.


144
0:13:3,44 --> 0:13:6,28
No!


145
0:13:6,28 --> 0:13:25,88
AII professionaI modeIs
suffer from stage fright.


146
0:13:25,88 --> 0:13:29,8
WeIcome to PoIand, Mr. Davenport.
Are you here for business or pIeasure?


147
0:13:29,8 --> 0:13:31,96
A IittIe sightseeing.


148
0:13:31,96 --> 0:13:34,92
This doesn't Iook Iike
a modeIIing agency to me.


149
0:13:34,92 --> 0:13:37,16
Annoucheka, what are you thinking?


150
0:13:37,16 --> 0:13:42,0
Be carefuI.


151
0:13:42,0 --> 0:14:29,68
Annoucheka, no. PIease don't.


152
0:14:29,68 --> 0:14:34,68
You can try to run,
but there's nowhere to hide.


153
0:14:34,68 --> 0:14:53,12
And now, I am forced into making
an exampIe of you.


154
0:14:53,12 --> 0:14:57,48
You' re fast.


155
0:14:57,48 --> 0:15:3,96
Not quite fast enough.


156
0:15:3,96 --> 0:15:7,72
Come in.


157
0:15:7,72 --> 0:15:9,32
-Hi.
-Can I heIp you?


158
0:15:9,32 --> 0:15:12,12
I'm WiIIiam Lansing.
I'm staying at the RoyaI HoteI.


159
0:15:12,12 --> 0:15:16,4
I received a Ietter from you
about Irena Morawska.


160
0:15:16,4 --> 0:15:18,92
I'm sorry, Mr. Lansing.
I wasn't expecting--


161
0:15:18,92 --> 0:15:21,64
I mean, Irena said you worked
outside with animaIs.


162
0:15:21,64 --> 0:15:23,28
Did she say that?


163
0:15:23,28 --> 0:15:25,44
WouId you go with me for a moment?


164
0:15:25,44 --> 0:15:30,84
Sure.


165
0:15:30,84 --> 0:15:33,56
This is where she wouId sIeep.


166
0:15:33,56 --> 0:15:36,2
It was aII such a terribIe business.


167
0:15:36,2 --> 0:15:38,68
Irena running away, I mean.


168
0:15:38,68 --> 0:15:42,28
Of course, I caIIed the poIice, but....


169
0:15:42,28 --> 0:15:45,44
-Irena ran away, huh?
-Perhaps there was a boy.


170
0:15:45,44 --> 0:15:47,0
She was at that age.


171
0:15:47,0 --> 0:15:49,24
And Irena was speciaI.


172
0:15:49,24 --> 0:15:59,8
She was speciaI,
but I don't think there was a boy.


173
0:15:59,8 --> 0:16:1,24
NapoIeon.


174
0:16:1,24 --> 0:16:3,4
You don't mind if I caII the poIice?


175
0:16:3,4 --> 0:16:4,72
Of course.


176
0:16:4,72 --> 0:16:9,48
But wouId your coIIeagues expect
you to return home shortIy?


177
0:16:9,48 --> 0:16:15,28
Thank you, ma'am.


178
0:16:15,28 --> 0:16:17,32
HeIIo. Yes.


179
0:16:17,32 --> 0:16:19,56
We have a probIem.


180
0:16:19,56 --> 0:16:21,6
A man asking questions.


181
0:16:21,6 --> 0:16:23,52
Says he's calling the police.


182
0:16:23,52 --> 0:16:36,4
I told you, any more trouble,
I want out.


183
0:16:36,4 --> 0:16:38,12
You going somewhere?


184
0:16:38,12 --> 0:16:49,48
Sit down.


185
0:16:49,48 --> 0:16:51,0
I toId him nothing.


186
0:16:51,0 --> 0:16:54,0
This Mr. Lansing...


187
0:16:54,0 --> 0:17:5,4
...did he say anything
out of the ordinary?


188
0:17:5,4 --> 0:17:9,56
'' NapoIeon.''


189
0:17:9,56 --> 0:17:16,44
NapoIeon?


190
0:17:16,44 --> 0:17:20,4
A soIdier. An emperor.


191
0:17:20,4 --> 0:17:23,68
But stiII, to some...


192
0:17:23,68 --> 0:17:27,8
...just a IittIe corporaI.


193
0:17:27,8 --> 0:17:28,52
Pretty, isn't it?


194
0:17:28,52 --> 0:17:30,12
But Iike any rose...


195
0:17:30,12 --> 0:17:36,36
...the company must cut its thorns.


196
0:17:36,36 --> 0:17:39,28
I have no pen to write with.
No paper.


197
0:17:39,28 --> 0:17:42,48
And something is very wrong
with the men who have tak en me.


198
0:17:42,48 --> 0:17:44,36
I'll try to leave you a message.


199
0:17:44,36 --> 0:17:46,0
Don't give up on me.


200
0:17:46,0 --> 0:18:19,32
I'll never give up on you.


201
0:18:19,32 --> 0:18:23,56
Pan Pomieniawski, pIease.


202
0:18:23,56 --> 0:18:26,92
HeIIo, I have an emergency
missing-person situation.


203
0:18:26,92 --> 0:18:30,52
WouId you be abIe
to see me immediateIy?


204
0:18:30,52 --> 0:18:32,56
My name is WiIIiams.


205
0:18:32,56 --> 0:18:34,52
Forty minutes? I can do that.


206
0:18:34,52 --> 0:19:19,4
Thank you, dziekuje. Thank you.


207
0:19:19,4 --> 0:19:24,24
Who sent you?


208
0:19:24,24 --> 0:19:25,8
Look.


209
0:19:25,8 --> 0:19:27,12
Up there.


210
0:19:27,12 --> 0:19:29,4
Who sent you?


211
0:19:29,4 --> 0:19:53,56
Wrong answer.


212
0:19:53,56 --> 0:19:56,88
Yes, Mrs. Donata, the head of
the orphanage, has been murdered.


213
0:19:56,88 --> 0:20:15,36
That's aII the information
we've got so far.


214
0:20:15,36 --> 0:20:19,92
How you doing, young man?


215
0:20:19,92 --> 0:20:24,44
Try these on.


216
0:20:24,44 --> 0:20:27,84
Now, that's what I'm taIking about.
See, where I come from...


217
0:20:27,84 --> 0:20:30,32
...we wouId say you Iook cooI.


218
0:20:30,32 --> 0:20:31,84
I Iike that.


219
0:20:31,84 --> 0:20:36,96
That's right.


220
0:20:36,96 --> 0:20:38,44
Listen...


221
0:20:38,44 --> 0:20:43,36
...I'm gonna write down
my phone number and where I am.


222
0:20:43,36 --> 0:20:45,2
If you need me...


223
0:20:45,2 --> 0:20:46,84
...caII me.


224
0:20:46,84 --> 0:20:49,48
That's where I am. You hear?


225
0:20:49,48 --> 0:20:52,32
Can I heIp you, sir?


226
0:20:52,32 --> 0:20:55,72
Yeah, I was Iooking for the director.


227
0:20:55,72 --> 0:20:58,36
I am Detective Lato.
Was she expecting you?


228
0:20:58,36 --> 0:21:1,12
Not reaIIy.


229
0:21:1,12 --> 0:21:3,76
Let's taIk outside.


230
0:21:3,76 --> 0:21:6,4
Mrs. Donata was brutally murdered.


231
0:21:6,4 --> 0:21:9,2
Hours Iater, I find a mysterious
stranger on her doorstep...


232
0:21:9,2 --> 0:21:10,56
...asking questions.


233
0:21:10,56 --> 0:21:12,4
Who are you?


234
0:21:12,4 --> 0:21:14,92
I'm BiII HaIe.
I'm with the GIobaI ReIief Fund.


235
0:21:14,92 --> 0:21:17,0
How weII did you know Mrs. Donata?


236
0:21:17,0 --> 0:21:20,68
I didn't know her very weII at aII.
I just kind of met her in passing.


237
0:21:20,68 --> 0:21:23,28
You don't Iook Iike
a typicaI outreach voIunteer.


238
0:21:23,28 --> 0:21:25,64
How Iong have you been
in Warsaw, Mr. HaIe?


239
0:21:25,64 --> 0:21:28,28
You know what? I gotta
send my boss an e-maiI.


240
0:21:28,28 --> 0:21:29,76
-I gotta go.
-Okay.


241
0:21:29,76 --> 0:21:31,64
Send your e-maiI
from our office...


242
0:21:31,64 --> 0:21:34,92
...as we have a few more
minor questions for you.


243
0:21:34,92 --> 0:21:37,6
You' re Iate, FaisaI.


244
0:21:37,6 --> 0:21:39,8
I'm here, Mr. EIgin.


245
0:21:39,8 --> 0:21:41,8
What is the probIem?


246
0:21:41,8 --> 0:21:45,24
A muItimiIIion-doIIar business.


247
0:21:45,24 --> 0:21:46,92
An empire...


248
0:21:46,92 --> 0:21:51,0
...now more profitabIe
than narcotics trafficking.


249
0:21:51,0 --> 0:21:56,72
It's Iike a giant hand with fingers
that stretch out across the gIobe.


250
0:21:56,72 --> 0:21:59,48
'' Human trafficking'' aIways seemed...


251
0:21:59,48 --> 0:22:2,64
...Iike such an uninspired phrase.


252
0:22:2,64 --> 0:22:6,64
StiII, it's extraordinary what you hear
on the BBC WorId Service these days.


253
0:22:6,64 --> 0:22:7,88
You know...


254
0:22:7,88 --> 0:22:12,6
...I heard about a woman
who was murdered in an orphanage.


255
0:22:12,6 --> 0:22:15,32
I was onIy attending
to matters personaIIy.


256
0:22:15,32 --> 0:22:17,8
WeII, your personaI touch...


257
0:22:17,8 --> 0:22:20,52
...is turning into
cause for concern.


258
0:22:20,52 --> 0:22:23,4
I've aIways proven reIiabIe
in the past, haven't I?


259
0:22:23,4 --> 0:22:25,8
There can be no further exposure.


260
0:22:25,8 --> 0:22:29,12
And I don't want
to discuss this ever again.


261
0:22:29,12 --> 0:22:32,16
Just think of it Iike chess.


262
0:22:32,16 --> 0:22:35,36
If you don't protect your king...


263
0:22:35,36 --> 0:22:38,28
...you're on the road to ruin.


264
0:22:38,28 --> 0:22:47,8
I apoIogize.


265
0:22:47,8 --> 0:22:50,44
-There's a caII for you.
-PIease take a seat, Mr. HaIe.


266
0:22:50,44 --> 0:23:25,24
I' II be right back.


267
0:23:25,24 --> 0:23:41,96
Irena Morawska.


268
0:23:41,96 --> 0:23:48,28
'' United AIIiance of Nations.''


269
0:23:48,28 --> 0:23:50,6
We caIIed the GIobaI ReIief Fund.


270
0:23:50,6 --> 0:23:53,16
Your story seemed to check out.


271
0:23:53,16 --> 0:24:9,28
Just write down your contact
information, and you are free to go.


272
0:24:9,28 --> 0:24:19,44
You're Iosing your touch, Ibo.
Getting fat and sIoppy.


273
0:24:19,44 --> 0:24:21,96
I'm not sure I Iike
this new work, coIoneI.


274
0:24:21,96 --> 0:24:23,48
Pain is your friend, Ibo.


275
0:24:23,48 --> 0:24:25,0
Learn to Iove pain...


276
0:24:25,0 --> 0:24:28,68
...and it'II set you free.


277
0:24:28,68 --> 0:24:30,68
I understand.


278
0:24:30,68 --> 0:24:42,12
Good.


279
0:24:42,12 --> 0:24:45,0
Azimi, over here
and teII me something good.


280
0:24:45,0 --> 0:24:46,4
The American?


281
0:24:46,4 --> 0:24:49,32
I check governmentaI sources,
nongovernmentaI sources.


282
0:24:49,32 --> 0:24:50,72
He doesn't exist.


283
0:24:50,72 --> 0:24:53,8
-Then why are aII your friends dead?
-They very good men.


284
0:24:53,8 --> 0:24:55,76
And the codes in the Ietters?


285
0:24:55,76 --> 0:25:16,32
I want this entire operation
moved swiftIy, Azimi.


286
0:25:16,32 --> 0:25:18,76
You're a very clever girl.


287
0:25:18,76 --> 0:25:21,96
I can see why William
is so fond of you...


288
0:25:21,96 --> 0:25:25,44
...and even more
why I can't let you go.


289
0:25:25,44 --> 0:25:51,16
It's time to devise a killer plan
for your Mr. Lansing.


290
0:25:51,16 --> 0:25:52,6
DigitaI videotape.


291
0:25:52,6 --> 0:25:58,68
Let's get it to the Iab.


292
0:25:58,68 --> 0:26:0,96
You said it was urgent.


293
0:26:0,96 --> 0:26:5,0
I found this.


294
0:26:5,0 --> 0:26:12,52
-It's your handwriting.
-That it is.


295
0:26:12,52 --> 0:27:8,52
We found your Ietter on the girI.


296
0:27:8,52 --> 0:27:42,12
There is aIso this.


297
0:27:42,12 --> 0:27:48,12
I read your Ietter, Mr. Lansing.


298
0:27:48,12 --> 0:27:51,72
You knew how to pass as a voIunteer
for the GIobaI ReIief Fund.


299
0:27:51,72 --> 0:27:55,52
You knew about the message
on the mirror waIIs.


300
0:27:55,52 --> 0:27:57,4
I'm an amateur.


301
0:27:57,4 --> 0:27:58,92
Just a IittIe bit of guesswork.


302
0:27:58,92 --> 0:28:2,64
I don't beIieve you came
aII this way on guesswork.


303
0:28:2,64 --> 0:28:4,84
You obviousIy have a past.


304
0:28:4,84 --> 0:28:10,12
Sounds to me Iike you're the one
doing the guesswork now.


305
0:28:10,12 --> 0:28:13,8
Look, every year, thousands
of chiIdren go missing.


306
0:28:13,8 --> 0:28:19,56
We have a serious probIem
of human trafficking here.


307
0:28:19,56 --> 0:28:21,8
With the evidence I have...


308
0:28:21,8 --> 0:28:23,4
...I couId hoId you
on suspicion of murder.


309
0:28:23,4 --> 0:28:30,12
And you are not Ieaving this town
untiI I find out what's going on.


310
0:28:30,12 --> 0:28:32,4
-Who are you?
-Like I said...


311
0:28:32,4 --> 0:28:44,16
...just an amateur shooting in the dark.
Thanks for the drink.


312
0:28:44,16 --> 0:29:8,8
United AIIiance of Nations.


313
0:29:8,8 --> 0:29:12,68
Irena taught you that, didn't she?


314
0:29:12,68 --> 0:29:15,8
-Irena?
-See, I taught Irena that.


315
0:29:15,8 --> 0:29:17,84
It's a code.


316
0:29:17,84 --> 0:29:25,24
Come on in here.


317
0:29:25,24 --> 0:29:28,56
Men came for Irena, didn't they?


318
0:29:28,56 --> 0:29:33,0
What'd they Iook Iike?


319
0:29:33,0 --> 0:29:35,16
Gangsters.


320
0:29:35,16 --> 0:29:37,88
MiIitary.


321
0:29:37,88 --> 0:29:43,56
And what'd they Iook Iike?


322
0:29:43,56 --> 0:29:45,88
You pickpocketed them, didn't you?


323
0:29:45,88 --> 0:29:47,76
You know what this is?


324
0:29:47,76 --> 0:29:50,44
This is a Turkish fIag.


325
0:29:50,44 --> 0:29:55,36
Yeah, we're getting somewhere.


326
0:29:55,36 --> 0:29:58,32
This is the
Irena Morawska case, right?


327
0:29:58,32 --> 0:30:3,48
Detective Lato said that you
were having troubIe with the tape?


328
0:30:3,48 --> 0:31:2,84
See, now, this is a simpIe case
of signaI vs. digitaI throughput.


329
0:31:2,84 --> 0:31:4,72
You think this is funny?


330
0:31:4,72 --> 0:31:13,68
You want to get drunk?


331
0:31:13,68 --> 0:31:16,64
It's Iike a big ring.


332
0:31:16,64 --> 0:31:19,8
-And what's this here?
-Embassies.


333
0:31:19,8 --> 0:31:27,96
-DipIomats.
-Embassies and dipIomats?


334
0:31:27,96 --> 0:31:30,12
Annoucheka.


335
0:31:30,12 --> 0:31:31,52
That's right.


336
0:31:31,52 --> 0:31:33,52
You saw who took the girIs.


337
0:31:33,52 --> 0:32:3,44
HeIp me, Nikki, and I'II make sure
that this doesn't happen again.


338
0:32:3,44 --> 0:32:8,4
Why the Iong face, Weiss, huh?


339
0:32:8,4 --> 0:32:11,16
This is the best shipment we've had
in a Iong time.


340
0:32:11,16 --> 0:32:16,32
Don't teII me you're getting soft
on me now, are you?


341
0:32:16,32 --> 0:32:21,92
That's it, foIIow me.


342
0:32:21,92 --> 0:32:25,36
Thank you.


343
0:32:25,36 --> 0:32:28,8
No, Iet her stay.


344
0:32:28,8 --> 0:32:32,12
-Hi.
-Hi.


345
0:32:32,12 --> 0:32:35,84
TeII me, what move
wouId you make, huh?


346
0:32:35,84 --> 0:32:41,56
You have the wrong pieces
protecting your king.


347
0:32:41,56 --> 0:32:44,32
Check.


348
0:32:44,32 --> 0:32:45,92
Smart move.


349
0:32:45,92 --> 0:33:9,96
Very smart.


350
0:33:9,96 --> 0:33:12,24
Good afternoon, madam.
I am Mr. DiMonroe.


351
0:33:12,24 --> 0:33:14,92
I'm here with the InternationaI
Education Fund.


352
0:33:14,92 --> 0:33:17,12
Who shouId I see about donations?


353
0:33:17,12 --> 0:33:21,8
I think you have to taIk to Mr. Weiss
in Finance and Operations...


354
0:33:21,8 --> 0:33:22,96
...but he's stiII out to Iunch.


355
0:33:22,96 --> 0:33:51,72
Okay, weII, I' II just wait over here.
Thank you.


356
0:33:51,72 --> 0:33:53,4
Any messages for me?


357
0:33:53,4 --> 0:33:56,52
The man from the American Education
Fund asking about donations.


358
0:33:56,52 --> 0:34:11,56
I toId him to wait.


359
0:34:11,56 --> 0:34:14,44
Mr. Weiss, I have been waiting here
for a haIf an hour.


360
0:34:14,44 --> 0:34:16,6
You know, they say time is money...


361
0:34:16,6 --> 0:34:19,72
...and I've been known to make
some very Iarge donations.


362
0:34:19,72 --> 0:34:26,28
But it's a IittIe thing
caIIed respect, you know.


363
0:34:26,28 --> 0:34:29,0
You shouId bring that American in.


364
0:34:29,0 --> 0:34:31,8
I don't think he did it.


365
0:34:31,8 --> 0:34:33,32
Do you have anything new?


366
0:34:33,32 --> 0:34:48,68
The girI. She came from a U AN
schooI, Iike aII the other missing girIs.


367
0:34:48,68 --> 0:34:52,8
My friend Annoucheka.
I heard her screaming.


368
0:34:52,8 --> 0:34:55,36
As Iong as you do as you are toId,
you're aII right, LoIa.


369
0:34:55,36 --> 0:34:56,96
My name is Irena.


370
0:34:56,96 --> 0:35:32,48
Sure it is. Eat your food.


371
0:35:32,48 --> 0:36:19,72
Missing-peopIe department, pIease.


372
0:36:19,72 --> 0:36:21,96
This is Weiss. All tapes delivered.


373
0:36:21,96 --> 0:36:39,32
International online bidding
will commence now.


374
0:36:39,32 --> 0:36:49,52
'' Max-Com Internet.''


375
0:36:49,52 --> 0:36:56,28
Washington paid 7 5, 000.


376
0:36:56,28 --> 0:37:17,56
London bids 200, 000.


377
0:37:17,56 --> 0:37:21,4
I trust my men won't have any probIem
at the embassy baII.


378
0:37:21,4 --> 0:37:27,24
It's not a probIem.


379
0:37:27,24 --> 0:37:30,2
Mr. Lansing seems to have ignored
our message.


380
0:37:30,2 --> 0:37:33,84
But if he thinks the girI is dead,
then he is not a probIem.


381
0:37:33,84 --> 0:37:37,76
Some homicide detective phoned
Weiss asking about schooI records.


382
0:37:37,76 --> 0:37:46,12
-Weiss sent out the shipment of tapes.
-Time to ship him out.


383
0:37:46,12 --> 0:37:50,72
Missing chiIdren.
You've not heard anything?


384
0:37:50,72 --> 0:37:53,4
You don't want this case, Kasia.


385
0:37:53,4 --> 0:37:57,64
And if your father was aIive,
he'd teII you the same thing.


386
0:37:57,64 --> 0:38:3,8
I thought I'd find you guys here.


387
0:38:3,8 --> 0:38:9,32
Kasia, be smart. Stay out of troubIe.


388
0:38:9,32 --> 0:38:13,88
You know, maybe you shouIdn't be
drinking with foIks Iike that.


389
0:38:13,88 --> 0:38:16,8
Maybe I shouIdn't be drinking
with you.


390
0:38:16,8 --> 0:38:19,48
Besides...


391
0:38:19,48 --> 0:38:21,84
...he's my uncIe.


392
0:38:21,84 --> 0:38:29,0
Did I offend you?


393
0:38:29,0 --> 0:38:32,52
So to what do I owe this visit?


394
0:38:32,52 --> 0:38:36,4
If there was an iIIegaI Internet service
in Warsaw...


395
0:38:36,4 --> 0:38:39,48
-...who wouId I taIk to about it?
-Maybe you shouId ask my uncIe.


396
0:38:39,48 --> 0:38:43,24
Look, you want reaI information,
you teII me something good.


397
0:38:43,24 --> 0:38:48,52
Okay. The girI from the warehouse,
her name was Annoucheka Ravinska.


398
0:38:48,52 --> 0:38:51,24
-I aIready know that.
-Okay.


399
0:38:51,24 --> 0:38:55,32
-There's a man caIIed Weiss.
-From the U AN. I know that too.


400
0:38:55,32 --> 0:38:57,8
He has information for me
back at his house.


401
0:38:57,8 --> 0:39:0,48
Aside from the joking,
these peopIe are serious...


402
0:39:0,48 --> 0:39:4,28
-...and they don't care who they kiII.
-I can take care of myseIf.


403
0:39:4,28 --> 0:39:8,52
Can I ask you a question?
How much have you had to drink?


404
0:39:8,52 --> 0:39:11,24
Why don't I be
your designated driver.


405
0:39:11,24 --> 0:39:15,4
Give me the keys.
I' II take you where you want to go.


406
0:39:15,4 --> 0:40:39,72
Okay.


407
0:40:39,72 --> 0:40:41,76
Oh, man. You're gonna be aII right.


408
0:40:41,76 --> 0:40:54,4
Just Iie down. ReIax.


409
0:40:54,4 --> 0:40:58,44
You have to drink and get rid
of some of this pain.


410
0:40:58,44 --> 0:41:2,4
LittIe bit more.


411
0:41:2,4 --> 0:41:3,64
It wiII take away the pain.


412
0:41:3,64 --> 0:41:11,72
Lie down.


413
0:41:11,72 --> 0:41:21,6
You' re gonna be aII right.
Just stay with me.


414
0:41:21,6 --> 0:41:24,24
I'm gonna cauterise this
to stop the bIeeding.


415
0:41:24,24 --> 0:41:28,16
Come on. Wake up. Stay with me.
Lie down. ReIax.


416
0:41:28,16 --> 0:41:32,4
We' re done.


417
0:41:32,4 --> 0:41:35,4
It's over.


418
0:41:35,4 --> 0:41:36,8
You did good.


419
0:41:36,8 --> 0:41:42,32
You did good.


420
0:41:42,32 --> 0:41:45,32
-Did you get the mail?
-Where's the Ietter from Max-Com?


421
0:41:45,32 --> 0:41:47,64
It was delivered.
It should be on the shelf.


422
0:41:47,64 --> 0:41:51,56
Then somebody's been in here.


423
0:41:51,56 --> 0:41:53,64
Is it done?


424
0:41:53,64 --> 0:41:55,96
Weiss and his mistress, yes.


425
0:41:55,96 --> 0:41:58,92
What about the femaIe homicide
detective? Was she there?


426
0:41:58,92 --> 0:42:1,88
Yes, but we have a sIight probIem.


427
0:42:1,88 --> 0:42:6,12
The American was there.


428
0:42:6,12 --> 0:42:7,8
Let's see...


429
0:42:7,8 --> 0:42:12,2
...if you can do something right.


430
0:42:12,2 --> 0:42:20,84
Shoot me.


431
0:42:20,84 --> 0:42:26,84
Do it!


432
0:42:26,84 --> 0:42:30,88
You know what the probIem
with my father was?


433
0:42:30,88 --> 0:42:51,4
He wasn't hard enough on me.


434
0:42:51,4 --> 0:42:55,88
Don't worry, I cIosed my eyes
during the procedure.


435
0:42:55,88 --> 0:42:57,36
Where did you Iearn this?


436
0:42:57,36 --> 0:42:59,88
I've been around a coupIe of pIaces.


437
0:42:59,88 --> 0:43:4,28
You were in the miIitary, weren't you?


438
0:43:4,28 --> 0:43:9,6
PIease don't move.


439
0:43:9,6 --> 0:43:12,52
The peopIe who kiIIed Weiss
are going to Iook for us...


440
0:43:12,52 --> 0:43:15,36
...so we have to be very carefuI.


441
0:43:15,36 --> 0:43:17,68
Who's behind aII of this?


442
0:43:17,68 --> 0:43:23,92
I think they're peopIe with dipIomatic
connections. PossibIy Turkish.


443
0:43:23,92 --> 0:43:26,32
Whatever you do,
don't caII your coIIeagues.


444
0:43:26,32 --> 0:43:30,88
It wiII onIy endanger their Iives.


445
0:43:30,88 --> 0:43:43,72
I made a mistake once. I'm not gonna
make the same mistake again.


446
0:43:43,72 --> 0:43:46,52
Good morning, coIoneI.


447
0:43:46,52 --> 0:43:49,96
Your message seemed rather vague.


448
0:43:49,96 --> 0:43:52,96
Like I said, I'm a stranger
going to the West.


449
0:43:52,96 --> 0:43:54,6
Where are you from?


450
0:43:54,6 --> 0:43:59,56
What if I said I was from the East?


451
0:43:59,56 --> 0:44:2,0
What do you want, friend?


452
0:44:2,0 --> 0:44:6,2
I think we both know
where this comes from, coIoneI.


453
0:44:6,2 --> 0:44:8,32
I don't understand.


454
0:44:8,32 --> 0:44:12,76
I hear you're Iooking for a man
who writes Ietters.


455
0:44:12,76 --> 0:44:16,2
And why is this
of any interest to you?


456
0:44:16,2 --> 0:44:22,8
Let's just say I couId heIp you
put a face to the name.


457
0:44:22,8 --> 0:44:24,88
I' II have somebody contact you.


458
0:44:24,88 --> 0:44:26,84
Your business isn't my concern.


459
0:44:26,84 --> 0:44:46,12
We need to put an oId dog
out of his misery.


460
0:44:46,12 --> 0:44:50,92
Find something interesting?


461
0:44:50,92 --> 0:44:53,72
Is this your home?


462
0:44:53,72 --> 0:44:56,4
One of many.


463
0:44:56,4 --> 0:44:58,28
Where's your reaI home?


464
0:44:58,28 --> 0:45:1,92
It's everywhere.


465
0:45:1,92 --> 0:45:5,92
TeII me about
your new friend WiIIiam.


466
0:45:5,92 --> 0:45:8,2
He's nice.


467
0:45:8,2 --> 0:45:11,88
Nice?


468
0:45:11,88 --> 0:45:14,64
Nice?


469
0:45:14,64 --> 0:45:25,68
Is that aII?


470
0:45:25,68 --> 0:45:28,8
You're onto where the chiIdren
might be.


471
0:45:28,8 --> 0:45:31,16
WeII, I'II teII you what,
I think this company, Itara...


472
0:45:31,16 --> 0:45:42,52
...has got an onIine Internet scam
seIIing peopIe aII over the worId.


473
0:45:42,52 --> 0:45:45,28
It fits.


474
0:45:45,28 --> 0:45:52,12
-What do you think?
-Good to go.


475
0:45:52,12 --> 0:45:54,72
WouId you Iike to go to a party?


476
0:45:54,72 --> 0:45:56,52
An embassy baII.


477
0:45:56,52 --> 0:46:0,16
What wouId you be doing
at an embassy baII?


478
0:46:0,16 --> 0:46:4,4
Business, pIeasure.


479
0:46:4,4 --> 0:46:7,28
Just Iike this game of chess.


480
0:46:7,28 --> 0:46:15,28
SimpIy about the moves you make.


481
0:46:15,28 --> 0:46:22,92
WeII?


482
0:46:22,92 --> 0:46:29,36
Check.


483
0:46:29,36 --> 0:46:35,4
Check.


484
0:46:35,4 --> 0:46:40,24
Mate.


485
0:46:40,24 --> 0:46:42,56
I want to go home now.


486
0:46:42,56 --> 0:46:44,2
You are home, dear.


487
0:46:44,2 --> 0:46:45,96
My friend...


488
0:46:45,96 --> 0:46:48,24
...WiIIiam...


489
0:46:48,24 --> 0:46:50,48
...he' II come.


490
0:46:50,48 --> 0:46:52,84
You'II see.


491
0:46:52,84 --> 0:46:55,8
I Iook forward to meeting him.


492
0:46:55,8 --> 0:47:4,4
The sooner the better.


493
0:47:4,4 --> 0:48:8,8
Is that him?


494
0:48:8,8 --> 0:48:12,8
Is that the man?


495
0:48:12,8 --> 0:48:16,88
Son, is that the man?


496
0:48:16,88 --> 0:48:25,16
Yes.


497
0:48:25,16 --> 0:48:35,52
What I need to do is get an invitation
to this embassy baII.


498
0:48:35,52 --> 0:48:37,12
I'm hungry.


499
0:48:37,12 --> 0:48:38,44
The caviar Iooks nice.


500
0:48:38,44 --> 0:48:41,28
I'II bring you food
after I put you downstairs. WaIk.


501
0:48:41,28 --> 0:48:44,12
I think you're gonna drug my food,
and I won't eat it.


502
0:48:44,12 --> 0:48:45,64
Your food won't be drugged.


503
0:48:45,64 --> 0:48:48,68
If you don't Iet me eat
some of that caviar, I' II scream.


504
0:48:48,68 --> 0:48:50,48
No, you won't.


505
0:48:50,48 --> 0:49:5,64
Let her eat.


506
0:49:5,64 --> 0:49:9,0
This...


507
0:49:9,0 --> 0:49:12,36
... is...


508
0:49:12,36 --> 0:49:22,64
...a trap.


509
0:49:22,64 --> 0:49:32,92
You had enough.


510
0:49:32,92 --> 0:49:36,68
Make sure no one touches this.


511
0:49:36,68 --> 0:49:40,4
It's been a whiIe, my friend.


512
0:49:40,4 --> 0:49:43,68
Yes, it has. How are you?


513
0:49:43,68 --> 0:49:45,16
What can I do for you?


514
0:49:45,16 --> 0:49:49,68
I was thinking, I wanted to get into
the Turkish embassy baII tonight.


515
0:49:49,68 --> 0:49:52,44
Thought maybe you couId arrange
a speciaI pass.


516
0:49:52,44 --> 0:49:55,32
I'm not certain
that I can heIp you this time.


517
0:49:55,32 --> 0:49:57,64
AII right. WeII, I'm sorry for asking.


518
0:49:57,64 --> 0:50:3,32
I' II just go to our oId friends
in Moscow and do it Iike that.


519
0:50:3,32 --> 0:50:7,56
Right, I want both of these stairweIIs
covered in case he tries to exit.


520
0:50:7,56 --> 0:50:12,4
Hey. GentIemen,
wiII you excuse me for a second?


521
0:50:12,4 --> 0:50:14,56
There's somebody
who wants to see you, sir.


522
0:50:14,56 --> 0:50:17,92
He says that your friend
who was traveIIing West sent him.


523
0:50:17,92 --> 0:50:19,4
TraveIIing West?


524
0:50:19,4 --> 0:50:26,2
Yes. Ibo, take over for me.


525
0:50:26,2 --> 0:50:28,36
Where are you going so dressed up?


526
0:50:28,36 --> 0:50:31,2
Got a rentaI car in the parking Iot.


527
0:50:31,2 --> 0:50:33,12
Here's the keys.


528
0:50:33,12 --> 0:50:35,8
Cash in the gIove box.


529
0:50:35,8 --> 0:50:38,92
If you Ieave now, you couId hit
the Czech border by nightfaII.


530
0:50:38,92 --> 0:50:41,0
How about you?


531
0:50:41,0 --> 0:50:44,8
I'd Iike you to keep going.
Don't stop for anyone. Not even to eat.


532
0:50:44,8 --> 0:50:47,28
When you get to the CapitaI HoteI,
caII me.


533
0:50:47,28 --> 0:50:49,88
-You' re Ieaving us, aren't you?
-Not exactIy.


534
0:50:49,88 --> 0:50:52,96
I just think this couId get
a IittIe bit dangerous...


535
0:50:52,96 --> 0:50:56,4
-...and I don't want you around.
-You said we were friends.


536
0:50:56,4 --> 0:51:1,6
Yeah, we are friends.
Nothing to do with that.


537
0:51:1,6 --> 0:51:6,76
Come here, give me a hug.


538
0:51:6,76 --> 0:51:10,8
AII right.


539
0:51:10,8 --> 0:51:23,84
-Take care of her.
-You gonna give her a hug?


540
0:51:23,84 --> 0:51:25,8
Be safe, guys.


541
0:51:25,8 --> 0:51:54,84
Be carefuI.


542
0:51:54,84 --> 0:51:57,44
Why didn't they invite you
to the party upstairs?


543
0:51:57,44 --> 0:52:1,92
Stop trying to get inside my head.


544
0:52:1,92 --> 0:52:5,28
I shouId be upstairs on point,
not down here pIaying babysitter.


545
0:52:5,28 --> 0:52:10,92
Besides, I'm the onIy one
who can identify this guy.


546
0:52:10,92 --> 0:52:20,68
That's why you're here.


547
0:52:20,68 --> 0:52:22,64
Now...


548
0:52:22,64 --> 0:53:3,24
...if anyone comes through that door,
you know what to do, right?


549
0:53:3,24 --> 0:53:40,36
-How are you? Nice to see you.
-How are you? Very nice to see you.


550
0:53:40,36 --> 0:54:1,16
Either put that thing out
or open the door.


551
0:54:1,16 --> 0:54:3,84
HeIIo, Mr. Morak.


552
0:54:3,84 --> 0:54:6,4
My friend from Russia,
NikoIai Verchinko.


553
0:54:6,4 --> 0:54:12,28
-Nice to meet you.
-A businessman.


554
0:54:12,28 --> 0:54:16,28
-I wouId Iove to, very much.
-My oId friend NikoIai Verchinko.


555
0:54:16,28 --> 0:54:27,24
Friend from Russia.


556
0:54:27,24 --> 0:54:30,0
-FaisaI.
-AIways a pIeasure, VasiIy.


557
0:54:30,0 --> 0:54:31,56
How are you?


558
0:54:31,56 --> 0:54:34,24
-Who's this?
-I'm NikoIai Verchinko.


559
0:54:34,24 --> 0:54:36,68
-It's nice to meet you.
-A firm grip there...


560
0:54:36,68 --> 0:54:39,2
...and your name is indeed famiIiar.


561
0:54:39,2 --> 0:54:43,76
No, no. Bring the speciaI caviar
for our Russian guest.


562
0:54:43,76 --> 0:54:47,4
So maybe we'II speak again
in a more intimate setting.


563
0:54:47,4 --> 0:54:48,4
-Perhaps.
-Yeah.


564
0:54:48,4 --> 0:55:20,2
Some food?


565
0:55:20,2 --> 0:55:23,16
CompIiments of Mr. FaisaI.


566
0:55:23,16 --> 0:55:25,32
An eIegant arrangement.


567
0:55:25,32 --> 0:55:29,88
My compIiments to the chef.


568
0:55:29,88 --> 0:55:33,32
This is a trap.


569
0:55:33,32 --> 0:55:35,72
You shouId try some.


570
0:55:35,72 --> 0:55:48,52
She's here.


571
0:55:48,52 --> 0:55:50,12
Hey.


572
0:55:50,12 --> 0:55:52,44
Your friend NikoIai...


573
0:55:52,44 --> 0:55:55,92
...where is he?


574
0:55:55,92 --> 0:55:58,48
Where'd he go, VasiIy?


575
0:55:58,48 --> 0:56:38,92
Sorry.


576
0:56:38,92 --> 0:56:42,56
-Now we've got him.
-Go.


577
0:56:42,56 --> 0:56:48,16
Excuse me.


578
0:56:48,16 --> 0:56:58,4
You're not going anywhere--


579
0:56:58,4 --> 0:57:0,8
Don't worry.


580
0:57:0,8 --> 0:57:33,44
Hang in there, kid.


581
0:57:33,44 --> 0:57:59,2
-Is it warm?
-As usuaI.


582
0:57:59,2 --> 0:58:1,16
Good evening.


583
0:58:1,16 --> 0:58:2,64
May I heIp you?


584
0:58:2,64 --> 0:58:6,56
WeII, I've been toId that you have
a rather spectacuIar estabIishment...


585
0:58:6,56 --> 0:58:11,16
...and I was wondering
if you couId show me around.


586
0:58:11,16 --> 0:58:15,8
The structure itseIf dates back
to the time of King StanisIav.


587
0:58:15,8 --> 0:58:16,24
ReaIIy?


588
0:58:16,24 --> 0:58:19,48
He was the Iover
of Catherine the Great.


589
0:58:19,48 --> 0:58:22,36
They used to meet here in secret.


590
0:58:22,36 --> 0:58:28,2
The waIIs have hidden passages for
those who may need a discreet exit.


591
0:58:28,2 --> 0:58:32,32
We pride ourseIves on discretion.


592
0:58:32,32 --> 0:58:34,56
It's a beautifuI room.


593
0:58:34,56 --> 0:58:37,36
Listen, you know the young Iady
that I saw earIier...


594
0:58:37,36 --> 0:58:39,44
...with the hair combed straight back?


595
0:58:39,44 --> 0:58:42,8
Do you think I couId spend
some time with her?


596
0:58:42,8 --> 0:58:44,48
Smart choice.


597
0:58:44,48 --> 0:59:14,8
-I' II send her in.
-Thank you so much.


598
0:59:14,8 --> 0:59:16,8
-You speak EngIish?
-Yes.


599
0:59:16,8 --> 0:59:19,92
-Where are you from?
-I'm from Turkey.


600
0:59:19,92 --> 0:59:21,48
Listen.


601
0:59:21,48 --> 0:59:24,4
I know that you're used to one thing
or another...


602
0:59:24,4 --> 0:59:43,24
...but we'II do something different.


603
0:59:43,24 --> 0:59:45,52
He's probabIy checked
out of the hoteI.


604
0:59:45,52 --> 0:59:56,0
I wouIdn't even know
where to Iook for him.


605
0:59:56,0 --> 1:0:6,44
Okay.


606
1:0:6,44 --> 1:0:8,2
-Coffee, sir?
-Thank you.


607
1:0:8,2 --> 1:0:10,8
Who's that Iady?


608
1:0:10,8 --> 1:0:12,32
She is a Iady of the night.


609
1:0:12,32 --> 1:0:14,72
-Do you know her?
-Yes.


610
1:0:14,72 --> 1:0:45,0
Be my guest.


611
1:0:45,0 --> 1:0:47,16
Sorry about your head.
I didn't mean to do that.


612
1:0:47,16 --> 1:0:49,2
I just need five minutes
of your time.


613
1:0:49,2 --> 1:0:51,44
If I'm not back soon,
they'II Iook for me.


614
1:0:51,44 --> 1:0:55,12
I'II get to the point. This is a simpIe
exchange of information.


615
1:0:55,12 --> 1:0:57,4
TeII me what I need to know...


616
1:0:57,4 --> 1:1:0,4
...and then I need you to teII FaisaI
what I want him to think.


617
1:1:0,4 --> 1:1:1,76
What do you want?


618
1:1:1,76 --> 1:1:5,68
I'm gonna give you $1 0,000 cash.


619
1:1:5,68 --> 1:1:7,36
Why shouId I trust you?


620
1:1:7,36 --> 1:1:10,8
You don't reaIIy have
much of a choice.


621
1:1:10,8 --> 1:1:12,16
Then after you've done
what I asked...


622
1:1:12,16 --> 1:1:16,12
...I'II give you another 1 0,000, cash,
just because I Iike you so much.


623
1:1:16,12 --> 1:1:21,4
-You said five minutes of my time?
-That's about aII it'II take.


624
1:1:21,4 --> 1:1:23,2
Okay. What do you need?


625
1:1:23,2 --> 1:1:26,16
Is this the Oasis HoteI?
This is Dr. Graham.


626
1:1:26,16 --> 1:1:30,4
Have my wife and son
checked out yet?


627
1:1:30,4 --> 1:1:44,4
A message?


628
1:1:44,4 --> 1:1:50,6
Inside. QuickIy.


629
1:1:50,6 --> 1:1:54,72
What are you doing here? I toId you
not to stop. I toId you to keep going.


630
1:1:54,72 --> 1:1:59,36
He wouIdn't Iet me Ieave you.


631
1:1:59,36 --> 1:2:3,24
-It's not safe for you here.
-It's not safe out there either.


632
1:2:3,24 --> 1:2:5,44
You're gonna need
some reaI firepower...


633
1:2:5,44 --> 1:2:9,52
...and I know where to get it.


634
1:2:9,52 --> 1:2:15,12
-Who's gonna Iook after the boy?
-I can Iook after him.


635
1:2:15,12 --> 1:2:17,92
We won't be gone Iong.


636
1:2:17,92 --> 1:2:30,92
Are you gonna be aII right?


637
1:2:30,92 --> 1:2:34,4
-As soon as the car Ieaves--
-I know what to do. Good Iuck.


638
1:2:34,4 --> 1:2:38,0
Thank you.


639
1:2:38,0 --> 1:2:51,8
Be safe.


640
1:2:51,8 --> 1:2:54,4
What happened to you?


641
1:2:54,4 --> 1:2:56,16
The American.


642
1:2:56,16 --> 1:2:59,32
-He sent a hooker to Iure me away.
-You see him?


643
1:2:59,32 --> 1:3:4,32
I know where he is, or shouId I say,
where he is gonna be.


644
1:3:4,32 --> 1:3:6,12
How?


645
1:3:6,12 --> 1:3:11,12
I beat it out the fiIthy bitch.
She fought back, but....


646
1:3:11,12 --> 1:3:14,56
The restaurant owner
verifies your man's story.


647
1:3:14,56 --> 1:3:17,12
We shouId at Ieast
check the pIace out, coIoneI.


648
1:3:17,12 --> 1:3:19,96
WeII, if this is aII true, Ibo...


649
1:3:19,96 --> 1:3:24,44
...teII me, why do you Iook so guiIty?


650
1:3:24,44 --> 1:3:31,96
I didn't mean to hit her so hard, but....


651
1:3:31,96 --> 1:3:36,96
You kiIIed her?


652
1:3:36,96 --> 1:3:40,56
I'm impressed, Ibo.


653
1:3:40,56 --> 1:3:46,8
Now she can't teII the American
that we're onto him.


654
1:3:46,8 --> 1:3:49,28
How many men can you give me?


655
1:3:49,28 --> 1:3:55,4
Five shouId be enough.
Take care of it, Azimi.


656
1:3:55,4 --> 1:3:59,92
I'd Iike to get cIeaned up, coIoneI.


657
1:3:59,92 --> 1:4:8,16
Be quick.


658
1:4:8,16 --> 1:4:10,56
You got what I asked for?


659
1:4:10,56 --> 1:4:14,6
ExceIIent. BeneIIi Super 90.
ExactIy what the doctor ordered.


660
1:4:14,6 --> 1:4:32,4
You're gonna be aII right?


661
1:4:32,4 --> 1:4:34,84
So, what's the pIan?


662
1:4:34,84 --> 1:4:38,76
Ibo says that Irena wiII probabIy be
in FaisaI's room aII the time.


663
1:4:38,76 --> 1:4:40,96
-His room?
-I know how that sounds.


664
1:4:40,96 --> 1:4:43,36
We're just gonna have to hope
for the best.


665
1:4:43,36 --> 1:4:45,96
Any reason you chose
a pIace Iike this?


666
1:4:45,96 --> 1:4:50,96
This is a nice pIace, and there
is a method to my madness.


667
1:4:50,96 --> 1:4:54,8
And this is a part of my method.
This is a secret passageway...


668
1:4:54,8 --> 1:5:3,68
...courtesy of King StanisIav.


669
1:5:3,68 --> 1:5:6,8
Were you ever married, WiIIiam?


670
1:5:6,8 --> 1:5:11,0
Oh, you're forever the detective,
aren't you?


671
1:5:11,0 --> 1:5:13,88
You stiII haven't toId me why.


672
1:5:13,88 --> 1:5:17,2
Why aII of this for a girI
you've never even met?


673
1:5:17,2 --> 1:5:20,24
You know, some of us have done
bad things in the past.


674
1:5:20,24 --> 1:5:22,68
And once in a whiIe,
we find something...


675
1:5:22,68 --> 1:5:26,24
...that makes us feeI better
about ourseIves.


676
1:5:26,24 --> 1:5:53,92
This IittIe girI means a Iot to me.


677
1:5:53,92 --> 1:5:56,64
Take them out.


678
1:5:56,64 --> 1:5:58,96
Good evening. May I heIp you?


679
1:5:58,96 --> 1:6:3,36
The American. Where's he at?


680
1:6:3,36 --> 1:6:5,72
The door at the end.
The Japanese room.


681
1:6:5,72 --> 1:6:8,96
-Anybody eIse down there?
-No.


682
1:6:8,96 --> 1:7:18,8
Okay. Out. Now.


683
1:7:18,8 --> 1:8:39,68
Shit.


684
1:8:39,68 --> 1:8:45,4
-You okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.


685
1:8:45,4 --> 1:8:49,12
Sounds Iike your friend's down,
BiIIy Ray.


686
1:8:49,12 --> 1:8:51,4
It's down to the wire, BiIIy.


687
1:8:51,4 --> 1:8:55,64
Like the oId saying goes,
good guys finish Iast.


688
1:8:55,64 --> 1:8:58,8
You've gone soft.


689
1:8:58,8 --> 1:9:1,76
Look where that got you tonight.
Huh, BiIIy Ray?


690
1:9:1,76 --> 1:9:5,44
Lewis, you're pIaying a whore's game.


691
1:9:5,44 --> 1:9:7,16
You ain't nothing but a whore.


692
1:9:7,16 --> 1:9:9,36
And you know
what happens to whores.


693
1:9:9,36 --> 1:9:12,8
-What?
-Whores aIways get fucked, don't they?


694
1:9:12,8 --> 1:9:18,36
You gonna fuck me, huh?


695
1:9:18,36 --> 1:9:20,72
Hey, BiIIy...


696
1:9:20,72 --> 1:9:26,6
-...I'm out.
-Ain't that a coincidence? I'm out too.


697
1:9:26,6 --> 1:9:28,36
You see?


698
1:9:28,36 --> 1:9:31,84
So how do you want to pIay this?


699
1:9:31,84 --> 1:9:33,92
Hey, BiIIy, it's your caII, man.


700
1:9:33,92 --> 1:9:39,56
Look, just Iike oId times.
Just me and you.


701
1:9:39,56 --> 1:9:53,8
-Hey, I was just kidding.
-I was just kidding too.


702
1:9:53,8 --> 1:9:55,96
You okay?


703
1:9:55,96 --> 1:9:59,24
-Go get the girI.
-You sure?


704
1:9:59,24 --> 1:10:9,72
Yeah.


705
1:10:9,72 --> 1:10:12,76
Stand up.


706
1:10:12,76 --> 1:10:19,76
Get up!


707
1:10:19,76 --> 1:10:37,88
We're gonna take
a IittIe journey together.


708
1:10:37,88 --> 1:10:39,68
It's my favourite moment in Iife.


709
1:10:39,68 --> 1:10:43,8
-What's that?
-When the predator becomes the prey.


710
1:10:43,8 --> 1:10:46,96
AIso my favourite moment,
but it remains to be seen...


711
1:10:46,96 --> 1:10:57,28
...who's the predator
and who's the prey.


712
1:10:57,28 --> 1:10:59,68
It's okay. Don't be afraid.


713
1:10:59,68 --> 1:11:3,12
-Who are you?
-You knew I'd come for you.


714
1:11:3,12 --> 1:11:8,28
You know, with these guns, I can't
reaIIy kiII you sIowIy, and I'd Iike to.


715
1:11:8,28 --> 1:11:10,84
-What? In front of the chiId?
-ExactIy.


716
1:11:10,84 --> 1:11:14,48
So why don't we settIe this Iike men,
outside, without the guns?


717
1:11:14,48 --> 1:11:16,84
Sure.


718
1:11:16,84 --> 1:11:19,16
This won't take Iong.


719
1:11:19,16 --> 1:11:21,6
You're right about that.


720
1:11:21,6 --> 1:11:24,24
I despise taking human Iife.


721
1:11:24,24 --> 1:11:27,2
I'm kind of embarrassed
to admit the fact...


722
1:11:27,2 --> 1:11:33,6
...that I'm gonna enjoy
kiIIing you sIowIy.


723
1:11:33,6 --> 1:16:8,56
My sentiments exactIy.


724
1:16:8,56 --> 1:16:13,84
Dear Kasia, Nikki and I are
finally safe and well in America.


725
1:16:13,84 --> 1:16:18,56
William sends his regards and thanks.
William doesn't say very much.


726
1:16:18,56 --> 1:16:21,52
As you know, he's not one for words.


727
1:16:21,52 --> 1:16:23,88
He spends most of his time
by himself...


728
1:16:23,88 --> 1:16:26,76
... wandering the forest
looking for injured animals.


729
1:16:26,76 --> 1:16:28,84
He seems to lik e it that way.


730
1:16:28,84 --> 1:16:31,92
At least now, though,
he'll never be alone.


731
1:16:31,92 --> 1:16:53,2
All our love, Irena and Nikki.


732
1:16:53,2 --> 1:18:53,2
-Where do you think he's fIying?
-Maybe he has a famiIy too.
