###18 MITT ROMNEY: My dad had been born in Mexico and his family
###21 had to leave during the Mexican Revolution.
###23 He had big dreams.
###25 We were Mormons and growing up in Michigan, that might have
###28 seemed unusual or out of place, but I really don't
###31 remember it that way.
###33 My friends cared more about what sports teams we followed
###35 than what church we went to.
###37 
###42 SHANE SMITH: So we're on our way down here to Colonial
###44 Juarez, which is in Northern Mexico in Chihuahua state.
###47 A lot of people may know that Romney and his family are
###51 actually from here.
###52 His father was actually born here in a Mormon colony.
###55 But maybe what they don't know is that these Mormon colonies
###57 are still here.
###59 And they're actually fighting the narco cartels, the drug
###62 cartels, that run this whole region.
###64 They're standing up and they're fighting the
###65 kidnapping and the violence and the crime.
###68 So the question is, what are the Mormons doing down in
###71 Mexico in the first place?
###75 Mormons originally came down to Mexico in the late 1800s
###79 after the American government forced the Mormon church to
###81 ban polygamy.
###83 The problem with this is that Joseph Smith, the prophet of
###86 the religion, held that polygamy was actually a divine
###89 commandment.
###90 He believed that you could only reach the highest level
###93 of the celestial kingdom, or heaven, if you are actually a
###96 partner in a plural marriage.
###98 So basically, the more wives you had, the better
###100 heaven would be.
###101 And rather than give up their place in heaven, many moved
###104 down to Mexico to continue to practice polygamy, and thereby
###107 assure their place in the afterlife.
###110 Here in the seclusion of the Mexican desert, they could
###113 practice all the standard Mormon rituals, like baptizing
###116 the dead or wearing magic underwear, but also the more
###119 controversial plural marriage.
###121 Or, as we were soon to find out, the outright insane
###124 practice of blood atonement.
###126 So after about five hours of some very nervous driving and
###130 a couple of very thorough stops at military checkpoints,
###133 not to mention two stops at drive-through liquor stores to
###135 calm our very jangly nerves, we finally arrived at the
###139 Mormon promised land.
###140 
###146 We left Juarez, which is very dirty and
###149 poor and very druggie.
###151 And then all of a sudden you come over this hill, and
###153 there's orchards and golf courses.
###155 The streets are laid out nice, they've got nice schools, kids
###157 are playing baseball, and there's angels.
###159 And it's kind of like ah, we've come to God's country.
###163 Because it's beautiful here and they obviously have money.
###166 So this is why they're being targeted by the narcos, and
###168 this is why they have to fight back.
###169 So now we're going to go meet some Mormons who are actually
###172 fighting the narco cartel.
###173 
###179 This is Brent LeBaron's farm.
###181 They are sort of famously secretive about their weapons,
###184 their fighting, because they don't want to be targeted
###186 anymore by the cartels.
###188 We're going to go meet him and see if he'll show us around.
###190 
###193 Brent?
###193 BRENT LEBARON: Yeah, how's it going?
###194 SHANE SMITH: Shane Smith.
###195 BRENT LEBARON: Brent LeBaron.
###196 Nice to meet you.
###196 SHANE SMITH: Nice to meet you, how you doing?
###197 BRENT LEBARON: I'm very, very well.
###198 SHANE SMITH: This is your farm?
###199 BRENT LEBARON: This is my farm.
###200 We farm chili and a little bit of wheat-- all depends on the
###204 time of the season.
###205 SHANE SMITH: We've heard that the LeBaron family, the
###208 LeBaron colony, has sort of been standing up to some of
###211 the narco cartels.
###212 BRENT LEBARON: Yeah, we've had a few run-ins with them.
###216 I don't like to say too much about them.
###219 But I'd love to show you around.
###221 Let's go.
###222 SHANE SMITH: Let's do it.
###223 Now, I didn't know what to expect when I first met Brent.
###225 And when I did, he seemed to me more
###227 American than most Americans.
###228 In fact, I wouldn't have been surprised if he told me he
###230 played linebacker for Alabama.
###232 But when he started to give me the tour around the cemetery,
###235 I realized that his story was anything but normal.
###238 BRENT LEBARON: This is a graveyard where my grandfather
###241 and great grandfather are buried.
###244 The original story is they come down for the cause of
###247 plural marriage to continue it--
###250 Mexico allowed it.
###250 SHANE SMITH: So they wanted to continue polygamy?
###252 BRENT LEBARON: Yes.
###253 My great grandfather, being a fundamentalist, he broke away
###256 from the Mormon church because he had two wives.
###259 That's when he went to establish Colonial LeBaron.
###261 They established five or six colonies down here.
###265 SHANE SMITH: The colony would be like a family?
###266 BRENT LEBARON: A few families.
###268 SHANE SMITH: And then your grandfather had 10 wives.
###271 BRENT LEBARON: Yes.
###271 Had children by eight of those 10.
###273 SHANE SMITH: And how many grand kids did he have?
###275 BRENT LEBARON: Between grandkids and great grandkids,
###277 they're probably pushing the 400 mark right now.
###280 SHANE SMITH: Wow.
###280 All named LeBaron.
###281 BRENT LEBARON: All named LeBaron.
###282 SHANE SMITH: Now, having more than 400 grandchildren might
###285 seem extreme to some, but it's nothing compared to the shit
###289 that Brent's Uncle Ervil got up to.
###291 He was a straight up fucking lunatic.
###296 Now Ervil not only had 13 wives and over 50 children,
###300 but he also used his own family, including his own
###302 kids, as assassins.
###305 Dubbed "The Mormon Manson," Ervil and his family were
###308 suspects in over 40 murders.
###311 Joel LeBaron was killed by his own brother Ervil because of
###314 blood atonement?
###314 BRENT LEBARON: Yes.
###316 Well, Ervil tried to take over the Church and he started
###318 claiming blood atonement, the right to kill
###321 in the name of God.
###322 If you oppose him, he has the right to kill you.
###325 Once Ervil snapped, he just went on a killing spree.
###328 He had his daughters killed, his wives killed, his sons
###332 killed and it just went from there.
###334 He went haywire.
###335 SHANE SMITH: So Ervil goes on this killing spree across
###338 Mexico and the United States.
###340 And at one point the Secret Service is after him because
###343 he threatens to kill President Carter.
###345 They finally captured Ervil in 1979 and sent him to prison,
###349 and all the killing stops, right?
###351 Wrong.
###352 And then after he dies in jail, people keep
###355 on killing for him.
###355 He killed up to 25 people after he died because he left
###359 a sort of hit list, and they just kept killing.
###361 BRENT LEBARON: They kept killing.
###362 Yes, they did.
###363 SHANE SMITH: Now as Brent is telling me all this, I had to
###365 keep in mind that this blood atonement killing spree isn't
###368 taking place in the 1880s or anything, this is all
###371 happening in the 1980s.
###373 BRENT LEBARON: My grandfather ran from him
###375 for probably 10 years.
###376 SHANE SMITH: Wow.
###376 BRENT LEBARON: I mean, he chased my
###377 grandpa clear to Nicaragua.
###379 SHANE SMITH: Your great uncle was trying to kill your
###382 grandfather?
###382 BRENT LEBARON: Yeah.
###383 Verlan M. LeBaron died in a car accident right out of
###386 Mexico City.
###387 A lot of people have been skeptical that actually Ervil
###390 had something to do with it.
###391 And his last recorded words were "Brother, it looks like
###396 you've been ran off the road."
###398 SHANE SMITH: That's some crazy shit.
###399 BRENT LEBARON: Yeah.
###400 That's just a modern-day Cain and Abel here.
###404 SHANE SMITH: Do you think that that's one of the reasons why,
###406 because you had this sort of familial civil war, you got
###409 tighter as a family?
###410 So when the narcos came after your family you
###412 were sort of tougher?
###413 BRENT LEBARON: Well, definitely
###415 everyone was a watchman.
###417 SHANE SMITH: Now what he's saying here is that because of
###419 Ervil, everyone in the LeBaron clan watched out
###423 for everyone else.
###424 So when the cartels kidnapped one of their
###426 own, they were ready.
###428 Eric LeBaron was only 16 when he was abducted and held for
###433 $1 million ransom.
###435 And you didn't pay the ransom?
###436 BRENT LEBARON: We didn't pay the ransom.
###437 SHANE SMITH: Even if you could get the money and paid it,
###439 they're just going to keep doing it.
###440 BRENT LEBARON: Just going to keep coming and keep doing it.
###442 SHANE SMITH: They'll just use the money to buy more guns and
###444 get more powerful.
###445 BRENT LEBARON: Exactly.
###446 If we don't sever the head off this monster right now, it's
###449 just going to get worse.
###451 We had to go to the government and say hey, you won't allow
###454 us to bear arms, but you're supposed to protect us.
###457 SHANE SMITH: The protest forced the government to put
###460 pressure on the kidnappers.
###461 And as is quite rare in these situations, Eric was returned
###464 unharmed after paying no ransom.
###467 However, it also served to enrage the local drug lord
###471 named El Rikin, who only lived eight miles down the road from
###474 Colonial LeBaron.
###475 Now, this is a narco who loves drugs so much that he actually
###479 massacred 18 people trying to get off the stuff at a drug
###482 rehab center.
###484 And now he's after the LeBarons.
###486 
###493 BRENT LEBARON: They had threatened his family with a
###495 hand grenade.
###496 SHANE SMITH: So they said they'd blow up the family with
###497 the grenade unless he surrendered.
###499 BRENT LEBARON: Unless he opened the door.
###501 MALE SPEAKER: They shot them four times in the head each.
###503 10 children under the age of seven were left orphans when
###506 that happened.
