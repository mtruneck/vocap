1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,39



2
0:0:0,39 --> 0:0:4,7
Look upon my works ye
mighty, and despair.


3
0:0:4,7 --> 0:0:7,9
I was recently described as
a ubiquitous know-it-all.


4
0:0:7,9 --> 0:0:8,94
I'm an author and journalist.


5
0:0:8,94 --> 0:0:11,31
In the past, I was responsible
for making London's Design


6
0:0:11,31 --> 0:0:13,65
Museum and was briefly,
hilariously, and


7
0:0:13,65 --> 0:0:16,35
catastrophically, the
creative director of


8
0:0:16,35 --> 0:0:17,76
the Millennium Dome.


9
0:0:17,76 --> 0:0:21,73
What's deplorable about the
Olympic merchandise, it


10
0:0:21,73 --> 0:0:24,4
assumes a very low level of


11
0:0:24,4 --> 0:0:26,16
intelligence amongst the public.


12
0:0:26,16 --> 0:0:29,98
How is the person who consumes
this bit of tat going to be


13
0:0:29,98 --> 0:0:32,22
changed or enhanced by
possession of it?


14
0:0:32,22 --> 0:0:36,15
It's ugly, it's cynical,
and it's stupid.


15
0:0:36,15 --> 0:0:38,99
Several design principles
have been violated here.


16
0:0:38,99 --> 0:0:41,28
This is an ugly travesty.


17
0:0:41,28 --> 0:0:46,89
Mindless, stupid, cynical,
patronizing, exploitative,


18
0:0:46,89 --> 0:0:50,3
manipulative, ugly,
and useless.


19
0:0:50,3 --> 0:0:53,12
We want to revive our industry
and revive the credibility of


20
0:0:53,12 --> 0:0:57,76
our great nation by putting
something like this for sale?


21
0:0:57,76 --> 0:0:59,28
I mean what purpose is
this meant to serve?


22
0:0:59,28 --> 0:1:3,71
It's not a clever photograph,
and it shows this sort of


23
0:1:3,71 --> 0:1:8,56
laborious conceit of the
London Eye as a target.


24
0:1:8,56 --> 0:1:11,25
Given the ever-present threat
of terrorist activity, that


25
0:1:11,25 --> 0:1:15,47
seems to me to be an unfortunate
lapse of taste.


26
0:1:15,47 --> 0:1:17,36
But I think al-Qaeda
is probably too--


27
0:1:17,36 --> 0:1:19,69
I think their aesthetics are
too advanced to take much


28
0:1:19,69 --> 0:1:21,25
interest in this
sort of thing.


29
0:1:21,25 --> 0:1:23,456
Appalling.
