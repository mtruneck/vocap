NARRATOR: It's been a bloody
month in Afghanistan, and


3
0:0:14,99 --> 0:0:17,75
there was more bad news as the
Ministry of Defence announced


4
0:0:17,75 --> 0:0:20,75
the deaths of four more
British soldiers.


5
0:0:20,75 --> 0:0:23,67
18 British soldiers' lives have
been taken this month,


6
0:0:23,67 --> 0:0:26,62
bringing the total to 307.


7
0:0:26,62 --> 0:0:28,95
The news comes on the day that
three more troops were


8
0:0:28,95 --> 0:0:31,63
repatriated to the town
of Wootton Bassett.


9
0:0:31,63 --> 0:0:34,18
The announcement of yet more
deaths has caused the local


10
0:0:34,18 --> 0:0:37,13
population to question how many
more people will have to


11
0:0:37,13 --> 0:0:40,3
sacrifice their lives before
the conflict ends.


12
0:0:40,3 --> 0:0:53,95

LAWRENCE BEDFORD: You're
now in Paghman village.


14
0:0:57,57 --> 0:1:0,57
Beyond Paghman village, you've
got the patrol base Mektila,


15
0:1:0,57 --> 0:1:2,65
where the company's
operating from.


16
0:1:2,65 --> 0:1:5,3
They've got a platoon forward
in Paghman which has taken


17
0:1:5,3 --> 0:1:6,8
over the ANP station.


18
0:1:6,8 --> 0:1:9,68
And there's now going to be a
shura, which is going to take


19
0:1:9,68 --> 0:1:13,63
place at about 09:00, about 30
minutes time, where the OC


20
0:1:13,63 --> 0:1:17,6
will come down, have a meeting
with the local elder here,


21
0:1:17,6 --> 0:1:19,15
just to see how he can
improve the situation


22
0:1:19,15 --> 0:1:20,4

NICK COPPERWAITE: Shakar does
not have enough soldiers to


25
0:1:29,72 --> 0:1:30,96
protect the village.


26
0:1:30,96 --> 0:1:33,7
So if we work with Shakar, I
will put soldiers in the


27
0:1:33,7 --> 0:1:36,4
village because they will give
you greater protection.


28
0:1:36,4 --> 0:1:39,16
When they're no longer required,
we will move back


29
0:1:39,16 --> 0:1:42,7
across to our base, and
leave Shakar here.


30
0:1:42,7 --> 0:1:45,83
But we will do that in
discussion between the Malik,

We're just heading up to,

location is, which is
called Fort Mektila.


74
0:3:40,54 --> 0:3:44,81
Because they've changed this
area quite recently because of


75
0:3:44,81 --> 0:3:45,96
the way that we've altered
our training.


76
0:3:45,96 --> 0:3:48,75
STANTA always used to be where
it was set up for Northern


77
0:3:48,75 --> 0:3:49,35

78
0:3:49,35 --> 0:3:53,62

290
0:14:30,27 --> 0:14:32,48

296

Because we're--


297
0:14:48,39 --> 0:14:50,166
it's just to injure.


298
0:14:50,166 --> 0:14:52,46

want to just injure

302
0:14:58,13 --> 0:14:59,52
but yours are only
trying to injure.


303
0:14:59,52 --> 0:15:3,503

a bigger caliber bullet.


304

feel about that?

know, really.

It doesn't seem fair, does
it, to be honest?

If I could get away with
injuring someone and not


308
0:15:15,62 --> 0:15:18,71

that'd probably be better.

off the helmet, I got

see no blood or

382

And then suddenly, I saw a
gushing of blood just flow

down my head, hitting the
floor and [INAUDIBLE]

lost the use of my legs.

that kept me going.

go through here.

It cut the artery.


396
0:18:39,38 --> 0:18:40,48
That's where all the
blood came from.


397
0:18:40,48 --> 0:18:44,84
I didn't know the extent of that
until a few months later.


398
0:18:44,84 --> 0:18:49,825
Because the blast was so close,
it shook the brain side


399
0:18:49,825 --> 0:18:51,89
to side, and it killed all the
brain cells around the


400
0:18:51,89 --> 0:18:55,21
outside, which give me
signal problems.


401
0:18:55,21 --> 0:18:58,305
So that's why I couldn't use
certain muscles, and it was


402
0:18:58,305 --> 0:18:59,49
tough to start walking.


403
0:18:59,49 --> 0:19:0,26
Couldn't lift my arm up.


404
0:19:0,26 --> 0:19:1,73
Couldn't speak properly.


405
0:19:1,73 --> 0:19:3,181
Couldn't use my tongue.

0:19:18,47 --> 0:19:19,29

I couldn't [INAUDIBLE].


411
0:19:20,54 --> 0:19:23,5



412
0:19:23,5 --> 0:19:25,35
They told me I probably
wouldn't walk.


413
0:19:25,35 --> 0:19:28,3
They told me I probably
wouldn't do nothing.


414
0:19:28,3 --> 0:19:29,81
But I managed to get--


415
0:19:29,81 --> 0:19:33,7
INTERVIEWER: How old were you
when they told you that?


416
0:19:33,7 --> 0:19:34,5
RICHARD DARE: 22.


417
0:19:34,5 --> 0:19:36,42
I mean it was only 5 days
after my birthday.


418
0:19:36,42 --> 0:19:58,6
So yeah, 22.


419
0:19:58,6 --> 0:20:2,42
MARION YOUNG: RAF Lyneham is
only a town away from us.


420
0:20:2,42 --> 0:20:3,64
What happens is, the bodies get


421
0:20:3,64 --> 0:20:6,39
repatriated to RAF Lyneham.


422
0:20:6,39 --> 0:20:9,29
We're the first town on
the way to Oxford.


423
0:20:9,29 --> 0:20:12,41
So the repat bodies come through
Wootton Bassett.


424
0:20:12,41 --> 0:20:16,68
And then people line the streets
to pay their respects


425
0:20:16,68 --> 0:20:17,72
on the day.


426
0:20:17,72 --> 0:20:21,16
Well, I've got three grown-up
sons and none of them in the


427
0:20:21,16 --> 0:20:22,74
armed forces.


428
0:20:22,74 --> 0:20:24,68
I know it sounds a horrible
thing to say, but I'm glad


429
0:20:24,68 --> 0:20:27,17
because they would be
out in that war now.


430
0:20:27,17 --> 0:20:30,3
That's one of the reasons I
started standing out there, is


431
0:20:30,3 --> 0:20:33,37
because I knew that in them
coffins was someone's son or


432
0:20:33,37 --> 0:20:37,24
daughter, husband, boyfriend.


433
0:20:37,24 --> 0:20:38,477
And I just wanted to
do something to


434
0:20:38,477 --> 0:20:40,82
say that I do care.


435
0:20:40,82 --> 0:20:43,54
But equally I care about all
the people that's been lost


436
0:20:43,54 --> 0:20:46,28
their lives in Afghanistan as
well-- the Muslims as well.


437
0:20:46,28 --> 0:20:49,54
So, I mean, I just don't
feel for our soldiers.


438
0:20:49,54 --> 0:20:53,707

move to HLS and send it again.

in a restaurant,

and I started panicking.

And I didn't know what to do.

me, but I could


505
0:23:46,6 --> 0:23:48,65
see Afghan on top.


506
0:23:48,65 --> 0:23:52,34

walking around normally, just


507

enjoying the fireworks
and that.


508
0:23:53,85 --> 0:23:57,38

to eat my steak.

around him fighting.

to get out and fight.

to shout stuff.

0:24:9,32 --> 0:24:10,26
I hold it back.


517
0:24:10,26 --> 0:24:14,16
And every time I'm holding it
back, it kicks off other


518
0:24:14,16 --> 0:24:15,97
things, and emotions,
and go up and down.


519
0:24:15,97 --> 0:24:18,83
And just holding the head,
and I didn't know what


520
0:24:18,83 --> 0:24:21,71
to do in the end.


521
0:24:21,71 --> 0:24:24,57

than two minutes.

I was just going for it.


523
0:24:26,4 --> 0:24:28,17

or I just would've


524
0:24:28,17 --> 0:24:29,26
poured my eyes out.

0:24:29,26 --> 0:24:31,85

everything I did out there.
