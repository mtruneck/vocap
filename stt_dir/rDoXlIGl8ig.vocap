###0 how lucky they are.
###14 Because the settlers also bring bees with them for their honey.
###21 The native American bee pollinates only a few species,
###25 but European honey bees can live almost everywhere and pollinate any plant in sight.
###43 Gardens turn into plantations
###48 for consumption at home and abroad.
###54 Apples thrive
###55 and become a major industry in North America,
###60 eventually yielding a harvest of five million tons a year,
###65 all beginning
###67 with European seedlings.
###76 This is biological imperialism in full swing.
###87 Europe's fruits
###88 and vegetables conquer the new world.
###114 But it is also an exchange.
###117 It is of the Columbian Exchange.
###120 European kitchens may not see native meat from America, bison or lama,
###126 but new world vegetables make a big impact.
###140 The plant with the greatest impact on Europe needs a couple of centuries to
###144 take root in its culture.
###157 "This tuber is insipid and mealy and cannot be classed among the agreeable
###162 foodstuffs but it's furnishes abundant and rather wholesome nutrition to men
###168 who are content to be nourished.
###171 It is justly regarded as flatulent but what are winds to the vigorous organs of
###177 peasants and labourers?"
###180 wrote Diderot in his Encyclopedia in the eighteenth century.
###200 Introduced into Spain
###201 potatoes slowly spread to Italy and to northern and eastern Europe.
###207 By sixteen hundred the potatoes enter Austria, Holland, France, Switzerland,
###212 England and Germany.
###214 Frederick the Great himself urges its cultivation in Prussia.
###220 But it is the Irish who adopt the potato with open arms.
###224 They have a limited food supply and grain grown here has often been
###228 destroyed or burned as the result of war.
###234 But the potato safely under ground
###237 survives these hardships.
###240 In one hundred years Irish population
###243 more than doubles.
###252 And towns like Berlin grow into great cities.
###257 By 1700
###259 there is an unprecedented population explosion in Europe,
###264 thanks to a plant from the faraway Andes.
###277 Only one domestic animal from the new world sets foot in Europe:
###284 the turkey.
###289 Turkey and a few vegetables enhance the European diet, but otherwise
###294 their life is relatively unchanged.
###297 So why was the Columbian Exchange so one-sided?
###299 Why did it go primarily in one direction from Europe to America?
###303 With the exception of things like potatoes and potato blight,
###307 why was Europe not overtaken by American plants and animals?
###311 It's difficult to say why something did not happen,
###314 but you have to remember that
###316 the ecological invasion was a cooperative enterprise,
###318 disease and plants and animals working together
###321 and Europe remained densely-populated and didn't have diseases depopulate its people
###326 and so you didn't have niches open up for livestock to graze
###331 and then weeds to take over the areas that livestock had overgrazed and trampled,
###335 so that that critical part it worked in one direction primarily.
###347 The European elites want more than just turkeys and potatoes from the new world,
###351 they want luxury products.
###361 Sugar and tobacco,
###362 meet the requirements of the upper class.
###382 The first British settlers quickly acquire a taste for American tobacco
###387 and export large shipments to Europe.
###396 To satisfy such high demand
###398 settlers build immense plantations.
###408 Growing sugar becomes a business on the same scale as tobacco.
###413 The new model cultures cover entire landscapes.
###421 For this sole purpose some ten million Africans are transported to America
###428 and enslaved to cultivate luxury items for Americans and Europeans.
###438 Because of the rapid depopulation of the Americas owing to disease,
###441 Europeans faced a shortage of labour in their effort to exploit
###444 the resources of the new world particularly to exploit the soil,
###447 so the Europeans, first the Portuguese and then the Dutch and then eventually the English
###452 imported slaves from west Africa to cultivate sugar in the Caribbean and Brazil,
###457 tobacco in Virginia, rice in South Carolina and by the nineteenth century
###460 in mainland North America,
###462 it's no exaggeration to say that
###465 these cash commodities
###466 produced by slave labour were central to the export economies of the Americas.
###472 By the eighteenth century the metamorphosis of much of America is complete.
###484 New Spain and New England are fully established.
###489 Nature has been transformed
###492 and is in the hands of man.
###507 Now pioneers are heading west.
###515 There is still empty land in that direction.
###524 They will complete what was begun
###527 in the east.
###536 In the creation of the new world
###538 perhaps ninety percent of the native American people died.
###543 The people who took their place
###545 came from all over Europe,
###548 as conquistadors,
###550 settlers,
###553 explorers,
###556 and colonists.
###562 And they came from Africa as slaves.
###569 But it was the transfer of animals and plants from Europe to the Americas
###574 that really made the creation of the new world possible.
###593 In today's chrome and steel cities
###596 we sometimes seem so cut off from Nature
###599 that it may be difficult to believe the Columbian Exchange ever happened.
###604 But in the final analysis the skyscrapers
###607 and the melting pot of the races
###611 owe their existence not only to humans
###614 but also to the natural world.
###621 People came to the Americas for many reasons. Some came to make money,
###624 some came for religious freedom, some came involuntarily as slaves
###628 but those populations took hold
###630 in the Americas because of the accident of ecology,
###633 because of the microbes, the plants, the animals that they brought with them gave them
###637 an advantage over the people who were already here.
###639 And the legacy
###640 of the Columbian Exchange is also still largely biological,
###645 and that legacy will continue into the future.
###653 It all  began five hundred years ago,
###657 Columbus
###658 had a vision
###661 and three ships set out in a quest for India
###667 and found the new world.
