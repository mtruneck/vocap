###1 TRAVIS: Now on "Rocket City Rednecks"...
###3 We answer the call to build a new kind of drone
###5 for the U.S. military.
###7 Don't try. Do it.
###8 But when a military expert comes to check it out...
###11 MAN: Rockets and guns, huh? TRAVIS: Rockets and guns.
###13 Will it be "Sweet Drone Alabama"?
###16 Oh!
###17 Or will our weaponized aircraft fail to make the grade?
###20 Oh, no! Oh, no! Crap!
###24 I'm Travis Taylor.
###26 I'm a rocket scientist in the space and defense industry
###28 here in my hometown of Huntsville, Alabama,
###31 where my daddy helped build the rockets
###32 that sent us to the moon.
###34 DADDY: Have y'all been drinking rocket fuel again?
###37 TRAVIS: Sometimes big science moves too slow for me,
###40 so come the weekend, I round up my best friend Rog,
###44 my nephew Michael, and my buddy Pete
###46 to tackle important problems
###48 with a little down-home ingenuity.
###50 ROG: Damn it, boy!
###55 TRAVIS: Right on.
###56 Hey, is there any more beers in the cooler?
###59 TRAVIS: The U.S. military's
###61 been taking out all kinds of enemy targets
###63 with the help of combat drones.
###65 And this weekend, we're going to join them
###67 in creating the next generation of drone technology--
###70 ones that don't cost millions of dollars to make.
###73 I told all the guys to bring anything
###75 that looks like it's a remote control vehicle,
###77 electronic airplanes, helicopters, whatever,
###79 lightweight construction material.
###81 PETE: We don't need this.
###82 ROG: Why we dragging all this crap out for?
###85 TRAVIS: What we're gonna do is we're gonna build a UAV drone.
###89 The American military is looking to make
###91 a small unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV,
###95 that can be carried by a single soldier out in the field.
###98 In fact, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
###102 or DARPA,
###103 has issued a challenge to citizen scientists
###105 to build a drone that can do three things.
###107 One, fly a couple miles.
###109 Two, send back video.
###111 And three, fit into a backpack
###113 so a single soldier can carry it.
###116 Let's say this soldier gets into trouble,
###119 so he pulls his UAV out of his backpack,
###120 tosses it up, it flies up over the trees
###122 and looks and finds where the bad guys are.
###124 They give him either an escape route or an attack route.
###127 MICHAEL: My dad's in the military.
###129 I'd love for him to have something like this.
###131 So this is a real important build to me,
###132 and I think I can contribute a lot to it.
###135 TRAVIS: People are used to drones
###136 that look and fly like airplanes,
###138 but I want ours to take off vertically,
###140 so we're gonna make a helicopter drone.
###144 We're gonna use remote-control helicopter motors for lift,
###147 and below them we'll mount a video camera.
###150 And even though DARPA
###152 isn't calling for their portable drones to have weapons,
###154 we're gonna add rockets and a gun
###157 that can be fired remotely.
###160 For our first test,
###161 we've already got a gun hooked up to a couple motors
###164 from a remote control helicopter.
###166 We're gonna see if it can get off the ground
###169 and if we can fire off of some rounds
###170 using this really cool firing system
###172 that Michael designed.
###175 When we push a joystick on the RC controller,
###178 a small motor, also known as a servo, will rotate,
###181 driving an armature into the trigger
###183 like a plastic finger...
###185 and bang!
###186 The enemy won't know what hit 'em.
###189 We're about to take it out in the backyard
###191 and see if we can fly this thing with two motors
###194 and fire this paintball gun with it.
###197 ROG: How cool is that?
###198 We just made ourselves a flying gun.
###201 I bet we can take that thing duck hunting.
###204 PETE: We loaded it up with plenty of ammo,
###206 and Mr. Taylor made us a nice target to shoot at.
###210 TRAVIS: Here we go, We're gonna bring the motors up.
###214 We're coming on up.
###215 Yeah, there we go. Are we getting any lift?
###217 You feel like it's pulling out of your hand?
###218 MICHAEL: It's pulling. Just not enough.
###220 TRAVIS: Careful with it now. All the way, all the way.
###223 Going full throttle.
###224 MICHAEL: Full throttle it. ROG: Stay with it.
###226 Michael: Is that wide open?
###228 TRAVIS: It's wide open. It ain't gonna lift it. Crap!
###230 Yeah, I thought it would have lifted it, man.
###232 PETE: Maybe those batteries--
###233 TRAVIS: That gun's just a lot heavier,
###235 and the paintballs added more weight.
###236 That's a lot of weight
###238 'cause that's all liquid in them paintballs.
###239 PETE: It's obvious we're gonna need more motors
###241 to lift all the payload on our weaponized drone.
###243 But before we work on that problem,
###245 we're gonna go ahead and see if our remote trigger works.
###247 MICHAEL: Gun's hot. TRAVIS: Alright, here we go.
###249 Gun's hot, ready to fire it in three, two, one.
###253 MICHAEL: When they hit that remote trigger
###255 on the controller,
###257 that plastic finger should rotate and fire the gun.
###262 TRAVIS: Crap!
###264 DADDY: Now, I like to see things go off
###266 when you pull the trigger.
###267 MICHAEL: You ain't got nothing. TRAVIS: Crap.
###269 DADDY: I'm just frustrated.
###270 The motors didn't work, and neither did the trigger.
###273 We got our work cut out for us on this one.
###275 TRAVIS: One complete motor...
###278 One of the things we learned from this test
###280 is we need to know exactly how much weight each motor can lift,
###284 because we want our drone to carry not just a gun,
###287 but a camera and a whole bunch of rockets.
###289 MICHAEL: What you think about that?
###291 DADDY: Hey, that's neat.
###292 MICHAEL: We didn't know how to measure
###293 how much weight the motor could lift,
###295 but then Papaw had an idea.
###297 DADDY: Why not just use my old fish scales?
###301 TRAVIS: Everybody get your safety glasses on.
###306 All right, so what we're gonna do with this
###308 is measure the lift of this engine, all right,
###312 by looking at the scale right there
###314 and see how much thrust we're getting out of it.
###315 Y'all be careful because the blades are sharp.
###318 They'll cut your finger off in a heartbeat.
###320 All right, here we go.
###324 [motor revs]
###328 TRAVIS: That's good. That's good.
###331 How much was that? MICHAEL: Five pounds.
###335 TRAVIS: So if one motor can lift five pounds,
###338 then four can lift twenty.
###339 That ought to be enough, so that's the plan.
###342 We're gonna build a four-propeller
###344 helicopter drone.
###346 We're gonna put our propellers on a frame,
###348 and we'll hang the camera and the weapons from that.
###352 I want to get this thing done today
###354 or first thing in the morning
###356 'cause a buddy of mine that's a UAV expert
###358 over at University of Alabama in Huntsville
###360 told me he'd come over here tomorrow about 2:00
###363 to see our solution.
###367 Dr. Brian Landrum has been working with the army
###369 and on UAVs for years.
###371 He's written dozens of scientific papers
###373 and analyzed UAV designs for the military.
###376 If we can impress him with our drone,
###378 I think we can get it seen by DARPA.
###380 ROG: He's got this guy coming over here tomorrow,
###382 and we've got tons of stuff to figure out.
###385 And I don't see how we can be half done by then.
###387 TRAVIS: You and Pete figure out why that gun didn't fire
###391 and figure out what we gotta do to do four motors at once.
###394 If we're gonna have four motors on this thing,
###396 then we're gonna need something to attach them to.
###398 So I sent Rog out to the hardware store
###400 to find us some kind of lightweight frame.
###407 ROG: Wait a minute now.
###413 ROG: When I was driving by, I saw at my buddy's house,
###418 his wife was out in the yard,
###419 and his little girl was doing the hula-hoop.
###421 And I got an idea.
###425 We ain't gonna have to build a frame.
###427 A hula-hoop's already made like that, you know.
###432 So I did a little bartering,
###434 and I traded my hat for the hula-hoop.
###436 And I think I got a pretty fair deal.
###438 PETE: I've got them ready.
###440 TRAVIS: That's all right. DADDY: Hold that thing up level.
###442 [horn honking]
###443 DADDY: Oh, man.
###446 TRAVIS: We sent Rog out to get a frame for our drone,
###450 and here he comes back with a hula-hoop.
###452 What are you gonna do with a hula-hoop?
###454 You working on your girly figure?
###455 ROG: I figure we put that as a base.
###457 DADDY: That's not a bad idea.
###458 TRAVIS: The plastic is fairly rigid.
###459 I think it's gonna work great for our airframe structure.
###462 ROG: Anything for the project of the week.
###465 TRAVIS: Now that we've got the frame,
###467 we've got to get back to figuring out that trigger.
###471 When we pushed the joystick on the remote control,
###473 the motor is supposed to turn
###474 and drive a plastic finger into the trigger,
###478 but that motor just won't move.
###480 MICHAEL: It ain't going. TRAVIS: I heard something.
###482 You don't reckon the servo is stuck, do you?
###484 MICHAEL: You know what? The trim might not be set right.
###487 Uncle Travis thinks the servo motor is broken,
###489 but I doubt it.
###491 I think the remote controller isn't set up right.
###494 I can make a simple adjustment to something called the trim.
###496 That should fix the problem.
###498 It'd be as easy as adjusting the dial.
###501 But sometimes Uncle Travis has just got to do things his way.
###504 TRAVIS: Maybe I'll just change the servo out.
###506 Do we have an extra one? MICHAEL: Check the trim.
###508 TRAVIS: I think it's something wrong with that servo.
###510 MICHAEL: So we did exactly what he told us to.
###513 We replaced the servo. And guess what?
###516 We put a brand-new servo on here,
###518 and it's doing the same thing. It ain't the servo.
###520 TRAVIS: Look, you got to figure this part out
###522 'cause this is a main part of the dag gum UAV, right?
###525 MICHAEL: We're trying.
###526 TRAVIS: Don't try. Do it!
###528 MICHAEL: Just give us some time. TRAVIS: All right.
###530 MICHAEL: Try that trim.
###532 Adjust that--
###533 whatever way it is, throw it all the way.
###535 TRAVIS: Oh! What the crap was that?
###541 DADDY: These experiments are dangerous.
###542 These guys are real rocket scientists.
###544 Don't try this at home.
###546 TRAVIS: We're making a portable weaponized drone
###549 to match Defense Department specs.
###551 It's got to fly two miles, send back video,
###553 and fit in a backpack.
###555 And there's a UAV expert who's gonna be here in just 24 hours
###560 who's gonna tell us if it makes the grade.
###563 MICHAEL: Try that trim. That's the only thing we hadn't tried.
###566 Adjust that--whatever way it is, throw it all the way--
###569 TRAVIS: Oh! What the crap was that?
###571 Did you all just shoot a paintball on Daddy's floor?
###573 MICHAEL: No. I don't think it was a paintball.
###576 TRAVIS: You ain't got the paintball, but did it go?
###578 MICHAEL: I think it just--yeah.
###579 TRAVIS: Do it again. Pete, are you making it do that?
###581 PETE: Yup. TRAVIS: Hey, hey, look at that.
###584 TRAVIS: He was right. Michael said it was the trim,
###586 and I should have listened to him.
###588 You sure I didn't tell you to check that?
###590 Now, that that's fixed,
###591 Michael and Pete are working on the remote video
###594 that mission control will use to control the drone.
###597 We're gonna make it so that a single soldier
###599 can control the drone from the field,
###601 but if he needs to, he can hand off that control
###603 back to home base that's miles and miles away.
###606 PETE: Was that about 100 feet?
###608 MICHAEL: Yeah, that's crystal clear, ain't it?
###610 PETE: That's good.
###611 TRAVIS: Once Rog finished putting
###612 all the motors and blades on,
###614 we created some unique landing gear.
###616 Daddy, we're gonna be using your cat fishing noodle.
###619 DADDY: I always have some of those noodles
###621 you use in the pool for kids to play with.
###623 I use them for fishing.
###625 Never imagined we'd be using them for a DARPA drone.
###628 TRAVIS: Cut me off four of them beer-can high.
###631 ROG: Beer-can high?
###632 Ain't that a unit of measurement that the Egyptians used?
###636 TRAVIS: They can zip-tie all the way through it.
###639 All the way, just set 'em right on there.
###641 Here, Michael.
###643 Hey, you two settle down before I get on the both of you.
###646 I think we're done.
###647 All we gotta do is hook the power up,
###649 and we're ready to go.
###650 There's still a lot to figure out,
###652 but if this thing doesn't work, we're screwed.
###654 We're gonna see if it flies.
###658 DADDY: I don't think he's a very experienced driver.
###660 I'm thinking he's probably gonna run the thing into us.
###664 TRAVIS: Everybody be ready.
###667 Here we go.
###671 Coming up with the throttle.
###673 [popping]
###683 Watch out now.
###686 DADDY: By George, it does fly, don't it?
###693 Look out for my truck.
###695 TRAVIS: There it goes!
###698 Oh!
###706 Oh, crap!
###708 Something happened, it went unstable.
###711 ROG: He started running that thing.
###713 I thought he had it, and I thought, man,
###715 'cause he just missed this one tree over here.
###717 And he hit these limbs right here.
###722 And I didn't know he couldn't drive that thing, man.
###724 TRAVIS: There's some things that come loose.
###726 I'm gonna have to go back through all the connections
###727 and make sure it works.
###729 DADDY: What do you think, son? What do you think happened?
###730 Did it just get out of range of the controls
###732 where it wouldn't respond?
###733 TRAVIS: It was pilot error.
###735 I couldn't tell where I was looking,
###737 and I think I just lost orientation
###740 of where was the front and where was the back,
###741 and when I made the correction, it wasn't the right way.
###744 I either need more practice
###746 or figure out a better way to do it.
###747 But that's after we fix the thing
###749 back to where we had it.
###751 I'm getting nervous
###753 because we still have to do a flight test in the morning
###755 before the expert gets here.
###756 It's gonna be a long night, man,
###758 'cause we ain't even thought about
###759 how to put the rockets on there,
###761 y'all ain't figured out how to ignite 'em,
###762 we still got to get a gun mount on here.
###764 We're a long way.
###766 At least we got a cooler full of beer.
###771 Man, we worked through the night,
###773 but we got it all fixed up.
###777 We're gonna do this test
###778 where we see how far of a range we can go with the helicopter
###781 and what kind of video we can get back.
###783 PETE: We're good with picture.
###784 TRAVIS: I'm gonna come in there and fly it from the video then.
###787 Then we got that UAV expert gonna be here in a little while.
###790 Gonna throttle up.
###791 There we go.
###805 ROG: I mean, it was just cool to be in the garage
###808 and watch that thing fly.
###811 But the best was when we flew over our buddy Sloth's house.
###814 TRAVIS: Sloth. What's he doing?
###816 MICHAEL: Looks like he's working.
###817 ROG: He's looking for Easter eggs.
###819 DADDY: Working my foot.
###820 TRAVIS: You can't throw a beer can that high, Sloth.
###822 The whole time I was hovering over Sloth's house,
###825 he kept throwing beer cans up.
###827 He knew that Rog was probably behind it somehow or other.
###830 Boy, that one got fairly close. Did you see that one?
###832 He's got a pretty good arm.
###833 I could have messed with Sloth all day.
###835 Here, I'm gonna get on outta there.
###836 ROG: Fly that thing home.
###838 TRAVIS: We had to fly the drone home
###841 so we could continue to work on it.
###843 We got our UAV back in one piece.
###845 Now that we know we can control it better with video,
###847 we still got to put that gun on there,
###849 and we've still got to put that rocket on there.
###852 Now, the other big requirement of the DARPA challenge
###854 is getting this thing to fit in a backpack.
###855 With all the setbacks,
###858 I just haven't had any time to work on that.
###860 But Michael and Pete assure me they've got that covered.
###863 I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
###865 First, Michael has got to get our rockets working.
###867 Michael, you about figured out how to fire them rockets yet?
###870 MICHAEL: Yeah, we're programming it.
###872 TRAVIS: While Michael worked on that,
###873 Rog figured out how to mount the gun to our drone.
###876 ROG: We got that gunner aimed right at you.
###879 TRAVIS: Look at what he's done.
###880 He's put the gun on the bottom of it.
###882 It looks pretty good. It's gonna work out just fine.
###884 Michael, I got to have that circuit finished
###887 to fire them rockets.
###888 So go finish that circuit.
###890 We're completing our arsenal
###892 with rocket-propelled explosives.
###894 But to fit them below the gun,
###895 we have to add legs to the bottom.
###898 Of course this all just adds more weight,
###900 but if we want to impress DARPA, we have to add those rockets.
###903 ROG: Where's that feller at?
###905 TRAVIS: Dr. Brian Landrum
###906 from the University of Alabama Huntsville
###908 will be here any minute.
###910 He's an expert on drone design for the Defense Department.
###913 So he's the perfect guy to judge what we're doing.
###915 DADDY: When Dr. Landrum sees it,
###917 he's got to get over his first initial shock.
###920 I mean, this thing's built by the Rocket City Rednecks.
###923 It's built out of hula-hoops and fun noodles.
###926 He's gonna think, "What in the world?"
###928 PETE: We want to do one more test.
###930 And the big question is,
###932 with all this weight and all these new weapons,
###934 will this thing even get off the ground?
###936 MICHAEL: We ready? Here we go.
###938 TRAVIS: Alright, bring it up Michael.
###941 There we go.
###946 What's going on? MICHAEL: It won't come up.
###948 TRAVIS: With all this extra weight,
###950 our drone is really struggling to get enough lift.
###953 ROG: Oh, oh, no!
###957 TRAVIS: Watch out. ROG: Don't touch that!
###964 TRAVIS: We built a portable weaponized drone
###965 for the DARPA challenge
###967 and invited a UAV expert, Dr. Brian Landrum,
###970 to evaluate our design during today's field test.
###973 TRAVIS: Oh, no, no, no!
###976 But his arrival wasn't exactly perfectly timed.
###979 The dag-gum UAV crashed
###981 right as Dr. Landrum's driving up.
###984 DADDY: Rockets going off, hitting the trees...
###986 TRAVIS: Hey! Hey, there's Dr. Landrum.
###989 I just played it cool,
###990 hoping that he wouldn't notice that something was really wrong.
###993 ROG: I know he saw that.
###997 TRAVIS: We've had a few little ups and downs.
###1000 We just did a rocket test, and...
###1002 DR. LANDRUM: Rockets and guns, huh?
###1004 TRAVIS: Rockets and guns and helicopters.
###1006 LANDRUM: Oh, well, that's a mix.
###1008 TRAVIS: We're gonna tweak some things,
###1009 so, Daddy, why don't you take him over to the test field,
###1013 and we'll meet y'all over there in a couple minutes.
###1014 We've set up a field test with targets
###1018 to put the drone through its paces.
###1019 But we're in trouble.
###1021 We've only got a few minutes really to fix this thing,
###1023 so the next test flight is gonna be in front of the UAV expert.
###1027 ROG: We put it back together.
###1028 We're expecting it to work.
###1029 At least that's what we're telling the expert guy.
###1032 TRAVIS: Turns out those legs we added to the bottom of the drone
###1036 affected the balance just enough to keep it from flying right.
###1039 So we redistributed some of the weight.
###1041 I think that should do it.
###1044 The key thing for this project
###1046 is that it can be carried in a backpack
###1048 by a single soldier in the field.
###1050 Now, I've assigned Michael and Pete to solve that problem.
###1053 I'm kind of excited to see what they've come up with.
###1062 Is this the backpack you made?
###1064 MICHAEL: Well, it's a backpack. You said, "Protect the UAV."
###1068 TRAVIS: Can you even get that thing on?
###1070 It's this huge box that you just slide the thing in.
###1072 There's no disassembly of the UAV at all.
###1074 I can't see a soldier wearing that into the field.
###1077 But it is too late to fix that now.
###1080 Hopefully we can impress Dr. Landrum
###1082 with other aspects of our design.
###1084 DADDY: Yeah, there's some pressure on it
###1086 because you don't want to mess up
###1087 in front of a guy like that.
###1089 And I figure we're about to.
###1092 LANDRUM: I finally got a good look at their drone design,
###1094 and it's unique, to say the least,
###1096 but I'm gonna reserve my judgment
###1098 till I see it in action.
###1099 TRAVIS: Put it in, be careful.
###1101 Don't tear up the rockets or whatever.
###1102 Y'all figure that out.
###1104 Alright, so, Brian, what we're gonna do
###1105 is I've set up a war game.
###1108 And we're gonna put Rog out there somewhere.
###1110 He's gonna take the gun, he's gonna go hide,
###1112 and he's gonna be a sniper.
###1113 So then I'm gonna crawl in
###1115 through the woods somewhere here,
###1116 and I'm gonna come out and decide
###1117 this is the right place to deploy the UAV.
###1120 And then we're gonna launch it.
###1122 It can be controlled from the tactical operations center here,
###1124 and you guys will be able to watch it on the big screen.
###1127 And then, when we're done taking out the sniper,
###1129 we've got some larger vehicles over the hill
###1131 that we're gonna go and take out with the rockets.
###1133 Michael, did you put targets out there like I said to?
###1136 MICHAEL: You will be surprised when you head out there.
###1138 TRAVIS: So you did put some targets out there.
###1140 Rog and I got our paintball gear on,
###1142 and he took off to go hide and play sniper.
###1145 ROG: Yeah, I had a real good hiding spot.
###1147 It was real snaky.
###1149 You know how snipers like snaky spots.
###1151 TRAVIS: Then Michael helped me get the backpack on.
###1153 I started easing out into the grass and hiding,
###1156 trying to find a good place that I could deploy this thing
###1158 and then go look for Rog.
###1159 TRAVIS: Hey, Michael. MICHAEL: Yeah, go ahead.
###1161 TRAVIS: I think I found a pretty good spot.
###1162 Rog can't be too far away,
###1164 so I'm gonna start getting ready to deploy this thing.
###1166 MICHAEL: 10-4. We're set up, and we're waiting on a signal.
###1174 TRAVIS: Here we go.
###1188 I took off running,
###1189 and I turned control over to Daddy back at the command post.
###1195 Shoot him.
###1197 If you can find Rog, start shooting him.
###1199 ROG: Yeah, I went both guns blazing at the drone.
###1202 It wasn't doing anything.
###1203 The propellers would just eat it up.
###1209 DADDY: I'm looking at Rog, and I'm thinking,
###1212 "This is my chance. I've got him in my sites,"
###1214 so I pressed the trigger.
###1216 ROG: You got me!
###1219 DADDY: I got Rog.
###1220 Now, he said he wasn't gonna get hit,
###1222 and I agreed with him.
###1223 There's no way we'd hit him.
###1224 MICHAEL: Oh, you got him!
###1226 DADDY: And I zapped him right in the chest.
###1228 ROG: I'm out!
###1230 LANDRUM: For this next test,
###1232 I'm not so sure they're gonna be able to hit their targets
###1234 with these rockets.
###1236 MICHAEL: We're moving towards the tanks and the trucks.
###1239 DADDY: Now we're gonna try to take out the convoy
###1240 of tanks and trucks with our rockets.
###1247 Alright, here we go.
###1251 MICHAEL: Oh, we launched the first rocket.
###1254 Daddy: Oh, missed--
###1257 [laughing]
###1258 TRAVIS: Y'all missed it. Y'all hit it a little better.
###1260 MICHAEL: That second shot... Missed it on the second shot.
###1267 Rog: Oh!
###1268 TRAVIS: There we go! Yeah!
###1270 When they started firing off those rockets,
###1271 I wasn't sure if they were hitting anything.
###1273 And then I saw a big fireball go up,
###1275 so it was clear they hit one of the targets.
###1278 MICHAEL: Oh, yeah.
###1279 After I set up the targets, I also doused them in gasoline.
###1281 Come on, hit that thing.
###1283 Come on, let me get the nose down.
###1286 There you go.
###1287 [laughing and cheering]
###1293 DADDY: Got him! PETE: Good job!
###1297 We're bringing this thing home. We got all three targets.
###1300 Good shooting. MICHAEL: That's incredible.
###1305 DADDY: I figured we'd crash and tear it up
###1307 like we'd been doing,
###1309 but we actually got the thing back in one piece.
###1311 TRAVIS: Did you get him?
###1312 DADDY: We shot him.
###1314 ROG: Which one of y'all shot me, man?
###1315 TRAVIS: Look at that right there. Who got him?
###1317 MICHAEL: That was Papaw.
###1318 TRAVIS: That's good shooting, Daddy. Look at that!
###1321 LANDRUM: Weaponizing a small system like this,
###1323 I really think this is something DARPA would be interested in.
###1325 Overall, this was just a great test.
###1327 I think it really has a lot of promise.
###1329 TRAVIS: Our UAV drone worked really well.
###1331 Putting rockets on there and a gun was pretty neat.
###1334 So I think there's some immediate
###1335 real-world applications for our design.
###1337 Hula-hoop taters, hula-hoop taters.
###1339 ROG: Right on, right on.
###1342 All this talk about real-world applications
###1345 got me to thinking.
###1346 So I took my boys out, and we did a little drone fishing.
###1351 Look at that fish!
###1353 He's too little. We got to throw him back.
###1355 You want to touch him?
###1357 Okay.
