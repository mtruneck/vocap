1
0:0:6,506 --> 0:0:8,41
Hey, honey.
Hey.


2
0:0:8,41 --> 0:0:10,76
What you workin' on?


3
0:0:10,76 --> 0:0:12,905
Wedding invitations
for two optometrists.


4
0:0:12,905 --> 0:0:15,668
I need to finish another hundred
of these things.


5
0:0:15,668 --> 0:0:17,207
What is this?


6
0:0:17,207 --> 0:0:20,69
Oh, it's called
micro calligraphy.


7
0:0:20,69 --> 0:0:22,668
How's anybody
supposed to read that?


8
0:0:22,668 --> 0:0:25,464
We put a magnifier on top.


9
0:0:25,464 --> 0:0:28,28
Nice, right?


10
0:0:28,28 --> 0:0:29,294
Wow.


11
0:0:29,294 --> 0:0:30,525
If I'd have known
you could make


12
0:0:30,525 --> 0:0:32,24
something this small
look this big,


13
0:0:32,24 --> 0:0:35,418
I'd have got you a smaller ring
in one of these boxes.


14
0:0:35,418 --> 0:0:37,152
Aren't you supposed
to be working?


15
0:0:37,152 --> 0:0:41,84
I wanted to talk to you about
me getting a new SUV for work.


16
0:0:41,84 --> 0:0:44,49
Okay, what's wrong
with the old one?


17
0:0:44,49 --> 0:0:47,315
I need something more
practical than that pimpmobile.


18
0:0:47,315 --> 0:0:49,915
Nick, don't you remember
we just bought a new house?


19
0:0:49,915 --> 0:0:52,349
We haven't even been
on a honeymoon yet.


20
0:0:52,349 --> 0:0:54,482
I need this, Suzanne.


21
0:0:54,482 --> 0:0:55,815
Okay.


22
0:0:55,815 --> 0:1:0,549
Hold on.


23
0:1:0,549 --> 0:1:2,317
You see this?


24
0:1:2,317 --> 0:1:4,984
This is a giant pile of bills.


25
0:1:4,984 --> 0:1:6,118
Of course it looks giant.


26
0:1:6,118 --> 0:1:8,218
You're wearing
magnifying goggles.


27
0:1:8,218 --> 0:1:12,952
Electric, gas,
water, insurance,


28
0:1:12,952 --> 0:1:15,986
ooh, "urgent and confidential."


29
0:1:15,986 --> 0:1:17,354
We owe so much on this one,


30
0:1:17,354 --> 0:1:19,855
they won't even tell us
what it is.


31
0:1:19,855 --> 0:1:20,855
That's it?


32
0:1:20,855 --> 0:1:21,889
No?


33
0:1:21,889 --> 0:1:22,856
Just like that?


34
0:1:22,856 --> 0:1:25,39
It is not just like that.


35
0:1:25,39 --> 0:1:27,391
Nick, we don't have
any extra money,


36
0:1:27,391 --> 0:1:32,593
so you're just gonna
have to unpimp your ride.

You know,
I'm glad I got married,


42
0:1:51,904 --> 0:1:53,272
It's on.


43
0:1:53,272 --> 0:1:54,639
She's got reasons
she doesn't want to do


44
0:1:54,639 --> 0:1:55,773
what you want her to do.


45
0:1:55,773 --> 0:1:57,774
You have to show her the reasons
why she should--


46
0:1:57,774 --> 0:2:0,341
9:00, get that.


47
0:2:0,341 --> 0:2:1,576
I thought I did that.
Uh-uh.


48
0:2:1,576 --> 0:2:3,31
You didn't do it;
You tried to do that,


49
0:2:3,31 --> 0:2:6,511
a common source of frustration
amongst married couples.


50
0:2:6,511 --> 0:2:9,8
You're gonna want to switch over
to shotgun there.


51
0:2:9,8 --> 0:2:10,981
See, you got to present the pros
and the cons


52
0:2:10,981 --> 0:2:12,648
and convince her
that you having this car


53
0:2:12,648 --> 0:2:13,949
is in her best interest,


54
0:2:13,949 --> 0:2:15,316
kind of like the way
I convinced you


55
0:2:15,316 --> 0:2:16,717
to let me crash here
last night.


56
0:2:16,717 --> 0:2:18,285
Yeah, 'cause it was
in my best interest


57
0:2:18,285 --> 0:2:20,386
not to have you crying on the
phone at 2:00 in the morning.


58
0:2:20,386 --> 0:2:21,319
Bingo.


59
0:2:21,319 --> 0:2:22,954
Gigi still coming over
tomorrow?


60
0:2:22,954 --> 0:2:23,921
Yes, indeed.


61
0:2:23,921 --> 0:2:26,322
You will die now.


62
0:2:26,322 --> 0:2:28,56
She's dropping off
an autographed Jersey,


63
0:2:28,56 --> 0:2:30,624
a Michael Vick
Atlanta Falcons Jersey.


64
0:2:30,624 --> 0:2:31,591
You mean the Eagles.


65
0:2:31,591 --> 0:2:32,859
No, no, Falcons.


66
0:2:32,859 --> 0:2:35,46
I got a guy who collects
fallen athlete memorabilia.


67
0:2:35,46 --> 0:2:36,627
My man's got it all.


68
0:2:36,627 --> 0:2:38,628
He's got Rae Carruth's
Panthers Jersey,


69
0:2:38,628 --> 0:2:40,362
a Darryl Henley Rams Jersey.


70
0:2:40,362 --> 0:2:42,664
He's got a Bob Probert Jersey.


71
0:2:42,664 --> 0:2:44,165
Bob Probert?


72
0:2:44,165 --> 0:2:45,433
Hockey player.


73
0:2:45,433 --> 0:2:51,538
Quiet as it's kept,
white guys mess up too.


74
0:2:51,538 --> 0:2:54,73
You do realize that's just
a video game, right?


75
0:2:54,73 --> 0:2:56,438
And you do realize those
people on your Facebook page


76
0:2:56,438 --> 0:2:59,273
aren't your friends, right?


77
0:2:59,273 --> 0:3:1,474
"Why...


78
0:3:1,474 --> 0:3:3,242
"Is...


79
0:3:3,242 --> 0:3:4,875
"My...


80
0:3:4,875 --> 0:3:6,41
"Brother...


81
0:3:6,41 --> 0:3:9,12
An idiot?"


82
0:3:9,12 --> 0:3:10,813
Post.


83
0:3:10,813 --> 0:3:12,8
Who the heck is Vin-man?


84
0:3:12,8 --> 0:3:13,8
Me.


85
0:3:13,8 --> 0:3:14,881
Ke-Vin, Vin-man.


86
0:3:14,881 --> 0:3:16,282
It's my tournament name.


87
0:3:16,282 --> 0:3:18,216
I won my first two rounds.


88
0:3:18,216 --> 0:3:19,85
I'm trying to get back
to playing this kid


89
0:3:19,85 --> 0:3:20,884
called the tin man.


90
0:3:20,884 --> 0:3:22,552
He beat me in straight sets
last time.


91
0:3:22,552 --> 0:3:25,82
I'm not letting that
happen again.


92
0:3:25,82 --> 0:3:26,955
Wow!


93
0:3:26,955 --> 0:3:28,322
Nice shot...


94
0:3:28,322 --> 0:3:29,656
for an idiot.


95
0:3:29,656 --> 0:3:33,558
I'll take that
as a compliment.


96
0:3:33,558 --> 0:3:36,293
So when's the big match?


97
0:3:36,293 --> 0:3:37,294
Tomorrow.


98
0:3:37,294 --> 0:3:38,295
You comin'?


99
0:3:38,295 --> 0:3:39,361
To your fake tennis match?


100
0:3:39,361 --> 0:3:40,461
Sure.


101
0:3:40,461 --> 0:3:41,529
Good.


102
0:3:41,529 --> 0:3:47,134
Bring your fake friends.


103
0:3:47,134 --> 0:3:49,501
Wow.
What?


104
0:3:49,501 --> 0:3:51,436
Your skin is amazing.


105
0:3:51,436 --> 0:3:53,804
Even under 20 times
magnification,


106
0:3:53,804 --> 0:3:56,406
all I see are pores,
and it looks smooth as glass.


107
0:3:56,406 --> 0:4:0,509
Thank you.


108
0:4:0,509 --> 0:4:1,509
What?


109
0:4:1,509 --> 0:4:3,177
Mm.


110
0:4:3,177 --> 0:4:10,215
There must be a-a smudge
in these goggles.


111
0:4:10,215 --> 0:4:11,816
Mm-hmm.


112
0:4:11,816 --> 0:4:13,15
What are you doing?


113
0:4:13,15 --> 0:4:14,217
There's a little bit of hair.


114
0:4:14,217 --> 0:4:15,685
I'm gonna get it.
Uh-uh, no.


115
0:4:15,685 --> 0:4:16,685
What?


116
0:4:16,685 --> 0:4:18,12
It could be a start
of a mustache.


117
0:4:18,12 --> 0:4:19,788
I do not have a mustache.


118
0:4:19,788 --> 0:4:21,355
Not yet,
but it's like you got


119
0:4:21,355 --> 0:4:22,957
a little sleeper cell
in your face


120
0:4:22,957 --> 0:4:25,792
trying to take
down your upper lip.


121
0:4:25,792 --> 0:4:27,16
Okay, fine.


122
0:4:27,16 --> 0:4:28,895
Pull it.
Okay.


123
0:4:28,895 --> 0:4:31,631
Be still.


124
0:4:31,631 --> 0:4:35,301
Ow!


125
0:4:35,301 --> 0:4:36,302
Much better.


126
0:4:36,302 --> 0:4:38,537
Oh, goodness.


127
0:4:38,537 --> 0:4:40,739
All right, well, Gigi,
let me ask you something.


128
0:4:40,739 --> 0:4:41,94
What?


129
0:4:41,94 --> 0:4:43,775
If you were gonna go
on a honeymoon for cheap,


130
0:4:43,775 --> 0:4:45,76
where would you go?


131
0:4:45,76 --> 0:4:47,111
Back to the man who would dare
say such a thing to me


132
0:4:47,111 --> 0:4:49,46
and tell him
we're getting a divorce.


133
0:4:49,46 --> 0:4:50,38
Why?


134
0:4:50,38 --> 0:4:52,916
Because Nick wants to buy
a new SUV,


135
0:4:52,916 --> 0:4:54,45
and I told him
that we couldn't afford it


136
0:4:54,45 --> 0:4:56,119
because of all of our
other bills,


137
0:4:56,119 --> 0:4:57,753
and then I mentioned
that we hadn't even


138
0:4:57,753 --> 0:4:59,54
been on a honeymoon yet.


139
0:4:59,54 --> 0:5:0,756
You slipped that in
with the bills?


140
0:5:0,756 --> 0:5:1,957
Oh, that's clever.


141
0:5:1,957 --> 0:5:3,358
I got to remember that.


142
0:5:3,358 --> 0:5:5,526
So why does he want
a new SUV?


143
0:5:5,526 --> 0:5:8,762
Well, he says that carrying
stuff around in his car


144
0:5:8,762 --> 0:5:9,863
is messing it up.


145
0:5:9,863 --> 0:5:11,398
Oh, girl, I know exactly
what he means.


146
0:5:11,398 --> 0:5:12,599
I have a pair
of Louis Vuitton pumps.


147
0:5:12,599 --> 0:5:14,234
You think I'm gonna
mess those things up


148
0:5:14,234 --> 0:5:15,401
walking around in 'em?


149
0:5:15,401 --> 0:5:17,303
If you're not walking
around in 'em,


150
0:5:17,303 --> 0:5:19,638
then why--
forget I said anything.


151
0:5:19,638 --> 0:5:20,639
Mm-hmm.


152
0:5:20,639 --> 0:5:21,673
Let him get the new car.


153
0:5:21,673 --> 0:5:22,674
If he makes more money,


154
0:5:22,674 --> 0:5:24,742
you'll have a better
honeymoon later.


155
0:5:24,742 --> 0:5:26,744
Go big, or go home.


156
0:5:26,744 --> 0:5:28,479
This is a marriage.


157
0:5:28,479 --> 0:5:31,281
It is not Las Vegas.


158
0:5:31,281 --> 0:5:40,101
It's all a gamble to me.


159
0:5:40,101 --> 0:5:41,735
Wow.


160
0:5:41,735 --> 0:5:43,203
Ooh.


161
0:5:43,203 --> 0:5:45,38
This is nice.
Yeah.


162
0:5:45,38 --> 0:5:47,106
If it had a widescreen TV
and microwave,


163
0:5:47,106 --> 0:5:49,107
I'd live in there.


164
0:5:49,107 --> 0:5:50,308
You know, the Highlander comes


165
0:5:50,308 --> 0:5:52,243
with one of the most
comprehensive lists


166
0:5:52,243 --> 0:5:54,545
of standard safety features
in its class.


167
0:5:54,545 --> 0:5:56,147
Comprehensive, huh?


168
0:5:56,147 --> 0:5:58,449
Including seven airbags.
Seven?


169
0:5:58,449 --> 0:5:59,416
Uh-huh.


170
0:5:59,416 --> 0:6:0,651
Backup cameras.
Oh, my God.


171
0:6:0,651 --> 0:6:1,618
That's right.


172
0:6:1,618 --> 0:6:3,486
Large side view mirrors.
I saw those.


173
0:6:3,486 --> 0:6:4,653
Uh-huh.


174
0:6:4,653 --> 0:6:6,321
Sir?
I like this.


175
0:6:6,321 --> 0:6:7,289
Sir.


176
0:6:7,289 --> 0:6:9,257
Airbags.


177
0:6:9,257 --> 0:6:10,725
Sir.
Oh.


178
0:6:10,725 --> 0:6:12,893
Yeah.


179
0:6:12,893 --> 0:6:14,227
So what do you think?


180
0:6:14,227 --> 0:6:15,695
I love it.


181
0:6:15,695 --> 0:6:17,997
I just have to see my guy
down at the bank, you know,


182
0:6:17,997 --> 0:6:19,198
so I can convince my wife.


183
0:6:19,198 --> 0:6:21,767
Whoa, wife.


184
0:6:21,767 --> 0:6:23,534
I'm sorry, man.


185
0:6:23,534 --> 0:6:26,17
You can't even spend
your own money.


186
0:6:26,17 --> 0:6:27,171
You know what?


187
0:6:27,171 --> 0:6:29,173
Sit in the car
as long as you like.


188
0:6:29,173 --> 0:6:33,91
We close at 9:00.


189
0:6:33,91 --> 0:6:36,146
Kevin, watch it!


190
0:6:36,146 --> 0:6:37,113
Yes.


191
0:6:37,113 --> 0:6:39,181
We own you.


192
0:6:39,181 --> 0:6:40,149
"My...


193
0:6:40,149 --> 0:6:41,649
"Brother...Is...


194
0:6:41,649 --> 0:6:42,716
"Going...


195
0:6:42,716 --> 0:6:43,717
"In...


196
0:6:43,717 --> 0:6:44,685
"On...


197
0:6:44,685 --> 0:6:45,685
"This...


198
0:6:45,685 --> 0:6:46,719
"Punk...


199
0:6:46,719 --> 0:6:49,221
Hard."


200
0:6:49,221 --> 0:6:50,422
I'm not sure I like that.


201
0:6:50,422 --> 0:6:51,523
Could you delete that?


202
0:6:51,523 --> 0:6:52,524
No.


203
0:6:52,524 --> 0:6:55,459
Post.


204
0:6:55,459 --> 0:6:56,427
All right, that's it.


205
0:6:56,427 --> 0:6:58,562
Next up, tin man.


206
0:6:58,562 --> 0:7:0,831
I'm gonna broadcast you live
on my streaming page.


207
0:7:0,831 --> 0:7:1,832
For real?


208
0:7:1,832 --> 0:7:3,2
Yup, that's right.


209
0:7:3,2 --> 0:7:4,935
I'm putting you on.


210
0:7:4,935 --> 0:7:8,605
Don't embarrass me.
Shut up.


211
0:7:8,605 --> 0:7:10,206
Then what'd she say?


212
0:7:10,206 --> 0:7:11,874
And what you say, dawg?


213
0:7:11,874 --> 0:7:13,341
Oh, no, you didn't!


214
0:7:13,341 --> 0:7:14,376
Oh, ho, ho!


215
0:7:14,376 --> 0:7:15,91
That is tight!


216
0:7:15,91 --> 0:7:16,977
True DAT.
Listen, yo.


217
0:7:16,977 --> 0:7:18,445
Yeah, yeah, I got to be out.


218
0:7:18,445 --> 0:7:20,781
Holla!


219
0:7:20,781 --> 0:7:22,616
So Mr. Kingston-Persons,


220
0:7:22,616 --> 0:7:24,618
I've got all your information
here for the auto loan.


221
0:7:24,618 --> 0:7:26,152
I just have to put it
in the computer.


222
0:7:26,152 --> 0:7:29,54
Well, see, I don't want
the actual loan yet.


223
0:7:29,54 --> 0:7:30,956
I just want to see
what kind of rate I can get


224
0:7:30,956 --> 0:7:32,59
on the SUV
I'm thinking about buying.


225
0:7:32,59 --> 0:7:33,791
Uh-huh.
Well, just hold on.


226
0:7:33,791 --> 0:7:35,292
We're gonna run
your credit here,


227
0:7:35,292 --> 0:7:37,794
and if there's no problem,
I can get you that loan today.


228
0:7:37,794 --> 0:7:39,762
That was for,
what, $30,000, right?


229
0:7:39,762 --> 0:7:40,796
Right.


230
0:7:40,796 --> 0:7:42,763
You know, we also do financing


231
0:7:42,763 --> 0:7:46,99
for all-terrain vehicles,
jet skis, personal aircraft.


232
0:7:46,99 --> 0:7:47,733
I just want you
to run my credit


233
0:7:47,733 --> 0:7:50,602
so I can see what kind of
interest rate I qualify for.


234
0:7:50,602 --> 0:7:52,569
Then I can decide if I can--


235
0:7:52,569 --> 0:7:54,403
wassup, shorty?


236
0:7:54,403 --> 0:7:56,737
Oh, you know, it's all
kind of busy up in here.


237
0:7:56,737 --> 0:7:58,172
I'ma have to hit you back.


238
0:7:58,172 --> 0:7:59,974
A'ight, a'ight.


239
0:7:59,974 --> 0:8:1,308
A'ight.


240
0:8:1,308 --> 0:8:2,71
All right, so where were we?


241
0:8:2,71 --> 0:8:4,811
How long have you been
at your current job?


242
0:8:4,811 --> 0:8:5,845
Two years.


243
0:8:5,845 --> 0:8:7,46
Two years, all right.


244
0:8:7,46 --> 0:8:10,285
I'll just have to input
your social now


245
0:8:10,285 --> 0:8:13,924
and wait a minute or two,
and boo-yah.


246
0:8:13,924 --> 0:8:15,96
Oh, excuse me.


247
0:8:15,96 --> 0:8:18,496
Oh, Rafael, my dawg,
wuzzup?


248
0:8:18,496 --> 0:8:19,931
What up, what up?


249
0:8:19,931 --> 0:8:22,332
No, you know, you know,
grindin', grindin'.


250
0:8:22,332 --> 0:8:25,168
No, oh, listen, I got to
holler back at you, a'ight?


251
0:8:25,168 --> 0:8:26,636
A'ight.
[barks]


252
0:8:26,636 --> 0:8:29,338
[Laughs]


253
0:8:29,338 --> 0:8:30,772
Oh.


254
0:8:30,772 --> 0:8:32,407
What's wrong?


255
0:8:32,407 --> 0:8:34,175
Well, I'm sorry, sir.


256
0:8:34,175 --> 0:8:36,51
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to give you that loan.


257
0:8:36,51 --> 0:8:38,745
It says that
you're too high a risk.


258
0:8:38,745 --> 0:8:39,746
What?
Yeah.


259
0:8:39,746 --> 0:8:40,747
How come?


260
0:8:40,747 --> 0:8:43,82
My credit should be fine.


261
0:8:43,82 --> 0:8:45,584
Look, I just get approval
and rejection codes here.


262
0:8:45,584 --> 0:8:47,352
You know, if you want
to know more,


263
0:8:47,352 --> 0:8:48,787
you have to get
your credit report.


264
0:8:48,787 --> 0:8:49,788
I'm sorry.


265
0:8:49,788 --> 0:8:51,824
Excuse me for just a second.


266
0:8:51,824 --> 0:8:53,459
Wazzup?


267
0:8:53,459 --> 0:8:58,763
[Laughs]


268
0:8:58,763 --> 0:9:0,965
"Urgent and confidential."


269
0:9:0,965 --> 0:9:12,973
What's this, my subscription
to <i>Essence</i> is about to expire?


270
0:9:12,973 --> 0:9:15,342
"Dear Miss Kingston,
your delinquent account


271
0:9:15,342 --> 0:9:17,81
"in the amount of $15,000


272
0:9:17,81 --> 0:9:20,646
has been referred
to my office for collection."


273
0:9:20,646 --> 0:9:22,14
Damn.


274
0:9:22,14 --> 0:9:35,597
That is
urgent and confidential.


275
0:9:35,597 --> 0:9:36,864
Hey, honey.


276
0:9:36,864 --> 0:9:39,866
Hey, babe.


277
0:9:39,866 --> 0:9:42,701
Remember how earlier I was
talking about buying a new car?


278
0:9:42,701 --> 0:9:45,704
And remember how earlier
I said no?


279
0:9:45,704 --> 0:9:47,539
Yeah, but I was
thinking if I could maybe


280
0:9:47,539 --> 0:9:48,973
make it make sense to you--


281
0:9:48,973 --> 0:9:53,244
baby, I already made all the
sense I need to make out of it.


282
0:9:53,244 --> 0:9:55,112
I know it already makes sense
to you,


283
0:9:55,112 --> 0:9:57,147
but I figured I could get
some information.


284
0:9:57,147 --> 0:9:58,582
So I went to the dealership.


285
0:9:58,582 --> 0:9:59,582
Nick, you didn't.


286
0:9:59,582 --> 0:10:1,117
Look, I didn't buy the car.


287
0:10:1,117 --> 0:10:3,385
Okay, so far, so good.


288
0:10:3,385 --> 0:10:5,455
But it turns out that
even if I wanted to,


289
0:10:5,455 --> 0:10:6,923
I couldn't
because of our credit.


290
0:10:6,923 --> 0:10:10,526
Well, I told you
we owed too many people.


291
0:10:10,526 --> 0:10:12,994
Yeah, but I've never been
denied credit before.


292
0:10:12,994 --> 0:10:14,729
So I got our credit report.


293
0:10:14,729 --> 0:10:17,396
Turns out
there's a mistake on here.


294
0:10:17,396 --> 0:10:24,268
This says I have a debt
in collections of $15,000.


295
0:10:24,268 --> 0:10:25,669
Um...


296
0:10:25,669 --> 0:10:32,908
Let me see that.


297
0:10:32,908 --> 0:10:35,176
That is unbelievable.


298
0:10:35,176 --> 0:10:36,71
I know.


299
0:10:36,71 --> 0:10:38,312
I pay my bills.


300
0:10:38,312 --> 0:10:39,846
If I wasn't gonna
pay something,


301
0:10:39,846 --> 0:10:42,481
it'd be something small
like ring tone bill


302
0:10:42,481 --> 0:10:44,883
or my pay-per-view movies.


303
0:10:44,883 --> 0:10:47,418
Are you out in that garage
ordering pay-per-view?


304
0:10:47,418 --> 0:10:48,552
We just got married.


305
0:10:48,552 --> 0:10:50,287
There's more than that
on pay-per-view.


306
0:10:50,287 --> 0:10:51,321
Like what?


307
0:10:51,321 --> 0:10:52,856
Can we talk about
the credit report?


308
0:10:52,856 --> 0:10:54,524
I will take care of this.


309
0:10:54,524 --> 0:10:56,159
You already did your part


310
0:10:56,159 --> 0:10:57,926
you found the problem,


311
0:10:57,926 --> 0:10:59,828
even though you did it
behind my back.


312
0:10:59,828 --> 0:11:1,329
I was doing research.


313
0:11:1,329 --> 0:11:2,463
What?


314
0:11:2,463 --> 0:11:5,65
Well, the next time
you decide to do research,


315
0:11:5,65 --> 0:11:6,599
we should discuss it first,


316
0:11:6,599 --> 0:11:8,634
because, you know,
I don't like the idea


317
0:11:8,634 --> 0:11:10,301
that you're out there
running around,


318
0:11:10,301 --> 0:11:12,603
finding out information
from God knows where.


319
0:11:12,603 --> 0:11:14,304
You know, like,
I'm your wife,


320
0:11:14,304 --> 0:11:15,638
and if you need
to know something,


321
0:11:15,638 --> 0:11:29,92
then I need to know that
you need to know it, you know?


322
0:11:29,92 --> 0:11:31,188
Oh, my God.


323
0:11:31,188 --> 0:11:33,29
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.


324
0:11:33,29 --> 0:11:35,58
How are you gonna
hide the fact


325
0:11:35,58 --> 0:11:40,797
that you owe $15,000
from Nick?


326
0:11:40,797 --> 0:11:43,866
I'm gonna pay it.


327
0:11:43,866 --> 0:11:46,969
Are you like
one of those characters on <i>Lost</i>


328
0:11:46,969 --> 0:11:48,67
with a dark past?


329
0:11:48,67 --> 0:11:49,604
Because I love you,


330
0:11:49,604 --> 0:11:51,138
but if people are coming
to kill you,


331
0:11:51,138 --> 0:11:52,571
I can't be your friend.


332
0:11:52,571 --> 0:11:55,405
What is wrong
with you, man?


333
0:11:55,405 --> 0:11:57,408
It's the student loan people.


334
0:11:57,408 --> 0:11:59,11
Is that what they're
calling it now?


335
0:11:59,11 --> 0:12:0,148
Gigi.
What?


336
0:12:0,148 --> 0:12:2,5
You know that after
you graduate college,


337
0:12:2,5 --> 0:12:4,752
you can defer paying off
your student loans.


338
0:12:4,752 --> 0:12:7,88
I've been doing it so long,
I forgot.


339
0:12:7,88 --> 0:12:9,69
You forgot you owe $15,000?


340
0:12:9,69 --> 0:12:12,125
You forget you owe people
money all the time.


341
0:12:12,125 --> 0:12:15,228
No, I have never forgotten
I owe people money.


342
0:12:15,228 --> 0:12:17,463
Now, there are people
who have given me money


343
0:12:17,463 --> 0:12:19,98
who believe I owe them,


344
0:12:19,98 --> 0:12:21,567
but I believe we have
a fundamental misunderstanding


345
0:12:21,567 --> 0:12:24,169
on the terms of the exchange.


346
0:12:24,169 --> 0:12:25,47
Right.


347
0:12:25,47 --> 0:12:28,673
Well, how are you gonna
pay off $15,000?


348
0:12:28,673 --> 0:12:30,374
I have an account.


349
0:12:30,374 --> 0:12:33,276
I've been putting money in it
for a long time.


350
0:12:33,276 --> 0:12:35,211
I was saving it
for a rainy day.


351
0:12:35,211 --> 0:12:36,679
Suzanne!
What?


352
0:12:36,679 --> 0:12:39,281
Why didn't you tell me
you had $15,000?


353
0:12:39,281 --> 0:12:40,816
I could've used that money.


354
0:12:40,816 --> 0:12:42,55
Because I believe
we would have


355
0:12:42,55 --> 0:12:50,79
a fundamental misunderstanding
on the terms of the exchange.


356
0:12:50,79 --> 0:12:53,326
All right, got
the live streaming set up.


357
0:12:53,326 --> 0:12:54,727
Good.


358
0:12:54,727 --> 0:12:56,963
'Cause the tin man is about
to get his butt handed to him


359
0:12:56,963 --> 0:12:57,93
by the Vin-man.


360
0:12:57,93 --> 0:12:59,765
"Oh, it's on."


361
0:12:59,765 --> 0:13:14,43
Post.


362
0:13:14,43 --> 0:13:16,44
Okay.


363
0:13:16,44 --> 0:13:17,79
All right.


364
0:13:17,79 --> 0:13:21,716
Let's do this.


365
0:13:21,716 --> 0:13:23,15
What's up?


366
0:13:23,15 --> 0:13:25,85
Explain.


367
0:13:25,85 --> 0:13:26,486
I have a tennis match.


368
0:13:26,486 --> 0:13:27,655
When?
Now.


369
0:13:27,655 --> 0:13:28,657
Where?


370
0:13:28,657 --> 0:13:29,691
Online.


371
0:13:29,691 --> 0:13:31,24
Sad.


372
0:13:31,24 --> 0:13:32,625
It's not sad.


373
0:13:32,625 --> 0:13:34,46
It's the future.


374
0:13:34,46 --> 0:13:36,596
What's with the outfit?


375
0:13:36,596 --> 0:13:38,932
Well, I happen to be dressed
as my favorite tennis player.


376
0:13:38,932 --> 0:13:40,99
And that would be?


377
0:13:40,99 --> 0:13:41,767
Serena Williams.


378
0:13:41,767 --> 0:13:43,435
So that we're clear,


379
0:13:43,435 --> 0:13:45,7
you're sleeping
on a man's couch,


380
0:13:45,7 --> 0:13:48,873
playing video tennis
wearing a unitard,


381
0:13:48,873 --> 0:13:51,809
and that's not sad.


382
0:13:51,809 --> 0:14:0,15
It's a little sad.


383
0:14:0,15 --> 0:14:1,316
Who's the tin man?


384
0:14:1,316 --> 0:14:2,918
Mar-tin.


385
0:14:2,918 --> 0:14:4,185
Tin man.


386
0:14:4,185 --> 0:14:6,687
'Cause when I play tennis,
I'm heartless.


387
0:14:6,687 --> 0:14:8,422
Wizard of oz.


388
0:14:8,422 --> 0:14:10,79
Also sad.


389
0:14:10,79 --> 0:14:12,91
Here's your Jersey.


390
0:14:12,91 --> 0:14:15,294
Thank you.


391
0:14:15,294 --> 0:14:18,163
Well, I'm here...


392
0:14:18,163 --> 0:14:19,965
And I'm hungry.


393
0:14:19,965 --> 0:14:21,99
That's because when you eat,


394
0:14:21,99 --> 0:14:23,34
you're supposed to keep the food
in your stomach.


395
0:14:23,34 --> 0:14:28,138
That was one time!


396
0:14:28,138 --> 0:14:34,11
Here we go.


397
0:14:34,11 --> 0:14:35,311
Hit it!


398
0:14:35,311 --> 0:14:36,345
Almost.


399
0:14:36,345 --> 0:14:37,913
Wow.


400
0:14:37,913 --> 0:14:40,382
Yah!
Come on.


401
0:14:40,382 --> 0:14:42,17
Go.


402
0:14:42,17 --> 0:14:44,52
Go!


403
0:14:44,52 --> 0:14:45,454
Whoa!


404
0:14:45,454 --> 0:14:47,856
Get him!
Take him down!


405
0:14:47,856 --> 0:14:48,79
Almost, almost.


406
0:14:48,79 --> 0:14:50,725
Watch out!
What's going on?


407
0:14:50,725 --> 0:14:53,394
Kevin's in a heated battle
with some guy named the tin man.


408
0:14:53,394 --> 0:14:55,62
Go.
Come on.


409
0:14:55,62 --> 0:14:56,697
That's how you do it.


410
0:14:56,697 --> 0:14:58,999
Little bit of that backswing;
That's it.


411
0:14:58,999 --> 0:15:2,35
That's right.


412
0:15:2,35 --> 0:15:6,572
Man, you gonna dress
like Serena, play like Serena!


413
0:15:6,572 --> 0:15:8,173
Oh!


414
0:15:8,173 --> 0:15:9,141
Whoo!


415
0:15:9,141 --> 0:15:10,175
Ah ha ha!


416
0:15:10,175 --> 0:15:11,176
My man.


417
0:15:11,176 --> 0:15:12,144
That's my boy.


418
0:15:12,144 --> 0:15:15,313
You cannot be serious.


419
0:15:15,313 --> 0:15:16,314
Who's the man?


420
0:15:16,314 --> 0:15:17,348
Me!


421
0:15:17,348 --> 0:15:18,349
You the man.


422
0:15:18,349 --> 0:15:19,317
Look at my boy.


423
0:15:19,317 --> 0:15:22,253
Right there!


424
0:15:22,253 --> 0:15:26,522
Tin man, you were so close.


425
0:15:26,522 --> 0:15:27,523
I'm sorry.


426
0:15:27,523 --> 0:15:33,293
I'm hungry.


427
0:15:33,293 --> 0:15:34,294
Way to go, man,


428
0:15:34,294 --> 0:15:36,43
looking like Andre Agassi
out there.


429
0:15:36,43 --> 0:15:38,164
Thank you
for not embarrassing me.


430
0:15:38,164 --> 0:15:39,332
Shut up.


431
0:15:39,332 --> 0:15:40,366
Ice cream.


432
0:15:40,366 --> 0:15:41,701
What y'all celebrating?


433
0:15:41,701 --> 0:15:44,636
Kevin just won
his online tennis tournament.


434
0:15:44,636 --> 0:15:47,72
Yep, I finally took down
the tin man.


435
0:15:47,72 --> 0:15:48,14
Wait, wait, wait.


436
0:15:48,14 --> 0:15:51,378
Wow! You know what?
That's great.


437
0:15:51,378 --> 0:15:52,379
Got to go!


438
0:15:52,379 --> 0:15:53,38
Bye.
Bye.


439
0:15:53,38 --> 0:15:54,915
You got beat by a child.


440
0:15:54,915 --> 0:15:59,325
You suck it up.


441
0:15:59,325 --> 0:16:9,529
[telephone ringing]


442
0:16:9,529 --> 0:16:10,63
Hello?


443
0:16:10,63 --> 0:16:11,864
Yeah, hello, man,


444
0:16:11,864 --> 0:16:13,867
this is Mr. Hartwell
from the collection agency.


445
0:16:13,867 --> 0:16:15,1
Can I speak to Miss Kingston?


446
0:16:15,1 --> 0:16:17,47
This is Mr. Kingston-Persons.


447
0:16:17,47 --> 0:16:18,571
All right, right.


448
0:16:18,571 --> 0:16:19,972
So this a courtesy call
to confirm


449
0:16:19,972 --> 0:16:21,507
we received
your wife's payment,


450
0:16:21,507 --> 0:16:23,209
and it's gonna be reflected
in our records


451
0:16:23,209 --> 0:16:25,279
by the end of business today.


452
0:16:25,279 --> 0:16:27,148
Payment for how much?


453
0:16:27,148 --> 0:16:31,86
$15,000.
$15,000.


454
0:16:31,86 --> 0:16:33,253
Thank you.


455
0:16:33,253 --> 0:16:34,687
Ain't this about a--


456
0:16:34,687 --> 0:16:35,687
yo, dude.


457
0:16:35,687 --> 0:16:45,361
I'm still here, man.


458
0:16:45,361 --> 0:16:48,43
You know,
when I first met you,


459
0:16:48,43 --> 0:16:51,333
I had no idea
that I was looking at the man


460
0:16:51,333 --> 0:16:52,834
who would prove to me


461
0:16:52,834 --> 0:16:55,469
that there are real men
out there.


462
0:16:55,469 --> 0:16:56,87
Really?


463
0:16:56,87 --> 0:16:58,672
Mm-hmm.


464
0:16:58,672 --> 0:17:0,607
You know what I was thinking?


465
0:17:0,607 --> 0:17:1,708
I was thinking that maybe


466
0:17:1,708 --> 0:17:4,144
we should go back down
to that dealership


467
0:17:4,144 --> 0:17:7,379
and see what kind of good deal
they can give us on that car.


468
0:17:7,379 --> 0:17:9,181
Really?


469
0:17:9,181 --> 0:17:10,849
You would do that for me.


470
0:17:10,849 --> 0:17:13,451
Yes, because I love you,


471
0:17:13,451 --> 0:17:18,188
and it takes money
to make money, right?


472
0:17:18,188 --> 0:17:21,491
Right, right.


473
0:17:21,491 --> 0:17:23,192
Oh, that's good.


474
0:17:23,192 --> 0:17:24,626
Um...


475
0:17:24,626 --> 0:17:28,263
Did you get that business with
the credit report cleared up?


476
0:17:28,263 --> 0:17:30,665
Huh?
The credit report.


477
0:17:30,665 --> 0:17:32,2
Did you get that cleared up?


478
0:17:32,2 --> 0:17:33,434
Oh.


479
0:17:33,434 --> 0:17:34,902
[Laughs]


480
0:17:34,902 --> 0:17:35,936
Yeah.


481
0:17:35,936 --> 0:17:37,404
It was just a glitch.


482
0:17:37,404 --> 0:17:40,24
But the people on the phone
were very nice.


483
0:17:40,24 --> 0:17:42,508
Oh, I bet they were,


484
0:17:42,508 --> 0:17:46,211
especially after you told them
you'd pay the bill.


485
0:17:46,211 --> 0:17:47,178
Pay the what?


486
0:17:47,178 --> 0:17:48,512
Who?


487
0:17:48,512 --> 0:17:49,647
You.


488
0:17:49,647 --> 0:17:50,614
Yeah, and you're right.


489
0:17:50,614 --> 0:17:52,349
They were very nice.


490
0:17:52,349 --> 0:17:55,118
[Laughs]


491
0:17:55,118 --> 0:17:57,587
Oh, you better
quit playing, Nick.


492
0:17:57,587 --> 0:17:59,889
I have no idea
what you're talking about.


493
0:17:59,889 --> 0:18:2,125
Okay, look.


494
0:18:2,125 --> 0:18:5,694
I got a call today
from the collection agency


495
0:18:5,694 --> 0:18:7,895
saying our credit will be fine


496
0:18:7,895 --> 0:18:13,398
'cause you sent them a check
for $15,000.


497
0:18:13,398 --> 0:18:18,936
So you need to start
explaining yourself.


498
0:18:18,936 --> 0:18:20,204
Damn.


499
0:18:20,204 --> 0:18:23,174
Okay, okay, okay.


500
0:18:23,174 --> 0:18:25,409
But don't be mad at me, okay?


501
0:18:25,409 --> 0:18:26,576
Okay.


502
0:18:26,576 --> 0:18:28,811
But the next time I say
"don't be mad at me,"


503
0:18:28,811 --> 0:18:30,379
you have to not be mad at me.


504
0:18:30,379 --> 0:18:31,814
Deal.


505
0:18:31,814 --> 0:18:36,84
Hold on;
We got to get this on tape.


506
0:18:36,84 --> 0:18:37,219
"I...


507
0:18:37,219 --> 0:18:38,22
I...


508
0:18:38,22 --> 0:18:39,655
"Suzanne Kingston-Persons...


509
0:18:39,655 --> 0:18:41,89
Suzanne Kingston-Persons...


510
0:18:41,89 --> 0:18:43,591
"Being of sound body
and mind...


511
0:18:43,591 --> 0:18:47,961
Being of sound mind and body,
won't be mad, okay?


512
0:18:47,961 --> 0:18:50,965
Start talking.


513
0:18:50,965 --> 0:18:53,1
This is all Frank's fault.


514
0:18:53,1 --> 0:18:55,36
Your ex-husband?


515
0:18:55,36 --> 0:18:56,971
Exactly.


516
0:18:56,971 --> 0:18:58,239
Okay.


517
0:18:58,239 --> 0:19:0,607
We always argued about money,


518
0:19:0,607 --> 0:19:3,575
and I just never felt like
Frank had my back,


519
0:19:3,575 --> 0:19:5,51
and I didn't want to use
his money


520
0:19:5,51 --> 0:19:8,12
to pay back my student loans.


521
0:19:8,12 --> 0:19:11,415
So, you know, then I was single,


522
0:19:11,415 --> 0:19:14,151
and then it was you and me,
and we moved,


523
0:19:14,151 --> 0:19:16,853
and we got all swept up
in things,


524
0:19:16,853 --> 0:19:18,254
and the next thing I know--


525
0:19:18,254 --> 0:19:20,189
I can't get my car.


526
0:19:20,189 --> 0:19:22,324
So you knew
you owed that money?


527
0:19:22,324 --> 0:19:24,159
No.


528
0:19:24,159 --> 0:19:25,46
Yes.


529
0:19:25,46 --> 0:19:26,928
I forgot.
Wait, wait.


530
0:19:26,928 --> 0:19:32,166
How do you forget
you owe somebody $15,000?


531
0:19:32,166 --> 0:19:33,433
Well, I--


532
0:19:33,433 --> 0:19:34,968
wait, wait.


533
0:19:34,968 --> 0:19:38,4
You know, there's nothing
you can say to explain it.


534
0:19:38,4 --> 0:19:45,443
Where did you get $15,000?


535
0:19:45,443 --> 0:19:48,979
I started saving the money
when I was with Frank.


536
0:19:48,979 --> 0:19:51,848
It was my "one day" money.


537
0:19:51,848 --> 0:19:53,716
What's one day money?


538
0:19:53,716 --> 0:19:56,352
One day,
I'm gonna do something fun


539
0:19:56,352 --> 0:19:58,254
and not care how much it costs.


540
0:19:58,254 --> 0:20:2,558
You should have told me.


541
0:20:2,558 --> 0:20:5,6
Look, I'm not here
to hold you back.


542
0:20:5,6 --> 0:20:7,329
I'm here to have your back.


543
0:20:7,329 --> 0:20:11,5
I got you.


544
0:20:11,5 --> 0:20:14,136
I know.


545
0:20:14,136 --> 0:20:16,505
It'sust that...


546
0:20:16,505 --> 0:20:21,676
Sometimes 's just hard
to really relax.


547
0:20:21,676 --> 0:20:25,779
I'm sorry.


548
0:20:25,779 --> 0:20:28,47
Just to be clear,


549
0:20:28,47 --> 0:20:30,215
do you owe anybody else?


550
0:20:30,215 --> 0:20:32,151
No.


551
0:20:32,151 --> 0:20:33,186
Good.


552
0:20:33,186 --> 0:20:35,155
I love you.


553
0:20:35,155 --> 0:20:43,997
I love you too, babe.


554
0:20:43,997 --> 0:20:46,199
What are you doing?


555
0:20:46,199 --> 0:20:48,401
I'm getting ready for bed.


556
0:20:48,401 --> 0:20:49,744
Take that off.


557
0:20:49,744 --> 0:20:51,254
You're not going to sleep.
