2
0:0:9,13 --> 0:0:10,2
MITT ROMNEY: Drug trafficking.


3
0:0:10,2 --> 0:0:12,2
That's one more of those
areas of concern.


4
0:0:12,2 --> 0:0:14,68
It's time for the United States
of America to take


5
0:0:14,68 --> 0:0:18,59
responsibility for the pain and
suffering and torture and


6
0:0:18,59 --> 0:0:22,9
murder that's going on
throughout Latin America.


7
0:0:22,9 --> 0:0:23,97
SHANE SMITH: Maybe one of the
reasons that Mitt Romney is so


8
0:0:23,97 --> 0:0:26,76
concerned with the drug wars
taking place just south of the


9
0:0:26,76 --> 0:0:30,5
American border is that it
affects him and his family


10
0:0:30,5 --> 0:0:31,32
personally.


11
0:0:31,32 --> 0:0:34,1
Hi, I'm Shane Smith and we're
here at the Vice headquarters


12
0:0:34,1 --> 0:0:35,18
in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.


13
0:0:35,18 --> 0:0:38,12
Now, Williamsburg is ground
zero for hipsters.


14
0:0:38,12 --> 0:0:40,9
Which means it's also ground
zero for partying.


15
0:0:40,9 --> 0:0:44,8
Which means it's ground
zero for cocaine.


16
0:0:44,8 --> 0:0:46,87
Now, Vice has talked a lot about
cocaine over the years.


17
0:0:46,87 --> 0:0:50,75
In fact, one of our magazine
covers featured a mirror with


18
0:0:50,75 --> 0:0:52,36
a big line of coke
chopped up on it.


19
0:0:52,36 --> 0:0:55,78
But recently, we followed a
story that made us think twice


20
0:0:55,78 --> 0:0:58,6
about our historical fascination
with coke.


21
0:0:58,6 --> 0:0:59,8
And it has to do
with Mormons--


22
0:0:59,8 --> 0:1:2,6
as in Mitt Romney's family-type
Mormons--


23
0:1:2,6 --> 0:1:7,48
Mexican drug cartels, polygamy,
kidnapping, cocaine,


24
0:1:7,48 --> 0:1:9,54
and finally, murder.


25
0:1:9,54 --> 0:1:11,5
Now, it's a freaky,
freaky story.


26
0:1:11,5 --> 0:1:14,18
And it's taking place just
south of the US border.


27
0:1:14,18 --> 0:1:16,31
So we went to check it
out firsthand to see


28
0:1:16,31 --> 0:1:17,56
what's going on.


29
0:1:17,56 --> 0:1:22,62



30
0:1:22,62 --> 0:1:25,568
We just passed through from El
Paso, in Texas, which is


31
0:1:25,568 --> 0:1:27,55
actually one of the safest
cities in America, into


32
0:1:27,55 --> 0:1:29,56
Juarez, Mexico, which is
actually one of the most


33
0:1:29,56 --> 0:1:31,0
dangerous cities in the world.


34
0:1:31,0 --> 0:1:33,6
In fact, it's the most dangerous
city in the world


35
0:1:33,6 --> 0:1:34,29
for journalists.


36
0:1:34,29 --> 0:1:36,99
And we're driving with the
camera rolling, which is, in


37
0:1:36,99 --> 0:1:40,87
retrospect, very
fucking stupid.


38
0:1:40,87 --> 0:1:43,551
People always ask me what the
most dangerous place I've ever


39
0:1:43,551 --> 0:1:44,34
been to is.


40
0:1:44,34 --> 0:1:46,27
And when I say Mexico, they're
a bit flummoxed.


41
0:1:46,27 --> 0:1:48,33
And they say, Mexico,
I've been to Mexico.


42
0:1:48,33 --> 0:1:51,3
I've been to Cancun, Joe's
Tequila Foam Party


43
0:1:51,3 --> 0:1:52,63
and Boom Boom Room.


44
0:1:52,63 --> 0:1:55,31
But this Mexico, here in Juarez,
is the Mexico run by


45
0:1:55,31 --> 0:1:56,19
the narco lords.


46
0:1:56,19 --> 0:1:57,81
They don't care about what
you're shooting.


47
0:1:57,81 --> 0:1:59,96
They don't walk up and say, hey,
what's that camera for?


48
0:1:59,96 --> 0:2:2,2
They just see a camera and
go, that can't be good.


49
0:2:2,2 --> 0:2:3,71
And bam.


50
0:2:3,71 --> 0:2:6,32
Now, the drug lords that rule
northern Mexico are like most


51
0:2:6,32 --> 0:2:7,255
mafia around the world.


52
0:2:7,255 --> 0:2:10,199
They're very wealthy, and
they're insanely ruthless.


53
0:2:10,199 --> 0:2:12,52
But the thing that sets the
Mexican cartels apart from the


54
0:2:12,52 --> 0:2:16,205
other mobs is their seemingly
profound love of murder.


55
0:2:16,205 --> 0:2:18,87



56
0:2:18,87 --> 0:2:21,1
They put other crime syndicates
to shame with the


57
0:2:21,1 --> 0:2:23,95
sheer scale of their killing,
not to mention the gruesome,


58
0:2:23,95 --> 0:2:26,81
eye-catching way they present
their murders, with a kind of


59
0:2:26,81 --> 0:2:28,6
evil inventiveness.


60
0:2:28,6 --> 0:2:31,91



61
0:2:31,91 --> 0:2:34,66
And it's not just traditional
gang-on-gang violence, either.


62
0:2:34,66 --> 0:2:37,86
The cartels kill anyone and
everyone in their way.


63
0:2:37,86 --> 0:2:40,2
Rivals, witnesses, journalists,
politicians, and


64
0:2:40,2 --> 0:2:42,14
police are all targets.


65
0:2:42,14 --> 0:2:44,61
And rather than hiding the
bodies like most criminals,


66
0:2:44,61 --> 0:2:46,73
they actually want
you to see them.


67
0:2:46,73 --> 0:2:51,4
And they want you to know
exactly who did it.


68
0:2:51,4 --> 0:2:54,6
In fact, the war on drugs in
Mexico is so violent that its


69
0:2:54,6 --> 0:2:58,39
body count is almost 10 times
that of American soldiers


70
0:2:58,39 --> 0:3:2,75
killed in the real wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan.


71
0:3:2,75 --> 0:3:5,8
And in a country where it's
supposedly illegal to own


72
0:3:5,8 --> 0:3:8,14
guns, the narcos are armed
to the teeth with


73
0:3:8,14 --> 0:3:12,35
state-of-the-art weaponry, 90%
of which are smuggled in from


74
0:3:12,35 --> 0:3:14,66
the United States, which is
something we got to see


75
0:3:14,66 --> 0:3:18,88
firsthand as soon as we
arrived in Juarez.


76
0:3:18,88 --> 0:3:29,48
FORENSICS DEPARTMENT HEAD:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


77
0:3:29,48 --> 0:3:32,16
SHANE SMITH: We came in here,
and we saw this huge bunker.


78
0:3:32,16 --> 0:3:35,57
And we're like, oh, this is
where they hold all the guns


79
0:3:35,57 --> 0:3:37,98
and all the drugs and
everything, in this big,


80
0:3:37,98 --> 0:3:39,19
massive concrete bunker.


81
0:3:39,19 --> 0:3:39,94
And they're like, no, no.


82
0:3:39,94 --> 0:3:42,9
The drugs and the guns are
here in the trucks.


83
0:3:42,9 --> 0:3:43,925
That's a nightclub called
The Sphinx.


84
0:3:43,925 --> 0:3:46,79



85
0:3:46,79 --> 0:3:50,84
So last night, the police caught
these guys trying to


86
0:3:50,84 --> 0:3:55,51
smuggle in 268,000 rounds of
ammunition in a truck with


87
0:3:55,51 --> 0:3:56,66
Oklahoma plates.


88
0:3:56,66 --> 0:3:59,59
It was driven by a
guy from Dallas.


89
0:3:59,59 --> 0:4:3,12
Over a quarter of a million
rounds of ammunition.


90
0:4:3,12 --> 0:4:4,58
This is the kind of firepower
that they have.


91
0:4:4,58 --> 0:4:13,86



92
0:4:13,86 --> 0:4:17,25
This is a 30-caliber Browning,
which shoots super fast and


93
0:4:17,25 --> 0:4:19,63
can shoot through
armored cars.


94
0:4:19,63 --> 0:4:21,97
And then they have this
antiaircraft .50 cal.


95
0:4:21,97 --> 0:4:24,2
Can I pick it up?


96
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:24,77
SHANE SMITH: Shit, I did.


97
0:4:24,77 --> 0:4:25,99
I put my finger on it.


98
0:4:25,99 --> 0:4:27,73
I'm going to get in trouble.


99
0:4:27,73 --> 0:4:30,2
They just confiscated
these weapons, and I


100
0:4:30,2 --> 0:4:31,64
touched the .50 cal.


101
0:4:31,64 --> 0:4:33,15
And they haven't dusted
them for prints yet.


102
0:4:33,15 --> 0:4:35,59
So now my prints are
on a murder weapon.


103
0:4:35,59 --> 0:4:37,39
Not good.


104
0:4:37,39 --> 0:4:44,2
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


105
0:4:44,2 --> 0:4:46,11
SHANE SMITH: These look like
they're from America.


106
0:4:46,11 --> 0:4:47,595
America America, America.


107
0:4:47,595 --> 0:4:48,91
All the guns are from America.


108
0:4:48,91 --> 0:4:50,21
They're all homicides
[INAUDIBLE].


109
0:4:50,21 --> 0:4:51,53
They've tested them out?


110
0:4:51,53 --> 0:4:54,82
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


111
0:4:54,82 --> 0:4:57,405
SHANE SMITH: Oh, sorry.


112
0:4:57,405 --> 0:4:59,265
[GUNSHOTS]


113
0:4:59,265 --> 0:5:1,59
SHANE SMITH: That was loud.


114
0:5:1,59 --> 0:5:3,29
It smells very strong.


115
0:5:3,29 --> 0:5:4,17
Holy Jesus.


116
0:5:4,17 --> 0:5:7,15
I knows this doesn't look like
crazy, but you can smell, wow.


117
0:5:7,15 --> 0:5:9,6
It's a lot of drugs.


118
0:5:9,6 --> 0:5:11,86
Drugs and flak jackets.


119
0:5:11,86 --> 0:5:15,21
So this is sort of a rustic
type of smuggling called a


120
0:5:15,21 --> 0:5:16,585
burrero, which is
like a donkey.


121
0:5:16,585 --> 0:5:18,91
And they just walk through
the desert with the


122
0:5:18,91 --> 0:5:21,53
pot on their back.


123
0:5:21,53 --> 0:5:23,92
So the market for the
drugs is America.


124
0:5:23,92 --> 0:5:27,2
The market for the weapons
is here in Mexico.


125
0:5:27,2 --> 0:5:29,52
And they go like this.


126
0:5:29,52 --> 0:5:33,15
But when you look at this-- like
.50 cals, assault rifles,


127
0:5:33,15 --> 0:5:35,19
military-grade machine guns--


128
0:5:35,19 --> 0:5:38,45
you realize, OK, how do the
police fight them, let alone


129
0:5:38,45 --> 0:5:40,26
regular people, let alone
Mormons, who aren't


130
0:5:40,26 --> 0:5:41,835
allowed to own guns?


131
0:5:41,835 --> 0:5:43,85
It's crazy.


132
0:5:43,85 --> 0:5:45,76



133
0:5:45,76 --> 0:5:49,4
So we're about 200 miles south
of Juarez now, and we're out


134
0:5:49,4 --> 0:5:50,49
in the middle of nowhere.


135
0:5:50,49 --> 0:5:52,47
This is the narco
superhighway.


136
0:5:52,47 --> 0:5:55,13
There's actually 300 different
smuggling trails


137
0:5:55,13 --> 0:5:55,93
right through here.


138
0:5:55,93 --> 0:5:57,15
There's no big wall
or anything.


139
0:5:57,15 --> 0:5:59,43
You can just walk off into
the desert with your


140
0:5:59,43 --> 0:6:0,7
pack full of cocaine.


141
0:6:0,7 --> 0:6:2,7
And then all of a sudden,
coke's in Williamsburg.


142
0:6:2,7 --> 0:6:6,17
And hipsters are doing coke.


143
0:6:6,17 --> 0:6:8,73
As you're out here, it kind of
dawns on you that there's


144
0:6:8,73 --> 0:6:9,48
nowhere to go.


145
0:6:9,48 --> 0:6:12,76
Like if something happens, or
if someone even chases us,


146
0:6:12,76 --> 0:6:14,34
where are we going to run to?


147
0:6:14,34 --> 0:6:16,135
Because you can't trust
the police.


148
0:6:16,135 --> 0:6:18,26
You especially can't trust the
local police because they're


149
0:6:18,26 --> 0:6:19,29
all corrupt.


150
0:6:19,29 --> 0:6:23,38
So basically right now, it's a
straight shot to the Mormons,


151
0:6:23,38 --> 0:6:25,5
their guns, and their God.


152
0:6:25,5 --> 0:6:40,78



153
0:6:40,78 --> 0:6:43,33
MITT ROMNEY: My dad had been
born in Mexico, and his family


154
0:6:43,33 --> 0:6:45,44
had to leave during the
Mexican revolution.


155
0:6:45,44 --> 0:6:47,7
He had big dreams.


156
0:6:47,7 --> 0:6:48,91
We were Mormons.


157
0:6:48,91 --> 0:6:51,54
And growing up in Michigan, that
might have seemed unusual


158
0:6:51,54 --> 0:6:52,4
or out of place.


159
0:6:52,4 --> 0:6:55,2
But I really don't remember
it that way.


160
0:6:55,2 --> 0:6:57,66
My friends cared more about what
sports teams we followed


161
0:6:57,66 --> 0:6:59,13
than what church we went to.


162
0:6:59,13 --> 0:7:4,38



163
0:7:4,38 --> 0:7:6,36
SHANE SMITH: So we're on our
way down here to colonial


164
0:7:6,36 --> 0:7:9,63
Juarez, which is in northern
Mexico, in Chihuahua state.


165
0:7:9,63 --> 0:7:13,25
A lot of people may know that
Romney and his family are


166
0:7:13,25 --> 0:7:14,27
actually from here.


167
0:7:14,27 --> 0:7:17,31
His father was actually born
here in a Mormon colony.


168
0:7:17,31 --> 0:7:19,73
But maybe what they don't know
is that these Mormon colonies


169
0:7:19,73 --> 0:7:23,16
are still here, and they're
actually fighting the narco


170
0:7:23,16 --> 0:7:26,15
cartels, the drug cartels, that
run this whole region.


171
0:7:26,15 --> 0:7:27,44
They're standing up, and
they're fighting the


172
0:7:27,44 --> 0:7:30,39
kidnapping and the violence
and the crime.


173
0:7:30,39 --> 0:7:33,1
So the question is, what are
the Mormons doing down in


174
0:7:33,1 --> 0:7:36,99
Mexico in the first place?


175
0:7:36,99 --> 0:7:41,1
Mormons originally came down to
Mexico in the late 1800s,


176
0:7:41,1 --> 0:7:43,75
after the American government
forced the Mormon church to


177
0:7:43,75 --> 0:7:44,85
ban polygamy.


178
0:7:44,85 --> 0:7:48,11
The problem with this is that
Joseph Smith, the prophet of


179
0:7:48,11 --> 0:7:51,24
the religion, held that polygamy
was actually a divine


180
0:7:51,24 --> 0:7:51,98
commandment.


181
0:7:51,98 --> 0:7:54,97
He believed that you can only
reach the highest level of the


182
0:7:54,97 --> 0:7:58,73
celestial kingdom, or heaven, if
you were actually a partner


183
0:7:58,73 --> 0:7:59,48
in a plural marriage.


184
0:7:59,48 --> 0:8:2,16
So basically, the more wives
you had, the better


185
0:8:2,16 --> 0:8:3,28
heaven would be.


186
0:8:3,28 --> 0:8:6,145
And rather than give up their
place in heaven, many moved


187
0:8:6,145 --> 0:8:9,73
down to Mexico to continue to
practice polygamy, and thereby


188
0:8:9,73 --> 0:8:12,9
assure their place
in the afterlife.


189
0:8:12,9 --> 0:8:15,1
Here in the seclusion of the
Mexican desert, they could


190
0:8:15,1 --> 0:8:18,22
practice all the standard Mormon
rituals like baptizing


191
0:8:18,22 --> 0:8:21,26
the dead or wearing magic
underwear, but also the more


192
0:8:21,26 --> 0:8:22,95
controversial plural marriage.


193
0:8:22,95 --> 0:8:26,18
Or, as we were soon to find
out, the outright insane


194
0:8:26,18 --> 0:8:28,66
practice of blood atonement.


195
0:8:28,66 --> 0:8:31,97
So after about five hours of
some very nervous driving and


196
0:8:31,97 --> 0:8:35,49
a couple of very thorough stops
at military checkpoints,


197
0:8:35,49 --> 0:8:37,52
not to mention two stops at
drive-through liquor stores to


198
0:8:37,52 --> 0:8:41,179
calm our very jangling nerves,
we finally arrived at the


199
0:8:41,179 --> 0:8:42,239
Mormon promised land.


200
0:8:42,239 --> 0:8:48,59
[MUSIC - "PRAISE TO THE MAN"]


201
0:8:48,59 --> 0:8:51,37
SHANE SMITH: We left Juarez,
which is very dirty and poor


202
0:8:51,37 --> 0:8:52,94
and very druggy.


203
0:8:52,94 --> 0:8:55,27
And then all of a sudden,
you come over this hill.


204
0:8:55,27 --> 0:8:57,25
And there's orchards
and golf courses.


205
0:8:57,25 --> 0:8:58,7
And the streets are
laid out nice.


206
0:8:58,7 --> 0:8:59,48
They've got nice schools.


207
0:8:59,48 --> 0:9:0,37
Kids are playing baseball.


208
0:9:0,37 --> 0:9:1,44
And there's angels.


209
0:9:1,44 --> 0:9:3,59
And It's kind of like,
[SINGS HEAVENLY REFRAIN]--


210
0:9:3,59 --> 0:9:5,17
you know, we've come
to God's country.


211
0:9:5,17 --> 0:9:8,14
Because it's beautiful here and
they obviously have money.


212
0:9:8,14 --> 0:9:10,2
So this is why they're being
targeted by the narcos.


213
0:9:10,2 --> 0:9:11,68
And this is why they
have to fight back.


214
0:9:11,68 --> 0:9:13,88
So now we're going to go meet
some Mormons who are actually


215
0:9:13,88 --> 0:9:15,19
fighting the narco cartel.


216
0:9:15,19 --> 0:9:20,98



217
0:9:20,98 --> 0:9:22,65
This is Brent LeBaron's farm.


218
0:9:22,65 --> 0:9:26,75
They are sort of famously
secretive about their weapons,


219
0:9:26,75 --> 0:9:28,78
their fighting, because they
don't want to be targeted


220
0:9:28,78 --> 0:9:30,14
anymore by the cartels.


221
0:9:30,14 --> 0:9:31,27
But we're going to go
meet him and see if


222
0:9:31,27 --> 0:9:32,52
he'll show us around.


223
0:9:32,52 --> 0:9:34,83



224
0:9:34,83 --> 0:9:35,5
Brent?


225
0:9:35,5 --> 0:9:36,45
BRENT LABARON: Yeah,
how's it going?


226
0:9:36,45 --> 0:9:37,6
SHANE SMITH: Shane Smith.


227
0:9:37,6 --> 0:9:37,9
BRENT LABARON: Brent LeBaron.


228
0:9:37,9 --> 0:9:38,69
Nice to meet you.


229
0:9:38,69 --> 0:9:39,11
SHANE SMITH: Nice to meet you.


230
0:9:39,11 --> 0:9:39,54
How you doing?


231
0:9:39,54 --> 0:9:40,6
BRENT LABARON: I'm
very, very well.


232
0:9:40,6 --> 0:9:41,89
SHANE SMITH: This
is your farm.


233
0:9:41,89 --> 0:9:42,47
BRENT LABARON: This
is my farm.


234
0:9:42,47 --> 0:9:45,46
We farm chili and a little
bit of wheat.


235
0:9:45,46 --> 0:9:47,55
All depends the time
of the season.


236
0:9:47,55 --> 0:9:50,2
SHANE SMITH: We've heard that
the LeBaron family, the


237
0:9:50,2 --> 0:9:53,28
LeBaron colony, has sort of been
standing up to some of


238
0:9:53,28 --> 0:9:54,66
the narco cartels.


239
0:9:54,66 --> 0:9:56,2
BRENT LABARON: Yeah.


240
0:9:56,2 --> 0:9:59,14
We've had a few run-ins
with them.


241
0:9:59,14 --> 0:10:2,69
Don't like to say too much about
them, but I'd love to


242
0:10:2,69 --> 0:10:3,44
show you around.


243
0:10:3,44 --> 0:10:4,24
Let's go.


244
0:10:4,24 --> 0:10:5,27
SHANE SMITH: Let's do it.


245
0:10:5,27 --> 0:10:7,68
Now, I didn't know what to
expect when I first met Brent.


246
0:10:7,68 --> 0:10:9,13
And when I did, he
seemed to me more


247
0:10:9,13 --> 0:10:10,61
American than most Americans.


248
0:10:10,61 --> 0:10:12,6
In fact, I wouldn't have been
surprised if he told me he


249
0:10:12,6 --> 0:10:14,51
played linebacker for Alabama.


250
0:10:14,51 --> 0:10:17,47
But when he started to give me
the tour around the cemetery,


251
0:10:17,47 --> 0:10:20,66
I realized that his story
was anything but normal.


252
0:10:20,66 --> 0:10:23,18
BRENT LABARON: This is the
graveyard where my grandfather


253
0:10:23,18 --> 0:10:27,5
and great grandfather
are buried.


254
0:10:27,5 --> 0:10:29,71
The original story is they come
down for the cause of


255
0:10:29,71 --> 0:10:31,54
plural marriage,
to continue it.


256
0:10:31,54 --> 0:10:32,96
You know, Mexico allowed it.


257
0:10:32,96 --> 0:10:35,12
SHANE SMITH: So they wanted
to continue polygamy.


258
0:10:35,12 --> 0:10:35,73
BRENT LABARON: Yes.


259
0:10:35,73 --> 0:10:38,67
My great grandfather, being a
fundamentalist, he broke away


260
0:10:38,67 --> 0:10:41,26
from the Mormon church because
he had two wives.


261
0:10:41,26 --> 0:10:43,465
That's when he went to establish
Colonia LeBaron.


262
0:10:43,465 --> 0:10:47,13
They established five or
six colonies down here.


263
0:10:47,13 --> 0:10:48,69
SHANE SMITH: A colony would
be like a family.


264
0:10:48,69 --> 0:10:49,74
BRENT LABARON: A few families.


265
0:10:49,74 --> 0:10:50,35
SHANE SMITH: Right.


266
0:10:50,35 --> 0:10:53,14
And then your grandfather
had 10 wives.


267
0:10:53,14 --> 0:10:53,67
BRENT LABARON: Yes.


268
0:10:53,67 --> 0:10:56,24
Had children by 8 of
those 10, but yes.


269
0:10:56,24 --> 0:10:57,65
SHANE SMITH: And how many
grand kids did he have?


270
0:10:57,65 --> 0:10:59,52
BRENT LABARON: Between grand
kids and great grand kids,


271
0:10:59,52 --> 0:11:2,1
they're probably pushing
the 400 mark right now.


272
0:11:2,1 --> 0:11:2,48
SHANE SMITH: Wow.


273
0:11:2,48 --> 0:11:3,25
All named LeBaron.


274
0:11:3,25 --> 0:11:4,445
BRENT LABARON: All
named LeBaron.


275
0:11:4,445 --> 0:11:7,68
SHANE SMITH: Now, having more
than 400 grandchildren might


276
0:11:7,68 --> 0:11:8,98
seem extreme to some.


277
0:11:8,98 --> 0:11:12,37
But it's nothing compared to
the shit that Brent's uncle


278
0:11:12,37 --> 0:11:13,3
Ervil got up to.


279
0:11:13,3 --> 0:11:17,57
He was a straight up
fucking lunatic.


280
0:11:17,57 --> 0:11:22,13
Now, Ervil not only had 13 wives
and over 50 children,


281
0:11:22,13 --> 0:11:24,55
but he also used own family,
including his


282
0:11:24,55 --> 0:11:27,72
own kids, as assassins.


283
0:11:27,72 --> 0:11:30,42
Dubbed "the Mormon Manson,"
Ervil and his family were


284
0:11:30,42 --> 0:11:32,84
suspects in over 40 murders.


285
0:11:32,84 --> 0:11:34,95
SHANE SMITH: Joel LeBaron was
killed by his own brother,


286
0:11:34,95 --> 0:11:37,7
Ervil, because of
blood atonement.


287
0:11:37,7 --> 0:11:37,44
BRENT LABARON: Yes.


288
0:11:37,44 --> 0:11:40,26
Well, Ervil tried to take over
the church, and he started


289
0:11:40,26 --> 0:11:42,86
claiming blood atonement,
the right to kill


290
0:11:42,86 --> 0:11:43,65
in the name of God.


291
0:11:43,65 --> 0:11:47,9
If you oppose him, he has
the right to kill you.


292
0:11:47,9 --> 0:11:49,96
Once Ervil snapped, he just
went on a killing spree.


293
0:11:49,96 --> 0:11:52,54
He had his daughters
killed, his wives


294
0:11:52,54 --> 0:11:54,69
killed, his sons killed.


295
0:11:54,69 --> 0:11:56,24
And it just went from there.


296
0:11:56,24 --> 0:11:57,81
He went haywire.


297
0:11:57,81 --> 0:12:0,22
SHANE SMITH: So Ervil goes on
this killing spree across


298
0:12:0,22 --> 0:12:2,18
Mexico and the United States.


299
0:12:2,18 --> 0:12:4,89
And at one point, the Secret
Service is after him because


300
0:12:4,89 --> 0:12:7,26
he threatens to kill
President Carter.


301
0:12:7,26 --> 0:12:11,17
They finally captured Ervil in
1979 and sent him to prison.


302
0:12:11,17 --> 0:12:13,0
And all the killing
stops, right?


303
0:12:13,0 --> 0:12:13,96
Wrong.


304
0:12:13,96 --> 0:12:17,9
SHANE SMITH: And then after he
dies in jail, people keep on


305
0:12:17,9 --> 0:12:18,6
killing for him.


306
0:12:18,6 --> 0:12:21,6
BRENT LABARON: He killed up
to 25 people after he died


307
0:12:21,6 --> 0:12:23,56
because he left a sort of hit
list, and they kept killing.


308
0:12:23,56 --> 0:12:24,3
SHANE SMITH: They
kept killing?


309
0:12:24,3 --> 0:12:24,82
BRENT LABARON: Yes.


310
0:12:24,82 --> 0:12:25,35
They did.


311
0:12:25,35 --> 0:12:27,16
SHANE SMITH: Now, as Brent is
telling me all this, I had to


312
0:12:27,16 --> 0:12:30,29
keep in mind that this blood
atonement killing spree isn't


313
0:12:30,29 --> 0:12:32,64
taking place in the
1880s or anything.


314
0:12:32,64 --> 0:12:35,41
This is all happening
in the 1980s.


315
0:12:35,41 --> 0:12:36,82
BRENT LABARON: My grandfather
ran from him


316
0:12:36,82 --> 0:12:38,72
for probably 10 years.


317
0:12:38,72 --> 0:12:41,1
I mean, he chased my grandpa
clear to Nicaragua.


318
0:12:41,1 --> 0:12:43,98
SHANE SMITH: Your great uncle
was trying to kill your


319
0:12:43,98 --> 0:12:44,235
grandfather.


320
0:12:44,235 --> 0:12:45,202
BRENT LABARON: Yeah.


321
0:12:45,202 --> 0:12:47,92
Verlan M. LeBaron died in a
car accident right out of


322
0:12:47,92 --> 0:12:48,87
Mexico City.


323
0:12:48,87 --> 0:12:52,27
A lot of people have been
skeptical that actually Ervil


324
0:12:52,27 --> 0:12:53,68
had something to do with it.


325
0:12:53,68 --> 0:12:58,13
And his last recorded words
were, brother, it looks like


326
0:12:58,13 --> 0:12:59,72
we've been ran off the road.


327
0:12:59,72 --> 0:13:0,22
SHANE SMITH: Wow.


328
0:13:0,22 --> 0:13:1,72
That's some crazy shit.


329
0:13:1,72 --> 0:13:2,63
BRENT LABARON: Yeah.


330
0:13:2,63 --> 0:13:6,16
It's just a modern day
Cain and Abel here.


331
0:13:6,16 --> 0:13:8,4
SHANE SMITH: Do you think that
that's one of the reasons why?


332
0:13:8,4 --> 0:13:11,15
Because you had this sort of
familial civil war you got


333
0:13:11,15 --> 0:13:14,24
tighter as a family, So when
the narcos came after your


334
0:13:14,24 --> 0:13:15,74
family, you were sort
of tougher?


335
0:13:15,74 --> 0:13:16,94
BRENT LABARON: Oh, definitely.


336
0:13:16,94 --> 0:13:19,61
Everyone was a watchman.


337
0:13:19,61 --> 0:13:21,51
SHANE SMITH: Now, what he's
saying here is that because of


338
0:13:21,51 --> 0:13:25,0
Ervil, everyone in the LeBaron
clan watched out


339
0:13:25,0 --> 0:13:25,86
for everyone else.


340
0:13:25,86 --> 0:13:27,87
So when the cartels kidnapped
one of their


341
0:13:27,87 --> 0:13:30,33
own, they were ready.


342
0:13:30,33 --> 0:13:34,86
Eric LeBaron was only 16 when
he was abducted and held for


343
0:13:34,86 --> 0:13:37,2
$1 million ransom.


344
0:13:37,2 --> 0:13:38,28
You didn't pay the ransom.


345
0:13:38,28 --> 0:13:39,89
BRENT LABARON: We didn't
pay the ransom.


346
0:13:39,89 --> 0:13:41,7
SHANE SMITH: Even if you could
get the money and paid it,


347
0:13:41,7 --> 0:13:42,69
they're just going
to keep doing it.


348
0:13:42,69 --> 0:13:43,83
BRENT LABARON: They're just
going to keep coming


349
0:13:43,83 --> 0:13:44,55
and keep doing it.


350
0:13:44,55 --> 0:13:46,6
SHANE SMITH: They'll just use
the money to buy more guns and


351
0:13:46,6 --> 0:13:47,73
get more powerful.


352
0:13:47,73 --> 0:13:48,53
BRENT LABARON: Exactly.


353
0:13:48,53 --> 0:13:51,64
If we don't sever the head off
this monster right now, it's


354
0:13:51,64 --> 0:13:52,8
just going to get worse.


355
0:13:52,8 --> 0:13:55,33
We had to go to the government
and say, hey.


356
0:13:55,33 --> 0:13:57,49
You won't allow us
to bear arms.


357
0:13:57,49 --> 0:14:0,2
But you're supposed
to protect us.


358
0:14:0,2 --> 0:14:1,93
SHANE SMITH: The protest forced
the government to put


359
0:14:1,93 --> 0:14:3,52
pressure on the kidnappers.


360
0:14:3,52 --> 0:14:6,47
And as is quite rare in these
situations, Eric was returned


361
0:14:6,47 --> 0:14:9,5
unharmed after paying
no ransom.


362
0:14:9,5 --> 0:14:12,85
However, it also served to
enrage the local drug Lord,


363
0:14:12,85 --> 0:14:15,37
named "El Rikin," who only lived
eight miles down the


364
0:14:15,37 --> 0:14:17,74
road from Colonia LeBaron.


365
0:14:17,74 --> 0:14:21,185
Now, this is a narco who loves
drugs so much that he actually


366
0:14:21,185 --> 0:14:24,71
massacred 18 people trying to
get off the stuff at a drug


367
0:14:24,71 --> 0:14:25,555
rehab center.


368
0:14:25,555 --> 0:14:27,945
And now, he's after
the LeBarons.


369
0:14:27,945 --> 0:14:35,49



370
0:14:35,49 --> 0:14:37,31
NEWS ANCHOR 1: Two more
Americans dead as a result of


371
0:14:37,31 --> 0:14:38,74
the violence in Mexico.


372
0:14:38,74 --> 0:14:42,47
Those victims gunned down this
week by drug cartel killers.


373
0:14:42,47 --> 0:14:44,54
NEWS ANCHOR 2: We've done a lot
of stories about polygamy


374
0:14:44,54 --> 0:14:47,57
and a lot of stories about
Mexican drug cartel violence.


375
0:14:47,57 --> 0:14:50,55
But we never imagined the two
topics would mesh like this in


376
0:14:50,55 --> 0:14:51,92
a very tragic way.


377
0:14:51,92 --> 0:14:55,77



378
0:14:55,77 --> 0:14:57,58
SHANE SMITH: The freeing of
one of their own by the


379
0:14:57,58 --> 0:15:0,56
LeBarons protesting in Chihuahua
had sent a message


380
0:15:0,56 --> 0:15:1,6
to the narcos.


381
0:15:1,6 --> 0:15:3,15
They weren't going
to back down.


382
0:15:3,15 --> 0:15:4,39
They weren't going to submit.


383
0:15:4,39 --> 0:15:5,32
They were going to fight.


384
0:15:5,32 --> 0:15:7,25
But it didn't take "El
Rikin" long to send a


385
0:15:7,25 --> 0:15:8,5
message right back.


386
0:15:8,5 --> 0:15:15,376



387
0:15:15,376 --> 0:15:18,75
BRENT LABARON: So yeah, this is
my cousin Benjamin's home.


388
0:15:18,75 --> 0:15:22,76
This "Rikin" guy actually
ordered the hit on him because


389
0:15:22,76 --> 0:15:24,44
of the stand we took.


390
0:15:24,44 --> 0:15:26,39
He was a serious criminal.


391
0:15:26,39 --> 0:15:29,57
I mean, famously, he got caught
on the American side of


392
0:15:29,57 --> 0:15:33,4
the border dressed as Mexican
military, had a shootout with


393
0:15:33,4 --> 0:15:34,62
the border guards, and
then came back here.


394
0:15:34,62 --> 0:15:37,41



395
0:15:37,41 --> 0:15:39,6
So they came here
to his house.


396
0:15:39,6 --> 0:15:45,12



397
0:15:45,12 --> 0:15:49,1
He showed up with 15, 20 guys,
two, three trucks--


398
0:15:49,1 --> 0:15:50,1
pickups.


399
0:15:50,1 --> 0:15:52,61
Benjamin and his family were
sleeping in the house when


400
0:15:52,61 --> 0:15:55,52
these guys come, surround the
house, breaking down his door.


401
0:15:55,52 --> 0:15:58,58
Ended up breaking pretty much
most of his windows out.


402
0:15:58,58 --> 0:16:1,83
There's still marks on the door
where they were trying to


403
0:16:1,83 --> 0:16:3,86
bash in with guns, whatever
they had.


404
0:16:3,86 --> 0:16:6,13
You know, those are sledgehammer
marks.


405
0:16:6,13 --> 0:16:9,18
And at that point, they had
threatened his family with a


406
0:16:9,18 --> 0:16:9,92
hand grenade.


407
0:16:9,92 --> 0:16:11,27
SHANE SMITH: So they said they'd
blow up the family with


408
0:16:11,27 --> 0:16:12,95
a grenade unless
he surrendered?


409
0:16:12,95 --> 0:16:13,91
BRENT LABARON: Unless
he opened the door.


410
0:16:13,91 --> 0:16:15,41
And so he opened the door.


411
0:16:15,41 --> 0:16:18,24
At that point, his
brother-in-law Luis come over


412
0:16:18,24 --> 0:16:19,49
to see what was going on.


413
0:16:19,49 --> 0:16:21,32
He literally showed
up in sandals.


414
0:16:21,32 --> 0:16:22,23
He came to the rescue.


415
0:16:22,23 --> 0:16:23,55
He was an innocent bystander.


416
0:16:23,55 --> 0:16:26,86
SHANE SMITH: So he came here
barefoot with no gun.


417
0:16:26,86 --> 0:16:27,21
BRENT LABARON: At all.


418
0:16:27,21 --> 0:16:28,98
SHANE SMITH: Against guys who
are armed with machine guns


419
0:16:28,98 --> 0:16:29,435
and grenades.


420
0:16:29,435 --> 0:16:29,7
BRENT LABARON: Yes.


421
0:16:29,7 --> 0:16:36,9
But they beat him and picked him
and Benjamin up and took


422
0:16:36,9 --> 0:16:39,86
them about two miles down the
road here and shot them both


423
0:16:39,86 --> 0:16:41,646
and left them on the
side of the road.


424
0:16:41,646 --> 0:16:42,48
SHANE SMITH: Jesus.


425
0:16:42,48 --> 0:16:46,85
So because "El Rikin" put the
hit out on Benjamin, it put


426
0:16:46,85 --> 0:16:49,83
enough domestic pressure here
that they would offer him up


427
0:16:49,83 --> 0:16:52,37
to the American authorities for
the Mexican incident where


428
0:16:52,37 --> 0:16:54,4
he was dressed as the military
with the border police.


429
0:16:54,4 --> 0:16:55,77
BRENT LABARON: Very much so.


430
0:16:55,77 --> 0:16:56,59
Very much so, yeah.


431
0:16:56,59 --> 0:16:59,38
Because I don't think they had
enough here to hold him here.


432
0:16:59,38 --> 0:17:1,76
So they actually shipped
him to the US.


433
0:17:1,76 --> 0:17:3,59
SHANE SMITH: And although "El
Rikin" was extradited to


434
0:17:3,59 --> 0:17:6,74
America for his firefights with
the border patrol, none


435
0:17:6,74 --> 0:17:9,89
of the other 20-plus men
involved in this double


436
0:17:9,89 --> 0:17:10,904
homicide have ever
been convicted.


437
0:17:10,904 --> 0:17:16,21



438
0:17:16,21 --> 0:17:18,26
But the LeBarons
wouldn't quit.


439
0:17:18,26 --> 0:17:22,4
In fact, Julian LeBaron,
Benjamin's brother, has since


440
0:17:22,4 --> 0:17:24,69
taken up his dead sibling's
mantle of activism.


441
0:17:24,69 --> 0:17:24,9
SHANE SMITH: Shane.


442
0:17:24,9 --> 0:17:25,78
JULIAN LEBARON: Julian.


443
0:17:25,78 --> 0:17:27,569
SHANE SMITH: Good to meet you.


444
0:17:27,569 --> 0:17:28,75
JULIAN LEBARON: Well,
the main thing is,


445
0:17:28,75 --> 0:17:30,104
we want to be respected.


446
0:17:30,104 --> 0:17:32,692
And in Mexico, nobody's
respected.


447
0:17:32,692 --> 0:17:35,57
We're not respected by the
criminals, and we're not


448
0:17:35,57 --> 0:17:36,307
respected by the government.


449
0:17:36,307 --> 0:17:41,54



450
0:17:41,54 --> 0:17:44,85
"This is for messing with
[INAUDIBLE]'s people" or some


451
0:17:44,85 --> 0:17:45,69
stupid shit.


452
0:17:45,69 --> 0:17:46,7
I don't remember what it was.


453
0:17:46,7 --> 0:17:48,33
And that's where they
found them.


454
0:17:48,33 --> 0:17:50,586
They shot them four times
in the head each.


455
0:17:50,586 --> 0:17:51,5
SHANE SMITH: Shit.


456
0:17:51,5 --> 0:17:53,4
JULIAN LEBARON: I think that
most of us felt really


457
0:17:53,4 --> 0:17:57,1
thankful that we found them,
because sometimes they'll take


458
0:17:57,1 --> 0:17:59,46
them and torture
them to death.


459
0:17:59,46 --> 0:18:2,7
People from our neighboring
communities participated in


460
0:18:2,7 --> 0:18:3,32
this murder.


461
0:18:3,32 --> 0:18:9,494



462
0:18:9,494 --> 0:18:12,9
Those are some of the
people that are


463
0:18:12,9 --> 0:18:13,0
involved with this shit.


464
0:18:13,0 --> 0:18:13,75
SHANE SMITH: Really?


465
0:18:13,75 --> 0:18:15,45
Those guys are bad boys?


466
0:18:15,45 --> 0:18:22,786



467
0:18:22,786 --> 0:18:24,36
SHANE SMITH: Jesus Christ.


468
0:18:24,36 --> 0:18:27,87



469
0:18:27,87 --> 0:18:30,47
JULIAN LEBARON: 10 children
under the age of seven were


470
0:18:30,47 --> 0:18:34,74
left orphans when that
happened that night.


471
0:18:34,74 --> 0:18:37,775
My brother and his
brother-in-law, they were some


472
0:18:37,775 --> 0:18:39,85
of the most valuable people
in our community.


473
0:18:39,85 --> 0:18:41,94
This can never be acceptable.


474
0:18:41,94 --> 0:18:42,5
Never.


475
0:18:42,5 --> 0:18:46,75
Because if this is acceptable,
there's no future left.


476
0:18:46,75 --> 0:18:49,23
The community-- initially, what
we said is, for every


477
0:18:49,23 --> 0:18:50,673
person they kill from
our community,


478
0:18:50,673 --> 0:18:51,77
we'll kill 10 of them.


479
0:18:51,77 --> 0:18:53,561
Because we know who they are.


480
0:18:53,561 --> 0:18:56,9
And then we said, well, that's
not a solution, because then


481
0:18:56,9 --> 0:18:57,42
you become just like them.


482
0:18:57,42 --> 0:19:2,17



483
0:19:2,17 --> 0:19:3,51
SHANE SMITH: So the sun
was going down.


484
0:19:3,51 --> 0:19:4,69
It was getting a little
bit late.


485
0:19:4,69 --> 0:19:6,6
And the LeBarons told us that
we should get back to our


486
0:19:6,6 --> 0:19:8,88
hotel before it got dark.


487
0:19:8,88 --> 0:19:11,84
We are going to a hotel that's
actually in the LeBaron


488
0:19:11,84 --> 0:19:13,97
colony, which hopefully will
be a little bit safer.


489
0:19:13,97 --> 0:19:16,27
But after you hear stories
like that, you just can't


490
0:19:16,27 --> 0:19:19,93
believe the fear of violence
that these people


491
0:19:19,93 --> 0:19:21,68
live under every day.


492
0:19:21,68 --> 0:19:23,8
It makes you paranoid to
hear stories like that.


493
0:19:23,8 --> 0:19:27,714
So we're going to go to our
hotel and lock ourselves in.


494
0:19:27,714 --> 0:19:34,7



495
0:19:34,7 --> 0:19:37,93
This is a shrine to Jesus
Malverde, who's the patron


496
0:19:37,93 --> 0:19:41,9
saint of drug smugglers,
narcos.


497
0:19:41,9 --> 0:19:43,54
So we're going to
light a candle.


498
0:19:43,54 --> 0:19:46,19
This is freaking me out
because I'm very


499
0:19:46,19 --> 0:19:48,8
superstitious.


500
0:19:48,8 --> 0:19:49,16
That's him there.


501
0:19:49,16 --> 0:19:51,3
Patron saint of the
drug dealers.


502
0:19:51,3 --> 0:19:54,49
They all come in here, they
say a prayer, they write a


503
0:19:54,49 --> 0:19:57,91
prayer on here, and they say,
please let me get across the


504
0:19:57,91 --> 0:20:0,33
border with my drugs.


505
0:20:0,33 --> 0:20:3,4
Literally, religion about
drug dealers.


506
0:20:3,4 --> 0:20:8,56



507
0:20:8,56 --> 0:20:10,65
Now, the whole time I was
hanging out with the LeBarons,


508
0:20:10,65 --> 0:20:13,2
I found myself wondering, how
do you actually protect


509
0:20:13,2 --> 0:20:16,59
yourself against narco lords
who employ whole armies of


510
0:20:16,59 --> 0:20:21,9
assassins whose sole job is
to kill their rivals?


511
0:20:21,9 --> 0:20:24,1
Well, the LeBarons started by
adopting military style


512
0:20:24,1 --> 0:20:26,94
tactics and setting up
checkpoints, roadblocks, and


513
0:20:26,94 --> 0:20:27,88
watchtowers.


514
0:20:27,88 --> 0:20:29,57
BRENT LABARON: We hit
a real big low


515
0:20:29,57 --> 0:20:30,74
when they killed Benjamin.


516
0:20:30,74 --> 0:20:34,255
It was a real big blow to
our entire community.


517
0:20:34,255 --> 0:20:38,17
I was really close
to Benjamin.


518
0:20:38,17 --> 0:20:39,98
Knew him really well.


519
0:20:39,98 --> 0:20:42,96
SHANE SMITH: After Benjamin was
killed, you've set up your


520
0:20:42,96 --> 0:20:45,1
own community watch, your
own night watch.


521
0:20:45,1 --> 0:20:47,68
And then you built this up, and
you have people watching


522
0:20:47,68 --> 0:20:48,46
every night.


523
0:20:48,46 --> 0:20:49,17
BRENT LABARON: Every night.


524
0:20:49,17 --> 0:20:50,7
So we have--


525
0:20:50,7 --> 0:20:51,12
SHANE SMITH: What are
you watching for?


526
0:20:51,12 --> 0:20:54,47
BRENT LABARON: Pretty much
suspicious vehicles.


527
0:20:54,47 --> 0:20:55,94
We pretty much know everybody.


528
0:20:55,94 --> 0:20:58,69
And so if it looks like a
vehicle I've never seen


529
0:20:58,69 --> 0:21:0,79
before, then it was
getting checked.


530
0:21:0,79 --> 0:21:3,37
SHANE SMITH: This watch hut
looks down on one of the main


531
0:21:3,37 --> 0:21:4,57
drug trafficking roads.


532
0:21:4,57 --> 0:21:5,73
BRENT LABARON: One
of them, yeah.


533
0:21:5,73 --> 0:21:7,4
SHANE SMITH: The only
people here with


534
0:21:7,4 --> 0:21:9,95
weapons are the criminals.


535
0:21:9,95 --> 0:21:10,57
BRENT LABARON: Pretty much.


536
0:21:10,57 --> 0:21:11,65
SHANE SMITH: The drug cartels.


537
0:21:11,65 --> 0:21:13,42
BRENT LABARON: Rumor got out
that we had high-powered


538
0:21:13,42 --> 0:21:15,84
rifles and snipers
and whatnot.


539
0:21:15,84 --> 0:21:18,17
SHANE SMITH: And .50 cals
up here and stuff.


540
0:21:18,17 --> 0:21:20,99
BRENT LABARON: Well, you know
how rumors can spread.


541
0:21:20,99 --> 0:21:22,64
Which was a benefit for us.


542
0:21:22,64 --> 0:21:22,955
SHANE SMITH: Yeah, it's good.


543
0:21:22,955 --> 0:21:23,27
It's a good rumor.


544
0:21:23,27 --> 0:21:25,57
BRENT LABARON: It was a really
good rumor for us, you know.


545
0:21:25,57 --> 0:21:29,77
I believe that the watchtower
is one of the key points to


546
0:21:29,77 --> 0:21:32,27
keeping the bad guys
away from our town.


547
0:21:32,27 --> 0:21:36,1
Also, the feds and the military
are in our town.


548
0:21:36,1 --> 0:21:36,93
This is their base.


549
0:21:36,93 --> 0:21:40,27
We actually had a roadblock, to
where there was one way in


550
0:21:40,27 --> 0:21:41,64
and one way out.


551
0:21:41,64 --> 0:21:44,26
SHANE SMITH: So you have
barricades, checkpoints, and


552
0:21:44,26 --> 0:21:44,93
watchtowers?


553
0:21:44,93 --> 0:21:46,4
BRENT LABARON: Yeah.


554
0:21:46,4 --> 0:21:49,22
I would say our valley right
here is quite a bit safer than


555
0:21:49,22 --> 0:21:50,33
a lot of areas--


556
0:21:50,33 --> 0:21:52,5
SHANE SMITH: Casas Grandes,
which is about 30 minutes


557
0:21:52,5 --> 0:21:55,51
away, they're still having
kidnappings and stuff there.


558
0:21:55,51 --> 0:21:56,52
BRENT LABARON: Here and there.


559
0:21:56,52 --> 0:21:59,89
Before, it was literally
two, three a week.


560
0:21:59,89 --> 0:22:0,75
SHANE SMITH: Wow.


561
0:22:0,75 --> 0:22:1,97
That's a lot.


562
0:22:1,97 --> 0:22:3,11
BRENT LABARON: That's
a lot, yeah.


563
0:22:3,11 --> 0:22:6,81
So We were never pinpointing
drug cartels or anything else,


564
0:22:6,81 --> 0:22:10,71
but when it came to them now
kidnapping our family members,


565
0:22:10,71 --> 0:22:12,86
that's what we took
a stand against.


566
0:22:12,86 --> 0:22:15,51
When it comes to protecting our
family, if we have to die


567
0:22:15,51 --> 0:22:18,97
doing it, we're going to.


568
0:22:18,97 --> 0:22:20,76
SHANE SMITH: So the LeBarons
made their colony into a


569
0:22:20,76 --> 0:22:23,94
little fortress using the same
counter-terrorist techniques


570
0:22:23,94 --> 0:22:26,92
that the US Army uses in
Iraq and Afghanistan.


571
0:22:26,92 --> 0:22:29,26
And because of it, the killings
and the kidnappings


572
0:22:29,26 --> 0:22:31,98
in the Mormon areas actually
died down.


573
0:22:31,98 --> 0:22:34,34
But roadblocks and security
checkpoints are only going to


574
0:22:34,34 --> 0:22:35,47
get you so far.


575
0:22:35,47 --> 0:22:37,96
At some point, if you're
fighting the narcos, you're


576
0:22:37,96 --> 0:22:39,7
going to need guns.


577
0:22:39,7 --> 0:22:43,18
If Benjamin was taken by a bunch
of guys with weapons,


578
0:22:43,18 --> 0:22:46,88
they were unarmed, how are you
supposed to defend yourself?


579
0:22:46,88 --> 0:22:49,1
BRENT LABARON: Well, there's
really no law in Mexico that


580
0:22:49,1 --> 0:22:51,92
gives you the right
to bear arms.


581
0:22:51,92 --> 0:22:56,68
Legally, the quickest and best
way is through a gun club.


582
0:22:56,68 --> 0:22:57,98
SHANE SMITH: Now, in
Mexico, it's nearly


583
0:22:57,98 --> 0:22:59,62
impossible to own a gun.


584
0:22:59,62 --> 0:23:2,82
In fact, one of the only legal
ways to do so is to go through


585
0:23:2,82 --> 0:23:6,2
the extremely difficult process
of starting a gun club


586
0:23:6,2 --> 0:23:7,45
or a shooting range.


587
0:23:7,45 --> 0:23:13,81



588
0:23:13,81 --> 0:23:15,48
Why don't you have
your own shooting


589
0:23:15,48 --> 0:23:16,45
club in Colonia LeBaron?


590
0:23:16,45 --> 0:23:18,34
BRENT LABARON: Our ex-mayor
wouldn't sign


591
0:23:18,34 --> 0:23:19,792
the papers we needed.


592
0:23:19,792 --> 0:23:23,67
We had all the first
members on a list.


593
0:23:23,67 --> 0:23:25,58
Well, he turns around
and shows it


594
0:23:25,58 --> 0:23:27,4
to our bad boy buddies.


595
0:23:27,4 --> 0:23:29,34
SHANE SMITH: You're trying to
arm yourselves, and he's


596
0:23:29,34 --> 0:23:32,35
working for the cartels so
you can't arm yourselves.


597
0:23:32,35 --> 0:23:32,68
BRENT LABARON: Exactly.


598
0:23:32,68 --> 0:23:33,1
Pretty.


599
0:23:33,1 --> 0:23:33,28
Much.


600
0:23:33,28 --> 0:23:34,8
SHANE SMITH: Where is he now?


601
0:23:34,8 --> 0:23:35,33
BRENT LABARON: He's in prison.


602
0:23:35,33 --> 0:23:39,46



603
0:23:39,46 --> 0:23:42,41
SHANE SMITH: There's 15 million
illegal assault rifles


604
0:23:42,41 --> 0:23:44,7
estimated in Mexico.


605
0:23:44,7 --> 0:23:45,66
I mean, the thing is,
if you have 20 guys


606
0:23:45,66 --> 0:23:46,91
with assault rifles--


607
0:23:46,91 --> 0:23:49,598



608
0:23:49,598 --> 0:23:52,996
Maybe I'm going to go for
one of those turkeys.


609
0:23:52,996 --> 0:23:53,516
Oh yeah.


610
0:23:53,516 --> 0:23:56,292
I'm going to get one of them.


611
0:23:56,292 --> 0:23:57,13
No.


612
0:23:57,13 --> 0:23:59,64
So the LeBarons finally decided
that if it continued


613
0:23:59,64 --> 0:24:2,57
to be illegal to own weapons,
which meant criminals were the


614
0:24:2,57 --> 0:24:5,34
only ones that had guns, that it
was time to change the law.


615
0:24:5,34 --> 0:24:12,71



616
0:24:12,71 --> 0:24:15,93
Alex LeBaron, who's now a
congressman, is determined to


617
0:24:15,93 --> 0:24:18,0
protect his colony from
the cartels, no


618
0:24:18,0 --> 0:24:19,3
matter what it takes.


619
0:24:19,3 --> 0:24:22,7
Even if it means a shootout
with the Mexican military.


620
0:24:22,7 --> 0:24:24,7
ALEX LEBARON: They went
into our farm.


621
0:24:24,7 --> 0:24:25,49
We thought they were
criminals.


622
0:24:25,49 --> 0:24:26,63
We shot one of them.


623
0:24:26,63 --> 0:24:28,93
It was a very sad incident,
but it gained a lot


624
0:24:28,93 --> 0:24:29,91
of respect for us.


625
0:24:29,91 --> 0:24:31,3
SHANE SMITH: You outshot
the military.


626
0:24:31,3 --> 0:24:32,15
ALEX LEBARON: We outshot
the military.


627
0:24:32,15 --> 0:24:35,44
We got phone calls from heads of
the criminal organizations


628
0:24:35,44 --> 0:24:36,76
after that incident.


629
0:24:36,76 --> 0:24:39,75
And they told us they were proud
of us to some degree.


630
0:24:39,75 --> 0:24:42,69
People in drug organizations,
and including the same


631
0:24:42,69 --> 0:24:44,63
military, know that we
have weapons because


632
0:24:44,63 --> 0:24:45,72
we've been saying it.


633
0:24:45,72 --> 0:24:48,12
We have illegal weapons
in our community.


634
0:24:48,12 --> 0:24:49,15
Come in and find them
if you want.


635
0:24:49,15 --> 0:24:50,11
We buy them in the states.


636
0:24:50,11 --> 0:24:51,65
We know we traffic
them illegally.


637
0:24:51,65 --> 0:24:53,9
But that's the only
way to defend


638
0:24:53,9 --> 0:24:55,6
yourself in this country.


639
0:24:55,6 --> 0:24:57,4
In order to get access to a
weapon here in our country, it


640
0:24:57,4 --> 0:24:58,93
would cost you up to $10,000.


641
0:24:58,93 --> 0:25:0,79
And that wouldn't even be
through a legal way.


642
0:25:0,79 --> 0:25:2,9
SHANE SMITH: So the majority of
the weapons being used by


643
0:25:2,9 --> 0:25:5,21
the narcos are coming
from America.


644
0:25:5,21 --> 0:25:5,94
ALEX LEBARON: Absolutely.


645
0:25:5,94 --> 0:25:7,39
SHANE SMITH: And the money
is coming from America.


646
0:25:7,39 --> 0:25:8,2
ALEX LEBARON: Absolutely.


647
0:25:8,2 --> 0:25:11,28
I think the Americans need to
really understand that any


648
0:25:11,28 --> 0:25:13,98
policies that are implemented
in the United States impact


649
0:25:13,98 --> 0:25:15,23
our country.


650
0:25:15,23 --> 0:25:17,59



651
0:25:17,59 --> 0:25:18,95
SHANE SMITH: So the money
for all these guns


652
0:25:18,95 --> 0:25:20,22
is coming from America.


653
0:25:20,22 --> 0:25:22,83
The guns themselves
come from America.


654
0:25:22,83 --> 0:25:25,14
The coke is being
sold in America.


655
0:25:25,14 --> 0:25:27,84
But the war is being
fought in Mexico.


656
0:25:27,84 --> 0:25:31,29
And considering 1,300 people
were killed in the region just


657
0:25:31,29 --> 0:25:34,95
this past August alone, in
northern Mexico, self-defense


658
0:25:34,95 --> 0:25:37,71
has truly become a matter
of life and death.


659
0:25:37,71 --> 0:25:44,84



660
0:25:44,84 --> 0:25:46,11
BRENT LABARON: In the last
while, it's actually calmed


661
0:25:46,11 --> 0:25:47,1
down quite a bit.


662
0:25:47,1 --> 0:25:50,37
I haven't heard of that many
kidnappings lately.


663
0:25:50,37 --> 0:25:51,99
Usually, it was like, boom.


664
0:25:51,99 --> 0:25:54,3
Every other day, oh my goodness,
there was another


665
0:25:54,3 --> 0:25:55,5
kidnapping, you know?


666
0:25:55,5 --> 0:25:56,61
The Joneses got kidnapped.


667
0:25:56,61 --> 0:25:58,72
Like, Romney got
kidnapped, or--


668
0:25:58,72 --> 0:26:1,22
just someone you affiliated
with.


669
0:26:1,22 --> 0:26:2,86
SHANE SMITH: Now, it's hard to
picture a place that's so


670
0:26:2,86 --> 0:26:6,3
fucked up that not that many
kidnappings is a sign that


671
0:26:6,3 --> 0:26:7,3
things are going well.


672
0:26:7,3 --> 0:26:10,3
But in northern Mexico,
everything is relative.


673
0:26:10,3 --> 0:26:13,82
The sobering reality of it is,
in Mexico, in 2011 there were


674
0:26:13,82 --> 0:26:16,67
49 kidnappings a day.


675
0:26:16,67 --> 0:26:18,61
BRENT LABARON: Things have
actually kind of calmed down


676
0:26:18,61 --> 0:26:20,86
enough to where they actually
have parties


677
0:26:20,86 --> 0:26:22,19
and rodeos and whatnot.


678
0:26:22,19 --> 0:26:29,17



679
0:26:29,17 --> 0:26:31,6
SHANE SMITH: So they're having
this rodeo because a


680
0:26:31,6 --> 0:26:32,49
dude lost his leg?


681
0:26:32,49 --> 0:26:35,6
BRENT LABARON: Yeah, one of the
cowboys lost his leg, and


682
0:26:35,6 --> 0:26:37,292
they're doing a benefit
for him.

0:26:38,542 --> 0:26:43,37



685
0:26:43,37 --> 0:26:45,2
SHANE SMITH: One of the things
that we were worried about


686
0:26:45,2 --> 0:26:47,935
before we came here was people
knowing that we were here,


687
0:26:47,935 --> 0:26:49,3
people knowing that
we were shooting.


688
0:26:49,3 --> 0:26:51,366
And now we're in front of the
whole town in a town where


689
0:26:51,366 --> 0:26:53,74
they used to have three or
four kidnappings a week.


690
0:26:53,74 --> 0:26:56,275
And we're just parading in
front of everyone with a

SHANE SMITH: They've just
announced to the whole town


695
0:27:4,796 --> 0:27:6,47
that we're here shooting.


696
0:27:6,47 --> 0:27:7,86

0:27:26,36 --> 0:27:26,675

Let's put that on.

SHANE SMITH: Now, hanging out
with the LeBarons and play


704
0:27:30,4 --> 0:27:32,83
acting as a cowpoke relaxed
us a little bit.


705
0:27:32,83 --> 0:27:34,13
As did the booze.


706
0:27:34,13 --> 0:27:36,33
I'd like to say "cheers" to the
LeBaron family because you


707
0:27:36,33 --> 0:27:37,235
guys fucking rock.

Good times, good friends.

717
0:28:1,23 --> 0:28:3,556
sang some songs together.


718
0:28:3,556 --> 0:28:4,913

720
0:28:20,5 --> 0:28:21,76
SHANE SMITH: After drinking
for a bit with Brent, he


721
0:28:21,76 --> 0:28:23,93
suggested we go on a ride-along
on the nightly


722
0:28:23,93 --> 0:28:27,71
patrol of the LeBaron colony.


723
0:28:27,71 --> 0:28:30,92
Now, I was picturing a pickup
truck with a CB and a couple


724
0:28:30,92 --> 0:28:32,38
of good ol' boys in the back.


725
0:28:32,38 --> 0:28:35,31
But what we got instead was some
heavy, heavy business.


726
0:28:35,31 --> 0:28:42,135



727
0:28:42,135 --> 0:28:43,8
What are we doing right now?


728
0:28:43,8 --> 0:28:47,13
BRENT LABARON: So we're just
going to take on a routine


729
0:28:47,13 --> 0:28:48,95
route that they normally take.


730
0:28:48,95 --> 0:28:52,285
And then they'll probably do
a security checkpoint for a


731
0:28:52,285 --> 0:28:52,72
little while.


732
0:28:52,72 --> 0:28:54,49
And maybe check some


733
0:28:54,49 --> 0:28:56,6
suspicious vehicles or something.


734
0:28:56,6 --> 0:29:13,23



735
0:29:13,23 --> 0:29:16,33
These guys use our town as
a base because they trust


736
0:29:16,33 --> 0:29:17,32
everyone here.


737
0:29:17,32 --> 0:29:19,45
SHANE SMITH: One of the things
that's pretty crazy is you're


738
0:29:19,45 --> 0:29:22,71
driving through with pickup
trucks with four armed guards


739
0:29:22,71 --> 0:29:24,83
in the back and two guys in the
front, all with machine


740
0:29:24,83 --> 0:29:27,3
guns, for a town of
1,200 people.


741
0:29:27,3 --> 0:29:28,28
So shit is serious.


742
0:29:28,28 --> 0:29:34,53



743
0:29:34,53 --> 0:29:36,66
So the federales kept
stopping people.


744
0:29:36,66 --> 0:29:38,89
And they didn't seem to mind
us riding along with them.


745
0:29:38,89 --> 0:29:40,82
Until they roadblocked
the actual highway.


746
0:29:40,82 --> 0:29:44,232
Which, remember, is one of the
main drug routes into America.


747
0:29:44,232 --> 0:29:45,887
The cops are going to
stop some cars and


748
0:29:45,887 --> 0:29:48,5
look for some drugs.


749
0:29:48,5 --> 0:29:50,61
Then as the sun was going down,
they warned us that we


750
0:29:50,61 --> 0:29:53,4
should leave because it was
very dangerous to even


751
0:29:53,4 --> 0:29:54,32
be seen with them.


752
0:29:54,32 --> 0:29:56,36
Because as it turned out, riding
around with them on the


753
0:29:56,36 --> 0:29:57,62
back roads is one thing.


754
0:29:57,62 --> 0:29:59,35
But stopping actual
drug runners on


755
0:29:59,35 --> 0:30:0,835
the highway was another.


756
0:30:0,835 --> 0:30:7,4



757
0:30:7,4 --> 0:30:9,59
You want a beer?


758
0:30:9,59 --> 0:30:13,31
Back at the hotel, we realized
that our fun, boozy afternoon


759
0:30:13,31 --> 0:30:15,86
had some unforeseen
consequences.


760
0:30:15,86 --> 0:30:18,15
About an hour ago, a black
pickup sort of


761
0:30:18,15 --> 0:30:19,77
drove by really slowly.


762
0:30:19,77 --> 0:30:21,78
And then kind of sped off.


763
0:30:21,78 --> 0:30:24,77
Black trucks like the ones
Julian had pointed out earlier


764
0:30:24,77 --> 0:30:28,94
had actually stopped, taken
pictures, and checked us out.


765
0:30:28,94 --> 0:30:32,5
And all a sudden, our LeBaron
run around town drunk time


766
0:30:32,5 --> 0:30:33,99
didn't seem so smart anymore.


767
0:30:33,99 --> 0:30:34,76
All right.


768
0:30:34,76 --> 0:30:37,393
So we have to leave now
because we shot


769
0:30:37,393 --> 0:30:38,68
today at the rodeo.


770
0:30:38,68 --> 0:30:40,36
And then we did a drive-by
with the cops.


771
0:30:40,36 --> 0:30:42,75
So everybody in town knows
that we're here.


772
0:30:42,75 --> 0:30:45,975
And then we've just had a black
truck with black windows


773
0:30:45,975 --> 0:30:48,94
stop, pull up, check us
out, then drive off.


774
0:30:48,94 --> 0:30:51,44
And a black truck, I just found
out, came by and took


775
0:30:51,44 --> 0:30:53,8
pictures of us before
I got here.


776
0:30:53,8 --> 0:30:56,34
So we have to go to another
hotel that we've arranged,


777
0:30:56,34 --> 0:30:58,33
which is crazy.


778
0:30:58,33 --> 0:30:59,56
So we took off.


779
0:30:59,56 --> 0:31:1,92
And when we called Brent to tell
him we had left, I half


780
0:31:1,92 --> 0:31:3,95
expected him to say, hey,
you're overreacting.


781
0:31:3,95 --> 0:31:4,64
It's nothing.


782
0:31:4,64 --> 0:31:5,98
But in actual fact,
when he heard the


783
0:31:5,98 --> 0:31:7,51
story, he said, oh yeah.


784
0:31:7,51 --> 0:31:9,11
You should get the fuck
out of Dodge.


785
0:31:9,11 --> 0:31:12,81



786
0:31:12,81 --> 0:31:16,71
[ROOSTER CROWS]


787
0:31:16,71 --> 0:31:18,89
SHANE SMITH: Now, because
Colonia LeBaron is so close to


788
0:31:18,89 --> 0:31:21,72
the American border, they're
totally affected by our


789
0:31:21,72 --> 0:31:22,92
immigration policy.


790
0:31:22,92 --> 0:31:24,75
And of course, our
war on drugs.


791
0:31:24,75 --> 0:31:27,6
If America sneezes, Mexico
catches cold.


792
0:31:27,6 --> 0:31:30,8
And because of this, they're
extremely interested in


793
0:31:30,8 --> 0:31:31,33
American political policy.


794
0:31:31,33 --> 0:31:36,62



795
0:31:36,62 --> 0:31:38,18
You have narco cartels.


796
0:31:38,18 --> 0:31:39,13
You have a drug route.


797
0:31:39,13 --> 0:31:40,96
You have illegal immigration.


798
0:31:40,96 --> 0:31:42,62
So all of these problems.


799
0:31:42,62 --> 0:31:44,5
Who do you think should
be the next President


800
0:31:44,5 --> 0:31:46,32
of the United States?


801
0:31:46,32 --> 0:31:49,72
BRENT LABARON: Mitt Romney has
a great, great policy.


802
0:31:49,72 --> 0:31:51,6
SHANE SMITH: Now, are
you just saying that


803
0:31:51,6 --> 0:31:53,18
because you're Mormonish?


804
0:31:53,18 --> 0:31:55,82
BRENT LABARON: His ties, his
people, his family lives right


805
0:31:55,82 --> 0:31:57,316
across the mountain here.


806
0:31:57,316 --> 0:31:59,85
You should probably meet them.


807
0:31:59,85 --> 0:32:1,86
SHANE SMITH: Now, when Brent
says "his family," he means


808
0:32:1,86 --> 0:32:5,54
presidential candidate
Mitt Romney's family.


809
0:32:5,54 --> 0:32:8,21
Now, we knew that his father,
George Romney, had been born


810
0:32:8,21 --> 0:32:10,2
into a Mormon colony
in Mexico.


811
0:32:10,2 --> 0:32:12,39
But not that they still
had an active Romney


812
0:32:12,39 --> 0:32:14,165
colony here in Chihuahua.


813
0:32:14,165 --> 0:32:17,27
So the Romneys still live
here across the valley?


814
0:32:17,27 --> 0:32:17,62
BRENT LABARON: Yep.


815
0:32:17,62 --> 0:32:19,7
They're some great guys.


816
0:32:19,7 --> 0:32:21,18
Just really like them.


817
0:32:21,18 --> 0:32:22,785
Golf with them quite
often, and just


818
0:32:22,785 --> 0:32:24,67
some really cool guys.


819
0:32:24,67 --> 0:32:26,93
SHANE SMITH: So we went across
the valley to check them out.


820
0:32:26,93 --> 0:32:33,67



821
0:32:33,67 --> 0:32:34,8
KELLY ROMNEY: Nine holes
with two par


822
0:32:34,8 --> 0:32:36,91
fives and two par threes.


823
0:32:36,91 --> 0:32:38,61
And the rest are fours.


824
0:32:38,61 --> 0:32:39,75
Pretty nice greens, huh?


825
0:32:39,75 --> 0:32:40,61
SHANE SMITH: Beautiful.


826
0:32:40,61 --> 0:32:42,9
How did this golf
course start?


827
0:32:42,9 --> 0:32:44,52
KELLY ROMNEY: We just got a
group together that liked to


828
0:32:44,52 --> 0:32:47,54
play golf and copied other
golf courses, put in a


829
0:32:47,54 --> 0:32:49,97
sprinkling system.


830
0:32:49,97 --> 0:32:53,54
When the violence started, we
lost quite a few members.


831
0:32:53,54 --> 0:32:59,1
Just like in Casas Grandes,
a lot of people moved out.


832
0:32:59,1 --> 0:33:1,5
SHANE SMITH: You play here with
some of the LeBarons from


833
0:33:1,5 --> 0:33:1,82
Colonia LeBaron?


834
0:33:1,82 --> 0:33:2,1
KELLY ROMNEY: Yeah.


835
0:33:2,1 --> 0:33:3,88
Some of the guys come
over here and play.


836
0:33:3,88 --> 0:33:4,33
SHANE SMITH: And who's better?


837
0:33:4,33 --> 0:33:5,48
The LeBarons or the Romneys?


838
0:33:5,48 --> 0:33:8,5
KELLY ROMNEY: The LeBarons.


839
0:33:8,5 --> 0:33:10,55
I don't know what they're
eating over there, but--


840
0:33:10,55 --> 0:33:11,8
[LAUGHS].


841
0:33:11,8 --> 0:33:15,83



842
0:33:15,83 --> 0:33:18,32
SHANE SMITH: So how long have
the Romneys been here?


843
0:33:18,32 --> 0:33:19,34
KELLY ROMNEY: 1885.


844
0:33:19,34 --> 0:33:22,62
My great grandfather, Miles Park
Romney, was one of the


845
0:33:22,62 --> 0:33:25,5
original people that
came here.


846
0:33:25,5 --> 0:33:26,86
Mitt is a relative.


847
0:33:26,86 --> 0:33:28,4
He's a second cousin.


848
0:33:28,4 --> 0:33:30,56
SHANE SMITH: So his dad
was born in Chihuahua?


849
0:33:30,56 --> 0:33:32,65
BRENT LABARON: He was born
in Colonia Dublan, about


850
0:33:32,65 --> 0:33:34,43
15 miles from here.


851
0:33:34,43 --> 0:33:36,87
Their family left, and they
stayed in the United States.


852
0:33:36,87 --> 0:33:38,13
They didn't come back.


853
0:33:38,13 --> 0:33:41,46
You know, I remember his father
ran for President of


854
0:33:41,46 --> 0:33:42,4
the United States in '68.


855
0:33:42,4 --> 0:33:44,45
Or at least he was
a candidate.


856
0:33:44,45 --> 0:33:46,44
His citizenship was
questioned.


857
0:33:46,44 --> 0:33:49,19
Because he was born here in
Mexico, but he was born of


858
0:33:49,19 --> 0:33:50,51
American parents.


859
0:33:50,51 --> 0:33:53,77
SHANE SMITH: And do you think
that this craziness around the


860
0:33:53,77 --> 0:33:56,72
run-up to the election, is
that bringing too much


861
0:33:56,72 --> 0:33:57,63
attention, or?


862
0:33:57,63 --> 0:34:0,51
KELLY ROMNEY: I think one of the
reasons it's brought a lot


863
0:34:0,51 --> 0:34:3,49
of attention to here is because
of Mitt's position on


864
0:34:3,49 --> 0:34:4,25
illegal immigration.


865
0:34:4,25 --> 0:34:4,66
SHANE SMITH: Right.


866
0:34:4,66 --> 0:34:7,58
Now what's ironic about this
is that Mitt Romney, whose


867
0:34:7,58 --> 0:34:10,33
father was born in Mexico and
would be considered the poster


868
0:34:10,33 --> 0:34:12,71
child of the Dream Act, actually
has one of the


869
0:34:12,71 --> 0:34:15,23
staunchest views on immigration
in his already


870
0:34:15,23 --> 0:34:17,29
conservative Republican Party.


871
0:34:17,29 --> 0:34:18,73
MITT ROMNEY: And I've indicated
I would veto the


872
0:34:18,73 --> 0:34:21,6
Dream Act if provisions included
that people who are


873
0:34:21,6 --> 0:34:24,34
here illegally, if they go to
school here long enough, get a


874
0:34:24,34 --> 0:34:26,9
degree here, that they can
become permanent residents.


875
0:34:26,9 --> 0:34:29,3
I think that's a mistake.


876
0:34:29,3 --> 0:34:31,15
SHANE SMITH: Now, it seems a bit
weird for a person who's


877
0:34:31,15 --> 0:34:34,51
essentially a first generation
immigrant to have such harsh


878
0:34:34,51 --> 0:34:36,32
views on immigration.


879
0:34:36,32 --> 0:34:39,239
It's kind of like, "Methink
thy dost protest too much"


880
0:34:39,239 --> 0:34:41,42
kind of deal.


881
0:34:41,42 --> 0:34:44,699
And his own cousin Kelly, who
although he supports Mitt for


882
0:34:44,699 --> 0:34:46,489
president, thinks that
his position on


883
0:34:46,489 --> 0:34:48,28
immigration is wrong.


884
0:34:48,28 --> 0:34:50,61
KELLY ROMNEY: I think
he needs to change.


885
0:34:50,61 --> 0:34:54,15
Being born and raised in Mexico,
and especially since


886
0:34:54,15 --> 0:34:57,99
NAFTA, I think the United States
is partly responsible


887
0:34:57,99 --> 0:35:0,47
for the increase in illegal
immigration we have.


888
0:35:0,47 --> 0:35:0,84
SHANE SMITH: Right.


889
0:35:0,84 --> 0:35:2,71
So America makes policy.


890
0:35:2,71 --> 0:35:5,36
Then all of a sudden, northern
Mexico gets screwed up.


891
0:35:5,36 --> 0:35:6,26
KELLY ROMNEY: That's right.


892
0:35:6,26 --> 0:35:8,7
Give amnesty to those that are
out there that are working


893
0:35:8,7 --> 0:35:11,54
legitimately and have a job,
come up with a guest worker


894
0:35:11,54 --> 0:35:14,5
program, and let these people
go out there and work, and


895
0:35:14,5 --> 0:35:16,35
then come home and take
care of their family.


896
0:35:16,35 --> 0:35:17,53
Because basically, they're
starving to


897
0:35:17,53 --> 0:35:18,81
death here in Mexico.


898
0:35:18,81 --> 0:35:21,13
SHANE SMITH: In fact, it's so
bad that for many people,


899
0:35:21,13 --> 0:35:22,66
there's only really
two options.


900
0:35:22,66 --> 0:35:24,5
One, sneak into America.


901
0:35:24,5 --> 0:35:26,48
Or two, work for the cartels.


902
0:35:26,48 --> 0:35:28,79
You know, didn't some farmers
go up from the farms and go


903
0:35:28,79 --> 0:35:30,39
into the mountains and
start growing drugs?


904
0:35:30,39 --> 0:35:30,78
KELLY ROMNEY: Yeah.


905
0:35:30,78 --> 0:35:32,87
A lot of them have gone into the
mountain areas, and they


906
0:35:32,87 --> 0:35:33,56
grow drugs there.


907
0:35:33,56 --> 0:35:35,37
SHANE SMITH: And now we're
sitting here going, OK, well,


908
0:35:35,37 --> 0:35:35,92
what are we going to do?


909
0:35:35,92 --> 0:35:36,63
KELLY ROMNEY: What are
we going to do?


910
0:35:36,63 --> 0:35:37,16
Exactly.


911
0:35:37,16 --> 0:35:38,54
You know?


912
0:35:38,54 --> 0:35:40,28
I wish Mitt would make
contact with us.


913
0:35:40,28 --> 0:35:43,28
And I really think that
we could help him.


914
0:35:43,28 --> 0:35:45,52
SHANE SMITH: And as I would
later realize, contacting the


915
0:35:45,52 --> 0:35:48,14
Mexican side of his family would
probably be the last


916
0:35:48,14 --> 0:35:49,73
thing that Mitt Romney
would do.


917
0:35:49,73 --> 0:35:51,53
MITT ROMNEY: I think marijuana
should not be


918
0:35:51,53 --> 0:35:52,38
legal in this country.


919
0:35:52,38 --> 0:35:57,7
I believe it's a gateway drug
to other drug violations.


920
0:35:57,7 --> 0:36:0,44
The use of illegal drugs in
this country is leading to


921
0:36:0,44 --> 0:36:1,69
terrible consequences.


922
0:36:1,69 --> 0:36:5,96



923
0:36:5,96 --> 0:36:8,25
SHANE SMITH: Now, we all know
Mitt Romney's stance on drugs.


924
0:36:8,25 --> 0:36:10,31
But it was interesting to hear
Kelly's thoughts on the drug


925
0:36:10,31 --> 0:36:13,64
war, considering it affects
him every day.


926
0:36:13,64 --> 0:36:16,5
KELLY ROMNEY: To me, this used
to be the most peaceful place


927
0:36:16,5 --> 0:36:17,1
in the world.


928
0:36:17,1 --> 0:36:17,41
Yeah, man.


929
0:36:17,41 --> 0:36:20,55
I used let my kids go to Nuevo
Casas Grandes, go to the


930
0:36:20,55 --> 0:36:22,99
shows, go to dances,
go to parties.


931
0:36:22,99 --> 0:36:25,89
But now, you keep close watch.


932
0:36:25,89 --> 0:36:29,5
And it all has to do with the
drug violence that it started.


933
0:36:29,5 --> 0:36:33,25
When they started the
war on drugs, the


934
0:36:33,25 --> 0:36:35,54
violence just escalated.


935
0:36:35,54 --> 0:36:37,47
Most of the problems
that we have around


936
0:36:37,47 --> 0:36:39,26
here are drug related.


937
0:36:39,26 --> 0:36:42,58
And there's been some
kidnappings and some killings


938
0:36:42,58 --> 0:36:45,8
from drug-related things.


939
0:36:45,8 --> 0:36:48,38
SHANE SMITH: Have there ever
been any Romneys kidnapped?


940
0:36:48,38 --> 0:36:50,51
KELLY ROMNEY: Yeah, my brother
was kidnapped three


941
0:36:50,51 --> 0:36:52,2
years ago in May.


942
0:36:52,2 --> 0:36:54,17
I think they kept him
for two days.


943
0:36:54,17 --> 0:36:56,3
Took him to a cave up
in the mountains.


944
0:36:56,3 --> 0:36:57,28
We paid a small ransom.


945
0:36:57,28 --> 0:36:58,4
It wasn't a lot.


946
0:36:58,4 --> 0:36:59,92
They were mainly punks.


947
0:36:59,92 --> 0:37:2,26
They weren't really
professionals.


948
0:37:2,26 --> 0:37:5,35
SHANE SMITH: And most of the
weapons that are here in


949
0:37:5,35 --> 0:37:7,35
Mexico are illegal weapons.


950
0:37:7,35 --> 0:37:9,37
And most of those illegal
weapons are


951
0:37:9,37 --> 0:37:10,58
coming from the States.


952
0:37:10,58 --> 0:37:11,38
KELLY ROMNEY: Yes.


953
0:37:11,38 --> 0:37:14,8
Fast and Furious, I'm sure
you heard about that.


954
0:37:14,8 --> 0:37:16,95
SHANE SMITH: Now, the Fast and
the Furious scandal he's


955
0:37:16,95 --> 0:37:20,32
talking about refers to a case
where the American government


956
0:37:20,32 --> 0:37:22,57
gave thousands of guns
to the cartels in


957
0:37:22,57 --> 0:37:23,64
order to track them.


958
0:37:23,64 --> 0:37:26,46
Then, they proceeded to lose
track of them until they


959
0:37:26,46 --> 0:37:29,93
surfaced again in the murder
cases of American agents.


960
0:37:29,93 --> 0:37:31,26
KELLY ROMNEY: What, did they
think they were going to be


961
0:37:31,26 --> 0:37:32,18
able to keep control of them?


962
0:37:32,18 --> 0:37:33,75
Or keep track of them?


963
0:37:33,75 --> 0:37:34,66
Nonsense.


964
0:37:34,66 --> 0:37:37,5
I don't know what in the world
they were thinking in sending


965
0:37:37,5 --> 0:37:40,47
all those weapons to Mexico.


966
0:37:40,47 --> 0:37:42,38
SHANE SMITH: And the Fast and
the Furious scandal is just


967
0:37:42,38 --> 0:37:44,64
one of many that have seriously
embarrassed the


968
0:37:44,64 --> 0:37:45,89
American government.


969
0:37:45,89 --> 0:37:49,48
Now, perhaps Mitt's hard-line
stance on issues like guns,


970
0:37:49,48 --> 0:37:52,43
immigration, and drugs
becomes more clear.


971
0:37:52,43 --> 0:37:55,16
Because even though his father
was born in Chihuahua, Mitt


972
0:37:55,16 --> 0:37:57,64
surely must want to distance
himself from the region.


973
0:37:57,64 --> 0:38:0,53
Because the region is
totally fucked up.


974
0:38:0,53 --> 0:38:2,95
And it's not the first time that
this has been the Romney


975
0:38:2,95 --> 0:38:4,5
strategy either.


976
0:38:4,5 --> 0:38:6,8
When his father ran for
president, both his


977
0:38:6,8 --> 0:38:9,45
citizenship and his Mormon
colony's polygamist roots were


978
0:38:9,45 --> 0:38:10,92
called into question.


979
0:38:10,92 --> 0:38:11,3
And.


980
0:38:11,3 --> 0:38:13,87
His run for the White House
didn't last too long.


981
0:38:13,87 --> 0:38:17,1
But Mitt Romney has to deal with
his family's polygamist


982
0:38:17,1 --> 0:38:21,73
past, kidnapping, drug wars,
and, in the extreme case of


983
0:38:21,73 --> 0:38:25,44
Ervil LeBaron, crazy Mormon
blood atonement.


984
0:38:25,44 --> 0:38:28,785
Now, having close familial ties
to all this shit does not


985
0:38:28,785 --> 0:38:30,45
a good presidential
candidate make.


986
0:38:30,45 --> 0:38:33,75



987
0:38:33,75 --> 0:38:36,65
Being on the front lines of
this, what do you think are


988
0:38:36,65 --> 0:38:38,34
some of the solutions
to these problems?


989
0:38:38,34 --> 0:38:40,33
KELLY ROMNEY: Looking at it from
a perspective of someone


990
0:38:40,33 --> 0:38:43,25
living here, we say, well, why
don't they legalize it in the


991
0:38:43,25 --> 0:38:47,73
United States and cut out all
the violence in Mexico?


992
0:38:47,73 --> 0:38:50,68
As long as you have the swimming
pool over there, this


993
0:38:50,68 --> 0:38:52,476
is going to be the
diving board.


994
0:38:52,476 --> 0:38:57,56



995
0:38:57,56 --> 0:38:59,26
SHANE SMITH: So as we began
our long drive back to the


996
0:38:59,26 --> 0:39:1,36
border, I had lots of time
to think about what


997
0:39:1,36 --> 0:39:3,12
we'd seen in Chihuahua.


998
0:39:3,12 --> 0:39:4,4
I thought about the
LeBarons and the


999
0:39:4,4 --> 0:39:5,64
war against the narcos.


1000
0:39:5,64 --> 0:39:8,63
The kidnappings, the murders,
and the lengths they have to


1001
0:39:8,63 --> 0:39:11,54
go to protect themselves
every day.


1002
0:39:11,54 --> 0:39:13,98
I also thought about what Kelly
Romney had said about


1003
0:39:13,98 --> 0:39:15,73
the US being the swimming
pool and Mexico


1004
0:39:15,73 --> 0:39:17,1
being the diving board.


1005
0:39:17,1 --> 0:39:20,2
And how similar all this is
to America's history with


1006
0:39:20,2 --> 0:39:21,45
outlawing alcohol.


1007
0:39:21,45 --> 0:39:24,88



1008
0:39:24,88 --> 0:39:28,3
So we're just approaching the
border here back into America.


1009
0:39:28,3 --> 0:39:30,68
It feels like about a year
has passed since


1010
0:39:30,68 --> 0:39:31,84
we were here last.


1011
0:39:31,84 --> 0:39:35,5
As we were driving here from
Chihuahua, I was thinking


1012
0:39:35,5 --> 0:39:38,3
about how prohibition in America
led to the rise of the


1013
0:39:38,3 --> 0:39:40,64
mob, the Al Capones,
the Lucky Lucianos.


1014
0:39:40,64 --> 0:39:43,41
Our war on drugs, our
prohibition against drugs, has


1015
0:39:43,41 --> 0:39:44,35
caused the same thing.


1016
0:39:44,35 --> 0:39:45,54
You see it down here.


1017
0:39:45,54 --> 0:39:46,983
It's the sort of blunt
head to the hammer.


1018
0:39:46,983 --> 0:39:48,35
It's the rule of the thug.


1019
0:39:48,35 --> 0:39:50,12
You have $200 assassins.


1020
0:39:50,12 --> 0:39:52,17
And as long as there's
prohibition,


1021
0:39:52,17 --> 0:39:53,23
it's going to continue.


1022
0:39:53,23 --> 0:39:54,665
The war on drugs is a failure.


1023
0:39:54,665 --> 0:39:56,9
There's never been more drugs in
America, and they've never


1024
0:39:56,9 --> 0:39:57,34
been cheaper.


1025
0:39:57,34 --> 0:39:57,89
Or better.


1026
0:39:57,89 --> 0:39:59,88
Or higher quality.


1027
0:39:59,88 --> 0:40:2,15
And as we sat for hours at the
border waiting to get back


1028
0:40:2,15 --> 0:40:5,15
into America, I thought about
the fact that Mitt Romney


1029
0:40:5,15 --> 0:40:6,56
might just be the
next President


1030
0:40:6,56 --> 0:40:7,52
of the United States.


1031
0:40:7,52 --> 0:40:8,816
MITT ROMNEY: God
bless America.


1032
0:40:8,816 --> 0:40:10,55
Thanks, you guys.


1033
0:40:10,55 --> 0:40:13,1
SHANE SMITH: Now, polygamy and
kidnapping not withstanding,


1034
0:40:13,1 --> 0:40:16,42
if he wins, he's going to have
some hard decisions to make


1035
0:40:16,42 --> 0:40:18,55
about decriminalizing
drugs and fixing


1036
0:40:18,55 --> 0:40:19,92
our immigration problem.


1037
0:40:19,92 --> 0:40:23,62
Because if he doesn't, Mexico,
his Mormon brethren, and


1038
0:40:23,62 --> 0:40:25,97
perhaps even his own flesh
and blood, are


1039
0:40:25,97 --> 0:40:27,22
going to pay the price.


1040
0:40:27,22 --> 0:42:27,22
