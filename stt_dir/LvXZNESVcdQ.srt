0:0:3,68 --> 0:0:5,63
STEVE SPANGLER: So I woke up
this morning thinking about


3
0:0:5,63 --> 0:0:12,4
this, a little Alka-Seltzer
and some film canisters.


4
0:0:12,4 --> 0:0:14,68
Actually, it's something I
did in my son's fourth


5
0:0:14,68 --> 0:0:18,18
grade class last week.


6
0:0:18,18 --> 0:0:22,21
Imagine 25 kids dropping
Alka-Seltzer into this,


7
0:0:22,21 --> 0:0:25,42
another one of these like
this, and then just


8
0:0:25,42 --> 0:0:26,31
letting them go.


9
0:0:26,31 --> 0:0:27,54
Ready?


10
0:0:27,54 --> 0:0:28,17
Go!


11
0:0:28,17 --> 0:0:29,58
[MUSIC PLAYING]


12
0:0:29,58 --> 0:0:30,39
STEVE SPANGLER: Bam!


13
0:0:30,39 --> 0:0:32,2
There's one.


14
0:0:32,2 --> 0:0:33,19
Yikes!


15
0:0:33,19 --> 0:0:34,56
Come on.


16
0:0:34,56 --> 0:0:35,66
Why can't they all
go at one time?


17
0:0:35,66 --> 0:0:36,55
There's two.


18
0:0:36,55 --> 0:0:39,28
Now that was a cool one.


19
0:0:39,28 --> 0:0:41,98
See, what's stupid about that is
that, if you pop it in that


20
0:0:41,98 --> 0:0:44,71
direction, it just throws
water everywhere.


21
0:0:44,71 --> 0:0:46,65
And this is why kids
like this so much.


22
0:0:46,65 --> 0:0:49,0
So here I was in my son's
fourth grade class.


23
0:0:49,0 --> 0:0:51,21
And I'm showing them Newton's
law, because they're going to


24
0:0:51,21 --> 0:0:53,5
do this whole unit on rockets.


25
0:0:53,5 --> 0:0:54,56
And we're doing, for every
action, there's an equal and


26
0:0:54,56 --> 0:0:55,95
opposite reaction.


27
0:0:55,95 --> 0:0:59,32
And while I'm trying to show
them that, kids are wanting to


28
0:0:59,32 --> 0:1:1,466
find out what these are, because
they don't know what


29
0:1:1,466 --> 0:1:2,27
these little things are.


30
0:1:2,27 --> 0:1:3,95
And I'm calling them film
canisters, because that's what


31
0:1:3,95 --> 0:1:4,75
they're called.


32
0:1:4,75 --> 0:1:6,85
Little did I realize that, if
you're in fourth grade now,


33
0:1:6,85 --> 0:1:9,19
you've probably never
seen your parent use


34
0:1:9,19 --> 0:1:10,8
35 millimeter film.


35
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:13,3
You have no idea that it's
a film canister.


36
0:1:13,3 --> 0:1:15,66
This week, it's all about
flying film canisters.


37
0:1:15,66 --> 0:1:17,38
I want to show you some cool
things to be able to do with


38
0:1:17,38 --> 0:1:20,11
them, a way to be able to launch
a bunch of them at one


39
0:1:20,11 --> 0:1:22,86
time, and what happens if you
take it to an extreme level.


40
0:1:22,86 --> 0:1:24,75
While this is fun, what
if you could do this


41
0:1:24,75 --> 0:1:26,17
with a trash can?


42
0:1:26,17 --> 0:1:28,905
So here's everything you need,
just some Alka-Seltzer.


43
0:1:28,905 --> 0:1:30,9
You can find the
generic stuff.


44
0:1:30,9 --> 0:1:31,78
It's an effervescent tablet.


45
0:1:31,78 --> 0:1:33,615
You're going to need to have
some film canisters and, of


46
0:1:33,615 --> 0:1:34,73
course, some water.


47
0:1:34,73 --> 0:1:37,82
The cool thing about this is
that you get the reaction


48
0:1:37,82 --> 0:1:39,78
without using vinegar
and baking soda.


49
0:1:39,78 --> 0:1:42,3
So your traditional vinegar and
baking soda would work in


50
0:1:42,3 --> 0:1:45,11
here just fine, but this means
that the Alka-Seltzer tablet


51
0:1:45,11 --> 0:1:47,8
reacts with water.


52
0:1:47,8 --> 0:1:50,3
Inside the Alka-Seltzer tablet
is sodium bicarbonate, which


53
0:1:50,3 --> 0:1:51,1
is baking soda.


54
0:1:51,1 --> 0:1:53,6
But they also put some
powdered citric acid.


55
0:1:53,6 --> 0:1:56,74
And those two combined
dry are just fine.


56
0:1:56,74 --> 0:1:58,97
But they have to be careful of
these as they're packaging


57
0:1:58,97 --> 0:2:1,8
them, making sure there's no
moisture that gets in.


58
0:2:1,8 --> 0:2:2,88
You can always tell Alka-Seltzer
that has been


59
0:2:2,88 --> 0:2:6,41
tampered with and the moisture
has gotten inside, because the


60
0:2:6,41 --> 0:2:7,19
package will pop up.


61
0:2:7,19 --> 0:2:9,47
And many times, they'll explode
like those little--


62
0:2:9,47 --> 0:2:11,82
you know those packets that you
hit and the little bombs?


63
0:2:11,82 --> 0:2:12,6
And they get bigger
and bigger.


64
0:2:12,6 --> 0:2:14,4
And then they finally explode.


65
0:2:14,4 --> 0:2:15,255
So it's very, very simple.


66
0:2:15,255 --> 0:2:16,33
Of course, the water
goes inside.


67
0:2:16,33 --> 0:2:18,69
What's kind of cool is to just
vary the amount of water


68
0:2:18,69 --> 0:2:20,51
inside, because you want to
know what gives you the


69
0:2:20,51 --> 0:2:21,43
biggest bang.


70
0:2:21,43 --> 0:2:23,77
In this particular case, we
could even divide the tablet


71
0:2:23,77 --> 0:2:24,47
into quarters.


72
0:2:24,47 --> 0:2:26,96
There's still enough pressure
that's inside to


73
0:2:26,96 --> 0:2:28,13
be able to do this.


74
0:2:28,13 --> 0:2:29,46
And now we've got
the reaction.


75
0:2:29,46 --> 0:2:33,99
I could either figure out how
high the top pops off, or


76
0:2:33,99 --> 0:2:34,47
watch this.


77
0:2:34,47 --> 0:2:36,17
I can actually take a tube.


78
0:2:36,17 --> 0:2:37,78
So here's a little
plastic tube.


79
0:2:37,78 --> 0:2:40,82
This can go inside and go
upside down like this.


80
0:2:40,82 --> 0:2:44,27
So when it pops, ultimately,
the cap stays there.


81
0:2:44,27 --> 0:2:46,13
The entire lid comes off.


82
0:2:46,13 --> 0:2:48,16
And we get a nice little pop
that looks this way.


83
0:2:48,16 --> 0:2:49,41
If I do it the other way--


84
0:2:49,41 --> 0:2:51,95



85
0:2:51,95 --> 0:2:54,31
I think we took out a light.


86
0:2:54,31 --> 0:2:57,55
If we do it this way, then, of
course, then it just throws


87
0:2:57,55 --> 0:2:58,31
water everywhere.


88
0:2:58,31 --> 0:3:0,99
So this sits in and it--


89
0:3:0,99 --> 0:3:2,96
See, that's really cool,
because it shoots off.


90
0:3:2,96 --> 0:3:5,27
And so it's more like a little
rocket, which means this idea


91
0:3:5,27 --> 0:3:6,46
is fantastic as well.


92
0:3:6,46 --> 0:3:8,65
Look at this, just different
ways to be able to make it.


93
0:3:8,65 --> 0:3:10,44
Here's the film canister here.


94
0:3:10,44 --> 0:3:13,485
But you'll notice that there's
an actual pill vial here and,


95
0:3:13,485 --> 0:3:16,77
I don't know, some little thing
for the cap and some


96
0:3:16,77 --> 0:3:17,455
fins here on the side.


97
0:3:17,455 --> 0:3:18,57
So now watch.


98
0:3:18,57 --> 0:3:21,21
This will go in perfect.


99
0:3:21,21 --> 0:3:23,783
Now the Alka-Seltzer
goes in like this.


100
0:3:23,783 --> 0:3:24,53
Got it.


101
0:3:24,53 --> 0:3:25,825
The whole thing goes
upside down.


102
0:3:25,825 --> 0:3:27,876
And you're just going to
put the lid on, shake


103
0:3:27,876 --> 0:3:29,542
the whole thing up.


104
0:3:29,542 --> 0:3:31,45
Now you wait for that
bad boy to go.


105
0:3:31,45 --> 0:3:34,26
You can actually see the
bubbling inside.


106
0:3:34,26 --> 0:3:34,97
Newton was right.


107
0:3:34,97 --> 0:3:38,6
For every action, there's an
equal and opposite reaction.


108
0:3:38,6 --> 0:3:41,87
See, if that reaction is cool,
then it means that 10 of them


109
0:3:41,87 --> 0:3:43,47
at once would be fantastic.


110
0:3:43,47 --> 0:3:45,36
50 of them would be amazing.


111
0:3:45,36 --> 0:3:47,26
This just means that we
need more people.


112
0:3:47,26 --> 0:3:50,485
And I think I know where
to go get more people.


113
0:3:50,485 --> 0:3:51,87
All right, so here's the idea.


114
0:3:51,87 --> 0:3:54,27
I just want to launch a bunch
of them at one time.


115
0:3:54,27 --> 0:3:56,4
And I can't put them
down fast enough.


116
0:3:56,4 --> 0:3:59,5
That's why I've just asked a
few friends to stop doing


117
0:3:59,5 --> 0:4:2,27
their work making science
gadgets and to come and help


118
0:4:2,27 --> 0:4:2,81
me with this.


119
0:4:2,81 --> 0:4:3,15
Fair enough?


120
0:4:3,15 --> 0:4:4,67
All right, so everybody
around the table.


121
0:4:4,67 --> 0:4:7,31
Grab the new little canisters.


122
0:4:7,31 --> 0:4:8,39
Everybody grab one.


123
0:4:8,39 --> 0:4:8,73
Dump it out.


124
0:4:8,73 --> 0:4:9,7
Put the safety glasses on.


125
0:4:9,7 --> 0:4:11,185
You need safety glasses.


126
0:4:11,185 --> 0:4:14,43
And we'll fill them
up with water, OK?


127
0:4:14,43 --> 0:4:16,788
We couldn't find enough of these
film canisters, so we


128
0:4:16,788 --> 0:4:17,764
actually had them made.


129
0:4:17,764 --> 0:4:20,24
So these are film canisters,
believe it or not, that are


130
0:4:20,24 --> 0:4:23,5
made just to do what we're
talking about today.


131
0:4:23,5 --> 0:4:23,74
There you go.


132
0:4:23,74 --> 0:4:24,97
Here's some more.


133
0:4:24,97 --> 0:4:29,81
All right, half full, half full,
let's do, I don't know,


134
0:4:29,81 --> 0:4:30,325
15, 20 more?


135
0:4:30,325 --> 0:4:31,575
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

0:4:31,575 --> 0:4:34,326



137
0:4:34,326 --> 0:4:35,727
STEVE SPANGLER: Dump
those out.


138
0:4:35,727 --> 0:4:36,194
FEMALE SPEAKER: Those are hot.


139
0:4:36,194 --> 0:4:37,13
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, some are.


140
0:4:37,13 --> 0:4:38,921
Some aren't and some are--

[LAUGHTER]


142
0:4:39,37 --> 0:4:40,75
STEVE SPANGLER: Now you
just halve them.


143
0:4:40,75 --> 0:4:43,26
So you're going to need
half for each one.


144
0:4:43,26 --> 0:4:46,64
All right, on your marks,
get set, drop them in.


145
0:4:46,64 --> 0:4:48,41
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop.


146
0:4:48,41 --> 0:4:49,6
Drop them all in first.


147
0:4:49,6 --> 0:4:50,876
Cap them.


148
0:4:50,876 --> 0:4:51,71
Cap them.


149
0:4:51,71 --> 0:4:53,0
Oh, somebody's bad.


150
0:4:53,0 --> 0:4:54,464
Cap them.


151
0:4:54,464 --> 0:4:54,952
Cap them.


152
0:4:54,952 --> 0:4:55,44
And ready, set go!

155
0:4:59,344 --> 0:5:0,32
STEVE SPANGLER: Put
them upside down.


156

Go faster!

158
0:5:1,784 --> 0:5:3,248

[CHEERS]


161
0:5:8,128 --> 0:5:12,52
STEVE SPANGLER: That's
perfect.


162
0:5:12,52 --> 0:5:14,61
This is just a mess,
all right?


163
0:5:14,61 --> 0:5:17,71
So I was looking for huge
popping all over the place.


164
0:5:17,71 --> 0:5:19,63
This is what happens when
you can't launch them


165
0:5:19,63 --> 0:5:20,53
all at the same time.


166
0:5:20,53 --> 0:5:21,45
I have a friend, however.


167
0:5:21,45 --> 0:5:22,53
His name is Science Bob.


168
0:5:22,53 --> 0:5:25,2
And he claims to be able to do
a bunch of film canisters all


169
0:5:25,2 --> 0:5:26,24
at one time.


170
0:5:26,24 --> 0:5:28,14
And there's a little trick
he has with magnets.


171
0:5:28,14 --> 0:5:29,6
I think you'll like it.


172
0:5:29,6 --> 0:5:30,356
Take a look at this.


173
0:5:30,356 --> 0:5:32,92
SCIENCE BOB: With a little
creativity, I found a way that


174
0:5:32,92 --> 0:5:34,86
we actually just need
one person.


175
0:5:34,86 --> 0:5:37,5
A regular film canister
with the water in it.


176
0:5:37,5 --> 0:5:40,3
And then into that goes
this acrylic spacer.


177
0:5:40,3 --> 0:5:43,14
That will keep the tablet
separated from the water.


178
0:5:43,14 --> 0:5:44,49
The tablet goes on top.


179
0:5:44,49 --> 0:5:47,7
And then the cap goes on.


180
0:5:47,7 --> 0:5:49,92
And then a magnet goes on here,
which will put that on


181
0:5:49,92 --> 0:5:51,22
to the bottom of a board.


182
0:5:51,22 --> 0:5:54,4
And then all we've got to do
is flip the board over.


183
0:5:54,4 --> 0:5:56,5
And our chemicals will mix.


184
0:5:56,5 --> 0:5:59,45
But I don't think my classroom
has quite enough vertical


185
0:5:59,45 --> 0:6:0,25
space for this one.


186
0:6:0,25 --> 0:6:1,293
[MUSIC PLAYING]


187
0:6:1,293 --> 0:6:3,2
SCIENCE BOB: I've snuck
into the auditorium


188
0:6:3,2 --> 0:6:4,95
here to try this out.


189
0:6:4,95 --> 0:6:9,43
Underneath this board are 200
film canisters with the little


190
0:6:9,43 --> 0:6:11,58
spacer in them, the
Alka-Seltzer, and the water.


191
0:6:11,58 --> 0:6:13,53
When I flip this over,
they'll mix.


192
0:6:13,53 --> 0:6:16,74
And we should launch 200 of
these film canisters, more or


193
0:6:16,74 --> 0:6:18,2
less, again, all at once.


194
0:6:18,2 --> 0:6:19,4
Are you ready?


195
0:6:19,4 --> 0:6:21,26
Here we go.


196
0:6:21,26 --> 0:6:22,93
There they are.


197
0:6:22,93 --> 0:6:24,17
I'll flip them over.


198
0:6:24,17 --> 0:6:26,24
I'd better get out
of the way here.


199
0:6:26,24 --> 0:6:27,2
All right.


200
0:6:27,2 --> 0:6:27,82
Well, see?


201
0:6:27,82 --> 0:6:29,25
There's a little one.


202
0:6:29,25 --> 0:6:29,995
There they go.


203
0:6:29,995 --> 0:6:30,965
Oh, now they're going.


204
0:6:30,965 --> 0:6:31,935
That was good.


205
0:6:31,935 --> 0:6:32,905
Oh, that's awesome.


206
0:6:32,905 --> 0:6:34,36
Look at that.


207
0:6:34,36 --> 0:6:36,3
That's crazy.


208
0:6:36,3 --> 0:6:36,461
Oh my gosh.


209
0:6:36,461 --> 0:6:37,711
Look at that.


210
0:6:37,711 --> 0:6:40,67



211
0:6:40,67 --> 0:6:41,23
See?


212
0:6:41,23 --> 0:6:43,14
Just one last one.


213
0:6:43,14 --> 0:6:44,14
All right.


214
0:6:44,14 --> 0:6:45,99
That was awesome.


215
0:6:45,99 --> 0:6:48,67
Where do you guys
keep the brooms?


216
0:6:48,67 --> 0:6:49,63
Brooms?


217
0:6:49,63 --> 0:6:50,59
Are they over here?


218
0:6:50,59 --> 0:6:52,3
Brooms?


219
0:6:52,3 --> 0:6:54,83
STEVE SPANGLER: All right, as
cool as Science Bob's idea is


220
0:6:54,83 --> 0:6:57,88
for launching all those film
canisters at one time, I had a


221
0:6:57,88 --> 0:6:59,84
television producer here
recently that wanted me to


222
0:6:59,84 --> 0:7:3,14
launch the can, but this
is the can that he


223
0:7:3,14 --> 0:7:4,33
wanted me to launch.


224
0:7:4,33 --> 0:7:5,48
This is a trash can.


225
0:7:5,48 --> 0:7:7,81
And I don't care how much
Alka-Seltzer you try to put in


226
0:7:7,81 --> 0:7:10,72
there, what kind of seal you can
get across the top, I just


227
0:7:10,72 --> 0:7:12,72
couldn't get a good launch
on something like this.


228
0:7:12,72 --> 0:7:14,67
So we headed out to
the parking lot.


229
0:7:14,67 --> 0:7:16,7
And the other thing that we
thought that we would use to


230
0:7:16,7 --> 0:7:18,42
launch it, since the
Alka-Seltzer is nothing but


231
0:7:18,42 --> 0:7:21,315
compressed air, actually,
compressed carbon dioxide, we


232
0:7:21,315 --> 0:7:23,9
thought, could we compress air
in such a way that we could


233
0:7:23,9 --> 0:7:26,21
cause this to launch
up into the air.


234
0:7:26,21 --> 0:7:28,53
We knew that most of the air
is made of nitrogen, so why


235
0:7:28,53 --> 0:7:29,95
not launch it with nitrogen?


236
0:7:29,95 --> 0:7:31,77
It's not going to be bad
for the environment.


237
0:7:31,77 --> 0:7:34,54
The only problem is you've got
to change it from a gas to a


238
0:7:34,54 --> 0:7:36,72
liquid and allow it to expand.


239
0:7:36,72 --> 0:7:38,38
This is the part of the program
I have to tell you,


240
0:7:38,38 --> 0:7:39,93
don't try this at home.


241
0:7:39,93 --> 0:7:43,1
We got this video footage,
because we videotape


242
0:7:43,1 --> 0:7:46,8
everything that we do for
television and send it to the


243
0:7:46,8 --> 0:7:47,9
producers and get
their approval.


244
0:7:47,9 --> 0:7:50,28
So what you're about to see
was actually filmed in our


245
0:7:50,28 --> 0:7:51,2
parking lot.


246
0:7:51,2 --> 0:7:52,77
And we just let the
cameras roll.


247
0:7:52,77 --> 0:7:53,81
And well, take a look.


248
0:7:53,81 --> 0:7:55,304
Here's what happened.


249
0:7:55,304 --> 0:7:56,3
OK, ready?


250
0:7:56,3 --> 0:7:57,8
Let's try it out.


251
0:7:57,8 --> 0:7:58,22
OK, here's what's
going to happen.


252
0:7:58,22 --> 0:7:59,77
We're going to take
it over there.


253
0:7:59,77 --> 0:8:0,265
We're going to cap it.


254
0:8:0,265 --> 0:8:2,74
And then we're going
to drop it in.


255
0:8:2,74 --> 0:8:3,73
Ready?


256
0:8:3,73 --> 0:8:4,225
OK.
