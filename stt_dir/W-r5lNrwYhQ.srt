0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,42



2
0:0:10,42 --> 0:0:13,84
CHRIS ROACH: I see it taking a
different image than lately,


3
0:0:13,84 --> 0:0:15,9
kind of more skateboard
influenced.


4
0:0:15,9 --> 0:0:18,32
People are going to start
doing some shit.


5
0:0:18,32 --> 0:0:20,82
I think for sure that people
were milking snowboarding


6
0:0:20,82 --> 0:0:22,51
because snowboarding is fucking
easy, and they were


7
0:0:22,51 --> 0:0:25,0
making money off of nothing
doing nothing.


8
0:0:25,0 --> 0:0:26,29
And I think it was
starting to show.


9
0:0:26,29 --> 0:0:29,93
And those people that got cut
for that shouldn't have been


10
0:0:29,93 --> 0:0:31,582
making money anyway, you know?


11
0:0:31,582 --> 0:0:34,24



12
0:0:34,24 --> 0:0:36,52
My main influence in
snowboarding was


13
0:0:36,52 --> 0:0:39,34
probably Mike Ranquet.


14
0:0:39,34 --> 0:0:40,48
I met Mike.


15
0:0:40,48 --> 0:0:43,98
Once I met Mike, we had the
same kind of backgrounds.


16
0:0:43,98 --> 0:0:47,24
And we felt the same way
about snowboarding.


17
0:0:47,24 --> 0:0:49,29
We didn't take it as seriously
as a lot of the


18
0:0:49,29 --> 0:0:49,99
other people did.


19
0:0:49,99 --> 0:0:51,43
We didn't care about contests.


20
0:0:51,43 --> 0:0:55,21
We just felt like, I guess,
skateboarding on the snow.


21
0:0:55,21 --> 0:0:57,99
We weren't trying to win
everything or whatnot.


22
0:0:57,99 --> 0:0:59,36
And Mike just ripped.


23
0:0:59,36 --> 0:1:1,87
To this day, I think Mike's
one of the best


24
0:1:1,87 --> 0:1:3,4
snowboarders out there.


25
0:1:3,4 --> 0:1:5,74
He just does so many
great things.


26
0:1:5,74 --> 0:1:7,56
MIKE RANQUET: God, I think
I met Roach in Colorado


27
0:1:7,56 --> 0:1:8,76
on some Sims trip.


28
0:1:8,76 --> 0:1:9,96
And we just hit it off.


29
0:1:9,96 --> 0:1:12,45
We were like two
peas in a pod.


30
0:1:12,45 --> 0:1:16,27
We had the same ideals
of snowboarding.


31
0:1:16,27 --> 0:1:19,78
When you go to Europe in
1989, you're the only


32
0:1:19,78 --> 0:1:20,74
person in soft boots.


33
0:1:20,74 --> 0:1:23,48
It's like me and Craig Kelly
and Palmer and a


34
0:1:23,48 --> 0:1:24,6
couple other guys.


35
0:1:24,6 --> 0:1:25,94
We were the only people
in soft boots.


36
0:1:25,94 --> 0:1:28,29
Everyone was in ski boots,
you know what I mean?


37
0:1:28,29 --> 0:1:31,51
And meeting Roach was like a
breath of fresh air, because


38
0:1:31,51 --> 0:1:34,68
it was like he dressed proper.


39
0:1:34,68 --> 0:1:37,59
And he was concerned
with style.


40
0:1:37,59 --> 0:1:41,8
Whereas other people just wanted
to do method airs and


41
0:1:41,8 --> 0:1:43,31
get their arm up like that
and stuff like that.


42
0:1:43,31 --> 0:1:46,62
We wanted to grab the board
behind your foot or right in


43
0:1:46,62 --> 0:1:52,41
front of your foot, and not
gay it out, you know?


44
0:1:52,41 --> 0:1:55,175
CHRIS ROACH: We went to the
Sim's camp together, I think.


45
0:1:55,175 --> 0:1:58,465
And everybody was training
or something.


46
0:1:58,465 --> 0:2:2,17
And me and Mikey were just like,
dude, we can do cabs.


47
0:2:2,17 --> 0:2:4,68
We can go switch and
do switch tricks.


48
0:2:4,68 --> 0:2:8,9
And I remember talking with
Shaun later, he's like what


49
0:2:8,9 --> 0:2:11,26
the fuck dude, you guys are
doing cabs now on snow


50
0:2:11,26 --> 0:2:11,76
and all this shit.


51
0:2:11,76 --> 0:2:14,66
It was just like skateboarding
all over again.


52
0:2:14,66 --> 0:2:18,13
It's so early in snowboarding
that going fakey or whatever


53
0:2:18,13 --> 0:2:21,39
was like a new step
in snowboarding.


54
0:2:21,39 --> 0:2:23,44
It was just a new progression,
I guess.


55
0:2:23,44 --> 0:2:25,36
But crazy they weren't
doing it before.


56
0:2:25,36 --> 0:2:27,83
I'm sure they were, though,
Terry and all those guys.


57
0:2:27,83 --> 0:2:30,94
But I think we started doing
different tricks.


58
0:2:30,94 --> 0:2:31,84
Yeah, I think-- well,
I don't know.


59
0:2:31,84 --> 0:2:33,7
Mikey was pretty on
top of everything.


60
0:2:33,7 --> 0:2:36,67
He probably brought it to
me first, to be honest.


61
0:2:36,67 --> 0:2:38,5
TODD RICHARDS: Who is my
favorite snowboarder?


62
0:2:38,5 --> 0:2:41,17
I would say it was, back
in that time, it


63
0:2:41,17 --> 0:2:42,52
was Roach, for sure.


64
0:2:42,52 --> 0:2:44,16
I mean, he was definitely--


65
0:2:44,16 --> 0:2:48,31
between Roach and Ranquet
because those were two guys


66
0:2:48,31 --> 0:2:49,445
that both skated.


67
0:2:49,445 --> 0:2:55,54
And as far as doing tricks and
things, they were grabbing and


68
0:2:55,54 --> 0:2:56,98
holding longer than
anybody else.


69
0:2:56,98 --> 0:3:4,21
It was insane to see that coming
from like-- you know,


70
0:3:4,21 --> 0:3:7,3
we weren't doing half cabs
and all that stuff.


71
0:3:7,3 --> 0:3:9,73
We were kind of just doing
this weird like kick out


72
0:3:9,73 --> 0:3:10,72
things off mobiles.


73
0:3:10,72 --> 0:3:13,91
And then I remember I was
at the US Open in 1990--


74
0:3:13,91 --> 0:3:15,6
or no, '89.


75
0:3:15,6 --> 0:3:17,87
And we were riding up the
gondola at Stratton.


76
0:3:17,87 --> 0:3:23,2
And I looked down, and it was
Roach, Ranquet, Keith Wallace,


77
0:3:23,2 --> 0:3:27,58
Tucker Fransen, and some other
random dudes that were from


78
0:3:27,58 --> 0:3:30,4
like Tahoe-- maybe Monte,
Chris's brother, were all


79
0:3:30,4 --> 0:3:33,12
riding under the gondola,
like just half


80
0:3:33,12 --> 0:3:34,21
cabbing off the knolls.


81
0:3:34,21 --> 0:3:35,79
And we were just like, what?


82
0:3:35,79 --> 0:3:37,32
We had never seen that before.


83
0:3:37,32 --> 0:3:40,19
And that's all we tried to do
after that day, was like


84
0:3:40,19 --> 0:3:42,4
imitate that, you know?


85
0:3:42,4 --> 0:3:44,88
MIKE RANQUET: Yeah, we just
started doing like out of the


86
0:3:44,88 --> 0:3:46,89
end of the pipe in Breckenridge
and at the US


87
0:3:46,89 --> 0:3:48,3
Open that year.


88
0:3:48,3 --> 0:3:53,4
Just switch tricks basically,
what is now switch tricks.


89
0:3:53,4 --> 0:3:54,49
But it was only me and Roach.


90
0:3:54,49 --> 0:3:56,85
It wasn't like a couple
other people.


91
0:3:56,85 --> 0:3:58,68
It was like maybe Duck
Boy was in there.


92
0:3:58,68 --> 0:4:3,73
But he was way more into like
the pipe, whereas I started to


93
0:4:3,73 --> 0:4:5,6
look at the whole mountain.


94
0:4:5,6 --> 0:4:11,97
Like Roachy and I, it felt like
we were the only ones


95
0:4:11,97 --> 0:4:15,26
carrying the flag of the
skateboarding, you know?


96
0:4:15,26 --> 0:4:18,279
And then just having Noah then
Cardiel kind of come


97
0:4:18,279 --> 0:4:19,86
on board, you know.


98
0:4:19,86 --> 0:4:23,53
It helped legitimize it in
skating too because up to that


99
0:4:23,53 --> 0:4:26,95
point, I wouldn't even really
admit I was a snowboarder


100
0:4:26,95 --> 0:4:28,55
among certain circles.


101
0:4:28,55 --> 0:4:32,11
It might come out, but then, OK,
not all snowboarders are


102
0:4:32,11 --> 0:4:34,65
gay by birth, you know.


103
0:4:34,65 --> 0:4:39,14
Because at that time, I won't
name names, but just goofy


104
0:4:39,14 --> 0:4:43,1
outfits, jester hats, and
might as well have been


105
0:4:43,1 --> 0:4:44,94
juggling up there or something,
you know?


106
0:4:44,94 --> 0:4:50,15
Like neon, and it was
just bad, you know?


107
0:4:50,15 --> 0:4:51,5
CHRIS ROACH: I don't
know because I


108
0:4:51,5 --> 0:4:53,18
wasn't really a skier.


109
0:4:53,18 --> 0:4:55,1
And that was isn't background.


110
0:4:55,1 --> 0:4:58,95
And I don't know where all
the DayGlo came from.


111
0:4:58,95 --> 0:5:1,28
Wave Rave didn't help
that situation.


112
0:5:1,28 --> 0:5:5,96
But it just didn't fit with
me and where I was.


113
0:5:5,96 --> 0:5:10,81
I mean, black looked better on
snow than bright yellow did.


114
0:5:10,81 --> 0:5:14,67
And that was more my attitude
and how I felt.


115
0:5:14,67 --> 0:5:17,88
But I think a lot of guys make
good money off wearing DayGlo.


116
0:5:17,88 --> 0:5:19,59
Damian did very well
for himself.


117
0:5:19,59 --> 0:5:22,83
So whatever, that's
good for him.


118
0:5:22,83 --> 0:5:25,91
There was plenty of guys that
would wear the DayGlo, so


119
0:5:25,91 --> 0:5:29,5
there was no shortage of that.


120
0:5:29,5 --> 0:5:30,45
JP WALKER: Just his fashion
at the time,


121
0:5:30,45 --> 0:5:31,4
too, was pretty sick.


122
0:5:31,4 --> 0:5:32,76
Like with those big--


123
0:5:32,76 --> 0:5:35,58
I don't know if they were Oakley
Frogskins or something,


124
0:5:35,58 --> 0:5:40,26
rainbow, tan, and big bleached
hair, and all


125
0:5:40,26 --> 0:5:41,31
grown out and stuff.


126
0:5:41,31 --> 0:5:45,77
And just the way he even talked,
too, was so like


127
0:5:45,77 --> 0:5:50,1
snowboard speak, like decent
pokes in the pipe.


128
0:5:50,1 --> 0:5:51,74
I don't know, Brushie used
to talk like that, too.


129
0:5:51,74 --> 0:5:55,68
But I don't know, it was
pretty sick, his whole


130
0:5:55,68 --> 0:5:56,93
everything.


131
0:5:56,93 --> 0:5:58,98



132
0:5:58,98 --> 0:6:1,78
DAVE SEOANE: And, I don't know
if you guys know this, but I


133
0:6:1,78 --> 0:6:3,2
think it was like Tucker
Fransen and


134
0:6:3,2 --> 0:6:4,7
Chris Roach who actually--


135
0:6:4,7 --> 0:6:7,2
the traditional method airs,
when you pull it out and you


136
0:6:7,2 --> 0:6:11,14
poke your leg way out,
traditionally that was called


137
0:6:11,14 --> 0:6:11,71
the grasser.


138
0:6:11,71 --> 0:6:15,22
And that was because of Chris
Roach and Tucker Fransen.


139
0:6:15,22 --> 0:6:16,41
The grasser.


140
0:6:16,41 --> 0:6:19,4
CHRIS ROACH: I coined it up
here because a lot of my


141
0:6:19,4 --> 0:6:21,9
friends, we're all from
Grass Valley here.


142
0:6:21,9 --> 0:6:25,39
And like I said, Shaun and Terry
did the best backside


143
0:6:25,39 --> 0:6:26,35
airs known to man.


144
0:6:26,35 --> 0:6:29,85
And so we all did them mimicking
those two guys.


145
0:6:29,85 --> 0:6:32,97
And we called it the grasser
because everybody from Grass


146
0:6:32,97 --> 0:6:34,41
Valley had to do it
like those guys.


147
0:6:34,41 --> 0:6:37,595
So now it's like the
grasser, you know?


148
0:6:37,595 --> 0:6:42,54
You know who knows how to do a
backside air and who doesn't.


149
0:6:42,54 --> 0:6:46,1
I mean, even to this day, you
can see someone do a fucking


150
0:6:46,1 --> 0:6:49,9
method air, and I wouldn't
call it a backside air or


151
0:6:49,9 --> 0:6:50,31
grasser either way.


152
0:6:50,31 --> 0:6:53,52
I mean, that's one of the good
things, is if you have to


153
0:6:53,52 --> 0:6:55,64
explain it, then you're
not doing it.


154
0:6:55,64 --> 0:6:58,48
So either you know you're doing
it right, or you're not.


155
0:6:58,48 --> 0:7:0,0
You do whatever feels good.


156
0:7:0,0 --> 0:7:2,28
If the method feels good, so
be it, and thanks for not


157
0:7:2,28 --> 0:7:3,53
doing the grasser.


158
0:7:3,53 --> 0:7:5,61



159
0:7:5,61 --> 0:7:8,31
Jamie does grassers.


160
0:7:8,31 --> 0:7:10,56
He knows the feelings.


161
0:7:10,56 --> 0:7:14,39
JAMIE LYNN: You know, when I'm
in Tahoe, I'm doing grassers.


162
0:7:14,39 --> 0:7:18,7
Any place else, I'm kicking
out a method.


163
0:7:18,7 --> 0:7:21,17
Those guys grew up watching
Kidwell at the Tahoe Donner


164
0:7:21,17 --> 0:7:25,16
quarter pipe kicking out
killer skate methods.


165
0:7:25,16 --> 0:7:27,8
And they were the generation
kind of just a


166
0:7:27,8 --> 0:7:28,64
nick before I was.


167
0:7:28,64 --> 0:7:35,78
So Roach had one of the
sickest grassers ever.


168
0:7:35,78 --> 0:7:37,23
He was a big influence.


169
0:7:37,23 --> 0:7:39,92
He probably doesn't get as much
credit as he deserves for


170
0:7:39,92 --> 0:7:44,22
being influential on
a backside method.


171
0:7:44,22 --> 0:7:45,47
Grasser.


172
0:7:45,47 --> 0:7:47,33



173
0:7:47,33 --> 0:7:50,44
Thanks, Chris.


174
0:7:50,44 --> 0:7:52,86
CHRIS ROACH: My favorite trick
right now is grasser reverts.


175
0:7:52,86 --> 0:7:53,55
Made it up.


176
0:7:53,55 --> 0:7:54,8
I don't know.


177
0:7:54,8 --> 0:7:54,88
No one else does it.


178
0:7:54,88 --> 0:7:56,36
It's pretty cool.


179
0:7:56,36 --> 0:7:57,61
-How does it work?


180
0:7:57,61 --> 0:8:0,79
CHRIS ROACH: You go backside
wall, do a grasser, then keep


181
0:8:0,79 --> 0:8:1,39
rotating it.


182
0:8:1,39 --> 0:8:3,63
Over-rotate it and land fakey.


183
0:8:3,63 --> 0:8:4,51
It's pretty cool.


184
0:8:4,51 --> 0:8:6,33
And you poke to fakeys
over-rotating,


185
0:8:6,33 --> 0:8:8,17
those are good, too.


186
0:8:8,17 --> 0:8:8,94
JP WALKER: Yeah, grasser
reverts.


187
0:8:8,94 --> 0:8:10,29
I made them up.


188
0:8:10,29 --> 0:8:12,87
No one's doing but me, or
something like that.


189
0:8:12,87 --> 0:8:15,91



190
0:8:15,91 --> 0:8:16,94
I didn't even notice
it back then.


191
0:8:16,94 --> 0:8:19,46
But it seems like if somebody
said something like that now,


192
0:8:19,46 --> 0:8:22,0
they'd just be so crucified
by everyone


193
0:8:22,0 --> 0:8:23,62
else, like what a claimer.


194
0:8:23,62 --> 0:8:24,43
You know what I mean?


195
0:8:24,43 --> 0:8:28,29
So it's kind of funny because
I just watched that


196
0:8:28,29 --> 0:8:29,245
not too long ago.


197
0:8:29,245 --> 0:8:31,3
And I was laughing so hard
about what he was


198
0:8:31,3 --> 0:8:32,7
saying about that.


199
0:8:32,7 --> 0:8:33,799
It was pretty sick.


200
0:8:33,799 --> 0:8:37,89
CHRIS ROACH: We were filming
for Dogger's movies up in


201
0:8:37,89 --> 0:8:38,669
Mount Hood.


202
0:8:38,669 --> 0:8:41,15
And Dogger's the kind of guy
who's like yeah, that's pretty


203
0:8:41,15 --> 0:8:42,7
sick, but I know you
got more in you.


204
0:8:42,7 --> 0:8:43,3
You know?


205
0:8:43,3 --> 0:8:44,81
You got to start bringing
that thing around or


206
0:8:44,81 --> 0:8:45,73
do something else.


207
0:8:45,73 --> 0:8:48,69
And I was like, well, dude,
what about backside 360s?


208
0:8:48,69 --> 0:8:50,63
We'll do grasser and
turn it around.


209
0:8:50,63 --> 0:8:52,93
He's like do it, do it.


210
0:8:52,93 --> 0:8:55,13
So that's when it started
up in Mount Hood.


211
0:8:55,13 --> 0:8:57,92
And during the summer, we
started doing those.


212
0:8:57,92 --> 0:9:0,89
I think I was the only one
doing them that day.


213
0:9:0,89 --> 0:9:2,64
Obviously, Noah and all those
guys started doing


214
0:9:2,64 --> 0:9:3,58
them right away too.


215
0:9:3,58 --> 0:9:8,51
But I think Dogger pushed me
into doing them that day.


216
0:9:8,51 --> 0:9:11,82
It was good when Santa Cruz
called and said they were


217
0:9:11,82 --> 0:9:15,39
going to make snowboards,
you know, super excited.


218
0:9:15,39 --> 0:9:18,34
Joel Gomez was the
team manager.


219
0:9:18,34 --> 0:9:21,44
Me, Mike Ranquet, and John
Cardiel were the first riders.


220
0:9:21,44 --> 0:9:24,18
And to me, that was
an all time team.


221
0:9:24,18 --> 0:9:26,76
I was so excited to have
that as a team.


222
0:9:26,76 --> 0:9:29,55
And I remember telling Joel, I
was like man, whatever we do,


223
0:9:29,55 --> 0:9:30,93
we've got to keep this
team together.


224
0:9:30,93 --> 0:9:35,3
This is a great, great team for
this time in the sport.


225
0:9:35,3 --> 0:9:37,51
There's not that much skateboard
influence, and we


226
0:9:37,51 --> 0:9:38,57
could take this long way.


227
0:9:38,57 --> 0:9:40,99
And it fell apart right away.


228
0:9:40,99 --> 0:9:43,25
Santa Cruz just didn't have the
money, or didn't want to


229
0:9:43,25 --> 0:9:46,7
pay those boys what they
needed to make.


230
0:9:46,7 --> 0:9:49,83
And I stayed, and was happy to
stay, but I sure would have


231
0:9:49,83 --> 0:9:52,54
liked to have them on as
teammates a couple more years


232
0:9:52,54 --> 0:9:53,67
or whatever.


233
0:9:53,67 --> 0:9:55,26
MIKE RANQUET: I rode for
Sessions at the time.


234
0:9:55,26 --> 0:9:57,13
And so did Roach.


235
0:9:57,13 --> 0:10:0,22
And Sessions didn't
even close then.


236
0:10:0,22 --> 0:10:2,16
It was like the coolest
shop sponsor to have.


237
0:10:2,16 --> 0:10:5,43
And Santa Cruz hired Joel
as a team manager.


238
0:10:5,43 --> 0:10:7,0
And yes, so it just
made sense.


239
0:10:7,0 --> 0:10:11,12
Santa Cruz snowboards sponsor
Roach and Ranquet, you know?


240
0:10:11,12 --> 0:10:14,2
And that to us was so cool
because Santa Cruz was


241
0:10:14,2 --> 0:10:14,89
so cool back then.


242
0:10:14,89 --> 0:10:16,76
But their snowboard division
got taken over by the


243
0:10:16,76 --> 0:10:19,8
Europeans, and all of a sudden,
the snowboarding side


244
0:10:19,8 --> 0:10:21,86
of Santa Cruz wasn't as
cool as we thought it


245
0:10:21,86 --> 0:10:22,61
would be, you know?


246
0:10:22,61 --> 0:10:25,44
So we're not dealing with NHS,
like Independent Trucks, Santa


247
0:10:25,44 --> 0:10:26,39
Cruz skateboards.


248
0:10:26,39 --> 0:10:26,95
We're not dealing with that.


249
0:10:26,95 --> 0:10:29,75
We're dealing with some hotshot


250
0:10:29,75 --> 0:10:31,38
racer guys from Europe.


251
0:10:31,38 --> 0:10:35,83
And so when we got kicked out
of Japan, that was over the


252
0:10:35,83 --> 0:10:36,59
top for them.


253
0:10:36,59 --> 0:10:40,6
They were just like,
fuck that.


254
0:10:40,6 --> 0:10:41,31
-Easter man.


255
0:10:41,31 --> 0:10:46,99



256
0:10:46,99 --> 0:10:47,63
-Or Ted Martin?


257
0:10:47,63 --> 0:10:50,49
Is that the guy?


258
0:10:50,49 --> 0:10:51,83
JERRY DUGAN: Yeah, so
Ranquet rode for


259
0:10:51,83 --> 0:10:53,87
pretty much the shitsters.


260
0:10:53,87 --> 0:10:54,63
They were the worst.


261
0:10:54,63 --> 0:10:56,51
I mean, they're the two that
got kicked out of Japan.


262
0:10:56,51 --> 0:10:59,78
And they were together,
just like bad news.


263
0:10:59,78 --> 0:11:1,72
A food fight happened
in an area that


264
0:11:1,72 --> 0:11:4,17
shouldn't have happened.


265
0:11:4,17 --> 0:11:5,46
And it was stupid.


266
0:11:5,46 --> 0:11:8,19
They were just drunk
and being dumb.


267
0:11:8,19 --> 0:11:10,25
But it wasn't like they got
their hands slapped.


268
0:11:10,25 --> 0:11:12,24
They basically got kicked off
the property, kicked out of


269
0:11:12,24 --> 0:11:14,85
Japan, and sent home.


270
0:11:14,85 --> 0:11:18,19
Yeah, the Japanese had a little
different understanding


271
0:11:18,19 --> 0:11:21,63
of what should be appropriate
or not appropriate behavior.


272
0:11:21,63 --> 0:11:22,64
DAMIAN SANDERS: They were pretty
serious over there.


273
0:11:22,64 --> 0:11:24,585
And it's funny how they can kick
you out of their country.


274
0:11:24,585 --> 0:11:26,285
Like around here, they
might put you in jail


275
0:11:26,285 --> 0:11:27,25
or give you a ticket.


276
0:11:27,25 --> 0:11:30,9
But they rounded them up and
actually escorted them to the


277
0:11:30,9 --> 0:11:33,866
airport and got them on a
plane and said see ya.


278
0:11:33,866 --> 0:11:35,842
[LAUGHTER]


279
0:11:35,842 --> 0:11:38,312
-You got to film getting
on the bus, dude.


280
0:11:38,312 --> 0:11:41,77
You got to walk out, Mike.


281
0:11:41,77 --> 0:11:43,746
-Where's Roach?


282
0:11:43,746 --> 0:11:47,204
-The rubber frog
incident, bro.


283
0:11:47,204 --> 0:11:48,686
Gonna miss you.


284
0:11:48,686 --> 0:11:54,12



285
0:11:54,12 --> 0:11:55,108
-Bye, guys!


286
0:11:55,108 --> 0:11:56,59
-I love you.


287
0:11:56,59 --> 0:11:57,578
-Bye, guys!


288
0:11:57,578 --> 0:11:59,8
-Bye, guys!


289
0:11:59,8 --> 0:12:2,61
MIKE RANQUET: I mean, it
wasn't any part due to


290
0:12:2,61 --> 0:12:4,45
anything Joel did or said.


291
0:12:4,45 --> 0:12:6,67
He was just the messenger,
you know what I mean?


292
0:12:6,67 --> 0:12:9,55
He felt bad for both sides
because he saw that you can


293
0:12:9,55 --> 0:12:12,53
capitalize on these kids, but
he also saw that in their


294
0:12:12,53 --> 0:12:15,62
eyes, we blew it, 100%.


295
0:12:15,62 --> 0:12:18,27
We got kicked off the World
Cup tour forever.


296
0:12:18,27 --> 0:12:19,26
We get kicked out of Japan.


297
0:12:19,26 --> 0:12:22,49
And I also knew, and I tried
to tell Chris at the time,


298
0:12:22,49 --> 0:12:24,91
like Santa Cruz ain't
going to back you.


299
0:12:24,91 --> 0:12:27,2
They're not at all.


300
0:12:27,2 --> 0:12:28,97
They're going to brush
you under the rug.


301
0:12:28,97 --> 0:12:30,6
And they did.


302
0:12:30,6 --> 0:12:34,7
But Roach, out of pride,
just like NorCal, dude.


303
0:12:34,7 --> 0:12:35,7
You know?


304
0:12:35,7 --> 0:12:37,43
Like, Santa Cruz.


305
0:12:37,43 --> 0:12:40,97
And I wish I could still feel
that then, because I kind of


306
0:12:40,97 --> 0:12:44,25
did, only because of the
camaraderie of Roach and I.


307
0:12:44,25 --> 0:12:48,5
But the other thing was I found
I could hang out with


308
0:12:48,5 --> 0:12:48,44
Roach more.


309
0:12:48,44 --> 0:12:50,51
Because at the end of Santa
Cruz, they didn't want us


310
0:12:50,51 --> 0:12:51,41
hanging out together.


311
0:12:51,41 --> 0:12:53,26
They wouldn't put us
on trips together.


312
0:12:53,26 --> 0:12:54,35
You know what I mean?


313
0:12:54,35 --> 0:12:55,85
And all of a sudden,
I was like, killer.


314
0:12:55,85 --> 0:12:57,29
I can go hang out with Roach.


315
0:12:57,29 --> 0:13:0,38
There's no weird
binding thing.


316
0:13:0,38 --> 0:13:3,58
But it was just kind of like too
bad to watch Roach at the


317
0:13:3,58 --> 0:13:8,45
height of his riding and kind
of image just get a wet


318
0:13:8,45 --> 0:13:10,29
blanket put over him
by his sponsor.


319
0:13:10,29 --> 0:13:14,21
They gave him a pro model, but
they didn't promote it.


320
0:13:14,21 --> 0:13:14,68
You know what I mean?


321
0:13:14,68 --> 0:13:17,34
So Roach probably sold one board
for every five of mine,


322
0:13:17,34 --> 0:13:21,92
which then Noah sold probably 10
for every one of mine, you


323
0:13:21,92 --> 0:13:22,28
know what I mean?


324
0:13:22,28 --> 0:13:25,6
So me and Noah had these
successful pro models.


325
0:13:25,6 --> 0:13:30,69
And Roach's was successful, but
they didn't promote it.


326
0:13:30,69 --> 0:13:33,98
It's like a band having
a record contract.


327
0:13:33,98 --> 0:13:35,62
And then all of a sudden, the
record company ain't going to


328
0:13:35,62 --> 0:13:36,64
promote their record.


329
0:13:36,64 --> 0:13:40,28
It's going to sell, but not as
well as with advertising,


330
0:13:40,28 --> 0:13:41,285
blah, blah, blah.


331
0:13:41,285 --> 0:13:43,2
CHRIS ROACH: You know, I kind of
went full circle, and now I


332
0:13:43,2 --> 0:13:44,39
have another model with them.


333
0:13:44,39 --> 0:13:47,96
And I get to still be involved
in Santa Cruz.


334
0:13:47,96 --> 0:13:51,61
So Santa Cruz definitely has
given me a good life.


335
0:13:51,61 --> 0:13:56,0
And they've always been behind
me, and I appreciate that.


336
0:13:56,0 --> 0:13:58,14
MIKE RANQUET: After the Japan
incident where we both got


337
0:13:58,14 --> 0:14:2,38
kicked out, I went back to
Japan the next year.


338
0:14:2,38 --> 0:14:3,67
He never went back.


339
0:14:3,67 --> 0:14:4,76
But he was fine with that.


340
0:14:4,76 --> 0:14:6,27
He was cool just
not traveling.


341
0:14:6,27 --> 0:14:8,8
He just didn't care, you know?


342
0:14:8,8 --> 0:14:9,885
He was like, dude, I just want
to kick it at home in Tahoe,


343
0:14:9,885 --> 0:14:12,17
go to Grass Valley, smoke pot.


344
0:14:12,17 --> 0:14:13,26
You know?


345
0:14:13,26 --> 0:14:14,22
That's pretty funny.


346
0:14:14,22 --> 0:14:17,25
This guy's got the opportunity
to go anywhere in the world,


347
0:14:17,25 --> 0:14:18,75
he's like eh, you know?


348
0:14:18,75 --> 0:14:21,16
Like, yawn.


349
0:14:21,16 --> 0:14:22,78
CHRIS ROACH: If you're a
professional snowboarder and


350
0:14:22,78 --> 0:14:24,91
you got to just do videos,
I think that in


351
0:14:24,91 --> 0:14:27,52
itself was a statement.


352
0:14:27,52 --> 0:14:28,9
You know, you didn't
have to deal with


353
0:14:28,9 --> 0:14:30,14
the pressure of contests.


354
0:14:30,14 --> 0:14:34,94
You didn't have to go to all the
shitty resorts and spend


355
0:14:34,94 --> 0:14:35,94
your time doing that.


356
0:14:35,94 --> 0:14:38,51
You could chase the snow
and the weather and


357
0:14:38,51 --> 0:14:40,32
be with your friends.


358
0:14:40,32 --> 0:14:44,65
And that atmosphere, it was
obviously a lot funner.


359
0:14:44,65 --> 0:14:46,82
There's always pressure to try
to get footage and stuff.


360
0:14:46,82 --> 0:14:48,14
But it's a different
kind of pressure.


361
0:14:48,14 --> 0:14:50,58
It's more enjoyable.


362
0:14:50,58 --> 0:14:54,26
I think Montana was one of my
funnest ones with Ranquet and


363
0:14:54,26 --> 0:14:57,23
Graham, and probably
Seoane too.


364
0:14:57,23 --> 0:14:58,55
Just the snow was so good.


365
0:14:58,55 --> 0:15:1,76
It snowed so much up there
in big sky Montana.


366
0:15:1,76 --> 0:15:2,85
That was a super fun trip.


367
0:15:2,85 --> 0:15:7,69
And I don't remember too
much of any of those.


368
0:15:7,69 --> 0:15:9,69
I don't remember any of
my own highlights


369
0:15:9,69 --> 0:15:11,73
in any of the movies.


370
0:15:11,73 --> 0:15:12,92
JASON BORGSTEDE: You know
you were watching


371
0:15:12,92 --> 0:15:14,9
people's whole season.


372
0:15:14,9 --> 0:15:16,68
They were hour, hour and a half
long movies, you know?


373
0:15:16,68 --> 0:15:18,85
What I remember more than
anything is getting a Santa


374
0:15:18,85 --> 0:15:21,2
Cruz towel, riding
down the hill.


375
0:15:21,2 --> 0:15:24,69
And in those days, you just
emulated in your head.


376
0:15:24,69 --> 0:15:27,25
You thought, OK, I'm basically
this guy this run.


377
0:15:27,25 --> 0:15:28,15
You know?


378
0:15:28,15 --> 0:15:31,58
And him and Noah and people like
that were those guys for


379
0:15:31,58 --> 0:15:32,86
me a lot of times.


380
0:15:32,86 --> 0:15:35,94
I remember, of course, his
broken leg in critical


381
0:15:35,94 --> 0:15:38,665
condition, and all that stuff.


382
0:15:38,665 --> 0:15:44,23
CHRIS ROACH: Yeah, we were at
Snowbird, and there's a blind


383
0:15:44,23 --> 0:15:44,99
little drop.


384
0:15:44,99 --> 0:15:48,47
And Tucker went off at first,
and I yelled at him, how fast?


385
0:15:48,47 --> 0:15:49,315
He goes, as fast as you want.


386
0:15:49,315 --> 0:15:50,52
And I was like, all
right, cool.


387
0:15:50,52 --> 0:15:53,9
Not that it's Tucker's fault
by any means, but we were


388
0:15:53,9 --> 0:15:57,28
setting up, and I just went off
it I guess too fast and


389
0:15:57,28 --> 0:16:0,75
jumped right into little trees
and hooked up into them, and


390
0:16:0,75 --> 0:16:3,99
just started rag dolling
had over and stopped.


391
0:16:3,99 --> 0:16:9,7
And my femur got wrapped around
a tree and broke and


392
0:16:9,7 --> 0:16:12,64
sat in the fucking snow for
probably an hour or whatever


393
0:16:12,64 --> 0:16:15,87
because we were out of bounds
and with my shirt up and snow


394
0:16:15,87 --> 0:16:20,42
down my back and got dragged
out of there and waited for


395
0:16:20,42 --> 0:16:22,21
the helicopter.


396
0:16:22,21 --> 0:16:24,82
As soon as the morphine kicked
in, I was all right.


397
0:16:24,82 --> 0:16:27,35
Took the helicopter ride into
the hospital, and that


398
0:16:27,35 --> 0:16:30,2
hospital treated me really well
for a few weeks until I


399
0:16:30,2 --> 0:16:32,44
flew home and got healed up.


400
0:16:32,44 --> 0:16:35,97
Two and a half months into it,
I went to Chile with Dave


401
0:16:35,97 --> 0:16:39,41
Seoane just to see-- and Noah
Salasnek-- to see how my knee


402
0:16:39,41 --> 0:16:41,5
was, or my femur.


403
0:16:41,5 --> 0:16:43,75
And the only thing that hurt
was my knee where they tied


404
0:16:43,75 --> 0:16:44,92
that rod to my knee.


405
0:16:44,92 --> 0:16:47,6
And I was stoked to be back on
the snow two and a half months


406
0:16:47,6 --> 0:16:48,1
after that.


407
0:16:48,1 --> 0:16:48,65
-What's up, dude?


408
0:16:48,65 --> 0:16:49,45
We're in Chile.


409
0:16:49,45 --> 0:16:50,89
We're having fun.


410
0:16:50,89 --> 0:16:51,37
[INAUDIBLE].


411
0:16:51,37 --> 0:16:55,21
A lot of nice girls come from
different countries.


412
0:16:55,21 --> 0:16:55,69
-OK, OK.


413
0:16:55,69 --> 0:16:56,17
Stop.


414
0:16:56,17 --> 0:16:56,66
Stop.


415
0:16:56,66 --> 0:16:58,6
CHRIS ROACH: Portillo's
in Chile.


416
0:16:58,6 --> 0:17:2,6
And yeah, I went there with I
think the same guys, Noah and


417
0:17:2,6 --> 0:17:5,63
Dave Seoane and Shawn Farmer.


418
0:17:5,63 --> 0:17:8,49
That was just the
funnest trip.


419
0:17:8,49 --> 0:17:10,49
You go up there in the summer,
it's like Tahoe weather.


420
0:17:10,49 --> 0:17:13,569
It snowed for probably three
days, and was probably 60


421
0:17:13,569 --> 0:17:15,56
degrees during the day.


422
0:17:15,56 --> 0:17:20,79
And then it's like a little
resort for maybe the Brazilian


423
0:17:20,79 --> 0:17:23,47
people who come down or whoever
comes down and spends


424
0:17:23,47 --> 0:17:26,1
their summertimes or whatever.


425
0:17:26,1 --> 0:17:27,56
So it's a night life
thing too.


426
0:17:27,56 --> 0:17:30,53
You don't have to leave
the mountain.


427
0:17:30,53 --> 0:17:33,14
Everything's right there
at the resort.


428
0:17:33,14 --> 0:17:34,404
-The strobe lights are going.


429
0:17:34,404 --> 0:17:36,99
So they can't really
see my moves.


430
0:17:36,99 --> 0:17:37,76
CHRIS ROACH: I don't
know, man.


431
0:17:37,76 --> 0:17:42,27
I found one little
troll thing.


432
0:17:42,27 --> 0:17:45,84
And I think Noah had some
fun with maybe one other


433
0:17:45,84 --> 0:17:48,5
one, and you know.


434
0:17:48,5 --> 0:17:50,81
The girls, we couldn't
speak their language.


435
0:17:50,81 --> 0:17:51,94
They couldn't speak ours.


436
0:17:51,94 --> 0:17:52,97
So it was kind of one
of those fun things.


437
0:17:52,97 --> 0:17:56,35
You know, you just
mess around.


438
0:17:56,35 --> 0:17:58,326
-That's right, that's right.


439
0:17:58,326 --> 0:17:59,314
Come one.


440
0:17:59,314 --> 0:18:1,784
-I hate you.


441
0:18:1,784 --> 0:18:4,254
-She hates me.


442
0:18:4,254 --> 0:18:6,755
-But I love him.


443
0:18:6,755 --> 0:18:9,13
CHRIS ROACH: I think we were
in Colorado, one of those


444
0:18:9,13 --> 0:18:12,94
mountains, just because
Colorado, they think they have


445
0:18:12,94 --> 0:18:14,96
the best mountains, but
there's nothing there.


446
0:18:14,96 --> 0:18:17,7
It's just all fucking
ski slopes.


447
0:18:17,7 --> 0:18:18,84
So you stay in bounds.


448
0:18:18,84 --> 0:18:22,12
And there's nothing else
to do there besides do


449
0:18:22,12 --> 0:18:23,28
blood slides and shit.


450
0:18:23,28 --> 0:18:27,88
So we did those for a week and
learned how to press the board


451
0:18:27,88 --> 0:18:30,38
up shitty hill and trying to
progress snowboarding.


452
0:18:30,38 --> 0:18:32,82
What can we have fun
doing, you know?


453
0:18:32,82 --> 0:18:36,62
Nothing to jump and
nothing to do.


454
0:18:36,62 --> 0:18:37,49
I don't know, man.


455
0:18:37,49 --> 0:18:37,98
I don't know.


456
0:18:37,98 --> 0:18:38,59
I don't like the--


457
0:18:38,59 --> 0:18:39,93
I don't know.


458
0:18:39,93 --> 0:18:43,4
Whatever, you know how it is.


459
0:18:43,4 --> 0:18:47,63
Just, I guess, having fun
and riding sideways.


460
0:18:47,63 --> 0:18:48,29
I don't know.


461
0:18:48,29 --> 0:18:50,83
I didn't do anything for anybody
that I didn't give it.


462
0:18:50,83 --> 0:18:51,43
I don't know.


463
0:18:51,43 --> 0:18:55,73
If I did something for younger
kids, and I like to give my


464
0:18:55,73 --> 0:18:59,31
boards away as well at contests,
and that was it.


465
0:18:59,31 --> 0:19:4,19
I didn't try to snowboard for
anybody or any other reasons


466
0:19:4,19 --> 0:19:4,89
than for me.


467
0:19:4,89 --> 0:19:9,82
And if I help people enjoy it
more, then that's cool.


468
0:19:9,82 --> 0:19:12,61
But nothing more than that.


469
0:19:12,61 --> 0:19:14,15
I wouldn't change anything
I ever did.


470
0:19:14,15 --> 0:19:17,28
I mean, shit, I went through my
snowboarding career pretty


471
0:19:17,28 --> 0:19:19,655
much just partying
and having fun.


472
0:19:19,655 --> 0:19:22,29
I mean, snowboarding was on the
back burner almost to me.


473
0:19:22,29 --> 0:19:25,2
And that's unfortunate, but
that's the way it was.


474
0:19:25,2 --> 0:19:27,95
You know, you do what you can,
but you know what I mean.


475
0:19:27,95 --> 0:19:30,75
And you would do shit a little
smarter, maybe put a little


476
0:19:30,75 --> 0:19:33,1
bit more money in the
bank and shit.


477
0:19:33,1 --> 0:19:34,48
But you know, I mean,
what do you do?


478
0:19:34,48 --> 0:19:37,6
You know, you're out getting
paid to travel the world and


479
0:19:37,6 --> 0:19:38,59
ride ski lifts.


480
0:19:38,59 --> 0:19:40,61
I mean, that's incredible.


481
0:19:40,61 --> 0:19:42,26
I mean, who doesn't dream
about that kind


482
0:19:42,26 --> 0:19:42,57
of shit, you know?


483
0:19:42,57 --> 0:19:43,82
That's insane.


484
0:19:43,82 --> 0:21:43,82
