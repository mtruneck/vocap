###17 WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: CNN projects that Barack Obama will be re- elected president
###21 of the United States. He will remain in the White House for another four years.

###25 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Month of campaigning, primaries, caucuses, rallies, debates, all
###30 leading up to that moment -- the announcement of a victory and a second term in office for
###35 President Obama. It takes at least 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.
###42 In Tuesday`s elections, CNN projected that President Obama won more than 300. In the
###47 race for the White House, Republican and Democratic candidates clashed over their differences,
###51 but as that race came to a close, the president talked about the things that Americans have
###56 in common. And he talked about what lies ahead for the nation.

###59 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: It doesn`t matter whether you
###60 are black, or white, or Hispanic, or Asian or Native American, or young or old, or rich,
###60 or poor, able, disabled, gay or straight. You can make it here in America if you`re
###60 willing to try.
###60 (APPLAUSE)
###60 OBAMA: I believe we can seize this future together, because we are not as divided as
###60 our politics suggest. We are not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than
###62 the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states
###69 and blue states. We are and forever will be the United States of America, and together
###70 with your help and God`s grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just
###75 why is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth. Thank you, America.
###102 God bless you. God bless these United States.

###122 AZUZ: For former Governor Romney Tuesday`s election marked the end of a journey that
###127 started nearly a year and a half ago. He won the Republican Party`s presidential nomination,
###132 but he wasn`t able to rally enough support to win the White House. Last night he congratulated
###137 his opponent, he thanked his supporters and he talked about his hopes for the country`s
###141 future.
###141 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###142 MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This election is over, but our principles
###145 endure, I believe that the principles upon which this nation was founded are the only
###151 sure guide to a resurgent economy and to renewed greatness. Like so many of you, Paul and I
###158 have left everything on the field. We have given our all to this campaign.
###166 (APPLAUSE)
###168 ROMNEY: I so wish, I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country
###175 in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader and so Ann and I join with
###180 you to earnestly pray for him and for this great nation. Thank you and God bless America.
###186 You guys are the best. Thank you so much.
###189 RONALD REAGAN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, NOVEMBER 4, 1980: I`m not frightened
###195 by what lies ahead and I don`t believe the American people are frightened by what lies
###201 ahead.
###201 (APPLAUSE)
###201 GEORGE H.W. BUSH, NOVEMBER 4, 1988: I want to work for the hopes and interests, not only
###206 of my supporters, but of the governors and of those who didn`t vote at all. To those
###211 who supported me I will try to be worthy of your trust and to those who did not, I will
###218 try to earn it.
###219 BILL CLINTON, NOVEMBER 4, 1992. On this day, with high hopes and brave hearts and massive
###227 numbers the American people have voted to make a new beginning.
###232 GEORGE W. BUSH, DECEMBER 13, 2000: The presidency is more than an honor, it is more than an
###237 office, it is a charge to keep and I will give it my all.
###242 BARACK OBAMA, NOVEMBER 4, 2008: Because of what we did on this day, in this election,
###247 at this defining moment, change has come to America.
###252 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###256 AZUZ: Some big moments for those men who were all on their way to be presidents of the United
###261 States. But how much do you know about the position itself? Here is a little quiz we
###265 have for you. You may know that you have to be at least 35 years old, and you have to
###269 have been born in the U.S., but you also have to have lived in the U.S. for at least how
###274 many years?
###278 The answer is 14. Next up, who was the longest serving U.S. president? Franklin D. Roosevelt
###287 was elected to four terms, and that record appears safe, because there`s a current limit
###291 of two terms. That song you hear played for president at official events, what`s the name
###301 of that? It`s titled "Hail to the Chief." What about the oldest elected U.S. president?
###312 Ronald Reagan was 69 when he became president. And the youngest elected? John F. Kennedy
###320 was elected at the age of 43. And finally, what is the U.S. president`s salary? $400,000
###329 a year.
###330 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s time for "The Shoutout." Which of these U.S. political positions serves
###338 a two year term? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it president, senator, representative
###345 or vice president? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###352 U.S. representatives serve two year terms, the shortest of these options. That`s your
###358 answer and that`s your "Shoutout."
###362 AZUZ: That means the entire U.S. House of Representatives, all 435 voting seats were
###370 up for election yesterday, before yesterday`s vote, Republicans had control with 240 seats,
###377 Democrats had 190 seats, and five seats were vacant. Last night, CNN projected that Republicans
###383 would keep control of the House. When we produced this show, Republicans had won an estimated
###388 221 seats, Democrats had won 163 seats, and 51 seats were still undecided. As a balance
###396 of power was closer in the U.S. Senate and it was going to stay that way. Senators serve
###401 six-year terms, so only a third of the Senate, about 33 seats, were up for a vote on Tuesday.
###408 Going into that vote, there were 51 Democrats and 47 Republicans in the chamber, plus two
###413 independents who usually vote with the Democrats. When we produced this show, CNN predicted
###419 that Democrats would retain control with 51 seats, and Republicans would have 44 seats.
###426 Independents would have 2. Three seats were still undecided.
###428 Now, to get the latest numbers in the House of Senate races, go to cnnstudentnews.com.
###433 We`ll talk about the White House and both houses of Congress. Voters also cast their
###438 ballots on all sorts of state and local races yesterday. We are going to focus on that top
###443 spot in state government, the governor. 11 were voted on yesterday. Let`s start with
###449 these six states. Vermont, Delaware, West Virginia, Missouri, North Dakota and Utah.
###455 In these states, the incumbent, the current governor was running for reelection, and in
###460 all of them, the incumbent won. The five other states that had gubernatorial elections yesterday
###465 were definitely going to get a new governor. The races in Washington and Montana hadn`t
###469 been polled when we recorded this program, but in New Hampshire and Indiana, the new
###473 governor will be from the same party as the current governor. North Carolina is the only
###478 state where we know there will be a different party in the governor`s mansion. So what it`s
###483 like to actually get out and vote in the presidential election? Especially for the first time? And
###487 I-Reporter in Georgia cast her first ballot yesterday. She talked to us about why she
###492 thought it was both cool and important for her to vote.
###496 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###502 SHELBY NORMAN, FIRST TIME VOTER, AGE 18: Hi, I`m Shelby Norman, and I`m in Saville (ph),
###526 Georgia waiting to go inside to start my first voting experience. I`ve been preparing for
###526 a little while, now I`ve been reading news editorials and learning a little bit about
###526 each candidate and everything that I will be voting for.
###526 So, I`m inside now, I`m getting ready to vote. They`ve got my photo I.D. ready to go. And
###527 right now I`m feeling pretty anxious and pretty excited. Being a first time voter is a really
###527 crazy experience, and it`s something that I really looked forward to for a while now.
###531 And so, I`m just really excited to go in there and stand in line with my parents and we`re
###538 just going to stand and wait. I`m not really sure how long it will take, but the line seems
###544 pretty short, and we can actually wait inside, which is really nice, because it`s really
###550 cold outside. So it`s time to go.
###555 So I just came out of my polling place and I have finished voting for the first time,
###564 and I got my commemorate "I`m a Georgia Voter" sticker.
###566 The whole process took around 45 minutes.
###567 It`s very important for you to do your research. Because you are not just voting for who you
###571 think is going to be president, but also your state representatives. It`s very important
###575 that you go out and exercise your right to vote, because not everyone gets that choice.
###579 And it`s really important because your voice does get heard whether you think it does or
###583 not.
###584 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###584 AZUZ: All right, before we go, here is a look at what it was like to be here at CNN on election
###590 night.

###639 we show you are edited. In fact, you could see CNN STUDENT NEWS being put together as
###644 I speak.

###656 your support.
