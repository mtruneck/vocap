###313 UNFOLDING EVENTS IN BOSTON TODAY. JOINING ME WITH SOME LOCAL REACTION IS KPBS
###318 INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AMITA SHARMA. AMITA, YOU WERE OUT AND ABOUT.
###327 >> >>AMITA: WE ENGAGED IN A LITTLE BIT OF SOUL SEARCHING HOW TO LOCALIZE THIS STORY
###335 TO SAN DIEGO. THERE AREN'T A LOT OF CHECHEN PEOPLE WHO LIVE
###340 HERE. I MEAN, THERE'S SOME CHECHEN CAB DRIVERS,
###342 BUT NO ORGANIZED CHECHEN COMMUNITY WHO CARED TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS.
###347 THEN NEWS STARTED TRICKLING OUT ABOUT THE STATE OF THESE TWO SUSPECTS, THE TWO BROTHERS.
###354 IT IS ISLAM. ONE OF THE BROTHERS, THE YOUNGER BROTHER I
###357 BELIEVE HAD WRITTEN ON FACEBOOK THAT HIS WORLD VIEW IS ISLAM.
###360 THE OLDER BROTHER CONSIDERS HIMSELF AT LEAST ON FACEBOOK @ AS A DEVOUT MUSLIM.
###366 SO WE WENT TO GO TALK TO THE CLAIREMONT MOSQUE. HE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS MET WITH COMMUNITY
###374 GROUPS OVER THE YEARS QUITE FREQUENTLY TO TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THESE
###381 TERRORIST ACTS WHEN THEY ARE COMMITTED BY ISLAMIC RADICALS SOAVMENT, YOU SO, YOU KNOW,
###386 WE WANTED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS RKS TO THE EVENTS THIS WEEK AS THEY UNFOAD LD.
###391 HE SAID BASICALLY HE HAD REACTED TO THE BOMBINGS IN BOSTON ON MONDAY AS ANY PERSON WOULD.
###397 HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. >> >>: WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE NEWS CLOSELY.
###404 AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF PEOPLE AND PROPERTIES IN THE BOSTON AREA.
###411 AND AS ANY FAITH BASED COMMUNITY AND ETHNIC GROUP, WE FELT VERY SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED
###421 TO THE INNOCENT PEOPLE. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A CRIME.
###426 AND REGARDLESS WHO IS BEHIND IT. >> >>PEGGY: THAT WAS SORT OF GENERAL TAKE
###430 ON IT. WHEN YOU TOLD HIMﾊ WHEN HE LEARNED THE TWO
###433 SUSPECTS IN THE BOMBING WERE CHECH EXPN MUSLIM, WHAT WAS HIS REACTION TO THAT?
###438 >> >>AMITA: HE SAID THE IRONY WAS HIS REACTION DIDN'T CHANGE.
###441 HE'S WELL AWARE THAT THE PUBLIC'S REACTION MOA MORE THAN LIKELY HAS CHANGED.
###447 IN OTHER WORDS RS ONCE THE PUBLIC LEARNED THAT THESE TWO SUSPECTS WERE CHECHEN, THAT
###453 THEY WERE MUSLIM, THEIR ETHNICITY, THEIR FAITH, HE'Sﾊ HE BELIEVES THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL
###460 USE THIS JUST TO REINFORCE THE BELIEF THAT ISLAM SOME HOW MOTIVATES TERRORISM.
###467 >> >>PEGGY: A FALSE BELIEF, NECESSARILY. >> >>AMITA: THAT'S A DEBATE FOR ANOTHER TIME,
###475 ANOTHER SHOW. I ASKED HIM IF HE WAS TIRED OF BEING APPROACHED
###479 BY JOURNALISTS TO TALK ABOUT TERRORISM WHENEVER THERE IS AN ACT COMMITTED BY AN ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST
###487 ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, AND HIS RESPONSE WAS MIXED.
###491 >> >>: YES, AND NO. YES, BECAUSE YOU KNOW I EXPECTED THIS AND
###496 NO BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT MY JOB AS AN IMAM OF THIS COMMUNITY IS TO NULLIFY THESE KINDS
###502 OF CONCEPTIONS. THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO TELL
###505 EVERYONE THAT ISLAM HAS NOTHING TO GOO WITH SUCH CRIMES.
###509 THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PRESENTED THEMSELVES THEY SHOULD BE DEALT WITH AS CRIMINALLED.
###515 >> >>PEGGY: SAN DIEGO HAS NOTORIOUS LINKS TO HIGH PROFILE HAIR RS ACTS AND CRIMINALS
###521 OVER THE DECADE. >> >>AMITA: THAT'S RIGHT, PEGGY.
###525 ACTUALLY TWO OF THE IS SEPTEMBERﾊ11 HIGH JACKERS LIVED HERE, STUDIED HERE, WORSHIPED
###533 HERE BEFORE THEY FLEW A PLANE INTO THE PENTAGON ON SEPTEMBERﾊ11.
###538 THEY ALSO MET PLIEIVE PRIVATELY QUITE FREQUENTLY WITH AN IMAM AT A MOSQUE IN LA MESA.
###545 THIS IMAM IS NONE OTHER THAN WHO WAS CONSIDERED A LEADER OF AL QAEDA ON THE ARAB PENINSULA.
###553 HE WAS FASCINATED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN SEPTEMBERﾊ2011.
###560 THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER TERRORIST GROUP BY THE NAME OF ALSHABOB IN SMALL YOU.
###565 ONE OF THE TOP COMMANDERS IN THAT GROUP IS A LOCAL SAN DIEGAN.
###571 HE STUDIED HERE, WENT THERE I BELIEVE IN 2005, THAT'S WHAT FEDERAL OFFICIALS BELIEVE.
###577 AND THEN JUST AS RECENTLY AS FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR, A JURY IN SAN DIEGO CONVICTED FOUR MEN
###585 INCLUDING AN IMAM AT A LOCAL P MOSQUE IN CITY HEIGHTS OF SENDING MONEY, CONSPIRING TO SEND
###591 MONEY AND PROVIDE OTHER MATERIAL SUPPORT TO AL SHABOB IN SO SOMALIA.

###597 CAST A SHADOW ON THE START OF DEBATE ON A SWEEPING NEW IMMIGRATION BILL TODAY.
###602 A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS USED THE EVENTS IN BOSTON TO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EXISTING
###604 IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN THE NEW BILL.
###604 THE ATTACKS WERE ALLEGEDLY CARRIED OUT BY TWO BROTHERS OF A RUSSIAN REGION OF CHEF NU
###605 CHECHNYA. WHEN THOUSANDS OF POLICE CONVERSED ON BOSTON
###606 TODAY T CAUSED THE CITY TO COME TO A COMPLETE HALT.
###606 ON L PLAIJER BUS LINES WERE SUSPENDED ALONG WITH AMTRAK SERVICE BETWEEN BAWS EXPN NEW

###625 HE'S THE ONE THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR NOW. HIS PHOTO APPEARS TO CAPTURE ONE OF THE SUSPECTS
###629 ACTUALLY FLEEING WITH OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT AFTER THE EXPLOSIONS.
###632 HE'S SEEN IN THE WHITE BASEBALL CAP AMAN WHO TOOK THE PHOTO WAS LEAVING THE STORE WHEN
###636 THE BOMBS EXPLODED. HOO GOT A QUICK PHOTO WITH THE IPHONE BUT
###637 DIDN'T NOTICE WHO IT WAS UNTIL YESER DAW. SOCIAL MEDIA PROVED TO BE A POWERFUL TOOL
###641 FOR INVESTIGATORS HUNTING THE BOSTON BAWM NING SUSPECTS.
###643 PEGGY PICO HAS MORE ON SAN DIEGO'S CONNECTION TO THE HIGH TECH INVESTIGATION.
###647 >> >>PEGGY: HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PHOTOS AND TWEETS FROM MARATHON SPECTATORS HELP UNDER
###651 VEST GATERS ZERO IN ON THE SUSPECT SAID. KPBS REPORTER SUSAN MURPHY JOINS ME WITH HOW
###657 SAN DIEGO STATE'S VIZ CENTER AND HOMELAND SECURITY SPHOONTS GOT INVOLVED.
###662 YOU'VE TALKED EXTENSIVELY THIS WEEK WITH ERIC FROST AT THE VIZ CENTER.
###667 >> >>SUSAN: ERIC FROST IS CODIRECTOR OF SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY'S HOMELAND SECURITY
###673 PROGRAM, AND DIRECTOR O F THE VIZ CENTER. HE GATHER MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA FROM PHOTOS
###680 AND TWITTER, AND CREATES THESE VISUALIZATIONS, IT'S TIEBL CAPTURE A SCENE SECOND BY SECOND,
###687 AND HE SAYS PEOPLE AT MONDAY'S MARATHON, THEY ANALYZED THIS DATA AT LIGHTNING SPEED.
###694 HERE'S WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT. >> >>: THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS EFFORT QUIETLY
###698 IN THE BACK END TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE AND TAKE THEM OFF THE SUSPECT LIST.
###706 SO THAT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE OR WHEN THE FBI RELEASED THEM, IT WASN'T WE
###710 THINK THESE ARE, IT WAS LIKE THESE ARE THE GUYS IT.
###715 AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF WORK IN THE BACKGROUND.
###718 >> >>PEGGY: NOW, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT GETTING ALL OF THIS AND GETTING THIS INFORMATION,
###723 IS THAT WHAT WE REFER TO AS CROWD SOURCING? >> >>SUSAN: CROWD SOURCING USED TO BE TIP
###728 LINES, THESE TELEVISION SHOWS THAT ASKED THE PUBLIC TO SOLVE INVESTIGATIONS.
###734 SOCIAL MEDIA TAKES IT TO A NEW LEVEL. ERIC FROST EXPLAINS.
###740 >> >>: HERE'S THIS MASS AMOUNT OF DATA COMES IN, IT'S IN AN ORGANIZED WAY, AND IT'S ORGANIZED
###745 AND YOU CAN DO SOMETHING WITH IT. AND SO A COMMON THOUGHT PATTERN IS IF YOU'RE
###751 CROWD SOURCING, SO LIKE IN A DISASTER, HAVE OTHER PEOPLE TELL YOU WHAT'SER GOING O, YOU
###755 THEN KNOW WHAT'SER GOING ON, AND WHAT USUALLY WORKS THE BEST IS SAY TO THE CROWD GIVING
###760 SOMETHING BACK THAT'S CALLED CROWD FEEDING. >> >>PEGGY: HE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS CROWD
###765 FEEDING, THIS CROWD SOURCING, THIS BACK AND FORTH CONVERSATION THAT'S NOT JUST SENDING
###769 IN A PICTURE. BUT THERE'S SOME DRAW BACKS TO THAT SORT OF
###772 TWO WAY CONVERSATION. >> >>SUSAN: YEAH, RUMORS CAN START.
###775 THERE WERE ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN PEOPLE WHO WERE WRONGLY LABELED AS SUSPICIOUS.
###780 RUMORS CAN FLY RAPIDLY ON TWITTER. WELL, MOST OF THEM WERE PHOTOS OF MEN WITH
###786 BACKPACKS OF COURSE, ANDﾊ >> >>PEGGY: THEY WERE ACTUALLY THESE MEN WERE
###791 ACTUALLY PEOPLE WERE SENDING IN SAYING THESE MIGHT TBHEE GUY, RIGHT?
###794 >> >>SUSAN: RIGHT SOME OF THEM WERE POSTED ON MEDIA OUTLETS.
###798 THE POSITIVE THING IS THAT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO COME FORWARD AND CLEAR THEMSELVES
###802 WITH POLICE. IT ALSO HELP UNDER VEST GATERS TO NARROW DOWN
###806 THE SUSPECT LIST. >> >>PEGGY: ABSOLUTELY.
###808 SO IT CAN WORK BOTH WAYS. IT CAN BE HARMFUL IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE RUMOR
###811 GUYS. NOW THE BOSTON MARATHON, LIKE THE SAN DIEGO
###815 MARATHON OR ANY REALLY PUBLIC SPORTING EVENT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR QUITE AWHILE HAS AS A SOFT
###822 TARGET. WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO FROST, HE WAS ESPECIALLY
###825 CONCERNED ABOUT THIS, HOW COME? >> >>SUSAN: HE FEARS THAT WE'VE ENTER UNDER
###831 TO A NEW ERA OF TERRORISM. >> >>: PEOPLE GETTING IN OVER AND OVER.
###836 PEOPLE SEE THAT WORKED REALLY WELL, IT WAS ON CAMERA, ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT
###840 IT AND THIS HAD THE RIGHT EFFECT, SO I'M GOING TO DO THE SAME THING.
###845 IT'S LIKE WHEN THE FIRST PEOPLE HIGH JACKED AN AIRPLANE, OUR WORLD CHANGED AND FOR SPORTS
###851 EVENTS ABSOLUTELY SPORTS EVENTS ARE AN EXTRAORDINARY TARGET.
###855 THE TEAMS ARE A TARGET BECAUSE THAT'S THE MAJOR ASSET THAT THE TEAM HAS, AND HOW YOU
###861 PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE. >> >>PEGGY: THESE SOFT TARGETS HE'S TALKING
###864 ABOUT HAVE BEEN KNOWN FOR SOME TIME, AND THERE WERE GRAD STUDENTS YOU TALKED WITH AT THE
###867 VIZ CENTERS THAT ARE STUDYING SPORTS SECURITY SPECIFICALLY.
###871 WHAT DID THEY HAVE TO SAY ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED FROM THIS BOSTON MARATHON SITUATION?
###876 >> >>SUSAN: THEY'VE LEARN AD LOT. THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOING BACK AND DISUDYING,
###879 THEY'RE CONTINUING THE INVESTIGATION, COMPILING EVIDENCE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, AND PHOTOS.
###885 THEY SAY THAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS THE BEST KIND OF FORENSIC EVIDENCE BECAUSE EVERY PHOTO AND
###890 SOCIAL MEDIA ENTRY HAS A TIME STAMP AND A LOCATE LOCATION AND THAT DATA IS INVALUABLE.
###896 >> >>PEGGY: YOU CAN SEE SUSAN MURPHY'S COMPLETE REPORT ON OUR WEBSITE KPBS.ORG.

###988 THE SAN ONOFRE NUCLEAR PLANT STILL BE COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY? KPBS
###994 NORTH COUNTY BUREAU CHIEF ALISON ST. JOHN SAYS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PLANT'S FUTURE ARE
###998 MORE COMPLEX. >> >>ALISON: BILL HENMAN IS A NUCLEAR ENGINEER
###1003 AND CONSULTANT. HE'S ASSESSED RISK AT NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS
###1006 AROUND THE COUNTRY. I ASKED HIM IF IT WOULD BE COST EFFECTIVE
###1009 TO BRING SAN ONOFRE BACK ONLINE. >> >>: I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES.
###1015 IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY, THE PLANT HAS DONE VERY WELL RK IT'S OPERATED ESSENTIALLY
###1019 30 YEARS WITH NO REAL PROBLEMS LIKE THE BUN THAT WE HAVE NOW.
###1025 AND IT'S BEEN A REAL FRIEND TO PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT'S KEPT OUR RATES LOW,
###1031 BELIEVE IT OR NOT. >> >>ALISON: HE SAYS IT WOULD BE WORTH SPENDING
###1035 MONEY TO BRING IT BACK ONLINE BECAUSE MOST OF THE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT COSTS ARE PAID OFF.
###1041 >> >>: THE ADDITION OF NEW STEAM GENERATORS, EVEN IF WE HAVE OO REPLACE THE ONES IN UNIT
###1046 THREE WOULDN'T BEﾊ I DON'T THINK IS THAT BAD BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY 700ﾊMILLION,
###1054 LET'S SAY. WHEN YOU HAVE A MILLION OR MORE CUSTOMERS
###1059 THAT ARE PAYING IN THAT AMOUNT CAN GET PAID OFF RATHER QUICKLY.
###1064 WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE IT POWER TO COVER THOSE COSTS.
###1069 >> >>ALISON: WE'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON THE FAILED STEAM GENERATORS AT SAN ONOFRE, BUT
###1074 THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WILL COST MONEY, PERHAPS A LOT OF MONEY, TO ADDRESS IN THE
###1079 NOT SO DISTANT FUTURE. >> >>: DO WE WANT TO GIVE THEM ANOTHER BILLION
###1082 DOLLARS AND ANOTHER FIVE YEARS TO MAYBE OPERATE FOR ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS WHEN OTHER COSTS ARE
###1089 ON THE HORIZON. >> >>ALISON: SHE SAYS CALIFORNIA RATE PAYERS
###1092 NEED TO KNOW WHAT OTHER COSTS ARE AHEAD LIKE COSTS TRIGGERED BY WHAT HAPPENED.
###1098 >> >>: IF YOU DRIVE INTO THIS LOVELY CAMP GROUND, YOU NOTICE A SIGN THAT SAYS TSUNAMI
###1102 ZONE, THERE ARE SIRENS FOR EMERGENCY PLANNING, THE TRANSMISSION LINES AND ARE THEY SAFE DURING
###1110 A SEISMIC EVENT. >> >>ALISON: STUDIES OF EARTHQUAKE FAULT LINES
###1112 ON THE COAST COULD REVEAL MAJOR RETRO FITS ARE NEEDED AT SAN ONOFRE.
###1118 BECKER SAYS ANOTHER COST IS WHERE TO STORE NUCLEAR WASTE.
###1123 >> >>: THOUSANDS OF TONS OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE SIT BEHIND ME ON OUR COAST.
###1130 THE NRC HAS NO PLANS TO GELT IT OFF OUR COAST, AND WE'VE BEEN PROMISED SINCE 1982 THAT IT
###1135 WOULD BE REMOVED TO SOMEWHERE ELSE, SOME DAY. >> >>ALISON: A THIRD UNRESOLVED ISSUE IS WHAT
###1141 IT WILL COST TO REDESIGN THE PLANT'S COOLING SYSTEM, PERHAPS WITH COOLING TOWERS TO MEET
###1145 NEW CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS TO PROTECT MARINE LIFE.
###1148 >> >>: A MILLION GALLONS A MINUTE GOES THROUGH THIS PLANT, SUCKING IN SEA LIFE, LARVAE, TAKING
###1153 OUT WARMER WATER. THE ALTERNATIVES ARE REALLY VERY EXPENSE F,
###1160 TECHNICALLY VERY CHALLENGING, AND COULD RESHAPE THIS COAST LINE AGAIN.
###1166 THEY'RE GOING TO ASK RATE PAYERS TO PAY, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST BEFORE
###1170 THEY ASK ME TO PAY. THIS PLANT BEHIND ME WAS DESIGNED IN 1967.
###1175 MAYBE POURING A LOT OF MONEY INTO A NEW PLANT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE, NEW EMERGENCY PLANNING,
###1181 NEW STEAM GENERATORS, NEW SEISMIC STUDIES, BUT DOING THAT FOR A PLANT THAT WAS DESIGNED
###1190 IN THE 1960S HOW MANY OF US ARE GOING TO DRIVE A CAR, FIX EVERYTHING UP, AND SAY WE'RE GOING
###1196 TO DRIVE IT ANOTHER 20 YEARS. >> >>ALISON: BILL DOESN'T BUY THE OLD CAR

###1217 MILE RADIUS RIGHT HERE. WE'RE SITTING IN THE RANGE OF SOMETHING FROM
###1222 THE PLANT RIGHT NOW. I'M TOTALLY COMFORTABLE.
###1225 FOR ME, THE TRADE OFF IN HAVING A SOLID, GOOD ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IS FAR BETTER THAN, YOU
###1235 KNOW, WORRYING ABOUT A SMALL RISK THAT WE HAVEN'T EVER ENCOUNTERED BEFORE.

###1248 BELIEVES TAX PAYERS LIABILITY IS UNDER ESTIMATED. >> >>: THE FEDERAL LIABILITY LIMIT IS $12.6ﾊBILLIONS.

###1266 THIS IS THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. >> >>ALISON: BECKER SAYS THE UTILITIES ARE
###1269 NOT IGNORING ALL THESE ISSUES, BUT THE RATE PAYER NEEDS TO KNOW HOW THESE PROBLEMS WILL
###1273 BE RESOLVED AND WHAT THAT WILL COST. >> >>: WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST
###1278 NUCLEAR POWER, THE ARGUMENTS FOR NUCLEAR POWER. THESE ARE A SIDE ISSUE.
###1283 WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT IS NUCLEAR POWER GOING TO COST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,
###1288 COST THE RATE PAYERS OF CALIFORNIA, IF OUR LIVES AND OUR LIVELIHOODS ARE AT STAKE, AND
###1293 WE NEED THE ANSWERS. >> >>ALISON: SAN ONOFRE'S BEEN A SOURCE OF
