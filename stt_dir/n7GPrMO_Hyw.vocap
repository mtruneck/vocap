###7 ROBERTS: They say this is where it all began.
###14 That we are all children of Africa.
###20 But if so, why do we look so different?
###26 And how on earth could a handful of African families
###29 become a whole world full of people?
###45 I'm Alice Roberts, medical doctor and anthropologist.
###50 I'm fascinated by what bones, stones
###55 and even our bodies can reveal about the distant past.
###61 I'm going in search of the traces left by our African ancestors
###65 and their journeys to populate the world.
###70 This time, the most intriguing puzzle of all...
###73 That's beautiful.
###74 ...how on earth did people make the long
###76 and dangerous journey to Australia,
###82 before they even reached Europe?
###85 I'm really worried we're gonna get swept in by these breakers.
###88 Come with me in the footsteps of our ancestors
###91 on the most epic adventure ever undertaken.
###113 No one knows how humans first reached Australia.
###119 WOMAN ON RADIO: Forty-one degrees in Mildura today and 4 1 in Swan Hill.
###123 ROBERTS: So I'm starting where the journey could have ended,
###128 in a remote wilderness 800 kilometres from Sydney.
###140 This landscape is just so parched and barren-looking.
###145 And it's mid-morning, and it's already over 40 degrees out there.
###150 Baking.
###152 And as soon as you step outside the car, you get mobbed by hundreds of flies.
###156 Not very pleasant.
###160 It's hard to imagine
###162 why our ancestors would have wanted to make this their home.
###166 If that's really what happened.
###173 There's so little evidence.
###175 But just recently, something was found near here.
###186 one of the few people who knows its whereabouts is Warren Clark.
###192 -We'll just walk up the ridge a bit. -Up here?
###194 Yeah.
###199 ROBERTS: The discovery was made by a young Aboriginal Australian.
###218 ROBERTS: So major that as soon as it was revealed
###220 the site was buried again, to protect it.
###224 It's still secret today?
###240 ROBERTS: But I've come here on a special day.
###243 Because for the first time since the site was reburied,
###246 local Aboriginal people and archaeologists are gathering once more
###250 to check on their discovery.
###259 over 500 human footprints.
###263 ROBERTS: This is the heel here.
###266 And you can see the way that the foot sort of lifts up here,
###268 that's where the arch of the foot would be.
###270 And then the big toe is just there. So this is a right foot.
###275 It's amazing to see something which is so ephemeral,
###278 sort of normally here today, gone tomorrow.
###281 This is looking like a pretty big footprint.
###283 -Yeah, he's well fed. -(LAUGHING) Yeah.
###287 ROBERTS: It's incredibly hard, this layer, isn't it? Feels really stony.
###291 -Is it a type of clay? -MAN: It's just like our pottery.
###295 And it must feel pretty personal as well, 'cause, you know, this is...
###297 I mean, this is your own heritage, isn't it?
###299 One of the oldest cultures in the world.
###301 So it's very special and unique.
###311 ROBERTS: But who do the footprints belong to?
###316 Tanya Charles was here when they were found.
###320 TANYA: Other people that was with us, they were saying,
###323 ''They belong to the farmers that were here.''
###324 And we're like, ''No, they're ours.''
###328 (LAUGHS) You fellas wear shoes. We don't. We didn't back then.
###332 We just knew in our hearts, we knew that they were ours.
###337 ROBERTS: Scientists and Aboriginal trackers
###340 have interpreted the prints of men, women and children
###343 walking and running around the edges of what was once an ancient lake.
###348 The most bizarre track seems to have belonged to a one-legged man.
###353 Like, we sort of knew that he only had one foot,
###356 but we didn't want to believe it.
###357 ROBERTS: Yeah.
###358 'Cause, you know, one-footed men way back in them times is like, ''Oh, scary.''
###363 And he was chasing a kangaroo, and on his first throw
###367 he actually missed the kangaroo.
###368 ROBERTS: (LAUGHING) Right.
###370 Yeah. On his second throw, he got him and dropped him down to one knee.
###375 ROBERTS: How long ago did these people live?
###383 With a new technique called luminescence dating,
###387 scientists could measure the tiniest glow
###390 when grains of sand from the footprints were analysed.
###393 And from this, they could calculate how long the footprints had lain buried.
###399 The results were stunning.
###403 The footprints were around 20,000 years old.
###415 There's something really intimate about this,
###416 because it's just a moment in somebody's life,
###421 when they walked across this landscape.
###423 And it just looks like it could be a footprint made yesterday.
###427 And yet it's about 20,000 years old.
###435 So is this when people first reached Australia,
###439 long after we colonised Europe and Asia?
###443 It would certainly make sense, given how far away Australia is.
###453 But I've been told that there is other evidence around here
###457 that could turn this idea upside down.
###461 What I'm looking for are the remains of an extinct beast,
###465 the giant kangaroo.
###469 It's just about midday here and it's very hot.
###474 All right, what's that?
###479 That is a stick.
###481 I spotted that in the distance and thought,
###482 ''Oh, right, could that be a giant kangaroo?''
###485 It's not, it's a stick.
###489 Lots of little bits.
###491 So this thing I've picked up is
###492 one of the long foot bones of a modern kangaroo.
###507 Oh, look.
###511 Right, so we've got two bits to it.
###514 And if I put those together like that, that is the toe bone
###519 of an ancient giant kangaroo.
###523 Now, if we look at that end, you can see that
###526 basically it's the same bone as this one,
###528 but this one belongs to a much chunkier animal.
###531 They're actually similar length,
###532 if you imagine sort of the end on that as well.
###535 But you can just see how much chunkier that is.
###537 And you can imagine how much heavier that animal would have been.
###546 Giant kangaroos could grow up to 2.5 metres tall.
###558 But they seem to have become extinct
###561 shortly after 50,000 years ago.
###567 Could this possibly have been due to a new predator arriving on the scene?
###579 If so, it would mean that we humans
###581 arrived here much earlier than 20,000 years ago.
###586 And there is something - or rather someone -
###589 who could support such an early arrival.
###594 Mungo Man.
###602 This is the skull of Mungo Man.
###607 And these bones
###608 are the most ancient human remains that have ever been found in Australia.
###612 And they are incredibly old.
###615 The most conservative estimates put them at 40,000 years old,
###619 and some people say they might be up to 60,000 years old.
###624 Now, that's quite extraordinary,
###626 because it would mean that modern humans were in Australia
###631 before they reached Europe.
###636 Which seems highly unlikely.
###638 Not only is Australia so much further from Africa than Europe is,
###642 there's an ocean to cross.
###648 So unlikely does the journey seem
###651 that some scientists have poured doubt on it.
###658 Instead, they suggest that Australians somehow evolved locally.
###669 And it really is a mystery.
###673 The problem is that there is very little physical evidence
###677 to show that this route from Africa all the way to Australia
###681 was ever taken.
###683 It's one of the biggest puzzles of our human journey.
###687 There's only one way to solve this mystery,
###690 and that's to go back to the beginning of the trail.
###696 To Africa.
###699 Previously, I saw evidence suggesting that most of us descend
###703 from a tiny group of people who left the continent around 70,000 years ago.
###709 one theory is that those families crossed the Red Sea,
###713 and then pushed east, hugging the shoreline.
###718 Then they would have probably trekked along the Indian coast.
###729 So that's the first place to look for evidence
###733 of this journey towards Australia.
###736 (CHANTING IN LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###740 It would be absolutely fantastic to have a trail of stone tools and human fossils
###746 all the way along the coast of India.
###749 Sadly, there just isn't.
###752 Along thousands of miles of coastline, nothing.
###758 But maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.
###763 I've heard that some new evidence has been unearthed
###766 in a very remote part of India.
###768 (TYRE BLOWS)
###771 one which is proving tricky to get to.
###777 Might hitch a ride on one of these tuk-tuks instead.
###788 There is some real evidence turning up right now
###791 at an archaeological site a very long way from the coast.
###795 It's called Jwalapuram, and it's right in the heart of southern India.
###814 From here, it's a beautiful fertile valley,
###820 but just under the surface is a thick layer of white ash.
###829 Today, it is mined by poor families from the village of Jwalapuram,
###834 who sell the ash to chemical companies.
###837 But the ash itself has an incredible story to tell.
###842 (VOLCANO RUMBLING)
###847 It starts thousands of years ago, when Mount Toba on Sumatra erupted.
###859 A supervolcano.
###863 The most devastating eruption in human experience.
###870 The ash cloud was blown over 2,000 kilometres northwest,
###875 reaching as far as India.
###883 Just imagine what it would've been like,
###885 a lush landscape suddenly transformed.
###887 Clouds of ash in the air, choking plant and animal life.
###891 It would have been an environmental disaster.
###894 So what can Toba tell us?
###896 Well, we have a precise date. Toba erupted 74,000 years ago.
###902 The question for us is, had modern humans reached India
###906 by the time it happened?
###911 Until recently, the answer was no,
###915 but a new discovery could change that.
###918 Indian archaeologists have joined forces with Mike Petraglia
###922 from Cambridge University.
###928 -MIKE: It does look like a blade. -Yes, sir.
###930 But most importantly, there's retouch all along here.
###933 Yeah, retouch. Yes.
###934 And it looks like an end scraper.
###936 ROBERTS: And Mike is making some surprising claims
###939 from what they found deep in the ash.
###943 So this is the Toba super-eruption,
###945 the deposit that we have representing the ash fall.
###949 ROBERTS: That's a huge amount of ash.
###951 Yeah, it's about 2 metres' worth of ash.
###954 And the bottom part is what we call the primary ash.
###957 So this is still ash down here, this grey stuff.
###960 Yeah. You see there's very sharp contact.
###962 The beginning of the ash starts here and it goes up,
###967 all the way up to 2 metres.
###969 And what's so striking is that we have
###971 so many spectacular artefacts coming out.
###974 ROBERTS: That's like a little spearhead.
###976 MIKE: Yes, that's exactly what it is.
###977 We think it's actually the tip to a spear.
###981 -Yeah. -And what's so interesting
###982 about this particular piece is the tip is broken,
###985 and so we know the spear was launched and it broke in use.
###989 Now, what's important about this particular piece
###991 is it occurs in deposits below the ash at 78,000 years ago.
###996 So you know the date of it?
###997 We know very precisely the date of it.
###999 It's in between 78,000 and 74,000 years ago.
###1003 That's a very, very early date, Mike.
###1004 Yes, and the importance of that date
###1007 is that these spear points are also found in North Africa,
###1012 anywhere between 90 and 60,000 years ago.
###1015 So our point fits exactly with that age range.
###1021 ROBERTS: Mike believes this is good evidence that our ancestors were here.
###1025 (RUMBLING)
###1028 But could they have survived this,
###1031 a supervolcano?
###1035 Well, along with that one stone point
###1038 the team have found many other types of tool.
###1042 We have continuity of the tools, found both below the ash and above the ash.
###1048 So we have literally hundreds of artefacts that look rather similar.
###1051 Right. Does that mean that the human population that was here below the ash
###1057 survived the Toba super-eruption?
###1060 MIKE: Yes, that's our argument,
###1061 that whoever was here survived the Toba super-eruption.
###1064 Even though this was a major event,
###1067 it had an effect on those populations, but those populations survived
###1072 through the volcanic event.
###1077 ROBERTS: But were these tools really left by our species?
###1080 There are plenty of scientists who won't be persuaded
###1083 until the team find more evidence, such as human bones.
###1091 But I must say, I'm personally quite convinced by the evidence here.
###1095 So Jwalapuram at 78,000 years is my first milestone
###1101 on the route eastwards out of Africa.
###1104 So where did they go next?
###1111 At last, a hint that our early ancestors may have come this way.
###1116 Perhaps some of those families who survived Toba
###1120 began to slowly spread across the continent.
###1124 So it's not really a journey in the conventional sense,
###1128 because although I'm certainly covering a lot of ground here
###1132 trying to recapture the movements that these early humans
###1137 made across the landscape, really what we're talking about is
###1141 population expansion.
###1143 Pressure of numbers and competition for resources.
###1147 And the natural thing to do is
###1149 for people to spread out across the landscape.
###1152 And you can just imagine family groups sort of splitting off
###1155 and just moving away in all directions,
###1158 and the genetic tree gradually growing and spreading out as well.
###1168 But behind that wave of colonisation pushing eastwards,
###1172 some families would have stayed where they were
###1175 and put down roots.
###1179 And maybe it's the people that stayed put
###1182 who could provide the next clue.
###1186 The countries around the Indian ocean are dotted with remote tribes
###1191 who look very different to everyone else.
###1195 Could they shed any light on the first colonisers?
###1200 To investigate, I'm on my way to Malaysia.
###1211 What an amazing city.
###1215 The cosmopolitan capital, Kuala Lumpur.
###1234 But a few hours away there's a completely different world...
###1242 and a small group of people hanging on to a traditional life.
###1248 Could they be a relic of that first migration east from Africa?
###1255 The Semang tribes are believed to be the most ancient people in Malaysia.
###1263 And they do look different from other Malaysians.
###1274 Now, this is a selection of typical Malaysian faces.
###1278 And you can see these people are quite light-skinned,
###1282 quite East Asian-looking in their appearance.
###1286 And this is a Semang man.
###1288 And the Semang are completely different-looking.
###1291 They live in Malaysia,
###1292 but they don't look like the rest of the population at all.
###1294 They're much darker-skinned.
###1296 Some people have even gone as far
###1297 as to say that they look African in appearance.
###1300 And I just wonder whether their appearance is telling us something
###1304 about their ancient ancestry.
###1310 The rainforest is disappearing around them
###1313 and many now work on rubber plantations and logging camps.
###1318 But they are still proud of their hunter-gatherer traditions.
###1324 (TWIG SNAPS)
###1331 I'm really noisy.
###1334 They're so stealthy.
###1338 And I'm stepping on twigs and things.
###1352 Excellent. I'm gonna have a go as well.
###1357 (BLOWING)
###1360 Okay!
###1361 (LAUGHING)
###1369 ROBERTS: And the girls also offer to pass their hunting skills on to me.
###1382 Oh, it's just brilliant. They're all just wedged under this rock,
###1385 desperately scrambling underneath it, trying to get those fish.
###1388 (LAUGHING) He's tiny!
###1396 They're actually underwater now,
###1398 just feeling around under stones and grabbing these fish.
###1400 And the whole thing is just great fun.
###1402 You know, they're schoolgirls having a laugh,
###1404 finding a bit of food along the way.
###1410 And it's very sad that it's a way of life that isn't
###1415 going to be possible for much longer, I don't think.
###1420 But the most revealing clue isn't the Semang's way of life
###1425 or their appearance.
###1428 It's invisible to the naked eye, hidden inside them.
###1435 Amazingly, through their DNA it might be possible
###1440 to trace that first great journey through Malaysia.
###1446 Genetics expert Stephen oppenheimer has flown in from oxford.
###1451 His work is helping revolutionise the story of our human journey.
###1457 STEPHEN: I guess it's something like a detective story,
###1459 where you've got a very specific trail, which you can measure,
###1463 just like traditional trackers,
###1466 where they'll follow a trail which nobody else could see.
###1470 ROBERTS: Combining genes and geography,
###1472 Stephen has mapped out a route from Africa, across the Red Sea
###1476 and around the edge of the Indian ocean.
###1479 By looking at the DNA of the Semang,
###1482 Stephen hopes to find evidence of that early migration towards Australia.
###1486 STEPHEN: The new genetics is extraordinarily powerful
###1489 for looking at ancient migrations,
###1491 because not only can you trace very specific migrations,
###1495 but you can actually attempt to date them as well.
###1498 (DRUMS BEATING)
###1504 (SINGING IN LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###1508 ROBERTS: Stephen has been looking for unique genetic markers
###1511 that will tell him when the ancestors of the Semang first arrived here.
###1519 What about dates? Because they certainly think they've been here forever.
###1522 -They think they're very ancient. -I agree with them.
###1524 -You do? -Yes.
###1525 So they've been here 60,000 years? The ancestors have been here...
###1528 STEPHEN: At least 60,000. I suspect it was much, much more.
###1531 I mean, that's amazing, 'cause if their uniqueness goes back that far,
###1537 and, you know, if we can say that they have
###1540 probably been here in this sort of area for 60,000 years,
###1544 that means they were very close to the wave of colonisation, doesn't it?
###1549 They were part of it. They were in the vanguard.
###1552 -Yeah. -They were just a colony dropped
###1554 along the way as the vanguard advanced down towards New Guinea and Australia.
###1561 ROBERTS: It's incredibly frustrating that the first family groups
###1564 pushing through these new lands left so little for us to find.
###1569 But genetics has come to the rescue.
###1572 Stephen's research tells us that the ancestors of the Semang were probably
###1576 amongst the first modern humans to come through here.
###1580 And not only that, the genetics suggests that
###1583 that vanguard moved surprisingly rapidly,
###1586 getting all the way from Africa to Malaysia
###1588 in the space of just a few thousand years.
###1594 There are other tribes thought to have ancient roots as well.
###1597 Together they are like distant echoes of that first migration,
###1602 a journey that began in Africa, continued through India
###1607 and round the coast to Malaysia.
###1610 But did they carry on?
###1613 After the Malay Peninsula, the land runs out,
###1617 breaking into a mass of islands.
###1629 But using a computer program which models past climate,
###1633 it's possible to go back in time
###1635 and see what the map looked like thousands of years ago.
###1640 And if we run the climate computer back through time -
###1644 we're racing through tens of thousands of years here -
###1647 we can see that those islands are starting to join up.
###1650 And in fact a lot of the islands
###1652 that make up modern-day Malaysia and Indonesia
###1655 are all joining together to become part of the continent.
###1662 They could have got all the way here to Borneo
###1666 without getting their feet wet.
###1671 So much may be lost under the sea.
###1676 But there is something.
###1686 During the Second World War, Englishman Major Tom Harrison
###1690 parachuted into Borneo on a special-forces mission.
###1694 He encouraged local tribes to use the ancient practice of headhunting
###1699 against the Japanese.
###1708 After the war, Harrison, a keen archaeologist, stayed on...
###1717 and began investigating the legendary Niah cave.
###1728 Oh, I've seen pictures of the great cave at Niah,
###1732 but nothing really prepares you for the sheer scale of it.
###1778 Harrison launched a major excavation.
###1781 He had a hunch that these caves
###1784 would have made the perfect home for early humans.
###1794 This part of the excavation was known as ''Hell Trench''.
###1798 And stepping down into it, it's easy to see why,
###1801 because it's suddenly very hot and humid.
###1804 But all the hard work and the discomfort paid off,
###1807 because the archaeologists found something
###1810 that was quite phenomenal.
###1813 It's a human skull.
###1815 It was in many pieces when it was first found,
###1818 which have been carefully fitted back together like a jigsaw.
###1823 And this is the top of the skull.
###1825 It's unmistakably a modern human, it has a high, domed forehead.
###1831 The skull has been dated to nearly 40,000 years old,
###1836 the oldest confirmed remains of our species in Southeast Asia.
###1844 But Niah cave also offers us a clue as to how these people survived
###1849 in the challenging environment of the rainforest.
###1853 (BIRDS SCREECHING)
###1858 As you move just a little bit deeper into the cave,
###1860 it becomes significantly cooler and more pleasant.
###1863 And it just feels like an ideal place for those hunter-gatherers
###1866 to have set up their camps.
###1868 And then they could have gone off roaming into the forest.
###1871 The archaeological evidence shows that they were bringing back
###1873 a huge range of different foods to eat,
###1876 from monkeys and pigs and lizards, to shellfish, yams and sago palm.
###1883 Compared with other species, we're incredibly adaptable.
###1887 To survive, we humans will eat just about anything.
###1892 And as if to make exactly that point, in another corner of the cave
###1896 something really unusual is going on.
###1901 I've arrived at harvesting time for the ingredient used in the Chinese delicacy
###1906 bird's nest soup.
###1907 It's made from the nests of rare swiftlets,
###1910 and today these men are attempting a death-defying feat to gather them.
###1916 Well, this is human ingenuity, isn't it?
###1930 A sweet little tiny swiftlet's nest.
###1932 It has just been built out from the wall of the cave.
###1936 Made of saliva.
###1939 It feels a bit like resin or something. It's very odd.
###1943 I can't believe that anybody would want to make soup out of it.
###1949 The ability to survive in the rainforest would have helped people
###1953 spread through these islands.
###1955 But discoveries on Flores suggest there may have been another challenge
###1960 for the first modern humans in this part of the world.
###1968 The Indonesian jungle is full of life.
###1972 There are animals in there of every shape and size,
###1975 some of them more friendly than others.
###1978 (GROWLING)
###1981 Every year more species are discovered,
###1984 and the jungle still has secrets to reveal.
###1987 It seems that however much we think we know
###1991 about the other creatures we share the planet with,
###1995 there are always new surprises.
###2002 Today on Flores, local people still tell stories of strange human-like creatures,
###2009 the cave-dwelling Ebu Gogo.
###2014 So I'd really, really like to know more about the story of Ebu Gogo.
###2019 (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###2021 MAN: According to our ancestors,
###2024 there were Ebu Gogo in our land, in our village, a long time ago.
###2028 Around the 1 5th century.
###2030 Are they humans? I mean, are they like us?
###2034 MAN: They had two distinctive characteristics -
###2037 they were like monkeys, but also like humans.
###2044 Their physical features were short, hefty,
###2051 with long hair on the head and chest,
###2054 and the females' breasts were big and long.
###2060 If they wanted to walk,
###2062 they usually threw their long breasts over their shoulders.
###2071 But nobody's seen one for a couple of hundred years?
###2076 MAN: They really did exist, and they were destroyed by our ancestors
###2081 about seven generations ago.
###2085 (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###2089 MAN: There were two reasons for their elimination.
###2092 Firstly, because they stole food,
###2094 and secondly, because they kidnapped our children.
###2101 ROBERTS: This sounds like the sort of spooky myths you might hear anywhere.
###2107 But believe it or not, this story may actually have some truth to it.
###2119 Archaeologists were excavating in this cave on the island,
###2122 looking for signs of the earliest modern humans,
###2125 when they made a startling discovery.
###2129 At first they thought they'd found the skeleton of a child.
###2133 But when they cleaned up the bones,
###2134 they realised it was actually a tiny adult.
###2139 A small-bodied, small-brained creature,
###2143 a type of human that nobody had ever seen before.
###2147 It quickly became known as ''The Hobbit''.
###2153 So this is the skeleton of this minute woman
###2157 that the archaeologists found
###2159 in the cave of Liang Bua on the island of Flores.
###2162 And she is just absolutely tiny.
###2164 When she was standing at her full height,
###2166 she would have reached to about a metre tall.
###2169 She seems like an odd combination.
###2172 Some bits look like us, but in miniature,
###2174 other parts look like more ancient human species.
###2179 People still are unsure about exactly who she is.
###2183 Most people believe that she is, indeed, a different species.
###2185 So it really does make us rethink what we think about ourselves
###2190 and what we think about the whole human family as well.
###2194 Could The Hobbit have affected our ancestors'journey?
###2198 Dating of the bones shows they were here
###2200 around the time of the migration of our ancestors through Indonesia.
###2207 So would they have encountered this race,
###2209 this population of very tiny people?
###2213 And what would have happened if they did?
###2215 I don't know what they would have thought about Homo sapiens.
###2223 If they really were the vicious Ebu Gogo,
###2226 our ancestors might have been best advised to avoid Flores.
###2237 But to reach Australia, those early pioneers would have had to face
###2241 the greatest challenge of all,
###2243 one that was there even 60,000 years ago.
###2249 The deep seas around Australia.
###2258 I've arrived in Lombok,
###2260 one of a string of Indonesian islands, stepping stones to Australia.
###2273 Nobody's ever found evidence of a boat from this long ago,
###2277 but Austrian Robert Bednarik
###2279 has been trying to work out what sort of sea craft our ancestors might have had.
###2286 He's been building prehistoric rafts for over a decade.
###2291 His philosophy is simple..
###2293 his rafts can be built with the tools and materials
###2296 that would have been available to early humans.
###2298 But not all of them have been successful.
###2303 That is the most primitive model we've built so far.
###2307 This one is the most primitive? Great.
###2309 But it's also the most... Hopefully, the most effective.
###2317 ROBERTS: I hope so, because I'm going to go on it.
###2320 Robert has used something that would have been available
###2322 to the first Indonesians, just as it is today -
###2325 bamboo.
###2328 We know they were clever, so... As clever as us.
###2331 So if we look around and go, ''Well, bamboo looks great'' -
###2334 I mean, that's a fantastic material to use -
###2336 then undoubtedly, you know, they'd have been onto that as well.
###2340 We're going to attempt to cross a stretch of open sea to the next island.
###2346 It's nothing like the distance to Australia,
###2349 but an excellent test of the principle.
###2352 The raft is very basic. No sail, no shade.
###2357 And nothing to stop the water getting through.
###2360 Are we really going to sea on this?
###2364 Do they think we're mad, going out on this raft?
###2366 Ask him, go on, now, ask him.
###2368 (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###2375 Yeah, no problem.
###2376 -No problem? -No problem.
###2379 -So I'm in safe hands, then? -He say it depend on the weather.
###2383 Might there be a storm tomorrow?
###2385 (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###2387 MAN: We cannot say ''no'' and we cannot say ''yes''.
###2391 For me, I worry about the sun.
###2394 -If hot sun? -Yeah.
###2397 (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###2400 He worry about the wind.
###2402 And he worry of the current coming and we cannot get there.
###2407 Okay. What do they think of the rafts compared to their normal boats?
###2412 No, they happen like when the boat is...
###2414 -Yeah. -Yeah.
###2416 Losing everything, machine, everything.
###2419 -I think... -You think we're gonna tip over?
###2424 -What? -Could it capsize?
###2425 Yeah.
###2431 ROBERTS: The message is clear.
###2433 No matter how well prepared we are, the elements will determine our fate.
###2440 Which is why the fishermen won't even contemplate this voyage
###2444 without the help of the local mystic.
###2447 We all have to be blessed as protection against the spirit of the sea.
###2462 (SHOUTING IN LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###2469 Just launching the raft is hard enough. It is incredibly heavy.
###2494 It's really heavy,
###2496 and it was quite an effort to actually get it into the water,
###2498 but we did it.
###2499 And we're now making really good speed.
###2507 ROBERTS: Are we headed in the right direction?
###2508 MAN: I hope so.
###2509 ROBERTS: Yeah. MAN: I hope.
###2511 ROBERTS: on a paddle-powered raft, we are totally at the mercy of currents,
###2516 just as our ancestors would have been.
###2520 We think the current should start pulling us north,
###2524 then as we get halfway across, turn south.
###2528 So we won't be able to head straight across.
###2532 And if we get it wrong, we'll end up in the Indian ocean.
###2541 So what does Robert's decidedly non-Stone Age GPS tell us?
###2547 -So we're heading north, Robert? -It's excellent.
###2550 So we might make it in five hours if we...
###2552 No, no, no, we're probably being pulled by the current now.
###2554 Right. So you think that...
###2555 We're offshore, we're getting this northern current.
###2557 So you think the good speed that we're doing is actually the current?
###2560 Some of the speed is the current, yes.
###2561 Okay? I don't believe that we are actually doing this.
###2563 (LAUGHS)
###2565 Does anyone know any good paddling songs?
###2567 (MAN SINGING IN LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###2595 What's going on with the seat?
###2597 It makes me wonder how those early sea crossings happened.
###2602 Perhaps families were out fishing and got carried off by rogue currents,
###2607 and arrived in Australia by chance.
###2610 That's better.
###2614 or maybe desperation pushed some to look for a new island to live on,
###2619 but I doubt it was planned.
###2622 Australia was far beyond the horizon.
###2631 So are the currents going to change direction now?
###2634 -We don't know. -We don't know.
###2635 Adds an element of excitement.
###2637 Makes it difficult to head for somewhere in particular, though.
###2643 At the halfway stage, it all seems rather easy.
###2647 The plan is working perfectly.
###2650 But over towards Sumbawa, trouble is looming.
###2659 ROBERTS: I suddenly feel very small in a very big sea.
###2680 our destination is an inviting, sandy beach.
###2685 But just a few hundred metres from safety,
###2687 we're suddenly trapped in a rip current, pulling us back out to sea.
###2698 (ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
###2705 The current just keeps on dragging us from side to side,
###2707 and we're headed for this...
###2708 There's a beach right up ahead with some big breakers.
###2712 I don't speak Indonesian, but they're saying to me we're gonna do that.
###2717 And the beach we've been aiming for is looking more and more distant.
###2722 The current just swept us round this headland.
###2724 We were level with that headland and heading for the beach.
###2727 And now we're gonna have to go and try
###2729 to go round the other side of the headland. I don't know.
###2732 There's massive breakers there.
###2735 It's starting to look a bit nasty.
###2739 We've been paddling since daybreak, and now it's starting to get dark.
###2743 But as far as the eye can see,
###2745 there's a line of breakers over a coral reef,
###2747 stopping us from landing.
###2751 The crew is concerned that there is a continuous coral reef here,
###2756 and to get through those breakers we are likely to hit that.
###2762 I'm really worried that we're gonna get swept in by these breakers.
###2765 We're getting very close.
###2767 MAN ON RADIO: Are you getting too close to the rocks?
###2769 Copy that. We're getting too close to the rocks.
###2771 We're getting too close to the breakers.
###2772 We're going to carry on due south, so straight in the direction we're going.
###2777 At last, there's a gap in the reef.
###2819 We proved it was possible to cross open sea on a bamboo raft,
###2824 with no sail or engine.
###2826 But it was a frightening experience.
###2829 Could our ancestors really have made it to Australia?
###2833 Today, that's a crossing of nearly 500 kilometres.
###2844 Well, I've found a clue that makes me think they could have done it,
###2847 and even hints at when.
###2852 Running the climate-change sequence for this part of the world,
###2856 I'm particularly interested in what's going on
###2858 between 60 and 80,000 years ago,
###2861 because that's the time period at which we think
###2864 the first Australian colonisers would have been en route.
###2868 And there seems to be a remarkable window of opportunity.
###2872 At about 65,000 years ago,
###2875 the sea level drops about 1 00 metres below its present-day levels.
###2880 And the distance between Timor and the northern coast of Australia
###2884 is reduced to 1 53 kilometres.
###2888 65,000 years ago.
###2891 Could this really have been the chance to cross the sea to Australia?
###2899 It would make a nice end
###2901 to that faint trail of evidence that I followed all the way
###2904 through India and Malaysia, but it is only a suggestion.
###2916 Can I find any real evidence that this is what happened?
###2923 I'm heading through the swamps of the Northern Territories,
###2926 because it's here in the north that I hope to find clues
###2929 to the earliest Australians.
###2938 I am slightly nervous, Gabby,
###2939 'cause there are crocodiles around, aren't there?
###2948 -Do you think we're safe in this boat? -Yeah, we're pretty safe.
###2953 Pretty safe?
###2955 (LAUGHING)
###2960 This is the point at which Gabby and an entire BBC film crew
###2963 put themselves into my hands.
###2966 Very slowly.
###2968 Getting around in the wet season isn't easy.
###2973 There's a fish there.
###2975 But at last, this is what I've been looking for.
###2988 When you're looking for clues this ancient, they are few and far between.
###2992 But this area of Australia is actually rich in a different kind of evidence
###2997 of early humans.
###2999 Evidence of art.
###3001 And this is how the archaeologists know.
###3003 Well, this is ochre. And this is ochre in its natural state.
###3008 These pebbles form out of the rocks here.
###3011 But what the archaeologists have found in a couple of rock shelters
###3014 here in the Northern Territories,
###3016 is ochre that has been ground down and used as a pigment.
###3021 And they've dated the pigments, and some go back almost to 60,000 years ago.
###3030 That's not long after sea levels were at their lowest.
###3034 People really might have reached Australia by 60,000 years ago.
###3043 Those same pigments are still being used today
###3046 by Aboriginal Australian artists in recording the stories of their people.
###3054 And I'm really keen to meet some of these artists,
###3058 to find out more about what their art means to them.
###3068 I've heard of remote sacred sites where I might find images
###3073 of their creation story.
###3077 Artists Garry Djorlom and Wilfred Nawirridj
###3080 agree to take me on a trip into the bush.
###3094 As we make our journey, they're constantly on the lookout
###3098 for anything they can use.
###3101 What are you looking for, Wilfred?
###3114 ROBERTS: Oh, yeah! Yeah. Instant brush.
###3130 It's very strange, because I'm sort of looking round
###3131 and just seeing plants everywhere and you're seeing food.
###3135 Bush passion fruit, apparently.
###3138 That is like a tiny little passion fruit.
###3146 Delicious.
###3149 Garry and Wilfred's families have become settled,
###3152 but they still go off to look for food in the bush just as their ancestors did.
###3161 Oh, that's beautiful.
###3164 Is it still a special place for you?
###3167 ROBERTS: Yeah.
###3171 Oh, they lived here?
###3175 A long time ago? So grandfathers many generations back? Yeah.
###3184 From here I can see a beautiful view.
###3189 But for Garry's ancestors this was a place to survey the land,
###3193 pick out distant game and plan their meals.
###3231 ROBERTS: Eventually, at the entrance to a rock shelter,
###3234 we come across our first piece of ancient art.
###3240 Oh, that's beautiful.
###3244 There's so many images, all sort of on top of each other
###3248 and jostling for room.
###3255 ROBERTS: Yeah, yeah.
###3261 Right. So this all represents the sort of animals that you can eat.
###3269 Yeah.
###3281 But what they've really brought me here to see is further up the hill,
###3286 deep within these rocks.
###3291 It's like a maze.
###3299 (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)
###3307 (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)
###3310 Okay.
###3313 ROBERTS: Oh, wow!
###3316 What a strange picture. What is it?
###3324 ROBERTS: Right. So all those little bags hanging from her,
###3327 they've all got babies in them?
###3330 And where did she come from?
###3348 ROBERTS: This is remarkable.
###3350 Traditionally, Aboriginal Australians believe
###3353 they were formed by creative beings who also made their land.
###3359 But here on the northern coast
###3362 they believe their creation mother came from across the sea.
###3366 A strange echo of a story told by fossils, stones and genes.
###3378 However unlikely it seemed, discoveries have convinced me
###3383 that these Aboriginal Australians, just like me,
###3387 are descendants of that small group who left Africa.
###3393 And that they really could have reached Australia by around 60,000 years ago.
###3402 What seemed an unlikely journey may actually have been one of our first.
###3412 So I've come to the end of this particular journey.
###3415 And the people I've met along the way have helped me to understand more
###3419 about the essential human characteristics
###3422 that we all share -
###3424 ingenuity, resourcefulness and adaptability.
###3428 And for me, the Aboriginal Australians in particular
###3433 seem to have held on to something I think so many of us feel we've lost
###3436 in the 21 st century,
###3438 a really intense physical and spiritual connection
###3443 with their landscape and environment.
###3447 So it's been a journey about retracing that migration
###3451 from Africa to Australia,
###3453 but it's also been about what it really means to be human.
