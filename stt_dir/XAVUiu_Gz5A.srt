0:0:17,8 --> 0:0:21,455
American Alligators are apex predators in the Everglades.


2
0:0:21,455 --> 0:0:26,958
They can grow between 10 to 12 feet in length and 
 they don’t have very many enemies at that size.


3
0:0:26,958 --> 0:0:57,28
Especially snakes.


4
0:0:57,28 --> 0:1:1,115
There is a new type of predator surfacing in the Everglades these days.


5
0:1:1,115 --> 0:1:3,0
Burmese Pythons.


6
0:1:3,0 --> 0:1:54,6
Alligators, especially adult alligators are certainly not used to being attacked by snakes.


7
0:1:54,6 --> 0:2:59,9
In this extremely rare footage, an overly aggressive Burmese 
 Python actually attacks a full grown American Alligator.


8
0:2:59,9 --> 0:3:5,67
A python of this size normally is no match for an adult alligator.


9
0:3:5,67 --> 0:3:9,7
However, nature does take an extreme turn form time to time.


10
0:3:9,7 --> 0:3:15,815
And in this instance, instead of the alligator tearing up the snake to shreds,


11
0:3:15,815 --> 0:5:15,815
It’s actually intimidated by the python and retreats.
