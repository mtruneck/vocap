2
0:0:56,96 --> 0:0:58,21
RAY LATYPOV: My brother,
Nurulla.


3
0:0:58,21 --> 0:1:52,47



4
0:1:52,47 --> 0:1:54,94
JIM DIMASCIO: I came aboard
serving as our Chief Operating


5
0:1:54,94 --> 0:1:57,96
Officer in charge of marketing,
and Ray serves as


6
0:1:57,96 --> 0:2:2,3
our CEO, and Nurulla serves as
our Chief Technology Officer.


7
0:2:2,3 --> 0:2:6,92
Ray and Nurulla, they invented
Virtusphere for the immersive


8
0:2:6,92 --> 0:2:8,41
and virtual reality
experience.


9
0:2:8,41 --> 0:2:11,61
The Virtusphere is a new,
innovative technology that


10
0:2:11,61 --> 0:2:13,95
really is a locomotion
simulator.


11
0:2:13,95 --> 0:2:16,43
And just to define locomotion,
it doesn't have anything to do


12
0:2:16,43 --> 0:2:18,32
with trains, but the
movement of people.


13
0:2:18,32 --> 0:2:21,52
The ability of being able to get
inside and walk or run in


14
0:2:21,52 --> 0:2:23,76
a north, east, south,
or west direction.


15
0:2:23,76 --> 0:2:27,57
It's a 10-foot sphere in its
diameter, and sits on a round


16
0:2:27,57 --> 0:2:30,39
base of 11 sections of steel.


17
0:2:30,39 --> 0:2:32,48
So it's affectionately
nicknamed the


18
0:2:32,48 --> 0:2:33,95
hamster ball for humans.


19
0:2:33,95 --> 0:2:36,8
Virtusphere could really bring
a brand new experience.


20
0:2:36,8 --> 0:2:40,7
And again, not to keep going
back, but also to get some


21
0:2:40,7 --> 0:2:44,58
exercise, so that you're not
just sitting at your PC in a


22
0:2:44,58 --> 0:2:47,84
chair for extended periods of
time, whether it be one hour


23
0:2:47,84 --> 0:2:49,22
or four hours.


24
0:2:49,22 --> 0:2:51,2
But once you're inside
Virtusphere, you're really


25
0:2:51,2 --> 0:2:54,11
going to get an interactive
experience with exercise.


26
0:2:54,11 --> 0:2:56,8
And that's a win-win in today's
modern economy.


27
0:2:56,8 --> 0:3:1,91



28
0:3:1,91 --> 0:3:5,1
It's actually been a very
effective start, as we are a


29
0:3:5,1 --> 0:3:6,51
true start-up in the new


30
0:3:6,51 --> 0:3:8,81
locomotion simulation business.


31
0:3:8,81 --> 0:3:11,39
We're very excited to have you
here today, and we're very


32
0:3:11,39 --> 0:3:14,48
much looking forward to showing
you our technology.


33
0:3:14,48 --> 0:3:18,6
And now we're approaching the
office of Virtusphere, And


34
0:3:18,6 --> 0:3:21,39
very excited to get everybody's
impression of our


35
0:3:21,39 --> 0:3:23,95
Virtusphere technology.


36
0:3:23,95 --> 0:3:25,55
This is Virtusphere.


37
0:3:25,55 --> 0:3:26,52
This is how it works.


38
0:3:26,52 --> 0:3:30,146
A person can get inside,
and can start walking.


39
0:3:30,146 --> 0:3:34,66



40
0:3:34,66 --> 0:3:37,34
And change directions, which
is much different than a


41
0:3:37,34 --> 0:3:38,79
conventional treadmill.


42
0:3:38,79 --> 0:3:48,88
You can go in any direction,
and with a little practice,


43
0:3:48,88 --> 0:3:50,6
you can jog.


44
0:3:50,6 --> 0:3:52,91
And that's the physics of
Virtusphere, and that's just


45
0:3:52,91 --> 0:3:53,54
the beginning.


46
0:3:53,54 --> 0:3:56,43
A person can get exercise,
as you can even tell.


47
0:3:56,43 --> 0:3:59,82
After a person gets out of
Virtusphere, you know you've


48
0:3:59,82 --> 0:4:1,315
gotten a little bit
of a work out.


49
0:4:1,315 --> 0:4:4,24



50
0:4:4,24 --> 0:4:6,66
But that's just the physics of
Virtusphere, and how you can


51
0:4:6,66 --> 0:4:7,55
walk or right.


52
0:4:7,55 --> 0:4:9,71
Now what we're going to show
you is the technology part,


53
0:4:9,71 --> 0:4:11,38
and this is the real fun part.


54
0:4:11,38 --> 0:4:12,482
Hey, Ray.


55
0:4:12,482 --> 0:4:14,82
Hey, Nurulla.


56
0:4:14,82 --> 0:4:21,36



57
0:4:21,36 --> 0:4:22,91
JIM DIMASCIO: Sounds good.


58
0:4:22,91 --> 0:4:56,552



59
0:4:56,552 --> 0:4:58,496
RAY LATYPOV: Here's our--
to go inside.


60
0:4:58,496 --> 0:5:3,842



61
0:5:3,842 --> 0:5:5,92
Should we close that?


62
0:5:5,92 --> 0:5:9,65



63
0:5:9,65 --> 0:6:0,22



64
0:6:0,22 --> 0:6:3,19
JIM DIMASCIO: Today, most people
play the game via their


65
0:6:3,19 --> 0:6:5,77
couch, their PC monitor,
their desk chair.


66
0:6:5,77 --> 0:6:8,26
But with Virtusphere, you truly
get immersed into your


67
0:6:8,26 --> 0:6:9,51
virtual reality experience.


68
0:6:9,51 --> 0:8:9,51
