1
0:0:3,419 --> 0:0:9,86
i don't even want to cut down that branch..that
other thing unless we can move it somewhere


2
0:0:9,86 --> 0:0:15,62
but we're going to cut that branch down.
Jacque and Roxanne appear to be resting up


3
0:0:15,62 --> 0:0:20,93
and recovering from lecturing about 7 months
abroad. Sorry to the people in Canada for


4
0:0:20,93 --> 0:0:28,16
the last few lectures that had to be canceled.
Also anyone out there that is able to do transcribing


5
0:0:28,16 --> 0:0:33,64
for some of the talks if you could contact
me we'd be very grateful for that if you could


6
0:0:33,64 --> 0:0:40,999
send me an email. This talk Jacque gave August
12, 2010 and I'll be uploading over the next


7
0:0:40,999 --> 0:0:42,59
few days in parts.


8
0:0:42,59 --> 0:0:54,26
Jacque - We're talking about investigating
the nature of human behavior. I think that


9
0:0:54,26 --> 0:1:2,989
what might help, is if you go back in time
and take some primitive people, when I say


10
0:1:2,989 --> 0:1:11,35
primitive I mean like outlined districts,
headhunters of the Amazon. If you open a watch


11
0:1:11,35 --> 0:1:19,88
and show them the back mechanism, they can't
say how complex how beautifully machined.


12
0:1:19,88 --> 0:1:21,619
They can't do that, you understand why? anyone
got a problem with that?


13
0:1:21,619 --> 0:1:22,25
hold on, this video's not on. It's
on camera.


14
0:1:22,25 --> 0:1:22,5
Yeah, press record.


15
0:1:22,5 --> 0:1:31,57
Roxanne - Yeah I thought you had done that,
sorry, yeah ok go ahead Jacque


16
0:1:31,57 --> 0:1:44,499
Jacque - You gotta listen to every word because
they can't do it. Now, if a psychologist wants


17
0:1:44,499 --> 0:1:51,359
to know how the brain works. (Say or neurologist,
what it does have you move your fingers?)


18
0:1:51,359 --> 0:1:58,59
and pick up what area of the brain is active.
You understand? Then thinking, solving problems


19
0:1:58,59 --> 0:2:6,579
so they can map out what area becomes active.
That's all they can do. But they can't tell


20
0:2:6,579 --> 0:2:13,19
you if it's right wrong good or bad. They
can map out areas of the brain by hitting


21
0:2:13,19 --> 0:2:18,75
your knee and getting - picking up electronic
signals, from different parts of the brain,


22
0:2:18,75 --> 0:2:30,65
you can map out the brain. But that doesn't
tell you how the brain works. Do you understand


23
0:2:30,65 --> 0:2:35,76
that up to now. Ok. There are many people
who try to study the mind, you can't study


24
0:2:35,76 --> 0:2:45,73
the mind. It's like taking primitive technology,
way back a hundred years ago, giving them


25
0:2:45,73 --> 0:2:51,37
a transistor, saying 'what is it?' - they
can't say what it is. They don't know what


26
0:2:51,37 --> 0:2:57,599
a transistor is. They don't know what a capacitor
is. They don't know what a vacuum tube is.


27
0:2:57,599 --> 0:3:5,42
So alls they can do is cut it. Now if you
bring a chemist in, he can tell you what comprises


28
0:3:5,42 --> 0:3:11,629
a transistor - certain amount of magnesium,
silicone - you know what i mean? But he can't


29
0:3:11,629 --> 0:3:17,29
tell you what it is. Is that real clear? Studying
the brain does not tell you anything about


30
0:3:17,29 --> 0:3:24,829
it. You have to study the brain's reaction
in relation to the environment. The brain


31
0:3:24,829 --> 0:3:30,39
is a responding mechanism. When you shine
a bright light in the eye it responds. So


32
0:3:30,39 --> 0:3:36,129
you can say, this is how much of a response,
how little a response, But you can't tell


33
0:3:36,129 --> 0:3:43,739
what it is. Studying the brain gives you nothing,
unless you study it in relationship to the


34
0:3:43,739 --> 0:3:51,469
environment. A bird with wings can't fly where
there's no air, and it'll stop flying if you


35
0:3:51,469 --> 0:3:57,65
can put an oxygen mask on the bird and he'll
flap his wings and he won't get off the ground,


36
0:3:57,65 --> 0:4:5,159
he wont even try to fly after a while. Only
with air there will he move. You understand?


37
0:4:5,159 --> 0:4:13,819
Now if you beat down one wing with more pressure,
you turn the wing into the wind, and beat


38
0:4:13,819 --> 0:4:21,97
down, he'll bank. A bird does not know how
to fly instinctively. He beats his wings different


39
0:4:21,97 --> 0:4:27,1
ways and if it gets him to where he wants
to go (by turning down?) he moves forward.


40
0:4:27,1 --> 0:4:34,16
If he turns it this way he stops in midair,
if he's a humming bird. So the bird responds


41
0:4:34,16 --> 0:4:40,91
 - studying the bird you have to study the
environment the bird lives in. Do you understand


42
0:4:40,91 --> 0:4:47,94
that? There's no way you can dissect the brain
and say this is what a mans like, except in


43
0:4:47,94 --> 0:4:58,85
context of the environment. Is that real clear?
So, if I wanna study human behavior, what


44
0:4:58,85 --> 0:5:6,46
i'm really studying is the reactions of human
beings in a given environment. I can't study


45
0:5:6,46 --> 0:5:12,84
human behavior, I can study their reactions.
When somethings hot they move away from it.


46
0:5:12,84 --> 0:5:19,45
When it's cold they might move toward it,
it all depends. If a man goes down to the


47
0:5:19,45 --> 0:5:27,45
river and he reaches for it, he usually can't
get it. If he hits it with a club its faster


48
0:5:27,45 --> 0:5:36,33
than his hand reaction, he might catch fish
that way, clubbing them. So what you can do


49
0:5:36,33 --> 0:5:42,93
 - The primitive brain doesn't look any different.
If you have a billion associations with boo


50
0:5:42,93 --> 0:5:51,3
boo, a bunch of metaphysical stuff, billions
of associations, they are (calming?) because


51
0:5:51,3 --> 0:5:57,29
you believe somebody who gave you those associations
to know what they're talking about. You don't


52
0:5:57,29 --> 0:6:3,25
even have to know what they're talking about,
if the chief says something it's so. If the


53
0:6:3,25 --> 0:6:9,33
king says something it's so. If a politician
says something its so. Right now they're concerned


54
0:6:9,33 --> 0:6:16,54
with foreclosures on banks. They're concerned
with giving banks money, and the banks didn't


55
0:6:16,54 --> 0:6:24,13
use that money for the purpose intended. So
they have words like fraud. You can't do anything


56
0:6:24,13 --> 0:6:34,53
that way, you have to take in the whole picture
and ask, what is it that you want? So I have


57
0:6:34,53 --> 0:6:41,64
drawings of different cities, those cities
have an end goal they're not just cities.


58
0:6:41,64 --> 0:6:49,21
The goals of those cities are to make things
relevant to people that they respond to. There's


59
0:6:49,21 --> 0:6:56,25
no other way. Now people that live in the
city, have many different reactions to the


60
0:6:56,25 --> 0:7:2,43
city - 'it's my home, my grandfather was born
there - my favorite city' but they really


61
0:7:2,43 --> 0:7:10,93
don't understand what a city is, what it serves.
Now they use words like shelter, home is a


62
0:7:10,93 --> 0:7:20,0
shelter, but when you wear a diving suit and
you go underwater, thats a closed environment,


63
0:7:20,0 --> 0:7:27,52
shelter for underwater living. If a man goes
out into space he brings with him the air


64
0:7:27,52 --> 0:7:36,21
in his suit and in that suit he has all kinds
of equipment he may need on that mission.


65
0:7:36,21 --> 0:7:42,5
If you give him a book, a novel to take out
into space, it's dead weight, it doesn't serve


66
0:7:42,5 --> 0:7:48,75
anything. If you give him an emergency book
of what to do, when oxygen stops or something


67
0:7:48,75 --> 0:7:56,41
goes wrong, that's something. But a book about
how seminal indians treat fish, would have


68
0:7:56,41 --> 0:8:4,62
no use in space. Our society is loaded with
'how seminal Indians treat fish'. there's


69
0:8:4,62 --> 0:8:11,21
lots of superfluous information superfluous
to the needs of people. Must everything be


70
0:8:11,21 --> 0:8:21,74
scientific? If it is not it's less valid.
Is there a place for none scientific? By none


71
0:8:21,74 --> 0:8:29,59
scientific do you mean, speculative notions?
or scientific is 'I don't know, let's try


72
0:8:29,59 --> 0:8:36,6
to find out' does it mean you'll find out?
Not necessarily. You'll find out if you have


73
0:8:36,6 --> 0:8:45,699
the appropriate needs, so you can't ask 'what
is the brain?' Or 'how does it work?' except


74
0:8:45,699 --> 0:8:55,29
for context of the situation. I think there's
some animals that respond to largeness. A


75
0:8:55,29 --> 0:9:2,75
bear when he stands up, he doesn't try to
impress you with his size when he stands up,


76
0:9:2,75 --> 0:9:8,98
he stands up and if you react he just stands
up again. But it's not 'I'm going stand up


77
0:9:8,98 --> 0:9:15,37
so i'll look bigger, so I'll scare the guy'
a bear doesn't think that way. The neurologist


78
0:9:15,37 --> 0:9:22,42
that wants to study human behavior is brought
up to believe in free will to start with so


79
0:9:22,42 --> 0:9:29,49
he's already jammed. He's already hurt, 'cause
he can't look at anything objectively there's


80
0:9:29,49 --> 0:9:37,68
no such thing. He can only write down when
a man see's lava if he sticks his finger


81
0:9:37,68 --> 0:9:42,319
in it burns he stays away from it. He can
only do that. Now the chemist wants to know


82
0:9:42,319 --> 0:9:49,839
what lava is. He says 'there's so much magnesium,
so much melted rock' but he still puts a label


83
0:9:49,839 --> 0:9:58,759
on it he calls it ‘lava’. That means a word
used assigned to something. If a person misbehaves


84
0:9:58,759 --> 0:10:6,709
or behaves very badly, or behavior unrelated
to the situation, like I've seen a kid get


85
0:10:6,709 --> 0:10:14,89
run over by a car and the mother says 'he
can't be dead he must be alive. He can't be


86
0:10:14,89 --> 0:10:21,589
dead' - meaning the situation is unacceptable.
She's responding more on a feeling tone rather


87
0:10:21,589 --> 0:10:29,29
than relevant. Sometimes of you like somebody
and die immediately you say 'he can't be dead


88
0:10:29,29 --> 0:10:35,91
he was just (old?) having a bowl of oatmeal'
you know? so, you can't do that. You can only


89
0:10:35,91 --> 0:10:49,54
say that 'I didn't expect that' or 'highly
improbable, I thought it was anyway.' You


90
0:10:49,54 --> 0:10:52,579
can only talk about your relationship so,
if you meet with a person and say, I'm going


91
0:10:52,579 --> 0:11:0,509
to exaggerate here, they have a thousand neural
associations y'know? In the brain, and then


92
0:11:0,509 --> 0:11:6,949
you meet a person with forty thousand associations,
when you talk there's more response. Less


93
0:11:6,949 --> 0:11:17,459
response with less associations do you understand
that? If a person's very simple he says 'god


94
0:11:17,459 --> 0:11:19,769
wanted it that way that's why it's that way'
 - well that doesn't tell you a damn thing


95
0:11:19,769 --> 0:11:28,89
except that persons reaction. Using reason
does not work unless you equip them with the


96
0:11:28,89 --> 0:11:35,629
tools of reason. Now there are no tools of
reason except specific tools of reason - how


97
0:11:35,629 --> 0:11:43,779
to fly a kite, how to build a wheel - that's
specific reason. But general reasoning, can


98
0:11:43,779 --> 0:11:51,329
not be imparted to people particularly like
things the way they are, meaning if their


99
0:11:51,329 --> 0:11:59,199
reactions are very simple. Now the reason
most people behave badly or poorly is because


100
0:11:59,199 --> 0:12:6,99
they understand simple things. A person once
said to me 'when I ask you a question I never


101
0:12:6,99 --> 0:12:13,999
get an answer, I get a lecture' because there
are no answers. If a guy says 'why does my


102
0:12:13,999 --> 0:12:18,699
brother get angry all the time?' - 'because
he gets angry that's why!' well that doesn't


103
0:12:18,699 --> 0:12:27,85
tell you anything. So you've got to remember
if a persons that simple you don't have the


104
0:12:27,85 --> 0:12:33,49
time to fill in all that detail unless they
say 'I'd like to know step by step, what made


105
0:12:33,49 --> 0:12:40,839
my brother get angry' that's good 'cause it
shows some kind of inquiry, even if they learn


106
0:12:40,839 --> 0:12:48,62
the words and don't know what it means. Now
you have to prove to them that most language


107
0:12:48,62 --> 0:12:57,149
is based upon primitive reactions like if
lightning occurs a primitive might think that


108
0:12:57,149 --> 0:13:7,93
nature is angry, or god is angry, or the god
of lightning is angry whatever they do, if


109
0:13:7,93 --> 0:13:14,309
they're at that level you don't want it. But
if you take native children away from their


110
0:13:14,309 --> 0:13:20,92
parents you can bring them up to the modern
world. No matter how primitive a person is,


111
0:13:20,92 --> 0:13:30,889
you take their babies, you can make them scientific,
chemists anything, but taking an adult is


112
0:13:30,889 --> 0:13:38,199
jamming the whole associative system. If you
bring a primitive person to an airport he


113
0:13:38,199 --> 0:13:44,29
does not look at the airplane in terms of
the wings and the struts and the landing gear


114
0:13:44,29 --> 0:13:50,68
and wonder at all those components, he can't
do that, he can look and grin just like you


115
0:13:50,68 --> 0:13:57,819
look at a tree when you're not into plant
anatomy. You can't see the tree. An anatomist


116
0:13:57,819 --> 0:14:4,369
see's more of the tree, a plant physiologist
than you do, or you may see clearer than he


117
0:14:4,369 --> 0:14:10,319
does, but he knows what to look for. Like
whether it's the rings of the tree that tell


118
0:14:10,319 --> 0:14:17,209
him how old the tree is, or the width of the
rings whether there was a drought or flood


119
0:14:17,209 --> 0:14:24,4
at that time, he has learned to read, or she
has learned to read nature. When I say there's


120
0:14:24,4 --> 0:14:30,709
no such thing as human nature, there's human
reactions to the environment. Some are relevant


121
0:14:30,709 --> 0:14:37,19
some are completely irrelevant, knowing the
difference, the guy says 'why did you beat


122
0:14:37,19 --> 0:14:45,73
the hell out of your kid?' he's way off the
subject, the guy might say 'my kid didn't


123
0:14:45,73 --> 0:14:52,749
listen to me' that isn't the answer, it's
the whole story, you know what i mean? so


124
0:14:52,749 --> 0:14:59,129
when normal people - normal meaning having
simpler reactions, you can't discuss human


125
0:14:59,129 --> 0:15:5,939
nature with them 'cause they have a fixed
notion already of what human nature is - some


126
0:15:5,939 --> 0:15:13,16
inborn propensities or characteristics that
are passed on generation after generation.


127
0:15:13,16 --> 0:17:13,16
And if behavior were fixed we'd still be living
in caves.
