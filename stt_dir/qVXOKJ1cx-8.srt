1
0:0:5,913 --> 0:0:7,823
- Hey, Lindsey.
- Hey.


2
0:0:7,823 --> 0:0:10,891
- What are you up to today?
- Nothing.


3
0:0:10,891 --> 0:0:11,921
Who are you talking to?


4
0:0:11,921 --> 0:0:13,475
No one.


5
0:0:13,475 --> 0:0:16,381
Well tell no one I said nothing.


6
0:0:16,381 --> 0:0:20,101
Okay.


7
0:0:20,101 --> 0:0:21,311
- Hey mom.
- Hi.


8
0:0:21,311 --> 0:0:22,721
Mind if I watch some futbol?


9
0:0:22,721 --> 0:0:25,751
Well at least one of kids
is speaking to me today.


10
0:0:25,751 --> 0:0:27,481
Of course sweetheart, go ahead.


11
0:0:27,481 --> 0:0:30,798
Thank you.


12
0:0:30,798 --> 0:0:31,928
Hey honey, what's up?


13
0:0:31,928 --> 0:0:36,498
Nobody. Nowhere. No nothing.


14
0:0:36,498 --> 0:0:38,505
Hey, Kevin.
What are you up to?


15
0:0:38,505 --> 0:0:40,84
Nothin'.
Just watching football.


16
0:0:40,84 --> 0:0:41,908
Football?


17
0:0:41,908 --> 0:0:43,442
I didn't know
you were into football.


18
0:0:43,442 --> 0:0:44,51
Are you kidding?


19
0:0:44,51 --> 0:0:46,145
It's the greatest sport
in the world.


20
0:0:46,145 --> 0:0:47,642
My man.


21
0:0:47,642 --> 0:0:49,622
I didn't even know
the preseason had started.


22
0:0:49,622 --> 0:0:51,223
The super classic continues.


23
0:0:51,223 --> 0:0:52,708
It's a huge one today,


24
0:0:52,708 --> 0:0:55,54
as it's the Western conference
semifinals game two, tied 2-all.


25
0:0:55,54 --> 0:0:57,762
What's this?
Put it on football.


26
0:0:57,762 --> 0:0:59,579
What do you mean?
This is football.


27
0:0:59,579 --> 0:1:1,963
Boy, my eyes may not be
what they used to be,


28
0:1:1,963 --> 0:1:4,252
but I know the difference
between soccer and football.


29
0:1:4,252 --> 0:1:5,592
Now, change the channel.


30
0:1:5,592 --> 0:1:8,511
This is real football,
<i>futbol.</i>


31
0:1:8,511 --> 0:1:9,984
I don't know
what fruit bowl is,


32
0:1:9,984 --> 0:1:11,829
but in America,
we play football,


33
0:1:11,829 --> 0:1:13,472
the sport I played
in college,


34
0:1:13,472 --> 0:1:14,644
with the pads
and the helmets


35
0:1:14,644 --> 0:1:16,32
and the guys
who knock each other around,


36
0:1:16,32 --> 0:1:17,869
the sport real men play.


37
0:1:17,869 --> 0:1:18,836
Goal!


38
0:1:18,836 --> 0:1:20,812
No fair.
He used his hands.


39
0:1:20,812 --> 0:1:22,787
What kind of sport
doesn't let a man use his has?


40
0:1:22,787 --> 0:1:25,32
No wonder
nobody watches this stuff.


41
0:1:25,32 --> 0:1:27,6
It's the most popular sport
in the world.


42
0:1:27,6 --> 0:1:28,21
That may be,


43
0:1:28,21 --> 0:1:30,51
but it's the least popular
sport in my house.


44
0:1:30,51 --> 0:1:33,863
Now, change the channel.


45
0:1:33,863 --> 0:1:38,247
Change the channel.


46
0:1:38,247 --> 0:1:39,451
You know what?


47
0:1:39,451 --> 0:1:40,855
It's not fruit bowl, okay?


48
0:1:40,855 --> 0:1:43,64
It's <i>futbol.</i>


49
0:1:43,64 --> 0:1:44,267
Look it up in the dictionary.


50
0:1:44,267 --> 0:1:45,905
<i>Futbol,</i> man.


51
0:1:45,905 --> 0:1:47,44

Yes!


58
0:2:2,922 --> 0:2:4,96
Hey, Kevin.


59
0:2:4,96 --> 0:2:6,232
This came for you.


60
0:2:6,232 --> 0:2:10,843
Cool.


61
0:2:10,843 --> 0:2:12,81
What's that?


62
0:2:12,81 --> 0:2:14,19
It's my autographed photo
of Hope Solo.


63
0:2:14,19 --> 0:2:18,661
She is my favorite
football player.


64
0:2:18,661 --> 0:2:20,466
There are no football players
named Hope.


65
0:2:20,466 --> 0:2:23,473
Football players have names
like mean Joe Green,


66
0:2:23,473 --> 0:2:27,648
Refrigerator Perry,
L.T., T.O., A.P., Eli.


67
0:2:27,648 --> 0:2:31,424
What about Chris Hope
on the Tennessee Titans?


68
0:2:31,424 --> 0:2:32,626
Can you frame that for me?


69
0:2:32,626 --> 0:2:34,96
Sure.


70
0:2:34,96 --> 0:2:35,98
Goal!


71
0:2:35,98 --> 0:2:37,136
Goal!


72
0:2:37,136 --> 0:2:48,56
Yes.


73
0:2:48,56 --> 0:2:49,696
Hey, baby.


74
0:2:49,696 --> 0:2:54,872
Hey.


75
0:2:54,872 --> 0:2:55,874
What are you doing?


76
0:2:55,874 --> 0:2:58,281
Uh, taking a quiz.


77
0:2:58,281 --> 0:3:0,418
Who is Tyra Cyrus?


78
0:3:0,418 --> 0:3:1,82
Oh, that's me.


79
0:3:1,82 --> 0:3:3,624
I created a fake profile


80
0:3:3,624 --> 0:3:5,26
and friended
one of Lindsey's friends.


81
0:3:5,26 --> 0:3:6,529
That way,
she would friend me.


82
0:3:6,529 --> 0:3:8,599
This way,
I can see her profile.


83
0:3:8,599 --> 0:3:10,701
So since your daughter
won't speak to you,


84
0:3:10,701 --> 0:3:13,773
you decided the best way to get
to know her was to spy on her?


85
0:3:13,773 --> 0:3:17,28
Hey, that's the way we deal
with North Korea.


86
0:3:17,28 --> 0:3:20,252
And, Nick, it's not spying.
It's friending.


87
0:3:20,252 --> 0:3:22,256
Do what you want,
but I think it's a bad idea.


88
0:3:22,256 --> 0:3:25,862
Did you know that Lindsey
is into saving the dolphins?


89
0:3:25,862 --> 0:3:29,669
And if she had $5,000,
she'd spend it on a Segway.


90
0:3:29,669 --> 0:3:32,5
Why wouldn't she spend it
on saving the dolphins?


91
0:3:32,5 --> 0:3:33,708
Because nobody asked you.


92
0:3:33,708 --> 0:3:34,743
Who is that?


93
0:3:34,743 --> 0:3:36,68
Oh, that's Hope Solo.


94
0:3:36,68 --> 0:3:38,75
Did you know
Kevin was into soccer?


95
0:3:38,75 --> 0:3:40,419
Yes.
I'm his mother.


96
0:3:40,419 --> 0:3:42,756
He's been into soccer
since he was five.


97
0:3:42,756 --> 0:3:43,958
What's the problem?


98
0:3:43,958 --> 0:3:45,961
The problem is,
it's a girls' sport.


99
0:3:45,961 --> 0:3:47,764
Only men I know
who play soccer


100
0:3:47,764 --> 0:3:49,968
are Pele and that dude
who married Posh Spice.


101
0:3:49,968 --> 0:3:53,106
You're worried
about my son's masculinity,


102
0:3:53,106 --> 0:3:55,343
but you know
who Posh Spice is?


103
0:3:55,343 --> 0:3:57,179
That's 'cause I like girls.


104
0:3:57,179 --> 0:3:58,982
I'm not trying
to Bend it like Beckham.


105
0:3:58,982 --> 0:4:1,85
Okay, well,
Kevin loves soccer.


106
0:4:1,85 --> 0:4:2,254
You should give it a chance.


107
0:4:2,254 --> 0:4:3,389
You might like it too.


108
0:4:3,389 --> 0:4:6,59
No way.
I like using my hands too much.


109
0:4:6,59 --> 0:4:7,829
He should give football
a chance.


110
0:4:7,829 --> 0:4:11,234
Well, do what you want.
I know my children.


111
0:4:11,234 --> 0:4:16,409
Lindsey just joined the group
"Megan Fox must be stopped."


112
0:4:16,409 --> 0:4:22,819
Hmph.


113
0:4:22,819 --> 0:4:23,754
Hey, buddy.


114
0:4:23,754 --> 0:4:25,457
Got here
as fast as I could.


115
0:4:25,457 --> 0:4:27,16
Thanks.
You got it?


116
0:4:27,16 --> 0:4:28,162
Bam.


117
0:4:28,162 --> 0:4:30,232
Here it is, <i>Madden 11.</i>


118
0:4:30,232 --> 0:4:31,5
This baby is so new,


119
0:4:31,5 --> 0:4:33,302
John Madden
doesn't even know about it.


120
0:4:33,302 --> 0:4:34,871
Put it over there
by Barkley.


121
0:4:34,871 --> 0:4:37,642
I didn't think
Kevin was into football.


122
0:4:37,642 --> 0:4:39,545
He's not.
That's the problem.


123
0:4:39,545 --> 0:4:40,58
He's into soccer.


124
0:4:40,58 --> 0:4:43,16
And his favorite athlete's
a girl.


125
0:4:43,16 --> 0:4:45,217
I don't want to have
to buy him a sports bra.


126
0:4:45,217 --> 0:4:46,718
Mm, ouch.


127
0:4:46,718 --> 0:4:49,621
And the final score
is girl power 1,


128
0:4:49,621 --> 0:4:51,689
father figure nothing.


129
0:4:51,689 --> 0:4:52,79
All that's gonna change


130
0:4:52,79 --> 0:4:54,958
after we play a few games
of <i>Madden.</i>


131
0:4:54,958 --> 0:4:56,159
Unless he plays it


132
0:4:56,159 --> 0:5:0,362
and decides he wants
to be a cheerleader.


133
0:5:0,362 --> 0:5:8,505
It happens.


134
0:5:8,505 --> 0:5:9,772
Uh.


135
0:5:9,772 --> 0:5:13,909
Who are you, strange boy
sending my daughter gifts?


136
0:5:13,909 --> 0:5:22,216
I'm gonna have
to friend you too.


137
0:5:22,216 --> 0:5:23,917
Suzanne,
I have an emergency.


138
0:5:23,917 --> 0:5:25,185
What is it?


139
0:5:25,185 --> 0:5:27,219
You know that guy
I've been dating, Jonathan?


140
0:5:27,219 --> 0:5:28,62
Yeah.


141
0:5:28,62 --> 0:5:29,621
What did he do?


142
0:5:29,621 --> 0:5:30,655
Nothing.


143
0:5:30,655 --> 0:5:31,956
That's the problem.


144
0:5:31,956 --> 0:5:34,392
Every time I call him,
he doesn't answer.


145
0:5:34,392 --> 0:5:36,26
And when I ask
why he didn't call me back,


146
0:5:36,26 --> 0:5:37,962
he acts like
he never got the message.


147
0:5:37,962 --> 0:5:40,73
So last night,
I tried one last time


148
0:5:40,73 --> 0:5:41,998
to get his attention


149
0:5:41,998 --> 0:5:44,934
by sending him
naked pictures of me.


150
0:5:44,934 --> 0:5:47,569
No, you didn't.


151
0:5:47,569 --> 0:5:50,104
Yes, I did.


152
0:5:50,104 --> 0:5:53,306
And he didn't respond.


153
0:5:53,306 --> 0:5:55,4
So tomorrow I'm gonna
break up with him.


154
0:5:55,4 --> 0:5:56,541
Okay, what's the problem?


155
0:5:56,541 --> 0:5:58,409
You've broken up
with tons of guys.


156
0:5:58,409 --> 0:6:0,11
The problem is,
I want to make sure


157
0:6:0,11 --> 0:6:2,378
those pictures are deleted
off his phone first,


158
0:6:2,378 --> 0:6:4,18
because the last thing
you want to do


159
0:6:4,18 --> 0:6:6,783
is break up with a guy
who has naked pictures of you.


160
0:6:6,783 --> 0:6:10,619
I mean, you've seen
what happened to John Edwards.


161
0:6:10,619 --> 0:6:12,53
Okay, what do you
need me to do?


162
0:6:12,53 --> 0:6:13,42
Okay.


163
0:6:13,42 --> 0:6:15,956
Tomorrow night, I'm going out
to dinner with him,


164
0:6:15,956 --> 0:6:18,458
and at 9:00,
I need you to call me.


165
0:6:18,458 --> 0:6:21,461
And when I answer, I'm gonna act
like my phone went dead


166
0:6:21,461 --> 0:6:23,96
and ask to borrow his phone.


167
0:6:23,96 --> 0:6:25,165
And then I'm gonna go
into his phone


168
0:6:25,165 --> 0:6:27,33
and delete the pictures
I sent him.


169
0:6:27,33 --> 0:6:30,37
Why don't you just ask him
to delete them?


170
0:6:30,37 --> 0:6:34,41
Like a man would voluntarily
delete naked pictures of me.


171
0:6:34,41 --> 0:6:36,744
I don't think so.


172
0:6:36,744 --> 0:6:38,245
That's funny, though.


173
0:6:38,245 --> 0:6:46,319
Right.


174
0:6:46,319 --> 0:6:50,489
Click


175
0:6:50,489 --> 0:6:54,993
click


176
0:6:54,993 --> 0:6:56,795
click


177
0:6:56,795 --> 0:6:58,563
What are you doing
with my hat?


178
0:6:58,563 --> 0:7:1,666
I'm trying to take
a better picture for my profile.


179
0:7:1,666 --> 0:7:3,234
Well, if you wanted
a better picture,


180
0:7:3,234 --> 0:7:6,404
you might as well wear
a paper bag over your head.


181
0:7:6,404 --> 0:7:8,237
- Give me my hat.
- No.


182
0:7:8,237 --> 0:7:9,537
- Give me my hat!
- No!


183
0:7:9,537 --> 0:7:10,738
What's wrong with you?


184
0:7:10,738 --> 0:7:11,806
Hey, hey, hey, you two.


185
0:7:11,806 --> 0:7:13,24
What is going on?


186
0:7:13,24 --> 0:7:15,608
Nothing.


187
0:7:15,608 --> 0:7:16,776
Whoa.


188
0:7:16,776 --> 0:7:18,111
What's wrong with Lindsey?


189
0:7:18,111 --> 0:7:19,779
I don't know,


190
0:7:19,779 --> 0:7:23,482
but I am about
to find out.


191
0:7:23,482 --> 0:7:24,75
Hey, Kevin,


192
0:7:24,75 --> 0:7:26,186
you want to test out
a early version


193
0:7:26,186 --> 0:7:27,154
of the new <i>Madden</i> game?


194
0:7:27,154 --> 0:7:29,254
<i>Madden?</i>
What's that?


195
0:7:29,254 --> 0:7:30,487
It's a football game,


196
0:7:30,487 --> 0:7:32,122
NFL football.


197
0:7:32,122 --> 0:7:33,523
Sure, I guess.


198
0:7:33,523 --> 0:7:37,694
All right, cool.


199
0:7:37,694 --> 0:7:39,23
See, it's working.


200
0:7:39,23 --> 0:7:40,931
What's the latest
on Lindsey?


201
0:7:40,931 --> 0:7:44,9
She just updated
her profile pic,


202
0:7:44,9 --> 0:7:46,666
and Jenny likes it.


203
0:7:46,666 --> 0:7:48,835
It's working.


204
0:7:48,835 --> 0:7:50,736
"Me too."


205
0:7:50,736 --> 0:7:52,904
Smiley face,


206
0:7:52,904 --> 0:8:2,46
send.


207
0:8:2,46 --> 0:8:3,213
All right, Kevin,


208
0:8:3,213 --> 0:8:4,415
I'll be the Seahawks.


209
0:8:4,415 --> 0:8:5,682
You should be the Vikings.


210
0:8:5,682 --> 0:8:8,383
They have Adrian Peterson,
the fastest-rated player.


211
0:8:8,383 --> 0:8:10,351
Who's got the best kicker?


212
0:8:10,351 --> 0:8:16,656
Kevin, no one picks a team
based on the kicker.


213
0:8:16,656 --> 0:8:18,991
The Lions' kicker looks good.
I'll be them.


214
0:8:18,991 --> 0:8:20,359
No, no.


215
0:8:20,359 --> 0:8:22,94
You cannot be the Lions.


216
0:8:22,94 --> 0:8:23,562
Kevin, the Lions
are the only team


217
0:8:23,562 --> 0:8:25,964
in the history of the NFL
to go 0 and 16.


218
0:8:25,964 --> 0:8:27,798
I don't even know
why they wear uniforms.


219
0:8:27,798 --> 0:8:29,666
They should just play
in jean shorts.


220
0:8:29,666 --> 0:8:32,168
I don't care.
I want to be the Lions.


221
0:8:32,168 --> 0:8:33,936
Fine, you can be the Lions.


222
0:8:33,936 --> 0:8:35,3
But don't come crying to me


223
0:8:35,3 --> 0:8:36,404
when you don't reach
the end zone.


224
0:8:36,404 --> 0:8:39,574
What's an end zone?


225
0:8:39,574 --> 0:8:42,276
Okay, this is gonna be
a long game.


226
0:8:42,276 --> 0:8:48,849
To return this kick.


227
0:8:48,849 --> 0:8:50,619
McGill still going.


228
0:8:50,619 --> 0:8:51,587
Yes.


229
0:8:51,587 --> 0:8:53,89
First down.


230
0:8:53,89 --> 0:8:54,457
Not bad, Kev.


231
0:8:54,457 --> 0:8:56,425
You made it
down to the 40-yard line.


232
0:8:56,425 --> 0:9:1,195
I think you might be better
than the actual Detroit Lions.


233
0:9:1,195 --> 0:9:2,496
Wait. Wait.
What are you doing?


234
0:9:2,496 --> 0:9:4,197
You can't line up
for a field goal.


235
0:9:4,197 --> 0:9:5,198
Why not?


236
0:9:5,198 --> 0:9:6,499
Because it's first down,


237
0:9:6,499 --> 0:9:7,733
and you're
on the 40-yard line.


238
0:9:7,733 --> 0:9:9,268
You want to score
a touchdown.


239
0:9:9,268 --> 0:9:11,604
I like field goals.


240
0:9:11,604 --> 0:9:13,472
And it's good.


241
0:9:13,472 --> 0:9:16,6
Yes!
Field goal.


242
0:9:16,6 --> 0:9:18,75
58 yards
straight down the middle.


243
0:9:18,75 --> 0:9:22,212
This kid can kick.


244
0:9:22,212 --> 0:9:23,78
Pick up...
Pick up the thing.


245
0:9:23,78 --> 0:9:24,781
Let's go.


246
0:9:24,781 --> 0:9:25,782
I'll whup you.


247
0:9:25,782 --> 0:9:28,318
Let's go.


248
0:9:28,318 --> 0:9:29,587
He's down to the 10,


249
0:9:29,587 --> 0:9:32,356
the 5, and fumble!


250
0:9:32,356 --> 0:9:35,625
Oh! And the Lions take over
at the Seahawks' 1-yard line.


251
0:9:35,625 --> 0:9:37,226
Ho, baby.


252
0:9:37,226 --> 0:9:39,161
And in a surprise move,


253
0:9:39,161 --> 0:9:42,33
the kicking team
trots back out onto the field.


254
0:9:42,33 --> 0:9:43,831
Wait.
What are you doing?


255
0:9:43,831 --> 0:9:45,199
You're on the 1-yard line.


256
0:9:45,199 --> 0:9:46,801
You have one yard to go
for a touchdown.


257
0:9:46,801 --> 0:9:49,336
I like field goals.


258
0:9:49,336 --> 0:9:51,438
Yes! Field goal!


259
0:9:51,438 --> 0:9:55,142
And our score:
Lions 6, Seahawks 0.


260
0:9:55,142 --> 0:9:56,743
Pick it up.
Come on.


261
0:9:56,743 --> 0:9:57,744
I'm hungry.


262
0:9:57,744 --> 0:9:59,346
Come on.
Pick it up. Let's go.


263
0:9:59,346 --> 0:10:0,413
Play.


264
0:10:0,413 --> 0:10:2,483
Field goal.


265
0:10:2,483 --> 0:10:4,385
Field goal.


266
0:10:4,385 --> 0:10:5,887
Field goal.


267
0:10:5,887 --> 0:10:8,21
Field goal!


268
0:10:8,21 --> 0:10:10,49
Field goal.


269
0:10:10,49 --> 0:10:12,25
Field goal.


270
0:10:12,25 --> 0:10:14,393
Field goal!


271
0:10:14,393 --> 0:10:16,27
Yes!


272
0:10:16,27 --> 0:10:17,395
I win.


273
0:10:17,395 --> 0:10:18,663
Turn out the lights, folks.


274
0:10:18,663 --> 0:10:21,32
This party is over.


275
0:10:21,32 --> 0:10:24,0
I can't believe you won
on all field goals.


276
0:10:24,0 --> 0:10:25,735
Hey, at least you were right
about one thing:


277
0:10:25,735 --> 0:10:27,769
He never did make it
to the end zone.


278
0:10:27,769 --> 0:10:30,7
Touchdowns are stupid.


279
0:10:30,7 --> 0:10:31,671
Why would you let everybody
hit you


280
0:10:31,671 --> 0:10:33,906
when you can just kick it
right over their heads?


281
0:10:33,906 --> 0:10:35,34
He does have a point.


282
0:10:35,34 --> 0:10:39,177
Plus, lots of these kickers
were former soccer players,


283
0:10:39,177 --> 0:10:40,411
and everybody knows


284
0:10:40,411 --> 0:10:42,58
soccer players are better
than football players.


285
0:10:42,58 --> 0:10:43,914
Excuse me?


286
0:10:43,914 --> 0:10:45,115
I know
a lot of soccer players


287
0:10:45,115 --> 0:10:46,382
who could easily
play football.


288
0:10:46,382 --> 0:10:47,884
I don't know
any football players


289
0:10:47,884 --> 0:10:49,352
who could play soccer.


290
0:10:49,352 --> 0:10:51,19
And you are excused.


291
0:10:51,19 --> 0:10:52,788
I was a football player,


292
0:10:52,788 --> 0:10:55,156
and I could beat you in soccer
any day of the week.


293
0:10:55,156 --> 0:10:57,91
How about tomorrow?
We can have a shoot-out.


294
0:10:57,91 --> 0:10:58,625
Fine.


295
0:10:58,625 --> 0:11:3,229
Fine.


296
0:11:3,229 --> 0:11:6,799
What's a shoot-out?


297
0:11:6,799 --> 0:11:14,534
What's a shoot-out, man?


298
0:11:14,534 --> 0:11:16,122
Hi Lindsey


299
0:11:16,122 --> 0:11:18,323
"If you're still
thinking about it,


300
0:11:18,323 --> 0:11:20,258
I say go for it."


301
0:11:20,258 --> 0:11:24,962
Go for what?


302
0:11:24,962 --> 0:11:26,33
Hey, Lindsey.


303
0:11:26,33 --> 0:11:27,297
Hey.


304
0:11:27,297 --> 0:11:28,899
Been thinking
about anything?


305
0:11:28,899 --> 0:11:30,734
Not really.


306
0:11:30,734 --> 0:11:32,468
Going for something?


307
0:11:32,468 --> 0:11:33,436
Huh?


308
0:11:33,436 --> 0:11:38,906
No.


309
0:11:38,906 --> 0:11:40,307
Hey, Gigi.


310
0:11:40,307 --> 0:11:42,676
You're not gonna
believe this.


311
0:11:42,676 --> 0:11:43,844
What now?


312
0:11:43,844 --> 0:11:47,179
That man deleted
naked pictures of me.


313
0:11:47,179 --> 0:11:48,513
Voluntarily?


314
0:11:48,513 --> 0:11:49,681
Yes!


315
0:11:49,681 --> 0:11:51,648
Last night worked perfectly
when you called me.


316
0:11:51,648 --> 0:11:53,15
But when I borrowed
Jonathan's phone


317
0:11:53,15 --> 0:11:55,552
and went outside to delete
the pictures I sent him,


318
0:11:55,552 --> 0:11:56,887
they weren't even there.


319
0:11:56,887 --> 0:11:58,355
That's great.


320
0:11:58,355 --> 0:11:59,589
No, it's not.


321
0:11:59,589 --> 0:12:1,49
I don't send those pictures
to just anybody.


322
0:12:1,49 --> 0:12:3,225
How dare he delete them?


323
0:12:3,225 --> 0:12:4,66
Wait.


324
0:12:4,66 --> 0:12:7,96
I thought the whole point
of this scheme


325
0:12:7,96 --> 0:12:9,598
was to get your pictures
off of his phone.


326
0:12:9,598 --> 0:12:11,6
Yes, it's okay
if I delete them,


327
0:12:11,6 --> 0:12:12,834
but he shouldn't.


328
0:12:12,834 --> 0:12:15,236
He should be sending them
all over the Internet.


329
0:12:15,236 --> 0:12:18,639
I should be on the front page
of Media Takeout.


330
0:12:18,639 --> 0:12:20,541
I see.


331
0:12:20,541 --> 0:12:22,475
Gigi, what's up
with the gear?


332
0:12:22,475 --> 0:12:24,444
Oh, I just came
from boxing class.


333
0:12:24,444 --> 0:12:26,345
I'm trying to work off
my aggression


334
0:12:26,345 --> 0:12:27,68
before I see him
again tonight,


335
0:12:27,68 --> 0:12:29,682
because this time,


336
0:12:29,682 --> 0:12:32,451
I'm gonna make him beg me
to send him pictures,


337
0:12:32,451 --> 0:12:37,222
and then
I'm gonna dump him.


338
0:12:37,222 --> 0:12:38,557
I see.


339
0:12:38,557 --> 0:12:40,592
Well, that'll teach him


340
0:12:40,592 --> 0:12:42,66
to delete
inappropriate pictures of you


341
0:12:42,66 --> 0:12:44,861
that you wanted
to delete anyway.


342
0:12:44,861 --> 0:12:48,431
I knew you'd understand.


343
0:12:48,431 --> 0:12:49,765
Did you drive like that?


344
0:12:49,765 --> 0:12:51,233
Can you help me?


345
0:12:51,233 --> 0:12:52,468
- Gigi.
- What?


346
0:12:52,468 --> 0:12:54,7
There's no
peripheral vision.


347
0:12:54,7 --> 0:12:55,438
You can't even see.


348
0:12:55,438 --> 0:12:57,6
Well, I didn't have to see
all that much.


349
0:12:57,6 --> 0:12:58,841
It was just a straight line,
then I had to turn,


350
0:12:58,841 --> 0:13:0,175
and then
another straight line.


351
0:13:0,175 --> 0:13:3,511
Then I did a u-turn.


352
0:13:3,511 --> 0:13:4,946
Agh!


353
0:13:4,946 --> 0:13:6,314
Bring it in.


354
0:13:6,314 --> 0:13:7,882
What makes the grass grow?


355
0:13:7,882 --> 0:13:9,316
Chalk makes the grass grow.


356
0:13:9,316 --> 0:13:10,384
Dah.


357
0:13:10,384 --> 0:13:11,852
Dah.


358
0:13:11,852 --> 0:13:13,52
Dah.


359
0:13:13,52 --> 0:13:14,87
Dah.


360
0:13:14,87 --> 0:13:22,326
Hut, hut, hut.


361
0:13:22,326 --> 0:13:24,461
Hah!


362
0:13:24,461 --> 0:13:25,695
Huh! Hah!


363
0:13:25,695 --> 0:13:26,696
What are you doing?


364
0:13:26,696 --> 0:13:29,432
Defensive football drills.


365
0:13:29,432 --> 0:13:32,135
Soccer players wouldn't know
anything about it.


366
0:13:32,135 --> 0:13:33,769
What are you doing here?


367
0:13:33,769 --> 0:13:35,604
Somebody had to bring
the snacks.


368
0:13:35,604 --> 0:13:37,673
Plus, I need to be here
to make sure everything is fair


369
0:13:37,673 --> 0:13:39,675
and that nobody has anything
to complain about,


370
0:13:39,675 --> 0:13:41,143
no matter what happens.


371
0:13:41,143 --> 0:13:48,316
Orange slice?


372
0:13:48,316 --> 0:13:49,316
You ready?


373
0:13:49,316 --> 0:13:51,217
I was born ready.


374
0:13:51,217 --> 0:13:52,285
Goal!


375
0:13:52,285 --> 0:13:54,2
Hey, hey, hey, hey.


376
0:13:54,2 --> 0:13:56,455
I wasn't ready.


377
0:13:56,455 --> 0:13:57,688
Now I'm ready.


378
0:13:57,688 --> 0:13:58,722
Oh!


379
0:13:58,722 --> 0:14:0,557
Goal!


380
0:14:0,557 --> 0:14:1,559
You know what?


381
0:14:1,559 --> 0:14:2,894
You'd better enjoy that one,


382
0:14:2,894 --> 0:14:6,797
'cause that's gonna be
the last one you get.


383
0:14:6,797 --> 0:14:8,298
Oh!


384
0:14:8,298 --> 0:14:9,299
Oh!


385
0:14:9,299 --> 0:14:13,936
Oh. Ahh!


386
0:14:13,936 --> 0:14:15,4
Look, Gigi.


387
0:14:15,4 --> 0:14:17,172
Lindsey has 69 friends
on here.


388
0:14:17,172 --> 0:14:18,707
Wow.
Bang!


389
0:14:18,707 --> 0:14:20,909
Look, she's taken a quiz:


390
0:14:20,909 --> 0:14:24,979
"Who is your
biracial boyfriend?"


391
0:14:24,979 --> 0:14:26,614
And she's joined
another group.


392
0:14:26,614 --> 0:14:30,749
"Did you know Megan Fox
has club thumbs?"


393
0:14:30,749 --> 0:14:33,84
What is up with her
and Megan Fox?


394
0:14:33,84 --> 0:14:35,986
Oh, look,
she's been poked 67 times.


395
0:14:35,986 --> 0:14:39,322
And Jeremy commented
on her post,


396
0:14:39,322 --> 0:14:42,991
"am thinking about going
all the way this week."


397
0:14:42,991 --> 0:14:46,93
What do you think that means?


398
0:14:46,93 --> 0:14:48,864
I think it means
what it's always meant.


399
0:14:48,864 --> 0:14:52,535
Sex? No way.


400
0:14:52,535 --> 0:14:53,87
Mm-mm, not my Lindsey.


401
0:14:53,87 --> 0:14:56,773
That could mean
any number of things.


402
0:14:56,773 --> 0:14:58,208
What is going on
out there?


403
0:14:58,208 --> 0:14:59,509
Soccer shoot-out.


404
0:14:59,509 --> 0:15:1,477
Oh, soccer players.


405
0:15:1,477 --> 0:15:3,312
So athletic.


406
0:15:3,312 --> 0:15:6,48
What do you mean, it could mean
any number of things?


407
0:15:6,48 --> 0:15:7,415
I don't know.


408
0:15:7,415 --> 0:15:10,118
Well, you need to have
a talk with your daughter.


409
0:15:10,118 --> 0:15:11,219
Bang!


410
0:15:11,219 --> 0:15:13,21
I don't believe this.


411
0:15:13,21 --> 0:15:14,389
And while
you're on the subject,


412
0:15:14,389 --> 0:15:16,24
make sure you tell her
never to send a guy


413
0:15:16,24 --> 0:15:27,135
naked cell phone pictures.


414
0:15:27,135 --> 0:15:28,169
How'd the game go?


415
0:15:28,169 --> 0:15:29,137
It was great.


416
0:15:29,137 --> 0:15:30,805
I beat him 10 to 1.


417
0:15:30,805 --> 0:15:32,34
He did better
than I thought, though.


418
0:15:32,34 --> 0:15:34,843
Well, why don't you
go upstairs and get cleaned up?


419
0:15:34,843 --> 0:15:36,879
I didn't even
break a sweat.


420
0:15:36,879 --> 0:15:38,847
Go.


421
0:15:38,847 --> 0:15:42,5
Fine.


422
0:15:42,5 --> 0:15:45,454
Nick, I need to talk to you
about Lindsey.


423
0:15:45,454 --> 0:15:53,293
Can we do it
sitting down?


424
0:15:53,293 --> 0:15:58,3
Okay, so Lindsey
is thinking about having sex.


425
0:15:58,3 --> 0:15:59,865
I saw it on her web page.


426
0:15:59,865 --> 0:16:3,34
See? I told you spying on her
would lead to trouble.


427
0:16:3,34 --> 0:16:6,103
Spying on who?


428
0:16:6,103 --> 0:16:8,605
Lindsey, would you
have a seat, please?


429
0:16:8,605 --> 0:16:10,607
Um, okay.


430
0:16:10,607 --> 0:16:12,174
Maybe I should leave
you two alone.


431
0:16:12,174 --> 0:16:13,575
No, Nick, you stay.


432
0:16:13,575 --> 0:16:15,244
I need your support
on this.


433
0:16:15,244 --> 0:16:17,245
Fine.


434
0:16:17,245 --> 0:16:19,47
What's this about?


435
0:16:19,47 --> 0:16:20,15
Your mother--


436
0:16:20,15 --> 0:16:21,45
are you thinking
about having sex?


437
0:16:21,45 --> 0:16:24,18
What? Why would you ask me
something like that?


438
0:16:24,18 --> 0:16:25,186
I saw it on your web page


439
0:16:25,186 --> 0:16:27,154
that you're thinking
about going all the way.


440
0:16:27,154 --> 0:16:29,523
You saw my web page?
How?


441
0:16:29,523 --> 0:16:31,991
I created a fake profile
so I could see it.


442
0:16:31,991 --> 0:16:33,993
Lindsey,
why didn't you tell me


443
0:16:33,993 --> 0:16:36,61
that you were thinking
about having sex?


444
0:16:36,61 --> 0:16:37,362
I thought I could trust you


445
0:16:37,362 --> 0:16:40,532
to come to me
with things like this.


446
0:16:40,532 --> 0:16:41,666
Wait a minute.


447
0:16:41,666 --> 0:16:43,601
You created a fake profile
to spy on me,


448
0:16:43,601 --> 0:16:45,2
and you're talking
about trust?


449
0:16:45,2 --> 0:16:47,203
I was just trying
to find out more about you,


450
0:16:47,203 --> 0:16:50,673
because it seems like you never
want to talk to me anymore.


451
0:16:50,673 --> 0:16:52,575
Well, that's not the way
you go about it, mom,


452
0:16:52,575 --> 0:16:54,61
and I'm not thinking
about having sex.


453
0:16:54,61 --> 0:16:56,278
Then why does it say
on your profile


454
0:16:56,278 --> 0:16:58,614
that you're thinking
about going all the way?


455
0:16:58,614 --> 0:17:0,383
I was talking
about my hair.


456
0:17:0,383 --> 0:17:2,91
I hated my last haircut,


457
0:17:2,91 --> 0:17:5,114
and I was thinking
about cutting it really short.


458
0:17:5,114 --> 0:17:6,573
Really?


459
0:17:6,573 --> 0:17:7,674
Really.


460
0:17:7,674 --> 0:17:12,346
How could you spy on me
like that?


461
0:17:12,346 --> 0:17:13,414
Sweetheart,


462
0:17:13,414 --> 0:17:15,683
I'm sorry
for spying on you.


463
0:17:15,683 --> 0:17:18,253
It was wrong and stupid.


464
0:17:18,253 --> 0:17:20,355
Will you forgive me?


465
0:17:20,355 --> 0:17:22,57
Yes.


466
0:17:22,57 --> 0:17:24,693
Which one of my friends
are you?


467
0:17:24,693 --> 0:17:26,295
Tyra Cyrus.


468
0:17:26,295 --> 0:17:28,23
Tyra Cyrus?


469
0:17:28,23 --> 0:17:35,503
Really?


470
0:17:35,503 --> 0:17:36,837
That was nice.


471
0:17:36,837 --> 0:17:38,638
No thanks to you.


472
0:17:38,638 --> 0:17:39,973
You barely said anything.


473
0:17:39,973 --> 0:17:50,833
Thanks for backing me up.


474
0:17:50,833 --> 0:17:53,935
I never knew soccer
could be so hard, Charles.


475
0:17:53,935 --> 0:17:55,36
All I wanted to do


476
0:17:55,36 --> 0:17:56,87
was prove to the little guy
I still had it,


477
0:17:56,87 --> 0:17:58,904
like when you played
with Scottie Pippen,


478
0:17:58,904 --> 0:18:1,973
although we did make
a little connection.


479
0:18:1,973 --> 0:18:4,741
I spent more time with him
in the last two days


480
0:18:4,741 --> 0:18:10,277
than I did
the whole last month.


481
0:18:10,277 --> 0:18:11,711
How are you feeling?


482
0:18:11,711 --> 0:18:13,713
Like I just played
a double-overtime game


483
0:18:13,713 --> 0:18:17,281
in the Super Bowl and lost.


484
0:18:17,281 --> 0:18:20,216
Oh, my big, strong man.


485
0:18:20,216 --> 0:18:21,384
Ow.
Ooh.


486
0:18:21,384 --> 0:18:24,42
I'm sure you probably
let him win.


487
0:18:24,42 --> 0:18:27,858
Yeah, kind of did.


488
0:18:27,858 --> 0:18:30,195
Thanks, baby.


489
0:18:30,195 --> 0:18:32,999
Kevin loves soccer.
That's not gonna change.


490
0:18:32,999 --> 0:18:36,935
You know what else
is never gonna change?


491
0:18:36,935 --> 0:18:39,805
How much I love you.


492
0:18:39,805 --> 0:18:41,6
Come on,
let's go inside,


493
0:18:41,6 --> 0:18:43,175
and I'll rub
your tired old legs.


494
0:18:43,175 --> 0:18:52,452
Oh, let's go.


495
0:18:52,452 --> 0:18:56,461
Any chance
we could stay out here?


496
0:18:56,461 --> 0:18:57,997
Oh. Ow.


497
0:18:57,997 --> 0:18:58,965
Ooh.


498
0:18:58,965 --> 0:18:59,966
Oh, my goodness.


499
0:18:59,966 --> 0:19:0,967
I know.


500
0:19:0,967 --> 0:19:1,901
Okay.
Okay.


501
0:19:1,901 --> 0:19:9,709
Whoo, help me.


502
0:19:9,709 --> 0:19:10,877
Morning.


503
0:19:10,877 --> 0:19:12,914
Morning.


504
0:19:12,914 --> 0:19:15,249
Oh, did you break up
with Jonathan yet?


505
0:19:15,249 --> 0:19:17,619
Actually, no.


506
0:19:17,619 --> 0:19:20,654
Get this: Turns out
I always had his number wrong,


507
0:19:20,654 --> 0:19:23,22
which explains why he never
returned my calls


508
0:19:23,22 --> 0:19:25,29
and why my pictures
weren't on his phone.


509
0:19:25,29 --> 0:19:26,391
He never got them.


510
0:19:26,391 --> 0:19:29,26
So who's been getting
your pictures?


511
0:19:29,26 --> 0:19:29,963
I don't know.


512
0:19:29,963 --> 0:19:31,365
I texted the person
this morning,


513
0:19:31,365 --> 0:19:34,902
but I haven't heard back yet.


514
0:19:34,902 --> 0:19:38,904
Oh, the mystery person.


515
0:19:38,904 --> 0:19:41,73
"Hi, my name is Carl."


516
0:19:41,73 --> 0:19:43,508
Oh, no, it's a guy.


517
0:19:43,508 --> 0:19:45,277
"Thanks for the pics.


518
0:19:45,277 --> 0:19:47,412
"Let's get together soon.


519
0:19:47,412 --> 0:19:49,847
Here's a picture of me."


520
0:19:49,847 --> 0:19:52,15
Eww!


521
0:19:52,15 --> 0:19:55,787
Doesn't anybody send pictures
of their faces anymore?


522
0:19:55,787 --> 0:19:57,288
You didn't.


523
0:19:57,288 --> 0:20:4,996
Oh, damn, now I got to get
a new phone.


524
0:20:4,996 --> 0:20:7,264
All right, with seconds
left on the clock,


525
0:20:7,264 --> 0:20:8,599
double-k-p sets up.


526
0:20:8,599 --> 0:20:9,733
He shoots.


527
0:20:9,733 --> 0:20:13,27
Goal!
And the crowd goes wild!


528
0:20:13,27 --> 0:20:17,706
Hey, man.
Hey.


529
0:20:17,706 --> 0:20:20,775
I got something for you.


530
0:20:20,775 --> 0:20:22,11
Who's this?


531
0:20:22,11 --> 0:20:23,378
Pete Gogolak,


532
0:20:23,378 --> 0:20:24,613
placekicker for the Giants


533
0:20:24,613 --> 0:20:25,914
and was also responsible


534
0:20:25,914 --> 0:20:28,183
for bringing soccer-style
kicking to the NFL.


535
0:20:28,183 --> 0:20:30,919
Whoa. Thanks, dad.
I love it.


536
0:20:30,919 --> 0:20:32,353
Turns out
he was also the Giants'


537
0:20:32,353 --> 0:20:33,887
all-time leading scorer.


538
0:20:33,887 --> 0:20:34,855
A former soccer player.


539
0:20:34,855 --> 0:20:36,255
Who'd have guessed it, huh?


540
0:20:36,255 --> 0:20:37,723
Yeah.


541
0:20:37,723 --> 0:20:39,891
I guess
I underestimated you.


542
0:20:39,891 --> 0:20:42,727
Hey, I'm ten.
It happens.


543
0:20:42,727 --> 0:20:44,895
So she's your favorite
soccer player, huh?


544
0:20:44,895 --> 0:20:47,529
Yup, but that's not
why I wanted the picture.


545
0:20:47,529 --> 0:20:49,63
Huh?


546
0:20:49,63 --> 0:20:52,363
No, it's 'cause she's hot.


547
