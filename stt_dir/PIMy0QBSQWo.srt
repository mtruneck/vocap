1
0:0:1,958 --> 0:0:4,649
What is a Resource Based Economy?


2
0:0:4,649 --> 0:0:6,976
I'm sure you've all heard about it.


3
0:0:6,976 --> 0:0:11,784
But a Resource Based Economy is entirely different than anything


4
0:0:11,784 --> 0:0:15,169
that has ever existed in the past.


5
0:0:15,169 --> 0:0:20,115
Most decisions were made by kings, politicians, statesmen


6
0:0:20,115 --> 0:0:24,199
but nothing based upon resources.


7
0:0:24,199 --> 0:0:28,8
To better understand the meaning of a Resource Based Economy


8
0:0:28,8 --> 0:0:31,199
picture an island somewhere in the South Pacific.


9
0:0:31,199 --> 0:0:34,878
And you really want to know how many people


10
0:0:34,878 --> 0:0:38,272
can that island support and to what degree


11
0:0:38,272 --> 0:0:42,2
can the extravagance of the island be maintained.


12
0:0:42,2 --> 0:0:44,46
First, you have to know how much wood there is


13
0:0:44,46 --> 0:0:47,759
how much water, how much arable land.


14
0:0:47,759 --> 0:0:51,842
Once you do a survey of the resources of that island


15
0:0:51,842 --> 0:0:55,201
that can best be the method for determining


16
0:0:55,201 --> 0:0:57,86
how many people it will support.


17
0:0:57,86 --> 0:1:2,587
If the materials do not exist, you can only design a culture


18
0:1:2,587 --> 0:1:6,4
based upon the materials that do exist.


19
0:1:6,4 --> 0:1:10,734
You can only grow food based upon the arable land area


20
0:1:10,734 --> 0:1:13,15
and the water surrounding the island


21
0:1:13,15 --> 0:1:17,322
the fish, crustaceans, all the other things.


22
0:1:17,322 --> 0:1:20,64
And if you have an agronomist on your island


23
0:1:20,64 --> 0:1:23,879
or a series of them, they can advise you


24
0:1:23,879 --> 0:1:27,82
as what is best to grow in that tropical region.


25
0:1:27,82 --> 0:1:31,43
So you really need technical competence


26
0:1:31,43 --> 0:1:36,75
in order to arrive at decisions that make sense.


27
0:1:36,75 --> 0:1:38,9
You cannot arrive at decisions


28
0:1:38,9 --> 0:1:41,78
that make sense by consensus.


29
0:1:41,78 --> 0:1:44,0
By asking people what they want.


30
0:1:44,0 --> 0:1:46,999
You have to find out what the island has to offer.


31
0:1:46,999 --> 0:1:50,136
And that's what you can determine the future by.


32
0:1:50,136 --> 0:1:53,16
All other systems will fail.


33
0:1:53,16 --> 0:1:56,657
Politicians have opinions about everything


34
0:1:56,657 --> 0:2:0,13
and information about nothing in particular.


35
0:2:0,13 --> 0:2:2,38
Therefore you understand


36
0:2:2,38 --> 0:2:6,669
that the decisions are not made by the majority of people.


37
0:2:6,669 --> 0:2:11,479
They are made by the majority of people that have technical competence


38
0:2:11,479 --> 0:2:16,12
that have information in the areas you wish to excel in


39
0:2:16,12 --> 0:2:20,985
and methods of scientific scales of performance.


40
0:2:20,985 --> 0:2:25,721
If you have a million sincere people that have no technical competence


41
0:2:25,721 --> 0:2:28,931
I can assure you, nothing can be accomplished.


42
0:2:28,931 --> 0:2:31,259
So you have to ask the questions:


43
0:2:31,259 --> 0:2:36,45
Can we build a society of sustainability?


44
0:2:36,45 --> 0:2:40,379
If you have no information as to the availability of resources


45
0:2:40,379 --> 0:2:43,319
you cannot undertake such a project.


46
0:2:43,319 --> 0:2:45,902
Suppose you have a shortage of resources.


47
0:2:45,902 --> 0:2:48,559
That's the function of research labs:


48
0:2:48,559 --> 0:2:51,159
to make alternative materials


49
0:2:51,159 --> 0:2:54,669
that will substitute for lack of materials.


50
0:2:54,669 --> 0:2:59,29
Technicians do not tell you what to do or how to live.


51
0:2:59,29 --> 0:3:3,372
They merely carry out the function of designing elevators


52
0:3:3,372 --> 0:3:7,779
transportation units, bridges, housing systems.


53
0:3:7,779 --> 0:3:12,999
They do not tell people what to do, what to think or how to live.


54
0:3:12,999 --> 0:3:15,979
That's a mistake that most people make.


55
0:3:15,979 --> 0:3:18,811
They think that a Resource Based Economy


56
0:3:18,811 --> 0:3:23,499
has technicians that also tell you what lifestyle to use.


57
0:3:23,499 --> 0:3:26,799
No they don't. The resources determine that.


58
0:3:26,799 --> 0:3:29,379
All that the technicians do


59
0:3:29,379 --> 0:3:33,43
is build a system that can utilize those resources


60
0:3:33,43 --> 0:3:37,599
for the benefit of all the people involved.


61
0:3:37,599 --> 0:3:39,859
It has to be global.


62
0:3:39,859 --> 0:3:43,889
If it's not global, if you have most of the resources


63
0:3:43,889 --> 0:3:48,31
and most of the building equipment and most of the automated machinery


64
0:3:48,31 --> 0:3:52,859
and most of the arable land and most of the drinking water


65
0:3:52,859 --> 0:3:56,974
countries that do not have that will attempt to invade your country


66
0:3:56,974 --> 0:3:59,159
and take what they need.


67
0:3:59,159 --> 0:4:4,829
Every nation wants a piece of the pie. Keep that in mind.


68
0:4:4,829 --> 0:4:10,301
So, to the degree that you try to live a sustainable life to yourself


69
0:4:10,301 --> 0:4:12,978
will not work because other nations


70
0:4:12,978 --> 0:4:16,46
that lack material will invade you.


71
0:4:16,46 --> 0:4:19,174
In the rebuilding of cities throughout the world


72
0:4:19,174 --> 0:4:23,97
you have to consider how far those cities are from resources.


73
0:4:23,97 --> 0:4:29,64
That means available materials: concrete, steel reinforcement, etc.


74
0:4:29,64 --> 0:4:32,559
If the cities are near that source


75
0:4:32,559 --> 0:4:36,669
then it becomes more efficient to design the cities


76
0:4:36,669 --> 0:4:41,419
as systems operations, meaning that the city itself


77
0:4:41,419 --> 0:4:45,23
must meet the needs of the people that live there.


78
0:4:45,23 --> 0:4:48,465
We announce on television what is available


79
0:4:48,465 --> 0:4:51,262
and what is not available at the time


80
0:4:51,262 --> 0:4:54,274
and when it probably will be available.


81
0:4:54,274 --> 0:4:57,39
So the public has information of where to go


82
0:4:57,39 --> 0:5:0,669
to access whatever it is that they need.


83
0:5:0,669 --> 0:5:4,29
So people will have access to more things than they've ever had


84
0:5:4,29 --> 0:5:6,26
in a monetary system.


85
0:5:6,26 --> 0:5:10,25
More things and more opportunities will be available.


86
0:5:10,25 --> 0:5:13,222
All of the cities are designed


87
0:5:13,222 --> 0:5:18,548
to utilize the minimal amount of energy for maximum service.


88
0:5:18,548 --> 0:5:21,524
In that way, we conserve energy


89
0:5:21,524 --> 0:5:24,66
so that we can handle more people.


90
0:5:24,66 --> 0:5:28,3
There are people throughout the world that do not have access


91
0:5:28,3 --> 0:5:30,179
to high energy systems.


92
0:5:30,179 --> 0:5:33,735
We will be able to provide more for human need


93
0:5:33,735 --> 0:5:35,939
if we use efficiency.


94
0:5:35,939 --> 0:5:39,28
Naturally, if we fail to do that


95
0:5:39,28 --> 0:5:42,366
you can only take care of a limited amount of people.


96
0:5:42,366 --> 0:5:45,952
The Resource Based Economy has millions of slaves.


97
0:5:45,952 --> 0:5:49,911
But they are machines. And machines do repetitive


98
0:5:49,911 --> 0:5:51,973
boring and dangerous jobs.


99
0:5:51,973 --> 0:5:55,742
That's what the machines are for. They are not to put you out of work.


100
0:5:55,742 --> 0:5:59,735
If they can turn things out faster than you, we don't need you working.


101
0:5:59,735 --> 0:6:3,649
In fact we don't want you working in industrial plants.


102
0:6:3,649 --> 0:6:8,81
We want you to go back to school and study whatever you're interested in


103
0:6:8,81 --> 0:6:10,584
whatever you think you'd like to study


104
0:6:10,584 --> 0:6:14,119
whatever you feel you'd like to understand better.


105
0:6:14,119 --> 0:6:19,705
Unfortunately, money doesn't represent things in existence.


106
0:6:19,705 --> 0:6:22,569
If you set a value on every tree


107
0:6:22,569 --> 0:6:26,481
every inch of arable land, all the water


108
0:6:26,481 --> 0:6:30,3
and you printed money proportionate to the resources


109
0:6:30,3 --> 0:6:33,98
so that the money represents resources


110
0:6:33,98 --> 0:6:37,562
then it can have meaning, but today


111
0:6:37,562 --> 0:6:41,44
that is not accomplished. Although they may tell you


112
0:6:41,44 --> 0:6:47,189
that demand will really bring about these things.


113
0:6:47,189 --> 0:6:49,929
No, demand doesn't bring about the things.


114
0:6:49,929 --> 0:6:52,19
Available resources do.


115
0:6:52,19 --> 0:6:55,643
And if money doesn't represent available resources


116
0:6:55,643 --> 0:6:59,149
it has no basis for social management.


117
0:6:59,149 --> 0:7:1,76
When you live in a false society


118
0:7:1,76 --> 0:7:5,9
that bases its wealth upon money


119
0:7:5,9 --> 0:7:8,739
then that society itself will collapse eventually.


120
0:7:8,739 --> 0:7:13,973
Not because I say so. Because it's not based on physical referent.


121
0:7:13,973 --> 0:7:18,312
In a Resource Based Economy, where production and automation


122
0:7:18,312 --> 0:7:21,29
can turn out more goods and services


123
0:7:21,29 --> 0:7:24,75
there's no need to use money anymore.


124
0:7:24,75 --> 0:7:28,29
If you really wish to put an end to war, poverty


125
0:7:28,29 --> 0:7:32,429
hunger, territorial disputes


126
0:7:32,429 --> 0:7:35,989
you must utilize all the world's resources


127
0:7:35,989 --> 0:7:40,1
as the common heritage of all the world's people.


128
0:7:40,1 --> 0:7:44,39
Anything less than that will remain


129
0:7:44,39 --> 0:7:49,259
with the same problems that you've had continuously for centuries.


130
0:7:49,259 --> 0:7:52,28
Now you have to consider what I'm saying.


131
0:7:52,28 --> 0:7:57,16
The reason nations invade other nations is because of scarcity.


132
0:7:57,16 --> 0:8:0,869
When a few nations control most of the earth's resources


133
0:8:0,869 --> 0:8:3,95
you've got to have territorial disputes.


134
0:8:3,95 --> 0:8:7,209
No matter how many treaties you sign or laws you make


135
0:8:7,209 --> 0:8:10,81
if you don't declare all the earth's resources


136
0:8:10,81 --> 0:8:14,529
as the common heritage of all the world's people


137
0:8:14,529 --> 0:8:17,319
and bring all the separate nations together


138
0:8:17,319 --> 0:8:20,44
in one unified system -


139
0:8:20,44 --> 0:8:23,549
there is no solution other than that.


140
0:8:23,549 --> 0:10:23,549
And this is why we recommend the Resource Based Economy.
