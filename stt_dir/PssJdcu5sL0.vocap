###1 JEN AGG: Every once in a while, people will be just
###2 like, I don't know why you put Nutella on my foie gras.
###4 Like, they don't get it.
###5 They don't like it.
###5 But that's far more rare than the people that
###7 are like, oh my god.
###8 I could eat 10 more of these.
###10 And that's definitely me.
###11 I love that dish.
###13 It's absolutely a big part of the Hoof's identity, that
###15 young, really talented cooks come in here and find their
###17 voice and become chefs.
###18 BRANDON OLSEN: I came up with this dish.
###19 I wanted to do foie gras and banana bread.
###22 And then I realized that I like eating
###24 bananas with Nutella.
###25 I also really enjoy pain perdu.
###27 So I made banana bread into a pain perdu.
###29 And then I combined it all.
###31 JEN AGG: That's the genesis and the story of the
###33 restaurant---
###34 really, I think , though, is the cooks get to--
###36 there's so much experimentation.
###38 They're working with so many interesting things.
###39 They have to have a really strong voice to begin with.
###41 But I think every single person who's come through this
###44 kitchen has only gotten better from working here.

###61 JEN AGG: Hi, my name's Jen.
###62 I'm owner of the Black Hoof restaurant in Toronto, raw-bar
###64 and cocktail bar.
###65 What would you like know?
###66 One of the things that we are most known for and almost
###68 every diner has --unless they're coming in
###71 here all the time.
###72 They might skip it occasionally-- is the
###73 charcuterie, the cured meets.
###74 We make everything in house.
###76 It's been something right from the beginning, where--
###78 it says it, actually, on the awning-- charcuterie.
###80 And that's the starting point for what the Black Hoof is, is
###83 that we cure our own meats.
###85 BRANDON OLSEN: Small [INAUDIBLE] char, pickles.
###87 Bar, one, two, three.
###88 JEN AGG: Brandon is the chef.
###89 And he's really on top of all of that stuff.
###91 And he knows how to read the molds and how to understand
###94 when things are ready.
###95 Because you have to be very careful with it.
###96 Is a very scientific approach.
###99 BRANDON OLSEN: One of my favorite passions in life is
###101 to make cured meat.
###102 Here's our charcuterie board
###104 It's a combination of whole mussels and salumis plus two
###108 cooked products--
###109 the mortadella and the summer sausage.
###111 And it varies from day to day, depending on what I have and
###115 what I want to use.
###116 Spicy horse heart salami.
###118 Summer sausage.
###119 Pork mortadella.
###120 Capicollo.
###120 All my pork is whey-fed Berkshire.
###123 I have two farmers that I deal with.
###125 I have another farmer.
###126 That's beef.
###127 And then I also have a horse farmer out in Quebec that I
###130 get my horse hearts.
###132 This is my favorite one.
###132 This is beef and spruce.
###134 It's like eating a Christmas tree.
###136 In the spring time, we go out into the forest.
###138 And we harvest the young spruce tips, chop them up, and
###141 put them in a salumi farce and dry it out.
###145 That's a charcuterie board right there.
###147 It's a labor of love.
###149 [LAUGHS]
###150 Vance!
###152 Table 11.
###153 JEN AGG: People are in awe of what the chefs and cooks are
###157 able to do on an electric stove.
###159 It's the way that we started in the beginning.
###162 I really love that this is how we do it.
###164 The smoked sweetbreads are something we've had on the
###166 menu, again, for a really long time.
###167 There are one of the anchor dishes.
###168 Sweetbreads are the thymus gland.
###170 So it's here.
###171 And it's around the heart in baby cows.
###173 Smoked sweetbreads and tuna is probably one of my favorite
###177 Hoof dishes, my favorite Brandon dish.
###178 And you think about tuna crudo and smoked sweetbreads.
###181 Most people are like, I don't know if I want have that.
###183 It's so wacky.
###184 It's so quirky.
###186 It's so crazy.
###187 But then it just works.
###189 MALE SPEAKER: Know what I can picture you doing?
###190 Pull out that John Travolta strut, listening to the Bee
###193 Gees "Staying Alive."
###195 BRANDON OLSEN: I could probably do that.
###196 JEN AGG: Being friends with your staff, it happens no
###198 matter what.
###198 You can't avoid it.
###199 So my extra super best friend Ian is here because everyone
###206 else that I know is working.
###208 And Ian used to work here.
###209 So it kind of counts.
###211 The bond that we have is so easy.
###213 It's so--
###214 we just pick up where we left off.
###215 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: I consider myself a feminist, apart from
###217 my previous womanizing tendencies.
###218 Insofar as you definitely inspired me to stay in the
###222 restaurant industry, despite the fact that I thought it was
###224 a chauvinistic douche-bag industry.
###226 And I mean that generally.
###227 JEN AGG: It is a chauvinistic, douche-bag industry.
###228 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: No, exactly.
###229 But you showed me that it could be something different
###230 than that, insofar as-- on a individual level.
###232 JEN AGG: And you've hired so many female managers.
###234 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: Well, you know-- oh, Colin's calling me.
###236 JEN AGG: [LAUGHS]
###237 Ian met us at the Hoof.
###238 And then Ian, Brandon, and I all went to Grand Electric.
###241 It's this, like, taco restaurant.
###245 You may have heard of it.
###246 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: Just tacos.
###247 JEN AGG: Tacos and stuff.
###248 Bourbon and tacos.
###249 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: Yeah, dicks.
###250 JEN AGG: Even though Grand Electric and the Hoof don't
###252 feel like the same restaurant, I feel like they're connected.
###254 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: Colin's my business partner.
###256 And he likes knife fights.
###258 We use to live with each other and also worked with each
###261 other at Jen's restaurant.
###262 JEN AGG: You almost said great!
###262 They took a lot of things that they learned here and applied
###265 them to a slightly different model of doing things.
###268 And they've just--
###269 It's exploded.
###269 It's so amazing.
###271 COLIN TOOKE: We specialize in fine Mexican cuisine.
###274 
###278 We're going make something for you tonight.
###279 Albacore tuna ceviche.
###281 Marinated albacore tuna there, avocado mayo, tostada shell.
###284 Now today, he's going to put a little herb salad on top, a
###287 little bit of crispy shallots, tweaked Mexicano.
###289 That looks pretty.
###290 That's squid from Goo.
###291 We stole it from Goo.
###292 It's the best thing ever in the city.
###294 So we just replicate it in a Mexican style.
###296 He's going to make so it doesn't fall over.
###299 We marinate it, deep fry it, sauce it.
###301 Pretty grimy.
###302 Squid sauce that we make, it's peppers and sweetness.
###305 We make our own mayo.
###306 Come on, bro.
###308 Yeah, we make our own mayo.
###309 Oh, this guy's building a mountain over here.
###310 Put the serranos on there.
###313 MALE SPEAKER 2: That's about it.
###314 There you go.
###316 COLIN TOOKE: Squid, man.
###318 JEN AGG: With Ian and Colin, there was a bond
###319 formed a long time ago.
###321 And when they left, it was so hard.
###322 But I was so happy for them and so proud of
###325 what they were doing.
###326 Ah, this is really good.
###328 COLIN TOOKE: Brandon we--
###330 I remember when you cried the last day at work.
###332 When I left.
###333 You were.
###334 Remember on my last when you cried?
###336 You remember when I left and you cried?
###338 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: Brendan do you remember that?
###340 How did--
###341 Show me on the doll where he touched you.
###342 BRANDON: I'm in touch with my feelings.
###346 JEN AGG: Oh yeah, good idea.
###347 Shots of bourbon.
###347 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: This a reality show about being real.
###349 [DRUM ROLLS]
###350 COLIN TOOKE: Come let's be real.
###351 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: 7 things of the Pappy 20 year.
###357 JEN AGG: Oh, wow.
###358 BRANDON: That's good, eh?
###360 JEN AGG: It's like a gentle velvet strangulation.
###362 
###366 Why are you wrecking my fucking comedy?
###367 I think we're going, Colin.
###369 Let's get ready to go.
###371 OK.
###373 COLIN TOOKE: There we go.
###374 JEN AGG: Now I'm kind of drunk
###375 I see them a lot, but we don't necessarily get
###377 to hang-out a lot.
###379 Oh Colin.
###380 COLIN TOOKE: Bank walk.
###381 JEN AGG: Ah, God.
###381 Jesus, Colin.
###381 Ah, shit.
###382 That was really fun just to be squished up in a car.
###386 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: There's something poking into
###387 something else.
###388 JEN AGG: [LAUGHS]
###389 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: Oh, boy.
###390 COLIN TOOKE: [MAKES GAGING NOISES]
###391 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: Oh, god.
###392 Oh, god.
###393 Oh, fuck!
###394 JEN AGG: There's spittle.
###395 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: He's getting red and shit.
###396 Ugh.
###396 [JAZZ MUSIC]
###397 JEN AGG: Ah!
###398 Oh fuck, Colin!
###399 Yeah seriously, puke.
###401 It's all oozing.
###402 Disgusting.
###404 Cold Tea is the bar that we seem to be going to the most.
###408 We're overrun with hipster bars.
###409 And there are a couple of cocktail bars.
###411 Matt and his partners, of course, totally nailed the
###413 concept of doing a hipster bar.
###415 But also, hey, there might be some people that want to have
###417 a delicious cocktail.
###418 That concept meeting each other, it's the first time
###420 I've seen that done.
###421 And they do it so well.
###422 And the design of the place is just awesome.
###424 The have a cocktail there.
###425 Green Dragon, I think, is what it's called.
###426 It's tequila, muddled pineapple, and cucumber, and
###431 lime juice.
###431 And it's so simple and is so good.
###433 Would you say this is my favorite drink in the city?
###436 SARAH PARNIAK: I don't know.
###437 Would you say it?
###438 JEN AGG: Normally, I drink wine.
###439 But for Sarah, I drink this.
###442 [WHISPERS]
###442 We should probably have some shots.
###443 Um, yeah.
###443 Bourbon and Bronco, sure.
###445 Is that a thing?
###446 Taste it.
###449 Really good.
###450 I was actually going to feed it to you, so
###452 you'd look extra gay.
###454 Get out of there.
###454 No, no.
###455 It's really good, right?
###456 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: My ass pussy was sweating last night.
###459 JEN AGG: Guys, you're giving me a headache.
###461 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: Pussy?
###463 JEN AGG: Yeah, I am getting a headache in my pussy.
###465 Oh, well!
###465 Oh!
###466 That's a good idea.
###467 GROUP: Cheers.
###469 JEN AGG: Pretty good.
###471 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: What?
###471 It's bourbon and Bronco?
###473 Woo!
###473 I could drink that for breakfast.
###475 MALE SPEAKER 2: Yeah, you should.
###477 JEN AGG: OK, we got to go do nachos now.
###478 I'm fucking going to die.
###480 How do people have the stamina for this shit?
###482 It's fucking old, man.
###484 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: Where are we going for the munchies?
###485 JEN AGG: Ah, Black Hoof?
###487 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: Sick.
###487 JEN AGG: I think it's pretty much--
###490 hey.
###491 It's a spoon.
###492 This is all a spoon.
###493 It's one giant spoon, except for Colin, who doesn't get
###496 spooned at all.
###496 COLIN TOOKE: I don't fucking care.
###498 I ain't fucking [INAUDIBLE]
###499 JEN AGG: Oh, bullshit!
###500 You love spooning, no question.
###501 COLIN TOOKE: Fuck that.
###502 JEN AGG: Colin, don't be a dick.
###503 [LAUGHTER]
###504 IAN MCGRENAGHAN: Oh!
###505 JEN AGG: I think this where we're going to eat--
###507 BRANDON: It's like you're breaking and entering.
###507 JEN AGG: To eat nachos or something.
###511 I really don't understand how I was physically able to put
###513 that nacho platter together.
###516 That was something.
###516 [LAUGHS]
###518 I'm too old for all that drinking.
###520 And I'm actually still recovering from that.
###522 So thank you very much for all of that fun.
###524 We're going to have some fairly ghetto nachos, even
###527 though we've already had Mexican food tonight.
###528 But this is more like whitey Mexican food.
###531 We did sort of a Mexican-Tex--
###532 Tex-Mex kind of influence, with lots of cheese.
###535 Because that's not really super Mexican.
###536 Grated three pounds of cheese.
###539 Brandon made this--
###540 This is a chili tongue, right?
###542 BRANDON: Yeah.
###543 JEN AGG: It's like chili but made with tongue.
###545 Brandon, this smells awesome.
###547 BRANDON: It smells awesome.
###549 Looks like cat food, though.
###551 JEN AGG: Doesn't matter.
###552 It's nachos.
###554 Mm, la!
###556 All right.
###557 It's pretty basic salsa.
###558 I don't even want to brag about what's in it.
###559 It's whatever.
###560 But it is agave syrup.
###561 It's really good.
###562 OK, into the oven with you, Nessie!
###567 One thing that I think is really important is a real
###570 sense of family.
###571 And I know that's something that everyone in the industry
###573 says and pays lip service to.
###575 But they're saying it.
###576 And then there's actually doing it.
###578 There's actually caring about the people who work for you.
###579 And there's-- you know, you want to come, when you're
###581 spending this much time in a place, you want to come
###583 somewhere where you can be happy and
###586 comfortable and feel good.
###587 
###590 That was the worst.
###591 That was just a mess.
###594 [LAUGHS]
###596 MALE SPEAKER 3: No it wasn't.
###598 JEN AGG: No it wasn't.
###599 Brandon is--
###599 may be--
###600 may be an undiagnosed narcoleptic.
###604 And that's been the been the joke around
###606 here for a long time.
###607 There's people everywhere.
###608 There's nachos everywhere.
###610 But that's his special skill is that he can
###613 sleep anywhere, anytime.
###615 It doesn't matter.
###617 Yeah, and I don't think that'll ever go away.
###618 I think that's his trademark.
###620
