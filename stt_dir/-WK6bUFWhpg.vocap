###1 PROFESSOR: ALL RIGHT, WELL, IT'S GREAT TO SEE THIS MANY OF YOU
###2 HERE THIS MORNING. I DIDN'T ACTUALLY EXPECT IT WITH THE EXAM
###5 TONIGHT, SO KUDOS TO ALL OF YOU FOR SHOWING UP TODAY. AND I'VE
###11 HEARD THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE HAVING
###14 DIFFICULTY LOCATING THE LECTURE NOTES THAT I'VE BEEN POSTING.
###19 SO BE SURE TO LOOK FOR THOSE ON BSPACE, NOT ON THE BIO 1B
###23 WEBSITE. YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED E-MAILS AFTER EACH LECTURE
###26 WITH THE LINK TO THE LECTURE NOTES, BUT IF YOU DIDN'T, YOU CAN GO
###31 TO THE BSPACE SITE. LOG IN WITH YOUR CAL ID. GO TO MY ACTIVE
###36 SITES, THE MENU UP, IN THE UPPER LEFT, RIGHT OF THE MENU. AND
###41 UNDER THERE YOU SHOULD FIND THE LINK WHICH SAYS BIO 1B LECTURE,
###47 PLANTS, FALL 10. AND THEN CLICK THERE. AND THAT WILL TAKE YOU
###54 TO A SCREEN WHERE YOU'LL SEE RESOURCES AS ONE OF THE CHOICES ON
###59 THE LEFT. CLICK RESOURCES AND YOU'LL FIND THE, THE LECTURE
###63 FOLDER, AND JUST OPEN THAT UP AND ALL THE LECTURE PRESENTATIONS
###67 ARE IN THERE WITH THE NOTES EMBEDDED IN. SO PLEASE CHECK THAT
###71 OUT. AND IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE, JUST GIVE ME AN E-MAIL. OKAY,
###75 ALSO DON'T FORGET ON SUNDAY NIGHT TO CHANGE THE CLOCK BACK ONE
###79 HOUR OR YOU'LL SHOW UP AN HOUR EARLY FOR LECTURE WHICH I'M SURE
###82 YOU'D RATHER NOT DO BECAUSE I CERTAINLY WON'T BE HERE THEN.
###88 OKAY, SO WE'RE GOING TO START OUT TODAY JUST GOING BACK OVER,
###93 ACTUALLY, CONTINUING THIS SURVEY OF THE ALGAE AND LOOKING AT THE
###98 LAST MAJOR FORM OF LIFE CYCLE. AND IT'S ACTUALLY THE ONE WE'LL
###102 BE LOOKING AT FOR THE REST OF THE COURSE, SO IT'S REALLY
###104 
###104 IMPORTANT TO IN PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THIS ONE WHICH ISN'T COMMON
###109 TO ALL THE ALGAE, JUST SOME OF THEM, BUT IT'S FOUND IN ALL THE
###112 LAND PLANTS. AND THEN WE'LL GET TO SOME ALGAL USES. AND THEN
###115 TALK ABOUT THE INVASION OF LAND BY PLANTS WHICH WILL BE A THEME
###120 INTO THE NEXT LECTURE AS WELL. OKAY, I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE
###124 JUMP BACK TO THE FUNGI THOUGH, THIS SLIDE YOU MIGHT REMEMBER
###128 ABOUT PENICILLIN. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WHAT I WAS TRYING TO
###131 GET ACROSS HERE BECAUSE IT WAS A BIT UNCLEAR THE WAY I PRESENTED
###135 IT, THAT PENICILLIN REALLY, THE MAJOR POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE
###140 HERE IS THAT THE, THE CELL WALLS OF BACTERIA ARE DIFFERENT FROM
###144 THE CELL WALLS OF ALL EUKARYOTES, OKAY. THEY'RE COMPRISED OF
###150 PEPTIDOGLYCANS, WHICH AS THE NAME IMPLIES ARE MADE UP OF AN
###157 AMINO, OF AMINO ACIDS AND SUGARS. AND PENICILLIN ACTS TO
###163 INTERFERE WITH THE ENZYMES THE BACTERIA NEED TO SYNTHESIZE THE
###166 PEPTIDOGLYCANS. AND WITHOUT THEIR CELL WALLS, THE BACTERIA WILL
###170 BURST. AND SO IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE AS A MEDICINE BECAUSE OF
###174 COURSE WE LACK CELL WALLS. AND FUNGI CAN GET AWAY WITH
###177 PRODUCING IT BECAUSE THEIR CELL WALLS OF COURSE ARE MADE OF
###180 CHITIN WHICH IS, I MENTIONED THAT A FEW TIME EARLIER, THE SAME
###186 CARBOHYDRATE THAT ARTHROPOD EXOSKELETONS ARE MADE OF, OR
###191 ORGANISMS LIKE CRUSTACEANS AND INSECTS. SO I JUST WANT TO ADD
###195 THAT EXTRA CONTEXT HERE AND HOPE THAT IS A LITTLE CLEARER NOW.
###198 ALL RIGHT, SO AS FAR AS THE ALGAE GO, I JUST WANT TO RECAP THE
###204 MAIN POINTS SO FAR BEFORE WE LAUNCH BACK IN, OOPS, OOPS, YEAH,
###209 THAT'S RIGHT. SO REMEMBER THAT THE CYANOBACTERIA, THE
###214 
###214 BLUE/GREEN BACTERIA, THESE SHARE THE ABILITY TO PHOTOSYNTHESIZE,
###219 TO USE LIGHT TO CAPTURE ATMOSPHERIC CARBON, FIX IT AS SUGAR.
###224 AND THEY'RE THE ONLY ORGANISMS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY EVOLVED
###228 PHOTOSYNTHESIS. I SHOULDN'T SAY THE ONLY ONES, BUT THE ONES THAT
###232 EVOLVE PHOTOSYNTHESIS THAT ALL THE ALGAE HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY TAKEN
###237 ADVANTAGE OF. SO THE EVOLUTION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS BY
###241 CYANOBACTERIA REPRESENTS THE SOLE EVOLUTIONARY EVENT THAT
###246 RESULTED IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS. AND THEN ALL THE OTHER ALGAL
###249 LINEAGES BASICALLY JUST CAPTURED CYANOBACTERIA EITHER DIRECTLY OR
###253 INDIRECTLY AND HAVE UTILIZED THEIR EVOLUTIONARY INNOVATION THAT
###259 WAY. AND ONLY ONE MAJOR LINEAGE OF THE CYANOBACTERIA GAVE RISE
###266 TO ALL OF THE PLASTIDS, THE CHLOROPLASTS, AND OTHER PLASTIDS IN
###271 THE EUKARYOTIC ALGAE. OKAY, SO THAT --
###276 STUDENT: IS THE CYANOBACTERIA THE FIRST [INAUDIBLE]
###283 PROFESSOR: AS FAR AS I KNOW, YEAH. THAT'S, THAT'S ALL, I'M
###285 ONLY FAMILIAR WITH, WITH CYANOBACTERIA. I MEAN ONE OF THE
###288 THINGS WE'RE GOING TO SEE, THERE'S QUITE A FEW SINGLE EVENTS IN,
###293 I MEAN IF WE LOOK BACK TO THE LAND PLANTS, THEY ALL SEEM TO STEM
###296 FROM ONE ANCESTOR. PHYTOSYNTHESIS SEEMS TO STEM BACK TO ONE
###300 LINEAGE. BUT IT'S HARD TO SAY, YOU KNOW, IF THERE WERE
###303 EVOLUTION-, IF THERE WERE OTHER TRIAL BALLOONS OUT THERE THAT
###307 JUST DIDN'T SUCCEED AND THEY WERE OUT COMPETED. IT'S DIFFICULT.
###312 I MEAN THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ONE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON EARTH.
###314 AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL THERE'S JUST ONE LINEAGE OF LIFE AND ALL
###319 LIVING ORGANISMS DESCEND FROM THAT COMMON ANCESTOR. BUT THERE
###322 
###322 COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW, LIVING OR
###325 SEMI-LIVING, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM, TYPES OF THINGS OUT
###328 THERE THAT COULDN'T COMPETE WITH THE ORGANISM THAT GAVE RISE TO
###332 LIFE.
###332 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
###337 PROFESSOR: WELL, THAT ALL THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC EUKARYOTES HAVE
###341 CAPTURED THE CYANOBACTER-, RESULT FROM AN EVENT, THIS
###347 ENDOSYMBIOTIC EVENT WHERE CYANOBACTERIA WERE CAPTURED. AND THIS
###353 BASICALLY, THIS TREE ENCOMPASSES ALL OF THE MAIN LINEAGES OF
###357 EUKARYOTIC ORGANISMS THAT DESCEND FROM THAT EVENT. AND THAT
###365 INCLUDES ALL OF THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS. THE GREEN ALGAE,
###369 AS I'LL POINT OUT LATER, ULTIMATELY GAVE RISE TO LAND PLANTS.
###374 SO THIS IS, THIS IS PRETTY MUCH IT. SO IT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE
###377 ONE EVENT THAT GAVE RISE TO, TO ALL THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS
###381 THAT WE CALL ALGAE OR LAND PLANTS. SO AGAIN, WE HAVE THIS MAJOR
###386 DIVERGENCE BETWEEN THIS FIRST MAJOR SPLIT BETWEEN EUKARYOTIC
###392 PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS, RED ALGAE ON THE ONE HAND AND GREEN
###396 ALGAE ON THE OTHER. AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE GROUPS IN A
###399 LITTLE MORE DETAIL IN A MOMENT. BUT I WANT TO, I WAS STARTING
###403 OUT FIRST TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE OTHER LINEAGES THAT
###407 ORIGINATED FROM A SECONDARY ENDOSYMBIOSIS OR ACQUIRED THEIR
###410 PLASTIDS, THEIR CHLOROPLASTS BY SECONDARY ENDOSYMBIOSIS WHERE
###414 THEY ENGULFED A EUKARYOTIC PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISM, EITHER A
###420 GREEN ALGA OR RED ALGA. AND THIS LEAD TO A NUMBER OF LINEAGES.
###425 I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS ONE BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY
###428 
###428 MINOR. BUT I DID MENTION THERE'S A MAJOR LINEAGE HERE. THE
###434 EUGLENIDS WHICH CAPTURED THEIR CHLOROPLAST BY CAPTURING A
###440 UNICELLULAR GREEN EUKARYOTIC ALGAE. AND THEY HAVE A FLAGELLUM
###446 WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO MOVE AROUND QUICKLY LIKE YOU CAN SEE HERE.
###450 IT'S VERY DISTINCTIVE. IT HAS SOME CRYSTALLINE INCLUSION IN IT
###453 THAT YOU CAN DO A SECTION OF IT. IT'S VERY DISTINCTIVE. THEIR
###457 PLASTID IS VERY MUCH LIKE A GREEN ALGA, SO THAT THAT IN ADDITION
###460 TO THE MOLECULAR DATA MAKE IT REALLY CLEAR. BUT MOST OF THEM
###464 ACTUALLY CAN STILL CAPTURE PREY. THEY CAN STILL ENGULF PREY.
###468 AND SO IT'S, EVEN THE, YOU CAN SEE THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR A
###472 SECONDARY ENDOSYMBIOSIS, YOU KNOW, TO ACTUALLY STILL ENGULF AN
###477 ORGANISM THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BECOME A SYMBIONT IS EVEN STILL
###480 PRESENT IN THESE ORGANISMS, EVEN THE ONES THAT ARE PHOTOSYNTHETIC
###484 IN PART IN MANY CASES. OKAY. AND THEN THE OTHER MAIN LINEAGE,
###491 THE ONES, THE SECONDARY ENDOSYMBIONTS THAT CAPTURE RED ALGAE
###494 INCLUDE THESE ONES. AND I MENTIONED LAST TIME THE
###497 DINOFLAGELLATES, WHICH LIKE THE EUGLENIDS ARE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF
###501 PHYTOPLANKTON. AND REMEMBER PHYTOPLANKTON JUST MEANS BASICALLY
###506 PLANKTON WHICH ARE FREE-FLOATING ORGANISMS IN AQUATIC SITUATIONS,
###509 UNICELLULAR ONES TYPICALLY. PHYTO MEANS PLANT, SO PHOTOSYNTHETIC
###515 BASICALLY. SO DINOFLAGELLATES DESCEND FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR
###520 WITH THESE OTHER GROUPS THAT HAD A RED ALGA INCORPORATED INTO
###525 THEIR CELLS. AND A GOOD NUMBER OF THE DINOFLAGELLATES ARE STILL
###528 PHOTOSYNTHETIC. SOME OF THEM HAVE LOST THE ABILITY TO
###532 PHOTOSYNTHESIZE AND STRICTLY ARE HETEROTROPHIC AND ARE ACTUALLY
###536 
###536 PRETTY GOOD PREDATORS IN SOME CASES. BUT I SHOWED YOU SOME
###541 PHOTOS, OOPS, OF THESE LAST TIME. AND THEY HAVE THIS EXTERNAL
###548 ARMOR, THESE PLATES OF CELLULOSE. AND CELLULOSE AGAIN IS THE
###552 SAME CARBOHYDRATE THAT -- WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THIS YET -- BUT IN
###555 PLANTS THE CELL WALLS, THE LAND PLANTS HAVE CELL WALLS OF
###559 CELLULOSE AS WELL, BUT THIS APPEARS TO BE AN INDEPENDENT ORIGIN
###562 OF THAT. ANYWAYS, THESE HAVE SOME INTERESTING ECOLOGY,
###566 ESPECIALLY IN OCEANIC SITUATIONS THAT I MENTIONED LAST TIME WITH
###570 THE RED TIDES AND TOXINS, BIOLUMINESCENCE. THE OTHER REALLY
###578 MAJOR GROUP OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS THAT DESCENDED FROM THIS
###584 SECONDARY ENDOSYMBIOSIS INVOLVING A RED ALGA ARE WHAT'S CALLED
###587 THE STRAMENOPILES. AND THAT NAME'S NOT SO IMPORTANT, BUT IT'S
###593 BASICALLY A GROUP THAT INCLUDES A HUGE DIVERSITY OF DIFFERENT
###596 GROUPS OF ORGANISMS AND SEVERAL THAT ARE PHOTOSYNTHETIC THAT
###601 WE'VE LONG RECOGNIZED AS DISTINCT GROUPS. BUT NOW IT'S CLEAR
###604 THAT THEY'RE ALL VERY CLOSELY RELATED. WOOPS. AND ONE OF
###610 THESE IS THE DIATOMS, WHICH I JUST GOT, I WAS JUST GETTING TO AT
###616 THE END OF LAST LECTURE. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE
###619 GROUPS OF ALGAE. THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND SPECIES
###623 DESCRIBED. AND REMEMBER THAT'S ROUGHLY THE SAME DIVERSITY THAT
###626 WE SEE ACROSS ALL OF THE FUNGAL PHYLA, SO THAT'S A HUGE NUMBER OF
###631 TAXA. YOU KNOW IT'S, IT'S ROUGHLY A THIRD OF WHAT WE'VE
###635 RECOGNIZED AMONG THE FLOWERING PLANTS. SO IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF
###639 DIVERSITY. AND YOU CAN SEE, GET SOME SENSE OF THIS DIVERSITY.
###643 IT'S REALLY CLEAR MORPHOLOGICALLY THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH LOTS
###645 
###645 OF DIFFERENT GROUPS OF ORGANISMS HERE. AND ONE OF THE REASONS
###649 THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM DESCRIBED, WELL, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF
###651 REASONS. WELL, FOR ONE THING, THEY'RE INCREDIBLY ABUNDANT. YOU
###655 FIND THEM IN HUGE NUMBERS. IF YOU JUST TAKE A SCOOP OF SEA WATER
###658 OR LAKE WATER IN DIFFERENT AQUATIC SETTINGS OR MARINE SETTINGS,
###661 YOU CAN FIND LARGE NUMBERS OF DIATOMS TYPICALLY AND A LOT OF
###665 DIVERSITY. BUT THEY ALSO ARE MORPHOLOGICALLY DIFFERENTIATED
###671 OFTENTIMES BY THEIR CELL WALLS, WHICH YOU CAN SEE ARE REALLY
###675 EXTENSIVELY ORNAMENTED. AND THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES AND
###679 SIZES OF THESE THINGS IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT TAXA. AND THESE
###683 CELL WALLS ARE REALLY AMAZING BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTUALLY LARGELY
###686 MADE UP OF, OF HYDRATED SILICA LIKE GLASS, AND THEY PRESERVE
###691 REALLY WELL THEN IN THE FOSSIL RECORD. THEY'RE INERT. AND WE
###695 HAVE AN EXCELLENT FOSSIL RECORD OF DIATOMS THAT GOES WAY BACK.
###699 AND PALEOBOTANISTS THAT WORK IN THIS GROUP HAVE LOTS OF STORIES
###704 TO TELL FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD, USUALLY REALLY RICH AND PRETTY
###706 COMPLETE RECORDS. THERE'S ALSO EXTENSIVE DEPOSITS OF
###712 DIATOMACEOUS EARTH IT'S CALLED THAT'S REALLY VALUABLE. IT'S
###716 MINED EXTENSIVELY WHERE YOU FIND THESE DEPOSITS OF DIATOM
###719 SKELETONS AND USED FOR FILTRATE AND A WIDE VARIETY OF PURPOSES.
###727 BUT THERE'S ONE REALLY HUGE DEPOSIT DOWN IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY
###731 NEAR LOMPOC. IF YOU EVER DOWN IN THAT AREA, THEY'VE BEEN MINING
###734 THAT FOR MANY DECADES. AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS
###739 ABOUT DIATOMS IS THAT THEY MAY ACCOUNT FOR UP TO 25 PERCENT OF
###745 THE PHOTOSYNTHESIS, THE PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY THAT'S GOING ON ON
###749 
###749 EARTH. SO THEY'RE PUMPING OUT A HUGE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN. THEY'RE
###754 CAPTURING A LOT OF CO2. AND THEY'RE CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE
###760 CRUCIAL ORGANISMS FOR MAINTAINING ATMOSPHERIC CO2 AT A REASONABLE
###765 LEVEL. SO THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS TO ACTUALLY TRY TO INCREASE
###769 THE NUMBER OF DIATOMS IN THE OCEAN BY DUMPING LARGE AMOUNTS OF
###773 IRON INTO THE OCEAN. BUT SO FAR THAT HASN'T HAPPENED BECAUSE
###779 THESE MAJOR TYPES OF ECOSYSTEM INTERVENTIONS LIKE THAT SOMETIMES
###783 HAVE UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES, AND IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR WHAT THAT
###786 MIGHT END UP RESULTING IN. YOU KNOW, THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS MIGHT
###790 OUTWEIGH THE POSITIVE ONES. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DIATOMS
###794 DO THAT'S IMPORTANT IN ADDITION TO FIXING CO2 IS THAT WHEN THEY
###800 DIE, THEY TEND TO SINK. AND SO THEY ACTUALLY END UP ON THE
###804 OCEAN FLOOR. AND BY DOING THAT, THEY TAKE THAT CARBON OUT OF
###808 THE ECOSYSTEM ESSENTIALLY. AND SO THAT CARBON'S NOT
###812 RECIRCULATING BACK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. AND SO THEY CAN REALLY
###817 STORE A LOT OF, THEY CAN TAKE CARBON OUT OF THE SYSTEM WHICH
###820 WOULD BE A REALLY VALUABLE THING RIGHT NOW. OKAY, AND ONE OF
###825 THE STRANGEST THINGS ABOUT THESE GUYS IS THAT THESE ARE
###828 UNICELLULAR TYPICALLY. SOMETIMES THEY'LL BE IN FILAMENTS, BUT
###832 THEY'RE SEPARATE CELLS, SEPARATE ORGANISMS. AND AS YOU CAN MAYBE
###836 MAKE OUT HERE, NOT VERY WELL, THEY ARE, THEIR CELL WALL IS
###841 BASICALLY LIKE TWO HALVES OF A PETRI DISH WITH ONE-HALF INSIDE
###846 THE OTHER ONE. AND SO WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GO TO REPRODUCE, IT'S
###850 PRETTY BIZARRE. BUT, I SHOULD MENTION FIRST OF ALL THAT THEY
###856 ACTUALLY HAVE AN ANIMAL-LIKE LIFE CYCLE IN TERMS OF THE, THE TYPE
###859 
###859 OF, WELL, THAT THE FACT THAT THERE'S ONLY, THE ONLY HAPLOID STAGE
###863 IS THE GAMETES, SO THEY'RE JUST LIKE US THAT WAY. THE MATURE
###868 DIATOM IS DIPLOID. AND THEY HAVE, BASICALLY FERTILIZATION
###876 HAPPENS RIGHT AFTER MEIOSIS LIKE IT DOES WITH US. THOUGH THAT'S
###881 AN INTERESTING DIFFERENCE FROM OTHER GROUPS. THEY ALSO
###886 REPRODUCE BY SEMI-CONSERVATIVE REPLICATION IN A SENSE. IT'S
###889 ALMOST LIKE DNA REPLICATION IN THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE, EACH HALF
###892 OF THEIR SHELL, THEY MOSTLY ASEXUALLY REPRODUCE WITHOUT SEX,
###897 MOSTLY. BUT WHEN THEY ASEXUALLY REPRODUCE, THE TWO HALVES OF THE
###901 SHELL SEPARATE AND A NEW HALF FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE HALVES IS
###906 CREATED INSIDE THE OLD ONE. SO IF YOU'RE CREATING NEW SHELLS
###910 INSIDE THE OLD HALF ALL THE TIME, AT LEAST SOME OF THE LINEAGES
###914 ARE GOING TO GET TO BE PROGRESSIVELY SMALLER THROUGH TIME. AND
###920 THAT DECREASE IN SIZE OF COURSE IS GOING TO REACH A CRITICAL
###922 THRESHOLD AT SOME POINT. AND ROUGHLY AROUND THAT TIME, THESE
###928 LINEAGES ARE STIMULATED TO START PRODUCING GAMETES. AND THEY
###932 UNDERGO SEXUAL REPRODUCTION WHEN THEY GET TOO SMALL. AND THEY
###937 RELEASE THEIR GAMETES. THE TWO HALVES OF THE SHELL SEPARATE,
###940 RELEASE THE GAMETES WHICH HAVE BEEN PRODUCED OF COURSE BY MEIOSIS
###943 BECAUSE THEY'RE DIPLOID ADULT ORGANISMS. THE GAMETES GET
###948 TOGETHER WITH THOSE OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS, MAKE A ZYGOTE, AND THEN
###951 THAT DEVELOPS INTO A NEW DIPLOID FULLY-SIZED DIATOM. SO THAT'S
###957 ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT DIATOM REPRODUCTION.
###963 OKAY, SO ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT DIATOMS? YEAH?
###965 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
###969 PROFESSOR: WELL, DIATOMACEOUS EARTH IS USED INDUSTRIALLY FOR
###974 LOTS OF DIFFERENT PURPOSES. IT'S AN ABRASIVE. IT CAN BE USED
###979 AS AN ABRASIVE. I MEAN IT IS, YOU KNOW, SILICA IS INVOLVED.
###983 AND IT'S ALSO, WELL, THERE'S, YEAH, IT GOES ON AND ON. BUT IT,
###990 IT'S USED AS A FILTRATE. THE DIATOMS HAVE, YOU KNOW THEY'RE SO
###994 TINY, AND THERE'S SOME POROSITY TO THEIR SKELETONS, I MEAN TO
###999 THEIR CELL WALLS. SO IT'S, YEAH, THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF USES.
###1004 BUT, YEAH, IT'S HARVESTED ON A MASS SCALE. I MEAN IT'S MINED ON
###1007 A LARGE SCALE FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIAL USES. OKAY,
###1015 SO THE DIATOMS ARE JUST ONE GROUP OF STRAMENOPILES, THAT ONE
###1019 CLADE I MENTIONED THAT HAS QUITE A FEW PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS
###1023 IN IT. ANOTHER ONE OF THE GOLDEN ALGAE, AND THESE ARE ALSO
###1026 UNICELLULAR OR COLONIAL, BUT THEY'RE MOSTLY IN FRESHWATER.
###1030 DIATOMS ARE EITHER FRESH OR SEA WATER. BUT THEY'RE CALLED GOLDEN
###1035 I JUST WANT TO MENTION BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS GOLDEN APPEARANCE
###1038 BECAUSE THEY HAVE THESE, THESE ACCESSORY PIGMENTS IN THEIR
###1043 PLASTIDS IN ADDITION TO CHLOROPHYL THAT ARE USEFUL FOR CAPTURING
###1047 LIGHT AT WAVE LENGTHS THAT PENETRATE WATER WELL. AND THAT'S
###1052 SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO SEE IN THEIR CLOSE RELATIVES THE BROWN
###1056 ALGAE WHICH ARE MOSTLY MARINE. ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE FOUND IN
###1060 THE OCEAN. AND THEY ALSO HAVE THIS YELLOWISH OR BROWNISH COLOR
###1065 FROM THESE ACCESSORY PIGMENTS. WELL, IT USED TO BE THOUGHT THAT
###1069 THESE ARE PRETTY CLOSELY RELATED TO LAND PLANTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE
###1073 PRETTY SIMILAR MORPHOLOGY AND SOME OF THEM HAVE SIMILAR LIFE
###1076 CYCLES. BUT NOW WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE ACTUALLY A COMPLETELY
###1080 
###1080 DISTINCT LINEAGE OF EUKARYOTES THAT HAVE CAPTURED PLASTIDS. YOU
###1084 KNOW, THEY DESCEND FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR WITH THE DIATOMS, THE
###1089 GOLDENS. AND EVEN THE DINOFLAGELLATES THAT CAPTURED A RED ALGA,
###1092 HAVE AN ANCESTOR THAT CAPTURED A RED ALGA, THEY DON'T DESCEND
###1096 FROM THE GREEN ALGAL LINEAGE. AND THIS INCLUDES SOME OF OUR
###1100 REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND LARGE KELPS. WE FIND THESE WORLDWIDE, BUT
###1107 OFF OUR COAST WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR MEMBERS THAT
###1112 BOTH IN THE INTERTIDAL REGION UP IN THE WAVES, THE WAVE-CRASHING
###1116 ZONE AS WELL AS OUT IN DEEP WATER. SO UP IN THE INTERTIDAL ZONE,
###1121 IF YOU'VE BEEN OUT ALONG OUR COAST, THIS NORTH COAST IN SOME OF
###1126 THE ROUGHEST AREAS OF THE INTERTIDAL ZONE WHERE THE WAVES ARE
###1129 CONSTANTLY BREAKING AGAINST ROCKS, YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN THESE
###1133 THINGS. THEY LOOK LIKE LITTLE PALM TREES OUT THERE. THIS IS THE
###1137 SEA PALM IT'S CALLED, POSTELSIA PALMAEFORMIS, WHICH IS ACTUALLY
###1141 EDIBLE. I'VE EATEN THIS. IT'S PRETTY GOOD. BUT IT'S ONLY
###1145 HARVESTED ON A LOW, ON A MINOR SCALE. BUT IT DEMONSTRATES FIRST
###1150 THAT SOME OF THE FEATURES OF KELPS THAT LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE THAT
###1154 ARE LAND PLANTS. FIRST OF ALL LOOK AT THIS THING. IT LOOKS
###1157 VERY TREE-LIKE. IT HAS BLADES UP HERE THAT ARE HIGHLY PACKED
###1164 WITH PLASTIDS WHERE WE GET A LOT THE PHOTOSYNTHESIS OCCURRING.
###1168 THEY LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE LEAVES OF THE FLOWERING PLANT. THAT'S
###1171 CONVERGENT EVOLUTION, AND THERE'S NO CLOSE RELATIONSHIP. THEY
###1175 ALSO HAVE A STEM-LIKE STIPE OR STOCK HERE THAT LOOKS VERY
###1180 STEM-LIKE BUT THAT'S COMPLETELY CONVERGENT AS WELL. AND THEY
###1183 HAVE A HOLDFAST THAT AFFIXES THEM TO THE SUBSTRATE, AND THAT'S
###1187 
###1187 ALSO, THEY LOOK ROOT-LIKE, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT IS. IT'S
###1190 AN, IT'S BASICALLY AN ATTACHMENT STRUCTURE RATHER THAN A
###1195 CONDUCTING STRUCTURE. AND THESE THINGS CAN WITHSTAND WAVES
###1200 CRASHING AGAINST THEM THAT WOULD TEAR ANY, ANY OTHER UPRIGHT
###1203 ORGANISM APART. AND VARIOUS BIOMECHANICISTS THAT HAVE BEEN
###1208 INTERESTED IN THE, THE WAY THAT ORGANISMS CAN SURVIVE IN THIS
###1212 ZONE WHERE YOU HAVE THE WAVES CRASHING AGAINST THEM CONSTANTLY
###1214 CAN'T REALLY EASILY ACCOUNT FOR THESE GUYS BECAUSE THEY BREAK ALL
###1219 THE RULES. AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THESE, THESE
###1224 IMPACTS. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT IN THIS REGARD
###1227 IS THAT THEIR CELL WALLS ARE BATHED IN THIS GEL-LIKE
###1233 POLYSACCHARIDES, THIS KIND OF MUCILAGINOUS POLYSACCHARIDE WHICH
###1237 IS FOUND ACROSS THE BROWN ALGAE. AND ALSO WE'LL SHOW LATER IN
###1241 THE RED ALGAE AS WELL THOUGH IT'S DIFFERENT BIOCHEMICALLY THERE.
###1246 BUT THESE MUCILAGINOUS POLYSACCHARIDES GIVE THIS THING A LOT OF
###1250 FLEXIBILITY AND STRENGTH. AND IT'S ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING
###1256 INTERTIDAL ORGANISMS. BUT OUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM
###1260 WE GET THESE KELPS GROWING IN WATER UP TO 200 FEET DEEP, SO IN
###1264 REALLY DEEP WATER. HERE YOU CAN SEE ONE OF OUR COASTAL FORESTS
###1269 OF KELP. AND THESE ARE KEYSTONE ORGANISMS ECOLOGICALLY. THEY
###1273 PROVIDE BASICALLY A FOREST-LIKE ENVIRONMENT OUT IN THE OCEAN THAT
###1278 PROVIDES COVER, YOU KNOW NURSERY GROUND, A FEEDING AREA FOR A
###1283 WIDE VARIETY OF VERTEBRATES AND INVERTEBRATES. SO THESE KELP
###1287 FOREST WE HAVE OFF OUR COAST ARE, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY ARE
###1292 FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THIS UNUSUAL ECOSYSTEM WE HAVE HERE ALONG
###1296 
###1296 OUR PACIFIC COAST. AND A LOT OF THESE BIG KELPS THAT ARE OUT IN
###1301 DEEP WATER, THEY HAVE FLOATS NEAR THEIR BLADES THAT SERVE TO BUOY
###1307 THEIR LEAVES OR THEIR BLADES UP IN THE UPPER WATER LAYERS WHERE
###1311 THEY'RE MORE IN CLOSER PROXIMITY TO OR THEY HAVE MORE
###1315 AVAILABILITY TO LIGHT. SO THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF INTERESTING
###1318 ADAPTATIONS THAT, FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF
###1322 ENVIRONMENTS. AND THEY'RE A REALLY DIVERSE GROUP BOTH ON OUR
###1325 COAST AND ELSEWHERE. OKAY, SO THOSE ARE THE BROWN ALGAE. FOR
###1333 THE RED ALGAE YOU MIGHT, YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THESE TOO.
###1338 THEY OFTEN WASH UP ON THE BEACH JUST LIKE THE BROWNS. AND WE
###1342 CAN FIND THEM FROM THE INTERTIDAL ZONE DOWN INTO MUCH DEEPER
###1346 WATER THAN WHERE WE FIND THE BROWN ALGAE. THESE GUYS CAN GET
###1349 INTO WATER THAT'S ALMOST A THOUSAND FEET DEEP, I MEAN WHERE LIGHT
###1352 CAN BARELY PENETRATE. SO THAT'S, THESE ARE REALLY EXTRAORDINARY
###1357 IN TERMS OF THEIR ECOLOGICAL RANGE IN THE OCEAN. AND WE FIND
###1361 THE MOST DIVERSITY OF THESE ONES IN THE, IN THE TROPICAL OCEANS,
###1365 BUT THEY'RE ALSO WELL-REPRESENTED ALONG OUR COAST, AND WE HAVE A
###1369 LOT OF DIVERSITY. THEY HAVE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX LIFE CYCLES.
###1372 AND I WON'T, WE WON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO TEACH YOU THE LIFE
###1376 CYCLES OF RED ALGAE BECAUSE THEY HAVE VARIOUS STAGES. IT'S,
###1379 THEY'RE REAL BRAIN TEASERS AS FAR AS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT
###1382 ALL WORKS. BUT THERE'S BIZARRE THINGS THAT HAPPEN. THERE'S
###1386 SOME RED ALGAE THAT ACTUALLY WILL PARASITIZE OTHER RED ALGAE.
###1391 THEY HAVE STRANGE ECOLOGY. BUT AS YOU GET INTO DEEPER WATER, UP
###1397 IN THE SHALLOW WATER, THEY TEND TO BE MORE GREENISH IN
###1402 
###1402 COLORATION, LIKE THE NORI THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH FROM
###1405 SUSHI, PORPHYRA WHICH IS HARVESTED FROM SHALLOW WATER AND IS USED
###1411 TO WRAP SUSHI IN JAPANESE CUISINE. AS YOU GET OUT INTO DEEPER
###1415 WATER, THEY TEND TO BE MORE REDDISH. AND THAT'S, THERE'S A GOOD
###1420 REASON FOR THAT REDDISHNESS AND THAT IS THAT WHEN YOU GET OUT
###1425 INTO DEEP WATER, HERE YOU CAN SEE THE DEGREE TO WHICH LIGHT
###1429 PENETRATES IN THE OCEAN AND BREAKING IT OUT BY THE DIFFERENT
###1434 COLORS OF LIGHT. AND WHEN YOU GET DOWN BELOW ABOUT 125 METERS
###1440 IN DEPTH, YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH JUST CAP-, YOU'RE JUST GETTING THE
###1443 PENETRATION OF BLUE AND GREEN LIGHT DOWN HERE. AND SO THIS IS,
###1447 THESE ARE THE WAVE LENGTHS THAT THESE ORGANISMS CAN UTILIZE WHEN
###1451 THEY'RE IN THE DEEPER WATER. AND SO THEY TEND TO, THEY HAVE
###1457 ACCESSORY PIGMENTS THAT APPEAR RED BECAUSE THEY'RE REFLECTING RED
###1461 LIGHT. THEY'RE NOT ABSORBING RED LIGHT, THEY'RE REFLECTING
###1464 IT. THEY'RE ABSORBING BLUES AND GREENS. AND THESE ARE
###1469 PHYCOERYTHRINS. THE NAME'S NOT IMPORTANT, BUT THERE ARE
###1471 ACCESSORY PIGMENTS IN THE PLASTIDS ALONG WITH THE CHLOROPHYL AND
###1475 THEY'RE MASKING THE CHLOROPHYL COLOR. CHLOROPHYL ALSO HAS A HIGH
###1481 ABSORPTION IN THE BLUE END OF THE SPECTRUM HERE, BUT ALSO IN THE
###1486 RED PART OF THE SPECTRUM AS YOU CAN SEE HERE. THE PHYCOERYTHRINS
###1492 ARE, HAVE THEIR ABSORPTION OF LIGHT UP IN THIS AREA, SO THEY
###1495 AUGMENT THAT AND LEAD TO A LOT MORE PHOTOSYNTHESIS THAN WOULD
###1500 OCCUR OTHERWISE AT THOSE DEEPER DEPTHS. SO THAT'S WHAT'S GOING
###1504 ON WITH THE RED ALGAE.
###1510 OKAY, SO FINALLY NOW THE GREEN ALGAE.
###1513 AND WE'RE GOING TO BASICALLY BE TALKING ABOUT GREEN ORGANISMS FOR
###1516 
###1516 THE REST OF THE COURSE. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF
###1520 THE OTHER GROUPS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT? OKAY. SO THE GREEN
###1528 ALGAE HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FORMS AND ULTRA-STRUCTURAL
###1535 MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ECOLOGI-, A
###1540 NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LIFE CYCLES AMONG THE GREEN ALGAE. IT'S A
###1543 REALLY DIVERSE GROUP. BUT THESE ALL SEEM TO STEM FROM THAT
###1546 PRIMARY ENDOSYMBIOSIS THAT INVOLVE THE CAPTURING OF THE
###1551 CYANOBACTERIUM. AND THEY DESCEND FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR WITH
###1554 THE RED ALGAE THAT ALSO DIVERGE FROM THAT COMMON ANCESTOR THAT
###1560 HAD ACQUIRED ITS PHOTOSYNTHETIC ABILITY FROM THAT PRIMARY
###1565 ENDOSYMBIOSIS. AND THEY RANGE FROM UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS LIKE
###1569 THE CHLAMYDOMONAS WHICH IS A MODEL ORGANISM HERE. YOU CAN SEE
###1576 THE TWO FLAGELLAE UP AT, AT THE APEX OF ITS CELLS HERE. THAT'S
###1581 AN SEM. IT'S ACTUALLY GREEN. IN THIS IT'S JUST IN BLACK AND
###1584 WHITE. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE COLONIAL GREEN ALGA, VOLVOX.
###1590 THESE VOLVACALEANS ARE REALLY COOL. THEY MOVE THROUGH THE WATER
###1593 AS A BIG SPHERICAL COLONY AND PRODUCE ADDITIONAL SPHERICAL
###1597 DAUGHTER COLONIES INSIDE. THE CELLS CAN LIVE SEPARATELY, BUT
###1602 THEY CAN'T REPRODUCE SEPARATELY, SO THESE ARE REAL TRUE COLONIAL
###1606 ORGANISMS. AND THEN WE HAVE MULTICELLULAR GREEN ALGAE LIKE THE
###1610 SEA LETTUCE HERE, ULVA, ONE OF THE SEAWEEDS. SO THERE ARE
###1615 SEAWEEDS AMONG THE GREEN ALGAE TOO. AND THEY OCCUR IN BOTH
###1619 FRESHWATER, I SHOULD SAY GREEN ALGAE OCCUR IN BOTH FRESHWATER AND
###1622 MARINE SITUATIONS, DIFFERENT TAXA. THEY ALSO OCCUR IN HIGH
###1627 ELEVATION SNOWFIELDS. AND IF YOU'VE BEEN HIKING UP IN THE HIGH
###1630 
###1630 SIERRA DURING THE SUMMER TIME AND YOU FIND, YOU SEE SOME
###1634 SNOWFIELD THAT LOOKS RED, THAT'S NOT SOME SORT OF AIR POLLUTION
###1640 OR SOMETHING THAT'S CAUSED THAT OR SOME SORT OF A POLLUTANT, BUT
###1644 IT'S ACTUALLY THIS ORGANISM, CHLAMYDOMONAS NIVALIS, WHICH IS A
###1648 CHLAMYDOMONAS LIKE THESE THAT HAS ACCESSORY RED PIGMENTS AND
###1654 WHICH IS WHAT WE CALL CRYOPHILIC. IT LOVES EXCEEDINGLY COLD
###1658 WATER, SO IT LIVES IN THE SNOW MELT FROM THE SNOW THERE. SO
###1662 THERE'S A HUGE ECOLOGICAL RANGE IN THESE THINGS, ACROSS THE GREEN
###1666 ALGAE THAT IS. OKAY, SO BEFORE GOING INTO THE ORIGIN OF LAND
###1673 PLANTS, I JUST WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THIS MAJOR TYPE OF LIFE
###1678 CYCLE THAT HAS A NICE REPRESENTATIVE IN THESE GUYS, THE ULVAS,
###1684 THE SEA LETTUCES. AND IT'S ALSO THE TYPE OF LIFE CYCLE WE SEE
###1688 IN ALL THE LAND PLANTS, EVERY ONE. BUT IT'S BEEN INDEPENDENTLY
###1694 EVOLVED IN THOSE TWO GROUPS AS I'LL POINT OUT IN A MINUTE. BUT
###1698 ULVA SHOWS THIS TYPE OF LIFE CYCLE WELL, SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT,
###1701 TALK ABOUT IT IN THIS CONTEXT FIRST. SO WE'VE ALREADY TALKED
###1707 ABOUT GAMETIC LIFE CYCLE WHERE THE GAMETE IS THE ONLY HAPLOID
###1713 STAGE, LIKE IN THE CASE OF US AND THE DIATOMS. AND WE TALKED
###1718 ABOUT A ZYGOTIC LIFE CYCLE AS IN THE FUNGI WHERE THE ZYGOTE IS
###1723 THE ONLY DIPLOID PHASE, THE ONLY DIPLOID STAGE. IN THOSE TWO
###1727 CASES MITOSIS IS ONLY OCCURRING IN ONE OF THE TWO STAGES.
###1732 WHEREAS IN AN ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS WE HAVE MITOSIS
###1735 OCCURRING IN BOTH THE HAPLOID STAGE AND THE DIPLOID STAGE. AND
###1742 THAT RESULTS IN SEPARATE MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS THAT ARE HAPLOID
###1747 AND THAT ARE DIPLOID IN THE SAME SPECIES. AND THESE DIFFERENT
###1752 
###1752 MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS, HAPLOID AND DIPLOID, ARE ALTERNATING
###1757 GENERATION AFTER GENERATION. THIS IS KIND OF A BIZARRE CONCEPT
###1761 THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF ORGANISMS IN
###1764 THE SAME SPECIES THAT DIFFER IN THEIR PLOIDY AND THEIR CHROMOSOME
###1768 NUMBER. AND ONE OF THEM, THE GAMETOPHYTE WHICH IS THE HAPLOID
###1776 ORGANISM -- PHYTE LITERALLY MEANS PLANT --  GAMETOPHYTE REFERS TO
###1783 THE GAMETE PRODUCING PLANT, OKAY, AND SINCE THIS IS A HAPLOID
###1788 ORGANISM, GAMETOPHYTES ARE ALWAYS HAPLOID, THAT MEANS THEY'RE
###1792 GOING TO BE PRODUCING THEIR GAMETES BY MITOSIS, NOT MEIOSIS LIKE
###1795 IN US. SO WE PRODUCE OUR GAMETES BY MEIOSIS. REMEMBER GAMETES
###1799 ARE HAPLOID. WE'RE DIPLOID. WE HAVE TO PRODUCE OUR GAMETES BY
###1803 MEIOSIS WHICH RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN THE CHROMOSOME CONT-, YOU
###1808 KNOW, IN HALVING OF THE GENOME CONTENT. BUT GAMETOPHYTES ARE
###1810 ALREADY HAPLOID. THEY, THEY GERMINATE DIRECTLY FROM SPORES,
###1815 HAPLOID SPORES. AND SO MITOSIS PRODUCE, PRODUCES GAMETES THAT
###1821 ARE GENETICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE PARENT GAMETOPHYTE. THOSE
###1827 GAMETES FUSE OF COURSE LIKE ANY FERTILIZATION EVENT. AND THEN
###1832 WE HAVE A ZYGOTE, NOT SHOWN HERE, BUT THERE'D BE A ZYGOTE, OF
###1835 COURSE. AND THEN THAT WOULD UNDERGO MITOSES TO GIVE RISE TO
###1840 WHAT'S CALLED THE SPOROPHYTE, WHICH MEANS LITERALLY THE
###1843 SPORE-PRODUCING PLANT, AND IT'S DIPLOID. SPOROPHYTES ARE ALWAYS
###1847 DIPLOID. THEY ALWAYS PRODUCE SPORES, NOT GAMETES. EVEN THOUGH
###1853 THEY'RE DIPLOID, THEY DON'T PRODUCE GAMETES. THEY PRODUCE SPORES
###1856 BY MEIOSIS. BUT THE IMPORTANT THING TO NOT TO GET CONFUSED ABOUT
###1860 HERE, YOU KNOW, WE THINK OF OURSELVES AS DIPLOID ORGANISMS
###1864 
###1864 UNDERGOING MEIOSIS TO PRODUCE GAMETES. THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS
###1867 IN LAND PLANTS OR IN SOME OF THE GREEN ALGAE. MEIOSIS GIVES RISE
###1872 TO SPORES. AND REMEMBER SPORES, UNLIKE GAMETES, THEY DON'T FUSE
###1876 TOGETHER WITH ONE ANOTHER. THEY JUST GERMINATE TO PRODUCE A NEW
###1879 ORGANISM, WHICH OF COURSE WOULD BE HAPLOID AFTER MEIOSIS. SO
###1884 THAT'S THE LIFE CYCLE. WE HAVE THIS MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM
###1888 THAT'S HAPLOID AS WELL AS THE MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM THAT'S
###1892 DIPLOID. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT? OKAY, LET'S LOOK
###1899 AT AN EXAMPLE NOW WITH ULVA. OH, SORRY.
###1904 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].
###1907 PROFESSOR: EXACTLY. IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS FERTILIZATION. I
###1911 DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE THIS SLIDE. IT'S FROM YOUR BOOK, BUT IF I
###1915 HAD WRITTEN IT, I WOULD HAVE WRITTEN FERTILIZATION THERE BECAUSE
###1917 EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT TERM. BUT SYNGAMY JUST MEANS FUSION OF
###1921 GAMETES. "SYN" JUST MEANS FUSION OR FUSE. AND "GAMY" IS,
###1927 REFERS TO GAMETES. THEY'RE IDENTICAL, THEY'RE SYNONYMOUS TERMS.
###1931 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].
###1935 PROFESSOR: WELL, YEAH, GOOD POINT. THIS, THIS LIFE CYCLE IN
###1939 ITS ESSENCE RIGHT HERE, THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE IS REALLY AN
###1943 IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE THIS REALLY BOILS IT DOWN TO ITS, TO THE
###1946 ESSENCE OF WHAT THE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS IS. THE ONLY
###1952 THING THAT'S NOT SHOWN HERE THAT REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED
###1954 WAS THE ZYGOTE AFTER SYNGAMY. BUT YOU KNOW I THINK JUST
###1958 REMEMBER THAT AFTER FERTILIZATION, YOU GET A ZYGOTE HERE. BUT
###1963 THIS IS THE LIFE CYCLE WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING THE REST OF THE
###1965 
###1965 SEMESTER. AND IT HAS VARIOUS EMBELLISHMENTS IN DIFFERENT
###1972 GROUPS. AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET THIS DOWN ASAP
###1979 AFTER THE EXAM TONIGHT, OF COURSE. I'M NOT GOING TO, YOU KNOW,
###1982 YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO CLOUD YOUR MIND WITH IT RIGHT NOW.
###1985 BUT AFTER THE EXAM, YOU KNOW, REALLY GET THIS DOWN BECAUSE I MEAN
###1990 IN TERMS OF THESE MAJOR COMPONENTS, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE
###1995 GOING TO BE LOOKING AT FROM NOW ON, OKAY. SO I JUST CAN'T
###1999 EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. AND THE REASON I WANT
###2004 TO SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE IN THE SEA LETTUCE, ULVA, IS BECAUSE THIS
###2008 IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS THAT THERE IS.
###2012 ESSENTIALLY EXACTLY LIKE THAT OTHER SLIDE I JUST SHOWED YOU.
###2018 AND WHY I SAY IT'S SIMPLE IS BECAUSE IT'S WHAT WE CALL AN ICE --
###2020 THIS TERM ISN'T IMPORTANT, BUT IT'S WHAT WE CALL AN ISOMORPHIC
###2024 ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS WHERE THE SPOROPHYTE AND THE
###2028 GAMETOPHYTE LOOK IDENTICAL. ISOMORPHIC, ISO MEANS THE SAME.
###2033 MORPHIC, THE SAME MORPHOLOGY FOR BOTH THE SPOROPHYTE AND THE
###2038 GAMETOPHYTE. THOUGH WE HAVE THE SPOROPHYTE HERE GIVING RISE
###2043 THROUGH MEIOSIS TO ZOOSPORES. THESE ARE ACTUALLY MOTILE SPORES,
###2048 BUT THEY DON'T FUSE TOGETHER. THEY'RE NOT GAMETES. THEY JUST
###2052 UNDERGO MITOSES AND END UP DEVELOPING INTO A HAPLOID GAMETOPHYTE.
###2058 HAPLOID GAMETOPHYTE PRODUCES HAPLOID GAMETES BY MITOSIS. THESE
###2062 ARE GENETICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE HAPLOID GAMETOPHYTE. AND THEN
###2067 THEY FUSE TOGETHER TO PRODUCE THE ZYGOTE. AND THAT ZYGOTE THEN
###2071 AFTER MITOSES AND DEVELOPMENT, BECOMES A DIPLOID SPOROPHYTE. SO
###2076 THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY TELL THESE APART IS IF YOU DID A
###2079 
###2079 CHROMOSOME COUNT. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS HAS TWICE AS MANY
###2083 CHROMOSOMES AS THIS DOES, THESE TWO GENERATIONS. ALSO IF YOU
###2087 LOOKED AT THEIR REPRODUCTIVE STRUCTURES, THIS IS PRODUCING
###2091 SPORANGIA WHICH ARE HOLLOW SACS THAT PRODUCE SPORES BY
###2097 DEFINITION. AND THIS, THE GAMETOPHYTE PRODUCES GAMETANGIA WHICH
###2104 ARE BASICALLY HOLLOW SACS THAT PRODUCE GAMETES. SO THAT'S THE
###2109 REAL DIFFERENCE. BUT THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT TO GO ON THERE.
###2112 SO THIS IS A REALLY BEAUTIFUL CASE OF A, OF AN ALTERNATION OF
###2117 GENERATIONS WHERE THE TWO PHASES OF THE LIFE CYCLE, WE CALL IT
###2121 THE SPOROPHYTE OR DIPLOID PHASE AND THE GAMETOPHYTE OR HAPLOID
###2126 PHASE ARE, ARE VERY, VERY SIMILAR. YEAH?
###2131 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
###2134 PROFESSOR: YEAH, THESE ARE FREE LIVING FROM ONE ANOTHER. BUT
###2137 THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT BECAUSE WE'LL SEE LATER IN THE LAND
###2141 PLANTS THAT IT'S OFTEN THE CASE THAT THE GAMETOPHYTE OR THE
###2145 SPOROPHYTE IS DEPENDENT ON, ON ITS IMMEDIATE PARENT. SO WE'LL
###2150 SEE PARASITISM BY ONE GENERATION ON ANOTHER GENERATION IN A LOT
###2154 OF CASES. OKAY, SO AS FAR AS ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF ALGAE, I'VE
###2161 ALREADY MENTIONED DIATOMS AND DIATOMACEOUS EARTH. BUT THERE'S
###2164 SOME REALLY IMPORTANT COMPOUNDS THAT ARE HARVESTED FROM BROWN
###2169 ALGAE AND RED ALGAE IN PARTICULAR. AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE
###2172 WORTH MENTIONING. I ALREADY MENTIONED, WELL, THERE ARE A LARGE
###2175 NUMBER OF DIFFERENT RED AND BROWN ALGAE THAT ARE HARVESTED AS
###2178 EDIBLE SEAWEEDS USED EXTENSIVELY IN ASIAN CUISINE. WE CAN'T
###2183 REALLY, WE CAN'T DIGEST THOSE CARBOHYDRATES, BUT THEY'RE A GOOD
###2188 
###2188 SOURCE OF MINERALS, ROUGHAGE, ET CETERA. AND ALSO THIS IS A RED
###2194 ALGA ACTUALLY, NORI, THE ONE YOU'RE PROBABLY THE MOST FAMILIAR
###2196 WITH. BUT THERE ARE BROWNS AS WELL THAT ARE USED IN JAPANESE
###2200 CUISINE FOR EXAMPLE. ANOTHER COMPOUND HARVESTED FROM RED ALGA
###2206 IS AGAR. AND AGAR OF COURSE IS USED FOR BACTER-, FOR MICROBIAL
###2211 CULTURING IN PETRI DISHES. YOU KNOW THIS IS OUR TYPICAL
###2215 CULTURING MEDIUM IN SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OF MICROBES AND MOLECULAR
###2220 BIOLOGY. AND AGAROSE, A REFINED PRODUCT THERE, IS USED IN
###2224 ELECTROPHORESIS. SO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SEPARATE OUT DNA
###2229 MOLECULES OF DIFFERENT SIZES, AGAROSE IS GENERALLY THE MEDIUM
###2234 THAT'S USED FOR GEL ELECTROPHORESIS FOR LARGE FRAGMENTS, NOT IN
###2241 DNA SEQUENCING WHERE YOU USE ACRYLAMIDE, BUT FOR, FOR LARGER
###2245 FRAGMENTS AGAROSE IS OFTEN USED. SO THESE, FOR MICROBIOLOGY AND
###2249 MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, RED ALGAE HAVE PROVEN TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT.
###2254 AND THEN THE BROWN ALGAE ARE SOURCES OF THINGS LIKE
###2259 POLYSACCHARIDES, THESE MUCILAGINOUS POLYSACCHARIDES LIKE
###2262 CARRAGEENAN AND ALGINATE THAT ARE USED AS THICKENING AGENTS OR
###2269 EMULSIFYING AGENTS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF DRINKS
###2272 AND FOODS. YOU'RE CONSTANTLY INGESTING ALGINATE AND CARRAGEENAN
###2278 IN PROCESSED FOODS. IT'S INCLUDED IN ALL KINDS OF THINGS. I
###2282 MEAN EVEN IN BEER, TO STABILIZE THE HEAD OF BEERS, IN A LOT OF
###2286 BEERS ALGINATE IS USED. IT'S PUT IN ICE CREAM TO KEEP IT FROM
###2292 MELTING AS QUICKLY AS IT WOULD OTHERWISE. I MEAN THERE'S A LOT
###2296 OF USES THAT YOU, THAT SPAN MUCH OF WHAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED IN
###2300 OUR FOOD THAT COMES FROM BROWN ALGAE. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE AN
###2304 
###2304 EXAMPLE IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION OF ALGINATE BEING USED AS THE
###2308 MAIN MEDIUM FOR DENTAL IMPRESSIONS. SO THESE ARE REALLY
###2312 IMPORTANT SUBSTANCES THAT ARE USED IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS.
###2320 OKAY, SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THE ORIGIN OF LAND PLANTS.
###2324 AND THIS SEGUES DIRECTLY FROM ALGAE BECAUSE THE GREEN ALGAE AS
###2330 YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS TREE HERE, HERE ARE THE LAND PLANTS, THE
###2334 GREEN ALGAE ARE A PARAPHYLETIC GROUP. THOUGH THE GREEN ALGAE
###2339 DON'T FORM A CLADE BY THEMSELVES. SOME GREEN ALGAE, EXAMPLES
###2347 SHOWN HERE, ARE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO LAND PLANTS THAN THEY ARE
###2351 TO OTHER GREEN ALGAE. THOUGH THE SEA LETTUCE AND SOME OF THESE
###2357 MARINE ALGAE OR THE MARINE ALGAE IN GENERAL ARE PRETTY DISTANTLY
###2362 RELATED TO LAND PLANTS. AND THE CLOSEST RELATIVES OF LAND
###2368 PLANTS TURN OUT TO BE FRESHWATER ALGAE, FRESHWATER GREEN ALGAE.
###2372 SO THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT FROM THESE RESULTS, WHICH COME BOTH
###2376 FROM MORPHOLOGICAL DATA, MOSTLY ULTRASTRUCTURAL CHARACTERS REALLY
###2380 YOU CAN'T SEE WITH YOUR NAKED EYE, AND MOLECULAR DATA, IS THAT
###2387 THE LAND PLANTS EVOLVE FROM FRESHWATER HABITATS. SO THIS
###2394 CONCEPTION OF PLANTS HAVING INVADED LAND FROM THE OCEAN IS
###2397 MISCONSTRUED BASED ON AT LEAST THE MODERN DIVERSITY. ALL OF THE
###2402 GREEN ALGAE THAT WE KNOW OF THAT FALL OUT IN THIS CLADE THAT'S
###2406 SISTER TO THE LAND PLANTS OCCUR IN FRESHWATER. SO THE ANCESTOR
###2412 OF LAND PLANTS HAD TO FIRST INVADE FRESHWATER IN THE CONTINENTAL
###2417 SETTING. AND THEN FROM THERE, THEY INVADED TERRESTRIAL
###2424 HABITATS. AND IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. I MEAN THAT'S, THAT
###2426 SORT OF TRANSITION WOULD, WOULD MAKE ECOLOGICAL SENSE. AND THIS
###2432 
###2432 IS SOMETHING THAT'S PRETTY NOW WELL ESTABLISHED. NOW THAT THE
###2435 MOLECULAR DATA IS AVAILABLE, PEOPLE HAVE GONE IN AND LOOKED AT
###2437 THE MORPHOLOGY MORE CLOSELY. AND THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF
###2440 FEATURES THAT ARE IN YOUR TEXTBOOK YOU CAN LOOK AT, LOOK IT UP IF
###2443 YOU'D LIKE. ONE OF MOST INTERESTING ONES, I'LL GET TO THAT IN A
###2449 MOMENT ACTUALLY. BUT ANYWAYS, THE THING THAT'S COME OUT OF THIS
###2452 IS THAT WE REALLY CAN'T HAVE A PHYLUM CALLED GREEN ALGAE, YOU
###2457 KNOW, THAT DOESN'T, DOESN'T WORK SINCE THEY'RE PARAPHYLETIC.
###2462 THE LAND PLANTS APPEAR TO BE MONOPHYLETIC. AND THESE FRESHWATER
###2466 GREEN ALGAE THAT ARE CLOSE RELATIVES ARE MONOPHYLETIC. THESE
###2469 TAKEN TOGETHER ARE MONOPHYLETIC GROUPS, SOMETIMES CALLED THE
###2473 STREPTOPHYTES. AND ALL OF THE GREEN PLANTS, ALL THE GREEN
###2479 ORGANISMS NOW ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO BY BOTANISTS AS THE GREEN
###2483 PLANTS. SO THE GREEN ALGAE PLUS THE LAND PLANTS TOGETHER THEY
###2487 MAKE UP ONE BIG MONOPHYLETIC GROUP OF GREEN ORGANISMS. AND
###2492 THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL OFTEN SEE REFERRED TO AS THE GREEN PLANTS OR
###2496 VIRIDIPLANTAE. OKAY, SO ARE THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT? WELL,
###2503 HERE'S WHAT ONE OF THOSE, OH, SORRY, SO HERE WE GO ON TO LAND.
###2507 AND HERE'S ONE OF THOSE FRESHWATER GREEN ALGAE. THIS IS THE
###2512 GENUS CHARA THAT THE, THE PHYLUM IS NAMED FOR, THE CHAROPHYTES
###2517 THAT ARE THE CLOSES RELATIVES OF LAND PLANTS LIKE MOSSES. AGAIN
###2522 FRESHWATER. THESE HAVE A LIFE CYCLE THAT IS NOT AN ALTERNATION
###2526 OF GENERATIONS. THESE CHAROPHYTES, THE ONLY DIPLOID STAGE IN
###2532 THESE CHAROPHYTES IS THE ZYGOTE. SO THEY'RE MORE LIKE FUNGI IN
###2537 THAT SENSE. THEY UNDERGO MEIOSIS IMMEDIATELY AFTER
###2541 
###2541 FERTILIZATION. THOUGH THE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS WAS NOT
###2546 PRESENT IN THE CLOSEST, IN THE AQUATIC ANCESTORS OF LAND PLANTS,
###2551 BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT APPEARS TO HAVE EVOLVED SUBSEQUENTLY.
###2557 BUT WE HAVE AN ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS IN ALL THE LAND PLANTS
###2559 LIKE THE MOSSES. OKAY, SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT TO CONSIDER.
###2566 AND THESE CHAROPHYTES INCLUDE UNICELLULAR AS WELL AS
###2570 MULTICELLULAR THINGS LIKE THIS. SO THE MULTICELLULAR CONDITION
###2575 MAY BE INDEPENDENTLY DERIVED AS WELL IN THE LAND PLANTS. BRAD?
###2580 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].
###2587 PROFESSOR: THE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS THAT WE SEE IN
###2592 SOMETHING LIKE ULVA, THE SEA LETTUCE, PROBABLY EVOLVED
###2596 SEPARATELY. SO THE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS WE SEE IN LAND
###2600 PLANTS IS PROBABLY OF SEPARATE ORIGIN. AND YOU CAN SEE IT, I'LL
###2603 SHOW YOU AS WE GO THROUGH HERE THAT WE HAVE A REALLY NICE
###2605 PROGRESSION IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE SPOROPHYTE GENERATION. SO
###2612 BASICALLY THE, THE MAIN ADULT BODY OF A CHAROPHYTE WAS HAPLOID.
###2618 AND WHAT WE SEE IN THE MOSSES AND THE OTHER PLANTS WE CALL
###2622 BRYOPHYTES, WHICH ARE THIS PART OF THE TREE OF LAND PLANTS,
###2629 THESE ARE ALL THE LAND PLANTS HERE, THE BRYOPHYTES HERE, THEIR
###2634 MAIN REPRO-, THEIR MAIN VEGETATIVE BODY THAT'S PHYTOSYNTHETIC, OR
###2638 THE MAIN PHOTOSYNTHESIS AT LEAST THAT GOES ON IN THEM, IS THE
###2642 GAMETOPHYTE IS THE HAPLOID GENERATION. AND THE DIPLOID PHASE IS
###2649 VERY REDUCED. I SHOULDN'T SAY IT'S REDUCED. IT'S VERY SMALL.
###2653 THESE THINGS PROBABLY, THE LAND PLANTS PROB-, EVOLVED FROM AN
###2657 ANCESTOR THAT PROBABLY LACKED ANY SPOROPHYTE PHASE, A DIPLOID
###2662 
###2662 PHASE. AND SO WE SEE VERY, VERY SMALL LITTLE SPOROPHYTES IN
###2668 THESE. AND WHAT WE'LL SEE AS WE GO THROUGH HERE IS THAT THE
###2671 SPOROPHYTE GETS PROGRESSIVELY MORE COMPLEX AND IMPORTANT IN THE
###2675 LIFE CYCLE. THAT'S A THEME IN THE LAND PLANTS THAT WE START OUT
###2680 WITH THE GAMETOPHYTE, THE HAPLOID GENERATION BEING DOMINANT AND
###2684 EVENTUALLY THE DIPLOID SPOROPHYTE GENERATION BECOMES DOMINANT IN
###2687 THE LAND, IN THE VASCULAR PLANTS, WHICH ARE THE PLANTS THAT WE
###2690 SEE MOSTLY AROUND US THAT HAVE, THAT ARE BIG AND HAVE MAJOR
###2693 CONDUCTING TISSUE. BUT THE BRYOPHYTES INCLUDE THE MOSSES, THE
###2701 HORNWORTS, AND THE LIVERWORTS. AND THE ENDING WORT, W-O-R-T,
###2707 JUST MEANS HERB. IT DOESN'T MEAN SOME SORT OF, SOME SORT OF,
###2714 YOU KNOW, LITTLE CARBUNCLE OR SOMETHING ON THESE THINGS. THESE
###2716 THINGS HAVE, WORT IS JUST AN ENGLISH TERM FOR A HERB AS OPPOSED
###2721 TO A WOODY PLANT. OKAY, SO THERE ARE THREE MAJOR GROUPS OF
###2725 BRYOPHYTES AS THEY'RE CALLED. AND THE BRYOPHYTES APPEAR TO BE
###2729 PARAPHYLETIC. WE WERE JUST SEEING HOW THE GREEN ALGAE LOOKED
###2733 PARAPHYLETIC RELATIVE TO THE LAND PLANTS. THE BRYOPHYTES ARE
###2739 PARAPHYLETIC RELATIVE TO THE VASCULAR PLANTS, OKAY. AND THE
###2744 VASCULAR PLANTS INCLUDE THE FERNS, THE, ALL THE SEED PLANTS, THE
###2752 CLUB MOSSES AND SPIKE MOSSES AND QUILLWORTS. THESE ARE
###2754 BASICALLY ALL THE REALLY CONSPICUOUS PLANTS THAT YOU SEE OUT IN
###2757 THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THE MOSSES, THE HORNWORTS AND LIVERWORTS,
###2761 ARE VERY SMALL PLANTS. THEY RARELY GET OVER 15 CENTIMETERS IN
###2765 HEIGHT, YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY
###2769 DON'T HAVE THE SORT OF HIGHLY REINFORCED CONDUCTING TISSUE THAT
###2774 
###2774 ALLOWS THEM TO RETAIN LARGE SIZES. BUT THEY'RE, ANYWAYS,
###2780 THEY'RE THREE DISTINCT GROUPS THAT HAD ALREADY STARTED TO
###2784 DIVERSIFY INTO THESE MAJOR LINEAGES BEFORE THE VASCULAR PLANTS
###2789 ORIGINATED. AND WE COULD REALLY SAY ESSENTIALLY THAT THE
###2794 BRYOPHYTES GAVE RISE TO THE VASCULAR PLANTS, THESE LARGER PLANTS
###2798 THAT HAVE CONDUCTING TISSUE, GIVEN THAT THEY CONSTITUTE A GRADE
###2802 OR PARAPHYLETIC GROUP WITHIN WHICH THE VASCULAR PLANTS ARE
###2805 NESTED. ARE THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT? YEAH, BRAD?
###2812 STUDENT: SO IF THE BRYOPHYTES DON'T HAVE THAT  -- (INAUDIBLE).
###2819 PROFESSOR: YEAH, THEY, THE LIVERWORTS, I SHOULD SAY THE MOSSES
###2821 ACTUALLY DO HAVE SOME CONDUCTING TISSUE. AND THEY'RE THE ONLY
###2825 MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP THAT CAN GET FAIRLY SIZEABLE. THERE ARE,
###2828 IN FACT, SOME MOSSES THAT CAN GET UP TO A COUPLE METERS IN
###2831 HEIGHT, AND THEY HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED LEPTOIDS AND HYDROIDS.
###2835 THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT, BUT THEY HAVE SOME CONDUCTING CELLS THAT
###2838 MOVE AROUND WATER AS WELL AS NUTRIENTS IN THEIR TISSUES. BUT IT
###2843 ISN'T REINFORCED BY LIGNIN WHICH IS THE CASE IN, THAT WAS WHAT WE
###2848 SEE IN THE VASCULAR TISSUE OF VASCULAR PLANTS. AND LIGNIN
###2852 IMPARTS GREAT STRENGTH TO THE CONDUCTING TISSUE, IN PARTICULAR
###2856 THE XYLEM, THE WATER CONDUCTING TISSUE. IT ALLOWS VASCULAR
###2861 PLANTS TO GET, TO BE LARGE BRANCHED SPOROPHYTES, TO HAVE LARGE
###2864 BRANCHED SPOROPHYTES. HORNWORTS AND LIVERWORTS DON'T HAVE THOSE
###2870 LEPTOIDS AND HYDROIDS, AND THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH AS I'LL SHOW YOU
###2873 HERE, WELL, LET'S GO TO THE LIFE CYCLE FIRST OF BRYOPHYTES TO
###2878 MAKE THIS POINT. AND I AM NOT SO SURE I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO
###2883 
###2883 GET THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE OF BRYOPHYTES IN THREE MINUTES, OR TWO
###2885 MINUTES. BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE POINT FIRST, AND WE'LL GET
###2889 BACK TO THIS NEXT TIME, BUT AS I WAS SAYING, THE GAMETOPHYTE, THE
###2894 HAPLOID PHASE OF BRYOPHYTES IS THE GREEN PHOTOSYNTHETIC DOMINANT
###2901 PHASE. AND YOU CAN SEE A TYPICAL MOSS GAMETOPHYTE RIGHT HERE.
###2907 AND AGAIN, IT'S GERMINATING FROM SPORES. IT HAS A FILAMENTOUS
###2912 FORM EARLY ITS DEVELOPMENT AND THEN GETS TO BE MORE OF
###2915 LEAFY-LIKE, HAS A, LOOKS LIKE A LEAFY STEM. BUT THIS IS A
###2919 GAMETOPHYTE NOT A SPOROPHYTE. SO THE, THE STRUCTURES THAT LOOK
###2923 LIKE LEAVES ARE NOT TRULY HOMOLOGOUS TO THE LEAVES WE SEE IN LAND
###2927 PLANTS THAT ARE IN THE SPOROPHYTE GENERATION. BUT IN ANY CASE,
###2931 THIS IS A GAMETOPHYTE. AND THEN IT PRODUCES GAMETANGIA UP IN THE
###2936 TIPS HERE. AND WE'LL GET TO THE GAMETANGIA LATER. BUT
###2942 BASICALLY THE SPOROPHYTE IS JUST THIS STRUCTURE HERE. IT'S
###2945 PARASITIC ON THE GAMETOPHYTE. IT GROWS OUT OF IT. AND IT'S
###2949 PRETTY MUCH JUST A SPORANGIUM ON A STALK. THOUGH WE HAVE A
###2953 HIGHLY REDUCED OR I SHOULD SAY A SMALL SPOROPHYTE WHERE WE HAVE
###2961 MEIOSIS GIVING RISE TO SPORES. SO THIS IS JUST AN INTRO TO THE
###2966 BRYOPHYTE LIFE CYCLE. AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT IT NEXT TIME.
###2970 SO REMEMBER TO SET YOUR CLOCK, CLOCKS BACK AGAIN. AND GOOD LUCK
###2975 ON THE EXAM TONIGHT.
###2976
