###2 JACOB SOBOROFF: Hey, it's Jacob.
###3 Coming up, we got an exclusive from Red Bull.
###5 And the one and only Tay Zonday is right here in the house.
###7 But first, I have to tell you, my dream
###9 of riding the hoverboard from "Back to the Future II"
###11 is finally becoming a reality.
###12 This is from a couple of days ago.
###14 And it is still one of the biggest videos today.
###16 It's got Christopher Lloyd, AKA Doc Brown,
###18 unveiling the world's first working hoverboard.
###20 TONY HAWK: I can't believe how well it works.
###22 I didn't think it'd be that smooth.
###23 You know, it always looked, in the movies,
###25 like it was just awkward.
###26 It was going sideways.
###27 And once I got on it, it felt natural.
###29 MOBY: It's intuitive.
###29 Like, the moment you start riding it, you know what to do.
###32 JACOB SOBOROFF: It's magnificent.
###33 It's wonderful.
###34 It's a hoax.
###35 [IMITATES BUZZER]
###36 Yesterday our darkest fears were confirmed.
###38 TONY HAWK: I want to apologize for the hoverboard prank.
###41 I wish as much as you do that hoverboards were real.
###43 And I'm sure that one day they will be.
###45 But until then, we still need roads.
###47 JACOB SOBOROFF: Be honest, were you fooled?
###49 We put together a great playlist for you
###50 after the show of some of the best fake ads
###52 and hoaxes on the web.
###53 LIZZIE: We've all been watching the events
###55 in Ukraine unfold for the last few months.
###57 And the situation is overwhelmingly complex.
###59 Thankfully, John Green was put on this earth
###61 to explain every major crisis.
###63 The VlogBrothers just posted this comprehensive history
###65 of the Ukrainian conflict dating all the way back
###68 to the 19th century.
###69 JOHN GREEN: In 2004, there was an election.
###71 And there were widespread reports of vote rigging,
###73 but the Russian-friendly Viktor Yanukovych was elected.
###76 The opposition leader, Viktor Yushchenko
###78 led massive street protests in Kiev
###81 that came to be known as the Orange Revolution.
###83 The arc of history is long, Hank.
###84 Let's hope that it bends toward peace.
###87 LIZZIE: Seriously, watch the whole thing.
###88 It's only seven minutes.
###89 And share it if you can.
###90 It's so important to understand why
###92 this is all happening right now.
###94 JACOB SOBOROFF: Julian Smith has been
###96 called the Monty Python of YouTube.
###97 And even though he only posts about once a month, his videos,
###99 I'm telling you, are always worth the wait.
###101 [MUSIC - JULIAN SMITH, "CAR  PHONE!"]
###103 
###121 Julian has more than 100 high-quality, high-concept
###123 videos on his channel.
###124 Get into it.
###126 MILES: Whatever.
###127 As if.
###128 How could anyone forget "Clueless"?
###129 The video for Australian rapper Iggy Azalea's new single,
###132 "Fancy", has her teaming up with UK artist Charli XCX
###135 to pay homage to the hit '90s film.

###139 
###150 Iggy even included 250 of her fans
###153 in the production as extras.
###154 The attention to detail in this video is ridiculous.
###156 That's probably why it already has over 2 million views
###159 in just a couple days.
###160 Side note, I met Iggy once.
###161 But don't worry, I played it cool.
###165 JACOB SOBOROFF: Who's Jamie O'Brien?
###166 Only one of the biggest freesurfing
###168 badasses I have ever seen.
###169 And we have an exclusive look at his new reality web series.
###172 It launches tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM.
###173 And besides some awesome surfing,
###175 you can watch as Jamie, once again, tortures his buddy
###177 Poopies.
###178 I'm not sure that's his given name.
###179 POOPIES: I'm scared.
###180 JAMIE O'BRIEN: That looks like a life jacket
###182 you get on the snorkeling boat.
###183 
###189 JACOB SOBOROFF: Prepare yourself by watching past seasons
###191 on Red Bull's channel right now.
###192 I promise you, it is much safer than paddling
###194 into some of these waves.
###197 TAY ZONDAY: I'm Tay Zonday.
###198 And I'm here to take you back to April 22, 2007, when
###202 I uploaded the video "Chocolate Rain".
###205 [MUSIC - TAY ZONDAY, "CHOCOLATE  RAIN"]
###206 
###215 The video sat around for about three months.
###218 Then someone posted it on Digg.
###219 It got picked up on 4chan.
###221 And boom, I ended up on "Jimmy Kimmel."
###223 I did a big ad with Dr. Pepper.
###224 It was a national news story.
###225 [MUSIC - TAY ZONDAY, "CHERRY  CHOCOLATE RAIN"]
###227 
###231 I make tons of videos.
###232 I'm still doing original music.
###233 You can check it out on my channel.
###235 The best thing to come out of "Chocolate Rain"
###237 for me are the stories and hearing that perhaps I
###239 was a small part of making people's days a little bit
###242 brighter.
###242 And that's very touching.
###245 JACOB SOBOROFF: No YouTube experience
###247 is complete without a little Tay Zonday.
###248 You guys have a favorite throwback video?
###250 Let us know using the hashtag #YouTubenation.
###252 Now play us out, The Chainsmokers.
