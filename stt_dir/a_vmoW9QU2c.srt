1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,742



2
0:0:2,742 --> 0:0:4,286
GRIME: Quality.


3
0:0:4,286 --> 0:0:6,816
Put it on large.


4
0:0:6,816 --> 0:0:7,675
-What was it on before?


5
0:0:7,675 --> 0:0:9,22
GRIME: I put it on small, man.


6
0:0:9,22 --> 0:0:11,293
Because I was taking photos of
shit that didn't matter.


7
0:0:11,293 --> 0:0:13,13
You got to pay attention
to that stuff.


8
0:0:13,13 --> 0:0:15,96



9
0:0:15,96 --> 0:0:16,87
All right, [INAUDIBLE].


10
0:0:16,87 --> 0:0:17,13
-Ready?


11
0:0:17,13 --> 0:0:18,166
GRIME: Yeah, man.


12
0:0:18,166 --> 0:0:20,195
Let's put some stencil on you.


13
0:0:20,195 --> 0:0:26,815



14
0:0:26,815 --> 0:0:30,3
God, I really tweaked out
on that little city.


15
0:0:30,3 --> 0:0:33,63
Fuck, it's like way nicer
than I thought.


16
0:0:33,63 --> 0:0:36,768
I can't believe I have to
fucking match that.


17
0:0:36,768 --> 0:0:40,526
Fuck, why did I do that?


18
0:0:40,526 --> 0:0:41,9
It's way too much work.


19
0:0:41,9 --> 0:0:44,77



20
0:0:44,77 --> 0:0:48,656
Shit, shit, shit, shit.


21
0:0:48,656 --> 0:0:51,4
Did I really do it that it
looks that good somehow?


22
0:0:51,4 --> 0:0:52,83
It looks that good?


23
0:0:52,83 --> 0:0:55,54
And why did I put that
much work into it?


24
0:0:55,54 --> 0:0:56,79
Now I have to do it again.


25
0:0:56,79 --> 0:1:0,8



26
0:1:0,8 --> 0:1:1,82
I can do it again though.


27
0:1:1,82 --> 0:1:4,27
I can do it again.


28
0:1:4,27 --> 0:1:5,52
I can manage it.


29
0:1:5,52 --> 0:1:10,65



30
0:1:10,65 --> 0:1:14,94
CIV: When you're dealing with
people who are their harshest


31
0:1:14,94 --> 0:1:18,59
critics, the work's going
to be amazing.


32
0:1:18,59 --> 0:1:21,74
And I think Grime's been
pushing himself


33
0:1:21,74 --> 0:1:24,532
so hard for so long.


34
0:1:24,532 --> 0:1:26,937
We spoke about it
a long time ago.


35
0:1:26,937 --> 0:1:30,35
And I said to him, do you think
if you didn't have the


36
0:1:30,35 --> 0:1:34,6
accident when you were a kid
that you would push yourself


37
0:1:34,6 --> 0:1:35,48
as hard as you do?


38
0:1:35,48 --> 0:1:40,5
Are you trying to prove
something because of the burns


39
0:1:40,5 --> 0:1:41,67
and because of the accident?


40
0:1:41,67 --> 0:1:44,61
And he's like, of course I am.


41
0:1:44,61 --> 0:1:50,35
I make myself push myself more
because of what happened.


42
0:1:50,35 --> 0:1:55,44
And he's super honest about it
and that made sense to me.


43
0:1:55,44 --> 0:2:2,31
No one is going to be able to
work as hard as him unless


44
0:2:2,31 --> 0:2:4,94
they're him.


45
0:2:4,94 --> 0:2:7,28
And I'm not speaking for
him, this is my own


46
0:2:7,28 --> 0:2:9,389
perception of it.


47
0:2:9,389 --> 0:2:12,91
You don't have this insane
hurdle that he


48
0:2:12,91 --> 0:2:14,46
deals with every day.


49
0:2:14,46 --> 0:2:17,38
So the way he gets over that
hurdle is by crushing


50
0:2:17,38 --> 0:2:18,63
everybody in tattooing.


51
0:2:18,63 --> 0:2:37,147



52
0:2:37,147 --> 0:2:39,56
GRIME: I don't think there's a
lot of difference between my


53
0:2:39,56 --> 0:2:42,88
work and a lot of people's work
besides I think I'm able


54
0:2:42,88 --> 0:2:47,654
to get my personality through
in a lot of my work.


55
0:2:47,654 --> 0:2:49,83
They probably think
I'm kind of crazy.


56
0:2:49,83 --> 0:2:52,195
That's probably what I think.


57
0:2:52,195 --> 0:2:54,97
CHRIS O'DONNELL: Everybody
across the board has complete


58
0:2:54,97 --> 0:2:55,98
respect for Grime.


59
0:2:55,98 --> 0:2:59,1
Whether you love his style, or
just kind of like it, or don't


60
0:2:59,1 --> 0:3:1,51
like it all, you can
appreciate the work


61
0:3:1,51 --> 0:3:3,13
that went into it.


62
0:3:3,13 --> 0:3:6,7
GRIME: There's only so much that
I could seek for outside


63
0:3:6,7 --> 0:3:6,39
[INAUDIBLE].


64
0:3:6,39 --> 0:3:9,41
I'm not so insecure that I'm
going to get rattled by some


65
0:3:9,41 --> 0:3:12,16
people going I don't know.


66
0:3:12,16 --> 0:3:15,5
I don't know if he's
that good, or I


67
0:3:15,5 --> 0:3:17,17
don't like his tattoos.


68
0:3:17,17 --> 0:3:21,74
Not to say if everybody in the
world thinks my tattoos suck


69
0:3:21,74 --> 0:3:23,63
and I think they're great, I'm
going to be walking around


70
0:3:23,63 --> 0:3:26,55
thinking I'm king shit
of turd island.


71
0:3:26,55 --> 0:3:32,15
But if I can get reward out of
it, then for me then it's


72
0:3:32,15 --> 0:3:33,4
nice, you know?


73
0:3:33,4 --> 0:3:58,116



74
0:3:58,116 --> 0:4:0,92
HENRY LEWIS: We have people
coming from all over the world


75
0:4:0,92 --> 0:4:3,83
mainly to see Grime, because
that's his spot.


76
0:4:3,83 --> 0:4:6,63
And the guy's been consistent
ever since I've met him.


77
0:4:6,63 --> 0:4:8,27
He's always been a
cool cat and he's


78
0:4:8,27 --> 0:4:9,2
always spoke his mind.


79
0:4:9,2 --> 0:4:14,5
But he hasn't been Mr. Tattoo
Ego Tattatude guy, so I


80
0:4:14,5 --> 0:4:16,516
appreciate that.


81
0:4:16,516 --> 0:4:19,212
-What is the name
of your shop?


82
0:4:19,212 --> 0:4:21,692
GRIME: Skull and Sword.


83
0:4:21,692 --> 0:4:23,73
-Who works there?


84
0:4:23,73 --> 0:4:31,795
GRIME: Me, Yutaro Sakai,
Henry Lewis, and Lango.


85
0:4:31,795 --> 0:4:34,89
They seek, I think, along
the same lines as I do.


86
0:4:34,89 --> 0:4:37,53
They're not trying to
be on a TV show,


87
0:4:37,53 --> 0:4:42,5
or be fucking whatever.


88
0:4:42,5 --> 0:4:43,56
They're trying to do work.


89
0:4:43,56 --> 0:4:44,72
They want to improve
their work-- that's


90
0:4:44,72 --> 0:4:46,8
important to them.


91
0:4:46,8 --> 0:4:50,82
They're not interested in being
a famous tattoo person.


92
0:4:50,82 --> 0:4:53,97
They seek satisfaction
from the work itself.


93
0:4:53,97 --> 0:4:56,23
HENRY LEWIS: Every day is like
there's something new to be


94
0:4:56,23 --> 0:4:58,91
learned from anyone.


95
0:4:58,91 --> 0:5:2,21
It's funny, we have this dynamic
in the shop where


96
0:5:2,21 --> 0:5:4,47
Grime and Yutaro are the
older cats and on the


97
0:5:4,47 --> 0:5:6,28
more technical side.


98
0:5:6,28 --> 0:5:8,35
And they're a little quieter
than we are.


99
0:5:8,35 --> 0:5:11,48
And then Lango and I, we
control the back room.


100
0:5:11,48 --> 0:5:14,38
We're a little loud and mad--


101
0:5:14,38 --> 0:5:15,63
personally expressive.


102
0:5:15,63 --> 0:5:18,2



103
0:5:18,2 --> 0:5:21,2
But that dynamic in the shop
just works really well with


104
0:5:21,2 --> 0:5:21,37
each other.


105
0:5:21,37 --> 0:5:23,45
Because everyone has something
to bring to the table, no


106
0:5:23,45 --> 0:5:25,43
matter what.


107
0:5:25,43 --> 0:5:28,26
He's a little quieter until you
rouse him a little, he's


108
0:5:28,26 --> 0:5:30,466
like right with all the boys.


109
0:5:30,466 --> 0:5:31,36
GRIME: What happened?


110
0:5:31,36 --> 0:5:33,78
What happened to the girl that
you were thinking was probably


111
0:5:33,78 --> 0:5:37,667
really good marrying material
because she doesn't do coke?


112
0:5:37,667 --> 0:5:40,649



113
0:5:40,649 --> 0:5:43,631
Remember her?


114
0:5:43,631 --> 0:5:44,625
That was amazing.


115
0:5:44,625 --> 0:5:48,23
CIV: I think when Grime and I
first met we connected on a


116
0:5:48,23 --> 0:5:51,94
wise ass level, because we
didn't know each other at all.


117
0:5:51,94 --> 0:5:56,14
I had these sunglasses on that
I thought were super cool and


118
0:5:56,14 --> 0:5:57,65
I thought, break the ice.


119
0:5:57,65 --> 0:6:0,665
And I just like, dude, stop
sweating my sunglasses.


120
0:6:0,665 --> 0:6:2,98
I was like, do you want
to try them on?


121
0:6:2,98 --> 0:6:6,66
And without missing a beat he
goes no, thanks, I don't have


122
0:6:6,66 --> 0:6:8,936
any fucking ears, so how
would I try them on?


123
0:6:8,936 --> 0:6:12,3
So I was like aw, man.


124
0:6:12,3 --> 0:6:14,6
And he just started cracking
up and the other


125
0:6:14,6 --> 0:6:14,79
dudes started laughing.


126
0:6:14,79 --> 0:6:15,555
He's like you see his face?


127
0:6:15,555 --> 0:6:16,17
See his face?


128
0:6:16,17 --> 0:6:17,96
I fucking got him.


129
0:6:17,96 --> 0:6:19,8
And I was like, oh my
God, this guy's a


130
0:6:19,8 --> 0:6:20,97
complete dick, got it.


131
0:6:20,97 --> 0:6:21,98
All right, cool.


132
0:6:21,98 --> 0:6:24,32
So then that was kind of how
it was, which was back and


133
0:6:24,32 --> 0:6:27,69
forth breaking each other's
balls kind of a thing.


134
0:6:27,69 --> 0:6:29,16
You guys have a wide angle lens


135
0:6:29,16 --> 0:6:30,606
enough for Grime's hairdo?


136
0:6:30,606 --> 0:6:33,98



137
0:6:33,98 --> 0:6:36,93
HENRY LEWIS: I think people
are in love with his


138
0:6:36,93 --> 0:6:39,41
personality more than anything
and then the work is like an


139
0:6:39,41 --> 0:6:42,5
extra bonus.


140
0:6:42,5 --> 0:6:45,39
No two pieces are the
exact same, ever--


141
0:6:45,39 --> 0:6:46,81
that's ill.


142
0:6:46,81 --> 0:6:48,54
Like every day is
something new.


143
0:6:48,54 --> 0:6:51,11
YUTARO SAKAI: His technique
is amazing.


144
0:6:51,11 --> 0:6:54,8
And also, after he's been
tattooing for 17-18 years and


145
0:6:54,8 --> 0:6:58,48
he's still managed to
progress every time.


146
0:6:58,48 --> 0:6:59,83
That's incredible, I think.


147
0:6:59,83 --> 0:7:2,665



148
0:7:2,665 --> 0:7:6,23
CHRIS O'DONNELL: A lot of the
guys that work with him can't


149
0:7:6,23 --> 0:7:9,32
help but be influenced by his
work, working with him on a


150
0:7:9,32 --> 0:7:9,99
daily basis.


151
0:7:9,99 --> 0:7:12,5
He has his own look.


152
0:7:12,5 --> 0:7:17,28
So the shop has got a certain
look that's unique to itself.


153
0:7:17,28 --> 0:7:20,58
I think a big part of what makes
up their look is detail


154
0:7:20,58 --> 0:7:23,9
and effects and then
drawing skill.


155
0:7:23,9 --> 0:7:26,9
And the ability to do
something unique.


156
0:7:26,9 --> 0:7:31,52
And the desire to create
something unique and not just


157
0:7:31,52 --> 0:7:34,16
adapt to what's come
before them.


158
0:7:34,16 --> 0:7:36,0
LANGO OLIVEIRA: There's a lot
of good tattooers out there.


159
0:7:36,0 --> 0:7:41,61
But not a lot of people push
stuff to the limit and he's


160
0:7:41,61 --> 0:7:43,5
been doing that for
a long time.


161
0:7:43,5 --> 0:7:46,39
GRIME: I definitely could
express myself in certain ways


162
0:7:46,39 --> 0:7:48,8
because I have a lot of freedom
with my clients.


163
0:7:48,8 --> 0:7:51,31



164
0:7:51,31 --> 0:7:54,56
And I'm really fortunate
they let me just


165
0:7:54,56 --> 0:7:55,88
push some of the stuff.


166
0:7:55,88 --> 0:8:0,62
Like, they say I want
a skull on my back.


167
0:8:0,62 --> 0:8:2,96
Then I get to go, OK, well,
what do I want that


168
0:8:2,96 --> 0:8:3,7
thing to look like?


169
0:8:3,7 --> 0:8:6,19
Or what are we going
to do with it?


170
0:8:6,19 --> 0:8:8,3
You can try to create expression
or something,


171
0:8:8,3 --> 0:8:9,3
whatever it is--


172
0:8:9,3 --> 0:8:11,95
an idea or a look.


173
0:8:11,95 --> 0:8:15,46
And to me that's very satisfying
to be able to do


174
0:8:15,46 --> 0:8:17,62
that and to see it.


175
0:8:17,62 --> 0:8:19,98
Even though most of the time I
don't really like looking at


176
0:8:19,98 --> 0:8:22,78
my tattoos afterwards.


177
0:8:22,78 --> 0:8:26,91
It's like a hypercritical
eye or something.


178
0:8:26,91 --> 0:8:31,16
Sometimes it's just having
expectation of seeing


179
0:8:31,16 --> 0:8:33,679
something that's not fully
finished yet, and wanting it


180
0:8:33,679 --> 0:8:34,669
to look better.


181
0:8:34,669 --> 0:8:38,299
CIV: When Grime's tattooing you,
if he starts with single


182
0:8:38,299 --> 0:8:40,89
needle stuff it's the most evil,
brutal shit and he's


183
0:8:40,89 --> 0:8:42,299
kind of like laughing
about it.


184
0:8:42,299 --> 0:8:43,929
So it's like you're
kind of thinking


185
0:8:43,929 --> 0:8:46,37
what's wrong with him?


186
0:8:46,37 --> 0:8:53,32
He works feverishly to a point
where you think there's a gun


187
0:8:53,32 --> 0:8:54,87
to his head for some reason.


188
0:8:54,87 --> 0:8:57,23
You don't know why he's trying
to work so fast and so crazy


189
0:8:57,23 --> 0:8:58,28
and kind of talking
to himself.


190
0:8:58,28 --> 0:9:0,855
Because if you know him, it's
just 10,000 things are going


191
0:9:0,855 --> 0:9:1,65
around in his head.


192
0:9:1,65 --> 0:9:4,106
It's like a hornet's nest in
there, so his hands are just


193
0:9:4,106 --> 0:9:4,87
keeping up.


194
0:9:4,87 --> 0:9:8,28
I was actually talking to my
girlfriend on the way here.


195
0:9:8,28 --> 0:9:11,67
She said something like Grime's
style is really weird.


196
0:9:11,67 --> 0:9:12,92
And I said, it is?


197
0:9:12,92 --> 0:9:16,9
She's like, it's beautiful,
but it's weird.


198
0:9:16,9 --> 0:9:19,4
It's his thing.


199
0:9:19,4 --> 0:9:21,39
I'd say Grime's stuff
is tweaky.


200
0:9:21,39 --> 0:9:26,11
Everything is so tweaked out
and so overdone, but with


201
0:9:26,11 --> 0:9:28,98
enough restraint where it
doesn't fuck it up.


202
0:9:28,98 --> 0:9:33,2
HENRY LEWIS: He had this piece
in the "Iron Will" book, and


203
0:9:33,2 --> 0:9:34,28
it was like a vampire woman.


204
0:9:34,28 --> 0:9:37,2
There was no line work
in her bottom jaw.


205
0:9:37,2 --> 0:9:41,1
And her bottom jaw was like this
big black gaspy mouth.


206
0:9:41,1 --> 0:9:43,785
And for some reason-- like, it's
something new, but you


207
0:9:43,785 --> 0:9:46,21
could tell it was based
off a traditional.


208
0:9:46,21 --> 0:9:49,66
Or he did like a snake and a
bell, and then the snake's


209
0:9:49,66 --> 0:9:51,81
made out of this really
weird smoke and dots--


210
0:9:51,81 --> 0:9:53,78
that type of stuff.


211
0:9:53,78 --> 0:9:57,83
That's coming from his head,
that's his style.


212
0:9:57,83 --> 0:10:2,716
And that's the type of stuff
I like that pushes me.


213
0:10:2,716 --> 0:10:6,52
CHRIS O'DONNELL: To me he seemed
very almost angry at


214
0:10:6,52 --> 0:10:7,97
the idea of the status quo.


215
0:10:7,97 --> 0:10:14,9
Like conforming to a style
or not putting


216
0:10:14,9 --> 0:10:16,6
your mark on something.


217
0:10:16,6 --> 0:10:21,0
Like it had to be unique or it
wasn't worth doing at all.


218
0:10:21,0 --> 0:10:24,73
He's very almost obsessive about
getting away from any


219
0:10:24,73 --> 0:10:26,515
kind of mediocre quality.


220
0:10:26,515 --> 0:10:27,65
GRIME: I think about
art a lot.


221
0:10:27,65 --> 0:10:30,29
I think about what I want
tattoos to look like.


222
0:10:30,29 --> 0:10:32,98
I think about the things I like
and don't in tattooing,


223
0:10:32,98 --> 0:10:34,22
in my own work or
other people's


224
0:10:34,22 --> 0:10:35,97
work, and I apply those.


225
0:10:35,97 --> 0:10:38,772
I think about that
stuff a lot.


226
0:10:38,772 --> 0:10:41,85
I try to execute in a way so
that I can get the most amount


227
0:10:41,85 --> 0:10:49,91
of visual pleasure from my work,
both in impact and the


228
0:10:49,91 --> 0:10:52,835
dynamic aspect--


229
0:10:52,835 --> 0:10:54,27
those are really important
to me.


230
0:10:54,27 --> 0:10:59,8



231
0:10:59,8 --> 0:11:2,36
I have pieces that
I actually like.


232
0:11:2,36 --> 0:11:5,7
Tomorrow, the guy I'm tattooing,
he's got a sleeve I


233
0:11:5,7 --> 0:11:5,87
really like.


234
0:11:5,87 --> 0:11:8,51
It's kind of older now, but
I still really like it.


235
0:11:8,51 --> 0:11:11,46
I wouldn't do the same one
again, but overall I really


236
0:11:11,46 --> 0:11:12,76
like the tattoo.


237
0:11:12,76 --> 0:11:14,3
It moves really well
on his arm.


238
0:11:14,3 --> 0:11:15,25
I like the way it looks.


239
0:11:15,25 --> 0:11:17,4
I like the colors.


240
0:11:17,4 --> 0:11:21,22
I mean, not to sound too full
of myself, I don't think it


241
0:11:21,22 --> 0:11:24,17
looks like anyone else's work.


242
0:11:24,17 --> 0:11:24,995
To me that's very important--


243
0:11:24,995 --> 0:11:27,67
I don't want my work to look
like other people's work.


244
0:11:27,67 --> 0:11:28,97
I want it to look
like what I did.


245
0:11:28,97 --> 0:11:34,21
If I can't distinguish my work
from two other guys, well


246
0:11:34,21 --> 0:11:35,86
maybe they should just
do the tattoos.


247
0:11:35,86 --> 0:11:37,41
What am I here for?


248
0:11:37,41 --> 0:11:39,795
To me there's some of that
involved in tattooing.


249
0:11:39,795 --> 0:11:44,3



250
0:11:44,3 --> 0:11:47,48
I want to look at work that
I've done and go oh, wow,


251
0:11:47,48 --> 0:11:47,94
that's cool.


252
0:11:47,94 --> 0:11:48,52
I created that.


253
0:11:48,52 --> 0:11:49,98
I put a lot of energy
into that.


254
0:11:49,98 --> 0:11:52,71
I put a lot of conception
into that.


255
0:11:52,71 --> 0:11:55,2
And wow, look, it kind
of came together.


256
0:11:55,2 --> 0:11:56,6
It kind of gelled together after
all that work and all


257
0:11:56,6 --> 0:12:0,78
that thought and everything
else.


258
0:12:0,78 --> 0:12:2,91
Because we don't have a lot.


259
0:12:2,91 --> 0:12:5,17
The tattoos go away.


260
0:12:5,17 --> 0:12:7,1
It's nice to see them sometimes
and then to have a


261
0:12:7,1 --> 0:12:9,42
good photo is sometimes nice.


262
0:12:9,42 --> 0:12:12,39
We'll have tracings that you
think I should throw way.


263
0:12:12,39 --> 0:12:14,6
Besides that, I don't have
much of tattooing.


264
0:12:14,6 --> 0:14:14,6
