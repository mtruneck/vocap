0:0:28,967 --> 0:0:31,7
(Fran) "Dear Bernard, dear Manny.


3
0:0:31,7 --> 0:0:32,687
I told you I'd write.


4
0:0:32,687 --> 0:0:35,807
Cornwall is...
Well, you've seen the pictures.


5
0:0:35,807 --> 0:0:39,687
It's like the pictures.
Except a lot more boring.


6
0:0:39,687 --> 0:0:44,567
Everybody is at least 300 and they all
speak some kind of medieval English,


7
0:0:44,567 --> 0:0:49,127
the most important word
being 'urrrrrr'.


8
0:0:49,127 --> 0:0:51,687
Can't wait to see you.
Get a bottle open.


9
0:0:51,687 --> 0:0:53,727
Love, Fran.


10
0:0:53,727 --> 0:1:2,167
Urrrrrr."


11
0:1:2,167 --> 0:1:5,767
Bernard? Manny?


12
0:1:5,767 --> 0:1:9,87
- Hello?
- (Bernard) Oh, it's you.


13
0:1:9,87 --> 0:1:16,927
Go round the green bin bags.


14
0:1:16,927 --> 0:1:21,567
Then right till you get
to the mouldy George Eliot.


15
0:1:21,567 --> 0:1:23,447
Then right.


16
0:1:23,447 --> 0:1:26,87
Forward, go on, forward.


17
0:1:26,87 --> 0:1:28,367
And then it's left...


18
0:1:28,367 --> 0:1:40,847
at the dead badger.


19
0:1:40,847 --> 0:1:43,527
Lovely to see you.


20
0:1:43,527 --> 0:1:46,727
Mwah. Mwah.


21
0:1:46,727 --> 0:1:49,327
Bernard, are you OK?


22
0:1:49,327 --> 0:1:57,567
Never better.
I've discovered television.


23
0:1:57,567 --> 0:2:2,447
You don't look right. What's going on
with the shop? Where's Manny?


24
0:2:2,447 --> 0:2:5,927
Erm, he left. He left like
I always knew he would.


25
0:2:5,927 --> 0:2:9,367
That's what people do when you
love, nurture and take care of them.


26
0:2:9,367 --> 0:2:11,367
You mean you sacked him.


27
0:2:11,367 --> 0:2:14,527
There may have been an incident.


28
0:2:14,527 --> 0:2:18,647
Possibly involving a kitchen item
and a hand.


29
0:2:18,647 --> 0:2:22,767
Maybe the hand was Manny's and maybe
the item was a sandwich toaster


30
0:2:22,767 --> 0:2:25,607
and maybe I introduced them
to each other.


31
0:2:25,607 --> 0:2:28,887
- So he's gone.
- Oh, no, he still sleeps here.


32
0:2:28,887 --> 0:2:31,127
Burrowed in like the little tick he is.


33
0:2:31,127 --> 0:2:34,967
But he leaves every day.
Every day is another betrayal.


34
0:2:34,967 --> 0:2:39,207
W-W-What do you mean?


35
0:2:39,207 --> 0:2:54,807
Come on.


36
0:2:54,807 --> 0:2:59,367
There.


37
0:2:59,367 --> 0:3:3,167
There he is, half lago,


38
0:3:3,167 --> 0:3:6,87
half Fu Manchu,


39
0:3:6,87 --> 0:3:10,327
all bastard.


40
0:3:10,327 --> 0:3:13,87
(Mumbling) Hello, how are you today.
(Deeply) Hello.


41
0:3:13,87 --> 0:3:15,287
(Poshly) Hello. How are you?


42
0:3:15,287 --> 0:3:17,327
(Lightly) Oh, hello, how are you?


43
0:3:17,327 --> 0:3:20,87
- (Clears throat)
- Are you today hello how?


44
0:3:20,87 --> 0:3:22,367
How are you today? Hello.


45
0:3:22,367 --> 0:3:25,647
- I'm fine. Do you have...?
- Welcome to Goliath Books.


46
0:3:25,647 --> 0:3:28,727
- I'm looking for...
- I'll help you. Aah!


47
0:3:28,727 --> 0:3:30,487
How may I help you?


48
0:3:30,487 --> 0:3:33,447
- I want...
- My name is Manny.


49
0:3:33,447 --> 0:3:39,767
- Never mind.
- Hello.


50
0:3:39,767 --> 0:3:43,607
(Sighs) I need a drink.


51
0:3:43,607 --> 0:3:46,407
Manny, could you...? Oh.


52
0:3:46,407 --> 0:3:48,447
Bernard, could you get me one?


53
0:3:48,447 --> 0:4:12,647
Get it yourself.
I'm missing my programme.


54
0:4:12,647 --> 0:4:14,127
Manny!


55
0:4:14,127 --> 0:4:16,687
There's no need to flinch.
You're safe now.


56
0:4:16,687 --> 0:4:19,207
With us, you're
a team member. What are you?


57
0:4:19,207 --> 0:4:22,47
- A team member.
- We're glad to have you.


58
0:4:22,47 --> 0:4:24,447
Muffins are for customers.


59
0:4:24,447 --> 0:4:27,7
Now, this is your doo-ti-to-doo card.


60
0:4:27,7 --> 0:4:30,967
Doo-ti-to-doo?


61
0:4:30,967 --> 0:4:34,327
This is the most advanced
retail software in the world.


62
0:4:34,327 --> 0:4:36,367
You're gonna need a password.


63
0:4:36,367 --> 0:4:38,447
Oh, what about surfking?


64
0:4:38,447 --> 0:4:43,527
Hey! Or... teammember8.


65
0:4:43,527 --> 0:4:50,167
From this console, you control the
shopping environment. The shutters...


66
0:4:50,167 --> 0:4:54,87
There's the lights...


67
0:4:54,87 --> 0:4:56,487
There's the revolving displays...


68
0:4:56,487 --> 0:4:59,767
- The cameras...
- (Whirring)


69
0:4:59,767 --> 0:5:4,247
You can order the muffins.


70
0:5:4,247 --> 0:5:7,7
- It does the lot.
- It's fantastic.


71
0:5:7,7 --> 0:5:12,807
Mm. It also monitors toilet visits and
scans your retinas every 80 seconds.


72
0:5:12,807 --> 0:5:17,327
- Why's that?
- Just making sure you're still you.


73
0:5:17,327 --> 0:5:20,647
Some might call it invasive,
but we think it shows we care.


74
0:5:20,647 --> 0:5:27,127
See you later.


75
0:5:27,127 --> 0:5:30,687
- Oh, Fran. How was your trip?
- Manny, come back to the shop.


76
0:5:30,687 --> 0:5:32,927
I'm not going back. I like it here.


77
0:5:32,927 --> 0:5:35,847
I've got respect and responsibility.


78
0:5:35,847 --> 0:5:40,847
I've got a doo-ti-to-doo.


79
0:5:40,847 --> 0:5:42,887
I'm a team member.


80
0:5:42,887 --> 0:5:45,847
Bernard was mean and
wouldn't say sorry. I won't go back.


81
0:5:45,847 --> 0:5:57,47
You have to come back, Manny.
Bernard and I need you.


82
0:5:57,47 --> 0:5:59,87
I'm staying here until you do.


83
0:5:59,87 --> 0:6:4,7
Fran, Fran, somebody will be here
very soon.


84
0:6:4,7 --> 0:6:6,167
- How may I help you?
- She's a friend.


85
0:6:6,167 --> 0:6:9,767
Hey, terrific!
(Flatly) A friend of Manny's.


86
0:6:9,767 --> 0:6:13,327
- How may I help you?
- I'm just browsing.


87
0:6:13,327 --> 0:6:18,727
Well, we have a really comfortable area
over there specially for that.


88
0:6:18,727 --> 0:6:28,367
I wanna browse here.


89
0:6:28,367 --> 0:6:36,447
(Whispers) Sorry.


90
0:6:36,447 --> 0:6:56,367
Right, well, I'll just go home and unpack
and not talk to anyone today, shall I?


91
0:6:56,367 --> 0:6:58,927
So...


92
0:6:58,927 --> 0:7:1,407
A... friend. (Laughs)


93
0:7:1,407 --> 0:7:4,767
Yes. She used to come into the shop
to see me and Bernard.


94
0:7:4,767 --> 0:7:7,7
- It was great, we'd...
- I see.


95
0:7:7,7 --> 0:7:13,367
I took a risk with you, Manny. Don't eat
muffins when I'm developing you.


96
0:7:13,367 --> 0:7:15,487
I took a risk when I gave you a job.


97
0:7:15,487 --> 0:7:19,407
Some would say, "Who is this rudderless
hippy? How do I get away from him?


98
0:7:19,407 --> 0:7:23,207
"Has he got a hunting knife
strapped to his shin?"


99
0:7:23,207 --> 0:7:24,807
But I saw through that.


100
0:7:24,807 --> 0:7:27,967
- But you have to work for me, OK?
- OK.


101
0:7:27,967 --> 0:7:30,207
- We're your friends now.
- Yes, I know.


102
0:7:30,207 --> 0:7:32,247
- Thank you, Evan.
- OK.


103
0:7:32,247 --> 0:7:34,327
One of our valued younger customers


104
0:7:34,327 --> 0:7:36,727
has blocked the toilet
with Monster Munch.


105
0:7:36,727 --> 0:7:40,287
Now, I need that toilet back in play.
Let's approach that as a team.


106
0:7:40,287 --> 0:7:48,847
- How can we make that happen?
- OK, we could phone for a plumb...


107
0:7:48,847 --> 0:8:10,727
Go, team!


108
0:8:10,727 --> 0:8:14,727
Oh, no, no, no!
I'm gonna be late!


109
0:8:14,727 --> 0:8:31,207
I'm gonna lose team champion points.


110
0:8:31,207 --> 0:8:35,7
Bernard, I've washed your sheets
but haven't dried them. Can you do it?


111
0:8:35,7 --> 0:8:47,47
Breakfast! Breakfast!


112
0:8:47,47 --> 0:8:49,887
The beans are under the milk.


113
0:8:49,887 --> 0:8:52,167
- That's it. You're evicted.
- What?


114
0:8:52,167 --> 0:8:55,887
Up with this I will not put.


115
0:8:55,887 --> 0:8:58,527
- Pack and be gone.
- Bernard, no.


116
0:8:58,527 --> 0:9:0,767
Look at you. Who will look after you?


117
0:9:0,767 --> 0:9:3,527
You can't live off
the mushrooms in your hair.


118
0:9:3,527 --> 0:9:12,247
I'm fine.


119
0:9:12,247 --> 0:9:15,167
Go on. Get out. Go to him.


120
0:9:15,167 --> 0:9:18,527
Go to your fancy man.
I don't need you any more.


121
0:9:18,527 --> 0:9:25,207
Bernard, it doesn't have to be like this.
If you would just apologise...


122
0:9:25,207 --> 0:9:27,687
You'd come back and work in the shop?


123
0:9:27,687 --> 0:9:32,87
- Everything would be normal?
- Yes.


124
0:9:32,87 --> 0:9:33,887
You'd cook and clean


125
0:9:33,887 --> 0:9:38,767
and surprise me with profiteroles if
I took you to the pictures at Christmas?


126
0:9:38,767 --> 0:9:42,167
- Yes.
- And all I have to do is say sorry?


127
0:9:42,167 --> 0:9:44,927
That's exactly what I'm saying.


128
0:9:44,927 --> 0:9:57,527
I thought so. Get out!


129
0:9:57,527 --> 0:10:1,207
Morning.


130
0:10:1,207 --> 0:10:5,327
Hah! He's bending down now.


131
0:10:5,327 --> 0:10:8,847
(Bernard) He's getting up again.
I knew he'd do that.


132
0:10:8,847 --> 0:10:12,927
- Is this really helping?
- Now he's going up that little ladder.


133
0:10:12,927 --> 0:10:16,47
Up he goes, with that little wiggle of his.


134
0:10:16,47 --> 0:10:18,847
The wiggle of Judas.


135
0:10:18,847 --> 0:10:22,727
The Judas boogie.


136
0:10:22,727 --> 0:10:27,167
Well, I think
you're both being really selfish.


137
0:10:27,167 --> 0:10:29,447
What about me?
What am I supposed to do?


138
0:10:29,447 --> 0:10:37,287
I'm a girl and it's horrible in here.


139
0:10:37,287 --> 0:10:42,967
Look at yourself.
How can you live like this?


140
0:10:42,967 --> 0:10:45,7
- Don't move.
- What?


141
0:10:45,7 --> 0:11:3,807
- Don't... move.
- What?


142
0:11:3,807 --> 0:11:7,447
Oh, hello, I'm looking for
somewhere in the Bloomsbury area


143
0:11:7,447 --> 0:11:13,127
overlooking Hyde Park with a good view
of the river and a spiral staircase.


144
0:11:13,127 --> 0:11:15,167
My budget? L-Is 100 a week.


145
0:11:15,167 --> 0:11:17,767
Manny!


146
0:11:17,767 --> 0:11:22,807
- Do you have a mo for a small chatette?
- Fine-a-mundo.


147
0:11:22,807 --> 0:11:27,167
Now, I've been thinking about clothes
and what they say about us.


148
0:11:27,167 --> 0:11:30,727
The good thing about here
is that we get to wear our own clothes.


149
0:11:30,727 --> 0:11:32,767
- We're not robots.
- No.


150
0:11:32,767 --> 0:11:36,807
(Monotonous) Hello, can I help you?
Hello, can I help you?


151
0:11:36,807 --> 0:11:40,607
Hello, can I... help you...?


152
0:11:40,607 --> 0:11:43,647
- Hello, can I help...?
- Manny!


153
0:11:43,647 --> 0:11:50,207
We love your style. OK? The shirts,
the sandals... Heh-heh! It's funky.


154
0:11:50,207 --> 0:11:52,847
But imagine we're all on a football team.


155
0:11:52,847 --> 0:11:55,647
The guy on the wing,
he's wearing a crazy shirt.


156
0:11:55,647 --> 0:11:58,887
Nobody knows what team he's on.
Can I pass to him? Don't know.


157
0:11:58,887 --> 0:12:1,687
And look, his sandal has come off
on the muddy ground.


158
0:12:1,687 --> 0:12:5,847
- Damn it! We've lost five-nil.
- (Groans)


159
0:12:5,847 --> 0:12:8,87
So tomorrow, plain pastels, please.


160
0:12:8,87 --> 0:12:11,87
And if you'd be so good, a pair of shoes.


161
0:12:11,87 --> 0:12:13,727
- But we're not playing football.
- Great.


162
0:12:13,727 --> 0:12:18,207
- It's a floor, it's...
- Good. So long as we're happy.


163
0:12:18,207 --> 0:12:27,407
- We don't have oranges at half-time.
- Great!


164
0:12:27,407 --> 0:12:30,847
(Irish voice) Mmm. Cheers!
(Gruff voice) Cheers.


165
0:12:30,847 --> 0:12:33,487
(Fran) Cheers. (Giggles)


166
0:12:33,487 --> 0:12:36,367
(Fran with Irish accent)
Manny, hurry up with the wine!


167
0:12:36,367 --> 0:12:38,727
Yes, Manny, come on.


168
0:12:38,727 --> 0:12:41,407
(As Manny) Sorry, Bernard, Bernard.


169
0:12:41,407 --> 0:12:44,967
Shall we go to the pub or just stay in?


170
0:12:44,967 --> 0:12:53,47
Fran?


171
0:12:53,47 --> 0:12:55,127
I have to have somewhere to go.


172
0:12:55,127 --> 0:12:57,567
Bernard really wants to talk to you.


173
0:12:57,567 --> 0:13:0,287
(As Bernard) Yes, I do.


174
0:13:0,287 --> 0:13:14,807
And if you won't go,
I'm gonna have to live here.


175
0:13:14,807 --> 0:13:17,727
Now, we are going to sort this out, OK?


176
0:13:17,727 --> 0:13:27,967
Bernard, I think you have
something to say to Manny.


177
0:13:27,967 --> 0:13:31,247
Manny, I'm sorry.


178
0:13:31,247 --> 0:13:35,7
I'm sorry I ever let you in here


179
0:13:35,7 --> 0:13:37,47
to rob me of my best years


180
0:13:37,47 --> 0:13:41,247
before leaving me a burnt-out husk.


181
0:13:41,247 --> 0:13:46,647
Well, that gives us somewhere
to work from, don't you think?


182
0:13:46,647 --> 0:13:51,7
Manny, you would like to tell Bernard
how much you'd like to come back


183
0:13:51,7 --> 0:13:54,7
and... make it all nice again.


184
0:13:54,7 --> 0:13:57,407
No, wait a minute.
This is all about you, isn't it, Fran?


185
0:13:57,407 --> 0:13:59,447
You're being totally selfish.


186
0:13:59,447 --> 0:14:3,527
Why can't you let us have our vicious
soul-destroying break-up in peace?


187
0:14:3,527 --> 0:14:8,967
Right. We are in pieces and you only care
about having a place to hang around.


188
0:14:8,967 --> 0:14:11,367
- Yeah, thanks.
- (Bernard) Not at all.


189
0:14:11,367 --> 0:14:14,967
- It's never going to be like it was, Fran.
- Never. I agree.


190
0:14:14,967 --> 0:14:18,847
We agree. Manny and I
are opposed on every point.


191
0:14:18,847 --> 0:14:23,127
- Well put.
- Thank you.


192
0:14:23,127 --> 0:14:25,927
Haven't you got other friends to annoy?
Persecute them.


193
0:14:25,927 --> 0:14:29,647
Yeah, yeah. Society lady.


194
0:14:29,647 --> 0:14:31,927
How come you went to Cornwall
on your own?


195
0:14:31,927 --> 0:14:36,607
- Yeah, how come?
- I've... got... friends.


196
0:14:36,607 --> 0:14:38,687
Well, go to them.


197
0:14:38,687 --> 0:14:41,247
- I will.
- Don't let us stop you.


198
0:14:41,247 --> 0:14:43,607
- I won't.
- Well, go on then.


199
0:14:43,607 --> 0:14:51,407
Toodle-oo!


200
0:14:51,407 --> 0:14:55,287
- Mya-mya.
- Wurrrrr...


201
0:14:55,287 --> 0:15:1,727
She's...


202
0:15:1,727 --> 0:15:9,7
Oh, er, listen.
Don't forget to dry your sheets.


203
0:15:9,7 --> 0:15:12,527
Well, I'll be off then,
since it's all over between us.


204
0:15:12,527 --> 0:15:16,447
- I'll write.
- I won't read it.


205
0:15:16,447 --> 0:15:19,767
- Well, I'll call.
- I'll hang up.


206
0:15:19,767 --> 0:15:24,687
- I'll come and see you.
- I'll be dead by then.


207
0:15:24,687 --> 0:15:27,127
Listen, it doesn't have to be like this.


208
0:15:27,127 --> 0:15:45,607
If you would just say those two words.


209
0:15:45,607 --> 0:15:56,527
Get out!


210
0:15:56,527 --> 0:16:1,687
OK, huddle time, huddle time.
Gather round, guys. (Clears throat)


211
0:16:1,687 --> 0:16:4,487
- Great day today, team!
- (AIl) Yes!


212
0:16:4,487 --> 0:16:8,847
- Whoo!
- OK, OK. That was a silver star day.


213
0:16:8,847 --> 0:16:11,167
Tomorrow, I want gold.


214
0:16:11,167 --> 0:16:14,207
OK? Selling books is a game.
It has rules.


215
0:16:14,207 --> 0:16:17,647
You need to learn those rules
and get serious about them


216
0:16:17,647 --> 0:16:21,887
because it's not a game.


217
0:16:21,887 --> 0:16:25,87
OK, home time. Off you go.


218
0:16:25,87 --> 0:16:28,847
- You coming, Manny?
- No, I thought I'd put in an extra hour.


219
0:16:28,847 --> 0:16:35,247
Really get to grips with the doo-ti-to-doo.


220
0:16:35,247 --> 0:16:39,487
Above the call of duty. One team
champion point for you right there, sir.


221
0:16:39,487 --> 0:16:45,447
Yes!


222
0:16:45,447 --> 0:16:47,607
Manny, your hair.


223
0:16:47,607 --> 0:16:52,527
Does it ever get in the way at all?


224
0:16:52,527 --> 0:17:58,887
- Not... really.
- Oh.


225
0:17:58,887 --> 0:18:1,567
- Good morning, Manny.
- Morning, Evan.


226
0:18:1,567 --> 0:18:4,807
Er, just popped in to do my yoga.


227
0:18:4,807 --> 0:18:9,687
I do it every morning, in my yoga bag.


228
0:18:9,687 --> 0:18:15,47
Just running through a few positions.
This is the Worm.


229
0:18:15,47 --> 0:18:21,487
Worm Saluting The Sun.


230
0:18:21,487 --> 0:18:29,527
Er, Anaconda.


231
0:18:29,527 --> 0:18:31,567
Manny...


232
0:18:31,567 --> 0:18:34,607
I'm a reasonable guy,
I'm straight with people.


233
0:18:34,607 --> 0:18:38,567
I expect them to be the same.
If you tell me the truth, I won't get mad.


234
0:18:38,567 --> 0:18:43,7
So tell me, did you sleep here last night?


235
0:18:43,7 --> 0:18:48,927
Yes, I did.


236
0:18:48,927 --> 0:18:56,7
I'm really angry now!


237
0:18:56,7 --> 0:19:0,527
(Hacking cough)
Not so good. Not feeling so good.


238
0:19:0,527 --> 0:19:4,972
Coffee... and something... medicine.


239
0:19:4,972 --> 0:19:7,47
"PØÍPRAVEK NA HUBENÍ SLIMÁKÙ"


240
0:19:7,47 --> 0:19:13,247
Kill some slugs.


241
0:19:13,247 --> 0:19:17,7
Kapow oven cleaner. If you can clean
an oven, you can clean me.


242
0:19:17,7 --> 0:19:22,647
Aagh!


243
0:19:22,647 --> 0:19:24,687
Coffee. Coffee.


244
0:19:24,687 --> 0:19:54,127
Aha. That's it.


245
0:19:54,127 --> 0:19:49,834
When you look at me, Manny,
what do you see?


246
0:19:49,834 --> 0:19:56,847
"ZAVØENO - ŠKOLENÍ PERSONÁLU"


247
0:19:56,847 --> 0:19:59,47
- Well...
- I'll tell you.


248
0:19:59,47 --> 0:20:2,887
You see me and you say,
"Hey, there's Evan. He's a young guy.


249
0:20:2,887 --> 0:20:7,727
"He likes the Stereophonics,
he rides a scooter.


250
0:20:7,727 --> 0:20:10,127
"Let's see how far I can push him."


251
0:20:10,127 --> 0:20:12,647
Well, you've let me down, Manny.


252
0:20:12,647 --> 0:20:15,487
- Please give me one more chance.
- I need a sign.


253
0:20:15,487 --> 0:20:20,447
A sign that you can change.
I need you to do something for me.


254
0:20:20,447 --> 0:20:29,207
- What?
- (Hoarsely) I think you know.


255
0:20:29,207 --> 0:20:34,447
Oh...


256
0:20:34,447 --> 0:20:36,727
The hair, Manny!


257
0:20:36,727 --> 0:20:39,87
It's a wall between
you and the customers,


258
0:20:39,87 --> 0:20:43,607
between you and me, you and the future!


259
0:20:43,607 --> 0:20:50,127
We need you to look like this.


260
0:20:50,127 --> 0:20:53,407
Not the hair. Please, not the hair!


261
0:20:53,407 --> 0:20:56,167
I've had it since I was nine.


262
0:20:56,167 --> 0:21:33,167
It's time.


263
0:21:33,167 --> 0:21:36,327
No, no, no...


264
0:21:36,327 --> 0:21:39,927
- How are you doing in there, Manny?
- (Clippers whirring)


265
0:21:39,927 --> 0:21:43,607
We're all rooting for you out here.


266
0:21:43,607 --> 0:21:45,927
Manny. (Knocks)


267
0:21:45,927 --> 0:21:54,407
Manny! Manny!


268
0:21:54,407 --> 0:22:1,87
Manny!


269
0:22:1,87 --> 0:22:3,887
Bernard, I'm sorry.


270
0:22:3,887 --> 0:22:9,847
It was my fault you toasted my hand.
Will you take me back? Please?


271
0:22:9,847 --> 0:22:12,847
Bernard, where are you?


272
0:22:12,847 --> 0:22:22,207
- Bernard.
- (Bernard) Manny.


273
0:22:22,207 --> 0:22:24,567
Manny, I don't feel that well.


274
0:22:24,567 --> 0:22:29,327
I... Like I've been beaten up underwater.


275
0:22:29,327 --> 0:22:35,847
I can feel bits of my brain falling away
like a wet cake.


276
0:22:35,847 --> 0:22:42,167
- Could you help me?
- I will, Bernard. I will.


277
0:22:42,167 --> 0:22:44,447
Bernard, Manny.


278
0:22:44,447 --> 0:22:47,967
I've come to tell you I'm moving
to Cornwall to start a new life.


279
0:22:47,967 --> 0:22:51,207
- Yeah, just give us a hand, will you?
- OK.


280
0:22:51,207 --> 0:22:55,487
- I was gonna go, you know.
- Yeah, yeah.


281
0:22:55,487 --> 0:23:1,767
Hang in there, Bernard. Fran,
get some hot towels and fluffy water.


282
0:23:1,767 --> 0:23:3,407
Manny!


283
0:23:3,407 --> 0:23:5,527
(Menacingly) Come here.


284
0:23:5,527 --> 0:23:10,887
Bernard, he wants my hair.


285
0:23:10,887 --> 0:23:13,967
How dare you?


286
0:23:13,967 --> 0:23:17,847
Don't you touch a hair
on that boy's head.


287
0:23:17,847 --> 0:23:20,687
Have you no respect?


288
0:23:20,687 --> 0:23:22,727
He's mine.


289
0:23:22,727 --> 0:23:26,47
Get your own human plaything.


290
0:23:26,47 --> 0:23:33,647
You quartz-brained little cream puff!


291
0:23:33,647 --> 0:23:38,47
OK! Well, I tried. There's no point
outreaching to people like you.


292
0:23:38,47 --> 0:23:43,127
In two years you could have been vice
deputy sub assistant, but you're not.


293
0:23:43,127 --> 0:24:9,527
You're here, shuffling around
on the floor like the worm you are.


294
0:24:9,527 --> 0:24:12,207
Manny, I'm so sorry


295
0:24:12,207 --> 0:24:16,727
that you had to go through that abuse.


296
0:24:16,727 --> 0:24:20,567
We're a little hungry now,
so fetch up some wine, would you?


297
0:24:20,567 --> 0:24:24,287
Oh, yes, Manny, get something nice.
We're famished.


298
0:24:24,287 --> 0:24:30,367
- OK, what sort of thing would you like?
- Don't ask questions, just do it!


299
0:24:30,367 --> 0:24:33,807
And clean this place up, it's a disgrace.


300
0:24:33,807 --> 0:24:37,287
Boil my eyebath
and polish the stair rods.


301
0:24:37,287 --> 0:24:41,327
Delouse the duvet
and tumble-dry our doilies.


302
0:24:41,327 --> 0:24:43,407
And hoover the roof


303
0:24:43,407 --> 0:24:49,0
and whistle down the chimneys.


304
