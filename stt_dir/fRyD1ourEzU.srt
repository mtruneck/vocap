The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope – with
a little help from an amateur astronomer – has


2
0:0:8,129 --> 0:0:15,559
produced one of the best views yet of nearby
galaxy Messier 106, a striking spiral galaxy


3
0:0:15,559 --> 0:0:19,359
with a number of secrets.


4
0:0:19,359 --> 0:0:25,98
Located a little over 20 million light-years
away, practically a neighbor by galactic standards,


5
0:0:25,98 --> 0:0:32,5
Messier 106 is one of the brightest and nearest
spiral galaxies to our Milky Way. Although


6
0:0:32,5 --> 0:0:38,269
it may not look particularly unique, some
of its features have baffled astronomers for


7
0:0:38,269 --> 0:0:39,65
years.


8
0:0:39,65 --> 0:0:46,0
Messier 106 has a supermassive black hole
at its centre. Although this is true for most


9
0:0:46,0 --> 0:0:51,53
galaxies, this black hole is particularly
active and hungry, gobbling up nearby material


10
0:0:51,53 --> 0:0:59,6
at a startling rate.


11
0:0:59,6 --> 0:1:6,32
This huge black hole’s bottomless appetite
is behind much of the galaxy’s unusual behavior.


12
0:1:6,32 --> 0:1:11,12
Messier 106 appears to be emitting powerful
radiation from its centre — something we


13
0:1:11,12 --> 0:1:15,41
do not see with our Milky Way or other similar
spirals. This is caused by the very active


14
0:1:15,41 --> 0:1:21,23
black hole at the galaxy’s centre, which
violently drags gas and dust inwards. This


15
0:1:21,23 --> 0:1:29,51
material heats up, emitting bright microwave
and X-ray radiation as it does so.


16
0:1:29,51 --> 0:1:38,46
However, this emission is not the most intriguing
feature of this spiral galaxy. This image


17
0:1:38,46 --> 0:1:44,21
shows the galaxy’s other not-so-hidden secret
— alongside its two regular star-packed


18
0:1:44,21 --> 0:1:56,26
spiral arms, it appears to have two more,
made of hot, glowing gas. While these extra


19
0:1:56,26 --> 0:2:3,659
arms have been known about for decades, astronomers
were unsure of how they formed — until recently.


20
0:2:3,659 --> 0:2:11,72
Yet again, the culprit is Messier 106’s
supermassive black hole. The extra arms are


21
0:2:11,72 --> 0:2:16,67
actually regions of gas that have been heated
up to scorching temperatures of millions of


22
0:2:16,67 --> 0:2:22,72
degrees. As material spins around and heats
up at the galaxy’s centre, the turbulent


23
0:2:22,72 --> 0:2:27,67
motion causes jets of material to shoot outwards.


24
0:2:27,67 --> 0:2:33,8
The jets disrupt and heat up all the gas in
their path, which in turn excites denser gas


25
0:2:33,8 --> 0:2:39,39
towards the centre of the galaxy. This gas
is tightly bound together, so it remains roughly


26
0:2:39,39 --> 0:2:45,6
straight. However, the looser gas further
out is blown away from the jets so that it


27
0:2:45,6 --> 0:2:54,18
curves out of the galactic plane — creating
the arching red arms seen in this image.


28
0:2:54,18 --> 0:2:59,97
These “extra” arms are very unusual, and
this poses a bit of a puzzle, because galactic


29
0:2:59,97 --> 0:3:5,29
jets are actually quite common. It is not
just spirals that show jets — elliptical


30
0:3:5,29 --> 0:3:11,27
galaxies do too, such as the spectacular radio
jets seen around the nearby galaxies Hercules


31
0:3:11,27 --> 0:3:23,29
A and Centaurus A. And yet none of these shows
any of the features seen in Messier 106.


32
0:3:23,29 --> 0:3:28,68
Some of the data for this image of Messier
106 was provided by amateur astronomer Robert


33
0:3:28,68 --> 0:3:34,489
Gendler. Together with Hubble, these data
allow us to visualize the galaxy’s chaotic


34
0:3:34,489 --> 0:5:34,489
center and mysterious structure better than
ever before.
