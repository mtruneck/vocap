0:0:2,197 --> 0:0:3,53
JACOB SOBOROFF: Hey, it's Jacob.


3
0:0:3,53 --> 0:0:6,16
Today we have style guru Amy
Pham right here in the house.


4
0:0:6,16 --> 0:0:7,993
But first, I gotta tell
you about this band.


5
0:0:7,993 --> 0:0:9,695
They have 600
million views and one


6
0:0:9,695 --> 0:0:11,7
of the biggest
videos of the day.


7
0:0:11,7 --> 0:0:13,45
But they're not even a household
name in the United States--


8
0:0:13,45 --> 0:0:14,1
yet.


9
0:0:14,1 --> 0:0:17,15
K-pop sensation 2NE1
just dropped two videos


10
0:0:17,15 --> 0:0:18,739
and practically
broke the internet.

[MUSIC - 2NE1]


12
0:0:22,162 --> 0:0:33,43



13
0:0:33,43 --> 0:0:35,935
Last week, they released their
first album in four years,


14
0:0:35,935 --> 0:0:38,66
and it's about the crack the
top 10 in the iTunes charts.


15
0:0:38,66 --> 0:0:40,44
2NE1 kicked off a huge
tour last weekend,


16
0:0:40,44 --> 0:0:42,17
but if you're not going to have
the chance to see them live,


17
0:0:42,17 --> 0:0:44,19
head over to their
channel for almost 300


18
0:0:44,19 --> 0:0:46,959
more servings of
K-pop awesomessness.


19
0:0:46,959 --> 0:0:47,75
Hey, it's Amy Pham.


20
0:0:47,75 --> 0:0:50,702
Amy, episode two of "Ask
Amy!" is online right now.


21
0:0:50,702 --> 0:0:51,66
AMY PHAM: Indeed it is!


22
0:0:51,66 --> 0:0:52,99
JACOB SOBOROFF: What
is going on with that?


23
0:0:52,99 --> 0:0:54,6
AMY PHAM: People
can ask questions,


24
0:0:54,6 --> 0:0:57,2
whether it's a style
dilemma, fashion problem,


25
0:0:57,2 --> 0:0:58,95
or any other question
they want to ask me.


26
0:0:58,95 --> 0:1:0,68
And we feature their
questions on the show.


27
0:1:0,68 --> 0:1:2,22
AUDIENCE: How can I wear
a full leather jumpsuit


28
0:1:2,22 --> 0:1:3,75
without looking
like a dominatrix?


29
0:1:3,75 --> 0:1:5,876
AMY PHAM: You are
ballsy, and I love it.


30
0:1:5,876 --> 0:1:7,25
The key to this
outfit is to pair


31
0:1:7,25 --> 0:1:9,33
the super tough,
badass leather fabric


32
0:1:9,33 --> 0:1:12,365
with softer, casual
details to keep


33
0:1:12,365 --> 0:1:13,99
it less superhero
and more street wear.


34
0:1:13,99 --> 0:1:16,11
JACOB SOBOROFF: Do people
ask about, like, underpants?


35
0:1:16,11 --> 0:1:16,59
AMY PHAM: No, actually.


36
0:1:16,59 --> 0:1:17,631
I haven't gotten one yet.


37
0:1:17,631 --> 0:1:18,38
I want them to.


38
0:1:18,38 --> 0:1:20,297
I would love to address
underpants situations.


39
0:1:20,297 --> 0:1:22,213
JACOB SOBOROFF: If you
have a fashion dilemma,


40
0:1:22,213 --> 0:1:24,37
or if you think I have a
fashion dilemma that Amy


41
0:1:24,37 --> 0:1:25,12
could help me deal with--


42
0:1:25,12 --> 0:1:26,745
AMY PHAM: You send
them to the platform


43
0:1:26,745 --> 0:1:28,557
using the hashtag #AskAmy.


44
0:1:28,557 --> 0:1:30,89
JACOB SOBOROFF: When you dial
9-11 in this neighborhood,


45
0:1:30,89 --> 0:1:33,3
the fire department may
not be the first to arrive.


46
0:1:33,3 --> 0:1:35,48
Rocky Robinson co-founded
the Bed-Stuy Ambulance Core


47
0:1:35,48 --> 0:1:37,98
when his niece died due to lack
immediate medical attention.


48
0:1:37,98 --> 0:1:39,979
And he realized he needed
do something about it.


49
0:1:39,979 --> 0:1:41,65
ROCKY ROBINSON: I
saw this group called


50
0:1:41,65 --> 0:1:44,37
Hatzola, a Jewish
Ambulance Core.


51
0:1:44,37 --> 0:1:48,225
When I was working with EMS,
and what we got on the scene,


52
0:1:48,225 --> 0:1:51,5
Hatzola already had their
people to the hospital.


53
0:1:51,5 --> 0:1:53,61
But then when we'd
respond to the ghetto,


54
0:1:53,61 --> 0:1:55,78
the person was dead
most of the time


55
0:1:55,78 --> 0:1:57,965
because the ambulance
took too long to come.


56
0:1:57,965 --> 0:2:0,9
JACOB SOBOROFF: The People's
EMS is entirely funded


57
0:2:0,9 --> 0:2:2,487
by donations, and even the
commander's own pension


58
0:2:2,487 --> 0:2:3,57
when the money gets tight.


59
0:2:3,57 --> 0:2:4,64
To learn more about
what is really


60
0:2:4,64 --> 0:2:7,98
just an incredible organization,
head over to their website


61
0:2:7,98 --> 0:2:8,66
and you can get involved.


62
0:2:8,66 --> 0:2:11,83
CARLY: I love books,
like, love, love books.

Like,
 the-floor-of-my-apartment-is-probably-going-to-collapse-due-to-the-weight-of-all-of-my-bookcases


64
0:2:16,47 --> 0:2:17,2
love books.


65
0:2:17,2 --> 0:2:19,54
Which is why this gorgeous
stop-m motion animation


66
0:2:19,54 --> 0:2:22,37
tugs at every single one of
my bookworm heart strings.


67
0:2:22,37 --> 0:2:29,29



68
0:2:29,29 --> 0:2:31,83
I can't believe this is made
by an animation student.


69
0:2:31,83 --> 0:2:34,334
And it only has a few hundred
views, so let's fix that.


70
0:2:34,334 --> 0:2:36,5
If you know a book lover
or two, send this their way


71
0:2:36,5 --> 0:2:37,458
and brighten their day.


72
0:2:37,458 --> 0:2:39,512
Hey, that rhymes!


73
0:2:39,512 --> 0:2:41,72
JACOB SOBOROFF: CT Fletcher
has three drug-free world


74
0:2:41,72 --> 0:2:43,89
titles in bench press,
three curling titles,


75
0:2:43,89 --> 0:2:46,8
and less than a decade ago,
he flat-lined three times


76
0:2:46,8 --> 0:2:47,93
during open heart surgery.


77
0:2:47,93 --> 0:2:49,429
But that didn't
stop the 54-year-old


78
0:2:49,429 --> 0:2:52,3
from coming back and winning
the drug-free world bodybuilding


79
0:2:52,3 --> 0:2:52,8
title.


80
0:2:52,8 --> 0:2:54,591
In this video, with
almost 2 million views,


81
0:2:54,591 --> 0:2:57,18
he introduces us to his friend,
appropriately called Da Hulk.


82
0:2:57,18 --> 0:2:58,679
CT FLETCHER: We
about to break bread


83
0:2:58,679 --> 0:3:0,39
and eat up in this [BLEEP].


84
0:3:0,39 --> 0:3:1,185
Hulk crash!


85
0:3:1,185 --> 0:3:4,27



86
0:3:4,27 --> 0:3:6,22
Hulk crash!


87
0:3:6,22 --> 0:3:9,282
And there's a whole bunch of
[BLEEP] on YouTube going, What?


88
0:3:9,282 --> 0:3:10,99
JACOB SOBOROFF: Fair
warning-- his videos


89
0:3:10,99 --> 0:3:12,4
have no shortage of f-bombs.


90
0:3:12,4 --> 0:3:13,816
But if you're down
with that, they


91
0:3:13,816 --> 0:3:16,24
will get you pumped up for
anything-- Job interviews,


92
0:3:16,24 --> 0:3:20,62
tennis matches, calling your
bank-- whatever your thing is.


93
0:3:20,62 --> 0:3:22,27
Sometimes people here are
so passionate about getting


94
0:3:22,27 --> 0:3:23,99
a video on this show,
they'll submit it


95
0:3:23,99 --> 0:3:25,33
outside of working hours.


96
0:3:25,33 --> 0:3:26,237
You know who you are.


97
0:3:26,237 --> 0:3:27,7
EARNEST: Hey, Jacob.


98
0:3:27,7 --> 0:3:28,69
It's Earnest, of course.


99
0:3:28,69 --> 0:3:30,664
And I want to share with you
this thing called "Big Head,"


100
0:3:30,664 --> 0:3:32,83
and it's the funniest thing
that you will see today.


101
0:3:32,83 --> 0:3:34,33
BIG HEAD: Has anyone
seem my gloves?


102
0:3:34,33 --> 0:3:36,29
Really need to know
where my gloves are.


103
0:3:36,29 --> 0:3:37,57
Of course I looked
in my coat pocket!


104
0:3:37,57 --> 0:3:39,1
That's the first place I looked!


105
0:3:39,1 --> 0:3:41,2
Now I can't go into work
early, use the bathroom


106
0:3:41,2 --> 0:3:42,7
like I normally do.


107
0:3:42,7 --> 0:3:45,15
I know they're not in my car so
I'm not even going to go check.


108
0:3:45,15 --> 0:3:45,75
Yeah, they weren't in my car.


109
0:3:45,75 --> 0:3:46,19
JACOB SOBOROFF: Thanks, Earnest.


110
0:3:46,19 --> 0:3:47,72

you guys are watching.

a video that you love,

hashtag #youtubenation.
