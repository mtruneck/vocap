1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:11,26



2
0:0:11,26 --> 0:0:14,72
-There's nothing more amazing
than having vibrating metal


3
0:0:14,72 --> 0:0:16,5
steel between your legs.


4
0:0:16,5 --> 0:0:18,83
I mean, those fucking
horny ass drivers--


5
0:0:18,83 --> 0:0:20,39
they thought they were going
to have Stephanie's hard


6
0:0:20,39 --> 0:0:21,28
nipples against their backs.


7
0:0:21,28 --> 0:0:23,27
Instead, they had me and Harry's
dick and balls on


8
0:0:23,27 --> 0:0:24,62
their denim material.


9
0:0:24,62 --> 0:0:26,22
And there's nothing better
than having your dick and


10
0:0:26,22 --> 0:0:29,32
balls leave an imprint on denim
material while you're


11
0:0:29,32 --> 0:0:31,77
doing the fucking gay
ass Titanic pose.


12
0:0:31,77 --> 0:0:33,78
It's amazing.


13
0:0:33,78 --> 0:0:37,12
So anyways, we're
in Zhengzhou.


14
0:0:37,12 --> 0:0:39,25
It's a big town for
transportation.


15
0:0:39,25 --> 0:0:40,41
All the trains come
through here.


16
0:0:40,41 --> 0:0:44,441
We're going to go down the
street and get some food.


17
0:0:44,441 --> 0:0:45,691
OK, let's go.


18
0:0:45,691 --> 0:0:52,4



19
0:0:52,4 --> 0:0:54,9
Ask them where the other
people that look


20
0:0:54,9 --> 0:0:55,34
like him hang out.


21
0:0:55,34 --> 0:1:8,364



22
0:1:8,364 --> 0:1:9,614
Damn, fool.


23
0:1:9,614 --> 0:1:12,792



24
0:1:12,792 --> 0:1:14,92
Ancient Chinese style.


25
0:1:14,92 --> 0:1:16,94
I got to make my man look good
for the Chinese girls.


26
0:1:16,94 --> 0:1:18,19
That's a good one.


27
0:1:18,19 --> 0:1:21,6



28
0:1:21,6 --> 0:1:23,19
Yeah, we're not looking
for fine.


29
0:1:23,19 --> 0:1:24,34
We need it to be awesome.


30
0:1:24,34 --> 0:1:26,46
That one looks better.


31
0:1:26,46 --> 0:1:26,97
You like it?


32
0:1:26,97 --> 0:1:27,77
That's good?


33
0:1:27,77 --> 0:1:28,44
Would you fuck him?


34
0:1:28,44 --> 0:1:29,72
-Sexy.


35
0:1:29,72 --> 0:1:30,94
-This one?


36
0:1:30,94 --> 0:1:33,33
You like this haircut?


37
0:1:33,33 --> 0:1:33,66
Let's do it.


38
0:1:33,66 --> 0:1:34,885
This might be the winner.


39
0:1:34,885 --> 0:1:35,81
-Is this it?


40
0:1:35,81 --> 0:1:38,6
-This might be it.


41
0:1:38,6 --> 0:1:40,27
This might be the way
to go, right?


42
0:1:40,27 --> 0:1:43,515
Harry's already cute,
and the dog is cute.


43
0:1:43,515 --> 0:1:44,78
Cute on cute.


44
0:1:44,78 --> 0:1:47,59
-Aw, you are so cute.


45
0:1:47,59 --> 0:1:48,53
-It's getting better.


46
0:1:48,53 --> 0:1:50,24
It's getting better.


47
0:1:50,24 --> 0:1:51,32
Let's try this guy.


48
0:1:51,32 --> 0:1:53,13
Oh, is that [INAUDIBLE].


49
0:1:53,13 --> 0:1:53,86
Yeah, dude--


50
0:1:53,86 --> 0:1:54,82
-Is that my style?


51
0:1:54,82 --> 0:1:56,58
-This is the Chinese style.


52
0:1:56,58 --> 0:1:58,17
I think the girls appreciate
this one.


53
0:1:58,17 --> 0:2:1,73
And if it doesn't work out, you
can eat him for dinner.


54
0:2:1,73 --> 0:2:4,83
It sucks to feel like an alien
no matter where you go.


55
0:2:4,83 --> 0:2:6,9
Harry's been to almost
every Asian country.


56
0:2:6,9 --> 0:2:8,439
He lives in America.


57
0:2:8,439 --> 0:2:9,87
[? You never ?] feel at home.


58
0:2:9,87 --> 0:2:11,33
Everywhere he goes, outcast.


59
0:2:11,33 --> 0:2:12,53
He goes to Africa; they've
never seen


60
0:2:12,53 --> 0:2:13,79
Asian people before.


61
0:2:13,79 --> 0:2:14,92
He goes to fucking China.


62
0:2:14,92 --> 0:2:15,91
Everyone here looks like him.


63
0:2:15,91 --> 0:2:18,69
Or am I not seeing something?


64
0:2:18,69 --> 0:2:21,721
But I think he looks
like everyone else.


65
0:2:21,721 --> 0:2:23,264
They look at this
guy like he's a


66
0:2:23,264 --> 0:2:24,655
fucking alien or something.


67
0:2:24,655 --> 0:2:26,836
[INAUDIBLE] want to cry
right now, dude.


68
0:2:26,836 --> 0:2:27,272
-It's you.


69
0:2:27,272 --> 0:2:29,8
-Dude, I'm so fucking
bummed out for you.


70
0:2:29,8 --> 0:2:31,63



71
0:2:31,63 --> 0:2:36,97
China's like a 1950s America
with freeways being built,


72
0:2:36,97 --> 0:2:38,0
small towns--


73
0:2:38,0 --> 0:2:40,11
these little empty towns
being built everywhere.


74
0:2:40,11 --> 0:2:44,3
And Harry's like the Filipino
Michael J. Fox coming back


75
0:2:44,3 --> 0:2:45,45
from the future.


76
0:2:45,45 --> 0:2:47,75
And the people out here--


77
0:2:47,75 --> 0:2:48,94
they don't understand him yet.


78
0:2:48,94 --> 0:2:50,29
They don't appreciate it.


79
0:2:50,29 --> 0:2:51,54
But their kids will.


80
0:2:51,54 --> 0:3:5,41



81
0:3:5,41 --> 0:3:7,79
We started our trip
here in Beijing.


82
0:3:7,79 --> 0:3:9,85
This is all of China.


83
0:3:9,85 --> 0:3:12,18
Me and Harry, we don't speak
the fucking language.


84
0:3:12,18 --> 0:3:13,9
We don't know where we are.


85
0:3:13,9 --> 0:3:14,86
We don't know where
we're going.


86
0:3:14,86 --> 0:3:18,66
I guess we're look at this right
now, and we went into


87
0:3:18,66 --> 0:3:19,95
inner Mongolia.


88
0:3:19,95 --> 0:3:22,54
And now we're in--


89
0:3:22,54 --> 0:3:23,59
how you say that?


90
0:3:23,59 --> 0:3:26,2
Zhengzhou, in the
Henan territory.


91
0:3:26,2 --> 0:3:28,8
And we're trying to cross
the entire country.


92
0:3:28,8 --> 0:3:33,6
So we're trying to either get
to Hong Kong, Macau, any of


93
0:3:33,6 --> 0:3:35,8
these countries down here.


94
0:3:35,8 --> 0:3:36,42
What do you think?


95
0:3:36,42 --> 0:3:38,32
What do you think
we should do?


96
0:3:38,32 --> 0:3:42,28
-I think we should go to the
coastline to Shanghai and then


97
0:3:42,28 --> 0:3:43,92
go south right here.


98
0:3:43,92 --> 0:3:47,71
Beaches, bitches, dark
skin, good food.


99
0:3:47,71 --> 0:3:48,145
What do you think?


100
0:3:48,145 --> 0:3:49,43
-That sounds good.


101
0:3:49,43 --> 0:3:49,77
I like that.


102
0:3:49,77 --> 0:3:51,13
-I want to go this way.


103
0:3:51,13 --> 0:3:53,12
-Why the fuck you want
to go that way?


104
0:3:53,12 --> 0:3:55,78
-I like the squiggly
line right here.


105
0:3:55,78 --> 0:3:58,49
-What about bitches
and beaches?


106
0:3:58,49 --> 0:4:3,64
-Harry, if we go that way,
Stephanie knows people.


107
0:4:3,64 --> 0:4:5,59
All her friends are
super horny.


108
0:4:5,59 --> 0:4:6,97
I heard their music's good.


109
0:4:6,97 --> 0:4:8,65
They got the hairy crab there.


110
0:4:8,65 --> 0:4:10,13
They got the soup dumplings.


111
0:4:10,13 --> 0:4:11,4
-Hairy crab.


112
0:4:11,4 --> 0:4:12,65
-And you want to go this
way 'cause the line--


113
0:4:12,65 --> 0:4:13,55
-I want to go this way.


114
0:4:13,55 --> 0:4:14,61
-'Cause the line's squiggly.


115
0:4:14,61 --> 0:4:16,189
-'Cause I like the
squiggly line.


116
0:4:16,189 --> 0:4:18,185
-What squiggly line?


117
0:4:18,185 --> 0:4:19,435
What?


118
0:4:19,435 --> 0:4:21,68



119
0:4:21,68 --> 0:4:23,31
-You want to go this way 'cause
the line's squiggly.


120
0:4:23,31 --> 0:4:25,21
-Yeah, I want to go this way.


121
0:4:25,21 --> 0:4:26,93
I want go that way.


122
0:4:26,93 --> 0:4:28,56
Yeah, 'cause, yeah.


123
0:4:28,56 --> 0:4:30,716
-You're splitting up the team.


124
0:4:30,716 --> 0:4:32,26
-It's Shanghai or bust.


125
0:4:32,26 --> 0:4:35,76



126
0:4:35,76 --> 0:4:38,31
-I mean, I'm sorry.


127
0:4:38,31 --> 0:4:39,83
I mean, if Harry wants
to go that way, it's


128
0:4:39,83 --> 0:4:41,23
got to be bros versus--


129
0:4:41,23 --> 0:4:42,635
you know, bros come--


130
0:4:42,635 --> 0:4:43,39
-You just said [INAUDIBLE].


131
0:4:43,39 --> 0:4:45,81
-Bros come before hoes.


132
0:4:45,81 --> 0:4:46,64
I'm sorry.


133
0:4:46,64 --> 0:4:51,5
But listen, you're--


134
0:4:51,5 --> 0:4:53,52
-Always get your fucking way.


135
0:4:53,52 --> 0:4:55,75
-I fucking heard you.


136
0:4:55,75 --> 0:4:56,795
You were talking to your
boyfriend last


137
0:4:56,795 --> 0:4:59,4
night on the telephone.


138
0:4:59,4 --> 0:5:2,9
You're going back 'cause you
want to see your boyfriend.


139
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:3,882
-I have boyfriends in
every fucking city.


140
0:5:3,882 --> 0:5:5,5
Give me a fucking break.


141
0:5:5,5 --> 0:5:6,75
I'm a big girl now.


142
0:5:6,75 --> 0:5:9,48



143
0:5:9,48 --> 0:5:9,8
-No, no, no.


144
0:5:9,8 --> 0:5:11,93
Let's not end this angry.


145
0:5:11,93 --> 0:5:15,23
If you come with us, there
will be action, adventure


146
0:5:15,23 --> 0:5:15,8
around every corner.


147
0:5:15,8 --> 0:5:18,24
It might not be the
most exciting way.


148
0:5:18,24 --> 0:5:20,88
But if you go back--


149
0:5:20,88 --> 0:5:22,54
I can see it in your eyes.


150
0:5:22,54 --> 0:5:24,28
You're going to go
back to work.


151
0:5:24,28 --> 0:5:25,48
You want to see your
boyfriend.


152
0:5:25,48 --> 0:5:26,27
I understand that.


153
0:5:26,27 --> 0:5:27,4
I understand that.


154
0:5:27,4 --> 0:5:31,7
But you will regret it for
the rest of your life.


155
0:5:31,7 --> 0:5:32,28
-I said go coastal.


156
0:5:32,28 --> 0:5:34,2
I'm going coastal.


157
0:5:34,2 --> 0:5:34,84
-Listen.


158
0:5:34,84 --> 0:5:35,87
Listen, listen, listen.


159
0:5:35,87 --> 0:5:36,696
Come here.


160
0:5:36,696 --> 0:5:38,67
If that's the way you want
to go, we'll just


161
0:5:38,67 --> 0:5:39,76
let you go that way.


162
0:5:39,76 --> 0:5:44,5
And we've had an amazing
adventure so far.


163
0:5:44,5 --> 0:5:47,0
We've seen and done things.


164
0:5:47,0 --> 0:5:50,5
When you're back to your regular
life in Shanghai,


165
0:5:50,5 --> 0:5:53,41
you'll regret not being on the
road with me and Harry.


166
0:5:53,41 --> 0:5:55,95
Guaranteed, you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.


167
0:5:55,95 --> 0:5:59,28
But it's your life.


168
0:5:59,28 --> 0:6:1,9
It's your prerogative You
can do what you want.


169
0:6:1,9 --> 0:6:4,23
So god bless this trip so far.


170
0:6:4,23 --> 0:6:8,19
And please look out for us
for the rest of this


171
0:6:8,19 --> 0:6:10,45
trip, on this journey.


172
0:6:10,45 --> 0:6:12,485
I'm sure our paths will
cross again one day.


173
0:6:12,485 --> 0:6:15,16



174
0:6:15,16 --> 0:6:16,53
I love the both of you.


175
0:6:16,53 --> 0:6:17,92
But in the end, I
choose Harry.


176
0:6:17,92 --> 0:6:19,17
I'm sorry.


177
0:6:19,17 --> 0:6:20,846
You're going to be all right?


178
0:6:20,846 --> 0:6:21,31
All right.


179
0:6:21,31 --> 0:6:21,772
Group hug.


180
0:6:21,772 --> 0:6:23,16
-Bye, Stephanie.


181
0:6:23,16 --> 0:6:23,88
-Love you guys.


182
0:6:23,88 --> 0:6:24,3
-Love you too.


183
0:6:24,3 --> 0:6:25,18
-Love you too.


184
0:6:25,18 --> 0:6:26,25
-I want to fist you both.


185
0:6:26,25 --> 0:6:27,5
-[LAUGHTER]


186
0:6:27,5 --> 0:6:28,75
-All right, I'll
see you later.


187
0:6:28,75 --> 0:6:42,39



188
0:6:42,39 --> 0:6:45,39
Dude, your sister's starting
to look kind of cute, man.


189
0:6:45,39 --> 0:6:47,35
-Yeah.


190
0:6:47,35 --> 0:6:49,31
-Dude, you fucked her, huh?


191
0:6:49,31 --> 0:6:50,78
You fucked her, dude.


192
0:6:50,78 --> 0:6:52,3
Let's get out of here.


193
0:6:52,3 --> 0:6:56,66



194
0:6:56,66 --> 0:7:11,93
[LAUGHS]


195
0:7:11,93 --> 0:7:13,86
-The road is like a woman.


196
0:7:13,86 --> 0:7:14,615
It's very temperamental.


197
0:7:14,615 --> 0:7:16,32
It's very moody.


198
0:7:16,32 --> 0:7:19,52
One day it can be like a cold
hard bitch, make you sleep on


199
0:7:19,52 --> 0:7:22,68
the couch, don't let you hang
out with your friends.


200
0:7:22,68 --> 0:7:26,31
And sometimes, she can be the
most kindest, loving--


201
0:7:26,31 --> 0:7:30,17
make you a homemade apple pie
and leave it on the windowsill


202
0:7:30,17 --> 0:7:33,225
for you, and draw you a
bath, scrub your dick


203
0:7:33,225 --> 0:7:35,8
and balls for you.


204
0:7:35,8 --> 0:7:36,61
Give you a blow job as you
come out of the shower.


205
0:7:36,61 --> 0:7:40,2



206
0:7:40,2 --> 0:7:40,83
-Love you guys.


207
0:7:40,83 --> 0:7:41,32
-Love you too.


208
0:7:41,32 --> 0:7:41,96
-Love you too.


209
0:7:41,96 --> 0:7:43,31
-I want to fist you both.


210
0:7:43,31 --> 0:7:45,95
-We lost a family
member today.


211
0:7:45,95 --> 0:7:49,84
And it's back to the old team--
me and Harry, which is


212
0:7:49,84 --> 0:7:50,56
sort of exciting.


213
0:7:50,56 --> 0:7:54,25
But then at the same time, we've
been extremely spoiled


214
0:7:54,25 --> 0:7:55,2
on this trip.


215
0:7:55,2 --> 0:7:58,16
We had a woman with us,
Harry's sister.


216
0:7:58,16 --> 0:8:2,61
And we never waited longer than
five minutes, maybe no


217
0:8:2,61 --> 0:8:5,5
longer than three minutes
for a ride.


218
0:8:5,5 --> 0:8:7,99
If you're a woman, you will
never, ever in your life have


219
0:8:7,99 --> 0:8:9,74
a problem getting picked up.


220
0:8:9,74 --> 0:8:14,42
However, 99.9 percent of the
people that pick you up will


221
0:8:14,42 --> 0:8:17,98
either be thinking of doing
horrible things to you or try


222
0:8:17,98 --> 0:8:19,74
to do horrible things to you.


223
0:8:19,74 --> 0:8:21,61
So it's good to have
a guy with you.


224
0:8:21,61 --> 0:8:25,57
I guess that's the sucky part
of having tits, 'cause guys


225
0:8:25,57 --> 0:8:27,38
are such perverts and creeps.


226
0:8:27,38 --> 0:8:31,7
But we love you, Stephanie.


227
0:8:31,7 --> 0:8:32,95
Let's get out of here.


228
0:8:32,95 --> 0:8:43,158



229
0:8:43,158 --> 0:8:43,657

-Ah.


235
0:8:48,7 --> 0:8:49,64
-Ah.


236
0:8:49,64 --> 0:8:51,22
We just stayed on the
roof tonight.


237
0:8:51,22 --> 0:8:52,71
So sorry for--


238
0:8:52,71 --> 0:8:54,88
I didn't see you last night.


239
0:8:54,88 --> 0:8:56,2
We just sleep a little bit.


240
0:8:56,2 --> 0:8:56,54
-Yes.


241
0:8:56,54 --> 0:8:57,845
-Yeah.

245
0:9:7,7 --> 0:9:11,9
-Harry doesn't know what
anyone's saying to him.


246
0:9:11,9 --> 0:9:14,66



247
0:9:14,66 --> 0:9:16,34
I know what you're
thinking, dude.


248
0:9:16,34 --> 0:9:19,43
She's way too young
for you, dude.


249
0:9:19,43 --> 0:9:20,974
-But she could always
fuck my head.

[CHUCKLES]


251
0:9:28,49 --> 0:9:29,41
-Bye bye.


252
0:9:29,41 --> 0:9:30,41
This is what I'm
talking about.


253
0:9:30,41 --> 0:9:32,475
Like even in all the zombie
towns where it's abandoned,


254
0:9:32,475 --> 0:9:35,19
there's like always like
one person somewhere.


255
0:9:35,19 --> 0:9:37,45
It's like, I don't know how many
times we've been caught


256
0:9:37,45 --> 0:9:38,87
taking a shit or masturbating
on this trip.


257
0:9:38,87 --> 0:9:41,69



258
0:9:41,69 --> 0:9:42,84
Still in Zhengzhou.


259
0:9:42,84 --> 0:9:45,6
We're going to try to head south
and hit Wuhan today.


260
0:9:45,6 --> 0:9:48,95
And I guess the reason why
we're going to do that is


261
0:9:48,95 --> 0:9:51,41
because it's a squiggly
line, and Wuhan


262
0:9:51,41 --> 0:9:52,66
falls on that squiggle.


263
0:9:52,66 --> 0:10:5,99



264
0:10:5,99 --> 0:10:7,9
We're going to put
some work in.


265
0:10:7,9 --> 0:10:9,965
Come on, Harry.


266
0:10:9,965 --> 0:10:11,215
Do it like you want it.


267
0:10:11,215 --> 0:10:16,75



268
0:10:16,75 --> 0:10:17,706
Oh!


269
0:10:17,706 --> 0:10:18,52
Get your bag.


270
0:10:18,52 --> 0:10:19,77
Get your bag.


271
0:10:19,77 --> 0:10:41,14



272
0:10:41,14 --> 0:10:42,49
All right.


273
0:10:42,49 --> 0:10:43,71
That's Harry.


274
0:10:43,71 --> 0:10:45,34
That's me.


275
0:10:45,34 --> 0:10:50,48
That's us floating down
the Yangtze River.


276
0:10:50,48 --> 0:10:51,59
Deja vu.


277
0:10:51,59 --> 0:10:53,52
It's not just the place where
you can see naked ladies.


278
0:10:53,52 --> 0:10:55,72
It's also the feeling I'm
having right now.


279
0:10:55,72 --> 0:10:56,45
I'm getting older.


280
0:10:56,45 --> 0:10:57,68
My memory's not so good.


281
0:10:57,68 --> 0:10:59,12
I don't remember what
I did yesterday.


282
0:10:59,12 --> 0:11:2,7
I don't remember what I did
the day before yesterday.


283
0:11:2,7 --> 0:11:7,955
But what I do remember is a few
years ago, me and my man


284
0:11:7,955 --> 0:11:11,29
Harry, we floated down the
Mississippi River.


285
0:11:11,29 --> 0:11:15,0
And I will never, ever forget
that for the rest of my life.


286
0:11:15,0 --> 0:11:18,78
If I had died on that river, I
would have lived a good life.


287
0:11:18,78 --> 0:11:20,98
But I'm alive and
I'm still going.


288
0:11:20,98 --> 0:11:27,684
And now we challenge China and
this great Chinese adventure.


289
0:11:27,684 --> 0:11:29,45
Pumping up our boat?


290
0:11:29,45 --> 0:11:29,755
-That's right.


291
0:11:29,755 --> 0:11:31,261
-I'm with my man Harry.


292
0:11:31,261 --> 0:11:32,515
What else do I got to say?


293
0:11:32,515 --> 0:11:37,385



294
0:11:37,385 --> 0:11:39,14
[INAUDIBLE] the Yangtze River.


295
0:11:39,14 --> 0:11:42,46
It's the third largest river
in the entire world.


296
0:11:42,46 --> 0:11:44,135
It starts in Tibet.


297
0:11:44,135 --> 0:11:47,74
It invades every orifice of
China-- the mouth, the pussy,


298
0:11:47,74 --> 0:11:48,81
the asshole.


299
0:11:48,81 --> 0:11:51,4
And then it empties out into
the East China Sea.


300
0:11:51,4 --> 0:11:53,81
Every single person we talked to
said, once again, we're the


301
0:11:53,81 --> 0:11:54,64
biggest fucking idiots.


302
0:11:54,64 --> 0:11:56,22
It's super dangerous.


303
0:11:56,22 --> 0:11:59,68
There's huge barges and shit
going down near the city.


304
0:11:59,68 --> 0:12:1,91
There's sinkholes.


305
0:12:1,91 --> 0:12:5,15
All right, everyone say
hello our cameraman.


306
0:12:5,15 --> 0:12:8,15
Me and Harry's fat asses are
filling out the weight on this


307
0:12:8,15 --> 0:12:10,53
tiny vessel to maximum
capacity.


308
0:12:10,53 --> 0:12:13,6
So we're going to film our own
shit, and hopefully we'll see


309
0:12:13,6 --> 0:12:15,97
you alive and well
in the next city.


310
0:12:15,97 --> 0:12:17,22
Thumbs up, China.


311
0:12:17,22 --> 0:12:37,356



312
0:12:37,356 --> 0:12:39,61

313
0:12:39,61 --> 0:12:43,5
We got dropped off in
[INAUDIBLE] outskirts of Wuhan

0:12:43,5 --> 0:12:46,62
from Zhengzhou.


315
0:12:46,62 --> 0:12:48,92
The air quality in China's
fucking horrible.


316
0:12:48,92 --> 0:12:51,56
So I don't know if you can even
see this, but it looks


317
0:12:51,56 --> 0:12:53,44
like there's the city.


318
0:12:53,44 --> 0:12:54,9
As you can see how everyone
said this


319
0:12:54,9 --> 0:12:55,97
was a dangerous river.


320
0:12:55,97 --> 0:12:57,77
I mean, I guess it is dangerous
'cause there's all


321
0:12:57,77 --> 0:13:1,82

boats and shit around our


322
0:13:1,82 --> 0:13:2,91

323
0:13:2,91 --> 0:13:6,35
But there's absolutely
no fucking current.


324
0:13:6,35 --> 0:13:11,8
Me and Harry are cruising along
at zero miles per hour.


325
0:13:11,8 --> 0:13:13,4
Hopefully, we can hitch a ride
on one of these little boats


326
0:13:13,4 --> 0:13:15,2
and go a little bit faster,
but we'll see.


327
0:13:15,2 --> 0:13:17,952

this island right here.

-It feels good.


336
0:13:33,28 --> 0:13:34,71

And so they have agreed to
take us into the city.


417
0:16:20,79 --> 0:16:24,6
Once again, life does not
get better than this.


418
0:16:24,6 --> 0:16:25,9
I'm with my man Harry.


419
0:16:25,9 --> 0:16:28,13
I would have much rather been
with his wife with the hot


420
0:16:28,13 --> 0:16:32,29
pink blouse, but she wanted
nothing to do with us, and now


421
0:16:32,29 --> 0:16:34,11
we're with this salty
old fuck.


422
0:16:34,11 --> 0:16:36,16
We're speeding down the river.


423
0:16:36,16 --> 0:16:37,616
Life is good.


424
0:16:37,616 --> 0:16:38,866
Catch you later.


425
0:16:38,866 --> 0:16:51,3



426
0:16:51,3 --> 0:16:53,239
-Oh, we're slowing down.


427
0:16:53,239 --> 0:16:56,173
-Looks like his boat's having
some technical difficulties.


428
0:16:56,173 --> 0:17:2,53



429
0:17:2,53 --> 0:17:3,19
-What's he looking for?


430
0:17:3,19 --> 0:17:4,98
-I don't know.


431
0:17:4,98 --> 0:17:5,91
Stay out of his way, though.


432
0:17:5,91 --> 0:17:6,91
Oh, gas.


433
0:17:6,91 --> 0:17:8,16
-He ran out of some gas.


434
0:17:8,16 --> 0:17:10,41



435
0:17:10,41 --> 0:17:12,41
Shit, man.


436
0:17:12,41 --> 0:17:15,869
If his boat breaks down, he'll
be riding the Challenger into


437
0:17:15,869 --> 0:17:16,8
shore with us.


438
0:17:16,8 --> 0:17:18,672
I don't think there's room
on there for three of us.


439
0:17:18,672 --> 0:17:20,76
Can you swim?


440
0:17:20,76 --> 0:17:21,95
-All right.


441
0:17:21,95 --> 0:17:25,13
-I don't understand anything
this guy's said to us so far.


442
0:17:25,13 --> 0:17:27,221
He still gave us the
ride even though he


443
0:17:27,221 --> 0:17:28,329
fucking hates our guts.


444
0:17:28,329 --> 0:17:32,186
Looks like we're in a pretty
industrious area, and there's


445
0:17:32,186 --> 0:17:34,16
all these apartment buildings
and shit being built over


446
0:17:34,16 --> 0:17:35,73
there, so I'm guessing
we're in Wuhan.


447
0:17:35,73 --> 0:17:36,98
I can't be sure.


448
0:17:36,98 --> 0:17:40,47



449
0:17:40,47 --> 0:17:41,64
-Xie xie.


450
0:17:41,64 --> 0:17:42,25
Xie xie.


451
0:17:42,25 --> 0:17:43,24
-Bye bye.


452
0:17:43,24 --> 0:17:43,94
-Bye.


453
0:17:43,94 --> 0:17:45,15
-Hey, look at that, dude.


454
0:17:45,15 --> 0:17:47,28
We got a smile at the
end of the ride from


455
0:17:47,28 --> 0:17:48,6
our salty old friend.


456
0:17:48,6 --> 0:17:49,996
He wasn't such an asshole
after all.


457
0:17:49,996 --> 0:17:51,74
Well, actually, you
were the asshole.


458
0:17:51,74 --> 0:17:52,34
-Yeah.


459
0:17:52,34 --> 0:17:55,51
-We just gave him our futuristic
boat craft, and now


460
0:17:55,51 --> 0:17:56,76
we're in fucking Wuhan.


461
0:17:56,76 --> 0:18:2,426



462
0:18:2,426 --> 0:18:3,398
Look.


463
0:18:3,398 --> 0:18:6,235
We finally found some
graffiti in China.


464
0:18:6,235 --> 0:18:8,47
I can't read what it says, but
I think it's graffiti.


465
0:18:8,47 --> 0:18:27,95



466
0:18:27,95 --> 0:18:29,2
Yeah, Harry.

that I just bought, 'cause I'm

wow.

-Me and Harry jamming
by the river.

Thumbs up, China.

Thumbs up, everybody.


485
0:19:37,88 --> 0:19:40,2
I got a little bit
of bad news.


486
0:19:40,2 --> 0:19:42,4
We just got to the city Wuhan.


487
0:19:42,4 --> 0:19:43,3
It's a big city.


488
0:19:43,3 --> 0:19:44,59
It's like one of the
big cities after


489
0:19:44,59 --> 0:19:45,83
Shanghai and Beijing.


490
0:19:45,83 --> 0:19:50,2
We're trying to track
down our cameraman.


491
0:19:50,2 --> 0:19:52,39
We're trying to track down--


492
0:19:52,39 --> 0:19:53,64
Harry just fucking--


493
0:19:53,64 --> 0:19:56,7
Jesus Christ, man.


494
0:19:56,7 --> 0:19:59,62
I went to the bathroom for one
second, and Harry disappeared.


495
0:19:59,62 --> 0:20:0,94
I don't know where he is.


496
0:20:0,94 --> 0:20:1,82
He doesn't have a phone.


497
0:20:1,82 --> 0:20:3,36
There's no way to get
a hold of him.


498
0:20:3,36 --> 0:20:4,22
I just--


499
0:20:4,22 --> 0:20:5,3
fuck, man.


500
0:20:5,3 --> 0:20:6,49
I fucking hate that guy, man.


501
0:20:6,49 --> 0:20:10,485
He just pisses me--


502
0:20:10,485 --> 0:20:11,24
All right, hold up.


503
0:20:11,24 --> 0:20:12,35
I'm going to find him.


504
0:20:12,35 --> 0:20:13,26
Don't worry, everybody.


505
0:20:13,26 --> 0:20:14,51
We'll get him back.


506
0:20:14,51 --> 0:20:16,87



507
0:20:16,87 --> 0:20:20,43
We'll check every eatery and the
shitter around here, and


508
0:20:20,43 --> 0:20:22,54
hopefully we'll be
able to find him.


509
0:20:22,54 --> 0:20:24,464
I don't know where he is.


510
0:20:24,464 --> 0:20:25,907
I don't know where
he could be.

518
0:20:44,87 --> 0:20:54,51



519
0:20:54,51 --> 0:20:57,53
Every time I get to a good place
with this guy, he does


520
0:20:57,53 --> 0:20:58,47
something to fuck it up.


521
0:20:58,47 --> 0:20:59,876
You know what I mean.


522
0:20:59,876 --> 0:21:5,416
If me and Harry were a gay
couple-- if we were--


523
0:21:5,416 --> 0:21:7,71
I would have divorced
or broken up.


524
0:21:7,71 --> 0:21:10,29
We would be the make up,
break up couple.


525
0:21:10,29 --> 0:21:13,47
I mean, we just had an amazing
day on the river.


526
0:21:13,47 --> 0:21:14,555
Our cameraman called.


527
0:21:14,555 --> 0:21:15,55
We were going to meet
up with him.


528
0:21:15,55 --> 0:21:17,95
And the guy just--


529
0:21:17,95 --> 0:21:18,32
you can't keep track--


530
0:21:18,32 --> 0:21:19,71
the guy's like a--


531
0:21:19,71 --> 0:21:22,48
but then you can't get mad at
him either, 'cause he lacks


532
0:21:22,48 --> 0:21:23,59
common sense.


533
0:21:23,59 --> 0:21:24,31
He's like a dog.

You can't get mad at a dog.

He's like a little cute puppy
that's really disgusting and


536
0:21:30,91 --> 0:21:32,16
gross sometimes.

0:21:32,16 --> 0:21:43,392

0:21:43,392 --> 0:21:47,21
It started raining right
as we lost Harry.


539
0:21:47,21 --> 0:21:51,5
We found out he--


540
0:21:51,5 --> 0:21:52,61
this fucking--


541
0:21:52,61 --> 0:21:55,12
we got a strange call
from a strange phone


542
0:21:55,12 --> 0:21:56,54
number from this girl.


543
0:21:56,54 --> 0:21:59,61
He's at the roof of a
love hotel in Wuhan.


544
0:21:59,61 --> 0:22:1,852
So we're heading there now.

into the trip.

0:23:24,13 --> 0:23:25,48

0:23:25,48 --> 0:23:26,44
We have the cameraman.


557
0:23:26,44 --> 0:23:29,77
Everyone on the crew's looking
for Harry all day today.


558
0:23:29,77 --> 0:23:31,47
He met this nice girl Sheeka.

0:23:31,47 --> 0:23:34,35
This is Sheeka, everyone.

time today.

And I guess halfway through
their wonderful day together,


562
0:23:40,8 --> 0:23:41,82
a dude shows up.


563
0:23:41,82 --> 0:23:45,1
Turns out it's her pimp.


564
0:23:45,1 --> 0:23:48,88
And he's not happy that
she went missing too.


565

with women.

smaller than the dude.

out of you, then you have

0:24:14,9 --> 0:24:16,71
to let her go and
come with us.
