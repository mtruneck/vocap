###0 Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us here tonight. We have a lot of folks who’ve been
###32 waiting all day to talk to you, so I want to get right to it.
###35 Governor Romney, as you know, you won the coin toss, so the first question will go to
###39 you. And I want to turn to a first-time voter, Jeremy Epstein, who has a question for you.
###45 QUESTION: Mr. President, Governor Romney, as a 20-year-old college student, all I hear
###50 from professors, neighbors and others is that when I graduate, I will have little chance
###57 to get employment. What can you say to reassure me, but more importantly my parents, that
###62 I will be able to sufficiently support myself after I graduate?
###65 ROMNEY: Thank you, Jeremy. I appreciate your — your question, and thank you for being
###69 here this evening and to all of those from Nassau County that have come, thank you for
###73 your time. Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading
###78 this — this event. Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part
###81 of this — this debate. Your question — your question is one that’s
###85 being asked by college kids all over this country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone
###89 who had just graduated — this was in Philadelphia — and she said, “I’ve got my degree.
###94 I can’t find a job. I’ve got three part- time jobs. They’re just barely enough to
###98 pay for my food and pay for an apartment. I can’t begin to pay back my student loans.”
###103 So what we have to do is two things. We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids
###106 to afford college. ROMNEY: And also make sure that when they
###109 get out of college, there’s a job. When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a
###113 high school degree, you had to pass an exam. If you graduated in the top quarter of your
###118 airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the
###123 college of your choice in Massachusetts, it’s a public institution.
###127 I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing. We’re also going to have
###131 our loan program, so that people are able to afford school. But the key thing is to
###136 make sure you can get a job when you get out of school. And what’s happened over the
###139 last four years has been very, very hard for America’s young people. I want you to be
###144 able to get a job. I know what it takes to get this economy going.
###148 With half of college kids graduating this year without a college — excuse me, without
###153 a job. And without a college level job, that’s just unacceptable.
###157 And likewise you’ve got more and more debt on your back. So more debt and less jobs.
###161 I’m going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what
###166 it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across
###170 this country are going to recognize, we’re bringing back an economy.
###173 It’s not going to be like the last four years. The middle-class has been crushed over
###177 the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce. I know what it takes to bring them
###181 back, and I’m going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate — when do you
###186 graduate? QUESTION: 2014.
###186 ROMNEY: 2014. When you come out in 2014, I presume I’m going to be president. I’m
###189 going to make sure you get a job. Thanks Jeremy. Yeah, you bet.
###192 CROWLEY: Mr. President? OBAMA: Jeremy, first of all, your future is
###197 bright. And the fact that you’re making an investment in higher education is critical.
###202 Not just to you, but to the entire nation. Now, the most important thing we can do is
###208 to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country. But not just jobs, good paying
###213 jobs. Ones that can support a family. OBAMA: And what I want to do, is build on
###217 the five million jobs that we’ve created over the last 30 months in the private sector
###221 alone. And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.
###226 Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again. Now when Governor
###234 Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt. I said we’re going to bet on American workers
###239 and the American auto industry and it’s come surging back.
###242 I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and
###246 that means we change our tax code so we’re giving incentives to companies that are investing
###250 here in the United States and creating jobs here.
###253 It also means we’re helping them and small businesses to export all around the world
###258 to new markets. Number two, we’ve got to make sure that
###262 we have the best education system in the world. And the fact that you’re going to college
###266 is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we’ve worked hard to make
###270 sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure
###275 that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs
###279 that are out there right now and the jobs of the future.
###282 Number three, we’ve got to control our own energy. Now, not only oil and natural gas,
###288 which we’ve been investing in; but also, we’ve got to make sure we’re building
###292 the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from
###296 now, 20 years from now. That’s why we’ve invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy
###301 efficient cars. We’ve got to reduce our deficit, but we’ve
###304 got to do it in a balanced way. Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with
###307 cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.
###310 And let’s take the money that we’ve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild
###315 America, roads, bridges schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be
###320 bright but America’s future is going to bright as well.
###323 CROWLEY: Let me ask you for more immediate answer and begin with Mr. Romney just quickly
###329 what — what can you do? We’re looking at a situation where 40 percent of the unemployed
###335 have been unemployed have been unemployed for six months or more. They don’t have
###338 the two years that Jeremy has. What about those long term unemployed who
###343 need a job right now? ROMNEY: Well what you’re seeing in this
###346 country is 23 million people struggling to find a job. And a lot of them, as you say,
###351 Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time. The president’s policies have
###355 been exercised over the last four years and they haven’t put Americans back to work.
###360 We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office. If the
###365 — the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it’s 7.8 percent now.
###370 But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of
###374 the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent. We have not made the progress we need to make
###379 to put people back to work. That’s why I put out a five-point plan that gets America
###383 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay. It’s going to help Jeremy
###389 get a job when he comes out of school. It’s going to help people across the country that
###393 are unemployed right now. And one thing that the president said, which
###396 I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.
###402 And that’s right. My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven
###406 did and Macy’s and Condell (ph) Airlines and come out stronger.
###411 And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt. Well, the president took
###415 Detroit bankrupt. You took General Motors bankrupt. You took Chrysler bankrupt. So when
###420 you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did.
###425 And I think it’s important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get
###429 those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people. That was precisely
###434 what I recommended and ultimately what happened. CROWLEY: Let me give the president a chance.
###438 Go ahead. OBAMA: Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn’t true. He wanted to take
###444 them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open. And we would have lost
###450 a million jobs. And that — don’t take my word for it, take the executives at GM
###459 and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney. But they’ll
###463 tell you his prescription wasn’t going to work.
###465 And Governor Romney’s says he’s got a five-point plan? Governor Romney doesn’t
###469 have a five-point plan. He has a one-point plan. And that plan is to make sure that folks
###474 at the top play by a different set of rules. That’s been his philosophy in the private
###483 sector, that’s been his philosophy as governor, that’s been his philosophy as a presidential
###487 candidate. You can make a lot of money and pay lower
###494 tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less. You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks
###500 for it. You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their
###501 pensions, and you still make money. That’s exactly the philosophy that we’ve
###501 seen in place for the last decade. That’s what’s been squeezing middle class families.
###507 And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess. The last thing we need
###512 to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.
###516 CROWLEY: Mr. President, the next question is going to be for you here.
###519 And, Mr. Romney — Governor Romney — there’ll be plenty of chances here to go on, but I
###522 want to… ROMNEY: That — that Detroit — that Detroit
###523 answer… CROWLEY: We have all these folks.
###524 ROMNEY: … that Detroit answer… CROWLEY: I will let you absolutely…
###526 ROMNEY: … and the rest of the answer, way off the mark.
###528 CROWLEY: OK. Will — will — you certainly will have lots of time here coming up.
###532 Because I want to move you on to something that’s sort of connected to cars here, and
###536 — and go over. And we want to get a question from Phillip Tricolla.
###542 QUESTION: Your energy secretary, Steven Chu, has now been on record three times stating
###551 it’s not policy of his department to help lower gas prices. Do you agree with Secretary
###557 Chu that this is not the job of the Energy Department?
###561 OBAMA: The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.
###568 So here’s what I’ve done since I’ve been president. We have increased oil production
###573 to the highest levels in 16 years. Natural gas production is the highest it’s
###578 been in decades. We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment. But what
###587 I’ve also said is we can’t just produce traditional source of energy. We’ve also
###592 got to look to the future. That’s why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.
###596 That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you’re going to
###600 end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas. That’s why we doubled clean — clean energy
###605 production like wind and solar and biofuels. And all these things have contributed to us
###610 lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years. Now, I want to build on that.
###617 And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling. We continue
###623 to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas. We’ve got potentially 600,000 jobs
###629 and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas.
###634 And we can do it in an environmentally sound way. But we’ve also got to continue to figure
###639 out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that’s how we’re going to reduce
###644 demand and that’s what’s going to keep gas prices lower.
###648 Now, Governor Romney will say he’s got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan
###653 is to let the oil companies write the energy policies. So he’s got the oil and gas part,
###662 but he doesn’t have the clean energy part. And if we are only thinking about tomorrow
###668 or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we’re not going to control
###673 our own economic future. Because China, Germany, they’re making these investments. And I’m
###679 not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries. I expect those new energy
###684 sources to be built right here in the United States.
###686 That’s going to help Jeremy get a job. It’s also going to make sure that you’re not
###690 paying as much for gas. CROWLEY: Governor, on the subject of gas prices?
###694 ROMNEY: Well, let’s look at the president’s policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric,
###699 because we’ve had four years of policies being played out. And the president’s right
###703 in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land. As a
###708 matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas
###713 production was down 9 percent. Why? Because the president cut in half the number of licenses
###718 and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.
###723 So where’d the increase come from? Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in
###726 North Dakota. What was his participation there? The administration brought a criminal action
###732 against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have. And what
###737 was the cost? 20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after
###743 them on a criminal basis. Look, I want to make sure we use our oil,
###747 our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. I believe very much in our renewable capabilities;
###754 ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.
###758 But what we don’t need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal
###763 and gas. This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal. Talk to the people that
###769 are working in those industries. I was in coal country. People grabbed my arms and said,
###774 “Please save my job.” The head of the EPA said, “You can’t build a coal plant.
###779 You’ll virtually — it’s virtually impossible given our regulations.” When the president
###783 ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you’ll go bankrupt.
###788 That’s not the right course for America. Let’s take advantage of the energy resources
###792 we have, as well as the energy sources for the future. And if we do that, if we do what
###797 I’m planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy
###803 independence within eight years, you’re going to see manufacturing jobs come back.
###809 Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant
###813 energy. I’ll get America and North America energy independent. I’ll do it by more drilling,
###819 more permits and licenses. We’re going to bring that pipeline in from
###823 Canada. How in the world the president said no to that pipeline? I will never know.
###827 This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that’s
###831 what I’m going to do. CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the gist
###835 of this question, which is, are we looking at the new normal? I can tell you that tomorrow
###840 morning, a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that
###842 the price of gas is over $4 a gallon. Is it within the purview of the government
###848 to bring those prices down, or are we looking at the new normal?
###852 OBAMA: Candy, there’s no doubt that world demand’s gone up, but our production is
###856 going up, and we’re using oil more efficiently. And very little of what Governor Romney just
###862 said is true. We’ve opened up public lands. We’re actually drilling more on public lands
###869 than in the previous administration and my — the previous president was an oil man.
###874 And natural gas isn’t just appearing magically. We’re encouraging it and working with the
###880 industry. And when I hear Governor Romney say he’s
###884 a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when — Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts,
###888 you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, “This plant kills,” and
###895 took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you’re a big champion of coal.
###901 So what I’ve tried to do is be consistent. With respect to something like coal, we made
###906 the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we’re producing
###911 more coal, we’re producing it cleaner and smarter. Same thing with oil, same thing with
###916 natural gas. And the proof is our oil imports are down
###920 to the lowest levels in 20 years. Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and,
###927 most importantly, we’re also starting to build cars that are more efficient.
###932 And that’s creating jobs. That means those cars can be exported, ‘cause that’s the
###935 demand around the world, and it also means that it’ll save money in your pocketbook.
###939 OBAMA: That’s the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that’s what
###942 we’re going to do in the next four years. ROMNEY: But that’s not what you’ve done
###946 in the last four years. That’s the problem. In the last four years, you cut permits and
###952 licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.
###954 OBAMA: Not true, Governor Romney. ROMNEY: So how much did you cut (inaudible)?
###957 OBAMA: Not true. ROMNEY: How much did you cut them by, then?
###959 OBAMA: Governor, we have actually produced more oil –
###960 ROMNEY: No, no. How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?
###964 OBAMA: Governor Romney, here’s what we did. There were a whole bunch of oil companies.
###968 (CROSSTALK) ROMNEY: No, no, I had a question and the question
###970 was how much did you cut them by? OBAMA: You want me to answer a question –
###972 ROMNEY: How much did you cut them by? OBAMA: I’m happy to answer the question.
###974 ROMNEY: All right. And it is – OBAMA: Here’s what happened. You had a whole
###977 bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren’t using. So what we
###983 said was you can’t just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to
###989 drill, when you want to produce, when it’s most profitable for you. These are public
###994 lands. So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.
###1000 ROMNEY: OK, (inaudible) – OBAMA: And so what we did was take away those
###1002 leases. And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.
###1006 ROMNEY: And production on private — on government land –
###1008 OBAMA: Production is up. ROMNEY: — is down.
###1009 OBAMA: No, it isn’t. ROMNEY: Production on government land of oil
###1011 is down 14 percent. OBAMA: Governor –
###1012 ROMNEY: And production on gas – (CROSSTALK)
###1013 OBAMA: It’s just not true. ROMNEY: It’s absolutely true. Look, there’s
###1017 no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal
###1022 lands and in federal waters. And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.
###1027 I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs. The right course
###1032 for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy. I don’t think anyone really believes
###1038 that you’re a person who’s going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal. You’ll
###1042 get your chance in a moment. I’m still speaking. OBAMA: Well –
###1044 ROMNEY: And the answer is I don’t believe people think that’s the case –
###1046 OBAMA: — (inaudible). ROMNEY: That wasn’t the question.
###1048 OBAMA: OK. ROMNEY: That was a statement. I don’t think
###1050 the American people believe that. I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas. And the proof,
###1055 the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you’re
###1059 paying at the pump. If you’re paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then,
###1064 the strategy is working. But you’re paying more. When the president took office, the
###1068 price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon. Now, it’s $4.00 a
###1071 gallon. The price of electricity is up. If the president’s energy policies are working,
###1078 you’re going to see the cost of energy come down. I will fight to create more energy in
###1083 this country, to get America energy secure. And part of that is bringing in a pipeline
###1088 of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore
###1093 in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it. Those things will get
###1098 us the energy we need. CROWLEY: Mr. President, could you address,
###1100 because we did finally get to gas prices here, could you address what the governor said,
###1106 which is if your energy policy was working, the price of gasoline would not be $4 a gallon
###1112 here. Is that true? OBAMA: Well, think about what the governor
###1113 — think about what the governor just said. He said when I took office, the price of gasoline
###1117 was $1.80, $1.86. Why is that? Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because
###1125 we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence
###1130 of some of the same policies that Governor Romney’s now promoting.
###1134 So, it’s conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his
###1138 policies, we might be back in that same mess. What I want to do is to create an economy
###1145 that is strong, and at the same time produce energy. And with respect to this pipeline
###1151 that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we’ve — we’ve built enough pipeline
###1156 to wrap around the entire earth once. So, I’m all for pipelines. I’m all for
###1163 oil production. What I’m not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation. So, for example,
###1168 on wind energy, when Governor Romney says “these are imaginary jobs.” When you’ve
###1173 got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating
###1180 wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that — in
###1186 Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says
###1193 I’m opposed. I’d get rid of it. That’s not an energy strategy for the future.
###1197 And we need to win that future. And I intend to win it as President of the United States.
###1200 CROWLEY: I got to — I got to move you on –
###1202 ROMNEY: He gets the first – CROWLEY: — and the next question –
###1203 ROMNEY: He actually got – CROWLEY: — for you –
###1204 ROMNEY: He actually got the first question. So I get the last question — last answer
###1206 – CROWLEY: (Inaudible) in the follow up, it
###1208 doesn’t quite work like that. But I’m going to give you a chance here. I promise
###1212 you, I’m going to. And the next question is for you. So if you
###1215 want to, you know, continue on — but I don’t want to leave all –
###1218 ROMNEY: Candy, Candy – CROWLEY: — sitting here –
###1219 ROMNEY: Candy, I don’t have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that — they’re
###1224 not phantom jobs. They’re real jobs. CROWLEY: OK.
###1226 ROMNEY: I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country. I appreciate the jobs
###1231 in coal and oil and gas. I’m going to make sure –
###1234 CROWLEY: OK. ROMNEY: — we’re taking advantage of our
###1236 energy resources. We’ll bring back manufacturing to America. We’re going to get through a
###1241 very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million more jobs in this country. It’s critical
###1245 to our future. OBAMA: Candy, it’s not going to –
###1247 CROWLEY: We’re going to move you along – OBAMA: Used to being interrupted.
###1249 CROWLEY: We’re going to move you both along to taxes over here and all these folks that
###1254 have been waiting. Governor, this question is for you. It comes
###1257 from Mary Follano — Follano, sorry. ROMNEY: Hi, Mary.
###1261 QUESTION: Governor Romney, you have stated that if you’re elected president, you would
###1266 plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax brackets and that you would work with the
###1271 Congress to eliminate some deductions in order to make up for the loss in revenue.
###1278 Concerning the — these various deductions, the mortgage deductions, the charitable deductions,
###1285 the child tax credit and also the — oh, what’s that other credit? I forgot.
###1290 OBAMA: You’re doing great. QUESTION: Oh, I remember.
###1296 The education credits, which are important to me, because I have children in college.
###1301 What would be your position on those things, which are important to the middle class?
###1304 ROMNEY: Thank you very much. And let me tell you, you’re absolutely right about part
###1309 of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and
###1315 I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes.
###1320 And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income
###1324 taxpayers have been buried over the past four years. You’ve seen, as middle-income people
###1329 in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone
###1335 up $2,000. Health insurance premiums, up $2,500. Food prices up. Utility prices up.
###1343 The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years. So
###1347 I want to get some relief to middle-income families. That’s part — that’s part
###1351 one. Now, how about deductions? ‘Cause I’m
###1353 going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I’m going to limit deductions
###1358 and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going
###1363 to have people at the high end pay less than they’re paying now.
###1366 The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation
###1373 collects. So that’ll stay the same. Middle-income people are going to get a tax
###1377 break. And so, in terms of bringing down deductions,
###1381 one way of doing that would be say everybody gets — I’ll pick a number — $25,000
###1385 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use. Your home mortgage interest
###1391 deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling
###1395 that bucket, if you will, of deductions. But your rate comes down and the burden also
###1400 comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer
###1406 will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains. No tax on your savings. That
###1413 makes life a lot easier. If you’re getting interest from a bank,
###1417 if you’re getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have,
###1422 you don’t have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there’ll be no taxes for
###1426 anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.
###1432 Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class? Because under the last four years, they’ve
###1436 been buried. And I want to help people in the middle-class.
###1439 And I will not — I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that’s being paid by the
###1445 highest income taxpayers. And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on
###1450 the middle-class. The president’s spending, the president’s borrowing will cost this
###1456 nation to have to raise taxes on the American people. Not just at the high end. A recent
###1460 study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes
###1465 as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.
###1468 I will not let that happen. I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I’m
###1473 going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families. And what’s that going to do? It’s
###1477 going to help those families, and it’s going to create incentives to start growing jobs
###1481 again in this country. CROWLEY: Thanks, Governor.
###1485 OBAMA: My philosophy on taxes has been simple. And that is, I want to give middle-class families
###1492 and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief. Because they have
###1497 been hit hard over the last decade. Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.
###1502 So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one. Actually it was a town hall,
###1505 and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that’s what I’ve done, by
###1511 $3,600.00. I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines
###1515 of growth. And we’ve cut them 18 times. And I want to continue those tax cuts for
###1522 middle-class families, and for small business. But what I’ve also said is, if we’re serious
###1529 about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation,
###1536 then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we’ve also got to make sure that the wealthy
###1542 do a little bit more. So what I’ve said is, your first $250,000.00
###1546 worth of income, no change. And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent
###1554 of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase. I’m ready to sign that bill right
###1558 now. The only reason it’s not happening is because Governor Romney’s allies in Congress
###1563 have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.
###1569 But what I’ve also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when
###1575 Bill Clinton was president. We created 23 million new jobs. That’s part of what took
###1581 us from deficits to surplus. It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job
###1587 creation. Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.
###1592 He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like
###1599 you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody
###1604 making $50,000 year? And he said, “Yes, I think that’s fair.” Not only that, he
###1609 said, “I think that’s what grows the economy.” Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.
###1615 I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for
###1620 your kids going to college. I think that grows the economy. I think what grows the economy
###1625 is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who
###1629 fought for our country. That grows our economy. So we just have a different theory. And when
###1633 Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary
###1639 he stood on stage and said “I’m going to give tax cuts” — he didn’t say tax
###1644 rate cuts, he said “tax cuts to everybody,” including the top 1 percent, you should believe
###1649 him because that’s been his history. And that’s exactly the kind of top-down
###1654 economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy
###1659 that’s striving for everybody. CROWLEY: Governor Romney, I’m sure you’ve
###1663 got a reply there. (LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: You’re absolutely right.
###1667 You heard what I said about my tax plan. The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent,
###1672 as they do today. I’m not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people. I am looking to
###1677 cut taxes for middle-income people. And why do I want to bring rates down, and
###1682 at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end? Because
###1687 if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital
###1692 and hire people. And for me, this is about jobs. I want to
###1697 get America’s economy going again. Fifty-four percent of America’s workers work in businesses
###1703 that are taxed as individuals. So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses
###1709 are able to keep more money and hire more people.
###1711 For me, I look at what’s happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.
###1717 We can do better than this. We don’t have to settle for, how many months, 43 months
###1722 with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right
###1727 now. There are 3.5 million more women living in
###1730 poverty today than when the president took office.
###1733 We don’t have to live like this. We can get this economy going again. My five-point
###1738 plan does it. Energy independence for North America in five years. Opening up more trade,
###1743 particularly in Latin America. Cracking down on China when they cheat. Getting us to a
###1747 balanced budget. Fixing our training programs for our workers. And finally, championing
###1752 small business. I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.
###1757 I know how to make that happen. I spent my life in the private sector. I know why jobs
###1761 come and why they go. And they’re going now because of the policies of this administration.
###1766 CROWLEY: Governor, let me ask the president something about what you just said.
###1770 The governor says that he is not going to allow the top 5 percent, believe is what he
###1777 said, to have a tax cut, that it will all even out, that what he wants to do is give
###1781 that tax cut to the middle class. Settled? OBAMA: No, it’s not settled.
###1788 Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent. Along with what
###1797 he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do
###1802 in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion.
###1808 Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even
###1813 though the military’s not asking for them. That’s $7 trillion.
###1817 He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. That’s another
###1822 trillion dollars — that’s $8 trillion. Now, what he says is he’s going to make
###1829 sure that this doesn’t add to the deficit and he’s going to cut middleclass taxes.
###1834 But when he’s asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are
###1840 you going to close? He can’t tell you. The — the fact that he only has to pay 14
###1847 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher. He’s already taken that
###1852 off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we — we’re
###1857 not going to get money that way. We haven’t heard from the governor any specifics
###1863 beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays
###1868 for that. Now, Governor Romney was a very successful
###1872 investor. If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend
###1878 $7 or $8 trillion, and then we’re going to pay for it, but we can’t tell you until
###1885 maybe after the election how we’re going to do it, you wouldn’t take such a sketchy
###1889 deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn’t add up.
###1897 And — and what’s at stake here is one of two things, either Candy — this blows
###1902 up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending
###1908 that he’s talking about, $7 trillion – $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit
###1912 we already have. Or, alternatively, it’s got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions
###1918 for wealthy individuals, that — that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.
###1924 You’re going to be paying for it. You’re going to lose some deductions, and you can’t
###1928 buy the sales pitch. Nobody who’s looked at it that’s serious, actually believes
###1933 it adds up. CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me get — let
###1935 me get the governor in on this. And Governor, let’s — before we get into a…
###1939 ROMNEY: I — I… CROWLEY: …vast array of who says — what
###1942 study says what, if it shouldn’t add up. If somehow when you get in there, there isn’t
###1948 enough tax revenue coming in. If somehow the numbers don’t add up, would you be willing
###1953 to look again at a 20 percent… ROMNEY: Well of course they add up. I — I
###1959 was — I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget. I ran the
###1966 Olympics and balanced the budget. I ran the — the state of Massachusetts as a governor,
###1971 to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years. When we’re talking
###1976 about math that doesn’t add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four
###1981 years, $5 trillion? That’s math that doesn’t add up. We have — we have a president talking
###1987 about someone’s plan in a way that’s completely foreign to what my real plan is.
###1993 ROMNEY: And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he
###1999 said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half. Instead he’s doubled
###2003 it. We’ve gone from $10 trillion of national debt, to $16 trillion of national debt. If
###2010 the president were reelected, we’d go to almost $20 trillion of national debt. This
###2015 puts us on a road to Greece. I know what it takes to balance budgets. I’ve done it my
###2019 entire life. So for instance when he says, “Yours is a $5 trillion cut.” Well, no
###2024 it’s not. Because I’m offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of
###2029 the deductions. And…
###2030 CROWLEY: Governor, I’ve gotta — gotta — actually, I need to have you both (inaudible).
###2033 (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: I understand the stakes here. I understand
###2035 both of you. But I — I will get run out of town if I don’t…
###2038 (CROSSTALK) ROMNEY: And I just described — I just described
###2039 to you, Mr. President — I just described to you precisely how I’d do it which is
###2043 with a single number that people can put — and they can put they’re — they’re deductions
###2047 and credits… (CROSSTALK)
###2048 CROWLEY: Mr. President, we’re keeping track, I promise you. And Mr. President, the next
###2052 question is for you, so stay standing. OBAMA: Great. Looking forward to it.
###2054 And it’s Katherine Fenton, who has a question for you.
###2061 QUESTION: In what new ways to you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace,
###2067 specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts
###2071 earn? OBAMA: Well, Katherine, that’s a great question.
###2075 And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while
###2081 looking after two kids. And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to
###2088 make sure we got everything we needed. My grandmother, she started off as a secretary
###2095 in a bank. She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip. And she
###2100 worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling.
###2107 She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.
###2113 She didn’t complain. That’s not what you did in that generation. And this is one of
###2119 the reasons why one of the first — the first bill I signed was something called the Lily
###2124 Ledbetter bill. And it’s named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same
###2130 job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court
###2139 said that she couldn’t bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas
###2142 she had no way of finding out about it. So we fixed that. And that’s an example of
###2148 the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in
###2155 the family. This is not just a women’s issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class
###2161 issue, and that’s why we’ve got to fight for it.
###2164 It also means that we’ve got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to
###2169 afford a college education. Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell
###2173 Grants and other education accessible for young people.
###2178 Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that’s exactly what we’ve done. We’ve
###2181 expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across
###2185 the country. We did it by taking $60 billion that was going
###2189 to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let’s
###2196 just cut out the middleman. Let’s give the money directly to students.
###2198 And as a consequence, we’ve seen millions of young people be able to afford college,
###2203 and that’s going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that
###2206 marketplace. But we’ve got to enforce the laws, which
###2209 is what we are doing, and we’ve also got to make sure that in every walk of life we
###2215 do not tolerate discrimination. That’s been one of the hallmarks of my administration.
###2219 I’m going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.
###2224 CROWLEY: Governor Romney, pay equity for women? ROMNEY: Thank you. And important topic, and
###2230 one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state,
###2235 because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to
###2242 be men. And I — and I went to my staff, and I said,
###2244 “How come all the people for these jobs are — are all men.” They said, “Well,
###2246 these are the people that have the qualifications.” And I said, “Well, gosh, can’t we — can’t
###2250 we find some — some women that are also qualified?”
###2253 ROMNEY: And — and so we — we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds
###2259 that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.
###2261 I went to a number of women’s groups and said, “Can you help us find folks,” and
###2264 they brought us whole binders full of women. I was proud of the fact that after I staffed
###2269 my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all
###2275 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than
###2280 any other state in America. Now one of the reasons I was able to get so
###2284 many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort. But number
###2288 two, because I recognized that if you’re going to have women in the workforce that
###2291 sometimes you need to be more flexible. My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids
###2295 that were still in school. She said, I can’t be here until 7 or 8 o’clock
###2299 at night. I need to be able to get home at 5 o’clock so I can be there for making dinner
###2304 for my kids and being with them when they get home from school. So we said fine. Let’s
###2308 have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.
###2311 We’re going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I’m going
###2315 to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they’re going
###2320 to be anxious to hire women. In the — in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs. That’s
###2327 the net of what’s happened in the last four years. We’re still down 580,000 jobs. I
###2333 mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago.
###2338 What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so
###2343 strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into
###2348 their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities
###2354 that they would otherwise not be able to afford. This is what I have done. It’s what I look
###2359 forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a
###2364 working economy looks like. And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real
###2369 strong economy. An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.
###2377 An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can’t finds a job, or
###2383 a college level job, that’s not what we have to have. CROWLEY: Governor?
###2385 ROMNEY: I’m going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy
###2390 and by supporting women in the workforce. CROWLEY: Mr. President why don’t you get
###2394 in on this quickly, please? OBAMA: Katherine, I just want to point out
###2395 that when Governor Romney’s campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether
###2400 he supported it? He said, “I’ll get back to you.” And that’s not the kind of advocacy
###2405 that women need in any economy. Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing
###2412 on how women succeed in the workplace. For example, their healthcare. You know a major
###2419 difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians
###2427 in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.
###2431 I think that’s a mistake. In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide
###2437 contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured. Because this is not just a — a
###2444 health issue, it’s an economic issue for women. It makes a difference. This is money
###2449 out of that family’s pocket. Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in
###2456 fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets
###2462 contraception through her insurance coverage. That’s not the kind of advocacy that women
###2467 need. When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood,
###2473 there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for,
###2479 not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.
###2484 That’s a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country. And it makes
###2490 a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work. When we talk about
###2496 child care, and the credits that we’re providing. That makes a difference in whether they can
###2501 go out there and — and earn a living for their family.
###2505 These are not just women’s issues. These are family issues. These are economic issues.
###2511 And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates
###2518 and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.
###2521 CROWLEY: Mr. President… OBAMA: And I’ve got two daughters and I
###2522 want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody’s sons have.
###2528 That’s part of what I’m fighting for as president of the United States.
###2531 CROWLEY: I want to move us along here to Susan Katz, who has a question.
###2535 And, Governor, it’s for you. QUESTION: Governor Romney, I am an undecided voter, because I’m
###2544 disappointed with the lack of progress I’ve seen in the last four years. However, I do
###2551 attribute much of America’s economic and international problems to the failings and
###2556 missteps of the Bush administration. Since both you and President Bush are Republicans,
###2564 I fear a return to the policies of those years should you win this election. What is the
###2571 biggest difference between you and George W. Bush, and how do you differentiate yourself
###2578 from George W. Bush? ROMNEY: Thank you. And I appreciate that question.
###2582 I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want
###2587 to point out that that I don’t believe… OBAMA: I don’t think so, Candy.
###2589 ROMNEY: … I don’t believe… OBAMA: I want to make sure our timekeepers
###2592 are working here. ROMNEY: The time — the time…
###2593 CROWLEY: OK. The timekeepers are all working. And let me tell you that the last part, it’s
###2598 for the two of you to talk to one another, and it isn’t quite as (inaudible) you think.
###2602 But go ahead and use this two minutes any way you’d like to, the question is on the
###2606 floor. ROMNEY: I’d just note that I don’t believe
###2608 that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives
###2612 or not. And I don’t believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive
###2615 care of not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives. And — and
###2620 the — and the president’s statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.
###2624 OBAMA: Governor… ROMNEY: Let me come back and — and answer
###2626 your question. President Bush and I are — are different
###2629 people and these are different times and that’s why my five point plan is so different than
###2634 what he would have done. I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue
###2637 of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to
###2643 go to the — the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else. That wasn’t true in his
###2646 time, that’s why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy
###2651 in North America — become energy secure. Number two, trade — I’ll crack down on
###2656 China, President Bush didn’t. I’m also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin
###2661 America. It’s been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time. I want
###2664 to add more free trade agreements so we’ll have more trade.
###2668 Number three, I’m going to get us to a balanced budget. President Bush didn’t. President
###2673 Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion
###2678 dollars under the Bush years. He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that
###2683 size for every one of his four years. And his forecast for the next four years is more
###2688 deficits, almost that large. So that’s the next area I’m different than President Bush.
###2693 And then let’s take the last one, championing small business. Our party has been focused
###2698 too long. I came through small business. I understand how hard it is to start a small
###2704 business. That’s why everything I’ll do is designed to help small businesses grow
###2709 and add jobs. I want to keep their taxes down on small business. I want regulators to see
###2715 their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.
###2720 And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it’s a long list, but one
###2724 of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses
###2728 and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.
###2733 My priority is jobs. I know how to make that happen. And President Bush has a very different
###2738 path for a very different time. My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow
###2744 and hire people. CROWLEY: Thanks, Governor.
###2748 Mr. President? OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think it’s
###2752 important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times. We were losing 800,000
###2758 jobs a month when I started. But we had been digging our way out of policies that were
###2765 misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.
###2771 Now, we’ve seen 30 consecutive — 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs
###2778 created. And the plans that I talked about will create even more. But when Governor Romney
###2785 says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan
###2790 are tax cuts. That’s what took us from surplus to deficit. When he talks about getting tough
###2797 on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of
###2804 outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries — in companies that are building
###2813 surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.
###2817 That’s — Governor, you’re the last person who’s going to get tough on China. And what
###2822 we’ve done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new
###2827 markets, but we’ve also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking
###2833 advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field. We’ve
###2836 brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration
###2843 and we’ve won every single one that’s been decided.
###2846 When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market
###2852 with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn’t be
###2857 helpful to American workers. Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs. And that’s the kind
###2862 of tough trade actions that are required. But the last point I want to make is this.
###2868 You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush. George
###2874 Bush didn’t propose turning Medicare into a voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive
###2880 immigration reform. He didn’t call for self-deportation. George Bush never suggested that we eliminate
###2888 funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George
###2895 Bush, but they’re not on economic policy. In some ways, he’s gone to a more extreme
###2901 place when it comes to social policy. And I think that’s a mistake. That’s not how
###2905 we’re going to move our economy forward. CROWLEY: I want to move you both along to
###2908 the next question, because it’s in the same wheelhouse, so you will be able to respond.
###2913 But the president does get this question. I want to call on Michael Jones.
###2919 QUESTION: Mr. President, I voted for you in 2008. What have you done or accomplished to
###2927 earn my vote in 2012? I’m not that optimistic as I was in 2012. Most things I need for everyday
###2934 living are very expensive. OBAMA: Well, we’ve gone through a tough
###2940 four years. There’s no doubt about it. But four years ago, I told the American people
###2945 and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families. And I did. I told you I’d
###2950 cut taxes for small businesses, and I have. I said that I’d end the war in Iraq, and
###2955 I did. I said we’d refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and
###2961 we have gone after Al Qaeda’s leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.
###2966 OBAMA: I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies
###2972 can’t jerk you around and if you don’t have health insurance, that you’d have a
###2975 chance to get affordable insurance, and I have.
###2978 I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest
###2983 Wall Street reforms since the 1930s. We’ve created five million jobs, and gone from 800
###2990 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress. We saved an auto industry that was
###2995 on the brink of collapse. Now, does that mean you’re not struggling?
###3001 Absolutely not. A lot of us are. And that’s why the plan that I’ve put forward for manufacturing
###3006 and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending
###3013 wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work. Making sure that we are controlling
###3020 our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future.
###3023 All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I’ve made,
###3028 I’ve kept. And those that I haven’t been able to keep,
###3032 it’s not for lack of trying and we’re going to get it done in a second term. But,
###3037 you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments
###3040 as well. And I suspect he’ll keep those too. You know when members of the Republican
###3047 Congress say, “We’re going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don’t ask a dime
###3054 for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education,
###3058 and helping kids go to college. He said, “Me too.”
###3063 When they said, “We’re going to cut Planned Parenthood funding.” He said, “Me too.”
###3068 When he said, “We’re going to repeal Obamacare. First thing I’m going to do,” despite
###3073 the fact that it’s the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is
###3076 working well. He said, “Me too.” That is not the kind of leadership that you need,
###3083 but you should expect that those are promises he’s going to keep.
###3086 (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me let…
###3087 (CROSSTALK) OBAMA: …the choice in this election is going
###3088 to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life? Make sure
###3093 your kids can go to college. Make sure that you are getting a good paying job, making
###3097 sure that Medicare and Social Security… (CROSSTALK)
###3098 CROWLEY: Mr. President. Thank you. (CROSSTALK)
###3098 OBAMA: …will be there for you. CROWLEY: Thank you. Governor?
###3104 ROMNEY: I think you know better. I think you know that these last four years haven’t
###3108 been so good as the president just described and that you don’t feel like your confident
###3113 that the next four years are going to be much better either.
###3115 I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you’re going to get.
###3119 You’re going to get a repeat of the last four years. We just can’t afford four more
###3123 years like the last four years. He said that by now we’d have unemployment
###3128 at 5.4 percent. The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans
###3135 without work. I wasn’t the one that said 5.4 percent.
###3140 This was the president’s plan. Didn’t get there.
###3143 He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security,
###3149 because he pointed out they’re on the road to bankruptcy. He would reform them. He’d
###3152 get that done. He hasn’t even made a proposal on either one.
###3157 He said in his first year he’d put out an immigration plan that would deal with our
###3161 immigration challenges. Didn’t even file it.
###3165 This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he’d do. He said that
###3169 he’d cut in half the deficit. He hasn’t done that either. In fact, he doubled it.
###3174 He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance
###3179 premiums by $2,500 a year. It’s gone up by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed,
###3187 or implemented — it’s already been passed — if it’s implemented fully, it’ll be
###3191 another $2,500 on top. ROMNEY: The middle class is getting crushed
###3195 under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy
###3200 working again. He keeps saying, “Look, I’ve created 5 million jobs.” That’s after
###3204 losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced
###3210 in this country. The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work,
###3214 is still 23 million Americans. There are more people in poverty, one out
###3218 of six people in poverty. How about food stamps? When he took office,
###3222 32 million people were on food stamps. Today, 47 million people are on food stamps. How
###3228 about the growth of the economy? It’s growing more slowly this year than last year, and
###3234 more slowly last year than the year before. The president wants to do well. I understand.
###3240 But the policies he’s put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies
###3246 to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off
###3251 and grow like it could have. You might say, “Well, you got an example
###3254 of one that worked better?” Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8
###3260 percent, between that period — the end of that recession and the equivalent of time
###3265 to today, Ronald Reagan’s recovery created twice as many jobs as this president’s recovery.
###3272 Five million jobs doesn’t even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason
###3276 the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have
###3280 dropped out of the workforce. The president has tried, but his policies
###3284 haven’t worked. He’s great as a — as a — as a speaker and describing his plans
###3291 and his vision. That’s wonderful, except we have a record to look at. And that record
###3296 shows he just hasn’t been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare
###3301 and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need. Median income
###3307 is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work. That’s what this election is
###3312 about. It’s about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous
###3317 future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.
###3322 CROWLEY: Governor, I want to move you along. Don’t — don’t go away, and we’ll have
###3325 plenty of time to respond. We are quite aware of the clock for both of you. But I want to
###3329 bring in a different subject here. Mr. President, I’ll be right back with you.
###3334 Lorraine Osorio has a question for you about a topic we have not…
###3338 OBAMA: This is for Governor Romney? CROWLEY: It’s for Governor Romney, and we’ll
###3339 be right with you, Mr. President. Thanks. ROMNEY: Is it Loraina?
###3343 QUESTION: Lorraine. ROMNEY: Lorraine?
###3344 QUESTION: Yes, Lorraine. ROMNEY: Lorraine.
###3347 QUESTION: How you doing? ROMNEY: Good, thanks.
###3350 QUESTION: Mr. Romney, what do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green
###3354 cards that are currently living here as productive members of society?
###3358 ROMNEY: Thank you. Lorraine? Did I get that right? Good. Thank you for your question.
###3364 And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly
###3368 and include an answer to your question. But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.
###3374 We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants. My dad was born in Mexico of American
###3378 parents; Ann’s dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American. We welcome
###3383 legal immigrants into this country. I want our legal system to work better. I
###3387 want it to be streamlined. I want it to be clearer. I don’t think you have to — shouldn’t
###3391 have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally. I also think
###3396 that we should give visas to people — green cards, rather, to people who graduate with
###3400 skills that we need. People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math
###3405 get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A. We should make sure
###3410 our legal system works. Number two, we’re going to have to stop
###3413 illegal immigration. There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally.
###3419 Those who’ve come here illegally take their place. So I will not grant amnesty to those
###3422 who have come here illegally. What I will do is I’ll put in place an employment
###3426 verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally
###3431 are sanctioned for doing so. I won’t put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.
###3437 So for instance, I would not give driver’s licenses to those that have come here illegally
###3441 as the president would. The kids of those that came here illegally,
###3446 those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United
###3451 States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway
###3455 to become a permanent resident. ROMNEY: Now when the president ran for office,
###3459 he said that he’d put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation — he’d file
###3463 a bill in his first year that would reform our — our immigration system, protect legal
###3468 immigration, stop illegal immigration. He didn’t do it.
###3471 He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses. Why did he
###3476 fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want
###3482 to come legally and for those that are here illegally today? What’s a question I think
###3488 the — the president will have a chance to answer right now.
###3490 OBAMA: Good, I look forward to it. Was — Lorranna — Lorraine — we are a
###3498 nation of immigrants. I mean we’re just a few miles away from Ellis Island. We all
###3503 understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to
###3510 come here. People are willing to take risks. People who want to build on their dreams and
###3516 make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.
###3519 But we’re also a nation of laws. So what I’ve said is we need to fix a broken immigration
###3526 system and I’ve done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress
###3532 to make sure that we fix the system. The first thing we did was to streamline the
###3537 legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people
###3542 who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute
###3547 to our country and that’s good for our economic growth.
###3550 They’ll start new businesses. They’ll make things happen to create jobs here in
###3555 the United States. Number two, we do have to deal with our border
###3559 so we put more border patrol on the — any time in history and the flow of undocumented
###3564 works across the border is actually lower than it’s been in 40 years.
###3569 What I’ve also said is if we’re going to go after folks who are here illegally,
###3574 we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who
###3579 are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because
###3585 they’re trying to figure out how to feed their families. And that’s what we’ve
###3588 done. And what I’ve also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times
###3594 by their parents. Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag. Think of this
###3602 as their country. Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.
###3607 And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.
###3610 And that’s what I’ve done administratively. Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he
###3616 wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, “I
###3620 will veto the DREAM Act”, that would allow these young people to have access.” His
###3627 main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, “We’re going to encourage
###3632 self-deportation.” Making life so miserable on folks that they’ll leave. He called the
###3639 Arizona law a model for the nation. Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement
###3643 officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented
###3648 workers and check their papers. You know what? If my daughter or yours looks
###3658 to somebody like they’re not a citizen, I don’t want — I don’t want to empower
###3664 somebody like that. So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way. And when Governor
###3672 Romney says, the challenge is, “Well Obama didn’t try.” That’s not true. I have
###3678 sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term. And I said, let’s
###3683 fix this system. Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.
###3688 But it’s very hard for Republican’s in Congress to support comprehensive immigration
###3693 reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I’m interested
###3699 in supporting. CROWLEY: Let me get the governor in here,
###3700 Mr. President. Let’s speak to, if you could… ROMNEY: Yes.
###3704 CROWLEY: …the idea of self-deportation? ROMNEY: No, let — let — let me go back
###3707 and speak to the points that the president made and — and — and let’s get them
###3711 correct. I did not say that the Arizona law was a model
###3714 for the nation in that aspect. I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which
###3720 is — which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine
###3724 whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation. That’s
###3728 number one. Number two, I asked the president a question
###3731 I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked. He was asked this on
###3735 Univision the other day. Why, when you said you’d filed legislation in your first year
###3740 didn’t you do it? And he didn’t answer. He — he doesn’t answer that question.
###3744 He said the standard bearer wasn’t for it. I’m glad you thought I was a standard bearer
###3747 four years ago, but I wasn’t. Four years ago you said in your first year
###3753 you would file legislation. In his first year, I was just getting — licking
###3757 my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right. I was not the standard
###3761 bearer. My — my view is that this president should
###3764 have honored his promise to do as he said. Now, let me mention one other thing, and that
###3768 is self-deportation says let people make their own choice. What I was saying is, we’re
###3773 not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation.
###3779 Instead let people make their own choice. And if they — if they find that — that
###3783 they can’t get the benefits here that they want and they can’t — and they can’t
###3786 find the job they want, then they’ll make a decision to go a place where — where they
###3789 have better opportunities. But I’m not in favor of rounding up people
###3792 and — and — and taking them out of this country. I am in favor, as the president has
###3797 said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to
###3801 get them out of this country. ROMNEY: Let me mention something else the
###3803 president said. It was a moment ago and I didn’t get a chance to, when he was describing
###3807 Chinese investments and so forth. OBAMA: Candy?
###3811 Hold on a second. The… ROMNEY: Mr. President, I’m still speaking.
###3816 (CROSSTALK) ROMNEY: Mr. President, let me finish.
###3818 (CROSSTALK) ROMNEY: I’ve gotta continue.
###3819 (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: Governor Romney, you can make it
###3823 short. See all these people? They’ve been waiting for you. (inaudible) make it short
###3825 (inaudible). ROMNEY: Just going to make a point. Any investments
###3827 I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust. And I understand
###3831 they do include investments outside the United States, including in — in Chinese companies.
###3836 Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? Have you looked at your pension?
###3839 OBAMA: I’ve got to say… ROMNEY: Mr. President, have you looked at
###3842 your pension? OBAMA: You know, I — I don’t look at my
###3844 pension. It’s not as big as yours so it doesn’t take as long.
###3846 ROMNEY: Well, let me give you some advice. OBAMA: I don’t check it that often.
###3849 ROMNEY: Let me give you some advice. Look at your pension. You also have investments
###3852 in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments
###3857 through a Cayman’s trust. (CROSSTALK)
###3858 CROWLEY: We’re way off topic here, Governor Romney.
###3860 (CROSSTALK) OBAMA: I thought we were talking about immigration.
###3864 (CROSSTALK) OBAMA: I do want to make sure that…
###3867 CROWLEY: If I could have you sit down, Governor Romney. Thank you.
###3869 OBAMA: I do want to make sure that — I do want to make sure that we just understand
###3871 something. Governor Romney says he wasn’t referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.
###3876 His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety
###3881 of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing. That’s his policy. And it’s a bad policy. And it
###3887 won’t help us grow. Look, when we think about immigration, we
###3894 have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land
###3900 of promise. And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start
###3906 companies like Intel and Google. And we want to encourage that.
###3910 Now, we’ve got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and
###3915 we make the legal system better. But when we make this into a divisive political issue,
###3923 and when we don’t have bipartisan support — I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch
###3927 of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can’t…
###3929 ROMNEY: I’ll get it done. I’ll get it done. First year…
###3932 OBAMA: … we can’t — we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all.
###3937 And it’s time for them to get serious on it.
###3938 CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me move you on here please. Mr. President, (inaudible).
###3938 OBAMA: This used to be a bipartisan issue. (CROSSTALK)
###3939 CROWLEY: Don’t go away, though — right. Don’t go away because I — I want you to
###3942 talk to Kerry Ladka who wants to switch the topic for us.
###3946 OBAMA: OK. Hi, Kerry.
###3947 QUESTION: Good evening, Mr. President. OBAMA: I’m sorry. What’s your name?
###3952 QUESTION: It’s Kerry, Kerry Ladka. OBAMA: Great to see you.
###3956 QUESTION: This question actually comes from a brain trust of my friends at Global Telecom
###3962 Supply (ph) in Minneola yesterday. OBAMA: Ah.
###3964 QUESTION: We were sitting around, talking about Libya, and we were reading and became
###3968 aware of reports that the State Department refused extra security for our embassy in
###3974 Benghazi, Libya, prior to the attacks that killed four Americans.
###3980 Who was it that denied enhanced security and why?
###3984 OBAMA: Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around
###3990 the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation. And these aren’t just
###3996 representatives of the United States, they are my representatives. I send them there,
###4001 oftentimes into harm’s way. I know these folks and I know their families. So nobody
###4007 is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.
###4010 So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the
###4016 phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions.
###4019 Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and
###4027 consulate in the region. Number two, investigate exactly what happened,
###4033 regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it
###4038 doesn’t happen again. And number three, we are going to find out
###4043 who did this and we’re going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I’ve
###4046 said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.
###4052 OBAMA: Now Governor Romney had a very different response. While we were still dealing with
###4058 our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political
###4066 points, and that’s not how a commander in chief operates. You don’t turn national
###4073 security into a political issue. Certainly not right when it’s happening. And people
###4080 — not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I’ve made. But when it comes to
###4083 our national security, I mean what I say. I said I’d end the war in Libya — in — in
###4089 Iraq, and I did. I said that we’d go after al-Qaeda and bin
###4094 Laden, we have. I said we’d transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that
###4100 Afghans are responsible for their own security, that’s what I’m doing. And when it comes
###4105 to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody
###4110 will be held accountable. And I am ultimately responsible for what’s taking place there
###4116 because these are my folks, and I’m the one who has to greet those coffins when they
###4121 come home. You know that I mean what I say. CROWLEY: Mr. President, I’m going to move
###4126 us along. Governor? ROMNEY: Thank you Kerry for your question,
###4130 it’s an important one. And — and I — I think the president just said correctly that
###4135 the buck does stop at his desk and — and he takes responsibility for — for that — for
###4141 the failure in providing those security resources, and — and those terrible things may well
###4146 happen from time to time. I — I’m — I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families
###4150 of those who lost loved ones. And today there’s a memorial service for one of those that was
###4154 lost in this tragedy. We — we think of their families and care for them deeply. There were
###4159 other issues associated with this — with this tragedy. There were many days that passed
###4166 before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was
###4170 a terrorist attack. ROMNEY: And there was no demonstration involved.
###4172 It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.
###4179 Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn’t know what happened,
###4183 you have to ask yourself why didn’t we know five days later when the ambassador to the
###4188 United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration. How could we have not
###4192 known? But I find more troubling than this, that
###4195 on — on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first
###4199 time that’s happened since 1979, when — when we have four Americans killed there, when
###4206 apparently we didn’t know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened,
###4211 flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another
###4215 event, other political event. I think these — these actions taken by a
###4220 president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in
###4226 that you’d hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually
###4230 eyewitnesses. We’ve read their accounts now about what happened. It was very clear
###4234 this was not a demonstration. This was an attack by terrorists.
###4238 And this calls into question the president’s whole policy in the Middle East. Look what’s
###4242 happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya. Consider the distance between ourselves and
###4249 — and Israel, the president said that — that he was going to put daylight between us and
###4253 Israel. We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear
###4256 bomb. Syria — Syria’s not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military,
###4263 but also a strategic — strategically significant player for America.
###4267 The president’s policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and
###4272 — and — and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling
###4276 before our very eyes. CROWLEY: Because we’re — we’re closing
###4281 in, I want to still get a lot of people in. I want to ask you something, Mr. President,
###4284 and then have the governor just quickly. Your secretary of state, as I’m sure you
###4288 know, has said that she takes full responsibility for the attack on the diplomatic mission in
###4294 Benghazi. Does the buck stop with your secretary of state as far as what went on here?
###4298 OBAMA: Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job. But she works for me. I’m the president
###4304 and I’m always responsible, and that’s why nobody’s more interested in finding
###4309 out exactly what happened than I do. The day after the attack, governor, I stood
###4317 in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find
###4322 out exactly what happened. That this was an act of terror and I also said that we’re
###4329 going to hunt down those who committed this crime.
###4333 And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force
###4338 Base and grieving with the families. And the suggestion that anybody in my team,
###4347 whether the Secretary of State, our U.N. Ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or
###4356 mislead when we’ve lost four of our own, governor, is offensive. That’s not what
###4362 we do. That’s not what I do as president, that’s not what I do as Commander in Chief.
###4369 CROWLEY: Governor, if you want to… ROMNEY: Yes, I — I…
###4373 CROWLEY: … quickly to this please. ROMNEY: I — I think interesting the president
###4376 just said something which — which is that on the day after the attack he went into the
###4379 Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.
###4382 OBAMA: That’s what I said. ROMNEY: You said in the Rose Garden the day
###4386 after the attack, it was an act of terror. It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is
###4393 that what you’re saying? OBAMA: Please proceed governor.
###4395 ROMNEY: I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14
###4400 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.
###4403 OBAMA: Get the transcript. CROWLEY: It — it — it — he did in fact,
###4405 sir. So let me — let me call it an act of terror…
###4407 OBAMA: Can you say that a little louder, Candy? CROWLEY: He — he did call it an act of terror.
###4412 It did as well take — it did as well take two weeks or so for the whole idea there being
###4420 a riot out there about this tape to come out. You are correct about that.
###4424 ROMNEY: This — the administration — the administration indicated this was a reaction
###4429 to a video and was a spontaneous reaction. CROWLEY: It did.
###4432 ROMNEY: It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.
###4437 And to suggest — am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the — your secretary
###4444 – OBAMA: Candy?
###4444 ROMNEY: Excuse me. The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows
###4449 and spoke about how – OBAMA: Candy, I’m –
###4450 ROMNEY: — this was a spontaneous – CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me –
###4451 OBAMA: I’m happy to have a longer conversation –
###4453 CROWLEY: I know you – OBAMA: — about foreign policy.
###4454 CROWLEY: Absolutely. But I want to — I want to move you on and also –
###4456 OBAMA: OK. I’m happy to do that, too. CROWLEY: — the transcripts and –
###4458 OBAMA: I just want to make sure that – CROWLEY: — figure out what we –
###4461 OBAMA: — all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their
###4463 questions answered. CROWLEY: Because what I — what I want to
###4465 do, Mr. President, stand there a second, because I want to introduce you to Nina Gonzalez,
###4469 who brought up a question that we hear a lot, both over the Internet and from this crowd.
###4476 QUESTION: President Obama, during the Democratic National Convention in 2008, you stated you
###4483 wanted to keep AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. What has your administration done
###4490 or planned to do to limit the availability of assault weapons?
###4495 OBAMA: We’re a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second
###4500 Amendment. We’ve got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want
###4507 to make sure they can protect themselves. But there have been too many instances during
###4513 the course of my presidency, where I’ve had to comfort families who have lost somebody.
###4519 Most recently out in Aurora. You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably
###4525 about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot
###4534 in that theater. And her son had been shot through the head.
###4540 And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this
###4548 young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.
###4556 But there were a lot of families who didn’t have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters
###4562 or husbands didn’t survive. So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce
###4568 the laws we’ve already got, make sure that we’re keeping guns out of the hands of criminals,
###4573 those who are mentally ill. We’ve done a much better job in terms of background checks,
###4579 but we’ve got more to do when it comes to enforcement.
###4582 But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters
###4589 don’t belong on our streets. And so what I’m trying to do is to get a broader conversation
###4595 about how do we reduce the violence generally. Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault
###4604 weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.
###4610 Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there’s an awful lot of violence and they’re
###4612 not using AK-47s. They’re using cheap hand guns.
###4616 And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that
###4621 our schools are working; that if there’s violence on the streets, that working with
###4627 faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.
###4631 And so what I want is a — is a comprehensive strategy. Part of it is seeing if we can get
###4638 automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and
###4645 the mentally ill. But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these
###4649 communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.
###4654 CROWLEY: Governor Romney, the question is about assault weapons, AK-47s.
###4657 ROMNEY: Yeah, I’m not in favor of new pieces of legislation on — on guns and taking guns
###4663 away or making certain guns illegal. We, of course, don’t want to have automatic weapons,
###4667 and that’s already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons. What I believe
###4672 is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which
###4675 is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture
###4682 of violence that we have. And you ask how — how are we going to do
###4684 that? And there are a number of things. He mentioned good schools. I totally agree. We
###4688 were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state. And I believe
###4693 if we do a better job in education, we’ll — we’ll give people the — the hope and
###4696 opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that. But let me mention another
###4700 thing. And that is parents. We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids. Wherever possible
###4706 the — the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that’s not always possible.
###4709 A lot of great single moms, single dads. But gosh to tell our kids that before they have
###4714 babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that’s a great idea.
###4719 Because if there’s a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down
###4723 dramatically. The opportunities that the child will — will be able to achieve increase
###4728 dramatically. So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people
###4733 away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system. The
###4738 — the greatest failure we’ve had with regards to — to gun violence in some respects
###4741 is what — what is known as Fast and Furious. Which was a program under this administration,
###4748 and how it worked exactly I think we don’t know precisely, where thousands of automatic,
###4754 and AK-47 type weapons were — were given to people that ultimately gave them to — to
###4759 drug lords. They used those weapons against — against
###4763 their own citizens and killed Americans with them. And this was a — this was a program
###4767 of the government. For what purpose it was put in place, I can’t imagine. But it’s
###4772 one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this
###4776 administration. Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it’s
###4781 been investigated to a degree, but — but the administration has carried out executive
###4787 privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.
###4790 I’d like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it
###4794 led to the violence, thousands of guns going to Mexican drug lords. OBAMA: Candy?
###4799 CROWLEY: Governor, Governor, if I could, the question was about these assault weapons that
###4803 once were once banned and are no longer banned. I know that you signed an assault weapons
###4810 ban when you were in Massachusetts, obviously, with this question, you no longer do support
###4814 that. Why is that, given the kind of violence that we see sometimes with these mass killings?
###4820 Why is it that you have changed your mind? ROMNEY: Well, Candy, actually, in my state,
###4825 the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation.
###4831 And it’s referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill,
###4836 both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities
###4840 for both that both wanted. There were hunting opportunities, for instance,
###4844 that haven’t previously been available and so forth, so it was a mutually agreed- upon
###4847 piece of legislation. That’s what we need more of, Candy. What we have right now in
###4852 Washington is a place that’s gridlocked. CROWLEY: So I could — if you could get people
###4856 to agree to it, you would be for it? ROMNEY: We have –
###4858 OBAMA: Candy? ROMNEY: — we haven’t had the leadership
###4860 in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis. I was able to do that in my state and bring
###4864 these two together. CROWLEY: Quickly, Mr. President.
###4866 OBAMA: The — first of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before
###4873 he was against it. And he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because
###4880 he was seeking the endorsement of the National Rifle Association. So that’s on the record.
###4887 But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of
###4892 schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are
###4898 less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts. We’re not going to eliminate everybody
###4902 who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don’t get weapons.
###4905 (AUDIO GAP) OBAMA: because I do believe that if our young
###4906 people have opportunity, then they’re less likely to engage in these kind of violent
###4906 acts. We’re not going to eliminate everybody who
###4906 is mentally disturbed, and we’ve got to make sure they don’t get weapons. But we
###4907 can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless
###4912 of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed.
###4915 And, Candy, we haven’t had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very
###4920 important to understand that the reforms we’ve put in place, working with 46 governors around
###4926 the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids
###4933 starting to succeed. We’re starting to see gains in math and science.
###4937 When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau
###4944 Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school
###4948 but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now.
###4954 And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers. And so we’re matching them up.
###4960 Giving them access to higher education. As I said, we have made sure that millions of
###4965 young people are able to get an education that they weren’t able to get before.
###4968 Now… CROWLEY: Mr. President, I have to — I have
###4970 to move you along here. You said you wanted to…
###4972 (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: We need to do it here.
###4973 OBAMA: But — but it’ll — it’ll — it’ll be…
###4974 (CROSSTALK) OBAMA: … just one second.
###4975 CROWLEY: One… OBAMA: Because — because this is important.
###4977 This is part of the choice in this election. When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers,
###4984 hiring more teachers was important to growing our economy, Governor Romney said that doesn’t
###4989 grow our economy. When — when he was asked would class size…
###4992 (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: The question, Mr. President, was
###4994 guns here, so I need to move us along. OBAMA: I understand.
###4996 CROWLEY: You know, the question was guns. So let me — let me bring in another…
###4997 OBAMA: But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy
###5001 forward for these young people… CROWLEY: I understand.
###5002 OBAMA: … and reduce our violence. CROWLEY: OK. Thank you so much.
###5005 I want to ask Carol Goldberg to stand up, because she gets to a question that both these
###5009 men have been passionate about. It’s for Governor Romney.
###5012 QUESTION: The outsourcing of American jobs overseas has taken a toll on our economy.
###5019 What plans do you have to put back and keep jobs here in the United States?
###5023 ROMNEY: Boy, great question and important question, because you’re absolutely right.
###5028 The place where we’ve seen manufacturing go has been China. China is now the largest
###5032 manufacturer in the world. It used to be the United States of America. A lot of good people
###5036 have lost jobs. A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.
###5041 That’s total over the last four years. One of the reasons for that is that people
###5045 think it’s more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here. We have
###5049 made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to
###5054 time. What I will do as president is make sure it’s more attractive to come to America
###5058 again. This is the way we’re going to create jobs
###5061 in this country. It’s not by trickle-down government, saying we’re going to take more
###5065 money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more
###5071 regulations. Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere.
###5075 I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for
###5080 small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America.
###5085 Now, we’re going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play
###5089 by the rules. And China hasn’t. One of the reasons — or one of the ways they don’t
###5094 play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency. Because
###5098 if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low.
###5103 And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace. We lose sales. And manufacturers here in the
###5108 U.S. making the same products can’t compete. China has been a currency manipulator for
###5113 years and years and years. And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as
###5120 a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so.
###5122 On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president
###5129 to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking
###5134 unfair advantage of our manufacturers. So we’re going to make sure that people
###5138 we trade with around the world play by the rules. But let me — let me not just stop
###5143 there. Don’t forget, what’s key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone
###5149 else to punish, and I’m going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure
###5153 they — they follow the law and play by the rules, but it’s also to make America the
###5157 most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds.
###5161 That’s why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they
###5166 want to be here. Canada’s tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So
###5173 if you’re starting a business, where would you rather start it? We have to be competitive
###5178 if we’re going to create more jobs here. Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations
###5183 quadrupled under this president. I talk to small businesses across the country. They
###5188 say, “We feel like we’re under attack from our own government.” I want to make
###5192 sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it. And there’s
###5197 no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of
###5203 all kinds hiring people. My priority is making sure that we get more
###5207 people hired. If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get
###5213 back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you’re going to see rising incomes
###5218 again. The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high. I know what it takes
###5223 to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that
###5227 we keep China playing by the rules. CROWLEY: Mr. President, two minutes here,
###5232 because we are then going to go to our last question.
###5236 OBAMA: OK. We need to create jobs here. And both Governor Romney and I agree actually
###5241 that we should lower our corporate tax rate. It’s too high. But there’s a difference
###5245 in terms of how we would do it. I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct
###5252 expenses when they move to China; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get
###5260 taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore. All those changes in our tax code would make
###5266 a difference. Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand
###5270 those tax breaks. One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be
###5275 to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don’t have to pay U.S. taxes.
###5282 But, of course, if you’re a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business
###5286 starting up here, you’ve got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney’s
###5290 talking about. And it’s estimated that that will create
###5293 800,000 new jobs. The problem is they’ll be in china. Or India. Or Germany.
###5301 That’s not the way we’re going to create jobs here. The way we’re going to create
###5304 jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports. And we are
###5310 on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president. That’s
###5314 creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country. That’s why we’ve kept on
###5320 pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American
###5324 businesses are getting a good deal. Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as
###5329 I already indicated. In the private sector, Governor Romney’s company invested in what
###5335 were called pioneers of outsourcing. That’s not my phrase. That’s what reporters called
###5341 it. And as far as currency manipulation, the currency
###5346 has actually gone up 11 percent since I’ve been president because we have pushed them
###5350 hard. And we’ve put unprecedented trade pressure on China. That’s why exports have
###5357 significantly increased under my presidency. That’s going to help to create jobs here.
###5361 CROWLEY: Mr. President, we have a really short time for a quick discussion here.
###5366 iPad, the Macs, the iPhones, they are all manufactured in China. One of the major reasons
###5373 is labor is so much cheaper here. How do you convince a great American company to bring
###5378 that manufacturing back here? ROMNEY: The answer is very straightforward.
###5385 We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level. China’s
###5389 been cheating over the years. One by holding down the value of their currency. Number two,
###5394 by stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology. There’s
###5398 even an Apple store in China that’s a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods. They
###5403 hack into our computers. We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that’s number
###5407 one. Number two, we have to make America the most
###5411 attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand their business. That’s
###5415 what brings jobs in. The president’s characterization of my tax plan…
###5419 (CROSSTALK) ROMNEY: …is completely…is completely…
###5421 (CROSSTALK) ROMNEY: …is completely false. Let me tell
###5422 you… CROWLEY: Let me to go the president here because
###5424 we really are running out of time. And the question is can we ever get — we can’t
###5428 get wages like that. It can’t be sustained. OBAMA: Candy, there are some jobs that are
###5431 not going to come back. Because they are low wage, low skill jobs. I want high wage, high
###5438 skill jobs. That’s why we have to emphasize manufacturing. That’s why we have to invest
###5443 in advanced manufacturing. That’s why we’ve got to make sure that we’ve got the best
###5447 science and research in the world. And when we talk about deficits, if we’re adding
###5452 to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don’t need them, and we’re cutting investments
###5458 in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation
###5464 that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race.
###5467 If we’re not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.
###5473 Then companies won’t come here. Those investments are what’s going to help to make sure that
###5478 we continue to lead this world economy, not just next year, but 10 years from now, 50
###5484 years from now, 100 years from now. CROWLEY: Thanks Mr. President.
###5485 (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: Governor Romney?
###5486 ROMNEY: Government does not create jobs. Government does not create jobs.
###5488 CROWLEY: Governor Romney, I want to introduce you to Barry Green, because he’s going to
###5491 have the last question to you first? ROMNEY: Barry? Where is Barry?
###5498 QUESTION: Hi, Governor. I think this is a tough question. To each of you. What do you
###5504 believe is the biggest misperception that the American people have about you as a man
###5510 and a candidate? Using specific examples, can you take this opportunity to debunk that
###5516 misperception and set us straight? ROMNEY: Thank you, and that’s an opportunity
###5522 for me, and I appreciate it. In the nature of a campaign, it seems that
###5528 some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future
###5532 and the things they’d like to do. In the course of that, I think the president’s
###5536 campaign has tried to characterize me as — as someone who’s very different than who I
###5540 am. I care about 100 percent of the American people.
###5544 I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future. I
###5547 care about our kids. I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future
###5553 for America again. I spent my life in the private sector, not in government. I’m a
###5558 guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people.
###5562 My — my passion probably flows from the fact that I believe in God. And I believe
###5568 we’re all children of the same God. I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another.
###5573 I — I served as a missionary for my church. I served as a pastor in my congregation for
###5578 about 10 years. I’ve sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked
###5583 with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times.
###5587 I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track. And as governor
###5591 of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98
###5597 percent of the adults. I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation,
###5602 so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future.
###5605 ROMNEY: I understand that I can get this country on track again. We don’t have to settle
###5610 for what we’re going through. We don’t have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.
###5614 We don’t have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level. We don’t have
###5619 to settle for 47 million people on food stamps. We don’t have to settle for 50 percent of
###5624 kids coming out of college not able to get work. We don’t have to settle for 23 million
###5629 people struggling to find a good job. If I become president, I’ll get America
###5634 working again. I will get us on track to a balanced budget. The president hasn’t. I
###5638 will. I’ll make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming
###5644 — coming generations. The president said he would. He didn’t.
###5646 CROWLEY: Governor… ROMNEY: I’ll get our incomes up. And by
###5649 the way, I’ve done these things. I served as governor and showed I could get them done.
###5653 CROWLEY: Mr. President, last two minutes belong to you.
###5656 OBAMA: Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last four years, has been devoted
###5664 to this nation that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer.
###5669 That’s not what I believe. I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest
###5674 engine of prosperity the world’s ever known. I believe in self-reliance and individual
###5681 initiative and risk takers being rewarded. But I also believe that everybody should have
###5687 a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the
###5692 same rules, because that’s how our economy’s grown. That’s how we built the world’s
###5698 greatest middle class. And — and that is part of what’s at stake
###5703 in this election. There’s a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country
###5707 forward. I believe Governor Romney is a good man. Loves
###5713 his family, cares about his faith. But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors
###5720 that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility,
###5730 think about who he was talking about. Folks on Social Security who’ve worked all
###5734 their lives. Veterans who’ve sacrificed for this country. Students who are out there
###5742 trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country’s dreams. Soldiers
###5748 who are overseas fighting for us right now. People who are working hard every day, paying
###5754 payroll tax, gas taxes, but don’t make enough income.
###5759 And I want to fight for them. That’s what I’ve been doing for the last four years.
###5762 Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds.
###5767 When my grandfather fought in World War II and he came back and he got a G.I. Bill and
###5772 that allowed him to go to college, that wasn’t a handout. That was something that advanced
###5777 the entire country. And I want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities.
###5782 That’s why I’m asking for your vote and that’s why I’m asking for another four
###5785 years. CROWLEY: President Obama, Governor Romney,
###5788 thank you for being here tonight. On that note we have come to an end of this
###5791 town hall debate. Our thanks to the participants for their time and to the people of Hofstra
###5796 University for their hospitality. The next and final debate takes place Monday
###5802 night at Lynn (ph) University in Boca Raton, Florida. Don’t forget to watch. Election
###5806 Day is three weeks from today. Don’t forget to vote.
###5809 Good night. (APPLAUSE)
###5809 END
