###1 MICHAEL WHITE: Did I hear you wanted to do
###3 something with octopus?
###3 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###5 MICHAEL WHITE: We'll make a little ragu.
###7 It smells just like the sea.
###9 But this is the whole edible part of the octopi.
###11 We can use all of this.
###14 We'll break it for a bit and then we'll grill it.
###16 
###20 When we're doing the octopus with bone marrow, instead of
###22 putting olive oil in, we put the piped bone marrow.
###24 This is what we put inside the fusilli with bone marrow when
###27 we toss it with tomato sauce, and the braising liquid of
###31 octopus and red wine, until that unctuous, really
###33 delicate, rich flavor comes out.
###37 This dish is like, you know Jimmy Buffett has to sing
###40 "Cheeseburger in Paradise" at every concert?
###43 This is the equivalent.
###44 But that's a good thing to have.
###47 People use the word "chef" very, very lightly.
###50 When people come up to me and say, you know my husband he's
###52 a great chef.
###53 I say, really?
###54 I said, where does he work?
###55 No, no, no, he's in finance, but he's a great chef.
###58 So he's probably a great home cook and I'd love to go eat
###64 dinner with him, but he's not a chef.
###65 I'll let you know what a chef is.
###67 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
###72 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###78 MICHAEL WHITE: My name is Chef Michael White, and I'm the
###79 chef-owner of Marea in Columbus Circle
###81 here in New York City.
###83 
###88 Marea is known for Italian cooking.
###91 Marea had become synonymous for a couple of dishes.
###95 Whether it's a sea urchin crostini with lardo, actually
###101 the grilled octopus with the salsa tonnata.
###104 Italy is surrounded by the Mediterranean and the Adriatic
###107 Sea and the Ionian Sea, so we do lots of fish here.
###111 It also has quite a few pastas.
###114 Italian restaurants are judged upon pastas.
###117 You could cook the greatest veal chop in the world, but
###119 people come here for pasta.
###120 I got interested in Italian cooking because Italian food
###123 in the Midwest, where I grew up, was the
###126 ethnic food of choice.
###127 It was usually going to Domenico's, which was a local
###131 Italian restaurant in the city, Beloit, Wisconsin.
###133 So that's kind of how I caught the bug.
###135 And I had a football injury.
###137 In rehab I was watching a bit of TV and "Great Chefs" was on
###141 the Discovery Channel back in the day, those first shows.
###144 And I knew that was what I wanted to do.
###149 The camaraderie in working with all the people in the
###152 kitchen, it really drives you every day.
###153 It's a ginormous team that's always working together.
###158 There's 138 people that work at Marea.
###161 We have wonderful line cooks, garde manger people.
###165 It's really all those people working together that watch
###170 this organized chaos come to the pass every night.
###173 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###175 MICHAEL WHITE: We probably, at Marea, turn away probably 300
###178 people per day.
###180 We're very fortunate to be a popular restaurant here.
###182 I'm dealing with very, very high end people that make the
###186 world go round, whether it's dignitaries,
###188 whether it's the Clintons.
###190 At the same time, I get young people that are in the
###193 restaurant business.
###194 That's one of the great parts about being a chef is that you
###198 get to see these people and they're eating your food.
###201 JOSH OZERSKY: This rigatoni is incredible.
###203 I think it's one of your best.
###204 MICHAEL WHITE: Meeting Josh--
###205 Josh is a blogger--
###206 Josh is like my brother, we were separated at birth.
###211 JOSH OZERSKY: You know what I would like?
###211 I'll tell you what I would like.
###212 I would like a little bit of grappa.
###214 JOSH CAPON: Yeah?
###215 JOSH OZERSKY: Yeah.
###216 JOSH CAPON: Is it that grappa's a digestive?
###217 Isn't that something you finish your meal with?
###220 MICHAEL WHITE: I met Josh Capon because he has a
###222 fantastic restaurant called Burger & Barrel.
###225 We all used to dine once or twice a week.
###229 It's one of the highlights of it.
###231 We'll all at least get out to go have a drink
###233 and shoot the shit.
###234 All right, let's go.
###236 OLIVIA YOUNG: What is that?
###237 JOSH OZERSKY: What?
###238 MICHAEL WHITE: Shit on your back.
###238 A bird shit on your back.
###240 JOSH OZERSKY: When?
###240 Just now?
###241 JOSH CAPON: Yeah.
###242 JOSH OZERSKY: Shut up.
###242 JOSH CAPON: I think the bird shit on you before
###245 you got in the car.
###246 I think that if I got my $232 million I would get a neck
###251 transplant.
###253 I would get neck liposuction.
###257 So where are we going may I ask?
###258 MICHAEL WHITE: This is called SriPraPhai.
###259 You know, all you New Yorkers haven't been there.
###263 JOSH OZERSKY: Are you fucking kidding me?
###264 MICHAEL WHITE: Have you been to SriPraPhai?
###264 JOSH OZERSKY: Do you know who I am?
###266 SriPraPhai was the seminal Thai restaurant in New York
###272 that made the city's gastronomes and food writers
###275 aware of the possibilities of Thai food.
###279 MICHAEL WHITE: I am a fanatic about Asian food.
###282 Last night when we were going to Queens, I think I made
###285 mention in the car, that in that area, whether it's
###289 Indian, Sri Lankan, Thai--
###292 there's so many great places to eat.
###295 Queens is a melting pot--
###297 it's a fucking fool's paradise of food.
###301 Love this place.
###303 [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING]
###314 MICHAEL WHITE: When people ask me where I like to eat, that's
###317 what I like to eat.
###319 There are fantastic restaurants here in New York
###321 City, but when you go there, it's a whole different story.
###324 
###327 I mean, it's pretty fucking amazing.
###329 I mean you close your eyes, all of a sudden you think
###331 you're like [ASIAN RIFF]
###333 I should be there, that's how good it is.
###336 Okay, so this is what you do-- we build it now.
###338 OK?
###339 We had the crispy watercress salad with pulled chicken,
###344 calamari, chilies, and then they ask you how
###346 hot do you want it?
###348 JOSH CAPON: I'm going to need a pitcher
###350 of ice water, please.
###350 WAITRESS: OK, sure.
###351 [LAUGHTER]
###352 OLIVIA YOUNG: And some beer.
###353 We need the beer.
###354 JOSH CAPON: I'm going to be all over you.
###355 MICHAEL WHITE: Capon started just pounding the water-- that
###356 really just makes it worse because all the oils that are
###359 coming from the chilies and then you're drinking water?
###361 You're just dispersing it all over your whole mouth.
###364 JOSH CAPON: Woo!
###365 I'm starting to sweat.
###368 MICHAEL WHITE: Is this not off the hook?
###369 Right?
###370 JOSH CAPON: Good times.
###372 JOSH OZERSKY: You know, this to me, is literally what
###373 food's all about.
###374 [INAUDIBLE].
###375 MICHAEL WHITE: I just wanted you to taste, I
###376 mean this is like--
###378 look at the thickness on these satays.
###379 These satays are no joke.
###381 JOSH OZERSKY: What meat is that?
###381 JOSH CAPON: Pork.
###382 JOSH OZERSKY: It's unreal.
###383 OLIVIA YOUNG: Oh my god, the peanut sauce is so good.
###387 JOSH OZERSKY: Oh my god.
###389 Holy shit.
###390 MICHAEL WHITE: Chefs, I like to think that
###391 we have palate fatigue.
###392 I don't know if I demonstrated that last night.
###394 But palate fatigue, it's kind of like writer's block,
###397 though, I would say like in the same thing.
###398 You think about what you're going to eat
###400 before you taste it.
###403 I'm at my point right now where I really like impact
###406 flavor whether it's soy, wasabi, the lemongrass and the
###410 chili, and the different flavors.
###412 The salty, sweet, fish sauce, sugar.
###416 It's amazing.
###416 And I passed it last night.
###417 It's like welcome to flavor country,
###419 here it is on a plate.
###420 It's no bullshit.
###421 JOSH CAPON: Did you want to try some of the Pad Thai?
###422 MICHAEL WHITE: Yes, I do.
###422 This is phenomenal Pad Thai.
###424 Look at how it's glazed.
###425 I mean, I'm a pasta guy, I know, but--
###429 but look at how it's just perfect.
###432 JOSH OZERSKY: It's amazing.
###433 It's the sweetness and the heat [INAUDIBLE].
###437 And [INAUDIBLE].
###438 Everything's at 11.
###439 This kind of food has so much soul.
###443 Every bite pops.
###445 It pops like Michael's--
###447 when you eat Michael's food.
###448 Every bite pops.
###449 OLIVIA YOUNG: Right.
###450 JOSH OZERSKY: You know what I mean?
###451 OLIVIA YOUNG: Yeah.
###452 JOSH OZERSKY: It's so in harmony.
###454 It's a high wire act.
###455 If you go a little bit too much in one
###457 direction, it's ludicrous.
###460 MICHAEL WHITE: We were on our 12th dish at SriPraPhai, and
###463 there was some pre-talk about eating some lamb kebabs.
###466 I'm really glad we went to the pudding place.
###468 
###472 JOSH OZERSKY: I can't eat hot food in the outdoors.
###474 JOSH CAPON: I am praying to God I'll be able to make it to
###476 the pudding place.
###478 MICHAEL WHITE: What's the worst that can happen?
###479 You're just going to pass out.
###481 Wake you up.
###481 OLIVIA YOUNG: Have an accident.
###482 JOSH CAPON: I might have an accident.
###484 MICHAEL WHITE: OK, listen.
###484 Let's talk about pudding because
###485 pudding is our next stop.
###487 JOSH CAPON: Have you been there?
###488 JOSH OZERSKY: No, I fucking read about it in a book once.
###490 No of course, it's a block from my house.
###492 JOSH CAPON: So the question is--
###492 JOSH OZERSKY: Do you know who I am?
###495 MICHAEL WHITE: Hey this is a serious decision.
###496 JOSH OZERSKY: Don't take this lightly.
###498 JOSH CAPON: A regular chocolate, a regular vanilla,
###501 a regular banana, a regular butterscotch--
###504 JOSH OZERSKY: And how about a small lemon?
###505 JOSH CAPON: A small lemon.
###507 OLIVIA YOUNG: And can we get salted caramel
###508 sauce on the side?
###509 JOSH OZERSKY: Why don't you get chicken one of those?
###509 MICHAEL WHITE: Aaahhh!
###510 JOSH CAPON: Oh, I'm sorry.
###511 Wait a minute.
###513 Let's change the banana coconut--
###515 MICHAEL WHITE: Listen, Josh was fucking crazy last night.
###518 Josh went crazy in there, seeing as
###520 though he has no neck.
###521 I mean, like now we know why.
###523 JOSH CAPON: It's not pie.
###524 OLIVIA YOUNG: What?
###525 JOSH OZERSKY: Are you out of your mind?
###526 Are you on peyote or something?
###528 [LAUGHTER]
###530 MICHAEL WHITE: Time out!
###532 Out of control.
###533 Out of control!
###533 JOSH OZERSKY: He's lost it.
###535 Someone's gonna pull your card, my friend.
###539 Someone's gonna pull your card.
###542 MICHAEL WHITE: The pudding that we had was
###543 off the hook, though.
###543 You know how when your mom used to make pudding and that
###546 scum went across the top and you knew that
###549 it was cooked pudding?
###551 JOSH OZERSKY: That's really good.
###553 That's fantastic.
###556 MICHAEL WHITE: Which one is this?
###558 This looks like tiramisu.
###561 The chocolate was great the way it was, but then when you
###564 put that little bit of whipped cream on the top, and they
###567 happen to be using Battenkill Farms milk
###571 from Salem, New York.
###573 JOSH OZERSKY: You're not going to believe this shit.
###574 You know why it's so good?
###575 MICHAEL WHITE: Why?
###576 JOSH OZERSKY: You know what the milk they use?
###578 From "Bambi".
###578 MICHAEL WHITE: Yes!
###578 I knew it!
###579 JOSH OZERSKY: From Battenkill, Battenkill.
###581 MICHAEL WHITE: Is this Battenkill milk?
###582 JOSH OZERSKY: It's Battenkill milk!
###584 That's what Michael always had his cream sauces with the
###587 incredible yellow cream from Battenkill Farms.
###592 Sick.
###593 JOSH CAPON: The vanilla is the best.
###595 SERVERS: Thank you!
###596 MICHAEL WHITE: Take care.
###597 OLIVIA YOUNG: [INAUDIBLE].
###598 JOSH OZERSKY: Please tell me you can get back in the car.
###600 
###603 JOSH CAPON: [SINGING].
###604 
###607 JOSH OZERSKY: Why do you keep singing these strange songs?
###609 He's not annoying enough.
###611 I need him to be more annoying.
###612 JOSH CAPON: Why do you have to be a self-loathing fat man?
###614 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###617 MICHAEL WHITE: We're here.
###618 And then the munchies food frenzy
###620 started at Osteria Morini.
###621 
###626 One of the great parts about going to your own restaurants
###628 is you're there with your people.
###631 I text them and they were in the area so that's really how
###634 it happens a lot.
###635 We-- it's very hard to organize in the chef world.
###638 This is a pu pu platter.
###639 This is a Swiss chard and pancetta cake
###642 with parmigiano perma.
###646 We hit it pretty hard in the restaurant, so munchies
###649 happens like from the time we start to the time we end.
###652 It was loaded, loaded.
###654 But I would say our go-to food would be pizza.
###659 Pizza's a big deal.
###660 Did you guys know you were eating Nicoletta pizza
###662 tonight?
###662 -Nicoletta pizza!
###663 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###667 MICHAEL WHITE: I'm doing a Josh Ozersky
###668 special right now.
###669 It's going to be a meat-lover's.
###672 This is all wild fennel from Italy.
###673 
###677 And then we're going to put some of
###678 this thick-cut pepperoni.
###681 Because it has collagen casings, natural,
###683 and they cup up.
###685 I think pizza is probably the most satisfying thing.
###688 
###693 -We got a pizza!
###695 MICHAEL WHITE: This--
###696 there my friend, that's-- you're the first
###698 person having Nicoletta.
###699 I'm so excited about Nicoletta Pizzeria-- that's the new
###702 place I'm doing, and then to eat with those guys, because
###706 they're going to be tough on me, too.
###707 They're not going to hold back.
###709 JOSH OZERSKY: It's great!
###710 It's great!
###713 It's so good!
###716 It even has--
###717 it's got a little dom, it's got a little dom in it.
###721 MICHAEL WHITE: Josh kind of gave his this is good, this is
###724 better than I thought it was going to be.
###726 Which is kind of like a backhanded compliment, but I
###729 would expect nothing less from him.
###731 JOSH OZERSKY: This is great.
###732 Can I have some olive oil?
###733 
###736 MICHAEL WHITE: Oh shit.
###738 We got a lot of work to do, a lot of work to do.
###741 JOSH OZERSKY: I'm done.
###742 MICHAEL WHITE: I'm done-- that was an hour ago he was done.
###745 Is that it?
###745 Are you tapping out?
###746 JOSH OZERSKY: The time has come, the walrus said.
###749 MICHAEL WHITE: Josh has a poker face
###752 when he eats, though.
###753 He says, that's it, that's--
###755 I'm tapping out.
###755 That's it.
###756 I can tell there becomes a glaze on the face and he has
###759 to go out and get what we've coined as the "air bath, which
###762 means you have to go outside and like, air it out a second.
###766 JOSH CAPON: Don't forget [INAUDIBLE]
###767 Thai food.
###768 -I want nothing right now.
###769 Nothing.
###770 -You can have any item in the universe.
###772 [INAUDIBLE].
###773 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###774 
###776 -Leave us alone.
###777 -I don't want to eat anything.
###778 -There's no one item.
###779 -Just enjoy yourself.
###780
