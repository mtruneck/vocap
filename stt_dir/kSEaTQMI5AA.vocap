###3 THOMAS MORTON: You notice the soil here is super dark, and
###7 that is because in addition to being surrounded by rebel
###9 groups, Goma also sits at the base of an active volcano.
###12 
###24 Even from the land up, this area is just in a constant
###28 state of
###32 That woman's shirt says Vagina Warrior.
###34 
###49 Goma's the capitol city of the North Kivu Province of the
###51 Democratic Republic of Congo, and is situation in one of the
###54 world's worst geopolitical neighborhoods.
###57 To the southeast, there's the Rwandan border, which largely
###59 consists of mountain jungles through which scores of Hutu
###62 militants passed in the wake of the 1994 Rwandan genocide,
###66 fleeing the revenge of President Paul Kagame's newly
###68 elected Tutsi government for their role in the massacre.
###71 This armed migration directly contributed to the escalation
###73 of the First and Second Congo Wars, in which an estimated 5
###77 million people lost their lives.
###79 It was also through this transportation corridor that
###81 the Lord's Resistance Army, led by the infamous Joseph
###84 Kony, crossed the border from Uganda and drove deep into the
###87 heart of the Congo.
###88 While "Kony 2012" drew a lot of criticism for being less
###91 than diligent when it came to framing the quote unquote
###94 "facts" the documentary cited, what it did reveal is that the
###96 best way to reach jungle-bound dissidents wasn't through
###99 social media, but through good, old fashioned
###101 psychological operations--
###103 mostly in the tried and true forms of leaflet drops and
###106 radio broadcasts.
###108 -We don't benefit anything if we lie to you.
###111 We want to make sure you see the facts.
###113 And I'm sure you're going to decide to enter the DDR
###116 process voluntarily.
###119 THOMAS MORTON: So when the United Nations extended an
###120 invitation to embed with their operation in several locations
###123 across the country, our team gladly accepted.
###126 
###151 IAN ROWE: DDR is the Desarmement, Demobilization,
###154 Repatriation, Reinsertion, and Reintegration Program.
###156 The focus of the program is on foreign commands that are
###160 operating in the Congo.
###162 There's national reintegration programs which take over and
###166 facilitate their reinsertion into their
###168 communities of origin.
###169 The main approach that DDRRR has for trying to convince
###174 voluntary surrenders for subsequent repatriation is by
###180 radio sensitization.
###181 This involves using radio messages over FM networks.
###188 THOMAS MORTON: FM Uruguay 106.7.
###193 Siempre presente only the hits.
###194 All rock, no talk.
###197 -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###198 
###202 IAN ROWE: There's messages calling for them to lay down
###205 their weapons and return home.
###207 It lets them know that it is still possible to go home.
###212 THOMAS MORTON: Um-hm.
###213 IAN ROWE: Hope is not lost.
###214 Their families will be waiting for them and there's programs
###218 that will help them reinsert into their society.
###221 -This is one of our camps, the transit camp.
###224 And in this camp, we feed them three times a day.
###228 We provide them lodging, not this best one that you may
###232 think about, because we want to keep that temporarily so
###235 that they can go back to their country.
###237 We also give them access to telephone so that they can
###240 call their friends, relatives, and loved ones.
###242 -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###243 
###256 
###276 -Now, I will like to invite Mr. [INAUDIBLE]
###279 to address the ceremony.
###282 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, that's cool.
###283 I guess it's supposed to represent peace of some sort,
###288 but it kind of looks like one of those evil war birds from
###291 Pink Floyd's The Wall.
###293 
###299 So we're out on MONUSCO Base, the far eastern side, right on
###304 the border with Rwanda and Uganda.
###307 There's a whole bunch of rebel groups that kind of mix and
###311 merge and cross borders and take over this place.
###313 It's a real mess.
###314 The one most people know about, the Lord's Resistance
###317 Army, or LRA, are kind of the most notorious for their
###319 tactics, for using child soldiers, for abducting
###322 people, for setting entire churches
###324 full of folks on fire.
###325 There's another group called the M23, and are actually
###329 officially about 20 or 40 kilometers outside the city
###333 center, but we've heard closer to 10.
###335 These wars have been going on since the '90s in different
###339 little spurts.
###340 It's basically a permanent state of war for
###342 the Congolese people.
###345 It just varies, who they're fighting, at any one given
###348 time of the day.
###349 And so we're going to go with a little patrol, hopefully not
###352 get shot at.

###362 
###365 THOMAS MORTON: We got into Goma this morning.
###367 We just hooked up with a troop of Uruguay and UN soldiers who
###370 are going to give us a little tour of the city--
###373 see what a town that's basically spent 20 years at
###375 siege of rebel warfare looks like
###390 Besides the fragmented Lord's Resistance Army, the
###393 Democratic Republic of Congo is also home to militant
###395 groups such as the Mai-Mai, the Raia Mutomboki, and the
###399 Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda.
###402 But the greatest threat to regional stability could very
###404 well be a group known as M23.
###407 Led by Bosco Ntaganda, affectionately known by his
###409 troops as the Terminator, M23 mostly consists of Congolese
###413 Tutsis who defected from the army last April after alleging
###416 that the government in Kinshasa had violated peace
###419 accords signed on March 23, 2009, in which members of the
###422 now defunct CNDP were be absorbed into the country's
###425 regular army, the FRDC.
###429 The battle between M23 and government troops has raged so
###432 wildly that the United Nations has been forced to divert
###434 troops and resources sorely needed elsewhere in the
###436 country in order to get the government in Kinshasa a
###439 fighting chance.
###441 This, in turn, has created a security vacuum in which many
###444 of the armed groups in the area have rushed in to fill
###446 while reigniting the cycle of old tribal conflicts that were
###449 never really stamped out in the first place.
###451 These ethnic and geopolitical tensions are, in turn,
###454 exacerbating an already raging fight between local militias
###457 to control the illicit mining of cassiterite, wolframite,
###460 and coltan, minerals essential to the manufacturing of
###463 everything from smartphones to jet engines to airbags.
###467 
###470 Complicating matters further, it is widely believed that M23
###473 is receiving aid from the governments
###474 of Rwanda and Uganda.
###476 And it has been reported that the FDRC has approached the
###479 Hutu Mai-Mai for aid in fighting the largely Tutsi
###482 M23, background information largely omitted when President
###486 Obama ordered 100 US Special Forces to support regional
###490 powers in their search for our favorite madman of Facebook.
###493 BARACK OBAMA: And when the Lord's Resistance Army, led by
###496 Joseph Kony, continued its atrocities in Central Africa,
###501 I ordered a small number of American advisers to help
###503 Uganda and its neighbors pursue the LRA.
###506 
###514 THOMAS MORTON: So I'm not a big fan of the UN, in general.
###518 The track record has been spotty for
###520 all the 65, 67 years.
###526 They're famous for bringing the sex trade.
###529 It's basically anywhere they set up shop.
###530 
###549 As our team's tank patrol policed the streets of Goma's
###551 poorest neighborhoods, as well as power plants, airstrips,
###554 and crossroads--
###555 the kind of places a rebel army would likely attack--
###559 it became clear the UN troops were not preparing for a
###561 jungle assault, but for a potential attack by M23 on
###565 Goma itself.
###566 
###570 So obviously, the UN's here, on what they describe as a
###573 peacekeeping mission.
###574 They're supposed to mediate between all the different
###576 rebel groups and end the factions of army.
###579 There's different sections.
###580 The Congolese army, the Rwandan army, and the Ugandan
###583 armies do come in here.
###584 So it's supposed to be, basically, the babysitter, the
###586 grown-ups here.
###587 At the time, you're in a tank and they're soldiers.
###590 Little boy's like it, but it makes it feel kind of a little
###592 weird, like you're in an occupying army.
###595 I can't help but notice we've only really been in town.
###597 And it's kind of weird just to do a city patrol.
###601 It's almost more like you're policing the local population
###605 than on the lookout for rebel groups.
###607 Maybe there's something to be said for trying to convince
###609 locals not to go take up arms with M23.
###615 In the weeks that followed our initial visit to Goma,
###618 skirmishes between M23, Congolese troops, and the UN
###621 increased with regularity at strategic locations
###623 surrounding the city, with rebels even beginning to
###626 attack food, fuel, and supply convoys into town.
###629 
###667 Later, the UN invited our team to visit a camp in Goma set up
###670 to house rebel combatants who had recent surrendered to both
###673 the UN and FDRC.
###675 IAN ROWE: When escapees do come out, they're typically,
###678 at the moment, received by a community member that they
###681 perhaps cross in the road, or in the jungle, on their route,
###685 or something like that, and brought to the FRDC or to our
###691 military camp, where they'll be kept in our transit camp
###694 for maximum a week, within in which time they'll be
###699 processed in terms of getting their information, details,
###703 start doing the tracing for their families.
###705 We make contact with the Amnesty Commission in Uganda.
###708 And our counterparts in Entebbe-Kampala will meet us
###712 at the airport and we'll do a hand-over, after which they'll
###716 be reintegrated via whatever systems Uganda has in place.
###722 -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###723 
###734 IAN ROWE: From the women that have been abducted and kept as
###738 bush wives, oftentimes the reason that they're released
###741 is because they've been slowing down the LRA group
###743 that they're associated with.
###745 And so the fighters in the group made the decision that,
###749 for the purposes of allowing them to be more rapid moving,
###753 they would release these women and children.
###755 THOMAS MORTON: Now, when you say bush wives, that's a
###757 polite way of saying, like, sex slave, basically.
###760 IAN ROWE: Yes.
###760 These are women that have been abducted and used for sex as
###764 porters, all these most negative kind of uses that you
###769 could enumerate.
###771 THOMAS MORTON: Built on the ruins of a home previously
###773 belonging to deposed Congolese dictator Joseph Mobutu, the
###776 camp was split along ethnic and administrative lines with
###779 only a chain-link fence separating Hutu and Tutsi
###781 fighters, who out in the bush had been spilling each other's
###784 blood by the bucket for decades.
###786 The camp in Goma's indicative of the DRC's confusing
###789 geopolitical turmoil.
###790 Combatants staying at the campus must first surrender
###792 and hand over their weapons to UN or government troops, after
###796 which they are processed and held for 72 hours.
###799 A portion of the residents are from Rwanda, from which they
###801 fled to the DRC, joined a militia, became hired guns,
###805 and now want to return home.
###807 Other campers are Congolese who fought with local Hutu and
###810 Tutsi militias before surrendering.
###812 But there is also a contingent of Rwandan farmers who pose as
###815 ex-rebels in order to hitch a free ride with the UN back
###817 across the boarder.
###819 To determine their status and surmise their identities and
###821 countries of origin, they're quizzed on local facts and
###824 subjected to fingerprinting and retinal scans.
###826 The camp is an element of a UN program designed to transform
###829 rebels into civilians, reintegrating them back into
###832 society, or what's left of it.
###835 As the camp's public information officer, Sam
###837 Howard, gave us a walking tour of the side of the camp where
###839 some M23 fighters were housed, it became apparent that no one
###843 from the UN wanted to talk to our team about the confusing
###845 three-way battle raging between the M23 mutineers, the
###849 UN, and the FDRC.
###851 They were, however, more than happy to discuss other arm
###854 groups that are now less active, such as Joseph Kony
###856 and his LRA fighters--
###858 just not the real rebels standing next to us.
###861 The crumbling security situation in North Kivu has
###864 forced the hand of the UN and sparked a massive reallocation
###867 of UN assets to Goma from places like
###869 Dungu, Duru, and Bangadi.
###871 In the Orientale Province, places where the LRA were, and
###874 to some degree, still are active.
###876 
###927 
###944 THOMAS MORTON: The village of Dungu sits beside the quiet
###946 Uele River.
###947 The ruin of a Belgian Colonial castle faces become Kabali
###950 Hydroelectric Power Plant, which has been defunct for
###953 nearly three decades now.
###954 
###971 Beginning in September, 2008, the Lord's Resistance Army
###974 launched a series of brutal attacks in Dungu, kidnapping
###977 dozens, killing hundreds, and displacing an
###980 estimated 87,000 people.
###983 In an unusual display of brutality, the LRA fighters
###987 put aside their usual AK-47s and RPGs in favor of the
###990 machete and club.
###992 This brutality is still being felt in the damage to the
###995 area's already fragile infrastructure.
###997 And with no standing power grid or mobile phone network,
###1000 the only reliable method of mass communication are the FM
###1003 radio transmitters made available by
###1005 the UN's DDRRR program.

###1055 
###1067 THOMAS MORTON: Our team first saw examples of the UN PSYOPS
###1070 flyers with Sam Howard back at the transit camp in Goma.
###1073 Each contain instructions in several languages directing
###1075 LRA and other rebel combatants on the correction procedure
###1078 for safely surrendering for repatriation.
###1081 First, if you find a flyer, look for the correction FM
###1084 radio station to tune into for instructions of
###1086 where you can surrender.
###1088 Next, when the LRA goes to bed, make your escape under
###1091 the cover of darkness.
###1093 Third, surrender to the UN, FDRC, or another approved
###1097 African Union Force.
###1099 And finally, you will be reunited with your strangely
###1101 Asian-looking family.
###1103 
###1105 
###1109 THOMAS MORTON: It's all just LRA, right?
###1110 That's the dominant group.

###1333 IAN ROWE: Because in the past, the reaction from the
###1334 community, the affected communities, the ones that
###1336 they've attacked or terrorized in the past, their first
###1339 reaction is to kill them.
###1341 
###1357 THOMAS MORTON: The next morning, our team awoke before
###1359 dawn to take a 30-minute helicopter flight to Bangadi,
###1362 an area where the LRA has been and, to some degree, are still
###1365 very active.
###1366

###1919 brought to the fore.

###1973 
###1996 THOMAS MORTON: For the purposes of kind of disarming
###1997 these people and getting them to surrender, this ain't
###2000 helping, you know?
###2001 
###2021 European-style colonialism first made its way into the
###2024 Congo in 1876, after famed explorer Henry Stanley,
###2027 employed by Leopold II of Belgium, forced tribal chiefs
###2031 to sign treaties at gunpoint that essentially granted all
###2034 of their land rights to the European monarch.
###2037 Until 1908, Leopold ran the Congo as the Congo-Free State,
###2041 a private corporation with him as the sole
###2043 shareholder and as chairman.
###2045 It soon became clear that the corporation's profits were
###2048 built on a brutal occupation of the local people and
###2051 plunder of the Congo's natural resources--
###2053 namely, rubber.
###2055 In 1965, following a series of coups that ended the relative
###2059 stability of the newly independent nation, Laurent
###2062 Mobutu seized control of the state, changed the country's
###2065 name to Zaire, and for over 30 years, lead a brutal regime
###2069 built on Mobutu's own cult of personality.
###2071 By way of example, under Mobutu in a children's school,
###2074 Ronald Reagan would have been referred to as
###2076 the American Mobutu.
###2078 In May, 1997, Laurent Desire Kabila, father of the DRC's
###2083 current executive Joseph Kabila, ascended to the
###2085 presidency of Zaire and changed the country's name,
###2088 yet again, to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
###2090 Kabila the elder achieved this regime change through a
###2093 rebellion backed by Rwanda and which included a grand march
###2097 from the Kivus across 1,000 miles of some of the world's
###2100 densest jungle--
###2101 the same feat now threatened by the rebels of M23.
###2105 IAN ROWE: There's a very big difference from the work that
###2107 DDR does in the Kivus to the work
###2110 that they do in Orientale.
###2112 Whereas in the Kivus, most of the combatants that we're
###2116 trying to reach are more easily reachable.
###2120 There's a mobile network system here.
###2122 
###2124 There's the possibility to reach out and discuss and try
###2127 to negotiate with people to come in.
###2129 That doesn't exist in Orientale.
###2132 Up there, you're in the middle of the jungle.
###2133 There's no more mobile network.
###2134 There's no contact with anybody within the LRA.
###2137 There's no peace agreement.
###2139 So much of the work is based a lot on the belief and the
###2142 faith that the message is getting through them.
###2143 
###2161 There's now a new African Union initiative to implement
###2164 a strategy towards countering the LRA problem.
###2167 We also use our troops on the ground when
###2170 they do their patrols.
###2171 So we make a point of having only armed elements doing
###2174 that, whether it's from our side or the FRDC.
###2177 
###2193 THOMAS MORTON: During the patrol, we had persuaded the
###2194 convoy to drop our team off in Duru, a village hit hard by
###2198 the LRA's 2008 Dungu Offensive.
###2201 It is also where, according to local rumors, a small band of
###2204 fighters have been recently raiding local farms.
###2206 
###2218 There goes our convoy.
###2222 There's American J-Op Special Forces here who are being a
###2225 little bit cagey about what they're doing.
###2227 They just took off all of their insignia before crossing
###2230 into South Sudan, including their little flag patch, which
###2236 seems a little intriguing.
###2239 There was a national policemen from Burkina Faso.
###2242 He confirmed what we have kind of been picking up on this
###2246 whole time.
###2246 The LRA's weak and dead at this point.
###2250 I think it's kind of hype-driven.
###2252 I think the Kony 2012 Facebook campaign thing has sort of
###2257 swayed foreign policy towards sending troops here instead of
###2260 somewhere like Goma, where there's a huge buildup of M23
###2263 troops, which is basically where we're kind of needed
###2266 down here, instead of pursuing this dead, sort of starving
###2273 army of 400 people who only attack, at this
###2276 point, to get food.
###2278 We'll hang out here and see how people are doing four
###2282 years after the massacre.

###2653 THOMAS MORTON: Martin circled the LRA encampment at a safe
###2655 distance and waited for the moon to rise.
###2657 After his first shot rang out across the night sky, the LRA
###2660 men, lulled into a false sense of comfort, laid down their
###2663 weapons and promptly went to sleep.
###2666 After the promised knock against the tree echoed in the
###2668 darkness, Martin's son fled.
###2670 And the pair made their way safely back to the village.

###2721 CHRISTIAN KILUNDU: They saw a yellow paper.
###2723 And these guys, they tried to read that then.
###2725 They got we through the paper and they just read it.
###2728 And then they throw.
###2729 And then they said--

###2736 [LAUGHING]
###2737 THOMAS MORTON: That's pretty definitive.
###2739 
###2742 Almost everywhere we went, our team seemed to encounter
###2745 conflicting opinions regarding the reallocation of troops and
###2748 equipment across the country.
###2750 Regions where the LRA were still active feared the
###2752 security vacuum the had been left in by the UN and FDRC
###2755 movement of troops in support of the Kivus.
###2758 Back in the Kivus, for fear of showing of their hand to M23,
###2761 officials chose to focus on operations in provinces like
###2764 Orientale while seemingly ignoring the
###2766 wolf at their doorstep.
###2768 It seems that both fears were well-founded.
###2770 
###2777 I just walk back over every piece.
###2780 It's funny.
###2781 I was expecting to see one in the dog's mouth, and the
###2783 little kid's.
###2784 OK.
###2785 You ready?
###2786 
###2816 Morning.
###2817 We're out looking for hippos before our flight.
###2820 We're leaving town today.
###2822 No hippos so far.
###2823 I think they might still be in the grass, which is
###2826 disappointing, but also kind of an apt metaphor
###2828 for the LRA up here.
###2830 One thing that's sort of becoming clear, especially
###2833 seeing all the NGOs here, all the UN presence, all the
###2835 different agencies, Invisible Children are a good
###2838 organization, despite the fact that "Kony 2012" is a fucked
###2841 up piece of shit.
###2842 And there's this attitude that you see with all sorts of
###2844 NGOs, that they have, you know, a very narrow focus.
###2846 They're focused on one issue in a region, which is the way
###2850 you do things.
###2851 You concentrate, and you specialize.
###2853 But in an area as complex as Eastern Congo, where
###2856 everything's connected, you focus your troops up in the
###2859 north, where the LRA is.
###2861 You beat them in a manner of speaking, but all they've
###2864 really done is, as I keep saying, atomize the troops.
###2867 They split off into little groups of one and three.
###2869 They hid in the bush.
###2870 And now taking them down as a force is going to be
###2874 impossible.
###2874 It's going to take years and years and years.
###2876 These guys are going to stay here, and
###2878 they've reverted to banditry.
###2880 At the same time, the groups in the South, like the Mai-Mai
###2882 and the M23, have taken advantage of the focus of
###2886 attention on LRA to build up their forces.
###2888 Now, they're a major threat to the Lake Kivu area.

###3099 And there's no real way to do that.
###3104 Solutions will come.
###3105 The situation will improve eventually.
###3107 But this is 20 years of war.
###3109 That shit lingers.
###3111 People take it in.
###3112 And it becomes part of their lives.
###3113 War and retribution and the cycles that are continuing to
###3117 make it worse are a part of life here.
###3120 This camp's going to be here for a while.
###3121 These soldiers are all going to be here for a while.
###3123 People are going to be fighting and dying for a long
###3125 fucking time, no matter how many people
###3127 sign a Facebook petition.
