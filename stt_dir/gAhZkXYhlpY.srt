0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:13,13



2
0:0:13,13 --> 0:0:15,25
EDDIE ELGUERA: After the skate
camp was over, we started


3
0:0:15,25 --> 0:0:17,31
coming back, and I had
to get back home.


4
0:0:17,31 --> 0:0:18,87
We had been gone all summer.


5
0:0:18,87 --> 0:0:21,25
And then I kind of was moving
in another direction in my


6
0:0:21,25 --> 0:0:23,93
life, and from that time, he
went down to San Diego and


7
0:0:23,93 --> 0:0:25,9
started living there at
the H-Street House.


8
0:0:25,9 --> 0:0:29,5
And he just kind of went
off, and I was excited.


9
0:0:29,5 --> 0:0:31,175
ALPHONZO RAWLS: And after that
summer, he just never even


10
0:0:31,175 --> 0:0:32,2
went back home.


11
0:0:32,2 --> 0:0:34,14
I mean, to this day he just
never went back home.


12
0:0:34,14 --> 0:0:36,985
Sometimes he'd get stranded at
the H-Street House, and so he


13
0:0:36,985 --> 0:0:38,93
would call me, like Alph,
what are you doing?


14
0:0:38,93 --> 0:0:39,43
Come pick me up.


15
0:0:39,43 --> 0:0:40,68
Let's go skate, let's
go skate, whatever.


16
0:0:40,68 --> 0:0:43,5
And so we started kind
of hanging out.


17
0:0:43,5 --> 0:0:44,55
I'd come out and pick him up.


18
0:0:44,55 --> 0:0:47,78
And show him all the local
spots around and stuff.


19
0:0:47,78 --> 0:0:50,22
ERIC KOSTON: I skated
with him a lot, just


20
0:0:50,22 --> 0:0:50,92
those H-Street days.


21
0:0:50,92 --> 0:0:52,39
And we were filming
a lot together.


22
0:0:52,39 --> 0:0:55,23
I was just living at the
H-Street House at that point.


23
0:0:55,23 --> 0:0:59,47
And I was 16, probably still.


24
0:0:59,47 --> 0:1:0,69
ALPHONZO RAWLS: Coincidentally,
here's


25
0:1:0,69 --> 0:1:3,19
something that some people might
not know about me and


26
0:1:3,19 --> 0:1:5,93
Eric, but coincidentally, we
were born in the same hospital


27
0:1:5,93 --> 0:1:7,32
in Bangkok, Thailand.


28
0:1:7,32 --> 0:1:10,25
My mom's Thai, and Eric's
mom's Thai.


29
0:1:10,25 --> 0:1:12,85
I was talking to my mom, and she
said, yeah, I mean, at the


30
0:1:12,85 --> 0:1:16,1
time, that was the only
hospital in Bangkok.


31
0:1:16,1 --> 0:1:19,23
So it was kind of interesting to
find that out years after.


32
0:1:19,23 --> 0:1:20,95
Yeah, I mean, we hung
out every day.


33
0:1:20,95 --> 0:1:22,11
We're close buds.


34
0:1:22,11 --> 0:1:25,28
I mean, he was like,
that was my dude.


35
0:1:25,28 --> 0:1:26,23
You know what I mean?


36
0:1:26,23 --> 0:1:28,3
We hung out every day, and we
just did a lot of things


37
0:1:28,3 --> 0:1:28,72
together, and stuff.


38
0:1:28,72 --> 0:1:30,89
And so we kept each
other motivated to


39
0:1:30,89 --> 0:1:32,0
keep this thing moving.


40
0:1:32,0 --> 0:1:34,65
I actually got sponsored
for skating vert.


41
0:1:34,65 --> 0:1:37,5
I mean, not that I labeled
myself a vert skater, but all


42
0:1:37,5 --> 0:1:39,2
in all, we always skated
everything.


43
0:1:39,2 --> 0:1:40,47
Whatever was available to us.


44
0:1:40,47 --> 0:1:42,89
I mean, back in the days, it
was kind of like that.


45
0:1:42,89 --> 0:1:44,76
I mean, it wasn't like you're
a vert skater or a street


46
0:1:44,76 --> 0:1:45,44
skater, or whatever.


47
0:1:45,44 --> 0:1:48,79
For the most part, everyone
skated everything.


48
0:1:48,79 --> 0:1:51,35
ERIC KOSTON: No, I think skating
with him just helped


49
0:1:51,35 --> 0:1:53,28
me get better on tranny.


50
0:1:53,28 --> 0:1:56,93
When I grew up, in that time,
you skated everything anyways.


51
0:1:56,93 --> 0:1:58,96
You know, you still didn't
have to sort of define


52
0:1:58,96 --> 0:2:1,31
yourself as like a street
or a vert dude.


53
0:2:1,31 --> 0:2:3,17
I just wanted to be good
at everything.


54
0:2:3,17 --> 0:2:5,385
I mean, vert was one of the
toughest things, though, for


55
0:2:5,385 --> 0:2:6,31
me, for sure.


56
0:2:6,31 --> 0:2:9,52
But I want to be good
on everything.


57
0:2:9,52 --> 0:2:11,73
ALPHONZO RAWLS: You know, the
thing that I noticed about


58
0:2:11,73 --> 0:2:15,64
Koston growing up is he's just
one of those dudes that's kind


59
0:2:15,64 --> 0:2:17,0
of good at whatever he does.


60
0:2:17,0 --> 0:2:20,56
The kids these days would
be amazed at how sick


61
0:2:20,56 --> 0:2:22,57
Koston is on vert.


62
0:2:22,57 --> 0:2:25,17
He's gotten more recognition
for his street skating, but


63
0:2:25,17 --> 0:2:26,86
all in all, I mean, he can
really skate anything.


64
0:2:26,86 --> 0:2:29,48
I bet he'd be able to even skate
Mega Ramp if wanted to.


65
0:2:29,48 --> 0:2:31,13
Anything I'd ever seen
him try to do,


66
0:2:31,13 --> 0:2:33,15
he was good at naturally.


67
0:2:33,15 --> 0:2:36,2
But it was almost depressing,
like, I'd be trying a trick or


68
0:2:36,2 --> 0:2:38,77
whatever, and he'd come up
just goofing around.


69
0:2:38,77 --> 0:2:40,95
He's just come through and just
do to manual, or out of a


70
0:2:40,95 --> 0:2:42,32
manual, or something.


71
0:2:42,32 --> 0:2:43,73
He's just that good.


72
0:2:43,73 --> 0:2:44,71
ATIBA JEFFERSON:
I knew of Eric.


73
0:2:44,71 --> 0:2:48,2
Like, I was a huge beyond fan.


74
0:2:48,2 --> 0:2:49,21
Like, Koston was a god.


75
0:2:49,21 --> 0:2:52,61
Koston was my favorite
skater as a kid.


76
0:2:52,61 --> 0:2:53,6
Number one.


77
0:2:53,6 --> 0:2:56,92
His H-Street part, I loved
his H-Street part.


78
0:2:56,92 --> 0:2:59,87
It was like, dude, this
dude's the best.


79
0:2:59,87 --> 0:3:1,66
MALE SPEAKER: Was H-Street
Next the video that you


80
0:3:1,66 --> 0:3:3,6
actually like, went out
and filmed for?


81
0:3:3,6 --> 0:3:5,23
Your first time filming
a part?


82
0:3:5,23 --> 0:3:6,85
ERIC KOSTON: Yeah, yeah.


83
0:3:6,85 --> 0:3:8,335
I remember going out and filming
with Ternasky when he


84
0:3:8,335 --> 0:3:9,82
was still at H-Street,
you know?


85
0:3:9,82 --> 0:3:15,28
Then he broke out and did Plan
B. By then we'd found out Plan


86
0:3:15,28 --> 0:3:16,76
B was being formed.


87
0:3:16,76 --> 0:3:18,635
It's like, yeah,
Eddie told me.


88
0:3:18,635 --> 0:3:20,4
He's like yeah, they're
starting a company.


89
0:3:20,4 --> 0:3:21,3
Ternasky's leaving.


90
0:3:21,3 --> 0:3:23,91
GUY MARIANO: I'm sure like, Mike
Ternasky was really good


91
0:3:23,91 --> 0:3:27,22
with picking out dudes that
still, to this day, are in the


92
0:3:27,22 --> 0:3:30,9
industry, and like some of the
best, you know what I mean?


93
0:3:30,9 --> 0:3:32,66
And I'm sure Mike Ternasky had
his eye on Eric, and wanted


94
0:3:32,66 --> 0:3:33,65
him on the team.


95
0:3:33,65 --> 0:3:36,22
That would have been amazing to
see like, Koston on Plan B.


96
0:3:36,22 --> 0:3:38,15
I've never even thought of that,
but like, just when you


97
0:3:38,15 --> 0:3:40,86
said that, I'm just like wow,
that would be amazing.


98
0:3:40,86 --> 0:3:43,73
AARON MEZA: James Kelch was
like, I'm trying to get on


99
0:3:43,73 --> 0:3:45,62
Plan B. That's why
I was filming.


100
0:3:45,62 --> 0:3:47,86
He wanted me to film him for a
sponsor video, and he said


101
0:3:47,86 --> 0:3:51,29
Plan B was going to be like, the
dudes that are on it, the


102
0:3:51,29 --> 0:3:52,56
people that everybody
knows that are on.


103
0:3:52,56 --> 0:3:54,28
And he said like, also
like Jason Carney.


104
0:3:54,28 --> 0:3:56,3
And I think he said
Eric Koston.


105
0:3:56,3 --> 0:3:59,7
And that's probably the first
time that it had maybe dawned


106
0:3:59,7 --> 0:4:1,3
on me that Eric must
be really good.


107
0:4:1,3 --> 0:4:3,76
MIKE CARROLL: I knew Mike wanted
to put him on Plan B,


108
0:4:3,76 --> 0:4:6,29
and I think he was in the
name of the ams, or


109
0:4:6,29 --> 0:4:7,19
something like that.


110
0:4:7,19 --> 0:4:8,55
But I didn't really know
him that well, so I


111
0:4:8,55 --> 0:4:9,51
was just like, oh.


112
0:4:9,51 --> 0:4:10,71
MALE SPEAKER: But do you think
that was more because you


113
0:4:10,71 --> 0:4:11,62
didn't know him, or more--


114
0:4:11,62 --> 0:4:12,99
MIKE CARROLL: I think it was
more just because I just


115
0:4:12,99 --> 0:4:14,8
didn't really know him.


116
0:4:14,8 --> 0:4:15,24
I just didn't really care.


117
0:4:15,24 --> 0:4:16,18
You know what I mean?


118
0:4:16,18 --> 0:4:18,149
Because I know people have
always given me shit.


119
0:4:18,149 --> 0:4:19,37
Like, oh, you didn't
want him on.


120
0:4:19,37 --> 0:4:21,43
But I mean, that was just more
about, like, I knew Shawn.


121
0:4:21,43 --> 0:4:23,6
I knew Rick, you know?


122
0:4:23,6 --> 0:4:26,82
So I was just like, let's
put these people on.


123
0:4:26,82 --> 0:4:28,85
GUY MARIANO: And especially at
that time, everybody was


124
0:4:28,85 --> 0:4:29,72
really young.


125
0:4:29,72 --> 0:4:31,98
There was like, a lot of shit
talkers and whatnot.


126
0:4:31,98 --> 0:4:34,74
With any person that's really
good at what they do, people


127
0:4:34,74 --> 0:4:36,81
are going to be intimidated, and
they're going to fear it a


128
0:4:36,81 --> 0:4:37,46
little bit.


129
0:4:37,46 --> 0:4:39,61
It was just probably people
jealous that he was such a


130
0:4:39,61 --> 0:4:42,8
good skater trying to hate on
him, you know what I mean?


131
0:4:42,8 --> 0:4:46,26
MALE SPEAKER: Was there talk
of you going to Plan B?


132
0:4:46,26 --> 0:4:47,45
ERIC KOSTON: Yeah.


133
0:4:47,45 --> 0:4:48,55
It was crazy.


134
0:4:48,55 --> 0:4:51,88
I was with Eddie, and we
drove to the contest.


135
0:4:51,88 --> 0:4:53,84
Tony Mag wants me to
enter the contest.


136
0:4:53,84 --> 0:4:57,27
I was like, I don't want
to enter the contest.


137
0:4:57,27 --> 0:4:58,34
I don't want to be pro.


138
0:4:58,34 --> 0:5:1,3
Like, I'm not ready
to be a pro.


139
0:5:1,3 --> 0:5:4,0
Like, if I do this, I'm pro.


140
0:5:4,0 --> 0:5:4,38
That's what it was.


141
0:5:4,38 --> 0:5:5,82
It was like, a contest,
you know?


142
0:5:5,82 --> 0:5:9,57
Ternasky pulls me aside
and goes, hey man.


143
0:5:9,57 --> 0:5:10,68
Don't enter this contest.


144
0:5:10,68 --> 0:5:12,7
I want you to ride for Plan B.
I want you to be an am for


145
0:5:12,7 --> 0:5:16,74
Plan B. There was the pressure
that quitting, being 16 and


146
0:5:16,74 --> 0:5:20,895
like, having to turn pro
all like in one day.


147
0:5:20,895 --> 0:5:24,1



148
0:5:24,1 --> 0:5:25,37
I'm with Eddie.


149
0:5:25,37 --> 0:5:28,83
He wants me to like, just,
you know, say no.


150
0:5:28,83 --> 0:5:30,24
Quit on the spot.


151
0:5:30,24 --> 0:5:32,2
Ternasky's like, Eddie
will understand.


152
0:5:32,2 --> 0:5:33,76
I was like, dude, I can't
do that to Eddie.


153
0:5:33,76 --> 0:5:34,89
I can't, you know?


154
0:5:34,89 --> 0:5:36,87
Like, I can't quit H-Street.


155
0:5:36,87 --> 0:5:37,81
I can't.


156
0:5:37,81 --> 0:5:38,23
EDDIE ELGUERA: Yeah.


157
0:5:38,23 --> 0:5:41,45
It's one of those things that,
you know, when you're that


158
0:5:41,45 --> 0:5:44,87
good, everybody's going
to come at you.


159
0:5:44,87 --> 0:5:46,91
I think what he did was great.


160
0:5:46,91 --> 0:5:48,75
I think he did it
the right way.


161
0:5:48,75 --> 0:5:50,68
GUY MARIANO: Eric didn't just
like, bounce at the first


162
0:5:50,68 --> 0:5:53,18
opportunity to go in this super
team that was being


163
0:5:53,18 --> 0:5:54,3
created, you know what I mean?


164
0:5:54,3 --> 0:5:56,77
That's cool that Eric had some
loyalty at such a young age,


165
0:5:56,77 --> 0:5:58,93
when a lot of people were
bouncing around.


166
0:5:58,93 --> 0:6:2,645
ALPHONZO RAWLS: After half the
crew broke apart and did Plan


167
0:6:2,645 --> 0:6:5,7
B, there was a greater
appreciation for the people


168
0:6:5,7 --> 0:6:5,81
that remained.


169
0:6:5,81 --> 0:6:10,78
For whatever reason, Tony Mag
kind of valued me more than


170
0:6:10,78 --> 0:6:12,486
Koston in regards, to you know,
what he wanted to pay


171
0:6:12,486 --> 0:6:12,96
him and stuff.


172
0:6:12,96 --> 0:6:15,36
And so I think I might have
convinced Mag, if we were


173
0:6:15,36 --> 0:6:17,92
hoping to be a brand for any
more time, you know,


174
0:6:17,92 --> 0:6:20,99
definitely Koston is
the main dude.


175
0:6:20,99 --> 0:6:22,96
Let's give him more money.


176
0:6:22,96 --> 0:6:25,91
ERIC KOSTON: I remember Alphonzo
going to Tony, like


177
0:6:25,91 --> 0:6:27,34
sort of strong arming
him, like, you've


178
0:6:27,34 --> 0:6:28,63
got to pay Eric more.


179
0:6:28,63 --> 0:6:31,3
We're going to get
an apartment.


180
0:6:31,3 --> 0:6:34,2
He was living with his mom, so
he kind of strong armed Tony


181
0:6:34,2 --> 0:6:39,4
to pay me like, $500 a month
so I can cover some rent.


182
0:6:39,4 --> 0:6:41,7
MALE SPEAKER: You were
pro for H-Street.


183
0:6:41,7 --> 0:6:42,82
ERIC KOSTON: I was pro.


184
0:6:42,82 --> 0:6:43,72
MALE SPEAKER: Did you have
a board on H-Street?


185
0:6:43,72 --> 0:6:46,84
ERIC KOSTON: I had a board, and
it was like this horrible,


186
0:6:46,84 --> 0:6:47,9
like greeting card.


187
0:6:47,9 --> 0:6:49,88
It was like, an old lady
all wrinkled up.


188
0:6:49,88 --> 0:6:50,81
It was just a bad
illustration.


189
0:6:50,81 --> 0:6:52,67
And I was like, oh,
this is funny.


190
0:6:52,67 --> 0:6:55,7
This would be a funny graphic,
being a kid.


191
0:6:55,7 --> 0:6:57,54
Tony, should we make
this as a graphic?


192
0:6:57,54 --> 0:7:2,21
And that's how simple
it was back then.


193
0:7:2,21 --> 0:7:3,4
It didn't come out
until I quit.


194
0:7:3,4 --> 0:7:6,0
A few of them leaked,
and kind of got out.


195
0:7:6,0 --> 0:7:7,81
A couple hundred, I guess.


196
0:7:7,81 --> 0:7:9,39
They did get to shops.


197
0:7:9,39 --> 0:7:11,43
ATIBA JEFFERSON: I remember his
first board on H-Street,


198
0:7:11,43 --> 0:7:13,32
though, at the state
shop I worked at.


199
0:7:13,32 --> 0:7:14,45
Had the grandma.


200
0:7:14,45 --> 0:7:18,4
It wouldn't sell, because like
right when that board came


201
0:7:18,4 --> 0:7:19,26
out, he was on 101.


202
0:7:19,26 --> 0:7:20,72
So everyone was like, 101.


203
0:7:20,72 --> 0:7:23,95
And it sucks to this day,
because I wish that I would


204
0:7:23,95 --> 0:7:26,4
have grabbed that board,
not knowing.


205
0:7:26,4 --> 0:7:29,595
ERIC KOSTON: Years ago, Pat
Chanita had come up to me and


206
0:7:29,595 --> 0:7:31,31
said, hey man, I got
one of your boards.


207
0:7:31,31 --> 0:7:33,25
I stole it from Tony.


208
0:7:33,25 --> 0:7:35,5
I got your first
H-Street board.


209
0:7:35,5 --> 0:7:36,74
I want to give it to you.


210
0:7:36,74 --> 0:7:39,3
And Pat Chanita had stolen
it, and he wanted


211
0:7:39,3 --> 0:7:40,1
to give it to me.


212
0:7:40,1 --> 0:7:41,8
And he gave it to me, finally.


213
0:7:41,8 --> 0:7:42,72
It finally got to me.


214
0:7:42,72 --> 0:7:49,35
Yeah, it was sick that he
thought that I would want it.


215
0:7:49,35 --> 0:7:50,31
And I did.


216
0:7:50,31 --> 0:7:53,68
I was like, dude,
yeah, totally.


217
0:7:53,68 --> 0:7:54,69
ATIBA JEFFERSON: It wouldn't
even sell.


218
0:7:54,69 --> 0:7:56,4
We ended up like,
giving it away.


219
0:7:56,4 --> 0:7:58,63
And this is when no one
got a free board.


220
0:7:58,63 --> 0:8:0,13
That was like, unheard of.


221
0:8:0,13 --> 0:8:3,48
I remember my friends from
Deluxe would send me a board,


222
0:8:3,48 --> 0:8:5,31
and I'd be like, oh my god.


223
0:8:5,31 --> 0:8:6,56
I just got a free board.


224
0:8:6,56 --> 0:10:6,56
