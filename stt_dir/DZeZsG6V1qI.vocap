###13 FRED GALL: See, if I brought some dudes to this, they'd be
###15 like, are you fucking serious, man?
###18 I don't know if I'm gonna be able to rig this one.
###20 I'll try, though.
###21 
###29 Fuck it, let's move on.
###31 That's good enough, right?
###32 PATRICK O'DELL: Hi.
###32 Welcome back to the Epically Later'd show.
###34 This episode, I went out to Jersey, met up with Fred Gall.
###40 He took me around.
###41 We looked at spots, incredibly crappy spots that you gotta
###45 skate if you're from New Jersey or if you're from the
###47 East Coast.
###49 I think Fred brought something refreshing to
###51 skating in the mid-'90s.
###53 Those Eastern Exposure videos were just guys hauling ass
###56 down the street, skating switch--
###59 you know, pole jams and late shove-its and stuff.
###62 [CHEERING]
###63 PATRICK O'DELL: That's it.
###64 This is a day in the life with Freddy Gall.
###67 FRED GALL: So what's up, man?
###68 Check it out.
###69 You know, usually all these pro skaters, they got their
###72 hot rides and shit.
###73 Well, I rock my grandmother's station wagon, man.
###76 Love this car.
###79 I learned to ollie in this driveway, actually.
###80 I'll show you.
###82 I have a parking block that we stole when I was 10 years old,
###86 and it's still there.
###87 It's been in my grandmother's driveway for 18 years.
###89 PATRICK O'DELL: You're still the skate whiz to her?
###92 FRED GALL: Yeah.
###93 28-year-old skate whiz.
###96 We'll go meet her right now.
###99 Hello.
###101 Hi.
###102 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh.
###104 Not me.
###105 FRED GALL: Well, now it's a flower--
###107 
###111 FRED GALL: It's all right.
###111 I'm just showing them.
###112 Yeah, this has been here for 18 years now.
###117 Used to slide good.
###118 I don't know, it doesn't look like it anymore.
###121 No complies and stuff.
###122 It's pretty funny.
###125 FEMALE SPEAKER: He had a ramp right there.
###127 And he would skate all day, all night, clunking away.
###133 And of course, I took him to all the stores
###135 to get him his clothes.
###137 You see, I don't understand his profession.
###144 I don't understand it.
###146 And when he'd say, look it, I'm getting a sponsor.
###148 Look at my picture in a magazine, or on the boards and
###152 the sneakers.
###154 I couldn't comprehend.
###155 How could this all happen?
###158 FRED GALL: This is my first board graphic.
###160 Neil Blender drew it on, like, a napkin or
###162 something like that.
###164 And I was pretty hyped.
###165 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we're very proud of him.
###167 Except get a job, Fred.
###170 Yeah, we all care and love Freddy.
###173 He can do no wrong in my eyes.
###175 I'll tell you that.
###176 You can lambast him once in a while, but--
###180 PATRICK O'DELL: What do you mean?
###180 FEMALE SPEAKER: Huh?
###180 PATRICK O'DELL: What do you mean, lambasted?
###183 FEMALE SPEAKER: Lambasting.
###184 PATRICK O'DELL: What does that--
###185 FEMALE SPEAKER: Just slapping him, you know.
###187 JAKE PHELPS: Oh, I would say Frank the Tank, that's '94.
###191 Switch 5-0 hubba hideout on the cover.
###194 I think he came out here and he pretty much blew it out.
###197 I think it was in the Eastern Exposure
###199 vid, he did some shit--
###203 Freddy, he's a really good skater.
###204 He still is a great skater.
###207 And he went for it.
###208 I could see this look on his face that he genuinely had the
###210 same stoke that he had when he was a little kid when he first
###214 bombed a hill on his driveway.
###215 DAEWON SONG: He's been around for a while.
###216 He's one person you can say paid his dues.
###219 Eastern Exposure videos, all that stuff, yeah.
###222 He's one of the guys.
###224 He's more raw.
###224 He's kind of like a Ricky Oyola.
###226 There's so many different types of skating nowadays that
###229 it's good you got those guys around.
###232 FRED GALL: I mean, I watch them till this day, and they
###233 get my psyched to go skate and whatnot.
###237 It's just a good vibe and that.
###239 It's like, we never really had a legit filmer.
###242 Dan was the first dude to come and film.
###245 And we'd be so psyched, because it was so clean and
###248 looked so legit that that's what actually got us real
###251 hyped on film, was his style of filming and him being down
###255 to just come down to Philly all the time and just film.
###259 Other than that, we would just film each other
###261 with whoever's camera.
###263 Back then, it was just like everything was new, so you
###266 could just do whatever.
###267 And it was all tricks no one had done.
###270 I mean, now I'll go out and fucking pull my hair out
###274 sometimes trying to film video parts, because you gotta keep
###277 it up to par.
###278 
###284 PATRICK O'DELL: You think there's some way in that all
###286 the Jersey skaters are similar?
###288 FRED GALL: Yeah, definitely.
###289 I mean, people who grow up in Cali and they got all the
###292 perfect ground at the schools and stuff-- like, we're used
###294 to skating shitty spots.
###296 They always look great on film.
###298 They always look cool and definitely different.
###300 
###305 MALE SPEAKER: Damn.
###306 FRED GALL: I bring people to some spots and
###308 they hate them, man.
###308 And they're just like, how the fuck do you skate this shit?
###311 I don't know, I like that shit.
###313 
###316 We would skate New York City a lot before Newark.
###320 I mean, because it's always real ghetto.
###321 But just search it out, and there's definitely spots.
###324 
###330 Check it out.
###331 Up here's--
###333 this is Seth Boyden, some of the most
###335 dangerous projects in Newark.
###337 It'll be up here on the right.
###339 Yeah I wouldn't--
###340 I don't know.
###340 If there was a spot in there--
###341 FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].
###343 FRED GALL: --I'd probably go skate it.
###345 I've definitely put myself into bad situations before.
###348 I actually got robbed in Albany a couple months back.
###354 I got fucking hit in the face.
###356 I don't know what he hit me with, but it wasn't no fist
###358 because it fucking broke my sinus cavity right here, and
###362 fractured this cheek bone.
###364 PATRICK O'DELL: So how old were you when you were
###365 skating, first starting to go to New York City?
###368 FRED GALL: Like, 11 years old, I think.
###370 It was in my first banks contest.
###373 And my mom used to bring me and shit.
###374 She would pull the car right up.
###376 That's when the banks were like, you could do anything.
###378 Just park at the banks.
###380 My mom would drink tall cans of beer while
###382 I skated all day.
###384 My mom made me this shirt.
###387 And it's--
###389 what was going to be my-- it was a joking graphic, but she
###392 just drew kicking down the Twin Towers.
###395 And now look what happened now.
###397 They really fell down.
###398 It's fucked up.
###400 It's kind of spooky, man.
###402 This was given to me, dude.
###403 I went to my friend's house.
###405 He's like, yeah, I got a Hosoi board.
###407 I'm like, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
###409 You got a original Hosoi board?
###411 He's like, here, you can have it.
###413 I was like, thank you so much, dude.
###416 What can I give to you?
###417 PATRICK O'DELL: Do you have any boards that you've skated,
###420 like, old boards that--
###422 FRED GALL: See, you could ask my grandmother about that one,
###424 because my basement used to be stacked up with Alva boards,
###427 every single board I had in my life.
###429 And she likes to throw things out.
###431 And I came over one day and they were gone.
###433 And I go, no, you didn't.
###435 Please tell me you didn't.
###436 Yeah, she threw, like, 50 boards away.
###441 PATRICK O'DELL: He seems like he's had comebacks over and
###444 over, like he's one of those people that--
###446 JAKE PHELPS: Well, I think that he can
###447 do whatever he wants.
###448 I mean, a lot of skaters are like that.
###450 I mean, just because someone's not doing something-- do you
###453 think Heath and Fowler can't still fucking ollie over your
###456 fucking car?
###457 Do you think Julian still bombs hills?
###460 Yeah, probably.
###462 FRED GALL: This is my backyard, basically.
###465 Grew up hitching trains over here, painting them, whatever.
###468 The freight yard's there, so it's like a
###470 playground back here.
###471 
###474 I don't know if you should put the weed part in, but you can
###478 film it anyway.
###479 
###483 Because Granny's gonna wanna watch it.
###485 
###490 I mean, I've taken them far as hell this way, but I've gotten
###494 really worked as a kid holding on to the back.
###498 And it really starts hauling ass, and you gotta jump off on
###500 to this shit.
###501 I don't know, man.
###502 I got severely worked, and I didn't do
###505 it for a while again.
###507 Just land and just cut up everywhere.
###509
