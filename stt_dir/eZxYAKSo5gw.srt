But in the 1980s, as the walls
in Eastern Europe were coming


11

freaky happened--

33
0:1:56,32 --> 0:1:57,91
SHANE SMITH: So right after the
Russian Revolution in the


34
0:1:57,91 --> 0:2:1,31
1920s, there was a big
creative explosion of


35
0:2:1,31 --> 0:2:4,23
experimental cinema in
the new Soviet Union.


36
0:2:4,23 --> 0:2:5,73
Vertov, Eisenstein--


37
0:2:5,73 --> 0:2:7,38
all the big boys were
making their films.


38
0:2:7,38 --> 0:2:10,9



39
0:2:10,9 --> 0:2:14,32
Lenin believed that film was the
most important of artistic


40
0:2:14,32 --> 0:2:17,21
expression, because most of the
people were illiterate.


41
0:2:17,21 --> 0:2:18,84
But then Stalin took over.


42
0:2:18,84 --> 0:2:22,36
And then you have 60 years
of socialist realism--


43
0:2:22,36 --> 0:2:24,87
workers going off to work,
farmers going off to farms,


44
0:2:24,87 --> 0:2:27,34
soldiers going off to soldier,
et cetera, et cetera.


45
0:2:27,34 --> 0:2:30,32
Until the 1980s, when the
Soviet regime started to


46
0:2:30,32 --> 0:2:33,55
crumble and Gorbachev brought
about Perestroika and


47
0:2:33,55 --> 0:2:36,87
Glasnost, which means
restructuring and reforming.


48
0:2:36,87 --> 0:2:39,97
And for a tiny little window,
there was a time when you


49
0:2:39,97 --> 0:2:42,665
think, maybe I could make
something and the KBG won't


50
0:2:42,665 --> 0:2:44,37
put me in jail for the
rest of my life.


51
0:2:44,37 --> 0:2:47,67

started for the first


52
0:2:47,67 --> 0:2:48,6

on saying, you
