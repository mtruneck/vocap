1
0:0:0,967 --> 0:0:2,735
Travis Taylor: Now on
Rocket City Rednecks.


2
0:0:2,735 --> 0:0:4,303
We're helping our
troops by building


3
0:0:4,303 --> 0:0:8,274
an armor suit that
protects the entire body.


4
0:0:8,274 --> 0:0:9,775
We'll find out
if our armor suit


5
0:0:9,775 --> 0:0:12,411
can take the
physical abuse.


6
0:0:12,411 --> 0:0:15,548
I can run a
marathon in this thing.


7
0:0:15,548 --> 0:0:17,817
But can the guy wearing
the suit take the abuse


8
0:0:17,817 --> 0:0:21,487
dished out by a real
marine drill instructor?


9
0:0:21,487 --> 0:0:24,857
Bodette: You ain't
got time to be tired.


10
0:0:24,857 --> 0:0:26,58
Travis Taylor:
I'm Travis Taylor.


11
0:0:26,58 --> 0:0:27,526
I'm a rocket scientist
in the space and


12
0:0:27,526 --> 0:0:29,195
defense industry here
in my hometown of


13
0:0:29,195 --> 0:0:30,93
Huntsville, Alabama


14
0:0:30,93 --> 0:0:32,731
where my daddy helped
build the rockets


15
0:0:32,731 --> 0:0:34,2
that sent us
to the moon.


16
0:0:34,2 --> 0:0:35,234
Daddy: Have y'all
been drinking


17
0:0:35,234 --> 0:0:36,869
rocket fuel again?


18
0:0:36,869 --> 0:0:38,17
Travis Taylor:
Sometimes big science


19
0:0:38,17 --> 0:0:39,638
moves too slow for me.


20
0:0:39,638 --> 0:0:41,24
So come the
weekend I round up


21
0:0:41,24 --> 0:0:42,908
my best friend Rog.


22
0:0:42,908 --> 0:0:43,976
Rog: Hey!


23
0:0:43,976 --> 0:0:45,377
Travis Taylor: My
nephew Michael and


24
0:0:45,377 --> 0:0:46,879
my buddy Pete to
tackle important


25
0:0:46,879 --> 0:0:50,616
problems with a little
down-home ingenuity.


26
0:0:50,616 --> 0:0:55,154
Rog: Damn it, boy.


27
0:0:55,154 --> 0:0:56,255
Travis Taylor: Right on.


28
0:0:56,255 --> 0:1:0,192
Hey, is there any more
beers in the cooler?


29
0:1:0,192 --> 0:1:1,727
Today we are doing
a little shooting,


30
0:1:1,727 --> 0:1:4,697
but it's not
just for fun.


31
0:1:4,697 --> 0:1:7,266
My big brother,
Michael's Daddy


32
0:1:7,266 --> 0:1:9,468
he's in the Air Force
and he tells all the time


33
0:1:9,468 --> 0:1:11,3
about this big
armored jacket that


34
0:1:11,3 --> 0:1:12,571
he has to
wear when he goes


35
0:1:12,571 --> 0:1:13,939
into combat situations.


36
0:1:13,939 --> 0:1:15,674
There has got to
be better way.


37
0:1:15,674 --> 0:1:17,376
So we're doing some
baseline testing of


38
0:1:17,376 --> 0:1:20,79
military issued body
armor to see if we can


39
0:1:20,79 --> 0:1:21,647
come up with a
lighter version that


40
0:1:21,647 --> 0:1:24,25
works just as
good or better.


41
0:1:24,25 --> 0:1:25,851
Michael: My daddy wears
one of these all the time


42
0:1:25,851 --> 0:1:28,654
so it be good to put
something else out there


43
0:1:28,654 --> 0:1:30,489
as an option that
could be better.


44
0:1:30,489 --> 0:1:31,991
Travis Taylor:
Holy crap.


45
0:1:31,991 --> 0:1:33,425
Pete: I was really
surprised at how


46
0:1:33,425 --> 0:1:35,928
well the vest stood
up to gunfire.


47
0:1:35,928 --> 0:1:37,963
A typical military
vest is sewn out of


48
0:1:37,963 --> 0:1:41,167
multiple layers of Kevlar,
which is a synthetic woven


49
0:1:41,167 --> 0:1:44,136
fabric that is 5 times
stronger than steel.


50
0:1:44,136 --> 0:1:45,504
Travis Taylor: Pull
that plate out.


51
0:1:45,504 --> 0:1:48,24
Kevlar alone can stop
certain ammunition.


52
0:1:48,24 --> 0:1:50,276
The vest also
holds armor plates.


53
0:1:50,276 --> 0:1:51,944
And this piece
right here.


54
0:1:51,944 --> 0:1:53,646
Pete: That's what,
boron carbonate?


55
0:1:53,646 --> 0:1:55,314
Travis Taylor: That's
boron carbonate or


56
0:1:55,314 --> 0:1:56,782
silicate carbonate
look at that.


57
0:1:56,782 --> 0:1:58,584
They are small arms
protection inserts that


58
0:1:58,584 --> 0:2:0,319
are made of hard
ceramic materials and


59
0:2:0,319 --> 0:2:1,921
they offer additional
protection.


60
0:2:1,921 --> 0:2:4,156
It weighs whatever just
to cover their torso and


61
0:2:4,156 --> 0:2:5,958
then they have to
carry their packs.


62
0:2:5,958 --> 0:2:7,66
That's a lot of weight
to be walking around in.


63
0:2:7,66 --> 0:2:9,161
I got something in
the back of the truck


64
0:2:9,161 --> 0:2:10,262
I want to show you all.


65
0:2:10,262 --> 0:2:11,63
I want to play
around with this and


66
0:2:11,63 --> 0:2:13,299
let y'all see what
it feels like to


67
0:2:13,299 --> 0:2:15,901
have to wear one
of these things.


68
0:2:15,901 --> 0:2:19,672
I think for us to
truly understand what


69
0:2:19,672 --> 0:2:22,808
these guys have to wear
and do and put up with.


70
0:2:22,808 --> 0:2:24,143
The only thing to do
is to run a mile in the


71
0:2:24,143 --> 0:2:25,678
shoes of the
people who wear it.


72
0:2:25,678 --> 0:2:27,58
Daddy, I am gonna take
'em all around this way


73
0:2:27,58 --> 0:2:29,582
and up this hill
you get in the truck


74
0:2:29,582 --> 0:2:31,483
and you follow
us on out.


75
0:2:31,483 --> 0:2:33,752
Out that way and we are
gonna do at least a mile.


76
0:2:33,752 --> 0:2:35,221
Rog: I don't
want to do this,


77
0:2:35,221 --> 0:2:37,59
I'm no runner but
it's for the troops


78
0:2:37,59 --> 0:2:39,191
so I'll give it a try.


79
0:2:39,191 --> 0:2:43,729
Travis Taylor: Come on.


80
0:2:43,729 --> 0:2:47,32
Daddy: Hey keep it going,
doing good, doing good.


81
0:2:47,32 --> 0:2:50,35
Left, left,
left, right, left.


82
0:2:50,35 --> 0:2:51,27
Travis Taylor: You ok Rog?


83
0:2:51,27 --> 0:2:53,5
Back in high school
I couldn't out run


84
0:2:53,5 --> 0:2:55,7
Rog to save my life.


85
0:2:55,7 --> 0:2:58,978
Rog was one of the fastest
at the 800-meter run and


86
0:2:58,978 --> 0:3:0,813
I would run about
10 or 20 seconds


87
0:3:0,813 --> 0:3:2,348
behind him at least.


88
0:3:2,348 --> 0:3:4,583
Stay with it, Rog.


89
0:3:4,583 --> 0:3:7,853
Rog: I'm through running!


90
0:3:7,853 --> 0:3:10,522
Travis Taylor: And now
seeing how after only


91
0:3:10,522 --> 0:3:13,759
.4 miles he just falls over
and off the side of the


92
0:3:13,759 --> 0:3:16,362
road and he is so winded
he can't get along.


93
0:3:16,362 --> 0:3:19,265
I think he sees what his
lifestyle has done to him.


94
0:3:19,265 --> 0:3:24,87
Daddy: Get in here before
you have a heart attack.


95
0:3:24,87 --> 0:3:26,972
Michael: These suits are
heavy and they're hot and


96
0:3:26,972 --> 0:3:29,275
they're awkward to wear
and they're bulky because


97
0:3:29,275 --> 0:3:31,76
these plates are stiff so
every time you move you


98
0:3:31,76 --> 0:3:33,45
feel 'em on your
back and you can feel


99
0:3:33,45 --> 0:3:34,48
where they restrict you.


100
0:3:34,48 --> 0:3:36,81
Travis Taylor: What
we got to do is


101
0:3:36,81 --> 0:3:37,583
figure out
something better.


102
0:3:37,583 --> 0:3:39,51
They're good I mean
it's the best state of


103
0:3:39,51 --> 0:3:40,819
art armor in the world,
but it'd be great if


104
0:3:40,819 --> 0:3:44,623
we could do something
even better.


105
0:3:44,623 --> 0:3:46,859
There are dozens of
new materials and


106
0:3:46,859 --> 0:3:48,46
ultra tough
polymers out there


107
0:3:48,46 --> 0:3:50,262
that the government
hasn't tested yet.


108
0:3:50,262 --> 0:3:52,264
We could research these
materials for them.


109
0:3:52,264 --> 0:3:54,4
And we are gonna do
it lighter, faster,


110
0:3:54,4 --> 0:3:57,136
cheaper and we are gonna
do it all in one weekend.


111
0:3:57,136 --> 0:3:58,871
I like to the cut
the weight in half


112
0:3:58,871 --> 0:4:0,873
and keep the
same protection.


113
0:4:0,873 --> 0:4:2,675
Daddy: Now, I don't
know of anyone


114
0:4:2,675 --> 0:4:5,177
creating a
full armor suit.


115
0:4:5,177 --> 0:4:6,945
That's a tall order.


116
0:4:6,945 --> 0:4:8,213
Travis Taylor: We
want to make a full


117
0:4:8,213 --> 0:4:10,182
body armor suit that
covers a soldier's


118
0:4:10,182 --> 0:4:13,18
torso, arms,
legs and head.


119
0:4:13,18 --> 0:4:15,254
It's got to be bullet
proof and blast proof


120
0:4:15,254 --> 0:4:17,423
and still be light
and flexible enough to


121
0:4:17,423 --> 0:4:19,558
maneuver through
a battlefield.


122
0:4:19,558 --> 0:4:21,226
Once we figure out the
materials which you all


123
0:4:21,226 --> 0:4:22,928
need to go be gathering
up some materials and


124
0:4:22,928 --> 0:4:24,463
go do some testing but
you know got to make


125
0:4:24,463 --> 0:4:25,864
a vest out of that.


126
0:4:25,864 --> 0:4:27,499
So uh I think I'm gonna
have to go recruit some


127
0:4:27,499 --> 0:4:30,69
help on that cause don't
none of us how to sew.


128
0:4:30,69 --> 0:4:31,804
Daddy: I know as
much about sewing


129
0:4:31,804 --> 0:4:33,605
as a hog does
arithmetic.


130
0:4:33,605 --> 0:4:35,341
Travis won't do it,
Michael and Pete


131
0:4:35,341 --> 0:4:38,377
not gonna do it, Rog
sure ain't gonna do it.


132
0:4:38,377 --> 0:4:40,913
Travis Taylor:
Guess what, momma!


133
0:4:40,913 --> 0:4:42,481
Well look you all gather
up all the materials you


134
0:4:42,481 --> 0:4:44,183
can think of that
might be useful and


135
0:4:44,183 --> 0:4:46,652
I'll see if mom can break
her sewing machine out


136
0:4:46,652 --> 0:4:47,953
and help us figure
out to make a vest


137
0:4:47,953 --> 0:4:48,954
out of this thing.


138
0:4:48,954 --> 0:4:50,589
Y'all, y'all
go get with it.


139
0:4:50,589 --> 0:4:51,99
Michael: You
go get with it.


140
0:4:51,99 --> 0:4:54,259
Mama: Show me what
you got in mind.


141
0:4:54,259 --> 0:4:56,61
Travis Taylor: Well, we
are gonna make a vest.


142
0:4:56,61 --> 0:4:57,83
We're starting with
a vest the same size


143
0:4:57,83 --> 0:4:59,131
as the military vest.


144
0:4:59,131 --> 0:5:1,33
Our first challenge is
to make half the weight


145
0:5:1,33 --> 0:5:2,534
and just as
bullet proof.


146
0:5:2,534 --> 0:5:3,936
Now if we can
pull that off,


147
0:5:3,936 --> 0:5:6,605
then we'll scale it
up to a full suit.


148
0:5:6,605 --> 0:5:7,973
Rog: Get out of
the way, Yerp.


149
0:5:7,973 --> 0:5:9,441
Quit calling them gals!


150
0:5:9,441 --> 0:5:10,909
Pete: We were looking
around for materials in


151
0:5:10,909 --> 0:5:12,678
the neighborhood and we
picked up a water tank


152
0:5:12,678 --> 0:5:14,313
from the neighbors
farm it's made of


153
0:5:14,313 --> 0:5:17,816
high-density
polyethylene.


154
0:5:17,816 --> 0:5:19,818
We also found a sheet
of ultra high molecular


155
0:5:19,818 --> 0:5:21,653
weight polyethylene
which is used for


156
0:5:21,653 --> 0:5:24,556
anything from fishing
line to hip replacements.


157
0:5:24,556 --> 0:5:26,558
These should make great
body armor plates.


158
0:5:26,558 --> 0:5:28,427
And then we picked
up some Kevlar material


159
0:5:28,427 --> 0:5:29,962
from the local
surplus store for


160
0:5:29,962 --> 0:5:32,498
Mrs. Taylor to
sew the vest with.


161
0:5:32,498 --> 0:5:33,599
Travis Taylor:
Hold up a minute,


162
0:5:33,599 --> 0:5:34,933
hold up a minute,
hold up a minute.


163
0:5:34,933 --> 0:5:35,934
Hold up a minute;


164
0:5:35,934 --> 0:5:37,35
let me show you
all something.


165
0:5:37,35 --> 0:5:38,7
Michael: Show
us something.


166
0:5:38,7 --> 0:5:39,304
Rog: What do you got?


167
0:5:39,304 --> 0:5:40,739
Travis Taylor: Mom and
I have been in there


168
0:5:40,739 --> 0:5:42,374
working on a template
for what we got to have.


169
0:5:42,374 --> 0:5:44,643
This is what the vets
is gonna look like;


170
0:5:44,643 --> 0:5:47,12
these are the hard pieces
that we got to make.


171
0:5:47,12 --> 0:5:48,28
Go head and draw
it up on a piece of


172
0:5:48,28 --> 0:5:49,381
plywood or something.


173
0:5:49,381 --> 0:5:50,516
Michael: Something
to trace.


174
0:5:50,516 --> 0:5:52,84
Travis Taylor: 'Cause I
got to get these back to


175
0:5:52,84 --> 0:5:53,485
momma and get her
some fabric did you


176
0:5:53,485 --> 0:5:54,686
all find me some
Kevlar fabric yet?


177
0:5:54,686 --> 0:5:55,854
Pete: Yes.


178
0:5:55,854 --> 0:5:57,656
Michael: Yes there is some
out right over there.


179
0:5:57,656 --> 0:5:59,224
Travis Taylor:
Hey lookie here.


180
0:5:59,224 --> 0:6:1,794
Pete: The boys came up
with several things.


181
0:6:1,794 --> 0:6:4,963
The first thing is
we got this UHMWPE


182
0:6:4,963 --> 0:6:7,433
Ultra High Molecular
Weight Polyethylene.


183
0:6:7,433 --> 0:6:8,4
Travis Taylor:
Oh, yeah, yeah.


184
0:6:8,4 --> 0:6:9,802
Pete: So it's a lot
more dense it's got


185
0:6:9,802 --> 0:6:11,136
a look more
aero density.


186
0:6:11,136 --> 0:6:13,71
Travis Taylor: Yeah it's
the same polymer but


187
0:6:13,71 --> 0:6:15,541
that stuff there has
like thousands of atoms


188
0:6:15,541 --> 0:6:17,9
on the molecule chain and


189
0:6:17,9 --> 0:6:18,911
this one has like
millions right?


190
0:6:18,911 --> 0:6:21,313
Ultra high molecular
weight polyethylene


191
0:6:21,313 --> 0:6:24,16
is a polymer made up
of very long chains


192
0:6:24,16 --> 0:6:26,618
of polyethylene molecules.


193
0:6:26,618 --> 0:6:28,253
The more molecules
on the chain,


194
0:6:28,253 --> 0:6:30,322
the greater the
impact resistance.


195
0:6:30,322 --> 0:6:33,125
This stuff has a
molecular weight 15 times


196
0:6:33,125 --> 0:6:35,327
greater than
regular polyethylene


197
0:6:35,327 --> 0:6:37,663
that makes it
incredibly tough.


198
0:6:37,663 --> 0:6:41,567
Yeah this stuff should
stop a .22 cold just by itself.


199
0:6:41,567 --> 0:6:43,802
While Momma sews the
Kevlar vest together


200
0:6:43,802 --> 0:6:46,104
we cut our armor
plate pieces.


201
0:6:46,104 --> 0:6:48,14
Michael and Rog and
I were hanging out in


202
0:6:48,14 --> 0:6:49,508
the back of
the truck and


203
0:6:49,508 --> 0:6:51,41
I looked at my bed
liner on the truck.


204
0:6:51,41 --> 0:6:53,245
Look at this right here.


205
0:6:53,245 --> 0:6:56,915
And that reminded me
that Line-X is one


206
0:6:56,915 --> 0:6:58,45
of the strongest
materials that you can


207
0:6:58,45 --> 0:7:0,752
put on a bed liner
of a truck and


208
0:7:0,752 --> 0:7:2,287
you dump rocks
and all sorts of


209
0:7:2,287 --> 0:7:3,989
stuff in there and
never bothers it.


210
0:7:3,989 --> 0:7:8,193
What if we sprayed
that armor with Line-X?


211
0:7:8,193 --> 0:7:9,361
Michael: Uh
they're tough.


212
0:7:9,361 --> 0:7:11,196
Rog: Their tougher
on hobo stuff.


213
0:7:11,196 --> 0:7:12,564
Michael: It would
sure make it rugged.


214
0:7:12,564 --> 0:7:13,665
Travis Taylor: It
would make it rugged.


215
0:7:13,665 --> 0:7:15,0
Michael: You wouldn't
never tear it,


216
0:7:15,0 --> 0:7:17,336
or scratch it or it
would never come apart.


217
0:7:17,336 --> 0:7:18,67
Travis Taylor: A lot
of folks take their


218
0:7:18,67 --> 0:7:20,339
trucks to the Line-X
shop to have their


219
0:7:20,339 --> 0:7:22,574
bed sprayed for
added protection.


220
0:7:22,574 --> 0:7:25,777
Line-X is made of a
strong polyurethane plastic


221
0:7:25,777 --> 0:7:28,28
and it's so tough,
the Pentagon building


222
0:7:28,28 --> 0:7:29,882
is even got parts
sprayed with this


223
0:7:29,882 --> 0:7:32,384
stuff to protect it
from bomb blasts.


224
0:7:32,384 --> 0:7:34,86
I think a coat or
two would really help


225
0:7:34,86 --> 0:7:35,754
with our
armor protection.


226
0:7:35,754 --> 0:7:37,256
You know Momma is
about done with that


227
0:7:37,256 --> 0:7:38,924
vest in there, I
am gonna go get it


228
0:7:38,924 --> 0:7:40,125
and get it sprayed.


229
0:7:40,125 --> 0:7:41,26
Rog: Shot gun.


230
0:7:41,26 --> 0:7:41,927
Michael: Road trip.


231
0:7:41,927 --> 0:7:44,96
Travis Taylor: No,
no, no you two get


232
0:7:44,96 --> 0:7:45,531
back in there and
you all, you all stay


233
0:7:45,531 --> 0:7:47,332
and work on that armor.


234
0:7:47,332 --> 0:7:48,534
Michael: Let's go.


235
0:7:48,534 --> 0:7:49,801
Travis Taylor: And the
helmet and all that.


236
0:7:49,801 --> 0:7:51,169
I am gonna
take Pete over.


237
0:7:51,169 --> 0:7:52,538
It's about time
that me and


238
0:7:52,538 --> 0:7:54,106
Pete got to go
on a road trip.


239
0:7:54,106 --> 0:7:55,841
We grabbed the vest
that Momma sewed all


240
0:7:55,841 --> 0:7:57,376
the armor
plates into and


241
0:7:57,376 --> 0:8:0,746
we took it over
to get it sprayed.


242
0:8:0,746 --> 0:8:2,347
Safety glasses Pete.


243
0:8:2,347 --> 0:8:4,49
Pete: I'm suprised he
has any buckets left.


244
0:8:4,49 --> 0:8:5,751
Travis Taylor: Check
that out, look at that.


245
0:8:5,751 --> 0:8:7,452
Pete: It get's pulled right
to those vents over there?


246
0:8:7,452 --> 0:8:9,21
Travis Taylor:
Oh yeah, oh yeah,


247
0:8:9,21 --> 0:8:10,122
that's beautiful man.


248
0:8:10,122 --> 0:8:11,29
I think we're done.


249
0:8:11,29 --> 0:8:12,824
As soon as it cools
off enough we can pick it up,


250
0:8:12,824 --> 0:8:14,459
we'll pick it up and
we'll throw it in the truck.


251
0:8:14,459 --> 0:8:17,93
We'll shoot
it, blow it up.


252
0:8:17,93 --> 0:8:19,698
Now it's time
for our big test.


253
0:8:19,698 --> 0:8:21,733
Will this lighter vest
hold up to combat


254
0:8:21,733 --> 0:8:24,736
conditions as well as
the standard issue vest?


255
0:8:24,736 --> 0:8:26,438
We had the guys meet
us at the gun range


256
0:8:26,438 --> 0:8:28,106
along with a
buddy of ours.


257
0:8:28,106 --> 0:8:29,975
And Daddy you got
your 9-millimeter


258
0:8:29,975 --> 0:8:31,43
and what else?


259
0:8:31,43 --> 0:8:32,411
Daddy: I got it.


260
0:8:32,411 --> 0:8:34,112
Travis Taylor: Look
here, look here.


261
0:8:34,112 --> 0:8:36,515
A buddy of ours, Soupy,
came up he's a vet;


262
0:8:36,515 --> 0:8:39,651
he actually wore these
things over in Iraq.


263
0:8:39,651 --> 0:8:42,87
I wanted you to take a
look at what we did and


264
0:8:42,87 --> 0:8:43,789
maybe give us some
pointers on it and


265
0:8:43,789 --> 0:8:45,324
tell us whatever,
this is our prototype


266
0:8:45,324 --> 0:8:46,525
we are about
to blow it up,


267
0:8:46,525 --> 0:8:48,527
shoot at it do whatever
we come up with.


268
0:8:48,527 --> 0:8:52,664
But I wanted you to see
what you think about it.


269
0:8:52,664 --> 0:8:54,99
Soupy: Man, I'll
tell you that,


270
0:8:54,99 --> 0:8:55,867
that's a whole
lot lighter than


271
0:8:55,867 --> 0:8:57,469
what we actually wore.


272
0:8:57,469 --> 0:8:58,337
Travis Taylor: Yeah?


273
0:8:58,337 --> 0:8:59,771
Soupy: Yes, sir.


274
0:8:59,771 --> 0:9:2,574
The main thing is
the flexibility.


275
0:9:2,574 --> 0:9:4,109
Travis Taylor: We're
gonna work on that a


276
0:9:4,109 --> 0:9:6,144
little bit more too
but this is the basis


277
0:9:6,144 --> 0:9:7,613
of what the
material would be.


278
0:9:7,613 --> 0:9:9,815
So we wanted to use this
as the one we shoot.


279
0:9:9,815 --> 0:9:10,949
Soupy: All right.


280
0:9:10,949 --> 0:9:12,84
Travis Taylor:
Well Michael,


281
0:9:12,84 --> 0:9:13,251
let's go throw this
thing on that dummy.


282
0:9:13,251 --> 0:9:14,186
You all get
the guns ready.


283
0:9:14,186 --> 0:9:15,287
Daddy: I'm ready.


284
0:9:15,287 --> 0:9:16,521
Travis Taylor:
We in good shape,


285
0:9:16,521 --> 0:9:18,89
move his arms down so
Pete can shoot them off.


286
0:9:18,89 --> 0:9:20,292
Rog: He's got pretty
eyes don't he?


287
0:9:20,292 --> 0:9:22,227
Travis Taylor: I'm scared
to look into them.


288
0:9:22,227 --> 0:9:23,996
First Pete gave them
the same treatment


289
0:9:23,996 --> 0:9:29,601
with his AK-47 that we
gave the standard vest.


290
0:9:29,601 --> 0:9:32,571
Then it was Daddy's turn
with his 9 millimeter.


291
0:9:32,571 --> 0:9:34,72
Daddy?


292
0:9:34,72 --> 0:9:35,4
Daddy: Yes son?


293
0:9:35,4 --> 0:9:36,742
Travis Taylor: I hate
to ask but do you


294
0:9:36,742 --> 0:9:38,243
think you can hit
that thing from here


295
0:9:38,243 --> 0:9:39,544
with your 9 millimeter?


296
0:9:39,544 --> 0:9:40,679
Daddy: We'll
try it and see.


297
0:9:40,679 --> 0:9:41,98
Travis Taylor: See
what you can do.


298
0:9:41,98 --> 0:9:43,415
Daddy: All right, ready?


299
0:9:43,415 --> 0:9:50,722
Going hot.


300
0:9:50,722 --> 0:9:51,69
That's it.


301
0:9:51,69 --> 0:9:53,158
Travis Taylor:
Well let's go look.


302
0:9:53,158 --> 0:9:55,327
Rog: Yeah.


303
0:9:55,327 --> 0:9:56,695
Travis Taylor: Well
it looks like you


304
0:9:56,695 --> 0:9:58,3
shot right through
his hand right there.


305
0:9:58,3 --> 0:9:59,64
Daddy: Yeah.


306
0:9:59,64 --> 0:10:0,365
Travis Taylor: Look it
went in right there.


307
0:10:0,365 --> 0:10:1,566
The question is
did it come on


308
0:10:1,566 --> 0:10:2,601
out the other side?


309
0:10:2,601 --> 0:10:3,735
I can get
right here and


310
0:10:3,735 --> 0:10:5,103
I can see if he
got this one.


311
0:10:5,103 --> 0:10:6,204
Try to feel the
bullet caught in;


312
0:10:6,204 --> 0:10:7,572
right there I got
the bullet in my hand


313
0:10:7,572 --> 0:10:8,94
it's caught
in the Kevlar.


314
0:10:8,94 --> 0:10:10,575
The plates stopped
the bullets but there


315
0:10:10,575 --> 0:10:12,377
is a serious
design flaw.


316
0:10:12,377 --> 0:10:13,945
The bullets went
through the seams


317
0:10:13,945 --> 0:10:15,47
between the
armor plates.


318
0:10:15,47 --> 0:10:16,81
We got to
figure that out.


319
0:10:16,81 --> 0:10:17,749
I say we raise
it up a notch.


320
0:10:17,749 --> 0:10:19,284
Now we know that
the methods and


321
0:10:19,284 --> 0:10:21,219
materials we used
on this first vest


322
0:10:21,219 --> 0:10:23,288
can stop bullets,
which is great,


323
0:10:23,288 --> 0:10:25,691
but can it
stop an IED?


324
0:10:25,691 --> 0:10:28,93
I rigged us up an
IED this could be


325
0:10:28,93 --> 0:10:31,263
loud so be prepared,
are we ready?


326
0:10:31,263 --> 0:10:33,165
3, 2, 1.


327
0:10:33,165 --> 0:10:38,36
<i> [explosion]</i>


328
0:10:38,36 --> 0:10:39,504
Travis Taylor: We've been
creating lightweight


329
0:10:39,504 --> 0:10:42,741
flexible body armor for
soldiers to use in combat.


330
0:10:42,741 --> 0:10:44,242
We already proved
that our armored


331
0:10:44,242 --> 0:10:46,378
vest stops bullets.


332
0:10:46,378 --> 0:10:48,18
Now we are
gonna see if it can


333
0:10:48,18 --> 0:10:49,948
stand up to explosives.


334
0:10:49,948 --> 0:10:52,217
This could be loud
so be prepared.


335
0:10:52,217 --> 0:10:53,251
Pete: All right.


336
0:10:53,251 --> 0:10:54,486
Travis Taylor: Let's
see how we do against


337
0:10:54,486 --> 0:10:57,456
an IED, are we ready?


338
0:10:57,456 --> 0:11:1,96
3, 2, 1.


339
0:11:1,96 --> 0:11:8,133
<i> [explosion]</i>


340
0:11:8,133 --> 0:11:10,602
Pete: Whoo!


341
0:11:10,602 --> 0:11:13,305
Michael: What happened?


342
0:11:13,305 --> 0:11:14,773
Travis Taylor: Just
look at this thing.


343
0:11:14,773 --> 0:11:16,374
Michael: Let's
go check him out.


344
0:11:16,374 --> 0:11:19,311
Daddy: Man, there is
his poor old leg.


345
0:11:19,311 --> 0:11:21,179
I'll tell you, doin' a
test like this makes you


346
0:11:21,179 --> 0:11:25,183
think about what our
soldiers have to deal with.


347
0:11:25,183 --> 0:11:26,585
Travis Taylor: Look
at this it didn't


348
0:11:26,585 --> 0:11:27,686
bother him up here.


349
0:11:27,686 --> 0:11:28,82
Michael: No.


350
0:11:28,82 --> 0:11:30,155
Travis Taylor: Didn't
bother him at all up here.


351
0:11:30,155 --> 0:11:31,89
Soupy: But that proves
that you know we still


352
0:11:31,89 --> 0:11:33,325
need something on
the lower torso.


353
0:11:33,325 --> 0:11:35,16
Travis Taylor: Yeah
that's right man.


354
0:11:35,16 --> 0:11:37,629
Soupy: I mean you can
see what an IED does.


355
0:11:37,629 --> 0:11:38,597
Travis Taylor:
Yeah it blows,


356
0:11:38,597 --> 0:11:39,831
that's why we have
so many guys with


357
0:11:39,831 --> 0:11:41,366
their legs blown
off right now.


358
0:11:41,366 --> 0:11:42,567
Soupy: Exactly.


359
0:11:42,567 --> 0:11:44,336
Travis Taylor: We got
to make some armor that


360
0:11:44,336 --> 0:11:46,37
will do just
that for the legs.


361
0:11:46,37 --> 0:11:47,706
This test was a success;


362
0:11:47,706 --> 0:11:50,208
we made a bullet proof,
bombproof vest that's


363
0:11:50,208 --> 0:11:53,211
less than half the weight
of the standard vest.


364
0:11:53,211 --> 0:11:55,914
The challenge here is
to find a way to protect


365
0:11:55,914 --> 0:11:58,784
the limbs while
maintaining flexibility


366
0:11:58,784 --> 0:12:0,519
and mobility
in a full suit.


367
0:12:0,519 --> 0:12:2,22
We need to get back
to the garage and


368
0:12:2,22 --> 0:12:3,622
make this thing
so it will protect


369
0:12:3,622 --> 0:12:5,657
not just the torso,
but also the legs.


370
0:12:5,657 --> 0:12:9,828
Poor old mannequin.


371
0:12:9,828 --> 0:12:12,397
So I went and recruited
my mom some help.


372
0:12:12,397 --> 0:12:13,999
I got some my
students from some my


373
0:12:13,999 --> 0:12:16,201
classes over at the
local university to


374
0:12:16,201 --> 0:12:17,869
come over and
help her out.


375
0:12:17,869 --> 0:12:19,4
Look at this
right here,


376
0:12:19,4 --> 0:12:20,205
there's a
bullet in there.


377
0:12:20,205 --> 0:12:21,239
Mama: Oh wow.


378
0:12:21,239 --> 0:12:22,674
Travis Taylor: It
caught it just fine


379
0:12:22,674 --> 0:12:23,742
and it worked well.


380
0:12:23,742 --> 0:12:25,177
The interesting thing
that we learned though


381
0:12:25,177 --> 0:12:27,546
mom is look here,
these bullets came


382
0:12:27,546 --> 0:12:29,8
out in a straight line


383
0:12:29,8 --> 0:12:30,382
and that there is
where the seam is.


384
0:12:30,382 --> 0:12:31,817
Mama: That's where
the seams are.


385
0:12:31,817 --> 0:12:33,451
Travis Taylor: So we are
gonna have to figure out


386
0:12:33,451 --> 0:12:35,353
a way to overlap
that armor in there


387
0:12:35,353 --> 0:12:36,922
so that they wont
come out on the seams.


388
0:12:36,922 --> 0:12:38,39
Maybe where they
overlap more like


389
0:12:38,39 --> 0:12:40,759
fish scale or lizard
scales or something.


390
0:12:40,759 --> 0:12:43,595
Hey, hey, look here!


391
0:12:43,595 --> 0:12:45,13
Rog: Whatcha got?


392
0:12:45,13 --> 0:12:46,898
Travis Taylor: Well I have
been talking with mom and


393
0:12:46,898 --> 0:12:49,1
been thinking about how
we wore this we are gonna


394
0:12:49,1 --> 0:12:52,103
have to do these pieces
smaller and Line-X the


395
0:12:52,103 --> 0:12:54,239
individual pieces and then
put them on the inside of


396
0:12:54,239 --> 0:12:56,141
the armor in order
for it to be where


397
0:12:56,141 --> 0:12:57,342
I can move around in it.


398
0:12:57,342 --> 0:12:59,611
That's gonna be the key
in stopping fragments


399
0:12:59,611 --> 0:13:1,88
and bullets and
making it more mobile.


400
0:13:1,88 --> 0:13:13,892
Let's work on that.


401
0:13:13,892 --> 0:13:15,26
The suit is one thing,


402
0:13:15,26 --> 0:13:16,595
but what about
head protection?


403
0:13:16,595 --> 0:13:18,463
The American military
has been making helmets


404
0:13:18,463 --> 0:13:20,565
for a hundred years,
but we want to make one


405
0:13:20,565 --> 0:13:22,901
with full-face protection.


406
0:13:22,901 --> 0:13:25,36
We used the design of
a motorcycle helmet to


407
0:13:25,36 --> 0:13:26,638
protect more
of the face.


408
0:13:26,638 --> 0:13:28,773
We added some foam pieces
to make up the basic


409
0:13:28,773 --> 0:13:31,476
structure and then
covered it all in Kevlar.


410
0:13:31,476 --> 0:13:35,247
And then we held it all
together with fiberglass.


411
0:13:35,247 --> 0:13:36,514
Michael: I am gonna
wash my hands so they


412
0:13:36,514 --> 0:13:37,916
don't like smell
like these nasty gloves.


413
0:13:37,916 --> 0:13:39,17
Smell my fingers, Rog.


414
0:13:39,17 --> 0:13:40,652
Rog: Nope, nope.


415
0:13:40,652 --> 0:13:42,254
Travis Taylor: We
got plenty more to do


416
0:13:42,254 --> 0:13:43,288
lets get on the next one.


417
0:13:43,288 --> 0:13:44,723
Pete: Heard that.


418
0:13:44,723 --> 0:13:46,224
Travis Taylor: Things
are moving along.


419
0:13:46,224 --> 0:13:47,726
Momma and her student
helpers Chris and


420
0:13:47,726 --> 0:13:49,928
Katie spent all
day cutting and


421
0:13:49,928 --> 0:13:54,232
sewing on that
yellow Kevlar fabric.


422
0:13:54,232 --> 0:13:57,35
Mama: And that will
make, easy to make


423
0:13:57,35 --> 0:13:59,638
strips of pockets and
then we do another layer


424
0:13:59,638 --> 0:14:1,139
and come back over here.


425
0:14:1,139 --> 0:14:2,207
Travis Taylor: Then
they sewed them into


426
0:14:2,207 --> 0:14:4,976
pocket packs that fit
perfectly in the vest.


427
0:14:4,976 --> 0:14:7,78
I decided that we needed
to add armor plates


428
0:14:7,78 --> 0:14:8,513
to the outside
of the legs and


429
0:14:8,513 --> 0:14:11,85
arms just like a
catcher's shin guard.


430
0:14:11,85 --> 0:14:15,22
That's gonna have
to be tightened up.


431
0:14:15,22 --> 0:14:17,222
So these, I need
to put a strap on it


432
0:14:17,222 --> 0:14:18,423
for me Michael.


433
0:14:18,423 --> 0:14:21,359
Just maybe uh cut 'em,
drill out a slot.


434
0:14:21,359 --> 0:14:22,794
Michael: Use a
Velcro strap yeah.


435
0:14:22,794 --> 0:14:24,95
Travis Taylor: Yeah ok.


436
0:14:24,95 --> 0:14:26,231
This time around we
only sprayed the


437
0:14:26,231 --> 0:14:28,133
armor plates
with the Line-X


438
0:14:28,133 --> 0:14:30,335
to make the whole
suit more flexible.


439
0:14:30,335 --> 0:14:32,103
Mama: The last
step is cover all


440
0:14:32,103 --> 0:14:34,372
that itchy Kevlar
with cotton fabric.


441
0:14:34,372 --> 0:14:38,243
I hope Travis likes orange
cause that's all I got.


442
0:14:38,243 --> 0:14:39,711
Travis Taylor: We've
got to finish these


443
0:14:39,711 --> 0:14:40,979
exterior armor plates,


444
0:14:40,979 --> 0:14:44,549
which means dinner
in the garage again.


445
0:14:44,549 --> 0:14:50,355
Tomorrow we do a full
mobility test on the suit.


446
0:14:50,355 --> 0:14:51,756
Everybody worked
really hard.


447
0:14:51,756 --> 0:14:54,559
Mom and students worked
their butts off;


448
0:14:54,559 --> 0:14:56,61
we worked really
hard cutting all the


449
0:14:56,61 --> 0:14:59,931
plates up getting
everything all together.


450
0:14:59,931 --> 0:15:2,233
Here's the suit.


451
0:15:2,233 --> 0:15:3,802
Rog: Tear it up, Mule.


452
0:15:3,802 --> 0:15:5,437
Travis Taylor:
All this is Kevlar.


453
0:15:5,437 --> 0:15:8,406
The inner shirt and
the vest with the


454
0:15:8,406 --> 0:15:11,609
armor plates in it,
it's ready to go;


455
0:15:11,609 --> 0:15:15,613
total weight, 39 lbs.


456
0:15:15,613 --> 0:15:17,582
Rog: That thing looks
like bulky as hell.


457
0:15:17,582 --> 0:15:19,15
He ain't gonna be
able to even move in


458
0:15:19,15 --> 0:15:20,485
that thing much
less run across


459
0:15:20,485 --> 0:15:23,455
a battlefield
getting shot at.


460
0:15:23,455 --> 0:15:24,923
Travis Taylor: This
thing might look kind


461
0:15:24,923 --> 0:15:26,324
of goofy in
prototype stage,


462
0:15:26,324 --> 0:15:28,59
but the concept is
what's important.


463
0:15:28,59 --> 0:15:29,828
It's got to save lives.


464
0:15:29,828 --> 0:15:31,596
So I decided the
best place to test a


465
0:15:31,596 --> 0:15:37,469
military armor suit was
the local playground.


466
0:15:37,469 --> 0:15:39,637
Man, I believe its
getting warm up in here.


467
0:15:39,637 --> 0:15:40,839
Michael: Yeah,
it's getting hot.


468
0:15:40,839 --> 0:15:42,24
Travis Taylor: A
kid's playground is a


469
0:15:42,24 --> 0:15:43,608
great place for
a mobility test.


470
0:15:43,608 --> 0:15:45,31
It's got a
challenging terrain,


471
0:15:45,31 --> 0:15:50,448
sand and lots of
obstacles to get through.


472
0:15:50,448 --> 0:15:52,617
Michael: Really,
a playground?


473
0:15:52,617 --> 0:15:54,252
Uncle Travis
doesn't know it yet,


474
0:15:54,252 --> 0:15:55,754
but after this I'm
gonna set him with


475
0:15:55,754 --> 0:16:0,558
something a little
more challenging.


476
0:16:0,558 --> 0:16:2,36
Daddy: This playground
test is simple.


477
0:16:2,36 --> 0:16:4,29
Can Travis move
enough in this thing


478
0:16:4,29 --> 0:16:6,631
to get through every
obstacle without stopping?


479
0:16:6,631 --> 0:16:8,133
On 3, you ready?


480
0:16:8,133 --> 0:16:8,933
Travis Taylor: Mm-hmm.


481
0:16:8,933 --> 0:16:10,535
Daddy: 3, 2, 1.


482
0:16:10,535 --> 0:16:12,504
Travis Taylor: Wait a
minute you just said 3.


483
0:16:12,504 --> 0:16:13,638
Rog: You should have went.


484
0:16:13,638 --> 0:16:15,173
Michel: Go.


485
0:16:15,173 --> 0:16:18,576
Rog: Watch them kids.


486
0:16:18,576 --> 0:16:20,945
Daddy: It was just like
the pied piper every kid


487
0:16:20,945 --> 0:16:23,548
on that playground
got right behind him and


488
0:16:23,548 --> 0:16:26,251
tried to emulate
what he was doing,


489
0:16:26,251 --> 0:16:29,32
it was funny.


490
0:16:29,32 --> 0:16:30,889
Rog: Stay with it, Mule.


491
0:16:30,889 --> 0:16:32,157
Travis Taylor: Turns
out it's not so easy


492
0:16:32,157 --> 0:16:40,899
to do monkey bars
in an armor suit.


493
0:16:40,899 --> 0:16:43,34
Pete: Come on, technique.


494
0:16:43,34 --> 0:16:44,969
Travis: [sighs].


495
0:16:44,969 --> 0:16:47,5
Rog: How bad
is it, Mule?


496
0:16:47,5 --> 0:16:48,506
Travis Taylor: That
was a lot harder than


497
0:16:48,506 --> 0:16:51,543
I thought but this
proves the suit works


498
0:16:51,543 --> 0:16:52,944
and it's flexible
enough to tackle


499
0:16:52,944 --> 0:16:54,412
anything on
this playground.


500
0:16:54,412 --> 0:16:56,347
And uh Michael must have
thought that was silly.


501
0:16:56,347 --> 0:16:57,615
Michael: How are
we gonna test anything


502
0:16:57,615 --> 0:16:59,818
to military specs
on a playground?


503
0:16:59,818 --> 0:17:1,152
You know if he was
running through this


504
0:17:1,152 --> 0:17:2,554
and being chased by
a bunch of 7 year old


505
0:17:2,554 --> 0:17:4,55
kids that's not
gonna get it;


506
0:17:4,55 --> 0:17:6,491
that shows you right there
that is not gonna get it.


507
0:17:6,491 --> 0:17:7,959
So I call in my
buddy Bodette who


508
0:17:7,959 --> 0:17:9,6
is a retired Marine.


509
0:17:9,6 --> 0:17:10,361
He is gonna put
Uncle Travis through


510
0:17:10,361 --> 0:17:15,133
a real training course.


511
0:17:15,133 --> 0:17:16,501
Travis Taylor: He
walks like a Marine.


512
0:17:16,501 --> 0:17:17,702
Michael: Yeah he does.


513
0:17:17,702 --> 0:17:19,504
Bodette: Hey uh,
explain something to


514
0:17:19,504 --> 0:17:21,72
me real quick you
really think that


515
0:17:21,72 --> 0:17:22,307
playing on
a little kiddie


516
0:17:22,307 --> 0:17:23,908
playground is gonna
simulate you in anyway


517
0:17:23,908 --> 0:17:26,277
shape or form in any type
of combat situation?


518
0:17:26,277 --> 0:17:27,345
Travis Taylor: Uh.


519
0:17:27,345 --> 0:17:28,746
Bodette: Absolutely not,
it ain't gonna happen!


520
0:17:28,746 --> 0:17:31,983
The playground was stupid.


521
0:17:31,983 --> 0:17:33,718
Well I got news for you
if you cannot shoot,


522
0:17:33,718 --> 0:17:35,253
move and communicate
wearing that it's


523
0:17:35,253 --> 0:17:36,387
absolutely
useless to me.


524
0:17:36,387 --> 0:17:38,22
I got a real
test for you.


525
0:17:38,22 --> 0:17:39,757
Michael: Its funny
to me to get ready to


526
0:17:39,757 --> 0:17:46,998
see what old Bodette is
gonna put him through.


527
0:17:46,998 --> 0:17:49,367
Travis Taylor: We're
making a lightweight armor suit


528
0:17:49,367 --> 0:17:51,769
and a retired Marine
Corps Drill Instructor


529
0:17:51,769 --> 0:17:53,438
is gonna put me
through the ringer.


530
0:17:53,438 --> 0:17:55,6
Bodette: What we are gonna
do here today gentlemen,


531
0:17:55,6 --> 0:17:56,608
is I am gonna put
Travis through a


532
0:17:56,608 --> 0:17:59,177
civilian version of
a combat fitness test.


533
0:17:59,177 --> 0:18:1,779
It's simulating him
being able to overcome


534
0:18:1,779 --> 0:18:4,15
obstacles in a
combat situation


535
0:18:4,15 --> 0:18:5,416
while wearing his gear.


536
0:18:5,416 --> 0:18:6,751
Daddy: I am thinking
now this is gonna be


537
0:18:6,751 --> 0:18:8,72
tough on Travis you know.


538
0:18:8,72 --> 0:18:10,188
Bodette: I need you
Michael to go over there


539
0:18:10,188 --> 0:18:11,422
and put that flight
jacket on and lay down.


540
0:18:11,422 --> 0:18:12,49
Michael: All right.


541
0:18:12,49 --> 0:18:13,591
Bodette: You're gonna
be a wounded warrior.


542
0:18:13,591 --> 0:18:14,526
Michael: All right.


543
0:18:14,526 --> 0:18:15,527
Bodette: You go
do that right now we


544
0:18:15,527 --> 0:18:16,561
are getting
ready to start.


545
0:18:16,561 --> 0:18:18,163
Any type of protective
gear that you wear


546
0:18:18,163 --> 0:18:19,898
you cannot really
give up mobility.


547
0:18:19,898 --> 0:18:21,799
If you can't shoot, move
and communicate with the


548
0:18:21,799 --> 0:18:24,369
body armor then it's
absolutely useless.


549
0:18:24,369 --> 0:18:25,37
Are you ready?


550
0:18:25,37 --> 0:18:26,471
Travis Taylor: Ready
as I'll ever be.


551
0:18:26,471 --> 0:18:27,906
Bodette: Go!


552
0:18:27,906 --> 0:18:29,507
Pete: Come on, Travis.


553
0:18:29,507 --> 0:18:31,9
Bodette: All right,
Travis, drop right now.


554
0:18:31,9 --> 0:18:32,1
Drop right now and
right now give me


555
0:18:32,1 --> 0:18:32,944
5 push ups hurry up!


556
0:18:32,944 --> 0:18:34,312
1, 2!


557
0:18:34,312 --> 0:18:35,813
Travis Taylor: When
Bodette said go,


558
0:18:35,813 --> 0:18:38,416
I thought I was just
simply running over to


559
0:18:38,416 --> 0:18:39,817
a log to cross it but
somewhere in the middle


560
0:18:39,817 --> 0:18:41,986
he stopped me and had me
do a bunch of push ups.


561
0:18:41,986 --> 0:18:42,787
Bodette: 5.


562
0:18:42,787 --> 0:18:43,688
Get up, hurry up,
hurry, get up.


563
0:18:43,688 --> 0:18:44,622
Rog: Get up, mule!


564
0:18:44,622 --> 0:18:45,99
Bodette: Hurry up,
come on we ain't got


565
0:18:45,99 --> 0:18:47,91
all day now hurry up.


566
0:18:47,91 --> 0:18:48,59
Rog: This sucks.


567
0:18:48,59 --> 0:18:49,227
I am glad I ain't
doing that crap.


568
0:18:49,227 --> 0:18:51,196
Bodette: Go, go, go!


569
0:18:51,196 --> 0:18:52,363
Rog: Go mule!


570
0:18:52,363 --> 0:18:53,665
Michel: Look at him go.


571
0:18:53,665 --> 0:18:55,66
Travis Taylor: By then
I was getting winded


572
0:18:55,66 --> 0:18:56,401
and then we come
to these wires that


573
0:18:56,401 --> 0:18:57,936
I had to balance across.


574
0:18:57,936 --> 0:18:58,836
Bodette: You ain't
have all day;


575
0:18:58,836 --> 0:19:0,104
people are shooting
at you right now.


576
0:19:0,104 --> 0:19:1,739
People are depending on
you, you got to move,


577
0:19:1,739 --> 0:19:3,208
you got to move,
you ain't got time.


578
0:19:3,208 --> 0:19:5,91
Keep going, keep going!


579
0:19:5,91 --> 0:19:7,378
Your buddies need
you right now.


580
0:19:7,378 --> 0:19:9,414
They're depending
on you right now!


581
0:19:9,414 --> 0:19:10,748
You need to
hurry up, go!


582
0:19:10,748 --> 0:19:12,15
That's it.


583
0:19:12,15 --> 0:19:13,284
Rog: Arch your back.


584
0:19:13,284 --> 0:19:14,452
Bodette: Grab that rope.


585
0:19:14,452 --> 0:19:18,56
I ain't grabbing
it for ya!


586
0:19:18,56 --> 0:19:21,359
Rog: He ain't never
gonna make it.


587
0:19:21,359 --> 0:19:22,327
Bodette: Grab it.


588
0:19:22,327 --> 0:19:23,995
That's right, that's
right good job.


589
0:19:23,995 --> 0:19:25,196
Rog: Stay with it mule.


590
0:19:25,196 --> 0:19:26,297
Bodette: Come

591
0:19:26,297 --> 0:19:27,465
you got people
shooting at you.


592
0:19:27,465 --> 0:19:28,666
You ain't got time to
be tired right now.


593
0:19:28,666 --> 0:19:29,867
Go ahead and grab
that log right there,


594
0:19:29,867 --> 0:19:31,135
press it above
your head 5 times.


595
0:19:31,135 --> 0:19:32,87
Travis Taylor: Then I
had to pick up a log,


596
0:19:32,87 --> 0:19:34,272
I wasn't expecting that.


597
0:19:34,272 --> 0:19:38,176
Bodette: 1, keep
going, 2, 3.


598
0:19:38,176 --> 0:19:39,11
Pete: Yeah!


599
0:19:39,11 --> 0:19:40,278
Bodette: 4, 5, good job,


600
0:19:40,278 --> 0:19:41,346
put 'em down now
go over there.


601
0:19:41,346 --> 0:19:42,38
Get over there and
run over there.


602
0:19:42,38 --> 0:19:43,581
Now let's go Travis,


603
0:19:43,581 --> 0:19:45,216
you are gonna jump
over all these tables.


604
0:19:45,216 --> 0:19:46,251
Travis Taylor: Ahh!


605
0:19:46,251 --> 0:19:47,452
Bodette: Jump over 'em.


606
0:19:47,452 --> 0:19:48,987
Travis Taylor: I had to go
and jump over these tables


607
0:19:48,987 --> 0:19:50,688
and I was getting really
winded at that point.


608
0:19:50,688 --> 0:19:51,956
Bodette: There's gonna
be a lot of obstacles


609
0:19:51,956 --> 0:19:53,458
in combat you are gonna
have a lot of gear on you,


610
0:19:53,458 --> 0:19:54,692
people are
depending on you.


611
0:19:54,692 --> 0:19:55,593
You can do this.


612
0:19:55,593 --> 0:19:56,661
That's right.


613
0:19:56,661 --> 0:19:57,695
Keep going, keep going.


614
0:19:57,695 --> 0:19:58,997
Rog: Go, mule.


615
0:19:58,997 --> 0:20:0,64
Bodette: Keep going.


616
0:20:0,64 --> 0:20:0,999
Go over here, here just

617
0:20:0,999 --> 0:20:2,4

618
0:20:2,4 --> 0:20:3,835
You got to be low,

You got a low crawl

620
0:20:5,436 --> 0:20:6,604

622
0:20:8,539 --> 0:20:9,974

You got to hurry

627
0:20:15,446 --> 0:20:16,281
Rog: Go mule.


628
0:20:16,281 --> 0:20:17,448
Bodette: Fire, go get it.


629
0:20:17,448 --> 0:20:18,616
Pete: Stay low, brother.


630
0:20:18,616 --> 0:20:19,717
Bodette: We
ain't got time;


631
0:20:19,717 --> 0:20:20,618
you ain't got
time to be tired.


632
0:20:20,618 --> 0:20:21,619
Rog: Stay with it, mule.


633
0:20:21,619 --> 0:20:22,787
Bodette: Let's go,

Get on those

637
0:20:26,324 --> 0:20:27,725
Daddy: But he made it
through that thing.


638
0:20:27,725 --> 0:20:28,726
Bodette: This
ain't nothin'.


639
0:20:28,726 --> 0:20:30,662
This ain't nothin'
your buddies need you.


640
0:20:30,662 --> 0:20:31,763
Pete: Come on buddy.


641
0:20:31,763 --> 0:20:33,464
Bodette: Your buddies
need you right now.


642
0:20:33,464 --> 0:20:36,501
Yup, just like that,
just like that.


643
0:20:36,501 --> 0:20:37,835
Travis Taylor: And then
run through a bunch of


644
0:20:37,835 --> 0:20:39,337
tires that was the
hardest part the tires


645
0:20:39,337 --> 0:20:41,606
cause I was
already dead.


646
0:20:41,606 --> 0:20:42,607
Rog: Oh, man.


647
0:20:42,607 --> 0:20:43,975
Bodette: Just like
that, just like that,


648
0:20:43,975 --> 0:20:45,76
just like that.


649
0:20:45,76 --> 0:20:46,344
Let's go!


650
0:20:46,344 --> 0:20:47,345
That's all right.


651
0:20:47,345 --> 0:20:48,846
Let's go, let's go!


652
0:20:48,846 --> 0:20:50,248
Right now people are
shooting at you.


653
0:20:50,248 --> 0:20:51,716
You got buddy he is
laying down right over


654
0:20:51,716 --> 0:20:53,318
he's got a 762
round right in


655
0:20:53,318 --> 0:20:54,752
his chest let's go.


656
0:20:54,752 --> 0:20:58,623
Hurry up, go
pick him up!


657
0:20:58,623 --> 0:20:59,791
This ain't nothin,
this ain't nothin'.


658
0:20:59,791 --> 0:21:1,192
Rog: Stay with it.


659
0:21:1,192 --> 0:21:2,927
Travis Taylor: Then
at the end of all that


660
0:21:2,927 --> 0:21:4,696
he's got Michael
laying over there as


661
0:21:4,696 --> 0:21:6,197
a wounded warrior
and I had to


662
0:21:6,197 --> 0:21:8,499
drag him probably
20 or 30 feet.


663
0:21:8,499 --> 0:21:9,434
Bodette: Let's go!


664
0:21:9,434 --> 0:21:10,301
Rog: Get him, mule.


665
0:21:10,301 --> 0:21:11,402
Pull him, mule!


666
0:21:11,402 --> 0:21:12,403
Bodette: Little
bit farther,


667
0:21:12,403 --> 0:21:13,738
little bit farther,
little bit farther,


668
0:21:13,738 --> 0:21:14,972
little bit
farther, hurry up!


669
0:21:14,972 --> 0:21:15,94
Rog: Bring him on home.


670
0:21:15,94 --> 0:21:16,974
Bodette: There you
go, there you go!


671
0:21:16,974 --> 0:21:17,842
All right, you're done.


672
0:21:17,842 --> 0:21:18,943
Good job.


673
0:21:18,943 --> 0:21:20,812
Rog: Come on, bubba.


674
0:21:20,812 --> 0:21:21,913
Bodette: Good job.


675
0:21:21,913 --> 0:21:23,81
Pete: All right,
man, all right.


676
0:21:23,81 --> 0:21:24,48
Rog: Good job, bubba.


677
0:21:24,48 --> 0:21:24,949
You need some air.


678
0:21:24,949 --> 0:21:26,517
Put them arms up,
get them arms up.


679
0:21:26,517 --> 0:21:27,752
Travis Taylor: And
at that point I was


680
0:21:27,752 --> 0:21:28,853
just ready to throw up.


681
0:21:28,853 --> 0:21:29,954
Michael: Uncle Travis
did pretty good that


682
0:21:29,954 --> 0:21:30,988
was a tough
obstacle course and


683
0:21:30,988 --> 0:21:32,957
Bodette didn't take
it easy on him.


684
0:21:32,957 --> 0:21:33,958
Travis Taylor:
Take my helmet off.


685
0:21:33,958 --> 0:21:35,727
Pete: Take
your helmet off?


686
0:21:35,727 --> 0:21:36,694
Bodette: Let me
tell you something.


687
0:21:36,694 --> 0:21:38,129
That was a great job.


688
0:21:38,129 --> 0:21:40,365
One of the things that,
that either makes you or


689
0:21:40,365 --> 0:21:42,934
breaks you in combat isn't
always your gear its your


690
0:21:42,934 --> 0:21:45,269
intestinal fortitude
and that's exactly


691
0:21:45,269 --> 0:21:46,471
what you had
right there.


692
0:21:46,471 --> 0:21:47,705
That's exactly
what you showed me.


693
0:21:47,705 --> 0:21:48,873
Travis Taylor: One of
the things I learned


694
0:21:48,873 --> 0:21:50,908
a lot was uh was
something about myself.


695
0:21:50,908 --> 0:21:53,745
That I believe I could
push through some things


696
0:21:53,745 --> 0:21:55,88
that I didn't think
I could before and,


697
0:21:55,88 --> 0:21:57,515
and had it not been
for Bill Bodette


698
0:21:57,515 --> 0:21:59,16
I probably wouldn't
have done that.


699
0:21:59,16 --> 0:22:0,151
Travis Taylor:
You know what?


700
0:22:0,151 --> 0:22:2,153
I believe with a little
bit of training I could


701
0:22:2,153 --> 0:22:5,56
run a marathon
in this thing.


702
0:22:5,56 --> 0:22:15,933
So I did run a
marathon in this suit.


703
0:22:15,933 --> 0:22:19,237
26.2 miles in a
40-pound suit;


704
0:22:19,237 --> 0:22:21,239
it took me over 6 hours.


705
0:22:21,239 --> 0:22:22,473
Like I said, I'm
a science geek from


706
0:22:22,473 --> 0:22:24,675
North Alabama
and I did this.


707
0:22:24,675 --> 0:22:25,643
Thank you very much, man.


708
0:22:25,643 --> 0:22:26,677
Marine: Congratulations.


709
0:22:26,677 --> 0:22:27,578
Travis Taylor: Think
what a young strappin'


710
0:22:27,578 --> 0:24:27,578
marine could do.
