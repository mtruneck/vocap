1
0:0:0,14 --> 0:0:4,6
somebody's as senior vice president
kevin brown in sotheby's isn't realistic


2
0:0:4,6 --> 0:0:10,329
company well underground states that as
he recently two years ago sold eight


3
0:0:10,329 --> 0:0:15,449
an apartment in manhattan for six point
five million dollars now that's not


4
0:0:15,449 --> 0:0:19,3
farfetched of course apartments in new
york are extremely expensive


5
0:0:19,3 --> 0:0:21,82
the person who purchased the apartment


6
0:0:21,82 --> 0:0:26,23
was at chinese woman how she is
identified we don't know exactly who she


7
0:0:26,23 --> 0:0:30,689
is admits she was purchasing the six
point five million dollar apartment


8
0:0:30,689 --> 0:0:33,4
for her to year-old daughter


9
0:0:33,4 --> 0:0:37,43
of peace it does business and my wife's
trainees at a two year old need we have


10
0:0:37,43 --> 0:0:39,89
a six point five million dollar bar in
new york


11
0:0:39,89 --> 0:0:44,16
we do not before skepticism and we
really wealthy


12
0:0:44,16 --> 0:0:47,71
your two-year-old needs to be able to
stretch out in a nice apartment in new


13
0:0:47,71 --> 0:0:48,53
york city


14
0:0:48,53 --> 0:0:51,39
belittling kiddo why wife now wide


15
0:0:51,39 --> 0:0:52,34
mentioned you


16
0:0:52,34 --> 0:0:55,83
now kevin brown explains in detail he
says i have


17
0:0:55,83 --> 0:1:0,51
well her daughter was going to see and
go to columbia or n_y_u_ or maybe harbor


18
0:1:0,51 --> 0:1:4,159
and so she needed to be in the center of
the city and that was why she was


19
0:1:4,159 --> 0:1:6,189
picking this one particular apartment


20
0:1:6,189 --> 0:1:10,3
so i said our college and honor and she
said well see still


21
0:1:10,3 --> 0:1:14,44
and i was just shocked unloaded she does
with specificity


22
0:1:14,44 --> 0:1:16,83
let's go to the columbia renoir u


23
0:1:16,83 --> 0:1:20,7
enhance his yet her two-year-old
daughter department at


24
0:1:20,7 --> 0:1:24,31
i got bad news for harbored would be a
telecommute


25
0:1:24,31 --> 0:1:27,86
that seven boston that's going to be
about five hours


26
0:1:27,86 --> 0:1:31,39
place it's kinda fast and she went with
that uh... i think it was definitely


27
0:1:31,39 --> 0:1:35,22
more of a real estate investment that
anything else because she did purchase


28
0:1:35,22 --> 0:1:36,969
that apartment two years ago


29
0:1:36,969 --> 0:1:40,26
and a half frank's did increase
significantly


30
0:1:40,26 --> 0:1:43,27
as i mentioned she takes six point five
million dollars for it


31
0:1:43,27 --> 0:1:45,5
however it now costs


32
0:1:45,5 --> 0:1:50,6
eight point nine million dollars
motorola so in essence you just made


33
0:1:50,6 --> 0:1:54,56
more than enough money um... on her
investments you pay for her daughter's


34
0:1:54,56 --> 0:1:56,69
education


35
0:1:56,69 --> 0:1:59,909
uh... under review for graduated for a
pc


36
0:1:59,909 --> 0:2:1,119
indeed going to do it


37
0:2:1,119 --> 0:2:4,32
live weather is is the most of the
daughter honestly is that in china


38
0:2:4,32 --> 0:2:7,159
uh... there's been sp some laws passed
recently


39
0:2:7,159 --> 0:2:8,349
where the state


40
0:2:8,349 --> 0:2:11,689
uh... you'd only own one property but
not the i don't think that would apply


41
0:2:11,689 --> 0:2:12,41
here


42
0:2:12,41 --> 0:2:14,459
i was kisses in the u_s_ is not in china


43
0:2:14,459 --> 0:2:16,9
nose was a recent she wanted to years
ago


44
0:2:16,9 --> 0:2:19,61
but i don't and bring them up because
i'm not sure if there was some other


45
0:2:19,61 --> 0:2:22,9
tricky pretty do


46
0:2:22,9 --> 0:2:26,349
position for tax reasons as sarah to say
that she bought it for a daughter


47
0:2:26,349 --> 0:2:27,849
because otherwise it's just


48
0:2:27,849 --> 0:2:31,459
wait to absurd now there have been some
accusations as i mentioned we don't have


49
0:2:31,459 --> 0:2:35,19
this woman is that a lot of people are
speculating and death thinking that


50
0:2:35,19 --> 0:2:39,739
maybe she is related to some corrupt
politician in china which is why the


51
0:2:39,739 --> 0:2:43,259
powerful this kind of money abhe
disposal


52
0:2:43,259 --> 0:2:45,23
and i like the smugness this you soon


53
0:2:45,23 --> 0:2:48,7
rooms that are two-year-old limited to
an ivy league school relies on let's


54
0:2:48,7 --> 0:2:52,92
talk about that for a second right so
let's think about hypothetical where as


55
0:2:52,92 --> 0:2:56,8
she's not related to some crop
politician and she doesn't know people


56
0:2:56,8 --> 0:2:57,789
who can pull strings right


57
0:2:57,789 --> 0:2:59,72
and she's just a mother


58
0:2:59,72 --> 0:3:2,68
assumes that her daughter is going to
get into one of the school speak about


59
0:3:2,68 --> 0:3:5,569
the amount of pressure that puts on her
daughter


60
0:3:5,569 --> 0:3:10,15
the who donated a pressured soooo
pressure anyway but what i wanna say


61
0:3:10,15 --> 0:3:11,64
instance that it could


62
0:3:11,64 --> 0:3:14,96
are backing so that's really interesting
i was a ship because


63
0:3:14,96 --> 0:3:19,269
so uh... we have a friend uh...
polyester but that's what i see


64
0:3:19,269 --> 0:3:21,599
his son is an absolute genius like


65
0:3:21,599 --> 0:3:24,249
leaving in season for the words are


66
0:3:24,249 --> 0:3:25,549
his accused


67
0:3:25,549 --> 0:3:27,649
two forty


68
0:3:27,649 --> 0:3:31,89
two forty is off the freakin chart and


69
0:3:31,89 --> 0:3:34,469
he was reading newspapers at the age of
three


70
0:3:34,469 --> 0:3:39,26
okay so u_n_ tour at one of the top
probably bad cop twenty private schools


71
0:3:39,26 --> 0:3:43,29
in the country at one of them is here in
l_a_ nestle when he went to


72
0:3:43,29 --> 0:3:45,949
uh... and he got a perfect s_a_t_ score


73
0:3:45,949 --> 0:3:48,959
but he was a little bored by the classes
and slacked off his sheep here was only


74
0:3:48,959 --> 0:3:50,809
three point nine


75
0:3:50,809 --> 0:3:54,749
but they would release it like that it
was only three point nine


76
0:3:54,749 --> 0:3:58,409
uh... he did not get into a any of the
ideas


77
0:3:58,409 --> 0:3:59,799
sitting in the stanford


78
0:3:59,799 --> 0:4:2,169
didn't get any u_c_l_a_


79
0:4:2,169 --> 0:4:3,719
didn't get into


80
0:4:3,719 --> 0:4:4,919
carnegie mellon


81
0:4:4,919 --> 0:4:7,329
didn't get into paths


82
0:4:7,329 --> 0:4:9,589
okay


83
0:4:9,589 --> 0:4:14,589
so you are receiving your kid is going
to get into an ivy league school


84
0:4:14,589 --> 0:4:16,859
detective so before you read this up


85
0:4:16,859 --> 0:4:20,59

the constitution of the why what my


86
0:4:20,59 --> 0:4:21,829
two-year-old


87
0:4:21,829 --> 0:4:24,16
seven or one of those whose i do


88
0:4:24,16 --> 0:4:27,53

necessary getting better than perfect


89
0:4:27,53 --> 0:4:28,819
scores


90
0:4:28,819 --> 0:4:32,6
to get their i'm not so sure about them
and i want them to have a childhood


91
0:4:32,6 --> 0:4:37,4
select wanna put good expectations on
'em but at the same time initially to


92
0:4:37,4 --> 0:4:40,9
compete with these people


93
0:4:40,9 --> 0:4:42,849
all have pervert his state these scores
in


94
0:4:42,849 --> 0:4:46,469

but he might break in it you gotta have
enjoyed haven't heard enjoyed


96
0:4:50,41 --> 0:6:50,41
