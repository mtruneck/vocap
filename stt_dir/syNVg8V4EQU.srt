1
0:0:19,669 --> 0:0:22,239
Over the last few months, I've been
approached several times about the


2
0:0:22,239 --> 0:0:23,609
subject of death,


3
0:0:23,609 --> 0:0:28,46
including a tag by the wonderful Largo64, and the glorious Rozeboosje,


4
0:0:28,46 --> 0:0:30,73
enquires about psychological studies,


5
0:0:30,73 --> 0:0:33,379
assertions that I'm 'pro-mortality',


6
0:0:33,379 --> 0:0:36,91
questions about my responses to some
thought-terminating cliches,


7
0:0:36,91 --> 0:0:39,7
and about my personal outlook.


8
0:0:39,7 --> 0:0:42,5
I've always been fascinated by how we
cope with death --


9
0:0:42,5 --> 0:0:45,33
or more interestingly how we fail to
cope with it,


10
0:0:45,33 --> 0:0:48,95
with all the destructive consequences
those failures bring.


11
0:0:48,95 --> 0:0:52,5
It's also had some personal residence
for me recently.


12
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:55,95
It feels the right time to share that I
started experiencing throat problems a few


13
0:0:55,95 --> 0:0:58,36
months ago that wouldn't go away.


14
0:0:58,36 --> 0:1:0,22
When I reported the symptoms,


15
0:1:0,22 --> 0:1:3,95
the doctors immediately suspected an
aggressive type of cancer that one of my


16
0:1:3,95 --> 0:1:7,82
brothers died of, and I was rushed
through a series of tests.


17
0:1:7,82 --> 0:1:10,909
I recently received the results of those
tests.


18
0:1:10,909 --> 0:1:13,11
My condition is benign.


19
0:1:13,11 --> 0:1:16,909
Given this temporary stay of execution, I
thought I'd address all of these


20
0:1:16,909 --> 0:1:19,109
solicitations in two videos,


21
0:1:19,109 --> 0:1:20,68
dedicated to death.


22
0:1:20,68 --> 0:1:22,49
But before I begin,


23
0:1:22,49 --> 0:1:26,6
I'd like to invite you to take a moment
to consider your personal reaction to


24
0:1:26,6 --> 0:1:28,0
these videos about death --


25
0:1:28,0 --> 0:1:29,819
your reactions as you watch them


26
0:1:29,819 --> 0:1:34,2
and also before you started watching,
when you saw they were available.


27
0:1:34,2 --> 0:1:36,79
What with the thoughts and feelings that
came up for you?


28
0:1:36,79 --> 0:1:38,13
Were they positive?


29
0:1:38,13 --> 0:1:39,98
Negative? Mixed?


30
0:1:39,98 --> 0:1:41,7
Blank?


31
0:1:41,7 --> 0:1:44,759
I'd invite you to hold these responses
in mind


32
0:1:44,759 --> 0:1:46,11
and, if it feels ok,


33
0:1:46,11 --> 0:1:51,42
perhaps share some of them.


34
0:1:51,42 --> 0:1:54,75
We have a lot to deal with in this experience
we call life don't we?


35
0:1:54,75 --> 0:1:58,61
At the most basic level, we're faced with the
physical challenges of survival:


36
0:1:58,61 --> 0:2:1,61
finding and competing for food,


37
0:2:1,61 --> 0:2:2,63
water, shelter,


38
0:2:2,63 --> 0:2:4,27
and -- if we so inclined --


39
0:2:4,27 --> 0:2:5,64
sexual partners,


40
0:2:5,64 --> 0:2:8,56
while distancing ourselves from diseases,


41
0:2:8,56 --> 0:2:9,649
parasites,


42
0:2:9,649 --> 0:2:10,53
predators,


43
0:2:10,53 --> 0:2:12,209
natural disasters.


44
0:2:12,209 --> 0:2:15,549
On the social level, we find ourselves
within a species containing huge


45
0:2:15,549 --> 0:2:16,76
variation.


46
0:2:16,76 --> 0:2:20,83
We must determine the significance of
these differences -- if indeed there is any --


47
0:2:20,83 --> 0:2:23,779
and find our own place within this
variety.


48
0:2:23,779 --> 0:2:25,25
On the psychological level


49
0:2:25,25 --> 0:2:27,849
we wrestle with all kinds of unknowns,


50
0:2:27,849 --> 0:2:29,9
unpredictabilities,


51
0:2:29,9 --> 0:2:31,709
ambiguities, dissonances.


52
0:2:31,709 --> 0:2:34,829
We live with swathes of unanswered
questions:


53
0:2:34,829 --> 0:2:37,129
questions about the universe we find
around us,


54
0:2:37,129 --> 0:2:39,289
and the one we find inside us:


55
0:2:39,289 --> 0:2:44,379
our own mind, with so many of its
processes blocked out of our awareness.


56
0:2:44,379 --> 0:2:47,619
Perhaps the most profound paradox we
experience comes when we bring the


57
0:2:47,619 --> 0:2:52,179
universe and the mind together -- as the
meaningless meets the meaning-hungry.


58
0:2:52,179 --> 0:2:56,429
Within that paradox, the task we seem to
find most intimidating of all is


59
0:2:56,429 --> 0:2:58,389
the business of confronting death.


60
0:2:58,389 --> 0:3:2,309
We can infer that level of intimidation
by the extreme lengths we employ to deny


61
0:3:2,309 --> 0:3:3,289
death.


62
0:3:3,289 --> 0:3:5,1
Extreme protected lengths,


63
0:3:5,1 --> 0:3:8,51
employing a range of physical and
psychological barriers to block


64
0:3:8,51 --> 0:3:9,229
the fear out,


65
0:3:9,229 --> 0:3:13,859
and extreme aggressive lengths,
dehumanising, attacking and killing those


66
0:3:13,859 --> 0:3:16,189
who face us with our fears.


67
0:3:16,189 --> 0:3:20,329
We witness and experience all kinds of
disproportionate emotional responses in


68
0:3:20,329 --> 0:3:21,159
life.


69
0:3:21,159 --> 0:3:23,87
An example familiar to us all is phobias.


70
0:3:23,87 --> 0:3:27,15
For the phobic individual, there's a
sizeable mismatch between the perceived


71
0:3:27,15 --> 0:3:32,0
and actual levels of threat associated
with the phobic object or situation.


72
0:3:32,0 --> 0:3:37,37
As a child, I was arachnophobic. I ascribed a
quasi-human intelligence to


73
0:3:37,37 --> 0:3:38,729
the spider's stealthy behaviour,


74
0:3:38,729 --> 0:3:41,56
and imagined that its goal was to get
into my mouth.


75
0:3:41,56 --> 0:3:44,769
I never questioned why it might want to do
that.


76
0:3:44,769 --> 0:3:48,359
But that's the self-preserving nature of
fair -- it facilitates irrational


77
0:3:48,359 --> 0:3:52,149
fantasies and pseudo-explanations that
maintain the fear,


78
0:3:52,149 --> 0:3:55,589
while simultaneously diminishing our
capacity for the kinds of rational


79
0:3:55,589 --> 0:3:57,949
processing that might break its hold.


80
0:3:57,949 --> 0:4:1,849
One of the saving graces of phobias is that they're generally owned by the


81
0:4:1,849 --> 0:4:2,909
individual.


82
0:4:2,909 --> 0:4:6,379
As that arachnophobic child, I didn't go round thinking everyone else was


83
0:4:6,379 --> 0:4:8,549
wrong not to have a spider phobia.


84
0:4:8,549 --> 0:4:10,359
I knew the problem was mine.


85
0:4:10,359 --> 0:4:13,62
But there are other kinds of
disproportionate emotional responses


86
0:4:13,62 --> 0:4:17,339
where ownership of one's own fears aren't so easily accepted.


87
0:4:17,339 --> 0:4:19,249
As a child coming up to 14,


88
0:4:19,249 --> 0:4:21,979
about to announce my departure from the
religion into which I'd been


89
0:4:21,979 --> 0:4:23,11
indoctrinated,


90
0:4:23,11 --> 0:4:25,719
I actually expected a positive reaction.


91
0:4:25,719 --> 0:4:29,219
Having spent months in private thought,
trying to justify my belief in that


92
0:4:29,219 --> 0:4:30,1
religion,


93
0:4:30,1 --> 0:4:31,14
it dawned on me:


94
0:4:31,14 --> 0:4:35,43
every magical being so far had been
hoaxes played by the adults.


95
0:4:35,43 --> 0:4:39,7
I kicked myself for spending so much time working through the arguments and I looked forward


96
0:4:39,7 --> 0:4:42,58
to having a laugh with the adults when
they found out I'd seen through this


97
0:4:42,58 --> 0:4:44,38
religion hoax too.


98
0:4:44,38 --> 0:4:47,969
My announcement of non-belief was
greeted with rage,


99
0:4:47,969 --> 0:4:50,3
contempt and punishment.


100
0:4:50,3 --> 0:4:53,909
When the fatwa was declared on
Salman Rushdie in 1989,


101
0:4:53,909 --> 0:4:55,93
I initially dismissed it as a prank.


102
0:4:55,93 --> 0:4:59,189
Appealing to worldwide followers to
implement a death sentence


103
0:4:59,189 --> 0:5:0,779
just for writing a novel?


104
0:5:0,779 --> 0:5:5,599
I'd never heard anything so pathetic and
ridiculous â€” but Khomeini's decree was


105
0:5:5,599 --> 0:5:6,4
genuine.


106
0:5:6,4 --> 0:5:9,839
Such homicidal theocracies actually
existed.


107
0:5:9,839 --> 0:5:13,559
Ten years ago, a muslim friend of mine
shared that her nephew had come out to her


108
0:5:13,559 --> 0:5:14,59
as a homosexual.


109
0:5:14,59 --> 0:5:18,41
She told me that if their family found
out, he'd be taken to India and


110
0:5:18,41 --> 0:5:19,4
buried alive.


111
0:5:19,4 --> 0:5:23,71
Furthermore, if her family found out that she
knew and hadn't told them,


112
0:5:23,71 --> 0:5:26,0
the same would happen to her.


113
0:5:26,0 --> 0:5:29,83
Five years ago, when I first heard of the
anti-atheist hate widely promulgated


114
0:5:29,83 --> 0:5:33,97
across the US, I thought it had to be
some big national joke.


115
0:5:33,97 --> 0:5:35,229
Some trendy,


116
0:5:35,229 --> 0:5:37,36
ironic, faux-prejudice.


117
0:5:37,36 --> 0:5:39,46
When I realised it was serious,


118
0:5:39,46 --> 0:5:41,249
I joined the discourse.


119
0:5:41,249 --> 0:5:44,86
My focus back then was purely on the
prejudicial aspects, rather than debating


120
0:5:44,86 --> 0:5:46,36
the existence of gods.


121
0:5:46,36 --> 0:5:49,199
But in response to simply revealing my atheism


122
0:5:49,199 --> 0:5:51,33
I received death wishes,


123
0:5:51,33 --> 0:5:52,36
death threats,


124
0:5:52,36 --> 0:5:54,419
suggestions that I was already dead


125
0:5:54,419 --> 0:5:59,319
spiritually -- and of course salivating
references to my perpetual living death


126
0:5:59,319 --> 0:6:0,58
in hell.


127
0:6:0,58 --> 0:6:4,969
Talk about overkill. But I recognised some of
my own stuff here too.


128
0:6:4,969 --> 0:6:8,759
At age 12, when I was an active
christian, a religious education teacher


129
0:6:8,759 --> 0:6:12,949
asked me why I believe what I believed. The
question seemed innocuous enough at


130
0:6:12,949 --> 0:6:14,9
first.


131
0:6:14,9 --> 0:6:18,8
But as I reflected on it, I realised nothing valid was coming to mind.


132
0:6:18,8 --> 0:6:21,229
An appropriate response would've been to simply admit that.


133
0:6:21,229 --> 0:6:22,949
My actual response?


134
0:6:22,949 --> 0:6:27,359
I wanted that teacher wiped from the
face of the planet.


135
0:6:27,359 --> 0:6:31,179
What drives these extreme reactions? What's
the big deal?


136
0:6:31,179 --> 0:6:34,759
Were the believers here any less free to
believe whatever they wanted?


137
0:6:34,759 --> 0:6:38,919
Divine beliefs are generally claimed to
bring inner peace -- but what kind of inner


138
0:6:38,919 --> 0:6:43,9
peace is it that demands that other
people get their inner peace the same way ....


139
0:6:43,9 --> 0:6:45,29
or else!


140
0:6:45,29 --> 0:6:47,189
Clearly in each of these cases,


141
0:6:47,189 --> 0:6:50,24
with such hyper-aggressive defences
being mobilised,


142
0:6:50,24 --> 0:6:53,879
the aggressor was protecting something
tremendously fragile.


143
0:6:53,879 --> 0:6:56,229
Emerging out of the cocoon of religion,


144
0:6:56,229 --> 0:6:58,429
the big deal for me was death --


145
0:6:58,429 --> 0:7:2,389
realising that there was no reason
whatsoever to believe I'd be reborn,


146
0:7:2,389 --> 0:7:3,539
reincarnated,


147
0:7:3,539 --> 0:7:8,12
resurrected or reconstituted in any way
after my physical demise --


148
0:7:8,12 --> 0:7:12,479
let alone reunited with loved ones in
some sugary hereafter.


149
0:7:12,479 --> 0:7:16,659
It quickly occurred to me that this was of
course the prime psychological function


150
0:7:16,659 --> 0:7:20,39
of the part of our culture we label
'religion':


151
0:7:20,39 --> 0:7:22,69
to deny death.


152
0:7:22,69 --> 0:7:25,919
To reject the unthinkable thought that
when our brains stop,


153
0:7:25,919 --> 0:7:27,29
we stop.


154
0:7:27,29 --> 0:7:30,759
We have a host of other cultural
props and mechanisms explicitly designed to


155
0:7:30,759 --> 0:7:33,47
help us deal with the passing of friends
and family:


156
0:7:33,47 --> 0:7:36,129
ceremonies where we can share our
feelings;


157
0:7:36,129 --> 0:7:39,429
professional services to help us process
our bereavement;


158
0:7:39,429 --> 0:7:43,189
dedicated locations we can visit to
keep our memories alive.


159
0:7:43,189 --> 0:7:45,96
But for many of us, these things just aren't enough.


160
0:7:45,96 --> 0:7:48,39
The pain of fully letting go


161
0:7:48,39 --> 0:7:49,789
feels unendurable.


162
0:7:49,789 --> 0:7:50,86
Added to which,


163
0:7:50,86 --> 0:7:53,21
if we admit the finality of our loved
ones,


164
0:7:53,21 --> 0:7:56,11
we're implicitly faced with our own
finality.


165
0:7:56,11 --> 0:7:59,43
In this state of denial, we seek out illusions


166
0:7:59,43 --> 0:8:5,409
that offer a promise of perpetuity.


167
0:8:5,409 --> 0:8:9,619
On the physical front, there's not much
scope for illusions of perpetuity --


168
0:8:9,619 --> 0:8:12,249
corpses wreak of finality.


169
0:8:12,249 --> 0:8:16,9
In the initial stages, while they still
maintain some semblance of the living state,


170
0:8:16,9 --> 0:8:20,49
we might just about be able to
sustain some fantasies consistent with


171
0:8:20,49 --> 0:8:21,27
natural processes --


172
0:8:21,27 --> 0:8:23,909
for example that the person's merely
sleeping.


173
0:8:23,909 --> 0:8:25,88
But when the decay really kicks in,


174
0:8:25,88 --> 0:8:29,209
the evidence of finality is just too
uncomfortable.


175
0:8:29,209 --> 0:8:30,65
To deny death,


176
0:8:30,65 --> 0:8:34,58
we turn to the non-physical -- to the
realm of symbolic thought.


177
0:8:34,58 --> 0:8:38,6
Our capacity for this kind of thinking has
led us to entertain a multitude of


178
0:8:38,6 --> 0:8:40,73
figurative forms of immortality.


179
0:8:40,73 --> 0:8:43,71
Some folks see themselves preserved in
their children.


180
0:8:43,71 --> 0:8:47,29
Some folks pursue their own individual
fame or power as a buffer against extinction.


181
0:8:47,29 --> 0:8:52,2
Some devote themselves to
influential figures, or invest themselves


182
0:8:52,2 --> 0:8:55,91
in a group they feel to be emblematic of
their own values.


183
0:8:55,91 --> 0:9:0,17
Impersonal cultural institutions like
the law offer a sense of order and


184
0:9:0,17 --> 0:9:1,79
protection,


185
0:9:1,79 --> 0:9:5,4
diminishing our awareness of disorder
and vulnerability.


186
0:9:5,4 --> 0:9:9,38
Architecture, built to spend many
lifetimes, provides a huge reinforcement


187
0:9:9,38 --> 0:9:13,66
of symbolic permanence. But our ultimate psychological alchemy came when we


188
0:9:13,66 --> 0:9:17,58
managed to convince ourselves our
symbolic self could exist outside


189
0:9:17,58 --> 0:9:19,11
our literal self.


190
0:9:19,11 --> 0:9:21,0
We called it a 'soul'.


191
0:9:21,0 --> 0:9:24,75
Once humans had committed this violation,
there was really no end to the


192
0:9:24,75 --> 0:9:26,249
possibilities on offer.


193
0:9:26,249 --> 0:9:28,829
The soul could be reborn in another body --


194
0:9:28,829 --> 0:9:30,419
perhaps another species.


195
0:9:30,419 --> 0:9:32,88
It could be reinserted in the same body.


196
0:9:32,88 --> 0:9:36,14
It could even simply continue with
nobody at all.


197
0:9:36,14 --> 0:9:39,69
On the face of it, the concept of the
independent soul


198
0:9:39,69 --> 0:9:43,4
would seem to provide enough denial to
keep everyone happy.


199
0:9:43,4 --> 0:9:45,34
So why isn't everyone happy?


200
0:9:45,34 --> 0:9:49,74
The problem with illusions is that they're devilishly difficult things to maintain.


201
0:9:49,74 --> 0:9:53,81
Not only do they constantly run up
against reality -- they're also vulnerable to


202
0:9:53,81 --> 0:9:55,419
competing illusions.


203
0:9:55,419 --> 0:10:0,559
Group A denies death with a fantasy in
which the soul departs to a paradise or


204
0:10:0,559 --> 0:10:2,0
realm of torture


205
0:10:2,0 --> 0:10:3,96
after one physical life.


206
0:10:3,96 --> 0:10:7,12
Group B denies death with a fantasy in
which the soul just keeps getting


207
0:10:7,12 --> 0:10:9,38
reincarnated on Earth.


208
0:10:9,38 --> 0:10:11,39
When these fantasies meet


209
0:10:11,39 --> 0:10:12,93
there's gonna be a clash.


210
0:10:12,93 --> 0:10:16,89
The existence of the competing illusion
serves as a constant contradiction to


211
0:10:16,89 --> 0:10:17,87
the other --


212
0:10:17,87 --> 0:10:21,7
undermining its death-denying capability.


213
0:10:21,7 --> 0:10:26,5
It soon becomes clear that, in order to keep a death-denying illusion going, everyone has


214
0:10:26,5 --> 0:10:27,77
to believe the same thing.


215
0:10:27,77 --> 0:10:31,4
Over the years, I've noticed a range of
strategies to reduce the threat of


216
0:10:31,4 --> 0:10:33,34
conflicting ideas.


217
0:10:33,34 --> 0:10:37,17
They might simply be dismissed as
ridiculous, implausible,


218
0:10:37,17 --> 0:10:38,61
maybe primitive.


219
0:10:38,61 --> 0:10:42,3
But however much we try to dismiss
conflicting ideas psychologically,


220
0:10:42,3 --> 0:10:44,86
it's much better if they're just not there at all.


221
0:10:44,86 --> 0:10:49,2
History's festooned with aggressive
proselytisation programmes,


222
0:10:49,2 --> 0:10:52,34
where one death-denying illusion is displaced by another.


223
0:10:52,34 --> 0:10:55,98
Sometimes the poison's sweetened by the
addition of medical aid,


224
0:10:55,98 --> 0:10:58,399
or enhanced educational prospects,


225
0:10:58,399 --> 0:11:2,97
supporting the aggressors' delusion that
they're 'helping the savages' -- rather than


226
0:11:2,97 --> 0:11:4,89
eliminating the competition.


227
0:11:4,89 --> 0:11:8,46
History also abounds with the more
violent step up from that,


228
0:11:8,46 --> 0:11:12,97
when members of the competing death-denying illusion are exterminated.


229
0:11:12,97 --> 0:11:17,309
Where dismissal, proselytisation or
murder seen non-viable,


230
0:11:17,309 --> 0:11:18,75
we have the truce.


231
0:11:18,75 --> 0:11:22,36
Here parties focus on common aspects
between the illusions,


232
0:11:22,36 --> 0:11:25,319
while trying to downplay the threatening
differences.


233
0:11:25,319 --> 0:11:28,119
Some folks have tried this with christianity
and islam


234
0:11:28,119 --> 0:11:30,16
saying it's the same god.


235
0:11:30,16 --> 0:11:32,739
Problem is, it isn't the same god


236
0:11:32,739 --> 0:11:34,75
The god that gave its only son


237
0:11:34,75 --> 0:11:38,139
in explicit reference to a purported
original sin


238
0:11:38,139 --> 0:11:40,65
is not the god that had no such son.


239
0:11:40,65 --> 0:11:43,79
This is not a minor detail that can be
discarded.


240
0:11:43,79 --> 0:11:46,98
It informs the whole rationale for the
belief.


241
0:11:46,98 --> 0:11:50,399
And beneath all the magnanimous gestures
towards inclusion,


242
0:11:50,399 --> 0:11:52,93
multiculturalism and pluralism,


243
0:11:52,93 --> 0:11:55,58
these differences are not forgotten.


244
0:11:55,58 --> 0:12:0,1
The inherent supremacism of the individual's ideology merely moves from


245
0:12:0,1 --> 0:12:0,84
overt


246
0:12:0,84 --> 0:12:2,6
to covert.


247
0:12:2,6 --> 0:12:3,57
And when things get rocky,


248
0:12:3,57 --> 0:12:6,19
that supremacism is quick to surface.


249
0:12:6,19 --> 0:12:8,86
Out come the flags, the icons,


250
0:12:8,86 --> 0:12:10,609
and the feverish assertions


251
0:12:10,609 --> 0:12:13,11
of monoculture.


252
0:12:13,11 --> 0:12:17,83
Truces have an elastic limit. Finding
common ground gets harder as differences


253
0:12:17,83 --> 0:12:22,12
between groups increase. When confronted
with groups who have no divine beliefs


254
0:12:22,12 --> 0:12:26,839
at all, it is of course possible to offer a truce based on human values.


255
0:12:26,839 --> 0:12:31,44
But that tacitly acknowledges the redundancy of divine beliefs.


256
0:12:31,44 --> 0:12:32,18
Hence


257
0:12:32,18 --> 0:12:37,45
strategy number five: emotional blackmail.
Here, folks attempt to coerce those who


258
0:12:37,45 --> 0:12:42,13
don't share their illusions into silence
by evoking guilt or fear.


259
0:12:42,13 --> 0:12:44,72
Sometimes the blackmail his preemptive.


260
0:12:44,72 --> 0:12:48,14
The blackmailer lets it be known publicly
that they couldn't bear it if anyone


261
0:12:48,14 --> 0:12:50,8
confronted their illusions.


262
0:12:50,8 --> 0:12:52,39
Other times, the blackmail's reactive.


263
0:12:52,39 --> 0:12:55,87
The blackmailer tries to stifle any further
challenge with the same manipulative


264
0:12:55,87 --> 0:12:56,92
methods --


265
0:12:56,92 --> 0:13:0,4
casting folks who expose their illusions
as cruel,


266
0:13:0,4 --> 0:13:2,37
destructive and heartless --


267
0:13:2,37 --> 0:13:5,29
hoping they'll be persuaded to mask their
dissent.


268
0:13:5,29 --> 0:13:9,8
Whatever the strategy, the goal is the same.
Unable to withstand scrutiny or challenge,


269
0:13:9,8 --> 0:13:14,15
the poorly constructed illusion can only survive by blocking


270
0:13:14,15 --> 0:13:14,96
them out.


271
0:13:14,96 --> 0:13:19,42
Having reflected on this death denial
over several years, it was intriguing to


272
0:13:19,42 --> 0:13:23,79
come across experimental support last
year, when my friend Tim introduced me to


273
0:13:23,79 --> 0:13:26,98
the work of Sheldon Solomon, Tom Pyszczynski


274
0:13:26,98 --> 0:13:28,7
and Jeff Greenberg --


275
0:13:28,7 --> 0:13:36,39
the proponents of 'terror management
theory'.


276
0:13:36,39 --> 0:13:38,199
Sheldon Solomon explains:


277
0:13:38,199 --> 0:13:41,12
'If culture serves a death-denying function


278
0:13:41,12 --> 0:13:43,32
then if you remind people that they're going to die,


279
0:13:43,32 --> 0:13:46,86
that should momentarily .... increase the
need for the death-denying aspects of


280
0:13:46,86 --> 0:13:48,91
their particular beliefs about reality --


281
0:13:48,91 --> 0:13:52,47
and that should be reflected by their
reactions to other individuals, who


282
0:13:52,47 --> 0:13:54,86
either bolster or support those beliefs,


283
0:13:54,86 --> 0:13:58,79
or who undermine those beliefs by either
being hostile to them,


284
0:13:58,79 --> 0:14:0,37
or merely different from them.


285
0:14:0,37 --> 0:14:3,25
The terror management team have
conducted scores of studies to


286
0:14:3,25 --> 0:14:4,529
investigate this


287
0:14:4,529 --> 0:14:7,35
'mortality salience hypothesis'.


288
0:14:7,35 --> 0:14:11,3
In a study into attitudes, two groups
of christian subjects were asked to


289
0:14:11,3 --> 0:14:15,52
fill out a questionnaire, ostensibly about
how people form impressions of others.


290
0:14:15,52 --> 0:14:18,65
The questions in one group were specifically phrased to remind the reader


291
0:14:18,65 --> 0:14:20,98
of his or her own death.


292
0:14:20,98 --> 0:14:24,9
Both groups were then asked for their
impressions of two fictitious students


293
0:14:24,9 --> 0:14:27,1
who shared personality traits.


294
0:14:27,1 --> 0:14:28,589
One student was a christian.


295
0:14:28,589 --> 0:14:30,3
The other was jewish.


296
0:14:30,3 --> 0:14:33,51
Subjects who'd been reminded of their own
death gave an especially positive


297
0:14:33,51 --> 0:14:37,51
assessment of the christian and an
especially negative one of the jew.


298
0:14:37,51 --> 0:14:41,5
The subjects who weren't reminded of their death showed no preference.


299
0:14:41,5 --> 0:14:45,44
Another study investigated the effects
of mortality salience on behaviour,


300
0:14:45,44 --> 0:14:48,99
looking at subjects' willingness to use
cultural symbols and icons in


301
0:14:48,99 --> 0:14:50,83
inappropriate ways.


302
0:14:50,83 --> 0:14:55,399
In the first of two tasks, subjects were
given a variety of objects


303
0:14:55,399 --> 0:14:59,43
and asked sift sand from a jar with
water and ink.


304
0:14:59,43 --> 0:15:3,19
The American flag was the only object that would do the job.


305
0:15:3,19 --> 0:15:4,79
In the second task,


306
0:15:4,79 --> 0:15:8,56
subjects had to hang a crucifix on the
wall -- but in order to do that


307
0:15:8,56 --> 0:15:11,53
they had to use the crucifix to bang the
nail in.


308
0:15:11,53 --> 0:15:14,98
Subjects who'd been reminded of death in
a prior questionnaire


309
0:15:14,98 --> 0:15:17,55
took twice as long as those who hadn't.


310
0:15:17,55 --> 0:15:20,69
The researchers also looked into the
effects of mortality salience on


311
0:15:20,69 --> 0:15:22,79
subjects' choice a political candidate,


312
0:15:22,79 --> 0:15:26,94
using campaign statements expressing
three different leadership styles.


313
0:15:26,94 --> 0:15:31,29
The task-orientated leader's statement
emphasised high but achievable goals


314
0:15:31,29 --> 0:15:35,33
implemented through efficient resourcing
and delegation. The relationship-orientated


315
0:15:35,33 --> 0:15:40,29
leader's statement focused on
respect, compassion, trust,


316
0:15:40,29 --> 0:15:41,209
communication


317
0:15:41,209 --> 0:15:42,91
and appreciation.


318
0:15:42,91 --> 0:15:46,42
The charismatic leader's statement alluded to
the nation's greatness


319
0:15:46,42 --> 0:15:51,62
and stressed the importance of vision and
group identity. Initially, only 4%


320
0:15:51,62 --> 0:15:53,79
voted for the charismatic leader,


321
0:15:53,79 --> 0:15:57,12
with the remainder fairly evenly split
between the other two.


322
0:15:57,12 --> 0:15:59,119
But when subjects were reminded of death,


323
0:15:59,119 --> 0:16:3,17
votes for the charismatic leader
soared to 33%.


324
0:16:3,17 --> 0:16:4,13
Interestingly,


325
0:16:4,13 --> 0:16:8,14
votes for the relationship-orientated statement fell sharply.


326
0:16:8,14 --> 0:16:12,81
The researchers noted how these results
echoed George Bush's rise in popularity


327
0:16:12,81 --> 0:16:17,2
around the 9/11 attacks, with his
appeals to the nation's greatness and


328
0:16:17,2 --> 0:16:20,179
righteous war against the axis of evil.


329
0:16:20,179 --> 0:16:23,629
In a subsequent experiment, the
researchers found that reminders of both


330
0:16:23,629 --> 0:16:28,14
mortality and 9/11 significantly increased support for Bush --


331
0:16:28,14 --> 0:16:30,16
not just among conservatives


332
0:16:30,16 --> 0:16:31,55
but also liberals.


333
0:16:31,55 --> 0:16:35,26
As the researchers pointed out, we
should be extremely concerned


334
0:16:35,26 --> 0:16:39,3
at how easy it is to manipulate an electorate's political preferences through


335
0:16:39,3 --> 0:16:42,97
appeals to a combination of nationalism
and fear.


336
0:16:42,97 --> 0:16:46,77
While it's natural to fear legitimate threats, we'd do well to keep some


337
0:16:46,77 --> 0:16:51,93
rational perspective and demand facts, rather
than allow ourselves to be seduced by


338
0:16:51,93 --> 0:16:56,99
heroic, fear-based rhetoric.


339
0:16:56,99 --> 0:17:1,43
In this video, I looked at the illusions we construct to deny death


340
0:17:1,43 --> 0:17:5,9
and how they lead to divisive and
disproportionate emotional responses


341
0:17:5,9 --> 0:17:8,33
to folks who don't share those illusions.


342
0:17:8,33 --> 0:17:13,45
In the second video, I'll be exploring several
other grave subjects, including the label


343
0:17:13,45 --> 0:17:18,41
of 'pro-mortality atheist', the demands of immortality, the claim that there are


344
0:17:18,41 --> 0:17:22,44
'no atheists in foxholes', and the
possibility of peace of mind without


345
0:17:22,44 --> 0:19:22,44
recourse to illusion.
