###18 SUROOSH ALVI: And this is about as quiet as it gets.
###21 
###26 Hajj is the largest annual pilgrimage in the world.
###29 It happens in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
###31 And for Muslims, it's a requirement that you have to
###33 do once in your lifetime.
###35 The Saudi government estimated that last year there were over
###38 3 million pilgrims who attended, but the unofficial
###41 number is much higher.
###44 My parents are originally from Lahore, Pakistan.
###47 They're practicing Muslims, and last year they decided it
###50 was time for them to perform Hajj.
###52 So I went with them to help them with their journey, but
###55 also for myself as well.
###57 It was the first time for all of us.
###59 And I didn't go thinking I was going to make a VBS
###61 documentary.
###62 I just took the smallest handicam we had the office and
###65 literally shot from the hip.
###67 You're not allowed to shoot in most of the holy places.
###69 So this is the footage I managed to sneak out.
###73 We flew on Saudi Arabian airlines.
###74 It was about a 10 hour flight from JFK to Medina, where we
###78 spent 6 days getting mentally prepared for the Hajj that we
###81 were about to embark on.
###83 
###85 In pre-Islamic times, Medina was a place where the
###89 travelers who were crossing the desert in camel caravans
###93 would come to rest.
###94 It was kind of like a desert oasis.
###96 In modern times it's kind of the same thing, but there are
###98 less camels and more shopping malls and hotels.
###101 There's also stunning mosque there called the Prophet's
###104 Mosque, which is the second-holiest site in Islam.
###107 
###112 When you're there, you basically just go to the
###113 mosque five times a day, for six days straight, to get into
###117 a meditative state.
###120 The mosque is huge.
###121 It holds almost 700,000 people.
###123 And when we were there for the Friday prayer, it
###125 was pretty much full.
###127 
###130 Flying to Mecca from Medina was really interesting.
###133 Before we went to the airport, we cleansed ourselves in a
###136 very specific way.
###137 And then we had to put on a white seamless garment made
###142 our of terrycloth that all the pilgrims have to wear.
###144 And it's a renunciation of the life that you come from and is
###149 supposed to put everyone on the same level.
###152 There is no upper class or lower class.
###153 Everyone's the same.
###154 It's just you and the sheet, and that's it.
###157 [PRAYING]
###161 This is called getting into a state of Irham.
###163 Besides the clothes, there are a lot of other rules.
###166 You can't smoke.
###166 You can't have sex.
###168 You can't shave.
###169 You can't cut your nails, and there are a
###172 bunch of other no-no's.
###175 So we got this charter, just for the pilgrims, and 10
###178 minutes after the plane took off from Medina, the captain
###181 announced that we'd flown over a designation, and we were in
###184 the zone near Mecca.
###186 And we all had to start saying a prayer.
###188 And our group guide got onto the loudspeaker system of the
###192 airplane and started yelling the prayer.
###195 Everyone started chanting it.
###196 And I had a moment where I looked around and saw all of
###199 these men and women in their white robes, the men with
###202 their beards, and just thought, if someone from the
###204 West could see us right now, they would think we were a
###206 bunch of fanatical Jihadis on some kind of an insane
###209 mission, when in reality, it was just pilgrims excited to
###213 go on this spiritual quest.
###214 
###217 I think what was most odd about this flight were the
###220 flight attendants, who were all Filipino, wearing their
###224 normal Saudi flight attendant outfits, looking like they
###227 would rather have any other gig in the
###228 world than this one.
###229 
###234 We landed in Jeddah and took a bus into Mecca.
###236 And that ride into the city was one of the wilder scenes
###239 I've ever seen in my life.
###241 There were all these pilgrims coming from all directions in
###244 all kinds of vehicles.
###246 And you see them riding on the tops of cars,
###248 and vans, and buses.
###250 I remember seeing a pilgrim jumping from the roof of one
###253 bus to another.
###254 Everybody's just trying to get to the city.
###256 
###268 Mecca is not a very big city.
###270 And during the year, it's a relatively mellow place,
###273 except during the week of Hajj.
###274 The city completely transforms and half the challenge of
###278 completing your Hajj is getting all these rituals done
###281 in a very strict timeline, dealing with the fact there
###283 are about three million other people there who try to do the
###286 exact same thing at the same time.
###287 
###291 After we checked into our hotel in Mecca we walked
###294 towards the Grand Mosque, which is also
###296 known as Masjid Al-Haram.
###298 It's the holiest place in Islam.
###300 And it's a massive structure.
###302 This Moscow can hold upwards of four million people with
###305 its outdoor and indoor space, which, during Hajj, is
###308 technically the largest gathering of people in the
###312 world at any given time.
###313 This mosque is what Muslims pray towards from
###315 all over the world.
###317 And as you're walking towards it, you feel the
###319 anticipation build.
###320 People have been waiting their whole lives to
###323 come to this place.
###324 And once you enter the mosque, then you see the Kabeh.
###328 
###332 The Kabeh is a black box in the center
###334 of the Grand Mosque.
###336 And it was built around 2000 BC.
###339 And people have been praying towards it since
###341 before Islam started.
###343 And when Prophet Muhammad finally showed up, he cleaned
###346 up the place, got rid of all the idols that the pagans had
###348 been worshipping, and reordained the building as the
###351 House of God.
###352 
###358 So in the Grand Mosque, we had to do our first ritual, which
###361 is called the Tawaf, which is basically doing seven
###365 counterclockwise laps around the Kabeh.
###368 And it's kind of like being in a mosh pit with hundreds of
###373 thousands of people, but instead of it being full of
###376 angry young punk kids, we were up against aggressive
###380 Bangladeshi grandmothers.
###382 I had my parents on each arm interlocked, and we held each
###386 other as we went around the structure seven times.
###389 
###394 You're staring at the Kabeh.
###396 It's a very intense and heavy vibe.
###399 But the one thing that's a total bummer is you look up
###401 and all you see are these massive, luxury five-star
###406 hotels for the super-rich Muslims who want to pray from
###409 the confines of their room.
###410 
###427 After running around the Kabeh seven times you have to do a
###430 bunch of other rituals in order to complete your Hajj.
###432 You have five days to get it done.
###433 And it's kind of like being on a scavenger hunt.
###435 You have a checklist.
###436 You have to be smart.
###437 And you have to use strategy in order to make this happen
###440 on schedule.
###441 
###444 You have to do the Sa'i, which is walking and running back
###448 and forth between two hills.
###450 Back in the day he used to be outdoors and now it's been
###453 turned into indoor structure with two
###456 very, very long corridors.
###457 
###463 You have to spend a day at Mount Arafat.
###465 It's where the Prophet delivered
###466 his last sermon from.
###468 And you spend the day in prayer, and contemplation, and
###471 beg for forgiveness for all of your sins.
###474 It's a very important day, and, after spending the
###476 majority of it in a tent, I walked out and went in the
###480 direction of the mountain.
###481 And I walked through this wild scene with people everywhere
###486 camped out with their animals.
###487 
###493 And as I got closer to mount Arafat, it was such an
###496 incredible sight because it had been completely
###498 transformed.
###499 It looked like a snow-covered peak.
###500 
###508 Our tour group operators, before we went on this trip,
###511 gave us some guidelines.
###512 And the last point on the sheet said, be patient.
###515 Be very patient.
###517 Be very, very patient.
###519 I fully grasped the meaning of this when we had to take a
###522 three-kilometer bus ride, and it ended up
###525 taking eight hours.
###526 It was the middle of the night, and we had to collect
###529 stones, it was one of our rituals, in a place called
###531 [INAUDIBLE].
###532 And so we got off the bus.
###534 We navigated our way around sleeping bodies all over the
###537 ground, found the stones.
###539 And then it was time to pray, and so we just threw the
###543 prayer rugs down on the side of the
###545 highway and hit the mats.
###547 
###576 After picking up the stones, we got back on the bus and
###579 drove to Mina.
###580 The Valley of Mina is where the majority of
###582 the pilgrims stay.
###583 It's a tent city that fills up with, essentially, the
###586 population of Seattle for a week and then, after Hajj
###589 ends, it clears out again and goes away.
###592 It's tents as far as the eye can see.
###595 [SINGING IN PRAYER]
###602 From [INAUDIBLE]
###602 we arrived in Mina, and that's where we had to stone Satan.
###606 That's the next ritual.
###607 And this one was actually a lot of fun.
###609 You had to throw 21 stones, seven at three separate
###613 Satan-stoning stations.
###615 And I finally got to see what Satan looks like.
###618 Up until a couple years ago, Satan looked like three big
###621 pillars sticking out of a large pit.
###623 But the space wasn't big enough, and there was a
###625 stampede and people died.
###626 So the Saudi government, they built three ramps the size of
###629 a multi-lane highway, and there were three pillars
###632 inside of it that represent the devil.
###634 They're lit in shades of green.
###636 And there's a strange rumbling loud sound coming out of them.
###640 And as my dad pointed out, the whole thing made Satan look
###643 quite surreal.
###644 
###646 Before we finished the Hajj, we had to repeat some of the
###649 rituals that we'd already done.
###651 So we had to revisit Satan, throw rocks at
###653 him two more times.
###655 We had to go back to back to Mecca from Mina and do another
###658 seven counterclockwise laps.
###661 And then it was time for Eid, which marks the official end
###663 of Hajj, which is a big celebration.
###666 It's the end of the state of Irham that we've been in.
###669 And we slaughter an animal to celebrate it.
###674 And then the last thing you do is you shave your head.
###677 This is the line for the barber shop.
###680 This is the line.
###681 
###685 Soon, they will all be bald, all of these men.
###688 The barber shops in Mecca have these massive
###690 lines outside of them.
###692 And you see hundreds of thousands of baldos walking
###695 around town.
###696 And those people have all succeeded in
###698 completing their Hajj.
###699 And they're called Hajjis.
###701 
###709 Dealing with the Hajj every year is a huge logistical
###711 challenge for the Saudi government--
###713 to the point where they've actually set up
###715 a Ministry of Hajj.
###716 In the past, there have been incidents where pilgrims were
###719 trampled, when ramps collapsed and pilgrims died, and the
###723 Saudi government has invested billions of dollars to create
###726 an infrastructure to make this work, with complex crowd
###729 control techniques.
###730 And what I saw when I went last year was something that
###733 somehow manages to work.
###735 
###740 But it kind of goes without saying that bringing 3 million
###742 people into such a small place is going to bring up some
###745 complications.
###746 There's a bit of a dark side.
###748 This many people in such a small place,
###750 it really gets unwieldy.
###752 And despite the Saudi government's best efforts to
###754 deal with this profound logistical challenge, the
###756 bottom line is that there are too many people.
###758 And people need things.
###761 They need places to sleep.
###762 They need food.
###763 The need toilets.
###765 And the poor people who were there, you see them basically
###767 camped out on the side of the road for days on end.
###771 It really felt like Mecca was maxing out by the end of Hajj.
###774 And the whole scene starts looking and feeling rather
###777 apocalyptic.
###778 
###812 No matter where all these people come from.
###813 No matter what they do.
###814 And no matter how rich or poor they might be, during this
###817 pilgrimage to Mecca it felt like everyone
###819 was just the same.
###821 It was unlike any place I've ever been and unlike anything
###823 I've ever experienced.
###825 I was there standing amongst millions of people, I was
###828 there with my family, but, on some level, I felt like I all
###831 alone, on a personal trek.
###833 And everyday life felt like it was hundreds of thousands of
###836 miles away.
###838 We flew back to New York.
###839 We landed in the morning, and I went straight back to the
###841 Vice offices, which may not have been
###843 the wisests of ideas.
###845 I felt like I'd been catapulted from one end of the
###847 universe to the other.
###848
