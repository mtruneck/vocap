2
0:0:1,166 --> 0:0:2,54
MALE SPEAKER:
Welcome, everybody,


3
0:0:2,54 --> 0:0:6,16
to yet another
Authors@Google Talk.


4
0:0:6,16 --> 0:0:10,94
Today with us is best-selling
New York Times author Peter


5
0:0:10,94 --> 0:0:12,24
Singer.


6
0:0:12,24 --> 0:0:16,97
He wrote a very important
book on cyberwar.


7
0:0:16,97 --> 0:0:21,99
Our own Eric Schmidt says,
"this is an essential read."


8
0:0:21,99 --> 0:0:24,58
My dear colleagues, I
will repeat this for you.


9
0:0:24,58 --> 0:0:28,16
This is an essential read.


10
0:0:28,16 --> 0:0:32,369
So we do have copies
of the book on sale.


11
0:0:32,369 --> 0:0:35,29
This is the way it looks like.


12
0:0:35,29 --> 0:0:40,98
Please go and buy the book,
even if you've seen this talk.


13
0:0:40,98 --> 0:0:46,94
Peter is a great author
in many respects.


14
0:0:46,94 --> 0:0:50,89
But what he did for
cybersecurity and cyberwar


15
0:0:50,89 --> 0:0:53,72
for, in particular,
is he expanded


16
0:0:53,72 --> 0:0:56,92
on a field that is growing.


17
0:0:56,92 --> 0:1:1,47
And that we know is becoming
increasingly important not only


18
0:1:1,47 --> 0:1:4,209
from the infrastructure
standpoint,


19
0:1:4,209 --> 0:1:6,43
but also for
international relations.


20
0:1:6,43 --> 0:1:9,362
I'm going to let Peter
actually take it from here.


21
0:1:9,362 --> 0:1:10,7
Thank you, Peter.


22
0:1:10,7 --> 0:1:15,41



23
0:1:15,41 --> 0:1:17,77
PETER SINGER: Thank you
for the kind introduction.


24
0:1:17,77 --> 0:1:20,32
So it's a little
bit daunting to be


25
0:1:20,32 --> 0:1:23,49
talking on this topic
at a company like this,


26
0:1:23,49 --> 0:1:25,75
because I remember
the very first time


27
0:1:25,75 --> 0:1:28,53
that I ever saw a computer.


28
0:1:28,53 --> 0:1:33,14
My father took me to a science
center down in North Carolina.


29
0:1:33,14 --> 0:1:37,49
And I got to see a Commodore,
if you remember those.


30
0:1:37,49 --> 0:1:41,51
And I took a class
on how to program,


31
0:1:41,51 --> 0:1:45,44
learning an entire new
language for the sole purpose


32
0:1:45,44 --> 0:1:51,8
of making a smiley face out of
the letter m that printed out


33
0:1:51,8 --> 0:1:53,62
on one of those
old spool printers


34
0:1:53,62 --> 0:1:55,945
that you tore the perforated
paper off the sides.


35
0:1:55,945 --> 0:1:57,53
Remember that?


36
0:1:57,53 --> 0:2:3,2
Now since then, the centrality
of computers to my life,


37
0:2:3,2 --> 0:2:5,3
your life, the
entire world, it's


38
0:2:5,3 --> 0:2:7,33
almost impossible to fathom.


39
0:2:7,33 --> 0:2:10,949
We live in a world where
more than 40 trillion emails


40
0:2:10,949 --> 0:2:14,3
are sent every single year.


41
0:2:14,3 --> 0:2:17,15
The first website
was made in 1991.


42
0:2:17,15 --> 0:2:19,5
Now, according to
your own analytics,


43
0:2:19,5 --> 0:2:23,31
there's more than 30 trillion
individual web pages out there.


44
0:2:23,31 --> 0:2:25,11
Moreover, the
internet is not just


45
0:2:25,11 --> 0:2:28,57
about compiling and
sharing information.


46
0:2:28,57 --> 0:2:32,19
It's also having impact out on
the real world via the emerging


47
0:2:32,19 --> 0:2:33,64
Internet of Things.


48
0:2:33,64 --> 0:2:37,1
According to Cisco, we'll see
more than 40 billion devices


49
0:2:37,1 --> 0:2:39,41
internet-enabled over
the next five years,


50
0:2:39,41 --> 0:2:44,55
as everything from thermostats
to cars to refrigerators


51
0:2:44,55 --> 0:2:48,21
to technologies literally not
yet invented or imagined all


52
0:2:48,21 --> 0:2:49,75
come online and
all start to carry


53
0:2:49,75 --> 0:2:52,5
on conversations without us.


54
0:2:52,5 --> 0:2:57,12
So in short, domains that range
from communication to commerce


55
0:2:57,12 --> 0:3:0,8
to critical infrastructure
to even conflict.


56
0:3:0,8 --> 0:3:2,67
98% of US military
communications


57
0:3:2,67 --> 0:3:5,26
goes over the civilian-owned
and operated internet.


58
0:3:5,26 --> 0:3:8,15
All of these spaces
are dependent on it.


59
0:3:8,15 --> 0:3:10,81
So we're in an age
of cyber dependency.


60
0:3:10,81 --> 0:3:13,82
But in the short
history of the internet,


61
0:3:13,82 --> 0:3:18,91
I would argue that we've reached
a critical turning point.


62
0:3:18,91 --> 0:3:22,16
And it's because while the
positive side of cyberspace


63
0:3:22,16 --> 0:3:25,317
is rippling out, so too are
the risks, the negative side.


64
0:3:25,317 --> 0:3:27,4
There's all sorts of ways
you can illustrate this.


65
0:3:27,4 --> 0:3:30,49
You can illustrate it
with the raw numbers.


66
0:3:30,49 --> 0:3:34,89
Every second, nine new pieces
of malware are discovered.


67
0:3:34,89 --> 0:3:39,86
97% of Fortune 500 companies
know that they've been hacked.


68
0:3:39,86 --> 0:3:42,1
And the other 3% have
been, too, they just


69
0:3:42,1 --> 0:3:44,4
aren't willing to
admit it to themselves.


70
0:3:44,4 --> 0:3:48,38
More than 100 governments
have created some kind


71
0:3:48,38 --> 0:3:53,8
of cyber military command, some
kind of military unit designed


72
0:3:53,8 --> 0:3:56,8
to fight and win wars in
cyberspace and beyond.


73
0:3:56,8 --> 0:4:0,45
And indeed, the very first
Pew poll to kick off 2014


74
0:4:0,45 --> 0:4:4,49
found that Americans are
more afraid of a cyber attack


75
0:4:4,49 --> 0:4:7,8
than they are of North
Korean nuclear weapons,


76
0:4:7,8 --> 0:4:11,6
Iranian nuclear weapons,
the rise of China, Russia,


77
0:4:11,6 --> 0:4:13,47
or climate change.


78
0:4:13,47 --> 0:4:15,61
So these fears,
they've coalesced


79
0:4:15,61 --> 0:4:17,95
into one of the most
rapidly growing industries


80
0:4:17,95 --> 0:4:19,32
in the entire world.


81
0:4:19,32 --> 0:4:23,84
They've also driven a
massive bureaucratic growth


82
0:4:23,84 --> 0:4:25,84
at the national
governmental level


83
0:4:25,84 --> 0:4:27,9
not just in the United States.


84
0:4:27,9 --> 0:4:28,59
Just earlier today,
France announced


85
0:4:28,59 --> 0:4:30,54
that it was spending
another $2 billion


86
0:4:30,54 --> 0:4:34,15
in its military on cybersecurity
issues and cyberwar.


87
0:4:34,15 --> 0:4:36,85
But also we see it
at the state level.


88
0:4:36,85 --> 0:4:38,8
And even at the
local level, where


89
0:4:38,8 --> 0:4:40,92
you see cities like Los
Angeles, for example,


90
0:4:40,92 --> 0:4:44,24
creating cybersecurity centers.


91
0:4:44,24 --> 0:4:48,27
What all this together means
is that for all the hope


92
0:4:48,27 --> 0:4:51,55
and promise of the
new digital age,


93
0:4:51,55 --> 0:4:55,66
we also live in an era
of cyber insecurity,


94
0:4:55,66 --> 0:4:57,8
if we're really being
honest about it.


95
0:4:57,8 --> 0:4:59,342
And so before I go
much further, it's


96
0:4:59,342 --> 0:5:0,883
at this point I'm
going to try and do


97
0:5:0,883 --> 0:5:2,89
something that's a little
bit counterintuitive,


98
0:5:2,89 --> 0:5:7,38
but will maybe help make that
point about cyber insecurity.


99
0:5:7,38 --> 0:5:10,1
And a lot like the
challenge of trying


100
0:5:10,1 --> 0:5:12,16
to write a book
about cybersecurity


101
0:5:12,16 --> 0:5:14,21
and make it
interesting, you also


102
0:5:14,21 --> 0:5:16,6
have the challenge of how
do you give a talk about it


103
0:5:16,6 --> 0:5:19,0
and give visuals that
make it interesting.


104
0:5:19,0 --> 0:5:22,15
So what I did-- and
with Boris's help,


105
0:5:22,15 --> 0:5:23,63
hopefully it will
play for us here


106
0:5:23,63 --> 0:5:25,53
--is I've assembled
what I think are


107
0:5:25,53 --> 0:5:29,21
some of the best
illustrations of cyberwar art,


108
0:5:29,21 --> 0:5:31,457
and some of the worst
illustrations of it.


109
0:5:31,457 --> 0:5:33,4
And it's going to
play in front of me.


110
0:5:33,4 --> 0:5:33,54
I'm not going to speak to it.


111
0:5:33,54 --> 0:5:36,25
It's just going to continue
to flash for a couple reasons.


112
0:5:36,25 --> 0:5:40,42
One, to tell that story
of cyber insecurity.


113
0:5:40,42 --> 0:5:43,4
But also because data
has found that you're


114
0:5:43,4 --> 0:5:45,87
60% more likely
to retain what I'm


115
0:5:45,87 --> 0:5:47,84
saying if you look at a picture.


116
0:5:47,84 --> 0:5:50,75
Even if the picture has nothing
to do with what I'm saying,


117
0:5:50,75 --> 0:5:53,1
it's just the way
us humans work.


118
0:5:53,1 --> 0:5:54,76
And that actually goes
to a broader lesson


119
0:5:54,76 --> 0:5:56,79
that the book explores, and
we'll talk about it later on.


120
0:5:56,79 --> 0:5:59,33
Which is that we're humans,
we're strange, we're weird,


121
0:5:59,33 --> 0:6:1,68
but that's what drives
all of these things.


122
0:6:1,68 --> 0:6:4,66
So let's pull back on
all this and wrestle


123
0:6:4,66 --> 0:6:9,12
with the question of why a book
on cybersecurity and cyberwar,


124
0:6:9,12 --> 0:6:11,3
and why now?


125
0:6:11,3 --> 0:6:14,17
There's two quotes
that motivated


126
0:6:14,17 --> 0:6:17,26
me that basically
encapsulate this.


127
0:6:17,26 --> 0:6:19,13
The first is from
President Obama,


128
0:6:19,13 --> 0:6:22,9
who declared that
cybersecurity risks pose quote,


129
0:6:22,9 --> 0:6:25,1
"The most serious economic
and national security


130
0:6:25,1 --> 0:6:27,86
challenges of the 21st century."


131
0:6:27,86 --> 0:6:30,75
The second quote is from
the former CIA director,


132
0:6:30,75 --> 0:6:34,99
who said quote, "Rarely has
something been so important


133
0:6:34,99 --> 0:6:39,34
and so talked about with less
and less clarity and less


134
0:6:39,34 --> 0:6:41,88
apparent understanding."


135
0:6:41,88 --> 0:6:44,43
And you can see, I really
do want to talk to this one,


136
0:6:44,43 --> 0:6:46,19
but we'll keep moving on.


137
0:6:46,19 --> 0:6:49,45
So let's explore this gap.


138
0:6:49,45 --> 0:6:51,75
We see it in all
sorts of fields.


139
0:6:51,75 --> 0:6:56,24
From the 70% of
business executives--


140
0:6:56,24 --> 0:7:0,39
not 70% of CTOs,
CSOs, CIOs --but 70%


141
0:7:0,39 --> 0:7:4,27
of business executives in
general, in any industry, who


142
0:7:4,27 --> 0:7:7,88
have made a cybersecurity
decision for their company


143
0:7:7,88 --> 0:7:11,46
despite the fact that no
major MBA program teaches it


144
0:7:11,46 --> 0:7:13,55
as part of your normal
business management


145
0:7:13,55 --> 0:7:15,53
training and responsibility.


146
0:7:15,53 --> 0:7:17,1
That same kind of
gap in training


147
0:7:17,1 --> 0:7:20,66
happens at the schools we teach
our diplomats, our lawyers,


148
0:7:20,66 --> 0:7:23,98
our journalists, our generals.


149
0:7:23,98 --> 0:7:25,87
Or anecdotes.


150
0:7:25,87 --> 0:7:28,8
And there's just
an array of funny,


151
0:7:28,8 --> 0:7:29,92
but in a certain way
sad, anecdotes that


152
0:7:29,92 --> 0:7:30,78
populate the book.


153
0:7:30,78 --> 0:7:33,41
From the opening of the book
where a Pentagon official is


154
0:7:33,41 --> 0:7:36,1
telling us how
important this all is,


155
0:7:36,1 --> 0:7:39,55
but he describes it
as "this cyber stuff."


156
0:7:39,55 --> 0:7:41,41
When you can only
call something stuff,


157
0:7:41,41 --> 0:7:42,97
but you know it's
important, that's


158
0:7:42,97 --> 0:7:44,58
not a good place to be in.


159
0:7:44,58 --> 0:7:49,24
Or the former Secretary
of Homeland Security,


160
0:7:49,24 --> 0:7:52,85
the agency that is ostensibly
in charge of cybersecurity


161
0:7:52,85 --> 0:7:54,82
on the civilian side
for the United States--


162
0:7:54,82 --> 0:7:57,444
who has actually now taken over
as Chancellor of the university


163
0:7:57,444 --> 0:8:0,1
system out here in California
--who proudly talked


164
0:8:0,1 --> 0:8:4,57
to us about the fact that
she doesn't use email.


165
0:8:4,57 --> 0:8:8,8
And in fact hasn't used social
media for over a decade.


166
0:8:8,8 --> 0:8:11,28
Not because she doesn't
think it's secure,


167
0:8:11,28 --> 0:8:14,57
but because she just
doesn't think it's useful.


168
0:8:14,57 --> 0:8:18,78
That same phenomena is happening
on the Judicial Branch.


169
0:8:18,78 --> 0:8:21,0
Where, for example, a
Supreme Court Justice


170
0:8:21,0 --> 0:8:23,25
talked about how they
quote, "Hadn't yet


171
0:8:23,25 --> 0:8:25,5
gotten around to email."


172
0:8:25,5 --> 0:8:27,304
Now this is obviously
worrisome to folks


173
0:8:27,304 --> 0:8:28,72
here working on
the Gmail account.


174
0:8:28,72 --> 0:8:30,55
But there's a broader
question of what


175
0:8:30,55 --> 0:8:33,11
does this mean for Justices
that in the upcoming year


176
0:8:33,11 --> 0:8:36,169
are going to decide everything
from maybe net neutrality


177
0:8:36,169 --> 0:8:38,61
questions to the legalities
of some of the things


178
0:8:38,61 --> 0:8:41,85
that the NSA was doing when they
just haven't yet gotten around


179
0:8:41,85 --> 0:8:43,71
to email.


180
0:8:43,71 --> 0:8:48,12
The cyber stuff problem is not
just an American phenomenon.


181
0:8:48,12 --> 0:8:50,28
We saw the same
thing in meetings


182
0:8:50,28 --> 0:8:55,4
with leaders in China,
UAE, France, Great Britain.


183
0:8:55,4 --> 0:8:59,16
The Head of Cybersecurity
in Australia


184
0:8:59,16 --> 0:9:2,22
had never heard
of Tor, obviously


185
0:9:2,22 --> 0:9:5,24
a critical technology
in this space.


186
0:9:5,24 --> 0:9:7,81
Now the result is
that cybersecurity


187
0:9:7,81 --> 0:9:11,98
is as crucial to areas as
intimate as your personal


188
0:9:11,98 --> 0:9:15,1
privacy, to the security
of your bank account,


189
0:9:15,1 --> 0:9:18,67
to as weighty as the future
of world politics itself.


190
0:9:18,67 --> 0:9:22,4
But it's been
treated as an issue


191
0:9:22,4 --> 0:9:27,25
only for the "it"
crowd, for the IT folks.


192
0:9:27,25 --> 0:9:30,5
In turn, the technical
community that


193
0:9:30,5 --> 0:9:35,55
understands the workings of
the software and the hardware


194
0:9:35,55 --> 0:9:38,75
hasn't dealt very
well with the wetware,


195
0:9:38,75 --> 0:9:40,49
with the human side,
and particularly


196
0:9:40,49 --> 0:9:43,14
the ripple effects of
this into other worlds,


197
0:9:43,14 --> 0:9:46,1
be it policy, law,
war, you name it.


198
0:9:46,1 --> 0:9:47,45
They've often
looked at the world


199
0:9:47,45 --> 0:9:49,75
through a very specific
lens and failed


200
0:9:49,75 --> 0:9:52,32
to appreciate some of the
broader pictures out there.


201
0:9:52,32 --> 0:9:54,48
Now the dangers of
this are diverse.


202
0:9:54,48 --> 0:9:56,92
Each of us, in whatever
role we play in life,


203
0:9:56,92 --> 0:9:59,21
must make decisions
about cybersecurity


204
0:9:59,21 --> 0:10:1,29
that shape the future
of the world well


205
0:10:1,29 --> 0:10:3,35
beyond just the online world.


206
0:10:3,35 --> 0:10:7,9
But too often we do so
without the proper tools.


207
0:10:7,9 --> 0:10:11,58
Basic terms and
essential definitions


208
0:10:11,58 --> 0:10:17,8
that define both what's
possible but also what's proper,


209
0:10:17,8 --> 0:10:23,16
what's right and wrong, are
missed or even worse distorted.


210
0:10:23,16 --> 0:10:27,74
Past myth and future hype
often weave together,


211
0:10:27,74 --> 0:10:31,93
obscuring what actually happened
with where we really are now.


212
0:10:31,93 --> 0:10:35,98
And so the result is that
some threats are overblown


213
0:10:35,98 --> 0:10:40,83
and overreacted to, and
other threats are ignored.


214
0:10:40,83 --> 0:10:43,34
So for example, as
someone who loves history,


215
0:10:43,34 --> 0:10:47,15
it absolutely pains
me when I hear


216
0:10:47,15 --> 0:10:48,69
people-- and people
who have done


217
0:10:48,69 --> 0:10:51,45
this range from senior
government leaders


218
0:10:51,45 --> 0:10:54,97
like senators to generals
to prominent news columnists


219
0:10:54,97 --> 0:10:58,83
--describe how we are in a
parallel to the Cold War.


220
0:10:58,83 --> 0:11:0,69
Or as a cabinet
official told me,


221
0:11:0,69 --> 0:11:4,85
that malware was
"just like a WMD."


222
0:11:4,85 --> 0:11:5,71
And that's why we
needed to approach it


223
0:11:5,71 --> 0:11:7,251
in the same kind of
deterrence theory


224
0:11:7,251 --> 0:11:9,4
that we used in the Cold War.


225
0:11:9,4 --> 0:11:11,2
What these people
fail to appreciate


226
0:11:11,2 --> 0:11:13,54
is the parallel to
the Cold War is not


227
0:11:13,54 --> 0:11:16,58
the one they think
they're making.


228
0:11:16,58 --> 0:11:18,33
If you understand
both the historic side


229
0:11:18,33 --> 0:11:20,72
and the technical side, the
best parallel to the Cold


230
0:11:20,72 --> 0:11:23,3
War-- actually,
those early days we


231
0:11:23,3 --> 0:11:26,48
didn't understand well either
the technology but even more so


232
0:11:26,48 --> 0:11:30,13
the political dynamics that it
was driving, the period of time


233
0:11:30,13 --> 0:11:34,26
where we took the real life
versions of Dr. Strangelove


234
0:11:34,26 --> 0:11:35,47
seriously.


235
0:11:35,47 --> 0:11:37,58
So as an illustration
in the book,


236
0:11:37,58 --> 0:11:41,78
we explore the episode where
the US Air Force actually


237
0:11:41,78 --> 0:11:45,9
had a serious plan
to nuke the moon


238
0:11:45,9 --> 0:11:46,69
to show the Soviets
that we could


239
0:11:46,69 --> 0:11:49,41
do interesting
stuff in space, too.


240
0:11:49,41 --> 0:11:51,54
Those are not historic lessons
we should be drawing in terms


241
0:11:51,54 --> 0:11:52,68
of the how-to's.


242
0:11:52,68 --> 0:11:55,76
But that's often what
the discourse is.


243
0:11:55,76 --> 0:11:57,83
Let me go into some
of the manifestations


244
0:11:57,83 --> 0:12:2,66
of this disconnect, and how they
play out, and why they matter.


245
0:12:2,66 --> 0:12:6,64
One in particular is that we
often lump things together


246
0:12:6,64 --> 0:12:11,28
that are unlike, simply because
they involve zeros and ones.


247
0:12:11,28 --> 0:12:14,82
So take that idea
of a cyber attack.


248
0:12:14,82 --> 0:12:17,91
General Alexander,
who is simultaneously


249
0:12:17,91 --> 0:12:22,51
the commander of US military
Cyber Command and double-hatted


250
0:12:22,51 --> 0:12:25,27
as the head of the
NSA-- which there


251
0:12:25,27 --> 0:12:28,13
are some very interesting
problems with that.


252
0:12:28,13 --> 0:12:29,81
But let's move beyond that.


253
0:12:29,81 --> 0:12:33,44
He testified to Congress,
quote, "Every day,


254
0:12:33,44 --> 0:12:38,79
America's armed forces face
millions of cyber attacks."


255
0:12:38,79 --> 0:12:42,17
But to get those
numbers he was combining


256
0:12:42,17 --> 0:12:45,8
a variety of like
and unlike things.


257
0:12:45,8 --> 0:12:49,72
He was combining everything from
probes and address scans that


258
0:12:49,72 --> 0:12:53,24
never entered networks
to unsuccessful attempts


259
0:12:53,24 --> 0:12:57,91
to get in that ranged from kids
carrying out pranks to attempts


260
0:12:57,91 --> 0:13:1,0
at political protests to
attempts to get in to carry out


261
0:13:1,0 --> 0:13:5,6
some kind of theft
or active espionage.


262
0:13:5,6 --> 0:13:10,68
But none of those millions of
attacks was what his listeners


263
0:13:10,68 --> 0:13:13,98
in Congress thought
he was talking about,


264
0:13:13,98 --> 0:13:17,6
which was the so-called
cyber-Pearl Harbor


265
0:13:17,6 --> 0:13:21,25
or cyber-9/11 that actually
there's been over a half


266
0:13:21,25 --> 0:13:25,241
million media and government
speech references to.


267
0:13:25,241 --> 0:13:27,24
And that's what his boss
as Secretary of Defense


268
0:13:27,24 --> 0:13:29,1
was warning everyone about.


269
0:13:29,1 --> 0:13:32,2
Essentially what we're doing
is that we're bundling together


270
0:13:32,2 --> 0:13:36,28
all of these activities simply
because they involve software.


271
0:13:36,28 --> 0:13:38,86
Which would be a lot
like bundling together


272
0:13:38,86 --> 0:13:43,54
the activities of a group of
teenagers with firecrackers,


273
0:13:43,54 --> 0:13:46,15
a group of political protesters
in the street with a smoke


274
0:13:46,15 --> 0:13:50,76
bomb, James Bond with
his Walther PPK missile,


275
0:13:50,76 --> 0:13:53,35
a terrorist with
a roadside bomb,


276
0:13:53,35 --> 0:13:55,6
and a Russian cruise missile,
and saying these are all


277
0:13:55,6 --> 0:13:59,78
the same because they involve
the chemistry of gunpowder.


278
0:13:59,78 --> 0:14:1,92
We've bundled them together
on the digital side,


279
0:14:1,92 --> 0:14:3,85
because they all
involve the internet.


280
0:14:3,85 --> 0:14:6,56
Or take the organizations.


281
0:14:6,56 --> 0:14:8,78
I had a senior US
military official


282
0:14:8,78 --> 0:14:14,51
argue with me that Anonymous and
Al Qaeda were the same thing.


283
0:14:14,51 --> 0:14:19,9
Now, however you come down on
Anonymous-- and I'm actually,


284
0:14:19,9 --> 0:14:23,14
I guess far more
empathetic towards them


285
0:14:23,14 --> 0:14:26,34
than what you'd expect
from people coming from DC.


286
0:14:26,34 --> 0:14:29,55
But the bottom line is,
wherever you come down on them,


287
0:14:29,55 --> 0:14:33,42
they have nothing to do
with Al Qaeda in terms


288
0:14:33,42 --> 0:14:37,22
of their organization,
their means, their ends,


289
0:14:37,22 --> 0:14:40,0
their causes-- basically the
only thing they're related


290
0:14:40,0 --> 0:14:42,82
is they're both non-state actors
that begin with the letter A.


291
0:14:42,82 --> 0:14:44,99
But that was the belief.


292
0:14:44,99 --> 0:14:47,44
Now these gaps in
understanding, these disconnects


293
0:14:47,44 --> 0:14:50,46
of policy and reality, mean
that we're not only seeing


294
0:14:50,46 --> 0:14:52,93
growing tension--
and we explore this


295
0:14:52,93 --> 0:14:55,745
in particular in meetings
with US and Chinese officials


296
0:14:55,745 --> 0:14:59,87
who would be negotiating on
core questions of cybersecurity.


297
0:14:59,87 --> 0:15:4,18
And yet, as an illustration,
one State Department official


298
0:15:4,18 --> 0:15:6,48
going off to one of these
negotiations actually


299
0:15:6,48 --> 0:15:9,89
asked us what an ISP was?


300
0:15:9,89 --> 0:15:11,642
Which to make that
Cold War parallel,


301
0:15:11,642 --> 0:15:13,85
would be like going off to
negotiate with the Soviets


302
0:15:13,85 --> 0:15:15,9
and not knowing what an ICBM is.


303
0:15:15,9 --> 0:15:18,65
But the point is, it's
not only driving tension,


304
0:15:18,65 --> 0:15:21,91
it's leading to us being
taken advantage of.


305
0:15:21,91 --> 0:15:25,39
And that can happen at
the individual level


306
0:15:25,39 --> 0:15:29,84
when you get tricked to send
your mom your bank account


307
0:15:29,84 --> 0:15:31,99
information because
she's stuck in Thailand.


308
0:15:31,99 --> 0:15:33,5
You didn't know she
was in Thailand,


309
0:15:33,5 --> 0:15:35,63
but gosh, you just
need to help her out.


310
0:15:35,63 --> 0:15:37,75
To more serious
illustrations of this.


311
0:15:37,75 --> 0:15:41,21
Like at the G-20 conference,
the most important


312
0:15:41,21 --> 0:15:43,4
international
conference of the year,


313
0:15:43,4 --> 0:15:48,94
diplomats were spearphished
by-- they received an email that


314
0:15:48,94 --> 0:15:50,74
had a wonderful offer for them.


315
0:15:50,74 --> 0:15:52,23
It said, if you
click this link you


316
0:15:52,23 --> 0:15:57,14
will be able to see nude photos
of the French First Lady.


317
0:15:57,14 --> 0:15:59,986
And many of these senior
diplomats clicked the link.


318
0:15:59,986 --> 0:16:2,36
And unfortunately they didn't
get to see the nude photos,


319
0:16:2,36 --> 0:16:5,86
but they did download
spyware onto their accounts.


320
0:16:5,86 --> 0:16:8,45
Again, senior
government officials


321
0:16:8,45 --> 0:16:10,52
to being taken advantage
of at the business


322
0:16:10,52 --> 0:16:12,32
organizational level.


323
0:16:12,32 --> 0:16:16,8
Either alternatively not doing
enough to protect the business


324
0:16:16,8 --> 0:16:24,54
or hiring hucksters
who offer 100% security


325
0:16:24,54 --> 0:16:28,74
with some kind of
silver bullet solution.


326
0:16:28,74 --> 0:16:30,28
Or frankly, being
taken advantage


327
0:16:30,28 --> 0:16:31,88
of at the national
political level.


328
0:16:31,88 --> 0:16:33,94
Which is, I think, behind
a number of the issues


329
0:16:33,94 --> 0:16:38,9
surrounding the current
Snowden-NSA scandal.


330
0:16:38,9 --> 0:16:39,98
This can even happen
to a president.


331
0:16:39,98 --> 0:16:42,33
Reportedly, Obama
expressed his, quote,


332
0:16:42,33 --> 0:16:45,4
"frustration that the
complexity of the technology


333
0:16:45,4 --> 0:16:48,14
was overwhelming policymakers."


334
0:16:48,14 --> 0:16:53,44
Now, our inability to have
a proper discussion on these


335
0:16:53,44 --> 0:16:58,42
means that we see a
distortion of threats.


336
0:16:58,42 --> 0:17:2,77
And in turn, a misapplication
of resources to face them.


337
0:17:2,77 --> 0:17:8,599
Perhaps the best illustration
of this is a number-- 31,300.


338
0:17:8,599 --> 0:17:13,5
That's the number of news
and academic journal articles


339
0:17:13,5 --> 0:17:17,589
that have explored the
phenomenon of cyberterrorism.


340
0:17:17,589 --> 0:17:19,4
Zero.


341
0:17:19,4 --> 0:17:20,92
That's the number of
people that have actually


342
0:17:20,92 --> 0:17:25,907
been hurt or killed by an actual
incident of cyberterrorism.


343
0:17:25,907 --> 0:17:27,49
In the book, we joke
that in many ways


344
0:17:27,49 --> 0:17:30,47
cyberterrorism is a lot like
Discovery Channel's Shark


345
0:17:30,47 --> 0:17:33,73
Week, where we obsess
about the danger of sharks


346
0:17:33,73 --> 0:17:35,87
even though you're 15,000
times more likely to be


347
0:17:35,87 --> 0:17:37,37
hurt on your toilet.


348
0:17:37,37 --> 0:17:41,1
Except the difference is that
Jaws actually did get someone,


349
0:17:41,1 --> 0:17:43,52
or the real world version
of Jaws did get someone.


350
0:17:43,52 --> 0:17:46,33
Whereas we've not seen
this in reality yet


351
0:17:46,33 --> 0:17:48,3
other than Die Hard 4.


352
0:17:48,3 --> 0:17:52,62
Now let me be clear,
I'm not saying


353
0:17:52,62 --> 0:17:56,67
that terrorists don't
use the internet.


354
0:17:56,67 --> 0:17:58,63
And in the book we
have several chapters


355
0:17:58,63 --> 0:18:0,671
that explore terrorists'
use of it, much of which


356
0:18:0,671 --> 0:18:2,5
is like how the
rest of us use it.


357
0:18:2,5 --> 0:18:5,32
And I'm not saying that there
is not interest in carrying out


358
0:18:5,32 --> 0:18:8,49
acts of cyberterrorism,
nor that there


359
0:18:8,49 --> 0:18:11,36
wouldn't be impactful
effects of them.


360
0:18:11,36 --> 0:18:13,83
Indeed, our
development of Stuxnet,


361
0:18:13,83 --> 0:18:17,177
a cyber weapon that finally
had physical powers, caused


362
0:18:17,177 --> 0:18:19,76
physical damage to the world,
is a great illustration of this.


363
0:18:19,76 --> 0:18:24,17
But in turn, Stuxnet illustrates
how an effective cyber attack


364
0:18:24,17 --> 0:18:29,6
that is real and consequential
is also quite difficult.


365
0:18:29,6 --> 0:18:34,34
To put it a different way, when
it comes to cyberterrorism Al


366
0:18:34,34 --> 0:18:38,23
Qaeda would like to, but can't.


367
0:18:38,23 --> 0:18:42,88
China could, but
doesn't want to yet.


368
0:18:42,88 --> 0:18:46,68
Now my point, rather,
is that strategy--


369
0:18:46,68 --> 0:18:50,27
whether it's at the national
level, at the business level,


370
0:18:50,27 --> 0:18:52,59
at the individual
level, strategy


371
0:18:52,59 --> 0:18:55,89
is about choices and priorities.


372
0:18:55,89 --> 0:18:58,76
And so we need to weigh
the centrality of what


373
0:18:58,76 --> 0:19:2,83
we talk about, what we obsess
about in our discussions


374
0:19:2,83 --> 0:19:7,68
versus what are arguably
not only very real, but more


375
0:19:7,68 --> 0:19:10,49
consequential cyber
threats out there.


376
0:19:10,49 --> 0:19:13,21
It ranges from something
that this organization


377
0:19:13,21 --> 0:19:16,43
is very familiar with--
the massive campaign


378
0:19:16,43 --> 0:19:21,27
of intellectual property
theft that by most measures


379
0:19:21,27 --> 0:19:24,26
you could judge to be
the largest theft in all


380
0:19:24,26 --> 0:19:28,18
of human history, that's
ongoing right now.


381
0:19:28,18 --> 0:19:30,25
And where is it coming from?


382
0:19:30,25 --> 0:19:31,76
If this was a
Harry Potter novel,


383
0:19:31,76 --> 0:19:33,63
we would describe it
as a large Asian power


384
0:19:33,63 --> 0:19:35,32
that shall not be named.


385
0:19:35,32 --> 0:19:37,82
To if we want to think
about the national security


386
0:19:37,82 --> 0:19:41,5
consequences-- not just looking
at the consequences of that IP


387
0:19:41,5 --> 0:19:43,58
theft and how it
plays out, but look


388
0:19:43,58 --> 0:19:47,8
beyond the sexy cyber-Pearl
Harbor descriptions


389
0:19:47,8 --> 0:19:51,17
and actually focus on how the
military uses this technology


390
0:19:51,17 --> 0:19:51,85
and wants to use it.


391
0:19:51,85 --> 0:19:55,5
And what is the future of
computer network operations


392
0:19:55,5 --> 0:19:57,99
in actual campaigns of warfare?


393
0:19:57,99 --> 0:20:0,43
To maybe moreso we should
be paying attention


394
0:20:0,43 --> 0:20:3,82
to the ripple effects, the
secondary effects of all


395
0:20:3,82 --> 0:20:4,86
these actions.


396
0:20:4,86 --> 0:20:7,71
Because if we use the
illustration of terrorism,


397
0:20:7,71 --> 0:20:9,49
one of the things
we've learned from 9/11


398
0:20:9,49 --> 0:20:12,38
is it's not merely
the attack itself,


399
0:20:12,38 --> 0:20:15,36
but how we react
to it that really


400
0:20:15,36 --> 0:20:17,36
stakes its place in history.


401
0:20:17,36 --> 0:20:20,7
And so I worry about some
of these secondary effects


402
0:20:20,7 --> 0:20:22,49
that are playing
out, and particularly


403
0:20:22,49 --> 0:20:26,93
how they are hammering away
at that crucial value that


404
0:20:26,93 --> 0:20:30,12
has basically underpinned
the internet of trust.


405
0:20:30,12 --> 0:20:31,94
And we can see
that being damaged


406
0:20:31,94 --> 0:20:34,64
by the massive campaigns
of cyber crime out there.


407
0:20:34,64 --> 0:20:37,42
Whether it's the IP theft
to credit card, and like.


408
0:20:37,42 --> 0:20:41,93
And that's affecting both trust
that consumers and users have


409
0:20:41,93 --> 0:20:44,46
with the network, and in
turn what the operators have


410
0:20:44,46 --> 0:20:45,88
towards consumers.


411
0:20:45,88 --> 0:20:50,78
To trust damaged by our
government's actions seeking


412
0:20:50,78 --> 0:20:54,27
to deal with
conventional terrorism.


413
0:20:54,27 --> 0:20:58,58
And what that has done to
both trust in those agencies,


414
0:20:58,58 --> 0:21:1,49
but also trust in America and
trust in American technology


415
0:21:1,49 --> 0:21:2,89
companies.


416
0:21:2,89 --> 0:21:6,71
To finally, what it's done to
the internet freedom agenda.


417
0:21:6,71 --> 0:21:9,21
And the trust in the
underlying governance structure


418
0:21:9,21 --> 0:21:11,79
of the internet that has
worked so effectively


419
0:21:11,79 --> 0:21:13,64
for our lifetime,
created this thing


420
0:21:13,64 --> 0:21:16,69
that's been arguably
the most powerful force


421
0:21:16,69 --> 0:21:20,19
for political,
economic, social change


422
0:21:20,19 --> 0:21:22,6
certainly in my
lifetime, maybe ever.


423
0:21:22,6 --> 0:21:24,515
And yet over the next year
could be seriously damaged


424
0:21:24,515 --> 0:21:26,14
by some international
negotiations that


425
0:21:26,14 --> 0:21:28,17
are playing out,
particularly pushed


426
0:21:28,17 --> 0:21:31,25
by authoritarian states
like Russia and China.


427
0:21:31,25 --> 0:21:36,65
If you like the idea of Russia's
82,000 blacklisted websites,


428
0:21:36,65 --> 0:21:41,246
or if you like the building
internet wall in China,


429
0:21:41,246 --> 0:21:43,12
this may be the future
if we don't watch out.


430
0:21:43,12 --> 0:21:44,9
Particularly as some
of the core swing


431
0:21:44,9 --> 0:21:47,43
states, the Brazils, the
Indias, the Germanys,


432
0:21:47,43 --> 0:21:50,38
may not be with us the
way they were previously.


433
0:21:50,38 --> 0:21:54,35
Now this gap in the
fields also means


434
0:21:54,35 --> 0:21:57,23
when it comes to
the warfare side,


435
0:21:57,23 --> 0:22:0,91
we act on bad assumptions.


436
0:22:0,91 --> 0:22:3,62
Or don't make connections
across domains


437
0:22:3,62 --> 0:22:5,42
in ways that truly matter.


438
0:22:5,42 --> 0:22:7,34
So take the notion of
something from the field


439
0:22:7,34 --> 0:22:9,84
of war applied here,
which is offense, defense,


440
0:22:9,84 --> 0:22:11,72
the balance between these.


441
0:22:11,72 --> 0:22:15,68
There is an idea that's taken
hold that cyber offense is


442
0:22:15,68 --> 0:22:17,3
inherently privileged.


443
0:22:17,3 --> 0:22:19,5
It's inherently dominant
against the defense.


444
0:22:19,5 --> 0:22:22,58
And not just now, but as
one US military report


445
0:22:22,58 --> 0:22:25,65
put it, quote, "For the
foreseeable future."


446
0:22:25,65 --> 0:22:28,85
So for as long as we can see
in the future cyber offense


447
0:22:28,85 --> 0:22:31,93
will be dominant, is the
assumption that's out there.


448
0:22:31,93 --> 0:22:34,8
This in turn has
driven the US military


449
0:22:34,8 --> 0:22:38,74
to spend roughly
four times as much


450
0:22:38,74 --> 0:22:41,84
on cyber offense
research and development


451
0:22:41,84 --> 0:22:45,48
as it has on cyber defense
research and development.


452
0:22:45,48 --> 0:22:48,29
Now the problem with
this is threefold.


453
0:22:48,29 --> 0:22:52,24
The first is that it
cyber offense is not


454
0:22:52,24 --> 0:22:55,5
as easy as it's
too often depicted.


455
0:22:55,5 --> 0:22:58,55
So for example, the former
number two in the Pentagon


456
0:22:58,55 --> 0:23:1,93
described how, quote, "A
couple of teenagers sitting


457
0:23:1,93 --> 0:23:4,48
in their parents'
basement, sipping Red Bull


458
0:23:4,48 --> 0:23:10,41
and wearing flip-flops, could
carry out a WMD-style attack."


459
0:23:10,41 --> 0:23:11,4
No.


460
0:23:11,4 --> 0:23:12,3
They couldn't.


461
0:23:12,3 --> 0:23:15,94
They could do a lot of
things, but not what he's


462
0:23:15,94 --> 0:23:17,12
for portraying.


463
0:23:17,12 --> 0:23:19,81
And Stuxnet is a great
illustration of that.


464
0:23:19,81 --> 0:23:22,14
In terms of the wide
variety of skill sets


465
0:23:22,14 --> 0:23:24,93
that were involved in this,
everything from intelligence


466
0:23:24,93 --> 0:23:28,7
analysts and collection to some
of the top technical talent


467
0:23:28,7 --> 0:23:31,71
in the world from multiple
nations, to nuclear physicists,


468
0:23:31,71 --> 0:23:35,57
to engineers, to then another
espionage effort to get it back


469
0:23:35,57 --> 0:23:36,21
in.


470
0:23:36,21 --> 0:23:39,22
It was a Manhattan
Project-style effort.


471
0:23:39,22 --> 0:23:43,1
Again, the barriers to entry
are lowering, but it's not just,


472
0:23:43,1 --> 0:23:45,262
oh I need a teenager
and some Red Bull


473
0:23:45,262 --> 0:23:47,26
and I can carry this out.


474
0:23:47,26 --> 0:23:51,2
The second is history
is replete with examples


475
0:23:51,2 --> 0:23:53,86
that every time a military
assumed the offense was


476
0:23:53,86 --> 0:23:57,7
inherently dominant, that it
turned out to be the opposite.


477
0:23:57,7 --> 0:23:59,42
And we're on the
100 year anniversary


478
0:23:59,42 --> 0:24:1,21
of probably the best
illustration of that.


479
0:24:1,21 --> 0:24:4,6
Where the nations of Europe,
prior to World War I,


480
0:24:4,6 --> 0:24:7,6
all assumed that the new
technologies of the day


481
0:24:7,6 --> 0:24:9,55
meant that the offense
was advantaged.


482
0:24:9,55 --> 0:24:11,53
And in fact, it
was so advantaged


483
0:24:11,53 --> 0:24:15,5
that you couldn't allow yourself
to be stuck on the defensive.


484
0:24:15,5 --> 0:24:18,73
So you had to go to war
before the other guy could.


485
0:24:18,73 --> 0:24:21,23
So that you wouldn't be
caught at a disadvantage.


486
0:24:21,23 --> 0:24:23,65
And as we saw play
out in World War I,


487
0:24:23,65 --> 0:24:26,69
actually it was the defense
that turned out to be dominant.


488
0:24:26,69 --> 0:24:28,74
But the final
issue with this is,


489
0:24:28,74 --> 0:24:32,7
even if it's true
it doesn't actually


490
0:24:32,7 --> 0:24:37,11
mean that we should be
acting the way we are.


491
0:24:37,11 --> 0:24:43,16
To give a metaphor, the idea
of sitting in your glass house


492
0:24:43,16 --> 0:24:44,83
and looking around
and saying, gosh


493
0:24:44,83 --> 0:24:49,27
I'm worried about all these
roving gangs of teens.


494
0:24:49,27 --> 0:24:55,49
Well, my best answer is to
buy a stone sharpening kit.


495
0:24:55,49 --> 0:24:57,9
That's not the logic that
we should be following,


496
0:24:57,9 --> 0:24:59,28
but that's what we're
doing right now.


497
0:24:59,28 --> 0:25:1,89
So what can we do instead?


498
0:25:1,89 --> 0:25:4,76
The last third of the
book is all about these


499
0:25:4,76 --> 0:25:8,8
what can we do questions,
everything from global level


500
0:25:8,8 --> 0:25:11,8
responses to national level
down to corporate to you


501
0:25:11,8 --> 0:25:13,35
and I. How can we
protect ourselves


502
0:25:13,35 --> 0:25:15,54
and the broader internet itself.


503
0:25:15,54 --> 0:25:16,47
I'm not going to
try and summarize


504
0:25:16,47 --> 0:25:18,36
that 100 pages up here.


505
0:25:18,36 --> 0:25:22,29
So I'll just hit on five themes
that cut through all of it.


506
0:25:22,29 --> 0:25:26,26
The first theme is
knowledge matters.


507
0:25:26,26 --> 0:25:30,87
It is vital that we demystify
this realm if we ever


508
0:25:30,87 --> 0:25:34,49
want to get anything done
effective in securing it.


509
0:25:34,49 --> 0:25:37,385
We have to move past
the situation now


510
0:25:37,385 --> 0:25:41,22
where, for example, a White
House official described this


511
0:25:41,22 --> 0:25:45,19
as quote, "only
understood by the nerds."


512
0:25:45,19 --> 0:25:48,82
Or when the President
himself received a briefing


513
0:25:48,82 --> 0:25:51,11
on cyber security questions.


514
0:25:51,11 --> 0:25:53,96
And at the end of the briefing,
reportedly asked for, repeated


515
0:25:53,96 --> 0:25:57,48
back, quote, "This
time in English."


516
0:25:57,48 --> 0:26:0,23
That's not to beat up on the
residents of the White House.


517
0:26:0,23 --> 0:26:5,8
That would happen in almost
any major company that's


518
0:26:5,8 --> 0:26:9,71
not in this space, not in
Silicon Valley, but also


519
0:26:9,71 --> 0:26:12,412
even small companies,
a cupcake stand.


520
0:26:12,412 --> 0:26:13,87
It would happen at
the White House.


521
0:26:13,87 --> 0:26:16,38
It would happen at my house.


522
0:26:16,38 --> 0:26:18,46
The second theme
leads from this.


523
0:26:18,46 --> 0:26:20,17
It's that people matter.


524
0:26:20,17 --> 0:26:22,91
Cybersecurity is one of those
wicked problem areas that's


525
0:26:22,91 --> 0:26:25,6
rife with complexities
and trade-offs.


526
0:26:25,6 --> 0:26:28,22
And this is in large part not
because of the technical side,


527
0:26:28,22 --> 0:26:31,89
which often gets too much focus,
but rather the people part.


528
0:26:31,89 --> 0:26:34,275
Now it's useful from a
writer's perspective,


529
0:26:34,275 --> 0:26:36,65
because that gives you all
the fun characters and stories


530
0:26:36,65 --> 0:26:38,42
to populate.


531
0:26:38,42 --> 0:26:41,52
My favorite being the time
that Pakistan accidentally


532
0:26:41,52 --> 0:26:45,65
kidnapped all the world's
cute cat videos for a day.


533
0:26:45,65 --> 0:26:47,33
But it also means
that if you want


534
0:26:47,33 --> 0:26:51,32
to set up best responses at the
global level, business level,


535
0:26:51,32 --> 0:26:52,74
all the way down to
the individual level,


536
0:26:52,74 --> 0:26:55,91
you need to recognize that
the people behind the machines


537
0:26:55,91 --> 0:26:59,33
are both part of
every single problem.


538
0:26:59,33 --> 0:27:2,69
And have to be part of
every single solution.


539
0:27:2,69 --> 0:27:4,41
This leads to the next theme.


540
0:27:4,41 --> 0:27:6,0
Incentives matter.


541
0:27:6,0 --> 0:27:9,33
If you want to understand why
something is or isn't happening


542
0:27:9,33 --> 0:27:12,89
in cybersecurity, look
to the motivations,


543
0:27:12,89 --> 0:27:15,63
the relative costs,
the organizations


544
0:27:15,63 --> 0:27:18,62
that people are in, the
tensions at play between them.


545
0:27:18,62 --> 0:27:21,96
There is a reason why, for
example, finance companies


546
0:27:21,96 --> 0:27:23,9
are doing better at
their cyber security--


547
0:27:23,9 --> 0:27:26,69
both in terms of defending
themselves, but also sharing


548
0:27:26,69 --> 0:27:29,31
information --versus
how, for example,


549
0:27:29,31 --> 0:27:34,34
critical infrastructure and
natural gas or the power grid,


550
0:27:34,34 --> 0:27:37,92
how they're not cooperating and
not defending themselves well.


551
0:27:37,92 --> 0:27:40,49
It's because they're
incentivized both to directly


552
0:27:40,49 --> 0:27:42,88
understand the cost,
but also there's


553
0:27:42,88 --> 0:27:46,41
a regulatory environment around
them that's driving that.


554
0:27:46,41 --> 0:27:48,585
And this points to the
role that government


555
0:27:48,585 --> 0:27:50,87
can, and frankly
should, be playing.


556
0:27:50,87 --> 0:27:52,97
And everything from being
a trusted information


557
0:27:52,97 --> 0:27:56,86
provider to setting standards
to-- in other situations,


558
0:27:56,86 --> 0:27:59,86
it's going to have to create
market incentives, which


559
0:27:59,86 --> 0:28:2,45
is another way of
saying regulation.


560
0:28:2,45 --> 0:28:5,4
The fourth is history matters.


561
0:28:5,4 --> 0:28:9,9
There is a history to how we
got here with the internet.


562
0:28:9,9 --> 0:28:11,565
And too often it's ignored.


563
0:28:11,565 --> 0:28:13,69
And that's when you hear
these sort of silly things


564
0:28:13,69 --> 0:28:17,64
like oh, well let's just build
a new, more secure internet,


565
0:28:17,64 --> 0:28:20,29
which is not a workable concept.


566
0:28:20,29 --> 0:28:23,77
And yet it's gotten a lot of
credence in policy circles.


567
0:28:23,77 --> 0:28:25,73
But more broadly, it
means that there's


568
0:28:25,73 --> 0:28:29,552
a wealth of lessons to learn
from history and other fields.


569
0:28:29,552 --> 0:28:31,1
So if we're exploring,
for example,


570
0:28:31,1 --> 0:28:35,57
how to deal with cyber crime,
but also patriotic hacker


571
0:28:35,57 --> 0:28:38,2
communities that are
linked to states,


572
0:28:38,2 --> 0:28:41,8
we look at the age of
sail as a parallel.


573
0:28:41,8 --> 0:28:44,11
Where you have this
domain in which


574
0:28:44,11 --> 0:28:47,2
commerce, communication,
and conflict all


575
0:28:47,2 --> 0:28:49,11
played out on the open sea.


576
0:28:49,11 --> 0:28:52,83
The conflict actors ranged
from state militaries


577
0:28:52,83 --> 0:28:55,31
to individual criminal
groups, pirates,


578
0:28:55,31 --> 0:28:57,72
to these fuzzy things in
the middle, privateers,


579
0:28:57,72 --> 0:28:59,97
that sort of gave you some
of the advantage of pirates


580
0:28:59,97 --> 0:29:1,55
but also state-linked as well.


581
0:29:1,55 --> 0:29:3,5
And that's a lesson
that we can look


582
0:29:3,5 --> 0:29:5,66
to in how we went
after that trade.


583
0:29:5,66 --> 0:29:9,53
To if we want to understand
good role for government, let's


584
0:29:9,53 --> 0:29:13,21
look at the most successful
government agencies in history.


585
0:29:13,21 --> 0:29:15,87
Like the Centers for Disease
Control, which literally


586
0:29:15,87 --> 0:29:17,45
started with a
couple of scientists


587
0:29:17,45 --> 0:29:21,34
taking a $10 collection,
a tin cup for $10.


588
0:29:21,34 --> 0:29:24,92
And that agency went on to
eradicate malaria inside United


589
0:29:24,92 --> 0:29:27,81
States, to fight smallpox on
an international level, to oh,


590
0:29:27,81 --> 0:29:31,64
by the way, served as a critical
back channel to the Soviets


591
0:29:31,64 --> 0:29:34,18
in the worst part
of the Cold War.


592
0:29:34,18 --> 0:29:39,47
This leads to the final lesson,
and it comes from the saying


593
0:29:39,47 --> 0:29:43,13
that Ben Franklin had, that
"An ounce of prevention


594
0:29:43,13 --> 0:29:45,48
is worth a pound of cure."


595
0:29:45,48 --> 0:29:50,23
What's fascinating is that
the CDC did studies and proved


596
0:29:50,23 --> 0:29:55,14
that Franklin's saying actually
is true in public health.


597
0:29:55,14 --> 0:29:59,94
It's also true in
cybersecurity and cyberwar.


598
0:29:59,94 --> 0:30:3,84
Very simple steps
of cyber hygiene


599
0:30:3,84 --> 0:30:6,95
would have an immense impact.


600
0:30:6,95 --> 0:30:9,53
Indeed, one study of
the top 20 controls


601
0:30:9,53 --> 0:30:13,2
found that they would stop
94% of all cyber attacks.


602
0:30:13,2 --> 0:30:15,28
Now some people react to
that, and they go well,


603
0:30:15,28 --> 0:30:16,57
I'm really special.


604
0:30:16,57 --> 0:30:17,9
I'm in the 6%.


605
0:30:17,9 --> 0:30:21,16
Well, statistically we
all can't be in the 6%.


606
0:30:21,16 --> 0:30:23,63
But even more so
they should talk


607
0:30:23,63 --> 0:30:27,57
to their technical
folks, their IT crowd.


608
0:30:27,57 --> 0:30:30,5
And they would quickly
learn how if they didn't


609
0:30:30,5 --> 0:30:33,67
have to spend so much time
dealing with the low level


610
0:30:33,67 --> 0:30:37,16
stuff, they could actually
focus on the more advanced


611
0:30:37,16 --> 0:30:39,207
persistent threats
that are out there.


612
0:30:39,207 --> 0:30:41,4
And a large part of
this, what's interesting


613
0:30:41,4 --> 0:30:43,86
is the data shows that senior
executives are actually


614
0:30:43,86 --> 0:30:46,92
twice as likely to be
behind one of these problems


615
0:30:46,92 --> 0:30:50,64
as junior folks, which makes it
even more difficult for the IT


616
0:30:50,64 --> 0:30:52,72
department to deal with.


617
0:30:52,72 --> 0:30:56,73
To give some
illustrations of this--


618
0:30:56,73 --> 0:30:58,11
let me add one more thing on it.


619
0:30:58,11 --> 0:31:0,665
The other challenge to this is
that there's this assumption


620
0:31:0,665 --> 0:31:2,4
that the advanced
threats are all


621
0:31:2,4 --> 0:31:4,91
using very advanced pathways in.


622
0:31:4,91 --> 0:31:7,2
And yet consistently,
they're coming


623
0:31:7,2 --> 0:31:11,0
in through rather
simple approaches.


624
0:31:11,0 --> 0:31:14,56
For example, the most
important outside penetration


625
0:31:14,56 --> 0:31:19,61
of US military classified
networks by a foreign espionage


626
0:31:19,61 --> 0:31:22,29
agency happened
when they conducted


627
0:31:22,29 --> 0:31:24,2
what's known as a candy drop.


628
0:31:24,2 --> 0:31:27,82
Basically they
dropped memory sticks


629
0:31:27,82 --> 0:31:31,42
in a parking lot outside
a US military base.


630
0:31:31,42 --> 0:31:33,99
And while we learn in
preschool don't take candy


631
0:31:33,99 --> 0:31:38,31
from strangers, a US soldier
saw the shiny memory stick


632
0:31:38,31 --> 0:31:39,24
in the dirt.


633
0:31:39,24 --> 0:31:41,0
Thought this was
really cool, picked


634
0:31:41,0 --> 0:31:42,677
it up, wanted to
see what was on it.


635
0:31:42,677 --> 0:31:44,51
So he took it inside
the base and plugged it


636
0:31:44,51 --> 0:31:45,75
into his computer.


637
0:31:45,75 --> 0:31:48,395
And that was actually the
most important penetration


638
0:31:48,395 --> 0:31:51,2
of US military networks
from the outside.


639
0:31:51,2 --> 0:31:57,51
To the insider threat, the
episodes of Manning or Snowden.


640
0:31:57,51 --> 0:32:1,84
Again, wherever you
come down on them,


641
0:32:1,84 --> 0:32:5,85
we can all agree that the
organizations were not


642
0:32:5,85 --> 0:32:9,68
following the kind of
internal security norms


643
0:32:9,68 --> 0:32:11,81
that a cupcake
store should have.


644
0:32:11,81 --> 0:32:15,1
Monitoring, for example,
massively anomalous traffic,


645
0:32:15,1 --> 0:32:17,2
things like that.


646
0:32:17,2 --> 0:32:22,78
Now this idea of hygiene
is important-- again,


647
0:32:22,78 --> 0:32:24,666
when I say hygiene,
picking up a memory stick


648
0:32:24,666 --> 0:32:25,79
that you found in the dirt.


649
0:32:25,79 --> 0:32:28,1
That's basic hygiene,
that's the five second rule,


650
0:32:28,1 --> 0:32:29,5
let alone cyber hygiene.


651
0:32:29,5 --> 0:32:34,41
But this idea of hygiene, I
think, is important not just


652
0:32:34,41 --> 0:32:38,92
because of that idea of
prevention, but even more so


653
0:32:38,92 --> 0:32:41,2
the ethic behind it.


654
0:32:41,2 --> 0:32:43,8
That we need--
again, whether we're


655
0:32:43,8 --> 0:32:45,455
talking about this on a global
level, a national level,


656
0:32:45,455 --> 0:32:48,42
a business level, to
an individual level.


657
0:32:48,42 --> 0:32:51,44
I teach my kids hygiene.


658
0:32:51,44 --> 0:32:54,11
Wash your hands, cover
your mouth when you cough.


659
0:32:54,11 --> 0:32:56,6
I teach them that not only
to protect themselves,


660
0:32:56,6 --> 0:32:59,65
but also that they
have a responsibility


661
0:32:59,65 --> 0:33:2,14
to protect all that they
connect with through the course


662
0:33:2,14 --> 0:33:3,26
of their day.


663
0:33:3,26 --> 0:33:4,98
That's the same kind
of ethic that we


664
0:33:4,98 --> 0:33:6,199
need in the online space.


665
0:33:6,199 --> 0:33:7,74
And we should be
pushing more of that


666
0:33:7,74 --> 0:33:11,4
rather than the fears that
are out there driving us.


667
0:33:11,4 --> 0:33:15,12
So to bring this
story full circle,


668
0:33:15,12 --> 0:33:19,47
in the beginning I talked about
how when I was seven years old


669
0:33:19,47 --> 0:33:21,65
I saw my first computer.


670
0:33:21,65 --> 0:33:25,63
Now if you had told
little seven-year-old me


671
0:33:25,63 --> 0:33:29,56
that one day this Commodore
or its descendants


672
0:33:29,56 --> 0:33:34,87
would allow someone
to steal your money,


673
0:33:34,87 --> 0:33:41,39
steal your identity, even become
a weapon of mass disruption,


674
0:33:41,39 --> 0:33:44,3
I would've begged and
pleaded with my dad


675
0:33:44,3 --> 0:33:47,28
not to turn on the power button.


676
0:33:47,28 --> 0:33:51,8
Don't let us go into this
dangerous, scary world.


677
0:33:51,8 --> 0:33:55,3
Today I wouldn't have
it any other way.


678
0:33:55,3 --> 0:33:59,36
Because that technology
has given me and all of us


679
0:33:59,36 --> 0:34:4,2
literally superpowers that
we didn't imagine back then.


680
0:34:4,2 --> 0:34:11,199
We can ask any question and
Google the answer to it.


681
0:34:11,199 --> 0:34:15,179
Any question, important
or not important.


682
0:34:15,179 --> 0:34:18,3
Yesterday I was looking
up the backstory


683
0:34:18,3 --> 0:34:22,102
of a minor noble in
the "Game of Thrones."


684
0:34:22,102 --> 0:34:23,685
That's actually the
important example.


685
0:34:23,685 --> 0:34:26,53



686
0:34:26,53 --> 0:34:28,489
This technology has
given us the power


687
0:34:28,489 --> 0:34:36,4
to become friends with people
that we've literally never met.


688
0:34:36,4 --> 0:34:38,94
All of these great
steps forward.


689
0:34:38,94 --> 0:34:42,92
And so the same as it
was back then, I think,


690
0:34:42,92 --> 0:34:45,65
is the way it will
be in the future.


691
0:34:45,65 --> 0:34:50,1
We have to accept and manage
the risks of this world--


692
0:34:50,1 --> 0:34:54,8
whether it's the online world
or the real world, so to speak,


693
0:34:54,8 --> 0:34:57,73
--because of all that
can be achieved in it.


694
0:34:57,73 --> 0:35:0,95
And to steal the
title from the book,


695
0:35:0,95 --> 0:35:4,4
in the end, that's really
what everyone needs to know.


696
0:35:4,4 --> 0:35:4,85
Thank you.


697
0:35:4,85 --> 0:35:6,81
[APPLAUSE]


698
0:35:6,81 --> 0:35:12,69



699
0:35:12,69 --> 0:35:14,62
MALE SPEAKER: We'll
do a short Q&A. Please


700
0:35:14,62 --> 0:35:17,2
wait for the audience
mic to arrive to you.


701
0:35:17,2 --> 0:35:20,94
And I wanted to mention one more
thing that Peter told me about.


702
0:35:20,94 --> 0:35:22,97
And this is, there's a website.


703
0:35:22,97 --> 0:35:26,38
It's called
cybersecuritybook.com.


704
0:35:26,38 --> 0:35:31,52
And there's a cybersecurity
song playlist there.


705
0:35:31,52 --> 0:35:34,63
I'm curious myself
now what that is.


706
0:35:34,63 --> 0:35:35,51
Questions?


707
0:35:35,51 --> 0:35:37,51
AUDIENCE: It seemed like
one of the big problems


708
0:35:37,51 --> 0:35:39,99
you mentioned was a
problem of leadership.


709
0:35:39,99 --> 0:35:42,6
And the people who
are empowered just


710
0:35:42,6 --> 0:35:44,829
don't have the sophistication
to talk about these issues


711
0:35:44,829 --> 0:35:45,62
and make decisions.


712
0:35:45,62 --> 0:35:47,66
And I just was
wondering what you


713
0:35:47,66 --> 0:35:50,919
thought was the minimum
level of competence


714
0:35:50,919 --> 0:35:51,96
required by these people?


715
0:35:51,96 --> 0:35:54,481
Because realistically, they
seem to be pretty entrenched.


716
0:35:54,481 --> 0:35:56,23
And I don't think it's
realistic to expect


717
0:35:56,23 --> 0:35:57,65
a whole new breed of
people to come in and make


718
0:35:57,65 --> 0:35:58,58
these decisions.


719
0:35:58,58 --> 0:36:1,31
And on that point, as
well, how likely do


720
0:36:1,31 --> 0:36:3,675
think it is to be able to get
these people to that level


721
0:36:3,675 --> 0:36:6,5
of sophistication, given the
fact that these people don't


722
0:36:6,5 --> 0:36:8,42
know how to use email?


723
0:36:8,42 --> 0:36:11,57
PETER SINGER: It's
a great question.


724
0:36:11,57 --> 0:36:15,26
And one part of it,
sometimes people say well,


725
0:36:15,26 --> 0:36:17,88
isn't this just
a digital native,


726
0:36:17,88 --> 0:36:20,49
digital immigrant issue?


727
0:36:20,49 --> 0:36:25,38
That digital immigrants,
someone who grew up in a world


728
0:36:25,38 --> 0:36:26,84
without computers
and then now has


729
0:36:26,84 --> 0:36:30,84
moved into this world versus
a native who was born into it


730
0:36:30,84 --> 0:36:33,57
and it all seems
natural and intuitive.


731
0:36:33,57 --> 0:36:37,59
And so this problem, won't
it just solve itself,


732
0:36:37,59 --> 0:36:40,88
is how they sometimes
reference it.


733
0:36:40,88 --> 0:36:46,39
First, there's a long period
of time before the immigrants,


734
0:36:46,39 --> 0:36:50,35
so to speak, move out of
the positions of power.


735
0:36:50,35 --> 0:36:54,187
To put it a different
way-- there's


736
0:36:54,187 --> 0:36:55,645
a quote in the book
from a guy that


737
0:36:55,645 --> 0:36:58,72
talks about how the folks that
are sitting in the big boy


738
0:36:58,72 --> 0:37:0,32
chairs, is how he phrased it.


739
0:37:0,32 --> 0:37:3,64
The big boy chairs in
government or at CEOs


740
0:37:3,64 --> 0:37:7,26
of a lot of different companies
or the like, many of them


741
0:37:7,26 --> 0:37:9,95
didn't see or use
their first computer


742
0:37:9,95 --> 0:37:13,36
until they were in
their 30s or 40s.


743
0:37:13,36 --> 0:37:16,83
But it doesn't mean
one, they're going


744
0:37:16,83 --> 0:37:18,6
to be in those positions
for a long time.


745
0:37:18,6 --> 0:37:21,15
And so we've got this
gap, this period of time.


746
0:37:21,15 --> 0:37:22,4
We can't wait it out.


747
0:37:22,4 --> 0:37:26,5
The second is a lot
of digital natives


748
0:37:26,5 --> 0:37:28,95
don't have this intuitively
the way it's assumed.


749
0:37:28,95 --> 0:37:33,23
In large part because of how
we've stovepiped these issues.


750
0:37:33,23 --> 0:37:36,2
That's for the IT
folks to handle.


751
0:37:36,2 --> 0:37:38,96
Or the IT folks saying, oh,
well that's for legal to handle,


752
0:37:38,96 --> 0:37:41,27
that's not for us.


753
0:37:41,27 --> 0:37:46,9
And so to your question,
what's the level of expertise.


754
0:37:46,9 --> 0:37:49,91
I don't think there's a common
test that everyone has to pass,


755
0:37:49,91 --> 0:37:50,957
or something like that.


756
0:37:50,957 --> 0:37:53,29
I actually-- and this may be
a little bit controversial.


757
0:37:53,29 --> 0:37:54,74
I don't think it's
even about people


758
0:37:54,74 --> 0:37:57,156
knowing how to do things like
computer programming-- maybe


759
0:37:57,156 --> 0:37:59,38
it's controversial in this room.


760
0:37:59,38 --> 0:38:7,19
It's instead having familiarity
of the key concepts,


761
0:38:7,19 --> 0:38:11,23
the key terms, so
that frankly, they


762
0:38:11,23 --> 0:38:15,14
can have a good
argument about it.


763
0:38:15,14 --> 0:38:20,83
You can see this in what's
playing out with the NSA issues


764
0:38:20,83 --> 0:38:24,64
recently, where
both the mass media,


765
0:38:24,64 --> 0:38:28,82
but also both sides in
Congress that are arguing it,


766
0:38:28,82 --> 0:38:32,56
it's just so factually
disconnected.


767
0:38:32,56 --> 0:38:35,74
And so they're not able to even
have a good argument about it.


768
0:38:35,74 --> 0:38:38,56
To use that illustration
of offense, defense theory.


769
0:38:38,56 --> 0:38:40,83
It's a great way
of showing this.


770
0:38:40,83 --> 0:38:42,72
Where on one hand
the people that


771
0:38:42,72 --> 0:38:45,1
understand the
technical side don't


772
0:38:45,1 --> 0:38:47,65
know that there's actually
a very rich literature


773
0:38:47,65 --> 0:38:50,642
in international relations
of offense, defense,


774
0:38:50,642 --> 0:38:52,85
that doesn't lead you to
one conclusion or the other.


775
0:38:52,85 --> 0:38:55,2
And they were sort of-- they
picked one part of it and said,


776
0:38:55,2 --> 0:38:56,936
this is the conclusion
of what we should take.


777
0:38:56,936 --> 0:39:1,27
In turn the IR crowd doesn't
understand this all that well.


778
0:39:1,27 --> 0:39:5,67
The bigger thing is not a level
of knowledge, it's an attitude.


779
0:39:5,67 --> 0:39:10,37
There's too much Ludditism
out there that's celebrated.


780
0:39:10,37 --> 0:39:13,47
A senior government official
who held responsibility


781
0:39:13,47 --> 0:39:16,17
for this literally
saying, doesn't


782
0:39:16,17 --> 0:39:18,51
think it's all that useful.


783
0:39:18,51 --> 0:39:20,66
And she did the same
thing the SecDef did,


784
0:39:20,66 --> 0:39:22,99
where if their
email came in it's


785
0:39:22,99 --> 0:39:24,59
printed out by the assistant.


786
0:39:24,59 --> 0:39:25,84
They write their answer on it.


787
0:39:25,84 --> 0:39:27,55
And then they hand it back.


788
0:39:27,55 --> 0:39:30,349
You can't be effective if
that's the kind of attitude


789
0:39:30,349 --> 0:39:31,89
that you have, both
for your internal


790
0:39:31,89 --> 0:39:36,17
but you think it's OK to talk
to others about it that way.


791
0:39:36,17 --> 0:39:39,112
And so for me it's,
again, there's


792
0:39:39,112 --> 0:39:40,32
some base level of knowledge.


793
0:39:40,32 --> 0:39:42,82
But it's more about changing
the attitudes around it.


794
0:39:42,82 --> 0:39:47,5
And frankly stop looking at
this as just a highly technical


795
0:39:47,5 --> 0:39:52,47
issue for, again, the IT
crowd, or for the nerds.


796
0:39:52,47 --> 0:39:54,27
AUDIENCE: What
principles have we


797
0:39:54,27 --> 0:39:59,59
learned from the behavior of
immune systems and biology,


798
0:39:59,59 --> 0:40:2,315
and from the resilience
of biological networks


799
0:40:2,315 --> 0:40:3,94
all the way from the
metabolic networks


800
0:40:3,94 --> 0:40:8,11
up to ecologies, what principles
have we learned that we are not


801
0:40:8,11 --> 0:40:11,14
yet applying in cybersecurity?


802
0:40:11,14 --> 0:40:12,93
PETER SINGER: That's
actually a great question


803
0:40:12,93 --> 0:40:14,471
to bridge back to
the prior question.


804
0:40:14,471 --> 0:40:18,85
Because that all-important
word that you used,


805
0:40:18,85 --> 0:40:21,7
resilience, is
what I think should


806
0:40:21,7 --> 0:40:24,605
be at the centerpiece
of our approaches


807
0:40:24,605 --> 0:40:25,98
and our discussions
and the like.


808
0:40:25,98 --> 0:40:29,94



809
0:40:29,94 --> 0:40:33,43
And you see this, again,
on the government side.


810
0:40:33,43 --> 0:40:37,13
But also on the business side.


811
0:40:37,13 --> 0:40:41,5
Basically there's this
mentality of offense, defense.


812
0:40:41,5 --> 0:40:46,6
And defense, it's build
higher or thicker walls.


813
0:40:46,6 --> 0:40:48,66



814
0:40:48,66 --> 0:40:52,38
And then the offense
side is, weirdly enough,


815
0:40:52,38 --> 0:40:54,65
coming back into
the private sector


816
0:40:54,65 --> 0:40:57,35
with the emergence of the
potential hack back industry,


817
0:40:57,35 --> 0:41:0,11
of oh, the best way to
protect yourself is not just


818
0:41:0,11 --> 0:41:5,91
to build a high wall but we'll
go after the bad guys for you.


819
0:41:5,91 --> 0:41:9,0
It's basically a business
version of vigilantism.


820
0:41:9,0 --> 0:41:13,814
It has major concerns for
international relations,


821
0:41:13,814 --> 0:41:15,48
because it could
quickly escalate things


822
0:41:15,48 --> 0:41:17,1
in a way that's unplanned.


823
0:41:17,1 --> 0:41:21,9
It's also a horrible business
model for the client.


824
0:41:21,9 --> 0:41:26,5
Vigilantism only worked
for Charles Bronson.


825
0:41:26,5 --> 0:41:30,26
This idea of the best way
to defend yourself-- I'm


826
0:41:30,26 --> 0:41:31,48
going to go after this guy.


827
0:41:31,48 --> 0:41:32,24
And then oh, you're attacking?


828
0:41:32,24 --> 0:41:33,62
I'll go after this guy,
this guy, this guy.


829
0:41:33,62 --> 0:41:35,13
And so at the end of
the day all you're


830
0:41:35,13 --> 0:41:37,33
doing is paying someone to
go after others for you,


831
0:41:37,33 --> 0:41:39,39
not actually making
yourself secure.


832
0:41:39,39 --> 0:41:41,25
Instead of this
mentality, it goes


833
0:41:41,25 --> 0:41:43,29
to what you asked
about, resilience.


834
0:41:43,29 --> 0:41:47,94
And you can think about this
in the physiological way.


835
0:41:47,94 --> 0:41:51,1
And that turns on everything
from the notion of it being


836
0:41:51,1 --> 0:41:54,99
not a Cold War-- you
know, this idea of we're


837
0:41:54,99 --> 0:41:57,535
in a new Cold War is
literally a quote from folks.


838
0:41:57,535 --> 0:42:0,11



839
0:42:0,11 --> 0:42:5,0
One, malware is not like the
physics of a nuclear weapon.


840
0:42:5,0 --> 0:42:9,93
Second, there's not the bipolar
relationship of two powers.


841
0:42:9,93 --> 0:42:12,6
The players in
cybersecurity are just


842
0:42:12,6 --> 0:42:14,13
like the players in cyberspace.


843
0:42:14,13 --> 0:42:17,77
It's everything from the
100 cyber military units


844
0:42:17,77 --> 0:42:21,29
out there to
non-state collectives


845
0:42:21,29 --> 0:42:25,33
interested in everything from
cute cats to online protest


846
0:42:25,33 --> 0:42:28,47
to corporations that range
from Google to Target


847
0:42:28,47 --> 0:42:29,98
to the cupcake store.


848
0:42:29,98 --> 0:42:33,85
And so it doesn't fit that
to the online battle of ideas


849
0:42:33,85 --> 0:42:37,33
is not the ideological Cold
War battle that it's framed.


850
0:42:37,33 --> 0:42:41,19
The online battle of
ideas are-- go on YouTube


851
0:42:41,19 --> 0:42:43,5
and you can see the
diversity of them.


852
0:42:43,5 --> 0:42:46,6
And so instead it's this
ecosystem of players.


853
0:42:46,6 --> 0:42:49,17
And then it goes to the idea
of the physiological approach


854
0:42:49,17 --> 0:42:50,11
of your own body.


855
0:42:50,11 --> 0:42:53,505
Our bodies are probably the most
resilient thing ever created.


856
0:42:53,505 --> 0:42:57,21



857
0:42:57,21 --> 0:43:1,58
They're designed for a world
that's incredibly hostile.


858
0:43:1,58 --> 0:43:3,58
They expect that bad
things are going to happen.


859
0:43:3,58 --> 0:43:5,75
They have a really
great exterior line


860
0:43:5,75 --> 0:43:7,66
of defense, your skin.


861
0:43:7,66 --> 0:43:11,54
But they fully plan that
that skin, at some point,


862
0:43:11,54 --> 0:43:13,91
will definitely be penetrated.


863
0:43:13,91 --> 0:43:17,1
And it has all sorts of
systems to react to that.


864
0:43:17,1 --> 0:43:21,7
Everything from stemming the
flow to monitoring infection,


865
0:43:21,7 --> 0:43:24,4
internal monitoring systems,
to your body triages


866
0:43:24,4 --> 0:43:26,16
between what's
important what's not


867
0:43:26,16 --> 0:43:28,81
to-- guess what,
your body itself


868
0:43:28,81 --> 0:43:31,83
operates on the assumption that
something external is already


869
0:43:31,83 --> 0:43:32,79
inside.


870
0:43:32,79 --> 0:43:35,33
There's 10 times
as much-- when you


871
0:43:35,33 --> 0:43:37,49
look at the number
of cell counts,


872
0:43:37,49 --> 0:43:38,97
there's 10 times
as much bacteria


873
0:43:38,97 --> 0:43:41,72
and the like in your body
than there are human cells.


874
0:43:41,72 --> 0:43:46,12
And again compare that to the
typical oh, just buy my widget,


875
0:43:46,12 --> 0:43:49,42
or if I have a better, stronger
password I'll keep them out.


876
0:43:49,42 --> 0:43:51,84
But there's another
idea of resilience


877
0:43:51,84 --> 0:43:54,81
that I don't think we
pay enough attention to.


878
0:43:54,81 --> 0:43:58,42
And that's psychological
resilience.


879
0:43:58,42 --> 0:44:3,6
There's 3,000 books on
psychological resilience


880
0:44:3,6 --> 0:44:4,61
of some sort.


881
0:44:4,61 --> 0:44:9,65
Resilience in your job,
resilience in your love life,


882
0:44:9,65 --> 0:44:10,464
et cetera.


883
0:44:10,464 --> 0:44:11,88
And it's all built
around the idea


884
0:44:11,88 --> 0:44:14,56
that you can't go
through life thinking


885
0:44:14,56 --> 0:44:16,74
that bad things
will never happen,


886
0:44:16,74 --> 0:44:19,28
or they can all be
deterred or defeated.


887
0:44:19,28 --> 0:44:23,73
Instead, your success is
dependent on your assumption


888
0:44:23,73 --> 0:44:25,26
that bad things will play out.


889
0:44:25,26 --> 0:44:27,45
But it's all about how will
you power through them?


890
0:44:27,45 --> 0:44:29,93
How will you recover
quickly from them?


891
0:44:29,93 --> 0:44:32,92
How will you not allow them
to knock you down in the way


892
0:44:32,92 --> 0:44:33,587
that they could?


893
0:44:33,587 --> 0:44:35,253
All these different
way-- and again, you


894
0:44:35,253 --> 0:44:37,84
can think about in your love
life to your job, whatever.


895
0:44:37,84 --> 0:44:42,54
We need that same mentality
when it comes to cyber.


896
0:44:42,54 --> 0:44:48,45
So take cyberterrorism,
the central discussion


897
0:44:48,45 --> 0:44:52,18
of, oh my god, the power
grid might go down.


898
0:44:52,18 --> 0:44:54,92
And in fact, you've seen all
of these false news reports


899
0:44:54,92 --> 0:44:57,23
about times that cyber
attacks caused it.


900
0:44:57,23 --> 0:45:2,15
Which either in one situation
the power didn't go out,


901
0:45:2,15 --> 0:45:4,26
it's a false story
that-- guess what,


902
0:45:4,26 --> 0:45:7,58
"60 Minutes"
unsurprisingly covered.


903
0:45:7,58 --> 0:45:10,74
To another situation, things
that are described as cyber


904
0:45:10,74 --> 0:45:11,89
attacks that they're not.


905
0:45:11,89 --> 0:45:15,63
So two dudes with a rifle,
that's not a cyber attack.


906
0:45:15,63 --> 0:45:18,54
But that was recently in
the news covered as in this.


907
0:45:18,54 --> 0:45:21,7
The bottom line is that
squirrels have taken down


908
0:45:21,7 --> 0:45:26,33
more power grids than the
zero times that hackers have.


909
0:45:26,33 --> 0:45:27,74
Again, it could play out.


910
0:45:27,74 --> 0:45:29,89
But it's all about how
will we react to it.


911
0:45:29,89 --> 0:45:32,43



912
0:45:32,43 --> 0:45:35,74
Where I live outside
Washington, the power


913
0:45:35,74 --> 0:45:37,87
went down multiple
times this summer.


914
0:45:37,87 --> 0:45:41,4



915
0:45:41,4 --> 0:45:45,12
But if it had been a cyber
attack that caused it,


916
0:45:45,12 --> 0:45:47,74
we would have had a
congressional commission


917
0:45:47,74 --> 0:45:49,62
investigating who to blame.


918
0:45:49,62 --> 0:45:53,23
And we would have had
mass hysteria around it.


919
0:45:53,23 --> 0:45:56,86
And so what I would prefer-- and
I go back to that echo of 9/11


920
0:45:56,86 --> 0:46:1,66
and how you react --is the
British mentality to terrorism,


921
0:46:1,66 --> 0:46:3,37
keep calm and carry on.


922
0:46:3,37 --> 0:46:7,37
Rather than the
American model, which is


923
0:46:7,37 --> 0:46:12,65
we try and out-escalate the
hype and the fear around it.


924
0:46:12,65 --> 0:46:17,4
Because we're seeing more
gains in the fear and hype.


925
0:46:17,4 --> 0:46:20,27
And my worry is that's
carrying over to cyber side.


926
0:46:20,27 --> 0:46:23,77
AUDIENCE: The cyber crime that
really matters in the Snowden


927
0:46:23,77 --> 0:46:29,6
story is not what Snowden
did, but what he revealed.


928
0:46:29,6 --> 0:46:34,47
Alexander has two mandates,
both offense and defense.


929
0:46:34,47 --> 0:46:37,85
And as we've seen
and as you've said,


930
0:46:37,85 --> 0:46:42,5
the offense has dominated
in his activities.


931
0:46:42,5 --> 0:46:47,73
But whether offense
inevitably dominates,


932
0:46:47,73 --> 0:46:52,54
as they seem to think and as is
premised behind their actions,


933
0:46:52,54 --> 0:46:54,64
they've loaded the dice.


934
0:46:54,64 --> 0:46:56,96
Part of what they've
done is rather than


935
0:46:56,96 --> 0:47:0,66
also act on their
defensive mandate,


936
0:47:0,66 --> 0:47:5,69
they have purposely gone out
and inserted vulnerabilities,


937
0:47:5,69 --> 0:47:9,46
worked with vendors
of security software


938
0:47:9,46 --> 0:47:11,46
to purposely insert
vulnerabilities,


939
0:47:11,46 --> 0:47:14,33
making us more vulnerable.


940
0:47:14,33 --> 0:47:17,67
And as you said,
incentives matter.


941
0:47:17,67 --> 0:47:20,17
Let's take a look-- in
the absence of Snowden,


942
0:47:20,17 --> 0:47:22,91
let's take a look
at the incentives


943
0:47:22,91 --> 0:47:26,49
on secret intelligence
agencies themselves.


944
0:47:26,49 --> 0:47:30,3
What is the bureaucratic reward
for successfully carrying out


945
0:47:30,3 --> 0:47:31,58
an attack?


946
0:47:31,58 --> 0:47:34,77
And what is the
bureaucratic reward


947
0:47:34,77 --> 0:47:38,91
for successfully preventing
attacks that aren't visible


948
0:47:38,91 --> 0:47:41,1
because they couldn't happen?


949
0:47:41,1 --> 0:47:43,16
The second is invisible.


950
0:47:43,16 --> 0:47:45,81
The bureaucratic
reward structure


951
0:47:45,81 --> 0:47:48,18
has no means to reward it.


952
0:47:48,18 --> 0:47:52,45
And in the absence of Snowden,
the first is cost-free.


953
0:47:52,45 --> 0:47:55,93
PETER SINGER: I'm in agreement
with you on a couple of areas.


954
0:47:55,93 --> 0:47:58,9
One, on the notion
of incentives.


955
0:47:58,9 --> 0:48:0,51
And again, you can see
that whether you're


956
0:48:0,51 --> 0:48:4,22
talking about within that
intelligence agency to why


957
0:48:4,22 --> 0:48:7,38
we see on the defense side
certain industries cooperate


958
0:48:7,38 --> 0:48:7,909
or not.


959
0:48:7,909 --> 0:48:8,95
And it all turns on that.


960
0:48:8,95 --> 0:48:10,73
But then there's the
broader-- essentially


961
0:48:10,73 --> 0:48:14,3
you pulled the
bandage of Snowden.


962
0:48:14,3 --> 0:48:15,59
And so we've got to go at it.


963
0:48:15,59 --> 0:48:20,8
And you began by hitting
one part of his activity.


964
0:48:20,8 --> 0:48:22,93
And I think this is
the challenge right now


965
0:48:22,93 --> 0:48:27,65
in the discussion and
debate around him,


966
0:48:27,65 --> 0:48:30,85
the NSA, is he a traitor, is
he a whistleblower, should he


967
0:48:30,85 --> 0:48:36,96
get clemency or the like,
is that essentially he


968
0:48:36,96 --> 0:48:42,47
gathered and now is being
released-- actually not by him.


969
0:48:42,47 --> 0:48:44,5
This is one of the
myths that's out there.


970
0:48:44,5 --> 0:48:47,9
It's not him pulling
the strings right now.


971
0:48:47,9 --> 0:48:50,821
The journalists, they're
actually going through it.


972
0:48:50,821 --> 0:48:53,7
And the challenge for them
is because there's so much,


973
0:48:53,7 --> 0:48:55,75
it actually involves,
again, a very different set


974
0:48:55,75 --> 0:48:56,88
of expertise.


975
0:48:56,88 --> 0:49:1,51
So someone who understands
the technology will not


976
0:49:1,51 --> 0:49:5,76
get-- they'll see a name pop
up that, say, the Latin America


977
0:49:5,76 --> 0:49:8,21
beat reporter will go whoa,
whoa, whoa, that name.


978
0:49:8,21 --> 0:49:11,35
That guy's now the Deputy
Foreign Minister of Brazil.


979
0:49:11,35 --> 0:49:12,98
That name is meaningless
to the person


980
0:49:12,98 --> 0:49:16,25
who knows what this acronym
means that the Latin America


981
0:49:16,25 --> 0:49:17,632
reporter doesn't know that.


982
0:49:17,632 --> 0:49:19,59
And then in turn you need
the spy and the like.


983
0:49:19,59 --> 0:49:22,91
So they're actually having
these teams go through it


984
0:49:22,91 --> 0:49:27,34
and figuring out what's
newsworthy or not.


985
0:49:27,34 --> 0:49:30,39
But the bottom line is there's
such a mass of information


986
0:49:30,39 --> 0:49:32,84
and the wide variety of
stories that have come out


987
0:49:32,84 --> 0:49:37,74
and will continue to come
out is that it essentially


988
0:49:37,74 --> 0:49:42,17
falls into three very
different buckets of activity


989
0:49:42,17 --> 0:49:44,13
that has been disclosed.


990
0:49:44,13 --> 0:49:47,22
The first bucket of
activity is frankly


991
0:49:47,22 --> 0:49:52,33
what I would describe as
smart strategic espionage


992
0:49:52,33 --> 0:49:55,3
against American enemies.


993
0:49:55,3 --> 0:49:57,72
And you hit sort
of the mentality


994
0:49:57,72 --> 0:49:59,27
that drive some of that.


995
0:49:59,27 --> 0:50:1,226
Now there's an issue
of-- you said they


996
0:50:1,226 --> 0:50:3,35
when you're talking about
NSA versus cyber command.


997
0:50:3,35 --> 0:50:5,391
And they're the top military
intelligence agency.


998
0:50:5,391 --> 0:50:8,25
But the bottom line is
one bucket of activity


999
0:50:8,25 --> 0:50:15,16
was things that we would expect
and want an agency to do.


1000
0:50:15,16 --> 0:50:20,3
Going after monitoring
terror rings in Pakistan,


1001
0:50:20,3 --> 0:50:24,27
Iranian nuclear research,
China, et cetera.


1002
0:50:24,27 --> 0:50:28,99
Bucket number two is what
I would term questionable.


1003
0:50:28,99 --> 0:50:31,32
Activities that there
is a debate around


1004
0:50:31,32 --> 0:50:35,43
because it involves US citizens
in some way, shape, or form.


1005
0:50:35,43 --> 0:50:40,7
Either through legal approaches
on the front door to back door


1006
0:50:40,7 --> 0:50:43,86
to running with an
authorization in a way


1007
0:50:43,86 --> 0:50:47,3
that the policymaker that
authorized it didn't understand


1008
0:50:47,3 --> 0:50:51,15
what was authorized
to essentially deals


1009
0:50:51,15 --> 0:50:53,4
made with foreign
intelligence agencies


1010
0:50:53,4 --> 0:50:55,4
where they were able to
collect things in a way


1011
0:50:55,4 --> 0:50:57,92
that we couldn't, an exchange
of information and the like.


1012
0:50:57,92 --> 0:51:1,87
But basically the debate around
involvement of US citizens.


1013
0:51:1,87 --> 0:51:5,56
Category three is
the bucket that I


1014
0:51:5,56 --> 0:51:9,59
would describe as unstrategic,
or more directly stupid.


1015
0:51:9,59 --> 0:51:13,76
And that is targeting
of close American allies


1016
0:51:13,76 --> 0:51:16,53
and American
technology companies.


1017
0:51:16,53 --> 0:51:20,17
And the resonance of
that is everything


1018
0:51:20,17 --> 0:51:22,39
from how I mentioned
the hammering


1019
0:51:22,39 --> 0:51:25,51
to other kinds of
international negotiations that


1020
0:51:25,51 --> 0:51:28,49
may matter more to
as you mentioned,


1021
0:51:28,49 --> 0:51:33,49
the undermining of
cybersecurity for all of us.


1022
0:51:33,49 --> 0:51:34,59
Particularly based
on this assumption


1023
0:51:34,59 --> 0:51:36,298
that they were the
only ones smart enough


1024
0:51:36,298 --> 0:51:40,18
to find the vulnerability,
but then more broadly what


1025
0:51:40,18 --> 0:51:43,5
it's done to that
critical word, trust,


1026
0:51:43,5 --> 0:51:45,182
trust in American
technology companies.


1027
0:51:45,182 --> 0:51:46,64
And the resonance
of that, at least


1028
0:51:46,64 --> 0:51:48,45
according to
Forrester Research, is


1029
0:51:48,45 --> 0:51:51,52
that your industry will lose
approximately $180 billion


1030
0:51:51,52 --> 0:51:52,75
worth of revenue.


1031
0:51:52,75 --> 0:51:54,49
That's why people
here are pissed.


1032
0:51:54,49 --> 0:51:59,31
The problem, though, is
that in the debate around it


1033
0:51:59,31 --> 0:52:3,28
we pull from whichever
bucket we care most about.


1034
0:52:3,28 --> 0:52:6,47
So if you care most about
classic national security,


1035
0:52:6,47 --> 0:52:9,21
you go, this guy disclosed
things that are important.


1036
0:52:9,21 --> 0:52:11,99
He is a traitor,
dada, dada, dada.


1037
0:52:11,99 --> 0:52:15,52
If you care about the privacy
Fourth Amendment questions,


1038
0:52:15,52 --> 0:52:18,38
you only talk about
those, and he's


1039
0:52:18,38 --> 0:52:20,77
a whistleblower, and
clemency, and the like.


1040
0:52:20,77 --> 0:52:23,19
We see it also in
how we defend it


1041
0:52:23,19 --> 0:52:25,68
from the narrative on
the government side.


1042
0:52:25,68 --> 0:52:31,67
So these kind of activities
are to prevent another 9/11.


1043
0:52:31,67 --> 0:52:36,69
Which may describe bucket two
and the metadata and the like,


1044
0:52:36,69 --> 0:52:38,93
but that doesn't make
the Germans feel better


1045
0:52:38,93 --> 0:52:41,82
about why you were going
after Angela Merkel's


1046
0:52:41,82 --> 0:52:43,48
messages, or the like.


1047
0:52:43,48 --> 0:52:47,23
And so the problem is it's
all of these things at once.


1048
0:52:47,23 --> 0:52:49,36
And it's muddied the
water of the discussions.


1049
0:52:49,36 --> 0:52:51,1
And we can even see
this most recently


1050
0:52:51,1 --> 0:52:54,44
in the President's speech,
which, again, focused primarily


1051
0:52:54,44 --> 0:52:57,88
on one of the buckets,
mostly the privacy side.


1052
0:52:57,88 --> 0:53:0,69
Because that's what matters
most in the American political


1053
0:53:0,69 --> 0:53:2,54
debate, but actually
may not matter


1054
0:53:2,54 --> 0:53:5,15
the most in the long
term national security


1055
0:53:5,15 --> 0:53:7,42
and economic prosperity
of the nation, which


1056
0:53:7,42 --> 0:53:11,5
is weird and scary to say.


1057
0:53:11,5 --> 0:53:14,54
AUDIENCE: Just a question on
how Silicon Valley companies can


1058
0:53:14,54 --> 0:53:18,27
partner with each other and
with the government to actually


1059
0:53:18,27 --> 0:53:20,79
have better government
surveillance policies, right?


1060
0:53:20,79 --> 0:53:23,735
Recently, we saw the
government surveillance reform,


1061
0:53:23,735 --> 0:53:25,61
where like seven companies
have got together.


1062
0:53:25,61 --> 0:53:28,31
And again, it's going back to
the notion of us versus them


1063
0:53:28,31 --> 0:53:29,97
where instead of
partnering, it's


1064
0:53:29,97 --> 0:53:33,5
now they're pushing
for like reforms,


1065
0:53:33,5 --> 0:53:35,491
and wasting lobbying
dollars and stuff while it


1066
0:53:35,491 --> 0:53:36,74
could be a better partnership.


1067
0:53:36,74 --> 0:53:41,64
So what are you thoughts
on what we could do?


1068
0:53:41,64 --> 0:53:44,16
PETER SINGER: There's
steps that can be taken.


1069
0:53:44,16 --> 0:53:48,14
But one of the underlying
things this is attitude.


1070
0:53:48,14 --> 0:53:54,68
And it's funny, I was out
here a little over a year ago.


1071
0:53:54,68 --> 0:53:59,53
And there was sort of
an attitude towards,


1072
0:53:59,53 --> 0:54:2,91
DC is so dysfunctional.


1073
0:54:2,91 --> 0:54:4,6
Nothing could get done there.


1074
0:54:4,6 --> 0:54:6,14
You guys are so problematic.


1075
0:54:6,14 --> 0:54:9,93
We don't want anything
to do with you.


1076
0:54:9,93 --> 0:54:12,89
And we don't need
anything to do with you.


1077
0:54:12,89 --> 0:54:16,2
And then now we see the flip
side of that of actually


1078
0:54:16,2 --> 0:54:18,78
what you do matters to us.


1079
0:54:18,78 --> 0:54:20,52
You're still dysfunctional.


1080
0:54:20,52 --> 0:54:22,88
But it matters to us.


1081
0:54:22,88 --> 0:54:28,68
And in turn, you saw that
approach from-- again,


1082
0:54:28,68 --> 0:54:34,24
this is from the stovepiping--
Individuals pursuing


1083
0:54:34,24 --> 0:54:42,6
a certain political goal, and
within just a limited circle,


1084
0:54:42,6 --> 0:54:45,71
not understanding the ripple
effects of what they were doing


1085
0:54:45,71 --> 0:54:48,33
on lots of other
areas including one


1086
0:54:48,33 --> 0:54:50,71
of the cornerstones of
American prosperity, which


1087
0:54:50,71 --> 0:54:53,24
is our technology industry.


1088
0:54:53,24 --> 0:54:57,275
So the problem is first
knocking down that attitude


1089
0:54:57,275 --> 0:55:0,75
that neither side
matters to the other


1090
0:55:0,75 --> 0:55:2,56
and doesn't need to
understand the other.


1091
0:55:2,56 --> 0:55:8,44



1092
0:55:8,44 --> 0:55:10,87
Too often, Silicon
Valley-- and even sort


1093
0:55:10,87 --> 0:55:16,5
of the reaction when I
said this in the speech


1094
0:55:16,5 --> 0:55:19,16
--will offer a seeming
technologic solution


1095
0:55:19,16 --> 0:55:22,3
to a problem.


1096
0:55:22,3 --> 0:55:25,17
There's far more
engineers out here


1097
0:55:25,17 --> 0:55:28,42
than almost any other specialty.


1098
0:55:28,42 --> 0:55:29,5
And so there's
often-- you know, we


1099
0:55:29,5 --> 0:55:32,79
can engineer our way out of
it some way, shape, or form.


1100
0:55:32,79 --> 0:55:38,15
And we even see that now in
this discussion over privacy


1101
0:55:38,15 --> 0:55:41,26
where it was OK, we can't
figure out what to do.


1102
0:55:41,26 --> 0:55:47,77
But Attorney General and Head
of National Intelligence,


1103
0:55:47,77 --> 0:55:51,2
you've got 60 days to
figure out this solution.


1104
0:55:51,2 --> 0:55:52,53
And we see different
sort of things


1105
0:55:52,53 --> 0:55:56,8
offered that are sort
of a technical solution.


1106
0:55:56,8 --> 0:55:59,655
It's not going to be
a technical solution.


1107
0:55:59,655 --> 0:56:4,6
It's going to be an awful,
painful grind of policy


1108
0:56:4,6 --> 0:56:7,71
and votes and court
decisions and lobbying


1109
0:56:7,71 --> 0:56:9,22
and all these other
things that go


1110
0:56:9,22 --> 0:56:14,5
into the nasty sausage
of political process.


1111
0:56:14,5 --> 0:56:17,19
But in turn, what I'm
getting at, too often


1112
0:56:17,19 --> 0:56:20,81
we fail to look at the human
side of what can be done.


1113
0:56:20,81 --> 0:56:23,41
And that would be
another aspect of it.


1114
0:56:23,41 --> 0:56:26,67
But the bottom
line is we clearly


1115
0:56:26,67 --> 0:56:28,67
have a shared stake in it.


1116
0:56:28,67 --> 0:56:33,14
And I hope we can raise
the level of discourse


1117
0:56:33,14 --> 0:56:35,93
and raise the level
of cooperation.


1118
0:56:35,93 --> 0:56:36,8
AUDIENCE: Hi, Peter.


1119
0:56:36,8 --> 0:56:38,424
Great to see the book
finally come out.


1120
0:56:38,424 --> 0:56:41,655
What are you optimistic about?


1121
0:56:41,655 --> 0:56:43,28
PETER SINGER: I
thought-- I mean, look,


1122
0:56:43,28 --> 0:56:50,16
I'm actually hugely
optimistic about-- I mean,


1123
0:56:50,16 --> 0:56:53,15
the possibilities of this
technology, what it's allowed


1124
0:56:53,15 --> 0:57:0,6
to accomplish, and in turn
the people who misuse it,


1125
0:57:0,6 --> 0:57:3,54
and what they're
costing themselves.


1126
0:57:3,54 --> 0:57:9,26
And that misuse is
everything from-- there's


1127
0:57:9,26 --> 0:57:13,9
a very real danger of the
balkanization of the internet.


1128
0:57:13,9 --> 0:57:18,83
On the other hand, the cost
of that to those nations,


1129
0:57:18,83 --> 0:57:21,65
it will be staggering.


1130
0:57:21,65 --> 0:57:25,29
A flip way of putting
it is, there's


1131
0:57:25,29 --> 0:57:27,17
one nation that has been
really, really great


1132
0:57:27,17 --> 0:57:29,85
cyber security
protections-- North Korea.


1133
0:57:29,85 --> 0:57:31,18
There's a cost to that.


1134
0:57:31,18 --> 0:57:34,3



1135
0:57:34,3 --> 0:57:37,99
And we can see this in turn
on the debate around the NSA


1136
0:57:37,99 --> 0:57:38,836
to businesses.


1137
0:57:38,836 --> 0:57:41,46
I gave all of these anecdotes of
how they're not doing it well,


1138
0:57:41,46 --> 0:57:43,62
but now they're
facing cost to it.


1139
0:57:43,62 --> 0:57:47,3
The recent examples of, be it
Target or Snapchat or Neiman


1140
0:57:47,3 --> 0:57:50,1
Marcus, is that there's
an ebb and flow.


1141
0:57:50,1 --> 0:57:53,49
And people that
mishandle it face costs.


1142
0:57:53,49 --> 0:57:56,25
And so to me, that's
where we'll see reactions.


1143
0:57:56,25 --> 0:57:59,7
The incentives will drive it.


1144
0:57:59,7 --> 0:58:1,55
If there's any
message from the book,


1145
0:58:1,55 --> 0:58:4,89
it's that this is
seemingly scary stuff.


1146
0:58:4,89 --> 0:58:6,72
And some of it should be scary.


1147
0:58:6,72 --> 0:58:10,4
But on the other hand, we
can't have a good discussion


1148
0:58:10,4 --> 0:58:13,17
if it's like Spinal Tap and
the volume's always at 11.


1149
0:58:13,17 --> 0:58:16,1
Which has been how
we've talked about it.


1150
0:58:16,1 --> 0:58:18,0
And so the goal of
the book was basically


1151
0:58:18,0 --> 0:58:20,94
to fill this kind of sweet
spot where you either


1152
0:58:20,94 --> 0:58:23,49
had this highly
technical discussion that


1153
0:58:23,49 --> 0:58:27,84
was exclusionary or you
had the histrionic side.


1154
0:58:27,84 --> 0:58:30,42
And instead, I think
this can be a topic--


1155
0:58:30,42 --> 0:58:33,22
I think it has to be a topic
that we're all better equipped


1156
0:58:33,22 --> 0:58:33,92
to talk about.


1157
0:58:33,92 --> 0:58:36,76
And I'm optimistic that
when we do understand this,


1158
0:58:36,76 --> 0:58:41,546
we can go much further than
where we're at right now.


1159
0:58:41,546 --> 0:58:43,93
MALE SPEAKER: And on
this optimistic note,


1160
0:58:43,93 --> 0:58:46,5
please give a hand
to Peter Singer.


1161
0:58:46,5 --> 0:60:46,5
