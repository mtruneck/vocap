- Hey, dad.


3
0:0:6,126 --> 0:0:7,394
- Are those my old video tapes?


4
0:0:7,394 --> 0:0:8,395
- Yep.


5
0:0:8,395 --> 0:0:9,563
- Where'd you guys find those?


6
0:0:9,563 --> 0:0:10,53
- In the attic.


7
0:0:10,53 --> 0:0:11,932
- What were you doing
in the attic?


8
0:0:11,932 --> 0:0:15,368

0:0:20,273 --> 0:0:21,274
- What's that?


13
0:0:21,274 --> 0:0:23,877
- One of the tv shows
of the '90s.

Look, I can't believe
you guys never heard of it.

Anyway, this was one of the
top tv shows on the networks


22

for, like, six years.


23
0:0:44,831 --> 0:0:48,34

used to be on network tv?


24

0:0:50,3 --> 0:0:52,439
Both: Wow.


26
0:0:52,439 --> 0:0:54,808
- We had sitcoms, cartoons.


27
0:0:54,808 --> 0:0:57,177
I mean, there were so many
black shows on tv,


28
0:0:57,177 --> 0:0:59,45
they ran out of actors
and started using puppets.


29
0:0:59,45 --> 0:1:1,348
There was this show called
<i>cousin Skeeter.</i>


30
0:1:1,348 --> 0:1:3,55
- Yeah, I think
I remember that one.


31
0:1:3,55 --> 0:1:7,187
I always wondered
why his mouth was so wide.


32
0:1:7,187 --> 0:1:8,488
- Hold on.

0:1:12,626 --> 0:1:13,86
- Wow.


37
0:1:13,86 --> 0:1:18,832
And I thought having
a black president was huge.


38
0:1:18,832 --> 0:1:21,1
These tapes are gigantic.


39
0:1:21,1 --> 0:1:23,69
- It's what we watched
before DVDs.


40
0:1:23,69 --> 0:1:24,37
- Why?


41
0:1:24,37 --> 0:1:25,905
- Because there were no DVDs.


42
0:1:25,905 --> 0:1:27,641
- Well, can we watch
some of them?


43
0:1:27,641 --> 0:1:28,608

47
0:1:32,746 --> 0:1:34,848

or are you that young?

Both: Both.

Baby, you can still go.

0:2:56,96 --> 0:2:59,99
Just take one of your boys.


92

one of the boys.

204
0:7:3,31 --> 0:7:4,9
[Laughter]


205
0:7:4,9 --> 0:7:7,336
- So you really must have
messed something up


206
0:7:7,336 --> 0:7:9,505
to be dressing like that
on a weeknight.


207
0:7:9,505 --> 0:7:10,939
- Now, why would you say that?


208
0:7:10,939 --> 0:7:12,808
- Oh, girl, please,
I had a husband.


209
0:7:12,808 --> 0:7:15,611
I know a "I'm sorry" dress
when I see one.


210
0:7:15,611 --> 0:7:17,379
- Don't listen to her, baby.


211
0:7:17,379 --> 0:7:19,648
You look incredible.


212
0:7:19,648 --> 0:7:20,983
- Thank you.


213
0:7:20,983 --> 0:7:22,618
You know, we better get going,


214
0:7:22,618 --> 0:7:24,486
or we just might not
make it out.


215
0:7:24,486 --> 0:7:25,454
- Ooh.


216
0:7:25,454 --> 0:7:27,22
[Laughter]


217
0:7:27,22 --> 0:7:28,29
- Ugh!


218
0:7:28,29 --> 0:7:29,958
I mean, see you later.


219
0:7:29,958 --> 0:7:30,993
- See you later.


220
0:7:30,993 --> 0:7:38,867
- Don't bring no babies
back up in here.


221
0:7:38,867 --> 0:7:42,237
- All right.


222
0:7:42,237 --> 0:7:44,706
I am ready.


223
0:7:44,706 --> 0:7:46,41
- Me too.


224
0:7:46,41 --> 0:7:48,343
- Let's get settled in.


225
0:7:48,343 --> 0:7:49,945
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.


226
0:7:49,945 --> 0:7:53,916
Before we leave, I made some
mood music for our date.


227
0:7:53,916 --> 0:7:55,551
It keeps with the theme.


228
0:7:55,551 --> 0:7:56,818
- A theme?
- Mm-Hmm.


229
0:7:56,818 --> 0:7:59,588
- Oh, that's nice.


230
0:7:59,588 --> 0:8:1,256
[Smooth R&B beat]


231
0:8:1,256 --> 0:8:2,724
Ooh, I like that.


232
0:8:2,724 --> 0:8:3,725
You think of everything.


233
0:8:3,725 --> 0:8:6,61
[Laughter]


234
0:8:6,61 --> 0:8:7,496
So what are we doing?


235
0:8:7,496 --> 0:8:9,565
- Oh, well, at 7:00,


236
0:8:9,565 --> 0:8:11,4
we'll check in
for our reservation.


237
0:8:11,4 --> 0:8:13,201
By 7:15, we'll have drinks.


238
0:8:13,201 --> 0:8:15,904
After some small talk
and some light banter,


239
0:8:15,904 --> 0:8:19,107
we'll share an intimate kiss
and then order our appetizers.


240
0:8:19,107 --> 0:8:21,176
I figure that'll take us
through about 8:00,


241
0:8:21,176 --> 0:8:23,245
and then we'll put in
our entree order


242
0:8:23,245 --> 0:8:25,881
and then some
restaurant-appropriate PDA.


243
0:8:25,881 --> 0:8:27,783
- Personal digital assistant?


244
0:8:27,783 --> 0:8:29,952
- Public displays of affection.


245
0:8:29,952 --> 0:8:31,52
- Oh, okay.


246
0:8:31,52 --> 0:8:32,588
- And then after that,


247
0:8:32,588 --> 0:8:34,823
we can just play
the rest of the evening by ear.


248
0:8:34,823 --> 0:8:37,292
- Oh, just completely
off the cuff.


249
0:8:37,292 --> 0:8:39,728
- Oh, you know, see if we
want to order dessert or not.


250
0:8:39,728 --> 0:8:40,862
Mm.


251
0:8:40,862 --> 0:8:42,598
- Oh, you are totally
out of control, girl.


252
0:8:42,598 --> 0:8:43,599
- Whoo, I'm wild!


253
0:8:43,599 --> 0:8:45,901
[Laughter]


254
0:8:45,901 --> 0:8:47,269
- So where we going?


255
0:8:47,269 --> 0:8:56,912
- Oh, honey, you don't have to
worry about that.


256
0:8:56,912 --> 0:8:58,246
- Hi, honey.


257
0:8:58,246 --> 0:8:59,615
- Good morning.


258
0:8:59,615 --> 0:9:1,583
- So that was good last night,
right?


259
0:9:1,583 --> 0:9:2,584
- Hmm?


260
0:9:2,584 --> 0:9:5,12
- I said, last night
was nice, right?


261
0:9:5,12 --> 0:9:7,556
- It was cool.


262
0:9:7,556 --> 0:9:9,324
- Did you just give me
the high voice?


263
0:9:9,324 --> 0:9:10,525
- No.


264
0:9:10,525 --> 0:9:12,394
- Are you seriously
gonna stand there


265
0:9:12,394 --> 0:9:13,562
with a straight face


266
0:9:13,562 --> 0:9:15,197
and lie to me about giving me
the high voice


267
0:9:15,197 --> 0:9:16,198
in the high voice?


268
0:9:16,198 --> 0:9:17,799
- I am not giving you
the high voice.


269
0:9:17,799 --> 0:9:20,35
- Nick, if you
didn't like our date,


270
0:9:20,35 --> 0:9:22,404
you can just tell me.


271
0:9:22,404 --> 0:9:26,675
- Baby, the other night,
I was looking for excitement.


272
0:9:26,675 --> 0:9:28,51
Knife was
a once-in-a-lifetime night,


273
0:9:28,51 --> 0:9:29,645
and we missed it.


274
0:9:29,645 --> 0:9:32,514
- But our evening was romantic.


275
0:9:32,514 --> 0:9:35,45
- It was perfectly planned.


276
0:9:35,45 --> 0:9:36,652
- You liked dinner, right?


277
0:9:36,652 --> 0:9:38,2
- Planned.


278
0:9:38,2 --> 0:9:40,188
- Didn't you love
the walk along the pier?


279
0:9:40,188 --> 0:9:41,857
- Planned.


280
0:9:41,857 --> 0:9:42,991
- What about when we got home?


281
0:9:42,991 --> 0:9:46,61
That wasn't planned;
That was good.


282
0:9:46,61 --> 0:9:47,195
- It was cool.


283
0:9:47,195 --> 0:9:48,597
- [Gasps]


284
0:9:48,597 --> 0:9:50,799
Well, you better remember
how cool it was,


285
0:9:50,799 --> 0:9:53,468
because that's the last
you'll see of that.


286
0:9:53,468 --> 0:10:2,944
You can plan on it.


287
0:10:2,944 --> 0:10:4,178
- Date night?


288
0:10:4,178 --> 0:10:5,68
What are you, 70?


289
0:10:5,68 --> 0:10:8,15
- The only reason
I had to plan a date night


290
0:10:8,15 --> 0:10:9,25
is because of you.


291
0:10:9,25 --> 0:10:11,18
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to knife?


292
0:10:11,18 --> 0:10:12,386
You didn't think
I wanted to come?


293
0:10:12,386 --> 0:10:14,355
- Well, the guy called me
that afternoon.


294
0:10:14,355 --> 0:10:18,192
It's not my fault your husband
don't know how to use a phone.


295
0:10:18,192 --> 0:10:21,462
- You realize I can fire you.


296
0:10:21,462 --> 0:10:23,564
- Suzanne, I have told you
many times,


297
0:10:23,564 --> 0:10:25,399
you need to learn
to be flexible.


298
0:10:25,399 --> 0:10:27,268
Be spontaneous.


299
0:10:27,268 --> 0:10:28,836
Throw caution to the wind.


300
0:10:28,836 --> 0:10:31,72
- The last time
I was spontaneous,


301
0:10:31,72 --> 0:10:32,507
I ended up with Kevin.


302
0:10:32,507 --> 0:10:33,841
- What about Lindsey?


303
0:10:33,841 --> 0:10:38,346
- That's when I threw caution
to the wind.


304
0:10:38,346 --> 0:10:40,748
- Listen, I can go to the moon
on a moment's notice.


305
0:10:40,748 --> 0:10:43,5
You send a rocket,
some gravity boots,


306
0:10:43,5 --> 0:10:46,12
and some moon luggage,
I'm good to go.


307
0:10:46,12 --> 0:10:47,88
All right, zee.


308
0:10:47,88 --> 0:10:48,189
- Mm.


309
0:10:48,189 --> 0:10:49,991
- I'm a let you in
on a little secret.


310
0:10:49,991 --> 0:10:51,259
- What?


311
0:10:51,259 --> 0:10:54,95
- People like me
count on people like you


312
0:10:54,95 --> 0:10:56,664
to be boring
so we can have all the fun.


313
0:10:56,664 --> 0:10:59,3
If more married people
took the ticket to the game,


314
0:10:59,3 --> 0:11:0,234
to the concert,


315
0:11:0,234 --> 0:11:1,669
the reservation
to the restaurant,


316
0:11:1,669 --> 0:11:3,938
single people wouldn't have
half the places to go.


317
0:11:3,938 --> 0:11:8,743
Half the things I do are because
married people turn 'em down.


318
0:11:8,743 --> 0:11:11,379
Listen, when I told you
I was going out,


319
0:11:11,379 --> 0:11:13,514
you didn't even ask me
where I was going,


320
0:11:13,514 --> 0:11:16,15
because you didn't think you had
anything better to do


321
0:11:16,15 --> 0:11:17,585
than to go home.


322
0:11:17,585 --> 0:11:20,121
- Well, as far as I knew,
I didn't.


323
0:11:20,121 --> 0:11:21,289
- The point is,


324
0:11:21,289 --> 0:11:24,492
you missed out on an amazing
grand opening party,


325
0:11:24,492 --> 0:11:28,83
and if you keep on trying
to plan every single thing,


326
0:11:28,83 --> 0:11:34,101
Suzanne, you're gonna
miss out on life.


327
0:11:34,101 --> 0:11:38,639
- You've got a point.


328
0:11:38,639 --> 0:11:40,74
- Where are you going?


329
0:11:40,74 --> 0:11:41,8
- Out.


330
0:11:41,8 --> 0:11:42,276
You can handle this stuff,
right?


331
0:11:42,276 --> 0:11:43,344
- Oh, no.
No, I can't.


332
0:11:43,344 --> 0:11:44,412
This is gonna take hours,


333
0:11:44,412 --> 0:11:46,714
and I was planning on
going out tonight.


334
0:11:46,714 --> 0:11:48,983
- Well, that's what you get
for planning.


335
0:11:48,983 --> 0:11:49,984
Bye.


336
0:11:49,984 --> 0:11:50,985
- [Laughs]


337
0:11:50,985 --> 0:11:51,986
You funny.


338
0:11:51,986 --> 0:11:56,324
Bye.


339
0:11:56,324 --> 0:11:58,392
- [Laughs]


340
0:11:58,392 --> 0:11:59,293
- Hey.


341
0:11:59,293 --> 0:12:0,361
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, dad.


342
0:12:0,361 --> 0:12:1,529
- Hey, Mr. Kingston-persons.


343
0:12:1,529 --> 0:12:2,63
- Hey, Troy.


344
0:12:2,63 --> 0:12:4,899
You guys still watching
<i>a different world?</i>


345
0:12:4,899 --> 0:12:7,235
- I've been hooked on this show
for years.


346
0:12:7,235 --> 0:12:9,637
I've seen every episode.


347
0:12:9,637 --> 0:12:10,905
- This show is amazing.


348
0:12:10,905 --> 0:12:12,773
It makes me want to go
to a black university.


349
0:12:12,773 --> 0:12:15,476
- Me too.
- Me too.


350
0:12:15,476 --> 0:12:17,411
- I think that's
what Dr. cosby intended.


351
0:12:17,411 --> 0:12:19,647
- What's really cool
is that this show's hilarious,


352
0:12:19,647 --> 0:12:21,582
but the story lines
address serious issues


353
0:12:21,582 --> 0:12:23,217
like class and race relations.


354
0:12:23,217 --> 0:12:25,86
- That's thanks to Debbie Allen.


355
0:12:25,86 --> 0:12:27,21
- I just care about
the hilarious part.


356
0:12:27,21 --> 0:12:28,256
- And I love whitley.


357
0:12:28,256 --> 0:12:29,857
I think she should marry
Dwayne Wayne.


358
0:12:29,857 --> 0:12:30,892
- Well...


359
0:12:30,892 --> 0:12:34,996
- Hey, let it unfold.


360
0:12:34,996 --> 0:12:37,64
- They should remake this show
with Nick Cannon.


361
0:12:37,64 --> 0:12:40,468
Both: Yeah.


362
0:12:40,468 --> 0:12:42,169
- So what's up with the outfits?


363
0:12:42,169 --> 0:12:43,704
- Well, I'm Dwayne Wayne.


364
0:12:43,704 --> 0:12:45,506
- I'm Ron Johnson.


365
0:12:45,506 --> 0:12:48,175
- They tried to get me to dress
up as waiter oakes.


366
0:12:48,175 --> 0:12:50,278
- Sinbad.


367
0:12:50,278 --> 0:12:52,146
- I told her
she should be honored.


368
0:12:52,146 --> 0:12:53,881
Sinbad is a national treasure.


369
0:12:53,881 --> 0:12:55,416
You can have
your Martin Lawrence


370
0:12:55,416 --> 0:12:56,384
and your Steve Harvey.


371
0:12:56,384 --> 0:12:58,886
I'll take Sinbad any day.


372
0:12:58,886 --> 0:13:0,554
- We looked at some of his clips
on YouTube.


373
0:13:0,554 --> 0:13:1,889
He's hilarious.


374
0:13:1,889 --> 0:13:3,457
- You know, I think I may have


375
0:13:3,457 --> 0:13:5,493
one of Sindbad’s comedy shows
in here.


376
0:13:5,493 --> 0:13:11,299
- Please tell me
it's <i>brain damaged.</i>


377
0:13:11,299 --> 0:13:12,967
- <i>Brain damaged.</i>


378
0:13:12,967 --> 0:13:14,235
Bam!


379
0:13:14,235 --> 0:13:16,27
- Nice.


380
0:13:16,27 --> 0:13:18,105
His bit on weaves is a classic.


381
0:13:18,105 --> 0:13:19,774
"There's nothing wrong
with a weave,


382
0:13:19,774 --> 0:13:21,575
but at least try
to fool someone."


383
0:13:21,575 --> 0:13:23,511
Genius.


384
0:13:23,511 --> 0:13:25,12
- Don't leave that
on pause too long.


385
0:13:25,12 --> 0:13:27,648
It'll break the tape.


386
0:13:27,648 --> 0:13:36,757
- [Laughs]


387
0:13:36,757 --> 0:13:37,925
- Hey, baby.


388
0:13:37,925 --> 0:13:39,226
- Nick, I...


389
0:13:39,226 --> 0:13:43,264
- Before you speak,
I just want to say I'm sorry.


390
0:13:43,264 --> 0:13:45,499
I was so busy
worrying about that party,


391
0:13:45,499 --> 0:13:48,169
I let it get in the way
of our night.


392
0:13:48,169 --> 0:13:50,137
I shouldn't have done that,


393
0:13:50,137 --> 0:13:51,372
and I want you to know


394
0:13:51,372 --> 0:13:54,909
that I'll go on a date night
with you any time.


395
0:13:54,909 --> 0:13:55,91
- Good.


396
0:13:55,91 --> 0:13:57,44
