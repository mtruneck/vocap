BILL BRYANT: Well, the old adage
that we go by is, if you


3
0:0:36,92 --> 0:0:38,61
have a chance to top
off, top off.


4
0:0:38,61 --> 0:0:41,26
And sometimes just because you
can make it 150 miles on a


5
0:0:41,26 --> 0:0:43,516
tank, you don't know if the gas
station at the other end


6
0:0:43,516 --> 0:0:45,37
of that 100 miles is really
going to be open or


7
0:0:45,37 --> 0:0:50,1
functioning, and we planned
ahead for that.


8
0:0:50,1 --> 0:0:51,3
Buy gas off the locals.


9
0:0:51,3 --> 0:0:56,6
And I only see them every year
or two or whatever, but


10
0:0:56,6 --> 0:0:58,0
they're pretty consistently
there.


11
0:0:58,0 --> 0:1:0,7
It's probably the same guys--
probably has been forever.

14
0:1:16,995 --> 0:1:19,34
KEEGAN SAUDER: At first when I
actually heard that we had a


15
0:1:19,34 --> 0:1:21,41
guide, I was kind of
like, oh really?


16
0:1:21,41 --> 0:1:23,14
We have a guide?


17
0:1:23,14 --> 0:1:26,2
I think it could be pretty easy,
but it's actually been


18
0:1:26,2 --> 0:1:27,16
really good having those guys.


19
0:1:27,16 --> 0:1:30,3
Because they've done this
before, and you


20
0:1:30,3 --> 0:1:31,45
might run out of gas.


21
0:1:31,45 --> 0:1:33,98
BILL BRYANT: I was trying to
get it all from one guy.


22
0:1:33,98 --> 0:1:36,165
But there's two dudes that are
splitting this territory, so


23
0:1:36,165 --> 0:1:37,44
he doesn't want to cock
block the other dude.


24
0:1:37,44 --> 0:1:40,94
So we've made it more
complicated.


25
0:1:40,94 --> 0:1:45,5
ARTO SAARI: Well, we might be
shit out of luck around here.


26
0:1:45,5 --> 0:1:48,78
This might be the
two only guys.


27
0:1:48,78 --> 0:1:52,71
I think we'd fucking be in
some severe trouble or


28
0:1:52,71 --> 0:1:56,35
somewhere in the gutter
if it wasn't for Bill.


29
0:1:56,35 --> 0:1:58,3
I can't wait for
your interview.


30
0:1:58,3 --> 0:2:0,545
It's like, he's these
fucking kooks, man.


31
0:2:0,545 --> 0:2:5,76
These fucking monkeys think
they're riding bikes and shit.


32
0:2:5,76 --> 0:2:8,37
KYNAN TAIT: He seems like he has
a pretty good tolerance.


33
0:2:8,37 --> 0:2:11,79
I know he gets fed up having to
wait for everyone, because


34
0:2:11,79 --> 0:2:15,405
we do so much waiting
at gas stations.


35
0:2:15,405 --> 0:2:16,86
BILL BRYANT: I'm just
kind of driven.


36
0:2:16,86 --> 0:2:18,64
I want to get up early, I want
to hit the road, I want to get


37
0:2:18,64 --> 0:2:19,27
my miles done.


38
0:2:19,27 --> 0:2:21,24
In case there's a problem, I
want to be working on it in


39
0:2:21,24 --> 0:2:21,89
the daylight.


40
0:2:21,89 --> 0:2:24,12
And so guys would kind of do
their own thing and some would


41
0:2:24,12 --> 0:2:27,14
want to go faster and some
slower and that kind of thing


42
0:2:27,14 --> 0:2:29,38
and it complicates
the movement.


43
0:2:29,38 --> 0:2:34,38



44
0:2:34,38 --> 0:2:37,2
HIME HERBERT: Yeah, he
doesn't like waiting.


45
0:2:37,2 --> 0:2:39,12
We did the other ride, he's
be like OK, get your gas.


46
0:2:39,12 --> 0:2:40,37
OK, let's go.

HEATH KIRCHART: I like
riding by myself.


49
0:2:45,27 --> 0:2:47,46
I like riding a motorcycle
by myself.


50
0:2:47,46 --> 0:2:50,62
I like being completely alone
and doing whatever I want.


51
0:2:50,62 --> 0:2:53,77
So I like to break off
and be on my own.


52
0:2:53,77 --> 0:2:56,53



53
0:2:56,53 --> 0:3:2,245
KEEGAN SAUDER: He definitely has
kind of the lone wolf kind


54
0:3:2,245 --> 0:3:5,42
of air about him.


55
0:3:5,42 --> 0:3:8,645
Just sitting off in the shade
like, I've already got gas, I


56
0:3:8,645 --> 0:3:11,115
was here a half hour
ago, I'm ready.


57
0:3:11,115 --> 0:3:14,97
He doesn't care if he rides
500 miles, I don't think.


58
0:3:14,97 --> 0:3:16,945
He would just do it.


59
0:3:16,945 --> 0:3:19,5
PATRICK O'DELL: Like honestly,
if it was just me and Heath on


60
0:3:19,5 --> 0:3:23,165
this trip, or if it was just
Heath, turns where we went


61
0:3:23,165 --> 0:3:24,34
into San Ignacio--


62
0:3:24,34 --> 0:3:25,59
that wouldn't happen.


63
0:3:25,59 --> 0:3:37,204



64
0:3:37,204 --> 0:3:41,48
HEATH KIRCHART: I mean, it's
gets from OK to epic as you


65
0:3:41,48 --> 0:3:46,925
slowly get down closer
to the bottom.


66
0:3:46,925 --> 0:3:50,142
KEEGAN SAUDER: This is the
closest thing to an oasis I


67
0:3:50,142 --> 0:3:53,37
think I've ever seen, except
for pictures of them in


68
0:3:53,37 --> 0:3:57,3
"National Geographic." It only
lasts for a few miles, and


69
0:3:57,3 --> 0:3:58,18
then it's gone.


70
0:3:58,18 --> 0:4:0,118
Pretty awesome little spot.


71
0:4:0,118 --> 0:4:3,112



72
0:4:3,112 --> 0:4:7,62
BILL BRYANT: True Baja, to me,
really starts in San Ignacio.


73
0:4:7,62 --> 0:4:9,575
It just feels like
authentic Baja.


74
0:4:9,575 --> 0:4:13,25
There's handpainted signs and
things that look exactly like


75
0:4:13,25 --> 0:4:15,56
they looked when I saw
them 20 years ago.


76
0:4:15,56 --> 0:4:46,612
And they probably look exactly
like they looked 50 years ago.


77
0:4:46,612 --> 0:4:50,85
KEEGAN SAUDER: At the end of
September I just put two small


78
0:4:50,85 --> 0:4:52,83
fractures near the toes.


79
0:4:52,83 --> 0:4:56,22
Skating makes it sore, or doing
too many doughnuts on


80
0:4:56,22 --> 0:4:57,443
the motorcycle.


81
0:4:57,443 --> 0:5:1,84
So the doctor said just keep
trying to not do anything that


82
0:5:1,84 --> 0:5:3,55
makes it hurt and you'll
get better.


83
0:5:3,55 --> 0:5:8,83



84
0:5:8,83 --> 0:5:11,65
KEEGAN SAUDER: I'm sure I have
at some point in person.


85
0:5:11,65 --> 0:5:14,42



86
0:5:14,42 --> 0:5:15,56
Oh, wait, OK.


87
0:5:15,56 --> 0:5:20,23
We're going to go way back to
1994, when Foundation did a


88
0:5:20,23 --> 0:5:22,655
demo in my hometown
in Nelson, BC.


89
0:5:22,655 --> 0:5:24,94
I saw him skate then.


90
0:5:24,94 --> 0:5:27,76
He was probably 15.


91
0:5:27,76 --> 0:5:28,7
He's sick.


92
0:5:28,7 --> 0:5:29,32
Sick Kirchart.


93
0:5:29,32 --> 0:5:42,98



94
0:5:42,98 --> 0:5:48,516
Arto's actually kind a similar
vibe to friends from Canada


95
0:5:48,516 --> 0:5:51,282
and Australia that I've been
on motorcycle trips with.


96
0:5:51,282 --> 0:5:54,18



97
0:5:54,18 --> 0:5:57,178
You know, that get in the
water kind of attitude.


98
0:5:57,178 --> 0:5:58,675
Just go for it.


99
0:5:58,675 --> 0:6:5,67



100
0:6:5,67 --> 0:6:9,24
Just trying to get as epic
as possible at all times.


101

102
0:6:27,796 --> 0:6:30,49

we've ever ruined a more


103
0:6:30,49 --> 0:6:36,381
ancient skate spot, which
is kind of awesome.

the local church.


106
0:6:49,7 --> 0:6:51,885
Let's go have a look inside,
see what they got.


107
0:6:51,885 --> 0:6:57,145



108
0:6:57,145 --> 0:7:0,665
ARTO SAARI: Not so much.


109
0:7:0,665 --> 0:7:2,77
The ceilings looks
pretty cool.


110
0:7:2,77 --> 0:7:4,415
Must have been so
hard to build.


111
0:7:4,415 --> 0:7:19,75



112
0:7:19,75 --> 0:7:22,565
HIME HERBERT: I had sex
with a lot of hookers.


113
0:7:22,565 --> 0:7:23,87
ARTO SAARI: Go on my child.


114
0:7:23,87 --> 0:7:26,115
HIME HERBERT: And did
tons of blow.


115
0:7:26,115 --> 0:7:27,59
ARTO SAARI: Oh, it's
all right.


116
0:7:27,59 --> 0:7:28,88
Jesus forgives you--


117
0:7:28,88 --> 0:7:29,64
HIME HERBERT: Thank God.


118
0:7:29,64 --> 0:7:30,89
ARTO SAARI: --for such things.


119
0:7:30,89 --> 0:7:32,142
How much was the coke?


120
0:7:32,142 --> 0:7:34,46
HIME HERBERT: I forget.


121
0:7:34,46 --> 0:7:36,143
The hooker was expensive
though.


122
0:7:36,143 --> 0:7:38,95
ARTO SAARI: You probably
got ripped off.


123
0:7:38,95 --> 0:7:40,25
Just don't do it again.


124
0:7:40,25 --> 0:7:41,11
HIME HERBERT: All right.


125
0:7:41,11 --> 0:7:43,185
Hail Mary, full of grace?


126
0:7:43,185 --> 0:7:44,435
ARTO SAARI: Hail Mary.

corner of this place.

we'll be able to party
with the locals.

136

KYNAN TAIT: San Ignacio
was the first


137
0:9:14,65 --> 0:9:17,855
legitimate camp spot.


138
0:9:17,855 --> 0:9:21,9
And we showed up and it
was just this dirt--


139
0:9:21,9 --> 0:9:24,41



140
0:9:24,41 --> 0:9:27,56
I don't know, just
this dirt lot.

looks a little bit


143
0:9:31,77 --> 0:9:36,98
un-epic, if I must say.

Make your bed.


145

look like a campground.

a massive hurricane here in

has been flooded.


148
0:9:46,29 --> 0:9:47,68
You're welcome to explore.


149
0:9:47,68 --> 0:9:48,82
This is what there is.


150
0:9:48,82 --> 0:9:51,15
I mean, I went to the other
campground that he had picked


151
0:9:51,15 --> 0:9:53,46
originally and there was no
way you could get into it.


152
0:9:53,46 --> 0:9:56,523
It was just palm trees and
sand and rocks and stuff.

So this is kind of
where we're at.

How hard is it to party?

KYNAN TAIT: It was
kind of a weird


181
0:11:30,17 --> 0:11:31,47
scene in the town square.


182
0:11:31,47 --> 0:11:35,53
There was like all these old
guys sitting in these line of


183
0:11:35,53 --> 0:11:39,16
chairs watching a boxing
match on TV.

boxing right here.

that, I was like oh, we


194
0:12:9,63 --> 0:12:11,23
need to get involved in this.


195
0:12:11,23 --> 0:12:12,87

a part of this.

Because I was like I want to
box, but I don't want to be


204
0:12:33,47 --> 0:12:36,33
the guy that's like,
I want to box.


205
0:12:36,33 --> 0:12:39,76
But they just kind of like
put the gloves on me.


206
0:12:39,76 --> 0:12:42,67
I just don't want to
fight that one guy.


207
0:12:42,67 --> 0:12:44,3
No Carlos!


208
0:12:44,3 --> 0:12:45,55
No!


209
0:12:45,55 --> 0:12:48,295



210
0:12:48,295 --> 0:12:49,21
HARVEY FOSTER: Too late!


211
0:12:49,21 --> 0:12:49,94
Too late!


212
0:12:49,94 --> 0:12:50,796
Too late!


213
0:12:50,796 --> 0:12:52,3
Who am I getting?


214
0:12:52,3 --> 0:12:53,28
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


215
0:12:53,28 --> 0:12:57,982



216
0:12:57,982 --> 0:12:59,47
HEATH KIRCHART: [INAUDIBLE],
man.


217
0:12:59,47 --> 0:13:5,918



218
0:13:5,918 --> 0:13:7,4
Is he making fun of me?


219
0:13:7,4 --> 0:13:30,2



220
0:13:30,2 --> 0:13:31,29
You got me.


221
0:13:31,29 --> 0:13:34,2



222
0:13:34,2 --> 0:13:35,78
MALE SPEAKER: What happened
to your finger?


223
0:13:35,78 --> 0:13:37,43
HEATH KIRCHART: No, he
hit me in the nose.


224
0:13:37,43 --> 0:13:42,545



225
0:13:42,545 --> 0:13:44,55
HARVEY FOSTER: He's kicked
the shit out of Carlos.


226
0:13:44,55 --> 0:13:46,72
Do you guys remember when
he was telling me to


227
0:13:46,72 --> 0:13:47,405
fight the kid after?


228
0:13:47,405 --> 0:13:48,89
I was like, what?


229
0:13:48,89 --> 0:13:49,635
No, dude.


230
0:13:49,635 --> 0:13:51,98
I'll actually get beat up.


231
0:13:51,98 --> 0:13:54,8
There's going to be like all
these kids beating us up.


232
0:13:54,8 --> 0:13:55,61
That was pretty fun.


233
0:13:55,61 --> 0:14:1,47
And we waited like two
hours for our food.


234
0:14:1,47 --> 0:14:3,404
But that was all right, because
we all got drunk.


235
0:14:3,404 --> 0:14:5,14
MALE SPEAKER: You held
your own, man.


236
0:14:5,14 --> 0:14:6,1
You had him going.


237
0:14:6,1 --> 0:14:6,6
HEATH KIRCHART: I did not.


238
0:14:6,6 --> 0:14:7,7
I thought I'd get knocked out.


239
0:14:7,7 --> 0:14:8,61
MALE SPEAKER: You didn't
get knocked down.


240
0:14:8,61 --> 0:14:10,59
You stumbled one time,
that was it.


241
0:14:10,59 --> 0:16:10,59
