0:0:1,976 --> 0:0:4,14
FEMALE SPEAKER: Emma Clark
is a 25 year old YouTube


3
0:0:4,14 --> 0:0:6,51
celebrity and Twilight
obsessive.


4
0:0:6,51 --> 0:0:9,64
Posting under the username Nutty
Madam, her recent video


5
0:0:9,64 --> 0:0:11,7
on Kristen Stewart's infidelity
has reached 2 and


6
0:0:11,7 --> 0:0:14,729
1/2 million views so far.


7
0:0:14,729 --> 0:0:17,67
EMMA CLARK: I can't believe
she would do this.


8
0:0:17,67 --> 0:0:19,47
FEMALE SPEAKER: RPattz and I
went to Carlisle to meet the


9
0:0:19,47 --> 0:0:21,77
girl behind the meme.


10
0:0:21,77 --> 0:0:26,434
[THEME MUSIC]


11
0:0:26,434 --> 0:0:27,895
EMMA CLARK: Oh my God.


12
0:0:27,895 --> 0:0:30,817
Oh [INAUDIBLE].


13
0:0:30,817 --> 0:0:35,38
FEMALE SPEAKER: So what were
your main interests, and what


14
0:0:35,38 --> 0:0:39,5
was your life like before
Twilight, if you can give me a


15
0:0:39,5 --> 0:0:40,7
bit of an Emma Clark biog?


16
0:0:40,7 --> 0:0:42,53
EMMA CLARK: I didn't
enjoy my work.


17
0:0:42,53 --> 0:0:44,423
I didn't have much
of a social life.


18
0:0:44,423 --> 0:0:48,21
And then all of a sudden, there
was just like, videos


19
0:0:48,21 --> 0:0:51,0
and then friends and
then people who I


20
0:0:51,0 --> 0:0:52,3
shared interests with.


21
0:0:52,3 --> 0:0:53,59
And I'd just never
had that before.


22
0:0:53,59 --> 0:0:55,95
My whole life is built around
it, and I love it.


23
0:0:55,95 --> 0:0:58,673
I love the fact that I've just
got such a brilliant life that


24
0:0:58,673 --> 0:0:59,3
I never had before.


25
0:0:59,3 --> 0:1:1,57
And it's so refreshing.


26
0:1:1,57 --> 0:1:3,0
You get rubbish from
people, as well.


27
0:1:3,0 --> 0:1:5,39
People say, oh, you fat
this and you fat that.


28
0:1:5,39 --> 0:1:6,6
And it's fine.


29
0:1:6,6 --> 0:1:9,67
They're still watching the
video, so it's fine.


30
0:1:9,67 --> 0:1:12,31
FEMALE SPEAKER: So we're
off to Chez Emma now.


31
0:1:12,31 --> 0:1:14,8
Maybe I'm going to become
a Twihard like you.


32
0:1:14,8 --> 0:1:15,27
EMMA CLARK: Do it.


33
0:1:15,27 --> 0:1:15,94
Do it.


34
0:1:15,94 --> 0:1:19,1
FEMALE SPEAKER: Your tattoo
isn't Twilight-related, is it?


35
0:1:19,1 --> 0:1:20,56
EMMA CLARK: It stands for
bullshit, to remind me never


36
0:1:20,56 --> 0:1:22,18
to ever put up with any.


37
0:1:22,18 --> 0:1:24,97
And it stands for Bella Swan
and Buffy Summers.


38
0:1:24,97 --> 0:1:26,82
And be safe and be
strong, which


39
0:1:26,82 --> 0:1:28,9
are quotes from Twilight.


40
0:1:28,9 --> 0:1:29,56
Come in.


41
0:1:29,56 --> 0:1:31,66
FEMALE SPEAKER: So this is
where the magic happens.


42
0:1:31,66 --> 0:1:34,2
What do you do to psych yourself
up before you're


43
0:1:34,2 --> 0:1:35,255
making a vlog?


44
0:1:35,255 --> 0:1:37,69
EMMA CLARK: I find it helps if
I'm angry when I start making


45
0:1:37,69 --> 0:1:40,33
a video, because then it's
easier to kind of-- grrr.


46
0:1:40,33 --> 0:1:41,23
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


47
0:1:41,23 --> 0:1:44,445
And do you script any of it,
or is it all of the cuff?


48
0:1:44,445 --> 0:1:47,0
EMMA CLARK: Just press record
and whatever happens, happens.


49
0:1:47,0 --> 0:1:49,465
And if it's rubbish, then I
deliberately won't edit it


50
0:1:49,465 --> 0:1:51,55
out, because the more
embarrassing and annoying


51
0:1:51,55 --> 0:1:57,228
stuff is what makes the
videos so watchable.


52
0:1:57,228 --> 0:1:58,5
FEMALE SPEAKER: So this
is your bag of


53
0:1:58,5 --> 0:1:59,43
Twilight goodies, right?


54
0:1:59,43 --> 0:2:0,84
EMMA CLARK: Yes, for
the time being.


55
0:2:0,84 --> 0:2:3,95
I've got other stuff, but it's
kind of in safe hiding.


56
0:2:3,95 --> 0:2:6,19
This is my necessary stash.


57
0:2:6,19 --> 0:2:7,75
It's just gorgeous.


58
0:2:7,75 --> 0:2:15,9
I've got my original copy, all
my photos with the cast from


59
0:2:15,9 --> 0:2:17,5
years of conventions.


60
0:2:17,5 --> 0:2:19,1
FEMALE SPEAKER: What about
Kristen Stewart?


61
0:2:19,1 --> 0:2:20,74
EMMA CLARK: I met her as well,
but they weren't doing


62
0:2:20,74 --> 0:2:23,516
pictures, which I'm not that
bothered about now, obviously.


63
0:2:23,516 --> 0:2:27,39
Oh, I don't understand how
she could do this.


64
0:2:27,39 --> 0:2:28,185
Why?


65
0:2:28,185 --> 0:2:29,76
Why would you cheat on
Robert Pattinson?


66
0:2:29,76 --> 0:2:30,85
What's the point of that?


67
0:2:30,85 --> 0:2:32,35
What do you stand to achieve by


68
0:2:32,35 --> 0:2:33,2
cheating on Robert Pattinson?


69
0:2:33,2 --> 0:2:35,11
FEMALE SPEAKER: Where were you
when you heard the news or


70
0:2:35,11 --> 0:2:36,11
whatever-- when you
saw the pictures?


71
0:2:36,11 --> 0:2:38,6
EMMA CLARK: When I first found
out, it was about 3 o'clock in


72
0:2:38,6 --> 0:2:39,76
the morning.


73
0:2:39,76 --> 0:2:43,59
How can you say publicly that
you're so sorry, and you love


74
0:2:43,59 --> 0:2:45,4
him, and yet, you did it?


75
0:2:45,4 --> 0:2:46,64
It just doesn't make sense.


76
0:2:46,64 --> 0:2:49,896
The way he looked at her before
it all happened--


77
0:2:49,896 --> 0:2:52,7
it was like there was no
one else in the room.


78
0:2:52,7 --> 0:2:53,29
It was like it was
Edward and Bella.


79
0:2:53,29 --> 0:2:56,22
And I think that's why it's so
shocking to so many people,


80
0:2:56,22 --> 0:2:57,8
including me.


81
0:2:57,8 --> 0:2:58,33
No.


82
0:2:58,33 --> 0:2:59,978



83
0:2:59,978 --> 0:3:0,826
No.


84
0:3:0,826 --> 0:3:2,886
FEMALE SPEAKER: What word
comes to your mind?


85
0:3:2,886 --> 0:3:5,155
EMMA CLARK: Hussy.


86
0:3:5,155 --> 0:3:7,37
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, God.


87
0:3:7,37 --> 0:3:9,65
Are you scared about
Twilight ending?


88
0:3:9,65 --> 0:3:12,16
EMMA CLARK: It's going
to be a bereavement.


89
0:3:12,16 --> 0:3:15,29
I am in love with this book, and
I'm in love with everybody


90
0:3:15,29 --> 0:3:16,8
that made it what it is--


91
0:3:16,8 --> 0:3:19,983
and the movie-- and I just don't
want it to end, because


92
0:3:19,983 --> 0:3:21,79
it means so much to me.


93
0:3:21,79 --> 0:3:24,86
It kind of doesn't
have to end.


94
0:3:24,86 --> 0:3:26,27
I don't want it to.


95
0:3:26,27 --> 0:3:27,5
I want it to keep going.


96
0:3:27,5 --> 0:3:30,3
It's going to be-- oh my
God, what do I do now?


97
0:3:30,3 --> 0:3:31,23
What do I do with my life?


98
0:3:31,23 --> 0:3:32,7
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thanks so
much for having me.


99
0:3:32,7 --> 0:3:33,26
EMMA CLARK: Yeah, thank you.


100
0:3:33,26 --> 0:3:34,31
FEMALE SPEAKER: It was
so nice to meet you.


101
0:3:34,31 --> 0:3:35,31
EMMA CLARK: It was
nice to meet you.


102
0:3:35,31 --> 0:3:35,43
Thanks.


103
0:3:35,43 --> 0:3:36,18
FEMALE SPEAKER: See you
on the internet.


104
0:3:36,18 --> 0:3:37,53
EMMA CLARK: See you soon.
