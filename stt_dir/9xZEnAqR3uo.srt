0:0:4,7 --> 0:0:8,38



3
0:0:8,38 --> 0:0:11,295
PAUL MOYLET: My name is Paul
Moylet, and we are at the New


4
0:0:11,295 --> 0:0:12,39
York Aquarium.


5
0:0:12,39 --> 0:0:15,48
I am an animal care specialist,
and my job is to


6
0:0:15,48 --> 0:0:18,74
maintain the health of all the
animals in our collection.


7
0:0:18,74 --> 0:0:21,14
We work with a variety
of species.


8
0:0:21,14 --> 0:0:23,85
Mostly marine mammals,
but we also work with


9
0:0:23,85 --> 0:0:24,9
some birds as well.


10
0:0:24,9 --> 0:0:27,45
FEMALE SPEAKER: How often are
baby walruses born here?


11
0:0:27,45 --> 0:0:29,19
PAUL MOYLET: Right now, there's
only about 20 walruses


12
0:0:29,19 --> 0:0:31,9
that exist in aquariums
in the United States.


13
0:0:31,9 --> 0:0:36,43
There's only been 15 births
in the United States


14
0:0:36,43 --> 0:0:38,76
in the past 31 years.


15
0:0:38,76 --> 0:0:43,5
And out of those 15 walruses,
only six have survived--


16
0:0:43,5 --> 0:0:44,26
this guy's number six.


17
0:0:44,26 --> 0:0:45,72
FEMALE SPEAKER: Tell
me about his name.


18
0:0:45,72 --> 0:0:49,38
PAUL MOYLET: His entire name
is Akitusaaq, which means


19
0:0:49,38 --> 0:0:52,17
"gift given in return" in the
Yupik language, which the


20
0:0:52,17 --> 0:0:53,54
Inuit people speak.


21
0:0:53,54 --> 0:0:55,58
But we decided to shorten
it a little bit,


22
0:0:55,58 --> 0:0:57,14
kind of for our benefit.


23
0:0:57,14 --> 0:0:59,42
So now we call him Tusaaq
instead of Aki.


24
0:0:59,42 --> 0:1:0,74
FEMALE SPEAKER: How much did
he weigh when he was born?


25
0:1:0,74 --> 0:1:3,43
PAUL MOYLET: We guesstimated
that he weighed around 115 to


26
0:1:3,43 --> 0:1:5,41
120 pounds, which is just about


27
0:1:5,41 --> 0:1:7,25
average for a baby walrus.


28
0:1:7,25 --> 0:1:9,75
It's a little over eight months
later, and we just


29
0:1:9,75 --> 0:1:10,46
weighed him this morning.


30
0:1:10,46 --> 0:1:12,59
He weighed in at 364 pounds.


31
0:1:12,59 --> 0:1:14,1
So he's quite large.


32
0:1:14,1 --> 0:1:16,45
In fact, he's a lot larger
than his father


33
0:1:16,45 --> 0:1:17,67
was at the same age.


34
0:1:17,67 --> 0:1:20,45
An average weight for an adult
male Pacific walrus is around


35
0:1:20,45 --> 0:1:21,63
3,300 to 3,500 pounds.


36
0:1:21,63 --> 0:1:22,88
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wow.


37
0:1:22,88 --> 0:1:48,39



38
0:1:48,39 --> 0:1:49,91
What about the temperature
of the water?


39
0:1:49,91 --> 0:1:50,855
Is it super cold?


40
0:1:50,855 --> 0:1:52,65
PAUL MOYLET: The temperature
of the water has to be


41
0:1:52,65 --> 0:1:54,49
maintained in a very
cold temperature.


42
0:1:54,49 --> 0:1:57,84
These guys are Arctic animals,
and so they really


43
0:1:57,84 --> 0:1:59,32
need it to be cold.


44
0:1:59,32 --> 0:2:1,85
And it gets down to about--
the coldest


45
0:2:1,85 --> 0:2:3,0
I've seen is 42 degrees.


46
0:2:3,0 --> 0:2:4,245
FEMALE SPEAKER: Did they
like it when it was


47
0:2:4,245 --> 0:2:5,35
snowing last week?


48
0:2:5,35 --> 0:2:6,13
PAUL MOYLET: They
love the snow.


49
0:2:6,13 --> 0:2:7,295
They actually make
snow angels.


50
0:2:7,295 --> 0:2:9,983
What they like to do is crawl up
onto snow and just kind of


51
0:2:9,983 --> 0:2:13,915
roll around, make these big
walrus-sized snow angels.


52
0:2:13,915 --> 0:2:15,972
FEMALE SPEAKER: So tell
me a day in the


53
0:2:15,972 --> 0:2:16,95
life of a baby walrus.


54
0:2:16,95 --> 0:2:20,68
PAUL MOYLET: Well, the baby
walrus that we have, at least,


55
0:2:20,68 --> 0:2:24,477
is very independent and very
curious, and he's always into


56
0:2:24,477 --> 0:2:25,355
everything.


57
0:2:25,355 --> 0:2:27,92
They use suction to eat, so
they suck on anything that


58
0:2:27,92 --> 0:2:28,77
they can fit in their mouths.


59
0:2:28,77 --> 0:2:30,12
And they're like hey,
can I eat this?


60
0:2:30,12 --> 0:2:32,1
And they suck on it, what
does this tastes like?


61
0:2:32,1 --> 0:2:34,31
Oh, it tastes good, it
doesn't taste good.


62
0:2:34,31 --> 0:2:36,72
So that's how he pretty
much spends his day.


63
0:2:36,72 --> 0:2:40,63



64
0:2:40,63 --> 0:2:42,47
Marine mammals for
the most part are


65
0:2:42,47 --> 0:2:43,495
very intelligent animals.


66
0:2:43,495 --> 0:2:47,6
And we do train our walruses to
do a number of what we call


67
0:2:47,6 --> 0:2:48,9
show behaviors.


68
0:2:48,9 --> 0:2:49,66
It's just kind of fun
for the public.


69
0:2:49,66 --> 0:2:52,775
They wave and they salute, they
do a lot of vocalizations


70
0:2:52,775 --> 0:2:54,25
on command.


71
0:2:54,25 --> 0:3:0,194



72
0:3:0,194 --> 0:3:3,182
[WALRUS VOCALIZING]


73
0:3:3,182 --> 0:3:5,14
FEMALE SPEAKER: Can
you hug a walrus?


74
0:3:5,14 --> 0:3:7,25
PAUL MOYLET: You could
definitely hug a walrus if the


75
0:3:7,25 --> 0:3:8,47
walrus wants to be hugged.


76
0:3:8,47 --> 0:3:10,29
You've got to keep in mind these
guys are wild animals.


77
0:3:10,29 --> 0:3:13,59
And sometimes they like a good
scratch, and they'll actually


78
0:3:13,59 --> 0:3:15,84
fall asleep if you rub
them the right way.


79
0:3:15,84 --> 0:3:18,36
But other times they choose not
to be touched, and we just


80
0:3:18,36 --> 0:3:19,18
have to respect them.


81
0:3:19,18 --> 0:3:20,605
FEMALE SPEAKER: Have you
ever hugged one?


82
0:3:20,605 --> 0:3:22,3
PAUL MOYLET: I hug them
all the time.


83
0:3:22,3 --> 0:3:24,5
FEMALE SPEAKER: Are walruses
your favorite?


84
0:3:24,5 --> 0:3:25,95
PAUL MOYLET: I have to admit
that walruses are


85
0:3:25,95 --> 0:3:27,2
my favorite, yes.


86
0:3:27,2 --> 0:5:27,2
