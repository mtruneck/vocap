0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,95



2
0:0:0,95 --> 0:0:2,85
STEVE SPANGLER: Mmm.


3
0:0:2,85 --> 0:0:4,74
Cookies and milk--


4
0:0:4,74 --> 0:0:8,99
that's a pretty good
combination.


5
0:0:8,99 --> 0:0:11,49
There's a lot of science
in cookies.


6
0:0:11,49 --> 0:0:13,89
There's a lot of science in this
chipotle sauce, probably.


7
0:0:13,89 --> 0:0:15,67
But that we're not
talking about.


8
0:0:15,67 --> 0:0:18,8
We're talking about the
science of milk today.


9
0:0:18,8 --> 0:0:19,83
And there's some really, really
cool, believe it or


10
0:0:19,83 --> 0:0:22,2
not, colorful science of milk.


11
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:24,59
Watch this.


12
0:0:24,59 --> 0:0:27,59
I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all
about making science fun.


13
0:0:27,59 --> 0:0:30,68
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


14
0:0:30,68 --> 0:0:33,69
ordinary science experiments
into unforgetable learning


15
0:0:33,69 --> 0:0:34,7
experiences.


16
0:0:34,7 --> 0:0:37,34
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


17
0:0:37,34 --> 0:0:40,8
affect the way people
think about science.


18
0:0:40,8 --> 0:0:42,23
And to do that, I live
by one motto--


19
0:0:42,23 --> 0:0:45,571
make it big, do it right,
give it class.


20
0:0:45,571 --> 0:0:50,72



21
0:0:50,72 --> 0:0:51,97
Watch this.


22
0:0:51,97 --> 0:0:54,12



23
0:0:54,12 --> 0:0:57,0
See this amazing burst
of color that's here?


24
0:0:57,0 --> 0:1:0,86
In order to understand how milk
does this, you have to


25
0:1:0,86 --> 0:1:3,86
understand something about
the chemistry of fat, the


26
0:1:3,86 --> 0:1:7,19
chemistry of water, polar,
nonpolar, hydrophilic,


27
0:1:7,19 --> 0:1:8,41
hydrophobic--


28
0:1:8,41 --> 0:1:10,53
most importantly, the chemistry
of this amazing


29
0:1:10,53 --> 0:1:12,48
substance called soap.


30
0:1:12,48 --> 0:1:14,69
Well, if you take a look at
the science of milk, it's


31
0:1:14,69 --> 0:1:17,11
really a combination of
fat and water, right?


32
0:1:17,11 --> 0:1:19,69
And all different kinds
of fat-- so that's


33
0:1:19,69 --> 0:1:21,295
fat free or 1% 2%.


34
0:1:21,295 --> 0:1:23,74
If we're going to understand
how this burst took place,


35
0:1:23,74 --> 0:1:25,86
let's just break this component
down and start with


36
0:1:25,86 --> 0:1:27,54
the water component itself.


37
0:1:27,54 --> 0:1:31,18
So in a plate goes just
a little bit of water.


38
0:1:31,18 --> 0:1:33,98
And to the water, we add just
a couple drops of food


39
0:1:33,98 --> 0:1:36,35
coloring so that we can
see the movement--


40
0:1:36,35 --> 0:1:39,26
so a couple drops around
the circle.


41
0:1:39,26 --> 0:1:41,95
And now, the last step is just
a little bit of soap.


42
0:1:41,95 --> 0:1:43,83
We're just using regular
dish soap here.


43
0:1:43,83 --> 0:1:46,75
And I don't need a tremendous
amount so I have a little


44
0:1:46,75 --> 0:1:47,3
portion cup.


45
0:1:47,3 --> 0:1:48,73
And our soap is perfect.


46
0:1:48,73 --> 0:1:51,68
Now, in order to dispense it,
I'm just using a cotton swab.


47
0:1:51,68 --> 0:1:56,25
So a little bit of the soap on
the cotton swab, and now,


48
0:1:56,25 --> 0:1:57,35
watch what happens.


49
0:1:57,35 --> 0:1:58,85
You have to look here
in the very middle.


50
0:1:58,85 --> 0:2:0,42
Watch.


51
0:2:0,42 --> 0:2:2,906
Did you see little burst of
color that was there?


52
0:2:2,906 --> 0:2:3,78
That's it.


53
0:2:3,78 --> 0:2:5,46
That's our burst.


54
0:2:5,46 --> 0:2:8,24
It's very different from the
milk that we had before.


55
0:2:8,24 --> 0:2:10,84
See, the milk had this churning
kind of action.


56
0:2:10,84 --> 0:2:14,23
This does actually nothing
except for that initial burst,


57
0:2:14,23 --> 0:2:17,37
which means that the soap helped
to break up the surface


58
0:2:17,37 --> 0:2:20,39
tension of the water-- that
layer of the water that the


59
0:2:20,39 --> 0:2:21,76
molecules hook together.


60
0:2:21,76 --> 0:2:25,0
So the hydrogen bonding allows
the water to form almost a


61
0:2:25,0 --> 0:2:26,57
skin, so to speak.


62
0:2:26,57 --> 0:2:29,5
And the soap, of course, breaks
that skin and breaks


63
0:2:29,5 --> 0:2:30,62
the surface tension.


64
0:2:30,62 --> 0:2:32,4
But we don't get the bursting.


65
0:2:32,4 --> 0:2:37,3
So it really is not a phenomenon
of soap and just


66
0:2:37,3 --> 0:2:39,18
water here and food coloring.


67
0:2:39,18 --> 0:2:41,36
There has to be something
with the fat.


68
0:2:41,36 --> 0:2:44,0
See, milk is really a
combination of polar and


69
0:2:44,0 --> 0:2:45,8
nonpolar materials.


70
0:2:45,8 --> 0:2:46,18
Polar would be water.


71
0:2:46,18 --> 0:2:47,92
Nonpolar would be the fat.


72
0:2:47,92 --> 0:2:51,645
Now, they say that there's
fat, also called lipids.


73
0:2:51,645 --> 0:2:54,82
Maybe The best way to explain
what nonpolar would be is to


74
0:2:54,82 --> 0:2:58,216
use this model of these
little yellow sticks.


75
0:2:58,216 --> 0:2:59,56
They're called lipids.


76
0:2:59,56 --> 0:3:2,69
See, they're nonpolar in that
they're just these long chains


77
0:3:2,69 --> 0:3:4,32
of molecules, so to speak.


78
0:3:4,32 --> 0:3:7,66
See, fat is nothing more than
a combination of hydrogen


79
0:3:7,66 --> 0:3:9,17
molecules hooked onto carbon.


80
0:3:9,17 --> 0:3:11,71
And this long chain
makes the fat.


81
0:3:11,71 --> 0:3:13,88
See, there's no head and
there's no tail.


82
0:3:13,88 --> 0:3:15,57
It's just this long chain.


83
0:3:15,57 --> 0:3:19,44
And this is what we're going to
use to represent the fat.


84
0:3:19,44 --> 0:3:21,31
Soap, on the other hand,
is a combination


85
0:3:21,31 --> 0:3:22,83
of polar and nonpolar.


86
0:3:22,83 --> 0:3:24,92
And that's why we're using
these matches to


87
0:3:24,92 --> 0:3:26,54
represent the soap.


88
0:3:26,54 --> 0:3:27,44
Look at this.


89
0:3:27,44 --> 0:3:30,25
The base of the match here, or
the long part, is going to be


90
0:3:30,25 --> 0:3:34,43
used to represent the nonpolar
part, very similar to this


91
0:3:34,43 --> 0:3:36,53
part that you see over
here with the fat.


92
0:3:36,53 --> 0:3:38,27
But see the very end
of the match?


93
0:3:38,27 --> 0:3:39,4
That's the head.


94
0:3:39,4 --> 0:3:41,23
And let's call that
the polar part.


95
0:3:41,23 --> 0:3:43,47
Now, water is a polar
material.


96
0:3:43,47 --> 0:3:44,71
It's a polar solvent.


97
0:3:44,71 --> 0:3:49,55
So water now dissolves in
the head of the match.


98
0:3:49,55 --> 0:3:52,62
And the rest of that match there
now wants to attach to


99
0:3:52,62 --> 0:3:53,6
something that it's like.


100
0:3:53,6 --> 0:3:56,4
You've heard the thing "like
dissolves like." Well, it


101
0:3:56,4 --> 0:3:58,96
wants to go attach itself
to anything


102
0:3:58,96 --> 0:4:1,44
else that is nonpolar.


103
0:4:1,44 --> 0:4:3,59
Look and see how it attaches
to the fat.


104
0:4:3,59 --> 0:4:6,31
It's a matter of just
matching this up.


105
0:4:6,31 --> 0:4:10,31
The other part, which is the
polar part, the head, now


106
0:4:10,31 --> 0:4:14,1
washes away in the polar
solvent, which is water.


107
0:4:14,1 --> 0:4:16,399
That's a lot of chemistry to
simply say that this is how


108
0:4:16,399 --> 0:4:19,73
you get clean, but this is
exactly how they made soap


109
0:4:19,73 --> 0:4:20,81
many, many, many years ago.


110
0:4:20,81 --> 0:4:24,45
They took white wood ash,
very alkaline, or


111
0:4:24,45 --> 0:4:25,6
they could take lye.


112
0:4:25,6 --> 0:4:27,88
They would combine that with a
little bit of water and then


113
0:4:27,88 --> 0:4:30,66
add and animal fat to that, a
little bit of salt, mix the


114
0:4:30,66 --> 0:4:33,64
whole thing together, and it
made for this perfect material


115
0:4:33,64 --> 0:4:36,73
that would literally cover your
body, remove the grease


116
0:4:36,73 --> 0:4:39,0
and the dirt, and then wash
away in the water.


117
0:4:39,0 --> 0:4:42,7
But some of you need an even
more scientific explanation of


118
0:4:42,7 --> 0:4:44,66
this hydrophobic, hydrophilic,
polar, nonpolar.


119
0:4:44,66 --> 0:4:48,23
And for that, we turn to our
friends at Crash Course!, who


120
0:4:48,23 --> 0:4:49,84
know exactly what to say.


121
0:4:49,84 --> 0:4:51,57
HANK GREEN: The fact that water
is a polar molecule also


122
0:4:51,57 --> 0:4:53,68
makes it really good at
dissolving things, which we


123
0:4:53,68 --> 0:4:55,25
call-- it's a good
solvent, then.


124
0:4:55,25 --> 0:4:55,73
Scratch that.


125
0:4:55,73 --> 0:4:57,12
Water isn't a good solvent.


126
0:4:57,12 --> 0:4:58,65
It's an amazing solvent.


127
0:4:58,65 --> 0:5:1,67
There are more substances that
can be dissolved in water than


128
0:5:1,67 --> 0:5:2,97
in any other liquid on Earth.


129
0:5:2,97 --> 0:5:5,64
And yes, that includes the
strongest acid that we have


130
0:5:5,64 --> 0:5:6,19
ever created.


131
0:5:6,19 --> 0:5:8,19
These substances that
dissolve in water--


132
0:5:8,19 --> 0:5:11,8
sugar or salt being ones that
we're familiar with-- are


133
0:5:11,8 --> 0:5:13,13
called hydrophilic.


134
0:5:13,13 --> 0:5:15,65
And they are hydrophilic
because they are polar.


135
0:5:15,65 --> 0:5:18,24
And their polarity is stronger
than the cohesive


136
0:5:18,24 --> 0:5:19,22
forces of the water.


137
0:5:19,22 --> 0:5:21,23
So when you get one of these
polar substances in water,


138
0:5:21,23 --> 0:5:24,21
it's strong enough that it
breaks all the little cohesive


139
0:5:24,21 --> 0:5:26,18
forces, all those little
hydrogen bonds.


140
0:5:26,18 --> 0:5:28,59
And instead of hydrogen bonding
to each other, the


141
0:5:28,59 --> 0:5:31,85
water will hydrogen bond around
these polar substances.


142
0:5:31,85 --> 0:5:33,42
Table salt is ionic.


143
0:5:33,42 --> 0:5:36,21
And right now, it's being
separated into ions as the


144
0:5:36,21 --> 0:5:38,72
poles of our water molecules
interact with it.


145
0:5:38,72 --> 0:5:42,68
But what happens when there is
a molecule that cannot break


146
0:5:42,68 --> 0:5:44,84
the cohesive forces of water?


147
0:5:44,84 --> 0:5:48,19
It can't penetrate
and come into it.


148
0:5:48,19 --> 0:5:50,64
Basically, what happens when
that substance can't overcome


149
0:5:50,64 --> 0:5:53,88
the strong cohesive forces of
water-- it can't get inside of


150
0:5:53,88 --> 0:5:57,19
the water-- that's when we get
what we call a hydrophobic


151
0:5:57,19 --> 0:6:0,375
substance, or something that
is fearful of water.


152
0:6:0,375 --> 0:6:2,14
These molecules lack
charged poles.


153
0:6:2,14 --> 0:6:5,34
They are nonpolar and are not
dissolving in water, because


154
0:6:5,34 --> 0:6:7,88
essentially, they're being
pushed out of the water by


155
0:6:7,88 --> 0:6:9,34
water's cohesive forces.


156
0:6:9,34 --> 0:6:9,89
Water--


157
0:6:9,89 --> 0:6:12,5
we may call it the universal
solvent, but that does not


158
0:6:12,5 --> 0:6:13,4
mean that it dissolves
everything.


159
0:6:13,4 --> 0:6:15,79
STEVE SPANGLER: So you get this
hydrophobic, hydrophilic


160
0:6:15,79 --> 0:6:16,87
thing, right?


161
0:6:16,87 --> 0:6:20,66
Fat being hydrophobic, correct,
and the hydrophobic


162
0:6:20,66 --> 0:6:23,34
end of the soap, and then the
head of the match being


163
0:6:23,34 --> 0:6:25,44
hydrophilic, or water-loving--


164
0:6:25,44 --> 0:6:28,5
that's the part that just
simply washes away.


165
0:6:28,5 --> 0:6:30,51
What does all this have to
do with bursting milk?


166
0:6:30,51 --> 0:6:33,37
Well, now you start to see the
alignment of the molecules


167
0:6:33,37 --> 0:6:34,8
that take place in milk.


168
0:6:34,8 --> 0:6:36,1
Well, we're back to the milk.


169
0:6:36,1 --> 0:6:39,36
I selected milk for this example
that has a lot of fat.


170
0:6:39,36 --> 0:6:41,55
It's whole milk--


171
0:6:41,55 --> 0:6:42,65
lots of fat.


172
0:6:42,65 --> 0:6:43,73
Of course, there's water.


173
0:6:43,73 --> 0:6:46,23
So if you can imagine this on
a microscopic level, as soon


174
0:6:46,23 --> 0:6:49,31
as I tough it, you now have the
hydrophobic end-- that's


175
0:6:49,31 --> 0:6:51,4
the long end of the soap--


176
0:6:51,4 --> 0:6:53,87
now trying to hook on to the
hydrophobic end of the milk.


177
0:6:53,87 --> 0:6:56,15
And this moving around
these tails--


178
0:6:56,15 --> 0:6:58,59
kind of whipping around-- is
exactly what you see as the


179
0:6:58,59 --> 0:6:59,44
milk starts to move.


180
0:6:59,44 --> 0:7:1,69
Watch.


181
0:7:1,69 --> 0:7:3,24
See, it's the hydrophobic end.


182
0:7:3,24 --> 0:7:6,84
It's the hydrophobic end of the
soap now hooking onto the


183
0:7:6,84 --> 0:7:9,8
hydrophobic end of the milk.


184
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:11,2
And you can see the movement
that's in there.


185
0:7:11,2 --> 0:7:14,64
Literally, we're seeing
molecules in motion as the


186
0:7:14,64 --> 0:7:17,83
milk starts to move around,
and of course, realigning


187
0:7:17,83 --> 0:7:20,7
itself so that the hydrophilic,
or the


188
0:7:20,7 --> 0:7:23,4
water-loving end is close
to that of the


189
0:7:23,4 --> 0:7:24,82
water as it moves around.


190
0:7:24,82 --> 0:7:28,21
And you now get to see this
beautiful movement inside just


191
0:7:28,21 --> 0:7:31,51
because the molecules are
chasing themselves around and


192
0:7:31,51 --> 0:7:32,9
realigning.


193
0:7:32,9 --> 0:7:34,47
So we're going to turn this
into a real science


194
0:7:34,47 --> 0:7:34,855
experiment.


195
0:7:34,855 --> 0:7:36,59
It means we have to
compare something.


196
0:7:36,59 --> 0:7:38,63
And why not compare the
different kinds of milk?


197
0:7:38,63 --> 0:7:43,86
So look over here-- fat free
milk, 1%, 2%, whole milk, half


198
0:7:43,86 --> 0:7:46,87
and half, and finally,
buttermilk.


199
0:7:46,87 --> 0:7:49,0
Now, it's really important as
you're doing your comparison


200
0:7:49,0 --> 0:7:51,58
to make sure that all of the
milk is the same temperature.


201
0:7:51,58 --> 0:7:55,2
So we've let all of this sit
out at room temperature so


202
0:7:55,2 --> 0:7:56,23
that we're comparing this.


203
0:7:56,23 --> 0:7:58,93
The real question would be does
it change at all if you


204
0:7:58,93 --> 0:8:1,29
heat it up or if you
get it colder?


205
0:8:1,29 --> 0:8:2,6
Different question at
a different time.


206
0:8:2,6 --> 0:8:5,65
Right now, we're simply
observing the differences in


207
0:8:5,65 --> 0:8:7,97
fat for all of the milk.


208
0:8:7,97 --> 0:8:10,15
And finally, every great science
experiment has to have


209
0:8:10,15 --> 0:8:11,25
a great hypothesis.


210
0:8:11,25 --> 0:8:13,73
So our hypothesis today
has to be which one


211
0:8:13,73 --> 0:8:14,8
will burst the best?


212
0:8:14,8 --> 0:8:17,77
The one with the most fat or
the one with the least fat?


213
0:8:17,77 --> 0:8:19,78
Lock it in and watch this.


214
0:8:19,78 --> 0:8:21,15
Let's start with fat free.


215
0:8:21,15 --> 0:8:22,4
Watch.


216
0:8:22,4 --> 0:8:28,22



217
0:8:28,22 --> 0:8:29,47
1%.


218
0:8:29,47 --> 0:8:31,58



219
0:8:31,58 --> 0:8:33,48
Wow, we get a great
burst on 1%.


220
0:8:33,48 --> 0:8:36,48



221
0:8:36,48 --> 0:8:38,3
All right, 2%.


222
0:8:38,3 --> 0:8:40,492
Here we go.


223
0:8:40,492 --> 0:8:43,4
Wow, even better.


224
0:8:43,4 --> 0:8:44,65
Here's whole milk.


225
0:8:44,65 --> 0:8:49,499



226
0:8:49,499 --> 0:8:50,94
Beautiful.


227
0:8:50,94 --> 0:8:52,4
Table cream--


228
0:8:52,4 --> 0:8:53,52
lots of fat in table cream.


229
0:8:53,52 --> 0:8:54,77
Watch.


230
0:8:54,77 --> 0:8:57,91



231
0:8:57,91 --> 0:9:1,86
Look at this continued
churning.


232
0:9:1,86 --> 0:9:3,5
And finally, who doesn't like
a little buttermilk?


233
0:9:3,5 --> 0:9:6,68
You know, it leaves that kind
of feeling in your throat.


234
0:9:6,68 --> 0:9:8,31
I know some of you have
already tuned out.


235
0:9:8,31 --> 0:9:9,56
Watch.


236
0:9:9,56 --> 0:9:12,22



237
0:9:12,22 --> 0:9:13,626
Nothing.


238
0:9:13,626 --> 0:9:16,32
Well, outside the buttermilk,
which was just too viscous to


239
0:9:16,32 --> 0:9:19,17
move around, the one with the
most amount of fat is the one


240
0:9:19,17 --> 0:9:21,35
that gives us the best bursting,
although, if you


241
0:9:21,35 --> 0:9:23,62
take a look at each one of
these, you do see some


242
0:9:23,62 --> 0:9:27,34
movement, but it decreases as
you go from whole milk, 2%,


243
0:9:27,34 --> 0:9:30,4
1%, and just very, very little
movement at all with


244
0:9:30,4 --> 0:9:31,71
the fat free milk.


245
0:9:31,71 --> 0:9:34,22
What a cool way to understand
the science of polar and


246
0:9:34,22 --> 0:9:37,3
nonpolar, hydrophilic,
hydrophobic, and the science


247
0:9:37,3 --> 0:9:39,88
of soap using something
simple like milk.


248
0:9:39,88 --> 0:9:43,47
Well, it looks like milk,
but it's not.


249
0:9:43,47 --> 0:9:44,94
It's Elmer's Glue.


250
0:9:44,94 --> 0:9:46,57
See, Elmer's Glue, chemically
speaking,


251
0:9:46,57 --> 0:9:48,13
is polyvinyl acetate.


252
0:9:48,13 --> 0:9:50,5
It's a thermoplastic polymer.


253
0:9:50,5 --> 0:9:53,75
It is unusual because it
has a polar part that


254
0:9:53,75 --> 0:9:54,88
dissolves in water.


255
0:9:54,88 --> 0:9:57,45
But it also has a nonpolar
component.


256
0:9:57,45 --> 0:9:59,45
And you know what we can do if
we have something that has a


257
0:9:59,45 --> 0:10:2,37
polar and nonpolar component.


258
0:10:2,37 --> 0:10:3,73
Get the food coloring.


259
0:10:3,73 --> 0:10:4,8
All right.


260
0:10:4,8 --> 0:10:6,61
This one here-- let's start with
a little bit of Elmer's


261
0:10:6,61 --> 0:10:10,51
Glue and even less water.


262
0:10:10,51 --> 0:10:13,81



263
0:10:13,81 --> 0:10:15,86
Now, if I was doing this for
science project, I would


264
0:10:15,86 --> 0:10:20,26
measure this out so I could call
it a 90% solution of glue


265
0:10:20,26 --> 0:10:22,4
or an 80%, whatever it is.


266
0:10:22,4 --> 0:10:24,87
Here, I just want to test the
hypothesis that if we add some


267
0:10:24,87 --> 0:10:29,43
water, that it's going to give
us some pretty good bursting


268
0:10:29,43 --> 0:10:31,59
of those colors.


269
0:10:31,59 --> 0:10:32,84
Watch what happens.


270
0:10:32,84 --> 0:10:37,41



271
0:10:37,41 --> 0:10:38,76
There's the movement
that we wanted.


272
0:10:38,76 --> 0:10:40,436
Look at this.


273
0:10:40,436 --> 0:10:42,69
It's fantastic.


274
0:10:42,69 --> 0:10:45,2
You almost get this combination
of what we saw


275
0:10:45,2 --> 0:10:45,94
with the buttermilk.


276
0:10:45,94 --> 0:10:47,56
Ah, look at the little
fingers that are kind


277
0:10:47,56 --> 0:10:48,4
of coming out here.


278
0:10:48,4 --> 0:10:52,38
Yet you get more movement than
we saw with just the regular


279
0:10:52,38 --> 0:10:53,57
Elmer's Glue.


280
0:10:53,57 --> 0:10:56,58
Maybe the best part of
this is what happens


281
0:10:56,58 --> 0:10:57,41
when you let it dry.


282
0:10:57,41 --> 0:10:59,32
See, normally, you would
just dump the milk out.


283
0:10:59,32 --> 0:11:1,592
But if you allow the Elmer's
Glue to dry, especially on


284
0:11:1,592 --> 0:11:4,3
these plastic plates, you
get something very cool.


285
0:11:4,3 --> 0:11:5,74
Remember, it's not milk.


286
0:11:5,74 --> 0:11:7,75
All of these plates
have Elmer's Glue.


287
0:11:7,75 --> 0:11:9,41
The only difference is the
amount of water that


288
0:11:9,41 --> 0:11:10,75
we put in each one.


289
0:11:10,75 --> 0:11:13,58
And the best part is, over
time, they'll dry.


290
0:11:13,58 --> 0:11:16,34
Well, if there's not too much
water, they'll dry.


291
0:11:16,34 --> 0:11:17,97
And watch what happens
when they dry.


292
0:11:17,97 --> 0:11:21,925
You can literally just
peel them out.


293
0:11:21,925 --> 0:11:24,34
And it looks like this.


294
0:11:24,34 --> 0:11:26,405
Put them under the flashlight
and take a look at this.


295
0:11:26,405 --> 0:11:29,82
You get this beautiful kind of
stained glass window effect.


296
0:11:29,82 --> 0:11:32,8
Well, you have some fairly
simple materials to learn some


297
0:11:32,8 --> 0:11:33,27
high level chemistry.


298
0:11:33,27 --> 0:11:37,15
And if you use the Elmer's
Glue solution, you get a


299
0:11:37,15 --> 0:11:39,39
keepsake that's pretty
awesome as well.


300
0:11:39,39 --> 0:11:42,85
And best of all, at the end of
day, you've got a whole lot of


301
0:11:42,85 --> 0:11:45,78
milk and some cookies
left over.


302
0:11:45,78 --> 0:11:48,803
Who doesn't like
a little treat?


303
0:11:48,803 --> 0:11:51,569
Oh, god.


304
0:11:51,569 --> 0:11:52,76
That's glue.


305
0:11:52,76 --> 0:11:54,883
Higginsworth!


306
0:11:54,883 --> 0:11:56,61
God, that's horrible.


307
0:11:56,61 --> 0:12:10,88



308
0:12:10,88 --> 0:12:11,68
HIGGINSWORTH: Close the door.


309
0:12:11,68 --> 0:12:12,955
Stop wasting energy.


310
0:12:12,955 --> 0:12:15,8



311
0:12:15,8 --> 0:12:17,5
STEVE SPANGLER: Science
of milk.

0:12:17,5 --> 0:14:17,5
