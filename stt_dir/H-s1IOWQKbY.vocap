###15 BENNY SOLIS: Florence was cool.
###17 I saw some pretty historical stuff and it was really nice.
###20 I actually got to see the world famous statue of that
###23 one guy, and then I saw this big church.
###25 
###28 I never thought I would be good enough in
###30 racing to be here.
###32 Well, I'm not thinking about the race right now.
###34 I'm kind of enjoying what I'm looking at, but yeah, it's
###36 always in the back of my mind.
###39 But I'm just hoping for the best now.

###76 STURLA FAGERHAUG: This is where we're at.
###77 Roggello, Italy.
###79 It's going to be intense.
###82 For the next couple of days, I think it's going to be a big
###84 ass party around here.
###86 That's what it usually is here.
###90 KEVIN SCHWANTZ: This is not an easy place to figure out.
###92 It's difficult.
###94 Lot's of elevation changes.
###96 Lots of different things are going on that'll make the bike
###98 work really good in one corner, and the next corner
###101 it's going to seem like-- because it's downhill-- you're
###103 falling away.
###103 It's an easy place to make a simple mistake, end up running
###107 off the track and tipping over.
###109 Take your time, find some good reference points, have fun.
###113 BENNY SOLIS: I mean, everyone's fast, from first to
###115 the last, they're all just real fast.
###117 I guess everyone's competition here.
###119 
###123 I want to get top 5 this time.
###126 And I know it'll be hard 'cause I don't know the track,
###127 but even if I have to lay a bike down, I want to do what I
###131 have to just to stay in the first 2 rows.
###135 BEN SOLIS: Sometimes I get frustrated, 'cause I don't
###138 know what's going on.
###138 Why is he going that slow?
###140 Because I know he can run up front, but when he's having a
###144 problem, I don't know, what is it?
###148 BENNY SOLIS: Sometimes I'm just not into it.
###149 But he tells me I have to be if I want to be up here doing
###152 what I want.
###154 Jake's over here, and then he's doing it,
###155 he's getting it done.
###158 KEVIN SCHWANTZ: You're at Mugello, MotoGP teams are
###161 here, 100,000 fans sitting on the hillside.
###165 That in itself is enough pressure.
###166 And a lot of times, the parents are adding pressure.
###171 Benny Solis, Jake Gagne, Hayden Gillim, those kids have
###174 their dads here working on the bike.
###176 It's a certain situation where the family's been doing their
###181 best to try and get this kid into a road racing career and
###185 trying to push them along and help them.
###187 It's kind of make it or break it time.
###189 MARC GAGNE: Our whole goal is to stay up, and get points,
###192 and be consistent, and not to throw the bike away.
###195 You can't do anything on the ground, you can't win on the
###198 ground, you can't score points on the ground.
###200 JAKE GAGNE: Having my dad here--
###202 it's good.
###203 He pushes me a little bit harder and he knows how to
###206 work on bikes really good.
###208 I like having my dad here, he's good.
###210 MARC GAGNE: The old days of daddy and going racing are
###213 kind of over.
###214 Now it's just make sure you get me there, Dad, I'll take
###217 it from there.
###218 
###222 HAYDEN GILLIM: It's easier to give feedback to him about
###225 what the bike is doing because we've been racing and working
###230 on bikes together for 8 years, now.
###233 And he's just a really big help 'cause,
###236 well, he's my dad.
###238 FRANKIE GILLIM: Usually he's always been real loose and
###240 doesn't really get stressed, or anything like that.
###243 This year, I don't know if he is or not.
###247 I just try and make him laugh.
###248 
###252 STURLA FAGERHAUG: My dad just, he usually just says good luck
###254 and stuff before the race.
###255 It's not like he's out there saying, you have to finish the
###259 race, you have to win this one, and all that--
###262 think of the championship--
###263 like that stuff.
###264 He just says good luck and do your best.
###266 OISTEIN FAGERHAUG: A lot of parents interfere a lot and
###269 tell them do this, do this, do this--
###271 GURO FAGERHAUG: Yeah, I know that.
###272 OISTEIN FAGERHAUG: --and get angry if they crash, and it's
###274 not like that.
###275 KEVIN SCHWANTZ: Whether it's your father, or whether it's
###277 somebody who's really close to you, they can be your biggest
###279 supporter at times, but they can also be your biggest
###281 critic, especially if the kid has a struggle out there and
###285 maybe has a rough weekend, and then dad's sitting there, arms
###288 crossed, kind of looking at you.
###290 
###295 BENNY SOLIS: I'm nervous.
###297 I'm always nervous.
###299 
###305 DANNY WALKER: One of his talents, and a natural thing
###307 for him is he's about as calm as can be.
###310 I'm nervous as get out, I can't hardly stand still, and
###313 he's over there taking his sweet time, getting dressed.
###316 What, I still got 15 minutes.
###318 Like it's a day or two.

###357 PETER CLIFFORD: The light, red lights go out.
###358 Disaster from Fagerhaug, total disaster from the cup leader.
###363 Well, his practice start wasn't any good to him at all,
###366 because that's made an absolute nonsense of him.
###370 [MOTORCYCLE ENGINES]
###375 BEN SOLIS: Basically letting know Benny his position, what
###379 lap times, and that way he can see what's going on.
###384 [MOTORCYCLE ENGINES]
###387 PETER CLIFFORD: Back to red helmet of Sturla Fagerhaug.
###389 He's now up into 13th, he'll still see that he's got a
###392 chance of getting with the front runners here.
###396 [MOTORCYCLE ENGINES]
###405 PETER CLIFFORD: 5 abreast across the start and finish
###407 line for the rookies, and Fagerhaug is there with the
###410 red helmet.
###410 Pick out #33, Fagerhaug.
###411 It's right there now.
###413 He's on the left hand side.
###415 He's up into third place.
###416 Is he going go for second?
###417 He looks at second.
###418 He doesn't, he backs out of it.
###419 Kornfeil comes around the outside.
###422 [MOTORCYCLE ENGINES]
###423 PETER CLIFFORD: Fagerhaug has the advantage.
###425 Now Kornfeil is traveling behind him, and really work
###428 with the Norwegian, and try and get away from
###430 the rest of the pack.
###432 
###438 PETER CLIFFORD: Jake Gagne, still with that third place,
###440 and if anything he has closed that gap.
###443 He certainly opened up the advantage.
###444 MARC GAGNE: He's staying smooth and he's got fastest
###448 lap right now, so--
###448 -How you feeling?
###449 MARC GAGNE: Nervous as heck, but all right.
###452 It's all good.
###453 It's hard to have as much fun as I'm having right now.
###457 PETER CLIFFORD: There's 2 men down, and I didn't say the
###460 falling so I'm not sure who that is.
###463 It's too focused, and unfortunately Jake Gagne
###466 walking back.
###467 MARC GAGNE: And he went down up there,
###468 and so he was walking.
###469 They show them on the camera.
###471 He was pushing, trying to run up there.
###474 It's difficult to do.
###474 Never been here, so, maybe he pushed a little too hard.
###477 He'll be fine.
###478 It's time to go to the next one.
###480 And now he knows he can run with these guys, so I would
###483 say look out.
###484 PETER CLIFFORD: Weaving across the track to spoil a
###486 slipstream, it's Sturla Fagerhaug, and he's
###489 going to take it.
###490 Yes, Sturla Fagerhaug takes his second victory of the
###493 Rookies Cup season.

###515 GURO FAGERHAUG: Congratulations.
###517 STURLA FAGERHAUG: Thanks.
###518 
###542 JAKE GAGNE: I've had 2 broken wrists, a broken collarbone,
###546 broken toes, broken heel, and then just got
###551 knocked out a few times.
###554 They're all really painful.
###555 Breaking bones never feels good, but you've got
###557 to deal with it.
###558 HAYDEN GILLIM: The crashes that I know I'm
###559 going to hurt myself--
###561 like whenever I broke my collarbone, that crash
###564 whenever I high sided--
###565 the 3 or 4 corners before I crashed, it just felt like I
###570 was dreaming.
###572 And then whenever I crashed, it didn't even feel like I was
###576 the one crashing.
###577 MARC GAGNE: I love seeing a good crash.
###579 I mean-- not necessarily motorcycles--
###581 cars, anything.
###582 As long as they walk away.
###583 Nobody likes to see anybody get hurt.
###585 But, sure.
###587 Crashing is part of the aura of racing, and when crashes
###592 occur, it's usually because somebody's pushing the limit,
###594 and you're going just a little bit over the edge.
###598 And usually that's very, very fast.
###600 JAKE GAGNE: If you race motorcycles you've got to
###602 expect you're going to crash sooner or later.
###604 You've just got to accept it, try not to think about it.
###607 Sometimes it can be bad, sometimes you can walk away
###610 and not even feel anything.
###612 Just depends how it is.
###613 But you just got to learn to accept it.
###616 KEVIN SCHWANTZ: I think the certain amount of danger, some
###619 guys are willing to take that risk a little bit more than
###621 the other, and that's those guys that can push the
###625 envelope, recover from it, and still go back there time and
###628 time again.
###629 
###632 JEREMY APPLETON: While motorcycle racing is still a
###634 dangerous activity there are less broken limbs compared
###639 with what their used to be, partly because we've built
###643 technology into the suits and the equipment which aims to
###648 keep riders sliding during the course of an accident, so
###652 dissipating energy during the course of an accident.
###655 There are certain accidents where, inevitably, limbs or
###659 bones get broken because of the sheer forces involved.
###662 But generally speaking, riders these days are less prone to
###668 the sort of injuries they occur through violent,
###672 uncontrolled crashes.
###673 PETER CLIFFORD: A decade or 2 ago, the sport was a lot more
###677 individual then, and a lot more dangerous.
###680 Now it's more of a team sport.
###682 The team that you ride for and the people around you matter
###685 more, and it's a lot less dangerous than it used to be.
###688 You've got to be unlucky to get very seriously hurt now,
###692 and terribly unlucky to get killed.
###694 MARC GAGNE: You've got people out there that are doing
###697 something that 1 millionth of the population
###700 could possibly do.
###701 Me being on the edge of my seat, my heart racing--
###704 I mean, I can't go do it anymore.
###706 But I can definitely get that feeling by watching it,
###709 especially when you know somebody or, in my case, I'm
###712 lucky enough to have my son that does it.
