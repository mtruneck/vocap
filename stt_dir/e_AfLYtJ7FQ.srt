1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,904



2
0:0:2,904 --> 0:0:3,388
SPIKE JONZE: OK?


3
0:0:3,388 --> 0:0:4,84
MAURICE SENDAK: Yup.


4
0:0:4,84 --> 0:0:5,808
Do I--


5
0:0:5,808 --> 0:0:7,26
SPIKE JONZE: Yeah, just say,
I'm Maurice Sendak.


6
0:0:7,26 --> 0:0:8,95
We're out at my barn.


7
0:0:8,95 --> 0:0:10,11
MAURICE SENDAK: Oh, OK.


8
0:0:10,11 --> 0:0:11,14
I'm Maurice Sendak.


9
0:0:11,14 --> 0:0:15,3
We are now sitting in my barn.


10
0:0:15,3 --> 0:0:16,49
It's where I come and
work when I want


11
0:0:16,49 --> 0:0:18,26
it to be very quiet.


12
0:0:18,26 --> 0:0:21,25
There's no radio here, there's
no TV, there's nothing here.


13
0:0:21,25 --> 0:0:27,7
Just me and Herman, the German
Shepherd, who says nothing.


14
0:0:27,7 --> 0:0:30,89
He doesn't critique my work,
doesn't cluck his tongue.


15
0:0:30,89 --> 0:0:35,15
When he has to take a leak, he
just tells you, straight out.


16
0:0:35,15 --> 0:0:37,65
Well, I've had infinite
amount of dogs, but


17
0:0:37,65 --> 0:0:38,91
Herman is the best.


18
0:0:38,91 --> 0:0:40,6
And also he's the
best trained.


19
0:0:40,6 --> 0:0:42,925
Because of my legs and back,
he walks slowly,


20
0:0:42,925 --> 0:0:45,54
he looks after me.


21
0:0:45,54 --> 0:0:49,52
Aside from her, he's the only
thing that makes me happy.


22
0:0:49,52 --> 0:0:50,74
SPIKE JONZE: Aside from Lynn?


23
0:0:50,74 --> 0:0:52,33
Does Lynn live with you?


24
0:0:52,33 --> 0:0:52,91
MAURICE SENDAK: Yes.


25
0:0:52,91 --> 0:0:55,172
She's the woman in my life.


26
0:0:55,172 --> 0:0:57,32
She is the only woman
in my life.


27
0:0:57,32 --> 0:0:58,214
LYNN CAPONERA: That's
not true.


28
0:0:58,214 --> 0:1:0,45
You have a lot of women
in your life.


29
0:1:0,45 --> 0:1:0,97
MAURICE SENDAK: Yes.


30
0:1:0,97 --> 0:1:3,16
LYNN CAPONERA: Women
love Maurice.


31
0:1:3,16 --> 0:1:5,755
Maurice gets proposed
to at least four or


32
0:1:5,755 --> 0:1:6,61
five times a year.


33
0:1:6,61 --> 0:1:8,2
MAURICE SENDAK: It's
terrifying.


34
0:1:8,2 --> 0:1:9,99
SPIKE JONZE: Keener
proposed to you.


35
0:1:9,99 --> 0:1:10,39
MAURICE SENDAK: Who?


36
0:1:10,39 --> 0:1:12,64
SPIKE JONZE: Catherine Keener
wanted to marry you.


37
0:1:12,64 --> 0:1:15,5
MAURICE SENDAK: I want to marry
her, too, but it's not


38
0:1:15,5 --> 0:1:18,19
likely we'll get it together.


39
0:1:18,19 --> 0:1:19,75
CATHERINE KEENER: Hi, Maurice.


40
0:1:19,75 --> 0:1:21,3
I'm practicing.


41
0:1:21,3 --> 0:1:22,98
Hi, Maurice.


42
0:1:22,98 --> 0:1:24,92
Did you have brothers
or sisters?


43
0:1:24,92 --> 0:1:26,21
MAURICE SENDAK: I had.


44
0:1:26,21 --> 0:1:27,135
CATHERINE KEENER:
They're gone?


45
0:1:27,135 --> 0:1:28,25
MAURICE SENDAK: They're gone.


46
0:1:28,25 --> 0:1:32,8
They were wonderful, truly
wonderful people.


47
0:1:32,8 --> 0:1:33,28
CATHERINE KEENER:
Girls or boys?


48
0:1:33,28 --> 0:1:35,201
MAURICE SENDAK: One brother,
one sister.


49
0:1:35,201 --> 0:1:36,451
I'm the baby.


50
0:1:36,451 --> 0:1:38,85



51
0:1:38,85 --> 0:1:40,1
CATHERINE KEENER: You
are the baby.


52
0:1:40,1 --> 0:1:41,85
I could tell.


53
0:1:41,85 --> 0:1:44,732
You seem like the baby
in the line-up.


54
0:1:44,732 --> 0:1:45,158
SPIKE JONZE: How do you tell?


55
0:1:45,158 --> 0:1:46,48
MAURICE SENDAK: How
do you tell?


56
0:1:46,48 --> 0:1:46,95
CATHERINE KEENER:
I don't know.


57
0:1:46,95 --> 0:1:47,87
I just feel it.


58
0:1:47,87 --> 0:1:49,86
SPIKE JONZE: I was telling
Keener how a lot of your


59
0:1:49,86 --> 0:1:53,34
family and experiences with your
family have wound up in a


60
0:1:53,34 --> 0:1:54,35
lot of your work.


61
0:1:54,35 --> 0:1:55,273
Is that true?


62
0:1:55,273 --> 0:1:56,119
MAURICE SENDAK: No.


63
0:1:56,119 --> 0:1:57,39
SPIKE JONZE: No?


64
0:1:57,39 --> 0:1:58,12
You told me that--


65
0:1:58,12 --> 0:2:1,55
MAURICE SENDAK: I make
up a lot of shit.


66
0:2:1,55 --> 0:2:4,36
But I can't tell
the real story.


67
0:2:4,36 --> 0:4:4,36
