HAMILTON MORRIS: Hello.


5
0:0:43,11 --> 0:0:44,67
I'm Hamilton Morris.


6
0:0:44,67 --> 0:0:50,79
We're currently boating through
flooded forests on our


7
0:0:50,79 --> 0:0:55,57
way to meet the Mayoruna
Indians, a formerly


8
0:0:55,57 --> 0:1:1,52
cannibalistic tribe who use
a strange frog derived


9
0:1:1,52 --> 0:1:3,67
drug they call sapo.


10
0:1:3,67 --> 0:1:6,45
They use it to give themselves
energy before hunting.


11
0:1:6,45 --> 0:1:10,52
They use it to abort pregnancies
by rubbing these


12
0:1:10,52 --> 0:1:12,99
womens' vaginas with it.


13
0:1:12,99 --> 0:1:18,46
This venom contains an opioid
peptide that's 100 times


14
0:1:18,46 --> 0:1:20,7
stronger than morphine.


15
0:1:20,7 --> 0:1:22,62
And some people say that
it's psychedelic.


16
0:1:22,62 --> 0:1:25,86
It doesn't activity any of
the psychedelic receptors


17
0:1:25,86 --> 0:1:27,14
are far as I know.


18
0:1:27,14 --> 0:1:29,93
But there's also a lot about
the venom we don't know.


19
0:1:29,93 --> 0:1:32,915



20
0:1:32,915 --> 0:1:36,26
The venom produces some
kind of a strange


21
0:1:36,26 --> 0:1:37,87
effect to make you vomit.


22
0:1:37,87 --> 0:1:41,175
And then supposedly you spending
the next eight hours


23
0:1:41,175 --> 0:1:45,0
in some kind of a daze.


24

the next day.

rub the frog venom
into my wounds.


28

And then it's going to produce
some sort of a strange effect.

it's going to do.

in Tabatinga after


36
0:2:40,28 --> 0:2:41,87
days of traveling.


37
0:2:41,87 --> 0:2:45,36
It's an impossibly humid

between the borders of

40
0:2:48,99 --> 0:2:59,76

0:2:59,76 --> 0:3:2,67
I feel like I'm being gang
banged by vegetation.


42
0:3:2,67 --> 0:3:5,7
Every visible surface is coated
with growing plants.


43
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:7,85
The streets are overrun
with motorcycles,


44
0:3:7,85 --> 0:3:9,59
scooters, and mopeds.


45
0:3:9,59 --> 0:3:13,71
I can feel that the
jungle is near.


46
0:3:13,71 --> 0:3:16,575
I go to the dock where the
journey will begin and meet


47
0:3:16,575 --> 0:3:18,7
our guide, Juan.


48
0:3:18,7 --> 0:3:21,7
Before we exchange a word, he
looked at my long hair and


49
0:3:21,7 --> 0:3:22,85
started laughing hysterically.


50
0:3:22,85 --> 0:3:24,65
He said the Mayoruna
Indians are going


51
0:3:24,65 --> 0:3:26,25
to think I'm a woman.


52
0:3:26,25 --> 0:3:28,46
They're going to kidnap
me as a wife.


53
0:3:28,46 --> 0:3:30,87
Then he repeated the joke a
million times during the

in the middle.

0:3:41,525 --> 0:3:44,355



60
0:3:44,355 --> 0:3:47,49
I meet the other crew member,
a man introduced as the


61
0:3:47,49 --> 0:3:50,38
captain who will run the
boat's small motor.


62
0:3:50,38 --> 0:4:4,92



63
0:4:4,92 --> 0:4:8,6
We make a quick stop to pick
up a giant block of filthy


64
0:4:8,6 --> 0:4:9,325
frozen river water.


65
0:4:9,325 --> 0:4:18,45



66
0:4:18,45 --> 0:4:21,599
The ice block is dragged out of
the freezer through a heap


67
0:4:21,599 --> 0:4:22,895
of bloody gutted catfish.


68
0:4:22,895 --> 0:4:27,37



69
0:4:27,37 --> 0:4:30,55
The captain then proceeds to
smash up the ice blocks with


70
0:4:30,55 --> 0:4:33,66
the rusty machete and throw the
chunks into a couple of


71
0:4:33,66 --> 0:4:35,65
styrofoam coolers which
will hold our


72
0:4:35,65 --> 0:4:37,71

73
0:4:37,71 --> 0:4:40,46
Juan says the ice will last
six days, but that seems

We're still on the border of

with Columbia this way, Brazil
this way, and Peru that way.


79
0:5:3,19 --> 0:5:6,93
Because of it's proximity to
Colombia and Peru, Tabatinga


80
0:5:6,93 --> 0:5:9,44
has become one of the main
entry points for cocaine


81
0:5:9,44 --> 0:5:11,96

encountering cocaine being


83
0:5:14,44 --> 0:5:16,518
shuttled around is
not too low.


84
0:5:16,518 --> 0:5:21,5

Amazon River swells over the

of everything in sight.

urethra of other penis fish.

It's exhausting to watch.

we take a detour

193
0:13:24,8 --> 0:13:28,52
FUNAI, the Brazilian agency
dedicated to indian affairs,


194
0:13:28,52 --> 0:13:31,34
patrols these waters looking
for unlicensed groups like


195
0:13:31,34 --> 0:13:34,56

contact the Indians.

0:13:34,56 --> 0:13:37,29
Juan also tells me the Amazon
is full of creatures


197
0:13:37,29 --> 0:13:39,78
scientists know nothing about.


198
0:13:39,78 --> 0:13:43,4

he encountered a fur covered

a glance.

And as a result, Juan suffered
a five month long fever.

I had been smoking JWH-018-laced

was too high to be skeptical.

So instead, I opted
for extreme fear.
