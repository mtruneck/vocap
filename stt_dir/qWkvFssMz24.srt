Hey Food Tubers!
Welcome to the Dumpling Sisters kitchen. Now


2
0:0:11,77 --> 0:0:16,73
Chinese New Year is just around the corner,
so we're making some delicious pot stickers.


3
0:0:16,73 --> 0:0:19,56
Pan fried dumplings that look like little
nuggets of gold. Legends says that they will


4
0:0:19,56 --> 0:0:25,1
bring good fortune if eaten on New Years Eve.
Our pot stickers have a juicy pork filling


5
0:0:25,1 --> 0:0:28,27
and we whip up a fab dipping sauce to go with
them too!


6
0:0:28,27 --> 0:0:32,15
So let's get started.
First up dumpling wrappers, now these are


7
0:0:32,15 --> 0:0:36,19
so ridiculously easy that you'll never have
to buy them from the shop again.


8
0:0:36,19 --> 0:0:42,59
And with 300 grams of flour, goes a good pinch
of salt and 220mls of boiling water to bring


9
0:0:42,59 --> 0:0:45,5
it all together.
Now this is a neat little trick to stop them


10
0:0:45,5 --> 0:0:48,77
getting too sticky. But do take your time
because the dough is scorching hot!


11
0:0:48,77 --> 0:0:53,27
Try getting your chopsticks in there too,
think of them as useful tools to get you from


12
0:0:53,27 --> 0:0:57,0
kitchen to dinner table.
Now to work on those arm muscles!


13
0:0:57,0 --> 0:1:2,6
knead the dough for about 10 minutes until
silky smooth. Now before we let this baby


14
0:1:2,6 --> 0:1:6,0
rest we're going to hcop it into two and then
form each into a bagel.


15
0:1:6,0 --> 0:1:11,119
This is our little tip to get all the pot
stickers the same size.


16
0:1:11,119 --> 0:1:23,229
Don't try that at home!
Now while the dough's resting we're going


17
0:1:23,229 --> 0:1:27,85
to get started on our filling. So here we
have some lovely pork shoulder. We're going


18
0:1:27,85 --> 0:1:31,119
to mince it up ourselves even though you can
use pork mince. Because that's the way that


19
0:1:31,119 --> 0:1:35,14
Mum taught us and it's always made for a scrumptious
filling.


20
0:1:35,14 --> 0:1:39,659
Give it a good bash up with your cleaver,
300 grams of pork shoulder should make 32


21
0:1:39,659 --> 0:1:41,759
dumplings.
To tenderise the meat we're just going to


22
0:1:41,759 --> 0:1:46,27
chuck in a little bit of baking soda and corn
flour. These two are magic ingredients in


23
0:1:46,27 --> 0:1:50,84
the Chinese kitchen, Baking soda breaks down
the tough proteins in meat while the corn


24
0:1:50,84 --> 0:1:57,6
four creates a velvety mouth feel.
Salt, sugar and a wee bit of white pepper.


25
0:1:57,6 --> 0:2:2,729
To plump everything up we're just going to
chuck in some water, bit of salsing rice wine.


26
0:2:2,729 --> 0:2:13,739
Dark soy, light soy and sesame oil.
Then just grab your chopsticks and give it


27
0:2:13,739 --> 0:2:16,6
a good mix.
And to make our dumplings a complete meal


28
0:2:16,6 --> 0:2:21,87
we're going to chuck in a wee bit of leafy
bok choi as well.


29
0:2:21,87 --> 0:2:27,599
And just to finish it off we're going to chuck
in some garlic and ginger and of course as


30
0:2:27,599 --> 0:2:31,23
always spring onion a staple in the Chinese
Kitchen.


31
0:2:31,23 --> 0:2:34,709
Mix it up in one direction just to make sure
that everything binds together so we get a


32
0:2:34,709 --> 0:2:38,69
lovely bite when we sink our teeth into those
dumplings.


33
0:2:38,69 --> 0:2:44,51
Right, these babies are ready to go!
Through the middle, line the halves up and


34
0:2:44,51 --> 0:2:54,819
keep dividing until you get 16 pieces.
There you have it a little army of identical


35
0:2:54,819 --> 0:3:0,349
dough pieces. Place a piece cut side up, flat
onto your palm and we;ll get on with turning


36
0:3:0,349 --> 0:3:3,8
these into dumpling wrappers.
Now I'm going to use a rolling pin, the skinnier


37
0:3:3,8 --> 0:3:9,5
the better. If you're right handed that#s
where your rolling pin will be, here we go.


38
0:3:9,5 --> 0:3:17,849
Roll, twist with your left hand, roll, twist
with your left hand, roll, twist, roll, twist,


39
0:3:17,849 --> 0:3:26,25
roll twist, roll, twist.
And just keep going!


40
0:3:26,25 --> 0:3:30,409
Time to get our wrap on. SO start by making
a cradle for your hand with the dumping wrapper


41
0:3:30,409 --> 0:3:39,4
then grab some filling and pop it in the middle.
Smooth down the top, then fold it over with


42
0:3:39,4 --> 0:3:44,45
your thumb In the middle. Give it a wee pinch
at the end before guiding it over and folding


43
0:3:44,45 --> 0:3:51,47
it over with your thumb and index finger.
And again, and again, making sure to pinch


44
0:3:51,47 --> 0:3:54,5
as you go along.
All the way until the end.


45
0:3:54,5 --> 0:4:4,939
When you're left with a lovely crescent shape!
Should we do like ghost?


46
0:4:4,939 --> 0:4:12,79
This is good for date night. Perfect for date
night. You mean look longingly into each others


47
0:4:12,79 --> 0:4:13,849
eyes?!
Ha!


48
0:4:13,849 --> 0:4:19,72
Put your thumb in there!
Get a frying pan with a tight fitting lit


49
0:4:19,72 --> 0:4:26,47
over medium heat and a splash of veg oil.
Let's get these bad boys in. Nestle them in


50
0:4:26,47 --> 0:4:35,889
really tight around the pan. Big spoon, little
spoon.


51
0:4:35,889 --> 0:4:41,49
When the bottoms are golden like this, pour
on water and cover.


52
0:4:41,49 --> 0:4:46,27
While the dumplings are cooking we're going
to make out the easiest dipping sauce of all


53
0:4:46,27 --> 0:4:50,27
time.
First, sesame oil, then we've got some light


54
0:4:50,27 --> 0:4:56,9
soy sauce, generous with that one.
And just to finish off, a nice blob of chilli


55
0:4:56,9 --> 0:5:1,21
oil. So chuck that in. I like that quite spicy.
Done.


56
0:5:1,21 --> 0:5:4,3
Ohh yum!
Right, these are done when the water's all


57
0:5:4,3 --> 0:5:6,78
gone. Just remember to put those golden bottoms
on show.


58
0:5:6,78 --> 0:5:11,8
