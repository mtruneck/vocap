CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: It is Friday, which
is awesome. It`s the end of the week, end


2
0:0:4,259 --> 0:0:8,16
of the month and the start of a new day of
CNN STUDENT NEWS. Hello, everyone. My name


3
0:0:8,16 --> 0:0:23,85
is Carl Azuz. Let`s go in and get started.


4
0:0:23,85 --> 0:0:29,24
Permanent observer -- or non-member observer
state -- now they might not sound like much


5
0:0:29,24 --> 0:0:33,85
of a difference between those two terms, but
if you ask some Palestinian officials, the


6
0:0:33,85 --> 0:0:38,67
difference is huge. Yesterday, the United
Nations voted to upgrade the status of the


7
0:0:38,67 --> 0:0:43,339
Palestinian Authority. Palestinian officials
had been pushing for this. They think it will


8
0:0:43,339 --> 0:0:48,55
give them some leverage in negotiating with
Israel, but Israel and the United States have


9
0:0:48,55 --> 0:0:53,129
been against this upgrade, they argue that
it won`t have much of an effect on efforts


10
0:0:53,129 --> 0:0:55,469
to create a Middle East peace deal.


11
0:0:55,469 --> 0:1:1,299
When you hear about drones, unmanned aircraft
you might think about them flying over Afghanistan.


12
0:1:1,299 --> 0:1:5,59
These are remote controlled vehicles, and
they are used a lot by the U.S. military in


13
0:1:5,59 --> 0:1:9,93
the fight against terrorism. But drones could
start popping up in the skies over the United


14
0:1:9,93 --> 0:1:15,24
States. Lisa Sylvester looks at the capabilities
and the concerns that might come along for


15
0:1:15,24 --> 0:1:15,53
the ride.


16
0:1:15,53 --> 0:1:16,39
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


17
0:1:16,39 --> 0:1:20,28
LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right now,
only groups with special FAA permission, like


18
0:1:20,28 --> 0:1:25,5
the U.S. Customs and Border Protection can
operate drones in the United States, but that


19
0:1:25,5 --> 0:1:30,52
is going to change: Congress has asked the
Federal Aviation Administration to find a


20
0:1:30,52 --> 0:1:34,82
safe way to expand the use of drones, or unmanned
aerial systems domestically.


21
0:1:34,82 --> 0:1:41,3
BEN WIITTES, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: The bottom
line is that by 2015, the FAA has to have


22
0:1:41,3 --> 0:1:48,439
a comprehensive plan to open the air space
to both public and private UAS.


23
0:1:48,439 --> 0:1:56,85
SYLVESTER: Think of the potential from crop
dusting to news traffic reports to surveilling


24
0:1:56,85 --> 0:2:2,729
land to monitoring forest fires.


25
0:2:2,729 --> 0:2:7,799
There is a big industry pushing the federal
government to open up the skies arguing these


26
0:2:7,799 --> 0:2:11,23
unmanned air craft systems are safer and less
expensive.


27
0:2:11,23 --> 0:2:17,44
SYLVESTER: Unmanned aerial vehicles or drones
can be as large as a fighter jet or only just


28
0:2:17,44 --> 0:2:22,2
a couple of feet long, and people have actually
been flying unmanned vehicles or even model


29
0:2:22,2 --> 0:2:27,92
airplanes for years, but with certain restrictions.
They can`t fly them above 400 feet, or in


30
0:2:27,92 --> 0:2:32,87
certain areas like airports without running
into problems with FAA.


31
0:2:32,87 --> 0:2:37,76
That brings us to one of the problems the
FAA is trying to solve: how to ensure safety


32
0:2:37,76 --> 0:2:40,45
if the sky suddenly become a lot more crowded.


33
0:2:40,45 --> 0:2:43,15
KEVIN HIATT, FIGHT SAFETY FOUNDATION: Some
of the larger concerns are the construction


34
0:2:43,15 --> 0:2:49,75
of the aircraft. Who`s piloting them? The
actual bandwidth. Also, taking a look at some


35
0:2:49,75 --> 0:2:54,9
of those social issues, which we`ve all started
to look into as far as privacy.


36
0:2:54,9 --> 0:2:58,75
SYLVESTER: It`s the privacy peace that Representative
Edward Markey is most concerned about: could


37
0:2:58,75 --> 0:3:4,19
prying paparazzi hound celebrities? When can
drones be used by law enforcement to gather


38
0:3:4,19 --> 0:3:7,31
evidence? And what about the information gathered
by the drones?


39
0:3:7,31 --> 0:3:10,59
REP. EDWARD MARKEY, (D ), MASSACHUSETTS: Is
it possible that this is just going to be


40
0:3:10,59 --> 0:3:18,17
a rampant, eyes in the sky gathering information
about Americans with no rules, whatsoever.


41
0:3:18,17 --> 0:3:19,46
(END VIDEOTAPE)


42
0:3:19,46 --> 0:3:24,79
AZUZ: During the 2012 U.S. presidential election,
Barack Obama and Mitt Romney only came face


43
0:3:24,79 --> 0:3:31,12
to face four times: they had their three debates
and a fundraising dinner. On election night,


44
0:3:31,12 --> 0:3:33,4
President Obama suggested another get together:


45
0:3:33,4 --> 0:3:33,9
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


46
0:3:33,9 --> 0:3:36,51
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: In the weeks ahead, I also look


47
0:3:36,51 --> 0:3:41,0
forward to sitting down with Governor Romney
to talk about where we can work together to


48
0:3:41,0 --> 0:3:42,93
move this country forward.


49
0:3:42,93 --> 0:3:43,9
AUDIENCE: Yes!


50
0:3:43,9 --> 0:3:44,38
(applause)


51
0:3:44,38 --> 0:3:45,83
(END VIDEO CLIP)


52
0:3:45,83 --> 0:3:49,95
AZUZ: That meeting happened yesterday. The
former opponents got together for lunch at


53
0:3:49,95 --> 0:3:54,69
the White House. Now, we don`t know exactly
what was sad, there were no news media allowed.


54
0:3:54,69 --> 0:3:59,28
But a White House statement said President
Obama and Governor Romney talked about America`s


55
0:3:59,28 --> 0:4:3,32
role in the world. And they promised to stay
in touch with each other.


56
0:4:3,32 --> 0:4:8,53
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: See, if you can I.D. me.


57
0:4:8,53 --> 0:4:15,69
I was born in Germany in 1879. In my early
life, I worked in the Swiss patent office.


58
0:4:15,69 --> 0:4:23,39
But I`m known as a famous physicist. And in
1921 I won the Nobel Prize for physics.


59
0:4:23,39 --> 0:4:30,45
I`m Albert Einstein. And you`ve probably heard
about my theory of relativity.


60
0:4:30,45 --> 0:4:38,4
AZUZ: When a Nobel prize came up with the
theory of relativity, it`s no wonder that


61
0:4:38,4 --> 0:4:42,91
a lot of people think of Einstein as a genius.
And that`s why there is a lot interest in


62
0:4:42,91 --> 0:4:47,94
the organ that did Einstein`s thinking: his
brain. Some photographs were published recently


63
0:4:47,94 --> 0:4:53,4
that show Einstein`s brain after he died.
Scientists were eager to get a look and see


64
0:4:53,4 --> 0:4:58,88
if there were any clues to the famous Germans
genius. Doctor Sanjay Gupta has more on this.


65
0:4:58,88 --> 0:4:59,41
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


66
0:4:59,41 --> 0:5:2,68
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Let me
just say as a starting point. You know, for


67
0:5:2,68 --> 0:5:6,87
the last nearly half century now, people have
been fascinated with trying to figure out


68
0:5:6,87 --> 0:5:10,44
what it was about Einstein brain that might
be different. And let`s take a look at these


69
0:5:10,44 --> 0:5:15,11
images. Here, it`s a good place to start,
specifically looking at all those ridges and


70
0:5:15,11 --> 0:5:20,4
valleys on the brain. These convolutions that
are sort of -- they develop as the brain is


71
0:5:20,4 --> 0:5:21,71
developing as someone ages.


72
0:5:21,71 --> 0:5:26,54
What do we know about his brain is that he
had more of these ridges and valleys. And


73
0:5:26,54 --> 0:5:30,35
the reason that`s significant is you just
think about that -- as the result of those


74
0:5:30,35 --> 0:5:35,7
increased ridges and valleys and convolutions,
you get more surface area. You get more neurons


75
0:5:35,7 --> 0:5:39,42
and you have more capacity for different parts
of the brain to talk to each other.


76
0:5:39,42 --> 0:5:42,97
It doesn`t necessarily means someone`s going
to be more intelligent, I think it`s best


77
0:5:42,97 --> 0:5:47,22
to say that they have the capacity for higher
intelligence because of that increased surface


78
0:5:47,22 --> 0:5:47,82
area neurons.


79
0:5:47,82 --> 0:5:51,51
There is also a couple of other things that
people really honed in on, again, in terms


80
0:5:51,51 --> 0:5:56,29
of differences. Take a look at this image
over here. That`s frontal lobe area, and in


81
0:5:56,29 --> 0:6:1,69
most people whose brains have been examined
that area of the brain is fused, but if you


82
0:6:1,69 --> 0:6:5,8
look at that red line there, that`s an area
of the brain of Albert Einstein where it was


83
0:6:5,8 --> 0:6:9,2
actually split. This is an executive area
of the brain. This is where you implement


84
0:6:9,2 --> 0:6:14,9
things, get things done. He had a higher executive
sort of capability there.


85
0:6:14,9 --> 0:6:17,919
Again, it doesn`t necessarily correlate directly
with intelligence, but it does correlate with


86
0:6:17,919 --> 0:6:23,23
this idea that if you have significant thoughts,
to be able to do something with those could


87
0:6:23,23 --> 0:6:25,139
be -- you could have a greater capacity for
that.


88
0:6:25,139 --> 0:6:28,84
A lot of people ask, you know, what does it
mean for us? Could my brain be like Einstein?


89
0:6:28,84 --> 0:6:32,44
There is more (inaudible) things that he was
born with. There are certain areas of the


90
0:6:32,44 --> 0:6:36,26
brain like look at this area over here that`s
sort of upside down a horse shoe. That`s an


91
0:6:36,26 --> 0:6:40,9
area of the brain that`s responsible typically
for motor control of the hand. In this case,


92
0:6:40,9 --> 0:6:44,63
the left hand. And now you`d look at that
area and you realize it, because it`s bigger


93
0:6:44,63 --> 0:6:48,6
like that, it`s typically associated with
someone who`s very good with their hands.


94
0:6:48,6 --> 0:6:51,29
In this case, Einstein was a musician, played
the violin.


95
0:6:51,29 --> 0:6:54,79
But that is not something that people are
born with. That is something that develops.


96
0:6:54,79 --> 0:6:59,26
And that gives us a little bit of an insight
into other parts of his brain as well that


97
0:6:59,26 --> 0:7:3,91
may have increased in size, may have increased
in capacity as a result of all the work that


98
0:7:3,91 --> 0:7:6,75
he was doing. It`s fascinating stuff. Back
to you.

HIILLARY CLINTON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:
Make no mistake about it - - HIV may well


102
0:7:13,55 --> 0:7:20,93
be with us into the future, but the disease
that it causes, need not be.


103
0:7:20,93 --> 0:7:27,99
We can reach a point where virtually no children
are born with the virus and as these children


104
0:7:27,99 --> 0:7:35,949
become teenagers and adults, they are at a
far lower risk of becoming infected than they


105
0:7:35,949 --> 0:7:37,44
are today.


106
0:7:37,44 --> 0:7:41,34
(END VIDEO CLIP)


107
0:7:41,34 --> 0:7:46,43
AZUZ: You heard Secretary Clinton mention
the disease that HIV causes. She`s talking


108
0:7:46,43 --> 0:7:52,449
about AIDS, which stands for acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome. Tomorrow, December First is world


109
0:7:52,449 --> 0:7:56,96
AIDS day. It`s the time to support the millions
of people living with these disease and honor


110
0:7:56,96 --> 0:7:58,979
those who have lost their lives to it.


111
0:7:58,979 --> 0:8:3,65
Around 34 million people around the world
have AIDS. New cases are recorded every year.


112
0:8:3,65 --> 0:8:8,33
But the number of new cases is decreasing.
And yesterday, Secretary Clinton announced


113
0:8:8,33 --> 0:8:13,669
a plan that aims to get rid of AIDS, but focuses
on preventing the spread of the disease and


114
0:8:13,669 --> 0:8:15,71
improving treatment for people who have it.


115
0:8:15,71 --> 0:8:15,87
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


116
0:8:15,87 --> 0:8:17,46
CLINTON: Thank you all very much.

0:8:17,46 --> 0:8:18,3
(END VIDEO CLIP)


118
0:8:18,3 --> 0:8:21,83
AZUZ: "CNN Heroes": ordinary people doing
extraordinary things to make a difference


119
0:8:21,83 --> 0:8:26,85
in their communities. We know who this year`s
top ten are on Sunday night and all-star tribute


120
0:8:26,85 --> 0:8:31,83
honors them and announces the hero of the
year. A special program starts at 8 p.m. Eastern


121
0:8:31,83 --> 0:8:38,209
on CNN. Then the CNN "Heroes " tribute as
it 9 Eastern, 6 central. It`s this Sunday,


122
0:8:38,209 --> 0:8:41,999
so check it out.


123
0:8:41,999 --> 0:8:47,809
When you step off an airplane you might hope
to be greeted by a friendly face. Not this


124
0:8:47,809 --> 0:8:52,769
one. It`s what visitors to Wellington, New
Zealand are coming face to face with for a


125
0:8:52,769 --> 0:8:57,79
few months, though. Gollum can be a larger
than life character in the "Lord of the Rings"


126
0:8:57,79 --> 0:9:2,99
and the "Hobbit" movies. And at this airport,
he`s just larger than a life. The 43 foot


127
0:9:2,99 --> 0:9:8,89
sculpture -- it`s 43 feet high, and it`s part
of a publicity campaign, but it`s only going


128
0:9:8,89 --> 0:9:12,24
to be up for a while. So we don`t think this
kind of thing is going to be habitual. Now,


129
0:9:12,24 --> 0:9:15,6
I don`t think anybody is going to make the
mistake of calling it cute, although some


130
0:9:15,6 --> 0:9:19,879
might see it as precious. Calling it that,
though, would take some Gollum. We know these


131
0:9:19,879 --> 0:9:23,79
puns will get a ringing endorsement for some
of you , but we really only have two options:


132
0:9:23,79 --> 0:9:28,9
more, door -- we`re just going to baggins
them. Those of you who follow the "Lord of


133
0:9:28,9 --> 0:9:31,619
the Rings" are like OK, OK, the rest of you
like. So we`re just going to end in there.


134
0:9:31,619 --> 0:11:31,619
We`ll see you next Monday with more news and
more puns. Bye now.
