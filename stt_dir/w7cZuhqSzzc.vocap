###5 DARFUR...
###5 GUATEMALA...
###5 THE NAZI KILLERS...
###6 Narrator: GENOCIDE.
###8 I MEAN, WHY WERE THEY DOING THIS?
###8 TERROR.
###9 BEST-SELLING HISTORIAN DANIEL GOLDHAGEN
###11 EXPLORES THE MOTIVE...
###13 GENOCIDE NEVER HAPPENS AS A SURPRISE.
###15 AND EXPLODES THE MYTH...
###17 THESE PEOPLE HAD TO BE ELIMINATED.
###18 BEHIND A CRIME...
###20 IT WAS CRUELTY THAT OVERCAME US,
###22 ME AND MY FELLOW CRIMINALS.
###23 GENOCIDE IS ALWAYS POLITICS.
###26 THAT'S WORSE THAN WAR.
###28 CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY FRIENDS OF NCI
###33 "WORSE THAN WAR" WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY...
###36 THE PERSHING SQUARE FOUNDATION...
###41 AND THE EINHORN FAMILY CHARITABLE TRUST.
###47 ADDITIONAL FUNDING WAS PROVIDED BY...
###67 [BIRD CHIRPING]
###74 Man: SO ALL THE PEOPLE HERE MURDERED OTHER PEOPLE?
###78 [TRANSLATOR SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###81 YES. YOU CAN'T BE HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T KILLED.
###115 [BIRD CHIRPING]
###124 CAN YOU SHOW ME HOW YOU-- HOW THE PERSON WAS HACKED?
###127 [TRANSLATOR SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###167 I'VE BEEN THINKING AND WRITING ABOUT GENOCIDE FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS,
###171 IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE DON'T MUCH LIKE TO TALK ABOUT
###174 AND ABOUT WHICH MOST OF US REMAIN DANGEROUSLY MISINFORMED.
###178 Woman: GOOD EVENING. A NEW BOOK CALLED "HITLER'S WILLING EXECUTIONERS,"
###182 A HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL ACCOUNT OF THE HOLOCAUST...
###184 Man: THE AMERICAN DANIEL GOLDHAGEN SAYS
###186 THE EXCUSE OF ONLY OBEYING ORDERS WON'T WASH.
###189 [MAN SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###192 Jane Pauley: A CONTROVERSIAL BOOK ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST,
###194 RAISING A TROUBLING NEW QUESTION:
###196 WERE NAZI KILLERS HELPED
###198 BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ORDINARY GERMANS?
###201 THEY SUBJECTED THE VICTIMS TO GRATUITOUS BRUTALITY,
###205 INCESSANT CRUELTY,
###206 SO THE PICTURE THAT EMERGES IS NOT OF RELUCTANT PEOPLE
###208 WHO ARE COMPELLED TO DO WHAT THEY DID,
###211 BUT PEOPLE WHO AGREED WITH THE PROGRAM, WHO BELIEVED
###214 THAT THE DEATH OF THE JEWS WAS NECESSARY AND JUST.
###220 Goldhagen: I'VE SPENT MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE TRYING TO DISPEL THE MANY MYTHS
###224 THAT CLOUD PEOPLE'S JUDGMENT AND PREVENT US FROM DOING
###226 SOMETHING EFFECTIVE TO STOP THE KILLING.
###236 GENOCIDES HAPPEN IN EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD,
###239 THROUGH EVERY TYPE OF PEOPLE.
###243 THE NUMBERS IN THE PAST 100 YEARS ARE STAGGERING.
###249 THE TURKS SLAUGHTERED MORE THAN A MILLION ARMENIANS DURING WORLD WAR I.
###254 IN THE 1930s AND 1940s,
###257 THE JAPANESE KILLED MILLIONS ACROSS ASIA.
###262 IN THE SOVIET UNION,
###264 THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF DEATHS IN THE GULAG CAMPS
###266 AND BEYOND IS MORE THAN 8 MILLION.
###270 THE GERMANS SLAUGHTERED 6 MILLION JEWS
###273 AND MILLIONS MORE DURING WORLD WAR II.
###276 IN THE 1950s AND 1960s,
###278 THE COMMUNIST CHINESE KILLED AN ESTIMATED 30 MILLION,
###283 AND DURING THE 1970s,
###285 THE KHMER ROUGE KILLED 1.7 MILLION CAMBODIANS--
###288 FULLY 20% OF THEIR COUNTRY'S POPULATION.
###292 BOSNIA,
###294 RWANDA,
###295 CONGO,
###296 DARFUR.
###298 ALL TOLD, IN OUR TIME
###301 THERE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 100 MILLION INNOCENT VICTIMS OF GENOCIDE--
###305 MORE THAN ALL THE COMBAT DEATHS IN ALL THE WARS FOUGHT
###309 DURING THAT TIME EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
###313 BASED ON THE HUMAN TOLL ALONE, GENOCIDE AND MASS SLAUGHTER
###317 ARE WORSE PROBLEMS PLAGUING HUMANITY THAN WAR.
###321 WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY.
###327 Man: IT IS A GREAT, DIFFICULT TASK YOU'RE FACING
###330 TO CONVEY HUMAN BEINGS WHOSE BEHAVIOR SEEMS TO DEFY UNDERSTANDING,
###335 AND THEY WERE BEYOND BELIEF.
###337 Goldhagen, voice-over: IN MY WORK, I HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE WISDOM
###339 OF A VALUED MENTOR,
###340 A SCHOLAR OF GENOCIDE,
###342 AND SURVIVOR OF THE HOLOCAUST.
###344 BUT, YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT, THOUGH--
###346 BUT LET ME JUST REMIND YOU...
###348 HE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE MY FATHER.
###350 WHEN THE FIRST NEWS OF THE GAS CHAMBERS CAME,
###353 THE JEWISH COMMUNITY WAS VERY SKEPTICAL OF IT.
###356 RIGHT, BUT WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT TIME NOW.
###358 NOBODY DISBELIEVES THAT THESE THINGS HAPPENED.
###360 THAT'S QUITE TRUE.
###361 WHAT THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING--
###363 IS WHY IT HAPPENED, YES.
###365 AND ACCEPTING NOTIONS THAT VIOLATE THEIR OWN
###369 COMMON-SENSE UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE WORLD.
###371 THERE'S A CERTAIN PARADOX HERE
###373 BECAUSE SOMETIMES ONE ACCEPTS VERY HIGHLY,
###376 SEEMINGLY ORIGINAL, PROFOUND THEORIES,
###379 AND SOMETIMES THE EXPLANATION IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE.
###383 I THINK THE ACTUAL EXPLANATIONS ARE--
###386 ARE THREATENING AND UNSETTLING TO PEOPLE.
###389 THE NOTION THAT ORDINARY PEOPLE WOULD WILLFULLY BUTCHER OTHER PEOPLE,
###392 TORTURE THEM, INCLUDING CHILDREN, SLAUGHTER THEM,
###395 IS A VERY DISTURBING NOTION TO PEOPLE,
###397 PARTICULARLY IF THEY'RE LOOKING UPON PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY IDENTIFY.
###400 SO THEY SEEK EXPLANATIONS WHICH ARE MORE--
###402 I WOULDN'T SAY MORE COMFORTING, BUT LESS THREATENING TO THEM...
###405 Goldhagen, voice-over: AS EARLY AS I CAN REMEMBER THINKING SERIOUS THOUGHTS,
###408 MY FATHER AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS.
###412 AS A SCHOLAR, HE JOURNEYED INTO THE DARKEST CHAPTERS OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE,
###416 SEEKING TO UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY WHAT HAPPENED, BUT WHY.
###421 NOW I AM CONTINUING THE JOURNEY HE BEGAN,
###425 A JOURNEY THAT IN A SENSE, I HAVE BEEN ON MY ENTIRE LIFE.
###438 PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOTHING IS INEVITABLE ABOUT GENOCIDE.
###444 IT BOILS DOWN TO A SERIES OF CHOICES.
###452 LEADERS CHOOSE TO INITIATE THE KILLING,
###455 ORDINARY PEOPLE MAKE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO PARTICIPATE...
###462 AND THOSE WITH THE POWER TO PREVENT OR STOP IT
###465 CHOOSE TO DO NOTHING.
###470 I STUDY GENOCIDES BECAUSE I BELIEVE
###473 THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT HOW AND WHY GENOCIDES HAPPEN,
###476 THE MORE WE CAN GET POLITICAL LEADERS
###478 AND ORDINARY PEOPLE TO MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES.
###484 IMAGINE IF ONE DAY, PEOPLE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
###487 WERE DRAGGED OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND KILLED IN THE STREET.
###495 YOU WOULD WANT THE KILLERS STOPPED AND PUNISHED,
###498 AND YOU WOULD WANT TO KNOW THAT IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
###502 WHY SHOULD IT BE ANY DIFFERENT
###505 WHEN THE VICTIMS ARE SOMEWHERE ELSE?
###509 LIKE THE PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY,
###512 EACH GENOCIDE VICTIM IS AN INDIVIDUAL.
###514 A FATHER, A MOTHER, A DAUGHTER, A SON.
###523 AS A SCHOLAR, I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME IN ARCHIVES AND LIBRARIES.
###527 BUT OVER THE PAST YEAR, I TRAVELED TO THESE "SOMEWHERE ELSES,"
###531 THE SITES OF SOME OF THE WORST MASS MURDERS OF OUR TIME.
###536 [BIRDS CHIRPING]
###542 [DOOR CLANGS]
###547 IT'S BEEN DECADES STUDYING NAZIS AND THE HOLOCAUST, GENOCIDE,
###553 BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A GAS CHAMBER BEFORE.
###563 I STARTED MY JOURNEY MINDFUL
###565 THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME DURING THE PAST CENTURY
###568 WHEN OUR PLANET WAS FREE OF MASS MURDER,
###571 INCLUDING NOW.
###573 Woman: FOR 5 LONG YEARS,
###575 DARFUR HAS BEEN A SCENE OF DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION.
###578 300,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED
###581 AND 2.5 MILLION HAVE FLED THEIR HOMES
###583 AS THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO CRUSH A REBELLION
###586 AGAINST ITS RULE.
###589 Goldhagen: THE PLIGHT OF DARFUR HAS MOVED PEOPLE OF CONSCIENCE AROUND THE WORLD
###593 AND HAS ONLY INTENSIFIED MY DESIRE TO KNOW MORE...
###599 TO SEE THE PLACES WHERE THE HORRORS HAVE HAPPENED,
###602 MEET THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE,
###605 AND ASK THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TO ASK,
###608 EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES YOU MAY DREAD HEARING THE ANSWER.
###615 Goldhagen: WHEN THE GENOCIDE BEGAN, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
###618 [TRANSLATOR SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###620 AND HER FAMILY.
###631 SHE SAID HER DAD WAS KILLED LIKE--
###634 HE WAS, YOU KNOW, CHOPPED. HE WAS CUT WITH A MACHETE.
###640 AND THE MOM WAS CHOPPED. THAT WHAT SHE'S SAYING
###643 IS SHE WAS CHOPPED WITH A MACHETE.
###648 AND THE BROTHER WAS, ALSO.
###652 WHO KILLED HER FAMILY?
###654 WERE THESE JUST LOCAL PEOPLE WHO LIVE THROUGH HERE?
###656 [TRANSLATOR SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###661 SHE SAYS THEY WERE NEIGHBORS.
###663 MOST OF THAT, THEY WERE EVEN FRIENDS TO THE FAMILY.
###678 [COW BELLOWS]
###682 Goldhagen: IN GENOCIDE AFTER GENOCIDE,
###685 THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT CONTINUE TO BE ASKED:
###688 HOW DO NEIGHBORS END UP TURNING AGAINST NEIGHBORS?
###691 WHY DO THE KILLERS KILL?
###695 HERE IN RWANDA,
###697 MORE THAN 800,000 MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN
###701 WERE KILLED OVER THE COURSE OF 3 MONTHS.
###706 MOST WERE ETHNIC TUTSI,
###708 MURDERED BY MEMBERS OF THE HUTU MAJORITY,
###711 FACE TO FACE WITH MACHETES,
###714 CLUBS, AND GUNS.
###719 HITLER'S GAS CHAMBERS DID NOT KILL WITH SUCH DEADLY EFFICIENCY.
###749 Goldhagen: WHEN PEOPLE KILLED THE VICTIMS,
###751 DID THEY TRY TO KILL THEM AS PAINLESSLY AS POSSIBLE
###755 OR DID THEY TRY TO MAKE THEM SUFFER?
###757 [TRANSLATOR SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###784 Goldhagen: I FIND IT HARD TO UNDERSTAND, AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND,
###788 HOW PEOPLE COULD APPROACH OTHER PEOPLE,
###791 WHO ARE BEGGING FOR THEIR LIVES AND SCREAMING IN PAIN,
###795 AND CHOP THEM.
###806 IT'S A VERY TOUGH QUESTION TO ANSWER
###808 BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE SAME FLESH, LIKE YOURS.
###882 ELIE'S WORD--CRUELTY-- COULD NOT BE MORE ACCURATE.
###886 CRUELTY IS AT THE HEART OF GENOCIDE.
###889 THE KILLERS DON'T JUST ERADICATE THE TARGETED PEOPLE,
###893 BUT BRUTALIZE THEM IN WAYS THAT FAR EXCEED
###896 WHAT IS NEEDED TO KILL THEM.
###900 I SEE THE EVIDENCE OF SUCH CRUELTY EVERYWHERE I GO.
###907 I CAME TO GUATEMALA, WHERE A MASSIVE EFFORT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY
###911 TO LITERALLY UNCOVER THE TRUTH ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S MASS SLAUGHTER
###915 OF 200,000 INDIGENOUS MAYA DURING THE 1980s.
###924 OUTSIDE GUATEMALA, FEW PEOPLE EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE GENOCIDE.
###928 Suasnavar: BUENOS DIAS.
###939 Goldhagen: DO WE KNOW--IS THIS A FAMILY OR TWO FAMILIES? ARE THERE ADULTS?
###987 Goldhagen: IN THESE HILLS,
###988 THE GUATEMALAN MILITARY CONDUCTED A SCORCHED-EARTH CAMPAIGN
###992 AGAINST MAYA AND LEFTIST INSURGENTS.
###996 THE MAYAN PEOPLE, THEY SAID, WERE INHERENTLY SUBVERSIVE
###999 AND AN IMPEDIMENT TO PROGRESS.
###1007 THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY WAS SUMMED UP
###1009 IN A GRIM APHORISM OF THE TIME--
###1012 "TO KILL THE FISH, YOU HAVE TO DRAIN THE POND."
###1021 HERE, IN THE MOUNTAIN HAMLET OF PLAN DE SANCHEZ,
###1025 THEY DRAINED THE POND ON JULY 18, 1982.
###1047 Woman: THE MILITARY WOULD SEPARATE THE WOMEN AND THE MEN.
###1051 SOMETIMES THEY WOULD TAKE THE INFANTS OUT OF THE WOMEN'S ARMS
###1055 AND SIMPLY SMASH THEM ON THE GROUND,
###1057 KILL THEM RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.
###1059 THEY CUT TONGUES OUT.
###1061 THEY OPENED PREGNANT WOMEN'S BELLIES
###1063 AND DASHED FETUSES AGAINST TREES.
###1066 THEY BURNED PEOPLE ALIVE.
###1069 WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE THERE WERE PEOPLE
###1073 WHO, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THIS MAYHEM AND MASS KILLING,
###1077 SOMEHOW MANAGED TO HIDE-- BEHIND A DOOR,
###1080 UNDERNEATH A PILE OF CORN HUSKS--
###1084 AND WATCH.
###1163 Goldhagen: ONLY ONCE I GOT TO GUATEMALA DID I REALIZE
###1166 HOW REMOTE THESE MOUNTAIN VILLAGES REALLY ARE.
###1169 GOVERNMENT LEADERS CALL THESE SUBSISTENCE FARMERS
###1172 A THREAT TO THE WELL-BEING OF THE COUNTRY,
###1175 BUT THEY DID NOT POSE A THREAT TO ANYONE.
###1179 THE GUATEMALAN PERPETRATORS OBLITERATED ONE SUCH COMMUNITY AFTER ANOTHER.
###1253 Goldhagen: EVERYWHERE I GO, THE FACES OF CHILDREN HAUNT ME THE MOST.
###1258 I HAVE CHILDREN, TOO,
###1260 AND IT'S HARD NOT TO THINK ABOUT THEM AS I HEAR STORIES
###1263 OVER AND OVER ABOUT THE CRUELTY CHILDREN SUFFERED.
###1267 ...WHEN THEY KILLED ABOUT 177 PEOPLE,
###1271 MOST OF THEM CHILDREN AND THE OTHERS WOMEN.
###1273 SO THERE WASN'T A SINGLE ADULT MALE, SO WHICH CAN--
###1277 YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SAY LETS YOU UNDERSTAND
###1279 THAT THESE ARE NOT COMBAT DEATHS.
###1281 OH, NO. YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY COMMON IN MASS MURDERS
###1284 FOR THE PERPETRATORS TO DO THIS TO CHILDREN...
###1284 YEAH.
###1287 AFTER RWANDA AND THE HOLOCAUST.
###1289 Goldhagen, voice-over: FREDY PECCERELLI, A GUATEMALAN NATIVE RAISED IN AMERICA,
###1292 IS IN CHARGE OF COLLECTING AND CATALOGUING THE BONES.
###1295 THEY PORTRAY A MESSAGE. WHEN THEY DO THIS,
###1298 THEY ARE ALSO KILLING THE SEED OF EVIL, ACCORDING TO THEM,
###1301 WHETHER IT BE IN NAZI GERMANY
###1303 OR WHETHER IT BE IN GUATEMALA IN THE 1980s.
###1305 BUT THIS IS THE BONE LAB OF THE FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY LABORATORY.
###1309 FREDY IS AMASSING A RECORD OF THE ATROCITIES
###1312 COMMITTED BY THE GUATEMALAN PERPETRATORS...
###1314 BUT THE FIRST STAGE AFTER THE...
###1316 AND PROVIDING THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES WITH THE REMAINS TO BURY PROPERLY.
###1320 Peccerelli: THE BONES HOLD THE STORY
###1322 OF WHAT HAPPENED TO A PERSON DURING THEIR LIFE
###1325 AND MIGHT EVEN TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM
###1328 DURING THE EVENT OF THEIR DEATH
###1330 AND EVEN WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AFTER DEATH.
###1332 SO HERE, FOR EXAMPLE, WE CAN SEE...HOW...
###1336 AND IF YOU WANT, I'LL ALLOW YOU TO FEEL THE DIFFERENCE SO YOU CAN SEE.
###1340 THIS IS A VERY SHARP CUT, AND IF YOU RUN YOUR HAND THROUGH IT,
###1343 IT'S VERY, VERY SMOOTH.
###1343 MM-HMM.
###1345 YOU SEE, THAT WAS CAUSED BY A MACHETE STRIKING
###1348 THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HEAD AND ALSO CUTTING THE ATLAS.
###1352 AND, YOU SEE, WHEN YOU MATCH IT UP ANATOMICALLY,
###1355 YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS TRAUMA HERE...
###1355 RIGHT.
###1358 IS RELATED TO THIS STRIKE HERE,
###1360 AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY TRIED TO DO HERE IS DECAPITATE THE PERSON.
###1362 NOW, WHAT WE'VE SEEN USUALLY IS THAT
###1365 THESE PEOPLE WERE NOT VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE OF ANATOMY,
###1368 SO THE DECAPITATIONS, AS YOU'D EXPECT,
###1371 WERE NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL, SO YOU HAVE REPEATED BLOWS TO THE HEAD.
###1374 SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO SEPARATE THE HEAD FROM THE BODY.
###1376 THEY'RE VERY TYPICAL OF OVERKILL AND SOMETIMES OF EVEN CRIMES OF PASSION.
###1380 Goldhagen: "OVERKILL"-- THERE'S A WORD
###1382 I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER HEAR THE SAME WAY AGAIN.
###1385 IF THE KILLERS WERE SIMPLY DOING THEIR DUTY
###1388 TO WIPE OUT AN INSURGENCY, AS THEY CLAIM,
###1390 THEY WOULD EXECUTE THEIR VICTIMS QUICKLY AND BE DONE WITH IT.
###1394 YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHY WE SEE SO MUCH EVIDENCE OF SUCH MURDEROUS PASSION,
###1399 ESPECIALLY AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
###1401 THIS IS A CHILD HERE, A VERY YOUNG CHILD.
###1404 I WOULDN'T EVEN DARE TO TELL YOU THE AGE
###1406 UNLESS WITH THE ANTHROPOLOGIST WORKING ON THE CASE,
###1408 AND YOU CAN COMPARE-- THIS IS THE FIRST RIB.
###1411 WOW.
###1414 SO...AND IF YOU COMPARE THIS
###1417 TO THAT ONE, YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE.
###1419 I MEAN, THE FIRST RIB IS ABOUT THAT BIG, SO THIS IS A VERY, VERY SMALL--
###1422 MAY I SEE THIS?
###1423 JUST HOLDING THE TINY LITTLE BONE.
###1426 YOU KNOW...
###1430 YEAH. SEE, I DON'T KNOW.
###1432 I DON'T THINK THERE'S A--A WAY OF...
###1434 HUMANLY UNDERSTANDING THIS
###1436 BECAUSE IT GOES BEYOND WHAT I BELIEVE HUMANS CAN DO,
###1440 BUT OBVIOUSLY--I MEAN, THE MORE I SAY THAT, THE MORE I TEND TO--
###1442 IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE
###1444 THAT YOU'RE SAYING THIS, GIVEN WHAT YOU--
###1446 BECAUSE I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE NOT CAPABLE OF THESE THINGS,
###1450 EVEN THOUGH-- I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS WRONG.
###1452 SO DOING THIS HAS TO BE WRONG.
###1454 IF I ACCEPTED THIS AS RIGHT AND IF I EXCUSE IT,
###1457 THEN I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.
###1463 FREDY IS NOT ALONE.
###1466 MOST OF US FIND IT HARD TO COME TO TERMS
###1469 WITH THE CAPACITY OF HUMAN BEINGS TO DO SUCH HORRIBLE THINGS TO OTHERS.
###1473 BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SENSE OF IT.
###1476 AS IRRATIONAL AS THEY SEEM, THESE ARE NOT THE ACTS OF CRAZED INDIVIDUALS.
###1482 THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING,
###1485 BELIEVE IT'S RIGHT, AND MAKE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO ACT.
###1489 UH, HELLO.
###1491 JA.
###1491 ICH BIN DANIEL GOLDHAGEN.
###1493 [SPEAKING GERMAN]
###1549 Goldhagen: LIKE MOST GERMANS, OTTO-ERNST DUSCHELEIT GREW UP WITH THE WORLD VIEW
###1554 IN WHICH HE SAW HIMSELF AS A MEMBER OF THE MASTER RACE,
###1557 WHILE MANY OTHERS FELL INTO THE CATEGORY OF SUB-HUMANS OR UNTERMENSCHEN.
###1562 [MEN SINGING IN GERMAN]
###1569 Goldhagen: WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL...
###1571 YES?
###1571 WHEN YOU WERE IN THE HITLER YOUTH,
###1573 WHAT DID YOU LEARN, FOR EXAMPLE, ABOUT UNTERMENSCHEN?
###1575 WHAT DID THAT WORD MEAN TO YOU?
###1575 JA, UNTERMENSCHEN.
###1656 Goldhagen: IT'S STRIKING THAT IT IS A FORMER SS MAN,
###1659 INVOKING ANNE FRANK, WHO MAKES THIS POINT.
###1662 IT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE.
###1665 IT IS THAT FAILURE TO SEE THE HUMANITY IN OTHERS
###1667 WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE KILLERS TO COMMIT THEIR CRIMES.
###1673 I WOULD ADD THAT IT'S THE BELIEF
###1675 THAT THOSE OTHERS ARE DANGEROUS ENEMIES
###1677 WHICH INSPIRES THE PERPETRATORS TO KILL WITH SUCH ZEAL.
###1690 YEARS AGO, I ENCOUNTERED AN EPISODE OF THE HOLOCAUST
###1693 WHICH SPOKE VOLUMES ABOUT THE WILLFULNESS AND DEDICATION OF THE KILLERS,
###1697 AND I GOT TO KNOW ONE OF THE SURVIVORS, LILLI SILBIGER.
###1702 I HAVE A MAP HERE WITH ME WHICH ACTUALLY OUTLINES THE ROUTE
###1706 FROM HELMBRECHT TO VOLARY...
###1710 Goldhagen, voice-over: IN THE LAST MONTHS OF WORLD WAR II,
###1713 AS THE ALLIED FORCES NEARED THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS HOUSING JEWS AND OTHERS,
###1717 GERMANS EMPTIED THEIR CAMPS AND DROVE THEIR PRISONERS
###1720 ON FORCED MARCHES THROUGH THE NEARBY TOWNS AND COUNTRYSIDE.
###1724 [SILBIGER SPEAKING GERMAN]
###1726 Goldhagen: THE DEATH MARCHES LEFT A TRAIL OF CORPSES IN THEIR WAKE,
###1730 AND THE MARCHING PRISONERS WERE DESCRIBED BY MORE THAN ONE WITNESS
###1733 AS "THE WALKING DEAD."
###1736 THESE ARE ACTUAL PHOTOS OF THE YOUNG WOMEN
###1739 WHO WERE WITH LILLI ON THE MARCH.
###1753 ON THE SUMMER DAY LILY REVISITED THE ROUTE OF A DEATH MARCH WITH ME,
###1757 THE COUNTRYSIDE WAS BEAUTIFUL.
###1760 BUT IN THE SPRING OF 1945, IT WAS COLD AND BLEAK.
###1768 LILY'S GUARDS ACTUALLY HAD RECEIVED EXPLICIT ORDERS NOT TO KILL ANY MORE JEWS,
###1773 BUT THEY WILLFULLY DEFIED THEIR SUPERIORS.
###1777 THEY DROVE HER AND THE OTHERS, STARVING, WEARING NOTHING MORE THAN RAGS,
###1780 DAY AFTER DAY THROUGH THE FRIGID COUNTRYSIDE.
###1784 SOMETIMES WE WOULDN'T EVEN GET FOOD FOR 24 HOURS, FOR 48 HOURS.
###1787 PEOPLE RESORTED TO ANYTHING THAT WAS FOUND
###1790 OR ANYTHING ROTTEN THAT WAS--YOU KNOW, YOU JUST GRABBED AT ANYTHING.
###1794 AND YOU WERE 16 AT THE TIME?
###1794 YEAH.
###1797 AND IN ONE PLACE, SOMEONE BROKE INTO A PANTRY
###1801 OR SOMEPLACE WHERE WE ARRIVED AND STOLE SOME LOAFS OF BREAD.
###1805 AND FOR THAT, THEY SELECTED 50 GIRLS AND KILLED THEM
###1809 OVER THE MASS GRAVE THERE.
###1812 WE HAD TO COME BACK AND COVER THEM,
###1816 AND THERE WERE MANY OF THEM STILL ALIVE WHEN WE HAD TO DO THAT.
###1820 SO THEY--YOU HAD TO HELP BURY THEM ALIVE?
###1823 WE HAD TO DO-- WE HAD TO PUT--
###1826 YES, THE EARTH, COVER THEM WITH EARTH.
###1829 SO THIS WAS THE BIGGEST HORRIBLE...
###1834 [VOICE CRACKS] YEAH....
###1838 PERIOD.
###1841 [DISTANT ROLLING THUNDER]
###1847 ONE OF THE ASTONISHING THINGS IS THAT THEY WERE MARCHING THE JEWISH PRISONERS
###1852 LITERALLY THE LAST DAY OF THE WAR.
###1855 INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY TO AVOID CAPTURE, THEY STAYED WITH THE PRISONERS,
###1858 THEY CONTINUED TO DENY THEM FOOD...
###1858 ABSOLUTELY.
###1860 THEY CONTINUED TO BEAT THEM, THEY CONTINUED TO KILL THEM,
###1863 THEY CONTINUED TO DO IT TO THE VERY END.
###1870 WE KNEW THE RUSSIANS WERE CLOSING IN THERE,
###1872 AND THEN WE HEARD ARTILLERY,
###1874 SOME PLANES FLYING OVERHEAD,
###1877 HEARD SOME BOMBINGS IN THE DISTANCE,
###1879 SO WE KNEW THEY WERE VERY CLOSE.
###1883 [EXPLOSIONS, GUNFIRE]
###1888 THEY MANAGED FOR SUCH A LONG TIME TO KEEP AHEAD OF THE ALLIES,
###1893 GOING NOWHERE, YOU KNOW, TO--A PLACE--TO NOWHERE.
###1896 JUST TO DRAG US, JUST TO...
###1899 JUST GO IN CIRCLES, ACTUALLY. THAT'S WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
###1902 THEY DIDN'T KNOW THEMSELVES WHAT THEY WERE DOING.
###1905 THEY COULD HAVE EASILY LEFT US WHEREVER WE WERE
###1909 AND JUST DISAPPEAR, AND THEY DIDN'T.
###1912 THEY BELIEVED THE JEWS WERE EVIL INCARNATE, AN ENEMY OF HUMANKIND,
###1916 A THREAT TO THE WELL-BEING AND FUTURE EXISTENCE OF GERMANY.
###1920 AND IF YOU BELIEVE THAT,
###1922 JUST AS IF YOU BELIEVE SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO ATTACK YOUR CHILD,
###1925 YOU WILL DO ANYTHING YOU CAN.
###1929 YEAH.
###1931 [CAR HORN HONKS]
###1933 EACH OF US TRIES TO MAKE SENSE OF THE HORRORS IN HIS OR HER OWN WAY.
###1938 OVER THE YEARS, I HAVE TALKED WITH MANY WHO GRAPPLE OVER THESE ISSUES,
###1942 BUT NEVER ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN A MAN I MET IN RWANDA--
###1946 THARCISSE KARUGARAMA, THE COUNTRY'S MINISTER OF JUSTICE.
###1950 Goldhagen: HERE WE'RE SPEAKING NOW AS TWO PEOPLE TRYING
###1952 TO UNDERSTAND A VERY DIFFICULT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES:
###1955 THE WAYS IN WHICH VICTIMS WERE NOT JUST KILLED
###1957 IN, IF WE CAN CALL IT, THE LEAST PAINFUL WAY,
###1961 BUT WERE HACKED TO DEATH, WERE TORTURED;
###1964 THE ZEAL AND PASSION WITH WHICH THE PERPETRATORS SOUGHT OUT THE VICTIMS.
###1968 IT'S NOT EASY TO FIND PEOPLE HIDING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.
###1971 MASS HYSTERIA...
###1974 IS VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN.
###1980 PEOPLE HIT A PERIOD WHEN THEY'RE INVOLVED IN MASS HYSTERIA,
###1985 WHEN THEY CAN NO LONGER BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.
###1988 BUT YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT AS A LEGAL POSITION, DO YOU?
###1991 NO, DEFINITELY NOT. DEFINITELY NOT.
###1994 I'M JUST TRYING TO EXPLAIN BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AROUND
###1997 IN THIS JUDICIAL FOR SOME TIME NOW,
###2000 AND I'VE MADE ALL SORTS OF CONTRADICTIONS.
###2006 SO THE ONE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A MAJOR CONTRADICTION.
###2009 THE BRUTALITY WITH WHICH THEY DID THE KILLING IS SHOCKING.
###2016 WHAT...ONCE PEOPLE HAD STEPPED BEYOND
###2020 THE FIRST STEP OF ACTUALLY KILLING--
###2024 THROWING A CHILD DOWN AND HACKING THEM TO DEATH,
###2027 OPENING THE WOMB OF PREGNANT--
###2030 THERE'S NOTHING THAT WAS IF--THAT HE COULDN'T DO
###2032 BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING TOLD BY THE PETITIONS
###2036 WHO WERE GIVING THEM THE ALCOHOL
###2039 THAT "IF YOU DON'T DESTROY THESE PEOPLE, THESE ANIMALS, THESE--
###2042 THEY'RE COMING TO FINISH YOU. NONE OF YOU WILL SURVIVE."
###2047 AND THEY HAD BEEN MADE TO BELIEVE IT.
###2050 I DON'T WANT TO BE A--TO GIVE AN EXCUSE FOR THEM.
###2053 THEY ARE WILLING KILLERS. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.
###2057 BUT, SEE, AT THE BACK OF THEIR MIND, THE RADIO IS TELLING THEM,
###2060 "THEY'RE COMING TO FINISH YOU.
###2062 "IF YOU DON'T KILL THEM YOURSELVES, THEIR PLAN...
###2065 IS TO FINISH YOU."
###2074 Goldhagen: IN MASSACHUSETTS, I LIVE JUST A FEW MILES
###2077 FROM A LARGE COMMUNITY OF CAMBODIAN AMERICANS.
###2080 MANY OF THEM ARE SURVIVORS OF THE GENOCIDE THAT TOOK THE LIVES
###2084 OF 20% OF CAMBODIA'S POPULATION DURING THE 1970s--
###2089 ONE IN 5 CAMBODIANS.
###2091 [MEN SINGING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###2093 Goldhagen: IT IS A CHILLING STATISTIC.
###2103 IN THE SPRING OF 1975,
###2105 A COMMUNIST REBEL GROUP, THE KHMER ROUGE, CONQUERED THE COUNTRY.
###2110 THEY WANTED TO TURN CAMBODIA INTO A MARXIST AGRARIAN UTOPIA,
###2114 WHICH, TO THEM, MEANT DESTROYING VIRTUALLY ALL VESTIGES OF MODERN CIVILIZATION.
###2119 Man: FIRST DAY WHEN THEY MARCH INTO THE CITY,
###2121 AND WE'RE SO HAPPY THAT THE WAR IS ENDED.
###2124 WE WERE JOYFUL AND WE SAW THE SOLDIER CAME, THE PEACE COME,
###2128 AND NO MORE FIGHTING, NO MORE WAR,
###2131 AND THEN SUDDENLY EVERYTHING JUST DISAPPEARED.
###2135 I SAW A LOT OF SOLDIERS IN BLACK UNIFORMS CLOSE TO MY HOME.
###2141 [WHISTLE BLOWS]
###2143 THESE SOLDIERS SPRAYED EVERYWHERE, SHOOTING GUNS IN THE AIR
###2146 AND ASK, "LET'S GO, LET'S GO."
###2149 [DISTANT MACHINE GUNFIRE]
###2155 Goldhagen: WITHIN 3 DAYS, KHMER ROUGE CADRES EMPTIED CAMBODIA'S CITIES,
###2160 FORCING MILLIONS INTO THE RURAL CAMPS THEY CALLED COOPERATIVES,
###2164 BUT WHICH CAME TO BE KNOWN TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD AS THE KILLING FIELDS.
###2171 Uong: THINK OVER TWO MILE PER DAY, 3 MILE PER DAY
###2174 THAT WE COULDN'T MOVE BECAUSE OF SO MANY PEOPLE.
###2177 AND ALONG THE ROAD ARE BODIES ALONG THE ROAD EVERYWHERE.
###2180 THEY JUST-- THE SCENE IS JUST AWFUL.
###2186 Goldhagen: THE EXTENT OF THEIR VIOLENT TRANSFORMATION OF CAMBODIAN SOCIETY
###2190 STILL BOGGLES THE MIND.
###2194 AND IT WAS ALL BEGUN BY ONE MAN, KNOWN AS POL POT,
###2199 SUPPORTED BY A SMALL INNER CIRCLE.
###2204 GENOCIDE IS ALWAYS THE DECISION OF ONE LEADER
###2207 OR A SMALL GROUP OF LEADERS.
###2210 THESE INDIVIDUALS MAKE A CHOICE TO INITIATE THE KILLING,
###2213 WHICH, IN EVERY CASE, MEANS THEY COULD HAVE ALSO CHOSEN NOT TO.
###2218 THE LEADERS' GOALS VARY, DEPENDING ON THE TIME, PLACE, AND CIRCUMSTANCES:
###2224 POL POT WANTED TO RADICALLY TRANSFORM CAMBODIAN SOCIETY;
###2229 THE TURKISH LEADER MEHMED TALAAT WANTED TO SECURE TURKEY'S DECAYING EMPIRE;
###2235 ADOLF HITLER WANTED TO CREATE A VAST POLITICAL EMPIRE
###2240 RULED BY THE GERMAN MASTER RACE;
###2243 COLONEL THEONISTE BAGOSORA AND HIS FELLOW HUTU LEADERS
###2246 WANTED TO SECURE POLITICAL POWER IN RWANDA FOR THE HUTU;
###2251 AND IN THE BALKANS,
###2253 SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC WANTED TO PERMANENTLY REDRAW THE POLITICAL MAP OF THE REGION.
###2258 GENOCIDE IS ALWAYS POLITICS.
###2261 OF COURSE, THERE ARE POLITICAL GOALS.
###2263 THOSE POLITICAL GOALS CAN BE REACHED IN DIFFERENT WAYS.
###2266 SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT EXTERMINATING A GROUP WILL HELP THEIR GOALS,
###2271 SO THAT'S WHY THEY DO IT.
###2273 SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC THOUGHT AT THAT TIME,
###2276 THAT HE COULD, BECAUSE OF THE OVERWHELMING MILITARY POWER,
###2281 MAKE SOME TERRITORIAL GAINS IN CROATIA AND BOSNIA, SO HE ATTACKED.
###2298 [MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
###2301 Silajdzic: THE FULFILLING OF THEIR MISSION...
###2304 [EXPLOSION]
###2306 WAS...TO MAKE A GREATER SERBIA.
###2310 IN ORDER TO MAKE GREATER SERBIA,
###2312 YOU HAD TO EXTERMINATE PEOPLE IN YOUR WAY.
###2317 Man: SERBIA'S RIGHT THERE ACROSS THE DRINA RIVER,
###2320 AND LOTS OF SERB-CONTROLLED TERRITORY IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY,
###2325 THEY WANTED TO LINK THOSE TWO ZONES, RIGHT?
###2328 BUT IF YOU HAD LARGE-- A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF MUSLIMS
###2332 ALONG THE WESTERN BANKS OF THAT RIVER,
###2336 YOU HAD A KIND OF BARRIER BETWEEN THOSE TWO SERBIAN AREAS,
###2341 SO THESE PEOPLE HAD TO BE ELIMINATED.
###2343 Silajdzic: THESE THINGS ARE DONE IN COLD BLOOD.
###2345 THIS IS A DESIGN. THIS IS A PLAN.
###2348 THIS IS A CALCULATION, OF COURSE.
###2350 THIS IS NOT A REACTION TO SOMETHING.
###2353 THIS IS--THIS, UNFORTUNATELY, HERE IS A PLANNED GENOCIDE,
###2358 AS IS ANY OTHER GENOCIDE
###2361 BECAUSE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO KILL A BIG NUMBER OF PEOPLE
###2364 WITHOUT PRIOR PREPARATION:
###2367 MENTAL PREPARATION,
###2369 INTELLECTUAL PREPARATION,
###2372 MILITARY PREPARATION.
###2374 Goldhagen: PRESIDENT SILAJDZIC IS RIGHT.
###2377 THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION THAT GENOCIDES ERUPT SPONTANEOUSLY
###2381 OUT OF DEEP-SEATED PASSIONS OR ETHNIC CONFLICTS.
###2384 BUT THERE IS NOTHING SPONTANEOUS ABOUT GENOCIDE.
###2391 IN THIS VILLA IN THE SUBURBS OF BERLIN,
###2393 THE NAZI LEADERSHIP DISCUSSED THEIR DETAILED PLANS
###2396 TO EXTERMINATE THE JEWS OF EUROPE.
###2401 THESE TYPEWRITTEN MINUTES DOCUMENT THE MEETING
###2404 AND LIST COUNTRY BY COUNTRY THE 11 MILLION JEWS THEY PLAN TO KILL.
###2409 ONE OF THOSE WAS ERICH GOLDHAGEN,
###2412 THE 10-YEAR-OLD BOY IN WHAT WAS THEN ROMANIA, NOW UKRAINE,
###2416 WHO WOULD GROW UP TO BECOME MY FATHER.
###2419 THE NAZI VICTORY WOULD HAVE BEEN TANTAMOUNT, EVEN WORSE,
###2422 THAN--IT WOULD BE LIKE A NUCLEAR WAR, ALMOST.
###2424 THE DESTRUCTION WOULD BE...
###2424 MM-HMM.
###2426 IT IS PERHAPS EASIER TO RECOVER FROM A NUCLEAR ASSAULT
###2431 THAN IT WOULD BE FROM A NAZI VICTORY.
###2434 Goldhagen: I'VE ASKED HIM TO JOIN ME ON PART OF MY JOURNEY
###2438 TO RETURN TO WHERE HE LIVED DURING THE HOLOCAUST.
###2441 SO HAVE YOU TALKED TO MOM ABOUT OUR TRIP TO CZERNOWITZ?
###2441 YES.
###2444 SHE IS VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT. SHE ENCOURAGES ME TO GO.
###2447 YOU KNOW, MOM IS ALWAYS SOMEONE IN BELIEVING--
###2450 SHE BELIEVES THAT THE PAST HAS TO BE PRESERVED AND REMEMBERED,
###2455 AND SHE HAS HELPED ME OVERCOME MY NATURAL RELUCTANCE TO GO.
###2462 YOU KNOW, WHEN I TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD TO WORK ON YOU,
###2465 SHE SAID SHE NEVER WORKS ON YOU. HA HA!
###2468 BUT I KNEW I HAD AN ALLY.
###2470 IN A VERY SUBTLE WAY, YOU KNOW, SHE WORKS ON ME.
###2474 ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO ENVISION
###2476 WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF HITLER HAD WON THE WAR.
###2480 THERE WOULD BE MASS GRAVES EVERYWHERE, VAST CONCENTRATION CAMPS,
###2483 AND WHAT I CALL IN GREEK A NECROPOLIS, A CITY OF DEATH.
###2487 AND EVEN GERMANY ITSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED,
###2491 BUT MOST GERMANS UNDERSTAND THIS,
###2493 THAT HITLER WOULD HAVE DONE TO GERMANY THINGS
###2495 WHICH EVEN THE WORST ENEMY OF GERMANY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE.
###2498 HE WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES, DESTROYED THE CHURCHES,
###2502 KILLED THE INSANE, AND ABOVE ALL, AND THIS IS THE IMPORTANT POINT,
###2506 HE WOULD HAVE CONVERTED THE YOUNGER GENERATION INTO A RACE OF BARBARIANS.
###2528 Goldhagen: THERE IS A WIDELY HELD MISCONCEPTION
###2532 THAT THE GERMANS' EFFICIENCY AND TECHNOLOGY--
###2535 THE TRAINS AND THE GAS CHAMBERS--
###2537 MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO KILL SO MANY SO QUICKLY.
###2541 AS WE'VE SEEN IN RWANDA AND ELSEWHERE,
###2544 LEADERS DO NOT NEED SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY TO KILL ON A VAST SCALE.
###2548 [MEN SHOUTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###2550 IT IS THE WILL, AND NOT THE WAY,
###2554 THAT IS CRITICAL.
###2556 [MEN SINGING]
###2557 IN RWANDA, THE HUTU LEADERS DID WHAT ALL GENOCIDAL LEADERS DO.
###2562 THEY TAPPED INTO THE PREJUDICES AND BELIEFS THAT PEOPLE ALREADY HELD.
###2567 GENERATIONS OF HUTU HAD GROWN UP BEING TAUGHT
###2570 THAT THE TUTSI ARE DANGEROUS AND INHUMAN.
###2598 [RADIO STATIC]
###2600 [MAN SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###2623 [MEN SINGING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###2629 Goldhagen: IT WAS EASY TO MOBILIZE HUTU FOR THE KILLING.
###2688 [MAN SHOUTS IN BOSNIAN]
###2695 Silajdzic: IN BOSNIA, THERE WAS DELIBERATELY A PARANOID CULTURE
###2700 CREATED PRIOR TO THE WAR,
###2703 ABOUT 5 OR 6, 7 YEARS.
###2706 THERE WAS A PROPAGANDA OF...
###2712 THE SERBS BEING THREATENED BY EVERYBODY ELSE.
###2715 AND I KNOW PEOPLE WHO, BECAUSE OF THIS PROPAGANDA,
###2719 GOOD PEOPLE, WHO GENUINELY BELIEVED
###2721 THAT THEY ARE SOMEHOW THREATENED, SO THEY HAVE TO ATTACK
###2725 IN ORDER TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.
###2727 [CROWD CHANTS]
###2730 Goldhagen: AS HUTU LEADERS DID IN RWANDA,
###2732 THE SERB LEADER, SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC,
###2735 PLAYED ON BELIEFS HIS FOLLOWERS ALREADY HELD.
###2738 HIS RALLYING CRY WAS ONE THAT MOST SERBS WOULD EASILY EMBRACE:
###2742 UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, SERBS WOULD RECLAIM THE LAND
###2745 THAT THEY BELIEVED WERE HISTORICALLY THEIRS,
###2747 INCLUDING THE PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM COUNTRY OF BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA.
###2752 HE EXPLOITED CENTURIES-OLD ANIMOSITIES TOWARD MUSLIMS,
###2756 WHOM THE CHRISTIAN SERBS SAW AS THEIR ETERNAL ENEMIES.
###2759 WHAT THEY'RE BEING TOLD ABOUT BOSNIA'S--
###2762 ABOUT MUSLIMS, THEY ARE A THREAT TO THEM.
###2765 WHY DOES THIS MAKE SENSE TO THEM?
###2767 BECAUSE IT'S IN HARMONY WITH THE NATIONALIST MYTH
###2770 THAT MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN FED FOR GENERATIONS,
###2774 AND THE LABELINGS OF THE VICTIMS
###2777 THAT THEY VIOLATED DURING THIS ACTIVITY FIT THAT MYTH.
###2784 [CROWD CHANTING]
###2787 Goldhagen: WHEN THOSE HARBORING POWERFUL HATREDS FINALLY ARE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO KILL,
###2792 THEIR EUPHORIA IS UNMISTAKABLE.
###2803 [WHISTLE BLOWING]
###2843 Goldhagen: IN BOSNIA, THE SERBS' PLAN WAS COMPREHENSIVE.
###2847 IT WAS DESCRIBED WIDELY AS ETHNIC CLEANSING,
###2850 A EUPHEMISM THAT TRIVIALIZES THEIR BRUTAL ACTS.
###2854 THEY ROUNDED UP MUSLIM MEN
###2856 AND PUT THEM IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS OR MURDERED THEM OUTRIGHT.
###2862 THEY EXPELLED FAMILIES FROM THEIR HOMES
###2864 AND FROM REGIONS WHICH THEY WANTED EXCLUSIVELY FOR SERBS.
###2876 AND IN THE CAPITAL CITY, SARAJEVO,
###2879 THEY ATTACKED THE CIVILIAN POPULATION FROM THE SURROUNDING HILLS.
###2887 [GUNFIRE]
###2888 [EXPLOSION]
###2890 [SIREN]
###2892 Man: THE BOSNIAN SERBS FIRED 12 MORTAR AND ARTILLERY ROUNDS LAST NIGHT
###2896 INTO A PART OF THE CITY CROWDED WITH YOUNG PEOPLE.
###2899 [GUNFIRE]
###2900 Sudetic: THE SNIPING ACTIVITY HERE WAS NOTORIOUS.
###2903 PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THE STREET WERE HUNTED LIKE ANIMALS.
###2906 SO WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO US IF WE HAD BEEN HERE?
###2908 WE WOULD HAVE BEEN SHOT FROM THOSE BUILDINGS OVER THERE.
###2910 THAT FAR AWAY? I MEAN, THE ROOF--
###2910 NO, THAT'S NOT FAR AT ALL.
###2912 I MEAN, A SNIPER COULD HAVE HIT US RIGHT HERE?
###2914 OH, YEAH, YEAH. DEFINITELY.
###2916 IT'S NOT A HARD SHOT FROM--
###2919 FOR A TRAINED SNIPER.
###2921 AND THESE WERE TRAINED PEOPLE. THEY WERE NOT, UH,
###2923 THEY WERE NOT YAHOOS WITH 12-GAUGES.
###2925 [GUNSHOT]
###2927 THESE WERE HIGH-POWERED HUNTING RIFLES.
###2929 THEY USED HIGH-POWERED SNIPER RIFLES
###2931 WITH VERY SOPHISTICATED SIGHT EQUIPMENT ON THEM.
###2935 AND IT'S--
###2935 YOU'D BE BANGED WITH A HEAD SHOT.
###2938 [GUNSHOT]
###2939 YOU COULD WALK ACROSS THIS STREET
###2941 IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AND NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN, BUT THEN--
###2944 [MACHINE GUNFIRE]
###2947 LIKE BAGGING PREY.
###2949 WERE THEY JUST AS LIKELY TO SHOOT WOMEN?
###2950 YES.
###2950 AND CHILDREN?
###2950 YEAH.
###2952 SO IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU BEING A SOLDIER, PER SE.
###2952 NO.
###2954 SO WHAT WAS-- I MEAN, WHAT WAS THE FUNCTION?
###2956 I MEAN, WHY WERE THEY
###2956 DOING THIS? TERROR.
###2958 [EXPLOSION, GUNFIRE]
###2961 GET RID OF THE MUSLIMS.
###2961 YEAH.
###2963 AND SO TERRORIZE THEM,
###2965 KILL AS MANY AS POSSIBLE--
###2965 YES.
###2967 PUSH AS MANY OF THEM INTO AS SMALL AN AREA AS POSSIBLE SO THEY COULD TAKE THE REST.
###2971 THEY KNEW EVERYTHING. THEY PREPARE EVERYTHING.
###2974 IT WAS REALLY ACTUALLY PLANNED AND SYSTEMATIC.
###2977 ACTUALLY SYSTEMATICALLY PLANNED, THE WAR,
###2980 OF ACTUALLY ESTABLISHING CONCENTRATION CAMPS,
###2984 KILLING, RAPING, EVERYTHING.
###2988 RAPING'S ONE OF THE WORST CRIMES.
###2991 IT NOT ONLY HUMILIATES THE PERSON,
###2995 IT DESTROYS THE FAMILY.
###2995 MM-HMM.
###2997 THERE IS SO MANY CASES OF UNWANTED CHILDREN.
###3001 THE MOTHER DOESN'T RECOGNIZE HER SON OR DAUGHTER
###3005 THAT CAME FROM THESE RAPINGS.
###3008 Goldhagen: THE SERBS' WIDESPREAD RAPING OF BOSNIAN WOMEN
###3012 WAS NOT THE KIND OF THING, AS MANY THINK,
###3014 THAT HAPPENS INEVITABLY IN WAR ZONES.
###3016 Muratcaus: THEY DID NOTHING, ACTUALLY...
###3020 Goldhagen, voice-over: LIKE KILLING,
###3022 THE SERBS USE RAPE AND RAPE CAMPS AS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT
###3026 OF THEIR CAMPAIGN TO RID THE COUNTRY OF ITS MUSLIM POPULATION.
###3029 Muratcaus: WE WILL NEVER FIND OUT HOW MANY WOMEN WERE RAPED
###3034 ALL OVER BOSNIA.
###3037 THEY ACTUALLY POSED US
###3040 IN SOME BIG ROOMS WITH MAYBE 14 BEDS.
###3044 THEY ARE YELLING AT US, "YOU WILL HAVE SERBIAN BABIES, SERBIAN CHILDREN."
###3050 THEY WERE BEATEN,
###3052 HORRIBLY BEATEN
###3054 WITH FACE, WITH, ACTUALLY, THEIR LEGS AND...
###3059 HORRIBLE.
###3062 [COMPUTER KEYBOARD KEYS TAPPING]
###3067 THERE'S A LOT TO MAKE SENSE OF HERE.
###3070 IT SEEMS TO ME WE'VE BEEN MISSING A CRITICAL POINT
###3073 IN UNDERSTANDING THESE HORRORS.
###3075 THE MASTERMINDS OF GENOCIDE USE DIFFERENT MEANS
###3079 IN VARYING COMBINATIONS TO GET RID OF UNWANTED PEOPLE.
###3084 THEY EXPEL VICTIMS FROM THEIR COUNTRIES,
###3087 THEY HERD THEM INTO CAMPS,
###3088 THEY RAPE WOMEN IN AN ORGANIZED WAY,
###3091 AND OF COURSE, THEY SYSTEMATICALLY SLAUGHTER.
###3096 [COMPUTER KEYBOARD KEYS TAPPING]
###3099 SO WHAT WE OFTEN THINK OF AS GENOCIDE IS NEVER JUST ABOUT KILLING.
###3105 WHAT THE PERPETRATORS WANT MOST OF ALL
###3108 IS TO ELIMINATE A SUBSTANTIAL PART OR ALL OF THE TARGETED GROUP.
###3119 TERMS LIKE "GENOCIDE" OR EVEN "MASS MURDER"
###3122 ARE INADEQUATE TO DESCRIBE THE PHENOMENON WE HAVE REPEATEDLY WITNESSED.
###3129 AS A POLITICAL SCIENTIST, I LIVE AND WORK IN A WORLD OF ISMS.
###3134 THIS ONE WE SHOULD CALL ELIMINATIONISM.
###3139 REFRAMING THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT THESE DEEDS IS NOT JUST AN INTELLECTUAL EXERCISE.
###3146 IT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF UNDERSTANDING
###3148 THAT GENOCIDE IS ONE PART OF A LARGER PHENOMENON THAT WE MUST COMBAT.
###3154 WE NEED TO BE ON ALERT WHEN WE SEE ANY FORM OF ELIMINATIONIST POLITICS,
###3159 WHETHER IT INITIALLY INCLUDES KILLING OR NOT.
###3165 EVERYWHERE IT IS PRACTICED, ELIMINATIONISM TAKES DIFFERENT FORMS.
###3170 RWANDA WAS DIFFERENT FROM BOSNIA,
###3172 CAMBODIA WAS DIFFERENT FROM TURKEY.
###3177 THE GERMANS' ASSAULT ON THE JEWS WAS ALSO DIFFERENT.
###3184 IT WAS THE ONLY CASE WHEN PERPETRATORS TARGETED EVERY ADULT AND CHILD,
###3189 WITHOUT EXCEPTION, FOR ANNIHILATION,
###3192 AND WHERE THAT MURDEROUS POLICY EXTENDED TO COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY,
###3197 INCLUDING JEWS HALF A CONTINENT AWAY.
###3201 Goldhagen: SO IT'S 64 YEARS SINCE YOU'VE BEEN BACK, RIGHT?
###3204 YES, THAT'S RIGHT, YES.
###3204 AND--
###3206 AND I FEEL THE SADNESS AS I COME BACK
###3208 TO THIS PLACE WHERE I WAS ALMOST KILLED,
###3211 WHERE A GREAT PART OF MY FAMILY LIES BURIED.
###3214 HAD YOU--HAD YOU EVER--
###3218 HAD YOU PLANNED ONE DAY TO COME BACK ON YOUR OWN?
###3220 NO, NEVER. REALLY NOT.
###3223 UH, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE NEVER COME BACK
###3225 HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT YOU WERE MAKING THIS FILM.
###3229 SO ARE YOU A RELUCTANT, IF WILLING, PARTICIPANT?
###3233 AN AMBIVALENT PARTICIPANT, I WOULD SAY.
###3243 Goldhagen: THE JEWS IN THE REGION WHERE MY FATHER LIVED
###3246 WERE KILLED, IN MOST CASES, BY THE EINSATZGRUPPEN--
###3249 MOBILE KILLING SQUADS CHARGED WITH EXTERMINATING EVERY JEW
###3253 IN THE SOVIET TERRITORY CONQUERED BY THE GERMANS.
###3256 THEY KILLED WITH BRUTAL ABANDON.
###3270 Goldhagen: IS THERE ANY-- IS THERE A POSITIVE SIDE FOR YOU TO GO BACK?
###3273 SHOWING ME THE PLACES YOU WERE--
###3276 YES, SHOWING YOU THE PLACES
###3278 BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN SORT OF AN ACADEMIC,
###3282 VERY SECLUDED,
###3285 NEVER...
###3288 FOR THE FIRST TIME-- YOU HAVE STUDIED
###3292 THIS PHENOMENON FROM A DISTANCE, THROUGH DOCUMENT.
###3296 COME NOW, YOU HAVE SEEN THE MASS GRAVES IN GUATEMALA.
###3306 AND YOU CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE MASS GRAVE
###3309 OF SOME OF YOUR RELATIVES, GRAVE OF MY PARENTS.
###3317 Goldhagen: THERE WERE 2,000 JEWS IN THIS TOWN WHEN MY FATHER USED TO VISIT HIS RELATIVES HERE.
###3323 NOW THERE ARE 3.
###3327 MOST LIE IN A MASS GRAVE NEAR WHAT IS NOW A POPULAR PICNIC SITE.
###3332 [BOYS SHOUTING]
###3339 [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###3341 Goldhagen: LIKE MY FATHER, I HAVE ALWAYS ENDEAVORED TO SEPARATE MY EMOTIONS
###3345 FROM MY SCHOLARLY WORK ON GENOCIDE.
###3348 BUT HERE WE ARE, AT A MOMENT THAT I NEVER IMAGINED.
###3352 A LOCAL MAN HAS AGREED TO GUIDE US TO THE SITE
###3356 WHERE GERMANS MURDERED MY FATHER'S RELATIVES AND 2,000 OTHERS.
###3360 I SEE, I SEE.
###3361 OH, HERE WE CAN GO CLOSE.
###3373 Goldhagen: THE SCHOLAR'S JOB IS TO STAND BACK AND ANALYZE,
###3377 BUT THE SURVIVOR AND THE SON HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DRAW NEAR.
###3381 "TO THE ETERNAL MEMORY
###3383 OF THE JEWS OF KOSOV..."
###3387 "WHO WERE MURDERED
###3390 "BY THE NAZI MURDERERS
###3394 AND THEIR HELPERS."
###3398 SO...
###3399 HOW MANY...PEOPLE FROM YOUR FAMILY
###3402 ARE LYING IN THIS MASS GRAVE--
###3405 I WOULD ESTIMATE IT OVER A DOZEN PEOPLE.
###3408 WERE YOU CLOSE TO THEM?
###3410 I WAS VERY CLOSE TO THEM. I VISITED THEM HERE,
###3412 AND IT EVOKES SOME CERTAIN EMOTIONS.
###3415 THE IMAGES OF SOME, OF ELDERS APPEAR BEFORE ME.
###3419 I SEE THEM NOW. AS I SPEAK TO YOU NOW, I SEE THEM.
###3423 SOMETIMES--AS YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN I GAVE THE COURSE
###3427 ON THE HOLOCAUST AT HARVARD--
###3430 I EXPERIENCE SOMETIMES A SENSE OF GUILT
###3433 AT THE FACT THAT I SPEAK SO COOLLY
###3436 AND ANALYTICALLY OVER THEIR DEATH.
###3438 I'M YOUR SON IN MANY WAYS,
###3441 AND YOUR DISPASSION IS MY OWN.
###3444 HOW--HOW DID THEY DIE?
###3446 WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
###3447 WELL, THEY BROUGHT THEM UP HERE
###3450 AND KILLED THEM BY GUNFIRE.
###3451 ONE GROUP FELL INTO THE GRAVE.
###3453 THEN ANOTHER GROUP WAS LINED UP,
###3454 THEY FELL INTO THE GRAVE.
###3456 WHEN THEY WERE SHOT?
###3456 WHEN THEY WERE SHOT
###3457 UNTIL--AND MANY OF THEM WERE PROBABLY NOT KILLED,
###3460 MANY OF THEM WERE PROBABLY NOT DEAD.
###3461 THEY WERE ALIVE AS THEY FELL INTO THE GRAVE,
###3464 AND UKRAINIAN GROUPS WERE MADE TO COVER THE GRAVES.
###3470 YOU KNOW, AS WE'VE OFTEN SPOKEN BEFORE,
###3471 IT'S SHOCKING TO ME TO REFLECT ON HOW DETACHED I AM, TOO,
###3475 FROM THIS, THAT I DIDN'T EVEN MAKE
###3477 THIS OBVIOUS CONNECTION THAT WE WERE GOING HERE
###3480 WHEN I WAS IN A MASS GRAVE IN GUATEMALA,
###3482 BUT NOW THAT WE'RE HERE,
###3484 I REALIZE THAT SUDDENLY MY RELATIVES
###3487 MURDERED SIT BELOW US, LIE BELOW US
###3490 UNMARKED, UNKNOWN,
###3495 BARELY REGISTERED IN ANY WAY,
###3496 THEIR NAMES ABSENT, SOON TO BE FORGOTTEN COMPLETELY.
###3501 SHOULD WE GET SOME STONES, TATI?
###3514 PERHAPS WE BETTER PUT THEM ON EACH.
###3550 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]
###3559 [DRUMS BEATING]
###3561 [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###3572 Woman: WELL, CERTAINLY, WE THOUGHT THAT WE WERE SAYING,
###3575 "NEVER AGAIN," BUT WE KEEP SAYING, "NEVER AGAIN,"
###3578 OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
###3580 WELL, THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES.
###3581 WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING AGAIN,
###3583 AND WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY DO ANYTHING
###3585 TO STOP IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?
###3586 AND IT KEEPS HAPPENING BECAUSE
###3588 THERE ARE POLITICAL REGIMES THAT FIND IT USEFUL
###3590 TO DEAL WITH THEIR SELF-DEFINED PROBLEMS,
###3593 AND IT'S A VERY USEFUL TOOL.
###3595 THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY HAVE BASICALLY IMPUNITY,
###3598 AND THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE CALLING TO ACCOUNT,
###3601 AND THEY GET AWAY WITH IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN.
###3603 SO QUITE CLEARLY, THE STATUS QUO IS CATASTROPHIC,
###3606 AND WHEN I SAY CATASTROPHIC,
###3607 I MEAN LITERALLY CATASTROPHIC
###3609 BECAUSE IT TAKES THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS,
###3611 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS,
###3612 MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE,
###3615 AND SO "NEVER AGAIN" IS A HOLLOW PHRASE.
###3617 IT'S WELL-MEANT, BUT IN THE WORLD
###3619 OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS,
###3620 IT'S BEEN A HOLLOW PHRASE, A MOCKERY OF ITSELF.
###3626 THE INACTION OF WORLD LEADERS IN THE FACE OF MASS SLAUGHTER
###3630 GOES BACK WELL BEFORE THE HOLOCAUST,
###3633 AND GENOCIDAL LEADERS HAVE TAKEN NOTE.
###3637 STARTING IN 1915, THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT KILLED
###3640 AT LEAST A MILLION ARMENIANS
###3642 AND EXPELLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE.
###3646 THE STORY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE
###3648 WAS COVERED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES,"
###3652 AND TURKEY'S LEADERS WERE EXPLICITLY WARNED
###3654 BY THE U.S. AND OTHERS THAT THEIR NATION
###3656 WOULD BE CONDEMNED BY THE WORLD,
###3660 BUT THE MASTERMINDS OF GENOCIDE WERE UNDETERRED.
###3665 THE TURKS BRAZENLY DESTROYED COMMUNITIES,
###3668 KILLED, RAPED, AND DROVE THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE
###3671 INTO THE DESERT, WHERE THEY STARVED TO DEATH.
###3677 FOR A CENTURY, TURKEY HAS REFUSED
###3679 TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GENOCIDE,
###3682 AND REMARKABLY, MANY AROUND THE WORLD,
###3684 INCLUDING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO DO SO.
###3689 Man: THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE
###3690 IS THE ONLY GENOCIDE THAT WE HAVE TROUBLE RECOGNIZING,
###3694 AND IT'S BECAUSE THE CAMPAIGN OF DENIAL
###3697 CONTINUES TO THIS DAY.
###3698 Woman: OUR GOVERNMENT IS FLAT OUT WRONG
###3701 IN THEIR REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE.
###3704 WE MUST CALL GENOCIDE BY ITS NAME.
###3709 Schiff: WE CAN'T HAVE THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP
###3711 THAT WE NEED IN STOPPING GENOCIDE GOING ON TODAY
###3714 IF WE'RE EQUIVOCAL ABOUT THE MURDER OF OTHER PEOPLE
###3718 BECAUSE IT MIGHT OFFEND AN ALLY.
###3722 I SHOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A NO-BRAINER
###3724 THAT A RESOLUTION BE PASSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS.
###3726 WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
###3727 WELL, IT SHOULD BE A NO-BRAINER.
###3729 AS IT IS, IT'S AN ENORMOUSLY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE.
###3732 WHEN THE GENOCIDE RESOLUTION WAS IN COMMITTEE LAST FALL,
###3736 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
###3738 WAS ON THE PHONE, CALLING COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THEIR HOME
###3741 TO URGE THEM TO VOTE AGAINST IT.
###3742 FOR THIS RESOLUTION?
###3742 FOR THIS RESOLUTION.
###3744 WE ALL DEEPLY REGRET THE TRAGIC SUFFERING OF THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE
###3747 THAT BEGAN IN 1915.
###3751 THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT THE RIGHT RESPONSE
###3753 TO THESE HISTORIC MASS KILLINGS.
###3755 THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE
###3756 IS THAT THIS IS CLEARLY
###3757 A VERY SENSITIVE SUBJECT
###3759 FOR ONE OF OUR CLOSEST ALLIES.
###3760 YOU HAD MEMBERS OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF CALLING MEMBERS,
###3763 YOU HAD THE SECRETARY OF STATE CALLING MEMBERS.
###3766 I'VE NEVER SEEN A FULL-COURT PRESS LIKE THIS ON ANY RESOLUTION.
###3770 I DON'T THINK WE STRENGTHEN OUR RELATIONSHIP
###3772 EVEN WITH AN ALLY WHEN WE TURN A BLIND EYE
###3774 TO SOME OF THE WORST CHAPTERS IN HUMAN HISTORY.
###3778 Goldhagen: OUR POLITICIANS MAY FAIL TO LEARN FROM HISTORY,
###3782 BUT THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT MASS MURDERERS
###3784 HAVE LEARNED QUITE WELL.
###3786 Man: SUDANESE PRESIDENT OMAR AL-BASHIR
###3788 HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF MASTERMINDING
###3789 A CAMPAIGN OF GENOCIDE IN DARFUR.
###3792 Goldhagen: 20 YEARS BEFORE THE RECENT CRISIS IN DARFUR,
###3795 THE SAME SUDANESE GOVERNMENT KILLED AND EXPELLED
###3798 EVEN MORE PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN SUDAN.
###3805 AFTER KILLING TWO MILLION THEN,
###3807 THE SUDANESE LEADER OMAR AL-BASHIR LEARNED
###3810 THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WOULD LET HIM DO IT AGAIN.
###3816 WHY DOES THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FAIL TO INTERVENE TIME AND TIME AGAIN?
###3830 JUST TELL ME.
###3834 Madeleine Albright: AS OUR REPORT EMPHASIZES,
###3835 THE CHOICE WE FACE IN TRYING TO PREVENT GENOCIDE
###3838 IS RARELY A CASE OF ALL OR NOTHING.
###3842 THERE IS A BROAD RANGE OF FOREIGN POLICY OPTIONS
###3845 BETWEEN STANDING ASIDE AND ORDERING IN THE MARINES.
###3849 Goldhagen: THE CO-CHAIR OF A RECENT TASK FORCE ON THE SUBJECT,
###3852 FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT
###3855 SERVED AS U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS
###3858 DURING THE BOSNIAN AND RWANDAN GENOCIDES.
###3860 [ELEVATOR PINGING]
###3872 Goldhagen: YOU KNOW, IF ONE IS SIMPLY NAIVE,
###3874 ONE SEES A WORLD OF POWERFUL COUNTRIES USUALLY LOOKING ON
###3879 WITH SOME INEPTITUDE AT BEST AT COUNTRIES
###3882 THAT ARE POOR AND NOT VERY POWERFUL
###3884 IN WHICH THEIR LEADERSHIP IS SLAUGHTERING PEOPLE,
###3887 AND YOU WONDER HOW CAN THIS BE?
###3889 IF YOU GO TO PEOPLE AND YOU SAY,
###3891 "YOU CAN PREVENT MASS MURDER,"
###3893 THEN MOST PEOPLE WILL THINK,
###3895 "OK. I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN."
###3897 THE PROBLEM IS THAT WORLD LEADERS
###3900 OR LEADERS GENERALLY ARE DISTRACTED.
###3902 THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO.
###3903 IT ISN'T AS IF THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.
###3905 THERE'S NO WAY TO DESCRIBE TO SOMEONE
###3907 THAT HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
###3910 OR ANY GOVERNMENT HOW MANY THINGS ARE HAPPENING EVERY HOUR
###3914 AND REQUIRE ATTENTION AND REQUIRE WILL AND REQUIRE RESOURCES.
###3918 THE QUESTION IS WHETHER YOUR GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM
###3922 IS SET UP IN A WAY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH.
###3927 WE CAN TALK ABOUT RWANDA,
###3928 WHERE THERE WERE MANY DIFFERENT PLAYERS INVOLVED
###3931 AND PEOPLE HAD DIFFERENT DEGREES OF KNOWLEDGE
###3933 AT DIFFERENT TIMES ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.
###3935 IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS A CLEAR LACK OF WILL--
###3937 NOT GOODWILL IN THE SENSE OF COURSE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT
###3939 THE PEOPLE THERE TO BE SLAUGHTERED,
###3941 BUT WILL ACTUALLY TO TAKE THE SACRIFICE
###3944 OR MAKE THE SACRIFICE THAT WAS NECESSARY
###3945 SEE, I DISAGREE WITH YOU.
###3946 THE BELGIANS PULLED OUT, DALLAIRE WAS-- YOU KNOW THE STORY.
###3950 DALLAIRE WAS CRYING OUT FOR MORE SUPPORT.
###3954 MAYBE NOT EVERYONE COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED,
###3957 BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED.
###3958 I MEAN, THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WEIGHS VERY HEAVY
###3960 ON ALL OUR HEARTS.
###3962 WE WERE AT THE SAME TIME DEALING
###3963 WITH SOMALIA, BOSNIA, HAITI,
###3966 A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT WERE GOING ON,
###3968 AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE DID NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND
###3972 ALL THE HUTU-TUTSI RIVALRY
###3975 AND THE INTERNAL THINGS THAT WERE BUILDING UP.
###3977 THAT, I THINK, WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD NOT BEEN PAID
###3980 ENOUGH ATTENTION TO.
###3981 IT IS MUCH EASIER EX POST FACTO
###3984 TO SAY WE KNEW THESE KINDS OF THINGS WERE GOING ON,
###3987 BUT AT THE TIME I WAS AMBASSADOR AT THE UNITED NATIONS,
###3990 AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE INFORMATION WAS NOT THERE.
###3996 Goldhagen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION ALBRIGHT NEEDED,
###3999 BUT EVEN MORE THAN DURING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE,
###4002 INFORMATION ABOUT THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE
###4004 WAS AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WITH ACCESS TO TV OR NEWSPAPER,
###4008 AS THERE WERE MULTIPLE SOURCES OF INFORMATION
###4010 COMING STRAIGHT FROM RWANDA,
###4012 WHERE EVERYONE KNEW.
###4016 AS SOON AS THE KILLING BEGAN, MANY TUTSI,
###4019 INCLUDING EMMANUEL GATARI,
###4021 MADE THEIR WAY TO A TECHNICAL SCHOOL,
###4023 WHICH WAS BEING PROTECTED BY U.N. PEACEKEEPERS.
###4074 AS THE LIVES OF EMMANUEL AND THE OTHERS WITH HIM HUNG IN THE BALANCE,
###4078 THE U.S. AND OTHER FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS
###4080 BEGAN TO EVACUATE THEIR CITIZENS FROM RWANDA.
###4105 [EMMANUEL SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###4128 [MACHINEGUNS FIRING]
###4132 Karugarama: AND THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE HAD RUN TO THE U.N.
###4136 FOR SECURITY, FOR PROTECTION,
###4140 AND THEY WITHDREW AND LEFT THEM THERE
###4142 TO BE MASSACRED IN COLD BLOOD.
###4153 THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT THE U.N.
###4158 SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN.
###4160 HOW DO YOU WITHDRAW PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT PEOPLE
###4164 AT A TIME THAT IS SO CRITICAL,
###4167 AT A TIME WHEN YOU SEE THE KILLINGS HAD ALREADY STARTED?
###4253 Goldhagen: A LACK OF INFORMATION IS NOT THE REASON
###4256 WORLD LEADERS FAIL TO INTERVENE TO STOP GENOCIDES.
###4259 THE PROBLEM IS A LACK OF WILL.
###4265 FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY, PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
###4269 HAVE EXPECTED THE MEN AND WOMEN HERE AT THE UNITED NATIONS
###4272 TO PROTECT THEM,
###4275 AND TIME AND AGAIN, THE U.N. HAS LET THOSE PEOPLE DOWN.
###4280 I LOOK AROUND AT THE MANY STATES HERE THAT HAVE TERRORIZED,
###4283 OPPRESSED, AND ELIMINATED THEIR OWN PEOPLE,
###4286 AND I THINK, "WHY WOULD ANYONE LOOK TO THIS BODY
###4290 TO COMBAT THESE EVILS AROUND THE WORLD?"
###4296 IN 1948, THE UNITED NATIONS ADOPTED
###4299 AN ANTIGENOCIDE CONVENTION THAT LEGALLY DEFINED GENOCIDE
###4302 AND AUTHORIZED ITS MEMBER STATES
###4305 TO STOP AND PUNISH ACTS OF MASS MURDER.
###4309 THE DOCUMENT IS NOBLE-SOUNDING BUT TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE.
###4313 IT HAS NEVER ONCE BEEN INVOKED TO PREVENT THE DEATH
###4315 OF A SINGLE PERSON.
###4320 THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM HERE.
###4322 THE U.N. EXISTS LARGELY TO PROTECT STATE SOVEREIGNTY,
###4326 A STATE'S RIGHT TO BE IMMUNE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES
###4328 INTERVENING IN ITS INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
###4331 SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT TO ALSO PROMOTE INTERVENTION
###4335 WHEN A SOVEREIGN STATE AND ITS PEOPLE
###4336 ARE ELIMINATING, KILLING, RAPING, AND EXPELLING GROUPS OF ITS OWN CITIZENS?
###4342 Man: I DON'T SEE SOVEREIGNTY NEGATIVELY
###4344 AS A CONCEPT OF BARRICADING YOURSELF AGAINST THE WORLD
###4347 WHILE YOUR PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING.
###4348 I SEE IT AS A POSITIVE CONCEPT
###4351 OF THE STATE DISCHARGING ITS RESPONSIBILITIES
###4354 TOWARDS ITS OWN CITIZENS,
###4356 PROVIDING THEM WITH PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE,
###4359 AND IF FOR LACK OF CAPACITY, YOU CANNOT DO IT,
###4362 CALL ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COME AND HELP YOU
###4365 DO WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE FIRST PLACE.
###4367 YOU KNOW, I APPLAUD WHAT YOU DO, AND I AGREE,
###4371 AND I ALSO VERY MUCH LIKE
###4373 RECONCEPTUALIZING CONCEPTS THE WAY YOU HAVE
###4375 WITH SOVEREIGNTY, BUT YOU'RE
###4377 IN A MINORITY THERE, AS YOU WELL KNOW...
###4379 ABSOLUTELY.
###4380 AND EVEN IN THIS HALL IN PARTICULAR,
###4382 YOU WOULD BE IN A MINORITY
###4383 IF YOU WERE TO STAND UP AND TO GIVE AND SPEECH HERE,
###4386 AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOVEREIGNTY
###4389 IS AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE,
###4391 BUT WE SHOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT IT DOES NOT GO SO FAR
###4395 AS TO ALLOW GOVERNMENTS TO SLAUGHTER THEIR PEOPLE
###4398 AND THAT THAT IN ITSELF, THOSE ACTS IN ITSELF ABRIDGE SOVEREIGNTY.
###4402 AND IF YOU DO NOT DISCHARGE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
###4405 AND YOU DON'T WELCOME HELP, YOU HAVE NO WILL,
###4408 WE WILL TAKE OTHER MEASURES.
###4410 AND THESE OTHER MEASURES WE NEED TO DEVELOP TO BE A CREDIBLE THREAT,
###4415 BUT MEANWHILE, I'M JUST DOING WHAT IS IN MY CAPACITY TO DO.
###4419 AND YOU'RE DOING IT WELL.
###4421 Goldhagen, voice-over: THERE ARE WELL-MEANING PEOPLE HERE TO BE SURE,
###4424 BUT I'M AFRAID THEY'RE PART OF AN INSTITUTION
###4426 THAT IS SET UP TO FAIL.
###4429 THE U.N. IS NOT THE SOLUTION,
###4431 AS ITS APPALLING RECORD SHOWS,
###4433 BUT I DO THINK WE CAN DESIGN A SYSTEM
###4435 THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY STOP OR PREVENT FUTURE GENOCIDES.
###4440 THE FIRST COMPONENT MUST BE SWIFT DIPLOMATIC INTERVENTION.
###4445 A RECENT EPISODE HERE IN KENYA MAY OFFER A PROMISING MODEL FOR THE FUTURE.
###4449 Man: WHAT WAS ONCE ONE OF AFRICA'S MOST STABLE DEMOCRACIES
###4452 IS RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT PLACES IN THE WORLD.
###4455 EXTREME CHAOS FOLLOWING A DISPUTED ELECTION IN KENYA,
###4459 MOBS TORCHING A CHURCH WITH HUNDREDS
###4461 OF REFUGEES INSIDE.
###4462 WITNESSES SAY DOZENS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING CHILDREN,
###4465 WERE BURNED ALIVE OR HACKED TO DEATH WITH MACHETES,
###4468 AND THERE ARE NEW FEARS TODAY THAT KENYA IS IN DANGER
###4471 OF BECOMING THE NEXT RWANDA.
###4477 Goldhagen: IN JANUARY 2008, A SPATE OF KILLINGS
###4480 FOLLOWED THE REELECTION OF KENYAN PRESIDENT MWAI KIBAKI.
###4484 Man: CLEARLY, I THINK, THE IMMEDIATE TRIGGER
###4486 FOR THAT VIOLENCE WAS THE DISPUTED ELECTION RESULTS THAT HAPPENED,
###4490 BUT BEYOND THAT, I THINK THERE WERE ALSO
###4492 OTHER UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT CAME TO THE FORE,
###4494 ISSUES OF DISCONTENTMENT, ISSUES OF MARGINALIZATION,
###4497 RIFTS BETWEEN ETHNIC GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY,
###4500 ISSUES OF LAND, ISSUES OF HISTORICAL INJUSTICES.
###4502 SO ALL THESE THINGS CAME UP TOGETHER,
###4504 AND I THINK THAT THE ELECTION RESULTS,
###4506 THE WAY IT WAS HANDLED, THE PROCESS,
###4508 WAS REALLY LIKE THE MATCH THAT WAS THROWN
###4510 INTO A BARREL OF OIL.
###4511 [SINGING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###4514 Goldhagen: IN THE RIFT VALLEY, MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S TRIBE, THE KIKUYU,
###4517 WERE TARGETED.
###4519 1,500 OR MORE WERE KILLED,
###4521 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WERE EXPELLED FROM THEIR HOMES.
###4531 IF THE KIKUYU HAD TRIED TO HOLD THEIR GROUND,
###4534 WOULD THE VIOLENCE HAVE ESCALATED
###4536 TO PRODUCE DEATHS ON A MASSIVE SCALE?
###4538 ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THE KILLINGS
###4540 WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY INCREASED.
###4542 I THINK IT WOULD HAVE DRAWN IN, ALSO, MORE COMMUNITIES.
###4546 Goldhagen: WITHIN DAYS, FORMER U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL KOFI ANNAN HAD FLOWN TO NAIROBI
###4551 ALONG WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES.
###4555 I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL KENYANS
###4560 RESPOND WITH SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING
###4565 AND NOT TRY TO REVENGE.
###4567 Goldhagen: THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE CONDOLEEZZA RICE ARRIVED
###4570 SOON AFTER.
###4572 THEY CAME TO MEDIATE, TO PRESSURE,
###4574 AND WITH THREATS OF SANCTIONS.
###4575 Kiai: I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN IN AFRICA
###4577 SUCH INTENSE INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT ON AN ISSUE,
###4580 AND THAT REALLY HELPED.
###4583 Goldhagen: THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE DIPLOMATIC INTERVENTION
###4585 IN KENYA REMAIN TO BE SEEN.
###4588 THE VIOLENCE STOPPED,
###4589 BUT THE RACISTS AND POLITICAL ROOTS
###4591 OF THE CONFLICT RUN DEEP,
###4593 AND KENYAN POLITICAL LEADERS COULD START UP
###4595 THE VIOLENCE AGAIN,
###4597 BUT THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE OF WORLD LEADERS
###4599 WAS A POWERFUL STATEMENT AND THE KIND OF RAPID REACTION
###4603 THAT COULD SAVE MANY LIVES IN THE FUTURE.
###4609 DIPLOMACY OF COURSE DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK.
###4612 Christiane Amanpour: THE U.N. IS ACCUSING THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT
###4614 OF RESUMING BOMBING RAIDS AGAINST REBELS IN SOUTH DARFUR,
###4618 AND IT ALSO SAYS THAT DISPLACED VILLAGERS LIKE THESE
###4622 ARE STILL BEING ATTACKED BY JANJAWEED MILITIA.
###4627 Goldhagen: WHEN THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT WAS MURDERING
###4628 ITS OWN PEOPLE IN THE WESTERN REGION OF DARFUR,
###4631 WORLD LEADERS SENT ENVOYS TO KHARTOUM.
###4636 BUT THE OIL-RICH REGIME CARES LITTLE ABOUT WORLD OPINION.
###4653 THEY CONTINUE TO KILL,
###4654 AND THE WORLD HAS DONE NOTHING MEANINGFUL TO STOP THEM.
###4661 WE NEED TO STOP PROVING TO POLITICAL LEADERS
###4664 THAT WE WILL STAND BY AS THEY SLAUGHTER THEIR OWN PEOPLE.
###4668 IF DIPLOMACY FAILS, COUNTRIES COMMITTING MASS ELIMINATIONS
###4671 SUCH AS SUDAN HAVE TO BE KICKED OUT OF THE U.N.
###4674 AND ALL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS,
###4677 AND ALL TRADE MUST BE CUT OFF.
###4680 LEADERS THAT CONTINUE TO KILL MUST KNOW THAT WE WILL
###4683 SWIFTLY AND FORCEFULLY DESTROY THEIR MILITARY CAPABILITY.
###4690 Felde: SOME PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT SOME KIND OF RAPID RESPONSE FORCE.
###4693 I WOULD OF COURSE BE FOR INTERVENTION,
###4696 MILITARY INTERVENTION WHEN PEOPLE ARE BEING SLAUGHTERED.
###4699 IT SEEMS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT HAVING SOME KIND OF FORCE
###4701 THAT COULD INTERVENE RAPIDLY AND EFFECTIVELY
###4704 IN MANY OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE IT DOESN'T TAKE
###4706 A GREAT DEAL OF FORCE TO STOP THESE THINGS
###4708 IS AN ABSOLUTE MORAL AND POLITICAL NECESSITY.
###4711 SOME WOULD SAY THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO INTERVENE MILITARILY IN DARFUR
###4716 WHAT ABOUT CONGO?
###4717 CERTAINLY, MORE PEOPLE HAVE DIED THERE
###4718 IN THE PAST 10 YEARS.
###4719 SO PERHAPS THEN YOU'RE SUGGESTING
###4721 WE SHOULD INTERVENE THERE, AS WELL.
###4723 THESE KINDS OF ARGUMENTS I ALSO FIND UNPERSUASIVE.
###4727 IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS NOT
###4729 THE POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD,
###4730 EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE GUARANTOR
###4731 OF MUCH OF ORDER IN THE WORLD.
###4733 IT REMAINS THAT, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
###4735 THAT IF INTERVENING IN DARFUR IS
###4737 THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO SAVE LIVES
###4739 THAT WE SHOULD NOT DO IT BECAUSE WE CAN'T INTERVENE EVERYWHERE.
###4742 I DON'T FIND THE ARGUMENTS AGAIN PERSUASIVE THAT,
###4746 WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T DO SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO EVERYTHING.
###4749 OUR PROBLEM IS THAT WE DO LITTLE OR NOTHING AT ALL.
###4752 Silajdzic: THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST HAVE
###4753 A MECHANISM THAT WILL QUICKLY REACT TO GENOCIDE.
###4759 THERE IS NO WAITING THERE,
###4761 THERE IS NO OTHER CONSIDERATION.
###4763 HUMAN LIFE MUST BE SAVED.
###4765 WE MUST ALL AGREE TO THIS.
###4767 IF THERE IS MASS KILLING SOMEWHERE,
###4769 THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS THE RIGHT
###4772 TO INTERVENE.
###4777 YOU KNOW, WHEN IT BECOMES TOO LATE, IT'S TOO LATE.
###4780 Man: IN MANY INSTANCES, DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS
###4783 ARE GONNA BE UNSUCCESSFUL,
###4784 PARTICULARLY ONCE THE KILLING STARTS.
###4787 THE ONLY WAY YOU ARE GONNA STOP THAT
###4788 IS THROUGH THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE,
###4790 BUT IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT
###4792 TO GET A WIDE CONSORTIUM OF COUNTRIES TO AGREE
###4797 THAT THERE'S AN AUTOMATIC TRIGGER
###4798 FOR MILITARY INTERVENTION.
###4800 IN DARFUR, YOU NEED AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS ON BOARD,
###4804 YOU NEED MIDDLE EASTERN GOVERNMENTS ON BOARD.
###4806 THIS HAS PROVED VERY DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH.
###4807 YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A DIPLOMAT, AND I SAY WHY?
###4811 WHY DO WE NEED THEM ON BOARD?
###4812 I MEAN, YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BEING SLAUGHTERED.
###4817 WHY DO WE NEED TO GET MIDDLE EASTERN GOVERNMENTS
###4820 OR AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS ON BOARD?
###4821 WHY NOT CREATE A NO-FLY ZONE,
###4823 WHY NOT BOMB THEIR MILITARY INSTALLATIONS?
###4826 FORGET ABOUT THE DIPLOMACY FOR A MINUTE.
###4827 WOULD IT BE EFFECTIVE, AND THEN HOW DO WE WEIGH IF IT WOULD BE
###4831 THE MORALITY OF IT VERSUS THE DIPLOMACY OF IT?
###4834 FROM THE MORAL PERSPECTIVE, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
###4837 I MEAN, WE DO HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION.
###4838 IF WE'RE IN A POSITION TO ACT
###4841 AND WE HAVE THE ACTUAL CAPABILITY TO DO SO,
###4844 THEN I THINK WE SHOULD,
###4846 BUT IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE
###4848 NOT ABLE TO GET SUPPORT OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS,
###4851 IT MAY BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.
###4854 Goldhagen: GETTING THE SUPPORT OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS
###4855 SOUNDS GOOD, BUT AS HARIS SILAJDZIC
###4858 EXPERIENCED DURING THE DAYS OF THE BOSNIAN GENOCIDE,
###4861 CONVINCING LEADERS TO INTERVENE MILITARILY
###4863 IS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT.
###4865 WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR YOU TRYING TO MOBILIZE
###4868 THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE POLITICAL LEADERS
###4871 OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, OF THE UNITED STATES,
###4874 THE U.N., AND SO ON TO DO SOMETHING?
###4877 WELL, THAT IS VERY FRUSTRATING, THE POWERLESSNESS,
###4882 VERY FRUSTRATING.
###4883 IT'S HARD TO MOVE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
###4885 TO REALLY DO SOMETHING.
###4887 IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY OF, UH...
###4892 THE LEAST RESISTANCE.
###4895 "LET'S DO THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD, SO LET'S WAIT.
###4900 MAYBE IT WILL GO AWAY."
###4905 Goldhagen: AS WE HAVE SEEN TIME AND AGAIN,
###4907 WHEN WE WAIT TO INTERVENE, PROBLEMS DON'T GO AWAY.
###4911 THEY ONLY GET WORSE.
###4920 THIS IS THE STORY OF ANOTHER MASS MURDER
###4922 THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN.
###4925 BY THE TIME IT DID, THE ELIMINATION OF BOSNIA'S MUSLIMS
###4929 HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR 3 YEARS.
###4931 THE OUTSIDE WORLD KNEW WHAT THE SERBS WERE UP TO,
###4934 WE KNEW WE COULD STOP IT,
###4936 AND DAY AFTER DAY, WE CHOSE NOT TO TAKE EFFECTIVE MEASURES.
###4941 IN 1995, THE CITY OF SREBRENICA,
###4944 DESIGNATED A SAFE HAVEN FOR BOSNIAN MUSLIMS BY THE UNITED NATIONS,
###4948 FELL TO SERB FORCES.
###4951 WITHIN DAYS, THE SERBS KILLED 8,000.
###4956 EACH YEAR, SOME OF THE VICTIMS EXHUMED FROM MASS GRAVES
###4959 ARE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED AND GIVEN A PROPER BURIAL
###4962 ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE MASSACRE.
###4970 AS SREBRENICA FELL, THE MUSLIMS SOUGHT REFUGE
###4973 SEVERAL MILES AWAY AT THIS FACTORY COMPLEX,
###4976 WHICH SERVED AS THE HEADQUARTERS
###4977 OF A SMALL U.N. PEACEKEEPING FORCE.
###4993 Sudetic: YOU HAD 25,000 PEOPLE,
###4995 MANY OF THEM ELDERLY, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN
###5000 GATHERED IN THE YARD AROUND THIS BASE, SEEKING PROTECTION.
###5009 AND I THINK AT THAT TIME THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 300 DUTCH TROOPS THERE,
###5013 FAR, FAR BELOW ANYTHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
###5015 A CREDIBLE DETERRENT TO ANY KIND
###5018 OF MILITARY ACTION ON THE GROUND.
###5037 Goldhagen: AFTER THEY CAPTURED SREBRENICA,
###5039 SERB SOLDIERS UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE NOTORIOUS MASS MURDERER GENERAL RATKO MLADIC ARRIVED
###5045 AT THE U.N. BASE TO DEAL WITH THE MUSLIM REFUGEES.
###5058 [CHILDREN CRYING]
###5060 Sudetic: AFTER A NIGHT OF TERROR,
###5062 THE SERBS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE
###5064 TRANSPORTED TO FRIENDLY LINES IN BUSES, DON'T BE AFRAID.
###5070 THEY BROUGHT COOKIES FOR CHILDREN.
###5073 [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###5081 THE SERBS SEPARATE THE MILITARY AGE MEN.
###5086 WHAT THAT MEANT WAS PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY 12 AND ABOVE TO ONE SIDE,
###5090 AND THEN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND THE OLDER PEOPLE
###5093 TO THE OTHER.
###5201 Goldhagen: THIS IS HOW EASY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
###5202 TO SAVE THE LIVES OF SABAHETA'S SON
###5205 AND 8,000 OTHERS IN SREBRENICA.
###5207 Woman: EARLY MORNING RAIDS OF MORE THAN 60 AIRCRAFT
###5210 FROM AS MANY AS 5 NATIONS POUNDED AIR DEFENSE MISSILES...
###5214 Goldhagen: IN AUGUST 1995, TWO MONTHS AFTER THE EXPULSION
###5217 AND MASS MURDER IN SREBRENICA
###5220 AND 3 YEARS AFTER THE GENOCIDE BEGAN,
###5223 NATO FORCES BEGAN A BOMBING CAMPAIGN
###5226 AGAINST SERBIAN MILITARY TARGETS.
###5228 IN JUST 3 WEEKS, THE BOMBING CHANGED
###5230 MILOSEVIC'S CALCULATIONS.
###5233 IN SHORT ORDER, SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC WAS
###5236 AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE, DISCUSSING THE PEACE TREATY
###5239 THAT WOULD END HIS DEPREDATIONS IN BOSNIA.
###5241 THE BOSNIAN GENOCIDE WAS OVER.
###5244 LET'S TURN THE CLOCK BACK.
###5246 WHAT HAPPENS IF IN 1992 NATO STARTED TO BOMB
###5251 AND NOT WAITED UNTIL 1995 TO DO SO?
###5253 OH, THAT WOULD HAVE STOPPED EVERYTHING DEFINITELY.
###5258 WE WOULD HAVE SAVED THE LIVES OF 100,000 PEOPLE?
###5262 NOT ONLY THAT. THE CREDIBILITY
###5264 OF THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER,
###5266 THE CREDIBILITY OF JUSTICE,
###5269 THE CREDIBILITY OF HUMANITY.
###5272 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED.
###5290 Goldhagen: THE PERPETRATORS OF ELIMINATION
###5292 ALMOST ALWAYS ACT WITH TOTAL IMPUNITY.
###5296 HERE IN GUATEMALA, A GENOCIDAL MASTERMIND WALKS FREELY.
###5302 IN FACT, HE CONTINUES TO SERVE IN THE COUNTRY'S CONGRESS.
###5308 [SPEAKS SPANISH]
###5311 Goldhagen, voice-over: AT THE TIME THIS KILLER COMMITTED HIS CRIMES,
###5314 HE BELIEVED HE WOULD GET AWAY WITH MURDER.
###5316 SO FAR, HE'S BEEN PROVEN RIGHT.
###5337 JOSÉ EFRAÍN RÍOS MONTT LED THIS COUNTRY
###5339 FOR NEARLY TWO TERRIFYING YEARS,
###5342 DURING WHICH HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A WIDESPREAD CAMPAIGN
###5345 OF TERROR AND SLAUGHTER.
###5350 I WANTED TO GET A LOOK AT THIS MAN IN PERSON,
###5353 AND I HOPED OTILIA LUX DE COTI
###5356 A MEMBER OF GUATEMALA'S CONGRESS,
###5357 WOULD HELP.
###5358 HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.
###5396 Doyle: THE RÍOS MONTT PLAN FOR 1982 WAS CALLED VICTORIA.
###5401 THESE ARE PLANS THAT LAY OUT THE BROAD STRATEGY
###5406 OF HOW THE ARMY WAS GOING TO DESTROY COMMUNISM
###5409 AND WIPE OUT THE GUERRILLAS,
###5411 AND THE PLANS ARE VERY EXPLICIT ABOUT THE NEED
###5414 TO GO INTO THE MAYAN COMMUNITIES AND DESTROY THEM.
###5419 THEY CONTAIN OPERATIONAL ORDERS
###5422 TO GO INTO CERTAIN VILLAGES,
###5423 WHICH WERE, IN FACT, MASSACRED AND RAZED,
###5425 AND AFTER ACTION REPORTS IN WHICH THE COMMANDERS OF THOSE UNITS SAY,
###5430 "DUTY DONE. WE'VE, UH--WE'VE
###5433 "COMPLETED THE OPERATION,
###5435 AND THE VILLAGE IS"--
###5437 UM, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE WORDS THEY USED?
###5440 "ELIMINATED." "THE VILLAGE IS ELIMINATED.
###5442 THE VILLAGE IS NEUTRALIZED."
###5444 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###5447 Goldhagen: OTILIA LUX DE COTI IS TAKING ME
###5448 INTO THE HALLS OF CONGRESS,
###5450 WHERE THE FORMER DICTATOR MAINTAINS A POWERFUL PRESENCE.
###5455 IN THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE OF POLITICS,
###5457 THE CONGRESSWOMAN WORKS SIDE BY SIDE
###5459 WITH THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER
###5461 OF NEARLY 200,000 OF HER PEOPLE.
###5477 SEEING RÍOS MONTT IN THIS SETTING IS SURREAL.
###5481 IT'S LIKE ENCOUNTERING HITLER IN THE BUNDESTAG.
###5485 I HAVE STUDIED MASS MURDERERS FOR MORE THAN 3 DECADES,
###5489 BUT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT I MIGHT ONE DAY STAND
###5491 BEFORE A GENOCIDAL MASTERMIND FACE TO FACE.
###5497 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###5505 MAY I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
###5507 WAS THERE GENOCIDE IN GUATEMALA, AND WERE YOU RESPONSIBLE?
###5509 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###5531 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###5543 THE U.N. LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL CODES
###5546 HAVE A CONCEPT FOR GENOCIDE.
###5551 IT'S CLEARLY DEFINED.
###5556 WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO ELIMINATE AN ETHNICAL GROUP...
###5561 WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO ELIMINATE A RELIGIOUS GROUP...
###5565 OR A SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE.
###5575 THE DEFINITION CLEARLY STATES IT'S ELIMINATING SOMETHING.
###5578 THE DEFINITION STATES, ELIMINATING IN WHOLE OR IN PART
###5582 AN ETHNIC GROUP, WHICH THE MAYAN PEOPLE WERE.
###5596 HE AGREES WITH THAT.
###5598 AND SO WERE YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?
###5604 HE WOULD BE IN JAIL IF HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.
###5609 Goldhagen, voice-over: I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
###5610 BUT NOT THIS.
###5613 THE FORMER DICTATOR WAS EVASIVE AND COMBATIVE,
###5616 BUT REMARKABLY, HE STAYED TO TALK
###5617 FOR MORE THAN 20 MINUTES.
###5619 DO YOU ACCEPT THE HISTORICAL COMMISSION'S FINDING
###5621 THAT 200,000 INDIGENOUS MAYANS WERE KILLED
###5625 WHILE YOU WERE PRESIDENT BY YOUR MILITARY?
###5639 HE SAID THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE PROOF
###5640 AND CONVINCE HIM IN A COURT OF LAW.
###5646 STARING INTO THE EYES OF THIS KILLER,
###5648 I FEEL OUTRAGE AND DISGUST,
###5652 BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING, I AM REMINDED
###5654 THAT ALL OF THIS COMES DOWN TO A CHOICE.
###5657 MORE THAN 25 YEARS AGO AS THE POLITICAL LEADER OF HIS COUNTRY,
###5661 THIS MAN CONSIDERED HIS POLITICAL GOALS,
###5663 WEIGHED HIS OPTIONS, DECIDED HE COULD GET AWAY WITH IT,
###5667 AND MADE A CALCULATED DECISION TO MURDER AND EXPEL
###5670 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HIS COUNTRY'S PEOPLE.
###5674 THE QUESTION IS CAN WE GET FUTURE LEADERS TO MAKE A DIFFERENT DECISION?
###5679 I THINK WE CAN.
###5687 Woman: YOU KNOW, DANNY, YOU MIGHT BE SUGGESTING
###5688 WE CAN PREVENT ONE OF THE FEW THINGS IN THE WORLD
###5690 THAT PEOPLE SAY ARE UNSTOPPABLE
###5692 OR THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO STOP.
###5695 DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WILL JUST SAY,
###5697 "COME ON, DANNY. THAT'S--THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
###5700 "IT'S NOT JUST ONE PERSON.
###5701 "WE'VE BEEN SCREAMING ABOUT THESE ISSUES FOR A LONG TIME,
###5704 AND THE LEADERS OF THE WORLD HAVEN'T LISTENED."
###5707 THE POLITICAL LEADERS WHO KILL OTHER PEOPLE
###5710 ARE OFTEN HATE-FILLED, POSSESSED BY IDEOLOGIES
###5713 THAT LEAD THEM TO SEE GROUPS OF PEOPLE
###5715 AS NECESSARY TO SLAUGHTER,
###5717 BUT THEY ARE NOT CRAZY.
###5719 THEY ARE RATIONAL CALCULATORS OF COSTS AND BENEFITS.
###5724 AFTER ALL, THESE PEOPLE HAVE RISEN
###5725 TO THE PINNACLE OF POWER IN THEIR COUNTRIES,
###5727 AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS THINK
###5729 ABOUT THEIR COST-BENEFIT CALCULUS.
###5733 LIKE RÍOS MONTT, ALL POLITICAL LEADERS
###5736 WHO INITIATE GENOCIDES AND ELIMINATIONS
###5739 KNOW THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
###5741 IS UNLIKELY TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR DEADLY PLANS.
###5744 Woman: THIS IS CASE NUMBER IT-95-5/18-I,
###5748 THE PROSECUTOR VERSUS RADOVAN KARADZIC.
###5751 Goldhagen: WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL COURTS,
###5752 AND THEY DO SOME GOOD,
###5754 BUT THEY ARE UNBEARABLY SLOW AND INEFFECTIVE...
###5757 Man: GOOD AFTERNOON, YOUR HONOR.
###5759 AND THE KILLING CONTINUES.
###5764 SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
###5768 FROM THE TRAGEDIES IN RWANDA AND ELSEWHERE,
###5770 WE'VE SEEN THAT THE INSTITUTIONS WE RELY ON
###5772 TO COMBAT GENOCIDE DON'T WORK,
###5775 AND IT'S CLEAR THAT AS IN KENYA TIMELY INTERVENTION
###5778 CAN GET POLITICAL LEADERS
###5780 TO STOP THE ELIMINATIONIST ASSAULT.
###5784 IN DEALING WITH A RECALCITRANT GENOCIDAL LEADER IN DARFUR,
###5787 WE'VE LEARNED THAT TO BE EFFECTIVE
###5790 INTERVENTION MUST OFTEN BE FORCEFUL
###5793 AND THAT, AS WAS THE CASE IN BOSNIA,
###5796 RELATIVELY LITTLE FORCE CAN ACHIEVE EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS,
###5802 AND WE KNOW ABOVE ALL THAT GENOCIDES ARE POLITICAL
###5806 AND THEY ARE INITIATED BY A FEW LEADERS
###5808 WHOSE COST-BENEFIT CALCULATIONS CAN BE CHANGED.
###5814 WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT CALCULATION.
###5817 Goldhagen: DO WE NEED TO HAVE A NEW INTERNATIONAL ORIENTATION
###5820 TOWARDS INTERVENTION AND GENOCIDE?
###5822 DEFINITELY.
###5824 HOW WOULD YOU REWRITE THE RULES
###5825 OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ON THIS?
###5829 FIRST, GENOCIDE NEVER HAPPENS AS A SURPRISE.
###5835 NEVER.
###5839 THE SIGNS ARE USUALLY AVAILABLE AND APPARENT,
###5845 AND SO THERE SHOULD BE A DEBATE
###5850 AT THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL,
###5854 AT THE LEVEL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
###5857 AT THE LEVEL OF AFRICAN UNION,
###5858 OR OTHER POWERBROKERS
###5863 TO SET UNDER WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES
###5868 INTERVENTION WOULD BE DEEMED NECESSARY.
###5872 SO YOU DON'T WAIT UNTIL IT HAS HAPPENED.
###5875 THERE MUST BE PREVENTIVE MEASURES.
###5877 SO I THINK WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD.
###5881 Goldhagen, voice-over: BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD INDEED.
###5884 GIVEN EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN AND STUDIED, THIS MUCH IS CLEAR.
###5888 INSTEAD OF THE U.N., WE NEED AN INTERNATIONAL WATCHDOG ORGANIZATION
###5892 MADE UP OF DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THAT WILL ENFORCE
###5896 A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY ON GENOCIDE AND ELIMINATIONISM.
###5902 EACH OF THE MEMBERS MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TO INTERVENE
###5905 INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY
###5907 TO STOP CAMPAIGNS OF ELIMINATION,
###5910 BUT INTERVENTION, EVEN FORCEFUL INTERVENTION,
###5913 IS NOT ENOUGH.
###5915 BY THE TIME WE INTERVENE,
###5916 TENS OF THOUSANDS CAN BE DEAD OR HOMELESS.
###5919 WE NEED AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF PREVENTION.
###5923 WE'VE GOT TO STOP GENOCIDES BEFORE THEY HAPPEN
###5926 BY SHOWING POLITICAL LEADERS THAT THE COSTS TO THEM
###5928 WILL FOR SURE FAR OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS.
###5933 THE U.S. HAS A BOUNTY PROGRAM FOR GETTING PEOPLE
###5936 TO HUNT DOWN TERRORISTS.
###5938 WHY NOT HAVE DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES DO THE SAME
###5940 FOR LEADERS WHO PERPETRATE GENOCIDES AND ELIMINATIONS?
###5943 LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
###5946 DECLARED THE LEADERS OF COUNTRIES THAT COMMIT GENOCIDE
###5949 TO BE OUTLAWS.
###5950 THEY CAN BE HUNTED DOWN UNTIL THEY EITHER
###5953 GIVE THEMSELVES UP OR UNTIL THEY'RE KILLED.
###5956 WOULD MILOSEVIC UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
###5957 HAVE EVER INITIATED THE SLAUGHTER OF BOSNIANS?
###5962 I DON'T THINK HE WOULD.
###5963 HE COUNTED WITH POWERFUL FRIENDS
###5969 AND MOST OF ALL WITH THE FACTUAL SITUATION
###5972 ON THE GROUND, KNOWING THAT
###5974 THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS IN LOVE WITH THE STATUS QUO.
###5978 WE MUST SHOW THAT IT DOESN'T PAY.
###5982 IF PEOPLE KNEW THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY
###5988 THEY'D BE THE LOSERS,
###5990 THEY WOULD NEVER INVEST
###5993 IN A LOSING ENTERPRISE.
###5995 IT'S BECAUSE GENOCIDE IS A POLITICAL GAME,
###5997 IT'S A POWER PLAY, IT'S WORSE,
###5999 IT'S EVERYTHING.
###6001 IF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN KNEW AT THE END OF THE DAY
###6007 THEY'D BE THE LOSERS,
###6008 THEY WOULD NOT PLAY THE GAME, THAT'S FOR SURE.
###6013 Goldhagen: WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE TO DEALING
###6015 FORCEFULLY WITH GENOCIDAL LEADERS?
###6017 THE STATUS QUO,
###6019 MORE MASS MURDER, MORE LIVES DESTROYED.
###6026 THE KEY TO STOPPING GENOCIDE IS TO FOCUS ON THE LEADERS.
###6030 THE KEY TO GETTING US TO ACT IS TO IDENTIFY WITH THE VICTIMS,
###6034 TO THINK OF EACH ONE AS IF HE OR SHE WERE
###6036 YOUR DAUGHTER OR SON, YOUR SISTER OR BROTHER,
###6040 YOUR MOTHER OR YOUR FATHER.
###6042 WE'RE GONNA "T" INTO CAR--CAR-- CARMEN--
###6048 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO READ IT.
###6049 Goldhagen, voice-over: MY JOURNEY ENDS WITH MY FATHER
###6051 AT THE PLACE WHERE HIS BEGAN.
###6054 SHORTLY AFTER THE GERMANS AND THE ROMANIAN ALLIES ENTERED MY FATHER'S TOWN,
###6059 THEY SLAUGHTERED 800 JEWS.
###6061 MY FATHER AND HIS FAMILY WERE NEARLY EXECUTED
###6064 ON A DIRT ROAD BEHIND THEIR HOUSE
###6066 SOMEWHERE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
###6072 DO YOU SEE ANY TRACKS?
###6073 THEY SHOULD BE STRAIGHT AHEAD.
###6076 IF WE END HERE, THE TRACKS SHOULD BE RIGHT DOWN HERE.
###6078 HERE THEY ARE.
###6080 TATI, SEE THE TRACKS?
###6082 I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU SEE THEM?
###6083 YES, THEY'RE RIGHT THERE.
###6084 OH, I SEE. YEAH. THAT WAS HERE.
###6086 I LIVED RIGHT HERE.
###6094 I RAN OUT WITH MY FATHER BEYOND FROM THERE.
###6097 OUT THE OTHER SIDE?
###6099 YES. I REMEMBER WE RAN OVER A FENCE,
###6101 AND AS WE WERE RUNNING, A SOLDIER SPIED US
###6103 AND BEAT MY FATHER VERY SEVERELY
###6104 WITH THE BUTT OF HIS RIFLE
###6106 AND PUT US AGAINST-- SAID, "WAIT HERE,"
###6108 PUT US AGAINST-- OF COURSE THERE WAS A FENCE--
###6110 AGAINST THE FENCE,
###6112 AND THEN HE TOLD ME TO TELL THE FAMILY TO COME--
###6118 TO COME OUT.
###6119 SO HE SENT YOU BACK TO THE HOUSE?
###6120 HE SENT ME BACK TO THE HOUSE,
###6122 AND WE SAW NEIGHBORS STANDING BEYOND THIS RAILWAY,
###6127 AND WE REALIZED THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT US
###6130 IN A CERTAIN WAY THAT THEY-- IN AN OMINOUS WAY.
###6134 THEY--WHICH DIDN'T-- WHICH DIDN'T BODE WELL, TO SAY THE LEAST.
###6144 NOW THAT WE'RE HERE, IS THIS--HAS IT CHANGED YOUR VIEW?
###6146 YOU SEE, THE POINT IS THAT THE SCHOLARLY ELEMENT--
###6149 THE SCHOLAR WITHIN ME IMMEDIATELY TAKES OVER THE--
###6153 AND OVERSHADOWS THE EMOTIONS OF THE SURVIVOR
###6158 WHO REVISITS THE SCENE OF HIS NEAR DEATH.
###6162 SO AS I TALK TO YOU, I BEGIN TO REFLECT,
###6166 DRAW HISTORICAL ANALOGIES, AND SO ON,
###6169 SO THEREFORE, IT HAS A CERTAIN TEMPERING EFFECT
###6172 UPON MY EMOTIONS AS I CONFRONT
###6174 THIS HOUSE WHERE I LIVED,
###6176 THIS STREET WHERE I WALKED,
###6177 AND REFLECTED ON MY BLOOD LYING IN THE DUST HERE,
###6183 BUT WHEN I REMEMBER THAT MOMENT AS I WALKED
###6186 AND I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE--
###6188 YES, I DID REFLECT UPON HOW I WOULD LIE DEAD.
###6192 WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE DEAD
###6194 AND TO LIE IN YOUR BLOOD?
###6197 I REMEMBERED VIVIDLY THIS IMAGERY THAT I HAD AS I WALKED, AND...
###6219 Goldhagen, voice-over: WHAT MUST IT FEEL LIKE FOR A 10-YEAR-OLD BOY
###6221 TO CONTEMPLATE HIS OWN IMMINENT, VIOLENT DEATH
###6227 OR A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL OR A 19-YEAR-OLD MAN?
###6233 WHAT MUST IT FEEL LIKE TO BE IMPRISONED IN A RAPE CAMP
###6237 OR TO WATCH HELPLESSLY AS MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY ARE KILLED
###6241 OR AS YOUR PEOPLE ARE DECIMATED?
###6252 WHAT MUST IT HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR THE MEN OF SREBRENICA
###6255 WHO WERE HERDED INTO THIS WAREHOUSE
###6259 OR FOR THE OTHERS FORCED AT GUNPOINT
###6261 INTO NEARBY FIELDS TO BE EXECUTED?
###6264 [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###6303 [GUNSHOT]
###6307 [GUNSHOT]
###6309 [GUNSHOT]
###6312 [GUNSHOT]
###6317 [RAPID GUNSHOTS]
###6321 [GUNFIRE CONTINUING]
###6332 [GUNFIRE CONTINUING]
###6339 Goldhagen: WE CAN'T STAND BY ANYMORE.
###6342 PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERY DAY.
###6345 A FEW POLITICAL LEADERS START GENOCIDES.
###6348 A FEW POLITICAL LEADERS CAN STOP THEM.
###6353 THE PRESIDENTS AND PRIME MINISTERS WE ELECT
###6355 HAVE THE POWER TO END IMPUNITY AND CHANGE THE CHOICES
###6359 POTENTIAL MASS KILLERS MAKE.
###6364 WE MUST HOLD OUR LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE AND DEMAND
###6368 THAT THEY BRING AN END TO GENOCIDE AND ELIMINATIONISM.
###6389 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]
###6395 THANK YOU. HOW DO YOU SAY THANK YOU?
###6396 I NEVER REMEMBER ANYTHING.
###6398 [MAN SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE]
###6399 [REPEATS PHRASE]
###6400 EVERYONE.
###6402 Goldhagen, voice-over: I HAD BEEN WORKING ON "WORSE THAN WAR"
###6405 FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS BEFORE THE FILM PROJECT BEGAN.
###6410 WHEN I WRITE A BOOK, I CAN PRETTY MUCH SAY WHATEVER I WANT TO,
###6412 AND IF I DECIDE SOMETHING NEEDS 20 PAGES OF ELABORATION,
###6415 THEN I DO IT.
###6416 EVEN THOUGH I HAD THOUGHT AT THE BEGINNING,
###6418 "WELL, I KNOW WHAT THIS FILM SHOULD SAY,"
###6421 IT TURNED INTO SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
###6422 AND INFINITELY BETTER THAN ANYTHING
###6424 I WOULD HAVE PRODUCED HAD I BEEN THE FILMMAKER
###6428 BECAUSE I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE PRODUCED A NICE TWO-HOUR LECTURE
###6431 OF SOME KIND WITH VISUALS
###6432 INSTEAD OF A FILM THAT IS VISUALLY ARRESTING
###6435 AND EMOTIONALLY EVOCATIVE
###6437 AND, AS POWERFUL AS THE BOOK IS,
###6441 IN SOME WAYS OBVIOUSLY MORE POWERFUL.
###6446 WHEN MY FATHER AND I WENT TO WHERE HE HAD LIVED DURING THE HOLOCAUST,
###6451 SARAH MY WIFE AND GIDEON OUR SON CAME WITH US.
###6455 GIDEON AT THE TIME WAS 7 YEARS OLD,
###6458 AND HE WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED.
###6460 HE'S VERY CLOSE MY PARENTS. THEY LIVE NEARBY.
###6462 HE WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN GOING TO WHERE GRANDPA WAS FROM.
###6465 SO THEY CAME ON THE TRIP WITH US,
###6467 AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT MADE MY FATHER ENORMOUSLY HAPPY.
###6471 THAT ONE OF HIS GRANDCHILDREN COULD SEE WHERE
###6474 MY FATHER CAME FROM AND WHERE HE SUFFERED
###6477 AND WHERE HIS FAMILY SUFFERED
###6478 MADE THE TRIP, IF ONE CAN SAY SUCH A THING,
###6481 TWICE AS MOVING AND MEMORABLE AND MEANINGFUL FOR HIM.
###6492 THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT MY FATHER INFLUENCED
###6495 MY INITIAL DIRECTION OF WORKING ON THE HOLOCAUST,
###6499 BUT IT'S LESS BECAUSE HE WAS A SURVIVOR
###6500 THAN HE WAS A PROFESSOR WHO STUDIED THIS,
###6503 AND I GREW UP WITH THIS MATERIAL IN MY HOME
###6505 ALWAYS WITH THE PURPOSE NOT OF TELLING A TALE OF WOE,
###6508 WHICH IT IS, BUT OF UNDERSTANDING AND EXPLAINING.
###6511 THIS WAS ALWAYS MY ORIENTATION FROM THE TIME I CAN REMEMBER
###6515 KNOWING OR THINKING ABOUT IT OR DISCUSSING IT,
###6520 BUT IT CHANGES YOU TO SEE THE PLACES.
###6527 THE CLICHÉ "A PICTURE'S WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS"
###6531 ONLY BEGINS TO CONVEY WHAT BEING IN A PLACE
###6535 AND SITTING ACROSS FROM THE VICTIMS
###6537 AND SEEING THE LOCATIONS WHERE PEOPLE WERE SLAUGHTERED
###6541 AND BEING IN A FORENSIC LAB WITH THE REMAINS OF VICTIMS
###6545 OR BEING IN A MASS GRAVE
###6547 OR STANDING ACROSS FROM A MASTERMIND OF GENOCIDE
###6550 SUCH AS RÍOS MONTT.
###6552 IT CHANGES YOU.
###6554 IT IS MORE THAN WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS.
###6557 IT'S WORTH ENDLESS, ENDLESS VOLUMES OF WORDS.
###6563 IN RWANDA, WE GAINED ACCESS TO ONE OF THE PRISON CAMPS.
###6568 IT'S ACTUALLY A WORK CAMP FOR PRISONERS WHO CONFESSED
###6573 TO THEIR CRIMES, OR AT LEAST SOME CRIMES,
###6575 TO CONFESS TO HAVING PARTICIPATED IN THE GENOCIDE.
###6578 IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT, THERE ARE ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE IN THIS PRISON.
###6581 THERE WERE NO GUARDS.
###6583 SO WE INTERVIEWED THE PERPETRATORS IN THE FIELD.
###6585 THE WARDEN JUST BROUGHT PEOPLE TO US.
###6586 WE HAD NO IDEA WHO WE'D BE TALKING TO,
###6589 AND ALSO, WE WALKED AMONG THEM.
###6590 THEY WERE TILLING THE GROUND WITH HOES AND PICKS AND MACHETES,
###6597 CLEARING IT, AND YOU'RE WALKING AMONG THEM
###6600 WITHIN FEET OF ROWS OF THEM WIELDING THESE IMPLEMENTS,
###6603 AND YOU CAN'T BUT THINK THESE ARE THE IMPLEMENTS THEY USED TO SLAUGHTER
###6608 THEIR VICTIMS DURING THE GENOCIDE
###6611 BY THE INDIVIDUALLY, BY THE TENS, BY THE HUNDREDS,
###6614 BY THE THOUSANDS ULTIMATELY.
###6618 OK.
###6618 TELL ME WHEN.
###6621 SHAKING THE HAND OF A KILLER BEFORE I EVEN KNOW ANYTHING ELSE
###6624 ABOUT HIM EXCEPT FOR WHAT HIS NAME IS,
###6626 IS A STRANGE THING.
###6628 IT'S AN ACT OF POLITENESS.
###6629 IT'S A TIME OF HUMAN SHARING,
###6632 AND YET THAT SAME HAND-- I SHAKE THE HAND.
###6634 I THINK THE SAME HAND ACTUALLY WAS WIELDING A MACHETE
###6640 AND STRIKING AND KILLING
###6642 AND HACKING TO DEATH OTHER PEOPLE,
###6645 AND YOU CAN'T FLINCH,
###6648 AND YOU CAN'T SAY, "I DON'T WANT TO DO IT,"
###6651 AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S PART
###6654 OF WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU INTERVIEW SOMEBODY,
###6656 AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING OF SITTING ACROSS FROM SOMEONE
###6659 WHO THEN BEGINS TO TELL YOU OF THE HORRIBLE THINGS,
###6661 THE HORRIFYING THINGS THAT HE DID,
###6663 THE WAYS THAT HE DID IT.
###6666 AND SO THERE I AM, A WHOLE JUMBLE OF EMOTIONS
###6669 AND THOUGHT AND DIFFERENT ORIENTATIONS AT THE SAME TIME--
###6674 THE INTERVIEWER, THE SCHOLAR THINKING ABOUT WHAT HE SAYS,
###6677 THE ANALYST, THE HUMAN BEING SITTING
###6679 ACROSS FROM A MASS MURDERER,
###6681 FEELING A DEGREE OF SYMPATHY OR EVEN OF LIKING FOR SOMEONE,
###6684 BECAUSE SOME SEEM LIKEABLE,
###6686 AND ALSO ALWAYS KEEPING IN MIND THAT THESE ARE MASS MURDERERS.
###6698 TO BE ABLE IN MAKING THIS FILM TO GO TO ANY NUMBER OF COUNTRIES
###6704 AND TO TALK TO THE VICTIMS, TO TALK TO THE PERPETRATORS,
###6706 JUST TO SEE THE PLACES I'D READ ABOUT
###6710 WAS TRANSFORMATIVE,
###6712 AND I THINK BACK ON THE PEOPLE QUITE OFTEN I TALKED TO.
###6717 THEY RESONATE WITH ME. THEIR FACES I SEE.
###6720 IN THE FILM, MY FATHER AND SOME OTHERS TALKED ABOUT SEEING FACES.
###6726 THEY'RE HAUNTED BY THEM, OR THEY REMEMBER THEM,
###6728 THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIED.
###6730 WELL, THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE I SPOKE WITH AND THEIR WORDS ARE WITH ME
###6735 IN THE WAY THAT THE TESTIMONY IN DOCUMENTS
###6740 AND COURT TESTIMONY AND SO ON NEVER ARE WITH ME.
###6743 I HEAR THEM, I SEE THEM, I THINK ABOUT THEM.
###6748 I ABSORBED AND INTERNALIZED THINGS INTO MY BEING
###6753 THAT WERE NEVER THERE AND THAT WILL NEVER LEAVE ME.
