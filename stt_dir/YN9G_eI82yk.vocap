###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Mondays, not awesome. But getting on CNN STUDENT NEWS definitely
###5 is. And today we`re going to tell you how you can make it happen. I`m Carl Azuz. Let`s
###19 go!
###24 First up today, we are talking about violence in Afghanistan. Suicide bombings, three of
###28 them, all of them targeting a U.S. Afghan base in the eastern part of the country. Officials
###33 say at least three Afghan soldiers and two civilians were killed. The Taliban, the militant
###39 group that used to control most of Afghanistan says it`s responsible for these attacks. They
###44 happened earlier Sunday morning before sunrise. Afghan authorities say all nine of the attackers
###49 were killed, either in the bombings or in the firefight with U.S. and Afghan troops
###55 that happened afterward. This isn`t the first time that the base has been targeted by suicide
###59 bombings. It`s located in a region that`s home to a lot of insurgent activity.
###64 Next up today, we`re looking at the political unrest in Egypt. An elected assembly has drafted
###69 a new constitution, but only after more moderate members of that assembly left, complaining
###75 they weren`t being heard. On Saturday, the assembly turned over the draft to President
###80 Mohamed Morsi. That`s him on the right, he said there`ll be a referendum, a vote on December
###85 15th. After that announcement protests broke out, some from people who support President
###90 Morsi, some from people who think he`s trying to give himself too much power.
###95 Egypt`s Supreme Court was planning to review the constitution, but some of Morsi`s supporters
###100 gathered outside the court building. The court canceled its sessions indefinitely. It said
###105 judges won`t go back to work until they can do their jobs without "any psychological or
###111 physical pressures."

###114 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just the facts: Parkinson`s disease is a disorder of the human nervous
###120 system. Unintentional shaking may be the most well-known sign of Parkinson`s. But it can
###125 also cause stiffness or slower movements. It can affect someone`s balance or speech.
###131 Doctors don`t know what causes Parkinson`s disease and there`s no cure for it. But medications
###136 can help improve its symptoms.
###139 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###141 AZUZ: All right, so we don`t know what causes Parkinson`s. we do know about 4 million people
###147 worldwide have it, and tens of thousands of new cases are diagnosed every year. Now, there
###153 is a man who says he`s found a new way to make that diagnosis. Normally when something
###158 is wrong, you go to a doctor. In this case, you might not even have to be in the room.
###163 Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains what we mean.
###165 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###166 DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Max Little has a bold idea -- what if doctors could detect
###172 Parkinson`s disease simply by the sound of your voice?
###176 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A-a-a ....
###177 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A-a-a ...
###178 GUPTA: Max Little is close to proving just that. He says one simple voice test will determine
###184 if someone has Parkinson`s. And all you need is a telephone.
###187 MAX LITTLE, MATHEMATICIAN: We`ve got an ultra low-cost way of detecting the disease.
###193 GUPTA: What makes this discovery even more incredible, Max isn`t a doctor. He is a mathematician.
###200 LITTLE: My name is Max Little, and for a living I do applied mathematics.
###205 GUPTA (on camera): So, just in terms of the process, if someone picks up the phone and
###213 calls, what are they told to do?
###215 LITTLE: So, we`ve set up a study called Parkinson`s Voice Initiative. And the idea with that study
###221 is that we want to collect enough data that we can test this technology outside the lab,
###227 so we are collecting recordings from people in all sorts of circumstances that we can`t
###233 control.
###234 And we want to then test our ability to be able to, you know, accurately detect whether
###238 they have Parkinson`s disease or not. In lab- based studies we can get 99 percent detection
###244 accuracy. But can we get that sort of accuracy over the telephone when we don`t have that
###251 sort of controlled circumstances. That`s why we need to do the study.
###252 GUPTA: 99 percent though?
###253 LITTLE: Yeah. Yeah. That`s the overall accuracy. Yeah.
###255 In this case, what will happen is that people will call in, they simply say whether or not
###263 they have been diagnosed with Parkinson`s. And then they -- we just ask them to say A--a-a
###267 for as long as they can.
###268 GUPTA: That`s it?
###269 LITTLE: Yeah.
###270 GUPTA: It sounds so remarkably simple.
###272 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A-a-a -a-a ...
###275 GUPTA: So, what do you hear there?
###279 LITTLE: Yes, that`s a classic example of vocal tremor. You can actually hear the tremor in
###284 the way that the vocal folds, the laringia muscles are twitching somewhere.
###288 And that affects the pitch.
###290 GUPTA: So, the same soft of tremor that you have in your hands, your arms -- you`re saying
###295 that`s basically happening around in the muscles around your vocal cords.
###298 LITTLE: That`s right. Yeah.

###301 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###302 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Mr. Osborn`s economics and history
###307 classes at Creswell High School in Creswell, Oregon.
###312 Which of these bodies of water is the largest? Here we go. Is it the Persian Gulf, Black
###318 Sea, Gulf of Mexico or Lake Superior? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###327 The Gulf of Mexico is the biggest option here covering an area of around 600,000 square
###334 miles. That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."
###340 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###341 AZUZ: Part of that massive area of the Gulf of Mexico is now a crime scene in a real life
###346 mystery. Authorities in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi are trying to find a killer
###351 -- but not somebody who is targeting people: Ed Lavandera tells us what animals have become
###357 targets and what makes it so difficult to investigate their murders.
###361 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###361 ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: To reach the crime scenes, you need to catch a ride
###366 and take a guide.
###366 In this island that we see (inaudible), this is Dear Island, where you found two of them?
###369 DR. MOBY SOLANGI, INSTITUTE FOR MARINE MAMMAL STUDIES: That`s correct.
###371 LAVANDERA (voice over): A Harrison County Mississippi sheriff`s chopper and Moby Solangi,
###375 the lead biologist from the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies. They took us to see
###380 the sites where most of the murdered dolphins have mysteriously emerged along the Mississippi
###385 Gulf Coast.
###385 (on camera): So, Moby, get us up to date how many dolphins have turned up here so far?
###390 SOLANGI: We`ve been dealing with about six or seven. We know that these three or four
###395 of them have been found dead with bullets.
###397 LAVANDERA (voice over): Federal investigators say they don`t know yet if the murders are
###401 the work of one dolphin killer or all unrelated, but even in the wild, it`s easy for a killer
###407 to lure in dolphins.
###411 Katherine Burton trains dolphins at the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies.
###414 KATHERINE BURTON, MAMMAL TRAINER: They are very curious, and I think by getting fed ...
###419 LAVANDERA (on camera): Even out in the wild.
###420 BURTON: Yes. Out in the wild, they will get fairly close.
###422 LAVANDERA: So they can get themselves in the bad situation just unsuspecting.
###425 BURTON: Right. I think sometimes they get close without realizing they are going to
###431 be in any kind of danger.
###432 LAVANDERA (voice over): That`s why it`s actually illegal to feed dolphins in the wild.
###436 (on camera): So, this is Sheep Island where one of the dolphins was found?
###438 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.
###438 LAVANDERA (voice over): Rusty Pittman is an officer with Mississippi`s Department of Marine
###442 Resources, one of the agencies patrolling these waters.
###445 (on camera): It seems so much more difficult to investigate something like this. You know,
###449 if you have a murder of humans, you have ...
###452 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Evidence .
###453 LAVANDERA: You have evidence, there is a crime scene.
###454 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.
###454 There`s you go.
###455 LAVANDERA: This crime scene is huge.
###456 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But like you said, you`ve got so much area through here. This is totally
###461 different than a crime scene involving humans.
###464 LAVANDERA (voice over): This part of the Gulf Coast is home to the largest population of
###468 dolphins anywhere in the United States, as many as 5,000. The race is on to catch a dolphin
###474 killer before he strikes again.
###475 Ed Lavandera, CNN, Gulfport, Mississippi.
###478 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###479 AZUZ: The season of giving is about more than presents. From now through the holidays, people
###483 are finding ways to volunteer, to give back, to make a difference for others. If you are
###488 doing this, we want to hear about it in an I-report, you`ve got to give it in by December
###492 14th. And if you are wondering how do I send in an I-report, we are glad you asked.
###496 CHRIS LETT, CNN RESEARCHER: So, you want to be on CNN STUDENT NEWS? Me too. I`ll show
###500 you how by submitting an I-report video. So let`s see what assignments are up on our CNN
###505 STUDENT NEWS I-report page. I- report.com/cnnstudentnews. We are going to do an I-report on how to submit
###512 an I-report. Let`s get a camera and start rolling.
###515 No, I know I need to keep this short. No more than 30 seconds, and I can`t use any music.
###520 If I do, they won`t be able to use my I-report.
###523 So, just me and the camera.
###526 Hi, I`m Chris. And this is an I-Report about I-Reports.
###531 OK, done shooting now, it`s back to the STUDENT NEWS, I-Report page.
###534 Upload my story, fill out all the information and now I`m done. No way, I`m not.
###538 They say I need to watch out for an email after I submit this video.
###543 Hey, here it is.
###544 OK, a couple of things to fill out. If I weren`t 18, I`d need to have my parents to sign this.
###551 But I`m over 18, so I can sign it myself.
###554 Then send this back to the STUDENT NEWS team and they`ll let me know when my I-Report is
###558 going to be on the show.
###560 AZUZ: And sometimes you might notice something`s happening behind me in the newsroom here during
###564 our show. This meteorologist doesn`t have to worry about what`s behind him, he`s got
###570 something happening below him -- check out the bottom of his screen, it`s a cat walked
###575 right though the live broadcast, and then hung around for a while. What`s awesome is
###579 that the reporter doesn`t even flinch. Thankfully, the cat didn`t come near a microphone, because
###584 you know how we TV folks can get -- we can be just so catty.
###587 That`s a tail for another day, so we hope you enjoy the rest of yours. For CNN STUDENT
###591 NEWS, I`m Carl Azuz.
