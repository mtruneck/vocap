0:0:9,92 --> 0:0:11,53
SHANE SMITH: We're going
right now to meet


3
0:0:11,53 --> 0:0:13,7
an imam, or a cleric--


4
0:0:13,7 --> 0:0:18,2
so a religious guy, the guys
who run this country.


5
0:0:18,2 --> 0:0:19,97
And he's apparently kind
of a hip imam.


6
0:0:19,97 --> 0:0:21,455
He runs a coffee shop now.


7
0:0:21,455 --> 0:0:24,38
He's one of the guys who rebuilt
Iranian cinema after


8
0:0:24,38 --> 0:0:25,75
the revolution.


9
0:0:25,75 --> 0:0:29,235
And so we're going to go hear
his stories about that and


10
0:0:29,235 --> 0:0:31,52
about being one of the
first religious


11
0:0:31,52 --> 0:0:33,2
leaders involved in film.


12
0:0:33,2 --> 0:0:36,296



13
0:0:36,296 --> 0:0:38,168
Salaam, Ali.


14
0:0:38,168 --> 0:0:39,58
[SPEAKING FARSI]


15
0:0:39,58 --> 0:1:30,71



16
0:1:30,71 --> 0:1:32,28
-Where are you from?


17
0:1:32,28 --> 0:1:33,26
-Iran.


18
0:1:33,26 --> 0:1:35,3
-Iran, yeah.


19
0:1:35,3 --> 0:1:37,275
-I'm sorry.


20
0:1:37,275 --> 0:1:39,6
SHANE SMITH: In fact, "The
Snowman" is a film that was


21
0:1:39,6 --> 0:1:41,44
banned because it featured
cross-dressing.


22
0:1:41,44 --> 0:1:43,77
It's a story about a guy that
wants to move to America.


23
0:1:43,77 --> 0:1:46,41
So he dresses like a woman so
he can marry an American man


24
0:1:46,41 --> 0:1:47,302
and get a visa.


25
0:1:47,302 --> 0:1:50,43
It's kind of like "Tootsie"
meets "Monty Python."


26
0:1:50,43 --> 0:1:51,84
And it was banned
and shut down.


27
0:1:51,84 --> 0:1:55,4
And no one could see it until
the Ayatollah Khomeini saw it,


28
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:56,73
laughed, and said hey, this
is a great movie.


29
0:1:56,73 --> 0:1:58,7
I thought it was funny,
it's fine.


30
0:1:58,7 --> 0:2:0,58
So they released it and it
became the number one box


31
0:2:0,58 --> 0:2:2,3
office success in
Iranian history.


32
0:2:2,3 --> 0:2:5,4
And this is the cleric
that produced it.


33
0:2:5,4 --> 0:2:6,24
Thank you very much.


34
0:2:6,24 --> 0:2:6,61
Merci.


35
0:2:6,61 --> 0:2:6,98
MOHHAMAD-ALI ZAM: Thank you.


36
0:2:6,98 --> 0:2:9,25
SHANE SMITH: I guess Iranian
film industry must be doing


37
0:2:9,25 --> 0:2:9,85
really well.


38
0:2:9,85 --> 0:2:12,69
Because when we were there,
there were about 10 film sets


39
0:2:12,69 --> 0:2:14,38
shooting simultaneously.


40
0:2:14,38 --> 0:2:17,2
In fact, when we left the tea
house, there was a film


41
0:2:17,2 --> 0:2:19,945
shooting in the park right
across the way.


42
0:2:19,945 --> 0:2:22,45
They're about to crash that
bike into that pond.


43
0:2:22,45 --> 0:2:23,779
[SPEAKING FARSI]


44
0:2:23,779 --> 0:2:37,97



45
0:2:37,97 --> 0:2:39,775
SHANE SMITH: Good work.


46
0:2:39,775 --> 0:2:42,91
So finally, after going to about
20 film sets, meeting


47
0:2:42,91 --> 0:2:45,415
all the producers and all the
directors and all the actors,


48
0:2:45,415 --> 0:2:47,26
it was time for the big
event of the year.


49
0:2:47,26 --> 0:2:51,176
It was time for the awards
ceremony at the Film Festival.


50
0:2:51,176 --> 0:2:54,15
Now, I've been asked the night
before to go accept the award


51
0:2:54,15 --> 0:2:57,1
for Guy Maddin who was going
to win Best Experimental


52
0:2:57,1 --> 0:3:0,84
Documentary Film for his
movie, "My Winnipeg."


53
0:3:0,84 --> 0:3:1,73
Now, I'm Canadian.


54
0:3:1,73 --> 0:3:2,6
Guy's Canadian.


55
0:3:2,6 --> 0:3:4,33
We'd interviewed him for BBS.


56
0:3:4,33 --> 0:3:7,15
So I said sure, I'll go up and
say on behalf of Guy Maddin,


57
0:3:7,15 --> 0:3:8,23
thank you very much.


58
0:3:8,23 --> 0:3:9,25
And they said no, no, no.


59
0:3:9,25 --> 0:3:11,2
And I said OK, I'll say
Guy says thanks.


60
0:3:11,2 --> 0:3:13,27
And they said, just
accept the award.


61
0:3:13,27 --> 0:3:15,48
So I twig on to the fact
that they want to seem


62
0:3:15,48 --> 0:3:16,22
cosmopolitan.


63
0:3:16,22 --> 0:3:18,97
So I take the bait and say
great, I'll do it.


64
0:3:18,97 --> 0:3:21,445
So we're learning Farsi
to accept the award.


65
0:3:21,445 --> 0:3:24,38
And we're going to be filmed by
three national television


66
0:3:24,38 --> 0:3:26,735
stations, too.


67
0:3:26,735 --> 0:3:29,561
So we're going to be fraudulent
celebrities.


68
0:3:29,561 --> 0:3:32,765



69
0:3:32,765 --> 0:3:34,26
So the ceremony finally
starts.


70
0:3:34,26 --> 0:3:35,62
There's all kinds of
filmmakers there.


71
0:3:35,62 --> 0:3:37,1
There's government officials.


72
0:3:37,1 --> 0:3:38,85
There's the Mayor of Tehran.


73
0:3:38,85 --> 0:3:41,2
And they're giving out the
awards, until finally Best


74
0:3:41,2 --> 0:3:42,12
Documentary Film comes up.


75
0:3:42,12 --> 0:3:43,37
[SPEAKING FARSI]


76
0:3:43,37 --> 0:3:55,557



77
0:3:55,557 --> 0:3:57,529
Thank you so much, Mr.
Maddin, for your


78
0:3:57,529 --> 0:3:59,8
participation in this festival.


79
0:3:59,8 --> 0:3:59,994
And congratulations.

0:3:59,994 --> 0:4:1,473
[SPEAKING FARSI]


81
0:4:1,473 --> 0:4:14,291



82
0:4:14,291 --> 0:4:16,509
SHANE SMITH: Thank you
for the festival and


83
0:4:16,509 --> 0:4:17,742
the people of Tehran.


84
0:4:17,742 --> 0:4:18,995
[SPEAKING FARSI]


85
0:4:18,995 --> 0:4:28,434



86
0:4:28,434 --> 0:4:29,886
So there's a standing ovation.


87
0:4:29,886 --> 0:4:31,338
People are freaking out.


88
0:4:31,338 --> 0:4:34,47
The Mayor of Tehran comes
up and hugs me.


89
0:4:34,47 --> 0:4:37,64
Newspapers and TV are going
"Western director loves Iran."


90
0:4:37,64 --> 0:4:39,905
I was sitting there laughing
my head off.


91
0:4:39,905 --> 0:4:41,52
It wasn't my award.


92
0:4:41,52 --> 0:4:42,33
Sorry, Guy.


93
0:4:42,33 --> 0:4:43,64
Great film though.


94
0:4:43,64 --> 0:4:44,96
That was our last
night in Tehran.


95
0:4:44,96 --> 0:4:48,28



96
0:4:48,28 --> 0:4:50,84
Pretty much all the stereotypes
that we had seen


97
0:4:50,84 --> 0:4:54,12
in Western media before going to
Iran were dispelled when we


98
0:4:54,12 --> 0:4:54,675
went there.


99
0:4:54,675 --> 0:4:55,667
We met empowered women.


100
0:4:55,667 --> 0:4:57,1
We met progressive clerics.


101
0:4:57,1 --> 0:4:58,63
We met beautiful actresses.


102
0:4:58,63 --> 0:5:0,78
We met fantastic filmmakers.


103
0:5:0,78 --> 0:5:3,23
And these fantastic filmmakers
have been showing another side


104
0:5:3,23 --> 0:5:5,63
of Iran, a side of Iran
that we're now


105
0:5:5,63 --> 0:5:8,39
seeing with the dissent.


106
0:5:8,39 --> 0:5:10,57
So what we've seen for the
past 20 years in Iranian


107
0:5:10,57 --> 0:5:13,7
cinema, what we saw when we were
in Tehran, and what the


108
0:5:13,7 --> 0:5:16,7
world saw during their last
elections shows that what the


109
0:5:16,7 --> 0:5:20,9
Iranian people think and what
the actual government does are


110
0:5:20,9 --> 0:5:22,15
completely different.


111
0:5:22,15 --> 0:5:26,1
And that hopefully we might be
at the cusp of a new Iranian


112
0:5:26,1 --> 0:5:27,35
revolution.


113
0:5:27,35 --> 0:7:27,35
