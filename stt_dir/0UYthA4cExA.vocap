###0 OKAY. GOOD MORNING ALL. CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU
###4 ALL WHO TRAVELED THROUGH THE INCLEMENT WEATHER THIS
###6 MORNING. I AM PROUD OF YOU. THANKS FOR COMING. JUST
###12 A REMINDER, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE NOT HERE ON
###15 WEDNESDAY, NEXT WEEK, NEXT FRIDAY WE START THE BOOK
###18 CLUB. SO 20 PEOPLE SIGNED UP SO FAR. IF ANYONE ELSE
###23 WANTS TO SIGN UP PLEASE COME UP AFTERWARDS AND PUT
###26 YOUR NAME AND EMAIL HERE. I WILL BE HOLDING OFFICE
###33 HOURS TODAY, OFFICE HOURS IN 20 WHATEVER. SAME
###39 ROOM THAT LOU WAS USING PREVIOUSLY, 13 MAYBE. SO COME
###46 ALONG IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS I AM HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU
###50 ALL. OKAY. SO IN THE LAST, THE OTHER THING I WANT TO
###54 REMIND YOU OF IS THE UNDERSTANDING EVOLUTION WEB SITE.
###57 I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS ON WEDNESDAY. IT IS A REALLY
###60 GOOD RESOURCE. AND A LOT OF USEFUL INFORMATION THERE
###66 PARTICULARLY, TO DO WITH PHYLOGENETIC'S AND THE TREE
###68 
###74 LECTURE WE WENT THROUGH THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE
###79 SO-CALLED THEORY OF EVOLUTION. FOUNDATIONS OF
###82 EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY. WE SORT OF ENDED UP WITH TWO
###85 BIG IDEAS.
###86 THE FIRST WAS THE PRINCIPLE OF DESCENT WITH
###95 MODIFICATION.
###107 AND THE SECOND WAS THE PRINCIPLE OF
###114 NATURAL SELECTION.
###119 SO WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY IS JUST TAKE YOU
###121 THROUGH EACH OF THOSE. INTRODUCE YOU TO EACH OF THESE
###124 IDEAS AND THEN WE WILL GO ON TO LOOK AT THE TREE OF
###130 LIFE. HOW WE UNDERSTAND RELATIONSHIPS AMONGST
###133 ORGANISMS GIVEN THEY HAVE DESCENDED THROUGH EVOLUTION
###138 THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR.
###143 TODAY IS ABOUT THE TREE OF LIFE AND IT CONNECTS WITH
###145 A LAB THAT YOU HAVE MAYBE NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER.
###148 I AM NOT SURE WHICH.
###152 SO, LET'S LOOK FIRST OF ALL THIS IDEA OF DESCENT
###162 SPECIES IN
###163 DARWIN'S BIG BOOK. THERE IS ONLY ONE FIGURE IN THE
###166 WHOLE BOOK. THE REST OF IT IS A BUNCH OF WONDERFUL
###169 WORDS. BUT THE FIGURE, THAT FIGURE WAS REPRODUCED IN
###174 THE LECTURE NOTES FROM WEDNESDAY, THE LAST LECTURE.
###177 BUT IT IS SORT OF CARTOON VERSION OF IT WOULD LOOK
###182 SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AND SO ON.
###193 THIS IS TIME COMING TO THE PRESENT. THIS IS THE
###206 PAST. ACROSS HERE WE HAVE SOME PHENOTYPE. IT IS THAT
###220 THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ORGANISMS COULD BE LIFE
###223 HISTORY, COULD BE GROWTH FORMS, COULD BE A WHOLE
###228 VARIETY OF THINGS WE WILL SEE LATER.
###230 SO, SOME OF THESE THINGS DON'T GO ALL OF THE WAY
###236 TO THE TIPS. THESE ARE EXTINCT FORMS. DEAD. OFF THE
###242 PLANET. AND WE HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR.
###253 SO THESE TIPS
###255 OF THE TREE ARE LIVING FORMS. THAT IS WHAT WE CAN SEE
###259 ON THE PLANET NOW AND THEY ARE DERIVED FROM A COMMON
###263 ANCESTOR OVER TIME AND BECOMING EXTINCT OVER TIME IN
###267 
###274 THIS PATTERN OF DESCENT COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION.
###277 YEAH IT IS EARLY, ISN'T IT. SO COMMON ANCESTOR,
###292 DIVERSIFIED OVER TIME AND THEN DISCONTINUITIES
###294 ARISING. GAPS IN THAT DISTRIBUTION OF PHENOTYPES
###300 BECAUSE OF EXTINCTION.
###304 SO WE HAVE DISCONTINUITIES
###314 ARISING THROUGH
###314 COMBINATION OF DIVERGENCES IN FORM OVER TIME.
###320 COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY PUNCHES
###322 HOLES IN THE DISTRIBUTION. LINEAGES BECOME EXTINCT
###326 CREATING GAPS IN THESE PHENOTYPES. SO HOW DOES THIS
###331 ALL RELATE TO WHAT WE SEE TODAY? WELL, WE SEE
###335 VARIETIES OR SUB-SPECIES AMONG THE MOST CLOSELY
###338 RELATED THINGS. THEY ARE CLUSTERED INTO SPECIES. NOW
###343 WE ARE COMING BACK TO THE LINNAEAN HIERARCHY OF
###346 TAXONOMY, VARIETIES OF SUB-SPECIES, SPECIES, GENERA.
###351 MAYBE THIS WHOLE THING IS A GENUS. SO, THAT IS A
###354 SPECIES. MAYBE ALL THIS IS A GENUS. SO, THIS FIGURE
###362 
###364 IDEAS OF A COMMON ANCESTOR, DESCENT, EXTINCTION.
###369 GIVING RISE TO THE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY WE SEE TODAY.
###374 VERY SIMPLE IDEA. AND, IN FACT, DARWIN DIDN'T REALLY
###379 SEE HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VARIETIES OR SUB-SPECIES
###384 AND SPECIES. THE BOOK ULTIMATELY WAS ABOUT
###387 SPECIATION, ABOUT THE FORMATION OF NEW SPECIES THROUGH
###390 EVOLUTION. HE SAW SPECIES AS ONE PART OF THIS
###394 CONTINUUM OF EVOLUTION THROUGH TIME. AND THAT THEY
###401 ARE MAPPED BY THESE DISCONTINUITIES. AND THAT THIS
###403 WHAT ENDS UP AS ONE CLUSTER. IF YOU LACK PHENOTYPES OR
###407 THE INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER THAN
###409 THEY ARE TO ANYTHING ELSE. HERE IS ANOTHER CLUSTER
###413 HERE PERHAPS. ANOTHER CLUSTER HERE. SO NOW YOU HAVE
###418 3 SPECIES HERE. BUT THE REASON WE CAN DISCERN THEM,
###422 DETECT THEM IS BECAUSE OF THESE DISCONTINUITIES CAUSED
###425 BY EXTINCTION. PUTTING HOLES IN THIS DISTRIBUTION OF
###431 PHENOTYPE. MAKE SENSE? NO? ANY QUESTIONS? 8
###437 
###440 IT
###449 DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU GET THESE
###450 DISCONTINUITIES THROUGH THIS DIVERSIFICATION PROCESS.
###454 YOU MIGHT CALL THIS A SPECIES, THIS A SPECIES AND THIS
###459 A SPECIES. THEY ARE ALL SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY HAVE
###462 A COMMON ANCESTOR SO THEY ARE GROUPED INTO A GENUS.
###464 OKAY? AND SO GENERA ARE GROUPED IN FAMILIES.
###472 FAMILIES ARE GROUPED INTO ORDERS.
###479 SO, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A SINGLE SPECIES IN
###481 A GENUS. HOMOSAPIENS IS THE ONLY EXTANT HOMO. IT IS
###488 WITHIN THE HOMINIDS WHICH IS A BIG GROUPING. DOES
###493 THAT MAKE SENSE?
###497 SO, IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE WE HAVE GOT 3
###499 SPECIES IN A GENUS. IN OTHER CASE YOU MAY HAVE
###502 SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY DISTINCTIVE OUT HERE. SO, IT
###505 IS THAT MORE DISTINCTION THAT DISTINCT MIGHT BE A
###509 SINGLE SPECIES IN A SINGLE GENUS.
###510 CAUSED BY BOTH. THE BRANCHING PROCESS OVER TIME
###519 
###528 BOTH THINGS HAPPENING SIMULTANEOUSLY. OKAY. ALL
###532 RIGHT. WE CAN COME BACK TO THIS AS NEED BE. LET'S
###536 LOOK AT THE SECOND IDEA, WHICH IS THE PRINCIPLE OF
###538 NATURAL SELECTION.
###540 WE WILL COME BACK TO THIS IN MORE DETAIL LATER.
###552 BUT ARISES FROM SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS AND A SORT OF
###557 CHAIN OF LOGIC THAT DARWIN AND WALLACE PUT FORWARD.
###560 THAT IS, INDIVIDUALS VARY FOR TRAITS. THAT IS;
###576 CHARACTERISTICS, ALL VARY IN HEIGHT, EYE COLOR, HAIR
###579 COLOR, A WHOLE BUNCH OF PROPERTIES. EACH ONE OF THOSE
###582 IS A TRAIT.
###588 IF THOSE TRAITS ARE AT LEAST PARTLY
###593 HERITABLE,
###599 THAT IS, PASSED FROM PARENT TO OFFSPRING,
###601 IF INDIVIDUALS CARRYING THOSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF
###607 TRAITS VARY IN SURVIVAL OR REPRODUCTION,
###622 THAT IS,
###624 SO-CALLED FITNESS, SO IF THOSE THREE CONDITIONS ARE
###631 MET, THEN THE TRAITS THAT INCREASE SURVIVAL AND
###636 REPRODUCTION WILL BECOME MORE COMMON IN THE NEXT
###639 
###644 SOME VARIETIES, LET'S SAY GET BLUE EYES, INCREASE THE
###648 SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION FOR SOME REASON. WE KNOW IT
###651 IS HERITABLE. IF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH BLUE EYES IN
###656 THIS AUDIENCE LEAVE MORE OFFSPRING TO THE NEXT
###658 GENERATION, BLUE EYES ITSELF WILL BE MORE COMMON IN
###662 THAT POPULATION. OKAY?
###669 SO, YOU INCREASE THE PROPORTION OF FAVORABLE
###674 TRAITS IN THE NEXT GENERATION. SO, VERY IMPORTANT
###683 THING HERE. INDIVIDUALS THAT REPRODUCE OR DIE. IT IS
###691 POPULATIONS OR SPECIES THAT EVOLVE. INDIVIDUALS DO
###694 NOT EVOLVE. OKAY? ONLY POPULATION, ONLY GROUPS OF
###700 INDIVIDUALS HAVE THIS CHARACTERISTIC POPULATIONS AND
###703 SPECIES.
###703 BUT THEY DO SO BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN
###718 REPRODUCTION AND SURVIVAL AMONGST INDIVIDUALS
###721 ACCORDING TO THE TRAITS THAT THEY CARRY.
###731 OKAY. AND WE ARE GOING TO COME BACK TO THIS
###741 IN MORE
###742 SOPHISTICATED MATHEMATICAL TERMS LATER ON.
###749 SO, BRIEFLY MENTIONED, I WILL COME BACK AND
###751 REVISIT THE IDEA OF THE WAY THEY KNITTED TOGETHER THE
###755 EVIDENCE FOR THIS IDEA. TWO IDEAS, DISSENT WITH
###762 MODIFICATION, NATURAL SELECTION. THEY ARE THE TWO
###768 OBSERVATIONS. SO AGAIN, SOME OF THE EVIDENCE THAT, I
###773 CAN'T SPELL TODAY, THAT THEY BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THIS
###783 WAS ARTIFICIAL SELECTION. THAT IS, BREEDERS OF
###792 PIGEONS AND DOGS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. AND THAT
###797 SHOWED IF YOU PREFER A PARTICULAR VARIANT IN THE
###800 POPULATION AND ONLY BRED WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS, FOR
###804 EXAMPLE, THAT YOU SAW THE INCREASE IN THE PREFERRED
###809 TRAIT.
###810 THE OTHER LINES OF EVIDENCE THAT I MENTIONED IN
###816 THE LAST LECTURE WERE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS
###819 POPULATION PRESSURE. THERE IS COMPETITION. MORE
###827 OFFSPRING ARE PRODUCED THAT CAN SURVIVE. MORE ZYGOTES
###831 
###836 DIFFERENCES IN REPRODUCTION AND SURVIVAL.
###837 THE FOSSIL RECORD
###847 WHICH SHOWS BY EXTINCTION
###854 AND
###855 PROVIDES DIRECT EVIDENCE AS WE WILL SEE LATER TO
###859 TRANSITIONAL FORMS.
###866 BY RECONSTRUCTING CHARACTERISTICS
###867 BACK FROM THE TREE OF LIFE, YOU CAN PREDICT THAT THERE
###870 SHOULD BE SOMETHING IN THE PAST THAT HAS A PARTICULAR
###873 COMBINATION OF CHARACTERISTICS. AND, IF YOU ARE
###878 FORTUNATE YOU CAN TEST THAT PREDICTION IF YOU HAVE
###880 A REALLY GOOD FOSSIL RECORD BY LOOKING FOR THAT GROUP
###882 OF ORGANISMS. YOU CAN TEST IT BY LOOKING FOR THAT
###884 COMBINATION OF FORMS. AND WE WILL SEE AN EXAMPLE OF
###887 THAT LATER ON. WE TALKED ABOUT BIOGEOGRAPHY, ISLAND
###892 RADIATIONS, AND SO FORTH. AGAIN, DARWIN AND WALLACE
###900 SAW THESE OR CONTRIBUTED TO THIS IDEA. THE OTHER ONE I
###906 WANT TO SPENT A MINUTE ON HERE BECAUSE IT RELATES TO
###909 HOW WE ESTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS, COMES FROM THE
###913 EMBRYOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. WHICH IS, THE
###924 
###936 PARTICULAR STRUCTURES THAT DIFFER AMONG RELATED GROUPS
###940 OF ORGANISMS BUT THEY ALL COME FROM A SINGLE ANCESTOR
###943 CONDITION THROUGH DESCENT OF MODIFICATION.
###950 SO, LET'S LOOK AT THIS IDEA A BIT. PRINCIPLE OF
###954 HOMOLOGY.
###955 SO, AT THIS POINT I WANT YOU TO TURN TO THE
###963 FOURTH SLIDE. I HOPE YOU CAN ALL ACCESS THESE NOW ON
###966 THE WEB. PRINT THEM OUT, BRING THEM ALONG. DID YOU
###970 REMEMBER TO DO THAT? I TOLD YOU SO.
###975 PRINT THEM OUT. MY DRAWING IS TRULY AWFUL. ANY
###982 QUESTIONS?
###984 OKAY.
###987 SO, LET'S LOOK AT AN EXAMPLE ON SLIDE 4. I WILL
###990 NOT DRAW IT. BUT CONSIDER TETRAPOD VERTEBRATES, THAT
###993 IS THE BIRDS, MAMMALS, REPTILES, AMPHIBIANS. THAT FALL
###1001 IN VERTEBRATES. SO, IN HUMANS OR MAMMALS YOU HAVE A
###1005 FOREARM. THIS THING. IN CATS YOU HAVE FULL A LIMB.
###1012 
###1019 YOU HAVE A FLIPPER AT THE FRONT. IN BATS YOU HAVE GOT
###1023 A WING. IF YOU LOOK IN DETAIL AT THE ANATOMY AND THE
###1028 DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THOSE TETRAPODS YOU SEE THEY ARE
###1032 ALL DERIVED FROM A COMMON STRUCTURE. THE TETRAPOD
###1036 FOUR LIMB. IT ONLY MAKES SENSE IN A LOT OF EVOLUTION.
###1042 FUNCTIONALLY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES FLYING, SWIMMING,
###1045 WALKING, WAVING. ALL COME FROM A COMMON ANCESTRAL
###1050 CONDITION, WHICH IS THE ANCESTRAL FOUR LIMB. AGAIN YOU
###1055 CAN SEE THAT IN DEVELOPMENT AND MOLECULAR DETAILS OF
###1057 DEVELOPMENT AND THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. TURNING TO
###1064 EMBRYOS, IF YOU COMPARE THE END EMBRYONIC STAGES OF AN
###1070 AMPHIBIAN, A REPTILE, A BIRD OR A MAMMAL, THEY ALL
###1076 START OUT AS AN EARLY ZYGOTE. SIMILAR PATTERNS OF
###1081 DIVISION AND THEN BECOME SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT. AND THEN
###1084 DURING SOME STAGE OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT YOU CAN SEE
###1087 A SORT OF COMMON STRUCTURE. THEY CONVERGE AGAIN ON
###1091 A COMMON APPEARANCE WHICH IS SOMETIMES CALLED THE
###1099 
###1106 FERTILIZED TO GIVE YOU ZYGOTE.
###1113 THIS DEVELOPS AND THEN
###1114 THIS PARTICULAR STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, THE SAME IS TRUE
###1120 OF INSECTS, YOU LOOK WITHIN GROUPS OF INSECTS AND
###1124 ACROSS VERTEBRATES. THIS PARTICULAR STAGE OF
###1127 DEVELOPMENT, SO CALLED PHYLOTYPIC STAGE, THEY ALL LOOK
###1134 REALLY, REALLY SIMILAR. THEN I DIVERGE TO GIVE RISE
###1140 TO THE, THROUGH BIRTH, THE JUVENILE THEN TO THE ADULT.
###1148 THERE IS A STAGE WHERE YOU CAN SEE VERY COMMON
###1151 APPEARANCES AND STRUCTURES.
###1152 NOW, IF WE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE STAGES,
###1158 PARTICULAR PHYLOTYPIC STAGE, WHERE ALL THESE THINGS
###1161 THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT IN THE ADULT FORM LOOK VERY
###1163 SIMILAR AS EMBRYOS, YOU CAN SEE PARTICULAR STRUCTURES,
###1168 THAT AS THEY DEVELOP FURTHER, TAKE ON VERY DIFFERENT
###1171 FUNCTIONS. THE EXAMPLE I HAVE GIVEN YOU HERE IN THE
###1174 COMPARING A CHICKEN AND A HUMAN EMBRYO IS THE
###1176 PHARYNGEAL POUCHES.
###1194 THE
###1194 VERTEBRATE EMBRYOS. IN FISH, THAT GOES ON TO FORM THE
###1200 GILLS. YOU JUST FOLLOW THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE BY STAGE
###1203 BY STAGE. IN MAMMALS, IT IS GOING TO TURN A DIFFERENT
###1208 FUNCTION. IT IS NOW FORMING PART OF THE STRUCTURE OF
###1215 THE EARS AND THE THROAT. REALLY DIFFERENT STRUCTURE
###1222 IN THE ADULT FORM BUT THEY HAVE A COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL
###1226 STAGE IN THESE PHARYNGEAL POUCHES. SO JUST A FEW
###1231 WEEKS AGO PEOPLE SORT OF WONDERED WHY DO YOU START
###1235 FROM A EGG THEN BECOME DIFFERENT AND SIMILAR AGAIN AT
###1238 THIS STAGE AND THEN BECOME DIFFERENT AGAIN? AND JUST
###1241 A FEW WEEKS AGO IN NATURE THERE WAS A SERIES OF
###1245 STUDIES WHERE THEY TOOK EMBRYOS AT EVERY STAGE OF
###1249 DEVELOPMENT. ONE GROUP DID IT IN VERTEBRATES, IN
###1251 ZEBRA FISH AND RELATIVES AND ANOTHER GROUP DID IT IN
###1254 DROSOPHILA OR FLIES. AND THEY FOUND THAT THE
###1258 PHYLOTYPIC STAGE THESE THINGS LOOK SIMILAR, MOST OF
###1262 THE GENES THAT WERE EXPRESSED AT THIS STAGE, GENES
###1267 
###1269 LINEAGE, ANCESTRAL GENES IF YOU LIKE. THIS IS WHERE
###1274 WE ARE GETTING ANCESTRAL GENES EXPRESSED. AS YOU
###1283 BECOME MORE AND MORE DIFFERENT LATER IN DEVELOPMENT
###1286 YOU ARE GETTING NEWLY ARISEN NOVEL GENES BEING
###1289 EXPRESSED. WE CAN UNDERSTAND THIS BY LOOKING TO
###1292 PHYLOGENY OF THE GENES. WHICH GENES WERE PRESENT AND
###1296 HAVE COMMON FUNCTION WAY BACK IN THE COMMON ANCESTOR
###1300 OF ALL OF THE VERTEBRATES OF A COMMON ANCESTOR OF
###1302 INSECTS. THE OTHER ONES THAT ARE EXPRESSED AT THIS
###1304 STAGE WHERE YOU GET SIMILAR STRUCTURES SORT OF MAKES
###1307 SENSE. ONLY RECENTLY WE HAVE GOTTEN THE DIRECT
###1309 EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT. WE ARE GETTING AN IDEA OF
###1313 MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIES THESE OBSERVATIONS THAT HAVE
###1316 BEEN MADE IN EMBRYOLOGY FOR 100 OR MORE YEARS. PRETTY
###1322 COOL.
###1323 OKAY. WHAT ELSE HAVE I GOT THERE. THE NEXT
###1329 SLIDE, SLIDE 6, AGAIN I WON'T DRAW IT OUT, IS
###1333 
###1337 ABOUT HOW INHERITANCE WORKED AND DNA. DIDN'T KNOW
###1341 ABOUT DEVELOPMENTAL PATHWAYS OF GENES. YET, THE
###1345 THEORY OF EVOLUTION THAT HE AND WALLACE PUT FORWARD
###1349 EXPLAINS A LOT OF NEW KNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE GETTING
###1352 FROM MOLECULAR BIOLOGY. OF THE SIMPLEST, THE GENETIC
###1355 CODE. THE WAY WE TRANSLATE FROM THE DNA SEQUENCE TO
###1360 AMINO ACIDS AND A PROTEIN IS IN COMMON ACROSS THE
###1364 EUKARYOTICS, PLANTS AND FUNGI AND ANIMALS. IT IS
###1369 COMMON BECAUSE THEY AROSE FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR.
###1371 EVEN BETTER YOU CAN LOOK AT THE ARRANGEMENT OF GENES
###1379 IN PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS. YOU SEE THE
###1384 ARRANGEMENT OF GENES AND THEIR PATTERN OF EXPRESSION
###1387 IN THE EARLY EMBRYO IS THE SAME BETWEEN DROSOPHILA AND
###1390 MOUSE. YOU CAN TAKE ONE OF THESE GENES OUT OF MOUSE
###1394 AND RECOVER A MUTATION IN DROSOPHILA. SO THESE ARE
###1399 GENES THAT ARE DORSAL OR VENTRAL PATTERNING, THAT IS,
###1402 PICKING OUT WHICH PART OF THE EMBRYO WILL BE THE
###1405 
###1407 IT IS THE SAME DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAM WITH SOME
###1410 MODIFICATIONS IN INSECTS AS IT IS IN VERTEBRATES IN
###1415 MICE. YOU CAN SEE THAT WHEN YOU SEQUENCE THE DNA.
###1419 DARWIN DIDN'T USE THIS AS EVIDENCE BECAUSE HE HAD NO
###1421 CLUE ABOUT THIS. AS WE HAVE GONE ON GETTING MORE AND
###1425 MORE FROM DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY AND SO FORTH, AGAIN,
###1428 IT ALL MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF THESE IDEAS OF
###1431 HOMOLOGIES AND MODIFICATION AND SO ON. IT JUST GETS
###1435 BETTER AND BETTER.
###1436 SO PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT THE THEORY OF
###1439 EVOLUTION. JUST A THEORY. JUST SOMEONE'S CRAZY IDEA.
###1442 THE MARK OF A THEORY THAT WORKS IS AS YOU ACCUMULATE
###1447 MORE AND MORE EVIDENCE THAT EXPLAINS MORE AND MORE
###1449 THINGS. AND PEOPLE TEST IT CRITICALLY AND WE ARE
###1454 STILL REFINING THE DETAILS BUT THE THEORY ITSELF IS
###1458 HELD UP SIMPLY AS THE BEST IDEA IN BIOLOGY. IT
###1461 EXPLAINS MOST OF ANY POSSIBLE THEORY. OKAY.
###1468 SOAP
###1469 BOX AGAIN. I AM STARTING TO WAKE UP YOU SEE. LET'S
###1474 MOVE ON TO THIS IDEA OF THE TREE OF LIFE. THIS
###1479 CONCEPT OF HOMOLOGIES IS GOING TO COME UP AGAIN AND
###1481 AGAIN AS WE SEE WHAT IS THE TREE OF LIFE AND HOW DO WE
###1485 ESTIMATE IT AND HOW DO SCIENTISTS GO ABOUT
###1489 UNDERSTANDING THE TREE OF LIFE. WHAT WE ARE GOING TO
###1515 TALK ABOUT IS ESTIMATING A PHYLOGENY
###1524 AND THE BRANCH OF
###1525 SCIENCE THAT DOES THIS IS CALLED SYSTEMATICS.
###1533 DISCOVERING SPECIES ALL RELATED BACK INTO THIS LARGER
###1537 TREE OF LIFE. WHEN I WAS A LAD, WHICH WASN'T SO LONG
###1545 AGO, REALLY JUST A FEW WEEKS, WE THOUGHT THERE WAS
###1550 SORT OF THE PROKARYOTES, SINGLE CELLED ORGANISMS WITH
###1559 NO INTERNAL ORGANELLES AND SO FORTH. AND THEN THE
###1564 EUKARYOTES FOR THE ORGANISMS WITH INTRACELLULAR
###1575 ORGANELLES, MITOCHONDRIA, CHLOROPLASTS, ENCLOSED
###1579 NUCLEUS, ALL THAT STUFF. AND THEN WE SPLIT THEM OUT
###1583 INTO MAJOR GROUPS OF PLANTS, FUNGI, ANIMALS, SINGLE
###1596 
###1600 WERE PRETTY SMART. WE THOUGH THAT WE HAD IT NAILED.
###1604 THIS SCHEME GOES WAY, WAY BACK TO LINNAEUS. TURNS OUT
###1610 WE ARE DEAD WRONG. MOST PEOPLE STARTED SEQUENCING
###1615 HOMOLOGOUS GENES FROM ACROSS ALL OF LIFE. THEN
###1620 DISCOVERED WE HAVE THIS TOTALLY WRONG. TURNS OUT
###1624 THERE WERE 3 MAJOR DOMAINS OF LIFE. ONE IN
###1628 EUKARYOTES, WE GO THE THAT RIGHTS. PROKARYOTES WERE
###1633 SPLIT INTO TWO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT GROUPS. THE
###1640 ARCHAEA AND THE EUBACTERIA. AN EXAMPLE OF EUBACTERIA
###1651 IS E. COLI. IT IS INSIDE ALL OF YOU. IT IS HUMAN
###1656 COMMENSAL. AN EXAMPLE OF ARCHAEA'S ARE FIRMUS
###1661 AQUATICUS. ANYONE EVER DONE PCR? ANY OF YOU AT THIS
###1666 STAGE? THIS SO-CALLED TEC ENZYME THAT YOU USE AND
###1670 WHICH WORKS AT VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES. THE FIRMUS
###1674 AQUATICUS, THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF ARCHAEA THAT COMES
###1676 FROM, TO US AT LEAST, TO AN EXTREME ENVIRONMENT. IT
###1680 WAS ISOLATED FROM THE HOT SPRINGS AT YELLOWSTONE IN
###1683 
###1685 BIO-CHEMICAL PROCESSES. SO THESE ARCHAEA HAVE TURNED
###1689 UP IN A LOT OF, TO HUMANS, EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS. TURNS
###1695 OUT THEY WERE A RELATED GROUP VERY DISTINCT FROM
###1698 EUBACTERIA. SO THOSE THREE DIVISIONS SHOWN ON THE
###1705 LOWER LEFT, YOU CAN GET THIS NEST OF PATTERN SO WITHIN
###1711 THE EUCARYA, YOU HAVE PLANT, ANIMAL, FUNGI AND THEN
###1718 YOU HAVE SINGLE CELL, ANIMALS TO PROTISTS. THEY ARE
###1725 NOT A NATURAL GROUPING. THEN YOU SORT OF GO IN
###1728 FURTHER WITHIN THE TREE OF LIFE, HEADING UP TOWARDS
###1731 THE TIPS YOU COME TO THE (INAUDIBLE) YOU GO IN FURTHER
###1735 YOU COME TO THE VERTEBRATES AND YOU GO ON FURTHER YOU
###1737 COME TO THE MAMMALS YOU GO IN FURTHER COME TO PRIMATES
###1740 GO IN FURTHER COME TO HUMANS. (INAUDIBLE) IS ONE
###1744 LITTLE MISERABLE TWIG ON THE TREE OF LIFE. THINK ABOUT
###1750 THAT.
###1753 AGAIN, THESE FIGURES COME DIRECTLY FROM THE
###1754 UNDERSTANDING OF EVOLUTION WEBSITE. COOL RESOURCES
###1759 OF LIFE.
###1761 WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE USE, WE DON'T JUST MAKE THIS STUFF
###1764 UP, HOW DO WE COME TO SOME HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THE TREE
###1769 OF LIFE? IT IS ALL ABOUT DEVELOPING AND TESTING
###1772 HYPOTHESIS. WHAT IS THE SORT OF EVIDENCE THAT WE CAN
###1775 BRING TO BEAR. SO, IN GENERAL THERE ARE TWO MAIN
###1781 CLASSES OF EVIDENCE. MORPHOLOGY AND MOLECULES.
###1793 MORPHOLOGY WAS THE MAIN SOURCE OF EVIDENCE BACK
###1795 IN DARWIN'S DAY. AND NOW THAT WE CAN SEQUENCE DNA
###1800 EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY, MOLECULES COME IN AND
###1803 THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT.
###1810 WE CAN STUDY BOTH FOSSILS AND THE LIVING OR
###1815 EXTANT SPECIES. SO, FOSSILS WE CAN GET MORPHOLOGY.
###1822 NO PROBLEM. EXTANT FORMS WE CAN GET MORPHOLOGY AND WE
###1828 CAN ALSO SEQUENCE MOLECULES FROM THE LIVING TAXA. IN
###1833 SOME CASES FOR FAIRLY RECENT FOSSILS AND RECENTLY
###1839 EXTINCT FORMS WE CAN ALSO GET MOLECULAR DATA. IN
###1845 FACT, WHOLE GENOMES. THAT IS, REALLY TECHNOLOGY HAS
###1850 
###1854 THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR MORE THAN A MILLION OR
###1857 SO YEARS.
###1858 SO EACH OF THESE ALSO BRINGS SOME ADDITIONAL
###1862 INFORMATION. AGAIN, WITH THE FOSSILS, WE CAN GET AT
###1867 ANCESTORS. WE CAN LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE ANCESTORS
###1872 GOING BACK ON THIS TREE OF LIFE, IF WE HAVE ENOUGH
###1875 FOSSIL EVIDENCE, AND LOOK AT THE CHARACTERISTIC THEY
###1878 HAVE PARTICULARLY FOR MORPHOLOGY. IT ALSO GIVES US
###1883 SOME ESTIMATE OF TIME. WHEN DID THOSE ANCESTOR'S
###1888 EXIST FOR THE COMMON TAXA. SO WHEN WAS THE COMMON
###1892 ANCESTOR FOR HUMAN AND CHIMPANZEE. WITHOUT FOSSILS WE
###1896 CAN'T REALLY NAIL THAT DOWN AND THERE IS A BIG GROUP
###1899 OF PEOPLE HERE WHO WORK ON THAT.
###1903 FOR THE EXTANT TAXA, WE CAN AS I WILL EXPLAIN A
###1906 LITTLE BIT LATER, WE CAN ALSO GET AN ESTIMATE OF TIME
###1910 AS WELL AS RELATIONSHIPS. BUT, WE CAN'T DIRECTLY SEE
###1913 THE ANCESTORS. BUT WE NEED THE FOSSILS TO DO THAT.
###1917 
###1920 LINES OF EVIDENCE. NOW, I NEED TO INTRODUCE YOU TO
###1924 SOME PRINCIPLES AND TERMINOLOGY THAT WILL COME UP IN
###1927 YOUR LAB.
###1927 THERE CAN BE A LOT OF WORDS BANDIED ABOUT. SO
###1935 THE PRINCIPLES ARE FIRST, THAT WE, OUR HYPOTHESIS OF
###1945 PHYLOGENY IS BASES ON SHARED, DERIVED CHARACTERS. I
###1949 WILL EXPLAIN WHAT THIS IS IN A MINUTE. WE USE SHARED,
###1957 DERIVED STATES OF CHARACTERS TO GROUP TAXA. WE WILL
###1964 SEE AN EXAMPLE IN A MINUTE. DON'T PANIC. SECOND
###1969 PRINCIPLE IS THAT WE SHOULD GROUP FORMS INTO SPECIES
###1975 OR GENERA OR CLADES THAT ARE MONOPHYLETIC.
###1978 SO WHAT THE HELL IS THAT I HEAR YOU ASK?
###1990 DID I HEAR YOU ASK? GOOD. VERY GOOD. OKAY.
###1995 SO LET'S LOOK AT A DIAGRAM. THESE ARE STATES NOT
###2002 STATICS. MY WRITING IS TERRIBLE. SO, LET'S DRAW A
###2007 PHYLOGENY. I WILL REFER TO SLIDE NUMBER 9. THIS IS
###2012 ALSO IN YOUR TEXT BOOK.
###2016 BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT TO BE EASIER FOR WHAT I WANT TO
###2018 DO.
###2018 SO HERE WE HAVE THE LIMITED FORM. J AND K.
###2026 THEY HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR. I.
###2032 OVER HERE WE HAVE GOT SOME MORE LIVING FORMS G,
###2040 H, G, E AND D. THESE GUYS HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR
###2046 CALLED C. THIS ONE HAS A COMMON ANCESTOR CALLED F.
###2049 HERE YOU HAVE COMMON ANCESTOR CALLED B. IT WILL ALL
###2052 MAKE SENSE IN A MINUTE. COMMON ANCESTOR THERE CALLED
###2055 A.
###2059 REMEMBER TO START, WE DON'T KNOW THIS GENEALOGY.
###2062 WE DON'T KNOW THIS HISTORY. BUT WE WILL START AS IF
###2065 WE DO KNOW IT AND WORK BACKWARDS TO EXPLAIN WHAT I
###2068 MEAN BY A SHARED DERIVED STATE OR MONOPHYLETIC. SAY
###2075 YOU HAVE A CHANGE IN THE MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTIC.
###2078 HERE, IT GOES FROM STATE A TO STATE B. SO THESE ARE
###2089 ALL TAXA SPECIES GENERA, WHATEVER LEVEL YOU ARE
###2094 
###2094 A, B AND C ARE STATES FOR A PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTIC.
###2108 PRESENCE OF NAILS, EVOLUTION OF LIMBS, WHATEVER. THEY
###2113 ARE HOMOLOGOUS. DIFFERENT STATES OF THE HOMOLOGOUS
###2118 CHARACTERISTIC. SO, GOING BACK TO VERTEBRATE, YOU
###2122 HAVE GOT A FLIPPER, YOU HAVE GOT A WING, YOU HAVE GOT
###2126 A LEG, A FOREARM, AND SO ON. THEY ARE ALL STATES OF
###2131 THAT HOMOLOGOUS CHARACTERISTIC WHICH IS A VERTEBRATE
###2136 FOUR LIMB. SO HERE, YOU HAVE GONE FROM STATE A, WHICH
###2140 IS ANCESTRRAL FORM AND ANCESTRAL STATE TO STATE B THAT
###2144 IS A SHARED DERIVED CHARACTERISTIC BECAUSE ALL OF
###2147 THESE FORMS, LET ME FINISH THE DIAGRAM BECAUSE IT WILL
###2154 GET A LITTLE MORE CONFUSING. HERE WE ARE GOING TO
###2158 CHANGE B TO C. SO WE LOOK ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT
###2163 CHARACTERISTICS, WHAT WE ACTUALLY SEE IS A. LET'S TRY
###2170 TO GET THIS RIGHT; B, B, C, C. THAT IS WHAT WE
###2175 OBSERVE. NOT JUST ONE CHARACTERISTIC BUT HUNDREDS.
###2187 SO, IN THIS CASE B AND C ARE SHARED, DERIVED
###2196 TWO AND C
###2196 IS SHARED BETWEEN THESE TWO. BUT, IF WE HAVE FOSSILS
###2200 WE CAN SEE THAT A TURNED TO B BACK HERE AND B TURNED
###2204 TO C HERE. THESE ARE SHARED DERIVED STATES.
###2212 JUST TO COMPLICATE THINGS FURTHER BECAUSE I LOVE
###2215 COMPLEXITY. IMAGINE UP HERE YOU HAVE A INDEPENDENTLY
###2222 GIVE RISE TO THE STATE C. LET'S CALL IT C STAR. IT
###2230 IS NOT REALLY THE SAME THING. IT JUST LOOKS LIKE IT.
###2234 SO, IN THIS CASE A B AND C ARE THE SHARED, DERIVED
###2239 STATE. THEY ARE HOMOLOGOUS. C STAR IS ANALAGOUS.
###2244 ARISEN QUITE INDEPENDENTLY IN EVOLUTION. SO, INSTEAD
###2250 OF SHARED, DERIVED STATE, IT MAY LOOK LIKE IT BUT, IF
###2255 YOU LOOK AT ENOUGH CHARACTERISTICS YOU SEE THIS
###2258 ARRANGEMENT COMING OUT IN COMMON SO THEN YOU KNOW THAT
###2261 IN FACT J IS NOT RELATED TO THESE. IN FACT IT IS
###2266 RELATED TO K THEN YOU CAN BACK OUT AND THEN YOU SEE
###2270 THIS ONE IS HAS RISEN INDEPENDENTLY. SO THE IDEA HERE
###2273 OF HOMOLOGOUS CHARACTERS, SHARED, DERIVED STATES AND
###2278 
###2280 CHARACTERISTICS THE TRUE HISTORY. WE ARE ESTIMATING.
###2285 IT IS A HYPOTHESIS.
###2286 AGAIN, WE WILL LOOK AT SOME EXAMPLES OF THIS IN
###2293 A MINUTE. I WANT TO INTRODUCE TO A COUPLE MORE TERMS.
###2296 SO, A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP IS A GROUP OF TAXA THAT
###2301 CONTAINS ALL OF THE DESCENDENTS FROM A PARTICULAR
###2303 COMMON ANCESTOR. SO, D AND E IS A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP.
###2311 THESE HAVE COMMON ANCESTOR C AND THE GROUP INCLUDES
###2315 ALL OF THE LIVING DESCENDANTS FROM THAT GROUP. THIS
###2323 IS A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. H, G, D, AND E ALL HAVE A
###2327 COMMON ANCESTOR B BACK HERE. AND THAT GROUP CONTAINS
###2332 ALL OF THE DESCENDANTS FROM THAT COMMON ANCESTOR. IF
###2336 YOU LIKE, THIS IS MONOPHYLETIC GROUPS. NOW THERE ARE
###2344 OTHER COMBINATIONS OF TAXA YOU CAN IMAGINE HERE THAT
###2348 DOESN'T HOLD TRUE. SO, IMAGINE IF YOU HAD TO, MAKE
###2352 SURE IT IS SAME AS THE SLIDE, IMAGINE YOU HAD THIS
###2357 GROUP OF TAXA. H G AND E. THAT IS NOT A MONOPHYLETIC
###2368 IS CALLED
###2368 A PARAPHYLETIC GROUP. THEY HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR,
###2376 BUT THAT GROUPING DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL OF THE OF
###2379 PERCENTAGE FROM THE COMMON ANCESTOR.
###2386 YOU CAN ALSO
###2386 IMAGINE ANOTHER GROUPING HERE OF THIS PLUS D AND E. J
###2394 K E AND D DON'T HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE COMMON ANCESTOR.
###2403 THIS WHOLE GROUP HAS A COMMON ANCESTOR BACK HERE BUT
###2406 IF YOU JUST GROUP THESE SPECIES YOU ARE EMITTING THESE
###2409 TWO WHICH HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR. THIS IS CALLED
###2412 POLYPHYLETIC.
###2420 AS J AND K HAVE ARISEN INDEPENDENTLY OF
###2422 A AND D. THE HISTORY OF LIFE. BELIEVE ME I AM BEING
###2429 GENTLE. A LOT OF THIS FIELD WAS INVENTED BY GERMANS
###2432 AND THERE IS A REALLY HORRENDOUS SET OF TERMINOLOGY
###2435 THAT GOES WITH IT. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE
###2439 PRINCIPLE THAT TAXA, SPECIES, GENERA, FAMILIES, SHOULD
###2443 BE MONOPHYLETIC. THAT IS WHAT I MEAN HERE. GROUPING
###2447 OF TAXA SHOULD INCLUDE ALL OF THE DESCENDANTS FROM THE
###2450 COMMON ANCESTOR. AND WE DEFINE THEM BY THE PRESENCE
###2453 
###2460 LET'S LOOK AT A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES AND I WILL
###2462 STOP AND TAKE QUESTIONS. I THINK EXAMPLES, THIS IS A
###2465 VERY ABSTRACT KIND OF, EXAMPLES MIGHT HELP MAKE IT
###2469 MORE TANGIBLE. SLIDE 10, I WILL NOT DRAW THIS ON THE
###2475 BOARD, WE HAVE THE ESTIMATED PHYLOGENY OF MAJOR GROUPS
###2482 OF VERTEBRATES OR IS THAT CHORDATES?
###2492 WE HAVE THE
###2494 OUTSIDE OF THE GROUP HISTORY OF, WE HAVE THE NEXT
###2498 LETTER WHICH IS CALLED THE OUT-GROUP. IN THIS CASE IT
###2505 IS A CHORDATE, THE LANCELET. THEN WE HAVE THE
###2511 DIFFERENT MAJOR GROUPS OF VERTEBRATES; WE HAVE GOT THE
###2514 LAMPREY, THE FISH, AMPHIBIANS, REPTILES AND MAMMALS.
###2521 BIRDS, BY THE WAY, ARE JUST FLYING REPTILES. THEY ARE
###2526 NOT A SEPARATE GROUP AS WAS LONG THOUGHT. WHAT IS
###2531 SHOWN HERE ON THE LEFT IS A CHARACTER MATRIX. SO FOR
###2537 A PARTICULAR SET OF CHARACTERISTICS, I SHOULD HAVE
###2540 PRINTED THIS LARGER, HINGED JAWS, WALKING LEGS, HAIR
###2545 AND SO ON, SHOWS WHERE THOSE PARTICULAR TRAITS ARE
###2551 
###2555 PHYLOGENY WHICH SHOWS YOU THE CHARACTER STATE THAT
###2558 UNITE GROUPS OR CLADES. HERE IS ANOTHER TERM. WE
###2565 CALL THESE GROUPINGS CLADES. MONOPHYLETIC CLADES.
###2570 THE CLADE IS A GROUP OF TAXA. YOU CAN SEE, AS YOU GO
###2576 THROUGH THAT, THAT ALL OF THE VERTEBRATES SHARE A
###2582 VERTEBRAL COLUMN. THAT IS A SHARED DERIVED
###2586 CHARACTERISTIC STATE, IF YOU LIKE, THAT DEFINES ALL OF
###2591 THE VERTEBRATES. THE NEXT GROUPING IN, THE BONY FISH
###2594 AND THE REST HAVE HINGED JAWS. SHARED, DERIVED STATE
###2599 OF JAWS.
###2602 THE TETRAPODS, THE AMPHIBIANS, THE BIRDS, THE
###2604 MAMMALS AND REPTILES, ALL HAVE FOUR LIMBED LEGS. THAT
###2611 IS WHY THEY ARE CALLED TETRAPODS. REPTILES INCLUDING,
###2617 BIRDS AND MAMMALS ALL HAVE AN AMNIOTIC EGG. MAMMALS
###2625 ALL SHARE THE CHARACTERISTIC OF HAIR WHICH IS MODIFIED
###2630 IN OTHER ORGANISMS, THAT IS SCALES. IN MAMMALS IT IS
###2635 HAIR. A SHARED DERIVED STATE. OKAY. SO, THESE
###2644 BUT, I
###2645 WANTED YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE TERMINOLOGY AS WELL AS
###2648 THESE MAJOR PRINCIPLES. SO, WE CAN ESTIMATE PHYLOGENY
###2654 GIVEN NOT JUST THIS MISERABLE 4 OR 5 CHARACTERS BUT
###2658 HUNDREDS OF THEM. CONSIDERING THE DEVELOPMENTAL
###2663 PATHWAYS AND THE FOSSIL RECORD TO IDENTIFY HOMOLOGOUS
###2666 RESTRUCTURE, HOMOLOGOUS AND SHARED ANCESTORS AND
###2671 FINDING TRANSITIONAL STATES, AND SO ON. OTHER EVIDENCE
###2675 THAT HAS COME TO THE FLOOR, IS DNA SEQUENCE VARIATION.
###2680 HOW DO WE TREAT THAT?
###2683 DNA SEQUENCES. SO WE CAN TAKE THE PARTICULAR
###2702 GENE, THE SAME GENE ACROSS ALL VERTEBRATES, ACROSS ALL
###2707 OF LIFE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE RIBOSOMAL RNA GENES THAT
###2713 ENCODE PART OF THE RIBOSOME THAT IS IN ALL OF THE
###2716 CELLS OF THE ORGANISMS, CAN BE SEQUENCED ACROSS ALL OF
###2719 LIFE. OF COURSE, THERE ARE 4 DIFFERENT NUCLEOTIDES IN
###2725 THE DNA.
###2725 A T C AND G. ADENINE, THYMINE, CYTOSINE,
###2737 SO THEY
###2738 HAVE A SEQUENCE AT A T A C G. IN A PARTICULAR
###2744 ORGANISM WE SEQUENCE THAT SAME PART OF THE GENE FROM
###2748 A DIFFERENT ORGANISM, A T C C G T. WE LINE THESE
###2756 SEQUENCES UP SO THAT ALL OF THE POSITIONS CORRESPOND.
###2759 THAT IS THIS IS A HOMOLOGOUS BASE WITHIN THAT GENE.
###2764 IT IS THE SAME BASE POSITION IN ALL OF THESE TAXA. SO
###2767 IN THIS CASE, THIS IS NOT VERY FORMED THAT THESE TWO
###2770 HAVE THE SAME STATE. BUT SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE
###2775 HISTORY OF LIFE THERE HAS BEEN A MUTATION AND YOU CAN
###2778 FIGURE OUT WHICH WAY BY SEQUENCING THE OUT-GROUP
###2781 SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF THAT. HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. SO
###2785 THESE ARE DIFFERENT STATES OF THAT BASE POSITION IN
###2790 THAT GENE.
###2793 SO SLIDE 11 SHOWS YOU A MATRIX, JUST A MADE UP
###2797 ONE. SO ACROSS THE TOP IS THIS BASICALLY, JUST A FEW
###2802 MORE LINES OF THIS STUFF ACROSS DIFFERENT SPECIES.
###2806 AND THEN YOU SEE THE STATES IN THE GENE. AND ON THE
###2810 
###2813 CHARACTERISTICS AND MANY OTHERS. YOU CAN DO THIS FOR
###2817 WHOLE GENOMES NOW, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF BASE PAIRS
###2821 IN GENES.
###2824 SO, HOW DO WE ESTIMATE THAT TREE IN THERE ARE
###2826 TWO METHODS THAT ARE IN USE. A LOT OF THIS IS
###2831 ACTUALLY DEVELOPED BY, WE HAVE SOME OF THE WORLD
###2836 LEADERS IN DEVELOPING THIS STUFF HERE. PARTICULARITY
###2838 JOHN HUELSONBECK AND OTHER PEOPLE. JOHN HAS SHOWN ON
###2845 THIS SLIDE THAT THERE ARE TWO BASIC PROCESSES. REASON
###2848 I PUT JOHN HERE, HE TEACHES BIO 1B IN THE FALL. I
###2851 TEACH IT IN THE SPRING. KIND OF FUN. BASICALLY, TWO
###2859 DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO ANALYZING THIS DATA TO
###2862 ESTIMATE THE PHYLOGENETIC TREE. ONE IS THE PRINCIPLE
###2865 OF PARSIMONY. ACROSS ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
###2869 CHARACTERS AND STATES WE WANT TO ESTIMATE THE
###2872 RELATIONSHIPS THAT MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF EVOLUTION
###2875 THAT YOU NEED TO PROPOSE. SO, BASICALLY YOU MINIMIZE
###2882 
###2888 MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS ACROSS THAT SORT OF TAXA. SO
###2892 THE TREE THAT HAS THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF EVOLUTION ON
###2896 IT IS THE FAVORED TREE. IT IS THE SIMPLEST
###2898 EXPLANATION OF THE DATA. WE ALWAYS TRY TO HAVE THE
###2902 SIMPLEST EXPLANATION. THAT IS WHY IT IS CALLED
###2907 PARSIMONY. SIMPLEST POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF THE DATA.
###2909 THERE ARE COMPUTER PROGRAMS THAT DO THIS. YOU
###2912 WILL WORK THROUGH SOME EXAMPLES IN YOUR LAB. THE
###2916 OTHER APPROACH IS MORE STATISTICAL.
###2923 WHERE WE HAVE THE
###2924 SAME GENERAL AIM OF TRYING TO FIND THE TREE THAT BEST
###2927 EXPLAINS THE DATA, BUT WE BRING INTO IT, PARTICULARLY
###2932 FOR DNA SEQUENCES, WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE MODEL OF
###2935 SEQUENCE EVOLUTION. HOW DOES THE MUTATION PROCESS
###2937 WORK? SOME TYPES OF MUTATION THAT ARE MORE COMMON BY
###2942 CHEMICALLY THAN OTHER TYPES OF MUTATIONS. HERE WE
###2945 BRING IN AND TRY TO MINIMIZE CHANGE, BUT ALSO BRING IN
###2949 A STATISTICAL MODEL OF HOW SEQUENCES EVOLVE. AND YOU
###2958 
###2962 COMMON AND THEN APPLY THAT KNOWLEDGE TO IMPROVE YOUR
###2965 ESTIMATE OF RELATIONSHIPS. A VERY SIMPLE WAY TO DO
###2970 THIS IS JUST TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE THERE IS
###2972 IN A GENE. IS THERE 1 PERCENT DIFFERENT, 20 PERCENT
###2977 DIFFERENT, 30 PERCENT DIFFERENCE IN ALL OF THE
###2979 PAIRWISE COMBINATIONS OF GENES. YOU MIGHT TRY TO
###2983 ESTIMATE THE TREE WHICH ONE HAS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF
###2985 CHANGE GIVEN THE MODEL OF SEQUENCE EVOLUTION. THIS IS
###2991 SOPHISTICATED STATISTICAL SCIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, AT
###2993 THE BOTTOM OF SLIDE 12 ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THERE IS
###2997 A TREE SHOWING SOMETHING THAT IS IMPLAUSIBLE. IT IS A
###3000 POOR EXPLANATION OF THE DATA BECAUSE THE BRANCH
###3002 LENGTHS ARE ALL SKEWED. THEY ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.
###3006 SO, IN THAT CASE, JOHN HUELSENBECK, SHOWN IN THE
###3008 PHOTOGRAPH, IS MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO A PLANT. BEST
###3013 ESTIMATE OF PHYLOGENY IS THAT JOHN HUELSENBECK IS MOST
###3016 CLOSELY RELATED TO A FUNGUS WITH THE PLANT BEING THE
###3020 
###3025 HEULSENBECK. TO FINISH UP I WANT TO COME BACK TO THIS
###3034 QUESTION OF TIME. HOW CAN WE ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF
###3038 MAJOR EVENTS IN EVOLUTION? AS I HAVE SAID, WE CAN DO
###3041 IT FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD IF WE CAN FIND THE
###3045 TRANSITION INTERMEDIATE FORM AND COMMON ANCESTORS BACK
###3048 IN THE RECORD AND DATE THAT PERIOD IN THE ROCKS IN THE
###3051 ROCK RECORD AND WE CAN GET A DIRECT ESTIMATE OF THE
###3057 COMMON ANCESTOR, WHEN WAS THAT COMMON ANCESTOR
###3060 PRESENT? WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. THE
###3064 OTHER APPROACH IS SO-CALLED MOLECULAR CLOCK. WHICH IS
###3075 THE IDEA THAT THESE MUTATIONS IN GENES BECOME
###3079 ESTABLISHED AND ACCUMULATE IN THE ROUGHLY TIMED
###3083 INDEPENDENT MANNER. IF YOU HAD A FOSSIL RECORD AND
###3087 YOU KNEW THAT THE DIVERSION HISTORIES, THIS AXIS IS
###3095 TIME AND THIS AXIS IS DIVERGENCE, AND THIS IS HOW
###3102 DIFFERENT THE TWO GENES ARE, MOLECULAR CHANGE IS
###3107 ACCUMULATED ROUGHLY, IT IS NOT A PERFECT LINE, SORT OF
###3111 
###3118 SO IF YOU HAVE A TREE WHERE, JUST ABOUT DONE, IF YOU
###3121 HAVE A TREE WHERE THIS IS TIME COMING THIS WAY, AND
###3130 YOU CAN FIX A COUPLE OF POINTS FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD,
###3133 LET'S SAY YOU KNOW, YOU CAN ESTIMATE WHEN THAT COMMON
###3138 ANCESTOR WAS FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD, YOU CAN CALIBRATE
###3142 THIS CLOCK AND ESTIMATE THE SLOPE OF THIS LINE FROM
###3146 SAY, IMAGINE YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE HERE AND A FEW
###3149 OTHERS, THAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT OF DIVERGENCE OF THAT
###3152 GENE. HOW FAST DO ACCUMULATES CHANGE. THEN YOU CAN
###3156 LOOK AT MOLECULAR TREE AND ESTIMATE TIME FOR THESE
###3161 OTHER BRANCHES BASES ON YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THESE. IF
###3165 MOLECULAR EVOLUTION IS APPROXIMATELY CLOCK-LIKE AND
###3169 ROUGHLY FOLLOWS THIS RULE, AND THIS WAS DEVELOPED BY
###3173 ZUCKERKANDLE WHO WAS A PROFESSOR HERE AND NOW IS THE
###3177 BASIS FOR A LOT OF TIMING OF EVOLUTIONARY EVENTS. WE
###3181 WILL LEAVE IT THERE HAVE A NICE WEEKEND STAY DRY, SEE
###3185 YOU MONDAY.
