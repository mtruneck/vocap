###5 HAMILTON MORRIS: Dearest Krystle, I cannot express the
###9 excitement within me when I think that shortly we will
###12 meet face to face.
###13 
###16 Over the years, I've read your books and watched your videos,
###20 perused court documents, police records, and
###23 affidavits, yet I still feel confused about what happened
###26 between you, Todd, and the LSD laboratory so many years ago.
###33 I hope that when we are together, I will finally
###36 understand what transpired, and the truth will shine
###39 brightly as a crystal in the Kansas sky.
###42 
###45 Much love, Hamilton.
###48 
###57 Krystle Cole is one of the most unlikely figures in the
###60 psychedelic community.
###62 A Goth stripper from Kansas whose introduction to the
###65 psychedelic underground came in February of 2000, when she
###69 fell deeply in love with a mysterious man named Todd, who
###73 was the heir to a spring manufacturing fortune.
###77 She quit her job as a dancer and moved in with Todd at a
###80 decommissioned nuclear missile silo that served as his
###83 private pleasure of lysergic delights.
###86 
###89 Exactly what happened in that laboratory at the dawn of the
###91 new millennium is still a subject of heated debate.
###95 But it is known that Todd formed a partnership with
###98 Leonard Pickard, an accomplished clandestine
###101 psychedelic chemist.
###102 And together they began to assemble what would have been
###105 the world's largest LSD lab.
###108 But before the lab could be put into full operation, it
###111 was destroyed by the DEA.
###115 After verifying that my intentions were pure, Krystle
###118 agreed to meet with me to discuss her involvement in the
###121 lab and take me on a guided tour of the subterranean LSD
###125 palace that she once called home.
###129 
###139 Last night we flew into Kansas City, and right now we're on
###143 our way to meet Krystle Cole.
###147 Outside of what she's written in her book, Lysergic, and her
###149 numerous YouTube videos, there's very
###151 little known about her.
###152 I have a lot of questions.
###154 I've wanted to meet her for a long time.
###156 
###162 Here we are.
###163 
###166 Hey, what's going on?
###167 It's Hamilton.
###169 Nice to meet you.
###171 KRYSTLE COLE: I was raised in a small Kansas town, which is
###173 comparable to being sucked into a spiritual black hole.
###176 I was surrounded by flat, bleak cornfields farmed by
###180 similarly flat, bleak people.
###182 At a young age, my classmates labeled me as a nerd, causing
###185 me to never quite fit in.
###186 The first thing that comes to mind upon reflection is, thank
###189 god for being an outcast.
###191 My peers were the perfect example of white
###193 trash at its worst.
###194 The majority of them had already given birth to a
###196 couple children and dropped out of high
###198 school because of it.
###200 No aspirations existed in their minds beyond the next
###202 round of incestuous sex, six-pack of
###205 beer, and line of meth.
###207 HAMILTON MORRIS: Krystle is one of very few people
###209 surrounding the bust who is not currently incarcerated.
###212 And in the wake of extraordinary heartbreak,
###215 trials, and prison sentences, she used her life experience
###219 to inspire a variety of informational YouTube videos
###223 that have garnered much attention across the internet.
###226 KRYSTLE COLE: So this is the green screen that I use to
###229 shoot all the NeuroSoup videos.
###231 So I came up with the name NeuroSoup because it's
###234 basically the combination of neurology and then the soup,
###238 we all have this soup of different neurotransmitters in
###240 our brains.
###241 And so drugs affect these neurotransmitters, and so
###244 that's kind of how I came up with the name NeuroSoup.
###247 HAMILTON MORRIS: Mm.
###248 You were saying that your most popular YouTube video is the
###251 Shamanic Colonic anal DMT video.
###254 -Hi.
###254 Some people have gotten onto the NeuroSoup forum and asked
###258 me about the time that I took DMT anally.
###260 And so today I want to describe that for you guys.
###263 There are some benefits to it.
###265 I've only done it anally once, because I guess the negative
###268 side effect to it, while I'm talking about all the
###270 positives, is that it burned really bad, and it just kind
###273 of put me in this weird head space.
###276 KRYSTLE COLE: That was my most popular one until YouTube
###278 forced me to remove it because of its new community content
###281 guidelines.
###282 There's some other paintings and more
###285 paintings and more fractals.
###287 I kind of have them on the walls everywhere.
###289 And of course, Grateful Dead bears.
###293 That one is the one that I put on my first edition of
###296 Lysergic book cover.
###297 It's my favorite one.
###298 And the language around the side of it are things that I
###300 kind of saw when I was tripping, these
###302 alienesque-type languages.
###304 I don't know what you would call it.
###306 HAMILTON MORRIS: Can you talk about just the things you talk
###308 about the beginning of Lysergic, how you initially
###311 got involved in all of this?
###313 KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah, well, I met Todd at a strip club.
###315 I worked there for about three months.
###319 And he came in--
###320 well, actually, one of his employees came
###322 in and saw me first.
###323 And then they went back, and they said, oh, there's this
###325 girl down there you should see, kind of thing.
###327 So then he came and met me.
###328 And shortly thereafter, I was driving one of his Porsches
###332 and living at his missile site.
###335 HAMILTON MORRIS: I asked Krystle to take me on a tour
###337 of the silo, which is now owned by a vintage tank
###340 enthusiast.
###342 It will be the first time Krystle has entered the silo
###345 since her romance with Todd.
###348 When Todd was seducing you, what kinds of
###350 things would he say?
###352 KRYSTLE COLE: Oh, boy.
###353 I don't know.
###355 Um, at first he was very gentlemanly.
###359 It wasn't like he was drugging me and taking
###360 advantage or anything.
###361 At first he was being the utmost gentleman, to try to
###364 win my trust over.
###367 HAMILTON MORRIS: On the way, we passed the place Krystle
###369 and Todd first met--
###371 Club Orleans, one of Topeka's premier exotic dance
###375 establishments.
###377 KRYSTLE COLE: This was the club that I met Todd, although
###378 it was a different name back then.
###380 They've kind of remodeled since then.
###382 I did kind of an interesting act.
###384 I did a bondage act.
###386 And so I--
###387 really stood out for the Kansas crowd that's in there.
###390 I would play death metal music, and I had this, like,
###393 chain that I would hold around my neck with a dog collar.
###395 I'd wrap it around the pole and stuff, and I'd
###397 whip myself on stage.
###398 
###401 I was really into Goth back then.
###402 Because I really hated Kansas, and I was just rebelling
###405 against everything that this whole place was about.
###408 And so he comes in there.
###409 He was sort of like the mad scientist.
###412 If you can imagine, like, a guy walking around with this
###415 big metal briefcase, you know, bald--
###418 and his hair, like, what hair is left sticking up
###420 everywhere.
###422 His clothes rattered, tattered everywhere.
###425 He would come in there and just sit with me and pay me
###428 like lots and lots of money just to hang out in the VIP
###432 room with him.
###432 And he would sit there for the whole day.
###434 And we did that for a couple of times.
###435 And then he's like, well, why don't you just come out to
###438 where I live, and stuff?
###439 And I was like, well, OK.
###440 I'll go out to your place with you.
###442 They have a policy where you're not supposed to leave
###444 with customers.
###444 You're not supposed to do that.
###445 And I never would have done that, but Todd was so
###448 persuasive.
###450 And so, I kind of gave in.
###453 I probably shouldn't have.
###454 If I wouldn't have met him, I wouldn't have had all this
###456 horrible stuff happen.
###457 But I also wouldn't have had all the cool stuff happen.
###459 He drove Porsches and had lots of money.
###462 And, you know, he bought me Armani clothes and gave me
###465 money, and I didn't have to work at
###466 the strip club anymore.
###467 So I was like, hey, let's party.
###469 I didn't care.
###470 
###472 I'm kind of excited to see what it looks like in there.
###476 I think it's going to bring back a lot of memories.
###479 HAMILTON MORRIS: As we drew near the legendary missile
###481 silo, I tried to imagine Krystle arriving here with
###485 Todd for the very first time.
###488 KRYSTLE COLE: You used to have to call in using this system
###490 right there, or you'd have an access code.
###493 HAMILTON MORRIS: Upon entering this silo, Krystle left the
###496 spiritual black hole of Kansas behind forever and was
###500 introduced to Todd and Leonard's underground ring of
###503 chemists, dealers, and drug enforcement agents.
###509 KRYSTLE COLE: These tunnels are really fun when you're
###511 tripping, because they'll start swirling on you and
###514 you'll be, like, hanging on, like, ahh!
###516 
###520 HAMILTON MORRIS: And what was your experience with drugs
###522 before having met Gordon "Todd" Skinner?
###526 KRYSTLE COLE: Virtually none.
###527 Of course, I did the normal drinking alcohol, smoking pot.
###532 I tried meth twice and I did coke once.
###535 But other than that--
###536 I'd never even heard of MDMA.
###537 I didn't even know what it was.
###539 All I know is, he's like, it'll make you feel good.
###541 Just try it.
###542 You like it.
###542 Don't worry.
###542 You'll like it.
###544 And boy, did I.
###546 Back then, I was on so many different substances.
###550 It was like living in an entheogenic monastery, because
###553 I didn't have to work.
###553 I didn't have to worry about paying bills.
###555 I didn't have to do anything other than use psychedelics
###560 and pray to the god that we all share.
###562 
###565 The whole situation was centered around tripping, so
###568 we just wanted to be comfortable.
###569 This here is the missile bay.
###572 About where the tanks are is where we had a platform set up
###575 with a stereo, and we would have a couple of king-sized
###578 beds in here and a bunch of different couches, like
###581 leather couches and things.
###582 That way we could hang out and have plenty of places to sit
###585 down and lay down or whatever.
###588 HAMILTON MORRIS: Todd spent money with wild abandon,
###591 decorating the silo with stone statues, Persian carpets,
###595 cedar saunas, a marble bathroom with a tub large
###599 enough to accommodate a half-dozen people, and a
###601 $120,000 stereo system, which he used to play both Sarah
###606 McLachlan and Deep Forest at extremely high volumes.
###610 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###625 KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah, we would all get in here and shower.
###627 There was lots of nudity.
###628 You can imagine, you know, lots of cute
###631 girls running around.
###633 And the parties were-- could get really wild.
###636 
###639 One of the things they really liked to do was have IVs set
###642 up and have some DMT or some 5-MeO in the IV bottle.
###645 They would sit there, and then they would like, crank it up
###648 so they'd start tripping more.
###649 And then they'd roll it down a little bit to kind of--
###651 and so you could, like-- he would like surf in the DMT
###654 high, you know?
###656 I would do a lot, but not that.
###659 Todd seemed like the most spiritual person
###661 you would ever meet.
###663 And when we would trip together, it was
###664 like, I don't know.
###666 Tripping with him is different than tripping with anyone I've
###669 ever tripped with, you know?
###670 And we experienced things like telepathy together, and you
###672 know, we experienced God, if you want to
###676 label it that, together.
###678 HAMILTON MORRIS: Krystle was exposed to a cornucopia of
###681 psychedelic substances, ranging from the more common
###684 chemicals like LSD, DMT, and MDMA to such rarities as
###690 ALD-52, ergot wine, a variety of fluorinated AMT analogs,
###696 and a mysterious substance made by
###698 Leonard called diazedine.
###703 Unbeknownst to Krystle, Todd and Leonard began to argue,
###707 and Todd was slowly overcome by fear of both Leonard and an
###711 impending bust by the DEA.
###715 KRYSTLE COLE: Todd was so secretive about everything.
###717 A couple weeks before the bust happened, he gave me some MDMA
###720 and said, go in the bedroom and trip and leave me alone.
###722 Don't come out here.
###723 So I was like, pretty high, and I came out there, and
###725 like, what are you doing?
###726 I'm bored.
###727 And so then I got to see all the stuff.
###729 He had pictures of Leonard and all this stuff about Leonard,
###732 like this huge file on him.
###733 Looking back on it, I should've known something was
###735 getting ready to come down when he had all that stuff
###737 out, because then I could have said, Leonard,
###738 you gotta watch out.
###740 KSNT REPORTER: Wamego residents say they were
###741 shocked when DEA agents arrived into town on November
###745 6, looking for drug fugitives.
###748 HAMILTON MORRIS: In October 2000, Todd formally contacted
###751 the DEA and declared that he would like to turn in the
###755 world's largest LSD manufacturing conspiracy.
###759 Todd received total immunity for his involvement with the
###762 laboratory and walked away a free man, while Leonard was
###765 chased by the DEA, outrunning them on foot and hiding in a
###768 barn with his body covered with cold leaves to evade
###772 thermal cameras.
###774 The following day, Leonard was turned in by a farmer and
###777 eventually given two concurrent life sentences
###780 without parole.
###784 MALE SPEAKER: Wamego Police Department were brought in to
###786 assist in the manhunt, which ended up being an 18-hour hunt
###790 for the individual.
###790 KSNT REPORTER: DEA agents believe the LSD lab is one of
###794 the largest in the world.
###796 HAMILTON MORRIS: After the bust, Krystle and Todd
###798 traveled across the country for three years with a small
###801 group of ravers and drug enthusiasts, selling
###804 phosphorescent capsules of MDMA and living like
###807 psychedelic royalty in Seattle,
###809 Mendocino, Tucson, and Tulsa.
###812 KRYSTLE COLE: Here's our California house.
###814 We had our own private beach down there.
###816 We would try to get the best we could everywhere.
###819 HAMILTON MORRIS: There were peacocks on the property?
###820 KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah.
###821 Yeah.
###821 There were peacocks on the property.
###823 You would think having peacocks would be
###824 cool, but it wasn't.
###827 Outside of our houses was all these Amanitas.
###828 And so we would go pick Amanitas and stuff.
###830 You can see us, we're identifying them and
###832 researching them.
###833 Some of these don't have Todd in them, because he didn't let
###836 us take a lot of pictures.
###837 There towards the end, I think all the stress of the court
###840 case, and everything, you know, the years of running,
###842 and the years of all the problems, you know, just
###844 really were piling in on him.
###846 And I think that he was just kind of going
###848 a little bit crazy.
###850 Todd was very much escalating things.
###853 He started abusing me, like literally
###857 physically abusing me.
###858 I was willing to look over some of the bad stuff that I
###860 started to see the first couple years, because, oh, I
###864 know underneath all this, it's just the stress.
###866 It's just temporary.
###867 Underneath all that, he's this beautiful, spiritual person.
###870 And he's doing all this for good reasons.
###872 And now looking back on it, no, he was just
###875 manipulating me.
###876 I was--
###877 I was just a stupid girl.
###880 You know?
###881 He always had a couple of other girlfriends, and I
###883 always had boyfriends.
###885 And we were each other's primary, you know, I mean, but
###887 like we always had other people around.
###889 And so the boyfriend at the time, Brad, he was the first
###893 guy over the years that I dated that wanted-- that said,
###897 look, this situation's no good.
###898 You need to get away from this.
###899 And so, so I'm like, OK, well, the only way for us to get out
###902 of this is for us to go to the DEA and basically do what Todd
###906 did to Leonard to Todd.
###908 And so we go to the DEA together, and we basically
###912 spill everything about Todd's local operation that he's got
###915 going there.
###916 They were already familiar with the Pickard case and all
###919 that stuff.
###920 And so they knew who I was, that I was Todd's girlfriend
###922 and all that.
###923 They had a case.
###924 They had me.
###924 They had the boyfriend.
###926 And I told them where one of his labs was.
###927 So they had more than enough of a case, and more than
###930 enough of a reason to go after him.
###931 You know what they said to me?
###932 They're like, well, we'll give you a call.
###933 And I'm like, OK.
###934 And so they had my phone number.
###935 So I go home.
###936 And then conveniently, two days later, Todd called me up.
###939 Well, I know you went into the DEA.
###940 HAMILTON MORRIS: So you went into the DEA.
###941 You told them that he was dangerous.
###943 They took down all the information.
###946 Didn't do anything at all to stop him.
###948 But told him that you had reported him and just
###951 infuriated him?
###953 KRYSTLE COLE: Yes.
###953 And that is why he kidnapped me and Brad and did the things
###957 that he did to us.
###958 HAMILTON MORRIS: On the 4th of July, 2003, believing he was
###962 immune to legal prosecution, Todd lured Krystle and Brad to
###966 the Tulsa Doubletree Inn.
###969 Shortly after meeting, Todd offered Brad a communion wafer
###972 laced with an unknown psilocin analog.
###975 KRYSTLE COLE: The next thing I know, he's duct-taped up, and
###977 they were injecting him with stuff.
###979 And they were telling me, you know, if you don't obey
###982 everything we say, we're going to give him something that's
###984 going to kill him.
###985 And we have to get information out of him.
###987 We have to know what he said.
###989 HAMILTON MORRIS: As the drug took effect, Todd taped Brad
###992 up and spent one week subjecting him to psychedelic
###995 tortures of unfathomable depravity.
###997 
###1001 KRYSTLE COLE: I know that he was giving him stuff like
###1004 barbiturates and things like Valium and stuff.
###1008 HAMILTON MORRIS: But he was using
###1008 psychedelics as a truth serum?
###1010 KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah.
###1010 And he was using psychedelics as well.
###1013 He was giving him IV DMT.
###1015 Any drug he had, he pretty much was giving it to him.
###1017 You know, and after that, after it was over, I had to
###1020 stay with Todd for a whole month.
###1021 And I mean, he drugged me, he raped me, he sodomized me, he
###1023 did horrible things to me.
###1024 It's hard for me to talk about, because I have PTSD now
###1027 because of what he did.
###1029 But I mean, it's horrendous.
###1031 I mean, to think that somebody would use psychedelics for the
###1033 kinds of things he used them for.
###1036 HAMILTON MORRIS: Todd fled to Burning Man, where he was
###1038 arrested for MDMA distribution and ultimately tried for
###1041 kidnapping and assault with a dangerous weapon.
###1045 For these acts, Todd was sentenced to life in prison.
###1049 
###1055 KRYSTLE COLE: Todd was so tall that he had to really watch
###1057 out for those things, or he would hit his head on them.
###1060 
###1063 KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah.
###1064 He has life, so you don't have to worry about him coming back
###1067 and haunting the place here.
###1069 Once you trip a lot, you can make any trip a pleasant
###1071 experience.
###1073 Unless the person's literally standing above you and
###1075 injecting you and strangling and threatening you and
###1078 yelling at you and stuff.
###1080 You can't-- there's no way to make that good.
###1084 The last few years have been a difficult road for me to walk
###1087 down, yet they have made me a much better person.
###1090 I got so far out of touch with a normal person's reality.
###1093 For years, I never worked a job, watched television, or
###1096 even went a week without being around someone
###1098 who was on an entheogen.
###1099 I basically had to start life all over.
###1102 I began watching the news to get up to speed on current
###1104 events, got an apartment of my own, and started a business to
###1108 support myself.
###1109 I feel like even after four years, I'm still working on
###1112 reintegrating into society.
###1115 In the spirit of actually doing something with what I've
###1117 learned through entheogens, I founded a nonprofit website
###1120 called NeuroSoup.com.
###1121 My hope is that it will be a place for people to learn,
###1124 share their beliefs about spirituality, entheogens, and
###1127 themselves.
###1128 Namaste.
###1129 
###1132 HAMILTON MORRIS: After everything that has
###1133 transpired, Krystle still considers Todd
###1136 the love of her life.
###1139 We are all brothers in the family of humanity, and life
###1143 is a cosmic giggle on the breath of the universe.
###1148 Namaste.
###1149
