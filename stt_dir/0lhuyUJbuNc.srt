STEVE SPANGLER: So I bet you
think this is the part of the


3
0:0:1,48 --> 0:0:3,15
show where I'm going to
say, don't try these


4
0:0:3,15 --> 0:0:4,77
experiments at home.


5
0:0:4,77 --> 0:0:5,61
And you're right.


6
0:0:5,61 --> 0:0:8,15
Except there is one experiment
we want you to try.


7
0:0:8,15 --> 0:0:9,64
Just look for the graphic
that's right here


8
0:0:9,64 --> 0:0:10,82
that says try it.


9
0:0:10,82 --> 0:0:12,7
That's your signal that
you can try that


10
0:0:12,7 --> 0:0:13,72
experiment at home.


11
0:0:13,72 --> 0:0:15,345
Everything else, off limits.


12
0:0:15,345 --> 0:0:15,68
Look.


13
0:0:15,68 --> 0:0:17,303
I've already given you homework,
and the show hasn't


14
0:0:17,303 --> 0:0:17,956
even started.


15
0:0:17,956 --> 0:0:26,218
[MUSIC PLAYING]


16
0:0:26,218 --> 0:0:29,9
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm fascinated
with Newton's cradle.


17
0:0:29,9 --> 0:0:32,479
But then, again, I'm
easily amused.


18
0:0:32,479 --> 0:0:36,74
It's the coolest demonstration
toy because it teaches the


19
0:0:36,74 --> 0:0:39,3
laws of conservation
of momentum and the


20
0:0:39,3 --> 0:0:42,18
conservation of energy.


21
0:0:42,18 --> 0:0:44,2
Pendulums are just cool.


22
0:0:44,2 --> 0:0:46,65
As much as we'd like to think
that Isaac Newton sat around


23
0:0:46,65 --> 0:0:48,61
and played with this toy, it
was actually invented by an


24
0:0:48,61 --> 0:0:53,26
English actor by the name of
Simon Prebble in 1967.


25
0:0:53,26 --> 0:0:56,21
He named it after Newton
because it demonstrates


26
0:0:56,21 --> 0:0:58,59
Newton's laws of motion.


27
0:0:58,59 --> 0:1:0,64
What I'm really looking
for is, instead


28
0:1:0,64 --> 0:1:2,47
of making it bigger--


29
0:1:2,47 --> 0:1:3,53
that seems to be what everybody
wants to do


30
0:1:3,53 --> 0:1:5,57
nowadays, is to do
it with something


31
0:1:5,57 --> 0:1:6,99
that's bigger and bigger.


32
0:1:6,99 --> 0:1:11,44
I remember, years ago, there was
a science experiment in a


33
0:1:11,44 --> 0:1:14,41
book called, Scientific
Amusements that talked about


34
0:1:14,41 --> 0:1:18,76
the swing and the transfer of
energy from a pendulum.


35
0:1:18,76 --> 0:1:21,36
It almost looked like
mind control.


36
0:1:21,36 --> 0:1:24,44
That's what I think I want to
do is to mess with people in


37
0:1:24,44 --> 0:1:26,81
our office today and see if I
can convince them that I can


38
0:1:26,81 --> 0:1:30,55
control or they can control an
object with just their mind.


39
0:1:30,55 --> 0:1:34,5
When in fact, it's all cleverly
disguised here in the


40
0:1:34,5 --> 0:1:36,426
swing of a pendulum.


41
0:1:36,426 --> 0:1:40,496
For now, I'm going to keep
playing with this.


42
0:1:40,496 --> 0:1:42,492
[MUSIC PLAYING]


43
0:1:42,492 --> 0:1:45,16
STEVE SPANGLER: You know, they
say the old is forever new.


44
0:1:45,16 --> 0:1:46,3
And it's absolutely right.


45
0:1:46,3 --> 0:1:47,66
If you want inspiration,
you turn to some


46
0:1:47,66 --> 0:1:49,14
of these old books.


47
0:1:49,14 --> 0:1:54,37
This is Scientific Amusements,
about 1870 or so, adapted from


48
0:1:54,37 --> 0:1:56,94
Professor CG Knott.


49
0:1:56,94 --> 0:1:58,96
What I'm looking at here is, as
you're thumbing through it,


50
0:1:58,96 --> 0:2:0,72
there are all these
old materials.


51
0:2:0,72 --> 0:2:2,95
But I remember this thing called
a coupled pendulum.


52
0:2:2,95 --> 0:2:5,68
It was actually a swinging
pendulum.


53
0:2:5,68 --> 0:2:7,34
You can see here that
they actually used


54
0:2:7,34 --> 0:2:9,4
eggs for some reason.


55
0:2:9,4 --> 0:2:11,52
And the eggs would swing
back and forth.


56
0:2:11,52 --> 0:2:14,84
I want to build this because, if
you do it right, you can't


57
0:2:14,84 --> 0:2:17,17
really see the science behind
it, the secret.


58
0:2:17,17 --> 0:2:19,55
And you can make somebody think
that they're actually


59
0:2:19,55 --> 0:2:21,71
controlling an object
with their mind.


60
0:2:21,71 --> 0:2:23,15
We'll just use some modern
day materials, and


61
0:2:23,15 --> 0:2:24,3
we should be set.


62
0:2:24,3 --> 0:2:24,99
[MUSIC PLAYING]


63
0:2:24,99 --> 0:2:26,4
STEVE SPANGLER: All right,
here's everything you're going


64
0:2:26,4 --> 0:2:29,98
to need, using simple
household materials.


65
0:2:29,98 --> 0:2:31,25
We're going to start
with this cord.


66
0:2:31,25 --> 0:2:35,14
And it calls for about 36
inches, so about 100


67
0:2:35,14 --> 0:2:37,98
centimeters of the cord here.


68
0:2:37,98 --> 0:2:39,9
So that will be our
main piece.


69
0:2:39,9 --> 0:2:42,455
And then the two pendulum pieces
that are going to hang


70
0:2:42,455 --> 0:2:44,55
down have to be exactly equal.


71
0:2:44,55 --> 0:2:46,67
And so, in this particular case,
we're going to go for


72
0:2:46,67 --> 0:2:50,8
about 60 centimeters, which is
approximately 24 inches.


73
0:2:50,8 --> 0:2:53,38
And all of this is going to have
to be tweaked a little


74
0:2:53,38 --> 0:2:55,62
bit, I think, as
we're doing it.


75
0:2:55,62 --> 0:3:1,7
But we just want pieces that are
identical in every way, so


76
0:3:1,7 --> 0:3:5,57
that the pendulum, when it
swings back and forth, the


77
0:3:5,57 --> 0:3:7,23
energy from one is the same.


78
0:3:7,23 --> 0:3:8,98
And we transfer it to the
other one as well.


79
0:3:8,98 --> 0:3:10,95
So we have to keep absolutely
everything the same.


80
0:3:10,95 --> 0:3:12,51
So we need those two pieces.


81
0:3:12,51 --> 0:3:16,53
And now, instead of hanging
something like a jewel or


82
0:3:16,53 --> 0:3:18,78
something ornate, I thought
just these soda


83
0:3:18,78 --> 0:3:19,86
cans would be fine.


84
0:3:19,86 --> 0:3:22,5
And I can't just do the soda
cans, so I emptied them out,


85
0:3:22,5 --> 0:3:24,21
washed them out and added
the same amount of


86
0:3:24,21 --> 0:3:25,43
water to each one.


87
0:3:25,43 --> 0:3:30,15
So we're looking at about 175
milliliters in each one.


88
0:3:30,15 --> 0:3:31,3
It doesn't really matter.


89
0:3:31,3 --> 0:3:33,35
I'm just showing you what I'm
doing for this if you're


90
0:3:33,35 --> 0:3:36,13
trying to replicate it exactly
the way that I'm doing it,


91
0:3:36,13 --> 0:3:37,5
hoping that it works.


92
0:3:37,5 --> 0:3:38,43
So that's the set up.


93
0:3:38,43 --> 0:3:40,22
Now we just have to tie
everything together and see if


94
0:3:40,22 --> 0:3:42,74
we can get this system
in place.


95
0:3:42,74 --> 0:3:45,536



96
0:3:45,536 --> 0:3:46,94
There you go.


97
0:3:46,94 --> 0:3:50,165
So I just need to make sure that
the cord is the same on


98
0:3:50,165 --> 0:3:56,26
this one as it is this one,
got it so this is in place


99
0:3:56,26 --> 0:4:3,4
here, and be sure that this one
looks exactly the same by


100
0:4:3,4 --> 0:4:8,102
using the same amount of cord,
so that will be perfect.


101
0:4:8,102 --> 0:4:9,38
OK?


102
0:4:9,38 --> 0:4:14,29
And now we need to tie both of
these onto this main one here.


103
0:4:14,29 --> 0:4:16,4
And I'm going to be able
to move them around.


104
0:4:16,4 --> 0:4:18,964
I just want to be able to put
some knots in them, so that


105
0:4:18,964 --> 0:4:23,32
the cord stays and that I'm,
again, using the same amount


106
0:4:23,32 --> 0:4:25,14
of cord on each one.


107
0:4:25,14 --> 0:4:31,87



108
0:4:31,87 --> 0:4:33,96
And now we just need to hook
them onto something.


109
0:4:33,96 --> 0:4:36,59
It has to be extremely steady,
because I don't want that


110
0:4:36,59 --> 0:4:37,61
other structure moving.


111
0:4:37,61 --> 0:4:40,62
So we're going to go tie it
around something or use these


112
0:4:40,62 --> 0:4:44,39
super strong magnets that we
have here to hold it in place.


113
0:4:44,39 --> 0:4:47,25
So I'll use these neodymium
magnets and


114
0:4:47,25 --> 0:4:47,84
put them on the ends.


115
0:4:47,84 --> 0:4:49,38
Hold them in place.


116
0:4:49,38 --> 0:4:50,77
And we should be set.


117
0:4:50,77 --> 0:4:52,39
Well, here's our pendulum
system, right?


118
0:4:52,39 --> 0:4:55,11
Both cans are equal
in their weight.


119
0:4:55,11 --> 0:4:57,55
The cords attached to the top
are equal in their length.


120
0:4:57,55 --> 0:4:59,47
And you can see how it's
attached up here,


121
0:4:59,47 --> 0:5:0,14
and it can't move.


122
0:5:0,14 --> 0:5:2,21
I'm just using these super
strong magnets


123
0:5:2,21 --> 0:5:3,6
to hold it in place.


124
0:5:3,6 --> 0:5:5,9
All right, so if we swing both
of them, it'd be just like


125
0:5:5,9 --> 0:5:7,83
swinging a kid at
the playground.


126
0:5:7,83 --> 0:5:9,65
It just moves back and forth.


127
0:5:9,65 --> 0:5:11,34
You know, when you push a kid
and you push him just at the


128
0:5:11,34 --> 0:5:14,5
right moment, you can add
some energy to it


129
0:5:14,5 --> 0:5:15,73
like we're doing here.


130
0:5:15,73 --> 0:5:17,36
Here's what we want to do with
this experiment, though.


131
0:5:17,36 --> 0:5:20,15
The book says that you
start with one can.


132
0:5:20,15 --> 0:5:22,3
So let's just say we
pick the Coke.


133
0:5:22,3 --> 0:5:22,65
You pull back.


134
0:5:22,65 --> 0:5:24,1
And you move the one can.


135
0:5:24,1 --> 0:5:26,81
As you start that in motion,
the energy is actually


136
0:5:26,81 --> 0:5:27,9
transferred to the other can.


137
0:5:27,9 --> 0:5:29,43
And now both of them
are in motion.


138
0:5:29,43 --> 0:5:31,33
But now you're supposed to focus
on the first one here.


139
0:5:31,33 --> 0:5:32,8
Focus on the Coke.


140
0:5:32,8 --> 0:5:34,83
You notice how it stops.


141
0:5:34,83 --> 0:5:36,35
And then it let's go.


142
0:5:36,35 --> 0:5:38,7
And now refocus your energy
to the Diet Coke.


143
0:5:38,7 --> 0:5:41,6
Look at this.


144
0:5:41,6 --> 0:5:41,84
And then it moves.


145
0:5:41,84 --> 0:5:44,66
So literally, these two
swinging bodies are


146
0:5:44,66 --> 0:5:47,56
transferring energy from
one to the next.


147
0:5:47,56 --> 0:5:49,62
So I think, if you do it
correctly, you might be able


148
0:5:49,62 --> 0:5:51,29
to convince somebody that
they could slow it


149
0:5:51,29 --> 0:5:52,6
down with their mind.


150
0:5:52,6 --> 0:5:52,42
Watch this.


151
0:5:52,42 --> 0:5:53,11
Slow it down.


152
0:5:53,11 --> 0:5:53,71
Slow it down.


153
0:5:53,71 --> 0:5:54,27
Slow it down.


154
0:5:54,27 --> 0:5:56,1
And it keeps moving.


155
0:5:56,1 --> 0:5:57,55
So it's really good,
after the first or


156
0:5:57,55 --> 0:5:58,7
second one that's there.


157
0:5:58,7 --> 0:6:2,19
Transfer your energy
over to the Coke.


158
0:6:2,19 --> 0:6:3,5
It's pretty cool.


159
0:6:3,5 --> 0:6:5,44
Regardless if you can fool your
friends or not, it's a


160
0:6:5,44 --> 0:6:9,55
very, very cool pendulum kind of
trick with the transfer of


161
0:6:9,55 --> 0:6:11,32
energy from one pendulum
to the next.
