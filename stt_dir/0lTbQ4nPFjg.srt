1
0:0:5,8 --> 0:0:22,0
All across the immense reaches of time and
space, energy is being exchanged, transferred,


2
0:0:22,0 --> 0:0:35,69
released, in a great cosmic pinball game we
call our universe.


3
0:0:35,69 --> 0:0:43,519
To see how energy stitches the cosmos together,
and how we fit within it, we now journey through


4
0:0:43,519 --> 0:0:57,11
the cosmic power scales of the universe, from
atoms nearly frozen to stillness.


5
0:0:57,11 --> 0:1:12,73
To Earths largest explosions. From stars colliding,
exploding, to distant centers of power so


6
0:1:12,73 --> 0:1:38,35
strange, and violent, they challenge our imaginations.
Today, energy is very much on our minds, as


7
0:1:38,35 --> 0:1:43,73
we search for ways to power our civilization
and serve the needs of our citizens.


8
0:1:43,73 --> 0:1:54,159
But what is energy? Where does it come from?
And where do we stand within the great power


9
0:1:54,159 --> 0:1:56,78
streams that shape time and space?


10
0:1:56,78 --> 0:2:7,1
Energy comes from a Greek word for activity
or working. In physics, it is simply the property


11
0:2:7,1 --> 0:2:18,23
or the state of anything in our universe that
allows it to do work. Whether it is thermal,


12
0:2:18,23 --> 0:2:34,83
kinetic, electro-magnetic, chemical, or gravitational.


13
0:2:34,83 --> 0:2:40,5
The 19th century German scientist Hermann
von Helmholtz found that all forms of energy


14
0:2:40,5 --> 0:2:49,63
are equivalent, that one form can be transformed
into any other. The laws of physics say that


15
0:2:49,63 --> 0:2:57,43
in a closed system - such as our universe
 - energy is conserved. It may be converted,


16
0:2:57,43 --> 0:3:6,58
concentrated, or dissipated, but it is never
lost.


17
0:3:6,58 --> 0:3:12,72
James Prescott Joule built an apparatus that
demonstrated this principle. It had a weight


18
0:3:12,72 --> 0:3:18,38
that descended into water and caused a paddle
to rotate. He showed that the gravitational


19
0:3:18,38 --> 0:3:23,86
energy lost by the weight is equivalent to
heat gained by the water from friction with


20
0:3:23,86 --> 0:3:24,33
the paddle.


21
0:3:24,33 --> 0:3:32,739
That led to one of several basic energy yardsticks,
called a joule. Its the amount needed to lift


22
0:3:32,739 --> 0:3:39,68
an apple weighing 100 grams one meter against
the pull of Earth's gravity.


23
0:3:39,68 --> 0:3:46,34
In case you were wondering, it takes about
one hundred joules to send a tweet, so tweeted


24
0:3:46,34 --> 0:3:50,849
a tech from Twitter.


25
0:3:50,849 --> 0:3:55,849
The metabolism of an average sized person,
going about their day, generates about 100


26
0:3:55,849 --> 0:4:5,92
joules a second, or 100 watts, the equivalent
of a 100-watt light bulb. In vigorous exercise,


27
0:4:5,92 --> 0:4:12,349
the power output of the body goes up by a
factor of ten, one order of magnitude, to


28
0:4:12,349 --> 0:4:19,39
around a thousand joules per second, or a
thousand watts.


29
0:4:19,39 --> 0:4:25,689
In a series of leaps, by additional factors
of ten, we can explore the full energy spectrum


30
0:4:25,689 --> 0:4:34,52
of the universe. So far, the coldest place
observed in nature is the Boomerang Nebula.


31
0:4:34,52 --> 0:4:41,659
Here, a dying star ejected its outer layers
into space at 600,000 kilometers per hour.


32
0:4:41,659 --> 0:4:47,229
As the expanding clouds of gas became more
diffuse, they cooled so dramatically that


33
0:4:47,229 --> 0:4:52,36
their molecules fell to just one degree above
Absolute Zero, one degree above the total


34
0:4:52,36 --> 0:4:59,68
absence of heat. That is around a billion
trillionths of a joule, give or take.


35
0:4:59,68 --> 0:5:5,349
That makes the signal sent by the Galileo
spacecraft, as it flew around Jupiter, seem


36
0:5:5,349 --> 0:5:12,999
positively hot. By the time it reached Earth,
its radio signal was down to 10 billion billionths


37
0:5:12,999 --> 0:5:18,83
of a watt. Now jump all the way to 150 billionths
of a watt.


38
0:5:18,83 --> 0:5:25,719
That is the amount of power entering the human
eye from a pair of 50-watt car headlamps a


39
0:5:25,719 --> 0:5:34,789
kilometer away. Moving up a full seven powers
of ten, moonlight striking a human face adds


40
0:5:34,789 --> 0:5:40,4
up to three hundred thousandths of a watt.
That is roughly equivalent to a crickets chirp.


41
0:5:40,4 --> 0:5:49,9
From there, it's a mere five powers of ten
to the low wattage world of everyday human


42
0:5:49,9 --> 0:5:51,52
technologies.


43
0:5:51,52 --> 0:6:0,58
Put ten 100-watt bulbs together. At 1000 joules
per second, 1000 watts, that roughly equals


44
0:6:0,58 --> 0:6:7,379
the energy of sunlight striking a square meter
of Earth's surface at noon on a clear day.


45
0:6:7,379 --> 0:6:16,399
Gather 200 bulbs. 20,000 watts is the energy
output of an automobile. A diesel locomotive:


46
0:6:16,399 --> 0:6:27,39
5 million watts. An advanced jet fighter:
75 million watts. An aircraft carrier: almost


47
0:6:27,39 --> 0:6:30,169
two hundred million watts.


48
0:6:30,169 --> 0:6:36,149
The most powerful human technologies today
function in the range of a billion to 10 billion


49
0:6:36,149 --> 0:6:48,229
watts, including large hydro-electric or nuclear
power plants. At the upper end of human technologies,


50
0:6:48,229 --> 0:6:56,8
was the awesome first stage of a Saturn V
rocket. In five separate engines, it consumed


51
0:6:56,8 --> 0:7:3,389
15 tons of fuel per second to generate 190
billion watts of power.


52
0:7:3,389 --> 0:7:18,29
How much power can humanity marshal? And how
much do we need?


53
0:7:18,29 --> 0:7:24,529
Long before the launch of the space age, visionaries
began to imagine what it would take to advance


54
0:7:24,529 --> 0:7:32,389
into the community of galactic civilizations.
In the 1960s, the Soviet scientist, Nicolai


55
0:7:32,389 --> 0:7:39,509
Kardashev, speculated that a Level 1 civilization
would acquire the technology needed to harness


56
0:7:39,509 --> 0:7:43,789
all the power available on a planet like Earth.


57
0:7:43,789 --> 0:7:51,129
According to one calculation, we are .16%
of the way there. This is based on British


58
0:7:51,129 --> 0:8:2,419
Petroleum's estimate of total world oil consumption,
some 11 billion tons in 2007. Humans today


59
0:8:2,419 --> 0:8:7,39
generate about two and a half trillion watts
of electrical power.


60
0:8:7,39 --> 0:8:16,8
How does that stack up to the power generated
by planet Earth? Deep inside our planet, the


61
0:8:16,8 --> 0:8:23,29
radioactive decay of elements such as uranium
and thorium generates 44 trillion watts of


62
0:8:23,29 --> 0:8:30,889
power. As this heat rises to the surface,
it drives the movement of Earths crustal plates,


63
0:8:30,889 --> 0:8:34,29
and powers volcanoes.


64
0:8:34,29 --> 0:8:39,75
Remarkably, that is just a fraction of the
energy released by a large hurricane in the


65
0:8:39,75 --> 0:8:51,3
form of rain. At the storms peak, it can rise
to 600 trillion watts. A hurricane draws upon


66
0:8:51,3 --> 0:8:54,24
solar heat collected in tropical oceans in
the summer.


67
0:8:54,24 --> 0:9:1,58
You have to jump another power of ten to reach
the estimated total heat flowing through Earths


68
0:9:1,58 --> 0:9:8,46
atmosphere and oceans from the equator to
the poles, and another two to get the power


69
0:9:8,46 --> 0:9:14,84
received by the Earth from the sun, at 174
quadrillion watts.


70
0:9:14,84 --> 0:9:26,59
Believe it or not, there's one human technology
that has exceeded this level. The AN602 hydrogen


71
0:9:26,59 --> 0:9:36,81
bomb was detonated by the Soviet Union on
October 30, 1961. It unleashed some 1400 times


72
0:9:36,81 --> 0:9:42,9
the combined power of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima
bombs.


73
0:9:42,9 --> 0:9:50,86
With a blast yield of up to 57 million tons
of TNT, it generated 5.3 trillion trillion


74
0:9:50,86 --> 0:10:0,25
watts, if only for a tiny fraction of a second.
That's 5.3 Yottawatts, a term that will come


75
0:10:0,25 --> 0:10:8,89
in handy as we now begin to ascend the power
scales of the universe.


76
0:10:8,89 --> 0:10:15,49
To Nikolai Kardashev, a Level 2 civilization
would achieve a constant energy output 80


77
0:10:15,49 --> 0:10:22,53
times higher than the Russian superbomb. That
is equivalent to the total luminosity of our


78
0:10:22,53 --> 0:10:29,41
sun, a medium-sized star that emits 375 yottawatts.


79
0:10:29,41 --> 0:10:35,82
However, in the grand scheme of things, our
sun is but a cold spark in a hot universe.


80
0:10:35,82 --> 0:10:45,72
Look up into Southern skies and you'll see
the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy


81
0:10:45,72 --> 0:10:55,25
of our Milky Way. Deep within is the brightest
star yet discovered. R136a1 is 10 million


82
0:10:55,25 --> 0:10:56,9
times brighter than the sun.


83
0:10:56,9 --> 0:11:8,26
Now if that star happened to go supernova,
at its peak, it would blast out photons with


84
0:11:8,26 --> 0:11:16,95
a luminosity of around 500 billion yottawatts.
To advance to a level three civilization,


85
0:11:16,95 --> 0:11:23,26
you have to marshal the power of an entire
galaxy.


86
0:11:23,26 --> 0:11:30,32
The Milky Way, with about two hundred billion
stars, has an estimated total luminosity of


87
0:11:30,32 --> 0:11:41,3
3 trillion yottawatts, a three followed by
36 zeros. The author Isaac Asimov imagined


88
0:11:41,3 --> 0:11:49,44
a galaxy-scale civilization in his Foundation
series. Galaxia, he called it, is a super-organism


89
0:11:49,44 --> 0:11:55,18
that surpasses time and space to draw upon
all the matter and energy in a galaxy.


90
0:11:55,18 --> 0:12:5,44
But who is to say that is the upper limit
for civilizations? To boldly go beyond Level


91
0:12:5,44 --> 0:12:15,63
3, a civilization would need to marshal the
power of a quasar. A quasar is about a thousand


92
0:12:15,63 --> 0:12:17,54
times brighter than our galaxy.


93
0:12:17,54 --> 0:12:24,97
Here is where cosmic power production enters
a whole new realm, based on the physics of


94
0:12:24,97 --> 0:12:30,1
extreme gravity.


95
0:12:30,1 --> 0:12:36,42
It was Isaac Newton who first defined gravity
as the force that pulls the apple down, and


96
0:12:36,42 --> 0:12:44,95
holds the earth in orbit around the sun. Albert
Einstein redefined it in his famous General


97
0:12:44,95 --> 0:12:51,36
Theory of Relativity. Gravity isn not simply
the attraction of objects like stars and planets,


98
0:12:51,36 --> 0:12:59,88
he said, but a distortion of space and time,
what he called space-time.


99
0:12:59,88 --> 0:13:5,72
If space-time is like a fabric, he said, gravity
is the warping of this fabric by a massive


100
0:13:5,72 --> 0:13:13,27
object like a star. A planet orbits a star
when it is caught in this warped space, like


101
0:13:13,27 --> 0:13:21,2
a ball spinning around a roulette wheel. Some
scientists began to wonder if matter became


102
0:13:21,2 --> 0:13:27,28
dense enough, could it warp space to such
an extreme that nothing could escape its gravity,


103
0:13:27,28 --> 0:13:28,24
not even light?


104
0:13:28,24 --> 0:13:35,91
With so much power being emitted from such
a small area, scientists suspected that quasars


105
0:13:35,91 --> 0:13:42,85
were actually being powered by black holes.
How a totally dark object can do this has


106
0:13:42,85 --> 0:13:46,6
been narrowed by decades of observations and
theory.


107
0:13:46,6 --> 0:13:56,87
If a black hole spins, it can turn into a
violent, cosmic tornado. Gas and stars begin


108
0:13:56,87 --> 0:14:3,18
to flow in along a rapidly rotating disk.
The spinning motion of this so-called "accretion


109
0:14:3,18 --> 0:14:8,76
disk" generates magnetic fields that twist
up and around.


110
0:14:8,76 --> 0:14:14,41
These fields can channel some of the inflowing
matter out into a pair of high-energy beams,


111
0:14:14,41 --> 0:14:21,88
or jets. Gas and dust nearby catch the brunt
of this energy, growing hot and bright enough


112
0:14:21,88 --> 0:14:24,42
to be seen billions of light years away.


113
0:14:24,42 --> 0:14:41,5
Amazingly, the power of a black hole can rise
to even greater extremes at the moment of


114
0:14:41,5 --> 0:14:59,56
its birth. As a giant star ages, heavy elements
like iron gradually build up in its core.


115
0:14:59,56 --> 0:15:5,43
As its gravity grows more intense, the star
begins to shrink, until it reaches a critical


116
0:15:5,43 --> 0:15:14,35
threshold. Its core literally collapses in
on itself.


117
0:15:14,35 --> 0:15:30,29
That causes the star to explode, in a supernova.
And now, in death, the star can unleash gravitys


118
0:15:30,29 --> 0:15:35,97
true fury.


119
0:15:35,97 --> 0:15:41,44
In the violence of the star's death, gravity
can cause its massive core to collapse to


120
0:15:41,44 --> 0:15:43,86
a point, forming a black hole.


121
0:15:43,86 --> 0:15:52,12
In some rare cases, the new-born monster powers
a jet that accelerates to within a tiny fraction


122
0:15:52,12 --> 0:16:1,17
of the speed of light. For a few minutes,
these so-called gamma ray bursts are known


123
0:16:1,17 --> 0:16:8,6
to be the brightest events since the big bang,
three orders of magnitude above a quasar at


124
0:16:8,6 --> 0:16:16,67
a billion billion yottawatts, a ten with 42
zeros.


125
0:16:16,67 --> 0:16:25,51
Remarkably, they are still not the most powerful
events known. Albert Einstein's equations


126
0:16:25,51 --> 0:16:32,15
contained an astonishing prediction, that
when massive bodies accelerate or whip around


127
0:16:32,15 --> 0:16:36,23
each other, they can stir up the normally
smooth fabric of space-time.


128
0:16:36,23 --> 0:16:49,18
They produce a series of waves that move outward
like ripples on a pond. Scientists are now


129
0:16:49,18 --> 0:16:55,9
hoping to detect these gravitational waves,
and verify Einsteins prediction, using precision


130
0:16:55,9 --> 0:17:2,49
lasers and some of the most perfect large-scale
vacuums ever created.


131
0:17:2,49 --> 0:17:8,72
At the Laser Interferometry Gravitational
Wave Observatory, known as LIGO, they are


132
0:17:8,72 --> 0:17:16,209
hoping to record the collision of ultra-dense
remnants of dead stars known as neutron stars


133
0:17:16,209 --> 0:17:19,419
and of black holes.


134
0:17:19,419 --> 0:17:25,779
According to computer simulations, as two
black holes spiral into a fateful embrace,


135
0:17:25,779 --> 0:17:32,44
the energy carried by each gravity wave rises
five orders of magnitude above a gamma ray


136
0:17:32,44 --> 0:17:43,379
burst to a hundred billion trillion times
the power of our sun.


137
0:17:43,379 --> 0:17:53,169
Does the collision of black holes define the
known power limits of our universe? Perhaps


138
0:17:53,169 --> 0:17:56,8
not.


139
0:17:56,8 --> 0:18:1,6
As turbulent as the environment of a black
hole might be, its true power may well lie


140
0:18:1,6 --> 0:18:12,129
deep in its core. A black holes mass is enshrouded
within a dark sphere called the event horizon.


141
0:18:12,129 --> 0:18:18,24
Since the 1920s, scientists have described
the mathematics of the event horizon as the


142
0:18:18,24 --> 0:18:25,649
equivalent of a waterfall. It's the point
of no return, beyond which water falls freely


143
0:18:25,649 --> 0:18:31,869
into the gorge.


144
0:18:31,869 --> 0:18:39,369
At the event horizon of a black hole, space
itself falls freely in at the speed of light.


145
0:18:39,369 --> 0:18:44,86
If the black hole is spinning, then the flow
spirals down and around an inner horizon that


146
0:18:44,86 --> 0:18:53,869
envelops the singularity. That's the central
region where space-time becomes infinitely


147
0:18:53,869 --> 0:18:56,19
warped.


148
0:18:56,19 --> 0:19:3,82
Any matter that rides this river of space
whips around the inner horizon so fast that


149
0:19:3,82 --> 0:19:10,46
centrifugal force tends to fling it back out.
As that happens, it collides with matter that's


150
0:19:10,46 --> 0:19:13,98
streaming in, whipping up a ferocious cosmic
storm.


151
0:19:13,98 --> 0:19:27,499
The energy of the colliding streams feeds
upon itself, rising to what may well be a


152
0:19:27,499 --> 0:19:40,39
limit imposed by nature. It dissipates only
as it falls into the singularity and disappears.


153
0:19:40,39 --> 0:19:46,799
Fortunately, for us, gravity walls off such
energy extremes behind the event horizon where


154
0:19:46,799 --> 0:19:56,84
they cannot affect the rest of the universe.


155
0:19:56,84 --> 0:20:5,49
And so here we sit. Our world is nestled within
a vast stream of cosmic energy, somewhere


156
0:20:5,49 --> 0:20:12,95
between the spin of an electron and the maelstrom
of a black hole.


157
0:20:12,95 --> 0:20:18,36
There's no telling whether a future Earth
civilization will be able harness enough energy


158
0:20:18,36 --> 0:20:21,739
to advance into the cosmos.


159
0:20:21,739 --> 0:20:28,299
For now, as we tap into the tiny morsels of
power at our disposal, we venture a closer


160
0:20:28,299 --> 0:22:28,299
look at a universe blazing with activity.
We are its product, and its star struck admirer.
