2
0:0:1,26 --> 0:0:2,5
CHRIS NIERATKO: Welcome.


3
0:0:2,5 --> 0:0:5,57
You're about to enter a new
dimension, to see things


4
0:0:5,57 --> 0:0:8,109
you've never experienced
before--


5
0:0:8,109 --> 0:0:13,55
two men with one face, in a
constant pursuit of pussy.


6
0:0:13,55 --> 0:0:16,76
Social norms completely
out the window.


7
0:0:16,76 --> 0:0:20,518
You are about to enter
into the twin zone.


8
0:0:20,518 --> 0:0:26,422
[HUMMING]


9
0:0:26,422 --> 0:0:30,86
[MUSIC]


10
0:0:30,86 --> 0:0:32,439
CHRIS NIERATKO: Allow me to
introduce you to Sydney and


11
0:0:32,439 --> 0:0:36,33
Thurman Sewell, AKA
the ATL twins.


12
0:0:36,33 --> 0:0:38,97
About a year and a half ago, I
was in Atlanta for a Red Bull


13
0:0:38,97 --> 0:0:41,66
skate tour for "Skateboarder
Magazine." My roommate and


14
0:0:41,66 --> 0:0:43,88
photographer, Jonathan Mehring,
said he had just met


15
0:0:43,88 --> 0:0:46,28
these gangster-ass twins who
sleep in the same bed, and


16
0:0:46,28 --> 0:0:47,625
only fuck the same girl.


17
0:0:47,625 --> 0:0:48,7
I pulled up my pants.


18
0:0:48,7 --> 0:0:51,47
And I told my roommate,
take me to them.


19
0:0:51,47 --> 0:0:53,76
The short of it is, they live
together in Atlanta in a high


20
0:0:53,76 --> 0:0:56,83
rise and share everything--
clothes, women.


21
0:0:56,83 --> 0:0:59,43
They were both engaged to the
same Penthouse pet, and are


22
0:0:59,43 --> 0:1:1,5
both looking forward to marrying
the same woman and


23
0:1:1,5 --> 0:1:2,58
fathering the same child.


24
0:1:2,58 --> 0:1:5,11
The long of it is that they're
the most unique twins I've


25
0:1:5,11 --> 0:1:8,5
ever come across, and are a
psychologist's wet dream.


26
0:1:8,5 --> 0:1:10,67
I interviewed them for vice.com
in a twin story so


27
0:1:10,67 --> 0:1:13,26
amazing, so unique, that it got
millions of page views in


28
0:1:13,26 --> 0:1:14,81
the first two days.


29
0:1:14,81 --> 0:1:16,97
Over the last year and change,
the twins have blown up.


30
0:1:16,97 --> 0:1:19,55
They modeled in a fashion shoot
for "Purple Magazine,"


31
0:1:19,55 --> 0:1:22,66
shot by Terry Richardson, made
the "Rolling Stones'" 2012 hot


32
0:1:22,66 --> 0:1:26,24
list, and now starring in
Harmony Korine's new movie,


33
0:1:26,24 --> 0:1:28,79
"Spring Breakers," where they
play drug dealers alongside


34
0:1:28,79 --> 0:1:29,94
James Franco.


35
0:1:29,94 --> 0:1:32,13
Judging from internet comment
boards, people love


36
0:1:32,13 --> 0:1:32,92
to hate on the twins.


37
0:1:32,92 --> 0:1:34,57
And some people doubt
they're even real.


38
0:1:34,57 --> 0:1:35,74
But I assure you, they are.


39
0:1:35,74 --> 0:1:38,23
And no one knows the full
story, until now.


40
0:1:38,23 --> 0:1:38,68
-Yeah.


41
0:1:38,68 --> 0:1:40,862
I'm walking to the courthouse
right now.


42
0:1:40,862 --> 0:1:42,79
CHRIS NIERATKO: They live
double lives, working as


43
0:1:42,79 --> 0:1:45,54
paralegals by day, and
gangster-ass Don Juans to


44
0:1:45,54 --> 0:1:48,8
Atlanta's singles scene
on a nightly basis.


45
0:1:48,8 --> 0:1:50,16
We've never seen the likes of
Sydney and Thurman Sewell.


46
0:1:50,16 --> 0:1:52,78
And I doubt the world
is ready.


47
0:1:52,78 --> 0:1:55,51



48
0:1:55,51 --> 0:1:58,52
We are in Hotlanta.


49
0:1:58,52 --> 0:2:2,62
And we are going to visit my
buddies, Sydney and Thurman


50
0:2:2,62 --> 0:2:8,774
Sewell, better known to America
as the ATL twins.


51
0:2:8,774 --> 0:2:10,2
SIDNEY SEWELL: You could
braid my hair.


52
0:2:10,2 --> 0:2:11,672
That would be pretty amazing.


53
0:2:11,672 --> 0:2:12,104
THURMAN SEWELL: Yeah.


54
0:2:12,104 --> 0:2:13,4
I'm not sure it's long enough.


55
0:2:13,4 --> 0:2:14,34
SIDNEY SEWELL: It's
long enough.


56
0:2:14,34 --> 0:2:16,29
Trust me.


57
0:2:16,29 --> 0:2:18,9
CHRIS NIERATKO: So when I first
met yous guys, you were


58
0:2:18,9 --> 0:2:20,7
big fish, small pond.


59
0:2:20,7 --> 0:2:22,17
Now yous guys have blown
up since then.


60
0:2:22,17 --> 0:2:24,29
What's changed since
I met you?


61
0:2:24,29 --> 0:2:24,84
THURMAN SEWELL: Shit, man.


62
0:2:24,84 --> 0:2:28,35
We've got some good
opportunities, man.


63
0:2:28,35 --> 0:2:30,55
A lot of people reached
out to us after that--


64
0:2:30,55 --> 0:2:31,415
like, big names.


65
0:2:31,415 --> 0:2:33,12
SIDNEY SEWELL: In that thing,
it said our dream was to


66
0:2:33,12 --> 0:2:35,66
become reality stars, which
I don't know if we


67
0:2:35,66 --> 0:2:36,82
ever even said that.


68
0:2:36,82 --> 0:2:38,52
Maybe we did, wasted.


69
0:2:38,52 --> 0:2:40,36
THURMAN SEWELL: And then
Harmony hit us up, and


70
0:2:40,36 --> 0:2:43,735
Harmony's like, don't fucking
do any reality shows.


71
0:2:43,735 --> 0:2:45,21
We went and met with Harmony.


72
0:2:45,21 --> 0:2:46,67
SIDNEY SEWELL: It was
just magical.


73
0:2:46,67 --> 0:2:47,92
We just clicked, man.


74
0:2:47,92 --> 0:2:49,27
I mean, seriously, we
was in Nashville.


75
0:2:49,27 --> 0:2:50,245
THURMAN SEWELL: And he was
talking about I'm doing this


76
0:2:50,245 --> 0:2:51,9
movie, "Spring Breakers."


77
0:2:51,9 --> 0:2:52,59
SIDNEY SEWELL: Told us all
about "Spring Breakers."


78
0:2:52,59 --> 0:2:53,69
THURMAN SEWELL: The script's
already done.


79
0:2:53,69 --> 0:2:55,13
But I'm gonna fucking find
a part for you guys.


80
0:2:55,13 --> 0:2:57,23
SIDNEY SEWELL: Filming "Spring
Breakers" was like one of the


81
0:2:57,23 --> 0:2:58,37
best times of our lives.


82
0:2:58,37 --> 0:2:59,53
And we look at things
differently


83
0:2:59,53 --> 0:3:0,45
now because of that.


84
0:3:0,45 --> 0:3:1,605
THURMAN SEWELL: To
be in a movie, a


85
0:3:1,605 --> 0:3:3,34
Harmony Korine movie--


86
0:3:3,34 --> 0:3:7,33
we're huge fans of Harmony
Korine, before we ever met the


87
0:3:7,33 --> 0:3:7,71
motherfucker.


88
0:3:7,71 --> 0:3:9,2
SIDNEY SEWELL: He's
not mainstream.


89
0:3:9,2 --> 0:3:11,45
But if you know what's up, you
would know who Harmony is.


90
0:3:11,45 --> 0:3:12,97
CHRIS NIERATKO: He wrote yous
guys in, didn't he?


91
0:3:12,97 --> 0:3:14,6
THURMAN SEWELL: There was a
part for a drug dealer on


92
0:3:14,6 --> 0:3:15,48
Franco's clique.


93
0:3:15,48 --> 0:3:18,122
He was like, I'm just
gonna make it two.


94
0:3:18,122 --> 0:3:21,28



95
0:3:21,28 --> 0:3:22,8
CHRIS NIERATKO: Why do
you think you guys


96
0:3:22,8 --> 0:3:24,2
get hated on so much?


97
0:3:24,2 --> 0:3:26,9
SIDNEY SEWELL: Why do we?


98
0:3:26,9 --> 0:3:27,99
THURMAN SEWELL: I think
people just hate, yo.


99
0:3:27,99 --> 0:3:29,73
SIDNEY SEWELL: People
think we're wiggers.


100
0:3:29,73 --> 0:3:31,74
CHRIS NIERATKO: You think that's
what it comes down to?


101
0:3:31,74 --> 0:3:33,3
THURMAN SEWELL: A
lot of haters.


102
0:3:33,3 --> 0:3:34,925
SIDNEY SEWELL: A lot of
people talking shit.


103
0:3:34,925 --> 0:3:41,34
Meth-head, fucking crack head,
inbred, white trash, twincest.


104
0:3:41,34 --> 0:3:43,12
We've heard it all.


105
0:3:43,12 --> 0:3:43,92
THURMAN SEWELL: I guess,
what was it?


106
0:3:43,92 --> 0:3:45,7
If you're not getting hated on,
then you're not doing it?


107
0:3:45,7 --> 0:3:47,58
I guess we're doing it.


108
0:3:47,58 --> 0:3:49,5
SIDNEY SEWELL: They have
this vision of us--


109
0:3:49,5 --> 0:3:50,46
THURMAN SEWELL: They
think we're real


110
0:3:50,46 --> 0:3:50,93
thugged out or something.


111
0:3:50,93 --> 0:3:51,39
SIDNEY SEWELL: And wiggery.


112
0:3:51,39 --> 0:3:52,5
You know what I mean?


113
0:3:52,5 --> 0:3:53,3
Who cares.


114
0:3:53,3 --> 0:3:53,87
We have fucking grills.


115
0:3:53,87 --> 0:3:54,73
So what?


116
0:3:54,73 --> 0:3:55,45
It's accessories.


117
0:3:55,45 --> 0:3:57,47
It's like wearing a
chain, you know?


118
0:3:57,47 --> 0:3:58,89
We like to get fresh.


119
0:3:58,89 --> 0:4:0,5
Sorry.


120
0:4:0,5 --> 0:4:2,195
I think a lot of people we meet
in person are, like, kind


121
0:4:2,195 --> 0:4:2,7
of shocked.


122
0:4:2,7 --> 0:4:4,49
Like, wow.


123
0:4:4,49 --> 0:4:6,29
Not to mention we're
cool as shit.


124
0:4:6,29 --> 0:4:9,3
Like, I don't care who you are
and what status you are--


125
0:4:9,3 --> 0:4:10,1
THURMAN SEWELL: I'm good friends
with Jamie Thomas.


126
0:4:10,1 --> 0:4:13,21
I'm good friends with Guy
Mariano, Brandon Biebel.


127
0:4:13,21 --> 0:4:17,1
I mean, if we're such wiggery
pieces of shit meth heads, I


128
0:4:17,1 --> 0:4:18,81
mean, why would somebody
like that fuck with us?


129
0:4:18,81 --> 0:4:20,26
There's a reason people
fuck with us.


130
0:4:20,26 --> 0:4:22,36
You know what I'm saying?


131
0:4:22,36 --> 0:4:23,593
LIL WYTE: Anytime I'm downtown,
man, I try to look


132
0:4:23,593 --> 0:4:23,94
up the twins.


133
0:4:23,94 --> 0:4:25,68
They're just humble
dudes, man.


134
0:4:25,68 --> 0:4:26,93
I'm one of them humble
guys, too.


135
0:4:26,93 --> 0:4:28,27
I don't like kicking it with
people who think they're too


136
0:4:28,27 --> 0:4:29,355
Hollywood to hang out.


137
0:4:29,355 --> 0:4:32,63
I don't like people that just
ain't real motherfuckers, man.


138
0:4:32,63 --> 0:4:35,4
And the twins are two of the
realest motherfuckers I've


139
0:4:35,4 --> 0:4:36,46
ever met in my fucking life.


140
0:4:36,46 --> 0:4:40,91
Their story is some fucking
VH1 shit, too.


141
0:4:40,91 --> 0:4:43,5
CHRIS NIERATKO: Do twin
friends act like this?


142
0:4:43,5 --> 0:4:43,41
DORIAN GRAY: No.


143
0:4:43,41 --> 0:4:44,68
Actually, they don't.


144
0:4:44,68 --> 0:4:47,47
Actually, the twin friends
I knew hated each other.


145
0:4:47,47 --> 0:4:52,61
But these two actually figured
out how to shine together and


146
0:4:52,61 --> 0:4:54,2
make it brilliant.


147
0:4:54,2 --> 0:4:56,63
SIDNEY SEWELL: We feel very
blessed to be a twin.


148
0:4:56,63 --> 0:4:59,6
Like, to be twins, you know
what I mean, and just have


149
0:4:59,6 --> 0:4:59,49
each other.


150
0:4:59,49 --> 0:5:1,56
Because at the end of the day,
everybody can go fuck


151
0:5:1,56 --> 0:5:1,87
themselves.


152
0:5:1,87 --> 0:5:2,77
We have each other.


153
0:5:2,77 --> 0:5:4,79
We understand that we're
born, we're different.


154
0:5:4,79 --> 0:5:5,28
You know what I mean?


155
0:5:5,28 --> 0:5:8,55
We understand that nobody ever
will understand what it's


156
0:5:8,55 --> 0:5:11,25
really like to be how we are,
just like we'll never


157
0:5:11,25 --> 0:5:13,38
understand what it's like
for you to be alone.


158
0:5:13,38 --> 0:5:14,42
CHRIS NIERATKO: What's
the longest you


159
0:5:14,42 --> 0:5:14,97
guys have been apart?


160
0:5:14,97 --> 0:5:16,1
SIDNEY SEWELL: Six hours.


161
0:5:16,1 --> 0:5:17,64
People ask the question, what
if one of you died?


162
0:5:17,64 --> 0:5:20,15
Well, I would die too,
because I would go


163
0:5:20,15 --> 0:5:20,84
jump off the balcony.


164
0:5:20,84 --> 0:5:22,68
You know?


165
0:5:22,68 --> 0:5:22,85
THURMAN SEWELL: Seriously.


166
0:5:22,85 --> 0:5:23,36
It would have to be like that.


167
0:5:23,36 --> 0:5:24,77
SIDNEY SEWELL: It's not
an option, man.


168
0:5:24,77 --> 0:5:27,43
There's no way we could live
without each other.


169
0:5:27,43 --> 0:5:30,85
Really, when it comes down to
it, we're the same person.


170
0:5:30,85 --> 0:5:31,89
We play roles.


171
0:5:31,89 --> 0:5:33,92
We play different roles.


172
0:5:33,92 --> 0:5:36,2
But we're a team.


173
0:5:36,2 --> 0:5:37,24
Like, he drives.


174
0:5:37,24 --> 0:5:38,29
THURMAN SEWELL: He
manages money.


175
0:5:38,29 --> 0:5:40,31
SIDNEY SEWELL: I deal
with bills and shit.


176
0:5:40,31 --> 0:5:40,92
Trust me.


177
0:5:40,92 --> 0:5:43,27
It's all fair, you know?


178
0:5:43,27 --> 0:5:43,875
THURMAN SEWELL: But
we couldn't live


179
0:5:43,875 --> 0:5:44,32
without each other.


180
0:5:44,32 --> 0:5:45,28
SIDNEY SEWELL: We're just
a packaged deal.


181
0:5:45,28 --> 0:5:45,97
That's how we're born.


182
0:5:45,97 --> 0:5:48,44
THURMAN SEWELL: It
is what it is.


183
0:5:48,44 --> 0:5:49,62
CHRIS NIERATKO: What I think
it comes down to is that


184
0:5:49,62 --> 0:5:51,68
people are jealous
that yous two are


185
0:5:51,68 --> 0:5:54,192
banging a bunch of chicks.


186
0:5:54,192 --> 0:5:55,665
-How much do you
love me, baby?


187
0:5:55,665 --> 0:6:0,84
THURMAN SEWELL: I love
you so much.


188
0:6:0,84 --> 0:6:2,48
CHRIS NIERATKO: What's
going on back there?


189
0:6:2,48 --> 0:6:3,77
MS. WYTE: Personally,
I couldn't see


190
0:6:3,77 --> 0:6:5,46
myself dating two brothers.


191
0:6:5,46 --> 0:6:9,5
But you know, I guess if I were
going to do that, I'd


192
0:6:9,5 --> 0:6:11,56
want them to be as cool as
the fucking ATL twins.


193
0:6:11,56 --> 0:6:12,29
SIDNEY SEWELL: I don't know.


194
0:6:12,29 --> 0:6:15,37
It was just natural that we
shared girls, you know?


195
0:6:15,37 --> 0:6:17,96
Honestly, we get two girls in
the mix, it fucks things up,


196
0:6:17,96 --> 0:6:18,9
to be honest with you.


197
0:6:18,9 --> 0:6:23,61
So we prefer girls
to be one girl.


198
0:6:23,61 --> 0:6:24,887
THURMAN SEWELL: I know what
you want to hear.


199
0:6:24,887 --> 0:6:26,137
-That's so wrong.


200
0:6:26,137 --> 0:6:30,86



201
0:6:30,86 --> 0:6:32,52
CHRIS NIERATKO: What's the
attraction for women?


202
0:6:32,52 --> 0:6:34,92
It takes a special kind of
woman to want to fuck two


203
0:6:34,92 --> 0:6:35,555
dudes at the same time.


204
0:6:35,555 --> 0:6:38,0
SIDNEY SEWELL: They all say
they would never do it.


205
0:6:38,0 --> 0:6:38,99
THURMAN SEWELL: I would
never do that.


206
0:6:38,99 --> 0:6:40,55
SIDNEY SEWELL: They
do it, trust me.


207
0:6:40,55 --> 0:6:42,1
THURMAN SEWELL: Because we do
have big-ass dicks, bro.


208
0:6:42,1 --> 0:6:45,46
SIDNEY SEWELL: We peak
at 9, 18 combined.


209
0:6:45,46 --> 0:6:48,49
Like the best thing, to me,
about fucking bitches is like


210
0:6:48,49 --> 0:6:50,48
the hunt of the whole thing.


211
0:6:50,48 --> 0:6:51,45
THURMAN SEWELL: It's like
an addiction, man.


212
0:6:51,45 --> 0:6:52,68
SIDNEY SEWELL: It's like
drugs, you know?


213
0:6:52,68 --> 0:6:54,153
-Yeah, I'm coming.


214
0:6:54,153 --> 0:6:56,608
I gotta go.


215
0:6:56,608 --> 0:6:59,31
THURMAN SEWELL: We
are good guys.


216
0:6:59,31 --> 0:7:1,63
We're just jaded on girls.


217
0:7:1,63 --> 0:7:3,51
SIDNEY SEWELL: You understand,
we've been so jaded on girls


218
0:7:3,51 --> 0:7:5,6
because every girl, every
serious relationship-- we've


219
0:7:5,6 --> 0:7:8,22
had quite a few relationships,
and been really in love, and


220
0:7:8,22 --> 0:7:9,21
they always break our hearts.


221
0:7:9,21 --> 0:7:11,33
We're to the point now,
we're like, fuck it.


222
0:7:11,33 --> 0:7:12,35
You know what I'm saying?


223
0:7:12,35 --> 0:7:14,96
THURMAN SEWELL: That's it.


224
0:7:14,96 --> 0:7:16,77
SIDNEY SEWELL: All right,
this is the girl.


225
0:7:16,77 --> 0:7:17,57
THURMAN SEWELL: Have
you met her before?


226
0:7:17,57 --> 0:7:18,95
Her stage name's Michelle.


227
0:7:18,95 --> 0:7:21,2
We met her at a strip clubs.


228
0:7:21,2 --> 0:7:22,215
CHRIS NIERATKO: Oh,
she's a stripper.


229
0:7:22,215 --> 0:7:23,825
THURMAN SEWELL: Yeah but she
only worked there for a week.


230
0:7:23,825 --> 0:7:27,45
And we met her at the last 15
minutes of a Saturday night


231
0:7:27,45 --> 0:7:31,9
shift and got her back to our
crib, blah blah blah, fell in


232
0:7:31,9 --> 0:7:32,99
love with her.


233
0:7:32,99 --> 0:7:36,54
She moved in with us the
next day, quit her job.


234
0:7:36,54 --> 0:7:39,27
We ended up getting really
serious with her, and getting


235
0:7:39,27 --> 0:7:40,62
her back with her parents.


236
0:7:40,62 --> 0:7:42,39
She'd run away from
her parents.


237
0:7:42,39 --> 0:7:43,92
Her parents are super
conservative,


238
0:7:43,92 --> 0:7:45,1
and blah blah blah.


239
0:7:45,1 --> 0:7:48,75
But like I said, they thought
that she was with him.


240
0:7:48,75 --> 0:7:51,82
They thought I was some weirdo
who couldn't get a girl, and


241
0:7:51,82 --> 0:7:51,3
they were like--


242
0:7:51,3 --> 0:7:52,305
SIDNEY SEWELL: So we
never split up.


243
0:7:52,305 --> 0:7:53,61
So he'd always be around.


244
0:7:53,61 --> 0:7:54,54
THURMAN SEWELL: I'd always be
around, but I'd be, like,


245
0:7:54,54 --> 0:7:55,25
standoffish.


246
0:7:55,25 --> 0:7:56,69
I wouldn't be all up on her.


247
0:7:56,69 --> 0:7:59,28
And we'd stay the
night and shit.


248
0:7:59,28 --> 0:8:0,13
It was crazy.


249
0:8:0,13 --> 0:8:2,25
They knew we were really about
her, their daughter.


250
0:8:2,25 --> 0:8:4,45
And we looked out for
her, you understand?


251
0:8:4,45 --> 0:8:7,32
SIDNEY SEWELL: After that, she
started bugging us to go back


252
0:8:7,32 --> 0:8:9,43
to school, and this and that.


253
0:8:9,43 --> 0:8:11,54
And all we wanted to do was
skate, and she didn't


254
0:8:11,54 --> 0:8:13,592
understand that.


255
0:8:13,592 --> 0:8:15,5
CHRIS NIERATKO: You guys were
engaged for five years.


256
0:8:15,5 --> 0:8:15,54
What happened?


257
0:8:15,54 --> 0:8:17,83
THURMAN SEWELL: Eventually one
day, she just fucking left.


258
0:8:17,83 --> 0:8:21,9
And we were heartbroken,
but whatever.


259
0:8:21,9 --> 0:8:26,62
The curse is, a beautiful girl
that's super into us, how she


260
0:8:26,62 --> 0:8:30,53
didn't go to her rich parents
and say, hey, I'm marrying


261
0:8:30,53 --> 0:8:31,2
these guys.


262
0:8:31,2 --> 0:8:32,399
Or I'm with these guys.


263
0:8:32,399 --> 0:8:32,98
No.


264
0:8:32,98 --> 0:8:34,2
SIDNEY SEWELL: We want kids,
you know what I mean?


265
0:8:34,2 --> 0:8:36,289
Of course.


266
0:8:36,289 --> 0:8:37,74
We hold our last name.


267
0:8:37,74 --> 0:8:41,1
It's up to us to keep
our legacy going.


268
0:8:41,1 --> 0:8:42,19
THURMAN SEWELL: But it's
gotta be the right


269
0:8:42,19 --> 0:8:42,84
chick, and you know--


270
0:8:42,84 --> 0:8:43,5
CHRIS NIERATKO: You
don't think that


271
0:8:43,5 --> 0:8:44,63
would fuck a kid up?


272
0:8:44,63 --> 0:8:46,132
SIDNEY SEWELL: If their dad
comes to pick them up, we're


273
0:8:46,132 --> 0:8:48,47
not going to both go show up
there and be like, hey, we're


274
0:8:48,47 --> 0:8:50,57
both the dads.


275
0:8:50,57 --> 0:8:53,51
I mean, there's certain things
you just don't tell people.


276
0:8:53,51 --> 0:8:55,5
And it's always been like that
when we're in relationships.


277
0:8:55,5 --> 0:8:56,38
Like, girls--


278
0:8:56,38 --> 0:8:58,24
THURMAN SEWELL: Society
doesn't work.


279
0:8:58,24 --> 0:9:1,36
I tell the girl, don't tell
them you're with twins.


280
0:9:1,36 --> 0:9:2,26
No.


281
0:9:2,26 --> 0:9:2,9
SIDNEY SEWELL: They're
going to look at you


282
0:9:2,9 --> 0:9:3,62
like you're a nut.


283
0:9:3,62 --> 0:9:4,91
You can say whatever
you want to.


284
0:9:4,91 --> 0:9:6,935
Fuck society.


285
0:9:6,935 --> 0:9:7,675
THURMAN SEWELL: Fuck society.


286
0:9:7,675 --> 0:9:8,6
Who gives a shit?


287
0:9:8,6 --> 0:9:9,96
SIDNEY SEWELL: Why play
by their rules?


288
0:9:9,96 --> 0:9:10,25
THURMAN SEWELL: Who cares?


289
0:9:10,25 --> 0:9:10,83
Why?


290
0:9:10,83 --> 0:9:11,77
SIDNEY SEWELL: We
don't have to.


291
0:9:11,77 --> 0:9:12,55
THURMAN SEWELL: Because of
what somebody thinks?


292
0:9:12,55 --> 0:9:13,8
Fuck them.


293
0:9:13,8 --> 0:9:24,27



294
0:9:24,27 --> 0:9:26,67
When we were kids, we would
fuck with hookers.


295
0:9:26,67 --> 0:9:27,33
It was so sketchy.


296
0:9:27,33 --> 0:9:30,385
You'd be outside, and these
fucking creepos would come up,


297
0:9:30,385 --> 0:9:31,65
you need a ride?


298
0:9:31,65 --> 0:9:32,72
CHRIS NIERATKO: Really?


299
0:9:32,72 --> 0:9:34,13
THURMAN SEWELL: People have
tried to kidnap us before.


300
0:9:34,13 --> 0:11:34,13
