0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:15,648



2
0:0:15,648 --> 0:0:18,74
IAN R CRANE: London getting the
Olympics wasn't exactly a


3
0:0:18,74 --> 0:0:20,13
great shock to me.


4
0:0:20,13 --> 0:0:25,17
Of course, London partied very
hard, and we were still


5
0:0:25,17 --> 0:0:29,21
partying the following morning
when, of course, we heard the


6
0:0:29,21 --> 0:0:30,75
London bombings.


7
0:0:30,75 --> 0:0:33,98
And this really set the scene
for everything that has


8
0:0:33,98 --> 0:0:37,15
unfolded and has continued
to unfold as we speak.


9
0:0:37,15 --> 0:0:41,52
I had felt for some time that
London was going to be the


10
0:0:41,52 --> 0:0:46,82
focus of a number of events
around about this particular


11
0:0:46,82 --> 0:0:48,8
period of time.


12
0:0:48,8 --> 0:0:51,48
Let's not ignore completely
the Mayan calendar.


13
0:0:51,48 --> 0:0:57,166
2012 was always going to
be a significant year.


14
0:0:57,166 --> 0:0:59,27
The symbolism associated
with the London


15
0:0:59,27 --> 0:1:1,11
Olympics is not random.


16
0:1:1,11 --> 0:1:4,15
The London Olympics logo is
certainly very interesting.


17
0:1:4,15 --> 0:1:7,13
I really didn't know what I
was necessarily looking to


18
0:1:7,13 --> 0:1:8,77
find, and then it jumped
out at me.


19
0:1:8,77 --> 0:1:12,8
I mean it literally was
a case of oh my God.


20
0:1:12,8 --> 0:1:16,705
That's when, for me, it became
the Zion Olympics.


21
0:1:16,705 --> 0:1:21,84
The London 2012 Olympics are
going to be the most heavily


22
0:1:21,84 --> 0:1:25,26
securitized event in history.


23
0:1:25,26 --> 0:1:30,1
Anti-aircraft missiles will be
located on an apartment block


24
0:1:30,1 --> 0:1:31,34
in East London.


25
0:1:31,34 --> 0:1:34,36
There's going to be a device
installed on a barge on the


26
0:1:34,36 --> 0:1:40,59
Thames which has the capacity
to disable crowds of people


27
0:1:40,59 --> 0:1:42,16
through sonic waves.


28
0:1:42,16 --> 0:1:45,92
And of course all this is on top
of a helicopter carrier in


29
0:1:45,92 --> 0:1:46,97
the Thames.


30
0:1:46,97 --> 0:1:52,63
49,000 military personnel will
be mingling with the athletes


31
0:1:52,63 --> 0:1:55,59
and with spectators at
the Olympic events.


32
0:1:55,59 --> 0:1:59,18
There's going to be an 11-mile
perimeter around the Olympic


33
0:1:59,18 --> 0:2:0,32
area in London.


34
0:2:0,32 --> 0:2:2,99
And literally the whole area
could be sealed off in a


35
0:2:2,99 --> 0:2:5,27
heartbeat, and then effectively
it becomes a


36
0:2:5,27 --> 0:2:7,3
concentration camp.


37
0:2:7,3 --> 0:2:9,32
What's going on right
now literally is a


38
0:2:9,32 --> 0:2:11,38
game of global monopoly.


39
0:2:11,38 --> 0:2:14,51
And the London Olympics
are a very, very


40
0:2:14,51 --> 0:2:16,5
important part of this.


41
0:2:16,5 --> 0:2:17,87
This is a document that
came into the


42
0:2:17,87 --> 0:2:20,43
public domain in 1967.


43
0:2:20,43 --> 0:2:22,56
One of the observations or
comments they make in this


44
0:2:22,56 --> 0:2:26,64
report is that if there was
the threat of an alien


45
0:2:26,64 --> 0:2:30,1
invasion, it would very quickly
draw all the nation


46
0:2:30,1 --> 0:2:34,2
states together under the guise
of a global government.


47
0:2:34,2 --> 0:2:37,2
On the basis that you can't rely
on the extraterrestrials


48
0:2:37,2 --> 0:2:41,8
to turn up on cue, you'd
have to stage it.


49
0:2:41,8 --> 0:2:44,5
It's my opinion that the London
Olympics are going to


50
0:2:44,5 --> 0:2:50,1
be used to stage an event of
such enormity it will give


51
0:2:50,1 --> 0:2:53,25
them the springboard to
introduce their one world


52
0:2:53,25 --> 0:2:54,16
government.


53
0:2:54,16 --> 0:2:57,8
This is a point of humanity's
evolution which


54
0:2:57,8 --> 0:3:0,155
is absolutely crucial.


55
0:3:0,155 --> 0:3:4,1



56
0:3:4,1 --> 0:3:6,3
MALE SPEAKER: We all know
why we're here.


57
0:3:6,3 --> 0:3:8,5
We don't want missiles
in residential areas.


58
0:3:8,5 --> 0:3:11,25
We do not want the
militarization of our


59
0:3:11,25 --> 0:3:12,626
communities.


60
0:3:12,626 --> 0:3:15,69
BRIAN WHELAN: We've seen the
biggest mobilization of troops


61
0:3:15,69 --> 0:3:18,2
in the UK since the end
of World War II.


62
0:3:18,2 --> 0:3:19,68
None of this is normal.


63
0:3:19,68 --> 0:3:22,7
And I think what is normal is
to come out like people did


64
0:3:22,7 --> 0:3:24,65
today and say no, you're
bloody not.


65
0:3:24,65 --> 0:3:25,9
My name is Brian Whelan.


66
0:3:25,9 --> 0:3:29,3
I'm a journalist currently
living in Bow Quarter, who


67
0:3:29,3 --> 0:3:33,75
initially made a lot of noise
about the sighting of missiles


68
0:3:33,75 --> 0:3:34,45
above my apartment.


69
0:3:34,45 --> 0:3:38,74
And for my sins, I'm now being
forced to leave my apartment.


70
0:3:38,74 --> 0:3:41,42
It's quite a complicated affair,
but let's just say


71
0:3:41,42 --> 0:3:44,335
that I'm leaving five days
before the opening ceremony of


72
0:3:44,335 --> 0:3:47,6
the Olympics, so the timing
is really suspicious.


73
0:3:47,6 --> 0:3:50,18
It also means now I can't be
party to a legal challenge


74
0:3:50,18 --> 0:3:51,19
against the MOD.


75
0:3:51,19 --> 0:3:53,23
So essentially the Olympics
has left me without


76
0:3:53,23 --> 0:3:53,78
somewhere to live.


77
0:3:53,78 --> 0:3:55,27
That's the position
I'm in now.


78
0:3:55,27 --> 0:3:59,2
I spoke out, and there's
consequences to when you speak


79
0:3:59,2 --> 0:4:1,14
out and try and ruin
the fun of a really


80
0:4:1,14 --> 0:4:2,39
big event like this.


81
0:4:2,39 --> 0:4:22,4



82
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:23,96
ANDREW PLENTY: For the
Olympics, we'll be


83
0:4:23,96 --> 0:4:26,46
anti-Maritime and air
threat security.


84
0:4:26,46 --> 0:4:31,0
So we'll be supporting the
police in their job in


85
0:4:31,0 --> 0:4:34,1
securing a safe and secure
Olympic games.


86
0:4:34,1 --> 0:4:38,36
So our main role will be the
stop of any threat that comes


87
0:4:38,36 --> 0:4:41,46
from the air or from the
maritime environment.


88
0:4:41,46 --> 0:4:45,13
There's no reason for anyone to
feel any increased feeling


89
0:4:45,13 --> 0:4:46,85
of threat just because
we're here.


90
0:4:46,85 --> 0:4:49,31
We're here to deter
any threats.


91
0:4:49,31 --> 0:4:52,59
Obviously the Olympic games
is a global event, and any


92
0:4:52,59 --> 0:4:55,8
country would put in place the
measures that would ensure a


93
0:4:55,8 --> 0:4:57,39
safe event occurs.


94
0:4:57,39 --> 0:5:0,28
So I don't think they've got any
reason to feel more scared


95
0:5:0,28 --> 0:5:3,84
at all, and I think
that's the key.


96
0:5:3,84 --> 0:5:18,5
[SHIP HORN]


97
0:5:18,5 --> 0:5:20,74
TOMMY SWIPE: I'm not afraid of
the Army or the police who's


98
0:5:20,74 --> 0:5:21,875
going to be at the Olympics.


99
0:5:21,875 --> 0:5:23,125
Don't bother me.


100
0:5:23,125 --> 0:5:29,38



101
0:5:29,38 --> 0:5:33,5
The Olympics, what is a
multimillion, billion pound


102
0:5:33,5 --> 0:5:35,37
event coming to London.


103
0:5:35,37 --> 0:5:37,845
South London, East London,
Hackney, is going to be a


104
0:5:37,845 --> 0:5:41,626
great money spinner for all of
us underworld criminals.


105
0:5:41,626 --> 0:5:43,48
TONY SALES: I think the Olympics
are probably the


106
0:5:43,48 --> 0:5:46,56
biggest opportunity for
fraudsters and all types of


107
0:5:46,56 --> 0:5:49,9
criminals that we've probably
seen in the recent years.


108
0:5:49,9 --> 0:5:53,47
In Hackney, it's one of the
biggest crime places in


109
0:5:53,47 --> 0:5:57,99
London, it's going to create an
absolute multitude of all


110
0:5:57,99 --> 0:5:58,96
different crimes.


111
0:5:58,96 --> 0:6:1,4
TOMMY SWIPE: My name
is Tommy Swipe, and


112
0:6:1,4 --> 0:6:3,11
I'm a full-time swiper.


113
0:6:3,11 --> 0:6:5,61
Been involved in criminal
activity all my life, since


114
0:6:5,61 --> 0:6:7,38
the age of 15.


115
0:6:7,38 --> 0:6:10,85
Allegations of selling cocaine,
firearms, Section 18


116
0:6:10,85 --> 0:6:14,92
with intent that could cause
grievous bodily harm, three


117
0:6:14,92 --> 0:6:16,94
assaults on police officers.


118
0:6:16,94 --> 0:6:19,302
There's loads-- it
goes on and on.


119
0:6:19,302 --> 0:6:22,12
TONY SALES: The most popular
crime at the Olympics could


120
0:6:22,12 --> 0:6:25,46
possibly be the RFID reader.


121
0:6:25,46 --> 0:6:29,32
You can just gain the
information just by simply


122
0:6:29,32 --> 0:6:32,23
running it over any
type of RFID card.


123
0:6:32,23 --> 0:6:35,27
So that might be an oyster card
or a PayPass card that we


124
0:6:35,27 --> 0:6:38,56
see with the little white wave
lines in the corner.


125
0:6:38,56 --> 0:6:41,35
You could then convert that
with the software that's


126
0:6:41,35 --> 0:6:44,83
available to get the 16-digit
number that's on the


127
0:6:44,83 --> 0:6:45,9
front of each card.


128
0:6:45,9 --> 0:6:47,63
TOMMY SWIPE: Through the
Olympics, I just find it an


129
0:6:47,63 --> 0:6:51,9
easy target to use the
scanner to go around.


130
0:6:51,9 --> 0:6:54,36
Easy to pickpocket
people's numbers.


131
0:6:54,36 --> 0:6:56,91
Sometimes I go out on me own
and do it, and I just walk


132
0:6:56,91 --> 0:6:59,23
close to people and just-- it's
not really that I really


133
0:6:59,23 --> 0:6:59,82
get a target really.


134
0:6:59,82 --> 0:7:2,18
I just walk past someone, as
soon as it picks up their


135
0:7:2,18 --> 0:7:3,21
numbers there it is.


136
0:7:3,21 --> 0:7:4,24
Bingo, isn't it?


137
0:7:4,24 --> 0:7:5,955
Liking walking into the shop,
buying a penny sweet.


138
0:7:5,955 --> 0:7:8,21
TONY SALES: This is how easy it
is to gain the information


139
0:7:8,21 --> 0:7:9,46
on the card.


140
0:7:9,46 --> 0:7:12,63



141
0:7:12,63 --> 0:7:16,868
That's it, we've got the
information as simple as that.


142
0:7:16,868 --> 0:7:20,125
TOMMY SWIPE: I'm a space-age
Fagan, you could say that.


143
0:7:20,125 --> 0:7:22,91



144
0:7:22,91 --> 0:7:26,91
At the Olympics I can make up to
thousands a day just for a


145
0:7:26,91 --> 0:7:28,365
few hour's work.


146
0:7:28,365 --> 0:7:31,185
A few hundred quid,
just one hour.


147
0:7:31,185 --> 0:7:35,38
The longer you're out,
the better it is.


148
0:7:35,38 --> 0:7:37,8
FREDDIE: Hi, I'm Freddie.


149
0:7:37,8 --> 0:7:40,34
We here in Scarborough shooting
Chariots of Jizz for


150
0:7:40,34 --> 0:7:42,349
the Television X Olympics
special.


151
0:7:42,349 --> 0:7:47,139



152
0:7:47,139 --> 0:7:49,57
I just like the whole
Olympic ethos.


153
0:7:49,57 --> 0:7:52,8
Even though it has become more
and more commercialized and


154
0:7:52,8 --> 0:7:55,28
more professional, I still think
it's the greatest show


155
0:7:55,28 --> 0:7:56,25
on Earth, really.


156
0:7:56,25 --> 0:7:59,89
Some people say they watch us
just to see the funny bits,


157
0:7:59,89 --> 0:8:1,48
rather than to watch
any of the sex.


158
0:8:1,48 --> 0:8:3,65
So we like that, that's good.


159
0:8:3,65 --> 0:8:11,858



160
0:8:11,858 --> 0:8:14,54
HONESTY: The scene we're
shooting today was in the


161
0:8:14,54 --> 0:8:15,45
equipment room.


162
0:8:15,45 --> 0:8:19,21
And the guys come in to put
their equipment away.


163
0:8:19,21 --> 0:8:22,14
And I'm in there as an athlete,
possibly typing my


164
0:8:22,14 --> 0:8:26,27
shoelaces, and we just sort
of go from there really.


165
0:8:26,27 --> 0:8:26,916
MALE SPEAKER: Action.


166
0:8:26,916 --> 0:8:28,205
HONESTY: Hello, boys.


167
0:8:28,205 --> 0:8:29,5
Have you been training?


168
0:8:29,5 --> 0:8:32,24
FREDDIE: Some of the athletes
that have performed at the


169
0:8:32,24 --> 0:8:35,289
Olympic games in previous years
had said that as soon as


170
0:8:35,289 --> 0:8:39,2
they finished their events,
all the athletes from that


171
0:8:39,2 --> 0:8:42,169
particular event would have a
big party and that often ended


172
0:8:42,169 --> 0:8:44,21
up in a bit of a sex orgy.


173
0:8:44,21 --> 0:8:45,88
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, that's good.


174
0:8:45,88 --> 0:8:47,215
Oh, you naughty girl.


175
0:8:47,215 --> 0:8:49,195
Look at that.


176
0:8:49,195 --> 0:8:50,68
MALE SPEAKER: Got about
half an hour.


177
0:8:50,68 --> 0:8:52,66
Another 10 minutes maybe,
and that's it.


178
0:8:52,66 --> 0:8:56,125



179
0:8:56,125 --> 0:9:0,145
FREDDIE: Team GB from Freddie,
bring back all the medals.


180
0:9:0,145 --> 0:9:10,655



181
0:9:10,655 --> 0:9:13,67
MALE SPEAKER: This whole
business has been positive on


182
0:9:13,67 --> 0:9:17,59
the idea of creating a heritage
or a legacy, and


183
0:9:17,59 --> 0:9:19,5
that's getting it the
wrong way round.


184
0:9:19,5 --> 0:9:21,5
Nobody can say what the
future will be.


185
0:9:21,5 --> 0:9:25,732
The thing you have to work
on is the present.


186
0:9:25,732 --> 0:9:28,77
MALE SPEAKER: You can't set
out to create legacy.


187
0:9:28,77 --> 0:9:29,77
Legacy is what happens.


188
0:9:29,77 --> 0:9:31,11
And you can't just say
look, I've just


189
0:9:31,11 --> 0:9:32,48
made some legacy here.


190
0:9:32,48 --> 0:9:35,14
Only history will tell, but my
suspicion is we're going to


191
0:9:35,14 --> 0:9:38,52
have a lot of rather large,
rather useless, rather empty


192
0:9:38,52 --> 0:9:41,28
buildings left in Stratford.


193
0:9:41,28 --> 0:9:43,8
FEMALE SPEAKER: Look where
Athens is now.


194
0:9:43,8 --> 0:9:47,76
I'm not saying that the games
bankrupted an entire country,


195
0:9:47,76 --> 0:9:49,255
but they certainly
didn't help.


196
0:9:49,255 --> 0:9:52,6
Britain's not exactly in such
a great position either.


197
0:9:52,6 --> 0:9:56,17
MALE SPEAKER: Are the Olympics
an opportunity or a threat?


198
0:9:56,17 --> 0:9:59,136
They're a great opportunity
for thieving.


199
0:9:59,136 --> 0:10:1,99
But the thieving seems to be
mostly carried out by those in


200
0:10:1,99 --> 0:10:3,82
charge of running
the Olympics.


201
0:10:3,82 --> 0:10:7,21
IAN R CRANE: I hope from the
bottom of my heart that the


202
0:10:7,21 --> 0:10:9,48
games goes off without
a hitch.


203
0:10:9,48 --> 0:10:12,79
If anything does occur, I would
say that don't take any


204
0:10:12,79 --> 0:10:14,515
the news reports
at face value.


205
0:10:14,515 --> 0:10:16,92
MALE SPEAKER: The government's
got good ideas, but the


206
0:10:16,92 --> 0:10:18,285
execution's not there.


207
0:10:18,285 --> 0:10:21,12
MALE SPEAKER: I think, generally
speaking, this is


208
0:10:21,12 --> 0:10:22,615
just going to be a
sporting event.


209
0:10:22,615 --> 0:10:24,97
Obviously, my biggest concern,
as somebody who lives and


210
0:10:24,97 --> 0:10:29,246
works in this borough, is about
people who live here.


211
0:10:29,246 --> 0:10:31,405
FEMALE SPEAKER: There was a lot
of propaganda about how it


212
0:10:31,405 --> 0:10:33,21
was going to bring regeneration,
how they're


213
0:10:33,21 --> 0:10:35,14
promising legacy benefits,
and so on.


214
0:10:35,14 --> 0:10:36,77
But that is not what's
happened at all.


215
0:10:36,77 --> 0:10:40,96
It seems to benefit only
corporations, and it's taken


216
0:10:40,96 --> 0:10:42,435
over our green spaces.


217
0:10:42,435 --> 0:10:45,56
FEMALE SPEAKER: My feelings are
they want Stratford city


218
0:10:45,56 --> 0:10:47,7
to be the up and coming
place to be.


219
0:10:47,7 --> 0:10:50,72
And they don't want the likes
of us, working-class people,


220
0:10:50,72 --> 0:10:51,37
in Stratford.


221
0:10:51,37 --> 0:10:53,77
No, they just want professional
people here--


222
0:10:53,77 --> 0:10:55,75
money people.


223
0:10:55,75 --> 0:10:58,57
FEMALE SPEAKER: Ultimately, it
does boil down to thousands


224
0:10:58,57 --> 0:11:1,7
upon thousands of little
individual lives that are now


225
0:11:1,7 --> 0:11:5,992
forever changed for three
weeks of a brand-fest.


226
0:11:5,992 --> 0:11:8,98
MALE SPEAKER: Same reason why
I didn't get tickets.


227
0:11:8,98 --> 0:11:10,61
But I can just watch
it on TV anyway.


228
0:11:10,61 --> 0:13:10,61
