-Yo, I'm in the jacuzzi,
hang on.


4
0:0:16,65 --> 0:0:18,564
Keep that lit for me, take
my fucking shades.


5
0:0:18,564 --> 0:0:19,814
Wear 'em if you want.


6
0:0:19,814 --> 0:0:22,6



7
0:0:22,6 --> 0:0:23,95
-So what'd the IRS say?


8
0:0:23,95 --> 0:0:25,27
-Three years in prison.


9
0:0:25,27 --> 0:0:27,32
-You haven't paid taxes
since '94, Donnie.


10
0:0:27,32 --> 0:0:28,17
-What are we talking about?


11
0:0:28,17 --> 0:0:29,28
50, 60 bucks?


12
0:0:29,28 --> 0:0:30,17
-$43,000.


13
0:0:30,17 --> 0:0:33,74
-Fuck no!


14
0:0:33,74 --> 0:0:35,66
-You've got to come up with
a way to get this money.


15
0:0:35,66 --> 0:0:37,605
-Holy cow, that's my boy.


16
0:0:37,605 --> 0:0:39,35
He moved out when
he turned 18.


17
0:0:39,35 --> 0:0:40,38
I haven't seen him since.


18
0:0:40,38 --> 0:0:41,86
-He's one of the youngest hedge
fund managers in the


19
0:0:41,86 --> 0:0:43,36
financial industry.


20
0:0:43,36 --> 0:0:46,39
-Maybe your son could
help you.


21
0:0:46,39 --> 0:0:48,33
-Todd, your old man is here?


22
0:0:48,33 --> 0:0:50,29
-Wazzup!


23
0:0:50,29 --> 0:0:51,29
-What are you doing here?


24
0:0:51,29 --> 0:0:52,86
-What type of guy would miss
his son's wedding?


25
0:0:52,86 --> 0:0:54,28
-You were basically the
worst parent ever.


26
0:0:54,28 --> 0:0:55,12
-I was awesome!


27
0:0:55,12 --> 0:0:56,15
-You know what I remember?


28
0:0:56,15 --> 0:0:58,6
Is me having to drive you home
from the beach that time


29
0:0:58,6 --> 0:0:59,81
because you were too drunk.


30
0:0:59,81 --> 0:1:2,22
-Somebody's hammered, they have
another guy drive home.


31
0:1:2,22 --> 0:1:3,2
-I was 8!


32
0:1:3,2 --> 0:1:5,349
-Yeah, you fucking drove
like a champ, too.


33
0:1:5,349 --> 0:1:7,12
Eh?


34
0:1:7,12 --> 0:1:8,145
Give me another chance.


35
0:1:8,145 --> 0:1:9,738
Get to know me a little bit.


36
0:1:9,738 --> 0:1:11,37
-You guys have fun at
the bachelor party.


37
0:1:11,37 --> 0:1:13,456
-Woo-woo, motherfucker.


38
0:1:13,456 --> 0:1:17,12
Last night of poon-tang
for this kid.


39
0:1:17,12 --> 0:1:18,89
What the fuck is this?


40
0:1:18,89 --> 0:1:21,53
-It's water infused with
cucumber, rose petal, and


41
0:1:21,53 --> 0:1:22,2
harvest sandlewood.


42
0:1:22,2 --> 0:1:25,1
-It tastes like fucking dick
infused with balls.


43
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:26,53
We can't let tonight
end like this.


44
0:1:26,53 --> 0:1:27,99
-I can stay out a
little later.


45
0:1:27,99 --> 0:1:28,465
-Bam!

49
0:1:40,269 --> 0:1:42,545
-I don't want to do that
in front of my kids.


50
0:1:42,545 --> 0:1:43,392
Turn around for a minute.


51
0:1:43,392 --> 0:1:44,748
Just turn around.


52
0:1:44,748 --> 0:1:46,56
Give me that fucking shit.


53
0:1:46,56 --> 0:1:48,55
-Don't forget you're going to
go to prison on Tuesday.


54
0:1:48,55 --> 0:1:50,3
You have got to get
that money.


55
0:1:50,3 --> 0:1:53,63
-Actually just trying to
be a dad right now.


56
0:1:53,63 --> 0:1:54,3
-Get the cake.


57
0:1:54,3 --> 0:1:57,9
No walnuts, no fucking
excuses, Todd.


58
0:1:57,9 --> 0:2:0,355
-Buddy, you gotta like,
stick up for yourself.


59
0:2:0,355 --> 0:2:1,652
That's my boy!


60
0:2:1,652 --> 0:2:6,6



61
0:2:6,6 --> 0:2:7,31
-Ever since you showed up,
Todd's been acting like a


62
0:2:7,31 --> 0:2:10,135
different person.


63
0:2:10,135 --> 0:2:12,76
-I promise you I'll never
forget you again.


64
0:2:12,76 --> 0:2:13,27
-You got me a gift?


65
0:2:13,27 --> 0:2:14,48
An earring.


66
0:2:14,48 --> 0:2:16,786
But I don't have
a pierced ear.


67
0:2:16,786 --> 0:2:17,234
-Yeah.

69
0:2:19,2 --> 0:2:20,87
Oh got it.


70
0:2:20,87 --> 0:2:22,45
-Am I bleeding?


71
0:2:22,45 --> 0:2:25,27
-I don't think so.

0:2:25,736 --> 0:2:27,14
Oh god, ahhh.


74
0:2:27,14 --> 0:2:29,908
I just found my wedding dress
covered in barf-- and


75
0:2:29,908 --> 0:2:31,158
something else.


76
0:2:31,158 --> 0:2:33,9



77
0:2:33,9 --> 0:2:36,83
You puked on my dress
and then fucked it.
