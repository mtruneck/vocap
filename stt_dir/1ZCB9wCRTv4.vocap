###6 MALE SPEAKER 1: Hey.
###8 What time is it?
###11 Right now, what time is it?
###14 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: 7:15.
###15 MALE SPEAKER 1: 7:15 what?
###17 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: In the morning.
###20 Gotta get a little footage, but can't even have a board.
###24 Joke!
###25 Look what you're making me skate.
###27 You forget to send me boards.
###29 Look at this soggy, chipped piece of wood that you expect
###34 me to get footage on.
###36 Are you serious?
###38 
###46 I was going to Philly a lot, and then I just finished high
###49 school, and Bill had a house out there with his girlfriend
###54 at the time.
###55 I just was staying with him a lot of weekends and stuff and
###59 ended up just getting my own place out there.
###62 Still at that time, 17 years old, skating was so consuming,
###68 and Philadelphia was complete skate, too.
###71 And we would just skate all day and night, have some
###75 beers, go to bed, skate, and that's all there was.
###78 
###103 BRIAN WENNING: Where is it at?
###104 
###109 [LAUGHTER]
###111 ROB PLUHOWSKI: Philadelphia was a great fit for anybody.
###113 You know, there was love at the prime time.
###117 It was, like, everyone would skate in the park all day.
###120 It was just love all day--
###121 City Hall, love City Hall.
###123 I mean, those guys definitely put it more on the map, you
###126 know, with the Habitat video, and the Workshop video.
###130 It came down to, just, turning things around for everyone,
###133 you know, skateboard-wise.
###135 And they really opened people's eyes to who they were
###138 really fast.
###139 You know, when those guys first came down, it was nose
###141 grind pop out era.
###142 You know, everything was nosegrind
###143 pop out at the ledge.
###145 And they just do it all.
###146 They could just-- and, fuck, none of us could even
###147 nosegrind the Love ledges, you know, besides Kalis.
###151 And those guys just come down there and just blew everyone's
###154 minds away.
###155 I mean, Wenning was doing shit on ledges that he couldn't
###158 even, like, fathom.
###158 You know, it was amazing.
###160 I would say Wenning, more first.
###162 But Anthony was kind of--
###164 Anthony came up real fast, you know what I mean.
###166 
###177 They weren't much alike, that's for sure.
###179 I mean, Wenning was, like--
###180 Wenning always wanted the attention, You know, he was,
###183 like, doing stupid shit to get people to look at him.
###187 And then, you know, Anthony would just be skating.
###191 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: You know, I look at my skating when I
###192 was 15 or 16, now.
###193 I don't regret a lot of the stuff I did, but it's just,
###198 definitely, you change.
###199 I hope you would change.
###201 I hope everyone would change from when they're 15, 16 years
###204 old, otherwise, it would be a fucked up place, man.
###208 But I don't have the fucking mentals to do a lot of the
###212 skating I used to do back then.
###215 
###218 MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh, oh.
###219 
###222 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Did I almost do it?
###224 MALE SPEAKER 1: You all right?
###225 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah, let me see it.
###227 ROB PLUHOWSKI: I would say the one that stands out in my
###229 mind, right now--
###232 that was the switch ollie into the fountain, for sure.
###235 They had never even ollied it.
###236 You know what I mean, they didn't even try to ollie it,
###238 ever, just straight to switch ollie.
###240 That blows my mind away.
###242 MALE SPEAKER 1: Ugh.
###244 ROB PLUHOWSKI: He, just, did it.
###245 I mean, he got broke.
###246 He got beat up.
###247 I mean, I was scared for him, sometimes.
###249 Yeah, like, switch ollie into the fountain at night, what
###251 the hell are you thinking?
###254 AUDIENCE: Woo!
###254 [CHEERS]
###260 AUDIENCE: Whoa!
###263 BRIAN WENNING: I don't know.
###263 Hanging with PJ Ladd in California, sometimes, it
###266 gives me the feeling that hanging with
###268 Anthony back then.
###269 
###272 AUDIENCE: [CHEERS]
###277 BRIAN WENNING: That's why we were in competition.
###279 It would help both of us.
###281 AUDIENCE: Oh!
###283 BRIAN WENNING: I don't know if he just forgot
###284 about himself or what.
###286 I mean, I still skate the same exact shit.
###288 But maybe he thought it was time to move on.
###294 AUDIENCE: Yeah.
###295 BRIAN WENNING: That was the time when, like, he'd be at
###297 the spot at Love Park, and we wouldn't even talk.
###302 
###307 [CHEERING]
###308 MALE SPEAKER 2: But you switch 180'd it.
###310 BRIAN WENNING: Oh, yeah.
###311 MALE SPEAKER 2: Did you have it in mind that, OK, he
###312 switch ollied it?
###313 BRIAN WENNING: I don't know.
###313 Somebody was telling me, in the background, like, when I--
###315 because he did it, like, a week before.
###316 Then I, like how, that Vern Larid character likes to say
###321 it on video--
###322 "oh, that was before Brian did
###323 switchbacks." I went hey, whatever.
###325 So I landed that.
###326 I got a cheesesteak, and like, everybody went crazy.
###328 And then you look over, and Anthony's, like, trying to do
###330 a nollie tre-flip no spin or nollie flipout no spin or
###332 nollie flipout, or something to make [INAUDIBLE]
###333 But yeah, I don't-- we just separated.
###336 That was it.
###336 That was, like, the breaking--
###337 That was, just ridiculous.
###341 He claims-- there was something in some magazine--
###342 I remember, that we only had skateboarding in common, but.
###346 It's probably true, but whatever.
###349 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah, I don't know, man.
###350 I think we just, kind of, grew apart.
###352 Like, you know, when you're young, something like
###354 skateboarding could just--
###356 you know, you just have that little thing that two people
###358 do, and that you guys could just grow and be, like, the
###361 sickest friends, ever.
###363 And it's just skateboarding, you know.
###364 But as you get older, it's, like, you kind of get involved
###366 in other stuff--
###367 good, bad--
###369 it doesn't even have to be, like, other, you know.
###371 And I think that's just, kind of, what happened with us.
###374 You know, I think at a point, all's we did have was skating.
###377 
###380 BRIAN WENNING: I don't know.
###381 I don't know.
###383 I could talk to him, now, like, man to man, easy.
###389 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Is that swollen?
###391 MALE SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE].
###393 
###398 BILL STROBECK: Everyone regrets shit they do when
###399 they're 16, you know.
###400 He had, like, huge gear.
###402 He was, like--
###403 he looks totally different, you know what I mean.
###405 He grew out of that.
###406 He was, like hip hop-- like, he looked funny.
###411 I mean, we all looked funny back then.
###412 We were young, you know.
###413 He skated very conventionally, then, you know what I mean I
###417 think he was, like, doing what he thought other people
###420 wanted him to do.
###422 I think that now he kind of does what he wants, and that's
###426 what makes him happy.
###427 And I think that's fine.
###429 
###432 MALE SPEAKER 2: By the time he got to Mosaic, do you think he
###434 was a different person than he was from Photosynthesis?
###437 BILL STROBECK: I feel like around the end
###438 of Mosaic, he was.
###440 But people change every, like, 10 minutes.
###442 Like 10 minutes ago, I was in my sweatpants in that bed,
###445 right there, you know what I mean.
###446 He was, definitely, changing.
###447 I mean, those years from like 16 to 24, people change, like,
###452 significantly.
###454 You're a kid.
###455 You don't know what you're doing.
###455 You're trying things to see what you like,
###457 you know what I mean.
###458 And then, eventually, down the line, you know what you like.
###460 
###466 AUDIENCE: Whoa!
###468 
###470 BILL STROBECK: All his friends that skated
###471 don't skate no more.
###472 He skated with Rob Pluhowski, who has two kids and works in
###477 fucking sanding wood all day.
###481 What's up, Rob?
###483 I love Rob.
###484 Rob is one of my best friends, man.
###486 I haven't seen him in a long time but--
###488 we were real--
###489 us three were real close.
###490 Like, we were, like-- hang everyday.
###492 
###497 MALE SPEAKER 1: Come on, Papp.
###499 Get off of this.
###500 
###504 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: You know, they were
###505 just my friends growing--
###506 like, since 15 on.
###509 You know, in skating or outside of skating, we could,
###511 like, we could have a cup of coffee and have a chat or
###514 something, talk about normal shit.
###519 Rob always had a good attitude of kind of
###521 knowing this isn't--
###523 and kind of trained me, where--
###525 I think it's a good mentality, where people take this skating
###527 thing too serious.
###529 And it's, like, you're not a fucking rock star, and like,
###533 just, skaters have a problem being, like, a realist, and
###537 just, you know, it's going to end.
###539 And Rob always had a good level head of, like, well this
###541 isn't going to last forever.
###542 So while we have off time, and we're getting paid to do
###546 nothing, you know, let's go to Cook-- like, let's go do
###548 something, and go on a road trip or something.
###550 And it was always fun.
###551 It was cool.
###552 ROB PLUHOWSKI: Philly was dead.
###553 It was just--
###555 It wasn't--
###556 there was-- it was just dead.
###558 I felt like I needed a change in my life.
###561 So I always wanted to live in New York.
###563 And Anthony was--
###565 he's always--
###566 You know, he's from Long Island.
###567 He came up there with me.
###569 We got an apartment together.
###570 We lived together.
###571 It was great That was a good year of my life,
###574 living on 1st and 10th.
###576 And then things started to change, and,
###578 like, I had a kid.
###580 And I had to do what I had to do here.
###582 And then I got kicked off of Habitat.
###585 You know, then I started to realize that skateboarding
###587 wasn't for me, you know, in the long run.
###590 I would skate with them everyday, kind of.
###592 You know, I think when I left, it was, kind of, like a last
###595 friend on the team, you know.
###597 It's like, Anthony is a really down to earth guy, you know
###599 what I mean.
###599 He's like, there's no ego involved.
###602 There's no, like--
###603 He just wants to go skateboard and have a good time, you know
###606 what I mean.
###607 He, just, enjoys his time, there.
###608 And you get in a van and you go on a trip, and within five
###613 minutes, like, dudes, they won't stop talking about
###616 themselves.
###618 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Hey man, it's a great company.
###620 It's, like, at one time, I think, when I first got on
###623 Alien, it was heavily East Coast and had all those
###628 influences and those people behind it and style and ideas
###632 and aesthetics.
###633 And I think that did die out, you know, and
###636 I don't think it's--
###637 And I don't know who to say if that's a good
###639 thing or a bad thing.
###640 It just, that's what makes it just skating.
###643 And It's just--
###644 I'm sure there's tons of kids, you know, in California, that
###647 love Alien now, that didn't like it, you
###650 know, when it was more.
###651 So it's just, like, who's to say that it was better then,
###654 but I think it was more of an East Coast vibe, at a point,
###660 like one of those older types of teams-- like
###662 Rick and those dudes.
###664 You know, you'll catch them all skating together in
###666 California.
###669 BILL STROBECK: I feel like--
###669 I mean, dude, he was Workshop forever.
###671 I mean, he had the tattoo.
###673 He had a Workshop tattoo, you know.
###675 I don't even know if he still has it.
###676 I think he does.
###678 It's right on his wrist, but--
###679 And then, you know, Alien changed, but like, it was like
###682 that, dude.
###683 It was, like, then all these new dudes got on.
###685 Anthony got in Chocolate right after that.
###688 It was like, seriously, like, I feel like a couple months
###690 after that, he was just, like, you know, I'm on Chocolate.
###692 ROB PLUHOWSKI: I don't know.
###693 You know, Anthony just wanted to be with dudes
###696 that kind of, like--
###697 you know, like Mike Carroll, Rick Howard.
###699 You know, they went out and skated and had a good time,
###701 came home--
###701 like, did their own thing, had, like, a little family
###704 feeling thing going on.
###705 But at Workshop at that time, it was kind of like, everyone
###709 was out to be number one.
###711 He was, like, you know, I just need something changed,
###713 something more me.
###714 You know what I mean?
###715 Something more--
###718 more, his style.
###720 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: So this is it.
###721 You guys made it over here.
###723 No one's really seen it to this level in a while.
###726 Everyone, kind of, when I first got it, people came over
###728 here and were, like, what are you going to do in this
###731 dungeon, just be by yourself like you always do?
###734 And it's just like-- no, no, like, I'm going to fix it up
###737 and do what I want to do and, like, make stuff.
###741 [SAW RUNNING]
###750 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: This stuff's beautiful.
###751 It looks like a painting, almost, you know.
###754 But it's just like skating-- you know, you just get older.
###756 And it's like skating can--
###758 you want it to, but physically, your body doesn't
###760 let you do what you want to be doing.
###763 And it could frustrate you, and you could put that energy
###766 into something totally negative, which is sad.
###770 I think a lot of people in the skateboard world do.
###776 Or you could try to do something.
###777 I don't know what's cooler.
###778 I don't know, you could try to make something,
###780 and do other stuff.
###784 That's pretty much what this is.
###785 
###792 Yeah, I mean, woodworking and just trying to make stuff--
###796 you know, if this is what I'm going to be doing for the next
###799 50 years, I don't know.
###800 You know, it's keeping me busy, now.
###802 I really enjoy doing it.
###804 And like I said, it's, like, East Coast Pro, it's like, I
###808 mean, you see it.
###809 It's a lot of downtime, not skating.
###812 You know, you piss away a lot of free time.
###815 And I think I just hit a point where that free time was
###818 killing me.
###819 I couldn't do it anymore.
###821 I needed a place or something to make myself feel like I'm
###826 doing something productive when I'm not skating, instead
###830 of, you know, sitting at the bar or something
###834 or watching TV or--
###837 which I, you know, no hard feelings.
###841 You know, to each their own, but I just know, as a personal
###843 thing, where I was at a year or two ago, I just needed
###848 something more than just numbing myself out when I was
###851 done skating.
###853 You just have to keep it going.
###856 TED BARROW: I guess I met Pappalardo in late 2003, when
###859 he moved to New York.
###861 I don't know, you know, like, on one hand, like, you sort of
###864 have a preconceived idea.
###864 You know, like, you think about dudes that skate for
###867 Alien, and you think of, like, Van Englen and fucking Kalis
###871 and people like that.
###872 And they're, like, sort of intimidating.
###873 So you've got to think like a kid from the East Coast that
###876 came up skating in Philly, essentially.
###878 Like you know when you see his first couple parts, like, he
###881 might be kind of a dick.
###882 He definitely was a lot more down to earth, it comes to
###885 meeting him, you know.
###887 I mean, every interview where people are talking about the
###889 Lakai video, they're like, oh, there's such this, like, big,
###892 long expectation.
###893 Everyone's hopes are so high, like, blah blah blah.
###895 Like, I'm sure he doesn't respond to that at all.
###898 Like that's the last thing he wants to think about.
###902 And so like, probably woodworking or whatever he's
###905 doing off the board is probably, like, in some ways
###907 therapeutic, or it's just, kind of, keeping him
###908 grounded, you know.
###911 BILL STROBECK: Anthony's just like, not--
###913 I feel like he's just not gung ho about it.
###915 Like I don't feel like he, like, wakes up and, like,
###917 "fuck, dude, I got to, like, go out and backslide 360 flip
###923 tailslide on this ledge, right now." Like I think he does
###928 what he thinks looks good, and it's not
###932 about impressing anyone.
###935 It's not about impressing anyone at all.
###937 It's kind of just being true to yourself.
###940 
###945 AUDIENCE: Woo!
###946 ROB PLUHOWSKI: Yeah, he doesn't--
###947 he's definitely not a spotlight person, you know.
###949 He doesn't really--
###952 yeah, it, definitely, frustrates him, for sure.
###954 You know, he doesn't like people caring or even wanting
###957 to care about what he's up to.
###958 
###964 He's just to himself, you know.
###965 He's just a normal person, who just--
###967 he's good at skateboarding.
###968 And people might say, hey, you know, what's Anthony doing,
###970 what's he up to?
###971 Like, he's out skateboarding in Brooklyn somewhere.
###973 You know what I mean?
###974 Maybe he's by himself.
###975 Maybe he's with Bill, you know, I don't know.
###978 
###986 MALE SPEAKER 1: Is that asphalt all right?
###988 
###996 TED BARROW: I had to go to Williamsburg early in the
###998 morning on a fucking Sunday, 8:00 in the morning.
###1000 I rode my bike over the bridge, and I get a text from
###1006 Pappalardo, like 15 minutes later.
###1007 And he's, like, riding your bike over the
###1009 Williamsburg Bridge?
###1011 And I was, like, what are you doing up?
###1012 And he's like, "killing it." Like, where the fuck was he?
###1015 Like, I don't-- you know, what was he doing at 8:00 the
###1018 morning on a Sunday?
###1019 
###1029 TY EVANS: Like, the root of skateboarding has, and always
###1032 will be, fun.
###1034 And making skate videos, you definitely have to put in
###1037 work, and it takes the fun aspect out of it.
###1040 You know, we've got to go [INAUDIBLE] this, we've got to
###1042 go write this up.
###1042 We've got to go here.
###1043 We've got to do that.
###1044 And skating's not like that.
###1047 You know, skating's like, what Pappalardo's part's about.
###1052 It is about going out your door and
###1054 skating down the street.
###1056 I don't think you'd ever see Papps skating like one of
###1059 those makeshift jump ramp ledges, or something.
###1061 You know what I mean.
###1062 It's like, he skates, like, true stuff that you would find
###1065 just lurking around.
###1066 
###1079 Out of all the parts in the video, look at Papps' part,
###1082 and it's the most true to skating.
###1085 It's the less contrived part out of everything, you know.
###1089 And that's what makes Papps' part stand out, you know,
###1092 aside from the fact that it's all on the East Coast.
###1095 You know, that's the totally raw, pure form of skating.
###1099 That's, basically, the equivalent of jumping out of
###1101 your front door and skating something.
###1103 
###1116 MALE SPEAKER 2: Do you think, like, the vibe of Fully
###1119 Flaired or the vibe of, like, the rest of the team had
###1121 anything to do with him not skating for Lakai anymore
###1124 after that?
###1126 TY EVANS: No.
###1128 I mean, I don't know if it's common knowledge, but that was
###1131 going on before the video was even over.
###1133 You know, it's like--
###1136 I think the one thing about Lakai is that there's so many
###1141 good guys on there, they all deserve to have shoes and
###1144 these great deals.
###1145 And I don't care what company you are, it's like, how do you
###1150 support 19 pro shoes?
###1153 That's a huge salary.
###1155 You've got to be, like, the swoosh or the three stripes to
###1159 support some shit like that.
###1161 You know, and I'm sure when Papps was filming his part, he
###1166 knew, like, I'm just going to get through this Lakai fucking
###1168 thing, get through this beast, and then I'll get on a shoe
###1170 company and pay some bills.
###1171 Like you know, I think it's great that someone like Alex
###1175 and Papps can go and live a little bit more
###1177 comfortably, you know.
###1179 You know It's not affecting their positions on
###1182 Chocolate or Girl.
###1183 I think, like, what Federico was saying, like, you know,
###1185 it's pretty cool that, like, everything just kind of worked
###1187 out, you know.
###1187 BILL STROBECK: Like, he's doing all right.
###1189 He's doing good.
###1191 He's stoked.
###1192 And out of everything, I think leaving Lakai was a
###1194 good thing for him.
###1196 I think it was like, you know, Rick and Mike left their,
###1200 like, companies, you know, when they're younger, like, to
###1202 try their own things and to see if they like it.
###1204 I mean-- and they seem to be doing well themselves, so.
###1208 Hmm.
###1210 He seems to be like the forefront--
###1212 like, he seems to be, like, the dude at Converse, you know
###1215 what I mean.
###1216 So that's, like, a good thing, you know, because he's like,
###1218 oh, I want this shoe, like, I can get it.
###1220 You know what I mean?
###1221 Like, I can tell them I want this in suede--
###1222 I want this, like, and it's there.
###1224 You know, they're super down for him.
###1227 MALE SPEAKER 2: Is Converse--
###1228 they get behind this kind of stuff?
###1230 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah, they were psyched.
###1232 They were, like, the initial people that helped me out with
###1235 the space and getting the space going, and then pushing
###1240 me to do some more of this stuff.
###1245 And that's a good feeling to have, you know.
###1249 Not just like, "send me your footage tape for 30 seconds of
###1253 footage."
###1253 And you know, they know I'm skating when I'm skating.
###1257 And in here, I'm not trying to fool anyone, or--
###1260 it's a really good relationship.
###1262 And I think some of the first 20, 25 people, like shops and
###1268 stuff that kind of order Converse, and just shops in
###1271 general that carry the product and back it will get, like,
###1275 one of these benches or something.
###1276 We're trying to work something out.
