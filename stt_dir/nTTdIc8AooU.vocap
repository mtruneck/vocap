###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: One of the world`s most powerful countries is selecting a new
###4 leader. We are not talking about the U.S. election, but we have a lot of follow-up on
###7 that at well. Welcome to CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###23 We are starting with the U.S. presidential election. The election night audience wasn`t
###28 limited to the United States. From South America to Europe, Africa to the Middle East and Asia,
###33 the world was watching as results came in on Tuesday night.
###36 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###36 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s a day to celebrate for Barack Obama supporters. Let`s get to
###40 the big headlines at this moment. Barack Obama is reelected U.S. president. The first picture
###47 of the first couple`s victory as Obama tweets a thank you to his voters for a second term.
###61 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###67 AZUZ: So people were watching the election in the real world, and many of them were talking
###73 about the election in the digital one. Karin Caifa look at the role that social media took
###78 on during election day and some of the trends that defined the day.
###81 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###82 KARIN CAIFA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As election day turned into election night, millions of
###86 votes and how they added up generated million of tweets, leading up to this one: a thank
###92 you from a newly reelected president of the United States.
###95 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: For the United States of America,
###98 the best is yet to come.
###100 (APPLAUSE)
###101 CAIFA: Election day 2012 took its place as Twitter`s biggest political event ever. And
###107 as TV networks called the race, second screens lit up at a rate of more than 327,000 tweets
###113 per minute. Google searches pointed to an anxious electorate. Top search terms during
###118 the day included "election results", "exit polls", "election news" and "Who`s winning
###123 the election?" On Facebook, the number one term Tuesday morning and afternoon, variations
###129 of "vote", "voted", and "go vote." After projections, "Obama wins" jumped to the top spots on both
###135 Facebook and Google.
###137 Meanwhile, among Instagram photos, a bevy of proud ballot shots raised legal questions
###142 in states with restrictions on photography in polling places. In November 2008, about
###148 37 percent of Americans said they used a social networking site. Fast forward to 2012, two
###153 thirds are socially engaged.
###155 MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You guys are the best.
###157 CAIFA: And while Republicans made social strides, they are still catching up to do -- Mitt Romney
###162 amassed a respectable 1.7 million Twitter follows during his campaign; still, just a
###168 fraction of President Obama`s over 22 million.
###172 In Chicago, I`m Karin Caifa.
###174 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###175 AZUZ: Well, President Obama has been elected to a second term in the White House, but the
###179 next four years could present some big challenges for the president and the country. The fiscal
###184 cliff has to do with the U.S. debt, some spending cuts and tax increases are said to kick in
###190 unless President Obama and Congress can come up with other ways to get the country`s debt
###195 under control. Most American voters said the economy was the number one issue in this election.
###201 One thing the financial experts look at in order to figure out how the economy is doing
###205 is the U.S. stock markets, specifically, the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Yesterday, it
###210 dropped more than 300 points, the worst one day drop in a year. So, things are still pretty
###216 rough on Wall Street, and that`s why economic issues like the fiscal cliff are going to
###220 get a lot of attention.
###222 What else lies ahead for the president`s second term? There is a possibility he could nominate
###226 more justices to the U.S. Supreme Court. He nominated two during his first term, plus
###231 some members of the president`s cabinet have said they`ll step down, so he`ll need to fill
###235 those positions as well.
###237 Before we leave election night behind, we want to point out some firsts that happened
###241 on Tuesday. Same-sex marriage became legal in Maryland and Maine. A similar vote in Washington
###247 was still pending. Judges and legislators have approved it in other states, but this
###252 was the first time that voters approved same-sex marriage.
###256 In Wisconsin, Tammy Baldwin became the first openly gay politician elected to the U.S.
###260 Senate. She`s also the first woman elected to the Senate from Wisconsin.
###265 Voters in two states, Colorado and Washington, approved legalizing marijuana. That`s a first,
###270 but it`s also not a done deal. The federal government says marijuana is illegal, and
###275 that overrules states rights in this case. And for the first time, a majority of voters
###280 in Puerto Rico said they would like the U.S. territory to change its status and become
###285 a U.S. state.
###287 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###288 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just the facts: in 1949, China officially changed its name to the People`s
###295 Republic of China. The country had existed for centuries, but 1949 was when China became
###301 a communist nation. In a communist country, the government controls the economy and one
###307 political party holds all the power.
###309 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###312 AZUZ: That government and country are set to get a new leader. Now, there won`t be a
###317 new party in charge of China. The Communist Party will still lead the country`s government,
###322 but there will be a different person heading up that party. Every five years, more than
###327 2,200 delegates from the Communist Party Congress get together. They evaluate the country`s
###332 progress and set new directions for China. Every ten years, they pick new leadership.
###337 That process started today. Most, maybe all of the decisions are determined in advance.
###342 And that`s why we can tell you that this man, Xi Jingping, is expected to be China`s next
###347 president. He`s been the vice president for nearly 5 years, but some experts describe
###351 Xi as a mystery. They say they are not sure what type of leader he would be.
###356 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###357 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What`s the word? It`s a type of winter storm that commonly hits
###363 this part of the United States.
###367 Nor`easter. That`s the word.
###372 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###374 AZUZ: There is one of those bearing down on the Northeastern U.S. right now. Yes, this
###379 is the same part of the country that was hit less than two weeks ago by Sandy. A lot of
###384 people still recovering from that storm. Hundreds of thousands still don`t have power. And now
###389 they are going to have to deal with this two. You are looking at more rain, more wind, now
###393 add snow to the mix. The Nor`easter could drive temperatures down into the `20s, and
###398 that could be a serious problem for the thousands of people whose homes don`t have heat or power.
###403 Rob Marciano has more on these winter storms.
###405 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###406 ROB MARCIANO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A Nor`easter is the storm that typically happens in the
###409 Northeast. That`s not why it`s called a Nor`easter, though. The name comes from the wind or the
###414 prevailing wind that you typically get from that sort of storm, which is out of the Northeast,
###418 and the bigger, stronger the storm, the stronger the Nor`east wind is.
###425 Nor`easters are typically a weak storm that make their way across the U.S. and will get
###432 a little bit of energy from the jet stream, and then when they heat the coast, that difference
###436 in temperature between the land and the ocean, that gives them a little bit more in the way
###440 of instability and more fuel for the fire.
###446 Common characteristics of a Nor`easter are wind, rain, sometimes snow, definitely waves
###452 battering the coastline, and because of that you can get some beach erosion, you can get
###455 some coastal flooding. A storm surge is possible as well. So, a lot of damage can be done not
###461 only along the shoreline, but also inland in form of winds and heavy snow. Sometimes
###466 Nor`easters can dump several feet of snow, especially at the higher terrain.
###472 Nor`easters typically happen anywhere really from September all the way to May. The more
###478 intense ones happen really in the fall and winter time, but spring time, you can get
###482 some Nor`easters that have some devastating winds.
###486 Nor`easters and hurricanes are completely different, because they derive their energy
###493 from two completely different sources. Your hurricanes get your energy from the warm waters
###499 of the Atlantic Ocean, and that latent heat relays is what drives the engine. Once a hurricane
###505 goes on land, it loses its energy.
###507 A Nor`easter gets its energy from the differences between hot and cold. Often, a blizzard will
###514 come from a strong Nor`easter. And some cases, they can be one and the same. Blinding snow
###519 and wind, winds blowing 35-40 miles an hour. And obviously, devastating cold. And that`s
###525 why the strongest Nor`easters typically happen in fall and winter, when you have that dynamic
###529 contrast in temperatures.
###531 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###532 AZUZ: Well, finally today, we are going to talk about a ping-pong player that is a machine.
###537 Well, at least we warned you. This robotic returner is a ping-pong prodigy. It`s on display
###542 at an event in China. The robot`s eyes have cameras that collect images of the ball, and
###548 then it takes it 50 to 100 milliseconds to respond and hit the ball back. Actually it
###553 seems kind of like the ball is coming right to it. So, if you were to really challenge
###556 this thing, it might be in for some trouble. If it couldn`t keep up, it could be up the
###560 creek without a pedal. But for the engineers building it, they could still get some valuable
###564 information. And besides, it seems like they are doing pretty well, considering the net
###567 results so far.
###569 Coming up with puns like that is always a ball, and we really gave them our best shot,
###572 and now it`s time for us to go so, we will serve up more headlines tomorrow on CNN STUDENT
###577 NEWS.
