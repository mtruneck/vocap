1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,254



2
0:0:1,254 --> 0:0:2,86
DAVID MACMILLAN: I hate when
fucking people send me


3
0:0:2,86 --> 0:0:5,62
reservations on the
fucking phone.


4
0:0:5,62 --> 0:0:7,78
Because they've called Liverpool
House, they've


5
0:0:7,78 --> 0:0:9,41
called Joe Beef, they've
been on OpenTable.


6
0:0:9,41 --> 0:0:14,3



7
0:0:14,3 --> 0:0:17,57
You really have to dig around
to find my email.


8
0:0:17,57 --> 0:0:19,9
You have to be a bit psycho.


9
0:0:19,9 --> 0:0:21,97
And then you call me and say,
we'd like to be eight people


10
0:0:21,97 --> 0:0:23,34
on Saturday night
at 7 o'clock.


11
0:0:23,34 --> 0:0:25,58
It's like, dude.


12
0:0:25,58 --> 0:0:27,288
Fuck off.


13
0:0:27,288 --> 0:0:28,538
[LAUGHTER]


14
0:0:28,538 --> 0:0:45,88



15
0:0:45,88 --> 0:0:48,77
DAVID MACMILLAN: My name is
David McMillan, and I'm part


16
0:0:48,77 --> 0:0:51,95
owners of Joe Beef with my
partner Fred and Allison.


17
0:0:51,95 --> 0:0:53,4
Fred's like my brother.


18
0:0:53,4 --> 0:0:54,29
We're peas in a pod.


19
0:0:54,29 --> 0:0:56,73



20
0:0:56,73 --> 0:0:57,93
We think the same way
for some reason.


21
0:0:57,93 --> 0:0:59,52
We like the same things.


22
0:0:59,52 --> 0:1:1,58
We like the same aesthetic
and food.


23
0:1:1,58 --> 0:1:4,99
When we look at a space to open
a restaurant, it's not


24
0:1:4,99 --> 0:1:5,96
about, hey, we found a space.


25
0:1:5,96 --> 0:1:7,49
Let's open this modern
restaurant in it.


26
0:1:7,49 --> 0:1:9,63
It's about, what was
it like in this


27
0:1:9,63 --> 0:1:11,9
neighborhood 100 years ago?


28
0:1:11,9 --> 0:1:13,63
What will it be like in
100 years from now?


29
0:1:13,63 --> 0:1:16,77
You try to put on the shoe that
looks nice with the jean.


30
0:1:16,77 --> 0:1:18,69
You know what I'm saying?


31
0:1:18,69 --> 0:1:22,47
This neighborhood, I felt,
needed that oyster place where


32
0:1:22,47 --> 0:1:25,5
you can have a nice
piece of meat.


33
0:1:25,5 --> 0:1:27,7
I didn't want it to have a
New World wine program.


34
0:1:27,7 --> 0:1:28,92
I want an Old World
wine program.


35
0:1:28,92 --> 0:1:31,45
I only want French wine.


36
0:1:31,45 --> 0:1:33,23
I want to work from
the Market.


37
0:1:33,23 --> 0:1:34,44
We're right near
Atwater Market.


38
0:1:34,44 --> 0:1:37,48
It's important that we work with
Atwater Market, to fit


39
0:1:37,48 --> 0:1:39,205
into the community that's
Little Burgundy


40
0:1:39,205 --> 0:1:41,83
and to make it stronger.


41
0:1:41,83 --> 0:1:44,91
Fred's strong, strong, strong,
strong in the kitchen.


42
0:1:44,91 --> 0:1:47,51
Whereas I think I'm a bit
stronger, perhaps, in the room


43
0:1:47,51 --> 0:1:48,3
with the people.


44
0:1:48,3 --> 0:1:52,45
I've got the chat, the gift
of the gab, perhaps.


45
0:1:52,45 --> 0:1:54,64
Can you not do ice right
now, when I'm fucking


46
0:1:54,64 --> 0:1:56,19
talking on a camera?


47
0:1:56,19 --> 0:1:57,15
VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Sorry man.


48
0:1:57,15 --> 0:1:57,73
DAVID MACMILLAN: Sorry, dude.


49
0:1:57,73 --> 0:1:59,18
I didn't know it was you.


50
0:1:59,18 --> 0:2:3,62
I want to move pleasantries
aside quickly and just get to


51
0:2:3,62 --> 0:2:7,3
first name basis as
quick as possible.


52
0:2:7,3 --> 0:2:9,84
Let's get to know each other
real quick and have drinks.


53
0:2:9,84 --> 0:2:10,71
That's the thing, I think.


54
0:2:10,71 --> 0:2:11,67
Oh, it's [INAUDIBLE].


55
0:2:11,67 --> 0:2:14,72
What do you want?


56
0:2:14,72 --> 0:2:15,905
Eh?


57
0:2:15,905 --> 0:2:17,82
They've got to live it
up a little bit, eh?


58
0:2:17,82 --> 0:2:19,7
[FRENCH].


59
0:2:19,7 --> 0:2:20,55



60
0:2:20,55 --> 0:2:23,49
When you write a menu, and it's
fixed, and it says green


61
0:2:23,49 --> 0:2:25,16
peas on it-- there's not always


62
0:2:25,16 --> 0:2:27,9
green peas at the market.


63
0:2:27,9 --> 0:2:29,86
So working on the chalkboard and
changing the menu often,


64
0:2:29,86 --> 0:2:32,65
it's something that's
rampant now.


65
0:2:32,65 --> 0:2:35,1
It's just a way of
working closer


66
0:2:35,1 --> 0:2:37,19
with the Market, really.


67
0:2:37,19 --> 0:2:39,79
Vanya might as well
well be my--


68
0:2:39,79 --> 0:2:42,41
she's my business partner, but
not my business partner.


69
0:2:42,41 --> 0:2:44,59
For all practical purposes,
she should have been.


70
0:2:44,59 --> 0:2:48,755
And Marco, at his age, has an
incredible amount of talent.


71
0:2:48,755 --> 0:2:50,87
And he has his own voice
in the kitchen already.


72
0:2:50,87 --> 0:2:52,7
We can both see that,
Fred and I.


73
0:2:52,7 --> 0:2:55,49
MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER: Dessert
is basically a pavlova shaped


74
0:2:55,49 --> 0:2:57,11
as a baked potato.


75
0:2:57,11 --> 0:3:0,445
Meringue, parfait, ganache,
rum and water.


76
0:3:0,445 --> 0:3:2,63
And soft serve.


77
0:3:2,63 --> 0:3:5,38
Fake orange cheese, carrot
puree with gelatin.


78
0:3:5,38 --> 0:3:6,37
Mint.


79
0:3:6,37 --> 0:3:7,42
Hot chocolate sauce.


80
0:3:7,42 --> 0:3:8,67
There you go.


81
0:3:8,67 --> 0:3:11,31
DAVID MACMILLAN: It'd be nice to
see Marco develop, perhaps


82
0:3:11,31 --> 0:3:13,86
under Fred's watchful eye, for
a couple of years to come.


83
0:3:13,86 --> 0:3:17,27
But he'll definitely be
a very successful


84
0:3:17,27 --> 0:3:18,24
and very young chef.


85
0:3:18,24 --> 0:3:20,63
Let's get the [INAUDIBLE]
out of here.


86
0:3:20,63 --> 0:3:26,366



87
0:3:26,366 --> 0:3:27,322
MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER:
So where is Fred?


88
0:3:27,322 --> 0:3:29,118
DAVID MACMILLAN: Fred put
a nail in his hand.


89
0:3:29,118 --> 0:3:29,994
MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER:
Oh, yeah.


90
0:3:29,994 --> 0:3:30,432
MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER: Right?


91
0:3:30,432 --> 0:3:31,19
VANYA FILIPOVIC: Oh my god.


92
0:3:31,19 --> 0:3:32,84
MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER: And then
he got a blood infection.


93
0:3:32,84 --> 0:3:33,29
MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER: Yeah.


94
0:3:33,29 --> 0:3:35,31
DAVID MACMILLAN: He's had to go
to hospital every day for


95
0:3:35,31 --> 0:3:37,15
five days and take an IV drip.


96
0:3:37,15 --> 0:3:37,74
MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER:
So that's why


97
0:3:37,74 --> 0:3:38,62
he's not here today.


98
0:3:38,62 --> 0:3:43,22
DAVID MACMILLAN: So we're going
to Park, Antonio Park's


99
0:3:43,22 --> 0:3:44,1
restaurant.


100
0:3:44,1 --> 0:3:47,936
And we're going to have
some Korean pickles.


101
0:3:47,936 --> 0:3:51,21
Or maybe four slices of tuna.


102
0:3:51,21 --> 0:3:52,49
I love sushi.


103
0:3:52,49 --> 0:3:53,55
It's my favorite food.


104
0:3:53,55 --> 0:3:57,42
I like raw fish and
crabs and seafood.


105
0:3:57,42 --> 0:3:59,675
Antonio just brings a different
thing to it.


106
0:3:59,675 --> 0:4:2,92
He always has creative takes
and tasty flavors.


107
0:4:2,92 --> 0:4:4,25
He's an interesting character.


108
0:4:4,25 --> 0:4:5,69
He's a kind of funny boy.


109
0:4:5,69 --> 0:4:7,43
ANTONIO PARK: Hi, my name is
Antonio Park, and this is my


110
0:4:7,43 --> 0:4:8,47
restaurant, Park.


111
0:4:8,47 --> 0:4:12,39
I do, let's say, cuisines de
marche, so market food.


112
0:4:12,39 --> 0:4:14,79
But influenced with my own
cultures, which is


113
0:4:14,79 --> 0:4:17,89
Argentinian, Japanese, Korean.


114
0:4:17,89 --> 0:4:17,81
It's all mixed up.


115
0:4:17,81 --> 0:4:20,94
But we take the source
and just bring it all


116
0:4:20,94 --> 0:4:22,74
together in one plate.


117
0:4:22,74 --> 0:4:24,65
Dave is difficult.


118
0:4:24,65 --> 0:4:26,45
But there's certain things that
he likes, and you just


119
0:4:26,45 --> 0:4:28,9
have to focus on those
things that he likes.


120
0:4:28,9 --> 0:4:29,27
Like albacore tuna.


121
0:4:29,27 --> 0:4:30,18
He likes pickles.


122
0:4:30,18 --> 0:4:33,59
He like greens, vegetables, and
all the other that comes


123
0:4:33,59 --> 0:4:34,63
out of the ground.


124
0:4:34,63 --> 0:4:35,105
DAVID MACMILLAN: That's an
excellent [INAUDIBLE].


125
0:4:35,105 --> 0:4:36,11
ANTONIO PARK: That's
who he is.


126
0:4:36,11 --> 0:4:39,22
That's who he is.


127
0:4:39,22 --> 0:4:40,77
DAVID MACMILLAN: So what
is this, buddy?


128
0:4:40,77 --> 0:4:43,1
ANTONIO PARK: So it's
topside albacore.


129
0:4:43,1 --> 0:4:45,31
Topside albacore tuna,
sashimi on top of it.


130
0:4:45,31 --> 0:4:48,63
And then you have, underneath,
you have a kimchi coleslaw.


131
0:4:48,63 --> 0:4:50,7
DAVID MACMILLAN: Antonio, for
real, this is delicious.


132
0:4:50,7 --> 0:4:50,87
ANTONIO PARK: Thank you.


133
0:4:50,87 --> 0:4:51,94
VANYA FILIPOVIC: Do
you eat kimchi any


134
0:4:51,94 --> 0:4:52,795
other time than here?


135
0:4:52,795 --> 0:4:53,9
DAVID MACMILLAN: Yeah.


136
0:4:53,9 --> 0:4:56,53
I love Korean food.


137
0:4:56,53 --> 0:4:58,25
That's it, we're leaving.


138
0:4:58,25 --> 0:4:59,39
ANTONIO PARK: One more,
one more slice.


139
0:4:59,39 --> 0:4:59,45
DAVID MACMILLAN: No, no, no.


140
0:4:59,45 --> 0:4:59,97
We're leaving.


141
0:4:59,97 --> 0:5:1,9
ANTONIO PARK: One more
[INAUDIBLE].


142
0:5:1,9 --> 0:5:1,56
DAVID MACMILLAN: No.


143
0:5:1,56 --> 0:5:3,82
ANTONIO PARK: One more.


144
0:5:3,82 --> 0:5:5,46
Lobster and chorizo.


145
0:5:5,46 --> 0:5:6,77
Argentinian-style.


146
0:5:6,77 --> 0:5:7,72
DAVID MACMILLAN:
Argentinian-style?


147
0:5:7,72 --> 0:5:8,94
ANTONIO PARK: Yup.


148
0:5:8,94 --> 0:5:10,44
DAVID MACMILLAN: He's good.


149
0:5:10,44 --> 0:5:12,4
I always enjoy eating there.


150
0:5:12,4 --> 0:5:14,93
He's a sweet kid.


151
0:5:14,93 --> 0:5:18,44
The Argentinian-Korean maniac.


152
0:5:18,44 --> 0:5:18,88
I love you.


153
0:5:18,88 --> 0:5:20,23
ANTONIO PARK: I love you baby.


154
0:5:20,23 --> 0:5:21,48
VANYA FILIPOVIC: Thanks
for the snack.


155
0:5:21,48 --> 0:5:24,59



156
0:5:24,59 --> 0:5:25,8
DAVID MACMILLAN: That was
just really crazy good.


157
0:5:25,8 --> 0:5:26,264
Thank you.


158
0:5:26,264 --> 0:5:26,728
ANTONIO PARK: All right.


159
0:5:26,728 --> 0:5:28,12
Thank you.


160
0:5:28,12 --> 0:5:30,67
DAVID MACMILLAN: I always tell
people, you have to work hard


161
0:5:30,67 --> 0:5:34,84
at not burning bridges.


162
0:5:34,84 --> 0:5:35,11
Come on.


163
0:5:35,11 --> 0:5:36,36
Let's go, guys.


164
0:5:36,36 --> 0:5:40,16



165
0:5:40,16 --> 0:5:41,53
Nora Gray.


166
0:5:41,53 --> 0:5:43,77
When we opened Liverpool House,
and Ryan was my dining


167
0:5:43,77 --> 0:5:45,9
room manager, and Emma was the
chef, and they worked there


168
0:5:45,9 --> 0:5:47,51
for six years.


169
0:5:47,51 --> 0:5:51,425
And in that six year period, I
always said to them that one


170
0:5:51,425 --> 0:5:52,48
day you're going
to leave here.


171
0:5:52,48 --> 0:5:53,3
Don't make a mistake.


172
0:5:53,3 --> 0:5:54,58
Leave here properly.


173
0:5:54,58 --> 0:5:56,46
When they opened their
restaurant, they were very


174
0:5:56,46 --> 0:5:57,79
respectful.


175
0:5:57,79 --> 0:5:59,56
It doesn't look like Joe Beef.


176
0:5:59,56 --> 0:6:1,94
It's Ryan's own vision
of the restaurant.


177
0:6:1,94 --> 0:6:5,19
The food doesn't seem like Joe
Beef or Liverpool House food.


178
0:6:5,19 --> 0:6:6,41
It's Emma's own food.


179
0:6:6,41 --> 0:6:8,31
Some people have left here--


180
0:6:8,31 --> 0:6:10,49
to remain nameless--


181
0:6:10,49 --> 0:6:15,596
and just done Joe Beef, up in
the East End, verbatim.


182
0:6:15,596 --> 0:6:18,47



183
0:6:18,47 --> 0:6:24,16
And those guys, today, don't
even exist because they don't


184
0:6:24,16 --> 0:6:25,8
play with all the
other reindeers.


185
0:6:25,8 --> 0:6:27,45
RYAN GRAY: Hey, my name
is Ryan Gray.


186
0:6:27,45 --> 0:6:30,96
I'm one of the co-owners of
Nora Gray restaurant.


187
0:6:30,96 --> 0:6:34,6
We specialize in southern
Italian food.


188
0:6:34,6 --> 0:6:36,83
Basically the kind of food that
you wish that your mother


189
0:6:36,83 --> 0:6:39,46
made when you were growing up.


190
0:6:39,46 --> 0:6:40,77
EMMA CARDARELLI: This
is a bechamel sauce


191
0:6:40,77 --> 0:6:41,98
with Fontina in it.


192
0:6:41,98 --> 0:6:43,21
It's got a lot of nutmeg.


193
0:6:43,21 --> 0:6:44,37
Grilled radicchio.


194
0:6:44,37 --> 0:6:47,52
Poached pears, which we finish
off on the grill, and then we


195
0:6:47,52 --> 0:6:51,33
mix with parsley salad, candied
walnuts, fresh ground


196
0:6:51,33 --> 0:6:53,35
pepper, and olive oil.


197
0:6:53,35 --> 0:6:55,75
RYAN GRAY: So that's tortelloni
with yellow beets


198
0:6:55,75 --> 0:6:57,155
inside and Gorgonzola.


199
0:6:57,155 --> 0:6:58,96
DAVID MACMILLAN: Wow,
that's gorgeous.


200
0:6:58,96 --> 0:7:2,3
Really beautiful [INAUDIBLE].


201
0:7:2,3 --> 0:7:5,122
RYAN GRAY: And this is the
wild mushroom cavatelli.


202
0:7:5,122 --> 0:7:6,52
DAVID MACMILLAN:
Wild mushrooms?


203
0:7:6,52 --> 0:7:7,8
RYAN GRAY: Yeah.


204
0:7:7,8 --> 0:7:8,86
They're totally wild.


205
0:7:8,86 --> 0:7:11,6
They're out of control.


206
0:7:11,6 --> 0:7:12,7
DAVID MACMILLAN: Ryan's
always a hoot.


207
0:7:12,7 --> 0:7:13,69
I love sitting at the
bar with Ryan.


208
0:7:13,69 --> 0:7:16,9
RYAN GRAY: Cheers, guys.


209
0:7:16,9 --> 0:7:17,42
Thank you for coming tonight.


210
0:7:17,42 --> 0:7:18,13
Thank you.


211
0:7:18,13 --> 0:7:19,1
Thank you.


212
0:7:19,1 --> 0:7:20,54
DAVID MACMILLAN: His life's
mission is to


213
0:7:20,54 --> 0:7:23,51
pour wine for me.


214
0:7:23,51 --> 0:7:25,16
We're going to NDG.


215
0:7:25,16 --> 0:7:26,132
Let's go.


216
0:7:26,132 --> 0:7:26,624
RYAN GRAY: NDG.


217
0:7:26,624 --> 0:7:27,116
VANYA FILIPOVIC: NDG.


218
0:7:27,116 --> 0:7:29,58
No Damn Good.


219
0:7:29,58 --> 0:7:32,13
RYAN GRAY: NDG is a neighborhood
in the West End


220
0:7:32,13 --> 0:7:38,12
of Montreal that was an Irish
working class neighborhood, as


221
0:7:38,12 --> 0:7:42,64
is Little Burgundy,
Griffintown.


222
0:7:42,64 --> 0:7:44,57
And there is one bar--


223
0:7:44,57 --> 0:7:46,382
DAVID MACMILLAN: Honey
fucking Martin's.


224
0:7:46,382 --> 0:7:48,24
I'm home.


225
0:7:48,24 --> 0:7:53,33
RYAN GRAY: The quintessential
best Irish bar in Montreal.


226
0:7:53,33 --> 0:7:56,15
DAVID MACMILLAN: I'd say it's
the best Irish bar in Canada.


227
0:7:56,15 --> 0:8:2,17
There's not a bar that has
better quality oil paintings


228
0:8:2,17 --> 0:8:3,93
of historic boxers.


229
0:8:3,93 --> 0:8:6,65
And all of the furniture inside
Honey Martin's, to be


230
0:8:6,65 --> 0:8:11,36
noted, nothing has nails.


231
0:8:11,36 --> 0:8:12,75
It's all tongue and groove.


232
0:8:12,75 --> 0:8:14,91
It's an amazing bar.


233
0:8:14,91 --> 0:8:17,65
RYAN GRAY: Mikey!


234
0:8:17,65 --> 0:8:18,902
Campari soda.


235
0:8:18,902 --> 0:8:20,29
How about that?


236
0:8:20,29 --> 0:8:21,59
DAVID MACMILLAN: That's
the bottle.


237
0:8:21,59 --> 0:8:24,1
It still has the old
stamp on it.


238
0:8:24,1 --> 0:8:27,62
RYAN GRAY: Mikey drinks
Campari nonstop.


239
0:8:27,62 --> 0:8:29,49
Mikey is a Campari fiend.


240
0:8:29,49 --> 0:8:30,43
DAVID MACMILLAN: All right.


241
0:8:30,43 --> 0:8:31,42
Campari sodas.


242
0:8:31,42 --> 0:8:32,67
RYAN GRAY: All around.


243
0:8:32,67 --> 0:8:35,49



244
0:8:35,49 --> 0:8:35,88
DAVID MACMILLAN: Maybe
we're painting the


245
0:8:35,88 --> 0:8:37,574
wrong picture of Montreal.


246
0:8:37,574 --> 0:8:42,48
I'm a proud Montrealer, but
I am one of the 8% percent


247
0:8:42,48 --> 0:8:46,28
minority of Anglophone
Montrealers.


248
0:8:46,28 --> 0:8:49,13
We're at Montreal's
most Irish pub.


249
0:8:49,13 --> 0:8:52,94
And now we're going to
Montreal's most London pub.


250
0:8:52,94 --> 0:8:54,32
I'm so fat.


251
0:8:54,32 --> 0:8:56,27
I can't even fit out of
minivans anymore.


252
0:8:56,27 --> 0:9:4,4



253
0:9:4,4 --> 0:9:4,65
RYAN GRAY: Dude.


254
0:9:4,65 --> 0:9:6,17
I did not break your phone.


255
0:9:6,17 --> 0:9:12,1



256
0:9:12,1 --> 0:9:13,17
I did not break your phone.


257
0:9:13,17 --> 0:9:15,786
I did not break your phone!


258
0:9:15,786 --> 0:9:16,75
VANYA FILIPOVIC: Did
you just break it?


259
0:9:16,75 --> 0:9:18,16
RYAN GRAY: No, I did not
break his phone.


260
0:9:18,16 --> 0:9:21,52



261
0:9:21,52 --> 0:9:22,33
Is it working?


262
0:9:22,33 --> 0:9:25,3
Tell me it's working.


263
0:9:25,3 --> 0:9:27,18
DAVID MACMILLAN: We're at
Burgundy Lion fucking pub.


264
0:9:27,18 --> 0:9:29,225
It's a pub across the
street from Joe Beef


265
0:9:29,225 --> 0:9:30,0
and Liverpool House.


266
0:9:30,0 --> 0:9:33,1
If you look at the bottles
behind you, there's a solid


267
0:9:33,1 --> 0:9:34,62
scotch whisky program here.


268
0:9:34,62 --> 0:9:38,9
The neighborhood became a
neighborhood when Toby and his


269
0:9:38,9 --> 0:9:43,28
partners, Paul and Jean-Michel,
opened this pub.


270
0:9:43,28 --> 0:9:45,63
So now today, people come
here for lunch, and


271
0:9:45,63 --> 0:9:47,24
it's full all afternoon.


272
0:9:47,24 --> 0:9:50,2
We come here at 3 o'clock,
4 o'clock, 5 o'clock.


273
0:9:50,2 --> 0:9:51,67
It's packed at 6:00.


274
0:9:51,67 --> 0:9:53,8
And it's packed at fucking
2:00 in the morning.


275
0:9:53,8 --> 0:9:55,78
Toby.


276
0:9:55,78 --> 0:9:58,22
We're a bit drunk, and we've
been out a lot, but we're


277
0:9:58,22 --> 0:10:1,34
going to cut smoked meat
sandwiches off the bar on a


278
0:10:1,34 --> 0:10:2,311
whole brisket.


279
0:10:2,311 --> 0:10:2,782
TOBY LYLE: All right.


280
0:10:2,782 --> 0:10:3,724
DAVID MACMILLAN: Are you in?


281
0:10:3,724 --> 0:10:4,195
TOBY LYLE: Of course.


282
0:10:4,195 --> 0:10:4,67
DAVID MACMILLAN: All right.


283
0:10:4,67 --> 0:10:5,69
TOBY LYLE: Hey, crew, let's
go to Liverpool.


284
0:10:5,69 --> 0:10:8,61
DAVID MACMILLAN: The smoked meat
sandwiches, I think, for


285
0:10:8,61 --> 0:10:10,77
us it's like picnic food.


286
0:10:10,77 --> 0:10:11,85
Who doesn't love Schwartz's?


287
0:10:11,85 --> 0:10:15,6
We all get excited just to drive
up to that neighborhood,


288
0:10:15,6 --> 0:10:17,86
you get excited.


289
0:10:17,86 --> 0:10:19,73
We've been cooking with
brisket for years


290
0:10:19,73 --> 0:10:22,6
and years and years.


291
0:10:22,6 --> 0:10:23,89
And there's nothing more
beautiful than a whole brisket


292
0:10:23,89 --> 0:10:25,13
on a piece of wood.


293
0:10:25,13 --> 0:10:28,38
And slicing little sandwiches
from it is delicious.


294
0:10:28,38 --> 0:10:29,68
Everybody gets excited, right?


295
0:10:29,68 --> 0:10:30,3
VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.


296
0:10:30,3 --> 0:10:31,43
DAVID MACMILLAN: You could bring
anything out, but people


297
0:10:31,43 --> 0:10:32,3
are like, bah!


298
0:10:32,3 --> 0:10:33,41
Smoked meat sandwiches!


299
0:10:33,41 --> 0:10:36,62
VOICE (OFFSCREEN):
Oui, monsieur!


300
0:10:36,62 --> 0:10:37,759
DAVID MACMILLAN:
Good job, boys.


301
0:10:37,759 --> 0:10:39,9
Snack time.


302
0:10:39,9 --> 0:10:43,99



303
0:10:43,99 --> 0:10:45,24
Who wants a sammie?


304
0:10:45,24 --> 0:10:49,41



305
0:10:49,41 --> 0:10:53,25
All the old Hebrew things in
Montreal are killer, like


306
0:10:53,25 --> 0:10:55,65
Wolinsky's, and still
Moishe's.


307
0:10:55,65 --> 0:10:56,75
Moishe's is killer.


308
0:10:56,75 --> 0:11:0,9
And Schwartz's.' Or even any
smoked meat, really.


309
0:11:0,9 --> 0:11:3,21
And people say now today, smoked
meat, it's not what it


310
0:11:3,21 --> 0:11:3,82
used to be.


311
0:11:3,82 --> 0:11:4,98
Some people don't
even smoke it.


312
0:11:4,98 --> 0:11:5,95
Blah blah blah.


313
0:11:5,95 --> 0:11:6,94
But I don't care.


314
0:11:6,94 --> 0:11:9,595
There's something about having
just a smoked meat sandwich on


315
0:11:9,595 --> 0:11:12,62
rye bread with that
yellow mustard.


316
0:11:12,62 --> 0:11:14,77
Smoked meat's delicious on
scallops, it's delicious on


317
0:11:14,77 --> 0:11:17,82
liver, it's delicious
with kidneys.


318
0:11:17,82 --> 0:11:23,21
It's delicious cold on its
own with celery root.


319
0:11:23,21 --> 0:11:25,36
It's not just a sandwich
stuffer.


320
0:11:25,36 --> 0:11:26,99
We cook it, we do
the Joe Beef--


321
0:11:26,99 --> 0:11:29,61
the liver with a slice of smoked
meat on it, and three


322
0:11:29,61 --> 0:11:30,58
little slices of pickles.


323
0:11:30,58 --> 0:11:31,83
It's wonderful food.


324
0:11:31,83 --> 0:11:34,47



325
0:11:34,47 --> 0:11:35,965
Smoked meat's the best meat.


326
0:11:35,965 --> 0:11:39,686



327
0:11:39,686 --> 0:11:43,44
RYAN GRAY: I don't know
any better meat.


328
0:11:43,44 --> 0:11:44,32
DAVID MACMILLAN: Out of all
the meats, it's the


329
0:11:44,32 --> 0:11:45,57
finest of the meats.


330
0:11:45,57 --> 0:11:50,93



331
0:11:50,93 --> 0:11:51,91
That's what Montreal is.


332
0:11:51,91 --> 0:11:52,93
The bagels, too.


333
0:11:52,93 --> 0:11:54,6
Super good.


334
0:11:54,6 --> 0:11:56,0
I'm always talking about that.


335
0:11:56,0 --> 0:11:57,92
It always comes back to those
things, but it's true.


336
0:11:57,92 --> 0:11:58,854
Thank you everybody!


337
0:11:58,854 --> 0:12:1,189
[CHEERING]


338
0:12:1,189 --> 0:12:2,16
VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Thank
you so much!


339
0:12:2,16 --> 0:12:3,882
DAVID MACMILLAN: Make some
noise with the glasses.


340
0:12:3,882 --> 0:12:7,85
[CHEERING]


341
0:12:7,85 --> 0:12:9,1
DAVID MACMILLAN: Montreal
smoked meat!


342
0:12:9,1 --> 0:14:9,1
