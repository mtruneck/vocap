0:0:9,41 --> 0:0:13,43
So I'm going to make this beautiful mushroom
risotto. Slightly different twist on the tale.


2
0:0:13,43 --> 0:0:18,96
So sofrito's the base. It's chopped white
onions and a little bit of celery. And then


3
0:0:18,96 --> 0:0:25,31
I want to add the risotto rice. I'm using
arborio rice, you can use carnaroli. A handful


4
0:0:25,31 --> 0:0:30,779
per person.
Now while that's doing that, here I've got


5
0:0:30,779 --> 0:0:35,39
some dried porchini. So what I'm going to
do is get a bit of my stock. So I'm just going


6
0:0:35,39 --> 0:0:40,14
to give them a couple of minutes.
So my rice is sounding a little hot, and what


7
0:0:40,14 --> 0:0:45,53
I'm going to do and you could use white wine
at this stage, but I'm going to use vermouth


8
0:0:45,53 --> 0:0:49,579
which is absolutely fantastic.
Now as soon as that's gone in we want to stop


9
0:0:49,579 --> 0:0:56,559
the frying and we want to go into risotto
mode adding small ladles of stock every minute


10
0:0:56,559 --> 0:1:3,399
or so and giving it a little stir up.
Literally after a minute, right, beautiful


11
0:1:3,399 --> 0:1:10,649
porchini and look in there. I mean already
chicken stock and dried mushroom taste is


12
0:1:10,649 --> 0:1:13,25
incredible.
In with the mushroom stock. Now here, look.


13
0:1:13,25 --> 0:1:18,3
Here on the board just chop them up and straight
in every last bit.


14
0:1:18,3 --> 0:1:22,209
All I have to do now is keep adding stock
and stirring it. Massaging out all the starch


15
0:1:22,209 --> 0:1:26,209
until it's ready.
Now while that's just finishing off, here


16
0:1:26,209 --> 0:1:31,2
I've got some lovely wild mushrooms. I've
got the girolle, pied de mouton, chanterelle,


17
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:36,92
with the mushrooms, what I want to do is I
want to put them dry in and around this screaming


18
0:1:36,92 --> 0:1:41,2
hot griddle pan.
Risotto is done. What I need to do definitely


19
0:1:41,2 --> 0:1:48,99
while it's hot is get a knob of butter. I
want a nice handful of Parmesan, going to


20
0:1:48,99 --> 0:1:57,42
mix this up. Beat that up. Lid, let it chill
out. Whilst that off the heat, let's have


21
0:1:57,42 --> 0:2:3,52
a little look over here.
These mushrooms should be toasted. I'm going


22
0:2:3,52 --> 0:2:8,259
to get these mushrooms, I'm going to pick
some nice herbs. I love chervill, very, very


23
0:2:8,259 --> 0:2:14,5
nice. I've got some parsley, tarragon. Most
of that in there, leave a bit for garnish.


24
0:2:14,5 --> 0:2:24,12
Now, tiny bit of oil. Now let's get a lemon.
Squeeze half that lemon into there, while


25
0:2:24,12 --> 0:2:30,4
these are nice and warm and while the risotto
is resting. Let's plate it up. Lovely.


26
0:2:30,4 --> 0:2:39,72
Just spoon this on beautiful risotto. Beautiful
look at that. And then we get a little handful


27
0:2:39,72 --> 0:2:44,97
of our beautiful mushrooms and we just splay
them all over the top like that.


28
0:2:44,97 --> 0:2:49,64
Then I get get a little knob of butter and
put that in the middle there and it will start


29
0:2:49,64 --> 0:2:53,88
to melt. Now just give it a tiny, tiny little
grate.


30
0:2:53,88 --> 0:4:53,88
Look at that.
