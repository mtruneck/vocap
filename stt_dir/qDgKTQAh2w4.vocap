###0 <i> Narrator: Across  the country,</i>
###2 <i> ordinary Americans from  all walks of life are</i>

###7 Braxton Southwick: My family is preparing
###9 for a biological terrorist attack.
###11 Bryan May: For the New Madrid earthquake.
###13 Wilma Bryant: For a series of F-5 tornados.
###15 <i> Narrator: And  protect themselves.</i>
###17 Aton Edwards: Watch it Tim,

###19 Cameron Moore: Stop right there!
###20 <i> Narrator: From what they  perceive is the fast</i>
###21 <i> approaching end of the  world as we know it.</i>
###28 Jayden Southwick: Dad!
###29 Braxton Southwick: Leave her alone!
###33 <i> Narrator: Next, we go  inside the lives of two</i>
###35 <i> committed preppers,  who have devised an</i>
###37 <i> extensive plan,  gone to great lengths.</i>
###42 Tom: Come right here!
###45 <i> Narrator: And made huge  personal sacrifices,</i>
###47 <i> to ensure their  very survival.</i>
###50 <i> And take on the  apocalypse, together.</i>
###53 Steve: This is not the plan!
###54 Let us the hell in!
###57 <i> Narrator: The experts  will assess their preps,</i>
###59 <i> to see if they  have what it takes.</i>
###60 Steven: Target acquired Tom.
###64 <i> Narrator:  To survive.</i>
###65 Tom: Bring on the terrorists.
###69 <i> Narrator: This is  Doomsday Preppers.</i>
###85 <i> Dr. Tom Perez is a  retired chiropractor,</i>
###88 <i> who lives in  Houston, Texas</i>
###90 <i> with his wife Monica  and their three kids.</i>
###93 Tom: I have a daughter by the name of Kat.
###95 Our son Thomas is 12 years old
###98 and we have Matthew, the youngest.
###101 <i> Narrator: The Perez's  built their 6800 square</i>
###103 <i> foot home in an upscale  neighborhood near good</i>
###106 <i> schools and  high-end shopping.</i>
###109 <i> But Tom's trained his  family to give up their</i>
###111 <i> life of luxury in  a moment's notice.</i>
###115 Tom: We do not plan to stay in Houston;
###117 we plan to bug out as quickly
###120 and efficiently as we can.
###123 I'm preparing for a terroristic attack.
###128 On your knees!
###129 Man: Please.
###137 <i> Narrator: Tom fears  the dirty bomb.</i>
###140 <i> An everyday explosive,  like dynamite or TNT,</i>
###143 <i> packed with  radioactive material.</i>
###148 <i> Once detonated, its blast  can spread radiation</i>
###151 <i> anywhere from a city block  to several square miles.</i>
###155 <i> But that radioactive  debris could lodge in</i>
###157 <i> buildings, and chemically  bind with concrete and</i>
###160 <i> asphalt, making  decontaminating a city</i>
###162 <i> difficult, and possibly  forcing affected</i>
###165 <i> neighborhoods  to be abandoned.</i>
###166 Tom: If a dirty bomb exploded in the Houston
###169 metroplex area there would be disarray.
###172 There would be people yelling,
###173 screaming, shooting.
###175 There could be looting, home invasions.
###177 People would do things they normally wouldn't do.
###181 I do not want to be around that and
###183 I do not want to put my family at risk.
###189 <i> Narrator: Because Tom  fears Houston could be</i>
###190 <i> uninhabitable after a  dirty bomb explosion,</i>
###193 <i> his entire prepping plan  begins with bugging out.</i>
###197 Tom: If the (bleep) hit the fan I
###200 would definitely get out of there.
###205 We practice how quickly we can get out of our
###207 homestead and load up our goods,
###210 so we can get out of Houston.
###212 <i> Narrator: The fastest  Tom and his family have</i>
###214 <i> bugged out of their  home is 10 minutes,</i>
###216 <i> a drill they usually  practice twice a month.</i>
###219 Matthew: Hurry, hurry.
###221 Tom: Get strapped in, okay buddy?
###222 <i> Narrator: Today  is the start of</i>
###224 <i> their 3rd drill  this year.</i>
###226 Tom: You got everything?
###227 You got your gun?
###231 That's bugging out.
###235 <i> Narrator: Tom's bug out  route bypasses over</i>
###237 <i> 3,000 miles of  Houston's highways and</i>
###240 <i> once on the open road,</i>
###242 <i> they travel due west  to their safe house.</i>
###244 <i> 300 miles away in  Brackettville, Texas.</i>
###249 Tom: We have prepped for many years
###250 to go to a compound.
###252 <i> Narrator: It's normally a  six-hour drive to Tom's</i>
###254 <i> compound, but he  believes it could take</i>
###256 <i> as many as 21 hours, if  the other two million</i>
###259 <i> Houstonians are also  attempting to flee.</i>
###263 <i> As a result, Tom  has three back-up,</i>
###265 <i> bug-out routes.</i>
###267 Tom: You cannot over prepare for a disaster.
###273 <i> Narrator: The Perez's  bug out compound is</i>
###275 <i> 700 acres bigger  than 100 square</i>
###278 <i> New York City blocks.</i>
###280 <i> Tom's nicknamed  his compound and</i>
###282 <i> its two limestone  homes "the Alamo."</i>
###288 Tom: This is what we consider our last stand.
###291 <i> Narrator: The original  Alamo in San Antonio is</i>
###293 <i> synonymous with  a last stand</i>
###295 <i> against  impossible odds.</i>
###297 <i> If the Perez's ever  come under siege,</i>
###299 <i> Tom wants to  ensure they don't</i>
###300 <i> suffer the same fate.</i>
###302 <i> So he's spent 10 years  and more than two million</i>
###305 <i> dollars turning his Alamo  into a veritable fortress.</i>
###312 Tom: I designed it, set up the security for it.
###314 We have layers of security,
###316 such as solid steel bars on the windows,
###319 we have alarms.
###322 <i> Narrator: Tom's Alamo  is fortified with</i>
###323 <i> seven-inch thick,  bulletproof walls.</i>
###326 <i> Surrounding it is four  miles of seven-foot tall</i>
###329 <i> barbed wire fencing.</i>
###331 <i> And beyond that is the  Chihuahuan desert;</i>
###334 <i> the largest desert  in North America.</i>
###336 Tom: It is a harsh terrain.
###338 It would be hard for individuals
###340 to come across this barren area.
###343 That's why we decided to have this
###344 as our safe bug out area.
###347 For me prepping is not an obsession,
###350 it's therapeutic.
###352 When I pass our gates here,
###354 my blood pressure drops 8 to 10 points.
###358 <i> Narrator: But  not before Tom</i>
###359 <i> performs a  security check.</i>
###364 <i> The rest of the family  must wait in the vehicle</i>
###366 <i> until Tom determines  it's safe to enter.</i>
###373 <i> Tom modeled his security  check strategy after a</i>
###376 <i> SWAT team technique called  "deliberate entry."</i>
###380 Anyone in here?
###382 <i> Narrator: Which  is typically used</i>
###383 <i> in narcotic raids  when the exact</i>
###384 <i> location of a  threat is unknown.</i>
###387 Tom: Anyone in here?
###401 Okay, cabin one secure.
###406 <i> Narrator: Once the  cabins are secure,</i>
###407 <i> Tom makes sure  every other part of</i>
###409 <i> his plan is in  working order.</i>
###413 Tom: I spend approximately five hours,
###417 six hours a day determining what
###420 I have prepped.
###421 We investigate, modify, exchange, sell,
###425 to have the most current available MRE meals,
###428 rifles, ammunition.
###430 Prepping is infinite.
###431 <i> Narrator: Tom  maintains about</i>
###433 <i> 46,000 rounds  of ammunition;</i>
###435 <i> enough bullets to  shoot every person</i>
###438 <i> in the county  12 times.</i>
###440 <i> But all of Tom's preps  play a defensive role,</i>
###443 <i> even his food and water.</i>
###446 <i> The Perez's have a  nine-month supply of food</i>
###448 <i> at the ranch, but not all  of it is safe to eat.</i>
###452 Tom: I also have taken the liberty of
###457 contaminating 10% of my food and water supply.
###460 If it is ever compromised, I'm the only one that
###463 knows which supplies are affected.
###471 <i> Narrator: Tom wants his  toxic supplies to be an</i>
###474 <i> unwelcome surprise  to anyone foolish</i>
###476 <i> enough to storm  the Alamo.</i>
###479 <i> But while most preppers  might consider</i>
###481 <i> contaminating water  counter intuitive,</i>
###483 <i> Tom isn't worried  because he has an</i>
###485 <i> almost endless  supply.</i>
###487 Tom: This is my lifeline for water.
###490 <i> Narrator: Tom  strategically built his</i>
###492 <i> ranch above the  Edwards aquifer,</i>
###493 <i> an underground water  source roughly 10 times</i>
###496 <i> larger than the  city of Los Angeles.</i>
###500 <i> The aquifer provides  water to close to</i>
###502 <i> two million Texans  everyday and</i>
###505 <i> Tom has his own  personal access.</i>
###508 <i> His 45-foot tall windmill  draws water directly up</i>
###511 <i> from 1,000 feet  below ground and</i>
###513 <i> can pump 11,000  gallons a day.</i>
###517 Tom: As long as the aquifers are
###519 energized by rainfall we should have
###522 adequate water for many years to come.
###527 <i> Narrator: If the Alamo  ever comes under attack,</i>
###530 <i> and the windmill  is damaged,</i>
###531 <i> Tom's main water supply  could be cut off,</i>
###534 <i> so he has a reserve  supply of more than</i>
###536 <i> 2,000 gallons in  concrete tanks.</i>
###539 Tom: I coulda gone with plastic tanks,
###541 woulda been a lot easier, a lot cheaper.
###544 <i> Narrator: Unlike plastic,  concrete is fire resistant</i>
###546 <i> and Tom believes it  will keep his water</i>
###548 <i> protected against  incendiary bombs,</i>
###551 <i> such as Molotov  cocktails.</i>
###553 <i> To test his theory, he's  making his own brand of</i>
###555 <i> Molotov cocktail from a  secret recipe of ordinary</i>
###558 <i> household items,  like high proof alcohol</i>
###562 <i> and detergent.</i>
###564 Tom: Torch fuel, don't leave home without it.
###567 <i> Narrator: Tom's goal  is to make his custom</i>
###569 <i> recipe produce a longer  lasting flame that can</i>
###572 <i> stick to a target,</i>
###574 <i> similar to the  effects of napalm.</i>
###576 Tom: Now that's a good Molotov cocktail.
###579 <i> Narrator: With the help  of local law enforcement,</i>
###581 <i> he's ready to test it  for the first time,</i>
###583 <i> to prove his tank is  in fact fireproof.</i>
###587 Tom: Bring on the terrorists.
###605 From what I've seen after numerous examples
###608 of these explosives, it's built to last.
###614 It can take a licking and
###616 will keep on storing water.
###620 <i> Narrator: If survivors of  a dirty bomb attack do</i>
###623 <i> penetrate every layer  of Tom's security,</i>
###626 <i> he has a last line of  defense, his family.</i>
###630 Tom: How would you defend the door?
###631 What would you do,
###632 since we've been talking about it?
###633 Matthew: Shoot through the window.
###635 <i> Narrator: Tom  knows he can't</i>
###636 <i> defend the  Alamo alone.</i>
###638 <i> So he's been training  17-year-old Kat,</i>
###640 <i> 12-year-old Tommy, and  six-year-old Matthew</i>
###643 <i> how to use  various firearms.</i>
###646 Tom: If you're going to talk to your children
###647 about drugs, talk to them about prepping.
###649 It's no different.
###653 <i> Narrator: Matthew,  who has been shooting</i>
###655 <i> since the age of four,  can hit a target from</i>
###657 <i> 100 yards  away with his</i>
###658 <i> child-sized  sniping rifle.</i>
###661 Matthew: Really prepared for,
###663 like invasion or something.
###666 Tommy: He's not like other dads.
###668 He teaches us many tactical ways to survive.
###672 Tom: Wow, that is good.
###674 Katarina: He's very smart, very smart.
###677 You know we're always, like, on our toes.
###679 Monica: He orchestrates pretty
###680 much everything as far as keeping us safe.
###684 <i> Narrator: Because  Tom wants his family</i>
###685 <i> ready at all times,</i>
###687 <i> he drills their defense  skills weekly.</i>
###689 Tom: Alright hold my spot.
###690 <i> Narrator: So, today he's  asked off-duty officers</i>
###693 <i> from the local  sheriff's department</i>
###695 <i> to ambush  their home.</i>
###698 <i> Without telling  his three kids.</i>
###700 Katarina: Don't give him the gun Thomas!
###702 Officer Villarreal: I'll shoot her!
###702 Put your gun down!
###703 Katarina: No, get away!
###709 <i> Narrator: Fearing a  dirty bomb attack in</i>
###711 <i> his home city of  Houston, Texas,</i>
###713 <i> Tom Perez has  built himself a</i>
###714 <i> 700-acre compound  300 miles away</i>
###718 <i> called "the Alamo."</i>
###723 <i> He routinely drills his  family's defensive skills,</i>
###725 <i> and today he's having  off-duty officers from the</i>
###728 <i> local sheriff's department  attack the compound.</i>
###732 <i> But his wife and three  kids don't know it yet.</i>
###738 Tom: Grandpa's here, Grandpa's here.
###741 <i> Narrator: Tom's trained  his family to quickly</i>
###742 <i> respond to specific  code phrases,</i>
###745 <i> each of which indicates  a particular threat.</i>
###747 Monica: "Grandpa's here" means get ready.
###749 There's an intruder, get armed.
###754 <i> Narrator: In the  "grandpa's here"</i>
###755 <i> counter attack strategy;</i>
###756 <i> Tom's given each family  member a designated post.</i>
###760 <i> Monica patrols the east  side of the property,</i>
###762 <i> while the children take  a defensive position</i>
###764 <i> closer to the home,  armed with AR-15's.</i>
###770 Officer Spence: We need water please.
###772 Please help my friend.
###773 He's over here.
###774 Officer Spence: Please, please.
###775 Monica: Get down.
###776 <i> Narrator: Tom thinks  that bands of marauders</i>
###777 <i> will stop at nothing  to gain access to the</i>
###779 <i> Alamo and its  supplies.</i>
###780 Monica: Get down, get down.
###781 Officer Spence: Please help.
###783 Please, I'm not armed.
###784 Monica: Get down.
###785 <i> Narrator: Today, he  wants to see how</i>
###786 <i> his two youngest  would react if their</i>
###788 <i> father, mother, and  older sister have</i>
###794 <i> men holding guns  to their heads.</i>
###796 Officer Villarreal: Put y'alls guns down.
###797 Put the gun down, I'll shoot her.
###799 Katarina: Thomas, don't give him the gun!
###801 Officer Villarreal: I'll shoot her!
###802 Katarina: Don't give him the gun!
###803 Officer Villarreal: I'll shoot her!
###804 Katarina: Matthew, no!
###805 Get away!
###806 Officer Villarreal: Put your gun down.
###807 Put your hands behind your head.
###807 Sheriff Pena: Ok, everyone quit.
###810 We're done, c'mon in.
###814 Katarina: It's scary to see my mom getting
###816 held up by one of the gunman and seeing
###820 my two little brothers just surrendering.
###822 Thomas: Me and my little brother we were
###824 kind of not sure what to do.
###827 Officer Gutierrez: Criticize right
###828 off the bat;
###829 everybody comes out of the house.
###830 Everybody should be in the house.
###832 For your protection.
###833 <i> Narrator: Officer  Gutierrez believes coming</i>
###835 <i> outside the safety of  the house makes each of</i>
###837 <i> them more vulnerable  to assault.</i>
###839 Officer Gutierrez: Carlos came up behind
###840 the house, picked your daughter off.
###843 Officer Spence: I was getting close.
###844 It's okay to be aggressive.
###845 Don't be afraid to, to be aggressive.
###848 You know you were going away from the
###849 threat instead of coming to it.
###851 Tom: I like that recommendation of being
###854 aggressive and you know get in there
###856 and putting them down.
###857 Katarina: I think my family needs more time
###859 and more planning on strategies because
###862 like a situation today, you know,
###864 everything just fell apart.
###866 Tom: I will tell you one thing,
###867 I will heed to those criticisms,
###870 and I will implement what's necessary.
###872 Thank you so much for your time.
###874 This is the Alamo and we will be here to defend it.
###881 <i> Narrator: Tom believes  defending the Alamo's</i>
###883 <i> expansive land and  provisions is a greater</i>
###886 <i> task than his family of  five can take on alone.</i>
###889 <i> So to strengthen their  forces against what</i>
###891 <i> could be millions of  displaced Houstonians,</i>
###894 <i> Tom recruited another  prepping family.</i>
###898 <i> When the time  comes, Victoria,</i>
###901 <i> Gobriela and Steve  Vanasse will unite with</i>
###904 <i> Tom at "the Alamo."</i>
###906 Steve: Prepping is probably in the back
###908 of my mind more than sex.
###911 Tom: Steven, he's rather unusual.
###914 However, he is no different than what I am.
###917 Steve: I'm preparing for a dirty bomb blast
###919 in the city of Houston.
###926 The time of reckoning is just around the corner
###930 and that's why I'm prepping and
###932 that's why the rest of you are prepping.
###937 A dirty bomb is particularly dangerous
###940 because of the readily available nature of any
###943 radionuclide that would be used in a dirty bomb.
###949 Elements such as cesium, strontium;
###954 those radionuclides are available in
###956 medicine in the medical field.
###960 <i> Narrator: Radioactive  substances can be</i>
###962 <i> found in hospitals,  research facilities</i>
###965 <i> and construction  sites.</i>
###967 <i> These materials are  required to be secured</i>
###970 <i> from unauthorized  access,</i>
###971 <i> but Steve fears a  theft could occur.</i>
###974 Steve: It's so easy to manufacture.
###977 The unpredictability of a dirty bomb
###979 is the terrorists' best weapon.
###982 We've been lucky so far.
###984 I don't think our fortune will hold out.
###989 Some might call preparing for
###992 a disaster an obsession.
###994 I am obsessed with my family's safety.
###999 <i> Narrator: A single dirty  bomb could contaminate an</i>
###1001 <i> area thirty times the size  of the initial blast site,</i>
###1005 <i> which could cover up  to twenty city blocks.</i>
###1009 <i> The radiation would not be  detected by human senses,</i>
###1012 <i> and the effects of  exposure can be immediate.</i>
###1015 <i> Steve checks radiation  levels in his home once a</i>
###1017 <i> week using a calibrated  Geiger Mueller probe.</i>
###1021 Victoria: Can you use it on someone else?
###1023 Steve: Sure.
###1024 <i> Narrator: Many preppers  purchase radiation meters,</i>
###1026 <i> but unless one has  been trained in how to</i>
###1028 <i> interpret readings,  like Steve,</i>
###1030 <i> nuclear experts consider</i>
###1031 <i> Geiger counters  worthless.</i>
###1034 Steve: Your counts per minute are
###1035 reading very well, looking very low.
###1037 Gobriela: Good.
###1039 Tom: I have chosen Steven because he
###1041 has expertise in areas that I am weak.
###1047 Steve: I've been certified as a
###1049 radiation specialist.
###1050 The filed I am in, I'm constantly reminded
###1053 of the necessity to prepare and be safe.
###1057 <i> Narrator: Steve  is a radiation</i>
###1058 <i> safety officer for  a company that</i>
###1060 <i> assesses contaminated  sites throughout Texas.</i>
###1063 <i> An area of expertise Tom  values highly in preparing</i>
###1066 <i> for radioactive dispersal  from a dirty bomb.</i>
###1069 Steve: Graham, I have the water sample
###1071 from the bayou.
###1072 Graham: Oh good, excellent thank you.
###1073 Let's just see what we got here.
###1075 <i> Narrator: But radiation  exposure is not Steves main</i>
###1078 <i> concern in prepping for  a dirty bomb explosion.</i>
###1081 Steve: The dirty bomb would be the tipping
###1082 point that pushes mild Houstonians into chaos.
###1090 <i> Narrator: Steve thinks  anarchy following an</i>
###1091 <i> attack could  be more deadly,</i>
###1093 <i> so amassing firearms  is his top priority.</i>
###1097 Steve: I want to be able to defend
###1099 against a large-scale assault,
###1100 should such an assault occur.
###1103 <i> Narrator: In fact, when  Steve became a prepper,</i>
###1105 <i> the first thing he did  was purchase a rifle.</i>
###1107 <i> And his collection  has grown since.</i>
###1110 Steve: I have more than one weapon
###1112 because I consider my family backup
###1115 as well too.
###1116 I wanna train Victoria in the proper
###1119 and responsible use of firearms.
###1121 For goodness sakes, who knows?
###1123 Someday she might have my back.
###1127 Victoria: I don't want to shoot guns.
###1129 Gobriela: I think about Victoria firing a gun.
###1136 It freak me out.
###1137 It's very dangerous.
###1139 I don't like the idea, but she need to do it.
###1142 Victoria: Yes, I really have to learn
###1144 cause I "need" to.
###1153 Where are we going?
###1154 Steve: Victoria, we are going to Shiloh shooting
###1156 range, introduce you to the proper handling of
###1159 firearms and respect for firearms.
###1162 Just want you to be safe.
###1165 We take all these opportunities
###1167 to do things as a family.
###1169 It's our prepping.
###1170 Tracy: Uh, so we're gonna learn to
###1172 shoot some guns today right?
###1173 Victoria: Right.
###1175 Tracy: Have you every shot before?
###1176 Steve: Yes.
###1177 Tracy: And have you?
###1178 Victoria: No.
###1179 Tracy: And uh what caliber are
###1180 you experienced with?
###1181 Steve: 40 cal, I have a 40 caliber I'm carrying now.
###1183 Tracy: All right well let's head back to the range.
###1184 Steve: Thanks.
###1187 <i> Narrator: The 40 caliber  pistol is considered</i>
###1189 <i> one of the most  effective hand guns in</i>
###1192 <i> stopping a threat  with a single shot.</i>
###1195 <i> And is used by many  law enforcement</i>
###1197 <i> agencies across  the country.</i>
###1201 <i> But Victoria will be  learning how to use a</i>
###1203 <i> .22, which is  considered a top choice</i>
###1206 <i> for beginners, because  there is less recoil.</i>
###1209 Tracy: Rack it back and just let it go.
###1211 That will load the gun.
###1212 Alright so we're gonna push out,
###1213 slowly gonna work your finger back on
###1215 the trigger nice and easy,
###1217 and the gun goes off
###1218 and you make your shot.
###1219 Okay?
###1220 That's gonna be about how loud it is.
###1222 Alright, you ready to give it a try?
###1225 Victoria: No, but yes.
###1226 Tracy: There you go, lovely.
###1231 Stuff that in there, good.
###1233 It's ok.
###1234 You see that front sight right there?
###1236 You see that dot?
###1237 Now try and keep that front sight on the x as
###1238 you bring that trigger back nice and
###1240 smooth and slow for me okay?
###1243 Great job, very nice;
###1246 that was a good shot.
###1247 Victoria: Really?
###1248 Tracy: Yeah, look, very good job.
###1252 How'd that feel?
###1253 Victoria: Weird.
###1254 Tracy: Weird.
###1255 A little bit exciting?
###1256 A little bit nervous?
###1257 Victoria: Yea a little bit exciting.
###1258 Tracy: Yeah, you want to try another round?
###1260 Ok, let it go.
###1262 Okay slowly work it back.
###1264 Good job!
###1265 Right next to my shot.
###1266 Very good, you're a natural.
###1272 Dad's so proud.
###1278 Usually the younger girls are a little bit
###1280 more timid and scared but she dived right in
###1282 and did her thing, she did a really good job.
###1285 Victoria: I was scared because I was
###1286 scared of hurting someone.
###1288 Steven: I feel so proud right now.
###1291 Victoria: I don't think I will shoot again.
###1293 Steven: And I feel like I'm better prepared now,
###1296 because I can count on Victoria.
###1301 <i> Narrator: While Steve  is just starting to</i>
###1303 <i> train his daughter how  to protect herself,</i>
###1305 <i> his prepping  partner, Tom Perez,</i>
###1307 <i> has been conditioning his  children since birth.</i>
###1310 <i> But, he thinks there are  still some skills they</i>
###1313 <i> need to master, in order  to prove to him they</i>
###1316 <i> have what it takes to  survive at the Alamo.</i>
###1319 Tom: Ok give me your hand.
###1320 You ready?
###1321 Tommy: Yeah.
###1322 Tom: Hold it tight, real hard.
###1328 <i> Narrator: For  the last 4 years,</i>
###1330 <i> Tom Perez has been  collaborating</i>
###1331 <i> with his prepping  prepper, Steve Vanasse.</i>
###1334 <i> Together they've created  a plan to escape a dirty</i>
###1337 <i> bomb attack in Houston,  and unite at Tom's</i>
###1340 <i> 700-acre ranch in  Brackettville Texas,</i>
###1343 <i> which is equipped  with two homes,</i>
###1345 <i> stored food stuffs,  and unlimited water.</i>
###1349 <i> But Tom believes their  stocked supplies will</i>
###1351 <i> eventually run out,  and they will have to</i>
###1353 <i> live off their land's  natural resources.</i>
###1362 Tom: Here at the compound we use various
###1363 methods to capture animals by using
###1367 snares and traps.
###1370 <i> Narrator: Tom uses  restraining traps,</i>
###1372 <i> which are designed  to keep an animal</i>
###1373 <i> alive until the  hunter returns.</i>
###1376 Tom: By knowing how to trap various critters
###1379 provides the nourishment that we will need
###1382 to help us through those hard times.
###1384 <i> Narrator: Today he  wants his sons to finish</i>
###1387 <i> the job he started.</i>
###1395 Tom: Today's the big day.
###1396 You ready?
###1397 Tommy: Ya.
###1399 Tom: You looking forward to it?
###1402 Tommy: Kind of.
###1403 <i> Narrator: Tom is teaching  12-year-old Tommy and</i>
###1405 <i> 6- year-old Matthew,  how to kill a goat.</i>
###1408 <i> A prepping rite of passage  in the Perez family.</i>
###1411 Tom: If I'm not around during doomsday or
###1413 terrorist attack,
###1414 hopefully I will be here,
###1416 but if I am not that's why you are here today.
###1418 And you are going to learn today too.
###1422 Today we are going to use your knife.
###1424 Did you sharpen it today?
###1425 Matthew: What's a terrorist attack?
###1428 Tom: You know when they blew up.
###1432 They, they just do a lot of bad stuff so.
###1436 So this is the backup right here, ok?
###1438 <i> Narrator: Tom is teaching  his sons how to kill a</i>
###1440 <i> goat with a knife,  rather than a gun,</i>
###1443 <i> because he believes that  ammunition will be in</i>
###1445 <i> finite supply after  a dirty bomb attack,</i>
###1448 <i> and knowing how to  use other weapons</i>
###1450 <i> will be essential.</i>
###1451 Tom: Ok whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
###1454 Tommy and Matthew: Whoa, it's a goat.
###1458 Tom: Well, I'll tell you what, Thomas,
###1459 Uh I'm to climb in there and
###1462 then hand me my bag.
###1463 Okay?
###1464 If something happens get your knife out.
###1485 Hold him down.
###1486 Hold him with your fist like that.
###1488 Alright now get up.
###1492 It's a quick, painless death.
###1495 And you want to be swift about it
###1497 because this animal will provide
###1500 food for many days.
###1502 Okay?
###1503 Tommy: Uh-huh.
###1504 Tom: And we have respect for animals.
###1506 Alright give me your hand.
###1509 You ready?
###1510 Tommy: Yeah.
###1511 Tom: Hold it tight, real hard.
###1512 Come right here.
###1515 Ok, ready?
###1518 Hold him down, hold him down.
###1528 You did very good, you did very good.
###1536 Matthew: Ugh.
###1537 Tom: Matthew come over here.
###1539 I want you to come over here this way
###1540 and face us this way.
###1544 Why did we kill this goat today?
###1546 Matthew: For extra back up plan.
###1549 Tom: Good back up plan, way to go.
###1551 He's gone to a better place now.
###1554 Do you like it out here?
###1556 Is it safer for us?
###1559 We'll be moving here soon, okay?
###1561 Permanently.
###1562 Alright, Thomas here, this was your first goat.
###1567 <i> Narrator: As a symbol  of completing their</i>
###1569 <i> rite of passage,  Tommy and Matthew</i>
###1571 <i> will wear the blood  of their first kill.</i>
###1574 Tom: Was this your first goat?
###1575 Matthew: Yes.
###1576 Tom: Okay let me put a little bit here.
###1579 And this shows your manhood.
###1581 Now you guys someday will do
###1583 this with your children, ok?
###1585 I am very proud of you, very proud of you.
###1590 1,2,3.
###1593 Tommy: The killing the goat part was really,
###1596 really challenging part for me.
###1598 I felt sad for it, in a way.
###1600 Matthew: I felt sad for the animal;
###1604 like you feel sad when you kill a goat
###1606 or something.
###1607 To cut it's neck off.
###1609 Tom: 2, 3.
###1612 All right there?
###1614 Okay there we go.
###1624 Narrator: Tom is training himself,
###1625 and his kids to survive a
###1627 world without stored goods.
###1630 But their hunted game is not just for them.
###1633 In following their plan for doomsday,
###1635 the Perez and Vanasse families
###1637 will soon combine forces.
###1639 But Tom has decided to make a change in
###1642 Steve's regular arrival routine.
###1644 Tom: Get on your knees.
###1645 Steve: This is not the plan.
###1646 Tom: What plan?
###1653 <i> Narrator: Steve  Vanasse and Tom Perez</i>
###1655 <i> have been prepping  together to survive a</i>
###1657 <i> dirty bomb attack in  the city of Houston.</i>
###1660 <i> They plan to team  up at Tom's ranch,</i>
###1663 <i> 300 miles away in  Brackettville, Texas</i>
###1666 <i> where they will live  off their preps</i>
###1667 <i> and protect  what's theirs.</i>
###1670 <i> But their first step  towards survival is</i>
###1672 <i> getting out.</i>
###1674 Steve: I don't plan to know what Houston
###1676 will look like a week or a month after
###1679 a dirty bomb descends on Houston.
###1681 I'm leaving;
###1683 I'm heading to the ranch.
###1685 <i> Narrator: Steve believes  downtown Houston</i>
###1687 <i> will be ground zero in  a dirty bomb attack.</i>
###1690 <i> Because it is just four  miles from where his</i>
###1692 <i> family lives, he  thinks they could be</i>
###1694 <i> at risk for  radiation exposure.</i>
###1697 <i> So he puts Gobriela  and Victoria</i>
###1699 <i> to the ultimate  test, bugging out.</i>
###1704 <i> But before they can  leave their house,</i>
###1706 <i> Steve thinks they must  be protected from</i>
###1708 <i> the bomb's  radioactive debris.</i>
###1711 <i> Steve, Gobriela,  and Victoria</i>
###1713 <i> are wearing  Tyvek suits.</i>
###1714 Steve: Put your hood on first.
###1716 <i> Narrator: Which protect  against hazardous</i>
###1718 <i> materials as small  as one micron and</i>
###1720 <i> make certain  radioactive particles</i>
###1722 <i> unable to penetrate  their skin.</i>
###1725 Steve: Can you grab the two bags?
###1726 I'll grab weapons.
###1734 Steve: Let me run you off some strips.
###1736 Gobriela: Okay.
###1737 Steve: Get the big vents up at the top too.
###1740 <i> Narrator: Steve is  taping the vents</i>
###1741 <i> inside their car  because he's worried</i>
###1743 <i> about radioactive  dust from outside,</i>
###1745 <i> being pulled  into the vehicle.</i>
###1748 <i> In addition, they have  self-contained-breathing</i>
###1750 <i> apparatuses secured,  because inhaling bomb</i>
###1753 <i> particles,  could be fatal,</i>
###1755 <i> both immediately  and long-term.</i>
###1758 <i> Even though Houston  temperatures can reach</i>
###1760 <i> over 100 degrees,  they will not run the</i>
###1762 <i> air conditioner  during their bug out.</i>
###1765 Victoria: Turn on the air conditioner.
###1767 Steve: Unfortunately I can't right now.
###1769 Victoria: Ayyye.
###1770 Steve: I know.
###1774 Great dry run everyone.
###1776 Victoria: Are we there yet?
###1777 Steve: We're trying to move as far as
###1779 we can from an anticipated blast zone.
###1784 <i> Narrator: The distance  radioactive material could</i>
###1786 <i> travel in a dirty  bomb attack is</i>
###1788 <i> dependent on wind and  weather patterns.</i>
###1791 Steve: Once we're outside any anticipated
###1793 blast radius, we can pull over,
###1796 take some readings.
###1798 If those readings look good, we can relax.
###1801 <i> Narrator: So  when bugging out,</i>
###1803 <i> Steve plans to stop  at various points to</i>
###1805 <i> determine if they've  outrun the radiation.</i>
###1808 Steve: Victoria, could you put
###1809 out your hands please?
###1815 <i> Narrator: But if Steve  determines they are</i>
###1816 <i> unsafe, they will  have to keep driving.</i>
###1819 Steven: Let me check your feet.
###1822 Readings are all clear.
###1824 I think that we're all clear here.
###1826 We'll be able to take off our
###1828 personal protective equipment.
###1829 Gobriela: Our bug out today was wonderful,
###1833 quick and positive.
###1836 Victoria: No.
###1837 I didn't because it was too hot in the suit.
###1840 Steve: My family really came together on this.
###1843 From here, we're on to our bug out location.
###1852 <i> Narrator: Bugging  out to "the Alamo"</i>
###1854 <i> is central to  Steve's plan.</i>
###1856 <i> But even after prepping  together for four years,</i>
###1859 <i> Tom views Steve  as his protégé.</i>
###1862 Tom: Steve has become an integral part
###1864 of our prepping.
###1865 However, I try to give him advice,
###1867 but in my opinion,
###1869 I would say I'm a better prepper.
###1875 <i> Narrator:  Experience aside,</i>
###1876 <i> Tom thinks that  trust is what will</i>
###1878 <i> hold their survival  team together.</i>
###1885 <i> So today, for  the first time,</i>
###1887 <i> he is testing Steve's  commitment to their plan.</i>
###1890 Steve: Hallelujah.
###1891 That is the best site I could imagine.
###1896 <i> Narrator: Tom has  trained his kids to</i>
###1898 <i> challenge the Vanasses  when they arrive,</i>
###1900 <i> to make sure they  do not bring</i>
###1901 <i> anyone but  themselves;</i>
###1903 <i> because Tom  perceives additional</i>
###1905 <i> people as a threat  to their survival.</i>
###1908 Tom: Boy, let me see your hands.
###1911 I'm not gonna let anyone come on this property,
###1913 because each person takes
###1915 away months of supplies.
###1917 Who are you?
###1920 Slowly.
###1921 Steve: Be cool, be cool.
###1923 Tom: Get on your knees.
###1927 Steve: This is not the plan.
###1928 This is not the plan!
###1929 Katarina: What about the girls?
###1930 Do they have weapons?
###1931 Steve: They're both unarmed.
###1933 We drove all the way from Houston,
###1935 let us the hell in.
###1943 Katarina: Dad, its Steven!
###1945 They're friendlies.
###1946 Tom: Damn!
###1948 Steve: You scared the hell out of me.
###1951 That's some serious operational security Katarina.
###1955 Tom: Come on in.
###1956 Alright.
###1957 Steve: That was alarming.
###1960 I had every course of adrenaline
###1962 just pushing through me.
###1964 He did exactly what he should have done.
###1970 <i> Narrator: Tom and  Steve will test their</i>
###1972 <i> most destructive  defense tactic yet.</i>
###1976 <i> And discover its  power is even more</i>
###1978 <i> dangerous than  they imagined.</i>
###1980 Producer: We have an ambulance on the way.
###1988 <i> Narrator: Houston  prepper, Steve Vanasse,</i>
###1990 <i> has trained his wife,  and their 11 year old</i>
###1992 <i> daughter, to escape  the city after a</i>
###1994 <i> dirty bomb attack, and  drive 300 miles away</i>
###1997 <i> from the explosion's  radioactive dispersal.</i>
###2000 Victoria: Are we there yet?
###2002 <i> Narrator: Their  final destination is</i>
###2004 <i> Brackettville, Texas,  where they plan to</i>
###2006 <i> live on a  700-acre compound</i>
###2008 <i> with Steve's  prepping partner,</i>
###2009 <i> Tom Perez and  his family of 5;</i>
###2012 <i> because Tom and Steve  believe strength,</i>
###2014 <i> is in numbers.</i>
###2017 Steve: I really need to thank Tom Perez
###2019 and his family for including our family
###2022 in their bug out plan.
###2024 Based on the plans we've made,
###2026 our families can form the basis of a
###2028 whole new society and maybe a better society.
###2035 <i> Narrator: Tom and  Steve believe their</i>
###2037 <i> post-apocalyptic  society will be built</i>
###2040 <i> on teamwork.</i>
###2043 Steve: Katarina and Victoria have
###2045 been working on some basil,
###2046 and some garlic and some oregano.
###2050 And so it is just a combination on
###2052 the herbs the girls have cultivated.
###2055 <i> Narrator: When Tom and  Steve's family convene on</i>
###2057 <i> the ranch they live off  what they have prepped.</i>
###2060 <i> Tonight's dinner,  is an 80 pound goat,</i>
###2063 <i> which can yield 40  pounds of meat and</i>
###2065 <i> provide them with more  than 200 servings.</i>
###2068 Steve: The brains inside?
###2069 Tom: Oh yeah.
###2071 Steve: Yum.
###2072 Tom: Would you suck the eyeballs out?
###2074 Steve: I would eat every bit of it,
###2075 every bit of the goat.
###2076 Tom: I forgot to tell you this
###2078 was Thomas' first kill.
###2080 Steve: You got to be proud man, that's awesome.
###2085 <i> Narrator: But the  main focus of Steve's</i>
###2086 <i> visit is to  assess and improve</i>
###2088 <i> their security maneuvers.</i>
###2093 <i> It could take more  than one hour to patrol</i>
###2095 <i> the perimeter of the  700 acre ranch on foot.</i>
###2098 <i> And even with 8  preppers on site,</i>
###2100 <i> not every inch of land  can be guarded at all times.</i>
###2104 Tom: We always try to seek other methods to improve
###2107 and refine the areas of weakness.
###2110 <i> Narrator: So today, they  are testing their most</i>
###2111 <i> deadly defense plan  to date, IED's.</i>
###2115 Steve: This would be a great place
###2116 to practice IED placement.
###2119 Tom: Okay.
###2120 Steve: See how effective these would
###2121 be under real life circumstances?
###2125 <i> Narrator: IED's  are homemade bombs</i>
###2127 <i> and they are the  most frequently</i>
###2129 <i> used terrorist  weapons.</i>
###2130 Tom: The ball bearings and all the nails
###2133 and stuff, we'll get at least 30 yards.
###2135 <i> Narrator: Tom and  Steve plan to hide</i>
###2137 <i> them every  30 yards.</i>
###2139 <i> This strategic placement  creates what is known</i>
###2142 <i> as a kill-zone: a  regularly used</i>
###2144 <i> ambush tactic  in the military.</i>
###2146 <i> The high concentration  of explosives,</i>
###2148 <i> combined with  coordinated gun fire,</i>
###2150 <i> ensures a target is  not just injured,</i>
###2152 <i> but destroyed.</i>
###2157 Tom: You know the rule.
###2158 Trespassers will be shot,
###2160 survivors will be shot again.
###2165 <i> Narrator: Tom and Steve  will detonate an IED</i>
###2167 <i> from inside a hunting  blind, 20 feet high,</i>
###2171 <i> which eliminates  face-to-face threats and</i>
###2173 <i> provides a panoptic view  of the Alamo's land.</i>
###2177 <i> This allows them to detect  enemies from miles away</i>
###2180 <i> and direct their fire  towards the kill zone.</i>
###2182 Steve: Sighted in.
###2184 Tom: 3, 2, 1.
###2195 Get back, Steve.
###2197 One thing I find irritating about
###2199 Steven is safety.
###2201 Steven has not grown up with weapons like I did.
###2205 Steve: I am a big believer in
###2207 large capacity magazines.
###2210 My attitude is, the bigger the better.
###2212 <i> Narrator: Steve's rifle  has a 100 round capacity</i>
###2215 <i> magazine, which is  recommended for ambush</i>
###2217 <i> situations because  it can sustain a</i>
###2219 <i> high volume of fire.</i>
###2221 <i> Because the firing  power is so great,</i>
###2223 <i> it is outfitted  with a muzzle brake,</i>
###2225 <i> to reduce recoil and  increase accuracy.</i>
###2230 Steve: Target acquired Tom.
###2233 Fire, in the hole.
###2239 Medic: No you're not bleeding and
###2240 you don't have any discharge.
###2241 Does it hurt at all?
###2243 Tom: I can't hear you.
###2245 God damn it Steve.
###2251 Medic: Sit down, come on.
###2260 Tom: I don't want to stand things are spinning.
###2262 Medic: Do you feel better now
###2263 that you're laying down?
###2265 Tom: Things are spinning.
###2266 <i> Narrator: Muzzle  brakes reduce recoil,</i>
###2267 <i> but they can increase  sound volume to</i>
###2269 <i> more than 140 decibels  and cause serious injury.</i>
###2273 <i> When Steve fired his  shot from inside</i>
###2275 <i> the hunting blind.</i>
###2277 <i> The high volume noise  inside the confined</i>
###2279 <i> space might have caused  Tom to lose his hearing,</i>
###2282 <i> even with his ear  protection on.</i>
###2284 Medic: Can you hear me at all?
###2286 I need you to answer my question.
###2287 We're going to get your blood pressure,
###2289 let you lay down, cool off,
###2291 calm down a little bit.
###2292 Steve: I saw the shell eject toward
###2293 the windows.
###2294 It wasn't near his face or anything.
###2296 I'm not coming up with excuses or
###2298 explanations or anything.
###2299 I don't know what happened.
###2301 Medic: Your blood pressure's a
###2302 little bit high.
###2306 Producer: We have an ambulance on the way.
###2308 <i> Narrator: After four  years of planning for a</i>
###2310 <i> dirty bomb  attack together,</i>
###2312 <i> Steve's mistake  might be the end</i>
###2314 <i> of their prepping  partnership.</i>
###2316 Tom: Man, you (bleep) up man.
###2319 I can't hear.
###2321 This is (bleep).
###2328 <i> Narrator: Tom Perez  and Steve Vanasse are</i>
###2330 <i> prepping to protect  their families from a</i>
###2332 <i> dirty bomb attack in  Houston and assemble</i>
###2335 <i> at Tom's ranch  300 miles away.</i>
###2338 <i> They have combined  their families,</i>
###2340 <i> Steve's radiation  knowledge,</i>
###2341 <i> and Tom's weapons  experience,</i>
###2343 <i> to create a prepping  partnership that they</i>
###2345 <i> believe will increase  their chances of</i>
###2347 <i> protecting the  ranch's 700 acres.</i>
###2350 <i> But after testing their  most deadly security</i>
###2352 <i> weapon to date, Tom  may have sustained a</i>
###2355 <i> serious injury and</i>
###2356 <i> severed his ties  with Steve.</i>
###2364 Medic: We checked him out, his vitals were a little
###2366 bit elevated just from the adrenaline,
###2369 the shock, the fear, but, he was fine.
###2379 Tom: Man, you (bleep) up man.
###2381 You fired inside the freaking blind dude.
###2385 I have to let you go, dude.
###2387 I'm serious.
###2391 I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to let you go.
###2397 I'm sorry;
###2398 I just don't know what else to tell you.
###2399 Steve: No matter what happens, man,
###2400 I'm still here for you.
###2402 I am.
###2404 I'm heartbroken.
###2408 He's in pain.
###2420 <i> Narrator: But  after realizing he</i>
###2421 <i> did not suffer any  permanent damage,</i>
###2424 <i> Tom reassessed  whether or not,</i>
###2425 <i> to end his four-year  partnership with Steve.</i>
###2430 Tom: We're gonna have to work on a lot of rules.
###2433 Safety needs to be put first.
###2436 I mean, I'm just worried that's all man.
###2439 Ya know?
###2440 It's cool, I trust you man.
###2442 But, we're just gonna have
###2443 to work on safety man.
###2446 Okay?
###2446 Steve: Your ranch, your rules.
###2448 I respect that.
###2449 Tom: Alright, right, ok man;
###2451 we can eat and just move on.
###2457 Now notice the legs are much
###2459 more well done than the ribs?
###2461 Steve: Being prepared is not a straight line.
###2466 Tom: This is in my opinion,
###2468 the best survival team that could come together.
###2472 Steve: I certainly have room for improvement.
###2475 Alright, let's eat, feast!
###2477 And I recognize that.
###2494 Katarina: Just swallow it, just swallow it.
###2507 <i> Narrator: Tom and  Steve, the experts,</i>
###2508 <i> Practical Preppers  have reviewed and</i>
###2510 <i> assessed your plan  to survive a</i>
###2512 <i> dirty bomb attack.</i>
###2514 <i> Steve, your chance at  surviving a major disaster</i>
###2517 <i> depends on your  successful ability to</i>
###2519 <i> bug out to  Tom's ranch.</i>
###2521 Steve: Yes.
###2523 <i> Narrator: Tom, your  water preps are highly</i>
###2524 <i> impressive because you own  the water rights beneath</i>
###2527 <i> your property, and your  food re-supply plan is</i>
###2529 <i> enough to sustain  both families.</i>
###2532 <i> However, the 300-mile  trip to your compound</i>
###2535 <i> could be difficult  if a flood of</i>
###2537 <i> people is also  leaving Houston.</i>
###2539 <i> You may have to  travel by foot.</i>
###2541 <i> The experts recommend you  store hidden caches of</i>
###2543 <i> supplies along  your bug out route.</i>
###2545 Tom: I haven't gone all in just yet,
###2548 so I'm holding back on a few cards.
###2552 <i> Narrator: To determine how  long you could initially</i>
###2554 <i> survive a catastrophe,  Practical Preppers has</i>
###2556 <i> scored your preps in five  categories of 20 points</i>
###2560 <i> each, for a total  possible score of 100.</i>
###2564 <i> Water: 20 out  of 20 points.</i>
###2568 <i> Food: because  Steve isn't</i>
###2570 <i> bringing his  own supplies,</i>
###2571 <i> there will be  fewer resources.</i>
###2573 <i> 10 out of  20 points.</i>
###2576 <i> Shelter: you should  build a bunker under</i>
###2578 <i> the Alamo, in case you  come under attack.</i>
###2581 <i> 16 out of 20 points.</i>
###2583 <i> Security: take a  combat related class</i>
###2586 <i> to improve your  existing strategies.</i>
###2589 <i> 15 out of 20 points.</i>
###2592 <i> Joining forces  helps give you</i>
###2593 <i> 16 out of 20  x-factor points.</i>
###2596 <i> Your total survival  score is 77;</i>
###2599 <i> this gives you 15  months initial</i>
###2601 <i> survival time  together.</i>
###2603 Tom: I agree with a majority of the
###2605 assessments, however as a prepper,
###2608 I don't disclose all my resources.
###2611 I hope others will learn and
###2612 I am learning from others that are preppers.
###2617 Steve: Prepper brother and sisters and
###2619 welcome back National Geographic.
###2621 National Geographic's experts brutally
###2623 nailed me on their assessment.
###2626 Victoria's been training in high caliber weapons,
###2629 archery, and she's deadly accurate.
###2633 And she's also trained in defensive driving
###2637 maneuvers and she loves to drive and does it well.
###2640 Gobriela and I took fencing classes and
###2645 we're also studying for our HAM radio license.
###2651 Tom: Hello, this is Tom uh reporting
###2652 back on a follow-up.
###2654 Just thought I'd let you all know,
###2655 we've decided to home school our kids.
###2657 If something were to happen,
###2658 we continue to educate our child.
###2661 We have a well-written curriculum here at
###2663 "Doomsday Academy," something handy just
###2666 for a little fire drill.
###2668 And I'm also trying to procure a uh armor car
###2672 vehicle used, and uh that will be our
###2675 new bug-out vehicle.
###2676 And also we're working on our bunker now,
###2679 uh on undisclosed areas.
###2681 Here at Doomsday Academy, signing off.
###2684 God bless our troops, God bless America.
