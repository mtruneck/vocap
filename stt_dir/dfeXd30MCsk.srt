1
0:0:2,19 --> 0:0:4,94
GOOD MORNING. AT THE END OF TODAY'S LECTURE
I


2
0:0:4,94 --> 0:0:7,16
WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MIDTERM AND
IF YOU


3
0:0:7,16 --> 0:0:10,459
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I WANT TO REMIND YOU AGAIN
THE


4
0:0:10,459 --> 0:0:13,52
REVIEW SESSION IS GOING TO BE ON TUESDAY NIGHT
AT 6:00


5
0:0:13,52 --> 0:0:18,26
O'CLOCK IN 145 DWINELLE. AND, IT WILL NOT
BE WEBCAST.


6
0:0:18,26 --> 0:0:22,9
SO, THAT IF YOU WISH TO COME YOU WILL HAVE
TO COME


7
0:0:22,9 --> 0:0:23,93
BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PICK IT UP ON
THE


8
0:0:23,93 --> 0:0:26,37
WEBCAST. THE OTHER THING IS, THAT IT IS A
WORKING


9
0:0:26,37 --> 0:0:29,86
SESSION. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING PREPARED AND
I WILL


10
0:0:29,86 --> 0:0:31,98
TAKE WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU ASK AND WE WILL
TRY TO


11
0:0:31,98 --> 0:0:36,19
ANSWER THEM. SO, MAKE GOOD USE OF THE TIME.
AT THE


12
0:0:36,19 --> 0:0:38,46
END OF THE LECTURE TODAY AS I MENTIONED I
WILL TALK


13
0:0:38,46 --> 0:0:41,89
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE MIDTERM AND I
WILL HAVE


14
0:0:41,89 --> 0:0:44,909
OFFICE HOURS NEXT WEEK ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY
AS


15
0:0:44,909 --> 0:0:50,179
USUAL. AND I WILL BE GLAD TO MEET WITH YOU.


16
0:0:50,179 --> 0:0:52,399
LAST TIME I INTRODUCED YOU TO SOME OF THE


17
0:0:52,399 --> 0:0:56,28
CONCEPTS THAT WERE, THAT WATER MOVEMENT AND
WATER


18
0:0:56,28 --> 0:1:0,299
RELATIONS REVOLVE AROUND. AND WE SAID THAT
THE


19
0:1:0,299 --> 0:1:3,269
 MOVEMENT OF WATER IN PLANTS AND INDEED IN
ALL LIVING


20
0:1:3,269 --> 0:1:10,8
SYSTEMS, IS DETERMINED BY THE WATER POTENTIAL.
AND,


21
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:12,73
WE SAID THAT THE WATER POTENTIAL WAS A ABBREVIATED
BY


22
0:1:12,73 --> 0:1:16,54
THE GREEK LETTER PSI. AND THAT THE WATER POTENTIAL


23
0:1:16,54 --> 0:1:21,73
FOR OUR PURPOSES OF PURE WATER, WE SAID WAS
EQUAL TO


24
0:1:21,73 --> 0:1:26,6
ZERO. PSI EQUALS ZERO FOR PURE WATER. WE ALSO
SAID


25
0:1:26,6 --> 0:1:30,18
THAT WATER POTENTIAL HAS SEVERAL COMPONENTS
WHICH MAKE


26
0:1:30,18 --> 0:1:34,3
IT UP. SO THEN WE SAID THAT PSI EQUALS PSI'S
OF PI


27
0:1:34,3 --> 0:1:37,98
PLUS PSI'S OF P. THESE TWO COMPONENTS WHICH
MAKE UP


28
0:1:37,98 --> 0:1:40,72
THE WATER POTENTIAL WHICH DETERMINE WHICH
WAY THE


29
0:1:40,72 --> 0:1:45,57
WATER MOVES. LAST TIME WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT
THIS WE


30
0:1:45,57 --> 0:1:54,25
ALSO MENTIONED TO YOU THAT THE DRIVING FORCE
FOR WATER


31
0:1:54,25 --> 0:2:1,0
MOVEMENT AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT
POINT


32
0:2:1,0 --> 0:2:9,259
FROM LAST LECTURE, IN PLANTS IS THE EVAPORATION
OF


33
0:2:9,259 --> 0:2:23,3
WATER, WHICH WE SAID WAS EQUAL TO TRANSPIRATION.


34
0:2:23,3 --> 0:2:25,53
ESSENTIALLY IF YOU REMEMBER OF COLUMN OF WATER
THAT I


35
0:2:25,53 --> 0:2:29,18
ILLUSTRATED TO YOU LAST TIME WITH THE RUBBER
BAND


36
0:2:29,18 --> 0:2:31,78
BEING THE HYDROGEN BONDS AND THE YELLOW BEING
THE


37
0:2:31,78 --> 0:2:34,67
 WATER MOLECULES, ESSENTIALLY THE WATER COLUMN
IS


38
0:2:34,67 --> 0:2:39,819
STRETCHED DUE TO TRANSPIRATION AND WATER IS
LITERALLY


39
0:2:39,819 --> 0:2:43,54
PULLED UP THE TREE, PULLED UP THE TREE DUE
TO THIS


40
0:2:43,54 --> 0:2:47,0
STRETCHING. AND THIS IS THE MECHANISM BY WHICH
WATER


41
0:2:47,0 --> 0:2:50,819
IS MOVED UP THE TREE. THIS PULL, WHICH ORIGINATES
AS


42
0:2:50,819 --> 0:2:54,78
A RESULT OF A EVAPORATION AND IS PASSED DOWN
THROUGH


43
0:2:54,78 --> 0:2:58,25
THE HYDROGEN BONDS FROM ONE WATER MOLECULE
TO ANOTHER.


44
0:2:58,25 --> 0:3:2,26
AND WE WILL RETURN TO THIS IDEA IN A MOMENT.
FINALLY,


45
0:3:2,26 --> 0:3:7,25
LAST TIME I ENDED BY TALKING TO YOU ABOUT
A CELL IN


46
0:3:7,25 --> 0:3:12,14
WHICH THE MEMBRANE HAD BEEN PULLED AWAY FROM
THE CELL


47
0:3:12,14 --> 0:3:16,27
DURING WILTING.


48
0:3:16,27 --> 0:3:18,23
AND WE SAID THAT THE MEMBRANE, WHICH IS


49
0:3:18,23 --> 0:3:23,69
INDICATED BY THIS LINE HERE, WAS PULLED AWAY
FROM THE


50
0:3:23,69 --> 0:3:34,6
CELL WHEN WATER IS LOST FROM THE CELL. AT
THIS POINT


51
0:3:34,6 --> 0:3:46,56
WHERE THE MEMBRANE JUST PULLS AWAY


52
0:3:46,56 --> 0:3:47,36
WE SAID THAT PSI'S


53
0:3:47,36 --> 0:3:50,9
OF P EQUALS ZERO.


54
0:3:50,9 --> 0:3:53,349
AND WE GIVE A SPECIAL NAME TO THIS POINT WHERE


55
0:3:53,349 --> 0:3:57,319
PSI'S OF P JUST EQUALS ZERO. WE CALL THIS
INCIPIENT


56
0:3:57,319 --> 0:4:6,93
 PLASMOLYSIS. AND I MENTIONED TO YOU LAST
TIME THAT


57
0:4:6,93 --> 0:4:10,4
THERE IS A YOUTUBE URL WHICH IS POSTED ON
YOUR WEB


58
0:4:10,4 --> 0:4:13,959
PAGE WHICH WILL TAKE YOU TO SOME EXAMPLES
OF INCIPIENT


59
0:4:13,959 --> 0:4:16,599
PLASMOLYSIS OR PLASMOLYSIS IN GENERAL. AND
YOU ARE


60
0:4:16,599 --> 0:4:19,6
ALSO GOING TO BE DOING THIS IN THE LAB THE
WEEK AFTER


61
0:4:19,6 --> 0:4:23,52
NEXT. YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO DO IT YOURSELF.
NOW,


62
0:4:23,52 --> 0:4:27,28
WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY IS TO GIVE YOU SOME
PRACTICE


63
0:4:27,28 --> 0:4:29,93
WITH THE WATER RELATIONS EQUATION THAT WILL
HELP YOU


64
0:4:29,93 --> 0:4:32,96
WITH YOUR EXAMPLES THAT ARE GOING TO BE ON
YOUR


65
0:4:32,96 --> 0:4:37,38
PROBLEM SET. AND I WANT TO BEGIN WITH THE
AN EXAMPLE


66
0:4:37,38 --> 0:4:40,73
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME. WHICH WAS
THE


67
0:4:40,73 --> 0:4:43,85
STOMATA. WANT TO TALK ABOUT THESE. WE SAID
THE


68
0:4:43,85 --> 0:4:47,25
STOMATA WERE THE PORES AND THE GUARD CELLS
THROUGH


69
0:4:47,25 --> 0:4:50,49
WHICH WATER VAPOR ESCAPED AND THROUGH WHICH
CO2 ENTERS


70
0:4:50,49 --> 0:4:53,8
INTO THE PLANT. AND I SAID LAST TIME AND YOU
READ


71
0:4:53,8 --> 0:4:56,669
ABOUT IT IN YOUR BOOK, THAT THE SIZE OF THE
PORE IS


72
0:4:56,669 --> 0:5:0,43
DETERMINED BY HOW MUCH PRESSURE IS INSIDE
OF GUARD


73
0:5:0,43 --> 0:5:2,419
CELLS. THIS SHOULD JUST BE REVIEW FROM LAST
TIME.


74
0:5:2,419 --> 0:5:5,91
 AND NOW WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY
IS, HOW


75
0:5:5,91 --> 0:5:8,74
DOES THIS PRESSURE ARISE IN THE GUARD CELL?
WE SAID


76
0:5:8,74 --> 0:5:11,169
THAT THAT PRESSURE WAS CALLED TURGOR PRESSURE.
WE


77
0:5:11,169 --> 0:5:14,8
WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT ARISES AND HOW IT
IS RELATED


78
0:5:14,8 --> 0:5:19,11
TO WATER. SO, LET'S DRAW A GUARD CELL FOR
US. HERE


79
0:5:19,11 --> 0:5:24,1
IS THE PORE. AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE PORE
ARE THE


80
0:5:24,1 --> 0:5:32,41
TWO GUARD CELLS. TWO GUARD CELLS. AND THEY'RE,
OF


81
0:5:32,41 --> 0:5:35,139
COURSE, ARE PART OF THE EPIDERMIS ON THE LEAF
SO THEY


82
0:5:35,139 --> 0:5:44,419
ARE SURROUNDED BY OTHER EPIDERMAL CELLS. AND
THE ONE


83
0:5:44,419 --> 0:5:46,729
OTHER THING THAT WE HAVE TO ADD TO THIS, WHICH
IS


84
0:5:46,729 --> 0:5:50,93
IMPLIED, IS THAT EACH OF THE CELLS BECAUSE
THEY ARE


85
0:5:50,93 --> 0:6:5,15
ALIVE, HAVE A MEMBRANE. HAVE A MEMBRANE. LET'S
BEGIN


86
0:6:5,15 --> 0:6:9,729
NOW WITH A SERIES OF STEPS THAT WE WOULD FOLLOW
IN THE


87
0:6:9,729 --> 0:6:12,979
OPENING OF THE PORE. SO, WE ARE GOING TO TALK
ABOUT


88
0:6:12,979 --> 0:6:19,93
OPENING OF THE PORE. THE FIRST STEP WHICH
IS GOING TO


89
0:6:19,93 --> 0:6:23,9
HAVE TO HAPPEN IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
TO START


90
0:6:23,9 --> 0:6:27,63
THINKING OF SOME WAY OF BUILDING UP THE PRESSURE


91
0:6:27,63 --> 0:6:31,49
INSIDE OF THE GUARD CELLS TO CAUSE THEM TO
OPEN UP, TO


92
0:6:31,49 --> 0:6:34,93
 BOW OUT. SO, WHAT REALLY HAPPENS FIRST OF
ALL, IS


93
0:6:34,93 --> 0:6:40,65
THAT SOLUTES AND THE PARTICULAR SOLUTE THAT
WE WANT TO


94
0:6:40,65 --> 0:6:49,449
TALK ABOUT IS POTASSIUM, IS MOVED ACTIVELY
FROM THE


95
0:6:49,449 --> 0:6:56,6
EPIDERMAL CELL


96
0:6:56,6 --> 0:6:59,28
INTO THE GUARD CELL. AND I WILL JUST


97
0:6:59,28 --> 0:7:9,889
ABBREVIATE GUARD CELL AS GC. THIS RESULTS
IN A MORE


98
0:7:9,889 --> 0:7:16,86
NEGATIVE PSI'S OF PI IN THE GUARD CELL. MORE
NEGATIVE


99
0:7:16,86 --> 0:7:20,63
PSI'S OF PI IN THE GUARD CELL, WHICH RESULTS
IN


100
0:7:20,63 --> 0:7:29,389
A CHANGE IN THE PSI OF THE GUARD CELL. BECOMES
MORE


101
0:7:29,389 --> 0:7:36,25
NEGATIVE.


102
0:7:36,25 --> 0:7:45,6
AND AT THIS POINT THEN, WATER ENTERS THE


103
0:7:45,6 --> 0:7:54,63
GUARD CELL INCREASING TURGOR PRESSURE AND
THE GUARD


104
0:7:54,63 --> 0:8:3,68
CELL OPENS. THE PORE OPENS.


105
0:8:3,68 --> 0:8:6,819
NOW, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO PUT SOME


106
0:8:6,819 --> 0:8:10,639
NUMBERS TO MAKE A TABLE, TO GIVE YOU SOME
REAL NUMBERS


107
0:8:10,639 --> 0:8:14,12
WITH REGARD TO THE WATER POTENTIAL EQUATION
OF WHAT IS


108
0:8:14,12 --> 0:8:17,27
HAPPENING AS THE POTASSIUM IS MOVING INTO
THE GUARD


109
0:8:17,27 --> 0:8:20,3
CELL. AND, FOR THIS PURPOSE WE ARE GOING TO
MAKE


110
0:8:20,3 --> 0:8:31,71
A TABLE AND THIS TABLE WILL HAVE THREE VALUES.
IT


111
0:8:31,71 --> 0:8:38,729
WILL HAVE PSI, PSI'S OF PI, AND PSI'S OF P.
AND, WE


112
0:8:38,729 --> 0:8:42,63
 ARE NOW GOING TO LOOK AT HOW PSI AND PSI'S
OF PI AND


113
0:8:42,63 --> 0:8:46,74
PSI'S OF P CHANGE IN THE GUARD CELL WHEN IT
IS EITHER


114
0:8:46,74 --> 0:8:50,75
OPEN OR CLOSED. SO, IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE
WE WILL


115
0:8:50,75 --> 0:8:54,39
SAY, THIS IS WHEN IT IS OPEN, AND IN THIS
CASE, WE


116
0:8:54,39 --> 0:8:57,35
WILL SAY THIS IS WHEN THE PORE IS CLOSED.
AND THEN WE


117
0:8:57,35 --> 0:9:1,51
WILL DIVIDE EACH OF THESE TWO SITUATIONS INTO
THE


118
0:9:1,51 --> 0:9:10,459
GUARD CELL AND THE EPIDERMAL CELL. GUARD CELL
AND THE


119
0:9:10,459 --> 0:9:17,88
EPIDERMAL CELL. NOW, IF WE WERE TO START TO
PUT SOME


120
0:9:17,88 --> 0:9:21,62
VALUES ON THESE. AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU
TO HAVE


121
0:9:21,62 --> 0:9:24,57
A SENSE OF FROM TODAY'S LECTURE. BECAUSE,
THIS IS


122
0:9:24,57 --> 0:9:26,63
WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO NEED FOR THE WATER RELATIONS


123
0:9:26,63 --> 0:9:30,14
PROBLEMS. WE HAVE TO BEGIN BY HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING


124
0:9:30,14 --> 0:9:33,14
OF WHAT REALISTIC VALUES ARE WITH REGARD TO
THESE


125
0:9:33,14 --> 0:9:37,31
VARIOUS COMPONENTS. PSI, PSI'S OF PI AND PSI'S
OF P.


126
0:9:37,31 --> 0:9:40,8
SO LET'S LOOK FIRST AT THE SITUATION OF WHEN
THE GUARD


127
0:9:40,8 --> 0:9:42,88
CELL IS CLOSED. WHEN THE PORE IS CLOSED. AT
THAT


128
0:9:42,88 --> 0:9:45,52
PARTICULAR POINT THERE WOULD BE RELATIVELY
LOW


129
0:9:45,52 --> 0:9:49,12
PRESSURE INSIDE OF THE CELLS. LOW PRESSURE.
SO


130
0:9:49,12 --> 0:9:53,19
 A REASONABLE VALUE WOULD BE 1 FOR THE TURGOR
PRESSURE


131
0:9:53,19 --> 0:9:57,49
INSIDE THE GUARD CELL. NOW, HOW ABOUT THE
TURGOR


132
0:9:57,49 --> 0:10:1,6
PRESSURE IN THE ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL. WHAT
WOULD


133
0:10:1,6 --> 0:10:3,459
ITS TURGOR PRESSURE BE? THAT CELL WHICH IS
RIGHT


134
0:10:3,459 --> 0:10:7,29
NEXT TO THE GUARD CELL. WELL, A REASONABLE
VALUE LIKE


135
0:10:7,29 --> 0:10:11,98
BEFORE. THESE ARE 4 BARS OR 4 ATMOSPHERES.
NOW HOW


136
0:10:11,98 --> 0:10:16,97
ABOUT THE SOLUTE POTENTIAL? THE SALTS THAT
ARE


137
0:10:16,97 --> 0:10:21,45
INSIDE THE GUARD CELL. A REASONABLE VALUE
WHEN IT IS


138
0:10:21,45 --> 0:10:26,36
CLOSED MIGHT BE CONCENTRATION 2. AND IN THE
ADJACENT


139
0:10:26,36 --> 0:10:29,74
EPIDERMAL CELL, MAYBE CONCENTRATION 6, BECAUSE
IT HAS


140
0:10:29,74 --> 0:10:33,81
MORE POTASSIUM AT THIS POINT. NOW, LET'S LOOK
AT THE


141
0:10:33,81 --> 0:10:36,56
SITUATION WHEN THE GUARD CELL HAS BEEN OPENED.
THAT


142
0:10:36,56 --> 0:10:40,5
IS, POTASSIUM HAS BEEN ACTIVELY MOVED ACROSS
THE


143
0:10:40,5 --> 0:10:44,8
MEMBRANE FROM THE EPIDERMAL CELL INTO THE
GUARD CELL.


144
0:10:44,8 --> 0:10:48,55
AT THIS POINT WE SAID THE GUARD CELL IS NOW
GOING TO


145
0:10:48,55 --> 0:10:52,5
OPEN THE PORE, SO ITS TURGOR PRESSURE HAS
HAD TO


146
0:10:52,5 --> 0:10:55,54
INCREASE. THIS IS A REASONABLE VALUE FOR THE
TURGOR


147
0:10:55,54 --> 0:10:59,84
PRESSURE. IN THE ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL,
BECAUSE WE


148
0:10:59,84 --> 0:11:2,76
 HAVE LOST SOME WATER, ITS TURGOR PRESSURE
HAS


149
0:11:2,76 --> 0:11:5,1
DECREASED SOMEWHAT, BUT NOT A LOT. THESE ARE


150
0:11:5,1 --> 0:11:9,58
REASONABLE VALUES. AND NOW IF WE LOOK TO SEE
WHAT HAS


151
0:11:9,58 --> 0:11:12,81
HAPPENED WITH REGARD TO PSI'S OF PI. THAT
IS, THE


152
0:11:12,81 --> 0:11:15,79
SOLUTE POTENTIAL. AS A RESULT OF THE POTASSIUM
BEING


153
0:11:15,79 --> 0:11:19,519
MOVED IN, A REASONABLE VALUE MIGHT BE CONCENTRATION
8.


154
0:11:19,519 --> 0:11:21,82
SO WE HAVE GONE FROM CONCENTRATION 2 TO CONCENTRATION


155
0:11:21,82 --> 0:11:26,6
8. WHERE DOES THIS POTASSIUM COME FROM? WELL,
IT


156
0:11:26,6 --> 0:11:30,22
COMES FROM THE ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL. SO,
THE


157
0:11:30,22 --> 0:11:32,649
ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL HAS GIVEN UP SOME
OF ITS


158
0:11:32,649 --> 0:11:39,269
POTASSIUM AND IN THE PROCESS HAS NOW BECOME
A LESS


159
0:11:39,269 --> 0:11:43,56
NEGATIVE WITH REGARD TO ITS SOLUTE POTENTIAL.
NOW, WE


160
0:11:43,56 --> 0:11:47,95
HAVE ALL OF THE COMPONENTS WHICH ALLOW US
TO CALCULATE


161
0:11:47,95 --> 0:11:50,49
THE WATER POTENTIAL. AND TO REMIND YOU OF
THE


162
0:11:50,49 --> 0:11:56,8
EQUATION, PSI EQUALS PSI'S OF PI PLUS PSI'S
OF P. SO,


163
0:11:56,8 --> 0:11:59,87
IF WE NOW CALCULATE THE WATER POTENTIAL FOR
EACH OF


164
0:11:59,87 --> 0:12:4,73
THESE COLUMNS, WE HAVE GOT A 5, AND A NEGATIVE
8. THE


165
0:12:4,73 --> 0:12:7,86
OVERALL PSI OF THE GUARD CELL WHEN IT IS OPEN
WOULD BE


166
0:12:7,86 --> 0:12:12,45
 CONCENTRATION 3. PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.
AT THE TIME


167
0:12:12,45 --> 0:12:14,93
THE GUARD CELL IS OPEN THE OVERALL PSI FOR
THE


168
0:12:14,93 --> 0:12:18,74
ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL WOULD BE 3 AND A NEGATIVE
4,


169
0:12:18,74 --> 0:12:22,769
WOULD BE CONCENTRATION 1. NOW, LET'S LOOK
AT THE


170
0:12:22,769 --> 0:12:26,98
SITUATION WHEN IT IS CLOSED. WHEN IT IS CLOSED
WE


171
0:12:26,98 --> 0:12:31,75
HAVE 1 AND A NEGATIVE 2 GIVE US CONCENTRATION
1. AND


172
0:12:31,75 --> 0:12:37,92
THE ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL WOULD BE CONCENTRATION
2.


173
0:12:37,92 --> 0:12:41,42
NOW, LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE SHOWN HERE.
FIRST OF


174
0:12:41,42 --> 0:12:46,899
ALL, IN THE CLOSED SITUATION THE MORE NEGATIVE
WATER


175
0:12:46,899 --> 0:12:50,86
POTENTIAL IN THE EPIDERMAL CELL KEEPS THE
WATER


176
0:12:50,86 --> 0:12:54,5
WANTING TO BE MOSTLY IN THE ADJACENT EPIDERMAL
CELL.


177
0:12:54,5 --> 0:12:56,769
NOT ON THE GUARD CELL AND HENCE THE TURGOR
PRESSURE IS


178
0:12:56,769 --> 0:13:1,589
LOW. ONCE WE PUMP POTASSIUM FROM THE EPIDERMAL
CELL


179
0:13:1,589 --> 0:13:7,29
INTO THE GUARD CELL AND INCREASE ITS SOLUTE
POTENTIAL


180
0:13:7,29 --> 0:13:11,43
WE NOW CAN AFFECT THE WATER POTENTIAL OF THE
GUARD


181
0:13:11,43 --> 0:13:14,2
CELL WHICH NOW BECOMES MORE NEGATIVE THAN
THE


182
0:13:14,2 --> 0:13:19,48
EPIDERMAL CELL AND WATER NOW FLOWS THIS DIRECTION.


183
0:13:19,48 --> 0:13:23,74
THE MOVEMENT OF WATER THEN CAUSES AN INCREASE
IN THE


184
0:13:23,74 --> 0:13:27,86
 TURGOR PRESSURE. AND THIS BASICALLY IS WHAT
HAPPENS


185
0:13:27,86 --> 0:13:32,72
IN THE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE A OPENING AND
CLOSING


186
0:13:32,72 --> 0:13:36,2
OF A GUARD CELL DUE TO A CHANGE OF TURGOR
PRESSURE.


187
0:13:36,2 --> 0:13:39,32
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT
OF WATER


188
0:13:39,32 --> 0:13:42,49
IS DETERMINED NOT BY THESE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS,
NOT


189
0:13:42,49 --> 0:13:46,99
BY PSI'S OF PI OR PSI'S OF P, BUT BY THE WATER


190
0:13:46,99 --> 0:13:49,18
POTENTIAL. THE NUMBER THAT YOU GET BY ADDING
THE


191
0:13:49,18 --> 0:13:51,97
INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT. THIS DETERMINES THE
DIRECTION


192
0:13:51,97 --> 0:13:55,23
THAT WATER MOVES. NOW, LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW
MORE


193
0:13:55,23 --> 0:13:58,74
EXAMPLES OF THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. HERE
IS


194
0:13:58,74 --> 0:14:1,82
A BEAKER OF WATER. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO THINK
OF THIS


195
0:14:1,82 --> 0:14:6,459
BEAKER OF WATER IN TERMS OF PERHAPS EVEN BEING
A LAKE.


196
0:14:6,459 --> 0:14:10,89
WE CAN ALSO HAVE A LAKE HERE. SO, LET'S SAY
WE HAVE


197
0:14:10,89 --> 0:14:14,75
A LAKE OR A BEAKER OF WATER AND I AM GOING
TO TELL YOU


198
0:14:14,75 --> 0:14:18,75
THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SOLUTES DISSOLVED
BOTH IN THE


199
0:14:18,75 --> 0:14:22,37
BEAKER AND PERHAPS IN THE LAKE, AS WELL. WE
CAN SAY


200
0:14:22,37 --> 0:14:27,5
THAT PSI'S OF PI FOR THE LAKE MIGHT BE CONCENTRATION


201
0:14:27,5 --> 0:14:32,1
4. AND FOR THE BEAKER WE WILL ALSO SAY PSI'S
OF PI IS


202
0:14:32,1 --> 0:14:35,82
 CONCENTRATION 4. JUST TO START OFF WITH.
NOW, YOU


203
0:14:35,82 --> 0:14:38,8
HAVE THE WATER POTENTIAL EQUATION, PSI EQUALS
PSI'S OF


204
0:14:38,8 --> 0:14:44,149
PI PLUS PSI'S OF P. AND IF I ASK YOU AT THIS
POINT,


205
0:14:44,149 --> 0:14:47,54
WHAT THEN WOULD BE THE WATER POTENTIAL OF
THE WATER IN


206
0:14:47,54 --> 0:14:53,62
THIS OPEN BEAKER OR THE WATER IN THE LAKE?
HOW COULD


207
0:14:53,62 --> 0:14:57,6
YOU FIGURE IT OUT BY HAVING ONLY ONE VALUE?
THAT IS,


208
0:14:57,6 --> 0:15:1,81
BY ONLY KNOWING THAT THIS VALUE HERE IS CONCENTRATION


209
0:15:1,81 --> 0:15:5,47
4. AND THE ANSWER IS, THAT IN SITUATIONS WHERE
YOU


210
0:15:5,47 --> 0:15:11,86
HAVE AN OPEN BODY OF WATER WHERE YOU HAVE
NO MEMBRANE


211
0:15:11,86 --> 0:15:16,67
THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY TO BUILD UP TURGOR
PRESSURE IN


212
0:15:16,67 --> 0:15:18,97
AN OPEN BODY. THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY TO BUILD
UP


213
0:15:18,97 --> 0:15:26,42
TURGOR PRESSURE. SO, IN THE ABSENCE OF THE
MEMBRANE


214
0:15:26,42 --> 0:15:31,49
AS YOU HAVE IN A LAKE OR A BEAKER OF WATER,
PSI'S OF


215
0:15:31,49 --> 0:15:37,829
PI EQUALS ZERO. SO, THE WATER POTENTIAL IN
THIS


216
0:15:37,829 --> 0:15:41,949
PARTICULAR CASE OF A LAKE OR THIS BEAKER EQUALS
THE


217
0:15:41,949 --> 0:15:44,57
SOLUTE POTENTIAL. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THIS
MEMBRANE


218
0:15:44,57 --> 0:15:49,36
THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD UP PRESSURE. NOW,
UP


219
0:15:49,36 --> 0:15:51,99
FRONT HERE I HAVE SOME EXAMPLES OF A PLANT
THAT SOME


220
0:15:51,99 --> 0:15:54,98
 OF YOU MAKE HAVE SEEN BEFORE OR MAYBE AS
A KID MAY


221
0:15:54,98 --> 0:15:57,93
HAVE TORMENTED A PLANT LIKE THIS. THIS IS
KNOWN AS


222
0:15:57,93 --> 0:16:0,269
A SENSITIVE PLANT. AND THE REASON THAT IT
IS


223
0:16:0,269 --> 0:16:3,36
A SENSITIVE PLANT IS BECAUSE WHEN IT IS TOUCHED,
AND I


224
0:16:3,36 --> 0:16:5,11
DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WILL DO IT NOW FOR US
BECAUSE IT


225
0:16:5,11 --> 0:16:7,61
IS QUITE SHY. BUT, WHEN IT IS TOUCHED I DON'T
KNOW IF


226
0:16:7,61 --> 0:16:13,51
MATT YOU CAN FOCUS ON THIS, THE LEAVES WILL
CLOSE AND


227
0:16:13,51 --> 0:16:18,13
THEY WILL EVEN COLLAPSE SOMEWHAT. NOW, THIS
CLOSURE


228
0:16:18,13 --> 0:16:21,149
OR THE COLLAPSE OF THE LEAVES PROBABLY SERVES
SOME


229
0:16:21,149 --> 0:16:25,42
TYPE OF A PROTECTIVE MECHANISM AS A WAY OF
REDUCING


230
0:16:25,42 --> 0:16:27,97
THE LEAF SURFACE PERHAPS WHEN AN ANIMAL LANDS
ON THE


231
0:16:27,97 --> 0:16:31,699
LEAF. BUT, IT IS ALSO RELATED TO CHANGES IN
WATER


232
0:16:31,699 --> 0:16:35,6
POTENTIAL. AND I WANT TO JUST BRIEFLY TELL
YOU WHAT


233
0:16:35,6 --> 0:16:37,649
IS GOING ON IN THIS LEAF AND HOW IT IS RELATED
TO


234
0:16:37,649 --> 0:16:40,54
WATER POTENTIAL. AND THEN MAYBE YOU COULD
MAKE


235
0:16:40,54 --> 0:16:42,85
A TABLE LIKE THIS FOR YOURSELF FOR THE LEAF.
SO,


236
0:16:42,85 --> 0:16:48,639
LET'S LOOK AT THE SENSITIVE PLANT. THE FIRST
THING


237
0:16:48,639 --> 0:16:55,699
THAT HAPPENS WITH TOUCH IS THAT IT, YOU STIMULATE
OR


238
0:16:55,699 --> 0:17:3,199
 YOU MAKE A SMALL ELECTRIC CURRENT. THIS
CAN ACTUALLY


239
0:17:3,199 --> 0:17:6,169
BE MEASURED ON METERS. IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR
US TO


240
0:17:6,169 --> 0:17:9,759
PERCEIVE OURSELVES BUT IT IS A SMALL ELECTRIC
CURRENT.


241
0:17:9,759 --> 0:17:19,409
THIS RESULTS IN A MOVEMENT OF OUR SAME ION
THAT WE SAW


242
0:17:19,409 --> 0:17:26,49
ON THE STOMATA, A POTASSIUM FROM THE LEAF
INTO THE


243
0:17:26,49 --> 0:17:32,419
STEM. MOVEMENT OF POTASSIUM FROM THE LEAF
IN THE


244
0:17:32,419 --> 0:17:46,82
STEM. THIS THEN CAUSES THE PSI OF THE LEAF
TO BECOME,


245
0:17:46,82 --> 0:17:53,82
IN THIS CASE, MORE POSITIVE AND WATER LEAVES
THE LEAF


246
0:17:53,82 --> 0:18:5,49
AND GOES TO THE STEM. AND THE LEAF COLLAPSES.


247
0:18:5,49 --> 0:18:14,539
THE LEAF COLLAPSES.


248
0:18:14,539 --> 0:18:19,659
SO, HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF WATER BEING PRESSURE


249
0:18:19,659 --> 0:18:22,97
OR POSITIVE PRESSURE OF THE WATER HOLDING
THE LEAF UP


250
0:18:22,97 --> 0:18:25,549
AND WHEN YOU CAUSE THAT PRESSURE TO DROP BY
HAVING THE


251
0:18:25,549 --> 0:18:28,519
POTASSIUM GO OUT, YOU CHANGE THE WATER POTENTIAL
AND


252
0:18:28,519 --> 0:18:32,46
THE WATER LEAVES AND THEN THE LEAFLET DROPS.


253
0:18:32,46 --> 0:18:35,22
NOW, LET ME GIVE YOU A SITUATION WHICH IS


254
0:18:35,22 --> 0:18:38,159
A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED. BUT, ACTUALLY PROBABLY


255
0:18:38,159 --> 0:18:41,499
SUMMARIZES NICELY WHAT WE WILL SAY IN THIS
LECTURE AND


256
0:18:41,499 --> 0:18:44,549
 WHAT WE HAVE SAID UP TO THIS POINT ABOUT
WATER. THIS


257
0:18:44,549 --> 0:18:47,299
IS AN UNUSUAL SITUATION, BUT WHAT I WANT YOU
TO THINK


258
0:18:47,299 --> 0:18:50,2
ABOUT. I AM GOING TO DRAW TWO CELLS IN THIS


259
0:18:50,2 --> 0:18:53,789
SITUATION. I AM GOING TO DRAW A PARENCHYMA
CELL. WE


260
0:18:53,789 --> 0:19:0,929
ARE ALSO GOING TO MAKE A TABLE AS WE HAD BEFORE.
AND,


261
0:19:0,929 --> 0:19:3,789
NEXT TO THIS PARENCHYMA CELL I AM GOING TO
PUT A XYLEM


262
0:19:3,789 --> 0:19:12,389
ELEMENT. A XYLEM ELEMENT. AND, FOR THIS PARTICULAR


263
0:19:12,389 --> 0:19:16,769
XYLEM ELEMENT I AM GOING TO SAY THAT THEY
ARE IN


264
0:19:16,769 --> 0:19:22,899
EQUILIBRIUM


265
0:19:22,899 --> 0:19:29,389
WITH REGARD TO PSI. THAT IS, PSI OF THE


266
0:19:29,389 --> 0:19:37,919
XYLEM EQUALS THE PSI OF THE PARENCHYMA. AND
NOW WHAT


267
0:19:37,919 --> 0:19:44,8
I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO MAKE A TABLE JUST
AS WE DID


268
0:19:44,8 --> 0:19:49,19
FOR THE STOMATA TO CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS


269
0:19:49,19 --> 0:19:53,809
COMPONENTS THAT ALLOW THESE TWO CELLS TO HAVE
THE SAME


270
0:19:53,809 --> 0:19:57,669
WATER POTENTIAL. SO, ON THIS PARTICULAR ONE,
I THINK


271
0:19:57,669 --> 0:19:59,389
I WILL JUST DO THE WHOLE THING DIFFERENTLY.
ON THIS


272
0:19:59,389 --> 0:20:4,8
PARTICULAR ONE, WE WILL PUT, WE WILL HAVE
THE XYLEM


273
0:20:4,8 --> 0:20:11,69
AND THE PARENCHYMA. AND WE WILL LOOK NOW AT
THE THREE


274
0:20:11,69 --> 0:20:16,159
ELEMENTS WHICH MAKE UP THE WATER POTENTIAL
OF THESE


275
0:20:16,159 --> 0:20:23,57
 TWO CELLS. WE WILL LOOK AT PSI, PSI'S OF
PI, AND


276
0:20:23,57 --> 0:20:25,779
PSI'S OF P.


277
0:20:25,779 --> 0:20:27,899
NOW THE FIRST THING I WANT TO ASK YOU AND
THIS


278
0:20:27,899 --> 0:20:30,919
SHOULD BE IN YOUR MIND, IS WHAT IS THE REAL
BASIC


279
0:20:30,919 --> 0:20:32,979
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PARENCHYMA CELL AND
THE XYLEM


280
0:20:32,979 --> 0:20:36,169
CELL, THE VESSEL?


281
0:20:36,169 --> 0:20:40,34
WHAT ABOUT THE XYLEM CELL? XYLEM CELL IS DEAD


282
0:20:40,34 --> 0:20:43,509
COMPARED TO THE PARENCHYMA CELL. THE PARENCHYMA
CELL


283
0:20:43,509 --> 0:20:48,96
HAS THEREFORE, A MEMBRANE. IT IS ALIVE.


284
0:20:48,96 --> 0:20:56,359
SO, THIS CELL IS ALIVE. THIS CELL IS DEAD.


285
0:20:56,359 --> 0:20:58,649
AND YET I TOLD YOU THAT THESE TWO CELLS ARE
IN


286
0:20:58,649 --> 0:21:2,99
EQUILIBRIUM WITH REGARD TO THEIR WATER POTENTIALS.


287
0:21:2,99 --> 0:21:5,49
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE IF ONE IS ALIVE AND OF
THEM IS


288
0:21:5,49 --> 0:21:8,71
DEAD? ALL EQUILIBRIUM MEANS IS THAT THE WATER


289
0:21:8,71 --> 0:21:12,21
POTENTIALS ARE THE SAME AND THAT THERE IS
NO NET


290
0:21:12,21 --> 0:21:21,409
MOVEMENT OF WATER. SO, LET'S BEGIN BECAUSE
WE SAID


291
0:21:21,409 --> 0:21:23,97
THAT THEY ARE AT EQUILIBRIUM. LET'S BEGIN
BY PUTTING


292
0:21:23,97 --> 0:21:27,36
ON NUMBERS FOR THE WATER POTENTIAL FOR BOTH
THE XYLEM


293
0:21:27,36 --> 0:21:29,9
 AND THE PARENCHYMA CELL.


294
0:21:29,9 --> 0:21:32,619
AND A REASONABLE NUMBER FROM BOTH CELLS IS


295
0:21:32,619 --> 0:21:35,239
CONCENTRATION 8. CONCENTRATION 8 BARS FOR
THE WATER


296
0:21:35,239 --> 0:21:40,149
POTENTIAL. NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THE OTHER COMPONENTS


297
0:21:40,149 --> 0:21:43,47
WHICH MAKE THIS UP. FIRST OF ALL, THE PARENCHYMA
CELL


298
0:21:43,47 --> 0:21:48,19
IS ALIVE. SO, BECAUSE IT IS ALIVE, IT IS GOING
TO BE


299
0:21:48,19 --> 0:21:52,99
ABLE TO CONCENTRATE SOME SALTS AND ALSO GOING
TO BE


300
0:21:52,99 --> 0:21:54,71
ABLE TO HAVE A TURGOR PRESSURE. SO, A REASONABLE


301
0:21:54,71 --> 0:21:57,639
VALUE FOR THE SALTS IN A PARENCHYMA CELL ARE


302
0:21:57,639 --> 0:22:0,549
CONCENTRATION 3. PLUS 3, CONCENTRATION 3,
SORRY.


303
0:22:0,549 --> 0:22:2,229
CONCENTRATION 3 FOR THE SALTS.


304
0:22:2,229 --> 0:22:6,649
I HAVE THIS RIGHT OVER HERE. REASONABLE VALUE,


305
0:22:6,649 --> 0:22:9,409
SORRY. REASONABLE VALUE TO THE SALTS IS CONCENTRATION


306
0:22:9,409 --> 0:22:12,129
11 IN THE PARENCHYMA CELLS. THESE ARE CELLS
NOW WHICH


307
0:22:12,129 --> 0:22:16,259
CAN CONCENTRATE THEIR SOLUTES BECAUSE OF THEIR


308
0:22:16,259 --> 0:22:19,999
MEMBRANE. NOW, THIS IS WHERE THE CHANGE IN
YOUR


309
0:22:19,999 --> 0:22:22,559
PERSPECTIVE HAS TO COME ABOUT. WHAT WOULD
BE


310
0:22:22,559 --> 0:22:26,69
A REASONABLE VALUE FOR THE CONCENTRATION OF
THE SALTS


311
0:22:26,69 --> 0:22:31,309
 IN THE XYLEM? WOULD IT BE MORE NEGATIVE
OR LESS


312
0:22:31,309 --> 0:22:35,279
NEGATIVE? LESS NEGATIVE. AND THE REASON IT
IS LESS


313
0:22:35,279 --> 0:22:38,109
NEGATIVE, THAT IS THE CORRECT ANSWER, IS BECAUSE
THE


314
0:22:38,109 --> 0:22:42,119
XYLEM CELL NOT HAVING A MEMBRANE CANNOT CONCENTRATE


315
0:22:42,119 --> 0:22:47,509
SALTS. SO, THE SOLUTES IN THE XYLEM MORE OR
LESS


316
0:22:47,509 --> 0:22:50,309
REFLECT WHAT THE SALT CONCENTRATION IS IN
THE SOIL, IN


317
0:22:50,309 --> 0:22:53,379
THE WATER THAT IS COMING IN. IT CANNOT MAKE
THE SALTS


318
0:22:53,379 --> 0:22:57,989
ANY MORE CONCENTRATED. AND SO FOR THE XYLEM,


319
0:22:57,989 --> 0:23:1,19
A REASONABLE VALUE FOR THE SALT CONCENTRATION
IS, IT


320
0:23:1,19 --> 0:23:4,7
IS NOT PURE, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY NOT AS HIGH
AS


321
0:23:4,7 --> 0:23:11,149
A CELL, BUT CAN CONCENTRATE IT. AND NOW, IF
WE LOOK


322
0:23:11,149 --> 0:23:16,82
AT THE LAST COMPONENT, PSI'S OF P, AND FOR
BOTH THE


323
0:23:16,82 --> 0:23:20,609
PARENCHYMA AND THE XYLEM, BECAUSE WE HAVE
A LIVING


324
0:23:20,609 --> 0:23:23,629
CELL WHICH IS CONCENTRATED SOLUTES WE CAN
NOW DEVELOP


325
0:23:23,629 --> 0:23:26,249
A TURGOR PRESSURE. SO, REASONABLE VALUE FOR
THE


326
0:23:26,249 --> 0:23:28,989
TURGOR PRESSURE WOULD BE 3. POSITIVE 3.


327
0:23:28,989 --> 0:23:33,29
AND NOW, I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO SWITCH YOUR


328
0:23:33,29 --> 0:23:38,33
THINKING AGAIN. WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE
VALUE FOR


329
0:23:38,33 --> 0:23:42,7
 PSI'S OF P IN THE XYLEM? THIS CELL IS DEAD.
AND


330
0:23:42,7 --> 0:23:44,849
BECAUSE IT IS DEAD IT CANNOT HAVE A TURGOR
PRESSURE.


331
0:23:44,849 --> 0:23:48,409
AND THIS CELL IS ALSO UNDER TENSION. AND YOU
RECALL


332
0:23:48,409 --> 0:23:51,229
LAST TIME THAT WE SAID PSI'S OF P CAN BE POSITIVE
IN


333
0:23:51,229 --> 0:23:55,32
TERMS OF TURGOR PRESSURE OR NEGATIVE WHEN
THE WATER


334
0:23:55,32 --> 0:23:59,649
COLUMN AS IT IS IN THE XYLEM IS BEING STRETCHED.
SO,


335
0:23:59,649 --> 0:24:3,229
WHAT WOULD BE THE STATE OF PSI'S OF P IN THE
XYLEM?


336
0:24:3,229 --> 0:24:7,779
A REASONABLE VALUE WOULD BE CONCENTRATION
7.5.


337
0:24:7,779 --> 0:24:12,94
CONCENTRATION 7.5. SO, HERE WE HAVE A SITUATION
IN


338
0:24:12,94 --> 0:24:17,129
WHICH WE HAVE A NEGATIVE WATER, A NEGATIVE
PSI'S OF P


339
0:24:17,129 --> 0:24:20,179
IN A CELL DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO ONE WITH A
POSITIVE


340
0:24:20,179 --> 0:24:24,679
PSI'S OF P. BUT, NOW IF YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER
PSI


341
0:24:24,679 --> 0:24:29,83
EQUAL PSI'S OF PI PLUS PSI'S OF P YOU NOTICE
THAT THE


342
0:24:29,83 --> 0:24:33,46
PSI'S COME OUT TO BE THE SAME. THESE CELLS
ARE AT


343
0:24:33,46 --> 0:24:36,759
EQUILIBRIUM WITH REGARD TO THEIR WATER POTENTIAL,
BUT


344
0:24:36,759 --> 0:24:39,969
NOT WITH REGARD TO THE COMPONENTS THAT MAKE
UP THE


345
0:24:39,969 --> 0:24:43,429
WATER POTENTIAL. AND THAT IS WHY THE MOVEMENT
OF


346
0:24:43,429 --> 0:24:48,389
WATER IS DETERMINED BY THIS NUMBER, THE WATER
 POTENTIAL NUMBER. AND NOT BY THE NUMBER


347
0:24:48,389 --> 0:24:49,549
WHICH YOU


348
0:24:49,549 --> 0:24:52,279
MIGHT GET ONLY FOR THE TURGOR PRESSURE OR
FOR THE


349
0:24:52,279 --> 0:24:56,889
SOLUTE POTENTIAL. FINALLY, BEFORE MOVING ON
I WANT TO


350
0:24:56,889 --> 0:25:0,57
RETURN TO A PICTURE WHICH WE PUT UP ON THE
BOARD, AND


351
0:25:0,57 --> 0:25:3,919
THAT PICTURE HAD TO DO WITH THE PLUMBING SYSTEM
OF THE


352
0:25:3,919 --> 0:25:7,45
PLANT. JUST TO REVIEW A POINT THAT WE MENTIONED
LAST


353
0:25:7,45 --> 0:25:11,82
TIME. IF WE LOOK AT THE PLUMBING SYSTEM OF
THE PLANT


354
0:25:11,82 --> 0:25:20,509
NOW AND WE PUT ON VALUES FOR PSI, FOR THE
ATMOSPHERE


355
0:25:20,509 --> 0:25:24,49
ON A DRY DAY WHEN THERE IS NOT MUCH WATER
IN THE


356
0:25:24,49 --> 0:25:28,979
ATMOSPHERE, PSI MIGHT EQUAL CONCENTRATION
40. PRETTY


357
0:25:28,979 --> 0:25:33,659
LOW NUMBER. IF WE LOOK AT THE PSI'S OF NOW
THE


358
0:25:33,659 --> 0:25:38,679
TISSUES WHICH MAKE UP THE STEM, THE PSI FOR
THE LEAF


359
0:25:38,679 --> 0:25:41,309
MIGHT EQUAL CONCENTRATION 8, NOT AN UNREASONABLE


360
0:25:41,309 --> 0:25:47,509
VALUE. FOR THE STEM, PSI EQUALS PERHAPS CONCENTRATION


361
0:25:47,509 --> 0:25:53,469
5. AND MAYBE FOR THE ROOTS PSI EQUALS MAYBE


362
0:25:53,469 --> 0:25:57,879
CONCENTRATION 2 OR 3. CONCENTRATION 2 OR 3.
SO, WHAT


363
0:25:57,879 --> 0:26:0,869
I WANT YOU TO NOTICE HERE AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT


364
0:26:0,869 --> 0:26:3,809
TAKE HOME MESSAGE, IS THAT, I WILL WRITE IT
OUT FOR


365
0:26:3,809 --> 0:26:16,309
 YOU. WATER IS MOVING ALONG A GRADIENT OF
INCREASINGLY


366
0:26:16,309 --> 0:26:32,349
NEGATIVE PSI'S. SO IN A PLANT TRANSPIRATION
OCCURS,


367
0:26:32,349 --> 0:26:35,379
WE SAID, BECAUSE OF THE PULL OF THE WATER
MOLECULES.


368
0:26:35,379 --> 0:26:38,58
BECAUSE THIS PULLS THEM UP TO THE TOP, BUT
REALLY IT


369
0:26:38,58 --> 0:26:42,719
OCCURS BECAUSE OF THIS GRADIENT INSIDE GOING
FROM THE


370
0:26:42,719 --> 0:26:45,82
SOIL UP TO THE ATMOSPHERE WITH THE PLANT BEING
THE


371
0:26:45,82 --> 0:26:49,299
SORT OF INTERMEDIATE PATHWAY THAT ALLOWS FOR


372
0:26:49,299 --> 0:26:54,309
TRANSPIRATION TO OCCUR. HAVING TALKED A BIT
ABOUT THE


373
0:26:54,309 --> 0:26:56,789
XYLEM I WANTED TO JUST MENTION TO YOU THE
OTHER


374
0:26:56,789 --> 0:26:59,149
TRANSPORT SYSTEM THAT A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE
ALREADY


375
0:26:59,149 --> 0:27:3,929
ASKED ME ABOUT. AND THAT IS THE PHLOEM. THE
XYLEM,


376
0:27:3,929 --> 0:27:6,849
WHICH WE SAID IS THE PRIMARY TRANSPORT SYSTEM
FOR


377
0:27:6,849 --> 0:27:11,57
WATER. THE PHLOEM IS THE PRIMARY TRANSPORT
SYSTEM FOR


378
0:27:11,57 --> 0:27:15,19
SUGARS, FOR FIXED PHOTOSYNTHATE. I WOULD LIKE
TO JUST


379
0:27:15,19 --> 0:27:18,71
BRIEFLY MENTION TO YOU HOW THE PHLOEM WORKS
AND THEN


380
0:27:18,71 --> 0:27:20,609
WE CAN SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING AT SOME INTERESTING


381
0:27:20,609 --> 0:27:23,2
PICTURES THAT I THINK YOU WILL ENJOY LOOKING
AT. SO,


382
0:27:23,2 --> 0:27:26,919
LET'S LOOK AT THE MAIN ELEMENT OF THE PHLOEM,
WHICH IS


383
0:27:26,919 --> 0:27:33,549
 THE SIEVE ELEMENT.


384
0:27:33,549 --> 0:27:34,809
BECAUSE THE XYLEM AND PHLOEM ARE


385
0:27:34,809 --> 0:27:37,639
CLOSELY ASSOCIATED AS YOU REMEMBERED SEEING
IN BASKET


386
0:27:37,639 --> 0:27:45,469
OR BUNDLES, NEXT TO IT WE WOULD HAVE A XYLEM
ELEMENT.


387
0:27:45,469 --> 0:27:47,679
NOW, THE SUGARS ARE NOT MADE IN THE SIEVE
ELEMENT.


388
0:27:47,679 --> 0:27:50,259
THEY ARE JUST TRANSPORTED IN THE SIEVE ELEMENT
SO THE


389
0:27:50,259 --> 0:27:53,539
LAST COMPONENT WHICH WE HAVE TO PUT ON HERE
IS THE


390
0:27:53,539 --> 0:28:5,39
LEAF CELL WHERE SUGARS ARE MADE. NOW BEFORE
WE GO


391
0:28:5,39 --> 0:28:9,8
THROUGH THE STEPS TO INDICATE TO YOU HOW SUGARS
ARE


392
0:28:9,8 --> 0:28:11,94
MOVED IN THE PHLOEM, I HAVE TO AGAIN POINT
OUT TO YOU


393
0:28:11,94 --> 0:28:14,559
A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE
OF. AND


394
0:28:14,559 --> 0:28:18,929
THOSE MAIN ASPECTS ARE THAT THE LEAF CELL
AND THE


395
0:28:18,929 --> 0:28:24,99
SIEVE ELEMENT ARE BOTH ALIVE. BOTH HAVE MEMBRANES.


396
0:28:24,99 --> 0:28:36,349
SO, LET'S NOW CONSIDER THE STEPS THAT ARE
INVOLVED IN


397
0:28:36,349 --> 0:28:39,899
THE MOVEMENT OF SUGARS IN THE PHLOEM AND HOW
THE


398
0:28:39,899 --> 0:28:45,57
PHLOEM WORKS TO TRANSPORT THE SUGARS. THE
FIRST THING


399
0:28:45,57 --> 0:28:53,9
THAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE SUGARS ARE MOVED
INTO THE


400
0:28:53,9 --> 0:29:0,39
PHLOEM.


401
0:29:0,39 --> 0:29:2,359
AND THIS MOVEMENT INTO THE PHLOEM TAKES PLACE


402
0:29:2,359 --> 0:29:11,82
ACROSS A MEMBRANE AND PEOPLE CALL THIS MOVEMENT
 LOADING. AND BECAUSE THE PLACE THAT THEY


403
0:29:11,82 --> 0:29:12,339
ARE LOADED


404
0:29:12,339 --> 0:29:21,629
FROM IS A LEAF, THE LEAF IS CALLED A SOURCE.
SO,


405
0:29:21,629 --> 0:29:26,509
SUGARS ARE MOVED INTO THE PHLOEM. WE HAVE
SUGARS,


406
0:29:26,509 --> 0:29:35,19
THEY ARE LOADING. THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS
IS THAT


407
0:29:35,19 --> 0:29:47,419
WE NOW HAVE MADE THE PSI OF THE PHLOEM MORE
NEGATIVE.


408
0:29:47,419 --> 0:29:50,399
BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE SOLUTES THERE NOW. MORE


409
0:29:50,399 --> 0:30:4,94
NEGATIVE. THIS RESULTS IN WATER ENTERING THE
PHLOEM


410
0:30:4,94 --> 0:30:10,499
AT THE TOP, AT THE SOURCE LET'S SAY. AND THE
WATER


411
0:30:10,499 --> 0:30:20,219
COMES FROM THE XYLEM.


412
0:30:20,219 --> 0:30:22,389
SO, IN THIS SITUATION AFTER THE


413
0:30:22,389 --> 0:30:27,71
SUGARS ARE LOADED IN TO THE SIEVE ELEMENT
WE HAVE


414
0:30:27,71 --> 0:30:30,789
WATER MOVING IN BECAUSE OF A CHANGE IN WATER


415
0:30:30,789 --> 0:30:36,909
POTENTIAL.


416
0:30:36,909 --> 0:30:39,229
BECAUSE THE PHLOEM IS ALIVE NOW, WE NOW


417
0:30:39,229 --> 0:30:49,259
HAVE A INCREASE IN PRESSURE AT THE SITE OF
LOADING.


418
0:30:49,259 --> 0:30:53,7
THE SITE OF LOADING.


419
0:30:53,7 --> 0:30:55,919
AND THIS IS REALLY NOW HOW THE PHLOEM WORKS.


420
0:30:55,919 --> 0:30:58,44
WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS YOUR
GARDEN


421
0:30:58,44 --> 0:31:1,219
HOSE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE AT HOME. IN THE GARDEN
HOSE,


422
0:31:1,219 --> 0:31:4,619
AT ONE END OF THE HOSE YOU HAVE THE PRESSURE,
WHICH IS


423
0:31:4,619 --> 0:31:7,889
 THE MAIN WATER LINE COMING IN. AND AT THE
OTHER END


424
0:31:7,889 --> 0:31:10,739
YOU HAVE AN OPENING OF THE HOSE AND THE WATER
COMES


425
0:31:10,739 --> 0:31:13,83
OUT, SO IF YOU COULD PUT A BLUE DROP OF DYE
IN THE


426
0:31:13,83 --> 0:31:16,959
WATER AT THE PLACE THE HOSE IS ATTACHED TO
THE FAUCET,


427
0:31:16,959 --> 0:31:19,639
YOU WOULD FIND THAT THAT BLUE DROP OF DYE
WOULD MOVE


428
0:31:19,639 --> 0:31:23,289
DOWN. THE MOVEMENT IN THE PHLOEM OCCURS EXACTLY
THE


429
0:31:23,289 --> 0:31:28,619
SAME WAY. THE INCREASE IN PRESSURE ESSENTIALLY
PUSHES


430
0:31:28,619 --> 0:31:32,159
THE SUGARS DOWN AND THIS PUSHING OF THE SUGAR
DOWN IS


431
0:31:32,159 --> 0:31:41,719
KNOWN AS MASS FLOW.


432
0:31:41,719 --> 0:31:43,359
BUT, EVENTUALLY THE PHLOEM SHOULD


433
0:31:43,359 --> 0:31:45,219
JUST CLOG UP. I MEAN YOU ARE JUST GOING TO
BE PUSHING


434
0:31:45,219 --> 0:31:47,849
THE SUGARS DOWN AND EVENTUALLY THE WHOLE PHLOEM
SHOULD


435
0:31:47,849 --> 0:31:52,649
BE FULL OF SUGAR. WELL, THE LAST STEP IN THE
PROCESS


436
0:31:52,649 --> 0:31:57,509
IS THAT AT THE BASE, WHICH I HAVE DRAWN HERE.
AT THE


437
0:31:57,509 --> 0:32:5,349
BASE, WE HAVE UNLOADING.


438
0:32:5,349 --> 0:32:8,179
UNLOADING. AND, YOU COULD


439
0:32:8,179 --> 0:32:14,229
VIEW THAT UNLOADING AT BEING A PARENCHYMA
CELL. IT


440
0:32:14,229 --> 0:32:17,889
MIGHT BE, FOR EXAMPLE, A TUBER, LIKE A POTATO
TUBER,


441
0:32:17,889 --> 0:32:21,479
OR IT MIGHT BE A ROOT, LIKE A BEET ROOT, WHICH
IS VERY


442
0:32:21,479 --> 0:32:30,779
SWEET. THE SUGARS ARE NOW ACTIVELY MOVED ACROSS.
 SUGARS MOVE INTO THE ADJACENT CELL. WELL,


443
0:32:30,779 --> 0:32:31,249
AS SOON AS


444
0:32:31,249 --> 0:32:34,519
THAT HAPPENS, THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE WATER
TO STAY


445
0:32:34,519 --> 0:32:37,279
HERE ANY MORE. BECAUSE, THE WATER POTENTIAL
HAS


446
0:32:37,279 --> 0:32:42,929
CHANGED AND THE WATER THEN MOVED BACK INTO
THE XYLEM.


447
0:32:42,929 --> 0:32:45,609
AND THIS IS RESULTED IN A DROP IN THE PRESSURE.


448
0:32:45,609 --> 0:32:48,29
RESULTS IN A REDUCTION OF THE PRESSURE AT
THE BASE.


449
0:32:48,29 --> 0:33:4,469
SO, THE


450
0:33:4,469 --> 0:33:7,509
PHLOEM WORKS BY ESSENTIALLY HAVING A PRESSURE


451
0:33:7,509 --> 0:33:10,239
GRADIENT. PRESSURE IS HIGH AT THE TOP BECAUSE
SUGARS


452
0:33:10,239 --> 0:33:13,57
ARE LOADED IN. WATER COMES IN AT THE TOP.
THAT WATER


453
0:33:13,57 --> 0:33:16,129
CARRIES THE SUGARS DOWN TO THE BOTTOM. THE
SUGARS ARE


454
0:33:16,129 --> 0:33:19,149
REMOVED. THE PRESSURE DROPS. IT IS THE SAME
AS YOUR


455
0:33:19,149 --> 0:33:23,32
GARDEN HOSE. SO, THE PHLOEM IS UNDER PRESSURE.
ALL


456
0:33:23,32 --> 0:33:26,259
OF YOU HAVE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED THIS PRESSURE
WHETHER


457
0:33:26,259 --> 0:33:29,169
YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT IN THE PHLOEM. IF YOU
CUT A


458
0:33:29,169 --> 0:33:32,119
PLANT FROM THE STEM FOR A SMALL PERIOD OF
TIME THE


459
0:33:32,119 --> 0:33:35,359
PLANT WILL BLEED. THIS BLEEDING IS THE LIQUID
WHICH


460
0:33:35,359 --> 0:33:38,19
IS BEING PUSHED OUT IN THE PHLOEM. BUT, A
WAY THAT


461
0:33:38,19 --> 0:33:40,539
PERHAPS MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS,
AND I WILL


462
0:33:40,539 --> 0:33:43,739
 SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF THIS IN A MOMENT,
IF WE CAN GET


463
0:33:43,739 --> 0:33:47,899
THE COMPUTER TO WORK, IS THAT IF YOU WALK
DOWN STREETS


464
0:33:47,899 --> 0:33:52,479
ON A WARM SUMMER DAY AND YOUR FEET STICK TO
THE


465
0:33:52,479 --> 0:33:56,33
STREET, YOUR FEET IS STICKING TO MATERIAL
WHICH HAS


466
0:33:56,33 --> 0:34:0,799
ACTUALLY COME OUT OF THE TREES AND HAS BEEN
EXUDED BY


467
0:34:0,799 --> 0:34:3,95
THE TREES AS DROPLETS. AND, IT COLLECTS ON
THE


468
0:34:3,95 --> 0:34:7,849
WINDSHIELDS OF YOUR CAR OR ON THE SIDEWALKS
AND IT IS


469
0:34:7,849 --> 0:34:10,279
REALLY SUGAR. AND THAT IS WHY YOUR FEET STICK
TO IT.


470
0:34:10,279 --> 0:34:14,79
NOW, HOW DOES THAT LIQUID GET OUT? THIS NEXT
SLIDE


471
0:34:14,79 --> 0:34:17,44
WILL SHOW YOU HOW THE LIQUID GETS OUT. SO,
ONE OF THE


472
0:34:17,44 --> 0:34:21,639
THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS THAT APHIDS LIKE TO
FEED ON


473
0:34:21,639 --> 0:34:25,99
PLANTS AND APHIDS ARE VERY GOOD IN THE FACT
THAT THEY


474
0:34:25,99 --> 0:34:28,45
CAN TAKE THEIR STYLET, THE THING THAT ACTUALLY
ALLOWS


475
0:34:28,45 --> 0:34:31,339
THEM TO FEED ON THE PLANTS AND THEY CAN INSERT
IT


476
0:34:31,339 --> 0:34:34,819
DIRECTLY INTO THE PHLOEM. SO HERE IS THE APHID
STYLET


477
0:34:34,819 --> 0:34:37,49
WHICH IS ON THE OUTSIDE. THIS IS A CROSS SECTION
OF


478
0:34:37,49 --> 0:34:40,669
A TREE. YOU ALL SHOULD RECOGNIZE THIS AS THE
BARK.


479
0:34:40,669 --> 0:34:43,129
AND THE APHID IS ABLE, WE ARE NOT SURE HOW
IT IS ABLE


480
0:34:43,129 --> 0:34:46,539
 TO DO IT, TO INSERT ITS STYLET AND TO GO
DOWN THROUGH


481
0:34:46,539 --> 0:34:49,829
ALL OF THE OLDER PHLOEM UNTIL IT REACHES THE
NEWEST


482
0:34:49,829 --> 0:34:52,819
AND MOST ACTIVELY TRANSPORTING LAYER OF PHLOEM.
AND


483
0:34:52,819 --> 0:34:56,849
HERE IS THE STYLET INSIDE OF A SIEVE ELEMENT.
NOW,


484
0:34:56,849 --> 0:35:0,2
ONCE IN THIS SIEVE ELEMENT WE SAID THAT THE
MATERIAL


485
0:35:0,2 --> 0:35:2,64
IN THE PHLOEM IS UNDER PRESSURE. AND IT IS
UNDER


486
0:35:2,64 --> 0:35:4,99
PRESSURE BECAUSE OF THIS MASS FLOW. BECAUSE
OF THE


487
0:35:4,99 --> 0:35:8,44
TURGOR PRESSURE. AND SO LIQUID IS ESSENTIALLY
PUMPED


488
0:35:8,44 --> 0:35:10,94
UP THROUGH THE APHID. THE APHID JUST SITS
THERE AND


489
0:35:10,94 --> 0:35:14,789
LET'S THE LIQUID GO THROUGH IT AND THE DROPLET
OF THE


490
0:35:14,789 --> 0:35:18,39
LIQUID EXUDES THROUGH THE APHID AND THIS DROPLET


491
0:35:18,39 --> 0:35:21,76
ACTUALLY CONTAINS THE SUGARS. THE APHID HAS
TAKEN OUT


492
0:35:21,76 --> 0:35:26,69
SOME MATERIAL FROM THE LIQUID AS IT HAS GONE
THROUGH


493
0:35:26,69 --> 0:35:28,89
ITS BODY BUT IT CAN'T TAKE OUT ALL OF THE
SUGARS SO


494
0:35:28,89 --> 0:35:31,41
THE DROPLET WHICH FALLS ON TO THE GROUND OR
ON TO YOUR


495
0:35:31,41 --> 0:35:34,64
WINDSHIELD STILL CONTAINS A LOT OF SUGARS
AND IS


496
0:35:34,64 --> 0:35:37,4
ACTUALLY QUITE NUTRITIOUS. AND FOR THOSE OF
YOU WHO


497
0:35:37,4 --> 0:35:41,17
HAVE A BIBLICAL OR A HISTORICAL BENT, IT IS
THOUGHT


498
0:35:41,17 --> 0:35:44,769
 THAT THESE MATERIALS ACTUALLY WERE WHAT
THE ISRAELITES


499
0:35:44,769 --> 0:35:48,299
SUPPOSEDLY CALLED MANA. IT WAS THE SUGAR (INAUDIBLE)


500
0:35:48,299 --> 0:35:53,19
WHICH CAME FROM THE APHIDS. FINALLY IN THE
LAST TEN


501
0:35:53,19 --> 0:35:55,42
OR FIFTEEN MINUTES I WANT TO BRING UP A TOPIC
THAT I


502
0:35:55,42 --> 0:35:59,99
GET MORE QUESTIONS ON FROM YOU THAN ANY OTHER
TOPIC IN


503
0:35:59,99 --> 0:36:2,65
THIS CLASS. PROBABLY BECAUSE IT IS ONE THAT
HAS THE


504
0:36:2,65 --> 0:36:5,369
GREATEST PRACTICAL VALUE, AT LEAST WHAT I
THINK OF IT.


505
0:36:5,369 --> 0:36:8,339
AND THAT QUESTION IS, HERE IS THE PLANT THAT
IS


506
0:36:8,339 --> 0:36:11,94
GROWING IN MY DORM. IT LOOKS REALLY CRUMMY.
WHAT IS


507
0:36:11,94 --> 0:36:14,79
WRONG WITH THIS PLANT? CAN YOU HELP ME FIGURE
OUT


508
0:36:14,79 --> 0:36:16,579
WHAT IS GOING ON SO I CAN MAKE MY PLANTS LOOK
BETTER


509
0:36:16,579 --> 0:36:19,59
AND MY ROOMMATES WON'T THINK SO POORLY OF
ME. ALL


510
0:36:19,59 --> 0:36:23,779
RIGHT? NOW, ASSUMING THAT THE PLANT DOESN'T
HAVE


511
0:36:23,779 --> 0:36:26,359
A DISEASE LIKE A PATHOGEN OR A FUNGAL DISEASE
OR AN


512
0:36:26,359 --> 0:36:29,43
INSECT THAT IS EATING IT. IN MOST CASES WHEN
PLANTS


513
0:36:29,43 --> 0:36:32,799
LOOK BAD, IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE SUFFERING
FROM


514
0:36:32,799 --> 0:36:36,299
A DEFICIENCY OF SOME ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT OR
MINERAL


515
0:36:36,299 --> 0:36:40,63
THAT THE SOIL PROVIDES. WE SAID WHEN WE TALKED
ABOUT


516
0:36:40,63 --> 0:36:50,26
 PLANTS, WE SAID THAT GIVEN WATER, CO2 AND
SUNLIGHT


517
0:36:50,26 --> 0:36:53,299
THAT ALL PLANTS BASICALLY COULD LIVE AS LONG
AS THEY


518
0:36:53,299 --> 0:36:56,96
ARE PROVIDED ONE ADDITIONAL COMPONENT OR COMPONENTS.


519
0:36:56,96 --> 0:37:5,26
AND THOSE COMPONENTS ARE MINERALS FROM THE
SOIL. AND


520
0:37:5,26 --> 0:37:7,589
SO, I WOULD LIKE TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME
OF THESE


521
0:37:7,589 --> 0:37:10,45
NUTRIENTS AND MINERALS. MANY OF THEM ARE ONES
THAT


522
0:37:10,45 --> 0:37:13,589
YOU HAVE HEARD OF BEFORE. I WANT TO GIVE YOU
AN


523
0:37:13,589 --> 0:37:17,829
EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAPPENED. LET'S TALK ABOUT
A PLANT


524
0:37:17,829 --> 0:37:23,2
WHICH YOU BUY IN A NURSERY AND THE PLANT LOOKS
REALLY


525
0:37:23,2 --> 0:37:26,91
GOOD FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. AND THEN AS THE
PLANT


526
0:37:26,91 --> 0:37:32,49
GROWS IT STARTS TO SHOW SOME SIGNS OF LOOKING
POORLY.


527
0:37:32,49 --> 0:37:35,569
THOSE POOR SIGNS ARE BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY
MISSING AN


528
0:37:35,569 --> 0:37:38,579
ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT OR ESSENTIAL MINERAL. NOW
WHAT WE


529
0:37:38,579 --> 0:37:41,869
WANT TO DO IS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE ESSENTIAL


530
0:37:41,869 --> 0:37:45,41
NUTRIENTS OR MINERALS ARE THAT THE PLANT GETS
FROM THE


531
0:37:45,41 --> 0:37:47,97
SOIL. AND THE FIRST THING WE SHOULD SAY IS
THAT AN


532
0:37:47,97 --> 0:37:55,45
ESSENTIAL MINERAL OR PROBABLY THE BEST WORD
IS


533
0:37:55,45 --> 0:38:7,7
ELEMENT, AS YOU WILL SEE IN THE CHEMICAL SENSE.
 ESSENTIAL ELEMENT, WHEN TOTALLY ABSENT WILL


534
0:38:7,7 --> 0:38:8,89
PREVENT A


535
0:38:8,89 --> 0:38:28,49
PLANT FROM COMPLETING ITS LIFE CYCLE. BUT,
IT IS VERY


536
0:38:28,49 --> 0:38:31,74
RARE THAT AN ELEMENT IS TOTALLY ABSENT. IT
USUALLY IS


537
0:38:31,74 --> 0:38:35,349
PRESENT IN SUBOPTIMAL AMOUNTS. AND THE SUBOPTIMAL


538
0:38:35,349 --> 0:38:38,51
AMOUNT ALLOWS THE PLANT TO GROW BUT THE PLANT
LOOKS


539
0:38:38,51 --> 0:38:49,73
SICK. SO SUBOPTIMAL AMOUNTS


540
0:38:49,73 --> 0:38:52,23
RESULT IN WHAT WE KNOW OF


541
0:38:52,23 --> 0:38:59,579
AS DEFICIENCY DISEASES.


542
0:38:59,579 --> 0:39:0,859
AND THIS IS THE MOST COMMON


543
0:39:0,859 --> 0:39:3,549
SORTS OF THINGS THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR DORM
PLANTS.


544
0:39:3,549 --> 0:39:7,42
THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IS NOT TOTALLY ABSENT
BUT IT IS


545
0:39:7,42 --> 0:39:10,19
PRESENT IN SUBOPTIMAL AMOUNTS AND THE PLANT
JUST CAN'T


546
0:39:10,19 --> 0:39:12,99
MANAGE THAT WELL. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THESE


547
0:39:12,99 --> 0:39:16,0
ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS OR MINERALS ARE. THERE
AREN'T


548
0:39:16,0 --> 0:39:20,65
THAT MANY, SURPRISINGLY. BUT THEY ARE PROBABLY
BEST


549
0:39:20,65 --> 0:39:24,2
APPROACHED BY ASKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT IN WHICH
THEY


550
0:39:24,2 --> 0:39:28,69
ARE NEEDED. BIOLOGISTS, AND A LOT OF THIS
WORK IN


551
0:39:28,69 --> 0:39:30,109
DESCRIBING AND FINDING OUT WHAT THESE ESSENTIAL


552
0:39:30,109 --> 0:39:33,88
ELEMENTS WERE OR ARE WAS DONE HERE AT BERKELEY
IN THE


553
0:39:33,88 --> 0:39:40,92
30'S AND THE 40'S AND ALSO AT DAVIS BY A MAN
 NAMED HOAGLAND. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ESSENTIAL


554
0:39:40,92 --> 0:39:46,869
ELEMENTS. THEY ARE USUALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO
GROUPS.


555
0:39:46,869 --> 0:39:57,51
THOSE THAT ARE NEEDED IN LARGE AMOUNTS, SUCH
AS 1 TO 4


556
0:39:57,51 --> 0:40:8,4
PERCENT OF THE DRY WEIGHT OF A PLANT. AND
THESE THAT


557
0:40:8,4 --> 0:40:11,339
ARE NEEDED IN SUCH LARGE AMOUNTS ARE KNOWN
AS MACRO


558
0:40:11,339 --> 0:40:16,98
NUTRIENTS.


559
0:40:16,98 --> 0:40:23,71
AND THIS IS CONTRASTED WITH THOSE NEEDED


560
0:40:23,71 --> 0:40:29,23
IN SMALL AMOUNTS. OFTEN THE AMOUNTS ARE VANISHINGLY


561
0:40:29,23 --> 0:40:32,17
SMALL, TINY, TINY AMOUNTS. AND THESE ARE KNOWN
AS


562
0:40:32,17 --> 0:40:39,48
MICRONUTRIENTS.


563
0:40:39,48 --> 0:40:41,849
IN GENERAL, THE MICRONUTRIENTS ARE


564
0:40:41,849 --> 0:40:48,509
ELEMENTS WHICH ARE INVOLVED AS COFACTORS,
COFACTORS ON


565
0:40:48,509 --> 0:40:51,559
MANY ENZYMATIC CREATIONS SOMETIMES INVOLVED
IN


566
0:40:51,559 --> 0:40:58,4
ELECTRON TRANSPORT.


567
0:40:58,4 --> 0:40:59,39
SO THEY ARE NEEDED IN TINY


568
0:40:59,39 --> 0:41:2,47
AMOUNTS BECAUSE THEY ARE RECYCLED, REUSED
OVER AND


569
0:41:2,47 --> 0:41:8,49
OVER AGAIN. LET'S TALK NOW ABOUT WHAT THESE
TWO


570
0:41:8,49 --> 0:41:11,59
CLASSES INCLUDE. AND LET'S FIRST LOOK AT THE
MACRO


571
0:41:11,59 --> 0:41:14,99
NUTRIENTS AND WHAT ELEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED
TO BE NEEDS


572
0:41:14,99 --> 0:41:21,48
IN VERY LARGE AMOUNTS. ASIDE FROM CARBON,
HYDROGEN


573
0:41:21,48 --> 0:41:24,45
AND OXYGEN, WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY NEEDED FOR
ALL LIVING


574
0:41:24,45 --> 0:41:33,89
 SYSTEMS, WE NEED PHOSPHORUS, POTASSIUM,
NITROGEN,


575
0:41:33,89 --> 0:41:43,19
SULFUR, CALCIUM, IRON AND MAGNESIUM. THESE
ARE THE


576
0:41:43,19 --> 0:41:50,73
MACRO NUTRIENTS. THEY ARE NEEDED IN HIGH AMOUNTS.


577
0:41:50,73 --> 0:41:53,4
AND AN EASY WAY OF REMEMBERING THIS, IF YOU
WANT TO


578
0:41:53,4 --> 0:41:57,779
REMEMBER IT, IS "SEE HOPKIN'S CAFE MANAGER"
SEE


579
0:41:57,779 --> 0:42:0,68
HOPKIN'S CAFE MANAGER. THESE ARE THE MACRO
NUTRIENTS.


580
0:42:0,68 --> 0:42:3,99
THIS IS AS OPPOSED TO THE MICRONUTRIENTS WHICH


581
0:42:3,99 --> 0:42:15,42
INCLUDE; COPPER, ZINC, MOLYBDENUM, BORON,
CHLORIDE.


582
0:42:15,42 --> 0:42:18,96
THESE ARE GENERALLY NEEDED IN TINY, TINY AMOUNTS.
AND


583
0:42:18,96 --> 0:42:22,109
IN SOME PLANTS, AS THE EXAMPLE I HAVE UP HERE,
THERE


584
0:42:22,109 --> 0:42:24,789
ARE SOMETIMES OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH ARE NEEDED


585
0:42:24,789 --> 0:42:28,14
SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PLANT. FOR EXAMPLE,
SOME PLANTS


586
0:42:28,14 --> 0:42:34,46
NEED SILICA OR SILICON. AND THIS IS A GOOD
EXAMPLE UP


587
0:42:34,46 --> 0:42:37,2
HERE OF A PLANT THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN
IN THE LAB.


588
0:42:37,2 --> 0:42:40,92
THIS IS EQUISETUM OR SCOURING REED. AND THE
REASON IT


589
0:42:40,92 --> 0:42:44,17
FEELS SO GRITTY IS BECAUSE IT HAS INCLUDED
SILICA IN


590
0:42:44,17 --> 0:42:47,21
ITS CELL WALLS. SO SILICA IS NECESSARY FOR
THIS


591
0:42:47,21 --> 0:42:50,4
PLANT. BUT IN GENERAL IT IS NOT A NUTRIENT
NEEDED BY


592
0:42:50,4 --> 0:42:55,41
 MOST PLANTS. NOW, THESE MACRO/MICRONUTRIENTS,
AS I


593
0:42:55,41 --> 0:42:57,97
SAID, ARE NEEDED FOR A PLANT TO COMPLETE ITS
LIFE


594
0:42:57,97 --> 0:43:3,9
CYCLE. IF YOU HAVE A PLANT YOU'RE WONDERING,
WHAT


595
0:43:3,9 --> 0:43:7,63
ELEMENT IS MISSING FROM ITS REGIME? WHY IS
THIS


596
0:43:7,63 --> 0:43:10,19
PLANT SUFFERING FROM A DEFICIENCY OR IS IT


597
0:43:10,19 --> 0:43:12,349
SUFFICIENTING FROM A DEFICIENCY DISEASE? WHAT
YOU


598
0:43:12,349 --> 0:43:14,93
WANT TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR PLANT AND
ASK


599
0:43:14,93 --> 0:43:18,329
YOURSELF ARE THE YOUNGEST LEAVES IN BAD SHAPE
OR ARE


600
0:43:18,329 --> 0:43:20,93
THE OLDEST LEAVES IN BAD SHAPE? SO LET'S TAKE
A LOOK


601
0:43:20,93 --> 0:43:24,42
AT A PLANT, WHICH IS GROWING IN A POT HERE,
AND LET'S


602
0:43:24,42 --> 0:43:28,99
JUST SAY WHEN YOU BOUGHT THE PLANT YOU HAD
ONE SET OF


603
0:43:28,99 --> 0:43:31,42
LEAVES ON THE PLANT. SO, WE WILL JUST CALL
THESE


604
0:43:31,42 --> 0:43:36,2
LEAVES 1. NOW YOU HAVE LET THE PLANT GO FOR
SOME TIME


605
0:43:36,2 --> 0:43:42,69
AND NOW YOU HAVE TWO SETS OF LEAVES ON THE
PLANT.


606
0:43:42,69 --> 0:43:44,17
HERE IS THE LEAF 1. THEY ARE THE SAME LEAVES
THAT


607
0:43:44,17 --> 0:43:47,47
WERE PRESENT WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT. NOW WE HAVE
LEAF 2'S


608
0:43:47,47 --> 0:43:50,69
WHICH HAVE BEEN PRODUCED SINCE YOU HAD THE
PLANT. AND


609
0:43:50,69 --> 0:43:53,4
NOW LET'S LET THE PLANT GROW A LITTLE BIT
LONGER. AND


610
0:43:53,4 --> 0:44:0,49
 NOW WE HAVE 3 SETS OF LEAVES.


611
0:44:0,49 --> 0:44:1,75
HERE IS OUR FIRST THING


612
0:44:1,75 --> 0:44:3,769
WHICH WAS PRESENT WHEN YOU BOUGHT THE PLANT.
THE


613
0:44:3,769 --> 0:44:7,339
SECOND AND THEN THE THIRD, WHICH WERE PRODUCED
WHEN


614
0:44:7,339 --> 0:44:11,289
YOU HAD THE PLANT IN YOUR DORM ROOM. NOW,
IF YOU HAVE


615
0:44:11,289 --> 0:44:14,269
A PLANT IN YOUR DORM ROOM AND IT IS NOT LOOKING
GOOD


616
0:44:14,269 --> 0:44:17,0
THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO ASK YOURSELF IS;
WHICH


617
0:44:17,0 --> 0:44:22,4
LEAVES LOOK THE WORST? DO THE OLDER LEAVES
LOOK BAD


618
0:44:22,4 --> 0:44:26,339
OR DO THE NEWER LEAVES LOOK BAD? AND BY DECIDING


619
0:44:26,339 --> 0:44:29,869
WHICH LEAF LOOKS BAD YOU CAN BEGIN TO NARROW
DOWN


620
0:44:29,869 --> 0:44:33,859
WHICH NUTRIENT OR WHICH MINERAL MIGHT BE MISSING
FROM


621
0:44:33,859 --> 0:44:37,349
THE SOIL. NOW, HOW IS THAT USEFUL? AND HOW
IS THAT


622
0:44:37,349 --> 0:44:40,359
EXPLAINED? IT IS EXPLAINED IN THE FOLLOWING


623
0:44:40,359 --> 0:44:43,23
WAY; LET'S SAY YOU HAD A NUTRIENT AND THIS


624
0:44:43,23 --> 0:44:45,95
NUTRIENT RAN OUT OF THE SOIL. IT WAS PRESENT
IN THE


625
0:44:45,95 --> 0:44:49,609
BEGINNING AND AS THE PLANT GREW THE NEWER
LEAVES


626
0:44:49,609 --> 0:44:53,73
STARTED LOOKING BAD. WHAT WE CAN CONCLUDE
THEN IS


627
0:44:53,73 --> 0:44:56,99
THAT THAT NUTRIENT THAT YOU PROVIDED THE PLANT
ONCE IT


628
0:44:56,99 --> 0:45:0,95
IS USED BY THE PLANT IT IS ESSENTIALLY TRAPPED
IN THE


629
0:45:0,95 --> 0:45:6,799
 SPACE THAT IT IS USED. IT IS IMMOBILE. IT
IS TRAPPED


630
0:45:6,799 --> 0:45:9,97
IN THE PLACE THAT IT WAS USED. THEREFORE,
AS THE


631
0:45:9,97 --> 0:45:13,789
PLANT CONTINUES TO GROW AND THE NUTRIENT IS
EXHAUSTED


632
0:45:13,789 --> 0:45:17,89
FROM THE SOIL THAT ELEMENT CAN'T MOVE. IT
IS TRAPPED


633
0:45:17,89 --> 0:45:20,71
WHERE IT WAS FIRST PUT. AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE
OF


634
0:45:20,71 --> 0:45:23,599
CALCIUM. FOR EXAMPLE, ONCE CALCIUM IS USED
BY THE


635
0:45:23,599 --> 0:45:27,39
PLANT IT CAN'T BE MOVED. THIS IS AS OPPOSED
TO


636
0:45:27,39 --> 0:45:31,2
A SITUATION WHERE YOUR PLANT WITH TREE LEAVES,
IF YOU


637
0:45:31,2 --> 0:45:35,46
LOOK AT IT, NOW THE OLDER LEAVES LOOK BAD.
AND THE


638
0:45:35,46 --> 0:45:37,95
NEWER LEAVES LOOK JUST GREAT OR THEY LOOK
BETTER THAN


639
0:45:37,95 --> 0:45:41,549
THE ONES ON THE BOTTOM. IN THIS PARTICULAR
CASE WHAT


640
0:45:41,549 --> 0:45:45,48
THIS IS TELLING YOU IS THAT THIS NUTRIENT
IS MOBILE.


641
0:45:45,48 --> 0:45:51,65
IT IS ABLE TO MOVE FROM THE LEAVES THAT IT
WAS IN


642
0:45:51,65 --> 0:45:57,529
ORIGINALLY TO NEWER LEAVES. IT IS MOBILE.
SO, IN THE


643
0:45:57,529 --> 0:46:10,92
MOBILE CASE THE NEWER LEAVES LOOK BEST.


644
0:46:10,92 --> 0:46:11,39
AND FINALLY


645
0:46:11,39 --> 0:46:14,2
BEFORE I SHOW YOU SOME SLIDES, I WANTED TO
MENTION TO


646
0:46:14,2 --> 0:46:18,29
YOU THAT VERY OFTEN IF YOU GO TO THE STORE


647
0:46:18,29 --> 0:46:21,799
TO BUY FERTILIZER FOR PLANTS YOU WILL FIND
A NUMBER


648
0:46:21,799 --> 0:46:24,869
 WRITTEN ON THE FERTILIZER PACKAGE. THE NUMBER
MIGHT


649
0:46:24,869 --> 0:46:35,339
BE 16, 12, 8 OR IT COULD BE 3, 9, 16. THESE
ARE CODES


650
0:46:35,339 --> 0:46:38,38
NOT FOR THE NURSERY TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN
THEMSELVES


651
0:46:38,38 --> 0:46:42,79
BUT TO TELL YOU WHAT THE RATIO OF CERTAIN
MACRO


652
0:46:42,79 --> 0:46:45,589
NUTRIENTS ARE IN THE FERTILIZER THAT YOU ARE
BUYING.


653
0:46:45,589 --> 0:46:49,23
SO, THESE STAND FOR POTASSIUM, PHOSPHORUS
AND


654
0:46:49,23 --> 0:46:52,579
NITROGEN. THEIR CONCENTRATION IN THE FERTILIZERS.


655
0:46:52,579 --> 0:46:56,89
AND THIS WILL BE AN INDICATION BECAUSE CERTAIN


656
0:46:56,89 --> 0:46:59,15
FERTILIZERS YOU BUY FOR CERTAIN PLANTS DEPENDING
UPON


657
0:46:59,15 --> 0:47:2,349
THE RATIO OF THESE MACRO NUTRIENTS. LET ME
SHOW YOU


658
0:47:2,349 --> 0:47:6,14
NOW SOME SLIDES TO ILLUSTRATE TO YOU THESE
VARIOUS


659
0:47:6,14 --> 0:47:8,869
MINERAL DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS. THIS IS THE WAY
THESE


660
0:47:8,869 --> 0:47:11,44
EXPERIMENTS ARE RUN. AND YOU ARE GOING TO
DO THIS IN


661
0:47:11,44 --> 0:47:13,349
LAB THE WEEK AFTER NEXT. YOU ARE GOING TO
HAVE


662
0:47:13,349 --> 0:47:16,809
A SERIES OF JARS AND INTO THESE JARS NUTRIENTS
ARE


663
0:47:16,809 --> 0:47:19,849
EITHER ADDED OR THE PLANT IS GROWN IN THE
JAR WITH


664
0:47:19,849 --> 0:47:22,74
A NUTRIENT LACKING. HERE IS THE CONTROL PLANT
OVER


665
0:47:22,74 --> 0:47:28,249
HERE IN A COMPLETE SOLUTION OF MICRO AND MACRO
 NUTRIENTS AND THEN WE HAVE DIFFERENT NUTRIENTS


666
0:47:28,249 --> 0:47:28,41
WHICH


667
0:47:28,41 --> 0:47:32,109
ARE MISSING AS WE GO FURTHER DOWN. HERE IS
AN EXAMPLE


668
0:47:32,109 --> 0:47:35,74
OF MINUS POTASSIUM, WHEN POTASSIUM RUNS OUT.
NOTICE


669
0:47:35,74 --> 0:47:40,16
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THAT IT IS THE NEWEST
LEAVES


670
0:47:40,16 --> 0:47:43,15
WHICH LOOK GREAT. SO THIS MEANS THAT THIS
NUTRIENT


671
0:47:43,15 --> 0:47:45,95
WHEN IT RAN OUT WAS A MOBILE NUTRIENT. IT
WAS MOVED


672
0:47:45,95 --> 0:47:49,349
UP FROM THE OLDER LEAVES UP TO THE TOP OF
THE PLANT.


673
0:47:49,349 --> 0:47:52,549
HERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A NUTRIENT WHICH
IS MOBILE,


674
0:47:52,549 --> 0:47:55,19
MAGNESIUM. IT IS MOVED IN THE OLDEST LEAVES,
WHICH


675
0:47:55,19 --> 0:47:59,9
LOOK BAD, UP TO THE NEWEST LEAVES ON THE TOP.
HERE


676
0:47:59,9 --> 0:48:2,67
ARE NOW PLANTS LACKING CALCIUM. IN THIS PARTICULAR


677
0:48:2,67 --> 0:48:5,99
CASE WE SAID CALCIUM WAS NOT MOBILE, IT IS
IMMOBILE.


678
0:48:5,99 --> 0:48:8,29
SO, THE OLDER LEAVES, THEY DON'T LOOK GREAT
BUT THEY


679
0:48:8,29 --> 0:48:10,94
AT LEAST ARE GREEN. WHEREAS, THE NEWER LEAVES
ARE THE


680
0:48:10,94 --> 0:48:14,99
ONES WHICH SHOW THE EFFECTS FIRST. SO, LOOK
AT YOUR


681
0:48:14,99 --> 0:48:16,839
PLANTS IN THAT WAY. HERE ARE PLANTS NOW WHICH
ARE


682
0:48:16,839 --> 0:48:20,13
MINUS IRON. IRON IS A FUNNY NUTRIENT. IT IS
SAID TO


683
0:48:20,13 --> 0:48:24,289
BE SEMI-MOBILE. SO THAT IF YOU LOOK AT A PLANT
 SUFFERING IRON DEFICIENCY, AND THIS IS A


684
0:48:24,289 --> 0:48:24,9
VERY COMMON


685
0:48:24,9 --> 0:48:27,98
TRAIT HERE IN CALIFORNIA, THE VEIN IS GREEN
BUT THE


686
0:48:27,98 --> 0:48:32,329
BLADE ITSELF IS WHITE. NOW HERE IS SOME PROBLEMS
THAT


687
0:48:32,329 --> 0:48:35,68
FARMERS HAVE. IF YOU GROW TOMATOES AND THE
SOIL IS


688
0:48:35,68 --> 0:48:38,999
LOW IN COPPER OR ZINC, THESE TWO MICRONUTRIENTS,
YOU


689
0:48:38,999 --> 0:48:41,66
GREATLY AFFECT THE FORM OF THE PLANT. HERE
IS


690
0:48:41,66 --> 0:48:45,599
BROCCOLI. BROCCOLI GROWN IN SOIL WHICH IS
LACKING OR


691
0:48:45,599 --> 0:48:48,329
VERY LOW IN MOLYBDENUM DOES NOT PRODUCE THE
BROCCOLI


692
0:48:48,329 --> 0:48:51,71
FLOWERS AND IT IS SO CALLED WHIP TAIL BROCCOLI.
HERE


693
0:48:51,71 --> 0:48:55,859
ARE PEAS NOW WHICH ARE GROWN IN SOIL WITH
A TOO LOW OF


694
0:48:55,859 --> 0:48:58,93
LEVEL OF COPPER. REMEMBER COPPER IS A MICRONUTRIENT.


695
0:48:58,93 --> 0:49:3,19
AND IN THIS CASE THE OVULES FAIL TO DEVELOP.
HERE ARE


696
0:49:3,19 --> 0:49:6,16
CARNATIONS NOW GROWN MINUS BORON. THIS IS
A BIG


697
0:49:6,16 --> 0:49:8,19
PROBLEM FOR CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE WE GROW A
LOT OF


698
0:49:8,19 --> 0:49:10,819
CARNATIONS. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU
HAVE


699
0:49:10,819 --> 0:49:14,45
ENOUGH BORON OR IN THE MEDIUM. HERE ARE APPLES
GROWN


700
0:49:14,45 --> 0:49:17,48
IN A BORON FREE MEDIUM IN WHICH CASE YOU CAN
SEE THE


701
0:49:17,48 --> 0:49:20,96
APPLES ALSO ARE NOT PARTICULARLY GREAT SHAPE.
GRAPES


702
0:49:20,96 --> 0:49:24,539
 MINUS BORON, YOU CAN AFFECT THEM. SO, WHAT
I WANT TO


703
0:49:24,539 --> 0:49:28,89
POINT OUT TO YOU IS THAT WE HAVE THESE VARIOUS


704
0:49:28,89 --> 0:49:31,279
DEFICIENCY DISEASES. THEY CAN EASILY BE LOOKED
AT


705
0:49:31,279 --> 0:49:35,23
DEPENDING UPON HOW YOU ANALYZE THE TISSUE.
NOW,


706
0:49:35,23 --> 0:49:37,97
FINALLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU ABOUT THE
EXAM IS


707
0:49:37,97 --> 0:49:43,509
THAT THE MIDTERM HAS 35 QUESTIONS ON IT. SO,
MOST OF


708
0:49:43,509 --> 0:49:46,69
THEM ARE WORTH 3 POINTS. THERE ARE 2 POINTS
EACH.


709
0:49:46,69 --> 0:49:47,859
AND I WANT TO JUST TELL YOU THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
THE


710
0:49:47,859 --> 0:49:49,72
STUDENTS MAKE ABOUT THE QUESTIONS. I HAVE
ALREADY


711
0:49:49,72 --> 0:49:51,94
ENCOUNTERED THIS IN TALKING TO SOME OF YOU
ABOUT THE


712
0:49:51,94 --> 0:49:55,519
SAMPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE POSTED ON THE
WEB PAGE.


713
0:49:55,519 --> 0:49:57,98
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE YOU MAKE IS NUMBER 1,
YOU DON'T


714
0:49:57,98 --> 0:50:0,779
READ ALL OF THE ANSWERS FIRST. WE ASK YOU
CHOOSE THE


715
0:50:0,779 --> 0:50:4,289
BEST ANSWER. NOT THE ANSWER WHICH CONTAINS
SOME


716
0:50:4,289 --> 0:50:7,79
CORRECT INFORMATION, BUT THE ANSWER WHICH
CONTAINS ALL


717
0:50:7,79 --> 0:50:9,509
OF THE CORRECT INFORMATION. SO, READ ALL OF
THE


718
0:50:9,509 --> 0:50:13,119
ANSWERS FIRST. SECONDLY, THE OTHER MISTAKE
YOU MAKE


719
0:50:13,119 --> 0:50:16,529
AND IT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR, IS YOU READ TOO
MUCH INTO


720
0:50:16,529 --> 0:50:20,319
 THE QUESTION. IF THE QUESTION SAYS; IT IS
A SEED WITH


721
0:50:20,319 --> 0:50:24,9
A POORLY DEVELOPED EMBRYO, YOU KNOW THAT IT
HAS A SEED


722
0:50:24,9 --> 0:50:27,339
COAT. YOU KNOW THAT DOUBLE FERTILIZATION OCCURRED.


723
0:50:27,339 --> 0:50:29,69
DON'T EXPECT TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS


724
0:50:29,69 --> 0:50:32,17
PARTHENOCARPIC OR WHETHER THERE IS SOMETHING
WHICH HAS


725
0:50:32,17 --> 0:50:34,369
HAPPENED TO VIVIPARY. THAT IS NOT STATED IN
THE


726
0:50:34,369 --> 0:50:37,619
QUESTION. ONLY READ WHAT IS IN THE QUESTION.
DON'T


727
0:50:37,619 --> 0:50:40,359
ADD MORE TO THE QUESTION. DON'T READ MORE
INTO THE


728
0:50:40,359 --> 0:50:42,269
QUESTION BECAUSE IF YOU DO, YOU WILL MAKE
IT HARDER


729
0:50:42,269 --> 0:50:44,499
FOR YOURSELF. I THINK THAT THE QUESTIONS ARE
PRETTY


730
0:50:44,499 --> 0:50:46,529
STRAIGHTFORWARD. AND I THINK THAT IF YOU


731
0:50:46,529 --> 0:50:50,79
UNDERSTAND ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS, IF
YOU ARE ABLE


732
0:50:50,79 --> 0:50:53,69
TO UNDERSTAND THE LIFE CYCLE PRETTY WELL,
HOW THE


733
0:50:53,69 --> 0:50:56,49
ENDODERMIS WORKS, YOU SHOULD DO PRETTY WELL
ON THIS


734
0:50:56,49 --> 0:50:59,91
EXAM. SECONDARY AND PRIMARY GROWTH ARE THE
OTHER


735
0:50:59,91 --> 0:51:2,319
FEATURES WE WILL STRESS. SO, WHAT I WANT YOU
TO DO IS


736
0:51:2,319 --> 0:51:7,2
TO COME TO THE REVIEW SESSION. ARE THEIR QUESTIONS


737
0:51:7,2 --> 0:51:10,309
DECIDED TO TRICK YOU? NOT INTENTIONALLY. I
WANT YOU


738
0:51:10,309 --> 0:51:12,92
 TO KNOW THAT. OKAY. SO I WILL SEE YOU GUYS
ALL ON


739
0:51:12,92 --> 0:53:12,92
TUESDAY NIGHT.
