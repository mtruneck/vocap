###25 THOMAS MORTON: Hi, it's Thomas.
###26 We're in Ghana, the internet capital of Africa.
###29 If you ever wonder what happens to computers that you
###31 donate to one of those green e-recycling programs, this is
###35 basically it.
###37 Kids from the north of Ghana come to this junkyard during
###39 the summer to break computers down for scrap and also inhale
###43 things that will probably end up giving them cancer of the
###45 everything.
###47 
###48 
###57 THOMAS MORTON: Most of the computers are only worth the
###59 dollar or two of copper you can melt out of them.
###61 But occasionally you harvest something useful, like a hard
###64 drive or a processor, which you can sell at the little
###66 flea market area next to the charnel grounds.
###71 THOMAS MORTON: Ah, OK.
###72 If you're an especially savvy shopper, you can actually put
###75 together a full working computer here, one ready to
###78 connect you to the fastest internet in all of Africa.
###80 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###87 THOMAS MORTON: Ghana puts a lot of stock in computers.
###89 Their internet is directly linked to Great Britain's, and
###91 they are billboards all over the capital, extolling the
###93 virtues of personal computing.
###95 Ghana already is sort of the top dog of West Africa, where
###99 most of its neighbors have been plagued by war and
###101 poverty since independence, Ghana's had almost 50 years of
###104 stability and growth.
###105 Right now they're hoping foreign investment will
###106 bolster a computer industry here, which will permanently
###109 make them the tech capital of West Africa.
###112 So far it hasn't quite materialized, but what has
###114 materialized is a thriving underground economy of fraud
###117 and witchcraft called Sakawa.
###121 
###153 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###161 
###191 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###198 THOMAS MORTON: Sakawa dates back to Nigeria's oil boom in
###200 the late '70s.
###202 Ghanaians came into the country to take jobs in the
###204 oil fields, and the locals taught them their favorite
###206 pastime, the pen-pal scam.
###209 The way it works is you write to someone in America or
###210 England, tell them about an investment opportunity you
###213 have, or just straight up ask them for money, and they send
###216 it to you, and that's it-- scam over.
###218 Eventually the Nigerian government deported all the
###220 Ghanaian guest workers back home, and they brought the
###222 pen-pal scam with them.
###223 Then they combined it with magic.
###227 
###255 THOMAS MORTON: As the internet took hold in Ghana, the
###256 pen-pal scam was adapted to email.
###258 Then scammers started hooking up with hackers online and
###260 incorporating things like credit card fraud into their
###262 scams, which became
###263 increasingly complex and lucrative.
###266 We kind of like the idea of making a living off the back
###269 American stupidity, so we hooked up with a Sakawa gang,
###272 led by a young Ghanaian named Sefa.
###275 
###288 THOMAS MORTON: And now the term just gets used--
###290 THOMAS MORTON: --for everything.
###291 
###310 THOMAS MORTON: Sefa's a Sakawa success story.
###313 He's used his old scam earnings to pay for business
###315 school and has made a nice living for himself by Ghanaian
###317 standards, although he still has to cross a stream of urine
###321 every night to get into his house.
###324 Sakawa comprises any number of online scams, but the majority
###328 boil down to two basic types.
###330 One, you pretend you're a sexy girl, convince someone to fall
###332 in love with you, and then they send you money.
###333 This is called the romance scam.
###336 The other one is, you use a stolen or forged credit card
###338 number to buy something online.
###339 Then you have it shipped to someone in the West who sends
###341 you money for it.
###342 That one's called the shopping scam.
###345 These two scams sort of work like templates.
###347 Once you nail down the basics of them, you can start
###350 combining them and adding all sorts of personalized details
###352 until your mark feels like he's in the middle of some
###354 elaborate international business scheme and not just
###357 emailing back and forth with an African kid on a laptop.
###361 The thing with Sakawa is while it's essentially free money,
###363 it isn't easy money.
###365 To find someone gullible enough to fall for your
###367 shtick, you have to spend hours and hours emailing
###369 hundreds and thousands of random addresses.
###372 
###411 THOMAS MORTON: In America, frustrated gamblers will kiss
###413 a lucky penny or pray to Saint Bernardino for help.
###417 Likewise, frustrated Sakawa boys turn to religion when
###419 they're down on their luck.
###421 Only in their case, turning to religion means driving out
###424 into the bush and paying a juju priest
###426 for magic email powers.
###429 [DRUMMING]
###448 THOMAS MORTON: I'm definitely in Africa right now.
###450 
###453 Juju is the local term for what fancy anthropology types
###456 call traditional African religion.
###459 In the same way that Hinduism is actually more or less a
###462 collection of thousands of local deities and rituals,
###465 juju is basically an umbrella for any West African religious
###467 practice that isn't obviously Christianity or Islam--
###471 or Scientology.
###473 One aspect central to all forms of juju is that the
###475 spirit world is morally neutral.
###478 As in the gods don't give a shit what you and I do to each
###480 other as long as they get paid.
###483 This makes juju perfect for Sakawa.
###485 If you want a leg up on the competition, you get a juju
###487 priest to barter with the spirits, and then they give
###489 you powers.
###492 So the point of the juju ceremony we're dancing in
###494 isn't to win converts or teach some sort of a
###496 lesson like in church.
###498 It's to demonstrate the priests ins with the spirit
###500 world and advertise his powers.
###502 Powers like channeling a god who can't be cut by knifes.
###506 Or channeling another god, who likes throwing eggs.
###508 
###515 Why is he throwing eggs?
###519 THOMAS MORTON: Why, why does he throw them?
###522 THOMAS MORTON: Oh.
###524 
###531 Waste of powers.
###534 The flip side to all this is once you make a deal with the
###536 gods, you're bound to their terms.
###538 If you piss them off or default on payment to your
###540 juju priest, you end up with the opposite of powers, like
###543 bad luck or AIDS.
###547 On top of that the payment process itself
###549 can be pretty tricky.
###551 
###580 THOMAS MORTON: Westerners may find stuff like magic eggs and
###582 tampon eating a little hard to swallow, but it's serious
###585 business over here.
###586 And not just with like superstitious bumpkins.
###588 Even educated, cosmopolitan folks like
###590 Sefa believe in this.
###592 
###611 THOMAS MORTON: Besides, is of any of this really that much
###613 weirder than shit like communion or circumcisions?
###616 [CRYING]
###625 
###632 THOMAS MORTON: That part was a little rough.
###634 
###640 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###644 THOMAS MORTON: While Sakawa originally referred to a very
###646 specific type of internet fraud mixed with juju, then it
###649 went on to mean any internet crime involving witchcraft,
###652 and now it's kind of evolved into its own full-blown
###654 subculture.
###656 So there's Sakawa music, Sakawa movies, Sakawa cars, a
###659 Sakawa style of dressing.
###661 
###672 
###685 THOMAS MORTON: Right now Ghana's in the throes of
###686 Sakawa mania.
###687 It's in all the papers and movie theaters.
###689 It's bigger than rap.
###690 
###693 I'm looking for Sakawa movies.
###697 Oh, cool, here's number three.
###699 If you want a glimpse at just how deeply Sakawa's penetrated
###701 the public consciousness, check this out.
###703 They're already up to "Sakawa Boys 8," and the series just
###706 started last year.
###707 
###712 We're on our way to meet a guy who makes films about Sakawa.
###716 His name is Socrate Safo.
###717 He's actually like the Martin Scorsese of Ghanaian internet,
###722 fraud-based, gangster films.
###725 The Ghanaian film industry, or Ghallywood, operates on kind
###728 of a "more is more" principle of movie making.
###731 They crank out hundreds of titles a year, most of them
###733 shot on zero budget in as quickly as a couple weeks from
###736 start to finish.
###738 This speed doesn't do much for production values, but it does
###740 allow them to respond to current events and to cater
###742 their subject matter to their countrymen's exact interest.
###746 
###760 
###781 THOMAS MORTON: Realistic.
###782 Things drawn from real life.
###784 
###787 
###822 
###838 
###847 
###856 
###883 -Ain't you got nothing better to do?
###886 You asked for it.
###887 
###890 [LAUGHTER]
###894 THOMAS MORTON: Socrate's movie touched a nerve in national
###896 psyche and brought the issue of Sakawa to life for a lot of
###899 Ghanaians who otherwise wouldn't have heard of it.
###901 
###935 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###941 THOMAS MORTON: Since being thrust into the mainstream,
###943 though, Sakawa has drawn a huge outcry from government
###945 officials, tabloids, and Christian preachers, whose
###949 billboards in Accra are almost as ubiquitous as ads for
###951 computer classes and juju priests.
###953 
###956 
###989 THOMAS MORTON: While the furor over Sakawa dominates the
###991 tabloids and pulpits, the focus is all on black magic
###994 and blood debts and Sakawa boys turning each other into
###996 goats and snakes.
###998 None of it tackles the root of the problem, the fact that
###1000 over a third of young Ghanaians are unemployed, and
###1002 what jobs there are are filled by corrupt government
###1004 officials and their cousins.
###1005 
###1019 
###1035 THOMAS MORTON: Up until now the government's been more
###1037 than happy to turn a blind eye to Sakawa since it's basically
###1040 providing regular work for people that they can't.
###1043 There are also persistent rumors that Sakawa isn't just
###1045 limited to gangs of teenage delinquents, but is actually a
###1048 popular sideline among policemen, soldiers and
###1050 politicians.
###1052 
###1070 THOMAS MORTON: Now that's Sakawa's threatening Ghana's
###1071 business reputation, the government's cracking down.
###1074 And them and the press have started a moral panic over it.
###1077 Just like gangsta rappers in the early '90s, Sakawa boys
###1079 have gone from objects of sort of cultural fascination to
###1083 scapegoats for all their country's ills.
###1085 
###1105 
###1132 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1134 
###1182 THOMAS MORTON: The end of Sakawa may not necessarily
###1184 bring juju Armageddon to Ghana, but it will leave a
###1186 bunch of angry young men without any source of steady
###1188 income, which is arguably even scarier.
###1194 On a lighter note, Ghana just discovered oil off its shore,
###1197 so maybe that'll solve all their problems.
###1199 [MUSIC PLAYING]
