0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:6,59



2
0:0:6,59 --> 0:0:8,8
BETH HOYT: All right, Olga Kay
and I are here at the YouTube


3
0:0:8,8 --> 0:0:11,17
space in beautiful Playa
Del Rey, the most


4
0:0:11,17 --> 0:0:12,72
beautiful Del Rey--


5
0:0:12,72 --> 0:0:14,21
oh, not counting Lana Del Rey.


6
0:0:14,21 --> 0:0:14,71
Don't tell her.


7
0:0:14,71 --> 0:0:16,46
OLGA KAY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


8
0:0:16,46 --> 0:0:17,99
That was me speaking Russian.


9
0:0:17,99 --> 0:0:20,72
Tonight is International Comedy
Night, presented by


10
0:0:20,72 --> 0:0:22,31
Comedy Gives Back.


11
0:0:22,31 --> 0:0:23,3
You're going to see--


12
0:0:23,3 --> 0:0:23,57
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]


13
0:0:23,57 --> 0:0:24,715
OLGA KAY: Yeah, yeah!


14
0:0:24,715 --> 0:0:26,536
BETH HOYT: All right, yeah.


15
0:0:26,536 --> 0:0:26,85
It's live.


16
0:0:26,85 --> 0:0:28,896
OLGA KAY: You're going to see
some of the best international


17
0:0:28,896 --> 0:0:31,79
stand-ups from all over
the United States.


18
0:0:31,79 --> 0:0:32,409
BETH HOYT: Oh my gosh, man.


19
0:0:32,409 --> 0:0:34,8
There is so much stuff going
on this whole week.


20
0:0:34,8 --> 0:0:36,285
People are ready to bust down
the doors to get involved.


21
0:0:36,285 --> 0:0:38,69
OLGA KAY: Yeah, I'm actually
scared, all right, because I


22
0:0:38,69 --> 0:0:41,5
called my mother back
in Russia just to


23
0:0:41,5 --> 0:0:42,59
be on the safe side.


24
0:0:42,59 --> 0:0:43,44
I'm just kidding.


25
0:0:43,44 --> 0:0:45,7
My mom doesn't have a phone.


26
0:0:45,7 --> 0:0:48,56
BETH HOYT: It's an international
joke.


27
0:0:48,56 --> 0:0:49,1
That's not all.


28
0:0:49,1 --> 0:0:50,86
Don't forget to check out all
of the live events at

0:0:50,86 --> 0:0:53,14

0:0:53,14 --> 0:0:55,38
I mean, it's all so funny,
I'm scared of it.


31
0:0:55,38 --> 0:0:56,47
We're very scared.


32
0:0:56,47 --> 0:0:58,4
OLGA KAY: It's terrible,
hilarious, and lots of


33
0:0:58,4 --> 0:0:59,17
frightening stuff.


34
0:0:59,17 --> 0:0:59,31
BETH HOYT: Right.


35
0:0:59,31 --> 0:1:1,68
Also, last night's comedy show,
it's been uploaded and


36
0:1:1,68 --> 0:1:5,45

Week page, so check that out.


37
0:1:5,45 --> 0:1:5,6
OLGA KAY: Yeah, please.

0:1:5,6 --> 0:1:8,23
And hey, don't forget that every
day, we have multiple


39
0:1:8,23 --> 0:1:9,87
Comedy Week videos

40
0:1:9,87 --> 0:1:12,6
So go check out videos

41
0:1:12,6 --> 0:1:13,41
Everywhere, Rhett and Link--


42
0:1:13,41 --> 0:1:16,86
I'm in it-- and the new video
from Tim and Eric, "Goatee,"


43
0:1:16,86 --> 0:1:19,99
which also can be seen on
youtube.com/comedyweek.


44
0:1:19,99 --> 0:1:22,12
BETH HOYT: Oh my god, we have
to get out of here and let


45
0:1:22,12 --> 0:1:22,56
this show happen.


46
0:1:22,56 --> 0:1:23,306
OLGA KAY: Yeah, you're right.


47
0:1:23,306 --> 0:1:24,62
I'm going to go first
all right?


48
0:1:24,62 --> 0:1:25,7
BETH HOYT: Yeah, OK.


49
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:28,39
Oh, she's showing off.


50
0:1:28,39 --> 0:1:29,59
I can do that, too.


51
0:1:29,59 --> 0:1:31,79
We're going to be right back
tomorrow, but right now it's


52
0:1:31,79 --> 0:1:33,805
time for our international
stand-up show.


53
0:1:33,805 --> 0:1:54,36



54
0:1:54,36 --> 0:1:58,44
ROVE MCMANUS: Thank you,
thank you very much.


55
0:1:58,44 --> 0:1:59,66
Thank you.


56
0:1:59,66 --> 0:2:2,59
Welcome to Comedy
Week on YouTube.


57
0:2:2,59 --> 0:2:6,47
How is everybody here in
the house tonight?


58
0:2:6,47 --> 0:2:9,5
Welcome, wherever you are
watching around the world.


59
0:2:9,5 --> 0:2:13,81
Thank you for pausing whatever
hilarious Psy video clip you


60
0:2:13,81 --> 0:2:16,13
had to put aside to
be here tonight.


61
0:2:16,13 --> 0:2:17,1
Thank you.


62
0:2:17,1 --> 0:2:20,5
We are live, so everybody in
the audience, please, watch


63
0:2:20,5 --> 0:2:20,81
yourselves.


64
0:2:20,81 --> 0:2:23,323
I know when it's live, you
go, they can't stop me.


65
0:2:23,323 --> 0:2:25,9
You just want to yell "titties"
or something, but


66
0:2:25,9 --> 0:2:27,1
rein it in.


67
0:2:27,1 --> 0:2:29,2
Grow up.


68
0:2:29,2 --> 0:2:29,78
I know it's YouTube.


69
0:2:29,78 --> 0:2:33,2
This is where we all first saw
the two girls and the one cup.


70
0:2:33,2 --> 0:2:37,97
But, at the same time, there's
a lot of innocent, overweight


71
0:2:37,97 --> 0:2:40,37
Japanese cats just trying
to jump in and out of


72
0:2:40,37 --> 0:2:43,61
their boxes in peace.


73
0:2:43,61 --> 0:2:45,78
Have some dignity.


74
0:2:45,78 --> 0:2:48,33
I am your host for this evening,
wherever you are


75
0:2:48,33 --> 0:2:49,55
watching this.


76
0:2:49,55 --> 0:2:51,13
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]


77
0:2:51,13 --> 0:2:52,38
ROVE MCMANUS: That's great.


78
0:2:52,38 --> 0:2:54,386



79
0:2:54,386 --> 0:2:59,0
Thank you, thank you.


80
0:2:59,0 --> 0:3:3,5
Thank you for pretending
to know who I am.


81
0:3:3,5 --> 0:3:4,12
That's very--


82
0:3:4,12 --> 0:3:6,46
yes, your laughter
gives you away.


83
0:3:6,46 --> 0:3:8,49
My name is Rove McManus.


84
0:3:8,49 --> 0:3:11,19
I am an Australian comedian
and talk show host.


85
0:3:11,19 --> 0:3:13,6
This is very exciting
for me to be here.


86
0:3:13,6 --> 0:3:15,72
For those of you who don't know
me, yes, Rove, I realize


87
0:3:15,72 --> 0:3:18,14
it's a bit of a weird name.


88
0:3:18,14 --> 0:3:22,225
At least I thought so 'til I
moved here to Los Angeles.


89
0:3:22,225 --> 0:3:24,49
Did you know there's a person
who lives in this city called


90
0:3:24,49 --> 0:3:26,11
Zooey Deschanel?


91
0:3:26,11 --> 0:3:29,2
That's the name of a person.


92
0:3:29,2 --> 0:3:30,46
I'm like, whooey with
the what now?


93
0:3:30,46 --> 0:3:33,24
That can't be a real
thing, surely.


94
0:3:33,24 --> 0:3:36,97
But what I've also discovered
is that, in this city


95
0:3:36,97 --> 0:3:39,46
especially, celebrities
love a crazy name.


96
0:3:39,46 --> 0:3:42,19
I fit right in here.


97
0:3:42,19 --> 0:3:45,42
Normally what happens is, the
celebrities, they'll pair up


98
0:3:45,42 --> 0:3:50,13
to get themselves a really cool
celebrity fun nickname--


99
0:3:50,13 --> 0:3:54,1
like Brad Pitt and Angelina
Jolie are Brangelina, Ben


100
0:3:54,1 --> 0:3:56,79
Affleck and Jennifer Garner
are Bennifer.


101
0:3:56,79 --> 0:4:2,49
And Keith Urban and Nicole
Kidman are Keyhole, I think.


102
0:4:2,49 --> 0:4:3,87
Listen, could we--


103
0:4:3,87 --> 0:4:5,42
might have to research
that, yes--


104
0:4:5,42 --> 0:4:6,3
OK, cool.


105
0:4:6,3 --> 0:4:7,26
I'm--


106
0:4:7,26 --> 0:4:7,59
yep--


107
0:4:7,59 --> 0:4:9,96
I'm being told I don't
have an earpiece.


108
0:4:9,96 --> 0:4:11,97
Good.


109
0:4:11,97 --> 0:4:14,4
But it's now even gone
even further, where--


110
0:4:14,4 --> 0:4:16,355
I don't know if you've noticed,
but the celebrities


111
0:4:16,355 --> 0:4:19,94
are so bang up for a crazy name,
they're giving all their


112
0:4:19,94 --> 0:4:22,3
kids crazy names.


113
0:4:22,3 --> 0:4:23,47
Yes, says the audience.


114
0:4:23,47 --> 0:4:26,1
I've noticed, too.


115
0:4:26,1 --> 0:4:29,16
Yeah, observant.


116
0:4:29,16 --> 0:4:30,3
Because that's how you
all talk to me.


117
0:4:30,3 --> 0:4:33,41
You've suddenly become very
well-spoken British.


118
0:4:33,41 --> 0:4:36,86
I'm a YouTube audience member.


119
0:4:36,86 --> 0:4:39,15
I cannot be trusted with
a real candle,


120
0:4:39,15 --> 0:4:41,24
however, but still.


121
0:4:41,24 --> 0:4:44,21
Ah, ah.


122
0:4:44,21 --> 0:4:44,84
But, yeah.


123
0:4:44,84 --> 0:4:49,25
Crazy baby names, like Beyonce
might be having another one.


124
0:4:49,25 --> 0:4:51,46
Blue Ivy was her first.


125
0:4:51,46 --> 0:4:52,443
That was great.


126
0:4:52,443 --> 0:4:55,26
Other great names out there,
thank you celebrities--


127
0:4:55,26 --> 0:5:1,76
Apple, Shiloh, Suri, Banjo,
Moon Unit, that's a name.


128
0:5:1,76 --> 0:5:5,5
My favorite, though, I think,
would be Nicolas Cage, the


129
0:5:5,5 --> 0:5:10,71
actor Nicolas Cage, as opposed
to the mechanic Nicolas Cage.


130
0:5:10,71 --> 0:5:12,31
I don't know why I needed
to bring that up,


131
0:5:12,31 --> 0:5:13,45
but there you go.


132
0:5:13,45 --> 0:5:17,67
But Nicolas Cage named
his son Kal-El.


133
0:5:17,67 --> 0:5:23,97
K-A-L hyphen E-L. Does anybody
in the room tonight know the


134
0:5:23,97 --> 0:5:25,95
significance of that name?


135
0:5:25,95 --> 0:5:27,34
Yes, yell it out.


136
0:5:27,34 --> 0:5:27,82
Yell out.


137
0:5:27,82 --> 0:5:28,46
AUDIENCE: Superman.


138
0:5:28,46 --> 0:5:29,88
ROVE MCMANUS: Superman,
yes, yes.


139
0:5:29,88 --> 0:5:30,92
Be proud, nerd.


140
0:5:30,92 --> 0:5:33,3
He's into Superman.


141
0:5:33,3 --> 0:5:34,28
Yell it out, my friend.


142
0:5:34,28 --> 0:5:37,57



143
0:5:37,57 --> 0:5:39,16
Sure.


144
0:5:39,16 --> 0:5:40,93
You may as well yell it out
because if you know this,


145
0:5:40,93 --> 0:5:43,3
you're not getting laid
tonight, so be proud.


146
0:5:43,3 --> 0:5:44,27
Get it out there.


147
0:5:44,27 --> 0:5:46,58
For those of you who don't
know-- and you probably will


148
0:5:46,58 --> 0:5:48,38
in the next couple of months
with the movie coming--


149
0:5:48,38 --> 0:5:52,73
Kal-El is Superman's birth
name, from his


150
0:5:52,73 --> 0:5:56,3
home planet of Krypton.


151
0:5:56,3 --> 0:5:58,91
Well done, Nicolas Cage.


152
0:5:58,91 --> 0:6:1,34
You've just come up with the
perfect way to make sure that


153
0:6:1,34 --> 0:6:4,3
your son comes home from school
with his underpants on


154
0:6:4,3 --> 0:6:5,94
the outside as well.


155
0:6:5,94 --> 0:6:8,57
Genius.


156
0:6:8,57 --> 0:6:11,58
Well, ladies and gentlemen, you
have plenty of fantastic


157
0:6:11,58 --> 0:6:13,81
acts coming up tonight.


158
0:6:13,81 --> 0:6:15,96
You have logged on to a
wonderful show, Comedy Week


159
0:6:15,96 --> 0:6:18,29
here on YouTube, international
night.


160
0:6:18,29 --> 0:6:21,165
One more round of applause
as we get into it.


161
0:6:21,165 --> 0:6:23,77
Our first performer tonight,
ladies and


162
0:6:23,77 --> 0:6:25,687
gentlemen, Daniel Kinno.


163
0:6:25,687 --> 0:6:32,37



164
0:6:32,37 --> 0:6:32,76
DANIEL KINNO: Thank you.


165
0:6:32,76 --> 0:6:36,45
Give a go for Rove one
more time, your host.


166
0:6:36,45 --> 0:6:38,72



167
0:6:38,72 --> 0:6:40,712
Thank you.


168
0:6:40,712 --> 0:6:43,7
It's good to be back
in America.


169
0:6:43,7 --> 0:6:46,25
I just got back from Canada.


170
0:6:46,25 --> 0:6:48,88
Funny already, all right.


171
0:6:48,88 --> 0:6:50,58
I was in Winnipeg, Canada.


172
0:6:50,58 --> 0:6:51,63
When I was there, somebody
goes, are you


173
0:6:51,63 --> 0:6:52,55
nervous to be here?


174
0:6:52,55 --> 0:6:55,67
It's the murder capital
of Canada.


175
0:6:55,67 --> 0:6:57,81
Murder capital of Canada.


176
0:6:57,81 --> 0:6:59,51
I got all scared,
I Googled it--


177
0:6:59,51 --> 0:7:2,53
35 people a year.


178
0:7:2,53 --> 0:7:6,11
That is adorable.


179
0:7:6,11 --> 0:7:7,24
I live in Los Angeles.


180
0:7:7,24 --> 0:7:9,75
35 people got killed in my
apartment building last year.


181
0:7:9,75 --> 0:7:12,26



182
0:7:12,26 --> 0:7:13,51
We didn't even call the cops.


183
0:7:13,51 --> 0:7:16,39



184
0:7:16,39 --> 0:7:17,32
So I kept reading.


185
0:7:17,32 --> 0:7:19,8
They don't kill each other as
much as we do in Canada.


186
0:7:19,8 --> 0:7:22,56
Only 500 people get murdered
in Canada a year.


187
0:7:22,56 --> 0:7:24,42
America, 20,000.


188
0:7:24,42 --> 0:7:25,48
We're number one, yay.


189
0:7:25,48 --> 0:7:28,67
Pew, pew, pew pew.


190
0:7:28,67 --> 0:7:29,58
So they got us beat there.


191
0:7:29,58 --> 0:7:31,86
But here's something odd-- and
this is true-- their suicide


192
0:7:31,86 --> 0:7:35,34
rate in Canada is four times
their murder rate.


193
0:7:35,34 --> 0:7:38,23
2,000 people kill themselves
every year.


194
0:7:38,23 --> 0:7:39,784
That's weird, right?


195
0:7:39,784 --> 0:7:40,65
How does that even work?


196
0:7:40,65 --> 0:7:41,84
Somebody breaks into
your house in the


197
0:7:41,84 --> 0:7:42,39
middle of the night.


198
0:7:42,39 --> 0:7:43,99
You're like, oh my god, are you
think about killing me?


199
0:7:43,99 --> 0:7:47,3
Me, too, me too.


200
0:7:47,3 --> 0:7:49,8
What a coinkydink.


201
0:7:49,8 --> 0:7:50,47
Don't even waste your bullets,
I already got


202
0:7:50,47 --> 0:7:52,72
the sleeping pills.


203
0:7:52,72 --> 0:7:55,46
Well, it's either that or they
have the dumbest cops in the


204
0:7:55,46 --> 0:7:56,32
world in Canada.


205
0:7:56,32 --> 0:7:57,82
They think everything's
a fucking suicide.


206
0:7:57,82 --> 0:8:3,54



207
0:8:3,54 --> 0:8:5,78
They show up at a crime scene,
get off their horses or


208
0:8:5,78 --> 0:8:8,76
whatever they do,
I don't know.


209
0:8:8,76 --> 0:8:9,3
Hey, what happened here?


210
0:8:9,3 --> 0:8:11,845
Oh my god, this is the worst
suicide I've ever seen.


211
0:8:11,845 --> 0:8:15,5



212
0:8:15,5 --> 0:8:18,73
This guy must have
been so sad.


213
0:8:18,73 --> 0:8:23,44
He broke into his own house,
tied himself to this chair,


214
0:8:23,44 --> 0:8:25,725
and then shot himself in the
back of the head five times.


215
0:8:25,725 --> 0:8:28,95



216
0:8:28,95 --> 0:8:32,559
Some people just don't want
to live, I guess, eh?


217
0:8:32,559 --> 0:8:35,27
Let's go get some free
health care.


218
0:8:35,27 --> 0:8:38,799
More for the rest of us.


219
0:8:38,799 --> 0:8:41,53
I was just in Ch--


220
0:8:41,53 --> 0:8:42,78
that's a weird laugh.


221
0:8:42,78 --> 0:8:45,11



222
0:8:45,11 --> 0:8:46,75
I was reading an article
today about China.


223
0:8:46,75 --> 0:8:47,67
Did you guys know this?


224
0:8:47,67 --> 0:8:49,69
China has the fastest-growing
number of


225
0:8:49,69 --> 0:8:51,716
millionaires in the world.


226
0:8:51,716 --> 0:8:52,6
Did you know that?


227
0:8:52,6 --> 0:8:52,98
Yeah.


228
0:8:52,98 --> 0:8:54,17
It's got to be bittersweet
for them.


229
0:8:54,17 --> 0:8:59,225
No one in China can pronounce
the word "millionaire."


230
0:8:59,225 --> 0:9:2,95
There's a lot of L's and R's,
that's all I'm saying.


231
0:9:2,95 --> 0:9:3,45
Relax.


232
0:9:3,45 --> 0:9:4,52
I've done that joke in China.


233
0:9:4,52 --> 0:9:7,24
They hate it there, too.


234
0:9:7,24 --> 0:9:10,35
Your instincts are in
the right place.


235
0:9:10,35 --> 0:9:12,6
But that's true. "Time Magazine"
said that they spend


236
0:9:12,6 --> 0:9:14,34
so much time and money in
America that the entire mail


237
0:9:14,34 --> 0:9:16,71
order bride trend is
now reversing.


238
0:9:16,71 --> 0:9:19,2
Because it used to be, American
guys would go China,


239
0:9:19,2 --> 0:9:21,22
get a wife, then bring
her back to America.


240
0:9:21,22 --> 0:9:23,84
Now Chinese millionaires
are coming over here


241
0:9:23,84 --> 0:9:25,9
to pick up our sluts.


242
0:9:25,9 --> 0:9:27,662



243
0:9:27,662 --> 0:9:28,23
That's messed up.


244
0:9:28,23 --> 0:9:29,48
Those are our sluts.


245
0:9:29,48 --> 0:9:31,7



246
0:9:31,7 --> 0:9:33,69
We can't even hide these
girls from the Chinese


247
0:9:33,69 --> 0:9:34,48
millionaires, right?


248
0:9:34,48 --> 0:9:35,86
They all have Chinese
shit tattooed


249
0:9:35,86 --> 0:9:37,11
right above their asses.


250
0:9:37,11 --> 0:9:41,68



251
0:9:41,68 --> 0:9:42,9
If you have one here, relax.


252
0:9:42,9 --> 0:9:44,1
I'm sure you're not a slut.


253
0:9:44,1 --> 0:9:45,595
I'm sure you're into strength
and courage.


254
0:9:45,595 --> 0:9:50,18



255
0:9:50,18 --> 0:9:50,88
I did that joke one time.


256
0:9:50,88 --> 0:9:52,14
A girl came up to me
after the show.


257
0:9:52,14 --> 0:9:53,2
She goes, you're an asshole.


258
0:9:53,2 --> 0:9:55,39
I'm spiritual.


259
0:9:55,39 --> 0:9:58,25
Yeah, you sound like it.


260
0:9:58,25 --> 0:9:59,84
That's a whole lot of
enlightenment coming out of


261
0:9:59,84 --> 0:10:1,52
your mouth right there.


262
0:10:1,52 --> 0:10:3,47
Just because you put a Chinese
symbol above your asscrack


263
0:10:3,47 --> 0:10:5,95
doesn't bring you closer
to Buddha, OK?


264
0:10:5,95 --> 0:10:9,15
It brings you closer
to my hotel room.


265
0:10:9,15 --> 0:10:11,335
There's nothing spiritual
about that experience?


266
0:10:11,335 --> 0:10:13,1
It's more of a Catholic
thing, really.


267
0:10:13,1 --> 0:10:17,36



268
0:10:17,36 --> 0:10:19,615
People get touchy
about Catholics.


269
0:10:19,615 --> 0:10:20,36
Don't worry.


270
0:10:20,36 --> 0:10:21,61
Catholics get touchy, too.


271
0:10:21,61 --> 0:10:25,29



272
0:10:25,29 --> 0:10:26,54
It's all good.


273
0:10:26,54 --> 0:10:30,15



274
0:10:30,15 --> 0:10:32,36
I knew that Catholics were
up to no good, right.


275
0:10:32,36 --> 0:10:34,49
They have a room in the church
called the rectory.


276
0:10:34,49 --> 0:10:37,15
What did you think was going
to happen to you?


277
0:10:37,15 --> 0:10:40,305
I'm never a following a horny
old guy into a rectory.


278
0:10:40,305 --> 0:10:46,76
Can we just stay here in the
hand job-ory until my parents


279
0:10:46,76 --> 0:10:48,622
pick me up?


280
0:10:48,622 --> 0:10:50,61
Then I can go to the shrink-ory,
pretend this shit


281
0:10:50,61 --> 0:10:51,86
never happened.


282
0:10:51,86 --> 0:10:54,47



283
0:10:54,47 --> 0:10:55,85
Tell you a little bit
about myself.


284
0:10:55,85 --> 0:10:57,84
I was born in Russia.


285
0:10:57,84 --> 0:10:59,572
A lot of people don't believe
me when I say that because I


286
0:10:59,572 --> 0:11:2,82
don't sound like a James
Bond villain.


287
0:11:2,82 --> 0:11:5,5
I did my best to lose the accent
because girls say they


288
0:11:5,5 --> 0:11:5,81
like accents--


289
0:11:5,81 --> 0:11:7,53
not the Russian one.


290
0:11:7,53 --> 0:11:9,47
That is not a sexy accent.


291
0:11:9,47 --> 0:11:11,24
You never see a Russian
lover in a movie.


292
0:11:11,24 --> 0:11:11,345
[RUSSIAN ACCENT]


293
0:11:11,345 --> 0:11:12,595
Hello, how are you?


294
0:11:12,595 --> 0:11:15,219



295
0:11:15,219 --> 0:11:19,56
You are a pretty
female person.


296
0:11:19,56 --> 0:11:21,88
Would you like to drink vodka
and then complete me?


297
0:11:21,88 --> 0:11:25,24



298
0:11:25,24 --> 0:11:25,84
But that's true.


299
0:11:25,84 --> 0:11:27,82
I was born in Russia
in a small town


300
0:11:27,82 --> 0:11:30,4
right outside of Chernobyl.


301
0:11:30,4 --> 0:11:30,88
People find that odd.


302
0:11:30,88 --> 0:11:32,545
They always go, Daniel, growing
up near Chernobyl, did


303
0:11:32,545 --> 0:11:34,57
that affect you in any way?


304
0:11:34,57 --> 0:11:35,86
And it did.


305
0:11:35,86 --> 0:11:39,2
I have a giant penis.


306
0:11:39,2 --> 0:11:41,345
Unfortunately, it's right
above my tiny vagina.


307
0:11:41,345 --> 0:11:46,71



308
0:11:46,71 --> 0:11:47,79
That's a radiation joke.


309
0:11:47,79 --> 0:11:50,14
That's not a dick joke.


310
0:11:50,14 --> 0:11:51,5
Google Chernobyl.


311
0:11:51,5 --> 0:11:52,38
It'll be funnier.


312
0:11:52,38 --> 0:11:53,34
I Google everything now.


313
0:11:53,34 --> 0:11:54,19
Google's amazing.


314
0:11:54,19 --> 0:11:56,41
It's unnecessary for you to
learn how to spell the word


315
0:11:56,41 --> 0:11:59,68
"unnecessary." You can throw
a U, two N's, and a C into


316
0:11:59,68 --> 0:12:1,98
Google, it goes, did you mean
"unnecessary?" Yes, I did.


317
0:12:1,98 --> 0:12:4,45
Thank you.


318
0:12:4,45 --> 0:12:5,53
Let's move this along.


319
0:12:5,53 --> 0:12:8,34
I don't know how people did
anything before the internet.


320
0:12:8,34 --> 0:12:11,62
They went to the moon
before the internet.


321
0:12:11,62 --> 0:12:12,9
How did they even
know there was a


322
0:12:12,9 --> 0:12:15,39
moon before the internet?


323
0:12:15,39 --> 0:12:16,68
Some places still
don't have it.


324
0:12:16,68 --> 0:12:18,23
That weirds me out.


325
0:12:18,23 --> 0:12:20,26
I was checking into a hotel a
couple weeks ago, and I go, is


326
0:12:20,26 --> 0:12:21,58
there internet in my room?


327
0:12:21,58 --> 0:12:24,1
And the guy looks at me and he
goes, no, but there is a phone


328
0:12:24,1 --> 0:12:26,95
in your room.


329
0:12:26,95 --> 0:12:32,98
There's a phone in my pants,
and it has internet.


330
0:12:32,98 --> 0:12:36,16



331
0:12:36,16 --> 0:12:37,2
All right, guys,
that's my time.


332
0:12:37,2 --> 0:12:38,27
Thank you very much.


333
0:12:38,27 --> 0:12:40,71



334
0:12:40,71 --> 0:12:41,605
CAT: My wife's in heat.


335
0:12:41,605 --> 0:12:42,53
Let me tell you something.


336
0:12:42,53 --> 0:12:43,92
There's nothing worse than
being married when


337
0:12:43,92 --> 0:12:46,386
your wife's in heat.


338
0:12:46,386 --> 0:12:49,655
You know that voice, right?


339
0:12:49,655 --> 0:12:52,64
She's always like, Mr.
Sprinkles, I'm in heat.


340
0:12:52,64 --> 0:12:55,401
Let's have sex.


341
0:12:55,401 --> 0:12:57,568
And I'm like, I don't want
to fuck Garfield.


342
0:12:57,568 --> 0:13:6,68



343
0:13:6,68 --> 0:13:9,2
ROVE MCMANUS: You'll have to
excuse our studio audience


344
0:13:9,2 --> 0:13:12,4
while they go, did I just see
what I thought I just saw?


345
0:13:12,4 --> 0:13:13,82
You're probably all thinking
the same thing.


346
0:13:13,82 --> 0:13:15,96
All right, we are moving
hastily along.


347
0:13:15,96 --> 0:13:20,41
As wonderful as that cat in a
suit was, I'm going to bring


348
0:13:20,41 --> 0:13:24,9
on our next performer, a man
I have had the pleasure of


349
0:13:24,9 --> 0:13:25,99
performing with on
many an occasion.


350
0:13:25,99 --> 0:13:27,47
I think he's fantastic.


351
0:13:27,47 --> 0:13:28,85
I know you will, too.


352
0:13:28,85 --> 0:13:31,996
Ladies and gentlemen,
Matt Kirshen.


353
0:13:31,996 --> 0:13:33,424
MATT KIRSHEN: Thank you.


354
0:13:33,424 --> 0:13:34,852
Thank you.


355
0:13:34,852 --> 0:13:35,328
ROVE MCMANUS: Hey.


356
0:13:35,328 --> 0:13:35,804
MATT KIRSHEN: Thank you.


357
0:13:35,804 --> 0:13:37,24
Rove McManus, ladies
and gentlemen.


358
0:13:37,24 --> 0:13:38,792
It's Rove.


359
0:13:38,792 --> 0:13:40,268
Rove, yeah.


360
0:13:40,268 --> 0:13:43,22



361
0:13:43,22 --> 0:13:44,34
This is exciting.


362
0:13:44,34 --> 0:13:45,61
Geez, I didn't--


363
0:13:45,61 --> 0:13:51,71
if you'd told me as a kid
growing up in 1980s London


364
0:13:51,71 --> 0:13:58,46
that one day I would be on
youtube.com, I wouldn't've


365
0:13:58,46 --> 0:13:59,71
believed you.


366
0:13:59,71 --> 0:14:1,75



367
0:14:1,75 --> 0:14:2,75
I'd be like, no way.


368
0:14:2,75 --> 0:14:6,456
No kid like me gets
on youtube.com.


369
0:14:6,456 --> 0:14:14,115
Maybe President Barack Obama
gets on youtube.com, but not a


370
0:14:14,115 --> 0:14:17,76
little Englishman like me.


371
0:14:17,76 --> 0:14:18,48
So thank you.


372
0:14:18,48 --> 0:14:19,38
Thank you, people here.


373
0:14:19,38 --> 0:14:22,14
Thank you, viewers at home, for
taking time out of your


374
0:14:22,14 --> 0:14:24,53
lazy masturbation to flick
over to my tab.


375
0:14:24,53 --> 0:14:27,9



376
0:14:27,9 --> 0:14:28,6
It's what I'd be doing if I
was watching this at home.


377
0:14:28,6 --> 0:14:30,27
I'd have both going
at the same time.


378
0:14:30,27 --> 0:14:32,8



379
0:14:32,8 --> 0:14:35,24
One eye on me, one on the porn--
get mixed up in your


380
0:14:35,24 --> 0:14:36,49
head, good things happen.


381
0:14:36,49 --> 0:14:38,99



382
0:14:38,99 --> 0:14:40,5
Somewhere an association's
being made, and


383
0:14:40,5 --> 0:14:43,38
I appreciate that.


384
0:14:43,38 --> 0:14:44,77
So this just happened
to me the other day.


385
0:14:44,77 --> 0:14:46,91
I still haven't processed it.


386
0:14:46,91 --> 0:14:49,45
Because I work nights,
this is my job.


387
0:14:49,45 --> 0:14:51,71
So I finish work, and then
I do normal things.


388
0:14:51,71 --> 0:14:54,13
So I do things like grocery
shopping in the


389
0:14:54,13 --> 0:14:54,93
middle of the night.


390
0:14:54,93 --> 0:14:57,68
I'll do it at 2:00 in the
morning when it's just me and


391
0:14:57,68 --> 0:15:2,91
drunks, all right, and the
occasional nurse and the


392
0:15:2,91 --> 0:15:6,0
occasional drunk nurse.


393
0:15:6,0 --> 0:15:7,36
I love that.


394
0:15:7,36 --> 0:15:10,55
I love a drunk nurse, not even
for any creepy reasons.


395
0:15:10,55 --> 0:15:13,22
It's just like, nurses have
the best stories, and if


396
0:15:13,22 --> 0:15:14,505
they're drunk, they share.


397
0:15:14,505 --> 0:15:17,11



398
0:15:17,11 --> 0:15:20,93
Nurses have stories that would
put a sea captain to shame.


399
0:15:20,93 --> 0:15:23,82
Stories with lines in it like,
no, you have to understand.


400
0:15:23,82 --> 0:15:25,52
It was a full-sized umbrella.


401
0:15:25,52 --> 0:15:28,97



402
0:15:28,97 --> 0:15:32,34
But I was just in this 24 hour
store, just buying normal


403
0:15:32,34 --> 0:15:33,57
groceries at 2:00 in
the morning, like


404
0:15:33,57 --> 0:15:35,19
bread, milk, cereal.


405
0:15:35,19 --> 0:15:37,58
And I put my basket of food next
to the register, and I


406
0:15:37,58 --> 0:15:38,85
went to get a couple
more things.


407
0:15:38,85 --> 0:15:42,13
And I came back,
and it's gone.


408
0:15:42,13 --> 0:15:43,16
My basket's gone.


409
0:15:43,16 --> 0:15:45,1
So I'm looking for the
overzealous employee who's


410
0:15:45,1 --> 0:15:47,47
putting everything back.


411
0:15:47,47 --> 0:15:51,14
And then I see the most
confused-looking drunk man


412
0:15:51,14 --> 0:15:53,12
leaving with my stuff.


413
0:15:53,12 --> 0:15:56,17
He bought my things.


414
0:15:56,17 --> 0:15:57,5
He bought my--


415
0:15:57,5 --> 0:16:0,48
I don't even know if
that's a crime.


416
0:16:0,48 --> 0:16:0,9
I don't know.


417
0:16:0,9 --> 0:16:2,85
If anyone at home knows,
comment in.


418
0:16:2,85 --> 0:16:4,41
I don't know what
the legality--


419
0:16:4,41 --> 0:16:5,85
I think until you pay
for something, it


420
0:16:5,85 --> 0:16:7,84
belongs to the store.


421
0:16:7,84 --> 0:16:10,75
And then he paid for
it, so it's his.


422
0:16:10,75 --> 0:16:14,78
But I selected it.


423
0:16:14,78 --> 0:16:16,96
I put all the work in.


424
0:16:16,96 --> 0:16:19,48
I got like a week's worth
of food, and he just


425
0:16:19,48 --> 0:16:22,77
waltzed off with it.


426
0:16:22,77 --> 0:16:25,8
I couldn't even be mad at him,
either, because he was so


427
0:16:25,8 --> 0:16:28,85
drunk and so baffled.


428
0:16:28,85 --> 0:16:31,79
Because from his point of view,
that's just the world's


429
0:16:31,79 --> 0:16:36,44
most convenient convenience
store.


430
0:16:36,44 --> 0:16:38,88
He's just staggered in,
hammered, and the guy's like,


431
0:16:38,88 --> 0:16:39,38
what do you want?


432
0:16:39,38 --> 0:16:43,49
He's like, this.


433
0:16:43,49 --> 0:16:46,5
Thank you.


434
0:16:46,5 --> 0:16:47,28
Thank you, convenience store.


435
0:16:47,28 --> 0:16:49,8
I'll be back here every night.


436
0:16:49,8 --> 0:16:50,57
This is wonderful.


437
0:16:50,57 --> 0:16:51,925
I don't remember having a cat.


438
0:16:51,925 --> 0:16:55,52



439
0:16:55,52 --> 0:16:58,35
Either that, or he was so drunk,
he'd forgotten that he


440
0:16:58,35 --> 0:17:0,68
hadn't already gone to the
effort of selecting


441
0:17:0,68 --> 0:17:2,321
everything.


442
0:17:2,321 --> 0:17:4,599
Have you ever done that thing
where you're really drunk and


443
0:17:4,599 --> 0:17:7,656
your brain just starts
to do useful things?


444
0:17:7,656 --> 0:17:9,856
Am I the only one
who does that?


445
0:17:9,856 --> 0:17:11,849
Who's just hammered and
thinking, well, I'm


446
0:17:11,849 --> 0:17:12,45
slaughtered.


447
0:17:12,45 --> 0:17:15,924
Everything's fun, so I might as
well get some chores done.


448
0:17:15,924 --> 0:17:18,47



449
0:17:18,47 --> 0:17:21,1
You wake up the next morning and
all the bathroom tiles are


450
0:17:21,1 --> 0:17:26,17
clean, but you've vomited
in the freezer.


451
0:17:26,17 --> 0:17:28,64
It's a trade-off.


452
0:17:28,64 --> 0:17:30,8
The entire apartment's
vacuumed, but


453
0:17:30,8 --> 0:17:34,132
you've killed a man.


454
0:17:34,132 --> 0:17:35,382
It's give and take.


455
0:17:35,382 --> 0:17:38,12



456
0:17:38,12 --> 0:17:41,8
Gee, Daniel going straight in
with the Catholic stuff, at a


457
0:17:41,8 --> 0:17:43,41
time that we have a
new pope, as well.


458
0:17:43,41 --> 0:17:45,68
Of all the times to
be doing that.


459
0:17:45,68 --> 0:17:48,87
The pope is barely out of--


460
0:17:48,87 --> 0:17:52,38
I don't know where
popes come from.


461
0:17:52,38 --> 0:17:55,45
He says that-- first
Latin-American pope, as well.


462
0:17:55,45 --> 0:17:57,1
First pope from Latin America.


463
0:17:57,1 --> 0:17:57,577
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]


464
0:17:57,577 --> 0:17:59,485
MATT KIRSHEN: I know.


465
0:17:59,485 --> 0:18:1,6
Yeah, it's pretty cool, right?


466
0:18:1,6 --> 0:18:3,485
I mean, don't worry.


467
0:18:3,485 --> 0:18:7,83
He's still white and hates gays,
so they kept it safe on


468
0:18:7,83 --> 0:18:8,16
that front.


469
0:18:8,16 --> 0:18:9,66
They kept the light-skinned
homophobe theme


470
0:18:9,66 --> 0:18:12,66
that's working so well.


471
0:18:12,66 --> 0:18:14,9
It's an exciting time
for gay rights.


472
0:18:14,9 --> 0:18:15,27
We had the debate in the UK.


473
0:18:15,27 --> 0:18:17,18
It got passed by Parliament.


474
0:18:17,18 --> 0:18:20,13
The conservative prime minister
voted for gay


475
0:18:20,13 --> 0:18:22,21
marriage, which is remarkable.


476
0:18:22,21 --> 0:18:23,65
That's never happened before.


477
0:18:23,65 --> 0:18:25,4
Not everyone was for it.


478
0:18:25,4 --> 0:18:27,92
One guy in the middle of the
debate actually said the


479
0:18:27,92 --> 0:18:33,25
words, Adam and Eve,
not Adam and Steve.


480
0:18:33,25 --> 0:18:37,13
He said that, out loud, knowing
that other people were


481
0:18:37,13 --> 0:18:40,26
listening, as well, knowing
that his words were being


482
0:18:40,26 --> 0:18:41,8
recorded and everything.


483
0:18:41,8 --> 0:18:43,85
He thought that was a
good thing to say.


484
0:18:43,85 --> 0:18:46,88
That's on a par with, if it
was a debate about whether


485
0:18:46,88 --> 0:18:49,4
women should have equal pay in
the workplace, and he'd just


486
0:18:49,4 --> 0:18:53,49
stood up and gone, girls smell,
and sat down again.


487
0:18:53,49 --> 0:18:57,5
That's the same level
of sophistication.


488
0:18:57,5 --> 0:19:1,41
He is my second-favorite
homophobe.


489
0:19:1,41 --> 0:19:4,58
I know it's weird to have
them ranked, but I do.


490
0:19:4,58 --> 0:19:6,3
My number one is,
and I think will


491
0:19:6,3 --> 0:19:9,71
always be, Michele Bachmann.


492
0:19:9,71 --> 0:19:11,94
She has to be because she's the
only one I know who's that


493
0:19:11,94 --> 0:19:18,73
homophobic while being married
to such an obviously gay man.


494
0:19:18,73 --> 0:19:19,46
He's so gay.


495
0:19:19,46 --> 0:19:21,55
I know I'm like libeling someone
on a livestreaming


496
0:19:21,55 --> 0:19:23,66
thing right now, but he's so--


497
0:19:23,66 --> 0:19:25,77
if he's not gay, he's putting
a lot of effort


498
0:19:25,77 --> 0:19:26,85
into appearing gay.


499
0:19:26,85 --> 0:19:29,55
He is really-- have you seen?


500
0:19:29,55 --> 0:19:31,3
You're on YouTube right now.


501
0:19:31,3 --> 0:19:34,77
Don't do it right-- open up
another tab next to my one,


502
0:19:34,77 --> 0:19:37,13
and YouTube "Marcus Bachmann
interview."


503
0:19:37,13 --> 0:19:38,56
He is ridiculous.


504
0:19:38,56 --> 0:19:40,73
I know not everyone who sounds
like that is gay, and not


505
0:19:40,73 --> 0:19:41,82
everyone who's gay
sounds like that.


506
0:19:41,82 --> 0:19:45,11
But the two of them
are absurd.


507
0:19:45,11 --> 0:19:47,31
In the modern era when people
are becoming so much more


508
0:19:47,31 --> 0:19:50,36
accepting, they exist.


509
0:19:50,36 --> 0:19:52,59
Last year I was in San Francisco
during Pride


510
0:19:52,59 --> 0:19:55,18
weekend, and I would urge any
of you to go there, whatever


511
0:19:55,18 --> 0:19:56,14
your sexuality.


512
0:19:56,14 --> 0:19:58,77
I was there as a straight guy
with my girlfriend, and it's


513
0:19:58,77 --> 0:20:0,62
one of the best celebrations
on Earth of


514
0:20:0,62 --> 0:20:2,37
humanity and sexuality.


515
0:20:2,37 --> 0:20:3,77
It's just a massive
party where the


516
0:20:3,77 --> 0:20:6,4
only theme is tolerance.


517
0:20:6,4 --> 0:20:8,656
And walking through the middle
of this park, around which a


518
0:20:8,656 --> 0:20:11,89
lot of the events are centered,
were these two guys.


519
0:20:11,89 --> 0:20:16,16
And they were in great physical
shape, which we could


520
0:20:16,16 --> 0:20:24,46
clearly tell because all they
were wearing were shoes and


521
0:20:24,46 --> 0:20:27,82
matching cock rings.


522
0:20:27,82 --> 0:20:29,1
I hope intentionally,
by the way.


523
0:20:29,1 --> 0:20:31,18
I hope that was planned between
the two of them.


524
0:20:31,18 --> 0:20:33,22
I'd hate to think they rocked up
independently and like, oh,


525
0:20:33,22 --> 0:20:35,54
you as well.


526
0:20:35,54 --> 0:20:37,56
Oh, well, there's no time to
go home and change, either.


527
0:20:37,56 --> 0:20:39,87
This is embarrassing.


528
0:20:39,87 --> 0:20:41,54
But they were walking through
the middle of the park


529
0:20:41,54 --> 0:20:44,22
together, and it was hilarious
and it was wonderful and it


530
0:20:44,22 --> 0:20:46,6
was fantastic.


531
0:20:46,6 --> 0:20:52,91
And it was absurdly gay, but
still not as gay as Marcus


532
0:20:52,91 --> 0:20:55,67
Bachmann's voice.


533
0:20:55,67 --> 0:20:57,32
Thank you very much for
listening to my


534
0:20:57,32 --> 0:20:58,52
part of this evening.


535
0:20:58,52 --> 0:20:58,915
Take care.


536
0:20:58,915 --> 0:20:59,81
I appreciate it.


537
0:20:59,81 --> 0:21:0,24
I've been Matt Kirshen.


538
0:21:0,24 --> 0:21:1,275
Bye!


539
0:21:1,275 --> 0:21:2,512
ROVE MCMANUS: Matt Kirshen.


540
0:21:2,512 --> 0:21:3,376
MATT KIRSHEN: Thank you.


541
0:21:3,376 --> 0:21:4,626
ROVE MCMANUS: Matt Kirshen.


542
0:21:4,626 --> 0:21:7,59



543
0:21:7,59 --> 0:21:9,89
Yeah.


544
0:21:9,89 --> 0:21:14,48
Later, Matt and I are going
to go to Six Flags with an


545
0:21:14,48 --> 0:21:16,39
oversized coat.


546
0:21:16,39 --> 0:21:19,66
He's going to get
on my shoulders.


547
0:21:19,66 --> 0:21:22,3
X2, here we come.


548
0:21:22,3 --> 0:21:26,7
It's a roller coaster, for
those of you not in the


549
0:21:26,7 --> 0:21:27,6
Angeleno way.


550
0:21:27,6 --> 0:21:28,93
And I don't know what
that means.


551
0:21:28,93 --> 0:21:31,57
As I say "Angeleno way," it
suddenly means you're pregnant


552
0:21:31,57 --> 0:21:32,89
with a Californian.


553
0:21:32,89 --> 0:21:33,8
Could be a thing,
you don't know.


554
0:21:33,8 --> 0:21:35,5
Look it up.


555
0:21:35,5 --> 0:21:38,75
This is one of the things I have
found having moved here


556
0:21:38,75 --> 0:21:44,12
to the States from Australia,
is adjusting a little bit.


557
0:21:44,12 --> 0:21:46,97
And, for the most part, it's not
too difficult, but one of


558
0:21:46,97 --> 0:21:51,2
the things I have kind of
struggled with is tipping.


559
0:21:51,2 --> 0:21:54,66
Because we don't tip
as readily as you


560
0:21:54,66 --> 0:21:55,715
do here in the States.


561
0:21:55,715 --> 0:21:58,32
Yeah, at cafes and stuff,
sure, we'll do it there.


562
0:21:58,32 --> 0:22:1,7
But I had an experience when I
first arrived where I was in


563
0:22:1,7 --> 0:22:3,68
the men's room.


564
0:22:3,68 --> 0:22:6,15
I don't know how it is for the
women, but sometimes in the


565
0:22:6,15 --> 0:22:9,53
men's room, there's a guy, like
an attendant, there--


566
0:22:9,53 --> 0:22:10,24
right guys?


567
0:22:10,24 --> 0:22:10,62
Yes.


568
0:22:10,62 --> 0:22:14,34
He's got cologne and little
hand towels and a bowl of


569
0:22:14,34 --> 0:22:17,76
mints, because that's what you
want when you've just been to


570
0:22:17,76 --> 0:22:19,7
the toilet.


571
0:22:19,7 --> 0:22:21,486
Candy.


572
0:22:21,486 --> 0:22:24,725
How many times have you found
yourself in the situation


573
0:22:24,725 --> 0:22:26,54
going, I just took a dump.


574
0:22:26,54 --> 0:22:30,24
I could really go with
some M&Ms right now.


575
0:22:30,24 --> 0:22:32,54
But he's there with the
towels and everything.


576
0:22:32,54 --> 0:22:35,88
And I don't mean to brag,
YouTube people, but I've been


577
0:22:35,88 --> 0:22:37,8
able to go to the toilet
by myself since


578
0:22:37,8 --> 0:22:39,62
about the age of three.


579
0:22:39,62 --> 0:22:42,2
And so I wasn't sure
of what to do.


580
0:22:42,2 --> 0:22:44,94
So I did what I needed
to do, and then went


581
0:22:44,94 --> 0:22:46,15
past, washed my hands.


582
0:22:46,15 --> 0:22:48,1
The guy gave me a towel.


583
0:22:48,1 --> 0:22:49,9
I was like, thank you.


584
0:22:49,9 --> 0:22:54,73
I dried my hands, then walked
out but didn't tip.


585
0:22:54,73 --> 0:22:56,6
Oh, yes.


586
0:22:56,6 --> 0:22:59,53
I learned a very valuable lesson
that day, because let


587
0:22:59,53 --> 0:23:0,7
me tell you something.


588
0:23:0,7 --> 0:23:4,59
There is no worse look than
you leaving the men's room


589
0:23:4,59 --> 0:23:7,9
with another guy chasing
you demanding payment.


590
0:23:7,9 --> 0:23:11,69



591
0:23:11,69 --> 0:23:14,85
Trap for young players.


592
0:23:14,85 --> 0:23:17,96
It is indeed a pleasure to
welcome our next act, ladies


593
0:23:17,96 --> 0:23:18,3
and gentlemen.


594
0:23:18,3 --> 0:23:20,53
You have seen him on "Conan."
You have seen him on "Jimmy


595
0:23:20,53 --> 0:23:23,57
Kimmel Live." You have seen him
on "Cougar Town." He's a


596
0:23:23,57 --> 0:23:27,26
MILF, the absolutely brilliant
Rob Delaney.


597
0:23:27,26 --> 0:23:31,165



598
0:23:31,165 --> 0:23:32,55
ROB DELANEY: Thank you, sir.


599
0:23:32,55 --> 0:23:35,46
Thank you.


600
0:23:35,46 --> 0:23:38,11
Hello, everybody.


601
0:23:38,11 --> 0:23:40,27
Nice to see you all.


602
0:23:40,27 --> 0:23:42,31
In keeping with the
international theme, I want to


603
0:23:42,31 --> 0:23:43,11
tell you a story.


604
0:23:43,11 --> 0:23:46,61
I recently did a show in
Belfast, in Northern Ireland,


605
0:23:46,61 --> 0:23:49,4
and it's calmed down
in recent years.


606
0:23:49,4 --> 0:23:50,69
It's not as scary anymore.


607
0:23:50,69 --> 0:23:53,5
But the city's covered with
murals back from when it was


608
0:23:53,5 --> 0:23:54,82
going through its Troubles.


609
0:23:54,82 --> 0:23:58,12
And you can hire a cab and get
a ride around and look at all


610
0:23:58,12 --> 0:23:58,63
the murals.


611
0:23:58,63 --> 0:24:0,82
Some of them are really
beautiful, some of them are


612
0:24:0,82 --> 0:24:4,39
sad, like hunger strikers and
stuff, but it's just sort of


613
0:24:4,39 --> 0:24:6,55
how they healed and
dealt with it.


614
0:24:6,55 --> 0:24:8,56
Anyway, I got a cab
driver, and he was


615
0:24:8,56 --> 0:24:9,78
showing me all the murals.


616
0:24:9,78 --> 0:24:12,44
And as he was about to finish,
he said, now I'm going to take


617
0:24:12,44 --> 0:24:13,97
you, and I'm going to
show you the most


618
0:24:13,97 --> 0:24:15,39
powerful mural we've got.


619
0:24:15,39 --> 0:24:16,83
It's my favorite mural.


620
0:24:16,83 --> 0:24:19,17
By I need to tell you, as an
American, there's a symbol on


621
0:24:19,17 --> 0:24:21,49
this mural that you're not
going to understand.


622
0:24:21,49 --> 0:24:24,1
So you'll look at it, sort of
absorb it, let it wash over


623
0:24:24,1 --> 0:24:26,11
you, and then I'll explain
the symbol to you.


624
0:24:26,11 --> 0:24:28,2
So I was excited to learn
about a new symbol.


625
0:24:28,2 --> 0:24:31,75
He pulled around the corner, and
there was this seven-story


626
0:24:31,75 --> 0:24:35,5
tall painting of a British
paramilitary soldier, just


627
0:24:35,5 --> 0:24:38,93
firing tear gas canisters
into a pile of kids.


628
0:24:38,93 --> 0:24:40,6
It was upsetting.


629
0:24:40,6 --> 0:24:43,2
But then in front of it was this
ancient Irish symbol that


630
0:24:43,2 --> 0:24:43,69
he had mentioned.


631
0:24:43,69 --> 0:24:47,77
And what it was, it was a giant
red circle with a slash


632
0:24:47,77 --> 0:24:50,1
through it.


633
0:24:50,1 --> 0:24:53,475
And so I was like, uh-oh.


634
0:24:53,475 --> 0:24:54,66
Uh-oh.


635
0:24:54,66 --> 0:24:55,7
Oh, OK.


636
0:24:55,7 --> 0:24:57,411
And I decided to mess
with him a little.


637
0:24:57,411 --> 0:25:1,8
I was like, OK, so what you're
saying is, you take a thing,


638
0:25:1,8 --> 0:25:4,48
and then you mural up a
building, and then you put


639
0:25:4,48 --> 0:25:6,48
this symbol on it, and the
symbol kind of means you


640
0:25:6,48 --> 0:25:8,15
should do that some more?


641
0:25:8,15 --> 0:25:10,31
And he's like, no, for
goodness' sake.


642
0:25:10,31 --> 0:25:12,56
What I meant-- no, the symbol,
I knew you wouldn't


643
0:25:12,56 --> 0:25:13,49
know what it is.


644
0:25:13,49 --> 0:25:17,96
You take a great red, ruby red
circle and you then circle the


645
0:25:17,96 --> 0:25:19,6
entire building with it.


646
0:25:19,6 --> 0:25:21,82
And then from the northwest to
the southeast, you bisect it


647
0:25:21,82 --> 0:25:23,79
with a mighty red slash.


648
0:25:23,79 --> 0:25:25,99
And what we're saying is,
none for me and mine.


649
0:25:25,99 --> 0:25:27,71
No, none of that.


650
0:25:27,71 --> 0:25:29,48
And I was like, OK, I get it.


651
0:25:29,48 --> 0:25:32,45
So basically you draw something
or whatever, you


652
0:25:32,45 --> 0:25:34,69
take a picture, and then you put
this around there and it's


653
0:25:34,69 --> 0:25:35,98
saying, yeah, a few
more of those?


654
0:25:35,98 --> 0:25:38,304
And he's like, no, for
goodness' sake!


655
0:25:38,304 --> 0:25:41,82
Get the wax out of your American
ears, for god's sake!


656
0:25:41,82 --> 0:25:45,77
And anyway, now you guys know
what that symbol is, too.


657
0:25:45,77 --> 0:25:48,24
So I just wanted to share
that with you guys.


658
0:25:48,24 --> 0:25:50,36
It's my favorite thing that's
happened to me in the last


659
0:25:50,36 --> 0:25:51,98
five years.


660
0:25:51,98 --> 0:25:54,51
Since this is live on the
internet, I want to talk about


661
0:25:54,51 --> 0:25:56,41
internet filth and porn.


662
0:25:56,41 --> 0:25:57,93
I grew up in the '80s.


663
0:25:57,93 --> 0:26:0,57
And when I wanted to masturbate,
I had to write a


664
0:26:0,57 --> 0:26:2,81
letter to a friend's older
brother who lived in


665
0:26:2,81 --> 0:26:4,9
Pennsylvania.


666
0:26:4,9 --> 0:26:7,77
And he would mail me back the
coordinates of where he had


667
0:26:7,77 --> 0:26:10,89
buried a cigar box 11
years ago with a


668
0:26:10,89 --> 0:26:12,8
rain-damaged Playboy.


669
0:26:12,8 --> 0:26:15,59
I would have to take a map, and
I'd have to get a friend.


670
0:26:15,59 --> 0:26:19,18
And we'd have to bring like
victuals and dry goods and


671
0:26:19,18 --> 0:26:20,12
hike though the woods.


672
0:26:20,12 --> 0:26:22,74
We would get there just as the
sun was setting, and we'd dig


673
0:26:22,74 --> 0:26:24,41
it up, there'd be no
more daylight.


674
0:26:24,41 --> 0:26:27,8
So we'd have to jerk off
together just because that's


675
0:26:27,8 --> 0:26:28,37
all the time that was left.


676
0:26:28,37 --> 0:26:31,105



677
0:26:31,105 --> 0:26:32,76
But now with the internet,
it's just filth.


678
0:26:32,76 --> 0:26:35,85
You open your computer, and you
open your AOL homepage,


679
0:26:35,85 --> 0:26:36,76
it's a gaping butthole.


680
0:26:36,76 --> 0:26:38,22
It's just total filth.


681
0:26:38,22 --> 0:26:39,5
Why is it so gross?


682
0:26:39,5 --> 0:26:42,5
I'm just so glad that I grew up
in an age where, when I was


683
0:26:42,5 --> 0:26:44,52
younger, I would have to
jerk off to poetry.


684
0:26:44,52 --> 0:26:48,34
I used to jerk off to
the written word.


685
0:26:48,34 --> 0:26:49,19
You should try it.


686
0:26:49,19 --> 0:26:51,17
But now it just is garbage.


687
0:26:51,17 --> 0:26:52,88
And people are fucking
each other in


688
0:26:52,88 --> 0:26:53,95
their butts a lot online.


689
0:26:53,95 --> 0:26:55,76
And I don't understand that.


690
0:26:55,76 --> 0:26:56,99
And I'm not speaking
out of school here.


691
0:26:56,99 --> 0:26:57,56
I tried it.


692
0:26:57,56 --> 0:26:59,9
When I was in college, I had a
girlfriend, and we were like,


693
0:26:59,9 --> 0:27:1,5
hey, I heard people buttfuck.


694
0:27:1,5 --> 0:27:3,78
And it wasn't even me.


695
0:27:3,78 --> 0:27:5,97
I wasn't like, it's
my birthday.


696
0:27:5,97 --> 0:27:8,5
Can I?


697
0:27:8,5 --> 0:27:9,64
Literally, it might have
even been her idea.


698
0:27:9,64 --> 0:27:10,1
I don't remember.


699
0:27:10,1 --> 0:27:11,46
I didn't have a hankering
for it.


700
0:27:11,46 --> 0:27:14,64
And so we were going
to do it, right?


701
0:27:14,64 --> 0:27:16,81
So we're having normal
penis-vagina sex, and then


702
0:27:16,81 --> 0:27:17,47
she's like, yeah, go ahead.


703
0:27:17,47 --> 0:27:19,47
So I take it out and I
just, like, started.


704
0:27:19,47 --> 0:27:20,86
And she was like, oh, god, no.


705
0:27:20,86 --> 0:27:21,66
And I was like, oh,
I'm so sorry.


706
0:27:21,66 --> 0:27:23,6
I'm so sorry.


707
0:27:23,6 --> 0:27:23,625
We'll never do it again.


708
0:27:23,625 --> 0:27:23,93
I'm very sorry.


709
0:27:23,93 --> 0:27:25,47
I want you to enjoy
what we do.


710
0:27:25,47 --> 0:27:26,66
Let's go get a falafel.


711
0:27:26,66 --> 0:27:29,386
And she was like, [GRUNTS].


712
0:27:29,386 --> 0:27:32,895
And she goes, no, you need
to know what it was like.


713
0:27:32,895 --> 0:27:34,66
And I was like, what it--


714
0:27:34,66 --> 0:27:36,7
it seems awful.


715
0:27:36,7 --> 0:27:37,41
I believe you.


716
0:27:37,41 --> 0:27:38,74
She was like, no, you
need to know.


717
0:27:38,74 --> 0:27:39,63
And I was like, what
does that mean?


718
0:27:39,63 --> 0:27:41,9
I backed up against the wall.


719
0:27:41,9 --> 0:27:43,78
I thought Navy SEALs were going
to burst out of the


720
0:27:43,78 --> 0:27:45,58
building and be like,
time to learn.


721
0:27:45,58 --> 0:27:49,26
And so, anyway, what she did
is, she went to her dresser


722
0:27:49,26 --> 0:27:51,9
and she got just a tiny little
vibrator, a wee little


723
0:27:51,9 --> 0:27:56,9
itsy-bitsy one, a tiny one like
you'd use on the bus,


724
0:27:56,9 --> 0:27:58,69
like nothing.


725
0:27:58,69 --> 0:28:0,92
So then we started messing
around again.


726
0:28:0,92 --> 0:28:3,2
And then she took it and touched
it to my surprisingly


727
0:28:3,2 --> 0:28:4,84
cute little butthole, and
then she went, push.


728
0:28:4,84 --> 0:28:10,32
And I immediately was like
throwing up, almost, sobbing,


729
0:28:10,32 --> 0:28:12,11
racked with sobs.


730
0:28:12,11 --> 0:28:14,23
So anyway, I get it.


731
0:28:14,23 --> 0:28:16,46
I understand that there are
people in the world who don't


732
0:28:16,46 --> 0:28:19,33
want a big hard penis going in
out of their butthole, and I'm


733
0:28:19,33 --> 0:28:19,95
among them.


734
0:28:19,95 --> 0:28:21,32
I am one of those people.


735
0:28:21,32 --> 0:28:24,94
So I'm just saying you're the
boss of your own butthole, OK?


736
0:28:24,94 --> 0:28:25,7
Remember that.


737
0:28:25,7 --> 0:28:30,136
So if your boyfriend is like,
it's Arbor Day, be like, N. So


738
0:28:30,136 --> 0:28:33,15
you don't have to let
him to do it.


739
0:28:33,15 --> 0:28:34,53
Look, if you want me to fuck
you in your butt, I'll fuck


740
0:28:34,53 --> 0:28:34,92
you in your butt.


741
0:28:34,92 --> 0:28:36,23
I'm not a monster.


742
0:28:36,23 --> 0:28:40,65
But I'm saying you're the
boss of your butt.


743
0:28:40,65 --> 0:28:42,75
You decide what goes in
and out of there.


744
0:28:42,75 --> 0:28:46,76



745
0:28:46,76 --> 0:28:49,7
Another thing for you youngsters
out there, that


746
0:28:49,7 --> 0:28:50,84
same older brother--


747
0:28:50,84 --> 0:28:52,66
the friend's older brother who
I called and had to get the


748
0:28:52,66 --> 0:28:55,61
coordinates for the cigar box
to dig up the porn-- he also


749
0:28:55,61 --> 0:28:57,28
taught us what blow jobs were.


750
0:28:57,28 --> 0:29:0,94
He didn't do a tutelage session,
but he mentioned that


751
0:29:0,94 --> 0:29:1,62
he got a blow job.


752
0:29:1,62 --> 0:29:2,49
And we were like, what's that?


753
0:29:2,49 --> 0:29:3,57
He's like, when the
penis goes.


754
0:29:3,57 --> 0:29:4,54
And I was like, shut up.


755
0:29:4,54 --> 0:29:5,4
I want one.


756
0:29:5,4 --> 0:29:10,97
And so anyway, he was like, yeah
but they got to swallow.


757
0:29:10,97 --> 0:29:11,72
They can't spit.


758
0:29:11,72 --> 0:29:13,25
And I was like, what
does that matter?


759
0:29:13,25 --> 0:29:15,6
And he was like, [GRUNTS].


760
0:29:15,6 --> 0:29:19,36
Anyway, decades later, finally
a Samaritan put my penis in


761
0:29:19,36 --> 0:29:21,28
her mouth, and I realized
that if you suck my


762
0:29:21,28 --> 0:29:22,94
dick, you're a hero.


763
0:29:22,94 --> 0:29:25,18
You can take it, you can spit
it in your hand, and you can


764
0:29:25,18 --> 0:29:29,17
break my jaw, and I will
drive to the florist--


765
0:29:29,17 --> 0:29:31,49
I'll get my jaw wired shut-- buy
you flowers, come, and be


766
0:29:31,49 --> 0:29:32,692
like, thank you so much.


767
0:29:32,692 --> 0:29:33,845
I love you.


768
0:29:33,845 --> 0:29:35,19
Spit, swallow, it's up to you.


769
0:29:35,19 --> 0:29:35,76
I don't care.


770
0:29:35,76 --> 0:29:38,5
I mean literally, you could suck
my dick, and then when


771
0:29:38,5 --> 0:29:40,9
you're done you could peel
off an expensive "Mission


772
0:29:40,9 --> 0:29:42,1
Impossible" style mask and
reveal that you're not a


773
0:29:42,1 --> 0:29:43,79
beautiful young woman, you're
Pat Sajak from "Wheel of


774
0:29:43,79 --> 0:29:46,26
Fortune." And I would
like, Pat, let


775
0:29:46,26 --> 0:29:47,28
me take you to brunch.


776
0:29:47,28 --> 0:29:48,0
I'm Rob Delaney.


777
0:29:48,0 --> 0:29:49,25
Thank you very much.


778
0:29:49,25 --> 0:29:51,704



779
0:29:51,704 --> 0:29:58,225
ROVE MCMANUS: Rob Delaney,
the king of regular


780
0:29:58,225 --> 0:29:59,6
penis-vagina sex.


781
0:29:59,6 --> 0:30:3,2



782
0:30:3,2 --> 0:30:5,96
Another thing I need to point
out to you is, when I first


783
0:30:5,96 --> 0:30:7,46
arrived here--


784
0:30:7,46 --> 0:30:9,81
I think this is going very
well tonight, by the way.


785
0:30:9,81 --> 0:30:11,9
Don't you think?


786
0:30:11,9 --> 0:30:16,75
It's really cool to get asked
to do something like this,


787
0:30:16,75 --> 0:30:19,97
especially because when I first
arrived here in Los


788
0:30:19,97 --> 0:30:22,89
Angeles, Hollywood itself, they
said if you want to make


789
0:30:22,89 --> 0:30:24,83
it in this town, you're
going to have to sleep


790
0:30:24,83 --> 0:30:27,1
your way to the top.


791
0:30:27,1 --> 0:30:29,32
I did that.


792
0:30:29,32 --> 0:30:32,44
But the problem was, no one
told me it had to be with


793
0:30:32,44 --> 0:30:37,68
someone in the industry who
can further your career.


794
0:30:37,68 --> 0:30:39,22
So I just ended up nailing some


795
0:30:39,22 --> 0:30:41,89
homeless guy in an alleyway.


796
0:30:41,89 --> 0:30:46,3
But to his credit, he said he
would put some calls in, so.


797
0:30:46,3 --> 0:30:49,17
Although, it was a banana he had
in his hand at the time.


798
0:30:49,17 --> 0:30:50,83
So anyway, the night
is still young.


799
0:30:50,83 --> 0:30:52,46
Fingers crossed.


800
0:30:52,46 --> 0:30:54,35
Ladies and gentlemen,
our next performer.


801
0:30:54,35 --> 0:30:57,78
Please welcome him now, one of
the best, Mr. Jeremy Hotz.


802
0:30:57,78 --> 0:31:4,35



803
0:31:4,35 --> 0:31:4,83
JEREMY HOTZ: Hi.


804
0:31:4,83 --> 0:31:6,15
Thank you.


805
0:31:6,15 --> 0:31:7,5
Thanks.


806
0:31:7,5 --> 0:31:8,87
OK, stop.


807
0:31:8,87 --> 0:31:11,68
Hi, how are you?


808
0:31:11,68 --> 0:31:14,74
This is my face.


809
0:31:14,74 --> 0:31:16,8
Sorry.


810
0:31:16,8 --> 0:31:19,96
It's just we can't all be good
looking, but I still have the


811
0:31:19,96 --> 0:31:23,69
odd sexual experience.


812
0:31:23,69 --> 0:31:26,421
This is my lucky shirt.


813
0:31:26,421 --> 0:31:27,49
Do you know what that means?


814
0:31:27,49 --> 0:31:30,54
I got laid while I was
wearing this shirt.


815
0:31:30,54 --> 0:31:32,86
And she loved this shirt because
when we were doing it,


816
0:31:32,86 --> 0:31:35,57
she said, whatever you do, don't
take off that shirt.


817
0:31:35,57 --> 0:31:40,5



818
0:31:40,5 --> 0:31:40,84
I like women.


819
0:31:40,84 --> 0:31:44,4
They're way better-looking
than us.


820
0:31:44,4 --> 0:31:44,53
They are.


821
0:31:44,53 --> 0:31:46,18
But everything in the
world's designed to


822
0:31:46,18 --> 0:31:47,4
make them even more.


823
0:31:47,4 --> 0:31:47,9
We can't compete.


824
0:31:47,9 --> 0:31:50,0
You're a good-looking guy, but
this is the best you're ever


825
0:31:50,0 --> 0:31:52,3
going to look.


826
0:31:52,3 --> 0:31:54,1
Look at her, man.


827
0:31:54,1 --> 0:31:56,315
Because women wear the makeup,
and they're already pretty.


828
0:31:56,315 --> 0:31:58,88
You can't wear makeup.


829
0:31:58,88 --> 0:32:0,5
Did you ever see a woman without
her makeup for the


830
0:32:0,5 --> 0:32:3,72
first time and just think,
who the fuck is that guy?


831
0:32:3,72 --> 0:32:10,6



832
0:32:10,6 --> 0:32:14,9
See, even the women have to
give me that one because


833
0:32:14,9 --> 0:32:16,79
they've all seen one of their
friends and thought, Jane's


834
0:32:16,79 --> 0:32:18,3
looking a lot like
Dave lately.


835
0:32:18,3 --> 0:32:19,55
This is ridiculous.


836
0:32:19,55 --> 0:32:21,84



837
0:32:21,84 --> 0:32:22,73
Women cheat, man.


838
0:32:22,73 --> 0:32:24,82
Their underwear is way
better than ours.


839
0:32:24,82 --> 0:32:25,69
It is.


840
0:32:25,69 --> 0:32:27,8
Are you a boob man
or an ass man?


841
0:32:27,8 --> 0:32:28,61
AUDIENCE: I like both.


842
0:32:28,61 --> 0:32:30,215
JEREMY HOTZ: You like both,
you greedy bastard?


843
0:32:30,215 --> 0:32:33,14



844
0:32:33,14 --> 0:32:36,13
Leave some for somebody else.


845
0:32:36,13 --> 0:32:39,1
He likes both.


846
0:32:39,1 --> 0:32:40,59
You ever been startled
by boobs?


847
0:32:40,59 --> 0:32:41,845
You've been fooled
haven't you?


848
0:32:41,845 --> 0:32:45,35
Oh yeah, because you see giant
boobs on a woman and then she


849
0:32:45,35 --> 0:32:48,16
takes off her bra and it's two
little gingerbread man eyes


850
0:32:48,16 --> 0:32:49,41
staring at you.


851
0:32:49,41 --> 0:32:51,91



852
0:32:51,91 --> 0:32:53,403
You think, shit,
I've been had.


853
0:32:53,403 --> 0:32:56,6



854
0:32:56,6 --> 0:32:57,4
It's true.


855
0:32:57,4 --> 0:32:59,31
Women have underwear
that fixes stuff.


856
0:32:59,31 --> 0:33:5,81
Victoria's Secret should
just be called "Lies."


857
0:33:5,81 --> 0:33:8,47
Our underwear is garbage,
isn't it?


858
0:33:8,47 --> 0:33:12,1
It comes with a fly for
no apparent reason.


859
0:33:12,1 --> 0:33:14,61
Ladies, we don't use the fly.


860
0:33:14,61 --> 0:33:16,96
We pull it down and flip
it over the top.


861
0:33:16,96 --> 0:33:21,21
And if we're at a urinal and
the guy next to us is using


862
0:33:21,21 --> 0:33:23,41
his fly, we punch him
in the fucking face.


863
0:33:23,41 --> 0:33:30,28



864
0:33:30,28 --> 0:33:32,3
But it's not all
gloom and doom.


865
0:33:32,3 --> 0:33:34,16
I'm just saying, ladies, if
you've got a guy that loves


866
0:33:34,16 --> 0:33:36,42
you, stay with him because
he's trying, isn't he?


867
0:33:36,42 --> 0:33:38,57
Seriously, it's gross, man.


868
0:33:38,57 --> 0:33:40,73
We know it's tough to be
a woman, it really is.


869
0:33:40,73 --> 0:33:41,72
You have the period.


870
0:33:41,72 --> 0:33:44,88
Good lord.


871
0:33:44,88 --> 0:33:45,94
You just bleed.


872
0:33:45,94 --> 0:33:47,91
You don't fall down
or nothing.


873
0:33:47,91 --> 0:33:49,16
It just happens.


874
0:33:49,16 --> 0:33:52,24



875
0:33:52,24 --> 0:33:55,5
But we didn't invent it, so quit
fucking yelling at us.


876
0:33:55,5 --> 0:34:5,12



877
0:34:5,12 --> 0:34:6,22
And we have balls.


878
0:34:6,22 --> 0:34:8,61
They're not particularly
attractive.


879
0:34:8,61 --> 0:34:11,56
Come on, ladies, you
don't like balls.


880
0:34:11,56 --> 0:34:12,5
You don't.


881
0:34:12,5 --> 0:34:16,0
You're like, I'll deal with that
long thing, but I don't


882
0:34:16,0 --> 0:34:18,54
want those bouncing all
over my forehead.


883
0:34:18,54 --> 0:34:22,54



884
0:34:22,54 --> 0:34:25,23
These are nasty, aren't they?


885
0:34:25,23 --> 0:34:27,13
If it was reversed, ladies,
and you had balls, you


886
0:34:27,13 --> 0:34:29,0
couldn't handle it.


887
0:34:29,0 --> 0:34:31,21
It'd be like carrying
a purse that never


888
0:34:31,21 --> 0:34:32,46
matched your outfit.


889
0:34:32,46 --> 0:34:35,51



890
0:34:35,51 --> 0:34:38,39
They're horrible.


891
0:34:38,39 --> 0:34:39,36
Do you know this, ladies?


892
0:34:39,36 --> 0:34:40,909
We have the unique ability
of being able to


893
0:34:40,909 --> 0:34:42,4
sit on our own balls.


894
0:34:42,4 --> 0:34:43,81
Do you know this?


895
0:34:43,81 --> 0:34:46,9
Your guy'll never
tell you that.


896
0:34:46,9 --> 0:34:47,995
You just see this look on his
face at a restaurant.


897
0:34:47,995 --> 0:34:53,699



898
0:34:53,699 --> 0:34:54,409
What happened?


899
0:34:54,409 --> 0:34:57,52
I don't want to talk about it.


900
0:34:57,52 --> 0:34:58,17
Tell me.


901
0:34:58,17 --> 0:35:2,21
I sat on my ball, are
you satisfied?


902
0:35:2,21 --> 0:35:3,36
Sat on your ball?


903
0:35:3,36 --> 0:35:5,426
That's ridiculous.


904
0:35:5,426 --> 0:35:7,78
How fucking uncoordinated
are you?


905
0:35:7,78 --> 0:35:13,3



906
0:35:13,3 --> 0:35:16,3
I'm just saying, they're
nasty, man.


907
0:35:16,3 --> 0:35:18,49
You gotta find the right person
who puts up with your


908
0:35:18,49 --> 0:35:19,6
bullshit, man.


909
0:35:19,6 --> 0:35:21,33
You can't live your whole
life by yourself.


910
0:35:21,33 --> 0:35:22,45
You don't want to die alone.


911
0:35:22,45 --> 0:35:24,82
Get a dog like I did, man.


912
0:35:24,82 --> 0:35:26,33
Seriously, check it out.


913
0:35:26,33 --> 0:35:27,86
Here he is.


914
0:35:27,86 --> 0:35:28,98
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


915
0:35:28,98 --> 0:35:29,89
He's 17.


916
0:35:29,89 --> 0:35:30,51
I rescued him.


917
0:35:30,51 --> 0:35:32,965
I got him out of someone's
backyard.


918
0:35:32,965 --> 0:35:37,92



919
0:35:37,92 --> 0:35:40,11
I just opened a fence, picked
him up, and ran


920
0:35:40,11 --> 0:35:42,49
away like an asshole.


921
0:35:42,49 --> 0:35:44,13
I took him to Petco
to be groomed.


922
0:35:44,13 --> 0:35:46,87
What a shit place that is.


923
0:35:46,87 --> 0:35:47,62
I said a trim.


924
0:35:47,62 --> 0:35:50,76
They shaved him almost
totally bald.


925
0:35:50,76 --> 0:35:53,95
He comes waddling out, I don't
even recognize him.


926
0:35:53,95 --> 0:35:56,87
But I took him because
he seemed to know me.


927
0:35:56,87 --> 0:35:59,57



928
0:35:59,57 --> 0:36:2,49
You know how embarrassing it
is walking a bald dog in my


929
0:36:2,49 --> 0:36:3,59
neighborhood?


930
0:36:3,59 --> 0:36:5,388
Cats try and fuck him.


931
0:36:5,388 --> 0:36:8,14



932
0:36:8,14 --> 0:36:9,23
I'm not a big cat guy.


933
0:36:9,23 --> 0:36:11,4
I don't like them.


934
0:36:11,4 --> 0:36:13,93
You never buy a cat, do you?


935
0:36:13,93 --> 0:36:18,59
They just show up on your stoop,
and you hear, [YOWLS].


936
0:36:18,59 --> 0:36:22,84
You're like maybe I
better let it in.


937
0:36:22,84 --> 0:36:27,41
Thus begins a 25 year commitment
with the most


938
0:36:27,41 --> 0:36:31,84
standoffish bullshit animal
on the face of the planet.


939
0:36:31,84 --> 0:36:32,925
You ever call your cat?


940
0:36:32,925 --> 0:36:36,3
Oh, yeah, they're right on it.


941
0:36:36,3 --> 0:36:39,88
They get up and walk in the
complete opposite direction,


942
0:36:39,88 --> 0:36:43,41
lift their tail, and show
you their asshole.


943
0:36:43,41 --> 0:36:45,8
How rude is that?


944
0:36:45,8 --> 0:36:49,9
I feed you, you miserable
animal.


945
0:36:49,9 --> 0:36:53,34
Don't flip me off with
your hole, gee.


946
0:36:53,34 --> 0:36:54,7
Just get a dog, man.


947
0:36:54,7 --> 0:36:55,71
Dogs are the best.


948
0:36:55,71 --> 0:36:57,96
He's 17 now, man, like I said.


949
0:36:57,96 --> 0:36:58,62
You never know.


950
0:36:58,62 --> 0:37:0,8
If you've got an old dog,
you don't know.


951
0:37:0,8 --> 0:37:1,75
They go old like your grandpa.


952
0:37:1,75 --> 0:37:4,28
Your grandpa's nuts, right?


953
0:37:4,28 --> 0:37:6,77
OK, let me explain it.


954
0:37:6,77 --> 0:37:10,6
You ever see your grandpa just
staring at the wall?


955
0:37:10,6 --> 0:37:14,87
Your mom comes downstairs and
goes, leave grandpa alone.


956
0:37:14,87 --> 0:37:16,895
The TV used to be
on that wall.


957
0:37:16,895 --> 0:37:19,99



958
0:37:19,99 --> 0:37:22,25
That's the way your dog is.


959
0:37:22,25 --> 0:37:24,21
He sleeps so soundly, man.


960
0:37:24,21 --> 0:37:26,9
I poke him, and if he opens his
eyes, I go, well, I guess


961
0:37:26,9 --> 0:37:29,71
we're going for a
walk right now.


962
0:37:29,71 --> 0:37:31,63
Because he's old, man.


963
0:37:31,63 --> 0:37:32,7
He's so old.


964
0:37:32,7 --> 0:37:34,84
But dogs are fantastic, man.


965
0:37:34,84 --> 0:37:37,62
Listen, honestly speaking,
are you guys dating?


966
0:37:37,62 --> 0:37:38,65
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.


967
0:37:38,65 --> 0:37:40,6
And you love her, right?


968
0:37:40,6 --> 0:37:41,95
Do you have a dog?


969
0:37:41,95 --> 0:37:41,5
AUDIENCE: We don't.


970
0:37:41,5 --> 0:37:42,8
JEREMY HOTZ: You don't.


971
0:37:42,8 --> 0:37:43,94
Man, have you ever had
a dog in your life?


972
0:37:43,94 --> 0:37:44,73
Yeah, yeah.


973
0:37:44,73 --> 0:37:47,54
Remember when you used to go
outside and the dog would lie


974
0:37:47,54 --> 0:37:50,5
by the door until you
fucking came home?


975
0:37:50,5 --> 0:37:52,23
She has never done that.


976
0:37:52,23 --> 0:37:57,21



977
0:37:57,21 --> 0:38:1,25
And if she does, get the hell
out of that relationship.


978
0:38:1,25 --> 0:38:1,96
You were great.


979
0:38:1,96 --> 0:38:3,21
Thank you so much.


980
0:38:3,21 --> 0:38:6,19



981
0:38:6,19 --> 0:38:7,44
CAT: Great to be here,
everybody.


982
0:38:7,44 --> 0:38:9,455
As you know, my name is
Professor Boyfriend.


983
0:38:9,455 --> 0:38:13,614



984
0:38:13,614 --> 0:38:14,58
Hey, what do you want?


985
0:38:14,58 --> 0:38:17,955
My owner's a lonely fat chick.


986
0:38:17,955 --> 0:38:19,2
Oh, what are you guys aww-ing?


987
0:38:19,2 --> 0:38:20,64
You're not the ones who have
to sit in her lap.


988
0:38:20,64 --> 0:38:25,8



989
0:38:25,8 --> 0:38:25,78
ROVE MCMANUS: Seriously,
you're all


990
0:38:25,78 --> 0:38:26,98
seeing that too, right?


991
0:38:26,98 --> 0:38:31,54
That's not just me just going,
wow, something just kicked in.


992
0:38:31,54 --> 0:38:35,22
I'm going to give a press
conference now.


993
0:38:35,22 --> 0:38:38,26
I'm hoping each performer, as
they come out now, are getting


994
0:38:38,26 --> 0:38:39,79
more and more--


995
0:38:39,79 --> 0:38:42,28
we've gone from microphones
to stands.


996
0:38:42,28 --> 0:38:44,49
The next person might
have a podium.


997
0:38:44,49 --> 0:38:45,81
And we just build a--


998
0:38:45,81 --> 0:38:46,46
I don't know what.


999
0:38:46,46 --> 0:38:50,59
Some huge-- it'll be like Best
Buy at the end of this, but


1000
0:38:50,59 --> 0:38:53,18
with people in here.


1001
0:38:53,18 --> 0:38:54,42
Aww, what?


1002
0:38:54,42 --> 0:38:56,2
Best Buy, what have they
done to anybody?


1003
0:38:56,2 --> 0:38:56,22
Nothing.


1004
0:38:56,22 --> 0:38:59,1
They've given us wonderful
audio-visual memories for


1005
0:38:59,1 --> 0:39:0,94
years, and then I just feel the
need to kick them for no


1006
0:39:0,94 --> 0:39:1,94
apparent reason.


1007
0:39:1,94 --> 0:39:2,94
Hey, look at that thing!


1008
0:39:2,94 --> 0:39:4,79
We're back.


1009
0:39:4,79 --> 0:39:7,62
Ladies and gentlemen, our next
performer, you may know him


1010
0:39:7,62 --> 0:39:10,5
from the wonderful sketch
group Dead Kevin.


1011
0:39:10,5 --> 0:39:13,8
Any Dead Kevin fans
in the house?


1012
0:39:13,8 --> 0:39:16,22
Even just fans of people who
hate a guy called Kevin and


1013
0:39:16,22 --> 0:39:18,61
love that idea, ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome


1014
0:39:18,61 --> 0:39:19,86
Ahmed Bharoocha.


1015
0:39:19,86 --> 0:39:30,16



1016
0:39:30,16 --> 0:39:30,63
AHMED BHAROOCHA: Thanks, guys.


1017
0:39:30,63 --> 0:39:32,235
Keep it going for
Rove, everybody.


1018
0:39:32,235 --> 0:39:36,26



1019
0:39:36,26 --> 0:39:40,204
He took the mic stand back.


1020
0:39:40,204 --> 0:39:42,14
It's BYO mic stand.


1021
0:39:42,14 --> 0:39:44,64



1022
0:39:44,64 --> 0:39:45,46
This is crazy.


1023
0:39:45,46 --> 0:39:48,1
YouTube is becoming like
television now.


1024
0:39:48,1 --> 0:39:50,43
The only difference is, they
still give the opportunity to


1025
0:39:50,43 --> 0:39:53,67
the viewer at home to attach
their hateful thoughts to the


1026
0:39:53,67 --> 0:39:56,78
bottom of this video.


1027
0:39:56,78 --> 0:39:59,34
Parents, read your children's
YouTube comments.


1028
0:39:59,34 --> 0:40:2,21



1029
0:40:2,21 --> 0:40:6,68
Recently, I went to a bar and
I went to the bathroom.


1030
0:40:6,68 --> 0:40:9,43
In the bathroom, they
had two urinals.


1031
0:40:9,43 --> 0:40:13,99
One of the urinals was filled
with ice, which I thought was


1032
0:40:13,99 --> 0:40:18,93
kind of weird, so I went
to the other urinal.


1033
0:40:18,93 --> 0:40:23,27
And as I was going to the
bathroom, I started


1034
0:40:23,27 --> 0:40:26,82
looking at that ice.


1035
0:40:26,82 --> 0:40:29,12
I was like, hmm.


1036
0:40:29,12 --> 0:40:31,1
It would be really fun
to melt that ice.


1037
0:40:31,1 --> 0:40:34,33



1038
0:40:34,33 --> 0:40:38,12
So I stopped myself, went over
to the other urinal, and I


1039
0:40:38,12 --> 0:40:39,14
started melting the ice.


1040
0:40:39,14 --> 0:40:43,84
And I thought I was alone, but
a voice just comes from the


1041
0:40:43,84 --> 0:40:46,97
stall and he's like, couldn't
resist the ice, could you?


1042
0:40:46,97 --> 0:40:51,3



1043
0:40:51,3 --> 0:40:53,27
I was like, who is that?


1044
0:40:53,27 --> 0:40:55,5
What kind of perverted
science experiment


1045
0:40:55,5 --> 0:40:57,53
did I just walk into?


1046
0:40:57,53 --> 0:40:58,99
He's like, that's
three for ice.


1047
0:40:58,99 --> 0:41:1,61



1048
0:41:1,61 --> 0:41:4,88
I feel like it's not cool
to like things anymore.


1049
0:41:4,88 --> 0:41:6,245
You can't enjoy anything.


1050
0:41:6,245 --> 0:41:9,92
You have to like everything
ironically or hate it.


1051
0:41:9,92 --> 0:41:13,27
The cool people, like hipsters,
hipsters have become


1052
0:41:13,27 --> 0:41:15,1
the two old guys from
the Muppets.


1053
0:41:15,1 --> 0:41:18,15



1054
0:41:18,15 --> 0:41:21,69
At first glance, you're like,
wow, these guys really hate


1055
0:41:21,69 --> 0:41:23,3
the Muppets.


1056
0:41:23,3 --> 0:41:26,79
But then on closer inspection,
you're like, hey, these guys


1057
0:41:26,79 --> 0:41:30,15
bought season tickets
to the Muppets.


1058
0:41:30,15 --> 0:41:33,74
They keep coming back.


1059
0:41:33,74 --> 0:41:33,932
[IMPERSONATING STATLER
AND WALDORF]


1060
0:41:33,932 --> 0:41:34,85
Why do we keep coming here?


1061
0:41:34,85 --> 0:41:36,1
Because we're dead inside.


1062
0:41:36,1 --> 0:41:40,46



1063
0:41:40,46 --> 0:41:41,87
I basically grew up
in your typical


1064
0:41:41,87 --> 0:41:43,775
all-American household.


1065
0:41:43,775 --> 0:41:46,59
My mother's an Irish Catholic
woman, my father is a


1066
0:41:46,59 --> 0:41:47,84
Pakistani Muslim.


1067
0:41:47,84 --> 0:41:52,7



1068
0:41:52,7 --> 0:41:55,29
See you guys later.


1069
0:41:55,29 --> 0:42:0,61
You know, baseball, apple pie,
gulab jamun, things like that.


1070
0:42:0,61 --> 0:42:2,955
A lot of people ask if my
parents fought because of


1071
0:42:2,955 --> 0:42:4,71
their religions, different
religions.


1072
0:42:4,71 --> 0:42:6,5
They didn't fight because
they loved each other.


1073
0:42:6,5 --> 0:42:8,74
It's crazy to fight
over religion.


1074
0:42:8,74 --> 0:42:10,46
You can't prove who's right.


1075
0:42:10,46 --> 0:42:12,825
Every religion has the
same credentials.


1076
0:42:12,825 --> 0:42:14,38
It's like, how do you know
your religion's right?


1077
0:42:14,38 --> 0:42:15,39
Oh, it says it in this book.


1078
0:42:15,39 --> 0:42:16,3
But it says it in my book.


1079
0:42:16,3 --> 0:42:19,68
Yeah, but my book says
your book's not true.


1080
0:42:19,68 --> 0:42:22,49
So does my book.


1081
0:42:22,49 --> 0:42:23,98
But my dad told me
my book was true.


1082
0:42:23,98 --> 0:42:26,72
But so did my dad.


1083
0:42:26,72 --> 0:42:28,32
It's just a guess,
just a guess.


1084
0:42:28,32 --> 0:42:31,37
But it's the only guess
that people will


1085
0:42:31,37 --> 0:42:33,63
murder each other over.


1086
0:42:33,63 --> 0:42:36,14
There's no one killing each
other over how many jelly


1087
0:42:36,14 --> 0:42:38,81
beans are in a jar.


1088
0:42:38,81 --> 0:42:39,95
We say it's 67.


1089
0:42:39,95 --> 0:42:41,28
We say it's 87.


1090
0:42:41,28 --> 0:42:42,31
52.


1091
0:42:42,31 --> 0:42:44,59
It's all part of the
same jelly bean.


1092
0:42:44,59 --> 0:42:48,594
We think the jelly bean
hates gay people.


1093
0:42:48,594 --> 0:42:49,72
There is no jelly bean.


1094
0:42:49,72 --> 0:42:50,72
There might be a jelly bean.


1095
0:42:50,72 --> 0:42:52,24
I'm a jelly bean.


1096
0:42:52,24 --> 0:42:54,72
Let's kill him.


1097
0:42:54,72 --> 0:42:56,2
We're all jelly beans.


1098
0:42:56,2 --> 0:42:58,77
Let's kill ourselves.


1099
0:42:58,77 --> 0:42:59,91
I think the jelly
bean's a woman.


1100
0:42:59,91 --> 0:43:0,46
That's ridiculous.


1101
0:43:0,46 --> 0:43:0,66
Who said that?


1102
0:43:0,66 --> 0:43:1,91
Yeah, shut the hell up.


1103
0:43:1,91 --> 0:43:4,64



1104
0:43:4,64 --> 0:43:6,165
I found out that there's
people that


1105
0:43:6,165 --> 0:43:8,74
don't believe in dinosaurs.


1106
0:43:8,74 --> 0:43:13,15
They think that the devil put
dinosaur bones in the


1107
0:43:13,15 --> 0:43:16,3
earth to trick us.


1108
0:43:16,3 --> 0:43:19,395



1109
0:43:19,395 --> 0:43:27,46
That is the lamest, nerdiest
devil ever.


1110
0:43:27,46 --> 0:43:30,36
Is this just some science
fiction nerd devil?


1111
0:43:30,36 --> 0:43:31,35
Like, hey Lucifer.


1112
0:43:31,35 --> 0:43:33,2
What's on the agenda
for tonight?


1113
0:43:33,2 --> 0:43:36,63
Murder, genocide, plague?


1114
0:43:36,63 --> 0:43:37,88
Ah, no.


1115
0:43:37,88 --> 0:43:40,94



1116
0:43:40,94 --> 0:43:44,64
Actually a much more
diabolical scheme.


1117
0:43:44,64 --> 0:43:48,71
I've created a prehistoric
reptilian species.


1118
0:43:48,71 --> 0:43:51,6
I'm going to take their bones
and bury them deep down in the


1119
0:43:51,6 --> 0:43:54,26
earth, as to suggest
an alternate


1120
0:43:54,26 --> 0:43:57,81
timeline than in the Bible.


1121
0:43:57,81 --> 0:44:5,27
And then we'll hope that one
day, someone comes along, digs


1122
0:44:5,27 --> 0:44:8,602
them up, and questions
God's existence.


1123
0:44:8,602 --> 0:44:11,488



1124
0:44:11,488 --> 0:44:12,738
Huh?


1125
0:44:12,738 --> 0:44:15,35



1126
0:44:15,35 --> 0:44:19,43
And if that doesn't work,
we still have the gays.


1127
0:44:19,43 --> 0:44:20,45
Hey, guys, you've
been fantastic.


1128
0:44:20,45 --> 0:44:21,7
Thank you very much.


1129
0:44:21,7 --> 0:44:30,82



1130
0:44:30,82 --> 0:44:32,4
ROVE MCMANUS: Another round of
applause for Ahmed, everybody.


1131
0:44:32,4 --> 0:44:33,54
I'm collecting the set.


1132
0:44:33,54 --> 0:44:34,79
I'm collecting the set.


1133
0:44:34,79 --> 0:44:38,55



1134
0:44:38,55 --> 0:44:43,9
Seriously, one day, we will look
back at this moment when


1135
0:44:43,9 --> 0:44:46,6
there are no microphones left
in the world, and I'll be


1136
0:44:46,6 --> 0:44:50,5
sitting here laughing, going,
they all said I was mad!


1137
0:44:50,5 --> 0:44:51,89
Who is laughing now?


1138
0:44:51,89 --> 0:44:54,93
Me, with my booming voice!


1139
0:44:54,93 --> 0:44:57,155
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
indeed a pleasure to welcome


1140
0:44:57,155 --> 0:44:58,79
our next performer
on the stage.


1141
0:44:58,79 --> 0:45:1,95
Not only a very gifted stand-up
comedian, but one of


1142
0:45:1,95 --> 0:45:4,21
the stars of one of my favorite
shows on television,


1143
0:45:4,21 --> 0:45:6,14
"Parks and Recreation."
Ladies and gentlemen,


1144
0:45:6,14 --> 0:45:7,5
give it up for Retta.


1145
0:45:7,5 --> 0:45:20,25



1146
0:45:20,25 --> 0:45:23,19
RETTA: Hi.


1147
0:45:23,19 --> 0:45:26,77
How's everybody doing?


1148
0:45:26,77 --> 0:45:30,31
So I'm the black girl.


1149
0:45:30,31 --> 0:45:32,912
It's OK, I'm used to it.


1150
0:45:32,912 --> 0:45:36,7
I've been this way a
long fucking time.


1151
0:45:36,7 --> 0:45:40,7
So I'm here to talk
about race.


1152
0:45:40,7 --> 0:45:40,755
That's cool.


1153
0:45:40,755 --> 0:45:43,26
We're all a little racist.


1154
0:45:43,26 --> 0:45:46,17
What I can't stand is when
people are boldly racist.


1155
0:45:46,17 --> 0:45:49,76
I prefer old school racism,
where you talk shit about me


1156
0:45:49,76 --> 0:45:53,4
behind my back or behind
closed doors.


1157
0:45:53,4 --> 0:45:56,5
Now, old school racism is
not to be confused with


1158
0:45:56,5 --> 0:45:59,36
old-fashioned racism, OK?


1159
0:45:59,36 --> 0:46:2,25
These are two very
different things.


1160
0:46:2,25 --> 0:46:6,725
Old school racism is passive,
while old-fashioned racism, a


1161
0:46:6,725 --> 0:46:8,9
lot more aggressive.


1162
0:46:8,9 --> 0:46:9,28
A lot more in your face.


1163
0:46:9,28 --> 0:46:11,79
It was all the rage in the
'50s and '60s with its


1164
0:46:11,79 --> 0:46:15,67
high-powered fire hoses and
its public hangings.


1165
0:46:15,67 --> 0:46:16,21
Yeah.


1166
0:46:16,21 --> 0:46:18,66
That's the kind of racism I
don't prefer because, quite


1167
0:46:18,66 --> 0:46:20,8
frankly, I don't like
to get my hair wet.


1168
0:46:20,8 --> 0:46:22,76



1169
0:46:22,76 --> 0:46:26,76
So I accept that we're all a
little racist, and I include


1170
0:46:26,76 --> 0:46:27,61
myself in that.


1171
0:46:27,61 --> 0:46:31,54
I still make generalizations
about you people.


1172
0:46:31,54 --> 0:46:34,7
For example, I still believe
that white people can't really


1173
0:46:34,7 --> 0:46:40,11
feel cold, which is why you can
wear shorts and flip-flops


1174
0:46:40,11 --> 0:46:42,58
in 40 degree weather.


1175
0:46:42,58 --> 0:46:46,51
As a black woman who turns on
her heat in September, I find


1176
0:46:46,51 --> 0:46:48,77
this to be a bit peculiar.


1177
0:46:48,77 --> 0:46:54,52
But as an old school racist,
I keep that shit to myself.


1178
0:46:54,52 --> 0:46:59,97
It's only during high-stress
situations that I find that my


1179
0:46:59,97 --> 0:47:1,64
racism rears its ugly head.


1180
0:47:1,64 --> 0:47:5,1
Like when I've been in line at
the DMV for an hour and the


1181
0:47:5,1 --> 0:47:8,52
blonde in front of me insists
on flipping her hair forward


1182
0:47:8,52 --> 0:47:11,77
and back, forward and back until
it brushes across my


1183
0:47:11,77 --> 0:47:15,1
face and sticks to
my lip gloss.


1184
0:47:15,1 --> 0:47:18,26
That is a situation where a
white girl might find herself


1185
0:47:18,26 --> 0:47:19,89
getting snatched by
a black woman.


1186
0:47:19,89 --> 0:47:23,28



1187
0:47:23,28 --> 0:47:27,9
Or at the airport when the
ticket agent announces that


1188
0:47:27,9 --> 0:47:30,53
they will begin boarding first
class and the executive


1189
0:47:30,53 --> 0:47:33,51
platinum frequent flyer business
traveler bumps and


1190
0:47:33,51 --> 0:47:36,95
pushes past me because he
assumes I'm flying animal


1191
0:47:36,95 --> 0:47:39,89
class with rest of the plebs.


1192
0:47:39,89 --> 0:47:42,46
Excuse you, John J McAllister
the Third.


1193
0:47:42,46 --> 0:47:44,91
I'm assigned to seat
2D, bitch.


1194
0:47:44,91 --> 0:47:46,16
Recognize.


1195
0:47:46,16 --> 0:47:53,91



1196
0:47:53,91 --> 0:47:59,14
But my racism is most evident
when I'm driving because I


1197
0:47:59,14 --> 0:48:3,31
have an obscene and unrelenting
case of road rage.


1198
0:48:3,31 --> 0:48:7,15
I am what you might call a
psycho bitch behind the wheel,


1199
0:48:7,15 --> 0:48:9,6
who's also a little racist.


1200
0:48:9,6 --> 0:48:12,0
But I'm here to tell you that
it is a new-- what-- fucking


1201
0:48:12,0 --> 0:48:12,64
day, people.


1202
0:48:12,64 --> 0:48:15,53
It is a new fucking day.


1203
0:48:15,53 --> 0:48:18,33
Because I was in my car,
headed towards a light,


1204
0:48:18,33 --> 0:48:19,86
towards an intersection.


1205
0:48:19,86 --> 0:48:22,51
Now, there's another young
lady headed towards--


1206
0:48:22,51 --> 0:48:24,43
I'm traveling east to west.


1207
0:48:24,43 --> 0:48:25,92
She's traveling north
to south.


1208
0:48:25,92 --> 0:48:29,29
Now she, too, would like
to move east to west.


1209
0:48:29,29 --> 0:48:33,37
So my light is about to turn
yellow, so all she has to do


1210
0:48:33,37 --> 0:48:36,69
is wait 10 seconds for
the right of way.


1211
0:48:36,69 --> 0:48:40,72
But instead of waiting the 10
seconds for her rightful turn,


1212
0:48:40,72 --> 0:48:44,24
she takes it upon herself to
risk my life and property by


1213
0:48:44,24 --> 0:48:47,77
gunning it and making the
turn just as I enter the


1214
0:48:47,77 --> 0:48:49,8
intersection.


1215
0:48:49,8 --> 0:48:52,13
This little entitled bitch--


1216
0:48:52,13 --> 0:48:53,39
I think at this point
we all know what


1217
0:48:53,39 --> 0:48:55,5
I was really thinking--


1218
0:48:55,5 --> 0:48:59,21
this little entitled white
bitch cuts me off.


1219
0:48:59,21 --> 0:49:2,27
So I immediately go to my "angry
black woman who has no


1220
0:49:2,27 --> 0:49:5,74
patience for entitled white
bitches" place, right?


1221
0:49:5,74 --> 0:49:8,84
So now I'm about to gun it so I
can pull up next to her and


1222
0:49:8,84 --> 0:49:10,645
give her the "bitch, do you know
who the fuck you just cut


1223
0:49:10,645 --> 0:49:13,95
off?" face, right?


1224
0:49:13,95 --> 0:49:15,84



1225
0:49:15,84 --> 0:49:20,79
I am looking to intimidate the
shit out of her when I notice


1226
0:49:20,79 --> 0:49:25,12
that she's got an Obama hope
sticker on her bumper.


1227
0:49:25,12 --> 0:49:27,34
And that's when I said,
you know what?


1228
0:49:27,34 --> 0:49:28,59
I'm going to let this one go.


1229
0:49:28,59 --> 0:49:31,707



1230
0:49:31,707 --> 0:49:32,957
Yeah.


1231
0:49:32,957 --> 0:49:35,144



1232
0:49:35,144 --> 0:49:38,2
I'm going to give you a pass on
this one, Marcy, because it


1233
0:49:38,2 --> 0:49:40,58
is a new-- what-- fucking day.


1234
0:49:40,58 --> 0:49:42,33
Just know that this type of shit
did not fly during the


1235
0:49:42,33 --> 0:49:43,85
Bush administration.


1236
0:49:43,85 --> 0:49:46,46
Yeah, I'd have lit
your ass up.


1237
0:49:46,46 --> 0:49:48,735
Know this.


1238
0:49:48,735 --> 0:49:52,21
Because normally I'd want to
strangle this trick, but it


1239
0:49:52,21 --> 0:49:54,97
was the Obama hope sticker that
convinced me to Barack


1240
0:49:54,97 --> 0:49:56,95
the choke and let
that bitch go.


1241
0:49:56,95 --> 0:49:57,788
That's my time.


1242
0:49:57,788 --> 0:50:1,204
Thank you guys for
paying attention.


1243
0:50:1,204 --> 0:50:2,454
ROVE MCMANUS: To Retta.


1244
0:50:2,454 --> 0:50:6,14



1245
0:50:6,14 --> 0:50:8,23
Oh, she's going to take it.


1246
0:50:8,23 --> 0:50:9,77
That's professional.


1247
0:50:9,77 --> 0:50:10,97
That's professional.


1248
0:50:10,97 --> 0:50:14,42
Let any aspiring comics out
there, either in the room or


1249
0:50:14,42 --> 0:50:16,56
watching this at home right
now, whenever you leave


1250
0:50:16,56 --> 0:50:18,82
anywhere, take your microphone
stand with you.


1251
0:50:18,82 --> 0:50:20,68
What were you doing with a
microphone stand there the


1252
0:50:20,68 --> 0:50:22,3
first place?


1253
0:50:22,3 --> 0:50:23,89
You need to question
your attitude.


1254
0:50:23,89 --> 0:50:26,74
Ladies and gentlemen, our
final performer of the


1255
0:50:26,74 --> 0:50:29,6
evening, are you ready?


1256
0:50:29,6 --> 0:50:31,29
Are you ready?


1257
0:50:31,29 --> 0:50:34,262
Oh my god, one of my favorites,
the host of one of


1258
0:50:34,262 --> 0:50:36,76
my favorite podcasts, "Walking
the Room," ladies and


1259
0:50:36,76 --> 0:50:38,625
gentlemen, Greg Behrendt.


1260
0:50:38,625 --> 0:50:46,886



1261
0:50:46,886 --> 0:50:48,706
GREG BEHRENDT: Hello,
hello, hello, hello.


1262
0:50:48,706 --> 0:50:50,34
Nice to see you.


1263
0:50:50,34 --> 0:50:53,56
Wow, this is exciting, guys.


1264
0:50:53,56 --> 0:50:56,9
Top line in the old YouTube
show, shit, at 50?


1265
0:50:56,9 --> 0:50:56,97
That shit is awesome.


1266
0:50:56,97 --> 0:50:58,25
Yeah, I'm 50 years old.


1267
0:50:58,25 --> 0:50:58,77
Well, you look awesome.


1268
0:50:58,77 --> 0:51:1,976
Yeah, I fucking iron my neck.


1269
0:51:1,976 --> 0:51:4,42
I look amazing, man.


1270
0:51:4,42 --> 0:51:4,995
I've had a pretty good career.


1271
0:51:4,995 --> 0:51:5,95
I've made some mistakes.


1272
0:51:5,95 --> 0:51:6,55
I'm not going to lie to you.


1273
0:51:6,55 --> 0:51:7,58
I had an audition for "Saturday


1274
0:51:7,58 --> 0:51:8,45
Night Live" years ago.


1275
0:51:8,45 --> 0:51:9,76
When I say audition,
it didn't happen.


1276
0:51:9,76 --> 0:51:14,4
I was standing outside 30 Rock
doing an imitation that I do.


1277
0:51:14,4 --> 0:51:15,86
I do voices, I do characters.


1278
0:51:15,86 --> 0:51:16,12
Yeah.


1279
0:51:16,12 --> 0:51:18,58
I've hid that, but I do them.


1280
0:51:18,58 --> 0:51:20,77
I do characters pretty
good, Bill Cosby


1281
0:51:20,77 --> 0:51:22,2
explaining the Holocaust.


1282
0:51:22,2 --> 0:51:25,4



1283
0:51:25,4 --> 0:51:26,75
They put the Jews
on the train.


1284
0:51:26,75 --> 0:51:30,6
Like, it's not a great
imitation, but HoloCosby is an


1285
0:51:30,6 --> 0:51:31,85
awesome t-shirt.


1286
0:51:31,85 --> 0:51:35,98



1287
0:51:35,98 --> 0:51:38,52
I'm going to make that t-shirt
later, if I feel like it, put


1288
0:51:38,52 --> 0:51:41,6
that little Michael Jordan
mustache on him.


1289
0:51:41,6 --> 0:51:42,46
He's got the patent
on that now.


1290
0:51:42,46 --> 0:51:43,835
How are you guys?


1291
0:51:43,835 --> 0:51:44,61
This is really--


1292
0:51:44,61 --> 0:51:45,576
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]


1293
0:51:45,576 --> 0:51:47,991
GREG BEHRENDT: I mean,
it's dope.


1294
0:51:47,991 --> 0:51:51,49



1295
0:51:51,49 --> 0:51:52,725
This is exciting.


1296
0:51:52,725 --> 0:51:53,64
I've had a pretty good life.


1297
0:51:53,64 --> 0:51:54,52
I have a family.


1298
0:51:54,52 --> 0:51:56,14
I've got a beautiful--


1299
0:51:56,14 --> 0:51:59,8
two daughters, beautiful.


1300
0:51:59,8 --> 0:52:2,24
One of them's nice, daughters.


1301
0:52:2,24 --> 0:52:4,5
Not nice, they're both nice,
just one likes me.


1302
0:52:4,5 --> 0:52:5,5
The other one doesn't like--


1303
0:52:5,5 --> 0:52:5,91
the younger.


1304
0:52:5,91 --> 0:52:7,1
The older one likes me.


1305
0:52:7,1 --> 0:52:8,13
11, she likes me.


1306
0:52:8,13 --> 0:52:10,23
The older daughter
likes me a lot.


1307
0:52:10,23 --> 0:52:12,13
Like, she thinks I'm
the sun and moon.


1308
0:52:12,13 --> 0:52:13,16
She really--


1309
0:52:13,16 --> 0:52:14,65
well, she's not a
genius, either.


1310
0:52:14,65 --> 0:52:16,56
She's not a bright person.


1311
0:52:16,56 --> 0:52:18,41
Doesn't make her a bad person,
she's just not a genius.


1312
0:52:18,41 --> 0:52:21,46
As a parent, I wouldn't be a
good guy if I pretended she


1313
0:52:21,46 --> 0:52:22,6
was smarter.


1314
0:52:22,6 --> 0:52:23,85
She's going to be the president
of nothing.


1315
0:52:23,85 --> 0:52:25,28
That doesn't make her not--


1316
0:52:25,28 --> 0:52:26,3
she's lovely.


1317
0:52:26,3 --> 0:52:27,8
She's a lovely person.


1318
0:52:27,8 --> 0:52:28,62
Do you know what she wanted
for her 11th birthday?


1319
0:52:28,62 --> 0:52:29,47
You know what's at the
top of her list?


1320
0:52:29,47 --> 0:52:31,71
She wanted a hug.


1321
0:52:31,71 --> 0:52:32,19
How about that?


1322
0:52:32,19 --> 0:52:33,3
You know what her second
favorite thing in


1323
0:52:33,3 --> 0:52:33,91
the whole world is?


1324
0:52:33,91 --> 0:52:34,48
Cartwheels.


1325
0:52:34,48 --> 0:52:36,51
If she could cartwheel
into a hug, she


1326
0:52:36,51 --> 0:52:37,76
would turn into a rainbow.


1327
0:52:37,76 --> 0:52:40,52



1328
0:52:40,52 --> 0:52:41,92
She's just not a genius,
that's all.


1329
0:52:41,92 --> 0:52:42,9
She's not a thinker,
that's all.


1330
0:52:42,9 --> 0:52:45,0
She's just not a person who
puts things together.


1331
0:52:45,0 --> 0:52:46,38
Let me give you an example, just
so you don't think I'm


1332
0:52:46,38 --> 0:52:48,8
being a dick.


1333
0:52:48,8 --> 0:52:49,92
We're on an airplane.


1334
0:52:49,92 --> 0:52:51,95
She has a 7-Up in a can.


1335
0:52:51,95 --> 0:52:53,88
Flight attendant comes over and
says, would you like to


1336
0:52:53,88 --> 0:52:55,5
have a cup of ice with that?


1337
0:52:55,5 --> 0:52:56,32
She says, yes, I would.


1338
0:52:56,32 --> 0:52:58,27
Flight attendant puts
down a cup of ice.


1339
0:52:58,27 --> 0:53:1,35
My daughter looks at the cup,
looks at the can, and


1340
0:53:1,35 --> 0:53:2,53
takes a cube and--


1341
0:53:2,53 --> 0:53:3,98
she's really pretty.


1342
0:53:3,98 --> 0:53:5,55
Like, she's super--


1343
0:53:5,55 --> 0:53:6,98
she's gorgeous.


1344
0:53:6,98 --> 0:53:9,135
She's a very, very pretty--
she's just not a thinker.


1345
0:53:9,135 --> 0:53:11,73



1346
0:53:11,73 --> 0:53:13,38
Now let me explain my
younger one to you.


1347
0:53:13,38 --> 0:53:15,45
She's more complex.


1348
0:53:15,45 --> 0:53:17,56
She's seven.


1349
0:53:17,56 --> 0:53:21,7
She has an imaginary friend
that hates her.


1350
0:53:21,7 --> 0:53:23,78



1351
0:53:23,78 --> 0:53:24,88
Hang on.


1352
0:53:24,88 --> 0:53:28,8
And she don't give a fuck.


1353
0:53:28,8 --> 0:53:29,8
How weird is that?


1354
0:53:29,8 --> 0:53:32,28
She has a friend that she made
up with her mind that


1355
0:53:32,28 --> 0:53:32,8
doesn't like her.


1356
0:53:32,8 --> 0:53:34,7
And she's like, go
fuck yourself.


1357
0:53:34,7 --> 0:53:38,91
She already knows human beings
are going to be disappointing.


1358
0:53:38,91 --> 0:53:40,35
She was walking through the
house the other day on an


1359
0:53:40,35 --> 0:53:41,66
imaginary phone like
this, not talking.


1360
0:53:41,66 --> 0:53:42,64
I go, what are you doing?


1361
0:53:42,64 --> 0:53:44,23
She goes, I'm on hold.


1362
0:53:44,23 --> 0:53:45,865
That's weird.


1363
0:53:45,865 --> 0:53:52,5



1364
0:53:52,5 --> 0:53:53,625
And the other one is really--


1365
0:53:53,625 --> 0:53:55,36
I'm not comparing them because
they're both lovely.


1366
0:53:55,36 --> 0:53:56,6
They're both beautiful.


1367
0:53:56,6 --> 0:53:58,57
But the other one sort of fell
out of my wife's vagina with


1368
0:53:58,57 --> 0:54:2,2
big brown hair and beestung
lips and beautiful eyes.


1369
0:54:2,2 --> 0:54:4,72
And the little one came out with
the-- you know like when


1370
0:54:4,72 --> 0:54:5,81
the babies have hair--


1371
0:54:5,81 --> 0:54:7,67
barely any, like you've got to
push all three together and


1372
0:54:7,67 --> 0:54:8,64
put a bow in it so
that everyone


1373
0:54:8,64 --> 0:54:10,18
knows, oh, it's a chick.


1374
0:54:10,18 --> 0:54:11,6
Like, it's not a chick, but
you have to do that.


1375
0:54:11,6 --> 0:54:14,4
And then she has no depth
perception, so she had to have


1376
0:54:14,4 --> 0:54:15,1
these glasses.


1377
0:54:15,1 --> 0:54:18,39
And then all of her teeth came
through one hole at the front,


1378
0:54:18,39 --> 0:54:19,846
so she has to have this thing
called an expander where you


1379
0:54:19,846 --> 0:54:21,5
have to twist--


1380
0:54:21,5 --> 0:54:23,23
it's like an iron maiden
for your mouth.


1381
0:54:23,23 --> 0:54:25,69
And you put a key in there and
turn it at night so that her


1382
0:54:25,69 --> 0:54:26,37
teeth spread.


1383
0:54:26,37 --> 0:54:28,39
And then we've given
her a lisp.


1384
0:54:28,39 --> 0:54:31,145
She didn't have a lisp, but we
put plastic in our mouth so


1385
0:54:31,145 --> 0:54:32,24
now she talks.


1386
0:54:32,24 --> 0:54:34,21
It just has to be like this,
she doesn't have a choice.


1387
0:54:34,21 --> 0:54:37,5
And then when she's done
talking, she has to go and


1388
0:54:37,5 --> 0:54:39,21
suck it back in because her
mouth is filled with spit.


1389
0:54:39,21 --> 0:54:39,97
How about that?


1390
0:54:39,97 --> 0:54:40,65
Seven.


1391
0:54:40,65 --> 0:54:43,5
Maybe she's cynical.


1392
0:54:43,5 --> 0:54:44,61
She's kind of a punk.


1393
0:54:44,61 --> 0:54:45,46
I walked past her room
the other day.


1394
0:54:45,46 --> 0:54:47,5
She was talking to her friend,
telling what I did for living,


1395
0:54:47,5 --> 0:54:48,82
and she goes, yeah, I
think he's a clown.


1396
0:54:48,82 --> 0:54:52,99
First off, you're right.


1397
0:54:52,99 --> 0:54:56,2



1398
0:54:56,2 --> 0:54:57,24
But they take care
of each other.


1399
0:54:57,24 --> 0:55:0,11
That's the kind of cool thing,
because the older one, she's


1400
0:55:0,11 --> 0:55:1,3
excited by outside.


1401
0:55:1,3 --> 0:55:3,35
Like, oh my god, outdoors.


1402
0:55:3,35 --> 0:55:4,88
Everything is exciting to her.


1403
0:55:4,88 --> 0:55:7,36
And the younger one
is cynical.


1404
0:55:7,36 --> 0:55:9,52
They'll date at some point,
which will be exciting but


1405
0:55:9,52 --> 0:55:10,4
weird at the same time.


1406
0:55:10,4 --> 0:55:11,69
Because I live in a house
with just girls.


1407
0:55:11,69 --> 0:55:14,27
There's just nothing but
vagina at my house.


1408
0:55:14,27 --> 0:55:14,98
I don't have it in boxes.


1409
0:55:14,98 --> 0:55:18,2
What I'm saying is that
there's a lot


1410
0:55:18,2 --> 0:55:20,256
of women in my house.


1411
0:55:20,256 --> 0:55:22,233
And I'll probably be psyched
when they start dating, you


1412
0:55:22,233 --> 0:55:22,63
know what I mean?


1413
0:55:22,63 --> 0:55:24,63
I'll probably freak the dude
out that comes over because


1414
0:55:24,63 --> 0:55:26,457
I'll be excited there's
a man in the house, do


1415
0:55:26,457 --> 0:55:28,0
you know what I mean?


1416
0:55:28,0 --> 0:55:29,91
He'll knock on the door
with his fucking face.


1417
0:55:29,91 --> 0:55:30,7
And I'll be like, get in here!


1418
0:55:30,7 --> 0:55:31,18
What do you want to do?


1419
0:55:31,18 --> 0:55:31,69
Jerk off?


1420
0:55:31,69 --> 0:55:32,21
Watch a game?


1421
0:55:32,21 --> 0:55:33,23
Put a Tapout shirt on?


1422
0:55:33,23 --> 0:55:35,11
We can do that.


1423
0:55:35,11 --> 0:55:36,17
Hang on, my muffins are ready.


1424
0:55:36,17 --> 0:55:38,94
And then I'll go to
get muffins and


1425
0:55:38,94 --> 0:55:40,28
explain my apron to him.


1426
0:55:40,28 --> 0:55:41,53
The point is.


1427
0:55:41,53 --> 0:55:45,1



1428
0:55:45,1 --> 0:55:46,87
And then the older one will--


1429
0:55:46,87 --> 0:55:48,72
she'll date, and she'll get her
heart broken because she's


1430
0:55:48,72 --> 0:55:49,34
open hearted.


1431
0:55:49,34 --> 0:55:51,63
And she'll give her heart
to a dude, and he'll


1432
0:55:51,63 --> 0:55:54,4
fucking fuck it up.


1433
0:55:54,4 --> 0:55:55,75
But then she'll have her little
sister there to take


1434
0:55:55,75 --> 0:55:58,45
care of her, to watch
out for her.


1435
0:55:58,45 --> 0:56:1,4
And I sort of like to imagine
the scene, like a John Hughes


1436
0:56:1,4 --> 0:56:4,92
type movie where they're at high
school together because


1437
0:56:4,92 --> 0:56:6,5
they're only three
years apart.


1438
0:56:6,5 --> 0:56:8,197
True, that's my older daughter,
she gets her heart


1439
0:56:8,197 --> 0:56:10,55
broken and she runs off
down the hall, crying.


1440
0:56:10,55 --> 0:56:12,82
And then she goes to the
bathroom and she's in tears.


1441
0:56:12,82 --> 0:56:14,67
But then she notices her
reflection in the mirror, and


1442
0:56:14,67 --> 0:56:15,92
she's delighted by
reflections.


1443
0:56:15,92 --> 0:56:28,66



1444
0:56:28,66 --> 0:56:30,69
And then my little one will just
walk over to this dude


1445
0:56:30,69 --> 0:56:39,47
that's standing by the locker,
put out her cigarette, and go,


1446
0:56:39,47 --> 0:56:39,605
[LISPING]


1447
0:56:39,605 --> 0:56:45,4
if you fuck with my sister
again, fuck with my sister


1448
0:56:45,4 --> 0:56:47,99
again, I will kill you.


1449
0:56:47,99 --> 0:56:50,22
My imaginary friends hate me.

ROVE MCMANUS: Greg Behrendt!


1455
0:56:58,8 --> 0:57:0,635
That's how you do it.


1456
0:57:0,635 --> 0:57:5,28
It is, it is, so I'm thinking.


1457
0:57:5,28 --> 0:57:7,6
That is it, ladies
and gentlemen.


1458
0:57:7,6 --> 0:57:7,96
That is our show.


1459
0:57:7,96 --> 0:57:10,26
Did you enjoy yourselves?


1460
0:57:10,26 --> 0:57:11,14
Yeah, you did.


1461
0:57:11,14 --> 0:57:13,4
It was free.


1462
0:57:13,4 --> 0:57:17,3
And for you at home it was
free, too, unless you pay


1463
0:57:17,3 --> 0:57:19,62
yourself to go into your own
house, in which case


1464
0:57:19,62 --> 0:57:22,18
that make no sense.

of course, on YouTube.

0:57:32,41 --> 0:57:33,58
Yes, nice.

0:57:33,58 --> 0:57:34,68
Good reaction.


1471
0:57:34,68 --> 0:57:35,9
That's the one to have.


1472
0:57:35,9 --> 0:57:37,16
A round of applause
for yourselves.

a great crowd.
