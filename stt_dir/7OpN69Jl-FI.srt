0:12:24,211 --> 0:12:41,32
Please?


208
0:12:41,32 --> 0:12:46,22
Don't you ever, ever, ever take
my baby away from me, d'you hear me?


209
0:12:46,22 --> 0:12:52,82
There was no need for this fucking
palaver. I'm a reasonable woman!

Frank, stop this!


215
0:13:6,76 --> 0:13:10,68
Yeah!


216
0:13:10,68 --> 0:13:12,16
Everyone, feck off!


217
0:13:12,16 --> 0:13:13,119
No. Get lost for a couple of hours.


218
0:13:13,119 --> 0:13:14,111
Piss off.


219
0:13:14,111 --> 0:13:16,56
I'll get on to social services.


220
0:13:16,56 --> 0:13:22,2
Find a foster family.
And it'll be bye-bye, benefits.


221
0:13:22,2 --> 0:13:28,56
Up to you. I will do it!


222

224
0:13:48,62 --> 0:13:52,53
I can understand you don't want
the cripple cramping your style.


225
0:13:52,53 --> 0:13:59,61
But come on. At least...


226
0:13:59,61 --> 0:14:5,1
I couldn't live with what I'd done.
What you did to get rid of me.


227
0:14:5,1 --> 0:14:6,481
So this is your revenge, is it?


228
0:14:6,481 --> 0:14:11,61
No! I just wanted to see for myself.
That's all. See you.


229
0:14:11,61 --> 0:14:15,28
But then I saw her.
So I left school.


230
0:14:15,28 --> 0:14:18,21
Got a job, and saved up
for this place.


231
0:14:18,21 --> 0:14:24,81
You needn't have bothered.
Everything's perfect as it is.


232
0:14:24,81 --> 0:14:28,48
Can you get off me now, please?


233
0:14:28,48 --> 0:14:33,14
Lucky for you
my piles are giving me jip.


234
0:14:33,14 --> 0:14:35,83
So what now?


235
0:14:35,83 --> 0:14:37,29
I can't think straight.


236
0:14:37,29 --> 0:14:38,521
You're still in shock.


237
0:14:38,521 --> 0:14:42,43
I know it's my fault
but you can't leave like this.


238
0:14:42,43 --> 0:14:44,88
Argh!


239
0:14:44,88 --> 0:14:48,55
Next door's empty. So once I've
knocked this through and decorated,


240
0:14:48,55 --> 0:14:50,281
this place will be like a palace.


241
0:14:50,281 --> 0:14:52,72
You doing this
is giving him false hope.


242
0:14:52,72 --> 0:14:53,681
How?


243
0:14:53,681 --> 0:14:58,1
You think Sue's gonna drop
everything and fly over here?


244
0:14:58,1 --> 0:15:0,549
Sue agreed!
She's coming over with the kids!


245
0:15:0,549 --> 0:15:2,11
Told you.


246
0:15:2,11 --> 0:15:5,18
We'll never get it done in time.
Not the way Sue'd want.


247
0:15:5,18 --> 0:15:6,671
If me and you work together,
we will.


248
0:15:6,671 --> 0:15:8,37
I'll help with the decorating.


249
0:15:8,37 --> 0:15:10,8
(LAUGHS)


250
0:15:10,8 --> 0:15:15,96
Look, I'm not being funny,
but this is man's work.


251
0:15:15,96 --> 0:15:17,921
Shane mind you helping?
You don't have to...


252
0:15:17,921 --> 0:15:20,11
It's fine. Shane's fine.


253
0:15:20,11 --> 0:15:28,2
I want to help.


254
0:15:28,2 --> 0:15:40,68
I'll leave you men to it.


255
0:15:40,68 --> 0:15:53,88
Hammer time!

0:16:27,88 --> 0:16:31,56
Oohh...


260
0:16:31,56 --> 0:16:33,76
Wake up.


261
0:16:33,76 --> 0:16:34,991
That's mine! Get off.


262
0:16:34,991 --> 0:16:38,9
Move, get out the house now.
Everyone, out, now. Get out! Move!


263
0:16:38,9 --> 0:16:42,7
Oi, get the fuck out, go on, move.


264
0:16:42,7 --> 0:17:18,79
Up, now. Get out, now.


265
0:17:18,79 --> 0:17:19,751
Where've you been?


266
0:17:19,751 --> 0:17:21,96
Celebrating my Polish friend's
new job.


267
0:17:21,96 --> 0:17:26,85
No, no, no, Hun-gar-y.


268
0:17:26,85 --> 0:17:31,27
Oh, yeah, me too. Packet of
turkey flavoured crisps do you?


269
0:17:31,27 --> 0:17:33,69
And Aidan's demise.
Money isn't worth it.


270
0:17:33,69 --> 0:17:35,42
What? Why?


271
0:17:35,42 --> 0:17:37,63
I was thrown out my own house!


272
0:17:37,63 --> 0:17:40,81
A man my age shouldn't
have to put up with that.


273
0:17:40,81 --> 0:17:42,2
I should be living in comfort.


274
0:17:42,2 --> 0:17:44,231
Men of your age
are usually out working.


275
0:17:44,231 --> 0:17:47,66
I've had more jobs than Mr Benn.
I am not work shy.


276
0:17:47,66 --> 0:17:50,59
It's my back, you see.


277
0:17:50,59 --> 0:17:52,799
I know you're not,
you're fucking allergic.


278
0:17:52,799 --> 0:17:54,741
This is just a blip.
I'll sort Aidan.


279
0:17:54,741 --> 0:17:56,95
You've done enough damage.
For his own sake,


280
0:17:56,95 --> 0:17:58,921
he needs to be reminded
who's in charge.


281
0:17:58,921 --> 0:18:1,6
He's due in court tomorrow.


282
0:18:1,6 --> 0:18:3,55
His solicitor says it's up to me


283
0:18:3,55 --> 0:18:6,5
whether he's packed off
to a young offenders or not.


284
0:18:6,5 --> 0:18:9,43
Best place for him.


285
0:18:9,43 --> 0:18:10,651
You can't.


286
0:18:10,651 --> 0:18:13,1
Nothing gets past you, does it?


287
0:18:13,1 --> 0:18:15,55
The way you treated the house.
Me and Frank.


288
0:18:15,55 --> 0:18:18,48
After everything I've done for you?
Is that fair?


289
0:18:18,48 --> 0:18:19,461
Patty?


290
0:18:19,461 --> 0:18:21,16
I could get you off.


291
0:18:21,16 --> 0:18:23,61
I could persuade Frank,
to keep you at home


292
0:18:23,61 --> 0:18:41,73
if you promise your days
of taking the piss are over.


293
0:18:41,73 --> 0:18:43,68
Room for a little one?


294
0:18:43,68 --> 0:18:46,6
Time you've finished,
water'll be cold.


295
0:18:46,6 --> 0:18:50,54
It took me an hour and
80 kettles to fill up this.


296
0:18:50,54 --> 0:18:53,95
What's the matter? You're the one
who said we should bond, get closer.


297
0:18:53,95 --> 0:18:56,9
There are certain boundaries
you just don't cross.


298
0:18:56,9 --> 0:19:5,95
What's the matter? I'm not gay.


299
0:19:5,95 --> 0:19:8,4
Plum fiddler! Cock jockey!


300
0:19:8,4 --> 0:19:9,859
Arse bandit! Bollock ninja!


301
0:19:9,859 --> 0:19:10,841
Brother fucker!


302
0:19:10,841 --> 0:19:13,53
This is exactly why
I didn't say anything.


303
0:19:13,53 --> 0:19:18,67
I am capable of being mates with
a man without being pervy, you know.


304
0:19:18,67 --> 0:19:22,1
I see you as a mate, nothing more,
so don't flatter yourself.


305
0:19:22,1 --> 0:19:48,76
You're not even my type anyway.


306
0:19:48,76 --> 0:19:51,45
So...


307
0:19:51,45 --> 0:19:56,59
Who is your type?


308
0:19:56,59 --> 0:19:59,4
Go on?


309
0:19:59,4 --> 0:20:1,96
Well...


310
0:20:1,96 --> 0:20:3,931
Just someone nice and loving.


311
0:20:3,931 --> 0:20:10,53
Who I can tell anything to
and just know it'd be safe with him.


312
0:20:10,53 --> 0:20:12,501
Someone who's easy to talk to,


313
0:20:12,501 --> 0:20:16,65
and will always be there for me
no matter what.


314
0:20:16,65 --> 0:20:20,32
When I'm sad, he'd comfort me and
tell me everything will be OK.


315
0:20:20,32 --> 0:20:21,41
Big dick!


316
0:20:21,41 --> 0:20:25,46
Yeah!


317
0:20:25,46 --> 0:20:30,12
What about you?


318
0:20:30,12 --> 0:20:34,27
There is someone.


319
0:20:34,27 --> 0:20:41,11
Trust her with my life.
She's perfect.


320
0:20:41,11 --> 0:20:50,18
I'd be with her now
but... it's difficult.


321
0:20:50,18 --> 0:20:52,36
I know who it is!


322
0:20:52,36 --> 0:20:54,57
Well, it's Sue, innit?


323
0:20:54,57 --> 0:20:59,23
You don't just want your kids back,
you want her back too.


324
0:20:59,23 --> 0:21:8,76
You want to be a family again.


325
0:21:8,76 --> 0:21:20,52
Awww.


326
0:21:20,52 --> 0:21:27,6
(SNORES LOUDLY)


327
0:21:27,6 --> 0:21:32,25
You snore like a jumbo jet.


328
0:21:32,25 --> 0:21:34,94
If you're hungry,
there's cereal or toast.


329
0:21:34,94 --> 0:21:38,13
I like a full English.


330
0:21:38,13 --> 0:21:41,6
In the grill. Kept it warm for you.


331
0:21:41,6 --> 0:21:42,76
Smart arse.


332
0:21:42,76 --> 0:21:49,63
BABY CRYING


333
0:21:49,63 --> 0:21:52,56
I can't deny Cilla her dad.


334
0:21:52,56 --> 0:21:55,99
What kind of mother
would that make me?


335
0:21:55,99 --> 0:21:59,16
I want to tell me kids.


336
0:21:59,16 --> 0:22:2,11
I don't want to be "a" dad.
I'm her dad.


337
0:22:2,11 --> 0:22:4,561
I want to be in Cilla's life
for the rest of mine. And...


338
0:22:4,561 --> 0:22:7,0
Don't be getting ahead of yourself.


339
0:22:7,0 --> 0:22:20,95
Things need to be sorted between
me and my family first. Understand?


340
0:22:20,95 --> 0:22:25,1
Cheese and tomato pizza?


341
0:22:25,1 --> 0:22:27,55
Cheese and tomato garlic bread.


342
0:22:27,55 --> 0:22:29,76
I got you a meat feast.
But she is vegetarian.


343
0:22:29,76 --> 0:22:30,739
Yeah...


344
0:22:30,739 --> 0:22:31,961
Fuck have you been?


345
0:22:31,961 --> 0:22:35,13
Where d'you think? With that
snidey twitching twat, Marty.


346
0:22:35,13 --> 0:22:36,119
He's all right.


347
0:22:36,119 --> 0:22:36,839
He's scum.


348
0:22:36,839 --> 0:22:37,821
You're scum.


349
0:22:37,821 --> 0:22:39,4
Shane.


350
0:22:39,4 --> 0:22:41,49
All of you, fucking drop it!


351
0:22:41,49 --> 0:22:43,7
Got something to tell you.


352
0:22:43,7 --> 0:22:48,84
It's about...


353
0:22:48,84 --> 0:22:52,0
It's about...


354
0:22:52,0 --> 0:22:53,73
It's about...


355
0:22:53,73 --> 0:22:56,9
You going to keep us in suspenders
or what, Mam?


356
0:22:56,9 --> 0:22:59,11
It's about Cilla's dad.


357
0:22:59,11 --> 0:23:0,81
We know. Billy Tutton.


358
0:23:0,81 --> 0:23:2,3
Fucking what?


359
0:23:2,3 --> 0:23:4,0
I only told Shane!


360
0:23:4,0 --> 0:23:5,471
Nobody told me!


361
0:23:5,471 --> 0:23:8,9
I've been worried sick keeping it
a secret because I was ashamed.


362
0:23:8,9 --> 0:23:11,35
Mimi, you shagged a 14 year old?


363
0:23:11,35 --> 0:23:12,811
Did she, fuck. Mam's not a paedo.


364
0:23:12,811 --> 0:23:15,5
How is Cilla Billy's
if they didn't shag, dickhead?


365
0:23:15,5 --> 0:23:18,93
Well, got his...


366
0:23:18,93 --> 0:23:20,159
Well, she opened...


367
0:23:20,159 --> 0:23:23,83
Mum, tell her you're not a paedo!
Are you?


368
0:23:23,83 --> 0:23:26,1
I didn't know how old he was.
I gave him wanks.


369
0:23:26,1 --> 0:23:29,44
And sometimes I'd...


370
0:23:29,44 --> 0:23:32,4
I'd lie in bed and flick me bean
while he stood over tugging off.


371
0:23:32,4 --> 0:23:33,861
Argh. No!


372
0:23:33,861 --> 0:23:36,55
One time he got too close
and there was a spillage.


373
0:23:36,55 --> 0:23:43,15
At the time, Billy warned I could
get pregnant. I never thought I...


374
0:23:43,15 --> 0:23:47,56
See. It was a jizz finger,
that's all.


375
0:23:47,56 --> 0:23:57,33
Mam, you've done nothing
to be ashamed of. And we love you.


376
0:23:57,33 --> 0:23:59,78
He's back. He wants access to Cilla.


377
0:23:59,78 --> 0:24:1,749
No way! I'll tear
his fucking bollocks off!


378
0:24:1,749 --> 0:24:3,689
I'll carve him a new arsehole!


379
0:24:3,689 --> 0:24:8,35
I'll murder the fucking cunt!


380
0:24:8,35 --> 0:24:11,78
Electronic tag and a 6pm curfew.


381
0:24:11,78 --> 0:24:15,21
How's that punishment?
Human rights gone mad!


382
0:24:15,21 --> 0:24:20,35
Oi! What's he doing in my room?


383
0:24:20,35 --> 0:24:23,28
That's our contingency.
We rented it out.


384
0:24:23,28 --> 0:24:27,19
Your mother could turn up any day.
We have to cover our backs.


385
0:24:27,19 --> 0:24:29,88
Until then, you won't be taking
the proverbial any more.


386
0:24:29,88 --> 0:24:31,101
If you don't like it,


387
0:24:31,101 --> 0:24:35,1
you're welcome to give your mates
at social services a call.


388
0:24:35,1 --> 0:24:38,92
You'll get used to sharing.
He works nights, security.


389
0:24:38,92 --> 0:24:41,13
So he'll sleep all day.


390
0:24:41,13 --> 0:24:43,1
You won't even know he's there.


391
0:24:43,1 --> 0:24:47,25
And I'm obliged to let you know
he's on the sex offenders register.


392
0:24:47,25 --> 0:24:50,44
Some lost in translation thing.


393
0:24:50,44 --> 0:25:11,3
It's a stupid law anyway.


394
0:25:11,3 --> 0:25:12,49
You have to leave, now.


395
0:25:12,49 --> 0:25:14,7
The news about you
didn't go down well.


396
0:25:14,7 --> 0:25:15,919
They want your blood
and I can't protect you.


397
0:25:15,919 --> 0:25:17,889
I didn't come back, do all this,


398
0:25:17,889 --> 0:25:18,849
to just run away.


399
0:25:18,849 --> 0:25:19,841
Are you daft?


400
0:25:19,841 --> 0:25:23,3
You can't just show up and act
like everything's normal.


401
0:25:23,3 --> 0:25:24,73
It's not. It's fucked up!


402
0:25:24,73 --> 0:25:27,18
I'm older, I'm not a kid any more.
I'm 16.


403
0:25:27,18 --> 0:25:30,37
If you give me a chance,
we can make it work.


404
0:25:30,37 --> 0:25:33,54
I have to know I'm doing
the right thing by Cilla


405
0:25:33,54 --> 0:25:36,47
and without my lads on side,
you can't be in her life.


406
0:25:36,47 --> 0:25:42,35
You need to prove to me and them
that you're ready to be her father.


407
0:25:42,35 --> 0:25:44,32
And if you can't, I understand,


408
0:25:44,32 --> 0:25:49,21
but it's that or nothing.


409
0:25:49,21 --> 0:25:53,84
"The three billy goats gruff
had to cross a river.


410
0:25:53,84 --> 0:25:57,4
"There was only one bridge across it


411
0:25:57,4 --> 0:25:59,48
"and under the bridge
lived a nasty troll.


412
0:25:59,48 --> 0:26:10,98
"The smallest billy goat gruff
was the first to get to the bridge...


413
0:26:10,98 --> 0:26:14,89
"The next billy goat gruff
crossed the bridge.


414
0:26:14,89 --> 0:26:19,79
"Clip-clop, clip-clop. 'Who's
that clip-clopping over my bridge?',


415
0:26:19,79 --> 0:26:24,18
"shouted the troll...


416
0:26:24,18 --> 0:26:30,8
"The third billy goat gruff
approached the bridge..."


417
0:26:30,8 --> 0:26:34,21
You're shaking all over.


418
0:26:34,21 --> 0:26:36,42
That's not my fucking problem!


419
0:26:36,42 --> 0:26:40,57
Just do what you're fucking told
or I'll rip you in fucking two!


420
0:26:40,57 --> 0:26:44,24
I know it's what you wanted,
but I can't do it.


421
0:26:44,24 --> 0:26:46,21
I'm not meeting Jamie.


422
0:26:46,21 --> 0:26:49,88
It'd be suicide.


423
0:26:49,88 --> 0:26:53,29
For Cilla, I can't be reckless
with my life.


424
0:26:53,29 --> 0:27:0,4
Please don't take her away from me.


425
0:27:0,4 --> 0:27:1,379
What the fuck?!


426
0:27:1,379 --> 0:27:4,55
I love ya.


427
0:27:4,55 --> 0:27:9,68
I've been up the wall trying to get
a grip of how to make this work


428
0:27:9,68 --> 0:27:12,4
and you've been lying to me?
You don't want Cilla!


429
0:27:12,4 --> 0:27:13,361
You want to get into
me knickers again!


430
0:27:13,361 --> 0:27:15,8
I do want Cilla... and I want you.


431
0:27:15,8 --> 0:27:16,551
You can't have us both.


432
0:27:16,551 --> 0:27:19,24
Why not? You love me. I know it.


433
0:27:19,24 --> 0:27:21,44
We can be a family.


434
0:27:21,44 --> 0:27:22,91
I don't love you, Billy,


435
0:27:22,91 --> 0:27:35,87
and if you can't accept that,
the deal's off.


436
0:27:35,87 --> 0:27:38,8
Have you finished with
Lillian's tool box?


437
0:27:38,8 --> 0:27:40,281
Cos I've got a few
decorating ideas...


438
0:27:40,281 --> 0:27:44,2
Fuck me! Where did you...?


439
0:27:44,2 --> 0:27:48,85
(SHOUTS) Oi! You bastard!


440
0:27:48,85 --> 0:27:52,26
(THEY LAUGH)


441
0:27:52,26 --> 0:27:56,68
Well, couldn't wait for you.
Sue's flying over tomorrow.


442
0:27:56,68 --> 0:27:58,141
Do you like it?


443
0:27:58,141 --> 0:27:59,84
I love it!


444
0:27:59,84 --> 0:28:1,7
If...


445
0:28:1,7 --> 0:28:4,74
If you was a high-maintenance
kinda girl,


446
0:28:4,74 --> 0:28:7,19
would this sort of place
give you a wide-on?


447
0:28:7,19 --> 0:28:8,171
I beg your pardon?


448
0:28:8,171 --> 0:28:12,8
Well, Marty's trying to get back
with Sue so any ideas?


449
0:28:12,8 --> 0:28:13,551
Didn't realise.


450
0:28:13,551 --> 0:28:17,72
Mainly for the kids.
I mean, one step at a time.


451
0:28:17,72 --> 0:28:20,15
How we supposed to put
a shelf up with that?


452
0:28:20,15 --> 0:28:21,641
I best get off.


453
0:28:21,641 --> 0:28:24,32
I'm helping Shane with Mimi's party.


454
0:28:24,32 --> 0:28:27,49
I'm really excited for you, Marty,
I hope it works out.


455
0:28:27,49 --> 0:28:29,94
Come tomorrow and meet my kids.


456
0:28:29,94 --> 0:28:30,921
I don't want to be in the way.


457
0:28:30,921 --> 0:28:46,57
You won't.


458
0:28:46,57 --> 0:28:49,76
An old work mate heard where Mum is.
Gave me the address.


459
0:28:49,76 --> 0:28:52,96
S'cuse me, have you seen her?
She's my mum.


460
0:28:52,96 --> 0:28:54,66
She's got blacky brown hair.


461
0:28:54,66 --> 0:28:59,8
About this big.


462
0:28:59,8 --> 0:29:2,0
Ta for keeping hold of my tag.


463
0:29:2,0 --> 0:29:3,47
I tried it on but...


464
0:29:3,47 --> 0:29:5,41
I can't get it off.


465
0:29:5,41 --> 0:29:10,7
Soak your ankle in warm water.


466
0:29:10,7 --> 0:29:21,56
(SPEAKS IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE)


467
0:29:21,56 --> 0:29:26,7
Either tell me now, or three glasses
later when the truth juice kicks in.


468
0:29:26,7 --> 0:29:28,91
I'm fine.


469
0:29:28,91 --> 0:29:31,6
I was going to give Billy a chance,
only he tried it on,


470
0:29:31,6 --> 0:29:33,561
said he loved me, so I called it off.


471
0:29:33,561 --> 0:29:37,96
That because you don't love him
back, or because you do?


472
0:29:37,96 --> 0:29:39,68
Neither.


473
0:29:39,68 --> 0:29:43,6
Can't do right for doing wrong?


474
0:29:43,6 --> 0:29:46,52
Me, too.


475
0:29:46,52 --> 0:29:48,97
He's not ready anyway, he's 16.


476
0:29:48,97 --> 0:29:56,32
Truthfully, when is anyone
ready to be a parent?


477
0:29:56,32 --> 0:29:59,99
Doesn't matter, my lads have made
it clear they'll never accept it.


478
0:29:59,99 --> 0:30:1,691
This is the best thing for everyone.


479
0:30:1,691 --> 0:30:3,42
Except Cilla.


480
0:30:3,42 --> 0:30:6,35
You're going to have tell her
why you rejected her dad.


481
0:30:6,35 --> 0:30:8,56
Because he said he loved you?!


482
0:30:8,56 --> 0:30:10,2
Want some advice?


483
0:30:10,2 --> 0:30:12,47
Grow a clit, for fuck's sake,


484
0:30:12,47 --> 0:30:14,921
and stop hiding behind your boys
and making excuses!


485
0:30:14,921 --> 0:30:17,36
Take control before you regret it.


486
0:30:17,36 --> 0:30:21,28
Don't talk to me like that!


487
0:30:21,28 --> 0:30:22,98
You're right though.


488
0:30:22,98 --> 0:30:26,17
She'll find out when she's old
enough, then she'll hate me.


489
0:30:26,17 --> 0:30:29,1
Thanks(!)


490
0:30:29,1 --> 0:30:33,76
Pleasure(!)


491
0:30:33,76 --> 0:30:35,94
Do him, son, do him, do him!


492
0:30:35,94 --> 0:30:37,671
Yes! Kicked your arse again!


493
0:30:37,671 --> 0:30:39,61
That's the third time.


494
0:30:39,61 --> 0:30:44,3
Do you want another round?


495
0:30:44,3 --> 0:30:47,2
I know where Mum is.


496
0:30:47,2 --> 0:30:49,401
I might not agree with Patty, but
she's better at this stuff than me.


497
0:30:49,401 --> 0:30:51,37
Don't tell her.


498
0:30:51,37 --> 0:30:54,78
Listen, when people like
your mum disappear


499
0:30:54,78 --> 0:30:56,1
it's because they don't
want to be found.


500
0:30:56,1 --> 0:30:57,73
Thought you'd be on my side?


501
0:30:57,73 --> 0:31:1,14
I am! Look, I've been through it.


502
0:31:1,14 --> 0:31:6,4
I were just like you at your
age, 'cept... better looking!


503
0:31:6,4 --> 0:31:8,48
Hey, from one mate to another,


504
0:31:8,48 --> 0:31:16,7
just be careful.


505
0:31:16,7 --> 0:31:17,291
Made a stew for everyone.


506
0:31:17,291 --> 0:31:22,69
Oh! Grand.


507
0:31:22,69 --> 0:31:29,29
What did you do, piss in it?


508
0:31:29,29 --> 0:31:30,519
Lovely(!)


509
0:31:30,519 --> 0:31:32,959
If I promise to be good,
will you get rid of Poley?


510
0:31:32,959 --> 0:31:34,909
And lose an extra 50 notes a week?


511
0:31:34,909 --> 0:31:36,129
Fucked if I'm going to let that go!


512
0:31:36,129 --> 0:31:37,359
Leave off, Frank.


513
0:31:37,359 --> 0:31:39,319
He's making an effort,
we should embrace it.


514
0:31:39,319 --> 0:31:41,771
Actually, I've suddenly
acquired a hunger.


515
0:31:41,771 --> 0:31:43,24
I made it for tea.


516
0:31:43,24 --> 0:31:45,44
Fancy any, Patty?


517
0:31:45,44 --> 0:31:47,389
You're offering an olive branch.


518
0:31:47,389 --> 0:31:52,52
Do you want me to accept
or snap it in two?


519
0:31:52,52 --> 0:31:53,271
DOOR CLOSES


520
0:31:53,271 --> 0:31:56,7
All right, kiddo?


521
0:31:56,7 --> 0:31:58,401
Come on, come on in, take a seat


522
0:31:58,401 --> 0:32:13,9
and I shall serve you some
of Aidan's lovely stew.


523
0:32:13,9 --> 0:32:15,54
Tastes like arsehole!


524
0:32:15,54 --> 0:32:17,24
Ah, salt!


525
0:32:17,24 --> 0:32:24,59
Mm.


526
0:32:24,59 --> 0:32:28,5
This'll be Patty and Frank at Mimi's
party when the stew kicks.


527
0:32:28,5 --> 0:32:29,96
(FARTING SOUNDS)


528
0:32:29,96 --> 0:32:32,17
(THEY LAUGH)


529
0:32:32,17 --> 0:32:33,88
You will come back and visit?


530
0:32:33,88 --> 0:32:55,16
'Course.


531
0:32:55,16 --> 0:32:56,63
Poley?!


532
0:32:56,63 --> 0:33:9,61
You were only supposed
to shit yourself!


533
0:33:9,61 --> 0:33:11,32
Carl!


534
0:33:11,32 --> 0:33:13,26
Wake up. Help!


535
0:33:13,26 --> 0:33:17,44
Wake up! Help!


536
0:33:17,44 --> 0:33:20,12
Help! Someone help! Help!


537
0:33:20,12 --> 0:33:23,5
Help!


538
0:33:23,5 --> 0:33:24,52
Get your mum!


539
0:33:24,52 --> 0:33:26,0
My baby!


540
0:33:26,0 --> 0:33:26,961
Your mum, she'll know what to do!


541
0:33:26,961 --> 0:33:28,93
She's at Mimi's party.


542
0:33:28,93 --> 0:33:31,14
It's the stew!


543
0:33:31,14 --> 0:33:32,6
Ambulance, please!


544
0:33:32,6 --> 0:33:34,7
Poley's dead!


545
0:33:34,7 --> 0:33:34,811
What?!


546
0:33:34,811 --> 0:33:37,0
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!


547
0:33:37,0 --> 0:33:53,76
(SHOUTS) Aidan!


548
0:33:53,76 --> 0:33:55,94
What you doing out here?


549
0:33:55,94 --> 0:33:58,149
I went to the airport to pick
Sue and the kids up,


550
0:33:58,149 --> 0:33:59,609
and they weren't there.


551
0:33:59,609 --> 0:34:3,4
The bitch didn't even book a flight.
I checked.


552
0:34:3,4 --> 0:34:6,48
How's Marty?


553
0:34:6,48 --> 0:34:8,18
He's in the flat waiting.


554
0:34:8,18 --> 0:34:37,29
How can I tell him? It'll crush him.


555
0:34:37,29 --> 0:34:43,65
No! It took me ages to put them up!


556
0:34:43,65 --> 0:34:44,161
Fuck!


557
0:34:44,161 --> 0:34:47,59
I'm sorry, Marty,
I am, but just calm down!


558
0:34:47,59 --> 0:34:55,65
Look, I'm here for you.


559
0:34:55,65 --> 0:34:59,8
(SOBS)


560
0:34:59,8 --> 0:35:4,22
Come here.


561
0:35:4,22 --> 0:35:6,16
It's never going to happen, is it?


562
0:35:6,16 --> 0:35:10,8
No matter how hard I try.


563
0:35:10,8 --> 0:35:15,72
I've lost them!


564
0:35:15,72 --> 0:35:18,16
I am not going to let you give up.


565
0:35:18,16 --> 0:35:36,76
Trust me.


566
0:35:36,76 --> 0:35:41,4
CHEERING


567
0:35:41,4 --> 0:35:48,5
♪ Happy Birthday, dear Mimi... ♪


568
0:35:48,5 --> 0:35:49,96
Awkward.


569
0:35:49,96 --> 0:36:15,4
Clear the pub.
We've got some family issues to sort.


570
0:36:15,4 --> 0:36:22,51
Mum!


571
0:36:22,51 --> 0:36:24,481
So why didn't you come for me, then?


572
0:36:24,481 --> 0:36:27,16
Wanted this place done up.
Ready for you.


573
0:36:27,16 --> 0:36:33,52
Wait till you see the wallpaper
I've picked for your room.


574
0:36:33,52 --> 0:36:34,991
You could've phoned, or a letter?


575
0:36:34,991 --> 0:36:41,59
Supposed to be a surprise.


576
0:36:41,59 --> 0:36:44,52
Anyway, it's not just the flat.


577
0:36:44,52 --> 0:36:46,481
I needed to sort myself out as well.


578
0:36:46,481 --> 0:36:51,86
Been clean for 12 months.


579
0:36:51,86 --> 0:36:56,4
Couldn't have done it without Eddie.


580
0:36:56,4 --> 0:36:57,74
Eddie?!


581
0:36:57,74 --> 0:37:0,91
Volunteer at the prison.


582
0:37:0,91 --> 0:37:2,131
Patty know your here?


583
0:37:2,131 --> 0:37:5,32
I'm not going back.


584
0:37:5,32 --> 0:37:9,24
A couple of days, tops,
while I get your room ready.


585
0:37:9,24 --> 0:37:10,94
I can help decorate.


586
0:37:10,94 --> 0:37:16,58
Come here.


587
0:37:16,58 --> 0:37:18,4
I've missed ya.


588
0:37:18,4 --> 0:37:25,15
I'll just get you that drink.


589
0:37:25,15 --> 0:37:28,82
DOOR CLOSES THEN LOCKS


590
0:37:28,82 --> 0:37:31,51
No! Mum!

0:37:31,51 --> 0:37:33,72
You don't know what I've done!


592
0:37:33,72 --> 0:37:36,14
What have you done?


593
0:37:36,14 --> 0:37:37,631
What are you talking about?


594
0:37:37,631 --> 0:37:39,81
Left this in his bedsit.


595
0:37:39,81 --> 0:37:43,24
Getting a bit fucking sloppy,
aren't you?


596
0:37:43,24 --> 0:37:46,17
Shane saw how stressed you were,
so we put the feelers out.


597
0:37:46,17 --> 0:37:48,881
Turns out the little fucker's
dealing for Joe Jangles.


598
0:37:48,881 --> 0:37:52,56
So we got his address, went round
gave him the full Maguire treatment.


599
0:37:52,56 --> 0:37:53,761
He won't be coming back.


600
0:37:53,761 --> 0:37:54,98
He's...?


601
0:37:54,98 --> 0:37:57,93
Ta-da!


602
0:37:57,93 --> 0:38:0,14
Happy birthday, Mam.


603
0:38:0,14 --> 0:38:3,31
Due on the six o'clock
to Billericay.


604
0:38:3,31 --> 0:38:5,28
God give me patience,


605
0:38:5,28 --> 0:38:9,19
cos if he gave me strength
I'd twat the pair of you!


606
0:38:9,19 --> 0:38:18,72
Untie him now!


607
0:38:18,72 --> 0:38:20,179
Marty likes you.


608
0:38:20,179 --> 0:38:21,909
No, he loves you.


609
0:38:21,909 --> 0:38:23,371
Do you love him?


610
0:38:23,371 --> 0:38:25,34
Marty's like family to me.


611
0:38:25,34 --> 0:38:26,801
You liar.


612
0:38:26,801 --> 0:38:28,3
I'm not!


613
0:38:28,3 --> 0:38:31,44
Don't insult me.
I've seen the way you held him,


614
0:38:31,44 --> 0:38:33,64
the way you stared at each other.


615
0:38:33,64 --> 0:38:36,84
You put me up with him so you'd have
a nice little excuse to see him.


616
0:38:36,84 --> 0:38:38,781
The same reason why he let me stay.


617
0:38:38,781 --> 0:38:42,45
The pair of you have been taking me
for a right fucking mug!


618
0:38:42,45 --> 0:38:46,6
Micky, whatever feelings you think
I've got for Marty, you're wrong.


619
0:38:46,6 --> 0:38:49,5
Believe me, Shane is the man I love.


620
0:38:49,5 --> 0:38:51,759
He's the reason that you
and Shane have been fighting.


621
0:38:51,759 --> 0:38:54,211
Shane blames Marty,
but it's not his fault.


622
0:38:54,211 --> 0:38:56,9
Nothing's going on.
Me and Shane are working it out.


623
0:38:56,9 --> 0:38:59,83
I'm not going to interfere.
It's your business.


624
0:38:59,83 --> 0:39:3,2
But if you can't be honest with me,
be honest with yourself.


625
0:39:3,2 --> 0:39:7,89
For your marriage.


626
0:39:7,89 --> 0:39:10,34
Whoa, where's the party?


627
0:39:10,34 --> 0:39:13,77
Where the fuck've you been?


628
0:39:13,77 --> 0:39:18,91
She's been helping me
with some stuff.


629
0:39:18,91 --> 0:39:20,64
Billy's staying.


630
0:39:20,64 --> 0:39:21,839
And he's moving in.


631
0:39:21,839 --> 0:39:22,581
Not happening.


632
0:39:22,581 --> 0:39:24,79
No fucking way he's staying here.


633
0:39:24,79 --> 0:39:27,48
Billy is Cilla's dad,
your sister's father.


634
0:39:27,48 --> 0:39:30,91
Like it or not, you have to respect
that, like I did for you.


635
0:39:30,91 --> 0:39:35,6
When Karen cheated
and ran away with Connor,


636
0:39:35,6 --> 0:39:37,29
I thought good riddance
to the slapper.


637
0:39:37,29 --> 0:39:38,491
But when you forgave her,


638
0:39:38,491 --> 0:39:43,39
who was the only one
to welcome her back with open arms?


639
0:39:43,39 --> 0:39:46,56
I nearly disowned you
when you came home with a prossie,


640
0:39:46,56 --> 0:39:51,45
but you didn't give a shit and you
stuck by her, and I'm glad you did


641
0:39:51,45 --> 0:39:54,88
because Kelly's turned out to be
fucking quality.


642
0:39:54,88 --> 0:39:57,33
And you...


643
0:39:57,33 --> 0:39:58,51
Me?!


644
0:39:58,51 --> 0:40:0,74
we were mortified
when you came home with a pink limo.


645
0:40:0,74 --> 0:40:1,241
It's fu...


646
0:40:1,241 --> 0:40:6,38
Fucking fuchsia, whatever!


647
0:40:6,38 --> 0:40:10,29
I know my own mind, like you lot do


648
0:40:10,29 --> 0:40:15,19
and he may not be perfect,
but he's everything Cilla needs.


649
0:40:15,19 --> 0:40:20,8
And I know he'll make a good dad.


650
0:40:20,8 --> 0:40:24,24
And he's boss at footy, too.


651
0:40:24,24 --> 0:40:43,8
There's no way
he'll ever be one of us.


652
0:40:43,8 --> 0:40:45,28
Billy, this arrangement is for Cilla.


653
0:40:45,28 --> 0:40:48,21
You dare attempt
to look sexy-eyed at me


654
0:40:48,21 --> 0:41:10,96
and I'll send you back to Billericay
a fucking eunuch. Right?


655
0:41:10,96 --> 0:41:15,14
What's going on?
It's my house, it's me son Carl!


656
0:41:15,14 --> 0:41:17,32
Aidan. Where's Aidan? What happened?


657
0:41:17,32 --> 0:41:18,551
Is he OK?


658
0:41:18,551 --> 0:41:22,22
Carl! Carl!


659
0:41:22,22 --> 0:41:24,191
Patty!
Aidan pulled Carl from the house.


660
0:41:24,191 --> 0:41:26,64
If he'd been there any longer...


661
0:41:26,64 --> 0:41:27,861
Where is he?


662
0:41:27,861 --> 0:41:43,99
Carl! Is he alive? Talk to me, son.
Talk to your dad.


663
0:41:43,99 --> 0:41:48,64
Didn't jump out the window, then?


664
0:41:48,64 --> 0:41:51,9
Your stew didn't finish Poley off.


665
0:41:51,9 --> 0:41:53,78
Carbon monoxide poisoning
from his own


666
0:41:53,78 --> 0:41:57,69
half-arsed effort
on the water heater did.


667
0:41:57,69 --> 0:42:12,38
Carl's going to be OK, cos of you.


668
0:42:12,38 --> 0:42:15,7
Patty...


669
0:42:15,7 --> 0:42:19,72
Could you give us a moment, please?


670
0:42:19,72 --> 0:42:20,949
I'm not taking Aidan.


671
0:42:20,949 --> 0:42:22,891
The boy needs to be with his mother.


672
0:42:22,891 --> 0:42:26,56
I'll be good, I promise.


673
0:42:26,56 --> 0:42:28,771
I'll stay in school
and I won't cause trouble.


674
0:42:28,771 --> 0:42:30,24
Please, Mum?


675
0:42:30,24 --> 0:42:32,92
No. You've got to,
or he'll have to go into care.


676
0:42:32,92 --> 0:42:33,911
What?!


677
0:42:33,911 --> 0:42:37,1
I'm clean,
and I want to stay that way.


678
0:42:37,1 --> 0:42:40,51
If I took him back, I'd be on
the streets and shooting up in days.


679
0:42:40,51 --> 0:42:42,72
You want me better, don't you?


680
0:42:42,72 --> 0:42:43,941
Don't you dare blame him
for your shortcomings!


681
0:42:43,941 --> 0:42:45,91
It's true!


682
0:42:45,91 --> 0:42:51,52
I wonder where my years have gone!
Wonder how I'm 29 and look 40!


683
0:42:51,52 --> 0:42:55,94
I wonder why
my life's turned so shit!


684
0:42:55,94 --> 0:42:57,64
I wonder.

0:42:59,11 --> 0:43:1,8

0:43:1,8 --> 0:43:3,52
He's more than you deserve!


688
0:43:3,52 --> 0:43:6,69
You are and always have been
a snotty-nosed,


689
0:43:6,69 --> 0:43:9,38
no-good selfish spiteful whore!


690
0:43:9,38 --> 0:43:10,121
Shut up! Shut up!


691
0:43:10,121 --> 0:43:12,57
You don't justify an ounce of pity!


692
0:43:12,57 --> 0:43:15,2
Patty...


693
0:43:15,2 --> 0:43:17,95
Wait outside.


694
0:43:17,95 --> 0:43:27,74
Please!


695
0:43:27,74 --> 0:43:30,91
You wasn't coming for me, was ya?


696
0:43:30,91 --> 0:43:34,34
You always promised
things would get better.


697
0:43:34,34 --> 0:43:37,27
That you'd change.


698
0:43:37,27 --> 0:43:39,98
They never did...


699
0:43:39,98 --> 0:43:47,56
cos of me?


700
0:43:47,56 --> 0:44:4,2
I'm better off without you.


701
0:44:4,2 --> 0:44:12,2
I'll hold you to that.
