###4 ATIBA JEFFERSON: There's one other photo.
###6 Let's see.
###7 I can just bring it to you so you don't have to move.
###11 
###15 This one's just hilarious.
###17 So this is when I started doing basketball shit.
###20 
###23 We're big basketball fans.
###24 And at that time, I'd just started shooting for the NBA
###27 and doing that stuff.
###29 So we are always hanging out.
###33 The third year, the Lakers won the finals.
###37 I moved out here in 1995.
###40 I remember meeting Eric at TransWorld.
###42 And I was just a filmer then.
###44 And I remember there was this line in the TransWorld video
###47 where he does crook backside 180 on the table.
###50 And he just wasn't happy with it.
###52 And I look back at it now, and it's like, yeah.
###55 It was fine.
###55 But no.
###56 It was like a little tack.
###58 And that's why he was over it.
###60 And I was like, dude, that was the gnarliest--
###61 like one of the gnarliest tri-- even to this day if
###63 people crook backside 180 the hard way on the table, it's
###68 like insane.
###70 He's just always held such a high level
###72 since I first met him.
###75 He's one of the first pros that I shot.
###78 And it's funny because I'll get, oh, the big time
###81 photographer.
###82 So much pressure shooting with you.
###84 And I'm like, I'm gonna blame that on Eric.
###86 Because I'm not a big time photographer.
###89 I'm not this stressed out dude.
###91 But people put me in that light because I was shooting
###94 the greatest skater.
###97 I remember this.
###98 This always kind of blew me away.
###99 Like when he kickflip blackslide tailslid to this
###102 rail for Menikmati, it was light speeds ahead of what
###106 people were kickflip back tailing.
###108 And he did it so easy.
###112 I didn't get to skate with him that much during Mouse.
###116 As soon as the Menikmati period started, that's when I
###119 was skating with him a ton.
###122 ERIC KOSTON: I was like, yeah, we're going to do a video.
###124 And I kind of was like, oh.
###126 All right.
###127 Maybe I'll start filming.
###128 And I kind of didn't take it too seriously.
###132 Because it was always like the board brands.
###134 You know what I mean?
###134 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###134 ERIC KOSTON: That was kind of the first shoe on in the one
###137 company that you really focused on making it a really
###141 good part for.
###142 And then I think I got to see some footage that
###144 everyone was doing.
###145 And I'm like, whoa, everyone's really filming.
###147 Holy shit, I better get my shit together and start
###150 filming that part.
###151 I don't want to be the slacker who pulled it together.
###156 [APPLAUSE]
###158 ATIBA JEFFERSON: In Menikmati, he's just destroying it.
###162 And being able to shoot Eric Koston in Koston-mania phase
###170 was huge for my career.
###172 If I'm there shooting Eric, nollie heelflip noseslide
###175 Wilshire 10, I'm the dude that's there for that.
###179 Noseslide Hollywood Bowl.
###182 Eric gave me so many covers in my career.
###185 MALE SPEAKER: What are your favorite
###186 photos you shot of Koston?
###187 ATIBA JEFFERSON: Back noseblunt bricktown.
###190 That, to me, is still a gnarly trick.
###193 
###197 [APPLAUSE]
###198 ATIBA JEFFERSON: And that was a really magical time.
###202 That dude at that point could not be stopped.
###206 TY EVANS: We were going on Europe trips
###208 filming for Yeah Right!
###210 And we saw Eric out there with Fred filming for Menikmati.
###213 I remember running into them in Barcelona and stuff.
###216 I knew if I filmed anything Eric, I knew it was going
###219 towards Menikmati.
###220 Because once he was done with Menikmati, then all of his
###222 focus was gonna be towards Yeah Right!
###224 I remember Atiba telling me, oh, he
###226 backside noseblunted bricktown.
###228 I was like, oh, OK.
###229 He's got his ender.
###229 It's done.
###230 All right.
###231 Sick.
###232 Finally.
###232 We started filming for Yeah Right!
###234 At the same time, Atiba and I, and Lee, and Ako, we're like,
###238 let's make our own video.
###239 We're going to make Chomp on This.
###241 And that just spawned into this guy's coming on.
###244 This guy wants to be part of it .
###245 This guy.
###245 And it just kind of sort of grew.
###246 And then Eric, naturally, was just in the mix.
###250 And it just turned into this one big, weird thing.
###253 ATIBA JEFFERSON: It kind of became the main focus for like
###256 six months.
###258 Like let's see what we can do.
###260 But at the same time, it works perfect because
###262 Eric's warming up.
###264 And his warm-ups are good enough for anything.
###267 ERIC KOSTON: And it wasn't about me coming out this
###270 gnarly part.
###271 It was gonna be more fun.
###272 And I'd never really filmed all the
###274 stuff when I fuck around.
###276 There'd be occasional things here and there.
###278 I thought it would just be kind of fun to just have
###281 everything.
###283 [INAUDIBLE]
###283 the wackiest shit that I can kind of do.
###287 MALE SPEAKER: Mm-hmm.
###288 ERIC KOSTON: All into the one part.
###290 MIKE CARROLL: That's one of his fucking sickest parts
###292 right there, is Chomp on This.
###293 That's Eric.
###294 And that's him fucking around.
###296 And that's him.
###297 That's most of his personality.
###299 It's not just stale and just skateboarding.
###303 SAM SMYTH: If he wants to make fun of some trick that
###307 somebody did, maybe worked really hard at it and it was
###311 just fucking gross, he could just do it first try.
###314 Just to make fun of it.
###316 He's just freestyling.
###318 Like rap freestyling, but on board.
###321 A lot of that stuff in Chomp where he's just dorking
###323 around, that's just coming to him.
###326 ATIBA JEFFERSON: His Chomp part on YouTube, it has like 1
###329 million views.
###330 That's a dork video part.
###333 The manual line, to me, it's ridiculous.
###336 That just shows the skill level of that dude is kind of
###340 beyond most skaters.
###344 MIKE CARROLL: He's just an insane skater.
###346 So when he grew up, he learned every fucking trick.
###349 He had those tricks.
###350 He just never put them in a video part or anything.
###354 It's insane how much he can just fuck around on
###356 skateboard.
###359 And just have fun.
###360 It's pretty fun.
###362 I get pretty jealous of that.
###363 
###370 ERIC KOSTON: [YELLING]
###372 TY EVANS: The dude's capable of doing so many cool things.
###375 And even for the video we're working on now, Spike
###379 said it, I said it.
###379 We're all just like, dude, do dork tricks.
###381 Don't even do the hardest, newest trick.
###384 Just do like a cool, fun part.
###386 MALE SPEAKER: Does that stuff come quick for him?
###388 TY EVANS: Back then it did.
###390 Back then all that stuff was quick.
###393 ATIBA JEFFERSON: That was such a fun time.
###394 And this point we were all skating a lot.
###396 And I remember we were on a trip in Miami.
###399 It was me, Eric, McCrank, Ty.
###403 And I remember it was like, oh.
###405 If you guys aren't going to get shit, we're
###408 going to get shit.
###409 And you're going to film us.
###412 MALE SPEAKER: Say something to start off your section.
###414 ATIBA JEFFERSON: I'm not going to have a section.
###417 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, see.
###418 That just started it right there.
###419 ATIBA JEFFERSON: Eric filmed a good amount of my video part.
###423 We're not good at skating.
###425 So a line is ours.
###428 And I remember Eric after I finally made mine.
###431 He just lays on the ground like, I'm
###433 gonna be so sore tomorrow.
###435 Like just miserable.
###436 [LAUGHTER]
###437 ATIBA JEFFERSON: I remember being like, sorry, dude.
###439 Fuck.
###439 I fucked up Koston.
###441 ERIC KOSTON: I filmed a lot of everybody else's parts.
###444 Like Ako's, and Atiba's, and Ty's.
###446 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###447 ERIC KOSTON: But it was about those guys more.
###449 But it was just kind of the bros and making it fun.
###454 TY EVANS: We all had little handycams filming each other.
###456 And it was just like, all right.
###457 Just make a fucking stupid, fun video.
###460 I think that's what's funny now is
###462 about with social media.
###464 Kids see every little thing of any skater they
###468 want to know about.
###469 Or any person for that matter.
###470 Whereas back then, you didn't see as much of people.
###473 So it's a video like Chomp kind of had some more of that
###477 stuff that you normally wouldn't see.
###479 We are all young, free-spirited, drinking.
###483 No restrictions.
###484 Having fun.
###487 ATIBA JEFFERSON: Crips and Bloods party.
###489 No one had wives, and kids, and serious responsibilities.
###494 We were going out.
###496 All the party footage.
###498 The GG Allin footage.
###501 That's one of the funniest Halloweens I've ever had.
###504 Anything with costume, he killed it.
###507 This is the infamous GG night.
###510 Look at how young everyone looks.
###513 He was GG Allin for that Halloween.
###514 AARON MEZA: After that video came out, I got a message from
###518 Jake Phelps.
###519 I forget what he said, but he's like--
###520 he just went on a rant about that video.
###523 He had just saw it.
###525 His shit's kinda weak.
###526 Then Koston's gonna be fucking coming at GG like that.
###529 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###531 
###534 ERIC KOSTON: I fell on my face.
###538 ATIBA JEFFERSON: It was super fun because it started as like
###541 kind of this joke thing.
###543 And then it turned into, let's do this video.
###545 And then it was like, let's get the stickers and t-shirts.
###550 And those guys would put it on their boards and wear it.
###552 It was kind of fun to sit back and watch people really be
###555 like, what is this?
###556 Is this a new company?
###557 What is this gonna be?
###558
