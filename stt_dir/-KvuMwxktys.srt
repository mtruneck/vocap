[TATTOO GUN BUZZING]


2
0:0:11,132 --> 0:0:13,73
DAN SANTORO: I did a gecko and
I started shading outside of


3
0:0:13,73 --> 0:0:16,4
it because I did
the line work.


4
0:0:16,4 --> 0:0:18,7
And then I jumped
onto the shader.


5
0:0:18,7 --> 0:0:19,91
And I had lime green.


6
0:0:19,91 --> 0:0:22,23
And let's say this
is the gecko.


7
0:0:22,23 --> 0:0:25,1
I wasn't looking and I
just went like this.


8
0:0:25,1 --> 0:0:27,6
And just the way I was
stretching, I thought this was


9
0:0:27,6 --> 0:0:29,9
inside the gecko.


10
0:0:29,9 --> 0:0:32,63
So I just started whip-shading
lime green.


11
0:0:32,63 --> 0:0:36,9
And then I pulled my hand away
and there was this giant green


12
0:0:36,9 --> 0:0:37,2
whip shade marks.


13
0:0:37,2 --> 0:0:38,27
And they guy didn't
see it, though.


14
0:0:38,27 --> 0:0:41,176
So I was like, yo, man.


15
0:0:41,176 --> 0:0:43,14
You know what would
look real cool?


16
0:0:43,14 --> 0:0:45,205
If this thing was sitting
on some leaves.


17
0:0:45,205 --> 0:0:46,235
And he was like, yeah.


18
0:0:46,235 --> 0:0:48,39
I was like, I'm not going
to charge you, man.


19
0:0:48,39 --> 0:0:51,75
He's like, yeah, I'd
love some leaves.


20
0:0:51,75 --> 0:0:52,75
So I just put a big
leaf there.


21
0:0:52,75 --> 0:1:10,7



22
0:1:10,7 --> 0:1:12,97
BERT KRAK: Dan has a very
distinct style that, usually,


23
0:1:12,97 --> 0:1:15,85
when you see it, you can
tell it's his own.


24
0:1:15,85 --> 0:1:20,63



25
0:1:20,63 --> 0:1:23,16
Dan's approach is
just different.


26
0:1:23,16 --> 0:1:24,41
And it's unique.


27
0:1:24,41 --> 0:1:34,71



28
0:1:34,71 --> 0:1:35,57
We're all special.


29
0:1:35,57 --> 0:1:38,2
Dan's just a little extra
special, you know?


30
0:1:38,2 --> 0:1:42,8
He's into, obviously,
tattooing, music--


31
0:1:42,8 --> 0:1:44,25
DAN SANTORO: The new
Inquisition record.


32
0:1:44,25 --> 0:1:45,83
This is the shit, right here.


33
0:1:45,83 --> 0:1:48,65
BERT KRAK: He's into painting.


34
0:1:48,65 --> 0:1:51,15
And that's with brushes
or aerosol.


35
0:1:51,15 --> 0:1:54,46
He's also into collecting
and antiquing.


36
0:1:54,46 --> 0:1:57,52
Oh, he's extremely
well-rounded.


37
0:1:57,52 --> 0:1:58,26
DAN SANTORO: It's confusing.


38
0:1:58,26 --> 0:2:0,78
It's a cultural identity
issue.


39
0:2:0,78 --> 0:2:5,91
I'm almost overly exposed
to things.


40
0:2:5,91 --> 0:2:7,43
I have so many friends
that are into so


41
0:2:7,43 --> 0:2:8,86
much interesting stuff.


42
0:2:8,86 --> 0:2:12,3
And I've manage to find merit
in almost everything.


43
0:2:12,3 --> 0:2:15,66
Luckily, I've really kind of
cultivated what I like the


44
0:2:15,66 --> 0:2:17,396
most about things that I like.


45
0:2:17,396 --> 0:2:19,586
And I've kind of made it work.


46
0:2:19,586 --> 0:2:22,106
The shop I work at now is Smith
Street Tattoo Parlour.


47
0:2:22,106 --> 0:2:34,97



48
0:2:34,97 --> 0:2:35,96
STEVE BOLTZ: There's four
of us working at


49
0:2:35,96 --> 0:2:36,99
Smith Street Tattoo.


50
0:2:36,99 --> 0:2:42,14
It's me, Bert Krak, Eli
Quinters, and Dan Santoro.


51
0:2:42,14 --> 0:2:44,88
Me, Eli, and Bert opened the
place sort of together, and


52
0:2:44,88 --> 0:2:46,3
then Dan joined us about
a year later.


53
0:2:46,3 --> 0:2:47,93
But Dan was always
in the plan.


54
0:2:47,93 --> 0:2:50,2
Dan was like our fourth guy.


55
0:2:50,2 --> 0:2:51,31
DAN SANTORO: I was at Adorned.


56
0:2:51,31 --> 0:2:55,86
And at the time that Smith
Street was even a twinkle in


57
0:2:55,86 --> 0:2:58,19
any of their eyes, I
was around a lot.


58
0:2:58,19 --> 0:2:59,87
I was spending a lot
of time at Steve's.


59
0:2:59,87 --> 0:3:3,7
A lot of nights, get off work,
hop on the train, go over to


60
0:3:3,7 --> 0:3:6,19
Steve's, have a couple cold
boys, some painting.


61
0:3:6,19 --> 0:3:9,72
So around that time, Steve had
mentioned something that he


62
0:3:9,72 --> 0:3:13,28
was walking his dog in the
neighborhood and he saw this


63
0:3:13,28 --> 0:3:16,19
storefront that looked like it
had been vacant for some time.


64
0:3:16,19 --> 0:3:18,54
And how he thought it was a
really cool block, right by


65
0:3:18,54 --> 0:3:20,8
the train, and all this
stuff like that.


66
0:3:20,8 --> 0:3:22,68
And he said he was going
to look into it.


67
0:3:22,68 --> 0:3:24,53
I was scared to say
yes at first.


68
0:3:24,53 --> 0:3:27,44
I didn't know Smith Street
was going to be as


69
0:3:27,44 --> 0:3:29,6
amazing as it is.


70
0:3:29,6 --> 0:3:30,2
I mean, I should have known.


71
0:3:30,2 --> 0:3:30,66
But I didn't.


72
0:3:30,66 --> 0:3:32,29
And I thought about it
for like a week.


73
0:3:32,29 --> 0:3:33,52
And then I was like,
you know what?


74
0:3:33,52 --> 0:3:34,3
I'm just going to do it.


75
0:3:34,3 --> 0:3:37,67
I'm pretty impulsive
and whatever.


76
0:3:37,67 --> 0:3:38,97
So I'm just going to do it.


77
0:3:38,97 --> 0:3:42,47
It's just one of those things
where the planets aligned for


78
0:3:42,47 --> 0:3:42,95
Smith Street.


79
0:3:42,95 --> 0:3:44,78
We were all friends.


80
0:3:44,78 --> 0:3:48,58
Dream situation for me, working
with these guys.


81
0:3:48,58 --> 0:3:49,83
BERT KRAK: This is 100%
our clubhouse.


82
0:3:49,83 --> 0:3:52,91



83
0:3:52,91 --> 0:3:55,68
I never feel, driving here
from Queens, like


84
0:3:55,68 --> 0:3:56,43
I'm going to work.


85
0:3:56,43 --> 0:3:58,56
I always feel like I'm coming
here to hang out with my


86
0:3:58,56 --> 0:4:1,14
friends and have a good time.


87
0:4:1,14 --> 0:4:3,53
DAN SANTORO: I think Eli's
closer to Steve.


88
0:4:3,53 --> 0:4:7,11
And me and Bert, I think, might
be a little similar.


89
0:4:7,11 --> 0:4:8,3
We exchanged birthday tattoos.


90
0:4:8,3 --> 0:4:9,69
We have the same birthday.


91
0:4:9,69 --> 0:4:13,71
So we actually did little Cancer
crabs on each other on


92
0:4:13,71 --> 0:4:15,13
one of our birthdays.


93
0:4:15,13 --> 0:4:17,69
Bert absolutely loves
the fact that we're


94
0:4:17,69 --> 0:4:19,4
born on the same day.


95
0:4:19,4 --> 0:4:21,14
He brings up about
once a week.


96
0:4:21,14 --> 0:4:23,57
BERT KRAK: I was born
July 12, '77.


97
0:4:23,57 --> 0:4:28,38
I believe he's July 12, '83.


98
0:4:28,38 --> 0:4:30,23
I'm very much a Cancer.


99
0:4:30,23 --> 0:4:31,0
So is he.


100
0:4:31,0 --> 0:4:34,5
You know, hard on the outside,
soft on the inside.


101
0:4:34,5 --> 0:4:36,99
We're both really sensitive.


102
0:4:36,99 --> 0:4:41,62
It wouldn't take much to really
ruffle our feathers.


103
0:4:41,62 --> 0:4:43,41
No, there was already
graffiti, dude.


104
0:4:43,41 --> 0:4:45,28
DAN SANTORO: Of course, but yo--
but there's not already


105
0:4:45,28 --> 0:4:47,41
tags all over the fucking
walls in here.


106
0:4:47,41 --> 0:4:48,96
All right, we're not having
a fucking moral


107
0:4:48,96 --> 0:4:50,986
conversation right now.


108
0:4:50,986 --> 0:4:53,63
It's the dumbest shit ever.


109
0:4:53,63 --> 0:4:55,48
STEVE BOLTZ: Before Dan
came on, I was kind


110
0:4:55,48 --> 0:4:56,9
of the loose cannon.


111
0:4:56,9 --> 0:4:58,71
Because I'm a little
bit messy.


112
0:4:58,71 --> 0:5:0,58
I definitely can be
a loud mouth.


113
0:5:0,58 --> 0:5:3,31
And, maybe in a different way,
Dan's now the loose cannon.


114
0:5:3,31 --> 0:5:6,161
He's just a pathological
thinker, you know?


115
0:5:6,161 --> 0:5:6,81
DAN SANTORO: I don't know.


116
0:5:6,81 --> 0:5:9,11
It's like when you go to Walmart
and you see the old


117
0:5:9,11 --> 0:5:13,41
lady with the puffy, pink,
patch sweatshirt.


118
0:5:13,41 --> 0:5:15,63
You know the feeling you get?


119
0:5:15,63 --> 0:5:17,87
That's how I feel sometimes
when people bring certain


120
0:5:17,87 --> 0:5:19,58
tattoos in.


121
0:5:19,58 --> 0:5:20,895
I really want to give
it to them.


122
0:5:20,895 --> 0:5:22,645
And I want to make
it really good.


123
0:5:22,645 --> 0:5:23,12
All right.


124
0:5:23,12 --> 0:5:25,42
So I get a phone call.


125
0:5:25,42 --> 0:5:27,84
And this woman's like,
we have this woman.


126
0:5:27,84 --> 0:5:29,74
She wants to get tattooed.


127
0:5:29,74 --> 0:5:31,14
I think she got--


128
0:5:31,14 --> 0:5:33,77
I think it was Charlie Brown,
if I'm not mistaken.


129
0:5:33,77 --> 0:5:36,675
And she's going like, aargh.


130
0:5:36,675 --> 0:5:38,68
And she's shaking her leg.


131
0:5:38,68 --> 0:5:41,16
Within three lines, the
tattoo is so fucked.


132
0:5:41,16 --> 0:5:43,16
So I was just like--


133
0:5:43,16 --> 0:5:43,775
dude.


134
0:5:43,775 --> 0:5:44,965
It was like being on a ride.


135
0:5:44,965 --> 0:5:46,602
I was just like.


136
0:5:46,602 --> 0:5:48,616
And I did it.


137
0:5:48,616 --> 0:5:52,37
ELI QUINTERS: Nothing's ever
set in stone with Santoro.


138
0:5:52,37 --> 0:5:55,89
Dan seems to be definitely
the least


139
0:5:55,89 --> 0:5:57,84
organized out of everybody.


140
0:5:57,84 --> 0:6:1,51
STEVE BOLTZ: Dan also has the
same mentality, as far as


141
0:6:1,51 --> 0:6:2,49
that's our job and
making tattoos.


142
0:6:2,49 --> 0:6:4,62
But Dan just does everything
by the seat of his pants.


143
0:6:4,62 --> 0:6:7,22
And I think that the whole
seat-of-the-pants or


144
0:6:7,22 --> 0:6:11,45
unpreparedness or whatever, I
think he subconsciously is


145
0:6:11,45 --> 0:6:12,7
that way on purpose.


146
0:6:12,7 --> 0:6:15,12



147
0:6:15,12 --> 0:6:17,53
The way he tattoos, there's
a lot of confidence.


148
0:6:17,53 --> 0:6:22,24
And even very simple, clunky
tattoos just look so good.


149
0:6:22,24 --> 0:6:24,56
ELI QUINTERS: He's one of
my favorites, for sure.


150
0:6:24,56 --> 0:6:26,29
It's traditional, real


151
0:6:26,29 --> 0:6:29,98
stripped-down, real bare bones.


152
0:6:29,98 --> 0:6:32,64
I would say he's a little
looser than maybe I am.


153
0:6:32,64 --> 0:6:36,96
I really try to do a very exact
line and everything.


154
0:6:36,96 --> 0:6:39,32
And he recently moved
me away from that.


155
0:6:39,32 --> 0:6:42,44
He's made me loosen up a lot.


156
0:6:42,44 --> 0:6:45,41
I think he's kind of got a lot
of what Dan Higgs had in that


157
0:6:45,41 --> 0:6:49,77
he knows just how to put down a
line and just do the tattoo.


158
0:6:49,77 --> 0:6:51,335
And it comes out--


159
0:6:51,335 --> 0:6:52,6
I don't know.


160
0:6:52,6 --> 0:6:53,31
It looks great.


161
0:6:53,31 --> 0:6:55,32



162
0:6:55,32 --> 0:6:59,68
He can make something look
pretty and delicate and all


163
0:6:59,68 --> 0:7:1,62
those things, but they
still have that


164
0:7:1,62 --> 0:7:2,87
Santoro look to them.


165
0:7:2,87 --> 0:7:7,84



166
0:7:7,84 --> 0:7:10,32
BERT KRAK: Me and Dan,
we do a lot of really


167
0:7:10,32 --> 0:7:11,97
kind of bold tattooing.


168
0:7:11,97 --> 0:7:13,97
But it doesn't mean
that Eli and Steve


169
0:7:13,97 --> 0:7:16,7
can't do the same thing.


170
0:7:16,7 --> 0:7:19,15
We're a team.


171
0:7:19,15 --> 0:7:21,37
DAN SANTORO: Almost every tattoo
that gets done, good or


172
0:7:21,37 --> 0:7:23,89
bad, we show off
to each other.


173
0:7:23,89 --> 0:7:25,75
I think that's a really
good thing.


174
0:7:25,75 --> 0:7:29,17
I've worked in shops where I
couldn't even tell you the


175
0:7:29,17 --> 0:7:31,645
last tattoo I saw of an
artist for months.


176
0:7:31,645 --> 0:7:32,75
You know what I mean?


177
0:7:32,75 --> 0:7:35,37
You just kind of work in your
little corner of the shop,


178
0:7:35,37 --> 0:7:38,97
finish a tattoo, put a bandage
on it, see you later.


179
0:7:38,97 --> 0:7:40,4
There's no fun in that.


180
0:7:40,4 --> 0:7:41,97
I mean, I want to see it.


181
0:7:41,97 --> 0:7:43,42
I want to see what
you're doing.


182
0:7:43,42 --> 0:7:45,12
I want to see if you did
something that maybe I


183
0:7:45,12 --> 0:7:46,63
should've been thinking about.


184
0:7:46,63 --> 0:7:48,71
We bite the hell out of each
other, but it's cool.


185
0:7:48,71 --> 0:7:51,23
We work together.


186
0:7:51,23 --> 0:7:52,48
That's why we're there.


187
0:7:52,48 --> 0:7:58,756



188
0:7:58,756 --> 0:8:0,56
FERGUS SIMMS: These guys are
just doing the best of the


189
0:8:0,56 --> 0:8:2,76
tattoos around, in my opinion.


190
0:8:2,76 --> 0:8:6,53
It's the best shop in the world
by far, for the style


191
0:8:6,53 --> 0:8:8,35
especially.


192
0:8:8,35 --> 0:8:10,8
We've been planning this
trip for a while


193
0:8:10,8 --> 0:8:11,33
from Melbourne, Australia.


194
0:8:11,33 --> 0:8:11,72
I don't know.


195
0:8:11,72 --> 0:8:14,65
We saved up for six, seven
months or so, and then bought


196
0:8:14,65 --> 0:8:15,98
tickets and came.


197
0:8:15,98 --> 0:8:17,55
We haven't done too much
tourist stuff yet.


198
0:8:17,55 --> 0:8:19,8
We've just kind of been
sitting in the shop.


199
0:8:19,8 --> 0:8:22,62
I think we're up to 11
now, and then got a


200
0:8:22,62 --> 0:8:24,77
couple more on Tuesday.


201
0:8:24,77 --> 0:8:28,25
So this one's from Steve.


202
0:8:28,25 --> 0:8:30,61
And from Dan.


203
0:8:30,61 --> 0:8:33,51
This one's from Dan as well--
cool little cat.


204
0:8:33,51 --> 0:8:38,52
Got the dagger skull from Dan
and little crying hema heart


205
0:8:38,52 --> 0:8:39,75
from Dan as well.


206
0:8:39,75 --> 0:8:41,864
And that one's from Steve.


207
0:8:41,864 --> 0:8:43,83
STEVE BOLTZ: It's just like a
kind of a special thing at


208
0:8:43,83 --> 0:8:47,4
Smith Street because we all do
anything, but we all basically


209
0:8:47,4 --> 0:8:48,17
do the same thing, too.


210
0:8:48,17 --> 0:8:50,79
And people don't necessarily ask
or say, that looks like a


211
0:8:50,79 --> 0:8:54,12
Steve Boltz tattoo or a Bert
Krak tattoo so much anymore as


212
0:8:54,12 --> 0:8:55,88
they might say, that looks like
a Smith Street tattoo.


213
0:8:55,88 --> 0:8:57,77
And I hear that and I love it.


214
0:8:57,77 --> 0:9:0,13
If you come to the shop and
I'm not there, you're not


215
0:9:0,13 --> 0:9:3,0
afraid to sit in Dan's chair
or Eli's chair because you


216
0:9:3,0 --> 0:9:5,17
know that you're going to get
basically the same product.


217
0:9:5,17 --> 0:9:16,23



218
0:9:16,23 --> 0:9:19,55
We very consciously want our
tattoos to look a certain way.


219
0:9:19,55 --> 0:9:21,32
And New York is part of that.


220
0:9:21,32 --> 0:9:22,52
New York's a very


221
0:9:22,52 --> 0:9:24,79
straightforward approach to living.


222
0:9:24,79 --> 0:9:26,18
There's no fucking around.


223
0:9:26,18 --> 0:9:28,32
And I think in tattooing, maybe
there's a similar thing


224
0:9:28,32 --> 0:9:30,56
whereas it's a very
straightforward look to


225
0:9:30,56 --> 0:9:35,11
tattoos as opposed to it being
fancier or more artistic.


226
0:9:35,11 --> 0:9:36,91
Hey, we want our tattoos
to look classic.


227
0:9:36,91 --> 0:9:38,94
We don't want them
to look dated.


228
0:9:38,94 --> 0:9:42,37
And when somebody comes and
wants an owl on their chest,


229
0:9:42,37 --> 0:9:44,5
it's like, why don't you
just get a fucking


230
0:9:44,5 --> 0:9:45,21
eagle on your chest?


231
0:9:45,21 --> 0:9:47,68
Why do you got to get an owl?


232
0:9:47,68 --> 0:9:49,315
The technical application
is what will make a


233
0:9:49,315 --> 0:9:51,684
tattoo slick, to me.


234
0:9:51,684 --> 0:9:55,5
It's a good thing to just be
able to give somebody a nice


235
0:9:55,5 --> 0:9:58,59
solid, clean, predictable
tattoo.


236
0:9:58,59 --> 0:9:59,53
That's a good thing.


237
0:9:59,53 --> 0:10:2,76
And even if it's a tattoo that
50 people have, its new and


238
0:10:2,76 --> 0:10:6,33
it's original because you have
to put your hand to it.


239
0:10:6,33 --> 0:10:8,97



240
0:10:8,97 --> 0:10:12,68
ELI QUINTERS: We're all really
going for the tattoo style.


241
0:10:12,68 --> 0:10:16,45
We want our tattoos to
look like tattoos.


242
0:10:16,45 --> 0:10:19,16
When you're a little kid and you
think about what a tattoo


243
0:10:19,16 --> 0:10:22,61
is, the first thing for myself
and I think a lot of people


244
0:10:22,61 --> 0:10:26,6
that popped into their head are
the anchors like Popeye


245
0:10:26,6 --> 0:10:28,77
had, or even a Mom heart
or something like that.


246
0:10:28,77 --> 0:10:31,73
Just something that would almost
be represented in a


247
0:10:31,73 --> 0:10:33,84
cartoon, so to speak.


248
0:10:33,84 --> 0:10:36,31
What you picture in your head
when somebody says the word


249
0:10:36,31 --> 0:10:41,5
"tattoo" is usually some sort
of tattoo imagery, not some


250
0:10:41,5 --> 0:10:43,0
no-outline, color
portrait thing.


251
0:10:43,0 --> 0:10:44,57
You know what I mean?


252
0:10:44,57 --> 0:10:46,23
So, I mean, I think
that's probably


253
0:10:46,23 --> 0:10:48,3
unifying in that terms.


254
0:10:48,3 --> 0:10:52,31
We use a bold outline and
a lot of black shading.


255
0:10:52,31 --> 0:10:54,63
We have a lot of the same
reference material.


256
0:10:54,63 --> 0:10:59,4
Tattooing is an art and its
form is this traditional,


257
0:10:59,4 --> 0:11:2,84
almost sailor-style tattooing.


258
0:11:2,84 --> 0:11:5,98
DAN SANTORO: I guess maybe I
started tattooing late enough.


259
0:11:5,98 --> 0:11:11,8
There was still enough going on
with people wanting to do


260
0:11:11,8 --> 0:11:14,28
traditional stuff that
I was like, OK.


261
0:11:14,28 --> 0:11:17,0
I know I want my tattoos to
look like that, but how?


262
0:11:17,0 --> 0:11:21,4
And then I was finding the Dan
Higgs tattoos that were in


263
0:11:21,4 --> 0:11:22,62
"Tattoo Time."


264
0:11:22,62 --> 0:11:24,645
"Tattoo Time" was a publication
that Ed Hardy put


265
0:11:24,645 --> 0:11:28,93
of from early '80s probably to
the early '90s that had the


266
0:11:28,93 --> 0:11:31,19
weirdo art section.


267
0:11:31,19 --> 0:11:34,11
And they were just really
strange tattoos, but they


268
0:11:34,11 --> 0:11:38,4
still had that traditional
application that I was looking


269
0:11:38,4 --> 0:11:41,37
for in anything, really.


270
0:11:41,37 --> 0:11:43,77
I'd see tattoos and not really
know why I liked them.


271
0:11:43,77 --> 0:11:45,31
But I knew I just liked them.


272
0:11:45,31 --> 0:11:47,71
And then I'd realize down
the road, oh, it's


273
0:11:47,71 --> 0:11:49,44
because they're bold.


274
0:11:49,44 --> 0:11:51,22
And they're simple.
