Last March, champion race
car driver Jeff Gordon

JACOB SOBOROFF: This thing
has over 40 million views.


12
0:0:26,63 --> 0:0:28,799
However, some-- Travis
Okulski-- questioned

0:0:28,799 --> 0:0:29,84
the stunt's authenticity.

started to suspect about

on the second viewing.

JACOB SOBOROFF: So
almost a year later,


17
0:0:33,975 --> 0:0:36,32
Jeff went back undercover
as an ex-con taxi driver


18
0:0:36,32 --> 0:0:38,16
to prove to Travis
that he ain't no phony.


19

JED MCGIFFIN: It was a
transition, a transformation.
