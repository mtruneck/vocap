###14 JOSH KALIS: My pops was moving from
###16 Michigan to Dallas, Texas.
###19 And they didn't want me to be part of the move, because I
###22 was a bit of a troublemaker.
###24 So him and my mom, who lived in New York at the time, sent
###27 me to skateboard camp at Woodward.
###30 And it was there that I met Tony Mag and filmed a couple
###34 things while at Woodward.
###36 And then he was like, hey, we're going to
###37 put you on H Street.
###38 And that was it.
###40 Dude, I was super psyched.
###43 I was hyped to get on, but at the same time it was like all
###46 my favorite skaters, Mike Carroll and Sean Sheffey and
###50 Sal Barbier and all the illest dudes rode for H Street.
###54 And they all left right as I got on.
###57 So I was kind of like, well.
###59 I didn't really give a shit, man.
###60 I was getting free H Street boards.
###62 That was tight.
###64 At some point, my mom moved from New York to Philly.
###67 And when I would visit her, I would go skate the city.
###70 And this was before me and Stevie really--
###73 we were just little skater dudes.
###75 STEVIE WILLIAMS: Oh, man.
###76 The first time I met Josh, I was with my cousin Russell and
###81 my man Terrence.
###82 And we were skating this skate spot called Rat Curves.
###87 And Bam Margera and Mike Maldonado used to skate for H
###91 Street back in the day.
###92 They showed up.
###93 It was like Mike, Bam, Bam's brother, Bam's dad, and Josh.
###98 And they introduced us, like, oh, this is Josh.
###101 He's from outside of Philly.
###103 He skates for H Street.
###104 We were like, what?
###105 That's dope.
###105 And he was good.
###106 But I never really tripped off of it until he came to LOVE
###110 and started skating.
###112 And that's when I seen him skate.
###113 I was like, damn, that dude is sick.
###115 And for some reason me and him just hit it off.
###118 I was good and he was good, but I never even heard of him
###120 before, though.
###121 I was probably like 11 years old.
###124 JOSH KALIS: What would you call this?
###125 MALE SPEAKER: A shrine.
###126 JOSH KALIS: Shrine?
###128 My LOVE shrine?
###129 Does it look like a shrine?
###132 It does, huh?
###133 Damn.
###135 I wasn't really going for the shrine look.
###139 We skated together all the time.
###141 And we just clicked at LOVE.
###143 STEVIE WILLIAMS: Coming downtown, I was looking
###145 forward to seeing Josh.
###147 That made me want to get sponsored.
###149 And he was already sponsored, so he would just give us
###151 boards, wheels.
###152 And one day we were skating, and I learned kickflip
###156 noseslides.
###157 And then he learned kickflip noseslides.
###159 Then he learned kickflip noseslides and
###160 ollie heel flip it.
###161 He had every trick.
###162 He could do everything.
###164 RICKY OYOLA: I don't know how Josh came.
###166 I don't know if it was a relative, or--
###168 but yeah, he came.
###169 And he was really good, man.
###172 He was really good.
###173 I wish dudes like that would skate our way, too.
###176 There still wasn't anybody who was exploring the city like we
###178 always did.
###180 JOSH KALIS: Top of the food chain in Philly was Ricky.
###183 I was definitely hierarchy shit.
###185 Because Ricky had rules where you couldn't film unless you
###190 were pushing switch switch.
###193 Like if you're doing switch mongo, you ain't fucking
###196 filming it at LOVE.
###197 That's when Ricky and those dudes ran LOVE.
###199 And they had their rules.
###201 And they had their whole thing.
###203 You know what I'm saying?
###204 At the time, the very first "TransWorld" article on
###208 Philadelphia was there then.
###210 And a few of us shot some stuff.
###212 And it was told, don't use that shit.
###216 DGK didn't exist for a while.
###219 And then he turned that other side of LOVE park into DGK,
###223 the Dirty Ghetto Kids.
###224 And it was because of that.
###225 STEVIE WILLIAMS: At that time, there was
###226 two different cliques.
###227 It was our clique, the DGK clique, and then it was Ricky
###232 Oyola and all of those dudes.
###234 RICKY OYOLA: I don't think a lot of those dudes, the DGK
###235 dudes, I don't think they liked the fact that Matt and I
###238 were the ones who were most known and Philadelphia was
###241 kind of ours.
###242 We created that.
###243 You know what I mean?
###245 So it was kind of ours in such a way.
###249 STEVIE WILLIAMS: Whoever came to Philly was supposed to hang
###252 with Ricky and Matt and all of them dudes.
###254 And, see, Fred Gall, when he came, he didn't come
###258 and hang with us.
###259 He went to hang with Ricky.
###260 And Josh was never their dude.
###261 Josh was like--
###263 he took to us.
###264 So every time he came to the city, he came over and
###267 chilled with us.
###267 MALE SPEAKER: [BEATBOXING].
###269 
###272 STEVIE WILLIAMS: He always had the swag, but he wasn't the
###274 white dude that tried to act black.
###276 He was just the white dude with swag.
###278 Everybody liked him, from white people to black people.
###280 The girls loved him.
###282 He was Josh.
###283 Everybody knew he had value.
###284 No matter what city he was in, he brought value to that city.
###288 At the end of the day, he was taking all their shine.
###292 And Ricky was supposed to be the king of Philly.
###294 And you got all of these dudes following his lead and shit.
###297 And then here come Josh that's like, I'm not
###300 following your lead.
###300 I'm actually rocking with the ghetto kids.
###303 And they definitely didn't like that shit.
###305 JOSH KALIS: Me and Ricky got along pretty good until he
###308 thought I fucked his ex-chick.
###311 And then that started up a whole fucking shit storm of
###314 beef between me and Ricky.
###317 And that carried to San Francisco.
###319 It carried all over the place.
###320 We had crazy beef.
###322 RICKY OYOLA: Yeah, yeah.
###323 There were some issues and stuff like that, some just
###327 stupid shit that went down.
###330 STEVIE WILLIAMS: I think just that situation was easier for
###333 Ricky to say, fuck you, Josh.
###334 Get out of my city.
###335 And Josh left.
###337 It wasn't like, we going to retaliate.
###340 Josh just left.
###341 And I was like, damn.
###342 There go our town hero, our dude to get our free boards.
###345 It was over.
###347 JOSH KALIS: Rumors were I wasn't allowed there.
###349 And I went back on that Invisible tour and was like,
###352 hey, bro, here I am.
###354 And Ricky was like, you know what, you're going
###356 to be pro, I'm pro.
###360 We shouldn't just fucking be at each other's
###361 throat every time.
###362 So just respect.
###364 If I'm here, don't be here.
###366 If you're here, I ain't coming in.
###368 And we just kind of rode it out like that for a while,
###370 until when I moved back to Philly then we squashed it.
###374 And Ricky found out I didn't fuck the chick and apologized.
###377 And it was all good.
###378 RICKY OYOLA: Look, I'm older now.
###379 And I just thought back.
###381 It was always kind of like this fake beef.
###383 Because it really wasn't any beef.
###386 There wasn't any.
###387 We're two different people.
###388 I'm from the woods.
###389 They're from the city.
###390 Skating was something we had in common.
###392 But we didn't skate the same way.
###394 And LOVE park was their playground that hooked them
###400 up, got them on DC.
###401 And look where they're at now.
###402 
###414 Just his tre flips--
###415 tre flips are my favorite trick.
###417 And he's seriously got tops.
###419 He's got one of the best ones ever, to tell you the truth.
###421 Stevie's got it also.
###422 Stevie's got a great switch flip.
###423 He's just really good.
###424 Josh's style is what I like more than anything.
###428 His big spins and tail slides--
###430 I wish I could do that shit.
###433 I mean, I don't want to spend two years
###434 trying to do it once.
###436 That's going to be a shitty two years of my skating.
###438 I might do it.
###439 But that's no fun.
###441
