1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:8,712



2
0:0:8,712 --> 0:0:12,84
SHANE SMITH: We came back from
Bulgaria blown away by our


3
0:0:12,84 --> 0:0:16,23
biggest story that we'd ever
done, feeling like we were 60


4
0:0:16,23 --> 0:0:17,65
Minutes or something.


5
0:0:17,65 --> 0:0:19,87
And we gave all the footage
to our editor Jake.


6
0:0:19,87 --> 0:0:23,33
And Jake was confused
and saddened and


7
0:0:23,33 --> 0:0:24,37
freaked out by it.


8
0:0:24,37 --> 0:0:26,7
So what we're going to do is go
through the whole editing


9
0:0:26,7 --> 0:0:28,26
process with Jake.


10
0:0:28,26 --> 0:0:30,542
JAKE BURGHART: Did you go
to Varna or Bapha first?


11
0:0:30,542 --> 0:0:32,32
SHANE SMITH: I don't
know what Bapha is.


12
0:0:32,32 --> 0:0:34,22
I think Bapha is Varna.


13
0:0:34,22 --> 0:0:37,6
That's sort of like that's
phonetic and that's English.


14
0:0:37,6 --> 0:0:38,82
So we should start there.


15
0:0:38,82 --> 0:0:42,8
We did an article in the
magazine about a French


16
0:0:42,8 --> 0:0:45,31
journalist who went to Bulgaria
and bought a warhead


17
0:0:45,31 --> 0:0:46,48
on the black market.


18
0:0:46,48 --> 0:0:50,3
We were so fascinated by this
that we decided to fly to


19
0:0:50,3 --> 0:0:52,4
Sofia and research
it ourselves.


20
0:0:52,4 --> 0:0:54,96
And when we were there, we met
this guy who'd written the


21
0:0:54,96 --> 0:0:56,685
first article about
it from Standart.


22
0:0:56,685 --> 0:0:59,63
He's an American dude,
but he's been living


23
0:0:59,63 --> 0:1:0,8
there for 10 years.


24
0:1:0,8 --> 0:1:3,39
MATTHEW BRUNWASSER: Every big
arms scandal that happened in


25
0:1:3,39 --> 0:1:4,78
the world had a Bulgarian
connection.


26
0:1:4,78 --> 0:1:5,41
SHANE SMITH: Sure.


27
0:1:5,41 --> 0:1:7,6
MATTHEW BRUNWASSER: They'd
find some box which said,


28
0:1:7,6 --> 0:1:8,375
these bullets were
made in Bulgaria.


29
0:1:8,375 --> 0:1:11,98
SHANE SMITH: He's the guy who
helped us find this Ivanov.


30
0:1:11,98 --> 0:1:15,19
It's not his right name,
Ivanov is like Smith.


31
0:1:15,19 --> 0:1:16,21
It's like, you don't
want anyone to


32
0:1:16,21 --> 0:1:17,63
know, like me, Smith--


33
0:1:17,63 --> 0:1:18,49
Ivanov.


34
0:1:18,49 --> 0:1:22,92
MATTHEW BRUNWASSER: I first
heard about Mr. Ivanov in


35
0:1:22,92 --> 0:1:26,98
2001, a couple months
after September 11.


36
0:1:26,98 --> 0:1:31,96
He is a former military
intelligence colonel.


37
0:1:31,96 --> 0:1:35,42
He went into private business
finding construction workers


38
0:1:35,42 --> 0:1:38,69
for the building industry
in Saudi Arabia.


39
0:1:38,69 --> 0:1:41,65
The bin Laden family's one the
most powerful in Saudi Arabia.


40
0:1:41,65 --> 0:1:43,68
And if you're going to do
construction work in Saudi


41
0:1:43,68 --> 0:1:45,44
Arabia, you're going
to work with them


42
0:1:45,44 --> 0:1:48,74
one way or the other.


43
0:1:48,74 --> 0:1:52,26
SHANE SMITH: We're interviewing
this dude who


44
0:1:52,26 --> 0:1:55,305
sold a warhead on the
black market.


45
0:1:55,305 --> 0:2:9,556



46
0:2:9,556 --> 0:2:14,13
We're here in Sliven, which
is in eastern Bulgaria.


47
0:2:14,13 --> 0:2:17,86
It used to be a Russian military
base where they have


48
0:2:17,86 --> 0:2:19,38
some arms dumps.


49
0:2:19,38 --> 0:2:23,33
Sliven is important because
it's the place where the


50
0:2:23,33 --> 0:2:24,94
French journalist bought
the warhead.


51
0:2:24,94 --> 0:2:26,17
It's where everything
went down.


52
0:2:26,17 --> 0:2:28,49
So we went there and are
researching and checking


53
0:2:28,49 --> 0:2:31,81
things out, and we get word
that Ivanov is actually in


54
0:2:31,81 --> 0:2:33,6
Sunny Beach.


55
0:2:33,6 --> 0:2:40,71



56
0:2:40,71 --> 0:2:42,23
We just got to Sunny Beach.


57
0:2:42,23 --> 0:2:44,78
We've been driving for six
hours, we're on the Black Sea.


58
0:2:44,78 --> 0:2:47,88
Apparently, Ivanov is here doing
a construction project


59
0:2:47,88 --> 0:2:49,29
for retirees.


60
0:2:49,29 --> 0:2:52,78
To him, there's no difference
between making Beverly Hills


61
0:2:52,78 --> 0:2:55,88
condos on the Black Sea
and selling warheads.


62
0:2:55,88 --> 0:2:57,32
Because it's all just
capitalism.


63
0:2:57,32 --> 0:2:58,57
It's just buying and selling.


64
0:2:58,57 --> 0:3:0,22
JAKE BURGHART: He's just out
in the open doing normal


65
0:3:0,22 --> 0:3:1,1
business now.


66
0:3:1,1 --> 0:3:1,84
SHANE SMITH: Definitely.


67
0:3:1,84 --> 0:3:4,84
JAKE BURGHART: Why would
he even talk to you?


68
0:3:4,84 --> 0:3:6,59
I mean, he's got his own
stuff going now.


69
0:3:6,59 --> 0:3:9,25
SHANE SMITH: Well, because
we gave him money.


70
0:3:9,25 --> 0:3:11,11
Again, everything's
very simple there.


71
0:3:11,11 --> 0:3:13,48
It's capitalism, it's
just like you want


72
0:3:13,48 --> 0:3:14,99
anything, pay for it.


73
0:3:14,99 --> 0:3:18,7
The mentality is selling women,
selling drugs, selling


74
0:3:18,7 --> 0:3:21,4
guns, selling condos, selling
cars, selling houses--


75
0:3:21,4 --> 0:3:22,57
it doesn't matter.


76
0:3:22,57 --> 0:3:26,32
And the attitude, too, is this
is your system, it's your


77
0:3:26,32 --> 0:3:27,5
capitalism.


78
0:3:27,5 --> 0:3:28,64
How can you look down
your noses at


79
0:3:28,64 --> 0:3:29,82
us for selling warheads?


80
0:3:29,82 --> 0:3:30,62
That's what you do.


81
0:3:30,62 --> 0:3:32,91
Warheads are worth money, and
therefore we sell them.


82
0:3:32,91 --> 0:3:33,54
EDDY MORETTI: So what's better,


83
0:3:33,54 --> 0:3:34,79
capitalism or communism?


84
0:3:34,79 --> 0:3:53,18



85
0:3:53,18 --> 0:3:55,89
SHANE SMITH: And would you say
this is the largest investment


86
0:3:55,89 --> 0:3:57,89
of foreign capital in
Bulgaria right now?


87
0:3:57,89 --> 0:4:2,565



88
0:4:2,565 --> 0:4:4,12
SHANE SMITH: What's
the property tax


89
0:4:4,12 --> 0:4:5,22
situation in Bulgaria?


90
0:4:5,22 --> 0:4:6,73
Once you buy, you
have to pay tax?


91
0:4:6,73 --> 0:4:14,735



92
0:4:14,735 --> 0:4:17,0
SHANE SMITH: As we're talking to
him about his construction


93
0:4:17,0 --> 0:4:21,7
project, which actually has
a lot of Kuwaiti and Saudi


94
0:4:21,7 --> 0:4:25,33
Arabian investment, the topic of
the Bin Laden Construction


95
0:4:25,33 --> 0:4:26,68
Company came up.


96
0:4:26,68 --> 0:4:28,77
And he said look, if we're going
to talk about this any


97
0:4:28,77 --> 0:4:31,24
more, we have to go back to your
hotel where we can film


98
0:4:31,24 --> 0:4:32,16
in private.


99
0:4:32,16 --> 0:4:34,59
And I want my face blurred
and my voice distorted.


100
0:4:34,59 --> 0:4:36,0
And we said, OK, let's go.


101
0:4:36,0 --> 0:4:56,782



102
0:4:56,782 --> 0:5:1,665
SHANE SMITH: Not the daddy bin
Laden, Osama bin Laden.


103
0:5:1,665 --> 0:5:3,8
SHANE SMITH: And what
did he want?


104
0:5:3,8 --> 0:5:17,365



105
0:5:17,365 --> 0:5:20,24
SHANE SMITH: So what they asked
him for was to set up a


106
0:5:20,24 --> 0:5:23,89
waste management company that
would get the contract to deal


107
0:5:23,89 --> 0:5:27,68
with the radioactive waste from
Kozloduy, which is the


108
0:5:27,68 --> 0:5:30,24
big Bulgarian nuclear
power station.


109
0:5:30,24 --> 0:5:32,27
They asked him to get this
waste management


110
0:5:32,27 --> 0:5:33,59
company, he's like why?


111
0:5:33,59 --> 0:5:36,606
And they're like, well,
we want to get waste.


112
0:5:36,606 --> 0:5:38,56
That's me being an Arab.


113
0:5:38,56 --> 0:5:40,27
And then he said, but why?


114
0:5:40,27 --> 0:5:41,79
Why don't you get
the real thing?


115
0:5:41,79 --> 0:5:44,9
And they're like, real thing?


116
0:5:44,9 --> 0:5:47,62
And that's how the French guy
found out that real thing,


117
0:5:47,62 --> 0:5:48,87
meaning the warhead.


118
0:5:48,87 --> 0:6:10,99



119
0:6:10,99 --> 0:6:13,77
SHANE SMITH: So they brought
in Fedor Patchenko, who was


120
0:6:13,77 --> 0:6:16,74
the ex-Vice Director of the
Soviet atomic program, to


121
0:6:16,74 --> 0:6:18,26
verify that it was real.


122
0:6:18,26 --> 0:6:21,66



123
0:6:21,66 --> 0:6:24,39
SHANE SMITH: When you actually
see the footage of the


124
0:6:24,39 --> 0:6:27,24
detonator, you're like, they
don't need to get shitty


125
0:6:27,24 --> 0:6:27,87
radioactive waste.


126
0:6:27,87 --> 0:6:32,51
They can buy a plutonium
detonator on the black market.


127
0:6:32,51 --> 0:6:35,35
So that's when you're
like holy shit,


128
0:6:35,35 --> 0:6:36,57
holy shit, holy shit.


129
0:6:36,57 --> 0:6:39,64
JAKE BURGHART: So is it called a
dirty bomb because it's made


130
0:6:39,64 --> 0:6:40,455
with waste?


131
0:6:40,455 --> 0:6:42,5
SHANE SMITH: Yes.


132
0:6:42,5 --> 0:6:45,74
So let's say you set off a dirty
bomb made out of cesium


133
0:6:45,74 --> 0:6:48,37
or something, some radioactive
material, in New York.


134
0:6:48,37 --> 0:6:49,74
It wouldn't kill that
many people.


135
0:6:49,74 --> 0:6:51,55
Maybe it would kill a couple
thousand people.


136
0:6:51,55 --> 0:6:54,7
But it would irradiate all of
Manhattan, so everyone would


137
0:6:54,7 --> 0:6:55,49
have to leave New York.


138
0:6:55,49 --> 0:6:59,42
Because the chances of getting
cancer would increase 100%


139
0:6:59,42 --> 0:7:0,0
day-by-day.


140
0:7:0,0 --> 0:7:2,28
Obviously nobody wants to get
cancer, so they leave.


141
0:7:2,28 --> 0:7:5,6
You can't come back for another
30 or 40 years, and


142
0:7:5,6 --> 0:7:5,87
you can't clean it up.


143
0:7:5,87 --> 0:7:10,31
So New York ceases to exist,
it's done, which would kill


144
0:7:10,31 --> 0:7:11,525
America, right?


145
0:7:11,525 --> 0:7:14,4
JAKE BURGHART: So where's
the bomb?


146
0:7:14,4 --> 0:7:25,996



147
0:7:25,996 --> 0:7:27,79
SHANE SMITH: Well we said,
where's the bomb?


148
0:7:27,79 --> 0:7:31,3
And he said oh, I buried it in
my mother's garden in Varna.


149
0:7:31,3 --> 0:7:32,47
And we're like, well, hey,
we'll give you money.


150
0:7:32,47 --> 0:7:34,59
Let's go see the bomb.


151
0:7:34,59 --> 0:7:35,42
He was like no, no, we can't.


152
0:7:35,42 --> 0:7:38,54
We tried to find out, but the
bomb's still out there, which


153
0:7:38,54 --> 0:7:39,42
is kind of terrifying.


154
0:7:39,42 --> 0:7:41,5
Or there's other bombs.


155
0:7:41,5 --> 0:7:42,6
I mean, this was part
of the old Soviet


156
0:7:42,6 --> 0:7:44,12
arms dump from Sliven.


157
0:7:44,12 --> 0:7:45,44
There might be 10 other bombs.


158
0:7:45,44 --> 0:7:49,235
God knows who the hell
bought them.


159
0:7:49,235 --> 0:7:50,201
JAKE BURGHART: Wow.


160
0:7:50,201 --> 0:7:52,62
SHANE SMITH: Yeah.


161
0:7:52,62 --> 0:7:55,1
So if you can go buy one of
these things on the black


162
0:7:55,1 --> 0:7:56,56
market, that's it.


163
0:7:56,56 --> 0:7:57,895
JAKE BURGHART: Which you guys
just went and found.


164
0:7:57,895 --> 0:7:59,92
SHANE SMITH: Yeah, we found
the dude who sold it.


165
0:7:59,92 --> 0:8:2,13
Then that's it, that's
the end of time.


166
0:8:2,13 --> 0:8:5,24
Because it could be Osama bin
Laden, it could be some white


167
0:8:5,24 --> 0:8:8,15
supremacist dude from Arkansas,
it could be some guy


168
0:8:8,15 --> 0:8:11,74
who hates your football
team, whatever it is.


169
0:8:11,74 --> 0:8:13,28
I know, why don't
we know this?


170
0:8:13,28 --> 0:8:15,61
Why aren't we being told this?


171
0:8:15,61 --> 0:10:15,61
