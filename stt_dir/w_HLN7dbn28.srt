0:0:10,22 --> 0:0:11,22
SHANE SMITH: Hi, I'm
Shane Smith.


3
0:0:11,22 --> 0:0:13,59
And we're here in the Vice
offices in Brooklyn, New York.


4
0:0:13,59 --> 0:0:16,96
As a thank you for hitting 1
million subscribers on our


5
0:0:16,96 --> 0:0:19,62
Vice YouTube channel, we wanted
to take you in, show


6
0:0:19,62 --> 0:0:21,5
you around, on how we
hit that million.


7
0:0:21,5 --> 0:0:24,55
So come on, let's go inside.


8
0:0:24,55 --> 0:0:28,2
In here is editorial, where
people write all the stuff and


9
0:0:28,2 --> 0:0:30,38
come up with all the stories.


10
0:0:30,38 --> 0:0:33,22
This Alex Pasternack, who
runs Motherboard.


11
0:0:33,22 --> 0:0:35,56
What stories are
you working on?


12
0:0:35,56 --> 0:0:37,96
ALEX PASTERNACK: We're doing
something right now about 3D


13
0:0:37,96 --> 0:0:38,82
printed guns.


14
0:0:38,82 --> 0:0:39,94
SHANE SMITH: 3D printed guns?


15
0:0:39,94 --> 0:0:40,56
Do they work?


16
0:0:40,56 --> 0:0:41,8
Can you shoot them?


17
0:0:41,8 --> 0:0:43,4
[HIGH-PITCHED SHOTS]


18
0:0:43,4 --> 0:0:44,9
ALEX PASTERNACK: Yeah,
they sure do.


19
0:0:44,9 --> 0:0:46,37
SHANE SMITH: 3D printed
guns, it's the future.


20
0:0:46,37 --> 0:0:47,77
So this is all the writing,
editorial.


21
0:0:47,77 --> 0:0:49,31
And then we go through here.


22
0:0:49,31 --> 0:0:53,48
These are all edit suites, where
we edit all the stories.


23
0:0:53,48 --> 0:0:54,92
What are you working on?


24
0:0:54,92 --> 0:0:56,785
TRAVIS WOOD: Working on
a Fringes episode.


25
0:0:56,785 --> 0:0:58,19
It's called Gaddafi Wiki.


26
0:0:58,19 --> 0:1:0,74
SHANE SMITH: Fringes
is a series on?


27
0:1:0,74 --> 0:1:1,45
YouTube.


28
0:1:1,45 --> 0:1:4,489
Corruption, dictators, Muammar
Gaddafi, you're going to watch


29
0:1:4,489 --> 0:1:5,44
it on YouTube.


30
0:1:5,44 --> 0:1:7,7
Everybody editing.


31
0:1:7,7 --> 0:1:7,94
That looks interesting.


32
0:1:7,94 --> 0:1:9,33
I don't know what it is.


33
0:1:9,33 --> 0:1:10,82
Let's go upstairs.


34
0:1:10,82 --> 0:1:12,88
Hi, this is Matt Schoen.


35
0:1:12,88 --> 0:1:13,93
He's our art director.


36
0:1:13,93 --> 0:1:15,665
He makes us seem smart.


37
0:1:15,665 --> 0:1:16,95
So now we'll go in here.


38
0:1:16,95 --> 0:1:18,89
This is production.


39
0:1:18,89 --> 0:1:21,74
So this is where the stories,
like scopolamine, which is the


40
0:1:21,74 --> 0:1:25,26
"World's Scariest Drug", or the
world's freakiest drug,


41
0:1:25,26 --> 0:1:28,53
snake venom, or cannibals,
interview with a cannibal, or


42
0:1:28,53 --> 0:1:31,14
when I went to Liberia to hang
out with cannibal warlords,


43
0:1:31,14 --> 0:1:33,53
any of that stuff,
it happens here.


44
0:1:33,53 --> 0:1:35,86
These are the producers that
come up with the ideas and


45
0:1:35,86 --> 0:1:38,4
deal with the red tape
to get us in.


46
0:1:38,4 --> 0:1:41,53
And this year, we will be
working on stories coming out


47
0:1:41,53 --> 0:1:48,19
of Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq,
South America, West Africa.


48
0:1:48,19 --> 0:1:49,99
We have a lot of breaking
news stories, a lot


49
0:1:49,99 --> 0:1:53,155
of interesting stuff.


50
0:1:53,155 --> 0:1:55,88
We wanted to say, thank
you from Vice


51
0:1:55,88 --> 0:1:57,19
for the first million.


52
0:1:57,19 --> 0:2:0,98
On the second million, I'll
do the whole tour naked.


53
0:2:0,98 --> 0:2:2,98
Thank you very much,
1 million subs.


54
0:2:2,98 --> 0:2:5,92
Stay tuned, the best
is yet to come.


55
0:2:5,92 --> 0:2:7,17
Bang-o.


56
0:2:7,17 --> 0:4:7,17
