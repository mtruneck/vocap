0:0:6,2 --> 0:0:7,745
THOMAS MORTON: Hi, welcome
to the Vice offices.


3
0:0:7,745 --> 0:0:10,32
As you can see, everybody here
is doing a very good job


4
0:0:10,32 --> 0:0:11,64
looking busy.


5
0:0:11,64 --> 0:0:13,24
They're all at computers though,
which means what


6
0:0:13,24 --> 0:0:15,65
they're actually doing is
basically what you are doing--


7
0:0:15,65 --> 0:0:17,46
screwing around on
the internet.


8
0:0:17,46 --> 0:0:19,7
I work on a computer too.


9
0:0:19,7 --> 0:0:23,61
I'm no stranger to YouTube
links, and so I decided to put


10
0:0:23,61 --> 0:0:25,684
together a few of my favorites
from this week.


11
0:0:25,684 --> 0:0:30,765
So come enjoy the cream
of the crap.


12
0:0:30,765 --> 0:0:33,81
[SIGH]


13
0:0:33,81 --> 0:0:36,7
Since it's our first week
together, we are forging a


14
0:0:36,7 --> 0:0:39,56
little bond of intimacy with us,
I figured instead of doing


15
0:0:39,56 --> 0:0:41,23
the week's round up, I would
kind of dig back into the


16
0:0:41,23 --> 0:0:44,61
personal archives and share
with you five of my--


17
0:0:44,61 --> 0:0:48,7
maybe not all time favorite,
but I think significant


18
0:0:48,7 --> 0:0:51,646
YouTube clips from
my own life.


19
0:0:51,646 --> 0:0:55,39
Our first one is completely
self-contained and


20
0:0:55,39 --> 0:0:56,54
self-explanatory.


21
0:0:56,54 --> 0:1:0,966
It's an Asian reporter
going down a slide.


22
0:1:0,966 --> 0:1:8,24
REPORTER: [SPEAKING CHINESE]


23
0:1:8,24 --> 0:1:11,68
[SCREAMING]


24
0:1:11,68 --> 0:1:15,16
THOMAS MORTON: Look, I'm
not going to try to--


25
0:1:15,16 --> 0:1:16,99
kind of want to make that my
ringtone, to be frank.


26
0:1:16,99 --> 0:1:20,88
The next video is what qualifies
as a griefing video.


27
0:1:20,88 --> 0:1:24,14
It's labeled "An epic troll,"
which is kind of like


28
0:1:24,14 --> 0:1:25,83
"slander" and "libel"--
they're both more or


29
0:1:25,83 --> 0:1:27,34
less the same term.


30
0:1:27,34 --> 0:1:30,39
The audio is piped in, which
makes it even funnier.


31
0:1:30,39 --> 0:1:33,75
And then to emphasize that, and
make sure you understand


32
0:1:33,75 --> 0:1:36,77
exactly what swears they're
sputtering,


33
0:1:36,77 --> 0:1:38,2
they've added text.


34
0:1:38,2 --> 0:1:45,425



35
0:1:45,425 --> 0:1:50,56
THOMAS MORTON: As a veteran of
many busted NES controllers


36
0:1:50,56 --> 0:1:56,17
and harsh words to my mom in
other rooms, I think it's only


37
0:1:56,17 --> 0:1:56,98
par for the course.


38
0:1:56,98 --> 0:2:0,39
But it's kind of like a grunting
in tennis, it helps


39
0:2:0,39 --> 0:2:1,64
you play better.


40
0:2:1,64 --> 0:2:7,16



41
0:2:7,16 --> 0:2:10,539
So the deal with this kid
is, I think it's like a


42
0:2:10,539 --> 0:2:14,5
10-year-old who has a camera,
but probably also Autism.


43
0:2:14,5 --> 0:2:17,93
So this is just one video from
this kid who has a whole page


44
0:2:17,93 --> 0:2:20,59
that you should subscribe to
immediately, because all his


45
0:2:20,59 --> 0:2:22,67
videos are of--


46
0:2:22,67 --> 0:2:26,55
not at him, but of what he sees
through the camera, and


47
0:2:26,55 --> 0:2:29,25
then him talking about the
camera and then kind of


48
0:2:29,25 --> 0:2:32,9
getting angry about the
camera's occasional


49
0:2:32,9 --> 0:2:34,15
non-functionality.


50
0:2:34,15 --> 0:2:37,15



51
0:2:37,15 --> 0:2:38,19
CHILD (OFFSCREEN): Dang it.


52
0:2:38,19 --> 0:2:39,725
Can't zoom up on this camera.


53
0:2:39,725 --> 0:2:42,24



54
0:2:42,24 --> 0:2:44,52
Wonder if all these people
have ever heard of


55
0:2:44,52 --> 0:2:45,79
the camera I have?


56
0:2:45,79 --> 0:2:48,37



57
0:2:48,37 --> 0:2:51,24
THOMAS MORTON: This is as a
little more cerebral fare.


58
0:2:51,24 --> 0:2:58,16
It's a robotic birth simulator
as being demonstrated by a guy


59
0:2:58,16 --> 0:3:5,7
who has clearly been inside a
countless number of vagina's.


60
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:9,57
He makes Wilt Chamberlain look
like Tiny Tim, basically.


61
0:3:9,57 --> 0:3:12,18
MALE SPEAKER: Often junior
doctors can place the first


62
0:3:12,18 --> 0:3:15,55
blade, but have a lot of
difficulties to place the


63
0:3:15,55 --> 0:3:16,36
second blade.


64
0:3:16,36 --> 0:3:18,3
THOMAS MORTON: I cannot believe
this hasn't been taken


65
0:3:18,3 --> 0:3:20,97
down and moved to RedTube yet.


66
0:3:20,97 --> 0:3:22,92
MALE SPEAKER: And the junior
doctor has to go through the


67
0:3:22,92 --> 0:3:25,35
spheres in order to
place the forceps.


68
0:3:25,35 --> 0:3:28,54



69
0:3:28,54 --> 0:3:31,85
THOMAS MORTON: This last clip
was a favorite of our British


70
0:3:31,85 --> 0:3:35,16
office for a while, I think
because all British people are


71
0:3:35,16 --> 0:3:38,61
racist against every other
country in Europe.


72
0:3:38,61 --> 0:3:40,29
It's a pool girl at--


73
0:3:40,29 --> 0:3:44,9
as evidenced by the bathing
suits-- an Eastern European


74
0:3:44,9 --> 0:3:48,22
party of some sort, in the
mother of all k-holes.

hope you enjoyed this.
