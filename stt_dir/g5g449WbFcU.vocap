###8 Okay. Briefly. Jacque is an industrial designer but mostly a social engineer. He lived through
###12 the great depression in 1929 and came out of it thinking that there was still goods
###18 in store windows, things in ca..cars in car lots but people just didn't have the money
###23 to buy things. So he realized it was the rules of the game that we play by that were so screwed
###30 up... and from when he was very young, he set out to find an alternative social design
###36 to take care of the problems that we have today. This is what's very different between
###40 Jacque and other protestors and people who..who understand that the system is not working
###47 but they do not pose an alternative. I don't know of anyone else who tries to find the
###53 root causes of the problems and understands that things cannot be fixed within the monetary
###59 system and the system that we live by today. So, Jacque has worked.. He's 95 years old.
###67 He's worked since he was very young to..working with people: drug addicts, alcoholics.. changing
###73 them, joining the Klu Klux Klan and changing them. Putting his educational processes to
###79 test.. and understanding if he needs to change the world, he needs to be able to change peoples
###85 values as well. So, he's arrived at a totally new social design and he backs it up technically!
###92 These are not just words that he's talk about. If you go to our website: "THEVENUSPROJECT.COM"
###95 You'll see what this..this new world civilization, this sustainable future would look like. Jacque
###102 Fresco: So I see, eventually, whether The Venus Project gets off the ground or not,
###111 this is what I see: I see machines displacing people... and if you displace people in the
###118 automotive industry, where the machine picks up the car, puts the wheels on.. you're displacing
###124 millions of people. You don't need air conditioning. You don't need to pay em' for vacations. You
###130 don't need to take out insurance on their health.. and you don't need all the lights
###135 you need with people working there. So, industry will put in machines, wherever they can..
###141 but here's the downfall: If you keep doing that all over the country, people will not
###147 have the money to buy vacuum cleaners, electric fans, or refrigerators. If you displace most
###153 people by machines, "How are they gonna buy things?" So, it's a self-contradictory system...
###161 and THIS is the basis of understanding: That politics was good 100 years ago but it's obsolete
###169 today. Everything that you have in your own, those of you that have a home... Your television
###176 set, your washing machine, your refrigerator, your electric lights are all technical! There's
###182 nothing political about that. It's all technical. If you took away the technology today, you'd
###189 have people pulling boats along the river. Do you understand that? It's technology that
###197 frees you from things. It's electric air-conditioning that makes your house tolerable. So, we don't
###202 want to put the technicians in control anymore than they're in control today. All the technicians
###209 do is build bridges if you're a bridge designer. If you're an air plane designer, you can work
###212 on air plane designing but you don't tell people what to do. It isn't that technicians
###220 will rule the world. I'm against that! I'm against scientist ruling the world! I don't
###225 see any real scientist protesting against the exploitation of young kids when they work
###233 in factories. We use to hire children that were 12 years old and put them in factories
###238 and work em' saturday and sunday. It's when people march to free those kids from those
###244 conditions. "Why do women have to fight for women rights?" "Why did women have to march
###249 years ago for a public library?" I don't know why JUST women did but they did march and
###255 they wanted a public library so if people couldn't afford books, they could have access
###261 to books. Then there's the metaphysician who really believes that everybody has goodness
###267 within themselves. They really don't have anything within themselves. If you were brought
###274 up in Nazi Germany as a baby, after Hitler burned most the books, you'd be a Nazi. If
###280 you're brought up in Australia, you'd say, "How are ya' mate?!" That would be normal
###284 to the way you speak. If you're brought up in Germany, "Deutschland Å¸ber alles!"..Germany
###290 above all. If you're brought up that way. So you musn't hate anybody because their all
###296 brought up. "What are American soldiers?" They are killing machines. They're not taught
###302 anything..anything else. If I had anything to do with it, I would take ALL the soldiers,
###307 send em' back to the university to become problem solvers. We have allot of problems
###314 that aren't solved... and that's what we need. Problem solvers! For every Edison we found,
###320 imagine all the Edison's we never found. I don't say Edison was good either. He was a
###330 crook also. Crowd Question: "Don't scientist usually rely on statistics to make a decision?
###332 It seems, uh, usually, its, you know, statistical analysis and then they draw a conclusion from
###337 that and then, you know, as science evolves and as we make new sciences, we will again
###339 have like better kinds of statistics or whatever and then we'll apply those to the new technology
###341 that we develop. So how do we develop a language that's not subject to interpretation.. or
###351 statistical interpretation?!" Jacque Fresco: "Scientist today are commercially rewarded
###356 for being chemist or working for the drug companies or working for the aircraft companies.
###360 They're just as corrupt as anyone else... and scientist, if they were scientist, they'd
###365 say, "What makes war? Why are we going to war with Germany? What's the problem? What
###369 makes a man the way they are?" They wouldn't stay in their field. Today their chemist.
###376 They're scientific in chemistry. Then there's structural engineers that are scientific in
###380 structures... but they're not scientific in human relation. They know nothing about it
###385 or little about human behavior. So, I'm saying there's no such thing as a scientist, YET!
###389 Otherwise, they'd be out here in the protest. Do you understand? I'm not talking about a
###401 world managed by scientist... but a world managed by scientific method! That means first
###407 you do a survey of Texas, "How much air able land do you have?" "How much water do you
###415 have underground?" After you do that survey, you can estimate how big a city can be built
###420 in that region. If it doesn't have the resources, it won't work. If you have a population far
###428 above 7 billion, there will not be enough food to go around and there's gonna be territorial
###434 disputes. Territorial disputes are not made by bad people or fascists or communists or
###441 socialists free enterprises. They're made by social conditions called, "The March of
###447 Events". In other words, if a meteor were coming toward the Earth, I can assure you
###453 that all nations would stop their armies and navies and share ideas with one another to
###458 try to divert that meteor away from the Earth. Not because they're good but because they're
###463 all threatened. All nations will join together on any common threat if they realize it. Crowd
###470 Question: "I'm a mother of 7 children. Which of my 5 children should not be here so that
###476 way it would reduce the population of the Earth?!" Jacque Fresco: "Well, all i can say,
###480 if you want a world without war, without hunger, without poverty, it has to be in accordance
###487 with the carrying capacity of the Earth's resources. If you go beyond that, you're going
###493 to have trouble. Do you understand what I'm saying? Crowd Question: "It seems to me what
###497 you're saying is, that you want fewer people but who are you to designate who the people
###501 that should and should not be here?!" Roxanne: No, he's not saying that at all. Crowd Question:
###506 "I'm asking for clarification!" Roxanne: You'd have to listen to know more about the system.
###512 What he's proposing is a system based on the methods of science to..to produce abundance
###521 for everyone in the quickest time..without polluting the earth. He's talking about a
###524 system based on..on the well-being of people AND the environment. He's talking about a
###531 system that does not use money. As long as you use money, you'll have corruption, greed,
###537 crime, embezzlement. So he's trying to get rid of the root causes of the problem. We
###544 have enough have goods and resources to take care of the entire population and even more
###550 if we use it wisely... but what we're doing today, we're doing mass killings by starvation...
###556 and we're against that. We're saying we have enough resources if we use science and technology
###562 to the best of our ability without the monetary system to feed, house, and clothe everyone
###570 on earth. We can do that today. That's what he's talking about. Jacque: "I'm not against
###581 you. Sometimes a person comes up to me and he says, "I have 10 children." and then I
###589 say, "What are they for?" "What are they for?" Just having children is not wisdom! No, I
###597 don't believe in depopulation, I believe in educating the public. "Why don't you put 10,000
###604 people on the boat?" Cause it'll sink! The displacement of the boat determines how many
###609 people you can put on it, not Fresco... and if you wanna take a..take 400 people and put
###615 em' in a spaceship, it won't get off the ground. You have to figure what the thrust is. How
###620 much thrust you can develop in a spaceship... and when the government came up to scientist
###627 and said, "Can you put a man on the Moon?", the first thing they said was, "I don't know."
###632 So i'm saying there is other ways of thinking about things but you need help. When a man
###635 takes his belt off and whips his kids, "Is he bad?" No! He doesn't know any other way
###642 to get to them. He says, "Do what your Daddy says!" The kid doesn't so he whips him because
###650 his Daddy whipped him. He doesn't know! Now protesting the stock exchange will not change
###654 anything! I hate to tell you this. I wish it did. I'm gonna try to tell you what we
###661 have to do. To live in a world without war, without poverty, without hunger and without
###668 most crimes... all criminals are made by this society, by the monetary system and scarcity
###675 and burdens that are too big for the average person to handle. There will be no armies,
###685 no navies, no prisons, and no police in a Resource-Based Economy. Whyyy? Because it's
###696 just like the public library. You can access any book you want to. Next door to the public
###702 library, we have a camera center, where anybody in the community, a 7-year old kid can walk
###710 in and say, "I've come to check-out a camera." Free! No fee involved. Do you understand that?
###717 Just like the public library. Next door to that you'd have musical instruments, where
###721 anybody, like the public library, can check out any musical instruments. The Venus Project
###727 is sharing all the world's resources with all the world's people. A Resource-Based Economy
###734 is using resources rather than money. Making all things available to all people... and
###743 if you don't do that, you'll have wars, robbery, crimes of all kinds. Even every criminal is
###750 made by this culture. Once you make things available, that's the end of crime. Do you
###758 understand that? Not say, "Don't steal!" As long as you understand that people are made
###768 that way. When you're brought up in Australia, you say, "I'm Australian and i'm proud of
###771 it." "I'm a Greek and i'm proud of it." That divides people. If you divide people, you
###778 can conquer them. So what the politicians say is things the public likes to hear. Scientists,
###785 not all them, some of them. When they discovered that the Earth is round, they don't say to
###790 the public, "It's a little round and a little flat." So they get along with everybody. No.
###797 They say, "You're wrong. It's not flat. Here's the evidence we have to show that it's round."....
###801 and what you have to do is change people. Roxanne: "We built everything ourselves. Put
###810 in all the windows. Instill the doors. We Built over 400 models of the future. We didn't
###816 have any outside capital to do that. I did..had a full-time job in order to support that.
###823 I put all the money towards that. We've put all the money that we've made in The Venus
###827 Project towards that as well. If anybody knows us, we work 7 days a week on...on promoting
###832 this direction. So we do have a non-profit organization now. We are collecting donations
###841 for a major motion picture that we want to do to show what a re..what life in a Resource-Based
###847 Economy would be like. And we live in a monetary system. Because we are working towards a Resource-Based
###854 Economy the coun..county does not say, "You're doing a great job. You don't have to pay taxes.
###860 You don't have to pay your electric bill. So.." Crowd Comment: "THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING
###861 THAT!"
