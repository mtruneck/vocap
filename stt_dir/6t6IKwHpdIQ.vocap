###7 Apocalypse The Second World War
###16 Aggression (1933--1939)
###40 Berlin - 1945
###44 Europe has been freed from The Nazis' reign of terror.
###48 The Red Army is waging its final battles.
###65 Captain Joseph Prautof, A Russian officer:
###68 <i> the hate ran so deep...</ i>
###71 <i> we wanted to end the war, and nighly that force that wanted to kill us...</ i>
###75 <i> finish it off, once and for all. </ i>
###83 Hitler's days are numbered.
###85 He leaves his bunker for one final bit of showmanship,
###88 as seen in this propaganda film.
###91 Is there still a soldier, or a child, willing to die for him?
###115 The war left some 50 million dead.
###118 most of them innocent civilians.
###121 For the women of Germany, the ordeal would continue
###124 even after the cannons have gone silent.
###128 The book "A Woman in Berlin" is a deeply disturbing account
###131 of the Russians rape of German women in 1945.
###143 <i> They grab me and throw me down. </ i>
###146 <i> I'm lying with my head on the steps. </ i>
###148 <i> I see one of the soldiers keeping watch, while the other rips off my under clothes. </ i>
###153 <i> and brutally forces himself on me. </ i>
###162 <i> But then we'd say, better to have a Russian on your belly, </ i>
###165 <i> then an American over your head. </ i>
###169 This German woman was referring to the Allied bombers, that pounded her city into ruins.
###182 The Kurfurstendam, Berlin's most fashionable avenue.
###186 13 years earlier, the showcase of Germany.
###190 A nation still plagued by crisis.
###193 A monument commemorating the millions of victims
###196 of the First World War.
###207 Marlene Dietrich is singing "The Blue Angel" in Berlin - Alexanderplatz.
###213 Thomas Mann is savoring his Noble Prize for Literature.
###216 in the shade of the linden trees, of Avenue Unter den Linden.
###221 Berlin is major cultural center of Europe,
###224 one of the most open and tolerant cities in the world.
###239 Then in 1933, all that changes.
###243 Through intimidation, demagoguery, and exploiting the bitterness of the German veterans.
###248 Hitler and his armed malicious, like the SA with their hymn, the "Horst Wessel Lied",
###254 seized control of Germany.
###266 The Nazis take advantage of the fact that the German Left is splinted.
###271 And it even seems like Hitler with his raised fist,
###274 revolutionary salute, wants to get on *****
###280 German Communists take their orders from Moscow,
###283 which view the social democrats as the true enemy.
###287 No alliance is possible between them.
###290 So for the last time, German Communists sing "De Internazionale".
###302 Hitler comes to power legally on January 30th, 1933.
###307 Within a few months, his dictatorship is firmly in place.
###312 He becomes The "Fuhrer" - The Leader.
###316 His supporters rise and chant: "Heil Hitler!"
###323 However, not all Germans are totally convinced, so again and again,
###327 Hitler hammers home his simplistic, nationalist slogans:
###333 <i> Before us lies Germany </ i>
###336 <i> Within us Germany is stirring </ i>
###338 <i> Behind us, All Germany is following </ i>
###344 And he eventually wins more and more people over,
###347 for he has a remarkable power of persuasion over the masses.
###352 But what does Hitler want?
###356 In his book "Mein Kampf" - My Struggle, He clearly states what he calls his mission.
###362 Being one of the imbedded veteran of the First World War, his mission will be to destroy France,
###368 to wipe out the humiliation of the Versaille Treaty of 1919
###372 that strips Germany of its army, and part of its territory.
###385 Then, he wants to conquer what he calls "Lebensraum" - living space.
###390 Germany has a population of 80 million, twice that of France.
###395 He wants to make Germany "The World Power" that it deserves to be.
###404 A pathological anti-semit,
###407 Hitler has also taken on the mission of asserting the superiority of the Germanic Arian race.
###412 menaced by the Jews.
###416 For him, the Jews were the cause of the Great War,
###421 German's defeat, inflation, unemployment.
###424 The next war will be a war on the Jews.
###430 They will be sent to Dachau, the first concentration camp.
###434 Where Hitler locks up the anti-Nazis, the communist, social-democrats, 75 00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:43,851 and all those opposed to the Nazi regime.
###445 Last lead, Hitler takes on the mission of bringing all German speaking people
###449 into the rights fold, beginning with those of his homeland.
###454 The Anschluss: Austria's annex,
###457 and immediately submitted to the same reign of terror as Germany.
###461 With the opening of one of the infamous concentration camps
###464 at Mauthausen, near Linz.
###468 Which country will be his next victim?
###471 Neighboring Czechoslovakia, whether is a German population,
###475 the Sudeten German.
###476 But the country is recognized as an independent state, by England and France.
###482 The clouds of war gather.
###486 In Munich, temple of Nazism, an 11-hour peace conference is organized.
###491 On one side, Adolf Hitler who was becoming more and more frightening.
###495 And his ally, the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini.
###501 Mussolini, the founder of fascism, an indoctrination of an entire nation.
###507 From child to a Don,
###519 On the other side, the Western democracies,
###522 victorious but exhausted from the Great War.
###526 Neville Chamberlain, the conservative British Prime Minister.
###529 And the radical socialist French Premier, Edouard Daladier,
###533 want to save the peace.
###541 They end up accepting the unacceptable,
###544 They give up the Czech province of Sudetenland to Hitler,
###547 In exchange for his solemn promise to make no more claim
###551 on another European territory.
###557 But what is Hitler's promise worth?
###561 Just 6 months later, he invades the rest of Czechoslovakia,
###565 and enters Prague, accompanied by Marshall Hermann Goering.
###571 Goering, a former First World War fighter pilot,
###574 one of the founders of the Nazi party, is now the Air Minister.
###577 And an ogre, trying to charm the Czech children.
###582 Hitler no longer needs the excuse of reuniting German speaking people.
###588 The powerful Czech industry will be working for him.
###591 Why shouldn't he take advantage of it?
###594 The Allies let him get away with it.
###600 The U.S.S.R. is the last major neighboring power left to counter Hitler
###606 It assigned a mutual assistance treaty with France.
###610 The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, is the official name
###614 of communist Russia, and its satellite republics.
###618 Manipulation of the masses in Red Square, masked the ironfisted dictatorship of Stalin
###624 who’s also thrown million of poor wretches into his labor camps,
###628 The Gulag
###636 Industrialization and forced militarization, have made the U.S.S.R. a major power.
###642 Despite their fear of communism, the Western powers rely on the U.S.S.R.
###654 Hitler is going to beat them to the punch.
###658 In the summer of 1939, in his Berchtesgarden chalet,
###662 with his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Joachim von Ribbentrop,
###665 he prepares a blocking maneuver.
###671 Hitler, who swore to destroy communism, sends von Robbentrop, the Nazi, to Moscow
###675 to sign a history-making treaty with his worst enemy.
###684 When Stalin's foreign affair minister, Molotov, signed the Germano-Soviet Pact,
###690 communists are totally taken aback, like these French Party Members.
###696 It's August, 1939, and people in France are enjoying their first paid holidays.
###701 One of the major victories of the Socialist Popular Front.
###706 One of the reasons behind this non-aggression pact.
###710 The Soviets answer that Stalin is playing for time.
###713 Letting Hitler and the Western powers killed each other off.
###718 Perhaps, Stalin, who intends to grab the Baltic countries and part of Poland
###722 even has the illusion that he could share Europe with Hitler on a permanent basis.
###730 In 1936, the US Congress had passed the Neutrality Act,
###734 to avoid being dragged into European war once again.
###740 So, with nothing to fear either from the United States or from Russia,
###744 Hitler decides to wipe out what he calls
###747 "the worst monstrosity of The Versaille Treaty"
###750 The Danzig Corridor.
###756 In 1919, German territory was cut in two,
###759 in order to give Poland access to the sea.
###762 Hitler decides to launch his invasion off Poland and recover Danzig.
###767 On September 1, 1939,
###770 At 5:35 AM.
###779 The first cannon shot of the Second World War, is fired on Danzig.
###801 Hitler is convinced that the French and the British will not take action.
###806 He had the two governments meet immediately, and sent him an ultimatum
###809 demanding that he hold all military action against Poland.
###817 Hitler declares, "Our enemies are little worms,"
###821 and he adds, "Who wants to get bogged down in a world war for Danzig? "
###827 September 3, 1939.
###829 At 11 AM, The Ambassador of Great Britain in Berlin delivers a declaration of war.
###836 At 5 PM, France declares war on Germany.
###841 Hitler can hardly believe it.
###844 German generals find themselves facing their worst case scenario:
###848 war, on two fronts.
###851 But the die is cast.
###853 Hitler unleashes the Wehrmacht, The Armed Forces of Nazi Germany,
###858 onto Poland.
###869 Entering battle as if in a bygone age, the Polish cavalry charges the German tanks,
###875 and is slaughtered.
###893 Paris, the Gare de l'Est train station,
###896 Many of these men had shipped out from these same platforms 25 years ago,
###901 in a totally different atmosphere.
###904 In August 1914, they marched off to war in high spirit
###908 with flowers in their riffles.
###911 But there are no flowers this time.
###913 And no riffles.
###922 Nobody wants to fight this war.
###927 4 million men are mobilized.
###931 Many of them are farmers. France is still a largely rural country.
###936 They head for the German border on foot, with their officers following on horseback.
###943 Army's still rely heavily on horses. And these are requisition surround the country.
###952 Motorization is not kept up.
###955 Gaston Chirac, a driver of one of these outdated trucks,
###959 with solid rubber tires, recalls:
###963 <i> There was such a shortage of equipment. we have one riffle for two per truck </ I>
###968 <i> We have one box of 10 bullets, which we won't allow to open. </ i>
###973 <i> It was pathetic. </ i>
###975 <i> If we had what we needed, we'd have fought, </ i>
###978 <i> cause we're no a great friend of the "Bosche". </ i>
###986 The "Bosche" was a pejorative term for the German soldiers during the previous war.
###991 They were also called "vert-de-gris", which in French means "field gray",
###996 the color of their uniform, which enable them to blend in with their surroundings.
###1004 But just who are these soldiers?
###1007 Let’s take for an example, one of these young German, marching as he sings:
###1012 <i> "Our lag is waving before us, Our flag is a new age." </ i>
###1017 <i> "Our flag is stronger than death." </ i>
###1025 His name is August von Kageneck, he writes:
###1028 <i> I thought that the military career was the right choice. My parents thought so as well. </ i>
###1034 <i> My father would tell me: "At least there, you can still open your mouth and say what you like,  </ i>
###1039 <i> and you don't have to do that Nazi salute. "</ i>
###1043 In September 1939, August von Kageneck is still training to become a tank commander.
###1050 He writes:
###1051 <i> My father who is a general was telling me: </ i>
###1053 <i> The French have 40 divisions on the border, we have 15. </ i>
###1058 <i> All the rest of them are in  Poland. 500,000 men against 200,000.  </ I>
###1064 <i> They outnumber us, 2 to 1. </ i>
###1071 French Forces attack on September 7, 1939,
###1075 4 days after declaring war.
###1079 This offensive notched to show public opinion that Poland is not being abandoned,
###1083 advances 8 km into the Saar region.
###1092 The French army's cinema department shows off the spoils of war.
###1097 Bicycles..
###1101 
###1128 The Saar offensive stops there, and degenerates into a series of skirmishes,
###1115 raids by lead commandos, led by the hero, Joseph Darnand,
###1119 who receives the citation of "Premier Soldier of France".
###1130 Later, he will become one of the most rabid collaborators with the German.
###1135 And eventually, he'll be executed after the war.
###1141 The French army, in spite of its hero and its superiority in numbers, takes no further action,
###1148 General Maurice Gamelin 67 years old,
###1152 is Commandeer-in-Chief of the Allied-Franco British Land Forces.
###1156 For the French outnumber the British,
###1158 who also thinks that this war isn't for real, and it'll all be settled  soon.
###1172 Gamelin himself has no desire to re-fight the war of 1914.
###1177 He wants to avoid another blood bath, at any cost.
###1182 He considers that he needs 2 years save behind the Maginot Line,
###1186 in order to re-arm the country.
###1190 The Maginot line is the work of a former Minister of war, Andre Maginot.
###1195 This complex of fortification was meant to stop the German enemy, once and for all.
###1201 It took nearly 10 years to construct,
###1203 and swallowed up 1,5 million cubic meters of concrete,
###1207 and 150,000 tons of steel.
###1211 All these ***** are linked together by a labyrinth of tunnels, 100 km of them.
###1217 The line itself, stretch for 720 km,
###1221 from the Swiss to the Belgian borders.
###1225 The Maginot Lines ends on the foot of the Ardennes Forrest.
###1228 The French military command thought that German tanks could never cross these extremely
###1233 rough terrain.
###1235 The French didn't extend the line all the way to the sea,
###1238 because Belgium before declaring its neutrality
###1240 was an ally of France, and opposed it.
###1244 This northern part of the France is man by a French army and the British Expeditionary Forces.
###1249 Later reinforced by Canadians, and troops from the far flunk British Empire.
###1267 In Britain a popular song of the day was "The Washing on the Siegfried Line"
###1273 <i> We're going to hang out the washing on the Siegfried Line. </ i>
###1277 <i> Have you any dirty washing, mother dear? </ i>
###1281 <i> We're gonna hang out the washing on the Siegfried Line. </ i>
###1285 <i> 'Cause the washing day is here. </ i>
###1292 The Siegfried line is the string of fortifications constructed by Hitler,
###1296 facing the Maginot Line.
###1299 The Germans don't attack, they're still trying to avoid a second front.
###1306 The French, nevertheless, takes some precaution.
###1309 They evacuated the population of Alsace and  Lorraine
###1313 to the region of Perigord and Charentes in the south west.
###1321 Strasbourg, a ghost town,
###1326 abandoned by its population,
###1329 emptied off its soul
###1331 especially that of the synagogues.
###1347 
###1367 On September 20, Hitler orders the bombing of Warsaw.
###1355 The city is surrounded, but still holding out.
###1382 The Fuhrer wants to strike terror into the hearts and mind not only of the Polish  .
###1386 but also the French's and British' as well.
###1390 "This is what is in the store for you."
###1399 The world is horrified.
###1401 In New York, the bombing of Warsaw is up in lights in Time Square,
###1405 and on the front page of all the newspapers.
###1411 Franklin D. Roosevelt, The President of The United States addresses the nation:
###1416 <i> This nation will remain a neutral nation, </ i>
###1420 <i> But I cannot ask that every American remain neutral in thought as well. </ i>
###1427 <i> Even a neutral has a right to take account of facts. </ i>
###1433 <i> Even a neutral cannot be asked to close his mind, </ i>
###1438 <i> or to close his conscious. </ i>
###1442 The bombing of Warsaw shows how vulnerable the cities are.
###1446 Paris sets about protecting its monuments.
###1449 and hides its museum masterpieces out in the provinces.
###1455 The Champ de Mars, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, is dug full of bomb shelters,
###1460 and there are frequent air raid drills.
###1472 Gas masks are compulsory.
###1505 Poison gases were used in the First World War, and now, everyone is afraid of them.
###1512 Even the horses.
###1521 Meanwhile, Poland, is being ruthlessly carved up.
###1546 As previously agreed with Hitler, the Soviet have invaded the eastern half of Poland.
###1552 Here, German and Soviet soldiers are fraternizing,
###1556 and in congruent side, to say the least.
###1559 The Nazis hand out flyers that read:
###1561 <i> The German Army salutes the Red Army of workers and farmers </ i>
###1565 <i> which is always held in the highest respect. </ i>
###1572 The Polish Army surrenders to the German, and in the east, to the Soviet.
###1582 Stalin then orders the execution of 20,000 Polish prisoners.
###1595 He wants to eliminated their leads of this country he intends to annex.
###1600 4,500 Polish officers are executed with a bullet in their head,
###1605 in the Katyn forest, near Smolensk, in Russia.
###1612 2 years later, at the Kremlin, Stalin meets with the head of the Polish Government in exile,
###1616 General Sikorski, who delivers a list of Polish missing officers.
###1627 The Soviets deny any wrong-doing.
###1640 In 1992, the president of post-Soviet Russia, Boris Yeltsin
###1644 will present the Polish president, Lech Walesa, with the original order of execution,
###1650 signed by Stalin himself.
###1658 Stalin, by occupying half of Poland,
###1661 is in fact, playing into the hands of Hitler, who needs a common border
###1665 with U.S.S.R. to facilitate his plan, to invade Russia.
###1672 Hitler and Himmler, the head of the SS, will now take care of Poland
###1677 by naming the Nazi, Hans Frank, Governor General of the Occupied Polish Provinces
###1683 who proclaims:
###1684 <i> I have the power of life and death over the Polish people. </ i>
###1693 After the war, he will be tried in Nurenberg
###1696 and hanged for crime against humanity.
###1708 These gypsies, held in a pen, are filmed by a German.
###1713 For the Nazis, they are 'non-persons'.
###1717 The women will be forced to undergo sterilization,
###1719 because they "do not deserve to reproduce".
###1726 The Nazis declare 'open season' on gypsies.
###1730 Hundreds of thousands will be interned in concentration camps,
###1743 The ordeal of the Jewish people, begin.
###1749 The Nazis now have 3 millions of Polish Jews at their mercy.
###1761 Hitler is still uncertain about what to do with them.
###1765 As long as the war is going well for him, he considers deporting them to the east.
###1769 or even shipping them to Madagascar.
###1775 It's only when the outcome of the wars becomes less certain
###1778 that Hitler and his accomplices unleashed a frenzy of hate and murder.
###1783 "The Final Solution".
###1790 For the time being, the Jews had to be identified,
###1793 marked with the yellow star, and herded into ghettos.
###1797 Some of which, are completely walled-off.
###1805 From the diary of one of these unfortunate souls:
###1809 <i> It's heart-rending to see the shameful scenes of violence that take place </ i>
###1813 <i> before our eyes. </ i>
###1815 <i> Women and the elderly, beaten right out in the street by petty thugs. </ i>
###1820 <i> Tears come to my eyes. </ i>
###1823 <i> All our powerlessness,  </ i>
###1826 <i> all our isolation is there to see right in the open where not a single person takes on offence. </ i>
###1831 <i> We are so weak. </ i>
###1838 All the major cities of Poland will have their ghetto prisons
###1841 where German, Austrian, and Czech Jews will also be interned.
###1850 The Jews here still feel confidence that, perhaps someday, they'll be able to return to their home.
###1856 They don't know that they will die of hunger and cold.
###1861 They don't know that the show is about to begin.
###1867 <i> Inhabited by Jew. No Entrance. </ i>
###1877 Warsaw, is in ruins.
###1880 Hitler comes to be filmed by a propaganda crew,
###1883 seen here traveling in a car in the background.
###1895 These victorious German soldiers march their goose step to the sound of the grenadiers' march.
###1901 But they weren't too efficient during the Polish campaign.
###1905 Poor preparation, a lack of fighting spirit, and even cases of indiscipline
###1910 are the points that the commander-in-chief, General von Brauchitsch,
###1914 dares report to the Fuhrer.
###1924 Hitler is furious, but he is immune to doubt and orders the attack to the West to be prepared.
###1930 An attack on the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.
###1935 Some of his generals think its madness,
###1938 some of them begin plotting to overthrow the Fuhrer.
###1942 This is a crucial moment, the course of history lies in the balance.
###1949 November 8, 1939. Hitler narrowly escaped an assassination attempt.
###1955 It's seems that he enjoys some kind of divine protection.
###1959 When he attempts the funeral for the victims, he's no longer the same man.
###1964 His power over the army and the German people has grown even stronger.
###1971 He told to the generals:
###1973 <i> My decision is irrevocable. I will attack France when the time is right.</ i>
###1977 <i> I will be victorious, or die in the attempt. </ i>
###1982 Yet, Hitler is still uncertain about attacking the West, for he also says:
###1987 <i> War is like opening the door on a dark room. </ i>
###1991 <i> You'll never know what will happen. </ i>
###1998 Eventually, he postpones the order on the attack, and goes back to his chalet in the Alps
###2002 to join his mistress, Eva Braun.
###2011 She shot this footage of Hitler entourage
###2014 of the Reich's architect, Albert Speer, who goes for a long walk with Hitler.
###2020 Speer recalls:
###2022 <i> Hitler wanted to re-christened Berlin, Germania. </ I>
###2026 <i> We already had a mark up of the future, Adolf Hitler Square </ i>
###2029 <i> with a dome, inspired by St. Peter's in Rome, </ i>
###2033 <i> but 17 times bigger. </ i>
###2036 <i> I said to him, "My Fuhrer, wouldn't that make an ideal target for bombers? </ i>
###2041 <i> He answered: Not at all. Goering has assured me that </ i>
###2044 <i> no enemy aircraft will ever fly over the Reich. </ i>
###2052 From his barrack, the future German officer, August von Kageneck, writes to his mother:
###2058 <i> We are all eager to fight. We are ready for battle.</ I>
###2062 His mother answers:
###2063 <i> This war is a crime, and we are going to have to pay for it. </ i>
###2074 The war then enters a new bizarre face,
###2077 The Germans call it the "Sitzkrieg", "the sitting war".
###2084 The British call it the "phoney war",
###2090 and for the French, it's "Drole de Guerre", "the funny war".
###2100 A long, strange waiting period, especially hard on the women.
###2105 For them there's not only the anguish of war, but also the survival of their family to worry about.
###2124 As in the last war, the soldiers dig in and try to make the best of things.
###2132 The French soldier, Gaston Chirac, writes to his wife:
###2134 <i> It's 30 degrees below zero, the bread is frozen. </ I>
###2139 <i> I'm one of the lucky ones. They gave us some straw, and with that, we can sleep better. </ i>
###2205 The winter of 1939-1940 is indeed one of the coldest of the century .
###2210 To make a bad situation worst, all the winters of this war, will be brutally cold.
###2250 The commander-in-chief, General Gamelin, is expecting the Germans to attack through Belgium
###2256 and move towards Paris across this open plain, like in 1914.
###2261 Gamelin plans to make his stand against the German, on Belgium soil.
###2268 In France, Colonel de Gaulle, a tank officer, who is beginning to make a name for himself
###2273 criticizes this strategy.
###2276 He calls it the "Maginot Lines Mentality"
###2279 which consist in waiting for the other side to make a move.
###2284 It is booked towards the professional army.
###2286 He argues in favor of taking the offensive, making massive use of tanks.
###2292 France is producing 300 tanks a month,
###2295 but they're being disperse in all the sections to back up the infantry.
###2308 French aviation has also fallen behind.
###2312 France ordered 4,000 planes from the United States.
###2316 Inspired the ever growing isolationist trend championed by Charles Lindbergh,
###2320 the hero who made the first Trans Atlantic solo flight
###2323 and now a leading proponent of the "America First" movement.
###2329 <i> If you believe in an independent destiny for America, </ i>
###2334 <i> if you believe that this country should not enter the war in Europe, </ i>
###2339 <i> we ask you to join the America First Committee in its stand. </ i>
###2344 It's the isolationists' voice of America
###2347 and, of public personalities like Henry Ford, the anti-Semitic car maker,
###2355 or like Joseph Kennedy, America's ambassador in London, who is anti war.
###2361 Whereas his son, John 'the future president' Kennedy, supports European democracies.
###2370 Nazi sympathizers in America also contribute to the impassion climate
###2375 that reigns at the beginning of 1940.
###2380 In Europe, The British Union of Fascist are also quite active
###2383 up to the moment they're banned.
###2386 Oswald Mosley, "The English Fuhrer", challenges the government, right in the center of London.
###2392 He'll spend the next several years in prison.
###2406 Mosley's speeches urge people to get out on the streets, and stop the war.
###2414 But Winston Churchill has taken the reins of the British government.
###2418 Here, we see him with French general Gamelin, and Admiral Darlan
###2422 who are on an unofficial visit to London.
###2429 A Franco-British Expedition Recon, is formed to help Finland
###2433 which is being invaded by the Soviet Union.
###2440 France is preparing to send its elite soldiers, The French Foreign Legion.
###2447 For a century it has been taking in the world's reprobates, no matter what their past.
###2453 As long as it's not too 'shady'
###2460 Their headquarters, in Sidi Bel Abbes, in Algeria
###2463 now signs up a good number of Spanish Republicans.
###2466 Having fled from their country, after Franco's fascists' victory.
###2470 They now eager to fight the Nazis, who supported Franco.
###2478 They all make the long trip to France.
###2488 The Legionnaires embark at Brest, along with the well equipped "Chasseurs Alpins".
###2494 A mountain corp, trained for action in the snow.
###2500 But Finland and the Soviet Union sign a peace treaty.
###2504 A few days later, Hitler launches an offensive against Denmark and Norway.
###2510 The "Blitzkrieg", The Lightning War.
###2515 The Wehrmachts takes Oslo in 2 days.
###2520 Hitler is seeking to protect "The Iron Route".
###2523 Iron is indispensable to the German war effort,
###2526 and 50 percent of it Swedish iron ore is shipped out of the Norwegian port of Narvik.
###2539 The Franco-British Expedition Recon lands in the 'feoffee' of Narvik.
###2547 After a month of fighting, The Allies take Narvik.
###2551 The Iron Route is temporarily cut.
###2560 This victory is good for French morale and adds credence to their motto:
###2564 <i> We will win because we are the strongest. </ i>
###2568 But the expedition recon will have to abandon Narvik,
###2571 and for the rest of the war, train load after train load of Swedish iron ore
###2576 will feed the German war machines.

###2602 <i> Gentlemen, the offensive has just begun. </ i>
###2612 His generals has submitted him their battle plan during the winter.
###2616 It looks similar to that of 1914, attack through Belgium.
###2622 But Hitler preferred General von Manstein's idea.
###2626 Cutting straight through the Ardenne forest, and swinging up and driving towards the sea,
###2632 encircling the allies, with a circle cut movement.
###2636 But this circle-cut movement is, in fact, a huge gamble.
###2639 Because the Ally could turn back and counter attack.
###2644 However, Hitler is confident. He notes:
###2647 <i> The main thing is to have a good weather. </ i>
###2656 Lieutenant August von Kageneck claims:
###2659 <i> We are the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of greater Germany. </ i>
###2663 <i> Victory is certain. </ i>
###2689 For the German soldiers, their homeland is in danger.
###2693 After all it was the French who declared war on Germany.
###2699 May 10, 1940. At dawn, German parachuters make a jump over Holland.
###2706 Their mission is to capture the air fields and bridges around Rotterdam.
###2711 At the same time, Hitler unleashes his war machines on Belgium.

###2726 Will The Allies fall into the trap?
