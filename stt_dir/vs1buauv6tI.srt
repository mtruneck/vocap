0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:7,26



2
0:0:7,26 --> 0:0:9,685
MALE SPEAKER: Keep it stealth,
Mike, keep it stealth.


3
0:0:9,685 --> 0:0:10,71
AARON MEZA: How's it
going, Patrick?


4
0:0:10,71 --> 0:0:11,23
PATRICK O'DELL: Good.


5
0:0:11,23 --> 0:0:13,37
AARON MEZA: How many slams
have you taken?


6
0:0:13,37 --> 0:0:14,225
PATRICK O'DELL: I don't
even talk about it.


7
0:0:14,225 --> 0:0:15,735
Have you ever been on
this ferry before?


8
0:0:15,735 --> 0:0:16,735
AARON MEZA: Never.


9
0:0:16,735 --> 0:0:18,616
I've never really been
to Washington before.


10
0:0:18,616 --> 0:0:26,984



11
0:0:26,984 --> 0:0:28,99
PETER HEWITT: It's been a while
since I've been here,


12
0:0:28,99 --> 0:0:31,24
but I seem to remember it's
a nice little ride.


13
0:0:31,24 --> 0:0:33,27
There's all kinds of
stuff out there.


14
0:0:33,27 --> 0:0:36,6
I've seen porpoise, there's
orcas swimming around.


15
0:0:36,6 --> 0:0:38,49
I just saw a bald eagle
right over there.


16
0:0:38,49 --> 0:0:39,382
AARON MEZA: Really?


17
0:0:39,382 --> 0:0:40,274
PETER HEWITT: Yeah.


18
0:0:40,274 --> 0:0:41,524
Had a big ol' fish.


19
0:0:41,524 --> 0:0:49,25



20
0:0:49,25 --> 0:0:50,546
MALE SPEAKER: Where
are they going?


21
0:0:50,546 --> 0:0:51,89
MALE SPEAKER: They're
going to Orcas.


22
0:0:51,89 --> 0:0:53,14
So are we!


23
0:0:53,14 --> 0:1:12,3



24
0:1:12,3 --> 0:1:15,334
MALE SPEAKER: Big
roll, big roll!


25
0:1:15,334 --> 0:1:18,33
[YELLING]


26
0:1:18,33 --> 0:1:19,32
PATRICK O'DELL: What's up?


27
0:1:19,32 --> 0:1:21,78
We're on the ferry heading
to Orcas Island.


28
0:1:21,78 --> 0:1:23,34
There's a really good
park there.


29
0:1:23,34 --> 0:1:24,49
And everyone's going to skate.


30
0:1:24,49 --> 0:1:27,95
This the second demo
of the trip.


31
0:1:27,95 --> 0:1:28,56
It's been like a week
and a half so far,


32
0:1:28,56 --> 0:1:29,47
but only two demos.


33
0:1:29,47 --> 0:1:30,99
There's three demos total.


34
0:1:30,99 --> 0:1:32,13
I don't know if it'll
be crowded because


35
0:1:32,13 --> 0:1:33,8
it's hard to get to.


36
0:1:33,8 --> 0:1:34,55
But it's going to be big.


37
0:1:34,55 --> 0:1:36,94
Because everyone's really
amped to skate it.


38
0:1:36,94 --> 0:1:37,6
There's camping.


39
0:1:37,6 --> 0:1:39,39
We're going to camp for a couple
days on the island.


40
0:1:39,39 --> 0:1:41,82
We got to do like a long
hike to get there.


41
0:1:41,82 --> 0:1:46,4
And I don't know, I'm
pretty excited.


42
0:1:46,4 --> 0:1:47,0
MALE SPEAKER: Oh!


43
0:1:47,0 --> 0:1:48,44
That's so beautiful, dude.


44
0:1:48,44 --> 0:1:53,24



45
0:1:53,24 --> 0:1:55,563
Come on, little birdies.


46
0:1:55,563 --> 0:1:57,45
Come on, pelican.


47
0:1:57,45 --> 0:1:58,92
Oh, you got it, you got
it, you got it!


48
0:1:58,92 --> 0:2:1,65



49
0:2:1,65 --> 0:2:3,888
One of them's going to come
in hard on you dude.


50
0:2:3,888 --> 0:2:39,56



51
0:2:39,56 --> 0:2:42,37
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa!


52
0:2:42,37 --> 0:2:44,21
ROBBIE RUSSO: It's a good
day for flying a kite.


53
0:2:44,21 --> 0:2:56,18



54
0:2:56,18 --> 0:2:57,2
RICK HOWARD: Wow.


55
0:2:57,2 --> 0:2:58,27
Robbie!


56
0:2:58,27 --> 0:3:1,142



57
0:3:1,142 --> 0:3:4,4
He's going to get
it, this guy.


58
0:3:4,4 --> 0:3:5,69
AARON MEZA: Is that
your wizard stick?


59
0:3:5,69 --> 0:3:8,522



60
0:3:8,522 --> 0:3:10,41
MALE SPEAKER: Man,
yours is weak.


61
0:3:10,41 --> 0:3:11,78
MIKE CARROLL: I just
started, barely.


62
0:3:11,78 --> 0:3:15,409



63
0:3:15,409 --> 0:3:17,325
AARON MEZA: Is there always
a cup at the bottom?


64
0:3:17,325 --> 0:3:19,442
MIKE CARROLL: Well, I had
another cup, and I was going


65
0:3:19,442 --> 0:3:20,85
to try to put them together.


66
0:3:20,85 --> 0:3:23,71
Couple people said it's not
fair or it's against


67
0:3:23,71 --> 0:3:24,96
regulation.


68
0:3:24,96 --> 0:3:30,972



69
0:3:30,972 --> 0:3:32,674
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, whoa, whoa.


70
0:3:32,674 --> 0:3:41,4



71
0:3:41,4 --> 0:3:43,89
Epicly faded.


72
0:3:43,89 --> 0:3:45,14
Epicly O'Douled.


73
0:3:45,14 --> 0:3:50,946



74
0:3:50,946 --> 0:3:52,37
AARON MEZA: Brian.


75
0:3:52,37 --> 0:3:55,44
Did you just puke?


76
0:3:55,44 --> 0:3:57,16
Are you all right, Brian?


77
0:3:57,16 --> 0:3:57,82
That looked all red.


78
0:3:57,82 --> 0:3:59,46
BRIAN ANDERSON: I'll
be all right.


79
0:3:59,46 --> 0:4:0,69
It was red, huh?


80
0:4:0,69 --> 0:4:2,59
AARON MEZA: Yeah, it
looked like blood.


81
0:4:2,59 --> 0:4:4,5
Like I was freaked out.


82
0:4:4,5 --> 0:4:8,37
BRIAN ANDERSON: Yeah,
let's look at it.


83
0:4:8,37 --> 0:4:10,29
Does that look like blood?


84
0:4:10,29 --> 0:4:12,66
AARON MEZA: What did you eat?


85
0:4:12,66 --> 0:4:14,442
BRIAN ANDERSON: I don't
know, dude.


86
0:4:14,442 --> 0:4:19,854



87
0:4:19,854 --> 0:4:21,23
MALE SPEAKER: You did
puke up blood?


88
0:4:21,23 --> 0:4:22,62
BRIAN ANDERSON: I don't know.


89
0:4:22,62 --> 0:4:24,56
MALE SPEAKER: Did you have
anything, like Powerades to


90
0:4:24,56 --> 0:4:25,36
drink or anything?


91
0:4:25,36 --> 0:4:26,78
BRIAN ANDERSON: I probably
did, yeah.


92
0:4:26,78 --> 0:4:27,925
MALE SPEAKER: Put the
light on it again?


93
0:4:27,925 --> 0:4:29,61
TONY MIORANA: Yeah.


94
0:4:29,61 --> 0:4:31,91
Beer, blood.


95
0:4:31,91 --> 0:4:33,42
AARON MEZA: Looked really
red coming out of there.


96
0:4:33,42 --> 0:4:34,372
TONY MIORANA: OK.


97
0:4:34,372 --> 0:4:38,9
MALE SPEAKER: It's not thick
enough to be blood, though.


98
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:38,44
Beer blood?


99
0:4:38,44 --> 0:4:39,47
MALE SPEAKER: That's
what she said.


100
0:4:39,47 --> 0:4:42,494
AARON MEZA: Hey TMo, tell me
about your wizard stick


101
0:4:42,494 --> 0:4:44,7
TONY MIORANA: OK.


102
0:4:44,7 --> 0:4:45,61
The wizard stick's probably--
this is my first


103
0:4:45,61 --> 0:4:46,442
one I've ever done.


104
0:4:46,442 --> 0:4:49,56
But this tells exactly where
you are in the night.


105
0:4:49,56 --> 0:4:53,47
You can walk with anyone, they
can see how many heights they


106
0:4:53,47 --> 0:4:54,88
got, or how many cans
they got down.


107
0:4:54,88 --> 0:4:55,9
And if they're a real wizard.


108
0:4:55,9 --> 0:4:58,25
If they're not a wizard, you're
like, yeah, you only


109
0:4:58,25 --> 0:4:59,7
got four cans?


110
0:4:59,7 --> 0:5:1,285
Not worthy of even
hanging out with.


111
0:5:1,285 --> 0:5:3,545
Why would I even talk to you
right now, waste my time.


112
0:5:3,545 --> 0:5:4,595
I'm a real wizard.


113
0:5:4,595 --> 0:5:6,31
AARON MEZA: So how many
beers until it's


114
0:5:6,31 --> 0:5:7,73
official wizard status?


115
0:5:7,73 --> 0:5:8,57
TONY MIORANA: Your height.


116
0:5:8,57 --> 0:5:11,4
You can just cross it out in
front of your tent and say,


117
0:5:11,4 --> 0:5:12,1
don't cross this path.


118
0:5:12,1 --> 0:5:13,75
There's a drunk wizard
in here.


119
0:5:13,75 --> 0:5:15,275
Why would you mess with
a drunk wizard?


120
0:5:15,275 --> 0:5:24,55



121
0:5:24,55 --> 0:5:25,92
MALE SPEAKER: Regulation.


122
0:5:25,92 --> 0:5:27,2
AARON MEZA: Regulation what?


123
0:5:27,2 --> 0:5:28,34
MALE SPEAKER: Regulation
tape size to the can.


124
0:5:28,34 --> 0:5:29,203
MALE SPEAKER: Can't
waste the tape.


125
0:5:29,203 --> 0:5:31,432
MALE SPEAKER: That
shit's expensive.


126
0:5:31,432 --> 0:5:33,11
Just duct tape, baby.


127
0:5:33,11 --> 0:5:34,28
MIKE CARROLL: Can't
waste the tape.


128
0:5:34,28 --> 0:5:36,205
AARON MEZA: Preston, are
you a wizard yet?


129
0:5:36,205 --> 0:5:38,5
PRESTON: Nope.


130
0:5:38,5 --> 0:5:41,322
I'm an inch below.


131
0:5:41,322 --> 0:5:43,41
AARON MEZA: Even though you
got all those side beers?


132
0:5:43,41 --> 0:5:44,85
PRESTON: Yeah.


133
0:5:44,85 --> 0:5:45,74
Doesn't count.


134
0:5:45,74 --> 0:5:47,41
AARON MEZA: Had you known
that, would you


135
0:5:47,41 --> 0:5:47,71
still have done it?


136
0:5:47,71 --> 0:5:49,8
PRESTON: No, I'm just going to
keep it below my height all


137
0:5:49,8 --> 0:5:52,3
night so I don't ever
become a wizard.


138
0:5:52,3 --> 0:5:54,962
AARON MEZA: Rick, where's
your wizard staff?


139
0:5:54,962 --> 0:5:58,732
RICK HOWARD: I'm uh,
night off staff.


140
0:5:58,732 --> 0:6:0,75
AARON MEZA: You're going to win
the demo then, tomorrow.


141
0:6:0,75 --> 0:6:1,5
RICK HOWARD: I don't think so.


142
0:6:1,5 --> 0:6:2,45
I've got half a leg.


143
0:6:2,45 --> 0:6:4,26
One and a half legs, so.


144
0:6:4,26 --> 0:6:7,501
I'm doing the heel up today.


145
0:6:7,501 --> 0:6:9,41
MIKE CARROLL: Who's not
a wizard yet and


146
0:6:9,41 --> 0:6:10,135
wants to be a wizard?


147
0:6:10,135 --> 0:6:11,79
Let's do the shocker game.


148
0:6:11,79 --> 0:6:13,64
Ready?


149
0:6:13,64 --> 0:6:15,8
Set?


150
0:6:15,8 --> 0:6:17,179
Oh.


151
0:6:17,179 --> 0:6:19,544
MALE SPEAKER: (LAUGHING)
That's you.


152
0:6:19,544 --> 0:6:21,88
MALE SPEAKER: It
was that fast?


153
0:6:21,88 --> 0:6:24,49
MIKE CARROLL: It's not even that
fucking strong, though.


154
0:6:24,49 --> 0:6:25,51
That's what sucks.


155
0:6:25,51 --> 0:6:28,47
AARON MEZA: Robbie, put that
thing next to you.


156
0:6:28,47 --> 0:6:31,35
ROBBIE RUSSO: Fucking massive.


157
0:6:31,35 --> 0:6:33,91
MALE SPEAKER: I'm
Robbie Wizard.


158
0:6:33,91 --> 0:6:35,78
MALE SPEAKER: Use your
fucking brain, OK?


159
0:6:35,78 --> 0:6:37,5
You use your brain.


160
0:6:37,5 --> 0:6:37,58
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.


161
0:6:37,58 --> 0:6:38,75
If we shoot off a flash
right here--


162
0:6:38,75 --> 0:6:40,166
MALE SPEAKER: You got more
of a brain than both


163
0:6:40,166 --> 0:6:41,362
of us, so use it.


164
0:6:41,362 --> 0:6:45,356
MALE SPEAKER: Wow, that really
killed like, the rest of the


165
0:6:45,356 --> 0:6:45,88
camp, right?


166
0:6:45,88 --> 0:6:47,38
MALE SPEAKER: You got
your photo, man.


167
0:6:47,38 --> 0:6:50,965
That's a pretty good one.


168
0:6:50,965 --> 0:6:52,5
MALE SPEAKER: Turn
the light out.


169
0:6:52,5 --> 0:6:53,642
Turn that fucking
light out now.


170
0:6:53,642 --> 0:6:54,892
Ugh.


171
0:6:54,892 --> 0:6:59,5



172
0:6:59,5 --> 0:7:0,39
MALE SPEAKER: I'm so mad.


173
0:7:0,39 --> 0:7:2,62
You didn't drink
as much as me.


174
0:7:2,62 --> 0:7:5,64
That's what happens when
you're a weak bitch.


175
0:7:5,64 --> 0:7:7,595
And you can't drink
as much as me.


176
0:7:7,595 --> 0:7:10,38



177
0:7:10,38 --> 0:7:13,253
MIKE CARROLL: Sleeper
play fight.


178
0:7:13,253 --> 0:7:15,96
MALE SPEAKER: You just lost
your whole staff.


179
0:7:15,96 --> 0:7:18,32
You just lost your
whole staff.


180
0:7:18,32 --> 0:7:20,253
Your staff sucks.


181
0:7:20,253 --> 0:7:21,503
Your staff sucks!


182
0:7:21,503 --> 0:7:24,3



183
0:7:24,3 --> 0:7:24,646
All right.


184
0:7:24,646 --> 0:7:28,533
T, would you chill
the fuck out?


185
0:7:28,533 --> 0:7:31,36
You're going to get
fucking mopped up!


186
0:7:31,36 --> 0:7:32,33
MALE SPEAKER: Shh, shh.


187
0:7:32,33 --> 0:7:33,34
MALE SPEAKER: Chill.


188
0:7:33,34 --> 0:7:34,68
Chill.


189
0:7:34,68 --> 0:7:35,8
Ugh.


190
0:7:35,8 --> 0:7:36,58
I hate when you do
the feet thing.


191
0:7:36,58 --> 0:7:38,873
Stop with the feet thing.


192
0:7:38,873 --> 0:7:40,9
Stop with the feet thing.


193
0:7:40,9 --> 0:7:42,15
Stop with the feet thing.


194
0:7:42,15 --> 0:7:45,1



195
0:7:45,1 --> 0:7:46,26
We're friends!


196
0:7:46,26 --> 0:7:48,82



197
0:7:48,82 --> 0:7:49,56
Get away!


198
0:7:49,56 --> 0:7:50,81
We're hugging!


199
0:7:50,81 --> 0:7:54,44



200
0:7:54,44 --> 0:7:56,62
We're hugging.


201
0:7:56,62 --> 0:7:58,22
You better get me near
him right now.


202
0:7:58,22 --> 0:8:0,92
MALE SPEAKER: This is
aggressive hugging.


203
0:8:0,92 --> 0:8:2,73
MALE SPEAKER: Get me near him.


204
0:8:2,73 --> 0:8:5,424
Why are they holding us
back from one another?


205
0:8:5,424 --> 0:8:6,28
We're friends!


206
0:8:6,28 --> 0:8:7,61
MALE SPEAKER: Turn the fucking
light off. dude.


207
0:8:7,61 --> 0:10:7,61
