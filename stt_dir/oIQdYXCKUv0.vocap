###7 In Season One of the Story of Stuff, we looked at a system that creates way
###12 too much stuff, and way too little of what we really want.
###14 Now we're going to start looking at the stories behind the story of stuff.
###18 That's where we'll find ways to turn this situation around.
###21 Welcome to Season Two.
###31 Ever since I learned where our stuff really comes from - and how this system
###35 is trashing people and the planet - I've been trying to figure out how we can
###38 change it. I've read a lot of these: 100
###40 Ways to Save the Planet Without Leaving Your House,
###44 50 Simple Things You Can do to Save the Earth,
###46 The Little Green Book of Shopping. I thought they might have the
###51 answers, but their tips all start here
###52 with buying better stuff
###54 and they all end here - with recycling all that stuff when I'm done with it.
###58 But when it comes to making change, this story of "going green" - even though we
###62 see it everywhere -
###63 has some serious shortcomings.
###66 It says that if I become a smarter shopper,
###68 and tell my friends to do the same,
###70 I've done my part.
###72 And if I don't buy all this green stuff,
###74 then it's my fault that the planet's being destroyed.
###77 Wait a minute. My fault?
###78 I didn't choose to put toxic products on the shelves or to allow slave labor in
###82 factories around the world.
###84 I didn't choose to fill stores with electronics that can't be repaired
###88 and have to be thrown away. I didn't choose a world in which some people can
###92 afford to live green, leaving the rest of us to be irresponsible planet
###97 wreckers! Of course when we do shop we should buy the least toxic and most fair
###101 products we can,
###102 but it's not bad shoppers here who are the source of the problem, it's
###106 bad policies and bad business practices here.
###108 And that's why the solutions we really need aren't for sale at the supermarket.
###113 If we actually want to change the world,
###115 we can't talk only about consumers voting with our dollars.
###118 Real change happens when citizens come together to demand rules that work.
###123 Look, it is important to try to live green.
###125 As Gandhi said, “be the change.”
###128 Living our values in small ways shows ourselves and others we care.
###132 So it is a great place to start.
###135 But it's a terrible place to stop. After all, would we even know who Gandhi
###139 was if he just sewed his own clothes and then sat back waiting for the British to
###142 leave India?
###144 So how do we make big change?
###146 To answer that question,
###148 I went back and looked at Gandhi,
###149 the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, the U.S. Civil Rights Movement,
###153 and the environmental victories here in the 1970s.
###156 They didn't just nag people to perfect their day-to-day choices.
###160 They changed the rules of the game.
###162 It turns out, there are three things you find whenever people get together
###166 and actually change the world.
###168 First, they share a big idea for how things could be better.
###172 Not just a little better for a few people,
###174 a whole lot better for everyone.
###176 And they don't just tinker around the edges;
###178 they go right to the heart of the problem, even when it means changing
###182 systems that don't want to be changed.
###184 And that can be scary!
###186 Hey, millions of us already share a big idea for how things can be better.
###190 Instead of this dinosaur economy that focuses onlyon corporate profits -
###193 we want a new economy that puts safe products,
###196 happy people, and a healthy planet first.
###199 Duh, isn't that what an economy should be  for?
###203 Trying to live eco-perfectly in today's system is like trying to swim upstream,
###207 when the current is pushing us all the other way.
###210 But by changing what our economy prioritizes,
###212 we can change the current so that the right thing becomes the
###216 easiest thing to do.
###217 Second, the millions of ordinary people who made these extraordinary changes
###222 didn't try to do it alone.
###223 They didn't just say, “I will be more responsible.” They said, “We will work
###228 together until the problem is solved.”
###230 Today it's easier than ever to work together.
###232 Can you imagine how hard it was to get a message across India in 1930?
###237 We can do it now in less than a second.
###240 And finally, these movements succeeded in creating change because they took
###243 their big idea,
###245 and their commitment to work together,
###246 and then they took action!
###249 Did you know that when Martin Luther King junior organized his march on
###252 Washington,
###253 less than a quarter of Americans supported him?
###255 But that was enough to make change - because those supporters took action -
###259 they did stuff.
###261 Today 74% of Americans support tougher laws on toxic chemicals.
###265 83% want clean energy laws. 85% think corporations should have
###270 less influence in government.
###272 We've got the big idea and the commitment. We just haven't
###277 turned it all into massive action yet.
###278 And this is our only missing piece.
###280 So let's do it.
###282 Making real change takes all kinds of citizens -
###285 not just protestors.
###287 When you realize what you're good at and what you like to do,
###290 plugging in doesn't seem so hard.
###292 Whatever you have to offer, a better future needs it.
###295 So ask yourself,
###297 “What kind of change maker am I?”
###299 We need investigators,
###302 communicators,
###304 builders,
###307 resisters,
###309 nurturers,
###310 and networkers.
###313 At StoryofStuff.org,
###315 you can explore these types of change makers and find your first,
###318 or your next, step to take action.
###321 Being an engaged citizen starts with voting.
###324 That's one of those basic things that everyone's just gotta do.
###327 But it gets way more exciting - and fun - when we put our unique skills
###332 and interests to work alongside thousands of others.
###335 I know that changing a whole economic system is a huge challenge.
###339 It's not easy to see a clear path from where we are today to where we need to
###342 go.
###343 And there's no ten simple things we can do without leaving our couches!
###348 But the path didn't start out clear to all these guys either.
###351 Doctor King said, “Faith
###352 is taking the first step even though you don't see the whole staircase.”
###357 So, they worked hard to get organized,
###359 practiced the small acts that built their citizen muscles
###362 and kept their focus on their big idea -
###364 and when the time was right, they were ready.
###367 It's time for us to get ready too -
###369 ready to make change and write the next chapter
###372 in the story of stuff.
