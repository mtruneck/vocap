1
0:0:52,54 --> 0:1:7,72
"This is pointless."


2
0:1:7,72 --> 0:1:13,46
This is very good, Professor, thank you.


3
0:1:13,46 --> 0:1:19,5
That wasn't so hard, was it?


4
0:1:19,5 --> 0:1:21,1
So does this look wrong to you?


5
0:1:21,1 --> 0:1:23,26
"Yeah."


6
0:1:23,26 --> 0:1:25,97
"Because it is wrong."


7
0:1:25,97 --> 0:1:29,57
Because it's missing 'Bleem'.


8
0:1:29,57 --> 0:1:32,55
"You think I just made this up, don't you?"


9
0:1:32,55 --> 0:1:34,63
"Just pulled this number out of thin air, yah?"


10
0:1:34,63 --> 0:1:36,94
So you have discovered 'bleem' then?


11
0:1:36,94 --> 0:1:42,92
"I am not entertaining some delusion, Doctor. I am a mathematician -"


12
0:1:42,92 --> 0:1:45,25
"I am pursuing the truth."


13
0:1:45,25 --> 0:1:52,16
I'm sorry, I'm not trying to offend you, 
I'm just trying to understand.


14
0:1:52,16 --> 0:1:54,9
But I need you to help me understand.


15
0:1:54,9 --> 0:1:59,75
"Are you trying to understand 'bleem', Doctor?"


16
0:1:59,75 --> 0:2:48,71
"Or are you trying to understand >me<?"


17
0:2:48,71 --> 0:2:51,87
Okay, Professor.


18
0:2:51,87 --> 0:2:56,44
Let's assume that you're right and 'bleem' does exist.


19
0:2:56,44 --> 0:2:58,14
It'd be a counting number, right?


20
0:2:58,14 --> 0:3:0,73
"It is an integer, yah."


21
0:3:0,73 --> 0:3:2,9
Integer.


22
0:3:2,9 --> 0:3:7,96
So you go 1, 2, 3...


23
0:3:7,96 --> 0:3:11,59
…'bleem,'
4, 5, 6 - is that right?


24
0:3:11,59 --> 0:3:14,56
"Very good, Doctor"


25
0:3:14,56 --> 0:3:17,27
Right, so if that's true...


26
0:3:17,27 --> 0:3:21,95
...you should then be able to have 'bleem' of something, right?


27
0:3:21,95 --> 0:3:26,96
"Yeah."


28
0:3:26,96 --> 0:3:33,85
I'd like you to do me a favor, Professor.


29
0:3:33,85 --> 0:3:42,8
Separate out 'bleem' of those jellybeans for me.


30
0:3:42,8 --> 0:3:43,12
Please...


31
0:3:43,12 --> 0:4:35,99
...take your time.


32
0:4:35,99 --> 0:4:45,6
So 'bleem' is not an integer after all.


33
0:4:45,6 --> 0:4:49,3
Professor.


34
0:4:49,3 --> 0:4:50,94
So 'Bleem' is not an integer...


35
0:4:50,94 --> 0:4:52,87
"AHH!"


36
0:4:52,87 --> 0:4:55,16
"Bleem exists!"


37
0:4:55,16 --> 0:4:56,63
Calm down, Professor.


38
0:4:56,63 --> 0:4:59,46
"Something was preventing me--"


39
0:4:59,46 --> 0:5:3,2
I was sitting right here.  I was watching you the entire time--


40
0:5:3,2 --> 0:5:9,41
-- and there was nothing preventing you, except for the fact
that 'bleem' does not exist.


41
0:5:9,41 --> 0:5:15,78
"I must get back to my research..."


42
0:5:15,78 --> 0:5:20,6
I'm sorry, Professor. I'm afraid we're done for the day.


43
0:5:20,6 --> 0:5:23,49
"I just need something to write with."


44
0:5:23,49 --> 0:5:25,98
"Please. Pencil and paper is all I ask."


45
0:5:25,98 --> 0:5:45,42
We can talk about writing materials at your next evaluation, alright?


46
0:5:45,42 --> 0:5:48,13
"Doctor?"


47
0:5:48,13 --> 0:5:50,53
Take the Professor to his room.


48
0:5:50,53 --> 0:5:53,74
"Please, I am so close- I can feel it."


49
0:5:53,74 --> 0:5:54,92
We can pick this up tomorrow.


50
0:5:54,92 --> 0:5:55,89
"Come on, Professor."


51
0:5:55,89 --> 0:5:59,9
"No--"


52
0:5:59,9 --> 0:7:49,51
"Take it easy!"


53
0:7:49,51 --> 0:7:53,9
So would you say you are a man of reason, Professor?


54
0:7:53,9 --> 0:7:54,36
"Of course, yah."


55
0:7:54,36 --> 0:7:56,79
Well, I'm a little confused...


56
0:7:56,79 --> 0:8:2,76
...what reason could anybody possibly have to keep a number secret?


57
0:8:2,76 --> 0:8:11,3
"Why did they try to burn Galileo at the stake, Doctor? This is heresy to them."


58
0:8:11,3 --> 0:8:16,29
"We're talking about the very fabric of our universe here."


59
0:8:16,29 --> 0:8:21,83
"What do you know about higher dimensions, Doctor?"


60
0:8:21,83 --> 0:8:24,49
What, like parallel universes?


61
0:8:24,49 --> 0:8:29,58
"No, these are dimensions beyond what we can experience with our senses."


62
0:8:29,58 --> 0:8:35,94
"The first four are taken up by the Minkowski Space-Time,
which we live with every day."


63
0:8:35,94 --> 0:8:42,22
"But physicists now tell us there are at least seven more dimensions we cannot access."


64
0:8:42,22 --> 0:8:51,94
"Abstract dimensions that permeate everything - yet remain completely hidden."


65
0:8:51,94 --> 0:8:53,35
Alright.


66
0:8:53,35 --> 0:9:4,64
"We have no way to grasp the possibilities - to tap us the potential of these dimensions…
because we haven't got the math."


67
0:9:4,64 --> 0:9:10,2
So you are suggesting that with 'bleem'-


68
0:9:10,2 --> 0:9:16,58
"'Bleem' changes everything."


69
0:9:16,58 --> 0:10:7,48
Thank you, Professor.


70
0:10:7,48 --> 0:10:17,35
Hey!


71
0:10:17,35 --> 0:10:30,29
Hey!


72
0:10:30,29 --> 0:10:39,46
"This next report comes from Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where on Thursday
an unidentified man was struck and killed by a car near Pinewood Elementary school."


73
0:10:39,46 --> 0:10:49,88
"But beyond the tragedy, a mystery has emerged as authorities have
made no progress in determining the victim's identity in the three days
since the incident."


74
0:10:49,88 --> 0:10:57,48
"Police Chief Hal Malick is referring to the lack of any leads
as 'bizarre'. More on the story as it develops."


75
0:10:57,48 --> 0:11:20,79
"In other news..."


76
0:11:20,79 --> 0:11:42,75
Yeah?


77
0:11:42,75 --> 0:12:32,76
"We are doing a second sweep now. 
He was definitely here at bedcheck,
I haven't let anyone into the room."


78
0:12:32,76 --> 0:12:38,25
"Ah, looks like he left us a little snack."


79
0:12:38,25 --> 0:12:53,2
Don't touch those!


80
0:12:53,2 --> 0:13:38,86
"It's just jellybeans, Doc. Want one?"


81
0:13:38,86 --> 0:15:38,86
