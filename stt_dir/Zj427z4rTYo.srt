1
0:0:1,2 --> 0:0:4,54
texas and remind we've made great
headway know what what is more


2
0:0:4,54 --> 0:0:8,99
practicing in case you don't know which
if you watch the show slightly shocking


3
0:0:8,99 --> 0:0:11,469
k is we try to get money out of politics


4
0:0:11,469 --> 0:0:13,299
you do through a constitutional
amendment


5
0:0:13,299 --> 0:0:14,32
if you do it through it


6
0:0:14,32 --> 0:0:15,719
constitutional convention


7
0:0:15,719 --> 0:0:18,419
which is called for the state level why


8
0:0:18,419 --> 0:0:19,75
why


9
0:0:19,75 --> 0:0:22,199
but that the into the catalyst


10
0:0:22,199 --> 0:0:24,939
national politicians are so corrupt


11
0:0:24,939 --> 0:0:28,409
don't like your attitude towards of them
the same all yaya please stop the


12
0:0:28,409 --> 0:0:30,5
corruption take away all my donor money


13
0:0:30,5 --> 0:0:31,999
so the guy running against the


14
0:0:31,999 --> 0:0:34,7
could have just as good a chance is me


15
0:0:34,7 --> 0:0:36,26
dialogue ever going to do that


16
0:0:36,26 --> 0:0:39,6
that's why banking on the constitution
is a different


17
0:0:39,6 --> 0:0:41,53
uh... portion and it which says you
don't need to do with the federal


18
0:0:41,53 --> 0:0:42,309
congress


19
0:0:42,309 --> 0:0:45,19
is an important part of the constitution
the founding fathers put in there for a


20
0:0:45,19 --> 0:0:46,15
reason


21
0:0:46,15 --> 0:0:50,6
every once in a lifeguard constitutional
convention to and then the constitution


22
0:0:50,6 --> 0:0:51,879
not the redoing the constitution


23
0:0:51,879 --> 0:0:53,1
it is specific


24
0:0:53,1 --> 0:0:54,929
to and then the constitution


25
0:0:54,929 --> 0:0:58,179
and this is exactly what we need to do
demanded to get money out of politics


26
0:0:58,179 --> 0:0:59,7
so anyway it's a mess


27
0:0:59,7 --> 0:1:0,15
using because


28
0:1:0,15 --> 0:1:2,869
the best progress we've had is in texas
and in vermont


29
0:1:2,869 --> 0:1:5,16
the rest they analyst state


30
0:1:5,16 --> 0:1:10,37
and now what we need is a little bit al
from you guys in terms of volunteers


31
0:1:10,37 --> 0:1:13,25
uh... works on a local level and it's


32
0:1:13,25 --> 0:1:17,84

different as our corruption in other


43
0:1:40,62 --> 0:1:43,15
ways the state province of course from
time to time there is


44
0:1:43,15 --> 0:1:46,16
