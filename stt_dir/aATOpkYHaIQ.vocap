###0 STEVE SPANGLER: So today I'm on a quest to find out what
###2 floats and what sinks.
###5 I'm Steve Spangler.
###6 And I'm all about making science fun.
###8 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###11 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###14 experiences.
###15 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###17 affect the way people think about science.
###20 And do that, I live by one motto.
###22 Make it big.
###24 Do it right.
###25 Give it class.
###26 
###31 So let's find out simple things that
###33 will float and sink.
###35 Dennis, it's time to play float or sink.
###37 Do you want to pick something?
###38 
###40 That's perfect.
###42 Dust remover.
###44 I wonder-- rocket science-- what do you think?
###46 DENNIS: Floats.
###47 STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, you might want to think it again.
###49 DENNIS: Sinks.
###50 STEVE SPANGLER: See, always trust your first thing.
###52 See, that's why he didn't do well in school.
###54 Float or sink?
###55 What do you think?
###55 MALE SPEAKER: Well, it's going to sink.
###57 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, let's check and see.
###57 No, you're wrong.
###58 It floats.
###58 You're fired.
###60 Why don't we test this?
###62 Your stapler, float or sink?
###63 DENNIS: Sink.
###64 Definitely sink.
###65 STEVE SPANGLER: Are you sure?
###66 You want to change?
###66 DENNIS: Sink.
###67 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###67 Here we go.
###68 Nope, it floats.
###69 DENNIS: No, it doesn't.
###70 STEVE SPANGLER: Oh wait, it sinks.
###71 All right, so it sinks.
###72 All right, so you won that one.
###73 FEMALE SPEAKER: Sink.
###74 STEVE SPANGLER: All right.
###75 Let's check and see how smart she is.
###77 All of her pens.
###80 Some float and some sink.
###84 FEMALE SPEAKER: And some are ruined and some are--
###86 STEVE SPANGLER: I'm sorry.
###87 FEMALE SPEAKER: Watered down.
###88 STEVE SPANGLER: Look.
###89 The amazing thing is all the pens float.
###92 But the scissors sink.
###95 Isn't that an interesting thing to have happen?
###98 All right.
###99 I want you to get back to work.
###101 Enjoy your day working at Steve Spangler Science.
###105 FEMALE SPEAKER: I love my job.
###106 STEVE SPANGLER:And this is great.
###108 There you go.
###109 FEMALE SPEAKER: You know what--
###110 STEVE SPANGLER: There you go.
###111 Hey, let's see how iPhone float or sink.
###113 
###116 STEVE SPANGLER: Renee, what would float or sink?
###119 Let's see her hand.
###121 It sinks.
###122 Notice how it sinks very low.
###125 MALE SPEAKER: Get a piece of her car.
###126 STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.
###128 MALE SPEAKER: Pull off a piece of her car.
###130 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, there you go.
###132 Hey!
###132 FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm just kidding.
###133 STEVE SPANGLER: I got to get out of here.
###135 
###138 Oh, that's perfect!
###140 Here, can I have that?
###141 Thanks, Higginsworth.
###143 This is going to be perfect.
###144 
###147 This is perfect Diet Coke ready in our tank of floating
###151 and sinking wonders and mysteries of the universe.
###154 Float or sink?
###157 Let's see.
###157 Here we go.
###160 Yes.
###161 It's a floater.
###162 If you're a science person, you can't just sit there and
###165 say, well, it just floats and I don't know why.
###167 So I took all my lunch money, and now I'm going to test all
###171 of these cans.
###173 There we go.
###174 Ready?
###176 That's a sinker.
###178 All right.
###178 And a floater goes over here.
###181 Here we go.
###182 
###184 Two sinkers.
###185 Got it?
###186 All right, here we go.
###188 And here we go.
###190 And this one is a--
###191 look at this.
###193 All right, here we go.
###195 Sink and sink.
###196 All right, so this is it.
###197 These are the sinkers right here.
###199 These are the floaters over here.
###202 It's our job to figure out the difference between the sinkers
###206 and the floaters.
###207 I know exactly what you're thinking.
###209 The scientific way would be to first of all look at the
###211 volume of each can, because we'll need to see if the
###213 amount in each can is the same.
###215 That means we need to take a look at the amount right here.
###218 Let's line them up.
###219 
###223 Take a look at this.
###225 355, 355, 355.
###228 If you're metrically challenged, that's 12 ounces.
###231 Stick with metrics.
###231 355.
###232 Now let's take a look at the ones that floated.
###236 There's one.
###237 There's one.
###239 Here's one.
###241 And here's this guy here.
###243 It's the same, 355.
###245 Each one of these has the same amount of
###246 liquid that's inside.
###248 And we can only speculate that the volume of the can is
###251 exactly the same, because look, they're identical all
###253 the way across.
###255 It must be what's inside the can that makes all the
###257 difference.
###259 Time to look at the label.
###260 Let's move this out of the way and analyze cans from each of
###263 the two groups.
###265 Float goes over here.
###267 The sink goes over here.
###270 And these--
###271 Here's something that Americans haven't read in a
###273 long time, judging from waistline.
###276 140 calories in this one, 0 calories in this one.
###280 But that doesn't really mean anything until you go down a
###283 little bit further.
###284 The only noticeable difference, in the one that
###287 sinks, it's 39 grams of carbohydrates.
###291 The noticeable difference, the one that floats, 0 grams of
###294 carbohydrates.
###295 But what does that really mean?
###296 Carbohydrates mean sugar, a lot of sugar.
###302 And the average American consumes nearly 50 gallons of
###307 this sugar-packed soda every single year.
###310 That's a lot of sugar.
###312 And if you think about it, there should be a weight
###314 difference between the cans because if density equals mass
###317 divided by volume, and the volume is the same on both of
###320 them, it means the amount of stuff in each of those cans
###323 must be different.
###324 It's time to weigh it.
###325 All right, take a look at this.
###328 389 grams for the one that sinks.
###332 And the diet, 370 grams.
###336 That's nearly 20 grams.
###338 And it's all sugar.
###340 But what does that really look like?
###343 A packet of sugar, that's easy enough.
###345 How many packets of sugar are in that can of regular soda?
###350 Well, of course, there's more than one.
###351 How about this 1, 2.
###353 Keep going, 3.
###355 And I got a bunch of them.
###356 Just stop me when we're ready.
###357 4, 5, 6-- no, keep going--
###361 7, 8, 9, 10-- no, keep going--
###364 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 packets of sugar.
###371 Nutritionists say the equivalent of sugar in that
###374 can of soda is nearly 18 packets of sugar.
###378 Now, let's say you go home and on your way home, you're
###381 thirsty, so you go get one of those bladder busting cups
###384 that's 60 ounces.
###385 That's nearly 100 packs of sugar.
###389 So let's say that you just wanted one of these a day.
###392 365 days, what could that do to you?
###394 Well, after 365 days, you've eaten the equivalent of 3,650
###400 teaspoons of sugar.
###401 That's 32 pounds, or 14.5 kilograms of sugar.
###406 All this talk of sugar is making me hungry.
###408 And who doesn't like a gummy bear?
###411 You ever heard of a kid being all hyped up on sugar?
###413 Well, my question is so how much energy is in just one
###416 tiny little gummy bear?
###417 Let's go figure it out.
###419 Well, this is where we need safety glasses.
###421 And we're also going to need a strong oxidizer.
###424 This is where we're using this oxidizer here
###426 called potassium chlorate.
###428 And this is the part where I have to tell you don't try
###429 this at home.
###431 Try it at a chemistry teacher's home.
###432 Wait until you get to college.
###434 I don't care.
###434 Just don't try it at home.
###436 Potassium chlorate has oxygen molecules that we can liberate
###442 fairly easily with some heat and an organic material.
###446 And potassium chlorate has a fairly high melting point.
###450 That's why we're going to need to use some fire.
###451 
###456 You can see that it's finally melting.
###459 And it's just about ready for some gummy bears.
###463 So let's see how much energy we can release by simply
###465 dropping three of the gummy bears
###468 into our strong oxidizer.
###469 Watch.
###471 
###476 There's a tremendous amount of energy being release in just
###478 three gummy bears.
###480 The strong oxidizer touches the organic,
###482 which is the sugar.
###483 In fact, we're just figuring out how much energy is trapped
###487 in three gummy bears.
###490 What remains from this smoky mess is just a small amount of
###494 carbon that's at the bottom of the beaker.
###498 Well, the producers at the Ellen DeGeneres Show liked
###500 that experiment.
###501 But they wanted to know what would happen if we took it to
###503 an extreme level.
###504 And I'd never seen anybody do it in a
###506 five liter flask before.
###509 The question was just how much smoke would it produce.
###511 They weren't worried about that.
###512 And trust me, there was a tremendous number of
###514 firefighters that were on the set.
###517 Take a look.
###518 Have you ever heard somebody talk about a sugar high?
###521 They say kids have a sugar high?
###522 So I have gummy bears.
###524 So these are little gummy bears.
###525 And they're packed with energy.
###527 So when you get them to a kid, of course, they're crazy.
###530 So here's what I have here is I have this liquid.
###533 It's not just gummy bears you feed to a kid that is crazy.
###536 It's just candy in general.
###537 I have a liquid here that's full of oxygen.
###539 And it's a great oxidizer.
###541 So what I'm going to do is take some of the gummy bears
###543 and I'm going to drop them down inside.
###544 And I'm going to show you how to release the energy from the
###546 gummy bears.
###547 ELLEN DEGENERES: What's the liquid in there?
###548 STEVE SPANGLER: It's an oxidizer.
###550 It's called potassium chlorate.
###551 It's an oxidizer.
###552 So you stand back just a little bit.
###554 You're perfect right there.
###555 OK, ready?
###556 So I'm going to drop them in here like this.
###557 So watch this.
###558 Oh, beautiful.
###558 Look at the energy that comes out.
###560 Isn't that amazing?
###561 ELLEN DEGENERES: That's amazing.
###562 STEVE SPANGLER: That glow.
###562 ELLEN DEGENERES: Wow.
###563 STEVE SPANGLER: Wow.
###564 It never does that at home.
###567 ELLEN DEGENERES: And the noise!
###568 STEVE SPANGLER: Do you hear it howling?
###569 So we call it screaming gummy bears.
###571 And the fumes are only slightly toxic, which is nice.
###575 ELLEN DEGENERES: Oh, that's nice.
###576 So I'm glad I'm not wearing--
###577 STEVE SPANGLER: No, it's fine.
###578 And the nice thing about this is that it
###579 smells like a campfire.
###580 Well, in order to make candy, believe it or not, you need to
###583 know something about the chemistry of sucrose.
###585 And this is a simple sucrose molecule.
###587 Take a look.
###588 The black here represents carbon.
###589 There are 12 of the carbons.
###590 There are 22 hydrogens, which are the white ones.
###593 And there are 11 oxygens that you see here.
###597 And the difference between somebody who really knows how
###599 to make candy and somebody like me who's just cooking
###601 sugar is that the chef knows how long to cook that sugar so
###605 that they can literally just make the water molecules start
###608 to evaporate.
###609 While we're not going to cook that molecule, there is a way,
###612 using some chemistry, that we can make all those water
###615 molecules come right off.
###618 For this demonstration, we're going to need to have some
###620 gloves and some powdered sugar.
###624 Into the beaker it goes.
###626 And that's the perfect amount.
###629 And the reason for the safety glasses and the gloves, this
###633 bad stuff right here, sulfuric acid.
###635 If you read the label, you would think that
###636 sulfuric acid is strong.
###638 Is says 18 molar, which indicates the
###640 strength of the acid.
###641 However, chemically speaking, it's a fairly weak acid.
###644 The real danger around sulfuric acid, believe it or
###646 not, is when it gets in contact with water.
###648 And since we know that there's water there in sugar, it
###650 should be an easy way for us to pull it out.
###653 So here's what happens.
###654 We take the sulfuric acid and pour the
###655 sulfuric acid into here.
###657 And now we mix it around.
###659 Watch what happens as it starts to turn black.
###661 We mix it around like this and really get it mixed up.
###664 It starts to become very, very, very hot as we mix it.
###667 And now watch what happens when it takes off.
###669 
###674 What you see coming off is all of that water vapor, some
###676 fumes, and of course we have the black carbon remaining
###681 from that simple sugar molecule.
###683 Higginsworth, you're a good friend.
###684 Thanks for letting me have your soda.
###686 You take that and buy whatever you want.
###688 HIGGINSWORTH: Thanks, Steve.
###689 STEVE SPANGLER: You're a good guy.
###691 Little does Higginsworth know that his body is going to
###694 change with all that sugar.
###696 It's going to transform into something
###698 that looks like this.
