1
0:0:7,34 --> 0:0:9,842
THE MATURE SPERM
IN THE EPIDIDYMIS


2
0:0:9,842 --> 0:0:13,179
WILL PASS OUT OF THE MAN'S BODY
THROUGH EJACULATION


3
0:0:13,179 --> 0:0:17,35
200 TO 300 MILLION AT A TIME


4
0:0:17,35 --> 0:0:23,756
OR THEY WILL EVENTUALLY DIE
AND BE REABSORBED.


5
0:0:23,756 --> 0:0:26,359
THESE SPERM CARRY
THE MAN'S GENETIC MATERIAL


6
0:0:26,359 --> 0:0:31,498
AND THEY ARE FULLY MATURE.


7
0:0:31,498 --> 0:0:35,602
BUT THEY ARE NOT YET ABLE
TO FERTILIZE A WOMAN'S EGG.


8
0:0:35,602 --> 0:0:38,504
THEY DO NOT ATTAIN THAT ABILITY


9
0:0:38,504 --> 0:0:48,38
UNTIL THEY ARE ACTUALLY FAR UP
INSIDE THE WOMAN'S BODY.


10
0:0:48,38 --> 0:0:50,416
THEY MAY STAY IN THE EPIDIDYMIS


11
0:0:50,416 --> 0:0:52,318
THE BAG-LIKE STRUCTURE
ON THE LEFT


12
0:0:52,318 --> 0:0:57,79
FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.


13
0:0:57,79 --> 0:1:4,997
WHILE HERE, THEY DEVELOP
THE ABILITY TO SWIM.


14
0:1:4,997 --> 0:1:7,32
A SPERM PROPELS ITSELF


15
0:1:7,32 --> 0:1:10,136
BY MEANS OF A LONG TAIL,
A FLAGELLUM


16
0:1:10,136 --> 0:1:13,873
WHICH LASHES VIGOROUSLY
FROM SIDE TO SIDE.


17
0:1:13,873 --> 0:1:17,943
THIS EXTRAORDINARY ACTIVITY
HAS BUT A SINGLE PURPOSE:


18
0:1:17,943 --> 0:1:22,114
TO DELIVER THE GENETIC MATERIAL
IN THE SPERM'S HEAD


19
0:1:22,114 --> 0:1:25,585
QUICKLY AND PRECISELY
TO THE WOMAN'S EGG.


20
0:1:25,585 --> 0:1:29,222
ON THE TIP OF THE SPERM'S HEAD
IS A LAYER OF ENZYMES


21
0:1:29,222 --> 0:1:31,57
AND ENZYME INHIBITORS.


22
0:1:31,57 --> 0:1:33,659
THE INHIBITORS
PRESERVE THE ENZYMES


23
0:1:33,659 --> 0:1:36,95
WHICH WILL BE NEEDED LATER


24
0:1:36,95 --> 0:1:39,265
TO PENETRATE
THE SURFACE OF THE EGG.


25
0:1:39,265 --> 0:1:44,303
THIS IS HOW THE SPERM'S HEAD
LOOKS WITHOUT ITS ENZYME CAP.


26
0:1:44,303 --> 0:1:47,373
THE MATERIAL OF THE HEAD
ITSELF IS LOADED


27
0:1:47,373 --> 0:1:50,309
WITH THE ACTUAL
GENETIC INFORMATION


28
0:1:50,309 --> 0:1:52,812
WHICH WILL BE TRANSMITTED
TO THE EGG.


29
0:1:52,812 --> 0:1:55,681
THESE ARE THE STRANDS OF DNA


30
0:1:55,681 --> 0:2:0,619
WHICH WILL BE TRANSFORMED
INTO CHROMOSOMES.


31
0:2:0,619 --> 0:2:3,422
THIS IS ONE OF
THE MANY FUEL PACKETS


32
0:2:3,422 --> 0:2:6,192
ARRANGED ALONG
THE MIDPIECE OF THE SPERM.


33
0:2:6,192 --> 0:2:9,27
THE FUEL CONSISTS OF SUGARS


34
0:2:9,27 --> 0:2:14,934
WHICH IS CONVERTED INTO ENERGY
FOR THE SPERM'S LOCOMOTION.


35
0:2:14,934 --> 0:2:18,571
THE PROPULSION SYSTEM
OF THE SPERM'S TAIL


36
0:2:18,571 --> 0:2:24,577
IS MADE UP OF A BUNDLE
OF CORDS, OR FILAMENTS.


37
0:2:24,577 --> 0:2:29,48
THE FILAMENTS ARE COVERED
WITH THOUSANDS OF TINY HOOKS.


38
0:2:29,48 --> 0:2:33,319
AS THE HOOKS INTERMESH,
THE WHOLE BUNDLE BEGINS TO BEND


39
0:2:33,319 --> 0:2:40,559
AND THE TAILS OF THE SPERM
BEGIN TO WHIP AROUND LIKE THIS.


40
0:2:40,559 --> 0:2:51,271
IT IS A PRIMITIVE, BUT HIGHLY
EFFICIENT, SYSTEM OF PROPULSION.


41
0:2:51,271 --> 0:2:59,78
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT
FUNCTION PERFECTLY EVERY TIME.


42
0:2:59,78 --> 0:3:3,16
ON THE AVERAGE, UP TO 20%
OF A NORMAL MAN'S SPERM


43
0:3:3,16 --> 0:3:10,856
ARE DEFORMED
OR IMPERFECT IN SOME WAY.


44
0:3:10,856 --> 0:3:14,827
PERHAPS ONE REASON WHY A MAN
PRODUCES SO VERY MANY SPERM


45
0:3:14,827 --> 0:3:17,53
IS THAT SO VERY MANY THINGS
CAN GO WRONG


46
0:3:17,53 --> 0:3:22,1
WITH THE SPERM THEMSELVES.


47
0:3:22,1 --> 0:3:25,337
THEY MAY HAVE TWO TAILS,
LIKE THIS ONE.


48
0:3:25,337 --> 0:3:30,81
SOME EVEN HAVE THREE TAILS.


49
0:3:30,81 --> 0:3:35,47
IN ANOTHER COMMON DEFORMITY,
THE HEADS OF THESE SPERM


50
0:3:35,47 --> 0:3:38,517
APPEAR TO BE NEARLY SEVERED
FROM THEIR TAILS.


51
0:3:38,517 --> 0:3:45,357
THIS SPERM HAS BEEN ATTACKED
BY BACTERIA.


52
0:3:45,357 --> 0:3:49,395
AND THIS ONE MAY HAVE
BEEN PRODUCED TOO RAPIDLY.


53
0:3:49,395 --> 0:3:54,7
IT WILL NEVER COMPLETE
ITS DEVELOPMENT.


54
0:3:54,7 --> 0:3:58,337
WHITE BLOOD CORPUSCLES,
THE LARGE, ROUND CELLS


55
0:3:58,337 --> 0:4:1,607
ARE OFTEN FOUND TOGETHER
WITH DEFECTIVE SPERM.


56
0:4:1,607 --> 0:4:4,71
THEIR PRESENCE INDICATES
THE LIKELIHOOD


57
0:4:4,71 --> 0:4:8,38
OF INFECTION, FEVER
OR EVEN A COMMON COLD.


58
0:4:8,38 --> 0:4:11,416
MOST OF THESE SPERM DEFORMITIES
COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED


59
0:4:11,416 --> 0:4:13,886
BY JUST A SLIGHT ELEVATION


60
0:4:13,886 --> 0:4:19,591
IN THE TEMPERATURE
OF THE TESTICLES.


61
0:4:19,591 --> 0:4:26,966
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, TOO,
OFTEN DAMAGE SPERM PRODUCTION.


62
0:4:26,966 --> 0:4:30,2
OVERCROWDING...


63
0:4:30,2 --> 0:4:32,305
STRESS...


64
0:4:32,305 --> 0:4:35,207
SMOKING...


65
0:4:35,207 --> 0:4:38,244
CHEMICAL POLLUTION
OF AIR AND WATER...


66
0:4:38,244 --> 0:4:41,413
OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS...


67
0:4:41,413 --> 0:4:43,315
RADIATION...


68
0:4:43,315 --> 0:4:46,252
POOR NUTRITION...


69
0:4:46,252 --> 0:4:50,389
ALL PART OF MODERN LIFE.


70
0:4:50,389 --> 0:4:55,427
EVEN OUR MODERN CLOTHING
MAY AFFECT SPERM PRODUCTION.


71
0:4:55,427 --> 0:4:57,496
TIGHT BLUE JEANS, FOR EXAMPLE


72
0:4:57,496 --> 0:4:59,966
HOLD THE TESTICLES
UP CLOSE TO THE BODY


73
0:4:59,966 --> 0:5:2,134
PERHAPS RAISING
THEIR TEMPERATURE


74
0:5:2,134 --> 0:5:4,37
THOSE FEW CRITICAL DEGREES.


75
0:5:4,37 --> 0:5:6,338
BUT IN SPITE OF SUCH OBSTACLES


76
0:5:6,338 --> 0:5:9,408
HUMAN BEINGS HAVE BEEN
SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCING


77
0:5:9,408 --> 0:5:14,747
FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS.


78
0:5:14,747 --> 0:5:17,449
SINCE THE FIRST ORGANISMS
SWAM IN THE SEA


79
0:5:17,449 --> 0:5:20,352
THE CYCLE OF LIFE
HAS BEEN CONTINUOUS


80
0:5:20,352 --> 0:5:28,928
FUELED BY THE NEED
AND THE DRIVE TO REPRODUCE.


81
0:5:28,928 --> 0:5:31,53
AMONG HUMAN BEINGS


82
0:5:31,53 --> 0:5:43,876
THAT DRIVE IS INTIMATELY LINKED
WITH ATTRACTION AND DESIRE.


83
0:5:43,876 --> 0:5:49,148
AFFECTION AND ROMANTIC LOVE MAY
INITIATE THE DANCE OF COURTSHIP


84
0:5:49,148 --> 0:6:1,46
WHICH MAY LEAD TO CONCEPTION.


85
0:6:1,46 --> 0:6:4,696
SEXUALITY, AFFECTION
AND TENDERNESS


86
0:6:4,696 --> 0:6:21,13
CAN ALL BE PART OF
THE COMPLEX RITUALS OF MATING.


87
0:6:21,13 --> 0:6:24,116
BUT DESIRE AND PHYSICAL LOVE


88
0:6:24,116 --> 0:6:28,87
POSSESS A SILENT LANGUAGE
ALL THEIR OWN


89
0:6:28,87 --> 0:6:33,25
THAT SIGNAL PARTNERS'
READINESS TO EACH OTHER.


90
0:6:33,25 --> 0:6:39,498
THE EYES ARE PART
OF THAT SILENT LANGUAGE.


91
0:6:39,498 --> 0:6:43,535
VISUAL IMPRESSIONS STIMULATE
AND EXCITE SPECIAL NERVE CELLS


92
0:6:43,535 --> 0:6:49,107
IN THE SEXUAL AREAS
THROUGHOUT THE BODY.


93
0:6:49,107 --> 0:6:54,246
THE SKIN, TOO, IS PART
OF THE SILENT LANGUAGE.


94
0:6:54,246 --> 0:7:1,787
IT IS AMAZINGLY SENSITIVE
AND RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCH.


95
0:7:1,787 --> 0:7:5,124
IT CONTAINS MILLIONS
OF THESE SENSORY RECEPTORS


96
0:7:5,124 --> 0:7:7,293
WHICH WHEN STIMULATED


97
0:7:7,293 --> 0:7:10,662
DIRECT MESSAGES
OF SEXUAL AROUSAL TO THE BRAIN.


98
0:7:10,662 --> 0:7:13,232
MANY OF THESE ARE CONCENTRATED


99
0:7:13,232 --> 0:7:17,102
IN THE BODY'S MOST RESPONSIVE
AREAS: THE EROGENOUS ZONES.


100
0:7:17,102 --> 0:7:19,605
ONE OF THESE, THE MAN'S PENIS


101
0:7:19,605 --> 0:7:22,875
IS DENSELY PACKED
WITH SENSORY RECEPTORS--


102
0:7:22,875 --> 0:7:25,911
HERE SEEN AT
ENORMOUS MAGNIFICATION.


103
0:7:25,911 --> 0:7:30,249
THEY RELAY MESSAGES OF
SEXUAL STIMULATION TO THE BRAIN


104
0:7:30,249 --> 0:7:33,185
WHICH TRIGGERS THE COMPLEX
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS


105
0:7:33,185 --> 0:7:36,88
LEADING UP TO EJACULATION.


106
0:7:36,88 --> 0:7:39,925
THE LENGTH OF THE PENIS IS
MADE UP OF MANY SMALL CAVITIES


107
0:7:39,925 --> 0:7:42,528
CALLED ERECTILE TISSUE.


108
0:7:42,528 --> 0:7:47,632
WHEN A MAN IS SEXUALLY AROUSED,
THE SIGNALS FROM THE BRAIN


109
0:7:47,632 --> 0:8:3,582
CAUSE THESE ERECTILE TISSUES
TO BECOME ENGORGED WITH BLOOD.


110
0:8:3,582 --> 0:8:8,12
AS WE CAN SEE IN THESE IMAGES
FROM THE THERMAL CAMERA


111
0:8:8,12 --> 0:8:18,53
THE SUDDEN FLOW OF BLOOD TO THE
PENIS RAISES ITS TEMPERATURE.


112
0:8:18,53 --> 0:8:21,33
THE MAN'S BLOOD PRESSURE,
HEARTBEAT


113
0:8:21,33 --> 0:8:24,97
AND RESPIRATION INCREASE.


114
0:8:24,97 --> 0:8:29,775
AND THE BLOOD CAUSES THE PENIS
TO BECOME ERECT AND ELONGATED


115
0:8:29,775 --> 0:8:37,49
SO THAT SPERM CAN BE MOST EASILY
DELIVERED TO THE WOMAN'S EGG.


116
0:8:37,49 --> 0:8:41,32
IN THE EPIDIDYMIS, THE HUNDREDS
OF MILLIONS OF WAITING SPERM


117
0:8:41,32 --> 0:8:44,657
WHICH WILL SOON BE EXPELLED
FROM THE MAN'S BODY


118
0:8:44,657 --> 0:8:47,693
ACCUMULATE IN A MASS.


119
0:8:47,693 --> 0:8:50,929
AS SEXUAL AROUSAL
REACHES ITS PEAK


120
0:8:50,929 --> 0:8:55,133
THE ENTIRE MALE SEXUAL SYSTEM
MUST FUNCTION PERFECTLY


121
0:8:55,133 --> 0:8:59,538
FOR EJACULATION TO TAKE PLACE.


122
0:8:59,538 --> 0:9:4,377
COWPER'S GLAND...


123
0:9:4,377 --> 0:9:5,711
PROSTATE...


124
0:9:5,711 --> 0:9:8,514
SEMINAL VESICLES...


125
0:9:8,514 --> 0:9:17,59
AND EPIDIDYMIS.


126
0:9:17,59 --> 0:9:21,26
THIS IS THE ACTUAL JOURNEY
MADE BY THE SPERM.


127
0:9:21,26 --> 0:9:23,829
AT THE CLIMAX OF SEXUAL AROUSAL


128
0:9:23,829 --> 0:9:26,766
THE MAN'S NERVOUS
SYSTEM TRIGGERS


129
0:9:26,766 --> 0:9:29,634
RAPID INVOLUNTARY CONTRACTIONS
OF THE MUSCLES


130
0:9:29,634 --> 0:9:32,237
IN THE WALLS OF THE EPIDIDYMIS.


131
0:9:32,237 --> 0:9:36,842
THESE PROPEL THE SPERM
UP INTO THE MAN'S BODY


132
0:9:36,842 --> 0:9:40,913
ALONG THIS TUNNEL-LIKE TUBE,
THE VAS DEFERENS.


133
0:9:40,913 --> 0:9:44,583
THE SPERM THEMSELVES
TRAVEL THE DISTANCE--


134
0:9:44,583 --> 0:9:54,759
A LITTLE OVER 12 INCHES--
IN ONLY A FEW SECONDS.


135
0:9:54,759 --> 0:9:58,97
THE SEMINAL VESICLES
RELEASE NOURISHING FRUCTOSE


136
0:9:58,97 --> 0:10:4,903
WHICH BLENDS WITH THE SPERM
AS THEY PASS BY.


137
0:10:4,903 --> 0:10:11,177
THEY MIX WITH
THE PROSTATE FLUID.


138
0:10:11,177 --> 0:10:15,147
THE BLENDED SEMEN
APPROACHES THE URETHRA.


139
0:10:15,147 --> 0:10:25,724
ITS TOTAL VOLUME IS ACTUALLY
ABOUT ONE HALF A TEASPOON.


140
0:10:25,724 --> 0:10:33,866
THIS IS THE LAST LEG
OF THE JOURNEY.


141
0:10:33,866 --> 0:10:38,303
THE SEMEN CONTAINING THE SPERM
IS FORCED OUT THROUGH THE PENIS


142
0:10:38,303 --> 0:10:46,645
BY THE MAN'S
MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS.


143
0:10:46,645 --> 0:11:16,41
AND AT LAST, IT IS EJACULATED
INTO THE WOMAN'S VAGINA.


144
0:11:16,41 --> 0:11:19,211
AS THE SEMEN ENTERS
THE WOMAN'S BODY


145
0:11:19,211 --> 0:11:37,53
IT IMMEDIATELY SLOWS DOWN
AND COAGULATES.


146
0:11:37,53 --> 0:11:40,165
PERHAPS IT BECOMES THICKER


147
0:11:40,165 --> 0:11:44,87
TO ENSURE THAT MOST OF THE SPERM
STAY WITHIN THE VAGINA


148
0:11:44,87 --> 0:11:48,84
OR PERHAPS THE COAGULATION
IS A KIND OF DEFENSE


149
0:11:48,84 --> 0:11:54,546
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IN
THE VAGINA IS EXTREMELY ACID.


150
0:11:54,546 --> 0:12:0,251
THE ACIDITY PROTECTS THE WOMAN
AGAINST BACTERIA AND INFECTIONS


151
0:12:0,251 --> 0:12:5,824
BUT IT IS ALSO DANGEROUSLY
INHOSPITABLE TO THE SPERM.


152
0:12:5,824 --> 0:12:17,102
NEARLY ONE-QUARTER OF THEM
WILL DIE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.


153
0:12:17,102 --> 0:12:19,171
ABOUT 20 MINUTES
AFTER EJACULATION


154
0:12:19,171 --> 0:12:22,73
THE SEMEN BECOMES FLUID AGAIN.


155
0:12:22,73 --> 0:12:25,211
THE SURVIVING SPERM
BECOME VIGOROUSLY ACTIVE


156
0:12:25,211 --> 0:12:28,346
SWIMMING RAPIDLY AGAINST
THE DOWNWARD CURRENTS


157
0:12:28,346 --> 0:12:32,184
IN THE WOMAN'S BODY.


158
0:12:32,184 --> 0:12:34,419
THERE IS GREAT URGENCY


159
0:12:34,419 --> 0:12:38,757
FOR THE SPERM WILL REMAIN
VIABLE-- ABLE TO FERTILIZE--


160
0:12:38,757 --> 0:12:48,467
FOR ONLY 28 TO 48 HOURS.


161
0:12:48,467 --> 0:12:52,972
THIS IS THE SOUND MADE
BY THOUSANDS OF ACTIVE SPERM.


162
0:12:52,972 --> 0:13:5,484
(<i> rumbling</i> )


163
0:13:5,484 --> 0:13:9,254
THE SPERM'S GREAT ACTIVITY
HAS BUT ONE GOAL:


164
0:13:9,254 --> 0:13:12,391
TO FIND AND FERTILIZE THE EGG.


165
0:13:12,391 --> 0:13:16,862
THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM
THAT SUCCESS MIGHT SEEM ASSURED


166
0:13:16,862 --> 0:13:24,869
BUT THE BARRIERS, TOO,
ARE NUMEROUS.


167
0:13:24,869 --> 0:13:27,639
THE HIGH PERCENTAGE
OF DEFECTIVE SPERM


168
0:13:27,639 --> 0:13:37,816
HAS ALREADY LOWERED THE ODDS.


169
0:13:37,816 --> 0:13:55,801
SO HAS THE VAGINA'S
HOSTILE, ACID ENVIRONMENT.


170
0:13:55,801 --> 0:13:59,905
AND THE WOMAN'S OWN DEFENSE
SYSTEM ATTACKS THE SPERM.


171
0:13:59,905 --> 0:14:3,475
THEY ARE UNWELCOME CELLS
FROM ANOTHER ORGANISM


172
0:14:3,475 --> 0:14:7,913
AND THEY ARE POTENTIAL ENEMIES.


173
0:14:7,913 --> 0:14:11,65
HER DEFENSE CELLS AGGRESSIVELY
PROTECT HER FROM THE INVADERS


174
0:14:11,65 --> 0:14:27,99
BY DESTROYING THEM.


175
0:14:27,99 --> 0:14:30,302
THE SPERM ARE PROGRAMMED
TO SEEK THE EGG


176
0:14:30,302 --> 0:14:33,172
BUT SOME OF THEM
TRY TO FERTILIZE


177
0:14:33,172 --> 0:14:35,874
THE FIRST ROUND OBJECT
THEY FIND--


178
0:14:35,874 --> 0:14:44,249
IN THIS CASE,
AN ORDINARY BODY CELL.


179
0:14:44,249 --> 0:14:46,585
STILL, IN SPITE OF THE OBSTACLES


180
0:14:46,585 --> 0:14:48,754
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SPERM


181
0:14:48,754 --> 0:14:51,39
MAKE THEIR WAY
UP THROUGH THE VAGINA


182
0:14:51,39 --> 0:14:54,426
TO THE CERVIX--
THE MOUTH OF THE UTERUS--


183
0:14:54,426 --> 0:15:10,108
WHICH WILL LEAD TO
THE FALLOPIAN TUBES AND THE EGG.


184
0:15:10,108 --> 0:15:13,745
THE CERVIX SECRETES STRANDS
OF A SPECIAL FLUID PROTEIN


185
0:15:13,745 --> 0:15:17,782
CALLED MUCIN.


186
0:15:17,782 --> 0:15:20,853
DURING OVULATION,
IT IS VERY LIQUID


187
0:15:20,853 --> 0:15:30,295
AND EASY FOR THE SPERM
TO SWIM IN.


188
0:15:30,295 --> 0:15:33,832
THE STRANDS OF MUCIN
PROVIDE TINY CHANNELS


189
0:15:33,832 --> 0:15:37,435
LESS THAN 1/100th
OF A MILLIMETER WIDE


190
0:15:37,435 --> 0:15:45,477
DIRECTING THE SPERM
CLOSER TO THEIR OBJECTIVE.


191
0:15:45,477 --> 0:15:49,247
BUT MANY OF THEM NEVER FIND
THE STRANDS OF MUCIN


192
0:15:49,247 --> 0:15:54,118
AND THEY WILL DIE
IN THE VAGINA.


193
0:15:54,118 --> 0:15:56,621
THOSE THAT SURVIVE


194
0:15:56,621 --> 0:16:1,393
WILL SWIM UP THE MUCIN CHANNELS
TOWARD THE UTERUS.


195
0:16:1,393 --> 0:16:5,497
THEY SWIM IN DENSE BUNCHES.


196
0:16:5,497 --> 0:16:8,533
THE OUTER ONES
MAY PROTECT THE INNER ONES


197
0:16:8,533 --> 0:16:17,75
FROM THE WOMAN'S ACIDITY
AND DEFENSE SYSTEMS.


198
0:16:17,75 --> 0:16:19,544
ONCE INSIDE THE CERVIX


199
0:16:19,544 --> 0:16:22,815
THE SPERM CONTINUE
ON THEIR JOURNEY.


200
0:16:22,815 --> 0:16:25,35
SOME REMAIN HERE


201
0:16:25,35 --> 0:16:32,657
PERHAPS TO PROVIDE A BACKUP
FOR THOSE THAT CONTINUE ON.


202
0:16:32,657 --> 0:16:36,595
THE REST PROCEED UP
THROUGH THE CAVITY OF THE UTERUS


203
0:16:36,595 --> 0:16:47,505
IN SEARCH OF THE EGG.


204
0:16:47,505 --> 0:17:1,92
THEIR NUMBER IS
NOTICEABLY REDUCED.


205
0:17:1,92 --> 0:17:4,889
HERE, FROM INSIDE THE UTERUS


206
0:17:4,889 --> 0:17:12,964
WE SEE THE OPENINGS
TO THE TWO FALLOPIAN TUBES.


207
0:17:12,964 --> 0:17:20,138
THE SPERM SWIM TOWARD THEM.


208
0:17:20,138 --> 0:17:24,91
ONE LEADS TO THE WAITING EGG...


209
0:17:24,91 --> 0:17:33,118
THE OTHER TO AN EMPTY TUBE.


210
0:17:33,118 --> 0:17:36,221
ONLY HALF OF THE FEW
REMAINING SPERM


211
0:17:36,221 --> 0:18:0,945
WILL SWIM UP THE TUBE
WHICH HOLDS THE EGG.


212
0:18:0,945 --> 0:18:4,716
THE TUBES ARE LINED
WITH MILLIONS OF TINY CILIA--


213
0:18:4,716 --> 0:18:7,752
THE SAME CILIA WHICH
HELPED DRAW THE EGG


214
0:18:7,752 --> 0:18:11,22
FROM THE OVARY TOWARD THE UTERUS
AT OVULATION.


215
0:18:11,22 --> 0:18:13,325
THESE CILIA SWAY CONSTANTLY


216
0:18:13,325 --> 0:18:16,161
CREATING A GENTLE
DOWNWARD CURRENT


217
0:18:16,161 --> 0:18:29,608
THAT THE SPERM
MUST SWIM AGAINST.


218
0:18:29,608 --> 0:18:31,843
SOME SPERM GET STUCK


219
0:18:31,843 --> 0:18:38,383
IN AMONG THE CELLS
LINING THE WALLS OF THE TUBE.


220
0:18:38,383 --> 0:18:49,94
OTHERS LOSE THEIR
SENSE OF DIRECTION.


221
0:18:49,94 --> 0:18:52,397
DURING THIS PART OF
THE SPERM'S JOURNEY


222
0:18:52,397 --> 0:18:56,701
THE LAYER OF ENZYME INHIBITORS
AT THE TIPS OF THEIR HEADS


223
0:18:56,701 --> 0:19:0,505
IS SLOWLY BEING WORN AWAY.


224
0:19:0,505 --> 0:19:4,676
THE SPERM ARE FULLY CAPACITATED
AND ABLE TO FERTILIZE THE EGG


225
0:19:4,676 --> 0:19:19,957
IF THEY EVER ENCOUNTER IT.


226
0:19:19,957 --> 0:19:25,263
OF THE 200 MILLION SPERM
THAT BEGIN THIS LONG JOURNEY


227
0:19:25,263 --> 0:19:32,971
ONLY ABOUT 50
EVER REACH THE EGG.


228
0:19:32,971 --> 0:19:37,709
THE EGG IS SURROUNDED BY TWO
LAYERS OF THE NUTRITIVE CELLS


229
0:19:37,709 --> 0:19:45,5
WHICH HAVE NOURISHED IT ON ITS
JOURNEY IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE.


230
0:19:45,5 --> 0:19:48,72
THE SPERM IMMEDIATELY RELEASE
THEIR DIGESTIVE ENZYMES


231
0:19:48,72 --> 0:19:52,724
TO BREAK THROUGH THESE
PROTECTIVE NUTRITIVE LAYERS


232
0:19:52,724 --> 0:19:58,163
IN ORDER TO REACH
THE EGG ITSELF.


233
0:19:58,163 --> 0:20:2,267
AT BEST, ONLY ONE
WILL EVENTUALLY ENTER


234
0:20:2,267 --> 0:20:10,375
AND FERTILIZE THE EGG.


235
0:20:10,375 --> 0:20:13,645
THE JOINT FORCE
OF THEIR EXERTIONS


236
0:20:13,645 --> 0:20:16,781
STARTS THE EGG ROLLING AROUND


237
0:20:16,781 --> 0:22:16,781
LIKE A MYSTERIOUS
CELESTIAL BODY.
