###8 Hey Food Tubers! Welcome to the Dumpling Sisters kitchen. Now
###11 Chinese New Year is just around the corner, so we're making some delicious pot stickers.
###16 Pan fried dumplings that look like little nuggets of gold. Legends says that they will
###19 bring good fortune if eaten on New Years Eve. Our pot stickers have a juicy pork filling
###25 and we whip up a fab dipping sauce to go with them too!
###28 So let's get started. First up dumpling wrappers, now these are
###32 so ridiculously easy that you'll never have to buy them from the shop again.
###36 And with 300 grams of flour, goes a good pinch of salt and 220mls of boiling water to bring
###42 it all together. Now this is a neat little trick to stop them
###45 getting too sticky. But do take your time because the dough is scorching hot!
###48 Try getting your chopsticks in there too, think of them as useful tools to get you from
###53 kitchen to dinner table. Now to work on those arm muscles!
###57 knead the dough for about 10 minutes until silky smooth. Now before we let this baby
###62 rest we're going to hcop it into two and then form each into a bagel.
###66 This is our little tip to get all the pot stickers the same size.
###71 Don't try that at home! Now while the dough's resting we're going
###83 to get started on our filling. So here we have some lovely pork shoulder. We're going
###87 to mince it up ourselves even though you can use pork mince. Because that's the way that
###91 Mum taught us and it's always made for a scrumptious filling.
###95 Give it a good bash up with your cleaver, 300 grams of pork shoulder should make 32
###99 dumplings. To tenderise the meat we're just going to
###101 chuck in a little bit of baking soda and corn flour. These two are magic ingredients in
###106 the Chinese kitchen, Baking soda breaks down the tough proteins in meat while the corn
###110 four creates a velvety mouth feel. Salt, sugar and a wee bit of white pepper.
###117 To plump everything up we're just going to chuck in some water, bit of salsing rice wine.
###122 Dark soy, light soy and sesame oil. Then just grab your chopsticks and give it
###133 a good mix. And to make our dumplings a complete meal
###136 we're going to chuck in a wee bit of leafy bok choi as well.
###141 And just to finish it off we're going to chuck in some garlic and ginger and of course as
###147 always spring onion a staple in the Chinese Kitchen.
###151 Mix it up in one direction just to make sure that everything binds together so we get a
###154 lovely bite when we sink our teeth into those dumplings.
###158 Right, these babies are ready to go! Through the middle, line the halves up and
###164 keep dividing until you get 16 pieces. There you have it a little army of identical
###174 dough pieces. Place a piece cut side up, flat onto your palm and we;ll get on with turning
###180 these into dumpling wrappers. Now I'm going to use a rolling pin, the skinnier
###183 the better. If you're right handed that#s where your rolling pin will be, here we go.
###189 Roll, twist with your left hand, roll, twist with your left hand, roll, twist, roll, twist,
###197 roll twist, roll, twist. And just keep going!
###206 Time to get our wrap on. SO start by making a cradle for your hand with the dumping wrapper
###210 then grab some filling and pop it in the middle. Smooth down the top, then fold it over with
###219 your thumb In the middle. Give it a wee pinch at the end before guiding it over and folding
###224 it over with your thumb and index finger. And again, and again, making sure to pinch
###231 as you go along. All the way until the end.
###234 When you're left with a lovely crescent shape! Should we do like ghost?
###244 This is good for date night. Perfect for date night. You mean look longingly into each others
###252 eyes?! Ha!
###253 Put your thumb in there! Get a frying pan with a tight fitting lit
###259 over medium heat and a splash of veg oil. Let's get these bad boys in. Nestle them in
###266 really tight around the pan. Big spoon, little spoon.
###275 When the bottoms are golden like this, pour on water and cover.
###281 While the dumplings are cooking we're going to make out the easiest dipping sauce of all
###286 time. First, sesame oil, then we've got some light
###290 soy sauce, generous with that one. And just to finish off, a nice blob of chilli
###296 oil. So chuck that in. I like that quite spicy. Done.
###301 Ohh yum! Right, these are done when the water's all
###304 gone. Just remember to put those golden bottoms on show.
###306 And if you don't want to miss out on wicked recipes, make sure you subscribe to Food Tube
