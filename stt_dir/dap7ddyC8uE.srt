0:0:23,424 --> 0:0:27,18
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

It's kinky.

Give me two minutes.


89
0:6:28,25 --> 0:6:35,135
Got a light, mate?


90
0:6:35,135 --> 0:6:47,292
Got a spare cig an' all?


91
0:6:47,292 --> 0:6:55,275
You got anywhere to go?

Chesney, thank you, Chesney."


94

Don't expect to lay eyes
on me until the morning.


95
0:7:3,809 --> 0:7:7,39

with a beautiful girl.


96
0:7:7,39 --> 0:7:13,84
Yeah, where is she,
you fucking hound?


97
0:7:13,84 --> 0:7:15,64
I can't see... She must...


98
0:7:15,64 --> 0:7:17,32
No, not the spaz?!


99
0:7:17,32 --> 0:7:21,108
Fuck off! Must have bolted.


100
0:7:21,108 --> 0:7:24,699
Right, I better...


101
0:7:24,699 --> 0:7:26,474
Argh!


102
0:7:26,474 --> 0:8:1,67
Fuck!


103
0:8:1,67 --> 0:8:4,562
D'you want a Viagra? Never go
anywhere without me little bits.


104
0:8:4,562 --> 0:8:6,6
No rush, is there?


105
0:8:6,6 --> 0:8:10,395
You're the boss.


106
0:8:10,395 --> 0:8:16,578
Must be my guilty
Catholic conscience.


107
0:8:16,578 --> 0:8:19,705

I'm an aggressive power bottom.


108
0:8:19,705 --> 0:8:21,289
But I will switch
for the right fella.


109
0:8:21,289 --> 0:8:22,695
Outside.


110
0:8:22,695 --> 0:8:35,2
Now.


111
0:8:35,2 --> 0:9:3,123
Can't we just do it in the...


112
0:9:3,123 --> 0:9:5,72
Hold on in there, mate.
Hold on in there.


113
0:9:5,72 --> 0:9:11,6
You'll be all right.


114
0:9:11,6 --> 0:9:12,72
Oh, shit!


115
0:9:12,72 --> 0:9:29,92
FLATLINE TONE


116
0:9:29,92 --> 0:9:33,48
(LAUGHS EVILLY)


117
0:9:33,48 --> 0:9:35,439
Eww.


118
0:9:35,439 --> 0:9:39,292
D'you always laugh like that?
It's really fucking annoying.


119
0:9:39,292 --> 0:9:42,275
Go on... Die.


120
0:9:42,275 --> 0:9:44,2
It'd be hilarious.


121
0:9:44,2 --> 0:9:47,486
You can't say that, you're...


122
0:9:47,486 --> 0:9:49,738
my guardian...


123
0:9:49,738 --> 0:9:54,408
What have you got to go back to?


124
0:9:54,408 --> 0:9:55,426
My life.


125
0:9:55,426 --> 0:9:57,98
Is that what you'd call it?


126
0:9:57,98 --> 0:10:1,237
Scared of your own shadow
before all this.


127
0:10:1,237 --> 0:10:5,2
What you going to be like now?


128
0:10:5,2 --> 0:10:6,28
I'm not scared.


129
0:10:6,28 --> 0:10:10,89
Grab life with both hands,
did you? Eh?


130
0:10:10,89 --> 0:10:12,197
The little sperm that could?


131
0:10:12,197 --> 0:10:15,222
You've been an apology
for a life. An anti-life.


132
0:10:15,222 --> 0:10:19,0
And I'm your anti-angel.
Say hello to your anti.


133
0:10:19,0 --> 0:10:22,836
(LAUGHS)


134
0:10:22,836 --> 0:10:24,637
Fuck off!


135
0:10:24,637 --> 0:10:25,96
He's opened his eyes.


136
0:10:25,96 --> 0:10:29,403
Thank Jesus, Joseph and Mary,
he's going to be all right.


137
0:10:29,403 --> 0:10:37,76
Might be even better. A bang on
the head, new and improved version.


138
0:10:37,76 --> 0:10:40,365
Who done this to you, Micky?
Who was it, lad?


139
0:10:40,365 --> 0:10:41,784
Just let him get his bearings, Mimi.


140
0:10:41,784 --> 0:10:44,787
- She's upset.
- We're all upset.


141
0:10:44,787 --> 0:10:48,283
What happened mate? One minute you
were there, and the next you just...


142
0:10:48,283 --> 0:10:50,623
Bit of a downer to be honest...


143
0:10:50,623 --> 0:10:52,502
Shaping up to be
a cracking night as well.


144
0:10:52,502 --> 0:10:56,47
I... I can't remember. I can't...


145
0:10:56,47 --> 0:10:57,391
What's up with me?


146
0:10:57,391 --> 0:10:58,76
Concussion. Bruised ribs.


147
0:10:58,76 --> 0:10:59,975
You could be brain damaged.


148
0:10:59,975 --> 0:11:4,63
Don't fucking say it,
I'm warning you!


149
0:11:4,63 --> 0:11:5,402
He's my baby.


150
0:11:5,402 --> 0:11:7,296
They left you for dead, kid.


151
0:11:7,296 --> 0:11:13,4
What the fuck were you doing out
in the middle of nowhere, anyway?


152
0:11:13,4 --> 0:11:15,555
I wish I could remember.


153
0:11:15,555 --> 0:11:17,602
Really.


154
0:11:17,602 --> 0:11:19,493
It's all a bit foggy.


155
0:11:19,493 --> 0:11:40,335
When it does come back,
let us know. We'll take care of it.


156
0:11:40,335 --> 0:11:42,118
I know what you're thinking.


157
0:11:42,118 --> 0:11:43,44
You went to bed with Rihanna


158
0:11:43,44 --> 0:11:47,604
and woke up with
a fat pig from Crumpsall.


159
0:11:47,604 --> 0:11:49,994
I wasn't thinking...
You're not fat.


160
0:11:49,994 --> 0:11:55,8
(LAUGHS) Fuck off, I'm just messing
wi' your head, pal.


161
0:11:55,8 --> 0:11:56,986
I'm only in it for the sex,


162
0:11:56,986 --> 0:12:3,442
and I bagged myself a blond. Score.


163
0:12:3,442 --> 0:12:8,362
Shut the door on your way out, yeah?


164
0:12:8,362 --> 0:12:18,32
I'm in Crumpsall?!


165
0:12:18,32 --> 0:12:22,696
# You keep saying
You've got something for me... #


166
0:12:22,696 --> 0:12:24,172
All right, gorgeous?


167
0:12:24,172 --> 0:12:25,48
Step aside, boys.


168
0:12:25,48 --> 0:12:27,84
Show us your tits
and we'll think about it.


169
0:12:27,84 --> 0:12:29,474
Where you heading? Keep you company.


170
0:12:29,474 --> 0:12:30,553
You think?


171
0:12:30,553 --> 0:12:32,486
I know what I'd do to you.


172
0:12:32,486 --> 0:12:36,569
Show her some respect, lads.


173
0:12:36,569 --> 0:12:42,121
All right.
Let's do it right here, then.


174
0:12:42,121 --> 0:12:44,4
Who's first?


175
0:12:44,4 --> 0:12:46,92
# And that's just what they'll do


176
0:12:46,92 --> 0:12:58,205
# One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk over you


177
0:12:58,205 --> 0:13:31,994
# Start walking... #


178
0:13:31,994 --> 0:13:41,871
Fuck.


179
0:13:41,871 --> 0:13:44,46
There he is. Dirty stop-out.


180
0:13:44,46 --> 0:13:45,293
Fuck off.


181
0:13:45,293 --> 0:13:47,485
So who was it then?
That bird in the wheelie?


182
0:13:47,485 --> 0:13:50,2
Yeah, right(!) I shag cripples,
that's what I'm in to.


183
0:13:50,2 --> 0:13:52,143
Fuck! Patty...
I didn't mean anything by it.


184
0:13:52,143 --> 0:13:55,56
Don't apologise to me.
I hate the moaning bastards.


185
0:13:55,56 --> 0:13:57,345
Don't knock the raspberries.


186
0:13:57,345 --> 0:13:59,375
Some of my best customers
are the paralytics.


187
0:13:59,375 --> 0:14:1,495
How can you hate them,
when you're in that?


188
0:14:1,495 --> 0:14:3,748
I wasn't born like this.
I had an accident,


189
0:14:3,748 --> 0:14:6,0
it's different.
Tragedy befell me.


190
0:14:6,0 --> 0:14:8,145
Anyway, it was a girl
in the taxi queue. Not Clem.


191
0:14:8,145 --> 0:14:11,16
Ooo, Clem, is it?
Comes with her own WD-40.


192
0:14:11,16 --> 0:14:12,72
Looked in the mirror lately?


193
0:14:12,72 --> 0:14:16,167
You're no fucking
oil painting, mate.


194
0:14:16,167 --> 0:14:20,713
It's not the fish. It's me.


195
0:14:20,713 --> 0:14:22,68
- Say it!
- Fuck off.


196
0:14:22,68 --> 0:14:24,36
- Admit it!
- I'll admit I shagged your sister.


197
0:14:24,36 --> 0:14:28,76
- Makes two of us.
- Easy!


198
0:14:28,76 --> 0:14:32,479
PHONE BEEPS


199
0:14:32,479 --> 0:14:34,16
Filth.


200
0:14:34,16 --> 0:14:35,504
(LAUGHS) Look at that!


201
0:14:35,504 --> 0:14:39,455
I never text!


202
0:14:39,455 --> 0:14:47,2
It's... pre-historic.


203
0:14:47,2 --> 0:14:50,54
Nah. Need a clear head.
Got an essay to write later.


204
0:14:50,54 --> 0:14:53,46
Yeah, you run along now, schoolie.


205
0:14:53,46 --> 0:14:56,86
I don't give a shit, but if I don't
submit it then I get detention.


206
0:14:56,86 --> 0:14:59,297
Detention? Who cares?
School's school, innit?


207
0:14:59,297 --> 0:15:0,414
You get a detention,
you get a detention.


208
0:15:0,414 --> 0:15:4,472
Shut up!


209
0:15:4,472 --> 0:15:5,98
What are you at school for anyway?


210
0:15:5,98 --> 0:15:7,2
Dunno.


211
0:15:7,2 --> 0:15:10,9
Work hard so you can
spend your life tied to a desk?


212
0:15:10,9 --> 0:15:12,3
Not me, man.


213
0:15:12,3 --> 0:15:16,1
No. I'm a free spirit.
As soon as I'm 18,


214
0:15:16,1 --> 0:15:18,618
I'm out of here.


215
0:15:18,618 --> 0:15:33,42
Work the cruise ships,
see the world. Med, Caribbean.


216
0:15:33,42 --> 0:15:37,22
# She's a burglar


217
0:15:37,22 --> 0:15:40,2
# She broke in to my mind


218
0:15:40,2 --> 0:15:43,2
# She's a burglar


219
0:15:43,2 --> 0:15:45,98
# She took everything she could find


220
0:15:45,98 --> 0:15:50,18
# She looked into my eyes


221
0:15:50,18 --> 0:15:52,7
# In my front socket


222
0:15:52,7 --> 0:15:56,332
# And just like that
My heart was gone


223
0:15:56,332 --> 0:16:2,769
# She put it in her pocket. #


224
0:16:2,769 --> 0:16:4,863
Mam, I can walk, will you back off?


225
0:16:4,863 --> 0:16:6,18
I'm trying to help you.


226
0:16:6,18 --> 0:16:7,5
You're hurting mi' ribs.


227
0:16:7,5 --> 0:16:11,74
We're all here for you, Micky, love.
I want yous lot to spoil him rotten.


228
0:16:11,74 --> 0:16:14,38
He's had a big shock.
Whatever he wants, we give to him.


229
0:16:14,38 --> 0:16:17,144
That's not ticking, is it?


230
0:16:17,144 --> 0:16:18,66
It smells of strawberries.


231
0:16:18,66 --> 0:16:22,183
Somebody's been
using my washing machine.


232
0:16:22,183 --> 0:16:23,74
Someone's been sat in our chairs.


233
0:16:23,74 --> 0:16:25,38
Someone's been eating my porridge.


234
0:16:25,38 --> 0:16:28,3
All right, breakfast,
it's just breakfast.


235
0:16:28,3 --> 0:16:42,56
Here comes Goldilocks.


236
0:16:42,56 --> 0:16:45,669
Hiya, lads.


237
0:16:45,669 --> 0:16:49,153
Hi, Auntie Mimi.


238
0:16:49,153 --> 0:16:52,138
Thanks for bringing
my case in, boys.


239
0:16:52,138 --> 0:17:6,52
(ALL) Auntie?


240
0:17:6,52 --> 0:17:7,403
Nice gaff.


241
0:17:7,403 --> 0:17:10,333
Relative to what?


242
0:17:10,333 --> 0:17:12,372
I'm sorry.


243
0:17:12,372 --> 0:17:13,38
No sweat.


244
0:17:13,38 --> 0:17:14,82
Seriously, I was out of line.


245
0:17:14,82 --> 0:17:18,317
D'you think you're the first dick
I've met? I'm a big girl.


246
0:17:18,317 --> 0:17:20,647
Fair enough. I deserved that.


247
0:17:20,647 --> 0:17:23,263
You didn't exactly
declare your hand, though, did you?


248
0:17:23,263 --> 0:17:24,607
What?


249
0:17:24,607 --> 0:17:26,26
It never occurred to you
that the chair might come


250
0:17:26,26 --> 0:17:27,5
as a bit of a surprise?


251
0:17:27,5 --> 0:17:29,14
Yeah, that's what I do...


252
0:17:29,14 --> 0:17:31,6
I lure men in with
my able-bodied ruse,


253
0:17:31,6 --> 0:17:33,74
so's they can humiliate
themselves.


254
0:17:33,74 --> 0:17:43,62
That's a good night out for me that.
How I like to spend my time.


255
0:17:43,62 --> 0:17:46,28
I'm not fooled, you know.


256
0:17:46,28 --> 0:17:50,174
You like me.


257
0:17:50,174 --> 0:17:53,258
Right, I'm off.
Nice to see you again, Ruby.


258
0:17:53,258 --> 0:17:55,866
You're looking... all grown up.


259
0:17:55,866 --> 0:17:59,48
Eyes to the front,
roll your tongues back in, lads.


260
0:17:59,48 --> 0:18:5,728
Take care of your brother.


261
0:18:5,728 --> 0:18:7,298
I am really sorry.


262
0:18:7,298 --> 0:18:8,58
That's OK.


263
0:18:8,58 --> 0:18:12,367
God gave you your talents,
and you use them to your advantage.


264
0:18:12,367 --> 0:18:13,969
Just don't take the piss.


265
0:18:13,969 --> 0:18:16,452
I really did need
to use the machine.


266
0:18:16,452 --> 0:18:20,342
My stuff was manky
when I came through the window.


267
0:18:20,342 --> 0:18:23,88
That's what I mean
about taking advantage.


268
0:18:23,88 --> 0:18:28,846
Break into my house again,
I'll have your tits for ash trays.


269
0:18:28,846 --> 0:18:32,907
Understood.


270
0:18:32,907 --> 0:18:34,567
How's your mum, then?


271
0:18:34,567 --> 0:18:36,87
She still hates you.


272
0:18:36,87 --> 0:18:39,339
No change there, then.


273
0:18:39,339 --> 0:18:40,763
Yeah, but why's it illegal?


274
0:18:40,763 --> 0:18:42,764
Fair enough nobody wants
babies with eight fingers


275
0:18:42,764 --> 0:18:46,26
on each hand, but fuck
it if you wear a condom.


276
0:18:46,26 --> 0:18:47,837
She's your first cousin.


277
0:18:47,837 --> 0:18:50,74
We've only got her word for that!


278
0:18:50,74 --> 0:18:52,587
Not seen her in ten years.


279
0:18:52,587 --> 0:18:54,866
You should get a DNA test done.


280
0:18:54,866 --> 0:18:58,264
I mean... it's hard to believe
she's the same species as you lot,


281
0:18:58,264 --> 0:19:15,3
let alone family.


282
0:19:15,3 --> 0:19:20,307
Get to fuck.


283
0:19:20,307 --> 0:19:23,128
OK. A blow job from a cousin.


284
0:19:23,128 --> 0:19:24,935
Now, that has got to be legal.


285
0:19:24,935 --> 0:19:28,384
How they going to test for that?


286
0:19:28,384 --> 0:19:33,753
She ain't my cousin.


287
0:19:33,753 --> 0:19:36,14
But I'm your step-son.


288
0:19:36,14 --> 0:19:40,937
Dad... please, do not shag my cousin.


289
0:19:40,937 --> 0:19:49,189
I'm not scared of you, right?
So why don't you just fuck off?!


290
0:19:49,189 --> 0:19:50,56
Who you talking to?


291
0:19:50,56 --> 0:19:55,14
No-one. I'm just doing
mi' exercises, for my lungs.


292
0:19:55,14 --> 0:20:2,225
Have you gone fucking mental?


293
0:20:2,225 --> 0:20:5,168
There's still lots of places
never been mapped, you know.


294
0:20:5,168 --> 0:20:10,415
Indonesia, Papua New Guinea,
and stuff. Thousands of islands.


295
0:20:10,415 --> 0:20:13,471
Don't you need degrees
for that though?


296
0:20:13,471 --> 0:20:15,5
This is all I need.


297
0:20:15,5 --> 0:20:22,133
Pieces of paper
and diplomas make no difference.


298
0:20:22,133 --> 0:20:23,477
What's she called?


299
0:20:23,477 --> 0:20:24,868
- Who?
- Bird you're looking at.


300
0:20:24,868 --> 0:20:26,49
Who gives a shit about her name?


301
0:20:26,49 --> 0:20:35,243
He only reads it for the articles.


302
0:20:35,243 --> 0:20:37,57
What is it? What's her name?


303
0:20:37,57 --> 0:20:39,78
Read it yourself if it matters
that much to you!


304
0:20:39,78 --> 0:20:41,54
Do I look like a fucking slave?!


305
0:20:41,54 --> 0:20:42,62
Do I?!


306
0:20:42,62 --> 0:20:55,24
No.


307
0:20:55,24 --> 0:20:58,793
Was it a gay thing?


308
0:20:58,793 --> 0:21:0,3
I can say it louder if you like?


309
0:21:0,3 --> 0:21:2,62
It's my own fault.
It was me what went there.


310
0:21:2,62 --> 0:21:8,62
Painted a target
on your head, did you?


311
0:21:8,62 --> 0:21:13,18
I'd help out, but...


312
0:21:13,18 --> 0:21:17,78
I fuck strangers
in alleyways and cars. This...


313
0:21:17,78 --> 0:21:19,58
It's an occupational hazard.


314
0:21:19,58 --> 0:21:21,86
I've fucked strangers
in alleyways and cars.


315
0:21:21,86 --> 0:21:23,58
Never had my head
caved in for my trouble.


316
0:21:23,58 --> 0:21:24,78
It's different.


317
0:21:24,78 --> 0:21:28,14
It shouldn't be.


318
0:21:28,14 --> 0:21:30,3
You can't let this rattle you.


319
0:21:30,3 --> 0:21:33,371
No... clearly.


320
0:21:33,371 --> 0:21:36,121
Need to get out, let no cunt
intimidate you. Be a man.


321
0:21:36,121 --> 0:21:37,66
I am a man.


322
0:21:37,66 --> 0:22:10,414
Well, do it, then.


323
0:22:10,414 --> 0:22:14,14
Oh!


324
0:22:14,14 --> 0:22:17,392
I'm sorry, mate.


325
0:22:17,392 --> 0:22:18,959
Sorry.


326
0:22:18,959 --> 0:22:21,6
Fucking virgin!


327
0:22:21,6 --> 0:22:24,298
He still says it's amnesia.
Ambulance picked him up in Gorton.


328
0:22:24,298 --> 0:22:26,257
- So?
- So who runs Gorton?


329
0:22:26,257 --> 0:22:27,98
Felix Dennehy.


330
0:22:27,98 --> 0:22:29,74
If Felix went for him,


331
0:22:29,74 --> 0:22:32,26
he wouldn't have left the job
half done, would he?


332
0:22:32,26 --> 0:22:35,411
We have to hit somebody.
We can't be seen to do nothing.


333
0:22:35,411 --> 0:22:40,32
Besides... the Dennehys have been
getting a bit previous.


334
0:22:40,32 --> 0:22:41,337
How hard?


335
0:22:41,337 --> 0:22:43,87
Think I might need to
tape it down, lads.


336
0:22:43,87 --> 0:22:48,241
How hard do we hit Big Felix?


337
0:22:48,241 --> 0:22:59,338
Random door in Gorton.
Not important.


338
0:22:59,338 --> 0:23:0,711
All right, Ruby?


339
0:23:0,711 --> 0:23:3,18
Billy.


340
0:23:3,18 --> 0:23:5,754
Uncle Billy.


341
0:23:5,754 --> 0:23:7,565
Step-uncle, if you like.


342
0:23:7,565 --> 0:23:11,592
You going running?
I'm quite fit myself.


343
0:23:11,592 --> 0:23:14,307
That's a fair assessment.


344
0:23:14,307 --> 0:23:16,208
- You know me and Mimi?
- Yeah.


345
0:23:16,208 --> 0:23:17,968
We're quite relaxed about stuff?


346
0:23:17,968 --> 0:23:19,98
Oh.


347
0:23:19,98 --> 0:23:29,492
Well, I will bear that in mind.


348
0:23:29,492 --> 0:23:31,188
Don't shit on your own doorstep,
Billy.


349
0:23:31,188 --> 0:23:41,981
(HE MOUTHS)


350
0:23:41,981 --> 0:23:43,321
Enjoy your detention?


351
0:23:43,321 --> 0:23:44,535
No.


352
0:23:44,535 --> 0:23:46,68
Next time, hand in your homework.


353
0:23:46,68 --> 0:23:48,24
Can I ask you a question, Miss?


354
0:23:48,24 --> 0:23:49,173
Mmm-hmm.


355
0:23:49,173 --> 0:23:53,198
I've got a mate who... can't read.
An adult, well, I mean... older boy.


356
0:23:53,198 --> 0:23:55,861
There are evening classes,
day classes at college too.


357
0:23:55,861 --> 0:23:59,617
He's not really a joiner.
I think he's embarrassed about it.


358
0:23:59,617 --> 0:24:3,725
You're not remotely as dumb as you
try to get away with, are you?


359
0:24:3,725 --> 0:24:7,869
He wants to travel. Work on ships.


360
0:24:7,869 --> 0:24:10,659
Your friend needs to get over
the embarrassment and deal with it,


361
0:24:10,659 --> 0:24:13,17
or his life chances will be limited.


362
0:24:13,17 --> 0:24:17,181
You need qualifications.


363
0:24:17,181 --> 0:24:19,26
Your mate. Frasier Kane.


364
0:24:19,26 --> 0:24:22,992
That boy has more than
just literacy problems, Croker.


365
0:24:22,992 --> 0:24:25,507
Why won't you give anybody a chance?
He's the smartest guy I know.


366
0:24:25,507 --> 0:24:28,613
I seriously doubt that.


367
0:24:28,613 --> 0:24:37,709
Thanks for the advice.


368
0:24:37,709 --> 0:24:39,609
Heaton.


369
0:24:39,609 --> 0:24:42,34
She always were a frustrated cow.


370
0:24:42,34 --> 0:24:49,5
Hated me.


371
0:24:49,5 --> 0:24:50,98
All right, sexy?


372
0:24:50,98 --> 0:24:53,94
# You've got to tease your man... #


373
0:24:53,94 --> 0:24:56,34
WOLF WHISTLE


374
0:24:56,34 --> 0:25:2,69
# You've got to please your man... #


375
0:25:2,69 --> 0:25:5,58
Is that her? Clever Girl.


376
0:25:5,58 --> 0:25:8,42
And the rest. That one'll
never starve, I tell you.


377
0:25:8,42 --> 0:25:10,313
Think she could conquer
the world, that one.


378
0:25:10,313 --> 0:25:11,787
Didn't you at that age?


379
0:25:11,787 --> 0:25:15,413
I was practising blow jobs
on bananas.


380
0:25:15,413 --> 0:25:18,27
I thought it was the best way
to a man's heart.


381
0:25:18,27 --> 0:25:21,61
She's had it hard, the kid.
When our Kenny died


382
0:25:21,61 --> 0:25:24,102
and her ma brought her back
from Australia to Glasgow,


383
0:25:24,102 --> 0:25:26,927
didn't tell a fucking soul.
Cut her off from the family.


384
0:25:26,927 --> 0:25:28,204
Is she Scots then?


385
0:25:28,204 --> 0:25:31,167
Only by misfortune.
Scouse by paternal line.


386
0:25:31,167 --> 0:25:32,479
And what brings her here?


387
0:25:32,479 --> 0:25:48,18
I've asked her half a dozen times,
still haven't got a clue.


388
0:25:48,18 --> 0:25:55,74
Got a light, mate?


389
0:25:55,74 --> 0:25:57,62
Outside.


390
0:25:57,62 --> 0:26:4,122
Now.


391
0:26:4,122 --> 0:26:16,826
You can't let this rattle you.


392
0:26:16,826 --> 0:26:18,186
Can I take that?


393
0:26:18,186 --> 0:26:19,232
You can get a cab closer.


394
0:26:19,232 --> 0:26:21,22
It's got to be this one.


395
0:26:21,22 --> 0:26:25,716
Just for argument's sake, say
you did shag a bird in a wheelie.


396
0:26:25,716 --> 0:26:28,66
In a wheelchair.


397
0:26:28,66 --> 0:26:29,681
Wouldn't it hurt?


398
0:26:29,681 --> 0:26:33,141
Maybe... if you let the brakes off.


399
0:26:33,141 --> 0:26:37,789
Nah, not me, her. I mean,
I'd be scared of breaking something.


400
0:26:37,789 --> 0:26:39,625
Hurting her.


401
0:26:39,625 --> 0:26:41,243
She wouldn't be able
to feel nothing.


402
0:26:41,243 --> 0:26:42,877
Oh, that's a misconception.


403
0:26:42,877 --> 0:26:46,14
In fact, for some of us,
sensation is heightened.


404
0:26:46,14 --> 0:26:54,792
Considerably heightened.


405
0:26:54,792 --> 0:26:57,795
Clem?


406
0:26:57,795 --> 0:27:0,867
Clementine!


407
0:27:0,867 --> 0:27:13,424
Clem!


408
0:27:13,424 --> 0:27:15,543
There's two Rs in sorry.


409
0:27:15,543 --> 0:27:22,79
I'm not a complete idiot.
Weren't enough bricks.


410
0:27:22,79 --> 0:27:27,517
I am. Really.


411
0:27:27,517 --> 0:27:41,58
Wait there.


412
0:27:41,58 --> 0:27:43,58
You robbed those
from someone's garden.


413
0:27:43,58 --> 0:27:47,1
Liberated is the word
you're looking for.


414
0:27:47,1 --> 0:27:48,98
Look, you're forgiven, all right?


415
0:27:48,98 --> 0:27:51,587
Go on about your business
with a clear conscience.


416
0:27:51,587 --> 0:27:55,663
You're not a dick,
just another regular lad.


417
0:27:55,663 --> 0:27:58,6
If I let stuff like that bother me,


418
0:27:58,6 --> 0:28:9,725
I'd really be up shit creek,
wouldn't I?


419
0:28:9,725 --> 0:28:13,94
I don't want to be just another lad.
I want to be your lad.


420
0:28:13,94 --> 0:28:31,42
No means no, Carl.


421
0:28:31,42 --> 0:28:32,747
Am I a man?


422
0:28:32,747 --> 0:28:35,38
Yep. My turn. Am I in a band?


423
0:28:35,38 --> 0:28:36,5
No.


424
0:28:36,5 --> 0:28:37,834
Wayne Rooney.


425
0:28:37,834 --> 0:28:41,22
No way, fuck off!
How did you just guess that?


426
0:28:41,22 --> 0:28:45,356
Because you're a bloke
and I thought like a bloke.


427
0:28:45,356 --> 0:28:47,719
I'm sitting here
with these largely on display,


428
0:28:47,719 --> 0:28:50,543
so I'll assume you're not
thinking about other women.


429
0:28:50,543 --> 0:28:53,662
Which leaves music and football
and you said he wasn't in a band.


430
0:28:53,662 --> 0:28:55,11
Yeah, but... it's still a leap.


431
0:28:55,11 --> 0:28:57,134
You're a Blue, right?


432
0:28:57,134 --> 0:29:1,545
Except you think you're sneaky, so you
tried to double-bluff me and pick a Red.


433
0:29:1,545 --> 0:29:4,1
But if you're going to pick a Red,
you'll pick an ugly one,


434
0:29:4,1 --> 0:29:5,342
cos you hate them that much.


435
0:29:5,342 --> 0:29:6,717
You are good.


436
0:29:6,717 --> 0:29:10,34
And significantly better off
than when I came in.


437
0:29:10,34 --> 0:29:13,654
Thanks.


438
0:29:13,654 --> 0:29:17,327
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You can't use made-up names.


439
0:29:17,327 --> 0:29:18,58
Yeah.


440
0:29:18,58 --> 0:29:20,462
Hiya.


441
0:29:20,462 --> 0:29:24,946
Hey.


442
0:29:24,946 --> 0:29:30,227
Behave yourself.


443
0:29:30,227 --> 0:29:33,74
If you could just retrieve my car
and deliver it to my home...


444
0:29:33,74 --> 0:29:37,62
RUNNING FOOTSTEPS


445
0:29:37,62 --> 0:29:40,537
It's her, intit?


446
0:29:40,537 --> 0:29:43,868
Miss Heaton, detention queen.


447
0:29:43,868 --> 0:29:45,783
Get out of my way.


448
0:29:45,783 --> 0:29:47,133
We're not in school now.


449
0:29:47,133 --> 0:29:48,452
Excuse me.


450
0:29:48,452 --> 0:29:50,462
I don't think so.


451
0:29:50,462 --> 0:29:52,422
You never liked me.


452
0:29:52,422 --> 0:29:56,16
You weren't a very likable boy.
I see not much has changed.


453
0:29:56,16 --> 0:30:1,94
Watch your mouth. You can't hide
behind your desk now, you bitch.


454
0:30:1,94 --> 0:30:9,102
You're not...
You're not a stupid boy.


455
0:30:9,102 --> 0:30:11,844
There are programmes
where you can learn to read.


456
0:30:11,844 --> 0:30:12,86
You can't read?


457
0:30:12,86 --> 0:30:17,712
I'm not a stupid boy! I'm not a boy!


458
0:30:17,712 --> 0:30:19,232
Would you like to see?


459
0:30:19,232 --> 0:30:21,82
Shh!


460
0:30:21,82 --> 0:30:23,665
Stop it.


461
0:30:23,665 --> 0:30:26,54
Let's see how smart you are
with a real man up you.


462
0:30:26,54 --> 0:30:27,861
Get off me!


463
0:30:27,861 --> 0:30:28,93
Frasier!


464
0:30:28,93 --> 0:30:30,398
Boys, help me, please!


465
0:30:30,398 --> 0:30:31,74
Frasier.


466
0:30:31,74 --> 0:30:33,256
Shut the fuck up!


467
0:30:33,256 --> 0:30:34,988
I'll deal with you later.


468
0:30:34,988 --> 0:30:39,5
(SCREAMS)
Shut up! Shut up!


469
0:30:39,5 --> 0:31:3,78
Shh! Shh!


470
0:31:3,78 --> 0:31:7,94
MOBILE PHONE BUTTON TONES


471
0:31:7,94 --> 0:31:10,798
PHONE RINGING


472
0:31:10,798 --> 0:31:12,503
'Black Panther Cabs?'


473
0:31:12,503 --> 0:31:13,877
Yeah. I need a taxi.


474
0:31:13,877 --> 0:31:15,673
'Where's it picking up from,
please?'


475
0:31:15,673 --> 0:31:17,132
Just outside your office.


476
0:31:17,132 --> 0:31:19,531
'All our drivers here
are on their breaks.'


477
0:31:19,531 --> 0:31:22,913
What about the guy
in the black Vectra outside?


478
0:31:22,913 --> 0:31:27,972
'He's not available.'


479
0:31:27,972 --> 0:31:31,931
Right, no worries.
I'll just call another company.


480
0:31:31,931 --> 0:32:10,428
'He'll be right out.'


481
0:32:10,428 --> 0:32:11,803
Where to?


482
0:32:11,803 --> 0:32:30,2
Rusholme.


483
0:32:30,2 --> 0:32:32,18
Lot of rubbish on these streets.


484
0:32:32,18 --> 0:32:35,311
I don't mind the blacks.
They've settled down.


485
0:32:35,311 --> 0:32:38,848
It's the Pakis
I've got a problem with.


486
0:32:38,848 --> 0:32:41,26
Our streets,


487
0:32:41,26 --> 0:32:46,277
our neighbourhoods,
infiltrating us.


488
0:32:46,277 --> 0:32:49,662
Then what?
Semtex in their rucksacks.


489
0:32:49,662 --> 0:32:52,26
That's what this pays for, you know.


490
0:32:52,26 --> 0:32:54,1
Fucking Council Tax.


491
0:32:54,1 --> 0:32:58,78
It all goes on them. Furnished
flats, kitchens, legal appeals.


492
0:32:58,78 --> 0:33:2,54
And don't get me started
on the crack-heads, the whores.


493
0:33:2,54 --> 0:33:5,5
The diseased.


494
0:33:5,5 --> 0:33:10,916
Queers.


495
0:33:10,916 --> 0:33:14,952
Go on then. Do it.


496
0:33:14,952 --> 0:33:18,82
Do it, you cowardly piece of shit.


497
0:33:18,82 --> 0:33:26,365
And if you can't do him,
do yourself.


498
0:33:26,365 --> 0:33:27,725
What's the matter with you?


499
0:33:27,725 --> 0:33:29,26
Stop it!


500
0:33:29,26 --> 0:33:32,78
A lot of rubbish needing swept away,
don't you think?


501
0:33:32,78 --> 0:33:34,38
CRESCENDO OF CAR HORNS


502
0:33:34,38 --> 0:33:35,3
Do it.


503
0:33:35,3 --> 0:34:2,578
Stop here! Please.


504
0:34:2,578 --> 0:34:6,34
You all right?


505
0:34:6,34 --> 0:34:8,28
(YELPS)


506
0:34:8,28 --> 0:34:20,6
(LAUGHS)


507
0:34:20,6 --> 0:34:22,0
A horse enters a pub


508
0:34:22,0 --> 0:34:24,6
and the barman goes,
"What the fuck's wrong with you?"


509
0:34:24,6 --> 0:34:26,374
Mind your own fucking business.


510
0:34:26,374 --> 0:34:29,76
Whoa...


511
0:34:29,76 --> 0:34:32,71
I think you'll find
I was here first.


512
0:34:32,71 --> 0:34:34,1
You invaded my drinking area.


513
0:34:34,1 --> 0:34:36,771
Fundamental principle,
around this stool, right,


514
0:34:36,771 --> 0:34:40,234
this is my personal drinking space.


515
0:34:40,234 --> 0:34:43,3
You've got the rest of the known
universe to be fucking grumpy.


516
0:34:43,3 --> 0:34:45,64
I'm sorry.


517
0:34:45,64 --> 0:34:50,44
I've had a rough couple of days,
you know...


518
0:34:50,44 --> 0:34:55,284
Yes, well...


519
0:34:55,284 --> 0:35:0,39
Well, a problem shared.


520
0:35:0,39 --> 0:35:2,28
I think God's got it in for me.


521
0:35:2,28 --> 0:35:5,214
I can't do right for doing wrong.


522
0:35:5,214 --> 0:35:7,2
How confused are you?


523
0:35:7,2 --> 0:35:9,563
There is no right, there's no wrong.


524
0:35:9,563 --> 0:35:12,648
There is no God. Sorted.


525
0:35:12,648 --> 0:35:15,476
Any gratuities gratefully received.


526
0:35:15,476 --> 0:35:16,888
Maybe.


527
0:35:16,888 --> 0:35:19,36
Know no right, no wrong.


528
0:35:19,36 --> 0:35:21,719
But I'm the one carrying the scars,
aren't I?


529
0:35:21,719 --> 0:35:24,811
It's not accidental, is it?


530
0:35:24,811 --> 0:35:29,64
Was it the good Lord herself who
swung a tire iron at your bonce?


531
0:35:29,64 --> 0:35:30,71
I think not.


532
0:35:30,71 --> 0:35:32,899
You see, I have read
her instruction manual


533
0:35:32,899 --> 0:35:38,0
and one of the very few pearls it
offers us is an eye for an eye.


534
0:35:38,0 --> 0:35:41,62
Fuck all that touchy-feely
New Testament shit,


535
0:35:41,62 --> 0:35:43,648
fucking lentil eater's manifesto.


536
0:35:43,648 --> 0:35:47,54
Someone smites you,
you smite them right back.


537
0:35:47,54 --> 0:35:48,429
What's that going to solve?


538
0:35:48,429 --> 0:35:55,837
Well, if you're standing
up for your people, a lot.


539
0:35:55,837 --> 0:35:59,6
Standing up for my people.


540
0:35:59,6 --> 0:36:3,4
# GEORGE MICHAEL:
FAITH


541
0:36:3,4 --> 0:36:6,0
# Well, I guess it would be nice... #


542
0:36:6,0 --> 0:36:10,8
My people bring artistic pleasure
to millions.


543
0:36:10,8 --> 0:36:12,28
Them the choirs?


544
0:36:12,28 --> 0:36:14,44
Oh, yes.


545
0:36:14,44 --> 0:36:16,48
Can't you tell?


546
0:36:16,48 --> 0:36:19,24
# ..before I give my heart away


547
0:36:19,24 --> 0:36:23,347
# And I know all the games you play,
because I play them too


548
0:36:23,347 --> 0:36:25,881
# Cos I gotta have faith,


549
0:36:25,881 --> 0:36:28,0
# I gotta have faith


550
0:36:28,0 --> 0:36:30,64
# Because I've got to have faith


551
0:36:30,64 --> 0:36:57,41
# I've got to have faith, faith,
faith... #


552
0:36:57,41 --> 0:37:2,16
Where the fuck have you been?


553
0:37:2,16 --> 0:37:3,68
Have you got something to say to me?


554
0:37:3,68 --> 0:37:5,8
No.


555
0:37:5,8 --> 0:37:11,483
Well, get with the programme then,
champ.


556
0:37:11,483 --> 0:37:14,64
I'm not going to
be around for a while.


557
0:37:14,64 --> 0:37:18,177
DISTANT POLICE SIREN


558
0:37:18,177 --> 0:37:19,365
Where are you going?


559
0:37:19,365 --> 0:37:20,635
Let him go.


560
0:37:20,635 --> 0:37:30,115
Aidan, you'd better not talk
to anybody.


561
0:37:30,115 --> 0:37:32,384
If you've got it,
flaunt it, fair enough.


562
0:37:32,384 --> 0:37:34,392
But be responsible with it.


563
0:37:34,392 --> 0:37:36,12
I am responsible.


564
0:37:36,12 --> 0:37:38,837
I was young once myself, you know.


565
0:37:38,837 --> 0:37:42,4
Men might button up the back,
but I don't.


566
0:37:42,4 --> 0:37:47,732
Why are you here, kid?
And no bullshit.


567
0:37:47,732 --> 0:37:49,4
My ma threw me out.


568
0:37:49,4 --> 0:37:51,0
If I call her, she'll confirm that?


569
0:37:51,0 --> 0:37:52,44
I thought you couldn't stand her.


570
0:37:52,44 --> 0:37:55,6
I hope she dies a long, slow
death. I'll still call her though.


571
0:37:55,6 --> 0:37:57,676
I'll get my stuff.


572
0:37:57,676 --> 0:38:0,76
Don't be stupid.
You can stay as long as you like.


573
0:38:0,76 --> 0:38:5,44
I owe that to your dad at least,
God rest his soul.


574
0:38:5,44 --> 0:38:7,421
Your business is your business.


575
0:38:7,421 --> 0:38:14,329
And I won't ask again.


576
0:38:14,329 --> 0:38:17,232
Don't seduce all the lads
at one time though, eh?


577
0:38:17,232 --> 0:38:19,246
(LAUGHS)


578
0:38:19,246 --> 0:38:21,552
# Come on, baby... #


579
0:38:21,552 --> 0:38:23,64
Look at this shit!


580
0:38:23,64 --> 0:38:26,28
# You're going to like it
once you get a taste


581
0:38:26,28 --> 0:38:29,36
# I got a feeling in my heart


582
0:38:29,36 --> 0:38:32,48
# Something good is about to start.


583
0:38:32,48 --> 0:38:35,52
# That's a hot dog, hot dog


584
0:38:35,52 --> 0:38:39,44
# Watch me eat a hot dog


585
0:38:39,44 --> 0:38:41,64
# Hot dog, hot dog


586
0:38:41,64 --> 0:38:45,6
# Come on, let's do the hot dog. #


587
0:38:45,6 --> 0:38:52,56
# E-A-T H-O-T D-O-G, Hot dog. #


588
0:38:52,56 --> 0:38:58,442
What is it you want from me, Carl?


589
0:38:58,442 --> 0:39:0,267
I don't know.


590
0:39:0,267 --> 0:39:3,541
You're stalking a girl...
dressed like a dog,


591
0:39:3,541 --> 0:39:7,101
and you don't know what you want?


592
0:39:7,101 --> 0:39:10,55
Not exactly a man with a plan,
are you?


593
0:39:10,55 --> 0:39:12,372
I want to be with you.


594
0:39:12,372 --> 0:39:14,528
After one conversation in a club?


595
0:39:14,528 --> 0:39:24,674
They say it can
happen at first sight.


596
0:39:24,674 --> 0:39:28,977
Shall I tell you what I think?


597
0:39:28,977 --> 0:39:34,761
I want to strap you on to me
and fuck you till my eyes water.


598
0:39:34,761 --> 0:39:52,76
Take the costume off first?


599
0:39:52,76 --> 0:39:55,36
# FLORENCE AND THE MACHINE
Dog Days


600
0:39:55,36 --> 0:39:58,44
# Happiness... hit her


601
0:39:58,44 --> 0:40:7,88
# Like a train on a tra-a-ack


602
0:40:7,88 --> 0:40:11,76
# Coming towards her


603
0:40:11,76 --> 0:40:19,989
# Stuck still no turning ba-ck


604
0:40:19,989 --> 0:40:22,76
# She hid around corners


605
0:40:22,76 --> 0:40:26,16
# And she hid under beds


606
0:40:26,16 --> 0:40:29,24
# She killed it with kisses


607
0:40:29,24 --> 0:40:32,476
# And from it she fled


608
0:40:32,476 --> 0:40:36,8
# The dog days are over


609
0:40:36,8 --> 0:40:38,937
# The dog days are done


610
0:40:38,937 --> 0:40:41,64
# The horses are comin'


611
0:40:41,64 --> 0:40:45,4
# So you better run


612
0:40:45,4 --> 0:40:48,8
# Run fast for your mother
run fast for your father


613
0:40:48,8 --> 0:40:52,12
# Run for your children
for your sisters and brothers


614
0:40:52,12 --> 0:40:54,92
# Leave all your love
and your longing behind


615
0:40:54,92 --> 0:40:58,44
# You can't carry it with you
if you want to survive


616
0:40:58,44 --> 0:41:1,68
# The dog days are over


617
0:41:1,68 --> 0:41:5,2
# The dog days are done


618
0:41:5,2 --> 0:41:7,76
# Can you hear the horses


619
0:41:7,76 --> 0:41:17,678
# Cos here they come


620
0:41:17,678 --> 0:41:21,149
# Happiness
Hit her


621
0:41:21,149 --> 0:41:30,28
# Like a bullet in the ba-a-ck


622
0:41:30,28 --> 0:41:34,318
# Struck from a great height


623
0:41:34,318 --> 0:41:42,12
# By someone who should have known
better than that


624
0:41:42,12 --> 0:41:45,28
# The dog days are over


625
0:41:45,28 --> 0:41:48,92
# The dog days are done


626
0:41:48,92 --> 0:41:51,936
# Can you hear the horses


627
0:41:51,936 --> 0:41:56,16
# Cos here they come... #


628
0:41:56,16 --> 0:41:58,12
Whoa! What the fuck are you doing?


629
0:41:58,12 --> 0:42:1,741
Give me one good reason why
I shouldn't slice your head off


630
0:42:1,741 --> 0:42:6,28
and kick it down the street.


631
0:42:6,28 --> 0:42:7,76
How did you find me?


632
0:42:7,76 --> 0:42:9,685
I was in your cab.


633
0:42:9,685 --> 0:42:11,724
A lot of rubbish needs swept away.


634
0:42:11,724 --> 0:42:16,522
I thought I recognised you.
No wonder my arse tightened.


635
0:42:16,522 --> 0:42:19,41
Maybe I should just chop that off.


636
0:42:19,41 --> 0:42:22,881
I bet it's shrivelled up
like a walnut whip now, ain't it?


637
0:42:22,881 --> 0:42:25,4
- Show me.
- Fuck off.


638
0:42:25,4 --> 0:42:27,159
Get it out.
You bring your filth in here!


639
0:42:27,159 --> 0:42:48,72
Do it!


640
0:42:48,72 --> 0:42:59,685
On your knees, bitch.


641
0:42:59,685 --> 0:43:2,4
It's not nice, is it?


642
0:43:2,4 --> 0:43:5,223
Everything you know stripped away.


643
0:43:5,223 --> 0:43:8,73
All coming to get you, are we?


644
0:43:8,73 --> 0:43:13,16
Blacks, Pakis, queers!


645
0:43:13,16 --> 0:43:18,746
Anyone who's not you, is that it?


646
0:43:18,746 --> 0:43:21,637
What's your little baby going to
think of that when it arrives?


647
0:43:21,637 --> 0:43:36,223
Don't you talk about my baby.


648
0:43:36,223 --> 0:43:39,652
I really hope you do get a boy.


649
0:43:39,652 --> 0:43:42,6
And I hope it's a faggot.


650
0:43:42,6 --> 0:43:45,52
That way you'll have a lot of cocks
to worry about, not just one.


651
0:43:45,52 --> 0:43:56,72
Please.


652
0:43:56,72 --> 0:44:39,417
Looks like you picked on
the wrong guy.


653
0:44:39,417 --> 0:44:41,979
(FRANK) 'You can go through life
being a cliche,


654
0:44:41,979 --> 0:44:45,4
'doing everything
that's expected of you,


655
0:44:45,4 --> 0:44:48,92
'nose to the grindstone,
live to work, work to live,


656
0:44:48,92 --> 0:44:53,98
'but fuck that, break away
and dance to a different beat.


657
0:44:53,98 --> 0:44:55,819
'Ring the changes and just...


658
0:44:55,819 --> 0:44:57,46
'Live.


659
0:44:57,46 --> 0:45:0,296
'Learn to stand proud,
head held high.


660
0:45:0,296 --> 0:45:2,639
'Fuck your detractors,
what do they know?'


661
0:45:2,639 --> 0:45:4,92
Got a light, mate?


662
0:45:4,92 --> 0:45:7,588
'There's no angels, good or bad.'


663
0:45:7,588 --> 0:45:9,125
Got a spare cig an' all?


664
0:45:9,125 --> 0:45:11,962
'There's only you.


665
0:45:11,962 --> 0:45:17,306
'So be proud and fuck the rest.


666
0:45:17,306 --> 0:45:23,26
'That should be enough.'


667
0:45:23,26 --> 0:45:25,108
So why ain't they been yet,
the police?


668
0:45:25,108 --> 0:45:26,904
He knows who we are.


669
0:45:26,904 --> 0:45:28,406
Did you like it?


670
0:45:28,406 --> 0:45:30,451
I thought you wear a wanted man
this side of Manchester.


671
0:45:30,451 --> 0:45:32,631
Maybe he's just checking up.


672
0:45:32,631 --> 0:45:34,381
He doesn't make social calls.


673
0:45:34,381 --> 0:45:35,501
He's a dangerous man.


674
0:45:35,501 --> 0:45:37,518
I don't appreciate a veto on
who I can serve.


675
0:45:37,518 --> 0:45:39,197
You don't have to do this.


676
0:45:39,197 --> 0:45:41,46
What choice is there? How bad do you
want it? I want him dead.


677
0:45:41,46 --> 0:45:42,804
Still got it in you?


678
0:45:42,804 --> 0:45:44,822
I don't care what happens,
I'll be your witness.


679
0:45:44,822 --> 0:45:46,887
It's not normal weed. What is it?


680
0:45:46,887 --> 0:45:48,534
Some herbal shit.


681
0:45:48,534 --> 0:45:50,902
I think I can solve
something over here.


682
0:45:50,902 --> 0:46:33,675

683
0:46:33,675 --> 0:46:55,323
OK, empty your pockets.


684
0:46:55,323 --> 0:46:56,85
Oh...


685
0:46:56,85 --> 0:48:56,85
They... must be mine.
