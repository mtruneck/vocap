0:0:6,709 --> 0:0:7,744
Hi.


2
0:0:7,744 --> 0:0:9,779
What's wrong with your neck?


3
0:0:9,779 --> 0:0:12,181
- It's just a little stuff
from our workout last night.


4
0:0:12,181 --> 0:0:14,717
- What were you doing?
- Incline crunches.


5
0:0:14,717 --> 0:0:15,818
Where were you, anyway?


6
0:0:15,818 --> 0:0:18,354
- On the treadmill,
where you left me.


7
0:0:18,354 --> 0:0:19,922
- I didn't leave you.


8
0:0:19,922 --> 0:0:21,858
You say that every time
we go to the gym.


9
0:0:21,858 --> 0:0:24,427
- Well, I say that,
because whenever we're there,


10
0:0:24,427 --> 0:0:25,928
We're never together.


11
0:0:25,928 --> 0:0:27,96
I used to work out with you.


12
0:0:27,96 --> 0:0:29,65
Now I just work out
at the same gym.


13
0:0:29,65 --> 0:0:30,967
- Look, we go together.


14
0:0:30,967 --> 0:0:33,2
We leave together.
That's together.


15
0:0:33,2 --> 0:0:34,604
We go to movies.
We watch tv.


16
0:0:34,604 --> 0:0:35,938
We surf the web.


17
0:0:35,938 --> 0:0:38,241
Remember that "David goes
to the dentist" video?


18
0:0:38,241 --> 0:0:40,243
That was funny.


19
0:0:40,243 --> 0:0:41,811
- Nick, that's not what I mean.


20
0:0:41,811 --> 0:0:43,78
I want to do something
together-together,


21
0:0:43,78 --> 0:0:45,715
Meaning if you're not doing
a part of it,


22
0:0:45,715 --> 0:0:47,5
And I'm not doing
the other part,


23
0:0:47,5 --> 0:0:48,151
It can't be done.


24
0:0:48,151 --> 0:0:49,519
- Well,
we can do that upstairs.


25
0:0:49,519 --> 0:0:50,52
- Nick.


26
0:0:50,52 --> 0:0:51,954
- Look, the problem is,


27
0:0:51,954 --> 0:0:54,957
I'm the one always
planning stuff for us to do.


28
0:0:54,957 --> 0:0:58,27
- Okay, that is not true.


29
0:0:58,27 --> 0:1:1,13
- Yes, it is, all right?


30
0:1:1,13 --> 0:1:4,67
Look, whenever I ask you
what it is you want to do,


31
0:1:4,67 --> 0:1:6,35
You say, "I don't know.


32
0:1:6,35 --> 0:1:7,737
I want to do
whatever you want to do."


33
0:1:7,737 --> 0:1:9,939
And then I say, "I want
to do something you want to do."


34
0:1:9,939 --> 0:1:11,107
And then you say, "good.


35
0:1:11,107 --> 0:1:12,909
Whatever you decide
is what I want to do."


36
0:1:12,909 --> 0:1:15,178
- Well, I do,
unless I don't want to do it,


37
0:1:15,178 --> 0:1:16,579
Which I don't know
until I do it.


38
0:1:16,579 --> 0:1:20,717
- Fine, I'll tell you what,
you want to do something?


39
0:1:20,717 --> 0:1:23,219
You decide what it is,
and I'll do it.


40
0:1:23,219 --> 0:1:24,754
- Really?
- Really.


41
0:1:24,754 --> 0:1:26,889
And when you come up
with something,


42
0:1:26,889 --> 0:1:27,924
Just let me know.


43
0:1:27,924 --> 0:1:29,559
Can I ask you one favor?


44
0:1:29,559 --> 0:1:30,893
- Yes.


45
0:1:30,893 --> 0:1:33,29
- After we do what you want
to do together,


46
0:1:33,29 --> 0:1:35,98
Can we do what I want
to do together?


47
0:1:35,98 --> 0:1:37,9
- Slow your roll, crook neck.


48
0:1:37,9 --> 0:1:40,97
Let's worry about me first,
and then we'll worry about you.


49
0:1:40,97 --> 0:1:44,373
- Mmm-Mmm, yes, indeed.


50
0:1:44,373 --> 0:1:53,483
Ow.

52
0:1:57,553 --> 0:1:59,922
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.


53
0:1:59,922 --> 0:2:1,39
- I didn't know
you were already here.


54
0:2:1,39 --> 0:2:2,725
I've been calling your cell.


55
0:2:2,725 --> 0:2:4,26
- Yeah, I came in early.


56
0:2:4,26 --> 0:2:6,729
I'm trying to find something fun
for Nick and I to do together.


57
0:2:6,729 --> 0:2:10,433
- Oh, what you looking at?


58
0:2:10,433 --> 0:2:11,701
- Pottery making?


59
0:2:11,701 --> 0:2:13,603
Seriously?


60
0:2:13,603 --> 0:2:15,671
- Do you have a better idea?


61
0:2:15,671 --> 0:2:18,207
I'm trying not to pick
the same old boring stuff.


62
0:2:18,207 --> 0:2:20,276
- Well, if you're looking for
the new boring stuff,


63
0:2:20,276 --> 0:2:21,677
You found it.


64
0:2:21,677 --> 0:2:24,68
- Okay, Nick said that he'll do
whatever I want him to do.


65
0:2:24,68 --> 0:2:25,982
It's on me.


66
0:2:25,982 --> 0:2:30,753
Oooh, now, this looks fun,
and it does not look boring.


67
0:2:30,753 --> 0:2:32,155
- Salsa dancing.


68
0:2:32,155 --> 0:2:34,323
- Yeah, I love salsa.


69
0:2:34,323 --> 0:2:37,493
It's so sexy,
the moves, the clothes.


70
0:2:37,493 --> 0:2:40,663
- Yeah, well,
have fun with that.


71
0:2:40,663 --> 0:2:42,832
- Okay,
what's wrong with salsa dancing?


72
0:2:42,832 --> 0:2:43,866
- Nothing is wrong with it.


73
0:2:43,866 --> 0:2:46,402
I used to love it,
until the accident.


74
0:2:46,402 --> 0:2:47,537
- What?


75
0:2:47,537 --> 0:2:50,74
Gigi, you didn't tell me
about any accident.


76
0:2:50,74 --> 0:2:52,742
- It happened
about three years ago


77
0:2:52,742 --> 0:2:54,544
When I met Jesus.


78
0:2:54,544 --> 0:2:57,814
He would dip me,
spin me around,


79
0:2:57,814 --> 0:2:59,248
Flip me over his back.


80
0:2:59,248 --> 0:3:1,83
Oh, it was incredible.


81
0:3:1,83 --> 0:3:5,288
And he was sexy and confident
and in control


82
0:3:5,288 --> 0:3:7,924
And just amazing.


83
0:3:7,924 --> 0:3:12,161
And that accent, ooooh.


84
0:3:12,161 --> 0:3:13,496
- Do you need some time alone?


85
0:3:13,496 --> 0:3:15,932
- No.
- Okay, so the accident?


86
0:3:15,932 --> 0:3:17,8
- Right, I was hooked.
- Mm-Hmm.


87
0:3:17,8 --> 0:3:20,69
- And then I made
the fatal mistake


88
0:3:20,69 --> 0:3:23,773
Of moving the relationship
out of the studio


89
0:3:23,773 --> 0:3:25,7
And into the street.


90
0:3:25,7 --> 0:3:26,943
You dated him.


91
0:3:26,943 --> 0:3:28,444
- Yes, it was a disaster.


92
0:3:28,444 --> 0:3:29,979
It didn't even last a week.


93
0:3:29,979 --> 0:3:32,381
I mean, in the studio,
he was the sexiest man alive,


94
0:3:32,381 --> 0:3:34,383
But on the street,
he was broke.


95
0:3:34,383 --> 0:3:36,18
I mean,
he lived in a studio apartment,


96
0:3:36,18 --> 0:3:37,954
Wore the same pair of jeans
every day,


97
0:3:37,954 --> 0:3:40,89
And when we went out to eat,
he wanted me to pay.


98
0:3:40,89 --> 0:3:41,591
And he drove a car.


99
0:3:41,591 --> 0:3:43,593
It was horrible.


100
0:3:43,593 --> 0:3:46,229
I mean,
I can't remember the name of it.


101
0:3:46,229 --> 0:3:47,43
It started with a "u."


102
0:3:47,43 --> 0:3:48,598
- A "u"?
- Yeah.


103
0:3:48,598 --> 0:3:50,32
- What kind of car
starts with a "u"?


104
0:3:50,32 --> 0:3:52,1
- Used.
It was used.


105
0:3:52,1 --> 0:3:55,504
- Okay, I love you,
but you have to be stopped.


106
0:3:55,504 --> 0:3:57,39
- Well,
that will never happen again.


107
0:3:57,39 --> 0:3:58,74
Do they have a word for people


108
0:3:58,74 --> 0:3:59,475
Who are afraid
of poor Latin men?


109
0:3:59,475 --> 0:4:1,577
- Yeah, Republicans.


110
0:4:1,577 --> 0:4:2,979
- You know what?


111
0:4:2,979 --> 0:4:4,313
I know one thing.


112
0:4:4,313 --> 0:4:8,885
When I stare into
a Latin man's eyes, I'm done.


113
0:4:8,885 --> 0:4:11,654
- Okay, I have an idea.
- What?


114
0:4:11,654 --> 0:4:12,922
- You should come with us.


115
0:4:12,922 --> 0:4:14,423
- And why would I do that?


116
0:4:14,423 --> 0:4:17,59
- Because you have a crazy,
irrational fear,


117
0:4:17,59 --> 0:4:18,194
And you have to face it.


118
0:4:18,194 --> 0:4:24,6
Now, come here.
Come on.


119
0:4:24,6 --> 0:4:28,738
- okay, I'll go.


120
0:4:28,738 --> 0:4:35,711
But when I fall,
you better be there to catch me.


121
0:4:35,711 --> 0:4:39,615
- Mom, look at these boots.


122
0:4:39,615 --> 0:4:43,653
- Ohhh, those are so cute.


123
0:4:43,653 --> 0:4:44,62
No.


124
0:4:44,62 --> 0:4:45,955
- What?
- No.


125
0:4:45,955 --> 0:4:47,256
- I'll pay you back.


126
0:4:47,256 --> 0:4:48,958
- I'll tell you what,


127
0:4:48,958 --> 0:4:51,794
Save the money you were
gonna use to pay me back,


128
0:4:51,794 --> 0:4:59,635
Then buy the boots.


129
0:4:59,635 --> 0:5:0,937
- What do you want?


130
0:5:0,937 --> 0:5:2,405
- Who says I want anything?


131
0:5:2,405 --> 0:5:4,106
I'm here to give you something.


132
0:5:4,106 --> 0:5:6,242
- And what might that be?


133
0:5:6,242 --> 0:5:7,41
- Advice.


134
0:5:7,41 --> 0:5:9,145
Now, listen,
I've been watching you,


135
0:5:9,145 --> 0:5:11,13
And I hate to tell you,
but you're never gonna get


136
0:5:11,13 --> 0:5:12,748
What you want
if you keep asking like that.


137
0:5:12,748 --> 0:5:14,83
- Really, genius?


138
0:5:14,83 --> 0:5:15,618
What would you
have done differently?


139
0:5:15,618 --> 0:5:17,86
- Okay,
let me put it like this.


140
0:5:17,86 --> 0:5:19,422
The key to getting what you want
is making the person believe


141
0:5:19,422 --> 0:5:20,99
It was their idea
to give it to you.


142
0:5:20,99 --> 0:5:23,326
I call it the bait and switch.


143
0:5:23,326 --> 0:5:24,327
- What?


144
0:5:24,327 --> 0:5:25,494
- Bait and switch.


145
0:5:25,494 --> 0:5:26,862
It's simple.


146
0:5:26,862 --> 0:5:28,931
Just ask for something
The bait.


147
0:5:28,931 --> 0:5:33,402
And en go for something
The switch.


148
0:5:33,402 --> 0:5:38,14
Ha, watch and learn.


149
0:5:38,14 --> 0:5:39,508
Hey, dad.


150
0:5:39,508 --> 0:5:40,977
- What up, party people?


151
0:5:40,977 --> 0:5:43,212
- Hey, dad, the mariners
are playing this weekend.


152
0:5:43,212 --> 0:5:44,914
- I thought you didn't care
about baseball.


153
0:5:44,914 --> 0:5:47,416
- I saw a game on tv, and it
turned out to be kind of cool.


154
0:5:47,416 --> 0:5:49,885
You think we can go?


155
0:5:49,885 --> 0:5:51,22
- I'll see what I can do.


156
0:5:51,22 --> 0:5:54,123
- Yes.
- All right.


157
0:5:54,123 --> 0:5:55,491
- So what.


158
0:5:55,491 --> 0:5:57,593
You asked for tickets,
and you didn't even get them.


159
0:5:57,593 --> 0:5:58,661
- That's not the point.


160
0:5:58,661 --> 0:6:0,29
I didn't want them.


161
0:6:0,29 --> 0:6:2,365
Okay, is there anything else
you want besides those boots?


162
0:6:2,365 --> 0:6:5,167
- Well, there is this watch
I really like.


163
0:6:5,167 --> 0:6:6,502
- Okay, so here's the deal.


164
0:6:6,502 --> 0:6:9,505
The next time dad asks you
to be somewhere, you be late.


165
0:6:9,505 --> 0:6:11,24
- What? That doesn't even make
any sense.


166
0:6:11,24 --> 0:6:13,175
- Shh.


167
0:6:13,175 --> 0:6:14,71
You'll find out soon enough.


168
0:6:14,71 --> 0:6:19,682
- Get your finger off my face.


169
0:6:19,682 --> 0:6:24,32
- Nick, baby, I found something
for us to do together.


170
0:6:24,32 --> 0:6:26,55
- What is it?


171
0:6:26,55 --> 0:6:28,24
- Salsa.


172
0:6:28,24 --> 0:6:31,193
- Ooh, that is nice.


173
0:6:31,193 --> 0:6:32,428
- So what do you think?


174
0:6:32,428 --> 0:6:33,529
- About what?


175
0:6:33,529 --> 0:6:36,565
- Salsa.


176
0:6:36,565 --> 0:6:38,0
- The dance or the sauce?


177
0:6:38,0 --> 0:6:39,535
- The dance.


178
0:6:39,535 --> 0:6:42,238
Nick, I want to take
salsa lessons together.


179
0:6:42,238 --> 0:6:43,706
- Dance class?


180
0:6:43,706 --> 0:6:46,375
- You said you were down
for whatever.


181
0:6:46,375 --> 0:6:47,91
You don't want to do this?


182
0:6:47,91 --> 0:6:49,345
- No, it's cool.


183
0:6:49,345 --> 0:6:51,547
It's just that I don't need
to take dance lessons.


184
0:6:51,547 --> 0:6:53,382
I can dance.


185
0:6:53,382 --> 0:6:56,452
- Baby,
although you do the robot


186
0:6:56,452 --> 0:7:0,189
Better than any man or robot
that I've ever known,


187
0:7:0,189 --> 0:7:2,958
I don't want to be doing that
with you when I'm 50, okay?


188
0:7:2,958 --> 0:7:6,362
Now, salsa, on the other hand,
it's classy, it's grown-up,


189
0:7:6,362 --> 0:7:9,598
And I get to look like this
when we do it.


190
0:7:9,598 --> 0:7:13,769
- Ohh, okay, okay,
we'll go salsa dancing.


191
0:7:13,769 --> 0:7:15,137
But can I ask you a favor?


192
0:7:15,137 --> 0:7:16,372
- Yeah, what?


193
0:7:16,372 --> 0:7:23,746
- When you go in there,
please don't do that.


194
0:7:23,746 --> 0:7:25,114
- Mean.


195
0:7:25,114 --> 0:7:31,77
- It looks like
you're stomping grapes, babe.


196
0:7:31,77 --> 0:7:33,839
- Why do women
love taking classes,


197
0:7:33,839 --> 0:7:36,308
Cooking classes,
painting classes,


198
0:7:36,308 --> 0:7:37,343
Exercise classes?


199
0:7:37,343 --> 0:7:38,744
- Look, it's salsa.


200
0:7:38,744 --> 0:7:40,79
It will be fun.


201
0:7:40,79 --> 0:7:42,948
- Look, all I'm saying is,
why do I have to take salsa?


202
0:7:42,948 --> 0:7:44,884
I mean,
it's not like I'm going to Cuba.


203
0:7:44,884 --> 0:7:46,318
- Duh.


204
0:7:46,318 --> 0:7:47,653
You're not going for the dance.


205
0:7:47,653 --> 0:7:49,88
You're going for the women.


206
0:7:49,88 --> 0:7:50,689
- I'm married.


207
0:7:50,689 --> 0:7:52,791
- Do this,
and you will stay married.


208
0:7:52,791 --> 0:7:54,126
In my years of experience,


209
0:7:54,126 --> 0:7:56,595
I have found there is nothing
sexier than a Latin woman.


210
0:7:56,595 --> 0:7:58,597
And if you can get your woman
to bring out


211
0:7:58,597 --> 0:8:2,968
Her innermost sexy latina,
you will be a very happy man,


212
0:8:2,968 --> 0:8:4,637
Exhausted but happy.


213
0:8:4,637 --> 0:8:8,674
- So Latin women are sexy,
but they're not the only one.


214
0:8:8,674 --> 0:8:10,509
Look, they may be annoying,


215
0:8:10,509 --> 0:8:13,479
But the Kardashians
are sexy...Mostly.


216
0:8:13,479 --> 0:8:15,281
- No, they're Armenian.


217
0:8:15,281 --> 0:8:17,16
Do you know what Armenians
are known for?


218
0:8:17,16 --> 0:8:18,217
Excessive body hair.


219
0:8:18,217 --> 0:8:19,718
You know what latinas
are known for?


220
0:8:19,718 --> 0:8:21,921
Creative ways of ripping it out.


221
0:8:21,921 --> 0:8:23,889
Trust me, you want to do this.


222
0:8:23,889 --> 0:8:25,19
- You're serious.


223
0:8:25,19 --> 0:8:26,425
- I am.


224
0:8:26,425 --> 0:8:27,626
Can I come?


225
0:8:27,626 --> 0:8:29,495
- I can't believe
you just invited yourself


226
0:8:29,495 --> 0:8:30,663
To my salsa class.


227
0:8:30,663 --> 0:8:31,797
- Yeah, it's weird.


228
0:8:31,797 --> 0:8:33,399
It was like
I was trying to convince you,


229
0:8:33,399 --> 0:8:38,704
And I ended up somehow
convincing myself.


230
0:8:38,704 --> 0:8:41,173
- Lindsey, you are late.


231
0:8:41,173 --> 0:8:43,342
You were supposed to be
home early to stay with Kevin.


232
0:8:43,342 --> 0:8:44,81
- Yeah, I know, at 5:15.


233
0:8:44,81 --> 0:8:46,312
- No, it's 6:00.


234
0:8:46,312 --> 0:8:48,847
- Oh, it's my cheap watch.


235
0:8:48,847 --> 0:8:51,65
It goes in and out, so it
doesn't keep the time anymore.


236
0:8:51,65 --> 0:8:53,252
It's all raggedy and tired.


237
0:8:53,252 --> 0:8:54,853
- Well,
you need to get a new watch.


238
0:8:54,853 --> 0:8:55,854
- You think so?


239
0:8:55,854 --> 0:8:57,323
- Yeah, I think so.


240
0:8:57,323 --> 0:8:59,491
Look,
you need to be places on time.


241
0:8:59,491 --> 0:9:0,926
You need a decent watch.


242
0:9:0,926 --> 0:9:2,661
- What about this one?


243
0:9:2,661 --> 0:9:4,196
I mean,
I know it's kind of expensive,


244
0:9:4,196 --> 0:9:5,864
But I hear it's really good.


245
0:9:5,864 --> 0:9:8,0
- $300?


246
0:9:8,0 --> 0:9:10,703
What, you need a new watch so
you can be on time for your job?


247
0:9:10,703 --> 0:9:13,706
You need to find
something cheaper than that.


248
0:9:13,706 --> 0:9:14,974
- What about this one?


249
0:9:14,974 --> 0:9:16,976
It's not as nice, but it's got
some extra bands


250
0:9:16,976 --> 0:9:18,243
And some other stuff.


251
0:9:18,243 --> 0:9:20,713
- That's more like it.


252
0:9:20,713 --> 0:9:21,981
I'll see if I can find it.


253
0:9:21,981 --> 0:9:27,786
- Thanks, dad,
and sorry about being late.


254
0:9:27,786 --> 0:9:32,558
- Whoo, I am starting to like
this salsa.


255
0:9:32,558 --> 0:9:33,959
Well,
you think you like it now.


256
0:9:33,959 --> 0:9:35,461
Wait till I know what I'm doing.


257
0:9:35,461 --> 0:9:37,62
Oooh.


258
0:9:37,62 --> 0:9:39,798
- Yeah, you go, girl.


259
0:9:39,798 --> 0:9:42,935
Get your fine self
on out of here.


260
0:9:42,935 --> 0:9:51,577
You just go
and get yourself going.


261
0:9:51,577 --> 0:9:53,545
- So, honey,
it sounds good, right?


262
0:9:53,545 --> 0:9:55,247
And then at the end
of the series,


263
0:9:55,247 --> 0:9:58,17
We will get to perform
an entire routine.


264
0:9:58,17 --> 0:9:59,618
- Series?


265
0:9:59,618 --> 0:10:1,22
As in more than one?


266
0:10:1,22 --> 0:10:2,354
- Yeah.


267
0:10:2,354 --> 0:10:4,223
Honey, you can't learn to salsa
in an hour.


268
0:10:4,223 --> 0:10:5,557
I mean, really, come on.


269
0:10:5,557 --> 0:10:6,525
Oh, I'm so sorry.


270
0:10:6,525 --> 0:10:7,726
- That's okay.
Hey.


271
0:10:7,726 --> 0:10:8,961
- Uh...
- What?


272
0:10:8,961 --> 0:10:10,896
- Gigi, what are you doing?
What happened to you?


273
0:10:10,896 --> 0:10:12,898
You look like an extra
from <i>the color purple.</i>


274
0:10:12,898 --> 0:10:15,968
- I'm disguised
as a normal person.


275
0:10:15,968 --> 0:10:17,536
- Okay, why?


276
0:10:17,536 --> 0:10:19,838
- Because even if I can't resist
a salsa instructor,


277
0:10:19,838 --> 0:10:22,741
Maybe if I'm dressed like this,
he can resist me.


278
0:10:22,741 --> 0:10:25,844
Otherwise, I'll be shacked up
living off taquitos and beans.


279
0:10:25,844 --> 0:10:27,112
- Okay, taquitos are Mexican.


280
0:10:27,112 --> 0:10:29,848
- Shh, here he is.


281
0:10:29,848 --> 0:10:31,483
- <i>Hola,</i> everyone.


282
0:10:31,483 --> 0:10:33,185
Welcome to salsa 101.


283
0:10:33,185 --> 0:10:36,455
My name is Diego salsa,
and this is my assistant, Elena.


284
0:10:36,455 --> 0:10:37,69
- <i>Hola, amigos.</i>


285
0:10:37,69 --> 0:10:39,525
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?


286
0:10:39,525 --> 0:10:41,694
huh?


287
0:10:41,694 --> 0:10:43,228
- It's my salsa shirt.


288
0:10:43,228 --> 0:10:44,697
It was given to me by a woman.


289
0:10:44,697 --> 0:10:46,865
She said I was <i>muy caliente.</i>


290
0:10:46,865 --> 0:10:48,333
I'll give you details later.


291
0:10:48,333 --> 0:10:51,17
- Ooh, I like your shirt.


292
0:10:51,17 --> 0:10:56,208
You look like Fernando lamas.


293
0:10:56,208 --> 0:10:57,609
- All right, everyone,


294
0:10:57,609 --> 0:10:59,645
Elena and I have prepared
performance for you guys


295
0:10:59,645 --> 0:11:1,246
So you guys could see exactly
what you're gonna look like


296
0:11:1,246 --> 0:11:5,217
At the end of the series.


297
0:11:5,217 --> 0:11:9,621
oooh. I like that.


298
0:11:9,621 --> 0:11:11,123
Yeow!


299
0:11:11,123 --> 0:11:21,767
Oooh. Whoa.


300
0:11:21,767 --> 0:11:23,936
- All right, now I'd like you
to find your partners.


301
0:11:23,936 --> 0:11:26,772
- See, honey, together.


302
0:11:26,772 --> 0:11:29,508
- I got it.
I got it.


303
0:11:29,508 --> 0:11:31,243
- Would you mind dancing
with me?


304
0:11:31,243 --> 0:11:32,511
- No, I don't think so.


305
0:11:32,511 --> 0:11:34,346
- Don't be shy.


306
0:11:34,346 --> 0:11:36,782
The class needs to see
that even a normal-looking woman


307
0:11:36,782 --> 0:11:38,283
That nobody ever wants
to dance with


308
0:11:38,283 --> 0:11:40,919
Can become the woman she wants
through salsa.


309
0:11:40,919 --> 0:11:43,122
- Mm.
- What's your name?


310
0:11:43,122 --> 0:11:44,656
- Gigi.


311
0:11:44,656 --> 0:11:46,158
- Gigi?
- Mm-Hmm.


312
0:11:46,158 --> 0:11:47,96
- That is a beautiful name.
- Yep, thank you.


313
0:11:47,96 --> 0:11:49,795
- It's the letter g...
- Yep.


314
0:11:49,795 --> 0:11:53,999
- Twice.
- Yep.


315
0:11:53,999 --> 0:11:56,1
- Did everyone find
their partners?


316
0:11:56,1 --> 0:11:58,37
All right, this is where the man
takes the woman's right hand,


317
0:11:58,37 --> 0:12:0,806
Place in his left hand,
take the right hand,


318
0:12:0,806 --> 0:12:3,208
Place on her back,
and the lady takes the left hand


319
0:12:3,208 --> 0:12:5,711
And puts it on her man's
right shoulder.


320
0:12:5,711 --> 0:12:10,649
Then the man and his woman
look at each other in their eyes


321
0:12:10,649 --> 0:12:12,151
And begin.


322
0:12:12,151 --> 0:12:18,49
One, two, three.


323
0:12:18,49 --> 0:12:20,759
- Okay, Nick,
you're not doing it right.


324
0:12:20,759 --> 0:12:22,661
- No, I'm doing
what he told us to do.


325
0:12:22,661 --> 0:12:24,163
- Okay, well,
let's just try it again.


326
0:12:24,163 --> 0:12:25,164
- Okay.
- All right.


327
0:12:25,164 --> 0:12:26,331
- Here we go, baby.
We got it.


328
0:12:26,331 --> 0:12:28,534
- Okay, and one... ow, ow.


329
0:12:28,534 --> 0:12:30,769
Nick,
you keep stepping on my feet.


330
0:12:30,769 --> 0:12:32,7
- I'm trying to step
on the floor,


331
0:12:32,7 --> 0:12:34,373
But every time I do,
your feet get in the way.


332
0:12:34,373 --> 0:12:37,543
- Okay, okay, why don't we
have you dancing with Elena,


333
0:12:37,543 --> 0:12:39,511
And why don't we take you
and your amazing


334
0:12:39,511 --> 0:12:42,381
Technicolored dance shirt
over to beautiful Gigi?


335
0:12:42,381 --> 0:12:48,2
- Ohh.


336
0:12:48,2 --> 0:12:50,722
- Here we go. One, two, three,
five, six, seven.


337
0:12:50,722 --> 0:12:54,26
One, two, three,
five, six, seven.


338
0:12:54,26 --> 0:12:56,628
- Wow, you're a quick study.


339
0:12:56,628 --> 0:12:58,597
You have great form.


340
0:12:58,597 --> 0:13:1,266
- Oh,
you're not half bad yourself.


341
0:13:1,266 --> 0:13:4,436
- Diego,
can you show me how to do that?


342
0:13:4,436 --> 0:13:5,604
- I can certainly try.
- Okay.


343
0:13:5,604 --> 0:13:7,172
- Here we go.


344
0:13:7,172 --> 0:13:10,342
- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.


345
0:13:10,342 --> 0:13:11,777
- Okay, let's try that again,
and...


346
0:13:11,777 --> 0:13:13,145
- Oh.
- Are you okay?


347
0:13:13,145 --> 0:13:15,881
- Yeah, no, you know, I'm fine.


348
0:13:15,881 --> 0:13:18,684
My feet hurt, so I'm just gonna
sit down for a minute.


349
0:13:18,684 --> 0:13:22,187
Thank you.


350
0:13:22,187 --> 0:13:23,856
- Wow, this is great.
Here we go.


351
0:13:23,856 --> 0:13:24,89
- Whoo.


352
0:13:24,89 --> 0:13:27,926
- Now let's try the shake.


353
0:13:27,926 --> 0:13:29,194
- That's it.
- There you go.


354
0:13:29,194 --> 0:13:37,57
- I'm so glad my wife took me
to this class.


355
0:13:37,57 --> 0:13:38,258
- Good morning.


356
0:13:38,258 --> 0:13:40,594
- Good morning.


357
0:13:40,594 --> 0:13:43,53
- A present for <i>moi?</i>


358
0:13:43,53 --> 0:13:44,731
Did you look in it?


359
0:13:44,731 --> 0:13:46,366
- No.
- Oh, my gosh.


360
0:13:46,366 --> 0:13:47,501
It's so pretty.


361
0:13:47,501 --> 0:13:50,137
Let's see.


362
0:13:50,137 --> 0:13:53,73
"you are my flower.


363
0:13:53,73 --> 0:13:56,109
"I cannot wait
to see you blossom.


364
0:13:56,109 --> 0:13:59,112
"for my favorite student.


365
0:13:59,112 --> 0:14:1,481
Diego."


366
0:14:1,481 --> 0:14:7,954
Come on.
What is this?


367
0:14:7,954 --> 0:14:9,122
Damn.


368
0:14:9,122 --> 0:14:12,859
- A beautiful Latin man
sends you a sexy dress


369
0:14:12,859 --> 0:14:14,928
And says he can't wait
to see you blossom,


370
0:14:14,928 --> 0:14:16,53
And all you can say is "damn"?


371
0:14:16,53 --> 0:14:19,833
- I mean, who knew he would go
all <i>fat Greek wedding</i> on me?


372
0:14:19,833 --> 0:14:21,468
- Gigi.


373
0:14:21,468 --> 0:14:22,502
- What?


374
0:14:22,502 --> 0:14:24,37
- Maybe it's a sign.


375
0:14:24,37 --> 0:14:25,739
Okay,
he wants to see you blossom.


376
0:14:25,739 --> 0:14:27,474
Go ahead and blossom.


377
0:14:27,474 --> 0:14:30,177
You can do this.


378
0:14:30,177 --> 0:14:32,579
- Fine,
when are you going back?


379
0:14:32,579 --> 0:14:34,281
- Oh, I'm not going back.


380
0:14:34,281 --> 0:14:35,382
- Why?


381
0:14:35,382 --> 0:14:37,5
Nick looked like he was having
a good time.


382
0:14:37,5 --> 0:14:38,718
- Yeah, did you notice
it wasn't with me?


383
0:14:38,718 --> 0:14:40,86
- No,
'cause I couldn't see much


384
0:14:40,86 --> 0:14:42,222
Behind Martin's
technicolored dance shirt.


385
0:14:42,222 --> 0:14:43,89
- I took this class
to be with Nick,


386
0:14:43,89 --> 0:14:45,425
Not to watch him be
with somebody else,


387
0:14:45,425 --> 0:14:47,527
And then I freaked out on him
when I got home.


388
0:14:47,527 --> 0:14:49,162
- Wait, Suzanne.


389
0:14:49,162 --> 0:14:51,431
You've never taken
a salsa class before?


390
0:14:51,431 --> 0:14:53,333
- No,
I thought I'd learn with him.


391
0:14:53,333 --> 0:14:54,734
- See,
that's where you went wrong.


392
0:14:54,734 --> 0:14:57,871
I always do recon before I take
a lesson with a man.


393
0:14:57,871 --> 0:14:59,439
I want to know
what I'm supposed to know,


394
0:14:59,439 --> 0:15:0,974
Because even if I don't know it,
I know one thing.


395
0:15:0,974 --> 0:15:2,576
I'm not gonna be out there
looking like I don't know


396
0:15:2,576 --> 0:15:5,11
And not know it.


397
0:15:5,11 --> 0:15:6,346
- Was that advice?


398
0:15:6,346 --> 0:15:8,281
- You better ask somebody.


399
0:15:8,281 --> 0:15:9,583
Did you like it?


400
0:15:9,583 --> 0:15:16,79
- You know it.


401
0:15:16,79 --> 0:15:18,725
Hi.


402
0:15:18,725 --> 0:15:20,193
- <i>Hola.</i>
Suzanne, right?


403
0:15:20,193 --> 0:15:21,228
- Mm-Hmm.


404
0:15:21,228 --> 0:15:22,462
- You were here last night.


405
0:15:22,462 --> 0:15:24,731
- Yeah, you danced
with my husband, Nick.


406
0:15:24,731 --> 0:15:26,666
- Yes, I remember.


407
0:15:26,666 --> 0:15:28,335
He's a little rough
around the edges,


408
0:15:28,335 --> 0:15:30,103
But he's not bad.


409
0:15:30,103 --> 0:15:31,638
If the two of you take
a few more classes,


410
0:15:31,638 --> 0:15:33,406
You'll be out on that floor
in no time.


411
0:15:33,406 --> 0:15:36,476
- Oh, well, that's actually
kind of why I'm here.


412
0:15:36,476 --> 0:15:39,79
I was hoping to get a refund
on the remaining classes.


413
0:15:39,79 --> 0:15:40,547
- <i>¿por que?</i>


414
0:15:40,547 --> 0:15:42,516
- What?
- Why?


415
0:15:42,516 --> 0:15:44,317
- What why?
- The refund.


416
0:15:44,317 --> 0:15:48,455
Oh, oh, okay, yeah,
I thought I would enjoy it,


417
0:15:48,455 --> 0:15:49,923
But I didn't, so...


418
0:15:49,923 --> 0:15:52,792
- Suzanne,
can I be honest with you?


419
0:15:52,792 --> 0:15:54,27
- <i>Si.</i>


420
0:15:54,27 --> 0:15:56,329
- Diego danced with you,
and afterwards,


421
0:15:56,329 --> 0:15:58,665
He told me you could be
a decent dancer,


422
0:15:58,665 --> 0:16:0,867
But he said
you're a control freak.


423
0:16:0,867 --> 0:16:1,835
- What?


424
0:16:1,835 --> 0:16:3,203
That is so rude.


425
0:16:3,203 --> 0:16:7,541
- In salsa, the man has to lead,
and the woman has to follow.


426
0:16:7,541 --> 0:16:9,976
Otherwise, it doesn't work.


427
0:16:9,976 --> 0:16:12,612
- Okay, but I thought I was
letting him lead.


428
0:16:12,612 --> 0:16:14,881
- Can I show you something?


429
0:16:14,881 --> 0:16:16,85
- Uh, yeah, sure.


430
0:16:16,85 --> 0:16:18,451
- Great, just relax.


431
0:16:18,451 --> 0:16:19,686
- Okay.


432
0:16:19,686 --> 0:16:21,321
- In salsa,
it's all about letting go,


433
0:16:21,321 --> 0:16:23,356
Starting with this foot, back.


434
0:16:23,356 --> 0:16:24,457
Good.


435
0:16:24,457 --> 0:16:26,86
Let the music transfer
through your body.


436
0:16:26,86 --> 0:16:27,827
You might want to look up.


437
0:16:27,827 --> 0:16:29,262
- Oh, sorry.
- There you go.


438
0:16:29,262 --> 0:16:30,797
- Now we're gonna go
to the side.


439
0:16:30,797 --> 0:16:32,299
Good.
Now let loose.


440
0:16:32,299 --> 0:16:33,266
- Okay.


441
0:16:33,266 --> 0:16:35,936
- I knew you were gonna be
a natural.


442
0:16:35,936 --> 0:16:40,106
And turn, side, ole.


443
0:16:40,106 --> 0:16:41,641
- Wow.


444
0:16:41,641 --> 0:16:43,71
Oh, goodness.


445
0:16:43,71 --> 0:16:44,911
- Please come back to us.


446
0:16:44,911 --> 0:16:46,813
- Okay, maybe I will.


447
0:16:46,813 --> 0:16:50,283
- Can you bring your friend,
the one with the glasses?


448
0:16:50,283 --> 0:16:51,718
- Here I am.


449
0:16:51,718 --> 0:16:52,886
- <i>Mi Amor.</i>


450
0:16:52,886 --> 0:16:56,56
- Yes, I <i>Amor.</i>


451
0:16:56,56 --> 0:16:57,57
- Yes.


452
0:16:57,57 --> 0:16:59,392
Yes, how you have blossomed.


453
0:16:59,392 --> 0:17:2,262
My gift looks <i>muy caliente.</i>


454
0:17:2,262 --> 0:17:3,563
- <i>Gracias.</i>


455
0:17:3,563 --> 0:17:7,367
- I know you are a rare thing,
a delicate flower.


456
0:17:7,367 --> 0:17:9,436
I would love nothing more
than to take our dance


457
0:17:9,436 --> 0:17:10,971
Into the real world.


458
0:17:10,971 --> 0:17:12,305
Can I please take you out?


459
0:17:12,305 --> 0:17:14,307
- No, Diego.
I cannot go out with you.


460
0:17:14,307 --> 0:17:16,81
I am just here
to face my demons.


461
0:17:16,81 --> 0:17:18,445
- <i>¿por que?</i>
- What?


462
0:17:18,445 --> 0:17:20,8
- Why?
- What why?


463
0:17:20,8 --> 0:17:22,148
- Demons.
- Demons.


464
0:17:22,148 --> 0:17:23,516
Oh, yes, demons.


465
0:17:23,516 --> 0:17:27,854
I can't let myself fall for you,
so this...


466
0:17:27,854 --> 0:17:32,92
This will have to be
our last dance.


467
0:17:32,92 --> 0:17:34,27
- Then we have to make it
a great one.


468
0:17:34,27 --> 0:17:36,563
- Mm.


469
0:17:36,563 --> 0:17:43,336
Ahh.


470
0:17:43,336 --> 0:17:48,241
- Okay, Elena,
he just oozing sensuality.


471
0:17:48,241 --> 0:17:50,43
How do you handle it?


472
0:17:50,43 --> 0:17:52,779
- After a while,
you get used to it,


473
0:17:52,779 --> 0:17:54,681
But why wouldn't she
want to go out with him?


474
0:17:54,681 --> 0:17:57,984
He's beautiful, romantic,
and he can dance.


475
0:17:57,984 --> 0:17:59,619
- And he's broke.


476
0:17:59,619 --> 0:18:1,154
- Diego?


477
0:18:1,154 --> 0:18:3,223
His last name is salsa.


478
0:18:3,223 --> 0:18:5,392
His family owns the name salsa.


479
0:18:5,392 --> 0:18:8,962
He's worth over $500 million.


480
0:18:8,962 --> 0:18:11,831
- Are you serious?


481
0:18:11,831 --> 0:18:14,501
- Just kidding.
He's broke.


482
0:18:14,501 --> 0:18:16,67
- Okay, Gigi, stop looking.


483
0:18:16,67 --> 0:18:17,637
Don't look into the light.


484
0:18:17,637 --> 0:18:18,838
- What?
- Come on. Let's go.


485
0:18:18,838 --> 0:18:19,773
Bye-bye, Diego.


486
0:18:19,773 --> 0:18:21,541
Bye-bye. See ya.
Thank you so much.


487
0:18:21,541 --> 0:18:23,443
No, no, no, this way.
Let's go.


488
0:18:23,443 --> 0:18:29,291
- Can't help it.


489
0:18:29,291 --> 0:18:30,693
- Hey, mommy.


490
0:18:30,693 --> 0:18:33,229
- Hey, sweetheart.


491
0:18:33,229 --> 0:18:35,998
- Wow, that's a nice new watch.


492
0:18:35,998 --> 0:18:37,66
Where'd you get that?


493
0:18:37,66 --> 0:18:38,2
- Dad bought it for me.


494
0:18:38,2 --> 0:18:40,603
- Oh, well, what was wrong
with your old watch?


495
0:18:40,603 --> 0:18:43,205
- It wasn't working, so
he thought I needed a new one.


496
0:18:43,205 --> 0:18:50,879
- Oh, okay.


497
0:18:50,879 --> 0:18:51,88
So, honey.


498
0:18:51,88 --> 0:18:52,982
- Hey.
- Hey.


499
0:18:52,982 --> 0:18:55,184
I just saw Lindsey's new watch.


500
0:18:55,184 --> 0:18:56,685
- Yeah, she needed a new one.


501
0:18:56,685 --> 0:18:58,2
Her old one was making her late.


502
0:18:58,2 --> 0:18:59,788
- Really?
Let me guess.


503
0:18:59,788 --> 0:19:4,193
So she was late because
her old watch wasn't working,


504
0:19:4,193 --> 0:19:6,829
So she needed a new pink one
with rhinestones.


505
0:19:6,829 --> 0:19:8,297
- Right.


506
0:19:8,297 --> 0:19:10,165
- Mm-Hmm, Nick, watch this.


507
0:19:10,165 --> 0:19:11,166
Lindsey.


508
0:19:11,166 --> 0:19:12,268
- Yeah, mom?


509
0:19:12,268 --> 0:19:13,936
- What time is it, honey?


510
0:19:13,936 --> 0:19:16,171
- It's 7:38.


511
0:19:16,171 --> 0:19:17,206
- Thank you.


512
0:19:17,206 --> 0:19:19,141
- No problem.


513
0:19:19,141 --> 0:19:21,76
- You see that?


514
0:19:21,76 --> 0:19:22,411
She didn't even look
at her watch.


515
0:19:22,411 --> 0:19:24,513
She uses her phone
to tell the time.


516
0:19:24,513 --> 0:19:26,815
- Wow, she's good.


517
0:19:26,815 --> 0:19:28,217
- She got me.


518
0:19:28,217 --> 0:19:29,852
- Well,
I know now for next time.


519
0:19:29,852 --> 0:19:31,353
- I hope so.


520
0:19:31,353 --> 0:19:33,789
- Well, I've got a full day
ahead of me tomorrow.


521
0:19:33,789 --> 0:19:35,324
I'm taking Kevin to the x games.


522
0:19:35,324 --> 0:19:37,559
- Wow, that's really nice.


523
0:19:37,559 --> 0:19:38,727
- Yeah, it's the least I can do


524
0:19:38,727 --> 0:19:40,963
Since I couldn't get him
the mariners tickets.


525
0:19:40,963 --> 0:19:42,131
- Mariners tickets?


526
0:19:42,131 --> 0:19:44,333
Since when is Kevin
into baseball like that?


527
0:19:44,333 --> 0:19:45,701
- It's a consolation prize.


528
0:19:45,701 --> 0:19:48,637
I mean, I felt bad, so I got him
the x games tickets instead.


529
0:19:48,637 --> 0:19:51,14
- Nick, hold on a second.


530
0:19:51,14 --> 0:19:54,176
Kevin.


531
0:19:54,176 --> 0:19:57,313
- Yeah, mom.


532
0:19:57,313 --> 0:20:0,215
- So some mariners tickets
opened up this weekend,


533
0:20:0,215 --> 0:20:2,918
So you can go to that
instead of the x games.


534
0:20:2,918 --> 0:20:4,887
- They did?
- Mm-Hmm.


535
0:20:4,887 --> 0:20:6,655
- Oh, well, you know,
maybe me and dad


536
0:20:6,655 --> 0:20:9,58
Should just go to the x games,
you know,


537
0:20:9,58 --> 0:20:11,527
Since dad already bought
the tickets and everything.


538
0:20:11,527 --> 0:20:14,229
And, you know, somebody else
can go to the baseball game


539
0:20:14,229 --> 0:20:16,65
Instead of me and you,
you know,


540
0:20:16,65 --> 0:20:20,69
If they ever find out
that they can get tickets.


541
0:20:20,69 --> 0:20:21,403
- You see that?


542
0:20:21,403 --> 0:20:23,372
- I haven't seen a tap dance
like that


543
0:20:23,372 --> 0:20:25,574
Since <i>bring in 'da noise,</i>
<i>bring in 'da funk.</i>


544
0:20:25,574 --> 0:20:27,42
- Kevin, go to your room.


545
0:20:27,42 --> 0:20:28,377
- Yes, ma'am.


546
0:20:28,377 --> 0:20:30,412
- He was so believable too,


547
0:20:30,412 --> 0:20:33,215
Like a little will Smith
with the ears and everything.


548
0:20:33,215 --> 0:20:36,518
- Mm-Hmm,
it's the old bait and switch.


549
0:20:36,518 --> 0:20:38,554
- Where do these kids learn
to do stuff like that?


550
0:20:38,554 --> 0:20:39,955
- I don't know.


551
0:20:39,955 --> 0:20:41,724
- I wish there was a class to
teach you how to deal with it.


552
0:20:41,724 --> 0:20:43,125
- I think there is.


553
0:20:43,125 --> 0:20:49,264
Hey,
you want to take it together?


554
0:20:49,264 --> 0:20:51,467
Nick, wake up.


555
0:20:51,467 --> 0:20:54,603
- Oh, this is the class
I want to take.


556
0:20:54,603 --> 0:20:56,818
Bait and switch.
