0:0:11,58 --> 0:0:14,74
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: My mom would
tell me a dream that she


4
0:0:14,74 --> 0:0:16,475
used to have when she
was a little kid.


5
0:0:16,475 --> 0:0:20,4
She would dream that her dog
died and that they buried it.


6
0:0:20,4 --> 0:0:22,2
And then, in the middle
of the night, it would


7
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:23,2
come back to life.


8
0:0:23,2 --> 0:0:25,8
Except it wasn't like it
was when it was alive.


9
0:0:25,8 --> 0:0:28,58
It came back in a bunch
of little pieces all


10
0:0:28,58 --> 0:0:30,11
put together wrong.


11
0:0:30,11 --> 0:0:32,58
That always scared the
daylights out of me.


12
0:0:32,58 --> 0:0:36,7



13
0:0:36,7 --> 0:0:39,17
This is my taxidermy
shop, where all


14
0:0:39,17 --> 0:0:43,46
of the action happens.


15
0:0:43,46 --> 0:0:47,79
This is all the animals that
I have in my freezer.


16
0:0:47,79 --> 0:0:49,61
Frozen red fox skin.


17
0:0:49,61 --> 0:0:51,84
I have several birds in here
I'm going to practice on,


18
0:0:51,84 --> 0:0:54,12
since I don't do
many birds yet.


19
0:0:54,12 --> 0:0:55,65
This is a skunk.


20
0:0:55,65 --> 0:0:59,36
This is actually going to be a
kitten in a playful position.


21
0:0:59,36 --> 0:1:1,48
Here's some frozen squirrels.


22
0:1:1,48 --> 0:1:4,26
The mounted squirrels are a
really good seller on eBay.


23
0:1:4,26 --> 0:1:6,14
If I need squirrels
fast, I'll shoot


24
0:1:6,14 --> 0:1:7,61
them with a .410 shotgun.


25
0:1:7,61 --> 0:1:10,32
That makes it a lot faster
to get squirrels.


26
0:1:10,32 --> 0:1:12,72
But you can shoot them with
a .22 rifle as well.


27
0:1:12,72 --> 0:1:14,36
Just takes more skill.


28
0:1:14,36 --> 0:1:16,84
INTERVIEWER: So when did you
begin to support yourself as a


29
0:1:16,84 --> 0:1:17,82
taxidermist?


30
0:1:17,82 --> 0:1:20,9
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Well, as
soon as I started doing stuff


31
0:1:20,9 --> 0:1:23,11
for customers when I was
15, I realized I could


32
0:1:23,11 --> 0:1:24,32
put stuff on eBay.


33
0:1:24,32 --> 0:1:28,41
And from about age 16 on up,
I was making a pretty good


34
0:1:28,41 --> 0:1:31,94
living selling stuff on eBay
alone, in addition to the


35
0:1:31,94 --> 0:1:33,67
customer mounts I
was getting in.


36
0:1:33,67 --> 0:1:36,38
INTERVIEWER: What did people
your age think about it?


37
0:1:36,38 --> 0:1:37,4
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER:
Like my friends?


38
0:1:37,4 --> 0:1:39,66
They thought it was
interesting.


39
0:1:39,66 --> 0:1:41,55
They thought it was gross too.


40
0:1:41,55 --> 0:1:44,1
Most people, I just show
the finished mount to.


41
0:1:44,1 --> 0:1:46,82
That way they could really
appreciate the beauty.


42
0:1:46,82 --> 0:1:49,9
A lot of people can't handle
the skinning--


43
0:1:49,9 --> 0:1:51,23
the behind the scenes.


44
0:1:51,23 --> 0:1:52,535
INTERVIEWER: And you were
saying that you had some


45
0:1:52,535 --> 0:1:54,375
trouble with PETA when you
were very young, right?


46
0:1:54,375 --> 0:1:57,39
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Yeah, I've
gotten lots of hate mail from


47
0:1:57,39 --> 0:2:0,36
animal rights activists and
people who just don't agree


48
0:2:0,36 --> 0:2:2,12
with killing animals
in general.


49
0:2:2,12 --> 0:2:5,97
It's gone so far as to where
they hacked into my website.


50
0:2:5,97 --> 0:2:10,9
They replaced the photo on my
website with a photo of an


51
0:2:10,9 --> 0:2:11,84
aborted fetus.


52
0:2:11,84 --> 0:2:14,17
I think they were trying to
say what I was doing to


53
0:2:14,17 --> 0:2:17,835
animals was as bad as doing that
to a person, I guess they


54
0:2:17,835 --> 0:2:18,99
were trying to say.


55
0:2:18,99 --> 0:2:20,24
INTERVIEWER: So what are
we going to do with


56
0:2:20,24 --> 0:2:21,54
this little guy here?


57
0:2:21,54 --> 0:2:22,91
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: This is a
gray fox that we're going to


58
0:2:22,91 --> 0:2:24,54
be skinning today.


59
0:2:24,54 --> 0:2:26,77
And I'm going to show
you how I turn him


60
0:2:26,77 --> 0:2:29,84
into a finished piece.


61
0:2:29,84 --> 0:2:31,79
I'm going to get the tools
together that I'm going to


62
0:2:31,79 --> 0:2:32,86
need for skinning--


63
0:2:32,86 --> 0:2:36,11
which really, all it is is a
scalpel, pair of scissors, and


64
0:2:36,11 --> 0:2:37,48
a pair of pliers.


65
0:2:37,48 --> 0:2:41,33
I'm going to start right up here
between the ears, stick


66
0:2:41,33 --> 0:2:44,65
in my scalpel, which
is fresh and sharp.


67
0:2:44,65 --> 0:2:47,31
Usually it takes me about
20 or 30 minutes to


68
0:2:47,31 --> 0:2:49,82
totally skin a fox.


69
0:2:49,82 --> 0:2:52,65
The fox, it's impossible
to skin all the


70
0:2:52,65 --> 0:2:53,88
way down to the toes.


71
0:2:53,88 --> 0:2:57,18
So what I'm going to have to do
is break the bone and cut


72
0:2:57,18 --> 0:2:59,571
it off right here.


73
0:2:59,571 --> 0:3:2,26
OK, I'm going to skin
the tail now.


74
0:3:2,26 --> 0:3:5,0
This is the grossest part,
considering where you're


75
0:3:5,0 --> 0:3:8,97
working at, you know,
underneath the tail.


76
0:3:8,97 --> 0:3:10,61
INTERVIEWER: When your husband
first met you, what did he


77
0:3:10,61 --> 0:3:12,52
think about the taxidermy
business?


78
0:3:12,52 --> 0:3:15,35
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: He thought
it was really interesting.


79
0:3:15,35 --> 0:3:16,88
We met on the internet.


80
0:3:16,88 --> 0:3:19,48
But we started talking about
taxidermy right off.


81
0:3:19,48 --> 0:3:21,44
And that's why he became
interested.


82
0:3:21,44 --> 0:3:23,54
INTERVIEWER: What'd you guys
do on your first date?


83
0:3:23,54 --> 0:3:25,27
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: We actually
went to a gun show.


84
0:3:25,27 --> 0:3:26,1
INTERVIEWER: Really?


85
0:3:26,1 --> 0:3:26,58
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Yeah.


86
0:3:26,58 --> 0:3:27,35
Looked at the guns.


87
0:3:27,35 --> 0:3:29,95
And then he came back to my
house and I showed him my


88
0:3:29,95 --> 0:3:31,44
taxidermy shop.


89
0:3:31,44 --> 0:3:35,5
Robby is somewhat of a cowboy,
I guess you could say.


90
0:3:35,5 --> 0:3:37,18
He likes wearing the
Western clothes and


91
0:3:37,18 --> 0:3:39,25
the big belt buckle.


92
0:3:39,25 --> 0:3:42,3
And he's ridden bulls
in the past too.


93
0:3:42,3 --> 0:3:44,22
INTERVIEWER: Do you ever have
people bring you their pets to


94
0:3:44,22 --> 0:3:45,88
preserve after they die?


95
0:3:45,88 --> 0:3:48,37
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: I've done
a poodle for a lady.


96
0:3:48,37 --> 0:3:50,98
And I've also done a cat rug.


97
0:3:50,98 --> 0:3:52,25
The lady wasn't local.


98
0:3:52,25 --> 0:3:55,27
She was from New
York, actually.


99
0:3:55,27 --> 0:3:58,22
And she sent me her poodle
in the mail.


100
0:3:58,22 --> 0:4:0,71
She overnighted it with
some dry ice.


101
0:4:0,71 --> 0:4:3,26
And once I got it, I mounted
it for her in a sleeping


102
0:4:3,26 --> 0:4:6,15
position and then I mailed
it back to her.


103
0:4:6,15 --> 0:4:7,79
INTERVIEWER: Do you think you'll
mount your own pets


104
0:4:7,79 --> 0:4:8,635
when they die?


105
0:4:8,635 --> 0:4:8,93
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Mm-hm.


106
0:4:8,93 --> 0:4:13,9
I have a dog and a cat and a
snake that I would possibly


107
0:4:13,9 --> 0:4:15,2
mount once they die.


108
0:4:15,2 --> 0:4:18,645
But it'll just be a decision
I'll have to make at the time.


109
0:4:18,645 --> 0:4:20,29
Are you at the ears now?


110
0:4:20,29 --> 0:4:22,4
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Yes,
I'm at the ears.


111
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:24,5
This is the ear right here.


112
0:4:24,5 --> 0:4:25,32
See that hole there?


113
0:4:25,32 --> 0:4:27,2
That's the inner ear.


114
0:4:27,2 --> 0:4:29,32
This is the most interesting
part, when I get to go around


115
0:4:29,32 --> 0:4:31,12
the eyes and the ears.


116
0:4:31,12 --> 0:4:36,72
It's interesting to take the
eyelid away from the eye.


117
0:4:36,72 --> 0:4:38,84
You can see the nasal
cavity there.


118
0:4:38,84 --> 0:4:43,25
I just removed the nose
along with the skin.


119
0:4:43,25 --> 0:4:43,96
There you go.


120
0:4:43,96 --> 0:4:48,1
The hide is now removed
from the carcass.


121
0:4:48,1 --> 0:4:51,4
The first thing you always have
to do is prepare the form


122
0:4:51,4 --> 0:4:53,16
that's going to go
inside of it.


123
0:4:53,16 --> 0:4:55,35
INTERVIEWER: Do you ever watch
horror movies or slasher


124
0:4:55,35 --> 0:4:58,28
flicks, like "Texas Chainsaw
Massacre" or anything?


125
0:4:58,28 --> 0:4:59,8
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER:
Actually, no.


126
0:4:59,8 --> 0:5:2,22
I don't have any desire to
watch movies like that.


127
0:5:2,22 --> 0:5:5,86
I have mounted some squirrels
for the "Texas Chainsaw


128
0:5:5,86 --> 0:5:7,3
Massacre" movie.


129
0:5:7,3 --> 0:5:8,24
INTERVIEWER: How did
they find you?


130
0:5:8,24 --> 0:5:9,7
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: They found
me through my website.


131
0:5:9,7 --> 0:5:12,69
They called me and said they
needed 12 squirrels mounted in


132
0:5:12,69 --> 0:5:15,28
a dead position for one
of their shoots.


133
0:5:15,28 --> 0:5:17,33
Yeah.


134
0:5:17,33 --> 0:5:19,6
I haven't seen it because
I don't want to


135
0:5:19,6 --> 0:5:22,5
see movies like that.


136
0:5:22,5 --> 0:5:24,23
INTERVIEWER: So do you
have any hobbies?


137
0:5:24,23 --> 0:5:25,93
Things you do on the side?


138
0:5:25,93 --> 0:5:27,82
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: My main
hobbies are hunting and


139
0:5:27,82 --> 0:5:29,24
playing the piano.


140
0:5:29,24 --> 0:5:30,91
INTERVIEWER: Do you really
hunt with the crossbow?


141
0:5:30,91 --> 0:5:31,42
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Oh, yeah.


142
0:5:31,42 --> 0:5:32,642
I've shot a dear with this.


143
0:5:32,642 --> 0:5:33,466
INTERVIEWER: Yeah?


144
0:5:33,466 --> 0:5:34,29
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: Yeah.


145
0:5:34,29 --> 0:5:35,63
INTERVIEWER: Is it harder
to hunt with a


146
0:5:35,63 --> 0:5:36,88
crossbow than with a gun?


147
0:5:36,88 --> 0:5:38,11
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER:
Definitely.


148
0:5:38,11 --> 0:5:41,16
You've got to get the deer in
about as close as that target


149
0:5:41,16 --> 0:5:42,582
is right there.


150
0:5:42,582 --> 0:5:47,8



151
0:5:47,8 --> 0:5:50,58
That was a bull's-eye
right there.


152
0:5:50,58 --> 0:5:51,62
INTERVIEWER: What instrument
do you play?


153
0:5:51,62 --> 0:5:53,32
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER:
I play the piano.


154
0:5:53,32 --> 0:5:54,91
INTERVIEWER: What
kind of music?


155
0:5:54,91 --> 0:5:56,96
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER:
John Tesh, mainly.


156
0:5:56,96 --> 0:5:58,806
A lot of John Tesh and Yanni.


157
0:5:58,806 --> 0:6:2,278
I actually met him when he
was in concert one time.


158
0:6:2,278 --> 0:6:12,32



159
0:6:12,32 --> 0:6:14,44
INTERVIEWER: Do you ever because
you work on a mount


160
0:6:14,44 --> 0:6:17,24
for so long sort of give it a
name in your head, like I'm


161
0:6:17,24 --> 0:6:20,17
going to work on "Bob"
today or something?


162
0:6:20,17 --> 0:6:21,54
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: I don't
really anymore.


163
0:6:21,54 --> 0:6:23,73
I used to sometimes
give them names.


164
0:6:23,73 --> 0:6:27,89
I would actually give them names
of guys that I liked.


165
0:6:27,89 --> 0:6:30,88
Actually, the antelope up
there, his name is Dan.


166
0:6:30,88 --> 0:6:32,71
INTERVIEWER: What
was Dan like?


167
0:6:32,71 --> 0:6:34,59
AMY RITCHIE-CARTER: He was just
real friendly and nice.


168
0:6:34,59 --> 0:6:36,42
But he doesn't even know
that there's an


169
0:6:36,42 --> 0:6:38,28
antelope named after him.


170
0:6:38,28 --> 0:6:43,8



171
0:6:43,8 --> 0:6:46,45
This is pretty much the
finished product.


172
0:6:46,45 --> 0:6:48,62
He's going to need to be
sewed on his back and


173
0:6:48,62 --> 0:6:49,86
sewed on the tail.


174
0:6:49,86 --> 0:6:55,11
And I'll put him on a habitat
base and he'll be ready to go.


175
0:6:55,11 --> 0:6:59,75
Sometimes at night, I do
remember images of skinned


176
0:6:59,75 --> 0:7:2,22
carcasses and just creepy
stuff like that.


177
0:7:2,22 --> 0:7:3,57
It does bother me sometimes.


178
0:7:3,57 --> 0:7:6,92
But I think I kind of just
put it out of my mind.


179
0:7:6,92 --> 0:7:8,48
I'm very happy right now.


180
0:7:8,48 --> 0:7:9,89
I'm the happiest
I've ever been.


181
0:7:9,89 --> 0:7:13,42
I've got my own house and I'm
married now, so I'm pretty


182
0:7:13,42 --> 0:7:15,49
much where I want to
be for right now.


183
0:7:15,49 --> 0:9:15,49
