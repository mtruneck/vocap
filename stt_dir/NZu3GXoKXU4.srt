1
0:0:2,969 --> 0:0:6,6
The story of Noah building an ark
to save his family


2
0:0:6,6 --> 0:0:7,44
and save thousands of animals


3
0:0:7,44 --> 0:0:10,276
from a flood
which destroys all life on earth


4
0:0:10,276 --> 0:0:15,48
is an epic
from many people's childhoods.


5
0:0:15,48 --> 0:0:17,45
It's a wonderful story,
found in the Bible,


6
0:0:17,45 --> 0:0:19,686
The Koran and the Torah.


7
0:0:19,686 --> 0:0:24,29
But is it in fact, real history?


8
0:0:24,29 --> 0:0:26,26
Now the technology exists


9
0:0:26,26 --> 0:0:27,794
to examine this well known epic


10
0:0:27,794 --> 0:0:31,97
with the eyes of science.


11
0:0:31,97 --> 0:0:32,399
We will weigh out the evidence


12
0:0:32,399 --> 0:0:37,437
from archaeological finds in Iraq...


13
0:0:37,437 --> 0:0:38,805
We will examine the proof


14
0:0:38,805 --> 0:0:43,51
that a global flood
did cover the whole planet...


15
0:0:43,51 --> 0:0:46,312
We'll also create
a historically accurate picture


16
0:0:46,312 --> 0:0:49,349
of the real Noah:
who he was, where he lived


17
0:0:49,349 --> 0:1:14,741
and what he might have looked like.


18
0:1:14,741 --> 0:1:17,444
The story of Noah is told
in the Book of Genesis


19
0:1:17,444 --> 0:1:19,446
in the Bible and the Torah.


20
0:1:19,446 --> 0:1:21,214
It's set somewhere
in the middle-east


21
0:1:21,214 --> 0:1:25,151
about 5000 years ago.


22
0:1:25,151 --> 0:1:27,12
Noah's family includes his wife,


23
0:1:27,12 --> 0:1:30,824
his three sons -
Shem, Ham and Japheth,


24
0:1:30,824 --> 0:1:34,394
and their brides.


25
0:1:34,394 --> 0:1:36,896
Noah stands out as a good person -


26
0:1:36,896 --> 0:1:39,99
the only virtuous man left
in a world


27
0:1:39,99 --> 0:1:46,873
that had become filled
with corruption and violence.


28
0:1:46,873 --> 0:1:48,975
He is described as a wine-grower,


29
0:1:48,975 --> 0:1:50,977
a claim that has
an authentic ring to it


30
0:1:50,977 --> 0:1:53,12
as wine was grown
in the middle east


31
0:1:53,12 --> 0:1:56,116
as far back as 3000BC.


32
0:1:56,116 --> 0:1:58,184
And this reference also provides


33
0:1:58,184 --> 0:2:2,21
a rare insight
into Noah's character.


34
0:2:2,21 --> 0:2:5,992
After the flood, the Bible says
Noah planted the first vineyard.


35
0:2:5,992 --> 0:2:13,166
But it also tells us
that Noah had a weakness


36
0:2:13,166 --> 0:2:14,601
Having made the first wine,


37
0:2:14,601 --> 0:2:19,5
the story goes that Noah
drank too much of it.


38
0:2:19,5 --> 0:2:21,407
In fact, one night this Holy Man


39
0:2:21,407 --> 0:2:38,825
collapses naked and drunk.


40
0:2:38,825 --> 0:2:40,126
Horrified his sons


41
0:2:40,126 --> 0:2:51,37
Ham and Shem cover their father.


42
0:2:51,37 --> 0:2:52,839
In the morning,
Noah is embarrassed -


43
0:2:52,839 --> 0:2:55,341
and perhaps suffering
the first ever hangover -


44
0:2:55,341 --> 0:3:0,48
he curses the sons
who saw him naked.


45
0:3:0,48 --> 0:3:2,949
He sound like a flawed
and complex man


46
0:3:2,949 --> 0:3:12,792
but perhaps that is true
of all great men.


47
0:3:12,792 --> 0:3:15,61
But Noah was probably
a very reliable man,


48
0:3:15,61 --> 0:3:18,965
because God gives him
a very big mission.


49
0:3:18,965 --> 0:3:21,668
The story goes that God
warned Noah in a dream


50
0:3:21,668 --> 0:3:23,803
that he was going to
punish humanity for its sins


51
0:3:23,803 --> 0:3:30,176
with a flood that would cover
the whole earth.


52
0:3:30,176 --> 0:3:31,945
To save Noah and his family


53
0:3:31,945 --> 0:3:34,214
God told him to build
a boat of wood


54
0:3:34,214 --> 0:3:38,318
and to line it
with pitch inside and out.


55
0:3:38,318 --> 0:3:40,853
He also ordered Noah
to give the ark three decks,


56
0:3:40,853 --> 0:3:45,225
a roof and a door.


57
0:3:45,225 --> 0:3:47,227
But the most surprising
of God's instructions


58
0:3:47,227 --> 0:3:51,364
was the sheer size of the Ark.


59
0:3:51,364 --> 0:3:54,934
The Bible spells it out- in cubits.


60
0:3:54,934 --> 0:3:58,304
Traditionally a cubit was the length
of a man's forearm -


61
0:3:58,304 --> 0:4:1,441
about one and a half feet.


62
0:4:1,441 --> 0:4:4,911
The Bible says Noah built
an Ark 300 cubits long


63
0:4:4,911 --> 0:4:8,648
and 50 cubits wide by 30 high.


64
0:4:8,648 --> 0:4:10,984
That's almost as big as
modern super tankers


65
0:4:10,984 --> 0:4:25,498
and cruise liners like Titanic.


66
0:4:25,498 --> 0:4:27,8
Nearly 450 feet long,


67
0:4:27,8 --> 0:4:30,36
it would have been
a magnificent sight -


68
0:4:30,36 --> 0:4:37,644
certainly the biggest boat
in the ancient world.


69
0:4:37,644 --> 0:4:44,284
quite an achievement
for an ordinary man


70
0:4:44,284 --> 0:4:45,685
Now the Bible assumes


71
0:4:45,685 --> 0:4:47,12
it was possible to build


72
0:4:47,12 --> 0:4:50,89
this monster vessel
out of wood alone.


73
0:4:50,89 --> 0:5:3,236
It's a pretty big assumption.


74
0:5:3,236 --> 0:5:4,904
The familiar image
from the story books


75
0:5:4,904 --> 0:5:6,372
and cartoons of our childhood


76
0:5:6,372 --> 0:5:7,974
is of a huge wooden ark


77
0:5:7,974 --> 0:5:11,577
with the animals marching
inside two by two.


78
0:5:11,577 --> 0:5:14,414
But that is a 19TH Century image.


79
0:5:14,414 --> 0:5:15,682
It is completely at odds


80
0:5:15,682 --> 0:5:19,585
with what could be built
in Biblical times.


81
0:5:19,585 --> 0:5:21,2
According to Tom Vosmer,


82
0:5:21,2 --> 0:5:22,689
an expert on ancient boats,


83
0:5:22,689 --> 0:5:24,757
not even 19TH century engineers


84
0:5:24,757 --> 0:5:29,562
could have built a 450 ft Ark
out of wood alone.


85
0:5:29,562 --> 0:5:31,431
They had to use steel frames


86
0:5:31,431 --> 0:5:33,599
inside much smaller wooden boats


87
0:5:33,599 --> 0:5:37,47
just to keep them afloat.


88
0:5:37,47 --> 0:5:41,341
The problem with a 450 foot boat
made of wood


89
0:5:41,341 --> 0:5:44,43
is that the wood as a material


90
0:5:44,43 --> 0:5:47,18
cannot maintain
the shape of the boat


91
0:5:47,18 --> 0:5:50,583
and the boat
would start to distort at sea,


92
0:5:50,583 --> 0:5:51,818
and the seams would open up


93
0:5:51,818 --> 0:5:56,489
and it would sink.


94
0:5:56,489 --> 0:5:58,491
It's a safe bet that the huge Ark


95
0:5:58,491 --> 0:6:0,86
would spring hundreds
of leaks along the length


96
0:6:0,86 --> 0:6:14,807
of its huge hull and sink
like a stone.


97
0:6:14,807 --> 0:6:17,543
That's not to say Noah
didn't build an ark.


98
0:6:17,543 --> 0:6:22,648
It's just that it would have
been much smaller.


99
0:6:22,648 --> 0:6:24,517
Then there's another problem.


100
0:6:24,517 --> 0:6:25,852
How could he cram two


101
0:6:25,852 --> 0:6:37,13
of every different kind of animal
into the ark?


102
0:6:37,13 --> 0:6:38,364
At the latest estimate,


103
0:6:38,364 --> 0:6:43,403
there are 30 million species
on earth.


104
0:6:43,403 --> 0:6:45,71
Even with a fleet of Arks,


105
0:6:45,71 --> 0:6:49,242
Noah would have struggled
to fit them all in.


106
0:6:49,242 --> 0:6:54,28
And how would he have gotten
the animals on board.


107
0:6:54,28 --> 0:6:56,416
Did he personally go
and fetch them?


108
0:6:56,416 --> 0:7:0,72
Or did they come to him?


109
0:7:0,72 --> 0:7:2,955
It is something Noah
would have had to consider


110
0:7:2,955 --> 0:7:7,86
especially since
he had a pressing deadline.


111
0:7:7,86 --> 0:7:11,3
Noah had just seven days to find
all the animals


112
0:7:11,3 --> 0:7:15,268
and get them on board.


113
0:7:15,268 --> 0:7:18,438
30 million species in a week.


114
0:7:18,438 --> 0:7:19,872
Noah would have needed
to load them


115
0:7:19,872 --> 0:7:23,709
at the rate of 50 pairs a second.


116
0:7:23,709 --> 0:7:26,279
But if one assumes
a more realistic loading rate then


117
0:7:26,279 --> 0:7:42,929
it would have taken Noah
at least 30 years.


118
0:7:42,929 --> 0:7:46,232
It may seem like
there's a stark choice:


119
0:7:46,232 --> 0:7:47,9
dismiss the story as myth,


120
0:7:47,9 --> 0:7:51,804
or appeal to the hand of God.


121
0:7:51,804 --> 0:7:56,209
But there may in fact
be another explanation.


122
0:7:56,209 --> 0:7:58,644
The instruction to load
'all the animals'


123
0:7:58,644 --> 0:8:0,88
could have referred only to
all the animals


124
0:8:0,88 --> 0:8:4,617
in Noah's part of the world.


125
0:8:4,617 --> 0:8:7,22
In fact,
the Book of Genesis specifies


126
0:8:7,22 --> 0:8:13,593
which animals Noah was to load.


127
0:8:13,593 --> 0:8:16,395
The same book
has a second set of instructions


128
0:8:16,395 --> 0:8:17,93
which are much less well known


129
0:8:17,93 --> 0:8:21,133
but present an even more
realistic scenario.


130
0:8:21,133 --> 0:8:23,769
Noah is told to take
'take seven pairs


131
0:8:23,769 --> 0:8:26,5
of clean animals'.


132
0:8:26,5 --> 0:8:28,14
Clean animals were
those considered suitable


133
0:8:28,14 --> 0:8:36,82
for ceremonial sacrifices to God.


134
0:8:36,82 --> 0:8:38,84
The Books of
Leviticus and Deuteronomy


135
0:8:38,84 --> 0:8:39,952
specify 10 such species


136
0:8:39,952 --> 0:8:41,721
including several types of sheep,


137
0:8:41,721 --> 0:8:43,322
antelopes plus cattle,


138
0:8:43,322 --> 0:8:45,958
goats and deer.


139
0:8:45,958 --> 0:8:50,29
Seven pairs of 10 species


140
0:8:50,29 --> 0:8:55,401
That's 140 animals.


141
0:8:55,401 --> 0:8:57,136
Then Noah is directed
to take a pair


142
0:8:57,136 --> 0:9:0,273
of each impure animal and bird.


143
0:9:0,273 --> 0:9:2,174
Again, The books of Leviticus


144
0:9:2,174 --> 0:9:5,678
and Deuteronomy list 30 or more.


145
0:9:5,678 --> 0:9:7,78
They include the pig, the hare,


146
0:9:7,78 --> 0:9:11,551
the lizard, the snail and so on.


147
0:9:11,551 --> 0:9:16,122
That's a further 60 animals.


148
0:9:16,122 --> 0:9:17,957
Then finally, Noah is told


149
0:9:17,957 --> 0:9:21,6
to load 'seven pairs
of the clean birds -


150
0:9:21,6 --> 0:9:25,865
like doves, ducks and cockerels.


151
0:9:25,865 --> 0:9:31,437
Adding all that up,
Noah had 260 animals.


152
0:9:31,437 --> 0:9:35,942
That's child's play compared
to 30 million -


153
0:9:35,942 --> 0:9:38,144
especially if you discount
the elephants,


154
0:9:38,144 --> 0:9:47,887
kangaroos and reluctant camels!


155
0:9:47,887 --> 0:9:50,856
A smaller Ark and fewer animals -


156
0:9:50,856 --> 0:9:55,428
suddenly the Noah story
looks more plausible.


157
0:9:55,428 --> 0:9:56,862
But the next part of the story


158
0:9:56,862 --> 0:10:2,134
may be most far fetched of all.


159
0:10:2,134 --> 0:10:4,87
Noah, the Ark, and the animals


160
0:10:4,87 --> 0:10:7,239
It's all meaningless
without the worst cataclysm


161
0:10:7,239 --> 0:10:25,224
in human history - the flood.


162
0:10:25,224 --> 0:10:26,792
According to the Bible


163
0:10:26,792 --> 0:10:34,533
it rained until the whole world
was covered in water.


164
0:10:34,533 --> 0:10:36,869
Such a catastrophe
should have left evidence


165
0:10:36,869 --> 0:10:38,337
all over the planet


166
0:10:38,337 --> 0:10:40,606
in the form of uniform
marine sediments


167
0:10:40,606 --> 0:10:46,646
spread across the earth
and the ocean floor.


168
0:10:46,646 --> 0:10:49,815
But have geologists
found any proof


169
0:10:49,815 --> 0:11:0,26
of a devastating global flood?


170
0:11:0,26 --> 0:11:1,36
The scientific quest


171
0:11:1,36 --> 0:11:3,496
for traces of the Biblical
global flood


172
0:11:3,496 --> 0:11:6,198
that Noah, his family
and the animals in the ark


173
0:11:6,198 --> 0:11:12,805
survived actually began
more than 150 years ago.


174
0:11:12,805 --> 0:11:14,94
But geologist Ian Plimer,


175
0:11:14,94 --> 0:11:16,842
after searching across continents


176
0:11:16,842 --> 0:11:19,879
sometimes in the most
extreme weather conditions


177
0:11:19,879 --> 0:11:23,15
has found very little evidence.


178
0:11:23,15 --> 0:11:25,184
A great flood
would leave a signature.


179
0:11:25,184 --> 0:11:28,154
It would be
a very very large signature


180
0:11:28,154 --> 0:11:30,556
apparent all over the world.


181
0:11:30,556 --> 0:11:32,591
There is no such signature.


182
0:11:32,591 --> 0:11:33,726
There's no evidence,


183
0:11:33,726 --> 0:11:36,262
in fact there is only
overwhelming evidence


184
0:11:36,262 --> 0:11:38,731
to the contrary.


185
0:11:38,731 --> 0:11:40,733
The absence of direct evidence


186
0:11:40,733 --> 0:11:43,869
is only one of the problems
with the story


187
0:11:43,869 --> 0:11:46,205
The whole idea
of a global flood flies


188
0:11:46,205 --> 0:11:50,91
in the face of what is known
about planet earth.


189
0:11:50,91 --> 0:11:52,611
To flood the entire planet


190
0:11:52,611 --> 0:11:55,347
to the top of the Himalayas
would take three times


191
0:11:55,347 --> 0:11:59,51
the volume of water in the oceans.


192
0:11:59,51 --> 0:12:0,19
It's hard to imagine


193
0:12:0,19 --> 0:12:2,955
where such a deluge
could come from.


194
0:12:2,955 --> 0:12:6,592
The Bible provides some clues.


195
0:12:6,592 --> 0:12:11,797
It says it rained for forty days
and forty nights -


196
0:12:11,797 --> 0:12:16,702
but even non-stop that's not enough.


197
0:12:16,702 --> 0:12:19,705
We know how much water
we've got in the oceans,


198
0:12:19,705 --> 0:12:22,408
we know how much water's
in the polar ice caps.


199
0:12:22,408 --> 0:12:24,31
We know how much water
is in the atmosphere


200
0:12:24,31 --> 0:12:27,46
and we know how much water
is in the rocks.


201
0:12:27,46 --> 0:12:28,881
If we put all of that together,


202
0:12:28,881 --> 0:12:31,584
which has happened many times
in the geological past,


203
0:12:31,584 --> 0:12:48,667
we still do not
flood the continents.


204
0:12:48,667 --> 0:12:51,36
If rainfall couldn't deliver
enough water,


205
0:12:51,36 --> 0:12:52,705
what could?


206
0:12:52,705 --> 0:12:57,42
The Bible offers
one more possibility -


207
0:12:57,42 --> 0:13:0,112
'deep springs'.


208
0:13:0,112 --> 0:13:1,947
The Book of Genesis says ''


209
0:13:1,947 --> 0:13:6,318
All the springs of the great
deep broke through''


210
0:13:6,318 --> 0:13:8,22
Could the great flood
have gushed out


211
0:13:8,22 --> 0:13:17,763
of the centre of the earth?


212
0:13:17,763 --> 0:13:20,566
It's an impossibility to have that
much amount of water


213
0:13:20,566 --> 0:13:25,171
coming out of springs,
fountains or geysers.


214
0:13:25,171 --> 0:13:29,208
If all of that water was
in the earth and in the crust


215
0:13:29,208 --> 0:13:32,912
then well before it had been
released as geysers


216
0:13:32,912 --> 0:13:34,613
the crust would have
been quicksand,


217
0:13:34,613 --> 0:13:38,117
you couldn't have walked.


218
0:13:38,117 --> 0:13:40,753
Even if the flood had been caused
by a miracle


219
0:13:40,753 --> 0:13:42,788
Noah, his family and the animals


220
0:13:42,788 --> 0:13:46,458
would have faced
further problems...


221
0:13:46,458 --> 0:13:48,894
The amount of water flooding
the surface of the planet


222
0:13:48,894 --> 0:13:56,869
would have changed
the earth's atmosphere.


223
0:13:56,869 --> 0:13:59,538
The atmosphere would have
had a huge amount


224
0:13:59,538 --> 0:14:1,54
of water vapour dissolved in it,


225
0:14:1,54 --> 0:14:5,311
so much so that you
would have drowned by breathing.


226
0:14:5,311 --> 0:14:7,613
And so much so
that atmospheric pressure


227
0:14:7,613 --> 0:14:11,16
would have crushed your lungs.


228
0:14:11,16 --> 0:14:14,587
Geysers present another
potentially fatal problem.


229
0:14:14,587 --> 0:14:16,121
They release poisonous gases


230
0:14:16,121 --> 0:14:17,69
from deep within the earth's core


231
0:14:17,69 --> 0:14:19,692
which probably
would have killed everybody,


232
0:14:19,692 --> 0:14:23,162
whether or not they were
in the Ark.


233
0:14:23,162 --> 0:14:25,364
Geysers pump out huge amounts


234
0:14:25,364 --> 0:14:27,7
of noxious sulphur rich gasses.


235
0:14:27,7 --> 0:14:29,635
Even before the flood


236
0:14:29,635 --> 0:14:46,318
you could not have breathed.


237
0:14:46,318 --> 0:14:49,88
If nothing on Earth
could cause the flood -


238
0:14:49,88 --> 0:14:51,957
how about something from space.


239
0:14:51,957 --> 0:14:54,86
Like a comet.


240
0:14:54,86 --> 0:15:1,2
They contain vast amounts
of frozen water.


241
0:15:1,2 --> 0:15:3,2
But to flood the entire planet


242
0:15:3,2 --> 0:15:6,972
the comet would have
to be 1000 miles wide,


243
0:15:6,972 --> 0:15:10,509
or as big as Brazil.


244
0:15:10,509 --> 0:15:12,912
And if a comet that size
hit the earth,


245
0:15:12,912 --> 0:15:17,616
not many people would live
to worry about a flood.


246
0:15:17,616 --> 0:15:20,452
The friction caused
by the comet's forced entry


247
0:15:20,452 --> 0:15:22,187
into the earth's outer atmosphere


248
0:15:22,187 --> 0:15:24,823
and its impact as it struck earth


249
0:15:24,823 --> 0:15:34,333
would be equivalent
to 12 trillion megatons of TNT -


250
0:15:34,333 --> 0:15:39,238
the biggest explosion of all time


251
0:15:39,238 --> 0:15:42,274
Comets carry water,
they are dirty ice.


252
0:15:42,274 --> 0:15:45,377
As they come into the atmosphere,
they explode,


253
0:15:45,377 --> 0:15:50,282
there are massive shock waves.


254
0:15:50,282 --> 0:15:55,721
Massive areas of forest wiped out,


255
0:15:55,721 --> 0:16:0,192
huge extinctions of life
from a comet


256
0:16:0,192 --> 0:16:2,27
The comet's devastating impact


257
0:16:2,27 --> 0:16:4,129
would force the temperature
of the atmosphere


258
0:16:4,129 --> 0:16:11,971
to rise
to 12000 degrees Fahrenheit -


259
0:16:11,971 --> 0:16:18,31
hotter than the surface of the sun.


260
0:16:18,31 --> 0:16:25,718
We would have had no life
to go onto an Ark.


261
0:16:25,718 --> 0:16:27,353
Noah, his family


262
0:16:27,353 --> 0:16:29,388
and all the animals two by two


263
0:16:29,388 --> 0:16:31,49
would have been fried to charcoal


264
0:16:31,49 --> 0:16:43,936
before the whole flood started


265
0:16:43,936 --> 0:16:45,471
End of story?


266
0:16:45,471 --> 0:16:54,847
Not quite.


267
0:16:54,847 --> 0:16:56,181
According to the Bible,


268
0:16:56,181 --> 0:16:58,917
Noah's Ark landed
in the mountains of Ararat,


269
0:16:58,917 --> 0:17:2,788
today in Eastern Turkey.


270
0:17:2,788 --> 0:17:4,623
The earth was revealed at last


271
0:17:4,623 --> 0:17:6,58
and the animals disembarked


272
0:17:6,58 --> 0:17:13,465
after months below decks
to repopulate the world.


273
0:17:13,465 --> 0:17:18,203
So are there any remains of the ark?


274
0:17:18,203 --> 0:17:20,172
The problem is that the evidence -


275
0:17:20,172 --> 0:17:39,258
wood, rots in a matter of centuries.


276
0:17:39,258 --> 0:17:42,194
Countless expeditions have been
drawn to Mount Ararat


277
0:17:42,194 --> 0:17:46,298
seeking to discover
the ark's resting place.


278
0:17:46,298 --> 0:17:48,901
There are no obvious
remains of the ark


279
0:17:48,901 --> 0:17:53,38
on the slopes of Mount Ararat


280
0:17:53,38 --> 0:17:56,108
This hasn't stopped
a thriving tourist industry -


281
0:17:56,108 --> 0:17:58,811
pilgrims, ark hunters and locals -


282
0:17:58,811 --> 0:18:0,846
convinced that
they will find the remains


283
0:18:0,846 --> 0:18:6,618
of the Ark somewhere
on the mountain.


284
0:18:6,618 --> 0:18:8,787
One French expedition in the 50s


285
0:18:8,787 --> 0:18:11,156
did in fact find an ancient
looking piece of wood


286
0:18:11,156 --> 0:18:18,664
12000 ft up in a glacier.


287
0:18:18,664 --> 0:18:19,832
As a geologist,


288
0:18:19,832 --> 0:18:23,268
Ian Plimer wanted to find out more.


289
0:18:23,268 --> 0:18:26,171
He knew that for the timber
to be part of Noah's Ark,


290
0:18:26,171 --> 0:18:32,478
it would need to be dated
to around 3000BC.


291
0:18:32,478 --> 0:18:34,379
When this piece of wood was found


292
0:18:34,379 --> 0:18:36,682
it was thought to be the clue,


293
0:18:36,682 --> 0:18:39,918
this is what we need to show
we have Noah's Ark


294
0:18:39,918 --> 0:18:42,454
and so they took the wood to date it


295
0:18:42,454 --> 0:18:43,722
and you can date wood


296
0:18:43,722 --> 0:18:48,327
by measuring tree rings
or by carbon dating.


297
0:18:48,327 --> 0:18:50,195
It wasn't old enough.


298
0:18:50,195 --> 0:18:52,297
The wood
was from the eighth century,


299
0:18:52,297 --> 0:18:55,67
4000 years after Noah's time.


300
0:18:55,67 --> 0:18:59,271
But what was the wood
doing on the slopes of Ararat?


301
0:18:59,271 --> 0:19:1,306
The wood would have
been transported there


302
0:19:1,306 --> 0:19:2,608
to build a structure -


303
0:19:2,608 --> 0:19:3,809
something like a church.


304
0:19:3,809 --> 0:19:6,178
There is a booming ark
business there now,


305
0:19:6,178 --> 0:19:7,513
there was in the past.


306
0:19:7,513 --> 0:19:11,717
It certainly didn't come from Noah


307
0:19:11,717 --> 0:19:13,51
But just as Ararat


308
0:19:13,51 --> 0:19:15,587
was looking like a false trail
for ark hunters,


309
0:19:15,587 --> 0:19:24,53
this ancient mountain came up
with a new twist.


310
0:19:24,53 --> 0:19:27,699
In 1949, US Air Force planes


311
0:19:27,699 --> 0:19:31,47
photographed the summit
of Mt Ararat.


312
0:19:31,47 --> 0:19:32,938
Rumours began to spread


313
0:19:32,938 --> 0:19:37,509
that they'd spotted a boat structure
in the ice.


314
0:19:37,509 --> 0:19:43,248
For decades the CIA
withheld the pictures.


315
0:19:43,248 --> 0:19:45,651
But then through
the Freedom of Information


316
0:19:45,651 --> 0:19:53,458
Act the CIA finally released
the photos in 1995.


317
0:19:53,458 --> 0:19:55,93
At first there's nothing


318
0:19:55,93 --> 0:19:59,198
in the CIA picture
to suggest a boat.


319
0:19:59,198 --> 0:20:0,766
But look closely,


320
0:20:0,766 --> 0:20:2,434
you can see a huge dark shape


321
0:20:2,434 --> 0:20:4,469
sticking out of the ice-cap.


322
0:20:4,469 --> 0:20:7,139
It's about 450 feet long -


323
0:20:7,139 --> 0:20:10,342
the right length for the Ark.


324
0:20:10,342 --> 0:20:12,477
The anomaly
has tantalised ark hunters


325
0:20:12,477 --> 0:20:14,58
since the pictures were released.


326
0:20:14,58 --> 0:20:19,718
But geologists remain unconvinced.


327
0:20:19,718 --> 0:20:23,121
It's such a poor
quality grainy image


328
0:20:23,121 --> 0:20:28,227
that it's very hard to tell whether
it's an Ark or chicken entrails.


329
0:20:28,227 --> 0:20:30,862
You can see dark shapes
anywhere from the air,


330
0:20:30,862 --> 0:20:33,131
be they in ice or on the ground.


331
0:20:33,131 --> 0:20:35,701
Some of them are ark shaped,
others are not.


332
0:20:35,701 --> 0:20:37,436
It's not at all convincing


333
0:20:37,436 --> 0:20:41,573
from one single
poor quality photograph.


334
0:20:41,573 --> 0:20:44,142
But hopes were raised again
in the year 2000


335
0:20:44,142 --> 0:20:48,48
with new pin-sharp satellite
images of the strange shape.


336
0:20:48,48 --> 0:20:50,282
This one shows a snow ledge


337
0:20:50,282 --> 0:20:54,219
believed by ark hunters
to conceal a boat-shaped outline.


338
0:20:54,219 --> 0:20:56,555
But for Ian Plimer
this is just another


339
0:20:56,555 --> 0:21:0,325
of nature's random shapes.


340
0:21:0,325 --> 0:21:1,927
Well this is a fabulous photograph


341
0:21:1,927 --> 0:21:4,896
Far better resolution
than the CIA photograph.


342
0:21:4,896 --> 0:21:7,933
However we see nothing
spectacular here.


343
0:21:7,933 --> 0:21:13,839
All we see is evidence of retreating
and advancing ice


344
0:21:13,839 --> 0:21:16,875
In fact, all the geological
evidence indicates


345
0:21:16,875 --> 0:21:19,11
that an ark
could not have remained frozen


346
0:21:19,11 --> 0:21:21,813
in a glacier for long.


347
0:21:21,813 --> 0:21:24,16
The ice is constantly
pushing material


348
0:21:24,16 --> 0:21:25,851
I down the slopes of Mount Ararat


349
0:21:25,851 --> 0:21:28,387
and ultimately taken any ark


350
0:21:28,387 --> 0:21:30,589
that might have been
there to the bottom.


351
0:21:30,589 --> 0:21:33,625
It would have spat it out
as all glaciers do,


352
0:21:33,625 --> 0:21:35,93
as they move down slope


353
0:21:35,93 --> 0:21:37,396
anything they pick up they spit out.


354
0:21:37,396 --> 0:21:43,1
Be it rocks, be it Arks.


355
0:21:43,1 --> 0:21:45,537
In addition to fragments of wood
and photos


356
0:21:45,537 --> 0:21:50,275
there are dozens of
alleged sightings of the ark.


357
0:21:50,275 --> 0:21:52,244
Biblical scholar Lloyd Bailey
has made


358
0:21:52,244 --> 0:21:54,98
an exhaustive analysis
of all the claims


359
0:21:54,98 --> 0:21:58,784
and found them to be false.


360
0:21:58,784 --> 0:22:0,752
An amazing amount of evidence


361
0:22:0,752 --> 0:22:2,621
has been produced by ark searchers


362
0:22:2,621 --> 0:22:5,857
in support of the ark
having landed there.


363
0:22:5,857 --> 0:22:8,293
But photographs are alleged to exist


364
0:22:8,293 --> 0:22:9,761
but you can't find them.


365
0:22:9,761 --> 0:22:11,33
Newspaper articles of sightings


366
0:22:11,33 --> 0:22:15,3
are alleged to exist
but they are lost.


367
0:22:15,3 --> 0:22:18,503
They want desperately to be
able to support the Bible


368
0:22:18,503 --> 0:22:23,475
in an age of doubt,
in a modern rational age.


369
0:22:23,475 --> 0:22:25,377
And that desire is so strong


370
0:22:25,377 --> 0:22:27,279
they can rationalise away


371
0:22:27,279 --> 0:22:30,349
the overwhelming evidence that
there is no boat there


372
0:22:30,349 --> 0:22:36,221
and no evidence whatsoever
that there ever has been.


373
0:22:36,221 --> 0:22:37,789
The traditional Noah story


374
0:22:37,789 --> 0:22:41,893
may not pass
a rational historical test.


375
0:22:41,893 --> 0:22:53,872
But maybe it was never meant to.


376
0:22:53,872 --> 0:22:56,308
Biblical scholars -
using clues in the language


377
0:22:56,308 --> 0:22:57,476
used by the Bible -


378
0:22:57,476 --> 0:22:59,277
are agreed that the story of Noah


379
0:22:59,277 --> 0:23:0,679
was physically written down


380
0:23:0,679 --> 0:23:4,85
in the 6th century BC.


381
0:23:4,85 --> 0:23:7,185
The scribes who wrote it
were Jewish priests


382
0:23:7,185 --> 0:23:9,154
who were in exile in Babylon -


383
0:23:9,154 --> 0:23:13,24
today modern Iraq.


384
0:23:13,24 --> 0:23:15,761
Maybe they sat down one day
to make up


385
0:23:15,761 --> 0:23:18,29
a cautionary tale about what happens


386
0:23:18,29 --> 0:23:22,834
when people disobey God.


387
0:23:22,834 --> 0:23:24,69
But it's said


388
0:23:24,69 --> 0:23:28,907
that all stories
have some seeds of truth.


389
0:23:28,907 --> 0:23:32,21
Maybe the Noah story
is an exaggeration,


390
0:23:32,21 --> 0:23:39,451
an embellishment of something
that really happened.


391
0:23:39,451 --> 0:23:41,386
150 years ago,


392
0:23:41,386 --> 0:23:44,89
archaeologists made some
extraordinary finds


393
0:23:44,89 --> 0:23:45,557
in Iraq.


394
0:23:45,557 --> 0:23:48,86
Evidence that would re-write
the famous story about Noah


395
0:23:48,86 --> 0:24:6,478
and his ark full of animals.


396
0:24:6,478 --> 0:24:7,813
In 1851,


397
0:24:7,813 --> 0:24:9,781
British archaeologist
Sir Henry Layard


398
0:24:9,781 --> 0:24:10,982
explored the ruins


399
0:24:10,982 --> 0:24:30,68
of the Babylonian library
of Ninevah.


400
0:24:30,68 --> 0:24:32,938
His finds were a breakthrough -


401
0:24:32,938 --> 0:24:34,539
hundreds of clay tablets -


402
0:24:34,539 --> 0:24:38,176
of all sizes and shapes.


403
0:24:38,176 --> 0:24:40,111
They may have held vital clues


404
0:24:40,111 --> 0:24:43,515
about the Noah story.


405
0:24:43,515 --> 0:24:44,583
The trouble was,


406
0:24:44,583 --> 0:24:49,921
Sir Henry couldn't decipher
the ancient Babylonian script.


407
0:24:49,921 --> 0:24:51,323
So he packed the tablets


408
0:24:51,323 --> 0:24:52,991
and sent them off to London -


409
0:24:52,991 --> 0:24:54,526
to the British Museum -


410
0:24:54,526 --> 0:25:6,37
to be deciphered by experts.


411
0:25:6,37 --> 0:25:8,139
The museum staff
had no idea about


412
0:25:8,139 --> 0:25:13,945
the sensational information
encrypted in the tablets.


413
0:25:13,945 --> 0:25:16,281
So they languished
in their vaults for years


414
0:25:16,281 --> 0:25:18,183
until 1872


415
0:25:18,183 --> 0:25:19,651
when they came to the attention


416
0:25:19,651 --> 0:25:25,357
of museum assistant George Smith.


417
0:25:25,357 --> 0:25:27,993
Dr Irving Finkel today
runs the department


418
0:25:27,993 --> 0:25:29,194
in the British Museum


419
0:25:29,194 --> 0:25:32,831
where George Smith worked.


420
0:25:32,831 --> 0:25:36,301
Smith had a peculiar quality
tantamount to genius


421
0:25:36,301 --> 0:25:38,36
which meant he could look
at a cuneiform tablet


422
0:25:38,36 --> 0:25:39,471
and know what it was about,


423
0:25:39,471 --> 0:25:40,539
more than anybody else


424
0:25:40,539 --> 0:25:42,24
before him and probably
anybody else since.


425
0:25:42,24 --> 0:25:44,242
And he wasn't
a trained phrenologist,


426
0:25:44,242 --> 0:25:46,77
he know a bit of Hebrew,
he knew a bit of Arabic,


427
0:25:46,77 --> 0:25:47,879
he could look things up
in the dictionary


428
0:25:47,879 --> 0:25:49,948
but he just had
this amazing quality that


429
0:25:49,948 --> 0:25:51,416
he could look at a bit of clay


430
0:25:51,416 --> 0:25:53,251
which to everybody else
looks like a dog biscuit


431
0:25:53,251 --> 0:25:54,886
and know what the words meant.


432
0:25:54,886 --> 0:25:56,855
And he was the person
in our Department


433
0:25:56,855 --> 0:26:0,358
who read about the flood
for the first time.


434
0:26:0,358 --> 0:26:2,794
What George Smith discovered
among the tablets


435
0:26:2,794 --> 0:26:5,497
was an ancient story
about a great flood -


436
0:26:5,497 --> 0:26:7,532
the Epic of Gilgamesh.


437
0:26:7,532 --> 0:26:9,334
It was a breakthrough
Smith himself


438
0:26:9,334 --> 0:26:11,836
could barely comprehend.


439
0:26:11,836 --> 0:26:14,39
The impact on him was something


440
0:26:14,39 --> 0:26:16,341
that he could hardly control.


441
0:26:16,341 --> 0:26:19,11
He dropped the tablet back
into the tray like this,


442
0:26:19,11 --> 0:26:21,479
and started to run holding his head


443
0:26:21,479 --> 0:26:23,214
and making funny noises


444
0:26:23,214 --> 0:26:25,951
and according to the narrative
that is recorded


445
0:26:25,951 --> 0:26:28,52
he started even to take
his clothes off in his agitation


446
0:26:28,52 --> 0:26:30,855
because he was the first person
after all that time,


447
0:26:30,855 --> 0:26:32,624
to read this funny writing
and see that


448
0:26:32,624 --> 0:26:35,193
there was to all intents
and purposes the text


449
0:26:35,193 --> 0:26:36,428
that everybody knew from the Bible


450
0:26:36,428 --> 0:26:38,663
and it was just too much
for him to tolerate,


451
0:26:38,663 --> 0:26:42,4
he just nearly went crazy.


452
0:26:42,4 --> 0:26:45,136
What seemed to upset him so much
were the similarities


453
0:26:45,136 --> 0:26:52,544
between the stories
of Gilgamesh and Noah


454
0:26:52,544 --> 0:27:1,353
''The great gods decided
to make a deluge ''


455
0:27:1,353 --> 0:27:6,191
''Build a boat...''


456
0:27:6,191 --> 0:27:20,405
''Take into the boat the seed
of all living things...''


457
0:27:20,405 --> 0:27:22,173
Irving Finkel has a theory


458
0:27:22,173 --> 0:27:26,77
why George Smith behaved
so oddly that fateful day.


459
0:27:26,77 --> 0:27:28,46
The sheer excitement
might have triggered


460
0:27:28,46 --> 0:27:31,383
some sort of brain seizure.


461
0:27:31,383 --> 0:27:33,385
I was reading something
about the history of epilepsy where


462
0:27:33,385 --> 0:27:35,62
this phenomenon was described


463
0:27:35,62 --> 0:27:37,22
as a particular kind of epilepsy,


464
0:27:37,22 --> 0:27:38,256
making this funny noise


465
0:27:38,256 --> 0:27:40,992
and trying to disrobe yourself
in the agitation


466
0:27:40,992 --> 0:27:43,628
of having an epileptic
fit of some kind,


467
0:27:43,628 --> 0:27:44,763
And it did occur to me


468
0:27:44,763 --> 0:27:47,232
to wonder whether
shock that hit him,


469
0:27:47,232 --> 0:27:49,434
the real shock
might not have triggered


470
0:27:49,434 --> 0:28:3,281
something of that kind.


471
0:28:3,281 --> 0:28:6,17
Since then yet more accounts
of the flood story


472
0:28:6,17 --> 0:28:7,485
were unearthed in Iraq -


473
0:28:7,485 --> 0:28:9,521
confirming that
the story first emerged


474
0:28:9,521 --> 0:28:11,222
in ancient Mesopotamia -


475
0:28:11,222 --> 0:28:12,824
the place where the great Sumerian,


476
0:28:12,824 --> 0:28:20,765
Assyrian and Babylonian
civilisations were born.


477
0:28:20,765 --> 0:28:23,34
The ancient flood stories
had different names


478
0:28:23,34 --> 0:28:26,504
and were written at different times


479
0:28:26,504 --> 0:28:29,7
but they all pointed to
a common ancestor


480
0:28:29,7 --> 0:28:32,21
composed some 5000 years ago -


481
0:28:32,21 --> 0:28:37,982
one original story
about a disastrous flood.


482
0:28:37,982 --> 0:28:40,652
It is very likely
that the biblical story


483
0:28:40,652 --> 0:28:43,354
has a Mesopotamian prototype


484
0:28:43,354 --> 0:28:45,523
because they are so similar,


485
0:28:45,523 --> 0:28:47,258
in both cases the gods have decided


486
0:28:47,258 --> 0:28:48,76
to destroy the human race


487
0:28:48,76 --> 0:28:51,62
they do so by a great flood,


488
0:28:51,62 --> 0:28:53,164
one family survives in a boat,


489
0:28:53,164 --> 0:28:55,166
they take on board animals,


490
0:28:55,166 --> 0:28:59,27
they disembark and then
they repopulate the earth.


491
0:28:59,27 --> 0:29:1,206
One of the oldest flood narratives -


492
0:29:1,206 --> 0:29:2,64
The epic of Atra-hasis


493
0:29:2,64 --> 0:29:5,443
written before the more famous
epic of Gilgamesh -


494
0:29:5,443 --> 0:29:8,12
was discovered only recently.


495
0:29:8,12 --> 0:29:10,381
Alan Millard found it
while sifting through


496
0:29:10,381 --> 0:29:13,284
the British Museum's
backlog of clay tablets.


497
0:29:13,284 --> 0:29:14,686
It made him wonder -


498
0:29:14,686 --> 0:29:19,591
perhaps the Bible
never meant a global deluge.


499
0:29:19,591 --> 0:29:23,294
The ancient Hebrew language
has one word for land


500
0:29:23,294 --> 0:29:28,32
and country and earth
and it's easy to suppose


501
0:29:28,32 --> 0:29:29,601
that means the whole earth


502
0:29:29,601 --> 0:29:31,603
but it certainly need not.


503
0:29:31,603 --> 0:29:34,72
And I think that
it was a local flood


504
0:29:34,72 --> 0:29:39,177
that is described there.


505
0:29:39,177 --> 0:29:41,45
The discovery
of these older versions


506
0:29:41,45 --> 0:29:45,183
of Noah's story
raised a tantalising possibility.


507
0:29:45,183 --> 0:29:48,887
What if they had been inspired
by an actual flood?


508
0:29:48,887 --> 0:29:50,588
Not a global deluge,


509
0:29:50,588 --> 0:29:55,86
but a regional flood
in Mesopotamia?


510
0:29:55,86 --> 0:29:57,295
In the 1930s


511
0:29:57,295 --> 0:30:13,978
archaeologists returned to Iraq
to find out.


512
0:30:13,978 --> 0:30:15,38
In 1931,


513
0:30:15,38 --> 0:30:16,781
a team of archaeologists


514
0:30:16,781 --> 0:30:19,184
led by Leonard Woolley
and his wife Katherine


515
0:30:19,184 --> 0:30:20,485
were excavating the ruins


516
0:30:20,485 --> 0:30:27,58
of the ancient Mesopotamian
city of Ur.


517
0:30:27,58 --> 0:30:29,894
The Woolleys were a colourful
husband and wife team -


518
0:30:29,894 --> 0:30:31,529
friends of Lawrence of Arabia -


519
0:30:31,529 --> 0:30:38,67
and of Agatha Christie the novelist.


520
0:30:38,67 --> 0:30:41,206
They left a detailed record
of their finds


521
0:30:41,206 --> 0:30:44,75
revealing that they dug
five to six thousand years


522
0:30:44,75 --> 0:30:45,543
into the past -


523
0:30:45,543 --> 0:30:53,885
the right time frame
for the Noah story.


524
0:30:53,885 --> 0:30:55,62
One day his workmen struck


525
0:30:55,62 --> 0:30:57,622
an unusual layer of soil -


526
0:30:57,622 --> 0:30:59,991
one that could only have
been deposited


527
0:30:59,991 --> 0:31:3,695
by water.


528
0:31:3,695 --> 0:31:5,163
When the soil was analysed


529
0:31:5,163 --> 0:31:6,364
it showed that the silt


530
0:31:6,364 --> 0:31:10,902
had been deposited by river water.


531
0:31:10,902 --> 0:31:14,505
Now, Mesopotamia suffered
regular seasonal floods.


532
0:31:14,505 --> 0:31:17,442
But this was a massive layer -


533
0:31:17,442 --> 0:31:24,816
something out of the ordinary.


534
0:31:24,816 --> 0:31:27,518
In fact,
later archaeological excavations


535
0:31:27,518 --> 0:31:28,853
of ancient city streets


536
0:31:28,853 --> 0:31:30,989
show that five thousand years ago


537
0:31:30,989 --> 0:31:33,258
at least three Mesopotamian towns


538
0:31:33,258 --> 0:31:40,465
were hit by large river floods.


539
0:31:40,465 --> 0:31:42,934
So Leonard Woolley and his wife


540
0:31:42,934 --> 0:31:45,303
had hit the jackpot.


541
0:31:45,303 --> 0:31:47,338
There had been a massive flood


542
0:31:47,338 --> 0:31:49,941
in ancient Mesopotamia after all.


543
0:31:49,941 --> 0:31:53,244
It was - conclusive proof -
a real story


544
0:31:53,244 --> 0:32:7,625
lay behind the Biblical
and Babylonian epics


545
0:32:7,625 --> 0:32:9,46
In committing the story to writing,


546
0:32:9,46 --> 0:32:11,729
the Sumerian scribes
may have embellished it


547
0:32:11,729 --> 0:32:14,666
with myths and supernatural events.


548
0:32:14,666 --> 0:32:17,602
But there are plenty
of practical details too,


549
0:32:17,602 --> 0:32:20,104
and they are priceless
in reconstructing a story


550
0:32:20,104 --> 0:32:24,8
that's historically plausible.


551
0:32:24,8 --> 0:32:32,951
However,
it does mean starting afresh


552
0:32:32,951 --> 0:32:34,285
It means setting aside


553
0:32:34,285 --> 0:32:39,357
the storybook image
of the huge Ark,


554
0:32:39,357 --> 0:32:41,893
the global deluge,


555
0:32:41,893 --> 0:32:44,462
the number of animals


556
0:32:44,462 --> 0:32:48,733
and the landing on Mt Ararat.


557
0:32:48,733 --> 0:32:51,202
Above all it means abandoning


558
0:32:51,202 --> 0:32:53,705
the familiar Biblical
image of Noah,


559
0:32:53,705 --> 0:32:55,974
and introducing
a very different image


560
0:32:55,974 --> 0:32:57,942
of what he might have
actually looked like


561
0:32:57,942 --> 0:33:5,516
and how he might have lived.


562
0:33:5,516 --> 0:33:7,552
Archaeological finds
have established


563
0:33:7,552 --> 0:33:11,289
that the Noah story may actually
have happened in Sumeria -


564
0:33:11,289 --> 0:33:16,928
an ancient civilisation
in what is now Iraq.


565
0:33:16,928 --> 0:33:18,563
The Babylonian accounts say


566
0:33:18,563 --> 0:33:22,867
that the story begins
in the city of Shuruppak.


567
0:33:22,867 --> 0:33:27,972
This was the cradle of civilisation.


568
0:33:27,972 --> 0:33:29,941
The Sumerians invented writing,


569
0:33:29,941 --> 0:33:34,78
the wheel and accounting.


570
0:33:34,78 --> 0:33:35,98
And what is known
of Sumerian culture


571
0:33:35,98 --> 0:33:38,75
offers the first glimpse
of the historical figure


572
0:33:38,75 --> 0:33:42,22
behind the flood stories.


573
0:33:42,22 --> 0:33:45,656
The most obvious difference
is how Noah looked.


574
0:33:45,656 --> 0:33:47,592
Forget the man in Biblical robes


575
0:33:47,592 --> 0:33:51,362
and imagine instead a Sumerian
from head to toe -


576
0:33:51,362 --> 0:33:52,597
wearing eye make-up,


577
0:33:52,597 --> 0:33:57,902
with a bald head and even a kilt!


578
0:33:57,902 --> 0:34:0,471
Then there's what he did
for a living.


579
0:34:0,471 --> 0:34:1,906
The Epic of Gilgamesh says


580
0:34:1,906 --> 0:34:5,343
the Sumerian Noah
owned silver and gold.


581
0:34:5,343 --> 0:34:6,811
Five thousand years ago,


582
0:34:6,811 --> 0:34:9,247
these were the currency
of wealthy merchants,


583
0:34:9,247 --> 0:34:11,349
suggesting that the Sumerian Noah


584
0:34:11,349 --> 0:34:13,684
was not a farmer or a wine grower


585
0:34:13,684 --> 0:34:17,355
but a businessman.


586
0:34:17,355 --> 0:34:19,891
Instead of an Ark
to survive the flood,


587
0:34:19,891 --> 0:34:21,659
the Sumerian Noah is more likely


588
0:34:21,659 --> 0:34:24,162
to have built a boat
to make money -


589
0:34:24,162 --> 0:34:31,636
hauling grain, beer and animals.


590
0:34:31,636 --> 0:34:33,204
All the big trading centres -


591
0:34:33,204 --> 0:34:34,839
like the great city of Ur -


592
0:34:34,839 --> 0:34:36,908
lay on the Euphrates.


593
0:34:36,908 --> 0:34:39,277
It was cheaper to take cargo
on river barges


594
0:34:39,277 --> 0:34:56,327
than by overland caravans.


595
0:34:56,327 --> 0:34:58,696
The question is how big a barge


596
0:34:58,696 --> 0:35:1,732
did this Noah have?


597
0:35:1,732 --> 0:35:5,36
The Sumerians used a variety
of boats on the Euphrates,


598
0:35:5,36 --> 0:35:6,437
from small reed canoes,


599
0:35:6,437 --> 0:35:9,74
to wooden ones 20 feet long.


600
0:35:9,74 --> 0:35:11,742
But the Babylonian sources agree


601
0:35:11,742 --> 0:35:16,414
the flood boat
was much bigger than those.


602
0:35:16,414 --> 0:35:18,649
There was an obvious incentive
for merchants


603
0:35:18,649 --> 0:35:22,887
to build the biggest commercial
river barge possible.


604
0:35:22,887 --> 0:35:27,625
But they would have been limited
by the technology available.


605
0:35:27,625 --> 0:35:30,828
No remains or inscriptions
of large Sumerian boats


606
0:35:30,828 --> 0:35:32,663
have been found yet.


607
0:35:32,663 --> 0:35:35,166
So instead marine archaeologists


608
0:35:35,166 --> 0:35:36,868
have asked how big a boat


609
0:35:36,868 --> 0:35:38,769
could the Sumerians have built


610
0:35:38,769 --> 0:35:51,115
with the available know how?


611
0:35:51,115 --> 0:35:52,25
One simple solution


612
0:35:52,25 --> 0:35:57,388
would have been to tie
smaller boats together.


613
0:35:57,388 --> 0:35:59,924
Marine archaeologist
Tom Vosmer believes


614
0:35:59,924 --> 0:36:4,28
there are clues to this effect
in the Epic of Gilgamesh.


615
0:36:4,28 --> 0:36:8,933
It says that the boat
was divided in sections.


616
0:36:8,933 --> 0:36:10,501
Probably one
of the best ways to do


617
0:36:10,501 --> 0:36:14,605
it would be to build it in units
such as the size of this,


618
0:36:14,605 --> 0:36:16,541
and use it as a pontoon


619
0:36:16,541 --> 0:36:20,945
in a river barge actually
held together,


620
0:36:20,945 --> 0:36:23,247
lash them together, with some rope
and heavy timbers


621
0:36:23,247 --> 0:36:26,25
and then they could build the ark
on top of that.


622
0:36:26,25 --> 0:36:27,685
And it was probably a system


623
0:36:27,685 --> 0:36:41,566
that could have been used
on the rivers quite easily.


624
0:36:41,566 --> 0:36:44,235
Since the historical Ark
was a cargo vessel,


625
0:36:44,235 --> 0:36:46,871
it's easy to say
what the Sumerian Noah


626
0:36:46,871 --> 0:36:51,342
loaded on to his barge.


627
0:36:51,342 --> 0:36:53,978
Forget the animals marching
two by two


628
0:36:53,978 --> 0:36:57,48
and think instead
of Noah loading animals,


629
0:36:57,48 --> 0:37:2,987
grain and beer for sale.


630
0:37:2,987 --> 0:37:4,288
Even for a rich merchant,


631
0:37:4,288 --> 0:37:5,59
it's quite an undertaking


632
0:37:5,59 --> 0:37:8,759
to mastermind
such a big construction.


633
0:37:8,759 --> 0:37:11,229
But according
to the Babylonian sources,


634
0:37:11,229 --> 0:37:24,442
Noah had more than
just wealth on his side.


635
0:37:24,442 --> 0:37:29,38
They say Noah was the king
of the city of Shuruppak,


636
0:37:29,38 --> 0:37:31,649
but he wasn't above the law.


637
0:37:31,649 --> 0:37:33,284
Failure to deliver his cargo


638
0:37:33,284 --> 0:37:36,254
would have meant social
and financial ruin for Noah,


639
0:37:36,254 --> 0:37:39,9
whether he was king or not.


640
0:37:39,9 --> 0:37:42,86
In Sumeria anyone who failed
to pay their debts -


641
0:37:42,86 --> 0:37:44,662
including kings -


642
0:37:44,662 --> 0:37:49,767
was liable to end up as a slave.


643
0:37:49,767 --> 0:37:52,937
But how did the flood come into it?


644
0:37:52,937 --> 0:37:54,238
The most likely answer


645
0:37:54,238 --> 0:37:55,539
is that Noah was caught out


646
0:37:55,539 --> 0:38:0,344
by a freak combination
of natural events.


647
0:38:0,344 --> 0:38:2,513
Parts of the Euphrates
were only navigable


648
0:38:2,513 --> 0:38:5,116
when river levels
were at their peak.


649
0:38:5,116 --> 0:38:6,45
That meant Noah would have


650
0:38:6,45 --> 0:38:9,253
had to time his departure carefully.


651
0:38:9,253 --> 0:38:35,146
That meant waiting
for the melt waters.


652
0:38:35,146 --> 0:38:37,181
Melting snow
from the Armenian mountains


653
0:38:37,181 --> 0:38:40,418
increased the flow
of the Euphrates in July.


654
0:38:40,418 --> 0:38:42,32
Records indicate that only then


655
0:38:42,32 --> 0:38:50,461
were the river channels
deep enough for large vessels.


656
0:38:50,461 --> 0:38:54,365
But there was a risk.


657
0:38:54,365 --> 0:38:56,701
If Shuruppak was hit
by a freak storm


658
0:38:56,701 --> 0:38:58,269
just at the moment that river levels


659
0:38:58,269 --> 0:38:59,57
were at their highest,


660
0:38:59,57 --> 0:39:1,539
then the peaceful waters
of the Euphrates


661
0:39:1,539 --> 0:39:5,676
could turn into a raging flood.


662
0:39:5,676 --> 0:39:6,944
But the average rainfall


663
0:39:6,944 --> 0:39:11,48
in dry years in July was zero.


664
0:39:11,48 --> 0:39:13,17
The odds
on a catastrophic river flood


665
0:39:13,17 --> 0:39:15,319
in Mesopotamia
would have been remote


666
0:39:15,319 --> 0:39:19,824
about one in every 1000 years.


667
0:39:19,824 --> 0:39:21,659
So if it happened


668
0:39:21,659 --> 0:39:29,967
it should have been worth
writing about


669
0:39:29,967 --> 0:39:32,737
The Babylonian tablets say that
on the day of the flood,


670
0:39:32,737 --> 0:39:33,971
Noah and his family


671
0:39:33,971 --> 0:39:37,708
were having a banquet on the barge.


672
0:39:37,708 --> 0:39:38,909
Then the weather suddenly


673
0:39:38,909 --> 0:39:41,245
began to change for the worse -


674
0:39:41,245 --> 0:39:42,98
a freak storm was beginning


675
0:39:42,98 --> 0:39:49,353
and a catastrophic flood
was on its way.


676
0:39:49,353 --> 0:40:9,407
A storm that would threaten
Noah's very survival.


677
0:40:9,407 --> 0:40:11,308
If a flash flood was big enough


678
0:40:11,308 --> 0:40:13,77
to sweep away Noah's ark


679
0:40:13,77 --> 0:40:14,578
and put his life in danger


680
0:40:14,578 --> 0:40:17,982
it would have began
with rainfall of tropical intensity


681
0:40:17,982 --> 0:40:22,219
in the mountains
where the rivers rise.


682
0:40:22,219 --> 0:40:24,789
Mesopotamia isn't in the tropics,


683
0:40:24,789 --> 0:40:26,424
but there's evidence that hurricanes


684
0:40:26,424 --> 0:40:33,697
and tropical storms
could get that far.


685
0:40:33,697 --> 0:40:35,266
Some 6000 years ago


686
0:40:35,266 --> 0:40:37,101
it was much warmer and wetter


687
0:40:37,101 --> 0:40:39,36
and it would be
no surprise whatsoever


688
0:40:39,36 --> 0:40:42,473
to get a tropical storm.


689
0:40:42,473 --> 0:40:46,677
we could have had ten times
the rainfall Some


690
0:40:46,677 --> 0:40:50,114
of these metereological events
are absolutely catastrophic,


691
0:40:50,114 --> 0:40:51,816
and these are the sort of events


692
0:40:51,816 --> 0:40:53,15
that we record in history -


693
0:40:53,15 --> 0:41:0,357
we don't record the normal
day to day humdrum


694
0:41:0,357 --> 0:41:1,792
If a freak storm


695
0:41:1,792 --> 0:41:4,929
coincided with the seasonal
snow melt,


696
0:41:4,929 --> 0:41:7,431
then the Euphrates could easily


697
0:41:7,431 --> 0:41:35,92
have flooded
the Mesopotamian plain.


698
0:41:35,92 --> 0:41:36,994
The Bible says the storm lasted


699
0:41:36,994 --> 0:41:39,463
for an incredible 40 days.


700
0:41:39,463 --> 0:41:44,368
The Babylonian tablets say
it was 7.


701
0:41:44,368 --> 0:41:46,103
But even a single day


702
0:41:46,103 --> 0:41:54,812
would have been terrible,
life threatening.


703
0:41:54,812 --> 0:41:57,848
With much of his cargo
left behind or swept away,


704
0:41:57,848 --> 0:41:59,149
Noah's barge would have been


705
0:41:59,149 --> 0:42:40,157
at the mercy of
the raging Euphrates.


706
0:42:40,157 --> 0:42:42,927
The following day
say the Babylonian tablets,


707
0:42:42,927 --> 0:42:46,597
Noah and his family
couldn't see land.


708
0:42:46,597 --> 0:42:53,237
The flood extended for miles.


709
0:42:53,237 --> 0:42:55,606
After the storm,
Noah and his family


710
0:42:55,606 --> 0:42:57,908
must have longed
for the waters to subside,


711
0:42:57,908 --> 0:43:2,79
and ground them on the banks
of the Euphrates.


712
0:43:2,79 --> 0:43:9,86
In fact, their problems
had only just begun.


713
0:43:9,86 --> 0:43:11,55
All versions of the story agree


714
0:43:11,55 --> 0:43:14,625
that they couldn't see land
for at least seven days.


715
0:43:14,625 --> 0:43:16,527
The Bible concludes
that Noah's flood


716
0:43:16,527 --> 0:43:19,597
covered the whole world.


717
0:43:19,597 --> 0:43:25,135
But there is
in fact another explanation.


718
0:43:25,135 --> 0:43:26,67
Noah's family would have believed


719
0:43:26,67 --> 0:43:29,273
that they were drifting
on the flooded Euphrates.


720
0:43:29,273 --> 0:43:30,608
They would have been relieved


721
0:43:30,608 --> 0:43:32,81
that at the very least
the river water meant


722
0:43:32,81 --> 0:43:38,916
they wouldn't die of thirst.


723
0:43:38,916 --> 0:43:41,552
But the Babylonian versions suggest


724
0:43:41,552 --> 0:43:54,98
that the water was salty.


725
0:43:54,98 --> 0:43:56,6
Noah's ark, was no longer drifting


726
0:43:56,6 --> 0:44:1,5
on the flooded Euphrates


727
0:44:1,5 --> 0:44:3,44
If you plot Noah's course
from Shuruppak -


728
0:44:3,44 --> 0:44:5,175
now in the flooded plain -


729
0:44:5,175 --> 0:44:7,11
the currents
would have swept his barge


730
0:44:7,11 --> 0:44:11,715
downstream into the Persian Gulf!


731
0:44:11,715 --> 0:44:14,51
This tallies
with the epic of Gilgamesh


732
0:44:14,51 --> 0:44:23,27
which says that
the he ''looked upon the sea''.


733
0:44:23,27 --> 0:44:25,462
There's no telling how long
Noah and his family


734
0:44:25,462 --> 0:44:28,198
would have stayed marooned
in the Persian Gulf.


735
0:44:28,198 --> 0:44:31,101
The Bible records more than a year,


736
0:44:31,101 --> 0:44:37,41
the Babylonian tablets suggest
just a week.


737
0:44:37,41 --> 0:44:39,243
Either way - Noah and his family


738
0:44:39,243 --> 0:44:42,413
had a big problem: salty water.


739
0:44:42,413 --> 0:44:46,784
What would they drink?


740
0:44:46,784 --> 0:44:49,19
Without freshwater
from rain or river,


741
0:44:49,19 --> 0:44:51,555
their only alternative
would have been the beer


742
0:44:51,555 --> 0:44:54,825
they were carrying
for their traders.


743
0:44:54,825 --> 0:44:57,428
Beer is actually a good alternative.


744
0:44:57,428 --> 0:45:0,23
And we know we had it three
and half thousand years ago.


745
0:45:0,23 --> 0:45:4,301
They were brewing beer,


746
0:45:4,301 --> 0:45:6,136
it's full of nutrients,


747
0:45:6,136 --> 0:45:8,439
most important it's sterile


748
0:45:8,439 --> 0:45:10,641
and wouldn't suffer
from contamination


749
0:45:10,641 --> 0:45:24,354
like water might.


750
0:45:24,354 --> 0:45:26,59
One of the hallmarks
of the Noah story


751
0:45:26,59 --> 0:45:28,292
is that the Ark
is said to have landed


752
0:45:28,292 --> 0:45:32,763
in the mountains of Ararat.


753
0:45:32,763 --> 0:45:34,665
But if there was no global flood


754
0:45:34,665 --> 0:45:35,866
then it's far more likely


755
0:45:35,866 --> 0:45:41,238
that it landed
somewhere else altogether.


756
0:45:41,238 --> 0:45:42,473
The mountains of Ararat


757
0:45:42,473 --> 0:45:45,142
lie to the north of Shuruppak.


758
0:45:45,142 --> 0:45:46,61
Swept downriver,


759
0:45:46,61 --> 0:45:49,179
the barge would have grounded
500 miles away


760
0:45:49,179 --> 0:45:51,949
on the shores of the Persian Gulf.


761
0:45:51,949 --> 0:45:53,684
In the Bible once the ark


762
0:45:53,684 --> 0:45:56,92
has grounded the story
is almost over.


763
0:45:56,92 --> 0:45:58,455
But the Babylonian tablets


764
0:45:58,455 --> 0:46:6,33
hint that Noah's adventure
was far from over


765
0:46:6,33 --> 0:46:8,766
There are several
puzzling references -


766
0:46:8,766 --> 0:46:11,969
one talks of 'the overthrowing
of his kingship',


767
0:46:11,969 --> 0:46:20,377
another says the flood hero
was 'expelled'.


768
0:46:20,377 --> 0:46:22,279
All of these references
clearly suggest


769
0:46:22,279 --> 0:46:23,58
that for some reason,


770
0:46:23,58 --> 0:46:25,983
Noah couldn't return to Shuruppak -


771
0:46:25,983 --> 0:46:27,918
that even when the flood was over,


772
0:46:27,918 --> 0:46:32,22
he was still in mortal danger


773
0:46:32,22 --> 0:46:34,158
The most likely explanation


774
0:46:34,158 --> 0:46:36,26
is that many of Noah's creditors


775
0:46:36,26 --> 0:46:37,795
had survived the deluge,


776
0:46:37,795 --> 0:46:39,53
had tracked him down


777
0:46:39,53 --> 0:46:44,101
and were now demanding
their money back.


778
0:46:44,101 --> 0:46:45,636
Under Sumerian law


779
0:46:45,636 --> 0:46:47,938
Noah could be forced into slavery


780
0:46:47,938 --> 0:46:50,674
to repay his debts.


781
0:46:50,674 --> 0:46:58,448
He would have had to flee
the country to avoid prosecution.


782
0:46:58,448 --> 0:47:0,83
Precisely where the fugitive


783
0:47:0,83 --> 0:47:2,653
Noah went is something
of a mystery.


784
0:47:2,653 --> 0:47:4,221
One of the Babylonian tablets says


785
0:47:4,221 --> 0:47:10,27
that Noah went to live
in a land called Dilmun.


786
0:47:10,27 --> 0:47:11,795
Now that's the Sumerian name


787
0:47:11,795 --> 0:47:14,965
for the modern island of Bahrain.


788
0:47:14,965 --> 0:47:23,674
Maybe this is where he came to rest.


789
0:47:23,674 --> 0:47:27,1
That is where,
after the flood was over,


790
0:47:27,1 --> 0:47:30,414
the Babylonian Noah
was settled by the gods.


791
0:47:30,414 --> 0:47:33,5
Apparently it was a pleasant
place to be


792
0:47:33,5 --> 0:47:35,552
where he could exist
without much work


793
0:47:35,552 --> 0:47:39,957
and pass the time away
as he pleased.


794
0:47:39,957 --> 0:47:42,526
If he did end up in Dilmun,


795
0:47:42,526 --> 0:47:44,561
then the modern island of Bahrain


796
0:47:44,561 --> 0:47:52,736
may have a remarkable secret.


797
0:47:52,736 --> 0:47:54,204
Its landscape is dotted


798
0:47:54,204 --> 0:47:57,74
with hundreds of thousands
of burial mounds.


799
0:47:57,74 --> 0:47:58,909
And only a handful of these tombs


800
0:47:58,909 --> 0:48:1,11
have been excavated.


801
0:48:1,11 --> 0:48:4,948
But many date back
to Sumerian times.


802
0:48:4,948 --> 0:48:7,251
They are the sort of place
a great king


803
0:48:7,251 --> 0:48:15,359
would be laid to rest in.


804
0:48:15,359 --> 0:48:17,527
In time the memory of a king


805
0:48:17,527 --> 0:48:19,129
who survived a flood


806
0:48:19,129 --> 0:48:23,33
could have been turned
into a great Sumerian legend.


807
0:48:23,33 --> 0:48:24,234
It would have been embellished


808
0:48:24,234 --> 0:48:32,576
with miraculous
and mythological elements.


809
0:48:32,576 --> 0:48:35,212
Eventually it would have been
written down,


810
0:48:35,212 --> 0:48:38,882
copied and recopied
by generations of scribes,


811
0:48:38,882 --> 0:48:47,824
giving rise to new versions.


812
0:48:47,824 --> 0:48:49,626
Two thousand years later,


813
0:48:49,626 --> 0:48:51,28
one of those versions,


814
0:48:51,28 --> 0:48:53,23
languishing in a library in Babylon


815
0:48:53,23 --> 0:48:54,698
could also have come
to the attention


816
0:48:54,698 --> 0:48:58,635
of the Jewish priests
who wrote the Bible.


817
0:48:58,635 --> 0:49:0,47
When they first read the story,


818
0:49:0,47 --> 0:49:5,475
how could they fail to recognise
the lessons it offers.


819
0:49:5,475 --> 0:49:9,846
If humankind falls
short of God's laws


820
0:49:9,846 --> 0:49:13,684
there's a dreadful price to pay.


821
0:49:13,684 --> 0:49:15,619
Behind that moral message


822
0:49:15,619 --> 0:49:19,923
lies one of
the world's great stories.


823
0:49:19,923 --> 0:49:21,925
And behind that story


824
0:49:21,925 --> 0:49:25,295
we can just glimpse a real man,


825
0:49:25,295 --> 0:51:25,295
a real boat, and a real adventure.
