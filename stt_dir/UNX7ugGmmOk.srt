0:0:42,86 --> 0:0:47,37
remember the time agee and propriety of
involved in on when the president had to


8
0:0:47,37 --> 0:0:53,59
sleep on the poor analysis definate king
wherein everyone the next morning


9
0:0:53,59 --> 0:0:56,999
dreamt that exactly how you look reveals
a mac when you can find it to the park


10
0:0:56,999 --> 0:1:1,309
bench overthink with all of the thread
there covering of imperial oil instead


11
0:1:1,309 --> 0:1:4,65
of giving at the questioning protection
of the loop


12
0:1:4,65 --> 0:1:8,73
you expect your car to give you money
about one of the park service will


13
0:1:8,73 --> 0:1:10,67
rather well treated according


14
0:1:10,67 --> 0:1:14,82
given like prolonging companies of
operation by taking it stop of life to


15
0:1:14,82 --> 0:1:15,98
remove


16
0:1:15,98 --> 0:1:20,3
the enduring motor oil that really
protect every bible moving part with


17
0:1:20,3 --> 0:1:22,61
saturn's moon covering mood


18
0:1:22,61 --> 0:1:28,9
guests and at the same time so strong
impenetrable apa devastating enterprise


19
0:1:28,9 --> 0:1:32,21
bead in hot weather can not leave your
motor to get in their dirty work


20
0:1:32,21 --> 0:1:35,59
so when you get real brenda cracked the
governing the powers more police caught


21
0:1:35,59 --> 0:1:39,29
fire engines and it is another emergency
equipment for every this hole than any


22
0:1:39,29 --> 0:1:40,61
other brand


23
0:1:40,61 --> 0:1:53,14
get three lou the finest mobil oil
golden west


24
0:1:53,14 --> 0:1:56,33
the story really here tonight was taken
in the main from facts on file in the


25
0:1:56,33 --> 0:1:57,719
los angeles police department


26
0:1:57,719 --> 0:2:2,25
we have air force chief of police being
debated to preface our program he paid


27
0:2:2,25 --> 0:2:4,5
good evening ladies and gentlemen


28
0:2:4,5 --> 0:2:8,9
sometimes the most dramatic work on the
part of the peace officer


29
0:2:8,9 --> 0:2:11,299
goes unnoticed by the rank and file of
the city's people


30
0:2:11,299 --> 0:2:15,559
simply because network has not been
blaze moon headlines


31
0:2:15,559 --> 0:2:18,299
sometimes an important case is broken


32
0:2:18,299 --> 0:2:20,709
but the story behind it never breaks


33
0:2:20,709 --> 0:2:24,189
for the average peace officer does not
want publicity


34
0:2:24,189 --> 0:2:25,759
he does not needed


35
0:2:25,759 --> 0:2:27,94
he does his duty as he sees it


36
0:2:27,94 --> 0:2:30,479
and does not look for praise


37
0:2:30,479 --> 0:2:35,599
the vast majority of criminal cases were
investigated and cold without them there


38
0:2:35,599 --> 0:2:37,809
such as our story tonight


39
0:2:37,809 --> 0:2:40,3
because person still living might be
heard


40
0:2:40,3 --> 0:2:43,689
by the broadcasters certain facts
surrounding our story


41
0:2:43,689 --> 0:2:47,849
we have purposely change both local and
personnel


42
0:2:47,849 --> 0:2:51,749
it is our desire to present our problems
without harm to anyone


43
0:2:51,749 --> 0:2:53,659
but to bring out most certainly


44
0:2:53,659 --> 0:2:57,199
but crime of any sort is an unprofitable
enterprise


45
0:2:57,199 --> 0:3:6,599
actual reserve additional facts or the
end of the problem


46
0:3:6,599 --> 0:3:9,869
interfaces home in one of the land of
the most expensive resident of this


47
0:3:9,869 --> 0:3:13,779
bindle father and his son engage in
heated argument


48
0:3:13,779 --> 0:3:17,849
well i cannot tell plane but mighty like
a they sang and matt


49
0:3:17,849 --> 0:3:19,9
thinking it is standing there shouting


50
0:3:19,9 --> 0:3:21,58
and that isn't going to get your
anywhere


51
0:3:21,58 --> 0:3:25,63
and thinking i thought then doing day
and night thinking think if that


52
0:3:25,63 --> 0:3:29,9
medication wouldn't be talking like an
idiot i might need it because the whole


53
0:3:29,9 --> 0:3:30,169
animal out


54
0:3:30,169 --> 0:3:31,36
you did a thing thing


55
0:3:31,36 --> 0:3:33,319
the left at the opposition and
resentment


56
0:3:33,319 --> 0:3:35,819
he went right ahead married mother in
spite of every time


57
0:3:35,819 --> 0:3:39,789
not offering any opposition i'm not
holding any resentment you can marry


58
0:3:39,789 --> 0:3:44,189
anyone you peace and good luck to you
about not now paddle wheels the op that


59
0:3:44,189 --> 0:3:47,339
i said i'll pay you when you refuse to
give me a logical reason we won't go


60
0:3:47,339 --> 0:3:48,699
into that again


61
0:3:48,699 --> 0:3:52,189
my reason for that many of them a is
sufficiently logic and a satisfying the


62
0:3:52,189 --> 0:3:54,179
even that's a big help business


63
0:3:54,179 --> 0:3:57,379
how relevant the marion on tell you have
a logical reason why we shouldn't get


64
0:3:57,379 --> 0:3:58,13
married


65
0:3:58,13 --> 0:4:1,73
she'll probably appreciate that showed
up with have great respect for the you


66
0:4:1,73 --> 0:4:4,509
care about bob dole out somewhere and
cool off


67
0:4:4,509 --> 0:4:7,609
and come back and talk to me like a
sensible person it's my turn to stand on


68
0:4:7,609 --> 0:4:8,759
my own p


69
0:4:8,759 --> 0:4:11,89
i can see where it's going to be
necessary for me to take whatever action


70
0:4:11,89 --> 0:4:14,689
i think that rebuttable what do you mean
they'll find out


71
0:4:14,689 --> 0:4:16,65
and only a money order you any good


72
0:4:16,65 --> 0:4:20,709
i'm going to get what i want in this
case understand that no matter how i get


73
0:4:20,709 --> 0:4:35,249

74
0:4:35,249 --> 0:4:36,56

76
0:4:40,61 --> 0:4:41,65
of


77
0:4:41,65 --> 0:4:43,669

for him to him on the morning to cover


82
0:4:54,909 --> 0:4:57,49
and you dig up two hundred thousand over
the weekend


83
0:4:57,49 --> 0:4:59,65
chant


84
0:4:59,65 --> 0:5:1,65

0:9:24,75 --> 0:9:26,769
accordion with water hain


183
0:9:26,769 --> 0:9:28,78
and public admit that

0:9:30,17 --> 0:9:34,41
colored optimistic but i'll get a lot of
myself number one the water curled


186
0:9:34,41 --> 0:9:37,88
from under water


187
0:9:37,88 --> 0:9:43,85
and uh...


188
0:9:43,85 --> 0:9:47,64
further investigation shows qwestoffice
dot was due to cyanide poisoning but how


189
0:9:47,64 --> 0:9:51,1
would that have gone with the minister
of my home was still a mystery


190
0:9:51,1 --> 0:9:55,51
open water the homeless on the table
sign the consent of ryan to investigate


191
0:9:55,51 --> 0:9:58,0
something wrong in this whiskey the
sandy


192
0:9:58,0 --> 0:10:1,7
something we will look kinda about that
when i'm in the end of one of my dreams


193
0:10:1,7 --> 0:10:4,77
i noticed that the papers this morning
for michael new or heart failure dead


194
0:10:4,77 --> 0:10:8,19
that's fine long as they felt that way
we'll have time to work


195
0:10:8,19 --> 0:10:10,94
it's when they start yelling murder
without anything to go on that i get


196
0:10:10,94 --> 0:10:14,5
worried when i still can't see how men
can die from cyanide poisoning and was


197
0:10:14,5 --> 0:10:19,2
he dubbed himself or somebody gave it to
him yeah that's on this for grogram but


198
0:10:19,2 --> 0:10:23,17
obviously needed big according to the
stories we've gotten so far the reform


199
0:10:23,17 --> 0:10:24,13
in in that room


200
0:10:24,13 --> 0:10:26,7
none of the mcveigh touching anything


201
0:10:26,7 --> 0:10:28,1
none of them so anything you cannot go


202
0:10:28,1 --> 0:10:30,49

1073
1:0:35,439 --> 1:0:37,959
the story really here tonight has been
taken from the file of the los angeles


1074
1:0:37,959 --> 1:0:39,569
police department


1075
1:0:39,569 --> 1:0:45,169
we have therefore us chief of police
gameday davis to open our program


1076
1:0:45,169 --> 1:0:49,179
all the people who come to hollywood
break into the movie is wouldn't

there'd be a lot more happen is all
around


1078
1:0:52,569 --> 1:0:56,879
it has always been a mystery to me how
anyone in his right mind


1079
1:0:56,879 --> 1:1:1,289
will allow himself to be sold so
completely by spurious producer


1080
1:1:1,289 --> 1:1:3,619
that he will fight with his hard-earned
money


1081
1:1:3,619 --> 1:1:4,67

1082
1:1:4,67 --> 1:1:7,989
that he will someday be a big shot in
the movies


1083
1:1:7,989 --> 1:1:12,119
one of the most constantly recurring
problems the police have to deal with


1084
1:1:12,119 --> 1:1:14,729
is that of some unsuspecting person


1085
1:1:14,729 --> 1:1:20,109
letting his life savings there were some
unscrupulous let's move down from over


1086
1:1:20,109 --> 1:1:23,279
the case we're about to hear is one and
point


1087
1:1:23,279 --> 1:1:26,609
even though the criminal in this case
was caught and punished


1088
1:1:26,609 --> 1:1:29,589
the fact remains that a lot of people
would have been better off


1089
1:1:29,589 --> 1:1:31,979
if they had stayed away from hollywood


1090
1:1:31,979 --> 1:1:34,89

he might do to my husband


1314
1:12:52,2 --> 1:12:54,35
