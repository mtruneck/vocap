1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,17



2
0:0:10,17 --> 0:0:13,79
RB UMALI: Josh's personality
back then, you could tell he


3
0:0:13,79 --> 0:0:14,98
came from a tough background.


4
0:0:14,98 --> 0:0:18,73
He had a lot of tough family
issues that he dealt with.


5
0:0:18,73 --> 0:0:21,52
And he had a funny way of just
telling stories about


6
0:0:21,52 --> 0:0:22,83
his past and stuff.


7
0:0:22,83 --> 0:0:24,8
And I didn't know whether
to believe him or not.


8
0:0:24,8 --> 0:0:27,22
JOSH KALLIS: When I went to
live back with my dad in


9
0:0:27,22 --> 0:0:30,6
Dallas, we didn't get
along at all.


10
0:0:30,6 --> 0:0:32,59
I was doing my thing in the city
of Dallas, hanging out


11
0:0:32,59 --> 0:0:35,9
with these dudes who were
not necessarily


12
0:0:35,9 --> 0:0:38,65
gangsters, but kind of.


13
0:0:38,65 --> 0:0:39,89
But they were skaters.


14
0:0:39,89 --> 0:0:42,28
And I fell right
into that mix.


15
0:0:42,28 --> 0:0:46,59
Around that time, I got locked
up in this mental institution


16
0:0:46,59 --> 0:0:49,55
for six or seven months.


17
0:0:49,55 --> 0:0:51,6
I got caught stealing.


18
0:0:51,6 --> 0:0:54,54
And they took me to
jail for stealing.


19
0:0:54,54 --> 0:0:56,77
And I was in there
for two days.


20
0:0:56,77 --> 0:1:1,7
And this bounty hunter
dude in a full suit--


21
0:1:1,7 --> 0:1:3,11
he was almost albino--


22
0:1:3,11 --> 0:1:4,59
took me out of the jail.


23
0:1:4,59 --> 0:1:7,42
He pulls out a 9 millimeter
and he says, hey, state of


24
0:1:7,42 --> 0:1:9,4
Texas says I can do anything
in my power to


25
0:1:9,4 --> 0:1:10,22
keep you from running.


26
0:1:10,22 --> 0:1:11,9
So don't run.


27
0:1:11,9 --> 0:1:12,63
It's like, all right.


28
0:1:12,63 --> 0:1:15,54
So on the way down there he had
me filling out all these


29
0:1:15,54 --> 0:1:19,47
crazy psych forms, like, do you
study license plates, and


30
0:1:19,47 --> 0:1:21,27
just crazy questions.


31
0:1:21,27 --> 0:1:24,4
So I got put in this institution
where there was


32
0:1:24,4 --> 0:1:27,32
all these murderers who
got out on whatever.


33
0:1:27,32 --> 0:1:29,5
They were like fucked
up in the brain.


34
0:1:29,5 --> 0:1:31,48
So instead of going to prison,
they went here.


35
0:1:31,48 --> 0:1:36,16
No shoestrings, no belts, big
magnet locks on the doors.


36
0:1:36,16 --> 0:1:38,34
They take my blood every
couple days.


37
0:1:38,34 --> 0:1:40,25
And I would go in to these
counseling sessions and they'd


38
0:1:40,25 --> 0:1:42,2
be like, so what are
you doing here?


39
0:1:42,2 --> 0:1:43,87
Johnny, Timmy, they all
killed somebody.


40
0:1:43,87 --> 0:1:45,4
He raped four girls.


41
0:1:45,4 --> 0:1:45,86
Blah, blah, blah.


42
0:1:45,86 --> 0:1:48,74
And they'd come to me and I'd be
like, I don't fucking know.


43
0:1:48,74 --> 0:1:51,6
You guys are all
fucking psycho.


44
0:1:51,6 --> 0:1:53,8
One day I ran out
of toilet paper.


45
0:1:53,8 --> 0:1:55,37
And you walk up to the lady.


46
0:1:55,37 --> 0:1:57,23
She had to go back
into the closet.


47
0:1:57,23 --> 0:1:59,6
So when she went back into the
closet, her little desk phone,


48
0:1:59,6 --> 0:2:2,68
I picked it up, hit nine,
and dialed my mom.


49
0:2:2,68 --> 0:2:5,44
My mom answered screaming
at me.


50
0:2:5,44 --> 0:2:7,45
I told her I was in Salt Lake
City at some place.


51
0:2:7,45 --> 0:2:10,699
And I ended up waking
up in a closet.


52
0:2:10,699 --> 0:2:13,47
They hit me from behind
with some drugs.


53
0:2:13,47 --> 0:2:15,77
So whatever.


54
0:2:15,77 --> 0:2:16,58
You move forward.


55
0:2:16,58 --> 0:2:20,45
And bounty hunter came, scooped
me up, says, all


56
0:2:20,45 --> 0:2:22,1
right, you're on a plane
back to Dallas.


57
0:2:22,1 --> 0:2:25,84
And he says that what it
was was my dad did it.


58
0:2:25,84 --> 0:2:29,18
He thought I was this
fucked up kid.


59
0:2:29,18 --> 0:2:30,68
And he hired this
dude to get me.


60
0:2:30,68 --> 0:2:33,12
And then his insurance
company paid for it.


61
0:2:33,12 --> 0:2:36,45
And shit, I'd've been
in there six years.


62
0:2:36,45 --> 0:2:38,58
But I got out in six months.


63
0:2:38,58 --> 0:2:41,27
And when I got out, the H Street
thing just wasn't even


64
0:2:41,27 --> 0:2:42,5
an option for me.


65
0:2:42,5 --> 0:2:45,61
The girl I would call to get the
boxes and all that stuff,


66
0:2:45,61 --> 0:2:50,3
when I called her she was like,
yeah, Tony said no.


67
0:2:50,3 --> 0:2:51,8
Josh is out.


68
0:2:51,8 --> 0:2:54,57
So skating was almost
done for me.


69
0:2:54,57 --> 0:2:56,55
I didn't give a shit, dude.


70
0:2:56,55 --> 0:2:57,75
I didn't have a board.


71
0:2:57,75 --> 0:2:58,91
I didn't have none of that.


72
0:2:58,91 --> 0:3:0,65
And I didn't care.


73
0:3:0,65 --> 0:3:2,4
I got back with my homies.


74
0:3:2,4 --> 0:3:4,506
I told my dad, fuck him,
like, fuck you, I


75
0:3:4,506 --> 0:3:5,24
know the whole story.


76
0:3:5,24 --> 0:3:8,37
I don't want to have nothing
to do with you anymore.


77
0:3:8,37 --> 0:3:9,47
And I went to Dallas.


78
0:3:9,47 --> 0:3:10,67
And I just hung out
with my friends.


79
0:3:10,67 --> 0:3:15,86
And we lived in North
Dallas, just hood.


80
0:3:15,86 --> 0:3:19,52
I mean, it was cockroaches
and gangsters.


81
0:3:19,52 --> 0:3:20,31
It was crazy.


82
0:3:20,31 --> 0:3:23,46
And it wasn't until I heard
these rumors that Jamie Thomas


83
0:3:23,46 --> 0:3:26,24
was coming in to Dallas--


84
0:3:26,24 --> 0:3:30,27
shit, I hadn't even skated
in six or seven months.


85
0:3:30,27 --> 0:3:32,93
JAMIE THOMAS: I was traveling
across the United States with


86
0:3:32,93 --> 0:3:33,71
some buddies.


87
0:3:33,71 --> 0:3:35,32
And at that time I rode
for Invisible.


88
0:3:35,32 --> 0:3:39,42
And we went through Dallas,
Texas, and I don't know how I


89
0:3:39,42 --> 0:3:40,24
even linked up with him.


90
0:3:40,24 --> 0:3:42,99
But I think I heard he
lived in Dallas.


91
0:3:42,99 --> 0:3:45,46
JOSH KALLIS: Jamie was like,
you got a board?


92
0:3:45,46 --> 0:3:46,42
I said, nah.


93
0:3:46,42 --> 0:3:46,96
And he hooked me up.


94
0:3:46,96 --> 0:3:50,45
He gave me an Invisible board
and took me to the skate shop


95
0:3:50,45 --> 0:3:51,23
and got some trucks.


96
0:3:51,23 --> 0:3:52,48
And I got a set up.


97
0:3:52,48 --> 0:3:58,37



98
0:3:58,37 --> 0:3:59,49
JAMIE THOMAS: We went
skating that day,


99
0:3:59,49 --> 0:4:0,6
and it was just like--


100
0:4:0,6 --> 0:4:5,47
I was filming him, and he was
just seriously so good.


101
0:4:5,47 --> 0:4:7,7
At that time it was obvious
he was way better


102
0:4:7,7 --> 0:4:8,7
than a lot of people.


103
0:4:8,7 --> 0:4:9,96
And he was definitely
good enough to be


104
0:4:9,96 --> 0:4:11,71
sponsored by whoever.


105
0:4:11,71 --> 0:4:15,78
But he was just hanging out with
these gang banger dudes


106
0:4:15,78 --> 0:4:18,725
in Dallas, super thug dudes
that-- they were super cool


107
0:4:18,725 --> 0:4:21,25
and stuff, but it was just
a whole other life.


108
0:4:21,25 --> 0:4:22,46
There was nothing
about skating.


109
0:4:22,46 --> 0:4:25,5
Even though all the dudes in his
clique used to skate and


110
0:4:25,5 --> 0:4:30,6
were skaters, they were more
about being thug hustlers than


111
0:4:30,6 --> 0:4:31,31
they were skaters.


112
0:4:31,31 --> 0:4:34,96



113
0:4:34,96 --> 0:4:36,91
It was obvious that he didn't
have a real stable


114
0:4:36,91 --> 0:4:38,88
situation going on.


115
0:4:38,88 --> 0:4:41,22
I think he was living with his
dad at the time, but I don't


116
0:4:41,22 --> 0:4:42,31
even know if he was staying
with his dad.


117
0:4:42,31 --> 0:4:49,71
He was probably maybe
just 18 then.


118
0:4:49,71 --> 0:4:50,65
It was insane.


119
0:4:50,65 --> 0:4:52,535
Right then I was like, wow, this
is one of the best kids


120
0:4:52,535 --> 0:4:53,67
I've ever seen skate.


121
0:4:53,67 --> 0:4:55,78
He's so good.


122
0:4:55,78 --> 0:5:1,77
JOSH KALLIS: All I know is we
skated that weekend, and I


123
0:5:1,77 --> 0:5:6,24
filmed, I don't know, like two
minutes of probably the best


124
0:5:6,24 --> 0:5:9,23
skateboarding I've ever done
in my life to this day.


125
0:5:9,23 --> 0:5:17,87



126
0:5:17,87 --> 0:5:20,11
JAMIE THOMAS: I remember he
filmed a line that was like a


127
0:5:20,11 --> 0:5:20,563
minute long.


128
0:5:20,563 --> 0:5:22,48
It was the most flat ground
tricks I'd ever seen anybody


129
0:5:22,48 --> 0:5:23,35
do in a row before.


130
0:5:23,35 --> 0:5:24,6
And he did them all in a line.


131
0:5:24,6 --> 0:5:27,37



132
0:5:27,37 --> 0:5:30,1
At that point I was just
like, hey, man.


133
0:5:30,1 --> 0:5:32,18
I wasn't running Invisible or
nothing, but I was just like,


134
0:5:32,18 --> 0:5:34,116
hey, if you want to ride for
this company, I'm sure I can


135
0:5:34,116 --> 0:5:36,87
figure out a way to
make it happen.


136
0:5:36,87 --> 0:5:38,66
He probably didn't even know in
his mind if he was going to


137
0:5:38,66 --> 0:5:40,32
continue skating or
not after I left.


138
0:5:40,32 --> 0:5:42,98



139
0:5:42,98 --> 0:5:45,4
But if he got free stuff showing
up in the mail, he was


140
0:5:45,4 --> 0:5:47,16
either going to be able to skate
it, sell it, whatever.


141
0:5:47,16 --> 0:5:48,72
It was going to be something.


142
0:5:48,72 --> 0:5:51,87
So I left, got home, and then
lined up a package and started


143
0:5:51,87 --> 0:5:53,57
sending him stuff.


144
0:5:53,57 --> 0:5:55,22
JOSH KALLIS: Jamie called
me up, and he--


145
0:5:55,22 --> 0:5:57,26
oh yeah, I forgot
about this part.


146
0:5:57,26 --> 0:5:59,7
This was my very first tour.


147
0:5:59,7 --> 0:5:59,42
He called me up.


148
0:5:59,42 --> 0:6:1,6
He said, hey, man, we're doing
an Invisible tour.


149
0:6:1,6 --> 0:6:6,362
Why don't you jump in the van?


150
0:6:6,362 --> 0:6:8,0
So OK.


151
0:6:8,0 --> 0:6:9,87
So I on the van, but
Jamie wasn't there.


152
0:6:9,87 --> 0:6:13,84
Jamie had quit Invisible just
as I was going on this


153
0:6:13,84 --> 0:6:14,88
Invisible tour.


154
0:6:14,88 --> 0:6:16,42
So I went on the tour anyway.


155
0:6:16,42 --> 0:6:17,64
JAMIE THOMAS: He went on the
tour with those dudes, and


156
0:6:17,64 --> 0:6:19,56
they just went trucking
across the US.


157
0:6:19,56 --> 0:6:22,95
And then basically I called him
when I got on Toy Machine.


158
0:6:22,95 --> 0:6:24,14
He was back in Dallas.


159
0:6:24,14 --> 0:6:26,59
Basically Ed was like, hey
man, you down to help me


160
0:6:26,59 --> 0:6:27,27
rebuild the team?


161
0:6:27,27 --> 0:6:27,97
And I was like, sure.


162
0:6:27,97 --> 0:6:29,39
You got any guys you want?


163
0:6:29,39 --> 0:6:32,4
And he was like,
no, not really.


164
0:6:32,4 --> 0:6:35,31
But if you want to figure
something out or get some guys


165
0:6:35,31 --> 0:6:36,23
on the team, I'd be psyched.


166
0:6:36,23 --> 0:6:37,86
So I started with Kallis.


167
0:6:37,86 --> 0:6:39,11
Basically he was one
of the dudes.


168
0:6:39,11 --> 0:6:42,81



169
0:6:42,81 --> 0:6:46,21
JOSH KALLIS: I went back to
doing my Dallas hood shit,


170
0:6:46,21 --> 0:6:47,3
skating a little bit.


171
0:6:47,3 --> 0:6:49,51
A couple months later he
got a hold of me, and


172
0:6:49,51 --> 0:6:51,69
he's like, hey man.


173
0:6:51,69 --> 0:6:56,72
Dudes are really fucking
hyped on your footage.


174
0:6:56,72 --> 0:6:58,96
I don't know where he put it,
but he was like, dude, if you


175
0:6:58,96 --> 0:7:2,43
can get out here, I'll let
you live at my house.


176
0:7:2,43 --> 0:7:4,51
You just have to get out here.


177
0:7:4,51 --> 0:7:6,63
I didn't know how I was
going to do it.


178
0:7:6,63 --> 0:7:10,12
I made a little bit of money
just hustling kids and betting


179
0:7:10,12 --> 0:7:11,23
on Mortal Kombat.


180
0:7:11,23 --> 0:7:14,0
And we had this dude who would
work a full-time job, and me


181
0:7:14,0 --> 0:7:19,15
and my homie would just take his
check and pay ourselves.


182
0:7:19,15 --> 0:7:23,4
My dad told me $350 for gas
and he'd fly me out.


183
0:7:23,4 --> 0:7:26,64
But he owned one of them
little Cessna planes.


184
0:7:26,64 --> 0:7:30,7
So I went to California on a
Cessna airplane with nothing


185
0:7:30,7 --> 0:7:33,37
but what I was wearing
and touched down.


186
0:7:33,37 --> 0:7:35,15
Jamie picked me up.


187
0:7:35,15 --> 0:7:38,21
Then it moves on to
the Riviera PB.


188
0:7:38,21 --> 0:7:40,86
Jamie Thomas, Alien House.


189
0:7:40,86 --> 0:7:42,65
Where do I hang out?


190
0:7:42,65 --> 0:7:45,72
I hang out at the Alien House,
because they drink 40s and


191
0:7:45,72 --> 0:7:47,13
play dominoes.


192
0:7:47,13 --> 0:7:49,53
And it was tight.


193
0:7:49,53 --> 0:9:49,53
