CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: This one has been circled
on a lot of calendars for a while. It`s Tuesday,


2
0:0:5,8 --> 0:0:9,83
November 6h, election day, and we`re taking
a look at how the day and the math could play


3
0:0:9,83 --> 0:0:18,36
out. I`m Carl Azuz. Let`s go.


4
0:0:18,36 --> 0:0:29,38
First up, we want to talk a bit about how
this day is going to go. For starters, it`s


5
0:0:29,38 --> 0:0:34,43
already going. In a unique election day tradition,
two New Hampshire towns started voting at


6
0:0:34,43 --> 0:0:39,6
midnight. For the rest of the country, polls
started opening up as early as 5:00 Eastern


7
0:0:39,6 --> 0:0:45,1
time this morning. By noon Eastern, voters
will be casting ballots in all 50 states.


8
0:0:45,1 --> 0:0:49,73
Polls start closing at 6:00 p.m Eastern. And
then the closings kind of move their way across


9
0:0:49,73 --> 0:0:54,149
the country. Now, voters are deciding on the
presidency, of course, but also U.S. Senate


10
0:0:54,149 --> 0:1:0,59
and House races, some governors races, state
and local elections, and proposed state laws.


11
0:1:0,59 --> 0:1:2,399
We`re going to have more on that coming up.


12
0:1:2,399 --> 0:1:8,959
The presidency is expected to be a close race.
In fact, a new CNN poll showed president Obama


13
0:1:8,959 --> 0:1:13,709
and former Governor Romney in a dead heat.
Governor Romney is scheduled to visit Ohio


14
0:1:13,709 --> 0:1:18,709
and Pennsylvania today. President Obama is
planning to spend the day in Chicago. Now,


15
0:1:18,709 --> 0:1:22,759
as the votes are counted and the election
results start coming in, both candidates are


16
0:1:22,759 --> 0:1:28,499
going to be keeping a close eye on the electoral
college count. That is the big prize today.


17
0:1:28,499 --> 0:1:30,549
Tom Foreman explains why and how this works.


18
0:1:30,549 --> 0:1:30,789
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


19
0:1:30,789 --> 0:1:34,929
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The electoral
college in its essence is basically a compromise,


20
0:1:34,929 --> 0:1:40,619
a compromise between having Congress select
all of our presidents, which Congress once


21
0:1:40,619 --> 0:1:48,599
did, and letting us by popular vote select
our presidents.


22
0:1:48,599 --> 0:1:54,39
The electoral college is what actually elects
a president. We all think we do, we don`t


23
0:1:54,39 --> 0:1:57,869
really. What we do is we vote for these people.
These people are the ones who actually have


24
0:1:57,869 --> 0:2:5,849
the vote that actuate everything, that make
it happen. Each state selects its electors


25
0:2:5,849 --> 0:2:10,939
from a bunch of the good citizenry of that
state, and they are proportional by the size


26
0:2:10,939 --> 0:2:14,73
of the congressional delegation from the states.
For example, all of your Congress members


27
0:2:14,73 --> 0:2:19,349
and your senators combined produce the number
of electoral votes you get in your state.


28
0:2:19,349 --> 0:2:24,92
So California gets a whole lot, Texas gets
a lot, Montana, North Dakota, not so much.


29
0:2:24,92 --> 0:2:30,14
The behavior of the electors is one of the
great acts of trust in this country, because


30
0:2:30,14 --> 0:2:35,2
only in a few places are they actually bound
to what the people and the population say.


31
0:2:35,2 --> 0:2:39,1
They can change their minds, and there have
been rare occasions in which electors have


32
0:2:39,1 --> 0:2:44,4
gone to the actual process of electing the
president and said, I disagree with my state,


33
0:2:44,4 --> 0:2:48,67
and they have cast another vote.


34
0:2:48,67 --> 0:2:53,9
One of the big reasons you always hear for
the electoral college is that it evens out


35
0:2:53,9 --> 0:2:59,219
power a little bit. If you just had a popular
vote, then the most populous state would really


36
0:2:59,219 --> 0:3:5,49
consolidate all the power, and if you lived
in a state like North Dakota, you would have


37
0:3:5,49 --> 0:3:9,48
very, very little influence or ability to
create any influence, unless you banded together


38
0:3:9,48 --> 0:3:15,23
with a bunch of other states. And beyond that,
all the campaigning would only happen in giant


39
0:3:15,23 --> 0:3:16,689
population centers.


40
0:3:16,689 --> 0:3:23,909
The biggest con you hear is that it can override
the popular vote. People can triangulate the


41
0:3:23,909 --> 0:3:29,69
electoral votes, and actually win the presidency
when most of the people in the country do


42
0:3:29,69 --> 0:3:31,59
not want that person in the Oval Office.


43
0:3:31,59 --> 0:3:32,45
(END VIDEOTAPE)


44
0:3:32,45 --> 0:3:37,95
AZUZ: So 435 congressional seats, plus 100
seats in the U.S. Senate and three electors


45
0:3:37,95 --> 0:3:44,28
for the District of Columbia. That all adds
up to 538 electoral college votes. It takes


46
0:3:44,28 --> 0:3:50,99
a majority of these votes, at least 270, to
win the presidency. John King looks at the


47
0:3:50,99 --> 0:3:54,79
math for both of the candidates to see how
those votes could add up to history.


48
0:3:54,79 --> 0:3:54,56
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


49
0:3:54,56 --> 0:3:59,269
JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR: Look at this. If the
president can take Iowa, can take Wisconsin


50
0:3:59,269 --> 0:4:3,989
and can take Ohio, it`s game over. If nothing
else changed on the map, that would get the


51
0:4:3,989 --> 0:4:8,359
president to 271, and it would be game over.
That`s why the president is ending his campaign


52
0:4:8,359 --> 0:4:11,609
right here in the heartland, places where
he can talk about the auto bailout. He thinks


53
0:4:11,609 --> 0:4:14,889
that`s a big plus for him. So that`s one way.
That is the president`s quickest way. I won`t


54
0:4:14,889 --> 0:4:18,93
say it`s the easiest, but it`s his easiest,
not an easy way to 270. So what does that


55
0:4:18,93 --> 0:4:21,799
mean? It means for starters, Governor Romney
has to take the state of Ohio.


56
0:4:21,799 --> 0:4:25,34
Let`s take these back and make them tossups
and show you. That was the president`s fastest


57
0:4:25,34 --> 0:4:29,479
way. How does Governor Romney get there? He
has to win the state of Florida. Not negotiable.


58
0:4:29,479 --> 0:4:33,62
Governor Romney needs Florida, he needs those
29 electoral votes. He has to take North Carolina.


59
0:4:33,62 --> 0:4:37,569
We already have it leaning that way, and he
has to take Virginia as well. That`s 13 more.


60
0:4:37,569 --> 0:4:40,88
That would get Governor Romney there. Then,
the governor`s most reasonable scenario is


61
0:4:40,88 --> 0:4:45,59
to take Ohio. No Republican has ever won without
it. If Governor Romney can get those electoral


62
0:4:45,59 --> 0:4:50,389
votes, plus Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio,
what does that do? That would get him to 266.


63
0:4:50,389 --> 0:4:54,449
Over here in the east, he would need just
one more, any one of the remaining states.


64
0:4:54,449 --> 0:4:58,86
If Governor Romney can do Florida, Virginia,
North Carolina and Ohio, any one of the remaining


65
0:4:58,86 --> 0:5:2,52
states would put him over the top. That`s
what makes this one so, so, so important.


66
0:5:2,52 --> 0:5:3,43
(END VIDEOTAPE)


67
0:5:3,43 --> 0:5:8,83
AZUZ: So who do you want to win? We`ve seen
so many polls in this race for so many weeks


68
0:5:8,83 --> 0:5:14,55
now, we`re taking our own informal poll at
cnnstudentnews.com. Tell us whether you`re


69
0:5:14,55 --> 0:5:19,479
hoping for the incumbent president, the former
governor or someone else to lead the country.


70
0:5:19,479 --> 0:5:25,3
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today`s shoutout goes out
to Mrs. McKay`s and Mrs. Miller`s language


71
0:5:25,3 --> 0:5:30,729
arts classes at Glenview Middle School in
East Moline, Illinois. In a blank, voters


72
0:5:30,729 --> 0:5:36,97
decide on a proposed government law or policy.
Is it a rebuttal, a filibuster, referendum,


73
0:5:36,97 --> 0:5:40,74
or oligarchy? You got 3 seconds, go.


74
0:5:40,74 --> 0:5:51,99
A 
referendum is a vote on a proposed law or
policy. That`s your answer and that is your


75
0:5:51,99 --> 0:5:53,0
shoutout.


76
0:5:53,0 --> 0:5:59,83
AZUZ: There is at least one referendum on
the ballot in 38 states today. All in all,


77
0:5:59,83 --> 0:6:5,229
voters will decide on almost 180 proposed
laws or policies, and that includes some pretty


78
0:6:5,229 --> 0:6:10,389
controversial issues. For example, President
Obama`s health care reform law. Four states


79
0:6:10,389 --> 0:6:15,9
are voting on whether people and businesses
can avoid the part of the law that requires


80
0:6:15,9 --> 0:6:19,37
that they purchase health care for themselves
or their employees. Voters in other states


81
0:6:19,37 --> 0:6:24,25
will be looking at proposals that involve
same-sex marriage, abortion, the death penalty


82
0:6:24,25 --> 0:6:29,659
and legalizing medical marijuana. And two
states, Washington and Georgia, have referendums


83
0:6:29,659 --> 0:6:32,569
on creation of charter schools.


84
0:6:32,569 --> 0:6:36,47
Watching the results come in on election night
is kind of like watching history as it happens.


85
0:6:36,47 --> 0:6:41,599
I mean, these are the names that wind up in
your textbooks. So as we wrap up our coverage


86
0:6:41,599 --> 0:6:46,31
of election day, we are going to take a look
back at these historic announcements.


87
0:6:46,31 --> 0:6:48,37

88
0:6:48,37 --> 0:6:54,62

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Carter told by
his pollster Pat Caddell that it is all over


91
0:7:1,449 --> 0:7:6,849
reportedly is preparing to concede defeat
to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential


92
0:7:6,849 --> 0:7:7,509
election.


93

109
0:8:30,62 --> 0:8:36,3
of Florida back to the too close to call column.

0:8:36,3 --> 0:8:45,63
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: With 270 electoral
college votes needed to be elected president,


111
0:8:45,63 --> 0:8:51,25
right now, we`ve projected President Bush
will carry 246 electoral votes, John Kerry


112

47 years old, will become the president-elect


114
