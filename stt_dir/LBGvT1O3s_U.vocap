###3 0:00:03.066,0:00:08.033
###3 We want to pass on a country that’s safe
###6 and respected and admired around the
###8 world,
###9 0:00:09.066,0:00:16.033
###9 a nation that is defended by the strongest
###13 military on earth and the best troops this
###16 0:00:17.033,0:00:20.033
###17 this world has ever known
###21 0:00:24.033,0:00:29.066
###22 But also a country that moves with
###26 confidence beyond this time of war,
###28 0:00:29.066,0:00:34.000
###29 to shape a peace that is built on the promise
###32 of freedom and dignity for every human
###34 being.
###35 0:00:36.066,0:00:39.066
###36 We believe in a generous America,
###39 0:00:39.000,0:00:42.066
###40 in a compassionate America,
###42 0:00:42.033,0:00:44.000
###43 in a tolerant America,
###44 0:00:45.033,0:00:51.033
###45 open to the dreams of an immigrant’s
###47 daughter who studies in our schools and
###49 pledges to our flag.
###51 0:00:57.000,0:01:03.033
###52 To the young boy on the south side of
###59 Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest
###62 street corner.
###66 0:01:08.033,0:01:16.066
###68 To the furniture worker’s child in North
###70 Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a
###73 scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur
###75 0:01:17.066,0:01:19.000
###76 a diplomat or even a president
###79 0:01:20.033,0:01:22.066
###81 that’s the future we hope for.
###87 0:01:23.000,0:01:26.000
###87 That’s the vision we share.
###87 0:01:26.033,0:01:35.000
###87 That’s where we need to go — forward.
###91 That’s where we need to go.
###99 0:01:38.000,0:01:43.000
###99 Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely,
###102 about how to get there.
###104 0:01:45.066,0:01:52.000
###105 As it has for more than two centuries,
###107 progress will come in fits and starts. It’s not
###110 always a straight line.
###112 0:01:52.000,0:01:54.066
###112 It’s not always a smooth path.
###114 0:01:56.033,0:02:01.033
###116 By itself, the recognition that we have
###117 common hopes and dreams won’t end all the
###120 gridlock
###120 0:02:01.033,0:02:07.033
###121 or solve all our problems or substitute for the
###124 painstaking work of building consensus
###127 0:02:08.066,0:02:17.066
###128 and making the difficult compromises needed
###130 to move this country forward. But that
###134 common bond is where we must begin.
###138 0:02:19.000,0:02:21.033
###139 Our economy is recovering
###140 0:02:22.000,0:02:23.066
###141 A decade of war is ending.
###144 0:02:24.033,0:02:27.000
###146 A long campaign is now over.
###154 0:02:35.000,0:02:45.066
###155 And whether I earned your vote or not, I
###159 have listened to you, I have learned from you,
###163 and you’ve made me a better president.
###165 0:02:46.000,0:02:53.066
###166 And with your stories and your struggles, I
###171 return to the White House
###172 0:02:53.066,0:02:59.033
###173 more determined and more inspired than ever
###175 about the work there is to do and the future
###190 that lies ahead.
###190 0:03:09.033,0:03:14.000
###191 Tonight you voted for action, not politics as
###193 usual.
###193 0:03:16.033,0:03:20.033
###193 You elected us to focus on your jobs, not
###199 ours.
###200 0:03:22.066,0:03:28.066
###201 And in the coming weeks and months, I am
###204 looking forward to reaching out and working
###207 with leaders of both parties
###208 0:03:28.066,0:03:32.066
###209 to meet the challenges we can only solve
###212 together.
###212 0:03:33.033,0:03:36.033
###213 Reducing our deficit. Reforming our tax code.
###216 0:03:36.033,0:03:44.033
###216 Fixing our immigration system. Freeing
###220 ourselves from foreign oil. We’ve got more
###226 work to do.
###229 0:03:50.066,0:03:53.066
###230 But that doesn’t mean your work is done.
###234 0:03:55.033,0:04:00.033
###235 The role of citizen in our democracy does not
###238 end with your vote.
###240 0:04:02.033,0:04:04.000
###241 America’s never been about what can be
###243 done for us.
###244 0:04:04.000,0:04:09.000
###244 It’s about what can be done by us together
###247 through the hard and frustrating,
###251 0:04:09.000,0:04:13.000
###251 but necessary work of self-government.
###255 0:04:14.000,0:04:18.000
###256 That’s the principle we were founded on.
###261 0:04:21.066,0:04:26.066
###261 This country has more wealth than any
###263 nation, but that’s not what makes us rich.
###267 0:04:27.066,0:04:31.066
###268 We have the most powerful military in history,
###270 but that’s not what makes us strong.
###272 0:04:33.033,0:04:41.000
###273 Our university, our culture are all the envy of
###277 the world, but that’s not what keeps the
###279 world coming to our shores.
###281 0:04:43.066,0:04:49.000
###283 What makes America exceptional are the
###284 bonds that hold together the most diverse
###287 nation on earth.
###289 0:04:49.000,0:04:53.000
###289 The belief that our destiny is shared; that this
###292 country only works
###294 0:04:53.000,0:04:59.066
###294 when we accept certain obligations to one
###297 another and to future generations.
###299 0:04:59.066,0:05:08.033
###299 The freedom which so many Americans have
###302 fought for and died for come with
###304 responsibilities as well as rights.
###307 0:05:08.033,0:05:13.000
###307 And among those are love and charity and
###311 duty and patriotism.
###314 0:05:13.000,0:05:17.000
###316 That’s what makes America great
###327 0:05:29.066,0:05:34.066
###329 I am hopeful tonight because I’ve seen the
###332 spirit at work in America.
###334 0:05:36.066,0:05:42.033
###335 I’ve seen it in the family business whose
###338 owners would rather cut their own pay than
###341 lay off their neighbors,
###341 0:05:43.000,0:05:47.000
###342 and in the workers who would rather cut
###344 back their hours than see a friend lose a job.
###349 0:05:49.033,0:05:57.066
###349 I’ve seen it in the soldiers who reenlist after
###352 losing a limb and in those SEALs who
###355 charged up the stairs into darkness
###358 0:05:57.066,0:06:01.066
###358 and danger because they knew there was a
###359 buddy behind them watching their back.
###363 0:06:09.000,0:06:12.000
###365 I’ve seen it on the shores of New Jersey and
###371 New York,
###372 0:06:12.033,0:06:17.033
###372 where leaders from every party and level of
###375 government have swept aside their
###377 differences
###377 0:06:17.033,0:06:21.033
###378 to help a community rebuild from the
###380 wreckage of a terrible storm.
###386 0:06:30.066,0:06:39.033
###390 And I saw just the other day, in Mentor, Ohio,
###394 where a father told the story of his 8-year-
###398 old daughter,
###399 0:06:40.000,0:06:48.066
###400 whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost
###404 their family everything had it not been for
###407 health care reform
###408 0:06:48.066,0:06:53.000
###408 passing just a few months before the
###412 insurance company was about to stop
###423 paying for her care.
###423 0:07:02.066,0:07:10.000
###423 I had an opportunity to not just talk to the
###424 father, but meet this incredible daughter of
###429 his.
###430 0:07:11.000,0:07:20.000
###431 And when he spoke to the crowd listening to
###434 that father’s story, every parent in that room
###439 had tears in their eyes,
###440 0:07:21.033,0:07:32.000
###441 because we knew that little girl could be our
###445 own. And I know that every American wants
###449 her future to be just as bright.
###452 0:07:34.033,0:07:36.000
###453 That’s who we are.
###455 0:07:37.033,0:07:41.033
###456 That’s the country I’m so proud to lead as
###459 your president.
###462 0:07:48.066,0:07:52.066
###465 And tonight, despite all the hardship we’ve
###472 been through,
###473 0:07:54.033,0:08:00.066
###474 despite all the frustrations of Washington, I’ve
###478 never been more hopeful about our future
###480 0:08:02.000,0:08:06.000
###480 I have never been more hopeful about
###485 America.
###485 0:08:07.000,0:08:11.000
###486 And I ask you to sustain that hope.
###489 0:08:11.066,0:08:14.066
###490 I’m not talking about blind optimism,
###493 0:08:14.033,0:08:20.033
###494 the kind of hope that just ignores the
###496 enormity of the tasks ahead or the
###499 roadblocks that stand in our path.
###501 0:08:22.066,0:08:29.000
###502 I’m not talking about the wishful idealism that
###505 allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk
###508 from a fight.
###509 0:08:31.033,0:08:36.000
###511 I have always believed that hope is that
###513 stubborn thing inside us that insists,
###515 0:08:36.033,0:08:38.000
###516 despite all the evidence to the contrary,
###518 0:08:38.000,0:08:45.066
###518 that something better awaits us so long as
###521 we have the courage to keep reaching, to
###523 keep working, to keep fighting.
###527 0:08:51.033,0:08:54.033
###529 America, I believe we can build on the
###533 progress we’ve made
###535 0:08:55.000,0:09:01.033
###535 and continue to fight for new jobs and new
###537 opportunity and new security for the middle
###540 class.
###541 0:09:03.000,0:09:09.000
###543 I believe we can keep the promise of our
###545 founders, the idea that if you’re willing to
###548 work hard,
###549 0:09:09.000,0:09:15.000
###549 it doesn’t matter who you are or where you
###551 come from or what you look like or where
###554 you love.
###555 0:09:15.000,0:09:17.066
###555 It doesn’t matter whether you’re black or
###557 white or
###558 0:09:17.066,0:09:27.000
###558 Hispanic or Asian or Native American or
###562 young or old or rich or poor, able, disabled,
###567 gay or straight,
###568 0:09:27.000,0:09:31.000
###569 you can make it here in America if you’re
###574 willing to try.
###575 0:09:37.033,0:09:45.066
###576 I believe we can seize this future together
###579 because we are not as divided as our politics
###584 suggests.
###585 0:09:45.033,0:09:48.033
###586 We’re not as cynical as the pundits believe.
###588 0:09:48.033,0:09:52.033
###589 We are greater than the sum of our individual
###589 ambitions,
###589 0:09:52.033,0:09:57.000
###589 and we remain more than a collection of red
###592 states and blue states.
###593 0:09:57.000,0:10:01.000
###593 We are and forever will be the United States
###594 of America.
###594 0:10:01.000,0:10:10.000
###594 And together with your help and God’s grace
###595 we will continue our journey forward and
###596 remind the world just
###596 0:10:10.000,0:10:14.066
###596 why it is that we live in the greatest nation on
###602 Earth
###603 0:10:14.066,0:10:20.066
###604 Thank you, America. God bless you. God
###610 bless these United States.
