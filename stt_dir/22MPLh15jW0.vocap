###0 STEVE SPANGLER: All right.
###0 Well, today is a good day.
###1 My chemistry teacher is coming over.
###3 I know the secret to get him over here.
###5 I want to show him a demo.
###6 All I have do is put a lot of food out, and
###7 everything is just fine.
###8 So mix up a little bit of this for lunch.
###10 This is a variation of something he taught me
###12 over 25 years ago.
###14 The old is forever new.
###15 And chances are he'll have no memory that he taught me this
###18 25 years ago.
###20 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###20 STEVE SPANGLER: I'm Steve Spangler.
###21 And I'm all about making science fun.
###23 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###26 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###29 experiences.
###30 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###33 affect the way people think about science.
###35 And to do that, I live by one motto, make it big, do it
###39 right, give it class.
###41 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###47 STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, here he is, my first chemistry teacher
###49 ever, the amazing Doug Houdus.
###51 DOUG HOUDUS: Hi, Steve.
###53 How are you?
###54 Geez, where is--
###55 I thought you said we were having lunch?
###57 STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.
###58 And I thought you were going to be here two hours ago.
###59 Did the home, the nursing home bus not pick
###62 you up on time or--
###63 DOUG HOUDUS: Well, what day is this?
###64 STEVE SPANGLER: Thank you.
###65 DOUG HOUDUS: OK.
###66 I thought this was Thursday.
###67 STEVE SPANGLER: Oh my god This is going to be a long taping.
###69 Here's what I'd like you to do.
###71 I have got a new demo for you that I thought it would be fun
###74 to show you.
###74 DOUG HOUDUS: Oh, excellent.
###75 STEVE SPANGLER: I just made it a little bit bigger in size.
###76 So, here, watch this.
###78 So it uses an Erlenmeyer flask.
###79 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###80 STEVE SPANGLER: And of course, safe science.
###81 DOUG HOUDUS: Oh, you always have to
###82 have your safety glasses.
###82 STEVE SPANGLER: Put your safety glasses on.
###84 Isn't it weird that I'm now telling you this?
###86 Isn't that strange?
###86 DOUG HOUDUS: I think it's great.
###88 STEVE SPANGLER: All right.
###89 So here's what we're going to do.
###90 There's fire, and then there's a balloon.
###92 So instead of doing the classic way,
###94 this is a water balloon.
###96 Got it?
###96 DOUG HOUDUS: Uh-huh.
###96 STEVE SPANGLER: So the object is to put the water balloon in
###98 the bottle.
###98 DOUG HOUDUS: OK.
###99 STEVE SPANGLER: So here's how we get the water balloon in
###100 the bottle.
###101 We have to have paper here.
###102 So you can light the paper on fire.
###104 I know you're pretty excited about this.
###106 But you get to be in charge of this.
###107 OK.
###107 DOUG HOUDUS: Wow.
###108 I love fire.
###108 I--
###108 STEVE SPANGLER: In today's day and age, this
###110 is how we make fires.
###110 This is--
###111 DOUG HOUDUS: We don't need a match.
###112 STEVE SPANGLER: This is a little stick that you squeeze,
###114 like magic, fire comes out.
###116 All right.
###116 So you're ready?
###117 All right.
###118 So light it up.
###119 DOUG HOUDUS: You really want to get a good,
###120 good flame, like this.
###121 STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.
###121 There you go.
###122 So a good flame that goes down inside.
###123 Nice.
###123 DOUG HOUDUS: Put that in there.
###123 Oh, perfect.
###123 STEVE SPANGLER: So this goes here like this.
###125 DOUG HOUDUS: Oh, look at it vibrate.
###126 STEVE SPANGLER: All over the [INAUDIBLE].
###127 Good.
###127 Here it goes.
###128 All right.
###128 Come on baby.
###129 Come on.
###129 [POP]
###129 DOUG HOUDUS: Oh, wow.
###130 STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.
###131 That's good, huh?
###132 DOUG HOUDUS: That's really good.
###133 STEVE SPANGLER: Because it's visual.
###134 It's huge for an audience.
###135 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###136 It's bigger.
###137 I never had a flask like this.
###138 Where did you get a flask like this?
###140 STEVE SPANGLER: Actually, from your lab, so that's why you
###142 didn't have a flask like that.
###144 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###144 STEVE SPANGLER: You know, right before you retired--
###145 DOUG HOUDUS: I was just wondering.
###145 STEVE SPANGLER: --obviously, that came to you.
###147 Now it's mine.
###148 DOUG HOUDUS: I was wondering if we could do it--
###150 STEVE SPANGLER: When you had your--
###151 DOUG HOUDUS: -- the old traditional one.
###151 STEVE SPANGLER: -- that's all you had.
###152 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###153 But I think everybody would like to see the traditional
###155 one with the egg going into the bottle.
###157 Is that possible?
###158 STEVE SPANGLER: It's pretty easy.
###159 You just take an egg and put it in the bottle.
###160 DOUG HOUDUS: Ohh, no, no, no.
###160 STEVE SPANGLER: How hard is that?
###162 DOUG HOUDUS: What I want you to see is this.
###163 And don't take your eyes away from it.
###165 I want you see that egg actually going bla, la, loo,
###167 loo, loo, a little fluttering.
###168 STEVE SPANGLER: How does that go?
###169 DOUG HOUDUS: Bla, la, loo, loo, loo.
###170 Can you do that?
###171 STEVE SPANGLER: No.
###171 I can't.
###171 DOUG HOUDUS: [INAUDIBLE].
###172 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###174 And what is the fluttering action that we're seeing?
###176 DOUG HOUDUS: Well, let's actually see
###177 how this takes place.
###178 STEVE SPANGLER: All right.
###179 DOUG HOUDUS: And then we want do the experiment of course
###180 first and the explanation second.
###183 STEVE SPANGLER: You know what this is?
###183 This is a fuse--
###185 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###185 STEVE SPANGLER: -- so that you'll get going with this.
###186 All right.
###186 DOUG HOUDUS: Gotta get it going.
###187 OK.
###187 Now watch this.
###188 STEVE SPANGLER: Good.
###188 Good.
###189 [POP]
###190 DOUG HOUDUS: It didn't flutter.
###192 STEVE SPANGLER: It didn't?
###193 There was a little bit of flutter.
###194 I saw that.
###195 DOUG HOUDUS: No, there was not.
###195 STEVE SPANGLER: Video will show there was a little
###197 fluttering.
###198 DOUG HOUDUS: Watch this.
###199 STEVE SPANGLER: Good.
###201 [GROWLING SOUND]
###202 [POP]
###206 DOUG HOUDUS: It didn't flutter.
###208 STEVE SPANGLER: It didn't?
###209 There is a little bit of flutter.
###210 I saw that--
###210 DOUG HOUDUS: No, there was not.
###211 STEVE SPANGLER: Video will show there was a little
###213 fluttering.
###213 And I liked your way of getting it in.
###215 So, again, just as a quick review.
###218 The hot air that was inside, as soon as you put the fire
###221 that goes down inside, you now have all that
###224 air that heats up.
###225 As the air heats up, just as we saw with the balloon and a
###227 little bit with this, you see the air escaping
###229 from the very top.
###230 Then when the fire goes out, that warm air inside begins to
###233 cool, contract.
###235 And the outside air pressure pushes the
###237 egg into the bottle.
###237 DOUG HOUDUS: Well, the gravity, also,
###239 because the egg has mass.
###241 And why I was trying to get a little bit more
###242 fluttering in there--
###243 STEVE SPANGLER: Did you just say gravity to me?
###244 Yes, the egg will fall into the bottle.
###246 But don't you think the air is pushing it in more than
###249 gravity is pulling it down?
###252 Here let's see how well--
###252 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###253 STEVE SPANGLER: -- gravity works.
###254 DOUG HOUDUS: Wait.
###255 STEVE SPANGLER: Let's just sit here and wait for gravity.
###257 Hmmm.
###257 Wonder how well gravity is doing?
###259 DOUG HOUDUS: No.
###259 STEVE SPANGLER: All that gravity is pretty good.
###261 DOUG HOUDUS: No.
###262 Yeah.
###262 You were right.
###262 STEVE SPANGLER: Doug, I got another way to put the egg
###264 inside the bottle.
###265 It's the upside down egg in the bottle.
###267 DOUG HOUDUS: No, it won't work.
###267 STEVE SPANGLER: It is.
###267 Watch this.
###268 DOUG HOUDUS: No, un-uh.
###270 STEVE SPANGLER: So new Erlenmeyer flask.
###271 DOUG HOUDUS: OK.
###272 STEVE SPANGLER: Got it.
###272 And let's find an egg this time that actually seals all
###274 the way around.
###275 All right.
###275 DOUG HOUDUS: [INAUDIBLE].
###276 STEVE SPANGLER: So why don't we look and see if this--
###277 DOUG HOUDUS: OK.
###277 STEVE SPANGLER: You just want to make sure there's a seal
###278 all the way around.
###279 OK.
###280 Perfect.
###281 In fact, that would be even better.
###283 OK.
###283 So now watch.
###285 So now instead of putting paper inside because you got
###287 to warm up the air inside.
###288 You--
###288 DOUG HOUDUS: Absolutely.
###288 STEVE SPANGLER: -- want the air to escape.
###290 So now we just simply put birthday candles
###293 down inside like this.
###294 DOUG HOUDUS: OK.
###295 Got it.
###295 STEVE SPANGLER: So here's a little birthday candle.
###297 And here's your birthday candle.
###298 DOUG HOUDUS: Can I light it this time, Steve?
###300 STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.
###301 DOUG HOUDUS: All right.
###301 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###302 Here we go.
###302 Ready?
###303 DOUG HOUDUS: All right.
###303 STEVE SPANGLER: This goes over the top.
###304 Watch how it works.
###305 It's here like this.
###306 DOUG HOUDUS: So we're going to heat that air up inside again.
###306 STEVE SPANGLER: [INAUDIBLE] air like this.
###307 Watch.
###307 See the fluttering?
###308 DOUG HOUDUS: [INAUDIBLE] the air.
###309 STEVE SPANGLER: Watch when it goes out.
###310 It's going to go out.
###311 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah?
###312 [POP]
###312 DOUG HOUDUS: Amazing.
###313 STEVE SPANGLER: Ta-da!
###314 DOUG HOUDUS: So the air heated up.
###316 STEVE SPANGLER: Upside down egg in the bottle.
###318 Pops up.
###319 You could actually feel the little fluttering
###321 that's going on.
###321 DOUG HOUDUS: So I guess maybe it's just the air heating up
###324 instead of the gravity doing it.
###326 STEVE SPANGLER: I don't think gravity has anything to do
###328 with this, Doug.
###329 It's not--
###330 DOUG HOUDUS: [INAUDIBLE].
###330 STEVE SPANGLER: -- a gravity thing.
###332 Why did you say gravity?
###333 DOUG HOUDUS: I just wanted to say gravity.
###336 STEVE SPANGLER: I don't know why you would say gravity.
###339 DOUG HOUDUS: I [INAUDIBLE]
###340 STEVE SPANGLER: We got to get the egg out.
###341 DOUG HOUDUS: OK.
###341 STEVE SPANGLER: And the way you get the egg out is you
###342 just take a knife, and you kind of cut it up inside--
###345 DOUG HOUDUS: No, no, no.
###346 We don't want to do that.
###347 That's not a scientific way of doing it.
###348 Remember, we had a decrease in air pressure, OK, and that
###351 made the egg actually fall in or get sucked into the bottle.
###356 Now we want to is just the opposite.
###357 STEVE SPANGLER: I'm so proud.
###357 That's exactly what was on the script, and he remembered.
###360 DOUG HOUDUS: We're both going to blow into the bottle.
###362 STEVE SPANGLER: Right.
###362 DOUG HOUDUS: And we're going to create extra air in here,
###364 extra air pressure--
###365 STEVE SPANGLER: So you push the air that's in here.
###366 DOUG HOUDUS: -- and that's going to blow it out.
###367 STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.
###367 And then air comes out.
###368 DOUG HOUDUS: But what happens if we get the egg caught in
###370 our throat?
###371 STEVE SPANGLER: I don't know.
###372 You choke.
###373 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###373 But does anybody in here know the Heimlich Maneuver?
###376 STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, I do.
###376 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###377 But you'll be doing the egg.
###378 STEVE SPANGLER: I'll help you.
###379 DOUG HOUDUS: OK.
###379 STEVE SPANGLER: I've got your back.
###380 DOUG HOUDUS: OK.
###380 You got me back?
###382 STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.
###382 DOUG HOUDUS: OK.
###383 STEVE SPANGLER: So you're ready?
###384 This is a race?
###385 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###386 Wait.
###386 Three, two--
###387 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, I say, three, two, one, go.
###388 OK?
###388 Ready?
###389 Three, two, one, go.
###391 [SWOOSH]
###392 STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, perfect.
###394 And this is my egg right out of there.
###397 The most amazing thing that can happen along the--
###400 oh, oh, I'm sorry.
###401 DOUG HOUDUS: Ahh.
###404 Ohh.
###405 Oh, my own student saved my life.
###408 Oh, I am so thankful you were here, Steve.
###411 You are my hero.
###412 Give me five.
###413 Oh.
###416 STEVE SPANGLER: I think it's going well.
###418 Here's what I'm afraid.
###419 In all the kind of having fun, that we might have missed the
###422 actual science behind this.
###423 So let's do it again using what people would normally
###426 probably use.
###426 DOUG HOUDUS: [INAUDIBLE].
###427 STEVE SPANGLER: In fact, I have to tell you that this
###428 technique was really shared by Don Herbert, so Mr. Wizard
###431 shared it with me in about 1997 or 1998 at Sacred Heart
###435 University when he was doing a presentation.
###438 He said that over the years that he found that a water
###440 balloon worked even better than that.
###442 So I made this water balloon.
###444 Of course, it's bigger, and it would be impossible to push it
###446 in the bottle.
###447 One of the reasons why is because there's
###448 air inside the bottle.
###449 So when you push down like this, you can't get it down
###452 inside the bottle.
###452 DOUG HOUDUS: You're forcing the air.
###453 STEVE SPANGLER: Correct.
###454 So the object here is this, is if we use the fire here like
###457 this, and we heat it up, as you heat up the air, the
###460 molecules will move away from each other.
###463 It forces the hot air out.
###464 That's the fluttering that you said that you saw before.
###466 And then when it cools down, as soon as this goes out, you
###469 see, it cools down, the air contracts, and the outside air
###472 pressure kind of pushes down inside.
###473 DOUG HOUDUS: That air goes up 30 miles, and
###474 it's pushing down.
###475 STEVE SPANGLER: Tremendous amount.
###476 And the other secret here is sometimes I'll get this a
###478 little wet just so that it will slip past here a little
###481 bit easier.
###481 DOUG HOUDUS: That's an [INAUDIBLE] idea.
###482 STEVE SPANGLER: That's kind of what's going on there.
###483 You handle the fire.
###484 DOUG HOUDUS: I will.
###484 STEVE SPANGLER: And we'll do it together.
###485 Ready?
###485 DOUG HOUDUS: All right.
###486 STEVE SPANGLER: So this goes in.
###486 We're going to get this burning pretty well because we
###488 need to have that fire down inside.
###489 And you'll actually see the fluttering here.
###491 So this goes in.
###491 DOUG HOUDUS: We want to heat up that air
###492 inside really good.
###493 STEVE SPANGLER: So listen, hear the fluttering?
###495 [BANG]
###495 DOUG HOUDUS: Whoa.
###496 Wow.
###497 STEVE SPANGLER: Bam.
###497 Isn't that a great one?
###499 DOUG HOUDUS: That is excellent.
###500 I think much more dramatic.
###501 STEVE SPANGLER: Now the kicker here is getting it out.
###504 Using the egg, you can kind of blow in and
###506 kind of get it out.
###506 But I have not found good success this way.
###508 And it's fun to have people try to do it like this, so
###511 it's almost like a bet.
###513 DOUG HOUDUS: Oh, yeah.
###514 STEVE SPANGLER: Can you get the balloon out?
###516 DOUG HOUDUS: You're creating a slight vacuum back here when
###517 you're doing that.
###518 STEVE SPANGLER: Right.
###518 So I could say, I'll give you $20 if you can get the balloon
###521 out of the bottle.
###523 DOUG HOUDUS: How about $100?
###524 STEVE SPANGLER: How about $20?
###525 All right.
###526 So how would you do that, Doug?
###528 DOUG HOUDUS: I think if you had something like a straw,
###530 you could actually put it along the side here.
###532 STEVE SPANGLER: Look at what your star student has.
###534 DOUG HOUDUS: Wow.
###534 STEVE SPANGLER: A straw.
###535 DOUG HOUDUS: Where did you get that at?
###536 STEVE SPANGLER: Watch this.
###538 So here we go.
###539 We push this down here like this.
###541 DOUG HOUDUS: Yes.
###542 STEVE SPANGLER: All your--
###543 [SHHHHH]
###543 STEVE SPANGLER: Did you hear that little shhhh there?
###544 DOUG HOUDUS: Yes.
###545 STEVE SPANGLER: So now watch.
###546 If we stick a straw down inside like this.
###548 OK.
###548 And this is here.
###550 DOUG HOUDUS: Ahhh.
###550 You're going to avoid that vacuum creation, huh.
###552 STEVE SPANGLER: So now if we pull like this, we should be
###555 able to let the air come in and the balloon come out.
###559 [POP]
###559 STEVE SPANGLER: Ahh.
###560 DOUG HOUDUS: Don't you just love science?
###561 STEVE SPANGLER: Isn't that good?
###562 But there's something you need to know.
###563 You don't have to use fire to get the egg into the bottle.
###566 Here's the solution, 320 degrees below zero.
###570 So we had heat.
###571 This time why don't we go to extreme cold.
###573 And this is perfect.
###575 So this is our bath of liquid nitrogen.
###577 And unlike using the other bottles that we were playing
###579 with before, you have to use an Erlenmeyer
###581 flask for this one.
###582 Got it?
###582 DOUG HOUDUS: That's because it won't crack.
###584 STEVE SPANGLER: So here's what we're going to do with this.
###586 If we got it hot on the first time, and it forced the air
###589 out, and then when it cooled down, the outside pressure
###592 pushed it in, why don't we start with the air at room
###595 temperature, put this on top, and submerge it in here, get
###598 it cold, and see if the contraction will allow that to
###600 push it in?
###600 DOUG HOUDUS: So we're going to see if some of those molecules
###602 will actually come a little bit closer,
###603 creating a partial vacuum.
###604 STEVE SPANGLER: All right.
###605 You're ready?
###605 This goes on top here like this.
###607 And now we put it in the liquid nitrogen like this.
###611 Make sure that we've got a good seal.
###613 It's getting colder.
###615 It's getting colder.
###616 Doug, it's working.
###618 DOUG HOUDUS: It is.
###619 STEVE SPANGLER: Bam.
###619 DOUG HOUDUS: Excellent.
###620 STEVE SPANGLER: That is how to get the egg--
###623 DOUG HOUDUS: Very, very cool.
###623 STEVE SPANGLER: -- in the bottle.
###624 Isn't that cool?
###625 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###625 STEVE SPANGLER: Sticking to the bottle.
###626 [BANG, BANG]
###627 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah, it is.
###628 Maybe because it's cold.
###628 STEVE SPANGLER: There it is, bingo.
###630 Here's a cool thing.
###630 You could possibly get the egg back out of the bottle.
###633 You have to warm this part of it up.
###635 DOUG HOUDUS: OK.
###636 STEVE SPANGLER: Do you do pretty good clucking?
###637 Can you go [CLUCKS LIKE ?
###639 CHICKEN].
###640 DOUG HOUDUS: Do I have to scratch while I'm doing that?
###643 STEVE SPANGLER: Can you do--
###644 DOUG HOUDUS: [CLUCKS LIKE A CHICKEN].
###644 STEVE SPANGLER: Hold on to this.
###645 Hold onto this.
###645 And just make chicken sounds.
###646 Hold on right here.
###646 DOUG HOUDUS: [CLUCKS LIKE A CHICKEN]
###648 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###648 Hold onto it.
###649 You can do it.
###649 DOUG HOUDUS: OK.
###650 We've got to warm this up and increase the
###652 pressure, right at this--
###653 STEVE SPANGLER: Just warm it up.
###654 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###654 STEVE SPANGLER: Use our hands.
###655 Warm it.
###655 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###656 Use your hands.
###657 STEVE SPANGLER: Come on.
###657 Come on.
###658 [CLUCKING LIKE CHICKENS]
###660 DOUG HOUDUS: Maybe if I scratch a little bit.
###663 [CLUCKING LIKE CHICKENS]
###673 STEVE SPANGLER: Come on.
###674 Do it harder.
###675 [CLUCKING LIKE CHICKENS]
###676 STEVE SPANGLER: Ahh.
###677 DOUG HOUDUS: It did--
###678 [COUGHS].
###678 STEVE SPANGLER: Isn't that great?
###679 Are you OK?
###680 DOUG HOUDUS: Yeah.
###680 I have a cold, see.
###681 STEVE SPANGLER: This is your lunch.
###682 DOUG HOUDUS: Wait a minute.
###684 STEVE SPANGLER: There you go.
###684 There's your lunch.
###684 DOUG HOUDUS: Thank you.
###685 STEVE SPANGLER: Thank you.
###685 DOUG HOUDUS: This is what I came here for?
###686 STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, guess what I hear right now?
###687 Beep, beep.
###688 Oh, that's the bus.
###689 The bus is here.
###690 DOUG HOUDUS: Oh, it is?
###691 Will I be going back to the home?
###692 STEVE SPANGLER: [SINGING]
###693 The wheels on the bus go round and round--
###695 DOUG HOUDUS: [SINGING]
###695 Round and round--
###696 STEVE SPANGLER: Goodbye, Doug.
###697 See you later.
###697 DOUG HOUDUS: -- and the wipers on the--
