4
0:0:16,69 --> 0:0:19,25
SIMON OSTROVSKY: We've seen a
lot of settlers, and we've


5
0:0:19,25 --> 0:0:21,77
seen their settlements and their
homes, but we really


6
0:0:21,77 --> 0:0:24,46
haven't got the Palestinian
perspective at all.


7
0:0:24,46 --> 0:0:26,77
And apparently, the Palestinians
are often


8
0:0:26,77 --> 0:0:28,17
attacked by settlers.


9
0:0:28,17 --> 0:0:30,83
So we've come to this town,
Asira al-Qibliya, to get their


10
0:0:30,83 --> 0:0:32,65
perspective on things.


11
0:0:32,65 --> 0:0:35,45
This is the end of the road in
this Palestinian town, so


12
0:0:35,45 --> 0:0:38,89
these houses here are the ones
that are closest to the Jewish


13
0:0:38,89 --> 0:0:40,14
settlement up the hill.


14
0:0:40,14 --> 0:0:43,37
And they face the brunt of the
attacks when the settlers come


15
0:0:43,37 --> 0:0:44,84
down throwing stones.


16
0:0:44,84 --> 0:0:46,97
And the owners of some of these
houses are telling us


17
0:0:46,97 --> 0:0:49,57
that the Israeli army doesn't
do anything about it.

21
0:1:0,725 --> 0:1:26,37



22
0:1:26,37 --> 0:1:28,41
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He showed us
videos he'd taken himself of


23
0:1:28,41 --> 0:1:31,45
the settler attacks where you
could see youths come down


24
0:1:31,45 --> 0:1:35,78
from the settlement above the
village to throw stones.


25
0:1:35,78 --> 0:1:38,59
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


26
0:1:38,59 --> 0:1:41,1
The worst thing about it was
that they were accompanied by


27
0:1:41,1 --> 0:1:44,35
the Israeli army, who were
supposedly there to separate


28
0:1:44,35 --> 0:1:47,72
the two groups but were in fact
doing nothing to stop the


29
0:1:47,72 --> 0:1:49,142
settler attack.


30
0:1:49,142 --> 0:1:50,99
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


31
0:1:50,99 --> 0:1:55,35



32
0:1:55,35 --> 0:1:58,77
A few weeks after we visited
Asira al-Qibliya, the settler


33
0:1:58,77 --> 0:1:59,77
attacks resumed.


34
0:1:59,77 --> 0:2:3,13
But this time, two Palestinian
villagers who were throwing


35
0:2:3,13 --> 0:2:6,14
stones and approaching Jewish
youths were shot by the


36
0:2:6,14 --> 0:2:10,669
settlers with live ammunition
during two separate attacks.


37
0:2:10,669 --> 0:2:13,46
Both times, the Israeli
army did nothing to


38
0:2:13,46 --> 0:2:15,87
restrain the settlers.


39
0:2:15,87 --> 0:2:18,145
Fortunately though,
both men survived.


40
0:2:18,145 --> 0:2:21,33



41
0:2:21,33 --> 0:2:22,58
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


42
0:2:22,58 --> 0:2:44,54



43
0:2:44,54 --> 0:2:47,35
SIMON OSTROVSKY: The situation
was obviously very tense and


44
0:2:47,35 --> 0:2:50,74
very dangerous, but this wasn't
the only place under a


45
0:2:50,74 --> 0:2:52,53
fair bit of pressure.


46
0:2:52,53 --> 0:2:55,85
The Migron settlement is one
of the few Jewish outposts


47
0:2:55,85 --> 0:2:58,96
that have received clear-cut
court orders to be totally


48
0:2:58,96 --> 0:3:0,29
dismantled.


49
0:3:0,29 --> 0:3:3,74
This is Migron, an illegal
outpost, and Israel has


50
0:3:3,74 --> 0:3:6,74
ordered all of this to be
demolished in a few months.


51
0:3:6,74 --> 0:3:9,77
So it's got a bit of a
Deliverance vibe going on, not


52
0:3:9,77 --> 0:3:12,57
so much because there's a lot
of hillbillies out here but


53
0:3:12,57 --> 0:3:14,68
they're about to flood
the valley.


54
0:3:14,68 --> 0:3:17,81
Migron has seen some of its
structures knocked down by the


55
0:3:17,81 --> 0:3:21,5
Israeli authorities before, but
this time, Israel's high


56
0:3:21,5 --> 0:3:24,6
court has ordered that the
entire place be destroyed


57
0:3:24,6 --> 0:3:27,44
because it was illegally built
on Palestinian land.


58
0:3:27,44 --> 0:3:30,81



59
0:3:30,81 --> 0:3:34,62
It's a very unusual ruling, and
most Palestinians see it


60
0:3:34,62 --> 0:3:37,74
as a one-off rather than a
reversal of settlement policy


61
0:3:37,74 --> 0:3:39,39
in the West Bank.


62
0:3:39,39 --> 0:3:41,88
I spoke to one of the residents
to find out how she


63
0:3:41,88 --> 0:3:44,56
felt about the impending
demolition.


64
0:3:44,56 --> 0:3:48,29
Do you sympathize with
Palestinian people who also


65
0:3:48,29 --> 0:3:51,56
see their houses get demolished
under Israeli


66
0:3:51,56 --> 0:3:52,9
bulldozers?


67
0:3:52,9 --> 0:3:55,83
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I see it from
another point of view.


68
0:3:55,83 --> 0:3:57,99
I think it's a different
story.


69
0:3:57,99 --> 0:4:0,94
Here, nobody killed anyone.


70
0:4:0,94 --> 0:4:6,232
Israel destroying a house
for Palestinians


71
0:4:6,232 --> 0:4:9,32
is not for no reason.


72
0:4:9,32 --> 0:4:15,48
Most of the times, it's
because they did


73
0:4:15,48 --> 0:4:18,19
a very wrong thing.


74
0:4:18,19 --> 0:4:21,579
People killing people
and other things.


75
0:4:21,579 --> 0:4:24,83
The story here is that the
families did nothing.


76
0:4:24,83 --> 0:4:26,47
It's not that I don't
feel sorry.


77
0:4:26,47 --> 0:4:27,16
I do.


78
0:4:27,16 --> 0:4:32,6
But I more feel sorry about my
own people that sits under


79
0:4:32,6 --> 0:4:35,48
attacks every day, and we
see it all the time.


80
0:4:35,48 --> 0:4:37,51
SIMON OSTROVSKY: So right now
must be a really difficult


81
0:4:37,51 --> 0:4:41,56
time for the residents of Migron
because the high court


82
0:4:41,56 --> 0:4:45,35
of Israel has stated pretty
finally that by August, they


83
0:4:45,35 --> 0:4:47,6
want all of this to
be demolished.


84
0:4:47,6 --> 0:4:48,92
Do you know what you're
going to do?


85
0:4:48,92 --> 0:4:51,92
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: We believe
that we won't be in the


86
0:4:51,92 --> 0:4:56,177
street, and we work with the
government to find a solution


87
0:4:56,177 --> 0:4:57,427
for this hard situation.


88
0:4:57,427 --> 0:4:59,93



89
0:4:59,93 --> 0:5:1,92
SIMON OSTROVSKY: It's easy to
get bogged down in the legal


90
0:5:1,92 --> 0:5:5,54
details of the status of each
individual settlement, but the


91
0:5:5,54 --> 0:5:8,8
important thing to remember is
that while some sites face the


92
0:5:8,8 --> 0:5:11,98
chopping block, the total number
of settlers in the West


93
0:5:11,98 --> 0:5:15,78
Bank has grown from just 12,000
in the early '80s to


94
0:5:15,78 --> 0:5:17,96
over 300,000 today.


95
0:5:17,96 --> 0:5:21,45
And that figure doesn't even
include a further 200,000


96
0:5:21,45 --> 0:5:24,28
Israelis living in East
Jerusalem, according to the


97
0:5:24,28 --> 0:5:26,26
activist group Peace Now.


98
0:5:26,26 --> 0:5:28,78
Many have begun asking
themselves if it's even


99
0:5:28,78 --> 0:5:31,69
possible for a Palestinian
state to emerge from a


100
0:5:31,69 --> 0:5:34,73
territory crisscrossed with
Jewish settlements.


101
0:5:34,73 --> 0:5:37,74
A couple of miles down the road
from Migron just across a


102
0:5:37,74 --> 0:5:41,0
small valley, we saw a shack
with a couple of teenagers


103
0:5:41,0 --> 0:5:43,71
poking their head out of the
door to see who we were.


104
0:5:43,71 --> 0:5:46,9
It turned out that the
shantytown of [INAUDIBLE]


105
0:5:46,9 --> 0:5:48,85
was yet another unauthorized
outpost.


106
0:5:48,85 --> 0:5:51,96
The place isn't marked on any
map, but already it's been


107
0:5:51,96 --> 0:5:54,72
demolished and rebuilt
a few times over.


108
0:5:54,72 --> 0:5:58,1
These kids were without
any adult supervision.


109
0:5:58,1 --> 0:6:0,67
They told me they've named the
place Strength of Zion.


110
0:6:0,67 --> 0:6:4,34



111
0:6:4,34 --> 0:6:6,16
Wow, it's really basic.


112
0:6:6,16 --> 0:6:7,36
There's not even a floor.


113
0:6:7,36 --> 0:6:8,61
It's just the grass here.


114
0:6:8,61 --> 0:6:10,59
You've got holes in the roof.


115
0:6:10,59 --> 0:6:12,49
It's rained today.


116
0:6:12,49 --> 0:6:26,79



117
0:6:26,79 --> 0:6:28,61
SIMON OSTROVSKY: This has
been totally incredible.


118
0:6:28,61 --> 0:6:32,11
This is the freshest, most
radical outpost that we've


119
0:6:32,11 --> 0:6:33,79
visited so far.


120
0:6:33,79 --> 0:6:36,32
The crazy thing about it is
that the more you talk to


121
0:6:36,32 --> 0:6:39,18
these guys, the more somebody
tells you that God has given


122
0:6:39,18 --> 0:6:42,19
them this land, that there
is no two ways around it.


123
0:6:42,19 --> 0:6:46,38
You start to believe them and
get to the point where you


124
0:6:46,38 --> 0:6:51,84
think a peaceful settlement
is almost impossible.


125
0:6:51,84 --> 0:6:54,6
With so many settlements being
built up on the future


126
0:6:54,6 --> 0:6:58,21
territory of the Palestinian
state, you start to wonder if


127
0:6:58,21 --> 0:7:1,6
Israel is working to make the
two-state solution a reality,


128
0:7:1,6 --> 0:7:4,53
or if it's just telling the
international community what


129
0:7:4,53 --> 0:7:5,8
it wants to hear.


130
0:7:5,8 --> 0:7:10,24
The more Israelis move to the
West Bank, the less viable a


131
0:7:10,24 --> 0:7:13,33
Palestinian state seems to be.


132
0:7:13,33 --> 0:7:16,6
So the real question becomes
whether Palestinians will end


133
0:7:16,6 --> 0:7:20,49
up citizens of a greater Israel
with equal rights or if


134
0:7:20,49 --> 0:7:25,72
they face a permanent regime
of occupation.


135
0:7:25,72 --> 0:9:25,72
