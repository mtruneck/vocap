local population, including
civilians, from their


11
0:1:7,42 --> 0:1:11,74
stronghold located in Aleppo's
13th century citadel.

0:1:11,74 --> 0:1:15,29
From their elevated positions,
Assad's forces fired into the


13
0:1:15,29 --> 0:1:18,4
old city, devastating the
area controlled by

NARRATOR: As the best preserved
souk in the Middle


32
0:2:44,18 --> 0:2:46,69
East burned, I met with vendors
and fighters with the


33
0:2:46,69 --> 0:2:49,8
Free Syrian Army as they helped
small business owners


34
0:2:49,8 --> 0:2:53,58
salvage silks, spices, and
perfumes from their scorched


35
0:2:53,58 --> 0:2:54,83

47
0:3:51,98 --> 0:3:53,37
lost forever.


48

The destruction of such a
significant cultural relic


49
0:3:56,41 --> 0:3:59,98
further undermines any notion of
understanding and peace in


50
