###23 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: A big thanks to Mr. Merrill students for getting things started
###30 today, we have a packed show, so let`s go ahead and get to it.
###35 First up, hearings on Capitol Hill. Now, you are not going to see any pictures from these
###39 hearings, and you are not going to hear anything that was said in them, either. That is because
###43 these are closed hearings. That means no members of the media, no members of the public are
###47 allowed in.
###49 We do know what they are about, though. This -- the attack on the U.S. facility in Benghazi,
###55 Libya. It happened just over two months ago, the members of Congress who are running the
###59 hearings have questions about how the attacks happened and what happened afterward. And
###63 they are hoping to get answers. Martha Shade has more on who`ll be at the hearings and
###68 what issues are expected to come up.
###69 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###70 MARTHA SHADE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Several of Washington`s power players will be on Capitol
###73 Hill, expecting to be grilled about the deadly consulate attack in Benghazi, Libya. U.S.
###78 ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the September 11th assault.
###84 Former CIA director David Petraeus is scheduled to address this Senate House Intelligence
###88 Committee, his testimony was in question after his sudden resignation last week.
###92 REP. PATRICK MEEHAN, (R ), PENNSYLVANIA: He is necessary, he understands and was there
###95 during the time when the Benghazi events occurred.
###99 SHADE: Some Republicans have been going after U.N. ambassador Susan Rice. After the violence,
###105 she said intelligence pointed to a spontaneous, not pre-planned attack. Senator John McCain
###110 said Rice was deceptive, while Lindsey Graham just doesn`t trust her.
###114 SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R ), SOUTH CAROLINA: And the reason I don`t trust her, is because
###117 I think she knew better, and if she didn`t know better she shouldn`t be the voice of
###120 America.
###121 SHADE: President Barack Obama had a message to the senators in Rice`s defense.
###125 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: If Senator McCain and Senator
###128 Graham and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me, and I`m happy to
###135 have that discussion with them.
###137 SHADE: The senators oppose Rice possibly being nominated to secretary of state to replace
###142 Hillary Clinton, and say they will do whatever they can do to block it.
###146 Senator Rand Paul says he is no fun of Rice, but there are bigger issues at play.
###150 SEN. RAND PAUL, (R ), KENTUCKY: But I think the more important question is, why were there
###152 no Marines guarding our ambassador.
###154 SHADE: Who made that decision, is likely to be discussed during these hearings. I`m Martha
###159 Shade reporting.

###162 AZUZ: Next stop, we are looking at a fine, not just any old fine, the largest criminal
###167 fine in U.S. history: it`s $1.2 billion, and the company that`s paying it, is BP. You might
###174 remember this: an explosion in 2010 in a BP oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. A massive oil
###180 spill that leaked more than 200 million gallons of oil into the water. And the serious environmental
###186 problems when some of that oil washed up along the U.S. Gulf coast. Yesterday, BP reached
###191 the settlement with the U.S. government. The company will pay $4.5 billion. That includes
###197 the record fine, and it covers other criminal charges and government penalties. BP has already
###202 agreed to pay 20 billion to cover damages from the spill, and nearly 8 billion to private
###208 victims. For perspective in a two year since the oil spill happened, BP has made $43 billion
###214 in profits.
###215 You`ve heard this talk about this fiscal cliff. It`s a series automatic government spending
###220 cuts and tax increases that could hit Americans next year, if Congress and President Obama
###226 don`t figure out a way around them. Here is a look at how the fiscal cliff could impact
###231 education: school districts nationwide would have less money, so after school programs,
###236 enrichment programs, sports could be cut. More teachers could lose their jobs or get
###241 paid less. And many schools wouldn`t be able to make needed repairs, upgrade computers
###246 or get new textbooks. Because so many schools have been struggling with less money after
###251 the recession hit, this fiscal cliff could make things worse: and that`s why so many
###255 people in education are paying attention to what happens as Congress and the president
###260 try to find the solution.

###263 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See, if you can ID me. I`m a country that`s been around for centuries,
###270 but I established my current Communist form of government in 1949. I`m one of the world`s
###276 largest nations in size. And I`m the largest in population.
###282 I`m China and I`m home to more than 1.3 billion people.
###289 (END VIDEOCLIP)
###291 AZUZ: There`s been a change at the top of China`s Communist Party. In the U.S., presidential
###297 candidates are out in public all the time. That`s not how things work in China. When
###301 that country`s leadership goes through a transition, it all happens behind closed doors. These
###306 seven men are those new leaders. They make up the most powerful committee in the Chinese
###311 government. And the one who is front and center, is Xi Jinping, he is the new head of China`s
###317 Communist Party and is expected to lead the country for the next ten years. A lot of other
###321 nations are wondering, what to expect from Xi in this committee. That`s because in addition
###326 to having the world`s biggest population, China also has the world`s second biggest
###330 economy. That means it has a lot of influence on the world`s economic issues.
###335 Back into U.S., 13 deaths have been reported to the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration.
###341 The reports say that those 13 people died after using a supplement called "5-hour Energy."
###346 The FDA launched an investigation, it`s required to by law. But it also says, that a report
###352 by itself doesn`t mean that a product is responsible for health issue. So far, connection between
###358 the deaths and 5-hour Energy hasn`t been established. One thing the FDA is likely looking at is
###364 caffeine. One 5-hour Energy has 207 milligrams of caffeine. To compare, a cup of coffee can
###371 have anywhere from 95 to 200 milligrams. A regular can of Red Bull has about 80 milligrams.
###377 Dr. Sanjay Gupta is CNN`s chief medical correspondent. He was talking to a colleague recently, and
###383 this other doctor brought up an issue that he described as the biggest manmade epidemic
###387 in the United States. He was talking about accidental death from overdoses. But not from
###392 illegal drugs, from prescription drugs. Accidental overdoses are the number one cause of accidental
###399 death in America. We talked to Dr. Gupta about ways to prevent this, and some of the surprising
###404 numbers associated with the issue.
###406 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###407 DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Carl, I think the statistics that gets everyone`s
###410 attention here, is that every 90 minutes in this country, someone dies from an accidental
###416 overdose of prescription drugs. You keep that in mind, and I think that tells you a large
###420 tale. And also, if you look at the world, and you think about young people and old people
###424 alike, 80 percent of the world`s pain pills are taken in the United States. We prescribe
###429 enough to give every man, woman and child a doze every 4 hours for three weeks. So,
###434 look, we are talking a lot about this, but best advice: if you have pain pills in your
###438 medicine cabinet, get rid of them.
###440 People have a preconceived notion of who this people are that are dying, but oftentimes
###444 it`s your friends, your families, your neighbors, it`s not people who you would think of as
###448 addicts. There are people who have legitimate pain that need to have those pain concerns
###451 addressed. Don`t misuse these pills, and ask yourself, every time you are given a prescription,
###456 do I really need this? Hopefully, that`s going to help a lot of people, Carl. Back to you.

###461 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today "Shoutout" goes out to Mr. Love`s journalism technology student
###467 at Sandpoint High School in Sand Point, Idaho.
###471 Francis Scott Key wrote the lyrics o which of these songs? You know what to do, is it
###477 "My Country "Tis of Thee." "America the Beautiful," God Bless America" or the "Star-Spangled Banner."
###483 You`ve got three seconds, go!
###491 Key wrote the lyrics to the "Star-Spangled Banner" during the war of 1812. That`s your
###497 answer and that`s your "Shoutout."
###499 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###501 AZUZ: You might expect to hear the "Star-Spangled Banner" before a sports event, that tradition
###505 is connected to some controversy in part of Pennsylvania. The commissioner in charge of
###510 high school hockey emailed teams and suggested that they not sing the anthem. He says it`s
###516 not a question of patriotism, it`s a concern about costs.
###520 High school hockey rents ice time for games, so every game is carefully timed. When time
###525 runs out, the game ends, even if the clock hasn`t hit zero. If the singer takes longer
###530 with the national anthem, it eats into that game time. Some people aren`t happy with the
###535 idea of skipping the national anthem. They`ve suggested extending the time for the game
###539 or cutting time somewhere else. One person suggested using a pre- recorded rendition
###544 of the anthems, so you always know how long it will be.
###547 Tile, linoleum, marble, carpet, hardwood, there are a lot of types of floors. But the
###553 owner of this business in Pittsburgh went a different route: she paid pennies for her
###558 flooring, actually, she didn`t pay them, she used them. 250,000 pennies took her and some
###564 volunteers about 300 hours to lay it all down, but she said it`s actually a lot cheaper than
###570 paying for tile. So, how do you make a floor from all these? I guess, you lay the pennies
###575 down and then start linking them together.
###577 Suppose, if you don`t want to be ordinary that`s certainly on the way to change. You
###581 imagine when the customers walking and see it, though. They are going to be floored.
###584 They might not be able to make sense of it, but I know just how to ask them for their
###588 opinions. Penny for your thoughts? All right, that`s all the puns we can handle for now.
###591 I hope you have a great weekend.
