We're gonna dive into some of 
the marvels of DNA


2
0:0:11,455 --> 0:0:15,151
and its stupid design and talk 
about ERV's with Dr.

0:0:36,881 --> 0:0:39,517
Welcome! To this episode of 
Genesis Week, the


6
0:0:39,517 --> 0:0:42,69
weekly program of creationary 
commentary on news,


7
0:0:42,69 --> 0:0:44,181
views and events pertaining to 
the origins


8
0:0:44,181 --> 0:0:46,613
controversy, made possible by 
the supporters of


9
0:0:46,613 --> 0:0:48,933
CORE Ottawa, Citizens for 
Origins Research and


10
0:0:48,933 --> 0:0:51,805
Education, and now carried on 
the Christianima


11
0:0:51,805 --> 0:0:54,789
network - christianima.com - 
Christian cinema at


12
0:0:54,789 --> 0:0:57,989
its finest. Excellence in pirate
broadcasting, we


13
0:0:57,989 --> 0:1:0,269
took over my best friend's 
garage for our studio


14
0:1:0,269 --> 0:1:2,122
today so we could continue to 
bring you the


15
0:1:2,122 --> 0:1:4,657
information the anticreationists
don't want you to


16
0:1:4,657 --> 0:1:7,561
see or hear, and giving glory to
our Creator while


17
0:1:7,561 --> 0:1:11,605
doing it. The Bible does NOT say
"Put on therefore,


18
0:1:11,605 --> 0:1:14,413
as the elect of God, holy and 
beloved, bowels of


19
0:1:14,413 --> 0:1:19,597
mercies, kindness, numbness of 
mind..." No! God


20
0:1:19,597 --> 0:1:22,301
gave you a brain, we here at 
Genesis Week presume


21
0:1:22,301 --> 0:1:25,397
it's because He wants you to use
it! Remember if


22
0:1:25,397 --> 0:1:27,553
you get lost in cyberspace, you 
can just punch in


23
0:1:27,553 --> 0:1:30,361
wazooloo.com or genesisweek.com 
and you can find


24
0:1:30,361 --> 0:1:32,937
us, and also subscribe to our 
youtube channel to

26
0:1:35,457 --> 0:1:38,825
with our guests. I'm your host, 
Ian Juby. 


27
0:1:38,825 --> 0:1:42,689
You'll recall a few episodes 
back I discussed a


28
0:1:42,689 --> 0:1:45,897
NATURE interview with Dr. Steven
Benner who


29
0:1:45,897 --> 0:1:50,538
described DNA as a "Stupid 
design." Well nature had


30
0:1:50,538 --> 0:1:52,809
a couple of papers out this past
week on the


31
0:1:52,809 --> 0:1:55,977
marvels of DNA and its design. 
The first one was


32
0:1:55,977 --> 0:1:59,41
from researchers at the Max 
Planck Institute of


33
0:1:59,41 --> 0:2:1,549
Biochemistry who detailed a 
ring-like protein which


34
0:2:1,549 --> 0:2:7,269
holds the DNA into its compact 
bundles. Now at


35
0:2:7,269 --> 0:2:11,493
first, you may say "Who cares?" 
But you need to


36
0:2:11,493 --> 0:2:15,701
understand the significance of 
this bundling. Your


37
0:2:15,701 --> 0:2:20,269
DNA would be about 2 meters 
long, yet it is so


38
0:2:20,269 --> 0:2:23,733
tightly and carefully wound up 
that it fits into


39
0:2:23,733 --> 0:2:29,849
chromosomes only 1 or 2 
MILLIONTHS of a meter. If


40
0:2:29,849 --> 0:2:33,169
you took all of the DNA in your 
body, unwound all


41
0:2:33,169 --> 0:2:37,169
the strands and laid them end to
end, they could go


42
0:2:37,169 --> 0:2:44,929
to the moon and back over 
100,000 times. And yet,


43
0:2:44,929 --> 0:2:48,641
the complex bundling and 
packaging system is so


44
0:2:48,641 --> 0:2:52,853
efficient, that all the DNA in 
your body can fit


45
0:2:52,853 --> 0:2:55,229
in a teaspoon.


46
0:2:55,229 --> 0:2:58,181
Anyone who has ever packaged the
good old string of


47
0:2:58,181 --> 0:3:1,461
christmas lights knows the 
importance of packaging


48
0:3:1,461 --> 0:3:4,685
the light strings properly, or -
it costs you an


49
0:3:4,685 --> 0:3:8,845
incredible amount of work. So 
now compare your DNA


50
0:3:8,845 --> 0:3:13,433
to a string of christmas lights 
thousands of miles


51
0:3:13,433 --> 0:3:16,761
long, and you can quickly see 
the importance of


52
0:3:16,761 --> 0:3:20,81
keeping it very carefully 
bundled when it's not in


53
0:3:20,81 --> 0:3:25,9
use! This is why there are all 
of these complex


54
0:3:25,9 --> 0:3:29,625
bundling systems involved with 
the DNA. There are


55
0:3:29,625 --> 0:3:33,449
molecular machines who very 
carefully and


56
0:3:33,449 --> 0:3:38,741
meticulously bundle the DNA. 
Guess where the plans


57
0:3:38,741 --> 0:3:42,109
for those machines comes from? 
You guessed it


58
0:3:42,109 --> 0:3:43,981
- the DNA.


59
0:3:43,981 --> 0:3:48,533
When it comes to DNA, life is on
the line. While


60
0:3:48,533 --> 0:3:51,509
you need to have all these 
systems for keeping DNA


61
0:3:51,509 --> 0:3:55,357
controlled and tightly wound up,
cell division must


62
0:3:55,357 --> 0:4:1,81
take place. So the DNA must be 
unwound, a second


63
0:4:1,81 --> 0:4:5,297
copy made, and the copies 
properly and evenly


64
0:4:5,297 --> 0:4:10,329
distributed to the two cells 
dividing off. That's


65
0:4:10,329 --> 0:4:14,153
where these ring proteins come 
in. These are only


66
0:4:14,153 --> 0:4:18,921
ONE of many, many required 
complex tools and parts


67
0:4:18,921 --> 0:4:24,253
for handling the very important 
DNA. So which came


68
0:4:24,253 --> 0:4:28,957
first: The rings which hold the 
DNA together, or


69
0:4:28,957 --> 0:4:32,301
the DNA which contains the plans
for the rings


70
0:4:32,301 --> 0:4:36,61
which are needed to hold the DNA
together? Or the


71
0:4:36,61 --> 0:4:41,469
machines which read the DNA and 
make the rings? Or


72
0:4:41,469 --> 0:4:44,517
the machines which install the 
rings, very


73
0:4:44,517 --> 0:4:49,65
carefully and methodically wind 
and unwind the DNA?


74
0:4:49,65 --> 0:4:52,417
The plans for those machines 
come from the DNA, but


75
0:4:52,417 --> 0:4:56,945
still yet other machines make 
those machines, based


76
0:4:56,945 --> 0:5:1,81
on plans from the DNA. The plans
for ALL of these


77
0:5:1,81 --> 0:5:4,721
machines comes from the DNA - 
including the


78
0:5:4,721 --> 0:5:9,465
machines that make the DNA. So 
which one came


79
0:5:9,465 --> 0:5:13,405
first? It's a nonsense question 
to ask which came


80
0:5:13,405 --> 0:5:17,165
first, because the correct 
answer is they all came


81
0:5:17,165 --> 0:5:21,789
about at the same time! Like any
factory, these


82
0:5:21,789 --> 0:5:26,805
different systems were DESIGNED.
What an incredible


83
0:5:26,805 --> 0:5:31,357
designer - our best minds and 
technology cannot


84
0:5:31,357 --> 0:5:36,393
produce even crude renditions of
these system. All


85
0:5:36,393 --> 0:5:39,25
of our best minds - all of our 
most incredible


86
0:5:39,25 --> 0:5:43,329
intelligence pales in comparison
to the astonishing


87
0:5:43,329 --> 0:5:47,25
intelligence and design that 
went into DNA and the


88
0:5:47,25 --> 0:5:51,441
machines that read it. Our 
Creator is truly


89
0:5:51,441 --> 0:5:54,94
an awesome God!


90
0:5:54,94 --> 0:5:57,55
But wait - wait - DNA was 
supposed to be a stupid


91
0:5:57,55 --> 0:6:0,35
design right? Not according the 
researchers


92
0:6:0,35 --> 0:6:3,954
attempting to use DNA in place 
of hard drive


93
0:6:3,954 --> 0:6:6,65
storage! Publishing their paper 
in the journal -


94
0:6:6,65 --> 0:6:11,834
NATURE, Goldman et al., used 
synthetic DNA as a


95
0:6:11,834 --> 0:6:17,26
man-made digital storage medium 
- using DNA instead


96
0:6:17,26 --> 0:6:20,611
of a hard drive, CD ROM, or 
flash stick.


97
0:6:20,611 --> 0:6:24,954
Effectively, that is what your 
DNA is - think of it


98
0:6:24,954 --> 0:6:28,206
like the hard drives that store 
the program on how


99
0:6:28,206 --> 0:6:30,534
to build you.


100
0:6:30,534 --> 0:6:35,166
So Goldman et al took that 
concept and ran with it:


101
0:6:35,166 --> 0:6:39,678
they made a strand of DNA which 
contained digitally


102
0:6:39,678 --> 0:6:43,838
encoded files: They recorded all
of Shakespeare's


103
0:6:43,838 --> 0:6:48,13
sonnets, a PDF copy of Watson 
and Crick's original


104
0:6:48,13 --> 0:6:52,33
paper describing the structure 
of DNA, a JPG


105
0:6:52,33 --> 0:6:54,787
photograph of the research 
institute that produced


106
0:6:54,787 --> 0:7:0,258
the synthetic DNA, a 26 second 
MP3 of Martin Luther


107
0:7:0,258 --> 0:7:5,458
King's "I have a dream" speech, 
and the code that


108
0:7:5,458 --> 0:7:8,603
was used to convert all of those
digital files into


109
0:7:8,603 --> 0:7:13,532
a DNA sequence! All of this was 
recorded onto what


110
0:7:13,532 --> 0:7:17,684
can only be described as a speck
of dust, which the


111
0:7:17,684 --> 0:7:20,572
researchers are confident can be
stored in cool,


112
0:7:20,572 --> 0:7:24,748
dry locations, preserving the 
digital data for tens


113
0:7:24,748 --> 0:7:27,932
of thousands of years!


114
0:7:27,932 --> 0:7:31,292
This truly is some marvelous 
engineering on their


115
0:7:31,292 --> 0:7:35,944
part, but obviously DNA is not a
stupid design,


116
0:7:35,944 --> 0:7:38,68
seeing as how the researchers 
went to great lengths


117
0:7:38,68 --> 0:7:43,57
extoling the benefits of digital
storage on DNA,


118
0:7:43,57 --> 0:7:45,448
and its reliability.


119
0:7:45,448 --> 0:7:49,128
What's even more remarkable is 
when you look at how


120
0:7:49,128 --> 0:7:53,696
DNA is actually used in biology,
as it relates to


121
0:7:53,696 --> 0:7:58,68
digital storage. For example, 
imagine reading


122
0:7:58,68 --> 0:8:1,949
information off of your hard 
drive. You start at


123
0:8:1,949 --> 0:8:6,7
sector 1 and read your file. If 
your hard drive was


124
0:8:6,7 --> 0:8:9,956
written like DNA is, you could 
also start in the


125
0:8:9,956 --> 0:8:13,676
middle of sector 1, read through
until the middle


126
0:8:13,676 --> 0:8:17,908
of sector 2, and get OTHER 
information - that's


127
0:8:17,908 --> 0:8:20,976
right, completely different 
information is


128
0:8:20,976 --> 0:8:25,88
superimposed on the letters on 
the hard drive of


129
0:8:25,88 --> 0:8:30,24
sector 1. It would be like 
having this line of


130
0:8:30,24 --> 0:8:34,152
instructions being the first 
three steps of


131
0:8:34,152 --> 0:8:36,712
assembling a machine:


132
0:8:36,712 --> 0:8:41,56
Our first two instructions 
actually overlap and are


133
0:8:41,56 --> 0:8:44,408
superimposed upon each other. 
You can decipher the


134
0:8:44,408 --> 0:8:59,569
instructions if you know where 
to start and stop:


135
0:8:59,569 --> 0:9:5,106
So you provide more instructions
with fewer letters


136
0:9:5,106 --> 0:9:11,75
- your instructions take LESS 
SPACE. And that is


137
0:9:11,75 --> 0:9:14,18
how the DNA is written. A lot of
imformation is


138
0:9:14,18 --> 0:9:18,162
actually superimposed upon other
strings of letters


139
0:9:18,162 --> 0:9:20,314
in the DNA!


140
0:9:20,314 --> 0:9:22,786
As has now been discovered, 
other portions of the


141
0:9:22,786 --> 0:9:27,359
DNA direct the reading of other 
portions of the DNA


142
0:9:27,359 --> 0:9:31,511
so that, in our example 
sentence, we can extract a


143
0:9:31,511 --> 0:9:35,686
third step in the assembly 
instructions. The


144
0:9:35,686 --> 0:9:39,726
numbers on the end dictate how 
to extract the third


145
0:9:39,726 --> 0:9:43,447
assembly instruction from 
seemingly random places


146
0:9:43,447 --> 0:9:47,479
in the original information, by 
telling us to


147
0:9:47,479 --> 0:9:50,878
collect the specific words by 
their position


148
0:9:50,878 --> 0:9:59,495
in the string:


149
0:9:59,495 --> 0:10:4,674
Yet in the DNA, that extra 
directing information -


150
0:10:4,674 --> 0:10:8,36
those seemingly meaningless 
numbers, make up some


151
0:10:8,36 --> 0:10:14,472
98% of your DNA! It was called 
"junk DNA" because


152
0:10:14,472 --> 0:10:18,631
it didn't seem to do anything 
directly! We are only


153
0:10:18,631 --> 0:10:22,88
now beginning to unravel how the
"junk DNA" is used


154
0:10:22,88 --> 0:10:26,692
- and it's mind bogglingly 
complex!


155
0:10:26,692 --> 0:10:30,52
Our best computer programmers on
earth would be


156
0:10:30,52 --> 0:10:33,916
hard pressed to write programs 
with overlapping


157
0:10:33,916 --> 0:10:38,228
lines of code, other sections of
code which direct


158
0:10:38,228 --> 0:10:42,344
how to retrieve more 
instructions from random


159
0:10:42,344 --> 0:10:46,296
locations in the overall code, 
etc... and if a


160
0:10:46,296 --> 0:10:49,784
computer programmer did such a 
thing, we'd call


161
0:10:49,784 --> 0:10:53,28
them a genius. We certainly 
wouldn't say their code


162
0:10:53,28 --> 0:10:57,705
was a stupid design - unless we 
were ignorant of


163
0:10:57,705 --> 0:11:0,472
what they were doing.


164
0:11:0,472 --> 0:11:7,36
So here we see Goldman et. al. 
using DNA to do


165
0:11:7,36 --> 0:11:11,492
exactly what it does in nature: 
Communicate and


166
0:11:11,492 --> 0:11:15,884
transmit information. No one is 
suggesting that


167
0:11:15,884 --> 0:11:19,14
this man-made DNA happened by 
unguided processes.


168
0:11:19,14 --> 0:11:22,93
Everyone is acknowledging it was
intelligently


169
0:11:22,93 --> 0:11:25,248
assembled. So why is it then 
that some would


170
0:11:25,248 --> 0:11:28,88
suggest that OUR DNA was NOT 
intelligently


171
0:11:28,88 --> 0:11:32,568
assembled? I'll tell you why - 
philosophical


172
0:11:32,568 --> 0:11:36,856
reasons only. No one has ever 
seen DNA assemble


173
0:11:36,856 --> 0:11:41,352
itself and compile information 
out of nothingness.


174
0:11:41,352 --> 0:11:44,712
Information has only ever been 
observed to come


175
0:11:44,712 --> 0:11:48,4
from information. That's a 
scientific fact. In fact


176
0:11:48,4 --> 0:11:52,36
I would dare say that DNA has 
only ever been


177
0:11:52,36 --> 0:11:55,532
observed to arise from DNA! 
Think about it.


178
0:11:55,532 --> 0:11:59,916
Intelligence has only ever been 
observed to come


179
0:11:59,916 --> 0:12:3,828
from intelligence, therefore the
intelligence that


180
0:12:3,828 --> 0:12:7,364
went into the incredible design 
of our DNA is the


181
0:12:7,364 --> 0:12:11,812
ultimate in intelligence, 
because after decades of


182
0:12:11,812 --> 0:12:16,232
mind-bogglingly complex research
and study, we


183
0:12:16,232 --> 0:12:20,4
STILL haven't found out the 
entirety of how our


184
0:12:20,4 --> 0:12:24,32
computer program, our DNA, is 
used.


185
0:12:24,32 --> 0:12:27,64
That ultimate intelligence is, I
would suggest,


186
0:12:27,64 --> 0:12:31,24
Christ Jesus, our Creator. His 
incredible


187
0:12:31,24 --> 0:12:34,736
intelligence in baffling the 
pharisees, saducees


188
0:12:34,736 --> 0:12:38,516
and those attempting to trap him
in His words, that


189
0:12:38,516 --> 0:12:42,508
intelligence He showed was only 
a scratch on the


190
0:12:42,508 --> 0:12:46,636
surface of his ultimate 
intelligence.


191
0:12:46,636 --> 0:12:51,676
Speaking of alleged "junk DNA" -
ERV's were in the


192
0:12:51,676 --> 0:12:54,37
news again this past week. 
Researchers from the


193
0:12:54,37 --> 0:12:57,429
University of Massachusetts 
published a paper in


194
0:12:57,429 --> 0:13:0,805
the journal Retrovirology, 
showing that an ERV


195
0:13:0,805 --> 0:13:4,605
played a role in the production 
of our stem cells.


196
0:13:4,605 --> 0:13:7,825
Stem cells are found in various 
places throughout


197
0:13:7,825 --> 0:13:12,409
the body and are crucial to 
development, as stem


198
0:13:12,409 --> 0:13:15,137
cells can turn into pretty much 
any cell that your


199
0:13:15,137 --> 0:13:19,745
body needs. The researchers 
claimed this ERV was


200
0:13:19,745 --> 0:13:22,913
"millions of years old," and 
notice what the


201
0:13:22,913 --> 0:13:24,857
researchers said in their 
interview with


202
0:13:24,857 --> 0:13:43,804
ScienceDaily:


203
0:13:43,804 --> 0:13:46,716
I know, I know what you're 
thinking - Come on Ian -


204
0:13:46,716 --> 0:13:50,148
what on earth is an ERV? To help
us understand this


205
0:13:50,148 --> 0:13:52,94
technical subject, Dr. Jean 
Lightner has joined me


206
0:13:52,94 --> 0:13:57,48
via skype. Dr. Lightner obtained
her bachelor's


207
0:13:57,48 --> 0:14:0,792
degree in agriculture, earned a 
masters and DVM in


208
0:14:0,792 --> 0:14:3,312
Veterinarian medicine, all from 
Ohio State


209
0:14:3,312 --> 0:14:6,184
University. She is an excellent 
communicator and


210
0:14:6,184 --> 0:14:8,36
I'm thrilled to have her join me
today  welcome


211
0:14:8,36 --> 0:14:9,912
to the show Dr. Lightner. 


212
0:14:9,912 --> 0:14:11,313
>>Why thank you Ian


213
0:14:11,313 --> 0:14:13,98
>>So let's start off with that 
question  - just


214
0:14:13,98 --> 0:14:18,131
what is an ERV and how does it 
relate to


215
0:14:18,131 --> 0:14:20,467
the creation/evolution debate?


216
0:14:20,467 --> 0:14:24,803
>>An ERV is an endogenous 
retrovirus. In order to


217
0:14:24,803 --> 0:14:27,475
understand what that is, we 
should probably talk


218
0:14:27,475 --> 0:14:29,939
about what a retrovirus is. 
There are several


219
0:14:29,939 --> 0:14:32,363
different kinds of viruses, all 
pretty much contain


220
0:14:32,363 --> 0:14:35,99
a protein outside, a coat, and 
inside they have a


221
0:14:35,99 --> 0:14:37,951
nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA.


222
0:14:37,951 --> 0:14:42,191
>>RNA is one half of the DNA 
ladder.


223
0:14:42,191 --> 0:14:45,983
>>Essentially. Retroviruses have
RNA on the inside.


224
0:14:45,983 --> 0:14:50,255
When they infect a cell the RNA 
is injected into


225
0:14:50,255 --> 0:14:52,855
the host cell. Then it does 
something very


226
0:14:52,855 --> 0:14:55,975
interesting. Usually we think of
DNA being


227
0:14:55,975 --> 0:15:0,39
transcribed into RNA which is 
translated into


228
0:15:0,39 --> 0:15:2,979
proteins. However, with the RNA 
from the


229
0:15:2,979 --> 0:15:6,227
retrovirus, it does something 
kind of backwards.


230
0:15:6,227 --> 0:15:9,731
The RNA is used as a template to
make new DNA that


231
0:15:9,731 --> 0:15:12,995
then becomes part of the host 
DNA. This is reverse


232
0:15:12,995 --> 0:15:16,203
transcription, which is where 
the retro term comes


233
0:15:16,203 --> 0:15:19,723
from. So a retrovirus is 
something outside a cell


234
0:15:19,723 --> 0:15:22,523
which infects a cell. The RNA is
reverse


235
0:15:22,523 --> 0:15:26,33
transcribed back into DNA. Then 
when the host


236
0:15:26,33 --> 0:15:29,271
transcribes its own DNA it will 
copy the virus DNA


237
0:15:29,271 --> 0:15:32,255
as well. Then it will make new 
viruses. Then you


238
0:15:32,255 --> 0:15:34,599
will have a whole bunch of new 
viruses to go and


239
0:15:34,599 --> 0:15:36,655
infect other cells. 


240
0:15:36,655 --> 0:15:39,463
There are some specific features
of a retrovirus


241
0:15:39,463 --> 0:15:42,287
sequence that help us to 
identify it. For example


242
0:15:42,287 --> 0:15:45,774
on either end are long terminal 
repeats (LTRs).


243
0:15:45,774 --> 0:15:48,896
This is repetitive DNA. In 
between are several


244
0:15:48,896 --> 0:15:52,688
specific genes. When we started 
looking at sequence


245
0:15:52,688 --> 0:15:55,688
data from the DNA of various 
creatures, such as


246
0:15:55,688 --> 0:15:58,8
humans or animals, we found 
patterns that looked


247
0:15:58,8 --> 0:16:2,641
like the result of retrovirus 
infections. However,


248
0:16:2,641 --> 0:16:4,916
these sequences are part of the 
DNA that is passed


249
0:16:4,916 --> 0:16:7,844
down from parent to offspring. 
It is these


250
0:16:7,844 --> 0:16:12,412
sequences which are called 
endogenous retroviruses


251
0:16:12,412 --> 0:16:13,902
(ERVs). 


252
0:16:13,902 --> 0:16:17,327
>>OK. So can you briefly clarify
how we know the


253
0:16:17,327 --> 0:16:21,419
difference between a retrovirus 
and endogenous


254
0:16:21,419 --> 0:16:23,843
retrovirus (ERV)?


255
0:16:23,843 --> 0:16:26,339
>>With a regular retroviral 
infection, some of the


256
0:16:26,339 --> 0:16:28,995
cells in the body are infected, 
but these cells do


257
0:16:28,995 --> 0:16:32,435
not pass information on to the 
offspring. With an


258
0:16:32,435 --> 0:16:35,835
endogenous retroviral sequence, 
it appears similar


259
0:16:35,835 --> 0:16:38,675
to a retroviral sequence but it 
is found in all


260
0:16:38,675 --> 0:16:41,227
cells of the body and is passed 
on to the


261
0:16:41,227 --> 0:16:44,583
offspring. Many of these 
sequences have patterns in


262
0:16:44,583 --> 0:16:47,799
them that look like damage from 
an ancient


263
0:16:47,799 --> 0:16:50,415
infection because they do not 
code for all the


264
0:16:50,415 --> 0:16:54,79
necessary components to make an 
active virus. Often


265
0:16:54,79 --> 0:16:56,727
there are many copies of them, 
which makes it look


266
0:16:56,727 --> 0:16:59,503
like they have spread in the DNA
in the past.


267
0:16:59,503 --> 0:17:2,39
>>So how does it relate to


268
0:17:2,39 --> 0:17:4,327
the creation/evolution debate?


269
0:17:4,327 --> 0:17:8,167
>>If we assume that these ERV 
sequences are really


270
0:17:8,167 --> 0:17:11,227
from a past infection in the 
germ line and if we


271
0:17:11,227 --> 0:17:14,499
assume that the retroviral 
sequences are inserted


272
0:17:14,499 --> 0:17:18,91
essentially randomly, then when 
we find an ERV


273
0:17:18,91 --> 0:17:21,395
sequence that is very similar in
the same position


274
0:17:21,395 --> 0:17:23,851
in two different animals it 
would make sense that


275
0:17:23,851 --> 0:17:26,875
this came from an infection that
happened in one


276
0:17:26,875 --> 0:17:29,267
of their ancestors.


277
0:17:29,267 --> 0:17:31,763
So evolutionists were really 
excited when they


278
0:17:31,763 --> 0:17:34,655
found out that humans and other 
primates share


279
0:17:34,655 --> 0:17:38,36
similar ERV sequences in the 
same position. To them


280
0:17:38,36 --> 0:17:41,847
that was proof that humans and 
other primate had to


281
0:17:41,847 --> 0:17:45,503
share a common ancestor. It 
seemed they were best


282
0:17:45,503 --> 0:17:49,175
explained as an infection in a 
common ancestor.


283
0:17:49,175 --> 0:17:51,983
>>Now I like the way Dr. Joseph 
Mastropaolo put it:


284
0:17:51,983 --> 0:17:56,183
I mean typically a virus infects
a specific type of


285
0:17:56,183 --> 0:18:0,115
cell or area in the DNA, so you 
and I getting the


286
0:18:0,115 --> 0:18:4,115
same flu does not make us 
relatives


287
0:18:4,115 --> 0:18:6,987
>>True enough. And that is a 
good point, perhaps


288
0:18:6,987 --> 0:18:9,531
those sequences got there 
independently in


289
0:18:9,531 --> 0:18:11,755
humans and primates.


290
0:18:11,755 --> 0:18:14,699
>>What are some of the problems 
with this thinking


291
0:18:14,699 --> 0:18:17,443
that ERV's are, in fact,


292
0:18:17,443 --> 0:18:21,103
evidence of viral infection and 
more importantly,


293
0:18:21,103 --> 0:18:23,567
evidence of evolution?


294
0:18:23,567 --> 0:18:26,991
>>As I mentioned, ERVs were 
believed to be junk


295
0:18:26,991 --> 0:18:30,599
DNA. If ERVs were left over from
an ancient viral


296
0:18:30,599 --> 0:18:33,927
infection, they certainly 
wouldn’t be expected to


297
0:18:33,927 --> 0:18:36,383
carry out important functions. 


298
0:18:36,383 --> 0:18:39,687
The problem is that more recent 
research has shown


299
0:18:39,687 --> 0:18:42,599
that these portions of DNA are 
transcribed at


300
0:18:42,599 --> 0:18:46,707
specific times in specific 
tissues. They appear to


301
0:18:46,707 --> 0:18:50,171
be important in a number of 
different ways.


302
0:18:50,171 --> 0:18:53,3
There is an excellent 
creationist article


303
0:18:53,3 --> 0:18:56,707
highlighting this. In 2009 Dr. 
Liu and Dr. Soper


304
0:18:56,707 --> 0:18:58,907
published an interesting article
in the Answers


305
0:18:58,907 --> 0:19:2,243
Research Journal entitled: The 
Natural History of


306
0:19:2,243 --> 0:19:8,807
Retroviruses: Exogenization vs 
Endogenization. In


307
0:19:8,807 --> 0:19:12,327
it, they cite research 
documenting ERVs directly


308
0:19:12,327 --> 0:19:15,391
coding for proteins, and others 
associated with


309
0:19:15,391 --> 0:19:18,639
gene regulation, DNA repair and 
recombination, and


310
0:19:18,639 --> 0:19:22,431
transduction (making copies onto
RNA and then


311
0:19:22,431 --> 0:19:27,95
reverse transcribing them 
somewhere else in


312
0:19:27,95 --> 0:19:30,666
the DNA).


313
0:19:30,666 --> 0:19:34,2
Basically, they hypothesize that
things actually


314
0:19:34,2 --> 0:19:37,393
went the other direction. 
Retroviruses appeared


315
0:19:37,393 --> 0:19:40,25
when these mobile elements 
within the


316
0:19:40,25 --> 0:19:43,109
genome escaped. 


317
0:19:43,109 --> 0:19:48,421
>>So in other words ERV's 
weren't caused by virus


318
0:19:48,421 --> 0:19:54,973
genes, but rather virus genes 
came from ERV's?


319
0:19:54,973 --> 0:19:58,965
>>It appears so. One of the 
biggest problems for


320
0:19:58,965 --> 0:20:2,401
the earlier claims that these 
are evidence for


321
0:20:2,401 --> 0:20:4,642
evolution is that ERVs have been
shown to have


322
0:20:4,642 --> 0:20:7,977
essential roles in reproduction 
and development. 


323
0:20:7,977 --> 0:20:11,417
So how did the primate ancestor 
reproduce while it


324
0:20:11,417 --> 0:20:14,233
was waiting for the germline 
retroviral infection? 


325
0:20:14,233 --> 0:20:16,817
>>Ya  like it brings whole new 
meaning to


326
0:20:16,817 --> 0:20:19,859
“Honey, I don't have a 
headache.” This is a


327
0:20:19,859 --> 0:20:23,746
critical point  this is the 
reproductive system.


328
0:20:23,746 --> 0:20:28,869
So effectively, without this 
alleged ERV, no


329
0:20:28,869 --> 0:20:32,957
reproduction, therefore, 
extinction of the species.


330
0:20:32,957 --> 0:20:36,997
>>It would seem so. Instead of 
these sequences


331
0:20:36,997 --> 0:20:39,285
being the result of an ancient 
infection, it seems


332
0:20:39,285 --> 0:20:42,326
more logical that they were 
created for a purpose.


333
0:20:42,326 --> 0:20:44,703
The article by Liu and Soper 
make a good


334
0:20:44,703 --> 0:20:46,566
case for this.


335
0:20:46,566 --> 0:20:49,578
I mentioned earlier two 
assumptions. The first is


336
0:20:49,578 --> 0:20:52,681
that these sequences were the 
result of germline


337
0:20:52,681 --> 0:20:54,929
infections in the distant past. 
We have just


338
0:20:54,929 --> 0:20:58,361
discussed why this may not be 
the case. The second


339
0:20:58,361 --> 0:21:2,65
is that they insert essentially 
randomly. A more


340
0:21:2,65 --> 0:21:7,553
recent article by Santoni et al.
challenges this.


341
0:21:7,553 --> 0:21:10,609
Not only did they find a human 
ERV associated with


342
0:21:10,609 --> 0:21:13,441
an essential part of 
development, but they also


343
0:21:13,441 --> 0:21:16,341
found that the placement of 
these sequences were


344
0:21:16,341 --> 0:21:19,285
associated with certain 
epigenetic markers. 


345
0:21:19,285 --> 0:21:23,405
>>For the sake of the viewers, 
if I may interrupt,


346
0:21:23,405 --> 0:21:29,253
epigenetics is sort of the 
controlling of genes


347
0:21:29,253 --> 0:21:34,269
with other genetic “switches,” 
which are called


348
0:21:34,269 --> 0:21:37,877
epigenetic markers. So just 
think of epigenetic


349
0:21:37,877 --> 0:21:42,169
markers as switches that turn on
or off certain


350
0:21:42,169 --> 0:21:45,753
portions of the DNA. Sorry Jean 
- I just had to


351
0:21:45,753 --> 0:21:49,65
throw something in to make 
myself look smart. Carry


352
0:21:49,65 --> 0:21:51,545
on with what you were saying. 
{laughing}


353
0:21:51,545 --> 0:21:54,602
>>In this case the epigenetic 
marker was a specific


354
0:21:54,602 --> 0:21:59,281
histone. Histones are special 
proteins the DNA is


355
0:21:59,281 --> 0:22:2,729
wrapped around that affect how 
exposed the section


356
0:22:2,729 --> 0:22:7,777
of DNA is so it can be 
translated. So the Santoni


357
0:22:7,777 --> 0:22:13,158
et al paper indicates that this 
type of ERV in


358
0:22:13,158 --> 0:22:16,477
humans is less randomly arranged
than


359
0:22:16,477 --> 0:22:18,469
we had thought.


360
0:22:18,469 --> 0:22:20,573
Sometimes the word random can 
just mean we don’t


361
0:22:20,573 --> 0:22:22,821
understand yet why the pattern 
is there.


362
0:22:22,821 --> 0:22:25,565
Now there are times where ERVs 
are associated with


363
0:22:25,565 --> 0:22:28,375
disease. In fact, we often 
discover the problems


364
0:22:28,375 --> 0:22:30,669
associated with something before
we really


365
0:22:30,669 --> 0:22:33,753
understand the importance of 
that something. This


366
0:22:33,753 --> 0:22:38,777
was true of bacteria. Because 
they were found to be


367
0:22:38,777 --> 0:22:41,537
associated with disease, many 
had assumed they were


368
0:22:41,537 --> 0:22:44,618
always bad. It turns out this is
not the case. Most


369
0:22:44,618 --> 0:22:48,241
are not harmful. In fact many 
are essential for


370
0:22:48,241 --> 0:22:52,249
life on earth. It looks like the
same may be true


371
0:22:52,249 --> 0:22:56,341
of ERVs and other mobile genetic
elements. 


372
0:22:56,341 --> 0:22:59,109
>>Well that is fascinating Dr. 
Lightner, I really


373
0:22:59,109 --> 0:23:1,133
appreciate your taking the time 
to be on the show


374
0:23:1,133 --> 0:23:3,797
today, I know the viewers will 
appreciate it too,


375
0:23:3,797 --> 0:23:6,325
so for all of us, thank you for 
being with us


376
0:23:6,325 --> 0:23:7,885

377
0:23:7,885 --> 0:23:9,525
>>Okay - thank you for having 
me.


378
0:23:9,525 --> 0:23:11,637
>>Stick around, we'll be right 
back after this


379
0:23:11,637 --> 0:23:13,653
break that is so short, your 
viruses won't even

390
0:23:39,1 --> 0:23:41,73
Funny, fast and furious! Ian's 
CrEvo Rants cover a


391
0:23:41,73 --> 0:23:43,489
multitude of topics in an easy 
to understand,


392
0:23:43,489 --> 0:23:45,877
comical way. Complicated subject
that normally make


393
0:23:45,877 --> 0:23:48,102
your brain hurt, hurt a lot less
when


394
0:23:48,102 --> 0:23:49,597
Ian explains them...

0:23:49,597 --> 0:23:51,285
while wearing his 
anti-government mind reading

0:23:51,285 --> 0:23:53,797
equipment. Have questions about 
Carbon 14 dating?


397
0:23:53,797 --> 0:23:56,277
Natural selection, 
thermodynamics, or... 


398
0:23:56,277 --> 0:23:58,669

[scary, dramatic music]


404
0:24:14,385 --> 0:24:17,203
Wahoo! Mail for me?


405
0:24:17,203 --> 0:24:19,449
[sound of a geiger counter 
detecting a

0:24:19,449 --> 0:24:25,681

407
0:24:25,681 --> 0:24:28,257
Hmmm...I wonder what it tastes 
like?

0:24:28,257 --> 0:24:30,933

In response to last week's 
discussion about the

population problem, YouTuber 
Kiwifrogg wrote in:


412
0:25:8,855 --> 0:25:11,256
Thanks for writing in! Several 
people brought up


413
0:25:11,256 --> 0:25:13,503
similar points, but you need to 
remember several


414
0:25:13,503 --> 0:25:17,23
things: First of all, cremation 
is a modern


415
0:25:17,23 --> 0:25:20,559
phenomena. Secondly, as I 
mentioned briefly,


416
0:25:20,559 --> 0:25:23,443
Neanderthal graves have been 
found, complete with


417
0:25:23,443 --> 0:25:26,603
burial artifacts - so it's not a
western ideal to


418
0:25:26,603 --> 0:25:29,987
bury a single plot with grave 
artifacts. Lastly,


419
0:25:29,987 --> 0:25:33,587
you also need to remember the 
astronomical numbers


420
0:25:33,587 --> 0:25:35,867
of bodies we're talking about 
here - I was


421
0:25:35,867 --> 0:25:38,643
exceedingly conservative for the
sake of argument,


422
0:25:38,643 --> 0:25:41,707
and as several viewers pointed 
out, I still only


423
0:25:41,707 --> 0:25:45,11
dealt with 200,000 years of 
people, not the two


424
0:25:45,11 --> 0:25:48,463
MILLION years of alleged human 
ancestors right


425
0:25:48,463 --> 0:25:51,575
through to Homo Habilis and the 
like. Besides


426
0:25:51,575 --> 0:25:55,343
which, none of that was my main 
point: to assume


427
0:25:55,343 --> 0:25:58,831
deep time and explain away the 
missing bodies is


428
0:25:58,831 --> 0:26:2,279
arguing from absence of 
evidence.

Actually, I got it from a 
Messianic Rabbi on


431
0:26:16,81 --> 0:26:19,37
YouTube by the name of Steven 
DeNoon. He pointed it


432
0:26:19,37 --> 0:26:21,581
out in scripture and I went and 
looked - and he's


433
0:26:21,581 --> 0:26:24,869
right! The word "bush" that is 
used there in Exodus


434
0:26:24,869 --> 0:26:27,413
is the word Sen-eh which 
according to


435
0:26:27,413 --> 0:26:29,197
Strong's concordance is


436
0:26:29,197 --> 0:26:31,261
a bush, thorny bush


437
0:26:31,261 --> 0:26:32,933
the burning bush of Moses


438
0:26:32,933 --> 0:26:35,189
perhaps a blackberry bush


439
0:26:35,189 --> 0:26:38,221
And of course we see the 
representation of the Holy


440
0:26:38,221 --> 0:26:41,193
Spirit there as well in the form
of fire, and we


441
0:26:41,193 --> 0:26:45,321
are told that this was all 
"God." So you can see


442
0:26:45,321 --> 0:26:48,513
the three parts represented in 
one,


443
0:26:48,513 --> 0:26:57,712
in that passage.

warning and comfort from our 
Creator, the Lord


457
0:27:32,86 --> 0:27:35,94

way, the truth,

and the life - no man comes to 
the Father but


459
