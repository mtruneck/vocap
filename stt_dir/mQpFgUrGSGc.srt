1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:6,608



2
0:0:6,608 --> 0:0:9,45
JAMES FREY: This is my attorney
in Los Angeles.


3
0:0:9,45 --> 0:0:11,45
His name's David Krintzman.


4
0:0:11,45 --> 0:0:12,85
Hey, dude, what's up?


5
0:0:12,85 --> 0:0:14,47
DAVID KRINTZMAN: Hey,
how are you?


6
0:0:14,47 --> 0:0:18,8
JAMES FREY: Dude, I have 10
process servers standing


7
0:0:18,8 --> 0:0:21,31
outside of my apartment building
saying they're suing


8
0:0:21,31 --> 0:0:27,64
me for intellectual property
theft and defamation to God


9
0:0:27,64 --> 0:0:30,7
and slander to Jesus.


10
0:0:30,7 --> 0:0:32,16
Should I call the cops?


11
0:0:32,16 --> 0:0:33,81
Should I call the
Hell's Angels?


12
0:0:33,81 --> 0:0:34,515
What should I do?


13
0:0:34,515 --> 0:0:35,91
DAVID KRINTZMAN: Hang
on just one second.


14
0:0:35,91 --> 0:0:37,64
JAMES FREY: Can they even
sue me for that?


15
0:0:37,64 --> 0:0:40,5
Can you be sued for
slandering God?


16
0:0:40,5 --> 0:0:41,3
DAVID KRINTZMAN: No--


17
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:42,5
God is not a person.


18
0:0:42,5 --> 0:0:45,685
If somebody could try to file a
lawsuit, it would get tossed


19
0:0:45,685 --> 0:0:46,42
out immediately.


20
0:0:46,42 --> 0:0:50,4
JAMES FREY: Hey, dude,
you know what?


21
0:0:50,4 --> 0:0:51,355
I'm just fucking
with you guys.


22
0:0:51,355 --> 0:0:53,6
I'm with "Vice" magazine
and they had heard


23
0:0:53,6 --> 0:0:54,52
I make crank calls.


24
0:0:54,52 --> 0:0:55,93
So we decided to crank you.


25
0:0:55,93 --> 0:0:57,4
DAVID KRINTZMAN: [LAUGHING]


26
0:0:57,4 --> 0:0:58,38
JAMES FREY: [CHUCKLING]


27
0:0:58,38 --> 0:0:59,85
DAVID KRINTZMAN: Motherfucker.


28
0:0:59,85 --> 0:1:0,34
JAMES FREY: [CHUCKLING]


29
0:1:0,34 --> 0:1:2,545
DAVID KRINTZMAN: See, this is
what I have to fucking deal


30
0:1:2,545 --> 0:1:4,26
with when I represent
James Frey.


31
0:1:4,26 --> 0:1:6,23
ROCCO CASTORO: [LAUGHING]


32
0:1:6,23 --> 0:1:7,57
JAMES FREY: Later, dude.


33
0:1:7,57 --> 0:1:9,42
I'll call you later.


34
0:1:9,42 --> 0:1:10,14
DAVID KRINTZMAN: Bye.


35
0:1:10,14 --> 0:1:11,696
JAMES FREY: Bye.


36
0:1:11,696 --> 0:1:12,61
ROCCO CASTORO: So, hi, James.


37
0:1:12,61 --> 0:1:15,24
How are you?


38
0:1:15,24 --> 0:1:15,87
JAMES FREY: I'm good.


39
0:1:15,87 --> 0:1:16,49
How are you?


40
0:1:16,49 --> 0:1:17,49
ROCCO CASTORO: You're
doing good today?


41
0:1:17,49 --> 0:1:19,8
JAMES FREY: I'm doing
well today, man.


42
0:1:19,8 --> 0:1:20,66
ROCCO CASTORO: So, there's been
a lot of press about your


43
0:1:20,66 --> 0:1:22,53
book over the last few days.


44
0:1:22,53 --> 0:1:26,99
And it's about a modern day
Messiah who advocates orgies


45
0:1:26,99 --> 0:1:30,9
and drugs and lives for a short
time in the subways


46
0:1:30,9 --> 0:1:31,32
underneath New York City.


47
0:1:31,32 --> 0:1:35,71
Now, do you think people are
going to try to kill you or


48
0:1:35,71 --> 0:1:37,42
anything like that because
of this book?


49
0:1:37,42 --> 0:1:38,5
JAMES FREY: Are people going
to try to kill me?


50
0:1:38,5 --> 0:1:39,52
I hope not, man.


51
0:1:39,52 --> 0:1:43,15
I don't want to die, you know.


52
0:1:43,15 --> 0:1:44,59
I don't know what's
going to happen.


53
0:1:44,59 --> 0:1:47,78
I mean, some people read the
book and don't find it


54
0:1:47,78 --> 0:1:48,62
offensive at all.


55
0:1:48,62 --> 0:1:52,27
And some people read it
and say, how long


56
0:1:52,27 --> 0:1:55,19
till you leave America?


57
0:1:55,19 --> 0:1:59,26
I mean, that's part of the fun
of releasing a book is seeing


58
0:1:59,26 --> 0:2:2,7
what happens, see if people read
it, see if people care,


59
0:2:2,7 --> 0:2:5,68
see how they react.


60
0:2:5,68 --> 0:2:8,35
The book wasn't designed to want
to make people kill me.


61
0:2:8,35 --> 0:2:15,15
I tried to write a valid
religious document, write a


62
0:2:15,15 --> 0:2:17,99
book about what I really think
it might be like if the


63
0:2:17,99 --> 0:2:19,99
Messiah came back to Earth.


64
0:2:19,99 --> 0:2:25,5
People think about the real
Christ and about the Bible.


65
0:2:25,5 --> 0:2:27,63
And one of the things that's
forgotten, which is one of the


66
0:2:27,63 --> 0:2:30,39
most important things, is that
when Christ was on Earth, he


67
0:2:30,39 --> 0:2:31,58
was a radical.


68
0:2:31,58 --> 0:2:34,72
He wasn't part of acceptable
society.


69
0:2:34,72 --> 0:2:37,2
He didn't believe in anything
that acceptable


70
0:2:37,2 --> 0:2:39,14
society held dear.


71
0:2:39,14 --> 0:2:44,2
He was a radical preacher with
a radical message who was


72
0:2:44,2 --> 0:2:49,4
dangerous enough so that he
was killed, so that he was


73
0:2:49,4 --> 0:2:51,13
strung up on a cross
and killed.


74
0:2:51,13 --> 0:2:54,99
I think if the Messiah were to
arrive or Christ to return, he


75
0:2:54,99 --> 0:2:58,3
would be that same
type of radical.


76
0:2:58,3 --> 0:2:59,83
ROCCO CASTORO: You said
it's your stab


77
0:2:59,83 --> 0:3:1,5
at a religious document.


78
0:3:1,5 --> 0:3:4,88
So what kind of research
went into it?


79
0:3:4,88 --> 0:3:6,61
JAMES FREY: I had a number of
consultants on the book.


80
0:3:6,61 --> 0:3:9,58
I had an orthodox rabbi here
in New York who was a


81
0:3:9,58 --> 0:3:10,19
consultant.


82
0:3:10,19 --> 0:3:13,8
I had a Pentecostal preacher,
a Catholic priest, a trauma


83
0:3:13,8 --> 0:3:17,13
surgeon, a criminal defense
attorney, a


84
0:3:17,13 --> 0:3:19,29
mental health advocate.


85
0:3:19,29 --> 0:3:21,21
I wanted the book to be right.


86
0:3:21,21 --> 0:3:25,17
I know how I feel about God and
how I feel about faith and


87
0:3:25,17 --> 0:3:26,92
how I feel about religion.


88
0:3:26,92 --> 0:3:29,33
But I didn't know the
mechanics of it.


89
0:3:29,33 --> 0:3:31,43
There are very specific theories
about Messiah.


90
0:3:31,43 --> 0:3:34,91
There are very specific
requirements within Judaism to


91
0:3:34,91 --> 0:3:36,39
be considered Messiah.


92
0:3:36,39 --> 0:3:37,885
And I needed to know
all that stuff.


93
0:3:37,885 --> 0:3:41,73
ROCCO CASTORO: The book is
structured just like the New


94
0:3:41,73 --> 0:3:42,48
Testament, Old Testament.


95
0:3:42,48 --> 0:3:44,92
It's told through different
books, through different


96
0:3:44,92 --> 0:3:48,48
narrators who interact with Ben
Zion, who's the Messiah.


97
0:3:48,48 --> 0:3:50,2
And some of the books
are actually named--


98
0:3:50,2 --> 0:3:51,37
Ruth or Esther.


99
0:3:51,37 --> 0:3:54,865
How much do they have in common
with the original?


100
0:3:54,865 --> 0:3:58,1
JAMES FREY: Obviously, I looked
a lot at the first two


101
0:3:58,1 --> 0:3:59,26
books of the Bible.


102
0:3:59,26 --> 0:4:1,6



103
0:4:1,6 --> 0:4:4,69
I looked at how the
stories were told.


104
0:4:4,69 --> 0:4:6,88
I looked at weird stuff
like numbers.


105
0:4:6,88 --> 0:4:8,64
There's a lot of numbers
in the Bible.


106
0:4:8,64 --> 0:4:10,33
And they're very specific.


107
0:4:10,33 --> 0:4:12,86
I looked at the Gospels
of Christ.


108
0:4:12,86 --> 0:4:16,93
I love that we don't know the
story of Christ from his own


109
0:4:16,93 --> 0:4:17,97
perspective.


110
0:4:17,97 --> 0:4:20,39
We just know it from people
who knew him.


111
0:4:20,39 --> 0:4:24,48
And I love that the Gospels
of Christ are, in and of


112
0:4:24,48 --> 0:4:26,17
themselves, unreliable.


113
0:4:26,17 --> 0:4:27,85
They don't actually match
up perfectly.


114
0:4:27,85 --> 0:4:29,41
They tell different stories.


115
0:4:29,41 --> 0:4:32,64
I just tried to think what would
a contemporary version


116
0:4:32,64 --> 0:4:33,84
of this be?


117
0:4:33,84 --> 0:4:36,76
So yeah, the book is written
entirely from the perspective


118
0:4:36,76 --> 0:4:42,64
of the friends, family, and
followers of Ben Zion Avrohom,


119
0:4:42,64 --> 0:4:46,53
also known as the Messiah, also
known as the Lord God.


120
0:4:46,53 --> 0:4:49,18
Every chapter of the book is
written in a radically


121
0:4:49,18 --> 0:4:50,11
different voice.


122
0:4:50,11 --> 0:4:54,22
The first chapter is a
18-year-old Puerto Rican girl


123
0:4:54,22 --> 0:4:56,41
living in a housing project
in the Bronx.


124
0:4:56,41 --> 0:5:0,55
The second chapter is
45-year-old foreman at a


125
0:5:0,55 --> 0:5:1,73
construction site.


126
0:5:1,73 --> 0:5:5,82
The third chapter is a
38-year-old trauma surgeon at


127
0:5:5,82 --> 0:5:6,85
a hospital.


128
0:5:6,85 --> 0:5:11,49
And it was cool to have to
literally reinvent how I wrote


129
0:5:11,49 --> 0:5:12,33
with every chapter.


130
0:5:12,33 --> 0:5:14,45
ROCCO CASTORO: When you were
compiling research for the


131
0:5:14,45 --> 0:5:17,35
book, did you have any new
thoughts about faith?


132
0:5:17,35 --> 0:5:19,84
JAMES FREY: Oh, I have a
profound respect for faith.


133
0:5:19,84 --> 0:5:22,78
I mean, if anything, writing the
book gave me more respect


134
0:5:22,78 --> 0:5:25,39
for religion and made me
think about it more.


135
0:5:25,39 --> 0:5:28,68
But what the book really is is
me trying to work out my own


136
0:5:28,68 --> 0:5:30,27
feelings about it.


137
0:5:30,27 --> 0:5:34,22
I've struggled with the idea of
God and religion and faith


138
0:5:34,22 --> 0:5:35,47
almost my whole life.


139
0:5:35,47 --> 0:5:38,67
And it's something I've written
about every time I've


140
0:5:38,67 --> 0:5:39,57
written a book.


141
0:5:39,57 --> 0:5:43,52
You know, most of "A Million
Little Pieces" is about it.


142
0:5:43,52 --> 0:5:44,69
I walk around New York.


143
0:5:44,69 --> 0:5:48,9
And I see things that are
incredibly beautiful every day


144
0:5:48,9 --> 0:5:50,23
and incredibly horrific
every day.


145
0:5:50,23 --> 0:5:53,14
And you think about, well,
why are we even here?


146
0:5:53,14 --> 0:5:55,11
How does my brain work?


147
0:5:55,11 --> 0:5:58,25
Is my brain different from
my spirit or my soul?


148
0:5:58,25 --> 0:6:1,6
Do I believe, do I not?


149
0:6:1,6 --> 0:6:2,73
What do I believe in?


150
0:6:2,73 --> 0:6:7,2
How do I reconcile living in the
21st century, living in an


151
0:6:7,2 --> 0:6:11,79
era of nuclear weapons and
genetic engineering and living


152
0:6:11,79 --> 0:6:17,44
in an era where we know being
gay is not a decision somebody


153
0:6:17,44 --> 0:6:20,81
makes but the way
someone's born?


154
0:6:20,81 --> 0:6:23,42
How do we reconcile
these ideas--


155
0:6:23,42 --> 0:6:29,22
the physics of Stephen Hawking
with, you know, stories of a


156
0:6:29,22 --> 0:6:32,37
man with a big white beard who
sits on a chair with a bunch


157
0:6:32,37 --> 0:6:34,19
of dudes judging everybody?


158
0:6:34,19 --> 0:6:36,88
It's really hard for me to
reconcile those ideas.


159
0:6:36,88 --> 0:6:39,25
But I think it must be a
beautiful thing to believe in


160
0:6:39,25 --> 0:6:43,32
God without a shred of doubt
and to have faith.


161
0:6:43,32 --> 0:6:44,56
ROCCO CASTORO: Were
you brought up


162
0:6:44,56 --> 0:6:45,8
with any sort of religion?


163
0:6:45,8 --> 0:6:47,28
JAMES FREY: I was baptized
Catholic.


164
0:6:47,28 --> 0:6:49,38
And I was confirmed Episcopal.


165
0:6:49,38 --> 0:6:51,64
And my parents took us to
church every Sunday


166
0:6:51,64 --> 0:6:52,81
when I was a kid.


167
0:6:52,81 --> 0:6:54,44
I grew up in Cleveland.


168
0:6:54,44 --> 0:6:59,1
But I've never been able
to really believe in


169
0:6:59,1 --> 0:7:1,0
that kind of God.


170
0:7:1,0 --> 0:7:4,81
And in a lot of ways, the book
is me writing about a God I


171
0:7:4,81 --> 0:7:6,59
could believe in.


172
0:7:6,59 --> 0:7:9,15
If I were to believe in
something, it would be


173
0:7:9,15 --> 0:7:10,24
someone like this.


174
0:7:10,24 --> 0:7:12,26
ROCCO CASTORO: I've had a lot
of the same struggles.


175
0:7:12,26 --> 0:7:15,22
At the same time, when I find
myself in really crappy


176
0:7:15,22 --> 0:7:18,48
situations, I might
do something that


177
0:7:18,48 --> 0:7:19,93
could be called praying.


178
0:7:19,93 --> 0:7:24,21
Have you done that any time
recently or in the last 10


179
0:7:24,21 --> 0:7:25,42
years or anything like that?


180
0:7:25,42 --> 0:7:28,69
JAMES FREY: Yeah, many times.


181
0:7:28,69 --> 0:7:31,52
I mean, whenever you go through
a bad time in your


182
0:7:31,52 --> 0:7:33,64
life, you want some
reassurance, or


183
0:7:33,64 --> 0:7:34,72
you want some help.


184
0:7:34,72 --> 0:7:37,52
And when your life's completely
out of control, you


185
0:7:37,52 --> 0:7:40,795
want to try to find some way
to control it or find some


186
0:7:40,795 --> 0:7:42,8
thing that can control it.


187
0:7:42,8 --> 0:7:44,84



188
0:7:44,84 --> 0:7:46,78
I don't really talk
about this.


189
0:7:46,78 --> 0:7:48,12
I've never really
talked about it.


190
0:7:48,12 --> 0:7:52,89
But my wife and I had a son who
died a couple years ago.


191
0:7:52,89 --> 0:7:53,73
I sat in the hospital.


192
0:7:53,73 --> 0:7:56,69
And I watched him die.


193
0:7:56,69 --> 0:8:1,76
And when that was happening, I
would get on my knees every


194
0:8:1,76 --> 0:8:6,78
day and beg God for help,
literally beg and plead and


195
0:8:6,78 --> 0:8:9,18
cry and say, help me.


196
0:8:9,18 --> 0:8:12,61
I would say, take me and
let my son have a life.


197
0:8:12,61 --> 0:8:13,9
I don't need a life.


198
0:8:13,9 --> 0:8:15,94
Take my life, give it to him.


199
0:8:15,94 --> 0:8:20,69
And while that was happening,
I went to churches of


200
0:8:20,69 --> 0:8:22,81
different denominations
around New York.


201
0:8:22,81 --> 0:8:23,76
I went to a mosque.


202
0:8:23,76 --> 0:8:24,895
I went to a synagogue.


203
0:8:24,895 --> 0:8:26,58
I went to all these places.


204
0:8:26,58 --> 0:8:28,92
And everywhere I went, I
got down on my knees.


205
0:8:28,92 --> 0:8:30,92
And I begged for help.


206
0:8:30,92 --> 0:8:32,28
I begged for something--


207
0:8:32,28 --> 0:8:36,87
for relief, for a sign,
for whatever.


208
0:8:36,87 --> 0:8:38,27
And I didn't get anything.


209
0:8:38,27 --> 0:8:39,65
I didn't feel anything.


210
0:8:39,65 --> 0:8:43,929
I don't know if that's because
I'm a bad guy in God's eyes.


211
0:8:43,929 --> 0:8:46,98
I don't know if that's because
there isn't a God.


212
0:8:46,98 --> 0:8:51,24
I don't know if I did it the
wrong way or if I needed to do


213
0:8:51,24 --> 0:8:53,76
it before that to be able
to get the help then.


214
0:8:53,76 --> 0:8:54,43
I don't know.


215
0:8:54,43 --> 0:8:56,9
I don't have the answers
to any of it.


216
0:8:56,9 --> 0:9:0,16
But I've never gotten a sign.


217
0:9:0,16 --> 0:9:3,88
ROCCO CASTORO: A large part of
the book has to do with the


218
0:9:3,88 --> 0:9:6,28
world is ending in some way.


219
0:9:6,28 --> 0:9:9,62
And whether that means flat-out
apocalypse, and


220
0:9:9,62 --> 0:9:14,9
everything blows up, or just a
complete change of how humans


221
0:9:14,9 --> 0:9:17,61
live, that's what Ben Zion
preaches in the book.


222
0:9:17,61 --> 0:9:20,39
And that's the word of
God through him.


223
0:9:20,39 --> 0:9:24,85
Do you think we could be close
to the end-- like, this could


224
0:9:24,85 --> 0:9:26,986
really be happening right now?


225
0:9:26,986 --> 0:9:29,76
JAMES FREY: I mean, I think we
live in a world where a lot of


226
0:9:29,76 --> 0:9:31,38
people have a lot of bombs.


227
0:9:31,38 --> 0:9:36,22
There are bombs that take
out tens of millions


228
0:9:36,22 --> 0:9:38,1
of people at a time.


229
0:9:38,1 --> 0:9:40,81
And there's a lot of hatred
between all the people who


230
0:9:40,81 --> 0:9:41,98
have these weapons.


231
0:9:41,98 --> 0:9:43,93
And if you look at the conflicts
around the world,


232
0:9:43,93 --> 0:9:47,32
most of them are religious
conflicts--


233
0:9:47,32 --> 0:9:51,85
the Middle East, Israel,
Palestine, the United States.


234
0:9:51,85 --> 0:9:55,26
And Islam as a global religion
is, in large


235
0:9:55,26 --> 0:9:57,1
part, a religious conflict.


236
0:9:57,1 --> 0:10:0,49
9/11 was a strike in the
name of religion.


237
0:10:0,49 --> 0:10:5,0
And if you look back over the
course of history for the last


238
0:10:5,0 --> 0:10:8,93
couple thousand years, most of
the big wars have sort of been


239
0:10:8,93 --> 0:10:11,11
land grabs done in the
name of religion.


240
0:10:11,11 --> 0:10:13,83



241
0:10:13,83 --> 0:10:17,66
And unless there's some other
system that comes in to


242
0:10:17,66 --> 0:10:19,21
replace the ones we have--


243
0:10:19,21 --> 0:10:22,17
which I don't see happening--


244
0:10:22,17 --> 0:10:23,4
nothing's going to change.


245
0:10:23,4 --> 0:10:31,56
There'll be some sort of major
conflict tied into religion


246
0:10:31,56 --> 0:10:34,846
that will kill a
lot of people.


247
0:10:34,846 --> 0:10:37,63
ROCCO CASTORO: And let's talk
about something else that's a


248
0:10:37,63 --> 0:10:40,33
big deal with this book--


249
0:10:40,33 --> 0:10:41,48
how you're publishing it.


250
0:10:41,48 --> 0:10:44,43
So why don't you tell us exactly
what your plans are


251
0:10:44,43 --> 0:10:45,985
for releasing this
to the world.


252
0:10:45,985 --> 0:10:48,7
JAMES FREY: I tried to write a
radical book that wasn't like


253
0:10:48,7 --> 0:10:50,51
anything anybody had
done before.


254
0:10:50,51 --> 0:10:54,7
And I'm trying to release
it in a radical way.


255
0:10:54,7 --> 0:10:56,64
I've had problems in my career
before when I write


256
0:10:56,64 --> 0:10:59,18
controversial material, problems
dealing with sort of


257
0:10:59,18 --> 0:11:4,4
corporate entities behind it
and how they disavow it or


258
0:11:4,4 --> 0:11:7,18
step away from it once
the controversy


259
0:11:7,18 --> 0:11:8,49
reaches a certain point.


260
0:11:8,49 --> 0:11:9,95
So I decided I wasn't
even going to


261
0:11:9,95 --> 0:11:12,1
contemplate doing that.


262
0:11:12,1 --> 0:11:16,8
So I thought an art gallery
would be a more appropriate


263
0:11:16,8 --> 0:11:17,61
place to publish books.


264
0:11:17,61 --> 0:11:20,21
I got in touch with five
of my artist friends--


265
0:11:20,21 --> 0:11:23,99
Richard Prince, Ed Ruscha, Terry
Richardson, Dan Colen,


266
0:11:23,99 --> 0:11:25,265
and Richard Phillips.


267
0:11:25,265 --> 0:11:27,74
And I'm collaborating with
them on making these


268
0:11:27,74 --> 0:11:31,66
illuminated manuscripts, like
old medieval Bibles, where


269
0:11:31,66 --> 0:11:35,57
they sort of make art that
is their reaction to


270
0:11:35,57 --> 0:11:37,6
what they've read.


271
0:11:37,6 --> 0:11:39,21
And then we publish it as
sort of a book with a


272
0:11:39,21 --> 0:11:40,35
lot of art in it.


273
0:11:40,35 --> 0:11:43,23
And they're going to be
beautiful, astounding,


274
0:11:43,23 --> 0:11:45,48
one-of-a-kind objects.


275
0:11:45,48 --> 0:11:50,1
And I think the future of
publishing is that.


276
0:11:50,1 --> 0:11:55,26
We're seeing publishing change
very radically right now.


277
0:11:55,26 --> 0:11:56,58
We have the internet.


278
0:11:56,58 --> 0:11:59,46
We have digital devices like
the Kindle and the


279
0:11:59,46 --> 0:12:2,8
Nook and the iPad.


280
0:12:2,8 --> 0:12:4,1
And I don't need a publisher
to release my


281
0:12:4,1 --> 0:12:5,76
books on those things.


282
0:12:5,76 --> 0:12:7,93
So I sort of arrived that I
was going to publish these


283
0:12:7,93 --> 0:12:11,54
beautiful books and limit the
number of them and then, at


284
0:12:11,54 --> 0:12:15,4
the same time, let anybody who
wants to read the book read it


285
0:12:15,4 --> 0:12:16,54
on a digital device.


286
0:12:16,54 --> 0:12:19,95
I wanted to become a writer to
break rules and to get in


287
0:12:19,95 --> 0:12:27,53
trouble and to do things
that pushed boundaries.


288
0:12:27,53 --> 0:12:29,88
And I think at some point,
literature has become this


289
0:12:29,88 --> 0:12:32,78
precious thing that doesn't
value that anymore, even


290
0:12:32,78 --> 0:12:40,2
though most of the historical
figures in it only did that.


291
0:12:40,2 --> 0:12:42,38
Something's a book.


292
0:12:42,38 --> 0:12:45,66
And everything else
is irrelevant.


293
0:12:45,66 --> 0:12:48,7
What's relevant is when somebody
picks up that book


294
0:12:48,7 --> 0:12:52,27
and reads it, how it makes them
feel or if it makes them


295
0:12:52,27 --> 0:12:56,1
think or, if at the end
of it, they think it


296
0:12:56,1 --> 0:12:57,71
was worth their time.


297
0:12:57,71 --> 0:12:59,66
All the other stuff
is just bullshit.


298
0:12:59,66 --> 0:14:59,66
