1
0:0:0,99 --> 0:0:4,83
what's not known uh... or not this
customer is


2
0:0:4,83 --> 0:0:7,89
the massive


3
0:0:7,89 --> 0:0:11,999
contamination and and environmental
disaster that happened in iraq


4
0:0:11,999 --> 0:0:13,369
and as a result


5
0:0:13,369 --> 0:0:14,53
uh... its


6
0:0:14,53 --> 0:0:16,939
it's cause massive deformities


7
0:0:16,939 --> 0:0:20,569
in children warning iraq right now so


8
0:0:20,569 --> 0:0:25,299
so deputy speaker livid about that ally
depleted uranium essentially is what it


9
0:0:25,299 --> 0:0:29,89
is is depleted uranium season weaponry
are primarily uh... because it


10
0:0:29,89 --> 0:0:31,439
candy penetrate armor


11
0:0:31,439 --> 0:0:32,92
and it was used


12
0:0:32,92 --> 0:0:36,85
a lot by the u_s_ troops said the u_n_
you can't take trips you some of it as


13
0:0:36,85 --> 0:0:38,93
well but um... though u_s_ troops


14
0:0:38,93 --> 0:0:42,18
he's quite a bit of a time in a more
tell the u_n_


15
0:0:42,18 --> 0:0:45,43
and that anywhere where they use these
area so that they can be decontaminated


16
0:0:45,43 --> 0:0:49,64
dot right now the uh... that the
incidents of birth defects and


17
0:0:49,64 --> 0:0:50,92
deformities


18
0:0:50,92 --> 0:0:56,16
and communities doubt word targeted by
u_s_ troops is is really astounding i


19
0:0:56,16 --> 0:0:59,53
i'm not sure what the exact number was i
think we have some graphics on that we


20
0:0:59,53 --> 0:1:1,29
do uh... so


21
0:1:1,29 --> 0:1:5,69
the birth defects influenza uh... itself
is working times higher


22
0:1:5,69 --> 0:1:10,42
uh... then in her rocha nine nagasaki
after the party fun stuff


23
0:1:10,42 --> 0:1:13,88
and we have graphics of of the pictures
of that


24
0:1:13,88 --> 0:1:17,719
kids patties extremely yes really ready
to


25
0:1:17,719 --> 0:1:21,22
yet because we missed please look away
is is that


26
0:1:21,22 --> 0:1:23,53
it's it's really interesting


27
0:1:23,53 --> 0:1:25,469
now this is not even counting the


28
0:1:25,469 --> 0:1:29,36
the many many babies who were citizens
will have to have


29
0:1:29,36 --> 0:1:32,77
and that i had the doctors there say
they have never seen this kind of the


30
0:1:32,77 --> 0:1:37,1
former before coming to this trial has
hafter habits of guest intestines and


31
0:1:37,1 --> 0:1:38,549
organs after the body


32
0:1:38,549 --> 0:1:43,31
and multiple words


33
0:1:43,31 --> 0:1:46,729
so it's really cute depressing to see
that that set that's what's going on


34
0:1:46,729 --> 0:1:50,42
also just said to to make a point of
this that the united nations


35
0:1:50,42 --> 0:1:52,6
last december in the general assembly


36
0:1:52,6 --> 0:1:56,439
attempted to pass a resolution setting
in which it is the precautionary


37
0:1:56,439 --> 0:1:59,229
principle when it comes to the use of
depleted uranium


38
0:1:59,229 --> 0:2:0,389
but the u_s_


39
0:2:0,389 --> 0:2:5,74
the u_k_ france and israel voted against
that resolution to take depleted uranium


40
0:2:5,74 --> 0:2:9,56
out of the next an again so hundred
fifty five of the country said that we


41
0:2:9,56 --> 0:2:14,6
should stop using it and uh... partially
united states is in favor of continuing


42
0:2:14,6 --> 0:2:16,76
and even though it has such an
environmental destruction to the very


43
0:2:16,76 --> 0:2:18,799
difficult to clean up and the
environment


44
0:2:18,799 --> 0:2:23,299
and it has is very clear connections to
these these parents need to know if this


45
0:2:23,299 --> 0:2:27,209
is not just the iraqis were suffering
it's our own soldiers to because um...


46
0:2:27,209 --> 0:2:30,629
there are a lot of soldiers who are also
suffering from depleted uranium


47
0:2:30,629 --> 0:2:32,79
contaminations


48
0:2:32,79 --> 0:2:35,49
what happened to them if they're getting
these massive headaches with their


49
0:2:35,49 --> 0:2:37,109
stability they can't move


50
0:2:37,109 --> 0:2:38,89
there are so urinating line


51
0:2:38,89 --> 0:2:42,229
round there at their date diagnosis
cancer


52
0:2:42,229 --> 0:2:44,48
anticancer res influences


53
0:2:44,48 --> 0:2:46,79
through the roof uh...


54
0:2:46,79 --> 0:2:49,619
back in the nineties and used to be a
after the after that rocked work in


55
0:2:49,619 --> 0:2:50,519
ninety one


56
0:2:50,519 --> 0:2:53,949
uh... there's cancer in her between
forty and then with the pit eight


57
0:2:53,949 --> 0:2:57,669
hundred uh... people per one hundred
thousand iraqis


58
0:2:57,669 --> 0:3:2,109
now that rate is above sixteen hundred
uh... iraqis


59
0:3:2,109 --> 0:3:5,549
one hundred thousand so this is why i
think a lot of young voters uh...


60
0:3:5,549 --> 0:3:9,79
sympathize with the libertarian party
and why out you know you know ron paul


61
0:3:9,79 --> 0:3:11,459
didn't stand a chance


62
0:3:11,459 --> 0:3:15,45
the fact that he doesn't want to do
these rediculous invasions and he


63
0:3:15,45 --> 0:3:16,67
doesn't want to


64
0:3:16,67 --> 0:3:20,8
by into the military industrial complex
is very appealing to people such as


65
0:3:20,8 --> 0:3:21,769
myself


66
0:3:21,769 --> 0:3:25,639
now of course i hear libertarians lose
me when it comes to certain other


67
0:3:25,639 --> 0:3:31,41
policies like fiscal policy but we need
a party that will reject the notion


68
0:3:31,41 --> 0:3:35,28
that we need to invade other countries
to spread democracy and of course that's


69
0:3:35,28 --> 0:3:38,2
always a facade that's not what we're
really doing we're going to and i know


70
0:3:38,2 --> 0:3:41,62
what you think your honor the country i
want to see what we're doing there


71
0:3:41,62 --> 0:3:42,959
we could see these pictures


72
0:3:42,959 --> 0:3:44,63
everyone's as these pictures i mean


73
0:3:44,63 --> 0:3:46,66
the mediation should show inspectors


74
0:3:46,66 --> 0:3:50,489
we did see pictures of a bar coffins of
our soldiers coming back


75
0:3:50,489 --> 0:3:55,19
we can we're not sure that that's that's
the failure of the mainstream press and


76
0:3:55,19 --> 0:3:59,33
it you know it's the duty of new media
to get involved and to expose it which


77
0:3:59,33 --> 0:4:2,249
is why we're doing this story now
however graphic it is


78
0:4:2,249 --> 0:4:5,889
uh... and and and the reason why the
mainstream media doesn't cover these


79
0:4:5,889 --> 0:4:9,339
stories is because of something that we
talk about on a regular basis on the


80
0:4:9,339 --> 0:4:14,59
shelf uh... you know they arb bought off
by corporations uh... you don't think


81
0:4:14,59 --> 0:4:20,299
about how i'd be media covered uh... the
iraq war leading up to the yatra i mean


82
0:4:20,299 --> 0:4:25,5
it was rediculous if u said anything
against invading iraq you would have


83
0:4:25,5 --> 0:4:31,139
been shot and in the mainstream press
with people were fired the dixie chicks


84
0:4:31,139 --> 0:4:34,389
albert just completely criticizing the
mainstream media michael moore was


85
0:4:34,389 --> 0:4:37,77
completely criticizing the mainstream
media phil donahue losses showing he was


86
0:4:37,77 --> 0:4:41,419
required to bring onto two adults two
conservatives for


87
0:4:41,419 --> 0:4:43,83
his one being a liberal and


88
0:4:43,83 --> 0:4:48,239
other other correspondents field yes was
bent i mean and


89
0:4:48,239 --> 0:4:51,659
they kept their other contractors from
golden were awesome parker


90
0:4:51,659 --> 0:4:56,36
yeah antiwar rhetoric so that they just
kept in a closet secures money diskeeper


91
0:4:56,36 --> 0:4:57,23
marge schott


92
0:4:57,23 --> 0:4:58,78
and to do that for a few years


93
0:4:58,78 --> 0:5:2,229
and that was by the so-called liberal
and this n_b_c_ people


94
0:5:2,229 --> 0:5:5,259
because they're owned by g_e_ which is
one of the main


95
0:5:5,259 --> 0:5:9,229
uh... defense contractors act so that we
can see how money influences influences


96
0:5:9,229 --> 0:5:10,919
are media the media is bought


97
0:5:10,919 --> 0:5:12,809
uh... an apologist for bought


98
0:5:12,809 --> 0:5:16,52
that's why we stumbled into this war
that we've never should have


99
0:5:16,52 --> 0:5:19,669
i what i want to read and i don't think
there was stumbling you know i think we


100
0:5:19,669 --> 0:5:23,409
were actually closing hours remain and
herded like cattle basically into this


101
0:5:23,409 --> 0:5:25,129
it was choreographed it was


102
0:5:25,129 --> 0:5:30,69
bought and paid for as you say you know
the in the media via the entire military


103
0:5:30,69 --> 0:5:34,169
industrial complex everybody that had
something to gain from this and even


104
0:5:34,169 --> 0:5:35,69
people who didn't


105
0:5:35,69 --> 0:5:39,689
got roped into pushing us into the
warranty as if we have learned nothing


106
0:5:39,689 --> 0:7:39,689
nothing from that
