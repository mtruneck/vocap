###1 EDDIE HUANG: Yo, let me get one real quick, son.
###3 Thank you.
###4 -How you doing out here?
###5 I just can't let you know who I am, you know what I mean?
###6 You can't see me.
###7 EDDIE HUANG: I appreciate that homie.
###9 Fly that red flag--
###10 Soo Woo, soo woo.
###13 [LAUGHS].
###14 [THEME SONG PLAYING]
###31 EDDIE HUANG: Yo what up?
###31 It's your boy Eddie Huang.
###32 We're in San Francisco's Mission District today.
###34 We're going to go visit the Rice Paper Scissors crew.
###36 These girls do a lot of guerrilla cooking, so we're
###38 going to pop up curbside, grill some octopus, eat some
###40 rice paper, see what's really good.
###42 This is "Fresh Off the Boat."
###46 EDDIE HUANG: Hi, I'm Eddie.
###46 VALERIE LUU: Hey, I'm Valerie.
###47 EDDIE HUANG: Valerie, hi.
###48 KATIE KWAN: And I'm Katie.
###48 EDDIE HUANG: Katie, great.
###49 So you all are Rice Paper Scissor.
###52 VALERIE LUU: Yeah
###52 KATIE KWAN: Rice.
###53 EDDIE HUANG: Rice paper--
###54 I got it.
###54 That's what's up.
###55 So what do you guys want to make today?
###57 KATIE KWAN: We basically are going to grill.
###58 So we just want to find stuff to grill.
###60 EDDIE HUANG: Check for the smell, y'all.
###62 No smell.
###63 All right, we're about to try and make some Asian
###65 parents proud now.
###66 Order in all Vietnamese.
###67 VALERIE LUU: All right [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE].
###70 -[SPEAKING VIETNAMESE]
###74 VALERIE LUU: Some, octopus.
###76 EDDIE HUANG: I think he just fucked you up because you had
###77 to use some English.
###78 KATIE KWAN: No!
###79 [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE]
###82 EDDIE HUANG: [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE]
###83 
###85 -[SPEAKING VIETNAMESE]
###87 
###91 EDDIE HUANG: The little cooking lesson for y'all that
###93 he's giving us is, he's saying, if you're going to
###95 grill oysters, get the bigger, fattier one because it'll
###98 stand up to being cooked.
###99 If it's smaller, it's not enough, it's too delicate--
###102 you just want to eat it raw.
###103 VALERIE LUU: Big and fat.
###104 Big and fat.
###104 EDDIE HUANG: Big and fat.
###105 
###112 EDDIE HUANG: I do.
###113 I think the think that bothers people in the Chinese
###115 community or Asian community is, we don't have a food
###117 critic or a food writer who grew up in a Chinese home or a
###121 Vietnamese home.
###122 So don't come tell me what's the best until you've really
###125 tried to immerse yourself and give credit to
###128 where it comes from.
###129 
###133 EDDIE HUANG: When it's not a food that I really grew up
###136 eating and really feel like I understand, I let people tell
###139 me about it.
###139 And then I go to explore.
###141 You have to eat your way through a cuisine and a
###143 culture before you can say something about it.
###146 That's how I feel.
###148 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###151 VALERIE LUU: Welcome to San Francisco.
###152 
###155 EDDIE HUANG: I like this town.
###156 I fucks with this town.
###158 VALERIE LUU: So we're going to Duc Loi supermarket, which is
###159 our go-to spot.
###161 It's like a Vietnamese haven in the heart of the Mission.
###163 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###168 EDDIE HUANG: This is a nice grocery room.
###169 Very multicultural, serving the neighborhood.
###171 Got some galanga for the Thai people, epazote, Mexican, baby
###176 dill for the WPs.
###178 KATIE KWAN: I think we're going to
###179 grill some rice paper.
###179 EDDIE HUANG: That's your shit, right?
###180 Grilled rice paper.
###181 VALERIE LUU: Three Ladies?
###182 KATIE KWAN: Three Ladies.
###183 I love the Three Ladies.
###184 EDDIE HUANG: Three Ladies go great with sausage.
###187 Usually bagels, hard outside, right?
###189 Watch what happens to these bagels?
###190 Doof.
###191 Do you see that?
###192 This is not a bagel.
###193 It's like a hamburger bun with the middle taken out.
###196 If the bagels were good, burritos would not be this
###199 popular in San Francisco.
###200 VALERIE LUU: Who's got the cash money?
###200 KATIE KWAN: Eddie.
###201 EDDIE HUANG: That's my-- oh.
###202 I got money.
###203 Yo, David, where that "Vice" money at?
###206 
###209 Pop-ups are everywhere, man.
###210 Like, I think pop-ups are actually played out.
###212 But what these girls are doing transcends the moniker of
###215 "pop-up." They're culturally relevant beyond the box that
###219 people want to put them in.
###220 This is a funny situation.
###221 Like, pop-up or not, man, like, what the
###224 fuck is this, man?
###225 
###229 VALERIE LUU: So the Vietnamese way to get all your friends
###232 and family to work for you-- this is what's
###234 happening right here.
###237 Food is a lot about stories.
###238 It's about where it came from, and who is eating it,
###239 and how it's made.
###240 And to get people together.
###242 And so that's what we do at our pop-ups, to get people
###244 together on the street, and look at each other, and
###246 rubbing elbows and kneecaps.
###250 [MEOWING]
###252 EDDIE HUANG: Oh, we got cats?
###253 That's the authentic Vietnamese food.
###255 [LAUGHS].
###257 KATIE KWAN: So I'm American.
###258 I was born and raised in Sunnyvale.
###260 Vietnamese food was my way to get into my culture.
###262 After college, I didn't really want a real job.
###264 I wanted to do my own thing.
###265 And again, that's that Vietnamese blood.
###266 You want to hustle and be your own boss.
###268 And then food was just a way to do that.
###271 EDDIE HUANG: Food is a great gateway drug
###273 into any foreign culture.
###274 Because you can consume it, and it's like the base level
###277 that you share with people.
###279 That is just perfect.
###280 KATIE KWAN: And it was a great way to hang out with grandma.
###282 Like grandma--
###282 I grew up eating Red Baron frozen pizzas because mom was
###286 a single mother, and that's all we had time for.
###288 And also grandma's cooking when she took care of us.
###290 As I got older, I got more into that.
###292 And so it's my way of getting to my culture.
###294 Because my parents won't understand the tech stuff I
###297 would have done in another life.
###298 Social media stuff.
###299 But we could all understand food, and geek out about it,
###302 and connect around it.
###305 EDDIE HUANG: This one looks good.
###306 -Ooh, limes.
###307 -Octopus.
###308 Put it in your mouth.
###309 -Excuse me.
###309 -Put it inside your body.
###310 -Ooh.
###310 Ai-yah.
###311 I saw that.
###314 EDDIE HUANG: This is fucking delicious.
###315 -[INAUDIBLE] soba?
###316 VALERIE LUU: Soba?
###317 EDDIE HUANG: Yo, y'all can actually cook.
###319 VALERIE LUU: Aww, yeah.
###319 -Are you surprised?
###321 EDDIE HUANG: Mm-hmm.
###321 Food, to me, can get boring when all you're talking about
###325 is the things that are on the plate, within the dimensions.
###328 But they're really embracing the culture of dining, the
###332 lifestyle of being a cook.
###334 It's just great to see, man.
###335 I eat at a lot of places.
###336 I tell a lot of horrible stories, but
###338 this is a good one.
###339 KATIE KWAN: OK, I think it's time for some rice wine.
###340 EDDIE HUANG: Rice wine.
###341 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###343 
###345 [CHEERING]
###347 EDDIE HUANG: Oh please, please, more doo-doo water.
###350 This is some horrible, horrible shit.
###353 ALL TOGETHER: [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE].
###354 
###359 -There's like floating shit in there.
###361 EDDIE HUANG: I love counting in poor Asian languages.
###365 Next up on "Fresh Off the Boat--"
###366 burritos, burritos, burritos.
###370 Then I'm off to Little Manila to hang with the Pinoys.
###372 Get a fresh cut, and get your lotus flower game up.
###375 -We fuck with lotus flowers.
###377 No, that's pussy, right?
###378 [MUSIC PLAYING]
