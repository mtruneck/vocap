1
0:0:5,8 --> 0:0:13,57
Technology is like a mirror. If an idiot looks
in, you can't expect an apostle to look out.


2
0:0:13,57 --> 0:0:17,689
It's, it's... I remember when I first saw
some Photoshop,


3
0:0:17,689 --> 0:0:23,16
the very first version of it called Pixel,
in fact a very early version,


4
0:0:23,16 --> 0:0:25,82
and I saw some things it could do, and I couldn't
wait


5
0:0:25,82 --> 0:0:32,769
to put it on to floppy disks into my computer
and I raised my fingers and I thought:


6
0:0:32,769 --> 0:0:36,89
"Oh, I don't have any artistic talent. Ha-ha-ha...
what's the point?"


7
0:0:36,89 --> 0:0:41,83
It's like if you get a great keyboard, but
you got nothing to express musically


8
0:0:41,83 --> 0:0:46,47
it doesn't matter how good midi is
and how many synthesized sampled instruments


9
0:0:46,47 --> 0:0:51,28
you have, it facilitates it.
The great thing about social networking,


10
0:0:51,28 --> 0:0:55,979
which at the time we're talking of course
is still growing in what seems an exponential


11
0:0:55,979 --> 0:1:2,18
rate
all the time upper curve of it is that everybody


12
0:1:2,18 --> 0:1:9,17
has a talent to interact with other people
short of being on autistic spectrum of course,


13
0:1:9,17 --> 0:1:15,96
which is something many people are in very
small ways or in greater ways.


14
0:1:15,96 --> 0:1:21,0
And even that could be helped by the interactions
off the internet.


15
0:1:21,0 --> 0:1:26,3
And I think, forgetting the technology, forgetting
what your device can do,


16
0:1:26,3 --> 0:1:29,27
forgetting how good the camera is or anything
like that,


17
0:1:29,27 --> 0:1:34,6
the most successful usage you can make of
for example Twitter or Facebook


18
0:1:34,6 --> 0:1:40,45
or any of those social networking services
are completely down to your personality, absolutely


19
0:1:40,45 --> 0:1:46,31
to do with who you are.
I think, particularly in America, it's common


20
0:1:46,31 --> 0:1:50,25
more across the World
there is this yearning for people to find


21
0:1:50,25 --> 0:1:54,37
answers to techniques that will make them
happy or rich.


22
0:1:54,37 --> 0:1:59,61
In fact probably the other order: rich and
then happy, because of course richness gives


23
0:1:59,61 --> 0:2:8,39
happiness, doesn't it? Hm...
Well, to me... if I had known when I was younger,


24
0:2:8,39 --> 0:2:15,62
chasing technique, chasing an answer is fatal.
And I would say this, and many people will


25
0:2:15,62 --> 0:2:19,9
scream in disbelief,
the worst thing you can ever do in your life


26
0:2:19,9 --> 0:2:26,19
is set yourself goals.
I think goal orientation is absolutely disastrous


27
0:2:26,19 --> 0:2:30,4
in life.
Two things happen: one — you don't meet


28
0:2:30,4 --> 0:2:34,55
your goals, you call yourself a failure.
Secondly — you meet your goal, you go: "Well,


29
0:2:34,55 --> 0:2:38,94
I'm here, and now what?
I'm not happy. I've got this car, this job,


30
0:2:38,94 --> 0:2:43,59
I'm living in this address, which I always
thought the place I wanted to be, and... what?"


31
0:2:43,59 --> 0:2:48,52
Because you're going for something outside
yourself, and that's no good.


32
0:2:48,52 --> 0:2:52,29
My favorite quotation almost (or at least
for the moment) is from Noel Coward


33
0:2:52,29 --> 0:2:55,17
who's very great actor, producer, writer,
musician,


34
0:2:55,17 --> 0:3:1,12
he is all around, he is known as the Master
by everyone who knew, because he is so good


35
0:3:1,12 --> 0:3:7,79
in everything
and he said: "Work is more fun than fun."


36
0:3:7,79 --> 0:3:14,4
And if I have known that real joy in life
is work, and if you


37
0:3:14,4 --> 0:3:19,84
can say of the work you do that it's more
fun than fun, then you're in the right place.


38
0:3:19,84 --> 0:3:22,98
Most of us of course don't have that all the
time,


39
0:3:22,98 --> 0:3:26,18
but every time you look in the bathroom mirror
in the morning,


40
0:3:26,18 --> 0:3:28,79
if you can say: "Is my work — more fun than
fun?


41
0:3:28,79 --> 0:3:34,349
Or is it dreddy water, is it getting me to
a wage package, which allows me to go to bars,


42
0:3:34,349 --> 0:3:40,599
and buy things." If that's it, then that's
bit of a treadmill I think.


43
0:3:40,599 --> 0:3:45,51
And everyone has in them to express themselves
that fundamental thing that they know they


44
0:3:45,51 --> 0:3:50,5
are inside
that rather beautiful afraid person, which


45
0:3:50,5 --> 0:3:55,62
might get translated into aggression or silence
or shines or all kinds of other things, but


46
0:3:55,62 --> 0:4:0,349
inside we know we are huggable, lovable, we
want to love and be loved.


47
0:4:0,349 --> 0:4:9,19
That person is yearning for fulfillment to
be the person they know they can be.


48
0:4:9,19 --> 0:4:14,53
And that's a constant journey, a process.
It's not about acquiring this thing, and then


49
0:4:14,53 --> 0:4:18,829
that thing, getting to this place, learning
this technique,


50
0:4:18,829 --> 0:4:24,39
finding out how this works. It's about, I
suppose to me


51
0:4:24,39 --> 0:4:28,189
it's about the fact that other people are
always more interesting than oneself.


52
0:4:28,189 --> 0:4:32,77
And if there is a thing... Let's forget what
successful people have in common,


53
0:4:32,77 --> 0:4:36,43
but if there is a thing what unsuccessful
people have in common - it's:


54
0:4:36,43 --> 0:4:42,33
they talk about themselves all the time.
"I need to do this. I need..." — the first


55
0:4:42,33 --> 0:4:46,77
two words are usually "I need",
and that's why nobody likes them, and that's


56
0:4:46,77 --> 0:4:51,419
why they'll never get where they want to be.
Because it's "I need, I, me, I, my..." —


57
0:4:51,419 --> 0:4:58,15
there is an English word for that: egocentric
or egoistical or egotistical.


58
0:4:58,15 --> 0:5:1,509
That all of it from "ego" that I think of
an "I"...


59
0:5:1,509 --> 0:5:5,8
and if you just say "I" all the time, you'll
get nowhere.


60
0:5:5,8 --> 0:5:8,249
If you interested in other people, if you
use your eyes to look out, not to be looked


61
0:5:8,249 --> 0:5:12,58
into,
and then you connect, then you're interesting,


62
0:5:12,58 --> 0:5:17,449
then people want to be around you,
and it's about the warmth and the charm you


63
0:5:17,449 --> 0:5:20,15
can radiate
that is real because of your positive interest


64
0:5:20,15 --> 0:5:25,729
in others
and if you expected to come to you "I've never


65
0:5:25,729 --> 0:5:29,2
had this" or "I was..." you know, you hate
people...


66
0:5:29,2 --> 0:5:32,749
You know I happened to love... I know a lot
of people don't.


67
0:5:32,749 --> 0:5:37,21
But I happened to love the works of William
Shakespeare, the poet and playwriter,


68
0:5:37,21 --> 0:5:40,809
I think they are amongst the greatest things
humanity has ever done.


69
0:5:40,809 --> 0:5:44,349
Up there, with the Pyramids, or whatever it
is you want to choose.


70
0:5:44,349 --> 0:5:48,96
You know the number of times you hear people
say "Oh, it was ruined for me at school"


71
0:5:48,96 --> 0:5:55,68
and I, I tend to say to them "Yeah, I don't
really like the Grand Canyon, or the Lake


72
0:5:55,68 --> 0:5:59,59
District, or the Mountains Of Scotland
because I’ve had really bad Geography teacher


73
0:5:59,59 --> 0:6:2,399
so I don't find either of it very beautiful"
I mean just non-sensical.


74
0:6:2,399 --> 0:6:8,889
You just.. It's a sign of people stopping
back and blaming something else rather than


75
0:6:8,889 --> 0:6:11,919
just saying
"Oh, I wasn't ready for that, maybe I never


76
0:6:11,919 --> 0:6:15,89
will be,
but I'm not gonna blame someone else for it".


77
0:6:15,89 --> 0:6:20,599
It's.. It's attitude of looking in wounds
and American television is filled with people


78
0:6:20,599 --> 0:6:23,46
sitting in chairs on it's sort of afternoon
talk-shows


79
0:6:23,46 --> 0:6:27,199
going "I need"-whining, whining about their
lives.


80
0:6:27,199 --> 0:6:30,869
"I'm beautiful, I'm lovely and yet nobody...
You know, I'm special, I have needs..."


81
0:6:30,869 --> 0:6:35,949
Oh! Shut up, stop whining.
Just grow up and get a life,


82
0:6:35,949 --> 0:6:40,169
and look around you to other people,
and don't expect other people to care,


83
0:6:40,169 --> 0:6:45,52
don't expect people to be interested.
Who, who'd you feel more sorryful, who'd you


84
0:6:45,52 --> 0:6:49,559
actually want to hug?
The person you happen to know


85
0:6:49,559 --> 0:6:54,24
has a tumor and he just getting through life
not talking about it, smiling, trying not


86
0:6:54,24 --> 0:6:58,59
to embarrass anybody about it,
or that kind of person "I have a leg that


87
0:6:58,59 --> 0:7:0,759
hurt, that one..
and I have this pain here, and doctors don't


88
0:7:0,759 --> 0:7:3,689
know what to do about it, and I get these
flashes.."


89
0:7:3,689 --> 0:7:7,289
Oh, Christ, I'm sure it's terrible for you,
dear, but shut up!


90
0:7:7,289 --> 0:7:11,909
You just don't... No, of course, we do our
best to feel sorry for all kinds of people


91
0:7:11,909 --> 0:7:18,539
or we show sympathy, but the real heroism
of people who quietly get on with their lives


92
0:7:18,539 --> 0:7:22,249
and think of others should be ruled and usually
is


93
0:7:22,249 --> 0:7:26,169
by the fact they are liked and if you like
people want to be with you, people want to


94
0:7:26,169 --> 0:7:28,659
be with you,
they show opportunities with you, and you


95
0:7:28,659 --> 0:7:33,199
observe the way they do things and your life
can open up,


96
0:7:33,199 --> 0:7:35,699
and there are opportunities everywhere, whether
it is a small town


97
0:7:35,699 --> 0:7:39,919
or a tiny apartment in the huge city - there
are opportunities.


98
0:7:39,919 --> 0:7:45,749
You know, you can simply by talking more to
the person in a coffee shop,


99
0:7:45,749 --> 0:7:51,999
in a coffee store, in your Starbucks or whatever,
simply by just having a few extra words...


100
0:7:51,999 --> 0:7:57,11
they are probably doing a concert somewhere,
in a little bar in the evening


101
0:7:57,11 --> 0:8:0,679
and you might go along and you meet there,
and they need someone else and you might,


102
0:8:0,679 --> 0:8:2,659
you might…
who knows... that's how some people become


103
0:8:2,659 --> 0:8:6,61
managers or musicians.
They go out and they find talent, they look


104
0:8:6,61 --> 0:8:11,259
at it in other people.
So that really to me... if life has any secret


105
0:8:11,259 --> 0:8:15,229
it's...
it's abnegation of self, efface yourself,


106
0:8:15,229 --> 0:8:20,669
don't talk, just don't say,
if you can't stop saying "me" or "I" too often


107
0:8:20,669 --> 0:8:26,809
you are on the wrong track.
I think in the same way you turn in yourself


108
0:8:26,809 --> 0:8:31,229
it is very negative and sort of... destructive
to finding opportunity


109
0:8:31,229 --> 0:8:35,789
simply staying in the same place and knowing
what you know all the time


110
0:8:35,789 --> 0:8:44,24
I once wanted to open a restaurant where you
always get the dish that the person next to


111
0:8:44,24 --> 0:8:47,18
you have ordered
because that is the one you wish you had.


112
0:8:47,18 --> 0:8:55,35
And I always thought this thing like Netflix
they should send you a DVD


113
0:8:55,35 --> 0:8:59,49
the exact opposite to the kind that you like,
last the way you look.


114
0:8:59,49 --> 0:9:5,65
So the Amazon said “I see you liked this
novel by this novelist why not try this...”


115
0:9:5,65 --> 0:9:9,6
And you “Yeah, but this completely...”
Yes, that is the point, it is completely different,


116
0:9:9,6 --> 0:9:13,95
it is not your usual thing.
You know how we always buy, you know how your


117
0:9:13,95 --> 0:9:16,26
partner always says
"why are you buying that shirt, you got one


118
0:9:16,26 --> 0:9:18,52
that exactly like it",
you say "it is not exactly like it, it has


119
0:9:18,52 --> 0:9:22,6
slightly different color".
We like that in life, we tend to settle so


120
0:9:22,6 --> 0:9:27,93
quickly
and the best way to stop that to keep reinventing


121
0:9:27,93 --> 0:9:31,65
oneself,
I think travel is a fantastic way, that has


122
0:9:31,65 --> 0:9:36,43
never been easier, there are ways now, I think,
a lot of us try to be responsible in our travel


123
0:9:36,43 --> 0:9:39,3
because, of course,
you know, what we do to the environment by


124
0:9:39,3 --> 0:9:41,4
travelling,
but there are ways of sharing travel, travelling


125
0:9:41,4 --> 0:9:44,11
with other people, especially amongst the
young,


126
0:9:44,11 --> 0:9:49,4
they travel around the world, they share books.
This thing I only discovered a few years ago,


127
0:9:49,4 --> 0:9:52,92
this is very common in the places where young
people travel a lot,


128
0:9:52,92 --> 0:9:57,33
like, say, in Inca Trail in Peru or in the
South East Asia, you know.


129
0:9:57,33 --> 0:10:1,3
People just leave a book, and they leave the
name on it and a little note,


130
0:10:1,3 --> 0:10:5,16
they just leave it in a public place, anywhere,
and someone picks it up and say “Oh, that


131
0:10:5,16 --> 0:10:8,9
is good”, and they read the last note, they
read, and then they leave it.


132
0:10:8,9 --> 0:10:14,65
These books have a magical history, going
round.


133
0:10:14,65 --> 0:10:19,26
Travel and reading to me are such extraordinary
pleasures


134
0:10:19,26 --> 0:10:23,24
I couldn't conceive a life without them. They
constantly teach you


135
0:10:23,24 --> 0:10:27,7
And they don't just teach you about the rest
of the world, they teach you about where you


136
0:10:27,7 --> 0:10:28,71
come from
There was this saying... I think, that was


137
0:10:28,71 --> 0:10:36,8
Kipling who said it:
"What do they of England know, that only England


138
0:10:36,8 --> 0:10:39,4
know?"
And what do you know about your own country


139
0:10:39,4 --> 0:10:41,74
if your own country is the only country you
know?


140
0:10:41,74 --> 0:10:44,49
You don't know America unless you've travelled
outside and you see...


141
0:10:44,49 --> 0:10:48,43
And then you think: "Oh! Gosh, we do things
differently, I didn't know!"


142
0:10:48,43 --> 0:10:51,65
"I thought the way we did it was the only
natural and normal, but they do it completely


143
0:10:51,65 --> 0:10:54,53
differently!"
You learn so much about your own country by


144
0:10:54,53 --> 0:10:58,79
travelling
Also, I think, to me, the people I was in


145
0:10:58,79 --> 0:11:2,75
the head most..[]. I've had heroes
I'm sort of shameless about the fact that


146
0:11:2,75 --> 0:11:8,65
you admire other people
If there is a phrase that makes my heart sink,


147
0:11:8,65 --> 0:11:12,66
that's - "Not impressed".
People just say: "Yeah, it's so... I'm not


148
0:11:12,66 --> 0:11:16,98
impressed."
As if, well... who cares with your "impressed"?


149
0:11:16,98 --> 0:11:22,55
It's such a vain thing to say.
If your standards are so high that you need


150
0:11:22,55 --> 0:11:25,6
to be impressed, "to impress me you've got
to be damn good",


151
0:11:25,6 --> 0:11:29,58
I mean, there are things we don't like, there
are things we think of as substandard or ordinary


152
0:11:29,58 --> 0:11:33,96
which we can turn away from
But it's wonderful - the rush, the headlong


153
0:11:33,96 --> 0:11:39,0
of something with enthusiasm, like a puppy
for things you admire and people you admire.


154
0:11:39,0 --> 0:11:44,4
Sometimes they'll disappoint you, some great
singer or some fabulous painter or writer


155
0:11:44,4 --> 0:11:49,29
may turn out to have a pretty horrifying private
life or do unpleasant things to animals


156
0:11:49,29 --> 0:11:57,44
or whatever, but to admire is enormously helpful.
I think because it's one of the most natural


157
0:11:57,44 --> 0:12:1,22
things. And mentoring is, of course
at the heart of these most natural things


158
0:12:1,22 --> 0:12:6,54
is to sit at the feet of a master and to learn,
you know, you see it in all cultures.


159
0:12:6,54 --> 0:12:9,47
In the Eastern cultures you see a particular
image of the, you know,


160
0:12:9,47 --> 0:12:14,78
like a kung-fu or something, you know, with
a grasshopper sitting at the feet of his Shaolin


161
0:12:14,78 --> 0:12:18,81
priest,
teaching him so many things about mind and


162
0:12:18,81 --> 0:12:23,3
spirit and body and so on
but also if you wish to learn, say, the guitar,


163
0:12:23,3 --> 0:12:28,99
if not exactly a master then is usually a
friend


164
0:12:28,99 --> 0:12:32,42
and they hand you, like, "Put your finger
like that, play that, and then play that in


165
0:12:32,42 --> 0:12:36,11
that rhythm,
and then it's time for the change, and then


166
0:12:36,11 --> 0:12:39,66
that one, eh?"
and then you play awhile and say: "Wow! I


167
0:12:39,66 --> 0:12:43,21
found a new chord, and look at this, and oh,
it's very good"


168
0:12:43,21 --> 0:12:47,65
And slowly you're learning the guitar and
the time may come when you know enough chords


169
0:12:47,65 --> 0:12:54,68
"I should take a book or a video or take proper
lessons" - if you wanted proper lessons in


170
0:12:54,68 --> 0:12:56,93
that way,
But you're learning with friends, you're showing


171
0:12:56,93 --> 0:13:1,4
each other, you're learning together.
And that's really what education is. To me


172
0:13:1,4 --> 0:13:8,23
if I was go back to me after I got in university
and there were some splendid professors there,


173
0:13:8,23 --> 0:13:12,18
magnificent, world-renowned people.
And they were charming to talk to and they


174
0:13:12,18 --> 0:13:15,44
knew a lot of things.
But all the learning I really did was


175
0:13:15,44 --> 0:13:19,92
sitting with coffee in a room with friends
talking about everything -


176
0:13:19,92 --> 0:13:28,34
cosmos, and God, and Marxism, and history,
and psychology, and truth, and lies, and honesty


177
0:13:28,34 --> 0:13:30,46
-
all the things that seemed very pretentious


178
0:13:30,46 --> 0:13:32,73
later on, they seemed a bit over-earnest,
perhaps.


179
0:13:32,73 --> 0:13:37,42
but you may [] with your friends, you learn
of each other, you take pleasure,


180
0:13:37,42 --> 0:13:41,96
like, say, "Have you seen this new chord?"
and some new ideas you've picked up


181
0:13:41,96 --> 0:13:47,87
So, again, - learning is all about other people.
It's not about yourself with your head in


182
0:13:47,87 --> 0:13:50,14
a book. I mean there are things you can learn
of course,


183
0:13:50,14 --> 0:13:55,96
i.e. dummies' guides and serious instructional
works, but


184
0:13:55,96 --> 0:13:59,73
I don't think that many people I know who've
mastered anything have done so from that.


185
0:13:59,73 --> 0:14:3,44
They've done it through their interaction
with others.


186
0:14:3,44 --> 0:14:12,69
I would say that probably one of the most
wonderful things you can be given in life


187
0:14:12,69 --> 0:14:19,44
is the ability to give.
Sometimes, because I've had a lucky life,


188
0:14:19,44 --> 0:14:25,46
I have an opportunity to give something, whatever,
it was time or money or whether it might be,


189
0:14:25,46 --> 0:14:30,6
or presentation, or speech, or something,
[and people say... which I guess is ...] Which


190
0:14:30,6 --> 0:14:34,58
would you rather be?
Would you rather be someone who asked for


191
0:14:34,58 --> 0:14:37,13
help or money
or would you rather be someone who is in the


192
0:14:37,13 --> 0:14:42,3
position to give it?
So obvious, which it is. No one wants to ask,


193
0:14:42,3 --> 0:14:47,49
everyone wants to give.
And it's astonishes me when I do meet people


194
0:14:47,49 --> 0:14:52,58
in my profession who are closed to turning
up to anything.


195
0:14:52,58 --> 0:14:56,38
I mean I can understand somebody who wish
to guard their privacy and they don't want


196
0:14:56,38 --> 0:14:58,89
to be on a red carpet just because it is a
charity event


197
0:14:58,89 --> 0:15:6,57
but there are so many ways you can use any
accumulated wealth or reputation or influence


198
0:15:6,57 --> 0:15:10,11
you may or may not have, that are helpful
for other people!


199
0:15:10,11 --> 0:15:13,93
And that's just most natural and wonderful
thing to pass it on.


200
0:15:13,93 --> 0:15:18,779
Almost everything that I do, I sort of aim
at my 14-15-year-old self


201
0:15:18,779 --> 0:15:24,12
I had a very troubled childhood - it ended
up with me going to prison


202
0:15:24,12 --> 0:15:29,6
I still want to talk to that young me, I still
want to do things for him


203
0:15:29,6 --> 0:15:35,16
And this is the book I would like him to have
read when he was 16 - so the thing I write


204
0:15:35,16 --> 0:15:39,35
Not that I hope that my books are preachy
or teachy


205
0:15:39,35 --> 0:15:49,54
But I just think - sharing the benefits of
life *is* the benefit of life, oddly enough.


206
0:15:49,54 --> 0:15:55,8
I think probably everybody watching me now
has more power, in any real sense, in which


207
0:15:55,8 --> 0:15:59,21
power matters,
than, say, Louis the XIV or Napoleon


208
0:15:59,21 --> 0:16:4,44
without the power of life and of death, which
is probably what we don't want, so it is quite


209
0:16:4,44 --> 0:16:7,74
good
just in times when Napoleon wanted to know


210
0:16:7,74 --> 0:16:9,56
something
even he had to send some people out to Egypt


211
0:16:9,56 --> 0:16:14,63
and bring him back stones or something
and scholars will gather and talk about it


212
0:16:14,63 --> 0:16:19,0
and similarly, if he wanted the spice,
he'd ships go away and come back and we could


213
0:16:19,0 --> 0:16:22,87
go to a store in a corner of the street
where the bounty of all five continents is


214
0:16:22,87 --> 0:16:27,22
heaped up in ways that never been known.
We have access to everything. And most importantly,


215
0:16:27,22 --> 0:16:34,19
to information, to knowledge.
But is it knowledge? And where does it come


216
0:16:34,19 --> 0:16:37,7
from? How can we trust it?
And is knowledge the same thing as truth?


217
0:16:37,7 --> 0:16:43,43
Is knowing that the Spanish Armada attacked
Britain in 1588, actually knowledge,


218
0:16:43,43 --> 0:16:49,529
or is it simply, in today's technology terms,
a sort of piece of metadata that just flagged


219
0:16:49,529 --> 0:16:52,18
in history?
It's really no more than that.


220
0:16:52,18 --> 0:16:58,18
Without knowing what that means - 1588, Armada
- it's pointless - or 1776, or whatever date


221
0:16:58,18 --> 0:17:5,25
you choose.
And for me, I think, the history of the world


222
0:17:5,25 --> 0:17:8,47
that has arrived to this point where I can
speak and it can be watched


223
0:17:8,47 --> 0:17:11,839
by people in all kinds of ways and with all
kinds of devices,


224
0:17:11,839 --> 0:17:15,35
and can stay for eternity, [rest you on service]
and who knows where


225
0:17:15,35 --> 0:17:23,769
[the whole things] - it all comes from inquiry,
it all comes from open inquiry.


226
0:17:23,769 --> 0:17:29,23
And the word really is "empiricism," which
is a strange word, but what it means is testing


227
0:17:29,23 --> 0:17:33,509
things.
You don't take anything on trust. You test


228
0:17:33,509 --> 0:17:40,409
it out.
If a book says, like: "You shall have no foreskin,"


229
0:17:40,409 --> 0:17:45,779
or "You must not eat shellfish,"
you can choose to say: "This is the Word of


230
0:17:45,779 --> 0:17:49,519
the Divine Being," if you like.
It doesn't really get you very much forward,


231
0:17:49,519 --> 0:17:54,749
but it can connect you to the history of your
people. I'm not here to disrespect that.


232
0:17:54,749 --> 0:17:59,749
Those happen to be a lot of that for my people,
as it happens in -- I don't know -- [] that


233
0:17:59,749 --> 0:18:10,409
I have no choice and I eat sea food... whatever
But for the rest, I need to know why is that,


234
0:18:10,409 --> 0:18:16,47
why somebody's telling me what is the case.
I need to question it and to test it. Authority


235
0:18:16,47 --> 0:18:24,299
comes from the validity of information,
being repeatable, being open, being free,


236
0:18:24,299 --> 0:18:32,99
and not coming with a threat,
and not being just told: "This is the case,


237
0:18:32,99 --> 0:18:38,35
and you must believe it - or you die."
which is, as we know, probably the biggest


238
0:18:38,35 --> 0:18:41,7
problem facing the world, the people who says
things like that.


239
0:18:41,7 --> 0:18:46,299
And unfortunately, it's the young they appeal
to.


240
0:18:46,299 --> 0:18:51,309
You're unlikely to find a 50-year-old being
converted to a fundamentalist belief in something


241
0:18:51,309 --> 0:18:55,21
which means that they think people should
die for, not


242
0:18:55,21 --> 0:18:59,809
believing the right thing, or using casual
language about their divinity, or whatever.


243
0:18:59,809 --> 0:19:5,29
You won't find a 50-year-old who - you may
find one who's grown up, but try to persuade


244
0:19:5,29 --> 0:19:7,57
a 50-year-old
They just know the world too well, they'll


245
0:19:7,57 --> 0:19:11,149
go "oh, come on!".
But unfortunately, a 18-year-old, who's lost,


246
0:19:11,149 --> 0:19:16,9
or feels that the world is unjust - he's right,
you know, it *is* unjust -


247
0:19:16,9 --> 0:19:20,619
it might be better, if we all ordered and
well-behaved. It might be!


248
0:19:20,619 --> 0:19:25,59
But we know that "ordered" is a dangerous
word.


249
0:19:25,59 --> 0:19:30,61
And the riotous, chaotic freedom we enjoy,
which causes so much of a headache for all


250
0:19:30,61 --> 0:19:35,669
of us,
is infinitely better than rigidity of tyranny


251
0:19:35,669 --> 0:19:38,98
and control.
And religious fundamentalism is just another


252
0:19:38,98 --> 0:19:43,8
kind of fascism, it's another kind of communism,
it's an extreme, dictatorial way of telling


253
0:19:43,8 --> 0:19:47,73
people how to behave.
And given that my power comes from a book,


254
0:19:47,73 --> 0:19:55,769
whether it's Karl Marx or it's a holy text
- that's, to me, the dangerous thing.


255
0:19:55,769 --> 0:20:0,679
The truth is [bully] and complicated and difficult
and all but an [ "oooh, huh..."]


256
0:20:0,679 --> 0:20:5,39
I trust people, you know, the great, one of
the wisest heads who ever lived on this planet


257
0:20:5,39 --> 0:20:9,35
was a philosopher called Socrates, and he's
famous for asking questions


258
0:20:9,35 --> 0:20:13,57
he never gave answers
but the questions are so acute; the innocence


259
0:20:13,57 --> 0:20:19,279
of a Socratic question:
"I wonder what we mean by that." You know?


260
0:20:19,279 --> 0:20:25,919
and even down to, you know, ethics
at what age might it be right ever to abort


261
0:20:25,919 --> 0:20:30,289
a foetus, on what age?
if you did it on Wednesday, it would be child-killing


262
0:20:30,289 --> 0:20:33,279
if its on the Tuesday before, it's okay, how
can that be?


263
0:20:33,279 --> 0:20:37,179
You know, these things are very complicated,
and never stop thinking like that!


264
0:20:37,179 --> 0:20:42,23
Never stop being a child, who says "Why? Can
that be right?"


265
0:20:42,23 --> 0:20:46,929
There's Zeno, one of my favourite philosophers,
had a pupil next to him and he gave him a


266
0:20:46,929 --> 0:20:48,95
bean and said
to put it on the table in front of him and


267
0:20:48,95 --> 0:20:52,34
said "Is that a heap?"
And the pupil said - "No!" So he added another


268
0:20:52,34 --> 0:20:55,309
one, "Is that a heap?"
Pupil said "No, it's not."


269
0:20:55,309 --> 0:20:57,169
He kept adding and eventually pupil said - "that's
a heap"


270
0:20:57,169 --> 0:21:0,879
So then he says, oh, then the heap is 17,
I take this away, it's not heap anymore.


271
0:21:0,879 --> 0:21:4,299
Is a heap 17? And he was making that exact
point


272
0:21:4,299 --> 0:21:11,32
"Oh, I see, this number of days is a life,
take one away, it's just a mass of chemicals"


273
0:21:11,32 --> 0:21:15,309
Life is full of these complexities, like age
of consent is a similar one, you know?


274
0:21:15,309 --> 0:21:23,149
the police enter a room and there's a couple
making love and


275
0:21:23,149 --> 0:21:26,869
if they entered the day before it would be
statutory rape


276
0:21:26,869 --> 0:21:29,69
but because it was the day after the birthday
- it wasn't


277
0:21:29,69 --> 0:21:34,61
now, it's such a peculiar way to order a society
like that


278
0:21:34,61 --> 0:21:38,519
and I think that sort of flexibility, of being
able to


279
0:21:38,519 --> 0:21:43,94
to think openly about all kinds of problems
is really important for one's happiness and


280
0:21:43,94 --> 0:21:48,169
one's sense of self and connection with other
people


281
0:21:48,169 --> 0:21:52,419
I think, one of the interesting things about
social networking


282
0:21:52,419 --> 0:21:58,9
is what it's doing to democracy and how it
is reactivating many sides of democracy


283
0:21:58,9 --> 0:22:2,45
that both internationally, when there is,
you know


284
0:22:2,45 --> 0:22:6,389
it's not necessarily changing the world in
one fell swoop but I think


285
0:22:6,389 --> 0:22:11,269
politicians have to be so much more careful
now, because what they say is not just in


286
0:22:11,269 --> 0:22:14,529
the hands of journalists
who, after all, trade favours with them and


287
0:22:14,529 --> 0:22:19,519
may will let this one off for saying this
but we're all citizen journalists to some


288
0:22:19,519 --> 0:22:23,399
extent by blogging or microblogging which
is what Twitter is


289
0:22:23,399 --> 0:22:28,429
and I think it allows us to engage more in
politics and I think in young people


290
0:22:28,429 --> 0:22:32,82
there of course still is same level of cynicism
which is a perfectly justified level to some


291
0:22:32,82 --> 0:22:35,289
extent
who call it realism more than cynicism


292
0:22:35,289 --> 0:22:42,159
you know, these are human beings in these
positions of power and


293
0:22:42,159 --> 0:22:48,369
you can take silly, sort of conspiracy theory
view, be paranoid about it and all, but


294
0:22:48,369 --> 0:22:53,9
actually, we know, because we were at school
with some people who are now


295
0:22:53,9 --> 0:22:58,29
politicians of my age running the country,
and we know how stupid they are


296
0:22:58,29 --> 0:23:3,44
we know how stupid we are! And the idea that
they are clever enough to conspire in some


297
0:23:3,44 --> 0:23:7,279
brilliant way to, you know, with heads of
business to keep secrets...


298
0:23:7,279 --> 0:23:12,259
they can't keep what they do in their trousers
a secret, the idea that they can keep anything


299
0:23:12,259 --> 0:23:19,58
serious a secret is absurd!
And I think they have to be so much more honest


300
0:23:19,58 --> 0:23:24,299
now... openness.
I think there's one thing that can really


301
0:23:24,299 --> 0:23:28,34
transform our lives
it is increasing levels of openness


302
0:23:28,34 --> 0:23:35,509
it is really allowing transparency in the
way people behave and transact


303
0:23:35,509 --> 0:23:42,409
in business and in politics at all levels
and I think it's all to the good, I really


304
0:23:42,409 --> 0:23:46,69
do
and I think the fact that it's harder to be


305
0:23:46,69 --> 0:23:50,239
private is something, of course, that we juggle
all the time


306
0:23:50,239 --> 0:23:55,57
if all this openness is around, it's like
we're all living in glass houses with no curtains


307
0:23:55,57 --> 0:24:1,98
and maybe people feel a bit exposed
by participating in the openness of the world


308
0:24:1,98 --> 0:24:7,109
but in ten years time
almost everything we do will be so locked


309
0:24:7,109 --> 0:24:10,59
in to electronic systems and it already is
to a huge extent


310
0:24:10,59 --> 0:24:14,899
and even more so. I mean, just including the
way we thought and


311
0:24:14,899 --> 0:24:17,83
so much information will be known about us
and


312
0:24:17,83 --> 0:24:22,739
we have to just make sure
and I think that's the beauty in it, there's


313
0:24:22,739 --> 0:24:29,359
lots of guardians for us out there
who do make a fuss when liberty is threatened.


314
0:24:29,359 --> 0:24:32,889
The world is full and the history of the world
is full of stories of people


315
0:24:32,889 --> 0:24:38,45
who feel out of place in some way
either in their family or in their community


316
0:24:38,45 --> 0:24:43,39
that they just feel that the stork dropped
them down the wrong chimney


317
0:24:43,39 --> 0:24:47,279
and, I mean, a very common one, like me, is
- I'm gay


318
0:24:47,279 --> 0:24:52,69
so, especially when I was growing up, it was
pretty difficult to be open about being gay


319
0:24:52,69 --> 0:24:58,39
there were very few people in public life
that were known openly gay but they were somewhat


320
0:24:58,39 --> 0:25:1,49
openly camp
and it was a sort of an open secret


321
0:25:1,49 --> 0:25:6,919
But that's not what being gay is about
Flouncing around in purple dresses isn't exactly


322
0:25:6,919 --> 0:25:14,9
the whole gay experience
But also, there may be people who are born


323
0:25:14,9 --> 0:25:16,759
football player
Who grow up in a family of musicians or belly


324
0:25:16,759 --> 0:25:22,29
dancers
It's not all just bright sensitive artistic


325
0:25:22,29 --> 0:25:27,139
people throttled by the commonplace philistinism
of their parents


326
0:25:27,139 --> 0:25:32,809
It can be quite the reverse, you can just
want to be ordinary decent citizen


327
0:25:32,809 --> 0:25:37,879
who plays sport and isn't interested in all
things that your parents are.


328
0:25:37,879 --> 0:25:44,45
You feel kind of trapped
Most of us feel different, I think


329
0:25:44,45 --> 0:25:49,679
Teenagers in particular, but almost all life-uncertain
people.


330
0:25:49,679 --> 0:25:56,2
There is this tension: on the one hand, you
want to belong, you want to be a part of the


331
0:25:56,2 --> 0:26:0,629
tribe.
You want to be enclosed in a community and


332
0:26:0,629 --> 0:26:6,19
feel the friendship and all the fellowship
of being connected.


333
0:26:6,19 --> 0:26:10,519
And another part: one wants to stand alone,
and be an individual who is utterly different


334
0:26:10,519 --> 0:26:13,71
from everyone else.
"They are the tribe -- they are the muddy


335
0:26:13,71 --> 0:26:16,47
philistines, and I'm the artistic sensitive
soul."


336
0:26:16,47 --> 0:26:19,519
See, you want to be a part of the tribe, but
you want to be apart from the tribe.


337
0:26:19,519 --> 0:26:27,19
And it's that pull that I think gives enormous
creative tension, that allows people...


338
0:26:27,19 --> 0:26:30,85
It's that spark of electricity, if you like,
that makes people creative.


339
0:26:30,85 --> 0:26:34,19
It's the desire to be absolutely unique but
also a desire to belong.


340
0:26:34,19 --> 0:26:39,409
[That sense of...] so they understand other
people, what is to be a part of the community.


341
0:26:39,409 --> 0:26:43,98
But they also understand the status of an
alien and an outsider.


342
0:26:43,98 --> 0:26:49,859
And youth cultures that old people stupidly
mock, 'cause they say: "Oh, you're trying


343
0:26:49,859 --> 0:26:55,34
to be different, but you're all just the same!"
Oh-ho-ho-ho. You just don't get it, you know,


344
0:26:55,34 --> 0:26:59,989
that's not the point!
They really do [here] [outsider] ['cause they


345
0:26:59,989 --> 0:27:4,32
think they're being] clever!
"Ha! You all wear the same... rings and gothic...


346
0:27:4,32 --> 0:27:8,179
whatevers, and now you say you just want to
be different - well, you're not!"


347
0:27:8,179 --> 0:27:14,35
No, it's not this. What they are doing - as
I've described, they are belonging, but they're


348
0:27:14,35 --> 0:27:20,299
outside.
And it's that paradox, what I’d call it,


349
0:27:20,299 --> 0:27:24,559
that counterflow
that I think makes life exciting and gives


350
0:27:24,559 --> 0:27:29,269
them [the rosin that our ballet shoes can
grip the state with], if you like.


351
0:27:29,269 --> 0:27:34,419
That's a strange metaphor, I don't know where
it came from, but you know what I mean


352
0:27:34,419 --> 0:27:39,279
I think, a very good point about technology
is - yes, it connects you to people who may


353
0:27:39,279 --> 0:27:43,659
be as rare as you are.
Gives you a connection used to be - for example,


354
0:27:43,659 --> 0:27:47,279
if you liked
a particular writer, or particular comic,


355
0:27:47,279 --> 0:27:51,159
you would have to go to the nearest big town
where may be one specialist store


356
0:27:51,159 --> 0:27:55,879
where you would hang around for a fat comic
guy would come out, like, "What are you people


357
0:27:55,879 --> 0:28:0,239
doing?",
and you would say, "How much is that comic?"


358
0:28:0,239 --> 0:28:5,84
and you meet other collectors, but then you
had to go thirty miles out of town, [by home


359
0:28:5,84 --> 0:28:8,159
of your smaller town],
and you'd feel disconnected.


360
0:28:8,159 --> 0:28:14,419
Now, of course, you're constantly locked with
conversations with your fellow collectors


361
0:28:14,419 --> 0:28:19,259
and it could go down to the minutest form
of specialization,


362
0:28:19,259 --> 0:28:23,369
but it still could be three hundred people
on the planet who have that, and they can


363
0:28:23,369 --> 0:28:27,629
now be connected to each other.
Which must be very exciting.


364
0:28:27,629 --> 0:28:31,7
On the other hand, I suppose, if you've grown
up with the Internet,


365
0:28:31,7 --> 0:28:35,999
as we now have of course - people in their
twenties who've known nothing but the World


366
0:28:35,999 --> 0:28:40,559
Wide Web
- almost twenty years old, I mean - so that


367
0:28:40,559 --> 0:28:45,629
is a heck of a thought, isn't it?
And maybe they are not so surprised, they


368
0:28:45,629 --> 0:28:49,649
just pick out that is natural, that have fellow
interests,


369
0:28:49,649 --> 0:28:53,289
Collect! And that's a miracle! It's a wonderful
thing!


370
0:28:53,289 --> 0:28:58,389
Of course, yes, against that there's a privacy
issue and everything else, but


371
0:28:58,389 --> 0:29:3,29
as long as... there are dark sides in the
Internet - i mean, obviously -


372
0:29:3,29 --> 0:29:12,33
it's not just the manifest [?] once to do
with terrible pornography or whatever, but


373
0:29:12,33 --> 0:29:16,259
there's real problems that come back to the
personality disorders, if you like, of those


374
0:29:16,259 --> 0:29:22,96
who are obsessed with self.
Either if I see a YouTube film or read a blog,


375
0:29:22,96 --> 0:29:29,82
my eyes go below to the bottom of the screen
Because I get so fantastically upset by people


376
0:29:29,82 --> 0:29:33,629
who write comments...
I don't even know anybody who writes comments!


377
0:29:33,629 --> 0:29:37,97
I think that's the point!
The kind of people who put comments are themselves


378
0:29:37,97 --> 0:29:42,109
so weird and unhappy and alone and strange
-


379
0:29:42,109 --> 0:29:45,129
it's called 'trolling', you know, vicious
comments about things


380
0:29:45,129 --> 0:29:50,639
I mean, really weird. Either politically weird
or religiously weird or just so intolerant


381
0:29:50,639 --> 0:29:55,69
or so desperate to be heard!
So offensive! Just pleading: "Please listen


382
0:29:55,69 --> 0:29:58,989
to meee!" - they're saying all the time. "Listen
to me!"


383
0:29:58,989 --> 0:30:2,529
And of course you don't want to, and if you
do, it just gets upset -


384
0:30:2,529 --> 0:30:7,6
you might even be tricked into replying with
an aggressive reply to some idiot, and with


385
0:30:7,6 --> 0:30:11,97
vile opinions about things.
which they will use on a copmlete... it might


386
0:30:11,97 --> 0:30:16,399
be a puppy running around...
Some random youtube thing, and it somehow


387
0:30:16,399 --> 0:30:21,9
manages to get a thread of nastiness into
it.


388
0:30:21,9 --> 0:30:25,359
and they just want to be heard, and they are
so resentful, and so annoyed, especially due


389
0:30:25,359 --> 0:30:28,519
to other people's blogs
the fact that somebody's reading someone else's


390
0:30:28,519 --> 0:30:33,239
blog and not theirs - is madly enough!
And they may be like someone they hate


391
0:30:33,239 --> 0:30:36,34
And this even happens in technology - if you
write


392
0:30:36,34 --> 0:30:44,909
"Oh, I saw my friend the other day" [?]
[] like, two pages of anti-Apple madness - talk


393
0:30:44,909 --> 0:30:50,139
about 'get a life'!
But that all comes down to the same problem


394
0:30:50,139 --> 0:30:54,79
- these are self-obsessed people.
And because they are self-obsessed, they just


395
0:30:54,79 --> 0:30:57,519
[] build up these poisons, build up inside
them, they have to get out.


396
0:30:57,519 --> 0:31:0,809
Maybe it's better that they get out in the
common pages of the Internet, than in violence


397
0:31:0,809 --> 0:31:4,69
on the streets,
but it's still distressing for us all to see.


398
0:31:4,69 --> 0:31:8,9
I suppose the thing that I most would like
to have known or to be re-assured about


399
0:31:8,9 --> 0:31:13,29
is that in the world what counts more than
talent, that counts more than energy or concentration,


400
0:31:13,29 --> 0:31:19,609
or commitment, or anything else, is kindness.
And the more in the world you encounter kindness


401
0:31:19,609 --> 0:31:26,659
and cheerfulness (which is its' kind of amiable
uncle, or aunt)


402
0:31:26,659 --> 0:31:31,9
the better world always is.
And all the big words: [], justice, truth


403
0:31:31,9 --> 0:33:31,9
-- are dwarfed by the greatness of kindness.
