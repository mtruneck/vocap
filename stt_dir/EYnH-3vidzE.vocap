###12 SHANE SMITH: It turned out to be a comparatively short
###14 10-hour train ride from Tynda to Dipkun, which was the next
###17 town that had a North Korean camp in it.
###21 When we finally got there, it was pretty late in the day.
###23 We had to move fast.
###24 If we were going to see the North Korean camp and get back
###27 in time before the pitch black Siberian night fell and
###30 stranded us in the forest.
###32 Well, we're sort of in the middle of nowhere.
###35 But we're going to try to go to the camp now.
###37 
###40 The old chief of police of Dipkun, who we met on the
###42 train, had offered to take us out there in his new truck but
###45 was a bit worried about the bridge because it had recently
###47 been washed out.
###49 We could take this.
###50 This would be awesome.
###52 Is this us?
###53 
###56 So we are in a race against time to go see the North
###59 Korean camp.
###60 The old chief of police is driving us.
###63 
###67 He'd been the chief of police for over a decade and
###69 consequently knew the North Korean
###71 situation there quite well.
###72 RODION MIKHAILOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###73 
###76 SIMON OSTROVSKY: They get kopecks.
###77 RODION MIKHAILOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###78 SHANE SMITH: What's kopeck?
###79 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Pennies.
###80 RODION MIKHAILOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###81 
###85 SIMON OSTROVSKY: They live in smelly barracks--
###87 like dozens of people all together.
###89 RODION MIKHAILOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###90 
###98 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yeah, I think we're getting there.
###100 
###103 SHANE SMITH: The bridges is made out of old railway ties.
###108 Our buddy, the chief of police, he buys this truck on
###111 credit and then fucking risks the whole thing by driving
###114 across this fucking thing, which he doesn't even know who
###117 built it or when.
###118 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Maybe we should have taken our stuff
###119 off in case he falls into the river.
###122 SHANE SMITH: He's got balls, this guy.
###123 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yeah.
###124 SHANE SMITH: We'll have to buy him some more vodka.
###126 Hey.
###128 
###136 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Oh my god, it's completely been cleared.
###140 RODION MIKHAILOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###141 SHANE SMITH: So this is our chief of police, and he's
###143 breaking in to the North Korean camp.
###146 I love him.
###149 RODION MIKHAILOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###151 SHANE SMITH: [LAUGH]
###153 I love this guy so much.
###157 This was a whole Korean village.
###160 SIMON OSTROVSKY: They had a sign here that said, "Kim
###162 Il-Sung lives with us forever."
###164 SHANE SMITH: Because, I guess, that there have been some
###166 people who came--
###168 Simon, who's with us, being one of them--
###170 they've knocked down the camp.
###171 And they've moved on to the next village
###173 down the train line.
###175 SIMON OSTROVSKY: This used to have a slogan on it that said,
###178 "laboratory of Kim Il-Sung's theory." So they've given it
###181 over to an entrepreneur to take down.
###183 And then his benefit is he gets to sell the spare parts
###186 and metal and stuff like that.
###188 Let's try to open the door.
###190 SHANE SMITH: This was built by the North Koreans to resemble
###192 North Korea.
###193 They wanted it to be like a home away from home.
###195 And this was the laboratory of Kim Il-Sung's theory.
###199 So we're going to go check it out.
###200 
###208 So this is where they would learn about Juche, the ideals
###211 of Kim Il-Sung.
###212 The study room was a bit freaky because it had the
###214 requisite painting of Mount Baekdu, which I had seen a lot
###217 when I was in North Korea, which was where Kim Jong-Il
###220 was supposed to have been born under a double rainbow as a
###222 new star shot into the sky to mark the joyous event.
###225 But in actual fact, he was really born in a small log
###228 cabin near Khabarovsk, where we had started our journey,
###232 while the Soviets trained his dad to be the Stalinist,
###235 cult-of-personality leader of Korea after World War II.
###239 So there's a room here filled with Juche ideals.
###244 You kind of feel like you've stumbled on a cult house
###247 because there's these weird things to make candles, and
###251 fires, and homage to the Juche ideals and we're finding crazy
###256 propaganda stuff because North Korea's a cult of personality.
###260 One man runs, like a god, the country.
###262 
###265 SIMON OSTROVSKY: It's kind of got this eerie, Pompeii
###267 feeling about it.
###268 SHANE SMITH: It's such a bizarre concept that there's
###271 little North Koreas dotted around Siberia.
###274 SIMON OSTROVSKY: This would have been living quarters
###275 right here.
###276 SHANE SMITH: It's not very nice.
###277 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Pure filth.
###278 SHANE SMITH: Very disgusting.
###280 
###282 SIMON OSTROVSKY: There's one of the old dudes.
###283 
###286 SHANE SMITH: Oh shit.
###286 Oh that's--
###287 RODION MIKHAILOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###288 SIMON OSTROVSKY: He says it's fine.
###289 SHANE SMITH: Are they North Koreans?
###290 SIMON OSTROVSKY: No, but it'd to be cool if we were, and
###292 they saw us looting.
###294 SHANE SMITH: We're literally getting caught in
###295 looting right now.
###297 All smiles.
###298 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Just smile.
###298 They'll think you're crazy.
###300 RODION MIKHAILOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###301 
###306 SIMON OSTROVSKY: He says, you want to see a real Korean?
###308 SHANE SMITH: Yeah.
###309 We should get the vodka.
###310 SIMON OSTROVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###313 SHANE SMITH: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###316 Hello.
###318 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Simon.
###320 We have to cross the bridge while it's light.
###321 SHANE SMITH: Oh, OK.
###324 KIM ZUNG YUN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###326 LABORER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###327 KIM ZUNG YUN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###329 
###333 LABORER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###337 SHANE SMITH: Well, I feel bad for the guy because he's
###338 obviously terrified.
###339 So we'll blur his face.
###340 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yeah, definitely.
###341 Maybe we should let him know that we'll do that.
###343 SHANE SMITH: Yeah.
###344 When we told him not to worry and that we would blur his
###346 face, the North Korean worker relaxed a little and seemed
###349 much happier.
###350 He also told us that the main part of the workers group had
###353 moved even further up the line.
###355 So we got into another train, and we kept going.
###357 
###377 Should we get arrested?
###378 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yes.
###379
