0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,48



2
0:0:0,48 --> 0:0:3,125
HARRY CHEADLE: There's this line
that Woody Allen uses to


3
0:0:3,125 --> 0:0:5,75
open "Annie Hall." He says, "I'd
never join a club that


4
0:0:5,75 --> 0:0:7,81
would have someone like me as
a member." And that's how I


5
0:0:7,81 --> 0:0:9,21
feel about women, you know?


6
0:0:9,21 --> 0:0:11,36
Like if there's a beautiful
girl, who's into me, a real


7
0:0:11,36 --> 0:0:14,44
dish, I think there's something
wrong with her.


8
0:0:14,44 --> 0:0:15,62
That's what dating is.


9
0:0:15,62 --> 0:0:17,87
It's figuring out what's wrong
with the other person and


10
0:0:17,87 --> 0:0:20,3
going into each other's
neuroses.


11
0:0:20,3 --> 0:0:23,46
But how else are you supposed
to find love?


12
0:0:23,46 --> 0:0:24,99
My name is Harry, and
I have been a loser


13
0:0:24,99 --> 0:0:26,23
for most of my life.


14
0:0:26,23 --> 0:0:28,31
I thought I was done with my
awkward phase when "Vice"


15
0:0:28,31 --> 0:0:30,81
hired me to write about
politics, culture, and other


16
0:0:30,81 --> 0:0:32,77
important world affairs,
which should make me


17
0:0:32,77 --> 0:0:34,69
cool, but it doesn't.


18
0:0:34,69 --> 0:0:36,99
I'm still just a weird kid
who creeps people out.


19
0:0:36,99 --> 0:0:45,69
This is "All Around Losing
with Harry Cheadle."


20
0:0:45,69 --> 0:0:46,915
I don't know what's wrong
with me exactly.


21
0:0:46,915 --> 0:0:48,19
But lately--


22
0:0:48,19 --> 0:0:50,25
and by lately, I mean
the past few years--


23
0:0:50,25 --> 0:0:51,945
I've been having trouble
meeting women.


24
0:0:51,945 --> 0:0:53,76
I mean, I can meet women OK.


25
0:0:53,76 --> 0:0:56,74
I just have trouble going from
the hi, my name is Harry


26
0:0:56,74 --> 0:0:59,82
stage, to the let me
get a condom stage.


27
0:0:59,82 --> 0:1:3,56
So I'm on my way to talk to
Blake Eastman, who teaches


28
0:1:3,56 --> 0:1:6,93
people who are afraid of other
people, like me, to figure out


29
0:1:6,93 --> 0:1:8,18
how to date.


30
0:1:8,18 --> 0:1:10,715



31
0:1:10,715 --> 0:1:11,16
Hey, Blake.


32
0:1:11,16 --> 0:1:11,61
BLAKE EASTMAN: Hey, Harry.


33
0:1:11,61 --> 0:1:11,73
How are you?


34
0:1:11,73 --> 0:1:12,17
Nice to meet you.


35
0:1:12,17 --> 0:1:13,16
HARRY CHEADLE: Nice
to meet you.


36
0:1:13,16 --> 0:1:15,42
Are you ready to teach me how to
use my body so I don't come


37
0:1:15,42 --> 0:1:16,66
off like a weirdo?


38
0:1:16,66 --> 0:1:17,65
BLAKE EASTMAN: Yeah.


39
0:1:17,65 --> 0:1:18,2
All right, let's go.


40
0:1:18,2 --> 0:1:19,92
HARRY CHEADLE: All right.


41
0:1:19,92 --> 0:1:23,94
I mean, more broadly, I just
want to know how to talk to


42
0:1:23,94 --> 0:1:24,84
girls I've just met.


43
0:1:24,84 --> 0:1:26,89
I go on a lot of online
dates, you know?


44
0:1:26,89 --> 0:1:30,15
So there's that moment, where
you meet someone.


45
0:1:30,15 --> 0:1:32,45
And you're trying to figure out
do I want to have sex with


46
0:1:32,45 --> 0:1:33,5
this person?


47
0:1:33,5 --> 0:1:34,73
Do they want to have
sex with me?


48
0:1:34,73 --> 0:1:37,55
And, you know, I feel like
they can pick up on my


49
0:1:37,55 --> 0:1:37,955
nervousness.


50
0:1:37,955 --> 0:1:40,76
BLAKE EASTMAN: I think it's an
indication of anxiety for the


51
0:1:40,76 --> 0:1:42,87
most part, or what's called
soothing gestures, or


52
0:1:42,87 --> 0:1:45,2
pacifying gestures,
or self-rubbing.


53
0:1:45,2 --> 0:1:46,95
Basically, they rub themselves
to calm themselves down.


54
0:1:46,95 --> 0:1:47,46
HARRY CHEADLE: OK.


55
0:1:47,46 --> 0:1:48,44
BLAKE EASTMAN: The biggest
one men do on a


56
0:1:48,44 --> 0:1:49,53
first date is this.


57
0:1:49,53 --> 0:1:49,99
HARRY CHEADLE: Oh, this.


58
0:1:49,99 --> 0:1:50,96
BLAKE EASTMAN: I guarantee
you do this.


59
0:1:50,96 --> 0:1:51,305
HARRY CHEADLE: This.


60
0:1:51,305 --> 0:1:52,1
Yeah.


61
0:1:52,1 --> 0:1:54,195
BLAKE EASTMAN: Do you go out on
dates with anxious people?


62
0:1:54,195 --> 0:1:56,14
HARRY CHEADLE: Sometimes, you
know, because I go on online


63
0:1:56,14 --> 0:1:59,7
dates, so the people who are
online dates can get kind of


64
0:1:59,7 --> 0:1:59,8
weird sometimes.


65
0:1:59,8 --> 0:2:0,405
BLAKE EASTMAN: You know
the online pool is


66
0:2:0,405 --> 0:2:0,85
contaminated, right?


67
0:2:0,85 --> 0:2:1,698
HARRY CHEADLE: Ha, ha, ha.


68
0:2:1,698 --> 0:2:2,546
Yeah, that's a good idea.


69
0:2:2,546 --> 0:2:4,14
BLAKE EASTMAN: I would challenge
you to get the hell


70
0:2:4,14 --> 0:2:5,51
off online dating, man.


71
0:2:5,51 --> 0:2:6,33
HARRY CHEADLE: I'm thinking
about doing this


72
0:2:6,33 --> 0:2:7,29
speed dating event.


73
0:2:7,29 --> 0:2:8,864
It's like three-minute
interactions.


74
0:2:8,864 --> 0:2:10,329
It's going to be like 20--


75
0:2:10,329 --> 0:2:11,27
BLAKE EASTMAN: --how many?


76
0:2:11,27 --> 0:2:11,84
20 three-minute interactions?


77
0:2:11,84 --> 0:2:12,94
HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah,
like in an hour.


78
0:2:12,94 --> 0:2:13,82
I think that's what it is.


79
0:2:13,82 --> 0:2:15,0
It's something like that.


80
0:2:15,0 --> 0:2:17,74
So what kind of advice
do you want to give


81
0:2:17,74 --> 0:2:18,43
me to, like, make--


82
0:2:18,43 --> 0:2:20,49
BLAKE EASTMAN: OK, so movement
really works.


83
0:2:20,49 --> 0:2:23,4
If you go, literally,
like five or six


84
0:2:23,4 --> 0:2:24,8
minutes before a date--


85
0:2:24,8 --> 0:2:26,7
I mean, get there like
10 minutes early--


86
0:2:26,7 --> 0:2:28,53
and go to the bathroom, or go
wherever, and just start


87
0:2:28,53 --> 0:2:30,37
throwing as many punches or
jumping up and down--


88
0:2:30,37 --> 0:2:31,19
HARRY CHEADLE: Like
literally, like--


89
0:2:31,19 --> 0:2:32,11
BLAKE EASTMAN: You know,
I have no idea.


90
0:2:32,11 --> 0:2:34,7
Literally, it will lower
cortisol levels and increase


91
0:2:34,7 --> 0:2:35,69
testosterone levels
as you move.


92
0:2:35,69 --> 0:2:37,595
So for example, get
on the floor.


93
0:2:37,595 --> 0:2:38,29
HARRY CHEADLE: What
do you mean?


94
0:2:38,29 --> 0:2:39,37
BLAKE EASTMAN: Push ups.


95
0:2:39,37 --> 0:2:39,72
HARRY CHEADLE: Push ups?


96
0:2:39,72 --> 0:2:40,65
BLAKE EASTMAN: Yeah,
do push ups.


97
0:2:40,65 --> 0:2:41,174
HARRY CHEADLE: OK.


98
0:2:41,174 --> 0:2:44,0
All right, I'll do
some push ups.


99
0:2:44,0 --> 0:2:45,2
How many push ups do
you want me to do?


100
0:2:45,2 --> 0:2:46,2
BLAKE EASTMAN: Your
push ups are bad.


101
0:2:46,2 --> 0:2:46,643
HARRY CHEADLE: My push ups?


102
0:2:46,643 --> 0:2:47,24
Well, I haven't done
push ups that much.


103
0:2:47,24 --> 0:2:48,25
BLAKE EASTMAN: Chest up.


104
0:2:48,25 --> 0:2:48,712
Chest up.


105
0:2:48,712 --> 0:2:48,99
HARRY CHEADLE: Chest up?


106
0:2:48,99 --> 0:2:49,73
BLAKE EASTMAN: Yeah.


107
0:2:49,73 --> 0:2:50,5
All right, good.


108
0:2:50,5 --> 0:2:50,808
Get up now.


109
0:2:50,808 --> 0:2:51,67
Now jump up and down.


110
0:2:51,67 --> 0:2:53,55
HARRY CHEADLE: Just like this?


111
0:2:53,55 --> 0:2:54,18
BLAKE EASTMAN: Yeah,
but see, even your


112
0:2:54,18 --> 0:2:55,5
jumping's not confident.


113
0:2:55,5 --> 0:2:56,53
Like if you're gonna jump,
start jumping.


114
0:2:56,53 --> 0:2:58,5
Get excited about it,
or something like--


115
0:2:58,5 --> 0:2:59,495
HARRY CHEADLE: --like I'm
excited about jumping, right?


116
0:2:59,495 --> 0:3:1,25
BLAKE EASTMAN: Yeah, I still
feel that you're


117
0:3:1,25 --> 0:3:1,99
awkward right now.


118
0:3:1,99 --> 0:3:3,52
HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah, I feel
that I'm awkward--


119
0:3:3,52 --> 0:3:3,93
BLAKE EASTMAN: --because
you feel awkward.


120
0:3:3,93 --> 0:3:4,575
HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah.


121
0:3:4,575 --> 0:3:5,445
BLAKE EASTMAN: Right.


122
0:3:5,445 --> 0:3:8,38
HARRY CHEADLE: Blake filmed me
to demonstrate just how bad I


123
0:3:8,38 --> 0:3:11,23
was at standing around, then
showed me some videos of his


124
0:3:11,23 --> 0:3:12,92
body language students.


125
0:3:12,92 --> 0:3:15,36
Some of it was too subtle for
me to understand, but I did


126
0:3:15,36 --> 0:3:16,375
like his technique.


127
0:3:16,375 --> 0:3:19,35
I'm going to start videotaping
my friends for later analysis.


128
0:3:19,35 --> 0:3:19,89
BLAKE EASTMAN: Have
a go at it.


129
0:3:19,89 --> 0:3:20,246
HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah.


130
0:3:20,246 --> 0:3:20,445
Thanks to you.


131
0:3:20,445 --> 0:3:21,7
BLAKE EASTMAN: No problem.


132
0:3:21,7 --> 0:3:22,32
HARRY CHEADLE: Thanks
for doing this.


133
0:3:22,32 --> 0:3:26,38



134
0:3:26,38 --> 0:3:29,16
So I feel I learned a lot from
Blake about communicating and


135
0:3:29,16 --> 0:3:31,82
using my hands to get
my point across and


136
0:3:31,82 --> 0:3:32,69
interact with people.


137
0:3:32,69 --> 0:3:34,17
But I want to try it
out in the field.


138
0:3:34,17 --> 0:3:36,65
So I'm here in The Watering
Hole, a bar and restaurant in


139
0:3:36,65 --> 0:3:39,35
Manhattan, where I'm going to
go on some speed dating.


140
0:3:39,35 --> 0:3:42,44
And I'm going to meet 15 girls
in about 45 minutes.


141
0:3:42,44 --> 0:3:45,13
And that just seems
like a bad idea.


142
0:3:45,13 --> 0:3:46,66
But I need to try this out.


143
0:3:46,66 --> 0:3:49,64
And I need to figure
out if girls like


144
0:3:49,64 --> 0:3:50,84
me, if I like girls--


145
0:3:50,84 --> 0:3:52,57
I know I like girls--


146
0:3:52,57 --> 0:3:56,78
and I'm going to deal with my
nervousness in two ways.


147
0:3:56,78 --> 0:3:59,57
I'm going to do those exercises
Blake taught me.


148
0:3:59,57 --> 0:4:0,82
And I'm going to get drunk.


149
0:4:0,82 --> 0:4:7,24



150
0:4:7,24 --> 0:4:7,621
MAYRA PERDOMO: Hi.


151
0:4:7,621 --> 0:4:7,98
How are you?


152
0:4:7,98 --> 0:4:8,66
HARRY CHEADLE: Hi.


153
0:4:8,66 --> 0:4:9,8
I'm good.


154
0:4:9,8 --> 0:4:9,44
I'm Harry.


155
0:4:9,44 --> 0:4:12,48
I'm here for the speed dating
thing, the On Speed Dating.


156
0:4:12,48 --> 0:4:13,3
MAYRA PERDOMO: Yes, Harry.


157
0:4:13,3 --> 0:4:14,3
HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah.


158
0:4:14,3 --> 0:4:15,75
MAYRA PERDOMO: Is this
your first time


159
0:4:15,75 --> 0:4:15,8
speed dating with us?


160
0:4:15,8 --> 0:4:16,355
HARRY CHEADLE: It is, yeah.


161
0:4:16,355 --> 0:4:17,73
I have no idea of
how this works.


162
0:4:17,73 --> 0:4:18,225
MAYRA PERDOMO: You're
going to have fun.


163
0:4:18,225 --> 0:4:18,35
Don't worry about it.


164
0:4:18,35 --> 0:4:18,959
HARRY CHEADLE: OK.


165
0:4:18,959 --> 0:4:19,39
All right.


166
0:4:19,39 --> 0:4:21,55
MAYRA PERDOMO: But if you'd
like, we're just having


167
0:4:21,55 --> 0:4:22,8
everybody hang out at the bar.


168
0:4:22,8 --> 0:4:27,793



169
0:4:27,793 --> 0:4:30,16
HARRY CHEADLE: I didn't remember
exactly why Blake


170
0:4:30,16 --> 0:4:32,59
told me to exercise before
going on a date.


171
0:4:32,59 --> 0:4:34,1
Something to do with
the hormones?


172
0:4:34,1 --> 0:4:36,83
Maybe women are naturally drawn
to men who are a little


173
0:4:36,83 --> 0:4:38,6
out of breath?


174
0:4:38,6 --> 0:4:40,801
In any case, punching the air in
front of a mirror does make


175
0:4:40,801 --> 0:4:43,4
you feel like a cool, tough guy
who is ready to throw down


176
0:4:43,4 --> 0:4:44,65
at a moment's notice.


177
0:4:44,65 --> 0:4:52,11



178
0:4:52,11 --> 0:4:53,44
This looks like the kind
of place where you


179
0:4:53,44 --> 0:4:54,745
fall in love, right?


180
0:4:54,745 --> 0:4:57,751
I'm sure plenty of people have
started relationships here.


181

[BELL RINGING]


183
0:5:2,561 --> 0:5:4,6
MAYRA PERDOMO: So for all of
you that haven't done this


184
0:5:4,6 --> 0:5:6,565
before, it's very,
very simple.


185
0:5:6,565 --> 0:5:8,522
What we're going to do is
everybody's going to have a


186
0:5:8,522 --> 0:5:9,83
three-minute date.


187
0:5:9,83 --> 0:5:11,15
I hope you guys all find love.

0:5:11,15 --> 0:5:12,855

are you doing?

I'm Harry.

I'm Harry.


205
0:5:23,365 --> 0:5:23,936
- How are you?


206
0:5:23,936 --> 0:5:25,433
HARRY CHEADLE: I'm
good, I'm Harry.


207
0:5:25,433 --> 0:5:26,93
- Eric, nice to meet you.


208
0:5:26,93 --> 0:5:27,801
HARRY CHEADLE: No, no, Harry.


209
0:5:27,801 --> 0:5:27,928
Yeah.


210
0:5:27,928 --> 0:5:28,926
- Oh, Harry.


211
0:5:28,926 --> 0:5:29,674
HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah.


212
0:5:29,674 --> 0:5:29,924
No.


213
0:5:29,924 --> 0:5:31,421
It's a confusing name.


214
0:5:31,421 --> 0:5:32,419
I'm Harry.


215
0:5:32,419 --> 0:5:32,918
KAITLIN: Kaitlin, nice
to meet you.


216
0:5:32,918 --> 0:5:34,415
HARRY CHEADLE: Kaitlin,
nice to meet you.

AGNES: Hi, I'm Agnes.


218
0:5:35,413 --> 0:5:35,912
Nice to meet you.


219
0:5:35,912 --> 0:5:36,91
HARRY CHEADLE: Nice
to meet you.


220
0:5:36,91 --> 0:5:37,409
I'm Harry.


221
0:5:37,409 --> 0:5:37,908
AGNES: How are you?


222
0:5:37,908 --> 0:5:38,906
HARRY CHEADLE: I'm good.


223
0:5:38,906 --> 0:5:39,405
AGNES: How's it going?


224
0:5:39,405 --> 0:5:40,403
HARRY CHEADLE: Good, good.


225
0:5:40,403 --> 0:5:40,902
Yeah.


226
0:5:40,902 --> 0:5:41,401
AGNES: Good.


227
0:5:41,401 --> 0:5:42,898
HARRY CHEADLE: How are you?


228
0:5:42,898 --> 0:5:43,896
AGNES: I'm good, fantastic.


229
0:5:43,896 --> 0:5:46,391
HARRY CHEADLE: I'm a
shy guy naturally.


230
0:5:46,391 --> 0:5:47,69
Yeah, is that coming across?


231
0:5:47,69 --> 0:5:49,38
I feel like this is like
everyone's New Year's


232
0:5:49,38 --> 0:5:49,826
resolution.


233
0:5:49,826 --> 0:5:50,539
- Ha, ha, ha.


234
0:5:50,539 --> 0:5:50,628
Totally.


235
0:5:50,628 --> 0:5:50,72
Totally.


236
0:5:50,72 --> 0:5:53,641
HARRY CHEADLE: It's like they're
either at the gym, or


237
0:5:53,641 --> 0:5:54,45
they're here.


238
0:5:54,45 --> 0:5:54,935
I like your earrings.


239
0:5:54,935 --> 0:5:55,905
They're very nice.


240
0:5:55,905 --> 0:5:57,845
But they're very
big and round.


241
0:5:57,845 --> 0:5:58,33
ANGELIQUE: Basically.


242
0:5:58,33 --> 0:5:59,31
HARRY CHEADLE: You work
with Chris Brown.


243
0:5:59,31 --> 0:6:0,86
ANGELIQUE: I'm doing a
Rihanna impression.


244
0:6:0,86 --> 0:6:1,6
HARRY CHEADLE: Oh, yeah, yeah.


245
0:6:1,6 --> 0:6:2,5
That's like representing--


246
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:3,496
GERALDINE: --yeah--


247
0:6:3,496 --> 0:6:4,492
HARRY CHEADLE: --Stalin
or something.


248
0:6:4,492 --> 0:6:5,488
GERALDINE: Yeah.


249
0:6:5,488 --> 0:6:7,48
- Are you looking for
a relationship?


250
0:6:7,48 --> 0:6:8,476
Are you looking for marriage?


251
0:6:8,476 --> 0:6:10,468
HARRY CHEADLE: Oh, God, no.


252
0:6:10,468 --> 0:6:10,966
Not marriage.


253
0:6:10,966 --> 0:6:12,46
Well, yeah, maybe divorce.


254
0:6:12,46 --> 0:6:14,452
You're not looking to get
married and have kids?


255
0:6:14,452 --> 0:6:15,448
- Well, not tomorrow.


256
0:6:15,448 --> 0:6:16,693
HARRY CHEADLE: OK, good.


257
0:6:16,693 --> 0:6:17,938
Look, thank God.


258
0:6:17,938 --> 0:6:19,432
Because I'm not up for
anything like that.


259
0:6:19,432 --> 0:6:20,428
You love surgery.


260
0:6:20,428 --> 0:6:21,27
- Yes.


261
0:6:21,27 --> 0:6:24,14
HARRY CHEADLE: And you love
cutting dogs open, basically.


262
0:6:24,14 --> 0:6:24,55
- Yeah, I like to.


263
0:6:24,55 --> 0:6:26,5
HARRY CHEADLE: I like
your earrings.


264
0:6:26,5 --> 0:6:28,258
They're very dangly and big.

[BELL RINGING]


267
0:6:29,78 --> 0:6:32,194
HARRY CHEADLE: Well, that bell,
it's very nervewracking,


268
0:6:32,194 --> 0:6:32,522
isn't it?


269
0:6:32,522 --> 0:6:33,14
- It is.


270
0:6:33,14 --> 0:6:35,966
Meeting new people is sometimes
nervous for me.


271
0:6:35,966 --> 0:6:38,4
And then, like, the
bell goes off.


272
0:6:38,4 --> 0:6:38,92
And like, oh, God,
what's happening?


273
0:6:38,92 --> 0:6:39,23
NICKEE: Oh, it's over.


274
0:6:39,23 --> 0:6:40,42
HARRY CHEADLE: Fuck meeting
new people.


275
0:6:40,42 --> 0:6:41,865
I don't need this.


276
0:6:41,865 --> 0:6:44,19
I could be more enthusiastic,
I guess.


277
0:6:44,19 --> 0:6:47,91



278
0:6:47,91 --> 0:6:50,61
By the end of the speed dates,
I felt like a slightly drunk,


279
0:6:50,61 --> 0:6:52,43
squeezed-out dishrag.


280
0:6:52,43 --> 0:6:55,34
I'd be surprised if any of my
dates liked me, because I sure


281
0:6:55,34 --> 0:6:57,43
hated myself.


282
0:6:57,43 --> 0:6:58,75
Well, that wears you out.


283
0:6:58,75 --> 0:6:59,325
Jesus.


284
0:6:59,325 --> 0:7:6,44



285
0:7:6,44 --> 0:7:9,78
So it turns out that meeting
15 people for three minutes


286
0:7:9,78 --> 0:7:13,19
each in 45 minutes is kind
of stressful and


287
0:7:13,19 --> 0:7:14,0
kind of not that helpful.


288
0:7:14,0 --> 0:7:17,5
I was trying to do everything
Blake taught me.


289
0:7:17,5 --> 0:7:19,29
I was trying to be positive
with my body language.


290
0:7:19,29 --> 0:7:21,53
But the truth is that when
you're meeting people, you


291
0:7:21,53 --> 0:7:24,0
think about where your feet are
or where their feet are,


292
0:7:24,0 --> 0:7:25,93
or where your hands are supposed
to be, or if they're


293
0:7:25,93 --> 0:7:26,87
supposed to be waving around.


294
0:7:26,87 --> 0:7:28,28
You're thinking about
the person.


295
0:7:28,28 --> 0:7:30,1
Sometimes it just doesn't
work out.


296
0:7:30,1 --> 0:7:31,25
You're just not compatible.


297
0:7:31,25 --> 0:7:32,41
But I think that's OK.


298
0:7:32,41 --> 0:7:36,97
You know, it's OK, actually, not
to like that many people


299
0:7:36,97 --> 0:7:38,51
and to wait around for the
people that you like.
