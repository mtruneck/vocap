###0 
###28 SAMIR KRIM: That was a fun cruise.
###29 Like, we would just go from Bastille, which is on the
###32 other side of town, and we would just ride, you know?
###34 All along the Seine.
###36 Come skate that spot, then go skate that spot, then go skate
###39 the museum.
###40 And in the day, you just went through the whole city.
###42 
###61 This is Rue des Saints Peres.
###63 It's a cool spot we used to hang out, back then when they
###66 didn't put this bar.
###67 It used to be just manual pads.
###69 You go from the top, and you just go down.
###71 You don't even have to push.
###73 Just manual, trick, manual, trick, and then [INAUDIBLE]
###75 at the end.
###78 SAMIR KRIM: No.
###78 See?
###79 There's no one now, because you've got to have a little
###81 pop to skate the thing.
###83 
###90 It's dead now.
###92 It's so bad, because in the middle of Paris here was a
###94 cool hangout spot.
###95 And you're in the nice neighborhood.
###97 This is actually the Medical University.
###99 The girl's still coming out.
###102 It's very funny.
###103 -Do Parisian girls like skaters?
###107 SAMIR KRIM: I don't know.
###110 They don't like Joseph, though.
###112 I don't think it's nice to pick up girls with the line,
###115 hey, I skate.
###117 It's just like a hobby here, you know?
###119 You skate.
###119 That's a hobby.
###119 That's it.
###120 Maybe like 10 people here in France live out of skating,
###122 but the rest is just for fun, you know?
###126 JOSEPH BIAIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###128 
###139 SAMIR KRIM: He always picks on me for not skating around, and
###141 just sticking [INAUDIBLE].
###143 And I'm like, yo, when I was your age, me and my friends,
###146 we used to just skate all around the city, cruising,
###149 finding new spots.
###150 
###161 I'm older now.
###162 I'm like 10 years older than him, and if I go out for
###164 skating, it's like, I got two hours.
###166 So I'm just going to go to a spot, meet up with the boys,
###168 and just skate, you know?
###170 He's always like, yo, let's go cruise.
###171 And I'm like, I did that.
###173 We did that.
###175 JOSEPH BIAIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###181 SAMIR KRIM: He's always like, oh, you used to skate there.
###183 You used to skate there.
###184 Like, yeah.
###186 JOSEPH BIAIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###188 
###195 SAMIR KRIM: He always skates with different people.
###197 Like, anyone is in town, he will go skate with him.
###200 That's what's cool with him.
###202 In it for the right reasons.
###204 
###206 We're in Bastille right now.
###208 Bastille is center of the city.
###210 It's my center of the city.
###212 That's where I grew up.
###213 I grew up like a block from here, and it's really like my
###217 neighborhood here.
###218 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###220 
###231 It became actually one real spot here in Paris, because it
###233 was one of the first ledge spots we really had
###236 downtown, you know?
###237 -Who was the first person you saw skate here?
###241 SAMIR KRIM: I think the first one is these
###243 guys from Mad Circle--
###244 Scott Johnston, Rene Matthyssen, and I think Rob
###248 [INAUDIBLE] was there too.
###249 I was going out of school, and every night after school, I
###252 would meet up my friends here.
###254 I think I showed up early, like around 5:00 or something,
###256 and I'm just here alone with those guys, and the skating.
###259 It was just crazy.
###260 
###265 And then one day, they put those anti-skate things to
###267 keep us away from here.
###269 JOSEPH BIAIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###270 
###276 SAMIR KRIM: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###279 JOSEPH BIAIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###282 SAMIR KRIM: There's a lot to skate.
###282 Like, these little gaps, this ledge, the little manual pad
###286 right there.
###287 It's a generation thing, you know?
###289 It's like, there's always a new spot, new group of people,
###291 then it's going to be the next one, and then--
###293 so we're just at that time.
###295 That timing.
###296 It was us skating here.
###297 
###304 There's a lot of memories when I come here.
###306 I just remember a lot of things--
###309 the people that skate here with us, the stories that
###311 happened to us, you know?
###312 One day, one guy just shot himself right there.
###315 We were trying to go to the phone, and trying to call the
###318 police and stuff, and the guy is just--
###319 he missed himself, you know?
###320 He's just on the floor like that, with a
###322 little bit of blood.
###323 
###335 JOSEPH BIAIS: So where I live, the train station is just in
###339 front of my house.
###340 So I just have to walk for 20 seconds, take the train, and I
###345 am in the center of Paris.
###347 -Did you tell your parents the first time you were going to
###349 skate here?
###350 JOSEPH BIAIS: No.
###350 I didn't tell them, because they were afraid about that,
###354 because I was young, and alone, and very
###357 far from the house.
###359 They don't really like it.
###360 So the first time I went with a couple of friends, and we
###365 skated the city.
###366 
###371 SAMIR KRIM: Yeah, that's what skating's all about, right?
###373 Pushing the limit.
###375 Everyone's like, don't go further than this.
###377 I remember the first time we went to Bercy was such an
###379 expedition for us.
###382 My mom was like, never go there.
###384 
###387 I think a lot of people from Europe come here to just film
###390 lines because it looks good in their video.
###393 It's a famous spot, so people are like, all right, I had a
###396 line at that Bercy spot, or I jumped on the [INAUDIBLE].
###399 JOSEPH BIAIS: Maybe it's the most easy spot to find,
###402 because everybody knows the name is Bercy.
###403 SAMIR KRIM: It's easy to find too.
###404 The subway's right there.
###404 You go, and then it's it.
###406 You see the skaters, and they're right there.
###409 Ledges all around.
###411 This gap for the people that want to jump or die.
###415 
###418 We didn't start skating that until the mid-'90s.
###420 I remember like when we came here and put the first wax on
###425 this ledge, because before, skating was just, like, little
###428 ledge, little curb.
###429 Just trying to ollie it.
###430 And you know, by the end of the '90s, skating was a lot of
###434 ledge, so it became a paradise for us.
###437 We'd come here every day, stay here all day, all night.
###441 
###463 -Perfect.
###464 
###474 We were filming for a video in '95 or something.
###476 We just came here.
###478 [INAUDIBLE], and just broke my ankle, and I never skated that
###482 thing again.
###483 JOSEPH BIAIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###484 
###508 SAMIR KRIM: Go, go, go.
###509 Jump.
###510 
###513 They think like some guy [INAUDIBLE].
###515 How fuckin' crazy is that?
###517 
###522 -Who's the real French street skater?
###526 SAMIR KRIM: For me, Stephane was.
###528 Everywhere you go, you see Stephane Larance skating.
###531 He was so good.
###532 He could do everything.
###533 I'm talking 12 years ago, 15 years ago, he was all the way
###537 on top of everything.
###539 I saw him skate here, skate at the dome, skate everywhere.
###543 Skate the wave.
###544 He would just skate everything.
###545 He was very, very good.
###547 JOSEPH BIAIS: Stephane was the most famous Parisian.
###549 skater.
###549 Because I'm not from Paris, I am from the suburbs, and when
###553 I was very young, I used to come in Paris and have a one
###558 hour train journey to come here.
###560 And so I was coming to the dome and saying, oh, there's
###564 Stephane Larance.
###565 
###569 STEPHANE LARANCE: We're at the dome, one of the
###570 main spots in Paris.
###571 It's pretty cool, because you can just come no matter the
###574 weather or the time.
###575 There will always be skaters here.
###579 It's really crazy because it's all marble and it's pretty
###581 smooth and open space.
###582 And people just let us skate.
###584 
###588 There was always a big scene in Paris.
###591 And I met one guy that was a skater that
###593 was skating at Trocadero.
###595 Then we became friends, and he took me to skate with the guys
###598 at Trocadero.
###599 Then I just came here every week.
###602 We just came down, and they were--
###604 actually, there was nothing here but marble--
###608 like, pieces of marble everywhere.
###610 And we were just looking at this platform up there, and we
###612 just thought that they were building a skate spot for us.
###615 -So when they were finishing down below, this is where you
###620 guys skated?
###621 STEPHANE LARANCE: Yeah, this is where we
###621 were skating, yeah.
###622 The ledge and the stair were just going in circles all day.
###627 Some of the best skate memories have been here.
###630 
###635 -Is there a certain trick that you saw on this ledge that you
###638 were like, man, I can't believe someone did that.
###640 STEPHANE LARANCE: Yeah.
###640 Flo.
###643 Gnarly Crook.
###644 
###649 Flo just killed this spot.
###652 
###667 And this spot used to be so smooth.
###669 It's so good now.
###671 It's all cracked everywhere.
###672 The spot has had too much success.
###675 If you come here in the summertimes, so
###678 many skaters here.
###682 -Has it ever been a problem skating here?
###684 STEPHANE LARANCE: Yeah.
###684 There's always problems.
###685 But every two years or something, they just try to
###691 get the skaters out of here, and it just lasts for like a
###695 month or two.
###696 And then, since everybody just come and skate here anyway,
###700 they just sort of give up.
###702 And so they just let us skate.
###705 -So this was the big double set.
###707 STEPHANE LARANCE: Yeah.
###708 Pretty big double set.
###710 We've been skating this spot for a long time, but not a lot
###713 of tricks have been done.
###714 Only a few manage to skate it, because it takes a lot of
###718 energy to push, then to fall, then to go back and to push
###721 and to fall.
###724 It's even bigger when you try to skate it.
###727 It's really big.
###729 
###747 "FRENCH" FRED MORTAGNE: I spent about 15
###749 million hours here.
###752 '94 to, I don't know, '97, '96, we've been here all the
###757 time filming.
###759 That's where I pretty much learned filming.
###763 Yeah, this spot is the main plaza in Lyon.
###765 When they finally finished it in '94, it
###767 was like, oh, paradise.
###770 When they finished the plaza, that was the turning point
###772 where skateboarding went back to the street in Lyon.
###776 Watching the first 411s, there was virtually all the
###780 skateboard community in 411.
###782 Each new issue, I was like, I'm sure there's going to be
###785 some French guys.
###786 And they never came.
###787 And I was like, ahh!
###790 So maybe I have to do it.
###792 I'm filming.
###793 Maybe I'll just send footage, and maybe they want to use it.
###796 And that's what happened.
###797 
###800 411 people like Steve Douglas, I sent him all the VHS videos
###806 from here, and then he was like, oh, it's really good.
###809 You should send stuff for 411 And then J.B.,
###812 oh, it's really good.
###813 And the second time I sent a video, J.B.
###817 Had improved a lot.
###818 He was skating really well.
###820 And then they were like, oh, that's it.
###822 We want [INAUDIBLE].
###824 So I was like, oh, videos are important.
###829 So that was the first thing that pushed me to keep going.
###835 And we were doing it for a purpose, not just for fun.
###838 But it was helping people, so that was good.
###843 That was a good thing.
###844 
###852 As you can see, it's in really bad condition right now.
###856 I think they redid the place twice--
###858 completely renewed the ledges.
###861 But they get fucked up really quick, and then only the other
###866 ones they're really strong.
###867 
###871 -What kind of stuff has been done on this thing?
###874 I mean, again, it seems like everything I see here is from
###877 J.B., but--
###878 "FRENCH" FRED MORTAGNE: Oh, Jeremie was skating this thing
###879 in a different way.
###881 It's the only one that I know that he will lead from one
###884 side to the other straight.
###886 That's pretty difficult.
###888 Yeah, Jeremie is the one who's been doing all the best stuff,
###890 because there's the crack at the bottom.
###893 We used to put cement so it smoothed, but now people got
###898 used to skating it this way.
###900 So when you're not a local, it's not easy to skate without
###902 the cement.
###904 But Jeremie is like, oh, it doesn't matter.
###908 JEREMIE DACLIN: When we were 17, I got
###911 interviewed by French TV.
###912 They were saying, how do you see your future?
###915 And I said, I don't see myself skating when I'm 20 years old,
###922 because it's kind of lame or whatever.
###924 But I'm 35 and I'm still skating.
###927 
###946 I was riding for Flip when they moved to America, and I
###950 didn't really want to do it.
###952 So I thought the best solution was to start a Euro company
###958 that can pay riders so they can stay in Europe.
###961 Lots of good riders were riding in Europe, and they
###965 weren't even getting paid.
###967 And if they wanted to get paid, they
###968 had to move to America.
###970 
###972 Nowadays, you can be pro and live in Europe.
###975 Before, it was impossible.
###979 SEB CURTIS: I was driving back to Scotland with my folks, and
###982 I bought a couple of magazines just for the
###984 road back in the car.
###986 And I remember, I think it probably was about '96, and I
###990 didn't really know anything about French
###992 skateboarding at that time.
###993 And I was just looking through this French magazine--
###996 it was like, I thought this guy was fucking killing it.
###999 And it was Jeremie that was doing a frontside lipslide
###1002 down a handrail or something like that.
###1003 And I think the actual interview in it was, if I
###1008 remember correctly, he was going on about how he didn't
###1011 want to move to the States.
###1012 And he was going on about how many rippers there are in
###1014 France, and you can still do it here.
###1017 And he was even saying it then.
###1019 If you ask the older dudes that kind of stopped skating
###1021 now, used to skate back in the day, all the stories, like,
###1025 Jeremie did this.
###1026 Jeremie did that.
###1027 Way back in the day.
###1029 The shit he's done is pretty ridiculous.
###1031 It definitely played a big part in European
###1033 skateboarding.
###1034 
###1040 
###1044 JEREMIE DACLIN: Foch.
###1045 Because it's the train station stop, and it's where we are.
###1052 -How far is it from the Hotel de Vile?
###1054 JEREMIE DACLIN: It's across the bridge from the river.
###1057 -Who's the first person to skate this spot?
###1060 JEREMIE DACLIN: I think it was me.
###1062 First I did ollie [INAUDIBLE]
###1064 on it, and then 50/50 on it.
###1066 -When's the last time you skated here?
###1069 
###1071 JEREMIE DACLIN: I mean, really skated?
###1073 A long time ago.
###1074 But I come here every day to skate the mini ramp, because
###1078 there's also a mini ramp.
###1079 And every time there's some skaters who are coming to Lyon
###1081 they want to see it.
###1084 
###1087 JEREMIE DACLIN: I really want to see a lipslide on it, but
###1090 you need to be goofy foot to do it.
###1094 And yeah.
###1096 
###1099 JEREMIE DACLIN: There's one, but you'll see it in the next
###1103 Cliche video.
###1104 
###1124 HUGO LIARD: We are here at the mini ramp.
###1126 It's our mini ramp.
###1127 We built it.
###1128 
###1131 Really famous, because actually, it was the first
###1133 place of the film "Lumiere." They start the cinema--
###1138 the movie.
###1139 It was here.
###1140 They filmed the door in front of there.
###1144 People come and squat, they start to build some places,
###1148 and start to do some art stuff.
###1152 And then we come, and we start to do some skate stuff.
###1156 
###1160 I am living here.
###1161 I built my house here.
###1163 We tried to build something different.
###1167 Until the wall fall, we're gonna stay here.
###1170 JULIEN "JU JU" BACHELIER: Welcome to
###1171 Hugo's place and Vincent.
###1173 
###1185 HUGO LIARD: So yeah.
###1186 This guy here, Vincent, this guy.
###1188 
###1193 Everywhere here, they're playing music.
###1195 They built the house six years ago, and then after, one year
###1200 ago, I came here, and said yeah, it's
###1202 possible to build it.
###1203 So I built it.
###1207 It's perfect.
###1208 And I have internet, and a kitchen.
###1211 Perfect.
###1212 VINCENT GUILLERMIN: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###1214 
###1223 HUGO LIARD: You can go inside.
###1225 -What's inside?
###1226 HUGO LIARD: It's my house.
###1228 I built all this.
###1229 There was nothing, and then my friend was living here, he
###1233 tells me one night, yeah, maybe it's
###1235 possible to build something.
###1237 It's possible to make it.
###1239 I was like, yeah.
###1240 Check the wood, check this carpet, you know?
###1243 There's enough to do something.
###1245 Every night, six months, I built everything, and now I'm
###1249 living here.
###1252 It's all the stuff I have, and the stuff I bring here.
###1257 So I was like, start to put everything here.
###1260 [INAUDIBLE].
###1261 It's all the stuff I have with me.
###1262 -[SPEAKING FRENCH]
###1265 HUGO LIARD: No, that's the first American board
###1267 I saw in the shop.
###1270 -[SPEAKING FRENCH]
###1271 HUGO LIARD: In a sport shop--
###1273 I'm like, this is an American skateboard.
###1275 
###1283 At the beginning, we just made some t-shirts with a marker,
###1286 like erase the logo, and on it, like, fuck, it's
###1290 our logo, you know?
###1291 Like, fuck, we put the logo on the other logo, and that's it.
###1295 Wow, it's a crew.
###1297 A lot of skateboarders do it-- oh, it's my crew.
###1300 So we started a crew, and just made 50 t-shirts,
###1304 and then 100 boards.
###1306 And next year, it was like, wow, we sell it?
###1308 OK, maybe we do 200 this year.
###1311 We will see.
###1312 JULIAN DYKMANS: Yeah, the company wasn't even existing.
###1315 It wasn't official.
###1316 We just put some money.
###1318 It wasn't an official company, so it's all black market.
###1321 HUGO LIARD: For three years.
###1324 JULIAN DYKMANS: We just wanted to do our own
###1325 thing, and we had all--
###1328 I was riding for Consolidated, and he was riding for, was it
###1332 [INAUDIBLE]
###1333 at that point?
###1334 Kind of the European guys on the American brands.
###1337 You would go, show up, and skate, and nobody was around,
###1341 and everybody had their own problems.
###1344 You don't even know why you're going there and stuff.
###1346 And you're from Europe, and then you're just like, well,
###1348 actually, we can do our little own thing, and it's more fun,
###1352 because it's your thing.
###1353 HUGO LIARD: That's a good contrast with Cliche.
###1355 For me I used to come here and skate a lot with the Cliche
###1357 guy, because they were the only ones who really moved
###1360 their ass for skate--
###1361 like move, travel, in a van, cut some
###1364 fence, and skate something.
###1368 But the style was different, so kids were like, I don't
###1372 know-- rock and roll, all of this.
###1374 Some kids were happy to see something different.
###1377 And from the beginning, it was just, fuck it.
###1382 Fuck everything.
###1383 Fuck all the company.
###1384 Fuck the consuming stuff.
###1387 And at the end, we're in the business world.
###1389 And we try to keep the spirit we had at the beginning, too.
###1395 
###1399 JULIAN DYKMANS: No, it's not hard.
###1403 It somehow comes naturally, I guess.
###1405 You always crash test those guys on the tour, and it fits
###1408 perfectly or it doesn't at all, actually.
###1411 JULIEN "JU JU" BACHELIER: Much more than
###1411 money, it's like a family.
###1413 All people get involved in [INAUDIBLE]
###1416 is like, just friendship.
###1419 And the thing is, we go on the road with a backpack with the
###1421 boards, and we just enjoy, and try to skate, try
###1425 to have a good time.
###1427 And I think it's the best treasure you can have
###1429 [INAUDIBLE]
###1430 skateboarding.
###1430 That's the roots of skateboarding.
###1432 
###1436 SAM PARTAIX: I skate for Antiz since maybe four years right
###1440 now, and that's really, really good.
###1444 Because for me, when I was a kid I was dreaming when I saw
###1449 Hugo and Ju Ju on the magazine, I was all, crazy
###1454 skateboarder.
###1455 A photographer called me and he just said, you have to come
###1459 with me, skate a bit in Lyon.
###1462 And I met this guy, and it was really, really fun and good.
###1467 And they told me, yeah, if you want, skate for Antiz.
###1470 Then I was ahh, so good.
###1472 
###1476 So [INAUDIBLE] you can not go inside.
###1478 It's private.
###1480 -What's going on in there?
###1481 SAM PARTAIX: Huh?
###1481 -What's going on inside?
###1483 SAM PARTAIX: Skating, cheating, enjoying life.
###1488 
###1506 WILFRIED AGNES: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###1507 
###1517 
###1532 BASTIEN DUVREDIER: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###1535 
###1569 
###1600 ALEXIS JAUZION: I was in Marseille, south east France
###1603 the first big bowl we got in France.
###1606 It's famous pretty much because of the bowl riders
###1608 contest that Quicksilver organized a few
###1611 years ago for us.
###1613 It's a real historical place, compared to what has been
###1616 done, which legends of skateboarding
###1617 have skated that spot.
###1619 US pros used to come more in Europe, because there was
###1624 still a lot of World Cups taking place in Europe.
###1627 So they came along to promote their brands and stuff.
###1630 And most of the time, when they were in France, they were
###1634 always managing to get two or three or four free days for
###1638 just checking Marseilles.
###1639 So there's a list of crazy names--
###1643 like, really good names of skateboarding
###1645 that have skated here.
###1646 The incredible transfer of John Cardiel with a broken
###1649 board, backside 360.
###1650 Still the craziest trick that has ever been
###1652 done in this spot.
###1654 Omar Hassan is the only one for the moment I've seen doing
###1657 McTwist in the big bowl.
###1659 But after that, years after years, the local skaters that
###1662 were also entering the bowl riders, they knew how to take
###1666 the lines, and which kind of transfer they can do.
###1669 It's kind of perfect.
###1670 What people designed almost 20 years ago
###1675 is still real skateable.

###1682 MAT BEGUE: When they did all the metro stuff in Marseille
###1685 in 1991, all the ground they took out from the town, they
###1689 used it to make all these beaches you see here.
###1691 Before, the sea was against the street.
###1694 So they decided to build a Californian
###1696 way of life, seashore.
###1699 And we had the luck to have Jean Pierre Collinet, who is
###1702 the architect of the bowl.
###1703 And he was a passionate skateboarder, and 100%
###1705 skateboarder, and he helped having this.
###1709 There has always been skating in Marseilles, but the bowl
###1711 really connected people.
