###1 ERIC KOSTON: I mean, that's probably the space.
###2 Underneath that one.

###6 SEAN MALTO: Honestly, everyone trips on Eric.
###10 It's funny, because Rick Howard trips on Eric probably
###13 just as much Stevie Perez does, still.
###16 He's just talented.
###19 MIKE CARROLL: He's like, one of the
###20 greats, and it's longevity.
###21 It's not like this one dude who's fucking doing really
###24 good for these last three years.
###26 He's been sick for 21 years or something.
###30 He's just Koston.
###31 [SKATEBOARDING SOUNDS]
###36 PATRICK O'DELL: What's up.
###36 Welcome back to Epicly Later'd.
###39 This series we're beginning is about Eric Koston.
###43 I think when you take a look at the all-time greats in
###45 skateboarding, there's definitely Tony Hawk, Mark
###48 Gonzales, Danny Way, Rodney Mullen, Andrew Reynolds, and
###53 right up there is also Eric Koston.
###56 It's undeniable that through the last couple decades, he's
###60 been far and above one of the best skaters around.
###63 Filmed some really amazing parts.
###65 And he's always not only ahead, but ahead on skating
###70 gaps, on hand rails, and perfect style.
###75 Just one of those unbeatable skaters that everyone looks to
###78 as one of the best street skaters of all time.
###81 And I'm super stoked he's on the show.
###83 It's kind of interesting, I interviewed Meza, and at the
###85 end of the interview, he was like, you don't really know
###87 much about Koston, do you?
###89 And I realized, I kind of didn't, other
###91 than his skate tricks.
###93 ERIC KOSTON: You son of a bitch!
###94 You're a fucking son of a bitch!
###95 PATRICK O'DELL: We get glimpses at who Koston is, but
###97 it's kind of tough.
###98 It's like kind of an enigma a little bit.
###100 So we're going to go over to his house.
###102 We're going to go to Girl Skateboards.
###104 We're going to find some people from his past.
###107 The next couple of weeks, it's all about Koston, one of the
###110 best skaters of all time.
###112 And I'm super stoked.
###113 I hope you enjoy it.
###114 
###116 ERIC KOSTON: That's how she rides it.
###119 That's how I learned how to ride a skateboard too.
###121 
###124 FEMALE SPEAKER: It don't have brakes.
###126 ERIC KOSTON: It doesn't have brakes.
###127 No, it does not have brakes.
###128 FEMALE SPEAKER: No, it tips.
###129 ERIC KOSTON: It tips.
###130 It's very tipsy.
###131 
###134 That's me.
###135 PATRICK O'DELL: Which one?
###136 ERIC KOSTON: That's me as a baby.
###138 PATRICK O'DELL: So you were born in Thailand?
###139 ERIC KOSTON: Yeah.
###140 I was born in Bangkok.
###142 My dad, he's American.
###143 He was in the Air Force.
###145 And then he met my mom in Thailand.
###149 He was stationed there, and then eight or nine months
###151 after that, we moved back here.
###153 I grew up in San Bernardino because that's where the Air
###155 Force Base was.
###157 They got a divorce pretty young.
###159 And so that's the only place she really knew.
###162 TIM GAVIN: You know Eric's from San Bernardino.
###164 And San Bernardino's basically just east of hell.
###168 I think his dad split and he had a step-dad or something.
###170 And it was pretty much the exact
###172 scenario that I was living.
###174 So that was another connection we had.
###177 ERIC KOSTON: This is a good one.
###179 Beautiful hair, look at that.
###181 I could grow that back out, too.
###183 I was 12 there, wearing this Lance Mountain shirt.
###186 I got into skating because of my older brother.
###188 It was the mid '80s, and so he was super into it.
###190 It was '85, '86.
###193 First board was a Gonz.
###195 The one Gonz with the face.
###196 Tail was already pretty worn out.
###198 It was like a hand-me-down.
###200 Because my mom was like-- they were not buying new shit.
###204 I remember I used to push around on my knee.
###207 I remember somebody telling me some horror story of somebody
###210 else doing it and hitting a crack and
###211 smashing their teeth out.
###213 That's what made me actually stand up and push.
###216 MALE SPEAKER: Do it again.
###217 PATRICK O'DELL: Would you say you were good right off the
###219 bat at skating?
###219 ERIC KOSTON: Not right off the bat, but I guess I progressed
###222 probably pretty quickly.
###223 
###225 I remember just being freaked out, like what if I
###228 just don't make it?
###228 What if I hook up and flip-- that's all you could think--
###231 hook up and flip over straight to my face.
###234 And eventually I worked my way up slowly,
###236 gradually, to the top.
###237 
###240 You know, finally like, oh, that's all you had to do?
###244 
###247 PATRICK O'DELL: So how did you get sponsored?
###249 ERIC KOSTON: I got sponsored because Eddie Elguera-- he
###252 lived in Redlands, which was right next to San Bernardino.
###254 And so we just ended up meeting that way.
###257 EDDIE ELGUERA: Slam-ola.
###259 Slammy-ola.
###261 ERIC KOSTON: Eddie, he was like an OG vert and pool dude.
###263 EDDIE ELGUERA: Ah.
###264 Ooh, got to skate.
###267 ERIC KOSTON: He was really good on mini-ramps, and lot of
###271 dancing on the coping.
###272 He invented the frontside rock-- or maybe
###274 Duane Peters did.
###275 It's still-- there's controversy there.
###277 I still think there's some beef.
###279 He invented the Elguerial, which is kind of like going up
###281 fakie, kind of a full cab into an invert.
###284 He was that mix of ripping backyard pool guy, and still
###289 skating vert as well.
###290 EDDIE ELGUERA: When I got connected with Eric, I was
###292 doing a vert demo in Highland, California.
###295 And he lived in San Bernardino.
###297 So he was always hanging around.
###298 And they said, this guy is just tearing it up.
###300 [SKATEBOARD SOUNDS]
###303 EDDIE ELGUERA: From that time, we kind of hung out a lot.
###305 I had a half pipe in my backyard, a little mini-ramp.
###309 
###311 It was just straight for hours, filming, videotaping.
###315 He was doing all kinds of stuff.
###317 He was just busting out.
###319 So way back then, when he was like 15 years old, he would
###321 just do stuff like that.
###322 And I think it helped him, really, into street skating.
###328 Just being able to do that stuff on the mini-ramps, or
###331 the vert, or transition--
###333 helped him when he went to street.
###335 [SKATEBOARD SOUNDS]
###341 EDDIE ELGUERA: Eric was always tearing it up.
###343 I'm telling you, he just had that talent that you knew that
###347 he was going to be great.
###349 ERIC KOSTON: Yeah, I was probably 14.
###353 Eddie started giving me boards from that point.
###358 No, I didn't really state like him.
###360 I just skated with him.
###361 
###363 EDDIE ELGUERA: Ohh.
###365 
###367 [INAUDIBLE].
###370 ERIC KOSTON: I mean what I'd call it, a protege?
###371 Or more of like a mentor, I think.
###376 EDDIE ELGUERA: Yeah, do that puppy.
###380 I used to flow him.
###381 We used to take him to demos.
###383 We used to go out and demo.
###384 ERIC KOSTON: There was a demo in San Bernardino, and Hensley
###386 came, and Steve Ortega.
###389 And I was just skating this quarter pipe, just trying to
###394 hometown hero it, little dude.
###396 And skating with Matt Hensley, it was like the most insane
###400 dream session too by the way.
###401 At that point, he was the best, in my eyes.
###406 Hensley was like the gnarliest dude out at the time.
###409 I guess after that, Hensley had gone back and said
###414 something to Mike Ternasky about me as well.
###417 So than Eddie told me that Ternasky wanted to meet me.
###420 EDDIE ELGUERA: At that time, he wasn't sponsored.
###422 I was trying to get him sponsored, even with H-Street.
###424 At first, they were like, no, we're not sure.
###426 We have a lot of guys on the team.
###427 I'm telling you, you need this guy.
###430 You need to get him on the team, because if not, you're
###432 going to blow it.
###435 Because I'm telling you right now, this guy
###437 is going to be amazing.
###439 TIM GAVIN: I remember when we first met him.
###440 We were just like talking to the dude, and going, there's
###444 no way this dude is getting on H-Street.
###446 I remember seeing the dude, and he was this
###447 nerdy-looking dude.
###449 I was like, who the fuck are these losers?
###452 But for some reason, maybe it was an Asian bond between us,
###454 but I just went up to him and tried to make the guy feel
###457 comfortable.
###458 There was a Castle contest that same day.
###460 We went to the contest.
###461 First time I've ever seen this guy skate, I was like, this
###463 guy's unbelievable.
###464 He was doing those 540 ollies on the quarter pipe.
###467 But he was fucking--
###469 he was doing everything.
###471 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah!
###472 [CHEERS]
###475 EDDIE ELGUERA: But then finally they came around and
###477 said, yeah, you know what, you're right.
###478 And then he just went from there and got sponsored.
###480 
###484 AARON MEZA: I first heard of him in the H-Street video.
###486 That's the first time anybody heard of him.
###487 And it was true, you kind of got the idea that it was
###490 Eddie's little protege.
###492 His only footage is in his driveway.
###493 So this must be his little buddy.
###496 EDDIE ELGUERA: He really wanted to be a professional
###498 skateboarder, gave his time to it.
###500 Actually, I think, he quit school and just was stating
###503 all the time.
###505 And I really wanted to see him succeed,
###507 because I saw the talent.
###508 
###511 What was that?
###513 ERIC KOSTON: Impossible to nosepick.
###515 EDDIE ELGUERA: I was the director of a skateboard camp
###517 in Wisconsin, Lake Owen.
###519 ERIC KOSTON: Yeah, Eddie.
###520 Oh.
###521 Where'd that one come from?
###522 EDDIE ELGUERA: I took him up.
###523 He was one of the skate instructors.
###526 ERIC KOSTON: Sorry, camera.
###526 EDDIE ELGUERA: All right, come on, man.
###527 Come on, now.
###529 You need to make it or die.
###533 Yeah, Steve.
###535 I recently heard from some guys that were campers.
###538 And then they look back now and say, man,
###540 he was my camp counselor.
###542 But he wasn't pro or anything at that time.
###544 But they knew that, man, this guy, he's amazing.
###546 
###550 I remember him doing ollie impossibles down hand rails.
###553 And it's like, people can't even do ollie impossibles.
###556 He'd be doing them down hand rails.
###558 He was doing stuff back then that was just amazing.
###560 It was just--
###562 it was cool to see.
###563 Yeah.
###565 Killer footage.
###566 
###570 Those were great times.
###570 We celebrated his 16th birthday.
###574 Yeah.
###576 So it was kind of cool.
###577 And I just took him under my wing, in terms of--
###580 just to be there for him, in terms of--
###583 maybe a father figure at that time in his life.
###586 It's OK, it's OK.
###589 Hopefully I imparted some things into to him that maybe
###592 helped him to be who he is.
###595 Yeah.
###597 [INAUDIBLE]
###598 amateur.
###599 Super good.
###601 I just believe sometimes, when you have that person in your
###604 life that believes in you when nobody else believes in you--
###608 not believe in you because of what they can get out of you,
###611 but believe in you for who you are as a person.
###614 I think that's important.
###616 Whoo.
###617
