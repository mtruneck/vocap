BRAD SPENCE: Chevy, I want you
to come over and help me out


3
0:0:5,23 --> 0:0:6,32
cranking it.


4
0:0:6,32 --> 0:0:7,69
We make a mortadella.


5
0:0:7,69 --> 0:0:10,26
It's an emulsion between
pork shoulder and fat.


6
0:0:10,26 --> 0:0:12,44
We'll fold in pistachio
and cubed fat


7
0:0:12,44 --> 0:0:13,46
back that's been blanched.


8
0:0:13,46 --> 0:0:16,93
And then pump it into a
beef bung, tie it up.


9
0:0:16,93 --> 0:0:19,29
It's done.


10
0:0:19,29 --> 0:0:21,26
You'll be amazed how big
this thing can get.


11
0:0:21,26 --> 0:0:24,104



12
0:0:24,104 --> 0:0:26,91
Crank, baby crank.


13
0:0:26,91 --> 0:0:28,58
Oh, yeah.


14
0:0:28,58 --> 0:0:46,81
This is like 15 pounds.


15
0:0:46,81 --> 0:0:47,9
My name is Brad Spence.


16
0:0:47,9 --> 0:0:49,516
And I'm the chef at
Amis restaurant.


17
0:0:49,516 --> 0:0:53,39



18
0:0:53,39 --> 0:0:55,63
I grew up in South Jersey,
and it's like all


19
0:0:55,63 --> 0:0:56,57
Italians over there.


20
0:0:56,57 --> 0:0:58,48
So I always loved
Italian food.


21
0:0:58,48 --> 0:1:0,83
To me, Italian American
food is soul food.


22
0:1:0,83 --> 0:1:2,6
So I always had that love.


23
0:1:2,6 --> 0:1:4,55
I always knew that I
wanted to do it.


24
0:1:4,55 --> 0:1:6,465
But I knew nothing really
about Italian food.


25
0:1:6,465 --> 0:1:7,99
I knew a little bit about it.


26
0:1:7,99 --> 0:1:10,43
And then once I started working
for Marc, he taught me


27
0:1:10,43 --> 0:1:11,77
everything.


28
0:1:11,77 --> 0:1:17,19
Marc Vetri started Vetri, which
is an 8 to 10 table


29
0:1:17,19 --> 0:1:18,41
Italian restaurant.


30
0:1:18,41 --> 0:1:20,48
He's the master.


31
0:1:20,48 --> 0:1:23,37
It was really when I went to
Vetri that I really started to


32
0:1:23,37 --> 0:1:26,55
understand what Italian food was
all about, and traveling


33
0:1:26,55 --> 0:1:27,71
to Italy and working there.


34
0:1:27,71 --> 0:1:30,85
And that's when it all clicked
after a couple years of


35
0:1:30,85 --> 0:1:32,42
working for Marc.


36
0:1:32,42 --> 0:1:34,245
Marc was looking to open
more restaurants.


37
0:1:34,245 --> 0:1:35,86
I was like, yeah, let's go
[INAUDIBLE], let's go


38
0:1:35,86 --> 0:1:36,34
[INAUDIBLE].


39
0:1:36,34 --> 0:1:38,88
Every day, [INAUDIBLE], let's go
look for space, bugging him


40
0:1:38,88 --> 0:1:39,36
for a year.


41
0:1:39,36 --> 0:1:40,91
Finally, he was like, relax.


42
0:1:40,91 --> 0:1:42,42
I think he realized that
it was time for me


43
0:1:42,42 --> 0:1:44,1
to have my own thing.


44
0:1:44,1 --> 0:1:46,485
So that's when we went out and
shopped around for spots.


45
0:1:46,485 --> 0:1:49,64



46
0:1:49,64 --> 0:1:51,5
We definitely have the
Roman classics.


47
0:1:51,5 --> 0:1:53,31
We have the cacio e pepe.


48
0:1:53,31 --> 0:1:56,7
Tonnarelli that we make here,
black pepper, a little bit of


49
0:1:56,7 --> 0:1:59,41
olive oil, a little bit of
butter, and pecorino cheese.


50
0:1:59,41 --> 0:2:1,46
That's a classic Roman pasta
that you're going to have in


51
0:2:1,46 --> 0:2:3,5
every trattoria in Rome.


52
0:2:3,5 --> 0:2:5,4
And then we do some
nontraditional stuff, like the


53
0:2:5,4 --> 0:2:6,47
veal tongue.


54
0:2:6,47 --> 0:2:8,58
Which again, I've never
had that in Italy.


55
0:2:8,58 --> 0:2:10,375
But it's something that
it feels like you


56
0:2:10,375 --> 0:2:11,89
would have in Italy.


57
0:2:11,89 --> 0:2:13,53
This is definitely one of those
dishes when my family


58
0:2:13,53 --> 0:2:15,2
comes in, I don't tell
them what is.


59
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:16,73
And they're like, what was that
thing in the beginning?


60
0:2:16,73 --> 0:2:18,32
What was that little crispy
piece of meat?


61
0:2:18,32 --> 0:2:20,41
I'm like, oh, that
was veal tongue.


62
0:2:20,41 --> 0:2:21,17
That was veal tongue?


63
0:2:21,17 --> 0:2:21,97
Oh my god.


64
0:2:21,97 --> 0:2:23,91
That was my favorite thing
of the whole night.


65
0:2:23,91 --> 0:2:25,93
But this is something
that we've kind of


66
0:2:25,93 --> 0:2:26,594
become known for.


67
0:2:26,594 --> 0:2:28,586
It's going to be one of
our signature things.


68
0:2:28,586 --> 0:2:32,8



69
0:2:32,8 --> 0:2:33,99
So we went out with Craig,
my sous chef.


70
0:2:33,99 --> 0:2:36,202
He's actually been here since
the very beginning.


71
0:2:36,202 --> 0:2:37,78
He's one of those guys
that comes in and


72
0:2:37,78 --> 0:2:39,11
works his ass off.


73
0:2:39,11 --> 0:2:40,36
He's awesome.


74
0:2:40,36 --> 0:2:44,21



75
0:2:44,21 --> 0:2:47,74
And then my brother-in-law,
Kevin, who has nothing to do


76
0:2:47,74 --> 0:2:48,75
in the food business.


77
0:2:48,75 --> 0:2:50,1
He doesn't know how
to cook anything.


78
0:2:50,1 --> 0:2:57,81
But he's been really close to
me for the last 10 years.


79
0:2:57,81 --> 0:3:1,76
We are going to Paesano's
sandwich shop.


80
0:3:1,76 --> 0:3:3,85
It's only been open for
a couple years.


81
0:3:3,85 --> 0:3:7,74
but eventually it will become
an institution.


82
0:3:7,74 --> 0:3:9,94
It's my buddy, Peter
McAndrews.


83
0:3:9,94 --> 0:3:11,54
He just really cares about
what he's doing.


84
0:3:11,54 --> 0:3:12,37
It's just not a sandwich.


85
0:3:12,37 --> 0:3:13,53
It's really something special.


86
0:3:13,53 --> 0:3:15,74
And it's really fucking good.


87
0:3:15,74 --> 0:3:16,2
PETER MCANDREWS:
I got Peronis.


88
0:3:16,2 --> 0:3:17,96
You guys got Tecate and shit?


89
0:3:17,96 --> 0:3:19,145
BRAD SPENCE: I don't know
what the hell this is.


90
0:3:19,145 --> 0:3:19,725
This was in our basement.


91
0:3:19,725 --> 0:3:21,27
I just threw it on ice
for these guys.


92
0:3:21,27 --> 0:3:24,2
Do want us to help you out?


93
0:3:24,2 --> 0:3:25,321
We'll go back there.


94
0:3:25,321 --> 0:3:27,97
Two Irish guys cooking
Italian food.


95
0:3:27,97 --> 0:3:29,66
He was kind of disappointed
in the way


96
0:3:29,66 --> 0:3:31,4
sandwiches were in Philly.


97
0:3:31,4 --> 0:3:31,74
So he was like, fuck it.


98
0:3:31,74 --> 0:3:32,64
I'm going to open
my own place.


99
0:3:32,64 --> 0:3:33,58
So he opened it up.


100
0:3:33,58 --> 0:3:35,82
And as soon as he opened,
I would hear some people


101
0:3:35,82 --> 0:3:36,27
talking about it.


102
0:3:36,27 --> 0:3:37,255
You got to go to this place.


103
0:3:37,255 --> 0:3:38,11
We went one time.


104
0:3:38,11 --> 0:3:39,62
I took all the guys
in the kitchen.


105
0:3:39,62 --> 0:3:40,69
We went there and got
every sandwich.


106
0:3:40,69 --> 0:3:42,135
They were just awesome.


107
0:3:42,135 --> 0:3:43,22
He makes everything there.


108
0:3:43,22 --> 0:3:44,52
He makes his own bread.


109
0:3:44,52 --> 0:3:46,965
He makes all his own roasted
meats, and stuff.


110
0:3:46,965 --> 0:3:48,2
It's good stuff.

eat good food than be

I go, look, I understand
that you are under the


122
0:4:15,57 --> 0:4:18,209
misconception that the Philly
steak is the thing to have


123
0:4:18,209 --> 0:4:19,529
when you come to Philly.


124
0:4:19,529 --> 0:4:21,389
That's the sandwich,
the Philly.


125
0:4:21,389 --> 0:4:24,35
But trust me when I
say that what you


126
0:4:24,35 --> 0:4:26,53
should have is the Paesano.


127
0:4:26,53 --> 0:4:28,89
It's like, do you want
pussy in your mouth?

0:4:28,89 --> 0:4:30,47
Do you like eating pussy?

to go wrong.

up there.

called the Liverace.

fried chicken livers.

And it makes your mouth
sing like Liberace.

sopressata, garlic mayonnaise,

orange, a little gorgonzola.

much salt, and so much flavor.

when you eat it.

the food, if you don't know

how it's supposed to
taste like, you


182
0:6:31,7 --> 0:6:35,79
can't cook it, period.
