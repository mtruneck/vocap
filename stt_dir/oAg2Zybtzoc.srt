CHARLET DUBOC: I realize that
there are fashion weeks going


6
0:0:12,622 --> 0:0:16,26
on all over the world all the
time that aren't Paris, New


7
0:0:16,26 --> 0:0:17,672
York, London, Milan.


8
0:0:17,672 --> 0:0:21,0
The episode you're about to
watch is one of our favorites,


9
0:0:21,0 --> 0:0:22,7
Colombia Fashion Week.


10
0:0:22,7 --> 0:0:26,12
It's got everything in there,
stroppy models, urban pole


11
0:0:26,12 --> 0:0:31,24
dancing, Pablo Escobar's
brother's even in there, and a


12
0:0:31,24 --> 0:0:34,7
rather grisly bum implant
operation.


13
0:0:34,7 --> 0:0:35,607
So, yeah.


14
0:0:35,607 --> 0:0:38,78
Here it is, Fashion Week
International, Colombia.

CHARLET DUBOC: Welcome to
Fashion Week International, a


17
0:0:46,43 --> 0:0:49,5
new show that reports on the
most fabulous fashion weeks in


18
0:0:49,5 --> 0:0:52,81
the world and the culture and
politics behind them.


19
0:0:52,81 --> 0:0:56,14
We were here for Colombia
Fashion Week, a celebration of


20
0:0:56,14 --> 0:0:59,76
Colombia's second most famous
export, beautiful girls.

CHARLET DUBOC: Do you
know there's a


35
0:1:47,4 --> 0:1:47,865
fashion week going on?


36
0:1:47,865 --> 0:1:49,35
MALE SPEAKER 4:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


37
0:1:49,35 --> 0:1:50,6
CHARLET DUBOC: Shh.


38
0:1:50,6 --> 0:1:54,795



39
0:1:54,795 --> 0:1:58,465
Most fashion weeks are
synonymous for cocaine.


40
0:1:58,465 --> 0:2:1,843
This fashion week is having an
extra hard time totally trying


41
0:2:1,843 --> 0:2:5,892
to dispel that because Medellin
is the old stomping


42
0:2:5,892 --> 0:2:7,17
ground of Pablo Escobar.


43
0:2:7,17 --> 0:2:10,75
And yeah, we're just going to
have a big fashionable time


44
0:2:10,75 --> 0:2:12,81
and not take any cocaine.


45
0:2:12,81 --> 0:2:14,98
We started in the trade show.


46
0:2:14,98 --> 0:2:18,41
This wasn't so much high fashion
as it was high street.


47
0:2:18,41 --> 0:2:21,33
I couldn't help but notice the
women perusing and working the


48
0:2:21,33 --> 0:2:24,28
stores all flaunting
their Latin curves.


49
0:2:24,28 --> 0:2:27,5
The girls all stuck to fairly
mainstream, high


50
0:2:27,5 --> 0:2:28,776
street honey look.


51
0:2:28,776 --> 0:2:30,94
But there was some who were
at least making an effort.


52
0:2:30,94 --> 0:2:33,36
Do you really think you're
going to find the latest


53
0:2:33,36 --> 0:2:34,11
trends here?


54
0:2:34,11 --> 0:2:35,36
MALE SPEAKER 3:

0:2:35,36 --> 0:2:40,8

57
0:2:42,5 --> 0:3:3,275

0:3:3,275 --> 0:3:4,525

0:3:4,525 --> 0:3:8,125

FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


61
0:3:11,35 --> 0:3:12,975
CHARLET DUBOC: Well, it's
really weird that she


62
0:3:12,975 --> 0:3:15,885
obviously forgot that she had
bum implants and a boob job.


63
0:3:15,885 --> 0:3:22,23
But maybe there's a collective
amnesia going on here.


64
0:3:22,23 --> 0:3:25,9
That night we attended the first
fashion show of the week


65
0:3:25,9 --> 0:3:27,65
held in a disused factory
across town.


66
0:3:27,65 --> 0:3:30,12
It didn't take us long
to make friends.


67
0:3:30,12 --> 0:3:33,9
I was pounced on by the
inimitable Diego who insisted


68
0:3:33,9 --> 0:3:36,34
on taking me under his wing.


69
0:3:36,34 --> 0:3:43,62



70
0:3:43,62 --> 0:3:43,55
CHARLET DUBOC: Yeah!


71
0:3:43,55 --> 0:3:44,8
Great walk!


72
0:3:44,8 --> 0:3:57,853

0:3:57,853 --> 0:3:59,103
CHARLET DUBOC: No?


74
0:3:59,103 --> 0:4:6,13



75
0:4:6,13 --> 0:4:8,555
CHARLET DUBOC: I have to be
a little bit careful, OK.

are we doing here?


80
0:4:20,86 --> 0:4:21,17
DIEGO: OK.


81
0:4:21,17 --> 0:4:24,51
Give me one second.


82
0:4:24,51 --> 0:4:24,62
OK.


83
0:4:24,62 --> 0:4:25,67
Hello, everyone.


84
0:4:25,67 --> 0:4:25,99
OK.


85
0:4:25,99 --> 0:4:27,61
We are in Colombia Moda.


86
0:4:27,61 --> 0:4:28,3
OK.


87
0:4:28,3 --> 0:4:32,78
Which is a very important
event about money.


88
0:4:32,78 --> 0:4:35,195
I mean, about, you know,
this kind of stuff.


89
0:4:35,195 --> 0:4:36,58
You know, this is very
important for us.


90
0:4:36,58 --> 0:4:37,272
OK.


91
0:4:37,272 --> 0:4:37,62
CHARLET DUBOC: No.


92
0:4:37,62 --> 0:4:40,295
I had no idea what he was
talking about, but I knew it


93
0:4:40,295 --> 0:4:43,16
was all very important.

CHARLET DUBOC: Lost
in translation


100
0:5:5,93 --> 0:5:8,51
again, thanks to Diego.


101
0:5:8,51 --> 0:5:11,54
It was an odd show and
surprising first impression of


102
0:5:11,54 --> 0:5:12,72
Colombian fashion.


103
0:5:12,72 --> 0:5:15,47
Cocaine had gone from being the
elephant in the corner of


104
0:5:15,47 --> 0:5:18,5
the room, to just a giant pile
of prop drugs in the


105
0:5:18,5 --> 0:5:19,36
middle of the room.


106
0:5:19,36 --> 0:5:22,63
The vibe was very European, a
long way from what we'd seen


107
0:5:22,63 --> 0:5:23,87
at the trade show.


108
0:5:23,87 --> 0:5:26,21
We skipped across town
to the next show in


109
0:5:26,21 --> 0:5:27,49
search of some answers.


110

[MUSIC PLAYING]


111
0:5:34,436 --> 0:5:37,292
CHARLET DUBOC: We're backstage
at Colombia Moda.


112
0:5:37,292 --> 0:5:39,715
And the models are practicing.


113
0:5:39,715 --> 0:5:41,3
And they're really hot.


114
0:5:41,3 --> 0:5:45,202
But they don't look like
Colombian girls.

CHARLET DUBOC: Would you say
that this fashion week and


125
0:6:23,312 --> 0:6:26,623
models like you represent
the rest of Colombia?

CHARLET DUBOC: She didn't
like that question then.


129
0:6:33,23 --> 0:6:36,61
The term narco beauty seemed to
be as much to do with class


130
0:6:36,61 --> 0:6:39,21
as fashion.


131
0:6:39,21 --> 0:6:41,98
After the show, someone tipped
us off about a separate


132
0:6:41,98 --> 0:6:44,4
fashion event going on
across town called


133
0:6:44,4 --> 0:6:46,22
Moda para el Mundo.


134
0:6:46,22 --> 0:6:48,55
I wanted to find out the buzz
from some of the girls at


135
0:6:48,55 --> 0:6:49,45
Colombia Moda.


136
0:6:49,45 --> 0:6:52,438

fashion week, Para el Mundo?

like for people that--


142
0:7:8,374 --> 0:7:10,69
I don't want to say it.


143
0:7:10,69 --> 0:7:12,8
CHARLET DUBOC: The following day
we resolved to check out


144
0:7:12,8 --> 0:7:15,52
this other fashion week
to see for ourselves.


145
0:7:15,52 --> 0:7:17,855
So we've just arrived
in, like, a


146
0:7:17,855 --> 0:7:19,205
really fun area of town.


147
0:7:19,205 --> 0:7:21,9
I guess you'd call
it downtown.


148
0:7:21,9 --> 0:7:24,59
It's literally a stone's throw
from the actual, fashion week


149
0:7:24,59 --> 0:7:26,59
but it's worlds apart.


150
0:7:26,59 --> 0:7:30,6
It's called Moda para el Mundo,
Fashion for the World.


151
0:7:30,6 --> 0:7:32,96
And it's supposedly going
to represent more


152
0:7:32,96 --> 0:7:35,9
of Colombian fashion.


153
0:7:35,9 --> 0:7:45,7

CHARLET DUBOC: How do you feel
about the fact that the other


160
0:8:16,17 --> 0:8:19,17
fashion week, Colombia Moda,
they're slowly phasing out


161
0:8:19,17 --> 0:8:21,19
Colombian girls and
girls with curves?

CHARLET DUBOC: Although some
girls were natural, most


165
0:8:34,289 --> 0:8:37,669
definitely had some help to
achieve those curves.


166
0:8:37,669 --> 0:8:41,566

ubiquitous on the cat walk.

CHARLET DUBOC: It was unusual
for me to hear women's body


177
0:10:15,56 --> 0:10:19,22
parts referred to as bits,
comparable to accessories such


178
0:10:19,22 --> 0:10:20,47
as sunglasses.

said [INAUDIBLE].

He offered to give me the
Colombian model experience to


192
0:11:11,6 --> 0:11:14,18
gain some insight into Colombian
girls' motives and


193
0:11:14,18 --> 0:11:16,7
feelings about the way they
present themselves.

obviously nervous.

She's holding it together quite
well, unlike some of us.

to try and stay calm.

As soon as we feel a bit sick,
we have to leave immediately,

CHARLET DUBOC: Narco beauty is
clearly a dying aesthetic, a

hangover from a time that was,
in all seriousness, a fiercely

It's no surprise that the new

towards a more sleek,
European ideal.
