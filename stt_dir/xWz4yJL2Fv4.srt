0:0:14,23 --> 0:0:18,31
CHADD MCKEEN: In a time where
our economic stability is--


3
0:0:18,31 --> 0:0:19,12
it's in shambles.


4
0:0:19,12 --> 0:0:20,64
We're in trouble.


5
0:0:20,64 --> 0:0:23,45
And if we're not willing to
look at possible solutions


6
0:0:23,45 --> 0:0:26,89
outside the box, we're doomed.


7
0:0:26,89 --> 0:0:29,27
If money could grow on trees,
wouldn't we start growing


8
0:0:29,27 --> 0:0:30,87
those trees?


9
0:0:30,87 --> 0:0:32,12
Well.


10
0:0:32,12 --> 0:0:42,104

[MUSIC PLAYING]


12
0:0:53,42 --> 0:0:57,34
I really get a feeling
you can't imagine


13
0:0:57,34 --> 0:0:58,11
when you help somebody.


14
0:0:58,11 --> 0:1:0,15
You have somebody come
in here who's dying.


15
0:1:0,15 --> 0:1:2,98
And they say, hey man, I'm
dying, and they tell me I got


16
0:1:2,98 --> 0:1:5,9
x amount of months to live.


17
0:1:5,9 --> 0:1:6,81
I'm not even going to be
able to enjoy the last


18
0:1:6,81 --> 0:1:8,21
six months I have.


19
0:1:8,21 --> 0:1:9,59
And they say, I don't want
to take these pills.


20
0:1:9,59 --> 0:1:10,83
They make me constipated.


21
0:1:10,83 --> 0:1:11,515
I can't eat.


22
0:1:11,515 --> 0:1:13,46
I can't sleep.


23
0:1:13,46 --> 0:1:16,6
And to give them a medicine and
say, OK, you have what?


24
0:1:16,6 --> 0:1:18,5
OK, cool.


25
0:1:18,5 --> 0:1:19,37
This one.


26
0:1:19,37 --> 0:1:20,13
And you give that to them.


27
0:1:20,13 --> 0:1:21,96
And they come back
a week later.


28
0:1:21,96 --> 0:1:26,88
And they go, oh my god.


29
0:1:26,88 --> 0:1:28,81
You have no idea.


30
0:1:28,81 --> 0:1:30,66
I stopped taking all
my pain pills.


31
0:1:30,66 --> 0:1:33,16
I've stopped taking all
my insomnia pills.


32
0:1:33,16 --> 0:1:33,96
I stopped taking this.


33
0:1:33,96 --> 0:1:35,38
I stopped taking that.


34
0:1:35,38 --> 0:1:38,2
And that's incredibly
rewarding to me.


35
0:1:38,2 --> 0:1:41,45



36
0:1:41,45 --> 0:1:45,6
Medical marijuana is legal on
a state level in 17 states.


37
0:1:45,6 --> 0:1:48,81
It is illegal federally,
period.


38
0:1:48,81 --> 0:1:50,26
What this all originally
started out


39
0:1:50,26 --> 0:1:51,61
with was a great idea.


40
0:1:51,61 --> 0:1:57,13
Proposition 215 was basically
an idea that people who were


41
0:1:57,13 --> 0:2:3,47
dying from wasting and pain
issues, like cancer or AIDS,


42
0:2:3,47 --> 0:2:6,28
benefited greatly through
the use of cannabis.


43
0:2:6,28 --> 0:2:7,74
That's Prop 215.


44
0:2:7,74 --> 0:2:10,334
Now the problem with that is it
was written so vaguely, it


45
0:2:10,334 --> 0:2:14,77
was just a real simple, simple
piece of legislature.


46
0:2:14,77 --> 0:2:19,52
And it really got whored
out, so to speak.


47
0:2:19,52 --> 0:2:21,96
And people began to realize they
could take advantage of


48
0:2:21,96 --> 0:2:25,17
the looseness of the way this
was written and make it a


49
0:2:25,17 --> 0:2:28,64
profitable situation, people who
really didn't care about


50
0:2:28,64 --> 0:2:29,89
medical issues.


51
0:2:29,89 --> 0:2:35,6



52
0:2:35,6 --> 0:2:39,36
We decided to start Otherside
Farms out of selfish reasons,


53
0:2:39,36 --> 0:2:40,9
to be honest.


54
0:2:40,9 --> 0:2:44,36
I wanted to find a way to
cure my wife's cancer.


55
0:2:44,36 --> 0:2:47,72
My wife was fighting cancer,
and the chemo


56
0:2:47,72 --> 0:2:49,844
wasn't really working.


57
0:2:49,844 --> 0:2:51,82
Hi.


58
0:2:51,82 --> 0:2:57,15
And she actually saw firsthand
on one of her biopsy spots


59
0:2:57,15 --> 0:2:58,72
that it worked.


60
0:2:58,72 --> 0:3:2,22
I had some Rick Simpson oil, and
I put on a Bandaid, and I


61
0:3:2,22 --> 0:3:4,2
said let's put this on there.


62
0:3:4,2 --> 0:3:8,2
So I put this right there,
and in 36 hours--


63
0:3:8,2 --> 0:3:9,8
36 hours--


64
0:3:9,8 --> 0:3:13,13
it disappeared completely.


65
0:3:13,13 --> 0:3:14,28
This stuff works.


66
0:3:14,28 --> 0:3:17,6
It's irresponsible to not take
advantage of the situation.


67
0:3:17,6 --> 0:3:19,3
That's kind of weird, too,
because it's supposed to be


68
0:3:19,3 --> 0:3:21,25
95% Chocolate Thai.


69
0:3:21,25 --> 0:3:23,212
You'd think it would be
more of a prevalent.


70
0:3:23,212 --> 0:3:24,658
FEMALE SPEAKER: Smells
more melony to me.


71
0:3:24,658 --> 0:3:26,68
CHADD MCKEEN: Smells
super melony.


72
0:3:26,68 --> 0:3:29,17
Mm, smells so good.


73
0:3:29,17 --> 0:3:33,22
Now a letter went out from the
Department of Justice to all


74
0:3:33,22 --> 0:3:34,4
city attorneys.


75
0:3:34,4 --> 0:3:38,5
It basically says, if you
have someone that has


76
0:3:38,5 --> 0:3:40,97
1,000 plants or more--


77
0:3:40,97 --> 0:3:44,32
250 kilos, I think it is,
that's like 400 pounds.


78
0:3:44,32 --> 0:3:45,24
Crazy, dude.


79
0:3:45,24 --> 0:3:47,23
400 pounds, dude.


80
0:3:47,23 --> 0:3:49,76
If you have someone in your
city that you think falls


81
0:3:49,76 --> 0:3:52,2
within these parameters, let
us know and we'll come help


82
0:3:52,2 --> 0:3:57,5
you check them out, raid them,
and you know, the whole thing.


83
0:3:57,5 --> 0:4:0,34
6:00 in the morning on
January 17, I hear a


84
0:4:0,34 --> 0:4:1,57
pounding at my door.


85
0:4:1,57 --> 0:4:3,75
My wife ran downstairs, opened
the door for them, and said,


86
0:4:3,75 --> 0:4:5,55
hey, I've got a sick
child upstairs


87
0:4:5,55 --> 0:4:6,64
on a breathing machine.


88
0:4:6,64 --> 0:4:7,84
If you're going to shoot
me in the back,


89
0:4:7,84 --> 0:4:8,48
shoot me in the back.


90
0:4:8,48 --> 0:4:9,69
I'm going to go take
care of my kid.


91
0:4:9,69 --> 0:4:11,96
And so she ran back upstairs
to take care of Trevor.


92
0:4:11,96 --> 0:4:13,45
They stood at the door,
got my daughter


93
0:4:13,45 --> 0:4:14,56
out, put her in handcuffs.


94
0:4:14,56 --> 0:4:16,42
16-year-old.


95
0:4:16,42 --> 0:4:17,89
And I looked at him like, hey,
you didn't have to come in my


96
0:4:17,89 --> 0:4:19,14
house like this, man.


97
0:4:19,14 --> 0:4:22,3



98
0:4:22,3 --> 0:4:25,48
(IMITATING COP VOICE) Come
downstairs, sir.


99
0:4:25,48 --> 0:4:27,95
And I went down there, and they
threw me in handcuffs.


100
0:4:27,95 --> 0:4:30,16
So I gave them the combo to my
gun safe that's upstairs,


101
0:4:30,16 --> 0:4:34,24
where they found probably
a half a pound of shake.


102
0:4:34,24 --> 0:4:35,53
And that's all they got
out of our house.


103
0:4:35,53 --> 0:4:39,1
No guns, no other drugs, no huge
dashes of cash, no huge


104
0:4:39,1 --> 0:4:40,23
stash of marijuana.


105
0:4:40,23 --> 0:4:42,3
They took the keys to
our dispensary,


106
0:4:42,3 --> 0:4:43,8
opened everything up.


107
0:4:43,8 --> 0:4:45,85
And you know what they
got out of my store?


108
0:4:45,85 --> 0:4:47,255
Huge safe.


109
0:4:47,255 --> 0:4:49,95
They got it open.


110
0:4:49,95 --> 0:4:51,27
They open it up.


111
0:4:51,27 --> 0:4:54,12
One jar.


112
0:4:54,12 --> 0:4:57,2
And they killed a couple
hundred plants.


113
0:4:57,2 --> 0:5:0,34
They got me with ounces.


114
0:5:0,34 --> 0:5:2,67
They got me with a couple
hundred plants.


115
0:5:2,67 --> 0:5:3,74
I was stunned.


116
0:5:3,74 --> 0:5:5,97
I was absolutely stunned.


117
0:5:5,97 --> 0:5:8,99
So afraid they were going
to come again.


118
0:5:8,99 --> 0:5:10,46
Because they could come take
whatever they want.


119
0:5:10,46 --> 0:5:11,19
This is America.


120
0:5:11,19 --> 0:5:12,81
This is not supposed
to happen here.


121
0:5:12,81 --> 0:5:17,35
This is not supposed to
happen here, man.


122
0:5:17,35 --> 0:5:19,82
You see here, this is
our storage room.


123
0:5:19,82 --> 0:5:21,946
Every facility I have always has
a nice storage room where


124
0:5:21,946 --> 0:5:24,36
we keep stuff-- tools
and whatnot.


125
0:5:24,36 --> 0:5:27,95
The way things are in our
society today, we've gotta get


126
0:5:27,95 --> 0:5:29,2
kind of sneaky about things.


127
0:5:29,2 --> 0:5:33,37



128
0:5:33,37 --> 0:5:36,19
I got to go through this kind of
stuff, and risk my freedom


129
0:5:36,19 --> 0:5:40,31
like a superhero, to help
save people's lives.


130
0:5:40,31 --> 0:5:43,88
But I got to do what
I got to do.


131
0:5:43,88 --> 0:5:45,34
This room is being prepped.


132
0:5:45,34 --> 0:5:47,98
Those plants are all going
to come into this room.


133
0:5:47,98 --> 0:5:49,73
Every time that the plants
get taken out,


134
0:5:49,73 --> 0:5:50,39
this all gets cleaned.


135
0:5:50,39 --> 0:5:51,65
It's like a lab.


136
0:5:51,65 --> 0:5:56,197
So, this is cool.


137
0:5:56,197 --> 0:5:59,41
Shh, the babies are sleeping.


138
0:5:59,41 --> 0:6:1,666
We want to come in so the
light doesn't hit them.


139
0:6:1,666 --> 0:6:9,58



140
0:6:9,58 --> 0:6:11,93
You guys see how big these
fucking plants are?


141
0:6:11,93 --> 0:6:14,37
Things are massive, dude,
like a half pound


142
0:6:14,37 --> 0:6:17,665
each off these guys.


143
0:6:17,665 --> 0:6:20,73
In the state of California, it
used to be that you could have


144
0:6:20,73 --> 0:6:26,34
six mature plants or twelve
immature plants per patient.


145
0:6:26,34 --> 0:6:29,4
Well, then people started making
tinctures and started


146
0:6:29,4 --> 0:6:33,14
making the Rick Simpson oil,
where you need 16 pounds of


147
0:6:33,14 --> 0:6:35,1
quality marijuana to make
one ounce of this


148
0:6:35,1 --> 0:6:36,87
stuff that cures cancer.


149
0:6:36,87 --> 0:6:39,71
Now we've got a whole different
situation, because


150
0:6:39,71 --> 0:6:41,623
those six plants aren't going to
take care of the way I want


151
0:6:41,623 --> 0:6:43,25
to do my medicine.


152
0:6:43,25 --> 0:6:45,62
So California Supreme Court
said that you can't put


153
0:6:45,62 --> 0:6:47,57
limitations on a patient's
medicine.


154
0:6:47,57 --> 0:6:50,84
So now you can grow as many as
you can justify growing.


155
0:6:50,84 --> 0:6:53,82
We still went by the six
and twelve guideline.


156
0:6:53,82 --> 0:6:56,11
I wasn't going to push
the envelope.


157
0:6:56,11 --> 0:6:57,66
That's why our plant
count was down low.


158
0:6:57,66 --> 0:6:58,41
We grew trees.


159
0:6:58,41 --> 0:7:0,2
I waited and I had a system.


160
0:7:0,2 --> 0:7:1,87
That's why they're all in
different sized things.


161
0:7:1,87 --> 0:7:2,67
It's math here.


162
0:7:2,67 --> 0:7:4,1
This is all math.


163
0:7:4,1 --> 0:7:6,52
I've maximized every
square inch.


164
0:7:6,52 --> 0:7:8,6
I figured out how to tax this.


165
0:7:8,6 --> 0:7:9,36
I figured out how
to create jobs.


166
0:7:9,36 --> 0:7:11,31
Isn't that worthy of at
least a conversation?


167
0:7:11,31 --> 0:7:13,86
I mean, why do you kick the
door open of the man that


168
0:7:13,86 --> 0:7:17,4
invited you to his house?


169
0:7:17,4 --> 0:7:18,5
How do you raid that man?


170
0:7:18,5 --> 0:7:18,95
I don't understand.


171
0:7:18,95 --> 0:7:20,9
I was doing everything the way
you're supposed to do it.


172
0:7:20,9 --> 0:7:22,15
This shouldn't have
happened to me.


173
0:7:22,15 --> 0:7:27,17



174
0:7:27,17 --> 0:7:29,37
Hey, I'm going to keep
doing things my way.


175
0:7:29,37 --> 0:7:30,62
That's the bottom line.


176
0:7:30,62 --> 0:7:34,21



177
0:7:34,21 --> 0:7:37,66
You got to kill me if you want
me to stop helping people.


178
0:7:37,66 --> 0:7:39,53
Because I actually get off
on the fact that you


179
0:7:39,53 --> 0:7:40,78
want to stop me.


180
0:7:40,78 --> 0:9:40,78
