1
0:0:1,67 --> 0:0:2,368
Jesse Green: On this
episode of American Chainsaw.


2
0:0:2,368 --> 0:0:4,703
Grandma clown's got this water
squirting bit that she does,


3
0:0:4,703 --> 0:0:5,671
so that's what
we want to do.


4
0:0:5,671 --> 0:0:8,641
Keith: No bro.


5
0:0:8,641 --> 0:0:9,642
Oh, back it out.


6
0:0:9,642 --> 0:0:11,143
Jesse Green: No
(bleep) back it out.


7
0:0:11,143 --> 0:0:13,646
I want to scream and
just go back to bed.


8
0:0:13,646 --> 0:0:15,14
Don't drill into it bro.


9
0:0:15,14 --> 0:0:15,781
I hate it!


10
0:0:15,781 --> 0:0:16,682
Missi: It's
stressing me out!


11
0:0:16,682 --> 0:0:17,75
Jesse Green: Really?


12
0:0:17,75 --> 0:0:18,751
Missi: I don't know
what we're going to do.


13
0:0:18,751 --> 0:0:19,552
Jesse Green: We're
not going to make it!


14
0:0:19,552 --> 0:0:21,887
We're not going
to make it!


15
0:0:21,887 --> 0:0:24,23
I am "the Machine"
Jesse Green.


16
0:0:24,23 --> 0:0:25,791
A couple of years
ago I walked away


17
0:0:25,791 --> 0:0:27,359
from my job as
a truck driver,


18
0:0:27,359 --> 0:0:29,261
to chase my dream of
owning my own business


19
0:0:29,261 --> 0:0:31,97
as a master
chainsaw sculpter.


20
0:0:31,97 --> 0:0:32,598
I took a huge risk
in doing it,


21
0:0:32,598 --> 0:0:34,667
but the rewards of
being my own boss


22
0:0:34,667 --> 0:0:36,135
and doing exactly
what I want to do


23
0:0:36,135 --> 0:0:37,97
are so worth it to me.


24
0:0:37,97 --> 0:0:40,172
My employees,
including my own dad,


25
0:0:40,172 --> 0:0:42,408
drive me crazy.


26
0:0:42,408 --> 0:0:43,909
Get back!


27
0:0:43,909 --> 0:0:45,744
But I can't do this alone.


28
0:0:45,744 --> 0:0:47,146
I'm living my
dream and


29
0:0:47,146 --> 0:0:58,991
I wouldn't have
it any other way.


30
0:0:58,991 --> 0:1:2,428
All I know is, I like
Grandmas, I like clowns,


31
0:1:2,428 --> 0:1:5,131
so I'm thinking I'm gonna
like Grandma the Clown.


32
0:1:5,131 --> 0:1:6,966
My dad and I are on our
way now to go visit the


33
0:1:6,966 --> 0:1:10,169
Big Apple Circus, their
star Grandma the Clown,


34
0:1:10,169 --> 0:1:13,839
is retiring after 25
years and they want me


35
0:1:13,839 --> 0:1:15,875
to make a sculpture
commemorating her.


36
0:1:15,875 --> 0:1:17,61
Hundreds of
thousands of people,


37
0:1:17,61 --> 0:1:19,278
are going to see
this sculpture,


38
0:1:19,278 --> 0:1:21,48
this is a huge
opportunity for us.


39
0:1:21,48 --> 0:1:23,349
I only ask one thing of
you, alright, listen.


40
0:1:23,349 --> 0:1:24,183
Jay Green: What?


41
0:1:24,183 --> 0:1:25,84
Jesse Green:
Please don't talk.


42
0:1:25,84 --> 0:1:26,318
Jay Green: Is this
the speech again?


43
0:1:26,318 --> 0:1:27,953
Jesse Green: Just
stand there and smile


44
0:1:27,953 --> 0:1:29,522
and be cute.


45
0:1:29,522 --> 0:1:31,39
Just let me talk
to my clients.


46
0:1:31,39 --> 0:1:32,358
Jay Green: I mean if
they're talking to me,


47
0:1:32,358 --> 0:1:33,392
what can I do?


48
0:1:33,392 --> 0:1:34,593
Jesse Green: You can
exchange pleasantries,


49
0:1:34,593 --> 0:1:36,862
you know what I mean,
like, you can be cordial.


50
0:1:36,862 --> 0:1:38,697
You don't need to then
stand there while I'm


51
0:1:38,697 --> 0:1:40,9
trying to tell them
something and say,


52
0:1:40,9 --> 0:1:42,601
"Ah he's really good."


53
0:1:42,601 --> 0:1:44,203
Jay Green: I
wouldn't say that.


54
0:1:44,203 --> 0:1:45,4
Jesse Green:
You said that.


55
0:1:45,4 --> 0:1:45,671
Jay Green: I
never say that.


56
0:1:45,671 --> 0:1:46,739
Jesse Green: Every time.


57
0:1:46,739 --> 0:1:48,24
I don't, it's not that
I don't appreciate it,


58
0:1:48,24 --> 0:1:49,275
'cause I do.


59
0:1:49,275 --> 0:1:51,377
Jay Green: I think
Jesse is learning to be


60
0:1:51,377 --> 0:1:54,58
a good business man, but
he never lets me help him.


61
0:1:54,58 --> 0:1:56,749
He's treating me
like he's the father.


62
0:1:56,749 --> 0:1:58,15
Jesse Green: Just let
me talk to the clients.


63
0:1:58,15 --> 0:2:7,59
Jay Green:
Alright, maybe.


64
0:2:7,59 --> 0:2:8,127
Jesse Green: Hey!


65
0:2:8,127 --> 0:2:8,894
What up?


66
0:2:8,894 --> 0:2:9,962
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
Jesse.


67
0:2:9,962 --> 0:2:11,96
Jesse Green: Guillaume,
this is my dad, Jay.


68
0:2:11,96 --> 0:2:11,764
Jay Green: I understand
you wanted some kind of


69
0:2:11,764 --> 0:2:13,65
sculpture or something?


70
0:2:13,65 --> 0:2:14,5
Jesse Green: This is
my assistant Brett.


71
0:2:14,5 --> 0:2:16,468
Jay Green: What
can we do for you?


72
0:2:16,468 --> 0:2:17,469
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
Well, uh.


73
0:2:17,469 --> 0:2:18,47
Jesse Green: This is
my assistant Kerrin.


74
0:2:18,47 --> 0:2:19,505
Kerrin: Hi, Kerrin,
nice to meet you!


75
0:2:19,505 --> 0:2:20,606
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
Nice to meet you.


76
0:2:20,606 --> 0:2:22,274
Jay Green: I know Jesse
didn't want me to talk


77
0:2:22,274 --> 0:2:24,31
but I had to bust his
chops a little bit.


78
0:2:24,31 --> 0:2:25,344
Jesse Green: So my
wife Beth says you guys


79
0:2:25,344 --> 0:2:27,279
have a clown that's
retiring and


80
0:2:27,279 --> 0:2:29,348
you wanted a
sculpture, fill me in.


81
0:2:29,348 --> 0:2:30,449
Guillaume Dufresnoy: I
thought it would be great


82
0:2:30,449 --> 0:2:33,552
to have a piece by you
and if we could include


83
0:2:33,552 --> 0:2:36,222
something from a
clown gag, she does.


84
0:2:36,222 --> 0:2:37,256
Jesse Green: Guillaume
doesn't just want a


85
0:2:37,256 --> 0:2:38,424
sculpture of Grandma;


86
0:2:38,424 --> 0:2:40,25
he actually wants
a sculpture to do a


87
0:2:40,25 --> 0:2:41,427
trick from her act.


88
0:2:41,427 --> 0:2:43,462
This is not something
we normally do,


89
0:2:43,462 --> 0:2:45,531
but if we're gonna keep
growing our business we


90
0:2:45,531 --> 0:2:47,333
have to keep taking
on more complex and


91
0:2:47,333 --> 0:2:48,567
challenging projects.


92
0:2:48,567 --> 0:2:49,201
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
Alright let's go


93
0:2:49,201 --> 0:2:49,969
meet Grandma.


94
0:2:49,969 --> 0:2:50,502
Jesse Green:
Yeah, thanks.


95
0:2:50,502 --> 0:2:51,837
Alright.


96
0:2:51,837 --> 0:2:53,439
This is awesome, we're at
the Big Apple Circus.


97
0:2:53,439 --> 0:2:56,175
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
And this is Grandma.


98
0:2:56,175 --> 0:2:59,478
Jesse Green: Grandma
the Clown is a dude!


99
0:2:59,478 --> 0:3:2,348
To be honest, I was a
little thrown by that.


100
0:3:2,348 --> 0:3:3,916
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
And this is Jesse.


101
0:3:3,916 --> 0:3:5,517
Barry "Grandma": I've
heard nothing about you;


102
0:3:5,517 --> 0:3:7,152
it's an honor to meet me.


103
0:3:7,152 --> 0:3:8,22
Jesse Green: They tell
me they want me to


104
0:3:8,22 --> 0:3:9,788
immortalize you in wood,
you were interested in


105
0:3:9,788 --> 0:3:10,856
having it squirt water.


106
0:3:10,856 --> 0:3:11,924
Barry "Grandma": That
would be cool, yeah,


107
0:3:11,924 --> 0:3:13,259
yeah, yeah, you can
make that happen?


108
0:3:13,259 --> 0:3:14,159
Jesse Green: I can
make that happen if


109
0:3:14,159 --> 0:3:16,328
I can get you in
full Grandma get-up.


110
0:3:16,328 --> 0:3:17,263
All Grandma'd out.


111
0:3:17,263 --> 0:3:18,264
Barry "Grandma":
Yeah, of course.


112
0:3:18,264 --> 0:3:18,964
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
Okay guys,


113
0:3:18,964 --> 0:3:19,898
let's go into
the ring.


114
0:3:19,898 --> 0:3:20,699
Jesse Green: Alright.


115
0:3:20,699 --> 0:3:28,741
I thought it was
a girl, but yeah.


116
0:3:28,741 --> 0:3:38,317
Wow, should we
stand back?


117
0:3:38,317 --> 0:3:39,652
That is the most
talented thing I've


118
0:3:39,652 --> 0:3:41,2
ever seen in my life.


119
0:3:41,2 --> 0:3:42,354
Grandma did a lot of
funny stuff for us,


120
0:3:42,354 --> 0:3:43,856
but you know what,
the water squirting


121
0:3:43,856 --> 0:3:46,358
trick was definitely
the funniest part,


122
0:3:46,358 --> 0:3:47,826
this sculpture has
to squirt water.


123
0:3:47,826 --> 0:3:49,628
Now that I've seen
Grandma perform,


124
0:3:49,628 --> 0:3:51,13
I have a pretty good
idea of how we're


125
0:3:51,13 --> 0:3:52,364
gonna do this project.


126
0:3:52,364 --> 0:3:53,198
Barry "Grandma":
Have fun.


127
0:3:53,198 --> 0:3:54,166
Jesse Green:
We'll see you man.


128
0:3:54,166 --> 0:3:56,1
First we're gonna
need a fresh pine log.


129
0:3:56,1 --> 0:3:57,336
We're gonna shave
down the bark and


130
0:3:57,336 --> 0:3:59,371
cut out Grandma's
basic shape.


131
0:3:59,371 --> 0:4:2,74
Using a smaller saw I'll
cut in the fine details.


132
0:4:2,74 --> 0:4:3,809
And to finish up
we'll paint it and


133
0:4:3,809 --> 0:4:11,116
add in the water
squirting device.


134
0:4:11,116 --> 0:4:12,718
Are you guys ready for
another fun project?


135
0:4:12,718 --> 0:4:14,286
Missi: What have you
got for us this time?


136
0:4:14,286 --> 0:4:15,287
Jesse Green: The
Big Apple Circus.


137
0:4:15,287 --> 0:4:16,622
Before I start carving,


138
0:4:16,622 --> 0:4:18,924
I am meeting with my
finishers Missi and Keith.


139
0:4:18,924 --> 0:4:20,826
They're the ones that
will paint the finished


140
0:4:20,826 --> 0:4:23,429
sculpture and add on any
extra little details that


141
0:4:23,429 --> 0:4:24,496
the client might want.


142
0:4:24,496 --> 0:4:26,665
So Grandma clown's got
this water squirting bit


143
0:4:26,665 --> 0:4:28,4
that she does so that's
what we want to do.


144
0:4:28,4 --> 0:4:30,336
We want to make the
actual sculpture


145
0:4:30,336 --> 0:4:32,137
squirting water.


146
0:4:32,137 --> 0:4:32,671
Keith: Figures.


147
0:4:32,671 --> 0:4:34,239
Missi: What?


148
0:4:34,239 --> 0:4:35,207
Keith: The
impossible again.


149
0:4:35,207 --> 0:4:36,175
Missi: Squirt water?


150
0:4:36,175 --> 0:4:37,242
Jesse Green: Nothing
you can't handle.


151
0:4:37,242 --> 0:4:38,811
Missi: I'm used to crazy
deadlines around here.


152
0:4:38,811 --> 0:4:39,778
That doesn't bother me.


153
0:4:39,778 --> 0:4:41,13
I'm more worried
about doing things


154
0:4:41,13 --> 0:4:42,47
we've never done before.


155
0:4:42,47 --> 0:4:44,383
And we have never done
anything like this.


156
0:4:44,383 --> 0:4:45,617
This is definitely going
to be a challenge.


157
0:4:45,617 --> 0:4:46,685
Jesse Green: The
circus is only in town


158
0:4:46,685 --> 0:4:47,686
for a little while.


159
0:4:47,686 --> 0:4:48,854
Missi: How much time
do we have on this?


160
0:4:48,854 --> 0:4:53,292
Jesse Green: Ah,
a couple days.


161
0:4:53,292 --> 0:4:54,326
You can do it.


162
0:4:54,326 --> 0:4:55,6
Missi: All in two days?


163
0:4:55,6 --> 0:4:55,728
Jesse Green: Yeah.


164
0:4:55,728 --> 0:4:56,662
Missi: Oh my God.


165
0:4:56,662 --> 0:4:57,629
Jesse Green: Start
wrapping your head


166
0:4:57,629 --> 0:4:58,63
around the water
squirting thing because


167
0:4:58,63 --> 0:5:0,432
that's what's going
to sell this piece,


168
0:5:0,432 --> 0:5:0,999
you know what I mean.


169
0:5:0,999 --> 0:5:1,667
Keith: Stop talking.


170
0:5:1,667 --> 0:5:2,468
Go to work.


171
0:5:2,468 --> 0:5:3,1
Jesse Green:
Alright, I'm out.


172
0:5:3,1 --> 0:5:3,535
Keith: Alright.


173
0:5:3,535 --> 0:5:4,169
Missi: See ya.


174
0:5:4,169 --> 0:5:5,7
Kerrin: Alright, bye.


175
0:5:5,7 --> 0:5:6,271
Keith: Alright.


176
0:5:6,271 --> 0:5:8,207
Missi: Oh my God.


177
0:5:8,207 --> 0:5:10,442
Jesse Green: Oh God,
I'm gonna carve you!


178
0:5:10,442 --> 0:5:12,711
Let's do it.


179
0:5:12,711 --> 0:5:15,147
Now it's time for me to
start carving out Grandma,


180
0:5:15,147 --> 0:5:16,782
this is literally
the part of the job


181
0:5:16,782 --> 0:5:26,291
that I live for.


182
0:5:26,291 --> 0:5:27,96
Jay Green: That
makes me cringe.


183
0:5:27,96 --> 0:5:29,561
I know what
the saw can do.


184
0:5:29,561 --> 0:5:31,597
His mother would
kill me if I ever


185
0:5:31,597 --> 0:5:34,633
let anything
happen to him.


186
0:5:34,633 --> 0:5:37,269
Jesse Green: What I do
is wicked dangerous.


187
0:5:37,269 --> 0:5:39,171
Chainsaws are
wicked dangerous.


188
0:5:39,171 --> 0:5:41,39
Over 30,000 people
every year are


189
0:5:41,39 --> 0:5:42,174
injured by chainsaws.


190
0:5:42,174 --> 0:5:43,475
Every moment of
every second that


191
0:5:43,475 --> 0:5:45,844
I'm carving I have to
think about safety.


192
0:5:45,844 --> 0:5:47,579
I have to think about
keeping myself from


193
0:5:47,579 --> 0:5:49,882
letting that chain
cutting my face off.


194
0:5:49,882 --> 0:5:59,124
But I love it.


195
0:5:59,124 --> 0:6:0,592
Missi: I have a feeling
that a pickup truck is


196
0:6:0,592 --> 0:6:2,227
going to work best,
because it's gonna give us


197
0:6:2,227 --> 0:6:3,328
more room to maneuver.


198
0:6:3,328 --> 0:6:5,23
Keith: We have next to no
budget to make Grandma


199
0:6:5,23 --> 0:6:7,699
squirt, so we're at the
junkyard to get some


200
0:6:7,699 --> 0:6:9,668
windshield washer parts.


201
0:6:9,668 --> 0:6:12,37
If we don't get this
project to work right


202
0:6:12,37 --> 0:6:13,739
Jesse's gonna blame us.


203
0:6:13,739 --> 0:6:15,774
And that just sucks.


204
0:6:15,774 --> 0:6:17,743
I'm not seeing
what we need.


205
0:6:17,743 --> 0:6:18,577
Nope.


206
0:6:18,577 --> 0:6:20,45
Looks like it's
already gone.


207
0:6:20,45 --> 0:6:20,879
Ah.


208
0:6:20,879 --> 0:6:21,947
Missi: That's
not gonna work.


209
0:6:21,947 --> 0:6:23,115
We've gotta go smaller.


210
0:6:23,115 --> 0:6:29,154
Keith: Too big, that's
actually an alright size.


211
0:6:29,154 --> 0:6:32,124
There we go and
there we go.


212
0:6:32,124 --> 0:6:33,192
We got our button.


213
0:6:33,192 --> 0:6:34,293
We found the pump.


214
0:6:34,293 --> 0:6:36,28
Now we have to take it
back and test it out to


215
0:6:36,28 --> 0:6:37,396
see if it works.


216
0:6:37,396 --> 0:6:37,93
Missi: Good job.


217
0:6:37,93 --> 0:6:45,604
Keith: Awesome.


218
0:6:45,604 --> 0:6:46,638
Beth Green:
Looks awesome.


219
0:6:46,638 --> 0:6:47,773
Jesse Green: My
wife Beth runs the


220
0:6:47,773 --> 0:6:48,874
day to day business.


221
0:6:48,874 --> 0:6:50,909
She's the glue that
keeps whole thing going.


222
0:6:50,909 --> 0:6:52,1
She keeps the
business running;


223
0:6:52,1 --> 0:6:54,12
she collects the money,
talks to the clients.


224
0:6:54,12 --> 0:6:55,28
There's no possible
way I can do any of


225
0:6:55,28 --> 0:6:56,348
this without her.


226
0:6:56,348 --> 0:6:57,616
Beth Green: So Guillaume
from Big Apple Circus


227
0:6:57,616 --> 0:6:59,251
just called and he
wants you to deliver


228
0:6:59,251 --> 0:7:1,86
this opening night.


229
0:7:1,86 --> 0:7:4,56
But you're going to do it
in front of 1,500 people.


230
0:7:4,56 --> 0:7:5,123
Jesse Green:
Like literally


231
0:7:5,123 --> 0:7:6,291
during the circus?


232
0:7:6,291 --> 0:7:7,493
Beth Green: So basically
you can't be late.


233
0:7:7,493 --> 0:7:8,961
If you're not there
at the beginning of the


234
0:7:8,961 --> 0:7:11,964
circus 1500 kids
will be crying.


235
0:7:11,964 --> 0:7:12,931
Jesse Green: I've
delivered in front of


236
0:7:12,931 --> 0:7:15,133
crowds before but
it's going to be scary


237
0:7:15,133 --> 0:7:17,936
standing there in
front of 1500 people.


238
0:7:17,936 --> 0:7:19,671
This thing's got to
work perfectly or


239
0:7:19,671 --> 0:7:21,73
I'm going to
look like a fool.


240
0:7:21,73 --> 0:7:22,774
Don't put that on me.


241
0:7:22,774 --> 0:7:23,976
Dude, don't
put that on me.


242
0:7:23,976 --> 0:7:24,743
Beth Green: You
can spit it out.


243
0:7:24,743 --> 0:7:25,744
It's gonna be awesome.


244
0:7:25,744 --> 0:7:26,478
Jesse Green: No I can't
just spit it out.


245
0:7:26,478 --> 0:7:27,479
Beth Green: Yes you can.


246
0:7:27,479 --> 0:7:28,881
Jesse Green: No, I
don't like deadlines.


247
0:7:28,881 --> 0:7:30,115
You tell me now
that I have to


248
0:7:30,115 --> 0:7:31,483
do it to the minute?


249
0:7:31,483 --> 0:7:32,718
Beth Green: You're
wasting minutes now.


250
0:7:32,718 --> 0:7:34,119
So if you put
those minutes


251
0:7:34,119 --> 0:7:35,354
towards that sculpture.


252
0:7:35,354 --> 0:7:36,188
I'm sincerely worried.


253
0:7:36,188 --> 0:7:37,99
Jesse is horrible
with deadlines.


254
0:7:37,99 --> 0:7:40,92
I'm not trying to be a nag
but we need him to deliver


255
0:7:40,92 --> 0:7:42,861
this project on time
because we need the money.


256
0:7:42,861 --> 0:7:44,363
I know I stress him
out by pushing him but


257
0:7:44,363 --> 0:7:46,131
that's the only
way we get it done.


258
0:7:46,131 --> 0:7:47,299
I just need you
to get it done.


259
0:7:47,299 --> 0:7:48,767
Jay Green: Jesse
never did well with


260
0:7:48,767 --> 0:7:51,69
any kind of deadlines
and that's why Beth


261
0:7:51,69 --> 0:7:53,438
takes over the daily
business part.


262
0:7:53,438 --> 0:7:54,84
Jesse, he's an artist.


263
0:7:54,84 --> 0:7:56,842
Jesse Green: I'm,
we're well underway.


264
0:7:56,842 --> 0:7:57,709
Beth Green: Good job.


265
0:7:57,709 --> 0:7:59,44
Jesse Green: Thank
you very much.


266
0:7:59,44 --> 0:8:0,12
Brett: I want to
go to the circus!


267
0:8:0,12 --> 0:8:23,335
Jesse Green: No!


268
0:8:23,335 --> 0:8:25,47
I forgot the glasses.


269
0:8:25,47 --> 0:8:28,24
I forgot the glasses.


270
0:8:28,24 --> 0:8:29,575
I made a huge mistake.


271
0:8:29,575 --> 0:8:30,776
I (bleep) up.


272
0:8:30,776 --> 0:8:33,78
I cut off any part that
I could have used on


273
0:8:33,78 --> 0:8:35,47
Grandma's face to
make glasses with.


274
0:8:35,47 --> 0:8:37,282
It's just a stupid
rookie mistake and


275
0:8:37,282 --> 0:8:46,758
now I don't know what
the (bleep) I'm gonna do.


276
0:8:46,758 --> 0:8:48,293
Jesse Green: I made
a huge mistake.


277
0:8:48,293 --> 0:8:51,196
I cannot believe I forgot
Grandma's glasses.


278
0:8:51,196 --> 0:8:53,799
It's not gonna be an
easy fix but I'm gonna


279
0:8:53,799 --> 0:8:55,67
have to figure
something out.


280
0:8:55,67 --> 0:8:55,601
Beth Green: Hey!


281
0:8:55,601 --> 0:8:56,602
How's it going?


282
0:8:56,602 --> 0:8:58,36
Jesse Green: I forgot
Grandma's glasses.


283
0:8:58,36 --> 0:8:59,71
See.


284
0:8:59,71 --> 0:9:1,206
Beth Green: Oh, do you
have to start over?


285
0:9:1,206 --> 0:9:2,374
Jesse Green: I
can't start over.


286
0:9:2,374 --> 0:9:3,75
Beth Green: Well
how are you gonna


287
0:9:3,75 --> 0:9:4,42
fit the glasses in?


288
0:9:4,42 --> 0:9:4,876
Jesse Green: I can
cut away from here.


289
0:9:4,876 --> 0:9:6,578
I can round these
cheeks down.


290
0:9:6,578 --> 0:9:8,38
I can pull
the mouth back.


291
0:9:8,38 --> 0:9:9,681
Flatten, flatten.


292
0:9:9,681 --> 0:9:10,983
Beth Green: Are you
gonna stay on schedule?


293
0:9:10,983 --> 0:9:11,984
That's all I care.


294
0:9:11,984 --> 0:9:12,718
Jesse Green: What
choice do I have?


295
0:9:12,718 --> 0:9:13,585
Beth Green: You don't.


296
0:9:13,585 --> 0:9:14,219
Jesse Green: It's
gonna get done.


297
0:9:14,219 --> 0:9:14,886
It's gonna get fixed.


298
0:9:14,886 --> 0:9:15,954
I'm gonna do the glasses.


299
0:9:15,954 --> 0:9:16,755
Beth Green: Alright.


300
0:9:16,755 --> 0:9:17,856
I'm gonna go make
banana bread.


301
0:9:17,856 --> 0:9:20,192
Jesse Green: Oh
that sounds good.


302
0:9:20,192 --> 0:9:21,93
Yeah, with the
chocolate chips


303
0:9:21,93 --> 0:9:25,297
and the, and the nuts.


304
0:9:25,297 --> 0:9:26,965
I got the glasses
figured out.


305
0:9:26,965 --> 0:9:29,301
Solution, push the
whole thing back.


306
0:9:29,301 --> 0:9:31,236
You don't just cut one
thing you cut 28 things.


307
0:9:31,236 --> 0:9:33,705
I squared it and
voilà we are fixed


308
0:9:33,705 --> 0:9:43,415
and all will be
right with the world.


309
0:9:43,415 --> 0:9:47,252
Kills after a while.


310
0:9:47,252 --> 0:9:48,286
What's happening?


311
0:9:48,286 --> 0:9:49,54
Missi: I think we have
your water feature.


312
0:9:49,54 --> 0:9:49,855
Do you want to see 'em?


313
0:9:49,855 --> 0:9:50,789
Jesse Green: Yea.


314
0:9:50,789 --> 0:9:51,757
Missi: I think you'll
be impressed.


315
0:9:51,757 --> 0:9:52,724
Keith: For the Grandma
sculpture Jesse


316
0:9:52,724 --> 0:9:55,27
wants to project water
out of its mouth.


317
0:9:55,27 --> 0:9:57,95
We've come up with some
solutions to the problem.


318
0:9:57,95 --> 0:9:59,31
Missi: So now our
job is to talk


319
0:9:59,31 --> 0:10:0,699
Jesse into using it.


320
0:10:0,699 --> 0:10:2,367
Otherwise we'll have
to start from scratch


321
0:10:2,367 --> 0:10:3,935
and I don't
want to do that.


322
0:10:3,935 --> 0:10:4,903
Jesse Green: Is this
going to self destruct


323
0:10:4,903 --> 0:10:5,771
in like 30
seconds or what?


324
0:10:5,771 --> 0:10:8,106
Missi: No actually
it's like a pump.


325
0:10:8,106 --> 0:10:10,876
Jesse Green:
Let's see it.


326
0:10:10,876 --> 0:10:13,445
Ooh, look at the flow!


327
0:10:13,445 --> 0:10:14,212
Missi: This could work.


328
0:10:14,212 --> 0:10:15,847
It's up to you
ultimately.


329
0:10:15,847 --> 0:10:16,882
Jesse Green: I don't know.


330
0:10:16,882 --> 0:10:18,65
I don't think something
with that many parts


331
0:10:18,65 --> 0:10:19,718
is the most practical.


332
0:10:19,718 --> 0:10:20,686
Keith: This works!


333
0:10:20,686 --> 0:10:22,87
And Grandma
shooting her water.


334
0:10:22,87 --> 0:10:23,255
It's the same thing.


335
0:10:23,255 --> 0:10:24,122
Jesse Green: Yeah, but.


336
0:10:24,122 --> 0:10:25,257
Missi: And you
want it realistic.


337
0:10:25,257 --> 0:10:26,692
Jesse Green: It's cool,
but it's a big battery.


338
0:10:26,692 --> 0:10:28,794
And I don't know if
it's gonna be practical


339
0:10:28,794 --> 0:10:30,228
to send down the
line with these guys.


340
0:10:30,228 --> 0:10:31,463
Can we set it up
with maybe just a


341
0:10:31,463 --> 0:10:33,198
bunch of AA
batteries instead?


342
0:10:33,198 --> 0:10:34,366
Keith: No bro.


343
0:10:34,366 --> 0:10:35,467
With a smaller
battery it's going to


344
0:10:35,467 --> 0:10:37,469
look like she's
spittin' up on herself.


345
0:10:37,469 --> 0:10:38,67
Jesse Green: I
think that Keith and


346
0:10:38,67 --> 0:10:40,372
Missi's windshield washer
solution is too complex


347
0:10:40,372 --> 0:10:43,41
but I have to trust them.


348
0:10:43,41 --> 0:10:44,576
It's what I pay them for;


349
0:10:44,576 --> 0:10:46,645
I just hope that I don't
end up regretting this.


350
0:10:46,645 --> 0:10:47,746
Just tell me
you guys guarantee


351
0:10:47,746 --> 0:10:48,747
it's gonna work.


352
0:10:48,747 --> 0:10:49,481
Missi: I won't
let you down.


353
0:10:49,481 --> 0:10:50,816
Neither will Keith.


354
0:10:50,816 --> 0:10:52,217
Jesse Green: Alright, I'm
going back to carving.


355
0:10:52,217 --> 0:10:56,888
Keith: Alright, big boy.


356
0:10:56,888 --> 0:10:57,689
Jesse Green: The
fine cut is the thing


357
0:10:57,689 --> 0:10:58,857
that makes it
or breaks it.


358
0:10:58,857 --> 0:11:0,559
It doesn't look
like Grandma until


359
0:11:0,559 --> 0:11:1,993
I get the
detail in there.


360
0:11:1,993 --> 0:11:3,462
Just kind of
delicately touch it.


361
0:11:3,462 --> 0:11:5,3
Just a little touch
makes all the difference


362
0:11:5,3 --> 0:11:11,336
in the world.


363
0:11:11,336 --> 0:11:12,137
What do you think?


364
0:11:12,137 --> 0:11:14,806
Jay Green: Looks
like (bleep).


365
0:11:14,806 --> 0:11:15,707
Jesse Green: I'm
done carving and


366
0:11:15,707 --> 0:11:16,908
now it's time
for finishing.


367
0:11:16,908 --> 0:11:18,21
We are not out
of the woods yet.


368
0:11:18,21 --> 0:11:19,544
It can go literally
straight out the


369
0:11:19,544 --> 0:11:20,245
back of her neck.


370
0:11:20,245 --> 0:11:20,746
Jay Green: No, it can't.


371
0:11:20,746 --> 0:11:21,813
Jesse Green: Why?


372
0:11:21,813 --> 0:11:23,582
Keith: Because the water
will go straight down.


373
0:11:23,582 --> 0:11:25,617
We want it to shoot
at a projectile up.


374
0:11:25,617 --> 0:11:26,718
Jesse Green: Oh.


375
0:11:26,718 --> 0:11:28,153
To make this
chainsaw sculpture


376
0:11:28,153 --> 0:11:30,355
squirt water we're gonna
have to drill 2 holes


377
0:11:30,355 --> 0:11:32,657
for a water tube, one
in Grandma's mouth


378
0:11:32,657 --> 0:11:34,626
and the other
in her hand.


379
0:11:34,626 --> 0:11:37,162
Jay Green: Once you start
it, it's gonna be fine.


380
0:11:37,162 --> 0:11:38,463
Jesse Green: Why is it
jumping around like that?


381
0:11:38,463 --> 0:11:39,731
Jay Green: Just drill it!


382
0:11:39,731 --> 0:11:40,499
Jesse Green: I want
to know why it's


383
0:11:40,499 --> 0:11:41,633
jumping around like that!


384
0:11:41,633 --> 0:11:43,34
Jay Green:
Because it's long!


385
0:11:43,34 --> 0:11:43,869
Don't worry about it.


386
0:11:43,869 --> 0:11:44,803
Do it again,
do it again.


387
0:11:44,803 --> 0:11:46,171
Jay Green: I wish
Jesse would just


388
0:11:46,171 --> 0:11:47,339
listen to me sometimes.


389
0:11:47,339 --> 0:11:51,91
Keith: Down,
down a little.


390
0:11:51,91 --> 0:11:53,78
Beautiful!


391
0:11:53,78 --> 0:11:54,412
Jesse Green: Success dude.


392
0:11:54,412 --> 0:11:58,16
To hit that exact spot
out the back is not luck.


393
0:11:58,16 --> 0:11:59,584
Sometimes I even
impress myself.


394
0:11:59,584 --> 0:12:0,585
Jay Green: Do you
want the ruler again?


395
0:12:0,585 --> 0:12:1,62
Jesse Green: No, I'm
just going to drill


396
0:12:1,62 --> 0:12:2,32
from the side sight.


397
0:12:2,32 --> 0:12:2,988
I can see.


398
0:12:2,988 --> 0:12:6,424
Jay Green: Oh!


399
0:12:6,424 --> 0:12:7,225
Jesse Green: Son of a.


400
0:12:7,225 --> 0:12:7,993
Jay Green: Oh!


401
0:12:7,993 --> 0:12:8,927
Back it out.


402
0:12:8,927 --> 0:12:10,95
Jesse Green: No
(bleep) back it out!


403
0:12:10,95 --> 0:12:11,263
That drill bit was
supposed to go through


404
0:12:11,263 --> 0:12:13,999
the hand and the next
thing I know the drill


405
0:12:13,999 --> 0:12:16,168
bit was coming out
of Grandma's hip.


406
0:12:16,168 --> 0:12:19,271
Hip surgery is not what I
had planned for Grandma.


407
0:12:19,271 --> 0:12:22,741
What the (bleep)!


408
0:12:22,741 --> 0:12:24,843
I could not be more
beside myself right now.


409
0:12:24,843 --> 0:12:28,68
I want to scream and cry
and just go back to bed.


410
0:12:28,68 --> 0:12:29,748
Jay Green: We can fix it.


411
0:12:29,748 --> 0:12:31,416
All you have to do is
fill this a little bit.


412
0:12:31,416 --> 0:12:32,651
Turn this at an angle.


413
0:12:32,651 --> 0:12:33,919
It's, it's fine.


414
0:12:33,919 --> 0:12:34,686
Relax.


415
0:12:34,686 --> 0:12:36,922
Jesse sometimes
over-reacts.


416
0:12:36,922 --> 0:12:41,326
If he just calms down he'd
realize it's not that bad.


417
0:12:41,326 --> 0:12:42,627
Jesse Green: My dad
is very quick to


418
0:12:42,627 --> 0:12:43,929
say it's no big deal.


419
0:12:43,929 --> 0:12:45,163
It's a big (bleep) deal!


420
0:12:45,163 --> 0:12:46,665
One more thing to fix!


421
0:12:46,665 --> 0:12:47,699
What's next?


422
0:12:47,699 --> 0:12:49,301
Let me ask you
that, what's next?


423
0:12:49,301 --> 0:12:50,335
Missi: Hey!


424
0:12:50,335 --> 0:12:51,77
Jesse Green: Hey,
question for you.


425
0:12:51,77 --> 0:12:54,372
Do you think I need to put
the black glass eyes in?


426
0:12:54,372 --> 0:12:55,24
Missi: I don't
know but it needs


427
0:12:55,24 --> 0:12:56,842
a bridge of the
nose, doesn't it?


428
0:12:56,842 --> 0:12:59,344
Kerrin: Yeah.


429
0:12:59,344 --> 0:13:1,213
Jesse Green: I straight up
left something right out.


430
0:13:1,213 --> 0:13:2,948
The bridge nose piece,


431
0:13:2,948 --> 0:13:4,115
yeah I left that off.


432
0:13:4,115 --> 0:13:5,65
(Bleep).


433
0:13:5,65 --> 0:13:7,352
How the (bleep) am
I gonna do that?


434
0:13:7,352 --> 0:13:8,92
Do you think I need
an eye piece that bad?


435
0:13:8,92 --> 0:13:10,622
Missi: I noticed it
but I notice details.


436
0:13:10,622 --> 0:13:11,823
Sorry.


437
0:13:11,823 --> 0:13:13,458
Jesse Green: Missi is a
little too good at details,


438
0:13:13,458 --> 0:13:16,261
she makes me feel
like I suck at details.


439
0:13:16,261 --> 0:13:18,597
But she's right and
now I have to fix it.


440
0:13:18,597 --> 0:13:21,399
That is such a small area.


441
0:13:21,399 --> 0:13:22,634
I think it's
gonna look funny.


442
0:13:22,634 --> 0:13:23,835
I have a deadline.


443
0:13:23,835 --> 0:13:25,27
This is the
second time now;


444
0:13:25,27 --> 0:13:26,838
I've screwed up
on the glasses.


445
0:13:26,838 --> 0:13:28,406
I gotta figure
out what to do.


446
0:13:28,406 --> 0:13:30,475
I'm just gonna come
back to it later.


447
0:13:30,475 --> 0:13:32,811
Finish this off, will ya?


448
0:13:32,811 --> 0:13:35,28
What a nightmare.


449
0:13:35,28 --> 0:13:37,182
Keith: Jesse's make a
big deal about Grandma's


450
0:13:37,182 --> 0:13:40,51
glasses, but I came
up with an easy fix.


451
0:13:40,51 --> 0:13:42,153
Missi and I thought we
could bend a piece of wire


452
0:13:42,153 --> 0:13:44,89
across to form the
bridge of the glasses.


453
0:13:44,89 --> 0:13:46,992
So after I primed the
sculpture Missi went


454
0:13:46,992 --> 0:13:48,994
ahead and installed
the bridge.


455
0:13:48,994 --> 0:13:50,228
Problem solved.


456
0:13:50,228 --> 0:13:52,297
We think Jesse's
gonna love it.


457
0:13:52,297 --> 0:13:54,599
Jesse Green: What
the hell is this?


458
0:13:54,599 --> 0:13:55,567
Missi: Are you
being serious?


459
0:13:55,567 --> 0:13:56,768
Jesse Green: No, yes
I'm being serious.


460
0:13:56,768 --> 0:13:58,169
First of all, I can't
believe you just


461
0:13:58,169 --> 0:14:0,472
straight out drilled
holes without (bleep).


462
0:14:0,472 --> 0:14:1,74
Keith: I really
didn't go deep,


463
0:14:1,74 --> 0:14:2,807
we can sand that away.


464
0:14:2,807 --> 0:14:4,576
Jesse Green: Don't
drill a hole before


465
0:14:4,576 --> 0:14:5,844
you talk to me
about it, dude!


466
0:14:5,844 --> 0:14:7,212
The carving is done,
like don't dig into it,


467
0:14:7,212 --> 0:14:9,381
don't drill into it, bro.


468
0:14:9,381 --> 0:14:12,55
If you really are looking
to piss me off go ahead


469
0:14:12,55 --> 0:14:14,586
and drill holes in my
finished sculpture.


470
0:14:14,586 --> 0:14:16,321
Not only did Keith and
Missi do that but the


471
0:14:16,321 --> 0:14:18,623
metal piece they stuck
in there for a bridge,


472
0:14:18,623 --> 0:14:19,824
looks like (bleep).


473
0:14:19,824 --> 0:14:20,892
It looks random though.


474
0:14:20,892 --> 0:14:21,927
You see what I'm saying?


475
0:14:21,927 --> 0:14:22,894
Missi: What if you had
this metal here and


476
0:14:22,894 --> 0:14:24,262
you had another piece
of the same metal


477
0:14:24,262 --> 0:14:25,964
coming around here.


478
0:14:25,964 --> 0:14:27,265
Jesse Green: It doesn't
even match the color.


479
0:14:27,265 --> 0:14:28,533
She has silver things.


480
0:14:28,533 --> 0:14:29,501
You know what
I mean, like.


481
0:14:29,501 --> 0:14:30,769
Missi: It can be painted.


482
0:14:30,769 --> 0:14:31,803
Jesse Green: I hate it.


483
0:14:31,803 --> 0:14:33,371
Keith: Jesse came in
and I was expecting a


484
0:14:33,371 --> 0:14:36,241
high five and a yeah
bro but he basically


485
0:14:36,241 --> 0:14:38,443
crapped on the whole idea.


486
0:14:38,443 --> 0:14:40,345
It puts us back
at square one.


487
0:14:40,345 --> 0:14:41,613
Jesse Green: It
has to be perfect.


488
0:14:41,613 --> 0:14:42,681
I'm not ticked off.


489
0:14:42,681 --> 0:14:43,448
Missi: You're something.


490
0:14:43,448 --> 0:14:44,449
What's the other
word for it?


491
0:14:44,449 --> 0:14:45,717
Jesse Green: Picky.


492
0:14:45,717 --> 0:14:47,953
Don't fill in the holes
yet, just paint it.


493
0:14:47,953 --> 0:14:49,354
Leave this the
(bleep) off.


494
0:14:49,354 --> 0:14:50,622
We'll figure
it out later.


495
0:14:50,622 --> 0:14:57,62
Missi: Okay.


496
0:14:57,62 --> 0:14:57,996
Jesse Green: If it
looks uneven anywhere,


497
0:14:57,996 --> 0:14:59,464
I'm just gonna
be like this,


498
0:14:59,464 --> 0:15:1,32
you know what I mean.


499
0:15:1,32 --> 0:15:2,233
Missi: Jesse is a bit
of a control freak.


500
0:15:2,233 --> 0:15:4,936
Jesse Green: I see a
couple spots to fix.


501
0:15:4,936 --> 0:15:6,171
Missi: He's the type of
artist that likes to


502
0:15:6,171 --> 0:15:8,373
have his hands on every
aspect of a project.


503
0:15:8,373 --> 0:15:9,174
Jesse Green: It's a
chainsaw sculpture


504
0:15:9,174 --> 0:15:10,308
so it's got to be perfect.


505
0:15:10,308 --> 0:15:12,77
Missi: If Jesse would
leave us alone and just


506
0:15:12,77 --> 0:15:13,945
concentrate a little
bit more on carving,


507
0:15:13,945 --> 0:15:16,114
instead of painting, we
could get a lot more done.


508
0:15:16,114 --> 0:15:17,549
Jesse Green: Are you
gonna fix this now.


509
0:15:17,549 --> 0:15:19,117
Missi: Yeah, it still
needs the touch up, so.


510
0:15:19,117 --> 0:15:20,652
Jesse Green: And
this and this.


511
0:15:20,652 --> 0:15:22,153
Missi: I'll
touch it up.


512
0:15:22,153 --> 0:15:23,54
This needs a
second coat.


513
0:15:23,54 --> 0:15:26,491
Jesse Green: And
this and that.


514
0:15:26,491 --> 0:15:27,425
Missi: You're
stressing me out!


515
0:15:27,425 --> 0:15:28,393
Knock it off!


516
0:15:28,393 --> 0:15:30,495
Oh my God, Jesse
you're so controlling.


517
0:15:30,495 --> 0:15:32,33
Enough already!


518
0:15:32,33 --> 0:15:34,366
Keith: Ah, perfect!


519
0:15:34,366 --> 0:15:35,66
We're through.


520
0:15:35,66 --> 0:15:36,1
After we finished painting


521
0:15:36,1 --> 0:15:37,302
it was time to get
the water pump and


522
0:15:37,302 --> 0:15:39,4
the tubing installed
in order to make


523
0:15:39,4 --> 0:15:40,205
Grandma squirt.


524
0:15:40,205 --> 0:15:41,873
We should probably
test it, you think?


525
0:15:41,873 --> 0:15:43,308
Missi: Absolutely,
test it.


526
0:15:43,308 --> 0:15:45,43
Keith: Alright,
are you ready?


527
0:15:45,43 --> 0:15:48,68
Missi: Careful.


528
0:15:48,68 --> 0:15:49,581
Wow!


529
0:15:49,581 --> 0:15:50,749
That goes far.


530
0:15:50,749 --> 0:15:51,983
Keith: Oh, that's a
nice little squirt.


531
0:15:51,983 --> 0:15:59,224
Missi: It's better
than like I expected.


532
0:15:59,224 --> 0:16:0,725
Beth Green: It takes like
an hour to get there.


533
0:16:0,725 --> 0:16:1,693
Jesse Green: I know, Beth.


534
0:16:1,693 --> 0:16:2,494
Beth Green: We
need to wrap it up!


535
0:16:2,494 --> 0:16:3,495
Are you guys
almost ready?


536
0:16:3,495 --> 0:16:4,429
Five minutes.


537
0:16:4,429 --> 0:16:5,363
Jesse Green: We are
working as hard


538
0:16:5,363 --> 0:16:6,297
and as fast as we can.


539
0:16:6,297 --> 0:16:7,432
Beth Green: It's deliver
or starve today.


540
0:16:7,432 --> 0:16:9,534
Jesse Green: Get out
the way so I can finish.


541
0:16:9,534 --> 0:16:10,668
I'm begging you.


542
0:16:10,668 --> 0:16:12,27
Beth Green: If he doesn't
deliver this on time


543
0:16:12,27 --> 0:16:13,571
we may not get paid.


544
0:16:13,571 --> 0:16:14,873
We really need
the money.


545
0:16:14,873 --> 0:16:16,374
If I can keep
him on track,


546
0:16:16,374 --> 0:16:17,342
I'm really just
looking out


547
0:16:17,342 --> 0:16:18,843
for our best interest.


548
0:16:18,843 --> 0:16:20,612
Missi: I know you didn't
like the bridge idea made


549
0:16:20,612 --> 0:16:25,316
out of metal but I painted
a couple the same color as


550
0:16:25,316 --> 0:16:27,118
the frame of the glasses.


551
0:16:27,118 --> 0:16:28,82
Does that look better?


552
0:16:28,82 --> 0:16:32,357
Jesse Green: Aww, that
makes a big difference.


553
0:16:32,357 --> 0:16:33,591
Missi: And it doesn't
stand out too much,


554
0:16:33,591 --> 0:16:36,327
but still it's like that
makes sense to be there.


555
0:16:36,327 --> 0:16:38,63
Jesse Green: See, Missi I
knew you'd figure it out.


556
0:16:38,63 --> 0:16:39,531
Missi: Of course.


557
0:16:39,531 --> 0:16:40,165
Jesse Green: How
come you didn't think


558
0:16:40,165 --> 0:16:41,9
of that before?


559
0:16:41,9 --> 0:16:44,636
I don't know why I
doubt you, Missi.


560
0:16:44,636 --> 0:16:46,237
Keith: We gotta be able
to get the reservoir in,


561
0:16:46,237 --> 0:16:47,372
so it fits.


562
0:16:47,372 --> 0:16:48,239
Jesse Green: Dude, I want
to know that this whole


563
0:16:48,239 --> 0:16:49,307
thing works before
I leave here.


564
0:16:49,307 --> 0:16:50,375
Keith: Don't worry, we
aren't gonna make you


565
0:16:50,375 --> 0:16:52,577
look like a fool in
front of 1500 people.


566
0:16:52,577 --> 0:16:53,578
Jay Green: Just stand
right in front of it and


567
0:16:53,578 --> 0:16:54,712
I'll be very happy.


568
0:16:54,712 --> 0:16:56,714
Jesse Green: Don't you
dare squirt me with that.


569
0:16:56,714 --> 0:17:1,886
Jay Green: Okay, go ahead.


570
0:17:1,886 --> 0:17:4,22
Missi: Nothing?


571
0:17:4,22 --> 0:17:4,823
Oh.


572
0:17:4,823 --> 0:17:5,623
Jay Green: What the hell?


573
0:17:5,623 --> 0:17:6,524
Keith: That's
very lackluster.


574
0:17:6,524 --> 0:17:7,625
Missi: Oh, yeah.


575
0:17:7,625 --> 0:17:8,726
Jay Green:
What's happened?


576
0:17:8,726 --> 0:17:10,762
Missi: That's not as far
as it went the other day.


577
0:17:10,762 --> 0:17:11,83
Jesse Green: Whoa.


578
0:17:11,83 --> 0:17:12,797
Missi: What do you want
me to do, anything?


579
0:17:12,797 --> 0:17:14,299
Keith: Hold your fingers
together and pray.


580
0:17:14,299 --> 0:17:15,366
Jesse Green: Really?


581
0:17:15,366 --> 0:17:16,367
It's minutes before we
have to leave for the


582
0:17:16,367 --> 0:17:18,47
circus and the water
pump is not working.


583
0:17:18,47 --> 0:17:19,37
Really?


584
0:17:19,37 --> 0:17:20,638
Like really.


585
0:17:20,638 --> 0:17:21,973
Is that really what's
happening right now?


586
0:17:21,973 --> 0:17:28,713
This, really?


587
0:17:28,713 --> 0:17:29,28
Jay Green: What the hell?


588
0:17:29,28 --> 0:17:30,381
What's happened?


589
0:17:30,381 --> 0:17:31,883
Missi: That's not as far
as it went the other day.


590
0:17:31,883 --> 0:17:33,17
Jesse Green: Really?


591
0:17:33,17 --> 0:17:34,152
Jesse Green: It's minutes
before we have to leave


592
0:17:34,152 --> 0:17:35,954
for the circus and the
water pump is not working.


593
0:17:35,954 --> 0:17:38,56
We have no idea
what's wrong.


594
0:17:38,56 --> 0:17:42,293
Jay Green: Do that
again, give it a shot.


595
0:17:42,293 --> 0:17:43,261
Missi: It's gotta
to be the battery.


596
0:17:43,261 --> 0:17:44,262
Jay Green: It's
gotta be the battery.


597
0:17:44,262 --> 0:17:45,396
Missi: We have to go
get another battery.


598
0:17:45,396 --> 0:17:46,3
Jesse Green: Where
do you get that?


599
0:17:46,3 --> 0:17:46,664
Jay Green: I don't know.


600
0:17:46,664 --> 0:17:47,465
Missi: Hardware store?


601
0:17:47,465 --> 0:17:48,32
Jay Green: A
hardware store.


602
0:17:48,32 --> 0:17:48,833
Try anything.


603
0:17:48,833 --> 0:17:50,101
Jesse Green: I
hate detours.


604
0:17:50,101 --> 0:17:51,369
Missi: You don't have
to worry about it.


605
0:17:51,369 --> 0:17:52,337
I'll handle it.


606
0:17:52,337 --> 0:17:53,4
I won't let you down.


607
0:17:53,4 --> 0:17:54,339
Haven't yet.


608
0:17:54,339 --> 0:17:55,273
Jesse Green:
Missi's saying she's


609
0:17:55,273 --> 0:17:56,407
never let me down.


610
0:17:56,407 --> 0:17:58,76
If that's true then why
isn't this thing working?


611
0:17:58,76 --> 0:17:59,477
I thought this
was the solution


612
0:17:59,477 --> 0:18:0,445
windshield wipers.


613
0:18:0,445 --> 0:18:2,13
Missi better fix
this problem because


614
0:18:2,13 --> 0:18:4,15
battery or not we have
to get to the circus.


615
0:18:4,15 --> 0:18:6,151
Keith: Let's get
this baby wrapped up.


616
0:18:6,151 --> 0:18:7,385
Jesse Green: Grab
that sheet somebody.


617
0:18:7,385 --> 0:18:8,486
If this touches
the ground, Brett,


618
0:18:8,486 --> 0:18:10,855
I swear to God Texas
Clover Leaf times 10.


619
0:18:10,855 --> 0:18:11,823
Jay Green:
We're in a rush,


620
0:18:11,823 --> 0:18:12,991
Jesse's going crazy,


621
0:18:12,991 --> 0:18:14,526
everybody else
is going crazy.


622
0:18:14,526 --> 0:18:16,761
He always manages
somehow to work right up


623
0:18:16,761 --> 0:18:17,829
to the last minute.


624
0:18:17,829 --> 0:18:20,365
This is going to be
extremely tight.


625
0:18:20,365 --> 0:18:22,3
Beth Green: No detours
go the fastest route.


626
0:18:22,3 --> 0:18:23,501
Jesse Green: I
know how to go.


627
0:18:23,501 --> 0:18:24,269
Beth Green: You sure.


628
0:18:24,269 --> 0:18:25,303
Jesse Green:
I'm from here.


629
0:18:25,303 --> 0:18:25,904
Beth Green: You're going
to be there, right?


630
0:18:25,904 --> 0:18:26,504
Jesse Green: Sure.


631
0:18:26,504 --> 0:18:27,205
Beth Green: Like soon.


632
0:18:27,205 --> 0:18:28,54
Jesse Green: Yeah.


633
0:18:28,54 --> 0:18:30,8
I really hope Missi
can get that battery


634
0:18:30,8 --> 0:18:35,48
or we are (bleep) screwed.


635
0:18:35,48 --> 0:18:37,482
Missi: I am on my way
to the hardware store


636
0:18:37,482 --> 0:18:38,85
to try to get
this battery.


637
0:18:38,85 --> 0:18:41,553
I'm hoping that is the
issue that we're having


638
0:18:41,553 --> 0:18:44,255
'cause if it's not I don't
know what we're gonna do.


639
0:18:44,255 --> 0:18:47,926
I'll be in big trouble
that's for sure.


640
0:18:47,926 --> 0:18:49,127
Hey.


641
0:18:49,127 --> 0:18:50,895
Jesse Green: Hey, did
you get a battery?


642
0:18:50,895 --> 0:18:53,331
Missi: I'm on my way,
if you keep calling me


643
0:18:53,331 --> 0:18:54,599
it's gonna
take more time.


644
0:18:54,599 --> 0:18:56,0
I gotta concentrate
on driving and


645
0:18:56,0 --> 0:18:57,202
where I am because I,


646
0:18:57,202 --> 0:18:58,937
we are in the
middle of nowhere.


647
0:18:58,937 --> 0:19:0,338
Jesse Green: We are
just barely gonna


648
0:19:0,338 --> 0:19:3,708
make it I think.


649
0:19:3,708 --> 0:19:4,609
Oh God!


650
0:19:4,609 --> 0:19:6,177
We're not
gonna make it!


651
0:19:6,177 --> 0:19:6,878
We're not
gonna make it!


652
0:19:6,878 --> 0:19:8,413
We're not
gonna make it!


653
0:19:8,413 --> 0:19:9,614
We're not
gonna make it.


654
0:19:9,614 --> 0:19:10,715
Jay Green: We're
gonna make it.


655
0:19:10,715 --> 0:19:11,716
Jesse Green: I don't
think we're gonna make it.


656
0:19:11,716 --> 0:19:13,51
Jay Green: They can't
start without you.


657
0:19:13,51 --> 0:19:14,252
Jesse Green:
Yeah they can.


658
0:19:14,252 --> 0:19:15,653
We might literally be
presenting this thing by


659
0:19:15,653 --> 0:19:29,968
the porter potties
after the show.


660
0:19:29,968 --> 0:19:31,436
Oh Grandma.


661
0:19:31,436 --> 0:19:32,604
Jay Green: Easy!


662
0:19:32,604 --> 0:19:35,306
Jesse Green: Don't tell me
easy it's a speed bump.


663
0:19:35,306 --> 0:19:36,74
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
Hey Jesse!


664
0:19:36,74 --> 0:19:37,308
Jesse Green:
Hey Guillaume,


665
0:19:37,308 --> 0:19:38,409
nice to see you again.


666
0:19:38,409 --> 0:19:39,77
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
Welcome.


667
0:19:39,77 --> 0:19:39,877
So, everything's good?


668
0:19:39,877 --> 0:19:40,778
Jesse Green:
Everything's good.


669
0:19:40,778 --> 0:19:41,679
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
You know what?


670
0:19:41,679 --> 0:19:42,78
10 minutes before we go.


671
0:19:42,78 --> 0:19:44,282
Jesse Green: I will
bring it right in.


672
0:19:44,282 --> 0:19:45,16
No problem.


673
0:19:45,16 --> 0:19:45,85
Thanks man.


674
0:19:45,85 --> 0:19:46,884
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
Take care.


675
0:19:46,884 --> 0:19:47,452
Jesse Green: Dude where
the hell is Missi?


676
0:19:47,452 --> 0:19:48,152
Keith: I called her.


677
0:19:48,152 --> 0:19:49,153
She'll be here any minute.


678
0:19:49,153 --> 0:19:50,21
Jesse Green: (Bleep),
what the hell does


679
0:19:50,21 --> 0:19:50,888
that mean dude?


680
0:19:50,888 --> 0:19:51,723
Keith: I don't
have a GPS on her.


681
0:19:51,723 --> 0:19:52,657
Jesse Green: We
are minutes to


682
0:19:52,657 --> 0:19:54,492
show time and we still
have no battery.


683
0:19:54,492 --> 0:19:56,327
If Missi doesn't show
up right now this is


684
0:19:56,327 --> 0:19:58,396
gonna be a
spectacular disaster.


685
0:19:58,396 --> 0:19:59,13
Missi: Hey!


686
0:19:59,13 --> 0:20:0,31
I got it.


687
0:20:0,31 --> 0:20:1,65
Keith: Awesome.


688
0:20:1,65 --> 0:20:1,899
Missi: I told you I
wouldn't let you down.


689
0:20:1,899 --> 0:20:2,7
Keith: I told
you any minute.


690
0:20:2,7 --> 0:20:3,635
Jesse Green: Thank you.


691
0:20:3,635 --> 0:20:4,68
Let's go.


692
0:20:4,68 --> 0:20:5,3
Come on.


693
0:20:5,3 --> 0:20:5,503
Keith: Alright, I
don't think we have


694
0:20:5,503 --> 0:20:8,94
time to test it.


695
0:20:8,94 --> 0:20:10,174
Radio: 90 seconds,
90 seconds.


696
0:20:10,174 --> 0:20:11,909
Jesse Green: Come
on, come on, come on.


697
0:20:11,909 --> 0:20:13,144
Keith: Oh, it's stuck.


698
0:20:13,144 --> 0:20:14,312
Radio: You got
30 seconds now.


699
0:20:14,312 --> 0:20:15,513
Jesse Green: I
need more time!


700
0:20:15,513 --> 0:20:17,48
The walkie talkie's
going, "90 seconds,


701
0:20:17,48 --> 0:20:18,182
60 seconds, 10 seconds."


702
0:20:18,182 --> 0:20:20,118
I'm not sure if this
thing's gonna squirt


703
0:20:20,118 --> 0:20:21,719
and I just hope
to God it works.


704
0:20:21,719 --> 0:20:22,887
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
Good evening.


705
0:20:22,887 --> 0:20:23,655
Jesse Green: Is the
battery hooked up?


706
0:20:23,655 --> 0:20:25,189
Keith: Everything
is all set.


707
0:20:25,189 --> 0:20:26,257
Everything is all set.


708
0:20:26,257 --> 0:20:27,325
Jesse Green: Ready,
ready, ready, ready!


709
0:20:27,325 --> 0:20:28,593
Radio: That's your
cue, that's your cue.


710
0:20:28,593 --> 0:20:29,994
Stage Manager: You're
on Jesse, you're on.


711
0:20:29,994 --> 0:20:31,663
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
Ladies and gentlemen,


712
0:20:31,663 --> 0:20:34,265
"the Machine" Jesse Green.


713
0:20:34,265 --> 0:20:42,106
<i> [audience applause].</i>


714
0:20:42,106 --> 0:20:44,542
Jesse Green: How's
everybody feeling tonight?


715
0:20:44,542 --> 0:20:48,212
<i> [audience applause].</i>


716
0:20:48,212 --> 0:20:51,349
At this time I'd like
to call out Grandma so


717
0:20:51,349 --> 0:20:56,487
we can unveil
this sculpture.


718
0:20:56,487 --> 0:20:57,755
Grandma, Grandma!


719
0:20:57,755 --> 0:21:0,591
I've been commissioned
to honor you in wood.


720
0:21:0,591 --> 0:21:4,462
Would you like to see
what I came up with?


721
0:21:4,462 --> 0:21:9,4
And, go!


722
0:21:9,4 --> 0:21:20,411
<i> [audience applause].</i>


723
0:21:20,411 --> 0:21:23,548
Guillaume Dufresnoy: You
never looked that good!


724
0:21:23,548 --> 0:21:25,717
Jesse Green: Grandma
seems genuinely touched


725
0:21:25,717 --> 0:21:27,752
and Guillaume seems to
like the sculpture too.


726
0:21:27,752 --> 0:21:29,387
Now comes the
moment of truth.


727
0:21:29,387 --> 0:21:32,223
I'm just praying that
this water pump works.


728
0:21:32,223 --> 0:21:33,558
Grandma would you
mind showing us


729
0:21:33,558 --> 0:21:36,828
that trick of yours?


730
0:21:36,828 --> 0:21:38,229
<i> [audience laughing].</i>


731
0:21:38,229 --> 0:21:39,664
Jesse Green: That's good.


732
0:21:39,664 --> 0:21:44,35
Grandma I don't know
if I can match that,


733
0:21:44,35 --> 0:21:46,904
but I do have a trick that
I'd like to show you.


734
0:21:46,904 --> 0:21:48,39
Allow me to demonstrate.


735
0:21:48,39 --> 0:21:50,708
Let me just reach down
into this Grandma's bag of


736
0:21:50,708 --> 0:22:2,553
tricks and, uh, let's see
what we can come up with.


737
0:22:2,553 --> 0:22:12,497
<i> [audience applause].</i>


738
0:22:12,497 --> 0:22:13,464
Guillaume Dufresnoy:
I think it couldn't


739
0:22:13,464 --> 0:22:14,265
have gone better.


740
0:22:14,265 --> 0:22:15,32
The results are great and


741
0:22:15,32 --> 0:22:16,401
it had the water
spitting feature


742
0:22:16,401 --> 0:22:17,668
which is really
what I wanted.


743
0:22:17,668 --> 0:22:19,737
I'm a happy client
with a happy clown.


744
0:22:19,737 --> 0:22:20,838
Jesse Green: What
can I say man?


745
0:22:20,838 --> 0:22:21,773
Presenting the sculpture,


746
0:22:21,773 --> 0:22:22,907
in the Big Top,


747
0:22:22,907 --> 0:22:25,176
was an awesome
experience.


748
0:22:25,176 --> 0:22:27,111
My team came through
in a big way.


749
0:22:27,111 --> 0:22:28,746
I still can't
believe we get to


750
0:22:28,746 --> 0:22:30,114
do this for a living.


751
0:22:30,114 --> 0:24:30,114
Have a great
circus everybody!
