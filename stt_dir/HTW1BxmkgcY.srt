a couple jumps, or at

is taking the early steps.

certified to be a guide.


14

I'm going to spend most my time
with my head in the snow

snow crystal is morphing with


16
0:0:51,8 --> 0:0:56,77
another one, which is all
knowledge that the future of

have if they want to go to

does this Backside

around him.

it from a really heavy skate

0:9:21,1 --> 0:9:25,7
influence scene and time and
really gone with snowboarding


190
0:9:25,7 --> 0:9:28,32

mountains, I mean he's really


191
0:9:28,32 --> 0:9:29,7
at a legendary status.


192
0:9:29,7 --> 0:9:31,69
The lock down that he
has on Jackson Hole,


193
0:9:31,69 --> 0:9:33,68
and just his guiding.


194
0:9:33,68 --> 0:9:37,56
And I think he's just about to
revamp this whole thing, which


195
0:9:37,56 --> 0:9:40,11
is his potential and influence
that he can have on


196

JAKE PRICE: That was
fucking awesome.


204
0:9:52,1 --> 0:9:55,51
BRYAN IGUCHI: This is a
fun, fun little jump.


205
0:9:55,51 --> 0:9:58,302
This is fun, you know.


206
0:9:58,302 --> 0:10:0,22
VERNON: Dude, the Back
7 was so sick.


207
0:10:0,22 --> 0:10:2,828
BRYAN IGUCHI: Oh, thanks, man.


208
0:10:2,828 --> 0:10:4,76
VERNON: Man.


209
0:10:4,76 --> 0:10:7,31
BRYAN IGUCHI: This is my
snowboard park, you know.


210
0:10:7,31 --> 0:10:9,85
JAKE PRICE: Yeah,
just like the--


211
0:10:9,85 --> 0:10:11,314
BRYAN IGUCHI: Kind of like
go to fun session jump.


212
0:10:11,314 --> 0:10:13,684
VERNON: It's sick.


213
0:10:13,684 --> 0:10:14,16
That was great.


214
0:10:14,16 --> 0:10:17,8
BRYAN IGUCHI: That cliff up
there is pretty sweet, man.


215
0:10:17,8 --> 0:10:18,4
It reminds me of Mission.


216
0:10:18,4 --> 0:10:22,11
There's a step-down over here,
too, that might be in.


217
0:10:22,11 --> 0:10:23,1
Did those guys go
to the boundary?


218
0:10:23,1 --> 0:10:23,49
JAKE PRICE: Yep.


219
0:10:23,49 --> 0:10:24,27
BRYAN IGUCHI: Cool.


220
0:10:24,27 --> 0:10:25,93
JAKE PRICE: Should we probably
go over and meet them?


221
0:10:25,93 --> 0:10:27,81
VERNON: It that far
over, or not?


222
0:10:27,81 --> 0:10:28,85
More or less, or?


223
0:10:28,85 --> 0:10:29,59
BRYAN IGUCHI: Whatever
you want.


224
0:10:29,59 --> 0:10:30,425
JAKE PRICE: Can we bring
them back and


225
0:10:30,425 --> 0:10:31,675
just have a fun session?


226
0:10:31,675 --> 0:10:34,54



227
0:10:34,54 --> 0:10:36,205
How did you get-- oh, that's
a snowmobiler.


228
0:10:36,205 --> 0:10:38,21
Oh see, that's a 6 slash
right there, too.


229
0:10:38,21 --> 0:10:38,94
VERNON: In the pocket?


230
0:10:38,94 --> 0:10:40,35
JAKE PRICE: Yeah.


231
0:10:40,35 --> 0:10:40,915
VERNON: It's beautiful.


232
0:10:40,915 --> 0:10:42,2
I'd love to shoot
with him there.


233
0:10:42,2 --> 0:10:44,106
JAKE PRICE: You can get up a
little higher and see all the


234
0:10:44,106 --> 0:10:45,84
[INAUDIBLE], too.


235
0:10:45,84 --> 0:10:48,152
VERNON: He's going to be here
in the morning, huh?


236
0:10:48,152 --> 0:10:49,402
Before the sledders come?


237
0:10:49,402 --> 0:12:49,402
