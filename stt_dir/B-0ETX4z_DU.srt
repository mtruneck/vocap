0:0:7,708 --> 0:0:11,224
(Jacque Fresco) The discussion
today is about depression.


2
0:0:11,224 --> 0:0:15,4
There are many people that have
been depressed for many years


3
0:0:15,4 --> 0:0:17,527
and I get lots of letters.


4
0:0:17,527 --> 0:0:20,0
Sometimes they say that


5
0:0:20,0 --> 0:0:25,19
"I found no meaning in
life, no purpose, and


6
0:0:25,19 --> 0:0:27,528
you pulled me out of it."


7
0:0:27,528 --> 0:0:30,0
I get a lot of letters like that


8
0:0:30,0 --> 0:0:35,135
so the only thing I can say [is
that] it's not due to genetics.


9
0:0:35,135 --> 0:0:38,715
If it was due to genetics,
I couldn't pull them out.


10
0:0:38,715 --> 0:0:40,968
Does that make sense to you?


11
0:0:40,968 --> 0:0:44,231
What is depression?


12
0:0:44,231 --> 0:0:48,356
If you live vicariously
through another person


13
0:0:48,356 --> 0:0:52,336
(let's say you rely on
that person entirely)


14
0:0:52,336 --> 0:0:55,406
you live, and that person dies


15
0:0:55,406 --> 0:0:57,577
you lose your identity


16
0:0:57,577 --> 0:1:0,677
because you put your
identity in another person


17
0:1:0,677 --> 0:1:2,83
which isn't a good thing to do.


18
0:1:2,83 --> 0:1:7,37
That's a kind of dependency.
You know what I mean?


19
0:1:7,37 --> 0:1:11,96
That's a part of depression,
a little bit of it.


20
0:1:11,96 --> 0:1:14,659
The rest is loss of identity.


21
0:1:14,659 --> 0:1:16,918
You can lose your identity


22
0:1:16,918 --> 0:1:19,782
if you're brought up with
a philosophy of life


23
0:1:19,782 --> 0:1:22,664
that doesn't reinforce you.


24
0:1:22,664 --> 0:1:25,751
If you're brought up with a set
of values: "Do the right thing


25
0:1:25,751 --> 0:1:28,139
and everything will
work out all right"


26
0:1:28,139 --> 0:1:31,403
and if it doesn't work out all
right, you become depressed


27
0:1:31,403 --> 0:1:35,769
because you lose predictability.
Is that clear?


28
0:1:35,769 --> 0:1:40,654
If you have predictability about
yourself and other people


29
0:1:40,654 --> 0:1:44,64
you can anticipate
certain things.


30
0:1:44,64 --> 0:1:50,246
If you have no answer, if you
look for answers in your own mind


31
0:1:50,246 --> 0:1:53,213
it isn't exposed enough.


32
0:1:53,213 --> 0:1:58,48
There's not enough in schools
that give you a way of thinking


33
0:1:58,48 --> 0:2:0,547
so you can solve problems.


34
0:2:0,547 --> 0:2:4,471
It isn't that they don't want to.
They don't have it.


35
0:2:4,471 --> 0:2:8,608
They've never found a way of
thinking they can solve problems.


36
0:2:8,608 --> 0:2:12,709
That's why, when the
businessman retires


37
0:2:12,709 --> 0:2:15,0
he may become depressed


38
0:2:15,0 --> 0:2:18,838
because he has no game to play.


39
0:2:18,838 --> 0:2:24,263
All his life, say a guy that owns a
jewelry store, that sells jewelry


40
0:2:24,263 --> 0:2:26,916
and every sale makes
him feel good.


41
0:2:26,916 --> 0:2:29,431
Then he retires


42
0:2:29,431 --> 0:2:31,885
and he has nothing anymore.


43
0:2:31,885 --> 0:2:35,94
He has no identity, except
'sales of jewelry.'


44
0:2:35,94 --> 0:2:38,397
Do you understand? That's gone?


45
0:2:38,397 --> 0:2:40,753
What follows is depression.


46
0:2:40,753 --> 0:2:44,28
There are some dogs that
have been depressed


47
0:2:44,28 --> 0:2:48,485
due to that they had a very close
relationship with their master.


48
0:2:48,485 --> 0:2:50,612
When the master dies


49
0:2:50,612 --> 0:2:54,286
they sat next to the master
and wouldn't go away


50
0:2:54,286 --> 0:2:58,93
and bark at anybody that
would try to take them away.


51
0:2:58,93 --> 0:3:3,584
Their full identification was
as a team with their master.


52
0:3:3,584 --> 0:3:6,841
They had no identification
when the master died.


53
0:3:6,841 --> 0:3:10,306
They had no way
of looking at it.


54
0:3:10,306 --> 0:3:13,334
The difference between humans
and most animals [is that]


55
0:3:13,334 --> 0:3:17,772
most animals don't fear death.
They don't even know there is such a thing.


56
0:3:17,772 --> 0:3:22,214
They move away from animals
that are larger than they are.


57
0:3:22,214 --> 0:3:25,724
That's a reflex, but they
don't know what death is


58
0:3:25,724 --> 0:3:28,798
nor do they think of it.


59
0:3:28,798 --> 0:3:32,0
So far, any questions?


60
0:3:32,0 --> 0:3:34,415
Okay.


61
0:3:34,415 --> 0:3:37,491
A person then asks
themselves questions:


62
0:3:37,491 --> 0:3:39,867
"Why did my wife leave me?"


63
0:3:39,867 --> 0:3:43,947
and they can't figure it out,
because everything they've done


64
0:3:43,947 --> 0:3:47,0
was pleasing


65
0:3:47,0 --> 0:3:49,223
and they don't understand that.


66
0:3:49,223 --> 0:3:53,563
That is not necessarily
a logical question.


67
0:3:53,563 --> 0:3:57,256
Your wife may have left you
for many different reasons:


68
0:3:57,256 --> 0:4:1,643
that she likes a guy tall,
with blond wavy hair


69
0:4:1,643 --> 0:4:4,41
or stocky, or whatever.


70
0:4:4,41 --> 0:4:7,76
If you don't meet that image,
she might leave you.


71
0:4:7,76 --> 0:4:12,905
The assumption that she won't leave
you is what can depress you.


72
0:4:12,905 --> 0:4:14,9
Your assumption about the world:


73
0:4:14,9 --> 0:4:19,623
"Surely they won't have another war,
while they're having a war now!"


74
0:4:19,623 --> 0:4:22,684
you can't say that. You can say


75
0:4:22,684 --> 0:4:27,94
"I'd like to see peace on
Earth," so you work toward it


76
0:4:27,94 --> 0:4:29,54
but if you hope there's
peace on Earth


77
0:4:29,54 --> 0:4:33,701
you might get depressed
by the next war.


78
0:4:33,701 --> 0:4:37,966
See, when people ask me, "When
will the Venus Project be built?"


79
0:4:37,966 --> 0:4:40,588
The honest answer
is "I don't know."


80
0:4:40,588 --> 0:4:42,932
I don't even know
if we'll get there


81
0:4:42,932 --> 0:4:48,574
but I can't accept what I
see, so I try to intervene.


82
0:4:48,574 --> 0:4:53,0
Intervening, does that mean we'll
have a better world? Not necessarily.


83
0:4:53,0 --> 0:4:55,816
Whatever you get
is what you get.


84
0:4:55,816 --> 0:4:57,558
Do you understand that?


85
0:4:57,558 --> 0:4:59,207
The assumptions:


86
0:4:59,207 --> 0:5:3,987
"Surely people can all see the
logic of a one global society."


87
0:5:3,987 --> 0:5:6,226
No, they can't!


88
0:5:6,226 --> 0:5:8,673
That's a major problem


89
0:5:8,673 --> 0:5:10,781
so you use different techniques


90
0:5:10,781 --> 0:5:14,962
to try to get them
oriented towards that.


91
0:5:14,962 --> 0:5:19,66
Okay, so what is depression
and how do you get rid of it?


92
0:5:19,66 --> 0:5:21,685
If you're depressed it means


93
0:5:21,685 --> 0:5:25,38
you're looking within
yourself for answers


94
0:5:25,38 --> 0:5:27,776
and you can't get that.


95
0:5:27,776 --> 0:5:30,558
How did I get it?


96
0:5:30,558 --> 0:5:34,702
I didn't find it in
psychology books at all.


97
0:5:34,702 --> 0:5:37,837
Here's how I got it.


98
0:5:37,837 --> 0:5:42,693
I sat down, I said: "What is depression?
" I said "I don't know."


99
0:5:42,693 --> 0:5:44,86
How can I know what it is?


100
0:5:44,86 --> 0:5:50,338
A depressed person always seems
to have a low self-image.


101
0:5:50,338 --> 0:5:52,19
Do you know what that means?


102
0:5:52,19 --> 0:5:56,0
"I'm not getting anywhere in life.
I'm not respected


103
0:5:56,0 --> 0:5:59,304
three girls have left me.
" Whatever it is


104
0:5:59,304 --> 0:6:3,778
it's a low self-sufficiency
to start with.


105
0:6:3,778 --> 0:6:7,81
Instead of looking for
'the girl of your dreams'


106
0:6:7,81 --> 0:6:10,925
you try to make her.
Do you know what that means?


107
0:6:10,925 --> 0:6:13,848
Educate her, in
whatever way you can.


108
0:6:13,848 --> 0:6:16,225
Does it mean it will
work perfectly? No.


109
0:6:16,225 --> 0:6:19,661
But it will work better
than you doing nothing.


110
0:6:19,661 --> 0:6:21,57
Do you understand that?


111
0:6:21,57 --> 0:6:26,97
Therefore depression is not
only loss of self-image


112
0:6:26,97 --> 0:6:28,387
they have none.


113
0:6:28,387 --> 0:6:31,192
A guy finds himself
in the Marines


114
0:6:31,192 --> 0:6:34,61
and he wants to be
successful in the Marines


115
0:6:34,61 --> 0:6:37,173
and that can't bring success


116
0:6:37,173 --> 0:6:41,241
unless they give you medals and
everybody pats you on the back.


117
0:6:41,241 --> 0:6:45,932
That's your self-image:
"I made it," you can say.


118
0:6:45,932 --> 0:6:49,208
Or an actor, that does...


119
0:6:49,208 --> 0:6:53,578
a theater actor that acts
before a live audience


120
0:6:53,578 --> 0:6:55,423
and they applaud after.


121
0:6:55,423 --> 0:6:57,134
That makes him feel good.


122
0:6:57,134 --> 0:6:59,691
[When it's] a movie,
he doesn't know.


123
0:6:59,691 --> 0:7:4,121
If he works in a movie, he doesn't
know that people are going to applaud.


124
0:7:4,121 --> 0:7:6,9
Do you understand that?


125
0:7:6,9 --> 0:7:9,4
Therefore, he could
encounter depression.


126
0:7:9,4 --> 0:7:12,99
Anybody that does any routine:


127
0:7:12,99 --> 0:7:17,706
a job, a jeweler, a plumber,
an artist, a painter


128
0:7:17,706 --> 0:7:20,987
if they don't get rewarded
for their painting


129
0:7:20,987 --> 0:7:24,12
like "You're a genius,
you're good, creative"


130
0:7:24,12 --> 0:7:26,554
that makes them go on painting.


131
0:7:26,554 --> 0:7:29,671
If people say "What the hell
is that supposed to be?"


132
0:7:29,671 --> 0:7:33,129
If they paint because they like
to paint that's much better


133
0:7:33,129 --> 0:7:35,242
if that occurs.


134
0:7:35,242 --> 0:7:38,125
If you go for a walk because
you like to go for a walk


135
0:7:38,125 --> 0:7:40,682
not because the doctor
told you to go for a walk


136
0:7:40,682 --> 0:7:43,953
everyday, for at
least a half hour


137
0:7:43,953 --> 0:7:46,967
but if you don't do it
because you want to do it


138
0:7:46,967 --> 0:7:49,201
Ii you go out for a walk
through the country


139
0:7:49,201 --> 0:7:52,251
and you smell the trees
and you look around


140
0:7:52,251 --> 0:7:54,734
and you're pleased
by that, do it.


141
0:7:54,734 --> 0:7:57,263
If it depresses you
going for a walk


142
0:7:57,263 --> 0:8:0,926
you have to restore
the self-image.


143
0:8:0,926 --> 0:8:4,583
In most instances there
is no self-image


144
0:8:4,583 --> 0:8:7,446
so you have to give
them a self-image.


145
0:8:7,446 --> 0:8:11,303
You have to talk about a lot of
things [like] "I didn't know that


146
0:8:11,303 --> 0:8:14,254
that water became ice suddenly.


147
0:8:14,254 --> 0:8:16,6
I thought it was gradually
how it became..."


148
0:8:16,6 --> 0:8:21,688
Whatever it is, if you expose them
to different branches of science


149
0:8:21,688 --> 0:8:25,587
and they begin to find
answers that satisfy them


150
0:8:25,587 --> 0:8:28,167
their self-image grows.


151
0:8:28,167 --> 0:8:30,647
If you make a Lutheran out
of a person that says


152
0:8:30,647 --> 0:8:33,312
"Have faith in God.
He'll look after you"


153
0:8:33,312 --> 0:8:36,651
if you put that faith in
somebody you can't see or touch


154
0:8:36,651 --> 0:8:39,123
it may carry you through


155
0:8:39,123 --> 0:8:41,679
because you know there's
somebody up there that loves you


156
0:8:41,679 --> 0:8:43,946
even though nobody does


157
0:8:43,946 --> 0:8:46,196
(that there is
somebody up there)


158
0:8:46,196 --> 0:8:48,527
and that helps some people


159
0:8:48,527 --> 0:8:52,742
but it's not genuine help.
Do you understand?


160
0:8:52,742 --> 0:8:56,587
Because [he] says to the
minister "What did I do wrong?"


161
0:8:56,587 --> 0:9:0,315
If you believe in right and
wrong, you can get depressed:


162
0:9:0,315 --> 0:9:2,747
"I must have done
the wrong thing."


163
0:9:2,747 --> 0:9:5,451
It isn't the 'wrong'
thing that you do.


164
0:9:5,451 --> 0:9:8,815
It's a less valid
thing that you do.


165
0:9:8,815 --> 0:9:12,37
It's a less appropriate thing that you do.
Do you know what I mean?


166
0:9:12,37 --> 0:9:15,128
Not wrong.
If you work on somebody:


167
0:9:15,128 --> 0:9:19,594
"Snap out of that depression!
Have faith in yourself


168
0:9:19,594 --> 0:9:21,377
and confidence!"


169
0:9:21,377 --> 0:9:24,898
Well, they might get fooled
"Gee, you sound great!"


170
0:9:24,898 --> 0:9:28,795
but that doesn't take
away that self-image.


171
0:9:28,795 --> 0:9:33,422
You don't take away the self-image.
You add to it.


172
0:9:33,422 --> 0:9:37,354
You understand what that means?
Whatever the person is.


173
0:9:37,354 --> 0:9:44,209
They only have no self-image.
They don't know who they are.


174
0:9:44,209 --> 0:9:47,421
(If you're in pain, that's different.
I'm not talking about that.


175
0:9:47,421 --> 0:9:51,88
If you have a tumor growing in your
lungs and you can hardly breathe


176
0:9:51,88 --> 0:9:55,44
that's something else.
That's not depression.


177
0:9:55,44 --> 0:9:58,99
That's physical disability.)


178
0:9:58,99 --> 0:10:0,615
If you have your health


179
0:10:0,615 --> 0:10:6,373
and you feel that you're
learning something everyday


180
0:10:6,373 --> 0:10:9,283
and don't ever assume that
you can fix something too.


181
0:10:9,283 --> 0:10:12,919
You can try to fix it: "I
am going to try to fix it"


182
0:10:12,919 --> 0:10:15,214
and if that doesn't work you
come at it another way.


183
0:10:15,214 --> 0:10:17,718
If that doesn't work,
say "I can't handle it:


184
0:10:17,718 --> 0:10:22,155
I need more information
in that area."


185
0:10:22,155 --> 0:10:24,882
That's what self-confidence is.


186
0:10:24,882 --> 0:10:29,312
The more genuine information a
person has in certain areas...


187
0:10:29,312 --> 0:10:33,754
People that do feel "I can't
get up before hundred people


188
0:10:33,754 --> 0:10:35,898
and say something because


189
0:10:35,898 --> 0:10:39,5
I worry about
whether I'll 'goof'


190
0:10:39,5 --> 0:10:41,807
and they'll laugh at me."


191
0:10:41,807 --> 0:10:43,911
Here's how you handle that:


192
0:10:43,911 --> 0:10:47,247
You never talk to
people to win approval.


193
0:10:47,247 --> 0:10:49,685
You talk to people to inform.


194
0:10:49,685 --> 0:10:52,419
If you were in a
building, in the hallway


195
0:10:52,419 --> 0:10:57,49
and a big beam fell on fire, you'd
go in for the thousand people


196
0:10:57,49 --> 0:11:0,271
and say "Exit as fast as you can.
There's a fire!"


197
0:11:0,271 --> 0:11:3,433
and you won't feel bad about
it because what you're saying


198
0:11:3,433 --> 0:11:6,502
is essential to their well-being


199
0:11:6,502 --> 0:11:9,567
but when you gamble and you
say "I don't believe in God!"


200
0:11:9,567 --> 0:11:12,944
at a church meeting,
they'd all say "What?!"


201
0:11:12,944 --> 0:11:16,221
They're not going to say "How
do you account for all this?"


202
0:11:16,221 --> 0:11:18,417
They don't even do that.


203
0:11:18,417 --> 0:11:24,214
If they don't do that, there's no bridge.
You have to build a bridge.


204
0:11:24,214 --> 0:11:28,305
Even a religious person, when
they get a [broken] window crank


205
0:11:28,305 --> 0:11:30,424
and they crank it and
the window doesn't open


206
0:11:30,424 --> 0:11:33,354
they take it back
to the company.


207
0:11:33,354 --> 0:11:35,707
They need verification.


208
0:11:35,707 --> 0:11:37,841
When they buy something
the [sales] guy says


209
0:11:37,841 --> 0:11:40,463
"If you buy this window
it's hurricane-proof


210
0:11:40,463 --> 0:11:45,231
because there's a sheet of plastic
between two sheets of glass


211
0:11:45,231 --> 0:11:48,684
so you can't smash
it with an object."


212
0:11:48,684 --> 0:11:52,964
You have to give the person
with a low self-sufficiency


213
0:11:52,964 --> 0:11:59,165
a high self-sufficiency by
giving him a direction, or her


214
0:11:59,165 --> 0:12:2,256
so they don't concentrate
on themselves:


215
0:12:2,256 --> 0:12:5,826
"I've been working all these years
and I've nothing to show for it!"


216
0:12:5,826 --> 0:12:8,855
"Did you assume that you
would have something?"


217
0:12:8,855 --> 0:12:13,839
What you have to do is engage in
self-image and ask questions:


218
0:12:13,839 --> 0:12:18,846
Why I am depressed?
Why do I feel insufficient in a crowd?


219
0:12:18,846 --> 0:12:22,987
Because I'm hoping the crowd
will like what I say.


220
0:12:22,987 --> 0:12:24,67
[As for me] I don't give a shit.


221
0:12:24,67 --> 0:12:28,785
If they believe the Earth is
flat and I find out it's round


222
0:12:28,785 --> 0:12:31,287
I enjoy telling them it's round.


223
0:12:31,287 --> 0:12:35,304
If they refuse it, that's
their problem, not mine.


224
0:12:35,304 --> 0:12:40,62
If you feel you are unsuccessful
in presenting an idea


225
0:12:40,62 --> 0:12:46,149
the assumption that you will
be successful is depressing.


226
0:12:46,149 --> 0:12:49,173
Do you understand that?
That's what makes depression.


227
0:12:49,173 --> 0:12:51,429
When you do something
and nothing happens;


228
0:12:51,429 --> 0:12:53,723
when you row a boat
and it doesn't move.


229
0:12:53,723 --> 0:12:56,843
If you get in a boat, and you
don't know how to use the oars


230
0:12:56,843 --> 0:13:0,501
and it doesn't move,
you get depressed.


231
0:13:0,501 --> 0:13:3,55
When you pull on the string
and the motor doesn't start


232
0:13:3,55 --> 0:13:7,956
you say "What the hell?
" and you pull on it, until it does start


233
0:13:7,956 --> 0:13:11,123
or you learn that you might
have to change the spark plug.


234
0:13:11,123 --> 0:13:14,472
It might have a shorter
gap or a longer gap


235
0:13:14,472 --> 0:13:18,344
and you bring the gap closer
together so you have a spark.


236
0:13:18,344 --> 0:13:23,362
If you don't know those basic
things, you can kick the lawnmower.


237
0:13:23,362 --> 0:13:28,98
We tend to project living human
characteristics into things.


238
0:13:28,98 --> 0:13:33,867
Sometimes, if your binoculars don't
work, you throw them on the couch


239
0:13:33,867 --> 0:13:35,519
(do you know what I mean?)


240
0:13:35,519 --> 0:13:37,942
because you get mad
at the binoculars.


241
0:13:37,942 --> 0:13:41,335
You give it a personality "God
damn it, you should work!"


242
0:13:41,335 --> 0:13:46,296
"I paid $40 for it.
That's why it should work."


243
0:13:46,296 --> 0:13:51,1
No, you paid $40 and it doesn't
work, so you take it back


244
0:13:51,1 --> 0:13:54,793
or you leave it until
you go into town again


245
0:13:54,793 --> 0:13:59,593
but throwing it on the couch or
the floor, doesn't make it work.


246
0:13:59,593 --> 0:14:3,12
Sometimes, if there's a
loose wire in your TV set


247
0:14:3,12 --> 0:14:7,189
and you kick the set and the wires
[connect], it'll go on again


248
0:14:7,189 --> 0:14:12,162
so sometimes that carries on
that type of value system.


249
0:14:12,162 --> 0:14:16,244
I think I covered everything
related to depression.


250
0:14:16,244 --> 0:14:23,934
It's a low self-image, or no
self-image, or looking for justice.


251
0:14:23,934 --> 0:14:28,37
If you give them something to
do that they identify with


252
0:14:28,37 --> 0:14:31,5
(not something that you
like) something...


253
0:14:31,5 --> 0:14:34,473
Talk to them about The Venus Project,
work on it, talk to other people


254
0:14:34,473 --> 0:14:37,411
then they feel they
are doing something.


255
0:14:37,411 --> 0:14:41,938
If other people don't understand
them, they might feel disappointed.


256
0:14:41,938 --> 0:14:43,61
What they're disappointed in


257
0:14:43,61 --> 0:14:47,54
is their inability to make
contact with other people.


258
0:14:47,54 --> 0:14:51,682
It takes practice and
error and mistakes.


259
0:14:51,682 --> 0:14:54,53
When I first walked over to [Ku
Klux] Klan people [and said]


260
0:14:54,53 --> 0:14:58,326
"Why are you beating up the black guy?
He didn't do anything to you"


261
0:14:58,326 --> 0:15:2,194
they just said "There's a
nigger-lover from the North!"


262
0:15:2,194 --> 0:15:7,574
They did not hear that nor could they hear that.
Do you understand?


263
0:15:7,574 --> 0:15:12,762
If you talk to a depressed person,
and you show them what it is


264
0:15:12,762 --> 0:15:15,183
so that they know
what's wrong with them:


265
0:15:15,183 --> 0:15:17,789
They don't have a self-image.


266
0:15:17,789 --> 0:15:22,65
How do you get a self-image?
By learning new things.


267
0:15:22,65 --> 0:17:22,65
By learning things that take you
out of the old value system.
