###54 Jade Kay: Half a million dollars for a helicopter?
###57 <i> Narrator: The experts  will assess their preps,</i>
###59 <i> to see if they  have what it takes.</i>
###61 Ryan Croft: You've got chaos.
###62 That's where the prepper steps in.
###64 <i> Narrator:  To survive.</i>
###66 Alexis Kay: It's not as easy as it looks in videogames.
###70 <i> Narrator: This is  doomsday preppers.</i>
###87 <i> Bob Kay is the  wealthy creator of a</i>
###89 <i> hugely successful  vitamin supplement.</i>
###92 <i> Living in Temecula,  California, Bob,</i>
###95 <i> his wife and two  young daughters have</i>
###97 <i> almost everything  they could ask for.</i>
###100 Bob Kay: I live on two and a half acres.
###102 The views are spectacular.
###104 I can see mountains in the distance.
###106 I can see the wineries.
###108 It's just an absolutely wonderful
###109 area to live in.
###112 <i> Narrator: But Bob fears  that the cost of owning</i>
###114 <i> this high-priced  real estate could</i>
###116 <i> one day be the lives  of his family because</i>
###119 <i> they're sitting on a  ticking time bomb.</i>
###123 Bob Kay: I'm preparing for a massive earthquake
###125 that will change society as we know it.
###132 I know something is going to go wrong.
###134 I think the people that say nothing will
###136 go wrong and everything will go right,
###138 I think they're obsessive in the wrong direction.
###142 We live on graham cracker crust here.
###145 In this part of Southern California we
###146 don't have one fault, we have approximately
###149 five or six major faults.
###151 <i> Narrator: Although most  are too small to feel,</i>
###153 <i> roughly 10,000  earthquakes strike</i>
###155 <i> Southern California  every year.</i>
###158 <i> Bob believes it's  just a matter of time</i>
###160 <i> before one of them is  powerful enough to</i>
###162 <i> destroy his community and  throw society into chaos.</i>
###167 Bob Kay: We have major earthquake faults
###169 running directly under the major freeways here.
###172 It wouldn't take much for a major earthquake to
###175 pretty much sever those arteries so that folks
###178 can't get materials in and they can't get out.
###181 <i> Narrator: If a magnitude  7.8 quake or stronger</i>
###183 <i> hits California, it could  topple 1,500 buildings,</i>
###187 <i> kill 2,000 people  and damage and</i>
###190 <i> disrupt the  infrastructure survivors</i>
###192 <i> would depend on for  getting food and water.</i>
###196 <i> So Bob's plan is to  turn his two and a</i>
###199 <i> half acre estate into a  self-sustaining oasis</i>
###202 <i> where his family  can safely wait out</i>
###204 <i> the chaos following  a killer quake.</i>
###208 <i> And he's not afraid to  spend money to do it.</i>
###211 Bob Kay: I don't do anything small.
###213 Over the course of the last twelve months
###215 I've spent approximately $150,000 on my preps.
###219 I've been extremely successful at what I do.
###221 And that has allowed me to have the financial
###223 resources and the time to be able to invest part of
###226 my life to making sure my family is taken care of.
###230 <i> Narrator: Many preppers  dream about the elaborate</i>
###232 <i> things they would buy, if  money were not an object.</i>
###235 <i> For Bob, having  multiple back-up</i>
###237 <i> bug-out vehicles  is worth any cost.</i>
###240 Bob Kay: My preferred bug out vehicle?
###242 Motorcycle, nothing impedes the motorcycle.
###245 You can get pretty much anywhere on it.
###247 And I don't have just one, I have six.
###251 <i> Narrator: The motorcycles  cost Bob another $110,000.</i>
###255 <i> He spent $35,000 more  landscaping his estate and</i>
###258 <i> every tree and shrub  serves a prepper purpose.</i>
###263 Bob Kay: I have well over 300 different types
###265 of plants that can be used for food either by
###267 their fruiting or the plant directly.
###271 <i> Narrator: Bob dropped  another $100,000</i>
###273 <i> on a pool in order  to have 35,000</i>
###276 <i> gallons in his  backyard that he can</i>
###278 <i> filter into potable  drinking water.</i>
###281 Bob Kay: Once we distill it and then
###283 just run it through a carbon filter,
###284 it's fine.
###285 You're taking the water, turning it into a gas,
###288 and then converting it back right
###289 into a liquid again.
###291 Cheers.
###294 What do you think?
###295 Alexis Kay: Tastes just like normal water.
###298 <i> Narrator: No matter  how hot it gets,</i>
###300 <i> Bob's forbidden his  kids from swimming</i>
###302 <i> during the day.</i>
###303 <i> He doesn't want  their sunscreen</i>
###305 <i> to contaminate  the water.</i>
###307 <i> But his daughter, Alexis,  still fully supports</i>
###309 <i> her father's extravagant  prepping habit.</i>
###313 Alexis Kay: I like prepping with my dad,
###314 I think it's pretty fun.
###316 I'm pretty much the one that comes up with the
###318 ideas and then my dad buys the preps.
###320 <i> Narrator: Today, Bob  and Alexis are looking</i>
###322 <i> for a freeze-dried  food source</i>
###324 <i> they can  stock up on,</i>
###325 <i> in case earthquakes  one day destroy</i>
###328 <i> California's  supply lines.</i>
###330 Chris: One of my favorites is freeze-dried chicken.
###333 Bob Kay: I love this.
###334 I mean, his is, this is the ultimate
###335 high-tech prepper food.
###337 Chris: You'll notice it actually
###338 kinda re-hydrates in your mouth.
###341 Bob: You know what?
###342 That's really good.
###344 Alexis Kay: Just like chicken.
###345 There's nothing fake in it,
###346 it's just chicken.
###347 Bob Kay: Can you put together like two
###349 or three palettes of stuff?
###350 What do you think it would cost,
###351 per year, per person?
###352 Chris: Somewhere between $12,000 and $16,000 a year.
###356 Bob Kay: I do spend towards the upper end.
###358 I make sure that I get a good value on what I'm
###360 purchasing and I want to make it so it lasts.
###362 <i> Narrator: The average  American household</i>
###364 <i> spends roughly $3,700  on groceries each year.</i>
###368 <i> Bob just spent  more than 10 times</i>
###371 <i> that in a  single day.</i>
###373 <i> Now he has to  tell his wife,</i>
###375 <i> Jade and she doesn't  always find her</i>
###377 <i> husband's spendthrift  ways amusing.</i>
###380 Jade Kay: I'm not a prepper.
###381 I think it's kind of, uh, weird.
###384 It's weird;
###386 it's a little bit crazy.
###387 I don't think, you know,
###389 that something will happen.
###391 How much did this food cost?
###392 Bob Kay: Uh, it's very reasonable.
###394 It's um.
###395 Jade Kay: Reasonable means what?
###396 Bob Kay: Uh, about $40,000.
###398 Jade Kay: What?
###399 Bob Kay: Yeah.
###400 Jade Kay: $40,000 for food!
###401 What if nothing happens?
###402 What are you going to do with the food?
###404 Bob Kay: That, that's a very good question.
###406 In terms of how I prep, I always think of the
###409 greatest value, because if my life's on the line
###411 or my family's welfare is on the line,
###413 I don't want to have to be second guessing
###415 what I've done.
###416 <i> Narrator: Bob and  Alexis spend much of</i>
###418 <i> their quality time  together prepping.</i>
###420 <i> But they worry that their  home full of expensive</i>
###423 <i> preps would be an  irresistible target</i>
###425 <i> for desperate, violent  looters in the chaos</i>
###427 <i> following catastrophic  earthquakes.</i>
###430 <i> So recently, they've been  focusing on security</i>
###432 <i> and defensive preps.</i>
###434 Bob Kay: If the house were to become compromised
###436 or I am not able to get home,
###437 Alexis is fully capable of defending herself.
###440 <i> Narrator: Like  many children,</i>
###441 <i> Alexis is drawn  to martial arts.</i>
###444 <i> She received her second  degree black belt</i>
###446 <i> in tae-kwon-do  when she was ten.</i>
###448 Bob Kay: Ow.
###452 <i> Narrator: But Alexis  wants to be able to</i>
###454 <i> defend herself before a  violent confrontation</i>
###456 <i> comes down to  hand-to-hand combat.</i>
###459 <i> She recently told her  father she wanted</i>
###462 <i> to learn how to  throw knives.</i>
###464 <i> So Bob custom built a  target range on his</i>
###466 <i> property and  bought her $1,000</i>
###469 <i> worth of top of  the line knives.</i>
###471 Bob Kay: These knives are incredibly high quality.
###474 The larger ones we use are actually
###477 competition quality knives.
###479 It's a very effective, concealable type
###482 of weapon for self defense.
###484 Very convenient.
###486 You have to have a lot of respect for a knife
###487 or a bladed weapon and
###489 she's learning the respect.
###491 Alexis Kay: I was more influenced by
###492 videogames than anything else,
###493 because any videogame character,
###496 you tell it to throw a knife and it looks easy,
###498 it looks effortless.
###499 So I thought, why not?
###501 Why not try throwing knives?
###503 But when you actually try to throw a knife,
###506 it's a lot more of a challenge than
###507 it actually looks.
###510 Bob Kay: Perfect.
###513 Pretty good.
###515 <i> Narrator: Throwing  knives would help Alexis</i>
###517 <i> in a short-range fight,  but she also wants an</i>
###519 <i> option to protect  herself from attackers</i>
###522 <i> at even greater  distances.</i>
###524 <i> So Bob's hired her  a personal firearm</i>
###527 <i> instructor, spent $4,000  on a high-end rifle,</i>
###532 <i> built a private shooting  range on his own property</i>
###535 <i> and added $300 of zombie  targets that bleed</i>
###539 <i> or explode to get her  accustomed to aiming</i>
###541 <i> at a human figure.</i>
###543 Nate: You're too close to the scope.
###545 Lean forward.
###549 Can you see your target?
###550 Alexis Kay: Yeah.
###551 Nate: Okay, ready to fire?
###553 Fire!
###554 Good job!
###555 Bob: First shot, that gun I can't do that.
###558 One shot, right through the top of the chest.
###562 Joel: It's where you want it.
###563 Bob: That was incredible.
###564 Nate: That's a combat accurate hit right there.
###567 You can't ask any more than that from this far.
###570 Bob Kay: You guys did a great job, thank you.
###572 Alexis Kay: Definitely not as easy as it
###573 looks in video games.
###579 <i> Narrator: Including  Alexis' defensive</i>
###581 <i> training, Bob's  already spent $150,000</i>
###584 <i> on prepping in  the past year.</i>
###586 <i> But now he wants to ensure  his family has a clear</i>
###589 <i> path to safety, if  California is ever</i>
###591 <i> leveled by a  massive earthquake.</i>
###594 <i> So he's about to  spend almost half a</i>
###596 <i> million dollars on  one final prep.</i>
###605 Bob Kay: A year ago I'm watching
###606 Doomsday Preppers and I come to the
###609 realization: I'm a prepper.
###612 <i> Narrator: In Bob Kay's  first year as a prepper,</i>
###614 <i> he spent $150,000  preparing his southern</i>
###617 <i> California estate for a  catastrophic earthquake.</i>
###622 <i> He just spent  another $40,000</i>
###624 <i> on freeze-dried food.</i>
###625 Alexis Kay: It's like freeze-dried
###626 life insurance.
###628 <i> Narrator: And the  constant spending is</i>
###629 <i> threatening to  divide the family.</i>
###631 Jade Kay: It's so much money.
###633 I think prepping is a little bit crazy.
###636 Um, I still think it's kind
###638 of wasting, wasting money.
###641 <i> Narrator: Bob lives only  an hour away from a</i>
###643 <i> nuclear plant he fears  wouldn't withstand</i>
###645 <i> a quake greater than 7.0.</i>
###648 <i> For most, quickly  escaping nuclear fallout</i>
###651 <i> would be an  insurmountable obstacle,</i>
###653 <i> but Bob can afford to  spend his way to safety.</i>
###657 Bob Kay: If things go really badly,
###659 nobody's going to be getting out of
###661 this area by a truck or bus or a car.
###664 The way to go, gotta take it to a new level.
###672 <i> Narrator: Today, Bob  and his daughter,</i>
###674 <i> Alexis, are meeting  pilot Johan Nurmi.</i>
###677 Bob Kay: Let's do it.
###683 Want to talk to you about some helicopters,
###685 need your services.
###686 Johan Nurmi: Yes sir.
###686 I recommend this one.
###688 It's a four seater.
###689 She can carry 800 pounds inside and
###692 we can still have fuel.
###693 Bob Kay: Okay, and range?
###695 Johan Nurmi: We can fly for about two
###696 and a half hours.
###698 In California you have an airport every
###699 30 miles approximately.
###701 Bob Kay: Ahhhh!
###702 Johan Nurmi: So you have no problem get fuel.
###704 Something happens; I'll be there in five minutes.
###706 I'll rescue you.
###707 Land outside your driveway and off we go.
###709 Bob Kay: This looks like the way to go.
###710 Looks like it has plenty of room, so how much?
###716 Jade Kay: You actually purchased
###718 a helicopter, or?
###719 Okay, how much, how much does the helicopter cost?
###724 Bob Kay: About half a million dollars.
###725 Jade Kay: What?
###726 Half a million dollars for helicopter?
###728 Bob Kay: Well, you gotta let me tell
###729 you the rest of it though.
###730 We're going to do a test run.
###732 We're gonna have a helicopter come here.
###733 We can land it out here, right out here.
###735 We should give it a try.
###736 Keeping in mind that there are about a quarter
###738 of a million people living in this area and
###740 bugging out isn't necessarily the
###743 easiest thing to do.
###744 One highway in, one highway out.
###746 The advantages of using some type of
###748 air transport, helicopter, allows one to take off
###751 and land in a very small area.
###753 It's a tremendous advantage.
###755 A little bit pricey way to go,
###756 but it does deliver on the solution.
###760 My wife does view many of the activities
###763 that I engage in for prepping with amusement.
###767 The truth of the matter is she does understand
###770 the type of environment we live in.
###772 We've experienced several earthquakes.
###774 So she does appreciate truly that
###777 being prepared is important.
###778 To me, major earthquake, if it was a matter of
###781 money to save my family's lives and
###783 take care of their well being,
###785 show me where I stick the debit card.
###794 <i> Narrator: Bob,  the experts,</i>
###795 <i> Practical Preppers, have  assessed your preps.</i>
###797 <i> Your gardens, orchard,  and stored food will</i>
###799 <i> be a great asset if it  comes to feeding your</i>
###802 <i> family over an extended  period of time.</i>
###804 <i> However, currently you  lack sources of protein.</i>
###807 <i> The experts recommend  you start raising</i>
###809 <i> chickens and rabbits.</i>
###811 Bob Kay: I think we need to find an alternative
###813 and I think the stores that we can purchase
###816 that are freeze dried would be an
###817 excellent alternative.
###819 <i> Narrator: Your  35, 000-gallon pool</i>
###821 <i> is a good start  for water supply,</i>
###823 <i> but relying on the pool  alone will leave you</i>
###825 <i> without any potable  water at all should</i>
###827 <i> your desalination  equipment ever fail.</i>
###830 Bob Kay: We had thought about drilling a well.
###831 We tried to get permits;
###833 not allowed because the water rights
###835 are not ours.
###838 <i> Narrator: To determine how  long you could initially</i>
###840 <i> survive a catastrophe,  Practical Preppers has</i>
###843 <i> scored your preps in  five categories of</i>
###846 <i> 20 points each, for  a total possible</i>
###848 <i> score of 100.</i>
###850 <i> Food: 11 out of  20 points.</i>
###853 <i> Water: 17 out  of 20 points.</i>
###856 <i> Shelter: 9 out  of 20 points.</i>
###859 <i> Security: 13 out  of 20 points.</i>

###867 <i> Overall your score  is 61 out of 100.</i>
###871 <i> You have nine months  initial survival time.</i>
###874 Bob Kay: I agree with most of it except its
###876 left out a critical factor:
###877 our ability to have business activities
###879 and barter and increase our ability
###882 to live a longer period of time.
###886 <i> Narrator: Experts rate  the likelihood of a</i>

###891 <i> the fault under  Temecula, California</i>
###893 <i> within the next  30 years at 11%.</i>
###901 <i> Josh Wander is a  deeply religious</i>
###903 <i> prepper living  in Pittsburgh.</i>
###906 <i> He fears the  end is coming,</i>
###908 <i> but can he prep to  keep his family</i>
###910 <i> alive without disobeying  his God's commands?</i>
###929 <i> Narrator: Josh Wander  is a husband and father</i>
###931 <i> of six who moved from  Jerusalem, Israel,</i>
###934 <i> to Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania,</i>
###936 <i> about 10 years ago.</i>
###937 Josh Wander: You all buckled up?
###938 You ready?
###939 Here we go.
###941 <i> Narrator: He's devoted to  his orthodox Jewish faith,</i>
###943 <i> his family and  community politics.</i>
###945 Josh Wander: A normal day in my life
###947 starts off around 6:30 in the morning
###950 where I go to pray in synagogue.
###952 After that, I start my campaigning.
###955 Thanks, thank you.
###957 <i> Narrator: Each day, Josh  works on his campaign</i>
###960 <i> for city council,  cares for his children</i>
###962 <i> and fulfills his  prayer obligations.</i>
###966 <i> But every moment  not devoted to God,</i>
###968 <i> his kids, and politics,  he spends prepping.</i>
###973 Josh Wander: I'm preparing for a
###974 series of catastrophic terrorist attacks,
###977 which will fundamentally change
###978 our lives as we know it.
###989 Terrorist attacks are just a way of life
###991 and something that's necessary to prepare for.
###994 It wouldn't be difficult for terrorists to blow
###997 themselves up in suicide bombs in major cities,
###1000 buses, in malls throughout the United States.
###1003 There would be continuous attacks on
###1005 these locations over and over again.
###1008 Police, firemen, and the paramedics would
###1011 come to respond.
###1012 There would be additional attacks as soon as the
###1015 first responders would come that would
###1018 kill and maim those people.
###1019 This is something that was perfected in
###1021 the Middle East.
###1023 People would be afraid to use mass transportation;
###1026 afraid to go to stores for fear that there
###1029 would be continuous attacks.
###1031 People would be stuck in their homes in fear
###1033 without the ability to bring in new resources.
###1037 Once that happened there's going to be
###1040 a lot of people dying very quickly.
###1041 <i> Narrator: Josh is  running for a seat</i>
###1043 <i> on Pittsburgh's  city council.</i>
###1045 <i> But, unlike his  opponent, the focus of</i>
###1047 <i> his platform is  not improving the</i>
###1049 <i> city's infrastructure.</i>
###1051 <i> Josh believes  terrorist attacks</i>
###1053 <i> could happen at  any moment,</i>
###1054 <i> so he wants the entire  city of Pittsburgh</i>
###1057 <i> to begin prepping.</i>
###1059 Josh Wander: As a politician,
###1060 I'm looking at the welfare of the
###1062 greater community.
###1063 I educate people on the
###1065 importance of preparedness.
###1067 What's motivating me to run for Pittsburgh
###1069 city council is that fact that there is
###1071 no preparedness at all.
###1073 People are not listening.
###1074 What we need is somebody who's going to stand up
###1076 and legislate and explain that there has
###1078 to be required education.
###1079 David Raphael: You see these people now
###1081 worried about you know, building bunkers.
###1083 Everyone's building bunkers now.
###1084 And that's cool and if I had the money,
###1086 I'd build a bunker.
###1087 Like that, that's great.
###1088 I think it would be nice to have someone
###1090 involved in government that wants to be prepared.
###1093 I would vote for Josh Wander unconditionally.
###1096 <i> Narrator: Josh  believes politicians</i>
###1097 <i> like himself will  be targeted when</i>
###1099 <i> terrorists attack and  he fears one of his</i>
###1101 <i> own political rallies  could soon be the scene of</i>
###1104 <i> a massacre aimed  at silencing him.</i>
###1107 <i> In the last year, the  number of government</i>
###1109 <i> officials killed in  terrorist attacks</i>
###1111 <i> worldwide increased  more than 13 percent.</i>
###1114 <i> So today, he's putting  his staff through</i>
###1116 <i> their first mass  casualty drill.</i>
###1118 Josh Wander: Let's get bloodied up.
###1120 It's a misnomer that people
###1122 panic during attacks.
###1123 Instead you find that people just
###1125 shut down and they don't move.
###1127 <i> Narrator: In a  life-threatening</i>
###1128 <i> situation, instead  of fight or flight,</i>
###1130 <i> the human body will  sometimes freeze,</i>
###1132 <i> or play possum, to avoid  becoming a target.</i>
###1135 <i> To help his team fight  that urge in a real</i>
###1137 <i> catastrophe, Josh is  trying to get them used</i>
###1140 <i> to acting in a crisis  by making this scene</i>
###1142 <i> of carnage as  realistic as possible.</i>
###1145 Josh Wander: Doing something repetitively
###1147 ingrains it into you, so that when something
###1150 actually happens you won't break down.
###1152 <i> Narrator: Josh was trained  as an EMS responder</i>
###1155 <i> in Jerusalem and  witnessed the impact</i>
###1157 <i> of suicide bombings  first hand.</i>
###1159 <i> Terrorist attacks  sometimes happen in</i>
###1161 <i> quick succession,  with secondary bombs</i>
###1163 <i> exploding once emergency  responders arrive,</i>
###1166 <i> to prevent people  from receiving care.</i>
###1168 <i> So Josh is training  his team to secure</i>
###1171 <i> the perimeter before  attending to any victims.</i>
###1173 Josh Wander: I want all three of you to
###1175 make a perimeter, then we're gonna go and
###1176 treat the wounded.
###1177 Come on, quickly, quickly!
###1180 EMS: Clear over here.
###1181 Josh Wander: Okay, it seems safe.
###1183 Now let's start treating them.
###1184 Joe: He's breathing, pulse is rapid.
###1188 All right, let's red tag him.
###1190 <i> Narrator: Each victim  is assessed and</i>
###1191 <i> assigned a color  coded tag based on</i>
###1193 <i> the severity of  his injuries.</i>
###1195 <i> Green for minor  injuries that can wait,</i>
###1198 <i> yellow for urgent  but stable,</i>
###1200 <i> red for critical.</i>
###1201 Joe: Do we have a pulse?
###1202 Student: No pulse.
###1203 <i> Narrator: And black.</i>
###1204 Joe: No pulse, no breathing.
###1206 He's a black tag, he's gone.
###1208 Let's get help to the other people.
###1209 Josh Wander: We put an enormous
###1211 amount of sanctity on life.
###1212 We need to just save as many lives as possible.
###1217 This is exactly why I'm a prepper.
###1219 Because I think that the survival
###1221 of my family, friends, supporters,
###1223 is, is my ultimate responsibility.
###1231 <i> Narrator: Josh's  orthodox faith impacts</i>
###1233 <i> every aspect of  his prepping.</i>
###1236 <i> But can he prepare his  family for the life of</i>
###1238 <i> terrorist attacks  he fears without</i>
###1241 <i> having to  disobey God?</i>
###1249 <i> Narrator: Josh Wander is  a Pittsburgh politician</i>
###1252 <i> who fears a series of  terrorist attacks will</i>
###1254 <i> soon tear across  the United States.</i>
###1257 <i> He believes the  unpredictability and</i>
###1259 <i> frequency of the attacks  will force people to</i>
###1261 <i> remain in their homes  and survive off only</i>
###1263 <i> what they  have on hand.</i>
###1265 <i> So Josh is  preparing to bug in</i>
###1267 <i> for at least  three months.</i>
###1268 Josh Wander: Urban centers would be targeted
###1271 in any terrorist attack.
###1273 It would make most sense to basically
###1275 stay put for a period of time.
###1277 <i> Narrator: Josh has  been trying to build up a</i>
###1279 <i> stockpile of provisions  for when doomsday comes.</i>
###1282 <i> But as an orthodox Jew,  he faces a complication</i>
###1285 <i> that most preppers don't  have to worry about.</i>
###1287 Josh Wander: We have to keep kosher.
###1289 So our food preparations have to
###1291 be all certified kosher.
###1293 <i> Narrator: Because of  the trouble he's had</i>
###1294 <i> finding kosher  food designed</i>
###1296 <i> for long shelf life,</i>
###1297 <i> it's taken Josh three  years to accumulate</i>
###1300 <i> just a three month  supply of kosher</i>
###1302 <i> preps that  won't spoil.</i>
###1305 Josh Wander: Matzah, I believe,
###1306 is actually the ultimate prepper food.
###1309 <i> Narrator: Unleavened  bread made only from</i>
###1311 <i> flour and water,  Matzah is a source of</i>
###1313 <i> protein and  carbohydrates and has</i>
###1315 <i> a two and half  year shelf life.</i>
###1317 Josh Wander: I've seen these boxes be opened
###1319 years after its expiration and it's still fresh.
###1323 <i> Narrator: Josh also has  a dozen cases of kosher</i>
###1325 <i> MRE's, enough for 144  1,200-calorie meals,</i>
###1330 <i> which have been  cooked and</i>
###1332 <i> packaged under  rabbinical supervision,</i>
###1333 <i> and can last up  to five years.</i>
###1336 Josh Wander: Kosher MRE's are specifically
###1339 made for Orthodox Jews who are in the military.
###1343 They are U.S. military rations,
###1346 and they are completely kosher.
###1349 <i> Narrator: Having served in  the Israeli defense forces,</i>
###1351 <i> Josh has experience  surviving off MRE's.</i>
###1354 <i> But his  children don't.</i>
###1355 <i> So today, he's giving  them a taste of what</i>
###1357 <i> they'll be in for, if  multiple terrorist</i>
###1360 <i> attacks confine  them to their home.</i>
###1362 Josh Wander: You're gonna pour in just a drop, okay?
###1364 <i> Narrator: The heater  pouch is filled with</i>
###1366 <i> iron and  magnesium dust.</i>
###1367 <i> When they come in  contact with water they</i>
###1369 <i> begin to rust, and  the rapid oxidation</i>
###1372 <i> generates heat.</i>
###1373 Josh Wander: Feel it, Sara?
###1375 That's how the chemicals work.
###1376 Feel how hot it is?
###1377 Josh Wander: Baruch atah adonai,
###1379 elohenu melech ha'olam, borei mi nay mazanos.
###1382 Tamara: Ewww, it looks like barf.
###1384 Sara: It looks like barf.
###1387 Josh Wander: Not bad.
###1388 Make a mazanos close your eyes and eat it,
###1390 come on.
###1390 Tamara: No.
###1392 Josh Wander: Come on.
###1393 Tamara: No!
###1395 Josh Wander: Corn and, and carrots.
###1398 No?
###1399 That's just 'cause your sister told you not to,
###1401 right?
###1401 Cause you were about to do it.
###1403 <i> Narrator: Josh's  current store of kosher</i>
###1404 <i> supplies should  last 90 days.</i>
###1406 <i> But he fears wave after  wave of terrorist</i>
###1408 <i> attacks could keep  Pittsburgh under siege</i>
###1410 <i> longer than  three months.</i>
###1412 Josh Wander: Whoever has a bite of this can have a treat.
###1414 Who's gonna have it?
###1415 <i> Narrator: If that  were to happen,</i>
###1416 <i> Josh believes he'd  eventually be forced to</i>
###1418 <i> choose between  keeping kosher and</i>
###1420 <i> staying alive.</i>
###1421 Josh Wander: There are 613 commandments
###1423 in the Torah.
###1424 We are instructed to break any of those
###1428 rules in order to save life.
###1430 If necessary we could eat pork,
###1433 we could eat shellfish or
###1434 any other non-kosher species for
###1437 the preservation of life.
###1438 Under normal circumstances is
###1440 a rabbit kosher?
###1442 Daughter: No.
###1443 Josh Wander: Right?
###1445 Rabbits are not kosher.
###1446 In fact, it says in the bible,
###1447 it mentions rabbits as one of the species
###1449 which is not kosher.
###1451 <i> Narrator: Because  these rabbits are</i>
###1452 <i> raised to be dinner,</i>
###1454 <i> Josh won't allow his  children to give them names.</i>
###1456 Josh Wander: They're not pets.
###1457 We do play with them, but they understand
###1460 that they're eventually going to be used for food.
###1463 Tamara: I think it's disgusting.
###1464 Josh Wander: It's disgusting?
###1465 But it's better than dying right?
###1467 Tamara: No.
###1468 Josh Wander: I don't feel conflicted at all
###1469 once we've finished all of our kosher options
###1472 it smoothly transitions to whatever's out there and,
###1475 that's necessary to preserve life.
###1477 <i> Narrator: Keeping kosher  isn't the only Jewish</i>
###1478 <i> tradition Josh may  have to break with in</i>
###1480 <i> order to keep his  family alive.</i>
###1482 <i> If terrorism comes  to Pittsburgh,</i>
###1484 <i> Josh and his children  are willing to do</i>
###1486 <i> whatever it takes to  protect themselves.</i>
###1489 Josh Wander: Jewish law is clear that we are
###1491 obligated to defend ourselves to the
###1494 point of using lethal force in order
###1497 to preserve our lives.
###1499 <i> Narrator: Today, Josh  is taking Hannah and</i>
###1501 <i> Etan to their local  shooting range.</i>
###1503 <i> As a certified  NRA instructor,</i>
###1506 <i> Josh makes sure they  practice once a week,</i>
###1508 <i> so that their shooting  skills are honed</i>
###1510 <i> in case of an onslaught  of terrorist attacks.</i>
###1512 Josh Wander: Now look between these two
###1514 and this and see the read.
###1515 Okay, whenever you're ready put the
###1516 finger in and slowly pull once.
###1517 <i> [gunshot].</i>
###1518 Slowly, slowly, that was way too fast.
###1520 Continue to look through it.
###1522 Relax, relax.
###1524 <i> [gunshot].</i>
###1525 Good, perfect.
###1528 Deep breath, relax, lean forward a little bit.
###1532 <i> [gunshot].</i>
###1533 Most children out there know to pick up a phone
###1535 and dial 911, unfortunately very few
###1538 know what to do when they pick up the phone and
###1540 there's no dial tone on the other end.
###1546 <i> Narrator: As much as  Josh loves Pittsburgh,</i>
###1548 <i> he believes it's  possible that,</i>
###1550 <i> in the wake of  terrorist attacks and</i>
###1552 <i> subsequent looting,  their home could</i>
###1554 <i> no longer be  a safe haven.</i>
###1555 <i> So if the terrorists  gain the upper hand,</i>
###1558 <i> Josh has a plan.</i>
###1559 Josh Wander: We would have to get
###1561 out from this urban death trap.
###1563 We would definitely be bugging out
###1565 to a remote location.
###1567 If they're woken up in the middle of the night,
###1569 they know to bug out.
###1570 It's something that we constantly work on.
###1573 We're bugging out!
###1574 <i> Narrator: Josh's  15-passenger van</i>
###1576 <i> is large enough to  fit his family</i>
###1578 <i> of eight and  some supplies.</i>
###1581 <i> His plan is to camp  in a wooded area,</i>
###1583 <i> where he hopes he can  remain camouflaged</i>
###1586 <i> until he can determine  his family's safest</i>
###1587 <i> route out of the city.</i>
###1591 Josh Wander: We're headed into the forest
###1594 in order to reassess the situation.
###1599 The relationship between Judaism and
###1601 prepping is very strong.
###1603 Jewish communities throughout the millennia
###1605 have been required to bug out.
###1608 The Exodus was a form of a bug out.
###1611 They were forced to very quickly pick up their
###1613 things and marched out of Egypt to the Holy Land.
###1615 Moses did what was necessary for himself
###1617 and his nation in order to survive.
###1620 Just like any other time in world history the ones
###1623 that are gonna survive are those that are prepared.
###1631 The ultimate prepper food.
###1637 <i> Narrator: Josh,  the experts,</i>
###1638 <i> Practical Preppers have  reviewed your preps.</i>
###1640 <i> Your rainwater catchment  barrels are a good idea;</i>
###1643 <i> however, you  should consider</i>
###1645 <i> storing more water.</i>
###1646 <i> 250 gallons is not enough  for a family of eight.</i>
###1650 Josh Wander: 250 gallons is just the
###1651 beginning of our preps.
###1653 I think we have plenty of water to go around.
###1656 <i> Narrator: We suggest  that you include</i>
###1657 <i> others in your plans.</i>
###1658 <i> In an urban  environment,</i>
###1660 <i> you will find your greatest  strength in numbers.</i>
###1662 Josh Wander: There's a lot that we've learned
###1664 through our military experience.
###1665 One of the things that we've learned is
###1667 the fact that in order to improve you
###1669 have to hear the negative as well.
###1671 <i> Narrator: To determine how  long you could initially</i>
###1673 <i> survive a catastrophe,  Practical Preppers has</i>
###1675 <i> scored your preps in  five categories of</i>
###1678 <i> 20 points each, for a total  possible score of 100.</i>
###1683 <i> You need a more  complete food plan:</i>
###1685 <i> 11 out of  20 points.</i>
###1687 <i> Water: 14 out  of 20 points.</i>
###1690 <i> Shelter: 12 out  of 20 points.</i>
###1693 <i> Security: forming a  prepping group would give</i>
###1696 <i> you a more complete  skill base:</i>
###1697 <i> 17 out of 20 points.</i>
###1700 <i> For attempting to inform  your community about</i>
###1702 <i> prepping through your  political campaign,</i>
###1704 <i> you receive 16  x-factor points.</i>
###1707 <i> Overall, your score  is 70 out of 100.</i>
###1711 <i> You have 12 months  initial survival time.</i>
###1714 Josh Wander: Well, a 70 is generally a passing grade,
###1717 but I'm not satisfied with it.
###1718 I would say that it's necessary to do better
###1721 and we're always looking at ways that
###1724 we can better ourselves.
###1727 Since National Geographic was here,
###1730 things have been getting a lot worse in this country.
###1733 We've decided that if necessary,
###1735 myself and my family are going to move back to
###1738 Israel, where Jews are protected and safe.
###1743 <i> Narrator: Despite  more than 10,000</i>
###1745 <i> terrorist attacks and  12,000 deaths in 2011,</i>
###1748 <i> more than 3/4 of those  attacks occurred</i>
###1751 <i> in the near east  and south Asia.</i>
###1753 <i> Overall, the total number  of terrorist attacks</i>
###1755 <i> worldwide dropped almost  12% to a five-year low.</i>
###1762 <i> Ryan Croft is willing  to eat anything,</i>
###1764 <i> if it means keeping  his family alive.</i>
###1766 Ryan Croft: And he's dinner.
###1768 All right, guys.
###1769 <i> Narrator: But when it  comes to their safety,</i>
###1771 <i> only the best will do.</i>
###1773 <i> So he's attempting  to build the</i>
###1774 <i> perfect prepper  weapon system with</i>
###1777 <i> his own two hands.</i>
###1779 Ryan Croft: Frontal!
###1796 <i> Narrator: Ryan Croft is  a former airman in the</i>
###1798 <i> US Air Force who now works  as a weapons manufacturer</i>
###1802 <i> in Asheville,  North Carolina.</i>
###1805 <i> With five teenage  boys at home,</i>
###1807 <i> keeping enough food  in the house is a</i>
###1808 <i> constant battle for Ryan  and his wife, Rebecca.</i>
###1812 <i> But it's even harder when  they're also trying to</i>
###1815 <i> stockpile provisions for  the end of the world.</i>
###1820 Ryan Croft: We're preparing to stand our
###1822 ground during a worldwide financial collapse.
###1824 Frontal!
###1825 Alex: Covering!
###1828 Ryan Croft: Our country's not okay,
###1830 our world is not okay and it's not getting better.
###1833 There aren't enough resources.
###1834 Can FEMA arrive?
###1835 Uh-huh.
###1836 Can FEMA arrive in a thousand cities at once?
###1838 Nuh-uh.
###1840 So who are they going to show up for?
###1841 You, me?
###1843 That's where the prepper steps in.
###1847 I'm not gonna sit and wait for someone else
###1849 to come up with solutions when so often
###1852 I've been involved with government.
###1854 Their solutions suck.
###1863 <i> Narrator: Ryan fears  the economy will</i>
###1864 <i> soon collapse, and  that when it does,</i>
###1867 <i> it'll take society  along with it.</i>
###1870 Ryan Croft: The value of your dollar
###1872 is completely artificial.
###1874 Our financial collapse has already started.
###1876 We're just in the gentle glide of
###1879 the collapse right now.
###1881 How close are we?
###1882 The only reason why it keeps going forward
###1885 is because of consumer confidence.
###1887 You knock consumer confidence out of the way;
###1889 you've got chaos in different and
###1892 varying degrees around the world.
###1894 <i> Narrator: Experts  recommend preppers in</i>
###1896 <i> heavily populated areas  have bug-out locations</i>
###1899 <i> at least two hours  outside of city centers,</i>
###1902 <i> to which they can  escape in a crisis.</i>
###1904 <i> But if the economy  does collapse,</i>
###1906 <i> as Ryan fears,  he has no plans</i>
###1908 <i> to cut and run.</i>
###1912 Ryan Croft: We love our community.
###1913 We are heavily invested.
###1914 As preppers, we are not going anywhere.
###1916 This is our town.
###1917 This is where we live and we love these people.
###1920 Whatever they're missing,
###1921 if I can fill in the pieces, I will.
###1923 <i> Narrator: Currently only  1% of the food consumed</i>
###1925 <i> in western North Carolina  is grown locally.</i>
###1928 <i> But Ryan's not  stockpiling canned or</i>
###1930 <i> dried food for  his community.</i>
###1932 <i> Instead, he's planning  on growing an algae</i>
###1936 <i> that's one of the simplest  life forms on earth.</i>
###1939 Ryan Croft: I'm very excited
###1940 about culturing Spirulina.
###1942 Spirulina alone promises to take starvation
###1948 out of any crisis in the world.
###1950 <i> Narrator: Spirulina  is an algae so rich</i>
###1952 <i> in vitamins, protein,  and other nutrients</i>
###1955 <i> that it's been said a  person could survive</i>
###1957 <i> on it and  water alone.</i>
###1959 <i> Spirulina's even  been included in</i>
###1960 <i> planned diets for NASA  missions to mars.</i>
###1965 Israel: What exactly does blowing air
###1968 into this tank do anyway?
###1970 Ryan Croft: Agitation is really good
###1971 for the solution but also you are
###1974 introducing carbon dioxide and oxygen.
###1976 It loves carbon dioxide.
###1981 The best way to harvest Spirulina is
###1983 to just put a tube in.
###1985 Almost like siphoning gasoline.
###1987 I mean, you can eat it right off the
###1989 filter cloth if you wanted to.
###1990 It's like a buttery,
###1991 almost tasteless substance.
###1993 You need about five to 10 grams of it daily
###1996 to get a good nutritive supplemental supply.
###2000 If you want to live on it alone,
###2001 probably 20 grams a day.
###2003 <i> Narrator: Ryan thinks  his ten gallon aquarium</i>
###2005 <i> can produce up to five grams  of Spirulina each day.</i>
###2009 <i> That means by his  estimates he'd</i>
###2012 <i> need more than 30  Spirulina aquariums</i>
###2014 <i> just to feed his  family of seven.</i>
###2017 <i> In order to make it  a resource for his</i>
###2019 <i> whole community, he's  recruited friends and</i>
###2021 <i> neighbors to help him  establish Spirulina</i>
###2023 <i> farms throughout town.</i>
###2025 Ryan Croft: Your number one resource
###2026 should be people.
###2029 And that is not on most people's preppers list.
###2032 They think that means I've got a doctor.
###2034 I've got a tactician, I've got an engineer;
###2037 that's not people, those are jobs.
###2041 We'd like to select maybe a half a dozen
###2044 people that we can actually spread this
###2046 Spirulina tech to right away so that we have
###2050 got 100 to 150 gallons on hand fully
###2053 mature and available.
###2056 You only need about 15 milliliters to go in,
###2058 start a new colony.
###2059 So we'd have the resources to set up about
###2062 1,000 little microfarms.
###2065 I believe that the people with the greatest
###2067 chance of survival are those that can
###2070 genuinely stick together.
###2072 I'm talkin' about regionally stick together,
###2074 I don't mean your little 20-person group.
###2076 That's not enough.
###2078 You need as many people as you can to
###2082 have the same objective.
###2083 And that is to stay alive with one condition:
###2087 Everyone lives, no one dies.
###2089 <i> Narrator: If America's  food supply lines break</i>
###2091 <i> down following an  economic collapse,</i>
###2094 <i> Ryan understands  not everyone in his</i>
###2095 <i> community will  want to eat algae.</i>
###2098 <i> So he's cultivating  another abundant</i>
###2100 <i> source of protein:  earthworms.</i>
###2103 Ryan Croft: Six little worms will provide
###2105 you with an entire day's worth of
###2107 high quality protein.
###2108 You'll have a thousand or 2 or 3,000 of
###2110 them in the average American yard.
###2112 Once you hit about 3,000 worms,
###2114 you're always going to have worms.
###2117 So guys this is our next little piece of
###2120 survival tech for prepping our city.
###2124 Tom: The big question is,
###2126 which one of you guys,
###2128 is gonna have the worm?
###2129 The first worm.
###2131 Israel: I think that will be you.
###2132 Tom: No, I'm talking about you young kids.
###2135 Kid: I don't like worms.
###2136 Ryan Croft: Oh they're tasty;
###2137 wait till you try one.
###2139 My gosh, they are flavorful.
###2141 Kid: No thank you.
###2142 Ryan Croft: It's important to teach my
###2144 kids because morale and mindset is
###2147 a huge component to survival.
###2149 So long as you don't think it's a worm,
###2151 it's a lot easier on the mind.
###2152 <i> Narrator: Earthworms  provide a comparable</i>
###2154 <i> amount of protein you  can get eating eggs or</i>
###2156 <i> cow's milk, and are  consumed regularly in</i>
###2158 <i> almost 90 countries.</i>
###2161 <i> Ryan prefers his  with hot sauce.</i>
###2168 Ryan Croft: Hot sauce goes a long way with
###2169 helping you eat things you normally wouldn't eat.
###2172 Alex: Corbin!
###2173 I'll pick one out for you, a good one.
###2175 We'll give you this little guy.
###2177 Hold him, clean him off.
###2179 Corbin: This is so crazy.
###2185 Alex: No sauce.
###2185 He's straight up, he's a man.
###2187 Tom: Oh, you're the man.
###2188 Ryan Croft: Tastes like dirt, huh?
###2191 Corbin: Yeah.
###2192 Tom: Wow, nice.
###2193 Good man!
###2195 You did well, I'm proud of you boy.
###2198 Corbin: I would have to be pretty hungry
###2199 to eat one of those but I would do it.
###2201 Ryan Croft: You have the capability of
###2203 taking care of yourself with only
###2205 that which nature provides in abundance.
###2208 Adaptability, flexibility is the number one
###2212 skill that you should cultivate in yourself.
###2215 <i> Narrator: Apart from  algae and worms,</i>
###2217 <i> Ryan doesn't put  too much emphasis</i>
###2219 <i> on stockpiling  additional food.</i>
###2222 Ryan Croft: We have about 1,200 pounds
###2223 of food storage.
###2224 On a normal 2,200 calorie per day diet.
###2227 I've only got about 3 to 4 months.
###2229 But you really don't have to stock a lot of things.
###2231 Especially if you have got some
###2233 experience with primitive survival techniques.
###2236 <i> Narrator: Ryan spent four  years in the Air Force</i>
###2239 <i> and learned how to  survive off the land</i>
###2241 <i> with limited  resources.</i>
###2242 Ryan Croft: I lived primitively
###2244 for years, intentionally.
###2245 No power, no running water and
###2248 I lived for a long time.
###2251 We're going to scavenge from our
###2252 local environment,
###2254 to supplement our food storage.
###2256 <i> Narrator: Tonight,  he's taking his boys</i>
###2257 <i> out into the local  woods to show them what</i>
###2260 <i> else he expects them to  do should doomsday come.</i>
###2263 Ryan Croft: One of the lesser and least
###2265 appreciated foods around America
###2267 is the common field mouse;
###2270 full of nutrition.
###2271 If you eat the whole thing,
###2272 the whole little mouse,
###2273 you're gonna have a complete diet.
###2276 <i> Narrator: Field  mice are a</i>
###2277 <i> constantly  renewable resource.</i>
###2279 <i> Each female can give  birth to 83 mice</i>
###2282 <i> in the course  of one year.</i>
###2284 <i> But at roughly  70 calories each,</i>
###2286 <i> in order to meet  minimum recommend</i>
###2288 <i> calorie requirements on  a 100% mouse diet,</i>
###2291 <i> he'd have to consume  17 mice each day.</i>
###2294 <i> So for Ryan it's  extremely important that</i>
###2296 <i> his boys become  skilled mouse hunters.</i>
###2299 Ryan Croft: We're going to demonstrate a Paiute trap.
###2301 You put a little twig in here.
###2303 See my side, where my fingers are?
###2304 That's where you need to apply the pressure.
###2306 <i> Narrator: Ryan is building  a simple deadfall trap</i>
###2309 <i> out of notched sticks  and a heavy rock.</i>
###2311 <i> By tying the bait to the  end of the trigger stick,</i>
###2314 <i> if it's disturbed  it will cause the</i>
###2315 <i> delicately balanced  sticks to collapse,</i>
###2318 <i> and the deadweight  will fall.</i>
###2321 Ryan Croft: All he has to do is sniff on that
###2322 peanut butter a little bit.
###2323 It does not take very much pressure.
###2326 A fraction of an ounce touches that stick
###2329 and we want that little tiny bit of weight
###2331 to trip this off.
###2332 This is a very dense habitat for mice.
###2335 So hook 'em up with the convenience store right here.
###2338 They can check in, but not check out.
###2345 Alright, well there you go.
###2349 Common field mouse and he's dinner.
###2354 All right, guys I brought dinner.
###2358 Corbin: What are we havin'?
###2359 Ryan Croft: Little mouse, little field mouse.
###2360 He didn't feel a thing.
###2362 There's no good way to skin a mouse.
###2364 You pretty much just destroy them if you do.
###2366 We're gonna hammer him out.
###2367 Break his little bones up.
###2369 Front to back, from the head down and
###2371 then we just drop him right into the coals.
###2373 You roll him around a little bit.
###2375 Let him get crispy.
###2376 Ben: So what's the best part to eat?
###2377 Ryan Croft: His head.
###2380 So boys, who's gonna try some mouse?
###2383 Corbin: Not me, I had the worm last time.
###2385 Ryan Croft: Gordy?
###2386 Gordy: I don't think so.
###2387 Ryan Croft: You don't think so.
###2388 You might be hungry someday,
###2389 you might really.
###2390 Gordy: Yeah, I'll do it when I'm really hungry.
###2392 Ryan Croft: All right.
###2393 Ben: I'll try it.
###2394 Ryan Croft: All right.
###2404 Ben: Mmmm.
###2406 Ryan Croft: Charcoal-y, huh?
###2408 Count of three.
###2410 Gordy: One two three.
###2412 Alex: Go.
###2412 You got it, you got it.
###2413 Go 'head, you got it.
###2414 Go 'head, crunch it up.
###2416 It's gone, it's gone, it's gone.
###2417 There you go, there you go.
###2420 Ryan Croft: It's delicious.
###2422 Gordy: Ugh!
###2423 Ryan Croft: A few good tools, plus know-how,
###2425 you can find mice anywhere.
###2427 You'll never go hungry.
###2429 <i> Narrator: Scavenging  enough food to</i>
###2430 <i> survive on in an  apocalypse is one thing;</i>
###2433 <i> keeping it safe from  those who would take</i>
###2434 <i> it from you  is another.</i>
###2437 <i> So Ryan has taken  extreme measures to prepare</i>
###2440 <i> his community to  defend themselves</i>
###2442 <i> to the death,  if necessary.</i>
###2450 <i> Narrator: Ryan Croft and</i>
###2452 <i> his fellow preppers in  Asheville, North Carolina,</i>
###2454 <i> are preparing for the  looming economic collapse</i>
###2456 <i> that Ryan feels  is inevitable.</i>
###2459 Ryan Croft: We're not prepping for ourselves.
###2460 We're going the step beyond;
###2462 we're prepping for our city.
###2464 <i> Narrator: Ryan fears  his determination to</i>
###2465 <i> stay in the city and  help his neighbors will</i>
###2467 <i> put him in the path  of violent looters.</i>
###2470 <i> So Ryan wants every  prepper in his group to</i>
###2473 <i> be sufficiently armed.</i>
###2474 Ryan Croft: I think we should all be armed.
###2476 If you're armed,
###2477 it changes the game completely.
###2479 More arms works better than less arms.
###2483 <i> Narrator: But Ryan's not  content with what's on the</i>
###2485 <i> market, so he's looking  to create a custom weapon</i>
###2488 <i> specifically to suit  a prepper's needs.</i>
###2491 Ryan Croft: I took the best of the AK-47
###2493 and combined it with the logistical system
###2496 of the AR-15.
###2498 <i> Narrator: The AK-47 is  generally considered</i>
###2501 <i> durable, cheap,  and easy to use,</i>
###2504 <i> but an inferior  weapon to the AR-15,</i>
###2509 <i> which is generally  more expensive.</i>
###2512 <i> Ryan thought if he could  combine the best aspects</i>
###2514 <i> of each gun, he'd have the  perfect prepper weapon.</i>
###2519 Ryan Croft: This is Joshua Mark One.
###2520 I named it after a general Joshua,
###2522 my favorite biblical character.
###2524 Ah, the general pretty much that secured the
###2526 Promised Land for the Israelites.
###2527 This is my very first gun that I built.
###2530 It's sort of the closest thing a man
###2531 can get to having a child, I think.
###2534 Cause it's just a little bunch of parts
###2535 and you bring it together.
###2536 You breathe life into it
###2537 and it's magical, you know?
###2539 This weapon is perfect for, ah,
###2545 I would say for American prepper,
###2547 but really just for America.
###2549 Period.
###2551 Alex: Covering!
###2559 Ryan Croft: We're prepared to do
###2561 everything that's necessary to survive.
###2564 We choose to try and save as many lives as we can.
###2567 Frontal!
###2568 Number one advice I have for America?
###2571 Be flexible.
###2572 Widen your mind, broaden your
###2575 capabilities adapt and overcome.
###2581 <i> Narrator: Ryan,  the experts at</i>
###2582 <i> Practical Preppers  commend you for</i>
###2584 <i> your community  action plan.</i>
###2586 <i> By rallying your  friends and neighbors</i>
###2588 <i> you will establish  a system that</i>
###2590 <i> mutually benefits  everyone.</i>
###2592 Ryan Croft: Thank you.
###2594 <i> Narrator: Your varied  and non-conventional</i>
###2596 <i> food sources are  clever and efficient.</i>
###2599 <i> However you may  have trouble</i>
###2600 <i> feeding your  family of seven.</i>
###2602 <i> We recommend you look  into expanding your</i>
###2604 <i> stockpile of traditional  foods with long shelf life.</i>
###2609 Ryan Croft: Understood, I don't disagree.
###2611 However, if we fully develop our
###2613 Spirulina tech, I think we'll be just fine.
###2617 <i> Narrator: To determine  how long you could</i>
###2619 <i> initially survive  a catastrophe,</i>
###2621 <i> Practical Preppers has  scored your preps in</i>
###2623 <i> five categories of  20 points each.</i>
###2627 <i> Food: 14 out  of 20 points.</i>
###2630 <i> Needing to walk half  a mile to collect</i>
###2632 <i> water is impractical  and could be dangerous:</i>
###2635 <i> 9 out of 20 points.</i>
###2637 <i> Shelter: 13 out  of 20 points.</i>
###2641 <i> Security: 15 out  of 20 points.</i>
###2644 <i> Your community approach  to helping neighbors</i>
###2646 <i> and sharing your  Spirulina gives you</i>
###2648 <i> 12 x-factor points.</i>
###2651 <i> Overall, you get  a 63 out of 100.</i>
###2654 <i> You have ten months  initial survival time.</i>
###2658 Ryan Croft: Well my family have deeply
###2660 appreciated the assessment.
###2663 You check us out.
###2664 If the world will give us another year
###2667 I think we'll be doubly, triply impressive.
###2672 We've made a lot of really good progress.
###2674 Not in every way that we want to,
###2675 but in very significant ways.
###2678 Our Spirulina is doing quite well.
###2680 It's very thick, it's ready for harvesting.
###2683 And we've posted a lot of videos on YouTube
###2686 showing what we've done and how we've done it,
###2689 so that we can help more people that
###2691 are also trying to prepare.
###2695 <i> Narrator: In spite of  the recent recession and</i>
###2697 <i> European debt crisis,  most economists believe</i>
###2700 <i> a near-term depression  is unlikely,</i>
###2702 <i> and the odds of a global  collapse that would result</i>
###2705 <i> in a severe breakdown  of society are remote.</i>
