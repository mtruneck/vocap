13
0:1:4,37 --> 0:1:9,14
Ratcliffe, et al,  reporting in the
Proceedings of the Natioanal Academy of


14
0:1:9,14 --> 0:1:14,1
Sciences claimed to have produced a
multi-celled organism from single-celled


15
0:1:14,1 --> 0:1:18,44
brewer's yeast - you know, the stuff beer
is made of.  There's gotta be a good


16
0:1:18,44 --> 0:1:21,14
science experiment involved then right?


17
0:1:21,14 --> 0:1:23,92
Christie Wilcox, of Scientific American,
wrote about the paper in her Science


18
0:1:23,92 --> 0:1:52,14
Sushi blog:


19
0:1:52,14 --> 0:1:58,15
Selective pressure indeed! What did they
use for selective pressure?  Wait for it!


20
0:1:58,15 --> 0:2:28,31
Wilcox explains:


21
0:2:28,31 --> 0:2:35,49
Ya - real gentle like.  If we head on over to
the original paper, which is available here,


22
0:2:35,49 --> 0:2:40,54
we find that the researchers used good ol'
gravity to turn a single-cell critter into a


23
0:2:40,54 --> 0:2:45,31
multicelled critter. Now as we all know,
gravity doesn't do that. So how exactly


24
0:2:45,31 --> 0:2:49,61
did they use gravity to accomplish what it
normally doesn't do?  Well let's just say


25
0:2:49,61 --> 0:3:2,16
they were little more aggressive in their
use of gravity:


26
0:3:2,16 --> 0:3:8,43
That's right, 60 times in the centrifuge at
100 G's!!!!!


27
0:3:8,43 --> 0:3:13,65
100 times the force of gravity caused the
single cells to cluster together into


28
0:3:13,65 --> 0:3:38,89
snowflake-like groups.


29
0:3:38,89 --> 0:3:43,78
In other words, the yeast clusters that
survived the centrifuge don't survive as


30
0:3:43,78 --> 0:3:49,52
well in real life.  But their characteristics
allow them to survive better... in a


31
0:3:49,52 --> 0:3:57,16
centrifuge.  So this "evolution" of
multicelled organisms (if that's what you


32
0:3:57,16 --> 0:4:2,81
want to call them) just requires 60 rounds
in a centrifuge, at 100 g's, and voila! You


33
0:4:2,81 --> 0:4:7,24
have multicellular life!  So, which came
first, the multicelled organism, or the


34
0:4:7,24 --> 0:4:11,21
centrifuge? According to the latest
scientific research, the centrifuge came


35
0:4:11,21 --> 0:4:12,53
first!


36
0:4:12,53 --> 0:4:16,74
[swoosh] 
1 pound of Brewer's yeast $8


37
0:4:16,74 --> 0:4:21,2
1 laboratory centrifuge, $2,500


38
0:4:21,2 --> 0:4:28,1
lab services to spin yeast in the
centrifuge at 100 g's, $200 per hour.


39
0:4:28,1 --> 0:4:34,4
Making multicelled life that took no
intelligence to make, priceless.


40
0:4:34,4 --> 0:4:38,81
There are some forms of life money can't
buy. For everything else, there's


41
0:4:38,81 --> 0:4:40,78
mastercard.
[swoosh]


42
0:4:40,78 --> 0:4:45,9
Furthermore, the researchers noticed the
involvement of cell death with the


43
0:4:45,9 --> 0:4:49,95
reproduction of these alleged multicelled
organisms.  Obviously this has nothing to


44
0:4:49,95 --> 0:4:54,99
do with real-world multi-celled orgnanisms
which involve reproduction by giving rise


45
0:4:54,99 --> 0:5:0,97
to living cells.  But that aside, even if the
researchers have produced a multi-celled


46
0:5:0,97 --> 0:5:6,0
organism, all they've done is shown that it
took intelligence to make it, and the


47
0:5:6,0 --> 0:5:10,74
intelligent designers even admitted in the
article itself, that their multicelled life will


48
0:5:10,74 --> 0:5:16,29
not survive as well as the single-celled
yeast in the real world.  In other words,


49
0:5:16,29 --> 0:5:22,17
natural selection will weed out the
"multicelled yeast".  This is completely in


50
0:5:22,17 --> 0:5:26,43
line with one of the many points I made in
my "Natural selection" rant, that


51
0:5:26,43 --> 0:5:32,13
single-celled organisms will be favoured
by natural selection, therefore natural


52
0:5:32,13 --> 0:5:36,8
selection cannot be the guiding force for
evolution, because it would weed out


53
0:5:36,8 --> 0:5:42,76
multicelled organisms, like us, thus
inverting the evolutionary tree of life.  


54
0:5:42,76 --> 0:5:46,67
In the words of Dr. Duane Gish,
"It's amazing what an unbeliever must


55
0:5:46,67 --> 0:5:49,22
believe to be an unbeliever"


56
0:5:49,22 --> 0:5:53,22
Wilcox was quite correct in stating that
the creationary thinkers would say that


57
0:5:53,22 --> 0:5:57,5
the origins of the first multicelled
organism, and the first life, require a


58
0:5:57,5 --> 0:6:4,64
Creator.  This latest research only serves
to demonstrate that fact in multiple ways.


59
0:6:4,64 --> 0:6:10,61
Whadya know, Jesus was right about
Creation - 2,000 years ago.  Hmmm....I


60
0:6:10,61 --> 0:6:14,52
wonder what else He was right about?
Hmmm?


61
0:6:14,52 --> 0:6:19,7
Marcelo Gleiser, of Dartmouth College,
wrote an NPR blog entitled "Why do so


62
0:6:19,7 --> 0:6:23,97
many have trouble with evolution?" in
which he asked a series of provocative,


63
0:6:23,97 --> 0:6:32,3
and frankly leading questions.
For example, he said:


64
0:6:32,3 --> 0:6:37,57
Really? And what fossil evidence would
that be pray tell?  From the Cambrian,


65
0:6:37,57 --> 0:6:42,74
right through quarternary, we find fossils
of organisms that have not changed!  The


66
0:6:42,74 --> 0:6:45,94
coelacanth first appears in the fossil
record - according to your evolutionary


67
0:6:45,94 --> 0:6:52,16
timescale, 407 MILLION years ago - yet it
is still around today, unchanged.  Same


68
0:6:52,16 --> 0:6:55,62
with the Ediacaran fossils of Mistaken
Point, Newfoundland - we find fossils of


69
0:6:55,62 --> 0:7:0,66
what sure looks like a sea pen, and the
fossil trails of sea anenomes.  How do we


70
0:7:0,66 --> 0:7:4,42
know what they are? Cause they're still
around today. Same thing with


71
0:7:4,42 --> 0:7:10,6
Lepisosteus, Arnia, Heliobatis, and
knightia, as well as the palm fronds from


72
0:7:10,6 --> 0:7:16,3
the green river formation - all around
today. Nothing has changed.  I could give


73
0:7:16,3 --> 0:7:20,94
you probably hundreds of examples like
this, but you get the point. What we see in


74
0:7:20,94 --> 0:7:25,5
the fossil record is stasis, and extinction -
neither of which help evolution, but


75
0:7:25,5 --> 0:7:30,0
certainly do fit the Genesis account of
Creation, and judgment in a worldwide


76
0:7:30,0 --> 0:7:31,8
flood.


77
0:7:31,8 --> 0:7:41,12
Gleiser claimed these fossils are 


78
0:7:41,12 --> 0:7:46,43
Hogwash.  How many dozens of examples
would you like of "carefully dated" fossils


79
0:7:46,43 --> 0:7:53,2
that later on were re-dated because the
"careful dating" didn't give the age the


80
0:7:53,2 --> 0:8:0,24
evolutionary scientists wanted?  Hmmmm?
Skull 1470 was a classic example, using


81
0:8:0,24 --> 0:8:4,68
dozens of dating tests, confirming one
another - until the fossil was determined


82
0:8:4,68 --> 0:8:8,97
to have been another age based on
evolutionary assumptions - at which point


83
0:8:8,97 --> 0:8:13,7
a whole pile more careful dating was
conducted thus proving the "new" date.


84
0:8:13,7 --> 0:8:17,88
Radiometric dating doesn't date the
fossils - evolutionary assumptions date


85
0:8:17,88 --> 0:8:19,95
the fossils, end of discussion.


86
0:8:19,95 --> 0:8:35,6
Gleiser went on:


87
0:8:35,6 --> 0:8:39,31
Again, apparently Gleiser is unaware of
the facts, so allow me to enlighten.


88
0:8:39,31 --> 0:8:44,6
Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a
change in the population of the bacteria -


89
0:8:44,6 --> 0:8:50,16
the resistant bacteria was already there,
there was no "evolution."  This was


90
0:8:50,16 --> 0:8:54,84
demonstrated by the discovery of bodies
from Franklin expedition to the Canadian


91
0:8:54,84 --> 0:8:59,62
High Arctic, in 1845. After getting
stranded in the Arctic, the entire crew


92
0:8:59,62 --> 0:9:4,31
died one by one, and some of the bodies
were buried on Beechey Island.  These


93
0:9:4,31 --> 0:9:9,6
bodies were exhumed in the 1980's, and
bacteria from the intestines of the bodies


94
0:9:9,6 --> 0:9:15,3
were discovered to be resistant to
antibiotics!  This was some 140 YEARS


95
0:9:15,3 --> 0:9:21,2
before antibiotics were even invented!
Obviously, the resistant bacteria already


96
0:9:21,2 --> 0:9:28,27
existed, thus there is no "evolution" going
on here. Antibiotics are simply killing off


97
0:9:28,27 --> 0:9:34,4
the bacteria that are susceptible, leaving
behind a population of bacteria which are


98
0:9:34,4 --> 0:9:39,88
less evolved, because you've now lost
some of the variation within that


99
0:9:39,88 --> 0:9:42,79
population - you killed them off!


100
0:9:42,79 --> 0:9:54,74
Gleiser then levels a criticism against
Creationary thinkers:


101
0:9:54,74 --> 0:9:59,99
HOGWASH!  Not only has he leveled this
criticism against myself, he has also


102
0:9:59,99 --> 0:10:5,49
leveled it against the founding fathers of
the sciences, who, like myself, considered


103
0:10:5,49 --> 0:10:10,29
it God's calling on their lives to search
out and understand the Created world.


104
0:10:10,29 --> 0:10:20,49
You know, people like Newton, Pasteur,
Kepler, Boyle, Pascal, Babbage, Joule,


105
0:10:20,49 --> 0:10:26,3
Faraday, Maxwell, Sedgwick, Owen, and
numerous other fathers of the modern


106
0:10:26,3 --> 0:10:31,0
sciences.  Then there's modern scientists
like Dr. Raymond Damadian - the inventor


107
0:10:31,0 --> 0:10:34,96
of the MRI, Dr. Keith Wanser, professor of
physics at Cal state and author of 48


108
0:10:34,96 --> 0:10:39,37
published papers and 7 US patents. Or
Dr. Jonathan Sanford, co-inventor of the


109
0:10:39,37 --> 0:10:43,59
"Gene gun", or Dr. Robert Herrmann,
retired professor of mathematics at the


110
0:10:43,59 --> 0:10:47,77
US Naval Academy who ranks in the top
2% of in the production of peer reviewed


111
0:10:47,77 --> 0:10:53,5
papers, including over a dozen
peer-reviewed papers directly related to


112
0:10:53,5 --> 0:10:59,19
his General Intelligent Design model.
Obviously, Gleiser's criticism is just plain


113
0:10:59,19 --> 0:11:1,16
untrue.


114
0:11:1,16 --> 0:11:6,75
This has nothing to do with whether or
not I like evolution Mr. Gleiser, this has


115
0:11:6,75 --> 0:11:12,28
everything to do with THE TRUTH, to
which evolutionary theory seems to have


116
0:11:12,28 --> 0:11:14,49
a strange allergy.


117
0:11:14,49 --> 0:11:19,27
[Scary, dramatic music]


118
0:11:19,27 --> 0:11:25,92
Wahoo! Mail for me?


119
0:11:25,92 --> 0:11:30,48
[Scary, dramatic music]


120
0:11:30,48 --> 0:11:34,25
Once again Genesis Week was in the top
ten most talked about shows in Science


121
0:11:34,25 --> 0:11:37,87
and Technology on YouTube, thanks to
everyone who watched, and those who


122
0:11:37,87 --> 0:11:41,75
were brave enough to comment.  Lawilson
kicked things off with more of his


123
0:11:41,75 --> 0:12:7,58
delusional rants:


124
0:12:7,58 --> 0:12:13,19
Lawilson has flown off the handle like
this, many, many times, throwing out a


125
0:12:13,19 --> 0:12:17,57
rash of  false accusations, and again 
demonstrating that he didn't even


126
0:12:17,57 --> 0:12:25,43
understand what I said. Joe Taylor had
nothing to do with the Nova Scotia tracks


127
0:12:25,43 --> 0:12:33,27
- I said *I* did the research.  And anybody
who knows Joe Taylor knows that he is a


128
0:12:33,27 --> 0:12:39,68
highly-religious tea-totaller in the extreme,
so frankly your slanderous accusations of


129
0:12:39,68 --> 0:12:45,66
his being a drunk is, utterly ridiculous!  I'm
trying to be polite here in my wording,


130
0:12:45,66 --> 0:12:51,3
which is extremely difficult because your
remarks are SO ludicrous!  How could you


131
0:12:51,3 --> 0:12:54,51
even say this publically, knowing that
people who know Joe Taylor personally


132
0:12:54,51 --> 0:13:0,43
are going to read your remarks and point
out your foolishness?   You have yet to


133
0:13:0,43 --> 0:13:3,92
demonstrate how the tracks I have
discussed are "fabricated," and as for


134
0:13:3,92 --> 0:13:8,56
Baugh's "fabricated" tracks, have you
forgotten that those were excavated from


135
0:13:8,56 --> 0:13:14,74
underneath 18 inches of solid rock, which
was broken up and removed in front of


136
0:13:14,74 --> 0:13:21,9
dozens of eye witnesses. In fact, usually
Baugh was standing there, watching, and


137
0:13:21,9 --> 0:13:25,62
not even being the one digging.  Hundreds
of eye witnesses over the years will bear


138
0:13:25,62 --> 0:13:31,32
testimony to this, and you have just called
all of them frauds and liars as well.  Lance,


139
0:13:31,32 --> 0:13:35,68
I keep telling you, and keep hoping that
one day you will learn not to embarrass


140
0:13:35,68 --> 0:13:40,13
yourself, flying off the handle like this,
hurling around such ridiculous,


141
0:13:40,13 --> 0:13:47,4
unfounded accusations.  So far, it appears
you still have not learned your lesson.


142
0:13:47,4 --> 0:13:51,29
When will you learn that when you do
this, the only who winds up looking bad,


143
0:13:51,29 --> 0:13:53,84
is you? 


144
0:13:53,84 --> 0:13:57,39
There were a number of noteworthy and
very interesting comments left on the last


145
0:13:57,39 --> 0:15:3,48
program, to which I have nothing to add! 


146
0:15:3,48 --> 0:15:8,37
A couple of interesting comments were
left in discussion by IloveYouViruses and


147
0:15:8,37 --> 0:15:31,11
TheScienceFoudation:


148
0:15:31,11 --> 0:15:38,67
Thank you, and I agree!  The problem I run
into is what words should I use? For


149
0:15:38,67 --> 0:15:44,35
example, I agree that extinction is an
assumption, but the point being that even


150
0:15:44,35 --> 0:15:48,51
if that assumption is correct, it doesn't
help evolution, so I play by the


151
0:15:48,51 --> 0:15:53,41
evolutionary rules to show that it still
doesn't support evolution.  As for the


152
0:15:53,41 --> 0:15:56,92
progression of time allegedly evident in
the fossil order, thanks for mentioning


153
0:15:56,92 --> 0:16:2,61
this because nowhere do I mean to imply
that there is a fossil order. My own


154
0:16:2,61 --> 0:16:7,12
first-hand research all over North America
has shown me over and over again that


155
0:16:7,12 --> 0:16:11,7
there is NO fossil order.
Which brings us to


156
0:16:11,7 --> 0:16:30,25
TheScienceFoundation's interesting reply
to what IloveYouViruses had to say:


157
0:16:30,25 --> 0:16:34,13
I actually partly agree with
TheScienceFoundation here; the problem


158
0:16:34,13 --> 0:16:39,62
is the alleged sorting is non-existent.  Yes,
there is a partial sorting where typically


159
0:16:39,62 --> 0:16:43,7
you find one type of organism with
another, but even that tends to be


160
0:16:43,7 --> 0:16:48,21
inconsistent, and it's actually
inconclusive.  For example, Coelacanths


161
0:16:48,21 --> 0:16:52,7
and whales live together today, in the
same environment. We also find them


162
0:16:52,7 --> 0:16:56,54
both in the fossil record, but to the best
of my knowledge, they have never been


163
0:16:56,54 --> 0:17:1,41
found together in the fossil record.  So the
absence or presence of a fossil in a


164
0:17:1,41 --> 0:17:6,71
specific layer really has nothing to do with
whether or not the organism was there.  I


165
0:17:6,71 --> 0:17:10,24
could give you literally dozens of
examples like this, where we know the


166
0:17:10,24 --> 0:17:14,6
organism was present, but yet not
preserved in the layer.  Thus the alleged


167
0:17:14,6 --> 0:17:20,38
fossil sequence is invalidated on this one
point alone.  I would suggest that the


168
0:17:20,38 --> 0:17:34,58
evidence for hydrodynamics is in the
sedimentology.


169
0:17:34,58 --> 0:17:42,57
[laughing] Uh - in what way, pray tell, is
removing ratings "dishonest?"  In fact,


170
0:17:42,57 --> 0:17:46,89
throwing around false accusations, like
falsely accusing me of being dishonest, is


171
0:17:46,89 --> 0:17:51,67
dishonest.  I turned off ratings because of
anonymous abuse. If people want to


172
0:17:51,67 --> 0:17:56,48
abuse me, they can leave a comment.
None of this cowardly anonymous ratings


173
0:17:56,48 --> 0:18:0,63
stuff - you stick your name on your
comment and be accountable for your


174
0:18:0,63 --> 0:18:5,34
words and actions.  Because I want the
whole world to see who the abusers are,


175
0:18:5,34 --> 0:18:8,3
and just what kind of people they are.


176
0:18:8,3 --> 0:18:40,53
Vegavis had some more to say on the
Horton bluff trackways:


177
0:18:40,53 --> 0:18:46,61
Again, thanks for writing in, but I need to
ask a few questions: Found a new


178
0:18:46,61 --> 0:18:53,53
specimen of what? More of the fossil
footprints? Or Baropezia itself?  Where is


179
0:18:53,53 --> 0:19:0,26
the fossil foot of baropezia to compare to
the fossil footprints?  The footprints of


180
0:19:0,26 --> 0:19:4,99
what is claimed to be baropezia elsewhere
do not even vaguely resemble the Horton


181
0:19:4,99 --> 0:19:10,81
Bluff tracks.  In fact the original reports
specifically mention the absence of claw


182
0:19:10,81 --> 0:19:14,6
impressions at the Horton Bluff tracks. As
I mentioned, and anyone can go to the


183
0:19:14,6 --> 0:19:19,84
trackway and verify for themselves, the
tracks were clearly made by a bipedal


184
0:19:19,84 --> 0:19:25,87
animal.  The tracks perfectly match a
known creature - the ostrich.  However,


185
0:19:25,87 --> 0:19:33,5
that interpretation is rejected in favour of
an unknown organism - baropezia.  


186
0:19:33,5 --> 0:20:6,0
Lastly, TubeNotMe brought up another
interesting example of fossil bird tracks:


187
0:20:6,0 --> 0:20:8,19
Thanks for writing in.


188
0:20:8,19 --> 0:20:11,5
Well that's enough for this week - thanks
for making Genesis Week one of the most


189
0:20:11,5 --> 0:20:15,49
