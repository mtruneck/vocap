###17 SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: Whenever Pakistan comes on the
###19 news these days, the context is either floods, the Taliban,
###23 political assassinations, or violence at the hands of
###25 suicide bombers.
###28 We wanted to see it for ourselves, so we got on a
###30 plane and flew to Peshawar.
###32 It's a city right on the border of the tribal areas, a
###35 lawless region sandwiched between
###36 Afghanistan and Pakistan.
###39 Back in 2006, we came to the region to film a story about
###43 the largest illegal gun market in the world in a town called
###46 Darra Adamkhel.
###47 [GUNSHOTS]
###48 [GUNSHOTS]
###49 [LAUGHTER]
###51 SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: Our host was a guy named Naeem
###52 Afridi who was the Director of Protocol for the provincial
###55 government.
###56 
###61 SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: On the recent trip, we
###62 called Naeem again.
###63 And as soon as we met, he explained that things in
###65 Pakistan and Peshawar, specifically, had spiraled
###68 downward into a cesspool of militancy and fundamentalism.
###71 
###82 SUROOSH ALVI: Now, I was here four years ago, and it was
###84 totally different.
###85 And now, everyone's scared.
###88 
###96 SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: We drove to the Pearl Continental
###98 Hotel, the same place we stayed on our last visit.
###101 SUROOSH ALVI: So, that's the driveway
###102 coming into the hotel.
###105 There was a car that drove in very fast, and there was a
###107 bomb blast here six months ago.
###110 And four years ago, those little walls didn't exist.
###115 And there are about 25 to 30 armed
###118 guards inside this compound.
###121 I feel like I'm the only person staying here.
###122 
###126 SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: After 9/11, the US bombed the hell
###128 out of Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban.
###130 The remaining soldiers scrambled over the porous
###132 border into the tribal areas of Pakistan, and that's where
###135 they started to plot their comeback.
###137 What a lot of people don't realize is that because of all
###139 of this, a second Taliban movement was formed called the
###142 Pakistani Taliban or Tehrik-i-Taliban.
###145 SUROOSH ALVI: You know, there's two Talibans--
###147 the one in Afghanistan and the one in Pakistan.
###149 And the ones here have created a lot of fear in Peshawar.
###156 This is the office for The News.
###157 It's one of the largest newspapers in the country.
###159 We're here to meet Rahimullah Yusefzai.
###162 He is the most respected journalist in the country.
###165 He was the first guy to ever go visit with the Taliban and
###168 interview them.
###169 And he was also the last guy to ever get an interview with
###172 Osama bin Laden, who he's interviewed twice.
###174 And he is regarded as the foremost
###177 authority on the Taliban.
###179 And he's made some time to meet with us.
###182 Could you explain the difference between the Afghani
###184 Taliban and the Pakistan Taliban?
###186 RAHIMULLAH YUSEFZAI: The Pakistani Taliban were
###188 inspired by the Afghan Taliban.
###192 They have the same values.
###195 The Pakistani Taliban look to the Afghan Taliban for
###198 leadership.
###199 The Pakistani Taliban were happy to fight in Afghanistan
###203 until the Pakistan government, under US pressure, started
###208 action against them in Pakistan.
###211 Then they started looking inwards.
###213 They began fighting the Pakistani state.
###216 So I think their main battle now is in Pakistan.
###219 
###223 SUROOSH ALVI: So, buddy, this road looks familiar.
###226 We've been on it before when we went to
###228 Darra to the gun markets.
###229 NAEEM AFRIDI: Yeah.
###230 NARRATOR: And so why can't we go into the tribal areas?
###233 
###244 SUROOSH ALVI: We're driving up to a site where there was a
###247 bomb blast.
###248 The Taliban tried to kill the police.
###251 It's a checkpoint.
###253 I'm standing here on the border of the tribal areas,
###256 and just four kilometers that way is the gun market where we
###259 filmed four years ago.
###261 That area has been taken over by the Taliban.
###264 And these guys here, they battle with the Taliban on a
###268 regular basis.
###268 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###270 
###281 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###281 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###284 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###286 
###288 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###289 
###292 SUROOSH ALVI: So they're saying, in Darra, they do
###294 knock off this gun, but this one has come from abroad.
###298 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###298 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE].
###299 OK, it's definitely locked.
###301 I won't shoot the farmer on the tractor.
###303 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]?
###305 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###306 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###306 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###308 
###310 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###312 So this was built in 1986.
###315 This is a very important piece of history here because this
###318 is where all the problems stem from.
###320 When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, they came in.
###324 And there was a lot of leftover Russian artillery.
###327 And since that time, this Kalashnikov culture has been
###330 pervading Pakistan.
###332 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###334 
###362 SUROOSH ALVI: So overall, it's pretty heavy
###364 vibes around here.
###365 They're scanning suspicious-looking people and
###369 trying to find guns, explosives, and what not.
###371 There was a single bomb blast that blew up the market over
###374 there, the mosque behind me, the armored vehicle over
###377 there, and the police station, and about 50 people died.
###381 One of the guys who died was wearing
###383 this bulletproof jacket.
###385 And the soldier who died, they buried him right here.
###390 Yikes.
###391 That freaks me out.
###392 There's all kinds of shit falling out of it.
###396 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###397 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###398 
###414 SUROOSH ALVI: So the Taliban target the police here because
###417 they're saying that they're infidels, they're anti-Muslim,
###420 they're friends of the West, they're collaborators.
###424 And that's why they become targets, when in reality,
###427 they're practicing Muslims.
###428 It's ridiculous.
###430 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]?
###431 
###435 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###436 
###442 SUROOSH ALVI: Good luck.
###443 Naeem's telling me it's time to go.
###445 I'm pushing my luck here.
###447 OK.
###448 RAHIMULLAH YUSEFZAI: I think that suicide bombing and the
###452 use of IEDs--
###454 Improvised Explosive Devices--
###456 that's the two most effective weapons now available with
###461 militants in this part of the world.
###462 The young people who agree to become suicide bombers, I
###467 think their numbers are really big.
###470 They can even afford to send bombers to attack
###474 insignificant targets.
###476 They're all willing to die.
###478 I remember one of the Afghan Taliban commanders, he claimed
###482 once that he had about 5,000 suicide bombers.
###487 The way they recruit people, the way they brainwash them,
###492 that is very effective.
###494 In fact, I remember once receiving a phone call from
###498 Qari Hussain, the master trainer of suicide bombers.
###503 So he said, I can turn a young man into a suicide bomber in
###508 half an hour.
###509 And I said, how come?
###510 He said, it's very easy because there is so much anger
###514 among Muslims against America, against the allies of the
###519 Western countries like the Pakistani
###521 state, Pakistani army.
###523 He said, our villages have been attacked.
###526 Our women and children have been killed.
###528 So we can very easily motivate these families to supply us
###536 fighters and suicide bombers.
###539 And he then told me that you are an old man, but if you sit
###544 with me for half an hour, I can turn you
###548 into a suicide bomber.
###551 So he's so confident of what he is doing.
###553 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###573 SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: The Taliban puts
###574 out videos like this.
###575 They used to be available in shops around Peshawar, but
###577 when I went to buy them, all I could find was Bollywood and
###580 pornography.
###581 So I got my local cameraman to put out some feelers, and a
###583 militant ended up delivering a flash drive to my hotel that
###586 was full of these videos glorifying suicide bombers and
###589 successful missions and executions.
###591 
###598 As if dealing with the Taliban, widespread
###600 fundamentalism, and suicide bombers wasn't enough for
###602 Pakistan, in July, 2010, terrible monsoons hit the
###606 country, and 20% of it ended up underwater.
###610 In a matter of months, more than 20 million people got
###612 fucked by floods of biblical proportions.
###615 The water cut a swath through the country, from the very top
###617 to the very bottom.
###619 
###632 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###634 
###650 SUROOSH ALVI: This is the aftermath of the floods, this
###652 total devastation.
###654 There's nothing left.
###656 They've had no aid.
###657 They have no money.
###658 No one's helping them.
###659 They're trying to pick up the pieces of their lives, pick up
###662 these bricks and rebuild their homes.
###665 They literally have nothing.
###667 
###670 SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: To get a better sense of how the
###671 government was responding to the floods, I arranged to meet
###674 with the Bureau Chief of the Daily Times of
###675 Peshawar, Iqbal Khattak.
###677 
###706 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###709 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###710 
###715 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###716 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###717 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###717 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###720 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###724 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###725 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###728 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###730 
###735 SUROOSH ALVI: So all these homes around me have been
###737 rebuilt by the Taliban.
###738 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###739 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###741 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###742 
###753 SUROOSH ALVI: So where the government fails, the Taliban
###756 is stepping in and helping the rebuilding process, thereby
###762 engendering goodwill and winning the hearts and minds
###765 of these people.
###766 How many other towns are there like this?
###769 NAEEM AFRIDI: So many.
###769 SUROOSH ALVI: So many.
###771 And it's all the same story.
###772 NAEEM AFRIDI: The same story.
###773 
###776 SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: The US government's response to the
###777 floods was to donate about $150 million in
###780 aid, which is great.
###782 But it's nothing compared to what the US is spending on
###784 fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan--
###786 about $165 million every day.
###790 Part of that money is spent on remote-controlled Predator
###792 drone planes used to bomb militants not just inside of
###795 Afghanistan but also inside of Pakistan.
###799 The drone plane attacks piss off not only the Taliban and
###801 al-Qaeda, but everyone, from civilians to the government.
###805 They often miss their targets, killing innocent people.
###807 They're a blatant violation of the nation's sovereignty.
###811 In 2008, Iqbal Kjattak met with the Taliban commander
###814 Baitullah Mehsud, who explained to him the effects
###817 of the American drone attacks.
###818 
###869 SUROOSH ALVI: We've been in Peshawar for a couple days,
###870 and I'm just trying to wrap my brain around everything that's
###874 going on here.
###875 There's many groups and factions and splinter groups.
###879 Within the Taliban itself, there's probably 30 militant
###881 groups under the Tehrik-i-Taliban umbrella
###885 organization.
###886 Then there's al-Qaeda.
###889 We are just driving into a neighborhood
###892 called University Town.
###893 It is where Osama bin Laden used to live, and it's where
###897 he started al-Qaeda.
###898 It's the birthplace of al-Qaeda.
###901 And from here, we're going to go meet with the
###904 Jamaat-e-Islami, who are a very established, conservative
###909 Islamic movement.
###911 And they are al-Qaeda friendly.
###915 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###916 
###1015 SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: The more people I interviewed, the
###1016 clearer it became.
###1017 The Taliban and al-Qaeda in Pakistan have abandoned the
###1020 holier pursuit of imposing strict
###1022 Islamic law in the region.
###1024 For now they're simply young, pissed off, and vengeful
###1027 beyond belief.
###1028 RAHIMULLAH YUSEFZAI: You need religion to motivate people.
###1031 In Sharia, or Islamic, law, jihad, these slogans are very
###1036 handy, very effective.
###1039 But I think that the suicide bombings, even the attacks
###1044 against the security forces, the police, the Pakistani
###1047 state, the ruling party politicians,
###1051 is an act of revenge.
###1054 It's just plain revenge.
###1056 There would be people who would be radicalized because
###1059 of the policies of the state, because of this alliance with
###1063 the US, because of American policies in the region.
###1066 That's why, even if there's a solution in Pakistan, I don't
###1072 think the problem will end because there's a fallout on
###1076 Pakistan of whatever is happening in Afghanistan.
###1081 SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: So after nine years and $370
###1082 billion spent fighting against the Taliban in Afghanistan,
###1087 the US still seems to be pretty far off from
###1089 accomplishing much besides pissing off the entire region.
###1093 And all this is inspiring a whole new generation of
###1095 militants and suicide bombers in Pakistan, a country that
###1099 has been considered for years to be a key ally
###1101 in the War on Terror.
###1102 So it seems to me, they've got a bigger problem now.
