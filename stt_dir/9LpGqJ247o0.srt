1
0:0:4,38 --> 0:0:8,27
>> WILLIAMS: Tonight's gathering of the candidates,
this Special Edition of Rock Center comes


2
0:0:8,27 --> 0:0:16,48
after what is already been a long campaign.
It started in Iowa, continued in New Hampshire,


3
0:0:16,48 --> 0:0:23,95
but after a bruising battle in South Carolina,
the fights come now here to Florida. The first


4
0:0:23,95 --> 0:0:31,71
big state to have a big say in the GOP contest.
The issues? A stubborn ten percent unemployment


5
0:0:31,71 --> 0:0:37,86
rate, for seniors, real concerns about the
future of Medicare and Social Security, high


6
0:0:37,86 --> 0:0:43,32
foreclosure rates, education, immigration,
and ninety miles of the Florida coast, Cuba.


7
0:0:43,32 --> 0:0:43,32
That and more.


8
0:0:43,32 --> 0:0:45,18
>> ANNOUNCER: Times, from the University of
South Florida in Tampa Bay, here now Brian


9
0:0:45,18 --> 0:0:45,35
Williams.


10
0:0:45,35 --> 0:1:0,97
>> WILLIAMS: Good evening to you. Welcome
to the University of South Florida. The audience


11
0:1:0,97 --> 0:1:8,89
is in place. The candidates are here. Lord
knows, everyone knows each other by now. And


12
0:1:8,89 --> 0:1:15,289
so we get under way tonight as again this
Republican primary battle finds itself at


13
0:1:15,289 --> 0:1:21,389
a critical stage. And the Voters here in Florida
and across the country are dialed in and paying


14
0:1:21,389 --> 0:1:25,729
attention. We want to get right too it so
a quick explanation of our rules. Again, you


15
0:1:25,729 --> 0:1:32,2
are familiar by now, sixty seconds for answers,
thirty seconds for rebuttals or follow-ups


16
0:1:32,2 --> 0:1:36,829
at the moderators discretion. We've asked
our invited guests here this evening to withhold


17
0:1:36,829 --> 0:1:42,74
their applause any verbal reactions to what
they hear on stage so as to ensure this is


18
0:1:42,74 --> 0:1:48,639
about the four candidates here tonight and
what they have to say. As for topics, it's


19
0:1:48,639 --> 0:1:54,369
a wide-open evening, so let's begin. First
of all, since we last gathered, three of you


20
0:1:54,369 --> 0:2:2,42
on stage have enjoyed victories, an unprecedented
moment in the modern era, three separate candidates,


21
0:2:2,42 --> 0:2:7,979
three separate victories. Congratulations
to you. In all three contests, the voters


22
0:2:7,979 --> 0:2:14,98
made it clear to pollsters and elsewhere that
electability was a crucial element to them,


23
0:2:14,98 --> 0:2:22,28
a crucial argument this year. And so, speaker
Gingrich, on electability to begin with, your


24
0:2:22,28 --> 0:2:28,59
rival, your opponent on this stage, Governor
Romney, was out today calling you erratic,


25
0:2:28,59 --> 0:2:34,33
a failed leader, and warning that your nomination
for this party could perhaps result in what


26
0:2:34,33 --> 0:2:40,63
he called an "October surprise a day." So
given the fact that he went after you today


27
0:2:40,63 --> 0:2:44,819
on this topic of electability, your response
tonight, Mr. Speaker?


28
0:2:44,819 --> 0:2:49,82
>> GINGRICH: Well, in 1980, when Ronald Reagan
started the year about 30 points behind Jimmy


29
0:2:49,82 --> 0:2:57,4
Carter and when the Republican establishment
described his economic ideas as "voodoo economics,"


30
0:2:57,4 --> 0:3:2,28
Reagan just cheerfully went out and won the
debate, won the nomination, and won the general


31
0:3:2,28 --> 0:3:6,63
election carrying more states than Herbert
Hoover carried -- than Roosevelt carried against


32
0:3:6,63 --> 0:3:12,21
Herbert Hoover. I would suggest that a solid
conservative who believes in economic growth


33
0:3:12,21 --> 0:3:16,6
through lower taxes and less regulation, who
believes in an American energy program, who


34
0:3:16,6 --> 0:3:21,3
believes in a strong national defense, and
who has the courage to stand up to the Washington


35
0:3:21,3 --> 0:3:26,99
establishment, may make the Washington establishment
uncomfortable, but is also exactly the kind


36
0:3:26,99 --> 0:3:31,89
of bold, tough leader the American people
want, they're not sending somebody to Washington


37
0:3:31,89 --> 0:3:36,15
to manage the decay. They're sending somebody
to Washington to change it, and that requires


38
0:3:36,15 --> 0:3:38,94
somebody who's prepared to be controversial
when necessary.


39
0:3:38,94 --> 0:3:45,7
>> WILLIAMS: And about your problems, your
departure from the speakership in the '90s,


40
0:3:45,7 --> 0:3:50,18
what's the case you make to the American people
and voters in Republican primary contests


41
0:3:50,18 --> 0:3:52,6
about how you've changed, Mr. Speaker?


42
0:3:52,6 --> 0:3:55,14
>> GINGRICH: Well, first of all, the case
I make is that, when I was speaker, we had


43
0:3:55,14 --> 0:3:59,42
four consecutive balanced budgets, the only
time in your lifetime, Brian, that we've had


44
0:3:59,42 --> 0:4:4,13
four consecutive balanced budgets. Most people
think that's good. We were down to 4.2 percent


45
0:4:4,13 --> 0:4:8,569
unemployment; 11 million new jobs were created.
Most people think that's good. We reformed


46
0:4:8,569 --> 0:4:12,31
welfare. And two out of three people went
to work or went to school. People think that's


47
0:4:12,31 --> 0:4:17,489
good. I left the speakership after the 1998
election because I took responsibility for


48
0:4:17,489 --> 0:4:20,73
the fact that our results weren't as good
as they should be. I think that's what a leader


49
0:4:20,73 --> 0:4:25,82
should do. I took responsibility, and I didn't
want to stay around, as Nancy Pelosi has.


50
0:4:25,82 --> 0:4:30,1
I wanted to get out and do other things. I
founded four small businesses. And I'm very


51
0:4:30,1 --> 0:4:34,98
comfortable that my four years as speaker,
working with a Democratic president, achieved


52
0:4:34,98 --> 0:4:38,83
the kind of conservative values that most
Republicans want to have in a president.


53
0:4:38,83 --> 0:4:42,97
>> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, for his part,
the speaker said about you that were dancing


54
0:4:42,97 --> 0:4:49,32
on eggs during this campaign, a good salesman
with a weak product. And even Chris Christie,


55
0:4:49,32 --> 0:4:54,23
one of the most popular politicians in this
country, speaking on your behalf, said this


56
0:4:54,23 --> 0:5:0,3
weekend your challenge is "going to be how
to connect with people." Same question to


57
0:5:0,3 --> 0:5:1,18
you about electability.


58
0:5:1,18 --> 0:5:5,2
>> ROMNEY: Well, I think this is going to
come down to a question of leadership. I think


59
0:5:5,2 --> 0:5:8,85
as you choose the president of the United
States, you're looking for a person who can


60
0:5:8,85 --> 0:5:12,81
lead this country in a very critical time,
lead the free world, and the free world has


61
0:5:12,81 --> 0:5:17,3
to lead the entire world. I think it's about
leadership, and the Speaker was given an opportunity


62
0:5:17,3 --> 0:5:21,5
to be the leader of our party in 1994. And
at the end of four years, he had to resign


63
0:5:21,5 --> 0:5:26,71
in disgrace. Now, in the 1970s, he came to
Washington. I went to work in my first job


64
0:5:26,71 --> 0:5:32,68
in the 1970s at the bottom level of a consulting
firm. In the 1990s, he had to resign in disgrace


65
0:5:32,68 --> 0:5:37,79
from this job as Speaker.I had the opportunity
to go off and run the Olympic winter games.


66
0:5:37,79 --> 0:5:42,97
In the 15 years after he left the speakership,
the Speaker has been working as an influence


67
0:5:42,97 --> 0:5:48,889
peddler in Washington. And during those 15
years, I helped turn around the Olympics,


68
0:5:48,889 --> 0:5:53,25
helped begin a very successful turnaround
in the state of Massachusetts. The Speaker


69
0:5:53,25 --> 0:5:57,68
-- when I was fighting against cap and trade,
the Speaker was sitting down with Nancy Pelosi


70
0:5:57,68 --> 0:6:2,36
on a sofa encouraging it. When I was fighting
to say that the Paul Ryan plan to solve Medicare


71
0:6:2,36 --> 0:6:7,35
was bold and right, he was saying that it
was right wing social engineering. So we have


72
0:6:7,35 --> 0:6:12,0
very different perspectives on leadership,
and the kind of leadership that our conservative


73
0:6:12,0 --> 0:6:16,14
movement needs not just to get elected, but
to get the country right.


74
0:6:16,14 --> 0:6:17,4
>> WILLIAMS: Mr. Speaker?


75
0:6:17,4 --> 0:6:20,51
>> GINGRICH: Well, look, I'm not going to
spend the evening trying to chase Governor


76
0:6:20,51 --> 0:6:26,0
Romney's misinformation. We'll have a site
at Newt.org by tomorrow morning. We'll list


77
0:6:26,0 --> 0:6:28,76
everything -- he just said at least four things
that are false. I don't want to waste the


78
0:6:28,76 --> 0:6:32,41
time on them. I think the American public
deserve a discussion about how to beat Barack


79
0:6:32,41 --> 0:6:37,4
Obama, the American public deserves a discussion
of what we would do about the economy. And


80
0:6:37,4 --> 0:6:42,21
I just think this is the worst kind of trivial
politics. I mean, he said at least four things


81
0:6:42,21 --> 0:6:47,5
that were false. We have an ad in which both
John McCain and Mike Huckabee in 2007 and


82
0:6:47,5 --> 0:6:51,71
2008 explain how much they think Governor
Romney can't tell the truth. I just suggest


83
0:6:51,71 --> 0:6:55,229
people look at them. Don't listen to me, don't
believe me. Just look at the ad with Mike


84
0:6:55,229 --> 0:6:59,46
Huckabee and Senator McCain and you will understand
exactly what you just saw.


85
0:6:59,46 --> 0:7:4,61
>> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, to your electability,
let's talk about the southern base of the


86
0:7:4,61 --> 0:7:10,479
GOP. Among those who describe themselves as
very conservative, only one in five have gone


87
0:7:10,479 --> 0:7:13,969
your way. How is that going to bode well for
the longer campaign?


88
0:7:13,969 --> 0:7:17,38
>> ROMNEY: Had a great record, as you know,
in New Hampshire. The New Hampshire voters


89
0:7:17,38 --> 0:7:21,62
overwhelmingly supported me. Actually, among
Republicans in New Hampshire, I got the biggest


90
0:7:21,62 --> 0:7:25,81
support that we have seen among Republicans,
even including Ronald Reagan, that far back.


91
0:7:25,81 --> 0:7:29,88
So I'm pleased I will be able to connect well
with our Republican base. But let's go back


92
0:7:29,88 --> 0:7:33,639
to what the Speaker mentioned with regards
to leadership, and that is -- I mean, we don't


93
0:7:33,639 --> 0:7:38,53
have to take my word for the facts. They're
accurate. I will point out that they are accurate.


94
0:7:38,53 --> 0:7:43,8
But the truth is that the members of his own
team, his congressional team, after his four


95
0:7:43,8 --> 0:7:50,33
years of leadership, they moved to replace
him. They also took a vote, and 88 percent


96
0:7:50,33 --> 0:7:55,77
of Republicans voted to reprimand the Speaker,
and he did resign in disgrace after that.This


97
0:7:55,77 --> 0:8:0,729
was the first time in American history that
a Speaker of the House has resigned from the


98
0:8:0,729 --> 0:8:6,699
House. And so that was the judgment rendered
by his own people as to his leadership. Look,


99
0:8:6,699 --> 0:8:10,27
don't forget at the end of the Speaker's term
as Speaker, his approval rating was down to


100
0:8:10,27 --> 0:8:16,41
18 percent. We suffered historic losses after
his four years in office. And I'll make this


101
0:8:16,41 --> 0:8:22,71
other point, which is we just learned today
that his contract with Freddie Mac was provided


102
0:8:22,71 --> 0:8:28,37
by the lobbyists at Freddie Mac. I don't think
we can possibly retake the White House if


103
0:8:28,37 --> 0:8:32,68
the person who's leading our party is the
person who was working for the chief lobbyist


104
0:8:32,68 --> 0:8:39,87
of Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac was paying Speaker
Gingrich $1,600,000 at the same time Freddie


105
0:8:39,87 --> 0:8:43,12
Mac was costing the people of Florida millions
upon millions of dollars.


106
0:8:43,12 --> 0:8:47,7
>> WILLIAMS: Do you realize last week, Governor,
you said that -- you complained that too much


107
0:8:47,7 --> 0:8:53,37
of your time on stage lately has been spent
on negativity vis-a-vis the other candidates?


108
0:8:53,37 --> 0:8:58,68
You pledged to spend your time going after
the incumbent president, yet here we are again.


109
0:8:58,68 --> 0:9:2,1
>> ROMNEY: I'll tell you why, which is I learned
something from that last contest in South


110
0:9:2,1 --> 0:9:7,589
Carolina, and that was I had incoming from
all directions, was overwhelmed with a lot


111
0:9:7,589 --> 0:9:11,14
of attacks. And I'm not going to sit back
and get attacked day in and day out without


112
0:9:11,14 --> 0:9:15,3
returning fire. I would like not to have the
kind of attacks that came against me. There


113
0:9:15,3 --> 0:9:19,74
were two ads run by Speaker Gingrich. Outside
fact- checking groups said these ads were


114
0:9:19,74 --> 0:9:24,89
false, and yet they continue to run them,
and one by his campaign, and one by a PAC,


115
0:9:24,89 --> 0:9:28,83
in his benefit. And I know he can't control
that, but those ads were pretty heavy on me.


116
0:9:28,83 --> 0:9:33,18
So I'm going to point out things I think people
need to know. It was Republicans who replaced


117
0:9:33,18 --> 0:9:39,43
him in the House, voted to reprimand him.
And it was the head lobbyist of Freddie Mac


118
0:9:39,43 --> 0:9:44,339
with whom he had a contract at a time when
Floridians were suffering as a result in part


119
0:9:44,339 --> 0:9:45,36
of Freddie Mac.


120
0:9:45,36 --> 0:9:48,66
>> WILLIAMS: Mr. Speaker, 30 seconds before
I move on.


121
0:9:48,66 --> 0:9:53,63
>> GINGRICH: Now, wait a second. I mean, he
just went on and on and on, making a whole


122
0:9:53,63 --> 0:9:57,12
series of allegations. First of all, he may
have been a good financier; he's a terrible


123
0:9:57,12 --> 0:10:5,31
historian. The fact is, the vote on the Ethics
Committee was in January of 1997. I asked


124
0:10:5,31 --> 0:10:10,74
the Republicans to vote yes because we had
to get it behind us. The Democrats had filed


125
0:10:10,74 --> 0:10:16,25
84 ethics charges for a simple reason: We
had taken control of the House after 40 years,


126
0:10:16,25 --> 0:10:21,39
and they were very bitter. And the fact is,
on every single ethics charge of substance


127
0:10:21,39 --> 0:10:25,48
that was dismissed in the end, the only thing
we did wrong is we had one lawyer written


128
0:10:25,48 --> 0:10:29,64
by letters -- I mean, written one letter,
and the one letter was in error. I didn't


129
0:10:29,64 --> 0:10:34,56
pay a fine. I paid the cost of going through
the process of determining it was wrong. I


130
0:10:34,56 --> 0:10:38,94
left two years later, and, frankly, we were
right to get it behind us because the tax


131
0:10:38,94 --> 0:10:43,79
cut that led to economic growth, the four
balanced budgets all came after that vote.


132
0:10:43,79 --> 0:10:47,29
So you have all this stuff just jumbled up.
Apparently your consultants aren't very good


133
0:10:47,29 --> 0:10:51,899
historians. What you ought to do is stop and
look at the facts. And the fact is, we won


134
0:10:51,899 --> 0:10:56,55
the House for the third time in 1998, but
the margin wasn't big enough. So I am the


135
0:10:56,55 --> 0:11:1,279
only speaker up to that point since the 1920s
who had led the Republican Party to three


136
0:11:1,279 --> 0:11:6,31
consecutive victories. By the way, in 2006
when you chaired the Governors Association,


137
0:11:6,31 --> 0:11:10,339
we lost governorships. And in the four years
that you were governor, we lost seats in the


138
0:11:10,339 --> 0:11:14,87
Massachusetts legislature. So I think as a
party builder, the 20 years I spent building


139
0:11:14,87 --> 0:11:17,7
the House Republican Party stands pretty good
as an example of leadership.


140
0:11:17,7 --> 0:11:23,2
>> WILLIAMS: Senator Santorum, you have labeled
this choice as being between an erratic and


141
0:11:23,2 --> 0:11:30,95
a moderate. You come in here tonight with
one victory in Iowa. Where is your path to


142
0:11:30,95 --> 0:11:31,82
the top here?


143
0:11:31,82 --> 0:11:36,27
>> SANTORUM: Well, I think if you've learned
anything about this election, that any type


144
0:11:36,27 --> 0:11:41,92
of prediction is going to be wrong. The idea
that this was a two-person race has been an


145
0:11:41,92 --> 0:11:47,79
idea that has been in fashion now for eight
months, and it's been wrong about eight times.


146
0:11:47,79 --> 0:11:52,76
And so we're looking at this race trying to
paint a positive vision for our country. You


147
0:11:52,76 --> 0:11:57,29
ask my path to victory. My path to victory
is to tell the people of Florida and tell


148
0:11:57,29 --> 0:12:1,839
the people of this country of someone who's
here that presents a very clear contrast with


149
0:12:1,839 --> 0:12:6,6
the president of the United States, someone
that will make him the issue in this race,


150
0:12:6,6 --> 0:12:11,16
not the Republican candidate, someone who
has a track record of being a strong conservative,


151
0:12:11,16 --> 0:12:15,47
someone who has a vision, a bold vision to
reach out to the voters that I reached out


152
0:12:15,47 --> 0:12:19,99
and was successful in getting when I ran for
the Senate in Pennsylvania twice, a state


153
0:12:19,99 --> 0:12:25,399
we haven't won for the presidency since 1988.
I won it twice, once in a year where George


154
0:12:25,399 --> 0:12:30,58
Bush lost the state by five and I won it by
six. How did I do it? I had plans out there


155
0:12:30,58 --> 0:12:34,839
that included everybody, plans like I have
today, talking about manufacturing, talking


156
0:12:34,839 --> 0:12:39,61
about things that -- that are touchstones
with the Reagan Democrats that provided that


157
0:12:39,61 --> 0:12:44,269
49-state win. We talked about faith. We talked
about family. We talked about jobs. We talked


158
0:12:44,269 --> 0:12:50,63
about limited government. And that message
was one that connected in a state -- well,


159
0:12:50,63 --> 0:12:53,959
just like Florida, that's one of those key
states that we're going to win. And that sets


160
0:12:53,959 --> 0:12:58,31
me apart, really, from anybody else on this
stage as someone who's been victorious with


161
0:12:58,31 --> 0:13:0,25
a strong, principled conservative message.


162
0:13:0,25 --> 0:13:4,149
>> WILLIAMS: And yet, Senator, you are former
Senator Santorum, having lost your home state


163
0:13:4,149 --> 0:13:5,19
by 18 points.


164
0:13:5,19 --> 0:13:9,33
>> SANTORUM: Yeah, well, if I was the only
guy that lost an election that year in Pennsylvania,


165
0:13:9,33 --> 0:13:12,81
that would be maybe a big statement, but our
gubernatorial candidate lost by more than


166
0:13:12,81 --> 0:13:17,38
I did. We lost five congressional seats. And
it was an historic loss in our statehouse.


167
0:13:17,38 --> 0:13:21,89
It was a meltdown year. We lost 23 out of
33 senators. And probably unlike a lot of


168
0:13:21,89 --> 0:13:24,899
other candidates, when you're running in an
election year that you know you're running


169
0:13:24,899 --> 0:13:30,39
against a headwind, a lot of folks crouch
down, they get out of the way of the wind


170
0:13:30,39 --> 0:13:36,5
and try to sneak in. I stood tall, stood for
what I believed in, talked about issues like


171
0:13:36,5 --> 0:13:40,61
the threat of Iran on the horizon, talked
about the need to reform Social Security and


172
0:13:40,61 --> 0:13:45,12
Medicare, talked about the issues that, well,
now we're all talking about today, as I did


173
0:13:45,12 --> 0:13:49,26
at a time when nobody wanted to hear that
message. I also was running with a president


174
0:13:49,26 --> 0:13:53,88
who was sitting at about 35 percent favorable,
and I was standing by him and trying to reform


175
0:13:53,88 --> 0:13:57,99
Social Security, and trying to fight the war
and win the war in Iraq, and I stand by that.


176
0:13:57,99 --> 0:14:2,329
And one of the things I figured out when I
was running in that tough election year, there's


177
0:14:2,329 --> 0:14:6,94
one thing worse than losing an election, and
that's not standing for the principles that


178
0:14:6,94 --> 0:14:7,519
you hold.


179
0:14:7,519 --> 0:14:12,649
>> WILLIAMS: Congressman Paul, there is no
denying you have an enthusiastic base support


180
0:14:12,649 --> 0:14:17,99
-- base of support. We could hear them outside
tonight. Yet there was that recent interview,


181
0:14:17,99 --> 0:14:24,3
you were asked if while campaigning you envision
yourself in the Oval Office, and you said,


182
0:14:24,3 --> 0:14:29,67
"Not really, but I think it's a possibility."
So that begs the question about your path


183
0:14:29,67 --> 0:14:36,29
and when you will give an honest answer about
perhaps your third-party plans going forward.


184
0:14:36,29 --> 0:14:40,2
Are you in this regardless of the outcome
to your right here on this stage?


185
0:14:40,2 --> 0:14:43,5
>> PAUL: Well, unlike others, maybe they sit
around and daydream about being in the White


186
0:14:43,5 --> 0:14:47,2
House. I just don't sit around daydreaming
about it, but I'm in a race, I'm in a good


187
0:14:47,2 --> 0:14:52,47
race. You talk about electability. Why don't
we take on the first three states and take


188
0:14:52,47 --> 0:14:56,89
everybody 30 years and under? I'm doing pretty
darned well. I'm winning that vote. But what


189
0:14:56,89 --> 0:15:2,579
about if you compare my name to Obama? I do
quite well, if not better, than the rest.


190
0:15:2,579 --> 0:15:8,959
So, to say that there has only been three
races, and talk about not being electable,


191
0:15:8,959 --> 0:15:13,47
I think is a bit of a stretch. As a matter
of fact, the delegates haven't even been appointed


192
0:15:13,47 --> 0:15:18,1
in Iowa yet. I mean, quite frankly, we have
a pretty good chance of getting a good sum


193
0:15:18,1 --> 0:15:22,149
of those because of the organization. We only
had a straw vote. I mean, this argument on


194
0:15:22,149 --> 0:15:28,5
who won, it was a straw vote. I mean, the
delegates is what counts. But I do want to


195
0:15:28,5 --> 0:15:34,43
address the earlier discussion that you had
about 1997. I had been out of Congress for


196
0:15:34,43 --> 0:15:40,399
12 years, and I went back in '96 and arrived
there in '97. It was chaotic, let me tell


197
0:15:40,399 --> 0:15:45,329
you. It was a mess, and it was a mess for
12 years. And Newt had a big job on his hands,


198
0:15:45,329 --> 0:15:51,24
but he really had to attack the conservatives.
He did it boldly. And quite frankly, I think


199
0:15:51,24 --> 0:15:58,1
the reason -- he didn't not run for Speaker,
you know, two years later. He didn't have


200
0:15:58,1 --> 0:16:2,57
the votes. That was what the problem was.
So this idea that he voluntarily reneged and


201
0:16:2,57 --> 0:16:5,93
he was going to punish himself because we
didn't do well in the election, that's just


202
0:16:5,93 --> 0:16:6,9
not the way it was.


203
0:16:6,9 --> 0:16:11,529
>> WILLIAMS: Let me come at it this way. If
Newt Gingrich emerges from the GOP primary


204
0:16:11,529 --> 0:16:15,77
process as the nominee of the party, do you
go your own way?


205
0:16:15,77 --> 0:16:19,1
>> PAUL: Well, I have done a lot of that in
my lifetime.


206
0:16:19,1 --> 0:16:23,81
>> WILLIAMS: I should be more specific. Will
you run as a third- party candidate?


207
0:16:23,81 --> 0:16:28,49
>> PAUL: I have no plans to do that, no intention.
And when I have been pressed on it, and they


208
0:16:28,49 --> 0:16:34,37
asked me why, and I said, I don't want to.
But I haven't been an absolutist. When I left


209
0:16:34,37 --> 0:16:39,899
Congress, I didn't have plans on going back,
but I did after 12 years. I went back to medicine.


210
0:16:39,899 --> 0:16:43,73
So, no, I don't have any plans to do that.
No.


211
0:16:43,73 --> 0:16:46,79
>> WILLIAMS: Would you support a Newt Gingrich
as nominee of the GOP?


212
0:16:46,79 --> 0:16:52,12
>> PAUL: Well, he keeps hinting about attacking
the Fed, and he talks about gold. Now if I


213
0:16:52,12 --> 0:16:56,129
could just change him on foreign policy, we
might be able to talk business.


214
0:16:56,129 --> 0:16:56,79
>> [LAUGHTER]


215
0:16:56,79 --> 0:17:1,899
>> WILLIAMS: Speaker Gingrich, are you willing
to adjust to pick up an endorsement from Texas?


216
0:17:1,899 --> 0:17:7,329
>> GINGRICH: Well, I got one on Friday from
Governor Perry, which I liked a lot as a starting


217
0:17:7,329 --> 0:17:12,49
point. So I like endorsements from Texas.
And Congressman Paul is right. There's an


218
0:17:12,49 --> 0:17:15,589
area -- I think what he has said about the
Federal Reserve and what he has said about


219
0:17:15,589 --> 0:17:20,5
the importance of monetary policy, the proposal
I've issued for a gold commission, which hearkens


220
0:17:20,5 --> 0:17:25,76
back to something that he and Jesse Helms
helped develop, on which he served on in 1981,


221
0:17:25,76 --> 0:17:29,6
and the fact that we have people of the caliber
of Lew Lehrman and Jim Grant, who have agreed


222
0:17:29,6 --> 0:17:32,95
they would chair such a commission, I think
they're areas we can work on. There are places


223
0:17:32,95 --> 0:17:36,84
we disagree very deeply. Iran is a good example.
But there are places -- you know, you build


224
0:17:36,84 --> 0:17:41,26
a coalition by trying to find ways you can
work together, and frankly we could work together


225
0:17:41,26 --> 0:17:44,16
a lot more than either one of us could work
with Barack Obama.


226
0:17:44,16 --> 0:17:48,9
>> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, a question you
know is coming because of what you have set


227
0:17:48,9 --> 0:17:55,4
in motion for tomorrow when you release one
year's tax returns and your estimates for


228
0:17:55,4 --> 0:18:2,83
2011. We know it's not a matter of producing
them. You said during the McCain vetting process


229
0:18:2,83 --> 0:18:8,429
you turned over 23 years which you had at
the ready because, to quote you, you're something


230
0:18:8,429 --> 0:18:17,32
of a packrat. So, prior to tomorrow, can you
tell us tonight what's in there that's going


231
0:18:17,32 --> 0:18:22,41
to get people talking? What's in there that's
going to be controversial? What's in there


232
0:18:22,41 --> 0:18:24,72
that you may find yourself defending?


233
0:18:24,72 --> 0:18:31,89
>> ROMNEY: No surprises, Brian. The most extensive
disclosure that I made was the financial disclosure


234
0:18:31,89 --> 0:18:36,59
requirements under the law. We each had to
do that, and I laid out what my assets are


235
0:18:36,59 --> 0:18:40,65
and where they are, and people have been looking
at that. It's very similar to what it was


236
0:18:40,65 --> 0:18:48,35
four years ago. And so my income tax will
show that that's where the profits and rewards


237
0:18:48,35 --> 0:18:53,6
came. The real question is not so much my
taxes, but the taxes of the American people.


238
0:18:53,6 --> 0:18:56,76
The real question people are going to ask
is, who's going to help the American people


239
0:18:56,76 --> 0:19:1,69
at a time when folks are having real tough
times? And that's why I put forward a plan


240
0:19:1,69 --> 0:19:6,74
to eliminate the tax on savings for middle
income Americans. Anyone making under $200,000


241
0:19:6,74 --> 0:19:11,58
a year, I would eliminate the tax on interest,
dividends and capital gains. People need help


242
0:19:11,58 --> 0:19:16,49
to be able to save their money. I'll also
bring the corporate tax rate down to 25 percent


243
0:19:16,49 --> 0:19:22,799
as quickly as possible and then begin a process
of reshaping the entire tax code. It's far


244
0:19:22,799 --> 0:19:28,26
too complex, it's far too intrusive, it's
far too great. I would like to lower the rates,


245
0:19:28,26 --> 0:19:32,64
broaden the base, akin to what we saw in the
Bowles-Simpson plan, which, by the way, the


246
0:19:32,64 --> 0:19:36,9
president commissioned and then simply brushed
aside. We need to go back to that, get our


247
0:19:36,9 --> 0:19:40,78
rates down, and get a pro-growth tax policy
in this country.


248
0:19:40,78 --> 0:19:46,37
>> WILLIAMS: So, across this country tomorrow,
when people learn the details of the tax return


249
0:19:46,37 --> 0:19:50,84
you release -- and, of course, you'll be under
pressure to release more years after that


250
0:19:50,84 --> 0:19:57,63
-- nothing will stick out, nothing will emerge
that will be talked about by this time tomorrow


251
0:19:57,63 --> 0:19:57,81
night?


252
0:19:57,81 --> 0:20:1,27
>> ROMNEY: Oh, I'm sure people will talk about
it. I mean, you'll see my income, how much


253
0:20:1,27 --> 0:20:7,21
taxes I've paid, how much I've paid to charity.
You'll see how complicated taxes can be. But


254
0:20:7,21 --> 0:20:11,669
-- but I pay all the taxes that are legally
required and not a dollar more. I don't think


255
0:20:11,669 --> 0:20:16,45
you want someone as the candidate for president
who pays more taxes than he owes. So I'll


256
0:20:16,45 --> 0:20:20,429
-- I'll point out that that's the case. And
will there will discussion? Sure. Will it


257
0:20:20,429 --> 0:20:25,12
be an article? Yeah. But is it entirely legal
and fair? Absolutely. I'm proud of the fact


258
0:20:25,12 --> 0:20:29,35
that I pay a lot of taxes. And the fact is,
there are a lot of people in this country


259
0:20:29,35 --> 0:20:34,539
that pay a lot of taxes. I'd like to see our
tax rate come down and focus on growing the


260
0:20:34,539 --> 0:20:38,46
country, getting people back to work. That's
our problem in this country right now. We've


261
0:20:38,46 --> 0:20:42,78
got a lot of people out of work. Let's let
them start paying taxes because they got jobs


262
0:20:42,78 --> 0:20:42,99
again.


263
0:20:42,99 --> 0:20:44,7
>> WILLIAMS: Speaker Gingrich, what will satisfy
you?


264
0:20:44,7 --> 0:20:48,33
>> GINGRICH: Well, first of all, he said the
other day when he indicated he was going to


265
0:20:48,33 --> 0:20:51,549
release it, that was the right thing to do.
It's actually a tradition his father started


266
0:20:51,549 --> 0:20:56,2
in 1967. I think it's the right thing to do.
The biggest thing I think will be -- and I


267
0:20:56,2 --> 0:21:0,52
think you indicated the other day that you
pay something like a 15 percent marginal rate.


268
0:21:0,52 --> 0:21:5,2
My position is not to attack him for paying
a 15 percent marginal rate. I have in my tax


269
0:21:5,2 --> 0:21:10,11
proposal an alternative flat tax on the Hong
Kong model, where you get to choose what you


270
0:21:10,11 --> 0:21:15,32
want, and our rate's 15 percent. So I'm prepared
to describe my 15 percent flat tax as the


271
0:21:15,32 --> 0:21:19,95
Mitt Romney flat tax. I'd like to bring everybody
else down to Mitt's rate, not try to bring


272
0:21:19,95 --> 0:21:21,45
him up to some other rate.


273
0:21:21,45 --> 0:21:22,43
>> WILLIAMS: And -- yes, Governor?


274
0:21:22,43 --> 0:21:22,7
>> [CROSSTALK]


275
0:21:22,7 --> 0:21:26,94
>> ROMNEY: Mr. Speaker, is the tax on capital
gains also 15 percent or is it zero?


276
0:21:26,94 --> 0:21:27,39
>> GINGRICH: Zero.


277
0:21:27,39 --> 0:21:30,7
>> ROMNEY: Well, under that -- under that
plan, I'd have paid no taxes in the last two


278
0:21:30,7 --> 0:21:31,279
years.


279
0:21:31,279 --> 0:21:35,1
>> GINGRICH: Well, if that -- and if you created
enough jobs doing that -- it was Alan Greenspan


280
0:21:35,1 --> 0:21:39,91
who first said the best rate, if you want
to create jobs for capital gains, is zero.


281
0:21:39,91 --> 0:21:44,5
My number-one goal is to create a maximum
number of jobs to put the American people


282
0:21:44,5 --> 0:21:46,9
back to work. It's a straightforward argument.


283
0:21:46,9 --> 0:21:50,89
>> WILLIAMS: And, Governor, how about your
father's model of 12 years' worth of returns?


284
0:21:50,89 --> 0:21:55,18
>> ROMNEY: You know, I agree with my dad on
a lot of things, but we also disagree. And


285
0:21:55,18 --> 0:21:58,51
-- and going out with 12 years of returns
is not something I'm going to do. I'm putting


286
0:21:58,51 --> 0:22:3,35
out two years, which is more than anyone else
on this stage. I think it'll satisfy the interests


287
0:22:3,35 --> 0:22:7,559
of the American people to see that I pay my
taxes, where I give my charitable contributions


288
0:22:7,559 --> 0:22:9,29
to, and I think that's the right number.


289
0:22:9,29 --> 0:22:12,75
>> WILLIAMS: More broadly, Governor, just
an aside, have you been surprised at the degree


290
0:22:12,75 --> 0:22:18,89
to which your wealth has become an issue?
You spoke rather forcefully in South Carolina


291
0:22:18,89 --> 0:22:26,64
over the weekend on Saturday night about this,
about the degree to which you've had to defend,


292
0:22:26,64 --> 0:22:28,77
as you put it, your success in business.


293
0:22:28,77 --> 0:22:33,58
>> ROMNEY: Yeah, I knew that was going to
come from the Obama team. I understood that.


294
0:22:33,58 --> 0:22:38,299
We see that on the left. I was surprised to
see people in the Republican Party pick up


295
0:22:38,299 --> 0:22:43,19
the weapons of the left and start using them
to attack free enterprise. I think those weapons


296
0:22:43,19 --> 0:22:47,22
will be used against us. I think it's very
unfortunate. I will not apologize for having


297
0:22:47,22 --> 0:22:53,23
been successful. I did not inherit what my
wife and I have, nor did she. What we have


298
0:22:53,23 --> 0:22:58,7
-- what -- what I was able to build, I built
the old-fashioned way, by earning it, by working


299
0:22:58,7 --> 0:23:2,94
hard. And I was proud of the fact that we
helped create businesses that grew, that employed


300
0:23:2,94 --> 0:23:7,97
people. And these are not just high-end financial
jobs. We helped start Staples, for instance.


301
0:23:7,97 --> 0:23:12,419
It employs 90,000 people. These are middle-
income people. There are entry-level jobs,


302
0:23:12,419 --> 0:23:16,15
too. I'm proud of the fact that we helped
people around the country, Bright Horizons


303
0:23:16,15 --> 0:23:21,679
children centers, the Sports Authority, Steel
Dynamics, a new steel company. These employ


304
0:23:21,679 --> 0:23:26,98
people, middle-income people. And the nature
of America is individuals pursuing their dreams


305
0:23:26,98 --> 0:23:31,34
don't make everyone else poorer; they help
make us all better off. And so I'm not going


306
0:23:31,34 --> 0:23:36,12
to apologize for success or apologize for
free enterprise. I believe free enterprise


307
0:23:36,12 --> 0:23:40,25
is one of the things that -- that we have
to reinvigorate in this country if we want


308
0:23:40,25 --> 0:23:41,53
to get people working again.


309
0:23:41,53 --> 0:23:45,53
>> WILLIAMS: Senator Santorum, Governor Romney
has said -- and he said again tonight -- he


310
0:23:45,53 --> 0:23:50,47
expected these attacks from the other side.
He's been taking fire as he would from the


311
0:23:50,47 --> 0:23:54,71
Democrats from the group on this stage. That
means you. That includes you.


312
0:23:54,71 --> 0:23:56,86
>> ROMNEY: I didn't mean to include...


313
0:23:56,86 --> 0:24:1,3
>> SANTORUM: No, I have -- I have not. I have
not fired at Governor Romney on -- on -- on


314
0:24:1,3 --> 0:24:5,409
his -- his work at Bain Capital. In fact,
I've been maybe unique in that regard that


315
0:24:5,409 --> 0:24:10,53
I haven't. I believe in capitalism. I believe
in free markets. I believe Governor Romney


316
0:24:10,53 --> 0:24:15,53
can go out and -- and earn whatever he can.
And hopefully he creates jobs by earning that


317
0:24:15,53 --> 0:24:19,69
money and investing in companies. My only
question with Governor Romney is that, you


318
0:24:19,69 --> 0:24:23,789
know, to be a great defender of capitalism
and talk about the importance of -- of capitalism


319
0:24:23,789 --> 0:24:29,1
and free markets, and in the case of Bain,
constructive capitalism and destructive capitalism.


320
0:24:29,1 --> 0:24:33,64
My question to Governor Romney and to Speaker
Gingrich, if you believe in capitalism that


321
0:24:33,64 --> 0:24:38,8
much, then why did you support the bailout
of Wall Street, where you had an opportunity


322
0:24:38,8 --> 0:24:44,809
to allow destructive capitalism to work, to
allow a failure of a -- of a system that needed


323
0:24:44,809 --> 0:24:51,25
to fail because people did things that in
capitalism pay -- you pay a price? And we


324
0:24:51,25 --> 0:24:57,919
should have allowed those financial institutions
to go through the bankruptcy process, and


325
0:24:57,919 --> 0:25:2,96
we would have had resulted not what we are
seeing here in Florida with this lengthy recession/depression


326
0:25:2,96 --> 0:25:8,659
of the housing market. You would have seen
the effects of what Governor Romney advocated


327
0:25:8,659 --> 0:25:14,25
for and advocates today at Bain Capital, which
is allowing companies that do not do their


328
0:25:14,25 --> 0:25:19,32
job, cannot be competitive, make mistakes,
to fail and pay the price, instead of having


329
0:25:19,32 --> 0:25:20,96
government come in and prop them up.


330
0:25:20,96 --> 0:25:24,86
>> WILLIAMS: And Speaker Gingrich, just tonight,
two hours ago, in fact, you released your


331
0:25:24,86 --> 0:25:30,51
'06 contract with Freddie Mac. We alluded
to this earlier. Your company was paid $25,000


332
0:25:30,51 --> 0:25:38,69
a month, $300,000 for the year. But it didn't
provide a further explanation of services


333
0:25:38,69 --> 0:25:45,549
for Freddie Mac. Why one year's worth? Governor
Romney today used the expression "work product."


334
0:25:45,549 --> 0:25:49,74
He wants to see your work product, and the
word "lobbying" has been thrown around, and


335
0:25:49,74 --> 0:25:51,309
you strongly disagree with that.


336
0:25:51,309 --> 0:25:54,47
>> GINGRICH: Well, first of all, if you read
the contract -- and we can go back and check


337
0:25:54,47 --> 0:25:58,789
the other years. We had to work through the
process of getting an approval because it


338
0:25:58,789 --> 0:26:4,309
was a confidentiality agreement. But if you
read the contract which we have posted, and


339
0:26:4,309 --> 0:26:8,22
the Center for Health Transformation had to
get permission to post, it says very clearly


340
0:26:8,22 --> 0:26:11,59
supposed to do consulting work. The governor
did consulting work for years. I have never


341
0:26:11,59 --> 0:26:16,51
suggested his consulting work was lobbying.
So let me start right there. There is no place


342
0:26:16,51 --> 0:26:20,48
in the contract that provides for lobbying.
I have never done any lobbying. Congressman


343
0:26:20,48 --> 0:26:24,69
J.C. Watts, who for seven years was the head
of the Freddie Mac Watch Committee, said flatly


344
0:26:24,69 --> 0:26:30,919
he has never been approached by me. The fact
is that Congressman Rick Lazio, who is chairman


345
0:26:30,919 --> 0:26:34,99
of the Housing Subcommittee, said he has never
been approached by me. And the only report


346
0:26:34,99 --> 0:26:40,799
in the newspaper was "The New York Times"
in July of 2008, which said I told the House


347
0:26:40,799 --> 0:26:45,22
Republicans they should vote no, not give
Freddie Mac any money, because it needed to


348
0:26:45,22 --> 0:26:46,37
be reformed. So there's no --


349
0:26:46,37 --> 0:26:46,54
>> [CROSSTALK]


350
0:26:46,54 --> 0:26:48,419
>> WILLIAMS: So you never peddled influence,
as he described tonight?


351
0:26:48,419 --> 0:26:48,679
>> GINGRICH: What?


352
0:26:48,679 --> 0:26:52,18
>> WILLIAMS: You never peddled influence,
as Governor Romney accused you of tonight?


353
0:26:52,18 --> 0:26:56,78
>> GINGRICH: You know, there is a point in
the process where it gets unnecessarily personal


354
0:26:56,78 --> 0:27:2,19
and nasty. And that's sad. The fact is I have
had a very long career of trying to represent


355
0:27:2,19 --> 0:27:6,87
the people of Georgia and, as Speaker, the
people of the United States. I think it's


356
0:27:6,87 --> 0:27:12,929
pretty clear to say that I have never, ever
gone and done any lobbying. In fact, we brought


357
0:27:12,929 --> 0:27:17,799
in an expert on lobbying law and trained all
of our staff. And that expert is prepared


358
0:27:17,799 --> 0:27:23,25
to testify that he was brought in to say here
is the bright line between what you can do


359
0:27:23,25 --> 0:27:27,799
as a citizen and what you do as a lobbyist.
And we consistently, for 12 years, running


360
0:27:27,799 --> 0:27:34,4
four small businesses, stayed away from lobbying,
precisely because I thought this kind of defamatory


361
0:27:34,4 --> 0:27:36,41
and factually false charge would be made.


362
0:27:36,41 --> 0:27:42,15
>> ROMNEY: Well, Mr. Speaker, you were -- on
this stage, at a prior debate, you said you


363
0:27:42,15 --> 0:27:48,44
were paid $300,000 by Freddie Mac for an historian
-- as an historian. They don't pay people


364
0:27:48,44 --> 0:27:55,32
$25,000 a month for six years as historians.
That adds up to about $1.6 million. They weren't


365
0:27:55,32 --> 0:27:57,76
hiring you as an historian. And this contract
proves that you were not an historian. You


366
0:27:57,76 --> 0:27:58,379
were a consultant.


367
0:27:58,379 --> 0:28:0,49
>> GINGRICH: I was a consultant.


368
0:28:0,49 --> 0:28:3,85
>> ROMNEY: It doesn't say that you provided
historical experience, it said that you were


369
0:28:3,85 --> 0:28:9,11
as a consultant. And you were hired by the
chief lobbyist of Freddie Mac, not the CEO,


370
0:28:9,11 --> 0:28:15,8
not the head of public affairs. By the chief
lobbyist at Freddie Mac. You also spoke publicly


371
0:28:15,8 --> 0:28:22,39
in favor of these GSEs, these government-
sponsored entities, at a very time when Freddie


372
0:28:22,39 --> 0:28:26,77
Mac was getting America in a position where
we would have had a massive housing collapse.


373
0:28:26,77 --> 0:28:29,909
You could have spoken out aggressively. You
could have spoken out in a way to say these


374
0:28:29,909 --> 0:28:34,51
guys are wrong, this needs to end. But instead,
you were being paid by them. You were making


375
0:28:34,51 --> 0:28:38,94
over $1 million at the same time people in
Florida were being hurt by millions of dollars.


376
0:28:38,94 --> 0:28:41,82
>> GINGRICH: Well, this is a good example.
As a businessman, you know that the gross


377
0:28:41,82 --> 0:28:46,83
revenue of Bain wasn't your personal income.
We had a company. The company had three offices.


378
0:28:46,83 --> 0:28:52,59
The company was being paid. My share annually
was about $35,000 a year. And the fact is


379
0:28:52,59 --> 0:28:56,159
I offered strategic advice, largely based
on my knowledge of history, including the


380
0:28:56,159 --> 0:29:0,98
history of Washington. Government-sponsored
enterprises include, for example, telephone


381
0:29:0,98 --> 0:29:5,299
cooperatives, rural electric cooperatives,
federal credit unions. There are many different


382
0:29:5,299 --> 0:29:8,809
kinds of government-sponsored enterprises,
and many of them have done very good things.


383
0:29:8,809 --> 0:29:14,59
And in the early years, before some people,
particularly Jim Johnson and other Democrats,


384
0:29:14,59 --> 0:29:17,69
began to change the model you could make a
pretty good argument that in the early years,


385
0:29:17,69 --> 0:29:21,58
those housing institutions were responsible
for a lot of people getting a lot of good


386
0:29:21,58 --> 0:29:21,86
housing.


387
0:29:21,86 --> 0:29:25,14
>> ROMNEY: There's no question about that,
but we're talking about one. We're talking


388
0:29:25,14 --> 0:29:25,83
about Freddie Mac.


389
0:29:25,83 --> 0:29:26,35
>> GINGRICH: Right.


390
0:29:26,35 --> 0:29:29,99
>> ROMNEY: And that one did a lot of bad for
a lot of people. And you were working there


391
0:29:29,99 --> 0:29:32,45
making over $1 million for your entities --


392
0:29:32,45 --> 0:29:32,69
>> [CROSSTALK]


393
0:29:32,69 --> 0:29:34,48
>> GINGRICH: For the entities. As long as
we agree, for the entities.


394
0:29:34,48 --> 0:29:38,59
>> ROMNEY: Owned by you. I don't know whether
100 percent owned by you, but I presume. Owned


395
0:29:38,59 --> 0:29:42,9
by you, over $1.6 million. And you said it
was $300,000. It was $1.6 million. That's


396
0:29:42,9 --> 0:29:43,34
a difference.


397
0:29:43,34 --> 0:29:46,83
>> GINGRICH: So, Mitt, what -- Mitt, what's
the gross revenue of Bain in the years you


398
0:29:46,83 --> 0:29:48,609
were associated with it? What's the gross
revenue?


399
0:29:48,609 --> 0:29:51,739
>> ROMNEY: Very -- very substantial. But I
think it's irrelevant compared to the fact...


400
0:29:51,739 --> 0:29:51,889
>> GINGRICH: No.


401
0:29:51,889 --> 0:29:53,23
>> ROMNEY: ... that you were working for Freddie
Mac.


402
0:29:53,23 --> 0:29:53,66
>> GINGRICH: Wait a second. Wait a second.
Very substantial.


403
0:29:53,66 --> 0:29:54,309
>> ROMNEY: You were working for Freddie...


404
0:29:54,309 --> 0:29:54,659
>> [CROSSTALK]


405
0:29:54,659 --> 0:29:58,45
>> GINGRICH: Did Bain ever do any work with
any company which did any work with the government,


406
0:29:58,45 --> 0:29:58,889
like Medicare...


407
0:29:58,889 --> 0:30:0,1
>> ROMNEY: We didn't -- we didn't do -- we
didn't...


408
0:30:0,1 --> 0:30:0,17
>> GINGRICH: ... Medicaid?


409
0:30:0,17 --> 0:30:2,88
>> ROMNEY: We didn't do any work with the
government. I didn't have an office on K Street.


410
0:30:2,88 --> 0:30:6,299
I wasn't a lobbyist. I didn't -- had never
worked -- I've never worked in Washington.


411
0:30:6,299 --> 0:30:6,68
You were working...


412
0:30:6,68 --> 0:30:7,22
>> GINGRICH: So -- so...


413
0:30:7,22 --> 0:30:10,52
>> ROMNEY: We have congressmen who also say
that you came and lobbied them in favor...


414
0:30:10,52 --> 0:30:11,37
>> GINGRICH: I didn't lobby them.


415
0:30:11,37 --> 0:30:12,8
>> ROMNEY: You have congressmen who say...


416
0:30:12,8 --> 0:30:12,869
>> [CROSSTALK]


417
0:30:12,869 --> 0:30:17,39
>> ROMNEY: ... that you came and lobbied them
with regards to Medicare Part D, at the same


418
0:30:17,39 --> 0:30:17,129
time...


419
0:30:17,129 --> 0:30:17,61
>> GINGRICH: Now, wait. Whoa, whoa.


420
0:30:17,61 --> 0:30:19,96
>> ROMNEY: ... your center was taking in contributions...


421
0:30:19,96 --> 0:30:21,419
>> GINGRICH: You just jumped a long way over
here, friend.


422
0:30:21,419 --> 0:30:25,34
>> ROMNEY: Well, another -- another area of
influence-peddling.


423
0:30:25,34 --> 0:30:32,73
>> GINGRICH: No, not -- now, let me be very
clear, because I understand your technique,


424
0:30:32,73 --> 0:30:38,49
which you used on McCain, you used on Huckabee,
you've used consistently, OK? It's unfortunate,


425
0:30:38,49 --> 0:30:42,96
and it's not going to work very well, because
the American people see through it. I have


426
0:30:42,96 --> 0:30:48,44
always publicly favored a stronger Medicare
program. I wrote a book in 2002 called "Saving


427
0:30:48,44 --> 0:30:53,799
Lives and Saving Money." I publicly favored
Medicare Part D for a practical reason, and


428
0:30:53,799 --> 0:30:58,95
that reason is simple. The U.S. government
was not prepared to give people anything -- insulin,


429
0:30:58,95 --> 0:31:3,0
for example -- but they would pay for kidney
dialysis. They weren't prepared to give people


430
0:31:3,0 --> 0:31:8,22
Lipitor, but they'd pay for open-heart surgery.
That is a terrible way to run Medicare. I


431
0:31:8,22 --> 0:31:11,5
am proud of the fact -- and I'll say this
in Florida -- I'm proud of the fact that I


432
0:31:11,5 --> 0:31:17,49
publicly, openly advocated Medicare Part D.
It has saved lives. It's run on a free enterprise


433
0:31:17,49 --> 0:31:22,97
model. It also included health savings accounts
and it include Medicare alternatives, which


434
0:31:22,97 --> 0:31:27,49
gave people choices. And I did it publicly,
and it is not correct, Mitt -- I'm just saying


435
0:31:27,49 --> 0:31:30,96
this flatly, because you've been walking around
this state saying things that are untrue -- it


436
0:31:30,96 --> 0:31:36,34
is not correct to describe public citizenship,
having public advocacy as lobbying. Every


437
0:31:36,34 --> 0:31:37,83
citizen has the right to do that.


438
0:31:37,83 --> 0:31:38,2
>> ROMNEY: They sure do.


439
0:31:38,2 --> 0:31:39,33
>> GINGRICH: And what I did on behalf of Medicare...


440
0:31:39,33 --> 0:31:39,73
>> ROMNEY: They sure do.


441
0:31:39,73 --> 0:31:43,529
>> GINGRICH: ... I did out in the open, publicly,
and that is my right as a citizen.


442
0:31:43,529 --> 0:31:43,919
>> WILLIAMS: Gentlemen...


443
0:31:43,919 --> 0:31:47,59
>> ROMNEY: Here's why it's a problem, Mr.
Speaker. Here's why it's a problem. And that


444
0:31:47,59 --> 0:31:52,789
is, if you're getting paid by health companies,
if your entities are getting paid by health


445
0:31:52,789 --> 0:31:57,5
companies that could benefit from a piece
of legislation, and you then meet with Republican


446
0:31:57,5 --> 0:32:0,149
congressmen and encourage them to support
that legislation, you can call it whatever


447
0:32:0,149 --> 0:32:3,409
you'd like. I call it influence-peddling.
It is not right. It is not right. You have


448
0:32:3,409 --> 0:32:6,669
a conflict. You are -- you are being paid
by companies at the same time you're encouraging


449
0:32:6,669 --> 0:32:8,509
people to pass legislation which is in their
favor.


450
0:32:8,509 --> 0:32:8,919
>> WILLIAMS: Governor...


451
0:32:8,919 --> 0:32:10,23
>> ROMNEY: This is -- you spent now 15 years
in Washington on K Street. And -- and this


452
0:32:10,23 --> 0:32:10,76
is a real problem, if we're going to nominate
someone who not only had a record of -- of


453
0:32:10,76 --> 0:32:11,14
great distress as the speaker, but that has
worked for 15 years lobbying.


454
0:32:11,14 --> 0:32:11,61
>> WILLIAMS: Gentlemen, we've let this go
because of the state of the race, and a certain


455
0:32:11,61 --> 0:32:12,49
amount of this conversation, I guess, had
to happen. We -- this also has to happen.


456
0:32:12,49 --> 0:32:12,19
We have to go to a break. We'll come back.
We'll talk about foreclosure. We'll talk about


457
0:32:12,19 --> 0:32:12,19
foreign policy. We'll welcome in the other
two gentlemen to this conversation when we


458
0:32:12,19 --> 0:32:12,19
continue from Tampa.


459
0:32:12,19 --> 0:32:12,19
>> [APPLAUSE]


460
0:32:12,19 --> 0:32:12,19
>> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]


461
0:32:12,19 --> 0:32:16,409
>> WILLIAMS: Welcome back to what has already
become an interesting night in Tampa, Florida.


462
0:32:16,409 --> 0:32:22,9
Gentlemen, welcome back to you. And, Senator
Santorum, let's begin this segment with you.


463
0:32:22,9 --> 0:32:27,49
Since we've been nibbling around the edges
of the foreclosure crisis, since, what, 40


464
0:32:27,49 --> 0:32:32,7
percent of homeowners in this state are underwater,
53 percent of the homes in Tampa, Florida,


465
0:32:32,7 --> 0:32:40,179
are worth less today than before this crisis.
Was it too easy? Did vehicles of the U.S.


466
0:32:40,179 --> 0:32:42,75
government make it too easy to own a home
in America?


467
0:32:42,75 --> 0:32:46,27
>> SANTORUM: Well, the answer, unfortunately,
is yes to that. And there were several of


468
0:32:46,27 --> 0:32:51,899
us in the United States Senate back in 2005
and 2006 who saw this on the horizon, who


469
0:32:51,899 --> 0:32:55,49
saw the problem with Freddie and Fannie, and
tried to move forth with a bill -- I was on


470
0:32:55,49 --> 0:32:59,38
the Banking Committee. We voted a bill out
of committee to try to solve this problem,


471
0:32:59,38 --> 0:33:4,9
to constrain Fannie and Freddie, and there
were a lot of people out there fighting that,


472
0:33:4,9 --> 0:33:8,58
including Harry Reid and his minions on the
other side of the aisle. I sent -- I signed


473
0:33:8,58 --> 0:33:12,84
a letter, along with 24 other senators, that
said, we either do something now, stop the


474
0:33:12,84 --> 0:33:17,8
filibuster of this bill, Harry Reid, Barack
Obama, Joe Biden, all of whom were in the


475
0:33:17,8 --> 0:33:22,59
Senate at the time. They were filibustering
this bill to allow reform of Fannie and Freddie.


476
0:33:22,59 --> 0:33:27,33
And we said, if this doesn't happen, if we
don't constrain these two behemoths from continuing


477
0:33:27,33 --> 0:33:33,179
to underwrite this subprime mortgage problem,
then we're going to have a collapse. Unfortunately,


478
0:33:33,179 --> 0:33:36,76
that proved -- proved to be true. The problem
now is, what are you going to do about it?


479
0:33:36,76 --> 0:33:41,139
And what I've said is that, as you heard me
say before, let capitalism work. Allow these


480
0:33:41,139 --> 0:33:46,2
-- allow these banks to -- to realize their
losses. And create an opportunity for folks


481
0:33:46,2 --> 0:33:50,799
who have houses to realize their losses and
at least help them out. That's why I proposed


482
0:33:50,799 --> 0:33:55,63
in my tax plan -- and I talk about five areas
where I allow deductions -- well, one of them


483
0:33:55,63 --> 0:33:58,95
would be, be able to deduct losses from the
sale of your home. Right now, you can't do


484
0:33:58,95 --> 0:34:3,38
that. You have to pay gains, depending on
the amount, but you can't deduct the losses.


485
0:34:3,38 --> 0:34:7,83
This is something I think is important temporarily
to put in place to allow people the freedom


486
0:34:7,83 --> 0:34:12,779
to be able to go out and get out from underneath
these houses that they're holding onto and


487
0:34:12,779 --> 0:34:16,149
at least get some relief from the federal
government for doing so.


488
0:34:16,149 --> 0:34:19,489
>> WILLIAMS: Congressman Paul, should that
be any role for the government? Are those


489
0:34:19,489 --> 0:34:22,229
folks owed anything for being under?


490
0:34:22,229 --> 0:34:26,919
>> PAUL: Well, the government owes them a
free market and a sound monetary system, but


491
0:34:26,919 --> 0:34:30,809
they didn't give it to them. They gave them
a mess. They gave them a financial system


492
0:34:30,809 --> 0:34:35,399
that literally created this problem. And it
was compounded -- first, the line of credit


493
0:34:35,399 --> 0:34:40,519
to the -- to the Federal Reserve, it was excessive.
Everybody now admits in Washington interest


494
0:34:40,519 --> 0:34:44,399
rates were kept too low, too long. But not
only that, in addition to that, it was an


495
0:34:44,399 --> 0:34:48,95
insult to injury, because they kept interest
rates especially low with Freddie Mac and


496
0:34:48,95 --> 0:34:52,179
Fannie Mae, and there was a line of credit
there, and it was a guarantee. As a matter


497
0:34:52,179 --> 0:34:56,819
of fact, I had introduced legislation 10 years
before the bubble burst to eliminate that


498
0:34:56,819 --> 0:35:2,329
line of credit. But then the Community Reinvestment
Act added more fuel to it, you know, forcing


499
0:35:2,329 --> 0:35:8,979
banks to make loans that are risky loans.
So the whole bubble was easily seen. The consequences


500
0:35:8,979 --> 0:35:14,369
were anticipated. It was all government manufactured.
But the question is, is what do you do after


501
0:35:14,369 --> 0:35:18,69
you come upon a mess that the government and
the politicians created? The best thing you


502
0:35:18,69 --> 0:35:22,819
can do is get out of the way, because you
want the prices to come down so that people


503
0:35:22,819 --> 0:35:27,279
will start buying them again, but politicians
can't allow that to happen. Our policies in


504
0:35:27,279 --> 0:35:32,19
Washington still has been to try to stimulate
houses and keep -- keep prices up.


505
0:35:32,19 --> 0:35:36,65
>> PAUL: But this whole thing about how we
get involved in this low interest rate to


506
0:35:36,65 --> 0:35:41,829
stimulate the economy, almost everybody in
Washington now in almost all spectrums of


507
0:35:41,829 --> 0:35:47,329
the economic sphere do not believe in wage
and price controls, but they believe in controlling


508
0:35:47,329 --> 0:35:52,209
interest rates. That's one-half of the whole
economy, and here we have a bunch of guys


509
0:35:52,209 --> 0:35:56,259
getting in a room in secret, deciding what
interest rates should be, and they create


510
0:35:56,259 --> 0:36:1,299
this mess. So, yes, we need to get out of
the way, but instead the debt has to be liquidated.


511
0:36:1,299 --> 0:36:5,869
The mortgage derivatives was a monster. A
lot of people made a lot of money on that.


512
0:36:5,869 --> 0:36:10,229
But guess what? The Federal Reserve, to the
tune of trillions and trillions of dollars,


513
0:36:10,229 --> 0:36:14,359
as well as TARP funds, were used to bail out
the people that made all this money. Guess


514
0:36:14,359 --> 0:36:17,119
what happened to the bad debt? It should have
been wiped off the book. They should have


515
0:36:17,119 --> 0:36:22,99
gone bankrupt. It was dumped on the taxpayers,
and the taxpayers still have it. And as long


516
0:36:22,99 --> 0:36:26,42
as you maintain that debt on the books, you're
not going to have growth. This is why Japan


517
0:36:26,42 --> 0:36:30,89
hasn't recovered. We're in four years now,
and it's going to continue until we understand


518
0:36:30,89 --> 0:36:35,1
who creates the business cycle, how it happens,
and what you have to do to get out of it.


519
0:36:35,1 --> 0:36:39,19
>> WILLIAMS: Gentlemen, 30 seconds, please,
on this, starting with Governor Romney. To


520
0:36:39,19 --> 0:36:41,94
help these homeowners or not?


521
0:36:41,94 --> 0:36:45,859
>> ROMNEY: To help them? Of course we help
them. Pam Mati here in Florida is cracking


522
0:36:45,859 --> 0:36:49,849
down on people who are committing fraud, number
one. Number two, you have to get government


523
0:36:49,849 --> 0:36:53,29
out of the mess. Government has created the
mess. Number three, you're going to have to


524
0:36:53,29 --> 0:36:57,559
help people see if they can't get more flexibility
from their banks. Right now, with Dodd- Frank,


525
0:36:57,559 --> 0:37:2,39
we made it harder for banks to renegotiate
mortgages to help people get out. And finally,


526
0:37:2,39 --> 0:37:6,4
you've got to get the economy going again
with people having jobs. With Florida with


527
0:37:6,4 --> 0:37:12,69
9.9 percent unemployment, and with 18 percent
real unemployment in this state, and underemployment,


528
0:37:12,69 --> 0:37:15,16
you're not going to get housing recovered
unless you get jobs created again.


529
0:37:15,16 --> 0:37:15,65
>> WILLIAMS: Speaker?


530
0:37:15,65 --> 0:37:19,729
>> GINGRICH: Well, I think, first of all,
if you could repeal Dodd- Frank tomorrow morning,


531
0:37:19,729 --> 0:37:23,68
you would see the economy start to improve
overnight. I mean, people don't realize this


532
0:37:23,68 --> 0:37:27,819
bill is -- a little bit of what Congressman
Paul said. The fact is Dodd-Frank has led


533
0:37:27,819 --> 0:37:33,799
the biggest banks to get bigger. It is crushing
independent banks. It has an anti-housing


534
0:37:33,799 --> 0:37:38,65
bias. Federal regulators are slowing down
and making it harder to make loans for housing,


535
0:37:38,65 --> 0:37:42,63
and it is crippling small business borrowing.
All those things are a function of a bill


536
0:37:42,63 --> 0:37:47,249
passed by the Democrats called Dodd-Frank.
If they would repeal it tomorrow morning,


537
0:37:47,249 --> 0:37:49,23
you would have a better housing market the
next day.


538
0:37:49,23 --> 0:37:53,289
>> WILLIAMS: Do you really think the financial
system is overregulated? That's the second


539
0:37:53,289 --> 0:37:55,1
mention of Dodd-Frank tonight.


540
0:37:55,1 --> 0:37:57,969
>> GINGRICH: I really think that when -- yes,
of course it's overregulated. When you put


541
0:37:57,969 --> 0:38:2,489
that much power in the Treasury under Geithner,
you know, it's an invitation to corruption.


542
0:38:2,489 --> 0:38:7,459
When you have a bias in the bill which makes
the big banks get bigger, exactly the opposite


543
0:38:7,459 --> 0:38:11,319
of what a rational policy would be, it's a
bad bill. When you have regulators walk in


544
0:38:11,319 --> 0:38:15,849
small local banks and say, do not loan money
on housing, it's a bad idea.


545
0:38:15,849 --> 0:38:18,569
>> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, was it overregulated
prior to the collapse?


546
0:38:18,569 --> 0:38:23,789
>> ROMNEY: It was poorly regulated. Markets
have to have regulation to work. You can't


547
0:38:23,789 --> 0:38:27,249
have everybody open a bank in their garage.
You have to have regulation, but it's got


548
0:38:27,249 --> 0:38:31,15
to be up to date. And they didn't have capital
requirements put in place for the different


549
0:38:31,15 --> 0:38:35,599
classes of assets banks had. They also didn't
have regulation properly put in place for


550
0:38:35,599 --> 0:38:40,779
mortgage lenders. Derivatives weren't being
regulated. You need to have regulation that's


551
0:38:40,779 --> 0:38:45,569
up to date. They had old regulation, burdensome.
Then they passed Dodd-Frank, which the Speaker


552
0:38:45,569 --> 0:38:50,29
is absolutely right. It has made it almost
impossible for community banks. I was with


553
0:38:50,29 --> 0:38:54,579
the head of one of the big banks in New York.
He said they have hundreds of lawyers working


554
0:38:54,579 --> 0:38:59,19
on Dodd-Frank to implement it. Community banks
don't have hundreds of lawyers. It's just


555
0:38:59,19 --> 0:39:3,63
killing the residential home market and it's
got to be replaced.


556
0:39:3,63 --> 0:39:6,289
>> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, let me ask you
this. There was a lot of talk in the last


557
0:39:6,289 --> 0:39:10,95
presidential campaign about that 3:00 a.m.
phone call. Let's say President Romney gets


558
0:39:10,95 --> 0:39:17,739
that phone call, and it is to say that Fidel
Castro has died. And there are credible people


559
0:39:17,739 --> 0:39:25,44
in the Pentagon who predict upwards of half
a million Cubans may take that as a cue to


560
0:39:25,44 --> 0:39:27,75
come to the United States. What do you do?


561
0:39:27,75 --> 0:39:32,499
>> ROMNEY: Well, first of all, you thank heavens
that Fidel Castro has returned to his maker


562
0:39:32,499 --> 0:39:35,189
and will be sent to another land.


563
0:39:35,189 --> 0:39:35,91
>> [APPLAUSE]


564
0:39:35,91 --> 0:39:41,979
>> ROMNEY: Now, number two, you work very
aggressively with the new leadership in Cuba


565
0:39:41,979 --> 0:39:47,15
to try and move them towards a more open degree
than they have had in the past. We just had,


566
0:39:47,15 --> 0:39:53,369
with Wilman Villar, his life was just lost
in a hunger strike fighting for democracy.


567
0:39:53,369 --> 0:39:56,969
This president has taken a very dangerous
course with regards to Cuba saying we're going


568
0:39:56,969 --> 0:40:0,9
to relax relations, we're going to open up
travel to Cuba. This is the wrong time for


569
0:40:0,9 --> 0:40:5,13
that, with this kind of heroics going on.
We want to stand with the people of Cuba that


570
0:40:5,13 --> 0:40:10,199
want freedom. We want to move that effort
forward not by giving in and saying we lost,


571
0:40:10,199 --> 0:40:11,839
but by saying we will fight for democracy.


572
0:40:11,839 --> 0:40:16,219
>> WILLIAMS: Mr. Speaker, as a practical matter,
along the Florida coast, though, you know


573
0:40:16,219 --> 0:40:21,739
the policy, so called wet foot/dry foot. What
do you do if folks start arriving in the United


574
0:40:21,739 --> 0:40:22,149
States?


575
0:40:22,149 --> 0:40:27,19
>> GINGRICH: Well, Brian, first of all, I
guess the only thing I would suggest is I


576
0:40:27,19 --> 0:40:32,38
don't think that Fidel is going to meet his
maker. I think he's going to go to the other


577
0:40:32,38 --> 0:40:37,829
place. Second, I would suggest to you the
policy of the United States should be aggressively


578
0:40:37,829 --> 0:40:42,479
to overthrow the regime and to do everything
we can to support those Cubans who want freedom.


579
0:40:42,479 --> 0:40:46,559
You know, Obama is very infatuated with an
Arab Spring. He doesn't seem to be able to


580
0:40:46,559 --> 0:40:51,66
look 90 miles south of the United States to
have a Cuban Spring. So I would try to put


581
0:40:51,66 --> 0:40:56,869
in place a very aggressive policy of reaching
out to every single Cuban who would like to


582
0:40:56,869 --> 0:41:1,779
be free, helping network them together, reaching
out to the younger generation inside the dictatorship,


583
0:41:1,779 --> 0:41:6,43
and indicating they don't have a future as
a dictatorship because a Gingrich presidency


584
0:41:6,43 --> 0:41:9,39
will not tolerate four more years of this
dictatorship.


585
0:41:9,39 --> 0:41:12,689
>> WILLIAMS: Overt and covert, are you talking
about engaging the U.S. military?


586
0:41:12,689 --> 0:41:16,59
>> GINGRICH: No, I'm talking about using every
asset available to the United States, including


587
0:41:16,59 --> 0:41:20,729
appropriate covert operations, to maximize
the distance, what Ronald Reagan, Pope John


588
0:41:20,729 --> 0:41:25,199
Paul II, and Margaret Thatcher did to the
Soviet empire, bring together every asset


589
0:41:25,199 --> 0:41:30,209
we have to minimize the survival of the dictatorship
and to maximize the chance for freedom in


590
0:41:30,209 --> 0:41:30,819
Cuba.


591
0:41:30,819 --> 0:41:32,4
>> WILLIAMS: Congressman?


592
0:41:32,4 --> 0:41:36,54
>> PAUL: I -- I have a little bit of work
to do yet on him on foreign policy.


593
0:41:36,54 --> 0:41:37,419
>> [LAUGHTER]


594
0:41:37,419 --> 0:41:38,299
>> [APPLAUSE]


595
0:41:38,299 --> 0:41:44,469
>> PAUL: No, I would do pretty much the opposite.
I don't like the isolationism of not talking


596
0:41:44,469 --> 0:41:49,39
to people. I was drafted in 1962 at the height
of the Cold War when the missiles were in


597
0:41:49,39 --> 0:41:56,609
Cuba. And the Cold War's over. And I think
we propped up Castro for 40-some years because


598
0:41:56,609 --> 0:42:1,819
we put on these sanctions, and this -- only
used us as a scapegoat. He could always say,


599
0:42:1,819 --> 0:42:5,709
anything wrong, it's the United States' fault.
But I think it's time -- time to quit this


600
0:42:5,709 --> 0:42:11,93
isolation business of not talking to people.
We talked to the Soviets. We talk to the Chinese.


601
0:42:11,93 --> 0:42:16,509
And we opened up trade, and we're not killing
each other now. We fought with the Vietnamese


602
0:42:16,509 --> 0:42:20,789
for a long time. We finally gave up, started
talking to them, now we trade with them. I


603
0:42:20,789 --> 0:42:25,68
don't know why -- why the Cuban people should
be so intimidating. I -- I don't know where


604
0:42:25,68 --> 0:42:28,839
you get this assumption that all of a sudden
all the Cubans would come up here. I would


605
0:42:28,839 --> 0:42:31,93
probably think they were going to celebrate
and they're going to have a lot more freedom


606
0:42:31,93 --> 0:42:37,239
if we would only open up our doors and say,
we want to talk to you, and trade with you,


607
0:42:37,239 --> 0:42:41,69
and come visit. Sometimes they can't even
send packages down there. I -- I think we're


608
0:42:41,69 --> 0:42:47,14
living in the dark ages when we can't even
talk to the Cuban people. I think it's not


609
0:42:47,14 --> 0:42:53,359
1962 anymore. And we don't have to use force
and intimidation and overthrow of a -- in


610
0:42:53,359 --> 0:42:54,809
governments. I just don't think that's going
to work.


611
0:42:54,809 --> 0:42:57,679
>> WILLIAMS: Senator Santorum, an admittedly...


612
0:42:57,679 --> 0:42:57,99
>> [APPLAUSE]


613
0:42:57,99 --> 0:43:2,509
>> WILLIAMS: ... cynical question. If there
was a strong lobby of Chinese dissidents living


614
0:43:2,509 --> 0:43:9,41
in a state as politically important of -- as
Florida, do you think we'd have a trade policy


615
0:43:9,41 --> 0:43:12,97
with China that looks more like the trade
policy with Cuba?


616
0:43:12,97 --> 0:43:19,79
>> SANTORUM: Not if they were not 90 miles
off our shore. This is an important doctrine


617
0:43:19,79 --> 0:43:24,72
of the United States to make sure that our
hemisphere and those who are close to us are


618
0:43:24,72 --> 0:43:29,499
-- are folks that we can and should deal with.
And right now, we have and have had for 50


619
0:43:29,499 --> 0:43:34,64
years a dictatorship in Cuba. We've had sanctions
on them. They should continue. They should


620
0:43:34,64 --> 0:43:39,279
continue until the Castros are dead, and then
we should make it very clear that if you want


621
0:43:39,279 --> 0:43:45,569
mountains of aid, if you want normal relationships,
if you want to improve your economy, if you


622
0:43:45,569 --> 0:43:50,289
want to have the opportunity for freedom,
that the United States stands ready now to


623
0:43:50,289 --> 0:43:54,109
embrace you now that you've gotten rid of
these tyrants who -- who have controlled you


624
0:43:54,109 --> 0:43:58,539
for these 50-plus years. That's why the sanctions
have to stay in place, because we need to


625
0:43:58,539 --> 0:44:2,94
have a -- a very solid offer to come forward
and help the Cuban people. And you're right,


626
0:44:2,94 --> 0:44:9,15
Ron. It's not 1962. They're now with the Cubans
and the Venezuelans, the Nicaraguans. There


627
0:44:9,15 --> 0:44:15,109
is a growing network of folks now working
with the jihadists, the Iranians, who are


628
0:44:15,109 --> 0:44:20,309
very, very excited about the opportunity to
having platforms 90 miles off our coast, just


629
0:44:20,309 --> 0:44:26,329
like the Soviets were, very anxious to have
platforms 90 miles off our coast, or in Venezuela,


630
0:44:26,329 --> 0:44:29,63
or in Nicaragua, and other places they could
come across the southern border. This is a


631
0:44:29,63 --> 0:44:33,64
serious threat. It's a threat that I've been
talking about for about six or seven years.


632
0:44:33,64 --> 0:44:39,67
And it's one that's not going to go away until
we -- we confront the threat and hopefully


633
0:44:39,67 --> 0:44:44,88
are able to convince the Cuban people that,
through what Newt and others have suggested,


634
0:44:44,88 --> 0:44:46,859
to -- to change their government at the appropriate
time.


635
0:44:46,859 --> 0:44:50,64
>> WILLIAMS: Governor -- Governor Romney,
last night, the Abe Lincoln, U.S. aircraft


636
0:44:50,64 --> 0:44:55,699
carrier and a couple other attendant U.S.
Navy vessels passed through the Strait of


637
0:44:55,699 --> 0:45:2,349
Hormuz into the Persian Gulf. If Iran was
able to fulfill, carry out that threat to


638
0:45:2,349 --> 0:45:6,779
shut down the strait, would you consider that
an act of war? What would you do about it


639
0:45:6,779 --> 0:45:7,149
as president?


640
0:45:7,149 --> 0:45:11,559
>> ROMNEY: Of -- of course it's an act of
war. It is appropriate and -- and essential


641
0:45:11,559 --> 0:45:17,589
for our military, for our Navy to -- to maintain
open seas. We have control of the commons,


642
0:45:17,589 --> 0:45:24,17
of space, air, and the seas. Our Navy has
the capacity to do that -- or did in the past.


643
0:45:24,17 --> 0:45:28,44
Under this president and under prior presidents,
we keep on shrinking our Navy. Our Navy is


644
0:45:28,44 --> 0:45:33,589
now smaller than any time since 1917. And
-- and -- and the president is building roughly


645
0:45:33,589 --> 0:45:37,979
nine ships a year. We ought to raise that
to 15 ships a year, not because we want to


646
0:45:37,979 --> 0:45:42,88
go to war with anyone, but because we don't
want anyone to take the -- the -- the hazard


647
0:45:42,88 --> 0:45:47,449
of going against us. We want them to see that
we're so strong they couldn't possibly defeat


648
0:45:47,449 --> 0:45:51,289
us. So we ought to have an aircraft carrier
in the gulf, an aircraft carrier, and, of


649
0:45:51,289 --> 0:45:56,479
course, the task force with it in the Mediterranean.
We want to show Iran, any action of that nature


650
0:45:56,479 --> 0:46:0,599
will be considered an act of war, an act of
terror and -- and America is going to be keep


651
0:46:0,599 --> 0:46:1,809
those sea lanes open.


652
0:46:1,809 --> 0:46:5,829
>> WILLIAMS: So, Speaker Gingrich if you accept
that bedrock definition that it is an act


653
0:46:5,829 --> 0:46:11,549
of war, how do you gauge the appetite on the
part of the American people after the better


654
0:46:11,549 --> 0:46:18,29
part of a decade of warfare, fighting dual
wars overseas for something like that?


655
0:46:18,29 --> 0:46:24,249
>> GINGRICH: The American people have no interest
in going to war anywhere. We had no interest


656
0:46:24,249 --> 0:46:27,819
in going to war with the Japanese when they
bombed Pearl Harbor. We had no interest in


657
0:46:27,819 --> 0:46:34,199
going to Afghanistan when Jihadist's destroyed
the World Trade Center. The fact is, we've


658
0:46:34,199 --> 0:46:39,16
historically been a country that would like
peace, we'd like stability. But we also have


659
0:46:39,16 --> 0:46:44,69
a historic commitment to -- to freedom of
the sea. And I would say that the most dangerous


660
0:46:44,69 --> 0:46:50,49
thing, which by the way, Barack Obama just
did, the -- the Iranians are practicing closing


661
0:46:50,49 --> 0:46:56,16
the Straits of Hormuz, actively taunting us,
so he cancels a military exercise with the


662
0:46:56,16 --> 0:47:3,13
Israelis so as not to be provocative? Now,
dictatorships respond to strength, they don't


663
0:47:3,13 --> 0:47:7,719
respond to weakness and I think there's a
very grave danger that the Iranians think


664
0:47:7,719 --> 0:47:12,39
that in fact this president is so weak, they
could close the Straits of Hormuz and not


665
0:47:12,39 --> 0:47:13,569
suffer substantial consequences.


666
0:47:13,569 --> 0:47:18,979
>> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, how do you end
a war in Afghanistan without talking to the


667
0:47:18,979 --> 0:47:19,589
Taliban?


668
0:47:19,589 --> 0:47:25,17
>> ROMNEY: By beating them. By standing behind
our troops and making sure that -- that we


669
0:47:25,17 --> 0:47:30,939
have transitioned to the Afghan military,
a capacity for them to be successful in holding


670
0:47:30,939 --> 0:47:35,88
off the Taliban. Our -- our mission there,
is to be able to turn Afghanistan and it's


671
0:47:35,88 --> 0:47:43,349
sovereignty over to a military of Afghan descent
-- Afghan people that can defend their sovereignty.


672
0:47:43,349 --> 0:47:47,199
And that is something which we can accomplish
in the next couple of years. This president,


673
0:47:47,199 --> 0:47:50,719
however, has done -- made -- made it very
difficult for our troops to be able to be


674
0:47:50,719 --> 0:47:56,439
successful in that mission by, number one,
announcing a withdrawal date for our troops,


675
0:47:56,439 --> 0:48:0,829
number two drawing down our surge troops faster
than the time the commanders on the ground


676
0:48:0,829 --> 0:48:5,459
was necessary. You don't draw them down during
the middle of the fighting season. And finally,


677
0:48:5,459 --> 0:48:9,63
by not overseeing elections in Afghanistan
to assure that the -- the selection of their


678
0:48:9,63 --> 0:48:14,49
president was seen by the people as being
legitimate. And he has failed in -- in executing


679
0:48:14,49 --> 0:48:18,38
a policy in Afghanistan that would optimize
our prospects of success.


680
0:48:18,38 --> 0:48:18,67
>> [CROSSTALK]


681
0:48:18,67 --> 0:48:21,779
>> WILLIAMS: Go ahead. I was just going to
ask, any appetite on this stage to negotiate


682
0:48:21,779 --> 0:48:22,799
with the Taliban? Congressman?


683
0:48:22,799 --> 0:48:25,98
>> PAUL: No, but I wanted to get involved
in the discussion.


684
0:48:25,98 --> 0:48:27,449
>> WILLIAMS: No, go ahead?


685
0:48:27,449 --> 0:48:32,509
>> PAUL: Because the question was, you know,
would you go to war? And Mitt said he would


686
0:48:32,509 --> 0:48:39,69
-- he would go to war. But you have to think
about the preliminary act that might cause


687
0:48:39,69 --> 0:48:44,17
them to want to close the Straits of Hormuz,
and that's the blockade. We're blockading


688
0:48:44,17 --> 0:48:49,189
them. Can you imagine what we would do if
somebody blockaded the Gulf of Mexico? That


689
0:48:49,189 --> 0:48:54,38
would be an act of war. So the act of war
has already been committed and this is a retaliation.


690
0:48:54,38 --> 0:48:59,63
But besides, there's no interest whatsoever
for Iran to close the Straits of Hormuz. I


691
0:48:59,63 --> 0:49:3,989
mean they need it as much as we do. I mean
so you have to put that into perspective.


692
0:49:3,989 --> 0:49:10,339
But this whole idea that -- that it's -- we
-- we have to go to war because we've already


693
0:49:10,339 --> 0:49:15,91
committed an act by blockading the country
and I -- I don't see -- I -- I -- and -- and


694
0:49:15,91 --> 0:49:21,269
I think Newt is right. I think he's wrong
about World War II, I think the people were


695
0:49:21,269 --> 0:49:25,849
ready because we did it properly. We declared
it and we won it quickly. But, not the people


696
0:49:25,849 --> 0:49:30,17
are not ready. We don't have any money. We
have too many wars. We -- the people want


697
0:49:30,17 --> 0:49:35,249
to come home and they certainly don't want
a hot war in Iran right now and I -- I think


698
0:49:35,249 --> 0:49:38,319
that would be the most foolish thing in the
world to do right now is take on Iran.


699
0:49:38,319 --> 0:49:41,619
>> WILLIAMS: Right now for us another break.
I'll welcome two colleagues out here to the


700
0:49:41,619 --> 0:49:46,579
stage when we continue from Tampa right after
this.


701
0:49:46,579 --> 0:49:52,65
>> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]


702
0:49:52,65 --> 0:50:18,829
>> WILLIAMS: And welcome back to Tampa. I
am happy to welcome two fellow journalists


703
0:50:18,829 --> 0:50:22,88
to this stage. Happy to be joined now by our
partners in this debate. In fact, "The Tampa


704
0:50:22,88 --> 0:50:28,39
Bay Times" and "National Journal." Adam Smith
is the longtime political editor at "The Tampa


705
0:50:28,39 --> 0:50:33,289
Bay Times," covering national, state and local
politics for more than a decade, one of the


706
0:50:33,289 --> 0:50:37,39
very best in the trade. And besides, a lot
of people just thought a GOP debate should


707
0:50:37,39 --> 0:50:44,219
have Adam Smith present. Beth Reinhard is
a political correspondent for "National Journal."


708
0:50:44,219 --> 0:50:49,39
She is a Florida native, was a veteran political
reporter at "The Miami Herald" for 11 years.


709
0:50:49,39 --> 0:50:52,709
But one piece of business, Senator Santorum,
I had to go to a break. I didn't get you in


710
0:50:52,709 --> 0:50:58,459
on what we'll call the Iran round, because
you've talked about this a lot. Specifically,


711
0:50:58,459 --> 0:51:5,509
as a last resort, as you said, taking out
Iran's nuclear program. The problem with that,


712
0:51:5,509 --> 0:51:12,369
so many in the military tell you, is the target
list. Where do you limit it -- the air strikes


713
0:51:12,369 --> 0:51:19,529
that some estimate would begin at 30 to 60
days sustained, taking out air defenses, all


714
0:51:19,529 --> 0:51:23,859
of that familiar language the American people
have just been through for a decade?


715
0:51:23,859 --> 0:51:28,119
>> SANTORUM: Well, the contrast for that is,
what happens if Iran gets a nuclear weapon


716
0:51:28,119 --> 0:51:33,949
and the entire world changes? Iran is not
just another country, or a little, small country,


717
0:51:33,949 --> 0:51:40,38
as President Obama said classically during
the campaign. Obama's Iran policy has been


718
0:51:40,38 --> 0:51:44,91
a colossal failure. It's been a failure because
he's not been true to the American public


719
0:51:44,91 --> 0:51:49,779
about the threat that Iran poses to the world.
Not just to Israel, but to the world and to


720
0:51:49,779 --> 0:51:54,939
the United States. The bottom line is the
theocracy that runs Iran is the equivalent


721
0:51:54,939 --> 0:51:59,599
of having al Qaeda in charge of a country
with huge oil reserves, gas reserves, and


722
0:51:59,599 --> 0:52:4,609
a nuclear weapon. That is something that no
president could possibly allow to have happen


723
0:52:4,609 --> 0:52:32,329
under any circumstances. And when you asked
the question, Brian, are we at -- 


724
0:52:32,329 --> 0:52:43,739
is 


725
0:52:43,739 --> 0:53:10,359
this 


726
0:53:10,359 --> 0:53:13,93
is an act of war? Well, let's look at the
acts of war that Iran -- they are -- they


727
0:53:13,93 --> 0:53:18,819
are holding hostages, they are attacking our
troops, their IEDs, the improvised explosive


728
0:53:18,819 --> 0:53:23,119
devices, that are killing our troops in Afghanistan,
and killed them in Iraq, and maimed so many


729
0:53:23,119 --> 0:53:29,49
were produced, and people were trained and
funded in Iran specifically to kill American


730
0:53:29,49 --> 0:53:33,689
troops. You look at the ships that have been
attacked by Iran, embassies were attacked


731
0:53:33,689 --> 0:53:38,499
by Iran. A -- Iran has plotted to kill the
Saudi ambassador here in this country. It


732
0:53:38,499 --> 0:53:45,549
is a long list of attacks of -- of warlike
behavior on the part of this regime. And to


733
0:53:45,549 --> 0:53:50,9
believe that if they have a nuclear weapon
they're somehow going to become into the community


734
0:53:50,9 --> 0:53:55,709
of nations is a reckless act on the part of
a president. It would be reckless not to do


735
0:53:55,709 --> 0:53:58,979
something to stop them from getting this nuclear
weapon.


736
0:53:58,979 --> 0:54:6,29
>> WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you. And to interests
of local state politics, Beth Reinhard will


737
0:54:6,29 --> 0:54:7,499
take over the questioning.


738
0:54:7,499 --> 0:54:14,329
>> REINHARD: Senator Santorum, here in Florida,
BP is still airing apologetic appeals on television,


739
0:54:14,329 --> 0:54:19,449
but there are proposals to expand offshore
oil drilling. The state's most optimistic


740
0:54:19,449 --> 0:54:25,259
estimates say more drilling would create 5,000
jobs, but an oil spill would threaten Florida's


741
0:54:25,259 --> 0:54:30,64
tourism industry, which employs nearly 1 million
people. Is that worth the risk?


742
0:54:30,64 --> 0:54:35,18
>> SANTORUM: What threatens the tourist industry
in Florida, as we've seen, is a very bad economy,


743
0:54:35,18 --> 0:54:40,41
and a very bad economy that became a bad economy
why? Because of a huge spike in oil prices


744
0:54:40,41 --> 0:54:47,67
in the summer of 2008. So energy is absolutely
key to keep all of our country healthy, specifically


745
0:54:47,67 --> 0:54:53,39
Florida, which is a destination place. This
is a -- this is a place that relies upon people


746
0:54:53,39 --> 0:54:57,439
being able to travel and afford to be able
to travel to come down here, relies upon an


747
0:54:57,439 --> 0:55:2,229
economy being strong. I was at a manufacturer
in Sarasota County today and was talking about


748
0:55:2,229 --> 0:55:7,449
them as a manufacturer and that, you know,
the -- the importance of manufacturing jobs,


749
0:55:7,449 --> 0:55:11,989
yes, even here in the state of Florida, and
the price of energy for them to be able to


750
0:55:11,989 --> 0:55:17,16
be competitive. It is absolutely essential
that we have as much domestic supply of oil,


751
0:55:17,16 --> 0:55:22,29
that we build the Keystone pipeline, that
we create the jobs that -- that that would


752
0:55:22,29 --> 0:55:27,739
create, and provide oil from domestic sources.
Pipelines that run on the floor of the sea


753
0:55:27,739 --> 0:55:33,339
or pipelines that come through America are
the safest way to transport oil. It is tankers


754
0:55:33,339 --> 0:55:38,119
that are causing -- that cause much more problems.
Pipelines are the safe way. Building those


755
0:55:38,119 --> 0:55:43,729
rigs, piping that oil into -- into -- into
our shore is the best way to create a good


756
0:55:43,729 --> 0:55:45,74
economy for the state of Florida.


757
0:55:45,74 --> 0:55:50,279
>> REINHARD: All of you favor making English
the official language of the United States,


758
0:55:50,279 --> 0:55:55,49
which could mean that ballots and other government
documents would not be available in Spanish.


759
0:55:55,49 --> 0:55:59,38
But, Speaker Gingrich, you're sending out
press releases in Spanish; Governor Romney,


760
0:55:59,38 --> 0:56:4,709
you're advertising in Spanish. Why is it OK
for you to court voters in Spanish, but not


761
0:56:4,709 --> 0:56:8,65
OK for the government to serve them in Spanish?
Speaker Gingrich?


762
0:56:8,65 --> 0:56:14,189
>> GINGRICH: Well, first of all, you immediately
jump down to a very important language, but


763
0:56:14,189 --> 0:56:18,689
not the only language. The challenge of the
United States is simple. There are 86 languages


764
0:56:18,689 --> 0:56:25,429
in Miami Dade College, 86. There are over
200 languages spoken in Chicago. Now, how


765
0:56:25,429 --> 0:56:30,599
do you unify the country? What -- what is
the common bond that enables people to be


766
0:56:30,599 --> 0:56:35,519
both citizens and to rise commercially and
have a better life and a greater opportunity?


767
0:56:35,519 --> 0:56:40,229
I think campaigning, historically, you've
always been willing to go to people on their


768
0:56:40,229 --> 0:56:45,91
terms in their culture, whether it's Greek
Independence Day or something you did for


769
0:56:45,91 --> 0:56:50,65
the Irish on St. Patrick's Day. And I'm perfectly
happy to be on Radio Mambi, and I'm perfectly


770
0:56:50,65 --> 0:56:57,459
happy to have a lot of support in the Hispanic
community. But as a country to unify ourselves


771
0:56:57,459 --> 0:57:3,49
in a future in which there may well be 300
or 400 languages spoken in the United States,


772
0:57:3,49 --> 0:57:8,189
I think it is essential to have a central
language that we expect people to learn and


773
0:57:8,189 --> 0:57:9,579
to be able to communicate with each other
in.


774
0:57:9,579 --> 0:57:11,999
>> REINHARD: So to be clear, you would only
have ballots in English?


775
0:57:11,999 --> 0:57:15,49
>> GINGRICH: I would have ballots in English.
And I think you could have programs where


776
0:57:15,49 --> 0:57:17,209
virtually everybody would be able to read
the ballots.


777
0:57:17,209 --> 0:57:19,89
>> REINHARD: Governor Romney, can you take
that question?


778
0:57:19,89 --> 0:57:22,91
>> ROMNEY: I think Speaker Gingrich is right
with regards to what he's described. I'd note


779
0:57:22,91 --> 0:57:28,759
that in my state we had a tradition of teaching
people in the language of their birth, and


780
0:57:28,759 --> 0:57:33,569
so we had in our school systems people being
taught in a whole range of languages. And


781
0:57:33,569 --> 0:57:37,979
we had to have teachers that could teach in
Cambodian, in Vietnamese, and other languages.


782
0:57:37,979 --> 0:57:42,309
And our kids were being taught in foreign
languages in our own schools. And we found


783
0:57:42,309 --> 0:57:46,829
at the end of their education experience they
couldn't all speak English well. It made absolutely


784
0:57:46,829 --> 0:57:52,249
no sense. And so we campaigned for English
immersion in our schools and said kids coming


785
0:57:52,249 --> 0:57:56,289
in will have a transition period. Then we're
going to teach them in English. Look, English


786
0:57:56,289 --> 0:58:0,66
is the language of this nation. People need
to learn English to be able to be successful,


787
0:58:0,66 --> 0:58:5,91
to get great jobs. We don't want to have people
limited in their capacity to achieve the American


788
0:58:5,91 --> 0:58:9,609
dream because they don't speak English. And
so encouraging people through every means


789
0:58:9,609 --> 0:58:15,239
possible to learn the language of America
is a good idea. Recognize at the same time


790
0:58:15,239 --> 0:58:19,789
we want people coming here from other cultures
that speak other languages. That strengthens


791
0:58:19,789 --> 0:58:24,359
America. It's a great thing. But having them
learn English is also a great thing for them


792
0:58:24,359 --> 0:58:25,479
and for their kids.


793
0:58:25,479 --> 0:58:27,379
>> REINHARD: Congressman Paul?


794
0:58:27,379 --> 0:58:32,64
>> PAUL: Yes, my answer is similar, but a
little bit different, because at the national


795
0:58:32,64 --> 0:58:36,709
level, obviously we have to have one language.
I mean, we can't have multiple languages.


796
0:58:36,709 --> 0:58:42,259
So, for legal reasons, we would have one language.
But our system really gives us a way to be


797
0:58:42,259 --> 0:58:46,799
more generous, because if Florida wanted to
have some ballots in Spanish, I certainly


798
0:58:46,799 --> 0:58:51,499
wouldn't support a federal law that would
prohibit Florida from accommodating a city


799
0:58:51,499 --> 0:58:56,42
election or a local election or a state election.
I think that's the magnificence of our system,


800
0:58:56,42 --> 0:59:2,14
where you can solve some of these problems
without dictating one answer for all states.


801
0:59:2,14 --> 0:59:4,13
But nationally, we should have one language.


802
0:59:4,13 --> 0:59:7,759
>> REINHARD: Speaker Gingrich, I want to move
on to a slightly different topic, the Dream


803
0:59:7,759 --> 0:59:12,829
Act, which, as you know, would provide a pathway
to citizenship for children who have been


804
0:59:12,829 --> 0:59:18,39
brought to the U.S. illegally if they attend
college or enroll in the military. Now, Governor


805
0:59:18,39 --> 0:59:21,88
Romney and Senator Santorum have both said
they would veto this legislation. Would you


806
0:59:21,88 --> 0:59:22,849
do the same?


807
0:59:22,849 --> 0:59:28,279
>> GINGRICH: No. I would work to get a signable
version which would be the military component.


808
0:59:28,279 --> 0:59:32,519
I think any young person living in the United
States who happened to have been brought here


809
0:59:32,519 --> 0:59:37,439
by their parents when they were young should
have the same opportunity to join the American


810
0:59:37,439 --> 0:59:42,39
military and earn citizenship which they would
have had from back home. We have a clear provision


811
0:59:42,39 --> 0:59:47,349
that if you live in a foreign country, and
you are prepared to join the American military,


812
0:59:47,349 --> 0:59:51,769
you can, in fact, earn the right to citizenship
by serving the United States and taking real


813
0:59:51,769 --> 0:59:57,39
risk on behalf of the United States. That
part of the Dream Act I would support. I would


814
0:59:57,39 --> 1:0:1,99
not support the part that simply says everybody
who goes to college is automatically waived


815
1:0:1,99 --> 1:0:2,4
for having broken the law.


816
1:0:2,4 --> 1:0:3,499
>> REINHARD: The questioning continues.


817
1:0:3,499 --> 1:0:7,999
>> ROMNEY: I just doubt that's the same position
that I have, and that is that I would not


818
1:0:7,999 --> 1:0:13,49
sign the Dream Act as it currently exists,
but I would sign the Dream Act if it were


819
1:0:13,49 --> 1:0:14,859
focused on military service.


820
1:0:14,859 --> 1:0:17,99
>> WILLIAMS: Thank you, Governor. Questioning
continues with Adam Smith.


821
1:0:17,99 --> 1:0:20,59
>> SMITH: Let's stay on immigration for a
second. Governor Romney, there is one thing


822
1:0:20,59 --> 1:0:24,89
I'm confused about. You say you don't want
to go and round up people and deport them,


823
1:0:24,89 --> 1:0:27,109
but you also say that they would have to go
back to their home countries and then apply


824
1:0:27,109 --> 1:0:30,609
for citizenship. So, if you don't deport them,
how do you send them home?


825
1:0:30,609 --> 1:0:34,719
>> ROMNEY: Well, the answer is self-deportation,
which is people decide they can do better


826
1:0:34,719 --> 1:0:38,9
by going home because they can't find work
here because they don't have legal documentation


827
1:0:38,9 --> 1:0:42,179
to allow them to work here. And so we're not
going to round people up. The way that we


828
1:0:42,179 --> 1:0:47,67
have in this society is to say, look, people
who have come here legally would, under my


829
1:0:47,67 --> 1:0:51,63
plan, be given a transition period and the
opportunity during that transition period


830
1:0:51,63 --> 1:0:56,259
to work here, but when that transition period
was over, they would no longer have the documentation


831
1:0:56,259 --> 1:1:0,39
to allow them to work in this country. At
that point, they can decide whether to remain


832
1:1:0,39 --> 1:1:5,449
or whether to return home and to apply for
legal residency in the United States, get


833
1:1:5,449 --> 1:1:9,239
in line with everybody else. And I know people
think but that's not fair to those that have


834
1:1:9,239 --> 1:1:9,92
come here illegally.


835
1:1:9,92 --> 1:1:14,229
>> SMITH: Isn't that what we have now? If
somebody doesn't feel they have the opportunity


836
1:1:14,229 --> 1:1:15,659
in America, they can go back any time they
want to.


837
1:1:15,659 --> 1:1:20,19
>> ROMNEY: Yes, we'd have a card that indicates
who's here illegally. And if people are not


838
1:1:20,19 --> 1:1:24,41
able to have a card, and have through an E-Verify
system determine that they are here illegally,


839
1:1:24,41 --> 1:1:27,849
then they're going to find they can't get
work here. And if people don't get work here,


840
1:1:27,849 --> 1:1:32,969
they're going to self-deport to a place where
they can get work. Ultimately, with this transition


841
1:1:32,969 --> 1:1:37,599
period in place, we would then allow people
to get in line at home and to come back to


842
1:1:37,599 --> 1:1:41,339
this country after they have reached the front
of the line. But I just don't think it's fair


843
1:1:41,339 --> 1:1:45,369
to the people who have loved ones waiting
in line legally to come to America and say,


844
1:1:45,369 --> 1:1:50,589
guess what? We're going to encourage a wave
of illegal immigration by giving amnesty of


845
1:1:50,589 --> 1:1:52,579
some kind to those who have come here illegally.


846
1:1:52,579 --> 1:1:56,19
>> SMITH: Senator Santorum, is self-deportation.
Is that a valid concept?


847
1:1:56,19 --> 1:1:59,839
>> SANTORUM: Well, it's happening now. I mean,
people are going back now because they can't


848
1:1:59,839 --> 1:2:4,469
find jobs because of the lack of employment
opportunities. The bottom line is, is that


849
1:2:4,469 --> 1:2:10,279
if you do enforce the law and say that people
who are here illegally, who are doing illegal


850
1:2:10,279 --> 1:2:14,89
acts -- and that is working, which you're
not allowed to do -- and if you're working,


851
1:2:14,89 --> 1:2:17,439
probably you've stolen someone's Social Security
number, which you are not allowed to do -- and


852
1:2:17,439 --> 1:2:22,809
that's another law that is broken -- that
we should enforce the law. It's not someone


853
1:2:22,809 --> 1:2:26,64
who has come here illegally in the first place
and they've only broken the law once. They


854
1:2:26,64 --> 1:2:30,15
continually break the law in this country,
and I don't think that's not something that


855
1:2:30,15 --> 1:2:35,49
should be rewarded. My father came to this
country, my grandfather came to this country.


856
1:2:35,49 --> 1:2:40,849
He left my dad behind for five years. My dad
was without a dad for almost the first five


857
1:2:40,849 --> 1:2:45,229
years of his life. And there are millions
of stories across America of people making


858
1:2:45,229 --> 1:2:49,829
sacrifices because America was worth it to
do it the right way. You come to this country


859
1:2:49,829 --> 1:2:54,63
and the first thing you do is to respect our
laws. If you want to be an American, you respect


860
1:2:54,63 --> 1:2:59,439
the laws of America, and you do so continually
while you're here. We reward that kind of


861
1:2:59,439 --> 1:3:4,429
behavior. We don't reward behavior where you
don't respect our laws in your initial act


862
1:3:4,429 --> 1:3:7,459
and then you continually break the laws in
order to stay here.


863
1:3:7,459 --> 1:3:11,119
>> SMITH: Speaker Gingrich, in Iowa you were
a big supporter of ethanol subsidies. Here


864
1:3:11,119 --> 1:3:15,449
in Florida, sugar is a very important industry,
and it's subsidized, as well, with import


865
1:3:15,449 --> 1:3:20,579
restrictions, quotas. There's a conservative
movement to do away with these programs. In


866
1:3:20,579 --> 1:3:25,39
the case of sugar, critics say it -- it adds
billions of dollars to -- to consumers' grocery


867
1:3:25,39 --> 1:3:27,44
bills every year. What would you do about
that?


868
1:3:27,44 --> 1:3:30,939
>> GINGRICH: Well, I pretty enthusiastically
early in my career kept trying to figure out


869
1:3:30,939 --> 1:3:34,859
how to get away from the sugar subsidy. And
I found out one of -- one of the fascinating


870
1:3:34,859 --> 1:3:39,679
things about America, which was that cane
sugar hides behind beet sugar. And there are


871
1:3:39,679 --> 1:3:44,589
just too many beet sugar districts in the
United States. It's an amazing side story


872
1:3:44,589 --> 1:3:50,549
about how interest groups operate. In an ideal
world, you would have an open market. And


873
1:3:50,549 --> 1:3:54,429
that's -- I think that would be a better future
and, frankly, one where cane sugar would still


874
1:3:54,429 --> 1:3:58,319
make a lot of money. But it's very hard to
imagine how you're going to get there. I spent


875
1:3:58,319 --> 1:4:2,279
a lot of time trying to reform agriculture
when I was speaker. And I would say it was


876
1:4:2,279 --> 1:4:6,359
one of the two or three hardest things to
try to do because the -- the capacity of the


877
1:4:6,359 --> 1:4:9,179
agricultural groups to defend themselves is
pretty amazing.


878
1:4:9,179 --> 1:4:12,65
>> SMITH: Governor Romney, you're going some
campaign support from sugar growers. It's


879
1:4:12,65 --> 1:4:15,749
a very influential group in this state. What's
your view on the sugar subsidies?


880
1:4:15,749 --> 1:4:19,709
>> ROMNEY: Yeah, my view is, we ought to get
rid of subsidies and let markets work properly.


881
1:4:19,709 --> 1:4:23,319
But let's step back for a second, talk about
what's really going on in Florida right now.


882
1:4:23,319 --> 1:4:27,419
And you know, you both know what's going on
here. I spent time this morning with -- with


883
1:4:27,419 --> 1:4:31,15
eight different individuals, listening to
them talk about their circumstances. There


884
1:4:31,15 --> 1:4:35,89
are a lot of people in Florida that are hurting.
You got a lot of homes underwater. This president


885
1:4:35,89 --> 1:4:40,519
came into office saying he'd turn this economy
around, and everything he has done has made


886
1:4:40,519 --> 1:4:46,929
it harder for the people of Florida. We have
25 million Americans out of work. We have,


887
1:4:46,929 --> 1:4:52,289
in Florida, 9.9 percent unemployed. We have
18 percent of our people in this state that


888
1:4:52,289 --> 1:4:57,319
are underemployed. Home values, 40 percent
are underwater. This president has failed


889
1:4:57,319 --> 1:5:1,929
miserably the people of Florida. His plans
for NASA, he has no plans for NASA. The space


890
1:5:1,929 --> 1:5:7,14
coast is -- is struggling. This president
has failed the people of Florida. We have


891
1:5:7,14 --> 1:5:11,88
to have a president who understands how to
get an economy going again. He does not. He


892
1:5:11,88 --> 1:5:17,13
plays 90 rounds of golf when you have 25 million
people out of work. He says gasoline prices


893
1:5:17,13 --> 1:5:22,699
doubled during his presidency. He says don't
build a Keystone pipeline. We have $15 trillion


894
1:5:22,699 --> 1:5:26,64
of debt. We're headed to a -- to a Greece-
type collapse, and he adds another trillion


895
1:5:26,64 --> 1:5:31,359
on top for Obamacare and for his stimulus
plan that didn't create private-sector jobs.


896
1:5:31,359 --> 1:5:36,89
This president has failed. And this economy
needs a president who understands this economy.


897
1:5:36,89 --> 1:5:39,15
>> SMITH: Congressman Paul, Florida's Everglades
provide one in three Floridians with their


898
1:5:39,15 --> 1:5:43,819
drinking water. It affects thousands of jobs.
Right now, there's a -- there's a joint federal-state


899
1:5:43,819 --> 1:5:48,329
program to save what's left of the Everglades.
Would you commit to continuing that federal


900
1:5:48,329 --> 1:5:50,29
financing of the Everglades preservation?


901
1:5:50,29 --> 1:5:54,609
>> PAUL: Sure. I -- I don't see any reason
to go after that. I would still look into


902
1:5:54,609 --> 1:5:59,569
the details on whether that could be a state
issue or not. But with all the wars going


903
1:5:59,569 --> 1:6:5,869
on, and the economy is in shambles, as it
is, and the unemployment, to -- to worry about


904
1:6:5,869 --> 1:6:9,529
dealing with that program, we could do it
in a theoretical sense. But I would see no


905
1:6:9,529 --> 1:6:16,64
reason to, you know, complicate things. But
I wouldn't have any desire to interfere with


906
1:6:16,64 --> 1:6:16,89
that.


907
1:6:16,89 --> 1:6:22,959
>> WILLIAMS: At this point, we'll take another
break. We'll return from Tampa with this line


908
1:6:22,959 --> 1:6:25,289
of questioning right after this.


909
1:6:25,289 --> 1:6:25,759
>> [APPLAUSE]


910
1:6:25,759 --> 1:6:26,689
>> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]


911
1:6:26,689 --> 1:6:32,15
>> WILLIAMS: We are back from Tampa tonight.
As the conversation continues, once again


912
1:6:32,15 --> 1:6:45,999
the questioning continues. Adam Smith of "The
Tampa Bay Times."


913
1:6:45,999 --> 1:6:50,419
>> SMITH: Thank you. Senator Santorum, in
2005, Florida was in the middle of a huge


914
1:6:50,419 --> 1:6:54,359
national debate over Terri Schiavo, whether
her feeding tube should be removed after the


915
1:6:54,359 --> 1:6:59,509
courts had ruled that she had been in a vegetative
state for years. You were at the center, at


916
1:6:59,509 --> 1:7:4,779
the front of advocating congressional intervention
to keep her alive. You even came down here,


917
1:7:4,779 --> 1:7:10,579
came to her bedside after a fund-raiser. Why
should the government have more say in medical


918
1:7:10,579 --> 1:7:12,259
decisions like that than a spouse?


919
1:7:12,259 --> 1:7:15,779
>> SANTORUM: Well, number one, I didn't come
to her bedside, but I did come down to Tampa.


920
1:7:15,779 --> 1:7:20,259
I was scheduled to come down anyway for that
event, and it so happened that this situation


921
1:7:20,259 --> 1:7:26,169
was going on. I did not call for congressional
intervention. I called for a judicial hearing


922
1:7:26,169 --> 1:7:33,319
by an impartial judge at the federal level
to review a case in which you had parents


923
1:7:33,319 --> 1:7:39,229
and a spouse on different sides of the issue.
And these were constituents of mine. The parents


924
1:7:39,229 --> 1:7:44,749
happen to live in Pennsylvania, and they came
to me and made a very strong case that they


925
1:7:44,749 --> 1:7:49,439
would like to see some other pair of eyes,
judicial eyes, look at it. And I agreed to


926
1:7:49,439 --> 1:7:56,259
advocate for those constituents because I
believe that we should give respect and dignity


927
1:7:56,259 --> 1:8:0,259
for all human life, irrespective of their
condition. And if there was someone there


928
1:8:0,259 --> 1:8:4,519
that wanted to provide and take care of them,
and they were willing to do so, I wanted to


929
1:8:4,519 --> 1:8:8,169
make sure that the judicial proceedings worked
properly. And that's what I did, and I would


930
1:8:8,169 --> 1:8:10,13
do it again.


931
1:8:10,13 --> 1:8:16,23
>> SMITH: Do not resuscitate directives, do
you think they're immoral?


932
1:8:16,23 --> 1:8:21,38
>> SANTORUM: No, I don't believe they're immoral.
I mean, I think that's a decision that people


933
1:8:21,38 --> 1:8:26,29
should be able to make, and I have supported
legislation in the past for them to make it.


934
1:8:26,29 --> 1:8:30,489
>> SMITH: Speaker Gingrich, in that case the
courts had ruled repeatedly. How does that


935
1:8:30,489 --> 1:8:34,0
square, the Terri Schiavo, action with your
understanding of the Constitution and separation


936
1:8:34,0 --> 1:8:34,469
of powers?


937
1:8:34,469 --> 1:8:40,219
>> GINGRICH: Well, look, I think that we go
to extraordinary lengths, for example, for


938
1:8:40,219 --> 1:8:45,539
people who are on murderers row. They have
extraordinary rights of appeal. And you have


939
1:8:45,539 --> 1:8:50,409
here somebody who was in a coma, who had,
on the one hand, her husband saying let her


940
1:8:50,409 --> 1:8:55,779
die and her parents saying let her live. Now,
it strikes me that having a bias in favor


941
1:8:55,779 --> 1:9:1,39
of life, and at least going to a federal hearing,
which would be automatic if it was a criminal


942
1:9:1,39 --> 1:9:6,799
on death row, that it's not too much to say
in some circumstances your rights as an American


943
1:9:6,799 --> 1:9:11,699
citizen ought to be respected. And there ought
to be at least a judicial review of whether


944
1:9:11,699 --> 1:9:16,449
or not in that circumstance you should be
allowed to die, which has nothing to do with


945
1:9:16,449 --> 1:9:22,389
whether or not you as a citizen have a right
to have your own end-of-life prescription


946
1:9:22,389 --> 1:9:26,949
which is totally appropriate for you to do
as a matter of your values in consultation


947
1:9:26,949 --> 1:9:27,739
with your doctor.


948
1:9:27,739 --> 1:9:31,569
>> SMITH: Congressman Paul, you're a doctor.
What was your view of the Terri Schiavo case?


949
1:9:31,569 --> 1:9:37,5
>> PAUL: I find it so unfortunate, so unusual,
too. That situation doesn't come up very often.


950
1:9:37,5 --> 1:9:44,429
It should teach us all a lesson to have living
wills or a good conversation with a spouse.


951
1:9:44,429 --> 1:9:50,159
I would want my spouse to make the decision.
And -- but it's better to have a living will.


952
1:9:50,159 --> 1:9:55,67
But I don't like going up the ladder. You
know, we go to the federal courts, and the


953
1:9:55,67 --> 1:10:0,329
Congress, and on up. Yes, difficult decisions.
Will it be perfect for everybody? No. But


954
1:10:0,329 --> 1:10:5,409
I would have preferred to see the decision
made at the state level. But I've been involved


955
1:10:5,409 --> 1:10:11,5
in medicine with things similar, but not quite
as difficult as this. But usually, we deferred


956
1:10:11,5 --> 1:10:19,39
to the family. And it wasn't made a big issue
like this was. This was way out of proportion


957
1:10:19,39 --> 1:10:24,869
to what happens more routinely. But I think
it should urge us all to try to plan for this


958
1:10:24,869 --> 1:10:30,26
and make sure either that one individual that's
closest to you makes the decision or you sign


959
1:10:30,26 --> 1:10:33,7
a living will. And this would have solved
the whole problem.


960
1:10:33,7 --> 1:10:34,65
>> SMITH: Beth?


961
1:10:34,65 --> 1:10:39,179
>> REINHARD: Governor Romney, this is the
state that put the first men on the moon.


962
1:10:39,179 --> 1:10:43,389
America right now has no way to put people
into space except to hitch a ride with the


963
1:10:43,389 --> 1:10:48,489
Russians. Meanwhile, the Chinese are ramping
up their space program. At a time when you


964
1:10:48,489 --> 1:10:53,349
all want to shrink federal spending, should
space exploration be a priority? Governor


965
1:10:53,349 --> 1:10:53,55
Romney?


966
1:10:53,55 --> 1:10:57,449
>> ROMNEY: It should certainly be a priority.
What we have right now is a president who


967
1:10:57,449 --> 1:11:2,44
does not have a vision or a mission for NASA.
And as a result of that, there are people


968
1:11:2,44 --> 1:11:6,8
on the space coast that are suffering. And
Florida itself is -- is suffering as a result.


969
1:11:6,8 --> 1:11:11,239
So what's the right way forward? Well, I happen
to believe our space program is important


970
1:11:11,239 --> 1:11:15,25
not only for science, but also for commercial
development and for military development.


971
1:11:15,25 --> 1:11:19,4
And I believe the right mission for -- for
NASA should be determined by a president together


972
1:11:19,4 --> 1:11:24,119
with a collection of people from those different
areas, from NASA, from the Air Force space


973
1:11:24,119 --> 1:11:30,309
program, from our leading universities, and
from commercial enterprises, bring them together,


974
1:11:30,309 --> 1:11:34,28
discuss a wide range of options for NASA,
and then -- and then have NASA not just funded


975
1:11:34,28 --> 1:11:38,71
by the federal government, but also by commercial
enterprises. Have some of the research done


976
1:11:38,71 --> 1:11:43,67
in our universities. Let's have a collaborative
effort with business, with -- with government,


977
1:11:43,67 --> 1:11:48,75
with a military, as well as with our educational
institutions. Have a mission, once again excite


978
1:11:48,75 --> 1:11:53,48
our young people about the potential of space
and the commercial potential will pay for


979
1:11:53,48 --> 1:11:58,949
itself down the road. This is a great opportunity.
Florida has technology. The people here on


980
1:11:58,949 --> 1:12:3,76
the space coast have technology and vision
and passion that America needs. And with a


981
1:12:3,76 --> 1:12:8,199
president that is actually willing to create
a mission and a vision for -- for NASA and


982
1:12:8,199 --> 1:12:10,61
for space, we can continue to lead the world.


983
1:12:10,61 --> 1:12:15,219
>> REINHARD: Speaker Gingrich, would you put
more tax dollars into the space race and commit


984
1:12:15,219 --> 1:12:19,82
to putting an American on Mars, instead of
relying on the private sector?


985
1:12:19,82 --> 1:12:26,76
>> GINGRICH: Well, the two are not incompatible.
For example, most of the great breakthroughs


986
1:12:26,76 --> 1:12:31,3
in aviation in the '20s and '30s were as a
result of prizes. Lindbergh flew to Paris


987
1:12:31,3 --> 1:12:37,25
for a $25,000 prize. I would like to see vastly
more of the money spent encouraging the private


988
1:12:37,25 --> 1:12:43,26
sector into very aggressive experimentation.
And I'd like a leaner NASA. I don't think


989
1:12:43,26 --> 1:12:47,23
building a bigger bureaucracy and having a
greater number of people sit in rooms and


990
1:12:47,23 --> 1:12:52,5
talk gets you there. But if we had a series
of goals that we were prepared to offer prizes


991
1:12:52,5 --> 1:12:56,1
for, there's every reason to believe you have
a lot of folks in this country and around


992
1:12:56,1 --> 1:13:0,65
the world who would put up an amazing amount
of money and would make the space coast literally


993
1:13:0,65 --> 1:13:6,7
hum with activity because they'd be drawn
to achieve these prizes. Going back to the


994
1:13:6,7 --> 1:13:11,449
moon permanently, getting to Mars as rapidly
as possible, building a series of space stations


995
1:13:11,449 --> 1:13:15,159
and developing commercial space, there are
a whole series of things you can do that could


996
1:13:15,159 --> 1:13:19,659
be dynamic that are more than just better
government bureaucracy. They're fundamentally


997
1:13:19,659 --> 1:13:24,679
leapfrogging into a world where you're incentivizing
people who are visionaries and people in the


998
1:13:24,679 --> 1:13:30,389
private sector to invest very large amounts
of money in finding very romantic and exciting


999
1:13:30,389 --> 1:13:30,88
futures.


1000
1:13:30,88 --> 1:13:34,929
>> REINHARD: Speaker Gingrich, I have another
question for you on another topic. You've


1001
1:13:34,929 --> 1:13:40,369
talked about the millions of jobs created
by the Reagan tax cuts. If tax cuts create


1002
1:13:40,369 --> 1:13:42,8
jobs, why didn't the Bush tax cuts work?


1003
1:13:42,8 --> 1:13:46,42
>> GINGRICH: Well, the Bush tax cuts, I think
in a period of great difficulty, with the


1004
1:13:46,42 --> 1:13:51,4
attack of 9/11, actually stopped us from going
into a much deeper slump. I think we would


1005
1:13:51,4 --> 1:13:54,579
have been in much, much worse shape, and I
think most economists agree, that in 2002


1006
1:13:54,579 --> 1:13:59,409
and '03 and '04 we'd have been in much worse
shape without the Bush tax cuts. But -- but


1007
1:13:59,409 --> 1:14:3,32
you have to also look at the regulatory burden.
The reason I called for repealing Dodd-Frank


1008
1:14:3,32 --> 1:14:8,7
and for repealing Obamacare and for repealing
Sarbanes-Oxley is you now have these huge


1009
1:14:8,7 --> 1:14:13,7
layers of paperwork and government intervention
and bureaucratic micromanagement that are


1010
1:14:13,7 --> 1:14:17,55
crippling the American system and are making
it much harder for us to create the kind of


1011
1:14:17,55 --> 1:14:23,289
jobs we'd want. In North Dakota today, we
have a boom in oil development, unemployment


1012
1:14:23,289 --> 1:14:28,59
is down to 3.2 percent. They have had seven
straight tax cuts at the state level because


1013
1:14:28,59 --> 1:14:33,76
the oil was on private land. If that oil had
been on public land, the environmentalists


1014
1:14:33,76 --> 1:14:38,369
and Barack Obama would have stopped its development,
and North Dakota would be mired in 8 percent


1015
1:14:38,369 --> 1:14:43,28
or 9 percent unemployment. So, get the regulations
out of the way, get the tax incentives right,


1016
1:14:43,28 --> 1:14:46,48
and you can get back to creating an amazing
number of jobs very fast.


1017
1:14:46,48 --> 1:14:51,59
>> WILLIAMS: To my fellow questioners, our
panelists tonight, my thanks. So ends this


1018
1:14:51,59 --> 1:14:57,159
section of our conversation. The final bit
of our debate from Tampa tonight coming up


1019
1:14:57,159 --> 1:15:2,5
after this last break.


1020
1:15:2,5 --> 1:15:5,119
>> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]


1021
1:15:5,119 --> 1:15:17,969
>> WILLIAMS: Welcome back to Tampa for this
final section of our conversation tonight.


1022
1:15:17,969 --> 1:15:21,559
We're back down to the five of us here on
stage. I thought we'd talk a little bit more


1023
1:15:21,559 --> 1:15:28,26
big picture. This has been called, in addition
to this unprecedented primary contest the


1024
1:15:28,26 --> 1:15:34,34
GOP is in the midst of, a battle for the soul
of the Republican Party. Governor Romney,


1025
1:15:34,34 --> 1:15:42,39
the question is, about that soul, what have
you done to further the cause of conservativism


1026
1:15:42,39 --> 1:15:43,479
as a Republican leader?


1027
1:15:43,479 --> 1:15:48,57
>> ROMNEY: Well, number one, I've raised a
family. And I've -- I've -- with my wife,


1028
1:15:48,57 --> 1:15:54,3
we've raised five wonderful sons, and we have
16 wonderful grandkids. Number two, I've worked


1029
1:15:54,3 --> 1:15:58,199
in the private sector. The idea that somehow
everything important for conservativism or


1030
1:15:58,199 --> 1:16:2,44
for America happens in government is simply
wrong. I've been in the private sector. I


1031
1:16:2,44 --> 1:16:6,82
worked in one business that was in trouble
and helped turn it around. Another I started.


1032
1:16:6,82 --> 1:16:10,71
And as part of that, we were able to create
thousands and thousands of jobs. And then


1033
1:16:10,71 --> 1:16:14,659
I took an opportunity to become governor of
a state that was slightly Democrat. About


1034
1:16:14,659 --> 1:16:20,99
85 percent of my legislature was Democrat.
And I worked very hard to promote a conservative


1035
1:16:20,99 --> 1:16:25,2
agenda. We cut taxes 19 times. We balanced
the budget every year, put in place a rainy


1036
1:16:25,2 --> 1:16:30,369
day fund of over $2 billion by the time I
left. We were also successful in having English


1037
1:16:30,369 --> 1:16:34,739
immersion in our schools, driving our schools
to be number one in the nation. That kind


1038
1:16:34,739 --> 1:16:39,849
of conservative model in a state like Massachusetts
was a model in many respects that other states


1039
1:16:39,849 --> 1:16:44,389
could look at and say, "OK, conservative principles
work." We were able to reach across the aisle


1040
1:16:44,389 --> 1:16:48,559
to fight for conservative principles, and
now I'm taking that to a presidential campaign,


1041
1:16:48,559 --> 1:16:52,5
wrote a book about those principles that lay
out why I believe they're right for America.


1042
1:16:52,5 --> 1:16:55,9
>> WILLIAMS: Mr. Speaker, you've been talking
a lot about conservative principles in this


1043
1:16:55,9 --> 1:16:58,989
campaign so far. Is that enough for you? Is
that good enough?


1044
1:16:58,989 --> 1:17:2,719
>> GINGRICH: Look, I don't want to spend my
time commenting on Mitt. I'd like to just


1045
1:17:2,719 --> 1:17:7,84
tell you that I started -- I went to a Goldwater
organizing session in 1964. I met with Ronald


1046
1:17:7,84 --> 1:17:12,239
Reagan for the first time in 1974. I worked
with Jack Kemp and Art Laffer and others to


1047
1:17:12,239 --> 1:17:16,869
develop supply-side economics in the late
'70s. I helped Governor Reagan become President


1048
1:17:16,869 --> 1:17:21,889
Reagan. I helped pass the Reagan economic
program when I worked with the National Security


1049
1:17:21,889 --> 1:17:26,76
Council on issues involving the collapse of
the Soviet empire. I then came back, organized


1050
1:17:26,76 --> 1:17:30,71
a group called GOPAC, spent 16 years building
a majority in the House for the first time


1051
1:17:30,71 --> 1:17:37,159
since 1954, the first re-elected majority
since 1928, developed the Conservative Opportunity


1052
1:17:37,159 --> 1:17:41,909
Society, talked about big ideas, big solutions.
So I think it's fair to say I've spent most


1053
1:17:41,909 --> 1:17:47,1
of my lifetime trying to develop a conservative
movement across this country that relates


1054
1:17:47,1 --> 1:17:52,369
directly to what we have to do. And I think
only a genuine conservative who's in a position


1055
1:17:52,369 --> 1:17:58,719
to debate Obama and to show how wide the gap
is between Obama's policies and conservativism


1056
1:17:58,719 --> 1:18:2,989
can, in fact, win, because he's going to spend
a billion dollars trying to smear whoever


1057
1:18:2,989 --> 1:18:7,309
the nominee is. And we'd better be prepared
to beat him in the debate and prove exactly


1058
1:18:7,309 --> 1:18:10,64
how wrong his values are and how wrong his
practices are.


1059
1:18:10,64 --> 1:18:16,5
>> WILLIAMS: Which, Senator Santorum, gets
us back to electability, the gap between the


1060
1:18:16,5 --> 1:18:20,98
Republican Party and the president. Some of
the newspaper headlines about this gathering


1061
1:18:20,98 --> 1:18:25,9
we were going to have tonight, in Florida,
Romney seeks to link Gingrich to foreclosure


1062
1:18:25,9 --> 1:18:30,8
crisis. And here's a second one: The verdict
is in, Mitt Romney's Bain Capital problem


1063
1:18:30,8 --> 1:18:35,92
is real. What's the net effect of all this,
of the tax release tomorrow, of Freddie -- the


1064
1:18:35,92 --> 1:18:41,11
Freddie Mac release tonight on your party,
say your candidacy, as you try to go forward?


1065
1:18:41,11 --> 1:18:44,42
>> SANTORUM: Well, I would say that there
are more fundamental issues than that, where


1066
1:18:44,42 --> 1:18:49,889
there's a gap and a problem with two of the
gentlemen who are up here with me. And one


1067
1:18:49,889 --> 1:18:53,53
is on the biggest issue that they -- we have
to deal with in this election, that's -- that's


1068
1:18:53,53 --> 1:18:58,26
crushing the economy, will crush it even further
and crush freedom, and that's Obamacare. Governor


1069
1:18:58,26 --> 1:19:3,46
Romney's plan in Massachusetts was the basis
for Obamacare. Speaker Gingrich for 20 years


1070
1:19:3,46 --> 1:19:8,86
supported a federal individual mandate, something
that Pam Bondi is now going to the Supreme


1071
1:19:8,86 --> 1:19:13,51
Court saying is unconstitutional. Speaker
Gingrich, for 20 years, up until last year


1072
1:19:13,51 --> 1:19:19,7
supported an individual mandate, which is
at the core of Obamacare. If you look at cap-and-trade,


1073
1:19:19,7 --> 1:19:22,59
Governor Romney was very proud to say that
he was the first state in the country as governor


1074
1:19:22,59 --> 1:19:28,369
to sign a cap on CO-2 emissions, the first
state in the country to put a cap believing


1075
1:19:28,369 --> 1:19:33,389
in -- in global warming and criticized Republicans
for not believing in it, as did, by the way,


1076
1:19:33,389 --> 1:19:38,239
Speaker Gingrich, who was for a cap-and-trade
program with incentives, business incentives,


1077
1:19:38,239 --> 1:19:42,13
but was for the rubric of cap-and-trade, not
specifically the cap-and-trade bill that was


1078
1:19:42,13 --> 1:19:49,84
out there. Again, huge, huge differences between
my position and where President Obama is,


1079
1:19:49,84 --> 1:19:53,5
but not so on two major issues. You go down
and you look at the Wall Street bailouts,


1080
1:19:53,5 --> 1:19:58,42
I said before, here's one where you had folks
who preach conservativism, private sector,


1081
1:19:58,42 --> 1:20:3,46
and when push came to shove, they got pushed.
They didn't stand tall for the conservative


1082
1:20:3,46 --> 1:20:7,32
principles that they argued that they were
for. And as a result, we ended up with this


1083
1:20:7,32 --> 1:20:12,309
bailout that has injected government into
business like it had never been done before.


1084
1:20:12,309 --> 1:20:16,989
>> SANTORUM: They rejected conservativism
when it was hard to stand. It's going to be


1085
1:20:16,989 --> 1:20:20,559
hard to stand whoever this president is going
to be elected. It's going to be tough. There


1086
1:20:20,559 --> 1:20:25,7
is going to be a mountain of problems. It's
going to be easy to be able to bail out and


1087
1:20:25,7 --> 1:20:29,449
compromise your principles. We have gentlemen
here on the three issues that got the Tea


1088
1:20:29,449 --> 1:20:34,829
Party started, that are the base of the conservative
movement now in the Republican Party. And


1089
1:20:34,829 --> 1:20:39,7
there is no difference between President Obama
and these two gentlemen. And that's why this


1090
1:20:39,7 --> 1:20:44,96
election in Florida is so critical, that we
have someone that actually can create a contrast


1091
1:20:44,96 --> 1:20:47,51
between the president and the conservative
point of view.


1092
1:20:47,51 --> 1:20:51,659
>> WILLIAMS: Congressmen Paul, are the two
men in the middle insufficiently conservative


1093
1:20:51,659 --> 1:20:52,3
for you?


1094
1:20:52,3 --> 1:20:57,38
>> PAUL: Well, I think the problem is, is
nobody has defined what being conservative


1095
1:20:57,38 --> 1:20:57,51
means.


1096
1:20:57,51 --> 1:20:57,909
>> WILLIAMS: Go ahead.


1097
1:20:57,909 --> 1:21:1,69
>> PAUL: And I think that is our problem.
Conservative means we have a smaller government


1098
1:21:1,69 --> 1:21:7,219
and more liberty. And yet, if you ask, what
have we done? I think we have lost our way.


1099
1:21:7,219 --> 1:21:11,3
Our rhetoric is still pretty good, but when
we get in charge, we expand the government.


1100
1:21:11,3 --> 1:21:17,59
You talk about Dodd-Frank, but we gave Sarbanes-Oxley.
We gave debts as well, you know, when we're


1101
1:21:17,59 --> 1:21:21,9
in charge. So, if it means limited government,
you have to ask the basic question, what should


1102
1:21:21,9 --> 1:21:24,389
the role of government be? The founders asked
that question, had a revolution and wrote


1103
1:21:24,389 --> 1:21:29,34
a Constitution. And they said the role of
government ought to be to protect liberty.


1104
1:21:29,34 --> 1:21:34,659
It's not to run a welfare state and not to
be the policemen of the world. And so if you're


1105
1:21:34,659 --> 1:21:40,9
a conservative, how can you be conservative
and cut food stamps, but you won't cut spending


1106
1:21:40,9 --> 1:21:44,5
overseas? There is not a nickel or a penny
that anybody will cut on the conservative


1107
1:21:44,5 --> 1:21:48,4
side, overseas spending. And we don't have
the money. They are willing to start more


1108
1:21:48,4 --> 1:21:52,489
wars. So, I say, if you're conservative, you
want small government across the board, especially


1109
1:21:52,489 --> 1:21:57,949
in personal liberty. What's wrong with having
the government out of our personal lives?


1110
1:21:57,949 --> 1:22:2,9
So, this is what -- we have to decide what
conservative means, what limited government


1111
1:22:2,9 --> 1:22:6,159
means. And I have a simple suggestion. We
have a pretty good guide, and if we follow


1112
1:22:6,159 --> 1:22:10,82
the Constitution, government would be very
small and we would all be devoted conservatives.


1113
1:22:10,82 --> 1:22:15,53
>> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, again tonight,
so called Romneycare and so-called Obamacare


1114
1:22:15,53 --> 1:22:21,159
have been positioned very closely side by
side by your opponent, the senator. And again,


1115
1:22:21,159 --> 1:22:23,15
you have been called insufficiently conservative.


1116
1:22:23,15 --> 1:22:27,659
>> ROMNEY: You know, I have a record. You
can look at my record. I just described what


1117
1:22:27,659 --> 1:22:31,289
I had accomplished in Massachusetts. It's
a conservative record. Also, the fun of running


1118
1:22:31,289 --> 1:22:35,51
against Ted Kennedy. What a great thrill that
was. I didn't beat him, but he had to take


1119
1:22:35,51 --> 1:22:39,469
a mortgage out on his house to make sure that
he could defeat me. I believe that the policies


1120
1:22:39,469 --> 1:22:44,179
he put in place had hurt America and helped
create a permanent underclass in this country.


1121
1:22:44,179 --> 1:22:48,59
My health care plan, by the way, is one that
under our Constitution we're allowed to have.


1122
1:22:48,59 --> 1:22:52,8
The people in our state chose a plan which
I think is working for our state. At the time


1123
1:22:52,8 --> 1:22:55,949
we crafted it, I was asked time and again,
"Is this something that you would have the


1124
1:22:55,949 --> 1:23:1,3
federal government do?" I said absolutely
not. I do not support a federal mandate. I


1125
1:23:1,3 --> 1:23:5,809
do not support a federal one-size-fits-all
plan. I believe in the Constitution. That's


1126
1:23:5,809 --> 1:23:11,39
why the attorney general here is saying absolutely
not. You can't impose Obamacare on the states.


1127
1:23:11,39 --> 1:23:16,199
What I will do if I'm president, I will repeal
Obamacare and return to the states the authority


1128
1:23:16,199 --> 1:23:20,609
and the rights the states have to craft their
own programs to care for their own poor.


1129
1:23:20,609 --> 1:23:24,159
>> WILLIAMS: Speaker Gingrich, I know none
of you believe in polls, but as we came in


1130
1:23:24,159 --> 1:23:31,55
here tonight, of the numbers in the known
world, your numbers were on the rise. What


1131
1:23:31,55 --> 1:23:37,13
scares you about the presidency if you made
it to the job you want?


1132
1:23:37,13 --> 1:23:42,969
>> GINGRICH: I actually agree with what Rick
Santorum said. I believe that whoever the


1133
1:23:42,969 --> 1:23:48,26
next president is, if we're going to get America
back on the right track, is going to face


1134
1:23:48,26 --> 1:23:55,19
enormous, difficult problems, some of which
have been accurately diagnosed by Dr. Paul.


1135
1:23:55,19 --> 1:24:3,409
And the fact is that we have tremendous institutional
biases against doing the right thing and against


1136
1:24:3,409 --> 1:24:9,17
getting things done. And we have huge interest
groups who would rather preside over the wreckage


1137
1:24:9,17 --> 1:24:13,3
than lose their favored position by helping
the country. So I always tell audiences I


1138
1:24:13,3 --> 1:24:17,309
never ask anyone to be for me. Because if
they are for me, they vote yes and go home


1139
1:24:17,309 --> 1:24:21,539
and say, I sure hope Newt does it. I ask people
to be with me, because I think this will be


1140
1:24:21,539 --> 1:24:27,1
a very hard, very difficult journey. And I
find it a very humbling and a very sobering


1141
1:24:27,1 --> 1:24:31,489
thought that one would have to try to get
America back on the right track despite all


1142
1:24:31,489 --> 1:24:33,95
of our elites and all of our entrenched bureaucracies.


1143
1:24:33,95 --> 1:24:39,82
>> WILLIAMS: Governor Romney, you talk about
restoring America's greatness. Given that,


1144
1:24:39,82 --> 1:24:44,409
in your view when was America last great?


1145
1:24:44,409 --> 1:24:50,99
>> ROMNEY: America still is great, but we
have a lot of people suffering. We have people


1146
1:24:50,99 --> 1:24:53,46
that are underemployed that shouldn't be,
unemployed that shouldn't be. Home values


1147
1:24:53,46 --> 1:24:58,679
continue to go down. We have the median income
in this country has declined 10 percent in


1148
1:24:58,679 --> 1:25:2,76
the last four years. We're still a great nation,
but a great nation doesn't have so many people


1149
1:25:2,76 --> 1:25:8,699
suffering. And I'm running in part because
I have experience in how the economy works.


1150
1:25:8,699 --> 1:25:13,349
And I want to use that experience to get people
working again, to get our economy working


1151
1:25:13,349 --> 1:25:17,789
again. And the idea to get our economy working
is not to have the government play a more


1152
1:25:17,789 --> 1:25:22,309
intrusive role in how our economy works, but
instead to do the seven things that always


1153
1:25:22,309 --> 1:25:28,449
get an economy going: get taxes competitive,
regulation as modest as possible and modernized,


1154
1:25:28,449 --> 1:25:32,889
get ourselves energy independent, open up
trade with other nations and crack down on


1155
1:25:32,889 --> 1:25:36,489
cheaters, make sure we don't have crony capitalism
-- that's what we have going on right now


1156
1:25:36,489 --> 1:25:41,909
-- build human capital through education,
and also finally balance the budget. People


1157
1:25:41,909 --> 1:25:46,489
will not invest in an economy and create new
jobs if they think we're going to hit a Greece-like


1158
1:25:46,489 --> 1:25:50,309
wall. I will do those seven things and get
America working again.


1159
1:25:50,309 --> 1:25:55,469
>> WILLIAMS: I want to thank all of our candidates
and our hosts, of course, here at the University


1160
1:25:55,469 --> 1:25:58,559
of South Florida. We are obligated at this
point to say, "Go Bulls."


1161
1:25:58,559 --> 1:25:58,569
>> [APPLAUSE]


1162
1:25:58,569 --> 1:25:58,65
>> WILLIAMS: For our hosts here, for our viewers
here on your NBC station, our coverage will


1163
1:25:58,65 --> 1:25:58,739
continue. I'll be back with you shortly. But
for now, let's go over to David Gregory to


1164
1:25:58,739 --> 1:25:58,84
take a look at part of what transpired here
on stage tonight with our thanks to you all.


1165
1:25:58,84 --> 1:27:58,84
Thank you very much.
