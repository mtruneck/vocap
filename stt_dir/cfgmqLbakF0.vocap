###10 I say it's over, unless there are other questions that you have
###15 which you don't understand.
###18 This is the application of relativity, that all things are relative.
###22 You can't know exactly the way things work.
###26 You can only know what you can receive.
###29 There's a gadget that scientists use
###32 to see if there's an electromagnetic field here.
###37 They also have a gadget they lower from an airplane
###40 (like a big disk) with an electric current going around in a circle.
###44 There's a lot of iron under the land
###47 and it slows up the electric current.
###49 Instead of going around geologically looking for iron
###53 the airplane drops this down, and it flies over the Earth
###57 and it tells you where the iron is
###60 (do you understand? ) by a current moving around in a coil.
###65 It's called a magnetometer.
###68 That's how they know.
###71 In the old days they used to dig down, find metals and say
###73 "This is a good place for it!"
###75 Nowadays, with a prism, a certain type of prism
###79 arranged in a certain way, if you aim it at a star.
###83 It tells us there's no oxygen on that star
###85 no nitrogen, no water.
###88 The prism, the color bands, tell you what there is on that planet.
###93 It was discovered accidentally
###95 when the Germans made airplanes that were lighter and stronger.
###100 They didn't know what it was made of. They heat the metal
###104 so it's bright white hot and run it through a prism.
###108 They get a color band, and the color band says:
###110 2% magnesium, 1% carbon, cobalt
###115 (you know what I mean?). It's called spectral analysis.
###118 We can turn a spectrum on anything today
###123 and if we heat it so it's white hot, we can tell what it contains.
###128 That's how they knew there's no air on the moon
###130 before they ever went there, but normal people [ask]
###133 "How did they know there's no air on the moon? They've never been there!"
###136 There are other ways, but they don't know about spectroscopes.
###141 Do you know about spectral analysis?
###143 A lot of people don't know about those things, so they [say]:
###146 "How the hell do they know? My opinion is just as good as theirs!"
###150 They don't look into it and say "How do they know?"
###154 They speculate, you know what I mean?
###156 That's why we have so much trouble with people
###160 because they do not have a common way of seeking information.
###164 They say "If you ask me, I think my opinion's just as good as yours."
###171 Good.
###173 People want to feel equal to you.
###176 They say "That's your opinion, now I'm going to give you mine."
###180 They think one opinion is as good as another
###183 and that's valid amongst people that don't know how to check things out.
###188 They should say "I wonder how they know there's no water on the moon"
###192 but wondering that, they don't go to their computer and say
###196 "How do people know that?"
###199 I don't know if your computer will handle that
###201 but your computer will tell you every phase
###205 of metals with a memory. If you put in
###209 'metals with a memory' or you put in 'materials with a memory'
###213 you'll get more than metals with a memory.
###216 If you put in 'What is memory?'
###220 (you know what I mean? ) That's another question altogether.
###224 We don't ask those questions
###226 because we're not brought up to ask such questions.
###230 We're brought up [with]: If you get money you can buy anything;
###233 a Rolls-Royce, or a big house with 40 rooms.
###237 Most aims are for money, not scientific instruments.
###242 If you wonder why do people only think of making money?
###245 [It's] because they can buy any car, any house, pay off people.
###249 Money is a symbol and it can get you anything you want.
###253 If you study chemistry, you might learn about chemicals
###257 but you can't afford to live in a nice house.
###261 That's why people are money-oriented.
###264 Not because they're bad or greedy.
###267 [It's] because money gives them what they want
###269 and without it they can't have what they want.
###273 Is that real clear? It's rewarding to people.
###277 If helping people is rewarding you instead of money
###281 that's different, but you'll be abused by it.
###284 You'll have to drive a car that breaks down
###287 because you don't have the money to buy a car that doesn't break down.
###292 A brand new Mercedes will last longer than the average car
###296 but you can't afford that.
###298 If you use magnetic braking, it will last longer
###303 but you can't afford it.
###305 People with money ask "What's the best braking system?
###308 I'll take two. " You know what I mean?
###311 "How do I make my house fireproof? " "You do this. You do that"
###316 and they can afford it.
###318 Without money, you're pissed off by people
###321 sleeping in the street. You're broke.
###323 Everybody says "This guy is a bum!"
###326 I've met, what they call 'bums'
###328 that were so well read, that they didn't want any part of the system.
###333 They lived in poverty. I think I told you about the guy in Haiti
###337 with a shirt made of nothing but patches.
###340 I couldn't tell which was the real shirt
###342 because it was so patched up.
###345 He was well informed in semantics.
###349 The shirt he wore looked like a guy put a hand grenade in it
###353 and blew it up. There were holes all over it
###356 and torn, and he still buttoned it up because that's all he had.
###361 He loved to read, and he was very well informed
###367 in what he read
###369 but he was pissed on by everybody.
###373 I talked to him for hours. He was bright as hell
###377 but he couldn't identify with being part of the world.
###383 So, they were considered bums
###386 and I consider politicians, bums
###390 and people that design bombers, bums
###394 and the people that made the atom bombs, dangerous
###398 because they gave it to people who were not wise enough to use them.
###402 They couldn't take that into account, but they loved the challenge
###407 of solving the problem.
###410 Even the Bible says "Cast ye not pearl before swine."
###415 You know what that means? If you give a pig a pearl
###418 it doesn't say "Gee that's great, thank you!"
###420 If you give an atom bomb to an undeveloped country
###424 they'll blast the hell out of people they disagree with.
###427 They'll poison the Earth. They don't care about that.
###430 They're not wise enough to use it.
###432 That's what "Cast ye not pearl before swine" means to me.
###436 Don't give people atom bombs. Don't give people bombers
###439 unless they learn to live together in peace!
###442 You give them airplanes, spectroscopes and things like that
###448 so they can educate kids in spectral analysis
###453 and magnetometers, and all the things they don't know exist.
###456 They will not make their own conclusions.
###459 They'll say "Let's put a spectrometer on that and try to find out."
###465 They don't even think that way today. They think
###467 "Man will always be greedy, no matter what you do."
###471 You can say that man has always been greedy
###474 due to scarcity or fear of loss.
###477 A man can have a million dollars and still steal
###481 because he wants to secure his position.
###484 He wants to make damn sure that even if the banks fail
###487 he has money buried under the mattress
###489 or under the ground in a trunk in the backyard.
###493 People are insecure because they've known banks to fail
###497 and all their money that they put in the banks is gone
###501 because the bankers called other bankers and said "Hey!
###505 We're going to sell out. We're going to close down in three months.
###508 Take your money out" to their friends in the banking business.
###512 They did that first, so there was nothing left
###516 even though a guy worked all his life and saved up $800,000.
###521 When the bank failed, they were lined up outside the banks
###524 demanding their money. The banks said "We don't have it"
###528 and the people killed themselves because they felt
###531 they'd let their families down.
###533 So people that don't put money in the banks
###536 they have a locker in banks where you can put cash
###541 and it gets no interest
###543 but that can't be touched by the banks. They can't invest it.
###548 In that way came a form of security.
###551 If you put a million dollars in the bank, if you did that
###555 and you get interest, you get about $50,000 a year in interest
###560 so you don't have to worry about anything.
###562 You can live on $50,000 a year as long as your million stays there.
###567 And that puts it on the back of other people.
###571 [Roxanne] - We should... I should go down and... - Yes, OK.
###577 That was the last portion of a talk on the subject of relativity
###580 and he covers some other things in there, as well.
###583 If you'd like to hear more of that
###586 as well as other lectures in audio format
###589 please go to the twitter page that we just set up
###591 where we will post links to more new material including answers
###595 to questions and more current update briefs.
###598 I'll put a link to the twitter below.
###601 In addition to the Venus Project tours
###603 which are given on scheduled Saturdays
###606 Jacque continues to give new lectures almost daily
###609 in which he covers all areas of social designs, human behavior
###613 and more in depth issues that are important to consider and understand
###617 when learning about this direction and way of thinking.
###620 We're also doing our best to get
###623 these talks edited and released onto DVD and expect to have
###627 about 15 to 20 new lectures available as soon as we can.
###631 If you check on thevenusproject. com, you go to the store
###635 check that out. In the next hopefully few weeks
###638 there will be some new material available there.
###640 Thanks for watching, and also The Venus Project
###644 is appreciative of everybody that's out there
###646 in the trenches talking about these ideas that are not so easy
###650 to talk about with 'normal people'.
###655 As Jacque always says "We have a tough job ahead of us
###658 but I'd rather have a tough job than to go along with this system."
