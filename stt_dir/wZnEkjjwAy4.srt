1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,7



2
0:0:0,7 --> 0:0:2,32
FEMALE SPEAKER: Chance to
enjoy some of the tunes


3
0:0:2,32 --> 0:0:4,9
that we set out to set the mood.


4
0:0:4,9 --> 0:0:8,75
From Barrett Strong's,
"Money"-- that's what I want--


5
0:0:8,75 --> 0:0:13,515
to Pink Floyd's, "Money", to
Lady Gaga's, "Money Honey",


6
0:0:13,515 --> 0:0:16,955
it's multiple generations of
music all singing the same


7
0:0:16,955 --> 0:0:17,63
tune.


8
0:0:17,63 --> 0:0:19,76
Money is kind of a big deal.


9
0:0:19,76 --> 0:0:22,46
So that's why I'm so
excited to introduce you


10
0:0:22,46 --> 0:0:24,12
to Alexa Von Tobel.


11
0:0:24,12 --> 0:0:25,595
And let me read a
little bit about her


12
0:0:25,595 --> 0:0:28,61
so that you can get
just as excited as I am.


13
0:0:28,61 --> 0:0:32,596
So Alexa is the CEO and
founder of LearnVest,


14
0:0:32,596 --> 0:0:34,22
and she's a certified
financial planner


15
0:0:34,22 --> 0:0:38,315
who attended Harvard College
and Harvard Business School.


16
0:0:38,315 --> 0:0:40,69
Alexa has been featured as a
financial expert in the Wall


17
0:0:40,69 --> 0:0:44,76
Street Journal, The New York
Times, Fast Company, Forbes,


18
0:0:44,76 --> 0:0:47,47
InStyle, Glamour,
the list goes on.


19
0:0:47,47 --> 0:0:52,51
She has been recognized
in Inc's "30 Under 30".


20
0:0:52,51 --> 0:0:56,8
She's just been a really,
really strong presence


21
0:0:56,8 --> 0:1:0,47
in what's going to be a
great and important road.


22
0:1:0,47 --> 0:1:3,27
So without further
ado, I really want


23
0:1:3,27 --> 0:1:6,334
to have you meet
Alexa Von Tobel.


24
0:1:6,334 --> 0:1:9,118
[APPLAUSE]


25
0:1:9,118 --> 0:1:11,45
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Hi guys.


26
0:1:11,45 --> 0:1:12,9
I'm gonna stand
here if that's OK.


27
0:1:12,9 --> 0:1:13,4
Hi guys.


28
0:1:13,4 --> 0:1:15,509
Thank you so much
for coming out.


29
0:1:15,509 --> 0:1:17,5
It's Thursday, so
I really appreciate


30
0:1:17,5 --> 0:1:19,383
that everyone's coming to
hear a little bit about money.


31
0:1:19,383 --> 0:1:20,69
Come in, sit down.


32
0:1:20,69 --> 0:1:22,65
This is going to be
totally informal,


33
0:1:22,65 --> 0:1:24,19
and here's the goal of today.


34
0:1:24,19 --> 0:1:25,68
When you leave
here in one hour, I


35
0:1:25,68 --> 0:1:27,679
want to make sure that
you've learned everything


36
0:1:27,679 --> 0:1:29,11
that you need to about money.


37
0:1:29,11 --> 0:1:30,3
Ask questions.


38
0:1:30,3 --> 0:1:31,4
Stop me.


39
0:1:31,4 --> 0:1:33,32
I'm in middle of
actually my book tour,


40
0:1:33,32 --> 0:1:35,395
so "Financially
Fearless" is our book.


41
0:1:35,395 --> 0:1:36,77
It's a New York
Times bestseller.


42
0:1:36,77 --> 0:1:39,31
It's actually number one on
Wall Street Journal on business.


43
0:1:39,31 --> 0:1:40,393
So that's pretty exciting.


44
0:1:40,393 --> 0:1:43,66
It came out about now 12
days ago, 15 days ago.


45
0:1:43,66 --> 0:1:47,62
And so we've been going around
the country giving this talk.


46
0:1:47,62 --> 0:1:50,94
I actually gave it to
the Google in New York.


47
0:1:50,94 --> 0:1:51,76
I'm going to the
Google in Beverly Hills


48
0:1:51,76 --> 0:1:55,12
after this and a bunch of other
companies and organizations.


49
0:1:55,12 --> 0:1:56,37
So I've done it a lot.


50
0:1:56,37 --> 0:1:57,328
You're going to have questions.


51
0:1:57,328 --> 0:1:58,35
Ask them.


52
0:1:58,35 --> 0:2:0,36
And I'm going to stay and
sit up here at the end


53
0:2:0,36 --> 0:2:1,67
and actually ask
one on one questions


54
0:2:1,67 --> 0:2:3,419
if you wanna take the
time to do something


55
0:2:3,419 --> 0:2:5,13
that's really specific to you.


56
0:2:5,13 --> 0:2:6,61
So 10 seconds on me.


57
0:2:6,61 --> 0:2:8,68
I grew up in Florida,
I went to Harvard.


58
0:2:8,68 --> 0:2:13,17
Went back to Wall St-- to Morgan
Stanley and worked as a trader


59
0:2:13,17 --> 0:2:14,4
on the prop-desk.


60
0:2:14,4 --> 0:2:16,97
Went back to Harvard Business
School in the fall 2008.


61
0:2:16,97 --> 0:2:18,63
Won a big business
plan competition


62
0:2:18,63 --> 0:2:21,66
and ultimately dropped out.


63
0:2:21,66 --> 0:2:24,67
I think we were in the heart
of the worst recession in 81


64
0:2:24,67 --> 0:2:27,4
years, and I was literally
customer number one.


65
0:2:27,4 --> 0:2:30,47
You guys are really
great product people.


66
0:2:30,47 --> 0:2:32,38
I literally didn't know what
to do with my own finances.


67
0:2:32,38 --> 0:2:34,302
I was young, I didn't
have a ton of money,


68
0:2:34,302 --> 0:2:35,26
I didn't have no money.


69
0:2:35,26 --> 0:2:37,551
I was trying to figure out
like, what's a credit score?


70
0:2:37,551 --> 0:2:39,39
What are the things
that I need to know?


71
0:2:39,39 --> 0:2:41,96
And what I found
was, it was such BS.


72
0:2:41,96 --> 0:2:44,26
Literally trying to
navigate your money.


73
0:2:44,26 --> 0:2:46,654
It's like, you literally
go Google tons of content.


74
0:2:46,654 --> 0:2:49,7
You don't know it's updated,
you don't know if it's wrong.


75
0:2:49,7 --> 0:2:51,486
I actually just had some at
the Google in New York come up


76
0:2:51,486 --> 0:2:52,89
to me and actually was in tears.


77
0:2:52,89 --> 0:2:54,609
And she was like,
Alexa, I really


78
0:2:54,609 --> 0:2:56,15
need and want to
figure out my money.


79
0:2:56,15 --> 0:2:58,3
She was like, I'm not
in a bad position.


80
0:2:58,3 --> 0:3:0,46
She was like, but I spent
over eight hours trying


81
0:3:0,46 --> 0:3:3,829
to find a financial expert,
finally found someone.


82
0:3:3,829 --> 0:3:5,62
Took about a week to
get them on the phone.


83
0:3:5,62 --> 0:3:7,36
We got on the
phone, and they want


84
0:3:7,36 --> 0:3:8,917
to charge me like
a $3,000 retainer,


85
0:3:8,917 --> 0:3:10,5
and then I have to
commit that I wanna


86
0:3:10,5 --> 0:3:11,875
work with them for over a year.


87
0:3:11,875 --> 0:3:14,0
She was like, and I don't
have thousands of dollars


88
0:3:14,0 --> 0:3:15,49
to spend to figure out my money.


89
0:3:15,49 --> 0:3:18,77
And the bottom line is, I was
like, why isn't there a way


90
0:3:18,77 --> 0:3:20,91
to make people feel
great about money?


91
0:3:20,91 --> 0:3:24,185
To make it extremely accessible,
and frankly, affordable.


92
0:3:24,185 --> 0:3:26,31
And I'm going to share some
really important stuff.


93
0:3:26,31 --> 0:3:29,24
But the goal of today is for
you to walk out feeling smarter.


94
0:3:29,24 --> 0:3:32,32
I'm really psyched that
we got you guys books.


95
0:3:32,32 --> 0:3:36,18
And without further
ado, we'll get started.


96
0:3:36,18 --> 0:3:37,9
So first, what is LearnVest?


97
0:3:37,9 --> 0:3:39,451
We've raised $45 million.


98
0:3:39,451 --> 0:3:41,45
We're now one of the
leading and fastest growing


99
0:3:41,45 --> 0:3:43,96
online financial planning
companies in the whole country.


100
0:3:43,96 --> 0:3:45,9
We raise money from
Excel Venture Partners.


101
0:3:45,9 --> 0:3:48,795
We actually just closed a big
round of another $20 million.


102
0:3:48,795 --> 0:3:50,26
We're located in New York City.


103
0:3:50,26 --> 0:3:51,58
We've got 110 employees.


104
0:3:51,58 --> 0:3:56,16
By the end of year we'll
probably have about 180 to 200.


105
0:3:56,16 --> 0:3:59,9
Plainly, simply put, we are
a program for your money.


106
0:3:59,9 --> 0:4:2,23
We literally, and you guys get
product, as I said, so well.


107
0:4:2,23 --> 0:4:3,8
We spent the last
three years, got


108
0:4:3,8 --> 0:4:5,716
some of the best certified
financial planners.


109
0:4:5,716 --> 0:4:7,2
That's the doctor
for your money.


110
0:4:7,2 --> 0:4:9,66
Most people don't
even notice CFP is.


111
0:4:9,66 --> 0:4:11,86
We then took a bunch of
really great product people


112
0:4:11,86 --> 0:4:14,85
and technologists, and we
built really rich software


113
0:4:14,85 --> 0:4:17,57
that can take any household,
whether you make $50,000,


114
0:4:17,57 --> 0:4:20,67
or $500,000, And
quickly find out


115
0:4:20,67 --> 0:4:22,14
what your big weak points are.


116
0:4:22,14 --> 0:4:24,262
Like where you have
sort of red alerts,


117
0:4:24,262 --> 0:4:26,22
and then figuring out
how you can make progress


118
0:4:26,22 --> 0:4:27,43
on your money.


119
0:4:27,43 --> 0:4:29,59
It's a really simple program.


120
0:4:29,59 --> 0:4:32,21
The goal when I set out was that
I want to make it accessible.


121
0:4:32,21 --> 0:4:34,816
It shouldn't be this
like, five day process,


122
0:4:34,816 --> 0:4:36,19
where you don't
know where to go.


123
0:4:36,19 --> 0:4:38,35
You don't know if
it's actual expert.


124
0:4:38,35 --> 0:4:39,83
It's really expensive.


125
0:4:39,83 --> 0:4:42,235
Because the message that
happens there is you then


126
0:4:42,235 --> 0:4:44,18
tell yourself, I
shouldn't be doing this.


127
0:4:44,18 --> 0:4:45,74
It's so complicated.


128
0:4:45,74 --> 0:4:46,64
It's so hard.


129
0:4:46,64 --> 0:4:48,61
Clearly I shouldn't be
taking care of my money.


130
0:4:48,61 --> 0:4:50,57
When in fact, that's
not the point.


131
0:4:50,57 --> 0:4:53,45
And then finally, we wanted to
make it trusted and unbiased.


132
0:4:53,45 --> 0:4:56,3
So our experts at LearnVest
don't sell anything.


133
0:4:56,3 --> 0:4:57,42
They just give you advice.


134
0:4:57,42 --> 0:4:58,92
And my whole
family's in medicine.


135
0:4:58,92 --> 0:5:0,42
And one of the
things that I started


136
0:5:0,42 --> 0:5:2,84
recognizing as I was
building the company,


137
0:5:2,84 --> 0:5:5,22
was you literally could
go to some experts


138
0:5:5,22 --> 0:5:7,5
and they actually get
paid to sell your product.


139
0:5:7,5 --> 0:5:8,82
The problem there, it's
like going to the doctor


140
0:5:8,82 --> 0:5:10,194
and them getting
paid to pump you


141
0:5:10,194 --> 0:5:14,2
full of antibiotics and shots,
when you're actually just sick


142
0:5:14,2 --> 0:5:16,19
and need someone to
take care of you.


143
0:5:16,19 --> 0:5:18,6
Next slide.


144
0:5:18,6 --> 0:5:21,2
So first, follow
me and LearnVest.


145
0:5:21,2 --> 0:5:23,51
We're on the tour
for the next 30 days.


146
0:5:23,51 --> 0:5:25,13
But also, shoot questions to us.


147
0:5:25,13 --> 0:5:26,33
We will answer them.


148
0:5:26,33 --> 0:5:28,8
But we share a ton
of behind the scenes,


149
0:5:28,8 --> 0:5:31,46
a ton of really important
money hacks at all times.


150
0:5:31,46 --> 0:5:32,85
So, this is us.


151
0:5:32,85 --> 0:5:34,18
Next.


152
0:5:34,18 --> 0:5:35,972
And really quickly,
so the book's


153
0:5:35,972 --> 0:5:37,93
call-- I wanted to call
the book, "The F Word",


154
0:5:37,93 --> 0:5:38,23
first of all.


155
0:5:38,23 --> 0:5:39,98
Because none of us
wanna talk about money.


156
0:5:39,98 --> 0:5:40,94
It's this topic.


157
0:5:40,94 --> 0:5:42,14
It's super stressful.


158
0:5:42,14 --> 0:5:43,75
In fact, like for
a century, like


159
0:5:43,75 --> 0:5:45,79
we've taught everyone
never to talk about money.


160
0:5:45,79 --> 0:5:47,49
It's this totally
impolite thing.


161
0:5:47,49 --> 0:5:50,95
But the problem is,
everyone deals with money.


162
0:5:50,95 --> 0:5:54,31
In fact, we make 6 to 10 money
decisions every single day.


163
0:5:54,31 --> 0:5:57,57
And we will every day that
we're alive on this earth.


164
0:5:57,57 --> 0:6:0,4
I actually go so far as to say
that financial planning should


165
0:6:0,4 --> 0:6:2,901
be, literally should
be a civil right.


166
0:6:2,901 --> 0:6:4,65
Just like sort of
getting access to health


167
0:6:4,65 --> 0:6:7,294
care, because if your
money's in complete disarray,


168
0:6:7,294 --> 0:6:8,71
you can't protect
your family, you


169
0:6:8,71 --> 0:6:10,98
can't take care of
yourself, you can't


170
0:6:10,98 --> 0:6:13,5
lead even a normal average life.


171
0:6:13,5 --> 0:6:15,62
And so, I'm actually
going on this tour.


172
0:6:15,62 --> 0:6:17,2
It's kind of crazy.


173
0:6:17,2 --> 0:6:19,61
I was in Denver this morning,
I was in Nashville yesterday,


174
0:6:19,61 --> 0:6:21,84
Chicago the day before,
Indiana the day before that,


175
0:6:21,84 --> 0:6:23,36
and going back to New York.


176
0:6:23,36 --> 0:6:25,11
Shooting everything
from, tomorrow morning


177
0:6:25,11 --> 0:6:27,1
we're on Good Morning America.


178
0:6:27,1 --> 0:6:29,21
We're supposed to be shooting
Piers Morgan tonight,


179
0:6:29,21 --> 0:6:32,57
all the way to next week
Seattle, San Francisco,


180
0:6:32,57 --> 0:6:34,526
Jacksonville, etc.


181
0:6:34,526 --> 0:6:36,15
Running around the
country, doing this.


182
0:6:36,15 --> 0:6:40,0
Going to high schools colleges,
churches, hospitals, companies.


183
0:6:40,0 --> 0:6:41,55
Literally giving
this money talk so


184
0:6:41,55 --> 0:6:43,542
that everyone gets empowered.


185
0:6:43,542 --> 0:6:45,25
We call it "Financially
Fearless America"


186
0:6:45,25 --> 0:6:48,33
because a really important
rule is, I've probably


187
0:6:48,33 --> 0:6:50,2
talked to well
over 10,000 people,


188
0:6:50,2 --> 0:6:53,14
and I've actually never met a
single person that has said,


189
0:6:53,14 --> 0:6:54,82
I feel great about my money.


190
0:6:54,82 --> 0:6:59,291
It is just this topic of stress,
anxiety, eating cu-- none of us


191
0:6:59,291 --> 0:7:0,79
grew up with enough
money, trust me.


192
0:7:0,79 --> 0:7:3,33
Even if you did, you know
someone who grew up with more.


193
0:7:3,33 --> 0:7:7,11
It's really this topic of
pretty deep stress and strain.


194
0:7:7,11 --> 0:7:9,34
You're not saving enough,
you don't make enough.


195
0:7:9,34 --> 0:7:11,64
Because it literally
is this topic


196
0:7:11,64 --> 0:7:13,2
that you always are comparing.


197
0:7:13,2 --> 0:7:17,27
And the problem with that is, we
know mathematically, about 85%


198
0:7:17,27 --> 0:7:19,87
of the audience
is too embarrassed


199
0:7:19,87 --> 0:7:22,89
and too stressed out to actually
go and jump and make progress.


200
0:7:22,89 --> 0:7:26,5
And about 15% sort of
feels maybe ish confident.


201
0:7:26,5 --> 0:7:28,49
They're like, I think I'm
doing it, I think I'm doing it.


202
0:7:28,49 --> 0:7:30,8
And what we find is
both a really bad,


203
0:7:30,8 --> 0:7:33,25
because you end up not actually
making progress on your money.


204
0:7:33,25 --> 0:7:34,71
Next.


205
0:7:34,71 --> 0:7:36,94
So some really important stats.


206
0:7:36,94 --> 0:7:40,51
Right now, 76% of the country,
and I gave a TED talk on this,


207
0:7:40,51 --> 0:7:43,58
feels out of control when
it comes to their money.


208
0:7:43,58 --> 0:7:46,562
And we describe
exactly what we found.


209
0:7:46,562 --> 0:7:48,77
It is like being in a boat
in the middle of the ocean


210
0:7:48,77 --> 0:7:51,5
and you literally just don't
know which way is land.


211
0:7:51,5 --> 0:7:54,1
That may sound dramatic, but
it's actually pretty accurate.


212
0:7:54,1 --> 0:7:56,566
And the reason, what we
find, is the average person


213
0:7:56,566 --> 0:7:57,94
can spare a lit--
and by the way,


214
0:7:57,94 --> 0:8:0,51
this is obviously not
above the average audience,


215
0:8:0,51 --> 0:8:2,9
and you'll see some stats
about the more money you make,


216
0:8:2,9 --> 0:8:5,66
how things actually can
get more complicated.


217
0:8:5,66 --> 0:8:8,524
But the takeaway here is, you're
in the middle of the ocean.


218
0:8:8,524 --> 0:8:11,19
And let's just say you can spare
a few thousand dollars a month.


219
0:8:11,19 --> 0:8:12,82
Which, let's just
say that that's


220
0:8:12,82 --> 0:8:14,36
what this room can spare.


221
0:8:14,36 --> 0:8:16,17
You then have so
many priorities,


222
0:8:16,17 --> 0:8:18,792
that you're not quite sure
which bucket to fill first.


223
0:8:18,792 --> 0:8:20,0
Do you pay down student debt?


224
0:8:20,0 --> 0:8:21,374
Do you pay down
credit card debt?


225
0:8:21,374 --> 0:8:23,0
Do you contribute to your 401K?


226
0:8:23,0 --> 0:8:24,69
There's a matching program here.


227
0:8:24,69 --> 0:8:27,4
Do you think about 529
plans for your kids?


228
0:8:27,4 --> 0:8:28,85
Do you help your
aging parent, which,


229
0:8:28,85 --> 0:8:31,69
that is a really big new
topic that our generation will


230
0:8:31,69 --> 0:8:32,98
be faced with.


231
0:8:32,98 --> 0:8:34,5
Do you have emergency savings?


232
0:8:34,5 --> 0:8:36,2
Do you contribute
to your mortgage?


233
0:8:36,2 --> 0:8:38,78
I mean, you quickly can see,
that you end up being like,


234
0:8:38,78 --> 0:8:40,9
where does my next dollar go?


235
0:8:40,9 --> 0:8:42,13
Like, how do I prioritize?


236
0:8:42,13 --> 0:8:45,12
And the takeaway is, most
people feel pretty stressed out.


237
0:8:45,12 --> 0:8:47,2
Next.


238
0:8:47,2 --> 0:8:49,57
So right now, 61%
of the country,


239
0:8:49,57 --> 0:8:51,4
so just think about
the whole country,


240
0:8:51,4 --> 0:8:53,45
literally lives
paycheck to paycheck.


241
0:8:53,45 --> 0:8:56,6
Which means that they
are not in the position,


242
0:8:56,6 --> 0:8:58,36
if anything happened, to be
able to go grab some cash


243
0:8:58,36 --> 0:8:59,28
and do something.


244
0:8:59,28 --> 0:9:1,21
Most people have
less than one month


245
0:9:1,21 --> 0:9:4,137
of savings of what
their life costs them.


246
0:9:4,137 --> 0:9:6,47
And what's really interesting,
especially for this room,


247
0:9:6,47 --> 0:9:9,85
is 30% of people who
make over $100,000,


248
0:9:9,85 --> 0:9:11,35
live paycheck to paycheck.


249
0:9:11,35 --> 0:9:13,971
So I say that because
we sort of intuitively


250
0:9:13,971 --> 0:9:16,22
think having more money means
that you have less money


251
0:9:16,22 --> 0:9:17,25
problems.


252
0:9:17,25 --> 0:9:18,83
But we all know
exactly what happens.


253
0:9:18,83 --> 0:9:20,25
You get the slightly
bigger home,


254
0:9:20,25 --> 0:9:21,92
with the nice
marble counter tops.


255
0:9:21,92 --> 0:9:23,36
And you drive the nicer car.


256
0:9:23,36 --> 0:9:25,374
And you go on the
slightly nicer vacations.


257
0:9:25,374 --> 0:9:26,79
So simply having
more doesn't mean


258
0:9:26,79 --> 0:9:28,22
that you have any less problems.


259
0:9:28,22 --> 0:9:29,71
And I make that
point, because when


260
0:9:29,71 --> 0:9:31,376
you think about your
own money, and when


261
0:9:31,376 --> 0:9:32,85
you think about
sort of the we all


262
0:9:32,85 --> 0:9:35,38
do the comparison situation.


263
0:9:35,38 --> 0:9:37,68
Simply because someone
makes more money does not


264
0:9:37,68 --> 0:9:40,596
mean that behind the scenes,
they're in a better situation.


265
0:9:40,596 --> 0:9:42,47
And I can tell you,
we've seen the bus driver


266
0:9:42,47 --> 0:9:46,71
who makes $60,000, who owns
two homes, and has no debt.


267
0:9:46,71 --> 0:9:48,75
And we've seen the
Wall Street guy or gal


268
0:9:48,75 --> 0:9:52,17
who makes $250,000 who has
$20,000 of credit card debt,


269
0:9:52,17 --> 0:9:53,61
doesn't own anything.


270
0:9:53,61 --> 0:9:56,6
And the takeaway there
is, what you make,


271
0:9:56,6 --> 0:10:0,41
and what you do with it are
very, very different things.


272
0:10:0,41 --> 0:10:1,63
Next.


273
0:10:1,63 --> 0:10:4,26
So, I always go
through these excuses


274
0:10:4,26 --> 0:10:7,75
and I say it just because I
have literally-- LearnVest


275
0:10:7,75 --> 0:10:8,75
is massive.


276
0:10:8,75 --> 0:10:11,23
We have hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of users.


277
0:10:11,23 --> 0:10:13,71
Adding anywhere from
about 1000 to 5000 a day.


278
0:10:13,71 --> 0:10:17,51
People write in all the time,
and I read probably at least 50


279
0:10:17,51 --> 0:10:19,75
to 100 emails every day.


280
0:10:19,75 --> 0:10:22,14
And I can't tell you
the number of people


281
0:10:22,14 --> 0:10:23,536
who-- we hear the excuses.


282
0:10:23,536 --> 0:10:25,66
And it's things like, but
I don't have enough money


283
0:10:25,66 --> 0:10:26,96
to care about my money.


284
0:10:26,96 --> 0:10:29,75
And actually, mathematically,
when you have less money,


285
0:10:29,75 --> 0:10:32,182
it is actually more
critical for you


286
0:10:32,182 --> 0:10:34,0
to know where your
next dollar should go.


287
0:10:34,0 --> 0:10:36,73
Which, my whole TED talk was
about how financial planning


288
0:10:36,73 --> 0:10:38,415
should not be a luxury product.


289
0:10:38,415 --> 0:10:40,54
Right now, if you have well
over a million dollars,


290
0:10:40,54 --> 0:10:44,7
there's a slew of places you
can go to get investment advice.


291
0:10:44,7 --> 0:10:46,87
But if you have less,
which 98.6% of the country


292
0:10:46,87 --> 0:10:49,247
has less than a million
dollars, there's


293
0:10:49,247 --> 0:10:50,58
not a lot of great places to go.


294
0:10:50,58 --> 0:10:53,98
In fact, I would argue that
there was not a great place


295
0:10:53,98 --> 0:10:55,87
to go, before LearnVest.


296
0:10:55,87 --> 0:10:58,302
So first, I don't
have enough money.


297
0:10:58,302 --> 0:10:59,52
I'm ashamed.


298
0:10:59,52 --> 0:11:1,28
I don't want to get started.


299
0:11:1,28 --> 0:11:4,24
Last night, I was in Denver,
and a woman who was in her


300
0:11:4,24 --> 0:11:7,34
'60s came up to me and was like,
I cannot tell you what I would


301
0:11:7,34 --> 0:11:9,39
have given for someone to
tell me this when I was


302
0:11:9,39 --> 0:11:10,86
in my '20s, '30s.


303
0:11:10,86 --> 0:11:13,43
Maybe even '40s, because it
could have changed so much.


304
0:11:13,43 --> 0:11:16,11
She was just like here I
am, and I can't do a lot.


305
0:11:16,11 --> 0:11:18,61
So we always say like, the
problem's not going to go away,


306
0:11:18,61 --> 0:11:19,74
you just have to solve it.


307
0:11:19,74 --> 0:11:21,73
And it's about
making that barrier


308
0:11:21,73 --> 0:11:23,67
to solving it pretty low.


309
0:11:23,67 --> 0:11:26,19
We get a lot of, I don't even
know what a financial plan is.


310
0:11:26,19 --> 0:11:27,32
Well, that's what I'm
going to walk through.


311
0:11:27,32 --> 0:11:28,54
That's what the
book walks through.


312
0:11:28,54 --> 0:11:30,748
And I'm gonna share some of
my favorite hacks for you


313
0:11:30,748 --> 0:11:33,75
guys today that are
absolutely worth your time.


314
0:11:33,75 --> 0:11:36,276
And then finally, we
see a lot-- again,


315
0:11:36,276 --> 0:11:37,9
a small portion of
people say I kind of


316
0:11:37,9 --> 0:11:39,869
think I handle on things.


317
0:11:39,869 --> 0:11:41,66
And then we actually
look at their finances


318
0:11:41,66 --> 0:11:43,45
and see that they're
no better off,


319
0:11:43,45 --> 0:11:45,4
but they just sort of
think that they are.


320
0:11:45,4 --> 0:11:48,34
And so the takeaway is,
put those excuses aside.


321
0:11:48,34 --> 0:11:48,7
You already did.


322
0:11:48,7 --> 0:11:49,56
You came to this talk.


323
0:11:49,56 --> 0:11:51,41
But I like to say them out
loud, because they sort of run


324
0:11:51,41 --> 0:11:52,64
through all of our heads.


325
0:11:52,64 --> 0:11:53,76
Next.


326
0:11:53,76 --> 0:11:55,9
So, this is LearnVest.


327
0:11:55,9 --> 0:11:58,72
We literally as I just
said, raised $45 million


328
0:11:58,72 --> 0:12:0,92
with the whole
goal of disrupting


329
0:12:0,92 --> 0:12:2,81
the financial planning space.


330
0:12:2,81 --> 0:12:5,87
Let me talk about what
that means for a second.


331
0:12:5,87 --> 0:12:8,43
Right now, like that whole
offline, go see a planner,


332
0:12:8,43 --> 0:12:10,72
print out your documents,
bring them to them.


333
0:12:10,72 --> 0:12:11,601
It is so anticrated.


334
0:12:11,601 --> 0:12:13,35
When you think about
the incredible things


335
0:12:13,35 --> 0:12:16,38
that a company like Google has
done, or Apple's Genius Bar,


336
0:12:16,38 --> 0:12:21,2
or even Weight Watchers, a
program for your weight loss.


337
0:12:21,2 --> 0:12:24,649
For me, the financial
space is so old school.


338
0:12:24,649 --> 0:12:26,69
Literally, banks are open
from like 9:00 to 5:00.


339
0:12:26,69 --> 0:12:29,63
Actually the bank near me
closes on Saturdays its open


340
0:12:29,63 --> 0:12:30,78
from 11:00 to 2:00.


341
0:12:30,78 --> 0:12:31,64
I'm like wait, what?


342
0:12:31,64 --> 0:12:33,8
It's Saturday.


343
0:12:33,8 --> 0:12:36,26
But it is this last space
that hasn't been completely


344
0:12:36,26 --> 0:12:38,56
disrupted by incredible
technologies.


345
0:12:38,56 --> 0:12:40,54
And so all we did
was pretty simple.


346
0:12:40,54 --> 0:12:44,286
We built an incredible basic
way to filter any household


347
0:12:44,286 --> 0:12:45,91
to make sure that
they know what to do.


348
0:12:45,91 --> 0:12:48,53
And then we connect you
to an expert on our staff.


349
0:12:48,53 --> 0:12:50,2
And then we got
rid of all the BS.


350
0:12:50,2 --> 0:12:50,982
All the friction.


351
0:12:50,982 --> 0:12:52,44
I don't know where
to find someone.


352
0:12:52,44 --> 0:12:53,547
It's way too expensive.


353
0:12:53,547 --> 0:12:55,38
I don't know how to get
them my information.


354
0:12:55,38 --> 0:12:58,31
So the tips that came out,
that are in this book,


355
0:12:58,31 --> 0:13:1,7
are from four years of being
a certified financial planner


356
0:13:1,7 --> 0:13:2,11
myself.


357
0:13:2,11 --> 0:13:5,32
From talking to literally
thousands of customers.


358
0:13:5,32 --> 0:13:7,0
From tremendous
amounts of research.


359
0:13:7,0 --> 0:13:8,32
And I'm going to tell
you guys the one,


360
0:13:8,32 --> 0:13:9,55
because at the end
of the day, I'm


361
0:13:9,55 --> 0:13:10,98
not that different than
you guys, in the sense


362
0:13:10,98 --> 0:13:12,24
that none of us have extra time.


363
0:13:12,24 --> 0:13:14,24
We're all-- you know, you have
your job, you have your family,


364
0:13:14,24 --> 0:13:15,47
you have your kids,
you have your health,


365
0:13:15,47 --> 0:13:16,88
you're juggling so much.


366
0:13:16,88 --> 0:13:18,71
So one of the big
things at LearnVest,


367
0:13:18,71 --> 0:13:21,25
we only share things that
are worth your energy.


368
0:13:21,25 --> 0:13:24,16
Things are going to make a real
impact on your financial life.


369
0:13:24,16 --> 0:13:25,302
Next.


370
0:13:25,302 --> 0:13:27,76
So we developed this thing,
it's called the Action Program.


371
0:13:27,76 --> 0:13:29,35
It's literally a
seven step process.


372
0:13:29,35 --> 0:13:30,75
And it can take any one.


373
0:13:30,75 --> 0:13:31,716
Any household.


374
0:13:31,716 --> 0:13:33,9
One thing you guys
should know is


375
0:13:33,9 --> 0:13:35,89
our users are between 25 and 65.


376
0:13:35,89 --> 0:13:38,43
Our core users are really
in their '30s and '40s,


377
0:13:38,43 --> 0:13:39,804
and they're often households.


378
0:13:39,804 --> 0:13:41,47
You know, if you're
single, it's single.


379
0:13:41,47 --> 0:13:43,132
But if you're
married, it's both.


380
0:13:43,132 --> 0:13:44,59
And we put you
through this filter.


381
0:13:44,59 --> 0:13:46,1
What I'm going to
do today is walk you


382
0:13:46,1 --> 0:13:47,13
all through the filter.


383
0:13:47,13 --> 0:13:48,68
So think about
your own situation.


384
0:13:48,68 --> 0:13:50,43
Think about the tips
that really resonate.


385
0:13:50,43 --> 0:13:51,48
Write down questions.


386
0:13:51,48 --> 0:13:53,58
And again, I'll answer
some broad ones at the end.


387
0:13:53,58 --> 0:13:56,38
And then I can sit up here and
answer one on one questions.


388
0:13:56,38 --> 0:13:58,68
So, the first step is organize.


389
0:13:58,68 --> 0:14:1,357
I cannot tell you guys
the number of people,


390
0:14:1,357 --> 0:14:2,69
really well educated by the way.


391
0:14:2,69 --> 0:14:4,41
So I don't care if you went
to Harvard Business School


392
0:14:4,41 --> 0:14:7,28
and work at Goldman Sachs,
you went to community college,


393
0:14:7,28 --> 0:14:9,3
we don't learn about
this in school.


394
0:14:9,3 --> 0:14:11,21
I had two great educations.


395
0:14:11,21 --> 0:14:12,24
Doesn't matter.


396
0:14:12,24 --> 0:14:13,75
We don't learn about it in
high schools or colleges


397
0:14:13,75 --> 0:14:14,541
across the country.


398
0:14:14,541 --> 0:14:17,8
I was actually just
at the White House


399
0:14:17,8 --> 0:14:19,786
last Thursday with
Congresswomen trying


400
0:14:19,786 --> 0:14:21,16
to figure out how
we can actually


401
0:14:21,16 --> 0:14:24,3
start changing some of
the rules around that.


402
0:14:24,3 --> 0:14:26,72
But the takeaway is,
regardless of your education,


403
0:14:26,72 --> 0:14:30,31
regardless of what you make, we
see disorganization everywhere.


404
0:14:30,31 --> 0:14:31,91
And here's what I mean by that.


405
0:14:31,91 --> 0:14:34,9
First of all, ideally, all
your accounts are online.


406
0:14:34,9 --> 0:14:37,76
I mean, even my husband who
went to Harvard with me,


407
0:14:37,76 --> 0:14:39,37
he still had that
like one account


408
0:14:39,37 --> 0:14:41,54
that doesn't have
anything online.


409
0:14:41,54 --> 0:14:43,7
And I was like,
what are you doing?


410
0:14:43,7 --> 0:14:44,59
We've gotta like,
be able to see that.


411
0:14:44,59 --> 0:14:45,54
You've got to be able to log in.


412
0:14:45,54 --> 0:14:47,132
You can't wait for
paper statements.


413
0:14:47,132 --> 0:14:49,34
Or to have a bank it's
literally in a different state


414
0:14:49,34 --> 0:14:51,107
that you actually
can't go and see.


415
0:14:51,107 --> 0:14:52,69
So one of the things
that we recommend


416
0:14:52,69 --> 0:14:55,6
are, and again, we don't
work with any banks directly.


417
0:14:55,6 --> 0:14:58,249
We don't promote any accounts.


418
0:14:58,249 --> 0:15:0,54
Everything that you do you
should be able to be online.


419
0:15:0,54 --> 0:15:1,51
And I'll give you a quick sense.


420
0:15:1,51 --> 0:15:3,43
So, people come in all
the time and we end up


421
0:15:3,43 --> 0:15:5,426
realizing that they
have like 14 accounts.


422
0:15:5,426 --> 0:15:7,3
When you have a household,
and you have kids,


423
0:15:7,3 --> 0:15:9,51
it quickly can turn
into 20 accounts.


424
0:15:9,51 --> 0:15:11,54
And so we just say,
fewer is better.


425
0:15:11,54 --> 0:15:12,42
Plain and simple.


426
0:15:12,42 --> 0:15:15,99
You know, you're FDI insured
up to a huge amount of money.


427
0:15:15,99 --> 0:15:18,53
And so first, link them to
the LearnVest Money Center.


428
0:15:18,53 --> 0:15:20,0
It's our free tool.


429
0:15:20,0 --> 0:15:22,63
Great, great five
star ratings etc.


430
0:15:22,63 --> 0:15:24,54
If you go to the next slide.


431
0:15:24,54 --> 0:15:26,5
Let me give you some
really specific things.


432
0:15:26,5 --> 0:15:30,59
So first, my accounts, I
actually have personally,


433
0:15:30,59 --> 0:15:31,38
two credit cards.


434
0:15:31,38 --> 0:15:32,98
Now with my husband
I have a third.


435
0:15:32,98 --> 0:15:34,81
I have my Bank of
America account,


436
0:15:34,81 --> 0:15:37,2
because I have ATMs
within three blocks of me


437
0:15:37,2 --> 0:15:40,24
in both places, my
job, and my home.


438
0:15:40,24 --> 0:15:44,5
I have all my money over at
Fidelity, and my 401K is there.


439
0:15:44,5 --> 0:15:45,24
That's it.


440
0:15:45,24 --> 0:15:45,7
That's what we got.


441
0:15:45,7 --> 0:15:46,991
That's what we're working with.


442
0:15:46,991 --> 0:15:48,24
And it's really--


443
0:15:48,24 --> 0:15:48,94
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


444
0:15:48,94 --> 0:15:50,39
ALEXA VON TOBEL: FDIC?


445
0:15:50,39 --> 0:15:52,702
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
split their money


446
0:15:52,702 --> 0:15:54,66
between different accounts
so that none of them


447
0:15:54,66 --> 0:15:55,67
was above the limit.


448
0:15:55,67 --> 0:15:58,53
ALEXA VON TOBEL: If you have,
if you're with a partner,


449
0:15:58,53 --> 0:16:1,84
you have up to $2 million
of FDIC insurance.


450
0:16:1,84 --> 0:16:4,55
And it's across four
types of accounts.


451
0:16:4,55 --> 0:16:8,7
So, I'm not in a position where
I have more than $2 million


452
0:16:8,7 --> 0:16:10,86
of cash, so you're
ultimately protected.


453
0:16:10,86 --> 0:16:15,2
And then if it's in a brokerage
account, it SPIC insurance,


454
0:16:15,2 --> 0:16:16,12
and that's even more.


455
0:16:16,12 --> 0:16:19,39
So the takeaway there is, if
you are in a household that


456
0:16:19,39 --> 0:16:21,32
has less than that,
it makes sense


457
0:16:21,32 --> 0:16:23,77
to be able to put
your money there.


458
0:16:23,77 --> 0:16:25,759
For us, why I just
showed you how


459
0:16:25,759 --> 0:16:28,5
we have our accounts set up,
is because everything then


460
0:16:28,5 --> 0:16:29,26
goes into one email address.


461
0:16:29,26 --> 0:16:31,36
It's basically
Alexasbills@gmail.


462
0:16:31,36 --> 0:16:34,142
I get all of our
statements in one place.


463
0:16:34,142 --> 0:16:35,85
If you looked in my
like Gmail right now,


464
0:16:35,85 --> 0:16:38,229
I have 23,000 unread
emails, because you


465
0:16:38,229 --> 0:16:39,77
know, all of the
alerts that you get.


466
0:16:39,77 --> 0:16:41,62
I get my news alerts
from everything.


467
0:16:41,62 --> 0:16:43,91
And what would find is,
bills, statements, alerts,


468
0:16:43,91 --> 0:16:46,3
things I should probably
be seeing would get lost.


469
0:16:46,3 --> 0:16:49,2
So what we say is, with your
household, link everything


470
0:16:49,2 --> 0:16:52,4
up to a new, fresh,
clean account.


471
0:16:52,4 --> 0:16:54,34
Next with that, then
I run my finances


472
0:16:54,34 --> 0:16:55,46
like I run my social life.


473
0:16:55,46 --> 0:16:57,38
I have my Google
Calendar set up.


474
0:16:57,38 --> 0:16:59,316
And I have some really
specific alerts.


475
0:16:59,316 --> 0:17:0,94
They're outlined in
detail in the book.


476
0:17:0,94 --> 0:17:3,51
But the following: in
January, I contribute


477
0:17:3,51 --> 0:17:6,194
to my IRA, and my 401K.


478
0:17:6,194 --> 0:17:8,69
You guys have matching,
so that's free money.


479
0:17:8,69 --> 0:17:10,45
You should take advantage
of every dollar that.


480
0:17:10,45 --> 0:17:14,49
If you can go above the $17,500
that you can put into a 401K


481
0:17:14,49 --> 0:17:17,818
at work, then you want
to contribute to an IRA.


482
0:17:17,818 --> 0:17:20,109
We recommend that contribute
to an IRA at the beginning


483
0:17:20,109 --> 0:17:23,24
of January because you get
a full extra year of tax


484
0:17:23,24 --> 0:17:24,319
free earnings.


485
0:17:24,319 --> 0:17:26,869
And the takeaway there
is, either sit down


486
0:17:26,869 --> 0:17:29,57
and put in the
$5,500 that you can,


487
0:17:29,57 --> 0:17:32,29
or set it so that it's
going to automatically do it


488
0:17:32,29 --> 0:17:33,94
across the year.


489
0:17:33,94 --> 0:17:36,24
That's an alert on my
calendar in January.


490
0:17:36,24 --> 0:17:38,77
In January, I also go
to all my doctor visits.


491
0:17:38,77 --> 0:17:40,39
I do them all in one month.


492
0:17:40,39 --> 0:17:42,82
And I'll share with you in
more detail a few reasons why.


493
0:17:42,82 --> 0:17:44,46
But your health is
your biggest asset.


494
0:17:44,46 --> 0:17:46,376
And actually, you have
great health insurance,


495
0:17:46,376 --> 0:17:48,12
take advantage of it.


496
0:17:48,12 --> 0:17:50,51
In January I also sit
down with my husband.


497
0:17:50,51 --> 0:17:53,17
And if you have a family,
what are we trying to do?


498
0:17:53,17 --> 0:17:54,35
What are our goals for the year?


499
0:17:54,35 --> 0:17:55,94
What are we trying to save for?


500
0:17:55,94 --> 0:17:57,83
And really sit down
and map it out.


501
0:17:57,83 --> 0:17:59,37
Where do we want
to be in one year?


502
0:17:59,37 --> 0:18:0,3
Three years?


503
0:18:0,3 --> 0:18:1,65
Then break it down into months.


504
0:18:1,65 --> 0:18:4,22
You can really get a sense
of what you should be saving.


505
0:18:4,22 --> 0:18:5,844
These are the beginning
pillars of what


506
0:18:5,844 --> 0:18:8,26
a financial plan looks like.


507
0:18:8,26 --> 0:18:10,4
I also, every three months,
check my credit score.


508
0:18:10,4 --> 0:18:12,89
And every year I check
my annual credit report.


509
0:18:12,89 --> 0:18:15,28
Just again, they're
on annual renews.


510
0:18:15,28 --> 0:18:16,0
They just alert.


511
0:18:16,0 --> 0:18:16,9
I get them on my phone.


512
0:18:16,9 --> 0:18:18,66
It's pretty straightforward.


513
0:18:18,66 --> 0:18:19,28
I can't forget.


514
0:18:19,28 --> 0:18:20,78
But those are the
things that we do.


515
0:18:20,78 --> 0:18:23,16
You then have alerts for when
your credit cards are due.


516
0:18:23,16 --> 0:18:25,374
And I'll go into a
lot more detail what


517
0:18:25,374 --> 0:18:28,4
goes into your credit score, but
the takeaway is, missing a bill


518
0:18:28,4 --> 0:18:30,52
is literally one of the
simplest things that


519
0:18:30,52 --> 0:18:32,9
can hurt your credit
score so badly,


520
0:18:32,9 --> 0:18:33,744
and it's just not worth it.


521
0:18:33,744 --> 0:18:35,66
And particularly the
bills that really mess up


522
0:18:35,66 --> 0:18:37,59
are doctors visits.


523
0:18:37,59 --> 0:18:39,17
Because they're
mom and pop shops.


524
0:18:39,17 --> 0:18:41,8
They tend not to have
great online systems.


525
0:18:41,8 --> 0:18:41,58
Right?


526
0:18:41,58 --> 0:18:44,0
You go to your dermatologist,
they send you a paper bill.


527
0:18:44,0 --> 0:18:46,32
We as young people
in this generation,


528
0:18:46,32 --> 0:18:47,53
we move all the time.


529
0:18:47,53 --> 0:18:49,87
So if you don't do mail
forwarding, you miss a bill,


530
0:18:49,87 --> 0:18:51,0
it's $86.


531
0:18:51,0 --> 0:18:52,626
They turn you over
the credit agencies.


532
0:18:52,626 --> 0:18:54,0
Those are the sort
of things that


533
0:18:54,0 --> 0:18:56,48
happen that really affect
people's credit scores that


534
0:18:56,48 --> 0:18:57,51
are simple.


535
0:18:57,51 --> 0:19:0,34
So what we say is, make sure
you have a uniform system


536
0:19:0,34 --> 0:19:2,71
to track everything
all in one place.


537
0:19:2,71 --> 0:19:4,45
Next, as I said, set
up an email address


538
0:19:4,45 --> 0:19:6,9
where everything comes in.


539
0:19:6,9 --> 0:19:8,42
The average person
doesn't check their bills.


540
0:19:8,42 --> 0:19:10,4
Why we say-- there's
Mint and then there's


541
0:19:10,4 --> 0:19:13,159
LearnVest, and both of
us, you can see everything


542
0:19:13,159 --> 0:19:13,7
in one place.


543
0:19:13,7 --> 0:19:14,575
We have no ads in it.


544
0:19:14,575 --> 0:19:16,92
It's literally just your data.


545
0:19:16,92 --> 0:19:20,89
And one of the things that
I do pretty much every day,


546
0:19:20,89 --> 0:19:23,325
at least every few days, is
login, take a money minute,


547
0:19:23,325 --> 0:19:24,93
and just check what's going on.


548
0:19:24,93 --> 0:19:28,17
The reason I do that is, pretty
much every three months I


549
0:19:28,17 --> 0:19:28,97
find an issue.


550
0:19:28,97 --> 0:19:30,91
And I'll explain
what that means.


551
0:19:30,91 --> 0:19:33,3
Let's say I ate at a
restaurant for $100.


552
0:19:33,3 --> 0:19:35,77
I tip 20%, it was $120.


553
0:19:35,77 --> 0:19:38,61
I will find, if I log
in, sometimes people


554
0:19:38,61 --> 0:19:39,49
change your tips.


555
0:19:39,49 --> 0:19:40,301
It happened.


556
0:19:40,301 --> 0:19:42,3
I'd be like it was--
you're nodding, it happens.


557
0:19:42,3 --> 0:19:43,28
It's crazy.


558
0:19:43,28 --> 0:19:46,2
But I was like, wait,
I didn't tip $40.


559
0:19:46,2 --> 0:19:48,26
And one of the things
is if you don't actually


560
0:19:48,26 --> 0:19:50,547
have everything that's
online, accessible.


561
0:19:50,547 --> 0:19:52,13
Linked through a
place like LearnVest,


562
0:19:52,13 --> 0:19:53,77
where you can see everything
in one place, where


563
0:19:53,77 --> 0:19:54,98
you can log in--
you know, if I go,


564
0:19:54,98 --> 0:19:57,44
I can't tell you what I eat
for dinner seven nights ago.


565
0:19:57,44 --> 0:19:59,357
So if I go look
at a bill, I don't


566
0:19:59,357 --> 0:20:1,69
know if it's exactly right,
but I take the time to do it


567
0:20:1,69 --> 0:20:4,36
and then I use credit cards
where I can dispute things.


568
0:20:4,36 --> 0:20:6,399
So one, I think it's
really important


569
0:20:6,399 --> 0:20:7,44
that everything's online.


570
0:20:7,44 --> 0:20:9,32
I think it's really important
all linked to one place.


571
0:20:9,32 --> 0:20:10,736
And I think it's
really important,


572
0:20:10,736 --> 0:20:13,18
one of the things we learned
is, well over more than half


573
0:20:13,18 --> 0:20:15,44
the country doesn't
even open their bills.


574
0:20:15,44 --> 0:20:19,18
And game here plan number
one is open your bills.


575
0:20:19,18 --> 0:20:20,8
Have them come into
an email address.


576
0:20:20,8 --> 0:20:22,63
And then finally,
I log in once a day


577
0:20:22,63 --> 0:20:24,26
so I can actually
see what's going on.


578
0:20:24,26 --> 0:20:26,63
Next.


579
0:20:26,63 --> 0:20:27,82
Step two is focus.


580
0:20:27,82 --> 0:20:30,2
So this is a really
important step.


581
0:20:30,2 --> 0:20:32,66
And again, we built
this entire system


582
0:20:32,66 --> 0:20:34,35
to put a household
through it, and it's


583
0:20:34,35 --> 0:20:36,12
very thoughtfully
in a certain order.


584
0:20:36,12 --> 0:20:37,2
So first, we've gotta
get you organized,


585
0:20:37,2 --> 0:20:38,699
we gotta know what
your numbers are,


586
0:20:38,699 --> 0:20:40,41
we gotta see exactly
what's happening.


587
0:20:40,41 --> 0:20:42,9
From there, we
have to figure out


588
0:20:42,9 --> 0:20:45,69
what comes in every year or
every month, and what goes out.


589
0:20:45,69 --> 0:20:46,714
And let me explain.


590
0:20:46,714 --> 0:20:48,38
So I can't tell you
the number of people


591
0:20:48,38 --> 0:20:50,48
that are like, I make $100,000.


592
0:20:50,48 --> 0:20:51,69
And I'll be like, you don't.


593
0:20:51,69 --> 0:20:53,9
You make $68,000.


594
0:20:53,9 --> 0:20:56,466
Because you have to think of
your life in after tax dollars.


595
0:20:56,466 --> 0:20:58,9
And the reason why
we say that is, one,


596
0:20:58,9 --> 0:21:1,6
it's really easy to over inflate
what your household income is.


597
0:21:1,6 --> 0:21:5,28
Like, you make $100,000, I make
$200,000, we make $300,000.


598
0:21:5,28 --> 0:21:8,7
But you have to think
about an after tax dollars.


599
0:21:8,7 --> 0:21:10,12
So first, look at
your paychecks.


600
0:21:10,12 --> 0:21:12,74
Quickly figure out,
multiply it by 26 or 27,


601
0:21:12,74 --> 0:21:14,922
based on the number
paychecks you get.


602
0:21:14,922 --> 0:21:15,88
That's the first thing.


603
0:21:15,88 --> 0:21:17,37
What really comes in?


604
0:21:17,37 --> 0:21:19,14
And for freelancers,
for people who


605
0:21:19,14 --> 0:21:21,8
have extra money on the side,
it gets more complicated.


606
0:21:21,8 --> 0:21:23,14
Then, what goes out.


607
0:21:23,14 --> 0:21:26,29
So, plain and simple, you have
your obvious fixed expenses.


608
0:21:26,29 --> 0:21:30,4
Your rent, those sort of things,
that are clear, you know them,


609
0:21:30,4 --> 0:21:31,31
they're very regular.


610
0:21:31,31 --> 0:21:33,31
But on the other stuff,
the restaurant and bars,


611
0:21:33,31 --> 0:21:36,18
the travel, the shopping; that's
the stuff that people never


612
0:21:36,18 --> 0:21:37,7
really have a good grasp on.


613
0:21:37,7 --> 0:21:40,18
And so one of the
things is one, do


614
0:21:40,18 --> 0:21:43,3
you know that there's actually
money at the end of the month?


615
0:21:43,3 --> 0:21:46,36
So, if you're not tracking it,
and again, 61% of the country


616
0:21:46,36 --> 0:21:47,842
is living paycheck to paycheck.


617
0:21:47,842 --> 0:21:50,3
Which basically means they're
spending more than they make.


618
0:21:50,3 --> 0:21:54,6
And so, again, good people with
good incomes, that happens.


619
0:21:54,6 --> 0:21:56,965
So what we look at is what
comes in, what's going out,


620
0:21:56,965 --> 0:21:58,34
and we help you
get a real sense.


621
0:21:58,34 --> 0:22:0,84
And you know, LearnVest has
great trends and analysis.


622
0:22:0,84 --> 0:22:3,41
And at the end, we
find out what is left.


623
0:22:3,41 --> 0:22:5,91
We then go through this is
really good negotiation process


624
0:22:5,91 --> 0:22:9,86
with you where, let's just say,
your household makes $7,000


625
0:22:9,86 --> 0:22:12,41
a month and at the end,
there's only $1,000 left.


626
0:22:12,41 --> 0:22:14,81
We figure out, is there
anything else we can do?


627
0:22:14,81 --> 0:22:16,46
And we have great
tips in the book.


628
0:22:16,46 --> 0:22:19,6
And our planners
literally work and tweak,


629
0:22:19,6 --> 0:22:21,5
and we find a way, how do
we get $1,000 to be $2,000?


630
0:22:21,5 --> 0:22:24,4
Because we can get you towards
your goal so much faster.


631
0:22:24,4 --> 0:22:25,56
So we help you figure
out how to cut costs,


632
0:22:25,56 --> 0:22:27,39
things you can turn
off, really great hacks.


633
0:22:27,39 --> 0:22:28,73
And basically, we
come up with what's


634
0:22:28,73 --> 0:22:30,188
the number at the
end of the month?


635
0:22:30,188 --> 0:22:32,3
Let's just say it's $2,000.


636
0:22:32,3 --> 0:22:33,76
Next.


637
0:22:33,76 --> 0:22:35,49
So one thing is, you
go to your budget.


638
0:22:35,49 --> 0:22:39,1
This is a really important
financial planning principal.


639
0:22:39,1 --> 0:22:42,13
So I'm a CFP, just so you
guys all know what that means.


640
0:22:42,13 --> 0:22:45,6
It basically means you have to
go to school for about a year.


641
0:22:45,6 --> 0:22:46,6
Pass many tests.


642
0:22:46,6 --> 0:22:49,572
You then have to take a
two day, 10 hour exam.


643
0:22:49,572 --> 0:22:52,3
And honestly, it's the hardest
exam I've ever been through.


644
0:22:52,3 --> 0:22:53,92
It's only about a 30% pass rate.


645
0:22:53,92 --> 0:22:56,96
It's not only extremely
broad in the topics


646
0:22:56,96 --> 0:22:59,57
it covers, but extremely deep.


647
0:22:59,57 --> 0:23:1,32
And this is one of
the best principles


648
0:23:1,32 --> 0:23:2,63
that I learned in it.


649
0:23:2,63 --> 0:23:4,127
So, I didn't make
it up, but it's


650
0:23:4,127 --> 0:23:6,46
one of the things that sort
of changed my life, in terms


651
0:23:6,46 --> 0:23:7,74
of thinking about my money.


652
0:23:7,74 --> 0:23:10,19
So let's just say, for
the sake of this example,


653
0:23:10,19 --> 0:23:13,13
that my household makes
$10,000, after taxes.


654
0:23:13,13 --> 0:23:14,419
That's what comes in.


655
0:23:14,419 --> 0:23:16,46
So when you think about
living within your means,


656
0:23:16,46 --> 0:23:19,15
what that really
means, is 50% or less,


657
0:23:19,15 --> 0:23:20,63
should go to essentials.


658
0:23:20,63 --> 0:23:23,12
Essential is what this
actually essential to live.


659
0:23:23,12 --> 0:23:25,89
It's the roof over your
head, it's your groceries,


660
0:23:25,89 --> 0:23:28,402
it's your utility bill, and
it's your transportation


661
0:23:28,402 --> 0:23:29,11
to and from work.


662
0:23:29,11 --> 0:23:30,77
So for you guys, you drive.


663
0:23:30,77 --> 0:23:33,41
So it's not just whatever
your car payment is.


664
0:23:33,41 --> 0:23:35,87
Your auto insurance,
and your gas.


665
0:23:35,87 --> 0:23:37,63
So that's what's essential.


666
0:23:37,63 --> 0:23:39,92
Ideally that's 50% or less.


667
0:23:39,92 --> 0:23:42,4
One of the reasons is, if
you're a two person household,


668
0:23:42,4 --> 0:23:44,15
if someone lost their
job, you would still


669
0:23:44,15 --> 0:23:45,608
be able to maintain
your essentials


670
0:23:45,608 --> 0:23:47,45
without going into debt.


671
0:23:47,45 --> 0:23:53,21
A really important about that
50% is, of the 100, 30% or less


672
0:23:53,21 --> 0:23:55,18
is your rent or mortgage.


673
0:23:55,18 --> 0:23:57,63
So this is the one that
people get wildly wrong.


674
0:23:57,63 --> 0:24:0,13
And I can't tell you the number
of people that will come in,


675
0:24:0,13 --> 0:24:3,3
and their rent or their mortgage
is 60% of what they make.


676
0:24:3,3 --> 0:24:6,0
And we can see in
a 10 second window,


677
0:24:6,0 --> 0:24:8,8
that you're going to
have a pretty jeopardized


678
0:24:8,8 --> 0:24:10,53
financial future, because
of that one decision.


679
0:24:10,53 --> 0:24:13,39
And I say that for
the following reason.


680
0:24:13,39 --> 0:24:16,361
20% is supposed to go
towards the future.


681
0:24:16,361 --> 0:24:17,61
And I'll walk you through why.


682
0:24:17,61 --> 0:24:19,57
But 20% of what you
take home every month


683
0:24:19,57 --> 0:24:21,779
should go to if you have
debt, paying down your debt.


684
0:24:21,779 --> 0:24:23,278
If you don't have
debt, contributing


685
0:24:23,278 --> 0:24:24,1
to your retirement.


686
0:24:24,1 --> 0:24:26,16
If you are already maxing
out your retirement,


687
0:24:26,16 --> 0:24:28,35
your next savings goal,
whatever it may be.


688
0:24:28,35 --> 0:24:30,58
Whether it's saving
for your kids 529 Plan,


689
0:24:30,58 --> 0:24:32,88
helping with some dream,
some small project


690
0:24:32,88 --> 0:24:35,38
you want to work on,
whatever it may be.


691
0:24:35,38 --> 0:24:37,534
And then, 30% is the fun stuff.


692
0:24:37,534 --> 0:24:38,7
That's the lifestyle budget.


693
0:24:38,7 --> 0:24:40,52
That's the like do you
want to go shopping?


694
0:24:40,52 --> 0:24:41,394
Do want to go travel?


695
0:24:41,394 --> 0:24:44,26
Do you want to have an
Equinox membership, etc.


696
0:24:44,26 --> 0:24:46,78
And one of the reasons why
people often will be like,


697
0:24:46,78 --> 0:24:48,58
well my rent's 60%.


698
0:24:48,58 --> 0:24:50,384
And we're like, well
your 20%'s gone.


699
0:24:50,384 --> 0:24:51,8
And the truth is,
you can't really


700
0:24:51,8 --> 0:24:55,1
live on your 30%
being anything--


701
0:24:55,1 --> 0:24:58,49
we say-- people are like,
but I can make that 10%.


702
0:24:58,49 --> 0:24:59,867
Well here's the problem.


703
0:24:59,867 --> 0:25:1,95
Every time your phone
rings, literally every time,


704
0:25:1,95 --> 0:25:4,1
someone's calling you to
ask you to spend money.


705
0:25:4,1 --> 0:25:5,57
They're calling, do you
want to go for margaritas?


706
0:25:5,57 --> 0:25:6,37
Do you wanna go to the gym?


707
0:25:6,37 --> 0:25:7,5
Do you wanna go to the game?


708
0:25:7,5 --> 0:25:8,45
Do you wanna meet for yoga?


709
0:25:8,45 --> 0:25:9,79
Do you wanna get a manicure?


710
0:25:9,79 --> 0:25:11,984
Your parents need
something, doesn't matter.


711
0:25:11,984 --> 0:25:13,4
Every time someone's
calling you ,


712
0:25:13,4 --> 0:25:15,7
they're asking you to do
something that requires money.


713
0:25:15,7 --> 0:25:18,91
And people just don't have the
willpower to always say no.


714
0:25:18,91 --> 0:25:21,29
That's also not a
fun life to live.


715
0:25:21,29 --> 0:25:23,38
And so what we find is,
if you are in a position


716
0:25:23,38 --> 0:25:26,91
where your rent is more than
30% of what you take home,


717
0:25:26,91 --> 0:25:29,63
you often end up
in a big mistake.


718
0:25:29,63 --> 0:25:31,39
You're not saving
enough for the future.


719
0:25:31,39 --> 0:25:34,35
You're in a position where
you wildly have to underspend,


720
0:25:34,35 --> 0:25:36,58
which is pretty difficult
for a lot of people.


721
0:25:36,58 --> 0:25:38,246
And so the takeaway
there is, my mentor,


722
0:25:38,246 --> 0:25:40,35
she's one of the early
founders of Goldman Sachs.


723
0:25:40,35 --> 0:25:42,5
And she's on the board of
Goldman Sachs, said to me


724
0:25:42,5 --> 0:25:45,48
early when we were building
LearnVest together, she goes,


725
0:25:45,48 --> 0:25:47,9
Alexa, the number
one thing you can


726
0:25:47,9 --> 0:25:49,13
do to always keep your
finances in shape,


727
0:25:49,13 --> 0:25:50,59
is always spend
beneath your needs


728
0:25:50,59 --> 0:25:51,98
in your living environment.


729
0:25:51,98 --> 0:25:54,37
And so if it's rent,
that's pretty clear.


730
0:25:54,37 --> 0:25:57,86
But for your mortgage, is
what we call PITY, principal


731
0:25:57,86 --> 0:25:59,981
and interest, taxes
and insurance,


732
0:25:59,981 --> 0:26:1,73
because those are the
four things that you


733
0:26:1,73 --> 0:26:4,41
must have in order to be
able to afford that home.


734
0:26:4,41 --> 0:26:7,34
So right now, if
you're way over 30%,


735
0:26:7,34 --> 0:26:9,46
we don't recommend you
go sell your house.


736
0:26:9,46 --> 0:26:12,36
It's just, you need to be aware
that you're actually at risk.


737
0:26:12,36 --> 0:26:14,746
So next.


738
0:26:14,746 --> 0:26:16,12
Really quickly,
on credit scores,


739
0:26:16,12 --> 0:26:18,286
this is one of the ones
guys, that I can't tell you,


740
0:26:18,286 --> 0:26:21,39
I had like almost a full
hour of questions last night


741
0:26:21,39 --> 0:26:21,89
about this.


742
0:26:21,89 --> 0:26:23,68
And it's pretty regular.


743
0:26:23,68 --> 0:26:25,989
Here's the takeaway, your
credit score really matters.


744
0:26:25,989 --> 0:26:28,3
As extremely smart, talented
people in this room,


745
0:26:28,3 --> 0:26:29,66
it is the only
grade that matters


746
0:26:29,66 --> 0:26:31,4
after you leave the
education system.


747
0:26:31,4 --> 0:26:32,86
And here's why it matters.


748
0:26:32,86 --> 0:26:34,71
So over my life, in
the next 60 years,


749
0:26:34,71 --> 0:26:36,75
I'm gonna buy probably
four or five homes.


750
0:26:36,75 --> 0:26:39,29
I'm probably also going
to like, get a nice car,


751
0:26:39,29 --> 0:26:41,69
start another business,
whatever it may be.


752
0:26:41,69 --> 0:26:43,13
Every time I go
to borrow, they're


753
0:26:43,13 --> 0:26:44,26
going to look at one number.


754
0:26:44,26 --> 0:26:46,385
They're going to be like,
what's your credit score?


755
0:26:46,385 --> 0:26:49,18
They'll look at your income too,
but that's basically the grade.


756
0:26:49,18 --> 0:26:53,6
From there, it's the difference
of 4% interest or 3% interest,


757
0:26:53,6 --> 0:26:55,4
based on what it looks like.


758
0:26:55,4 --> 0:26:59,63
Over 40 or 50 years, that
could be more than $100,000,


759
0:26:59,63 --> 0:27:2,12
$200,000, of saved
earnings in interest,


760
0:27:2,12 --> 0:27:3,69
because my credit score is good.


761
0:27:3,69 --> 0:27:4,402
It's that simple.


762
0:27:4,402 --> 0:27:6,61
And again, this is literally
why I was in Washington.


763
0:27:6,61 --> 0:27:9,49
I was making it so that credit
scores, and giving college kids


764
0:27:9,49 --> 0:27:11,17
credit cards,
should be outlawed.


765
0:27:11,17 --> 0:27:13,87
The average college senior
gets their credit score


766
0:27:13,87 --> 0:27:16,55
on like, Freshman welcome day,
with a free piece of pizza.


767
0:27:16,55 --> 0:27:19,15
And they graduate with
$4,000 in credit card debt.


768
0:27:19,15 --> 0:27:20,39
And they're already
in a position


769
0:27:20,39 --> 0:27:22,621
where they also have
$20,000 in student debt


770
0:27:22,621 --> 0:27:24,995
and they make less than that
in their first few years out


771
0:27:24,995 --> 0:27:25,662
of school.


772
0:27:25,662 --> 0:27:27,37
So as a result, it's
really hard for them


773
0:27:27,37 --> 0:27:28,89
to change that situation.


774
0:27:28,89 --> 0:27:31,4
So, credit score really matters.


775
0:27:31,4 --> 0:27:33,52
It ranges from 300 to 850.


776
0:27:33,52 --> 0:27:36,5
Everyone in this room, you
want it to be about 700.


777
0:27:36,5 --> 0:27:37,95
Ideally, it's above 760.


778
0:27:37,95 --> 0:27:39,19
That's considered excellent.


779
0:27:39,19 --> 0:27:40,461
That makes a big difference.


780
0:27:40,461 --> 0:27:41,71
And here are the three things.


781
0:27:41,71 --> 0:27:43,63
Only look at the top three,
because the ones at the bottom


782
0:27:43,63 --> 0:27:45,124
aren't even worth your time.


783
0:27:45,124 --> 0:27:46,29
Number one, payment history.


784
0:27:46,29 --> 0:27:47,34
Never miss a bill.


785
0:27:47,34 --> 0:27:50,63
Missing a bill knocks it about
60 points, even up to 100.


786
0:27:50,63 --> 0:27:54,28
And it takes literally a year,
two years, three years to fix.


787
0:27:54,28 --> 0:27:57,17
Something as simple as
an $86 dermatology bill.


788
0:27:57,17 --> 0:27:59,97
Number two, is your
credit utilization rate.


789
0:27:59,97 --> 0:28:1,63
So what's important
about this, and it


790
0:28:1,63 --> 0:28:4,262
sounds like a complicated
concept, it's not.


791
0:28:4,262 --> 0:28:5,97
Let's just pretend I
had one credit card,


792
0:28:5,97 --> 0:28:8,22
and it was $10,000,
that was my limit.


793
0:28:8,22 --> 0:28:11,42
So I have one credit card,
let's just say $10,000 limit.


794
0:28:11,42 --> 0:28:14,14
If you're carrying no debt, you
don't have to care about this.


795
0:28:14,14 --> 0:28:16,39
If you're carrying zero
credit card debt at all times,


796
0:28:16,39 --> 0:28:18,22
you always pay
your bills in full,


797
0:28:18,22 --> 0:28:20,74
you're at 0% for that
credit utilization.


798
0:28:20,74 --> 0:28:21,68
You're in good shape.


799
0:28:21,68 --> 0:28:23,66
If you are carrying
debt, and let's say


800
0:28:23,66 --> 0:28:26,35
that I'm carrying $5,000
of debt on that one credit


801
0:28:26,35 --> 0:28:31,8
card, that $10,000 limit, I'm
utilizing my limit at 50%.


802
0:28:31,8 --> 0:28:34,19
If it's above 50%,
red flags go off.


803
0:28:34,19 --> 0:28:37,94
So you first, want to get your
credit below 30% utilization.


804
0:28:37,94 --> 0:28:39,97
Which means, across
all your credit cards,


805
0:28:39,97 --> 0:28:42,32
you have to know what
your total limit is.


806
0:28:42,32 --> 0:28:44,31
But Additionally, the
takeaway, the big thing


807
0:28:44,31 --> 0:28:46,65
here is, just pay down your
debt as quickly as you can.


808
0:28:46,65 --> 0:28:50,15
That's the best way to improve
this, and it is a huge portion.


809
0:28:50,15 --> 0:28:52,53
And then finally, your
length of history.


810
0:28:52,53 --> 0:28:54,7
So, the take away
here is, you want


811
0:28:54,7 --> 0:28:56,403
to go to annual credit report
once a year, as I told you


812
0:28:56,403 --> 0:28:57,51
in the beginning.


813
0:28:57,51 --> 0:28:59,49
You want to print out
that credit report.


814
0:28:59,49 --> 0:29:0,99
And you wanna look
at all the things


815
0:29:0,99 --> 0:29:3,25
that are associated with
your social security number.


816
0:29:3,25 --> 0:29:5,64
I promise you, you
will find mistakes.


817
0:29:5,64 --> 0:29:6,437
Most people do.


818
0:29:6,437 --> 0:29:8,2
And the takeaway is,
you want to know,


819
0:29:8,2 --> 0:29:9,52
not only what's
associated with you,


820
0:29:9,52 --> 0:29:12,37
so that you can dispute
anything that's not yours.


821
0:29:12,37 --> 0:29:13,884
But also, you may
find, you know,


822
0:29:13,884 --> 0:29:15,8
that silly Bloomingdale's
credit card that you


823
0:29:15,8 --> 0:29:18,4
opened to save 15%,
blah, blah, blah.


824
0:29:18,4 --> 0:29:19,92
And the takeaway there
is, what you want to do


825
0:29:19,92 --> 0:29:22,27
is, never close your
oldest credit card.


826
0:29:22,27 --> 0:29:25,81
And the reason being is, that's
your longest line of history.


827
0:29:25,81 --> 0:29:27,811
So that's what goes
into your credit score.


828
0:29:27,811 --> 0:29:28,56
It really matters.


829
0:29:28,56 --> 0:29:30,15
And the takeaway is,
don't miss bills,


830
0:29:30,15 --> 0:29:32,35
pay your debt down to zero, and
don't close your oldest credit


831
0:29:32,35 --> 0:29:32,945
card.


832
0:29:32,945 --> 0:29:34,82
One important thing is
if you're sitting here


833
0:29:34,82 --> 0:29:37,54
and you have seven credit cards,
don't go out and close all


834
0:29:37,54 --> 0:29:38,72
them.


835
0:29:38,72 --> 0:29:40,8
You really can only
close one credit per year


836
0:29:40,8 --> 0:29:42,69
because it affects
that utilization.


837
0:29:42,69 --> 0:29:44,28
What it does is,
it starts quickly


838
0:29:44,28 --> 0:29:47,58
lowering your ability
for limit very quickly.


839
0:29:47,58 --> 0:29:49,52
And it can make or
your credit score dip.


840
0:29:49,52 --> 0:29:51,436
So don't do anything
major with your credit.


841
0:29:51,436 --> 0:29:53,81
Also, if you're going out and
borrowing in the next year,


842
0:29:53,81 --> 0:29:56,459
or going back to grad school,
or anything like that, because


843
0:29:56,459 --> 0:29:57,5
it will dip a little bit.


844
0:29:57,5 --> 0:29:58,2
So.


845
0:29:58,2 --> 0:29:59,645
I love the site called
CreditKarma.com.


846
0:29:59,645 --> 0:30:0,527
I know the founders.


847
0:30:0,527 --> 0:30:1,36
They're good people.


848
0:30:1,36 --> 0:30:3,17
They have the same mission
that LearnVest does.


849
0:30:3,17 --> 0:30:3,92
To empower people.


850
0:30:3,92 --> 0:30:6,41
And you can check your
credit score there for free.


851
0:30:6,41 --> 0:30:8,41
Next.


852
0:30:8,41 --> 0:30:10,202
After all of that's
done, you're organized,


853
0:30:10,202 --> 0:30:12,201
you know your numbers,
you know where you stand,


854
0:30:12,201 --> 0:30:14,29
you know your net worth,
then we go into Planning.


855
0:30:14,29 --> 0:30:16,51
So go back to, remember
I said my household,


856
0:30:16,51 --> 0:30:18,203
let's just say at
the end of it, I


857
0:30:18,203 --> 0:30:20,6
have $2,000 of free
money every month.


858
0:30:20,6 --> 0:30:22,28
So we then make
that money, it has


859
0:30:22,28 --> 0:30:23,99
to go essentially
to three things.


860
0:30:23,99 --> 0:30:26,6
This is three priorities
before anything else.


861
0:30:26,6 --> 0:30:29,3
First, paying down your debt.


862
0:30:29,3 --> 0:30:31,26
Second, is dealing
with your retirement


863
0:30:31,26 --> 0:30:33,15
and making sure that
you're on track.


864
0:30:33,15 --> 0:30:35,59
And we run this really
simple rule for you.


865
0:30:35,59 --> 0:30:38,6
We can take anyone in this
room, find out how old you are,


866
0:30:38,6 --> 0:30:41,3
find out what lifestyle you
would like in retirement,


867
0:30:41,3 --> 0:30:43,8
and look at your account and we
can tell you if you're on track


868
0:30:43,8 --> 0:30:43,81
or not.


869
0:30:43,81 --> 0:30:46,35
And then finally, an
emergency savings account.


870
0:30:46,35 --> 0:30:48,15
So when you think about
financial planning,


871
0:30:48,15 --> 0:30:49,8
these are three
essential pillars


872
0:30:49,8 --> 0:30:51,36
that are critical to starting.


873
0:30:51,36 --> 0:30:53,61
And I can't tell you the
number of really smart people


874
0:30:53,61 --> 0:30:56,33
that start being like, I wanna
invest and I wanna buy a home.


875
0:30:56,33 --> 0:30:58,51
And we're like, you
can't do that until you


876
0:30:58,51 --> 0:31:0,39
make sure you've covered
these three things.


877
0:31:0,39 --> 0:31:2,31
So let's run through
them really fast.


878
0:31:2,31 --> 0:31:3,78
And guys I'm gonna go a
little faster because there's


879
0:31:3,78 --> 0:31:6,6
a ton of good content in
here I wanna get through.


880
0:31:6,6 --> 0:31:8,3
So really quickly,
good debt, bad debt.


881
0:31:8,3 --> 0:31:9,82
All debt is not created equal.


882
0:31:9,82 --> 0:31:12,68
Bad debt is credit card
debt, and it's car loans.


883
0:31:12,68 --> 0:31:15,36
The second you drive a car off
the lot, depreciating asset.


884
0:31:15,36 --> 0:31:17,89
So, any debt that has
a depreciating asset,


885
0:31:17,89 --> 0:31:20,19
is considered bad debt, and
it hurts your credit score,


886
0:31:20,19 --> 0:31:21,63
and you want to get rid of it.


887
0:31:21,63 --> 0:31:25,4
Good debt is things like
student debt and your mortgage.


888
0:31:25,4 --> 0:31:27,85
The asset in a house,
hopefully it goes up in value


889
0:31:27,85 --> 0:31:29,58
and it's not considered
as negatively


890
0:31:29,58 --> 0:31:30,8
against your credit score.


891
0:31:30,8 --> 0:31:33,575
And then student debt, and guys,
you know, the entire nation


892
0:31:33,575 --> 0:31:36,264
is under a trillion
dollars of student debt.


893
0:31:36,264 --> 0:31:38,68
So I can't tell you the number
of people who have come in.


894
0:31:38,68 --> 0:31:39,68
My brothers are doctors.


895
0:31:39,68 --> 0:31:41,39
One's a surgeon.


896
0:31:41,39 --> 0:31:43,68
Hundreds of thousands of
dollars of student debt.


897
0:31:43,68 --> 0:31:46,18
The good thing there is, the
government has set up a system,


898
0:31:46,18 --> 0:31:49,5
because our brain is the asset,
and they're investing in us,


899
0:31:49,5 --> 0:31:51,439
so that we can actually
earn greater for the future.


900
0:31:51,439 --> 0:31:53,23
The one takeaway there
is, I can't tell you


901
0:31:53,23 --> 0:31:54,47
the number of people
that come and say,


902
0:31:54,47 --> 0:31:55,95
I'm going to go to x school.


903
0:31:55,95 --> 0:31:59,15
I'm gonna pay $100,000 to get a
master's degree, and I'm like,


904
0:31:59,15 --> 0:32:1,95
is it going to increase your
salary enough to pay it down?


905
0:32:1,95 --> 0:32:4,37
So don't just collect
degrees for the sake of it.


906
0:32:4,37 --> 0:32:6,74
If it can't increase your
salary, it's pretty tough.


907
0:32:6,74 --> 0:32:8,26
Next.


908
0:32:8,26 --> 0:32:9,21
So, retirement.


909
0:32:9,21 --> 0:32:11,35
This is a really simple graph.


910
0:32:11,35 --> 0:32:13,74
I brilliantly came up with
it, it's so complicated.


911
0:32:13,74 --> 0:32:14,9
It's so simple.


912
0:32:14,9 --> 0:32:16,3
You're 25 years old.


913
0:32:16,3 --> 0:32:18,29
I wanna retire at 65.


914
0:32:18,29 --> 0:32:20,23
I live to 95.


915
0:32:20,23 --> 0:32:24,28
So I work for 40 years
to fund 70 years.


916
0:32:24,28 --> 0:32:25,62
Plain and simple.


917
0:32:25,62 --> 0:32:27,53
I only really work
for half the time


918
0:32:27,53 --> 0:32:29,19
that I will be funding myself.


919
0:32:29,19 --> 0:32:31,61
So if you are not
putting away at least 20%


920
0:32:31,61 --> 0:32:34,15
towards the future, you're
not going to be on track.


921
0:32:34,15 --> 0:32:34,886
It's that simple.


922
0:32:34,886 --> 0:32:36,26
And I was literally
with the head


923
0:32:36,26 --> 0:32:38,84
of the treasury for
all Colorado yesterday.


924
0:32:38,84 --> 0:32:41,41
And we were talking about
the fact that, literally


925
0:32:41,41 --> 0:32:42,85
quick history tip here.


926
0:32:42,85 --> 0:32:45,64
In the '70s, pretty much all
of our parents, a lot of them,


927
0:32:45,64 --> 0:32:47,37
had pensions and
Social Security.


928
0:32:47,37 --> 0:32:50,51
They literally, we, as a country
would fund your retirement.


929
0:32:50,51 --> 0:32:52,66
The problem is, great
science is happening.


930
0:32:52,66 --> 0:32:53,95
We're living much longer.


931
0:32:53,95 --> 0:32:56,85
And companies started flailing
because growing populations,


932
0:32:56,85 --> 0:32:58,27
they weren't able to keep up.


933
0:32:58,27 --> 0:33:0,21
So what happened is, we went
from a very paternalistic


934
0:33:0,21 --> 0:33:2,81
government, where we were trying
to fund people in retirement,


935
0:33:2,81 --> 0:33:6,25
and we shifted it to you and us
all funding our own retirement,


936
0:33:6,25 --> 0:33:7,81
via the 401K.


937
0:33:7,81 --> 0:33:10,332
The big problem was, there
was no education about that.


938
0:33:10,332 --> 0:33:11,79
So they gave us
the responsibility,


939
0:33:11,79 --> 0:33:14,54
but didn't make us really
understand the big impact.


940
0:33:14,54 --> 0:33:17,61
And the result is, most people
are off track for retirement.


941
0:33:17,61 --> 0:33:20,66
And it's really tough,
because a lot of our parents


942
0:33:20,66 --> 0:33:21,97
are not going to be on track.


943
0:33:21,97 --> 0:33:24,136
And so it means that we
will be funding our parents.


944
0:33:24,136 --> 0:33:26,77
And I'm telling you guys, I see
this from even affluent people.


945
0:33:26,77 --> 0:33:29,57
Where there just like, my mom's
living til she's 98 years old.


946
0:33:29,57 --> 0:33:32,17
And it's $100,00 to have care.


947
0:33:32,17 --> 0:33:33,59
It's very expensive.


948
0:33:33,59 --> 0:33:36,449
And as a result, our money
could be filtering out.


949
0:33:36,449 --> 0:33:38,99
Which means, we're worse off,
and our children are worse off.


950
0:33:38,99 --> 0:33:41,9
And it's this huge
domino effect.


951
0:33:41,9 --> 0:33:43,63
So the takeaway here
is, walk away from here,


952
0:33:43,63 --> 0:33:44,85
increase your 401K.


953
0:33:44,85 --> 0:33:47,6
If your 401K maxed
out, which is awesome,


954
0:33:47,6 --> 0:33:48,68
go contribute to an IRA.


955
0:33:48,68 --> 0:33:49,8
Next.


956
0:33:49,8 --> 0:33:50,67
Quick graph.


957
0:33:50,67 --> 0:33:53,12
When I was Harvard undergrad,
I was like such a math dork,


958
0:33:53,12 --> 0:33:56,5
that I like went to a money
presentation that I found.


959
0:33:56,5 --> 0:33:58,15
And here's the
really simple things.


960
0:33:58,15 --> 0:33:59,6
Compounding interest.


961
0:33:59,6 --> 0:34:0,33
It's not magic it's math.


962
0:34:0,33 --> 0:34:2,1
And Jessica starts
when she's 20.


963
0:34:2,1 --> 0:34:4,64
She puts away the same
dollar amount as Kate.


964
0:34:4,64 --> 0:34:7,88
Literally at retirement,
simply putting the same dollars


965
0:34:7,88 --> 0:34:10,81
but with a 20 year
difference, what happens


966
0:34:10,81 --> 0:34:13,96
is, Jessica has over a quarter
of a million dollars more.


967
0:34:13,96 --> 0:34:15,585
So if you think about
the biggest hacks


968
0:34:15,585 --> 0:34:17,199
that you can possibly
come up with,


969
0:34:17,199 --> 0:34:19,639
right now, before you have
a lot of responsibilities,


970
0:34:19,639 --> 0:34:22,659
put away as much money as
possible into retirement.


971
0:34:22,659 --> 0:34:23,73
That's the takeaway.


972
0:34:23,73 --> 0:34:25,219
And one thing you
guys should know,


973
0:34:25,219 --> 0:34:27,139
is we see a lot of
people in their late '30s


974
0:34:27,139 --> 0:34:29,19
early '40s with a few
kids, with mortgages,


975
0:34:29,19 --> 0:34:30,8
thinking about
their kids college.


976
0:34:30,8 --> 0:34:32,55
And they never contributed
to their retirement.


977
0:34:32,55 --> 0:34:35,175
And it's really hard once you're
in that position, where you're


978
0:34:35,175 --> 0:34:37,397
running a full household,
to find extra money.


979
0:34:37,397 --> 0:34:39,48
So the takeaway is, you
want to contribute ideally


980
0:34:39,48 --> 0:34:41,7
before you have kids.


981
0:34:41,7 --> 0:34:43,86
And again, wish this was a
class, before you have kids.


982
0:34:43,86 --> 0:34:46,62
Because once you do have a
family, it gets much harder.


983
0:34:46,62 --> 0:34:49,37
And this is a great
earning audience,


984
0:34:49,37 --> 0:34:51,219
so you will always
be able to be maybe


985
0:34:51,219 --> 0:34:52,995
better off the average American.


986
0:34:52,995 --> 0:34:54,12
But it's still pretty hard.


987
0:34:54,12 --> 0:34:55,42
And so, I'm lazy.


988
0:34:55,42 --> 0:34:56,1
Start early.


989
0:34:56,1 --> 0:34:57,51
It does the work for you.


990
0:34:57,51 --> 0:34:58,69
Which is great.


991
0:34:58,69 --> 0:34:59,752
Step four, is Build.


992
0:34:59,752 --> 0:35:1,21
So then, after we
get through that.


993
0:35:1,21 --> 0:35:2,85
We've made sure those
three things are on track


994
0:35:2,85 --> 0:35:3,87
and have a game plan.


995
0:35:3,87 --> 0:35:5,93
In step four, this
is when you should


996
0:35:5,93 --> 0:35:7,78
start to think about
the other things.


997
0:35:7,78 --> 0:35:9,53
Am I having children?


998
0:35:9,53 --> 0:35:10,29
Do I like my home?


999
0:35:10,29 --> 0:35:11,581
Do we want to upgrade our home?


1000
0:35:11,581 --> 0:35:13,87
Are we thinking about
starting a small business?


1001
0:35:13,87 --> 0:35:15,73
Are we thinking about
a vacation to Tahiti?


1002
0:35:15,73 --> 0:35:18,405
I love the customers that walk
in the door and their like,


1003
0:35:18,405 --> 0:35:20,7
I truly wanna go on a trip.


1004
0:35:20,7 --> 0:35:22,3
And we're like, let's
first make sure that we


1005
0:35:22,3 --> 0:35:24,7
can cover you and protect you.


1006
0:35:24,7 --> 0:35:26,6
So, then we start to
build towards the future.


1007
0:35:26,6 --> 0:35:27,95
We have these really
great tracking devices.


1008
0:35:27,95 --> 0:35:29,47
It's all through
the money center,


1009
0:35:29,47 --> 0:35:30,554
that you can set up goals.


1010
0:35:30,554 --> 0:35:32,761
We show you how many months
you're going to be there,


1011
0:35:32,761 --> 0:35:34,42
and we do it all
automatically for you.


1012
0:35:34,42 --> 0:35:36,371
Step five is Protect.


1013
0:35:36,371 --> 0:35:38,87
And I'm going to take an extra
few minutes on this one guys,


1014
0:35:38,87 --> 0:35:41,46
because this is one of
the most important things


1015
0:35:41,46 --> 0:35:43,86
that you will learn that
I will say here today.


1016
0:35:43,86 --> 0:35:48,95
So, my same mentor who was
a professor at Columbia


1017
0:35:48,95 --> 0:35:50,45
basically was like,
Alexa, what if I


1018
0:35:50,45 --> 0:35:52,657
could promise that you
will never go bankrupt.


1019
0:35:52,657 --> 0:35:53,99
I'm like, that'd be pretty cool.


1020
0:35:53,99 --> 0:35:54,76
Put me in coach.


1021
0:35:54,76 --> 0:35:55,98
What do I have to do?


1022
0:35:55,98 --> 0:35:59,296
And the takeaway was,
be properly insured.


1023
0:35:59,296 --> 0:36:0,67
LearnVest doesn't
sell insurance.


1024
0:36:0,67 --> 0:36:2,91
In fact, I don't like people,
typically, who sell insurance.


1025
0:36:2,91 --> 0:36:4,88
Because they get big
chunks of commission.


1026
0:36:4,88 --> 0:36:7,22
And they typically tell you
probably more than you need.


1027
0:36:7,22 --> 0:36:10,93
But what is important about
this is, insurance is actually,


1028
0:36:10,93 --> 0:36:12,99
in the financial
planning exam, it's


1029
0:36:12,99 --> 0:36:14,7
step one of a financial plan.


1030
0:36:14,7 --> 0:36:16,69
We made it step
five, because people


1031
0:36:16,69 --> 0:36:18,29
tend to be pretty daunted by it.


1032
0:36:18,29 --> 0:36:20,167
And it's not a sexy topic.


1033
0:36:20,167 --> 0:36:20,75
It is not fun.


1034
0:36:20,75 --> 0:36:22,874
I actually joke that I
drank a whole bottle of wine


1035
0:36:22,874 --> 0:36:25,84
while I was writing the
chapter on Protect Yourself.


1036
0:36:25,84 --> 0:36:28,15
But it is so critical, you guys.


1037
0:36:28,15 --> 0:36:30,67
And let me give you a
few important examples.


1038
0:36:30,67 --> 0:36:35,58
So first, 62% of the country
that went bankrupt this year,


1039
0:36:35,58 --> 0:36:39,24
went bankrupt not because
they didn't have insurance,


1040
0:36:39,24 --> 0:36:41,195
because they were
improperly insured.


1041
0:36:41,195 --> 0:36:43,32
Meaning, they didn't know
what they're riders said.


1042
0:36:43,32 --> 0:36:46,53
They didn't know Hurricane
Sandy-- my husband's family had


1043
0:36:46,53 --> 0:36:49,4
a house in this place
called Breezy Point.


1044
0:36:49,4 --> 0:36:51,42
Literally most people lost
almost everything they had.


1045
0:36:51,42 --> 0:36:52,636
And it was because
they didn't know


1046
0:36:52,636 --> 0:36:54,3
that they didn't
have flood insurance.


1047
0:36:54,3 --> 0:36:56,6
And when it flooded, sorry.


1048
0:36:56,6 --> 0:36:57,55
That's not covered.


1049
0:36:57,55 --> 0:36:59,695
And it's literally
critical for you to know,


1050
0:36:59,695 --> 0:37:1,93
what's not covered,
what is covered.


1051
0:37:1,93 --> 0:37:3,93
Am I in a place where, I
was in Denver yesterday


1052
0:37:3,93 --> 0:37:4,88
with tornadoes.


1053
0:37:4,88 --> 0:37:6,17
Do you have tornado coverage?


1054
0:37:6,17 --> 0:37:7,11
You need it.


1055
0:37:7,11 --> 0:37:9,57
If you're in California,
earthquake coverage.


1056
0:37:9,57 --> 0:37:11,11
And the takeaway
here is, I'm going


1057
0:37:11,11 --> 0:37:14,84
to walk through all the
types but, insurance.


1058
0:37:14,84 --> 0:37:17,14
One, it's not that
expensive, often.


1059
0:37:17,14 --> 0:37:18,9
But it is critical
that you layer it


1060
0:37:18,9 --> 0:37:20,7
into your financial plan.


1061
0:37:20,7 --> 0:37:22,58
And one thing for me, you
know, I built LearnVest,


1062
0:37:22,58 --> 0:37:24,39
not because I want
people to be rich,


1063
0:37:24,39 --> 0:37:26,51
but I want people to be
able to enrich their life.


1064
0:37:26,51 --> 0:37:28,74
And for me, what's invaluable,
is financial security.


1065
0:37:28,74 --> 0:37:31,5
So that anything in
the world can happen,


1066
0:37:31,5 --> 0:37:32,8
and I don't have to
worry about the money.


1067
0:37:32,8 --> 0:37:34,69
You can lose your job tomorrow,
and you have a game plan


1068
0:37:34,69 --> 0:37:35,7
to figure that out.


1069
0:37:35,7 --> 0:37:37,89
Someone in your family can
get sick, and you're OK.


1070
0:37:37,89 --> 0:37:39,64
And you guys are going
to be able to focus


1071
0:37:39,64 --> 0:37:41,88
on the person who's
sick, not all the money


1072
0:37:41,88 --> 0:37:43,51
implications of it.


1073
0:37:43,51 --> 0:37:45,76
And when I promise you,
like life will happen.


1074
0:37:45,76 --> 0:37:47,1
I share in the first
chapter of the book,


1075
0:37:47,1 --> 0:37:48,766
one of the reasons
I'm really passionate


1076
0:37:48,766 --> 0:37:50,58
about personal finance
is, when I was 14,


1077
0:37:50,58 --> 0:37:52,2
my dad unexpectedly passed away.


1078
0:37:52,2 --> 0:37:53,95
My mom had three kids.


1079
0:37:53,95 --> 0:37:56,7
And she didn't even know
where our money was.


1080
0:37:56,7 --> 0:37:58,3
So there, she was dealing
with a major life event,


1081
0:37:58,3 --> 0:38:0,65
scrambling to figure out
what to do with our finances.


1082
0:38:0,65 --> 0:38:3,49
And I think what's really
important is, in those moments,


1083
0:38:3,49 --> 0:38:4,59
that's why you have
a financial plan.


1084
0:38:4,59 --> 0:38:7,17
So you can look at
whoever's really suffering


1085
0:38:7,17 --> 0:38:9,83
and say, we're fine, we're
going to figure it out.


1086
0:38:9,83 --> 0:38:12,8
So the takeaway on insurance,
if you go through quickly.


1087
0:38:12,8 --> 0:38:14,15
Next slide.


1088
0:38:14,15 --> 0:38:16,27
So you can't read it, but I can.


1089
0:38:16,27 --> 0:38:18,25
You need homeowners,
and you need renters.


1090
0:38:18,25 --> 0:38:21,301
I have an employee who actually
literally just started, got


1091
0:38:21,301 --> 0:38:23,55
renters insurance, because
she's working at LearnVest,


1092
0:38:23,55 --> 0:38:25,8
and everyone who
works at LearnVest


1093
0:38:25,8 --> 0:38:26,38
has a full financial plan.


1094
0:38:26,38 --> 0:38:28,43
Her apartment was on
top of a pizza place


1095
0:38:28,43 --> 0:38:30,35
and the oven caught on fire,
and burned her entire apartment


1096
0:38:30,35 --> 0:38:30,9
down.


1097
0:38:30,9 --> 0:38:32,719
She lost 90% of what she owns.


1098
0:38:32,719 --> 0:38:33,51
And she came to me.


1099
0:38:33,51 --> 0:38:35,176
She had like two weeks
out of the office


1100
0:38:35,176 --> 0:38:36,34
to deal with the crisis.


1101
0:38:36,34 --> 0:38:39,53
She came to me was like, because
of you, I get all new stuff.


1102
0:38:39,53 --> 0:38:40,44
All new.


1103
0:38:40,44 --> 0:38:42,38
And renters insurance
is $20 month.


1104
0:38:42,38 --> 0:38:43,852
And I mean, these
stories happen,


1105
0:38:43,852 --> 0:38:45,6
and they happen all the time.


1106
0:38:45,6 --> 0:38:47,66
And I get to hear about them,
because all the emails come in.


1107
0:38:47,66 --> 0:38:48,43
But it's critical.


1108
0:38:48,43 --> 0:38:51,87
So homeowners insurance, and
you need renters insurance.


1109
0:38:51,87 --> 0:38:54,47
Disability, I'm pretty
positive that Google offers it.


1110
0:38:54,47 --> 0:38:55,93
Opt in today.


1111
0:38:55,93 --> 0:38:57,95
You are 10 times more
likely to be disabled then


1112
0:38:57,95 --> 0:38:58,93
you are to die.


1113
0:38:58,93 --> 0:39:1,465
And the takeaway there is,
if something bad happens,


1114
0:39:1,465 --> 0:39:2,84
you want to make
sure that you're


1115
0:39:2,84 --> 0:39:6,15
getting not just Any
occupation, but Own occupation.


1116
0:39:6,15 --> 0:39:7,14
That's the key.


1117
0:39:7,14 --> 0:39:9,73
That replaces whatever
salary you currently have.


1118
0:39:9,73 --> 0:39:11,96
If you have Any, so
let's say you work here,


1119
0:39:11,96 --> 0:39:13,7
and let's say you make $100,000.


1120
0:39:13,7 --> 0:39:16,609
And you have Any disability
insurance called Any.


1121
0:39:16,609 --> 0:39:18,9
What it means is, if you can
go work at McDonald's, you


1122
0:39:18,9 --> 0:39:20,27
don't get $1.


1123
0:39:20,27 --> 0:39:22,53
Because you get a $30,000
job at McDonald's.


1124
0:39:22,53 --> 0:39:25,66
So it's really important
that you know the difference.


1125
0:39:25,66 --> 0:39:26,864
Term, you need it.


1126
0:39:26,864 --> 0:39:28,78
You need, if you're
married, if you have kids,


1127
0:39:28,78 --> 0:39:30,11
you need life insurance.


1128
0:39:30,11 --> 0:39:31,927
And again, our
experts from LearnVest


1129
0:39:31,927 --> 0:39:33,51
will tell you the
exact dollar amount.


1130
0:39:33,51 --> 0:39:36,62
They will tell you exactly
what you really can afford,


1131
0:39:36,62 --> 0:39:38,167
and what you should
be protecting.


1132
0:39:38,167 --> 0:39:39,75
If you have a lot
of assets, if you're


1133
0:39:39,75 --> 0:39:41,83
someone who has a
really nice home, who


1134
0:39:41,83 --> 0:39:43,554
has money coming
from their family.


1135
0:39:43,554 --> 0:39:44,97
You want maybe
umbrella insurance.


1136
0:39:44,97 --> 0:39:47,6
You want to further
protect your assets.


1137
0:39:47,6 --> 0:39:50,48
Long term care, this is
a pretty fascinating one.


1138
0:39:50,48 --> 0:39:53,24
And because we are all living
longer, in your '30s and '40s,


1139
0:39:53,24 --> 0:39:55,482
you can buy long term
care pretty inexpensively.


1140
0:39:55,482 --> 0:39:57,44
And it all depends on
what your medical history


1141
0:39:57,44 --> 0:39:58,69
is, and things like that.


1142
0:39:58,69 --> 0:40:0,3
But like, my
grandmother, who I saw


1143
0:40:0,3 --> 0:40:3,45
last Sunday is 95 years old,
and she's like, kicking.


1144
0:40:3,45 --> 0:40:5,24
She is like, icy as hell.


1145
0:40:5,24 --> 0:40:7,23
And I'm like, oh my
god, she's going live


1146
0:40:7,23 --> 0:40:8,536
for like, 10 more years maybe.


1147
0:40:8,536 --> 0:40:10,66
And the home she lives in
is like really expensive.


1148
0:40:10,66 --> 0:40:12,42
It's like $90,000 a year.


1149
0:40:12,42 --> 0:40:15,157
And luckily, she was
able to afford that.


1150
0:40:15,157 --> 0:40:17,49
But I wouldn't be able to pay
for that if that happened.


1151
0:40:17,49 --> 0:40:19,198
And so one of the
things that's important


1152
0:40:19,198 --> 0:40:22,1
is, this is an insurance that
may make sense in your '30s


1153
0:40:22,1 --> 0:40:23,724
and '40s to potentially get.


1154
0:40:23,724 --> 0:40:25,64
And then we also walk
through these documents.


1155
0:40:25,64 --> 0:40:27,58
And I'll give you estate
planning documents,


1156
0:40:27,58 --> 0:40:28,979
as boring as they are.


1157
0:40:28,979 --> 0:40:30,52
You can go to
LegalZoom, you actually


1158
0:40:30,52 --> 0:40:32,32
get a discount through
LearnVest at LegalZoom.


1159
0:40:32,32 --> 0:40:32,903
Fill them out.


1160
0:40:32,903 --> 0:40:33,762
Takes a few minutes.


1161
0:40:33,762 --> 0:40:34,97
And I'll give you an example.


1162
0:40:34,97 --> 0:40:37,43
If you have a child, and you
don't have a Guardian letter,


1163
0:40:37,43 --> 0:40:39,596
those are the sort of things
that we call red flags.


1164
0:40:39,596 --> 0:40:41,77
And we would help you do first.


1165
0:40:41,77 --> 0:40:43,22
Because money doesn't matter.


1166
0:40:43,22 --> 0:40:44,64
But if, God forbid,
something happens to you


1167
0:40:44,64 --> 0:40:45,64
and you don't know
who's actually


1168
0:40:45,64 --> 0:40:47,48
become the legal
guardian of your child,


1169
0:40:47,48 --> 0:40:48,8
for me that's step one.


1170
0:40:48,8 --> 0:40:50,32
And so that's the sort
of stuff that our program


1171
0:40:50,32 --> 0:40:51,6
takes into account.


1172
0:40:51,6 --> 0:40:52,815
And what we do is we put
you through the filter,


1173
0:40:52,815 --> 0:40:54,356
and we figure out
all the things that


1174
0:40:54,356 --> 0:40:55,844
are critical that you must do.


1175
0:40:55,844 --> 0:40:58,26
And then we start talking about
the things you want to do.


1176
0:40:58,26 --> 0:40:59,43
Next.


1177
0:40:59,43 --> 0:41:1,38
And then finally,
step six is Maximize.


1178
0:41:1,38 --> 0:41:4,734
And so, really smart people,
and I mean really smart people,


1179
0:41:4,734 --> 0:41:7,15
come in the door of LearnVest
every day, and they're like,


1180
0:41:7,15 --> 0:41:8,38
I want to invest.


1181
0:41:8,38 --> 0:41:11,53
And we're like, yeah,
we'd love you to invest.


1182
0:41:11,53 --> 0:41:13,6
But let's first
make sure that you


1183
0:41:13,6 --> 0:41:14,893
have those pillars in
place, and that you're


1184
0:41:14,893 --> 0:41:16,35
protected from everything.


1185
0:41:16,35 --> 0:41:18,89
And if at the end of that,
you still have extra money,


1186
0:41:18,89 --> 0:41:20,754
then here's what we ask you.


1187
0:41:20,754 --> 0:41:22,17
So we'll look at
your 401Ks, we'll


1188
0:41:22,17 --> 0:41:24,27
make sure that you have the
appropriate asset allocation,


1189
0:41:24,27 --> 0:41:25,28
we'll make sure that
they're invested


1190
0:41:25,28 --> 0:41:26,75
in things that are inexpensive.


1191
0:41:26,75 --> 0:41:29,82
I'm going to assume that
you have a great 401K here.


1192
0:41:29,82 --> 0:41:31,252
But outside of that.


1193
0:41:31,252 --> 0:41:32,96
Let's say I have an
extra pocket of money


1194
0:41:32,96 --> 0:41:34,47
after getting through
all of those steps,


1195
0:41:34,47 --> 0:41:35,81
but my husband and I
are going to buy a house


1196
0:41:35,81 --> 0:41:37,78
in New York in the next
two or three years.


1197
0:41:37,78 --> 0:41:39,12
Money shouldn't be invested.


1198
0:41:39,12 --> 0:41:41,2
It should have zero
equity exposure.


1199
0:41:41,2 --> 0:41:42,79
And so we put you
through a few things.


1200
0:41:42,79 --> 0:41:43,94
One is the rule of five.


1201
0:41:43,94 --> 0:41:45,9
Do you need the money
in the next five years?


1202
0:41:45,9 --> 0:41:49,54
If it's money to go on a trip,
to go start a small business.


1203
0:41:49,54 --> 0:41:51,506
Just literally,
you want to have it


1204
0:41:51,506 --> 0:41:53,38
there because you're
having a baby in a year.


1205
0:41:53,38 --> 0:41:55,2
We're like, no, no,
you can't invest it.


1206
0:41:55,2 --> 0:41:56,45
So literally, rule of five.


1207
0:41:56,45 --> 0:41:58,75
If you need it in
five years, it should


1208
0:41:58,75 --> 0:42:0,24
have zero equity exposure.


1209
0:42:0,24 --> 0:42:1,5
The other thing is quick--


1210
0:42:1,5 --> 0:42:2,43
AUDIENCE: What's
equity exposure?


1211
0:42:2,43 --> 0:42:4,67
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So literally
it's any set of stocks.


1212
0:42:4,67 --> 0:42:7,12
It's ETFs that have
like an S&P 500,


1213
0:42:7,12 --> 0:42:8,82
it's anything where
the underlying


1214
0:42:8,82 --> 0:42:11,79
asset is portions of companies.


1215
0:42:11,79 --> 0:42:13,462
What we would
recommend, potentially


1216
0:42:13,462 --> 0:42:15,795
again, depending on who you
are and what your goals are,


1217
0:42:15,795 --> 0:42:19,6
is things like CD
ladders or bonds.


1218
0:42:19,6 --> 0:42:22,52
And long story short, another
important tip that maybe you'll


1219
0:42:22,52 --> 0:42:27,1
appreciate is, for
your 401K or your IRA,


1220
0:42:27,1 --> 0:42:29,56
which are both just investment
accounts for retirement,


1221
0:42:29,56 --> 0:42:30,88
most people can't maximize.


1222
0:42:30,88 --> 0:42:33,22
It's $23,000 a year
you can put away.


1223
0:42:33,22 --> 0:42:34,72
You should be doing
that, before you


1224
0:42:34,72 --> 0:42:36,24
should be doing anything else.


1225
0:42:36,24 --> 0:42:38,79
And what we look at is,
it's called the rule of 120.


1226
0:42:38,79 --> 0:42:40,36
You take 120 and
you minus your age.


1227
0:42:40,36 --> 0:42:41,73
So let's say I'm 30.


1228
0:42:41,73 --> 0:42:42,85
120 minus 30.


1229
0:42:42,85 --> 0:42:45,41
90% should have equity
exposure, because that's


1230
0:42:45,41 --> 0:42:46,5
where all the risk is.


1231
0:42:46,5 --> 0:42:50,2
And over the last century, the
average stock market return,


1232
0:42:50,2 --> 0:42:52,32
the average over
a century is 10%.


1233
0:42:52,32 --> 0:42:53,269
So that's great.


1234
0:42:53,269 --> 0:42:54,81
And in fact, you
need to be investing


1235
0:42:54,81 --> 0:42:58,364
to outlive that inflation,
which is 3% a year.


1236
0:42:58,364 --> 0:42:59,78
The takeaway here,
a lot of people


1237
0:42:59,78 --> 0:43:2,265
just quickly jump to conclusions
mat, and they're like,


1238
0:43:2,265 --> 0:43:3,279
I should be investing.


1239
0:43:3,279 --> 0:43:5,57
And the takeaway is, it's
really about these principles


1240
0:43:5,57 --> 0:43:9,26
to make sure that you're doing
it in the right thematic order.


1241
0:43:9,26 --> 0:43:12,86
And then step
seven is literally,


1242
0:43:12,86 --> 0:43:14,81
anytime your life
changes, we gotta


1243
0:43:14,81 --> 0:43:16,904
rerun every scenario for you.


1244
0:43:16,904 --> 0:43:18,32
And one thing I
will tell you guys


1245
0:43:18,32 --> 0:43:21,295
is, if you're doing
anything major,


1246
0:43:21,295 --> 0:43:23,47
if you're buying a home,
if you're having a child,


1247
0:43:23,47 --> 0:43:27,7
if you're changing majorly
jobs, moving across coasts.


1248
0:43:27,7 --> 0:43:30,4
If you're in a position where
someone in your family is sick.


1249
0:43:30,4 --> 0:43:32,36
You're going to
major life event,


1250
0:43:32,36 --> 0:43:34,18
take the time to
talk to an expert.


1251
0:43:34,18 --> 0:43:35,806
It is critical.


1252
0:43:35,806 --> 0:43:37,68
You don't know all the
things you don't know.


1253
0:43:37,68 --> 0:43:39,29
And it's not all Google-able.


1254
0:43:39,29 --> 0:43:41,9
You can't go and find them.


1255
0:43:41,9 --> 0:43:44,28
And the real big key here
is, before LearnVest existed,


1256
0:43:44,28 --> 0:43:47,0
it was thousands of dollars to
be able to talk to an expert.


1257
0:43:47,0 --> 0:43:48,91
But one thing that
we really say is,


1258
0:43:48,91 --> 0:43:51,95
these big things that
you're going through, I just


1259
0:43:51,95 --> 0:43:53,45
talked about
insurance, the riders


1260
0:43:53,45 --> 0:43:56,862
are like multiple, multiple
pages of fine print.


1261
0:43:56,862 --> 0:43:57,57
You're no lawyer.


1262
0:43:57,57 --> 0:43:59,53
Like you're not an
insurance expert.


1263
0:43:59,53 --> 0:44:2,9
It's worthwhile to make sure
that God forbid, Hurricane


1264
0:44:2,9 --> 0:44:5,44
Sandy or an earthquake
happens, you're protected.


1265
0:44:5,44 --> 0:44:7,8
And you guys can
absolutely all afford


1266
0:44:7,8 --> 0:44:9,18
to be able to talk to an expert.


1267
0:44:9,18 --> 0:44:10,13
And it's worthwhile.


1268
0:44:10,13 --> 0:44:13,266
And I'll just say, as part of
just the LearnVest program,


1269
0:44:13,266 --> 0:44:15,89
we actually worked with a bunch
of behavioral experts from MIT,


1270
0:44:15,89 --> 0:44:18,48
and some really serious
behavior scientists.


1271
0:44:18,48 --> 0:44:20,82
And figured out that a lot
of people learn this stuff,


1272
0:44:20,82 --> 0:44:24,114
and then it's overwhelming,
so they don't actually do it.


1273
0:44:24,114 --> 0:44:26,28
So one of the things that
we're doing, it's January.


1274
0:44:26,28 --> 0:44:30,49
90% of the country's financial
resolutions is do it.


1275
0:44:30,49 --> 0:44:33,791
And when I wrote the book,
if you go to the next slide.


1276
0:44:33,791 --> 0:44:36,29
So when I wrote the book, one
of the things that we did was,


1277
0:44:36,29 --> 0:44:38,82
we wanted to make not only
financial planning affordable,


1278
0:44:38,82 --> 0:44:40,8
but we wanted people
to actually do it.


1279
0:44:40,8 --> 0:44:43,5
So just 10 seconds on
how our company works,


1280
0:44:43,5 --> 0:44:46,74
because you guys obviously
are so attached to the web.


1281
0:44:46,74 --> 0:44:48,57
So it's literally
like a gym membership.


1282
0:44:48,57 --> 0:44:51,147
You pay an up front fee, you
get connected to an expert,


1283
0:44:51,147 --> 0:44:53,23
and then it's $19 a month,
and you can shut it off


1284
0:44:53,23 --> 0:44:54,51
at any time.


1285
0:44:54,51 --> 0:44:56,34
If you go to the next slide.


1286
0:44:56,34 --> 0:44:57,49
Here's what the process is.


1287
0:44:57,49 --> 0:45:0,5
You fill out an online profile,
and this asks you everything.


1288
0:45:0,5 --> 0:45:0,89
Where are you today?


1289
0:45:0,89 --> 0:45:1,952
Where do you want to go?


1290
0:45:1,952 --> 0:45:3,41
What would you like
to have happen?


1291
0:45:3,41 --> 0:45:5,31
What does financial
security mean for you?


1292
0:45:5,31 --> 0:45:7,4
What are the risks that
keep you up at night?


1293
0:45:7,4 --> 0:45:9,77
And we actually go
and build everything.


1294
0:45:9,77 --> 0:45:10,27
Next.


1295
0:45:10,27 --> 0:45:12,84
You get your own dedicated
financial planner


1296
0:45:12,84 --> 0:45:14,1
through LearnVest.


1297
0:45:14,1 --> 0:45:15,35
These are people on our staff.


1298
0:45:15,35 --> 0:45:18,1
They're CFPs, which
I just told, in order


1299
0:45:18,1 --> 0:45:19,99
to even be a CFP
you by nature have


1300
0:45:19,99 --> 0:45:21,82
to have about four
years of experience.


1301
0:45:21,82 --> 0:45:23,16
Most of ours have 10.


1302
0:45:23,16 --> 0:45:25,15
But you get the same
dedicated expert,


1303
0:45:25,15 --> 0:45:26,83
and they're on demand for you.


1304
0:45:26,83 --> 0:45:28,34
If you go to the next slide.


1305
0:45:28,34 --> 0:45:31,6
So this is literally what a
financial plan looks like.


1306
0:45:31,6 --> 0:45:33,3
We built our own software
because the stuff


1307
0:45:33,3 --> 0:45:35,94
that was out there
was pretty bad.


1308
0:45:35,94 --> 0:45:37,62
What it does is
literally, and you


1309
0:45:37,62 --> 0:45:39,869
can't see it necessarily
perfectly is, we literally


1310
0:45:39,869 --> 0:45:40,66
build you a budget.


1311
0:45:40,66 --> 0:45:43,1
Show you where every
single dollar should go.


1312
0:45:43,1 --> 0:45:44,502
We even then build a calendar.


1313
0:45:44,502 --> 0:45:46,21
And it shows you, so
go back to let's say


1314
0:45:46,21 --> 0:45:48,66
you have $2,000 at
the end of the month


1315
0:45:48,66 --> 0:45:50,395
that you can use
toward your goals.


1316
0:45:50,395 --> 0:45:52,52
We break it down month by
month, where it should go


1317
0:45:52,52 --> 0:45:54,29
and what it should look like.


1318
0:45:54,29 --> 0:45:56,0
And I think the
takeaway here is,


1319
0:45:56,0 --> 0:45:57,8
this is what a financial
plan looks like.


1320
0:45:57,8 --> 0:45:59,15
It is dollar per dollar.


1321
0:45:59,15 --> 0:46:0,84
And what I love about
financial planning


1322
0:46:0,84 --> 0:46:3,885
is, guys I come from
a family of doctors.


1323
0:46:3,885 --> 0:46:5,51
You know, when it
comes to cancer like,


1324
0:46:5,51 --> 0:46:7,801
it's really stressful because
we don't have the answer.


1325
0:46:7,801 --> 0:46:10,38
Like, we're working in labs
trying to figure it out.


1326
0:46:10,38 --> 0:46:12,6
Financial planning,
and why I believe


1327
0:46:12,6 --> 0:46:13,39
with all my heart
and soul, literally


1328
0:46:13,39 --> 0:46:15,5
should be accessible to
everyone in the country is,


1329
0:46:15,5 --> 0:46:16,32
it's just math.


1330
0:46:16,32 --> 0:46:17,74
It is not-- at the
end of the day, what's


1331
0:46:17,74 --> 0:46:19,83
complicated is the rules
and all the legislation.


1332
0:46:19,83 --> 0:46:21,4
But if you know what
someone's dollar amount is,


1333
0:46:21,4 --> 0:46:22,95
you can put it through a
system and you can tell them


1334
0:46:22,95 --> 0:46:24,594
exactly what they need to do.


1335
0:46:24,594 --> 0:46:26,26
And so anyways, we
build you a calendar.


1336
0:46:26,26 --> 0:46:29,6
And then the final thing is, we
literally give you unlimited,


1337
0:46:29,6 --> 0:46:31,5
if you go to the next
slide, we give you


1338
0:46:31,5 --> 0:46:32,99
unlimited phone
and email support.


1339
0:46:32,99 --> 0:46:34,8
Your expert's on demand for you.


1340
0:46:34,8 --> 0:46:36,39
Put them on your speed dial.


1341
0:46:36,39 --> 0:46:37,97
And you always get
the same person.


1342
0:46:37,97 --> 0:46:39,43
And so, this is
in a nutshell what


1343
0:46:39,43 --> 0:46:41,75
I've spent the last four
years of my life building.


1344
0:46:41,75 --> 0:46:44,21
If you go to the next slide.


1345
0:46:44,21 --> 0:46:46,32
Google got you guys
books, which is awesome.


1346
0:46:46,32 --> 0:46:48,982
In the book, everyone
gets a $50 credit


1347
0:46:48,982 --> 0:46:50,69
if you want to work
with your own expert.


1348
0:46:50,69 --> 0:46:52,106
And if anyone wants
to get a plan,


1349
0:46:52,106 --> 0:46:55,17
we just as a thank you
for having us here,


1350
0:46:55,17 --> 0:46:56,976
we'll give you an
extra month of service.


1351
0:46:56,976 --> 0:46:58,6
But I'm going to
stand up here, and I'm


1352
0:46:58,6 --> 0:46:59,961
going to answer any questions.


1353
0:46:59,961 --> 0:47:1,96
And the one thing I will
say that's so important


1354
0:47:1,96 --> 0:47:7,9
is, everyone can make progress.


1355
0:47:7,9 --> 0:47:9,569
I would gamble to say
that everyone in this room


1356
0:47:9,569 --> 0:47:11,61
is in a pretty good
situation, where you actually


1357
0:47:11,61 --> 0:47:12,94
have extra money at
the end of the month


1358
0:47:12,94 --> 0:47:14,41
that you can put towards goals.


1359
0:47:14,41 --> 0:47:17,33
So then it's a matter of making
sure that actually happens.


1360
0:47:17,33 --> 0:47:18,21
But anyways.


1361
0:47:18,21 --> 0:47:19,589
Most people are pretty stressed.


1362
0:47:19,589 --> 0:47:21,13
Lots of people have
questions, so I'm


1363
0:47:21,13 --> 0:47:22,857
going to stay as late
as I possibly can,


1364
0:47:22,857 --> 0:47:24,19
before I go to the other Google.


1365
0:47:24,19 --> 0:47:25,219
What's your question?


1366
0:47:25,219 --> 0:47:25,76
AUDIENCE: OK.


1367
0:47:25,76 --> 0:47:28,567
My question is something you
said about credit reports.


1368
0:47:28,567 --> 0:47:29,442
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.


1369
0:47:29,442 --> 0:47:29,884
AUDIENCE: Credit rating.


1370
0:47:29,884 --> 0:47:30,768
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.


1371
0:47:30,768 --> 0:47:32,94
AUDIENCE: And, I
want to make sure I


1372
0:47:32,94 --> 0:47:33,0
understood what you said, so--


1373
0:47:33,0 --> 0:47:33,63
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.


1374
0:47:33,63 --> 0:47:35,213
AUDIENCE: You said,
credit utilization


1375
0:47:35,213 --> 0:47:38,98
is based on a balance
held over a period.


1376
0:47:38,98 --> 0:47:42,514
So it wouldn't be the amount a
person used and then paid off.


1377
0:47:42,514 --> 0:47:44,43
That doesn't count towards
credit utilization?


1378
0:47:44,43 --> 0:47:45,22
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're
absolutely correct.


1379
0:47:45,22 --> 0:47:47,87
So let's just say, I actually
have an American Express credit


1380
0:47:47,87 --> 0:47:48,37
card.


1381
0:47:48,37 --> 0:47:50,83
Also you guys should call and
actually increase your credit


1382
0:47:50,83 --> 0:47:53,61
limits if you are able,
if you have good credit.


1383
0:47:53,61 --> 0:47:56,52
So I have an American Express
card with a $50,000 limit.


1384
0:47:56,52 --> 0:47:58,39
If I go buy a car on
it, which by the way


1385
0:47:58,39 --> 0:47:59,515
would give me great points.


1386
0:47:59,515 --> 0:48:2,18
My whole life is 1% on
sale, which is awesome.


1387
0:48:2,18 --> 0:48:4,68
And I pay it off in full
every month, no issue.


1388
0:48:4,68 --> 0:48:7,56
But American Express doesn't
let you carry a balance anyways.


1389
0:48:7,56 --> 0:48:10,68
But if you have three credit
cards, total limit of $10,000,


1390
0:48:10,68 --> 0:48:13,39
and you're carrying $10,000
of debt month over month,


1391
0:48:13,39 --> 0:48:14,92
that's when you
are in big trouble.


1392
0:48:14,92 --> 0:48:17,74
And the key there is, just pay
your credit card off in full.


1393
0:48:17,74 --> 0:48:18,66
And for those--


1394
0:48:18,66 --> 0:48:21,14
AUDIENCE: Every credit
report I actually got,


1395
0:48:21,14 --> 0:48:24,805
ever, told me that
my revolving balance


1396
0:48:24,805 --> 0:48:29,85
is negative [INAUDIBLE] let's
say $10,000 credit limit.


1397
0:48:29,85 --> 0:48:29,96
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.


1398
0:48:29,96 --> 0:48:32,6
AUDIENCE: My revolving
balance is like, $3,000,


1399
0:48:32,6 --> 0:48:35,73
but it's paid off every
month, the credit report still


1400
0:48:35,73 --> 0:48:39,184
said that's negative
on my credit report.


1401
0:48:39,184 --> 0:48:41,1
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Because
you're spending-- but


1402
0:48:41,1 --> 0:48:42,56
are you carrying
any of the debt?


1403
0:48:42,56 --> 0:48:43,26
AUDIENCE: No.


1404
0:48:43,26 --> 0:48:44,4
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
Month over month?


1405
0:48:44,4 --> 0:48:45,5
AUDIENCE: Nothing's
carried forward.


1406
0:48:45,5 --> 0:48:46,75
ALEXA VON TOBEL: I think you may
have a misunderstanding there.


1407
0:48:46,75 --> 0:48:48,77
Because if you pay it
off in full every month,


1408
0:48:48,77 --> 0:48:50,37
you're good to go.


1409
0:48:50,37 --> 0:48:51,51
So, that's the key.


1410
0:48:51,51 --> 0:48:53,496
And again, you can send
us your credit report,


1411
0:48:53,496 --> 0:48:55,87
and we'll actually walk you
through it if you want us to.


1412
0:48:55,87 --> 0:48:56,572
Step by step.


1413
0:48:56,572 --> 0:48:57,988
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
like, you're


1414
0:48:57,988 --> 0:48:59,852
using too much of your credit.


1415
0:48:59,852 --> 0:49:0,784
[INAUDIBLE]


1416
0:49:0,784 --> 0:49:2,3
AUDIENCE: Ask for more.


1417
0:49:2,3 --> 0:49:2,42
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


1418
0:49:2,42 --> 0:49:4,586
What I would do is, if you
have a good credit score,


1419
0:49:4,586 --> 0:49:5,4
first I'd call.


1420
0:49:5,4 --> 0:49:7,14
One of the reasons why we tell
you to increase your credit


1421
0:49:7,14 --> 0:49:9,265
limit, is it boosts your
credit score a little bit.


1422
0:49:9,265 --> 0:49:13,7
But also, if God forbid, like
shit totally hits the fan,


1423
0:49:13,7 --> 0:49:15,1
you are in a position
where you can go out


1424
0:49:15,1 --> 0:49:19,124
and access, God forbid something
really catastrophic happens.


1425
0:49:19,124 --> 0:49:21,29
We would never want you to
use credit, but is there.


1426
0:49:21,29 --> 0:49:24,44
And so it's one of the
things, and for example,


1427
0:49:24,44 --> 0:49:26,77
also when you get really
sophisticated with your money,


1428
0:49:26,77 --> 0:49:28,19
I have a $50,000 credit limit.


1429
0:49:28,19 --> 0:49:30,0
I could by a car, and
get points for it.


1430
0:49:30,0 --> 0:49:32,43
Which actually means
it's like 1% to 2% off.


1431
0:49:32,43 --> 0:49:34,35
That's the sort of
stuff that like really


1432
0:49:34,35 --> 0:49:36,61
is sort of maximizing
your finances.


1433
0:49:36,61 --> 0:49:37,11
Go ahead.


1434
0:49:37,11 --> 0:49:38,56
And-- Yeah.


1435
0:49:38,56 --> 0:49:39,64
FEMALE SPEAKER: If everybody
can come to the microphone.


1436
0:49:39,64 --> 0:49:40,82
It's just better
for the recording.


1437
0:49:40,82 --> 0:49:41,26
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Oh, perfect.


1438
0:49:41,26 --> 0:49:41,74
Sorry.


1439
0:49:41,74 --> 0:49:42,6
Everyone come to the microphone.


1440
0:49:42,6 --> 0:49:44,25
And guys, I love
these questions.


1441
0:49:44,25 --> 0:49:45,38
I get them nonstop.


1442
0:49:45,38 --> 0:49:47,3
And there's really, like
there's no such thing


1443
0:49:47,3 --> 0:49:48,454
as a dumb question.


1444
0:49:48,454 --> 0:49:50,37
AUDIENCE: My question,
you mentioned Mint.com,


1445
0:49:50,37 --> 0:49:52,73
which I've been using,
and it's been helpful.


1446
0:49:52,73 --> 0:49:54,14
But there are some bugs with it.


1447
0:49:54,14 --> 0:49:54,43
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


1448
0:49:54,43 --> 0:49:55,96
AUDIENCE: Like certain
accounts don't work at all.


1449
0:49:55,96 --> 0:49:58,21
And the biggest one for me
is our Google stock account


1450
0:49:58,21 --> 0:49:59,347
doesn't work with it.


1451
0:49:59,347 --> 0:50:1,68
So I'm just wondering if you
know if your software does,


1452
0:50:1,68 --> 0:50:4,15
and what the differences between
your software and Mint are?


1453
0:50:4,15 --> 0:50:4,9
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
So great question.


1454
0:50:4,9 --> 0:50:6,65
And I love you for asking that.


1455
0:50:6,65 --> 0:50:8,7
So first, our biggest--


1456
0:50:8,7 --> 0:50:9,63
AUDIENCE: Other reasons as well.


1457
0:50:9,63 --> 0:50:10,9
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


1458
0:50:10,9 --> 0:50:12,39
The first biggest
difference, and I


1459
0:50:12,39 --> 0:50:14,15
think Mint is a great tool
that you can see everything


1460
0:50:14,15 --> 0:50:14,7
in one place.


1461
0:50:14,7 --> 0:50:15,62
We don't recommend anything.


1462
0:50:15,62 --> 0:50:17,5
In fact, what I don't
like what Mint does,


1463
0:50:17,5 --> 0:50:19,299
is they do make all these
recommendations of products.


1464
0:50:19,299 --> 0:50:20,89
You opening extra
credit cards, not


1465
0:50:20,89 --> 0:50:22,389
good for your
finances at it's core.


1466
0:50:22,389 --> 0:50:24,82
Good for Mint, they'll get $150.


1467
0:50:24,82 --> 0:50:27,18
But the other thing is, so
we run no ads through it.


1468
0:50:27,18 --> 0:50:28,92
But the real key is,
if you're working


1469
0:50:28,92 --> 0:50:30,82
with one of our
experts, they can,


1470
0:50:30,82 --> 0:50:33,14
once you upgrade, and
work with a planner, boom.


1471
0:50:33,14 --> 0:50:35,57
They can see your entire
account right there.


1472
0:50:35,57 --> 0:50:36,81
They can set goals for you.


1473
0:50:36,81 --> 0:50:38,29
They can set budgets for you.


1474
0:50:38,29 --> 0:50:39,55
You don't have to
communicate anything.


1475
0:50:39,55 --> 0:50:41,61
You don't have to take the
time and energy to say,


1476
0:50:41,61 --> 0:50:42,59
here's all my paperwork.


1477
0:50:42,59 --> 0:50:43,548
Here's what's going on.


1478
0:50:43,548 --> 0:50:46,82
So the biggest real difference
is, the tool is free for us,


1479
0:50:46,82 --> 0:50:49,14
and it's just part of the app.


1480
0:50:49,14 --> 0:50:51,25
It's working with a
planner that actually


1481
0:50:51,25 --> 0:50:52,94
makes you change your finances.


1482
0:50:52,94 --> 0:50:55,5
So, that's the
biggest difference.


1483
0:50:55,5 --> 0:50:58,4
And for the Google stock, I
do not know the exact answer.


1484
0:50:58,4 --> 0:51:0,97
We'll get back to you as
soon as I possibly can.


1485
0:51:0,97 --> 0:51:1,51
Go ahead.


1486
0:51:1,51 --> 0:51:4,37
I wish I had Google
stock, that'd be awesome.


1487
0:51:4,37 --> 0:51:8,77
AUDIENCE: So beyond insurance
and financial investments,


1488
0:51:8,77 --> 0:51:11,49
retirement savings,
is there anything


1489
0:51:11,49 --> 0:51:17,335
you think most people don't
spend or consume enough?


1490
0:51:17,335 --> 0:51:19,46
ALEXA VON TOBEL: I mean I
really can tell you this.


1491
0:51:19,46 --> 0:51:21,579
I don't care what
your household looks


1492
0:51:21,579 --> 0:51:23,12
like, if you walk
in the door for us,


1493
0:51:23,12 --> 0:51:25,35
we find big blind spots.


1494
0:51:25,35 --> 0:51:27,61
Things that you
were like, whew, you


1495
0:51:27,61 --> 0:51:30,2
don't have like the right
level of auto insurance.


1496
0:51:30,2 --> 0:51:30,96
That's not good.


1497
0:51:30,96 --> 0:51:33,619
You drive like,
seven times a day.


1498
0:51:33,619 --> 0:51:35,66
So one of the things that
we find out, and again,


1499
0:51:35,66 --> 0:51:36,267
like step one.


1500
0:51:36,267 --> 0:51:36,85
Get organized.


1501
0:51:36,85 --> 0:51:37,551
Have less.


1502
0:51:37,551 --> 0:51:38,5
Follow it.


1503
0:51:38,5 --> 0:51:38,64
Track it.


1504
0:51:38,64 --> 0:51:40,64
I mean, you guys saw all
the crazy Target stuff.


1505
0:51:40,64 --> 0:51:44,31
Neiman Marcus got broken into
today, their credit cards.


1506
0:51:44,31 --> 0:51:45,14
Track it.


1507
0:51:45,14 --> 0:51:47,6
Because it behooves you-- sorry.


1508
0:51:47,6 --> 0:51:49,2
It behooves you in
every single way.


1509
0:51:49,2 --> 0:51:50,44
So we get you organized.


1510
0:51:50,44 --> 0:51:51,898
Then we make sure
that you actually


1511
0:51:51,898 --> 0:51:53,37
know what you can spare.


1512
0:51:53,37 --> 0:51:55,43
And a lot of people
don't spare as much


1513
0:51:55,43 --> 0:51:58,515
as-- if you're making $10,000
a month, your household,


1514
0:51:58,515 --> 0:52:0,551
we're like, save $3,000.


1515
0:52:0,551 --> 0:52:1,5
Come on.


1516
0:52:1,5 --> 0:52:2,28
Like, let's do it.


1517
0:52:2,28 --> 0:52:4,33
And then we can start
working towards your goals.


1518
0:52:4,33 --> 0:52:7,216
And I think, to
answer your question,


1519
0:52:7,216 --> 0:52:8,715
those goals include
things like, you


1520
0:52:8,715 --> 0:52:10,74
need to be able to pay
premiums on insurance.


1521
0:52:10,74 --> 0:52:14,8
Because that's actually step one
of protecting your household.


1522
0:52:14,8 --> 0:52:16,32
So most people do not
have the right insurance.


1523
0:52:16,32 --> 0:52:18,495
They don have the right
legal documents in place.


1524
0:52:18,495 --> 0:52:19,87
And it sounds
really complicated,


1525
0:52:19,87 --> 0:52:21,7
but what's great
about our experts,


1526
0:52:21,7 --> 0:52:22,36
they just tell you to do.


1527
0:52:22,36 --> 0:52:23,16
They're like, shh.


1528
0:52:23,16 --> 0:52:24,15
Here's what you need.


1529
0:52:24,15 --> 0:52:25,11
We don't sell anything.


1530
0:52:25,11 --> 0:52:27,18
So we're totally
aligned with you.


1531
0:52:27,18 --> 0:52:29,72
And then, go talk to these
three providers and go.


1532
0:52:29,72 --> 0:52:31,655
Now you're armed in
a position to get it.


1533
0:52:31,655 --> 0:52:33,3
So that's the
biggest thing, is I


1534
0:52:33,3 --> 0:52:35,276
think most people
aren't saving enough,


1535
0:52:35,276 --> 0:52:37,65
and then they just don't know
what their blind spots are,


1536
0:52:37,65 --> 0:52:38,45
necessarily.


1537
0:52:38,45 --> 0:52:42,46
And they're often not paying
what they need to on insurance.


1538
0:52:42,46 --> 0:52:43,2
Go ahead.


1539
0:52:43,2 --> 0:52:44,83
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned not closing


1540
0:52:44,83 --> 0:52:46,18
you're oldest credit card.


1541
0:52:46,18 --> 0:52:47,55
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.


1542
0:52:47,55 --> 0:52:48,369
AUDIENCE: Is that per provider?


1543
0:52:48,369 --> 0:52:50,41
I'm in the position where
I just actually changed


1544
0:52:50,41 --> 0:52:52,9
Bank of America cards to
a to a rewards version.


1545
0:52:52,9 --> 0:52:55,37
If I close the old one and
start using the old one instead,


1546
0:52:55,37 --> 0:52:57,23
is that going to
create a discontinuity?


1547
0:52:57,23 --> 0:52:57,9
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Potentially.


1548
0:52:57,9 --> 0:52:59,608
So one of the things
that you should know


1549
0:52:59,608 --> 0:53:4,27
is, I had like a card when I was
16, 17, that my mom had opened.


1550
0:53:4,27 --> 0:53:6,469
And I had like a
junior card on hers.


1551
0:53:6,469 --> 0:53:8,1
First that wasn't
building my credit,


1552
0:53:8,1 --> 0:53:10,19
but that was my oldest
line of history.


1553
0:53:10,19 --> 0:53:12,54
I then have another
line of credit--


1554
0:53:12,54 --> 0:53:15,39
I had my own credit card that
I opened when I was like 21.


1555
0:53:15,39 --> 0:53:17,16
So oldest credit card.


1556
0:53:17,16 --> 0:53:19,55
I then said hey, I'd
like to change that card


1557
0:53:19,55 --> 0:53:21,84
to better card that would
suit my needs today.


1558
0:53:21,84 --> 0:53:23,57
And they were like,
if you close it,


1559
0:53:23,57 --> 0:53:25,19
that ends that line of credit.


1560
0:53:25,19 --> 0:53:27,18
And so the takeaway
there is, sometimes


1561
0:53:27,18 --> 0:53:29,16
it does make sense to
keep a credit card that's


1562
0:53:29,16 --> 0:53:31,1
not like your
favorite, because it


1563
0:53:31,1 --> 0:53:33,77
is you're oldest line of
credit, and to get another card.


1564
0:53:33,77 --> 0:53:36,1
And so like I'll give you a
sense of some of the cards


1565
0:53:36,1 --> 0:53:36,79
that we like.


1566
0:53:36,79 --> 0:53:40,585
So one in general, free American
Express cards are great.


1567
0:53:40,585 --> 0:53:41,96
You get points,
and they actually


1568
0:53:41,96 --> 0:53:43,29
make you pay them off
in full every month.


1569
0:53:43,29 --> 0:53:44,12
So I like that.


1570
0:53:44,12 --> 0:53:47,1
You're not able to
carry debt there.


1571
0:53:47,1 --> 0:53:49,35
Chase has a great
freedom rewards card


1572
0:53:49,35 --> 0:53:51,61
for people who like, spend
a lot on groceries and gas.


1573
0:53:51,61 --> 0:53:54,3
So when you're outside
of New York City,


1574
0:53:54,3 --> 0:53:55,73
and you're driving a ton.


1575
0:53:55,73 --> 0:53:56,3
Great.


1576
0:53:56,3 --> 0:53:57,82
5% back.


1577
0:53:57,82 --> 0:53:59,69
So I would say go
open another card


1578
0:53:59,69 --> 0:54:1,16
and use it and
just keep it open.


1579
0:54:1,16 --> 0:54:2,368
Because there's not any risk.


1580
0:54:2,368 --> 0:54:4,824
If you have just a few credit
cards and you monitor them.


1581
0:54:4,824 --> 0:54:7,24
What I don't like are like,
they Ann Taylor cards, the Gap


1582
0:54:7,24 --> 0:54:7,89
cards.


1583
0:54:7,89 --> 0:54:10,18
All that BS, which actually,
it's a funny story.


1584
0:54:10,18 --> 0:54:13,5
Over the holidays, I was
buying a $17 shirt at the Gap,


1585
0:54:13,5 --> 0:54:14,79
like a work out t-shirt.


1586
0:54:14,79 --> 0:54:17,29
And they were like, would you
like to open a line of credit?


1587
0:54:17,29 --> 0:54:18,27
You'll save $4 today.


1588
0:54:18,27 --> 0:54:19,77
And I almost punched
the poor woman.


1589
0:54:19,77 --> 0:54:22,61
I was like, you're talking
to the wrong girl right now.


1590
0:54:22,61 --> 0:54:22,98
[LAUGHTER]


1591
0:54:22,98 --> 0:54:23,58
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
But the takeaway


1592
0:54:23,58 --> 0:54:26,38
there is, those are the cards
that don't even have on-- you


1593
0:54:26,38 --> 0:54:28,5
can't log into some of them.


1594
0:54:28,5 --> 0:54:32,6
The national average on a
credit card is 17% negative APR.


1595
0:54:32,6 --> 0:54:34,63
On those cards,
it's often like 30%.


1596
0:54:34,63 --> 0:54:36,65
So that compounds
daily, by the way.


1597
0:54:36,65 --> 0:54:39,0
The best savings account in
the country is 1% right now.


1598
0:54:39,0 --> 0:54:39,976
So, they're horrible.


1599
0:54:39,976 --> 0:54:42,35
So the takeaway, I would say,
leave your oldest one open,


1600
0:54:42,35 --> 0:54:44,15
and then go get another credit
card that you really like.


1601
0:54:44,15 --> 0:54:44,555
AUDIENCE: All right.


1602
0:54:44,555 --> 0:54:44,96
Thank You.


1603
0:54:44,96 --> 0:54:45,37
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.


1604
0:54:45,37 --> 0:54:47,36
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
create a statement


1605
0:54:47,36 --> 0:54:48,27
if your balance is not zero.


1606
0:54:48,27 --> 0:54:50,548
So there's no statement
that shows that you paid.


1607
0:54:50,548 --> 0:54:51,454
[INAUDIBLE].


1608
0:54:51,454 --> 0:54:52,37
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


1609
0:54:52,37 --> 0:54:53,6
I mean.


1610
0:54:53,6 --> 0:54:53,63
It's nuts.


1611
0:54:53,63 --> 0:54:54,13
Go ahead.


1612
0:54:54,13 --> 0:54:55,546
AUDIENCE: So I
have two questions.


1613
0:54:55,546 --> 0:54:58,25
The first is, what about opening
checking and savings accounts?


1614
0:54:58,25 --> 0:54:59,724
Do those affect
your credit score?


1615
0:54:59,724 --> 0:55:0,89
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Not at all.


1616
0:55:0,89 --> 0:55:2,949
A checking account, a
debit card is not credit.


1617
0:55:2,949 --> 0:55:4,99
So that's one thing that's
really important guys.


1618
0:55:4,99 --> 0:55:7,574
Debit, credit, like
black and white.


1619
0:55:7,574 --> 0:55:9,49
And then opening things
like savings accounts,


1620
0:55:9,49 --> 0:55:10,384
that's totally fine.


1621
0:55:10,384 --> 0:55:11,8
One of things that
I don't like is


1622
0:55:11,8 --> 0:55:14,9
when you have a mutual fund
at this old brick and mortar


1623
0:55:14,9 --> 0:55:16,69
store that you like
aren't tracking,


1624
0:55:16,69 --> 0:55:19,35
and don't even know if like--
one of the reasons why we like


1625
0:55:19,35 --> 0:55:20,86
people to really
consolidate is, we


1626
0:55:20,86 --> 0:55:22,825
need to look at-- so I'm
just going to make this up.


1627
0:55:22,825 --> 0:55:24,306
Let's say I have
a million dollars,


1628
0:55:24,306 --> 0:55:26,31
across like my cash
and my investments.


1629
0:55:26,31 --> 0:55:28,51
We have to look at your
portfolio as a whole.


1630
0:55:28,51 --> 0:55:31,276
Is everything properly allocated
based on what your goals are?


1631
0:55:31,276 --> 0:55:32,9
And when you have a
little bit of money


1632
0:55:32,9 --> 0:55:34,358
there, a little
bit of money there,


1633
0:55:34,358 --> 0:55:36,66
a little bit of money here,
you can't track it all.


1634
0:55:36,66 --> 0:55:38,909
It's much harder to look
at it as the full picture.


1635
0:55:38,909 --> 0:55:39,45
AUDIENCE: OK.


1636
0:55:39,45 --> 0:55:43,43
And so you recommended calling
our credit card companies


1637
0:55:43,43 --> 0:55:45,58
and asking them to increase
your line of credit.


1638
0:55:45,58 --> 0:55:47,33
So last time I did
that on my credit card,


1639
0:55:47,33 --> 0:55:49,92
they asked me for a reason.


1640
0:55:49,92 --> 0:55:51,3
What is the reason that you
recommended getting that.


1641
0:55:51,3 --> 0:55:51,46
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


1642
0:55:51,46 --> 0:55:52,84
So, there's scripts
like this in the book,


1643
0:55:52,84 --> 0:55:55,381
if you have credit card debt,
exactly how you can potentially


1644
0:55:55,381 --> 0:55:56,16
negotiate it down.


1645
0:55:56,16 --> 0:55:57,82
You may not always win.


1646
0:55:57,82 --> 0:56:1,9
But you can say, I've just
been a really healthy customer.


1647
0:56:1,9 --> 0:56:3,75
As you can see, I
pay my debt in full,


1648
0:56:3,75 --> 0:56:7,3
and I ultimately want to be
able to use this card more.


1649
0:56:7,3 --> 0:56:8,35
That's what they want to hear.


1650
0:56:8,35 --> 0:56:9,65
That's how they make money.


1651
0:56:9,65 --> 0:56:11,6
So you're like, I just want to
be able to use this card more.


1652
0:56:11,6 --> 0:56:12,471
It's my favorite credit card.


1653
0:56:12,471 --> 0:56:13,987
Boom, you're done.


1654
0:56:13,987 --> 0:56:14,82
AUDIENCE: Thank you.


1655
0:56:14,82 --> 0:56:16,403
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
They're like, please,


1656
0:56:16,403 --> 0:56:19,539
thank you for spending
on my credit card.


1657
0:56:19,539 --> 0:56:21,8
AUDIENCE: Are your
financial planners


1658
0:56:21,8 --> 0:56:23,6
able to work with you if you
have accounts internationally,


1659
0:56:23,6 --> 0:56:24,35
in addition to US?


1660
0:56:24,35 --> 0:56:26,48
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So,
it's pretty fun for us


1661
0:56:26,48 --> 0:56:28,55
how many people are
like can you help us.


1662
0:56:28,55 --> 0:56:30,34
So, one of the
things, it depends


1663
0:56:30,34 --> 0:56:32,34
exactly what the situation is.


1664
0:56:32,34 --> 0:56:34,45
And I can spend a lot more
time to like ask you in detail,


1665
0:56:34,45 --> 0:56:37,66
but the takeaway is, if you have
accounts in other countries,


1666
0:56:37,66 --> 0:56:39,13
we can help you
think that through.


1667
0:56:39,13 --> 0:56:40,99
But if you were like
a Canadian citizen,


1668
0:56:40,99 --> 0:56:44,399
and everything is there, and you
happen to just be living here,


1669
0:56:44,399 --> 0:56:45,69
we're not going to be the best.


1670
0:56:45,69 --> 0:56:47,18
Because you're
going to be dealing


1671
0:56:47,18 --> 0:56:49,69
with like 401Ks in Canada that
are actually very different.


1672
0:56:49,69 --> 0:56:51,316
They're called like
RBSs, or something.


1673
0:56:51,316 --> 0:56:53,273
But the takeaway is, if
you have a few accounts


1674
0:56:53,273 --> 0:56:55,182
abroad, we can help
you think it through.


1675
0:56:55,182 --> 0:56:57,39
But if you are living full
time in the United States,


1676
0:56:57,39 --> 0:57:0,886
and like going to stay
here for a long time.


1677
0:57:0,886 --> 0:57:3,135
And I want to go abroad as
quickly as we possibly can,


1678
0:57:3,135 --> 0:57:6,51
I'm just dealing with customers
coming in every minute right


1679
0:57:6,51 --> 0:57:7,331
now in the US.


1680
0:57:7,331 --> 0:57:7,83
Go ahead.


1681
0:57:7,83 --> 0:57:8,38
AUDIENCE: All right.


1682
0:57:8,38 --> 0:57:10,296
I was wondering can you
make mortgage payments


1683
0:57:10,296 --> 0:57:12,7
on like credit cards
and get points back?


1684
0:57:12,7 --> 0:57:14,7
ALEXA VON TOBEL: That's
a really great question.


1685
0:57:14,7 --> 0:57:15,75
So a few things.


1686
0:57:15,75 --> 0:57:17,1
It depends.


1687
0:57:17,1 --> 0:57:19,54
The most likely answer
is absolutely not.


1688
0:57:19,54 --> 0:57:21,2
But one thing that
is really helpful


1689
0:57:21,2 --> 0:57:23,44
is, if you want to
be in a position


1690
0:57:23,44 --> 0:57:25,77
where you are just
like hacking your life,


1691
0:57:25,77 --> 0:57:27,87
you can make your mortgage
payments twice a month,


1692
0:57:27,87 --> 0:57:28,87
instead of once a month.


1693
0:57:28,87 --> 0:57:31,328
Where you make an extra payment
throughout the entire year.


1694
0:57:31,328 --> 0:57:33,73
So instead of 12 payments
you can make 13 payments.


1695
0:57:33,73 --> 0:57:35,14
Is what it adds up to.


1696
0:57:35,14 --> 0:57:37,18
And so that's one of the
best things we help you do.


1697
0:57:37,18 --> 0:57:39,18
Because also that
interest compounds daily.


1698
0:57:39,18 --> 0:57:42,4
So what it not only does is
force you just to budget better


1699
0:57:42,4 --> 0:57:44,48
and actually make an extra
payment, but over time,


1700
0:57:44,48 --> 0:57:45,82
we like, and it's in the book.


1701
0:57:45,82 --> 0:57:47,986
We like, run a scenario for
you of like how much you


1702
0:57:47,986 --> 0:57:50,23
can save on interest
simply just by doing that.


1703
0:57:50,23 --> 0:57:51,947
So that would be a smarter tip.


1704
0:57:51,947 --> 0:57:52,78
AUDIENCE: Thank you.


1705
0:57:52,78 --> 0:57:55,72
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.


1706
0:57:55,72 --> 0:57:57,7
AUDIENCE: So, one
thing that I think


1707
0:57:57,7 --> 0:58:2,51
that when I've looked
at what CFPs can provide


1708
0:58:2,51 --> 0:58:4,37
for me, or for
people in general,


1709
0:58:4,37 --> 0:58:6,604
it's like a lot of
when you've got money


1710
0:58:6,604 --> 0:58:8,52
that you need to put in
different pots, that's


1711
0:58:8,52 --> 0:58:9,1
one thing.


1712
0:58:9,1 --> 0:58:13,3
But like, if you have like
a question about should I


1713
0:58:13,3 --> 0:58:15,7
become a landlord?


1714
0:58:15,7 --> 0:58:16,872
That's a harder
question to answer,


1715
0:58:16,872 --> 0:58:19,33
and I'm wondering how do you
deal with something like that?


1716
0:58:19,33 --> 0:58:22,544
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So actually, I
mean that's like a pretty not--


1717
0:58:22,544 --> 0:58:24,46
that's a pretty standard
question that we get.


1718
0:58:24,46 --> 0:58:25,76
For a few reasons.


1719
0:58:25,76 --> 0:58:29,5
Actually, what's amazing
about the financial system


1720
0:58:29,5 --> 0:58:31,3
in the United States is,
once you get really organized


1721
0:58:31,3 --> 0:58:32,674
and start getting
pretty healthy,


1722
0:58:32,674 --> 0:58:34,44
there's so much awesome
stuff you can do.


1723
0:58:34,44 --> 0:58:36,624
So then we're like,
second properties,


1724
0:58:36,624 --> 0:58:39,4
where you can become a landlord,
and all the tax benefits.


1725
0:58:39,4 --> 0:58:41,651
And there's like tax shelters
that are really complex,


1726
0:58:41,651 --> 0:58:43,9
but if you are in a position
where you can potentially


1727
0:58:43,9 --> 0:58:45,31
become a landlord,
we could show you


1728
0:58:45,31 --> 0:58:46,768
exactly what the
benefits would be.


1729
0:58:46,768 --> 0:58:48,75
So that's a pretty standard
question, actually.


1730
0:58:48,75 --> 0:58:50,96
We have a lot of customers
who are landlords, or who


1731
0:58:50,96 --> 0:58:53,68
have rental properties, that
have been beneficial tax


1732
0:58:53,68 --> 0:58:54,742
benefits.


1733
0:58:54,742 --> 0:58:56,2
And then, if you
have kids, there's


1734
0:58:56,2 --> 0:58:58,584
so much cool stuff
that you can do.


1735
0:58:58,584 --> 0:59:0,0
I'll give you a
10 second example.


1736
0:59:0,0 --> 0:59:3,4
Your parents can actually tax
free, pay for their educations.


1737
0:59:3,4 --> 0:59:5,63
Move money to your
children's accounts.


1738
0:59:5,63 --> 0:59:7,28
You can overfund
your first 529 plan


1739
0:59:7,28 --> 0:59:8,3
so that your second
kids are going


1740
0:59:8,3 --> 0:59:9,599
to be better taken care of.


1741
0:59:9,599 --> 0:59:11,89
I mean, there's so much stuff
once you're in a position


1742
0:59:11,89 --> 0:59:12,94
where you have extra money.


1743
0:59:12,94 --> 0:59:14,648
So in fact, I should
have said, you know,


1744
0:59:14,648 --> 0:59:17,51
our average customer's household
individual incomes are actually


1745
0:59:17,51 --> 0:59:19,95
above $75,000 to $100,000,
and household incomes


1746
0:59:19,95 --> 0:59:21,94
are in the $200,000
to $300,000 range.


1747
0:59:21,94 --> 0:59:26,7
Those customers come in, and
we can do so much for them.


1748
0:59:26,7 --> 0:59:27,69
But we also sign
up 23-year-olds who


1749
0:59:27,69 --> 0:59:29,23
are like, I'm just
getting started.


1750
0:59:29,23 --> 0:59:31,164
And we're like,
yes, get started.


1751
0:59:31,164 --> 0:59:32,58
Because then you'll
be in position


1752
0:59:32,58 --> 0:59:34,455
to be able to have more
money for the future.


1753
0:59:34,455 --> 0:59:35,956
So when you have
healthier finances,


1754
0:59:35,956 --> 0:59:37,288
there's so much more you can do.


1755
0:59:37,288 --> 0:59:38,95
And yes, we answer
that question a lot.


1756
0:59:38,95 --> 0:59:39,658
AUDIENCE: Thanks.


1757
0:59:39,658 --> 0:59:41,34
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.


1758
0:59:41,34 --> 0:59:42,61
AUDIENCE: Two questions.


1759
0:59:42,61 --> 0:59:45,61
One is the, one of the
frustrating things about,


1760
0:59:45,61 --> 0:59:49,19
about online-- about
the packages that


1761
0:59:49,19 --> 0:59:53,13
pull your online accounts
is that there's always


1762
0:59:53,13 --> 0:59:56,262
this account where you can't
really pull the information.


1763
0:59:56,262 --> 0:59:57,72
So do you have some
kind of system?


1764
0:59:57,72 --> 0:59:59,97
I just put it into a
spreadsheet and upload it, or?


1765
0:59:59,97 --> 1:0:0,42
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


1766
1:0:0,42 --> 1:0:0,92
Even better.


1767
1:0:0,92 --> 1:0:2,52
We just let you add
a manual account


1768
1:0:2,52 --> 1:0:4,255
so you can add
any-- first of all,


1769
1:0:4,255 --> 1:0:6,75
you can link to LearnVest
literally everything.


1770
1:0:6,75 --> 1:0:11,287
Debt, student debt, mortgages,
credit cards, small businesses.


1771
1:0:11,287 --> 1:0:13,37
You could actually link
your entire small business


1772
1:0:13,37 --> 1:0:14,89
into LearnVest and have
your own small business


1773
1:0:14,89 --> 1:0:16,7
if you're a small
business owner.


1774
1:0:16,7 --> 1:0:19,69
You can add assets
like jewelry, cars,


1775
1:0:19,69 --> 1:0:22,19
literally like solid assets.


1776
1:0:22,19 --> 1:0:23,75
You can add things
like annuities.


1777
1:0:23,75 --> 1:0:24,95
You can pull those through.


1778
1:0:24,95 --> 1:0:26,408
And then, if anything
doesn't link,


1779
1:0:26,408 --> 1:0:28,18
so some people
have credit unions.


1780
1:0:28,18 --> 1:0:30,3
And they're like these
tiny little very like--


1781
1:0:30,3 --> 1:0:32,675
and one of the things is,
we'll look at your credit union


1782
1:0:32,675 --> 1:0:34,51
and be like, is it
worth you keeping it?


1783
1:0:34,51 --> 1:0:36,19
Are the benefits so strong?


1784
1:0:36,19 --> 1:0:38,31
And if you can't link it,
you can add a manual account.


1785
1:0:38,31 --> 1:0:40,18
And your planner just
helps you do that.


1786
1:0:40,18 --> 1:0:42,21
But also, the planner helps
you evaluate whether or not


1787
1:0:42,21 --> 1:0:43,39
you should keep those accounts.


1788
1:0:43,39 --> 1:0:44,765
AUDIENCE: And the
second question


1789
1:0:44,765 --> 1:0:45,95
has to do with privacy.


1790
1:0:45,95 --> 1:0:50,391
I mean, if I join, I'm going to
like, everything is open to you


1791
1:0:50,391 --> 1:0:50,89
guys.


1792
1:0:50,89 --> 1:0:51,72
How do you deal with that?


1793
1:0:51,72 --> 1:0:53,678
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So, 10
seconds on that answer.


1794
1:0:53,678 --> 1:0:55,595
So number one, it's
actually just a mirror in.


1795
1:0:55,595 --> 1:0:57,178
I think you guys as
like technologists


1796
1:0:57,178 --> 1:0:58,6
will appreciate this.


1797
1:0:58,6 --> 1:0:59,54
You can't move a dollar.


1798
1:0:59,54 --> 1:1:2,11
It is a mirror into what's
happening with your finances.


1799
1:1:2,11 --> 1:1:4,86
So first, there's
no account numbers,


1800
1:1:4,86 --> 1:1:8,92
it's just a window into what's
happening with the money.


1801
1:1:8,92 --> 1:1:12,48
So you can't accidentally
have it hacked and move money,


1802
1:1:12,48 --> 1:1:13,429
you're not at risk.


1803
1:1:13,429 --> 1:1:15,47
There's no account numbers
or anything like that.


1804
1:1:15,47 --> 1:1:17,344
Second, were a registered
investment adviser.


1805
1:1:17,344 --> 1:1:18,76
We report to the SEC.


1806
1:1:18,76 --> 1:1:22,24
So, we go through
compliance both technical,


1807
1:1:22,24 --> 1:1:24,49
literally running all of
our technical compliance,


1808
1:1:24,49 --> 1:1:28,85
but also internal compliance,
every literal month.


1809
1:1:28,85 --> 1:1:31,76
But the takeaway here is,
deeply safe and secure.


1810
1:1:31,76 --> 1:1:35,18
Also just one of our
very recent investments


1811
1:1:35,18 --> 1:1:37,912
was places like American
Express Ventures invested,


1812
1:1:37,912 --> 1:1:39,37
because American
Express eventually


1813
1:1:39,37 --> 1:1:41,3
is going start offering
LearnVest with their credit


1814
1:1:41,3 --> 1:1:41,89
cards.


1815
1:1:41,89 --> 1:1:43,82
As a bene-- not a benefit
that they pay for,


1816
1:1:43,82 --> 1:1:47,19
but as a way to help improve
their customer's well being.


1817
1:1:47,19 --> 1:1:50,8
So we have to go through
all their technical scrutiny


1818
1:1:50,8 --> 1:1:50,7
as well.


1819
1:1:50,7 --> 1:1:51,89
So, yes, yes, yes.


1820
1:1:51,89 --> 1:1:52,723
AUDIENCE: Thank you.


1821
1:1:52,723 --> 1:1:55,9



1822
1:1:55,9 --> 1:1:57,6
AUDIENCE: Two questions.


1823
1:1:57,6 --> 1:2:0,827
I recently reread "The
Millionaires Next Door".


1824
1:2:0,827 --> 1:2:1,66
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep


1825
1:2:1,66 --> 1:2:3,16
AUDIENCE: And one of the
things that they mentioned--


1826
1:2:3,16 --> 1:2:4,451
ALEXA VON TOBEL: I loved those.


1827
1:2:4,451 --> 1:2:8,28
AUDIENCE: Is that people who are
wealthier or good accumulators


1828
1:2:8,28 --> 1:2:10,66
of wealth actually
spend about eight hours


1829
1:2:10,66 --> 1:2:15,22
a month managing their money.


1830
1:2:15,22 --> 1:2:16,78
Do you have like
a recommendation


1831
1:2:16,78 --> 1:2:19,6
for how much time we
should be spending a month,


1832
1:2:19,6 --> 1:2:22,99
and also, do you see
that prolong over time,


1833
1:2:22,99 --> 1:2:24,915
or once you have like,
hopefully, you know,


1834
1:2:24,915 --> 1:2:27,29
I would love to get the point
where everything is set up.


1835
1:2:27,29 --> 1:2:28,206
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


1836
1:2:28,206 --> 1:2:30,165
AUDIENCE: Like do you
see that time decreasing?


1837
1:2:30,165 --> 1:2:31,8
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


1838
1:2:31,8 --> 1:2:31,89
So a few things.


1839
1:2:31,89 --> 1:2:34,2
What I just described
for you, And again,


1840
1:2:34,2 --> 1:2:37,49
like I could have sat here for
five more hours, to be honest,


1841
1:2:37,49 --> 1:2:38,97
was a system.


1842
1:2:38,97 --> 1:2:43,5
The program that we built is a
system, that literally hacks.


1843
1:2:43,5 --> 1:2:45,96
You saw, as I was
describing it, like we


1844
1:2:45,96 --> 1:2:49,1
make you do the 50,
20,30, because that 20%


1845
1:2:49,1 --> 1:2:50,83
should be going into
your retirement,


1846
1:2:50,83 --> 1:2:52,45
and we should get
that automated.


1847
1:2:52,45 --> 1:2:54,36
So what we create
is a foundation


1848
1:2:54,36 --> 1:2:56,58
that runs a system
that automates it,


1849
1:2:56,58 --> 1:2:57,59
so that it runs through.


1850
1:2:57,59 --> 1:2:59,37
I also then told
you about habits.


1851
1:2:59,37 --> 1:3:1,23
And actually, the last
chapter of the book


1852
1:3:1,23 --> 1:3:3,28
is about protecting
yourself from yourself.


1853
1:3:3,28 --> 1:3:5,57
Because we all have
pretty bad habits.


1854
1:3:5,57 --> 1:3:8,19
We actually asked our users to
confess, and on Good Morning


1855
1:3:8,19 --> 1:3:11,34
America tomorrow I'm
sharing some confessions


1856
1:3:11,34 --> 1:3:13,39
from some of their users.


1857
1:3:13,39 --> 1:3:16,23
Good Morning America
had them call in.


1858
1:3:16,23 --> 1:3:18,55
So one, we teach you
really good habits.


1859
1:3:18,55 --> 1:3:19,59
I log in, as I said.


1860
1:3:19,59 --> 1:3:21,72
To my LearnVest account
once a day, for a minute,


1861
1:3:21,72 --> 1:3:23,82
just to see and track
and see what's going on.


1862
1:3:23,82 --> 1:3:25,1
But I do spend.


1863
1:3:25,1 --> 1:3:27,6
January, I sit down
and we go through


1864
1:3:27,6 --> 1:3:29,242
and really make sure we
have a complete plan.


1865
1:3:29,242 --> 1:3:31,2
And guys, it's like
anything else in your life.


1866
1:3:31,2 --> 1:3:33,34
If you have a plan,
you will do more.


1867
1:3:33,34 --> 1:3:36,46
If your goals are set, which we
actually write your goals down


1868
1:3:36,46 --> 1:3:39,5
in the LearnVest platform,
so they're there.


1869
1:3:39,5 --> 1:3:41,6
And then you can expert
that checks in with you.


1870
1:3:41,6 --> 1:3:42,55
And then you get
awesome benefits


1871
1:3:42,55 --> 1:3:44,216
that are like little
surprises, once you


1872
1:3:44,216 --> 1:3:45,96
start achieving them from us.


1873
1:3:45,96 --> 1:3:47,965
And the takeaway there
is, writing things down,


1874
1:3:47,965 --> 1:3:49,34
having some hold
you accountable.


1875
1:3:49,34 --> 1:3:51,705
That's how you end up
really making progress.


1876
1:3:51,705 --> 1:3:53,83
And so it's not eight-- I
think eight hours a month


1877
1:3:53,83 --> 1:3:55,48
is a lot, to be honest.


1878
1:3:55,48 --> 1:3:58,684
As an expert who like is a
total geek for this stuff,


1879
1:3:58,684 --> 1:4:0,1
I don't spend eight
hours a month.


1880
1:4:0,1 --> 1:4:2,35
But some months, maybe
I will spend eight.


1881
1:4:2,35 --> 1:4:3,48
Some months I spend 12.


1882
1:4:3,48 --> 1:4:5,516
I mean it depends
one, what's going on.


1883
1:4:5,516 --> 1:4:7,14
And then, just so
you guys know, if you


1884
1:4:7,14 --> 1:4:9,348
want me to sign your books,
I'm going to sit up here,


1885
1:4:9,348 --> 1:4:10,97
so we'll go through any of that.


1886
1:4:10,97 --> 1:4:12,22
Did you have another question?


1887
1:4:12,22 --> 1:4:13,15
AUDIENCE: OK, yes.


1888
1:4:13,15 --> 1:4:14,56
What do you think
of Lending Club


1889
1:4:14,56 --> 1:4:18,144
as a vehicle for investment?


1890
1:4:18,144 --> 1:4:19,6
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


1891
1:4:19,6 --> 1:4:21,42
I just think that if
you're in a position where


1892
1:4:21,42 --> 1:4:24,64
you have like an extra
million sitting around,


1893
1:4:24,64 --> 1:4:27,61
then I would be like,
maybe something like that


1894
1:4:27,61 --> 1:4:28,46
could make sense.


1895
1:4:28,46 --> 1:4:30,52
But the truth is,
of all the things


1896
1:4:30,52 --> 1:4:31,51
you could be doing
with your money,


1897
1:4:31,51 --> 1:4:35,11
I would put that as probably
lower on the priority list.


1898
1:4:35,11 --> 1:4:37,6
They of course, are
like-- they actually


1899
1:4:37,6 --> 1:4:40,14
were shut down by the
SEC for a full year.


1900
1:4:40,14 --> 1:4:42,33
Yeah, they had a
bunch of problems.


1901
1:4:42,33 --> 1:4:44,78
And I'm not saying that
they're like risky today,


1902
1:4:44,78 --> 1:4:49,0
but what I am saying is,
I think that it's probably


1903
1:4:49,0 --> 1:4:50,72
not your highest priority.


1904
1:4:50,72 --> 1:4:53,7
I think there's
probably safer things


1905
1:4:53,7 --> 1:4:55,617
to be doing with your money.


1906
1:4:55,617 --> 1:4:56,2
AUDIENCE: Hey.


1907
1:4:56,2 --> 1:4:57,783
So, I'm curious what
your thoughts are


1908
1:4:57,783 --> 1:4:59,382
on paying your
mortgage down early,


1909
1:4:59,382 --> 1:5:1,34
versus taking that money
and kind of putting it


1910
1:5:1,34 --> 1:5:1,82
somewhere else.


1911
1:5:1,82 --> 1:5:3,26
Because obviously with
your mortgage payment,


1912
1:5:3,26 --> 1:5:5,426
you have interest deductions,
all these other things


1913
1:5:5,426 --> 1:5:6,244
like tie into it.


1914
1:5:6,244 --> 1:5:7,16
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


1915
1:5:7,16 --> 1:5:10,5
So again, what we
would do is, literally


1916
1:5:10,5 --> 1:5:12,35
run what's going on in your
life through the system.


1917
1:5:12,35 --> 1:5:13,85
And you can actually
see, it's based


1918
1:5:13,85 --> 1:5:15,641
on what's going on with
your interest rate.


1919
1:5:15,641 --> 1:5:17,62
What other things that
are-- interest rates


1920
1:5:17,62 --> 1:5:19,3
that your juggling.


1921
1:5:19,3 --> 1:5:21,0
And potentially,
the answer is yes.


1922
1:5:21,0 --> 1:5:23,349
Potentially the answer
may be, you know what?


1923
1:5:23,349 --> 1:5:25,39
That extra cash is going
to be much better served


1924
1:5:25,39 --> 1:5:26,9
doing this next
goal that you have,


1925
1:5:26,9 --> 1:5:28,566
because that mortgage
isn't bad for you.


1926
1:5:28,566 --> 1:5:30,989
So it really depends on who
you are, where you're going.


1927
1:5:30,989 --> 1:5:33,53
Do you want to sell your house
in this period of time or not,


1928
1:5:33,53 --> 1:5:34,1
etc.


1929
1:5:34,1 --> 1:5:34,94
So.


1930
1:5:34,94 --> 1:5:38,8
Great question but the answer
there is, run a financial plan,


1931
1:5:38,8 --> 1:5:40,165
and it tells you perfectly.


1932
1:5:40,165 --> 1:5:40,79
AUDIENCE: Cool.


1933
1:5:40,79 --> 1:5:41,26
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Go ahead.


1934
1:5:41,26 --> 1:5:43,42
AUDIENCE: So, I understand
that financial planners


1935
1:5:43,42 --> 1:5:44,86
don't sell us anything right?


1936
1:5:44,86 --> 1:5:48,51
But do they make specific
product recommendations?


1937
1:5:48,51 --> 1:5:53,18
So let's say I need life
insurance, or investments,


1938
1:5:53,18 --> 1:5:54,14
mutual funds.


1939
1:5:54,14 --> 1:5:55,56
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So literally,
our financial planners


1940
1:5:55,56 --> 1:5:56,992
are all full time
on staff for us.


1941
1:5:56,992 --> 1:5:57,95
They're salaried by us.


1942
1:5:57,95 --> 1:6:1,25
Their bonus is only based on
customer satisfaction, customer


1943
1:6:1,25 --> 1:6:2,39
results, period.


1944
1:6:2,39 --> 1:6:4,14
And efficiency of
getting back to you.


1945
1:6:4,14 --> 1:6:4,81
That's it.


1946
1:6:4,81 --> 1:6:6,81
So that's how they
get compensated.


1947
1:6:6,81 --> 1:6:8,81
Let's just say that you
come in and you're like,


1948
1:6:8,81 --> 1:6:9,83
I need life insurance.


1949
1:6:9,83 --> 1:6:11,385
Just, let's use
that as an example.


1950
1:6:11,385 --> 1:6:11,76
AUDIENCE: Right.


1951
1:6:11,76 --> 1:6:13,885
ALEXA VON TOBEL: We would
go through and figure out


1952
1:6:13,885 --> 1:6:15,48
what is actually best for you.


1953
1:6:15,48 --> 1:6:18,106
Hey, you do need
a million of term.


1954
1:6:18,106 --> 1:6:19,23
That's what you can afford.


1955
1:6:19,23 --> 1:6:21,72
That's the best thing
that we can do for you.


1956
1:6:21,72 --> 1:6:22,49
We don't sell it.


1957
1:6:22,49 --> 1:6:24,49
We will then make a
recommendation that


1958
1:6:24,49 --> 1:6:27,28
looks like this,
we like MassMutual


1959
1:6:27,28 --> 1:6:29,69
for this specific
product that you need.


1960
1:6:29,69 --> 1:6:33,527
And we also like Guardian,
and we also like Prudential.


1961
1:6:33,527 --> 1:6:35,36
And then will help you
go and look at those,


1962
1:6:35,36 --> 1:6:36,526
and then you can get quotes.


1963
1:6:36,526 --> 1:6:39,25
Or we'll connect you to an
agent who can then get quotes.


1964
1:6:39,25 --> 1:6:41,93
We will not get a single
dollar in that recommendation.


1965
1:6:41,93 --> 1:6:42,93
Zero.


1966
1:6:42,93 --> 1:6:45,74
It's one of our pillars
of our company's policy


1967
1:6:45,74 --> 1:6:47,74
of being trusted and
unbiased for our customers.


1968
1:6:47,74 --> 1:6:49,24
AUDIENCE: Right but
I still may need


1969
1:6:49,24 --> 1:6:52,874
to go to an agent who would
get a commission on it.


1970
1:6:52,874 --> 1:6:54,54
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You
will go to an agent


1971
1:6:54,54 --> 1:6:56,331
and they still will
get a commission on it.


1972
1:6:56,331 --> 1:6:56,98
That's correct.


1973
1:6:56,98 --> 1:6:58,89
But the takeaway there is
you won't be in a position


1974
1:6:58,89 --> 1:7:1,69
where you go to that agent, and
end up getting too much, or too


1975
1:7:1,69 --> 1:7:2,96
little because you
don't trust them,


1976
1:7:2,96 --> 1:7:4,69
and you don't know what
you're supposed to be doing.


1977
1:7:4,69 --> 1:7:6,32
And one of the things that
we're in the middle of piloting


1978
1:7:6,32 --> 1:7:9,4
is actually us doing it
for you, and you paying us


1979
1:7:9,4 --> 1:7:12,54
a simple fee of like $100,
and we'll go get it for you.


1980
1:7:12,54 --> 1:7:14,68
But we are just
piloting that right now.


1981
1:7:14,68 --> 1:7:16,873
So that we'd just say,
let us do it for you.


1982
1:7:16,873 --> 1:7:17,414
AUDIENCE: OK.


1983
1:7:17,414 --> 1:7:17,806
Thank you.


1984
1:7:17,806 --> 1:7:19,139
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.


1985
1:7:19,139 --> 1:7:19,82
Go ahead.


1986
1:7:19,82 --> 1:7:19,97
Hi.


1987
1:7:19,97 --> 1:7:20,92
AUDIENCE: I just had--


1988
1:7:20,92 --> 1:7:22,36
ALEXA VON TOBEL: And by the
way, thanks guys for, I mean,


1989
1:7:22,36 --> 1:7:24,23
this stuff everyone
really needs help.


1990
1:7:24,23 --> 1:7:26,244
And so, I'm always
never surprised


1991
1:7:26,244 --> 1:7:27,66
by how many questions
people have.


1992
1:7:27,66 --> 1:7:28,53
Go ahead.


1993
1:7:28,53 --> 1:7:31,31
AUDIENCE: Do have any
recourse if you go to a CFP


1994
1:7:31,31 --> 1:7:33,35
and you get bad advice?


1995
1:7:33,35 --> 1:7:36,15
Like factually incorrect
things, or they


1996
1:7:36,15 --> 1:7:38,485
advise you to do something
and it turns out not to work?


1997
1:7:38,485 --> 1:7:39,36
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So--


1998
1:7:39,36 --> 1:7:41,37
AUDIENCE: I'm not talking
about like telling the future


1999
1:7:41,37 --> 1:7:43,245
with like stock market
or anything like that.


2000
1:7:43,245 --> 1:7:43,89
I mean.


2001
1:7:43,89 --> 1:7:44,806
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


2002
1:7:44,806 --> 1:7:47,51
I mean, so first, I'd would be
like, were they actually a CFP?


2003
1:7:47,51 --> 1:7:48,99
So let me just give
you an example.


2004
1:7:48,99 --> 1:7:51,54
I worked at Morgan Stanley.


2005
1:7:51,54 --> 1:7:53,685
A lot of times, they
just have people


2006
1:7:53,685 --> 1:7:54,81
who are just well educated.


2007
1:7:54,81 --> 1:7:57,64
They're actually only licensed
by like a series seven,


2008
1:7:57,64 --> 1:8:0,741
and they like, will give advice,
but they're actually just


2009
1:8:0,741 --> 1:8:2,49
managing investments,
if that makes sense.


2010
1:8:2,49 --> 1:8:4,281
So like, a lot of people
go and get advice,


2011
1:8:4,281 --> 1:8:6,2
and they'll just manage
your investments.


2012
1:8:6,2 --> 1:8:8,64
But none of that other
stuff, which is actually


2013
1:8:8,64 --> 1:8:10,26
step one for what
you should be doing.


2014
1:8:10,26 --> 1:8:12,9
So the takeaway there is,
I would first be like,


2015
1:8:12,9 --> 1:8:15,49
were they even an
expert to begin with.


2016
1:8:15,49 --> 1:8:17,529
If they work for a
reputable company that


2017
1:8:17,529 --> 1:8:20,33
reports to the SEC,
you can complain.


2018
1:8:20,33 --> 1:8:23,18
And you can write a complaint
that then goes on their record.


2019
1:8:23,18 --> 1:8:25,819
We personally will
never hire anyone


2020
1:8:25,819 --> 1:8:27,46
with even a single complaint.


2021
1:8:27,46 --> 1:8:27,545
Done.


2022
1:8:27,545 --> 1:8:28,189
Get outta here.


2023
1:8:28,189 --> 1:8:29,26
We're not hiring you.


2024
1:8:29,26 --> 1:8:31,18
So I think that's
the sort of stuff.


2025
1:8:31,18 --> 1:8:33,359
So the answer is,
the recourse is


2026
1:8:33,359 --> 1:8:37,1
that you can file a
complaint on their record.


2027
1:8:37,1 --> 1:8:38,72
But, I would then,
a lot of people


2028
1:8:38,72 --> 1:8:41,57
get advice from people
that are not experts.


2029
1:8:41,57 --> 1:8:42,39
Because it's really complicated.


2030
1:8:42,39 --> 1:8:43,96
Like, you don't even know
who really an expert is.


2031
1:8:43,96 --> 1:8:46,34
So that's why we say, we
really believe in the CFP.


2032
1:8:46,34 --> 1:8:48,43
There are 69,000 in the
country, and I'm even


2033
1:8:48,43 --> 1:8:50,87
on one of their boards.


2034
1:8:50,87 --> 1:8:53,521
That's like how deep
we are with the CFP.


2035
1:8:53,521 --> 1:8:54,62
AUDIENCE: OK.


2036
1:8:54,62 --> 1:8:54,849
Thanks.


2037
1:8:54,849 --> 1:8:56,14
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Good question.


2038
1:8:56,14 --> 1:8:56,64
Go ahead.


2039
1:8:56,64 --> 1:8:58,767



2040
1:8:58,767 --> 1:9:0,85
AUDIENCE: You described
your automated system that


2041
1:9:0,85 --> 1:9:3,141
tells you should do this,
and this, and this, and that.


2042
1:9:3,141 --> 1:9:5,27
And I've found
with other systems


2043
1:9:5,27 --> 1:9:7,45
that they are often
very inflexible.


2044
1:9:7,45 --> 1:9:11,818
Like, they would make
assumptions like, oh, customers


2045
1:9:11,818 --> 1:9:13,609
should not have to deal
with single stocks.


2046
1:9:13,609 --> 1:9:15,189
They should always
use mutual funds.


2047
1:9:15,189 --> 1:9:20,25
Or customers are generally not
able to control themselves.


2048
1:9:20,25 --> 1:9:21,42
How much they spend.


2049
1:9:21,42 --> 1:9:24,4
So we assume they always over
spend, or something like that.


2050
1:9:24,4 --> 1:9:26,84
And so I find these
systems fairly useless,


2051
1:9:26,84 --> 1:9:29,745
because they don't adjust
to my own personal habits.


2052
1:9:29,745 --> 1:9:30,62
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.


2053
1:9:30,62 --> 1:9:31,69
So, a few things.


2054
1:9:31,69 --> 1:9:32,17
AUDIENCE: How's your
system handling that?


2055
1:9:32,17 --> 1:9:32,569
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
So actually, what's


2056
1:9:32,569 --> 1:9:35,29
really cool about our system,
and this is like super dorky,


2057
1:9:35,29 --> 1:9:36,237
but just to give you a sense.


2058
1:9:36,237 --> 1:9:38,71
There's actually behind the
system, is 44 standards.


2059
1:9:38,71 --> 1:9:40,18
They're literally
the 44 standards


2060
1:9:40,18 --> 1:9:42,479
of every single person's life.


2061
1:9:42,479 --> 1:9:44,21
It's not in the book actually.


2062
1:9:44,21 --> 1:9:46,75
We took it out because it
like overwhelmed people.


2063
1:9:46,75 --> 1:9:48,37
But there's actually a grid.


2064
1:9:48,37 --> 1:9:50,84
And it literally, for
each step, there's


2065
1:9:50,84 --> 1:9:53,64
basically 15 things
that are critical.


2066
1:9:53,64 --> 1:9:55,76
And when you get a
plan, we actually


2067
1:9:55,76 --> 1:9:59,15
will circle what's urgent,
so that you are aware of,


2068
1:9:59,15 --> 1:10:0,1
here are the things.


2069
1:10:0,1 --> 1:10:2,6
But that's when you then get
on the phone with your expert,


2070
1:10:2,6 --> 1:10:3,55
and when we're
delivering a plan.


2071
1:10:3,55 --> 1:10:5,493
And so it happens
in the sign up flow,


2072
1:10:5,493 --> 1:10:7,243
when you're actually
filling out the form.


2073
1:10:7,243 --> 1:10:8,62
But then also, on
the first call,


2074
1:10:8,62 --> 1:10:9,9
we call it the listening call.


2075
1:10:9,9 --> 1:10:11,15
Where you say,
here are the things


2076
1:10:11,15 --> 1:10:12,51
that I like that I want to do.


2077
1:10:12,51 --> 1:10:16,49
We'll then tell you, hey,
maybe you want single stocks.


2078
1:10:16,49 --> 1:10:18,19
We don't like them
for these reasons.


2079
1:10:18,19 --> 1:10:18,87
You now know.


2080
1:10:18,87 --> 1:10:21,8
But if that's what you
want to do, we'll help you.


2081
1:10:21,8 --> 1:10:22,27
But we'll tell you
it's like really


2082
1:10:22,27 --> 1:10:23,48
damaging for your finances.


2083
1:10:23,48 --> 1:10:25,813
You know, some people walk
in and they're like, I really


2084
1:10:25,813 --> 1:10:27,58
like to bury money my backyard.


2085
1:10:27,58 --> 1:10:30,74
And we're like, I
get that you love


2086
1:10:30,74 --> 1:10:32,97
that, we don't recommend that.


2087
1:10:32,97 --> 1:10:35,2
And so, there's a little
bit of like a process.


2088
1:10:35,2 --> 1:10:37,459
But you get to weigh in
on what you care about.


2089
1:10:37,459 --> 1:10:39,0
And also, we help
you ultimately work


2090
1:10:39,0 --> 1:10:40,73
on what you want to work on.


2091
1:10:40,73 --> 1:10:43,1
But if there's something
that is really critical,


2092
1:10:43,1 --> 1:10:45,3
we're like you are at risk.


2093
1:10:45,3 --> 1:10:47,3
And then, you can
either do it or not.


2094
1:10:47,3 --> 1:10:48,46
We strongly recommend you do it.


2095
1:10:48,46 --> 1:10:50,34
We try to hold you accountable.


2096
1:10:50,34 --> 1:10:54,3
But at the end of the day,
we don't force you to do it.


2097
1:10:54,3 --> 1:10:56,52
AUDIENCE: So once I tell my
adviser on the phone that I


2098
1:10:56,52 --> 1:10:57,2
really--


2099
1:10:57,2 --> 1:10:58,12
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So it's
a very flexible schedule.


2100
1:10:58,12 --> 1:10:58,69
So the takeaway--


2101
1:10:58,69 --> 1:11:0,314
AUDIENCE: So that I
really want to bury


2102
1:11:0,314 --> 1:11:2,18
my money in the
backyard, is your system


2103
1:11:2,18 --> 1:11:3,375
able to deal with that?


2104
1:11:3,375 --> 1:11:4,25
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yes.


2105
1:11:4,25 --> 1:11:6,87
The takeaway is, the
system literally, is built.


2106
1:11:6,87 --> 1:11:8,916
There's 44 standards,
and they can move around


2107
1:11:8,916 --> 1:11:10,29
based on what the
customer wants.


2108
1:11:10,29 --> 1:11:11,41
There's also a few
filters where it's


2109
1:11:11,41 --> 1:11:13,118
like, this customer's
really overwhelmed.


2110
1:11:13,118 --> 1:11:15,2
So let's give him slower goals.


2111
1:11:15,2 --> 1:11:16,39
This customer's a champ.


2112
1:11:16,39 --> 1:11:18,46
I walk in, I'm like, let's
go tell me everything.


2113
1:11:18,46 --> 1:11:19,21
I want to know it.


2114
1:11:19,21 --> 1:11:20,15
I want to see it.


2115
1:11:20,15 --> 1:11:22,99
But it depends on,
and you can decide.


2116
1:11:22,99 --> 1:11:25,81
So you actually, it's very
much built around who you are.


2117
1:11:25,81 --> 1:11:27,351
And that's actually
one of the things


2118
1:11:27,351 --> 1:11:29,27
that's a requirement
of LearnVest.


2119
1:11:29,27 --> 1:11:31,38
You have to know your
customer to a law.


2120
1:11:31,38 --> 1:11:32,84
You have to know your customer.


2121
1:11:32,84 --> 1:11:34,16
How they want to act.


2122
1:11:34,16 --> 1:11:35,1
What they care about.


2123
1:11:35,1 --> 1:11:37,705
And that form you
fill out, is actually,


2124
1:11:37,705 --> 1:11:40,18
it's not just like us being
like, we'd love to know.


2125
1:11:40,18 --> 1:11:42,35
We actually legally need
to know what you care about


2126
1:11:42,35 --> 1:11:43,516
and how you want to operate.


2127
1:11:43,516 --> 1:11:44,43
So.


2128
1:11:44,43 --> 1:11:46,83
AUDIENCE: A different question
that just came to my mind.


2129
1:11:46,83 --> 1:11:48,746
There was the previous
question about privacy,


2130
1:11:48,746 --> 1:11:51,59
and you said you don't
have any account numbers


2131
1:11:51,59 --> 1:11:52,92
and stuff, right?


2132
1:11:52,92 --> 1:11:55,23
But you do link
into our account so


2133
1:11:55,23 --> 1:11:57,89
that we can see our
balance in your system.


2134
1:11:57,89 --> 1:12:0,53
ALEXA VON TOBEL: But it doesn't
pull your account number.


2135
1:12:0,53 --> 1:12:2,9
AUDIENCE: So how do you
get my information if you


2136
1:12:2,9 --> 1:12:5,17
don't-- without having
all my bank information?


2137
1:12:5,17 --> 1:12:6,25
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So
it's as simple as this.


2138
1:12:6,25 --> 1:12:7,916
Let's just say you're
linking your bank.


2139
1:12:7,916 --> 1:12:9,73
You literally, to
link it, all you do


2140
1:12:9,73 --> 1:12:11,88
and it takes less
than about 45 seconds.


2141
1:12:11,88 --> 1:12:15,16
You go, Fidelity, my
username, my password, boom.


2142
1:12:15,16 --> 1:12:17,39
And it pulls in just
the information.


2143
1:12:17,39 --> 1:12:18,8
The data.


2144
1:12:18,8 --> 1:12:19,99
It's not pulling in your account
number, your routing number.


2145
1:12:19,99 --> 1:12:21,844
It's not pulling in all
of that information.


2146
1:12:21,844 --> 1:12:23,51
But we can see at the
transaction level,


2147
1:12:23,51 --> 1:12:23,77
so you can see--


2148
1:12:23,77 --> 1:12:25,82
AUDIENCE: But you would have
my username and my password.


2149
1:12:25,82 --> 1:12:27,1
ALEXA VON TOBEL: We have your
username and your password.


2150
1:12:27,1 --> 1:12:29,18
But we don't store your
username and password.


2151
1:12:29,18 --> 1:12:30,22
It's just like Mint.


2152
1:12:30,22 --> 1:12:31,45
It's just like Quicken Books.


2153
1:12:31,45 --> 1:12:32,24
It's just like--


2154
1:12:32,24 --> 1:12:33,37
AUDIENCE: I don't
know these products.


2155
1:12:33,37 --> 1:12:34,286
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


2156
1:12:34,286 --> 1:12:36,828
AUDIENCE: But don't you update
that information all the time?


2157
1:12:36,828 --> 1:12:38,452
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
Every time you log in.


2158
1:12:38,452 --> 1:12:39,28
It just pulls it.


2159
1:12:39,28 --> 1:12:42,1
AUDIENCE: But then I have to
type in my other passwords


2160
1:12:42,1 --> 1:12:42,895
all the time?


2161
1:12:42,895 --> 1:12:43,23
ALEXA VON TOBEL: No.


2162
1:12:43,23 --> 1:12:44,65
Once they're linked
their linked.


2163
1:12:44,65 --> 1:12:45,63
And that connection's there.


2164
1:12:45,63 --> 1:12:47,96
And every time you log in,
we refresh the latest data


2165
1:12:47,96 --> 1:12:50,332
from the last 30 day--
the last 90 days.


2166
1:12:50,332 --> 1:12:51,29
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]--


2167
1:12:51,29 --> 1:12:53,581
ALEXA VON TOBEL: And if you
had an account for like, me


2168
1:12:53,581 --> 1:12:55,62
from the beginning, we
store all your trends


2169
1:12:55,62 --> 1:12:56,58
from literally day one.


2170
1:12:56,58 --> 1:12:57,96
And you can see it all.


2171
1:12:57,96 --> 1:13:0,1
It's really amazing actually.


2172
1:13:0,1 --> 1:13:2,11
I, living in New York,
restaurant and bars,


2173
1:13:2,11 --> 1:13:3,45
I'm like, I live at my company.


2174
1:13:3,45 --> 1:13:3,95
Right?


2175
1:13:3,95 --> 1:13:7,815
Like I literally like can't
cook, because I'm just working.


2176
1:13:7,815 --> 1:13:9,356
And so it was like,
I never knew what


2177
1:13:9,356 --> 1:13:10,53
I was spending on
restaurant and bars.


2178
1:13:10,53 --> 1:13:12,35
And quickly it was
like, oh my goodness.


2179
1:13:12,35 --> 1:13:15,33
I can see exactly, and it's
much worse than I thought.


2180
1:13:15,33 --> 1:13:17,6
So we can pull those
trends and analysis.


2181
1:13:17,6 --> 1:13:18,8
But when you log
in, you don't have


2182
1:13:18,8 --> 1:13:20,57
to re insert your
username and password.


2183
1:13:20,57 --> 1:13:21,39
It's one time and then it pulls.


2184
1:13:21,39 --> 1:13:21,75
OK.


2185
1:13:21,75 --> 1:13:22,34
AUDIENCE: Thank you.


2186
1:13:22,34 --> 1:13:23,5
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.


2187
1:13:23,5 --> 1:13:23,96
Go ahead.


2188
1:13:23,96 --> 1:13:24,89
AUDIENCE: Yeah.


2189
1:13:24,89 --> 1:13:27,77
I am getting married this
year and I was wondering--


2190
1:13:27,77 --> 1:13:28,16
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Congrats.


2191
1:13:28,16 --> 1:13:28,48
AUDIENCE: Thank you.


2192
1:13:28,48 --> 1:13:29,63
ALEXA VON TOBEL: I
got married this year.


2193
1:13:29,63 --> 1:13:29,92
AUDIENCE: Huh?


2194
1:13:29,92 --> 1:13:31,16
ALEXA VON TOBEL: I
got married in 2013


2195
1:13:31,16 --> 1:13:31,74
AUDIENCE: Oh good.


2196
1:13:31,74 --> 1:13:32,24
Yes.


2197
1:13:32,24 --> 1:13:34,38
So I was wondering,
if I sign up for this,


2198
1:13:34,38 --> 1:13:37,57
and then my fiance also
signs up, can we merge?


2199
1:13:37,57 --> 1:13:39,7
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
It's per household.


2200
1:13:39,7 --> 1:13:39,83
It's just you guys.


2201
1:13:39,83 --> 1:13:40,19
Both of you.


2202
1:13:40,19 --> 1:13:40,42
One account.


2203
1:13:40,42 --> 1:13:41,57
AUDIENCE: So we can go--


2204
1:13:41,57 --> 1:13:42,945
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
My husband and I


2205
1:13:42,945 --> 1:13:45,1
have a plan, even though
I'm the CEO and a CFP


2206
1:13:45,1 --> 1:13:45,9
and wrote this book.


2207
1:13:45,9 --> 1:13:48,4
We have a second set of eyes
looking at what we're doing.


2208
1:13:48,4 --> 1:13:50,97
AUDIENCE: Even if our bank
accounts aren't joined yet?


2209
1:13:50,97 --> 1:13:51,31
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


2210
1:13:51,31 --> 1:13:52,2
Totally fine.


2211
1:13:52,2 --> 1:13:53,9
AUDIENCE: We can sign up
under the same account?


2212
1:13:53,9 --> 1:13:53,66
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.


2213
1:13:53,66 --> 1:13:53,86
It's your household.


2214
1:13:53,86 --> 1:13:55,44
AUDIENCE: And you guys would
work with us as far as--


2215
1:13:55,44 --> 1:13:56,7
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You can
both get on the phone.


2216
1:13:56,7 --> 1:13:58,14
Sometimes my husband
doesn't get on the phone


2217
1:13:58,14 --> 1:13:59,37
because he has to miss it.


2218
1:13:59,37 --> 1:14:1,29
I get on it, he can get on it.


2219
1:14:1,29 --> 1:14:3,7
And actually, to be honest,
I've been giving it--


2220
1:14:3,7 --> 1:14:5,29
so we like literally
see it gifted as a baby


2221
1:14:5,29 --> 1:14:6,936
gift, a wedding gift.


2222
1:14:6,936 --> 1:14:8,56
We see kids giving
it to their parents,


2223
1:14:8,56 --> 1:14:9,893
parents giving it to their kids.


2224
1:14:9,893 --> 1:14:12,82
Last night people bought like
10 plans for their friends.


2225
1:14:12,82 --> 1:14:15,374
I mean, it's really amazing
how often it's gifted.


2226
1:14:15,374 --> 1:14:17,79
But particularly for a wedding,
it's such a critical time.


2227
1:14:17,79 --> 1:14:20,8
Like you're dealing
with all that stuff.


2228
1:14:20,8 --> 1:14:22,541
Our experts are experts at that.


2229
1:14:22,541 --> 1:14:24,4
And so you both--
and it's one-- you


2230
1:14:24,4 --> 1:14:25,623
don't have to buy
two plans, just one.


2231
1:14:25,623 --> 1:14:26,95
And also, if your life changes.


2232
1:14:26,95 --> 1:14:29,17
Let's say tomorrow, you're
like, we're having a baby!


2233
1:14:29,17 --> 1:14:30,97
We don't make you re-buy a plan.


2234
1:14:30,97 --> 1:14:32,61
We just rerun your information.


2235
1:14:32,61 --> 1:14:34,82
And be like, hey you now
have a different goal.


2236
1:14:34,82 --> 1:14:36,11
And so that's why it's
like a gym membership.


2237
1:14:36,11 --> 1:14:37,93
You pay the up front
fee, it's $19 a month,


2238
1:14:37,93 --> 1:14:39,506
it's always the same expert.


2239
1:14:39,506 --> 1:14:40,3
AUDIENCE: OK.


2240
1:14:40,3 --> 1:14:41,216
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Cool.


2241
1:14:41,216 --> 1:14:43,71



2242
1:14:43,71 --> 1:14:44,98
Do you have another question?


2243
1:14:44,98 --> 1:14:45,48
Wow.


2244
1:14:45,48 --> 1:14:46,46
Awesome guys.


2245
1:14:46,46 --> 1:14:48,15
And guys, keep me
honest Annie for when


2246
1:14:48,15 --> 1:14:49,89
I know I have to go
to the other Google.


2247
1:14:49,89 --> 1:14:53,911

dedicated promo code.


2248
1:14:53,911 --> 1:14:54,41

2249
1:14:54,41 --> 1:14:57,89
And if you guys get a plan,
I'm just going to say,


2250
1:14:57,89 --> 1:15:0,7
Annie's email address
is a-n-n-i-e@LearnVest.


2251
1:15:0,7 --> 1:15:2,856
If you buy a plan today,
and just shoot us a note,


2252
1:15:2,856 --> 1:15:4,73
we'll get you an extra
free month of service.


2253
1:15:4,73 --> 1:15:7,74
So another free month of $19.


2254
1:15:7,74 --> 1:15:9,211
That's just a
benefit for you guys.


2255
1:15:9,211 --> 1:15:11,71
AUDIENCE: One of the biggest
parts of any financial planning


2256
1:15:11,71 --> 1:15:13,25
is taxes.


2257
1:15:13,25 --> 1:15:14,17
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.


2258
1:15:14,17 --> 1:15:17,5
Income tax planning is actually
six pillars of-- the CFP


2259
1:15:17,5 --> 1:15:18,159
is six pillars.


2260
1:15:18,159 --> 1:15:20,7
Income tax planning, insurance
planning, investment planning,


2261
1:15:20,7 --> 1:15:23,9
retirement planning, general
principles, and then,


2262
1:15:23,9 --> 1:15:25,15
what did I miss?


2263
1:15:25,15 --> 1:15:26,12
Estate planning.


2264
1:15:26,12 --> 1:15:28,8
Estate planning was biatch.


2265
1:15:28,8 --> 1:15:32,96
So, our experts are
experts in all six.


2266
1:15:32,96 --> 1:15:35,2
AUDIENCE: So we just
learned this, actually.


2267
1:15:35,2 --> 1:15:38,57
The advisors actually give
like tax planning advice and--


2268
1:15:38,57 --> 1:15:40,66
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So as
part of-- so, so, let me


2269
1:15:40,66 --> 1:15:41,52
give you an example.


2270
1:15:41,52 --> 1:15:42,936
If you have like,
over $5 million,


2271
1:15:42,936 --> 1:15:44,83
and you're in a
position where like,


2272
1:15:44,83 --> 1:15:47,494
you have pretty complex
income tax planning,


2273
1:15:47,494 --> 1:15:48,91
we would actually
go and recommend


2274
1:15:48,91 --> 1:15:51,88
that you do that with
an income tax expert.


2275
1:15:51,88 --> 1:15:53,371
However, most people.


2276
1:15:53,371 --> 1:15:54,87
Your income tax
planning is actually


2277
1:15:54,87 --> 1:15:56,47
just the basics of
financial planning.


2278
1:15:56,47 --> 1:15:57,26
And so yes.


2279
1:15:57,26 --> 1:15:59,81
You do get basic income
tax planning advice.


2280
1:15:59,81 --> 1:16:2,47
But if you're someone who's
like, owns five properties,


2281
1:16:2,47 --> 1:16:4,34
like, we're like,
you've complexity


2282
1:16:4,34 --> 1:16:6,1
that is beyond a normal plan.


2283
1:16:6,1 --> 1:16:7,12
Let's go get that.


2284
1:16:7,12 --> 1:16:10,72
Estate planning was actually
the pillar called protect.


2285
1:16:10,72 --> 1:16:13,99
So we include that in insurance
and estate, is pillar five.


2286
1:16:13,99 --> 1:16:17,0
And we do give basic
estate planning advice.


2287
1:16:17,0 --> 1:16:19,22
Because that's things
like, simple things guys


2288
1:16:19,22 --> 1:16:21,54
like TOD and P-- stuff
that you wouldn't even


2289
1:16:21,54 --> 1:16:22,481
know to know about.


2290
1:16:22,481 --> 1:16:24,23
It's really basic
things that you can just


2291
1:16:24,23 --> 1:16:27,14
do on your account, wherever it
may be, to protect, God forbid,


2292
1:16:27,14 --> 1:16:27,97
anything happens.


2293
1:16:27,97 --> 1:16:29,345
AUDIENCE: So that
includes things


2294
1:16:29,345 --> 1:16:31,3
like setting up trusts and--


2295
1:16:31,3 --> 1:16:33,74
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So if you're
setting up a basic trust,


2296
1:16:33,74 --> 1:16:36,156
that's the type of thing our
expert can talk to you about.


2297
1:16:36,156 --> 1:16:38,83
If you're setting up
some very complex trust,


2298
1:16:38,83 --> 1:16:41,937
depending on again, and one of
the takeaways that we say is,


2299
1:16:41,937 --> 1:16:43,895
we have customers who
have millions of dollars,


2300
1:16:43,895 --> 1:16:46,37
and that we can give really
great advice to and service.


2301
1:16:46,37 --> 1:16:49,6
But we would look at how complex
you are, what's going on.


2302
1:16:49,6 --> 1:16:52,21
And if it's something that
if you're in that situation,


2303
1:16:52,21 --> 1:16:54,1
and it's so beyond,
we would say,


2304
1:16:54,1 --> 1:16:56,91
here's an estate planner that
we really like, that we trust,


2305
1:16:56,91 --> 1:16:57,793
work with them.


2306
1:16:57,793 --> 1:16:58,66
AUDIENCE: I see.


2307
1:16:58,66 --> 1:16:59,16
OK.


2308
1:16:59,16 --> 1:17:0,35
Thank you.


2309
1:17:0,35 --> 1:17:2,58
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
Any other questions?


2310
1:17:2,58 --> 1:17:3,26
Go for it.


2311
1:17:3,26 --> 1:17:5,385
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have a
follow up to his question.


2312
1:17:5,385 --> 1:17:8,37
Now, in your answer
it sounded like you're


2313
1:17:8,37 --> 1:17:10,15
giving advice for income tax.


2314
1:17:10,15 --> 1:17:12,384
You're giving advice
for estate planning.


2315
1:17:12,384 --> 1:17:14,8
But you're not actually doing
the estate planning with me,


2316
1:17:14,8 --> 1:17:15,3
do you?


2317
1:17:15,3 --> 1:17:17,759
I mean I'd still need to get
the forms from somewhere else,


2318
1:17:17,759 --> 1:17:20,8
and still need to fill them
out myself, and still need


2319
1:17:20,8 --> 1:17:20,93
to file them myself.


2320
1:17:20,93 --> 1:17:22,49
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So here's,
I'll give you an example.


2321
1:17:22,49 --> 1:17:24,14
So first, the
income tax planning


2322
1:17:24,14 --> 1:17:26,1
is actually part of
actually making a plan.


2323
1:17:26,1 --> 1:17:29,26
So I'll give you an example.


2324
1:17:29,26 --> 1:17:31,744
When I recommend a Roth
IRA versus a regular IRA,


2325
1:17:31,744 --> 1:17:33,91
that's actually a little
bit of income tax planning.


2326
1:17:33,91 --> 1:17:35,44
Because based on which
one you should get,


2327
1:17:35,44 --> 1:17:37,106
is based on what your
income is and what


2328
1:17:37,106 --> 1:17:38,15
your tax bracket will be.


2329
1:17:38,15 --> 1:17:39,974
So that's part of the plan.


2330
1:17:39,974 --> 1:17:40,64
Just in general.


2331
1:17:40,64 --> 1:17:43,83
Income tax planning is sort
of a pillar of all planning.


2332
1:17:43,83 --> 1:17:46,81
If you're in a position
where it's like,


2333
1:17:46,81 --> 1:17:49,78
you're making $1.5
million and we could maybe


2334
1:17:49,78 --> 1:17:52,65
help shepherd some of that
so you could afford taxes


2335
1:17:52,65 --> 1:17:54,4
in like a thoughtful
planning way.


2336
1:17:54,4 --> 1:17:56,33
That's like, high level
income tax planning.


2337
1:17:56,33 --> 1:18:0,12
So just in general, income tax
planning is part of every plan.


2338
1:18:0,12 --> 1:18:2,159
And then for things
like documents.


2339
1:18:2,159 --> 1:18:3,95
So we actually get a
discount at LegalZoom.


2340
1:18:3,95 --> 1:18:6,646
We like them a lot, because
they make it really affordable.


2341
1:18:6,646 --> 1:18:8,27
A lot of people go
get wills and end up


2342
1:18:8,27 --> 1:18:9,75
spending $1,000 to do it.


2343
1:18:9,75 --> 1:18:12,42
And we're like, you can get just
as good of a will doing this.


2344
1:18:12,42 --> 1:18:14,336
But we'll show you exactly
which one you need,


2345
1:18:14,336 --> 1:18:15,89
exactly how to fill it out.


2346
1:18:15,89 --> 1:18:18,1
And then one thing that
confidentially we're


2347
1:18:18,1 --> 1:18:20,82
rolling out is as part of
getting a plan with us,


2348
1:18:20,82 --> 1:18:22,83
were also starting
to offer classes.


2349
1:18:22,83 --> 1:18:24,85
So detailed, step by step.


2350
1:18:24,85 --> 1:18:26,88
If you're like, how
do I fill out my will?


2351
1:18:26,88 --> 1:18:30,45
Literally, here's exactly,
those sort of things.


2352
1:18:30,45 --> 1:18:32,12
How do I deal with
getting a mortgage?


2353
1:18:32,12 --> 1:18:33,32
Or refinancing my mortgage?


2354
1:18:33,32 --> 1:18:33,989
Step by step.


2355
1:18:33,989 --> 1:18:35,53
That's the sort of
content that we're


2356
1:18:35,53 --> 1:18:38,113
creating so you can just like,
attend a quick 30 minute class,


2357
1:18:38,113 --> 1:18:39,46
or download a webinar.


2358
1:18:39,46 --> 1:18:40,98
We show you exactly
how to do it.


2359
1:18:40,98 --> 1:18:43,77
AUDIENCE: And come tax season,
right now basically, I still


2360
1:18:43,77 --> 1:18:45,99
need to get my own CPA
or do you have to--


2361
1:18:45,99 --> 1:18:46,906
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.


2362
1:18:46,906 --> 1:18:48,969
We do not do your taxes.


2363
1:18:48,969 --> 1:18:51,51
But we help you prepare for what
you need to do, and tell you


2364
1:18:51,51 --> 1:18:52,19
what you need to do.


2365
1:18:52,19 --> 1:18:53,53
But we don't actually
file them for you.


2366
1:18:53,53 --> 1:18:54,71
AUDIENCE: OK.


2367
1:18:54,71 --> 1:18:54,67
Thank you.


2368
1:18:54,67 --> 1:18:57,49
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Just separate
types of financial planning.


2369
1:18:57,49 --> 1:18:58,58
Any other questions?


2370
1:18:58,58 --> 1:18:59,4
OK.


2371
1:18:59,4 --> 1:19:0,43
Great.


2372
1:19:0,43 --> 1:19:3,372

anyone wants to get a plan,


2373

2374
1:19:5,8 --> 1:19:7,413

book while I'm walking out,

1:19:7,413 --> 1:19:8,39
