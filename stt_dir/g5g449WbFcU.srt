1
0:0:8,309 --> 0:0:12,849
Okay. Briefly. Jacque is an industrial designer
but mostly a social engineer. He lived through


2
0:0:12,849 --> 0:0:18,96
the great depression in 1929 and came out
of it thinking that there was still goods


3
0:0:18,96 --> 0:0:23,609
in store windows, things in ca..cars in car
lots but people just didn't have the money


4
0:0:23,609 --> 0:0:30,779
to buy things. So he realized it was the rules
of the game that we play by that were so screwed


5
0:0:30,779 --> 0:0:36,6
up... and from when he was very young, he
set out to find an alternative social design


6
0:0:36,6 --> 0:0:40,769
to take care of the problems that we have
today. This is what's very different between


7
0:0:40,769 --> 0:0:47,79
Jacque and other protestors and people who..who
understand that the system is not working


8
0:0:47,79 --> 0:0:53,51
but they do not pose an alternative. I don't
know of anyone else who tries to find the


9
0:0:53,51 --> 0:0:59,949
root causes of the problems and understands
that things cannot be fixed within the monetary


10
0:0:59,949 --> 0:1:7,28
system and the system that we live by today.
So, Jacque has worked.. He's 95 years old.


11
0:1:7,28 --> 0:1:13,759
He's worked since he was very young to..working
with people: drug addicts, alcoholics.. changing


12
0:1:13,759 --> 0:1:19,84
them, joining the Klu Klux Klan and changing
them. Putting his educational processes to


13
0:1:19,84 --> 0:1:25,369
test.. and understanding if he needs to change
the world, he needs to be able to change peoples


14
0:1:25,369 --> 0:1:32,79
values as well. So, he's arrived at a totally
new social design and he backs it up technically!


15
0:1:32,79 --> 0:1:35,95
These are not just words that he's talk about.
If you go to our website: "THEVENUSPROJECT.COM"


16
0:1:35,95 --> 0:1:42,259
You'll see what this..this new world civilization,
this sustainable future would look like. Jacque


17
0:1:42,259 --> 0:1:51,729
Fresco: So I see, eventually, whether The
Venus Project gets off the ground or not,


18
0:1:51,729 --> 0:1:58,85
this is what I see: I see machines displacing
people... and if you displace people in the


19
0:1:58,85 --> 0:2:4,709
automotive industry, where the machine picks
up the car, puts the wheels on.. you're displacing


20
0:2:4,709 --> 0:2:10,459
millions of people. You don't need air conditioning.
You don't need to pay em' for vacations. You


21
0:2:10,459 --> 0:2:15,76
don't need to take out insurance on their
health.. and you don't need all the lights


22
0:2:15,76 --> 0:2:21,54
you need with people working there. So, industry
will put in machines, wherever they can..


23
0:2:21,54 --> 0:2:27,56
but here's the downfall: If you keep doing
that all over the country, people will not


24
0:2:27,56 --> 0:2:33,799
have the money to buy vacuum cleaners, electric
fans, or refrigerators. If you displace most


25
0:2:33,799 --> 0:2:41,0
people by machines, "How are they gonna buy
things?" So, it's a self-contradictory system...


26
0:2:41,0 --> 0:2:49,459
and THIS is the basis of understanding: That
politics was good 100 years ago but it's obsolete


27
0:2:49,459 --> 0:2:56,31
today. Everything that you have in your own,
those of you that have a home... Your television


28
0:2:56,31 --> 0:3:2,49
set, your washing machine, your refrigerator,
your electric lights are all technical! There's


29
0:3:2,49 --> 0:3:9,9
nothing political about that. It's all technical.
If you took away the technology today, you'd


30
0:3:9,9 --> 0:3:17,68
have people pulling boats along the river.
Do you understand that? It's technology that


31
0:3:17,68 --> 0:3:22,239
frees you from things. It's electric air-conditioning
that makes your house tolerable. So, we don't


32
0:3:22,239 --> 0:3:29,78
want to put the technicians in control anymore
than they're in control today. All the technicians


33
0:3:29,78 --> 0:3:32,569
do is build bridges if you're a bridge designer.
If you're an air plane designer, you can work


34
0:3:32,569 --> 0:3:40,6
on air plane designing but you don't tell
people what to do. It isn't that technicians


35
0:3:40,6 --> 0:3:45,79
will rule the world. I'm against that! I'm
against scientist ruling the world! I don't


36
0:3:45,79 --> 0:3:53,599
see any real scientist protesting against
the exploitation of young kids when they work


37
0:3:53,599 --> 0:3:58,379
in factories. We use to hire children that
were 12 years old and put them in factories


38
0:3:58,379 --> 0:4:4,65
and work em' saturday and sunday. It's when
people march to free those kids from those


39
0:4:4,65 --> 0:4:9,969
conditions. "Why do women have to fight for
women rights?" "Why did women have to march


40
0:4:9,969 --> 0:4:15,15
years ago for a public library?" I don't know
why JUST women did but they did march and


41
0:4:15,15 --> 0:4:21,28
they wanted a public library so if people
couldn't afford books, they could have access


42
0:4:21,28 --> 0:4:27,569
to books. Then there's the metaphysician who
really believes that everybody has goodness


43
0:4:27,569 --> 0:4:34,3
within themselves. They really don't have
anything within themselves. If you were brought


44
0:4:34,3 --> 0:4:40,11
up in Nazi Germany as a baby, after Hitler
burned most the books, you'd be a Nazi. If


45
0:4:40,11 --> 0:4:44,919
you're brought up in Australia, you'd say,
"How are ya' mate?!" That would be normal


46
0:4:44,919 --> 0:4:50,46
to the way you speak. If you're brought up
in Germany, "Deutschland Å¸ber alles!"..Germany


47
0:4:50,46 --> 0:4:56,19
above all. If you're brought up that way.
So you musn't hate anybody because their all


48
0:4:56,19 --> 0:5:2,93
brought up. "What are American soldiers?"
They are killing machines. They're not taught


49
0:5:2,93 --> 0:5:7,69
anything..anything else. If I had anything
to do with it, I would take ALL the soldiers,


50
0:5:7,69 --> 0:5:14,24
send em' back to the university to become
problem solvers. We have allot of problems


51
0:5:14,24 --> 0:5:20,68
that aren't solved... and that's what we need.
Problem solvers! For every Edison we found,


52
0:5:20,68 --> 0:5:30,2
imagine all the Edison's we never found. I
don't say Edison was good either. He was a


53
0:5:30,2 --> 0:5:32,289
crook also. Crowd Question: "Don't scientist
usually rely on statistics to make a decision?


54
0:5:32,289 --> 0:5:37,22
It seems, uh, usually, its, you know, statistical
analysis and then they draw a conclusion from


55
0:5:37,22 --> 0:5:39,479
that and then, you know, as science evolves
and as we make new sciences, we will again


56
0:5:39,479 --> 0:5:41,59
have like better kinds of statistics or whatever
and then we'll apply those to the new technology


57
0:5:41,59 --> 0:5:51,18
that we develop. So how do we develop a language
that's not subject to interpretation.. or


58
0:5:51,18 --> 0:5:56,9
statistical interpretation?!" Jacque Fresco:
"Scientist today are commercially rewarded


59
0:5:56,9 --> 0:6:0,9
for being chemist or working for the drug
companies or working for the aircraft companies.


60
0:6:0,9 --> 0:6:5,599
They're just as corrupt as anyone else...
and scientist, if they were scientist, they'd


61
0:6:5,599 --> 0:6:9,629
say, "What makes war? Why are we going to
war with Germany? What's the problem? What


62
0:6:9,629 --> 0:6:16,349
makes a man the way they are?" They wouldn't
stay in their field. Today their chemist.


63
0:6:16,349 --> 0:6:20,84
They're scientific in chemistry. Then there's
structural engineers that are scientific in


64
0:6:20,84 --> 0:6:25,58
structures... but they're not scientific in
human relation. They know nothing about it


65
0:6:25,58 --> 0:6:29,99
or little about human behavior. So, I'm saying
there's no such thing as a scientist, YET!


66
0:6:29,99 --> 0:6:41,539
Otherwise, they'd be out here in the protest.
Do you understand? I'm not talking about a


67
0:6:41,539 --> 0:6:47,77
world managed by scientist... but a world
managed by scientific method! That means first


68
0:6:47,77 --> 0:6:55,25
you do a survey of Texas, "How much air able
land do you have?" "How much water do you


69
0:6:55,25 --> 0:7:0,729
have underground?" After you do that survey,
you can estimate how big a city can be built


70
0:7:0,729 --> 0:7:8,169
in that region. If it doesn't have the resources,
it won't work. If you have a population far


71
0:7:8,169 --> 0:7:14,3
above 7 billion, there will not be enough
food to go around and there's gonna be territorial


72
0:7:14,3 --> 0:7:21,65
disputes. Territorial disputes are not made
by bad people or fascists or communists or


73
0:7:21,65 --> 0:7:27,629
socialists free enterprises. They're made
by social conditions called, "The March of


74
0:7:27,629 --> 0:7:33,47
Events". In other words, if a meteor were
coming toward the Earth, I can assure you


75
0:7:33,47 --> 0:7:38,539
that all nations would stop their armies and
navies and share ideas with one another to


76
0:7:38,539 --> 0:7:43,99
try to divert that meteor away from the Earth.
Not because they're good but because they're


77
0:7:43,99 --> 0:7:50,94
all threatened. All nations will join together
on any common threat if they realize it. Crowd


78
0:7:50,94 --> 0:7:56,12
Question: "I'm a mother of 7 children. Which
of my 5 children should not be here so that


79
0:7:56,12 --> 0:8:0,979
way it would reduce the population of the
Earth?!" Jacque Fresco: "Well, all i can say,


80
0:8:0,979 --> 0:8:7,819
if you want a world without war, without hunger,
without poverty, it has to be in accordance


81
0:8:7,819 --> 0:8:13,9
with the carrying capacity of the Earth's
resources. If you go beyond that, you're going


82
0:8:13,9 --> 0:8:17,199
to have trouble. Do you understand what I'm
saying? Crowd Question: "It seems to me what


83
0:8:17,199 --> 0:8:21,229
you're saying is, that you want fewer people
but who are you to designate who the people


84
0:8:21,229 --> 0:8:26,52
that should and should not be here?!" Roxanne:
No, he's not saying that at all. Crowd Question:


85
0:8:26,52 --> 0:8:32,31
"I'm asking for clarification!" Roxanne: You'd
have to listen to know more about the system.


86
0:8:32,31 --> 0:8:41,62
What he's proposing is a system based on the
methods of science to..to produce abundance


87
0:8:41,62 --> 0:8:44,81
for everyone in the quickest time..without
polluting the earth. He's talking about a


88
0:8:44,81 --> 0:8:51,24
system based on..on the well-being of people
AND the environment. He's talking about a


89
0:8:51,24 --> 0:8:57,98
system that does not use money. As long as
you use money, you'll have corruption, greed,


90
0:8:57,98 --> 0:9:4,51
crime, embezzlement. So he's trying to get
rid of the root causes of the problem. We


91
0:9:4,51 --> 0:9:10,37
have enough have goods and resources to take
care of the entire population and even more


92
0:9:10,37 --> 0:9:16,0
if we use it wisely... but what we're doing
today, we're doing mass killings by starvation...


93
0:9:16,0 --> 0:9:22,64
and we're against that. We're saying we have
enough resources if we use science and technology


94
0:9:22,64 --> 0:9:30,769
to the best of our ability without the monetary
system to feed, house, and clothe everyone


95
0:9:30,769 --> 0:9:41,56
on earth. We can do that today. That's what
he's talking about. Jacque: "I'm not against


96
0:9:41,56 --> 0:9:49,279
you. Sometimes a person comes up to me and
he says, "I have 10 children." and then I


97
0:9:49,279 --> 0:9:57,769
say, "What are they for?" "What are they for?"
Just having children is not wisdom! No, I


98
0:9:57,769 --> 0:10:4,43
don't believe in depopulation, I believe in
educating the public. "Why don't you put 10,000


99
0:10:4,43 --> 0:10:9,79
people on the boat?" Cause it'll sink! The
displacement of the boat determines how many


100
0:10:9,79 --> 0:10:15,51
people you can put on it, not Fresco... and
if you wanna take a..take 400 people and put


101
0:10:15,51 --> 0:10:20,29
em' in a spaceship, it won't get off the ground.
You have to figure what the thrust is. How


102
0:10:20,29 --> 0:10:27,49
much thrust you can develop in a spaceship...
and when the government came up to scientist


103
0:10:27,49 --> 0:10:32,55
and said, "Can you put a man on the Moon?",
the first thing they said was, "I don't know."


104
0:10:32,55 --> 0:10:35,18
So i'm saying there is other ways of thinking
about things but you need help. When a man


105
0:10:35,18 --> 0:10:42,0
takes his belt off and whips his kids, "Is
he bad?" No! He doesn't know any other way


106
0:10:42,0 --> 0:10:50,38
to get to them. He says, "Do what your Daddy
says!" The kid doesn't so he whips him because


107
0:10:50,38 --> 0:10:54,94
his Daddy whipped him. He doesn't know! Now
protesting the stock exchange will not change


108
0:10:54,94 --> 0:11:1,3
anything! I hate to tell you this. I wish
it did. I'm gonna try to tell you what we


109
0:11:1,3 --> 0:11:8,1
have to do. To live in a world without war,
without poverty, without hunger and without


110
0:11:8,1 --> 0:11:15,67
most crimes... all criminals are made by this
society, by the monetary system and scarcity


111
0:11:15,67 --> 0:11:25,55
and burdens that are too big for the average
person to handle. There will be no armies,


112
0:11:25,55 --> 0:11:36,19
no navies, no prisons, and no police in a
Resource-Based Economy. Whyyy? Because it's


113
0:11:36,19 --> 0:11:42,16
just like the public library. You can access
any book you want to. Next door to the public


114
0:11:42,16 --> 0:11:50,24
library, we have a camera center, where anybody
in the community, a 7-year old kid can walk


115
0:11:50,24 --> 0:11:57,72
in and say, "I've come to check-out a camera."
Free! No fee involved. Do you understand that?


116
0:11:57,72 --> 0:12:1,389
Just like the public library. Next door to
that you'd have musical instruments, where


117
0:12:1,389 --> 0:12:7,87
anybody, like the public library, can check
out any musical instruments. The Venus Project


118
0:12:7,87 --> 0:12:14,54
is sharing all the world's resources with
all the world's people. A Resource-Based Economy


119
0:12:14,54 --> 0:12:23,29
is using resources rather than money. Making
all things available to all people... and


120
0:12:23,29 --> 0:12:30,449
if you don't do that, you'll have wars, robbery,
crimes of all kinds. Even every criminal is


121
0:12:30,449 --> 0:12:38,47
made by this culture. Once you make things
available, that's the end of crime. Do you


122
0:12:38,47 --> 0:12:48,16
understand that? Not say, "Don't steal!" As
long as you understand that people are made


123
0:12:48,16 --> 0:12:51,55
that way. When you're brought up in Australia,
you say, "I'm Australian and i'm proud of


124
0:12:51,55 --> 0:12:58,139
it." "I'm a Greek and i'm proud of it." That
divides people. If you divide people, you


125
0:12:58,139 --> 0:13:5,72
can conquer them. So what the politicians
say is things the public likes to hear. Scientists,


126
0:13:5,72 --> 0:13:10,699
not all them, some of them. When they discovered
that the Earth is round, they don't say to


127
0:13:10,699 --> 0:13:17,839
the public, "It's a little round and a little
flat." So they get along with everybody. No.


128
0:13:17,839 --> 0:13:21,57
They say, "You're wrong. It's not flat. Here's
the evidence we have to show that it's round."....


129
0:13:21,57 --> 0:13:30,55
and what you have to do is change people.
Roxanne: "We built everything ourselves. Put


130
0:13:30,55 --> 0:13:36,88
in all the windows. Instill the doors. We
Built over 400 models of the future. We didn't


131
0:13:36,88 --> 0:13:43,13
have any outside capital to do that. I did..had
a full-time job in order to support that.


132
0:13:43,13 --> 0:13:47,79
I put all the money towards that. We've put
all the money that we've made in The Venus


133
0:13:47,79 --> 0:13:52,38
Project towards that as well. If anybody knows
us, we work 7 days a week on...on promoting


134
0:13:52,38 --> 0:14:1,91
this direction. So we do have a non-profit
organization now. We are collecting donations


135
0:14:1,91 --> 0:14:7,959
for a major motion picture that we want to
do to show what a re..what life in a Resource-Based


136
0:14:7,959 --> 0:14:14,639
Economy would be like. And we live in a monetary
system. Because we are working towards a Resource-Based


137
0:14:14,639 --> 0:14:20,0
Economy the coun..county does not say, "You're
doing a great job. You don't have to pay taxes.


138
0:14:20,0 --> 0:14:21,63
You don't have to pay your electric bill.
So.." Crowd Comment: "THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING


139
0:14:21,63 --> 0:16:21,63
THAT!"
