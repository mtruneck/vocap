stripes and bright stars through the perilous


61
0:5:38,0 --> 0:5:49,5
fight, O'er the ramparts we watched, were
so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red


62
0:5:49,5 --> 0:6:1,75
glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof
through the night that our flag was still


63
0:6:1,75 --> 0:6:21,0
there; O! say does that star-spangled banner
yet wave, O'er the land of the free and the

69
0:6:56,7 --> 0:7:0,72

Candidates, I'll try to make sure each of


70
0:7:0,72 --> 0:7:5,4
you gets your fair share of questions. You'll
have one minute to answer, 30 seconds for


71
0:7:5,4 --> 0:7:10,3
follow ups and rebuttals. And I'll certainly
make sure you get time to respond if you're


72
0:7:10,3 --> 0:7:15,3
singled out for criticism. Now let's have
the candidates introduce themselves to Florida


73
0:7:15,3 --> 0:7:20,38
voters. Please keep it short. Here is an example:
I'm Wolf Blitzer and I'm thrilled to be here


74
0:7:20,38 --> 0:7:25,97
on the campus of the University of North Florida
in Jacksonville. Senator Santorum, let's begin


75
0:7:25,97 --> 0:7:26,51
with you.


76
0:7:26,51 --> 0:7:30,46
>> SANTORUM: I'm Rick Santorum, and I'm thrilled
to be here on the campus of North Florida.

>> [APPLAUSE]


79
0:7:32,99 --> 0:7:41,53
>> SANTORUM: And I'm especially thrilled because
I'm here with a North Florida resident who


80
0:7:41,53 --> 0:7:45,71
lives right down the beach from Jacksonville,
my mom, who is 93 years old, who is with me


81
0:7:45,71 --> 0:7:51,71
here tonight.


82
0:7:51,71 --> 0:7:57,46

0:7:57,46 --> 0:8:6,76
>> SANTORUM: I better just stop right there.


84
0:8:6,76 --> 0:8:13,6
>> GINGRICH: I'm Newt Gingrich, from the neighboring

85
0:8:13,6 --> 0:8:20,4
which will be the site of the next nuclear
aircraft carrier battle group.


86
0:8:20,4 --> 0:8:23,6
>> [APPLAUSE]


87
0:8:23,6 --> 0:8:30,37
>> ROMNEY: I'm Mitt Romney, and I'm pleased
to be here with my wife and my oldest son


88
0:8:30,37 --> 0:8:35,45
Tagg Romney. We're the parents of five sons,
five daughters-in-law, 16 grandkids. And it's


89
0:8:35,45 --> 0:8:40,83
great to be back in Jacksonville. Thank you.


90
0:8:40,83 --> 0:8:42,39
>> [APPLAUSE]


91
0:8:42,39 --> 0:8:51,87
>> RON PAUL: I'm Ron Paul. I'm a congressman
from Texas, 12 terms. I am the champion of


92
0:8:51,87 --> 0:8:56,89
a sound monetary system, a gold standard,
as it is under the Constitution, and a foreign


93
0:8:56,89 --> 0:9:1,37
policy based on strength which rejects the
notion that we should be the policemen of


94
0:9:1,37 --> 0:9:5,33
the world and that we should be a nation builder.


95
0:9:5,33 --> 0:9:6,94
>> [APPLAUSE]


96
0:9:6,94 --> 0:9:14,2
>> BLITZER: All right. Let's start with a
question from the audience.


97
0:9:14,2 --> 0:9:22,42
>> JONNA FLYN: Hello. Can you tell me what
specific actions you'll take to address the


98
0:9:22,42 --> 0:9:27,8
costly consequences of illegal immigration
while preserving the rights of those who seek


99
0:9:27,8 --> 0:9:28,42
to immigrate legally?


100
0:9:28,42 --> 0:9:32,81
>> BLITZER: All right. Senator Santorum, let's
take that question. But also, in the course


101
0:9:32,81 --> 0:9:37,67
of that question, express your opinion on
what we heard from Governor Romney, that self-deportation,


102
0:9:37,67 --> 0:9:42,86
or illegal immigrants leaving the country
voluntarily, is a possible solution.


103
0:9:42,86 --> 0:9:47,21
>> SANTORUM: Well, the possible solution is
-- I actually agree with Governor Romney.


104
0:9:47,21 --> 0:9:51,27
The bottom line is that we need to enforce
the laws in this country. We are a country


105
0:9:51,27 --> 0:9:56,88
of laws. People come to this country. My grandfather
came to this country because he wanted to


106
0:9:56,88 --> 0:10:3,49
come to a country that respected him. And
a country that respects you is a country that


107
0:10:3,49 --> 0:10:8,61
lives by the laws that they have. And the
first act when they come to this country,


108
0:10:8,61 --> 0:10:15,64
is to disobey a law, it's not a particularly
welcome way to enter this country. What I've


109
0:10:15,64 --> 0:10:21,38
said is from the very beginning, that we -- we
have to have a country that not only do you


110
0:10:21,38 --> 0:10:24,7
respect the law when you come here, but you
respect the law when you stay here. And people


111
0:10:24,7 --> 0:10:28,26
who have come to this country illegally have
broken the law repeatedly. If you're here,


112
0:10:28,26 --> 0:10:33,74
unless you're here on a trust fund, you've
been working illegally. You've probably stolen


113
0:10:33,74 --> 0:10:37,68
someone's Social Security number, illegally.
And so it's not just one thing that you've


114
0:10:37,68 --> 0:10:41,95
done wrong, you've done a lot of things wrong.
And as a result of that, I believe that people


115
0:10:41,95 --> 0:10:46,88
should no -- should not be able to stay here.
And so I think we need to enforce the law


116
0:10:46,88 --> 0:10:51,34
at the border, secure the border. Secondly,
we need to have employer enforcement, which


117
0:10:51,34 --> 0:10:55,71
means E-verify and then we need to have not
only employers sanctioned, but we have to


118
0:10:55,71 --> 0:10:59,5
have people who are found who are working
here illegally, they need to be deported.


119
0:10:59,5 --> 0:11:4,69
That is again the principle of having a rule
of law and living by it. I am very much in


120
0:11:4,69 --> 0:11:8,75
favor of immigration. I'm not someone -- my
dad came to this country and I'm someone who


121
0:11:8,75 --> 0:11:13,41
believes that -- that we need immigration.
We are not replacing ourselves. We have -- we


122
0:11:13,41 --> 0:11:18,4
need not only immigration for -- to keep our
population going, but we need immigration


123
0:11:18,4 --> 0:11:23,69
because immigrants bring a vitality and a
love of this country that is -- infuses this


124
0:11:23,69 --> 0:11:28,14
country with -- with great energy. And so,
I support legal immigration, but we need to


125
0:11:28,14 --> 0:11:32,25
enforce the law and in fact, if you don't
create an opportunity for people to work,


126
0:11:32,25 --> 0:11:34,8
they will leave because they can't afford
to stay here.


127
0:11:34,8 --> 0:11:40,52
>> BLITZER: Speaker Gingrich, you've suggested
that self- deportation as advocated by Governor


128
0:11:40,52 --> 0:11:44,29
Romney is in your words, "An Obama level fantasy."
Why?


129
0:11:44,29 --> 0:11:47,44
>> GINGRICH: Well look, I think that first
of all, you should control the border, which


130
0:11:47,44 --> 0:11:54,76
I have pledged to do by January 1, 2014. You
should fix legal immigration in terms of visas


131
0:11:54,76 --> 0:11:59,47
so people can come and go easily -- more easily
than doing it illegally. You should also make


132
0:11:59,47 --> 0:12:4,72
deportation easier so when you deport people
who shouldn't be here. The 13 gang members,


133
0:12:4,72 --> 0:12:9,74
for example. It should be very quick and very
clear. You should have a guest worker program,


134
0:12:9,74 --> 0:12:14,12
probably run by American Express, Visa or
MasterCard so they minimize fraud, which the


135
0:12:14,12 --> 0:12:18,14
federal government won't do. And you should
have much stronger employer penalties at that


136
0:12:18,14 --> 0:12:22,67
point because you can validate it. I actually
agree that self-deportation will occur if


137
0:12:22,67 --> 0:12:26,18
you're single. If you've only been here a
short time. And there are millions of people


138
0:12:26,18 --> 0:12:31,7
who faced with that, would go back home, file
for a guest worker program and might or might


139
0:12:31,7 --> 0:12:35,49
not come back. The one group I singled out,
were people who have been here a very long


140
0:12:35,49 --> 0:12:41,63
time who are married, who may well have children
and grandchildren. And I would just suggest


141
0:12:41,63 --> 0:12:46,88
that grandmothers or grandfathers aren't likely
to self-deport. And then you've got a question.


142
0:12:46,88 --> 0:12:51,64
I -- I offered a proposal, a citizen panel
to review whether or not somebody who had


143
0:12:51,64 --> 0:12:56,26
been here a very long time, who had family
and who had an American family willing to


144
0:12:56,26 --> 0:13:1,86
sponsor them, should be allowed to get residency,
but not citizenship so that they would be


145
0:13:1,86 --> 0:13:5,84
able to stay within the law, but would not
have any chance of becoming a citizen, unless


146
0:13:5,84 --> 0:13:10,38
they went back home. I don't think grandmothers
and grandfathers will self-deport.


147
0:13:10,38 --> 0:13:14,29
>> BLITZER: Governor Romney, the few times
and I think it was only once, that they experimented


148
0:13:14,29 --> 0:13:19,97
with self-deportation, only a handful of individuals
voluntarily left. What makes you think that


149
0:13:19,97 --> 0:13:21,629
-- that program could work?


150
0:13:21,629 --> 0:13:24,84
>> ROMNEY: Well, you've just heard the last
two speakers also indicate that they support


151
0:13:24,84 --> 0:13:28,95
the concept of self-deportation. It's very
simply this, which is for those who come into


152
0:13:28,95 --> 0:13:33,39
the country legally, they would be given an
identification card that points out they're


153
0:13:33,39 --> 0:13:38,13
able to work here and then you have an E-verify
system that's effective and efficient so that


154
0:13:38,13 --> 0:13:42,83
employers can determine who is legally here
and if employers hire someone without a card,


155
0:13:42,83 --> 0:13:48,29
or without checking to see if it's been counterfeited,
then those employers would be severely sanctioned.


156
0:13:48,29 --> 0:13:51,83
If you do that, people who have come here
illegally won't be able to find work. And


157
0:13:51,83 --> 0:13:55,54
over time, those people would tend to leave
the country, or self-deport. I don't think


158
0:13:55,54 --> 0:13:59,1
anyone is interested in going around and rounding
up people around the country and deporting


159
0:13:59,1 --> 0:14:4,23
11 million Americans -- or, excuse me 11 million
illegal immigrants into America. Now, let's


160
0:14:4,23 --> 0:14:7,62
look at -- and -- and I know people said,
but isn't that unfair to those 11 million


161
0:14:7,62 --> 0:14:11,67
that are here and have lived their lives here
and perhaps raised children here? But I think


162
0:14:11,67 --> 0:14:15,54
it's important to remember, that there are
three groups of people that are of concern


163
0:14:15,54 --> 0:14:20,43
to us. One are those that have come here illegally,
11 million. The second is the group of people


164
0:14:20,43 --> 0:14:25,9
who are brought over by coyotes and who are
in many cases abused by virtue of coming into


165
0:14:25,9 --> 0:14:29,9
this country illegally. And the third, are
the four to five million people who are waiting


166
0:14:29,9 --> 0:14:35,2
at home in their own nations trying to get
here legally. They have family members here


167
0:14:35,2 --> 0:14:39,21
asking them to come here. Grandparents and
uncles and aunts. Those are the people we


168
0:14:39,21 --> 0:14:43,38
have a responsibility for. And the second
group as well, those that are abused. We -- we're


169
0:14:43,38 --> 0:14:48,24
concerned about them. Let's focus our attention
on how to make legal immigration work and


170
0:14:48,24 --> 0:14:49,94
stop illegal immigration.


171
0:14:49,94 --> 0:14:54,6
>> BLITZER: All right. Governor Paul -- sorry,
excuse me, Congressman Paul you're from Texas.


172
0:14:54,6 --> 0:14:59,23
The state with the longest border with Mexico.
Is this a viable option, what we just heard?


173
0:14:59,23 --> 0:15:4,61
>> PAUL: Well, I'd talk about it, but I don't
see it as being very practical. I think it's


174
0:15:4,61 --> 0:15:9,39
a much bigger problem. You can't deal with
immigration without dealing with the economy.


175
0:15:9,39 --> 0:15:13,72
The weaker the economy, the more resentment
there is when illegals come in. If you have


176
0:15:13,72 --> 0:15:18,21
a healthy, vibrant economy, it's not a problem;
we're usually looking for workers. Even under


177
0:15:18,21 --> 0:15:22,39
today's circumstances, a lot of businesses
are looking for workers and they don't have


178
0:15:22,39 --> 0:15:27,1
them. They're not as well-trained here. But
also, the way we're handling our borders is


179
0:15:27,1 --> 0:15:35,7
actually hurting our economy because the businesspeople
-- you know, visitors have a hard time coming


180
0:15:35,7 --> 0:15:40,89
in. I mean, we don't have a well-managed border.
So I think we need more resources and I think


181
0:15:40,89 --> 0:15:45,87
most of the other candidates would agree we
need more resources. But where are the resources


182
0:15:45,87 --> 0:15:50,11
going to come from? I have a suggestion. I
think we spend way too much time worrying


183
0:15:50,11 --> 0:15:56,92
about the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Use some of those resources on our own border.


184
0:15:56,92 --> 0:15:57,62
>> [APPLAUSE]


185
0:15:57,62 --> 0:16:1,3
>> BLITZER: Speaker Gingrich, you had an ad,
but you pulled it this week, in which you


186
0:16:1,3 --> 0:16:6,689
described Governor Romney as the most anti-
immigrant candidate. Why did you do that?


187
0:16:6,689 --> 0:16:11,149
>> GINGRICH: Why did we describe him that
way? Because, in the original conversations


188
0:16:11,149 --> 0:16:16,779
about deportation, the position I took, which
he attacked pretty ferociously, was that grandmothers


189
0:16:16,779 --> 0:16:21,94
and grandfathers aren't going to be successfully
deported. We're not -- we as a nation are


190
0:16:21,94 --> 0:16:25,46
not going to walk into some family -- and
by the way, they're going to end up in a church,


191
0:16:25,46 --> 0:16:29,72
which will declare them a sanctuary. We're
not going to walk in there and grab a grandmother


192
0:16:29,72 --> 0:16:33,47
out and then kick them out. We're not going
-- and I think you have to be realistic in


193
0:16:33,47 --> 0:16:38,27
your indignation. I want to control the border.
I want English to be the official language


194
0:16:38,27 --> 0:16:42,689
of government. I want us to have a lot of
changes.


195
0:16:42,689 --> 0:16:43,35
>> [APPLAUSE]


196
0:16:43,35 --> 0:16:48,8
>> GINGRICH: I am prepared to be very tough
and very bold, but I'm also prepared to be


197
0:16:48,8 --> 0:16:52,899
realistic, because I've actually had to pass
legislation in Washington and I don't believe


198
0:16:52,899 --> 0:16:58,29
an unrealistic promise is going to get through,
but I do believe, if there's some level of


199
0:16:58,29 --> 0:17:3,89
humanity for people who have been here a long
time, we can pass legislation that will decisively


200
0:17:3,89 --> 0:17:8,939
reduce illegality, decisively control the
border and will once again mean the people


201
0:17:8,939 --> 0:17:10,42
who are in America are here legally.


202
0:17:10,42 --> 0:17:14,77
>> BLITZER: I just want to make sure I understand.
Is he still the most anti-immigrant candidate?


203
0:17:14,77 --> 0:17:16,63
>> GINGRICH: I think, of the four of us, yes.


204
0:17:16,63 --> 0:17:18,69
>> BLITZER: Go ahead, Governor.


205
0:17:18,69 --> 0:17:21,839
>> ROMNEY: That's simply unexcusable. That's
inexcusable. And, actually, Senator Marco


206
0:17:21,839 --> 0:17:26,62
Rubio came to my defense and said that ad
was inexcusable and inflammatory and inappropriate.


207
0:17:26,62 --> 0:17:31,309
Mr. Speaker, I'm not anti-immigrant. My father
was born in Mexico. My wife's father was born


208
0:17:31,309 --> 0:17:36,8
in Wales. They came to this country. The idea
that I'm anti-immigrant is repulsive. Don't


209
0:17:36,8 --> 0:17:40,91
use a term like that. You can say we disagree
on certain policies, but to say that enforcing


210
0:17:40,91 --> 0:17:47,809
the U.S. law to protect our borders, to welcome
people here legally, to expand legal immigration,


211
0:17:47,809 --> 0:17:53,4
as I have proved, that that's somehow anti
anti-immigrant is simply the kind of over-the-top


212
0:17:53,4 --> 0:17:58,36
rhetoric that has characterized American politics
too long. And I'm glad that Marco Rubio called


213
0:17:58,36 --> 0:18:2,5
you out on it. I'm glad you withdrew it. I
think you should apologize for it, and I think


214
0:18:2,5 --> 0:18:7,25
you should recognize that having differences
of opinions on issues does not justify labeling


215
0:18:7,25 --> 0:18:16,63
people with highly charged epithets.


216
0:18:16,63 --> 0:18:24,3
>> GINGRICH: I'll tell you what...


217
0:18:24,3 --> 0:18:24,3
>> [APPLAUSE]


218
0:18:24,3 --> 0:18:28,51
>> GINGRICH: I'll give you an opportunity
to self-describe. You tell me what language


219
0:18:28,51 --> 0:18:33,4
you would use to describe somebody who thinks
that deporting a grandmother or a grandfather


220
0:18:33,4 --> 0:18:37,5
from their family -- just tell me the language.
I'm perfectly happy for you to explain what


221
0:18:37,5 --> 0:18:38,65
language you'd use.


222
0:18:38,65 --> 0:18:42,929
>> ROMNEY: Mr. Speaker, I think I described
following the law as it exists in this country,


223
0:18:42,929 --> 0:18:46,429
which is to say, I'm not going around and
rounding people up and deporting them. What


224
0:18:46,429 --> 0:18:50,42
I said was, people who come here legally get
a work permit. People who do not come here


225
0:18:50,42 --> 0:18:55,76
legally do not get a work permit. Those who
don't get work will tend, over time, to self-deport.


226
0:18:55,76 --> 0:18:59,13
I'm not going to go find grandmothers and
take them out of their homes and deport them.


227
0:18:59,13 --> 0:19:4,2
Those are your words, not my words. And to
use that rhetoric suggests to people that


228
0:19:4,2 --> 0:19:7,929
somehow, if you're not willing to keep people
here who violated the law, that you're anti-


229
0:19:7,929 --> 0:19:13,1
immigrant. Nothing could be further from the
truth. I am pro-immigrant. I want people to


230
0:19:13,1 --> 0:19:18,3
come to America with skill and vitality and
vibrance. I want them to come legally. There


231
0:19:18,3 --> 0:19:21,92
are grandmothers that live on the other side
of the border that are waiting to come here


232
0:19:21,92 --> 0:19:27,32
legally. I want them to come here, too, not
just those that are already here.


233
0:19:27,32 --> 0:19:28,6
>> [APPLAUSE]


234
0:19:28,6 --> 0:19:37,63
>> GINGRICH: Well, so we have gone -- we've
gone from your Washington attack when I first


235
0:19:37,63 --> 0:19:42,35
proposed this and you said it was outrageous;
it would be a magnet to you're accepting the


236
0:19:42,35 --> 0:19:46,59
fact that, you know, a family is going to
take care of their grandmother or their grandfather.


237
0:19:46,59 --> 0:19:50,46
The idea that you are going to push them out
in some form by simply saying they can't go


238
0:19:50,46 --> 0:19:54,59
get a job -- I think the grandmother is still
going to be here. All I want to do is to allow


239
0:19:54,59 --> 0:20:1,42
the grandmother to be here legally with some
rights to have residency but not citizenship,


240
0:20:1,42 --> 0:20:5,94
so that he or she can finish their life with
dignity within the law.


241
0:20:5,94 --> 0:20:6,8
>> [APPLAUSE]


242
0:20:6,8 --> 0:20:16,98
>> ROMNEY: You know, our problem is not 11
million grandmothers. Our problem is -- all


243
0:20:16,98 --> 0:20:19,1
right.


244
0:20:19,1 --> 0:20:21,4
>> [APPLAUSE]


245
0:20:21,4 --> 0:20:26,929
>> ROMNEY: Our problem is 11 million people
getting jobs that many Americans, legal immigrants,


246
0:20:26,929 --> 0:20:31,42
would like to have. It's school kids in schools
that districts are having a hard time paying


247
0:20:31,42 --> 0:20:34,94
for. It's people getting free health care
because we are required under the law to provide


248
0:20:34,94 --> 0:20:39,1
that health care. And the real concern is
the people who want to come here legally.


249
0:20:39,1 --> 0:20:42,7
Let's let legal immigrants come here. Let's
stop illegal immigration.


250
0:20:42,7 --> 0:20:42,32
>> [APPLAUSE]


251
0:20:42,32 --> 0:20:47,3
>> BLITZER: The rhetoric on immigration, Governor,
has been intense, as you well know, as all


252
0:20:47,3 --> 0:20:52,86
four of you know, and anyone who watches television
knows. You had an ad running saying that Speaker


253
0:20:52,86 --> 0:20:57,48
Gingrich called Spanish "the language of the
ghetto." What do you mean by that?


254
0:20:57,48 --> 0:21:1,71
>> ROMNEY: I haven't seen the ad, so I'm sorry.
I don't get to see all the TV ads. Did he


255
0:21:1,71 --> 0:21:2,23
say that?


256
0:21:2,23 --> 0:21:3,75
>> BLITZER: Did you say that?


257
0:21:3,75 --> 0:21:7,93
>> GINGRICH: No. What I said was, we want
everybody to learn English because we don't


258
0:21:7,93 --> 0:21:12,64
-- and I didn't use the word "Spanish." We
do not want anyone trapped in a situation


259
0:21:12,64 --> 0:21:17,11
where they cannot get a commercial job, they
cannot rise, and virtually every parent of


260
0:21:17,11 --> 0:21:22,8
every ethnic group -- and by the way, they
are 94 languages spoken at the Miami-Dade


261
0:21:22,8 --> 0:21:26,549
College -- 94 languages. And that's why I
think English should be the official language


262
0:21:26,549 --> 0:21:30,46
of government, and that's why I think every
young American should learn English. And my


263
0:21:30,46 --> 0:21:35,25
point was, no one should be trapped in a linguistics
situation where they can't go out and get


264
0:21:35,25 --> 0:21:39,41
a job and they can't go out and work. So I
would say as much as Governor Romney doesn't


265
0:21:39,41 --> 0:21:43,73
particularly like my use of language, I found
his use of language and his deliberate distortion


266
0:21:43,73 --> 0:21:45,789
equally offensive.


267
0:21:45,789 --> 0:21:47,23
>> [APPLAUSE]


268
0:21:47,23 --> 0:21:54,21
>> ROMNEY: I'd like -- I doubt that's my ad,
but we'll take a look and find out. There


269
0:21:54,21 --> 0:21:57,24
are a bunch of ads out there that are being
organized by other people. But I think our


270
0:21:57,24 --> 0:22:2,59
position on English in our schools and in
our nation is the same, which I believe English


271
0:22:2,59 --> 0:22:6,23
should be the official language of the United
States, as it is. I also believe that in our


272
0:22:6,23 --> 0:22:11,69
schools, we should teach kids in English.
So, when I was governor, I fought for -- actually,


273
0:22:11,69 --> 0:22:15,88
before I was governor, I fought for, during
my election and thereafter, a program to have


274
0:22:15,88 --> 0:22:20,16
English immersion in our schools so our kids
could learn in English. I think we agree on


275
0:22:20,16 --> 0:22:23,62
this, which is, you know what? Kids in this
country should learn English so they can have


276
0:22:23,62 --> 0:22:26,27
all the jobs and all the opportunity of people
who are here.


277
0:22:26,27 --> 0:22:28,64
>> BLITZER: I want to bring Congressman Paul
and Senator Santorum into this. But let's


278
0:22:28,64 --> 0:22:35,55
take this question from Miami. CNN en Espanol's
Juan Carlos Lopez has a guest there.


279
0:22:35,55 --> 0:22:42,42
>> LOPEZ: Hola, Wolf. We're at the viewing
party for the Hispanic Leadership Network,


280
0:22:42,42 --> 0:22:46,54
and it really is a party. They are holding
their yearly conference, a meeting of Hispanic


281
0:22:46,54 --> 0:22:50,29
Republican leaders. And I'm joined by Raquel
Rodriguez. She's an attorney in Miami. She


282
0:22:50,29 --> 0:22:54,55
practices business and international law,
and she has a question for the candidates.


283
0:22:54,55 --> 0:23:1,61
>> RODRIGUEZ: Yes, good evening. The U.S.
has been largely away in its foreign and trade


284
0:23:1,61 --> 0:23:6,84
policy with Latin America. In the meantime,
Iran and China have been increasing their


285
0:23:6,84 --> 0:23:13,29
influence over an involvement in Latin America
through the leftist and left-leaning governments.


286
0:23:13,29 --> 0:23:19,1
What would each of you do as president to
more deeply engage in Latin America and, importantly,


287
0:23:19,1 --> 0:23:25,179
to support the governments and the political
parties that support democracy and free markets?


288
0:23:25,179 --> 0:23:26,24
>> BLITZER: Congressman Paul?


289
0:23:26,24 --> 0:23:31,66
>> PAUL: Well, I think free trade is the answer.
Free trade is an answer to a lot of conflicts


290
0:23:31,66 --> 0:23:35,83
around the world, so I'm always promoting
free trade. And you might add Cuba, too. I


291
0:23:35,83 --> 0:23:39,33
think we would be a lot better off with Cuba,
trading with Cuba.


292
0:23:39,33 --> 0:23:40,1
>> [APPLAUSE]


293
0:23:40,1 --> 0:23:45,26
>> PAUL: So, I think the more you can do to
promote this free trade, the better off we'll


294
0:23:45,26 --> 0:23:52,69
be. But as far as us having an obligation,
a military or a financial obligation to go


295
0:23:52,69 --> 0:23:58,95
down and dictate to them what government they
should have, I don't like that idea. I would


296
0:23:58,95 --> 0:24:5,59
work with the people and encourage free trade,
and try to set a standard here where countries


297
0:24:5,59 --> 0:24:9,51
in Central America or South America or any
place in the world would want to emulate us


298
0:24:9,51 --> 0:24:15,73
and set the standards that we have. Unfortunately,
sometimes we slip up on our standards and


299
0:24:15,73 --> 0:24:20,7
we go around the world and we try to force
ourselves on others. I don't think the nations


300
0:24:20,7 --> 0:24:24,63
in South America and Central America necessarily
want us to come down there and dictate which


301
0:24:24,63 --> 0:24:30,54
government they should have. And yet, I believe
with friendship and trade, you can have a


302
0:24:30,54 --> 0:24:36,37
lot of influence, and I strongly believe that
it's time we have friendship and trade with


303
0:24:36,37 --> 0:24:36,83
Cuba.


304
0:24:36,83 --> 0:24:37,299
>> [APPLAUSE]


305
0:24:37,299 --> 0:24:41,49
>> BLITZER: Senator Santorum, are you with
Congressman Paul?


306
0:24:41,49 --> 0:24:44,549
>> SANTORUM: No, I'm not with Congressman
Paul and I'm not with Barack Obama on this


307
0:24:44,549 --> 0:24:49,47
issue. Our policy in Central and South America
under this administration has been abysmal.


308
0:24:49,47 --> 0:24:54,48
The way we have treated, in particular, countries
like Honduras, Honduras, which stood up for


309
0:24:54,48 --> 0:24:59,809
the rule of law, which threw out a would-be
dictator who was using the Chavez playbook


310
0:24:59,809 --> 0:25:4,74
from Venezuela in order to try to run for
re-election in Honduras, and the United States


311
0:25:4,74 --> 0:25:8,809
government, instead of standing behind the
-- the people in the parliament, the people


312
0:25:8,809 --> 0:25:13,61
in the Supreme Court, who tried to enforce
the constitution of Honduras -- instead of


313
0:25:13,61 --> 0:25:18,47
siding with them, the Democrats, President
Obama sided with two other people in South


314
0:25:18,47 --> 0:25:24,76
America -- excuse me -- Central America and
South America. Chavez and Castro and Obama


315
0:25:24,76 --> 0:25:30,299
sided against the people of Honduras. This
is a consistent policy of siding with the


316
0:25:30,299 --> 0:25:35,7
leftists, siding with the Marxists, siding
with those who don't support democracy, not


317
0:25:35,7 --> 0:25:39,72
standing up for our friends in Colombia, not
standing up for our friends who want to engage


318
0:25:39,72 --> 0:25:45,299
and support America, who want to be great
trading partners and great allies for our


319
0:25:45,299 --> 0:25:50,74
country, to be able to form that kind of bond
that is so essential in our own hemisphere.


320
0:25:50,74 --> 0:25:56,179
The European Union understood how important
it was for diverse people to be able to come


321
0:25:56,179 --> 0:26:0,35
together in an economic unit. We only -- not
only have to come together as an economic


322
0:26:0,35 --> 0:26:6,9
unit, but the threat of terrorism, the threat
of Iran now in Venezuela and in other places,


323
0:26:6,9 --> 0:26:13,169
and Cuba and in Nicaragua, the threat of radical
Islam growing in that region -- is it important


324
0:26:13,169 --> 0:26:17,309
for -- it's absolutely important for us to
have a president who understands that threat


325
0:26:17,309 --> 0:26:22,799
and understands the solution is closer ties.
I will visit that area of the world, repeatedly,


326
0:26:22,799 --> 0:26:24,87
to solidify those ties when I become president.


327
0:26:24,87 --> 0:26:25,96
>> BLITZER: Let me let Congressman Paul...


328
0:26:25,96 --> 0:26:26,29
>> [APPLAUSE]


329
0:26:26,29 --> 0:26:27,299
>> BLITZER: quickly respond.


330
0:26:27,299 --> 0:26:28,36
>> [APPLAUSE]


331
0:26:28,36 --> 0:26:34,69
>> PAUL: The -- the senator mentioned standing
up for some of these nations, but he doesn't


332
0:26:34,69 --> 0:26:39,14
define it, but standing up for nations like
this usually means that we impose ourselves,


333
0:26:39,14 --> 0:26:44,72
go and pick the dictators, undermine certain
governments, also sending them a lot of money.


334
0:26:44,72 --> 0:26:50,63
It doesn't work. Most of the time, this backfires.
They resent us. We can achieve what he wants


335
0:26:50,63 --> 0:26:57,29
in a much different way than us using the
bully attitude that you will do it our way.


336
0:26:57,29 --> 0:26:58,669
This is the...


337
0:26:58,669 --> 0:26:58,859
>> [APPLAUSE]


338
0:26:58,859 --> 0:27:2,98
>> PAUL: This is not a benefit to us. And
besides, where do you get the troops and where


339
0:27:2,98 --> 0:27:7,549
are you going to get the money? Because you're
talking about force. And I -- I know of a


340
0:27:7,549 --> 0:27:10,15
much better way than using force to get along
with people.


341
0:27:10,15 --> 0:27:10,94
>> SANTORUM: I don't know where...


342
0:27:10,94 --> 0:27:11,82
>> [APPLAUSE]


343
0:27:11,82 --> 0:27:17,669
>> SANTORUM: I don't know what answer Congressman
Paul was listening to. He obviously wasn't


344
0:27:17,669 --> 0:27:20,1
listening to my answer.


345
0:27:20,1 --> 0:27:21,83
>> [APPLAUSE]


346
0:27:21,83 --> 0:27:29,32
>> SANTORUM: What I talked about is building
strong economic relationships, strong national


347
0:27:29,32 --> 0:27:33,419
security relationships. No one's talking about
force. Nobody's talking about going into Cuba


348
0:27:33,419 --> 0:27:37,7
or going into Venezuela. It's talking about
the other countries in the region, which are


349
0:27:37,7 --> 0:27:43,429
being influenced greatly by those countries,
that are tending and moving toward those militant


350
0:27:43,429 --> 0:27:47,46
socialists, instead of the United States.
Why? Because we've ignored them. You've got


351
0:27:47,46 --> 0:27:51,24
a president of the United States that held
a Colombian free trade agreement -- Colombia,


352
0:27:51,24 --> 0:27:54,87
who's out there on the front lines, working
with us against the narco- terrorists, standing


353
0:27:54,87 --> 0:28:0,5
up to Chavez in South America. And what did
we do? For political -- domestic political


354
0:28:0,5 --> 0:28:4,4
purposes, the president of the United States
sided with organized labor and the environmental


355
0:28:4,4 --> 0:28:9,36
groups and held Colombia hanging out to dry
for three years. We cannot do that to our


356
0:28:9,36 --> 0:28:10,179
friends in South America.


357
0:28:10,179 --> 0:28:10,399
>> [APPLAUSE]


358
0:28:10,399 --> 0:28:13,22
>> BLITZER: All right, we're going to -- we're
going to come back to this.


359
0:28:13,22 --> 0:28:13,44
>> [APPLAUSE]


360
0:28:13,44 --> 0:28:17,45
>> BLITZER: We're going to come back to Cuba,
as well. But stand by for that. We did double-check,


361
0:28:17,45 --> 0:28:22,25
just now, Governor, that ad that we talked
about, where I quoted you as saying that Speaker


362
0:28:22,25 --> 0:28:26,7
Gingrich called Spanish "the language of the
ghetto" -- we just double-checked. It was


363
0:28:26,7 --> 0:28:31,429
one of your ads. It's running here in Florida
in -- on the radio. And at the end you say,


364
0:28:31,429 --> 0:28:36,29
"I'm Mitt Romney and I approved this ad."
So it is -- it is here.


365
0:28:36,29 --> 0:28:37,63
>> [BOOING]


366
0:28:37,63 --> 0:28:40,74
>> ROMNEY: Let me ask -- let me ask a question.
Let me ask the speaker a question. Did you


367
0:28:40,74 --> 0:28:43,39
say what the ad says or not? I don't know.


368
0:28:43,39 --> 0:28:44,47
>> GINGRICH: It's taken totally out of context.


369
0:28:44,47 --> 0:28:45,33
>> ROMNEY: Oh, OK, he said it.


370
0:28:45,33 --> 0:28:49,98
>> GINGRICH: I did not -- no. I did not say
it about Spanish. I said, in general, about


371
0:28:49,98 --> 0:28:54,65
all languages. We are better for children
to learn English in general, period.


372
0:28:54,65 --> 0:28:55,6
>> [APPLAUSE]


373
0:28:55,6 --> 0:28:57,49
>> ROMNEY: Let's take a look at what he said.
[APPLAUSE]


374
0:28:57,49 --> 0:29:2,12
>> BLITZER: All right. We have a very important
subject, housing. Not only here in Florida,


375
0:29:2,12 --> 0:29:7,28
foreclosures really, really bad, but all over
the country. And a lot of people are wondering


376
0:29:7,28 --> 0:29:12,85
if the federal government contributed to the
housing collapse in recent years. We got a


377
0:29:12,85 --> 0:29:18,83
question that came in to us and -- let me
put it up there and I'll read it to you. "How


378
0:29:18,83 --> 0:29:23,809
would you phase out Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac? Does the private mortgage industry need


379
0:29:23,809 --> 0:29:28,369
additional regulation?" -- that from William
Schmidt. Let me start with Governor Romney.


380
0:29:28,369 --> 0:29:32,22
>> ROMNEY: Well, I think you know that Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac were a big part of why


381
0:29:32,22 --> 0:29:37,65
we have the housing crisis in the nation that
we have. And we've had this discussion before.


382
0:29:37,65 --> 0:29:43,37
Speaker Gingrich was hired by Freddie Mac
to promote them, to -- to influence other


383
0:29:43,37 --> 0:29:47,69
people throughout Washington, encouraging
them to -- not to dismantle these two entities.


384
0:29:47,69 --> 0:29:52,23
I think that was an enormous mistake. I think,
instead, we should have had a whistle-blower


385
0:29:52,23 --> 0:29:56,73
and not horn-tooter. He should have stood
up and said, look, these things are a disaster;


386
0:29:56,73 --> 0:30:1,299
this is a crisis. He should have been anxiously
telling the American people that these entities


387
0:30:1,299 --> 0:30:5,8
were causing a housing bubble that would cause
a collapse that we've seen here in Florida


388
0:30:5,8 --> 0:30:10,64
and around the country. And are they a problem
today? Absolutely. They're offering mortgages,


389
0:30:10,64 --> 0:30:14,35
again to people who can't possibly repay them.
We're creating another housing bubble, which


390
0:30:14,35 --> 0:30:18,62
will hurt the American people. The right course
for our -- for our housing industry is to


391
0:30:18,62 --> 0:30:24,419
get people back to work so they can buy homes
again. We have 9.9 percent unemployment in


392
0:30:24,419 --> 0:30:29,36
Florida. It's unthinkable, 18 percent real
unemployment here. Get people back to work.


393
0:30:29,36 --> 0:30:34,49
We'll get people into homes. Get the foreclosures
out of the system. Let people get into homes,


394
0:30:34,49 --> 0:30:38,9
rent properties if necessary and get America's
housing industry growing again.


395
0:30:38,9 --> 0:30:39,99
>> BLITZER: Speaker Gingrich?


396
0:30:39,99 --> 0:30:46,37
>> GINGRICH: Let me start by saying, Florida
is one of the two or three most hard hit states


397
0:30:46,37 --> 0:30:51,97
on foreclosures. How many of you know somebody
who has had a house foreclosed? Just raise


398
0:30:51,97 --> 0:30:53,619
your hand. Raise your hand.


399
0:30:53,619 --> 0:30:53,95
>> [APPLAUSE]


400
0:30:53,95 --> 0:30:59,8
>> GINGRICH: Okay. The governor has cheerfully
-- the governor has cheerfully attacking me


401
0:30:59,8 --> 0:31:3,7
inaccurately and he knows it. The contracts
we released from Freddie Mac said I would


402
0:31:3,7 --> 0:31:8,8
do no consulting, wrote in, no -- I mean no
lobbying, none. But this is a more interesting


403
0:31:8,8 --> 0:31:12,86
story. We began digging in after Monday night
because frankly I'd had about enough of this.


404
0:31:12,86 --> 0:31:17,89
We discovered to our shock, Governor Romney
owns shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie


405
0:31:17,89 --> 0:31:22,73
Mac. Governor Romney made a million dollars
off of selling some of that. Governor Romney


406
0:31:22,73 --> 0:31:28,169
owns share -- has an investment in Goldman
Sachs, which is today foreclosing on Floridians.


407
0:31:28,169 --> 0:31:31,9
So maybe Governor Romney in the spirit of
openness should tell us how much money he's


408
0:31:31,9 --> 0:31:38,659
made off of how many households that have
been foreclosed by his investments? And let's


409
0:31:38,659 --> 0:31:42,7
be clear about that.


410
0:31:42,7 --> 0:31:43,71
>> [APPLAUSE]


411
0:31:43,71 --> 0:31:49,24
>> ROMNEY: First of all, my investments are
not made by me. My investments for the last


412
0:31:49,24 --> 0:31:54,52
10 years have been in a blind trust, managed
by a trustee. Secondly, the investments that


413
0:31:54,52 --> 0:31:57,77
they've made, we've learned about this as
we made our financial disclosure, have been


414
0:31:57,77 --> 0:32:2,9
in mutual funds and bonds. I don't own stock
in either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. There


415
0:32:2,9 --> 0:32:8,299
are bonds that the investor has held through
mutual funds. And Mr. Speaker, I know that


416
0:32:8,299 --> 0:32:13,5
sounds like an enormous revelation, but have
you checked your own investments? You also


417
0:32:13,5 --> 0:32:17,41
have investments through mutual funds that
also invest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.


418
0:32:17,41 --> 0:32:18,7
>> [APPLAUSE]


419
0:32:18,7 --> 0:32:29,23
>> ROMNEY: Let me -- let me -- I've got more
time. Let me -- let me -- let me just -- let


420
0:32:29,23 --> 0:32:34,99
me just continue. There's a big difference
between buying like U.S. savings bonds and


421
0:32:34,99 --> 0:32:39,59
getting a return. That's a -- that's not taking
money out of the United States, that's loaning


422
0:32:39,59 --> 0:32:43,559
money to the United States. And what my trustee
did, is he loaned money to Fannie Mae and


423
0:32:43,559 --> 0:32:47,5
Freddie Mac and -- and they got paid interest
of course, just like if you buy U.S. savings


424
0:32:47,5 --> 0:32:53,27
bonds. But what the speaker did, was to work
as a spokesman to promote Fannie Mae and Freddie


425
0:32:53,27 --> 0:32:58,24
Mac. To protect them from those people that
wanted to take them down. He got paid $1.6


426
0:32:58,24 --> 0:33:2,53
million to do that. He said his first contract
indicated there would be no lobbying. But


427
0:33:2,53 --> 0:33:7,32
his second contract didn't have that prescription
taken out of it. And so you have to ask yourself


428
0:33:7,32 --> 0:33:11,82
why is that? What he was doing was clearly
promoting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in this


429
0:33:11,82 --> 0:33:17,9
case Freddie Mac to the tune of $1.6 million.
That is one of the reasons we're in the trouble


430
0:33:17,9 --> 0:33:17,62
we're in.


431
0:33:17,62 --> 0:33:18,419
>> BLITZER: Go ahead.


432
0:33:18,419 --> 0:33:21,65
>> GINGRICH: Well, first of all, you'll notice
that the governor wasn't aware of the ad he


433
0:33:21,65 --> 0:33:24,96
was running. He's not aware of the investments
that were being made in his name.


434
0:33:24,96 --> 0:33:26,94
>> ROMNEY: Of course, I can't it's a blind
trust.


435
0:33:26,94 --> 0:33:27,19
>> [CROSSTALK]


436
0:33:27,19 --> 0:33:30,36
>> GINGRICH: ...compare my investments with
his is like comparing a tiny mouse with a


437
0:33:30,36 --> 0:33:33,909
giant elephant. The fact -- the fact is...


438
0:33:33,909 --> 0:33:34,239
[APPLAUSE]


439
0:33:34,239 --> 0:33:39,83
>> GINGRICH: ...that there is a very substantial
question. You didn't give any instructions


440
0:33:39,83 --> 0:33:45,559
to -- to say, gee, let's not do this or let's
not do that? You're very quick to draw the


441
0:33:45,559 --> 0:33:51,62
widest possible exaggeration. The fact is,
the only time I ever spoke to the Congress


442
0:33:51,62 --> 0:33:56,87
about this issue was in July of 2008. The
New York Times reported it. I told the Republicans


443
0:33:56,87 --> 0:34:2,27
in the House, vote no. Do not give them any
money. They need to be reformed. And in answer


444
0:34:2,27 --> 0:34:6,76
to the question earlier, I would break each
of them up into five or six separate units.


445
0:34:6,76 --> 0:34:10,27
And over a five year period, I would wean
them from all federal sponsorship because


446
0:34:10,27 --> 0:34:12,46
we need to get away from this gigantic systems.


447
0:34:12,46 --> 0:34:14,399
>> BLITZER: Let me bring Congressman Paul,
then Senator Santorum.


448
0:34:14,399 --> 0:34:14,46
>> [APPLAUSE]


449
0:34:14,46 --> 0:34:19,489
>> BLITZER: A follow up question to you both
specifically. It seems they both acknowledge


450
0:34:19,489 --> 0:34:23,95
they both made money from Fannie and Freddie.
Should they return that money?


451
0:34:23,95 --> 0:34:27,79
>> PAUL: That -- that subject really doesn't
interest me a whole lot.


452
0:34:27,79 --> 0:34:28,619
>> [APPLAUSE]


453
0:34:28,619 --> 0:34:36,989
>> PAUL: But the question does. The -- the
question is, what are we going to do about


454
0:34:36,989 --> 0:34:41,549
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It should have
been auctioned off right after the crash came.


455
0:34:41,549 --> 0:34:43,859
It would have been cleansed by now.


456
0:34:43,859 --> 0:34:44,19
>> [APPLAUSE]


457
0:34:44,19 --> 0:34:46,169
>> PAUL: It should have been sold.


458
0:34:46,169 --> 0:34:46,5
>> [APPLAUSE]


459
0:34:46,5 --> 0:34:51,249
>> PAUL: But maybe it's my physician background,
but I think an ounce of prevention is what


460
0:34:51,249 --> 0:34:55,999
we ought to talk about so we can quit doing
this. But we know how the bubble came about.


461
0:34:55,999 --> 0:35:0,38
It was excessive credit, interest rates held
too low, too long, the Federal Reserve responsible


462
0:35:0,38 --> 0:35:4,589
for that. Community Reinvestment Act, which
is Affirmative Action telling banks they have


463
0:35:4,589 --> 0:35:10,579
to make these risky loans. And at the same
time, there was a line of credit which allowed


464
0:35:10,579 --> 0:35:17,279
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to, you know, make
more money. And it was -- it was assumed that


465
0:35:17,279 --> 0:35:23,19
they would always be protected. Now, you can't
argue. I've talked a long time about cutting


466
0:35:23,19 --> 0:35:26,229
off that credit from the Fed. I was trying
to prevent this stuff.


467
0:35:26,229 --> 0:35:26,629
>> [APPLAUSE]


468
0:35:26,629 --> 0:35:32,349
>> PAUL: Also, I opposed the Community Reinvestment
Act, as well as I had legislation in 10 years


469
0:35:32,349 --> 0:35:37,42
before the bust came to remove that line of
credit to the Treasury.


470
0:35:37,42 --> 0:35:39,25
>> BLITZER: Senator Santorum?


471
0:35:39,25 --> 0:35:43,339
>> SANTORUM: Well, I would just say, in answer
to the question, that as I mentioned last


472
0:35:43,339 --> 0:35:49,309
debate, in 2006, I went out and authored a
letter with 24 other senators asking for major


473
0:35:49,309 --> 0:35:53,819
reform of Freddie and Fannie, warning of a
meltdown and a bubble in the housing market.


474
0:35:53,819 --> 0:35:57,499
I stood out, I stood tall, and tried to get
a reform, and we couldn't do it. The reform


475
0:35:57,499 --> 0:36:3,969
we'd need is to gradually decrease the amount
of mortgage that can be financed by Freddie


476
0:36:3,969 --> 0:36:8,9
-- or underwritten by Freddie and Fannie over
time, keep reducing that until we get rid


477
0:36:8,9 --> 0:36:14,969
of Fannie and Freddie. The bigger issue here
is, these two gentlemen, who are out distracting


478
0:36:14,969 --> 0:36:18,619
from the most important issues we have been
playing petty personal politics, can we set


479
0:36:18,619 --> 0:36:24,739
aside that Newt was a member of Congress and
used the skills that he developed as a member


480
0:36:24,739 --> 0:36:28,119
of Congress to go out and advise companies
-- and that's not the worst thing in the world


481
0:36:28,119 --> 0:36:31,93
-- and that Mitt Romney is a wealthy guy because
worked hard and he's going out and working


482
0:36:31,93 --> 0:36:37,579
hard? And you guys should that alone and focus
on the issues.


483
0:36:37,579 --> 0:36:38,709
>> [APPLAUSE]


484
0:36:38,709 --> 0:36:49,829
>> BLITZER: We're going to take a quick break,
but we have a lot more to discuss. Coming


485
0:36:49,829 --> 0:37:5,859
up, the debate questions go to space, the
final frontier. Stay with us.


486
0:37:5,859 --> 0:37:8,319
>> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]


487
0:37:8,319 --> 0:37:17,509
>> BLITZER: We're continuing the debate here
in Jacksonville, Florida. Let's get to the


488
0:37:17,509 --> 0:37:21,9
issue of transparency, because voters out
there, they want to know as much about you


489
0:37:21,9 --> 0:37:26,88
four gentlemen as possible before they vote.
Tax returns -- let me bring this to Speaker


490
0:37:26,88 --> 0:37:32,39
Gingrich. Earlier this week, you said Governor
Romney, after he released his taxes, you said


491
0:37:32,39 --> 0:37:37,279
that you were satisfied with the level of
transparency of his personal finances when


492
0:37:37,279 --> 0:37:42,45
it comes to this. And I just want to reiterate
and ask you, are you satisfied right now with


493
0:37:42,45 --> 0:37:45,939
the level of transparency as far as his personal
finances?


494
0:37:45,939 --> 0:37:50,829
>> GINGRICH: Wolf, you and I have a great
relationship, it goes back a long way. I'm


495
0:37:50,829 --> 0:37:54,689
with him. This is a nonsense question.


496
0:37:54,689 --> 0:37:55,88
>> [APPLAUSE]


497
0:37:55,88 --> 0:38:4,67
>> GINGRICH: Look, how about if the four of
us agree for the rest of the evening, we'll


498
0:38:4,67 --> 0:38:6,539
actually talk about issues that relate to
governing America?


499
0:38:6,539 --> 0:38:10,509
>> BLITZER: But, Mr. Speaker, you made an
issue of this, this week, when you said that,


500
0:38:10,509 --> 0:38:15,509
"He lives in a world of Swiss bank and Cayman
Island bank accounts." I didn't say that.


501
0:38:15,509 --> 0:38:15,77
You did.


502
0:38:15,77 --> 0:38:18,969
>> GINGRICH: I did. And I'm perfectly happy
to say that on an interview on some TV show.


503
0:38:18,969 --> 0:38:22,359
But this is a national debate, where you have
a chance to get the four of us to talk about


504
0:38:22,359 --> 0:38:22,9
a whole range of issues.


505
0:38:22,9 --> 0:38:27,9
>> BLITZER: But if you make a serious accusation
against Governor Romney like that, you need


506
0:38:27,9 --> 0:38:27,819
to explain that.


507
0:38:27,819 --> 0:38:28,869
>> GINGRICH: I simply suggested --


508
0:38:28,869 --> 0:38:29,13
>> [BOOING]


509
0:38:29,13 --> 0:38:31,479
>> GINGRICH: You want to try again? I mean
--


510
0:38:31,479 --> 0:38:36,559
>> ROMNEY: Wouldn't it be nice if people didn't
make accusations somewhere else that they


511
0:38:36,559 --> 0:38:38,919
weren't willing to defend here?


512
0:38:38,919 --> 0:38:39,819
>> [APPLAUSE]


513
0:38:39,819 --> 0:38:46,65
>> GINGRICH: OK. All right. Given that standard,
Mitt, I did say I thought it was unusual.


514
0:38:46,65 --> 0:38:50,359
And I don't know of any American president
who has had a Swiss bank account. I'd be glad


515
0:38:50,359 --> 0:38:52,439
for you to explain that sort of thing.


516
0:38:52,439 --> 0:38:58,619
>> ROMNEY: OK. I will. I will. I'll say it
again. I have a trustee that manages my investments


517
0:38:58,619 --> 0:39:3,799
in a blind trust. That was so that I would
avoid any conflicts of interest. That trustee


518
0:39:3,799 --> 0:39:7,819
indicated last week, when he was asked about
this, he said that he wanted to diversify


519
0:39:7,819 --> 0:39:11,45
the investments that I had. And for awhile
he had money in a Swiss account, reported


520
0:39:11,45 --> 0:39:16,329
in the U.S., full taxes paid on it, U.S. taxes.
There's nothing wrong with that. And I know


521
0:39:16,329 --> 0:39:20,71
that there may be some who try to make a deal
of that, as you have publicly. But look, I


522
0:39:20,71 --> 0:39:24,369
think it's important for people to make sure
that we don't castigate individuals who have


523
0:39:24,369 --> 0:39:28,289
been successful and try and, by innuendo,
suggest there's something wrong with being


524
0:39:28,289 --> 0:39:32,849
successful and having investments and having
a return on those investments. Speaker, you've


525
0:39:32,849 --> 0:39:37,599
indicated that somehow I don't earn that money.
I have earned the money that I have. I didn't


526
0:39:37,599 --> 0:39:42,839
inherit it. I take risks. I make investments.
Those investments lead to jobs being created


527
0:39:42,839 --> 0:39:46,219
in America. I'm proud of being successful.
I'm proud of being in the free enterprise


528
0:39:46,219 --> 0:39:50,43
system that creates jobs for other people.
I'm not going to run from that. I'm proud


529
0:39:50,43 --> 0:39:56,289
of the taxes I pay. My taxes, plus my charitable
contributions, this year, 2011, will be about


530
0:39:56,289 --> 0:40:0,96
40 percent. So, look, let's put behind this
idea of attacking me because of my investments


531
0:40:0,96 --> 0:40:4,92
or my money, and let's get Republicans to
say, you know what? What you've accomplished


532
0:40:4,92 --> 0:40:9,209
in your life shouldn't be seen as a detriment,
it should be seen as an asset to help America.


533
0:40:9,209 --> 0:40:9,899
>> [APPLAUSE]


534
0:40:9,899 --> 0:40:17,529
>> BLITZER: Mr. Speaker, I'm ready to move
on, if you are.


535
0:40:17,529 --> 0:40:18,909
>> GINGRICH: What?


536
0:40:18,909 --> 0:40:22,49
>> BLITZER: I said I'm ready to move on to
the next subject if you are.


537
0:40:22,49 --> 0:40:26,299
>> GINGRICH: I'm happy to. I'm happy to simply
say, you know, it would be nice if you had


538
0:40:26,299 --> 0:40:30,59
the same standard for other people that you
would like applied to you and didn't enter


539
0:40:30,59 --> 0:40:34,42
into personal attacks about personal activities
about which you are factually wrong. So I


540
0:40:34,42 --> 0:40:38,99
would be glad to have a truce with you, but
it's a two-way truce.


541
0:40:38,99 --> 0:40:39,339
>> [BOOING]


542
0:40:39,339 --> 0:40:39,7
>> [APPLAUSE]


543
0:40:39,7 --> 0:40:43,579
>> ROMNEY: I'm happy on any occasion to describe
the things that I believe with regards to


544
0:40:43,579 --> 0:40:46,779
the Speaker's background. We'll probably get
a chance to do that as time goes on.


545
0:40:46,779 --> 0:40:52,499
>> BLITZER: Mr. Speaker, explain why you think
the money that he made over these many years,


546
0:40:52,499 --> 0:40:58,469
recent years, under your tax -- hold on. Mr.
Speaker, under your tax plan -- we're talking


547
0:40:58,469 --> 0:41:3,579
about taxes right now. This is substance.
Under your proposed tax plan, he would pay


548
0:41:3,579 --> 0:41:5,809
zero taxes. Explain that.


549
0:41:5,809 --> 0:41:9,7
>> GINGRICH: Well, it would depend on whether
the particular kind of payments he made were


550
0:41:9,7 --> 0:41:13,119
counted under that plan as capital gains or
whether they were counted as regular income.


551
0:41:13,119 --> 0:41:17,13
But even as regular income, he would pay about
the same. And I've said this. This is where


552
0:41:17,13 --> 0:41:21,119
I'm the opposite of Obama. I believe we need
to have somebody who fights for hardworking


553
0:41:21,119 --> 0:41:26,529
taxpayers. My interest is in reducing everybody's
tax here to 15 percent, not trying to raise


554
0:41:26,529 --> 0:41:30,46
his to the Obama level. So I proposed an alternative
flat tax --


555
0:41:30,46 --> 0:41:31,49
>> [APPLAUSE]


556
0:41:31,49 --> 0:41:35,4
>> GINGRICH: You know, I have proposed an
alternative flat tax that people could fill


557
0:41:35,4 --> 0:41:38,95
out where you could either keep the current
system -- this is what they do in Hong Kong


558
0:41:38,95 --> 0:41:42,14
-- keep the current system with all of its
deductions and all its paperwork, or you'd


559
0:41:42,14 --> 0:41:46,39
have a single page -- I earned this amount,
I have this number of dependents, here is


560
0:41:46,39 --> 0:41:52,42
15 percent. My goal is to shrink the government
to fit the revenue, not to raise the revenue


561
0:41:52,42 --> 0:41:53,9
to catch up with the government. And I'd be
happy...


562
0:41:53,9 --> 0:41:53,9
>> [APPLAUSE]


563
0:41:53,9 --> 0:42:2,65
>> Let me just say, I'd -- I would be happy
to have the Mitt Romney flat tax for every


564
0:42:2,65 --> 0:42:6,559
American to pay at that rate, and I haven't
complained about the rate he pays.


565
0:42:6,559 --> 0:42:11,15
>> BLITZER: Senator Santorum, most of the
polls, almost all of the polls, want the wealthiest


566
0:42:11,15 --> 0:42:17,79
Americans to pay more in taxes in order to
balance the budget. Why are they wrong, in


567
0:42:17,79 --> 0:42:17,929
your opinion?


568
0:42:17,929 --> 0:42:23,39
>> SANTORUM: Because we need to have as much
money funneling through this economy as possible.


569
0:42:23,39 --> 0:42:26,559
And the people who make those investments
are people who have resources and wealth,


570
0:42:26,559 --> 0:42:30,99
and we want them to deploy that wealth in
the most productive way possible. And when


571
0:42:30,99 --> 0:42:34,39
you increase tax rates and you make things
much more expensive to do -- in other words,


572
0:42:34,39 --> 0:42:39,529
the rate of return is not as profitable, then
they tend to do things like investing in -- in


573
0:42:39,529 --> 0:42:43,839
nontaxable instruments and other things that
don't employ people. And so what I believe


574
0:42:43,839 --> 0:42:47,859
is we need to reduce taxes. I don't -- look,
I'm honest. I don't reduce the higher -- top


575
0:42:47,859 --> 0:42:52,719
rate as much as these other folks do. I take
the Reagan approach. Ronald Reagan had a 28


576
0:42:52,719 --> 0:42:55,65
percent top rate. If it was good enough for
Ronald Reagan, it's good enough for me. And


577
0:42:55,65 --> 0:42:57,59
that's what we put the top rate as.


578
0:42:57,59 --> 0:42:57,199
>> [APPLAUSE]


579
0:42:57,199 --> 0:43:1,539
>> SANTORUM: And -- and we have a bottom rate
of 10 percent. I believe in a differential.


580
0:43:1,539 --> 0:43:6,709
I don't believe in a flat tax. I believe in
a simplified tax code with five deductions


581
0:43:6,709 --> 0:43:12,43
and -- and focus on simplify, creating two
rates. I disagree with Newt also on this.


582
0:43:12,43 --> 0:43:16,779
I don't believe in a zero capital gains tax
rate. I don't think you need to get to zero


583
0:43:16,779 --> 0:43:21,9
to make sure that there's an efficient deployment
of capital and investment. I think, if you


584
0:43:21,9 --> 0:43:26,349
get to zero, then, in fact, guys like Mitt
Romney, who, again, I give him -- I wish I


585
0:43:26,349 --> 0:43:28,99
made as much money as Mitt Romney, but...


586
0:43:28,99 --> 0:43:28,479
>> [APPLAUSE]


587
0:43:28,479 --> 0:43:33,289
>> SANTORUM: But -- you know, but he wouldn't
probably pay much at all in taxes. And I think


588
0:43:33,289 --> 0:43:41,219
that, as long as the tax is not one that deters
a proper investment to be able to deploy capital


589
0:43:41,219 --> 0:43:46,359
and to get jobs created, then lower rates
are better than zero when it comes to the


590
0:43:46,359 --> 0:43:47,189
issue of capital gains.


591
0:43:47,189 --> 0:43:51,209
>> BLITZER: Are you with Ronald Reagan as
far as the tax rates, as Senator Santorum


592
0:43:51,209 --> 0:43:52,89
has suggested, Congressman Paul?


593
0:43:52,89 --> 0:43:57,729
>> PAUL: No, he taxed too much. My goal is
to get rid of the 16th amendment. And the


594
0:43:57,729 --> 0:43:58,759
only way you can do that...


595
0:43:58,759 --> 0:43:59,139
>> [APPLAUSE]


596
0:43:59,139 --> 0:44:4,91
>> PAUL: The only way you can do that is not
run a welfare system and a warfare system


597
0:44:4,91 --> 0:44:11,45
in policing the world. But I do want to address
this subject about taxing the rich. That is


598
0:44:11,45 --> 0:44:16,45
not a solution. But I understand and really
empathize with the people who talk about the


599
0:44:16,45 --> 0:44:20,299
99 percent and the 1 percent. Because there's
a characteristic about what happens when you


600
0:44:20,299 --> 0:44:24,359
destroy a currency. There is a transfer of
wealth from the middle class to the wealthy.


601
0:44:24,359 --> 0:44:28,769
And this has been going on for 40 years. So
the middle class is shrinking. They are getting


602
0:44:28,769 --> 0:44:32,829
poorer and they're losing their jobs and they're
losing their houses. But Wall Street isn't


603
0:44:32,829 --> 0:44:37,59
getting poorer. And they are the ones who
are getting the bailout. So we have to address


604
0:44:37,59 --> 0:44:42,2
the bailout and the system that favors a certain
group over another group. If you don't have


605
0:44:42,2 --> 0:44:45,979
sound money and if you have a welfare state,
no matter whether the welfare state is designed


606
0:44:45,979 --> 0:44:50,719
to help the poor, you know, the welfare system
helps the wealthy. And there has been this


607
0:44:50,719 --> 0:44:57,809
transfer of wealth. So, if we could stop all
of these transfers to the wealthy class, but


608
0:44:57,809 --> 0:45:4,719
the solution isn't to tax the wealthy. If
you give an honest product and customers buy


609
0:45:4,719 --> 0:45:9,43
that product, you deserve to keep that money
and earn that money. But there's a big difference


610
0:45:9,43 --> 0:45:14,589
between those who earn money and those who
rip us off through the government and the


611
0:45:14,589 --> 0:45:15,799
monetary system.


612
0:45:15,799 --> 0:45:16,429
>> [APPLAUSE]


613
0:45:16,429 --> 0:45:25,38
>> BLITZER: Congressman Paul, you're a physician.
You're 76 years old. You would be the oldest


614
0:45:25,38 --> 0:45:30,299
president of the United States if you were
elected. Are you prepared to release your


615
0:45:30,299 --> 0:45:34,229
medical records so voters out there know what
your health is?


616
0:45:34,229 --> 0:45:34,669
>> [LAUGHTER]


617
0:45:34,669 --> 0:45:39,819
>> PAUL: Oh, obviously, because it's about
one page, if even that long. But...


618
0:45:39,819 --> 0:45:40,219
>> [LAUGHTER]


619
0:45:40,219 --> 0:45:42,179
>> PAUL: But I'm willing to...


620
0:45:42,179 --> 0:45:42,579
>> [APPLAUSE]


621
0:45:42,579 --> 0:45:47,829
>> PAUL: I'm willing to challenge any of these
gentlemen up here to a 25- mile bike ride


622
0:45:47,829 --> 0:45:53,6
any time of the day in the heat of Texas.


623
0:45:53,6 --> 0:45:53,939
>> [APPLAUSE]


624
0:45:53,939 --> 0:45:59,45
>> PAUL: And, you know -- you know, that subject
has come up and sometimes in fun but sometimes


625
0:45:59,45 --> 0:46:3,65
not in fun. But, you know, there are laws
against age discrimination, so if you push


626
0:46:3,65 --> 0:46:7,46
this too much, you better be careful.


627
0:46:7,46 --> 0:46:8,69
>> [APPLAUSE]


628
0:46:8,69 --> 0:46:12,79
>> BLITZER: I raise the question because you
remember, four years ago, the same question


629
0:46:12,79 --> 0:46:16,509
came up with John McCain and he released his
records, finally. I remember our own Dr. Sanjay


630
0:46:16,509 --> 0:46:21,69
Gupta spent hours reviewing those records.
So let me go down and ask all of you. Are


631
0:46:21,69 --> 0:46:22,89
you ready to release your medical records?


632
0:46:22,89 --> 0:46:24,109
>> ROMNEY: Happy to do so.


633
0:46:24,109 --> 0:46:28,489
>> GINGRICH: I'm happy to. And I also want
to attest I'm confident that Dr. Paul is quite


634
0:46:28,489 --> 0:46:34,549
ready to serve if he's elected. Watching him
campaign, he's in great shape.


635
0:46:34,549 --> 0:46:35,279
>> [LAUGHTER]


636
0:46:35,279 --> 0:46:36,19
>> [APPLAUSE]


637
0:46:36,19 --> 0:46:40,94
>> BLITZER: All right, we have another question
from the audience. I'll look forward to seeing


638
0:46:40,94 --> 0:46:42,119
your medical records.


639
0:46:42,119 --> 0:46:42,869
>> [LAUGHTER]


640
0:46:42,869 --> 0:46:47,759
>> BLITZER: Go ahead. Let's take a question
right now. Please introduce yourself, as well.


641
0:46:47,759 --> 0:46:51,91
>> QUESTION: Good evening. My name is Matthew
Bathel. My question is, what would your plan


642
0:46:51,91 --> 0:46:55,819
be for the future of manned space flight and
the future of NASA?


643
0:46:55,819 --> 0:46:59,749
>> BLITZER: All right, let me go to Governor
Romney on this one. An important issue, especially


644
0:46:59,749 --> 0:47:4,16
here in Florida where a lot of people have
lost their jobs as a result of the decline


645
0:47:4,16 --> 0:47:10,16
of the space program. Yesterday Speaker Gingrich
outlined a -- a pretty long plan on what to


646
0:47:10,16 --> 0:47:14,789
do about it and he said that by the end of
his second term, if he were elected president,


647
0:47:14,789 --> 0:47:18,709
there would be a permanent base on the moon.
Good idea?


648
0:47:18,709 --> 0:47:23,619
>> ROMNEY: That's an enormous expense. And
right now I want to be spending money here.


649
0:47:23,619 --> 0:47:28,69
Of course the space coast has been badly hurt
and I believe in a very vibrant and strong


650
0:47:28,69 --> 0:47:32,799
space program. To define the mission for our
space program, I'd like to bring in the -- the


651
0:47:32,799 --> 0:47:36,65
top professors that relate to space areas
and physics, the top people from industry.


652
0:47:36,65 --> 0:47:40,19
Because I want to make sure what we're doing
in space translates into commercial products.


653
0:47:40,19 --> 0:47:44,64
I want to bring in our top military experts
on space needs. And -- and finally of course,


654
0:47:44,64 --> 0:47:48,39
the -- the people from -- the administration
if I had an administration. I'd like to come


655
0:47:48,39 --> 0:47:52,739
together and talk about different options
and the cost. I'd like corporate America as


656
0:47:52,739 --> 0:47:57,819
well as the defense network and others that
could come together in a -- in a part -- in,


657
0:47:57,819 --> 0:48:2,43
if you will, a partnership basis to create
a plan that will keep our space program thriving


658
0:48:2,43 --> 0:48:6,15
and growing. I -- I believe in a manned space
program. I'd like to see whether they believe


659
0:48:6,15 --> 0:48:10,749
in the same thing. I'm not -- I'm not looking
for a -- a colony on the moon. I think the


660
0:48:10,749 --> 0:48:15,49
cost of that would be in the hundreds of billions,
if not trillions. I'd rather be rebuilding


661
0:48:15,49 --> 0:48:16,5
housing here in the U.S.


662
0:48:16,5 --> 0:48:20,199
>> BLITZER: We have a question. I want to
speaker to weigh in as well.


663
0:48:20,199 --> 0:48:20,429
>> [APPLAUSE]


664
0:48:20,429 --> 0:48:24,4
>> BLITZER: This question is related from
-- we got it from Twitter. Speaker Gingrich,


665
0:48:24,4 --> 0:48:29,16
how do you plan to create a base on the moon
while keeping taxes down in eight years?


666
0:48:29,16 --> 0:48:29,619
>> [LAUGHTER]


667
0:48:29,619 --> 0:48:32,249
>> GINGRICH: I think, look it's a great question.
You start with the question, do you really


668
0:48:32,249 --> 0:48:37,349
believe NASA in it's current form is the most
effective way of leveraging investment in


669
0:48:37,349 --> 0:48:41,99
space? We now have a bureaucracy sitting there,
which has managed to mismanage the program


670
0:48:41,99 --> 0:48:45,799
so well that in fact we have no lift vehicle.
So you almost have to wonder, what does the


671
0:48:45,799 --> 0:48:50,179
Washington office of NASA do? Does it sit
around and think space?


672
0:48:50,179 --> 0:48:50,63
>> [LAUGHTER]


673
0:48:50,63 --> 0:48:54,839
>> GINGRICH: Does it contemplate that some
day we could have a rocket? My point in the


674
0:48:54,839 --> 0:48:58,63
speech I made yesterday, which is on CSPAN
and I'd love to have all of you look at it.


675
0:48:58,63 --> 0:49:3,239
It's based on having looked at space issues
since the late 1950's when missiles and rockets


676
0:49:3,239 --> 0:49:8,739
was a separate magazine. And working with
NASA and others. I believe by the use of prizes,


677
0:49:8,739 --> 0:49:13,619
by the use of incentives, by opening up the
space port so that it's available on a ready


678
0:49:13,619 --> 0:49:19,93
basis for commercial fight, by using commonsense
for example the Atlas-V could easily be fixed


679
0:49:19,93 --> 0:49:25,239
into a man capable vehicle so you didn't have
to rely on -- on a Russian launch or a Chinese


680
0:49:25,239 --> 0:49:30,829
launch. There are many things you can do to
leverage accelerating the development of space.


681
0:49:30,829 --> 0:49:36,44
Lindbergh flew to Paris for a $25,000.00 prize.
If we had a handful of serious prizes, you'd


682
0:49:36,44 --> 0:49:40,759
see an extraordinary number of people out
there trying to get to the moon first in order


683
0:49:40,759 --> 0:49:45,119
to have billed [ph] that. And I'd like to
have an American on the moon before the Chinese


684
0:49:45,119 --> 0:49:45,92
get there.


685
0:49:45,92 --> 0:49:47,819
>> BLITZER: Senator Santorum?


686
0:49:47,819 --> 0:49:49,349
>> [APPLAUSE]


687
0:49:49,349 --> 0:49:54,759
>> SANTORUM: I -- I believe America's a frontier
nation and obviously the frontier that -- that


688
0:49:54,759 --> 0:49:59,9
we're talking about is -- is the next one,
which is space. And that we need to inspire.


689
0:49:59,9 --> 0:50:2,849
One of the big problems we have in our country
today is that young people are not getting


690
0:50:2,849 --> 0:50:8,709
involved in math and science and not dreaming
big dreams. So NASA or the space program where


691
0:50:8,709 --> 0:50:15,42
space is important, NASA is one component
that -- our -- our space defense is another


692
0:50:15,42 --> 0:50:19,259
area. I think both of -- both of which are
very, very important. I agree that we need


693
0:50:19,259 --> 0:50:24,89
to bring good minds in the private sector
much more involved in NASA than the government


694
0:50:24,89 --> 0:50:29,719
bureaucracy that we have. But let's just be
honest, we run a $1.2 trillion deficit right


695
0:50:29,719 --> 0:50:34,15
now. We're -- we're borrowing 40-cents of
every dollar. And to go out there and promise


696
0:50:34,15 --> 0:50:39,43
new programs and big ideas, that's a great
thing to maybe get votes, but it's not a responsible


697
0:50:39,43 --> 0:50:43,68
thing when you have to go out and say that
we have to start cutting programs, not talking


698
0:50:43,68 --> 0:50:48,79
about how to -- how to -- how to grow them.
We're going to cut programs. We're going to


699
0:50:48,79 --> 0:50:52,14
spend -- under my administration, we're going
to spend less money every year -- every year.


700
0:50:52,14 --> 0:50:56,44
Year, to year, to year the federal government
amount of spending will go down for four years


701
0:50:56,44 --> 0:51:1,44
until we get a balanced budget. And you can't
do that by -- by -- by grand schemes. Whether


702
0:51:1,44 --> 0:51:5,63
it's the space program or frankly whether
it's the Speaker's Social Security program,


703
0:51:5,63 --> 0:51:9,949
which will create a brand-new Social Security
entitlement. Those are things that sound good


704
0:51:9,949 --> 0:51:14,229
and maybe make big promises to people, but
we've got to be responsible in the way we


705
0:51:14,229 --> 0:51:15,279
allocate our resources.


706
0:51:15,279 --> 0:51:17,39
>> BLITZER: We're going to get to that in
a moment, but...


707
0:51:17,39 --> 0:51:17,489
>> [APPLAUSE]


708
0:51:17,489 --> 0:51:21,979
>> BLITZER: Congressman Paul, Texas, the space
program very important there as well. Where


709
0:51:21,979 --> 0:51:23,21
do you stand on this?


710
0:51:23,21 --> 0:51:27,269
>> PAUL: Well, I don't think we should go
to the moon. I think we maybe should send


711
0:51:27,269 --> 0:51:29,829
some politicians up there.


712
0:51:29,829 --> 0:51:31,239
>> [APPLAUSE]


713
0:51:31,239 --> 0:51:38,809
>> PAUL: But I went -- I went into the Air
Force in 1962 and studied aerospace medicine.


714
0:51:38,809 --> 0:51:43,219
Actually had a daydream about maybe becoming
the first physician to go into space. That


715
0:51:43,219 --> 0:51:48,269
-- that didn't occur, but I see space -- the
amount of money we spend on space, the only


716
0:51:48,269 --> 0:51:52,449
part that I would vote for is for national
defense purposes. Not to explore the moon


717
0:51:52,449 --> 0:51:57,38
and go to Mars. I think that's fantastic.
That's -- I love those ideas. But I also don't


718
0:51:57,38 --> 0:52:2,789
like the idea of building government business
partnerships. If we had a healthy economy


719
0:52:2,789 --> 0:52:8,759
and had more Bill Gateses and more Warren
Buffetts, the money would be there. It should


720
0:52:8,759 --> 0:52:12,66
be privatized, and the people who work in
the industry, if you had that, there would


721
0:52:12,66 --> 0:52:20,759
be jobs in aerospace. And I just think that
we don't need a bigger, a newer program, when


722
0:52:20,759 --> 0:52:26,17
you think of the people -- I mean, health
care or something else deserves a lot more


723
0:52:26,17 --> 0:52:33,779
priority than going to the moon. So, I would
be very reluctant, but space technology should


724
0:52:33,779 --> 0:52:38,349
be followed up to some degree for national
defense purposes, but not just for the fun


725
0:52:38,349 --> 0:52:41,499
of it and, you know, for -- you know, for
scientific --


726
0:52:41,499 --> 0:52:44,339
>> BLITZER: We're going to leave this subject,
but before we do, I want Speaker Gingrich


727
0:52:44,339 --> 0:52:48,9
to clarify what you said yesterday in that
major speech you delivered on space. You said


728
0:52:48,9 --> 0:52:54,68
that you would support a lunar colony or a
lunar base, and that if 13,000 Americans were


729
0:52:54,68 --> 0:52:59,749
living there, they would be able to apply
for U.S. statehood from the moon.


730
0:52:59,749 --> 0:53:3,709
>> GINGRICH: I was meeting Rick's desire for
grandiose ideas. But --


731
0:53:3,709 --> 0:53:5,779
>> BLITZER: That's a pretty grandiose idea.


732
0:53:5,779 --> 0:53:10,719
>> GINGRICH: But let me make just two points
about this. It is really important to go back


733
0:53:10,719 --> 0:53:17,199
and look at what John F. Kennedy said in May
of 1961 when he said, "We will go to the moon


734
0:53:17,199 --> 0:53:23,79
in this decade." No American had orbited the
Earth. The technology didn't exist. And a


735
0:53:23,79 --> 0:53:27,38
generation of young people went into science
and engineering and technology, and they were


736
0:53:27,38 --> 0:53:32,359
tremendously excited. And they had a future.
I actually agree with Dr. Paul. The program


737
0:53:32,359 --> 0:53:37,449
I envision would probably end up being 90
percent private sector, but it would be based


738
0:53:37,449 --> 0:53:41,519
on a desire to change the government rules
and change the government regulations, to


739
0:53:41,519 --> 0:53:45,39
get NASA out of the business of trying to
run rockets, and to create a system where


740
0:53:45,39 --> 0:53:49,65
it's easy for private sector people to be
engaged. I want to see us move from one launch


741
0:53:49,65 --> 0:53:54,38
occasionally to six or seven launches a day
because so many private enterprises walk up


742
0:53:54,38 --> 0:53:58,859
and say, we're prepared to go do it. But I'll
tell you, I do not want to be the country


743
0:53:58,859 --> 0:54:3,459
that having gotten to the moon first, turned
around and said, it doesn't really matter,


744
0:54:3,459 --> 0:54:8,93
let the Chinese dominate space, what do we
care? I think that is a path of national decline,


745
0:54:8,93 --> 0:54:12,179
and I am for America being a great country,
not a country in decline.


746
0:54:12,179 --> 0:54:12,339
>> [APPLAUSE]


747
0:54:12,339 --> 0:54:17,679
>> BLITZER: We're going to move on, but go
ahead, Governor Romney.


748
0:54:17,679 --> 0:54:23,719
>> ROMNEY: I spent 25 years in business. If
I had a business executive come to me and


749
0:54:23,719 --> 0:54:28,64
say they wanted to spend a few hundred billion
dollars to put a colony on the moon, I'd say,


750
0:54:28,64 --> 0:54:33,829
"You're fired." The idea that corporate America
wants to go off to the moon and build a colony


751
0:54:33,829 --> 0:54:38,99
there, it may be a big idea, but it's not
a good idea. And we have seen in politics


752
0:54:38,99 --> 0:54:42,9
-- we've seen politicians -- and Newt, you've
been part of this -- go from state to state


753
0:54:42,9 --> 0:54:47,18
and promise exactly what that state wants
to hear. The Speaker comes here to Florida,


754
0:54:47,18 --> 0:54:51,569
wants to spend untold amount of money having
a colony on the moon. I know it's very exciting


755
0:54:51,569 --> 0:54:55,749
on the Space Coast. In South Carolina, it
was a new interstate highway, and dredging


756
0:54:55,749 --> 0:54:59,299
the port in Charleston. In New Hampshire,
it was burying a power line coming in from


757
0:54:59,299 --> 0:55:4,299
Canada and building a new VHA hospital in
New Hampshire so that people don't have to


758
0:55:4,299 --> 0:55:9,439
go to Boston. Look, this idea of going state
to state and promising what people want to


759
0:55:9,439 --> 0:55:14,9
hear, promising billions, hundreds of billions
of dollars to make people happy, that's what


760
0:55:14,9 --> 0:55:27,459
got us into the trouble we're in now. We've
got to say no 
to this kind of spending.


761
0:55:27,459 --> 0:55:27,679
>> [APPLAUSE]


762
0:55:27,679 --> 0:55:30,19
>> GINGRICH: I want to make two points. First,
I thought we were a country where one of the


763
0:55:30,19 --> 0:55:34,38
purposes of candidates going around was to
actually learn about the states they campaigned


764
0:55:34,38 --> 0:55:38,4
in and actually be responsive to the needs
of the states they campaign in. For example,


765
0:55:38,4 --> 0:55:42,549
the port of Jacksonville is going to have
to be expanded because the Panama Canal is


766
0:55:42,549 --> 0:55:47,79
being widened, and I think that's useful thing
for a president to know. I think it's important


767
0:55:47,79 --> 0:55:52,68
for presidents to know about local things.
Second -- and at the other end of the state,


768
0:55:52,68 --> 0:55:56,359
the Everglades Restoration Project has to
be completed, and it's the federal government


769
0:55:56,359 --> 0:56:0,39
which has failed. But, second, in response
to what Rick said, when we balanced the budget


770
0:56:0,39 --> 0:56:6,229
with the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, and ultimately
had four consecutive balanced budgets, we


771
0:56:6,229 --> 0:56:11,329
doubled the size of the National Institutes
of Health because we set priorities. It is


772
0:56:11,329 --> 0:56:16,229
possible to do the right things in the right
order to make this a bigger, richer, more


773
0:56:16,229 --> 0:56:20,849
exciting country. You don't just have to be
cheap everywhere. You can actually have priorities


774
0:56:20,849 --> 0:56:21,729
to get things done.


775
0:56:21,729 --> 0:56:21,959
>> [APPLAUSE]


776
0:56:21,959 --> 0:56:24,249
>> BLITZER: All right. We're going to move
on. But go ahead, Ron Paul.


777
0:56:24,249 --> 0:56:27,199
>> PAUL: I want to make a quick comment, because
Newt's mentioned this quite a few times about


778
0:56:27,199 --> 0:56:31,14
balancing the budget for four times. I went
back and looked at the record. The budget


779
0:56:31,14 --> 0:56:35,849
was -- the national debt during those four
years actually went up about a trillion dollars.


780
0:56:35,849 --> 0:56:40,199
What he's talking about is, he doesn't count
the money he takes out of Social Security.


781
0:56:40,199 --> 0:56:46,9
So, Reagan nor you had a truly balanced budget
because the national debt goes up, and that's


782
0:56:46,9 --> 0:56:50,799
what we pay the interest on. So I think you've
stretched that a little bit more than you


783
0:56:50,799 --> 0:56:51,349
should have.


784
0:56:51,349 --> 0:56:51,66
>> [APPLAUSE]


785
0:56:51,66 --> 0:56:54,49
>> BLITZER: Go ahead and respond. And then
Senator Santorum.


786
0:56:54,49 --> 0:56:55,43
>> GINGRICH: No, I...


787
0:56:55,43 --> 0:56:57,94
>> BLITZER: You want to respond to Congressman
Paul?


788
0:56:57,94 --> 0:57:1,559
>> GINGRICH: No, I would just say -- I would
just say, under the system that was used,


789
0:57:1,559 --> 0:57:3,49
we were $405 billion [inaudible]...


790
0:57:3,49 --> 0:57:3,849
>> [BOOING]


791
0:57:3,849 --> 0:57:8,99
>> GINGRICH: I agree with Ron -- but let me
finish. I actually agree with you, and I propose


792
0:57:8,99 --> 0:57:12,969
that we take Social Security off budget so
no president can ever again get threaten,


793
0:57:12,969 --> 0:57:17,319
as Obama did in August, that he would not
send the check out, and you could set Social


794
0:57:17,319 --> 0:57:21,529
Security back up as a free-standing trust
fund. It does have enough money and you could


795
0:57:21,529 --> 0:57:24,49
in fact pay the checks without regard to politics
in Washington.


796
0:57:24,49 --> 0:57:25,49
>> BLITZER: Go ahead, quickly.


797
0:57:25,49 --> 0:57:25,809
>> [APPLAUSE]


798
0:57:25,809 --> 0:57:28,279
>> SANTORUM: Well, look, we just listened
to the president of the United States the


799
0:57:28,279 --> 0:57:32,39
other night completely ignore the biggest
problem facing this country when it comes


800
0:57:32,39 --> 0:57:37,719
to our financial health. We've been downgraded
as a -- as a -- as a country and the president


801
0:57:37,719 --> 0:57:42,65
of the United States completely ignored any
of the heavy work, the hard work in being


802
0:57:42,65 --> 0:57:48,29
honest with the American public about what
we have to do to get our fiscal house in order.


803
0:57:48,29 --> 0:57:51,209
And I think that's the point I would make
here. Going around and promising a whole bunch


804
0:57:51,209 --> 0:57:56,439
of new ideas and new projects and big ideas
-- that was fine. And maybe we need it; we


805
0:57:56,439 --> 0:58:0,14
can do that. I supported the doubling of the
National Institutes of Health. But we didn't


806
0:58:0,14 --> 0:58:6,789
have a $1.2 trillion deficit. We didn't -- we
weren't at over -- we are now going to reach


807
0:58:6,789 --> 0:58:12,229
$16 trillion, which is more than our whole
GDP. We were not in that situation 20, 15


808
0:58:12,229 --> 0:58:17,79
years ago. We are in a different world. We
need leaders who are going to be honest with


809
0:58:17,79 --> 0:58:21,499
the people of this country, of the problems
we have, and have bold solutions to make that


810
0:58:21,499 --> 0:58:22,869
happen. I'll do that.


811
0:58:22,869 --> 0:58:24,259
>> BLITZER: Let's continue on this subject.


812
0:58:24,259 --> 0:58:24,479
>> [APPLAUSE]


813
0:58:24,479 --> 0:58:28,93
>> BLITZER: But let's take a question from
the audience. Go ahead. Stand up and please


814
0:58:28,93 --> 0:58:29,699
introduce yourself.


815
0:58:29,699 --> 0:58:36,579
>> QUESTION: My name is Lynn Frazier and I
live here in Jacksonville. And for the Republican


816
0:58:36,579 --> 0:58:41,569
presidential candidates, my question is, I'm
currently unemployed and I found myself unemployed


817
0:58:41,569 --> 0:58:46,329
for the first time in 10 years and unable
to afford health care benefits. What type


818
0:58:46,329 --> 0:58:50,17
of hope can you promise me and others in my
position?


819
0:58:50,17 --> 0:58:50,94
>> [APPLAUSE]


820
0:58:50,94 --> 0:58:53,269
>> BLITZER: Let's ask Congressman Paul.


821
0:58:53,269 --> 0:58:59,109
>> PAUL: Well, it's a tragedy because this
is a consequence of the government being involved


822
0:58:59,109 --> 0:59:6,93
in medicine since 1965. When I was growing
up, we didn't have a whole lot, but my dad


823
0:59:6,93 --> 0:59:12,939
had a small insurance, but medical care costs
weren't that much. And you should have an


824
0:59:12,939 --> 0:59:16,999
opportunity -- medical care insurance should
be given to you as an individual, so if you're


825
0:59:16,999 --> 0:59:21,709
employed or not employed, you have -- you
just take care of that and you keep it up.


826
0:59:21,709 --> 0:59:26,699
When you lose a job, sometimes you lose your
insurance. But the cost is so high. When you


827
0:59:26,699 --> 0:59:32,319
pump money into something, like housing, cost
-- prices go up. If you pump money into education,


828
0:59:32,319 --> 0:59:37,479
the cost of education goes up. When the government
gets involved in medicine, you don't get better


829
0:59:37,479 --> 0:59:42,29
care; you get -- cost goes up and it distorts
the economy and leads to a crisis. But your


830
0:59:42,29 --> 0:59:46,719
medical care should go with you. You should
get total deduction on it. It would be so


831
0:59:46,719 --> 0:59:52,14
much less expensive. It doesn't solve every
single problem, but you're -- you're suffering


832
0:59:52,14 --> 0:59:56,979
from the consequence of way too much government
and the cost going up because government has


833
0:59:56,979 --> 1:0:3,39
inflated the cost and we have a government-created
recession, and that is a consequence of the


834
1:0:3,39 --> 1:0:3,63
business cycle.


835
1:0:3,63 --> 1:0:5,829
>> BLITZER: Speaker -- Speaker Gingrich, what
should Lynn do?


836
1:0:5,829 --> 1:0:6,45
>> [APPLAUSE]


837
1:0:6,45 --> 1:0:11,289
>> GINGRICH: Well, look, the first -- she
actually put her finger on two different problems.


838
1:0:11,289 --> 1:0:15,269
The largest challenge of this country is to
get the economy growing so she can have a


839
1:0:15,269 --> 1:0:19,9
job so it's easy for her to have insurance.
We -- we need -- and the president did nothing


840
1:0:19,9 --> 1:0:23,93
about this the other night. In fact, his proposal
on taxes would make the economy worse. We


841
1:0:23,93 --> 1:0:29,199
need to have a program which would start with,
frankly, repealing Obamacare, repealing Dodd-Frank,


842
1:0:29,199 --> 1:0:29,289
repealing Sarbanes-Oxley.


843
1:0:29,289 --> 1:0:29,329
>> [APPLAUSE]


844
1:0:29,329 --> 1:0:35,959
>> GINGRICH: And we need to give her a chance
at a job. Second, we need real health reform,


845
1:0:35,959 --> 1:0:40,49
not the Obama style, but we need health reform
that allows her to buy in. And Dr. Paul is


846
1:0:40,49 --> 1:0:43,66
right. She ought to get the same tax break
whether she buys personally or whether she


847
1:0:43,66 --> 1:0:47,88
buys through a economy. She should also be
able to buy into an association so that she's


848
1:0:47,88 --> 1:0:52,279
buying with lots of other people so it's not
single insurance, which is the most expensive


849
1:0:52,279 --> 1:0:57,119
kind. But you combine those two, reforming
the insurance system and getting the economy


850
1:0:57,119 --> 1:1:2,219
growing again so people are back at work,
you cure an awful lot of America's problems


851
1:1:2,219 --> 1:1:6,729
with those two steps, and you put her back
in a position where she's in charge of her


852
1:1:6,729 --> 1:1:9,859
life; she's not dependent on Barack Obama
to take care of her.


853
1:1:9,859 --> 1:1:10,69
>> [APPLAUSE]


854
1:1:10,69 --> 1:1:15,559
>> BLITZER: That plan work for you, Governor?
ROMNEY: Actually, what both these gentlemen


855
1:1:15,559 --> 1:1:20,229
said is pretty much spot-on. And I'd -- and
I'll add a couple of things. One, I want to


856
1:1:20,229 --> 1:1:24,689
underscore something both of them said, and
that is, right now in America, if you have


857
1:1:24,689 --> 1:1:29,9
insurance, you most likely got it through
your employer. And the reason is, your employer


858
1:1:29,9 --> 1:1:32,949
gets a deduction for you when they buy the
insurance for you. That means that, if you


859
1:1:32,949 --> 1:1:38,4
change jobs, you've got to get a new insurance
company, most likely. And if you become unemployed,


860
1:1:38,4 --> 1:1:41,999
you lose your insurance. That doesn't make
sense. And if an individual wants to own their


861
1:1:41,999 --> 1:1:46,309
own insurance, they're not part of a big group,
and so as a result they get a very high rate.


862
1:1:46,309 --> 1:1:50,4
What we should do is allow individuals to
own their own insurance and have the same


863
1:1:50,4 --> 1:1:54,38
tax treatment as companies get. You do that
and people like this young woman would be


864
1:1:54,38 --> 1:1:59,99
able to own her insurance. The rates would
be substantial lower for her buying it individually


865
1:1:59,99 --> 1:2:4,759
than if she had to buy it individually today.
Secondly, getting people to work. This president


866
1:2:4,759 --> 1:2:9,16
has failed the American people. He got up
there and gave a speech last night. It was


867
1:2:9,16 --> 1:2:13,679
like Groundhog Day all over again. He said
the same things and the same results we're


868
1:2:13,679 --> 1:2:17,979
seeing today. People are not working.


869
1:2:17,979 --> 1:2:20,679
>> [APPLAUSE]


870
1:2:20,679 --> 1:2:26,319
>> ROMNEY: And we know what it takes to put
people back to work. He said some of those


871
1:2:26,319 --> 1:2:31,79
things last night -- lowering corporate taxes,
lowering regulations, opening up all of the


872
1:2:31,79 --> 1:2:35,609
above in energy, cracking down on China. He
just doesn't do any of those things, and if


873
1:2:35,609 --> 1:2:40,449
I'm president, I will do those things and
I'll get you back to work. Thank you.


874
1:2:40,449 --> 1:2:41,149
>> [APPLAUSE]


875
1:2:41,149 --> 1:2:46,63
>> SANTORUM: All three of these folks sound
great and I agree with them. I would just


876
1:2:46,63 --> 1:2:51,559
add that health savings account, which I introduced
20 years ago with John Kasich, is really the


877
1:2:51,559 --> 1:2:55,66
fundamental reform of getting consumers back
involved in the health care system. The problem


878
1:2:55,66 --> 1:3:1,42
with the answers from Congressman Gingrich
and Governor Romney is that, well, they didn't


879
1:3:1,42 --> 1:3:7,269
always say what they're saying. Governor Romney
was the author of Romneycare, which is a top-


880
1:3:7,269 --> 1:3:13,269
down government-run health care system which,
read an article today, has 15 different items


881
1:3:13,269 --> 1:3:18,63
directly in common with Obamacare, everything
from the increase in the Medicaid program,


882
1:3:18,63 --> 1:3:24,689
not just that government is going to mandate
you buy something that's a condition of breathing,


883
1:3:24,689 --> 1:3:29,17
mandate that you buy an insurance policy,
something that Governor Romney agreed to at


884
1:3:29,17 --> 1:3:35,829
the state level, something Congressman Gingrich
for 20 years advocated, that the federal government


885
1:3:35,829 --> 1:3:42,19
can force each and every person to enter into
a private contract. Something that everyone


886
1:3:42,19 --> 1:3:47,739
now, at least up on this stage, says is radically
unconstitutional, Congressman Gingrich supported


887
1:3:47,739 --> 1:3:53,869
for 20 years. Governor Romney supported it
in the state, a state that is a -- pretty


888
1:3:53,869 --> 1:3:57,65
much a model for what Obamacare is going to
look like -- the highest health care costs


889
1:3:57,65 --> 1:4:3,459
in the country, 27 percent above the average,
average waiting time -- 94 percent of the


890
1:4:3,459 --> 1:4:7,709
people in Massachusetts are now insured, but
there was just a survey that came out and


891
1:4:7,709 --> 1:4:14,99
said one in four don't get the care they need
because of the high cost. So, you have a card,


892
1:4:14,99 --> 1:4:19,779
you're covered, but you can't get care. This
is the top-down model that both of these gentlemen


893
1:4:19,779 --> 1:4:24,92
say they're now against, but they've been
for, and it does not provide the contrast


894
1:4:24,92 --> 1:4:29,839
we need with Barack Obama if we're going to
take on that most important issue. We cannot


895
1:4:29,839 --> 1:4:34,559
give the issue of health care away in this
election. It is too foundational for us to


896
1:4:34,559 --> 1:4:35,279
win this election.


897
1:4:35,279 --> 1:4:38,39
>> BLITZER: A quick rebuttal from Speaker
Gingrich and then Governor Romney.


898
1:4:38,39 --> 1:4:38,499
>> [APPLAUSE]


899
1:4:38,499 --> 1:4:44,819
>> GINGRICH: Well, in my case, I think Rick
is lumping us together rather more than is


900
1:4:44,819 --> 1:4:49,99
accurate. If you go to healthtransformation.net,
I founded the Center for Health Transformation.


901
1:4:49,99 --> 1:4:54,17
I wrote a book in 2002 called "Saving Lives
and Saving Money." It calls for you and your


902
1:4:54,17 --> 1:4:58,849
doctor and your pharmacist and your hospital
have a relationship. I believe in something


903
1:4:58,849 --> 1:5:3,38
like patient power. I didn't advocate federal
mandates. I talked about it at a state level,


904
1:5:3,38 --> 1:5:7,369
finding a way -- which included an escape
clause that people didn't have to buy it -- finding


905
1:5:7,369 --> 1:5:11,39
a way to try to have people have insurance,
particularly for wealthy people who are simply


906
1:5:11,39 --> 1:5:17,89
free-riding on local hospitals. But the fact
is, it was a personal system, dramatically


907
1:5:17,89 --> 1:5:19,399
different than either Romneycare or the version
Rick just discussed.


908
1:5:19,399 --> 1:5:20,209
>> BLITZER: Governor Romney?


909
1:5:20,209 --> 1:5:23,9
>> ROMNEY: The system that we put in place
in our state was something we worked out with


910
1:5:23,9 --> 1:5:28,239
the labor community, the health care community,
business, and the citizens of the nation.


911
1:5:28,239 --> 1:5:33,64
We came together, it was voted by a 200-person
legislature. Only two voted no. Our system


912
1:5:33,64 --> 1:5:38,16
has a lot of flaws, a lot of things I'd do
differently. It has a lot of benefits. The


913
1:5:38,16 --> 1:5:42,569
people of the state like it by about three
to one. We consider it very different than


914
1:5:42,569 --> 1:5:47,13
Obamacare. If I were president, day one I
will take action to repeal Obamacare. It's


915
1:5:47,13 --> 1:5:51,489
bad medicine. It's bad economy. I'll repeal
it.


916
1:5:51,489 --> 1:5:52,59
>> [APPLAUSE]


917
1:5:52,59 --> 1:5:55,4
>> ROMNEY: And I believe the people -- I believe
the people of each state should be able to


918
1:5:55,4 --> 1:5:59,14
craft programs that they feel are best for
their people. I think ours is working pretty


919
1:5:59,14 --> 1:6:1,429
well. If I were governor, it would work a
heck of a lot better.


920
1:6:1,429 --> 1:6:3,609
>> BLITZER: All right. And very quickly, go
ahead.


921
1:6:3,609 --> 1:6:8,89
>> SANTORUM: What Governor Romney just said
is that government-run top-down medicine is


922
1:6:8,89 --> 1:6:13,519
working pretty well in Massachusetts and he
supports it. Now, think about what that means


923
1:6:13,519 --> 1:6:13,519
--


924
1:6:13,519 --> 1:6:14,21
>> ROMNEY: That's not what I said.


925
1:6:14,21 --> 1:6:17,64
>> SANTORUM: -- going up against Barack Obama,
who you are going to claim, well, top-down


926
1:6:17,64 --> 1:6:20,519
government-run medicine on the federal level
doesn't work and we should repeal it. And


927
1:6:20,519 --> 1:6:23,869
he's going to say, wait a minute, Governor.
You just said that top-down government-run


928
1:6:23,869 --> 1:6:29,89
medicine in Massachusetts works well. Folks,
we can't give this issue away in this election.


929
1:6:29,89 --> 1:6:34,199
It is about fundamental freedom. Whether the
United States government or even a state government


930
1:6:34,199 --> 1:6:39,789
-- you have Amendment 1 [ph] here offered
by Scott Pleitgen [ph], who, by the way, endorsed


931
1:6:39,789 --> 1:6:44,329
me today, and it's going to be on your ballot
as to whether there should be a government


932
1:6:44,329 --> 1:6:48,279
mandate here in Florida. According to Governor
Romney, that's OK. If the state does it, that's


933
1:6:48,279 --> 1:6:53,89
OK. If the state wants to enforce it, that's
OK. Those are not the clear contrasts we need


934
1:6:53,89 --> 1:6:55,65
if we're going to defeat Barack Obama and
a --


935
1:6:55,65 --> 1:6:58,279
>> BLITZER: Let's go to Miami.


936
1:6:58,279 --> 1:6:58,799
>> [APPLAUSE]


937
1:6:58,799 --> 1:6:59,329
>> [CROSSTALK]


938
1:6:59,329 --> 1:7:0,819
>> BLITZER: Very quickly.


939
1:7:0,819 --> 1:7:6,299
>> ROMNEY: Rick, I make enough mistakes in
what I say, not for you to add more mistakes


940
1:7:6,299 --> 1:7:11,529
to what I say. I didn't say I'm in favor of
top- down government-run health care, 92 percent


941
1:7:11,529 --> 1:7:16,16
of the people in my state had insurance before
our plan went in place. And nothing changes


942
1:7:16,16 --> 1:7:20,579
for them. They own the same private insurance
they had before. And for the 8 percent of


943
1:7:20,579 --> 1:7:25,89
people who didn't have insurance, we said
to them, if you can afford insurance, buy


944
1:7:25,89 --> 1:7:29,16
it yourself, any one of the plans out there,
you can choose any plan. There's no government


945
1:7:29,16 --> 1:7:34,849
plan. And if you don't want to buy insurance,
then you have to help pay for the cost of


946
1:7:34,849 --> 1:7:40,4
the state picking up your bill, because under
federal law if someone doesn't have insurance,


947
1:7:40,4 --> 1:7:44,599
then we have to care for them in the hospitals,
give them free care. So we said, no more,


948
1:7:44,599 --> 1:7:50,29
no more free riders. We are insisting on personal
responsibility. Either get the insurance or


949
1:7:50,29 --> 1:7:53,259
help pay for your care. And that was the conclusion
that we reached.


950
1:7:53,259 --> 1:7:56,589
>> SANTORUM: Does everybody in Massachusetts
have a requirement to buy health care?


951
1:7:56,589 --> 1:8:1,9
>> ROMNEY: Everyone has a requirement to either
buy it or pay the state for the cost of providing


952
1:8:1,9 --> 1:8:6,209
them free care. Because the idea of people
getting something for free when they could


953
1:8:6,209 --> 1:8:10,59
afford to care for themselves is something
that we decided in our state was not a good


954
1:8:10,59 --> 1:8:10,309
idea.


955
1:8:10,309 --> 1:8:12,299
>> SANTORUM: So, in Massachusetts...


956
1:8:12,299 --> 1:8:12,809
>> [APPLAUSE]


957
1:8:12,809 --> 1:8:18,569
>> SANTORUM: Just so I understand this, in
Massachusetts, everybody is mandated as a


958
1:8:18,569 --> 1:8:24,37
condition of breathing in Massachusetts, to
buy health insurance, and if you don't, and


959
1:8:24,37 --> 1:8:29,35
if you don't, you have to pay a fine. What
has happened in Massachusetts is that people


960
1:8:29,35 --> 1:8:34,19
are now paying the fine because health insurance
is so expensive. And you have a pre-existing


961
1:8:34,19 --> 1:8:38,92
condition clause in yours, just like Barack
Obama. So what is happening in Massachusetts,


962
1:8:38,92 --> 1:8:43,31
the people that Governor Romney said he wanted
to go after, the people that were free-riding,


963
1:8:43,31 --> 1:8:48,31
free ridership has gone up five-fold in Massachusetts.
Five times the rate it was before. Why? Because...


964
1:8:48,31 --> 1:8:49,84
>> ROMNEY: That's total, complete...


965
1:8:49,84 --> 1:8:53,83
>> SANTORUM: I'll be happy to give you the
study. Five times the rate it has gone up.


966
1:8:53,83 --> 1:8:58,98
Why? Because people are ready to pay a cheaper
fine and then be able to sign up to insurance,


967
1:8:58,98 --> 1:9:3,7
which are now guaranteed under "Romney-care,"
than pay high cost insurance, which is what


968
1:9:3,7 --> 1:9:5,58
has happened as a result of "Romney-care."


969
1:9:5,58 --> 1:9:11,14
>> ROMNEY: First of all, it's not worth getting
angry about. Secondly, the...


970
1:9:11,14 --> 1:9:12,37
>> [APPLAUSE]


971
1:9:12,37 --> 1:9:19,589
>> ROMNEY: Secondly, 98 percent of the people
have insurance. And so the idea that more


972
1:9:19,589 --> 1:9:24,13
people are free-riding the system is simply
impossible. Half of those people got insurance


973
1:9:24,13 --> 1:9:29,25
on their own. Others got help in buying the
insurance. Look, I know you don't like the


974
1:9:29,25 --> 1:9:35,77
plan that we had. I don't like the Obama plan.
His plan cuts Medicare by $500 billion. We


975
1:9:35,77 --> 1:9:41,19
didn't, of course, touch anything like that.
He raises taxes by $500 billion. We didn't


976
1:9:41,19 --> 1:9:46,48
do that. He wasn't interested in the 8 percent
of the people that were uninsured. He was


977
1:9:46,48 --> 1:9:52,0
concerned about the 100 percent of the people
of the country. "Obama-care" takes over health


978
1:9:52,0 --> 1:9:56,4
care for the American people. If I'm president
of the United States, I will stop it. And


979
1:9:56,4 --> 1:10:1,17
in debating Barack Obama, I will be able to
show that I have passion and concern for the


980
1:10:1,17 --> 1:10:5,25
people in this country that need health care,
like this young woman who asked the question.


981
1:10:5,25 --> 1:10:8,69
But I will be able to point out that what
he did was wrong. It was bad medicine, it's


982
1:10:8,69 --> 1:10:11,24
bad for the economy, and I will repeal it.


983
1:10:11,24 --> 1:10:11,7
>> [APPLAUSE]


984
1:10:11,7 --> 1:10:14,92
>> BLITZER: Let's move on, let's move on.


985
1:10:14,92 --> 1:10:20,33
>> SANTORUM: Wolf, what Governor Romney said
is just factually incorrect. Your mandate


986
1:10:20,33 --> 1:10:25,9
is no different than Barack Obama's mandate.
It is the same mandate. He takes over...


987
1:10:25,9 --> 1:10:25,349
>> [APPLAUSE]


988
1:10:25,349 --> 1:10:26,659
>> BLITZER: All right. All right.


989
1:10:26,659 --> 1:10:30,77
>> SANTORUM: You take over 100 percent, just
like he takes over 100 percent, requires the


990
1:10:30,77 --> 1:10:35,17
mandate. The same fines that you put in place
in Massachusetts are fines that he puts in


991
1:10:35,17 --> 1:10:36,75
place in the federal level. Same programs.


992
1:10:36,75 --> 1:10:38,4
>> BLITZER: Congressman Paul, who is right?


993
1:10:38,4 --> 1:10:40,16
>> PAUL: I think they're all wrong.


994
1:10:40,16 --> 1:10:41,39
>> [LAUGHTER]


995
1:10:41,39 --> 1:10:42,62
>> [APPLAUSE]


996
1:10:42,62 --> 1:10:47,73
>> PAUL: I think this -- this is a typical
result of when you get government involved,


997
1:10:47,73 --> 1:10:51,98
because all you are arguing about is which
form of government you want. They have way


998
1:10:51,98 --> 1:10:57,2
too much confidence in government sorting
this out. So, I would say there's a much better


999
1:10:57,2 --> 1:11:1,65
way. And that is allow the people to make
their decisions and not get the government


1000
1:11:1,65 --> 1:11:3,53
involved. You know, it has only been...


1001
1:11:3,53 --> 1:11:3,8
>> [APPLAUSE]


1002
1:11:3,8 --> 1:11:8,23
>> PAUL: When I started medicine, there was
no Medicare or Medicaid. And nobody was out


1003
1:11:8,23 --> 1:11:13,6
in the streets without it. Now, now people
are suffering, all the complaints going on.


1004
1:11:13,6 --> 1:11:19,39
So the government isn't our solution. So,
I'm not too happy with this type of debate,


1005
1:11:19,39 --> 1:11:26,33
trying to blame one versus the other, so,
but -- most likely we're going to continue


1006
1:11:26,33 --> 1:11:28,83
to have this problem unless we straighten
out the economy. And that means...


1007
1:11:28,83 --> 1:11:31,42
>> BLITZER: I'll give you 30 seconds, Mr.
Speaker. PAUL: ... cut the spending. And they


1008
1:11:31,42 --> 1:11:36,6
talk about these new programs and all, but
how many of the other candidates are willing


1009
1:11:36,6 --> 1:11:40,7
to cut anything? I'm willing to cut $1 trillion
out of the first year.


1010
1:11:40,7 --> 1:11:40,52
>> [APPLAUSE]


1011
1:11:40,52 --> 1:11:41,88
>> BLITZER: All right.


1012
1:11:41,88 --> 1:11:47,81
>> GINGRICH: Well, I just want to say that
I actually think if you look at what Ron Paul's


1013
1:11:47,81 --> 1:11:52,67
background is as a doctor, and you look at
medicine in the early '60s, and you look at


1014
1:11:52,67 --> 1:11:58,35
how communities solved problems, it was a
fundamentally more flexible and less expensive


1015
1:11:58,35 --> 1:12:3,29
system. And there's a lot to be said for rethinking
from the ground up, the entire approach to


1016
1:12:3,29 --> 1:12:3,74
health care.


1017
1:12:3,74 --> 1:12:5,71
>> BLITZER: Let's go to Miami. We have another
question.


1018
1:12:5,71 --> 1:12:6,17
>> [APPLAUSE]


1019
1:12:6,17 --> 1:12:10,6
>> BLITZER: CNN Espanol's Juan Carlos Lopez
is standing by. Go ahead?


1020
1:12:10,6 --> 1:12:16,6
>> LOPEZ: Yes, Wolf, our question now comes
from Jennifer Coryn [ph] she is a -- the Executive


1021
1:12:16,6 --> 1:12:21,33
Director of the Hispanic Leadership Network,
our cosponsor and she is the spouse of a Marine


1022
1:12:21,33 --> 1:12:24,92
Corps Gunnery Sargent and I believe, Jennifer,
your question has to do with the future?


1023
1:12:24,92 --> 1:12:29,48
>> QUESTION: Yes. Thank you very much and
good evening. We have many qualified, Hispanic


1024
1:12:29,48 --> 1:12:33,29
leaders. Which of our Hispanic leaders would
you consider to serve in your cabinet?


1025
1:12:33,29 --> 1:12:34,64
>> BLITZER: Senator Santorum?


1026
1:12:34,64 --> 1:12:37,96
>> SANTORUM:: Well, I mean I hate to throw
one to Florida, but obviously your Senator


1027
1:12:37,96 --> 1:12:40,6
Marco Rubio is a pretty impressive guy.


1028
1:12:40,6 --> 1:12:41,79
>> [APPLAUSE]


1029
1:12:41,79 --> 1:12:45,34
>> BLITZER: Speaker Gingrich?


1030
1:12:45,34 --> 1:12:50,2
>> GINGRICH: I think that there are a number,
and I think for example of -- of when you


1031
1:12:50,2 --> 1:12:54,48
think cabinet, I think for example of Susana
Martinez, the governor of New Mexico. You


1032
1:12:54,48 --> 1:12:58,0
know, at the cabinet level I think of somebody
like Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. I actually thought


1033
1:12:58,0 --> 1:13:2,74
about Marco Rubio on a slightly more dignified
and central role, then being in the cabinet,


1034
1:13:2,74 --> 1:13:4,74
but that's another conversation.


1035
1:13:4,74 --> 1:13:5,93
>> [APPLAUSE]


1036
1:13:5,93 --> 1:13:8,3
>> BLITZER: Governor?


1037
1:13:8,3 --> 1:13:13,19
>> ROMNEY: We -- we are blessed -- we're blessed
to have an enormous number of highly qualified


1038
1:13:13,19 --> 1:13:17,21
Hispanic-Americans in the Republican Party
and leadership right now. Brian Sandoval,


1039
1:13:17,21 --> 1:13:22,94
the governor of -- of Nevada. You mentioned
Susana Martinez in New Mexico. I -- both of


1040
1:13:22,94 --> 1:13:27,36
the Diaz-Belart brothers, one retired from
Congress, the other currently there. Ileana


1041
1:13:27,36 --> 1:13:31,48
Ros-Lehtinen, Mel Martinez is back in the
private sector. Who knows, he could be pulled


1042
1:13:31,48 --> 1:13:35,92
back. Of course, Senator Marco Rubio a -- a
terrific Hispanic- American. I -- I'm sure


1043
1:13:35,92 --> 1:13:41,52
I'm missing many, many others, but we have
a -- a remarkable -- Carlos Gutierrez, formerly


1044
1:13:41,52 --> 1:13:46,83
secretary of Commerce. These individuals can
for membership in our -- in our cabinet, I


1045
1:13:46,83 --> 1:13:51,12
believe. And -- and potentially as the -- as
the speaker indicates, other positions as


1046
1:13:51,12 --> 1:13:51,46
well.


1047
1:13:51,46 --> 1:13:55,66
>> PAUL: I -- I -- I don't have one particular
name that I'm going to bring up, but my litmus


1048
1:13:55,66 --> 1:14:1,32
test would be to get individuals, Hispanic
or otherwise to understand monetary policy


1049
1:14:1,32 --> 1:14:7,42
and understand the system. But also the Hispanic
community is especially attuned to the foreign


1050
1:14:7,42 --> 1:14:13,89
policy of non-intervention. They -- they are
more opposed to war than other communities,


1051
1:14:13,89 --> 1:14:18,35
so I would think there's plenty in the Hispanic
community that could give me good advice and


1052
1:14:18,35 --> 1:14:23,25
an understanding of why a non-intervention
foreign policy is very attractive to the Hispanic


1053
1:14:23,25 --> 1:14:23,4
people.


1054
1:14:23,4 --> 1:14:27,6
>> BLITZER: All right, gentleman stand by.
Much more to discuss. I want to take a short


1055
1:14:27,6 --> 1:14:32,56
break. We have many more topics to include
-- including this, we'll get into this a little


1056
1:14:32,56 --> 1:14:38,22
bit, what would your wife -- why would your
wife make the best first lady. I'll ask these


1057
1:14:38,22 --> 1:14:40,489
four candidates. Stay with us.


1058
1:14:40,489 --> 1:14:40,99
>> [APPLAUSE]


1059
1:14:40,99 --> 1:14:42,1
>> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]


1060
1:14:42,1 --> 1:14:48,8
>> BLITZER: I'm Wolf Blitzer. We're here in
Jacksonville for CNN's Florida Republican


1061
1:14:48,8 --> 1:14:54,65
presidential debate. Many of you are watching
online, commenting on Twitter, Facebook, at


1062
1:14:54,65 --> 1:15:1,73
CNN.com. We have many more questions for the
candidates, including one that hits close


1063
1:15:1,73 --> 1:15:11,35
to home. Stand by to find out why each man
on this stage thinks his wife would be the


1064
1:15:11,35 --> 1:15:12,86
best first lady.


1065
1:15:12,86 --> 1:15:13,87
>> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]


1066
1:15:13,87 --> 1:15:23,76
>> BLITZER: Want to get right back to the
rest of the debate, but first, on a lighter


1067
1:15:23,76 --> 1:15:29,5
subject, I want to ask each of these gentlemen
why they think their wife would make a great


1068
1:15:29,5 --> 1:15:31,65
first lady. Congressman Paul?


1069
1:15:31,65 --> 1:15:35,82
>> PAUL: Well, she's been my wife for 54 years.
And we're going to have an anniversary on


1070
1:15:35,82 --> 1:15:37,26
February 1st.


1071
1:15:37,26 --> 1:15:38,53
>> BLITZER: Congratulations.


1072
1:15:38,53 --> 1:15:44,7
>> PAUL: So -- but she's the mother of five
of our children, and she's a grandmother of


1073
1:15:44,7 --> 1:15:50,14
18 grandchildren, does an excellent job. And
she's also the author of a very famous cookbook,


1074
1:15:50,14 --> 1:15:51,42
"The Ron Paul Cookbook."


1075
1:15:51,42 --> 1:15:52,6
>> BLITZER: Governor?


1076
1:15:52,6 --> 1:15:59,28
>> ROMNEY: I've got to take a little bit more
time, a little more seriousness. My -- nothing


1077
1:15:59,28 --> 1:16:5,92
wrong with what you said -- I'm sorry. My
wife is also a mom, as I pointed out early


1078
1:16:5,92 --> 1:16:12,71
on, but in some respects, she is a real champion
and a fighter. She was diagnosed in 1998 with


1079
1:16:12,71 --> 1:16:18,19
Multiple Sclerosis, and more recently with
breast cancer. She has battled both successfully.


1080
1:16:18,19 --> 1:16:21,6
And as first lady, she will be able to reach
out to people who are also struggling and


1081
1:16:21,6 --> 1:16:28,43
suffering and will be someone who shows compassion
and care. And she's also had a passion all


1082
1:16:28,43 --> 1:16:33,4
of her adult life on helping people in troubled
situations, young women in particular, understand


1083
1:16:33,4 --> 1:16:37,42
the importance of getting married before they
have babies and encouraging people to create


1084
1:16:37,42 --> 1:16:40,239
families to raise kids in.


1085
1:16:40,239 --> 1:16:41,18
>> [APPLAUSE]


1086
1:16:41,18 --> 1:16:50,81
>> GINGRICH: Let me say, first of all, having
gotten to know them, I think all three of


1087
1:16:50,81 --> 1:16:54,63
the wives represented here would be terrific
first ladies. Callista and I have gotten to


1088
1:16:54,63 --> 1:16:57,63
know all three of them, and we think they'd
be fabulous people. So I would rather just


1089
1:16:57,63 --> 1:17:0,52
to talk about why I like Callista, and why
I'd like her to be first lady, but she's not


1090
1:17:0,52 --> 1:17:5,8
necessarily in any way better. These are wonderful
people, and they would be wonderful first


1091
1:17:5,8 --> 1:17:9,92
ladies. But Callista brings a couple of things.
One is a tremendous artistic focus. She's


1092
1:17:9,92 --> 1:17:14,31
done a video in music education, why it really
matters. She's a pianist by background, plays


1093
1:17:14,31 --> 1:17:17,96
the French horn in a community band, sings
in the choir of the Basilica of the National


1094
1:17:17,96 --> 1:17:21,35
Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. She really
cares about the arts and would bring a really


1095
1:17:21,35 --> 1:17:25,56
strong feeling for music education and for
art, and why it matters to people as part


1096
1:17:25,56 --> 1:17:29,41
of their education. She's also very patriotic
about American exceptionalism. She's had a


1097
1:17:29,41 --> 1:17:34,6
best-selling "New York Times" book, children's
book, and has really reached out to young


1098
1:17:34,6 --> 1:17:39,41
people to get them to understand America.
And she's helped produce and host seven movies


1099
1:17:39,41 --> 1:17:43,79
now, so she would bring an entire, I think,
artistic flavor. But -- and I, obviously,


1100
1:17:43,79 --> 1:17:47,71
would be thrilled to be able to hang out with
her at the White House. So it would be good.


1101
1:17:47,71 --> 1:17:52,16
>> BLITZER: And I suspect you would be. Unfortunately,
Senator Santorum, your wife is not here tonight.


1102
1:17:52,16 --> 1:17:56,79
>> SANTORUM: Yeah, she's not. She's -- she's
doing what she does incredibly well, which


1103
1:17:56,79 --> 1:18:4,48
is to be a mother to our seven children. And
she is -- she's my hero. She's someone who


1104
1:18:4,48 --> 1:18:11,18
has been, you know, well- educated. She was
a neo-natal intensive care nurse for nine


1105
1:18:11,18 --> 1:18:18,9
years at one of the most advanced nurseries
in the -- in the country. She went on to,


1106
1:18:18,9 --> 1:18:21,5
because she saw all these ethical challenges
there, so she went on and got a law degree


1107
1:18:21,5 --> 1:18:26,68
so she could -- she could deal with those
in the -- in the legal world. And then when


1108
1:18:26,68 --> 1:18:31,69
she got married, she gave that up; she walked
away and walked into something that she felt


1109
1:18:31,69 --> 1:18:36,91
called to do, which was to be a mom and to
be a wife. And we've -- we've had eight children.


1110
1:18:36,91 --> 1:18:43,27
We are blessed to be raising seven. We've
been through a lot together, losing a child,


1111
1:18:43,27 --> 1:18:48,5
having a child with a disability that we have
now, our little Bella. And the -- the amount


1112
1:18:48,5 --> 1:18:56,18
of love for these special kids is just palpable
in her. She wrote a book about our son that


1113
1:18:56,18 --> 1:19:1,3
we lost called "Letters to Gabriel," about
that ordeal that we went through. That book,


1114
1:19:1,3 --> 1:19:6,84
that little book has saved countless -- I
don't -- we know of at least hundreds of lives


1115
1:19:6,84 --> 1:19:12,46
that were saved because people read that book
and realized that the child they we're carrying


1116
1:19:12,46 --> 1:19:20,65
had the dignity to be love and nurtured irrespective
of what malady may have -- may have befallen


1117
1:19:20,65 --> 1:19:26,57
that baby in the womb. And so many children
were born and are alive today because of that


1118
1:19:26,57 --> 1:19:33,53
book. She's also written a book on manners.
That's something that I -- I -- we have seven


1119
1:19:33,53 --> 1:19:36,76
children, so we know that kids are not born
good. And...


1120
1:19:36,76 --> 1:19:37,45
>> [LAUGHTER]


1121
1:19:37,45 --> 1:19:42,6
>> SANTORUM: and so manners is very important
in our house. And she wrote a storybook because


1122
1:19:42,6 --> 1:19:46,79
there were all sorts of how-to books on manners
but there was no storybook, teaching manners


1123
1:19:46,79 --> 1:19:51,21
through, well, how Christ taught us, through
stories. And -- and that's what she did. And


1124
1:19:51,21 --> 1:19:55,2
that book has hopefully somewhat civilized
some children around this country.


1125
1:19:55,2 --> 1:19:55,22
>> [LAUGHTER]


1126
1:19:55,22 --> 1:20:3,119
>> BLITZER: Very nice. All right, let's get
back to the debate -- the debate now.


1127
1:20:3,119 --> 1:20:4,38
>> [APPLAUSE]


1128
1:20:4,38 --> 1:20:9,36
>> BLITZER: Governor Romney, you criticized
Speaker Gingrich for not being as close to


1129
1:20:9,36 --> 1:20:15,11
Ronald Reagan as he says he was. When you
ran for the Senate, you said you were, quote,


1130
1:20:15,11 --> 1:20:20,2
"You weren't trying to return to Reagan-Bush."
So the question is, do you think you can claim


1131
1:20:20,2 --> 1:20:22,68
the Reagan mantle more than Speaker Gingrich?


1132
1:20:22,68 --> 1:20:28,58
>> ROMNEY: Oh, of course not. No, I -- I was
-- at the time Ronald Reagan was -- was president,


1133
1:20:28,58 --> 1:20:34,25
I was just getting started. I went through
school, came out of school, got my first job,


1134
1:20:34,25 --> 1:20:39,48
worked my way up in a consulting company,
and then, after awhile, started a business


1135
1:20:39,48 --> 1:20:44,97
of my own. I was looking at politics from
afar and learning as time went on. I didn't


1136
1:20:44,97 --> 1:20:50,2
get involved in politics early in my life.
I instead spent my time building a business.


1137
1:20:50,2 --> 1:20:54,18
And then later, as my business had been successful
and we'd been involved in some turnaround


1138
1:20:54,18 --> 1:20:57,85
situations, some businesses in trouble that
we were able to help -- not all worked out


1139
1:20:57,85 --> 1:21:2,47
as we'd hoped, but a number did -- I got asked
to go off and help get the Salt Lake City


1140
1:21:2,47 --> 1:21:9,37
Olympics in 2002 on track and put aside my
business and went -- went to Utah. And it


1141
1:21:9,37 --> 1:21:13,53
was perhaps the greatest professional experience
of my life, going there and spending three


1142
1:21:13,53 --> 1:21:17,28
years helping getting those games on track.
I -- I happen to believe the Olympics is one


1143
1:21:17,28 --> 1:21:22,19
of the great showcases of the -- of the human
spirit that exists in the media world. And


1144
1:21:22,19 --> 1:21:26,31
it was very successful. And then -- and then,
after that, I was asked by some friends to


1145
1:21:26,31 --> 1:21:29,77
come back and run for governor, did that.
And that's when I became terribly politically


1146
1:21:29,77 --> 1:21:34,66
involved. And in that involvement, I learned
a lot of lessons. Being governor taught me


1147
1:21:34,66 --> 1:21:39,26
a lot of things. I became more conservative,
by the way, as I was governor, and found the


1148
1:21:39,26 --> 1:21:43,61
importance of lowering taxes, making it easier
for businesses to grow, the importance of


1149
1:21:43,61 --> 1:21:48,14
driving schools to be the best in the country.
Those are the things I did. And so I'm not


1150
1:21:48,14 --> 1:21:52,12
suggesting -- the speaker was a congressman
at the time Ronald Reagan was president, so


1151
1:21:52,12 --> 1:21:55,9
he -- he, of course, was closer to the Ronald
Reagan era than I.


1152
1:21:55,9 --> 1:21:58,77
>> BLITZER: Mr. Speaker, you've heard the
criticism lately that you weren't necessarily


1153
1:21:58,77 --> 1:22:2,3
as close to the president as you suggest?


1154
1:22:2,3 --> 1:22:7,9
>> GINGRICH: Well, it's increasingly interesting
to watch the Romney attack machine coordinate


1155
1:22:7,9 --> 1:22:10,45
things. And all of a sudden, today, there
are like four different articles by four different


1156
1:22:10,45 --> 1:22:15,73
people that randomly show up. The fact is,
I'm thrilled that Michael Reagan has endorsed


1157
1:22:15,73 --> 1:22:19,94
me and will be campaigning with me here in
Florida. I remember very fondly, in 1995,


1158
1:22:19,94 --> 1:22:26,55
when we were at the Goldwater Institute and
Nancy Reagan said, you know, "Barry gave Ronnie


1159
1:22:26,55 --> 1:22:32,66
the torch, and now Ronny's passing the torch
to Newt and his team in Congress. So I think


1160
1:22:32,66 --> 1:22:37,51
it's reasonable to say, and I think the governor
said it fairly, I am vastly closer to Reagan.


1161
1:22:37,51 --> 1:22:42,45
In that period the governor was an independent
business person. In '92 he was donating to


1162
1:22:42,45 --> 1:22:46,43
the Democrats for Congress and voted for Paul
Tsongas in the Democratic primary. In '94


1163
1:22:46,43 --> 1:22:49,93
running against Teddy Kennedy, he said flatly,
I don't want to go back to the Reagan-Bush


1164
1:22:49,93 --> 1:22:56,13
era, I was an independent. So there's a pretty
wide gap. Now, he's more mature. He's more


1165
1:22:56,13 --> 1:22:59,13
conservative, I accept that. I think it's
a good thing. But those of us who were in


1166
1:22:59,13 --> 1:23:3,48
the trenches fighting in the '80's, it would
be nice to be recognized for what we actually


1167
1:23:3,48 --> 1:23:7,34
did and not to have orchestrated attacks to
try to distort the history of that period.


1168
1:23:7,34 --> 1:23:11,18
>> BLITZER: Governor Romney, you can respond
please.


1169
1:23:11,18 --> 1:23:11,86
>> [APPLAUSE]


1170
1:23:11,86 --> 1:23:17,17
>> ROMNEY: Just a -- just a short clarification.
I -- I've never voted for a Democrat when


1171
1:23:17,17 --> 1:23:21,21
there was a Republican on the ballot. And
-- and in my state of Massachusetts, you could


1172
1:23:21,21 --> 1:23:25,85
register as an independent and go vote in
which -- either primary happens to be very


1173
1:23:25,85 --> 1:23:30,6
interesting. And any chance I got to vote
against Bill Clinton or Ted Kennedy, I took.


1174
1:23:30,6 --> 1:23:33,11
And so I -- I'm...


1175
1:23:33,11 --> 1:23:34,35
>> [APPLAUSE]


1176
1:23:34,35 --> 1:23:40,92
>> ROMNEY: ...I have voted -- I have always
voted for a Republican any time there was


1177
1:23:40,92 --> 1:23:45,89
a Republican on the ballot. With regards to
the Speaker's involvement in the Reagan years,


1178
1:23:45,89 --> 1:23:49,14
he can speak for himself. The Reagan Diaries
and the other histories that were written


1179
1:23:49,14 --> 1:23:54,4
at that time can lay that out as well. I -- I
-- I think, I think what he said speaks for


1180
1:23:54,4 --> 1:23:56,74
itself and I'm proud of the things I was able
to accomplish.


1181
1:23:56,74 --> 1:24:0,13
>> BLITZER: Let's take another question from
the audience. Go ahead. Please stand up and


1182
1:24:0,13 --> 1:24:0,78
give us your name?


1183
1:24:0,78 --> 1:24:4,68
>> QUESTION: Hi, my name is George Miatus
[ph], I live here in Jacksonville and when


1184
1:24:4,68 --> 1:24:9,58
I was 3-years-old I was very blessed that
my parents brought me here from Cuba. They


1185
1:24:9,58 --> 1:24:13,68
brought me here so that I could be raised
in freedom and in liberty. President Obama


1186
1:24:13,68 --> 1:24:19,38
has recently announced that he is liberalizing
trade and travel policies. What would be your


1187
1:24:19,38 --> 1:24:21,95
position as president toward the island of
Cuba?


1188
1:24:21,95 --> 1:24:22,62
>> BLITZER: Senator Santorum?


1189
1:24:22,62 --> 1:24:30,43
>> SANTORUM: I would oppose it. I've been
100 percent in support of the Cuban people


1190
1:24:30,43 --> 1:24:35,52
and their right to have a free Cuba and the
United States should stand on the side of


1191
1:24:35,52 --> 1:24:41,9
the Cuban people against these despots who
are not just reigning terror, continuing reign


1192
1:24:41,9 --> 1:24:48,8
of terror in Cuba. But now have their -- their
-- their puppet, Chavez in -- in Venezuela


1193
1:24:48,8 --> 1:24:56,35
and Noriega and Morales and it keeps -- it
keeps like a cancer growing. So the idea that


1194
1:24:56,35 --> 1:25:1,9
a president of the United States would take
the heart of the cancer that is in Central


1195
1:25:1,9 --> 1:25:9,54
and South America, and begin to reward behavior
that has spread this cancer because of our


1196
1:25:9,54 --> 1:25:14,15
dilly-dallying and our inattentiveness to
the problems in Central and South America.


1197
1:25:14,15 --> 1:25:19,73
Now, we're going to reward the secret police.
We're going to [inaudible] president of Venezuela


1198
1:25:19,73 --> 1:25:25,48
as they are in Cuba. We're going to reward
this type of thuggery, this type of Marxism


1199
1:25:25,48 --> 1:25:30,73
in our region. We're going to reward a country
that is now working with these other countries


1200
1:25:30,73 --> 1:25:37,44
to harbor and bring in Iran and the terrorist
-- the Jihadist's who want to set up missile


1201
1:25:37,44 --> 1:25:42,83
sites and to set up training camps. And so
we're going to reward this behavior by opening


1202
1:25:42,83 --> 1:25:47,739
up and liberalizing. This is the exact wrong
message at the exact wrong time.


1203
1:25:47,739 --> 1:25:48,54
>> BLITZER: Congressman Paul...


1204
1:25:48,54 --> 1:25:48,73
>> [APPLAUSE]


1205
1:25:48,73 --> 1:25:54,2
>> BLITZER: ...you said the U.S. should talk
to everyone. Imagine you're in the Oval Office,


1206
1:25:54,2 --> 1:25:58,62
you speak to Raul Castro. What would you say
to him?


1207
1:25:58,62 --> 1:26:2,71
>> PAUL: Well, I'd ask him what he called
about, you know?


1208
1:26:2,71 --> 1:26:3,9
>> [LAUGHTER]


1209
1:26:3,9 --> 1:26:8,25
>> PAUL: What was the purpose of his call?
No, I would ask him what can -- what can we


1210
1:26:8,25 --> 1:26:14,35
do to improve relations? Because I wouldn't
see them as likely to attack us. When I was


1211
1:26:14,35 --> 1:26:20,25
drafted in October of '62, that was a different
world. I mean there were nuclear weapons in


1212
1:26:20,25 --> 1:26:25,17
Cuba. That was a different story. But -- but
today to -- not to talk to them and take the


1213
1:26:25,17 --> 1:26:31,48
call and see what you can work out, helps
-- helps Castro. It hurts the people, the


1214
1:26:31,48 --> 1:26:36,52
dissidents, the people who want to overthrow
him have always had to be, you know, nationalistic


1215
1:26:36,52 --> 1:26:41,9
and unified behind the leader. So as well
intended as these sanctions are, they almost


1216
1:26:41,9 --> 1:26:46,3
inevitably backfire and they help the dictators
and hurt the people.


1217
1:26:46,3 --> 1:26:46,3
>> [APPLAUSE]


1218
1:26:46,3 --> 1:26:53,23
>> PAUL: So it's time to change. The Cold
-- the Cold War -- the Cold War is over. They're


1219
1:26:53,23 --> 1:26:59,31
not going to invade us and I just think that
a better relationship and trade relationship,


1220
1:26:59,31 --> 1:27:3,55
so many people -- I think -- I've noticed
already since I've been talking about this


1221
1:27:3,55 --> 1:27:8,32
issue the last four of five years, I think
the people have changed their mind. It's very


1222
1:27:8,32 --> 1:27:11,94
-- the American people are getting much more
open. Not nearly as frightened. And people


1223
1:27:11,94 --> 1:27:15,79
-- I don't think they see a Jihadist under
the bed every night...


1224
1:27:15,79 --> 1:27:16,2
>> [LAUGHTER]


1225
1:27:16,2 --> 1:27:22,7
>> PAUL: ...and we have to worry about that.
I think there's -- I -- I worry about overreaction,


1226
1:27:22,7 --> 1:27:25,67
over concern and lack of ability to talk to
them when they call you.


1227
1:27:25,67 --> 1:27:27,719
>> BLITZER: I want both of you to weigh in,
Governor Romney first?


1228
1:27:27,719 --> 1:27:30,429
>> ROMNEY: Two -- two major flaws with President
Obama's foreign policy.


1229
1:27:30,429 --> 1:27:30,8
>> [CROSSTALK]


1230
1:27:30,8 --> 1:27:33,4
>> BLITZER: Well what about Ron Paul's policy?


1231
1:27:33,4 --> 1:27:37,78
>> ROMNEY: Well, I'm talking about President
Obama right now. We can get back to Ron Paul


1232
1:27:37,78 --> 1:27:40,1
in a moment.


1233
1:27:40,1 --> 1:27:40,87
>> [APPLAUSE]


1234
1:27:40,87 --> 1:27:45,5
>> ROMNEY: First of all, I think the president
has largely ignored Latin America, Cuba in


1235
1:27:45,5 --> 1:27:49,38
particular, Venezuela, and other nations.
I think we have to change that dramatically.


1236
1:27:49,38 --> 1:27:54,15
I think we have to have economic initiatives
to build trade throughout Latin America, particularly


1237
1:27:54,15 --> 1:27:58,1
with Colombia and Panama, now part of free
trade agreements. I want more of that throughout


1238
1:27:58,1 --> 1:28:3,45
Latin America. But that's the first flaw,
ignoring Latin America. And number two is


1239
1:28:3,45 --> 1:28:8,15
reaching out with accommodations to some of
the world's worst actors, whether it was Putin


1240
1:28:8,15 --> 1:28:11,88
in Russia, giving him what he wanted, or Castro,
saying we're going to let you have remittances


1241
1:28:11,88 --> 1:28:16,76
coming from the U.S. to fund your future,
or relaxed trade restrictions. Throughout


1242
1:28:16,76 --> 1:28:22,4
the world, with Ahmadinejad opening an open
hand, tyrants look for weakness to take advantage.


1243
1:28:22,4 --> 1:28:26,79
That's the wrong course. The right course
for Cuba is to continue to honor Helms-Burton.


1244
1:28:26,79 --> 1:28:31,6
And if I'm president of the United States,
I will use every resource we have, short of


1245
1:28:31,6 --> 1:28:36,9
invasion and military action, Congressman
Paul. I'll use every resource we can to make


1246
1:28:36,9 --> 1:28:42,6
sure that when Fidel Castro finally leaves
this planet, that we are able to help the


1247
1:28:42,6 --> 1:28:47,58
people of Cuba enjoy freedom. They want it.
It's a God-given right. And it is our responsibility


1248
1:28:47,58 --> 1:28:51,58
to help share the gift of freedom with people
throughout the world that are seeking it.


1249
1:28:51,58 --> 1:28:51,72
>> [APPLAUSE]


1250
1:28:51,72 --> 1:28:57,17
>> BLITZER: Are you open -- Mr. Speaker, are
you open to improving relations with Cuba?


1251
1:28:57,17 --> 1:29:1,1
>> GINGRICH: Well, let me start with where
the governor correctly pointed out. I was


1252
1:29:1,1 --> 1:29:6,22
very proud as Speaker to be able to make sure
that the Helms-Burton Act passed, and I'm


1253
1:29:6,22 --> 1:29:10,12
delighted that Congressman Dan Burton is here
tonight and is campaigning with me, because


1254
1:29:10,12 --> 1:29:15,9
it was a very important step towards isolating
the Castro regime. I think it's amazing that


1255
1:29:15,9 --> 1:29:20,8
Barack Obama is worried about an Arab Spring,
he's worried about Tunisia, he's worried about


1256
1:29:20,8 --> 1:29:25,13
Libya, he's worried about Egypt, he's worried
about Syria, and he cannot bring himself to


1257
1:29:25,13 --> 1:29:31,24
look south and imagine a Cuban Spring. And
I would argue that we should have, as a stated


1258
1:29:31,24 --> 1:29:36,57
explicit policy, that we want to facilitate
the transition from the dictatorship to freedom.


1259
1:29:36,57 --> 1:29:41,3
We want to bring together every non-military
asset we have, exactly as President Reagan


1260
1:29:41,3 --> 1:29:46,9
and Prime Minister Thatcher and Pope John
Paul II did in Poland and in Eastern Europe.


1261
1:29:46,9 --> 1:29:51,26
They broke up the Soviet empire without a
general war by using a wide range of things,


1262
1:29:51,26 --> 1:29:55,72
one of which is just psychological, saying
to the next generation of people in Cuba,


1263
1:29:55,72 --> 1:30:0,92
the dictatorship is not going to survive.
You need to bet to moving to freedom in order


1264
1:30:0,92 --> 1:30:5,7
to have prosperity in Cuba, and we will help
you get to that freedom.


1265
1:30:5,7 --> 1:30:5,46
>> [APPLAUSE]


1266
1:30:5,46 --> 1:30:10,4
>> BLITZER: Let's take another question from
the audience. Please give us your name and


1267
1:30:10,4 --> 1:30:11,77
tell us where you are from.


1268
1:30:11,77 --> 1:30:17,56
>> [QUESTION]: Abraham Hassel [ph] from Jacksonville,
Florida. How would a Republican administration


1269
1:30:17,56 --> 1:30:23,67
help bring peace to Palestine and Israel when
most candidates barely recognize the existence


1270
1:30:23,67 --> 1:30:30,46
of Palestine or its people? As a Palestinian-American
Republican, I'm here to tell you we do exist.


1271
1:30:30,46 --> 1:30:35,9
>> BLITZER: All right. Let's ask Governor
Romney, first of all. What would you say to


1272
1:30:35,9 --> 1:30:35,639
Abraham?


1273
1:30:35,639 --> 1:30:41,29
>> ROMNEY: Well, the reason that there's not
peace between the Palestinians and Israel


1274
1:30:41,29 --> 1:30:46,55
is because there is -- in the leadership of
the Palestinian people are Hamas and others


1275
1:30:46,55 --> 1:30:51,69
who think like Hamas, who have as their intent
the elimination of Israel. And whether it's


1276
1:30:51,69 --> 1:30:55,79
in school books that teach how to kill Jews,
or whether it's in the political discourse


1277
1:30:55,79 --> 1:31:2,19
that is spoken either from Fatah or from Hamas,
there is a belief that the Jewish people do


1278
1:31:2,19 --> 1:31:7,21
not have a right to have a Jewish state. There
are some people who say, should we have a


1279
1:31:7,21 --> 1:31:11,89
two-state solution? And the Israelis would
be happy to have a two-state solution. It's


1280
1:31:11,89 --> 1:31:14,98
the Palestinians who don't want a two-state
solution. They want to eliminate the state


1281
1:31:14,98 --> 1:31:18,74
of Israel. And I believe America must say
-- and the best way to have peace in the Middle


1282
1:31:18,74 --> 1:31:24,47
East is not for us to vacillate and to appease,
but is to say, we stand with our friend Israel.


1283
1:31:24,47 --> 1:31:29,11
We are committed to a Jewish state in Israel.
We will not have an inch of difference between


1284
1:31:29,11 --> 1:31:34,27
ourselves and our ally, Israel. This president
went before the United Nations and castigated


1285
1:31:34,27 --> 1:31:38,9
Israel for building settlements. He said nothing
about thousands of rockets being rained in


1286
1:31:38,9 --> 1:31:44,31
on Israel from the Gaza Strip. This president
threw --


1287
1:31:44,31 --> 1:31:46,76
>> [APPLAUSE]


1288
1:31:46,76 --> 1:31:55,53
>> ROMNEY: I think he threw Israel under the
bus with regards to defining the '67 borders


1289
1:31:55,53 --> 1:32:2,71
as a starting point of negotiations. I think
he disrespected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.


1290
1:32:2,71 --> 1:32:7,46
I think he has time and time again shown distance
from Israel, and that has created, in my view,


1291
1:32:7,46 --> 1:32:11,27
a greater sense of aggression on the part
of the Palestinians. I will stand with our


1292
1:32:11,27 --> 1:32:12,2
friend, Israel.


1293
1:32:12,2 --> 1:32:12,949
>> BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.


1294
1:32:12,949 --> 1:32:13,23
>> [APPLAUSE]


1295
1:32:13,23 --> 1:32:17,7
>> BLITZER: Speaker Gingrich, you got into
a little hot water when you said the Palestinians


1296
1:32:17,7 --> 1:32:23,18
were an invented people. GINGRICH: It was
technically an invention of the late 1970s,


1297
1:32:23,18 --> 1:32:27,58
and it was clearly so. Prior to that, they
were Arabs. Many of them were either Syrian,


1298
1:32:27,58 --> 1:32:33,56
Lebanese, or Egyptian, or Jordanian. There
are a couple of simple things here. There


1299
1:32:33,56 --> 1:32:42,0
were 11 rockets fired into Israel in November.
Now, imagine in Duvall County that 11 rockets


1300
1:32:42,0 --> 1:32:48,3
hit from your neighbor. How many of you would
be for a peace process and how many of you


1301
1:32:48,3 --> 1:32:52,75
would say, you know, that looks like an act
of war. You have leadership unequivocally,


1302
1:32:52,75 --> 1:32:56,76
and Governor Romney is exactly right, the
leadership of Hamas says, not a single Jew


1303
1:32:56,76 --> 1:33:2,61
will remain. We aren't having a peace negotiation
then. This is war by another form. My goal


1304
1:33:2,61 --> 1:33:7,9
for the Palestinian people would be to live
in peace, to live in prosperity, to have the


1305
1:33:7,9 --> 1:33:12,8
dignity of a state, to have freedom. and they
can achieve it any morning they are prepared


1306
1:33:12,8 --> 1:33:18,18
to say Israel has a right to exist, we give
up the right to return, and we recognize that


1307
1:33:18,18 --> 1:33:22,53
we're going to live side-by-side, now let's
work together to create mutual prosperity.


1308
1:33:22,53 --> 1:33:27,38
And you could in five years dramatically improve
the quality of life of every Palestinian.


1309
1:33:27,38 --> 1:33:32,15
But the political leadership would never tolerate
that. And that's why we're in a continuous


1310
1:33:32,15 --> 1:33:37,48
state of war where Obama undermines the Israelis.
On the first day that I'm president, if I


1311
1:33:37,48 --> 1:33:42,15
do become president, I will sign an executive
order directing the State Department to move


1312
1:33:42,15 --> 1:33:46,27
the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to
send the signal we're with Israel.


1313
1:33:46,27 --> 1:33:46,61
>> [APPLAUSE]


1314
1:33:46,61 --> 1:33:52,64
>> BLITZER: Let's go to Miami. Let's take
another question from Miami. Juan Carlos,


1315
1:33:52,64 --> 1:33:54,67
go ahead?


1316
1:33:54,67 --> 1:33:59,71
>> LOPEZ: Thank you, Wolf. I'm joined now
by Elizabeth Cuevas- Neunder. She is the CEO


1317
1:33:59,71 --> 1:34:4,42
and founder of the Puerto Rican Chamber of
Commerce in Florida. She is based out of Tampa.


1318
1:34:4,42 --> 1:34:8,17
And I'm pretty sure, Elizabeth, your question
has to do with the beautiful island of Puerto


1319
1:34:8,17 --> 1:34:8,55
Rico.


1320
1:34:8,55 --> 1:34:13,48
>> ELIZABETH CUEVAS: [SPEAKING IN SPANISH].
Good evening. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH]. I am


1321
1:34:13,48 --> 1:34:20,6
bilingual, proud of it. My question to the
candidates, we have 4 million Puerto Ricans


1322
1:34:20,6 --> 1:34:28,4
in the United States, voters, 3.8 in Puerto
Rico. We have been treated as second class


1323
1:34:28,4 --> 1:34:34,79
citizen and just now our governor's name was
not mentioned as a V.P. possibility, a great


1324
1:34:34,79 --> 1:34:39,99
governor. My question to you is, where do
you stand for Puerto Rico to become a state?


1325
1:34:39,99 --> 1:34:46,7
And secondly, how do you -- where do you stand
on domestic trade between Florida and Puerto


1326
1:34:46,7 --> 1:34:51,3
Rico, between Tampa Bay and Ponce ports which
have been neglected? Thank you. BLITZER: All


1327
1:34:51,3 --> 1:34:54,67
right. Senator Santorum, let's throw that
question to you. The question about, do you


1328
1:34:54,67 --> 1:34:56,98
support Puerto Rico potentially as the 51st
state?


1329
1:34:56,98 --> 1:35:1,28
>> SANTORUM: Well, first, I will give a shout-out
to Governor Luis Fortuno, who is a good friend


1330
1:35:1,28 --> 1:35:5,38
of mine, and someone -- I know him and his
family, we have known each other for many


1331
1:35:5,38 --> 1:35:11,14
years, we actually used to go to church together.
And so I spoke to Luis this week. And I've


1332
1:35:11,14 --> 1:35:15,79
been to Puerto Rico many times. And actually,
when I was a United States senator, we did


1333
1:35:15,79 --> 1:35:21,99
a lot of work with Puerto Rico. Because of
my relationship with many friends down there,


1334
1:35:21,99 --> 1:35:25,89
I was made aware of problems, for example,
in the Medicaid program. We went down and


1335
1:35:25,89 --> 1:35:34,93
we actually passed things to help with reimbursement
rates, which were deplorably low in Puerto


1336
1:35:34,93 --> 1:35:40,61
Rico. We also worked on hurricane relief and
a whole lost of other things as a result of


1337
1:35:40,61 --> 1:35:46,78
my relationship with many Puerto Ricans in
Pennsylvania, and developed those relationships


1338
1:35:46,78 --> 1:35:52,5
on the island. I believe that -- I believe
in self-determination. That, you know, the


1339
1:35:52,5 --> 1:35:56,17
Puerto Rican people should have the opportunity
to be able to be able to speak on this. I


1340
1:35:56,17 --> 1:36:0,67
have supported that. I don't take a position
one way or the other on statehood, commonwealth,


1341
1:36:0,67 --> 1:36:5,33
independence, that's for the people of Puerto
Rico to decide. But I also supported a lot


1342
1:36:5,33 --> 1:36:10,42
of things to help the Puerto Rican economy.
Puerto Ricans are United States citizens,


1343
1:36:10,42 --> 1:36:17,71
and the poverty, the unemployment rates simply
are -- are simply not something that we as


1344
1:36:17,71 --> 1:36:24,27
Americans should allow to occur in our country.
And we need to make sure that there are pro-growth,


1345
1:36:24,27 --> 1:36:31,15
supply side economics to make sure that Puerto
Rico can be successful as an economy on that


1346
1:36:31,15 --> 1:36:34,51
island, and I believe they can. And under
my administration, that's something that I


1347
1:36:34,51 --> 1:36:35,17
would work towards.


1348
1:36:35,17 --> 1:36:39,96
>> BLITZER: I'll take that as a maybe. Statehood,
not statehood.


1349
1:36:39,96 --> 1:36:44,51
>> SANTORUM: No, I take no position on that.
That's -- I would -- I've supported, you know,


1350
1:36:44,51 --> 1:36:46,219
the opportunity for them to make that decision.


1351
1:36:46,219 --> 1:36:49,66
>> BLITZER: Let's take another question from
the audience here. Go ahead, please. What


1352
1:36:49,66 --> 1:36:50,46
is your name?


1353
1:36:50,46 --> 1:36:54,99
>> SUZANNE BASS: Suzanne Bass, I'm an attorney
in Jacksonville. Welcome to the great city


1354
1:36:54,99 --> 1:37:3,28
of Jacksonville. My question, how would your
religious beliefs, if you're elected, impact


1355
1:37:3,28 --> 1:37:7,8
the decisions that you make in the office
of the presidency?


1356
1:37:7,8 --> 1:37:9,5
>> BLITZER: Congressman Paul?


1357
1:37:9,5 --> 1:37:13,16
>> PAUL: Well, my religious beliefs wouldn't
affect it. My religious beliefs affect my


1358
1:37:13,16 --> 1:37:17,63
character in the way I treat people and the
way I live. The only thing it would affect...


1359
1:37:17,63 --> 1:37:18,98
>> [APPLAUSE]


1360
1:37:18,98 --> 1:37:27,91
>> PAUL: The only thing that would affect
me in the way I operate as a president or


1361
1:37:27,91 --> 1:37:32,88
a congressman is my oath of office and my
promises that I've made to the people.


1362
1:37:32,88 --> 1:37:35,82
>> BLITZER: Governor?


1363
1:37:35,82 --> 1:37:41,27
>> ROMNEY: Ron Paul makes very good point.
I concur with that. I would also seek the


1364
1:37:41,27 --> 1:37:47,22
guidance of -- of providence in making critical
decisions. And of course, ours is a nation


1365
1:37:47,22 --> 1:37:52,21
which is based upon Judeo- Christian values
and ethics. Our law is based upon those values


1366
1:37:52,21 --> 1:37:57,79
and ethics. And in some cases, our law doesn't
encompass -- encompass all of the issues that


1367
1:37:57,79 --> 1:38:2,53
we face around the world. The conviction that
the founders, when they wrote the Declaration


1368
1:38:2,53 --> 1:38:7,3
of Independence, were writing a document that
was not just temporary and not just for one


1369
1:38:7,3 --> 1:38:12,86
small locale but really something which described
the relationship between God and man -- that's


1370
1:38:12,86 --> 1:38:16,56
something which I think a president would
carry in his heart. So when they said, for


1371
1:38:16,56 --> 1:38:20,99
instance, that the creator had "endowed us
with certain unalienable rights, among them


1372
1:38:20,99 --> 1:38:26,6
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,"
I would seek to assure that those principles


1373
1:38:26,6 --> 1:38:31,33
and values remain in America and that we help
share them with other people in the world,


1374
1:38:31,33 --> 1:38:36,66
not by conquering them, but by helping them
through our trade, through our various forms


1375
1:38:36,66 --> 1:38:41,9
of soft power, to help bring people the joy
and -- and -- and opportunity that exists


1376
1:38:41,9 --> 1:38:45,57
in this great land.


1377
1:38:45,57 --> 1:38:49,2
>> BLITZER: Mr. Speaker?


1378
1:38:49,2 --> 1:38:50,17
>> [APPLAUSE]


1379
1:38:50,17 --> 1:38:56,27
>> GINGRICH: I would say that there are three
ways in which religion would affect me. The


1380
1:38:56,27 --> 1:39:2,52
first is, I agree with Governor Romney. I
think anyone who is president is faced with


1381
1:39:2,52 --> 1:39:9,3
decisions so enormous that they should go
to God. They should seek guidance. Because


1382
1:39:9,3 --> 1:39:13,45
these are decisions beyond the ability of
mere mortals to truly decide without some


1383
1:39:13,45 --> 1:39:20,32
sense of what it is we should be doing. I
would say, second, that we have a real obligation


1384
1:39:20,32 --> 1:39:25,49
to recognize that, if you're truly faithful,
it's not just an hour on Sundays or Saturdays


1385
1:39:25,49 --> 1:39:29,9
or Fridays. It's in fact something that should
suffuse your life, to be a part of who you


1386
1:39:29,9 --> 1:39:34,55
are. And in that sense, it is inextricably
tied in with how you behave. But I would say,


1387
1:39:34,55 --> 1:39:38,81
third, one of the reasons I am running is
there has been an increasingly aggressive


1388
1:39:38,81 --> 1:39:45,989
war against religion and in particular against
Christianity in this country, largely by...


1389
1:39:45,989 --> 1:39:48,29
>> [APPLAUSE]


1390
1:39:48,29 --> 1:39:54,81
>> GINRICH: largely by a secular elite and
the academic news media and judicial areas.


1391
1:39:54,81 --> 1:39:59,65
And I frankly believe it's important to have
some leadership that stands up and says, enough;


1392
1:39:59,65 --> 1:40:4,88
we are truly guaranteed the right of religious
freedom, not religious suppression by the


1393
1:40:4,88 --> 1:40:6,179
state.


1394
1:40:6,179 --> 1:40:7,49
>> [APPLAUSE]


1395
1:40:7,49 --> 1:40:10,1
>> BLITZER: Senator?


1396
1:40:10,1 --> 1:40:13,8
>> SANTORUM: Faith is a very, very important
part of my life, but it's a very, very important


1397
1:40:13,8 --> 1:40:18,44
part of this country. The foundational documents
of our country -- everybody talks about the


1398
1:40:18,44 --> 1:40:21,83
Constitution, very, very important. But the
Constitution is the "how" of America. It's


1399
1:40:21,83 --> 1:40:27,53
the operator's manual. The "why" of America,
who we are as a people, is in the Declaration


1400
1:40:27,53 --> 1:40:30,82
of Independence, "We hold these truths to
be self-evident that all men are created equal


1401
1:40:30,82 --> 1:40:37,61
and endowed by their creator with certain
unalienable rights." The Constitution is there


1402
1:40:37,61 --> 1:40:43,42
to do one thing: protect God-given rights.
That's what makes America different than every


1403
1:40:43,42 --> 1:40:48,44
other country in the world. No other country
in the world has its rights -- rights based


1404
1:40:48,44 --> 1:40:54,51
in God-given rights, not government-given
rights. And so when you say, well, faith has


1405
1:40:54,51 --> 1:41:0,2
nothing to do with it, faith has everything
to do with it. If rights come...


1406
1:41:0,2 --> 1:41:2,22
>> [APPLAUSE]


1407
1:41:2,22 --> 1:41:11,83
>> SANTORUM: If our president believes that
rights come to us from the state, everything


1408
1:41:11,83 --> 1:41:17,28
government gives you, it can take away. The
role of the government is to protect rights


1409
1:41:17,28 --> 1:41:22,82
that cannot be taken away. And so the answer
to that question is, I believe in faith and


1410
1:41:22,82 --> 1:41:27,88
reason and approaching the problems of this
country but understand where those rights


1411
1:41:27,88 --> 1:41:33,32
come from, who we are as Americans and the
foundational principles by which we have changed


1412
1:41:33,32 --> 1:41:34,0
the world.


1413
1:41:34,0 --> 1:41:35,119
>> BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.


1414
1:41:35,119 --> 1:41:35,39
>> [APPLAUSE]


1415
1:41:35,39 --> 1:41:39,81
>> BLITZER: We have one more break to take,
but we have a lot more to discuss. Don't go


1416
1:41:39,81 --> 1:41:46,48
too far away. Coming up, the final debate
question before Florida votes.


1417
1:41:46,48 --> 1:41:48,58
>> [APPLAUSE]


1418
1:41:48,58 --> 1:41:52,78
>> [COMMERCIAL BREAK]


1419
1:41:52,78 --> 1:42:5,51
>> BLITZER: All right. We're in the last few
minutes of the last question to these four


1420
1:42:5,51 --> 1:42:11,38
presidential candidates before the Florida
primary on Tuesday in this debate format.


1421
1:42:11,38 --> 1:42:16,0
Here is the question, and it involves the
president of the United States. I want you


1422
1:42:16,0 --> 1:42:21,87
to tell voters who are watching or are here
on this campus right now why you are the one


1423
1:42:21,87 --> 1:42:28,15
person on this stage that is most likely to
beat Barack Obama. Congressman?


1424
1:42:28,15 --> 1:42:33,22
>> PAUL: Well, you know, so far, we have some
pretty good evidence that I'll do quite well


1425
1:42:33,22 --> 1:42:37,39
and have a better chance than the rest to
beat him, because if you do a national poll,


1426
1:42:37,39 --> 1:42:44,23
I do very, very well against Obama. But one
of the reasons is, is that the freedom message


1427
1:42:44,23 --> 1:42:52,6
in the Constitution is very appealing to everybody
in all political beliefs because it includes


1428
1:42:52,6 --> 1:42:57,63
free markets, which conservatives endorse,
but it also protects civil liberties, the


1429
1:42:57,63 --> 1:43:3,9
way people run their lives. If it is a God-given
life, and it's your life, you should have


1430
1:43:3,9 --> 1:43:7,34
the right to run your life as you so choose
as long as you don't harm other people. This


1431
1:43:7,34 --> 1:43:11,71
means a lot more tolerance that some would
like to give. So that brings people in who


1432
1:43:11,71 --> 1:43:17,9
are concerned about civil liberties, and all
of a sudden, my position undermines Obama


1433
1:43:17,9 --> 1:43:22,45
completely and totally because the foreign
policy is different. He promises to end the


1434
1:43:22,45 --> 1:43:27,72
wars, but the wars expand. A constitutional
foreign policy will end the wars. And if you


1435
1:43:27,72 --> 1:43:32,79
want somebody to talk about peace and prosperity,
it has to be somebody who understands money


1436
1:43:32,79 --> 1:43:35,13
and a foreign policy and free markets.


1437
1:43:35,13 --> 1:43:35,489
>> [APPLAUSE]


1438
1:43:35,489 --> 1:43:41,54
>> BLITZER: Governor Romney, why are you the
one person on this stage most likely to beat


1439
1:43:41,54 --> 1:43:42,53
President Obama?


1440
1:43:42,53 --> 1:43:46,8
>> ROMNEY: The people of America recognize
that this is a critical time. This is not


1441
1:43:46,8 --> 1:43:50,75
just an average election. This is a time where
we're going to decide whether America will


1442
1:43:50,75 --> 1:43:54,68
remain the great hope of the 21st century,
whether this will be an American century,


1443
1:43:54,68 --> 1:43:58,74
or, instead, whether we'll continue to go
down a path to become more and more like Europe,


1444
1:43:58,74 --> 1:44:3,67
a social welfare state. That's where we're
headed. Our economy is becoming weaker. The


1445
1:44:3,67 --> 1:44:7,61
foundation of our future economy is being
eroded. Government has become too large. We're


1446
1:44:7,61 --> 1:44:11,49
headed in a very dangerous direction. I believe
to get America back on track, we're going


1447
1:44:11,49 --> 1:44:16,9
to have to have dramatic, fundamental, extraordinary
change in Washington to be able to allow our


1448
1:44:16,9 --> 1:44:22,14
private sector to once again reemerge competitively,
to scale back the size of government and to


1449
1:44:22,14 --> 1:44:27,86
maintain our strength abroad in our military
capacities. I believe that, to change Washington


1450
1:44:27,86 --> 1:44:32,82
in such a dramatic way, you cannot do it by
people who have been there their entire careers.


1451
1:44:32,82 --> 1:44:37,83
I believe, if you just elect the same people
to change chairs in Washington, not much happen.


1452
1:44:37,83 --> 1:44:40,97
I think, if you want to change Washington,
you're going to have to bring someone in who


1453
1:44:40,97 --> 1:44:45,37
has been on the outside. I have lived in the
private sector. I know how it works. I've


1454
1:44:45,37 --> 1:44:49,53
competed with businesses around the world.
I know how to win. I know what it takes to


1455
1:44:49,53 --> 1:44:53,76
keep America strong. I know how to work in
government. I've had experience for -- four


1456
1:44:53,76 --> 1:44:57,5
years, rather, working as the governor of
Massachusetts. I will use the experience of


1457
1:44:57,5 --> 1:45:1,92
my life to get America right. And I will be
able to convince the American people that


1458
1:45:1,92 --> 1:45:6,43
someone with my experience is very different
than Barack Obama. And that experience is


1459
1:45:6,43 --> 1:45:7,949
how I'll beat him.


1460
1:45:7,949 --> 1:45:8,53
>> [APPLAUSE]


1461
1:45:8,53 --> 1:45:10,25
>> BLITZER: Mr. Speaker...


1462
1:45:10,25 --> 1:45:10,82
>> [APPLAUSE]


1463
1:45:10,82 --> 1:45:18,42
>> BLITZER: why are you the one person on
this stage most likely to beat President Obama?


1464
1:45:18,42 --> 1:45:24,97
>> GINGRICH: You know, I have participated
in the two largest Republican sweeps in modern


1465
1:45:24,97 --> 1:45:31,2
time, 1980, in the Reagan campaign, and 1994,
with the Contract with America, which had


1466
1:45:31,2 --> 1:45:36,43
the largest one-party increase in American
history, 9 million extra votes. I believe


1467
1:45:36,43 --> 1:45:42,62
that what we need this fall is a big-choice
election that goes to the heart of who we


1468
1:45:42,62 --> 1:45:47,99
are. I'm running more than anything for my
two grandchildren, Maggie and Robert. I'd


1469
1:45:47,99 --> 1:45:53,44
like them to be able to look back 50 years
from now and say that what we did, what we


1470
1:45:53,44 --> 1:45:59,4
the American people did, the choice we made
in 2012 to unleash the American people, to


1471
1:45:59,4 --> 1:46:5,78
rebuild our country based on the core values,
to pose for the American people a simple choice:


1472
1:46:5,78 --> 1:46:10,74
Do you want freedom and independence and a
paycheck and a job, or do you want dependence


1473
1:46:10,74 --> 1:46:16,7
and big government and food stamps and a lack
of future? And I believe, if we have a big


1474
1:46:16,7 --> 1:46:22,72
election with truly historic big choices,
that we can defeat Barack Obama by a huge


1475
1:46:22,72 --> 1:46:28,5
margin. But it won't be by running just as
a Republican. It will be an American campaign


1476
1:46:28,5 --> 1:46:34,13
open to every American who prefers a paycheck
to food stamps, who prefers the Declaration


1477
1:46:34,13 --> 1:46:39,11
of Independence to Saul Alinsky and who prefers
a strong national security to trying to appease


1478
1:46:39,11 --> 1:46:39,96
our enemies.


1479
1:46:39,96 --> 1:46:40,44
>> [APPLAUSE]


1480
1:46:40,44 --> 1:46:41,4
>> BLITZER: Senator?


1481
1:46:41,4 --> 1:46:41,88
>> [APPLAUSE]


1482
1:46:41,88 --> 1:46:49,38
>> BLITZER: I'll repeat the question for you.
Why do you think you're the best, most qualified


1483
1:46:49,38 --> 1:46:52,239
person on this stage to beat President Obama?


1484
1:46:52,239 --> 1:46:55,34
>> SANTORUM: I agree with the previous two
speakers that this is a big election. This


1485
1:46:55,34 --> 1:46:58,9
is an election about fundamental freedom.
It's about who America is going to be. Are


1486
1:46:58,9 --> 1:47:3,1
we a country that's going to be built great
from the bottom up, as our founders intended,


1487
1:47:3,1 --> 1:47:7,32
or from the top down? I just think I'm a lot
better than the previous two speakers to be


1488
1:47:7,32 --> 1:47:11,47
able to make that case to the American people.
I'm not for a top- down government-run health


1489
1:47:11,47 --> 1:47:16,61
care system. I wasn't for the Wall Street
bailouts like these two gentlemen were. Governor


1490
1:47:16,61 --> 1:47:19,7
Romney talks about the private sector and
how he's going to bring private sector. When


1491
1:47:19,7 --> 1:47:23,65
the private sector was in trouble, he voted
for government to come in and take over the


1492
1:47:23,65 --> 1:47:29,93
private sector and be able to -- and to bail
them out. Cap-and-trade -- both of them bought


1493
1:47:29,93 --> 1:47:33,65
into the global warming hoax, bought into
the cap-and-trade, top-down control of our


1494
1:47:33,65 --> 1:47:38,8
energy and manufacturing sector. If you look
at President Obama's speech the other night,


1495
1:47:38,8 --> 1:47:43,88
what did he lead with? He lead with manufacturing.
He led with manufacturing why? Because the


1496
1:47:43,88 --> 1:47:49,74
base of his party, the ones that are always
the ones -- not the base -- the swing vote


1497
1:47:49,74 --> 1:47:54,26
in his party, the ones that Ronald Reagan
was able to get -- we call them Reagan Democrats


1498
1:47:54,26 --> 1:47:58,98
up in Pennsylvania. Those are the blue-collar
working people of America who know that this


1499
1:47:58,98 --> 1:48:4,64
president has left them behind. He has a plan
for them, and it's more dependency, not work,


1500
1:48:4,64 --> 1:48:8,26
not opportunity. So he went out and tried
to make a play for manufacturing. That's been


1501
1:48:8,26 --> 1:48:11,89
the center point of my campaign. The center
point of my campaign is to be able to win


1502
1:48:11,89 --> 1:48:16,21
the industrial heartland, get those Reagan
Democrats back, talking about manufacturing,


1503
1:48:16,21 --> 1:48:20,28
talking about building that ladder of success
all the way down so people can climb all the


1504
1:48:20,28 --> 1:48:25,7
way up. That's why I'm the best person to
be able to go out and win the states that


1505
1:48:25,7 --> 1:48:30,15
are necessary to win this presidency and govern
with the mandate that Newt just talked about.


1506
1:48:30,15 --> 1:48:30,87
>> BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.


1507
1:48:30,87 --> 1:48:31,5
>> [APPLAUSE]


1508
1:48:31,5 --> 1:48:35,4
>> BLITZER: And thank you to the four presidential
candidates.


1509
1:48:35,4 --> 1:48:35,72
>> [APPLAUSE]


1510
1:48:35,72 --> 1:48:40,52
>> BLITZER: I also want to thank our partners
in this debate, the Republican Party of Florida,


1511
1:48:40,52 --> 1:48:45,52
the Hispanic Leadership Network. Thank you
very much to them.


1512
1:48:45,52 --> 1:48:46,57
>> [APPLAUSE]


1513
1:48:46,57 --> 1:48:58,43
>> BLITZER: We'd also like to thank our hosts
here on the campus of the University of North


1514
1:48:58,43 --> 1:50:58,43
Florida in Jacksonville.
