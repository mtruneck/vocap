CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to CNN STUDENT
NEWS on this Tuesday, December 18th and thank


2
0:0:16,379 --> 0:0:20,71
you for joining us. I`m Carl Azuz. Today`s
show begins in Connecticut.


3
0:0:20,71 --> 0:0:26,63
The community of Newtown, Connecticut is in
mourning after a massacre at an elementary


4
0:0:26,63 --> 0:0:31,84
school. Our complete coverage of the story
is in Monday`s show at cnnstudentnews.com.


5
0:0:31,84 --> 0:0:36,87
As police expand their investigation into
what led to the tragedy, people in Newtown


6
0:0:36,87 --> 0:0:41,5
are banding together and they are getting
support from across the country. They are


7
0:0:41,5 --> 0:0:45,89
holding memorials and vigils for the victims.
Mourners are saying prayers for the victims,


8
0:0:45,89 --> 0:0:49,98
their families and their community. The U.S.
Postal Service has set up a place where people


9
0:0:49,98 --> 0:0:54,909
can mail their condolences and messages of
support to Newtown. If you are interested


10
0:0:54,909 --> 0:1:2,979
in that, the address is "Message of Condolence",
it`s P.O. Box 3700, Newtown, Connecticut,


11
0:1:2,979 --> 0:1:4,449
06470.


12
0:1:4,449 --> 0:1:8,24
When President Obama spoke at a high school
there on Sunday night, he questioned whether


13
0:1:8,24 --> 0:1:11,98
Americans were doing enough to bring this
kind of violence to an end.


14
0:1:11,98 --> 0:1:12,39
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


15
0:1:12,39 --> 0:1:16,44
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: Can we truly say as a nation that


16
0:1:16,44 --> 0:1:29,74
we are meeting our obligations? Can we honestly
say that we are doing enough to keep our children,


17
0:1:29,74 --> 0:1:41,12
all of them safe from harm? Can we claim as
a nation that we are altogether there, letting


18
0:1:41,12 --> 0:1:47,28
them know that they are loved and teaching
them to love in return? Can we say that we


19
0:1:47,28 --> 0:1:55,2
are truly doing enough to give all the children
of this country the chance they deserve to


20
0:1:55,2 --> 0:2:4,6
live out their lives in happiness and with
purpose? I`ve been reflecting on this the


21
0:2:4,6 --> 0:2:11,78
last few days. And if we are honest with ourselves,
the answer is no. We are not doing enough.


22
0:2:11,78 --> 0:2:14,42
And we all have to change.


23
0:2:14,42 --> 0:2:15,74
(END VIDEO CLIP)


24
0:2:15,74 --> 0:2:20,52
AZUZ: All right, but how? There are a lot
of people out there in the media, from leaders


25
0:2:20,52 --> 0:2:25,819
and journalists to musicians and actors sharing
their theories on what led to this and how


26
0:2:25,819 --> 0:2:30,39
to prevent it. We`d like to hear from you,
what are your ideas on how the nation can


27
0:2:30,39 --> 0:2:35,4
change to keep kids safer? Please, share your
thoughts and only your first names on our


28
0:2:35,4 --> 0:2:38,6
blog at cnnstudentnews.com


29
0:2:38,6 --> 0:2:41,48
Some of the people who live in Newtown are
sharing their thoughts on this, they are trying


30
0:2:41,48 --> 0:2:45,76
to turn some of the attention that`s focused
on them to the issues that they believe should


31
0:2:45,76 --> 0:2:50,34
be addressed to prevent this from happening
somewhere else. CNN`s Kyung Lah reports on


32
0:2:50,34 --> 0:2:52,28
what some citizens of Newtown are saying.


33
0:2:52,28 --> 0:2:52,84
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


34
0:2:52,84 --> 0:2:55,209
KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You can hear
their frustration.


35
0:2:55,209 --> 0:2:59,9
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At the point you buy body
armor, shouldn`t the FBI be at your door?


36
0:2:59,9 --> 0:3:4,349
LAH: These are questions asked before after
Columbine and Virginia Tech and again, this


37
0:3:4,349 --> 0:3:10,44
year, in places like Aurora, Colorado and
Clackamas, Oregon. This time, it`s this Newtown


38
0:3:10,44 --> 0:3:13,62
residents who knew the children and teachers
killed at Sandy Hook.


39
0:3:13,62 --> 0:3:17,12
CRAIG MITTLEMAN, NEWTOWN RESIDENT: We have
the benefit and the misfortunate of being


40
0:3:17,12 --> 0:3:22,99
on the national stage right now. This is a
real opportunity for us to make a statement.


41
0:3:22,99 --> 0:3:27,99
LAH: They have no political power in this
room, just grief. Grief channeled into a will


42
0:3:27,99 --> 0:3:27,84
to bring change.


43
0:3:27,84 --> 0:3:31,29
LEE SHULL, NEWTOWN RESIDENT: I think we need
to talk about what`s reasonable. I don`t think


44
0:3:31,29 --> 0:3:35,31
it`s reasonable for assault weapons in any
way in our society except for the military


45
0:3:35,31 --> 0:3:35,68
or police.


46
0:3:35,68 --> 0:3:39,319
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mental illness, shove
it underneath the rug. We can`t do that anymore.


47
0:3:39,319 --> 0:3:45,95
MARY SIRECI, NEWTOWN RESIDENT: We do something
now and leave here with some proactive things,


48
0:3:45,95 --> 0:3:46,62
some action.


49
0:3:46,62 --> 0:3:51,9
LAH: What you are looking at is the birth
of a grassroots effort from a town in pain.


50
0:3:51,9 --> 0:3:56,16
They have built a Facebook page calling themselves
Newtown United. They admit they don`t know


51
0:3:56,16 --> 0:3:59,26
what they are doing, just that they have to
do something.


52
0:3:59,26 --> 0:4:3,59
BILL TOOMEY, NEWTOWN RESIDENT: If this is
a trigger point, or a tipping point for us


53
0:4:3,59 --> 0:4:8,349
and our elected officials to actually start
talking to each other in a way that`s respectful


54
0:4:8,349 --> 0:4:11,12
and results in real change that would be huge.


55
0:4:11,12 --> 0:4:15,97
LAH: The goal of Newtown United to prevent
another town from suffering what this one


56
0:4:15,97 --> 0:4:22,43
is enduring will not go unheated. Kyung Lah,
CNN, Newtown, Connecticut.


57
0:4:22,43 --> 0:4:23,98
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


58
0:4:23,98 --> 0:4:31,91
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me.
I used to be part of the Ottoman Empire, you`ll


59
0:4:31,91 --> 0:4:38,449
find me between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean
Sea, my largest city is Istanbul, but my capital


60
0:4:38,449 --> 0:4:40,669
is Ankara.


61
0:4:40,669 --> 0:4:47,37
I`m Turkey, and I bridge countries in Europe
and the Middle East.


62
0:4:47,37 --> 0:4:49,889
(END VIDE CLIP)


63
0:4:49,889 --> 0:4:54,98
AZUZ: That bridge between East and West makes
Turkey an important country in international


64
0:4:54,98 --> 0:4:59,2
issues. You see in this map how one of its
border countries is Syria, well, some of the


65
0:4:59,2 --> 0:5:4,85
weapons fired in Syria` civil war have hit
locations in Turkey. Turkey is a member of


66
0:5:4,85 --> 0:5:10,32
NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
That makes it an ally of 27 other countries


67
0:5:10,32 --> 0:5:14,88
including the U.S. And Germany. So, those
two nations are sending Patriot missiles to


68
0:5:14,88 --> 0:5:20,6
Turkey to help protect it from the violence
in Syria. This is a file photo of a Patriot


69
0:5:20,6 --> 0:5:25,479
missile launcher, one thing these missiles
can do is intercept and destroy other missiles,


70
0:5:25,479 --> 0:5:30,8
and that`s the idea here. If weapons used
in Syria` civil war come close to Turkey,


71
0:5:30,8 --> 0:5:34,71
the Patriots could intercept them and help
keep Turkish citizens safe.


72
0:5:34,71 --> 0:5:35,729
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


73
0:5:35,729 --> 0:5:41,2
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s time for the "Shoutout."
What is the biggest source of U.S. Government


74
0:5:41,2 --> 0:5:48,169
revenue? If you think you know it then shout
it out. Is it taxes, interest on loans, land


75
0:5:48,169 --> 0:5:56,27
leasing or borrowing? You`ve got three seconds,
go!


76
0:5:56,27 --> 0:6:3,24
Taxes on citizens and businesses account for
most of the government`s revenue. That`s your


77
0:6:3,24 --> 0:6:5,47
answer and that`s your "Shoutout."


78
0:6:5,47 --> 0:6:7,18
(END VIDEO CLIP)


79
0:6:7,18 --> 0:6:12,86
AZUZ: That`s why the debate over taxes, who
gets taxed and by how much is so important


80
0:6:12,86 --> 0:6:18,11
to the U.S. Government`s debate over the upcoming
fiscal cliff. It`s a series of tax increases


81
0:6:18,11 --> 0:6:22,84
in government`s spending cuts that will automatically
happen in January. A lot of experts agree


82
0:6:22,84 --> 0:6:28,25
it would be a bad thing for the U.S. Economy,
and it can only be avoided if Congress and


83
0:6:28,25 --> 0:6:33,25
the president can agree on another way to
address the nation`s massive debt. One way


84
0:6:33,25 --> 0:6:38,86
to do that is by reducing government spending,
but that`s is easier said than done. Tom Foreman


85
0:6:38,86 --> 0:6:40,88
has an excellent illustration of "why".


86
0:6:40,88 --> 0:6:41,169
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


87
0:6:41,169 --> 0:6:44,7
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What you are
looking at in this room, is everything the


88
0:6:44,7 --> 0:6:49,68
federal government spends money on, and that
score board back there shows you the problem.


89
0:6:49,68 --> 0:6:56,139
Last year we spent $3.6 trillion on all this
stuff, but we only took in $2.3 trillion in


90
0:6:56,139 --> 0:7:1,72
taxes or revenue. Now, Democrats tend to like
to talk more in these talks about the revenue


91
0:7:1,72 --> 0:7:5,75
side of the equation. They say if we can find
the way to gin up more taxes, lean on the


92
0:7:5,75 --> 0:7:10,37
rich harder, that`s how we can deal with this
deficit. But Republicans while agreeing we


93
0:7:10,37 --> 0:7:14,34
may need more revenue want to talk a lot more
about all this stuff, and whether or not they


94
0:7:14,34 --> 0:7:16,539
can cut some things down.


95
0:7:16,539 --> 0:7:20,449
One of the first things you may notice is
that not all spending is equal. You could


96
0:7:20,449 --> 0:7:25,19
have dramatic cuts in things like Homeland
Security, the Energy Department and the Interior


97
0:7:25,19 --> 0:7:29,88
Department. If you cut those programs out
entirely, yeah, you`d save $80 billion, but


98
0:7:29,88 --> 0:7:35,63
that`s only a small fraction of the deficit.
That`s why the talk is largely about this


99
0:7:35,63 --> 0:7:40,979
back row, where the big ticket items reside,
such as Social Security, health and human


100
0:7:40,979 --> 0:7:46,33
services, home to Medicare and Medicaid and
defense. Each one of these accounts for more


101
0:7:46,33 --> 0:7:52,8
than $700 billion in spending, so yeah, if
you could find a way to somehow chop about


102
0:7:52,8 --> 0:7:57,94
25 percent out of each program here, you`d
get real savings, about half trillion dollars.


103
0:7:57,94 --> 0:8:2,759
But doing that would be unbelievably tough,
the simple truth is some of them are protected


104
0:8:2,759 --> 0:8:6,58
from cuts. Social Security is something that
Democrats and Republicans alike have been


105
0:8:6,58 --> 0:8:11,61
very afraid to go after. The social programs
are very much protected by Democrats and the


106
0:8:11,61 --> 0:8:17,19
Republicans are equally protective of Defense.
That`s why these talks are so tough. The simple


107
0:8:17,19 --> 0:8:24,34
truth is, every program in this room has constituents
who will fight tooth and nail to hold on to


108
0:8:24,34 --> 0:8:25,43
the funding.


109
0:8:25,43 --> 0:8:32,269
What there is this, if no deal is struck and
the fiscal cliff comes, than $600 billion


110
0:8:32,269 --> 0:8:37,919
in automatic tax increases and spending cuts
will kick in, that could effect a lot of programs


111
0:8:37,919 --> 0:8:43,899
in this room and that will absolutely leave
an awful lot of voters, Democratic and Republican


112
0:8:43,899 --> 0:8:44,66
unhappy.


113
0:8:44,66 --> 0:8:46,18
(END VIDEOTAPE)


114
0:8:46,18 --> 0:8:48,99
AZUZ: Before we go today, it`s a Christmas
mystery:


115
0:8:48,99 --> 0:8:50,5
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


116
0:8:50,5 --> 0:8:53,68
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We found it at 5 a.m,
in the morning, and it glows, it lights up.


117
0:8:53,68 --> 0:8:54,399
(END VIDEOTAPE)


118
0:8:54,399 --> 0:9:1,86
AZUZ: Yeah, it does. And it mysteriously showed
up in someone`s front yard in a Missouri community.


119
0:9:1,86 --> 0:9:6,54
This 30-foot Santa came with instructions.
Enjoy it or at least leave it up there for


120
0:9:6,54 --> 0:9:12,62
24 hours, then schlep the statuesque Santa
in a slay or maybe more realistically a pickup


121
0:9:12,62 --> 0:9:18,48
truck over to the house of someone else with
children. Kids love it. Well, why shouldn`t


122
0:9:18,48 --> 0:9:23,97
they? It`s santastic! And not keeping the
mystery alive would be positively deflating.


123
0:9:23,97 --> 0:9:27,49
We hope you enjoy the rest of your day and
you`ll join us again tomorrow on CNN STUDENT


124
0:9:27,49 --> 0:11:27,49
