1
0:0:7,959 --> 0:0:12,4
In Season One of the Story of Stuff,
we looked at a system that creates way  


2
0:0:12,4 --> 0:0:14,669
too much stuff, and way too little of 
what we really want.


3
0:0:14,669 --> 0:0:18,8
Now we're going to start looking at the 
stories behind the story of stuff.


4
0:0:18,8 --> 0:0:21,749
That's where we'll find ways to turn 
this situation around.


5
0:0:21,749 --> 0:0:31,619
Welcome to Season Two.


6
0:0:31,619 --> 0:0:35,59
Ever since I learned where our stuff 
really comes from - and how this system 


7
0:0:35,59 --> 0:0:38,43
is trashing people and the planet - I've 
been trying to figure out how we can 


8
0:0:38,43 --> 0:0:40,92
change it. I've read a lot of these: 100 


9
0:0:40,92 --> 0:0:44,23
Ways to Save the Planet Without Leaving 
Your House, 


10
0:0:44,23 --> 0:0:46,81
50 Simple Things You Can do 
to Save the Earth, 


11
0:0:46,81 --> 0:0:51,87
The Little Green Book of Shopping. 
I thought they might have the


12
0:0:51,87 --> 0:0:52,619
answers, but their tips all start here 


13
0:0:52,619 --> 0:0:54,12
with buying better stuff 


14
0:0:54,12 --> 0:0:58,53
and they all end here - with recycling
all that stuff when I'm done with it. 


15
0:0:58,53 --> 0:1:2,83
But when it comes to making change, this 
story of "going green" - even though we 


16
0:1:2,83 --> 0:1:3,769
see it everywhere - 


17
0:1:3,769 --> 0:1:6,15
has some serious shortcomings. 


18
0:1:6,15 --> 0:1:8,51
It says that if I become a smarter
shopper, 


19
0:1:8,51 --> 0:1:10,619
and tell my friends to do the same, 


20
0:1:10,619 --> 0:1:12,6
I've done my part. 


21
0:1:12,6 --> 0:1:14,16
And if I don't buy all this green stuff, 


22
0:1:14,16 --> 0:1:17,5
then it's my fault that the planet's 
being destroyed. 


23
0:1:17,5 --> 0:1:18,94
Wait a minute. My fault? 


24
0:1:18,94 --> 0:1:22,65
I didn't choose to put toxic products on
the shelves or to allow slave labor in 


25
0:1:22,65 --> 0:1:24,229
factories around the world. 


26
0:1:24,229 --> 0:1:28,2
I didn't choose to fill stores with 
electronics that can't be repaired


27
0:1:28,2 --> 0:1:32,18
and have to be thrown away. I didn't 
choose a world in which some people can


28
0:1:32,18 --> 0:1:37,17
afford to live green, leaving the rest 
of us to be irresponsible planet 


29
0:1:37,17 --> 0:1:41,39
wreckers! Of course when we do shop we 
should buy the least toxic and most fair 


30
0:1:41,39 --> 0:1:42,42
products we can, 


31
0:1:42,42 --> 0:1:46,48
but it's not bad shoppers here 
who are the source of the problem, it's


32
0:1:46,48 --> 0:1:48,48
bad policies and bad business practices 
here. 


33
0:1:48,48 --> 0:1:53,7
And that's why the solutions we really 
need aren't for sale at the supermarket. 


34
0:1:53,7 --> 0:1:55,33
If we actually want to change the world, 


35
0:1:55,33 --> 0:1:58,57
we can't talk only about consumers 
voting with our dollars. 


36
0:1:58,57 --> 0:2:3,29
Real change happens when citizens come 
together to demand rules that work. 


37
0:2:3,29 --> 0:2:5,69
Look, it is important to try to live 
green. 


38
0:2:5,69 --> 0:2:8,359
As Gandhi said, “be the change.” 


39
0:2:8,359 --> 0:2:12,409
Living our values in small ways shows 
ourselves and others we care. 


40
0:2:12,409 --> 0:2:15,4
So it is a great place to start.


41
0:2:15,4 --> 0:2:19,209
But it's a terrible place to stop. 
After all, would we even know who Gandhi 


42
0:2:19,209 --> 0:2:22,299
was if he just sewed his own clothes and 
then sat back waiting for the British to 


43
0:2:22,299 --> 0:2:24,769
leave India?  


44
0:2:24,769 --> 0:2:26,899
So how do we make big change? 


45
0:2:26,899 --> 0:2:28,26
To answer that question, 


46
0:2:28,26 --> 0:2:29,97
I went back and looked at Gandhi, 


47
0:2:29,97 --> 0:2:33,74
the anti-apartheid movement in South 
Africa, the U.S. Civil Rights Movement,


48
0:2:33,74 --> 0:2:36,409
and the environmental victories here in 
the 1970s. 


49
0:2:36,409 --> 0:2:40,899
They didn't just nag people to 
perfect their day-to-day choices. 


50
0:2:40,899 --> 0:2:42,299
They changed the rules of the game. 


51
0:2:42,299 --> 0:2:46,18
It turns out, there are three things you 
find whenever people get together 


52
0:2:46,18 --> 0:2:48,319
and actually change the world. 


53
0:2:48,319 --> 0:2:52,219
First, they share a big idea for how 
things could be better. 


54
0:2:52,219 --> 0:2:54,269
Not just a little better for a few 
people, 


55
0:2:54,269 --> 0:2:56,539
a whole lot better for everyone. 


56
0:2:56,539 --> 0:2:58,699
And they don't just tinker around the 
edges; 


57
0:2:58,699 --> 0:3:2,659
they go right to the heart of the 
problem, even when it means changing


58
0:3:2,659 --> 0:3:4,289
systems that don't want to be changed. 


59
0:3:4,289 --> 0:3:6,539
And that can be scary! 


60
0:3:6,539 --> 0:3:10,9
Hey, millions of us already share a big 
idea for how things can be better. 


61
0:3:10,9 --> 0:3:13,67
Instead of this dinosaur economy that 
focuses onlyon corporate profits - 


62
0:3:13,67 --> 0:3:16,73
we want a new economy that puts safe 
products, 


63
0:3:16,73 --> 0:3:19,449
happy people, and a healthy planet first. 


64
0:3:19,449 --> 0:3:23,109
Duh, isn't that what an economy
should be  for? 


65
0:3:23,109 --> 0:3:27,459
Trying to live eco-perfectly in today's system
is like trying to swim upstream, 


66
0:3:27,459 --> 0:3:30,329
when the current is pushing us all the 
other way. 


67
0:3:30,329 --> 0:3:32,84
But by changing what our economy 
prioritizes, 


68
0:3:32,84 --> 0:3:36,9
we can change the current so that the 
right thing becomes the 


69
0:3:36,9 --> 0:3:37,959
easiest thing to do.


70
0:3:37,959 --> 0:3:42,389
Second, the millions of ordinary people 
who made these extraordinary changes 


71
0:3:42,389 --> 0:3:43,939
didn't try to do it alone. 


72
0:3:43,939 --> 0:3:48,299
They didn't just say, “I will be more 
responsible.” They said, “We will work 


73
0:3:48,299 --> 0:3:50,359
together until the problem is solved.” 


74
0:3:50,359 --> 0:3:52,869
Today it's easier than ever to work 
together. 


75
0:3:52,869 --> 0:3:57,289
Can you imagine how hard it was to get a 
message across India in 1930? 


76
0:3:57,289 --> 0:4:0,99
We can do it now in less than a second.


77
0:4:0,99 --> 0:4:3,989
And finally, these movements succeeded 
in creating change because they took 


78
0:4:3,989 --> 0:4:5,309
their big idea, 


79
0:4:5,309 --> 0:4:6,959
and their commitment to work together, 


80
0:4:6,959 --> 0:4:9,179
and then they took action! 


81
0:4:9,179 --> 0:4:12,299
Did you know that when Martin Luther 
King junior organized his march on 


82
0:4:12,299 --> 0:4:13,2
Washington, 


83
0:4:13,2 --> 0:4:15,939
less than a quarter of 
Americans supported him? 


84
0:4:15,939 --> 0:4:19,35
But that was enough to make change - 
because those supporters took action - 


85
0:4:19,35 --> 0:4:21,9
they did stuff. 


86
0:4:21,9 --> 0:4:25,589
Today 74% of Americans support 
tougher laws on toxic chemicals. 


87
0:4:25,589 --> 0:4:30,769
83% want clean energy laws. 85% think 
corporations should have 


88
0:4:30,769 --> 0:4:32,859
less influence in government. 


89
0:4:32,859 --> 0:4:37,509
We've got the big idea and the 
commitment. We just haven't 


90
0:4:37,509 --> 0:4:38,389
turned it all into massive action yet. 


91
0:4:38,389 --> 0:4:40,82
And this is our only missing piece. 


92
0:4:40,82 --> 0:4:42,469
So let's do it. 


93
0:4:42,469 --> 0:4:45,469
Making real change takes all kinds of 
citizens - 


94
0:4:45,469 --> 0:4:47,309
not just protestors. 


95
0:4:47,309 --> 0:4:50,99
When you realize what you're good at and 
what you like to do, 


96
0:4:50,99 --> 0:4:52,429
plugging in doesn't seem so hard. 


97
0:4:52,429 --> 0:4:55,749
Whatever you have to offer, a better 
future needs it. 


98
0:4:55,749 --> 0:4:57,219
So ask yourself, 


99
0:4:57,219 --> 0:4:59,619
“What kind of change maker am I?” 


100
0:4:59,619 --> 0:5:2,49
We need investigators, 


101
0:5:2,49 --> 0:5:4,949
communicators, 


102
0:5:4,949 --> 0:5:7,39
builders, 


103
0:5:7,39 --> 0:5:9,259
resisters, 


104
0:5:9,259 --> 0:5:10,879
nurturers, 


105
0:5:10,879 --> 0:5:13,349
and networkers.


106
0:5:13,349 --> 0:5:15,29
At StoryofStuff.org, 


107
0:5:15,29 --> 0:5:18,719
you can explore these types of change 
makers and find your first, 


108
0:5:18,719 --> 0:5:21,469
or your next, step to take action. 


109
0:5:21,469 --> 0:5:24,389
Being an engaged citizen starts with 
voting. 


110
0:5:24,389 --> 0:5:27,949
That's one of those basic things that 
everyone's just gotta do. 


111
0:5:27,949 --> 0:5:32,11
But it gets way more exciting - and fun 
- when we put our unique skills 


112
0:5:32,11 --> 0:5:35,179
and interests to work alongside 
thousands of others.


113
0:5:35,179 --> 0:5:39,429
I know that changing a whole economic 
system is a huge challenge. 


114
0:5:39,429 --> 0:5:42,969
It's not easy to see a clear path from 
where we are today to where we need to 


115
0:5:42,969 --> 0:5:43,889
go. 


116
0:5:43,889 --> 0:5:48,249
And there's no ten simple things we 
can do without leaving our couches! 


117
0:5:48,249 --> 0:5:51,71
But the path didn't start out clear to 
all these guys either. 


118
0:5:51,71 --> 0:5:52,96
Doctor King said, “Faith 


119
0:5:52,96 --> 0:5:57,38
is taking the first step even though 
you don't see the whole staircase.” 


120
0:5:57,38 --> 0:5:59,309
So, they worked hard to get organized, 


121
0:5:59,309 --> 0:6:2,33
practiced the small acts that 
built their citizen muscles 


122
0:6:2,33 --> 0:6:4,99
and kept their focus on their big idea - 


123
0:6:4,99 --> 0:6:7,949
and when the time was right, they were 
ready. 


124
0:6:7,949 --> 0:6:9,909
It's time for us to get ready too - 


125
0:6:9,909 --> 0:6:12,469
ready to make change and write the next 
chapter 


126
0:6:12,469 --> 0:8:12,469
in the story of stuff.
