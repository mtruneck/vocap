###22 NACHOUM: I'm originally from Israel and about 30 years ago, I came to the United States
###26 with the search of glory and who knows what else. I really wanted to learn film and television.
###32 I went to New York University and I was accepted from 350 people that tried to get in, in 1980,
###39 only 31 were accepted. Only later on I discovered that the three instructor that was actually
###45 checking us out or evaluate our ability, they were Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola and
###53 Woody Allen. I did not know any of them. In the 80, none of us know any of them, right?
###59 Anyway, but that was a long story, that's a long time ago, so I'll put this in perspective.
###64 I want to drive a taxi. That's what most Israelis or foreigner, and today it will be Indian
###69 or Pakistanian, will do it. I want to drive a taxi in New York for six months until eventually
###75 I have enough money and I started a company. And what I wanted to do really is involve
###81 myself in the water and in underwater photography, to tell the story about the ocean and what
###87 I knew about the ocean. During the time that I was driving a taxi, I was driving a taxi
###90 at night and during the daytime, I was working as a diving guide or divemaster at a dive
###97 shop in New York City. How many diver we have here? Beautiful. How many of you are photographer
###103 also, holding a camera underwater? No, it doesn't make any difference what camera. That's
###107 okay. I started from there. That's okay. That's perfectly all right. So if I speak fast, it's
###115 only because I picked my English in New York driving a taxi. So please forgive me. If my
###121 accent is difficult, I don't believe you because the 30% of Silicon Valley is all Israelis
###126 anyway. So you already have been in business with an Israeli one time or another. So to
###130 make the long story short, what I'm here, really, is to be able to share with you the
###135 story and the privilege that America gave me. I was privileged, or I am privileged perhaps,
###141 and visited over 131 nations all around the world, and believe me, there is no country
###147 in the world like this country. No matter how difficulty, no matter what the obstacles,
###152 the challenges we have, there is no country in the world and there is no Constitution
###156 like we have in America. And no surprise, we reached this level. I was able to master
###162 what you're going to see now only because either the country, the substance of this
###167 country, the foundation and the people that believe in my dream and participate and join
###172 me. As a photographer, there are two ways to go about it; either you go, you create
###178 a portfolio, you send it to so many different places to get work, or you go out and execute
###183 your own vision, my own dream. I chose the last one. I've chosen to work after my own
###189 dream and make it available. However, in the process, what became very clearly that institution,
###195 like magazine, television stations and network, were concerned that they were not able to
###201 get their money's worth for my vision and for my dream. So I went and I did it alone,
###206 trusting that people like yourself or other in America will join me, will participate
###212 in what my dream is, because I'm not any different than any one of you. We all have dreams. But
###217 some of you and me, may have seen our dreams and we can joint venture. So, I put my expertise
###223 in the field. You put your expertise among the pixels and all those nanotechnology. I
###229 put it out in the big animals. So let's go and see what I have in store for you. What
###239 you're going to see today is anthology of years and almost 30 years of having found,
###244 pushing the envelope, photographing on the edge of wilderness, comfort and common sense.
###249 And I'm not saying that lightly. I desired very much to come back again. And thank you,
###253 Vivian, again for the opportunity to work with people like yourself and to share because
###257 you are on the edge of technology. Yes, you have all the comfort in the world, but you're
###262 putting--you're pushing the envelope in what you do and that is fascinating. How we connect
###268 some of the elements in your life, some of the elements of my life, and some of the elements
###271 of somebody else and get--make a better life. And the idea in my view and my presentation
###277 today is to be able to show you or to bring to your knowledge not a specific trait, not
###281 a specific picture, but just the conglomerate issue of what the big animal, what the position
###288 they have in our culture, and what we can do, each one of our self, small world or big
###293 world, to protect them and to make them bet--to make them available for future generation.
###299 And that will be just a glory for the big animal. But that's how I--most of the time,
###304 an ugly shot like that is very unusual for me. I could not even put it in my pants because
###308 I'm too fat by now. I'm not in the water for long time ago. Not long enough. But only that's--this
###315 weekend, I'm leaving for Mexico, diving with a great white for about two weeks. And that
###320 is my backyard. And all those places that you see here are the places where images and
###327 the expedition that I'll conduct or I'm conducting all around the world. So if you go some time
###333 sooner or later to my Web site, you'll be able to see all those places one by one as
###339 they are relating. And we'll start with the polar bear. I will--all of you all probably
###346 heard and knows what the polar bear plight and all the story about the global warming.
###351 It is indeed taking effect and we don't know what will be the next generation, the next
###357 step. However, what is important to know, that the polar bear are ancestors of the grizzly
###363 and they are evolved into being polar bear only 300,000 years ago. It is not something
###368 that take, like, sharks that live in the ocean 400 million years. Polar bear only evolved
###372 in the past 300,000 years ago. So there are poses--the planet is on a continuous chase,
###379 continuous evolution, continuous--and we are part of it right now. But to understand how
###384 the polar bear live and to get close to that, that's what I do. And that's what we bring
###389 in people in small group, my team usually about only four people when we go to look
###394 at the polar bear and will give you few opportunity. So you ask me how close I was to the polar
###398 bear, almost as close as I am to the front row right now. Understanding that every animal,
###403 like human beings, we have a pattern of behavior. We have tools of how we protect, how we feed,
###409 how we make babies. Also, animals have the same pattern, similar pattern. And the polar
###413 bear in this case, its pattern or its protection is the sense of smell. So if the wind goes
###419 away from the polar bear, he will not smell when we get close to it. The question is how
###425 often I can do it. It takes a long time. You not--you'll not challenge the environment
###429 and to guess the environment, you just play together with the wind until this happen.
###434 So, usually, a trip like that may take two or three weeks, but we're able to achieve
###439 result as you see right now. Everything is timely. Everything in the environment is about
###453 time. It's about knowing exactly when the polar bear, or in this case, the animal, is
###457 on nurturing, when they are mating, when they're migrating and when they are feeding. If we
###464 know--if I know all of these, that's when I take the people with me on a trip for a
###469 small window of opportunity throughout the year. That's why I don't repeat the same trips--the
###474 same trip each year. There are only one trip of a kind every other month. But we'll be
###481 able to bring this kind of opportunity, this kind of images. Vivian, can we ask somebody
###490 to turn some of the light down so maybe the images will be seen better? I want also to
###498 take you underwater, not just top side. And I want to share with you this. Anybody knows
###502 what is that? Anybody? Yes, that's very good, Vivian. Thank you. That's the blue whale.
###510 Any--what do you know about the blue whale? Anybody? Any idea? Big? How big?
###517 >> Biggest in the world. >> NACHOUM: The biggest animal ever live on
###521 the planet. Bigger than any dinosaurs. How big is it really? How long? How long?
###526 >> Sixty feet. >> NACHOUM: Sixty feet. Any other number?
###531 >> Hundred. >> NACHOUM: Hundred-feet long, yes. And eat
###534 only plankton. There used to be about over a quarter of a million blue whales on your
###541 planet. Today, how many left? Anybody knows? Hardly 12,000; 7,000 of them in the southern
###548 hemisphere and about 5,000 on the northern hemisphere. And from the 5,000 on the northern
###553 hemisphere, about 3,000--2,500 to 3,000 along the Coast of Mexico, back of California, California
###560 and Washington State. Why? Because we have the mammal protection law in the United States
###568 that also extend into Mexico and extend further up to Canada. So, protection. And when we
###575 apply the protection, it's very helpful to support the existence of the animal and especially
###581 the big one. And that's where you see really how big is this animal. That's aerial photography,
###586 of course. The blow of the blue whale reach almost over 30 feet, 10-meter tall. Anybody
###601 knows what is that? It's beluga whales. What are called the canary of the sea. And what
###614 is that? What is that? >> A killer whale.
###617 >> NACHOUM: There is no killer whale. There's no such things. That is how we use the language
###625 and how we are mystify things and how we create bad reputation to many of the animal because
###631 of lack of knowledge. Fear. The enemy of fear, number one, is lack of knowledge. Orcas are
###639 actually dolphins. They're not even whales. There are in truth, dolphins. The name "killer
###644 whale" have been adopted to the orca only because the Englishmen that came to translate
###650 the manifest of the Spanish galleons of the 14th, 15th century could not give it any other
###656 name because the Spaniard and the Portuguese, what they wrote in the manifest, they're looking
###661 at an animal that's actually killing other whales. So they call it "killer whale." They
###666 did not give it a name yet, orca. Only later on when we start to do research, when we start
###670 to develop university along the coast of Canada, Washington, Norway and other parts of the
###678 world, then we give them name. Today, we know there are about five different species of
###682 orca in the wild. Two of them still unidentified in Antarctica and the other three that we
###687 know of are resident, transient and nomad. And each one of them is different into where
###692 which how they behave, which how--their social formation and how they feed. Those images
###698 are from Norway where we see mostly, actually, transient--not transient--we see resident
###705 orcas. Resident orca feed mostly on fish and there are a group of about 12 to 15 of them.
###711 But the--all of the citation, the dolphin and whales, are actually led by females. And
###718 same thing with the orcas. And there is not even one, not even one, accident ever happened
###725 in the wild between orca and mankind. The only time there was an accident, anybody knows
###731 where? >> SeaWorld.
###733 >> NACHOUM: Bravo. So let's close them because that's bad reputation unnecessarily. And they
###741 play without the need to have trainer and whistle and all kind of toy. They play freely
###746 in the wild. That was a moment of really unforgettable moment in the history. In my case, being in
###755 the wild for as long as I've been, and all of a sudden we had sunset in one hand, moonrise
###759 on the other hand and the orca just passed in--under the mountain and in front of the
###763 moon in Norway. Anybody knows where Norway is? Of course. We have Google Earth. And that's
###773 the beauty of the sunset together with the orcas. And anybody knows what is that? What?
###783 Great whale? What else? Humpback whales, humpback whales. Only 16,000 of them today are in the
###795 wild [INDISTINCT]. How we know all of them, I don't know for sure, but I can tell you
###801 quite from research and from all the environmental organization and the tech place, but especially
###806 after the [INDISTINCT] of the Soviet Union, we were able to get into the record of the
###812 Soviets, of the Finland, of the Norwegian, and the Iceland fishermen from the early part
###818 of the previous century and then we'll be able to put all the number together how many
###823 they have actually hunted. Not just the number they gave at a time publicly but get into
###827 the record and only then find out really how many at least they have hunted. In addition
###832 to what we have today, the science and researcher came to approximate numbers. And that is the
###838 number I'll mentioned. Today, we have more accurate information about what's left in
###843 the world. Again, not specifically, but much more accurate in a 10% to 20% margin of error,
###849 but we have about 16,000 to 20,000 compared to 500,000 and this is a result of hunting.
###854 And today, there is no reason for that whatsoever. Although, the Norwegian and the Icelandic
###859 and the Russian or the [INDISTINCT]. We can swim with them just like with the humpback,
###867 just like with the orcas, just like with, you know, close with the polar bear. Understanding,
###872 we can also actually snorkel. Actually, no scuba, no BC, no weight, just with our own
###880 air, be able to snorkel with them because snorkeling is perhaps the best activity to
###886 meet the big animal. Just like for us men, be gentle is the easiest way to get to any
###891 woman if we want to--nobody's laughing anymore--simply because big animals are most vulnerable when
###897 they are on the surface. They're on the surface because they need to breathe. And when they're
###905 there, that's the only time where we can really match and get close to them. And the moment
###910 they get to the water, they took their breath and they went underwater, after the first
###915 five feet there is no way for us humans ever to reach to get them because they are much
###918 faster, stronger than us. But when they are on the surface, then that's all a question
###923 of timing and coordination. That's why any of the expedition I lead, the photographic
###928 expedition, for the animals, are with small group. It was only four to six people only
###933 to get the maximum result and the ability not to affect the animal and not to really
###938 impose on them. Only two people at a time as we descend to the water, so the animal
###944 will be interactive with us like in these images. Or like with this image, this is a
###950 single. Among the whales, the Humpback Whale is the only one--the male actually sing to
###956 attract the female toward them. And in the water as I was mentioning before, the water
###962 are three or 800 times denser than air. So, let me ask you that, where will be the best
###968 acoustic place in the world? Carnegie Hall, the Opera House in Sydney, or underwater?
###979 Underwater. Three hundred sixty degrees, 800 times denser, any vibration that this single
###983 humpback whale will do your heart will pump together with the music. It will be actually
###987 echoing in the vacuum or in the air space that you have in your lung. It's absolutely
###994 stunning. Whale mother and calf. Again, as I mentioned, it's all a question of timing
###1000 to know in all animal--and you see that the pattern will repeat itself, either among the
###1005 orcas, among the polar bear, and among the humpback whale, it's about feeding, about
###1008 migrating and about nurturing, knowing the right timing to be able to bring this kind
###1013 of encounters between you and the animals. And the animals who come very close and anybody--we
###1019 said that we have seven photographers here. This is a very, very wide angle lens. As a
###1024 matter of fact, this is a fisheye lens, that means that I was less than one feet away from
###1028 this juvenile humpback whale that came in. It was very curios what am I doing in the
###1031 water. And that is a breach, 40 ton of animal lifts itself out of the water and we don't
###1041 know why. There is no reason that human can develop--and we say that communication, removing
###1047 parasite--we really don't know why. But they can do it and they're doing it. And that's
###1056 the classic of the tail of the humpback whale, dripping water in Alaska. Well, moving rather
###1063 along for another creature of a lot of excitement and colors. And those are the dolphins. There
###1070 are about three dozen different species of dolphin in the wild and those are--these one
###1078 in particular are--those are the bottlenose dolphin in Galapagos. This is the common dolphin,
###1085 the Atlantic common dolphin in South Africa. Of course, this is the bait ball where the
###1091 dolphins are feeding on. And what is that? What's that? Go ahead. No, no, go ahead. It's
###1101 good. What do you think is that? >> [INDISTINCT]
###1109 >> NACHOUM: [INDISTINCT], what else? >> Sailfish.
###1109 >> NACHOUM: Sailfish, what else? It is indeed a sailfish. There are about seven--there are
###1113 seven species of what they call the billfish family. There are swordfish, there are blue
###1119 marlin, there are marlin, there are stripe marlin, white marlin, sailfish and maybe one
###1125 more that I forgot at the moment. However, there wasn't any pictures of sailfish until
###1129 about four years ago. Anybody knows what happened four years ago? [INDISTINCT] remember? It
###1137 was the first time that both stories of the Blue Planet and the images of the--of this
###1142 sailfish and I was the one that actually took them out there into Mexico to dive actually
###1147 off the [INDISTINCT] 15 minutes off Cancun into the water of Isla Mujeres. If anybody
###1152 been there will know. It's a beautiful little island, very rustic it was at the time, but
###1159 today it's becoming almost like a hub after Cancun because it become very popular among
###1164 the fisherman and among the diver. After [INDISTINCT] about, everybody plunking out there. Yes?
###1168 >> How big is that? >> NACHOUM: The fish is about nine feet long
###1170 and the bill is about one-third of the whole fish. It is the fastest fish in the ocean.
###1179 It clocked at over 75 miles per hour, faster than a cheetah on the land. It is fantastic.
###1187 But the only time to catch those images, and the one that you see next, is when they're
###1192 actually coming by--they're coming into Mexico to this particular part of the water in a
###1199 particular time of the year, in January, February, to feed on the Brazilian sardine. And here
###1205 as you see is the bait ball of the sardine. Nobody knew. And, you know, a lot of fisherman
###1210 going for many, many, many years, [INDISTINCT] and the rest, have been catching those sailfish
###1214 and those marlin in Cuba, in Mexico, in Peru, everywhere else. But hardly anybody until
###1220 four years ago--actually, not hardly, it's clearly, nobody with a camera went to the
###1226 water about four or five years ago--five years ago when I went, I called the BBC and when
###1231 they did Blue Planet, they call [INDISTINCT] okay, put us together with the story and we
###1234 set up the set-up. And that is the evidence. We told you about bait ball. Bait ball happened
###1242 many different parts of the world all the time, especially in the remote island. In
###1246 this case, off Galapagos. Anybody been in Galapagos before besides Vivian? You, have
###1248 you been all the way in Darwin and Wolf? >> No, no.
###1250 >> NACHOUM: No? Then most don't--northern island.
###1252 >> I don't know. >> NAHCOUM: You don't know. There is two island
###1255 up north of the equator of [INDISTINCT] called Darwin and Wolf. The middle of nowhere, 600
###1260 mile from any land and 100 mile north of Galapagos itself, they are a part of Galapagos. And
###1269 they are [INDISTINCT] there's no land. They need to feed. They need food. And the food
###1276 is in the water, so all with sea birds. And when you watch well enough, you'll be able
###1284 to see eventually the birds feeding and then the tuna feeding underwater on a bait ball.
###1291 And those are actually yellowtail tuna [INDISTINCT] fish actually use its bill, like the baseball
###1315 bat used in a baseball game. They actually hit the fish with the bill. They move it like
###1320 that all the time into the school. But only one sailfish at a time. All the other sailfish
###1324 will wait until one finish and then it come the second round of like it [INDISTINCT] moving
###1330 very, very fast. And just like this one. Anybody heard about the BBC Wildlife Competition of
###1338 the Year? The Photographer of the Year? So about three years ago, this picture took the
###1342 first place in the underwater photography. This was the moment as--again, very fast fish,
###1348 very fast action. And to catch it when he took the bait or to take the bait in its mouth,
###1356 it was very--I was, I guess very lucky to be able to capture it and bring it alive.
###1361 And this picture taken actually from the side of my shoulder. That's no manipulation and
###1367 no Photoshop-ing and nothing, any other elements. It's just the way it is, captured in camera
###1374 at one time. And after everybody has seen the bait and you see the blood that actually
###1380 already--the fish already bleeding between the two parts of the bill. What is that? Great
###1392 white. What does it do? Breaching out of the water. It was very--it was a situation that
###1400 was up until seven or eight years ago, nobody knew of--or if we knew about it, nobody reported
###1406 or did anything about it. This actually happened only in South Africa. The great white breach
###1411 also other places but not to such extraordinary behavior. The reason why exactly we don't
###1417 know, but the purpose of the great white breaching is because they are looking after there actually
###1422 seals that moving out from the island in early part of the morning. So in order to do that,
###1428 after a year or two or three observing that, it become clear that the great white, just
###1433 like all other predators, like all other master of their ability are very conservative animal
###1440 despite their power, despite the uniqueness ability that nature gave to them. They are
###1445 not a man eater. They are not eat anything they see. They are very methodical. There
###1452 is an island just off Cape Town called Seal's Island, about 45,000 to 60,000 seals on it.
###1460 Come January and they give birth, the seal population give birth. The population rise
###1465 to about almost 60,000. The adult will have to go to sea to bring more fish for them for
###1471 food. And [INDISTINCT] July, this is where the most migration of a big and the bigger
###1477 seals go out to sea. The shark will arrive around Seal Island around May, June and wait
###1483 for the opportunity. Seal's Island, it is relatively deep. If you go to the water there
###1486 is a steep cliff, it goes to about 40, 60 feet before it reach the bottom and that's
###1493 how they rise out of the surface. The great white patrol around it, especially in the
###1499 morning hours. And exactly like all surfer. When surfer go to sea? Early morning and late
###1505 afternoon. When the shark operate? Early morning, late afternoon. Why? The sun hardly rise over
###1512 the horizon, the angle of the sun over the horizon is the angle of penetration into the
###1516 water, the light. So the lesser the angle, or the more angle, lesser, lesser activity.
###1523 But a shark can see there is a light on the surface, the shark [INDISTINCT] on the surface.
###1530 The seal cannot see the shark underwater because there's not enough light. Beside the shark
###1536 on the back of it, it's dark over like the water, totally stealth. The shark will go
###1542 straight up 40 feet to accelerate and to catch the seal. The seal don't know what hit it.
###1551 Come the light, eight, nine o'clock in the morning, the operation or the nature went
###1553 to sleep, until later on four or five o'clock in the evening again. In order to be able
###1562 to do that, we have to emulate the behavior of the seal and we tow behind [INDISTINCT]
###1567 a dummy, a plastic or a rubber dummy, about 20 feet away from the boat and wait for the
###1571 moment for the shark to jump out and here you go. So three years ago in the BBC competition,
###1576 the Photographer of the Year, this also had the first place in animal behavior. And [INDISTINCT]
###1586 get close to the animal and to bring really the behavior be able to put almost--not almost,
###1591 I put actually--the camera was in the mouth of the shark and take it away and be able
###1598 to bring the images back. Because understanding how the shark operate, and that's because
###1600 of this understanding, I, next week as Vivian knows and hopefully she'll join me next year--when
###1605 we go to Mexico and there is a great white, there is one thing that all operator do continuously
###1612 including Discovery, we do the very unethical things. It is challenging the shark, actually
###1620 teasing them and irritating them, by putting blood and chum in the water to take them to
###1623 the camera. But if you don't put chum or blood and not take it away from them, the shark
###1632 will care less and they'll swim around me, just like I'm a piece of nothing in the water.
###1633 And you don't believe me, am I right? Let's see. That's the animal that was captured in
###1642 our imagination. That's the animal that the media wanted to use so badly. That's the image,
###1647 Discovery have used this exact image. In '93, they used this as a poster. They turned it
###1654 vertical, they make it a poster and all over the front of buses and all over New York,
###1659 California and Texas and Chicago to promote the Shark Week. But the truth of the matter
###1665 is that we don't use blood because this is the prey, what you see here, are the seals.
###1671 Well, that's what they feed on. If we don't use chum and blood in the water, we can sit
###1676 on the edge of comfort and against common sense because there is nothing to do with
###1686 what we've been feed. We can swim openly, freely, safely with a great white. However,
###1693 if we'll not be too bravado or too macho's or imposing our superiority, perhaps superiority
###1702 over the wilderness. On the contrary, living with the wilderness like making love to nature,
###1708 make love with nature, nature will be able to show us some most amazing moments just
###1717 like this. And this is not again, no touched and not expended and not been blown, it is
###1726 over 50 millimeter lens. Especially I use this lens in order to bring the image of the
###1732 shark and distort it. All photographers know, and if you don't know, of anytime you go to
###1737 a movie and you see anything, lenses have the ability actually to distort the images.
###1743 There is depth of field. There is shallow depth of field, a [INDISTINCT] depth of field
###1748 and distort the images because of what they call the false perspective. But when we take
###1754 a 50 millimeter lens, which is almost like exactly what we see in our own eyes, we'll
###1760 be able to get this particular images. And that's a picture that one of my client took
###1766 of me swimming with a great white last year. Face to face as I'm closest to the people
###1773 on the front row. And that's the image I got in my camera. And I allow the shark to come
###1781 even closer toward me. This is another photographer. That's even close, half the distance between
###1786 us two. And that's the image I got then. So if the movie created such--how do you call
###1800 it, memories in our mind, I have to do--to try to do the same thing, rather the opposite,
###1807 remove this negative and be able to share with you the knowledge how this happened and
###1813 how to avoid it, or what to participate if you want to participate in something that
###1817 has the positive effect on your life, on the life of the animal, and the life of nature.
###1822 But not only to the great white, we come even closer with this. Anybody know what is that?
###1826 >> The whale shark. >> NACHOUM: The whale shark. How big is the
###1833 whale shark? >> Huge.
###1834 >> NACHOUM: How huge is huge? It's not as huge as Google. But how huge is huge? It's
###1838 about 40, 45 feet long. One of the three or four different species of shark that feed
###1846 only on plankton and it's the largest of all the shark species. So it does not have to
###1853 eat meat in order to be large. You can eat plankton and you are the largest. Which is
###1859 bring another problem altogether, it is not necessarily the place right now, but the over
###1863 fishing of plankton in the southern ocean in and around Antarctica by the country like
###1869 the Soviet Union, China and other, and they use that mostly for fertilization and food
###1877 for their animal stocks. That is becoming a problem because they are competing practically
###1883 with the albatross which are in decline and of course with all the large whale, the blues,
###1888 the sei, the fin whale, the humpback, and all of the other whale that actually go to
###1892 the Antarctica to feed during the summertime, in Antarctica summer time, our winter time.
###1895 And here is the example of the size of this mouth of this animal together with the driver
###1902 just beside that. It could swallow it very easily but it does not really happen. We can
###1911 imagine whatever we want to imagine. And, of course, these stories and this stigma of
###1916 this very prehistoric look like of them, of the hammerhead sharks, out of Galapagos. When
###1920 you see them in great numbers, sometime hundreds together, but very--and then unusual shape
###1925 of the head, and the eyes all together by the side, but they come very, very close to
###1933 the reef and they are waiting for their--actually for the butterflyfish to come and to clean
###1938 them and they open mouths like--just like we see it in a barber shop waiting for the
###1943 opportunity to somebody come clean and give us a good time. There you are. But that's
###1953 the drama that you're looking for. That's the event, the phenomenal event, that you're
###1957 looking for. The schooling Hammerhead, sometime hundred to a thousand. It could be three,
###1964 five, sometime up to seven, eight minutes parade of those school and they are in the
###1968 distance between me and the third--the second or the third row from here. Or this, or this.
###1979 Anybody knows what is that? >> Ray.
###1981 >> NACHOUM: Ray, what kind of ray? They are mobula rays. They are not mantas, they are
###1987 mobula rays. They are smaller in size and they feed also on plankton and they move in
###1991 a big crowd. In this case, about 40 or 50 of them at one time off the coast of Galapagos
###1996 Island again. And this is the manta ray. This is the Oceanic manta ray or the giant manta
###2002 ray, almost 20 feet from wing tip to wing tip. And this is, not a sailfish, what is
###2015 that? Striped marlin. A striped, yes. It's a marlin and there's--it's that marlin about
###2025 almost 12 feet, about 2 feet larger than the sailfish. And again, the bill is about one-third
###2030 of the fish, the fish length. They are as fast as a sailfish and they are--you can find
###2036 them in exactly opposite side of Mexico. If the sailfish was found out in the Caribbean,
###2042 then the marlin we would find out in the Atlanta--in the Pacific of Cabo San Lucas. And let's see
###2049 how the marlin feed. The marlin feed a lit bit different than the sailfish. And as you
###2056 see, as the marlin here coming in to the school, actually he use his bill like we use the chopsticks.
###2062 Anybody knows how to eat with chopsticks? You remove one sushi at a time, right? Look
###2071 at the fish--the picture is not very clear, unfortunately, but in--on the edge of the
###2072 bill, you'll see one of the sardine and then it took it. It's the last day of the life
###2086 of this sardine. It is fun being in the water. It's joy. The water actually will carry you.
###2097 As long as you just not fight with it, just let the water do what the water does and get
###2104 along with it, the water will just carry you like being in the womb of the mother. Seventy
###2109 percent or more of our planet is ocean. Seventy percent of the planet is giving us over 50%
###2116 of the oxygen that we breathe on. And we polluted it galore. Anybody--most of you heard about
###2124 the plastic island that we have somewhere in the middle of the Pacific Ocean all the
###2127 way throughout Japan. And all the pollution that we throw into the water, factories from
###2132 all over the country, including United States, and all the other developing country, we have
###2137 to do something about it because there is no place as beautiful as--look at these images.
###2141 Look at this coloration. Look at the animal that's suffering, animal that we can relate
###2146 to. They are our size, a turtle, we can relate to one to one. They are happy to be where
###2153 they are. How can we continue contaminate, or really continue avoid playful with them?
###2159 They are part of a playground. This is--I showed you the world of the--the map of the
###2165 world, that's my playground. I don't have to go to Yosemite only, the ocean, the rest
###2169 of the world is our playground. And they are beautiful things out there to play with. Like
###2176 those seals in the kelp of South Africa or the narwhal out in the high Arctic or the
###2188 pink dolphin from the Amazon river. Even the anaconda. I know the movie create such drama
###2197 and such a--it's a piece of cake, fortunately, understanding that anaconda doesn't feed underwater.
###2203 They feed on the land. But they don't feed underwater. And then would do nothing. We
###2215 swim with them, 24-feet long animal. This is how we find some of the animals in the
###2225 ocean. We cannot see into the water but we can use the same understanding that the old
###2231 generation had. We don't need sophistication and we don't need the Google Ocean to find
###2235 out where are the service because Google Ocean doesn't know unless I tell them. And that's
###2245 what happen when you look from the surface into the water, half over, half under. The
###2251 birds on top, the sailfish on the bottom, and between them are the bait ball or are
###2256 the sardines. Going to Antarctica. We're not necessarily going to be like Titanic. It happened
###2267 once in history. We learned the lessons. We dive under the ice, which is like diving in
###2273 a palace. And we see these amazing vistas of the continent that's totally frozen. It
###2286 go through changes like everything else. It goes through out the changes. But we have
###2290 the gear. We have the equipment. We are knowledgeable. And this exist if you just reach out a little
###2295 bit farther away from the normal life and be able to do those things, they're very unusual
###2299 things, and to see these unusual places. Look how small we are under this planet that's
###2307 called ocean. And this is the edge of the ice and what we see under the ice, those jellyfish.
###2320 That's how the old generation were looking and listening to whales, and before they arrive
###2326 into the crack in the ice. Those are the Inuit guide. And with those guys will be working
###2328 in the field, on the edge of wilderness, to be able to bring different kinds of experiences
###2335 rather than drive in the freeways of America or sitting at Starbuck, we're sitting on the
###2340 edge of the ice, in a tent, for three weeks, looking for polar bear or looking for the
###2343 narwhal. And those are the guys who'd be able to tell us exactly because they don't have
###2349 navigation, hardly ever a satellite phone working there. And the walruses. And the lonely
###2358 walrus that went to die and she moved away just like the Indian, the American Indian,
###2364 you will leave the--she would leave the home and go by herself into farther way in the
###2367 ice and look at the size of those tusks, she was probably about 11 or 12 years old which
###2373 is the maximum that walrus could live and she went to die by herself, away from everybody
###2381 else. And mother and calf. On the edge of comfort, wilderness, and on the edge of noise.
###2398 Two hundred fifty thousand of king penguin of the island of South Georgia. And sorry,
###2400 if my English is believable--just staggering from the smell, from the noise, and from the
###2402 vistas altogether. And only one place on the planet you see something like that. And it's
###2410 one of the most beautiful island you will ever see and that's is the, you call it the--I
###2422 call it the Grandiose (ph) as they stand up, as we lower ourselves down, it's about 30
###2427 inch--about 30 inch tall, 32 inches tall, laid myself down and looked at the mountain
###2429 behind, which was over almost 2,000 feet, and the penguin in front of us, they are the
###2436 king. They are just--give you a chance. That's a reason to live. That's a reason to breathe,
###2443 to do something so fascinating. Who'd designed anything like that with those colors, with
###2445 those wings, and able to swim in the water and to walk on the land, all at the same time.
###2462 Looking for predators, waiting to be eaten. But there is a predator roaming around the
###2468 ice and the only one of it's kind. And we are all ready to catch his--its picture. We're
###2475 all ready for the moment. And they want to know--anybody knows what is that? Leopard
###2480 seals, the only predator that is in Antarctica. And actually, very interestingly, only during
###2487 two months it feed on penguins, on meat, on meals, on meat. The rest of the time of the
###2495 year, they feed on plankton. And look at the size of the teeth, the canine teeth and the
###2499 grinding teeth, that this animal got. Mother Nature is very, very unique. The animal look
###2504 like a prehistoric. It's a nine feet, 9 to 12 feet, long. And it is powerful and it's
###2511 fast. It's so agile. It's second that we'd never seen anything like that. And very curious
###2518 by--as diver being together in the water with them. They are a perfect hunter. But this
###2527 is also a perfect places for people like all of us, clear, fresh water and 300 foot visibility
###2541 or more that you notice in Mexico. And, of course, among the big animal we cannot forget
###2549 the gorillas out in Rwanda, or the lion and the buffalos in Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania.
###2556 Anybody knows what is that? And what is this? What is this? This is the cheetah. And so
###2568 what is that? Leopard, right. Well, we're getting somewhere. And I'm getting away from
###2572 you guys. This is on--anybody knows Argentina? Peninsula Valdes? Anybody heard about Peninsula
###2580 Valdes? A world heritage site is in--actually, a peninsula completely closed to--stopped
###2586 to be developed by the World Heritage Foundation and there are only one--for one particular
###2597 reason, there are group of orcas that still, the only place in the world, which they will
###2603 come in and feed by stranding themselves on the beaches and take the seals out of the
###2608 beach. And if you seen the latest movies of Disney, and they are some section in this
###2612 particular place when the orca come on the beach and take the animals away. Once in every
###2614 two or three years I run a special trip out there and that's the edge of the place in
###2620 Peninsula Valdes. And then one of the gauchos there had arrived in horse and sees I'm an
###2629 Israeli, he's the only one that let me ride on a horse and it was this, I guess, going
###2636 just to--I got another native images from the island of Palau--on the island of Yap
###2641 in the Pacific. And to let you know that all these images are taken actually in the natural
###2651 setting and all the animal depicted here are free and wild. None of them been fed. None
###2655 of them been trained. None of them in captivity. All in the wilderness and all are there somewhere
###2661 in the ocean that you can be able to see if you'll join me. If you are--if you're interested
###2666 in any of the trips, either photography or expeditions or want to know more, one of the
###2670 best place to find information is, one of the best place besides National Geographic
###2674 or Noah (ph) is to find from--on my website, BigAnimals.com. All right. Any questions?
###2684 Yes? >> Do you have an incoming trip that we can
###2690 join? >> NACHOUM: Yes, trip that you can join. This
###2693 open--that's open to the public. That's the reason I ask you. If any of you, please, before
###2698 you leave, just fill me up then--there's a card that I left with you, I'll be able to
###2699 continue to be in touch with you. As today, as you know today, by the media--not the media
###2704 but the network or the server are not allow us to send mass mailing to people unless people
###2710 give us the permission to use and to send you an email. I cannot do that anymore. Otherwise,
###2717 they will not let--if they--if you're email is not certified that I've received it from
###2720 you I cannot use it. So if you want to receive information, I'll be delighted to send you
###2724 but only through these cards. Any more questions? Yes.
###2728 >> Have you ever been hurt? >> NACHOUM: Only in my heart. I was hurt once
###2735 and that is the result only of human error. I was hurt once by, actually, by walrus. When
###2739 you operate with the walrus, you need to have, I need to have always a back-up with me, somebody
###2746 watching my back because as you saw on the images, the walrus is mostly on the iceberg,
###2756 but there are other walruses will just coming back home. And usually mother and calf, that's
###2764 the season. So we got off the boat. I got first with my camera, I'm ready to go, and
###2785 the safety divers supposed to come behind me. He did and I did not pay attention, I
###2800 continue moving because when you are with a camera, you're going to work, your safety
###2811 diver is supposed to be behind you. He went to the water but unfortunately he lost his
###2811 tank. The tank was fall off of the carry, of the BC, so he was delayed getting to me.
###2811 I did not know that. I'm looking at the--to where the iceberg where the walruses were.
###2811 And all of the sudden, I felt something strange. About, you know, you sometimes you a sixth
###2812 or seventh sense or ninth sense? The hair out in your back stand up and you know something
###2812 is wrong. And I looked to my side and this female was very, very close toward me. And
###2813 she had a cub with her. So she's clearly going for me because she was very close with the
###2813 tusk. If I will stay where I am, all this area will be the most sensitive area of humankind
###2813 will be affected. I turned my butt and she nabbed me on my butt. She made a hole in the
###2820 dry suit and then I got flooded with water, got up and put air in my BC, and she came
###2831 again. But the second time when she came again, I turned around and then we had a distance
###2833 and I could raise my head with my leg with my fin and it was a distance between us, she
###2833 understood that I'm not after her. She continued and I took her picture and she went home.
###2835 But that's the only time that really we'll get close to be hurt. It is--that's what I
###2843 do. That's what people do when--I have over 30 years of immaculate record, but managing
###2850 risk. Well, as you probably--as I mentioned to you before, I'm from Israel. I was an officer
###2855 in the military about almost 12 years in the Special Forces. Managing risk, it is what
###2861 we do, what we learn to do. It doesn't make any difference. It's not necessary be uniform.
###2866 It's not necessary to be guns. It's not necessary--it is knowing, understanding what the risk you
###2871 are facing and how to manage it and to avoid it. But how to reach the goal that you want
###2875 to despite this element is knowledge is the enemy of all fear. And that's the key. The
###2882 more knowledge, the more experience in the field. Every time pushing the envelope just
###2886 one step--don't let the envelope break because if you blow in it too hard, it will break.
###2892 Push it one step at a time and be able to see the result, measure it and move again,
###2896 and retreat. If you need to retreat, it is a very proud things to do. Retreat, it is
###2902 not a defeat. And defeat is when you're not be able to stand here and share with you the
###2905 experiences. Any more question? Yes. >> [INDISTINCT] you mentioned that [INDISTINCT].
###2915 >> NACHOUM: It is about being a long time in the field. Yes, just being in the field.
###2919 I did not learn in any other way. I did not have, sorry to say or good to say, I did not
###2923 have education. But the education was in a knock--with real knock of life. I paid dearly
###2929 for that. But, again, thank for America for the ability. I borrowed the money. I was able
###2934 to return--pay back and that's what gave me the chance to learn, being in the field. And
###2939 if you read the bio that Vivian put together, in any of the trip I ran as a businessman,
###2945 I realized in order for me to gain anything I had to have the leader of the world in their
###2953 businesses; either marine biology, research, photography, to be co-host with me on the
###2955 trip. I learned from them while I went along. Yes?
###2971 >> But what about the [INDISTINCT]. >> NACHOUM: You just said it. You just also
###2983 yourself--very, very close to the subject. You cannot have powerful enough strobe to
###2988 match the light from the sun. When you work with wide angle lens versus working with a
###2995 macro, wide angle lens may be capturing a lot space, you have to count on the ambient
###3000 light. The strobe you bring in is only like a painter bring a brush over, just to highlight
###3006 several elements. You touch a very interesting point and I'll take one more minute. I learned
###3012 photography not in photography classes, not in photography school, not from any photographer.
###3017 I learned from the people which their--which their prints or images sell for millions.
###3023 Anybody can give two names of--or three names of people that their picture of prints sell
###3029 for millions? [INDISTINCT] photographer, print, painter, painter that sell for million. They
###3039 are the best teacher in the world. [INDISTINCT] Van Gogh, Monet, all those--and those picture
###3047 are for free. You go to any museum in the world and you could sit for hours and watch.
###3050 Not what they're try to tell you as a photographer but only how they paint the light. Guys, painter
###3059 have the difficult, have a difficult job to do. They have only white canvas. They have
###3064 to create everything to put on the canvas; the color, the position, the composition,
###3067 everything else. As an underwater photographer, I have exactly opposite challenge. I have
###3074 the most creative photo--painter in the world and creator. He put everything in the water.
###3077 The only thing He did not put in the water is the white light because the water--light
###3084 absorbs through the water very fast and the first 30 feet, you have--you don't see any
###3089 more red, no yellows and only green and blue. So as a photographer, my task is how to bring
###3096 the light out and how to understand the light. And the second job is if I--I don't have a
###3098 canvas, so--but what I have is a lens and to select what part of the animal or the scenery
###3102 I see that I want to capture to share with you. That's the parallel, that's how I look
###3114 at it. I was sitting hours, honestly and looking at the prints or painting of the great painters
###3123 to understand what they've done and that's what I took with me to the water. But not
###3130 because of a photographer because I don't think you can learn photography unless you
###3133 do it. And unless you put it out of the market to sell and you see what people react and
###3137 how they buy and how they react to the images as some of you reacted today.
###3142 >> Can you tell us your proudest image? And can you talk about the image that you missed?
###3151 >> NACHOUM: I cannot tell you about images that I missed because then I'll be very sorry.
###3154 That is indeed the dilemma that all photographer deal with because nobody at home know what
###3161 we went through or what I gone through. There are moments that we miss, but these are not
###3164 the moment that we dwell on, it's the moment where we learn the mistakes or we learn what
###3170 we did not know at the time and how it make it better. But I can tell you the moment which
###3175 I'm proud of is like the breach in great white or like the one with the striped marlin with
###3179 the fish in its mouth. It's timely second to none and that is what make the difference
###3184 in still photography versus when you do video. The anaconda, the anaconda was swimming in
###3189 actually in barren river until it eventually came over the green grass. And I was waiting
###3194 for that. You take back all the time with Mother Nature. So you miss a lot of different
###3201 things. I missed several images of the narwhal as they come in towards--as you saw the narwhal
###3207 with the tusk out. There were other images which I totally missed. Then there are images
###3211 that--of a polar bear that actually was--he had a prey and put his paws over the prey
###3217 and rolled it over. But I changed lenses at that time. You miss. But nobody know those
###3225 images except we have to live with it. And we do. Next time, we do better and better
###3230 and better. And that's the challenge. That's what keep me doing it compared to being in
###3234 the military and wearing uniform and commanding and running after. But that's the challenge,
###3239 the excitement and the productivity, and the beauty you bring to the world rather than
###3244 sorrow and pain. Yes? >> [INDISTINCT]
###3250 >> NACHOUM: The million dollar question. I really don't know. I know I don't take many
###3258 pictures while I'm shooting. I don't take many. No, I don't take many because it is
###3261 a mind set. Again, remember the painter I talked to you about? They knew what they're
###3266 going to paint. Da Vinci, Angelo, Rembrandt, Monet, all of them, Van Gogh, [INDISTINCT]
###3271 they knew what they're going to paint. They elaborate about their painting, about their
###3275 colors and what they do, until eventually they get what they want. I think the same
###3280 because I start from the school of film, not from the school of digital. Digital can shoot
###3285 305--800,000 images in one count. I start with the school of 36 frame so I have to be
###3292 very methodical in the way which how--what is the subject about to choose, what I'm looking
###3298 for. And the best photography, in my view, in photograph--in icon images are images that
###3305 you saw before you photograph it or you thought you're going to see and what happens is Mother
###3312 Nature in most time have actually outdid my own imagination and gave me a present bigger
###3315 than any. Like the image of the blue whale on the back of the card. You said the image
###3321 of the blue whale with the fin open is an image that I've seen earlier in the--about
###3331 '87 or '87 or '88 in National Geographic by Flip Nicholin. And there's an image of a fin
###3337 whale across the two pages with a beautiful sunset in Baha. I really wanted to have this
###3344 image or really--but as a good person, we don't copy, we emulate. We don't copy. So
###3352 when I went eventually to Baha in the mid-90 and tried to get my own image, when the blue
###3353 whale was just a foot of us, I had to make a decision, either I'm going to take the picture
###3354 of the whole blue whale or half of it because it's so big the lens could not take it or
###3366 find something else. And all of the sudden, this blue whale actually was resting on the
###3371 surface. It allowed me to think for a moment and to be fast if I could, because that's
###3375 the human element, and move toward the tail which is much more powerful rather than the
###3380 whole body, which would be very long and not distinguished, but over the tail and look
###3387 over the horizon and see the island. And that was a gift. It is not something that I could
###3391 dream about. I was impressed by the image that I've seen in '87, but Mother Nature at
###3392 that moment, if I was not open to receive the information that's given to me, I would
###3401 not see it. I'll just do the same thing as other people did and move on. But at the moment
###3409 you look at other opportunities. Always look at other opportunities. Just like Google does.
###3420 Honestly, you guys, or whoever managing and running and driving you, they are just brilliant.
###3427 Never had about bait ball. So you--that means that you have to join me because that's what
###3433 I'm looking for. The bait ball is where the action is. Most of diving trip, most trip,
###3439 period, take people into places which is very usual and very common and they put down to
###3447 walk either to see the Louvre, either to see the Eiffel, or either to see--jump to the
###3449 water, if you go diving, to see the reef, the coral reef, the clown fish and the eels,
###3453 and the so on and so forth. But they are not focusing, not willing to take the risk, to
###3458 see something which not predictable. Bait ball is not predictable. There is time and
###3464 places around the world that could happen. That is where I put my effort. You will have
###3469 to look for an operator that is really looking for something like that to be able to give
###3473 you the opportunity. Oh, why is the ball? Because the small fish, like people, when
###3479 there is an explosion they all run together. They hug each other for protection. So they
###3484 all get together very, very tight. They hope they will not be taken by the predators because
###3488 they will be in the center of the group. But the group is turning around and everybody
###3494 want to be on the center. So is everybody in and out, in and out and that's the bait
###3501 ball. The bait because the bigger fish come feed on them. Then come the tuna, and then
###3502 come the dolphin, and then come the sharks, and the berets on the top, and a photographer
###3507 like us come and take their picture. Any more question? Yes.
###3513 >> [INDISTINCT] >> NACHOUM: I love film. I grew up on film.
###3516 But there's no film yet anymore almost to be processed, especially slides, to be processed
###3522 and to get the result. And digital today really, coming to an age of excellent in delivering
###3531 good--delivering quality. So it's a toast. It is just because I raise on film and the
###3537 black and white and the color and we like some of the nuances that the cut--that the
###3540 film has, but the dynamic range of a digital reaching to the level of quality of what film
###3546 did. So in the next year or two or three, we'll have digital perhaps even suppress film
###3554 and we have to deal with that. If you heard about HDR, yes? HDR prints have remarkable
###3559 details in images that we could not do in film. So there is a--there is a positive progression
###3567 and increasing value and increasing quality. Any more, guys? I'm sorry?
###3575 >> [INDISTINCT] >> NACHOUM: I used to carry more than one
###3581 camera, yes. But in today because of the digital, I'd--you don't need. You have 800, a thousand
###3586 frames you can shoot on those 32 gigabyte cards, you can do video at the same time,
###3591 so it's one lens in my kind of work, specialty on the big animals, so only one camera. When
###3598 you go to work on the reef, it's a different story. Because when we work with big animal,
###3604 we are in an open ocean. It's wild, it's wilderness. The encounter could be very short, like, maybe
###3610 30 seconds or it can be even half an hour. But over--but you have only one subject, one
###3614 big subject to photograph, so only one lens will work well. But when you work on the reef
###3620 it's a different story because in the reef you have other elements that you can photograph.
###3622 It will be a seal. It would be a sea fin. It will be sponges. It will be the clown fish.
###3628 It will be the fish giving birth or the fish laying eggs. It's different cameras you want
###3637 to carry with you. And also when you are working on a reef, you're going to be on shallow water;
###3639 30, 40, 60 feet. You can stay much longer. Hour, hour and a half, two hours, if you are
###3647 on night treks without problem and then give you--but you want to have more cameras, even
###3651 digital, yes. It's all in the line of work. It's like everything else. You have a computer,
###3656 and you have a handheld, and you have the iPod, and the whatever. The same thing in
###3661 a photography, it's only tools to do the job and know about the job you want to do, or
###3667 if you have a fan and you want--you have a particular vision, how to keep your vision
###3670 and bring it to light. Thank you very much. Or any more question? Who is coming on a trip
###3680 to--this weekend? We're going to do a great white swimming in and out of the cage. All
###3685 right. Thank you very much, guys.
