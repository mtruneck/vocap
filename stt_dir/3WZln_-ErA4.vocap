###4 Well Jim , we are still gaining a few people but, we're pretty close to
###7 launch at this stage of the game
###9 and we will be able to rock and roll here.
###14 Like at all our Extension meetings, as our gentlemen know that were on our
###17 2009 dairy days, we start on time and end on time. So, we really
###21 want to respect to your time. commitments as well.
###25 So,
###26 we're just about ready to to launch here, are we not Jim?
###29 According to my watch, I've got about
###34 a minute to go.
###35 We had about 150 people indicating interest for signing up for it.
###39 Some locations have more than a couple of people at a couple of universities had indicated
###43 were never going to pull in and I know of one feed company that thinking also
###46 of utilizing the information.
###50 We will see where it goes from there and our list just keeps keeps getting
###56 longer and that's exciting to see.
###59 Good news Jim! The price is right and I'll be honest with you, we were kinda
###63 hoping that maybe the webinar is method
###66 that we may explore even further here in the future and that's all you are well
###70 aware of state budgets certainly at Illinois and Extension are really really tight and
###74 at some point this may go cost-recovery.
###77 Which means there will be a fee attached to this and you should be thinking about
###80 that. There will be a survey at the end, I believe,
###83 that's going to ask the questions.
###87 This time we are not going to ask that but, the question is do you see value in this
###90 and sometime in the future, maybe it will be Dave's webinar.
###93 We will ask if you would  pay a dollar or would you pay
###96 five dollars for it
###98 or something like that. At this point where he's trying to get our feet wet
###101 and and hopefully we don't have too many glitches today.
###104 This is our first launch and we have our IT group here. Jim Baltz leads that
###108 group here and there are a couple others along with us.
###111 Louann Wilcox and in Jen Roth. They're all players in this one as well
###117 and then of course online you'll hear Dave Fisher bit later and Dick
###122 Wallace. So, they'll be part of this as a resource people
###125 they have microphones turned out so if have a specific health question
###127 Dr. Wallace it would to be very logical if he first took a
###132 look at it. If we get some questions in terms of
###135 forages and facilities and things like that obviously Dave Fisher would be
###139 a logical choice andof course you can also type in answers,
###143 questions, and comments
###144 as you go on as well.
###146 So, I think we ar ready to go. Are we not Jim?
###150 We want to welcome everybody to the first University of Illinois, Dairy webinar!
###155 Co-sponsored with DAIReXNET.
###157 At this point our topic is feeding challenges with todays milk prices.
###161 We all know that it's pretty a hot topic at least here in the United States. I think our
###164 Canadian colleagues have to feel
###166 a little more reassured  but Im not sure about our colleagues in China
###169 and places like that.
###170 We have several different countries represented here today and so hopefully
###173 you will
###174 find value for that.
###176 I'll be driving the power points here today
###178 and as we mentioned earlier we are going to have a second one
###181 and you'll see this at the end of the program as well but we thought we'd
###184 just indicate that we'd like to try this again. You can see the the date,
###189 the time, and the player
###190 listed up there and there's the registration URL or if you are
###194 somewhat motivated,
###195 click on that just like you did for this one here today.
###198 So lets go and get moving on if we can and I'll get into this.
###201 and this slides says
###202 "Economic Expectations" and maybe the worst should be survival.
###206 at this stage of the game. Notice the work profit doesn't pop up here because most dairymen
###210 now in the Midwest and the U.S. see no profit at all.
###214 The bad news now is that milk prices have dropped 5 dollars per hundred-weight and in some areas
###217 ever higher than that because of their
###220 blend prices.
###221 The good news, feed prices have also drop somewhat from before
###225 when we were back at
###226 7 dollar a bushel of corn
###228 and some of these higher feed price. So, there's a little bit help there as well.
###232 If you're milking a less than about a 130 cows the MILC program, this is the
###236 milk income lose
###238 program that's done by the government is now available, you see
###242 that will help us out a little bit.
###243 The bad news is that we saw this in fact on the news in Illinois,
###247 if you want to call the good news, switch about a 100 dollars per
###251 month is what we're looking at kind of a lose.
###253 The folks out in  New Mexico and Arizona just last week said the numbers
###258 close to a 150 dollars per cow per month.
###261 There is some liquidation going on at this stage of the game.
###265 I'm going to my next power point that looks at
###267 one of the questions we have a one like, when might this thing turn around?
###270 Folks, there really is a pretty good news on that one to be vey honest.
###273 Perhaps, I will update that
###275 for you right now.
###276 The first quarter of these were the projections, just literally
###280 a week ago, the first quarter
###282 of 2009 this is class 3 milk just be well aware.
###286 We will get into the details on that but, for us in Illinois we'll probably
###290 put 1 dollar, 1.50 dollar, to maybe 2 dollars on top of that depending on the
###293 blend price and the differential and from the quality premiums and milk components.
###298 The second quarter eleven 11.24, the good news is,
###302 we just found this yesterday the milk went up
###305 to its max level.
###307 and those of you who want to go online right now we now have it in May, June and July.
###312 As of today we're looking at are almost 12.50 to 13.00
###316 dollar milk.
###317 So, the second quarter could be up 1.5 and the fourth quarter is all
###321 over 16.
###325 So, that's kind of exciting news at this point and along with 16,000
###329 cows that left the dairy industry here in February.
###333 Certainly, things are happening out there on the farm.
###337 We did mention briefly as we talked about surviving in these times,
###341 again in the U.S. this is your deficiency payments.
###344 Again, you know it only counts for your first 2.9 million pounds of milk
###348 but, in the February price it was 1.63
###351 If we look forward that prices almost going to be at 2 dollars in March.
###356 At least projections if you look at what's ahead
###359 that's what the tables are showing,
###361 1.93 in March a 1.60 in April.
###365 So anyway, that's another factor that'll come into play
###369 and certainly you know if you're doing a farmer here you
###372 usually want to be aware of this program, regardless of your herd size because it looks
###376 like that the next 2 or 3 months.
###377 What's the good news on this chart? It looks like in September
###381 numbers get very low which means
###383 the price of milk is coming up.
###385 Well what are we going to talk about then? I thought we just set the stage a little bit
###388 to get an idea about where the prices are,
###390 when they might change, what are some of the strategies,
###393 and of course being one of the question we would all like an answer from the three
###397 of us is: where can i find that 5 dollars per hundred-weight?
###401 More specifically: what changes can i make
###404 to save 5 dollars per hundred-weight? Unfortunately, there is one right answer
###407 there Jim, the answer is don't feed your cows.
###410 If you don't feed your cows you will save about 5 dollars
###414 per hundred-weight.
###415 I think there is some negative downside to that but at least they're sure academic
###418 answer you have.
###419 So, what I'm going to go through our these three points: feed benchmarking, the
###423 three golden rules, and then alternatives. Dave and Dick will come in
###428 and be players in that part of the program as well.
###431 Let's start going through what I call
###434 feed benchmarking.
###435 I put this up the same this to say from Illinois dairy days back in January
###439 and some focus meetings in February in Illinois. Farmers are making
###444 decision.
###445 Bankers are forcing farmers to make decisions. Farmers are asking nutritious
###449 and veterinarians to make changes well.
###451 All these are pretty scary,
###453 all these have been told,
###454 and the one that really scares me is two bankers have told their people
###458 you'll feed only what's on the farm. Which means
###461 corn
###461 and forages.
###463 That has some serious ramifications as well.
###466 Let's go look at this economic benchmark.
###469 We will go through this modestly fast but, every dairy farmer, every consultant,
###473 every individual
###476 has this type of a budget.
###478 This is illinois, we will be very clear at times that
###481 the data is very biased and
###483 specifically laid out but, this says pretty much today what is the cost but
###488 groceries in front of our girls.
###490 You can see we have broken down into six different categories. I go right up
###493 and say I'm going to pay someone 10 cents a cow
###496 to do that do the work. That may include balance rations,
###499 interpreting test results,
###501 maybe spotting good feed buys, and things like that.
###504 Here you can see here that magic 50 pounds of dry matter
###507 that is costing 4.44.
###510 Now, let's go to the next  one and this is the one you want to circle
###514 or go back to or write down quickly.
###516 Here's is where you are going to get your grades.
###518 See that top number? There is your 4.44.
###521 It then generates these next four benchmarks.
###523 The first one is feed cost per pound of dry matter and that is .09 cents. If you can feed cows
###528 for .09 per pound of dry matter here in the Midwest but
###531 when I was in Arizona about a month ago that is .02 cents higher.
###536 .02 cents of dry matter per pound higher.
###538 Well those folks are now looking at another extra dollar in their
###542 feed cost but, luckily we hear in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa don't face that
###547 as far as that goes.
###547 So, .09 cents becomes a aid.
###550 Feed cost per hundred-weight of milk notice that sits somewhere around 6 to
###553 6.50 to 7 dollars.
###556 What do you have to see?
###557 You have to see those cows that produce more milk in the same feed stuff
###562 produces cheaper. So, anytime you start messing with milk yield then be well
###567 aware you're gonna start
###568 playing the game of losing some of these benchmark numbers.
###572 I'm saying if you can't feed your cows 6.50 per hundred-weight here in the
###575 Midwest you're doing a very nice job.
###577 If you get it down below 6 dollars more power to you.
###582 Income over feed cost
###583 actually gets outdated everyday
###586 and some people love this figure.
###589 I don't use it very much because I can't control the price of
###593 my milk.
###594 That drives this number. I mean a year ago this number looked a lot
###597 better and you as a producer had nothing to impact.
###601 You do impact feed cost per amount of dry matter, feed cost per weight of milk, and the last
###605 one feed efficiency.
###607 This one is getting lots traction now.
###609 Feed efficiency and suddenly dairy farmers are interested.
###612 Consultants are interested saying, maybe that's important to know how much milk
###616 do I get from each pound of dry matter.
###617 Your aim
###618 is 1.5.
###619 If you get your feed efficiency over 1.5
###622 you're doing an awfully good job. You are doing a really job.
###626 Why is that important?
###627 All I did was take a cow,
###630 a herd,
###631 a string of cows producing 70 pounds of milk
###634 at .09 cents a pounds of dry matter.
###636 If I can support that 70 pounds of milk with 50 pounds of dry matter
###640 versus 44 pounds of dry matter that's a savings of .56 cents a cow per day.
###646 A huge number, that's a huge number.
###649 I would argue if you are in a room and lectured with me in class or
###654 at a conference
###655 all of us should be able to find .50 cents a day
###658 and if after this seminar is over and you have not found .50 cents
###661 then Dave Fisher, Dick Wallace, and Mike Hutjens haven't done a very good job.
###665 bIwould argue all of you should be able to get some worth
###668 between 1.5 and 1.6 by doing some rather interesting
###671 strategic thing
###673 that we will touch on here very briefly.
###675 So, that's a powerful power point where feed efficiency is this critical,
###679 critical number.
###680 Now, if you don't think it varies, it is a very busy slide, in fact  Jim Anders put
###684 this slide together.
###685 I just shows about 67 different farms here in Illinois collected
###689 in January
###690 of 2009.
###691 Guys and gals these are pretty good farms.
###693 Notice the yellow number that's the low ball number and
###697 the blue number is the high number.
###699 Just look at the differences on the bottom 3 numbers
###703 on feed cost. We see some herds here on feed costs getting down
###707 as low as 1.41 so, that's a high group TMR.
###711 Now notice that is also the most expensive cost of pound per dry matter.
###714 Don't you miss that!
###716 In other words, this dairyman has gotten a
###718 very good ration put together
###720 very expensive ratio. His cows understand that
###723 and so they respond very well. There's a low group versus a high group.
###727 We will touch on that very briefly and remember this slide.
###730 Look at this slide over here on feed efficiency.
###731 One of my herds is 1.4,
###733 most of my herds are sitting around 1.51-1.61.
###738 This shows us, all of these herds are in Illinois, that in most cases almost are literally
###742 within a 20
###743 to 30 mile radius of where our meeting was being held
###746 over at Freeport. So it is some amazing data.
###750 So, let's look at the bottom line as we finish up here
###753 and this comes from Bruce Jones, Doctor Bruce Jones, at the University of
###756 Wisconsin Madison and this came out of one of its publication several months
###760 ago he said
###760 here are 3 of the big items.
###762 He's got feed cost in a range.
###765 most of my Illinois guys are going to be on the right side.
###768 I've got an Illinois herd, probably going to be the left side, he's milking
###771 either 1,200 or 3,000 cows so,  certainly
###775 it makes a difference. Feed cost,
###777 non-feed cost,
###778 labor costs, in fact Dave Fisher
###780 and a colleague down in his area other, work with these numbers and
###784 they come out almost identically coming at a little different direction.
###788 The point simply is that notice that top-line:
###790 no debt payment,
###791 no return on assets, no return management skills or salary
###795 but, simply says we probably need in Illinois somewhere between
###799 15.50 for milk
###799 to cover everything
###801 You can see some of the other farms can get around
###803 11:50 to 12 dollars because they can survive at least covering these costs
###807 as well.
###808 So, that's another question that has been raised by some of our students and that is
###811 well where do we have to be to cover costs?
###814 That's why I'm pretty excited this morning to see that actually you could lock in
###818 16 dollar milk
###819 for the last three months of
###822 of of this year
###823 and of course you can actually contract your milk. Now question is are you going to do
###826 that?
###827 That's another question for another story and
###829 we can do that for a Q&A.
###832 Okay, that part care of takes care of the first third of the
###835 presentation.
###836 Something what I call benchmarks numbers comparisons
###839 how competitive are you, what do you have to have and where is your profit margin
###844 going to start to occur?
###846 I'm not going to my second part and every time you see these jersey cows
###849 it simply says were changing a topic
###852 or an emphasis to try to keep you with me as we go through the webinar.
###857 Webinars are deadly and
###858 they can be really tough
###859 because there's no way to see faces
###862 and see what people are saying like what is this guy talking about?!
###865 So, let's go to through these golden rules and we'll go through them modestly fast.  If you read
###869 a couple of farm magazines these have been picked up
###872 a couple of different sources. These are golden rules that simply state
###875 number one:
###876 I'd never give up milk
###878 and if you are a banker get your ears on.
###880 If you're a consultant get your ears on.
###883 If you're dairy farmer having a hard time paying bills
###885 you've just gotta live with that.
###887 The reason is that I bring up this point now a useful guideline and
###892 it simply says if we look at dry matter, that means
###895 grocery that feed the cow,
###896 versus what she produces in milk sales. The thumb for for Jersey's is
###900 2 pounds of milk per pound of dry matter.
###903 Actually Holstein's is about 2.5 but let's just say to because it's easy
###906 to see.
###907 So, most dairy cows should give you that extra pound of dry matter
###911 or that pound of dry matter you takeaway that's going to cost you 2 pounds milk.
###915 So, if milk is sitting at 12 dollars
###918 and we're looking at 2to 1 ratio it simply says I'm going to put .09 cents
###921 in front of my Jersey cow, it says I would be getting .24 cents back
###926 or .30cents back.
###928 I'm simply saying that's an offly nice trade.
###930 That's awfully good trade. I have to be very, very, very careful
###934 when I start pulling back because that's going to mess with milk yield and milk performance
###939 as far as that goes. Now the next line simply says yes let's do some shopping!
###944 Here are 3 different energy sources
###946 and will be calculated out with the cost per Mcal of energy.
###950 It could be a pound of TVM whichever numbers you like to work with.
###955 If you are in
###955 France it would be metabolizable energy, it depends
###960 on what country you are in
###961 and what system you are working with but at the point it is very simple.
###963 You can see those numbers and the answer is the cheapest source of energy
###968 on these feeds would be corn silage. Now, recently there's a new winner in Illinois and
###973 its called wet gluten feed.
###975 We're seeing prices
###977 of gluten feed somewhere around 60 dollars a ton
###980 and gluten feed is a tremendously, tremendously good energy source.
###986 So, yes I would say don't cut back and energies.
###988 The question is are you buying the best economical source of energy. The same thing
###992 would apply to forages, applied to protein supplements, and apply to
###995 byproduct feeds.
###997 The question is
###998 don't cut down on nutrients but are you getting
###1000 the best bang for your dollar.
###1003 Golden Rule number 2
###1005 follows the rule number one and it simply says
###1008 that most of us, unless you're living in Florida or Georgia or some of those
###1011 other milk markets, we are paid on pounds of components.
###1015 This is a fairly sobering and you'll notice that just about a year ago
###1019 at this time, by the way that's 2009,
###1029 milk fat was, thats the last numbers i have since the March numbers aren't out,
###1034 a 1.09 for milk bath
###1036 and that should be 1.92.
###1043 That protein prices should be at 1.92, a 1.92 out side of that it looks
###1048 really good. Of course that milk price is around 12 dollars outside of
###1052 that all those numbers look pretty good. I just want make sure people are top of things
###1055 here.
###1059 components have value
###1061 and that's another number to take a look. So rather than dwell on these
###1064 wonderful numbers,
###1066 James is rapidly making corrections here, let's look at and simply say well are
###1069 you getting your cows to get their genetic potential out of them?
###1074 This comes out Hoards Dairyman every year they put their DHIR and these are
###1078 the
###1079 basically registered breeders
###1082 here in United States. They get these rather exact high-tech
###1086 records
###1087 and basically what it says that if I have Holstein cows in the United States
###1091 these cows on DHIR tests in the United States average about a
###1096 3.6 to 3.7
###1097 The true protein, those of you who are in Canada,
###1100 you've gotta put 2/10ths on top of that,
###1102 most of you in China have to put 2/10ths on top of it and in Europe you have to add 2/10ths to that
###1106 because what we're reporting the U.S.
###1108 is true protein
###1110 because that's what drives cheese yield.
###1112 So, we're not paying you for NPN
###1114 and that's why I'd be a little bit careful to who don't live in the U.S.
###1117 your numbers are going to be put at 2/10ths point higher we have on the screen here.
###1122 The point is that if I have Holstein cows and they're giving me a 2.8
###1126 true protein test
###1127 than we would ask you to leave some money on the table.
###1130 Why are your Holstein cows not producing components? Because we just saw on the last slide
###1135 those components have value
###1137 and we've got to get those corrected out there as well.
###1140 The third golden rule is one that really scares me.
###1143 Of all the ones I have seen,
###1145 this is the one that's causing me the most concern
###1148 and that is long-term.
###1150 Long-term make people say well you know I've gotta get July.
###1154 So, I'm not going to use AI, I'm not going to use my consultant, and I'm not
###1158 going to use the the veterinarian. Let's go to the nutrition side and simply says
###1162 your long-term if you're going to be out of the dairy business in
###1165 2 to 3 months then
###1166 you can do anything you want
###1168 but, if you're going to back it a webinar year from now with us
###1171 than I'm simply saying certainly we've got to get animals calving.
###1175 So when we start pulling out minerals and vitamins from the heifers
###1178 we are going to slow down in growth
###1180 and you can see what that cost is. Now the good news is
###1183 you don't pay that all your checkbook but, the problem is
###1186 2 years from now those heifers are not going to be there.
###1189 Accelerated calf program
###1191 have some controversy on this point but, the Drackley work and  the New York work
###1195 indicate about 1,000 pounds more milk
###1197 because of the accelerated high-protein diets feed
###1200 in the first 5 or 6 weeks. That's going to cost you 50 dollars and
###1204 that is you're problem. I'm going to have to pay 50 dollars in March
###1208 to recoup something from way back 2 years from now that may give me a 1,000
###1212 pounds more milk that's to be worth
###1214 a 110 dollars or to make more life simple hopefully even
###1218 more than that. Dave Fisher will talk more about this
###1221 in his webinar in a couple of weeks,
###1224 Getting cows pregnant, this is in Wisconsin that
###1227 open days are anything more than 120 days or 2 dollars a day
###1231 they say are over 200 days that is 8 dollars
###1235 So, there is a curvilinear response that says the longer these cows
###1238 are not pregnant
###1239 the more money you lose because they don't come in as fresh cows.
###1242 Wisconsin's somatic cell count
###1244 and of course from California lame cows. So, if you are not hoof trimming or
###1248 you are not paying attention to
###1249 those kinds of things,
###1250 another 6 pounds of milk again you never see that running down the
###1254 milking parlor it is just that the cow
###1258 doesn't produce.
###1259 These are scary ones because people are
###1263 really jeopardizing long-term impactors.
###1266 So, the point is if you make a change today or last week or last month
###1271 than the cows are going to respond these are all different types of cow
###1275 responses that you and I might see out there. Milk Urea Nitrogen,
###1279 if it changes by more than 3 units, I will read the first one
###1282 the rest can read yourself but, it simply says if your MUNS has changed by
###1286 2 to 3 units.
###1288 than something has happened in the cow.
###1290 So, in the normal range I expect to see the MUN to be somewhere between 8 and 12.
###1294 So, you elect to pull out something out of your diet and the MUNs go up to 14.
###1300 Wow, something has happened
###1301 in the cow in other words, the cows are telling you whatever you did
###1305 it has impacted
###1307 her utilization of protein
###1309 in the diet.
###1310 That applies to all those other factors listed on your screen here today
###1314 as well and we in fact already covered the bottom 3.
###1317 in some other golden rule.
###1319 Cows always talk and cows responds.
###1322 Keep your eyes wide open and listen to them because they will probably give you
###1325 some feedback as well.
###1328 Now we are moving on to the last page and we are in  pretty good shape time wise actually
###1333 of the last phase of this. What are some things that we should be thinking
###1336 about
###1337 and talking about once we have said I'm not going to violate the golden rules.
###1341 I understand there are some economic benchmarks on the feed side that we have to be aware of.
###1345 I understand the price of milk, at least in the U.S., looks like it's coming back up
###1349 which it is for this Friday at this stage of the game.
###1352 What are some things we can look at the that we can cheat?
###1355 I'm going to cheat it's been a really tough 2 months
###1359 for those of us in extension because
###1360 farmers are saying "Mike, I just can't pay the bills anymore.
###1364 I've got have got to make some adjustments."
###1367 Here we go, we are going to let you do some cheating but be careful to not violate my golden rules!
###1371 We are going to look at starch.
###1372 and we've got one power point on most of these and Dave will come back on forage
###1376 quality a bit later.
###1378 We learned some lessons a year ago with 7 dollar a bushel of corn.
###1382 We discovered we don't have to feed 30 percent starches because there are some other
###1385 strategies out there
###1386 as listed here.
###1387 Rumensin, reducing fecal starch losses,
###1390 looking at rumen fermentable carbohydrates and byproduct feeds.
###1394 So, we are saying all of you with this line should know it pretty much what is your
###1397 starch levels in your feeding programs.
###1400 The low number 19 comes from a minor institute
###1402 and they've actually
###1404 cranked this number down but using higher levels of corn silage and other unique feed stuffs
###1408 to get that job done.
###1410 We are saying you don't need to be at 30, 31, 32, or 33 percent starch.
###1413 So, maybe there's an opportunity to reduce some of that input
###1417 cost as far as that goes.
###1419 Let's go to the next power point and then say well is corn really working for
###1423 you?
###1424 This data simply says how you've processed corn
###1427 and i know we have one company online here today that has steam flaked corn.
###1431 You can see that has a higher energy value
###1434 than say a cracked corn.
###1436 Some of you online have high moisture corn
###1439 and that will feed
###1440 hotter than dried corn assuming that it is at least 26 percent
###1444 moisture.
###1446 So, you can see in orange, that was because Illinois won their
###1449 basketball game last night and
###1450 they did not. So, Jim I think we should have put it all in black today
###1454 but anyway
###1454 it will help you read.
###1456 But the point simply says is that corn
###1459 how you process it, how you handle it
###1461 how you make it makes real difference. Now for a dairy farmer if you
###1465 look at some work from Penn State
###1467 and from Farmland Industries
###1468 the difference between the top corn and the bottom corn in a mid-lactation cows
###1472 is 6 pounds
###1473 of milk.
###1475 So I can support 6 pounds more milk because you and I have processed
###1480 corn
###1481 to make the starch more available
###1483 in the rumen of to a maximize/optimize rumen fermentation and microbial growth.
###1488 That's a take-home message. Now some of you are saying, well I grind my corn
###1493 on the farm.
###1494 Here's your action,
###1495 sneak out after the seminars or don't let your wife or spouse catch you
###1500 and take a cup corn and put it through your flour sifter
###1503 and see how much goes through your flour sifter if it's dried corn.
###1507 2/3s of it should go through the flour sifter.
###1509 Now you can also send samples to a commercial lab and get you the exact number listed on
###1513 this slide
###1514 but these are some things you can consider and look at out there on
###1518 your dairy farm.
###1520 Another one is to make sure we process corn silage properly.
###1523 This is some work done by Joe Harrision and he looked at all the published
###1527 studies and there are two or three take-home messages.
###1530 Published studies means that
###1532 good research
###1534 in a journal of the dairy science or animal science. Notice a response there is
###1538 around 2 pounds
###1539 of 3.5 fat corrected milk
###1542 because generally speaking butter fat test was higher and we saw some more milk.
###1546 But look up there he noticed under that 1.1 pounds of milk
###1550 there's a minus
###1551 and there's a plus. Obviously,
###1553 some corn was processed
###1554 more optimally or correctly than others. So the answers did you do it right?
###1559 We're basically saying
###1560 I don't need to see the kernels,
###1562 I'd like now to crack them
###1565 and hammer those dudes
###1566 so i get rid of the kernel
###1568 and expose that starch here in the rumen of the animal
###1571 and the small intestine.
###1573 You will see some other advantages as well. So the question is:
###1576 have you looked at your corn silage? Have you seen kernels in them? Do you have a
###1580 3/4 inch theoretical length of chop to maintain good rumen mass
###1584 and goo rumen function? So, just because we process corn
###1587 doesn't we've got it done right.
###1589 Now there's nothing I can do about that here in February and March but
###1593 that's a take home message.
###1595 Another one is rumensin, lets look at the bottom one.
###1599 300 milligrams of rumensin replaces about a 1 to 1.5 a pounds
###1603 of corn.
###1604 That rumensin will cost you 2 to 3 cents. So there is not that many places in the United Stages
###1608 where you can buy corn for 2 to 3 cents. There is no way you are going to get there.
###1612 So there's another strategy according to Hoard's Dairyman
###1615 survey in 2008 about 22% of our farmers
###1618 reported
###1619 they were feeding rumensin.
###1621 There sits an opportunity. Now look at the levels we can feed.
###1626 You can see it can vary anywhere from about a
###1629 120 milligrams to 660. So,certainly you have to ask, do I have the
###1633 optimal level?
###1633 And you and I are probably going to monitor such things as manure consistency
###1637 and butter fat test
###1638 to try to get a handle on that.
###1640 Dick Wallace told me here at the University of Illinois
###1642 yesterdays class working about 325.
###1645 We're like everybody else we start at 275 to 280
###1648 and Dick has raised that up gradually because they're cows appear to handle
###1652 the higher levels of rumensin and because the response in terms of
###1655 feed efficiency
###1656 impact is linear.
###1658 The longest the the rumen can handle those higher levels of rumensin
###1662 or monensine
###1663 whichever name you want to use.
###1665 Another one is to steal some of that starch out of the manure.
###1669 This is the form from Jim Ferguson's lab at the University of Pennsylvania
###1673 This represents about 18 or 20 herds about 75 groups
###1677 of cows. I've talked to Jim about couple months ago and he said they've expanded
###1681 this and what you see here is how much starch there is in the manure.
###1685 All your commercial labs are 13 to 15dollars
###1688 can't calculate, excuse me, can't measure fecal starches and on the right (vertical axis)
###1693 you are going to see what is called apparent digestibility of starch. So, that
###1698 point 8 is 80 percent utilization,
###1700 point 9 is 90 percent utilization to 100 which  means of all the starch
###1704 there is theoretically  going to be consumed.
###1710 There's always going to be some starch that gets through for various reasons
###1713 because of a biological system
###1715 of the cow and her rates of passage digestive track.
###1718 But look at this guys and gals
###1720 some of these groups of cows are at 8 percent to 10 percent
###1724 starch.
###1725 Dave Lighty at Illinois did a study on this
###1727 for me last summer and the range in Illinois 4 and 10 percent.
###1731 So the question is: so what?
###1733 And the so-what answer sits right here. The two trouble items.
###1736 Let's take the second one first, if you can reduce fecal starch to by one unit
###1741 in other words from
###1742 6 percent to 5 percent or
###1743 9 percent to 8 percent. Jim Ferguson and said
###1746 that represents about 7/10s of a pound of milk.
###1749 I think it's a pretty good idea. I would take
###1752 starch out if the  which I don't get paid for and at letting the cow make
###1755 milk out of it.  Sound like a no-brainer to me at this stage of the game.
###1759 Notice he also said that we should be at least at 90 percent starch
###1763 digestibility
###1764 which means you should be something less than 5.
###1767 Dave Fisher knows some of these herds. I think we had 3 or
###1770 4 hers out of 19 that  met this criteria.
###1774 So as we would say there are opportunities and again
###1777 I'm not charging you
###1778 more cost perhaps to get this done.
###1782 Then we going to go to the next one,
###1784 feed additives and let me tell you these are being jerked out  a mile a minute.
###1788 So what I did was to put together two lists.
###1791 The first one is what I call and no brainer.
###1794 These were questions at our focus group and says well Hutjens
###1798 I'm only going pick one or two but I can't buy all of them.
###1801 So these are my magic ones, in fact Dick Wallace's class actually ranked these
###1806 yesterday. The number one was rumensin and I'll tell you the best students got it right.
###1810 So my view, I'm going to rank these for you, I would put rumensin number one.
###1815 i think probably put silage inoculants number two.
###1819 That is going to be a tough one because
###1821 you don't sell corn silage you only reap that advantage and
###1825 decide once you feed it.
###1826 Rumen buffers and yeast cultures as three and four.  Organic trace minerals and then Biotin.
###1832 That's how
###1833 I would rank them out.
###1834 We can spend a whole seminar or webinar I guess I should of this
###1838 whole list.
###1839 And If you are interested, Jim is going to survey you if you want to do that sometime in the
###1842 future, we'd love to come back and do a webinar on feed additives:
###1846 which one, how much, and why we can use it.
###1849 Now I also have a second list here and notice the name change on this it says additives as
###1854 needed.
###1855 So these are ones that I'm saying are specially need. What do I mean by that?
###1859 Well for example if I've got body condition score three seven five cows,
###1863 little pud suckers,
###1864 then rumen protected niacin right into the diet.
###1868 If i have to have fatty liver diagnosed by my veterinarian with lots of
###1871 ketosis then lots of rumen protective choline
###1874 would come into place.
###1875 If I'm going to drench cows at calving to try to get blood glucose levels up to
###1879 reduce ketoine production
###1881 then propylene glycol becomes a very favorite product. If I'm going to be
###1885 finding molds in my feed stuffs
###1887 mycotoxin binder can be very effective product as far as that goes.
###1892 In July my feed get hot in the bunk
###1893 I may out an acid in this case a probionic di-acetate acetate
###1897 preservative in with my feed to keep from it from getting hot
###1900 so the cows will eat more of it. So these are as needed. You may need to them in summer,
###1904 may need them for fresh cows,
###1907 for fat cows,
###1908 and you try it target them because i'm not sure i can justify selling
###1911 it to you for every cow
###1913 in your herd
###1914 let's say on the
###1916 20th of March.
###1918 The next Jersey cow pops up and says well okay we've talked
###1925 What about by-products?
###1927 Now this is Illinois again so be very careful and I'm looking at my list of people from
###1931 all over at this stage of the game.
###1933 Here we can see
###1934 a list and let me tell you what I've done and then you know what which read
###1938 it.
###1938 Again, Jim Baltz is also showing where you can find this. These are all loaded
###1942 online and Jim will come back and show that at the end of the seminar when the Q&A
###1946 period but, let's just read this
###1948 let's pick on the bottom one: distillers grains. That's the hot one.
###1952 Distillers grains is in yellow which means in Illinois that's a good buy.
###1956 The next column or in the next one it says 10 to 15 percent of the ration
###1960 dry matter.
###1961 So, the cows are eating 50 pounds of dry and you can add 5 to 7.5 pounds of
###1966 dried distillers grains or wet distillers grains dry matter equivalent.
###1971 Now the question is why is that ranged
###1973 and the answer is
###1974 the oils
###1975 you have in the distillers grains.
###1976 If you have under 12 percent oil
###1978 then you can go higher because that oil tends to be a risk factor in high producing
###1982 dairy cow rations.
###1985 If its a low oil, I go that backwards.
###1986 If it's a high oil I can only go 10 percent if it's a low oil
###1990 I can go as high as 15 percent. Dakota Gold some of you in the Midwest
###1994 will recognize that name.
###1995 Dakota Gold is probably the cadillac
###1998 in distillers grains.
###1999 They control the amino acid profile,
###2001 they control of the variability, they control the oil, so it becomes a
###2005 very good product.
###2006 Got to pay a little more for it usually but by the large you can push a little higher
###2009 level.
###2010 Then in yellow down there, fighting in the yellow down there, we ran this
###2014 through Feed Valve. Feed Valve 3 developed by University of Wisconsin.
###2017 Some of you out there may use Sesame that's the Ohio State's program.
###2021 The break even price 2.98 a ton.
###2023 The price that we saw and that this was a month ago 1.62. Now low and behold,
###2028 I just got my cheat sheet in here, that came in the mail this morning, here
###2032 in the eastern corn belt and Iowa
###2035 1.15 to 1.25 a ton.
###2038 Wow, they are almost giving this stuff away.
###2040 So, it simply says at this time of tight economics
###2043 distillers grains, wet brewers and of course you have got to be living fairly close to
###2047 Saint Louis at least in Illinois or close to Milwaukee
###2049 or close to Lacrosse your in the middle parts of the state.
###2052 They are a very good buy. You are not going to carry water very far
###2056 because the price o diesel and gas has gone back up.
###2058 Corn gluten feed a
###2060 very good price
###2061 and that price I've seen now drop down to 100 dollars. In fact, from
###2065 one of our shippers here in Illinois, you could lock in
###2069 through August
###2070 85 dollars.
###2072 85  dollars a ton and now the is FOB and you still have to get it to your farm
###2075 but, there's some real opportunities out there.
###2077 Fuzzy cottonseed
###2079 the newest price I just got in basically in Wisconsin,
###2083 Minnesota, and northern Iowa
###2086 2.40 a ton.
###2087 So, you can see while they're not giving the stuff away it's a
###2091 pretty good deal. Southern Illinois, Dave at one of our focus groups, we had just a
###2095 week ago
###2095 we had 2.14
###2098 delivered in.
###2099 Wow.
###2099 I know Dr. Wallace you've been looking at that as well.
###2102 So again, here's another opportunity to look at and are using some of these,
###2105 what I call very
###2107 very competitive,
###2108 nutrition sources out there in your feeding program.
###2111 Well let's look at another one, this is called weigh back. Weigh backs is what the
###2115 cow doesn't eat.
###2117 Shrink something that blows away, what the birds eats, the rains spoils, or whatever the
###2121 case is going to be.
###2123 Well here's a huge huge list.
###2125 Huge list.
###2126 I'm only going to pick out about two of  these.
###2129 The first one is the big one.
###2131 Historically, we have recommended 2 to 4 percent weigh back.
###2134 Basically, were saying get that down below 2 percent
###2138 and if you are a
###2140 really good
###2141 feed bunk manager go to the empty bunk.
###2144 Dick mentioned yesterday in class that here at the University of Illinois,
###2148 in a group of 100 cows,
###2150 they are taking away 50 pounds of wet feed
###2153 total from other cows.
###2155 That means that they have got about 2 pounds
###2158 excuse me a .5 pound of weigh back,
###2161 a .5  pound of weigh  back and that's less than a .25 of a
###2165 pound.
###2166 So basically,  they are almost at 0
###2168 but, what are they doing?
###2169 Fresh feeds when they com out of the parlor. They're not running out of feed until
###2172 about 20 minutes to a half hour before they're going to the parlor.
###2175 So, they're really managing the bunk.
###2177 Second bullet point says if you are over 4 to 5 percent
###2181 you can't feed it to steers,
###2185 You've got to go back to cows with it.
###2188 For example, Fair Oaks several years ago Dr. Gordon Jones said
###2193 they feed  to a 7 percent weigh back in their high string. They pick up their
###2197 weigh back and then use that as an ingredient in their low cow string.
###2201 They don't sort so there is lots of weigh back in there and it's a very pretty
###2205 predictable product and almost predictable as
###2208 corn silage
###2209 or soy bean meal or any other ingredient you might have on the farm.
###2212 Then they feed that to an almost empty bunk.
###2214 So, you know that's the strategy as well.
###2216 Make sure sure the cows do not sort it and
###2219 make sure you clean out the bunks. There are all these tricks of traded that say
###2222 you want to manage weigh back but we've changed our number.
###2226 We'd say 2 to 4 is good.
###2227 Back at the University of Illinois, Dr. Wallace manages our herd and they have
###2231 to feed to a 10 percent weigh back because that's what it's called ad lib, ad lib
###2235 free choice all the cow can eat.
###2237 So basically, now what they're doing it how do we manipulate that to try to
###2241 reduce that in the non-research cows.
###2244 Another one is the one group versus the multiple TMR
###2247 and we have changed our answer.
###2249 Let's look at an example and then we will discuss that.
###2252 What I did was I went to Spartan 2.
###2254 This is the least cost computer program out of Michigan State.
###2258 I looked at 2 different rations. I look at an 80 pound TMR
###2262 and a 60 pound TMR and said
###2264 what's the trade-off here guys and gals?
###2266 The 80 pound TMR
###2268 there is no
###2269 there is omega lakin here, there's no additives in here, there is no bypass protein here. It is
###2273 corn,
###2274 corn silage, soybean meal and alfalfa forage. Which could be haylage but
###2280 it does not make a difference since it is alfalfa forage. We put the prices in (the
###2283 typical prices). In fact, we will show you those prices here in just a few minutes
###2288 and you can see here
###2289 to feed 80 pounds of milk should take about 52 pounds
###2292 of dry matter. That cost is at 11.8 cents per pound of dry matter and costs
###2297 6.15 cents per cow.
###2299 This is very similar what we saw the earlier in our benchmarking.
###2302 The 60 pound TMR,
###2303 is down to 4.90.
###2305 Notice we are down to 45 pounds of dry matter and I've dropped a penny per pound
###2309 of dry matter off because I can use more forages in this feeding program.
###2313 Now remember I do not have any of those expensive additives or any other bells and whistles in here.
###2317 So, then I go to my next powerpoint and say okay
###2320 what's the savings. Just looking at the savings per cow per day: 1.25.
###2325 Holy smokers!
###2327 That's huge!
###2328 Huge.
###2330 Remember they are going to eat about 6.5 pounds less dry matter.
###2333 So, I'm go ing to take that away
###2335 because the cows won't eat as much of it.
###2336 Some take in 6.7 pounds of dry matter
###2339 away from that 1.25 and I was going to use a high TMR
###2343 because that what we are looking at and that's  about 80 cents a day.
###2346 So, that's the good news. They do not eat much so that helped me out.
###2349 There are still 45 to 46 cents laying on the table.
###2352 Now here comes your big question
###2354 and you talk about an argument out in Reno. This one was hot
###2357 and that says when I move a cow
###2360 from the high group to the low group
###2361 does she drop in milk
###2363 and if she does how much and how long.
###2366 Our university data shows a 2-pound drop.
###2369 This is some work done by Travis Michael who sent it to us.
###2373 Another research study says 5 or 6 pounds.
###2376 Another study says 2 to 4 percent.
###2378 So, you talk about a critical number because you can see if I drop 4 pounds
###2382 of milk when I switch those cows because they interact, they fight,
###2385 they eat less dry matter and they never come back.
###2388 When they don't come back
###2389 then that's going to cost me .40 cents.
###2391 So, my 1.25 that I saved
###2394 is down to .06 cents.
###2395 I'm down to .06 cents
###2397 but, I think I recommend that we look at multiple groups
###2400 because remember many of my fresh cows are gonna have some added fat,
###2404 they are going to have bypass protein in there, there are probably going to have some buffer in there,
###2408 going to have made this organic and trace minerals for reproduction,
###2411 some of you may have some POFA's
###2412 (some polyunsaturated fatty acids) for reproduction in there.
###2415 So, I'm saying we're gonna look at multiple groups
###2418 and we're looking like high and low,
###2420 thin cow and fat cow group, heifers,
###2424 to me if you have a heifer group
###2425 and a high group it is all the same. They are going to get the same ration in these
###2429 different groups but here comes the controversy. One farmer says,
###2432 well should I leave my mastitis group, my staff group and combine them with my clean cows?
###2436 I don't think I am going to do that.
###2438 So here sits a farmer because of
###2440 mastitis
###2441 or because of
###2443 reproduction in other words he has got a bull pen.
###2446 So, he said I got all my pregnant cows in one pen and the cows I want exposed
###2450 to the bull in another pen.
###2451 That we should pass on that one as well so that's not a very clean one
###2455 but some of you and i need to think about we look at one group versus two
###2458 groups as far as that goes.
###2459 My last power point is fats and oils and all we are simply saying it
###2463 you've got to make a decision.
###2465 You've got to make a decision when you're going to use it. I'm using
###2468 70 pounds
###2470 of 4 percent fat corrected milk. So, any cow that is giving me about
###2473 2/3 quarters pounds of milk fat I'm going to add oil.
###2476 Oils are expensive fuzzy cottonseed, soybeans, megalac, organic tallow,
###2482 or whatever you want to call it
###2483 they're there.
###2484 So, at some point I'm gonna add that and I'm gonna bring up about
###2488 5 to 5.5 percent of the ration.
###2489 I'm going to add to that 2 to 3 percent
###2491 from oilseeds or distillers grains first choice, animal fats my second
###2495 choice and my inert fats third choice. If you are feeding distillers grains extruded
###2499 soybeans a 1/2 a pound
###2501 of those fats and oils, i should say, or otherwise we can
###2504 bugger up the rumen as far as that goes. Then my strategies on
###2508 the rumen inert fats I would be like to make a lecture energy booster
###2511 100. I would use that as a add on to really improve reproduction,
###2515 reduced body weight loss,
###2517 to prevent ketosis and keep my cows
###2518 it pretty good health and shape at this stage of the game.
###2521 I go to my next power point and Dave Fisher,
###2524 I think we've got you turned on.
###2526 Dave Fisher from Edwardsville is going to cover these next couple of power points.
###2529 So, Dave I'll turn the program over to you.
###2532 Okay, thank you Dr. Mike and certainly I appreciate to visit about
###2537 the role of corn silage and forages
###2540 in the ration. We will go to our next slide
###2543 to begin the discussion. Certainly,
###2545 we often hear and
###2547 understand that forages are the foundation of the total dairy feeding program.
###2552 I suggest that corn silage should be the foundation
###2555 of that forage portion of the feeding program
###2558 and I say that because we you've seen many herds
###2562 work very well with
###2564 a high-level of corn silage in the diet. What level should it be?
###2568 I suggest that perhaps a ratio of 2/3's corn silage, 1/3 alfalfa
###2573 and on a dry matter basis
###2575 really fits well for high producing dairy cows because of the need for a high energy
###2579 fed
###2580 while still maintaining adequate fiber levels.
###2583 Matter of fact, I believe that Dr. Dick Wallace, who will come in later,
###2586 at the U of I herd has them at
###2589 2/3rd and 1/3rd.
###2591 The portion of corn silage to alfalfa also though will be influenced by other
###2596 feed stuffs or byproducts.
###2598 I think Mike that earlier in the discussion about
###2602 byproducts and how they could reduce the cost of of the ration. So
###2607 certainly again, we are going to take into consideration of byproducts in the diet
###2612 and
###2612 basing that on the quality of our harvested forages
###2616 we now
###2616 had a chance to to really build really neat ration.
###2620 In order to do that we have to be evaluate
###2623 the quality
###2624 and a lot of times people say well it looks good, it smells good, the cows are eating,
###2629 but they really do not have a good handle.
###2632 We suggest again that you
###2634 use some good tools.
###2636 The Newark test that came out a few years ago and
###2639 the NDF Digestibility test
###2641 is really is a great tool.
###2644 That helps to determine which forage or which specific variety will be
###2650 better it my ration to provide the needed energy to the diet. So, again
###2655 that NDF Digestibility that test and
###2658 many laboratories are doing that
###2660 and we'd like to see corn silage
###2662 greater than 57 percent
###2664 NDF Digestibility that is on a 48 hour test. We can talk more
###2668 about that in the unit we want to. Also, we look at different types of
###2674 varieties or different types of corn silages such as the role of
###2678 BMR, brown midrib. We'd like to suggest here again to we're looking
###2683 for high-quality forages in brown midrib corn silages.
###2688 Which brings that to the table because of the whole lignin,
###2690 high digestibility, and we can also get into the starch numbers and things of that
###2695 nature as well.
###2696 One thing that we always have to remember if we would and that is
###2700 strategic use of those forages,
###2703 by that I'm saying,
###2704 we really have to take a look at
###2707 how do we position those to the various animals that we'd feed. For example, heifer
###2712 verses dry cow high cow verses low cow
###2716 in the lactation.
###2718 My final point is that because of that forced position of
###2721 those feeds to meet the animal needs;
###2723 we really also need to understand
###2725 the importance position forages to meet the challenges
###2729 of lowering the feed cost
###2731 and here again corn silage
###2735 fits that role.
###2736 The next slide gives us a bit of a demonstration or a chance to make some assumptions
###2741 and compare
###2742 how forage costs will come out.
###2744 We're going to look at a 1350 pound Holstein cow
###2747 with 80 pounds of milk, in a positive energy state,
###2751 using alfalfa hay at 180 dollars a ton,
###2756 corn silage at 45 dollars a ton,
###2758 and you can read the
###2759 corn grain at 4.50 and
###2761 soybean meal 300.
###2763 Now, I understand that these prices will vary from place to place
###2767 but the point is those numbers
###2770 represent
###2771 was showing up now in the slide economics of the corn silage. We took
###2775 the Spartan 2 program to do a comparison of this corn silage at various
###2782 levels of the feeding program.
###2784 As we start to look at this and compare
###2787 it's pretty easy to see
###2789 as we'd increase corn silage in the diet
###2792 we decrease the total feed cost to the cow.
###2794 If we look at that the 0 on corn silage or all alfalfa hay diet it gets to be
###2800 the most costly and if we go to all corn silage and  no alfalfa diet
###2805 we can save about 1 dollar per cow per day
###2809 but, yet
###2809 in reality even though the Spartan program can do that in reality on the
###2814 farm you do not want to have a diet of all alfalfa or all corn silage.
###2819 We bring both together
###2821 and their again we start looking at should that be a 50/50,
###2824 80/20.
###2826 You need to make that decision as a dairy producer or nutritionist
###2832 but the point that we need to make here is
###2833 that corn silage is an excellent source of feed stuffs that will bring, as Mike
###2839 Mike Hutjens said earlier, the cheapest source of energy to the ration.
###2844 So we really want to use corn silage
###2846 as our foundation of the forage program and then bring in our good quality alfalfa
###2852 and then bring in out byproducts etcetera, etcetera, etcetera,
###2854 to cheapen up our ration as best we can.
###2856 Well, I skimmed over that pretty quickly and I think we can talk more about
###2860 this in the Q & A
###2861 if you want to.
###2862 I think if we bring up the next slide it will lead me into introducing my
###2866 colleague Dr. Dick Wallace our U of I Extension dairy veternarian who's going to
###2871 visit with on culling strategies, Dick.
###2874 Okay, thanks Dave. I don't have a lot to contribute
###2878 here except for this one slice. If you want to jump to the next slide.
###2881 It's probably good that Mike only has one slide for me today because of
###2885 my head cold and
###2886 I've been muted the whole time so I'm not coughing
###2889 through the entire seminar.
###2891 When were thinking about these marginal cows we need to
###2894 think about what we're gonna do moving cows out that are not profitable.
###2898 So, move them out of the herd out if she's not producing milk. You need to really
###2901 determine on a herd by herd basis what is the break even milk deal.
###2905 Is it 45 or 50 pounds?
###2907 What's your break even milk yield for cows in your herd.
###2911 Then you need to develop a strategy. Obviously, if the cow is pregnant you're probably going
###2915 to keep around.
###2916 Maybe what you need to do with that cow if she's down below say a 30 pound
###2920 level
###2921 is  to move her under some kind of a lower energy diet or even a non lactating diet and dry
###2925 her off.
###2926 Hopefully, she's not going to get too fat which leads to health problems later on
###2931 but certainly she still is a
###2932 valuable asset to the farm and potentially depending again on how long
###2936 it's going to be until she calves again.
###2938 It is really going to depend on how many holes you have in the herd.
###2941 If you have spots to put cows
###2944 verses if the herd is at maximum capacity from a parlor stand point.
###2948 Those are a lot of different strategies you need to think about that
###2951 certainly moving those those marginal cows out certainly is another
###2955 possible to think about. One of the things that were doing it university is
###2960 were basically feeding our cull cows
###2963 to increase their value
###2965 at a later time. So, we might be them from 30 to 60 days. Now,
###2969 Dr. Hutjens mentioned earlier that we need to be feeding that expensive
###2973 lactating cow weigh back
###2975 back to other cows.
###2977 Certainly, that is one strategy and you know there are some concerns
###2980 possibly about bio security and if there is any fecal contamination.
###2985 I don't know if we really want to be feeding that to other lactating cows from either
###2988 salmonella or johns disease or depending on what the
###2992 diseases are in the herd.
###2993 We take any weigh back that we have for me from the tie stall barns
###2998 or free stall barns as mentioned Travis has us feeding
###3001 down to
###3002 pretty much 0 weigh back in the free stall lots
###3005 but any weigh back that we might have been picking up we have been feeding our cull cows to
###3009 increase their value. We move them from a thin
###3013 yellow fat cow to a white fat cow
###3015 that's going to bring you maybe up to .05 cents more per pound
###3019 once she goes to slaughter.
###3020 So, just some strategies to think about
###3022 and I'm going to turn it over back to Dr. Mike.
###3026 Well thanks very much Dave and Dick. This wraps up the formal part of our
###3029 seminar.
###3030 Our summary looks pretty straight forward to me. I think if
###3034 you're going to be in this dairy business those 3 points we can't argue very
###3037 much about at this stage of the game and they are pretty
###3040 straight forward. Again, if you found value in this write this date down now. This
###3045 is our next webinar Dave Fischer will be leading on that. Both Dick and I will be online and
###3049 be part of that one as well. You can see the time and we are going to do it at noon.
###3053 I understand in China that's not a very good time but
###3056 that gentlemen has all he needs I think at this point.
###3059 There is the URL and you will be able to find that in other places as well.
###3062 We would certainly welcome your
###3065 involvement if you
###3066 have that time to sneak in for one hour as far as that goes.
###3070 We also welcome you to come to our website you can
###3073 go there as I said earlier the Dairy Net sites are excellent ones as well and
###3078 you can get to us from there
###3079 as well. We welcome you to come and visit those websites I think
###3083 there is really good information there for you.
###3086 So, at this time we welcome your questions! Jim we've got a couple of good ones
###3089 already here and any of you that want to type in a question.
###3093 I will go right ahead and Jim will monitor one as I will at this stage of the game. We
###3098 had a comment from an Illinois farmer who says, you know what
###3101 we can make all corn silage work very well. In fact I have
###3105 been on this farm and they are almost at 100 percent
###3108 corn silage on their farm and of course becomes very
###3112 economical as Dave pointed out. So, just a comment Dave that you do have one detracter
###3116 out there and you probably know who that crook is.
###3119 If not I will tell a little bit later.
###3122 We had a comment
###3124 that came in from a colleague in Pennsylvania who said,
###3128 Mike I haven't seen any data on finely ground corn is higher than
###3132 than high moisture corn
###3133 or steamed flaked and he questions that.
###3135 His point is well-taken and the good news is that I can to say blame it on
###3139 the NRC 1999 because I lifted those numbers
###3142 directly out of NRC. So, I think the point we have to make is that
###3147 if your high moisture corn is too dry,
###3149 if your steam flaking and it doesn't have the right density, if you're grinding your
###3152 corn is the right particle size you are going to lose some value.
###3155 My view is I think that by the finely ground corn, the steam flaked corn,
###3159 and the the high moisture corn are kissing cousins. If you really want to play
###3163 hardball
###3164 I think the real winner is steamed flaked corn. I say that not because of my
###3168 Pennsylvania colleague but basically because if you look at the data
###3171 that was done at Ag Way was not statistical. There's a little bit
###3175 more kick on on the protein site on the steam flaked corn.
###3180 We had another question it came up here bit earlier who said,  what about
###3184 this break even. The question is what do I mean by break even.
###3187 I'll answer in 2 or 3 ways and then Dave I'll let you in because you worked
###3191 with one of our
###3192 co ops on this one here. One break even simply said I'm just going to
###3196 cover my costs. I'm not looking at debt retirement or principle.
###3200 that looks to be around fifteen fifteen fifty or somewhere in that range there.
###3205 Most of us have debts
###3207 that number i've seen from FBM that number around 18 and 19
###3210 dollars here in Illinois. Then some of you want to make money on this thing and
###3215 that means you're going to be around 20.  In fact, if you look at USDA they
###3218 cut the corn belt break even pricing some where between 20 and 21 dollars
###3223 per hundred weight.
###3223 So, I think that all goes into play. So, one of my students said, Hutjens how do you get
###3228 away with that crap. I mean if you are getting 12 dollars from milk and
###3231 that's what looks like it's going to be
###3233 for February
###3234 here in Illinois and the minimal cost is 15 . The answers is  well
###3239 you don't make 3 dollars for labor. You know you don't pay yourself on that
###3243 or you have other ways to differ some of those costs
###3246 try to get that job
###3247 done as far as that goes.
###3249 Okay, Dave any comments on that?
###3252 Yes, I disagree. I think also then we're seeing actually paying
###3257 cash costs  and some of these
###3258 costs are for going at this time
###3261 when you only get the 12 dollar milk.
###3263 When we talk about that 5.15-50
###3266 cost-production
###3267 we do have that included in there certainly a value for the facilities, a value for
###3273 the cost of the cow but, we just do not have that return on investment or that
###3277 ability to pay
###3278 off debt etcetera like Mike said.
###3281 Well David, James thinks that I have screwed up answering that
###3284 question and I lead you astray as well. He's thinking that the the question
###3288 may relate  to that break even price on out byproduct feeds. That break even price on
###3293 byproduct feeds is based on
###3295 the 5 target ingredients.
###3296 We're using shelled corn as an energy source.
###3299 soybean meal as a source of protein and rumen undegradable protein,
###3302 we are using tallow as the price for fat or oil, we are using dicalcium phosphate as a
###3307 source phosphorus and using lime stone as a source of calcium. So, if you got a
###3311 byproduct feed like distillers grain that's high in phosphorous then it adds
###3315 value. Some of you in this line will say, Hutjens you are cheating because
###3318 a lot of that phosphorous and this is way too high already and that we have
###3321 some problems with environment about it.
###3322 Well, I'm sorry that's how the program works.
###3324 So, we are simply saying when you can get that feed delivered to your
###3328 farm at that price that's below break even than it's a better buy than
###3333 those 5 basing base ingredients. Norman Saint Pierre used a combination of feed stuffs.
###3337 So, instead of looking at an ingredient he is looking at the prices of hay and corn
###3341 silage and has a fairly,
###3343 I assume complicated,
###3345 system that says
###3346 then cottonseed then breaks even at a certain point but he's using feeds
###3351 while were using feed ingredients.
###3353 I there are a couple other private companies have some other internal
###3356 software program.
###3357 In fact, Spartan also does this in what they call shadow prices and
###3360 it will give you the same kind of thing as far as that goes.
###3363 David, do you want to make a comment here on a comment that says what
###3366 are the disadvantages of all core silage and basically 0 alfalfa diets?
###3372 WEll, I thin one of the  disadvantages would be that
###3375 corn silage  brings a low amount of proteins to the diet so
###3380 unless you can bring in that protein and a reduced cost or lower cost
###3385 in the form of by-products like you said corn distillers or whatever
###3390 unless you can do that then you have to stay with the  alfalfa because it
###3393 brings in that protein.
###3395 Advantage of course is that high energy
###3398 with processed corn silage
###3400 your able to maintain
###3402 good effective fiber and so as our Illinois dairyman mentioned he was
###3407 going all corn silage and that can be done. A lot of times I'd say
###3412 and 80-20
###3413 would certainly maybe play it well
###3415 because I like to have about 5 pounds of that longer
###3418 alfalfa scratch backer. Again,
###3421 I think the point is if you can balance that ration
###3425 with good economical byproducts to bring up my protein you can get bye with very little
###3430 alfalfa in the diet.
###3432 David great answer and I just wanted you to know that our colleague in Illinois
###3436 says, this is interesting, he knows 4.28
###3440 feed costs.  I assume that's per cow per day. Wow, that is a
###3444 really good number ands he's going to do really well. I don't think it's
###3448 per hundred weight but
###3448 respond back if it is. We had another quick question and I'll answer these quickly. I don't
###3452 know if other guys see them or is it just me? Well, I'm just seeing them.
###3455 Okay, here comes a question that says give me an example of an acid base bunker
###3459 extender. Well certainly the easiest one to go to is Camin, not that
###3463 I'm being paid
###3464 by Camin industry, but basically they have something
###3467 called bunk curb
###3468 Which is simply is a proprionic acid based additive
###3471 and for 6 or 8 cents you mix this into your TMR mixer. Its  got
###3475 prop in it and it retards the secondary fermentation. So, it tends to keep the
###3480 feed cooler for a longer period of time.
###3482 I've also seen another product that has di-acetate in it.
###3485 Which is an acetic acid type byproduct and that also seems to hold
###3489 back the secondary fermentation. Some of you guys will put that in the top of your
###3494 silos.
###3495 The top 10 feet of your silo, you'll put some proprionic acid in there because it
###3498 doesn't pack as well and you don't want that stuff to get moldy and get hot on
###3502 you as much. They'll treat the top
###3504 top 10 feet, the top 3 or 4 doors, of their silo to get that same thing done.
###3509 Question came in here,
###3511 do you have any comments or recommendations how to maintain rumen
###3514 health and function to prevent rumen acidosis
###3516 that can impact feed efficiency.
###3519 Boy,
###3520 this is the kitchen sink and
###3523 we may delay the full answer to that. We are simply saying if you have acidosis that
###3527 we are expecting the feed efficiency to .drop about a tenth of a point. I have
###3532 no research to back that up but it we know what does impact.
###3535 That means if you have acidosis probably thats 30 cents per cow per day range
###3539 is going to cost you.
###3540 We do that by such things like looking at fecal consistency, we look at
###3544 dry matter variation,
###3546 we look at lameness scoring on cows,
###3550 you could maybe use milk components in some cases butter fat but Wisconsin people argue
###3554 that's not a very sensitive test on that but, that's how I would try to do
###3558 that.
###3559 Then if you  have acidosis then comes the big laundry list such things
###3562 as,
###3563 Dave's already pointed out,
###3564 cud chewing,
###3566 such things as moisture of the ration, such things as grain levels, such
###3570 things a slugged feeding, such things as heat stress, and
###3574 all these things pop in
###3575 that can have some impact on rumen function and health.
###3578 I know that list was fairly short as far as that goes.
###3582 Got another quick question. We are burning through these offly fast. When I can't answer
###3585 one Dick and Dave I
###3586 will let you know. We have a question that's coming in
###3590 that is very specific.
###3593 It's a product that comes from Agri-King and we answer that it is called Rumimax
###3597 verses Rumensin. Rumensin is an antibiotic so it actually selects
###3601 against the gram-positive bacteria.
###3605 So, it's a microbial inhibiter that david that's how you
###3608 trained it yesterday at this point
###3610 so that's what we're men's and that's that's a blacks microbes and that meant
###3614 literally will decrease per pranic asset which has to be fishes he built into it
###3618 and integrity works against a four-day disconnect here is a small extent and
###3622 that's why sometimes you can see some impact
###3624 in room and help the relax product gives them of a combination of products out
###3629 there i'd think they have a they have some uh... direct that micro goes in
###3632 there i think this and he's culture in their i do not think they have ruins and
###3636 in their but then again i i'm not that close the private what one is more of
###3640 the room and stimulate pet product the other one is an antibiotic so that there
###3644 is there a vastly different
###3645 and if somebody wants to jump in on it on the max they can we can really backed
###3649 another quick question how much corn gluten kenya p animus court would
###3653 replace
###3654 my answer very simply as i gotta keep my targeted start level and if i say that's
###3658 twenty four percent
###3660 but island target twenty four percent starch and i've died and i will bring
###3663 inasmuch pollutants replace court as i can
###3666 to maintain that that that number about beating up like my colleague in illinois
###3670 heavy corn silage i'd probably to replace all my corner of corn gluten at
###3675 the stage gave because i've got started twenty eight thirty thirty two thirty
###3679 four percent starts coming from a corn silage so basically that's how i would
###3683 go analysis be simple about we simply say the formerly replaced after court
###3688 with corn gluten as a pretty safe thumb rel
###3690 you can replace the backlash that we're farmer in southern illinois i want him
###3694 is running out of course i was i think what corn gluten is a no brainer
###3698 and so i would suggest in many places all his corn silage with what corn
###3702 gluten feed assuming he can buy it
###3704 and its price for a t_v_ coastal resort audit again watch such things as
###3709 particle size because now corn silage is gone i'm losing some part of
###3713 the whole discussion be that here just a bit earlier and went on as far as i a
###3716 course
###3717 and um...
###3719 and uh... i just have a comment uh... oh
###3721 uh... where no question that can we feed a huge
###3724 quantity of corn side and summer day do you wanna read your spot that kenai
###3728 kid we feed a huge
###3730 amount of corn silage in the summer
###3734 years i don't think there will be a problem with that i think the key actor
###3737 shooter
###3739 pump life and make sure that uh... yeah fresh ito paris new york deep two or
###3744 three times as a person on tax day but certainly not the sport caledonian
###3749 intake it would be able to win
###3752 i would certainly
###3753 not be breaking boards monson coincides like any other thoughts
###3758 i die i figured that shade the only thing i would have to give it is that
###3761 the courts i think very high let yes it is all for my smokestack stabilizer
###3765 i think and get away maybe a little with a look at less risk of security mechanic
###3769 at all that lactic acid there's an it might even help will what scares me is
###3773 my farmer runs out of court sized at a temperature to be some degrees tomorrow
###3776 what a bad deal cut down picks up probably his most stabilizing ingredient
###3781 is diet and and and and i was replacing with something that that could be nearly
###3784 a stable with some in the front five six seven percent lactic acid as far as i a
###3789 course
###3790 we have two comments from to our people like this kind of fun actually they said
###3793 they're pretty confident now that that
###3795 kemon produce called t_m_ are saver instead of when i called moultrie
###3799 herb or or barker over something like that you can see i'm getting all i'm not
###3802 staying up today but i got that from two different people
###3804 and new hampshire has the same functions as far as that goes had another quick
###3808 question came in here about that
###3810 way arm
###3812 jemison uh... ways cheap how much we can it be to pay for child
###3815 can it be ad lib their market will need to be a
###3818 our number is that you could probably speed
###3821 uh... wing is going to be chevrons on the back in a two-way we say you can't
###3824 be probably about a camp out of town have sugar to the rational way out
###3829 lactose bob's going to be a sugar replacement as far as that goes so i'm
###3833 saying if you start adding about five percent five percent
###3838 that's a bunch that's mug shots
###3841 i would add more like two four percent
###3843 two to four percent on a dry matter pace too mighty ammar spark that caused it'll
###3848 go very very quickly could lead to be a if i had to pass a bill says iraq amazed
###3853 to know if i ruined with with baby dead point to fill factor and i drop it some
###3857 really fast real carbohydrate um... meyer of processes question he ap i i
###3862 think it could cost them ph
###3863 just because of the weapon this
###3865 of the fermentation profile so i have the room another aaj and it's kinda like
###3869 say well contract the eggs too much corvette club the d_a_ well academically
###3874 dole but if it's the wrong situation you better believe it supposedly a saving
###3877 what the hell it will with the wayside take two to four percent by the way of
###3881 ways cheap and and it is getting quite a bit cheaper then i would go him and look
###3886 at that also has a great additive for my image
###3889 if you want to put a_t_f_ nutrients are said to him to make it really for men a
###3893 larger you're not doing are at about ten percent
###3897 way dried weight to or even liquid way and holy smoker those bacteria think
###3902 they'd i'd like to have it because they got all that sugar in their te llamo
###3905 like might you be and many of the spark that caused
###3907 our colleague espy deny levels all bar court here in illinois came back and
###3912 said
###3912 he speedy about uh... four pounds uh... if we don't eat four pounds of corn he
###3918 says
###3919 the man or starz a stepping up so he set he can't replace all his core but
###3923 obviously
###3924 that's a lot less than camp over fourteen pounds at many farmers would
###3927 feed
###3928 at this point
###3929 another quick question came in here and i don't want reading racism ego takeoff
###3934 assign office park that caused canyon venad dry corn gluten feed along with
