0:0:0,22 --> 0:0:0,59
STEVE SPANGLER: Hi.


3
0:0:0,59 --> 0:0:1,2
I'm Steve Spangler.


4
0:0:1,2 --> 0:0:3,17
You know, some of the activities
in this episode are


5
0:0:3,17 --> 0:0:4,7
intended for you
to try at home.


6
0:0:4,7 --> 0:0:6,73
And others are completely
off-limits.


7
0:0:6,73 --> 0:0:9,76
So to tell you which ones you're
allowed to try and


8
0:0:9,76 --> 0:0:11,51
which ones you can't, we're
going to put a little note on


9
0:0:11,51 --> 0:0:13,78
the screen that says
"try this at home."


10
0:0:13,78 --> 0:0:16,36
If you do try it at home, just
let me say you probably need


11
0:0:16,36 --> 0:0:17,23
some safety equipment.


12
0:0:17,23 --> 0:0:22,25
So I always recommend these
super thermonuclear warfare


13
0:0:22,25 --> 0:0:23,85
gloves, because this
will protect your


14
0:0:23,85 --> 0:0:25,34
hands at all times.


15
0:0:25,34 --> 0:0:28,96
And you'll notice that the
aliens of the future only have


16
0:0:28,96 --> 0:0:30,9
four fingers.


17
0:0:30,9 --> 0:0:33,65
And you should always have
good safety glasses.


18
0:0:33,65 --> 0:0:35,86
So always wear your
safety glasses.


19
0:0:35,86 --> 0:0:39,88
And just in case a bomb was to
go off, you should have ear


20
0:0:39,88 --> 0:0:41,4
protection as well.


21
0:0:41,4 --> 0:0:43,85
It also lets you stop
hearing people say,


22
0:0:43,85 --> 0:0:45,13
don't try this at home.


23
0:0:45,13 --> 0:0:50,1
And then, if all else fails,
have a safety mask.


24
0:0:50,1 --> 0:0:53,89
If you do all those things, you
can try most anything that


25
0:0:53,89 --> 0:0:56,31
we say it is OK for you
to try at home.


26
0:0:56,31 --> 0:0:58,555
But please know that the lawyers
say that you can only


27
0:0:58,555 --> 0:1:1,42
try the things that involve
carnations, food coloring,


28
0:1:1,42 --> 0:1:4,45
milk, Elmer's glue,
and paper clips.


29
0:1:4,45 --> 0:1:7,94
Everything else, off-limits.


30
0:1:7,94 --> 0:1:9,918
Was that good?


31
0:1:9,918 --> 0:1:11,168
Knock yourself out.


32
0:1:11,168 --> 0:1:14,88



33
0:1:14,88 --> 0:1:16,56
CARLY REED: Like so many things
around here it all


34
0:1:16,56 --> 0:1:18,6
starts with a phone call.


35
0:1:18,6 --> 0:1:21,96
Anywhere from a Boy Scout troop
to "The Ellen Show"


36
0:1:21,96 --> 0:1:22,51
could call.


37
0:1:22,51 --> 0:1:25,12
And in this case, the Colorado
Rockies called.


38
0:1:25,12 --> 0:1:27,67
They wanted Steve to come do an
event that teachers could


39
0:1:27,67 --> 0:1:31,745
bring their students to that
would be somewhat educational,


40
0:1:31,745 --> 0:1:33,89
and then stick around and
watch the baseball game


41
0:1:33,89 --> 0:1:34,596
afterwards.


42
0:1:34,596 --> 0:1:36,55
STEVE SPANGLER: So they want
me to team up with Kathy


43
0:1:36,55 --> 0:1:38,28
Sabine, who's our meteorologist
at 9NEWS.


44
0:1:38,28 --> 0:1:40,33
And together, we're going to
take some of the demos that


45
0:1:40,33 --> 0:1:43,713
we've done on TV and somehow
play them at a big field like


46
0:1:43,713 --> 0:1:44,5
Coors Field.


47
0:1:44,5 --> 0:1:48,27
The original proposal was that
they're going to take some


48
0:1:48,27 --> 0:1:51,142
kids and get them down close to
the dugout and Kathy and I


49
0:1:51,142 --> 0:1:54,425
would stand on the Colorado
Rockies dugout and just


50
0:1:54,425 --> 0:1:55,76
address these 200 kids.


51
0:1:55,76 --> 0:1:58,94
Within a week that went to,
well, maybe that's 2,000.


52
0:1:58,94 --> 0:2:1,56
And now ticket sales are
at almost 5,000.


53
0:2:1,56 --> 0:2:5,0
The kicker is they want some
interactive activity that can


54
0:2:5,0 --> 0:2:7,76
happen in the stands, that the
people there watching can do


55
0:2:7,76 --> 0:2:9,38
at the same time that we're
doing it down on the field.


56
0:2:9,38 --> 0:2:12,32
So in essence, I have to do a
hands-on science experiment


57
0:2:12,32 --> 0:2:17,32
with however many people-- let's
just say 5,000 people.


58
0:2:17,32 --> 0:2:20,27
I don't know exactly what that's
going to be just yet.


59
0:2:20,27 --> 0:2:22,61
CARLY REED: Steve said that I
needed to talk to Jeff to pull


60
0:2:22,61 --> 0:2:25,33
the whole team together to get
a bunch of experiments


61
0:2:25,33 --> 0:2:28,33
together and go outside and try
them out, kind of like a


62
0:2:28,33 --> 0:2:29,83
big play day for us.


63
0:2:29,83 --> 0:2:31,13
BRIAN FIROOZ: All right.


64
0:2:31,13 --> 0:2:32,38
So this is a solar bag.


65
0:2:32,38 --> 0:2:36,58



66
0:2:36,58 --> 0:2:38,34
We're going to have to--


67
0:2:38,34 --> 0:2:41,89
so solar bags are really
tightly wound.


68
0:2:41,89 --> 0:2:46,65
And as you open them up,
it's kind of how--


69
0:2:46,65 --> 0:2:48,425
just kind of like
a garbage bag.


70
0:2:48,425 --> 0:2:50,75
Nothing real special or anything
like that about that.


71
0:2:50,75 --> 0:2:52,68
But we're going to want to make
sure when we're on the


72
0:2:52,68 --> 0:2:55,53
field that they're going to be
opened ahead of time, since


73
0:2:55,53 --> 0:2:57,55
they are kind of folded upon
themselves, we're going to


74
0:2:57,55 --> 0:3:0,87
want to pump a little air
through them so that they get


75
0:3:0,87 --> 0:3:4,389
open and the plastic isn't
folded on top of itself and


76
0:3:4,389 --> 0:3:4,97
stuff like that.


77
0:3:4,97 --> 0:3:6,45
So it's a really simple--


78
0:3:6,45 --> 0:3:9,929



79
0:3:9,929 --> 0:3:10,426
really simple.


80
0:3:10,426 --> 0:3:13,738
You just get a little bit of air
and then go ahead and push


81
0:3:13,738 --> 0:3:14,899
it through.


82
0:3:14,899 --> 0:3:18,378
And that'll have it just kind of
start to open up on itself.


83
0:3:18,378 --> 0:3:27,83



84
0:3:27,83 --> 0:3:29,6
And that's it.


85
0:3:29,6 --> 0:3:30,4
STEVE SPANGLER: So we've been


86
0:3:30,4 --> 0:3:31,935
manufacturing these giant bags.


87
0:3:31,935 --> 0:3:34,78
It's nothing more than just
a giant trash bag.


88
0:3:34,78 --> 0:3:35,77
It's 50 feet long.


89
0:3:35,77 --> 0:3:38,85
It's about three feet in
diameter, holds a tremendous


90
0:3:38,85 --> 0:3:39,88
amount of air.


91
0:3:39,88 --> 0:3:42,97
The secret is it's made out
of a very thin plastic.


92
0:3:42,97 --> 0:3:46,56
And of course the color of the
bag is black, so that black


93
0:3:46,56 --> 0:3:49,2
bag absorbs the heat
from the sun.


94
0:3:49,2 --> 0:3:51,46
So as you run with it, you scoop
up the air and then you


95
0:3:51,46 --> 0:3:51,86
tie it off.


96
0:3:51,86 --> 0:3:55,24
And within seconds, you can
already start to feel that air


97
0:3:55,24 --> 0:3:56,54
start to heat up.


98
0:3:56,54 --> 0:3:59,42
And literally, two to three
minutes later, you start to


99
0:3:59,42 --> 0:4:1,29
see the buoyancy factor
of that bag.


100
0:4:1,29 --> 0:4:3,78
It becomes almost like
a solar sausage that


101
0:4:3,78 --> 0:4:5,59
floats up into the sky.


102
0:4:5,59 --> 0:4:8,23
It's a really, really cool
way to be able to teach


103
0:4:8,23 --> 0:4:9,48
that hot air rises.


104
0:4:9,48 --> 0:4:15,38



105
0:4:15,38 --> 0:4:16,115
We're doing good.


106
0:4:16,115 --> 0:4:19,11
We have a slight tear.


107
0:4:19,11 --> 0:4:20,3
But everything's all right.


108
0:4:20,3 --> 0:4:28,596
[MUSIC PLAYING]


109
0:4:28,596 --> 0:4:29,84
FEMALE SPEAKER: No!


110
0:4:29,84 --> 0:4:29,572
No!


111
0:4:29,572 --> 0:4:30,822
No!


112
0:4:30,822 --> 0:4:39,35



113
0:4:39,35 --> 0:4:42,76
STEVE SPANGLER: I do best when
I get to rally the troops, go


114
0:4:42,76 --> 0:4:45,21
grab a whole bunch of demos,
and take them and start


115
0:4:45,21 --> 0:4:45,71
playing with them.


116
0:4:45,71 --> 0:4:46,99
Because it's only when we start
playing with them that


117
0:4:46,99 --> 0:4:49,74
we know this is going to work
or stumble over this one.


118
0:4:49,74 --> 0:4:52,39
And we'll actually create
something new out of it.


119
0:4:52,39 --> 0:4:54,85
So this play is really,
really important.


120
0:4:54,85 --> 0:4:56,31
So here's what's happening.


121
0:4:56,31 --> 0:4:58,93
The liquid nitrogen's going
inside the bottle.


122
0:4:58,93 --> 0:5:1,63
It's a pretty slow process,
because the liquid nitrogen


123
0:5:1,63 --> 0:5:2,17
wants to come out.


124
0:5:2,17 --> 0:5:4,39
So it's 320 degrees
below zero.


125
0:5:4,39 --> 0:5:7,64
And the trick is just a nice
slow pour to fill it up.


126
0:5:7,64 --> 0:5:9,35
So a slow pour.


127
0:5:9,35 --> 0:5:13,98



128
0:5:13,98 --> 0:5:14,55
BRIAN FIROOZ: Good job, Carly.


129
0:5:14,55 --> 0:5:16,453
CARLY REED: I can't see
the bottom of it.


130
0:5:16,453 --> 0:5:17,399
STEVE SPANGLER: That's OK.


131
0:5:17,399 --> 0:5:18,818
BRIAN FIROOZ: You're
doing all right.


132
0:5:18,818 --> 0:5:19,764
STEVE SPANGLER: Keep going.


133
0:5:19,764 --> 0:5:22,129
Keep going.


134
0:5:22,129 --> 0:5:22,61
You're doing fine.


135
0:5:22,61 --> 0:5:24,53
So here's that slow pour.


136
0:5:24,53 --> 0:5:26,97
So right now, the liquid
nitrogen is trying to turn


137
0:5:26,97 --> 0:5:28,22
into a gas.


138
0:5:28,22 --> 0:5:29,99
So it's 320 degrees.


139
0:5:29,99 --> 0:5:32,4
And what is it, about
70 degrees out here?


140
0:5:32,4 --> 0:5:33,2
So there's a difference.


141
0:5:33,2 --> 0:5:34,92
The water in there
is just basically


142
0:5:34,92 --> 0:5:36,62
room temperature water.


143
0:5:36,62 --> 0:5:38,27
So I think you're good.


144
0:5:38,27 --> 0:5:40,46
OK?


145
0:5:40,46 --> 0:5:40,898
All right.


146
0:5:40,898 --> 0:5:41,92
So that's out of the way.


147
0:5:41,92 --> 0:5:43,12
That can go down.


148
0:5:43,12 --> 0:5:44,81
MALE SPEAKER: So Steve, your
goal is a third full.


149
0:5:44,81 --> 0:5:45,2
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


150
0:5:45,2 --> 0:5:45,98
A third full.


151
0:5:45,98 --> 0:5:46,37
MALE SPEAKER: I'll put
a line on there.


152
0:5:46,37 --> 0:5:46,458
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


153
0:5:46,458 --> 0:5:48,8
So now everybody's
going to show it.


154
0:5:48,8 --> 0:5:48,19
OK.


155
0:5:48,19 --> 0:5:49,0
Got it?


156
0:5:49,0 --> 0:5:49,36
Good.


157
0:5:49,36 --> 0:5:49,943
Twist it on.


158
0:5:49,943 --> 0:5:50,326
MALE SPEAKER: Soon as
it's sealed, Brian,


159
0:5:50,326 --> 0:5:52,0
just drop it in.


160
0:5:52,0 --> 0:5:53,5
STEVE SPANGLER: Twist it hard.


161
0:5:53,5 --> 0:5:54,4
Good.


162
0:5:54,4 --> 0:5:56,84
So here's what we're trying
to demonstrate.


163
0:5:56,84 --> 0:5:59,62
Liquid nitrogen, when it goes
from a liquid into a gas,


164
0:5:59,62 --> 0:6:2,75
expands 700 times.


165
0:6:2,75 --> 0:6:5,64
And because it's in that
plastic, you can actually see


166
0:6:5,64 --> 0:6:6,99
the energy that's released.


167
0:6:6,99 --> 0:6:9,45
And of course, it's important
to point out, you don't try


168
0:6:9,45 --> 0:6:10,32
this at home.


169
0:6:10,32 --> 0:6:12,712
We're in a testing facility with
emergency personnel right


170
0:6:12,712 --> 0:6:13,962
around the corner.


171
0:6:13,962 --> 0:6:23,19



172
0:6:23,19 --> 0:6:25,31
So the company I work
with is 9NEWS.


173
0:6:25,31 --> 0:6:29,11
And being a big media company,
they've got cool toys.


174
0:6:29,11 --> 0:6:31,63
And they said that we have use
of the helicopter that day.


175
0:6:31,63 --> 0:6:32,96
So totally cool.


176
0:6:32,96 --> 0:6:35,79
Helicopter comes over, gets this
aerial shot of all these


177
0:6:35,79 --> 0:6:37,42
kids doing science.


178
0:6:37,42 --> 0:6:39,645
Hard part is, I've got to figure
out something for all


179
0:6:39,645 --> 0:6:41,62
the kids to do that the
helicopter can see.


180
0:6:41,62 --> 0:6:43,17
So this little thing's
not going to work.


181
0:6:43,17 --> 0:6:44,55
So that's why I'm thinking
these big wind


182
0:6:44,55 --> 0:6:45,47
bags will play well.


183
0:6:45,47 --> 0:6:47,94
They're colorful, and hopefully
from the air you can


184
0:6:47,94 --> 0:6:51,7
see just this sea of
science going on.


185
0:6:51,7 --> 0:6:52,31
It could be cool.


186
0:6:52,31 --> 0:6:54,62
So I think this is the solution
for the interactive


187
0:6:54,62 --> 0:6:56,4
activity with everybody
in the stands.


188
0:6:56,4 --> 0:6:57,9
They're wind bags.


189
0:6:57,9 --> 0:6:59,54
I've been doing this for years
and years and years.


190
0:6:59,54 --> 0:7:0,85
So it's a great big long bag.


191
0:7:0,85 --> 0:7:3,38
It's like a plastic
sandwich bag.


192
0:7:3,38 --> 0:7:5,59
If you're at home, it's like
a Diaper Genie refill.


193
0:7:5,59 --> 0:7:8,215
And the object is, how many
breaths would it take to blow


194
0:7:8,215 --> 0:7:9,63
up this eight-foot-long bag.


195
0:7:9,63 --> 0:7:11,505
So you can see how kind
of colorful they are.


196
0:7:11,505 --> 0:7:13,4
Here, you tie up one
end like this.


197
0:7:13,4 --> 0:7:14,88
Hang on there.


198
0:7:14,88 --> 0:7:16,986
And then you're supposed to
guess how many breaths it


199
0:7:16,986 --> 0:7:17,44
would take.


200
0:7:17,44 --> 0:7:19,4
And everybody does
it like this.


201
0:7:19,4 --> 0:7:21,61



202
0:7:21,61 --> 0:7:26,88
And they slide it down and say
it would take you like 15, 20


203
0:7:26,88 --> 0:7:28,17
breaths to blow up the bag.


204
0:7:28,17 --> 0:7:31,63
So since it's weather and
science day, if you use


205
0:7:31,63 --> 0:7:34,73
Bernoulli's principle that says
fast-moving air creates


206
0:7:34,73 --> 0:7:37,516
this area of lower pressure, you
can actually blow up the


207
0:7:37,516 --> 0:7:38,87
bag in one breath.


208
0:7:38,87 --> 0:7:39,4
So watch.


209
0:7:39,4 --> 0:7:39,99
You empty it out like this.


210
0:7:39,99 --> 0:7:41,27
Here, hang on to the end here.


211
0:7:41,27 --> 0:7:41,41
All right.


212
0:7:41,41 --> 0:7:43,9
No go back a little ways.


213
0:7:43,9 --> 0:7:43,585
So now watch.


214
0:7:43,585 --> 0:7:45,915
If you stretch it out like this,
the secret is you've got


215
0:7:45,915 --> 0:7:47,11
to keep your mouth
off the bag.


216
0:7:47,11 --> 0:7:50,29
If you open it up like this,
see, and then you blow into


217
0:7:50,29 --> 0:7:54,2
the bag, this fast-moving stream
of air actually creates


218
0:7:54,2 --> 0:7:56,43
this area of lower pressure
and the air around it goes


219
0:7:56,43 --> 0:7:56,94
into the bag.


220
0:7:56,94 --> 0:7:59,46
So watch.


221
0:7:59,46 --> 0:8:0,636
See that?


222
0:8:0,636 --> 0:8:1,452
Ta da!


223
0:8:1,452 --> 0:8:2,71
It's good, huh?


224
0:8:2,71 --> 0:8:3,5
Oh.


225
0:8:3,5 --> 0:8:5,64
If you want to do this at home
and you don't have a colored


226
0:8:5,64 --> 0:8:10,9
bag like this, sandwich bag,
here's what you use is a


227
0:8:10,9 --> 0:8:11,68
Diaper Genie refill.


228
0:8:11,68 --> 0:8:15,6
So these things that
you put diapers in.


229
0:8:15,6 --> 0:8:18,87
So if you pull out a section of
Diaper Genie, just make it


230
0:8:18,87 --> 0:8:20,28
as long as you want
and cut it off.


231
0:8:20,28 --> 0:8:23,16
You can do the same
exact thing.


232
0:8:23,16 --> 0:8:24,72
Now it smells baby
fresh, right?


233
0:8:24,72 --> 0:8:26,51
Just remembering that you've
got to keep your mouth away


234
0:8:26,51 --> 0:8:27,24
from the bag.


235
0:8:27,24 --> 0:8:29,86
And if you blow from far away,
this fast-moving air creates


236
0:8:29,86 --> 0:8:31,64
this area of lower pressure,
blow up the


237
0:8:31,64 --> 0:8:33,72
bag in a single breath.


238
0:8:33,72 --> 0:8:34,289
It's pretty cool.


239
0:8:34,289 --> 0:8:37,26
Now the hard part is meeting
with the executives of the


240
0:8:37,26 --> 0:8:39,52
Colorado Rockies and to get them
to sign off, because they


241
0:8:39,52 --> 0:8:41,9
now have to see everything
that we're going to


242
0:8:41,9 --> 0:8:42,2
do down on the field.


243
0:8:42,2 --> 0:8:46,29
So I somehow have to sell them
on the idea that all these


244
0:8:46,29 --> 0:8:47,54
things are good.


245
0:8:47,54 --> 0:8:50,75
So 19th and Wazee for
the Chophouse.


246
0:8:50,75 --> 0:8:51,14
Yes.


247
0:8:51,14 --> 0:8:53,12
We're going to go around
the Chophouse.


248
0:8:53,12 --> 0:8:54,742
We're going to work in there.


249
0:8:54,742 --> 0:9:3,89
[MUSIC PLAYING]


250
0:9:3,89 --> 0:9:4,562
MALE SPEAKER: If there was
ever a day to be on time,


251
0:9:4,562 --> 0:9:6,526
today should have been it.


252
0:9:6,526 --> 0:9:21,31



253
0:9:21,31 --> 0:9:22,84
STEVE SPANGLER: So kids, who
wants to learn about the


254
0:9:22,84 --> 0:9:23,95
properties of air?


255
0:9:23,95 --> 0:9:24,37
AUDIENCE: We do!


256
0:9:24,37 --> 0:9:26,5
We do!


257
0:9:26,5 --> 0:9:28,109
STEVE SPANGLER: Bring some
of your friends.


258
0:9:28,109 --> 0:9:29,576
MALE SPEAKER: I have
none, have none!


259
0:9:29,576 --> 0:9:37,4



260
0:9:37,4 --> 0:9:38,11
MALE SPEAKER: I think
this is going to be


261
0:9:38,11 --> 0:9:39,18
quite a wonderful event.


262
0:9:39,18 --> 0:9:42,19
Most of the Rockies anticipate
[INAUDIBLE].


263
0:9:42,19 --> 0:10:3,26
[MUSIC PLAYING]


264
0:10:3,26 --> 0:10:4,91
STEVE SPANGLER: I didn't expect
any pushback at all


265
0:10:4,91 --> 0:10:5,35
with this one.


266
0:10:5,35 --> 0:10:7,65
And this is the one I got the
most notes on, the solar


267
0:10:7,65 --> 0:10:9,34
sausage, that solar bag.


268
0:10:9,34 --> 0:10:11,25
So you run across the field.


269
0:10:11,25 --> 0:10:13,26
So before any of our team was
allowed on the field, we had


270
0:10:13,26 --> 0:10:15,42
to go over the rules
and regulations of


271
0:10:15,42 --> 0:10:15,89
being on the field.


272
0:10:15,89 --> 0:10:17,49
And as long as we were on the
outfield kind of running


273
0:10:17,49 --> 0:10:18,52
around, everything was OK.


274
0:10:18,52 --> 0:10:21,79
So after everybody got trained,
they loved that idea


275
0:10:21,79 --> 0:10:22,96
of the solar bags.


276
0:10:22,96 --> 0:10:25,33
And I think it's probably the
best educational point that we


277
0:10:25,33 --> 0:10:28,4
have in the show, because
teachers can really show their


278
0:10:28,4 --> 0:10:31,38
kids and use it as an
illustration that those


279
0:10:31,38 --> 0:10:35,266
balloons fill with air, the sun
heats the air, and all of


280
0:10:35,266 --> 0:10:38,63
a sudden, the kids should be
able to see them rise, like


281
0:10:38,63 --> 0:10:39,99
they're doing the program.


282
0:10:39,99 --> 0:10:42,181
So pretty cool science lesson
at the same time.


283
0:10:42,181 --> 0:10:47,16



284
0:10:47,16 --> 0:10:49,932
MALE SPEAKER: How much will you
give me if I huck this at


285
0:10:49,932 --> 0:10:52,824
that solar bag and nail
it in the air?


286
0:10:52,824 --> 0:10:55,843
If you agree, don't
say anything.


287
0:10:55,843 --> 0:11:3,208
[LAUGHTER]

0:11:3,208 --> 0:11:4,458
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


289
0:11:4,458 --> 0:11:10,573



290
0:11:10,573 --> 0:11:12,8
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh!


291
0:11:12,8 --> 0:11:13,97
STEVE SPANGLER: What
did you do?


292
0:11:13,97 --> 0:11:15,62
You tried just to step
on it, didn't you?


293
0:11:15,62 --> 0:11:16,103
FEMALE SPEAKER: No!


294
0:11:16,103 --> 0:11:16,586
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


295
0:11:16,586 --> 0:11:18,35
FEMALE SPEAKER: No.


296
0:11:18,35 --> 0:11:20,45
Video will show--


297
0:11:20,45 --> 0:11:20,66
MALE SPEAKER: OK.


298
0:11:20,66 --> 0:11:21,73
New plan.


299
0:11:21,73 --> 0:11:25,48
I casually walk by Jeff's
strings, solar bag string, and


300
0:11:25,48 --> 0:11:26,5
just snip it.


301
0:11:26,5 --> 0:11:27,3
What do you think?


302
0:11:27,3 --> 0:11:28,78
If you agree, don't
say anything.


303
0:11:28,78 --> 0:11:31,391
Silence is the same
as complicity.


304
0:11:31,391 --> 0:11:32,641
OK.


305
0:11:32,641 --> 0:11:35,63



306
0:11:35,63 --> 0:11:37,33
STEVE SPANGLER: What we're going
to do is let Kathy talk


307
0:11:37,33 --> 0:11:39,61
and let some of this happen
behind us at the same time, so


308
0:11:39,61 --> 0:11:43,27
that we can [INAUDIBLE].


309
0:11:43,27 --> 0:11:44,18
All right.


310
0:11:44,18 --> 0:11:44,914
Let's go.


311
0:11:44,914 --> 0:11:46,258
We'll talk about this outside.


312
0:11:46,258 --> 0:11:47,61
We'll get out of the sun.


313
0:11:47,61 --> 0:11:48,96
CARLY REED: So I'm working on
the event, and details are


314
0:11:48,96 --> 0:11:51,18
finally starting to
come together.


315
0:11:51,18 --> 0:11:54,339
And then I look over at Steve's
office and he's on the


316
0:11:54,339 --> 0:11:55,8
phone with someone.


317
0:11:55,8 --> 0:11:57,25
And as soon he hangs up, he
lets us know that he's now


318
0:11:57,25 --> 0:11:59,768
going for a Guinness world
record on this event.


319
0:11:59,768 --> 0:12:3,44
So just one more thing.


320
0:12:3,44 --> 0:12:5,79
STEVE SPANGLER: Of all the
things we can control, the one


321
0:12:5,79 --> 0:12:7,75
thing I can't control,
the weather.


322
0:12:7,75 --> 0:12:11,26
So they're saying a possibility
of rain or snow.


323
0:12:11,26 --> 0:12:12,66
So it could be one
of these freak


324
0:12:12,66 --> 0:12:14,75
snowstorms in the spring.


325
0:12:14,75 --> 0:12:17,18
So can't control it.


326
0:12:17,18 --> 0:12:18,63
Just have to kind of
work around it.


327
0:12:18,63 --> 0:12:21,338
And our team will work hard
to pull it off it anyway.


328
0:12:21,338 --> 0:12:24,831
I just don't want kids cold
out there in the morning


329
0:12:24,831 --> 0:12:25,829
watching this.


330
0:12:25,829 --> 0:12:27,825
And snow would be a disaster.


331
0:12:27,825 --> 0:12:30,32
So crossing my fingers
for sun.


332
0:12:30,32 --> 0:12:33,83



333
0:12:33,83 --> 0:12:35,33
I want you to know the
number that gives


334
0:12:35,33 --> 0:12:37,43
us the highest geysers.


335
0:12:37,43 --> 0:12:42,23
That's over 7,000 bags
in under 2 minutes.


336
0:12:42,23 --> 0:12:45,53
This is going to be awesome.


337
0:12:45,53 --> 0:12:46,78
FEMALE SPEAKER: Can we
do that again, Steve?


338
0:12:46,78 --> 0:14:46,78
