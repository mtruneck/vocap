1
0:0:1,367 --> 0:0:4,447
<i>As a doctor</i>
<i>you need to be prepared for anything:</i>


2
0:0:4,447 --> 0:0:7,127
<i>Heart attacks</i>
<i>drug overdoses gunshot wounds,</i>


3
0:0:7,127 --> 0:0:9,247
<i>But one thing you can't prepare for</i>


4
0:0:9,247 --> 0:0:13,7
<i>is what happens</i>
<i>after you break up with a co-worker,</i>


5
0:0:13,7 --> 0:0:16,407
- Watch where you're walking!
- You watch where you're walking.


6
0:0:16,407 --> 0:0:18,167
<i>Get the last word in,</i>


7
0:0:18,167 --> 0:0:23,47
- You watch where you're walking!
- You watch where you're walking!


8
0:0:23,47 --> 0:0:31,727
<i>Try as hard as you can to avoid them</i>
<i>you're bound to run into 'em one day,</i>


9
0:0:31,727 --> 0:0:36,447
<i>And the next day,</i>


10
0:0:36,447 --> 0:0:39,807
<i>And the next day,</i>


11
0:0:39,807 --> 0:0:47,47
- You don't even play sports.
- This helps me to relieve stress!


12
0:0:47,47 --> 0:0:51,687
Feel better?


13
0:0:51,687 --> 0:0:55,767
l do now.


14
0:0:55,767 --> 0:0:57,847
- Girl problems?
- How'd you know?


15
0:0:57,847 --> 0:1:0,767
You look like you got problems.
You're a girl.


16
0:1:0,767 --> 0:1:3,207
Hence, girl problems.
Watch your nails.


17
0:1:3,207 --> 0:1:6,607
<i>The only positive is that</i>
<i>a hospital's like one big family,</i>


18
0:1:6,607 --> 0:1:10,647
<i>So if one relationship ends</i>
<i>there are others around you can rely on,</i>


19
0:1:10,647 --> 0:1:16,247
- Dr Cox, l was wondering...
- l'd say you're about a B-cup.


20
0:1:16,247 --> 0:1:18,687
At least they're real.


21
0:1:18,687 --> 0:1:37,327
<i>Yep it's a good place to heal,</i>


22
0:1:37,327 --> 0:1:42,127
Look, Mom, l gotta go.


23
0:1:42,127 --> 0:1:46,767
He did?


24
0:1:46,767 --> 0:1:51,607
Yeah. All right. l love you too. Bye.


25
0:1:51,607 --> 0:1:56,847
My high school teacher,
Mr Peters, died.


26
0:1:56,847 --> 0:1:59,327
- Was a great guy.
- You OK?


27
0:1:59,327 --> 0:2:1,647
<i>Even though I see death</i>
<i>all the time now</i>


28
0:2:1,647 --> 0:2:4,127
<i>I still react the same way</i>
<i>as when I was a kid,</i>


29
0:2:4,127 --> 0:2:6,847
Doin' a lot better than Mr Peters.


30
0:2:6,847 --> 0:2:8,927
- Dude.
- What's up, newbie?


31
0:2:8,927 --> 0:2:11,807
My favourite
high school teacher just died.


32
0:2:11,807 --> 0:2:14,967
The correct answer is, ''Nothing, sir''.


33
0:2:14,967 --> 0:2:19,407
My God. Would you look at this hellhole?


34
0:2:19,407 --> 0:2:21,887
lf l see more broken-down equipment,


35
0:2:21,887 --> 0:2:26,327
one more gomer shuffled back and forth
between some godforsaken home,


36
0:2:26,327 --> 0:2:28,807
one more patient denied treatment


37
0:2:28,807 --> 0:2:32,367
because they got
the wrong insurance, l...


38
0:2:32,367 --> 0:2:35,927
There are times when
l concentrate as hard as l can


39
0:2:35,927 --> 0:2:39,47
to see if l can
catch on fire like the Human Torch.


40
0:2:39,47 --> 0:2:41,967
And mark my words, newbie,
if l ever pull it off,


41
0:2:41,967 --> 0:2:44,647
l will be back here
to destroy this place.


42
0:2:44,647 --> 0:2:46,807
l used to like the Silver Surfer.


43
0:2:46,807 --> 0:2:49,87
- Hang ten! Hang...
- Get in here.


44
0:2:49,87 --> 0:2:51,807
<i>After a while</i>
<i>you get used to Dr Cox's rants,</i>


45
0:2:51,807 --> 0:2:54,447
And the lab tech
is nowhere to be found,


46
0:2:54,447 --> 0:2:57,567
so l can't get that
tox screen l was looking for.


47
0:2:57,567 --> 0:3:0,327
What do you say we write him
a friendly note?


48
0:3:0,327 --> 0:3:2,7
''Dear


49
0:3:2,7 --> 0:3:3,647
incompetent


50
0:3:3,647 --> 0:3:7,127
dumb-ass.''


51
0:3:7,127 --> 0:3:13,247
<i>The truth is Dr Cox isn't really</i>
<i>angry he's just amusing himself,</i>


52
0:3:13,247 --> 0:3:18,367
<i>Maybe he's a little angry,</i>


53
0:3:18,367 --> 0:3:20,727
We didn't need those.


54
0:3:20,727 --> 0:3:30,287
So, all done?


55
0:3:30,287 --> 0:3:36,247
He broke his pencil.


56
0:3:36,247 --> 0:3:39,527
Turk, you'll be happy
you picked me to co-write this study.


57
0:3:39,527 --> 0:3:43,607
Hell, yeah. l thought we'd start off
by having a couple of beers.


58
0:3:43,607 --> 0:3:46,687
l got all the info
on peripheral vascular disease,


59
0:3:46,687 --> 0:3:49,87
highlighted passages and coded them


60
0:3:49,87 --> 0:3:51,767
to correspond with
the outline in your packet.


61
0:3:51,767 --> 0:3:53,927
But l don't have a packet.


62
0:3:53,927 --> 0:3:56,7
Look at that. Turk's packet.


63
0:3:56,7 --> 0:3:58,367
- So you did this last night?
- Yeah.


64
0:3:58,367 --> 0:4:2,847
- Why? What'd you do?
- Carla had to work, so l scarfed down


65
0:4:2,847 --> 0:4:5,927
a bunch of fast food
and got back home at around seven.


66
0:4:5,927 --> 0:4:10,247
Then l went to the bathroom at eight.
l got outta there at 1 1 .1 5.


67
0:4:10,247 --> 0:4:13,167
lt was a good night!


68
0:4:13,167 --> 0:4:15,767
l'm a nervous poo-er.


69
0:4:15,767 --> 0:4:19,407
You are not gonna
believe what Dr Cox...


70
0:4:19,407 --> 0:4:22,687
- lt's you.
- Yeah. lt's me.


71
0:4:22,687 --> 0:4:27,127
<i>Could Turk have picked anyone</i>
<i>worse to be doing this project with?</i>


72
0:4:27,127 --> 0:4:30,807
lf this is a peripheral vascular
disease study,


73
0:4:30,807 --> 0:4:35,687
then l'd exclude all claudication
patients not on pentoxifylline.


74
0:4:35,687 --> 0:4:38,887
What're you lookin' at?


75
0:4:38,887 --> 0:4:42,687
l'm gonna go to bed.


76
0:4:42,687 --> 0:4:46,47
Elliot, are you gonna go with him?


77
0:4:46,47 --> 0:4:49,207
Too early for jokes?
That's good to know.


78
0:4:49,207 --> 0:4:54,407
lt's good to know.


79
0:4:54,407 --> 0:4:57,607
lnteresting. lt isn't often
l'm paged by a nurse.


80
0:4:57,607 --> 0:5:0,207
The last time was when...


81
0:5:0,207 --> 0:5:3,287
What was her name?
She hasn't worked here since.


82
0:5:3,287 --> 0:5:6,287
Never mind. What can l do
for you and your coma patient?


83
0:5:6,287 --> 0:5:8,887
l came across
Mr Rice's advance directive,


84
0:5:8,887 --> 0:5:11,807
and he has a few requests
he would like us to honour.


85
0:5:11,807 --> 0:5:14,127
Let's see.
Blinds open? That's done.


86
0:5:14,127 --> 0:5:18,967
lncense burning?


87
0:5:18,967 --> 0:5:21,487
Close enough. Glad you called.


88
0:5:21,487 --> 0:5:26,647
Dr Kelso, he also wants to hear
Poison's <i>Talk Dirty to Me</i> once a day.


89
0:5:26,647 --> 0:5:29,327
He wants to hear whose what?


90
0:5:29,327 --> 0:5:31,407
Poison.
lt's a heavy metal band.


91
0:5:31,407 --> 0:5:34,7
Like Mötley Crüe and Winger.


92
0:5:34,7 --> 0:5:36,87
My son was a bit of a headbanger.


93
0:5:36,87 --> 0:5:40,47
- l'll get a tape deck in here...
- Nurse Espinosa, that's not necessary.


94
0:5:40,47 --> 0:5:43,847
- lt's just one song.
- lt starts out as just one song.


95
0:5:43,847 --> 0:5:46,727
But then half of the hospital staff


96
0:5:46,727 --> 0:5:51,327
is piercing their genitalia
and fornicating in the back of vans.


97
0:5:51,327 --> 0:5:54,527
Unless a family member
enforces the directive,


98
0:5:54,527 --> 0:5:56,607
we don't have to do anything.


99
0:5:56,607 --> 0:5:58,967
Now, will you do me a favour


100
0:5:58,967 --> 0:6:3,7
and just forget about it,
sweetheart?


101
0:6:3,7 --> 0:6:4,807
Of course.


102
0:6:4,807 --> 0:6:7,967
Can you help me
locate one of his family members?


103
0:6:7,967 --> 0:6:12,567
l could try to locate one through some
legal channels, but l'm really swamped.


104
0:6:12,567 --> 0:6:15,167
l love your worry lines.
They're adorable.


105
0:6:15,167 --> 0:6:18,247
They're like sexy
little forehead smiles.


106
0:6:18,247 --> 0:6:20,687
Careful, l've been hurt before.


107
0:6:20,687 --> 0:6:23,447
You won't believe
what happened yesterday.


108
0:6:23,447 --> 0:6:27,407
Dr Cox went ballistic
and destroyed an entire lab room.


109
0:6:27,407 --> 0:6:32,207
Broken computers, chairs
through windows, shattered beakers.


110
0:6:32,207 --> 0:6:35,167
Beakers.
How is this is not good gossip?


111
0:6:35,167 --> 0:6:38,287
JD, he does this every year.
And whatever you do,


112
0:6:38,287 --> 0:6:41,967
don't get caught in his wake,
because he'll take you down.


113
0:6:41,967 --> 0:6:44,367
Downtown.


114
0:6:44,367 --> 0:6:50,967
All the way?


115
0:6:50,967 --> 0:6:56,487
lt's OK, boy. Who is it?


116
0:6:56,487 --> 0:7:1,967
Little piggy, open up this door
or l will start huffing and puffing.


117
0:7:1,967 --> 0:7:9,527
But, Dr Cox, l... OK!


118
0:7:9,527 --> 0:7:12,207
Dear Lord,
please tell me that's not a onesie.


119
0:7:12,207 --> 0:7:14,7
l'd invite you in...


120
0:7:14,7 --> 0:7:16,767
- l've no interest in coming in.
- <i>Thank God,</i>


121
0:7:16,767 --> 0:7:19,727
We're goin' out.


122
0:7:19,727 --> 0:7:22,807
We can finish
the synopsis for chapter four,


123
0:7:22,807 --> 0:7:25,927
and process the Stegemann data
if we pull an all-nighter.


124
0:7:25,927 --> 0:7:29,927
- This isn't due for another month.
- But if we finish one week early,


125
0:7:29,927 --> 0:7:32,167
we can play with fonts and margins.


126
0:7:32,167 --> 0:7:34,567
Look...


127
0:7:34,567 --> 0:7:38,687
Tonight's date night with Carla,
and l got on special underwear.


128
0:7:38,687 --> 0:7:40,927
Go.


129
0:7:40,927 --> 0:7:43,487
Would you mind if l keep working?


130
0:7:43,487 --> 0:7:47,887
Yeah, that works for me.


131
0:7:47,887 --> 0:7:52,87
l'm wearing special underwear too.
They're invisible.


132
0:7:52,87 --> 0:7:54,207
Todd, l'm just kinda busy here.


133
0:7:54,207 --> 0:7:56,327
No time for the Todd.


134
0:7:56,327 --> 0:7:59,647
All the project geeks
are busy working tonight.


135
0:7:59,647 --> 0:8:1,327
Excuse me?


136
0:8:1,327 --> 0:8:4,607
All the surgical interns
picked a project geek from Medical


137
0:8:4,607 --> 0:8:7,767
- to write our reports for us.
- l'm not a geek.


138
0:8:7,767 --> 0:8:10,287
What's that on your finger?


139
0:8:10,287 --> 0:8:13,127
lt's a rubber thingy
to help me turn the pages...


140
0:8:13,127 --> 0:8:16,727
...quicker.


141
0:8:16,727 --> 0:8:20,607
She said ''rubber thingy''.


142
0:8:20,607 --> 0:8:23,687
Excuse me, nurse.
l'm ready for my sponge bath.


143
0:8:23,687 --> 0:8:25,887
l'm sorry, l can't.


144
0:8:25,887 --> 0:8:28,247
l gotta pick up a CD
for this coma patient.


145
0:8:28,247 --> 0:8:31,167
- But l'm wearing silk boxers.
- Turk...


146
0:8:31,167 --> 0:8:33,767
The ones with the dogs
holding big money bags.


147
0:8:33,767 --> 0:8:35,967
Sweetie, l love your money pants.


148
0:8:35,967 --> 0:8:39,407
lt's just that l feel somebody
needs to take care of this guy.


149
0:8:39,407 --> 0:8:42,687
How is it that you can blow me off
and it makes you sexier?


150
0:8:42,687 --> 0:8:45,527
- Cos you're whipped.
- l thought so.


151
0:8:45,527 --> 0:8:51,167
Thank you.


152
0:8:51,167 --> 0:8:53,447
Minty.


153
0:8:53,447 --> 0:8:56,127
So we're here.
What do you wanna talk about?


154
0:8:56,127 --> 0:8:59,247
lf you don't toss that shot back,
l'm gonna throw you


155
0:8:59,247 --> 0:9:7,487
up on the bar and make you sing
the theme song from <i>Endless Love,</i>


156
0:9:7,487 --> 0:9:10,527
- Yucky.
- Yucky?


157
0:9:10,527 --> 0:9:13,407
l'm drinking with a mouseketeer.


158
0:9:13,407 --> 0:9:15,7
Two more.


159
0:9:15,7 --> 0:9:19,407
lf you're not gonna talk to me, what's
the point of sitting alone in a bar?


160
0:9:19,407 --> 0:9:23,887
You know,
that's a good point. lt is.


161
0:9:23,887 --> 0:9:32,47
Excuse me, ladies. Do you know anybody
who might like a couple of free drinks?


162
0:9:32,47 --> 0:9:37,967
Hello, ladies.


163
0:9:37,967 --> 0:9:41,47
Yes, it's a onesie.


164
0:9:41,47 --> 0:9:43,367
Great news. l'm back for the night.


165
0:9:43,367 --> 0:9:45,967
You know what?


166
0:9:45,967 --> 0:9:49,407
The hell with you, Chris Turk.


167
0:9:49,407 --> 0:9:51,487
What the hell got into her?


168
0:9:51,487 --> 0:10:6,327
Wassup!


169
0:10:6,327 --> 0:10:8,207
Could you turn that off, please?


170
0:10:8,207 --> 0:10:11,47
What?


171
0:10:11,47 --> 0:10:15,767
l thought l told you not to play
that in the house... Hospital.


172
0:10:15,767 --> 0:10:18,207
l'm just trying
to do right by my patient.


173
0:10:18,207 --> 0:10:21,87
As of this moment,
he is no longer your patient.


174
0:10:21,87 --> 0:10:23,87
- Dr Kelso, you...
- Young lady,


175
0:10:23,87 --> 0:10:27,47
when l asked you to leave it alone,
l wasn't really asking you.


176
0:10:27,47 --> 0:10:30,887
lt's like when l ask the paperboy
to avoid hitting my rosebushes.


177
0:10:30,887 --> 0:10:33,887
l'm saying you damn well better do it


178
0:10:33,887 --> 0:10:36,967
or l'm going to forget
to put the chain on Baxter.


179
0:10:36,967 --> 0:10:42,127
Now get on out of here
and take that boom blaster with you!


180
0:10:42,127 --> 0:10:46,567
My relationship with Jeremy was
emotionally over before he ended it.


181
0:10:46,567 --> 0:10:49,287
Then l graduated from college
and met Ethan.


182
0:10:49,287 --> 0:10:52,327
You don't say?


183
0:10:52,327 --> 0:10:55,807
We had two good years
and two bad years, but not all at once.


184
0:10:55,807 --> 0:10:59,127
Of course.


185
0:10:59,127 --> 0:11:2,887
Dr Cox, don't get me wrong.


186
0:11:2,887 --> 0:11:6,407
Love getting drunk in my jammies
just as much as the next guy,


187
0:11:6,407 --> 0:11:8,527
but it's late, so...


188
0:11:8,527 --> 0:11:11,207
Thanks for coming out, newbie.


189
0:11:11,207 --> 0:11:14,87
Hope this whole thing
wasn't too yucky for you.


190
0:11:14,87 --> 0:11:16,927
You seem fine, so l'm...


191
0:11:16,927 --> 0:11:19,687
l am not fine.


192
0:11:19,687 --> 0:11:24,7
Why do you think we're out
here at this bar at two in the morning?


193
0:11:24,7 --> 0:11:26,887
Just so we can go in the urinal
and piss on the ice?


194
0:11:26,887 --> 0:11:29,47
l love to melt the middle.


195
0:11:29,47 --> 0:11:31,967
We're out here because
if l go home and go to sleep,


196
0:11:31,967 --> 0:11:36,807
the only thing l'll be able to think
about is l gotta go back to that place.


197
0:11:36,807 --> 0:11:39,567
And you wanna know something?


198
0:11:39,567 --> 0:11:41,767
l got nothing.


199
0:11:41,767 --> 0:11:53,727
Honest to God,
l got nothing. l'm cooked.


200
0:11:53,727 --> 0:11:58,407
You owe me $53.


201
0:11:58,407 --> 0:12:7,167
l think l left my wallet
in my other onesie.


202
0:12:7,167 --> 0:12:9,607
The bartender
let you skip out on the tab?


203
0:12:9,607 --> 0:12:12,527
He said l could pay him back
by giving him a physical,


204
0:12:12,527 --> 0:12:15,367
which is scary because
l never said l was a doctor.


205
0:12:15,367 --> 0:12:18,287
l warned you about
getting caught up in Dr Cox's wake.


206
0:12:18,287 --> 0:12:20,967
- Does he listen?
- You'd think so with those ears.


207
0:12:20,967 --> 0:12:23,7
Uncalled for.


208
0:12:23,7 --> 0:12:25,407
lt's different.
He showed up at my place.


209
0:12:25,407 --> 0:12:26,767
He showed up at my house.


210
0:12:26,767 --> 0:12:30,527
- Showed up at my mama's.
- Ruined my wedding.


211
0:12:30,527 --> 0:12:33,327
l know you think
he's gonna shake this off,


212
0:12:33,327 --> 0:12:36,447
but l connected with the guy,
and there is no way


213
0:12:36,447 --> 0:12:38,767
he'll walk in with a big smile.


214
0:12:38,767 --> 0:12:48,887
What do you say, sports fans?
lt's a great day!


215
0:12:48,887 --> 0:12:51,687
Elliot, Todd has
something to say to you.


216
0:12:51,687 --> 0:12:53,287
Todd?


217
0:12:53,287 --> 0:12:56,767
Turk never told me
you were his project geek.


218
0:12:56,767 --> 0:13:1,447
- And?
- You look really hot eating that egg.


219
0:13:1,447 --> 0:13:4,647
l'm sorry.


220
0:13:4,647 --> 0:13:9,847
- OK? Are we?
- No.


221
0:13:9,847 --> 0:13:12,127
Look at me and tell me l'm not a geek.


222
0:13:12,127 --> 0:13:20,527
- You still got that rubber thingy on.
- Eggs can be extremely slippery.


223
0:13:20,527 --> 0:13:22,607
You scared the hell outta me.


224
0:13:22,607 --> 0:13:24,687
l'm sorry. That always happens.


225
0:13:24,687 --> 0:13:27,207
No one ever expects
me to be anywhere.


226
0:13:27,207 --> 0:13:30,647
Aw, Ted.


227
0:13:30,647 --> 0:13:32,887
She knows your name.


228
0:13:32,887 --> 0:13:37,207
So, l found your coma patient's
relative you were looking for.


229
0:13:37,207 --> 0:13:40,687
Thank you!
Thank you so much.


230
0:13:40,687 --> 0:13:42,287
Don't let go.


231
0:13:42,287 --> 0:13:44,767
- What?
- Nothing.


232
0:13:44,767 --> 0:13:48,807
l'll acknowledge there
have been occasions during my tenure...


233
0:13:48,807 --> 0:13:50,887
What do you think you're doing?


234
0:13:50,887 --> 0:13:54,687
Apologising to Franklyn
for breaking his favourite microscope.


235
0:13:54,687 --> 0:13:58,367
You can't cry on my shoulder
then pretend nothing happened.


236
0:13:58,367 --> 0:14:1,687
All right. First of all,
Franklyn, there was no crying.


237
0:14:1,687 --> 0:14:3,287
Say it.


238
0:14:3,287 --> 0:14:5,127
- No crying.
- Good boy.


239
0:14:5,127 --> 0:14:7,567
And you should give some thought


240
0:14:7,567 --> 0:14:10,87
to purchasing some
non-bunching panties.


241
0:14:10,87 --> 0:14:12,87
They give you the extra support


242
0:14:12,87 --> 0:14:15,607
while protecting against those lines
underneath your scrubs.


243
0:14:15,607 --> 0:14:18,487
- l get it. l'm a girl.
- Franklyn, you heard it. Say it.


244
0:14:18,487 --> 0:14:20,487
- He's a girl.
- Good boy.


245
0:14:20,487 --> 0:14:23,887
You can't play with people's
emotions cos you feel like it.


246
0:14:23,887 --> 0:14:26,927
OK, newbie, l'm now going
to give you an opportunity


247
0:14:26,927 --> 0:14:29,807
to get out of here
before l grab you by your ankles


248
0:14:29,807 --> 0:14:32,207
and redecorate Franklyn's lab.


249
0:14:32,207 --> 0:14:36,127
Please go.


250
0:14:36,127 --> 0:14:38,607
We're back.
The clique is back together!


251
0:14:38,607 --> 0:14:42,367
That is what
l'm talkin' about. Shall we?


252
0:14:42,367 --> 0:14:53,7
Let's do this.


253
0:14:53,7 --> 0:14:55,487
Let's get back to work.


254
0:14:55,487 --> 0:14:58,87
But it's gonna be different this time.


255
0:14:58,87 --> 0:15:2,47
lf we take a systematic approach,
we'll maximise our efficiency.


256
0:15:2,47 --> 0:15:4,47
l rented <i>Red Dawn,</i>


257
0:15:4,47 --> 0:15:5,887
Wolverines!


258
0:15:5,887 --> 0:15:8,927
Dr Kelso, this is Matthew Rice.


259
0:15:8,927 --> 0:15:11,967
He's the proxy
for his uncle's living will.


260
0:15:11,967 --> 0:15:13,927
What a happy coincidence,


261
0:15:13,927 --> 0:15:17,287
you showing up
out of the clear blue sky.


262
0:15:17,287 --> 0:15:19,447
- Oh, God.
- You're OK.


263
0:15:19,447 --> 0:15:22,767
So, exactly how much is my uncle
leaving me? Can l ask that?


264
0:15:22,767 --> 0:15:25,87
This isn't about his assets.


265
0:15:25,87 --> 0:15:28,7
This is about executing
his last living requests.


266
0:15:28,7 --> 0:15:30,487
So no money at all?


267
0:15:30,487 --> 0:15:32,807
Not a dime, kiddo.


268
0:15:32,807 --> 0:15:35,527
l can't tell you how glad we are


269
0:15:35,527 --> 0:15:37,887
to put all this tomfoolery to rest.


270
0:15:37,887 --> 0:15:44,447
Once and for all.
Cup of coffee, sport?


271
0:15:44,447 --> 0:15:48,167
What happened? l blacked out.


272
0:15:48,167 --> 0:15:51,847
When you rolled out of bed this morning,
did you say to yourself,


273
0:15:51,847 --> 0:15:56,447
''Hey! l think today would be
a terrific day to commit hari-kari''?


274
0:15:56,447 --> 0:15:58,527
That's what you're doing.


275
0:15:58,527 --> 0:16:1,967
You don't deal with problems
the way emotionally healthy people do.


276
0:16:1,967 --> 0:16:4,367
Well, hold on
a second there, Rainbow.


277
0:16:4,367 --> 0:16:7,767
This just off the news wire:
You're not licensed to comment


278
0:16:7,767 --> 0:16:10,47
on how people deal with their emotions.


279
0:16:10,47 --> 0:16:13,727
- l beg to differ.
- Well, at least l let mine go. You?


280
0:16:13,727 --> 0:16:16,287
lf you ever were able to actually


281
0:16:16,287 --> 0:16:19,527
release all the tensions
that are bottled up inside of you,


282
0:16:19,527 --> 0:16:26,87
what would that look like?
How would that go?


283
0:16:26,87 --> 0:16:29,47
How you like me now, bitch?


284
0:16:29,47 --> 0:16:34,127
Maybe l just don't
have anything bottled up.


285
0:16:34,127 --> 0:16:37,527
What happened to that teacher
you were prattling on about?


286
0:16:37,527 --> 0:16:40,727
- Passed away.
- Croaksville. That's what l thought.


287
0:16:40,727 --> 0:16:43,967
What did you do
when you found out that he'd died?


288
0:16:43,967 --> 0:16:47,407
- l made a joke.
- l sure hope it was a good one.


289
0:16:47,407 --> 0:16:50,567
Here's the inside scoop.
Life's hard enough,


290
0:16:50,567 --> 0:16:53,647
and there's no way
you can survive in a dump like this


291
0:16:53,647 --> 0:16:56,527
unless you find a way
to get your emotions out.


292
0:16:56,527 --> 0:16:58,207
Fact.


293
0:16:58,207 --> 0:17:5,47
Well, l let my emotions out!
l'll show you some of this!


294
0:17:5,47 --> 0:17:9,647
Franklyn, l am so sorry.


295
0:17:9,647 --> 0:17:12,87
Wanna wear my stethoscope?


296
0:17:12,87 --> 0:17:16,167
The cool thing about this movie
is that this could really happen.


297
0:17:16,167 --> 0:17:19,567
The Russians invading,
or C Thomas Howell being a tough guy?


298
0:17:19,567 --> 0:17:23,727
Both.


299
0:17:23,727 --> 0:17:27,767
Wolverines.
Why is she always here?


300
0:17:27,767 --> 0:17:30,287
We're working on my study.


301
0:17:30,287 --> 0:17:33,167
Every time l come here
l'm gonna see him.


302
0:17:33,167 --> 0:17:35,927
Just get someone else
to do this project with you.


303
0:17:35,927 --> 0:17:38,647
Maybe the reason
why l asked you to work with me


304
0:17:38,647 --> 0:17:41,407
is because it would
force you to see each other.


305
0:17:41,407 --> 0:17:43,887
l don't want to get
back together with him.


306
0:17:43,887 --> 0:17:47,487
l'm not saying that.
You made a terrible couple.


307
0:17:47,487 --> 0:17:49,727
lt's just that...
l like you. You know?


308
0:17:49,727 --> 0:17:51,967
l think you're a cool person.


309
0:17:51,967 --> 0:17:54,527
lt doesn't matter about me and JD.


310
0:17:54,527 --> 0:17:57,567
- You and l can still hang out.
- No.


311
0:17:57,567 --> 0:18:0,327
lt can't be that way,
and you know it.


312
0:18:0,327 --> 0:18:2,607
Cos that's my best friend.


313
0:18:2,607 --> 0:18:11,927
So, either you can try and fix it, or...


314
0:18:11,927 --> 0:18:14,327
- This sucks.
- Yeah.


315
0:18:14,327 --> 0:18:17,287
<i>And baby we'll be</i>


316
0:18:17,287 --> 0:18:20,607
<i>At the drive-in</i>


317
0:18:20,607 --> 0:18:24,607
<i>In the old man's Ford</i>


318
0:18:24,607 --> 0:18:29,7
<i>Behind the bushes</i>


319
0:18:29,7 --> 0:18:34,687
<i>Till I'm screaming for more</i>


320
0:18:34,687 --> 0:18:38,687
<i>Down the basement</i>


321
0:18:38,687 --> 0:18:42,687
<i>Lock the cellar door</i>


322
0:18:42,687 --> 0:18:46,87
<i>And baby</i>


323
0:18:46,87 --> 0:18:50,447
<i>Talk dirty to</i>


324
0:18:50,447 --> 0:18:54,807
<i>Me</i>


325
0:18:54,807 --> 0:18:57,167
- l love you.
- What?


326
0:18:57,167 --> 0:19:0,7
<i>Know that we'll be</i>


327
0:19:0,7 --> 0:19:6,447
<i>At the drive-in,,,</i>


328
0:19:6,447 --> 0:19:8,847
What are you doing?


329
0:19:8,847 --> 0:19:12,527
This is a recommendation letter
from a high school teacher of mine.


330
0:19:12,527 --> 0:19:14,807
He's actually


331
0:19:14,807 --> 0:19:17,807
the reason l got into medicine.


332
0:19:17,807 --> 0:19:20,447
And he died last week.


333
0:19:20,447 --> 0:19:22,807
l'm so sorry, JD.


334
0:19:22,807 --> 0:19:29,927
l really am.


335
0:19:29,927 --> 0:19:32,127
Do you wanna be alone?


336
0:19:32,127 --> 0:19:33,887
No.


337
0:19:33,887 --> 0:19:37,487
You wanna cry a little?


338
0:19:37,487 --> 0:19:41,927
No.


339
0:19:41,927 --> 0:19:51,247
Wanna go throw stuff off the roof
like Letterman used to do?


340
0:19:51,247 --> 0:19:54,487
You see, it's the pudding
that splatters the best,


341
0:19:54,487 --> 0:19:59,607
because it's the pudding, and therefore
l say let the pudding pop fall!


342
0:19:59,607 --> 0:20:2,527
- Who is that? Arsenio?
- No.


343
0:20:2,527 --> 0:20:5,7
<i>Everyone has their own way of releasing</i>


344
0:20:5,7 --> 0:20:7,527
<i>the stuff that gets</i>
<i>bottled up inside them,</i>


345
0:20:7,527 --> 0:20:10,247
<i>It just took a good friend</i>
<i>to help me find mine,</i>


346
0:20:10,247 --> 0:20:12,527
Dr Dorian,
we're ready for the finale.


347
0:20:12,527 --> 0:20:14,887
Thank you, Dr Reid.


348
0:20:14,887 --> 0:20:16,807
OK, guys.


349
0:20:16,807 --> 0:20:27,967
One, two, three.


350
0:20:27,967 --> 0:20:30,287
<i>It felt really good,</i>


351
0:20:30,287 --> 0:20:42,7
Player.


352
0:20:42,7 --> 0:22:42,7
The horror.
