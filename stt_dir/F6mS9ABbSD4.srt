1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,374



2
0:0:4,374 --> 0:0:8,0
BILLY VALDES: I don't skate
as much as I did before.


3
0:0:8,0 --> 0:0:9,91
That's, I think, a standard.


4
0:0:9,91 --> 0:0:13,26
You grow up, you have more
responsibilities.


5
0:0:13,26 --> 0:0:15,15
I have a child now,
I'm married.


6
0:0:15,15 --> 0:0:16,4
You have bills--


7
0:0:16,4 --> 0:0:17,81
back then, I didn't
have bills.


8
0:0:17,81 --> 0:0:23,74
You wake up, you don't
even have a thought.


9
0:0:23,74 --> 0:0:24,46
Well, I didn't.


10
0:0:24,46 --> 0:0:26,28
It's like boom, wake
up, do whatevs.


11
0:0:26,28 --> 0:0:28,74
Go skate, go do whatever.


12
0:0:28,74 --> 0:0:31,33
Early on, Menace days, it was
hanging out in my pad really,


13
0:0:31,33 --> 0:0:31,75
to tell you the truth.


14
0:0:31,75 --> 0:0:34,49
Actually, my chick's
pad, now my wife.


15
0:0:34,49 --> 0:0:35,89
GINO IANNUCCI: I remember
a lot of days


16
0:0:35,89 --> 0:0:37,16
being at Billy's house.


17
0:0:37,16 --> 0:0:38,715
Everyone would just kind of meet
there at night and hang


18
0:0:38,715 --> 0:0:40,93
out and smoke or drink
or whatever.


19
0:0:40,93 --> 0:0:43,17
He was like the show, you
know what I mean?


20
0:0:43,17 --> 0:0:46,1
Anytime Billy was around,
whether he was at our house or


21
0:0:46,1 --> 0:0:47,81
if it was at a spot, everyone
was around.


22
0:0:47,81 --> 0:0:51,57
He was in the middle and he was
just like on 10 always.


23
0:0:51,57 --> 0:0:54,47
And it seemed like he wasn't
an everyday type of skater.


24
0:0:54,47 --> 0:0:56,57
But when he got on his board,
he'd bang out something sick.


25
0:0:56,57 --> 0:0:59,12
So that's what was
dope about him.


26
0:0:59,12 --> 0:1:0,96
-Where are you from?


27
0:1:0,96 --> 0:1:5,19
BILLY VALDES: Born in Chicago,
but raised in Los Angeles.


28
0:1:5,19 --> 0:1:9,19
So I consider myself a Los
Angelino, I guess.


29
0:1:9,19 --> 0:1:11,26
-Do you remember the first time
hearing about or seeing


30
0:1:11,26 --> 0:1:12,56
any pro skaters?


31
0:1:12,56 --> 0:1:17,25
BILLY VALDES: One of my friend's
sisters was dating


32
0:1:17,25 --> 0:1:21,58
some Christian rock dude, long
hair, like Stryper--


33
0:1:21,58 --> 0:1:23,19
bandannas around.


34
0:1:23,19 --> 0:1:27,2
And he's skating and
he gave my friend


35
0:1:27,2 --> 0:1:29,33
a Ray "Bones" Rodriguez.


36
0:1:29,33 --> 0:1:33,37
Then I think first video I saw
was "Future Primitive." Then


37
0:1:33,37 --> 0:1:34,97
you get psyched, you're like
dude, I want to be a Bones


38
0:1:34,97 --> 0:1:36,88
Brigade member.


39
0:1:36,88 --> 0:1:40,32
-So how did you end
up becoming one?


40
0:1:40,32 --> 0:1:42,62
BILLY VALDES: Shoot,
I don't know.


41
0:1:42,62 --> 0:1:45,63
Right place, right
time, I guess.


42
0:1:45,63 --> 0:1:47,62
A lot of my friends already
kind of skated for it.


43
0:1:47,62 --> 0:1:50,19
RUDY JOHNSON: There would be
crews of little skate groups


44
0:1:50,19 --> 0:1:53,1
and they would skate
from spot to spot.


45
0:1:53,1 --> 0:1:56,13
And we'd meet up sometimes and
be like oh hey, what's up?


46
0:1:56,13 --> 0:2:0,28
And Billy, man, he
was skating rad.


47
0:2:0,28 --> 0:2:3,98
He was part of Paolo's little
crew of friends.


48
0:2:3,98 --> 0:2:4,73
-Tell me about Paolo Diaz.


49
0:2:4,73 --> 0:2:8,22
BILLY VALDES: The local
ripper, always.


50
0:2:8,22 --> 0:2:9,3
We met in high school.


51
0:2:9,3 --> 0:2:11,9
He came up to me and asked me
if I wanted to bail from


52
0:2:11,9 --> 0:2:17,43
school and go hang out and do
stuff that we're not supposed


53
0:2:17,43 --> 0:2:18,38
to be doing.


54
0:2:18,38 --> 0:2:21,86
-So you skated for Paolo at
the same as him later?


55
0:2:21,86 --> 0:2:24,2
BILLY VALDES: Yeah, we were
on there at the same time.


56
0:2:24,2 --> 0:2:26,753
And he kind of helped
with all that, too.


57
0:2:26,753 --> 0:2:30,81
He kind of pushed for me
and Joey to get on.


58
0:2:30,81 --> 0:2:33,42
He wanted us to tag along,
we tagged along.


59
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:36,67
Stacy happened to be at Los
Feliz one day and he kind of


60
0:2:36,67 --> 0:2:40,47
liked the way a few of us
skated-- like Joey, this kid


61
0:2:40,47 --> 0:2:43,3
Ruben Prieto and me.


62
0:2:43,3 --> 0:2:45,45
We filmed the part after that,
it never got released.


63
0:2:45,45 --> 0:2:51,8
And Paolo was filming
his first solo part.


64
0:2:51,8 --> 0:2:53,81
And everyone knows him
as Paolo Diaz.


65
0:2:53,81 --> 0:2:57,6
Back in the day, everyone
called him Pablo Diaz.


66
0:2:57,6 --> 0:2:58,31
Everyone's like, dude,
you heard of this


67
0:2:58,31 --> 0:3:0,2
guy named Pablo Diaz?


68
0:3:0,2 --> 0:3:2,52
Oh, he ollied the six,
fucking lost a tooth.


69
0:3:2,52 --> 0:3:4,31
JOEY SURIEL: Dude was
like an urban legend


70
0:3:4,31 --> 0:3:6,57
in the 'hood, bro.


71
0:3:6,57 --> 0:3:7,73
And we used to call him Pablo.


72
0:3:7,73 --> 0:3:10,7
We didn't know it was Paolo.


73
0:3:10,7 --> 0:3:13,79
So back in the day, we would
just hear these little stories


74
0:3:13,79 --> 0:3:15,42
about this guy named
Pablo Diaz.


75
0:3:15,42 --> 0:3:16,67
FABIAN ALOMAR: What he did and
things and tricks he's done.


76
0:3:16,67 --> 0:3:18,197
JOEY SURIEL: We'd got to
a spot and be like


77
0:3:18,197 --> 0:3:19,7
yeah, Pablo Diaz man.


78
0:3:19,7 --> 0:3:20,45
He did this there, that there.


79
0:3:20,45 --> 0:3:22,106
FABIAN ALOMAR: Back in the '80s,
there was all kinds of


80
0:3:22,106 --> 0:3:24,3
crews and cliques of
skateboarding cliques.


81
0:3:24,3 --> 0:3:27,13
And we used to be in Mutants.


82
0:3:27,13 --> 0:3:28,98
So we used to hang out with
Paolo, because was like the


83
0:3:28,98 --> 0:3:30,62
main dude in Mutants.


84
0:3:30,62 --> 0:3:32,16
Paolo was sick.


85
0:3:32,16 --> 0:3:34,205
And there was like a couple
Korean dudes.


86
0:3:34,205 --> 0:3:35,47
What's his name, Chang?


87
0:3:35,47 --> 0:3:35,725
Sang?


88
0:3:35,725 --> 0:3:36,26
JOEY SURIEL: Sang.


89
0:3:36,26 --> 0:3:38,99
FABIAN ALOMAR: And they used to
all hang up right here at


90
0:3:38,99 --> 0:3:40,965
this school and another school
called Dayton Heights, it


91
0:3:40,965 --> 0:3:42,1
right down the street.


92
0:3:42,1 --> 0:3:43,3
-And Paolo's from here?


93
0:3:43,3 --> 0:3:46,67
FABIAN ALOMAR: Yeah, Paolo's a
native of all this right here,


94
0:3:46,67 --> 0:3:47,76
just like us.


95
0:3:47,76 --> 0:3:49,48
Paolo and Billy Valdez,
just sick.


96
0:3:49,48 --> 0:3:52,17
JOEY SURIEL: I ain't gonna lie
man, we used to always trip


97
0:3:52,17 --> 0:3:52,61
out on him.


98
0:3:52,61 --> 0:3:55,13
Because he would be on the Jimi
Hendrix, he'd be on the


99
0:3:55,13 --> 0:3:57,76
total opposite side
of the spectrum.


100
0:3:57,76 --> 0:4:0,99
We were always into the
hip-hop, rap music.


101
0:4:0,99 --> 0:4:2,54
-You [INAUDIBLE] dress like
a skater back then?


102
0:4:2,54 --> 0:4:5,17
FABIAN ALOMAR: No, we used
to wear Dickies.


103
0:4:5,17 --> 0:4:7,2
-Was that an influence
from skating?


104
0:4:7,2 --> 0:4:9,85
JOEY SURIEL: No,
that was just--


105
0:4:9,85 --> 0:4:9,56
FABIAN ALOMAR: Bad.


106
0:4:9,56 --> 0:4:10,98
JOEY SURIEL: Gang
influence, man.


107
0:4:10,98 --> 0:4:12,87
It wasn't that we were trying
to bang or nothing.


108
0:4:12,87 --> 0:4:13,83
It was something normal.


109
0:4:13,83 --> 0:4:15,658
STEVEN CALES: Hey, I used to
come to where I'm from like


110
0:4:15,658 --> 0:4:16,959
the way I look from New York.


111
0:4:16,959 --> 0:4:18,866
And his sister used
to count on me.


112
0:4:18,866 --> 0:4:20,88
And meanwhile I'm counting on
her, the way she looked.


113
0:4:20,88 --> 0:4:22,493
JOEY SURIEL: Steven used
to make fun of us.


114
0:4:22,493 --> 0:4:24,26
Like, why are you
wearing that?


115
0:4:24,26 --> 0:4:25,37
Because he didn't understand.


116
0:4:25,37 --> 0:4:27,33
FABIAN ALOMAR: And we used to
make fun of him, because he


117
0:4:27,33 --> 0:4:31,11
came over here with all this
shiny, dress like slick Rick.


118
0:4:31,11 --> 0:4:34,8
And we were like what's
wrong with this dude?


119
0:4:34,8 --> 0:4:35,82
Big chain, gold teeth.


120
0:4:35,82 --> 0:4:38,12
So we had baggy clothes
and white t-shirts.


121
0:4:38,12 --> 0:4:41,4
JOEY SURIEL: But it was cool,
because when he came then we


122
0:4:41,4 --> 0:4:43,76
were exposed to his culture.


123
0:4:43,76 --> 0:4:46,2
Where he came from,
where he grew up


124
0:4:46,2 --> 0:4:47,47
seeing, and vice versa.


125
0:4:47,47 --> 0:4:49,41
And that was cool, and
then we connected.


126
0:4:49,41 --> 0:4:50,43
-Were you guys trying
to do something


127
0:4:50,43 --> 0:4:51,555
different, like Menace?


128
0:4:51,555 --> 0:4:52,67
FABIAN ALOMAR: We were
just being us.


129
0:4:52,67 --> 0:4:54,9
JOEY SURIEL: Yeah, man.


130
0:4:54,9 --> 0:4:57,67
FABIAN ALOMAR: I mean, to tell
you the truth, I wanted to


131
0:4:57,67 --> 0:5:3,57
just fit in in skateboarding,
but I didn't know how it was


132
0:5:3,57 --> 0:5:4,5
going to be.


133
0:5:4,5 --> 0:5:7,19
I just knew it was a dope
company because it was coming


134
0:5:7,19 --> 0:5:10,97
out of World, and Kareem
had already a big name.


135
0:5:10,97 --> 0:5:15,878
But I think that we were
just being us, man.


136
0:5:15,878 --> 0:5:16,852
-That's the bomb!


137
0:5:16,852 --> 0:5:18,4
-These guys love this
shit right here.


138
0:5:18,4 --> 0:5:19,54
-That's the bomb, OK.


139
0:5:19,54 --> 0:5:21,94
Where we at?


140
0:5:21,94 --> 0:5:22,37
-Midtown.


141
0:5:22,37 --> 0:5:23,62
-NYC midtown brothers.


142
0:5:23,62 --> 0:5:26,564



143
0:5:26,564 --> 0:5:29,6
STEVIE WILLIAMS: I loved
everything about Menace.


144
0:5:29,6 --> 0:5:30,1
Everything about it.


145
0:5:30,1 --> 0:5:37,27
The graphics, the team,
the swag, homies--


146
0:5:37,27 --> 0:5:38,885
it was a good thing.


147
0:5:38,885 --> 0:5:41,38
BILLY VALDES: Actually from day
one, too, I'm going to say


148
0:5:41,38 --> 0:5:48,305
that the name Menace I wasn't
psyched on, but it grew on me.


149
0:5:48,305 --> 0:5:49,32
Because I thought it
was like what?


150
0:5:49,32 --> 0:5:51,338
Like fucking "Menace II
Society?" You know what I


151
0:5:51,338 --> 0:5:52,95
mean, I was thinking
of the movie.


152
0:5:52,95 --> 0:5:54,47
But then it grew on me.


153
0:5:54,47 --> 0:5:57,0
I think the name's
fucking dope.


154
0:5:57,0 --> 0:5:59,97
He knew that at the time we
were standing a little bit


155
0:5:59,97 --> 0:6:1,9
different and just representing
ourselves a


156
0:6:1,9 --> 0:6:3,38
little bit different
than most kids.


157
0:6:3,38 --> 0:6:6,77



158
0:6:6,77 --> 0:6:8,15
-All y'all half-assed
niggahs with your


159
0:6:8,15 --> 0:6:10,803
half-assed shit, eat a dick.


160
0:6:10,803 --> 0:6:13,12
BILLY VALDES: I worked for
Extra Large back in those


161
0:6:13,12 --> 0:6:14,67
days, at the shop.


162
0:6:14,67 --> 0:6:20,28
And so we had a good connection
with music, like


163
0:6:20,28 --> 0:6:22,41
rap, because Beastie
Boys were involved.


164
0:6:22,41 --> 0:6:27,91
So like before Cypress Hill came
out, I had Cypress Hills


165
0:6:27,91 --> 0:6:30,408
tape, t-shirt, yadda, yadda.


166
0:6:30,408 --> 0:6:32,2
-Oh shit, Wu-Tang stickers.


167
0:6:32,2 --> 0:6:34,8
BILLY VALDES: We were
all listening to


168
0:6:34,8 --> 0:6:36,18
Wu-Tang, too, at the time.


169
0:6:36,18 --> 0:6:39,99
Had a lot to influence in the
original first set of series,


170
0:6:39,99 --> 0:6:41,4
I should say.


171
0:6:41,4 --> 0:6:45,96
I mean, we all sat down
together, but I had a


172
0:6:45,96 --> 0:6:50,33
sketchbook like the Enter
the Pu-Tang board.


173
0:6:50,33 --> 0:6:51,33
I'd sketched that damn thing.


174
0:6:51,33 --> 0:6:54,52
Oh yeah, this should be like
a team board, boom.


175
0:6:54,52 --> 0:6:55,91
But Shiloh came up
with the title.


176
0:6:55,91 --> 0:6:58,915
Because at first I left
that blank because I


177
0:6:58,915 --> 0:7:0,2
was like enter what?


178
0:7:0,2 --> 0:7:1,66
-What was the ad "Enter
the Pu-Tang?"


179
0:7:1,66 --> 0:7:2,5
There was like a photo?


180
0:7:2,5 --> 0:7:3,84
BILLY VALDES: That was
Kareem's idea.


181
0:7:3,84 --> 0:7:8,21
Like, dude, let's shoot like
a Wu-Tang style ad.


182
0:7:8,21 --> 0:7:10,5
And that's kind of what we're
doing at the time.


183
0:7:10,5 --> 0:7:11,88
So we're like, let's do
something that fully


184
0:7:11,88 --> 0:7:12,67
represents us.


185
0:7:12,67 --> 0:7:15,86
And boom, Caustic shows
up with this model.


186
0:7:15,86 --> 0:7:20,72
And so our first thing is, is
she going to get naked?


187
0:7:20,72 --> 0:7:24,56
And then she's like
yeah, I'll do it.


188
0:7:24,56 --> 0:7:27,745
And so we all look at each
other, dope, that's rad, she's


189
0:7:27,745 --> 0:7:29,16
going to get naked.


190
0:7:29,16 --> 0:7:32,37
And next thing you know, Caustic
posed a cockblock move


191
0:7:32,37 --> 0:7:33,875
and acted like it was
his girlfriend.


192
0:7:33,875 --> 0:7:39,8
He was like no, no,
no, only topless.


193
0:7:39,8 --> 0:7:41,796
It was a good move, because
it would have been


194
0:7:41,796 --> 0:7:42,675
too raunchy, I guess.


195
0:7:42,675 --> 0:7:45,35
LEE SMITH: It's funny, the image
that people all over the


196
0:7:45,35 --> 0:7:50,37
world had of Menace is like OK,
we're a skate company of


197
0:7:50,37 --> 0:7:52,14
mostly black and
Latino skaters.


198
0:7:52,14 --> 0:7:55,65
And our image was hip-hop
and all this shit.


199
0:7:55,65 --> 0:8:0,41
But people really thought we
were gangsters or some shit.


200
0:8:0,41 --> 0:8:2,66
People have come up to me and
said the craziest stuff.


201
0:8:2,66 --> 0:8:4,98
Especially in Europe, because
they were just like whoa,


202
0:8:4,98 --> 0:8:8,7
these dudes are just beating
people up at the skate spot


203
0:8:8,7 --> 0:8:9,165
and getting crazy.


204
0:8:9,165 --> 0:8:12,37
FABIAN ALOMAR: There was
probably like two or three


205
0:8:12,37 --> 0:8:15,48
occasions where I went and I
ended up getting into a fight


206
0:8:15,48 --> 0:8:16,66
with somebody out in Europe.


207
0:8:16,66 --> 0:8:20,51
GUY MARIANO: We're all in a bar
in Europe, and there was


208
0:8:20,51 --> 0:8:21,95
like a wedding reception
going on.


209
0:8:21,95 --> 0:8:25,42
And somehow there was like this
bouquet of flowers, it


210
0:8:25,42 --> 0:8:26,35
was just sitting there.


211
0:8:26,35 --> 0:8:30,21
And I remember I picked it up
and I grabbed it and threw it


212
0:8:30,21 --> 0:8:31,185
into a group of skaters.


213
0:8:31,185 --> 0:8:33,98
And they all jumped and kind
of shredded it apart.


214
0:8:33,98 --> 0:8:36,82
But it was actually from the
real wedding or whatever.


215
0:8:36,82 --> 0:8:39,45
And this gnarly European
dude came up and


216
0:8:39,45 --> 0:8:40,46
wanted to fuck me up.


217
0:8:40,46 --> 0:8:42,47
And they're like, hey dude, you
should go up to your room,


218
0:8:42,47 --> 0:8:44,25
this dude's pretty pissed.


219
0:8:44,25 --> 0:8:47,38
And I went up to the room, it
was me, Fabian and the girl


220
0:8:47,38 --> 0:8:48,61
Fabian was messing with.


221
0:8:48,61 --> 0:8:53,81
And this girl had 666 tattooed
right above her vagina.


222
0:8:53,81 --> 0:8:55,31
Pretty crazy girl.


223
0:8:55,31 --> 0:8:57,96
And I open up the door
and it was the dude.


224
0:8:57,96 --> 0:9:1,57
And he clocked me right in the
face and Fabian ended up


225
0:9:1,57 --> 0:9:2,945
beating his ass.


226
0:9:2,945 --> 0:9:5,68
LEE SMITH: So he beat up
the father of bride


227
0:9:5,68 --> 0:9:8,94
in our hotel room.


228
0:9:8,94 --> 0:9:11,19
ERIC PUPECKI: I don't know,
I can't get into that.


229
0:9:11,19 --> 0:9:14,61
But I know he liked to
get us in trouble.


230
0:9:14,61 --> 0:9:15,82
But he was crazy, too.


231
0:9:15,82 --> 0:9:19,35
But I guess I was, too,
so it was no big deal,


232
0:9:19,35 --> 0:9:20,49
it's all a good time.


233
0:9:20,49 --> 0:9:22,71
You know, everyone would come
around and they'd want to talk


234
0:9:22,71 --> 0:9:24,4
and hang out.


235
0:9:24,4 --> 0:9:27,53
All the hip-hop kids and the
hip-hop skater guys.


236
0:9:27,53 --> 0:9:29,13
It'd be like uniforms.


237
0:9:29,13 --> 0:9:33,2
They'd walk up in a Menace
uniform, it was ridiculous.


238
0:9:33,2 --> 0:9:34,88
We went to Germany one
time, the whole


239
0:9:34,88 --> 0:9:36,6
stadium was Menace uniforms.


240
0:9:36,6 --> 0:9:39,76
There was like Joey's and
Eric's and Fabian's--


241
0:9:39,76 --> 0:9:40,89
dudes trying to look like us.


242
0:9:40,89 --> 0:9:41,55
It was crazy.


243
0:9:41,55 --> 0:9:44,335
And we weren't even doing
nothing in the contest.


244
0:9:44,335 --> 0:9:46,74
We weren't going to win.


245
0:9:46,74 --> 0:9:49,44
We got to do everything, we'd go
to great hotels, we'd have


246
0:9:49,44 --> 0:9:54,69
a great time, we'd have stacks
of [INAUDIBLE] and weed.


247
0:9:54,69 --> 0:9:56,48
We had skateboards galore.


248
0:9:56,48 --> 0:10:1,16
We got to go on all the A+
tours, so we'd go to Germany,


249
0:10:1,16 --> 0:10:3,89
we'd go to Switzerland,
Italy, everywhere--


250
0:10:3,89 --> 0:10:5,42
can't beat that.


251
0:10:5,42 --> 0:10:10,44
-I remember they used to tell me
yeah well, you're not going


252
0:10:10,44 --> 0:10:13,262
to make it in skateboarding.


253
0:10:13,262 --> 0:10:14,7
I'd be like really?


254
0:10:14,7 --> 0:10:15,89
OK, we'll see about that.


255
0:10:15,89 --> 0:10:23,2
We'd go on tour and the
overwhelming presence of


256
0:10:23,2 --> 0:10:25,76
Menace product that
was out there.


257
0:10:25,76 --> 0:10:30,26
Like denim and jackets and
boards and all these different


258
0:10:30,26 --> 0:10:32,1
things, I remember
it was out there.


259
0:10:32,1 --> 0:10:37,7
And if I had to gauge based on
what I saw, it was definitely


260
0:10:37,7 --> 0:10:38,135
successful, financially.


261
0:10:38,135 --> 0:10:42,11
LEE SMITH: Looking back on it,
you never think this is going


262
0:10:42,11 --> 0:10:44,46
to end one day.


263
0:10:44,46 --> 0:10:47,37
You're like I skate for Menace,
we're the shit.


264
0:10:47,37 --> 0:10:48,52
We don't even need to skate.


265
0:10:48,52 --> 0:10:51,89
We've got the best image.


266
0:10:51,89 --> 0:10:56,61
Kareem is the man and he's
basically telling me we're


267
0:10:56,61 --> 0:10:59,67
going to be chilling for life
and you believe that shit, yo.


268
0:10:59,67 --> 0:11:1,2
You know what I mean?


269
0:11:1,2 --> 0:11:4,25



270
0:11:4,25 --> 0:11:6,7
I'm hanging out with you, you're
telling me that we're


271
0:11:6,7 --> 0:11:6,97
straight, we're good.


272
0:11:6,97 --> 0:11:9,51
I see the way you're living,
you got a pocketful


273
0:11:9,51 --> 0:11:10,8
of money every day.


274
0:11:10,8 --> 0:11:12,2
And I believe that shit.


275
0:11:12,2 --> 0:11:15,92
BILLY VALDES: Fishy
from day one.


276
0:11:15,92 --> 0:11:20,35
Biggest check you ever get on
your board releases, boom,


277
0:11:20,35 --> 0:11:21,72
bam, big check.


278
0:11:21,72 --> 0:11:23,28
Wow, dude, I made this much!


279
0:11:23,28 --> 0:11:24,65
Like bam!


280
0:11:24,65 --> 0:11:27,61
And then it goes like whoa.


281
0:11:27,61 --> 0:11:29,205
Then it stays at a steady--


282
0:11:29,205 --> 0:11:32,6



283
0:11:32,6 --> 0:11:34,5
checks just started
getting smaller.


284
0:11:34,5 --> 0:11:37,44
It was like hint hint.


285
0:11:37,44 --> 0:11:40,52
And not that boards weren't
selling, it's just fucking


286
0:11:40,52 --> 0:11:41,77
cutting the checks.


287
0:11:41,77 --> 0:11:44,7



288
0:11:44,7 --> 0:11:46,88
I don't know where the other
money went, but who knows.


289
0:11:46,88 --> 0:11:49,58
ERIC PUPECKI: When
did we get these?


290
0:11:49,58 --> 0:11:51,27
So this was after Menace,
obviously--


291
0:11:51,27 --> 0:11:51,87
MNC.


292
0:11:51,87 --> 0:11:54,68
So this must have been when we
were starting MNC when we had


293
0:11:54,68 --> 0:11:56,74
to change the name the
first time, I guess.


294
0:11:56,74 --> 0:11:58,725
JOEY SURIEL: That was
a huge blow, bro.


295
0:11:58,725 --> 0:12:1,5
I'll be honest with you,
that was a huge blow.


296
0:12:1,5 --> 0:12:4,4
We'd be on tour, and the
kids would still be


297
0:12:4,4 --> 0:12:5,44
referring to Menace.


298
0:12:5,44 --> 0:12:8,63
But we'd be wearing the All City
shirt and they'd be like


299
0:12:8,63 --> 0:12:10,312
oh, what's All City?


300
0:12:10,312 --> 0:12:11,704
-Menace [INAUDIBLE]


301
0:12:11,704 --> 0:12:13,89
JOEY SURIEL: The trademark
lawyers fought it out, and


302
0:12:13,89 --> 0:12:19,5
they said that MNC was still
not enough of a change.


303
0:12:19,5 --> 0:12:22,22
And that's when we had to
do the All City thing.


304
0:12:22,22 --> 0:12:25,11
And then as soon as we maybe
thought we were getting a


305
0:12:25,11 --> 0:12:29,39
little bit of momentum,
it came again.


306
0:12:29,39 --> 0:12:31,65
And I guess All City was owned
by Russell Simmons.


307
0:12:31,65 --> 0:12:32,78
FABIAN ALOMAR: Fat farm, man.


308
0:12:32,78 --> 0:12:34,48
JOEY SURIEL: But it was
just a big old thing.


309
0:12:34,48 --> 0:12:37,31
And then finally, when Kareem
knocked down City Stars.


310
0:12:37,31 --> 0:12:38,525
-So it had four names?


311
0:12:38,525 --> 0:12:39,81
JOEY SURIEL: Three.


312
0:12:39,81 --> 0:12:40,87
-Well. there's Menace, MNC--


313
0:12:40,87 --> 0:12:41,72
JOEY SURIEL: Well,
the MNC, yeah.


314
0:12:41,72 --> 0:12:42,91
FABIAN ALOMAR: Yeah,
you could say four.


315
0:12:42,91 --> 0:12:45,16
-All City, City Stars.


316
0:12:45,16 --> 0:12:46,83
ERIC PUPECKI: That's just
basic business.


317
0:12:46,83 --> 0:12:49,86
If you try to push a universal
product and you change the


318
0:12:49,86 --> 0:12:54,72
name every three months, the
people aren't that smart.


319
0:12:54,72 --> 0:12:57,69
You've got to drill it
into their heads.


320
0:12:57,69 --> 0:12:59,77
You think Girl would be as good
if they had to change


321
0:12:59,77 --> 0:13:1,68
their name three times?


322
0:13:1,68 --> 0:13:3,93
Maybe.


323
0:13:3,93 --> 0:13:7,0
That definitely probably put a
big hiccup in the business.


324
0:13:7,0 --> 0:13:10,52
If it stayed Menace, I think
that marketing would have been


325
0:13:10,52 --> 0:13:11,39
just through the roof.


326
0:13:11,39 --> 0:13:13,12
You wouldn't have been
able to stop it.


327
0:13:13,12 --> 0:15:13,12
