0:0:5,667 --> 0:0:8,66
The President:
It has now been three months
since the tragic events in


2
0:0:8,66 --> 0:0:9,967
Newtown, Connecticut.


3
0:0:9,967 --> 0:0:13,633
Three months since we lost
20 innocent children and six


4
0:0:13,633 --> 0:0:17,33
dedicated adults who had
so much left to give.


5
0:0:17,33 --> 0:0:19,66
Three months since
we, as Americans,


6
0:0:19,66 --> 0:0:22,467
began asking ourselves if we're
really doing enough to protect


7
0:0:22,467 --> 0:0:25,767
our communities and
keep our children safe.


8
0:0:25,767 --> 0:0:29,133
For the families who lost a
loved one on that terrible day,


9
0:0:29,133 --> 0:0:31,533
three months doesn't even
begin to ease the pain they're


10
0:0:31,533 --> 0:0:33,533
feeling right now.


11
0:0:33,533 --> 0:0:36,834
It doesn't come close to mending
the wounds that may never


12
0:0:36,834 --> 0:0:38,567
fully heal.


13
0:0:38,567 --> 0:0:43,0
But as a nation, the last
three months have changed us.


14
0:0:43,0 --> 0:0:45,567
They've forced us to answer some
difficult questions about what


15
0:0:45,567 --> 0:0:49,633
we can do -- what we must do
-- to prevent the kinds of


16
0:0:49,633 --> 0:0:53,934
massacres we've seen in Newtown
and Aurora and Oak Creek,


17
0:0:53,934 --> 0:0:56,4
as well as the everyday
tragedies that happen far too


18
0:0:56,4 --> 0:1:0,333
often in big cities and small
towns all across America.


19
0:1:0,333 --> 0:1:2,9
Today there is still genuine
disagreement among well-meaning


20
0:1:2,9 --> 0:1:5,3
people about what steps we
should take to reduce the


21
0:1:5,3 --> 0:1:8,233
epidemic of gun violence
in this country.


22
0:1:8,233 --> 0:1:11,867
But you -- the American
people -- have spoken.


23
0:1:11,867 --> 0:1:14,734
You've made it clear that
it's time to do something.


24
0:1:14,734 --> 0:1:17,533
And over the last few weeks,
senators here in Washington have


25
0:1:17,533 --> 0:1:20,867
listened and taken
some big steps forward.


26
0:1:20,867 --> 0:1:23,367
Two weeks ago, the Senate
advanced a bill that would make


27
0:1:23,367 --> 0:1:25,834
it harder for criminals and
people with a severe mental


28
0:1:25,834 --> 0:1:28,6
illness from getting
their hands on a gun --


29
0:1:28,6 --> 0:1:31,8
an idea supported by nine
out of ten Americans,


30
0:1:31,8 --> 0:1:34,5
including a majority
of gun owners.


31
0:1:34,5 --> 0:1:37,133
The Senate also made progress on
a bill that would crack down on


32
0:1:37,133 --> 0:1:40,367
anyone who buys a gun as part
of a scheme to funnel it to


33
0:1:40,367 --> 0:1:43,934
criminals -- reducing violent
crime and protecting our law


34
0:1:43,934 --> 0:1:46,0
enforcement officers.


35
0:1:46,0 --> 0:1:49,467
Finally, the Senate took steps
to reinstate and strengthen a


36
0:1:49,467 --> 0:1:53,233
ban on the sale of
military-style assault weapons,


37
0:1:53,233 --> 0:1:56,2
set a 10-round
limit for magazines,


38
0:1:56,2 --> 0:1:58,6
and make our schools
safer places for kids to


39
0:1:58,6 --> 0:2:0,667
learn and to grow.


40
0:2:0,667 --> 0:2:2,867
These ideas shouldn't
be controversial --


41
0:2:2,867 --> 0:2:4,6
they're common sense.


42
0:2:4,6 --> 0:2:7,4
They're supported by a majority
of the American people.


43
0:2:7,4 --> 0:2:10,333
And I urge the Senate and
the House to give each of


44
0:2:10,333 --> 0:2:12,333
them a vote.


45
0:2:12,333 --> 0:2:15,567
As I've said before, we may not
be able to prevent every act of


46
0:2:15,567 --> 0:2:17,5
violence in this country.


47
0:2:17,5 --> 0:2:20,5
But together, we have
an obligation to try.


48
0:2:20,5 --> 0:2:23,533
We have an obligation
to do what we can.


49
0:2:23,533 --> 0:2:26,467
Right now, we have a real
chance to reduce gun violence in


50
0:2:26,467 --> 0:2:30,166
America, and prevent
the very worst violence.


51
0:2:30,166 --> 0:2:33,467
We have a unique opportunity
to reaffirm our tradition of


52
0:2:33,467 --> 0:2:37,0
responsible gun ownership, and
also do more to keep guns out of


53
0:2:37,0 --> 0:2:41,367
the hands of criminals or people
with a severe mental illness.


54
0:2:41,367 --> 0:2:43,767
We've made progress over
the last three months,


55
0:2:43,767 --> 0:2:45,633
but we're not there yet.


56
0:2:45,633 --> 0:2:48,633
And in the weeks ahead, I hope
Members of Congress will join me


57
0:2:48,633 --> 0:2:52,3
in finishing the job --
for our communities and,


58
0:2:52,3 --> 0:2:55,233
most importantly, for our kids.


59
0:2:55,233 --> 0:4:55,233
Thanks.
