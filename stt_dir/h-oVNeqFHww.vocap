###5 Only one creature has carved a life for itself in every habitat on Earth.
###12 That creature is us.
###17 All over the world we still use our ingenuity to survive in the wild places,
###24 far from the city lights, face to face with raw nature.
###31 This is the Human Planet.
###48 The jungle is nature at its most vigorous, complex and mysterious.
###55 It may appear bountiful,
###59 but for humans, this is a surprisingly hostile environment.
###70 Though, through history, great civilisations have arisen here,
###82 none have stood the test of time.
###91 The jungle refuses to be tamed
###96 and it punishes those who don't live by its laws.
###106 Yet even today, there are some who guard the secrets
###109 of surviving in this wild world.
###112 These are the remarkable stories
###115 of the people who call the rainforest home.
###147 Tropical rainforests coverjust 2% of the planet's surface...
###152 ...but they're home to half of all species on Earth.
###157 The problem is, much of this life is in the tree-tops,
###162 a world way out of our reach.
###176 Exploiting the canopy's riches from the forest floor is so challenging,
###181 getting enough protein is a daily struggle.
###183 The
###196 Matis of Brazil are highly skilled hunters
###199 but for the past week there's been barely enough meat to go round.
###210 Benin is hungry and he's determined today's hunt will be more successful.
###222 Administering tree-frog toxin into his bloodstream purges his body,
###227 preparing it for action.
###240 The Matis also drop a noxious plant juice into their eyes
###250 to sharpen their senses and focus their minds on the hunt.
###260 Benin and the others summon the power of the animal spirits.
###283 Hunting canopy animals from the ground
###285 requires formidable fire power...
###287 ...a four-metre long blowpipe,
###294 precision-made to a design honed over thousands
###311 of years.
###316 Spotting animals in the dense vegetation is so hard
###320 the Matis rely on hearing to locate prey...
###330 ...and use mimicry to lure them into range.
###337 They can imitate all ten species of monkey found in these forests.
###345 (IMITATES MONKEY CALL)
###352 (MONKEY CRIES)
###356 A howler monkey responds.
###361 30 metres up, monkeys are feeding in a fig tree.
###377 Scoring the darts with piranha teeth
###380 ensures the poisoned tip breaks off in the victim's body.
###384 Unlike guns, blowpipes are near silent
###391 and can be fired without spooking the monkeys.
###398 Benin makes the first hit, and now the monkeys scatter.
###403 Once shot, the monkeys must be tracked
###409 as the curare-vine poison takes effect.
###416 This monkey's already weak, but it's hiding, and must be flushed out.
###422 They shoot again.
###428 But it's stuck in a vine now, and there's no choice but to go and get it.
###441 One down, but it's just the beginning.
###460 As one of the swiftest hunters,
###462 it's Benin's job to pick off any escaping monkeys.
###467 He shoots another, but misses.
###483 Benin fires again, this time on target.
###492 The monkey finally stops...
###499 ...and Benin takes aim one last time.
###507 Eight monkeys. It's been a good day.
###518 But all too often they return empty-handed.
###532 Hunting in the canopy is so difficult,
###534 people must find most of their food closer to the ground.
###539 But scratching a living on the forest floor is hardly any easier.
###546 The complex nature of this mysterious world is so hard to master,
###553 the lessons have to start early.
###564 Orlando's from the Piaroa tribe of Venezuela.
###569 He's like any other kid,
###570 only life in the jungle has already forced him to fend for himself.
###582 But this childhood adventure takes them deep into the jungle underworld.
###599 As only 2% of sunlight reaches the forest floor,
###603 surprisingly few plants grow and this means few animals.
###612 There's less protein here than in the desert...
###616 and much that is here is poisonous.
###626 Distinguishing dinner from danger is an essential life skill.
###639 Few creatures have a more sinister reputation than the one they seek.
###651 The goliath tarantula, the size of a dinner plate,
###669 the largest spider in the world.
###678 It's hard to imagine a less appetising meal,
###681 but picky eaters don't last long in the jungle.
###687 Besides, Orlando says they're delicious,
###694 and handling dangerous animals comes with the territory.
###704 From about five years old,
###705 Piaroa children know exactly where to hunt for spiders...
###709 ...and in a couple of hours can catch enough for a decent meal.
###721 But they have to be careful of both the huge fangs
###727 and of the hairs they kick towards any attacker.
###737 If they contact the skin or are inhaled, they cause a nasty reaction.
###750 Orlando's come off worst.
###754 But growing up in the jungle, he's used to a little discomfort.
###765 Tarantulas are best served toasted, like marshmallows.
###771 All the hairs must be singed off so they don't catch in the throat.
###778 And when they start squeaking,
###780 which is just air escaping from the joints, they're almost done.
###795 Tarantulas taste a bit like crab
###798 and, with a little seasoning, they go down a treat.
###813 Orlando's and his friends'survival
###814 depends upon embracing every opportunity in the forest
###831 Jungle people rely so heavily on their surroundings,
###835 they become a natural part of the forest
###838 and form extraordinary bonds with nature.
###852 Very few people live more intimately with animals than the Awa Guaja
###857 of the eastern Amazon.
###863 Nurturing a wide range of creatures from the forest,
###867 the Awa are obsessive pet keepers.
###877 And there are some animals they cherish above any others.
###884 Like the Matis, hunting monkeys is vital to the Awa's survival,
###889 providing nearly half their protein.
###892 But this relationship provides far more than food.
