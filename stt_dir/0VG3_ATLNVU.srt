1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:20,622



2
0:0:20,622 --> 0:0:23,19
PATRICK O'DELL: So we're near
where you're from, right?


3
0:0:23,19 --> 0:0:23,64
We're near Vancouver.


4
0:0:23,64 --> 0:0:24,81
RICK MCCRANK: Yeah, we're
really close to


5
0:0:24,81 --> 0:0:26,22
Vancouver right now.


6
0:0:26,22 --> 0:0:29,19
It's like an hour and a half
from here maybe on the road.


7
0:0:29,19 --> 0:0:30,545
PATRICK O'DELL: Have you
been here before?


8
0:0:30,545 --> 0:0:32,81
RICK MCCRANK: Yeah, I've been
to Orcas once before.


9
0:0:32,81 --> 0:0:36,44
I came here just on a regular
motorcycle camping trip.


10
0:0:36,44 --> 0:0:38,34
Look around, and it's amazing.


11
0:0:38,34 --> 0:0:38,82
You know what I mean?


12
0:0:38,82 --> 0:0:41,42
Like birds chirping,
water lapping.


13
0:0:41,42 --> 0:0:49,338



14
0:0:49,338 --> 0:0:52,24
PETER HEWITT: The
park is huge.


15
0:0:52,24 --> 0:0:55,5
It's the only park that was
built by Dreamland and


16
0:0:55,5 --> 0:0:56,51
Grindline together.


17
0:0:56,51 --> 0:0:58,385
They kind of came together
on this one.


18
0:0:58,385 --> 0:0:59,69
It shows.


19
0:0:59,69 --> 0:1:4,495
Came out really good, just
really different.


20
0:1:4,495 --> 0:1:5,4
PATRICK O'DELL: P-Stone,
what's the


21
0:1:5,4 --> 0:1:6,51
deal with your shirt?


22
0:1:6,51 --> 0:1:8,33
PRESTON MAIGETTER: It got
signed by everyone.


23
0:1:8,33 --> 0:1:10,51
PATRICK O'DELL: Everyone
in the world?


24
0:1:10,51 --> 0:1:12,35
PRESTON MAIGETTER: Just
on this trip.


25
0:1:12,35 --> 0:1:13,69
Even the O'Dell signed it.


26
0:1:13,69 --> 0:1:14,95
PATRICK O'DELL: I
didn't sign it.


27
0:1:14,95 --> 0:1:16,2
PRESTON MAIGETTER: You
didn't sign it?


28
0:1:16,2 --> 0:1:21,754



29
0:1:21,754 --> 0:1:23,3
MIKE CARROLL: Tight.


30
0:1:23,3 --> 0:1:24,43
PATRICK O'DELL: Is wizard
status messing


31
0:1:24,43 --> 0:1:26,645
with your demo skills?


32
0:1:26,645 --> 0:1:28,472
MIKE CARROLL: We're
doing a demo?


33
0:1:28,472 --> 0:1:30,212
Yeah, I guess so.


34
0:1:30,212 --> 0:1:32,83
PETER HEWITT: I truly think that
the wizard staffs aren't


35
0:1:32,83 --> 0:1:36,68
as magical on the board as
they are at the campsite.


36
0:1:36,68 --> 0:1:40,29
That's just an opinion
of mine.


37
0:1:40,29 --> 0:1:41,26
I could be wrong.


38
0:1:41,26 --> 0:1:43,14
Some people could
wizard it up.


39
0:1:43,14 --> 0:1:45,86
I'm in no mood for sticks
or wizards,


40
0:1:45,86 --> 0:1:49,575
warlocks, any kind of dragons.


41
0:1:49,575 --> 0:1:50,46
It's over.


42
0:1:50,46 --> 0:1:52,6
MIKE CARROLL: My eyes
feel really soggy.


43
0:1:52,6 --> 0:1:55,9



44
0:1:55,9 --> 0:1:56,73
Is that fair to say?


45
0:1:56,73 --> 0:1:57,31
I don't even know.


46
0:1:57,31 --> 0:2:0,3
But just like, they just feel
like gooey and soggy.


47
0:2:0,3 --> 0:2:3,96



48
0:2:3,96 --> 0:2:5,89
PATRICK O'DELL: Damn, that's
a very wizardy move.


49
0:2:5,89 --> 0:2:8,356
MALE SPEAKER: I know.


50
0:2:8,356 --> 0:2:9,674
PATRICK O'DELL: You have
wizard status, right?


51
0:2:9,674 --> 0:2:10,924
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


52
0:2:10,924 --> 0:2:27,678



53
0:2:27,678 --> 0:2:28,98
PATRICK O'DELL: Who's
more Canadian, you


54
0:2:28,98 --> 0:2:30,122
or the other Rick?


55
0:2:30,122 --> 0:2:32,446
RICK HOWARD: Rick is really
Canadian right now, the way


56
0:2:32,446 --> 0:2:35,965
he's fucking cruising
around out here.


57
0:2:35,965 --> 0:2:36,825
Look at all his friends!


58
0:2:36,825 --> 0:2:38,28
He's way more Canadian
than me.


59
0:2:38,28 --> 0:2:39,8
PATRICK O'DELL: You
go [INAUDIBLE]


60
0:2:39,8 --> 0:2:40,36
with Keegan and stuff?


61
0:2:40,36 --> 0:2:41,18
RICK MCCRANK: Yeah, I go--


62
0:2:41,18 --> 0:2:43,75
Keegan's like the guy
that I hang out


63
0:2:43,75 --> 0:2:46,27
with when I'm at home.


64
0:2:46,27 --> 0:2:50,39
But since he's been making a
run at being a pro skater


65
0:2:50,39 --> 0:2:52,36
finally, we seem to
be like, I'll be


66
0:2:52,36 --> 0:2:53,34
home, he'll be traveling.


67
0:2:53,34 --> 0:2:54,64
And then he'll be
home and I'll be


68
0:2:54,64 --> 0:2:56,65
travelling kind of thing.


69
0:2:56,65 --> 0:2:57,34
I don't really see him
all that much.


70
0:2:57,34 --> 0:2:58,3
But he's coming here today.


71
0:2:58,3 --> 0:3:1,438
So pretty excited to
hang out with him.


72
0:3:1,438 --> 0:3:2,294
PATRICK O'DELL: Keegan.


73
0:3:2,294 --> 0:3:3,15
KEEGAN SAUDER: Yes.


74
0:3:3,15 --> 0:3:4,58
PATRICK O'DELL: Is Rick
Howard any less


75
0:3:4,58 --> 0:3:6,48
Canadian than Rick McCrank?


76
0:3:6,48 --> 0:3:6,84
KEEGAN SAUDER: No.


77
0:3:6,84 --> 0:3:7,644
Same.


78
0:3:7,644 --> 0:3:8,886
Same thing.


79
0:3:8,886 --> 0:3:10,69
From the same land.


80
0:3:10,69 --> 0:3:11,536
PATRICK O'DELL: But
you guys all came


81
0:3:11,536 --> 0:3:12,886
out to see Rick McCrank?


82
0:3:12,886 --> 0:3:14,5
KEEGAN SAUDER: Yeah.


83
0:3:14,5 --> 0:3:15,9
ERIC KOSTON: Me and McCrank
almost had worst time ever


84
0:3:15,9 --> 0:3:16,32
over there.


85
0:3:16,32 --> 0:3:19,308
I don't know if you saw
that, but that was--


86
0:3:19,308 --> 0:3:20,802
I was maxed out.


87
0:3:20,802 --> 0:3:26,706



88
0:3:26,706 --> 0:3:30,46
PATRICK O'DELL: On this tour,
do you ever feel like, since


89
0:3:30,46 --> 0:3:34,42
all these guys drink so much and
like grill hamburgers and


90
0:3:34,42 --> 0:3:37,35
stuff, is it weird to be-- do
you feel like an outsider even


91
0:3:37,35 --> 0:3:38,63
on the tour?


92
0:3:38,63 --> 0:3:40,15
RICK MCCRANK: Since I've been
doing this, I've been


93
0:3:40,15 --> 0:3:43,12
vegetarian and I've been
straight, whatever.


94
0:3:43,12 --> 0:3:44,13
I don't drink.


95
0:3:44,13 --> 0:3:47,29
And so I'm just used to it,
you know what I mean?


96
0:3:47,29 --> 0:3:48,48
I don't trip on it.


97
0:3:48,48 --> 0:3:50,21
Sometimes I get a little bummed
when they bum other


98
0:3:50,21 --> 0:3:50,75
people out.


99
0:3:50,75 --> 0:3:52,67
I don't know, I just feel
bad for other people.


100
0:3:52,67 --> 0:3:55,5
I really don't like being a
nuisance and stuff like that.


101
0:3:55,5 --> 0:4:1,1
I can't stop that train.


102
0:4:1,1 --> 0:4:2,81
It's nothing against anybody,
you know what I mean?


103
0:4:2,81 --> 0:4:5,682
It's just my problem.


104
0:4:5,682 --> 0:4:9,168
RICK HOWARD: It could get
weird here tonight.


105
0:4:9,168 --> 0:4:11,16
I think it's going to happen.


106
0:4:11,16 --> 0:4:13,18
MALE SPEAKER: I thought you
were a better dancer.


107
0:4:13,18 --> 0:4:16,38
I was about to centipede up
under the [INAUDIBLE].


108
0:4:16,38 --> 0:4:17,63
No, it's OK.


109
0:4:17,63 --> 0:4:19,29
I'll appreciate what I got.


110
0:4:19,29 --> 0:4:22,308
But that was kind of budget.


111
0:4:22,308 --> 0:4:24,36
PETER HEWITT: At the park, they
were like, you guys can


112
0:4:24,36 --> 0:4:26,85
party at the house, but just
don't break anything.


113
0:4:26,85 --> 0:4:28,16
You might as well
broke something


114
0:4:28,16 --> 0:4:29,57
before they came over.


115
0:4:29,57 --> 0:4:30,81
Like it was ridiculous.


116
0:4:30,81 --> 0:4:32,3
Like, don't break anything.


117
0:4:32,3 --> 0:4:35,0
All right, head through
the window.


118
0:4:35,0 --> 0:4:36,76
Let's start it off
with someone's


119
0:4:36,76 --> 0:4:38,224
head through the window.


120
0:4:38,224 --> 0:4:43,103
MALE SPEAKER: All right, let's
not make a big deal out of it.


121
0:4:43,103 --> 0:4:44,81
MALE SPEAKER: Are you
fucking kidding me?


122
0:4:44,81 --> 0:4:47,15
Who the fuck broke this
fucking window?


123
0:4:47,15 --> 0:4:48,482
PATRICK O'DELL: Did
they get mad?


124
0:4:48,482 --> 0:4:50,17
I don't remember
what happened.


125
0:4:50,17 --> 0:4:51,6
MALE SPEAKER: I think they just
kind of gave us the boot.


126
0:4:51,6 --> 0:4:52,31
It was pretty mellow.


127
0:4:52,31 --> 0:4:53,2
Sorry, Moose.


128
0:4:53,2 --> 0:4:55,37
He's a nice host.


129
0:4:55,37 --> 0:4:58,662
I think somebody ended
up stealing his--


130
0:4:58,662 --> 0:5:1,87
he had a big inflatable Coors
can that somehow made it back


131
0:5:1,87 --> 0:5:3,11
with us, too.


132
0:5:3,11 --> 0:5:3,89
Sorry again, Moose.


133
0:5:3,89 --> 0:5:6,35
MIKE CARROLL: But seriously
dude, we were so psyched on


134
0:5:6,35 --> 0:5:7,835
all the dudes that
were skating.


135
0:5:7,835 --> 0:5:9,83
MOOSE: The Orcas park
is fab dude.


136
0:5:9,83 --> 0:5:10,74
Seriously, I was supposed
to be here for a week.


137
0:5:10,74 --> 0:5:12,1
I've been here 11 months.


138
0:5:12,1 --> 0:5:13,99
MIKE CARROLL: No, but all the
dudes that were shredding


139
0:5:13,99 --> 0:5:14,6
today, dude.


140
0:5:14,6 --> 0:5:15,15
That was so sick.


141
0:5:15,15 --> 0:5:16,14
MOOSE: All because
of that park.


142
0:5:16,14 --> 0:5:18,92
MALE SPEAKER: Preston carrying
a wizard staff that drug


143
0:5:18,92 --> 0:5:20,76
behind him.


144
0:5:20,76 --> 0:5:25,14
And people were like, jocks kept
making jokes like, nice


145
0:5:25,14 --> 0:5:26,576
beer collection.


146
0:5:26,576 --> 0:5:28,52
MALE SPEAKER: You won't make it
through the door with that.


147
0:5:28,52 --> 0:5:29,77
You'll get stuck.


148
0:5:29,77 --> 0:5:33,995



149
0:5:33,995 --> 0:5:37,47
MIKE CARROLL: That's
wizard staff.


150
0:5:37,47 --> 0:5:39,52
That's where the party-- when we
showed up, and we were all,


151
0:5:39,52 --> 0:5:41,83
all the girls on this
island are taken.


152
0:5:41,83 --> 0:5:44,86
Or no, they said, yeah, all the
girls on this island are


153
0:5:44,86 --> 0:5:46,652
spoken for.


154
0:5:46,652 --> 0:5:47,96
Like, dude.


155
0:5:47,96 --> 0:5:48,81
They were so weird.


156
0:5:48,81 --> 0:5:50,98
I mean, most of them
were cool.


157
0:5:50,98 --> 0:5:52,52
But they seemed like they
were starting to


158
0:5:52,52 --> 0:5:55,0
get a little uptight.


159
0:5:55,0 --> 0:5:56,61
That was a fun party, though.


160
0:5:56,61 --> 0:6:6,55



161
0:6:6,55 --> 0:6:10,526
This party's hella
epicly later'd.


162
0:6:10,526 --> 0:6:12,17
We gotta go.


163
0:6:12,17 --> 0:6:13,267
Later.


164
0:6:13,267 --> 0:6:18,975



165
0:6:18,975 --> 0:6:21,4
MALE SPEAKER: Some girl just
punches [INAUDIBLE]


166
0:6:21,4 --> 0:6:23,895
in the face.


167
0:6:23,895 --> 0:6:25,36
That was pretty awesome.


168
0:6:25,36 --> 0:6:26,79
That was weird last night.


169
0:6:26,79 --> 0:6:28,4
PATRICK O'DELL: What happened
at the party?


170
0:6:28,4 --> 0:6:30,848



171
0:6:30,848 --> 0:6:32,8
MALE SPEAKER: It was
actually rad.


172
0:6:32,8 --> 0:6:33,564
It was like--


173
0:6:33,564 --> 0:6:35,5
PATRICK O'DELL: What happened
at the party, Carroll?


174
0:6:35,5 --> 0:6:36,15
MALE SPEAKER: What happened
at the party?


175
0:6:36,15 --> 0:6:38,85
MIKE CARROLL: Nothing.


176
0:6:38,85 --> 0:6:40,82
Fucking, they're
all spoken for.


177
0:6:40,82 --> 0:7:7,87



178
0:7:7,87 --> 0:7:9,24
PETER HEWITT: The
gold jacket--


179
0:7:9,24 --> 0:7:10,76
PATRICK O'DELL: He brought
that with him.


180
0:7:10,76 --> 0:7:11,615
PETER HEWITT: That was his.


181
0:7:11,615 --> 0:7:13,31
PATRICK O'DELL: He brought
that with him.


182
0:7:13,31 --> 0:7:15,34
He knew that he was going
to break it out.


183
0:7:15,34 --> 0:7:16,54
PETER HEWITT: He knew that there
was going to be a party


184
0:7:16,54 --> 0:7:20,11
that required a gold jacket.


185
0:7:20,11 --> 0:7:23,48
So let's ride Orcas
out in this thing.


186
0:7:23,48 --> 0:7:25,96
Ding.


187
0:7:25,96 --> 0:7:26,41
PATRICK O'DELL: Did you
bring that from here?


188
0:7:26,41 --> 0:7:27,205
MIKE CARROLL: No.


189
0:7:27,205 --> 0:7:29,1
We were in Portland.


190
0:7:29,1 --> 0:7:31,58
Someone wanted to go grab a
sweatshirt or some shirts.


191
0:7:31,58 --> 0:7:33,25
So we stopped at like
an American Apparel.


192
0:7:33,25 --> 0:7:35,185
So we were just messing around
and just trying on


193
0:7:35,185 --> 0:7:36,83
all this gay shit.


194
0:7:36,83 --> 0:7:39,92
And then I just put that thing
on and some glasses or some


195
0:7:39,92 --> 0:7:42,37
other shit with it, whatever I
was buying, some other stuff.


196
0:7:42,37 --> 0:7:42,97
So I was like, fuck it.


197
0:7:42,97 --> 0:7:44,22
I'm just going to
take this thing.


198
0:7:44,22 --> 0:9:44,22
