###14 SHANE SMITH: Hello.
###15 
###18 The next morning we got back onto our one-car train and
###21 headed off into the wilderness.
###23 
###26 Every once in a while, there'd be a break in the trees, and
###28 we'd pass these massive logging camps that butted up
###31 against the train tracks that were obviously North Korean.
###34 We're on our little train going into the
###36 middle of the forest.
###37 This is a logging camps run by North Koreans.
###40 You can see there's a North Korean flag and North Korean
###44 propaganda in here.
###46 There, there's some North Koreans
###47 waving at us over there.
###49 All this wood is going to England.
###51 When we get off this train, [LAUGH]
###55 we're going to go out into the campus where they actually log
###58 out in the middle of Siberia.
###61 Freaky, freaky business.
###62 
###67 We finally started to approach our last stop, the tiny
###71 logging town of Tataul.
###72 Now Tataul is a freaky place.
###75 It's as if the Soviets had come up to the edge of
###77 civilization, then dropped off their Stalinists apartment
###80 blocks in the middle of nowhere, and then gotten back
###82 on the train and never looked back.
###85 At the train station, we met our new driver, a colorful
###87 local type known simply as "the Fish."
###91 SIMON OSTROVSKY: He just brought a
###92 shotgun into the car--
###94 [LAUGH]
###94 just in case.
###97 SHANE SMITH: Dog in the sidecar.
###98 Dog in the sidecar.
###99 SIMON OSTROVSKY: It looks like a Doberman.
###102 SHANE SMITH: His mouthful of gold teeth and his shiny track
###104 suit confirmed what we already suspected--
###106 the Fish and his crew were the local mob.
###110 SIMON OSTROVSKY: They've actually moved here from the
###111 camp, the abandoned camp that we visited yesterday, so--
###115 SHANE SMITH: Right, so the camp we were at is done.
###117 Now this is the new camp, even further afield.
###120 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Right.
###120 Yeah, we're going to their new camp, where they're actually
###123 operating now.
###124 SHANE SMITH: Ask him, maybe, if he thinks if
###125 they'll be angry or--
###126 IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###129 SHANE SMITH: [LAUGH]
###130 And he brought a shotgun.
###131 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yeah, I think that's probably pretty useful.
###134 SHANE SMITH: Is this the camp here?
###135 
###142 So we're here in a North Korean logging camp in the
###147 middle of Siberia.
###148 
###150 SIMON OSTROVSKY: This is where they bring the logs from the
###152 forest and put them onto railcars.
###154 
###157 SHANE SMITH: So there's Korean propaganda.
###160 There's some Korean writing.
###162 SIMON OSTROVSKY: It says, "we're going to take action to
###165 increase productivity during the winter time."
###168 SHANE SMITH: [LAUGH]
###168 OK.
###170 Here comes a Russian lady that we're going to have to--
###172 SIMON OSTROVSKY: She doesn't look happy.
###173 SHANE SMITH: Hello.
###173 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###176 SHANE SMITH: She immediately made a lot of phone calls and
###178 a lot of threats.
###180 Should we get arrested?
###181 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yes.
###182 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###183 
###196 SHANE SMITH: While we were arguing with her, a van
###198 straight out of 1957 pulled up, and, lo and behold, out
###201 came some North Koreans.
###203 SIMON OSTROVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###204 
###210 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###211 SIMON OSTROVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###212 
###217 SHANE SMITH: Jason's gone AWOL.
###219 He's in the camp.
###220 Jason's being shuttled back to fucking Pyongyang as we speak.
###224 Jason, our producer, slipped away with a small camera and
###227 started filming the camp.
###230 SIMON OSTROVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###232 
###235 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###237 
###245 SIMON OSTROVSKY: He's saying we've got to get permission
###246 from the embassy before we can show anything.
###248 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###250 
###292 SHANE SMITH: Now what he was saying was a revelation.
###294 We had come all this way so we could actually talk to North
###296 Koreans, and one of the first ones we met was admitting that
###299 the standard of living was a problem in the home country--
###302 which would never be admitted to in North Korea proper.
###304 In fact, when the political boss stepped in, he also
###307 admitted to living a hard life.
###309 But of course, he blamed it on America.
###311 MALE SPEAKER 3: [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###313 
###341 TRANSLATOR: [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###345 SHANE SMITH: [TALK-SINGING IN KOREAN]
###350 OK.
###352 So they won't let us in.
###354 They don't want to get in trouble, which is
###355 understandable.
###356 So they're kicking us out.
###358 We're going to try to go to the forest to actually find
###361 some North Korean workers who are actually
###363 cutting down the trees.
###364 
###374 You want a beer?
###374 Hello.
###375 [SPEAKING KOREAN].
