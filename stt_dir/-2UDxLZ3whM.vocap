###6 Activity on the building site is intense.
###10 The rainy season is fast approaching and the roof still needs to go on.
###21 Everyone's pulling their weight to complete on schedule.
###39 The roof is tiled with sago-palm leaves
###43 and rolls of tree bark make the floor and walls.
###63 In two weeks, with 42 workers, countless felled trees,
###67 30 bundles of palm leaves, 1 6 rolls of bark and 5 kilometres of twine,
###73 the new home is complete.
###76 It's time to move in.
###80 As always, modesty dictates a strict entrance policy.
###111 Everything must be carried up, even family pets
###116 and it's a long way back down if you forget something.
###128 The first fire is ceremonially lit,
###131 an interesting way to bless a wooden tree house,
###135 but health and safety regulations have yet to reach these parts.
###149 Parents are surprisingly relaxed
###150 as their children explore their limits in the new home.
###161 Through knowledge, skill and ingenuity
###186 rainforest people have mastered their environment.
###189 They live in tune with their surroundings
###196 and show it a respect that's being lost elsewhere.
###201 Their remarkable lives remind us that we are nothing without nature.
###233 Documenting the Papuan tree house build
###235 was the most challenging shoot for the Jungles team.
###238 They came prepared for two weeks filming in the tree-tops,
###243 but when things went wrong, it was the Korowai who saved the day.
###256 This shoot took cameraman Gavin Thurston, researcher Rachael Kinley
###264 and producer Tom Hugh-Jones
###265 to some of the least explored jungles in the world.
###271 We're about five days into the trip,
###272 we had a safe flight in, we had a very good welcome committee,
###276 and I believe it's about a three-day walk from here.
###281 No going back now.
###286 Though local porters help lighten the load,
###289 trekking through the swampy jungle proves tougher than expected.
###294 Well, I thought, if he's going in, we've got to show willing, haven't we?
###297 I was going to come and help, but I've just fallen in.
###304 But with only two weeks'filming, they have to push on.
###310 The crew eventually arrive at Lahayu's village to a warm welcome,
###315 Korowai style.
###316 This is Ninkana, and we are beginning the five minutes of handshake
###326 that seems to be necessary when you meet someone.
###330 Then it's time to talk business.
###342 Gavin's already spotted some local wildlife in unusual places.
###346 This is Nasai, if I've got his name right.
###348 He's got these amazing, um,
###350 apart from an amazing hornbill...
###352 penis sheath,
###354 he's got these feathers on the side here.
###358 Yakob. I think that's the sulphur-crested cockatoo.
###361 (IMITATES COCKATOO) Noisy, yeah?
###364 What else?
###365 Mambro. (IMITATES PIGEON)
###367 Pigeon?
###368 And the hornbill?
###370 Pfff...
###371 There we are, so that's today's nature lesson!
###378 The crew go to inspect the ironwood tree the Korowai have chosen.
###382 Well, the Korowai have found a really good tree.
###386 It's probably about 70 feet up to where they plan
###388 to build the tree house. It's looking good.
###392 A line is fired into a nearby tree to rig a camera position
###397 but the rope gets caught.
###400 One of these guys has just shinned right up there.
###405 It's an unbelievable bit of climbing.
###408 All I can say is, if that was anybody else up there,
###409 my heart would be in my throat, but he just looks so at ease.
###413 Problem solved, thanks to the Korowai.
###418 Now the ropes are up, it's Gavin's turn to impress.
###422 I think these guys are fascinated
###424 by how much paraphernalia we need to get up a tree.
###429 Especially when I can't do it properly.
###435 The Korowai begin building at an astonishing rate,
###440 leaving Gavin struggling to keep up.
###444 Just as he gets into the swing of things, rain stops play.
###449 It's been raining for 1 7 hours solid, I can't believe it.
###452 When it's this wet it's not safe for them to climb,
###452 the logs are really slippery.
###455 The water table has risen so much now
###458 we've got standing water everywhere,
###460 and the other detail you probably don't want to know
###461 is that the long drop too is completely full.
###467 With work at a standstill, the crew are invited for a social visit.
###471 It's a childhood dream.
###473 It's one of my first memories - when I was about six or seven,
###476 building a tree house about four foot off the ground
###479 in an apple tree in the garden
###479 and here I am coming to film the world experts.
###483 All Korowai houses are split into gender zones...
###486 ...and, on the women's side, Rachael's attracting a lot of attention.
###494 They seem to be wanting to get me to dress a bit like them.
###501 Before long she's going native.
###503 A little more than expected.
###509 With the skirt safely fastened,
###514 all that's left is for her to lose her trousers.
###517 We've had two hours of bonding with these people.
###523 It's just been really nice to sit down and get to know the tribe
###525 and to share some jokes with them, let them laugh at us
###530 and see a bit of their life.
###535 When the rain stops, the Korowai get going
###539 but Gavin's being encumbered by all his gear.
###543 I wonder if anybody's ever filmed a heart attack on a rope before.
###550 Once at the top of the tree, Gavin's kit comes into its own.
###555 This is quite a clever device, called a tree pod.
###558 It's got a couple of spikes
###559 and when you strap it to the tree you get a really good solid base.
###562 The camera goes on top of there.
###565 The tree they've chosen to put the tree house in,
###567 turns out it's the tallest tree for a good few hundred metres.
###571 And one of the things we wanted to do is be able to see the tree house
###575 in its environment, up in the canopy, and give a sense of height.
###578 It must be getting on for ten storeys high
###583 and just made out of sticks and rattan.
###584 It's quite an incredible bit of engineering.
###586 The whole time they've been building this tree house,
###590 there've just been really scary moments.
###594 Right now there's quite a large tree they're trying to fell
###596 but they are worried it might fall towards the tree house
###599 and take out the ladder.
###600 So instead of everybody getting out,
###602 there's three guys with long poles just pushing it out the way
###605 and they've got two more down here with a bit of rattan
###609 pulling it, in the hope that it will go away from the platform,
###612 but if it goes the wrong way, those three guys are going to die!
###618 (WHOOPING)
###620 Another tree falls. This time it's a little too close for comfort.
###627 Well, luckily they judged that one right and it didn't come our way.
###633 The building's near completion, but Gavin still has to shoot the big reveal.
###639 We've set up a line from the tree the tree house is in
###643 across to where I was filming from the tree pod.
###645 We're going to put the cable dolly on and get a really nice pull back
###648 to reveal the tree house right up in the canopy.
###658 (BEEPING)
###659 Please, baby.
###660 It won't go anywhere.
###663 - What has happened? - (BEEPING)
###665 It's died!
###667 For the first time ever.
###670 Oh, (BLEEP)!
###671 Yet again the Korowai come to the rescue.
###677 Traditional Korowai craftsmanship,
###680 a stick with another little bit of stick tied on the end.
###683 Come on, baby!
###687 Gavin retrieves the camera dolly in time for supper.
###690 Food supplies are running low so the Korowai serve up a local delicacy.
###697 Sago grubs.
###699 They're basically giant beetle grubs that live inside the sago palms.
###704 And they are a delicacy.
###705 The crunch at the end when you chew their teeth perhaps isn't the best.
###708 But other than that they are all right.
###711 GAVIN: You kept saying you wanted protein.
###713 He's gagging!
###714 RACHAEL: I think they taste like caviar. It's got that pop in your mouth.
###720 - Do you like them? - Mmmm.
###722 - You can have the rest, then. - Ah! Thanks. Some more!
###726 GAVIN: The verdict on the sago grubs is, they are edible
###729 but they are actually pretty disgusting!
###734 I'm still chewing!
###736 It's the final day and Gavin's last chance to shoot the grand finale.
###740 Today, it's all come together. The sun's shining,
###743 the guys are being really helpful and the cable dolly is behaving itself
###747 and hopefully this is the end shot for the sequence and the programme.
###756 It's just been incredible seeing the whole process
###759 of how they build the house this high up in the canopy.
###762 They all seem to have settled in very well. Most of them are asleep now.
###767 I'm knackered as well, actually.
###772 Spending time with the Korowai
###774 has given Gavin a different perspective on life.
###778 I find I judge my own inadequacies against their expertise and knowledge.
###782 You come here and you've got boots on in case of snake bites,
###785 you've got sun cream on because of the sun,
###787 you've got twin safety ropes to make sure, if one fails,
###790 you are caught on the other one.
###792 And these guys, OK, maybe they have a higher mortality rate,
###795 but they're much freer in their lifestyle.
###797 You know, they're shinning up and down these trees.
###799 I think I'd much rather live a shorter, fuller life, like they do out here.
