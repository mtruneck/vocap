###0 ron paul is now meeting in ohio are twenty three to twenty he is now second
###4 place in new hampshire if he is rising
###7 uh... tied looks really strong
###10 so they sent the panic it throughout this talbot when in fact politico has an
###15 article titled paul panic seizes i waste abolition
###20 quotes inside article ours so damning
###24 for what this that was friend
###25 thinks of outsiders like ron paul one actually overturn their apple cart
###30 uh... so they talk to one republican after another look at these closures
###33 becky beach
###35 along tomorrow republican who helped
###37 president
###38 george h_i_v_ bush and george w_ bush she says
###41 it would make the caucuses mostly irrelevant if not entirely irrelevant if
###46 all winners
###48 she continues you would have a very damaging effect
###51 because i don't think he could be elected president i'm booked iowa and
###54 national public unease
###55 wouldn't think he represents the will of the voters
###60 so not only does iowa caucus become irrelevant iran paul wins
###66 but she says
###67 that if he wins it doesn't even represent
###70 feelings but the real milo bombs let alone the nationalist
###73 but how can i represent them
###75 phillies iowa voters every trust voted and he came in number one
###81 the establishment is so deathly afraid of ron paul
###85 that anytime that he is
###87 got any advantage they want to minimize it
###90 in obliterated
###91 firstly was coming in
###93 atherton some of these uh... polls is out there like a high just a friendly
###96 guy comes unplugged secular make anything of it second out doesn't count
###100 as ron paul is a lot of active supporters on the ground when although i
###103 had a lot of actors words on another level off at all bob i had to absorb
###107 llama
###107 broad walton irrelevant rotate
###110 i tell you as a hundred times over
###113 totally disagree with the ron paul on at least half of those issues
###117 on social security on the income tax i'm getting really part of education i don't
###122 agree with them
###123 but this is a right
###125 in telugu i_d_ even if he wins he will be comes in number one
###129 not only is it dot calvo isn't although on board i will cut is becoming relevant
###134 but that the bhosale just bali
###137 but do you need
###138 it's absurd but it goes on such as one person
###141 his house speaker cried paulson
###144 uh... i don't think any candidate for burning the process in that fashion
###147 hopes the caucuses
###148 in anyway referring to ron paul's fervent supporters on the ground
###153 but that's about all caucuses about
###155 people are talking about a candidate who shot the caucuses
###159 we've only been doing this for her decades everybody knows or that's what a
###162 caucuses
###163 anytime anybody else wins
###165 they'd all look at that they've got a real momentum then side people on the
###168 net
###169 all hallways in alabama won the primary was because he does so well in iowa
###173 and the national presently huge stake out a bit and i think you're right to
###177 now when rob was about two and i'm now it's pervert in the process
###181 to actually win the caucus
###184 crocs are mind-blowing so uh... politico summarized by the way a what is that new
###189 short version of what the republican to do ron paul wins ignore him anyway
###195 if he was losing then are tempted these one day you know right
###198 did just don't want him to drop off our on call
###202 this is the interest in the same corrupt politics
###205 that has been going on in washington robert that's why this bothers me is
###208 that a panic disease not to take away their money for their that they're black
###211 money they like what while we get with a cold or money being corrupt rotblat
###215 let's do it
###217 so here is that
###219 governor terry branstad the governor of iowa quote
###222 people had a look at who comes in second and who comes in third
###225 alter christ sake
###227 and he continues government-run seagram's metro because in a strong
###230 second it definitely helps im going to new hampshire and other states
###235 what we do it that way when ron paul was coming a second or third being the
###238 center of the rosy relevant iran balls first know that what's relevant is
###241 coming second author
###244 this is a joke by his i've never seen a joke this it grotesque
###249 wages and this combo
###250 who could possibly say who wins is irrelevant the most important thing is
###254 to go that far
###256 piece we work
###258 this gifted death of ron paul
###260 uh... finally like in the nineteen th paragraph of this political article
###264 by fire exit quote
###265 this is doctor paul's hands on the most authentic principal came in the race
###269 might go quietly philip
###271 paul's campaign chairman joseph it
###274 outside of can appalls campaign there's not one positive things that about the
###279 leading candidate in iowa from the entire party okay
###283 uh... when they ask doug rosalie republican lawyer and brent said advisor
###288 uh... how uh... severe old
###290 warned it would be appalled
###292 one he said it would be quote
###294 a moral wound
###296 look at how much this that was really scared to death of ron paul
###300 they're like old day and the doctors coming he's gonna throw throw over
###304 terrible crime said no don't you don't get to take money anymore
###308 and is due to the beating of your daughters
###310 reading these quotes makes me wanna campaign for ron paul
###314 totally thoroughly
###316 and that we disagree with them i'm probably more than fifty percent
###319 of his issues
###320 here's at ten oh one he had not done yet i love this one
###324 sam clovis
###326 he he's a local talk shows he says i think up all win would be devastating
###330 for the state of iowa and the caucus process
###334 now you ready for who her clothes and supporting us that
###337 rick sent or
###339 now that's
###340 you get that
###341 rick sendo chance of winning the overall the national uh... into eric candidacy
###346 for the republicans insofar lower than ron paul's
###349 so if they are excuse was all rob hall can win over on national race for the
###353 republicans that's why we think it would hurt the iowa caucuses and make them
###357 irrelevant if you want i will talk this
###360 well how could you possibly say
###362 that every state or wins it'll be better now would be worth some of that logic
###365 because it isn't about ron paul
###368 effect on the highway caucuses it's about is if
###371 endemic corruption
###373 but they're all pumped up
###375 though i don't know i don't think i think your boss doctor ballpark village
###378 what went down that reject was ralph corrupts sellout all patients
###383 mexicano people going
###385 repairing that running autos i think i think it is not even god don't do it to
###389 us doctor weir u_n_ aid
###391 while you covering the process by weight
###394 critical finally conserve activists hammer scott
###398 she's bypassed a co-chair right so she's got it
###400 force in this race but nonetheless another quote just like the others i
###403 think your pervasiveness
###405 to see the process
###406 hijacked
###407 would be a concern for those who consider the pot or we have
###411 are being first-in-the-nation
###413 so when michelle bachman was leading the repair polls in iowa
###417 it was the greatest thing in the world and of course she deserved it
###421 but if ron paul wins he is hijacked the prize process
###428 and still not quite there but the more i read this stuff the more i think
###432 uh... you know what
###434 maybe some bigger chances with tucker on for
###436 because of this ellison is this deathly afraid of them he's certainly must be
###440 doing something right
