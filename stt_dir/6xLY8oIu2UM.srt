0:0:22,95 --> 0:0:23,46
JASON CROMBIE: Hi, I'm
Jason Crombie.


3
0:0:23,46 --> 0:0:26,6
And today I'm going to meet a
guy called Itsi who's New


4
0:0:26,6 --> 0:0:29,57
York's only Segway instructor.


5
0:0:29,57 --> 0:0:31,49
He's going to teach me
how to ride a Segway.


6
0:0:31,49 --> 0:0:34,75
And I'm also going to meet the
people from the New York City


7
0:0:34,75 --> 0:0:36,18
Jedi Academy.


8
0:0:36,18 --> 0:0:38,85
And they're going to teach me
how to handle a lightsaber.


9
0:0:38,85 --> 0:0:42,5
And then, when I'm good at
both of those things, I'm


10
0:0:42,5 --> 0:0:45,12
going to fight somebody on a
Segway with a lightsaber.


11
0:0:45,12 --> 0:0:46,69
ITSI ATKINS: Show the girls.


12
0:0:46,69 --> 0:0:48,192
No, come on--


13
0:0:48,192 --> 0:0:50,13
it's not about your breasts,
it's about--


14
0:0:50,13 --> 0:0:50,45
GABI: The balance?


15
0:0:50,45 --> 0:0:51,75
ITSI ATKINS: It's about
the balance center.


16
0:0:51,75 --> 0:0:53,48
See-- this is the headline,
from here to here.


17
0:0:53,48 --> 0:0:56,81
So directly middle of the
headline is the maximum force.


18
0:0:56,81 --> 0:1:0,57
It's kind of like the pyramid
structure, where the Earth


19
0:1:0,57 --> 0:1:3,73
brings the energy from
the pyramids.


20
0:1:3,73 --> 0:1:6,22
Actually, chest out, and you'll
pull forward, see?


21
0:1:6,22 --> 0:1:7,63
JASON CROMBIE: Oh, just leaning
forward, is that it?


22
0:1:7,63 --> 0:1:8,57
ITSI ATKINS: That's it.


23
0:1:8,57 --> 0:1:9,4
JASON CROMBIE: Oh.


24
0:1:9,4 --> 0:1:10,46
ITSI ATKINS: Now, let me tell
you the real thing.


25
0:1:10,46 --> 0:1:11,2
JASON CROMBIE: Sorry, dude.


26
0:1:11,2 --> 0:1:12,782
ITSI ATKINS: Toes down,
you'll go forward.


27
0:1:12,782 --> 0:1:14,39
Heels down, you'll go back.


28
0:1:14,39 --> 0:1:15,28
JASON CROMBIE: Oh,
that's easy.


29
0:1:15,28 --> 0:1:16,0
That's easy.

ITSI ATKINS: [INAUDIBLE].


32

MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Jesus.


33
0:1:18,73 --> 0:1:19,555
JASON CROMBIE: I'm going
to get mauled by a


34
0:1:19,555 --> 0:1:20,26
cat in one of those.

0:1:20,98 --> 0:1:22,26
ITSI ATKINS: OK, let's
go upstairs.


37
0:1:22,26 --> 0:1:23,518
I wanna wash my hands.


38
0:1:23,518 --> 0:1:25,86
Take a pee.


39
0:1:25,86 --> 0:1:26,88
JASON CROMBIE: I'm gonna
give you your bag back.


40
0:1:26,88 --> 0:1:27,537
ITSI ATKINS: Here you go.


41
0:1:27,537 --> 0:1:28,79
OK.


42
0:1:28,79 --> 0:1:29,83
I design handbags.


43
0:1:29,83 --> 0:1:31,801
It's the Bush shoe-throwing
handbag.


44
0:1:31,801 --> 0:1:40,747



45
0:1:40,747 --> 0:1:41,244

46
0:1:41,244 --> 0:1:42,238
ITSI ATKINS: Now stop.


47
0:1:42,238 --> 0:1:43,729
JASON CROMBIE: What's
with the paddles?


48
0:1:43,729 --> 0:1:49,693



49
0:1:49,693 --> 0:1:51,349
ITSI ATKINS: It's like a
bullfight where you go by and


50
0:1:51,349 --> 0:1:52,675
you get paddled.


51
0:1:52,675 --> 0:1:54,663
And then, if you're not standing
up straight, I go,


52
0:1:54,663 --> 0:1:55,68
stand up straight.


53
0:1:55,68 --> 0:1:58,8
And it's this whole
choreography of--


54
0:1:58,8 --> 0:2:0,15
JASON CROMBIE: So now I know how
to use a Segway, thanks to


55
0:2:0,15 --> 0:2:1,74
Itsi and his paddling.


56
0:2:1,74 --> 0:2:5,275
And now it's time for the New
York Jedi guys to show me how


57
0:2:5,275 --> 0:2:6,34
to use a lightsaber.

JEDI MALE 1: [INAUDIBLE],
come on.


60
0:2:12,196 --> 0:2:16,588
Every idiot knows that pepper
boards do not go on the floor.

0:2:21,97 --> 0:2:23,6
JEDI MALE 3: They can take a bit
of a beating, and they can


64
0:2:23,6 --> 0:2:24,43
give one, too.


65
0:2:24,43 --> 0:2:26,79
FLYNN: You have the rebound,
the follow-through,


66
0:2:26,79 --> 0:2:27,48
and then the lock.


67
0:2:27,48 --> 0:2:28,71
So let's try that.


68
0:2:28,71 --> 0:2:29,2
JASON CROMBIE: OK.


69
0:2:29,2 --> 0:2:29,97
FLYNN: Rebound.


70
0:2:29,97 --> 0:2:31,42
Follow-through.


71
0:2:31,42 --> 0:2:32,95
JASON CROMBIE: So they're
actually touching--


72
0:2:32,95 --> 0:2:33,24
on the follow-through?


73
0:2:33,24 --> 0:2:34,73
FLYNN: Right, you actually
don't have to touch.


74
0:2:34,73 --> 0:2:36,4
Like [INAUDIBLE], it's
a stage company.

on going to the next one.

JASON CROMBIE: OK.


78
0:2:39,16 --> 0:2:39,975
FLYNN: So hit the rebound.


79
0:2:39,975 --> 0:2:42,24
And follow-through.


80
0:2:42,24 --> 0:2:43,458
Lock.


81
0:2:43,458 --> 0:2:46,9

actually broadcasting to you,


82
0:2:46,9 --> 0:2:48,7
ah, I'm coming over here.

coming up here.

88
0:2:54,172 --> 0:2:54,64
JASON CROMBIE: Yeah, you
wouldn't do that,

0:2:54,64 --> 0:2:55,6

you've already got me.

like, Ah, I now have you where

was really scary.

was gonna go.

think you got enough.
