###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Fridays are awesome on CNN STUDENT NEWS. We`ve been hearing from
###4 some of you looking for more global headlines, we`ve got them, plus a report on Veterans
###8 Days. We are going to let Ms. Colvin`s (ph) students kick things off for us.

###15 UNIDENTIFIED MALES AND FEMALES: Hi. This is Ms. Colvin`s sixth grade advanced study class
###28 at East Hamilton Middle School. Take it away, Carl!

###40 AZUZ: First up, a new economic record in Greece and not a good one. In August, the country`s
###46 unemployment rate hit 25.4 percent. That means, a quarter of the entire country is out of
###52 work, and if you are 24 or younger, that unemployment rate jumps 260 percent.
###58 Greece has been struggling through a recession for five years. The country has massive debt.
###63 It`s getting a bailout, money to help out with this debt. But in order to get that money,
###68 the Greek government has to find ways to get its debt under control. What it`s been trying
###72 so far is austerity, spending cuts to things like workers` salaries and pensions. Many
###78 Greeks obviously not happy about this. While the country`s parliament was getting ready
###82 to approve a new round of cuts this week, thousands of protesters were fighting with
###87 police outside the parliament building.
###90 From Greece, we are going to move across the Atlantic Ocean to Guatemala. Parts of that
###94 Central American nation are recovering after it was hit by a powerful earthquake earlier
###98 this week. The quake had a magnitude of 7.4. That made it the strongest quake to hit Guatemala
###104 in more than 35 years. According to the country`s president, at least 52 people were killed
###109 in the quake, hundreds of others were treated for injuries, thousands of homes were damaged,
###115 and roads collapsed with rubble crushing cars all over Guatemala. The president said the
###120 damage of devastation could have been worse.
###123 Finally, we are heading over to Japan. In March of 2011, you might remember, the country`s
###129 suffered its worst earthquake ever: triggered a tsunami and giant ocean wave, and that led
###135 to a meltdown at the Japanese nuclear facility.
###138 We`ve reported on debris from that disaster washing ashore in Hawaii and in Alaska. But
###143 Japanese officials still have tons of it to deal with there, in Japan, and as Alex Zolbert
###149 explains, you can`t just throw it away.
###151 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###152 ALEX ZOLBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s been more than a year and a half since the devastating
###157 tsunami in Japan`s Tohoko region. And while substantial progress has been made, the country
###163 is still grappling with more than 13 million tons of debris.
###169 About 20 percent of what remains is said to be destroyed in other parts of the country.
###174 Today, trucks arrive at this incineration plan in Shizuoka, several hours drive south
###180 of Tokyo. Officials say, these debris is the shredded remnants of people`s homes, about
###187 250 kilometers or 150 miles from the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. But with concerns
###194 over possible fallouts still running high, officials here measure radiation levels, before
###200 a small crowd of onlookers. It`s a well choreographed, very deliberate routine. According to officials,
###208 this debris fails to trigger any elevated readings. The shipment is cleared. The truck
###215 pulls in and dumps its load, which is then hoisted into the incinerator.
###220 Once concerned citizens are pleased with what they`ve seen today.
###224 There are the critics here in Shizuoka, some who question the logic in transporting these
###228 debris more than 700 kilometers, or about 430 miles across the country. Than there are
###235 those who said a government should have been more transparent.
###239 Masahiro Kasyua (ph) says the affected area is using all of its incineration resources,
###245 they need our help, but we will continue to make our case as we`ve been doing. Carefully
###250 and tenaciously.
###251 A long and tedious project that is not short on controversy.
###258 Alex Zolbert, CNN, Shizuoka, Japan.

###262 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Ms. Flax`s social studies classes at
###268 Ness City Junior Senior High School in Ness City, Kansas.
###273 Armistice Day celebrate the end of what conflict? Here we go, was it American Revolution, World
###279 War I, Crimean War or World War II? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###290 Armistice Day marked the end of World War I. That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout",
###296 but that`s not what the holiday is called anymore in the U.S.
###300 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###302 AZUZ: No, it`s not. Armistice Day originally marked the 11th hour of the 11th day of the
###308 11th month in 1918. That`s when the armistice went into effect ending the fighting in World
###314 War I. But in 1954, President Eisenhower changed the name to Veterans Day in honor of everyone
###320 who`s ever served in the U.S. armed forces. So, whether that was during the Iraq war,
###324 for instance, in a humvee like this one beside me, or during a time of peace, Veterans Day
###329 occurs every year on November 11th. There are services like the traditional reed playing
###334 at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, and for Americans nationwide, it`s
###338 a chance to honor one of the country`s 21.5 million veterans, even if that`s simply by
###344 saying, thank you for your service.

###347 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? A document that`s faked or designed to be misleading
###352 is a forgery. This is true. Forged document are ones that have been made or altered falsely.
###360 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###362 AZUZ: Well, you might think that as students would forge a document in order to get out
###368 of school. There is a 21-year old in Michigan who recently forged a transcript and birth
###373 certificate in order to go to school. He went to class, played on a high school football
###378 team. James Felton of affiliate WNEM tells us what happened after the truth came out.
###384 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###384 JIM CONWAY, MOUNT PLEASURE H.S. ATHLETIC DIR.: Any time you are duped to -- or, you know,
###388 lied to, if you will, there is some frustration that comes with that.
###392 JAMES FELTON, WNEM CORRESPONDENT: Mount Pleasant High School athletic director, Jim Conway,
###395 is in shock. He is still trying to figure out why a 21-year old would lie his way back
###399 to high school and play for the football team. That`s exactly what happened to his Oiler
###404 ball club this season.
###405 CONWAY: When it comes to something like this, and integrity issue becomes difficult to swallow.
###410 FELTON: 21-year old used false documents to attend a school under the alias Javier Jones
###414 (ph). He played five games for the football team. Here you see him, he`s wearing number
###419 one. After the school received the tip from a concerned parent, Nash`s (ph) true identity
###423 was discovered. He was immediately removed from the district.
###427 Now, two Oiler victories may be forfeited.
###430 CONWAY: He just fit in with all the other high school kids, with the 16-17-18 year old
###433 kids who belong there, there were really no red flags.
###436 FELTON: Meanwhile, Conway says the students athletes are angry their hard work may be
###441 tarnished by one individual.
###442 CONWAY: They are frustrated, or if not more frustrated than the adults in this situation,
###447 which was good to see. I think the kids have learned a valuable lesson, they are asking
###451 the questions why and now just like we are as adults.
###453 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###454 AZUZ: Right now for a positive story from the football field. From a football faker
###459 to one that certainly looks like the real thing. Watch this. The pee wee player tearing
###464 up the field in this Youtube video, definitely deserves a highlight reel. 35 touchdowns,
###470 65 tackles, nearly 2000 rushing yards. It`s amazing. She is dominating the league.
###477 Yeah, I said, she. Samantha Gordon, she prefers the name "Sam," nine years old, she plays
###483 offence and defense in a mostly boys league in Utah. And she is amazing. During tryouts
###490 before the season started, Sam was tops in almost every drill. What`s crazy is that she
###495 just started playing football this year, it`s not even her favorite sport. She likes soccer
###500 better.
###500 The nearly 2 million people -- yeah, 2 million people have seen her play football, they might
###506 disagree with that.
###508 Rosalie Reimer is a little bit older than Sam Gordon, she is 15. That means she doesn`t
###513 have her driver`s license yet. But if you think that`s kept her from getting behind
###517 the wheel -- it hasn`t. Of course, Rosalie doesn`t drive regular cars, she drives this.
###523 Monster truck. She showed off her skills at the Arizona State Fair last weekend. When
###527 she is not in school, Rosalie is part of a monster truck competition circuit. She actually
###533 worked with her dad to build this behemoth, which is named detour. She is planning to
###538 go to college, get a degree in engineering, go to work designing racers, but she`ll probably
###543 still be connected to monster trucks. Rosalie says this is kind of thing you just never
###547 get tired of.
###549 Finally, getting a caravan together might be kind of a tall order. But that`s what you
###554 are dealing with when you are transporting a giraffe. You see its head? There it is.
###559 Two-year old giraffe in Australia is moving from one zoo to another, keeper said she was
###564 old enough to start mixing with other giraffes. Besides, she was about to outgrow her old
###568 home. It might sound like a risky proposition to move an exotic animal, but I`m sure they
###573 are used to this kind of thing, they probably didn`t have to stick their necks out. And
###576 how do you decide which drivers get to be in the convoy? They probably used a giraffal
###581 (ph) system. And afterwards, they could tell their friends, a tall tale. Yeah, that`s right.
###586 Giraffe puns. Head and shoulders above the rest. It`s time for us to hit the road, have
###589 a great weekend, we`ll see you again on Monday, by now.
