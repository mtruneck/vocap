CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: President Barack Obama,
Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney


2
0:0:30,54 --> 0:0:35,66
in 90 minute debate at Hofstra University
in Hempstead, New York, but the set up for


3
0:0:35,66 --> 0:0:39,57
this one was different than their first debate
two weeks ago. This time it was a town hall


4
0:0:39,57 --> 0:0:44,1
format. That means instead of the candidates
just answering questions from a moderator,


5
0:0:44,1 --> 0:0:48,12
they were asked questions directly by members
of the audience. And for last night`s debate,


6
0:0:48,12 --> 0:0:52,489
those questions came from people who hadn`t
yet made up their minds about whom they would


7
0:0:52,489 --> 0:0:57,93
be voting for in November. This second presidential
debate covered domestic and foreign policy


8
0:0:57,93 --> 0:1:4,1
issues, here is a look at some of the questions
and some of the candidates` answers.


9
0:1:4,1 --> 0:1:9,92
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


10
0:1:9,92 --> 0:1:16,929
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As a 20-year old college
student, all I hear from professors, neighbors


11
0:1:16,929 --> 0:1:21,429
and others is that when I graduate, I would
have little chance to get employment. What


12
0:1:21,429 --> 0:1:25,59
can you say to reassure me, but more importantly,
my parents that I`ll be able to sufficiently


13
0:1:25,59 --> 0:1:27,159
support myself after I graduate?


14
0:1:27,159 --> 0:1:29,159
MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
The key thing is to make sure you can get


15
0:1:29,159 --> 0:1:33,209
a job when you get out of school. And what`s
happened over the last four years, it`s been


16
0:1:33,209 --> 0:1:38,119
very, very hard for America`s young people.
I want you to be able to get a job. I know


17
0:1:38,119 --> 0:1:43,749
what it takes to get this economy going. With
half of college kids graduating this year


18
0:1:43,749 --> 0:1:49,56
without a college - without a job and without
a college level job, that`s just unacceptable.


19
0:1:49,56 --> 0:1:54,29
And likewise, you get more and more debt on
your back. So, more debt and less jobs. I`m


20
0:1:54,29 --> 0:1:57,419
going to change that. I know what it takes
to create good jobs again.


21
0:1:57,419 --> 0:1:59,34
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: The most important thing we can


22
0:1:59,34 --> 0:2:4,729
do is to make sure that we are creating jobs
in this country, but not just jobs, good paying


23
0:2:4,729 --> 0:2:10,92
jobs, ones that can support a family. And
what I want to do is build on the 5 million


24
0:2:10,92 --> 0:2:15,11
jobs that we`ve created over the last 30 months
in the private sector alone, and there are


25
0:2:15,11 --> 0:2:20,16
a bunch of things that we can do to make sure
your future is bright. Number one, I want


26
0:2:20,16 --> 0:2:23,48
to build manufacturing jobs in this country
again.


27
0:2:23,48 --> 0:2:27,2
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In what new ways do you
intend to rectify the inequalities in the


28
0:2:27,2 --> 0:2:32,9
workplace? Specifically regarding females,
making only 72 percent of what their male


29
0:2:32,9 --> 0:2:33,86
counterparts earn?


30
0:2:33,86 --> 0:2:41,75
OBAMA: Women are increasingly the breadwinners
in the family. This is not just a women`s


31
0:2:41,75 --> 0:2:46,0
issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle
class issue. And that`s why we`ve got to fight


32
0:2:46,0 --> 0:2:52,45
for it. It also means, that we`ve got to make
sure that young people like yourself are able


33
0:2:52,45 --> 0:2:53,44
to afford the college education.


34
0:2:53,44 --> 0:2:57,73
ROMNEY: We are going to have employers in
the new economy, in the economy I`m going


35
0:2:57,73 --> 0:3:2,51
to bring to play that are going to be so anxious
to get good workers, they are going to be


36
0:3:2,51 --> 0:3:10,17
anxious to hire women. In the last four years,
women have lost 580,000 jobs. That`s the net


37
0:3:10,17 --> 0:3:13,98
of what`s happened in the last four years.
We are still down 580,000 jobs.


38
0:3:13,98 --> 0:3:15,92
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


39
0:3:15,92 --> 0:3:22,71
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me.
I`m a position in the U.S. presidential cabinet.


40
0:3:22,71 --> 0:3:28,24
I`m fourth in line to the presidency. My primary
job is to give the president advice on foreign


41
0:3:28,24 --> 0:3:33,8
policy and then carry out the president`s
policy.


42
0:3:33,8 --> 0:3:40,3
I`m the Secretary of State, a position currently
held by Hillary Clinton.


43
0:3:40,3 --> 0:3:43,45
(END VIDEO CLIP)


44
0:3:43,45 --> 0:3:47,86
AZUZ: Secretary Clinton says another part
of her job is to be in charge of security


45
0:3:47,86 --> 0:3:53,29
at American diplomatic facilities, that means
U.S. embassy and consulate buildings in other


46
0:3:53,29 --> 0:3:58,29
countries. One of those facilities, the U.S.
consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was the target


47
0:3:58,29 --> 0:4:3,209
of a terrorist attack last month. Four Americans
were killed and there have been a lot of accusations


48
0:4:3,209 --> 0:4:8,18
and questions about whether there was enough
security at the consulate, and about which


49
0:4:8,18 --> 0:4:10,4
government officials should be held accountable.


50
0:4:10,4 --> 0:4:14,4
HILLARY CLINTON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:
I take responsibility. I`m in charge of the


51
0:4:14,4 --> 0:4:20,169
State Department. 60,000 plus people, all
over the world, 275 posts. The president and


52
0:4:20,169 --> 0:4:26,529
the vice president certainly wouldn`t be knowledgeable
about specific decisions that are made by


53
0:4:26,529 --> 0:4:27,56
security professionals.


54
0:4:27,56 --> 0:4:28,65
(END VIDEO CLIP)


55
0:4:28,65 --> 0:4:33,169
AZUZ: A group of center Republicans responded
to Secretary Clinton statement. They called


56
0:4:33,169 --> 0:4:38,5
it, a laudable gesture, but said the security
of Americans serving the nation around the


57
0:4:38,5 --> 0:4:40,96
world is ultimately the job of the president.


58
0:4:40,96 --> 0:4:41,949
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


59
0:4:41,949 --> 0:4:46,33
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to the social studies teachers and classes


60
0:4:46,33 --> 0:4:50,229
at Bemidji Middle School in Bemidji, Minnesota.


61
0:4:50,229 --> 0:4:55,379
Who was the first person to break the sound
barrier? Here we go. Was it Chuck Yeager,


62
0:4:55,379 --> 0:5:4,77
Sally Ride, Neil Armstrong or Usain Bolt?
You`ve got three seconds, go.


63
0:5:4,77 --> 0:5:11,69
Chuck Yeager broke the barrier when he flew
faster than the speed of sound in a rocket


64
0:5:11,69 --> 0:5:17,669
plane named after his wife. That`s your answer
and that`s your "Shoutout."


65
0:5:17,669 --> 0:5:19,439
(END VIDEO CLIP)


66
0:5:19,439 --> 0:5:25,319
AZUZ: Yeager made that supersonic flight back
in 1947. He was an Air Force test pilot who


67
0:5:25,319 --> 0:5:30,27
flew more than 200 types of military aircraft.
Yeager said his historic flight help give


68
0:5:30,27 --> 0:5:36,629
the U.S. a huge advantage in aviation advancement.
Now, the speed of sound is the rate at which


69
0:5:36,629 --> 0:5:42,33
sound waves move through different materials.
In the air it can depend a little on temperature.


70
0:5:42,33 --> 0:5:48,3
But it`s usually around 750 miles per hour.
On Sunday, Felix Baumgartner was traveling


71
0:5:48,3 --> 0:5:54,479
faster than that without a plane on his record
breaking skydive. But he wasn`t the only one


72
0:5:54,479 --> 0:6:0,439
breaking the sound barrier. That same day
exactly 65 years to the minute after he first


73
0:6:0,439 --> 0:6:6,789
broke it, Chuck Yeager did it again, the 89-year
old retired general went up in an F-15 jet


74
0:6:6,789 --> 0:6:9,9
to fly faster than the speed of sound again.


75
0:6:9,9 --> 0:6:17,11
All right, here is a quick quiz for you. What
is the best-selling toy of all time? Your


76
0:6:17,11 --> 0:6:23,499
hint: it is not a doll, it`s not a videogame,
it`s not an action figure or a toy car. It`s


77
0:6:23,499 --> 0:6:28,55
a puzzle, and it`s based on geometry. It`s
named after the guy who invented it and if


78
0:6:28,55 --> 0:6:33,219
you give up, because I probably would have
by now, we are going to let Nick Glass fill


79
0:6:33,219 --> 0:6:34,259
in the answer.


80
0:6:34,259 --> 0:6:35,4
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


81
0:6:35,4 --> 0:6:41,259
NICK GLASS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is a stainless
steel sculpture of the world`s best-selling


82
0:6:41,259 --> 0:6:46,949
toy here in a park in Hungary. We know better
from the handheld version, and hundreds of


83
0:6:46,949 --> 0:6:51,129
millions of these can be found around the
world.


84
0:6:51,129 --> 0:6:58,96
It`s named after the professor who first dreamt
up the puzzle in 1974. Although, against his


85
0:6:58,96 --> 0:7:3,249
wishes, Erno Rubik didn`t really want to be
famous.


86
0:7:3,249 --> 0:7:11,749
The Rubik`s Cube, the toy of 1980s, is now
enjoying the revival with 7 million sold last year.


87
0:7:11,749 --> 0:7:18,71
A professor in interior design, Rubik first
used the cube as a teaching aid.


88
0:7:18,71 --> 0:7:26,2
ERNO RUBIK, INVENTOR: I believe the most characteristic
part of the cube is contradiction between


89
0:7:26,2 --> 0:7:32,499
simplicity and complexity. First of all, I
love geometry, because geometry is the knowledge


90
0:7:32,499 --> 0:7:36,279
of how the whole universe is structured.


91
0:7:36,279 --> 0:7:43,89
GLASS: The three-by-three cube consists of
27 cube faces. Color- coded, these can be


92
0:7:43,89 --> 0:7:51,139
arranged in 43 quintillion different ways.
But there is only one solution.


93
0:7:51,139 --> 0:8:2,8
The last few years has seen a rise in speed
cubing competitions, demon cubers racing against


94
0:8:2,8 --> 0:8:9,49
each other and the clock. It`s been proved
that every cube can be solved in surprisingly


95
0:8:9,49 --> 0:8:15,499
just 20 moves or less. 
If only it was that easy.


96
0:8:15,499 --> 0:8:21,509
Erno Rubik himself cannot compete with the
young guns. It took him a month to crack it


97
0:8:21,509 --> 0:8:24,33
way back in 1974. And now ...


98
0:8:24,33 --> 0:8:26,96
(on camera): Are you a good Rubik cube player?


99
0:8:26,96 --> 0:8:36,52
RUBIK: It`s for me it was about one minute,
my time when I was practicing, and actual


100
0:8:36,52 --> 0:8:41,21
world record is five point something seconds.


101
0:8:41,21 --> 0:8:51,18
GLASS: Most toys come and go. But not Rubik`s
cube. It`s now almost 40 years old, and it`s


102
0:8:51,18 --> 0:8:52,8
here to stay.


103
0:8:52,8 --> 0:8:53,88
(END VIDEOTAPE)


104
0:8:53,88 --> 0:9:0,25
AZUZ: Felix Baumgartner`s record skydive,
this video makes it look like child`s play.


105
0:9:0,25 --> 0:9:5,29
But what do you expect when you recreate the
moment with Legos? They got it pretty close,


106
0:9:5,29 --> 0:9:9,62
too, although I don`t think this capsule is
going up quite as high as Felix`s did. That


107
0:9:9,62 --> 0:9:14,49
first step is still a doozy, and chances are,
this guy didn`t break the speed of sound on


108
0:9:14,49 --> 0:9:19,45
his way down, but there were some cheers,
probably, when his chute open and he made


109
0:9:19,45 --> 0:9:23,33
a successful landing. Of course, he refused
to give interviews afterward, he was kind


110
0:9:23,33 --> 0:9:27,97
of a blockhead about it. But how do you come
up with the idea to recreate something like


111
0:9:27,97 --> 0:9:32,74
that? You really have to use your homagination.
We were toying around with other ideas for


112
0:9:32,74 --> 0:9:35,85
the pun, but it`s just time for us to Lego
your attention. We`ll see you tomorrow when


113
0:9:35,85 --> 0:11:35,85
CNN STUDENT NEWS returns.
