###8 JAMIE THOMAS: I lived in Pacific Beach at the time and
###10 we just kind of lived in this weird
###12 apartment in Pacific Beach.
###13 Yeah, he stayed with me for almost a year.
###15 At least it felt like a year.
###17 Yeah, it was a Skate house and we lived right across the
###18 street from the Alien Workshop house.
###20 That's how those relationships started.
###23 JOSH KALIS: Yeah, the Alien house was right across the
###24 street and it was right up my alley.
###27 I mean, it was like Clyde Singleton, Kelly Bird, Drake
###30 Jones, Lenny Kirk, and Rob Dyrdek.
###33 I mean, all those guys were there, and it was dominoes,
###36 dice, 40s and weed.
###38 And that's what I liked.
###40 So I hung out with them all the time.
###42 ROB DYRDEK: And we lived in the most psycho party house
###45 that was like--
###46 not only was it like the whole Alien team and [INAUDIBLE] and
###51 Weese and just madness.
###52 Like one of the craziest times in my entire life, where not
###55 only the four of us lived there, but then we just--
###57 it was just absolute mayhem every single night.
###61 Like chicks and rolling dice every night.
###63 It was like the most psycho skate house of all time.
###66 JAMIE THOMAS: No, they had the party house and they had
###68 chicks and stuff.
###69 It was like, it was obvious, you know?
###71 I never got it.
###72 I never really--
###73 I thought it was cool.
###74 We were like skate homies.
###75 And then he would go over and hang out at Alien house to get
###78 into like, the party scene and whatever.
###80 Smoking weed or cigarettes, whatever.
###83 It was cool.
###84 I'd go over there too sometimes, and I wouldn't stay
###86 as long as Josh.
###86 Josh would stay every night.
###88 Like we lived like across the street, so he would just walk
###90 back to my house at like 3:00 in the morning.
###92 And then we'd go skate the next day.
###94 And then after we were done skating at night, we'd get
###96 some food together, and then he'd go over to the Alien
###97 house and hang out.
###98 And I would, like, I don't know.
###99 I'd hang out with a girl or watch a movie or something I
###101 had such a mellow lifestyle.
###103 I was like, whatever.
###105 Two totally different worlds.
###106 So basically he lived with me for like six months to a year.
###109 And we made the Heavy Metal video.
###111 And he was killing it in the Heavy Metal zone.
###115 
###118 And we were filming every day.
###119 We were just doing random lines in California.
###122 And it was sick.
###124 And we had a really good time filming that part.
###126 It was a lot of fun.
###127 And he was skating so good.
###129 He three-flipped a trash can off the
###130 smallest bump in the world.
###132 Like basically, it was like a little ripple
###134 in the parking lot.
###134 And he three-flipped it straight over a trash can.
###136 At the time, it was like phenomenal.
###137 Like, nobody had seen that.
###139 I remember when that came out, people were tripping.
###141 Just the way he did tricks, too.
###143 It was so proper and so unique.
###145 
###149 MIKE BLABAC: A few years later I moved to SF and he was there
###153 with Jamie, right when they were filming for
###154 a Toy Machine video.
###155 And then I watched his part and I was tripping on how,
###159 what an amazing skater he'd become from that skate rat
###163 that I was chilling with, trying to figure out how to
###165 shoot photos of three, four years earlier.
###169 PATRICK O'DELL: Is that him?
###170 MIKE BLABAC: Yeah.
###171 That's his switch crook.
###172 I remember he'd just filmed that a day or two prior in the
###175 first Toy Machine.
###176 
###180 JOSH KALIS: It was cool, but Jamie, Jamie was always real
###183 cool and real nice.
###184 But I mean, he's a work horse and he's got a different work
###189 ethic than me.
###191 I told you my work ethic is like, I need to be enjoying
###195 what I do and having fun.
###198 Then I'm a work horse.
###201 Jamie wants to make sure he goes and gets
###205 what he needs to get.
###207 And I wasn't that dude.
###211 I like to hang out and work.
###213 And he liked to go to work.
###215 And we just didn't click like that.
###218 JAMIE THOMAS: Oh my god.
###219 MALE SPEAKER: You all right, man?
###221 MALE SPEAKER: You bumped your bill?
###222 JAMIE THOMAS: Oh my god.
###223 ROB DYRDEK: I mean, he lived with straight-edge, hardcore
###227 Jamie Thomas at Jamie Thomas's rawest.
###231 Living in a little apartment in PB, like grinding, like
###236 just building what he would later become.
###239 And you know, as much as Jamie had helped him and--
###242 he just wasn't like that.
###244 He just wasn't in that sort of mindset.
###246 
###249 JOSH KALIS: He played too many practical jokes on me, you
###251 know what mean?
###251 Like, I was kind of a serious dude who was just getting out
###255 of, like, being a tough guy.
###257 I just couldn't get down with it.
###259 I couldn't get down with Ed's crazy--
###263 I couldn't eat hamburgers in the house, just because like
###266 he's this crazy vegetarian and the smell bothered him.
###269 So I had to eat outside all the time.
###271 I just--
###273 I just couldn't deal with it.
###274 We were two completely different people.
###278 Basically, he smoked, and I used to buy him food, but I
###280 wouldn't buy him cigarettes because I was kind of like
###282 straight-edge dude or whatever at that time.
###283 And I just thought it was lame that, like, he had these
###286 addictions that I had to support.
###288 So I just refused to buy him cigarettes.
###290 So I swear, he basically just would hustle me for
###294 cigarettes.
###294 He would like, he would ask me, like, dude, if I do this
###297 trick in this many tries, will you get me a pack of
###300 cigarettes?
###301 [SCREAM]
###303 So I would like bet him cigarettes for tricks.
###305 I remember one time he won a carton off me and he was so,
###308 so psyched.
###309 I asked him to three-flip this flat gap.
###311 I told him I'd give him a carton of cigarettes if he
###313 made it next try or something.
###315 And he made it.
###316 It was pretty gnarly at the time.
###318 
###320 JOSH KALIS: What's up, fool!
###321 Ha-ha!
###322 I want my cigarettes, boy.
###324 JAMIE THOMAS: [LAUGHING]
###327 How you gonna skate that good for cigarettes.
###329 
###334 MALE SPEAKER: It's funny.
###334 A lot of people would think that you wouldn't fit in with
###336 the, like the Toy Machine vibe.
###338 Like you know what I mean?
###338 It's always almost trivia.
###340 Like, Josh Kalis used to be on Toy Machine.
###342 JOSH KALIS: Shit, I didn't fit in that.
###344 That's why I quit, you know?
###346 ANTHONY CLARAVALL: Even when I met him, he
###347 was over Toy Machine.
###348 I remember going to his apartment, and like, I
###350 remember looking in his closet one time.
###352 We were in his room and he looked in his closet and he
###354 had, like, stacks of t-shirts, stacks of Toy Machine
###357 t-shirts, in plastic.
###358 Like brand new.
###359 And I mean, to me that was a trip.
###361 I mean, I was like, wow, man.
###362 And he was like, yeah, man.
###364 That's all garbage.
###366 I ain't gonna ride for Toy Machine.
###367 And I was just thinking like, damn, dude.
###370 I kinda want a t-shirt, but I don't want to ask for one.
###372 JOSH KALIS: I was now into going to San Francisco.
###375 I stayed with Drake Jones all the time.
###378 And he was actually working out a little thing for me to
###381 get on Real.
###382 And I was riding Real boards, and like, I was
###385 going to ride for Real.
###386 100%.
###387 JAMIE THOMAS: I kind of saw it coming, though.
###388 He moved to San Francisco and kind of just got a whole new
###392 crew and stuff.
###393 We started talking a little less and less.
###394 He was still riding for Toy Machine, but he was wearing
###397 different shoes every time I saw him.
###399 He was on flow for three or four different shoe companies.
###401 
###404 JOSH KALIS: Yeah.
###404 JAMIE THOMAS: I think he felt like he fit in more at Real,
###406 you know, I mean, like you said, Toy Machine was Ed, who
###409 was kind of artsy and quirky, to himself, kind of about his
###412 whole vegan vibe.
###413 And I was hard-core skate-focused.
###416 And I don't know, man.
###418 I can imagine why.
###419 I see the fit-in, you know?
###420 He felt like he fit in.
###422 And so the trade show came up.
###424 And Drake Jones came down and he was like, yo, Thibault and
###429 those guys, they're ready to do it, right now.
###431 And I was like, that's what's up.
###432 All right, I'm gonna go quit Toy Machine.
###433 Right now.
###434 Right this minute.
###435 And he was like, all right.
###436 So I'm walking down the ASR hallway and I make a right and
###440 I just bump face-to-face with Dyrdek.
###443 And Dyrdek was like, where you going right now?
###444 I was like, I'm going to quit Toy Machine.
###446 And he was like, for who?
###449 And I was like--
###451 before I could even say Real, he was like, we'll cut you a
###453 check right now.
###454 And I was like, oh shit.
###457 Let's do it.
###458 And that was it.
###459 I went and met Chris Carter and he wrote me a check right
###462 there, I think it was like $250 or some shit.
###464 And he was like, boop.
###466 ROB DYRDEK: It was really a mutual, like, I would love to
###468 ride for Alien.
###469 You know?
###470 It would be so sick if I was on like Alien team.
###474 Like you guys have so much fun.
###476 That'd be sick.
###477 And we're like, dude, you're on.
###479 If you want to be on, you're on.
###481 Like no, don't say, really though?
###482 And we're like, yeah, you're on.
###485 And that's really how it worked.
###486 That's how he works.
###486 He'll be like, oh, like say something, like that's sick.
###489 And like, yep.
###490 You're on
###491 JOSH KALIS: Once I figured out that Alien was a
###493 real option and I--
###496 that's where I hung out with every day.
###498 And I had to do it.
###499 I was like, fuck, those are my homies.
###501 Boom.
###502 JAMIE THOMAS: Yeah, of course it was a bummer, man.
###503 I mean, I'd--
###505 I was--
###507 you know, like any time when you like help somebody out and
###509 you like help them out of whatever situation they're in,
###512 I kind of was like the dude he leaned on for a long time, for
###516 emotional and financial support, like in every aspect.
###520 And when you give like that, I mean, it obviously feels good
###523 to help somebody out.
###524 But if they're able to just break it off at like a
###527 moment's notice, it feels kind of gnarly, you know?
###530 It's almost like you're in like a
###531 relationship or something.
###532 Not to sound too sappy, but it was pretty,
###535 it was pretty heavy.
###536 I remember being pretty bummed.
###538 Like it rocked me for like a week or two, where I was just,
###540 like, lump in your throat.
###542 It sucks.
###544 It was never really that weird between us.
###545 I was a little bit butt-hurt for a while,
###548 but I got over it.
###549 And when I'd see him, I'd always act like it was cool,
###552 even if I was a little bitter still.
###554 
###557 It was all right, man.
###557 I got over it.
###558 We just moved on.
###559 At any rate, I saw him like five years later.
###561 I came through Philly and he like, sat me down.
###564 We were away from the crew for a minute.
###566 And he was just like man, I just want to tell you how much
###568 I appreciate you helping me out back in the day.
###571 If it weren't for you I wouldn't be in skating right
###573 now, and I just kind of want you to know that.
###575 And I was like, cool, man.
###577 Thanks.
###578 JOSH KALIS: Yeah, I got to--
###579 I got to give way more credit to my dude Jamie Thomas, man.
###584 Like that dude made all this shit possible for me.
###590 When he gave me the opportunity to come out here,
###592 and like paid for me for six, eight months or whatever, just
###597 for me to like turn around and quit the company that I rode
###600 for with him--
###602 I mean, that dude pretty much paved the
###603 whole way for me, man.
###606 I guess if I owe anyone in this shit, it would be him.
###608 You know what I mean?
###610 He's a good dude.
###613 PATRICK O'DELL: It would have been funny if you were in
###615 Welcome to Hell.
###617 JOSH KALIS: Yeah, I think I just missed that one.
###619 I just missed Welcome to Hell.
###621 You know, actually, it was probably a good thing I missed
###623 Welcome to Hell, because I had already broken both ankles and
###627 a foot by that time, and I just couldn't be a
###630 stair-jumper or a rail-jumper anymore.
###633 And I don't know what the hell I would have done if I would
###636 have stayed and Jamie take me to the rail spots.
###640 Like, oh my god.
###641
