[CAR ENGINE]


2
0:0:3,423 --> 0:0:14,69



3
0:0:14,69 --> 0:0:17,45
For a while now, Audi has
owned the fast estate


4
0:0:17,45 --> 0:0:18,76
marketplace.


5
0:0:18,76 --> 0:0:22,69
Yes, Merc sold the odd E55
wagon, and BMW occasionally


6
0:0:22,69 --> 0:0:27,18
lobbed us an M5 Touring, but
they never sold the way RS4's


7
0:0:27,18 --> 0:0:29,69
and RS6's sold.


8
0:0:29,69 --> 0:0:32,56
In many ways, the success of
the RS6 perfectly describes


9
0:0:32,56 --> 0:0:35,8
the dichotomy between a road
test assessment of a car and


10
0:0:35,8 --> 0:0:38,55
what people actually
want to live with.


11
0:0:38,55 --> 0:0:41,34
In the magazine test, four-wheel
drive means stars


12
0:0:41,34 --> 0:0:42,77
deducted for understeer.


13
0:0:42,77 --> 0:0:44,64
In the real world, it
means safety and


14
0:0:44,64 --> 0:0:46,19
traction in the wet.


15
0:0:46,19 --> 0:0:48,43
Turbocharging means a hammering
for poor throttle


16
0:0:48,43 --> 0:0:50,395
response from your average
journalist--


17
0:0:50,395 --> 0:0:51,31
that's me--


18
0:0:51,31 --> 0:0:53,3
but massive power gains
for the owner, if


19
0:0:53,3 --> 0:0:55,21
they bend the rules.


20
0:0:55,21 --> 0:0:59,9
Objectively, the last RS6 was
blunt, effective, very fast,


21
0:0:59,9 --> 0:1:1,14
and not really enjoyable.


22
0:1:1,14 --> 0:1:5,6
But the people who owned
them loved them.


23
0:1:5,6 --> 0:1:7,87
Audi reckons the new one is
quite different, that it


24
0:1:7,87 --> 0:1:9,19
actually handles.


25
0:1:9,19 --> 0:1:12,9
It will need to be to beat this
lump of Stuttgart heavy


26
0:1:12,9 --> 0:1:16,95
artillery, the Mercedes CLS63
AMG Shooting Brake.


27
0:1:16,95 --> 0:1:18,77
Why not an E class, you cry?


28
0:1:18,77 --> 0:1:22,5
Because this is just as big as
the RS6 inside, and it looks


29
0:1:22,5 --> 0:1:23,3
bloody wonderful.


30
0:1:23,3 --> 0:1:26,98



31
0:1:26,98 --> 0:1:32,43
Oh, Audi, Audi, Audi, you
do confuse me so.


32
0:1:32,43 --> 0:1:35,37
I've always thought the RS6 was
the car that I shouldn't


33
0:1:35,37 --> 0:1:37,1
buy from you.


34
0:1:37,1 --> 0:1:39,49
It was just a bit too big,
a bit too heavy.


35
0:1:39,49 --> 0:1:41,76
Yes, it could pulverize stuff
in a straight line.


36
0:1:41,76 --> 0:1:43,88
And if you gave it to the right
man, he could extract a


37
0:1:43,88 --> 0:1:45,4
million horsepower from it.


38
0:1:45,4 --> 0:1:48,74
But to drive, it was always
a bit nothing.


39
0:1:48,74 --> 0:1:50,74
In fact, it was the worst
car you made.


40
0:1:50,74 --> 0:1:55,98
Why, then, is the new RS6 one
of the best cars you make?


41
0:1:55,98 --> 0:1:58,7
For starters, it handles.


42
0:1:58,7 --> 0:2:0,12
This car is not on
air suspension.


43
0:2:0,12 --> 0:2:2,25
I was led to believe that
the RS6 had to be on air


44
0:2:2,25 --> 0:2:3,23
suspension to work.


45
0:2:3,23 --> 0:2:5,64
But this is on the normal
springs with the fancy,


46
0:2:5,64 --> 0:2:6,52
adjustable dampers.


47
0:2:6,52 --> 0:2:9,36
And in comfort, it's lovely.


48
0:2:9,36 --> 0:2:11,64
It's a really, really
supple car.


49
0:2:11,64 --> 0:2:12,59
It's got wheel travel.


50
0:2:12,59 --> 0:2:13,715
It rolls a bit.


51
0:2:13,715 --> 0:2:15,2
It's just pleasant to be in.


52
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:19,8
Not once have I cursed any kind
of harshness in this car.


53
0:2:19,8 --> 0:2:23,16
For its intended role, going
flat out and fast on motorways


54
0:2:23,16 --> 0:2:25,98
and demolishing A roads,
it's brilliant.


55
0:2:25,98 --> 0:2:27,22
Ignore the dynamic mode.


56
0:2:27,22 --> 0:2:30,46
If I put it in dynamic mode now,
the camera would fall off


57
0:2:30,46 --> 0:2:30,855
the windscreen.


58
0:2:30,855 --> 0:2:32,7
It's that bad.


59
0:2:32,7 --> 0:2:36,14
Ignore the heavy, sporty
steering setting as well.


60
0:2:36,14 --> 0:2:38,64
What you want to do is put the
whole thing in comfort, long


61
0:2:38,64 --> 0:2:41,85
throttle, nice and slow, and
make sure that you've got the


62
0:2:41,85 --> 0:2:43,29
dampers in soft.


63
0:2:43,29 --> 0:2:44,832
Then you're just
happy, really.


64
0:2:44,832 --> 0:2:47,38
You could make the engine a bit
noisy if you want to, but


65
0:2:47,38 --> 0:2:50,7
that's kind of showing
off, isn't it.


66
0:2:50,7 --> 0:2:52,41
What else do I like
about this car?


67
0:2:52,41 --> 0:2:54,3
The powertrain--


68
0:2:54,3 --> 0:2:58,12
twin turbo V8s with this ZF
8-speed gearbox are always


69
0:2:58,12 --> 0:2:59,21
going to be a bit handy.


70
0:2:59,21 --> 0:3:2,55
But this is just borderline
genius.


71
0:3:2,55 --> 0:3:4,89
It is lacking some personality,
though.


72
0:3:4,89 --> 0:3:5,75
It's quite quiet.


73
0:3:5,75 --> 0:3:8,83
It seems that things have been
ramped back a bit with this


74
0:3:8,83 --> 0:3:9,92
generation of Audis.


75
0:3:9,92 --> 0:3:11,82
At times, you're not even
aware that it's a V8.


76
0:3:11,82 --> 0:3:13,51
It starts up with a
nice "woofle" as


77
0:3:13,51 --> 0:3:14,73
you probably heard.


78
0:3:14,73 --> 0:3:16,43
But otherwise, it can be mute.


79
0:3:16,43 --> 0:3:21,49
Under full load, it's got a sort
of hot, planey, V8, hard


80
0:3:21,49 --> 0:3:25,555
blare noise, which is good fun,
but nothing that special.


81
0:3:25,555 --> 0:3:27,36
Now I just like the package.


82
0:3:27,36 --> 0:3:28,93
I love the way it looks.


83
0:3:28,93 --> 0:3:31,32
I think it's brutal from
the front end.


84
0:3:31,32 --> 0:3:33,74
It's got so much presence.


85
0:3:33,74 --> 0:3:34,36
I like the cabin.


86
0:3:34,36 --> 0:3:36,99
I don't find it as intuitive
as the Mercedes.


87
0:3:36,99 --> 0:3:38,67
But it's still a great
place to sit,


88
0:3:38,67 --> 0:3:39,5
and it feels so special.


89
0:3:39,5 --> 0:3:42,93
The seats are superb,
supportive, comfortable.


90
0:3:42,93 --> 0:3:43,98
It's roomy.


91
0:3:43,98 --> 0:3:46,87
Not quite as big as the
Mercedes, strangely, but


92
0:3:46,87 --> 0:3:48,86
still, it's practical.


93
0:3:48,86 --> 0:3:53,37
It's just so many things to so
many potential buyers, if they


94
0:3:53,37 --> 0:3:54,8
have the money.


95
0:3:54,8 --> 0:3:57,41
70-liter fuel tank-- that's
a bit mean in my book.


96
0:3:57,41 --> 0:3:59,76
It could be a little
bit bigger.


97
0:3:59,76 --> 0:4:2,49
And fuel economy is
not brilliant.


98
0:4:2,49 --> 0:4:5,58
On a fast run, I'm doing
17 to the gallon.


99
0:4:5,58 --> 0:4:8,18
On a quickish run-- and let's
face it, you're never going to


100
0:4:8,18 --> 0:4:11,62
travel anything less than
quickish in this car--


101
0:4:11,62 --> 0:4:14,142
it's about 19 to 20, whereas
the Merc can


102
0:4:14,142 --> 0:4:15,7
stretch it up to 25.


103
0:4:15,7 --> 0:4:19,1
But do you buy one of these
things for fuel economy?


104
0:4:19,1 --> 0:4:22,28
No, you probably don't.


105
0:4:22,28 --> 0:4:27,15
The RS6 is a great, fast Audi.


106
0:4:27,15 --> 0:4:28,45
It is--


107
0:4:28,45 --> 0:4:30,6
leaving the R8 to one
side for a minute--


108
0:4:30,6 --> 0:4:33,32
the best car that
Audi RS makes.


109
0:4:33,32 --> 0:4:37,74
It's miles better than the new
RS4 And don't believe anyone


110
0:4:37,74 --> 0:4:40,24
who says otherwise.


111
0:4:40,24 --> 0:4:43,29
The new RS6 ditches the old V10
motor and uses a 4-liter


112
0:4:43,29 --> 0:4:48,0
twin turbo V8 to give 560
horsepower and 516


113
0:4:48,0 --> 0:4:48,8
foot-pounds.


114
0:4:48,8 --> 0:4:52,29
At a cruise, it can deactivate
four of those cylinders, too.


115
0:4:52,29 --> 0:4:54,83
Claimed curb weight is just over
2 tons, which is lighter


116
0:4:54,83 --> 0:4:56,11
than before.


117
0:4:56,11 --> 0:4:58,64
It also uses ZF's amazing
8-speed auto.


118
0:4:58,64 --> 0:5:0,71
And this car is fitted with the
dynamic pack, which gives


119
0:5:0,71 --> 0:5:3,71
steel springs and adjustable
dampers, and raises the top


120
0:5:3,71 --> 0:5:7,59
speed to 174 miles an hour.


121
0:5:7,59 --> 0:5:11,8
Now let's face it, no one does
hard-as-nails wagon styling


122
0:5:11,8 --> 0:5:12,3
like Audi--


123
0:5:12,3 --> 0:5:15,55
flared arches, massive,
optional 21-inch rims,


124
0:5:15,55 --> 0:5:18,93
satin-finished aluminum, and
"quattro" stamped on the front


125
0:5:18,93 --> 0:5:21,18
grill to scare the 911
in front of you.


126
0:5:21,18 --> 0:5:24,2
Yes, you pay extra
for that, too.


127
0:5:24,2 --> 0:5:27,7
The base price of the RS6
is 75,500 pounds.


128
0:5:27,7 --> 0:5:29,74
But even with a light smattering
of extras, this


129
0:5:29,74 --> 0:5:33,63
test car cost 90,565 quid--


130
0:5:33,63 --> 0:5:35,19
for an estate car.


131
0:5:35,19 --> 0:5:36,75
You do get the fancy sport


132
0:5:36,75 --> 0:5:38,315
rear-differential for free, though.


133
0:5:38,315 --> 0:5:39,565
So that's all right.


134
0:5:39,565 --> 0:5:44,39



135
0:5:44,39 --> 0:5:47,41
I make no secret of the fact
that I'm living with this CLS


136
0:5:47,41 --> 0:5:48,2
for a year.


137
0:5:48,2 --> 0:5:51,64
It's not my car, but I use
it every single day.


138
0:5:51,64 --> 0:5:53,36
So I'm more connected to it.


139
0:5:53,36 --> 0:5:56,99
I obviously find its controls
a bit more user friendly.


140
0:5:56,99 --> 0:5:58,54
I find everything
a bit easier.


141
0:5:58,54 --> 0:6:0,77
But even if I didn't live with
it every day, I'd think the


142
0:6:0,77 --> 0:6:4,65
cabin was more logical than
the one in the Audi.


143
0:6:4,65 --> 0:6:8,0
The dynamics of these cars
are very interesting.


144
0:6:8,0 --> 0:6:9,85
They really are very
similar on paper.


145
0:6:9,85 --> 0:6:12,55
Quite how Audi managed to
squeeze so much torque from a


146
0:6:12,55 --> 0:6:15,655
4-liter twin-turbo motor,
whereas Mercedes needs 5.5


147
0:6:15,655 --> 0:6:18,2
liters to go a little bit
further, I don't know.


148
0:6:18,2 --> 0:6:21,2
I suspect that this engine could
go quite a bit further


149
0:6:21,2 --> 0:6:22,59
if they wanted it to.


150
0:6:22,59 --> 0:6:23,35
On the road?


151
0:6:23,35 --> 0:6:26,32
Well, in terms of torque, this
has more of it, and feels


152
0:6:26,32 --> 0:6:27,792
gruntier low down.


153
0:6:27,792 --> 0:6:29,27
But I'll cut to the chase.


154
0:6:29,27 --> 0:6:33,84
The difference between the two
cars is in the transmission.


155
0:6:33,84 --> 0:6:35,86
Whereas the Mercedes feels it
has to wait a little bit


156
0:6:35,86 --> 0:6:38,935
longer to find the next gear, or
drop one, or go up one, and


157
0:6:38,935 --> 0:6:42,59
find where the torque is,
the Audi just goes.


158
0:6:42,59 --> 0:6:43,82
The Audi just flies.


159
0:6:43,82 --> 0:6:44,83
It's insane.


160
0:6:44,83 --> 0:6:46,52
It feels faster on the road.


161
0:6:46,52 --> 0:6:51,25
And this car already, to
me, feels loopy fast.


162
0:6:51,25 --> 0:6:52,82
But the Merc has the upper
hand in several


163
0:6:52,82 --> 0:6:53,95
areas on the road.


164
0:6:53,95 --> 0:6:55,37
It feels much more agile.


165
0:6:55,37 --> 0:6:57,35
The steering's got a lot
more life to it.


166
0:6:57,35 --> 0:6:58,83
In fact, the whole
powertrain has.


167
0:6:58,83 --> 0:7:0,8
If you like music,
this makes it.


168
0:7:0,8 --> 0:7:3,212
Whereas the Audi in the debate,
this thing just sounds


169
0:7:3,212 --> 0:7:4,44
like a muscle car.


170
0:7:4,44 --> 0:7:5,27
It's a monster.


171
0:7:5,27 --> 0:7:7,51
When you start it up,
you just giggle.


172
0:7:7,51 --> 0:7:9,53
When you leave it in stop-start
mode, well, that's


173
0:7:9,53 --> 0:7:11,36
fantastic, because it
keeps restarting.


174
0:7:11,36 --> 0:7:14,2
And you get that incredible
ra-ra-ra-ra noise


175
0:7:14,2 --> 0:7:16,42
when it gets going.


176
0:7:16,42 --> 0:7:17,72
I love driving it.


177
0:7:17,72 --> 0:7:19,72
It has its limitations,
though, because


178
0:7:19,72 --> 0:7:22,11
it's two-wheel drive.


179
0:7:22,11 --> 0:7:25,36
This is probably the core
problem for people who buy


180
0:7:25,36 --> 0:7:26,13
cars like this.


181
0:7:26,13 --> 0:7:28,23
Do you go for the crazy
[INAUDIBLE] two-wheel drive


182
0:7:28,23 --> 0:7:30,4
Mercedes, and do sideways
everywhere?


183
0:7:30,4 --> 0:7:33,275
Not really applicable
in normal driving.


184
0:7:33,275 --> 0:7:35,45
Or do you get the Audi, which is
going to be just as quick,


185
0:7:35,45 --> 0:7:37,3
come rain or shine?


186
0:7:37,3 --> 0:7:39,82
It rained for one day when
we had these two cars.


187
0:7:39,82 --> 0:7:42,15
And frankly, the Mercedes
couldn't see where


188
0:7:42,15 --> 0:7:43,6
the Audi had gone.


189
0:7:43,6 --> 0:7:46,51
But the person driving the
Mercedes was smiling more.


190
0:7:46,51 --> 0:7:50,81
Now, I could use that argument
to, perhaps, create a


191
0:7:50,81 --> 0:7:53,8
situation where a sports car
might be better because it was


192
0:7:53,8 --> 0:7:55,76
two-wheel drive rather than
four-wheel drive.


193
0:7:55,76 --> 0:7:58,52
But in the world of super
estate cars, I


194
0:7:58,52 --> 0:7:59,51
struggle with that.


195
0:7:59,51 --> 0:8:0,8
I struggle.


196
0:8:0,8 --> 0:8:1,32
I know Mercedes are bringing
four-wheel


197
0:8:1,32 --> 0:8:2,47
drive cars on stream.


198
0:8:2,47 --> 0:8:7,14
But at the moment, I can only
judge what we've got.


199
0:8:7,14 --> 0:8:9,1
I do love driving this
thing, though.


200
0:8:9,1 --> 0:8:10,6
And it is more direct.


201
0:8:10,6 --> 0:8:11,83
It has better steering.


202
0:8:11,83 --> 0:8:13,5
It has better brake feel.


203
0:8:13,5 --> 0:8:17,53
Everything about it feels
that little bit tighter.


204
0:8:17,53 --> 0:8:20,47
But it doesn't have the
transmission or that kind of


205
0:8:20,47 --> 0:8:22,77
eye-opening performance that
you get from the Audi.


206
0:8:22,77 --> 0:8:25,18
A little bit further ride, when
I've got it in comfort,


207
0:8:25,18 --> 0:8:25,63
than the Audi.


208
0:8:25,63 --> 0:8:28,7
But there's two extra damper
settings here.


209
0:8:28,7 --> 0:8:31,2
And frankly, they're better
judged than the Audi extra


210
0:8:31,2 --> 0:8:31,8
damping settings.


211
0:8:31,8 --> 0:8:33,76
But for me, I never
drive this car in


212
0:8:33,76 --> 0:8:35,39
anything other than comfort.


213
0:8:35,39 --> 0:8:40,73



214
0:8:40,73 --> 0:8:42,86
The base price of the Shooting
Brake is even higher--


215
0:8:42,86 --> 0:8:44,79
over 83 grand.


216
0:8:44,79 --> 0:8:47,54
And this one lists
at over 97,000.


217
0:8:47,54 --> 0:8:49,75
There's no power kit
option on this AMG.


218
0:8:49,75 --> 0:8:54,45
You get your 557 horsepower and
590 foot-pounds for free.


219
0:8:54,45 --> 0:8:57,2
But the locking rear
differential, it's 2 and 1/2


220
0:8:57,2 --> 0:8:59,8
grand-- for a diff.


221
0:8:59,8 --> 0:8:59,72
But you know what?


222
0:8:59,72 --> 0:9:2,59
The CLS feels way more
expensive inside.


223
0:9:2,59 --> 0:9:5,22
Everything is covered in soft,
waxy, expensive smelling


224
0:9:5,22 --> 0:9:7,87
leather, where the Audi
has dark plastics.


225
0:9:7,87 --> 0:9:9,9
You can't ignore the
RS6's gorgeous


226
0:9:9,9 --> 0:9:11,15
quilted seats, though.


227
0:9:11,15 --> 0:9:14,53
And I love the way the dials
greet you on a dark morning.


228
0:9:14,53 --> 0:9:17,32
The AMG counters with lighting
you can change


229
0:9:17,32 --> 0:9:20,2
according to your mood.


230
0:9:20,2 --> 0:9:22,64
These are both cabins you'd
happily spend whole days


231
0:9:22,64 --> 0:9:24,41
roaming about a continent in.


232
0:9:24,41 --> 0:9:27,65
Big, comfortable, spacious,
they are all the car you


233
0:9:27,65 --> 0:9:28,97
should ever need.


234
0:9:28,97 --> 0:9:32,444
They're not about raw
speed, are they?


235
0:9:32,444 --> 0:9:34,23
Well, they kind of are now,
these are super estates,


236
0:9:34,23 --> 0:9:35,6
aren't they?


237
0:9:35,6 --> 0:9:37,38
So we need to drag race them.


238
0:9:37,38 --> 0:9:40,77
Here, we have over 1,100
horsepower, space for 10


239
0:9:40,77 --> 0:9:43,14
adults and four Labradors.


240
0:9:43,14 --> 0:9:46,45
What happens next is a
little eye-opening.


241
0:9:46,45 --> 0:9:48,55
The Audi, quite understandably,
beats the Merc


242
0:9:48,55 --> 0:9:50,72
off the line, because it
has four driven wheels.


243
0:9:50,72 --> 0:9:53,76
But the margin, on paper, isn't
as bad as you'd think.


244
0:9:53,76 --> 0:9:56,89
Just remember that the car being
left behind here hits 60


245
0:9:56,89 --> 0:9:59,54
miles an hour in 4.2 seconds.


246
0:9:59,54 --> 0:10:3,98
The Audi does it in a scarcely
believable 3.9 seconds.


247
0:10:3,98 --> 0:10:6,18
Just imagine what the
transmission is going through


248
0:10:6,18 --> 0:10:11,31
to make a two-ton, four-wheel
drive estate do 60 in 3.9


249
0:10:11,31 --> 0:10:13,21
But this is the bit that
blows my mind.


250
0:10:13,21 --> 0:10:15,76
The Audi keeps pulling away.


251
0:10:15,76 --> 0:10:18,4
From 60 to 100 miles an
hour, it pulls another


252
0:10:18,4 --> 0:10:19,95
4/10 from the Merc.


253
0:10:19,95 --> 0:10:21,56
There's no traction
advantage now.


254
0:10:21,56 --> 0:10:23,85
It's nearly 70 foot-pounds
down on torque,


255
0:10:23,85 --> 0:10:25,64
and it weighs more.


256
0:10:25,64 --> 0:10:26,67
And you can thank the


257
0:10:26,67 --> 0:10:28,97
transmission for the dominance.


258
0:10:28,97 --> 0:10:30,64
The shifts are miles faster.


259
0:10:30,64 --> 0:10:32,77
The extra ratio means
even better use


260
0:10:32,77 --> 0:10:33,69
of the power available.


261
0:10:33,69 --> 0:10:37,27
And the RS6 beats the
AMG hands down.


262
0:10:37,27 --> 0:10:40,21
Only when they get above 100
does the CLS hold station.


263
0:10:40,21 --> 0:10:43,695
But by that time, the
Audi is gone.

0:10:56,565 --> 0:11:4,52



268
0:11:4,52 --> 0:11:8,54
I really don't understand
Audi RS as a company.


269
0:11:8,54 --> 0:11:10,92
Their work is so variable.


270
0:11:10,92 --> 0:11:14,33
Last year, I had the
disappointment of the RS4.


271
0:11:14,33 --> 0:11:18,41
Now I kind of have the ecstasy
of this RS6 unit which I think


272
0:11:18,41 --> 0:11:21,4
is a fantastic motor car.


273
0:11:21,4 --> 0:11:25,59
Objectively, it's better
than my beloved CLS.


274
0:11:25,59 --> 0:11:27,345
It puts its power on
the road better.


275
0:11:27,345 --> 0:11:30,17
It's nearly as much
fun to drive.


276
0:11:30,17 --> 0:11:32,49
And its gearbox is the
telling component.


277
0:11:32,49 --> 0:11:35,16
That ZF 8-speed is a genius
transmission.


278
0:11:35,16 --> 0:11:39,36
And it really shows up the old
seven speeder in the Merc now.


279
0:11:39,36 --> 0:11:40,86
It also looks fantastic.


280
0:11:40,86 --> 0:11:41,88
It's great to be in.


281
0:11:41,88 --> 0:11:47,3
And on these steel springs and
with these special dampers, in


282
0:11:47,3 --> 0:11:49,735
comfort mode, it's nice to drive
on the road in the UK as


283
0:11:49,735 --> 0:11:51,93
well, unexpectedly so.


284
0:11:51,93 --> 0:11:55,8
The RS4 used to be the choice
of the fast Audi estates for


285
0:11:55,8 --> 0:11:56,99
the person that enjoys
driving.


286
0:11:56,99 --> 0:11:59,66
I think this car completely
reverses that.


287
0:11:59,66 --> 0:12:3,16
So where does that leave the
lovely CLS Shooting Brake?


288
0:12:3,16 --> 0:12:5,69
It's a car of immense character,
I think more


289
0:12:5,69 --> 0:12:7,52
character than this vehicle.


290
0:12:7,52 --> 0:12:11,33
It's like a muscle car, but
with art deco overtones.


291
0:12:11,33 --> 0:12:12,5
I love the style.


292
0:12:12,5 --> 0:12:13,63
I love the way it dries.


293
0:12:13,63 --> 0:12:15,34
It has a nicer steering.

are preferable.

the better car.
