It's Darwin's birthday this Saturday, so -
Happy Birthday Darwin. I'm sorry, you


17
0:1:24,38 --> 0:1:27,11
probably won't like the present I'm giving
you.


18
0:1:27,11 --> 0:1:34,3
Back in the 1930's, an unusual report of
fossil human footprints surfaced.  These


19
0:1:34,3 --> 0:1:37,47
fossil human footprints were in
Carboniferous rock, near Berea,


20
0:1:37,47 --> 0:1:41,26
Kentucky, and were examined by Dr.
Burroughs who founded the geology


21
0:1:41,26 --> 0:1:45,84
department at Berea college.  Creationists
had talked about these tracks for many


22
0:1:45,84 --> 0:1:51,29
years, and I managed to obtain a copy of
the reference: A Scientific American paper


23
0:1:51,29 --> 0:1:57,37
from January 1940.  I took one look at the
pictures, and said "Nope, those are


24
0:1:57,37 --> 0:2:2,73
carvings, not fossil tracks."  It turns out I
wasn't the only one who did this.


25
0:2:2,73 --> 0:2:6,75
Talkorigins and Glen Kuban both show
these photos on their websites,


26
0:2:6,75 --> 0:2:11,1
badarchaeology refers to the SciAm
article, and Institute for Biblical and


27
0:2:11,1 --> 0:2:15,88
Scientific Studies also refers to the SciAm
article in mocking disdain towards the


28
0:2:15,88 --> 0:2:20,58
creationary claim of fossil human
footprints in Carboniferous rocks.


29
0:2:20,58 --> 0:2:24,75
In fact, the Scientific American article is
the source of the quote that so many a


30
0:2:24,75 --> 0:2:54,1
creationist has cited:


31
0:2:54,1 --> 0:2:59,78
David Willis, of Indianapolis had contacted
myself, as he wanted to go investigate the


32
0:2:59,78 --> 0:3:4,21
Berea tracks, as well as an alleged fossil
human footprint that had recently come to


33
0:3:4,21 --> 0:3:9,23
light in Tennessee. I was in Ohio at the
time, so we ventured down together.  We


34
0:3:9,23 --> 0:3:12,67
spent the day in the archives at Berea
college and found a copy of the SciAm


35
0:3:12,67 --> 0:3:19,14
article in Professor Burrough's archives,
and thus got our first shock of the day.


36
0:3:19,14 --> 0:3:24,77
The photographs presented in the SciAm
article were not the Berean fossil


37
0:3:24,77 --> 0:3:30,98
footprints!  In fact, if you read Ingall's
article carefully, you can read between


38
0:3:30,98 --> 0:3:35,37
the lines and note that he never did say
the tracks pictured were the Berean


39
0:3:35,37 --> 0:3:41,35
tracks - though the Berean tracks were
the focus of discussion in the article.


40
0:3:41,35 --> 0:3:46,22
Ingall's article can only be described as
scandalous, but the scandal didn't stop


41
0:3:46,22 --> 0:3:50,66
there: A second article published by the
Christian Science Monitor showed two


42
0:3:50,66 --> 0:3:55,2
photographs, neither of which were
photographs of the Berean fossil human


43
0:3:55,2 --> 0:3:59,13
footprints.  The upper photograph was a
pencil rubbing of a pair of the Berean


44
0:3:59,13 --> 0:4:3,52
footprints, which the monitor claimed was
oily stains left over from molding the


45
0:4:3,52 --> 0:4:9,17
tracks, and the lower photograph was
fossil amphibian tracks from some


46
0:4:9,17 --> 0:4:13,73
unknown location.  Burroughs himself
noted in his personal correspondence


47
0:4:13,73 --> 0:4:18,62
that the Monitor even went to the trouble
of displaying only ten tracks in the


48
0:4:18,62 --> 0:4:25,5
amphibian ichnofossil slab - which "just
happened" to match the number of prints


49
0:4:25,5 --> 0:4:27,89
found at the Berean site!


50
0:4:27,89 --> 0:4:31,96
It's being gracious to chalk all of this up
to bad journalism.  A more accurate


51
0:4:31,96 --> 0:4:36,78
description would probably be fraudulent,
deliberately misleading reporting.


52
0:4:36,78 --> 0:4:42,13
So just what was the evidence then? Why
is it that although both Scientific


53
0:4:42,13 --> 0:4:46,14
American and the Christian Science
Monitor had access to photographs of the


54
0:4:46,14 --> 0:4:50,7
actual fossil footprints at Berea, they
instead showed photographs of what


55
0:4:50,7 --> 0:4:57,0
were obviously Indian carvings and
amphibian fossil footprints?  Why did both


56
0:4:57,0 --> 0:5:2,6
SciAm and the Monitor both then
interview "experts" and get their opinions


57
0:5:2,6 --> 0:5:7,68
on photographs of Indian carvings and
fossil footprints that were NOT the


58
0:5:7,68 --> 0:5:12,62
Berean fossil footprints?
David and I both obtained wax castings of


59
0:5:12,62 --> 0:5:18,33
the fossil footprints, as the originals were
all cut out of the rock.  Much to my


60
0:5:18,33 --> 0:5:24,86
surprise, they were genuine fossil human
footprints.  There is clear displaced mud


61
0:5:24,86 --> 0:5:29,45
surrounding the footprints, and multiple
researchers noted the increased density


62
0:5:29,45 --> 0:5:33,6
in the sand grains surrounding the
footprints, verifying that they were


63
0:5:33,6 --> 0:5:39,43
genuine footprints.  The footprints are
clearly human as there is no creature -


64
0:5:39,43 --> 0:5:44,51
fossil or living, that makes a footprint like
a human, and there is no doubt the rock


65
0:5:44,51 --> 0:5:49,6
is assigned the evolutionary age of 250
million years old.


66
0:5:49,6 --> 0:5:53,84
So why does it matter?
Although Richard Dawkins was referring


67
0:5:53,84 --> 0:5:57,97
to alleged fossil human bones in the
Carboniferous, his point remains the


68
0:5:57,97 --> 0:6:3,58
same: Evidence of humans in the
Carboniferous would "...blow the theory


69
0:6:3,58 --> 0:6:8,98
of evolution out of the water." These
footprints are only one of many pieces of


70
0:6:8,98 --> 0:6:13,54
evidence of humans in the Carboniferous,
and shows that, exactly as the Biblical


71
0:6:13,54 --> 0:6:19,1
account of Creation points out, man has
been around since the beginning of time.


72
0:6:19,1 --> 0:6:23,96
These casts are now a part of my new
"Fossil human footprints" exhibit which


73
0:6:23,96 --> 0:6:28,71
will be going on display this spring.  I will
be detailing the Berean fossil footprints in


74
0:6:28,71 --> 0:6:32,15
the current issue of CORE Ottawa's
CrEvo news, which should be coming out


75
0:6:32,15 --> 0:6:37,63
any day now, you can sign up for the
newsletter here:


76
0:6:37,63 --> 0:6:42,28
Science Daily carried a report about the
successful sequencing of the DNA of a


77
0:6:42,28 --> 0:6:46,94
relative of the Neanderthals.  Called
Denisovan, these peoples are supposed


78
0:6:46,94 --> 0:6:50,89
to be a representative of an Asian group
of extinct humans related to the


79
0:6:50,89 --> 0:6:55,37
Neanderthals.  Taking samples from a
finger bone found in a cave in Southern


80
0:6:55,37 --> 0:7:0,89
Siberia in 2008, the Max Planck Institute
for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig,


81
0:7:0,89 --> 0:7:5,85
Germany, funded the DNA sequencing
research.  The sequence was made public


82
0:7:5,85 --> 0:7:10,23
yesterday, and is available on the web
here:


83
0:7:10,23 --> 0:7:15,62
This is not the first time DNA sampling
has been performed on a person so "old."


84
0:7:15,62 --> 0:7:20,33
In fact, Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA
has already been compared to humans.


85
0:7:20,33 --> 0:7:24,19
Sean Pitmann Hey contrasted the
differences between a few sample


86
0:7:24,19 --> 0:7:27,97
humans and the Neanderthals, and
showed that the Neanderthals had less


87
0:7:27,97 --> 0:7:34,6
difference with humans than humans did
with each other!  To put it in crude form,


88
0:7:34,6 --> 0:7:38,22
Neanderthals were more human than
humans were.


89
0:7:38,22 --> 0:7:42,7
So we look forward to the comparisons
that will arise from this newly sequenced


90
0:7:42,7 --> 0:7:47,5
DNA!  The point to be made here is not the
comparisons that can be made, but rather


91
0:7:47,5 --> 0:7:54,0
the fact that the Leipzig group was even
able to sequence DNA that is allegedly so


92
0:7:54,0 --> 0:8:2,14
old!  The estimates are that this finger
bone was 30,000 to 50,000 years old!  This


93
0:8:2,14 --> 0:8:7,39
is already clearly outside of the Biblical
timeline, so if the bone really is that old, it


94
0:8:7,39 --> 0:8:12,8
causes huge problems for Biblical
Creationists.  Is the bone really that old? 


95
0:8:12,8 --> 0:8:18,2
Scientific study would refute such an
idea. We've all seen the CSI TV shows,


96
0:8:18,2 --> 0:8:22,85
which has popularized forensic science.
Forensic research is such solid science


97
0:8:22,85 --> 0:8:29,48
that it stands up in a court of law!  People
are jailed and executed on the basis of


98
0:8:29,48 --> 0:8:33,83
forensic evidence - thats' how solid the
science is.  Of course, there is much


99
0:8:33,83 --> 0:8:38,73
interest in the deterioration rates of DNA
in forensic research.  And such research


100
0:8:38,73 --> 0:8:45,13
has shown over and over again that DNA
just simply cannot last for tens of


101
0:8:45,13 --> 0:8:50,39
thousands of years!  
Denisova cave is in a temperate climate -


102
0:8:50,39 --> 0:8:54,89
about the same elevation and latitude as
Drumheller, Alberta, Canada.


103
0:8:54,89 --> 0:8:59,25
Dr. Daniel Criswell discussed the
technical details of the rapid deterioration


104
0:8:59,25 --> 0:9:3,71
of DNA in the Spring 2009 issue of
Creation Research Society Quarterly


105
0:9:3,71 --> 0:9:8,24
article "Neandertal DNA and Modern
Humans." The worst thing for


106
0:9:8,24 --> 0:9:12,76
deteriorating DNA is moisture, and
warmth - two things that caves are well


107
0:9:12,76 --> 0:9:26,41
known for!  
As Criswell pointed out:


108
0:9:26,41 --> 0:9:30,95
In other words - forget about an entire
DNA strand being preserved! The most


109
0:9:30,95 --> 0:9:36,2
you can hope for is small fragments of
DNA sticking together for maybe 10,000


110
0:9:36,2 --> 0:9:37,76
years.


111
0:9:37,76 --> 0:9:42,96
Dr. Theodore Siek, writing in the
May/June 2010 issue of Creation Matters,


112
0:9:42,96 --> 0:9:58,48
also discussed why DNA breaks down so
quickly.  In the words of Dr. Seik:


113
0:9:58,48 --> 0:10:4,11
Not only is the Denisovan DNA
recognizable - apparently the scientists


114
0:10:4,11 --> 0:10:9,8
were able to sequence the entire thing!
The remarkable preservation of the DNA


115
0:10:9,8 --> 0:10:14,33
provides excellent evidence that this
fossil finger is much, much younger than


116
0:10:14,33 --> 0:10:17,88
the evolutionists are proposing.


117
0:10:17,88 --> 0:10:23,2
[scary, dramatic music]


118
0:10:23,2 --> 0:10:26,4
Wahoo! Mail for me?


119
0:10:26,4 --> 0:10:34,28
[sound of a geiger counter detecting a lot
of radiation]


120
0:10:34,28 --> 0:10:36,93
Hmmmm... I wonder what it tastes like?


121
0:10:36,93 --> 0:10:39,55
[sounds of someone drinking]


122
0:10:39,55 --> 0:10:44,38
[scary, dramatic music]


123
0:10:44,38 --> 0:12:23,7
Dr. Aaron Judkins wrote in regarding last
week's show:


124
0:12:23,7 --> 0:12:43,18
Ironman left a comment regarding the
alleged evolving virus in the last episode:


125
0:12:43,18 --> 0:12:48,95
Really? So evolution explains how the fig
tree survived for millions of years before


126
0:12:48,95 --> 0:12:54,2
the fig wasp evolved?  Even though the fig
wasp needs the fig tree to survive, and


127
0:12:54,2 --> 0:12:59,23
the fig tree needs the fig wasp to survive?
I could cite probably dozens of examples


128
0:12:59,23 --> 0:13:5,8
like that.  Scientists weren't around 17,000
years ago - and scientists TODAY have


129
0:13:5,8 --> 0:13:10,77
not figured out this "co-evolution", so
obviously it isn't written in biology


130
0:13:10,77 --> 0:13:44,78
textbooks.


131
0:13:44,78 --> 0:13:50,11
Actually, when I have asked evolutionists
to define evolution, THAT is the definition


132
0:13:50,11 --> 0:13:53,31
I have been given. So you're not
disagreeing with me, nor is this


133
0:13:53,31 --> 0:13:57,48
misrepresentation.  I would encourage the
viewers to do their own survey - go


134
0:13:57,48 --> 0:14:2,6
around and ask people what their
definition of evolution is.  Go on!


135
0:14:2,6 --> 0:14:12,4
PaulChartley finished his statement with:
.


136
0:14:12,4 --> 0:14:16,78
Thank you for admitting that evolution fits
every scenario - that immediately


137
0:14:16,78 --> 0:14:22,8
disqualifies evolution as scientific,
because it is then not falsifiable.


138
0:14:22,8 --> 0:14:26,61
Evolution simply conforms to whatever
evidence it is presented with.  Thank you


139
0:14:26,61 --> 0:14:57,87
for making my point.


140
0:14:57,87 --> 0:15:13,98
A significant point, thanks for writing in.


141
0:15:13,98 --> 0:15:19,42
Well let's deal with that right now: First of
all it is astoundingly ignorant to claim


142
0:15:19,42 --> 0:15:23,3
there are no creationists with science
degrees.  They have already disqualified


143
0:15:23,3 --> 0:15:27,8
themselves with that one claim alone.
But I am also immediately suspect of


144
0:15:27,8 --> 0:15:34,23
anyone who starts asking about
credentials - why? Because credentials


145
0:15:34,23 --> 0:15:40,5
have absolutely nothing to do with
whether or not the person is right. That is


146
0:15:40,5 --> 0:15:44,42
a subtle ad-hominem attack.
Credentialed people make stupid


147
0:15:44,42 --> 0:15:49,21
mistakes, and uncredentialed people
make stunning discoveries.  Secondly,


148
0:15:49,21 --> 0:15:53,58
you'll please notice that such people who
ask for credentials use the lack of


149
0:15:53,58 --> 0:15:58,5
credentials to reject anything you say, but
then embrace the writings of Darwin -


150
0:15:58,5 --> 0:16:2,12
who's only earned degree was in
theology.  


151
0:16:2,12 --> 0:16:5,93
Now if you have scientific credentials,
they reject your credentials.  Dr. Jerry


152
0:16:5,93 --> 0:16:11,78
Bergman- 9 degrees, two of them PHd's -
you don't get more credentialed than that,


153
0:16:11,78 --> 0:16:16,17
but the very people who were demanding
my credentials in the very next sentence


154
0:16:16,17 --> 0:16:21,18
were rejecting Dr. Bergman's credentials.
There's no nice way to say it - this is


155
0:16:21,18 --> 0:16:25,7
called hypocrisy and bigotry, and it was
glaring in the comments of last week's


156
0:16:25,7 --> 0:16:29,83
show - I encourage the viewers - go read
the comments for yourself.


157
0:16:29,83 --> 0:16:34,4
In like fashion, the anti-creationists loudly
demand peer review - but they seem to


158
0:16:34,4 --> 0:16:38,22
forget that "Origin of the species" was
never peer reviewed.  The only peer review


159
0:16:38,22 --> 0:16:42,43
they will accept is peer review which
defends evolution and refutes creation -


160
0:16:42,43 --> 0:16:47,1
therefore by their twisted definition, there
are no Creationary peer reviewed papers.


161
0:16:47,1 --> 0:16:52,9
Actually, in fact there's been plenty of
creationists who have published articles


162
0:16:52,9 --> 0:16:58,3
in secular peer reviewed journals - but the
anti-creationists reject those works.  


163
0:16:58,3 --> 0:17:4,24
Obviously - the anti-creationists areare
playing head games. Ask yourself: Would


164
0:17:4,24 --> 0:17:8,31
you listen to someone who contradicts
themselves like that?  Hypocrites and


165
0:17:8,31 --> 0:17:12,75
bigots disqualify themselves from any
semblance of credibility. They are not


166
0:17:12,75 --> 0:17:17,8
reasonable, nor are they worthy of being
listened to. I have addressed these issues


167
0:17:17,8 --> 0:17:51,11
partly in my newsletters, item #3 here,
and partly in CrEvo Rant #213


168
0:17:51,11 --> 0:17:55,38
Let me see what I can do - I'm way behind
in video production, as I've got several


169
0:17:55,38 --> 0:17:59,35
videos in queue which need to be
produced first, but sure - that is a fun


170
0:17:59,35 --> 0:18:3,35
subject, and again, forensic science has
much to say on the matter.


171
0:18:3,35 --> 0:18:7,35
Okay - that's enough for this week, I'm
your host Ian Juby.  Thanks for watching


172
0:18:7,35 --> 0:18:12,38
and pursuing the truth with me - just
remember - Pilate asked "What is Truth?"


173
0:18:12,38 --> 0:18:17,65
Jesus said "I am Truth" - we'll see you
next Thursday.


174
