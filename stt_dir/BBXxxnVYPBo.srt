Jekyll and Hyde day, because


209
0:9:2,69 --> 0:9:6,63
breakfast was the most official
Taiwanese breakfast


210
0:9:6,63 --> 0:9:7,39
I've ever had.


211
0:9:7,39 --> 0:9:10,18
Like, everything there
was on smash.


212
0:9:10,18 --> 0:9:13,54
And I even liked when the chef
punched our cameraman in the


213
0:9:13,54 --> 0:9:15,91
face because he was protecting
his recipe.


214
0:9:15,91 --> 0:9:17,73
He didn't want people to see.


215
0:9:17,73 --> 0:9:19,18
Cosplay--


216
0:9:19,18 --> 0:9:20,54
yeah, cosplay was
a lot of fun.


217
0:9:20,54 --> 0:9:21,89
It's like going to Comic-Con.


218
0:9:21,89 --> 0:9:24,3
You look at it and you think
people are cornballs.


219
0:9:24,3 --> 0:9:27,27
Sometimes you got to be like not
so fucking cool and just


220
0:9:27,27 --> 0:9:29,43
have a good time, and
I had a great time.


221
0:9:29,43 --> 0:9:31,42
And that toilet restaurant,
same thing.


222
0:9:31,42 --> 0:9:33,52
It's not always about
what's in the


223
0:9:33,52 --> 0:9:36,15
toilet, it's the toilet.


224
0:9:36,15 --> 0:9:39,47
The whole experience of eating
out of toilets is some wild,


225
0:9:39,47 --> 0:9:41,91
funny shit, you know?


226
0:9:41,91 --> 0:9:45,28
This episode I think really
shows people don't judge a


227
0:9:45,28 --> 0:9:47,79
toilet by its cover.


228
0:9:47,79 --> 0:9:49,32
"Fresh Off the Boat," Taiwan.


229
0:9:49,32 --> 0:9:52,326
Eddie Huang, we out.


230
0:9:52,326 --> 0:9:56,964
On the next episode of
"Fresh Off the Boat."


231
0:9:56,964 --> 0:9:58,214
[SPEAKING CHINESE]


232
0:9:58,214 --> 0:10:4,58



233
0:10:4,58 --> 0:12:4,58
