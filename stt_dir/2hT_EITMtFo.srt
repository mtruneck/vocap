0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:7,7



2
0:0:7,7 --> 0:0:7,75
TRAVIE MCCOY: Salutations.


3
0:0:7,75 --> 0:0:11,4
I'm Travie McCoy, and I have
a crazy story for you.


4
0:0:11,4 --> 0:0:17,0
You see, we're a bunch of gutter
punks, and hip hop kids


5
0:0:17,0 --> 0:0:18,95
going to this frat party.


6
0:0:18,95 --> 0:0:21,725
From the moment that we walked
into the party, it was just--


7
0:0:21,725 --> 0:0:23,67
MALE SPEAKER: What the--


8
0:0:23,67 --> 0:0:25,79
TRAVIE MCCOY: You could
feel the tension.


9
0:0:25,79 --> 0:0:27,16
You could cut it with a knife.


10
0:0:27,16 --> 0:0:28,58
We definitely didn't
belong there.


11
0:0:28,58 --> 0:0:32,32
The first thing I do is dart
straight for the refrigerator.


12
0:0:32,32 --> 0:0:36,68
And there's all these colorful
jello shots that


13
0:0:36,68 --> 0:0:37,76
didn't belong to me.


14
0:0:37,76 --> 0:0:39,406
But in my head, they did.


15
0:0:39,406 --> 0:0:42,39
So I just started
destroying them.


16
0:0:42,39 --> 0:0:46,86
And all of a sudden, this girl
rushes in to the kitchen like,


17
0:0:46,86 --> 0:0:47,767
who the fuck are you?


18
0:0:47,767 --> 0:0:49,17
These are my jello shots.


19
0:0:49,17 --> 0:0:51,61
I spent all night making
them, blah, blah, blah.


20
0:0:51,61 --> 0:0:53,31
Proceeded to go upstairs.


21
0:0:53,31 --> 0:0:57,11
I remember speaking to this
girl, trying to woo her.


22
0:0:57,11 --> 0:0:59,8
The jello shots started
to kick in.


23
0:0:59,8 --> 0:1:0,58
I started sweating.


24
0:1:0,58 --> 0:1:6,31
The next thing you know, it was
just like this bomb pop of


25
0:1:6,31 --> 0:1:9,93
nastiness, which was the jello
shots flying out of


26
0:1:9,93 --> 0:1:11,27
my mouth onto her.


27
0:1:11,27 --> 0:1:13,91
All those beautiful colors
ended up on her shirt.


28
0:1:13,91 --> 0:1:17,57
I remember going downstairs, and
the first thing I see is a


29
0:1:17,57 --> 0:1:20,67
chair fly across the hallway.


30
0:1:20,67 --> 0:1:22,48
It was just madness.


31
0:1:22,48 --> 0:1:26,57
People were being thrown, chairs
were being thrown.


32
0:1:26,57 --> 0:1:29,52
There was a kid that was
actually in the corner with


33
0:1:29,52 --> 0:1:32,45
pool balls, throwing
them at people.


34
0:1:32,45 --> 0:1:34,28
And they'd duck, and he's just
throwing them at people.


35
0:1:34,28 --> 0:1:34,98
What the--


36
0:1:34,98 --> 0:1:36,56
A friend of mine, Kathy.


37
0:1:36,56 --> 0:1:39,13
She looks like me without--
minus the beard, I think.


38
0:1:39,13 --> 0:1:41,31
So I don't know, if this
dude mistakes her


39
0:1:41,31 --> 0:1:43,66
for a dude or not.


40
0:1:43,66 --> 0:1:47,24
But all I remember was him
hitting her, and I seen that


41
0:1:47,24 --> 0:1:47,99
from across the room.


42
0:1:47,99 --> 0:1:50,69
I just remember locking
eyes with this dude.


43
0:1:50,69 --> 0:1:54,716
Like, with the power of
Jesus, I cocked back.


44
0:1:54,716 --> 0:1:55,158
Boom!


45
0:1:55,158 --> 0:1:59,76
And tried to knock this dude's
lower jaw off of this face.


46
0:1:59,76 --> 0:2:1,78
There was beer all over the
floor, so when I followed


47
0:2:1,78 --> 0:2:5,8
through, I slipped and
landed on my back.


48
0:2:5,8 --> 0:2:8,0
And I looked to my right.


49
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:11,36
And my right foot had bent up.


50
0:2:11,36 --> 0:2:15,58
Looking down and seeing this
basketball sized chunk of


51
0:2:15,58 --> 0:2:20,59
flesh beating to the same
rate of my heart.


52
0:2:20,59 --> 0:2:23,74
Crazy part is, after the whole
night, we actually had to rush


53
0:2:23,74 --> 0:2:27,26
back and get ready
for this funeral.


54
0:2:27,26 --> 0:2:29,88
So I'm on crutches, trying
to make my way


55
0:2:29,88 --> 0:2:31,13
up to pay my respects.


56
0:2:31,13 --> 0:2:33,95
Now I have this nifty Robocop
leg compartment that I can


57
0:2:33,95 --> 0:2:35,22
keep guns in and shit.


58
0:2:35,22 --> 0:2:36,702
It's kind of awesome.


59
0:2:36,702 --> 0:4:36,702
