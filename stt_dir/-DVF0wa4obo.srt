1
0:0:0,31 --> 0:0:6,89
You know, if we're going to talk about trips
that we've taken, you know, when I was a candidate


2
0:0:6,89 --> 0:0:11,53
for office, first trip I took was to visit
our troops.


3
0:0:11,53 --> 0:0:18,869
And when I went to Israel as a candidate,
I didn't take donors, I didn't attend fundraisers,


4
0:0:18,869 --> 0:0:25,41
I went to Yad Vashem, the — the Holocaust
museum there, to remind myself the — the


5
0:0:25,41 --> 0:0:31,369
nature of evil and why our bond with Israel
will be unbreakable.


6
0:0:31,369 --> 0:0:36,89
And then I went down to the border towns of
Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining


7
0:0:36,89 --> 0:0:43,89
down from Hamas. And I saw families there
who showed me where missiles had come down


8
0:0:43,89 --> 0:0:48,1
near their children's bedrooms, and I was
reminded of — of what that would mean if


9
0:0:48,1 --> 0:0:54,58
those were my kids, which is why, as president,
we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those


10
0:0:54,58 --> 0:0:55,88
missiles.


11
0:0:55,88 --> 0:1:1,81
So that's how I've used my travels when I
travel to Israel and when I travel to the


12
0:1:1,81 --> 0:1:3,27
region.


13
0:1:3,27 --> 0:1:11,549
And the central question at this point is
going to be, who's going to be credible to


14
0:1:11,549 --> 0:1:13,759
all parties involved?


15
0:1:13,759 --> 0:1:17,77
And they can look at my track record — whether
it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing


16
0:1:17,77 --> 0:1:22,53
with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting
democracy, whether it's supporting women's


17
0:1:22,53 --> 0:1:27,2
rights, whether it's supporting religious
minorities — and they can say that the president


18
0:1:27,2 --> 0:1:31,52
of the United States and the United States
of America has stood on the right side of


19
0:1:31,52 --> 0:1:38,53
history. And — and that kind of credibility
is precisely why we've been able to show leadership


20
0:1:38,53 --> 0:3:38,53
on a wide range of issues facing the world
right now.
