Say hello to the new Audi RS7 and its arch-rival,
the BMW M6 Gran Coupe. Both are powered by


2
0:0:15,75 --> 0:0:23,91
turbocharged V8 engines and have over 500bhp
-but do they really justify their nearly £100,000


3
0:0:23,91 --> 0:0:26,14
price tags? Let's find out.


4
0:0:26,14 --> 0:0:33,6
The BMW M6 costs just under £98,000 and features
a 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 with 552bhp and


5
0:0:33,6 --> 0:0:40,16
680Nm of torque. It'll sprint from 0-60 in
just 4.2 seconds before hitting a limited


6
0:0:40,16 --> 0:0:43,16
top speed of 155mph.


7
0:0:43,16 --> 0:0:49,579
The Audi has a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 yet
despite being down on capacity compared to


8
0:0:49,579 --> 0:0:56,82
the BMW it produces the same bhp and has even
more torque with a huge 700Nm. Once again


9
0:0:56,82 --> 0:1:1,59
top speed is limited to 155mph, but it hits
60 in just 3.9 seconds.


10
0:1:1,59 --> 0:1:9,61
Time for a drag race - the Audi's got more
torque and it has four-wheel drive: the conditions


11
0:1:9,61 --> 0:1:14,81
are really wet a greasy so it doesn't play
to the BMW's advantage. But let's see how


12
0:1:14,81 --> 0:1:15,88
we get on.


13
0:1:15,88 --> 0:1:28,38
The Audi's mighty off the line... already
70mph, 80... it's an easy win over the BMW.


14
0:1:28,38 --> 0:1:34,219
So, the Audi won - but straight line pace
is half the story. It's how the cars make


15
0:1:34,219 --> 0:1:37,649
you feel when you drive them that's actually
more important.


16
0:1:37,649 --> 0:1:42,88
What's the RS7 like to drive on a back road?
Well, the first thing is that it's so hard


17
0:1:42,88 --> 0:1:49,889
to use the performance on the road - it's
just warp speed fast so it does feel a little


18
0:1:49,889 --> 0:1:53,989
faster than the M6 but it's so hard to utilise
it on the road.


19
0:1:53,989 --> 0:1:58,9
The one thing the Audi does have is obviously
with quattro all-wheel drive and that clever


20
0:1:58,9 --> 0:2:2,279
sport differential - it doesn't have any of
the traction issues that you get in the M6.


21
0:2:2,279 --> 0:2:6,7
It doesn't work it's stability control as
hard. There's lots of grip but the problem


22
0:2:6,7 --> 0:2:10,88
is it's just a bit inert - there's not a lot
of feel in the steering, a bit of a disconnect


23
0:2:10,88 --> 0:2:16,4
between the steering and you don't get any
sense of the road.


24
0:2:16,4 --> 0:2:21,349
Also, the suspension is a bit odd. The ride
isn't great - in fact it's pretty awful - and


25
0:2:21,349 --> 0:2:26,799
all in all it's not a particularly engaging
car despite its speed and it's not as comfortable


26
0:2:26,799 --> 0:2:37,59
as the BMW. It's quite hard to love this car
despite the fact that the engine is so great.


27
0:2:37,59 --> 0:2:40,409
Overall the Audi, while incredibly capable,
left me feeling a little cold. Hopefully the


28
0:2:40,409 --> 0:2:42,579
BMW will be more fun.


29
0:2:42,579 --> 0:2:47,93
Ok, so how does the BMW compare? Well we know
it lost in the drag race but in reality that's


30
0:2:47,93 --> 0:2:51,89
because of the wet conditions and the fact
it's rear-wheel drive and the Audi got that


31
0:2:51,89 --> 0:2:56,459
4wd traction. In the real world both of these
cars feel stupendously quick.


32
0:2:56,459 --> 0:3:1,599
If anything the BMW engine has a little bit
more character than the Audi engine and there's


33
0:3:1,599 --> 0:3:5,959
certainly more character to the driving experience.
It's not perfect and it troubles the traction


34
0:3:5,959 --> 0:3:10,19
control quite a lot on a wet road and with
it off you've got to have some pretty sharp


35
0:3:10,19 --> 0:3:11,659
reactions to catch the slides.


36
0:3:11,659 --> 0:3:17,849
It's just a bit more lively and you can enjoy
it more, the steering is better - a bit softer


37
0:3:17,849 --> 0:3:22,7
than the Audi but in the comfort modes it
rides better than the Audi too. It's just


38
0:3:22,7 --> 0:3:27,51
a little bit more engaging to drive.


39
0:3:27,51 --> 0:3:29,68
The biggest problem for this car in a way,
though isn't the Audi - it's the M6's sister


40
0:3:29,68 --> 0:3:36,889
car, the M5. This car is substantially more
expensive than the M5 - about £25,000 more


41
0:3:36,889 --> 0:3:43,78
than an M5 - and it doesn't offer a huge amount
more in terms of driving. It's hard to justify


42
0:3:43,78 --> 0:3:44,9
it - but I think it looks great.


43
0:3:44,9 --> 0:3:49,609
So the BMW is the best to drive but it's also
the nicest to sit in, with its stylish interior


44
0:3:49,609 --> 0:3:53,879
and sporty wrap-around cockpit. The Audi's
still feels posh and is loaded with gadgets


45
0:3:53,879 --> 0:3:58,959
but it lacks the BMW's wow factor. With its
hatchback boot the Audi is the more practical


46
0:3:58,959 --> 0:3:59,76
of the pair.


47
0:3:59,76 --> 0:4:7,129
So the Audi is faster and more practical,
but the BMW's better to drive and looks more


48
0:4:7,129 --> 0:4:10,139
exclusive - so which one should you choose?


49
0:4:10,139 --> 0:4:15,599
It might cost a lot more money than the BMW
M5 but we'd go for the M6 Gran Coupe - it


50
0:4:15,599 --> 0:6:15,599
looks great, sounds fantastic and most importantly
it's more fun to drive than the Audi RS7.
