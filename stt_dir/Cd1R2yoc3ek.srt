1
0:1:48,584 --> 0:1:54,542
- Ladies and gentlemen...


2
0:1:54,542 --> 0:1:59,167
When the Russian actress
and dancer Natalya Dolzhenko


3
0:1:59,167 --> 0:2:2,84
made Salome in 1908,


4
0:2:2,84 --> 0:2:6,125
she wore a necklace
made of magnificent pearls


5
0:2:6,125 --> 0:2:11,709
given to her by the czar.


6
0:2:11,709 --> 0:2:14,959
Last week,
at an auction in Paris,


7
0:2:14,959 --> 0:2:22,84
I paid 300,000 francs
for that same pearl necklace.


8
0:2:22,84 --> 0:2:41,792
My wife is going to show it
to you now.


9
0:2:41,792 --> 0:2:45,625
- Ladies and gentlemen,
dear friends,


10
0:2:45,625 --> 0:2:50,292
our new play premieres here
at your beautiful theater


11
0:2:50,292 --> 0:2:54,84
next week, prior to
a six-month tour of America.


12
0:2:54,84 --> 0:2:57,459
- Yes, Margaret is taking
the leading part,


13
0:2:57,459 --> 0:3:0,709
and she will be wearing
the czar's pearls


14
0:3:0,709 --> 0:3:3,25
at each and every performance.


15
0:3:3,25 --> 0:3:7,209
- Mr. Opalsen,
don't the pearls get stolen


16
0:3:7,209 --> 0:3:10,459
in the course of the play?


17
0:3:10,459 --> 0:3:12,167
- Yes, they do.


18
0:3:12,167 --> 0:3:13,792
But that's in the play.


19
0:3:13,792 --> 0:3:18,667
They will be under guard
24 hours a day.


20
0:3:18,667 --> 0:3:30,5
I think I can promise you
that they're not going anywhere.


21
0:3:30,5 --> 0:3:31,625
- Ah.
Ah.


22
0:3:31,625 --> 0:3:34,84
- And again, please.


23
0:3:34,84 --> 0:3:37,667
- Ah.


24
0:3:37,667 --> 0:3:41,0
- Thank you.


25
0:3:41,0 --> 0:3:43,792
- Well, Doctor?
Tell me.


26
0:3:43,792 --> 0:3:46,25
What is your diagnosis?


27
0:3:46,25 --> 0:3:49,292
- Well, essentially...
- Yes?


28
0:3:49,292 --> 0:3:51,42
- You're run down.


29
0:3:51,42 --> 0:3:54,542
Even those famous gray cells
of yours


30
0:3:54,542 --> 0:3:57,42
need an occasional rest.


31
0:3:57,42 --> 0:3:59,542
- It is true, Mr. Poirot.


32
0:3:59,542 --> 0:4:2,75
You've been taking on
much too much recently.


33
0:4:2,75 --> 0:4:4,75
- Two weeks' complete rest.


34
0:4:4,75 --> 0:4:7,75
That's the answer.


35
0:4:7,75 --> 0:4:18,709
If I were you, I'd think
of getting out of London.


36
0:4:18,709 --> 0:4:20,42
- This hotel, Hastings,


37
0:4:20,42 --> 0:4:22,209
it has, I hope,
the full central heating.


38
0:4:22,209 --> 0:4:24,834
- Well, Miss Lemon said
it had all the comforts.


39
0:4:24,834 --> 0:4:27,959
Now, where's a cab?


40
0:4:27,959 --> 0:4:30,542
Well, I must say,
it's good to be out of London.


41
0:4:30,542 --> 0:4:33,709
Less traffic, for a start.


42
0:4:33,709 --> 0:4:36,84
- Less taxis also,
it would appear.


43
0:4:36,84 --> 0:4:37,209
- Yes.


44
0:4:37,209 --> 0:4:39,584
- I know you.


45
0:4:39,584 --> 0:4:40,667
- It is possible, yes.


46
0:4:40,667 --> 0:4:42,375
- Your face been in the paper.


47
0:4:42,375 --> 0:4:44,625
- Yes, that is true,
on many occasions.


48
0:4:44,625 --> 0:4:52,75
- You're Lucky Len,
and I claim my ten guineas.


49
0:4:52,75 --> 0:4:54,542
I've got my paper,
I said the right words,


50
0:4:54,542 --> 0:4:55,625
so where's my money?


51
0:4:55,625 --> 0:4:56,792
- Please.
Do you mind?


52
0:4:56,792 --> 0:4:58,834
Grand Metropolitan Hotel,
driver.


53
0:4:58,834 --> 0:5:4,875
- Right-o, guv.


54
0:5:4,875 --> 0:5:7,167
- It's a sort of game, Poirot.


55
0:5:7,167 --> 0:5:8,834
The newspaper prints
a photograph


56
0:5:8,834 --> 0:5:10,167
of this character Lucky Len,


57
0:5:10,167 --> 0:5:16,5
and whoever finds him
gets ten guineas.


58
0:5:16,5 --> 0:5:18,417
- This holiday, Hastings.


59
0:5:18,417 --> 0:5:29,5
Already, I begin to have
the second thoughts.


60
0:5:29,5 --> 0:5:31,292
- Your key, Mr. Worthing.


61
0:5:31,292 --> 0:5:32,75
- Room 113?


62
0:5:32,75 --> 0:5:34,167
- Yes, sir.


63
0:5:34,167 --> 0:5:37,42
It's as you requested:
on the first floor.


64
0:5:37,42 --> 0:5:46,875
- Good.
Thank you.


65
0:5:46,875 --> 0:5:59,875
- I'll have your bags
sent up, sir.


66
0:5:59,875 --> 0:6:1,417
- It is most curious, that,
Hastings.


67
0:6:1,417 --> 0:6:3,542
Did you not remark?
- What's what?


68
0:6:3,542 --> 0:6:5,459
- The gentleman that just
booked in ahead of us.


69
0:6:5,459 --> 0:6:8,75
- Honestly, Poirot,
you are incorrigible.


70
0:6:8,75 --> 0:6:10,209
- Mr. Poirot, isn't it?


71
0:6:10,209 --> 0:6:11,709
- Yes?


72
0:6:11,709 --> 0:6:13,875
- What a great privilege
to have you here


73
0:6:13,875 --> 0:6:15,334
at the Grand Metropolitan.


74
0:6:15,334 --> 0:6:16,459
- Thank you.


75
0:6:16,459 --> 0:6:17,542
- Boy?


76
0:6:17,542 --> 0:6:19,917
- You got a nice sea view here.


77
0:6:19,917 --> 0:6:22,584
Bathroom through there.


78
0:6:22,584 --> 0:6:27,167
Two bedrooms.


79
0:6:27,167 --> 0:6:28,25
You going to the race?


80
0:6:28,25 --> 0:6:29,417
- Oh, we might.


81
0:6:29,417 --> 0:6:30,792
- I think not.


82
0:6:30,792 --> 0:6:34,125
- Laughing Boy in the 4:00,
that's my tip.


83
0:6:34,125 --> 0:6:36,125
How about the theater?


84
0:6:36,125 --> 0:6:38,167
There's a new show
opening this week.


85
0:6:38,167 --> 0:6:39,542
I can get you tickets.


86
0:6:39,542 --> 0:6:41,292
- Hastings?


87
0:6:41,292 --> 0:6:43,5
- Well, I reckon
you'd enjoy it, sir,


88
0:6:43,5 --> 0:6:45,959
you being a detective and that.


89
0:6:45,959 --> 0:6:48,417
They got a necklace
worth a bundle onstage.


90
0:6:48,417 --> 0:6:49,875
- Yes, I read about that.


91
0:6:49,875 --> 0:6:53,42
- Mr. Opalsen, the producer,
he's staying here too,


92
0:6:53,42 --> 0:6:54,625
him and his wife.


93
0:6:54,625 --> 0:6:59,625
Oh, thank you, sir.


94
0:6:59,625 --> 0:7:3,792
- Un moment, s'il vous plait.


95
0:7:3,792 --> 0:7:5,75
This Monsieur Opalsen,


96
0:7:5,75 --> 0:7:7,667
would you happen to know
which is his room?


97
0:7:7,667 --> 0:7:8,959
- Poirot.


98
0:7:8,959 --> 0:7:10,667
- Yes, of course I do, sir.


99
0:7:10,667 --> 0:7:13,42
The Imperial Suite, number 114.


100
0:7:13,42 --> 0:7:15,334
Just here, sir.


101
0:7:15,334 --> 0:7:24,0
- Merci.


102
0:7:24,0 --> 0:7:27,292
- Ah, here we are,
Laughing Boy in the 4:00.


103
0:7:27,292 --> 0:7:28,375
Seven to one.


104
0:7:28,375 --> 0:7:32,75
Perhaps I will have a try.


105
0:7:32,75 --> 0:7:34,84
- Mr. Poirot--


106
0:7:34,84 --> 0:7:36,42
- I hope you'll forgive me,
Mr. Poirot,


107
0:7:36,42 --> 0:7:37,875
but when I heard
that the famous detective


108
0:7:37,875 --> 0:7:40,0
was staying at the hotel,
I just had to meet him.


109
0:7:40,0 --> 0:7:41,959
- Mr. Poirot,
this is Mr. Opalsen,


110
0:7:41,959 --> 0:7:43,292
the producer.


111
0:7:43,292 --> 0:7:45,25
- Ah, yes, of course.


112
0:7:45,25 --> 0:7:47,0
Monsieur Opalsen.


113
0:7:47,0 --> 0:7:49,0
My associate, Captain Hastings,
and myself


114
0:7:49,0 --> 0:7:51,0
have already heard much
about your production.


115
0:7:51,0 --> 0:7:52,709
Will you join us?


116
0:7:52,709 --> 0:7:53,792
- Thank you.


117
0:7:53,792 --> 0:7:57,75
Yes, Pearls Before Swine.


118
0:7:57,75 --> 0:7:59,625
It opens tonight.


119
0:7:59,625 --> 0:8:2,209
I'd be honored
if you'd come as my guests.


120
0:8:2,209 --> 0:8:4,417
And to the party afterwards?


121
0:8:4,417 --> 0:8:8,292
- Oh, that's jolly decent
of you.


122
0:8:8,292 --> 0:8:9,917
- And it is tonight, I think,


123
0:8:9,917 --> 0:8:12,667
that your famous necklace
makes also its debut.


124
0:8:12,667 --> 0:8:15,417
- Yes, the maid's just taking it
to the theater now.


125
0:8:15,417 --> 0:8:23,25
Celestine, show Mr. Poirot
the pearls.


126
0:8:23,25 --> 0:8:24,959
Well, get them out of the box.


127
0:8:24,959 --> 0:8:26,42
- I can't, sir.


128
0:8:26,42 --> 0:8:28,25
I don't have the key.


129
0:8:28,25 --> 0:8:31,25
- Why not, damn it?
Where'd you put it?


130
0:8:31,25 --> 0:8:33,834
- Mr. Opalsen keeps it, sir.


131
0:8:33,834 --> 0:8:34,875
She insists.


132
0:8:34,875 --> 0:8:38,709
- Ugh.
Security.


133
0:8:38,709 --> 0:8:40,709
- You carry the necklace
on your own?


134
0:8:40,709 --> 0:8:42,417
- No, sir.


135
0:8:42,417 --> 0:8:45,25
- No, Saunders, my driver,
always goes with her.


136
0:8:45,25 --> 0:8:47,42
As a matter of fact, he's late.


137
0:8:47,42 --> 0:8:51,334
- Then perhaps you will permit
Captain Hastings and myself


138
0:8:51,334 --> 0:8:52,625
to accompany la mademoiselle.


139
0:8:52,625 --> 0:8:54,125
- Well, that's very kind.


140
0:8:54,125 --> 0:8:55,292
- Not at all.


141
0:8:55,292 --> 0:8:56,959
It is our pleasure,
is it not, Hastings?


142
0:8:56,959 --> 0:9:2,5
- Oh, rather.


143
0:9:2,5 --> 0:9:3,917
- Margaret?


144
0:9:3,917 --> 0:9:5,292
Now, listen, dear.


145
0:9:5,292 --> 0:9:8,292
You'll never guess
who I've just met.


146
0:9:8,292 --> 0:9:9,417
Yup.


147
0:9:9,417 --> 0:9:12,5
It's Poirot, Hercule Poirot.


148
0:9:12,5 --> 0:9:14,542
He's on his way over now.


149
0:9:14,542 --> 0:9:15,667
I know.


150
0:9:15,667 --> 0:9:16,875
That's right.


151
0:9:16,875 --> 0:9:24,417
We're going to have to do
something.


152
0:9:24,417 --> 0:9:26,917
- Mademoiselle,
your name of Celestine,


153
0:9:26,917 --> 0:9:28,584
it is French, n'est-ce pas?


154
0:9:28,584 --> 0:9:30,334
- My mother was French, sir,


155
0:9:30,334 --> 0:9:32,542
but I've always lived here.


156
0:9:32,542 --> 0:9:35,5
I was hoping to be
in the theater myself one day.


157
0:9:35,5 --> 0:9:36,667
- Ah.


158
0:9:36,667 --> 0:9:38,667
And you have been working
with Monsieur Opalsen


159
0:9:38,667 --> 0:9:39,834
for how long?


160
0:9:39,834 --> 0:9:41,834
- About two years.


161
0:9:41,834 --> 0:9:43,542
He's not normally so edgy, sir.


162
0:9:43,542 --> 0:9:45,334
It's just
when there's a first night.


163
0:9:45,334 --> 0:9:47,542
- Have you seen
Pearls Before Swine?


164
0:9:47,542 --> 0:9:51,0
- Only in rehearsal,
but it's beautifully written.


165
0:9:51,0 --> 0:9:53,459
I'm sure Mr. Opalsen has nothing
to worry--


166
0:9:53,459 --> 0:9:56,42
- Stop!


167
0:9:56,42 --> 0:9:58,25
Stop.


168
0:9:58,25 --> 0:10:1,125
You are Lucky Len
of the Daily Echo,


169
0:10:1,125 --> 0:10:3,459
and I claim my ten guineas.


170
0:10:3,459 --> 0:10:5,0
- No, madame, I am not Len.


171
0:10:5,0 --> 0:10:7,167
And, therefore, for you,
I am not lucky.


172
0:10:7,167 --> 0:10:20,334
Excuse me.


173
0:10:20,334 --> 0:10:21,959
- Here we are.


174
0:10:21,959 --> 0:10:25,834
We can go in the back way.


175
0:10:25,834 --> 0:10:28,375
- All right, where is it?


176
0:10:28,375 --> 0:10:29,584
- Let me go!


177
0:10:29,584 --> 0:10:30,917
- The money.


178
0:10:30,917 --> 0:10:32,709
- Look, you'll have it.


179
0:10:32,709 --> 0:10:33,75
- When?


180
0:10:33,75 --> 0:10:34,792
- Tomorrow.


181
0:10:34,792 --> 0:10:35,959
- You said that yesterday.


182
0:10:35,959 --> 0:10:39,209
- No!


183
0:10:39,209 --> 0:10:40,375
- Tomorrow.


184
0:10:40,375 --> 0:10:41,5
- I promise you.


185
0:10:41,5 --> 0:10:42,959
- Andrew!


186
0:10:42,959 --> 0:10:45,875
- Tomorrow, then, or else.


187
0:10:45,875 --> 0:10:50,584
- Give me the bag, mademoiselle.


188
0:10:50,584 --> 0:10:52,334
- Are you all right?


189
0:10:52,334 --> 0:10:54,625
- Fine.


190
0:10:54,625 --> 0:10:57,875
They haven't hurt me.


191
0:10:57,875 --> 0:11:0,0
My God, you're Hercule Poirot,
aren't you?


192
0:11:0,0 --> 0:11:1,542
- Oui.


193
0:11:1,542 --> 0:11:4,375
It would appear that you are
in need of assistance, monsieur.


194
0:11:4,375 --> 0:11:5,917
- Me?


195
0:11:5,917 --> 0:11:8,167
No, no, those are just


196
0:11:8,167 --> 0:11:12,0
what you might call
business associates.


197
0:11:12,0 --> 0:11:13,917
It's nothing I can't handle.


198
0:11:13,917 --> 0:11:15,5
- This is Andrew Hall,


199
0:11:15,5 --> 0:11:17,167
the writer
I was telling you about.


200
0:11:17,167 --> 0:11:19,42
- Ah, Monsieur Hall.


201
0:11:19,42 --> 0:11:21,25
- So it's your play.


202
0:11:21,25 --> 0:11:24,0
- It's Ed Opalsen's play.


203
0:11:24,0 --> 0:11:25,625
He bought it, cut it,
rewrote it,


204
0:11:25,625 --> 0:11:27,459
and left me with about 2% of it.


205
0:11:27,459 --> 0:11:29,709
Hence my current difficulties.


206
0:11:29,709 --> 0:11:32,209
- Are you sure you're all right?


207
0:11:32,209 --> 0:11:33,5
- Yes.


208
0:11:33,5 --> 0:11:34,959
- I have to go in.


209
0:11:34,959 --> 0:11:36,0
- I'll come with you.


210
0:11:36,0 --> 0:11:38,417
- Thank you, Mr. Poirot.


211
0:11:38,417 --> 0:11:49,5
- Mademoiselle.


212
0:11:49,5 --> 0:11:51,334
You know, Hastings,


213
0:11:51,334 --> 0:11:54,125
I begin, I think,
to look forward to this play.


214
0:11:54,125 --> 0:11:56,42
- Glad to hear it.


215
0:11:56,42 --> 0:12:0,292
- Thank you.


216
0:12:0,292 --> 0:12:2,0
- I'll go.


217
0:12:2,0 --> 0:12:7,0
- Thank you, Hastings.


218
0:12:7,0 --> 0:12:8,375
- Ah.


219
0:12:8,375 --> 0:12:9,459
- Mr. Poirot?


220
0:12:9,459 --> 0:12:11,42
- I am Poirot.


221
0:12:11,42 --> 0:12:13,125
- Ah.


222
0:12:13,125 --> 0:12:15,84
My name is Saunders, sir.


223
0:12:15,84 --> 0:12:17,375
Mr. Opalsen's chauffeur.


224
0:12:17,375 --> 0:12:18,875
- Yes?


225
0:12:18,875 --> 0:12:21,625
- Mr. Opalsen has sent me
to take you to the theater, sir,


226
0:12:21,625 --> 0:12:23,125
with his compliments.


227
0:12:23,125 --> 0:12:29,25
- Thank you.


228
0:12:29,25 --> 0:12:30,959
- Here he comes.


229
0:12:30,959 --> 0:12:32,75
Mr. Poirot?
- Mr. Poirot.


230
0:12:32,75 --> 0:12:34,709
Have you been challenged
to solve the play, sir?


231
0:12:34,709 --> 0:12:36,292
- This I do not believe.
Hastings!


232
0:12:36,292 --> 0:12:39,125
- Mr. Poirot, how many acts
do you think it will take?


233
0:12:39,125 --> 0:12:40,542
- Excuse me!


234
0:12:40,542 --> 0:12:42,84
It is an outrage, Hastings,


235
0:12:42,84 --> 0:12:44,417
to use Hercule Poirot
for the publicity of this play.


236
0:12:44,417 --> 0:12:45,5
- Absolutely.


237
0:12:45,5 --> 0:12:48,625
It's beginning.


238
0:12:48,625 --> 0:12:51,459
- Inspector Drake should be here
pretty soon.


239
0:12:51,459 --> 0:12:55,125
- Oh, is Inspector Drake
really coming here?


240
0:12:55,125 --> 0:12:57,834
I've read so much about him
in the newspapers.


241
0:12:57,834 --> 0:13:0,25
- Oh, yes, Inspector Drake and I
have worked together


242
0:13:0,25 --> 0:13:2,167
quite a lot recently.


243
0:13:2,167 --> 0:13:3,917
- Good luck, my dear.


244
0:13:3,917 --> 0:13:6,417
- And you're a mere
local sergeant.


245
0:13:6,417 --> 0:13:8,959
Oh, here's Inspector Drake
coming now.


246
0:13:8,959 --> 0:13:10,959
Shh!
Good evening, sir.


247
0:13:10,959 --> 0:13:12,75
My lady will be here presently.


248
0:13:12,75 --> 0:13:14,584
- Good.
I must speak to her at once.


249
0:13:14,584 --> 0:13:18,167
- My dear inspector.


250
0:13:18,167 --> 0:13:20,167
- Forgive me, Lady Jane,


251
0:13:20,167 --> 0:13:23,542
but I don't think
you should be wearing that.


252
0:13:23,542 --> 0:13:26,834
- The necklace?
Whyever not?


253
0:13:26,834 --> 0:13:31,375
- Because the Phantom has sworn
to have it,


254
0:13:31,375 --> 0:13:38,625
and the Phantom
has never once failed.


255
0:13:38,625 --> 0:13:39,917
- I think it's about time


256
0:13:39,917 --> 0:13:42,459
we made an appearance
at the party.


257
0:13:42,459 --> 0:13:44,792
Well, you're not going to wear
the pearls?


258
0:13:44,792 --> 0:13:47,625
- I'm tired of being upstaged
by them.


259
0:13:47,625 --> 0:13:48,959
Celestine.


260
0:13:48,959 --> 0:13:50,542
- Yes, Mrs. Opalsen.


261
0:13:50,542 --> 0:13:53,84
- Is it safe
just leaving them there?


262
0:13:53,84 --> 0:13:55,875
- Of course.
Celestine won't leave the room.


263
0:13:55,875 --> 0:13:59,334
- More champagne?
- No, thank you.


264
0:13:59,334 --> 0:14:1,209
- I don't see why
you don't wear the pearls.


265
0:14:1,209 --> 0:14:2,584
It's good publicity.


266
0:14:2,584 --> 0:14:4,584
- That's all
you ever think about.


267
0:14:4,584 --> 0:14:6,792
Now, you heard what I said,
didn't you, Celestine?


268
0:14:6,792 --> 0:14:8,84
- Yes, mum.


269
0:14:8,84 --> 0:14:10,375
- I'll have your supper sent up
to you.


270
0:14:10,375 --> 0:14:22,125
There.


271
0:14:22,125 --> 0:14:23,417
- Come on, then.


272
0:14:23,417 --> 0:14:37,875
Time to play host and hostess.


273
0:14:37,875 --> 0:14:44,209
- Thank you.


274
0:14:44,209 --> 0:14:46,834
- I hope you enjoy
the party, sir.


275
0:14:46,834 --> 0:14:47,959
- Thank you.


276
0:14:47,959 --> 0:14:49,875
Oh, pardon.
You will forgive me?


277
0:14:49,875 --> 0:14:51,542
- Oh.


278
0:14:51,542 --> 0:14:53,0
Thank you very much, sir.


279
0:14:53,0 --> 0:14:57,375
- Not at all.


280
0:14:57,375 --> 0:14:59,292
- I'll be waiting
for you here, sir.


281
0:14:59,292 --> 0:15:6,125
- Thank you.


282
0:15:6,125 --> 0:15:7,375
- Who is it?


283
0:15:7,375 --> 0:15:9,625
- Maid, mum.
Got your supper for you.


284
0:15:9,625 --> 0:15:13,167
- One moment.


285
0:15:13,167 --> 0:15:14,334
That's very kind of you.


286
0:15:14,334 --> 0:15:15,625
- All part of the service.


287
0:15:15,625 --> 0:15:17,0
Do you want me to carry it in?


288
0:15:17,0 --> 0:15:21,209
- Yes, put it over there.


289
0:15:21,209 --> 0:15:22,75
- All on your own, are you?


290
0:15:22,75 --> 0:15:23,959
- Yes.


291
0:15:23,959 --> 0:15:25,167
- That's a shame.


292
0:15:25,167 --> 0:15:27,292
All the rest of them
at the party.


293
0:15:27,292 --> 0:15:28,625
Tell you what.


294
0:15:28,625 --> 0:15:33,209
I'll sit with you, if you like.


295
0:15:33,209 --> 0:15:35,84
- Thank you.


296
0:15:35,84 --> 0:15:37,584
My name's Grace,
Grace Wilson.


297
0:15:37,584 --> 0:15:40,167
So how do you like
the Grand Metropolitan?


298
0:15:40,167 --> 0:15:42,834
- Let us say it was an evening
I shall not easily forget.


299
0:15:42,834 --> 0:15:44,5
- Ah, Mr. Poirot.


300
0:15:44,5 --> 0:15:45,542
- Excuse me.


301
0:15:45,542 --> 0:15:47,125
- I'm delighted
you could make it.


302
0:15:47,125 --> 0:15:49,584
- Monsieur.
Madame.


303
0:15:49,584 --> 0:15:52,334
Monsieur Opalsen,
at the theater this evening,


304
0:15:52,334 --> 0:15:54,167
there were some journalists
awaiting me.


305
0:15:54,167 --> 0:15:56,459
This was not, I think,
a coincidence.


306
0:15:56,459 --> 0:15:58,42
- Uh, no.


307
0:15:58,42 --> 0:16:1,75
But a man in my position needs
all the publicity he can get.


308
0:16:1,75 --> 0:16:4,125
- I bet you'd guessed
who'd stolen the pearls


309
0:16:4,125 --> 0:16:6,84
by the second interval,
Monsieur Poirot.


310
0:16:6,84 --> 0:16:7,417
- Not at all, madame.


311
0:16:7,417 --> 0:16:10,84
It was a question
that ceased to occupy my mind


312
0:16:10,84 --> 0:16:12,417
long before the first.


313
0:16:12,417 --> 0:16:16,625
Excuse me.


314
0:16:16,625 --> 0:16:18,42
- They're not really that bad.


315
0:16:18,42 --> 0:16:19,5
- Oh, you should try this job.


316
0:16:19,5 --> 0:16:21,209
I could tell you a thing or two.


317
0:16:21,209 --> 0:16:23,209
- Have you worked here long?


318
0:16:23,209 --> 0:16:46,959
- Not here, no...


319
0:16:46,959 --> 0:16:48,917
- Mr. Poirot.


320
0:16:48,917 --> 0:16:50,834
Hubert Devine.


321
0:16:50,834 --> 0:16:53,84
I played the detective, Drake.


322
0:16:53,84 --> 0:16:54,875
- Ah, yes, of course.


323
0:16:54,875 --> 0:16:58,167
I found your performance
most engaging.


324
0:16:58,167 --> 0:16:59,75
- It's a jolly good play.


325
0:16:59,75 --> 0:17:2,292
- Yes, I think it's going to be
a success.


326
0:17:2,292 --> 0:17:4,875
And just as well.


327
0:17:4,875 --> 0:17:7,667
Dear Ed needs a winner.


328
0:17:7,667 --> 0:17:10,667
Well, three disasters
last season.


329
0:17:10,667 --> 0:17:13,709
He only had one success,
and that was a revival.


330
0:17:13,709 --> 0:17:17,792
Oh, yes.


331
0:17:17,792 --> 0:17:20,84
If Pearls doesn't run,


332
0:17:20,84 --> 0:17:27,5
I'd say he was finished.


333
0:17:27,5 --> 0:17:30,5
- I do like these telegrams.


334
0:17:30,5 --> 0:17:32,167
They're really nice.


335
0:17:32,167 --> 0:17:33,834
They always send them?
- Mm.


336
0:17:33,834 --> 0:17:36,542
Oh, I need some scissors.


337
0:17:36,542 --> 0:17:39,292
- I can get you some,
if you like.


338
0:17:39,292 --> 0:17:41,584
- No, it's all right;
I've got some somewhere.


339
0:17:41,584 --> 0:17:46,5
Oh, I hate sewing.


340
0:17:46,5 --> 0:17:47,792
- Good night.
Thank you.


341
0:17:47,792 --> 0:17:49,334
- Did you enjoy yourself, sir?


342
0:17:49,334 --> 0:17:51,167
- Yes, thank you, Saunders.


343
0:17:51,167 --> 0:17:52,542
But now, you know, the fatigue.


344
0:17:52,542 --> 0:17:54,42
- Well, it is after midnight.


345
0:17:54,42 --> 0:17:55,75
- Yes, indeed, Hastings.


346
0:17:55,75 --> 0:18:1,875
Thank you.


347
0:18:1,875 --> 0:18:3,417
- We're back, Celestine.


348
0:18:3,417 --> 0:18:4,625
Everything all right?


349
0:18:4,625 --> 0:18:6,625
- Yes, mum.
Everything's fine.


350
0:18:6,625 --> 0:18:8,917
- What a dreary party.


351
0:18:8,917 --> 0:18:12,167
- Well, you weren't exactly
glittering yourself, my dear.


352
0:18:12,167 --> 0:18:14,667
- And you drank too much.


353
0:18:14,667 --> 0:18:16,542
- Why not?
I paid for it.


354
0:18:16,542 --> 0:18:19,125
- Celestine, my jewelry box.


355
0:18:19,125 --> 0:18:23,375
- Yes, mum.


356
0:18:23,375 --> 0:18:26,792
- That damn writer Andrew Hall
didn't even bother to show up.


357
0:18:26,792 --> 0:18:29,42
- I saw him leave the theater.


358
0:18:29,42 --> 0:18:30,125
He was avoiding you.


359
0:18:30,125 --> 0:18:31,5
- Are you inferring something?


360
0:18:31,5 --> 0:18:33,42
- No.


361
0:18:33,42 --> 0:18:35,542
Here's the key.


362
0:18:35,542 --> 0:18:37,667
Are you still drinking?


363
0:18:37,667 --> 0:18:43,125
- Yes.
Do you want one?


364
0:18:43,125 --> 0:18:46,209
- Sir?


365
0:18:46,209 --> 0:18:47,834
Mrs. Opalsen.


366
0:18:47,834 --> 0:18:50,42
- What is it?


367
0:18:50,42 --> 0:18:53,375
- The necklace.


368
0:18:53,375 --> 0:18:56,0
I don't understand it.
It's not here.


369
0:18:56,0 --> 0:18:57,5
- What do you mean,
it's not there?


370
0:18:57,5 --> 0:18:58,625
It's got to be.


371
0:18:58,625 --> 0:19:3,542
- Out of the way.
Let me look.


372
0:19:3,542 --> 0:19:5,42
For heaven's sake.


373
0:19:5,42 --> 0:19:7,625
Call the police.


374
0:19:7,625 --> 0:19:16,917
Someone has stolen my pearls!


375
0:19:16,917 --> 0:19:19,542
- I take it, Monsieur Opalsen,


376
0:19:19,542 --> 0:19:25,42
that you have summoned
the police?


377
0:19:25,42 --> 0:19:27,334
- Yes, of course.


378
0:19:27,334 --> 0:19:29,84
They're sending someone down
from London.


379
0:19:29,84 --> 0:19:30,917
But that's not good enough.


380
0:19:30,917 --> 0:19:33,0
I want you, Mr. Poirot.


381
0:19:33,0 --> 0:19:34,209
- Ah.


382
0:19:34,209 --> 0:19:41,292
- I beg of you.
I've got to get them back.


383
0:19:41,292 --> 0:19:46,375
- And these pearls,
they were, without doubt,


384
0:19:46,375 --> 0:19:47,792
insured?


385
0:19:47,792 --> 0:19:52,0
- Well, yes, but--
but that's not the point.


386
0:19:52,0 --> 0:19:54,209
The play, Mr. Poirot,


387
0:19:54,209 --> 0:19:57,167
all the publicity
about the pearls.


388
0:19:57,167 --> 0:19:59,292
If they aren't returned,
I'll be a laughingstock.


389
0:19:59,292 --> 0:20:0,917
We have an American tour.


390
0:20:0,917 --> 0:20:4,0
How can we do Pearls
Before Swine with no pearls?


391
0:20:4,0 --> 0:20:5,75
- Poirot?


392
0:20:5,75 --> 0:20:6,834
- Excuse me.


393
0:20:6,834 --> 0:20:8,375
Mon cher Hastings?


394
0:20:8,375 --> 0:20:9,834
- The doctor.
- Comment?


395
0:20:9,834 --> 0:20:13,709
- I just think you ought
to remember why you're here.


396
0:20:13,709 --> 0:20:15,5
- Yes, that is true.


397
0:20:15,5 --> 0:20:24,375
But, Hastings--


398
0:20:24,375 --> 0:20:27,5
Monsieur Opalsen,


399
0:20:27,5 --> 0:20:32,0
I regret that Poirot
cannot help you in this matter.


400
0:20:32,0 --> 0:20:34,84
- What?


401
0:20:34,84 --> 0:20:37,209
- I am here


402
0:20:37,209 --> 0:20:45,875
en vacances.


403
0:20:45,875 --> 0:20:47,417
- Ah, morning, Poirot.


404
0:20:47,417 --> 0:20:56,292
- Bonjour, Chief Inspector Japp.


405
0:20:56,292 --> 0:21:3,167
- Imperial Suite, please.


406
0:21:3,167 --> 0:21:6,334
- I took the necklace off
before the party


407
0:21:6,334 --> 0:21:8,625
and put it in my jewelry box.


408
0:21:8,625 --> 0:21:11,917
And then I put the box
in the drawer.


409
0:21:11,917 --> 0:21:14,334
- Was the drawer locked?


410
0:21:14,334 --> 0:21:15,667
- No, it wasn't.


411
0:21:15,667 --> 0:21:20,834
Celestine was here,
so I felt there was no need.


412
0:21:20,834 --> 0:21:23,625
- How many keys are there
to this box, Mrs. Opalsen?


413
0:21:23,625 --> 0:21:27,334
- Only one, and I keep it
with me all the time.


414
0:21:27,334 --> 0:21:28,584
- You're sure of that?


415
0:21:28,584 --> 0:21:30,959
It doesn't seem
to have been forced.


416
0:21:30,959 --> 0:21:33,459
- Of course I'm sure.


417
0:21:33,459 --> 0:21:42,875
There's only ever been one key.


418
0:21:42,875 --> 0:21:46,375
- I'm going to offer a reward,
Chief Inspector, a big one.


419
0:21:46,375 --> 0:21:47,709
You think that'll help?


420
0:21:47,709 --> 0:21:52,917
- It may, sir.


421
0:21:52,917 --> 0:21:56,292
So what were you doing
when all this was going on?


422
0:21:56,292 --> 0:21:59,0
- I was doing the sewing, sir.


423
0:21:59,0 --> 0:22:3,375
I only went
into the side room...


424
0:22:3,375 --> 0:22:9,459
The first time for scissors
and later for thread.


425
0:22:9,459 --> 0:22:19,459
- Look at the little boats
over there.


426
0:22:19,459 --> 0:22:21,5
- Oh, cheer up, Poirot.


427
0:22:21,5 --> 0:22:23,542
It is for the best.


428
0:22:23,542 --> 0:22:25,75
- I have no doubt, Hastings.


429
0:22:25,75 --> 0:22:27,834
- Well, you're here for a rest.


430
0:22:27,834 --> 0:22:29,834
If you're going to get involved
in another case,


431
0:22:29,834 --> 0:22:31,792
you might just as well
have stayed in London.


432
0:22:31,792 --> 0:22:33,584
- It is true.


433
0:22:33,584 --> 0:22:35,5
- I don't know why
you can't just sit back


434
0:22:35,5 --> 0:22:41,125
and enjoy the sea air.


435
0:22:41,125 --> 0:22:42,875
- I know you.


436
0:22:42,875 --> 0:22:44,0
- No, no, no, Hastings.


437
0:22:44,0 --> 0:22:45,375
It is no use.


438
0:22:45,375 --> 0:22:46,917
Not to take this case is,
for Poirot,


439
0:22:46,917 --> 0:22:55,209
more hard work
than to take it.


440
0:22:55,209 --> 0:22:57,5
- Saunders, get the car started.


441
0:22:57,5 --> 0:22:58,75
I'm in a hurry.


442
0:22:58,75 --> 0:23:0,459
- Monsieur Hall.
- What?


443
0:23:0,459 --> 0:23:2,25
Oh, um, Mr. Poirot.


444
0:23:2,25 --> 0:23:3,542
I'm afraid I can't stop.


445
0:23:3,542 --> 0:23:5,209
- You've heard, then,
about the pearls?


446
0:23:5,209 --> 0:23:6,417
- Yes.


447
0:23:6,417 --> 0:23:8,25
What was it
about life imitating art?


448
0:23:8,25 --> 0:23:9,417
Serves Ed right.


449
0:23:9,417 --> 0:23:12,334
Anyway, it's not my problem.


450
0:23:12,334 --> 0:23:13,709
- Monsieur Hall?


451
0:23:13,709 --> 0:23:15,834
I noticed that you were not
at the party last night.


452
0:23:15,834 --> 0:23:17,959
- Well, I wasn't
in a party mood.


453
0:23:17,959 --> 0:23:19,25
- May I ask where you were?


454
0:23:19,25 --> 0:23:20,709
- I went for a walk.


455
0:23:20,709 --> 0:23:23,625
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really will be late.


456
0:23:23,625 --> 0:23:33,875
Thank you, Saunders.


457
0:23:33,875 --> 0:23:36,667
- I only stayed with her
'cause I felt sorry for her.


458
0:23:36,667 --> 0:23:38,834
- So you were alone in the room
with the necklace.


459
0:23:38,834 --> 0:23:41,0
- Yeah, for about two seconds.


460
0:23:41,0 --> 0:23:42,5
Didn't even know it was there.


461
0:23:42,5 --> 0:23:44,667
Blooming cheek.


462
0:23:44,667 --> 0:23:46,209
- Chief Inspector?


463
0:23:46,209 --> 0:23:48,584
- Ah, hello, Poirot.


464
0:23:48,584 --> 0:23:49,875
- Excuse us, mademoiselle.


465
0:23:49,875 --> 0:23:51,625
- Thought you were
sitting this one out.


466
0:23:51,625 --> 0:23:54,42
- Well--
- No, no, no, no, no, no.


467
0:23:54,42 --> 0:23:56,5
So how goes the investigation?


468
0:23:56,5 --> 0:23:57,667
- Pretty routine.


469
0:23:57,667 --> 0:23:59,209
- Have you got
any more questions?


470
0:23:59,209 --> 0:24:0,459
I've got a ton of work.


471
0:24:0,459 --> 0:24:2,84
- Oh, no, that's all right,
Miss Wilson.


472
0:24:2,84 --> 0:24:6,875
That's all for now.


473
0:24:6,875 --> 0:24:8,125
Grace Wilson.


474
0:24:8,125 --> 0:24:9,834
Been with the hotel
a couple of months.


475
0:24:9,834 --> 0:24:13,75
Barmaid before that,
Dog and Duck in Holborn.


476
0:24:13,75 --> 0:24:16,375
She took that girl Celestine
her supper.


477
0:24:16,375 --> 0:24:19,84
First floor, please.


478
0:24:19,84 --> 0:24:21,584
- So tell me, Chief Inspector.


479
0:24:21,584 --> 0:24:29,292
What is it
that you have so far found out?


480
0:24:29,292 --> 0:24:31,584
- Grace Wilson or Celestine.


481
0:24:31,584 --> 0:24:34,125
The hotel maid
or the ladies' maid.


482
0:24:34,125 --> 0:24:35,959
Seems to me
it's got to be one of them.


483
0:24:35,959 --> 0:24:38,584
- A necklace in a box
within a chest, Chief Inspector,


484
0:24:38,584 --> 0:24:40,84
and only one key?


485
0:24:40,84 --> 0:24:52,917
It is as a magical trick.


486
0:24:52,917 --> 0:24:55,209
The necklace,
it was in this drawer?


487
0:24:55,209 --> 0:24:59,542
- That's right.


488
0:24:59,542 --> 0:25:1,292
- And this door?


489
0:25:1,292 --> 0:25:2,75
- Oh, that leads
to the maid's room.


490
0:25:2,75 --> 0:25:5,292
That's where Celestine went
to get the scissors and thread.


491
0:25:5,292 --> 0:25:8,0
- Leaving Grace alone
in the room.


492
0:25:8,0 --> 0:25:10,917
- Tell me, Hastings,
how long do you think


493
0:25:10,917 --> 0:25:12,75
it would have taken
Mademoiselle Celestine


494
0:25:12,75 --> 0:25:14,834
to retrieve the scissors
from that room?


495
0:25:14,834 --> 0:25:17,417
- Oh, I don't know.
20 seconds?


496
0:25:17,417 --> 0:25:19,417
- 20 seconds.


497
0:25:19,417 --> 0:25:20,625
And for how much of that time


498
0:25:20,625 --> 0:25:22,75
would she have been
out of this room?


499
0:25:22,75 --> 0:25:25,84
- Four or five seconds
at the most.


500
0:25:25,84 --> 0:25:29,84
- Exactement.


501
0:25:29,84 --> 0:25:31,667
And for
Mademoiselle Grace Wilson


502
0:25:31,667 --> 0:25:33,667
to open this drawer,
remove the box,


503
0:25:33,667 --> 0:25:35,417
somehow to unlock it,
open the box,


504
0:25:35,417 --> 0:25:37,625
take out the necklace,
close the box,


505
0:25:37,625 --> 0:25:39,125
and return it?


506
0:25:39,125 --> 0:25:41,25
- Well, she couldn't possibly
have had time.


507
0:25:41,25 --> 0:25:43,167
- I do not think so.


508
0:25:43,167 --> 0:25:45,84
- Right.


509
0:25:45,84 --> 0:25:47,125
Excuse me.


510
0:25:47,125 --> 0:25:49,167
- Where are you going,
Chief Inspector?


511
0:25:49,167 --> 0:25:55,334
- I think it's about time
I had Miss Celestine searched.


512
0:25:55,334 --> 0:26:4,25
- Can't imagine why
they didn't lock it.


513
0:26:4,25 --> 0:26:9,917
- This drawer runs easily,
Hastings.


514
0:26:9,917 --> 0:26:20,334
But not this one.


515
0:26:20,334 --> 0:26:23,459
C'est interessant.


516
0:26:23,459 --> 0:26:29,375
I wonder...


517
0:26:29,375 --> 0:26:32,875
- Well, that must interconnect
with the room next door.


518
0:26:32,875 --> 0:26:40,0
- It is bolted.


519
0:26:40,0 --> 0:26:42,5
Bolted on both sides.


520
0:26:42,5 --> 0:26:46,917
But, Hastings, we know who it is
who occupies this room.


521
0:26:46,917 --> 0:26:49,0
- Room 113?


522
0:26:49,0 --> 0:26:50,84
- Oui.


523
0:26:50,84 --> 0:26:54,0
His name, I think,
was Mr. Worthing.


524
0:26:54,0 --> 0:26:55,375
- That's right, sir.


525
0:26:55,375 --> 0:26:56,625
He was an American gent.


526
0:26:56,625 --> 0:26:57,917
He only stayed the night.


527
0:26:57,917 --> 0:27:0,375
Left this morning.


528
0:27:0,375 --> 0:27:2,5
- You saw him depart?


529
0:27:2,5 --> 0:27:3,667
- Oh, no, sir.


530
0:27:3,667 --> 0:27:5,667
Carried his own luggage.


531
0:27:5,667 --> 0:27:8,167
Must have left
at the crack of dawn.


532
0:27:8,167 --> 0:27:11,834
- You did not, by chance,
see him yesterday evening?


533
0:27:11,834 --> 0:27:14,584
- No, sir.


534
0:27:14,584 --> 0:27:17,0
I can tell you
who I did see, though, sir.


535
0:27:17,0 --> 0:27:19,959
Well, it was
just as I was leaving.


536
0:27:19,959 --> 0:27:22,709
Well, I don't want to talk
out of turn, sir,


537
0:27:22,709 --> 0:27:26,292
but, well, if there's a reward
and all that, well...


538
0:27:26,292 --> 0:27:28,125
- Please to continue.


539
0:27:28,125 --> 0:27:29,334
- Yeah.


540
0:27:29,334 --> 0:27:31,292
Well, that writer, Mr. Hall,


541
0:27:31,292 --> 0:27:33,834
he was hanging around
outside the hotel.


542
0:27:33,834 --> 0:27:38,209
Must have been about 11:00.


543
0:27:38,209 --> 0:27:46,75
- Outside?
- Yes, sir.


544
0:27:46,75 --> 0:27:48,834
- Would he have been
near to the window


545
0:27:48,834 --> 0:27:50,667
of Monsieur and Madame Opalsen?


546
0:27:50,667 --> 0:27:53,792
- Well, yes, sir.


547
0:27:53,792 --> 0:27:55,959
Right under it.


548
0:27:55,959 --> 0:28:10,375
- Thank you.


549
0:28:10,375 --> 0:28:11,792
- Well.


550
0:28:11,792 --> 0:28:25,5
Now, here's something
that shouldn't be here.


551
0:28:25,5 --> 0:28:27,75
- That's a duplicate key
to the jewel box.


552
0:28:27,75 --> 0:28:31,5
We found it hidden in the hem
of Celestine's petticoat.


553
0:28:31,5 --> 0:28:33,709
- Sounds pretty conclusive.


554
0:28:33,709 --> 0:28:35,209
But what about the necklace?


555
0:28:35,209 --> 0:28:36,334
- No sign of that yet.


556
0:28:36,334 --> 0:28:38,167
- Going up,
ladies and gentlemen.


557
0:28:38,167 --> 0:28:42,167
- But if you say her boyfriend
was seen


558
0:28:42,167 --> 0:28:47,167
outside the hotel last night...


559
0:28:47,167 --> 0:28:49,917
- Monsieur Hall?
He was here, yes.


560
0:28:49,917 --> 0:28:51,917
- Yes, well, that explains it,
doesn't it?


561
0:28:51,917 --> 0:28:53,667
- Explains what?


562
0:28:53,667 --> 0:28:55,417
- How she got the necklace
out of the hotel.


563
0:28:55,417 --> 0:28:56,584
She couldn't leave the room,


564
0:28:56,584 --> 0:28:58,334
so she simply dropped it
out of the window,


565
0:28:58,334 --> 0:28:59,584
and he was there to catch it.


566
0:28:59,584 --> 0:29:1,584
- You have arrested
Mademoiselle Celestine?


567
0:29:1,584 --> 0:29:10,5
- Yes, and the sooner we find
Andrew Hall, the better.


568
0:29:10,5 --> 0:29:12,84
Ah, Mr. Saunders.


569
0:29:12,84 --> 0:29:17,917
We want a word with you.


570
0:29:17,917 --> 0:29:20,667
- I hear you've already solved
the case, sir.


571
0:29:20,667 --> 0:29:23,334
- Never mind about that.
Have you seen Mr. Hall?


572
0:29:23,334 --> 0:29:24,917
- Mr. Hall, sir?


573
0:29:24,917 --> 0:29:27,334
I drove him to the race course.


574
0:29:27,334 --> 0:29:29,125
Is he in some sort of trouble,
sir?


575
0:29:29,125 --> 0:29:30,584
- He could be
in a lot of trouble.


576
0:29:30,584 --> 0:29:32,167
Why do you ask?


577
0:29:32,167 --> 0:29:36,834
- Well, he did seem
a little anxious.


578
0:29:36,834 --> 0:29:38,334
- I'm not surprised.


579
0:29:38,334 --> 0:29:40,875
Have you any idea
where we might find him?


580
0:29:40,875 --> 0:29:45,0
- Well, he always places
his bets with the same man,


581
0:29:45,0 --> 0:29:47,84
Harry Wax.


582
0:29:47,84 --> 0:29:50,542
- Harry Wax?


583
0:29:50,542 --> 0:30:13,625
- He's a bookie, sir.


584
0:30:13,625 --> 0:30:15,417
- Just the sort of place
I'd expect him to go.


585
0:30:15,417 --> 0:30:16,875
- What do you mean,
Chief Inspector?


586
0:30:16,875 --> 0:30:18,459
- A race course.


587
0:30:18,459 --> 0:30:21,84
This is where you'll find
every criminal element, Poirot.


588
0:30:21,84 --> 0:30:23,25
And what better place
to do this kind of business


589
0:30:23,25 --> 0:30:24,875
than in the middle of a crowd?


590
0:30:24,875 --> 0:30:26,209
I only hope we're not too late.


591
0:30:26,209 --> 0:30:27,75
We've got
all the entrances covered?


592
0:30:27,75 --> 0:30:28,792
- Yes, sir.
- Right.


593
0:30:28,792 --> 0:30:30,167
You lot come with me,


594
0:30:30,167 --> 0:30:32,334
and keep your eyes out
for a bookie called Harry Wax.


595
0:30:32,334 --> 0:30:33,375
All right, come on, lads.


596
0:30:33,375 --> 0:30:35,84
- Hastings, this is wrong.


597
0:30:35,84 --> 0:30:39,709
To Poirot, it makes no sense.


598
0:30:39,709 --> 0:30:43,25
- 45, 50,


599
0:30:43,25 --> 0:30:46,84
55, 60.


600
0:30:46,84 --> 0:30:48,125
- Next race is the...


601
0:30:48,125 --> 0:30:50,75
- Take six to four,
This Favorite,


602
0:30:50,75 --> 0:30:53,334
and four to one Balwon.


603
0:30:53,334 --> 0:30:59,0
Take six to...


604
0:30:59,0 --> 0:31:14,584
Take six to four--


605
0:31:14,584 --> 0:31:16,84
- You Harry Wax?
- Yeah.


606
0:31:16,84 --> 0:31:17,584
- Is there a tall,
blond-haired chap


607
0:31:17,584 --> 0:31:22,75
made a bet this morning?


608
0:31:22,75 --> 0:31:27,167
- Poirot!


609
0:31:27,167 --> 0:31:30,917
There's Mr. Worthing.
I could have sworn it.


610
0:31:30,917 --> 0:31:33,75
- Oi!


611
0:31:33,75 --> 0:31:38,875
There he is!


612
0:31:38,875 --> 0:31:46,0
Halt!


613
0:31:46,0 --> 0:31:50,334
- You can't come in here.


614
0:31:50,334 --> 0:31:55,209
- Stop him!
Stop him!


615
0:31:55,209 --> 0:31:59,667
Get him!


616
0:31:59,667 --> 0:32:4,959
- Come on.


617
0:32:4,959 --> 0:32:6,75
- Right.
Get him in the car.


618
0:32:6,75 --> 0:32:8,417
- All right, in the car.
Come on.


619
0:32:8,417 --> 0:32:10,75
- I'm afraid we got to him
just too late.


620
0:32:10,75 --> 0:32:13,42
But we found this and this.


621
0:32:13,42 --> 0:32:14,209
- The pearls.


622
0:32:14,209 --> 0:32:16,0
- No, just the pouch
they were kept in.


623
0:32:16,0 --> 0:32:17,209
Empty.


624
0:32:17,209 --> 0:32:53,542
- So what's happened
to the pearls?


625
0:32:53,542 --> 0:32:55,792
- You've got it all wrong,
Chief Inspector.


626
0:32:55,792 --> 0:32:59,625
- Ah, so I suppose you won
this lot on a horse, did you?


627
0:32:59,625 --> 0:33:1,125
- Yes.


628
0:33:1,125 --> 0:33:3,25
Laughing Boy came in
at seven to one.


629
0:33:3,25 --> 0:33:5,792
- Then why did you try and run
for it when you saw me?


630
0:33:5,792 --> 0:33:8,42
- I owe money.


631
0:33:8,42 --> 0:33:9,709
I've had a bad run


632
0:33:9,709 --> 0:33:11,75
and fell in
with some pretty bad company.


633
0:33:11,75 --> 0:33:13,459
Well, you saw
what they were like


634
0:33:13,459 --> 0:33:14,667
outside the theater.


635
0:33:14,667 --> 0:33:18,0
- Yes.


636
0:33:18,0 --> 0:33:22,167
- I didn't know who you were,
so...


637
0:33:22,167 --> 0:33:32,75
- How do you explain this?


638
0:33:32,75 --> 0:33:33,834
- I can't.


639
0:33:33,834 --> 0:33:35,167
I've never seen it before.


640
0:33:35,167 --> 0:33:36,417
- It was in your pocket.


641
0:33:36,417 --> 0:33:39,334
- Then somebody must have
put it there.


642
0:33:39,334 --> 0:33:43,375
- Chief Inspector?


643
0:33:43,375 --> 0:33:47,0
Monsieur Hall.


644
0:33:47,0 --> 0:33:50,875
Why did you not go to the party
of Monsieur Opalsen?


645
0:33:50,875 --> 0:33:52,5
- I've told you.


646
0:33:52,5 --> 0:33:54,292
I went for a walk.


647
0:33:54,292 --> 0:34:0,709
- And your walk took you back
to the Grand Metropolitan Hotel.


648
0:34:0,709 --> 0:34:6,542
- Yes.


649
0:34:6,542 --> 0:34:10,25
I wanted to see Celestine.


650
0:34:10,25 --> 0:34:11,792
I just needed to be with her.


651
0:34:11,792 --> 0:34:17,959
But then, when I saw
she wasn't alone,


652
0:34:17,959 --> 0:34:27,292
I went to bed.


653
0:34:27,292 --> 0:34:30,417
- Mr. Poirot,
you've got to believe me.


654
0:34:30,417 --> 0:34:32,834
I'd never seen that key before.


655
0:34:32,834 --> 0:34:34,25
Someone must have
hidden it there.


656
0:34:34,25 --> 0:34:37,209
- Now, now, now, now, now,
mon petit.


657
0:34:37,209 --> 0:34:39,834
Tell me, about Monsieur Hall,


658
0:34:39,834 --> 0:34:42,375
you know of his gambling?


659
0:34:42,375 --> 0:34:44,209
- Yes.


660
0:34:44,209 --> 0:34:48,42
I've tried to stop him,
but it's no good.


661
0:34:48,42 --> 0:34:50,167
It's like a disease.


662
0:34:50,167 --> 0:34:51,5
- And you are aware,
mademoiselle,


663
0:34:51,5 --> 0:34:53,125
that for the return
of these pearls,


664
0:34:53,125 --> 0:34:56,292
Monsieur Opalsen is offering
a reward most substantial?


665
0:34:56,292 --> 0:34:58,375
- Yes.


666
0:34:58,375 --> 0:35:1,875
But I didn't take them,
Mr. Poirot, I swear to you.


667
0:35:1,875 --> 0:35:5,875
- But nobody else came into
the room while you were there.


668
0:35:5,875 --> 0:35:8,5
- No,


669
0:35:8,5 --> 0:35:10,667
only the hotel maid.


670
0:35:10,667 --> 0:35:13,0
- Tell me,
Mademoiselle Celestine.


671
0:35:13,0 --> 0:35:19,459
Monsieur Hall,
how did you first meet?


672
0:35:19,459 --> 0:35:21,709
- It was at the theater.


673
0:35:21,709 --> 0:35:24,375
One of Mr. Opalsen's
productions.


674
0:35:24,375 --> 0:35:26,584
An Oscar Wilde.


675
0:35:26,584 --> 0:35:28,875
- Lady Windermere's Fan?


676
0:35:28,875 --> 0:35:32,84
- No.


677
0:35:32,84 --> 0:35:37,417
It was The Importance
of Being Earnest.


678
0:35:37,417 --> 0:35:45,334
- Of course.


679
0:35:45,334 --> 0:35:48,292
Hastings, I must contact
the good Miss Lemon in London.


680
0:35:48,292 --> 0:35:49,334
- What for?


681
0:35:49,334 --> 0:35:51,209
- This case, Hastings,
I begin to see the light.


682
0:35:51,209 --> 0:35:52,459
- I don't understand.


683
0:35:52,459 --> 0:35:54,42
- You heard
what the young lady said.


684
0:35:54,42 --> 0:35:55,125
- Oscar Wilde?


685
0:35:55,125 --> 0:35:57,42
- Exactement.


686
0:35:57,42 --> 0:36:22,834
Hastings, there is work
to be done.


687
0:36:22,834 --> 0:36:25,0
- Left to get married
about six months ago.


688
0:36:25,0 --> 0:36:42,167
- Really?


689
0:36:42,167 --> 0:36:43,917
- Good shooting,
Chief Inspector.


690
0:36:43,917 --> 0:36:45,625
- I used to go out
on Isleworth Marshes


691
0:36:45,625 --> 0:36:47,84
when I was a boy.


692
0:36:47,84 --> 0:36:49,42
Some things you never forget.


693
0:36:49,42 --> 0:36:51,459
- Well, I must say, it's nice
to have an evening off.


694
0:36:51,459 --> 0:36:52,959
- What's Poirot up to, then?


695
0:36:52,959 --> 0:36:54,84
- Thinking.


696
0:36:54,84 --> 0:36:55,417
- Oh.


697
0:36:55,417 --> 0:36:57,25
- This was meant to be a rest,
you know.


698
0:36:57,25 --> 0:37:1,167
Heaven knows what Miss Lemon's
going to say when she arrives.


699
0:37:1,167 --> 0:37:2,334
- Hello, sir.


700
0:37:2,334 --> 0:37:4,0
Evening, Chief Inspector.


701
0:37:4,0 --> 0:37:5,709
- Hello, Miss Wilson.


702
0:37:5,709 --> 0:37:7,625
- It's nice to see
the police is human too.


703
0:37:7,625 --> 0:37:10,84
That for your little boy?


704
0:37:10,84 --> 0:37:11,209
- Yes.


705
0:37:11,209 --> 0:37:12,584
- I'm glad I ran into you.


706
0:37:12,584 --> 0:37:14,375
There's something
I was wanting to tell you.


707
0:37:14,375 --> 0:37:15,667
- Oh, yes?
What's that?


708
0:37:15,667 --> 0:37:18,959
- Well, it may not mean nothing,
but it's that writer.


709
0:37:18,959 --> 0:37:20,25
- What about him?


710
0:37:20,25 --> 0:37:22,917
- Well, I saw him
in Mr. Opalsen's room


711
0:37:22,917 --> 0:37:25,84
day before
that necklace got swiped.


712
0:37:25,84 --> 0:37:26,584
He was there
when I did the cleaning.


713
0:37:26,584 --> 0:37:28,209
Said he was looking
for something,


714
0:37:28,209 --> 0:37:29,709
but I don't know.


715
0:37:29,709 --> 0:37:30,834
Anyway...


716
0:37:30,834 --> 0:37:44,125
- The day before.


717
0:37:44,125 --> 0:37:46,292
- Mr. Poirot?


718
0:37:46,292 --> 0:37:48,209
- Ah, Miss Lemon.


719
0:37:48,209 --> 0:37:49,75
Allow me to take your case.


720
0:37:49,75 --> 0:37:58,792
- Thank you.


721
0:37:58,792 --> 0:38:2,292
- Good morning, Miss Lemon.


722
0:38:2,292 --> 0:38:5,417
- I thought this was meant
to be a holiday,


723
0:38:5,417 --> 0:38:6,75
Captain Hastings.


724
0:38:6,75 --> 0:38:9,0
I'll talk to you later.


725
0:38:9,0 --> 0:38:16,209
- Poirot?


726
0:38:16,209 --> 0:38:17,959
What are you up to, Poirot?


727
0:38:17,959 --> 0:38:21,375
- Chief Inspector, you must make
an immediate arrest.


728
0:38:21,375 --> 0:38:23,584
- I've already made an arrest,
thank you very much.


729
0:38:23,584 --> 0:38:25,459
- Chief Inspector,
what if this case


730
0:38:25,459 --> 0:38:28,42
was not just a question of theft
but of fraud?


731
0:38:28,42 --> 0:38:31,292
And what also
if the pearls of the czar


732
0:38:31,292 --> 0:38:33,75
did not exist?


733
0:38:33,75 --> 0:38:35,792
- There's Mr. Opalsen.


734
0:38:35,792 --> 0:38:37,875
Can we have a statement,
please, sir?


735
0:38:37,875 --> 0:38:39,0
Can we have a statement?


736
0:38:39,0 --> 0:38:40,5
- Make a statement,
Chief Inspector.


737
0:38:40,5 --> 0:38:42,334
- Mr. Opalsen?


738
0:38:42,334 --> 0:38:43,625
- Poirot!


739
0:38:43,625 --> 0:38:45,625
How dare you?


740
0:38:45,625 --> 0:38:47,84
- But, Monsieur Opalsen,


741
0:38:47,84 --> 0:38:52,834
a man in your position needs
all the publicity he can get.


742
0:38:52,834 --> 0:38:54,167
- Mr. Opalsen.


743
0:38:54,167 --> 0:38:55,792
- Could you tell us
what's going on, sir?


744
0:38:55,792 --> 0:38:57,709
- Following our investigations,
we discovered


745
0:38:57,709 --> 0:38:59,584
that the necklace
that was stolen was a fake.


746
0:38:59,584 --> 0:39:1,84
There never were
any real pearls.


747
0:39:1,84 --> 0:39:2,625
- You mean he did it
for the insurance,


748
0:39:2,625 --> 0:39:3,709
Chief Inspector?


749
0:39:3,709 --> 0:39:5,584
- We are now investigating
the possibility


750
0:39:5,584 --> 0:39:6,834
of an insurance fraud.


751
0:39:6,834 --> 0:39:8,542
That's all I can tell you
for the present.


752
0:39:8,542 --> 0:39:9,667
Thank you.


753
0:39:9,667 --> 0:39:11,125
- One more question, sir.


754
0:39:11,125 --> 0:39:14,542
What made you think
the pearls were fake?


755
0:39:14,542 --> 0:39:24,25
- Mr. Opalsen?
- Mr. Opalsen.


756
0:39:24,25 --> 0:39:26,375
- Oh, yes, Inspector Drake
and I have worked together


757
0:39:26,375 --> 0:39:27,75
quite a lot recently.


758
0:39:27,75 --> 0:39:29,417
- Oh, here's Inspector Drake
coming now.


759
0:39:29,417 --> 0:39:31,5
Shh! Shh!
Good evening, sir.


760
0:39:31,5 --> 0:39:33,667
My lady will be here presently.


761
0:39:33,667 --> 0:39:35,625
- My dear Inspector.


762
0:39:35,625 --> 0:39:37,459
- Forgive me, Lady Jane,


763
0:39:37,459 --> 0:39:43,25
but I don't think
you should be wearing that.


764
0:39:43,25 --> 0:39:44,542
- The necklace?


765
0:39:44,542 --> 0:39:46,209
Whyever not?


766
0:39:46,209 --> 0:39:51,75
- Because the Phantom has sworn
he'll have it.


767
0:39:51,75 --> 0:39:56,42
And the Phantom
has never once failed.


768
0:39:56,42 --> 0:39:57,75
- Poirot.


769
0:39:57,75 --> 0:40:0,584
Why did you want
to see the play again?


770
0:40:0,584 --> 0:40:4,167
- Tomorrow the play travels
to New York, mon ami.


771
0:40:4,167 --> 0:40:5,5
- Yes?


772
0:40:5,5 --> 0:40:7,542
- Miss Lemon has yet
to see a performance.


773
0:40:7,542 --> 0:40:8,792
- Shh!


774
0:40:8,792 --> 0:40:21,292
- I mean to have him.


775
0:40:21,292 --> 0:40:38,667
- Good night, sir.


776
0:40:38,667 --> 0:40:41,375
- What are we doing here,
Poirot?


777
0:40:41,375 --> 0:40:43,917
The play is finished.


778
0:40:43,917 --> 0:40:47,75
- The play, it has finished,
yes, Hastings.


779
0:40:47,75 --> 0:40:51,42
But there is still
one more act.


780
0:40:51,42 --> 0:40:52,84
- I don't understand.


781
0:40:52,84 --> 0:40:53,959
- Ah, mon cher Hastings,


782
0:40:53,959 --> 0:40:56,84
the pearls so celebrated
of the czar,


783
0:40:56,84 --> 0:40:58,584
where do you think a market
could be found for them?


784
0:40:58,584 --> 0:41:0,5
- Well, I don't know.


785
0:41:0,5 --> 0:41:2,25
Somewhere on the Continent,
I suppose.


786
0:41:2,25 --> 0:41:3,917
- No, no, no, Hastings.


787
0:41:3,917 --> 0:41:6,625
And that is what Miss Lemon
discovered for me in London.


788
0:41:6,625 --> 0:41:8,375
- They're just too well known
over here.


789
0:41:8,375 --> 0:41:9,625
No one would touch them.


790
0:41:9,625 --> 0:41:11,5
- In America, then?


791
0:41:11,5 --> 0:41:13,42
- Exactement.


792
0:41:13,42 --> 0:41:15,0
And with everyone searching
for them,


793
0:41:15,0 --> 0:41:25,75
what would be the best way
to smuggle them abroad?


794
0:41:25,75 --> 0:41:28,25
- Well, of course,
in among the scenery and props


795
0:41:28,25 --> 0:41:29,334
for the play.


796
0:41:29,334 --> 0:41:30,625
- Oui.


797
0:41:30,625 --> 0:41:32,542
- You mean they're here
somewhere?


798
0:41:32,542 --> 0:41:33,667
- Oui.


799
0:41:33,667 --> 0:41:34,75
- Well, where?


800
0:41:34,75 --> 0:41:36,792
And who put them here?


801
0:41:36,792 --> 0:41:38,709
- This case,
it has been most curious,


802
0:41:38,709 --> 0:41:40,375
n'est-ce pas, Chief Inspector?


803
0:41:40,375 --> 0:41:44,84
From the start,
there were only two people


804
0:41:44,84 --> 0:41:45,959
who could possibly have stolen
those pearls


805
0:41:45,959 --> 0:41:47,5
of Monsieur Opalsen:


806
0:41:47,5 --> 0:41:50,417
Mademoiselle Celestine


807
0:41:50,417 --> 0:41:54,375
or Mademoiselle Grace Wilson,
the hotel maid.


808
0:41:54,375 --> 0:41:55,834
- Well, it must have been
Celestine.


809
0:41:55,834 --> 0:41:56,959
She had the key.


810
0:41:56,959 --> 0:41:58,917
It was sewn into her petticoat.


811
0:41:58,917 --> 0:42:1,25
- It has always puzzled me,
that, Hastings.


812
0:42:1,25 --> 0:42:2,667
Why keep the key?


813
0:42:2,667 --> 0:42:4,917
It was so needless, so clumsy.


814
0:42:4,917 --> 0:42:6,959
- Are you saying it was planted?


815
0:42:6,959 --> 0:42:8,375
- Yes, of course.


816
0:42:8,375 --> 0:42:11,459
- Well, if it wasn't Celestine,
it must have been Grace.


817
0:42:11,459 --> 0:42:13,917
But we know that she didn't
have time to take the pearls.


818
0:42:13,917 --> 0:42:15,42
You said so yourself.


819
0:42:15,42 --> 0:42:16,875
- It is a riddle, is it not,
Hastings?


820
0:42:16,875 --> 0:42:25,959
- So which of them was it?


821
0:42:25,959 --> 0:42:29,334
- Let us imagine.


822
0:42:29,334 --> 0:42:34,125
Mademoiselle Grace Wilson is
in the room of Monsieur Opalsen.


823
0:42:34,125 --> 0:42:36,167
She is there
only to be friendly.


824
0:42:36,167 --> 0:42:37,417
- I can get you some,
if you like.


825
0:42:37,417 --> 0:42:38,584
- No, it's all right.


826
0:42:38,584 --> 0:42:40,334
- The moment
that Mademoiselle Celestine


827
0:42:40,334 --> 0:42:42,42
leaves the room
to retrieve the scissors,


828
0:42:42,42 --> 0:42:53,542
as quick as a flash, she acts.


829
0:42:53,542 --> 0:42:56,125
She was able to execute
the theft of the pearls


830
0:42:56,125 --> 0:42:57,917
in an instant,


831
0:42:57,917 --> 0:43:0,875
because she did not need
to unlock the box herself.


832
0:43:0,875 --> 0:43:3,959
She had in the adjoining room
an accomplice


833
0:43:3,959 --> 0:43:5,75
with a duplicate key,


834
0:43:5,75 --> 0:43:13,125
and it was he who removed
the pouch and the pearls.


835
0:43:13,125 --> 0:43:16,292
- Mr. Worthing.


836
0:43:16,292 --> 0:43:19,292
- Exactement, Hastings.


837
0:43:19,292 --> 0:43:21,334
And when Mademoiselle Celestine
leaves the room


838
0:43:21,334 --> 0:43:24,125
for the second time,
this time for some thread,


839
0:43:24,125 --> 0:43:31,459
the box, it is returned
in exactly the same manner.


840
0:43:31,459 --> 0:43:36,42
Only now, the necklace,
it has gone.


841
0:43:36,42 --> 0:43:39,25
- And I suppose it was
this mysterious Mr. Worthing


842
0:43:39,25 --> 0:43:42,584
who hid the key
in Celestine's petticoat.


843
0:43:42,584 --> 0:43:45,709
- He or his accomplice,
Chief Inspector, yes.


844
0:43:45,709 --> 0:43:49,42
But it was definitely
Monsieur Worthing


845
0:43:49,42 --> 0:43:50,834
who placed into the pocket
of Monsieur Hall


846
0:43:50,834 --> 0:43:54,417
the pouch which was empty.


847
0:43:54,417 --> 0:43:55,459
- Poirot!


848
0:43:55,459 --> 0:43:56,5
That's right.


849
0:43:56,5 --> 0:43:57,917
I saw him at the race course.


850
0:43:57,917 --> 0:44:0,584
There's Mr. Worthing.
I could have sworn it.


851
0:44:0,584 --> 0:44:2,292
But who is he?


852
0:44:2,292 --> 0:44:13,125
Who is this Mr. Worthing?


853
0:44:13,125 --> 0:44:14,875
Mr. Poirot.


854
0:44:14,875 --> 0:44:19,584
- Shh.


855
0:44:19,584 --> 0:44:48,625
- Shh.
Wait there.


856
0:44:48,625 --> 0:44:51,709
- It is a pleasure
to meet you at last,


857
0:44:51,709 --> 0:45:0,584
Mr. Worthing.


858
0:45:0,584 --> 0:45:5,417
- Saunders.


859
0:45:5,417 --> 0:45:7,709
- Let go!


860
0:45:7,709 --> 0:45:9,709
Get off me!
I done nothing wrong!


861
0:45:9,709 --> 0:45:11,834
Let go of me!


862
0:45:11,834 --> 0:45:24,709
Oh, God.


863
0:45:24,709 --> 0:45:26,625
You bloody fool.


864
0:45:26,625 --> 0:45:28,459
I told you
we shouldn't ought to have come.


865
0:45:28,459 --> 0:45:31,667
- But I think it is too late
for that, Madame Saunders.


866
0:45:31,667 --> 0:45:34,167
- Madame--what, you mean
they're married?


867
0:45:34,167 --> 0:45:36,209
- Yes, of course,
Chief Inspector.


868
0:45:36,209 --> 0:45:38,459
It was that that Miss Lemon
discovered for me


869
0:45:38,459 --> 0:45:39,917
at the Dog and the Duck
in Holborn.


870
0:45:39,917 --> 0:45:41,459
- Grace Saunders.


871
0:45:41,459 --> 0:45:43,959
The landlord
remembered her well.


872
0:45:43,959 --> 0:45:46,584
- But why the disguise?


873
0:45:46,584 --> 0:45:49,125
- Ah, Hastings.


874
0:45:49,125 --> 0:45:51,75
How else could Monsieur Saunders
reserve for himself


875
0:45:51,75 --> 0:45:54,25
a room next door
to Monsieur Opalsen?


876
0:45:54,25 --> 0:45:58,375
He had to assume a new identity.


877
0:45:58,375 --> 0:46:1,209
- How could you possibly know?


878
0:46:1,209 --> 0:46:5,25
- As ever, Monsieur, it was
the little details,


879
0:46:5,25 --> 0:46:7,167
the matters of no consequence


880
0:46:7,167 --> 0:46:9,5
that caught the attention
of Poirot.


881
0:46:9,5 --> 0:46:13,25
You will recall, Hastings,
on the night of the theft,


882
0:46:13,25 --> 0:46:14,75
that I remarked
on some white powder


883
0:46:14,75 --> 0:46:16,875
on the sleeve
of Monsieur Saunders.


884
0:46:16,875 --> 0:46:20,292
Pardon.
You will forgive me?


885
0:46:20,292 --> 0:46:22,417
- I thought
it was talcum powder.


886
0:46:22,417 --> 0:46:24,875
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Not at all.


887
0:46:24,875 --> 0:46:26,667
No, Hastings,
it was not the talcum powder.


888
0:46:26,667 --> 0:46:29,542
It was the French chalk,
which cabinetmaker use


889
0:46:29,542 --> 0:46:32,0
to let the drawers made of wood
run more smoothly


890
0:46:32,0 --> 0:46:34,834
and with which Monsieur Worthing
prepared beforehand


891
0:46:34,834 --> 0:46:39,542
the drawer
containing the pearls.


892
0:46:39,542 --> 0:46:42,292
But I was suspicious
of Mr. Worthing


893
0:46:42,292 --> 0:46:43,709
long before this.


894
0:46:43,709 --> 0:46:45,417
- Your key, Mr. Worthing.


895
0:46:45,417 --> 0:46:46,667
- When Hastings and myself,


896
0:46:46,667 --> 0:46:48,792
we first came
to the Grand Metropolitan Hotel,


897
0:46:48,792 --> 0:46:50,792
there was a man at the desk.


898
0:46:50,792 --> 0:46:54,417
He was elderly.
He must walk with a stick.


899
0:46:54,417 --> 0:46:55,917
- Thank you.


900
0:46:55,917 --> 0:46:59,209
- But when he goes to his room,
which is on the first floor,


901
0:46:59,209 --> 0:47:2,584
he proceeds not to the lift
that is waiting, no,


902
0:47:2,584 --> 0:47:11,417
but to the staircase.


903
0:47:11,417 --> 0:47:13,834
It was a performance, Monsieur,


904
0:47:13,834 --> 0:47:20,459
but a performance that,
to Poirot, did not ring true.


905
0:47:20,459 --> 0:47:22,167
- Damn you.


906
0:47:22,167 --> 0:47:23,459
- That's enough of that.


907
0:47:23,459 --> 0:47:34,25
Take him away.


908
0:47:34,25 --> 0:47:35,459
- One thing, Poirot.


909
0:47:35,459 --> 0:47:37,375
I know you were waiting
for them,


910
0:47:37,375 --> 0:47:38,917
but why did you think
they'd come here?


911
0:47:38,917 --> 0:47:41,542
- They came here, Hastings,
to retrieve the necklace.


912
0:47:41,542 --> 0:47:45,959
- I see.


913
0:47:45,959 --> 0:47:47,959
Where is the necklace?


914
0:47:47,959 --> 0:47:50,42
- The necklace, Hastings?


915
0:47:50,42 --> 0:48:15,459
It is, I think...


916
0:48:15,459 --> 0:48:22,917
Voila.


917
0:48:22,917 --> 0:48:25,209
- Damn Poirot!


918
0:48:25,209 --> 0:48:28,375
You mean that bloody little man
set me up?


919
0:48:28,375 --> 0:48:30,167
- It's your own fault.


920
0:48:30,167 --> 0:48:31,75
You tried to use him.


921
0:48:31,75 --> 0:48:33,75
- But, Margaret,
what about the pearls?


922
0:48:33,75 --> 0:48:35,917
- Don't worry.


923
0:48:35,917 --> 0:48:49,125
That "bloody little man"
got them back.


924
0:48:49,125 --> 0:48:52,625
- So you made up the story
about the fake pearls


925
0:48:52,625 --> 0:48:54,167
to smoke out the thieves.


926
0:48:54,167 --> 0:48:55,417
- Hmm.


927
0:48:55,417 --> 0:48:57,667
So now you learn the plot
of your next play,


928
0:48:57,667 --> 0:48:59,375
Monsieur Hall.


929
0:48:59,375 --> 0:49:2,0
Yes, I told to them
that the necklace, it was false,


930
0:49:2,0 --> 0:49:4,792
because I knew that they would
then have to examine it.


931
0:49:4,792 --> 0:49:6,209
- We're all packed, Mr. Poirot.


932
0:49:6,209 --> 0:49:7,542
- Thank you, Miss Lemon.


933
0:49:7,542 --> 0:49:9,334
- The reward, Mr. Poirot.


934
0:49:9,334 --> 0:49:10,375
It should be yours.


935
0:49:10,375 --> 0:49:12,125
Why have you given it to me?


936
0:49:12,125 --> 0:49:13,5
- Because, Mademoiselle,


937
0:49:13,5 --> 0:49:16,792
it was you who told to me
the title of the play


938
0:49:16,792 --> 0:49:19,459
The Importance
of Being Earnest.


939
0:49:19,459 --> 0:49:21,834
And there is in that play
a character


940
0:49:21,834 --> 0:49:24,417
that is very well known
who is called...


941
0:49:24,417 --> 0:49:25,459
- Jack Worthing.


942
0:49:25,459 --> 0:49:26,584
- C'est ca.


943
0:49:26,584 --> 0:49:29,42
And it was then that I saw
the light.


944
0:49:29,42 --> 0:49:36,75
So the reward, I think,
must be for you.


945
0:49:36,75 --> 0:49:50,25
Miss Lemon?
Hastings?


946
0:49:50,25 --> 0:49:53,209
- So much for your holiday,
Mr. Poirot.


947
0:49:53,209 --> 0:49:55,334
- But, Miss Lemon,
I feel completely refreshed.


948
0:49:55,334 --> 0:49:57,709
- Even so, this wasn't
what the doctor ordered.


949
0:49:57,709 --> 0:50:5,292
- Daily Echo!
Daily Echo!


950
0:50:5,292 --> 0:50:7,167
- You are Lucky Len
of the Daily Echo,


951
0:50:7,167 --> 0:50:9,959
and I claim my ten guineas.


952
0:50:9,959 --> 0:50:12,75
- You're right.
I was Lucky Len.


953
0:50:12,75 --> 0:50:15,0
But I'm sorry;
I got fired this morning.


954
0:50:15,0 --> 0:50:17,375
- Fired?
Why?


955
0:50:17,375 --> 0:50:19,334
- Too many people
were recognizing me.


956
0:50:19,334 --> 0:50:22,25
The paper decided
it must be my face.


957
0:50:22,25 --> 0:50:24,584
It's too common.


958
0:50:24,584 --> 0:50:25,625
- Common?


959
0:50:25,625 --> 0:50:26,792
- That's what they said.


960
0:50:26,792 --> 0:50:28,75
Bit of a cheek, if you ask me.


961
0:50:28,75 --> 0:50:29,875
But there you are.


962
0:50:29,875 --> 0:50:31,375
