not yet known to us humans,
lived a tiny and complex

One day, Bub decided to leave
her planet and venture off

LARA SPENCER: All right,
here we go.


15

It is finally time to meet Bub,
a kitten born the runt of


16
0:1:7,61 --> 0:1:9,89
the litter, who is now the
toast of the internet.


17
0:1:9,89 --> 0:1:12,34
Yeah, she's toothless,
stubby-legged, extra-toed and,


18
0:1:12,34 --> 0:1:14,78
perhaps, I dare say, the cutest
cat in the world.


19
0:1:14,78 --> 0:1:16,58
- This is a normal
cat's pelvis.


20
0:1:16,58 --> 0:1:18,15
This is Bub's pelvis.


21
0:1:18,15 --> 0:1:22,21
A normal cat would have nice,
straight bones that have a


22
0:1:22,21 --> 0:1:25,57
darker marrow cavity,
compared to Bub.


23
0:1:25,57 --> 0:1:30,34
There's no marrow cavity, and,
of course, there's no twisting


24
0:1:30,34 --> 0:1:32,64
and deformity of the bones.

she was amazing.

I took her home.


28

I posted pictures of her
on the internet.

And then that one photo
just, like, blew up.

incredibly unique cat doing


37
0:2:3,3 --> 0:2:5,41
weird things.

- If we look at human life
through a cat's eyes, does so

0:2:9,36 --> 0:2:11,91
much of what we do
seem futile?

decade for crazy cat people

then let it be now.
