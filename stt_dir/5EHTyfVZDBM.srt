1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:12,48



2
0:0:12,48 --> 0:0:14,71
EDDY MORETTI: Look at that.


3
0:0:14,71 --> 0:0:15,96
Jesus!


4
0:0:15,96 --> 0:0:18,28



5
0:0:18,28 --> 0:0:20,385
Another oil refinery.


6
0:0:20,385 --> 0:0:24,59



7
0:0:24,59 --> 0:0:27,22
I wonder how far we could get
before they send the little


8
0:0:27,22 --> 0:0:31,13
surveillance vehicle to see
what the fuck we're doing.


9
0:0:31,13 --> 0:0:31,81
Do you mind?


10
0:0:31,81 --> 0:0:33,6
Do we care?


11
0:0:33,6 --> 0:0:35,37



12
0:0:35,37 --> 0:0:39,68
SIMON DYER: How we our energy
and how we do and how we


13
0:0:39,68 --> 0:0:42,4
impact the environment in
getting that energy I think is


14
0:0:42,4 --> 0:0:44,2
the issue of our times.


15
0:0:44,2 --> 0:0:48,0
And the Alberta oil sands
represent the very worst in


16
0:0:48,0 --> 0:0:50,49
terms of our desire
to extract oil.


17
0:0:50,49 --> 0:0:52,97
You know basically go to
any length with it.


18
0:0:52,97 --> 0:0:54,22
EDDY MORETTI: My heiny
is freezing.


19
0:0:54,22 --> 0:1:2,73



20
0:1:2,73 --> 0:1:5,74
When people think of oil they
think of the Middle East but


21
0:1:5,74 --> 0:1:8,13
actually Canada has one of
the largest petroleum


22
0:1:8,13 --> 0:1:8,99
deposits in the world.


23
0:1:8,99 --> 0:1:11,98
It's just that it's
stuck in sand.


24
0:1:11,98 --> 0:1:15,86
The oil sands is an area the
size of Florida and it holds


25
0:1:15,86 --> 0:1:19,83
an estimated 1.7 to 2.5 trillion
barrels of oil.


26
0:1:19,83 --> 0:1:22,91
However, until recently, it's
been way too expensive to


27
0:1:22,91 --> 0:1:24,446
extract from the sand.


28
0:1:24,446 --> 0:1:27,97
LINDSAY TELFER: It's the most
difficult to access oil in the


29
0:1:27,97 --> 0:1:31,71
world and that's why it's never
been seen as a viable


30
0:1:31,71 --> 0:1:33,9
option in the global
oil economy.


31
0:1:33,9 --> 0:1:37,67
But because the oil prices have
gone up so much, likely


32
0:1:37,67 --> 0:1:40,33
because we've hit peak oil,
all of a sudden the most


33
0:1:40,33 --> 0:1:43,52
difficult to access oil in
the world has now become


34
0:1:43,52 --> 0:1:44,39
accessible.


35
0:1:44,39 --> 0:1:45,86
So peak oil is--


36
0:1:45,86 --> 0:1:49,51
in it's very simple terms, it's
exactly what it says.


37
0:1:49,51 --> 0:1:55,68
You hit a peak of production of
available oil reserves and


38
0:1:55,68 --> 0:1:57,67
once you've hit that peak
you start going down.


39
0:1:57,67 --> 0:2:1,48
So it's the reserves in the
world are declining.


40
0:2:1,48 --> 0:2:3,55
SIMON DYER: Companies and
countries are realizing


41
0:2:3,55 --> 0:2:6,12
strategically they're trying to
figure out where this oil


42
0:2:6,12 --> 0:2:8,62
is going to come from as
sources elsewhere in


43
0:2:8,62 --> 0:2:9,8
the world dry up.


44
0:2:9,8 --> 0:2:14,26
So Canada is considered a safe,
secure source of oil.


45
0:2:14,26 --> 0:2:16,61
And all the major
oil companies--


46
0:2:16,61 --> 0:2:18,34
all the multinationals
in the world have


47
0:2:18,34 --> 0:2:19,905
operations in the oil sand.


48
0:2:19,905 --> 0:2:22,94
And you're seeing that stampede
to try and ensure


49
0:2:22,94 --> 0:2:25,71
that they get a piece
of the pie.


50
0:2:25,71 --> 0:2:28,52
EDDY MORETTI: We made our way
for Fort McMurray, a small


51
0:2:28,52 --> 0:2:31,6
town in the middle of Canada's
tundra that is the epicenter


52
0:2:31,6 --> 0:2:34,46
of the oil sands operation.


53
0:2:34,46 --> 0:2:38,8
When we were there we realized
that this little town has


54
0:2:38,8 --> 0:2:40,76
global consequences.


55
0:2:40,76 --> 0:2:44,49
Fort McMurray is responsible
for two-thirds of Canada's


56
0:2:44,49 --> 0:2:48,12
contribution to global
greenhouse gas emissions which


57
0:2:48,12 --> 0:2:50,94
is kind of amazing when you
think that it's a town of


58
0:2:50,94 --> 0:2:54,17
70,000 people.


59
0:2:54,17 --> 0:2:57,35
The problem's so big, it's so
massive, affects so many


60
0:2:57,35 --> 0:3:0,67
different people environmentally
and socially.


61
0:3:0,67 --> 0:3:3,84
We basically tried to cover the
story from as many angles


62
0:3:3,84 --> 0:3:7,87
as we could and we realized
that it was inexhaustible.


63
0:3:7,87 --> 0:3:9,71
We met the chief of
the Athabaskan


64
0:3:9,71 --> 0:3:11,66
Region First Nation.


65
0:3:11,66 --> 0:3:14,73
We met the Premier of Alberta,
which is like the governor.


66
0:3:14,73 --> 0:3:17,88
We also visited the work camps,
saw the pipeline that's


67
0:3:17,88 --> 0:3:19,92
being built all the
way to Chicago.


68
0:3:19,92 --> 0:3:22,94
We saw how they rip up the
forest in order to discover


69
0:3:22,94 --> 0:3:24,285
and explore for this oil.


70
0:3:24,285 --> 0:3:27,61



71
0:3:27,61 --> 0:3:30,63
We also snuck onto some
of these sites.


72
0:3:30,63 --> 0:3:33,3
And the snow is really
fucking deep here.


73
0:3:33,3 --> 0:3:34,94
Be careful.


74
0:3:34,94 --> 0:3:35,27
OK.


75
0:3:35,27 --> 0:3:36,89
Here we go.


76
0:3:36,89 --> 0:3:39,8
This is it.


77
0:3:39,8 --> 0:3:40,76
Welcome to Alberta.


78
0:3:40,76 --> 0:3:44,84
Welcome to the future of oil.


79
0:3:44,84 --> 0:3:46,9
It sucks.


80
0:3:46,9 --> 0:3:53,7



81
0:3:53,7 --> 0:3:55,106
It really fucking sucks.


82
0:3:55,106 --> 0:3:56,77
And it wreaks.


83
0:3:56,77 --> 0:3:58,2
It smells.


84
0:3:58,2 --> 0:4:0,5



85
0:4:0,5 --> 0:4:3,14
So we came all the way from
New York because we heard


86
0:4:3,14 --> 0:4:5,0
there's a lot of oil here.


87
0:4:5,0 --> 0:4:6,85
LINDSAY TELFER: I guess the
other angle is scraping at the


88
0:4:6,85 --> 0:4:7,81
bottom of the barrel.


89
0:4:7,81 --> 0:4:10,52
It is the dirtiest to produce
oil in the world.


90
0:4:10,52 --> 0:4:13,73
The oil sands industry in Canada
make up the single


91
0:4:13,73 --> 0:4:16,363
largest contributor to our
growing greenhouse gas


92
0:4:16,363 --> 0:4:18,79
emissions in Canada.


93
0:4:18,79 --> 0:4:19,69
EDDY MORETTI: The first thing
you need to understand is how


94
0:4:19,69 --> 0:4:22,98
they extract the oil
from the sand.


95
0:4:22,98 --> 0:4:25,85
First they clear out the trees
and mine the sand that's close


96
0:4:25,85 --> 0:4:27,59
to the surface.


97
0:4:27,59 --> 0:4:31,0
But some of the sand is deeper
and to get to that they've


98
0:4:31,0 --> 0:4:32,76
invented a new system.


99
0:4:32,76 --> 0:4:37,31
It's called SAGD, or steam
assisted gravity drainage.


100
0:4:37,31 --> 0:4:41,38
Basically they heat the soil
and suck out the sand.


101
0:4:41,38 --> 0:4:44,12
SIMON DYER: The use of water
for in situ operations is a


102
0:4:44,12 --> 0:4:45,21
real concern.


103
0:4:45,21 --> 0:4:48,5
Companies use about a fifth of
a barrel of water for every


104
0:4:48,5 --> 0:4:52,44
barrel of oil produced
in situ operations.


105
0:4:52,44 --> 0:4:53,37
Oil sands companies--


106
0:4:53,37 --> 0:4:57,66
oil sands mines basically
extract water directly from


107
0:4:57,66 --> 0:4:58,73
the Athabasca River.


108
0:4:58,73 --> 0:5:0,89
Because the process, of course,
pollutes that water so


109
0:5:0,89 --> 0:5:3,6
much, it's largely not actually
returned to the


110
0:5:3,6 --> 0:5:4,7
Athabasca River.


111
0:5:4,7 --> 0:5:6,25
The vast majority of
it gets dumped into


112
0:5:6,25 --> 0:5:7,75
these tailings ponds.


113
0:5:7,75 --> 0:5:12,4
So these are basically oily
lagoons full of waste water


114
0:5:12,4 --> 0:5:14,51
and suspended hydrocarbons.


115
0:5:14,51 --> 0:5:18,6
If you ever get a chance to tour
an oil sands mine these


116
0:5:18,6 --> 0:5:19,57
landscapes are quite surreal.


117
0:5:19,57 --> 0:5:21,8
EDDY MORETTI: Once they've dug
up all the oil sand, they


118
0:5:21,8 --> 0:5:25,97
stick it in these huge cokers,
which are like large furnaces


119
0:5:25,97 --> 0:5:28,77
and boil it, and steam
inject it.


120
0:5:28,77 --> 0:5:30,94
That's how they get the
oil out of the sand.


121
0:5:30,94 --> 0:5:33,44
And this is the process where
all the greenhouse gas


122
0:5:33,44 --> 0:5:35,63
emissions come from.


123
0:5:35,63 --> 0:5:39,11
LINDSAY TELFER: Really, the only
real way to get the oil


124
0:5:39,11 --> 0:5:41,9
sands to eliminate their carbon
dioxide emissions is to


125
0:5:41,9 --> 0:5:44,98
stop producing the oil
from the oil sands.


126
0:5:44,98 --> 0:5:47,75
EDDY MORETTI: And is
that your position?


127
0:5:47,75 --> 0:5:49,55
LINDSAY TELFER: We need
to slow down.


128
0:5:49,55 --> 0:5:53,48
But I also recognize that it's
not going to stop tomorrow.


129
0:5:53,48 --> 0:5:54,75
Our communities can't
keep pace.


130
0:5:54,75 --> 0:5:56,45
Our environment can't
keep pace.


131
0:5:56,45 --> 0:5:57,58
We know we need to slow down.


132
0:5:57,58 --> 0:6:0,49
I think that that in itself
is very clear.


133
0:6:0,49 --> 0:6:3,47
EDDY MORETTI: And who's
pressuring us to ramp up?


134
0:6:3,47 --> 0:6:4,56
LINDSAY TELFER: Industry.


135
0:6:4,56 --> 0:6:5,99
Government.


136
0:6:5,99 --> 0:6:8,12
I mean the Alberta government
makes a lot of money on the


137
0:6:8,12 --> 0:6:11,79
oil sands so until there is a
viable alternative for them to


138
0:6:11,79 --> 0:6:16,71
shift our economy I think that
they're going to continue to


139
0:6:16,71 --> 0:6:21,1
create the climate that's going
to attract this kind of


140
0:6:21,1 --> 0:6:22,26
business to the province.


141
0:6:22,26 --> 0:6:27,22



142
0:6:27,22 --> 0:6:29,11
EDDY MORETTI: We went to go ask
for permission but there


143
0:6:29,11 --> 0:6:31,53
was no one in the office.


144
0:6:31,53 --> 0:6:36,6
And there are a couple
of trees here.


145
0:6:36,6 --> 0:6:39,73
A couple of rows of
a couple of trees.


146
0:6:39,73 --> 0:6:47,15
One, two, three, four, seven,
nine, ten, a million.


147
0:6:47,15 --> 0:6:52,11
Logs, logs, log, log,
log, log, logs.


148
0:6:52,11 --> 0:6:54,53
It's dangerous being a logger.


149
0:6:54,53 --> 0:6:57,12
But we don't know how
they cut them.


150
0:6:57,12 --> 0:6:59,58
If they're chainsaws or if
they're those tree snipper


151
0:6:59,58 --> 0:7:3,62
things where they
just snip it.


152
0:7:3,62 --> 0:7:4,87
Then again, what do I know?


153
0:7:4,87 --> 0:7:7,32



154
0:7:7,32 --> 0:7:9,78
LINDSAY TELFER: Boreal forests
are the lungs of Canada.


155
0:7:9,78 --> 0:7:11,12
It's what cleans our air.


156
0:7:11,12 --> 0:7:15,24
It's what gives us the air
that we can breathe.


157
0:7:15,24 --> 0:7:18,55
If you compare it to the Amazon
forest which is often


158
0:7:18,55 --> 0:7:22,55
called the lungs of the earth,
the Boreal forest is largely


159
0:7:22,55 --> 0:7:24,41
the lungs of North America


160
0:7:24,41 --> 0:7:24,68
EDDY MORETTI: So we
kind of need it?


161
0:7:24,68 --> 0:7:25,48
LINDSAY TELFER: And it's
the largest intact


162
0:7:25,48 --> 0:7:26,73
forest left in the world.


163
0:7:26,73 --> 0:7:34,328



164
0:7:34,328 --> 0:7:34,811
EDDY MORETTI: Holy shit!


165
0:7:34,811 --> 0:7:38,192
Look at that thing!


166
0:7:38,192 --> 0:7:40,77
What are the odds of there
being oil here?


167
0:7:40,77 --> 0:7:41,15
MALE SPEAKER: Very good.


168
0:7:41,15 --> 0:7:41,75
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah?


169
0:7:41,75 --> 0:7:41,98
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


170
0:7:41,98 --> 0:7:43,23
That's why we're doing it.


171
0:7:43,23 --> 0:7:48,4



172
0:7:48,4 --> 0:7:49,53
EDDY MORETTI: So they
just cut, cut,


173
0:7:49,53 --> 0:7:51,75
cut, cut their grids?


174
0:7:51,75 --> 0:7:51,43
MALE SPEAKER: That's right.


175
0:7:51,43 --> 0:7:54,63
EDDY MORETTI: And then another
crew comes in.


176
0:7:54,63 --> 0:7:57,84
Do you consider yourself an
environmentalist of sorts?


177
0:7:57,84 --> 0:7:58,18
MALE SPEAKER: Definitely.


178
0:7:58,18 --> 0:7:58,61
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


179
0:7:58,61 --> 0:8:0,57
MALE SPEAKER: Oh yeah,
you betcha.


180
0:8:0,57 --> 0:8:4,95
EDDY MORETTI: So you have no
major concerns with the way


181
0:8:4,95 --> 0:8:6,84
this business is operating?


182
0:8:6,84 --> 0:8:9,69
MALE SPEAKER: Well before we can
even cut down a tree, we


183
0:8:9,69 --> 0:8:11,46
have to get government
approval.


184
0:8:11,46 --> 0:8:14,74
One of the major focuses in
this industry is on the


185
0:8:14,74 --> 0:8:17,69
environment because that's
a key asset to


186
0:8:17,69 --> 0:8:19,9
what we do out here.


187
0:8:19,9 --> 0:8:21,81
EDDY MORETTI: Do you think then
these lines that have


188
0:8:21,81 --> 0:8:24,74
been mulched will get replanted
or what will happen?


189
0:8:24,74 --> 0:8:25,78
MALE SPEAKER: Someday,
I'm sure.


190
0:8:25,78 --> 0:8:29,87
There's always tree planting
that's going on


191
0:8:29,87 --> 0:8:31,74
throughout the province.


192
0:8:31,74 --> 0:8:34,169
EDDY MORETTI: They just have to
catch up to the other guys.


193
0:8:34,169 --> 0:8:39,482



194
0:8:39,482 --> 0:8:42,179
FRANK ROUTHIER:


195
0:8:42,179 --> 0:8:43,442
EDDY MORETTI: What happens
when there's no more oil?


196
0:8:43,442 --> 0:8:49,32
FRANK ROUTHIER:


197
0:8:49,32 --> 0:8:50,9
EDDY MORETTI: Are you going to
work in this business until


198
0:8:50,9 --> 0:8:52,2
you retire?


199
0:8:52,2 --> 0:9:2,2
FRANK ROUTHIER: And at
my age, my age--


200
0:9:2,2 --> 0:9:3,56
I'm not that old, guys!


201
0:9:3,56 --> 0:9:26,29



202
0:9:26,29 --> 0:9:28,95
EDDY MORETTI: Can you tell
us how much you make?


203
0:9:28,95 --> 0:9:30,2
FRANK ROUTHIER: How
much I make?


204
0:9:30,2 --> 0:9:32,25



205
0:9:32,25 --> 0:9:33,5
This thing is oil.


206
0:9:33,5 --> 0:9:37,87



207
0:9:37,87 --> 0:9:41,0
Then the oil is these
things are oil.


208
0:9:41,0 --> 0:9:42,49
Everything's got oil.


209
0:9:42,49 --> 0:9:44,2
Even your camera
inside got oil.


210
0:9:44,2 --> 0:9:46,46
EDDY MORETTI: It's like
the economic engine of


211
0:9:46,46 --> 0:9:47,52
Canada, this town.


212
0:9:47,52 --> 0:10:2,235
FRANK ROUTHIER:


213
0:10:2,235 --> 0:10:3,36
EDDY MORETTI: We're going to
leave the truck there.


214
0:10:3,36 --> 0:10:3,46
OK.


215
0:10:3,46 --> 0:10:4,18
We're going to go straight.


216
0:10:4,18 --> 0:10:4,94
FRANK ROUTHIER: Yeah.


217
0:10:4,94 --> 0:10:6,17
EDDY MORETTI: OK.


218
0:10:6,17 --> 0:10:7,5
FRANK ROUTHIER: But I give you
a clipboard so you can write


219
0:10:7,5 --> 0:10:8,74
your comments and stuff.


220
0:10:8,74 --> 0:10:9,99
EDDY MORETTI: Good, good.


221
0:10:9,99 --> 0:10:13,74



222
0:10:13,74 --> 0:10:16,2
Great.


223
0:10:16,2 --> 0:10:18,6
We're going there.


224
0:10:18,6 --> 0:10:20,24
[INAUDIBLE] men working here on
the pipeline down there but


225
0:10:20,24 --> 0:10:21,935
[INAUDIBLE] sector 32.


226
0:10:21,935 --> 0:10:24,212
We want to go down
to sector G9.


227
0:10:24,212 --> 0:10:36,29



228
0:10:36,29 --> 0:10:36,38
MALE SPEAKER: So I'm sorry
I forgot your first name.


229
0:10:36,38 --> 0:10:36,67
EDDY MORETTI: Eddie.


230
0:10:36,67 --> 0:10:38,37
MALE SPEAKER: Eddie,
this is Jason.


231
0:10:38,37 --> 0:10:38,63
EDDY MORETTI: Hey.


232
0:10:38,63 --> 0:10:38,68
JASON: How's it going?


233
0:10:38,68 --> 0:10:38,836
EDDY MORETTI: Hey.


234
0:10:38,836 --> 0:10:39,86
How's it going buddy?


235
0:10:39,86 --> 0:10:40,75
JASON: Not bad.


236
0:10:40,75 --> 0:10:41,19
Not bad.


237
0:10:41,19 --> 0:10:41,47
JC: JC.


238
0:10:41,47 --> 0:10:45,2
They call me JC up
around here.


239
0:10:45,2 --> 0:10:47,746
I don't like being called after
a toilet because it's


240
0:10:47,746 --> 0:10:49,2
what they call a
toilet, a john.


241
0:10:49,2 --> 0:10:50,5
Right?


242
0:10:50,5 --> 0:10:52,2
JC.


243
0:10:52,2 --> 0:10:53,46
EDDY MORETTI: Oh wow.


244
0:10:53,46 --> 0:10:57,5
JC: I had a chainsaw kickback
and kind of buggered me up a


245
0:10:57,5 --> 0:10:59,685
little bit back a
few years ago.


246
0:10:59,685 --> 0:11:1,27
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah, well you're
lucky it didn't do


247
0:11:1,27 --> 0:11:2,31
anything worse.


248
0:11:2,31 --> 0:11:4,32
JC: I keep the sunglasses
down now.


249
0:11:4,32 --> 0:11:6,77
I hide that stuff because
the ladies don't


250
0:11:6,77 --> 0:11:7,88
like to see that stuff.


251
0:11:7,88 --> 0:11:9,69
EDDY MORETTI: So you
like your job?


252
0:11:9,69 --> 0:11:10,58
JC: Oh I love it.


253
0:11:10,58 --> 0:11:11,79
EDDY MORETTI: You like trees?


254
0:11:11,79 --> 0:11:16,54
JC: I'm over here in fresh
air, nice blue skies.


255
0:11:16,54 --> 0:11:17,12
Life's great.


256
0:11:17,12 --> 0:11:17,81
Lots of wildlife.


257
0:11:17,81 --> 0:11:19,8
Well, I hadn't seen
anything yet but--


258
0:11:19,8 --> 0:11:23,81
MALE SPEAKER: You don't have
to touch anything.


259
0:11:23,81 --> 0:11:24,89
EDDY MORETTI: They're
nice trees.


260
0:11:24,89 --> 0:11:26,9
JC: Yeah exactly.


261
0:11:26,9 --> 0:11:30,35
I hate to cut them down if
they don't have to go.


262
0:11:30,35 --> 0:11:32,0
That's our oxygen, man.


263
0:11:32,0 --> 0:11:33,25
You know?


264
0:11:33,25 --> 0:11:39,22



265
0:11:39,22 --> 0:11:42,46
I hate to cut them out because
it's not that I'm a tree


266
0:11:42,46 --> 0:11:45,5
hugger but I'm not a
tree killer either.


267
0:11:45,5 --> 0:11:50,33



268
0:11:50,33 --> 0:11:50,827
EDDY MORETTI: Wow.


269
0:11:50,827 --> 0:11:53,809
He's really good.


270
0:11:53,809 --> 0:11:56,8
Oh shit!


271
0:11:56,8 --> 0:11:58,25
You did a good job buddy.


272
0:11:58,25 --> 0:12:0,42
You were really delicate
with that thing.


273
0:12:0,42 --> 0:12:4,36
You slowly steered it
into a direction.


274
0:12:4,36 --> 0:12:5,38
JC: Oh yeah.


275
0:12:5,38 --> 0:12:6,19
Yeah it's great fun.


276
0:12:6,19 --> 0:12:8,8
EDDY MORETTI: You like
Fort McMurray?


277
0:12:8,8 --> 0:12:8,355
JC: No.


278
0:12:8,355 --> 0:12:9,935
EDDY MORETTI: Why?


279
0:12:9,935 --> 0:12:13,18
JC: There's too many people in
too big of a rush up here.


280
0:12:13,18 --> 0:12:14,1
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


281
0:12:14,1 --> 0:12:15,45
JC: Too many I don't know.


282
0:12:15,45 --> 0:12:17,89
Like this highway, they
call it death highway.


283
0:12:17,89 --> 0:12:20,34
It's scares you to
drive on it.


284
0:12:20,34 --> 0:12:22,88
You don't know if somebody's
going to clean you or wipe you


285
0:12:22,88 --> 0:12:27,6
out or what so you keep close
to the ditch, right?


286
0:12:27,6 --> 0:12:28,14
EDDY MORETTI: What happens
to people?


287
0:12:28,14 --> 0:12:30,92
They just like, do they work
too hard and then party too


288
0:12:30,92 --> 0:12:32,89
hard and then the combination
gets them


289
0:12:32,89 --> 0:12:34,16
into trouble or what?


290
0:12:34,16 --> 0:12:34,96
JC: Oh, could be.


291
0:12:34,96 --> 0:12:35,63
It could be.


292
0:12:35,63 --> 0:12:38,36
There's a lot of people
that do long shifts.


293
0:12:38,36 --> 0:12:42,75
Us, we usually take our days
off after 21 or less.


294
0:12:42,75 --> 0:12:44,44
EDDY MORETTI: You work
21 days straight?


295
0:12:44,44 --> 0:12:46,0
JC: 21 days straight, yep.


296
0:12:46,0 --> 0:12:50,81
Then take five, six days off
to enjoy life a little bit.


297
0:12:50,81 --> 0:12:54,65
Some of these other guys, well
they get going 30, 40, 50 days


298
0:12:54,65 --> 0:12:55,66
straight and then--


299
0:12:55,66 --> 0:12:57,15
EDDY MORETTI: That's got
to be-- that's just not


300
0:12:57,15 --> 0:12:57,32
JC: Yeah, they get--


301
0:12:57,32 --> 0:12:57,96
EDDY MORETTI: Healthy.


302
0:12:57,96 --> 0:12:58,35
JC: No.


303
0:12:58,35 --> 0:13:1,25
They get burned out and
they get tired.


304
0:13:1,25 --> 0:13:6,61
It 's a way of life but it's
interesting at times.


305
0:13:6,61 --> 0:13:9,95
Wouldn't do anything else
otherwise, if I had a choice.


306
0:13:9,95 --> 0:13:10,58
Right?


307
0:13:10,58 --> 0:13:12,47
EDDY MORETTI: What's your plan
then, stay here for another


308
0:13:12,47 --> 0:13:15,17
couple years?


309
0:13:15,17 --> 0:13:15,26
JC: Yeah.


310
0:13:15,26 --> 0:13:17,37
I float the oil patch
through anyway.


311
0:13:17,37 --> 0:13:18,33
EDDY MORETTI: What does
that mean, float


312
0:13:18,33 --> 0:13:19,46
the oil patch through?


313
0:13:19,46 --> 0:13:22,29
JC: Well, as long as there's
money here, a man will be here


314
0:13:22,29 --> 0:13:25,58
working if he can fill his bank
account up, and put the


315
0:13:25,58 --> 0:13:28,87
bread and butter on the table
and this is where he'll be.


316
0:13:28,87 --> 0:13:33,93
If it ain't here, if it's in
BC or if it's in Sweden, if


317
0:13:33,93 --> 0:13:35,85
that's where the money is,
that's where we'll


318
0:13:35,85 --> 0:13:37,14
all have to go, right?


319
0:13:37,14 --> 0:13:37,57
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


320
0:13:37,57 --> 0:13:39,13
You have a family?


321
0:13:39,13 --> 0:13:39,5
JC: Yeah.


322
0:13:39,5 --> 0:13:41,91
I got a son.


323
0:13:41,91 --> 0:13:43,3
EDDY MORETTI: Here in Alberta?


324
0:13:43,3 --> 0:13:44,2
JC: In the Maritimes.


325
0:13:44,2 --> 0:13:44,65
EDDY MORETTI: In the Maritimes.


326
0:13:44,65 --> 0:13:46,542
JC: Yeah.


327
0:13:46,542 --> 0:13:48,33
EDDY MORETTI: So you're
not going back home.


328
0:13:48,33 --> 0:13:49,4
You're here for good.


329
0:13:49,4 --> 0:13:51,8
JC: If I'm here, I'm here
for the-- as long


330
0:13:51,8 --> 0:13:51,84
as the money's here.


331
0:13:51,84 --> 0:13:53,82
EDDY MORETTI: As long as the
oil's flowing you're--


332
0:13:53,82 --> 0:13:54,52
JC: Yeah.


333
0:13:54,52 --> 0:13:55,92
Exactly.


334
0:13:55,92 --> 0:13:57,865
The welfare line's not for me.


335
0:13:57,865 --> 0:14:0,53
EDDY MORETTI: Right on.


336
0:14:0,53 --> 0:14:2,37
SIMON DYER: George Bush's State
of the Union Address a


337
0:14:2,37 --> 0:14:3,1
couple of years ago--


338
0:14:3,1 --> 0:14:3,45
EDDY MORETTI: Last year.


339
0:14:3,45 --> 0:14:5,1
Right.


340
0:14:5,1 --> 0:14:8,9
SIMON DYER: Pretty bluntly said
we're addicted to foreign


341
0:14:8,9 --> 0:14:9,6
oil and we need to get
off foreign oil.


342
0:14:9,6 --> 0:14:10,65
And he didn't consider--


343
0:14:10,65 --> 0:14:12,79
I don't think he considers
Canada foreign in that


344
0:14:12,79 --> 0:14:15,33
respective.


345
0:14:15,33 --> 0:14:16,81
MALE SPEAKER: Ladies and
gentlemen, thank you for


346
0:14:16,81 --> 0:14:18,18
coming this afternoon.


347
0:14:18,18 --> 0:14:22,13
And first and foremost, I want
to welcome back to Fort


348
0:14:22,13 --> 0:14:24,94
McMurray our premier
Ed Stelmach.


349
0:14:24,94 --> 0:14:28,6
Premier, welcome back
to Fort McMurray.


350
0:14:28,6 --> 0:14:31,2
ED STELMACH: Over the past year,
I've spoken to a lot of


351
0:14:31,2 --> 0:14:33,38
ordinary Albertans.


352
0:14:33,38 --> 0:14:36,6
They are proud of Alberta's
position in Canada as an


353
0:14:36,6 --> 0:14:38,33
economic powerhouse.


354
0:14:38,33 --> 0:14:41,92
However, there is always a word
of caution and that is


355
0:14:41,92 --> 0:14:44,15
Ed, don't blow it.


356
0:14:44,15 --> 0:14:46,55
EDDY MORETTI: This is the new
premier, Ed Stelmach.


357
0:14:46,55 --> 0:14:49,48
He took over from this
guy, Ralph Klein.


358
0:14:49,48 --> 0:14:52,56
And he's the guy responsible
for kick-starting the oil


359
0:14:52,56 --> 0:14:54,65
sands in the '90s.


360
0:14:54,65 --> 0:14:58,39
While you were premier,
were you pressured by


361
0:14:58,39 --> 0:14:58,773
multinationals


362
0:14:58,773 --> 0:14:59,156
RALPH KLEIN: No.


363
0:14:59,156 --> 0:15:0,32
EDDY MORETTI: To increase
production?


364
0:15:0,32 --> 0:15:0,57
RALPH KLEIN: No.


365
0:15:0,57 --> 0:15:2,55
Never.


366
0:15:2,55 --> 0:15:7,15
10 years ago, I took a
delegation down to Houston and


367
0:15:7,15 --> 0:15:12,84
I can recall holding a symposium
to talk about the


368
0:15:12,84 --> 0:15:20,82
oil sands, and how Canada can
meet the reliable and secure


369
0:15:20,82 --> 0:15:22,5
supply that the


370
0:15:22,5 --> 0:15:22,52
EDDY MORETTI: Stable.


371
0:15:22,52 --> 0:15:23,12
RALPH KLEIN: US is
looking for.


372
0:15:23,12 --> 0:15:24,47
The stable supply.


373
0:15:24,47 --> 0:15:29,65
First of all, we stationed a
person in Washington, DC to


374
0:15:29,65 --> 0:15:34,25
focus really on the American
legislators, those in Congress


375
0:15:34,25 --> 0:15:36,24
and in Senate--


376
0:15:36,24 --> 0:15:39,12
EDDY MORETTI: And is working,
his work is having results?


377
0:15:39,12 --> 0:15:40,3
RALPH KLEIN: His work is--


378
0:15:40,3 --> 0:15:42,683
well, his work has been
highly successful.


379
0:15:42,683 --> 0:15:45,67



380
0:15:45,67 --> 0:15:49,31
LINDSAY TELFER: We've created
the most accessible investment


381
0:15:49,31 --> 0:15:50,81
climate for oil companies.


382
0:15:50,81 --> 0:15:51,54
EDDY MORETTI: Why?


383
0:15:51,54 --> 0:15:54,1
LINDSAY TELFER: Heck, because
we wanted the investment.


384
0:15:54,1 --> 0:15:55,42
We wanted people to come in.


385
0:15:55,42 --> 0:15:58,4
So in the '90s we set up a
royalty regime that allowed


386
0:15:58,4 --> 0:16:0,56
them to virtually not
pay royalties.


387
0:16:0,56 --> 0:16:4,31
A majority of the oil sands,
once it's upgraded and refined


388
0:16:4,31 --> 0:16:6,7
and often before it's upgraded
and refined, is


389
0:16:6,7 --> 0:16:8,4
shipped to the States.


390
0:16:8,4 --> 0:16:13,98
The Chicago area is one
of the sent hubs


391
0:16:13,98 --> 0:16:17,17
for the bitumen upgrading.


392
0:16:17,17 --> 0:16:22,67
EDDY MORETTI: This pipe
goes all the way to


393
0:16:22,67 --> 0:16:27,47
Chicago, which is far.


394
0:16:27,47 --> 0:16:29,99
We're good for 50 years,
America, and


395
0:16:29,99 --> 0:16:31,42
after that you're fucked.


396
0:16:31,42 --> 0:16:33,73
You're on your own.


397
0:16:33,73 --> 0:16:35,84
SIMON DYER: The tar sands is
producing about a million


398
0:16:35,84 --> 0:16:37,36
barrels of oil a day.


399
0:16:37,36 --> 0:16:40,65
And there are discussions to
increase that to 5 million


400
0:16:40,65 --> 0:16:42,36
barrels a day.


401
0:16:42,36 --> 0:16:44,51
America, of course, uses
more than 20 million


402
0:16:44,51 --> 0:16:45,65
barrels of oil a day.


403
0:16:45,65 --> 0:16:49,18
So I mean the tar sands can plug
that gap for only a very


404
0:16:49,18 --> 0:16:51,45
short period and it's never
going to be able to meet


405
0:16:51,45 --> 0:16:54,54
Americans' needs so we need to
look at other solutions.


406
0:16:54,54 --> 0:16:56,7
LINDSAY TELFER: When you're in
government, there's a lot of


407
0:16:56,7 --> 0:17:0,29
pressure to be open and
friendly to industrial


408
0:17:0,29 --> 0:17:5,16
development and Klein was the
best of the best of them.


409
0:17:5,16 --> 0:17:7,44
And what we're seeing now is
some of those leaders going


410
0:17:7,44 --> 0:17:9,8
whoa, maybe we did this
a little bit too fast.


411
0:17:9,8 --> 0:17:10,4
OK.


412
0:17:10,4 --> 0:17:11,88
Well obviously there's
been no plan.


413
0:17:11,88 --> 0:17:13,579
That's why it spiraled
out of control.


414
0:17:13,579 --> 0:17:15,53
Our communities have spiraled
out of control.


415
0:17:15,53 --> 0:17:17,339
Development has spiraled
out of control.


416
0:17:17,339 --> 0:17:20,17
Klein came out after he left
office saying, no, we didn't


417
0:17:20,17 --> 0:17:20,7
have a plan.


418
0:17:20,7 --> 0:17:23,2
We just said come on in.


419
0:17:23,2 --> 0:17:25,65
EDDY MORETTI: People have said
that you have said that you


420
0:17:25,65 --> 0:17:28,62
didn't have a plan for the
development of the oil sands.


421
0:17:28,62 --> 0:17:29,85
RALPH KLEIN: No.


422
0:17:29,85 --> 0:17:29,55
EDDY MORETTI: Is that true?


423
0:17:29,55 --> 0:17:30,48
Or is that misquoting you?


424
0:17:30,48 --> 0:17:31,75
RALPH KLEIN: No.


425
0:17:31,75 --> 0:17:35,32
We had a plan for sustainable
growth.


426
0:17:35,32 --> 0:17:43,76
We had a plan for $50 a barrel
oil and gas at $6.50 a


427
0:17:43,76 --> 0:17:46,79
gigajoule, but we didn't
have a plan for


428
0:17:46,79 --> 0:17:48,2
unprecedented growth.


429
0:17:48,2 --> 0:17:49,22
No one has a plan.


430
0:17:49,22 --> 0:17:52,24
Not even the current premier or
the current cabinet has a


431
0:17:52,24 --> 0:17:57,21
plan for unprecedented growth,
nor does Al Gore have a plan,


432
0:17:57,21 --> 0:17:57,84
by the way.


433
0:17:57,84 --> 0:17:58,61
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


434
0:17:58,61 --> 0:18:0,495
RALPH KLEIN: And you're asking
for a personal opinion--


435
0:18:0,495 --> 0:18:0,75
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


436
0:18:0,75 --> 0:18:3,27
RALPH KLEIN: And I can offer a
personal opinion, and I say


437
0:18:3,27 --> 0:18:4,52
let the markets prevail.


438
0:18:4,52 --> 0:20:4,52
