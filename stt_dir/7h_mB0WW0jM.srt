1
0:0:8,7 --> 0:0:18,33
Far out in space, in the center of a seething
cosmic maelstrom.


2
0:0:18,33 --> 0:0:26,11
Extreme heat. High velocities.


3
0:0:26,11 --> 0:0:39,469
Atoms tear, and space literally buckles.


4
0:0:39,469 --> 0:0:50,92
Photons fly out across the universe, energized
to the limits found in nature.


5
0:0:50,92 --> 0:1:1,55
Billions of years later, they enter the detectors
of spacecraft stationed above our atmosphere.


6
0:1:1,55 --> 0:1:10,35
Our ability to record them is part of a new
age of high-energy astronomy, and a new age


7
0:1:10,35 --> 0:1:15,17
of insights into nature at its most extreme.


8
0:1:15,17 --> 0:1:47,959
What can we learn by witnessing the violent
birth of a black hole?


9
0:1:47,959 --> 0:1:53,74
There have been times when our understanding
of the universe has reached a standstill,


10
0:1:53,74 --> 0:2:0,639
when our grasp of the workings of time and
space, the nature of matter and energy, do


11
0:2:0,639 --> 0:2:6,569
not fully square with what we observe.


12
0:2:6,569 --> 0:2:14,76
In those times, opposing world views cannot
be resolved.


13
0:2:14,76 --> 0:2:25,489
So it was in the spring of 1920, when astronomers
debated the scale of the universe.


14
0:2:25,489 --> 0:2:32,49
The scene was the National Academy of Sciences
in Washington, DC.


15
0:2:32,49 --> 0:2:37,959
On one side was the astronomer Harlow Shapley,
known for his groundbreaking work on the size


16
0:2:37,959 --> 0:2:44,53
of our galaxy and the position of the sun
within it.


17
0:2:44,53 --> 0:2:51,269
Shapley described the galaxy as an island
universe. As large as his measurements suggested


18
0:2:51,269 --> 0:2:57,39
it was, it might indeed be all there is.


19
0:2:57,39 --> 0:3:4,69
That included mysterious fuzzy shapes known
as spiral nebulae. He argued they were merely


20
0:3:4,69 --> 0:3:8,79
gas clouds.


21
0:3:8,79 --> 0:3:15,849
On the opposing side, Heber Curtis argued
that some nebulae were also island universes.


22
0:3:15,849 --> 0:3:18,37
That idea was not new.


23
0:3:18,37 --> 0:3:26,18
165 years earlier, the German philosopher
Emmanuel Kant described the nebulae as galaxies


24
0:3:26,18 --> 0:3:27,37
unto themselves.


25
0:3:27,37 --> 0:3:34,53
“It is noted only in the Milky Way,” he
said,” that whitish clouds are seen; several


26
0:3:34,53 --> 0:3:40,42
patches of similar aspect shine with faint
light here and there throughout the aether,


27
0:3:40,42 --> 0:3:46,17
and if the telescope is turned upon any of
these it confronts us with a tight mass of


28
0:3:46,17 --> 0:3:49,4
stars.”


29
0:3:49,4 --> 0:3:54,65
It took a new generation of powerful telescopes
for astronomers to finally measure the distance


30
0:3:54,65 --> 0:3:59,89
to those mysterious objects.


31
0:3:59,89 --> 0:4:5,43
Within a few years after the Great Debate,
Edwin Hubble reported data showing the spiral


32
0:4:5,43 --> 0:4:12,84
nebulae lay far beyond the Milky Way. That
led to our current understanding of a universe


33
0:4:12,84 --> 0:4:22,4
billions of light years across, filled with
galaxies, and expanding rapidly.


34
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:28,73
In the years since, essential details about
this dynamic universe have stubbornly resisted


35
0:4:28,73 --> 0:4:37,35
our inquiries. The deeper we dug into the
nature of matter and energy, the more obscure


36
0:4:37,35 --> 0:4:41,7
they seemed to become.


37
0:4:41,7 --> 0:4:52,15
One of the deepest mysteries of all emerged
in the 1960s.


38
0:4:52,15 --> 0:5:0,82
That was a time when nations were rapidly
expanding and testing their nuclear arsenals.


39
0:5:0,82 --> 0:5:7,61
In 1963, the United States, Soviet Union,
and the United Kingdom signed the Limited


40
0:5:7,61 --> 0:5:15,92
Test Ban Treaty, which prohibited above-ground
nuclear testing.


41
0:5:15,92 --> 0:5:22,91
To verify compliance, the United States launched
six pairs of satellites known as Vela, from


42
0:5:22,91 --> 0:5:31,7
the Spanish verb to watch over or keep vigil.
They were designed to record a distinctive


43
0:5:31,7 --> 0:5:39,88
signal of nuclear explosions, called gamma
rays.


44
0:5:39,88 --> 0:5:45,52
Gamma rays are an ultra high-energy form of
electromagnetic radiation, a term used to


45
0:5:45,52 --> 0:5:55,9
describe particles called photons that travel
out from an energy source.


46
0:5:55,9 --> 0:6:4,87
The lowest-energy form, radio, has a wavelength
of up to 300 meters. Though we can’t see


47
0:6:4,87 --> 0:6:14,44
them, they are produced naturally, for example,
in flashes of lightning.


48
0:6:14,44 --> 0:6:20,48
Our eyes are tuned to capture much smaller
visible wavelengths down to 400 nanometers,


49
0:6:20,48 --> 0:6:26,1
or 400 billionths of a meter.


50
0:6:26,1 --> 0:6:34,55
Carrying even more energy, ultraviolet light
has a wavelength as short as 10 nanometers.


51
0:6:34,55 --> 0:6:41,33
X-Rays, which penetrate soft tissue in our
bodies, can be as short as one hundredth of


52
0:6:41,33 --> 0:6:46,73
a nanometer.


53
0:6:46,73 --> 0:6:52,71
Gamma rays carry so much energy that their
wavelength can be less than 10 picometers.


54
0:6:52,71 --> 0:6:59,63
That’s below the diameter of an atom.


55
0:6:59,63 --> 0:7:6,91
They are known as “ionizing radiation,”
which means heavy exposure can strip electrons


56
0:7:6,91 --> 0:7:22,83
from atoms in your body and kill you. Fortunately,
gamma rays from space do not penetrate our


57
0:7:22,83 --> 0:7:25,19
atmosphere.


58
0:7:25,19 --> 0:7:32,39
Still, one theory says that a nearby gamma
ray burst might have been responsible for


59
0:7:32,39 --> 0:7:39,63
a mass extinction 440 million years ago, by
destroying Earth’s ozone layer and allowing


60
0:7:39,63 --> 0:7:49,25
in a flood of deadly ultraviolet radiation.


61
0:7:49,25 --> 0:7:54,74
Unlike lower-energy forms of electromagnetic
radiation, gamma rays are produced by the


62
0:7:54,74 --> 0:8:4,74
often violent decay of atomic nuclei in nuclear
reactions.


63
0:8:4,74 --> 0:8:13,54
On the hunt for clandestine nuclear tests,
on July 2, 1967, the Vela 3 and Vela 4 satellites


64
0:8:13,54 --> 0:8:22,55
detected a flash of gamma radiation that was
unlike a nuclear weapon.


65
0:8:22,55 --> 0:8:28,63
As additional Vela satellites were launched,
a team at Los Alamos National Lab continued


66
0:8:28,63 --> 0:8:35,56
to find these mysterious bursts in their data.
They were able to narrow the sky positions


67
0:8:35,56 --> 0:8:44,13
of sixteen, and to rule out a terrestrial
or solar origin.


68
0:8:44,13 --> 0:8:57,23
It would take at least 30 years to figure
out what they were.


69
0:8:57,23 --> 0:9:8,38
A year after the launch of the Hubble Space
Telescope in 1990, the 17-ton Compton Gamma


70
0:9:8,38 --> 0:9:17,99
Ray Observatory was sent up, in part, to produce
a comprehensive map of gamma ray bursts.


71
0:9:17,99 --> 0:9:24,79
Over a thousand detections showed the bursts
were randomly spread across the sky. That


72
0:9:24,79 --> 0:9:31,81
led to another great debate, held in 1995,
to stimulate fresh thinking on this long running


73
0:9:31,81 --> 0:9:35,2
mystery.


74
0:9:35,2 --> 0:9:40,81
Donald Lamb of the University of Chicago argued
that they came from a recently discovered


75
0:9:40,81 --> 0:9:51,34
crop of neutron stars that had escaped into
the halo of our galaxy.


76
0:9:51,34 --> 0:9:56,7
Bohdan Paczynski of Princeton University argued
that their locations followed the general


77
0:9:56,7 --> 0:10:2,21
layout of galaxies and quasars.


78
0:10:2,21 --> 0:10:7,23
But at those distances, he conceded, the bursts
would have to be the most luminous objects


79
0:10:7,23 --> 0:10:11,88
known in the universe.


80
0:10:11,88 --> 0:10:17,9
And yet a third of them disappear in less
than two seconds. The rest die out within


81
0:10:17,9 --> 0:10:18,56
minutes.


82
0:10:18,56 --> 0:10:26,46
Were they stars flaring up within our cosmic
neighborhood? Or were they something far more


83
0:10:26,46 --> 0:10:37,92
violent – and more fundamental to the workings
of time and space?


84
0:10:37,92 --> 0:10:44,81
In the years that followed, a revolution would
sweep the field of high-energy astronomy.


85
0:10:44,81 --> 0:10:52,34
The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched
in 1997.


86
0:10:52,34 --> 0:11:4,48
It was followed by the gamma ray satellites
Integral in 2002, and HETE-2 in 2003.


87
0:11:4,48 --> 0:11:11,2
The ultimate gamma ray hunter, Swift, was
sent into orbit in 2004.


88
0:11:11,2 --> 0:11:17,48
With ultra-violet, x-ray, and gamma ray sensors,
Swift’s goal was to pinpoint as many as


89
0:11:17,48 --> 0:11:28,37
100 gamma ray bursts per year, and to relay
their locations down to earth within seconds.


90
0:11:28,37 --> 0:11:33,31
That would allow astronomers on the ground
to quickly aim their telescopes at the source


91
0:11:33,31 --> 0:11:40,22
to capture the afterglow. That would allow
them to measure its distance and to find clues


92
0:11:40,22 --> 0:11:47,34
to what caused it in the first place.


93
0:11:47,34 --> 0:11:57,34
Those clues began to appear in early 1997.
An Italian satellite called Beppo Sax detected


94
0:11:57,34 --> 0:12:2,87
a burst and relayed its location to Earth.


95
0:12:2,87 --> 0:12:8,74
The Hubble Space Telescope captured this image
of the fading afterglow, suggesting that it


96
0:12:8,74 --> 0:12:15,23
came from another galaxy beyond our own.


97
0:12:15,23 --> 0:12:20,87
Astronomers analyzed light captured by ground
telescopes and found hints that it was associated


98
0:12:20,87 --> 0:12:25,68
with a supernova.


99
0:12:25,68 --> 0:12:31,0
The association with supernovae became stronger
over time.


100
0:12:31,0 --> 0:12:36,779
A 1998 burst coincided with this supernova.


101
0:12:36,779 --> 0:12:46,94
A 2003 burst with this supernova.


102
0:12:46,94 --> 0:12:54,37
And a 2006 burst with this supernova.


103
0:12:54,37 --> 0:13:1,76
But these were no ordinary explosions. Scientists
were struck by the amount of energy released,


104
0:13:1,76 --> 0:13:6,81
and by their extreme brightness.


105
0:13:6,81 --> 0:13:14,42
On March 19, 2008, astronomers recorded a
burst that originated 7.5 billion light years


106
0:13:14,42 --> 0:13:27,1
away. And yet its afterglow was bright enough
to be seen with the naked eye from Earth.


107
0:13:27,1 --> 0:13:33,2
That confirmed a long running suspicion: that
the source was a narrow and extremely powerful


108
0:13:33,2 --> 0:13:40,93
beam of light. What astronomers saw was actually
the impact of this beam as it passed through


109
0:13:40,93 --> 0:13:47,21
clouds of gas, heating them up to billions
of degrees, and generating ultra high-energy


110
0:13:47,21 --> 0:13:51,38
gamma rays.


111
0:13:51,38 --> 0:13:57,21
Phenomena like this are not uncommon in our
universe. You can find beams and high speed


112
0:13:57,21 --> 0:14:6,839
jets wherever matter falls rapidly into stars,
galaxies, or black holes.


113
0:14:6,839 --> 0:14:20,61
Few of these are known to marshal as much
power as a gamma ray burst.


114
0:14:20,61 --> 0:14:29,69
September 13, 2008. The Swift satellite recorded
a burst with the power of 9000 supernovae,


115
0:14:29,69 --> 0:14:38,67
and a jet that was clocked at 99.9999% the
speed of light.


116
0:14:38,67 --> 0:14:51,88
April 29, 2009 brought the second most distant
object ever recorded. The journey of this


117
0:14:51,88 --> 0:15:1,51
Gamma Ray burst started 13.14 billion years
ago.


118
0:15:1,51 --> 0:15:7,18
Astronomers have begun to see these beacons
as probes for understanding the chemical evolution


119
0:15:7,18 --> 0:15:13,75
of the cosmos, going all the way back to when
stars and galaxies were just beginning to


120
0:15:13,75 --> 0:15:19,36
form.


121
0:15:19,36 --> 0:15:24,899
But how does nature produce a beacon of light
that can reach across the entire breadth of


122
0:15:24,899 --> 0:15:29,46
the visible universe?


123
0:15:29,46 --> 0:15:35,399
One team of scientists has been looking for
answers close to home, in a giant galaxy some


124
0:15:35,399 --> 0:15:43,39
50 million light years away, known as M87.


125
0:15:43,39 --> 0:15:49,839
The Event Horizon Telescope links telescopes
thousands of kilometers apart into a single


126
0:15:49,839 --> 0:15:58,69
giant instrument. The astronomers targeted
sub-millimeter radio waves because they have


127
0:15:58,69 --> 0:16:7,29
just the right frequency to move through dust
and gas in the core of M87.


128
0:16:7,29 --> 0:16:15,13
That galaxy has one of the largest black holes
known, at 6.6 billion solar masses.


129
0:16:15,13 --> 0:16:22,11
The resolution of this system was enough to
collect data on a region just outside the


130
0:16:22,11 --> 0:16:27,62
event horizon of the black hole, the point
beyond which nothing can escape its gravitational


131
0:16:27,62 --> 0:16:31,26
pull.


132
0:16:31,26 --> 0:16:37,67
The scientists were able to see down to the
base of a spectacular jet that blasts continuously


133
0:16:37,67 --> 0:16:42,92
out of M87’s core.


134
0:16:42,92 --> 0:16:49,24
This region is held under the spell of extreme
gravity.


135
0:16:49,24 --> 0:16:55,54
Subject to what Albert Einstein called frame
dragging, space and time are pulled along


136
0:16:55,54 --> 0:17:1,62
on a path that leads into the black hole.


137
0:17:1,62 --> 0:17:8,699
As gas, dust, stars or planets fall into the
hole, they form into a disk that spirals in


138
0:17:8,699 --> 0:17:12,51
with the flow of space time, reaching the
speed of light just as it hits the event horizon.


139
0:17:12,51 --> 0:17:17,239
The spinning motion of this so-called “accretion
disk” can channel some of the inflowing


140
0:17:17,239 --> 0:17:28,84
matter out into a pair of high-energy beams,
or jets.


141
0:17:28,84 --> 0:17:37,409
How a jet can form was shown in a supercomputer
simulation of a short gamma ray burst.


142
0:17:37,409 --> 0:17:42,73
It was based on a 40-millisecond long burst
recorded by Swift on May 9, 2005. It took


143
0:17:42,73 --> 0:17:45,98
five minutes for the afterglow to fade, but
that was enough for astronomers to capture


144
0:17:45,98 --> 0:17:47,279
crucial details.


145
0:17:47,279 --> 0:17:58,639
It had come from a giant galaxy 2.6 billion
light years away, filled with old stars.


146
0:17:58,639 --> 0:18:4,49
Scientists suspected that this was a case
of two dead stars falling into a catastrophic


147
0:18:4,49 --> 0:18:6,61
embrace.


148
0:18:6,61 --> 0:18:13,419
Orbiting each other, they moved ever closer,
gradually gaining speed.


149
0:18:13,419 --> 0:18:22,269
At the end of the line, they began tearing
each other apart, until they finally merged.


150
0:18:22,269 --> 0:18:33,909
NASA scientists simulated the final 35 thousandths
of a second, when a black hole forms.


151
0:18:33,909 --> 0:18:40,139
As the two objects move together, their mass
is scrambled into a dense, hot cloud of swirling


152
0:18:40,139 --> 0:18:43,72
debris, shown on the left side of the image.


153
0:18:43,72 --> 0:18:50,69
On the right, are magnetic fields that spin
up off this cloud. Blue represents magnetic


154
0:18:50,69 --> 0:18:58,47
strength a billion times greater than that
of the Sun.


155
0:18:58,47 --> 0:19:4,929
These fields begin to channel a cloud of plasma
that surrounds the newly formed black hole.


156
0:19:4,929 --> 0:19:12,34
Chaos reigns. But the new structure becomes
steadily more organized, and the magnetic


157
0:19:12,34 --> 0:19:20,95
field takes on the character of a jet.


158
0:19:20,95 --> 0:19:26,239
Within less than a second after the black
hole is born, it launches a jet of particles


159
0:19:26,239 --> 0:19:31,489
to a speed approaching light.


160
0:19:31,489 --> 0:19:41,289
A similar chain of events, in the death of
a large star, is responsible for longer gamma


161
0:19:41,289 --> 0:19:43,7
ray bursts.


162
0:19:43,7 --> 0:19:51,34
Stars resist gravity by generating photons
that push outward on their enormous mass.


163
0:19:51,34 --> 0:19:57,35
But the weight of a large star’s core increases
from the accumulation of heavy elements produced


164
0:19:57,35 --> 0:20:9,799
in nuclear fusion. In time, its outer layers
cannot resist the inward pull… and the star


165
0:20:9,799 --> 0:20:14,59
collapses.


166
0:20:14,59 --> 0:20:29,519
The crash produces a shock wave that races
through the star… and obliterates it.


167
0:20:29,519 --> 0:20:36,279
In the largest of these dying stars, known
as collapsars or hypernovae, a black hole


168
0:20:36,279 --> 0:20:41,179
forms in the collapse.


169
0:20:41,179 --> 0:20:47,94
Matter flowing in forms a disk. Charged particles
create magnetic fields that twist off this


170
0:20:47,94 --> 0:21:10,559
disk, sending a portion out in high-speed
jets.


171
0:21:10,559 --> 0:21:21,2
Simulations show that the jet is powerful
enough to plow its way through the star. In


172
0:21:21,2 --> 0:21:36,359
so doing, it may help trigger the explosion.


173
0:21:36,359 --> 0:21:45,169
The birth of a black hole does not simply
light up the universe.


174
0:21:45,169 --> 0:21:50,629
It is a crucial event in the spread of heavy
elements that seed the birth of new solar


175
0:21:50,629 --> 0:21:57,7
systems and planets.


176
0:21:57,7 --> 0:22:6,919
But the black hole birth cries that we can
now register with a fleet of high-energy telescopes


177
0:22:6,919 --> 0:22:14,509
are part of wider response to gravity’s
convulsive power.


178
0:22:14,509 --> 0:22:22,159
Take the gamma ray burst recorded by the Swift
satellite in late March 2011.


179
0:22:22,159 --> 0:22:28,45
It came from a normally quiescent galaxy in
the Constellation Draco, 3.8 billion light


180
0:22:28,45 --> 0:22:34,179
years away.


181
0:22:34,179 --> 0:22:40,649
Most Gamma ray bursts fade within seconds
or minutes. This one lasted four and a half


182
0:22:40,649 --> 0:22:45,419
hours.


183
0:22:45,419 --> 0:22:50,269
Scientists concluded that it could not have
come from a supernova.


184
0:22:50,269 --> 0:22:56,389
They proposed instead that a large star had
probably been thrown off track during an encounter


185
0:22:56,389 --> 0:23:3,419
with another star. It moved too close to a
supermassive black hole in the center of the


186
0:23:3,419 --> 0:23:7,499
galaxy.


187
0:23:7,499 --> 0:23:16,32
This animation shows what happened. The black
hole tore the star apart, and launched a jet


188
0:23:16,32 --> 0:23:24,799
from matter that swirled in.


189
0:23:24,799 --> 0:23:32,499
The jet happened to be pointed right at Earth.


190
0:23:32,499 --> 0:23:38,799
We can be grateful this blast was so far away,
and that we are not in the firing line of


191
0:23:38,799 --> 0:23:46,97
a supermassive black hole that lies in the
center of our own galaxy.


192
0:23:46,97 --> 0:23:56,429
Astronomers have observed giant stars whipped
to high speeds by this monster.


193
0:23:56,429 --> 0:24:3,309
Should one of these stars be thrown off its
path, it could become prey.


194
0:24:3,309 --> 0:24:11,549
The monster will surely let distant observers
know of its conquest, with a blinding flash


195
0:24:11,549 --> 0:26:11,549
that’s visible across the universe.
