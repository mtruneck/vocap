###10 >> I remember the day that everything I understood about soils began to change.
###13 It was the day I met Ray Archuleta.
###17 I wanted to talk to him about no-till equipment, but he pointed me in a different direction.
###23 >> It is not about the equipment.
###27 It's about the understanding.
###28 The most important thing about it is understanding how your soil system functions.
###33 That's number one.
###35 >> Now the soil functions that farmers care about are the supply
###39 of water and nutrients to their crop.
###42 Soil ecologists tell us that 90% of these functions are dependent on soil biology.
###48 >> There's this movement through the country where people are realizing, "You know what?
###51 If we farm nature's way, we start saving on inputs."
###56 Does nature disrupt itself?
###57 It doesn't do that, and if you can learn the principles --
###61 I call them the keys to the soil health.
###63 It is limit disturbance; cover the soil all the time with diversity, diversity, diversity;
###70 have a live root growing all the time.
###73 That's what nature does.
###74 >> To be honest, the skeptic inside of me did not quite believe Ray.
###79 But he began to introduce me to veterans of this movement, real farmers like Ray Styer,
###85 Gabe and Paul Brown, and Dave Brandt, and they all seemed to be singing his song.
###91 >> It seems to be that the more species you have growing together,
###94 the diversity of your cover crop, the better it is.
###99 >> We have quite the diversity in our cropland.
###103 Twenty-five different species we've grown this year,
###106 both in cover crop combinations and for cash crops.
###110 >> Today at this farm, we have 20 different covers.
###114 We have them in five-way blends, seven-way blends, eight-way blends, and ten-way blends.
###119 >> It took me a while to realize that these farmers were imitating nature's way
###123 by using diverse cover crops, and by doing
###126 that they were meeting three of those four soil health keys.
###130 My "aha" moment happened in a corn stand in North Dakota.
###133 >> This side did not have compost, and it did not have tea.
###140 There is no commercial fertilizer on any of it.
###143 This side is running purely off the energy of last year's cover crop.
###147 These four corn fields are probably one of the best examples of the power
###154 of diversity that I can show you.
###157 The power of diversity is extremely strong.
###160 Now had we come out here last year and planted a monoculture out here,
###164 and tried to drive this corn off of a monoculture,
###167 I suspect this wouldn't look quite like it does.
###172 >> Oh, look at that.
###172 >> Now I could put you to sleep by talking about a recent paradigm shift in soil science
###178 that will change the face of agriculture, but I have a better idea.
###183 You see, I met three farmers who saw what I saw in North Dakota, and they acted on it.
###188 And that started a small revolution in their home county.
###192 This is the story of their rookie years in diverse cover crops.
###196 [ Music ]
###232 >> My name's Nathan Lowder, I'm the District Conservationist here in Stanly
###236 and Montgomery County, and I also have a farming interest in the county also
###241 where we have beef cows and row crop production.
###245 >> I'm Curtis Furr.
###245 I'm from Stanly County, North Carolina.
###248 >> John Pickler of Low Creek Farms.
###250 >> We grow corn.
###252 >> Soybeans.
###253 >> Cotton.
###254 >> My biggest crop is the cotton.
###255 I have somewheres in the 850-acre range of cotton.
###260 >> We raise a lot of corn for cutting purposes.
###264 >> Possibly this year we might grow some popcorn.
###267 It's been since the late '60 early '70's we've been no-tilling here.
###271 >> Actually, my farm is the complete no-till system.
###274 Don't use any type of incorporation.
###277 >> We've been no-tilling in the neighborhood of 35 years, and we like no-tilling.
###282 It saves us a lot of time.
###283 We can get over to ground faster.
###286 We feel that's the way to go.
###287 You know, we got to save every bit of moisture because we don't never know
###290 when the dry spell's going to hit us.
###292 And all our acres were dryland acres; no irrigation.
###295 [ Music ]
###311 >> My sense is that most farmers viewed cover crops as an erosion control measure.
###315 Nice, but expensive, and a hassle, and certainly not an asset.
###322 >> We used the cover crops behind low residue producing crops.
###326 A lot of time, wheat was used just because it was so readily available,
###330 a little bit of oats, some Triticale, some rye.
###335 >> We've been growing cover crops for several years now, off and on,
###339 but we weren't quite getting what we felt like we needed as far as the right kind
###344 of mix and the right kind of cover.
###347 It was either getting it all rye or too much -- too much of one thing.
###353 >> We always saw the opportunity that we could include something to these cover crops
###357 to help get us some additional nutrients for our next crop.
###362 But in years past, inputs were relatively cheap -- I'm not going to say cheap,
###367 but you could afford to buy them so that opportunity was never really sought out.
###375 >> But things began to change, especially around 2008.
###379 >> Well, it's a known fact, with fuel going to $4.00 to $5.00,
###384 we're seeing higher fertilizer cost, and any way that we could shave off some of the expense
###390 of some of the fertilizer, we're going to have to find those ways.
###393 >> This meant that these hard-nosed businessmen became more receptive to the new paradigm
###398 that views soils as ecosystems rather than black boxes or chemistry sets.
###404 >> I sat through Ray's meeting at the Ag Civic Center down here in Stanly County.
###410 >> Ah, now we're getting to it.
###412 Oh, my goodness; it's the soil biology.
###415 You mean those little arthropods, the bacteria, the fungus,
###420 all these critters make organic matter.
###424 Oh, by the way, you can't have the soil biology without the plants,
###429 and the plants need the microbes.
###431 Doesn't the soil look beautiful?
###433 Who would have thought the soil would look something like that?
###435 Our job, landowners, is to manage that habitat right here, that pore space, and keep it intact.
###443 >> My first impression of Ray, I thought, "Boy, this man's crazy."
###448 But the more I listened to him, I decided he'd probably forgot more than I'll ever know
###453 about cover crops, and then he asked me and John to go with him out to North Dakota.
###460 >> When I went to North Dakota, it was real eye opening
###462 because those guys are working with limited moisture.
###465 They're looking at 12 inches of actual rainfall throughout a year,
###469 and they were growing some good crops with that kind of moisture.
###473 And the only way you're going to be able to grow crops is conserve your moisture.
###477 Why wouldn't it work when we're in an area that's --
###480 in a normal year we have 40 inches of rain?
###483 But my deal is I want to drought-proof the ground as good as I can.
###490 >> With the expense I've already had with cover crops, and going out there
###494 and seeing what they have done, just, you know, I thought, "There ain't no excuse
###499 that we can't use this in North Carolina."
###501 >> As far as Curtis and John were concerned, there was not a moment to be lost.
###508 >> That was the first of September, and actually, we needed to be planting three weeks
###514 from that so we had to go ahead and get our seeds lined up.
###517 >> Of course, me and Ray and John got separated at the airport
###520 because our flights were different.
###523 I sat down and figured out how many acres I was going to have,
###526 and what I needed, and called home.
###528 And I had the seed ordered before I got home from North Dakota that year.
###532 >> We got the seeds lined up, and we had a good stand last year.
###534 We had a heck of a cover crop.
###536 [ Music ]
###550 >> The seeds they lined up with the typical species you'd find
###552 in a standard cool season cocktail for the southeast.
###558 >> We had some rye.
###559 >> Hairy vetch.
###560 >> Crimson clover.
###562 >> Purple-top turnips.
###563 >> Daikon radishes.
###564 >> Winter peas, gosh, we had a lot of cover last year.
###569 >> Of course, that's not the only mix.
###571 Farmers across the country have become very creative in the way they introduce diversity
###576 into their land, based on their resource needs, the season, and the crop rotation.
###582 Now when it comes to planting cover crops, I'm going to go with the advice
###587 that Dave Brandt gives to his fellow farmers.
###590 >> I think sometimes we tend to worry too much about it.
###593 You know, I think we try to be too professional because we're trying to worry about corn
###597 and beans, and making sure everything's right.
###599 Well, the opinion I have on cover crops is if you've got good weather
###602 and decent soil conditions, just get it out there.
###605 It seems to grow whether it comes out of an airplane, or of a spinner spreader,
###609 or of a drill or a planter -- so I guess there's no magic formula.
###613 Just get it done and get it out there.
###617 >> In our situation, we've actually broadcasted these cover crops,
###621 just using a traditional three-point hitch spreader, and have been successful in doing
###626 that on a smaller scale in our operation.
###630 >> The first year we did it we used John's sprayer and sprayed and used a spin spreader,
###638 but for some reason we got streaks in it.
###641 We're not sure what happened there, but in the fall of 2011 we defoliated the cotton
###651 with one sprayer, and then took the boom off the other, and put a pendulum back and forth motion
###656 to spreader on, and that seemed to work great.
###663 >> We decided this fall we did not broadcast.
###666 We put 800 acres in the ground this year with the drill.
###669 But it's also according to how your seasons run.
###672 I mean, the guys that maybe throwed it out broadcast it this fall, we had plenty of rain
###677 in the fall which that was a big help on the broadcasting side.
###681 In fact, there were some days that we couldn't run because it was too wet,
###685 so we did hold off a few days of planting because of rain.
###689 So -- but that's one of those things, you know.
###694 That's called farming, you know.
###697 >> There was no additional fertilizer added to those cover crops for establishment.
###702 They were just picking up off of residual N, and also any nitrogen
###707 that they were making while growing the legumes.
###710 [ Music ]
###726 Establishing these early, and then terminating them late in the growing season,
###730 usually when other producers have already planted their crops, allows the rye to get very,
###736 very tall, usually six feet or higher.
###738 So we saw a -- I'm not going to say a problem --
###742 but we saw a challenge as far as planting into that residue being so big.
###746 But we adapted, overcame, and have been successful with that.
###751 Last year was the first year that we actually rolled any cover crops down,
###755 but we saw the benefits of what you could do if you rolled it completely down.
###759 I let the rye get to soft dough stage, so as soon as it was snapped, it was terminated.
###763 But since we were not using a roller crimper, then we would have
###766 to use a herbicide to burn down the legumes.
###769 >> When we were doing the wheat cover crops, we didn't have to worry about rolling it.
###773 You know, we would just plant right into it.
###774 This rye's a different animal.
###776 You've got so much more biomass there, you've got to get it to the ground.
###780 And it's a lot easier as far as being able to see to plant.
###784 I would think it would be easier as far as the coulters
###787 and row planters to cut in it with it standing.
###789 I'll be honest.
###790 Our cover crop was so tall last year, we could not have planted it if we hadn't rolled it down.
###798 >> The timing of the burn-down application differs for Nathan, John, and Curtis.
###803 Their reasons are both practical and a matter of preference.
###806 For example, Nathan's sprayer is too small to get over the top
###810 so he has to spray once it's rolled.
###814 >> For our sprayer, we didn't have any trouble getting over the top of it.
###817 We have a high-clearance sprayer.
###819 >> We were putting more water down in there, and we were running high pressure,
###824 and we actually slowed up some, too.
###826 We slowed up our water pressure to get more water to blow it down in it.
###832 And I would terminate these crops probably about two to three days in front of the roller.
###838 We can get a better kill with the crops while they're still standing.
###843 >> Curtis just likes to get it done all at once.
###846 >> We took advantage of some of the equipment that we had on the farm
###850 that we've been using when we tilled the soil.
###853 It's like this cultipacker here.
###854 We're using it to roll rye and cover crop down, and we're spraying as we go behind it.
###861 And then we have this roller hard we hadn't used in years.
###864 We drug it out of the weeds, and put it behind the cultipacker.
###868 And we're actually double-rolling it and crimping it as we go,
###871 and it's breaking the rye up in pieces.
###874 We're saving one trip with a spray truck or sprayer and actually doing two jobs at one time,
###881 and it's worked out real great for us.
###883 [ Music ]
###897 >> For farmers who have never done this sort of thing before, planting into a rolled,
###901 high biomass cover crop is just plain scary.
###905 Our rookies had their share of problems in this phase, and yet seem to have come out on top.
###911 >> Again, after you roll those cover crops down,
###913 the timing of planting is going to be crucial also.
###917 >> We did have some wrapping issues on our row cleaner.
###919 But we had a situation where we did not get it sprayed like we wanted because of windy days.
###928 We have found that if you can plant in real green rye, or it be real dead.
###936 That in between, this rye gets tough when it's trying to dry down.
###941 So that was our main deal last year, in that tough stage.
###950 >> Late termination often brings with it the worry of low soil moisture at planting.
###956 Old hands like Ray Styer like to terminate as late as possible, but local conditions
###961 and sound judgment will always play a role.
###965 >> It's just like this.
###967 I would love to see -- after we terminate and lay it down, I'd love to see a good rain on it.
###972 That's going to add that soil moisture right there.
###974 When you lay that mat on top of it, you won't be disturbing your moisture again.
###980 We love to plant right after a rain, yeah.
###983 >> And as always, there's the talk of equipment.
###986 Again, there was no secret formula.
###989 >> We didn't make any major adjustments to our planter other than just keeping everything
###995 in tune, keeping coulters updated as needed.
###998 We did add a little bit of weight to our planter to make sure you could cut through the residue.
###1004 It's just a no-till coulter, double disk opener, and cast iron closing wheels.
###1009 >> I think one key thing there is keeping good sharp coulters on the planter.
###1013 You may not get but half the life out of them,
###1015 but getting a good stand is worth the difference there, keeping them sharp and then keeping good,
###1022 a close eye on your row cleaners, keeping them at the right depth.
###1026 And the ones I got -- just pull a pin and you could adjust them real easy.
###1031 >> And you might also want to ask whether they were always able to cut through that mat.
###1037 >> We did have some issues last year.
###1039 Our problem was on the turn-rows, where we would come out and try to cross
###1043 where the roller had laid it the other way.
###1045 Biggest thing, you want to follow that roller as close as possible,
###1050 as far as going with the way your rye has been laid down.
###1060 >> Given that rolled cover crop, I wanted
###1064 to know whether there was any effect on weed control.
###1068 >> The rolling down did definitely give a lot of benefits in weed control.
###1072 Having that uniform mat of heavy residue down only allowed sun
###1076 to penetrate where you were planting.
###1078 >> The weeds just can't come up through that thick mat.
###1081 We had about 98% weed control, good weed control this year.
###1089 >> I know what you're thinking.
###1091 All this talk about cover crops is nice and all, but how did crops respond in the growing season?
###1099 I visited a bit with Curtis and Nathan in August 2011, to see how things were going.
###1104 >> We definitely have seen the moisture retention, and with the soil health improving,
###1109 we're just seeing a lot healthier crops that we're planting.
###1116 >> Got a pretty decent stand, as you can see.
###1118 It's -- the spots have filled in great.
###1122 And I still have a whole lot of residue left on the ground, and the ground is still real moist.
###1129 I'm just tickled to death with it.
###1135 >> This here corn is a little over eight inches long.
###1137 We got 16 rows of kernels on it, and I'm looking at probably 200 bushel plus corn here.
###1147 I've been real pleased with it.
###1150 >> When we visited John's fields, his corn stands looked just as impressive.
###1156 >> Moisture, you could go out there on a dry day and kick the cover back,
###1160 and you could still see dark dirt.
###1164 I just love the idea of having that organic base, and having the soil temperatures
###1169 down during these hot June and July months.
###1174 Roots, is more bigger.
###1177 They seem to be looking for the moisture.
###1179 And what it is, they go and they find that moisture underneath that mat.
###1183 I'm really protecting myself for June and July.
###1186 That's what I look after when we're talking about cover crops.
###1190 >> You could rake that cover crop back and dig down just a little bit,
###1194 and earthworms are just crawling and eating them microbes, is the way Ray calls it.
###1200 >> But what Nathan showed me in some nearby fields just blew me away.
###1205 >> What we're looking at here is two different producers
###1208 that have two different management types for the cotton rotation that they are currently in.
###1215 We did take some soil temperature readings back when it was 105 one day.
###1220 In the field on the left you can see it was more or less reading 105 at an inch deep.
###1225 The field on the right was reading 85,
###1228 so we had right around approximately a 20 degree difference
###1231 in soil temperature between those two fields.
###1234 And just looking at -- I mean, side by side comparison, I mean, it tells the tale.
###1239 .
###1242 [ Music ]
###1246 >> There's an old management adage that says,
###1248 "If you cannot measure it, you cannot manage it."
###1251 Ultimately, it's the yield that provides us with the verdict for the cover crops.
###1256 >> Our first year that we did the cover crops, we saw a small yield increase.
###1260 Typical corn yields were 120 to 150 bushels of corn.
###1263 That year we were seeing, where we had the cover crops, 170, 180 bushel corn in comparison
###1269 to where we had the 150 right beside it.
###1272 >> Yield this year on dry land corn was -- we averaged 145 bushels.
###1278 I think the county average is 90.
###1280 I would be willing to say that we had a 10-bushel yield increase this year
###1285 on corn just because of the cover crops.
###1287 >> We had some good corn; 150, 175 bushel corn.
###1292 And I'd say where I used cover crops, they were 10% better.
###1298 >> We were right in the range of 1,200 pounds this year on cotton.
###1304 >> Everywhere that it was planted on time, and everything was done right,
###1311 it was 1,200- to 1,500-pound cotton.
###1313 And where there was no cover crop was probably 100 pounds less than that.
###1318 [ Music ]
###1328 >> If you're making a living on farming, you have to ask yourself, "Can I afford to do this?
###1334 Is there a benefit both now and in the future?"
###1337 >> Well, it seems like the seed cost is high.
###1339 But if you put a pencil to it, and what you're eventually going to get out of it, it's cheap.
###1344 >> Well, if you could take $7.00 corn, cover crops doubled what they cost us to put them in.
###1350 It made us money.
###1352 With corn, at $6.50 to $7.00, you know, you've got cotton in the $0.90 to $1.00 a pound range.
###1360 You cannot afford to leave anything on the table as far as trying to make the biggest returns.
###1370 And I don't know of a bigger return there is than soil moisture.
###1376 You reap what you sow.
###1378 It takes money to make money.
###1380 And these crops that we put out this year or last year,
###1383 that's going to work down into the soil.
###1385 That's going to be with us for a long time.
###1388 I can just see lots of benefits that could come down the road
###1390 from this, other than just a one-year deal.
###1392 >> The cover crop mix that we use could provide you anywhere from 50 to 150 units of nitrogen.
###1400 At current nitrogen costs per unit pound, it's more than paid for itself.
###1406 >> As far as the future is concerned, each of our friends has chosen his own path.
###1412 >> In the future, I could very well see in certain situations on a farm,
###1415 just depending on landscape, that we could grow our crops without any synthetic inputs.
###1421 >> I'm going to try cutting back, and also I'm going to do my own on-farm test on a few things
###1428 like planting with no fertilizing, and putting half of it, and then putting the full amount,
###1433 and maybe some extra, but I'm going to play with that some, too, this year.
###1438 >> We're so young in this program.
###1441 I think, before we start backing off on nutrients,
###1443 we need to have at least three to four years.
###1446 I would say probably down the road we're going
###1449 to cut nutrients back probably a third, maybe a half.
###1454 >> But are these expectations realistic?
###1457 Let's visit again with the guys who have been committed to this for a while.
###1461 >> The last seven years we've reduced our fertilizer cost by as much as 75%,
###1467 and I'm really hoping that in the next two years I can learn to reduce it to zero.
###1472 >> I haven't used any nitrogen on my corn since 1996.
###1479 >> We've cut our fertilizer by 90%, and our herbicide use by 75%,
###1484 and we have not reached a plateau yet.
###1487 I don't believe that anyone knows where the plateau is.
###1490 And we think that we're just going to keep pushing the system forward,
###1493 and see where it takes us from here.
###1495 [ Music ]
###1502 >> Oh my goodness, the no-till, same soil type.
###1506 Why did that happen?
###1508 Why did the no-till allow the water to go through?
###1513 Did you hear what Max said?
###1514 >> About 500 years ago, Niccolò Machiavelli wrote that "there is nothing more difficult
###1519 to carry out than to initiate a new order of things."
###1522 This is partly due to the incredulity of mankind, who would not believe in anything new
###1528 until they have actually experienced it.
###1531 But Stanly County has changed since that North Dakota trip.
###1537 >> We're coming home, and people, my neighbors, think --
###1541 they thought, "That poor boy has lost his mind.
###1543 He don't know what he -- he's going to lose his butt and have an auction sale this next fall."
###1548 But it's worked out, and they got an open mind to it now instead of turning their backs to it
###1553 and saying, "Oh, he's lost his mind."
###1555 And I've had a lot of people call me, and wanting to know what I'm doing,
###1561 how I'm doing it, and if it pays off, and I've tried to be as honest as I could with everybody
###1567 and tell them, "Yeah, it's worked good for me."
###1572 >> In Stanly County now, we're starting to see more and more producers adopt the use
###1576 of the cover crop mixes as we have more and more field days, more and more outreach trainings,
###1582 more producers are becoming aware of it, whether they see it or hear it from me,
###1587 hopefully see or hear it from their neighbor.
###1589 It makes me feel good to actually know that we've addressed a resource
###1594 and are doing good things to help conserve it.
###1698 The opinions expressed in this video are those of the farmers and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of USDA.
