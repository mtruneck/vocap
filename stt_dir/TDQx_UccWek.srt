0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,632



2
0:0:3,632 --> 0:0:6,17
MALE SPEAKER: We're in Sweden
to learn about a quirky


3
0:0:6,17 --> 0:0:8,91
geopolitical phenomenon
called micro-nations.


4
0:0:8,91 --> 0:0:11,91
They're sort of small,
self-declared countries that


5
0:0:11,91 --> 0:0:14,1
aren't actually recognized by
any other official government.


6
0:0:14,1 --> 0:0:16,152
This guy might be a
bit crazy, or--


7
0:0:16,152 --> 0:0:18,48
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it's
really hard to tell.


8
0:0:18,48 --> 0:0:21,952



9
0:0:21,952 --> 0:0:23,955
MALE SPEAKER: Now we are
guests in your country.


10
0:0:23,955 --> 0:0:26,14
MALE SPEAKER: We had a war
against the United States.


11
0:0:26,14 --> 0:0:26,92
MALE SPEAKER: Is that right?


12
0:0:26,92 --> 0:0:28,885
MALE SPEAKER: We thought they
had weapons of mass


13
0:0:28,885 --> 0:0:29,725
destruction.


14
0:0:29,725 --> 0:0:31,42
MALE SPEAKER: That's
the president?


15
0:0:31,42 --> 0:0:32,475
A pair of loafers?


16
0:0:32,475 --> 0:0:35,235
MALE SPEAKER: Listen, I would
have never accepted to be


17
0:0:35,235 --> 0:0:37,69
president where people who
thought they needed one.


18
0:0:37,69 --> 0:0:40,636



19
0:0:40,636 --> 0:0:42,6
We didn't rehearse
that, you know.


20
0:0:42,6 --> 0:0:48,1



21
0:0:48,1 --> 0:0:50,947
MALE SPEAKER: He's got dogs
that take [INAUDIBLE]


22
0:0:50,947 --> 0:0:52,197
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


23
0:0:52,197 --> 0:2:52,197
