1
0:0:6,64 --> 0:0:14,28
In that case, I will move on to introduce
Colonel Gordon Fullerton who got is bachelor's


2
0:0:14,28 --> 0:0:23,869
and master's degree from Caltech in mechanical
engineering, did ROTC and went on to the Air


3
0:0:23,869 --> 0:0:33,579
Force where, well, I guess he has flown, in
the course of his career about 135 different


4
0:0:33,579 --> 0:0:34,71
types of airplanes.


5
0:0:34,71 --> 0:0:39,42
16,000 flying hours.


6
0:0:39,42 --> 0:0:53,929
He flew F86 interceptors, B47 Bombers before
going to Air Force test pilot school in the


7
0:0:53,929 --> 0:0:54,55
mid `60s.


8
0:0:54,55 --> 0:1:1,969
In '66, he was chosen by the Air Force for
the Manned Orbiting Laboratory which was going


9
0:1:1,969 --> 0:1:7,49
to be the Air Force's Space Station.


10
0:1:7,49 --> 0:1:17,32
That program was cancelled in 1969 and the
MOL, well, some of the MOL astronauts came


11
0:1:17,32 --> 0:1:20,2
over to NASA and became NASA astronauts.


12
0:1:20,2 --> 0:1:25,49
That was in the heyday of Apollo.


13
0:1:25,49 --> 0:1:30,799
And Gordon was support crew on the last four
Apollo missions.


14
0:1:30,799 --> 0:1:40,57
Then went on to be the test pilot on three
of the first five approach and landing tests.


15
0:1:40,57 --> 0:1:46,6
If you remember, that is when the Shuttle
Enterprise, which was not designed for orbital


16
0:1:46,6 --> 0:1:51,439
flight but was designed to test basically
the last 50,000 feet down to the ground, was


17
0:1:51,439 --> 0:1:53,39
dropped from the 747.


18
0:1:53,39 --> 0:2:1,93
Went onto pilot the third Shuttle flight,
which was one of the orbital flight tests.


19
0:2:1,93 --> 0:2:4,549
That was the flight which landed in New Mexico.


20
0:2:4,549 --> 0:2:18,709
And then commanded STS-51F which was the first
flight of the instrument pointing system.


21
0:2:18,709 --> 0:2:27,25
That was also the flight, I am trying to think,
where you lost the engine, which we talked


22
0:2:27,25 --> 0:2:27,65
about.


23
0:2:27,65 --> 0:2:31,349
That was the one flight where we had an engine
shutdown.


24
0:2:31,349 --> 0:2:37,98
And we went over that in some detail.


25
0:2:37,98 --> 0:2:42,44
I think they should hear about it from what
it seemed like inside the cockpit, now that


26
0:2:42,44 --> 0:2:44,78
they have heard kind of the technical details.


27
0:2:44,78 --> 0:2:51,879
In any case, after leaving the Astronautic
Office, Gordon has moved into pilot's heaven


28
0:2:51,879 --> 0:2:59,55
which is Edwards Air Force Base, the Dryden
Test Flight Center where he basically spends


29
0:2:59,55 --> 0:3:0,879
all his time.


30
0:3:0,879 --> 0:3:3,989
Well, not all of his time because there is
management stuff as well.


31
0:3:3,989 --> 0:3:5,549
Unfortunately, that is the price you pay.


32
0:3:5,549 --> 0:3:9,18
But basically he gets to fly airplanes for
a living.


33
0:3:9,18 --> 0:3:15,87
And lots of different kinds, including the
career aircraft and the B52 which launches


34
0:3:15,87 --> 0:3:24,65
various test aircraft and a whole bunch of
other airplanes.


35
0:3:24,65 --> 0:3:31,12
If you remember in the whole systems engineering
approach to things, we talk about the conceived


36
0:3:31,12 --> 0:3:35,62
design, manufacture, test and operation.


37
0:3:35,62 --> 0:3:42,9
So this is basically the final lecture and
this is the test and operation of the Space


38
0:3:42,9 --> 0:3:44,45
Shuttle from a pilot's point of view.


39
0:3:44,45 --> 0:3:46,47
So, with that, I will give it to you, Gordon.


40
0:3:46,47 --> 0:3:50,98
Thanks.


41
0:3:50,98 --> 0:4:1,629
I was sitting at your place back in 1958 when
I was a grad student at Caltech for a year


42
0:4:1,629 --> 0:4:3,129
before heading off to the Air Force.


43
0:4:3,129 --> 0:4:8,45
Wow, almost 50 years ago.


44
0:4:8,45 --> 0:4:13,48
But the real blessing of my life is to be
able to do what I love to do for as long as


45
0:4:13,48 --> 0:4:17,35
I have done it, beyond all reason.


46
0:4:17,35 --> 0:4:20,22
Anyway, I hope to share some of that with
you this morning.


47
0:4:20,22 --> 0:4:21,97
This is my first time through this pitch.


48
0:4:21,97 --> 0:4:29,25
Feel free to holler out any questions as we
go and we will stumble through it together.


49
0:4:29,25 --> 0:4:42,79
I planned to talk about three different phases
of the orbiter test program.


50
0:4:42,79 --> 0:4:50,15
The first were called ALT, the Approach and
Landing Test, that consisted of really 13


51
0:4:50,15 --> 0:4:57,3
flights, five captive inert flights where
the enterprise was flown on top of the 747


52
0:4:57,3 --> 0:4:58,41
but nobody in the cockpit.


53
0:4:58,41 --> 0:5:0,61
The controls were locked.


54
0:5:0,61 --> 0:5:7,37
That was to clear the envelope for the kind
of unlikely looking combination of a 747 with


55
0:5:7,37 --> 0:5:9,29
an orbiter on top.


56
0:5:9,29 --> 0:5:14,82
And then there were three "captive active"
flights where we were manned up in the orbiter


57
0:5:14,82 --> 0:5:19,57
with the systems running, the electronics,
the hydraulics were active.


58
0:5:19,57 --> 0:5:23,5
The controls were free to move a little bit,
not full throw.


59
0:5:23,5 --> 0:5:28,73
And we also determined how high the combination
could get.


60
0:5:28,73 --> 0:5:38,23
Because altitude was not 50,000 feet, it was
more like 28,000 feet max even with the 747


61
0:5:38,23 --> 0:5:41,33
engines over boosted.


62
0:5:41,33 --> 0:5:47,7
Followed by three "free flights" were we actually
pushed the button, munched off the top and


63
0:5:47,7 --> 0:5:51,6
glided to a landing.


64
0:5:51,6 --> 0:5:56,79
The orbital flight test, prior to the Shuttle
Program, OFT consisted of four flights.


65
0:5:56,79 --> 0:6:2,66
STS 1 through 4 of varying durations.


66
0:6:2,66 --> 0:6:10,23
STS-1 was planned for just a couple days to
get up and get down and have a look at how


67
0:6:10,23 --> 0:6:11,3
things looked after it flew.


68
0:6:11,3 --> 0:6:13,59
STS-2 was supposed to be five days.


69
0:6:13,59 --> 0:6:19,5
They had a fuel cell problem that cut their
flight short, unfortunately for the crew.


70
0:6:19,5 --> 0:6:23,54
Then I was on STS-3.


71
0:6:23,54 --> 0:6:25,59
We were scheduled for seven days.


72
0:6:25,59 --> 0:6:32,4
And, because of a raging dust storm at the
planned landing site, we got an extra day.


73
0:6:32,4 --> 0:6:33,66
A real blessing.


74
0:6:33,66 --> 0:6:38,56
With no tests to do, we had a free day on
orbit.


75
0:6:38,56 --> 0:6:41,88
And ended up with eight days.


76
0:6:41,88 --> 0:6:48,85
STS-4 planned and flew seven days, landing
on the fourth of July with President Reagan


77
0:6:48,85 --> 0:6:50,55
out there to watch.


78
0:6:50,55 --> 0:6:55,74
And then we got into operational flights of
which there had been a lot.


79
0:6:55,74 --> 0:6:58,69
Something over a hundred.


80
0:6:58,69 --> 0:7:8,82
The last flight to fly, the return to flight
was STS-114, but the number system went through


81
0:7:8,82 --> 0:7:9,95
a couple of phases.


82
0:7:9,95 --> 0:7:12,86
There have not been 114 flights.


83
0:7:12,86 --> 0:7:17,44
I don't know how many it has been, but there
had been a bunch.


84
0:7:17,44 --> 0:7:24,58
I will talk about three, well, more than three
flights, but the ALT flights.


85
0:7:24,58 --> 0:7:32,69
If you have to have a crew patch, that is
a major hurdle that you have to overcome.


86
0:7:32,69 --> 0:7:37,14
When you are assigned to a crew, get the patch
designed and then get it approved by upper


87
0:7:37,14 --> 0:7:42,6
management.


88
0:7:42,6 --> 0:7:56,61
Part of the OFT, STS-3 in 1982 and finally
then an operational flight 51F in 1985.


89
0:7:56,61 --> 0:8:3,93
Prior to any of these flights, I worked into
a dream job for really systems engineering,


90
0:8:3,93 --> 0:8:6,8
I guess, and for a pilot.


91
0:8:6,8 --> 0:8:9,31
I had been to test pilot school.


92
0:8:9,31 --> 0:8:18,8
I was intrigued with all the airplanes I flew
with a cockpit design and was very aware of


93
0:8:18,8 --> 0:8:19,45
the flaws of cockpit design.


94
0:8:19,45 --> 0:8:28,77
It seems like sometimes engineers lie awake
nights trying to make it hard to operate subsystems.


95
0:8:28,77 --> 0:8:40,9
I got in at the beginning of the orbiter crew
interface and became, before it was over,


96
0:8:40,9 --> 0:8:46,7
sort of the Czar who was responsible to sign
off all the drawings, lots of reviews.


97
0:8:46,7 --> 0:8:56,39
It was a great responsibility because I was
immediately and early into subsystem design


98
0:8:56,39 --> 0:9:0,42
because you have to know what the subsystem
does to make any intelligent choice of what


99
0:9:0,42 --> 0:9:4,22
the controls and displays should be.


100
0:9:4,22 --> 0:9:13,58
This is a view of, not the Enterprise, but
probably, I don't know whether it is a simulator


101
0:9:13,58 --> 0:9:20,69
or the real airplane, they look alike, but
one of the orbital capable shuttles.


102
0:9:20,69 --> 0:9:26,96
This is like the little old ladies always
say when you're out on display for Armed Forces


103
0:9:26,96 --> 0:9:32,5
Day and look at all the things, how do you
remember what they all do?


104
0:9:32,5 --> 0:9:38,45
Well, that really is a challenge to make things
straightforward.


105
0:9:38,45 --> 0:9:47,65
And I became painfully aware, especially later
on when we had a lot of experiments coming


106
0:9:47,65 --> 0:9:56,65
in, that engineers in their little ivory tower
building a system in the lab are so totally,


107
0:9:56,65 --> 0:10:2,75
personally familiar with how their stuff works
that it doesn't bother them that the switches


108
0:10:2,75 --> 0:10:5,18
are unlabeled or labeled illogically.


109
0:10:5,18 --> 0:10:10,99
And they bring that all in and want to put
it in the orbiter.


110
0:10:10,99 --> 0:10:18,57
And when the crew says wait a minute, I have
to remember, before I turn on switch A, switch


111
0:10:18,57 --> 0:10:24,77
C and D have got to be turned on in this order
or the whole thing will blow up?


112
0:10:24,77 --> 0:10:26,63
And they say oh, yeah, that is the way it
is.


113
0:10:26,63 --> 0:10:29,5
And they know it so well personally.


114
0:10:29,5 --> 0:10:34,17
And, yet, when you are overwhelmed with a
whole lot of experiments, I am sure you ran


115
0:10:34,17 --> 0:10:43,78
into it on your flight, that all the stuff
that is just totally familiar to the guy that


116
0:10:43,78 --> 0:10:48,72
invented it becomes a challenge when you are
faced with a whole lot of them and a limited


117
0:10:48,72 --> 0:10:50,52
amount of time to learn it.


118
0:10:50,52 --> 0:10:58,44
And so, standardization of what the scheme,
especially in the software.


119
0:10:58,44 --> 0:11:8,85
While there are a lot of gadgets, in fact,
if you count all the switches, gauges, circuit


120
0:11:8,85 --> 0:11:14,44
breakers, upstairs, downstairs and the mid
deck, there are about 2,100 total in the orbiter


121
0:11:14,44 --> 0:11:17,8
cockpit.


122
0:11:17,8 --> 0:11:23,66
But the real challenge is what shows up on
the screens here.


123
0:11:23,66 --> 0:11:30,0
So the software was a bigger thing in making
them all play together.


124
0:11:30,0 --> 0:11:33,72
Here is a higher view in the overhead panel
above your head.


125
0:11:33,72 --> 0:11:37,43
And the forward cockpit has a lot of other
switches.


126
0:11:37,43 --> 0:11:47,66
An example of what I am talking about, this
array of switches right here controls the


127
0:11:47,66 --> 0:11:56,1
reaction control system valving and then the
orbital maneuvering system.


128
0:11:56,1 --> 0:12:5,7
Back in Apollo, which I worked on when I first
came to Johnson Space Center, I learned, while


129
0:12:5,7 --> 0:12:13,72
lying many hours in the Apollo crew simulator,
that that had the worst cockpit every designed


130
0:12:13,72 --> 0:12:16,44
by man.


131
0:12:16,44 --> 0:12:25,81
As an example, it had a helium pressurization
system to push the propellants for the reaction


132
0:12:25,81 --> 0:12:31,18
control jets out of the tanks and then the
valves that went to the various arrays of


133
0:12:31,18 --> 0:12:34,9
thrusters all around the command module.


134
0:12:34,9 --> 0:12:40,37
And one would think logically, if you have
something to turn on the helium, you label


135
0:12:40,37 --> 0:12:42,23
that helium on/off.


136
0:12:42,23 --> 0:12:51,29
And then the manifold, the next branch in
the Christmas tree manifold would be system


137
0:12:51,29 --> 0:12:53,55
A versus system B or something like that.


138
0:12:53,55 --> 0:12:55,86
And, in fact, it had names like that.


139
0:12:55,86 --> 0:13:3,38
But they put the switches in a long room and
labeled them A through H, right there on the


140
0:13:3,38 --> 0:13:5,16
panel.


141
0:13:5,16 --> 0:13:10,67
No clue as to what you were throwing, so every
move you made in the cockpit, some of these


142
0:13:10,67 --> 0:13:19,63
things were critical, required you to either
be a metal giant or open a checklist and say


143
0:13:19,63 --> 0:13:29,73
to pressurize system B, I have got to throw
B on and then A next and then H last or something


144
0:13:29,73 --> 0:13:30,17
like that.


145
0:13:30,17 --> 0:13:34,47
Obviously, unacceptable.


146
0:13:34,47 --> 0:13:41,91
It became my career and mania to try to improve
that.


147
0:13:41,91 --> 0:13:49,52
The first orbiter simulator built was called
the OAS, Orbiter Aeroflight Simulator.


148
0:13:49,52 --> 0:13:58,67
It was on a moving based platform like the
standard airline simulators you see today.


149
0:13:58,67 --> 0:14:2,26
This is Fred Hayes and I sitting in the cockpit.


150
0:14:2,26 --> 0:14:5,57
This one was built originally to be the Enterprise.


151
0:14:5,57 --> 0:14:15,88
And the Enterprise was OV-101 in the scheme
of things, a numbering of orbiters as they


152
0:14:15,88 --> 0:14:17,9
were built.


153
0:14:17,9 --> 0:14:23,23
101 had only the systems it needed to fly
the approach and landing test.


154
0:14:23,23 --> 0:14:28,35
The plan was to retrofit it later to make
it into orbit capable.


155
0:14:28,35 --> 0:14:38,0
But before the ALT program it had just what
you needed and only that to fly in the atmosphere


156
0:14:38,0 --> 0:14:39,74
very short flights.


157
0:14:39,74 --> 0:14:46,95
But this is our first chance to look at what
we had and what we were getting into as far


158
0:14:46,95 --> 0:14:50,35
as pilot concerns.


159
0:14:50,35 --> 0:14:52,99
Now, I guess you have had all the subsystems,
right?


160
0:14:52,99 --> 0:14:58,69
You were all completely briefed and experts
on subsystems by the people that had preceded


161
0:14:58,69 --> 0:15:0,36
me here in the course.


162
0:15:0,36 --> 0:15:7,15
I will give you, though, a quick review here,
the avionics system.


163
0:15:7,15 --> 0:15:15,279
The Shuttle is build with inside the outer
mole line as the pressure vessel that is roughly


164
0:15:15,279 --> 0:15:24,86
back to the forward bulkhead of the payload
bay and is imbedded inside basically aluminum


165
0:15:24,86 --> 0:15:30,6
structure with a thermal protection system
applied to the outside.


166
0:15:30,6 --> 0:15:38,18
And most of the avionics are in racks right
up here, right in there with you in the cockpit


167
0:15:38,18 --> 0:15:39,85
on the middeck.


168
0:15:39,85 --> 0:15:48,32
The stowage lockers are aft of the racks full
of black boxes and lots of wires.


169
0:15:48,32 --> 0:15:53,69
And the other place there were avionics is
back here just after the aft bulkhead of the


170
0:15:53,69 --> 0:15:54,46
payload bay.


171
0:15:54,46 --> 0:16:1,57
And there are some areas where they put items
like rate gyros and accelerometers.


172
0:16:1,57 --> 0:16:10,43
A lot way back.


173
0:16:10,43 --> 0:16:18,87
From a systems engineering standpoint, Fred
Hayes and I were out at Palmdale where they


174
0:16:18,87 --> 0:16:20,86
built all the orbiters.


175
0:16:20,86 --> 0:16:32,22
It seems like the testing always happens after
2:00 AM, tests would run around the clock.


176
0:16:32,22 --> 0:16:39,77
And we were out there way after midnight in
the cockpit participating in the first time


177
0:16:39,77 --> 0:16:44,85
they were going to close the loop between
the rate gyros and the flight control system


178
0:16:44,85 --> 0:16:51,4
which is contained back up here in the nose
and the general purpose computers.


179
0:16:51,4 --> 0:16:58,69
The whole orbiter was suspended on some big
airfield bag so it had compliance to move.


180
0:16:58,69 --> 0:17:5,89
And the hydraulic system was on powered by
a facility hydraulic source.


181
0:17:5,89 --> 0:17:13,85
The elevons were powered and the rudder speed
brake was powered and the process let us down


182
0:17:13,85 --> 0:17:20,66
for the very first time that we were going
to close the loop between the software up


183
0:17:20,66 --> 0:17:27,199
here and the rate gyros particularly and accelerometers
mounted in the back.


184
0:17:27,199 --> 0:17:29,22
And it was a milestone.


185
0:17:29,22 --> 0:17:36,29
And we had people stationed around the back
to see if anything spit out hydraulic fluid


186
0:17:36,29 --> 0:17:39,24
or whatever.


187
0:17:39,24 --> 0:17:44,29
Anyway, we went up to the glass shield and
pushed the button to go into CSS, Control


188
0:17:44,29 --> 0:17:51,27
Stick Steering, which hooked the stick up
now to the flight control system.


189
0:17:51,27 --> 0:17:55,54
I will never forget.


190
0:17:55,54 --> 0:18:1,12
We pushed the button and a rumble started.


191
0:18:1,12 --> 0:18:4,36
And the rumble built very rapidly to a violent
rumble.


192
0:18:4,36 --> 0:18:7,62
I mean we were being bounced around the cockpit.


193
0:18:7,62 --> 0:18:15,59
This is 150,000 pounds of airplane dancing
on these rubber bags.


194
0:18:15,59 --> 0:18:19,64
And it didn't take us long to say this doesn't
feel good.


195
0:18:19,64 --> 0:18:25,44
We pulled the button that downloads back to
direct control so there is no feedback.


196
0:18:25,44 --> 0:18:30,809
And the upshot of it was that these rate gyros
are mounted on this flexible bulkhead.


197
0:18:30,809 --> 0:18:35,89
And that had been taken into account properly.


198
0:18:35,89 --> 0:18:41,38
And so there was a structural resonance that
was just diversion.


199
0:18:41,38 --> 0:18:49,2
In spite of all the Grounds tests down at
Downy and the Iron Bird mockups and everything,


200
0:18:49,2 --> 0:18:58,19
when we put it in the real airplane it tried
to jump off the supports.


201
0:18:58,19 --> 0:19:6,16
And Fred and I were in the cockpit, our eyes
were big, and we called the control room which


202
0:19:6,16 --> 0:19:8,37
were people back in an adjacent room.


203
0:19:8,37 --> 0:19:14,6
It seems like most spacecraft tests, traditionally,
are done with engineers all locked up in windowless


204
0:19:14,6 --> 0:19:16,85
room, no view of the real hardware.


205
0:19:16,85 --> 0:19:23,39
Down at the Cape they are miles away when
the spacecraft is either out on the pad or


206
0:19:23,39 --> 0:19:26,3
in the main checkout building.


207
0:19:26,3 --> 0:19:34,3
And so they said no, the procedure says this
is OK and we want you to re-engage.


208
0:19:34,3 --> 0:19:37,37
We tried one more time.


209
0:19:37,37 --> 0:19:42,63
And this time the guy stationed in back that
were watching said this doesn't look good.


210
0:19:42,63 --> 0:19:46,3
They started hollering on the loop so we pitched
it off.


211
0:19:46,3 --> 0:19:50,67
And we went into a raging argument.


212
0:19:50,67 --> 0:19:53,4
We need to complete this test, the engineers
were saying.


213
0:19:53,4 --> 0:19:56,42
And we were saying we don't want to break
something.


214
0:19:56,42 --> 0:20:1,8
And they got people out of bed down in California,
controls engineers.


215
0:20:1,8 --> 0:20:7,53
And so, it was a memorable night.


216
0:20:7,53 --> 0:20:16,52
The resolution was finally a redesign of the
mounting area back there and reanalysis of


217
0:20:16,52 --> 0:20:21,7
the vibrational modes of the aft bulkhead
sorted all out.


218
0:20:21,7 --> 0:20:31,54
Here is what we had for a crew interface.


219
0:20:31,54 --> 0:20:38,78
You saw in the earlier picture, upfront three
CRTs, monochrome, green, it was either green


220
0:20:38,78 --> 0:20:45,53
or nothing on the screen, and we had two keyboards,
three CRTs.


221
0:20:45,53 --> 0:20:49,71
There was always this little concern, when
you are punching on a keyboard, you want to


222
0:20:49,71 --> 0:20:55,22
be sure it is selected to the CRT you think
you are doing something on.


223
0:20:55,22 --> 0:20:58,799
Another marginal design, but that is what
we ended up with.


224
0:20:58,799 --> 0:21:2,65
You notice we have a hexadecimal keyboard
here.


225
0:21:2,65 --> 0:21:13,3
We have some strange keys called item and
electric and ops which had to do with this


226
0:21:13,3 --> 0:21:17,79
truly unique way you cause things to happen
through software.


227
0:21:17,79 --> 0:21:21,38
And lots of things were critical through software.


228
0:21:21,38 --> 0:21:24,53
And then this rather dim green screen.


229
0:21:24,53 --> 0:21:30,71
This was way before the days, I guess, Bill
Gates was still here at MIT or maybe even


230
0:21:30,71 --> 0:21:32,27
hadn't registered yet.


231
0:21:32,27 --> 0:21:32,97
I don't know.


232
0:21:32,97 --> 0:21:36,63
It was way before Windows 1.0.


233
0:21:36,63 --> 0:21:45,17
And so it seems almost comical now when you
compare it to even modern airliner crew interface


234
0:21:45,17 --> 0:21:51,49
with glass cockpits, but we were breaking
new ground here.


235
0:21:51,49 --> 0:21:58,59
And it, even at the time, seemed antiquated
because that is all they were willing to embrace


236
0:21:58,59 --> 0:22:3,29
in the way of computer control and design.


237
0:22:3,29 --> 0:22:4,62
And it was unique.


238
0:22:4,62 --> 0:22:13,25
And it causes lots of headaches and delays.


239
0:22:13,25 --> 0:22:23,41
The big thing about the orbiter with its data
process system, the decision was made that


240
0:22:23,41 --> 0:22:29,19
everything is going to be done with these
all powerful general purpose computers in


241
0:22:29,19 --> 0:22:33,12
which there were five in an array that worked
together.


242
0:22:33,12 --> 0:22:41,94
Flight control, system management, navigation,
inertial subsystem control of everything.


243
0:22:41,94 --> 0:22:50,88
And so, the result was the software loads,
as they were built, had lots of flaws when


244
0:22:50,88 --> 0:22:54,49
they came down, yet we couldn't fix them.


245
0:22:54,49 --> 0:23:4,0
We had cases as dumb as a display that showed
the Freon loop A pump on.


246
0:23:4,0 --> 0:23:9,6
And, when it got through the entire software
belt, it was backwards.


247
0:23:9,6 --> 0:23:12,65
It would say off when it was really on.


248
0:23:12,65 --> 0:23:14,25
Seems like a simple fix, right?


249
0:23:14,25 --> 0:23:20,12
Go back to the programmer and rewrite the
code.


250
0:23:20,12 --> 0:23:21,73
But we couldn't do it.


251
0:23:21,73 --> 0:23:25,85
We had to live with it for a long period of
time through training until another whole


252
0:23:25,85 --> 0:23:27,64
load was built.


253
0:23:27,64 --> 0:23:35,4
Because the load that would fix this dumb
little bi-level mistake was also the one that


254
0:23:35,4 --> 0:23:38,21
steered you during ascent.


255
0:23:38,21 --> 0:23:42,679
So everything was frozen and there was great
fear of changing anything that would ricochet


256
0:23:42,679 --> 0:23:45,179
through to something truly critical.


257
0:23:45,179 --> 0:23:57,7
And so, even when we got to STS-3, we flew
with a book about this thick of program notes


258
0:23:57,7 --> 0:24:6,59
that told you, line after line, what was wrong,
what was backwards, what was a trap.


259
0:24:6,59 --> 0:24:12,54
And really a big challenge to the crew to
embrace and live with because there just wasn't


260
0:24:12,54 --> 0:24:19,73
time in the program to build another load,
check it out through all the different labs


261
0:24:19,73 --> 0:24:26,88
that had to certify it.


262
0:24:26,88 --> 0:24:32,86
That is load for modular software where you
can change something here and be assured you


263
0:24:32,86 --> 0:24:40,26
are not bollixing up something else in the
same machine.


264
0:24:40,26 --> 0:24:41,49
OMS, RCS.


265
0:24:41,49 --> 0:24:43,9
These are the two pods.


266
0:24:43,9 --> 0:24:50,1
On either side of the vertical tail are a
couple big OMS, propellant tanks, oxidizer


267
0:24:50,1 --> 0:24:51,86
and fuel hypergolic.


268
0:24:51,86 --> 0:24:53,419
We didn't need any ignition system.


269
0:24:53,419 --> 0:24:59,89
As soon as these came together in a thruster
you had thrust.


270
0:24:59,89 --> 0:25:4,14
And there were, I think, 44 main thrusters.


271
0:25:4,14 --> 0:25:8,41
Here are four yaw jets firing out to the side.


272
0:25:8,41 --> 0:25:11,12
S&B pitch jets.


273
0:25:11,12 --> 0:25:13,59
The same thing repeated on the other side.


274
0:25:13,59 --> 0:25:16,91
And up in the nose are the forward RCS.


275
0:25:16,91 --> 0:25:20,61
They had jets that fired up and out to the
side and down.


276
0:25:20,61 --> 0:25:26,919
And I mentioned the controls in the cockpit,
which we did.


277
0:25:26,919 --> 0:25:36,16
One of my great successes was getting the
orbiter panels to be arranged in a plumbing


278
0:25:36,16 --> 0:25:40,65
layout so that you could see what you were
pressurizing when you turned on the helium


279
0:25:40,65 --> 0:25:44,19
for a given let and that sort of thing.


280
0:25:44,19 --> 0:25:53,34
Helium tanks are what pressurized in a really
cleaver system of OH control.


281
0:25:53,34 --> 0:26:0,679
That is when you are in zero G and you have
propellant floating around randomly.


282
0:26:0,679 --> 0:26:4,72
And you turn on the helium to push it toward
the outlet.


283
0:26:4,72 --> 0:26:10,51
If the outlet is uncovered, the helium is
going to squirt right out.


284
0:26:10,51 --> 0:26:17,59
But they had an elaborate system of surface
tension kind of baffles that kept and trapped


285
0:26:17,59 --> 0:26:24,73
fuel near the outlet of the tank so that when
the thrust came on and all the propellant


286
0:26:24,73 --> 0:26:32,419
went down where it should, it sort of recharged
this chamber at the bottom of the tanks to


287
0:26:32,419 --> 0:26:38,669
keep it flowing smoothly and not lose all
the pressurization.


288
0:26:38,669 --> 0:26:53,66
I remember my first impression of what reaction
control jets would be like was based on science


289
0:26:53,66 --> 0:27:0,169
fiction movies where you would see the spacecraft
out there and there were little squirts of


290
0:27:0,169 --> 0:27:2,64
jets that nudge you around.


291
0:27:2,64 --> 0:27:9,74
And we went out to the Ground test facility
at White Sands on a fieldtrip out there where


292
0:27:9,74 --> 0:27:16,7
they actually had the forward RCS setup, and
they were going to do real firings of the


293
0:27:16,7 --> 0:27:19,49
main jets out there.


294
0:27:19,49 --> 0:27:24,25
And we were probably a couple hundred feet
away from the test setup.


295
0:27:24,25 --> 0:27:33,309
We were out there waiting for this sequence
of jet firing to start on a test.


296
0:27:33,309 --> 0:27:41,77
And the first firing of one of the main jets,
which are right up around 900 pounds thrust,


297
0:27:41,77 --> 0:27:42,86
was just this short pulse.


298
0:27:42,86 --> 0:27:46,47
And everybody went about three feet off the
ground.


299
0:27:46,47 --> 0:27:49,77
I mean it was like you fired a howitzer.


300
0:27:49,77 --> 0:27:51,44
It was just stunning.


301
0:27:51,44 --> 0:27:56,0
Wham, wham, and it just blew you away.


302
0:27:56,0 --> 0:27:59,38
And the realization of we are going to be
in the cockpit here, and these things are


303
0:27:59,38 --> 0:28:3,75
firing right outside the windshield.


304
0:28:3,75 --> 0:28:4,52
They did.


305
0:28:4,52 --> 0:28:9,49
In space, the ignition transient ricochets
through the structure.


306
0:28:9,49 --> 0:28:12,58
You can hear this kind of bombing effect.


307
0:28:12,58 --> 0:28:18,19
But once they are on, if it is a long duration
firing, it is silent.


308
0:28:18,19 --> 0:28:25,39
And the same way visually, you can see a flash
when the fuel is led a little bit in front


309
0:28:25,39 --> 0:28:28,429
of the oxidizer to make sure you don't overheat
something.


310
0:28:28,429 --> 0:28:31,27
And so, there is incomplete combustion at
the ignition.


311
0:28:31,27 --> 0:28:32,789
You can see a flash go out there.


312
0:28:32,789 --> 0:28:38,88
But what is on during an OMS burn, for instance,
when these OMS engines are firing and you


313
0:28:38,88 --> 0:28:42,929
are looking back at the aft, you see the flash
and they are on and they are pushing and you


314
0:28:42,929 --> 0:28:43,47
can feel it.


315
0:28:43,47 --> 0:28:48,6
But otherwise invisible is the way I remember.


316
0:28:48,6 --> 0:28:51,85
On the other hand, there are vernier jets,
little guys.


317
0:28:51,85 --> 0:28:53,75
I don't know if they are shown here.


318
0:28:53,75 --> 0:29:0,75
But there are little 25 pound thrusters or
something used 98% of the time on orbit.


319
0:29:0,75 --> 0:29:5,179
You really are doing that kind of thing with
the vernier jets.


320
0:29:5,179 --> 0:29:9,179
And you cannot hear those or see anything
when they are going off.


321
0:29:9,179 --> 0:29:16,179
In fact, we got everybody quiet and kind of
held onto the walls just trying to see if


322
0:29:16,179 --> 0:29:22,88
we could barely detect when a vernier jet
fired physically in a cockpit.


323
0:29:22,88 --> 0:29:29,57
Interesting.


324
0:29:29,57 --> 0:29:36,66
The orbiter is one giant heat transfer machine.


325
0:29:36,66 --> 0:29:45,47
Lots of calories of heat energy pumped around
from one end to the other.


326
0:29:45,47 --> 0:29:53,87
And so, there are water loops within the cabin
that transfer the heat to Freon loops.


327
0:29:53,87 --> 0:30:0,19
The fluid is pumped through the radiators
to reject heat.


328
0:30:0,19 --> 0:30:8,48
In spite of all these heat rejection systems
then there are heaters everywhere, whole banks


329
0:30:8,48 --> 0:30:10,15
of heaters to keep stuff from freezing.


330
0:30:10,15 --> 0:30:19,9
Then for the landing and takeoff phases, there
are flash evaporators that flash water and/or


331
0:30:19,9 --> 0:30:23,299
ammonia.


332
0:30:23,299 --> 0:30:32,59
When you are down in the atmosphere you use
ammonia to cool the loops.


333
0:30:32,59 --> 0:30:35,58
And, of course, the payload bay doors are
closed.


334
0:30:35,58 --> 0:30:44,86
And it turns out STS-3, a major test of it
was test all these loops and how the structure


335
0:30:44,86 --> 0:30:51,71
responded to long durations of given attitudes
with the sun shining on one side and cold


336
0:30:51,71 --> 0:30:58,91
space on the other side and how the structure
would distort or hopefully not distort and


337
0:30:58,91 --> 0:31:0,74
how all that system would work.


338
0:31:0,74 --> 0:31:7,75
As it turned out, if you like lots of redundancy,
this is probably the weak point I thought


339
0:31:7,75 --> 0:31:12,49
in the whole orbiter design, we've got three
engines.


340
0:31:12,49 --> 0:31:16,14
We proved that you can get there with only
two.


341
0:31:16,14 --> 0:31:22,86
But the Freon loops, there were two redundant
through the radiators.


342
0:31:22,86 --> 0:31:28,32
And if one Freon loop pumped quick you are
in a severe emergency.


343
0:31:28,32 --> 0:31:31,549
That means stop everything and power down
severely.


344
0:31:31,549 --> 0:31:44,2
Turn off all the computers except one, get
in a proper attitude and go into a panic reconfiguration


345
0:31:44,2 --> 0:31:45,62
to come back and land.


346
0:31:45,62 --> 0:31:49,85
Originally, the design had three Freon loops.


347
0:31:49,85 --> 0:31:56,37
It could use one and go on with no concern.


348
0:31:56,37 --> 0:32:7,559
But, as it turned out, the heat loads were
so high and the weight criticality determined


349
0:32:7,559 --> 0:32:13,82
that all we had electrical power to run were
two loops.


350
0:32:13,82 --> 0:32:19,59
And so we ended up with a single Freon loop
which fortunately, as far as I know, never


351
0:32:19,59 --> 0:32:20,809
failed.


352
0:32:20,809 --> 0:32:30,3
But if it had it would have been a crash deorbit
landing under severely powered down conditions.


353
0:32:30,3 --> 0:32:38,12
While it is kind of mundane and people don't
think about it as a primary system, the thermal


354
0:32:38,12 --> 0:32:42,49
control really was critical.


355
0:32:42,49 --> 0:32:50,23
Payload bay doors, this is a busy chart but
indicates these are really complicated.


356
0:32:50,23 --> 0:33:3,289
60 feet long and something like 120 little
motor driven latches to latch them closed.


357
0:33:3,289 --> 0:33:10,69
And you don't just go chunk close like the
bomb bay on a B52 and it is closed.


358
0:33:10,69 --> 0:33:17,2
To close the payload bay doors you get them
close and then the latches along the bulked,


359
0:33:17,2 --> 0:33:20,549
all in a zipper fashion, have to sequentially
close.


360
0:33:20,549 --> 0:33:29,559
And then you go down the center section to
latch the two left and right doors together.


361
0:33:29,559 --> 0:33:33,179
All software controlled.


362
0:33:33,179 --> 0:33:39,95
And there was a lot of concern that we address
on STS-3 particularly about whether this is


363
0:33:39,95 --> 0:33:41,21
all going to work.


364
0:33:41,21 --> 0:33:47,82
If you have been floating around with these
pointed to dark space, would they distort


365
0:33:47,82 --> 0:33:50,83
to where the zipper scheme would work?


366
0:33:50,83 --> 0:34:0,5
We worried about it enough that part of our
emergency training, contingency training,


367
0:34:0,5 --> 0:34:7,799
a lot of time was spent underwater in the
neutral buoyancy tank looking at a system


368
0:34:7,799 --> 0:34:18,129
going out EVA with a series of come-alongs,
you know, the kind of things you use to pull


369
0:34:18,129 --> 0:34:28,519
the motor out a car, that kind of thing, that
we could go down there and hookup and latch


370
0:34:28,519 --> 0:34:37,739
the doors shut to actually manually get them
shut and then latch them shut with these.


371
0:34:37,739 --> 0:34:39,19
Fortunately, that has never been used.


372
0:34:39,19 --> 0:34:46,839
And this complex system has worked good, but
it was scary the first time we flew it on


373
0:34:46,839 --> 0:34:47,729
STS-3.


374
0:34:47,729 --> 0:34:50,2
That was a big concern.


375
0:34:50,2 --> 0:34:58,819
What I have got here is hydraulic system.


376
0:34:58,819 --> 0:35:8,269
Hydraulics are hydrazine powered turbines
that run at some ridiculous RPM, like 200,000


377
0:35:8,269 --> 0:35:12,95
RPM to drive hydraulic pumps back here in
the backend.


378
0:35:12,95 --> 0:35:19,89
And then they are crucial during launch because
they have got to hold the elevons in position.


379
0:35:19,89 --> 0:35:28,19
But they also have to provide the muscle to
gimbal the main engines and keep you steering


380
0:35:28,19 --> 0:35:31,4
straight during launch.


381
0:35:31,4 --> 0:35:37,16
During entry they are what you use to fly
when you get into a dynamic pressure situation.


382
0:35:37,16 --> 0:35:40,969
Control the rudder speed brake and the body
flap.


383
0:35:40,969 --> 0:35:48,369
The body flap is a big surface that sticks
out underneath the main engine bells and is


384
0:35:48,369 --> 0:35:50,859
a slow moving trem device.


385
0:35:50,859 --> 0:35:52,9
The body flat is always moved.


386
0:35:52,9 --> 0:35:59,869
You go through this mach 25 to mach zero envelope.


387
0:35:59,869 --> 0:36:7,2
And the trem conditions necessary with these
big elevons varies a lot.


388
0:36:7,2 --> 0:36:14,15
So, to desaturate the elevons and keep them
basically faired with the wing, the body flap


389
0:36:14,15 --> 0:36:16,46
is your trim device.


390
0:36:16,46 --> 0:36:21,839
And it is like this row of tables long and
this wide.


391
0:36:21,839 --> 0:36:25,44
I remember asking to see the motor.


392
0:36:25,44 --> 0:36:31,99
It is driven by a whole lot of mechanical
advantage by a hydraulic motor.


393
0:36:31,99 --> 0:36:34,119
A guy took me around.


394
0:36:34,119 --> 0:36:36,869
I couldn't find the actuator for the body
flap.


395
0:36:36,869 --> 0:36:37,349
He showed me.


396
0:36:37,349 --> 0:36:41,119
The motor was this big around and this long,
a little hydraulic motor.


397
0:36:41,119 --> 0:36:45,13
So you can do anything with mechanical advantage.


398
0:36:45,13 --> 0:36:47,9
But it didn't have to move very fast.


399
0:36:47,9 --> 0:36:54,71
Finally, on the system pictures here, the
RMS.


400
0:36:54,71 --> 0:36:56,519
Hopefully, you have heard about this.


401
0:36:56,519 --> 0:36:59,45
It was built by Spara up in Canada.


402
0:36:59,45 --> 0:37:3,44
The Canadians main contribution to the orbiter
program.


403
0:37:3,44 --> 0:37:5,38
A pretty magical device.


404
0:37:5,38 --> 0:37:13,859
It can go on either side, but for our flights
mounted on the left-hand side or the right


405
0:37:13,859 --> 0:37:16,64
if you're looking out the back windows at
it.


406
0:37:16,64 --> 0:37:25,799
And it had joints logically called the shoulder
joint, elbow, wrist joint.


407
0:37:25,799 --> 0:37:29,969
All electric motor driven.


408
0:37:29,969 --> 0:37:32,279
But the interesting thing was a control.


409
0:37:32,279 --> 0:37:39,249
You had hand controllers mounted in the aft
part on the right console in the back where


410
0:37:39,249 --> 0:37:40,16
you looked out.


411
0:37:40,16 --> 0:37:46,9
And you could work in the mode where you actually
drive in the end left, right, up, down, in,


412
0:37:46,9 --> 0:37:50,59
out without regard to whatever joint was done.


413
0:37:50,59 --> 0:37:52,39
That is all resolved by the software.


414
0:37:52,39 --> 0:37:54,229
And worked well.


415
0:37:54,229 --> 0:38:0,96
The end effector was a cleaver kind of a hallow
cylindrical device.


416
0:38:0,96 --> 0:38:12,259
It would rotate inside and three cables that
would be curved around the periphery inside


417
0:38:12,259 --> 0:38:15,95
this cavity when activated.


418
0:38:15,95 --> 0:38:22,369
I put this over a post on whatever you wanted
to grab onto with a knob on the end.


419
0:38:22,369 --> 0:38:27,42
You go over the post and then rotate the inner
barrel and the cables would wrap up and grab


420
0:38:27,42 --> 0:38:28,93
onto the post.


421
0:38:28,93 --> 0:38:31,88
And then they would retract in to rigidize.


422
0:38:31,88 --> 0:38:34,549
And that was the grabber on the RMS.


423
0:38:34,549 --> 0:38:38,79
And we flew this on STS-3.


424
0:38:38,79 --> 0:38:39,109
I will show you later.


425
0:38:39,109 --> 0:38:45,729
Anyway, that is the subsystem review.


426
0:38:45,729 --> 0:38:51,339
Let me show you how things went during approach
and landing tests.


427
0:38:51,339 --> 0:38:52,15
Now, let's see.


428
0:38:52,15 --> 0:39:1,17
I have never figured out how to imbed video
and PowerPoint so I am going to be doing it


429
0:39:1,17 --> 0:39:1,66
manually.


430
0:39:1,66 --> 0:39:21,18
Any questions while we are waiting on this
to come up?


431
0:39:21,18 --> 0:39:28,489
Well, this is the desert around where I live
and a Gila monster and a Joshua tree to set


432
0:39:28,489 --> 0:39:29,49
the scene.


433
0:39:29,49 --> 0:39:33,999
And here you have OV-101.


434
0:39:33,999 --> 0:39:38,789
The numbering system, as it turned out, is
kind of interesting.


435
0:39:38,789 --> 0:39:42,589
They built OV-99 as the structural test article.


436
0:39:42,589 --> 0:39:49,71
It was strictly built to be in the lab and
do all the structural testing on it.


437
0:39:49,71 --> 0:39:58,839
101 then was the first orbiter build, the
Enterprise, being hauled from Palmdale across


438
0:39:58,839 --> 0:40:3,739
the backgrounds and the desert roads to get
over to Edwards in these scenes.


439
0:40:3,739 --> 0:40:6,91
And 101 was the ALT airplane.


440
0:40:6,91 --> 0:40:10,91
You can see kind of phony looking RCS.


441
0:40:10,91 --> 0:40:18,349
It has, as I mentioned, only the systems that
you needed to fly atmospheric flight.


442
0:40:18,349 --> 0:40:23,44
This was a big thing getting it across the
country.


443
0:40:23,44 --> 0:40:26,64
It had a Pitot boom on it.


444
0:40:26,64 --> 0:40:30,42
It has just simulated thermal protection.


445
0:40:30,42 --> 0:40:37,9
Styrofoam painted to look kind of like they
thought the space vehicles would look but


446
0:40:37,9 --> 0:40:38,29
wasn't real.


447
0:40:38,29 --> 0:40:46,89
It was put in the mating and docking device
which is at NASA Dryden where I work now.


448
0:40:46,89 --> 0:40:46,88
Hoisted it up.


449
0:40:46,88 --> 0:40:54,479
And then the 747 and 905, the first Shuttle
carrier aircraft, was pulled under and they


450
0:40:54,479 --> 0:40:55,119
mated them up.


451
0:40:55,119 --> 0:41:0,709
I remember flying out to Edwards and seeing
this unlikely combination.


452
0:41:0,709 --> 0:41:6,809
And the first time I saw the two together,
I thought they cannot be serious.


453
0:41:6,809 --> 0:41:10,239
But then I realized I was going to be in it.


454
0:41:10,239 --> 0:41:14,559
There were 13 total flights.


455
0:41:14,559 --> 0:41:17,469
This is a taxi test.


456
0:41:17,469 --> 0:41:21,45
When you have an aerodynamic test you can
sneak up, and so you do baby steps.


457
0:41:21,45 --> 0:41:26,65
This was just a high speed down the runway
to see if it would rotate and if anything


458
0:41:26,65 --> 0:41:29,489
would shake alarmingly.


459
0:41:29,489 --> 0:41:34,15
And that will look good.


460
0:41:34,15 --> 0:41:39,489
Preparations proceeded for the first of the
captive inert flights.


461
0:41:39,489 --> 0:41:45,41
This is Fitz Fulton and Tom McMurtry, both
real good friends, and they were the crew


462
0:41:45,41 --> 0:41:49,269
on the 747 for this first milestone flight.


463
0:41:49,269 --> 0:41:55,94
A lot of people were out watching and wondering
if it would fly, which it did very well.


464
0:41:55,94 --> 0:41:57,609
And off it went.


465
0:41:57,609 --> 0:42:3,109
You notice a longer front attached structure
there.


466
0:42:3,109 --> 0:42:12,19
And the orbiter is purposely on there at angle
of attack to produce lift.


467
0:42:12,19 --> 0:42:19,989
I flew a 747 for ferry flights now and to
haul orbiters back to the Cape when they land


468
0:42:19,989 --> 0:42:22,559
at Edwards, as the last one did.


469
0:42:22,559 --> 0:42:30,65
And the nose, that front bipod is much shorter
so that the orbiter is down for less drag


470
0:42:30,65 --> 0:42:33,119
for the combination.


471
0:42:33,119 --> 0:42:44,41
But this setup here was so that we could get
the orbiter off the top and not the tail.


472
0:42:44,41 --> 0:42:44,95
There is a rumble.


473
0:42:44,95 --> 0:42:46,829
The crew noticed a shaking.


474
0:42:46,829 --> 0:42:49,4
It is still the case when you fly.


475
0:42:49,4 --> 0:42:55,64
These vertical fins were added onto the horizontal
stabs to increase directional stability because


476
0:42:55,64 --> 0:42:58,4
the orbiter blanks a lot of flow over the
normal vertical.


477
0:42:58,4 --> 0:43:1,749
In fact, they overdid it a little bit.


478
0:43:1,749 --> 0:43:8,969
There is too much structural stability which
has resulted in the weird situation.


479
0:43:8,969 --> 0:43:19,99
Your cross-wind limit, when you have an orbiter
onboard, is greater than when it is not because


480
0:43:19,99 --> 0:43:21,609
you have so much directional stability and
a crosswind.


481
0:43:21,609 --> 0:43:26,509
There is a strong weathervaning and you run
out of normal rudder without an orbiter, so


482
0:43:26,509 --> 0:43:31,63
you are good only to 15 knots crosswind with
the orbiter on.


483
0:43:31,63 --> 0:43:33,729
The limit is 20 knots.


484
0:43:33,729 --> 0:43:35,109
And it is a good limit.


485
0:43:35,109 --> 0:43:37,569
I have flown them both ways in cross winds.


486
0:43:37,569 --> 0:43:42,619
And, indeed, at those numbers you run out
of rudder as you land and are rolling out.


487
0:43:42,619 --> 0:43:49,339
The strong weathervane intensity is leading
you out this side of the runway.


488
0:43:49,339 --> 0:43:50,44
Anyway, that looked good.


489
0:43:50,44 --> 0:43:55,549
And so I came back and we had a big post-flight
party.


490
0:43:55,549 --> 0:43:56,979
ALT was great for parties.


491
0:43:56,979 --> 0:43:59,99
We had 13 post-flight parties.


492
0:43:59,99 --> 0:44:11,7
And, at the same time we were doing the ALT
flights, we are developing a Shuttle training


493
0:44:11,7 --> 0:44:12,259
aircraft.


494
0:44:12,259 --> 0:44:19,279
This is Gulfstream II with big side force
generators on the belly.


495
0:44:19,279 --> 0:44:21,64
That is an airborne simulator.


496
0:44:21,64 --> 0:44:25,2
The left seat is set up with orbiter instruments.


497
0:44:25,2 --> 0:44:34,16
And the right seat was the standard gulfstream
cockpit that had flown thousands of dives


498
0:44:34,16 --> 0:44:47,549
at the ground in the SGA preparing for the
whole idea of first time for sure unpowered


499
0:44:47,549 --> 0:44:49,999
landing that you have to do right the first
time.


500
0:44:49,999 --> 0:44:58,979
And back in the simulator here for lots more
runs.


501
0:44:58,979 --> 0:45:5,15
And it was a great time because everything
was brand new, very interesting.


502
0:45:5,15 --> 0:45:8,299
This is a camera and an actual model.


503
0:45:8,299 --> 0:45:13,63
This is before the days of computer generated
video.


504
0:45:13,63 --> 0:45:16,63
It flew the little camera down to landing.


505
0:45:16,63 --> 0:45:19,869
And we learned a lot about [NOISE OBSCURES]


506
0:45:19,869 --> 0:45:21,269
characteristics.


507
0:45:21,269 --> 0:45:30,609
One that we really wondered about, when you
made a lateral input to roll the orbiter in


508
0:45:30,609 --> 0:45:32,969
the simulator, it would bang you.


509
0:45:32,969 --> 0:45:37,89
It was this lateral lurch, we call it.


510
0:45:37,89 --> 0:45:38,579
It would jolt you sideways.


511
0:45:38,579 --> 0:45:40,42
And we thought this cannot be real.


512
0:45:40,42 --> 0:45:41,13
It doesn't make any sense.


513
0:45:41,13 --> 0:45:43,569
No airplane we ever flew does that.


514
0:45:43,569 --> 0:45:45,43
We squawked it.


515
0:45:45,43 --> 0:45:51,49
They came back and said the equations are
all worked out so we live with it and thought


516
0:45:51,49 --> 0:45:57,13
it was just an artifact that snuck in there
and didn't worry about it.


517
0:45:57,13 --> 0:46:10,7
Now, the captive-active started where we actually
got in and cranked things up.


518
0:46:10,7 --> 0:46:14,369
On the second flight, I was chasing in a T-38.


519
0:46:14,369 --> 0:46:15,89
And Engle and Truly were in the cockpit.


520
0:46:15,89 --> 0:46:22,539
And I noticed a shiny look on the side.


521
0:46:22,539 --> 0:46:28,619
That big X on the CRT is what happens when
the computer that is driving that CRT quits.


522
0:46:28,619 --> 0:46:34,42
That is sort of the panic symbol when the
X shows up.


523
0:46:34,42 --> 0:46:38,91
Anyway, I noticed a leak, as it turned out
to be.


524
0:46:38,91 --> 0:46:40,93
We had that severe hydrazine leak.


525
0:46:40,93 --> 0:46:43,92
Hydrazine is bad stuff to have leaking.


526
0:46:43,92 --> 0:46:49,969
And one of the APU supply tanks let go.


527
0:46:49,969 --> 0:46:53,92
Plus, they had an over temp.


528
0:46:53,92 --> 0:46:59,819
We found things that were wrong that made
these captive flights worthwhile.


529
0:46:59,819 --> 0:47:6,93
If we had just gone and launched off on the
first one, it could have been more exciting


530
0:47:6,93 --> 0:47:10,89
than it needed to be.


531
0:47:10,89 --> 0:47:11,479
We had five of those.


532
0:47:11,479 --> 0:47:16,459
And Fred Hayes and I got the odd numbered
flights, one, three and five.


533
0:47:16,459 --> 0:47:17,869
Five more post-flight parties.


534
0:47:17,869 --> 0:47:24,469
And then we decided we were ready to go.


535
0:47:24,469 --> 0:47:27,13
Well, this is the last of the captive-active
flights.


536
0:47:27,13 --> 0:47:34,369
The scheme by which we plan to get off of
here and not take off the tail of the 747


537
0:47:34,369 --> 0:47:37,13
was that the 747 would go as high as it could
go.


538
0:47:37,13 --> 0:47:43,69
It could get up to around 27,000 feet with
engines over-boosted.


539
0:47:43,69 --> 0:47:47,829
Pratt & Whitney said you could go this long
with extra power.


540
0:47:47,829 --> 0:47:52,9
And then nose over and speed up to 240 knots.


541
0:47:52,9 --> 0:47:57,289
It was climbing maybe to 190, 200 knots.


542
0:47:57,289 --> 0:48:0,959
With a little downhill push, we got up to
240.


543
0:48:0,959 --> 0:48:11,89
At 240 the SEA pilots would go to idle power
and air brakes up to put drag on the carrier.


544
0:48:11,89 --> 0:48:19,41
At that condition of 240 knots and the angle
of attack of the orbiter, it was actually


545
0:48:19,41 --> 0:48:22,89
lifting more than its own weight.


546
0:48:22,89 --> 0:48:27,779
So the result is we really dropped the carrier,
as it turns out.


547
0:48:27,779 --> 0:48:31,199
There is three-quarters of a G difference
between the two.


548
0:48:31,199 --> 0:48:33,959
And so, we got a lot of use.


549
0:48:33,959 --> 0:48:39,109
For some reason Fred's left shoulder, he is
in the left seat and he mashed the separation


550
0:48:39,109 --> 0:48:45,479
button after Fitz on the carrier aircraft
hollered "carrier ready," that is they were


551
0:48:45,479 --> 0:48:55,309
back at idle with the speed brakes up, pushed
the go button and bang, all seven explosive


552
0:48:55,309 --> 0:48:58,509
bolts would blow.


553
0:48:58,509 --> 0:49:0,259
Control Room was in Houston, strange enough.


554
0:49:0,259 --> 0:49:7,589
We are talking to people back in the old JSC
Control Room when we are out at Edwards flying


555
0:49:7,589 --> 0:49:8,609
these flights.


556
0:49:8,609 --> 0:49:9,599
It was just like they were there.


557
0:49:9,599 --> 0:49:13,549
And we were coming up on a condition.


558
0:49:13,549 --> 0:49:17,599
And this was in August of '77.


559
0:49:17,599 --> 0:49:20,209
All the ALT flights happened in 1977.


560
0:49:20,209 --> 0:49:26,239
You notice there is a tail cone on here.


561
0:49:26,239 --> 0:49:29,17
The tail cone was flown on the first three
flights.


562
0:49:29,17 --> 0:49:32,949
That makes a big difference.


563
0:49:32,949 --> 0:49:39,749
It smoothes the flow s that the buffet on
the tail, the carrier aircraft was less, and


564
0:49:39,749 --> 0:49:43,79
it just about doubled the L/D of the orbiter.


565
0:49:43,79 --> 0:49:51,44
We are going to arm.


566
0:49:51,44 --> 0:50:4,999
And we had two chases, one off to the right
and in trail separation.


567
0:50:4,999 --> 0:50:12,839
Just like the engineer said and the load cells
that we had on there, testing exactly which


568
0:50:12,839 --> 0:50:16,65
was the thing tugging before we did it, said
we could do straight up.


569
0:50:16,65 --> 0:50:18,209
This is slow motion.


570
0:50:18,209 --> 0:50:19,18
Nothing is leaking.


571
0:50:19,18 --> 0:50:27,839
The vortex is out at the wing tips causing
condensation and away we went.


572
0:50:27,839 --> 0:50:32,91
And simultaneous with this bang that shutters
through the airplane with all these explosive


573
0:50:32,91 --> 0:50:39,319
volts a big X on the CRT in front of me.


574
0:50:39,319 --> 0:50:44,41
We had cue cards and we had practiced this.


575
0:50:44,41 --> 0:50:53,64
My job, while Fred flew, he actually got a
vertical clear from this chase pilot and then


576
0:50:53,64 --> 0:50:58,65
rolled into a bank and a lateral clear from
the guy that was chasing from behind and knew


577
0:50:58,65 --> 0:51:0,199
that it was OK to push over.


578
0:51:0,199 --> 0:51:4,259
Because we are only now at 200 knots and we
wanted to get to 300.


579
0:51:4,259 --> 0:51:9,859
And it took a considerable pushover to get
up to speed.


580
0:51:9,859 --> 0:51:14,779
Meanwhile, I am pulling circuit breakers on
rate gyros and turning off accelerometers


581
0:51:14,779 --> 0:51:25,299
at our preplanned procedure to accommodate
flaws in the redundancy management.


582
0:51:25,299 --> 0:51:31,279
When you lose one computer you also take out
part of the sensors in the flight control


583
0:51:31,279 --> 0:51:31,449
system.


584
0:51:31,449 --> 0:51:36,66
And, to be sure that a subsequent failure
wouldn't put you in worse shape, it took about


585
0:51:36,66 --> 0:51:39,65
a minute's worth of manual reconfiguration
on my part.


586
0:51:39,65 --> 0:51:42,109
And I kind of missed the whole first part
of the flight.


587
0:51:42,109 --> 0:51:46,559
When I turned around I realized hey, this
thing is flying good, it is smooth and is


588
0:51:46,559 --> 0:51:47,819
on speed.


589
0:51:47,819 --> 0:51:49,789
And Fred was flying.


590
0:51:49,789 --> 0:51:55,349
We flew a rectangular pattern out of a downwind
leg here as we nosed over.


591
0:51:55,349 --> 0:52:1,199
And I got my chance to roll into a left 90
degree turn and fly base leg.


592
0:52:1,199 --> 0:52:7,9
And, as I put the stick over to roll, we got
this big lateral arch just like the simulator


593
0:52:7,9 --> 0:52:10,9
said.


594
0:52:10,9 --> 0:52:11,559
It just stunned me.


595
0:52:11,559 --> 0:52:13,869
Son of a gun, they were right after all.


596
0:52:13,869 --> 0:52:21,18
It was just the nature of something flying
at high alpha and rotating about a stability


597
0:52:21,18 --> 0:52:23,759
axis and the cockpit gets slid sideways.


598
0:52:23,759 --> 0:52:26,89
It has big elevons so it flies like a fighter.


599
0:52:26,89 --> 0:52:27,299
It really does.


600
0:52:27,299 --> 0:52:31,279
And you are doing it all with a little stick
that doesn't move much.


601
0:52:31,279 --> 0:52:38,219
Anyway, we came down final at 290, I think
it was, flared out.


602
0:52:38,219 --> 0:52:40,89
My job was to put the gear down, a critical
function.


603
0:52:40,89 --> 0:52:50,469
And we are landing on lakebed 1-7 on the dry
lake at Edwards which is something like ten


604
0:52:50,469 --> 0:52:54,509
miles long, so we have pretty good margins
there.


605
0:52:54,509 --> 0:53:0,44
And Fred took the airplane back from ALT and
I got to fly base leg.


606
0:53:0,44 --> 0:53:6,299
But we touched down at about 185, I think
it was, nice and smooth.


607
0:53:6,299 --> 0:53:7,49
It was beautiful.


608
0:53:7,49 --> 0:53:16,489
The speed brake comes out to help cushion
the de-rotation, nose gear down and he raised


609
0:53:16,489 --> 0:53:18,18
a little dust as he rolled to a stop.


610
0:53:18,18 --> 0:53:20,17
So it was a good day.


611
0:53:20,17 --> 0:53:28,699
Now, we had a really good post-flight party
after this one.


612
0:53:28,699 --> 0:53:39,219
And see the rudder speed brake flared there
and the elevons fold up.


613
0:53:39,219 --> 0:53:43,239
And so, now Fred truly did it again.


614
0:53:43,239 --> 0:53:56,42
A couple weeks later or thereabouts they got
their turn and they did much the same flight,


615
0:53:56,42 --> 0:53:57,59
repeated it.


616
0:53:57,59 --> 0:54:0,369
Oh, one thing.


617
0:54:0,369 --> 0:54:3,63
You see the Pitot boom out there.


618
0:54:3,63 --> 0:54:7,91
The Pitot boom is strictly on the Enterprise,
put out there to get good air data out in


619
0:54:7,91 --> 0:54:14,249
front of this big blivit of an airplane which
is hard to get good measurements.


620
0:54:14,249 --> 0:54:30,369
Let me get the next one going here, if I can
figure out how to get out of this.


621
0:54:30,369 --> 0:54:32,319
The excitement came later.


622
0:54:32,319 --> 0:54:49,319
On STS-1, I looked out there when were on
final, I had to look out and look at the Pitot


623
0:54:49,319 --> 0:54:54,829
boom, and it is going through an arch of about
three feet.


624
0:54:54,829 --> 0:54:59,189
It was built with the perfect resonance of
everything else with the airplane, and it


625
0:54:59,189 --> 0:55:2,209
was just a blur out there going back and forth.


626
0:55:2,209 --> 0:55:4,759
And I really thought it was going to break
off.


627
0:55:4,759 --> 0:55:13,689
Was that your only Pitot source or did you
have the normal ones [OVERLAPPING VOICES]?


628
0:55:13,689 --> 0:55:15,92
Good question.


629
0:55:15,92 --> 0:55:18,269
Somehow we had at least inertially derived
ones.


630
0:55:18,269 --> 0:55:20,469
Everything looked good.


631
0:55:20,469 --> 0:55:24,279
And, actually, it still put out good airspeed,
even though it was a blur.


632
0:55:24,279 --> 0:55:26,759
And I think the beta averaged out.


633
0:55:26,759 --> 0:55:35,459
Anyway, it wasn't a problem we noticed other
than visually it looked like it was going


634
0:55:35,459 --> 0:55:36,469
to break off.


635
0:55:36,469 --> 0:55:40,969
They changed and stiffened it up so it wasn't
a problem on subsequent flights.


636
0:55:40,969 --> 0:55:47,92
Now, you can see here we are at free flight
four now which was the other crew's turn.


637
0:55:47,92 --> 0:55:59,569
The tail cone is off and our final pressure
glide slope with the tail cone on was 11 degrees.


638
0:55:59,569 --> 0:56:5,449
With tail cone off it was 23 degrees, halves
your L/D.


639
0:56:5,449 --> 0:56:11,189
So you really are in a steep dive.


640
0:56:11,189 --> 0:56:20,739
Normal ILS into Logan out here would be 2.5
degrees so you are coming down gangbusters.


641
0:56:20,739 --> 0:56:27,91
And it is even worse in ALT than it was in
the orbital missions which were coming down


642
0:56:27,91 --> 0:56:30,439
with the same configuration but much heavier.


643
0:56:30,439 --> 0:56:33,989
Heavier you've got more gravity working for
you and you can fly shallower.


644
0:56:33,989 --> 0:56:36,339
It doesn't seem to figure, but that is the
way it is.


645
0:56:36,339 --> 0:56:41,289
So 19 degrees is a normal return from orbit.


646
0:56:41,289 --> 0:56:44,67
Final pressure glide slope we were up in the
20s.


647
0:56:44,67 --> 0:56:51,9
Kind of catching up a little.


648
0:56:51,9 --> 0:56:57,18
One of our jobs on the flight preceding this
was to try the braking.


649
0:56:57,18 --> 0:57:0,17
We just let it roll out on the first couple
flights.


650
0:57:0,17 --> 0:57:2,829
They wanted to do brake tests.


651
0:57:2,829 --> 0:57:8,969
And Fred jumped on the brakes after we touched
down and another resonance problem, interaction


652
0:57:8,969 --> 0:57:19,339
between the structure and the anti-skid, and
I thought it was going to break the airplane.


653
0:57:19,339 --> 0:57:24,749
It was just violent shuttering, shaking, everything
rattling in the cockpit.


654
0:57:24,749 --> 0:57:27,93
And I hollered to Fred, get off the brakes,
we are going to brake something.


655
0:57:27,93 --> 0:57:30,91
He said no, the card says we have got to do
max braking.


656
0:57:30,91 --> 0:57:33,969
I was pleading with him to get off the brakes,
which he did.


657
0:57:33,969 --> 0:57:34,9
Easy fix.


658
0:57:34,9 --> 0:57:40,109
When they flew the next flight here they did
hard braking, and it was smooth.


659
0:57:40,109 --> 0:57:47,14
They went in to change the resister and the
feedback electrons, and that did it.


660
0:57:47,14 --> 0:57:50,549
I mean it was instant fix.


661
0:57:50,549 --> 0:58:2,519
So there still is reason to do flight tests
because surprises happen.


662
0:58:2,519 --> 0:58:9,529
Now free flight five, it turns out there was
a little brake here.


663
0:58:9,529 --> 0:58:17,459
We are back at Houston and Prince Charles,
who wasn't married yet at that time, came


664
0:58:17,459 --> 0:58:19,299
by on a visit.


665
0:58:19,299 --> 0:58:24,92
And we gave him a ride in the simulator.


666
0:58:24,92 --> 0:58:26,209
He had some flying time.


667
0:58:26,209 --> 0:58:28,819
And he got into a horrendous PIO.


668
0:58:28,819 --> 0:58:33,38
I mean he was out of control and crashed in
the simulator.


669
0:58:33,38 --> 0:58:34,229
And felt bad.


670
0:58:34,229 --> 0:58:37,109
And we said that is because you're not used
to the stick and everything.


671
0:58:37,109 --> 0:58:38,299
And that was his tour.


672
0:58:38,299 --> 0:58:43,39
Now, for this flight, he was actually out
along the runway.


673
0:58:43,39 --> 0:58:46,859
They had him out there so he could watch.


674
0:58:46,859 --> 0:58:51,15
The objective here was to land on the concrete
runway, put it right on the line, there is


675
0:58:51,15 --> 0:58:57,869
a white line 5,000 feet down, and Fred was
really working at it, putting in a lot of


676
0:58:57,869 --> 0:58:57,869
inputs.


677
0:58:57,869 --> 0:58:59,749
Look at the elevons going there.


678
0:58:59,749 --> 0:59:2,17
You see them?


679
0:59:2,17 --> 0:59:6,88
And he is making roll commands.


680
0:59:6,88 --> 0:59:16,349
And so we logged a couple landings.


681
0:59:16,349 --> 0:59:24,209
And down and rolled to a stop.


682
0:59:24,209 --> 0:59:26,849
Afterwards, we called out and he came up to
say hello.


683
0:59:26,849 --> 0:59:28,15
He said oh, you made me feel good.


684
0:59:28,15 --> 0:59:31,69
You guys did as bad as I did.


685
0:59:31,69 --> 0:59:35,849
There he is right there with his binoculars.


686
0:59:35,849 --> 0:59:38,199
Well, that scared everybody to death.


687
0:59:38,199 --> 0:59:40,769
It looked worse from outside than it did in
the cockpit.


688
0:59:40,769 --> 0:59:45,199
And the flight control flaw that we found,
though, was serious.


689
0:59:45,199 --> 0:59:50,39
You've got elevons that do both pitch and
roll.


690
0:59:50,39 --> 0:59:54,829
So, in the software, when you are asking for
both pitch and roll at the same time, it has


691
0:59:54,829 --> 0:59:58,819
got to decide which one do I move?


692
0:59:58,819 --> 1:0:8,9
This is just a supposition of what would come.


693
1:0:8,9 --> 1:0:10,549
The software had to give priority.


694
1:0:10,549 --> 1:0:13,63
And they decided to give priority to pitch.


695
1:0:13,63 --> 1:0:22,39
And roll was taken second priority when you
had to limit the commands to the elevons to


696
1:0:22,39 --> 1:0:27,329
within the capability of the hydraulic system.


697
1:0:27,329 --> 1:0:32,689
The result was a lag in roll response when
you are working pitch hard.


698
1:0:32,689 --> 1:0:36,549
And the lag was up around two-tenths to three-tenths
of a second.


699
1:0:36,549 --> 1:0:40,539
You may be aware if you studied flight control
systems.


700
1:0:40,539 --> 1:0:50,949
Any kind of system that has a quarter second
delay between input and response is asking


701
1:0:50,949 --> 1:0:55,239
for a PIO, Pilot Induced Oscillation.


702
1:0:55,239 --> 1:0:57,4
And we had a big time in roll.


703
1:0:57,4 --> 1:1:1,529
Fred was clanking back and forth to stop and
roll trying to level the wings out there that


704
1:1:1,529 --> 1:1:2,749
first skip.


705
1:1:2,749 --> 1:1:6,759
I heard the controller banging over there.


706
1:1:6,759 --> 1:1:10,42
And I suggested if you get off maybe it will
damp.


707
1:1:10,42 --> 1:1:15,119
We're doing this and, sure enough, that is
what he did.


708
1:1:15,119 --> 1:1:21,15
He stopped the inputs, the airplane damped
right away and then it went OK.


709
1:1:21,15 --> 1:1:30,869
But it was something we had to fix, obviously.


710
1:1:30,869 --> 1:1:40,89
Here is a picture just a micro-second after
liftoff on one of the last two.


711
1:1:40,89 --> 1:1:46,549
Well, there was a decision with a lot of debate
about do we go back and fix the flight control


712
1:1:46,549 --> 1:1:48,199
and fly some more ALT?


713
1:1:48,199 --> 1:1:52,289
But this is a huge production and it was costing
time and we weren't getting into orbit.


714
1:1:52,289 --> 1:1:58,869
A decision was made now we will do it in simulators
and in-flight simulators and fix the problem,


715
1:1:58,869 --> 1:1:59,819
but press on.


716
1:1:59,819 --> 1:2:4,479
That was the end of ALT, at the end of which,
when you do flight tests, you talk about opening


717
1:2:4,479 --> 1:2:5,819
the envelope of an airplane.


718
1:2:5,819 --> 1:2:12,279
Well, the envelope of the Space Shuttle is
400 nautical miles altitude and mach 25.


719
1:2:12,279 --> 1:2:16,69
And in ALT we got the four miles and 0.3 mach.


720
1:2:16,69 --> 1:2:23,299
It is really down in the lower left corner,
but worth doing.


721
1:2:23,299 --> 1:2:25,729
Test results.


722
1:2:25,729 --> 1:2:28,779
I mentioned as we went we had that APU fuel
leak.


723
1:2:28,779 --> 1:2:29,429
Fixed it.


724
1:2:29,429 --> 1:2:32,99
Didn't come back.


725
1:2:32,99 --> 1:2:37,9
The buffet lifter drag was right on what we
expected, no surprises there.


726
1:2:37,9 --> 1:2:40,619
Handling qualities were good, even with the
lurch.


727
1:2:40,619 --> 1:2:43,15
It was not a problem.


728
1:2:43,15 --> 1:2:46,67
I mentioned the Pitot boom, the anti-skid.


729
1:2:46,67 --> 1:2:51,15
SCA did the job, although it struggled to
get up.


730
1:2:51,15 --> 1:2:55,689
With the tail coming off, it could only get
to about 18,000 feet.


731
1:2:55,689 --> 1:3:0,67
So this was not a good program to build up
your flying time.


732
1:3:0,67 --> 1:3:9,63
It was about a total, in three flights, of
about 12 minutes of flying time.


733
1:3:9,63 --> 1:3:18,16
And the biggie I mentioned was the handling
qualities and the PIO tendency that we fixed


734
1:3:18,16 --> 1:3:25,16
with lots of studies later and changes in
the way the control equations were written.


735
1:3:25,16 --> 1:3:30,369
And, as a final thing, they did some more
flights with the nose lowered down and determine


736
1:3:30,369 --> 1:3:34,789
what the ferry flight performance of the combination
is.


737
1:3:34,789 --> 1:3:41,439
I, later after flying in space, checked out
on the 747 and still fly it on the ferry flights.


738
1:3:41,439 --> 1:3:44,559
And it does the job.


739
1:3:44,559 --> 1:3:46,89
It burns lots of gas.


740
1:3:46,89 --> 1:3:56,549
I figured out that the combination across
the country, the mileage is about 300 feet


741
1:3:56,549 --> 1:4:0,549
per gallon, so a football field per gallon
of fuel.


742
1:4:0,549 --> 1:4:4,519
40,000 pounds an hour is the field flow.


743
1:4:4,519 --> 1:4:15,59
It goes about 1.5 times its own length when
we get on the gas, but it gets there.


744
1:4:15,59 --> 1:4:17,819
I don't have to buy the fuel.


745
1:4:17,819 --> 1:4:20,979
A lot of people said wasn't this scary, ALT?


746
1:4:20,979 --> 1:4:25,609
Actually, from a risk standpoint, we had ejection
seats.


747
1:4:25,609 --> 1:4:31,709
If anything had gone wrong, anywhere along
the line, we could have pulled the handle


748
1:4:31,709 --> 1:4:33,14
and jumped out.


749
1:4:33,14 --> 1:4:39,66
The scariest part of it was when we got in,
and during the captive flights, we would just


750
1:4:39,66 --> 1:4:41,959
walk up a stairway and crawl through the hatch.


751
1:4:41,959 --> 1:4:43,38
And the same way getting out.


752
1:4:43,38 --> 1:4:52,979
But after the captive active flights, we would
land still on the orbiter.


753
1:4:52,979 --> 1:4:56,849
And they had this cherry picker to get us
out.


754
1:4:56,849 --> 1:5:0,89
Now, the situation here is it's a round hatch
hedged at the bottom.


755
1:5:0,89 --> 1:5:7,769
They only wanted on person at a time on the
end of this thing.


756
1:5:7,769 --> 1:5:13,849
You open a round hatch and then they bring
this up, the guy on the ground.


757
1:5:13,849 --> 1:5:19,41
And he doesn't want to get too close and ding
so he leaves about this much of a gap from


758
1:5:19,41 --> 1:5:24,67
this round hatch which is 60 feet above the
ground that you have got to crawl out on your


759
1:5:24,67 --> 1:5:31,929
knees, then stand up and then make the leap
across the thing onto this wobbly cage up


760
1:5:31,929 --> 1:5:32,88
there.


761
1:5:32,88 --> 1:5:37,519
That is how our captive actives went.


762
1:5:37,519 --> 1:5:44,999
Where you wearing flight suits for all these
tests?


763
1:5:44,999 --> 1:5:52,509
Yeah, we were wearing flight suits and helmets
like you would in a 518 or any fighter.


764
1:5:52,509 --> 1:5:53,219
Not pressure suits.


765
1:5:53,219 --> 1:6:2,219
We didn't have a severe cabin pressure risk
at 25,000 feet.


766
1:6:2,219 --> 1:6:8,719
Let me get into the full screen mode here.


767
1:6:8,719 --> 1:6:15,49
I put in some thoughts about what is different
when you test an aircraft versus a spacecraft.


768
1:6:15,49 --> 1:6:18,589
With an airplane you can do little baby steps,
incremental tests.


769
1:6:18,589 --> 1:6:24,699
You can do static runs of the propulsion up
to the full power in the airplane itself.


770
1:6:24,699 --> 1:6:28,42
Then you taxi it slow and then faster and
faster down the runway.


771
1:6:28,42 --> 1:6:31,739
You can rotate the nose a little bit.


772
1:6:31,739 --> 1:6:36,729
The first flight you will fly slow and leave
the gear down and then land it soon and check


773
1:6:36,729 --> 1:6:37,249
everything.


774
1:6:37,249 --> 1:6:40,49
And you could hold off for a perfect day to
do it.


775
1:6:40,49 --> 1:6:44,179
And then you go faster and faster to expand
the envelope.


776
1:6:44,179 --> 1:6:50,289
If anything goes wrong you can peel off and
get back on the ground quick.


777
1:6:50,289 --> 1:6:55,579
And, as I mentioned, you can always pull the
handle and bail out if things go really bad.


778
1:6:55,579 --> 1:7:1,299
When you have a spacecraft it is all or nothing.


779
1:7:1,299 --> 1:7:5,88
You have got to use the propulsion at its
full power.


780
1:7:5,88 --> 1:7:11,789
All the critical systems and subsystems have
got to work.


781
1:7:11,789 --> 1:7:14,819
You cannot make a quick abort.


782
1:7:14,819 --> 1:7:19,39
Long delays like days are sometimes required
to get back to the conditions where you can


783
1:7:19,39 --> 1:7:21,459
make an appropriate landing.


784
1:7:21,459 --> 1:7:27,789
And the weather could turn sour at the time.


785
1:7:27,789 --> 1:7:34,42
When you are going to flight test the spacecraft
you have got to have a lot of redundancy in


786
1:7:34,42 --> 1:7:41,509
the design to allow for the bad day that has
to carry it through in a considerable amount


787
1:7:41,509 --> 1:7:41,91
of time.


788
1:7:41,91 --> 1:7:50,819
You necessarily have got to test everything
to the limit, wind tunnels, CVD, thermal vacuum


789
1:7:50,819 --> 1:7:54,479
because the environment is lots more stressful.


790
1:7:54,479 --> 1:7:59,359
You have got to have a lot of instrumentation
so that you can tell what did go wrong or


791
1:7:59,359 --> 1:8:0,789
be sure that everything went right.


792
1:8:0,789 --> 1:8:8,839
You are talking about an army of controllers
in a control room to pull it off with a complex


793
1:8:8,839 --> 1:8:10,359
system like the Shuttle.


794
1:8:10,359 --> 1:8:14,38
And lots of simulation to get everybody trained.


795
1:8:14,38 --> 1:8:16,31
A biggie is to verify the software.


796
1:8:16,31 --> 1:8:22,12
I mentioned the software is guaranteed to
be wrong on the first release and several


797
1:8:22,12 --> 1:8:22,73
subsequent.


798
1:8:22,73 --> 1:8:27,6
It is just the nature of building software.


799
1:8:27,6 --> 1:8:32,9
And so getting that checked out is a major
one.


800
1:8:32,9 --> 1:8:33,4
Procedures.


801
1:8:33,4 --> 1:8:44,46
When we flew the orbital flight, the stack
of checklists just laid on top of each other


802
1:8:44,46 --> 1:8:49,109
was about this high, for 51F, and it weighed
210 pounds.


803
1:8:49,109 --> 1:8:55,6
It was called the Flight Data File.


804
1:8:55,6 --> 1:9:3,94
And then lots of time and expense getting
everybody really ready to go.


805
1:9:3,94 --> 1:9:10,549
And being sure that when you're going into
an unknown part of the envelope that the margins


806
1:9:10,549 --> 1:9:12,28
on the flight control are adequate.


807
1:9:12,28 --> 1:9:17,98
So the surprises and the aeroderivatives that
hit you can be accommodating.


808
1:9:17,98 --> 1:9:22,83
I have rambled on a long time here.


809
1:9:22,83 --> 1:9:27,21
We can take the five-minute break, I can answer
questions, however you want to do it.


810
1:9:27,21 --> 1:9:28,56
Maybe it's time for a stretch.


811
1:9:28,56 --> 1:9:32,53
Let's do a two-minute break.


812
1:9:32,53 --> 1:9:36,359
These people are tough.


813
1:9:36,359 --> 1:9:38,28
All right.


814
1:9:38,28 --> 1:9:40,2
Break is over.


815
1:9:40,2 --> 1:9:58,31
The next assignment for me was being put on
an orbital flight test, and specifically STS-3.


816
1:9:58,31 --> 1:10:11,98
A two man crew, Jack Lousma, a Marine, and
myself from the Air Force, we were in pressure


817
1:10:11,98 --> 1:10:16,22
suits, you will notice there, and on ejection
seats in the Columbia.


818
1:10:16,22 --> 1:10:19,1
This is OV-102.


819
1:10:19,1 --> 1:10:22,18
101 was the Enterprise.


820
1:10:22,18 --> 1:10:24,63
102 was the Columbia.


821
1:10:24,63 --> 1:10:28,17
And our countdown went smoothly.


822
1:10:28,17 --> 1:10:30,21
This was in March of '82.


823
1:10:30,21 --> 1:10:37,29
And this is a signature moment in your life
when the SRBs light.


824
1:10:37,29 --> 1:10:46,4
I mean it looks smooth and nice as we are
flying through a cloud here on launch, logging


825
1:10:46,4 --> 1:10:57,58
weather time I might add, but it is rough
and noisy and rattley.


826
1:10:57,58 --> 1:11:3,9
And the acceleration is right away, and it
builds up to 3Gs.


827
1:11:3,9 --> 1:11:6,2
When the main engines are throttled back,
the whole 3Gs.


828
1:11:6,2 --> 1:11:10,67
And so, it is no doubt you are on your way
somewhere really fast wherever the solids


829
1:11:10,67 --> 1:11:14,2
want to go.


830
1:11:14,2 --> 1:11:17,4
Everything worked good right up to MECO.


831
1:11:17,4 --> 1:11:20,51
And the external tank, as you saw, drifted
away.


832
1:11:20,51 --> 1:11:28,96
And then here come the first order of business,
opening the payload bay doors so we can start


833
1:11:28,96 --> 1:11:33,24
rejecting heat with the radiators that are
mounted on the inside.


834
1:11:33,24 --> 1:11:35,44
We are tailed down.


835
1:11:35,44 --> 1:11:41,77
And as you watch here, we are going right
over Los Angeles at the time.


836
1:11:41,77 --> 1:11:43,48
This is just north of LA.


837
1:11:43,48 --> 1:11:47,92
You can see LA.


838
1:11:47,92 --> 1:12:2,37
Sorry, this is Santa Monica, LAX and 
Palos Verdes right there.


839
1:12:2,37 --> 1:12:9,62
Anyway, the first thing we had to do is get
out of Theodolite, that is a sighting device


840
1:12:9,62 --> 1:12:19,75
that surveyors use, and take a daunting number
of readings on little targets that were pasted


841
1:12:19,75 --> 1:12:23,98
around inside the payload bay and on the doors
to measure where they were.


842
1:12:23,98 --> 1:12:27,2
And we did that through the flight all the
way along.


843
1:12:27,2 --> 1:12:30,31
It wasn't fast enough.


844
1:12:30,31 --> 1:12:32,8
Out in front of the nose there were some dark
patches.


845
1:12:32,8 --> 1:12:36,47
That is where tile were, white tile, and fell
off during launch.


846
1:12:36,47 --> 1:12:38,35
They actually found some washed up on the
beach.


847
1:12:38,35 --> 1:12:44,87
Fortunately, none of the black tile on the
bottom fell off but we did lose some on the


848
1:12:44,87 --> 1:12:44,87
top.


849
1:12:44,87 --> 1:12:51,49
Zero G is really one of the delights.


850
1:12:51,49 --> 1:12:59,1
There are two really good things about flying
in orbit, weightlessness and the view out


851
1:12:59,1 --> 1:12:59,33
the window.


852
1:12:59,33 --> 1:13:6,88
And that is like nothing that you experience,
even flying high-performance airplanes.


853
1:13:6,88 --> 1:13:9,81
We had the RMS cranked up.


854
1:13:9,81 --> 1:13:12,21
That was my job as RMS operator.


855
1:13:12,21 --> 1:13:18,46
And we had a package in the back, the plasma
diagnostic package to grab and move out there.


856
1:13:18,46 --> 1:13:20,94
There are some things that show you the housekeeping
area.


857
1:13:20,94 --> 1:13:31,29
In the corner there is the john.


858
1:13:31,29 --> 1:13:34,25
And long duration spaceflight exercise is
important.


859
1:13:34,25 --> 1:13:39,4
It is really not a big deal on a seven-day
flight.


860
1:13:39,4 --> 1:13:47,38
Jack is a Marine, as I mentioned.


861
1:13:47,38 --> 1:13:51,61
He has got to have his daily ration of pushups,
so here we go.


862
1:13:51,61 --> 1:13:54,21
How about a one-handed pushup, Jack?


863
1:13:54,21 --> 1:14:7,9
How about a no-handed pushup?


864
1:14:7,9 --> 1:14:9,13
This is a quick summary.


865
1:14:9,13 --> 1:14:11,61
We went our seven days.


866
1:14:11,61 --> 1:14:18,57
And the lakebed at Edwards, they had a really
wet spring, was unusable, so we went to White


867
1:14:18,57 --> 1:14:20,58
Sands, New Mexico.


868
1:14:20,58 --> 1:14:28,48
The first day, right as we are about to light
the OMS engines to start deorbit, they said


869
1:14:28,48 --> 1:14:32,75
hold off because this terrible dust storm
is going on.


870
1:14:32,75 --> 1:14:40,63
And then we waited a delightful day with nothing
in the flight plane much to enjoy ourselves,


871
1:14:40,63 --> 1:14:42,25
and then came down the next day.


872
1:14:42,25 --> 1:14:49,85
Now we find another gotcha in handling quantities
here.


873
1:14:49,85 --> 1:14:54,4
Right here Jack thought the nose might be
coming down too fast and tried to stop it,


874
1:14:54,4 --> 1:14:58,8
and ended up doing a little wheelie.


875
1:14:58,8 --> 1:15:3,4
Subsequent analysis showed that the whole
response of the vehicle changes when you are


876
1:15:3,4 --> 1:15:5,79
down on the main gear only.


877
1:15:5,79 --> 1:15:7,63
And nobody thought of that.


878
1:15:7,63 --> 1:15:16,92
It would seem like, well, they are worried
about pitch in the air but not while you are


879
1:15:16,92 --> 1:15:18,65
rolling on the main gear trying to de-rotate.


880
1:15:18,65 --> 1:15:21,92
So it resulted in more software changes.


881
1:15:21,92 --> 1:15:31,25
Another thing we learned, they were pushing
for auto-land.


882
1:15:31,25 --> 1:15:36,53
We flew the whole turn onto final and down
final hands off in auto-land.


883
1:15:36,53 --> 1:15:45,73
The program wanted to take this out of the
hands of the crew, so here on the third flight


884
1:15:45,73 --> 1:15:49,94
they had us sitting there watching the airplane
fly down to pre-flare.


885
1:15:49,94 --> 1:15:55,21
And then the first chance Jack got to grab
the stick was at the last minute to do the


886
1:15:55,21 --> 1:15:57,23
flare and landing.


887
1:15:57,23 --> 1:15:59,41
And that was dumb when you look back, really
dumb.


888
1:15:59,41 --> 1:16:7,2
And so, now all flight commanders, if it has
been auto down to 40,000 feet where you go


889
1:16:7,2 --> 1:16:11,15
subsonic, we will fly manually all the way
down to get a feel for the airplane.


890
1:16:11,15 --> 1:16:13,63
It makes a lot more sense.


891
1:16:13,63 --> 1:16:14,87
That is the way flights are done now.


892
1:16:14,87 --> 1:16:18,37
Here is where we started from orbit.


893
1:16:18,37 --> 1:16:21,85
This is how Cape Canaveral looks.


894
1:16:21,85 --> 1:16:24,46
Right here is the shuttle landing strip that
is down there.


895
1:16:24,46 --> 1:16:25,34
You can see it.


896
1:16:25,34 --> 1:16:28,85
And the launch pads are these two dots.


897
1:16:28,85 --> 1:16:34,49
And so, that is where usually a shuttle flight
starts and ends.


898
1:16:34,49 --> 1:16:37,21
Here is a picture of our payload bay on STS-3.


899
1:16:37,21 --> 1:16:40,22
And we did have a payload.


900
1:16:40,22 --> 1:16:48,46
Previous crews had pretty much empty payload
bay, but we had an environmental measurement


901
1:16:48,46 --> 1:16:51,67
thing, a lot of instrumentation.


902
1:16:51,67 --> 1:16:59,2
Then this PDP, Plasma Diagnostic Package that
we actually had something to grab with the


903
1:16:59,2 --> 1:17:0,63
manipulator arm, as you see here.


904
1:17:0,63 --> 1:17:8,15
I looked around and found, I don't know if
you can recognize this, but that is Cape Cod


905
1:17:8,15 --> 1:17:8,32
back there.


906
1:17:8,32 --> 1:17:13,12
A picture of MIT.


907
1:17:13,12 --> 1:17:14,18
Not a good picture.


908
1:17:14,18 --> 1:17:16,13
There have got to be lots of better ones.


909
1:17:16,13 --> 1:17:22,16
And here is where we ended up, the White Sands
area near Alamogordo, New Mexico.


910
1:17:22,16 --> 1:17:31,13
What we learned, this is a pretty cryptic
summary.


911
1:17:31,13 --> 1:17:33,19
Training was a real problem.


912
1:17:33,19 --> 1:17:43,97
The first two crews that flew STS-1 and STS-2
had all the attention of the training people


913
1:17:43,97 --> 1:17:44,97
in the simulators.


914
1:17:44,97 --> 1:17:48,3
They had priority, properly so.


915
1:17:48,3 --> 1:17:55,23
We, on the third flight, had low priority
and really struggled.


916
1:17:55,23 --> 1:18:0,35
And what we found, when we got in the simulators,
is when they didn't work right nobody could


917
1:18:0,35 --> 1:18:3,54
explain why.


918
1:18:3,54 --> 1:18:6,84
Many times we try on ascent and crash and
burn.


919
1:18:6,84 --> 1:18:9,13
And you always were scratching your head is
this real?


920
1:18:9,13 --> 1:18:12,94
Is this the way the orbiter flies or is it
some flaw in the simulator?


921
1:18:12,94 --> 1:18:20,95
Early on you are developing not only the orbiter
but the training facilities.


922
1:18:20,95 --> 1:18:22,85
And the people didn't understand the system.


923
1:18:22,85 --> 1:18:28,64
We had more exposure from ALT to subsystems
than the people that were supposed to be the


924
1:18:28,64 --> 1:18:29,4
experts.


925
1:18:29,4 --> 1:18:36,52
It was a group learning process and a long
way from what happens now when crews go in.


926
1:18:36,52 --> 1:18:40,31
And they get the straight word right from
the beginning on how things are.


927
1:18:40,31 --> 1:18:43,21
The tiles fell off.


928
1:18:43,21 --> 1:18:43,85
Not good.


929
1:18:43,85 --> 1:18:52,26
They changed the bonding scheme, improved
the quality control and, fortunately for the


930
1:18:52,26 --> 1:18:55,61
program, no critical tiles fell off.


931
1:18:55,61 --> 1:18:57,9
But that was alarming.


932
1:18:57,9 --> 1:19:4,42
We looked out there, we reported it, took
pictures of it looking at these gaps in the


933
1:19:4,42 --> 1:19:6,67
system right out in front of the windshield.


934
1:19:6,67 --> 1:19:13,79
But Ground said don't worry, that is a cool
area during entry.


935
1:19:13,79 --> 1:19:18,71
Entry is at 40 degrees angle of attack so
it is cool on top.


936
1:19:18,71 --> 1:19:19,41
They were right.


937
1:19:19,41 --> 1:19:23,9
Everything was fine.


938
1:19:23,9 --> 1:19:29,29
Another tile thing was after the flight, actually,
delay that.


939
1:19:29,29 --> 1:19:32,35
It was really more after the next flight.


940
1:19:32,35 --> 1:19:36,8
I mentioned how the ride is.


941
1:19:36,8 --> 1:19:40,1
The first two minutes were rough and exciting.


942
1:19:40,1 --> 1:19:49,38
The next six or seven are unbelievably smooth
when you get on the main engines, and then


943
1:19:49,38 --> 1:19:52,46
more vibration that you are getting sitting
in the chairs now.


944
1:19:52,46 --> 1:19:54,48
And it is just a steady relentless push.


945
1:19:54,48 --> 1:19:58,31
It is just a spectacular right.


946
1:19:58,31 --> 1:20:3,3
But you are back in the seat.


947
1:20:3,3 --> 1:20:9,63
Had an APU oil overheat during that 3G part.


948
1:20:9,63 --> 1:20:15,46
Actually, about two minutes before MECO, Ground
called and said we needed to shut down one


949
1:20:15,46 --> 1:20:15,91
APU.


950
1:20:15,91 --> 1:20:21,27
We were up past the point where we could live
without all three APUs running.


951
1:20:21,27 --> 1:20:28,46
I had a chance to test what I worked on years
previously with the cockpit design.


952
1:20:28,46 --> 1:20:35,29
You are concerned about visibility when you
are squashed in the seat at 3Gs and access.


953
1:20:35,29 --> 1:20:40,36
And the APU switches, we had to put them down
here.


954
1:20:40,36 --> 1:20:48,19
And, I remember worrying specifically, if
we have got to get to the APU switches, the


955
1:20:48,19 --> 1:20:52,92
guy on the right seat under 3Gs, can he lift
the helmet and look over there and find the


956
1:20:52,92 --> 1:20:53,69
correct switch?


957
1:20:53,69 --> 1:20:58,38
And you do not want to shut down the wrong
one, one of the good ones.


958
1:20:58,38 --> 1:21:8,0
And it turned out, I guess with the adrenaline
lifting this heavy helmet at 3Gs, I did it


959
1:21:8,0 --> 1:21:10,28
without even thinking about it and went right
to the switch.


960
1:21:10,28 --> 1:21:17,19
So it worked.


961
1:21:17,19 --> 1:21:19,92
General habitability was good in the orbiter.


962
1:21:19,92 --> 1:21:26,6
The first time anybody lived there for eight
days.


963
1:21:26,6 --> 1:21:30,31
A good way to think about living in the orbiter,
think of it as a camping trip.


964
1:21:30,31 --> 1:21:37,93
You go on a camping trip you don't worry about
hot water, showers and all the niceties of


965
1:21:37,93 --> 1:21:39,2
home.


966
1:21:39,2 --> 1:21:41,24
You get in that frame of mind and it is fine.


967
1:21:41,24 --> 1:21:51,47
The food is adequate, the facilities are OK,
although in our case the toilet ground to


968
1:21:51,47 --> 1:21:52,74
a halt.


969
1:21:52,74 --> 1:22:0,83
It is a drum that rotates to centrifugally
sling all fecal material out and contain it.


970
1:22:0,83 --> 1:22:2,76
And it ground to a halt.


971
1:22:2,76 --> 1:22:13,0
We were in a real camping trip for a while
on that, although it worked out.


972
1:22:13,0 --> 1:22:16,44
The arm worked great, RMS.


973
1:22:16,44 --> 1:22:19,21
The main jets I mentioned earlier.


974
1:22:19,21 --> 1:22:23,69
Of course, you don't use the main jets much.


975
1:22:23,69 --> 1:22:27,77
It would be hard to sleep with them booming
away, but you use the Verniers most of the


976
1:22:27,77 --> 1:22:27,88
time.


977
1:22:27,88 --> 1:22:32,81
Verniers are critical to smooth operation
over long periods of time.


978
1:22:32,81 --> 1:22:39,52
We spent a lot of time, for instance, tail
sun.


979
1:22:39,52 --> 1:22:45,62
For like three days we put the tail right
at the sun and stayed in that inertial attitude.


980
1:22:45,62 --> 1:22:51,39
And so it cooked the backend while the front
end of the orbiter is cold.


981
1:22:51,39 --> 1:22:56,58
We took all the Theodolite measurements, opened
and closed the doors.


982
1:22:56,58 --> 1:22:58,38
All of that worked fine.


983
1:22:58,38 --> 1:22:59,93
The systems handled it.


984
1:22:59,93 --> 1:23:1,67
A lot of it was ground analysis.


985
1:23:1,67 --> 1:23:6,14
And how the temperatures were, were extensively
instrumented.


986
1:23:6,14 --> 1:23:12,94
And we did notice a strange thing.


987
1:23:12,94 --> 1:23:15,88
Not strange but it became apparent.


988
1:23:15,88 --> 1:23:24,48
When you are in orbit, when you are on the
sunny side of the earth, as soon as the sun


989
1:23:24,48 --> 1:23:31,31
comes up it is high noon bright, but there
is no atmosphere around to diffuse the light.


990
1:23:31,31 --> 1:23:38,74
When we were at tail sun, it is hidden behind
perfectly eclipsed by the aft structure.


991
1:23:38,74 --> 1:23:46,74
And so, there is no sun ball to be seen anywhere,
even though it is bright sunny from just the


992
1:23:46,74 --> 1:23:50,98
reflections of the structure you can see out
the window.


993
1:23:50,98 --> 1:23:58,37
I noticed, looking at the radiators, which
are very, very smooth concave surfaces out


994
1:23:58,37 --> 1:24:1,19
there and shiny silver colored.


995
1:24:1,19 --> 1:24:9,25
It looked like there were bright diamonds
all along the surface when we were tail sun.


996
1:24:9,25 --> 1:24:14,99
And I finally figured out it was just little
specks of dust on the radiators, which you


997
1:24:14,99 --> 1:24:16,73
wouldn't even notice normally.


998
1:24:16,73 --> 1:24:24,55
But exactly tail sun, the sun's rays are coming
right down exactly tangent to that surface.


999
1:24:24,55 --> 1:24:28,65
And the least little thing on it would flare.


1000
1:24:28,65 --> 1:24:36,46
And interesting effect which took me a while
to figure out what all these bright spots


1001
1:24:36,46 --> 1:24:44,59
on the radiators are.


1002
1:24:44,59 --> 1:24:53,15
Entry on STS-3 was done to an about 1:00 in
the morning landing at White Sands, New Mexico.


1003
1:24:53,15 --> 1:24:54,1
We started the entry.


1004
1:24:54,1 --> 1:25:0,44
Halfway around the world it is dark, and most
of the entry was in the dark.


1005
1:25:0,44 --> 1:25:5,81
The plasma light show that happens, as you
get down in the atmosphere, the ionization


1006
1:25:5,81 --> 1:25:11,42
that happens produces a spectacular scene
out the windshield.


1007
1:25:11,42 --> 1:25:19,6
I mean it also had us thinking about the missing
tiles that are going.


1008
1:25:19,6 --> 1:25:24,15
But a night entry is really a show.


1009
1:25:24,15 --> 1:25:29,36
The next flight was a day entry which was
not nearly as spectacular.


1010
1:25:29,36 --> 1:25:41,98
I mentioned about grabbing the stick too late,
unfair to Jack, and then the de-rotation.


1011
1:25:41,98 --> 1:25:43,85
Now onto part three.


1012
1:25:43,85 --> 1:25:45,5
How am I doing?


1013
1:25:45,5 --> 1:25:46,6
I might make it yet.


1014
1:25:46,6 --> 1:26:0,72
STS-51F was a whole different situation than
the earlier test flights.


1015
1:26:0,72 --> 1:26:5,5
One big difference is there were seven people
instead of two.


1016
1:26:5,5 --> 1:26:9,41
With seven we had to add a little bit on the
patch to put the extra two names.


1017
1:26:9,41 --> 1:26:12,44
This is the ninth flight.


1018
1:26:12,44 --> 1:26:15,6
There are nineteen stars.


1019
1:26:15,6 --> 1:26:15,78
Primary experiments.


1020
1:26:15,78 --> 1:26:16,96
This was a science flight.


1021
1:26:16,96 --> 1:26:19,97
It was a space lab but without the laboratory.


1022
1:26:19,97 --> 1:26:25,9
All equipment in the payload bay full stem
to stern with telescopes mostly.


1023
1:26:25,9 --> 1:26:31,65
And all the telescopes mounted on the pointing
system we had were solar telescopes.


1024
1:26:31,65 --> 1:26:37,57
So we had the sun in the accurate part of
the sky.


1025
1:26:37,57 --> 1:26:46,68
Here is Orion and Leo, the backwards question
mark.


1026
1:26:46,68 --> 1:26:51,32
Nineteen stars.


1027
1:26:51,32 --> 1:27:1,7
A lot of symbology here.


1028
1:27:1,7 --> 1:27:13,23
A short entertaining video.


1029
1:27:13,23 --> 1:27:22,22
We had seven people, including three mission
specialists, which Dr.


1030
1:27:22,22 --> 1:27:25,92
Hoffman was when he was down in Houston.


1031
1:27:25,92 --> 1:27:31,53
And we had two payload specialists, guys who
were not full time astronauts.


1032
1:27:31,53 --> 1:27:33,3
They were solar physicists.


1033
1:27:33,3 --> 1:27:39,74
And they were the experts on the solar telescopes
that we had and went along to fly.


1034
1:27:39,74 --> 1:27:43,78
First try here at main engine ignition ended
three seconds after ignition.


1035
1:27:43,78 --> 1:27:51,6
We felt the spacecraft rock around, the noise
and then nothing.


1036
1:27:51,6 --> 1:28:0,76
And we had a pad shutdown because the left
engine, the automatic system detected a failure,


1037
1:28:0,76 --> 1:28:2,98
a slow-acting valve and it shut us off.


1038
1:28:2,98 --> 1:28:7,4
So we are there wondering if we are on fire
and whether we ought to race out and so forth.


1039
1:28:7,4 --> 1:28:13,28
It was tense for a while but there wasn't
a fire, just this automatic shutdown.


1040
1:28:13,28 --> 1:28:15,79
We crawled out.


1041
1:28:15,79 --> 1:28:24,57
We were told there would be a two-week delay,
so we took the kids to Disneyland and had


1042
1:28:24,57 --> 1:28:28,26
a good time, went back home and started the
whole training cycle again.


1043
1:28:28,26 --> 1:28:34,84
And came back two weeks later and got a good
start this time.


1044
1:28:34,84 --> 1:28:41,27
But not after lying on our back on the pads
strapped in for five hours because of some


1045
1:28:41,27 --> 1:28:48,4
software glitches that had to be fixed and
computers reloaded and tested.


1046
1:28:48,4 --> 1:28:52,49
And one of our reports was five hours is the
limit.


1047
1:28:52,49 --> 1:28:58,49
I mean you are lying on your back with your
feet up in a pressure suit strapped in.


1048
1:28:58,49 --> 1:29:8,71
That is more than is reasonable to ask prior
to launch.


1049
1:29:8,71 --> 1:29:10,74
On the way up, well, I will mention that later.


1050
1:29:10,74 --> 1:29:12,91
Here is the instrument system.


1051
1:29:12,91 --> 1:29:15,4
This baby was built in Germany.


1052
1:29:15,4 --> 1:29:23,15
It is this gimbal device that held these four
solar telescopes and the star trackers.


1053
1:29:23,15 --> 1:29:25,38
Here is a physics experiment.


1054
1:29:25,38 --> 1:29:30,34
The OMS engines are lit and produces one-sixteenth
of a G.


1055
1:29:30,34 --> 1:29:33,92
The thrust of the orbital maneuvering engines.


1056
1:29:33,92 --> 1:29:37,2
If you are trying to sleep, that is what happens
when the OMS engines come on.


1057
1:29:37,2 --> 1:29:44,29
And you saw the water going across.


1058
1:29:44,29 --> 1:29:46,87
It is déjà vu.


1059
1:29:46,87 --> 1:29:52,27
We had the same old PDP package on this, but
with a difference this time.


1060
1:29:52,27 --> 1:29:54,94
We took it out of the payload bay and brought
it up here.


1061
1:29:54,94 --> 1:29:59,56
That is my right ear you are looking at in
profile out the window.


1062
1:29:59,56 --> 1:30:5,24
It is crowded up there with seven people up
on the flight deck all trying to get a view


1063
1:30:5,24 --> 1:30:7,22
here, but we let go of it.


1064
1:30:7,22 --> 1:30:13,37
And it had a momentum wheel in there to cause
it to spin up slowly.


1065
1:30:13,37 --> 1:30:22,62
And we backed away from it and flew a couple
of very challenging loops around it.


1066
1:30:22,62 --> 1:30:26,8
Here is a sequel to the hairbrush.


1067
1:30:26,8 --> 1:30:26,76
This is not me.


1068
1:30:26,76 --> 1:30:33,54
It is Story Musgrave who has the same hairdo
as I do.


1069
1:30:33,54 --> 1:30:37,74
And he is getting spiffed up for the TV show.


1070
1:30:37,74 --> 1:31:0,3
That is all we did is horse around for seven
days.


1071
1:31:0,3 --> 1:31:4,38
It got extended a day to eight days again.


1072
1:31:4,38 --> 1:31:13,24
And this landing was back at Edwards, runway
23 on August 6th when it was 105 degrees,


1073
1:31:13,24 --> 1:31:17,67
lots of heat waves.


1074
1:31:17,67 --> 1:31:22,96
This landing was by far the most forward CG
because we still had all that equipment in


1075
1:31:22,96 --> 1:31:24,65
the payload bay.


1076
1:31:24,65 --> 1:31:32,17
And we were almost the heaviest orbiter landing,
so getting the nose down before it fell down,


1077
1:31:32,17 --> 1:32:1,23
crashed and broke the nose gear was one of
my primary concerns on this one.


1078
1:32:1,23 --> 1:32:4,42
More about the actual launch itself.


1079
1:32:4,42 --> 1:32:5,85
There is the customary view.


1080
1:32:5,85 --> 1:32:18,59
They put a camera right in close and got this
really close-up view, but it was about 5.5


1081
1:32:18,59 --> 1:32:21,61
minutes after this picture.


1082
1:32:21,61 --> 1:32:22,82
We had delayed five hours.


1083
1:32:22,82 --> 1:32:30,69
It is late afternoon so very quickly heading
out over the Atlantic we were in darkness.


1084
1:32:30,69 --> 1:32:31,98
And then, bang.


1085
1:32:31,98 --> 1:32:38,56
Remember the left engine got us on the pad
abort?


1086
1:32:38,56 --> 1:32:42,11
Well, the center engine shut down.


1087
1:32:42,11 --> 1:32:47,9
We were at 3Gs and all of a sudden we are
at 2Gs or something like that.


1088
1:32:47,9 --> 1:32:53,66
Instant square wave cutoff and acceleration.


1089
1:32:53,66 --> 1:32:56,37
Looking there and confirming the center engine
shut down.


1090
1:32:56,37 --> 1:33:1,86
What happened was there are a number of sensors
on the main engines.


1091
1:33:1,86 --> 1:33:9,24
The particular one that got us was the fuel
high pressure turbo pump.


1092
1:33:9,24 --> 1:33:19,13
A piece of machinery running at 75,000 RPM
high pressures.


1093
1:33:19,13 --> 1:33:26,15
The high-tech gear that makes the main engine
so efficient, IISP, but really run at the


1094
1:33:26,15 --> 1:33:31,61
limits of metallurgy and technology.


1095
1:33:31,61 --> 1:33:36,88
The sensor that senses the output temperature
was a series of four platinum wires in the


1096
1:33:36,88 --> 1:33:42,55
cavity in the output of that turbo pump.


1097
1:33:42,55 --> 1:33:45,73
They had some tendency for the wires to burn
through.


1098
1:33:45,73 --> 1:33:53,28
When they burn through, they showed over-temp
was the electrical result of a burn through,


1099
1:33:53,28 --> 1:33:54,28
one of these sensors.


1100
1:33:54,28 --> 1:33:56,91
Well, we had two burn throughs.


1101
1:33:56,91 --> 1:34:3,36
And the software said that must mean there
are two sensors that say you are too hot,


1102
1:34:3,36 --> 1:34:4,81
I will shut the motor off.


1103
1:34:4,81 --> 1:34:6,85
And it did.


1104
1:34:6,85 --> 1:34:20,81
With no reaction we just kept going straight
and smooth, but it now put us into what is


1105
1:34:20,81 --> 1:34:21,49
called an abort.


1106
1:34:21,49 --> 1:34:24,34
Well, here is the crew.


1107
1:34:24,34 --> 1:34:26,96
There are seven of us.


1108
1:34:26,96 --> 1:34:33,75
I need to practice this more.


1109
1:34:33,75 --> 1:34:35,62
But, anyway, it was a two shift operation.


1110
1:34:35,62 --> 1:34:39,55
We were going to work around the clock, so
we had a red team and a blue team.


1111
1:34:39,55 --> 1:34:44,21
And I was the commander so I had a striped
shirt.


1112
1:34:44,21 --> 1:34:44,71
Abort to orbit.


1113
1:34:44,71 --> 1:34:49,98
We had to call from the ground, confirm what
we knew already, which means turning that


1114
1:34:49,98 --> 1:34:54,4
rotary knob to ATO, abort to orbit, kind of
an oxymoron in a way.


1115
1:34:54,4 --> 1:34:55,29
It is not really an abort.


1116
1:34:55,29 --> 1:34:58,5
It is pressing on and pushing the button behind
it.


1117
1:34:58,5 --> 1:35:4,6
It loads the software in to do a couple of
things, lower the insertion target.


1118
1:35:4,6 --> 1:35:11,22
We had tried to get as high orbit as performance
would permit, but now we are going lower.


1119
1:35:11,22 --> 1:35:15,76
Engine down costs you total performance.


1120
1:35:15,76 --> 1:35:20,17
And we also started dumping OMS fuel.


1121
1:35:20,17 --> 1:35:26,1
We had to turn on the OMS engines, and we
ended up dumping 4500 pounds of OMS fuel,


1122
1:35:26,1 --> 1:35:34,47
a little bit of extra thrust but a significant
loss of weight to allow the remaining performance


1123
1:35:34,47 --> 1:35:38,47
to get us to an acceptable orbit.


1124
1:35:38,47 --> 1:35:44,98
And, interestingly, the last sim we did in
training in Houston, before we went to the


1125
1:35:44,98 --> 1:35:51,78
Cape to fly about two days before, was an
integrated sim where we are tied into all


1126
1:35:51,78 --> 1:35:53,73
the controllers and everybody is working as
a team.


1127
1:35:53,73 --> 1:35:59,65
And the very last run we had was an ATO, abort
to orbit.


1128
1:35:59,65 --> 1:36:1,65
And, son of a gun, that is what we did.


1129
1:36:1,65 --> 1:36:5,11
We always had trouble starting a watch.


1130
1:36:5,11 --> 1:36:9,22
And you try to do everything internally on
the crew so that if you lose communication


1131
1:36:9,22 --> 1:36:15,53
with the ground you can complete the emergency
properly on your own.


1132
1:36:15,53 --> 1:36:22,63
On ATOs before, we had to start a stopwatch
at the time we started the OMS dump.


1133
1:36:22,63 --> 1:36:27,4
And we had a chart to go in to find out how
many minutes of OMS dump we needed to do given


1134
1:36:27,4 --> 1:36:31,2
at what velocity we lost the engine.


1135
1:36:31,2 --> 1:36:33,65
And Story's job was to do the watch.


1136
1:36:33,65 --> 1:36:39,11
In the excitement of all the other stuff we
had to do to get the OMS on, we would always


1137
1:36:39,11 --> 1:36:39,47
forget the watch.


1138
1:36:39,47 --> 1:36:43,3
But this time he got the watch going so we
actually did it right.


1139
1:36:43,3 --> 1:36:51,67
And we knew that when we got to where we burned
out all the available fuel, which we did,


1140
1:36:51,67 --> 1:37:1,35
we went to a fuel depletion cutoff, that we
would be really close to having to do right


1141
1:37:1,35 --> 1:37:4,45
away another OMS burn to get an acceptable
orbit.


1142
1:37:4,45 --> 1:37:9,0
We are right on the boundary, as it turned
out.


1143
1:37:9,0 --> 1:37:16,79
We dumped the right amount of OMS, every last
drop of main propellant gone, we were just


1144
1:37:16,79 --> 1:37:26,3
on the boundary of not having to do the first
OMS burn and we could relax 45 minutes later


1145
1:37:26,3 --> 1:37:29,94
halfway around the world to do the final circularization.


1146
1:37:29,94 --> 1:37:35,86
So it worked out good, except we were in a
lot lower orbit than we had planned.


1147
1:37:35,86 --> 1:37:40,77
And everything about this space lab flight
depended on the orbit, so we were into a giant


1148
1:37:40,77 --> 1:37:41,17
re-plan.


1149
1:37:41,17 --> 1:37:45,72
Here is a nice picture of the IPS.


1150
1:37:45,72 --> 1:37:55,17
Gordon, I also explain the situation of the
inhibit switch on and off.


1151
1:37:55,17 --> 1:38:2,2
I don't know how much you were aware of what
was going on there in the cockpit.


1152
1:38:2,2 --> 1:38:8,61
There is a switch in the cockpit.


1153
1:38:8,61 --> 1:38:13,4
You have a lot of parameters that are monitored
in the software on the main engines which,


1154
1:38:13,4 --> 1:38:17,21
if they go out of tolerance, will shut the
engine off.


1155
1:38:17,21 --> 1:38:24,13
In fact, that is exactly why we lost the center
engine.


1156
1:38:24,13 --> 1:38:28,83
But, right after that engine shutdown, we
were in a state where we really don't want


1157
1:38:28,83 --> 1:38:29,74
to lose another engine.


1158
1:38:29,74 --> 1:38:35,53
Because if, with only one left, we did not
have the performance to get to orbit, we would


1159
1:38:35,53 --> 1:38:42,44
have had to have gone to Zaragoza, Spain and
land in the middle of the night where it was


1160
1:38:42,44 --> 1:38:45,6
a 10,000 foot overcast and raining.


1161
1:38:45,6 --> 1:38:51,88
I mean if we pulled that off we would have
deserved some kind of metal.


1162
1:38:51,88 --> 1:38:59,51
And so, as a preplanned procedure, when you
lose one engine before, the point where you


1163
1:38:59,51 --> 1:39:5,36
can stagger into orbit on one remaining engine
you inhibit the limits.


1164
1:39:5,36 --> 1:39:13,42
You throw a switch that says you're telling
the engines to keep running regardless of


1165
1:39:13,42 --> 1:39:18,5
over-temps or anything because you take the
chance, which is a big one if something let


1166
1:39:18,5 --> 1:39:28,77
go, to not be susceptible that got us for
the first engine, that is a sensor failure.


1167
1:39:28,77 --> 1:39:29,78
And so we did that.


1168
1:39:29,78 --> 1:39:35,79
We inhibited the limits until we got to a
point in the energy profile where we were


1169
1:39:35,79 --> 1:39:37,72
"press to MECO." That is the call.


1170
1:39:37,72 --> 1:39:45,87
Press to MECO means that you are now at a
velocity where you can make it into acceptable


1171
1:39:45,87 --> 1:39:51,79
low orbit on one engine if you should lose
another one.


1172
1:39:51,79 --> 1:39:59,8
Press to MECO then the plan was we will re-enable
the limits so we are not hanging it out on


1173
1:39:59,8 --> 1:40:3,51
a possible second engine failure.


1174
1:40:3,51 --> 1:40:7,57
And we would accept a second engine failure
because we knew we could make it on one engine.


1175
1:40:7,57 --> 1:40:12,69
So we did that, the call came up, we went
to enable.


1176
1:40:12,69 --> 1:40:17,6
And then, before we got there, we got another
call from the ground that said go back to


1177
1:40:17,6 --> 1:40:18,87
inhibit.


1178
1:40:18,87 --> 1:40:21,72
Well, it wasn't time to get a full explanation.


1179
1:40:21,72 --> 1:40:23,99
We dutifully did it.


1180
1:40:23,99 --> 1:40:28,49
What they saw on the ground is more failures
on the right engine.


1181
1:40:28,49 --> 1:40:30,57
Remember the left got us on the pad abort?


1182
1:40:30,57 --> 1:40:32,74
The center engine shut down on the way up.


1183
1:40:32,74 --> 1:40:39,61
And, to make everything equal, the right engine,
the same sensors they can see on the ground,


1184
1:40:39,61 --> 1:40:45,65
it is not visible in the cockpit, each of
those four platinum wires they saw starting


1185
1:40:45,65 --> 1:40:47,82
to go.


1186
1:40:47,82 --> 1:40:50,6
Clearly a design problem here.


1187
1:40:50,6 --> 1:40:55,79
And they could tell those were going to go
and get us that second engine, so that is


1188
1:40:55,79 --> 1:40:58,94
why we went back to inhibit for the rest of
the way.


1189
1:40:58,94 --> 1:41:4,65
It made a good war story, but we got there.


1190
1:41:4,65 --> 1:41:10,63
We started operating the IPS.


1191
1:41:10,63 --> 1:41:15,99
A platform built in Germany with all the telescopes.


1192
1:41:15,99 --> 1:41:19,46
These are start trackers to align where it
is.


1193
1:41:19,46 --> 1:41:22,15
And this baby could point.


1194
1:41:22,15 --> 1:41:26,26
The spec was one arch second of accuracy.


1195
1:41:26,26 --> 1:41:29,33
An arch second is the size of a dime.


1196
1:41:29,33 --> 1:41:36,9
If you are standing at the capital and looking
at dime at the Lincoln Memorial, that is how


1197
1:41:36,9 --> 1:41:38,8
much.


1198
1:41:38,8 --> 1:41:42,9
But, when we cranked it up, it didn't work
worth a hoot.


1199
1:41:42,9 --> 1:41:46,84
They just couldn't get it to stabilize or
point where it was supposed to.


1200
1:41:46,84 --> 1:41:52,35
And, for three days, the payload specialists
and the MSs were in constant communication


1201
1:41:52,35 --> 1:41:54,11
with the ground.


1202
1:41:54,11 --> 1:41:59,56
And they patched the software in a major way
and kept sending up new software loads to


1203
1:41:59,56 --> 1:42:1,62
get this thing to work.


1204
1:42:1,62 --> 1:42:9,79
And viola, on the third day they finally got
it right, then it worked well and got a lot


1205
1:42:9,79 --> 1:42:14,82
of good solar science.


1206
1:42:14,82 --> 1:42:23,63
Just an aside, when you are looking at pictures
from space, you tend to think you walk around


1207
1:42:23,63 --> 1:42:26,6
out here and the atmosphere is this big ocean
of air above you, right?


1208
1:42:26,6 --> 1:42:30,1
Lots of air way up there.


1209
1:42:30,1 --> 1:42:37,34
This little bitty blue line right there, barely
perceptible, there always appears on any sunlit


1210
1:42:37,34 --> 1:42:46,13
picture showing the limb of the earth, that
is the same blue as the scattering that causes


1211
1:42:46,13 --> 1:42:47,76
the sky to be blue.


1212
1:42:47,76 --> 1:42:50,2
And that is how thick it is.


1213
1:42:50,2 --> 1:42:54,92
It is just this little thin shell of atmosphere
around.


1214
1:42:54,92 --> 1:43:5,91
At 18,000 feet three miles up you have lost
half the atmospheric pressure.


1215
1:43:5,91 --> 1:43:10,0
And that is laying on an 8,000 mile diameter
globe.


1216
1:43:10,0 --> 1:43:18,3
And so that is where all of human history
has happened, in that little shell over there


1217
1:43:18,3 --> 1:43:19,94
laying around the globe.


1218
1:43:19,94 --> 1:43:25,69
A philosophical point for you engineers.


1219
1:43:25,69 --> 1:43:28,11
What is flying on orbit like?


1220
1:43:28,11 --> 1:43:34,43
Well, it is one of the 215 pounds of checklist.


1221
1:43:34,43 --> 1:43:39,98
Here I am checking propellant usage against
what we've got and where we are because we


1222
1:43:39,98 --> 1:43:49,6
dumped 4,500 pounds of crucial fuel that we
needed to make the planned most maneuvers


1223
1:43:49,6 --> 1:43:55,58
that ever been done in the orbit on our mission.


1224
1:43:55,58 --> 1:44:1,91
We didn't want an extra blip out of an RCS
thruster, and it worked very well.


1225
1:44:1,91 --> 1:44:7,15
We got through seven days and even had enough
to have another day of science on the eighth


1226
1:44:7,15 --> 1:44:7,23
day.


1227
1:44:7,23 --> 1:44:11,53
Flying is mostly watching the clock.


1228
1:44:11,53 --> 1:44:15,11
Everything happens according to time.


1229
1:44:15,11 --> 1:44:21,36
And, since you have 16 sunrises and sunsets
every 24 hours, you never know what time it


1230
1:44:21,36 --> 1:44:24,78
is without looking at a watch.


1231
1:44:24,78 --> 1:44:29,3
And you are looking at a crew activity plan
with everything laid out.


1232
1:44:29,3 --> 1:44:40,9
And we even had an alarm system you could
set in the CRT to make a tone to wake you


1233
1:44:40,9 --> 1:44:40,45
up.


1234
1:44:40,45 --> 1:44:45,22
It is a lot of clock watching to pull off
a complex mission like this.


1235
1:44:45,22 --> 1:44:47,4
It is just the way life is on orbit.


1236
1:44:47,4 --> 1:44:56,86
Now, here is one of our really serious high-level
scientific objectives.


1237
1:44:56,86 --> 1:44:59,44
This was the official name, the Carbonated
Beverage Test.


1238
1:44:59,44 --> 1:45:4,44
I don't know if it was an MIT guy or not.


1239
1:45:4,44 --> 1:45:9,98
He was a real serious academic type.


1240
1:45:9,98 --> 1:45:12,38
An Indian I think.


1241
1:45:12,38 --> 1:45:23,59
Anyway, he built a Coke can that had a lot
of pressure regulators in there and laminar


1242
1:45:23,59 --> 1:45:27,59
flow annular things.


1243
1:45:27,59 --> 1:45:31,5
So many that this Coke can only held four
ounces of Coke.


1244
1:45:31,5 --> 1:45:34,54
But he talked to the White House.


1245
1:45:34,54 --> 1:45:35,65
Reagan was president.


1246
1:45:35,65 --> 1:45:42,56
And somebody on the staff approved we are
going to fly these Coke cans and see if they


1247
1:45:42,56 --> 1:45:49,28
had a system to provide pop in orbit with
the regular kind of carbonation and dispense


1248
1:45:49,28 --> 1:45:51,76
OK.


1249
1:45:51,76 --> 1:45:55,5
We got the briefing and we had the four stowed
in a locker.


1250
1:45:55,5 --> 1:45:57,88
And I got them out at the start of the test.


1251
1:45:57,88 --> 1:46:3,81
But 30 days before launch, all of a sudden
this big thing came down.


1252
1:46:3,81 --> 1:46:10,67
Pepsi got wind of this experiment and went
to the White House staff and they got Pepsi


1253
1:46:10,67 --> 1:46:11,51
put on.


1254
1:46:11,51 --> 1:46:19,14
Pepsi went into a crash program to fly more
cans of Pepsi.


1255
1:46:19,14 --> 1:46:24,88
Here is Carl trying the Pepsi.


1256
1:46:24,88 --> 1:46:29,25
You notice that looks a lot like a shaving
cream can.


1257
1:46:29,25 --> 1:46:35,52
Well, that's how the Pepsi came out, just
like shaving cream, this frothy ball of stuff.


1258
1:46:35,52 --> 1:46:37,86
I mean theirs was the last minute deal.


1259
1:46:37,86 --> 1:46:41,18
It didn't have any pressure regulators in
it.


1260
1:46:41,18 --> 1:46:47,74
It just went out there.


1261
1:46:47,74 --> 1:46:51,34
Now we worried about having to make a judgment,
which tasted better.


1262
1:46:51,34 --> 1:46:58,85
Well, the problem was we didn't have any kind
of refrigerator so they are both warm.


1263
1:46:58,85 --> 1:47:4,55
Warm pop is not my favorite.


1264
1:47:4,55 --> 1:47:16,8
And so, they were not anything anybody fought
over, either kind.


1265
1:47:16,8 --> 1:47:23,95
If you let the Pepsi float around it would
coalesce a little CO2 in random fashion, but


1266
1:47:23,95 --> 1:47:31,28
the physics of it, Carl found by blowing very
carefully on the edge you could get it spinning


1267
1:47:31,28 --> 1:47:33,38
up.


1268
1:47:33,38 --> 1:47:40,97
And spinning Pepsi would have the froth at
the poles and the liquid around the equator.


1269
1:47:40,97 --> 1:47:51,5
And we always had a tall guy standing by in
case it drifted into something.


1270
1:47:51,5 --> 1:47:52,55
This is the end of the experiment here.


1271
1:47:52,55 --> 1:47:59,78
He got it into his mouth without touching
any of it.


1272
1:47:59,78 --> 1:48:6,55
We had the same PDP but, as I mentioned and
as you saw in the movie, we let go of it.


1273
1:48:6,55 --> 1:48:10,73
We actually maneuvered all around the orbit
and looked at the wake through the plasma,


1274
1:48:10,73 --> 1:48:11,85
let go of it.


1275
1:48:11,85 --> 1:48:18,52
The proximity ops were very extensive and
challenging and many, many maneuvers.


1276
1:48:18,52 --> 1:48:20,7
That is in the Caribbean.


1277
1:48:20,7 --> 1:48:21,69
The tongue of the ocean.


1278
1:48:21,69 --> 1:48:25,95
A spectacular coral reef around very deep
water.


1279
1:48:25,95 --> 1:48:28,88
Here is the Gibraltar.


1280
1:48:28,88 --> 1:48:32,63
The rock, I believe, is out on the point.


1281
1:48:32,63 --> 1:48:38,19
The Mediterranean here and the Atlantic here.


1282
1:48:38,19 --> 1:48:40,28
You've heard you cannot see borders in space.


1283
1:48:40,28 --> 1:48:41,62
Not true.


1284
1:48:41,62 --> 1:48:49,33
This is Israel this way and Egypt this way
and the Gaza strip along here, which has been


1285
1:48:49,33 --> 1:48:53,47
in the news as of late.


1286
1:48:53,47 --> 1:48:56,33
And in the same area the Dead Sea, the Sea
of Galilee.


1287
1:48:56,33 --> 1:48:58,3
Here is most of Israel in one picture.


1288
1:48:58,3 --> 1:49:4,22
A little closer to home.


1289
1:49:4,22 --> 1:49:6,9
This is most of New Jersey.


1290
1:49:6,9 --> 1:49:7,61
Long Island.


1291
1:49:7,61 --> 1:49:8,42
There is Manhattan.


1292
1:49:8,42 --> 1:49:11,39
Hudson River and East River.


1293
1:49:11,39 --> 1:49:18,61
There are about 10,000 copies of this picture.


1294
1:49:18,61 --> 1:49:20,22
This is Southern California.


1295
1:49:20,22 --> 1:49:21,81
This is San Diego right here.


1296
1:49:21,81 --> 1:49:23,88
Los Angeles.


1297
1:49:23,88 --> 1:49:29,72
And, in high rise print, you can see water
here which is San Francisco Bay.


1298
1:49:29,72 --> 1:49:36,88
And the center of it all is the Antelope Valley
right here where I live and where Edwards


1299
1:49:36,88 --> 1:49:38,4
is right here.


1300
1:49:38,4 --> 1:49:44,11
This is the San Andreas Fault right through
here.


1301
1:49:44,11 --> 1:49:52,55
Closer up of LA which, at the end of 51F,
we came right by Catalina Island, right up


1302
1:49:52,55 --> 1:49:54,83
the Harbor Freeway into Edwards.


1303
1:49:54,83 --> 1:50:3,17
And we went by Harbor Freeway at about mach
3.


1304
1:50:3,17 --> 1:50:6,0
And closer up of the dry lake at Edwards.


1305
1:50:6,0 --> 1:50:8,55
And the landing.


1306
1:50:8,55 --> 1:50:15,79
Flight test results most of which I have mentioned
already.


1307
1:50:15,79 --> 1:50:24,22
And, to finish up, I have reports on a memory
stick here, the pilot reports we wrote as


1308
1:50:24,22 --> 1:50:28,9
crews which you can take at your leisure.


1309
1:50:28,9 --> 1:50:30,739
If you are interested, copy it off.


1310
1:50:30,739 --> 1:50:32,9
They are available.


1311
1:50:32,9 --> 1:50:41,38
Not great works of art, but the specific things
that we learned on doing the flight test.


1312
1:50:41,38 --> 1:50:50,14
And these are just thoughts of transitioning
into operation from test mode, which I got


1313
1:50:50,14 --> 1:50:53,97
to see the whole gamut from beginning to full
operational.


1314
1:50:53,97 --> 1:50:56,75
I apologize for running over.


1315
1:50:56,75 --> 1:51:0,43
I don't think anybody minded.


1316
1:51:0,43 --> 1:51:4,23
As you see, everybody is listening very intently.


1317
1:51:4,23 --> 1:51:6,489
Thank you very much for taking the time.


1318
1:51:6,489 --> 1:53:6,489
[APPLAUSE]
