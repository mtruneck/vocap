1
0:0:0,149 --> 0:0:4,9
so is rather to full immigration from
these is first of all those refugees are


2
0:0:4,9 --> 0:0:7,549
from sudan and that are in the country
and there's been


3
0:0:7,549 --> 0:0:11,59
a lot of uh... education over that


4
0:0:11,59 --> 0:0:12,429
you know israelis


5
0:0:12,429 --> 0:0:14,47
protest saying marching


6
0:0:14,47 --> 0:0:18,359
sometimes yelling at sudanese women


7
0:0:18,359 --> 0:0:22,429
and men and calling them a lot of matter
words


8
0:0:22,429 --> 0:0:27,419
uh... basically say sydney's go home you
not welcome here your criminals in one


9
0:0:27,419 --> 0:0:30,429
instance shouting at them your force and
saturn


10
0:0:30,429 --> 0:0:33,969
now of courses are irony there israel
was created


11
0:0:33,969 --> 0:0:37,91
because nobody would take in the jews
during the holocaust


12
0:0:37,91 --> 0:0:41,18
that seems like an excellent
justification and the one that is used


13
0:0:41,18 --> 0:0:44,38
most often understandably so


14
0:0:44,38 --> 0:0:46,8
now the sudanese


15
0:0:46,8 --> 0:0:49,789
have not been treated well not just in
sudan the ones that are fleeing


16
0:0:49,789 --> 0:0:52,789
but also in inject and other muslim
countries as well


17
0:0:52,789 --> 0:0:56,849
golombek christian an airplane because
they're being persecuted because of


18
0:0:56,849 --> 0:0:58,28
religious reasons


19
0:0:58,28 --> 0:1:0,6
now you would hope that


20
0:1:0,6 --> 0:1:3,65
of all the countries in the world israel
would understand that that's


21
0:1:3,65 --> 0:1:6,27
but that's actually the least of their
immigration problems


22
0:1:6,27 --> 0:1:9,92
they also have the hundred and thirty
thousand easy opiates now in this case


23
0:1:9,92 --> 0:1:13,97
they've europeans are george so it does
really matters and jewish state so that


24
0:1:13,97 --> 0:1:15,53
they should be welcome right


25
0:1:15,53 --> 0:1:17,4
well not exactly


26
0:1:17,4 --> 0:1:20,1
their health ministry has just admitted


27
0:1:20,1 --> 0:1:22,72
that they were doing forced
sterilization


28
0:1:22,72 --> 0:1:25,56
of ethiopian women even though there
george


29
0:1:25,56 --> 0:1:27,18
as they were coming into the country


30
0:1:27,18 --> 0:1:30,35
now thank of association is not
permanent


31
0:1:30,35 --> 0:1:33,729
but he did last for a long time in front
of the last ten years


32
0:1:33,729 --> 0:1:37,59
the birth rate among ethiopians in
israel has dropped


33
0:1:37,59 --> 0:1:40,46
fifty percent


34
0:1:40,46 --> 0:1:43,52
you know not to speculate as to why as i
just told you


35
0:1:43,52 --> 0:1:47,47
israel's health minister has admitted
they did the program and in fact he sent


36
0:1:47,47 --> 0:1:49,35
out a note saying


37
0:1:49,35 --> 0:1:53,87
not to renew prescriptions for double
pro-growth for women of the ethiopian or


38
0:1:53,87 --> 0:1:57,83
chin if for any reason there is concern
that they might not understand the


39
0:1:57,83 --> 0:1:59,7
ramifications of the treatment


40
0:1:59,7 --> 0:2:2,22
i don't think the issue was that they
didn't understand the ramp dishes the


41
0:2:2,22 --> 0:2:5,67
treatment issue was as they were coming
in they were told


42
0:2:5,67 --> 0:2:7,76
had to get that


43
0:2:7,76 --> 0:2:11,7
sometimes they were lying to us at all
you had said back soonish minutes


44
0:2:11,7 --> 0:2:14,679
but their help you with your health


45
0:2:14,679 --> 0:2:17,809
one of the women that were interviewed
the thirty different one saying the same


46
0:2:17,809 --> 0:2:20,589
thing i was uh...


47
0:2:20,589 --> 0:2:25,81
saying quoted as saying quote they told
us their inoculations they told us


48
0:2:25,81 --> 0:2:28,499
people who for quickly give birth supper


49
0:2:28,499 --> 0:2:30,54
we can get every three months


50
0:2:30,54 --> 0:2:33,879
we said we didn't want to


51
0:2:33,879 --> 0:2:36,689
israel's not the only country with
racism


52
0:2:36,689 --> 0:2:41,39
mainly the united states of america we
had slavery here and proms a recent


53
0:2:41,39 --> 0:2:41,72
still


54
0:2:41,72 --> 0:2:44,709
exists in this country as well as many
other countries


55
0:2:44,709 --> 0:2:46,249
but that inspired


56
0:2:46,249 --> 0:2:48,349
really embarrassing


57
0:2:48,349 --> 0:2:51,719
i mean if you're going to be a jewish
state and that you do this to fellow


58
0:2:51,719 --> 0:2:54,359
jews what just 'cause they're african


59
0:2:54,359 --> 0:2:56,249
because they're black or


60
0:2:56,249 --> 0:2:59,49
people of israel should be a livid over
that


61
0:2:59,49 --> 0:3:2,669
and i wish they were also livid over the
sudan situation


62
0:3:2,669 --> 0:3:6,489
on forcefully pepole out


63
0:3:6,489 --> 0:3:8,729
is really frightening


64
0:3:8,729 --> 0:3:10,249
uh...


65
0:3:10,249 --> 0:3:13,639
fifty two percent of israelis say


66
0:3:13,639 --> 0:3:18,359
that uh... afrin asylum-seekers or
quartet cancer


67
0:3:18,359 --> 0:3:20,65
that's fifty two percent that's a
majority


68
0:3:20,65 --> 0:3:24,939
and one-third of israelis said that they
support


69
0:3:24,939 --> 0:3:26,739
violent attacks


70
0:3:26,739 --> 0:3:29,229
on african seeking asylum


71
0:3:29,229 --> 0:3:32,519
that is at terrible number


72
0:3:32,519 --> 0:3:38,139
parable


73
0:3:38,139 --> 0:3:40,249
there's a lot they could be improved
upon in


74
0:3:40,249 --> 0:3:43,229
all the different countries in the world
including the u_s_


75
0:3:43,229 --> 0:3:44,93
that's something that israel


76
0:3:44,93 --> 0:3:47,79
definitely needs to work out


77
0:3:47,79 --> 0:5:47,79
young turks
