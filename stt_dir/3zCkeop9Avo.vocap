###0 ANDREW GREEN: Today we catch up with Drake.
###1 We hear about one of the craziest nights Nas has ever
###3 experienced.
###4 And we explore the weird corners of the World Wide Web.
###6 
###15 NAS: Yo, what up?
###16 This is Nas, and this like a crazy party, crazy thing I
###20 remember from back in the days.
###23 I went to a party in the city for the Shaft movie premier
###27 with Samuel Jackson--
###29 New York City nightclub.
###32 All of the sudden, I'm in the middle of Wesley Snipes and
###35 Grace Jones.
###37 Wesley had on black.
###38 And he was chilling.
###40 And Grace was chilling-- very beautiful.
###42 Grace Jones knocked my drink on my arm, and some of it got
###47 on her arm.
###48 She's didn't see me there.
###49 She just did it by mistake.
###50 And I looked.
###52 She looked at me.
###53 She grabbed me and she--
###56 her arm, it was sleeveless.
###58 She looked at her arm where the drink had fell and just
###61 licked her arm where the drink had fell.
###64 And I was a few things--
###65 I was starstruck, turned on, I thought I was in
###69 the Twilight Zone.
###70 And she probably didn't even who I was.
###72 But I knew who she is--
###73 I'm a fan.
###74 And someone else grabbed me.
###76 It's Wesley Snipes.
###77 Oh shit, he pushed me.
###79 And he's asked me: are you a rapper or a scientist?
###82 And I'm like damn, Wesley Snipes pushed me kinda hard,
###85 like, that's Wesley and everything, but he's pushing
###88 me, like, what's going on?
###90 "I said, are you a rapper or a scientist?" And I'm like damn,
###93 Wesley Snipes is about to do some Blade shit to me.
###97 So I pushed him back.
###98 Boom!
###99 And I said, you won't make it out of here alive, man.
###101 Wesley realized, why am I pushing Nas?
###105 And I'm like like, why am I pushing back Wesley?
###109 And where's Grace Jones at?
###111 It was just a weird little moment right there, so.
###114 And that was some crazy-ass shit from back in the days
###117 around the way.
###118 Love those days.
###121 ANDREW GREEN: I thought Wesley Snipes was in prison.
###123 Next up, we check back in with our real-life Muppet, Hanson
###126 O'Haver, for another installment of, "What's Up
###129 With Drake?"
###130 HANSON O'HAVER: I'm Hanson O'Haver.
###131 This is "What's Up with Drake."
###136 So I'd like to take some time today to address what's kind
###138 of the most common criticism of Drake, which is that he has
###141 no sense of humor about himself.
###144 And you know, I don't know Drake personally, so for all I
###146 know he could be a perfectly modest and just
###149 affable young man.
###150 But I'll agree that the way he presents himself is as someone
###153 who takes himself too seriously.
###155 For example, he tweets things like, "I don't have an
###158 addictive personality, but I'm hooked on it." Or, like, posts
###161 ridiculous photos of himself on his own blog.
###164 And in any normal situation this would take away from an
###166 artist's charm.
###168 We like people that are kind of self-effacing.
###172 And musicians who take themselves really seriously
###173 are the worst.
###174 For example, think of Creed, or, like, Bono with this
###178 tinted sunglasses and his arms spread like a sort of rock and
###181 roll Jesus.
###182 Every once in a while due to a combination of synergy, and
###185 luck, and whatever else, for a brief period of time,
###188 everything that a musician does is flawless.
###191 And during this period, if they were to present
###194 themselves in a less-than-serious manner, it
###196 would only take away from their charm.
###200 For example, think of Prince's Purple Rain.
###202 Everyone agrees that it's amazing.
###204 But it's also totally insane.
###206 Yet if Prince were to acknowledge this and to, sort
###209 of, wink at his audience and say, hey guys, I know that you
###212 guys know that this is totally silly, the whole thing would
###215 have been ruined.
###216 I think that right now we've reached this sort of "peak
###219 Drake," where everything that he does is amazing--
###221 from his albums, to his videos, to his guest spot on
###225 the new Meek Millz song.
###226 And as long as he continues in this manner, there's no reason
###228 that he needs to present himself as anything less than
###230 just a totally serious guy making serious music about his
###234 really serious emotions.
###235 
###240 ANDREW GREEN: Why do I have this weird feeling that
###242 Drake's going to steal Hanson from Vice just to
###244 become his hype man?
###245 And finally, we check back in with our buddy Thomas Morton,
###248 a Dickens character that time forgot, to get his take on all
###251 of the shit that we waste our lives on instead of getting
###253 anything productive done.
###255 It's time for another episode of "Whatcha Watching?"
###259 THOMAS MORTON: Hi, welcome to the Vice offices.
###261 As you can see, everybody here is doing a very good job
###263 looking busy.
###264 They're all at computers, though, which means what
###266 they're actually doing is, basically, what you're doing--
###268 screwing around on the internet.
###270 I work on a computer, too.
###272 I'm no stranger to YouTube links.
###275 And so I've decided to put together a few of my favorites
###277 from this week.
###278 So come enjoy the cream of the crap.
###281 
###285 Hey, so it's been a little bit.
###288 I thought we'd play a little catch-up.
###290 This first video is actually, I think, the first video I
###292 watched on the internet.
###294 It's a short and quick one.
###295 It's titled "Burrito Punch." A tormented, heavy-set, Angus
###298 kind of kid is pelted with a burrito and then exacts really
###301 quick schoolyard justice.
###304 MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh shit.
###306 MALE SPEAKER 2: What the hell, man?
###307 ANDREW GREEN: So, continuing on the sort of ad hoc theme
###309 we've got going of justice and comeuppance is a stark
###313 morality play called "The Story of Mr. Dollar." Mr.
###316 Dollar, as you can see, is kind of a ramshackle dollar
###320 store operation out in Bushwick.
###322 And here you see its owner doing a less-than-effective
###325 job cleaning up standing rainwater on its roof.
###329 And in a moment of Buster Keaton-esque comedic timing,
###333 you can see the ladder raises and marches off frame.
###339 So the second part takes place a month later and is basically
###343 a static shot of the damage that the standing water he
###346 never fully removed from his room has done, which has
###350 basically destroyed his business.
###352 [LAUGH]
###355 What starts as your basic kind of angry human baby berating
###359 service industry employees video is turned on its head by
###363 the interruption of this skinny little nerdlinger.
###367 If you read the comments, it turns out to be a varsity
###370 Greco-Roman wrestler who just happens to be a
###373 Whataburger at 3:00 AM--
###374 probably stoned, visibly stoned.
###376 MALE SPEAKER 3: I asked you for a cheeseburger.
###378 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I'm sorry, what did you say?
###379 MALE SPEAKER 3: I asked you for a cheeseburger!
###381 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Shut up!
###384 MALE SPEAKER 4: Let them go.
###385 Let them go.
###386 [LAUGHTER]
###388 MALE SPEAKER 4: Let them go.
###390 [LAUGHTER]
###392 THOMAS MORTON: To keep this from getting too kind of,
###394 like, morality-heavy, next is a simple slice of life from
###399 either North England or Scotland.
###403 It's basically a guy who sees a trampoline
###405 passing by in a storm.
###407 MALE SPEAKER 5: Oh my god.
###408 Trampoline.
###409 Trampoline.
###409 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Oh yeah.
###411 MALE SPEAKER 5: Oh my god.
###412 Oh my god.
###413 THOMAS MORTON: A picture-perfect sort of
###414 life-imitates-art callback to one of the greatest moments of
###418 1990s animation.
###421 HOMER SIMPSON: [GASP]
###422 Oh my god!
###424 LISA SIMPSON: What is it?
###425 HOMER SIMPSON: Tramampoline!
###426 Trambopoline!
###429 THOMAS MORTON: I don't think I've ever said trampoline
###431 right since the airing of that episode.
###434 To close this week, I wanted to show you guys a favored
###438 video of a, it's sort of, it's a flying lawnmower that I
###441 think they sell to model airplanes enthusiasts this set
###444 to the tune of the moon level from NES's Duck Tales, adding
###450 a twinge of nostalgia to the general air of serenity that
###454 this should instill in you.
###456 [8-BIT MUSIC PLAYING]
###472 THOMAS MORTON: Well, that's it for now.
###473 We'll be back next week.
