###0 Conflict resolution or how to avoid conflict
###5 with other people is a typical problem of everybody.
###9 The reason for conflict is because people come from different places
###14 different environments, and they bring with them attitudes
###18 which they picked up there. Merely commanding another person
###23 saying to another person "You ought not to think the way you think"
###27 does not alter the behavior.
###30 If you really want to get along with people
###34 only when they say to you
###36 "What's the best way to put the shovel into the ground?" "Use your foot.
###41 It's easier. " If they don't ask you, let it go.
###46 The best way to avoid conflict is to not
###49 superimpose your values, even though they're better
###52 than the other person's values.
###55 Roxanne may like cats.
###58 I don't like cats in the house because they...
###63 I feel that they're dirty and all that, but anyway...
###67 The question is: How much do I like Roxanne?
###72 If she doesn't mean that much to me
###74 I say "The cats go or I'll go."
###77 When you deal with people
###80 whatever their views are, unless they say to you
###84 "What do you think of my views? " then you can give your opinion.
###89 Like sometimes
###92 Joel may feel that his boss
###96 is not correct in his values.
###99 If you were to confront him with saner values
###103 he would not understand it.
###105 He would resent it too because it's a put-down.
###111 When you meet people
###113 they tell you what their values are by the way they speak
###117 the way they talk about different things.
###120 Unless they say to you "What do you think of my values?"
###123 then you open up, or "What do you think of the way I use the paintbrush?"
###129 If they say to you "That's no way to use a paintbrush"
###132 that doesn't tell you how.
###134 You wipe it on the can, or whatever it is, you can tell them.
###139 Very few people, unless they're going to school to study
###143 aviation mechanics, they go there to learn what this guy has to say
###149 but if one of the students tells them something
###153 they would feel put-down.
###155 The student says "Well, you don't understand the mechanics
###160 of a piston engine. " That's a put-down
###164 because the student is telling that. If the instructor told him that
###168 he went there to study plumbing or art
###172 or music, so you listen to an instructor.
###176 You're there to learn what they have to tell you
###179 but when you meet ordinary people...
###182 If Roxanne is working on something
###185 and it's very important to her, and there's a phone call
###190 which detracts her away from that
###192 and she may go back and not continue along the lines.
###196 If you say "You should continue along the lines you're working at..."
###202 Unless she said "Christ, I'm terribly disorganized
###207 what do you suggest I do?"
###209 Then you write 1,2,3,4,5
###213 and she says "I don't like 4 and 5."
###216 But don't argue with her. If she says "I'm not sure of 4 and 5"
###221 then you can instruct her. The language tells you
###224 when a person wants to hear more or no more.
###228 Anything you say is a put-down to normal people
###232 if it improves, if it's overseeing
###236 overseeing the other person's shortcomings.
###240 If another person has shortcomings
###243 you work with those shortcomings, unless they say
###248 "How were you able to accomplish four films a day
###252 and I can only do one?"
###254 Then you can say "Because you clean out, you bake with the oven
###258 and then you water the lawn, then you go back to your job."
###262 You have to stay with each system. Do you understand what I mean?
###266 If you get out to do a bridge and in the meantime you water the roses
###271 and trim trees, a lot of things remain half-done.
###275 I don't say you do that
###277 but if you walk over to Larry and say "Don't do it that way. Do it this way"
###283 you're superimposing your values. They may be right
###286 but you don't superimpose unless they ask you.
###290 Conflict occurs
###292 when a person doesn't seek your advice and you advise them.
###297 It doesn't always occur, but it will.
###300 The way to get along with people
###302 is to let them be what they are, unless they say
###307 "I don't seem to get along with polocks. What's my problem?"
###312 Very few people do that.
###314 Very few people... In fact I've never run into a person that said
###318 "What do you think of my value system?
###322 What do you think of the way I think?"
###325 If they do that and it's sincere, not an ego thing
###330 where they appear to be polite.
###335 If a person annoys you in some way
###339 just say "I don't like to discuss races.
###344 I mean if you want to be racist OK, I'm not interested in that."
###347 If he says "How come you don't see niggers the way I see them?"
###351 you can explain.
###353 But if he says "Well, God damn it, that's the way I feel," let him talk
###358 or discharge him, if you hired him and you don't want to hear that.
###364 We hired a guy... There was a black man up on a pole
###368 working on an antenna.
###371 And the guy says "I need some rope."
###374 He says "Tie it around your neck. If you fall you'll hang yourself."
###377 He thought that was appropriate for the black guy.
###381 We never hired him again because he was too low grade.
###386 To undo that, you have to undo his whole life
###390 and either you hire a guy to put up an antenna
###394 or you work on his whole life.
###396 The question is: How different is the person's background than yours?
###402 Does the person seek information and if they did
###407 don't feel like you're instructing them.
###410 If you come over and say "Larry, that's no way to use
###415 a paint remover"
###416 the best thing to do is to say "I used to do it that way
###419 then some other guy told me another way."
###422 They don't like personal criticism coming from you.
###426 I don't get involved in that kind of discussion
###429 because it can't go anywhere, unless the person says
###433 "What do you think of the God damn Mexicans coming into this country?"
###437 "I think the same way about 'unloyal' Americans
###442 that don't appreciate this country," instead of attacking the Spanish people.
###447 Say, "I find Americans, some of them, to be very offensive
###452 and some to be OK" but you need not get onto the Spaniards
###457 because he has a fixed view of Spaniards.
###460 You say "There are plenty of Americans that are subversive."
###464 He would agree with you as a rule
###466 and if he says "Well, I don't know, I've found an American..." then get off
###471 if he doesn't want to discuss it
###474 if he feels satisfied with his point of view.
###477 The main thing you have to keep in mind
###480 is other people come from different places
###483 and they see the same thing you see
###485 but their interpretation is different.
###488 Unless they call for answers
###490 "What do you think I ought to do?"
###493 If a person has a short memory, make notes.
###496 You tell them that once or twice
###498 but not continuously, if they don't apply it.
###502 You give people instructions.
###505 If they apply it, give them further instructions.
###509 If they don't apply them, it means it's just a verbal pastime.
###515 "What do you suggest I do? My wife likes cats, and I like dogs."
###521 You don't have to come up with some story:
###524 Let her have her cats so she lets you have your dogs.
###528 In working with conflict
###532 you do it once or twice.
###534 You say "It seems to me if you held the drill this way
###539 first, it would work better and that's what I found."
###543 But if a person doesn't ask you and they're busy drilling
###546 and they say "I don't want your fuckin' advice!
###549 You tend to your computer, I'll tend to my drilling."
###553 Sometimes people don't want advice. They feel they're being put down.
###559 Stop giving one another advice. That produces antagonism
###563 unless they ask for it.
###565 Is this an absolute formula?
###567 It's a better way of dealing with people
###570 because you can't turn them around
###573 by pointing out "The trouble with you is
###576 you don't listen to anybody! " That doesn't cause them to now listen.
###580 They'll go on with their same pattern
###583 unless they say to you "Am I inattentive?"
###586 or "Do I appear inattentive?"
###589 Very few people talk like that. That's what sane means.
###593 Sane means, when a person comes over to you and says
###596 "I'm not familiar with that jigsaw, how to use it."
###600 Then you instruct them. If they come over
###604 everyday and say "I don't know how to use a jigsaw"
###607 watch them and guide them through it.
###611 Does that make sense?
###613 Do you have any attitudes now about different people
###616 that think differently than you do?
###619 They think differently than you do, period.
###621 Making a comment as "You're dimwitted" or "slow"
###625 "The trouble with you is that you have no imagination!"
###628 that doesn't alter behavior. It only increases conflict.
###632 Do you understand what I'm saying?
###635 If a person's a very good painter of roses
###639 and you like roses, then you associate with him for that reason
###644 but if he says "If you just ask me
###646 all the Irish ought to be sent back to Ireland"
###649 say "Well, I don't feel that way about the Irish
###654 so I'd rather not discuss it."
###656 "I think there are Swedes that behave badly
###659 and some Swedes that behave well. " You can say that.
###664 He might understand that "... but I appreciate your comments."
###669 Don't wipe him out. "You're a racist!"
###672 Don't wipe him out.
