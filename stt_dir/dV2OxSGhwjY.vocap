###12 NINA MAK: When the media covers pet cloning, it's often
###15 fluff pieces and these warm, fuzzy pieces about, oh, look
###19 how cute these animals are and isn't it cool
###21 that we could do this?
###22 And there's very little coverage, if any, of what it
###27 really meant to clone that animal and what it took.
###30 DR. DUANE KRAEMER: I think it more of reproduction.
###32 If we had created her, we'd have started from
###35 nothing and made her.
###37 But we started with ova from other cats and cells from
###42 another cat and just put them together in a way that they
###45 could reproduce.
###47 That's not vastly different than people
###50 that arrange for mating.
###50 It's just that we threw in some technology.

###76 DR. DUANE KRAEMER: I'm Duane Kraemer.
###78 I'm a professor at Texas A&M University.
###81 I've been working in the area of embryo transfer cloning and
###85 genetic engineering.
###86 
###92 My dream was to become a farmer.
###94 And I went to the university intending to just get what I
###99 needed to come back.
###100 And then I got bit by the research bug.
###103 My father was very disappointed that I didn't
###106 come back to the farm.
###108 My mother said, well, I knew you'd find something better.
###112 And I didn't mean that it was better, it was just different.
###118 Cloning, as it's most customarily practiced at the
###122 present, involves the transfer of nuclei from cells and
###127 transferring those cells into eggs where the nucleus has
###131 been removed, and then the nucleus from the animal to be
###134 cloned is put in its place.
###136 If it's a mammal, those new embryos then have to be
###140 transferred into recipient females for them
###144 to carry on to term.
###146 And usually, those recipient animals nurse them and raise
###150 them as well.
###151 
###155 This is the first of the deer to be cloned.
###158 This is Dewey.
###160 Students named him after me.
###162 I think it's because I insisted that he be allowed to
###166 be born natural birth.
###168 And he survived.
###169 I think that earned me that privilege, I guess.
###175 NINA MAK: The truth is that cloning is highly experimental
###178 and very problematic.
###180 And most of the time, it doesn't work.
###183 Only a few clones have actually been born
###185 successfully.
###186 And of the ones that have been, a good percentage
###189 actually end up dying within the first six months, because
###192 they have some sort of complication, health
###193 abnormality, a physical deformity,
###195 something like that.
###196 You talk about using a very large number of animals to
###199 even try to produce just one clone.
###203 DR. DUANE KRAEMER: Some people just don't like anything
###204 that's unnatural and think they can abide by that.
###210 But of course, most of the things they do are unnatural.
###213 I think it has to do with the Hollywood version, to some
###217 extent, of cloning.
###219 They have always pretty much made it a
###221 monster kind of activity.
###224 Well, I hope that there will be continued research to make
###228 it more dependable.
###231 At present, about 25% of offspring have some type of
###236 abnormality.
###237 They're developmental abnormalities.
###240 They're not mutations.
###241 They don't get passed on to the next generation.
###244 But they need special care.
###246 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###253 DR. DUANE KRAEMER: These are microscopes we
###255 use to find the eggs.
###258 We have to get the eggs out of ovaries.
###261 It is simple after you learn how to do it.
###264 But there are just many, many details
###268 that have to be followed.
###269 And if you do one thing wrong, then the chain is broken and
###275 you get nothing from it.
###278 Well, our team is working on a genetic engineering of
###281 livestock to produce animals that are resistant to disease.
###288 This is the cloned bull that's resistant to brucellosis,
###292 which is a disease that causes abortion in cattle and
###295 undulant fever in humans.
###298 The original bull was naturally resistant to it.
###300 His cells that were used for cloning him have been stored
###305 for 15 years.
###307 His name is Bruce after brucellosis.
###311 The process of selective breeding to produce superior
###314 individuals has been going on for many years, even using
###317 natural breeding.
###318 And then embryo transfer and artificial insemination made
###322 that process more efficient, where you could get more
###324 offspring from the genetically valuable animals.
###327 If they're superior and can't reproduce by themselves, then
###332 the techniques such as cloning can produce offspring.
###338 Anything we do could be used incorrectly and wrongly.
###344 And most things are by somebody somewhere, sometime.
###348 GEORGE W. BUSH: Chinese scientists have derived stem
###351 cells from cloned embryos created by combining human DNA
###357 and rabbit eggs.
###360 Others have announced plans to produce cloned children,
###365 despite the fact that laboratory cloning of animals
###368 has led to spontaneous abortions and terrible,
###371 terrible abnormalities.
###372 
###374 Human cloning is deeply troubling to
###377 me and to most Americans.
###380 DR. DUANE KRAEMER: The issue of human cell storage is one
###384 that we have not dealt with.
###386 We don't have any--
###387 don't even have my cells stored here.
###390 We have not worked at all with the human cells.
###394 Anyone who could effectively culture and preserve cells
###399 from animals would be able to do so with humans as well.
###402 
###405 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###408 DR. DUANE KRAEMER: I still get goose bumps
###410 when I see an embryo.
###411 It's just kind of thrilling to be able to see something as
###415 simple as a little embryo that you know can develop into
###418 something as complex as a complete individual.
###421 
###424 CC was, I think, a special cat, because she was the first
###428 of the pets to be cloned.
###429 
###432 It's not a new creation.
###434 We're just helping with reproduction.
###437 Cats had more to do with it than we did.
###438 It was their eggs that made it possible and the recipient
###442 that made it possible.
###443 I'm pleased with the result and pleased to have been a
###447 part of it.

###456 SHIRLEY KRAEMER: Come on over and meet those kitties.
###458 -Yeah.
###459 SHIRLEY KRAEMER: Yeah, come on over.
###460 -Grazie.
###460 SHIRLEY KRAEMER: Right over here's their house.
###462 
###465 DR. DUANE KRAEMER: She's up in that window.
###466 SHIRLEY KRAEMER: She's up in that window.
###467 And that's her favorite place.
###469 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###478 SHIRLEY KRAEMER: Hi, CC.
###478 Come on.
###478 Say hello, CC.
###480 Hi, Cece, how you doing?
###483 How you doing, CC?
###484 I worried when CC was expecting.
###487 I thought, oh, what if she's born with two children without
###490 ears and one without a tail?
###492 I'm going to have to say, oh, this is not good.
###494 But she came through for us.
###497 She came through.
###498 CC came through.
###499 CC's a good kitty.
###501 CC's a good kitty.
###502 She said, I know, I know.
###504 
###506 She knew exactly what to do.
###508 I really worried about that, because I thought, I'm going
###510 to have to buy little bottles and feed each kitten.
###513 No, I didn't have to.
###515 She was a wonderful mother.
###517 DR. DUANE KRAEMER: It's in the genes.
###518 SHIRLEY KRAEMER: It's in the genes.
###519 DR. DUANE KRAEMER: Different species have different
###520 instincts and behaviors.
###523 That's one thing about the clones.
###524 They all act like their own species.
###526 SHIRLEY KRAEMER: Species, yeah.
###528 DR. DUANE KRAEMER: It's a privilege to have been in a
###530 situation where we could do this and also to be able to
###533 enjoy her is an added privilege.
###539 If people want to use their resources to get a genetic
###543 copy of their original pet, I don't see
###546 anything wrong with that.
###547 NINA MAK: There's a life that gets lived-- a beginning,
###549 middle, and an end.
###550 And it's hard to deal with the end.
###553 But that's part of life.
###555 And trying to prevent that from being a part of life with
###558 this idea that you could somehow have the same animal
###560 your whole life--
###561 these are still animals, and they still very much matter.
###564 And to treat them like objects, it's not really
###571 something that I find acceptable.
###573 DR. DUANE KRAEMER: They say, accusatory, you're playing
###577 God, creating something.
###580 No more than anybody else is creating.
###583 Besides, I'm doing it to serve God, not to take his place.
###588 And I'm not playing.
###589 This is my vocation--
###592 work, but really good work.
###596 SHIRLEY KRAEMER: There you go, CC.
