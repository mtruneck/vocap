###25 'I wonder what kind of socks Sophie wears.
###28 'Do women wear socks? Well, yes, sometimes is the answer to that.
###32 'Socks before or after trousers, but never socks before pants - that's the rule.
###38 'Makes a man look scary, like a chicken. '
###42 'He just does not give one solitary shit. '
###47 'Yeah, take that, big Suze.
###49 'Your toilet-seat regime is over.
###52 'Ah, freedom! '
###55 'Brown for first course, white for pudding.
###58 'Brown is savoury, white's the treat. '
###61 'I'm the one who's laughing because I love brown toast. '
###65 'There he is. '
###67 - Dr J! - Good morning, Mark.
###70 Sorry I didn't hook up with you and Super Hans...
###73 - 'Wedge of ballast, then bed again. ' - Barbara pops up. "Is the file ready?"
###78 'It's a bit like the crusher in Star Wars but red hot.
###82 'What if Mum and Dad were trapped in one
###86 'and I had a hook to rescue one of them - who would I pick? '
###90 I didn't get a chance to tell you the good news.
###93 We need a clerical assistant and I've swung you an interview.
###97 - Uh-huh. - 'Clerical assistant?
###99 'I can't be a clerical assistant. I'm a musician.
###102 'You wouldn't ask the Chemical Brothers to do your laundry. '
###105 So is tomorrow at 11 all right?
###109 Tomorrow at 11. Yeah, sure. I'll set the video.
###112 - 'Don't joke. ' - 'I'm not. '
###114 It's a damn good company and it'll be the two of us together -
###118 Jez and Mez, the El Dude Brothers.
###121 It's just the music. It's really starting to hot up.
###125 You know how much I respect your music. It's just...
###128 Super Hans got a bass loop for our track that is so good
###132 that when he tried turning it off, he physically couldn't do it.
###136 I'm on your side. Every artist needs his patron
###141 but, you know, there's a limit.
###143 Oh. The rent.
###145 I'm not some kind of land baron trying to milk his cash cow.
###149 - It's just... - Don't worry, you'll get your milk.
###152 - This track's a banker. Somethin' Stupid)
###155 - Everybody needs a Somethin' Stupid. - Sorry?
###158 The guy who wrote that,
###160 he's probably up to his neck in penny loafers and blue pool tables.
###165 - Right. - Blimey, what's God up to?
###169 - 'So let's do just a... ' - Just in case the song doesn't work out,
###174 maybe you'd better fill this out and fax it over by three.
###177 Hmm.
###179 Think about it. And have a great day. Yeah?
###182 - See you tonight. - Yeah, cool. Have a good one.
###185 - You, too, mate. - Bye, mate.
###188 'Work-shy freeloader. '
###189 'Tight-fisted cock-muncher. '
###192 'Next time I have breakfast, he'll make me sit a fucking exam. '
###198 'I wonder what Sophie's flirty cartoon will be today? '
###202 - 'I really should ask her out for lunch. ' - Can you hold that?
###208 'You bastard. '
###211 Thanks Third floor?
###217 'I mean, what's the worst that could happen? She could say no. '
###221 'Actually, that would be terrible. It would destroy me if she said no. '
###226 There is a notice about only riding the lift to the first floor.
###230 You're wasting mine and other people's time, not to mention...
###234 Oh. Er, OK.
###237 'People like him should wear stickers. Their cars have them.
###241 'Oh, yeah. Great idea, Adolf. '
###243 - Morning, Mark. - Hey, Sophie.
###246 - 'Go on, ask her! ' - Sophie, are you...?
###248 I mean, would...?
###250 How's your day going thus far? Have a nice shower or bath?
###254 - Why? Do I smell? - God, no, you don't.
###257 I mean, you smell nice - not that I've smelt you.
###260 Oh... See ya.
###262 Later, potater.
###264 'Oh, potater. What have I become? '
###268 'Super Hans said he'll be here in 20 minutes. Means I've got an hour.
###273 'I bet Mark's got some porn here somewhere. '
###276 'OK, where's today's cartoon? '
###279 'Mm, not bad.
###281 'No discernible romantic overtones.
###284 'OK, pen, let's flirt with Sophie... '
###287 'Mark's got no conception. He thinks I'm so...
###291 'But I'm busting my creative balls here, day in, day out.
###295 'No, but it's all, "Where's the money? Where's my rent?
###298 "'The rent, Mr Jim Morrison? Mr Keats?"
###301 "'No, you don't like the attack dog, do you, Mr Keats?"
###305 'Hold on... I think I've struck the motherload! '
###310 'What the hell is that?
###312 'That is very gay. That's what that is.
###316 'Come on, go crazy! You're hungry like the wolf. '
###320 "'Fantasy Figure Modeller. "
###323 'Jesus. Maybe this is his porn. '
###326 'I'm giving her a love heart.
###328 'Yes, that's... good.
###330 'No, no, it's not good. It's terrible.
###334 'Think "crazy horse", think "in your face". What would Jeremy do?
###338 'Yeah, that's it.
###341 'Loves the Nazis. Yeah, crazy love.
###344 'Nazi love. I'm a nutter! '
###347 'I'm a dirty hobbit and she's a sexy elf
###351 'so she might be...
###353 "'Ohh! You dirty hobbit. Take off my bodkin and my jerkin. "
###358 'Oh, yeah...
###360 'Pixie ears.
###362 'But that sword. What if she was a hobbit slayer?
###365 'I'd just use my enchanted amulet.
###368 'Yeah. Yield to me, hobbit-slayer.
###372 'You will touch my magic cock. '
###376 '? And then I go and seal the deal
###378 '? By doing something wicked like this cartoon?
###383 'Swastika love.
###386 'It's bloody mental. '
###393 - So what do you think? - I dunno.
###395 - Yeah, it's zzzhhhh! In your face. - It's just...
###400 I don't like it.
###404 No, well, I do.
###405 - I just don't. - Oh, right. This is it, is it?
###408 - The end of the Hair Blair Bunch. - We are not the Hair Blair Bunch.
###412 - Whatever. Spunk Bubble. - Momma's Kumquat.
###416 No, it's not. I never agreed to it being Momma's Kumquat.
###419 Look, if this is John and Paul, 1970, then I need money for the equipment.
###426 This is like your whole Balearic bullshit, innit?
###429 One minute, it's all, "I love ya, man," the next, it's, "Where's that 50 quid?"
###434 - I'm just saying I need money... - Listen, mate.
###437 Shit is as shit does, my friend.
###442 Look, this is bullshit. We can't just let the Hair Blair Bunch go.
###447 We are not the Hair Blair Bunch!
###449 'A bloody swastika. That is the single worst single bloody idea ever.
###454 'I mean, a swastika!
###456 'It's gone. It's happened.
###459 'Oh, yeah, do what Jeremy would do. Thanks, Jeremy. You tit. '
###467 'Yeah, perfect plan. "I want to fax this off. Oh, Toni, I feel tired. "
###472 "'Let's just both lie down on your bed. "
###475 'Hope she gets out the bong, not the cafetiere. '
###477 I was wondering. You're an urban, switched-on lady.
###481 You've probably got a fax machine, right?
###484 A fax machine? Right, like I'd have a fax machine.
###487 Have you just come from the 1980s?
###490 It's like The Spaceman And King Arthur, but in reverse.
###495 Yeah. I've just got this crappy job application.
###498 Right. OK.
###502 Tell me something, Jeremy.
###505 Have you ever tried washing up without using washing-up liquid?
###508 What? Has Mark been talking to you?
###511 Could you clean a pot or a pan without using a scrubbing brush,
###516 a sponge or a scouring pad?
###519 - I don't think so. - So what you're saying is
###521 these products are essential - products no one could do without?
###526 Well, you're kind of making me say that but...
###530 The first thing to say is that this is definitely not pyramid selling, OK?
###537 Right. Good.
###540 What's pyramid selling?
###542 'Enter the pit of Sarlak, little crisps.
###545 'She's ignoring me.
###548 'Of course, she's ignoring me. I sent her a swastika.
###551 'Jesus! This is the worst thing to happen to anyone ever and...
###556 'Relax, Mark. You're not Hitler in his bunker.
###559 'He was really under the cosh.
###561 'Mind you, at least he had a girlfriend. OK, enough mooning.
###565 'Let's strap on the nosebag and eat some serious work. '
###568 I mean, does that look like a pyramid to you?
###571 Clearly, it's not a pyramid. It's a pie.
###574 And... it's like a big, lovely club with free money for everyone?
###580 - It sounds great, but... - Free money for everyone.
###583 Ha! Look out the window. That'll never happen in this old world.
###588 No, see, the early birds
###591 are going to find their bird table covered in money pie.
###598 - Right... - But the Johnny and Sally Come-Latelys,
###601 they get a slice of the pie but then they look closer
###604 and - oh, dear - it's only pastry.
###607 Boo-hoo, Johnny and Sally.
###610 Are you with me?
###613 'Blown it with Sophie. Who's next?
###616 'Big Suze?
###618 'Never met her. Not necessarily a disadvantage.
###621 'Why don't I ever get this fucking thing fixed?!
###625 'Every night... Ah, it always comes out eventually. Fuck it. '
###631 - Hey, Mark. Liked the cartoon. - Oh, I'm so... You did?
###636 Yeah, it's meant to be me and Barbara from Personnel, right?
###640 And... she's handing me this heart of holiday pay
###643 but in the heart, it's just...
###647 - Race hate? - Exactly.
###650 That's so Barbara. She's such a racist.
###653 Huh, huh. Right. Exactly.
###656 Listen, Sophie, I was wondering if I could get your home number.
###660 I mean, for work, in case I need to swap a shift or... That is, if you don't...
###665 No, I don't, if that's what you want.
###667 'She's actually writing it. '
###671 There you go. See you later.
###674 Oh, hang on. This isn't enough numbers.
###678 Oh, no, it is enough numbers.
###681 'Oh, God, I hope she doesn't mind about my balls. '
###685 'One step out of line. The slightest hint of maverick behaviour and you're out. '
###690 Exactly. If it's such a bad thing to do things by the book, there'd be no book.
###695 'Must keep an eye on him if he gets it. JLB doesn't need a maverick. '
###700 - So anyway, things went rather well - - I bet he did it.
###705 Oh, what? Just because he's black?
###707 No, I mean, not because...
###710 - He was at the garage at the beginning. - I know what you meant.
###713 Anyway, in the end, I got Sophie's number.
###717 We know he's the only one with the key to the lock-up.
###720 So do you think I should give her a call? I probably should.
###724 - I don't know if I should. - Maybe you should.
###727 OK, listen, if God's doing mountains or sky or water, I'll call.
###733 - If he's doing trees or critters, I won't. - All right, let God decide. Ready?
###739 Yeah, sky!
###741 Right, here goes.
###744 'And with a large brush, I'm gonna... '
###747 'The following names were presented to us by temping agencies. '
###753 - Answerphone. - Ah, you see!
###756 He did do it, but for a nice reason.
###758 Who's the racist now, Mark?
###761 Er, Sophie. If you heard that, please ignore it. I'm not a racist.
###765 Far from it.
###767 Anyway...
###769 It's good to hear your voice. I know it's only a recording
###773 but you have got a bloody nice voice
###777 and...
###780 God, I just called up to say hi and then...
###784 ? Then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like...
###790 ? I like you?
###792 I mean, not that.
###794 But anyway...
###797 I noticed that the paper in the photocopier is running a bit low so...
###802 I know it's not really your job but...
###804 You know, so... See you tomorrow.
###808 Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
###809 - Oh, fuck! - Oh, my God.
###811 - Jesus! - I've really fucked it. Have I fucked it?
###814 Maybe it was charming.
###816 - It was the behaviour of an oddball. - No, not an oddball. A maverick.
###821 You may not play by the rules, but...
###823 by Christ, you get results.
###825 Come on, let's go and have a drink. Forget about it.
###829 Have you forgotten about the phone call yet?
###832 - No. - Right.
###835 How much washing-up do you think you could do without washing-up liquid?
###840 - I'm sorry? - Exactly. And friends and colleagues?
###845 Everyone needs cleaning products
###847 and that's never gonna change, right?
###850 - Why are you talking like this? - Very interesting question.
###854 The first thing to say is that this is not pyramid selling.
###858 - You're doing pyramid selling? - Not pyramid selling.
###861 - I can't believe you're pyramid selling. - Listen, it's not, it's network marketing
###867 and it's a guaranteed money-making...
###870 - I've seen the charts. - Oh, the charts.
###873 - You didn't tell me about the charts! - Are you trying to piss on my bonfire?
###878 I'm trying to protect you from...
###881 pissing all over yourself.
###883 I'm not about to piss all over myself. I'm...
###887 I'm pissing... into the big time.
###890 - You're still coming to the interview. - Well, I thought...
###894 Listen, Jeremy. You don't understand. Nothing you want will ever happen.
###899 That's the real world. Your hair isn't red. People don't walk on stilts.
###904 Maybe somewhere, you can earn a living drinking margaritas through a straw
###909 but in this world, you've got to turn up, log on and grind out.
###912 But if you get in early...
###914 Come Friday, you will owe me three months' rent.
###918 You're coming to the interview.
###920 OK.
###922 'I'll come to the interview, all right, but I won't be getting the job. '
###927 What?
###929 Er, nothing, just...
###931 something funny.
###933 Can you...?
###946 'Maybe she did find it charming. Yeah, maybe.
###949 'Just work out her... I could say Jeremy had a gun and made me sing it
###955 'because he's a crackhead and he does that all the time.
###958 'Yeah, that sounds great - me in my crack house. You can be a crack bitch
###963 'and sit on my... Shit!
###965 'Shit, piss, poo, pants, bollocks. Yes, blitzkrieg! I'm in the Ardennes!
###969 'You can't touch me in the Ardennes, concealed in the cupboard.
###974 'Everything's OK in the cupboard. I'm safe in the cupboard. '
###979 Mark?
###981 - You're in the stationery cupboard. - That's right, Jeff.
###985 OK... Right.
###988 Well...
###990 - I hope you're having a good time. - Yeah, well...
###993 Hi, Mark.
###995 Hi... Sophie.
###997 I'm just in the cupboard right now.
###1000 - About the message, we'll talk later, OK? - Er, yeah, fine.
###1012 'Here we go. Operation Come Over Like An Unemployable Freak. '
###1017 Jeremy Osbourne?
###1019 Hi, I'm Barbara. Do you want to walk this way?
###1022 Right you are.
###1024 I might wobble because I'm a bit pissed from last night
###1028 and I don't want to get your hopes up cos I must say...
###1031 - I'm only really here because... - Obviously you know Mark Corrigan.
###1036 - 'Oh, shit. ' - Mark would be one of your managers.
###1040 'Must be careful. Don't want the job or to piss off the land baron. '
###1044 'He looks like crap. '
###1047 We have to make sure we've ticked all the boxes, so to speak
###1051 and kept everything above board.
###1053 So if I can outline the basic requirements of the role you'll be undertaking.
###1058 You'll be responsible for updating and maintaining the filing system.
###1063 That may not sound important but the truth is...
###1067 'Shit, what's she talking about? Nod. Look serious.
###1071 'I'm Di, she's Bashir. '
###1073 ...whole company communicates...
###1076 'He'll be able to pay off the Blockbusters fine,
###1079 'plus I'll be able to order him around.
###1082 'Not horrible, just... "Jeremy, could you file this for me?
###1086 "'Jeremy, could you take that for me?
###1088 "'Jeremy, could you suck this for me... " Jesus! Where did that come from? '
###1093 It's a valuable asset. Do you have any experience in this field?
###1097 Er, I've done quite a lot, actually.
###1099 I mean, not formal filing but alphabeti-pi-cising the videos,
###1103 doing the spices...
###1106 I'd want to build on that experience in a professional zone.
###1109 Sphere. I meant sphere.
###1112 'God, that sounded amazing! Don't accidentally get the bugger. '
###1116 We're doing great.
###1120 So, I see you used to be a nurse.
###1123 Wouldn't filing be a bit of a step down?
###1126 Yeah, I suppose it would, actually,
###1129 although I'm looking for something more relaxing.
###1133 Challenging. He means, challenging.
###1135 - I expect Jeremy knows what he means. - Yes, right.
###1139 No, challenging is right
###1141 but a bit more of a relaxing challenge.
###1145 More like doing a crossword than a tracheotomy.
###1149 - Right. - 'Oh, shit.
###1151 'My natural bloody charm's only swinging it. Got to do something. '
###1157 - Are you OK? - What?
###1159 - It's just a thing I have. - What thing?
###1162 Facial spasming.
###1164 Facial spa... You do not have...
###1167 - I do... sometimes. - Well, er...
###1170 I guess that's everything. Jeremy, is there anything you'd like to ask?
###1175 Yes, Barbara. Yes, there is.
###1177 How much washing-up do you think you could do without any washing-up liquid?
###1182 - No, Jeremy. - Where's this...?
###1185 - It's a unique business opportunity. - It's pyramid selling.
###1190 - It's not pyramid selling, Mark. - It is.
###1192 - You're making a fool of yourself. - You're pissing on my bonfire!
###1195 - There is no bonfire! - Because you keep pissing on it!
###1198 Sheesh. This is low. This is really low.
###1201 Yeah, well, at least I don't fancy elves and pixies.
###1205 What does that mean? I literally have no idea what that is supposed to mean!
###1210 OK...
###1212 Well, thanks for coming in. We'll be in touch.
###1217 'Well, that was a fucking disaster. I want reparations - brutal reparations!
###1223 'I want the Rhineland. It's going to be 1919 all over again.
###1227 'Fuck the inevitable backlash!
###1230 'OK. It's OK, Mark. Later.
###1232 'Now, calm.
###1235 'Calm, honest and mature. '
###1237 Hi, Sophie.
###1239 Hey, Mark. I just bumped into your flatmate.
###1242 - Oh... yeah? - He kept talking about washing up.
###1245 - Very funny. Like Jim Carrey. - Huh. Yeah, I know what you mean.
###1250 'Get your tanks off my lawn, Jeremy. '
###1252 But listen, Sophie...
###1254 About the message last night. I want to kind of come clean really.
###1260 It's a bit embarrassing but...
###1265 Well...
###1267 the thing is...
###1269 Jeremy, sometimes, for a laugh, makes me say things with a bread knife.
###1274 - He's obviously not a crackhead but... - Uh-huh. OK.
###1277 Yeah.
###1280 Look, you don't have to... About the phone message,
###1283 - you don't have to be embarrassed. - I don't?
###1286 - No, it's just one of those things. - Is it? It is?
###1290 Oh, right. Fantastic.
###1292 And... you haven't told anyone about it?
###1295 Of course not.
###1297 - Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. - 'Calm down. She's not Pontius Pilate. '
###1302 Yeah, well, you know...
###1303 The truth is...
###1305 The truth is I suppose...
###1307 I like you.
###1309 That's why I said the song. I like you.
###1313 Is that such a crime?
###1315 Should I be hounded to the ends of the earth just for liking you?
###1319 I like you and if you can't handle it, you can just...
###1323 you know...
###1325 fuck off.
###1327 No, no, I think I can handle you liking me.
###1330 Good.
###1332 Right, excellent. OK.
###1339 Bye.
###1350 Hi, Mark. Thanks for bringing in Jeremy.
###1352 He was quite the find.
###1354 Er, yeah...
###1356 Right, I'm really sorry. I mean, I thought it would be a good...
###1361 that he might... but...
###1364 Hey! Hey, there!
###1366 Feeling better now, are we? Fully recovered?
###1369 Hey, I see you!
###1371 I see you!
###1373 He used to have a limp!
###1376 I mean, he pretended to have a limp.
###1378 He's a faking little pegleg!
###1393 Hi, Jeff.
###1396 'Well, fuck you if you're not doing small talk. I'm not helping.
###1400 'Let's die together. '
###1405 ? And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like
###1411 ? I like you?
###1415 ? And then I go and spoil it all
###1417 ? By saying something stupid like I love you
###1424 ? I can see it in your eyes that you despise the same old lies
###1429 ? You heard the night before
###1434 ? And though it's just a line to you For me, it's true
###1438 ? And never seems so...?
