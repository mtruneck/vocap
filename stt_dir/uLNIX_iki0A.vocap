###4 CHARLENE: Welcome to "Fashion Week International," the show
###8 that reports on the most fabulous fashion weeks in the
###10 world, and the culture and politics behind them.
###14 This time we're in Kingston, Jamaica, for
###17 Caribbean Fashion Week.
###18 
###22 
###36 [MUSIC  PLAYING]
###46 CHARLENE: In June 2012, Caribbean Fashion Week
###50 descended on Kingston, Jamaica.
###52 Although Jamaica might not be known for catwalk couture,
###55 reggae and dancehall style have
###57 become a worldwide export.
###62 CHARLENE: Whilst dancehall parties are probably the best
###65 parties in the world, they're also the place where you'll
###67 find some unusual beauty trends,
###70 including skin bleaching.
###72 
###81 CHARLENE: And girls ingesting agricultural chicken feed to
###84 get a bigger ass.
###86 
###92 CHARLENE: Welcome to Caribbean Fashion Week.
###95 
###106 [KIDS SINGING]
###118 CHARLENE: Caribbean Fashion Week has been running for the
###120 last 12 years, mainly without a hitch, with the exception of
###124 2010 when the whole event had to be to postponed due to a
###127 small war being fought between the army and local hero/drug
###131 lord, Dudus Coke.
###133 
###135 This year's fashion week was going ahead without a drugs
###138 war in sight at the National Sports Center in New Kingston.
###143 The problem with sports centers, is that no matter how
###146 much hotel furniture and DHL fashions stalls you set up,
###150 it's always going to look like a sports center.
###154 Once the show is actually started, the gorgeous models
###157 definitely had their own way of working the runway to an
###160 eclectic soundtrack of Skrillex and Bob Marley.
###164 However, it wasn't until the fashion stopped and the
###167 after-show entertainment began that the
###169 catwalk really blew up.
###170 
###174 [MUSIC - CONSCIOUS]
###178 CHARLENE: As local dancehall artist and heartthrob
###181 Conscious took to the catwalk, the previously prim girls on
###185 the front row summarily transformed into insatiable
###188 dancehall queens.
###191 In Kingston, dancehall nightlife is omnipotent.
###195 You can rave every night of the week if you want at
###198 imaginatively named parties such as Mojito Monday, Nipples
###203 Tuesday, Weddy Weddy Wednesday, and so on.
###208 To find out more, we were going to meet a man who, to
###211 describe as an authority on the subject of dancehall,
###213 would be an understatement.
###216 We just spontaneously were told we had an interview with
###219 Elephant Man.
###220 And I was like, yeah, cool.
###222 Let's do it.
###223 And then when we walked in and I met him and I shook his
###226 hand, I became completely overwhelmed and I dissolved.
###231 MAN: Love this!
###233 
###273 CHARLENE: Yes, pretty man.
###274 
###276 CHARLENE: I wore them just for you.
###278 
###297 CHARLENE: And what about trends like skin bleaching?
###301 
###320 CHARLENE: What for you is the essence of Jamaican beauty?
###323 
###342 CHARLENE: How are you going to stay fresh?
###344 
###379 CHARLENE: Back at the party, it was easy to see why some of
###382 these girls might cause the men some problems.
###385 Their outfits made their bodies pop in
###387 all the right places.
###389 However, it was hard to ignore an unnatural paleness on some
###393 of their faces.
###394 
###396 Skin bleaching is a controversial topic
###398 all over the world.
###400 But Jamaica is the only country where it has become a
###402 subject immortalized in song with popular dancehall stars
###406 such as Vybz Kartel endorsing it.
###409 
###426 CHARLENE: However, this is not the only DIY beauty treatment
###429 causing a stir, as we'd find out the next day.
###432 [MUSIC  PLAYING]
###448 CHARLENE: So we're coming to look at this private farm in
###452 someone's backyard.
###453 A poultry farmer.
###454 Now, this is obviously not entirely fashion-related, but
###458 you'll see.
###460 Hi.
###463 We were here to find out about an underground trend that
###466 started in Jamaica in the '90s of girls consuming
###469 agricultural chicken feed in the hope of
###472 obtaining curvier bodies.
###473 
###476 Colloquially known as fowl pills, they might contain
###479 anything from growth hormones to appetite stimulants.
###482 And one of the key ingredients is arsenic.
###485 Yummy.
###486 
###489 CHARLENE: How many do you have?
###490 
###507 CHARLENE: You're going to end up as KFC, my friend.
###510 
###513 
###528 CHARLENE: So girls put this in their porridge?
###532 CHARLENE: And it helps them get
###534 bigger, just like a chicken?
###535 
###539 CHARLENE: As this is an underground phenomenon,
###541 there's no actual proof that this plumps girls' breasts and
###544 buttocks the way it does chickens.
###548 
###556 CHARLENE: What's nice about fat?
###558 
###589 CHARLENE: Why is it better to be bigger in Jamaica?
###591 
###613 CHARLENE: Another thing, since I've been here, one of the
###615 fashion is bleaching skin.
###618 
###636 
###660 CHARLENE: Do you bleach?
###663 BOY: Yeah.
###664 CHARLENE: Yeah?
###664 When did you start?
###666 
###670 CHARLENE: It's bad for your skin?
###673 
###679 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###686 CHARLENE: As usual, fashion week was bucking the trend on
###689 the street.
###690 But if eating chicken pill porridge for breakfast was one
###692 of them, then it's probably best left on the street.
###697 I wanted to ask the models what they thought of these
###699 trends, if indeed they'd heard of them.
###702 
###715 
###725 
###774 CHARLENE: General opinion seemed to suggest that this
###777 was a matter of economics and education, as these practices
###780 are popular in low-income areas.
###783 My questioning was eventually overwhelmed by the
###786 excruciatingly loud Europop, so we left fashion week and
###790 headed back to a dancehall party.
###791 
###796 [MUSIC - LISA HYPER, "BLEACHING FIT ME"]
###797 
###805 CHARLENE: I'd heard dancehall superstar Lisa Hype was going
###808 to be at the party.
###809 She was a protege of Vybz Kartel's and fellow bleaching
###813 advocate, so I was keen to talk to her.
###816 [MUSIC - LISA HYPER, "BLEACHING FIT ME"]
###817 
###826 CHARLENE: The dancehall may initially seem intimidating,
###829 like walking into an exclusive club where everyone dances
###832 better and is hotter than you.
###834 
###836 But on closer inspection, you realize this is an arena that
###839 welcomes all sorts, just as long as you get involved.
###844 [MUSIC - LISA HYPER, "BLEACHING FIT ME"]
###845 
###850 CHARLENE: We make plans to meet Lisa the next day.
###852 In most countries, a celebrity turning up at a nightclub
###856 causes a scene.
###857 Not here.
###858 I was surprised Lisa's presence didn't cause some
###861 sort of hysteria, but not half as surprised by
###864 what happened next.
###866 King of the dancehall, Beenie Man, strolled in to break the
###869 news of the death of his father to the
###872 unsuspecting crowd.
###874 
###911 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###918 
###922 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###943 CHARLENE: So we've come this lovely house on the outskirts
###946 of Kingston for a photo shoot for Lisa Hyper's album.
###951 Lisa Hyper is one of the biggest female dancehall stars
###955 at the moment.
###955 She started out as one of Vybz Kartel's proteges, and since
###959 he's been in prison she's trying to reinvent itself.
###963 Obviously, she's one of the most influential female stars
###966 of the moment, but one of the main reasons I want to talk to
###968 her is because she's one of the few stars that advocated
###972 skin bleaching.
###973 
###976 LISA HYPER: [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]
###977 
###1000 CHARLENE: Obviously, here, fashion is so
###1003 tied up with music.
###1004 LISA HYPER: Yes
###1006 CHARLENE: How do you feel now about being a role model to
###1009 young girls in Jamaica?
###1010 How do you feel about that responsibility?
###1013 
###1034 CHARLENE: People overseas are obsessed with the fact that
###1037 everyone is bleaching their skin.
###1039 Do you still bleach?
###1041 
###1048 CHARLENE: Yeah?
###1049 LISA HYPER: Yeah, I still do.
###1050 CHARLENE: And can you explain for us why it's so popular
###1053 here, because I think there's a lot of ignorance and a lot
###1056 of people don't--
###1057 
###1089 CHARLENE: I mean, for some young girls I think because
###1092 the processes is not monitored, you can't go and
###1098 safely buy the cream and there's no real instructions
###1101 because there's no education around it, do you think it
###1104 would be better if there was--
###1108 somewhere it was more regulated so that--
###1112 LISA HYPER: Yes.
###1112 CHARLENE: --people weren't hurting themselves.
###1113 
###1127 CHARLENE: Lisa seemed uncomfortable
###1129 with the term, bleaching.
###1131 Many people here prefer to sugar coat the trend by
###1134 referring to it as rubbings or toning the skin, making it
###1139 sound more like a health treatment at a beauty spa.
###1143 CHILD: Come watch me.
###1146 [CHILDREN SINGING]
###1154 CHARLENE: After meeting Lisa, someone who grew up in the
###1157 ghetto and is so influential there, I wanted to talk to
###1161 some young girls from there for whom the bleaching trend
###1163 is a part of everyday life.
###1165 
###1170 So that one is when you're at your whitest?
###1172 
###1180 CHARLENE: So that's like the lightest you got?
###1182 
###1185 CHARLENE: At what age?
###1187 
###1191 CHARLENE: Did people tell you that you shouldn't do it?
###1193 It's dangerous for your health?
###1195 
###1200 CHARLENE: And who are the people that say that?
###1202 
###1211 CHARLENE: That's how I clean my bath.
###1213 
###1221 CHARLENE: Do you think, also, the popularity of having
###1225 lighter skin comes from the media?
###1227 
###1240 CHARLENE: So what is this chicken pill?
###1243 
###1246 CHARLENE: And it works the same you think for humans?
###1251 GROUP OF WOMEN: Yeah.
###1253 CHARLENE: Peritol.
###1255 The pills they showed me had Peritol stamped on them.
###1259 These have nothing to do with chickens.
###1262 Peritol is actually an appetite stimulant for
###1264 depressed cats.
###1266 Chicken pills seems to be an umbrella term for any
###1269 under-the-counter pharmaceutical that may help
###1272 you gain weight.
###1274 Some girls aren't too worried about what they are putting in
###1276 their bodies if there's a chance it'll bring them closer
###1278 to their ideal look.
###1281 
###1314 CHARLENE: So what happens?
###1316 Where do you get the pills?
###1317 
###1345 CHARLENE: The girls then took us into downtown Kingston so
###1348 we could see just how easy it was to get hold
###1351 of bleaching products.
###1353 So where are we going now?
###1354 
###1368 CHARLENE: We are in Kevin's Haberdashery and this is where
###1372 the girls buy their bleaching cream.
###1375 How do you know what you're buying?
###1377 There are so many different types.
###1379 
###1386 CHARLENE: What do you mean by risk?
###1389 
###1401 CHARLENE: Because it's kind of a bit illegal.
###1404 You can't just go and ask the doctor what to do, you have to
###1407 try yourself.
###1409 
###1413 CHARLENE: I'm looking at Vybz's own brand cake soap.
###1416 WOMAN: [UNINTELLIGIBLE] cake soap.
###1417 CHARLENE: Is it-- does it work?
###1419 
###1422 CHARLENE: Really?
###1424 
###1432 CHARLENE: So we just kind of followed the girls into the
###1435 place where they buy the bleaching cream, and I was
###1438 quite surprised to see it all on display because from what
###1440 I've heard, I thought it was kind of more of an
###1443 under-the-counter thing because it's not legal.
###1445 So we were OK for a while and then once the people who
###1448 worked there realized that we were filming, they asked us to
###1450 stop because they thought we were going to expose them.
###1454 So we've had to step outside.
###1458 
###1464 CHARLENE: We managed to find a vendor of lightening products
###1466 who agreed to talk to me about it.
###1470 Generally, like any other accessory fashion store that I
###1473 might find in the world.
###1476 Except that you sell bleaching cream just like
###1480 it's another accessory.
###1482 What is it about being lighter at the moment that is more
###1486 attractive?
###1488 
###1491 VENDOR: Hmm.
###1492 
###1509 CHARLENE: Despite the risk of atrophy, stretch marks,
###1512 chemical burns, and acne, not to mention the long-term
###1516 systemic health effects such as Cushing's syndrome and
###1519 diabetes, many girls and boys continue to bleach in the name
###1523 of fashion.
###1525 The girls we'd met were unwilling to actually apply it
###1528 in front of us, so we headed to one of Kingston's premier
###1532 strip clubs, Caesar's, to meet a girl who would.
###1537 So the girls that we spoke to before, they were really open
###1541 about skin bleaching and they let us talk about it for ages.
###1545 When it came down to actually showing us how the process is
###1549 done, they were a bit uncomfortable doing it.
###1551 So, we've been put in touch with a girl who works here.
###1556 This is a strip club in Kingston called Caesar's.
###1560 I've got to tell you, she's not a stripper,
###1562 she's only a hostess.
###1564 But she's going to show us and hopefully give us some further
###1567 insight into why girls bleach.
###1571 What do the men here want?
###1573 
###1578 Who are these girls here?
###1580 
###1587 CHARLENE: So is this kind of what the demand is,
###1591 lighter-skinned girls?
###1592 
###1621 CHARLENE: So using skin bleachers is logical, really.
###1625 It makes sense--
###1626 
###1665 CHARLENE: Interesting.
###1666 Do you ever think about it, and just wish that it was
###1669 different and the trend was to be black?
###1673 
###1681 CHARLENE: She took us into one of the back rooms usually
###1683 reserved for more amorous encounters where she could
###1686 demonstrate her bleaching technique.
###1690 So show me what you do.
###1692 HOSTESS: All right.
###1694 
###1741 CHARLENE: What do you think would happen if I used it?
###1742 
###1745 
###1776 CHARLENE: Shall I try?
###1778 
###1781 CHARLENE: It's definitely a little bit warm.
###1784 HOSTESS: Yeah.
###1785 
###1792 CHARLENE: So you would go out with this under your clothes?
###1795 All day?
###1796 
###1812 CHARLENE: If you have a boyfriend already, doesn't it
###1814 interfere with your sex life?
###1816 
###1819 CHARLENE: What's more important?
###1820 Sex or bleaching?
###1822 
###1840 CHARLENE: And even in summer, like how it is now--
###1843 
###1860 CHARLENE: Some of the beauty trends we've seen here may
###1862 appear extreme, but when put up against permatanning and
###1865 plastic surgery, it's just another example of the theory
###1869 that making our self darker, lighter, fatter, or thinner,
###1873 is going to radically alter your fortune.
###1875 
###1878 Fashion week had definitely been a celebration of the more
###1881 positive side of Jamaican fashion, but I think couture
###1885 will have a tough job taking over from dancehall as the
###1887 flagship of Jamaican style.
###1891 And a good thing, too.
###1893 [MUSIC PLAYING]
