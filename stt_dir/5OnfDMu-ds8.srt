1
0:0:2,419 --> 0:0:9,69
To a working system, that’s beneficial to
most people. Now you can be so aberrated that


2
0:0:9,69 --> 0:0:16,199
you can’t see the benefits of the system.
Can you understand that? You can be - it’s


3
0:0:16,199 --> 0:0:23,539
like the Jews going to the Nazis for free
money to expand Jewish knowledge. Now, you


4
0:0:23,539 --> 0:0:29,949
know what a real, in the old days, liberal
 - a liberal can’t go to a clan meeting


5
0:0:29,949 --> 0:0:36,569
and say “you guys are ridiculous” he can
talk to them, but he can’t talk to them,


6
0:0:36,569 --> 0:0:44,44
he’ll talk at them. They won’t hear a
word he says, because they listen as a clans


7
0:0:44,44 --> 0:0:51,139
man with those tools. Is man a reasoning animal?
He can’t be because he couldn’t change


8
0:0:51,139 --> 0:0:59,859
then. If he’s subject to change then he
can’t have a fixed set of values, you know


9
0:0:59,859 --> 0:1:5,75
what that means? These are very tough things,
you have to think about them a lot, toss them


10
0:1:5,75 --> 0:1:12,119
around, meaning, listen to normal people,
see if there’s any signal in what they say.


11
0:1:12,119 --> 0:1:22,159
Except “I like being with you” that means,
they’re not dissatisfied. But you must provide


12
0:1:22,159 --> 0:1:33,64
tools and to tell people that they need tools,
they take as an insult “who the hell are


13
0:1:33,64 --> 0:1:40,79
you to tell me what I need?” You understand?
The ego becomes involved because they think


14
0:1:40,79 --> 0:1:45,85
you’re downing them. You know what that
means? You’re not downing them, you’re


15
0:1:45,85 --> 0:1:54,369
trying to equip them, with better tools. There’s
a glass cleaner that’s available called


16
0:1:54,369 --> 0:1:59,369
‘transparent glass’ are you familiar with
it? You rub it on your windshield and you


17
0:1:59,369 --> 0:2:7,409
can’t see the glass. It deflects light in
such a way that the glass looks like there’s


18
0:2:7,409 --> 0:2:14,94
no glass there. It’s called transparent
fluid, which they use on optics now on cameras.


19
0:2:14,94 --> 0:2:23,99
But it’s temporary, it then fogs up a little.
But anyway, with the advent of science and


20
0:2:23,99 --> 0:2:28,15
technology say assume we don’t kill each
other we live another thousand years, the


21
0:2:28,15 --> 0:2:37,39
average person, it’s not just a laptop but
it’s what it does that’s - you can turn


22
0:2:37,39 --> 0:2:43,459
pages of a book you can move it with your
fingers, it’s doing so many new things which


23
0:2:43,459 --> 0:2:49,9
invite thousands of other new things especially
if people are in the business of making new


24
0:2:49,9 --> 0:2:57,319
things. So the exponential curve will go very
sharp leaving people behind continuously,


25
0:2:57,319 --> 0:3:7,209
that’s why an IQ test has nothing to do
with anything except your responses in relation


26
0:3:7,209 --> 0:3:18,37
to a fixed set of conditions. IQ does not
measure intelligence. You may have neurons,


27
0:3:18,37 --> 0:3:25,189
neurotransmitters more than the other person
has and you might remember more but that doesn’t


28
0:3:25,189 --> 0:3:33,159
make you better. If you’re a specialist
say psychologist and you study human behavior


29
0:3:33,159 --> 0:3:43,54
how can you study human behavior without studying
the monetary system? You know what I mean?


30
0:3:43,54 --> 0:4:7,12
So you tell ‘em to give a little, she’ll
give a little, you know? Shit like that. Gotta


31
0:4:7,12 --> 0:4:17,12
get a drink. If you know psychologists or
a neurologist, you ask ’em what does their


32
0:4:17,12 --> 0:4:21,16
profession do? Well, it tries to adjust people
so they can respond to the culture, that would


33
0:4:21,16 --> 0:4:33,16
be insane. Do you know what I mean? Do you
know what I’m talking about? A psychologist


34
0:4:33,16 --> 0:4:39,76
would have to ask other questions “what
is it I want? What is it that I want? I want


35
0:4:39,76 --> 0:4:51,41
a flexibility in human behavior” but a flexibility
that doesn’t bring any money in might make


36
0:4:51,41 --> 0:5:0,64
the person a hobo. You know what I mean? Normal
people have ideas of well adjusted person,


37
0:5:0,64 --> 0:5:8,35
a well adjusted Indian is a well adjusted
Indian, a well adjusted Mexican is a well


38
0:5:8,35 --> 0:5:15,73
adjusted Mexican, but there’s no such thing
as well adjusted people. Do you know what


39
0:5:15,73 --> 0:5:23,48
that means? So trying to be well adjusted
is updating your tools. Well adjusted to change.


40
0:5:23,48 --> 0:5:34,94
Yeah. If you know what that means. So, the
problems become more difficult with this system


41
0:5:34,94 --> 0:5:44,75
to change people, they don’t even know they
need change. I think when the laptop came


42
0:5:44,75 --> 0:5:52,21
out you had to show people what it does, they
didn’t just sit there and do it. When something


43
0:5:52,21 --> 0:6:4,3
new comes out they show you what it does and
they say “oh these are new tools” so.


44
0:6:4,3 --> 0:6:15,14
Now if a guy lives in the south seas learning
celestial mechanics or high level mathematics,


45
0:6:15,14 --> 0:6:23,24
there’s no use for it out there if he’s
a native. That’s information superfluous


46
0:6:23,24 --> 0:6:31,36
to his needs. You know what that means? If
you teach a native - primitive person, biological


47
0:6:31,36 --> 0:6:40,91
systems, it might be superfluous to his lifestyle
there, you know what that means? Ok. I would


48
0:6:40,91 --> 0:6:49,21
imagine that if there is such a thing as advanced
people out in the universe I don’t believe


49
0:6:49,21 --> 0:6:55,89
they would communicate with us. I don’t
believe they would even try. I don’t believe


50
0:6:55,89 --> 0:7:1,53
they’d have “well let’s give ‘em a
hand” I don’t think they’d think that


51
0:7:1,53 --> 0:7:8,88
way. It’s like you and ants, you know what
I mean? Humans think that they would welcome


52
0:7:8,88 --> 0:7:17,71
a new civilisation. so you don’t think we’d
be of interest. I don’t think so, how could


53
0:7:17,71 --> 0:7:25,39
we be of interest? We can’t say anything
new, especially if they land in the south


54
0:7:25,39 --> 0:7:31,35
specific and they meet the natives and the
natives say “the volcanoes angry” what


55
0:7:31,35 --> 0:7:39,4
can they do with that? They can leave the
area or, I don’t even think they’d know,


56
0:7:39,4 --> 0:7:44,98
they’d know the guy has primitive associations,
and they wouldn’t have to ask him anything


57
0:7:44,98 --> 0:7:50,41
alls they have to do is watch our TV shows,
which they watch for 2 seconds, “what a


58
0:7:50,41 --> 0:8:0,24
bunch of shit” I don’t think they’d
say that but, it’s very hard - people say


59
0:8:0,24 --> 0:8:6,0
to me “will people be happier in the future?”
they’re using today's standards with the


60
0:8:6,0 --> 0:8:13,9
future. It isn’t happiness that people need,
it’s security and evaluation of the real


61
0:8:13,9 --> 0:8:20,67
world, that brings equilibrium, and to the
extent that your notions about the world are


62
0:8:20,67 --> 0:8:29,42
unreal, you will suffer. I would say, I think
you told me that your father used to beat


63
0:8:29,42 --> 0:8:37,31
your mother, that was the best tools he had,
getting mad at him does not give him new tools


64
0:8:37,31 --> 0:8:43,259
and when he doesn’t say “what do you think
I ought to do?” that would be rare, I don’t


65
0:8:43,259 --> 0:8:58,19
think he’d ever say that to you, would he?
“What do you think I ought to do?” He


66
0:8:58,19 --> 0:8:59,93
doesn’t even have that in his head. I gave
him that opportunity one time and he rejected


67
0:8:59,93 --> 0:9:2,269
 - I didn’t speak to him in 2 years. Yeah,
but that’s because you believe that people


68
0:9:2,269 --> 0:9:9,199
can think and reason, only if you give them
the tools, that takes time for the tools to


69
0:9:9,199 --> 0:9:18,0
gel too. You just can’t hand people tools
they won’t even know what it is. You know


70
0:9:18,0 --> 0:9:26,29
what a stage is on a microscope? You can move
the film minuet quantities of distance that


71
0:9:26,29 --> 0:9:30,79
you’re looking at the specimen can be turned
to the right, where you have to turn it 50


72
0:9:30,79 --> 0:9:38,98
times to move it 1000th of an inch. So if
you’re looking at bacteria that’s extensional,


73
0:9:38,98 --> 0:9:45,959
so again, all extensional devices change,
that’s why you can never become sane. You


74
0:9:45,959 --> 0:9:53,4
can never become well adjusted, you know what
I mean? If all things keep changing how can


75
0:9:53,4 --> 0:10:0,0
you become sane? And sane means, you’re
sane, that can’t be, because there’s so


76
0:10:0,0 --> 0:10:6,42
much we don’t know, we can become saner,
but never sane. Do you know what that means?


77
0:10:6,42 --> 0:10:17,319
You mean define sane? what’s that? Can you
define sane? can’t hear ya. Define sane.


78
0:10:17,319 --> 0:10:23,439
Sane meaning, the most operant behavior to
fit a given set of circumstances. Now that’s


79
0:10:23,439 --> 0:10:30,749
alls that it means. Now if a person comes
over and says “I broke a leg” say “call


80
0:10:30,749 --> 0:10:36,769
911, go to the nearest hospital, I can’t
deal with that” that would be saner, than


81
0:10:36,769 --> 0:10:42,35
saying “oh my god, how did that happen?”-
“I fell off a 20 foot ladder” you still


82
0:10:42,35 --> 0:10:49,939
have to call 911 cause you can’t deal with
it. Well the person says “don’t you have


83
0:10:49,939 --> 0:10:54,129
any sympathy? What do you mean call 911?”
 - “yeah, I’m sorry you broke your leg”


84
0:10:54,129 --> 0:11:3,589
they’d feel better with that, but sane means,
to do what you can to help them out of that


85
0:11:3,589 --> 0:11:11,709
situation. Saner, never sane. Wiser, never
wise. Smarter, never smart. You know what


86
0:11:11,709 --> 0:11:18,699
that means? So, when a person says “well
what’s the answer to all these problems?”


87
0:11:18,699 --> 0:11:29,889
that’s a stupid question, there’s no answer,
there are answers as you go along. “I wonder


88
0:11:29,889 --> 0:11:36,55
what Fresco meant by a sane society?” well,
nobody ever asked me, but that would be a


89
0:11:36,55 --> 0:11:45,8
lecture in itself. “What’s a sane society?”
That society is saner, do you understand what


90
0:11:45,8 --> 0:11:54,19
I’m saying? Now those are the tools I wanted
you to know about, to make sure, so when you’re


91
0:11:54,19 --> 0:11:57,91
look at a neurologist, he’s just measuring
the reaction the brain has when you stick


92
0:11:57,91 --> 0:12:5,959
a needle here, there, he knows what zone of
the brain, he can draw a map of feelings,


93
0:12:5,959 --> 0:12:12,629
depression, he can map out the brain. Then
he can look for toxins in the brain, but he


94
0:12:12,629 --> 0:12:15,91
can’t understand the mind, he can’t understand
that it’s responding organism. When you


95
0:12:15,91 --> 0:12:25,149
use ‘mind’ you think like the associative
system? - Yes, that’s alls you have is the


96
0:12:25,149 --> 0:12:33,5
associative system, you never become sane,
can you understand that? If there’s a society


97
0:12:33,5 --> 0:12:35,449
out there that says “boy they’ve attained
the ultimate” there could be no such thing.


98
0:12:35,449 --> 0:12:47,67
Ultimate means they’re all [UNKNOWN] when
you die it’s ultimate. But we all adjust


99
0:12:47,67 --> 0:12:55,139
constantly? We don’t adjust, we are made
that way by circumstances. We either do or


100
0:12:55,139 --> 0:13:1,92
we blow our top. There are people that insist
that the world that they have in their head


101
0:13:1,92 --> 0:13:10,42
is the real world, they wind up in institutions.
What’s what they have in their head is only


102
0:13:10,42 --> 0:13:20,139
their own little unique differences. So, if
you ask a person, they say “I’m not well


103
0:13:20,139 --> 0:13:25,279
mentally” say “what is it that you want?”
 - “well I want a fair relationship with


104
0:13:25,279 --> 0:13:31,92
people” or if you went to live in a seminal
Indian village, if you don’t talk their


105
0:13:31,92 --> 0:13:37,68
language you’ll never get along with them.
So do you wanna become a seminal Indian? Or


106
0:13:37,68 --> 0:13:42,939
do you wanna be you in a seminal village?
You can’t be you in a seminal village, you


107
0:13:42,939 --> 0:13:49,16
have to change the village. You have to go
into the village and say “everything you


108
0:13:49,16 --> 0:13:52,959
guys do are wrong” and show them a new way,
that’s almost impossible, so it’s easier


109
0:13:52,959 --> 0:14:1,8
to kill you, that’s what the Arab Israeli
thing is, it can go no where, it’ll never


110
0:14:1,8 --> 0:14:7,389
workout cause they don’t even know what
the problem is. The problem is everybody wants


111
0:14:7,389 --> 0:14:14,16
a piece of the pie. Now what does that mean?
They want same opportunities other people


112
0:14:14,16 --> 0:14:22,329
have, without discrimination, can’t have
that, cause there are people already in power,


113
0:14:22,329 --> 0:14:30,139
only if they lose that power. As I understand
it, things were so bad in Russia that the


114
0:14:30,139 --> 0:14:39,839
people revolted, and they shot the royal family,
kids an’ all, they didn’t want any carryovers.


115
0:14:39,839 --> 0:14:48,47
So, when Joe Stalin sent people to Siberia
to work, they were disruptive to his culture,


116
0:14:48,47 --> 0:14:56,449
or his concept of culture. Now Joe Stalin
never said “what kind of concepts should


117
0:14:56,449 --> 0:15:1,6
I have had?” he would never talk that way,
he wouldn’t be Joe Stalin if he did. If


118
0:15:1,6 --> 0:15:6,279
you walked over to Hitler and said “suppose
you killed all the Jews, then what?” he


119
0:15:6,279 --> 0:15:15,5
doesn’t think about those things, you know
what I mean? It isn’t the Jews, it’s the


120
0:15:15,5 --> 0:15:22,439
business world that he doesn’t like. I don’t
like Jewish conditioning, but I don’t like


121
0:15:22,439 --> 0:15:29,149
Catholic conditioning, I don’t like Presbyterian
conditioning, I don’t like American conditioning,


122
0:15:29,149 --> 0:17:29,149
so it’s the conditioning that’s a problem.
But you only do what you can do.
