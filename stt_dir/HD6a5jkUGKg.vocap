###13 MATT FARAH: You know, people talk about the golden age of
###15 muscle cars like it was 50 years ago, like the last good
###19 muscle car Americans came out with was in 1969 or '70.
###23 But I disagree.
###24 I think the golden age of muscle cars is right now.
###27 The new Shelby GT 500 has 660 horsepower.
###31 The Camaro ZL1 has 580 horsepower.
###35 And even this CTS-V wagon has 556 horsepower.
###40 Now, these two cars behind me are pretty special.
###43 I mean, underneath, you have very similar drivetrains.
###46 And it's a testament to General Motors that they are
###48 willing to make this drivetrain with either a
###51 Camaro body on it, or a station wagon body on it,
###53 depending on what you want.
###56 We've come to Texas, and as we know, everything
###59 is bigger in Texas.
###60 The portions of barbecue are massive.
###63 The boobies are gigantic.
###65 And a man named John has a small shop here, and he likes
###69 to build things that go obscenely fast.
###71 [ROCK MUSIC]
###89 JOHN HENNESSEY: You know, this whole thing probably started
###91 as a kid, where my dad exposed me to cars, and if a fast car
###95 was cool, a faster car was better.
###97 And as I grew up and had my own car, I bought a 442 Olds
###102 when I was 16.
###103 I bought it with my own money, and it wasn't a day before I
###106 had the air lid flipped upside down on the Quadro Dog
###110 carburetor trying to get more power out of it.
###112 So I've been doing it for a little over 20 years, started
###114 in 1991 as a hobby.
###116 Hobby got out of control, and here we are, building probably
###119 300 to 350 cars a year for clients all around the world.
###124 MATT FARAH: Now, this is the HPE700 package.
###126 And what you get for that is 707 horsepower and 717
###132 pound-feet of torque.
###134 Now, you probably imagine that feels great to drive.
###138 But wait till you hear how it sounds.
###140 
###144 Shall we?
###146 
###150 The Camaro ZL1 is already a massive
###152 improvement over the SS.
###154 Not only do you get the LSA supercharged engine out of the
###157 CTS-V, you also get the magnetic ride control
###161 suspension, which is just about the best piece of
###164 hardware General Motors makes.
###166 So good that it's actually not even really worth improving
###169 for a street car.
###171 If you wanted faster lap times, maybe.
###173 But the ride is really good, actually.
###178 I like how Hennessey makes the power, too.
###181 It's not just crank up the boost.
###184 Because that--
###185 yeah, you might get one or two good passes, but once it gets
###188 heat soaked, your car starts to slip.
###191 It's not cool.
###192 This--
###193 different heads, different cam, headers, exhaust,
###197 old-school muscle car stuff.
###199 It's not even running that much extra boost.
###202 All the stuff is made old-school horsepower way.
###206 [LAUGHING]
###211 Wow!
###212 Lot of blower whine up front, tons of
###215 exhaust noise out back.
###217 I'm scaring cattle right now.
###219 They don't want no part of me on the side of the road.
###221 
###225 JOHN HENNESSEY: GMLS-based motors are a
###227 great platform to modify.
###229 So new Corvette, Camaro, SL1, Cadillac CTS-Vs. I'd say right
###235 now in the last 24 months, more than 50% of our business
###239 is GM LS small-block Chevy-based V8s.
###244 They're very easy to modify.
###246 They're very reliable when they're modified.
###249 We've got the ability to do the calibration, so they get
###252 great fuel economy.
###253 They drive like stock.
###254 And most of our packages up to 700 horsepower will offer a
###257 three-year, 36,000-mile warranty.
###259 And I can only do that because I've got the confidence that
###261 it's going to be reliable and live.
###262 And the customer's going to be able to drive it like they
###264 would drive an everyday stock car.
###266 
###272 I can drive around like this all I want.
###275 And the car's going to hold up.
###276 It's going to start when I need it to start.
###278 And if I'm going to buy a $55,000 SL1 Camaro, put
###283 another $20,00 into it with Hennessey for all the
###286 upgrades, I'm $75,000 into a car.
###289 That car had better start when I want it to start.
###292 
###299 That was only 4,000 rpm, by the way.
###303 I need it to be reliable.
###304 I need it to get me where I want to go.
###306 And the good news is, this package comes with a
###308 three-year, 36,000-mile warranty.
###312 So when it breaks, it's on him, not you.
###314 
###317 If you've got the money, and you want to be eating ZR1s,
###322 this basically turns a Camaro into a ZR1.
###325 
###334 JOHN HENNESSEY: Every car is different.
###335 I look at every car as almost like a
###336 stock in a stock market.
###338 What potential does it have?
###341 If a new BMW M3 comes out, and it's 414 horsepower,
###345 whatever's from the factory BMW, I know, they take their
###349 cars, and they don't leave a whole lot of meat on the bone.
###350 They tune their cars to where, when you get it from the
###353 dealer, there's not a whole lot of upside left.
###355 Whereas a lot of the Ford stuff, GM stuff, a lot of
###358 American muscle car and sports cars, typically there's a lot
###361 more room to add more power.
###363 And so, you look at the LS-based motors.
###367 A Cadillac CTS-V, for instance, comes in with 556
###370 horsepower.
###371 That platform goes up to 700, 750 horsepower super reliably.
###375 Now, you want to go beyond 700 or 750, then you need to look
###378 at pistons and rods and doing additional upgrades that are a
###381 lot more expensive.
###381 You can do 1,000 horsepower, and we'll offer warranty with
###384 that package.
###385 But every package is different.
###387 It's our job to figure out, how far can we go that we're
###390 not pushing over the edge of reliability?
###395 MATT FARAH: John will tell you that there are no downsides
###397 whatsoever to this package.
###399 And I agree with him, mostly.
###401 You see the exhaust?
###403 It's really loud.
###404 And that's coming from me.
###405 It's really, ridiculously, ludicrously loud.
###408 It is so loud that I actually felt bad about driving past
###413 people's houses while road testing it.
###415 It's that loud.
###416 And then there's a cam.
###417 Now, a cam really wakes up an LS engine.
###420 You get a lot more power out of it.
###421 So I understand why you'd want one.
###423 But you get the uneven, lumpy idle.
###425 Now, some people love that.
###427 Other people think that in between gears and while going
###429 between reverse and park and drive or at a red light, it
###433 makes the car feel rough and uncivilized.
###435 Now here, it's up to you to make the choice if that's what
###438 you want from your car.
###439 
###446 This car will go 185 miles an hour in the standing mile,
###450 which, if you recall, is about 10 miles an hour faster than I
###455 went in a bone stock ZR1.
###458 So you know that even if you can't do it right off the
###461 line, sooner or later that power will
###463 make it to the ground.
###465 I would advise a set of sticky tires for this car, though.
###469 Because 707 horsepower and 717 pounds of torque, I'll just
###476 blow them right off.
###477 
###482 Now, the bad news for someone like me is that, this car,
###486 it's hard to see out of.
###487 You can't wear a helmet in it.
###490 It looks cool.
###490 It does.
###491 I'll give them that.
###492 But for me, not so practical.
###495 Fortunately, back there, we have the model of
###498 practicality.
###499 CTS-V wagon--
###500 seats five, same LSA engine, same HPE700 package.
###506 You can get it for both cars.
###508 And that means same deal.
###510 707 horsepower, 717 pound-feet of torque.
###514 And while pretty much everyone that I know, anyway, would say
###519 that a 700-horsepower station wagon is extremely cool, I
###525 think we should find out which one is faster in a drag race.
###529 
###542 All right, my favorite time of day--
###544 drag racing time.
###545 We're done with the road.
###546 So HPE700 Camaro versus your daily driver.
###551 JOHN HENNESSEY: They both make similar power.
###552 The wagon actually probably makes a tiny bit more power
###554 than the ZL1.
###554 The ZL1's a little bit lighter.
###556 So it's going to be a close race.
###557 MATT FARAH: And you drive at your track all the time, and
###559 I've never driven here.
###560 JOHN HENNESSEY: I've got a little bit of
###560 a home field advantage.
###561 MATT FARAH: Home field advantage counts.
###563 But who cares, right?
###564 They're both fast.
###565 Let's go race.
###566 
###650 MALE SPEAKER: This is John, me, Thad,
###651 and Tom against Matt.
###652 MALE SPEAKER: Should we stick our arms out the window?
###654 JOHN HENNESSEY: Yeah, exactly.
###655 
###670 JOHN HENNESSEY: Master control!
###671 
###676 MALE SPEAKER: I'm quite comfortable, how are you?
###678 MALE SPEAKER: I'm great.
###678 MALE SPEAKER: Wow, that's awesome.
###680 
###688 MALE SPEAKER: We just have to go to the other county.
###690 MATT FARAH: Oh.
###691 OK.
###692 POLICE OFFICER: Go back where you was.
###693 MATT FARAH: Which county?
###693 MALE SPEAKER: Like 500 feet that way.
###694 POLICE OFFICER: That's Colorado County, on the other
###695 side of the creek.
###696 MATT FARAH: Really?
###697 POLICE OFFICER: Just go over there.
###698 That way everybody will stop calling in.
###701 MATT FARAH: Are people calling in?
###701 These things are so damn loud.
###703 MALE SPEAKER: No, they thought we were stealing stuff.
###704 POLICE OFFICER: No, it's the three cars.
###705 It wasn't noise.
###706 MATT FARAH: Oh, OK.
###707 POLICE OFFICER: It was the three cars.
###707 MATT FARAH: Oh.
###708 All right.
###709 All right, back across the creek.
###710 Sure.
###711 No problem.
###711 POLICE OFFICER: You go across the creek, you'll be fine.
###712 MATT FARAH: OK.
###712 POLICE OFFICER: You won't hear from us.
###713 MATT FARAH: Then they'll call someone else, right?
###715 POLICE OFFICER: Probably.
###715 MATT FARAH: OK.
###716
