1
0:0:24,0 --> 0:0:29,133
George Parr, you are an investment banker. I am, yeah


2
0:0:29,133 --> 0:0:32,1
As such you have your fingers right


3
0:0:32,1 --> 0:0:35,0
on the pulse of the financial market


4
0:0:35,0 --> 0:0:36,233
yes, very much so, yes


5
0:0:36,233 --> 0:0:42,8
 and during this summer there has been a great deal of turbulence


6
0:0:42,8 --> 0:0:44,0
 and volatility


7
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:48,5
yes, volatility, volatility, tremendous, tremendous


8
0:0:48,5 --> 0:0:50,2
what's caused that?


9
0:0:50,2 --> 0:0:52,8
well, you have to remember two things about the market


10
0:0:52,8 --> 0:0:56,6
one  is that they are made of very sharp and sophisticated people


11
0:0:56,6 --> 0:0:59,167
These are the greatest brains


12
0:0:59,167 --> 0:1:1,633
and the second thing you have to remember is that the financial markets


13
0:1:1,633 --> 0:1:2,7
to use the common phrase


14
0:1:2,7 --> 0:1:4,3
are driven by sentiment


15
0:1:4,3 --> 0:1:5,9
What does that mean?


16
0:1:5,9 --> 0:1:11,0
What does that mean?, well, things, let's say are just going along as normally in the market


17
0:1:11,0 --> 0:1:13,1
and then, suddenly, out of the blue,


18
0:1:13,1 --> 0:1:15,5
one of these very sharp and sophisticated people


19
0:1:15,5 --> 0:1:18,0
my God, something awful is going to happen


20
0:1:18,0 --> 0:1:19,9
we have lost everything


21
0:1:19,9 --> 0:1:23,5
oh, my god, what are we going to do? what are we going to do?


22
0:1:23,5 --> 0:1:25,33
shall I jump out of the window?


23
0:1:25,33 --> 0:1:26,33
shall I jump out of the window?


24
0:1:26,33 --> 0:1:29,0
we've got to jump out of the window


25
0:1:29,0 --> 0:1:31,3
oh, sell, sell, sell, sell


26
0:1:31,3 --> 0:1:35,7
precisely


27
0:1:35,7 --> 0:1:39,1
and then, a few days later, the same sophisticated person says:


28
0:1:39,1 --> 0:1:42,8
you know, I feel things are going rather well


29
0:1:42,8 --> 0:1:43,8
I agree with you


30
0:1:43,8 --> 0:1:45,9
we are rich, we are rich, buy, buy, buy


31
0:1:45,9 --> 0:1:48,5
buy, buy, buy


32
0:1:48,5 --> 0:1:53,3
and that's what we call market of sentiment


33
0:1:53,3 --> 0:1:55,8
surely we are exaggerating just a bit


34
0:1:55,8 --> 0:1:57,9
well, I don't know


35
0:1:57,9 --> 0:2:1,261
In August, middle August this year, when the market actually plunged in London


36
0:2:1,261 --> 0:2:4,524
a well known city firm, State global market, issued an statement


37
0:2:4,524 --> 0:2:13,167
in which, I quote, "the market participants don't know wether to buy on the rumour and sell on the news


38
0:2:13,167 --> 0:2:15,914
do the opposite, do both


39
0:2:15,914 --> 0:2:22,382
or do neither depending on which way the wind is blowing" unquote


40
0:2:22,382 --> 0:2:27,433
yes, and this is the kind of rigourous analysis


41
0:2:27,433 --> 0:2:28,949
we'll pay huge salaries for


42
0:2:28,949 --> 0:2:30,2
yes, exactly


43
0:2:30,2 --> 0:2:33,7
a few days later, when the market had gone up a little bit


44
0:2:33,7 --> 0:2:37,8
the Senior Equity Adviser in MBA Amron Morgan said, and I quote,


45
0:2:37,8 --> 0:2:42,667
We are back to happy days, again


46
0:2:42,667 --> 0:2:47,0
well, no price is too high for that kind of mature wisdom


47
0:2:47,0 --> 0:2:49,833
certainly


48
0:2:49,833 --> 0:2:50,9
This sort of people are paid  millions of pounds in bonus


49
0:2:50,9 --> 0:2:53,167
yes, of course


50
0:2:53,167 --> 0:2:58,8
During this summer there had been actual causes behind the volatility of the markets


51
0:2:58,8 --> 0:3:0,4
yeah


52
0:3:0,4 --> 0:3:2,2
Specifically,and specially in America


53
0:3:2,2 --> 0:3:5,4
granting vast numbers of mortgages


54
0:3:5,4 --> 0:3:7,4
to people who can't afford them


55
0:3:7,4 --> 0:3:10,9
in properties which are diminishing in value


56
0:3:10,9 --> 0:3:14,3
it's the so called subprime situation,


57
0:3:14,3 --> 0:3:16,5
the subprime market, yes


58
0:3:16,5 --> 0:3:17,8
How did that work?


59
0:3:17,8 --> 0:3:21,1
Imagine, if you can, let's say


60
0:3:21,1 --> 0:3:23,5
an unemployed black man sitting on the crumbling porch


61
0:3:23,5 --> 0:3:27,5
somewhere in Alabama, in his string-vest


62
0:3:27,5 --> 0:3:29,3
and a chap comes along and he says:


63
0:3:29,3 --> 0:3:31,6
would you like to buy this house before it falls down


64
0:3:31,6 --> 0:3:36,7
and why don't you let me lend you the money?


65
0:3:36,7 --> 0:3:39,0
and is this chap, who says this, is he a banker?


66
0:3:39,0 --> 0:3:41,0
oh no, no, no. he is a mortgage salesman


67
0:3:41,0 --> 0:3:42,3
his entire income depends entirely on


68
0:3:42,3 --> 0:3:46,0
the number of mortgages that he can arrange


69
0:3:46,0 --> 0:3:51,0
so, his judgement to arrange mortgages is completely objective


70
0:3:51,0 --> 0:3:53,533
completely objective, yes


71
0:3:53,533 --> 0:3:55,9
and what happens next?


72
0:3:55,9 --> 0:4:1,33
well, then this debt, this mortgage, is taken, bought by a bank,


73
0:4:1,33 --> 0:4:2,1
and packaged together, almost fit


74
0:4:2,1 --> 0:4:5,5
with a lot of other similar debts


75
0:4:5,5 --> 0:4:9,0
without going into much details about what is actually...?


76
0:4:9,0 --> 0:4:10,6
without going into any details


77
0:4:10,6 --> 0:4:14,0
that's not rewarding


78
0:4:14,0 --> 0:4:16,1
so this is put into a package of debts


79
0:4:16,1 --> 0:4:19,367
and then it is moved into Wall street and,  this, this, this's extrordinary what happens


80
0:4:19,367 --> 0:4:23,5
somehow, this package of dodgy debts


81
0:4:23,5 --> 0:4:25,9
stops being a package of dodgy debts


82
0:4:25,9 --> 0:4:29,8
and starts being what we call an Structured Investment Vehicle


83
0:4:29,8 --> 0:4:32,733
an SIV?


84
0:4:32,733 --> 0:4:35,0
an SIV, exactly, yeah


85
0:4:35,0 --> 0:4:37,1
I see, and then someone like you comes along and


86
0:4:37,1 --> 0:4:40,67
and buys it


87
0:4:40,67 --> 0:4:43,6
yes, I would ring up someone in Tokyo and would say


88
0:4:43,6 --> 0:4:45,8
look I've got this package, do you want to buy it?


89
0:4:45,8 --> 0:4:47,0
and they say, what is in it?


90
0:4:47,0 --> 0:4:49,2
and I say, I haven't got the faintest idea


91
0:4:49,2 --> 0:4:50,8
and they say, how much do you want for it?


92
0:4:50,8 --> 0:4:52,4
I say 100 million dollars


93
0:4:52,4 --> 0:4:53,9
and they say, fine, and that's it


94
0:4:53,9 --> 0:4:55,9
and that's the market


95
0:4:55,9 --> 0:5:3,4
and presumably this package, that kind of thing can happen several times


96
0:5:3,4 --> 0:5:5,0
it could, possibly, yes


97
0:5:5,0 --> 0:5:7,889
and every time it does, of course,


98
0:5:7,889 --> 0:5:11,344
you, or someone like you, would get a fee and a marker


99
0:5:11,344 --> 0:5:15,315
and a profit, yes, you wouldn't expect us to do this for nothing


100
0:5:15,315 --> 0:5:23,45
in view of the fact that in these packages there is a lot of dodgy debts


101
0:5:23,45 --> 0:5:30,243
what is it about them that attracts the, you know, financial risk-takers?


102
0:5:30,243 --> 0:5:35,598
yes, because, these hedge-funds, as they are called, which specialise in these debts


103
0:5:35,598 --> 0:5:37,572
they all have got very good names


104
0:5:37,572 --> 0:5:40,484
you mean they are responsible companies?


105
0:5:40,484 --> 0:5:42,738
no, no,  it has nothing to do with the reputation


106
0:5:42,738 --> 0:5:46,6
they all have got very good names, the names they think up are very good


107
0:5:46,6 --> 0:5:52,414
I'll give you an example, there is a very well-known American Wall street firm, called Bearn Stearns


108
0:5:52,414 --> 0:5:57,332
who had two of these hedge-funds,which specialise in these mortgage debts


109
0:5:57,332 --> 0:6:2,237
and they lost so much money, they lost so much of their value


110
0:6:2,237 --> 0:6:9,282
That Bearn and Stearn announced that they would have to put in 3.2 billion dollars into one of the funds to try to keep it afloat


111
0:6:9,282 --> 0:6:12,42
3.2 billion dollars. 3.2 billion, yes, yes


112
0:6:12,42 --> 0:6:16,226
the investors couldn't get any money out of it they would let the other fund go


113
0:6:16,226 --> 0:6:22,449
but one of these funds was called "High Grade Structures Credit Strategies"


114
0:6:22,449 --> 0:6:30,7
and the other one was called the "High Grade Structured Credit Enhaced Leveraged Fund


115
0:6:30,7 --> 0:6:34,652
well, that sounds very good, that's good, very trustworthy


116
0:6:34,652 --> 0:6:36,745
well, this is the magic of the market


117
0:6:36,745 --> 0:6:40,447
what started off as lending of a few thousand dollars to a unemployed blackman in his string-vest


118
0:6:40,447 --> 0:6:44,904
has become a High Grade Structured Credit Enhaced Leveraged Fund


119
0:6:44,904 --> 0:6:47,291
I like the sound of it


120
0:6:47,291 --> 0:6:49,409
It is good, sounds very trustworthy


121
0:6:49,409 --> 0:6:50,127
I mean, it's got good words in it


122
0:6:50,127 --> 0:6:52,314
it's got the word "high"


123
0:6:52,314 --> 0:6:53,212
"high" is good


124
0:6:53,212 --> 0:6:55,606
"high" is good, better than low anyway


125
0:6:55,606 --> 0:6:56,958
yes, yes


126
0:6:56,958 --> 0:6:59,2
and "Structured" is another good word. Very good


127
0:6:59,2 --> 0:7:2,706
"Enhanced". I love "Enhanced". "Enhanced" is very good


128
0:7:2,706 --> 0:7:5,433
I'd buy anything if it said "Enhanced"


129
0:7:5,433 --> 0:7:11,662
It might have been different if it said the "Unemployed Blackman in the String Vest Fund", but, but


130
0:7:11,662 --> 0:7:19,102
yes, then alarm bells might have sound


131
0:7:19,102 --> 0:7:24,139
But despite these very plausible names, surely the reality is


132
0:7:24,139 --> 0:7:30,433
that the people that lend all this money have been incredible stupid


133
0:7:30,433 --> 0:7:34,311
oh no, oh no, the reality is that what was stupid is that at some point


134
0:7:34,311 --> 0:7:38,0
somebody asked "how much money these houses are all actually worth?"


135
0:7:38,0 --> 0:7:42,834
If nobody had actually bothered to ask that question everything would have gone on as perfectly normal


136
0:7:42,834 --> 0:7:44,696
but unfortunately they did


137
0:7:44,696 --> 0:7:50,791
People are saying that the financial crisis is likely to turn into a financial meltdown, I mean


138
0:7:50,791 --> 0:7:52,3
can it be avoided?


139
0:7:52,3 --> 0:7:55,207
It can be avoided provided that Governments and Central Banks


140
0:7:55,207 --> 0:8:5,968
give us, the financial speculators, back the money that we've lost


141
0:8:5,968 --> 0:8:5,267
isn't that rewarding greed and stupidity?


142
0:8:5,267 --> 0:8:14,0
No, no, it's rewarding what Prime Minister Gordon Brown called the "Ingenuity of the Market"


143
0:8:14,0 --> 0:8:16,12
You see, I don't


144
0:8:16,12 --> 0:8:17,632
We don't want this money to spend on ourselves


145
0:8:17,632 --> 0:8:21,843
we want this money to get into the market so that we can carry on borrowing and lending money


146
0:8:21,843 --> 0:8:26,57
as if nothing had happened, without thinking too much about it


147
0:8:26,57 --> 0:8:28,388
yes, but, if the worst came to the worst


148
0:8:28,388 --> 0:8:32,0
and you didn't get this money, what then?


149
0:8:32,0 --> 0:8:34,437
well, then, there would be another market crash


150
0:8:34,437 --> 0:8:36,938
and I would say to you what people like me always say


151
0:8:36,938 --> 0:8:38,948
that is not us that would suffer


152
0:8:38,948 --> 0:8:44,6
it's your pension fund


153
0:8:44,6 --> 0:10:44,6
Thank you very much, George Parr
