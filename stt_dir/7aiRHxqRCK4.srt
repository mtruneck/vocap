1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:6,72



2
0:0:6,72 --> 0:0:8,16
-Big 'ol Hummer.


3
0:0:8,16 --> 0:0:11,4



4
0:0:11,4 --> 0:0:13,216
Oh, there's kids skating
in there.


5
0:0:13,216 --> 0:0:19,8



6
0:0:19,8 --> 0:0:20,58
How you doing?


7
0:0:20,58 --> 0:0:20,92
-Pretty good.


8
0:0:20,92 --> 0:0:21,42
-What's your name?


9
0:0:21,42 --> 0:0:21,92
-Jonathan.


10
0:0:21,92 --> 0:0:22,53
-Pretty cool.


11
0:0:22,53 --> 0:0:24,94
Nice to meet you, Jonathan.


12
0:0:24,94 --> 0:0:26,31
-You were skating fast.


13
0:0:26,31 --> 0:0:27,97
I'm like, oh, shit.


14
0:0:27,97 --> 0:0:28,715
It's Daewon.


15
0:0:28,715 --> 0:0:30,33
I saw your "Decker" video.


16
0:0:30,33 --> 0:0:32,8
-Oh, the old one, yeah.


17
0:0:32,8 --> 0:0:32,99
That was a long time ago.


18
0:0:32,99 --> 0:0:34,81
It's crazy that it's
so long ago.


19
0:0:34,81 --> 0:0:37,95
That was eight, seven
years ago.


20
0:0:37,95 --> 0:0:39,32
Time flies, man.


21
0:0:39,32 --> 0:0:40,88
Take advantage, dude.


22
0:0:40,88 --> 0:0:41,62
-Don't do it.


23
0:0:41,62 --> 0:0:43,32
Don't OK.


24
0:0:43,32 --> 0:0:45,76
-We'll redo the courthouse
thing that--


25
0:0:45,76 --> 0:0:50,28



26
0:0:50,28 --> 0:0:53,62
-People would do lines back
then and then after they


27
0:0:53,62 --> 0:0:54,786
viewed the line, people
would follow him


28
0:0:54,786 --> 0:0:56,75
like yeah, Start cheering.


29
0:0:56,75 --> 0:0:59,66
-The end of the camera's
part you'll see it in


30
0:0:59,66 --> 0:1:1,232
"Goldfish," I think.


31
0:1:1,232 --> 0:1:5,724
Skating has changed in that
way a lot, it seems.


32
0:1:5,724 --> 0:1:8,59
It's got so serious.


33
0:1:8,59 --> 0:1:9,177
Now it's huge.


34
0:1:9,177 --> 0:1:10,608
That's good, man.


35
0:1:10,608 --> 0:1:12,4
Just keep skating.


36
0:1:12,4 --> 0:1:15,36
Didn't even like stuff
that they do, don't


37
0:1:15,36 --> 0:1:15,54
even worry about it.


38
0:1:15,54 --> 0:1:18,375
Don't ever sweat like, hey, is
this good enough or is that


39
0:1:18,375 --> 0:1:19,25
good enough.


40
0:1:19,25 --> 0:1:21,7
As long as you're happy
with it, it's fine.


41
0:1:21,7 --> 0:1:22,364
-Yeah, he's not intimidating
to be around.


42
0:1:22,364 --> 0:1:23,0
He's cool.


43
0:1:23,0 --> 0:1:26,5
He make you feel like
you're hanging out.


44
0:1:26,5 --> 0:1:26,64
-All right.


45
0:1:26,64 --> 0:1:28,16
Welcome back to the show.


46
0:1:28,16 --> 0:1:30,29
This week, I went out
to Los Angeles, met


47
0:1:30,29 --> 0:1:32,2
up with Daewon Song.


48
0:1:32,2 --> 0:1:35,136
Daewon brought along Daniel
Castillo, and we went to some


49
0:1:35,136 --> 0:1:38,13
of the spots that those guys
filmed for the video "Love


50
0:1:38,13 --> 0:1:41,51
Child," which is really kind of
trip for me because, I felt


51
0:1:41,51 --> 0:1:43,94
like I went in some time machine
and went into this


52
0:1:43,94 --> 0:1:46,52
video that was really important
to me as a skater in


53
0:1:46,52 --> 0:1:47,91
the early '90s.


54
0:1:47,91 --> 0:1:50,53
I think "Love Child" marked a
change for World Industries


55
0:1:50,53 --> 0:1:52,47
and a change for skateboarding
in general.


56
0:1:52,47 --> 0:1:54,44
It was just really different.


57
0:1:54,44 --> 0:1:58,435
It was like these city kids
all skating these street


58
0:1:58,435 --> 0:2:2,65
spots, the schoolyards Then
like '80s like Santa Cruz


59
0:2:2,65 --> 0:2:4,64
speed wheels kind of
skating or like


60
0:2:4,64 --> 0:2:5,85
white kids before they--


61
0:2:5,85 --> 0:2:6,505
I don't know.


62
0:2:6,505 --> 0:2:8,5
We just looked at some spots
those guys skated.


63
0:2:8,5 --> 0:2:9,38
And that's all.


64
0:2:9,38 --> 0:2:10,43
This is the Daewon
Song episode.


65
0:2:10,43 --> 0:2:12,17
I hope you enjoy it.


66
0:2:12,17 --> 0:2:12,76
-All right.


67
0:2:12,76 --> 0:2:14,88
So I'm trying to think where
we should go first.


68
0:2:14,88 --> 0:2:17,49
Seventh Street is an old classic
spot, but I think


69
0:2:17,49 --> 0:2:18,89
people have seen enough
of that place.


70
0:2:18,89 --> 0:2:20,79
You know what I mean?


71
0:2:20,79 --> 0:2:23,39
The best spots are the ones
that just you can't even


72
0:2:23,39 --> 0:2:25,9
believe it, hours and hours
of skating went on.


73
0:2:25,9 --> 0:2:26,69
-Could you describe it?


74
0:2:26,69 --> 0:2:30,14
-This is the school like at the
end of "Rubbish Heap" when


75
0:2:30,14 --> 0:2:34,82
Rodney's part ends, Jeremy
Klein runs and folks just


76
0:2:34,82 --> 0:2:35,96
gives him a street board
when he comes out


77
0:2:35,96 --> 0:2:38,34
here and ollies that.


78
0:2:38,34 --> 0:2:41,12
[INAUDIBLE] insane, like pretty
crazy to think about,


79
0:2:41,12 --> 0:2:43,178
and he does a couple of other
things on the street board.


80
0:2:43,178 --> 0:2:48,66



81
0:2:48,66 --> 0:2:49,263
-It seem so weird.


82
0:2:49,263 --> 0:2:50,92
It's so big.


83
0:2:50,92 --> 0:2:54,38
Like I watch "Rubbish Heap"
and I was like, man.


84
0:2:54,38 --> 0:2:56,59
The World never even interested
me whatsoever.


85
0:2:56,59 --> 0:2:59,65
I was more like a Z-boy, Dogtown
kind of guy and from


86
0:2:59,65 --> 0:3:0,78
where I grew up.


87
0:3:0,78 --> 0:3:3,447
-Around our neighborhoods,
Daniel grew up in a fucked up


88
0:3:3,447 --> 0:3:4,685
part of Culver City, man.


89
0:3:4,685 --> 0:3:6,65
Up at Stoner Boulevard
near the projects.


90
0:3:6,65 --> 0:3:8,19
Whew!


91
0:3:8,19 --> 0:3:8,45
-Yeah.


92
0:3:8,45 --> 0:3:11,62
I think definitely if I didn't
skate, there would've been a


93
0:3:11,62 --> 0:3:15,79
chance I probably would
have done drive-bys.


94
0:3:15,79 --> 0:3:17,52
Oh yeah, I got shot, man.


95
0:3:17,52 --> 0:3:20,75
I was just at a party and wrong
place at the wrong time


96
0:3:20,75 --> 0:3:21,98
pretty much.


97
0:3:21,98 --> 0:3:23,59
They thought me and my
friends were a bunch


98
0:3:23,59 --> 0:3:25,265
of gangsters, probably.


99
0:3:25,265 --> 0:3:30,26
And they just unloaded
on us, like two cars.


100
0:3:30,26 --> 0:3:32,68
But now, I always stay
far from that.


101
0:3:32,68 --> 0:3:37,21
And skating is so good for
kids that grew up in bad


102
0:3:37,21 --> 0:3:37,475
neighborhoods.


103
0:3:37,475 --> 0:3:38,71
Do you know what I mean?


104
0:3:38,71 --> 0:3:41,57
Because it gets them like
psyched on something else


105
0:3:41,57 --> 0:3:43,284
rather than what's going
on around them.


106
0:3:43,284 --> 0:3:45,95



107
0:3:45,95 --> 0:3:48,8
Frescas was my World
Industries.


108
0:3:48,8 --> 0:3:52,0
I'm still under the
same distribution.


109
0:3:52,0 --> 0:3:54,23
Like where World started
is where I'm still at.


110
0:3:54,23 --> 0:3:57,5
It wasn't the first place I've
ever gotten where I first got


111
0:3:57,5 --> 0:4:0,82
sponsored and I'm still
at the same company.


112
0:4:0,82 --> 0:4:2,58
It's pretty crazy
to think about.


113
0:4:2,58 --> 0:4:4,71
Daniel, how old were you?


114
0:4:4,71 --> 0:4:5,8
14?


115
0:4:5,8 --> 0:4:5,82
13?


116
0:4:5,82 --> 0:4:6,105
Yeah.


117
0:4:6,105 --> 0:4:11,255
So I was like 15 or 16.


118
0:4:11,255 --> 0:4:12,505
And I miss those days.


119
0:4:12,505 --> 0:4:19,54



120
0:4:19,54 --> 0:4:22,79
Like in 92, when they had
revamped the whole team like


121
0:4:22,79 --> 0:4:26,18
and like a lot of the guys
have been on it took off.


122
0:4:26,18 --> 0:4:30,19
It was like me, Kareem, Shiloh,


123
0:4:30,19 --> 0:4:33,47
Chico, Spencer, Daniel.


124
0:4:33,47 --> 0:4:34,85
That's pretty insane.


125
0:4:34,85 --> 0:4:37,99
-Yeah, like all of the people
that were in "Love Child" were


126
0:4:37,99 --> 0:4:40,31
totally city kids.


127
0:4:40,31 --> 0:4:42,2
Me and Kareem used to
skate a lot together


128
0:4:42,2 --> 0:4:43,15
when we were younger.


129
0:4:43,15 --> 0:4:46,26
And he was like, yeah, there's
some new guy in World


130
0:4:46,26 --> 0:4:48,45
Industries and I was like who?


131
0:4:48,45 --> 0:4:51,41
He was like some dude
named Daewon.


132
0:4:51,41 --> 0:4:53,34
And I was like, Daewon?


133
0:4:53,34 --> 0:4:55,12
I was like what nationality
is he?


134
0:4:55,12 --> 0:4:56,49
And this is what Kareem said.


135
0:4:56,49 --> 0:4:57,87
Kareem said oh, he's
some nigger.


136
0:4:57,87 --> 0:4:59,75
I don't know.


137
0:4:59,75 --> 0:5:0,21
-OK.


138
0:5:0,21 --> 0:5:2,44
You're gonna trip out on this.


139
0:5:2,44 --> 0:5:4,3
First World ad ever.


140
0:5:4,3 --> 0:5:5,825
This is the tail grab
one foot, that


141
0:5:5,825 --> 0:5:7,67
first White Power ad.


142
0:5:7,67 --> 0:5:8,3
-Yeah.


143
0:5:8,3 --> 0:5:11,21
We had that first ad together,
me, him and Kareem.


144
0:5:11,21 --> 0:5:12,56
It was pretty funny.


145
0:5:12,56 --> 0:5:14,54
Spike Jones actually
shot the photos.


146
0:5:14,54 --> 0:5:16,22
It was pretty crazy.


147
0:5:16,22 --> 0:5:20,45
And it probably took
like an hour.


148
0:5:20,45 --> 0:5:22,67
It was pretty awesome
back then.


149
0:5:22,67 --> 0:5:25,18
-When we got on, Spike was
pretty much in charge.


150
0:5:25,18 --> 0:5:27,55
He was the one doing the ads and
shooting so, we went over


151
0:5:27,55 --> 0:5:28,55
to Tower Tide.


152
0:5:28,55 --> 0:5:33,42
Daniel did a tail grab one foot
Kareem did like a 540 and


153
0:5:33,42 --> 0:5:34,7
what did he do, Daniel?


154
0:5:34,7 --> 0:5:35,35
-A 540 [INAUDIBLE].


155
0:5:35,35 --> 0:5:36,29
-On the same bank?


156
0:5:36,29 --> 0:5:37,37
-Yeah.


157
0:5:37,37 --> 0:5:38,91
-And I had a tail
grab shove it.


158
0:5:38,91 --> 0:5:42,4



159
0:5:42,4 --> 0:5:45,2
No wonder I couldn't pick
up any other sponsors.


160
0:5:45,2 --> 0:5:47,336
So it started right here.


161
0:5:47,336 --> 0:5:48,62
-Recreate it exactly.


162
0:5:48,62 --> 0:5:51,87
-Dude, I don't think I
could do it again.


163
0:5:51,87 --> 0:5:53,81
-Did you go down the
slide in it?


164
0:5:53,81 --> 0:5:54,54
-No.


165
0:5:54,54 --> 0:5:56,45
That was the beginning of the
part where I go down the


166
0:5:56,45 --> 0:5:59,64
slide, and then it's like
the line after that.


167
0:5:59,64 --> 0:6:1,65
It's right after that.


168
0:6:1,65 --> 0:6:4,39
It's the slide and then right
after that is this line where


169
0:6:4,39 --> 0:6:5,64
I do a front pop.


170
0:6:5,64 --> 0:6:7,26
We got to skate through.


171
0:6:7,26 --> 0:6:8,85
So I just see it through.


172
0:6:8,85 --> 0:6:9,88
I'll just tell you what I did.


173
0:6:9,88 --> 0:6:11,13
Is that cool?


174
0:6:11,13 --> 0:6:18,1



175
0:6:18,1 --> 0:6:21,99
Front paw, a point down
there, huge one.


176
0:6:21,99 --> 0:6:24,6
And then my board I did
an ollie tre flip.


177
0:6:24,6 --> 0:6:26,3
Back then I didn't know it
was an ollie tre flip.


178
0:6:26,3 --> 0:6:28,59
I just thought it was some
sort of nollie and then


179
0:6:28,59 --> 0:6:29,63
flinged around.


180
0:6:29,63 --> 0:6:32,36
And then I did the old faithful
like back 180 and


181
0:6:32,36 --> 0:6:33,89
then switch 180.


182
0:6:33,89 --> 0:6:38,7
360 ollie over this.


183
0:6:38,7 --> 0:6:40,44
But I landed it.


184
0:6:40,44 --> 0:6:43,62
I did the worst kick flip
ever right here.


185
0:6:43,62 --> 0:6:47,13
360 flip right there.


186
0:6:47,13 --> 0:6:48,51
And I went off this bump.


187
0:6:48,51 --> 0:6:50,22
Bump with the manhole
was a double flip.


188
0:6:50,22 --> 0:6:52,95



189
0:6:52,95 --> 0:6:57,64
Then I did a poor excuse for
a pop shove it right here.


190
0:6:57,64 --> 0:6:59,22
You can watch it back
and go, wow.


191
0:6:59,22 --> 0:7:0,592
That's lame.


192
0:7:0,592 --> 0:7:2,66
Then I was like, oh, it's
really coming now.


193
0:7:2,66 --> 0:7:3,91
I'm going to prep up for this.


194
0:7:3,91 --> 0:7:8,22



195
0:7:8,22 --> 0:7:11,57
And I'll leap up these and just
went huge with a switch


196
0:7:11,57 --> 0:7:12,76
540 big flip.


197
0:7:12,76 --> 0:7:14,855
But they didn't get that one,
so I just ended up doing a


198
0:7:14,855 --> 0:7:16,65
hill flip shove it.


199
0:7:16,65 --> 0:7:19,72
When I did that line, were
there a lot of lines?


200
0:7:19,72 --> 0:7:21,5
I think it would trip people
up, because they were like,


201
0:7:21,5 --> 0:7:24,71
are you allowed to do lines
long like that?


202
0:7:24,71 --> 0:7:25,39
You know what I mean?


203
0:7:25,39 --> 0:7:28,63
It kind of took a minute to get
down to the grand finale.


204
0:7:28,63 --> 0:7:29,88
The heel flip shove it
looked terrible.


205
0:7:29,88 --> 0:7:35,1



206
0:7:35,1 --> 0:7:37,34
"Love Child" was random.


207
0:7:37,34 --> 0:7:41,39
Three tours plus maybe filming
for like a month


208
0:7:41,39 --> 0:7:42,81
straight and that's it.


209
0:7:42,81 --> 0:7:44,35
Where now, it's like, oh God.


210
0:7:44,35 --> 0:7:45,765
I gotta film 7 different
people.


211
0:7:45,765 --> 0:7:47,82
I hope I can get can
get the footage.


212
0:7:47,82 --> 0:7:50,18
Film for a year.


213
0:7:50,18 --> 0:7:51,69
-Did you like it better then?


214
0:7:51,69 --> 0:7:52,63
-I liked it better then.


215
0:7:52,63 --> 0:7:54,98
It seemed more like I was just
skating and all of a sudden, I


216
0:7:54,98 --> 0:7:57,66
had a video part.


217
0:7:57,66 --> 0:7:58,1
-Yeah.


218
0:7:58,1 --> 0:8:2,22
I remember being super psyched
on the hard flip over this


219
0:8:2,22 --> 0:8:3,875
little gap that he did.


220
0:8:3,875 --> 0:8:5,62
It was super slick looking.


221
0:8:5,62 --> 0:8:7,226
-The worst hard flip
ever documented?


222
0:8:7,226 --> 0:8:9,62
-What's so bad about it?


223
0:8:9,62 --> 0:8:11,12
It was the first
one ever done.


224
0:8:11,12 --> 0:8:13,37
-It was the first, but
it was the worst.


225
0:8:13,37 --> 0:8:14,56
So it's cool.


226
0:8:14,56 --> 0:8:17,24
So it's like first and worst.


227
0:8:17,24 --> 0:8:18,78
Back then too, I didn't
even know what it was.


228
0:8:18,78 --> 0:8:21,27
All I know is I had to mule kick
the fuck out of my back,


229
0:8:21,27 --> 0:8:23,405
front foot and just move
it out of the way.


230
0:8:23,405 --> 0:8:25,6
And if you shot a photo, there
would definitely be three


231
0:8:25,6 --> 0:8:30,15
frames of just something that
just did not look right.


232
0:8:30,15 --> 0:8:32,36
-But you had never heard of
anyone doing that trick?


233
0:8:32,36 --> 0:8:32,84
-No.


234
0:8:32,84 --> 0:8:33,9
You know what?


235
0:8:33,9 --> 0:8:35,73
I actually did here one
person who did it.


236
0:8:35,73 --> 0:8:37,65
This guy Dan Gallagher.


237
0:8:37,65 --> 0:8:40,11
Rodney was saying he
thinks he did it.


238
0:8:40,11 --> 0:8:42,149
And I'm pretty sure he did do
it, but I don't want to give


239
0:8:42,149 --> 0:8:43,84
him full credit.


240
0:8:43,84 --> 0:8:47,67
But who got it on footage
first over a huge gap?


241
0:8:47,67 --> 0:8:50,21
You got your fish with
you because--


242
0:8:50,21 --> 0:8:50,54
There's borough.


243
0:8:50,54 --> 0:8:53,75
God, they need a gardener.


244
0:8:53,75 --> 0:8:58,8
This was a really popular
spot back in like '93.


245
0:8:58,8 --> 0:9:3,11
This place is like one place
like it goes way back from


246
0:9:3,11 --> 0:9:8,81
like the "Rubbish Heap" Jeremy
Klein days where he came here


247
0:9:8,81 --> 0:9:10,78
and I think, did the
best stuff ever.


248
0:9:10,78 --> 0:9:15,5



249
0:9:15,5 --> 0:9:18,33
-They put a pole at the bottom
of the one that everybody used


250
0:9:18,33 --> 0:9:20,42
to skate, and we still
skated it.


251
0:9:20,42 --> 0:9:24,63
Jeremy Klein had some stuff in
it a long time ago in old


252
0:9:24,63 --> 0:9:28,6
video and then now, they put
poles all over, and put those


253
0:9:28,6 --> 0:9:29,64
benches to really
just kill it.


254
0:9:29,64 --> 0:9:32,626
-Rick Howard had a bunch of
stuff that was good too.


255
0:9:32,626 --> 0:9:34,565
-Rick Howard had a
cover switch 360?


256
0:9:34,565 --> 0:9:34,99
-Yeah.


257
0:9:34,99 --> 0:9:36,18
It was on that wall.


258
0:9:36,18 --> 0:9:39,12
Gino actually had like a fakie
hard that was amazing and then


259
0:9:39,12 --> 0:9:45,7
this is what we call the vortex,
the V. And there was a


260
0:9:45,7 --> 0:9:46,4
lot of stuff they
went down here.


261
0:9:46,4 --> 0:9:48,67
Jeremy Klein did some stuff that
was, he did like front


262
0:9:48,67 --> 0:9:49,95
side flip in the birdhouse
video.


263
0:9:49,95 --> 0:9:52,95
I know he did backside flip.


264
0:9:52,95 --> 0:9:55,31
The main bank that everybody
skated was the one right next


265
0:9:55,31 --> 0:9:57,47
that railing.


266
0:9:57,47 --> 0:10:0,56
That's the main one.


267
0:10:0,56 --> 0:10:3,44
If you watch like the old video
in "New World Order"


268
0:10:3,44 --> 0:10:5,89
where Daniel is sitting at the
top of that bank over there,


269
0:10:5,89 --> 0:10:9,4
and I do some weird trick where
I didn't hit my tail.


270
0:10:9,4 --> 0:10:11,7
Hey, everybody did the Howard
Hail right there and then you


271
0:10:11,7 --> 0:10:12,54
were talking.


272
0:10:12,54 --> 0:10:14,646
That was the first try
but I hit my tail.


273
0:10:14,646 --> 0:10:18,63
That was fucking sick, man.


274
0:10:18,63 --> 0:10:20,9
Skating is sick.


275
0:10:20,9 --> 0:10:23,441
He's the best in the world.


276
0:10:23,441 --> 0:10:23,85
Yeah.


277
0:10:23,85 --> 0:10:26,707
I would never leave my area,
plus well, back then I felt as


278
0:10:26,707 --> 0:10:29,36
though everything was right
at your front door.


279
0:10:29,36 --> 0:10:33,9
You don't have to go
far for curves.


280
0:10:33,9 --> 0:10:36,24
People we're traveling around
the world for curves?


281
0:10:36,24 --> 0:10:37,36
This is Alta Vista.


282
0:10:37,36 --> 0:10:39,77
The curve is still waxed.


283
0:10:39,77 --> 0:10:41,53
See, I got to get out
and try to hard flip


284
0:10:41,53 --> 0:10:42,885
it and 5-0 it again.


285
0:10:42,885 --> 0:10:44,83
Should we stop and get out?


286
0:10:44,83 --> 0:10:44,927
-Yeah.


287
0:10:44,927 --> 0:10:45,22
Let's get out.


288
0:10:45,22 --> 0:10:48,54
-Tim Gammond had a fakie tre,
fake nose grind going on here.


289
0:10:48,54 --> 0:10:49,79
Insane.


290
0:10:49,79 --> 0:10:52,45



291
0:10:52,45 --> 0:10:54,72
Actually, we should be coming
here on those days where we


292
0:10:54,72 --> 0:10:55,88
have nowhere to go.


293
0:10:55,88 --> 0:10:58,48
This one was in "New World
Order." So there was like a


294
0:10:58,48 --> 0:10:59,1
hard flip [INAUDIBLE]


295
0:10:59,1 --> 0:11:0,34
180 and there was a--


296
0:11:0,34 --> 0:11:2,4
Everything was filmed from
pretty much that angle to


297
0:11:2,4 --> 0:11:3,4
where you're at.


298
0:11:3,4 --> 0:11:5,33
Thing is huge still.


299
0:11:5,33 --> 0:11:6,84
You got a marker because
I want to write


300
0:11:6,84 --> 0:11:9,131
down what's been done.


301
0:11:9,131 --> 0:11:10,83
Don't you hate hate that?


302
0:11:10,83 --> 0:11:12,87
I've been to so many spots where
people write down what


303
0:11:12,87 --> 0:11:13,69
they've done.


304
0:11:13,69 --> 0:11:17,0
It's me like when there is steep
walls are something like


305
0:11:17,0 --> 0:11:19,36
tail block, back side
tail block.


306
0:11:19,36 --> 0:11:21,615
What did Richard have on it?


307
0:11:21,615 --> 0:11:24,29
I know I can't remember anything
Richard had, man.


308
0:11:24,29 --> 0:11:26,68
Richard had so much stuff
it's hard to remember.


309
0:11:26,68 --> 0:11:28,75
Didn't you lose your virginity
here, Daniel?


310
0:11:28,75 --> 0:11:30,19
I'm just playing.


311
0:11:30,19 --> 0:11:31,8
-Yeah, right.


312
0:11:31,8 --> 0:11:34,9
You lost your virginity
at Kareem's.


313
0:11:34,9 --> 0:11:35,36
Yeah, I did the world parks.


314
0:11:35,36 --> 0:11:38,5
The craziest stuff would
happen at that place.


315
0:11:38,5 --> 0:11:40,56
So many random chicks
would show up and--


316
0:11:40,56 --> 0:11:41,26
-There was quarter pipes.


317
0:11:41,26 --> 0:11:44,25
-There was quarter pipes they
had the beast wall like there


318
0:11:44,25 --> 0:11:45,9
was actually a bunch of
stuff like this big


319
0:11:45,9 --> 0:11:47,15
six foot mini ramp.


320
0:11:47,15 --> 0:11:50,4



321
0:11:50,4 --> 0:11:54,89
In '92 and '93, that's where
I think the most innovative


322
0:11:54,89 --> 0:11:57,86
skating went down within like
Gino and Mike Keenan and


323
0:11:57,86 --> 0:12:0,94
everybody and you just see the
craziest stuff going down.


324
0:12:0,94 --> 0:12:3,32
You actually watched somebody
do something new.


325
0:12:3,32 --> 0:12:4,1
You know what I mean?


326
0:12:4,1 --> 0:12:5,29
That was crazy.


327
0:12:5,29 --> 0:12:7,55
I'm sure we've stayed in every
one of these little motels.


328
0:12:7,55 --> 0:12:10,22
Rocko used to put
us in like, yep.


329
0:12:10,22 --> 0:12:11,55
You guys are staying here.


330
0:12:11,55 --> 0:12:14,8
He would just put us in random
places or just give us money,


331
0:12:14,8 --> 0:12:17,31
like one dude money the oldest
one, which was probably like


332
0:12:17,31 --> 0:12:21,36
15, the responsibility
to get us a room.


333
0:12:21,36 --> 0:12:23,91
And then once the World part
came along, that's when it


334
0:12:23,91 --> 0:12:27,65
ended up being in like a
little place to stay.


335
0:12:27,65 --> 0:12:29,58
Remember the Imperial
double set?


336
0:12:29,58 --> 0:12:32,37
Dude, Daniel calling it out.


337
0:12:32,37 --> 0:12:34,77
Jeremy Wray all he
did flawless.


338
0:12:34,77 --> 0:12:35,64
He was Jeremy Wray though.


339
0:12:35,64 --> 0:12:37,96
He could probably backside
flip it now.


340
0:12:37,96 --> 0:12:40,84
I only did it with Sock filming
but, it was like when


341
0:12:40,84 --> 0:12:43,35
you ollie, and you lean
back and one leg


342
0:12:43,35 --> 0:12:44,85
goes up, and I fell.


343
0:12:44,85 --> 0:12:48,27
And I remember telling Sock
you can't cut it.


344
0:12:48,27 --> 0:12:49,92
It's so funny asking somebody
that question,


345
0:12:49,92 --> 0:12:51,88
like can you cut it?


346
0:12:51,88 --> 0:12:54,984
Hey, is this how Wallenburg
looks, like one more?


347
0:12:54,984 --> 0:12:56,43
-Vista, you ever been there?


348
0:12:56,43 --> 0:12:57,32
-No.


349
0:12:57,32 --> 0:12:57,77
Yeah.


350
0:12:57,77 --> 0:13:0,94
He's kept himself in like the
whole South Bay area his


351
0:13:0,94 --> 0:13:5,31
entire life as far as
skateboarding goes.


352
0:13:5,31 --> 0:13:8,21
I look back at like think of
all the video footage and


353
0:13:8,21 --> 0:13:11,17
stuff from just the
years past.


354
0:13:11,17 --> 0:13:12,63
It's all there.


355
0:13:12,63 --> 0:13:15,45
I don't think I've really
noticed it too.


356
0:13:15,45 --> 0:13:16,92
Do it where you want to.


357
0:13:16,92 --> 0:13:18,6
That's what I say.


358
0:13:18,6 --> 0:13:20,23
-There's a place like after
I kick jumped it in "Love


359
0:13:20,23 --> 0:13:23,79
Child," we came back and I tried
to front side flip it.


360
0:13:23,79 --> 0:13:26,22
And then the board, I don't
know if Sock still has the


361
0:13:26,22 --> 0:13:29,22
footage, but I stepped on the
nose and it completely smacked


362
0:13:29,22 --> 0:13:30,21
me in my face.


363
0:13:30,21 --> 0:13:34,875
Jeremy Wray really killed that
thing, fakie hill, front side


364
0:13:34,875 --> 0:13:37,91
flip, narly back side
flip, everything.


365
0:13:37,91 --> 0:13:39,38
See?


366
0:13:39,38 --> 0:13:40,59
It's pretty long because
he took three


367
0:13:40,59 --> 0:13:42,69
steps on the flat part.


368
0:13:42,69 --> 0:13:44,91
Pretty tall guy too.


369
0:13:44,91 --> 0:13:46,48
This thing's huge.


370
0:13:46,48 --> 0:13:49,88
Guy switch tre-ed one day
and some do but he


371
0:13:49,88 --> 0:13:53,9
forgot to film it.


372
0:13:53,9 --> 0:13:57,27
Guy was probably like
ah, oh, well.


373
0:13:57,27 --> 0:14:0,35
-I think I did it once
without filming.


374
0:14:0,35 --> 0:14:4,79
I went back to film it and I
think maybe it took a lot of


375
0:14:4,79 --> 0:14:6,69
tries and the cameraman ran
out of batteries, so the


376
0:14:6,69 --> 0:14:9,22
footage got messed
up or something.


377
0:14:9,22 --> 0:14:14,28
And it is very important to
document this stuff, but it's


378
0:14:14,28 --> 0:14:16,71
not what it's all about.


379
0:14:16,71 --> 0:14:17,62
-It's nut.


380
0:14:17,62 --> 0:14:20,74
I ain't going out to launch
at the top of this baby.


381
0:14:20,74 --> 0:14:24,6
And they even made a baby ramp
too. they made like a 3 and


382
0:14:24,6 --> 0:14:25,52
1/2 foot kicker.


383
0:14:25,52 --> 0:14:29,57
When they go, they go big.


384
0:14:29,57 --> 0:14:32,93
To switch tre though
that's nuts.


385
0:14:32,93 --> 0:14:34,53
And at that time too.


386
0:14:34,53 --> 0:14:36,29
-What year was that?


387
0:14:36,29 --> 0:14:39,71
-That was like '93, right?


388
0:14:39,71 --> 0:14:40,87
'93.


389
0:14:40,87 --> 0:14:42,76
Well, it was underground
at the same time too.


390
0:14:42,76 --> 0:14:44,95
And you had to wait a
year and a half to


391
0:14:44,95 --> 0:14:46,54
ever see any new skating.


392
0:14:46,54 --> 0:14:47,63
We didn't have YouTube.


393
0:14:47,63 --> 0:14:48,88
We didn't have--


394
0:14:48,88 --> 0:14:51,1



395
0:14:51,1 --> 0:14:53,53
you couldn't just go to
somebody's site and watch all


396
0:14:53,53 --> 0:14:57,9
this new footage that came
out within the last week.


397
0:14:57,9 --> 0:14:59,1
So we're headed to the
imperial blocks.


398
0:14:59,1 --> 0:15:4,8
These were the hub for
us in '92 and '93.


399
0:15:4,8 --> 0:15:5,595
Now, we used to skate
these ones.


400
0:15:5,595 --> 0:15:6,48
Oh, wait.


401
0:15:6,48 --> 0:15:7,73
Was it those ones?


402
0:15:7,73 --> 0:15:11,38



403
0:15:11,38 --> 0:15:12,78
Pretty nuts.


404
0:15:12,78 --> 0:15:16,49
Coming back to spots like this
and thinking about all the


405
0:15:16,49 --> 0:15:20,13
stuff you couldn't do and still
can't do, probably.


406
0:15:20,13 --> 0:15:22,6
I tried a lot of shit I couldn't
do but there was a


407
0:15:22,6 --> 0:15:25,85
couple of guys that came here
and was I think Rick was


408
0:15:25,85 --> 0:15:28,86
trying to do a front to half
calf grip crooked grind, maybe


409
0:15:28,86 --> 0:15:30,77
or some back in those
days, which was nuts


410
0:15:30,77 --> 0:15:32,53
to even think about.


411
0:15:32,53 --> 0:15:35,64
And then in the plan B day
we had front to calf


412
0:15:35,64 --> 0:15:36,91
flipped the hard way.


413
0:15:36,91 --> 0:15:39,41
So like a back 50 or 5-0.


414
0:15:39,41 --> 0:15:41,86
I think Henry Hambertino did
backs 180 hill fakie nose


415
0:15:41,86 --> 0:15:43,52
grind on that one.


416
0:15:43,52 --> 0:15:46,41
Switching on hill, switch 5-0,
that's pretty nuts too.


417
0:15:46,41 --> 0:15:49,82
It's so funny how so much stuff
went down like that back


418
0:15:49,82 --> 0:15:52,6
then, but you've seen so much
crazy stuff like that back


419
0:15:52,6 --> 0:15:55,81
then that nothing really,
everything just went by.


420
0:15:55,81 --> 0:15:58,42
It wasn't like you had one
good thing in your part.


421
0:15:58,42 --> 0:16:0,58
You watched people's parts
and everything was good.


422
0:16:0,58 --> 0:16:2,12
So you're just like, yeah, that
was good, that was good,


423
0:16:2,12 --> 0:16:2,83
that was good, that was good.


424
0:16:2,83 --> 0:16:3,48
His part's over.


425
0:16:3,48 --> 0:16:5,12
OK.


426
0:16:5,12 --> 0:16:9,74
Like '94 to '95, I
just was over it.


427
0:16:9,74 --> 0:16:11,39
Hung out at Long Beach
all the time.


428
0:16:11,39 --> 0:16:13,73
Shiloh had told me later,
like Rodney an them were


429
0:16:13,73 --> 0:16:14,4
hitting them up.


430
0:16:14,4 --> 0:16:15,61
Like Daewon's not
skating anymore.


431
0:16:15,61 --> 0:16:18,46
He's doing something else and
Rodney was telling Shiloh


432
0:16:18,46 --> 0:16:19,795
like, hey, we might have
to kick him off.


433
0:16:19,795 --> 0:16:21,64
And Shiloh was telling
them, you can't


434
0:16:21,64 --> 0:16:23,13
kick Daewon off, man.


435
0:16:23,13 --> 0:16:23,69
He'll skate.


436
0:16:23,69 --> 0:16:24,81
He's going to skate.


437
0:16:24,81 --> 0:16:26,5
And I came back and
called Rodney.


438
0:16:26,5 --> 0:16:29,0
I was like look, I'm sorry for
not being around, but I'm back


439
0:16:29,0 --> 0:16:31,31
and I'm going to try to
work on trying to


440
0:16:31,31 --> 0:16:31,96
get something going.


441
0:16:31,96 --> 0:16:33,65
You know what I mean?


442
0:16:33,65 --> 0:16:36,41
-I always knew that that guy
can't he probably could never


443
0:16:36,41 --> 0:16:39,6
quit skating.


444
0:16:39,6 --> 0:16:41,86
He loves to do it so much.


445
0:16:41,86 --> 0:16:44,48
And that's when we started
filming and I did the whole


446
0:16:44,48 --> 0:16:45,43
"Trilogy" part.


447
0:16:45,43 --> 0:16:46,84
It put me back on the map.


448
0:16:46,84 --> 0:16:48,61
You know what I mean?


449
0:16:48,61 --> 0:16:50,24
There was nothing left
to really skate.


450
0:16:50,24 --> 0:16:51,38
Everything got skate stopped.


451
0:16:51,38 --> 0:16:54,1
Everything got blocked, all
the curbs just were curbs.


452
0:16:54,1 --> 0:16:58,1
Ended up going to some school
putting tables downstairs and


453
0:16:58,1 --> 0:16:59,61
we never got hassled.


454
0:16:59,61 --> 0:17:1,92
So I was like look, I guess this
is where it's all going


455
0:17:1,92 --> 0:17:2,6
to happen now.


456
0:17:2,6 --> 0:17:5,71
It was almost like a new
type of skating for me.


457
0:17:5,71 --> 0:17:8,53
Like now I'm going
to focus on this.


458
0:17:8,53 --> 0:17:8,89
-Yeah.


459
0:17:8,89 --> 0:17:12,819
I remember later then seeing
footage of Daewon.


460
0:17:12,819 --> 0:17:15,28
I thought they said he didn't
skate anymore, and he was


461
0:17:15,28 --> 0:17:17,44
fucking ripping.


462
0:17:17,44 --> 0:17:20,6
I remember when he was doing
all the picnic table shit.


463
0:17:20,6 --> 0:17:23,97
But I mean I always thought
he was gnarly, you know?


464
0:17:23,97 --> 0:17:27,64
But there's only so many picnic
tables you can see.


465
0:17:27,64 --> 0:17:28,86
-I got a lot of shit
for the picnic


466
0:17:28,86 --> 0:17:30,11
table thing for a while.


467
0:17:30,11 --> 0:17:33,3
There was no way of how people
try to erase things out of


468
0:17:33,3 --> 0:17:35,76
their life, and that will be
there forever to haunt me,


469
0:17:35,76 --> 0:17:37,85
which I'm not ashamed of it.


470
0:17:37,85 --> 0:17:42,8
I used to love the whole picnic
table thing, but it got


471
0:17:42,8 --> 0:17:44,17
a little too overboard.


472
0:17:44,17 --> 0:17:47,43
I went on tour and my nickname
because in Australia was like


473
0:17:47,43 --> 0:17:50,18
the picnic table wizard.


474
0:17:50,18 --> 0:17:52,1
They would have picnic
table specifically


475
0:17:52,1 --> 0:17:53,55
there so when I came.


476
0:17:53,55 --> 0:17:55,16
I remember one of the guys came
up to me and was like,


477
0:17:55,16 --> 0:17:56,966
Daewon man, I'm still glad
you're here, man.


478
0:17:56,966 --> 0:18:0,3
I'm sorry we couldn't get
you the picnic tables.


479
0:18:0,3 --> 0:18:2,41
I was like, well, God damn
it, there's nothing


480
0:18:2,41 --> 0:18:3,35
I can do here then.


481
0:18:3,35 --> 0:18:4,24
I'm out.


482
0:18:4,24 --> 0:18:6,38
But my whole problem is I get
caught up and I over do it


483
0:18:6,38 --> 0:18:7,335
like eating too much cake.


484
0:18:7,335 --> 0:18:9,49
If you give me a whole cake,
I'll eat the whole thing, and


485
0:18:9,49 --> 0:18:10,61
it drives people nuts.


486
0:18:10,61 --> 0:18:12,2
Like dude, please no more.


487
0:18:12,2 --> 0:18:15,92
-He was real crazy into
like the benches.


488
0:18:15,92 --> 0:18:19,78
-Yeah, I hit those spots, but
like the way this guy looks at


489
0:18:19,78 --> 0:18:21,1
shit is so crazy.


490
0:18:21,1 --> 0:18:23,5
Like he would be oh,
you could skate.


491
0:18:23,5 --> 0:18:25,56
I made this spot and you could
skate like this and that.


492
0:18:25,56 --> 0:18:26,71
And I'll look at the spot.


493
0:18:26,71 --> 0:18:30,9
I'm like, how did you even get
that from-- you know I don't


494
0:18:30,9 --> 0:18:31,68
look at it like that.


495
0:18:31,68 --> 0:18:33,48
He'll take it to the
extreme, man.


496
0:18:33,48 --> 0:18:36,3
I I think that's the
way he does things.


497
0:18:36,3 --> 0:18:40,74
He gets into something, and he
just sticks with it till he


498
0:18:40,74 --> 0:18:42,2
burns it out for himself.


499
0:18:42,2 --> 0:18:45,68
-Honestly, he's on a different
level than anybody.


500
0:18:45,68 --> 0:18:49,33
There's only like a few guys out
there that are like at the


501
0:18:49,33 --> 0:18:52,75
same level like Costen and
Reynolds and those kind of


502
0:18:52,75 --> 0:18:53,15
guys, you know.


503
0:18:53,15 --> 0:18:59,43
And then there's things like
the middle like me.


504
0:18:59,43 --> 0:19:1,48
Daewon is definitely
on the top.


505
0:19:1,48 --> 0:19:5,21
-"Round Three," he skated those
top of those fucking big


506
0:19:5,21 --> 0:19:6,34
rigs, right?


507
0:19:6,34 --> 0:19:10,87
And he was telling me oh, I'm
doing this big rig thing.


508
0:19:10,87 --> 0:19:13,883
You should come down, dude,
like just back heel it.


509
0:19:13,883 --> 0:19:14,769
I'm like what?


510
0:19:14,769 --> 0:19:16,99
Like hell, no.


511
0:19:16,99 --> 0:19:19,26
That shit is like
death defying.


512
0:19:19,26 --> 0:19:22,36
-I've been just trying
to have fun with it.


513
0:19:22,36 --> 0:19:24,31
It's really easy to stay
motivated as long as you just


514
0:19:24,31 --> 0:19:26,16
kind of put yourself
in a new place.


515
0:19:26,16 --> 0:19:27,85
Like for me, the whole "Cheese
and Crackers" thing, that was


516
0:19:27,85 --> 0:19:30,6
just all fun, three months of
just fun, and we ended up


517
0:19:30,6 --> 0:19:31,295
getting a video out of it.


518
0:19:31,295 --> 0:19:33,54
But that's how "Love
Child" was.


519
0:19:33,54 --> 0:19:36,118
-So you think something like
"Cheese and Crackers" couldn't


520
0:19:36,118 --> 0:19:37,36
have come out in like
the mid '90s?


521
0:19:37,36 --> 0:19:37,525
-No.


522
0:19:37,525 --> 0:19:39,55
I don't think nobody would have
cared and plus when they


523
0:19:39,55 --> 0:19:43,63
said vert died, in those days
it really did, even anything


524
0:19:43,63 --> 0:19:46,67
to do with it, even if it was
just mini ramper tranny,


525
0:19:46,67 --> 0:19:47,57
people were dead serious.


526
0:19:47,57 --> 0:19:49,84
Like nobody wanted to see it.


527
0:19:49,84 --> 0:19:52,93
Costen, he did a 360 tail
grab fakie nose


528
0:19:52,93 --> 0:19:55,12
grind revert in a video.


529
0:19:55,12 --> 0:19:57,57
People don't talk about that.


530
0:19:57,57 --> 0:20:1,69
It's come back to that point now
where I think tranny, it's


531
0:20:1,69 --> 0:20:2,705
cool again.


532
0:20:2,705 --> 0:20:4,685
-Is your trucks always
like that, loose?


533
0:20:4,685 --> 0:20:5,935
-M-hm.


534
0:20:5,935 --> 0:20:8,15



535
0:20:8,15 --> 0:20:9,25
-Is that just how
you skate 'em?


536
0:20:9,25 --> 0:20:9,85
-M-hm.


537
0:20:9,85 --> 0:20:12,38
-I always think like tech
skating you have to have tight


538
0:20:12,38 --> 0:20:12,83
trucks.


539
0:20:12,83 --> 0:20:15,5
-That's what everybody thinks,
but I couldn't do a nose


540
0:20:15,5 --> 0:20:18,94
tranny unless my truck
was that loose.


541
0:20:18,94 --> 0:20:20,886
Plus these days, I don't know.


542
0:20:20,886 --> 0:20:23,23
-I think Rodriguez has
his trucks like that.


543
0:20:23,23 --> 0:20:26,194
-He has both, because only
one of mine is like that.


544
0:20:26,194 --> 0:20:28,514
-And the other one's tight?


545
0:20:28,514 --> 0:20:30,37
Whoa.


546
0:20:30,37 --> 0:20:33,21
-Now, Rodriguez has both.


547
0:20:33,21 --> 0:20:35,17
That dude's nuts.


548
0:20:35,17 --> 0:20:39,45
It's just nuts that like there's
people out there are


549
0:20:39,45 --> 0:20:41,66
so good at one thing, but
they're afraid to admit it.


550
0:20:41,66 --> 0:20:44,48
There's a couple of pros right
now that are afraid to admit


551
0:20:44,48 --> 0:20:46,986
that they good at vert
or to admit that they


552
0:20:46,986 --> 0:20:47,59
used to skate vert.


553
0:20:47,59 --> 0:20:49,1
I'm not going to say any
names, but you guys


554
0:20:49,1 --> 0:20:51,61
know who you are.


555
0:20:51,61 --> 0:20:53,62
One dude is not afraid
though is Channie.


556
0:20:53,62 --> 0:22:53,62
