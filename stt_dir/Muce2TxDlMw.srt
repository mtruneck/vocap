2
0:0:1,962 --> 0:0:3,42
CHADE-MENG TAN:
Morning, everybody.


3
0:0:3,42 --> 0:0:4,97
Thank you all for being here.


4
0:0:4,97 --> 0:0:6,6
My name is Meng.


5
0:0:6,6 --> 0:0:8,32
I'm the Jolly Good
Fellow of Google,


6
0:0:8,32 --> 0:0:11,255
and I'm delighted to be
here with my friend Shawn,


7
0:0:11,255 --> 0:0:15,1
a fellow Jolly Good
Fellow and also


8
0:0:15,1 --> 0:0:17,98
a fellow international
bestselling author,


9
0:0:17,98 --> 0:0:20,57
whose latest book is
"Before Happiness,"


10
0:0:20,57 --> 0:0:22,2
available at all
major bookstores.


11
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:25,65



12
0:0:25,65 --> 0:0:28,36
The first thing you need
to know about Shawn Achor


13
0:0:28,36 --> 0:0:32,6
is that he is
genuinely really nice.


14
0:0:32,6 --> 0:0:34,47
You know about his
public persona.


15
0:0:34,47 --> 0:0:36,75
He's that nice,
smiling, happy guy.


16
0:0:36,75 --> 0:0:39,804
And in person, he
is really that guy.


17
0:0:39,804 --> 0:0:41,22
So that's the first
thing you need


18
0:0:41,22 --> 0:0:45,49
to know about him, genuinely
beautiful human being.


19
0:0:45,49 --> 0:0:47,54
The second thing you
need to know about Shawn


20
0:0:47,54 --> 0:0:51,8
is that he has one of the
most popular TED Talks


21
0:0:51,8 --> 0:0:56,3
ever, almost 6 million
views the last I checked,


22
0:0:56,3 --> 0:0:58,42
like 5.9 million or something.


23
0:0:58,42 --> 0:1:1,3
So if he has $1 per
view, he's going


24
0:1:1,3 --> 0:1:2,49
to be the Six
Million Dollar Man.


25
0:1:2,49 --> 0:1:6,8
He's going to run in
slow motion all the time.


26
0:1:6,8 --> 0:1:10,33
His lectures airing on PBS
have been seen by millions.


27
0:1:10,33 --> 0:1:16,23
He is the winner of a dozen
Distinguished Teaching Awards


28
0:1:16,23 --> 0:1:18,28
at Harvard University,
a fairly good university


29
0:1:18,28 --> 0:1:20,282
the last I heard.


30
0:1:20,282 --> 0:1:22,14
Just kidding.


31
0:1:22,14 --> 0:1:25,51
Shawn is one of the
world's leading experts


32
0:1:25,51 --> 0:1:29,4
on the connection between
happiness and success,


33
0:1:29,4 --> 0:1:32,59
and he has traveled
to 50 countries.


34
0:1:32,59 --> 0:1:34,15
The first 49, it's kind of meh.


35
0:1:34,15 --> 0:1:37,2
But 50, that was impressive.


36
0:1:37,2 --> 0:1:40,18
With that, my friends, please
welcome my friend Shawn A.


37
0:1:40,18 --> 0:1:43,168
SHAWN ACHOR: Thank you.


38
0:1:43,168 --> 0:1:45,66
Thank you, everyone.


39
0:1:45,66 --> 0:1:47,494
CHADE-MENG TAN: So thank
you for being here.


40
0:1:47,494 --> 0:1:49,118
I've been looking
forward to having you


41
0:1:49,118 --> 0:1:50,17
for a really long time.


42
0:1:50,17 --> 0:1:51,2
SHAWN ACHOR: Me too.


43
0:1:51,2 --> 0:1:52,2
I'm absolutely thrilled.


44
0:1:52,2 --> 0:1:53,88
And thank you so
much for coming out.


45
0:1:53,88 --> 0:1:58,484
It makes it so much more fun to
have even all the people that


46
0:1:58,484 --> 0:1:59,4
are being streamed in.


47
0:1:59,4 --> 0:2:1,229
So thank you.


48
0:2:1,229 --> 0:2:3,77
CHADE-MENG TAN: So this is going
to be purely a conversation.


49
0:2:3,77 --> 0:2:6,84
Q&A is a composition
between us and Shawn.


50
0:2:6,84 --> 0:2:9,84
And I'm just going ask a
couple questions, and about


51
0:2:9,84 --> 0:2:11,97
halfway into this
conversation we're


52
0:2:11,97 --> 0:2:14,3
going to invite you
to ask him questions.


53
0:2:14,3 --> 0:2:15,819
Feel free to embarrass him.


54
0:2:15,819 --> 0:2:16,61
Don't embarrass me.


55
0:2:16,61 --> 0:2:18,79
Embarrass this guy.


56
0:2:18,79 --> 0:2:23,69
So Shawn, my first question
for you a very simple question,


57
0:2:23,69 --> 0:2:25,165
how do you define happiness?


58
0:2:25,165 --> 0:2:27,357



59
0:2:27,357 --> 0:2:29,44
SHAWN ACHOR: It's actually
pretty difficult for us


60
0:2:29,44 --> 0:2:31,77
to define it.


61
0:2:31,77 --> 0:2:34,86
As Meng mentioned,
I've traveled to now


62
0:2:34,86 --> 0:2:37,34
over 50 countries over
the past seven years


63
0:2:37,34 --> 0:2:39,277
studying happiness,
which is great.


64
0:2:39,277 --> 0:2:41,36
And one of the things that
I realized very quickly


65
0:2:41,36 --> 0:2:43,47
was that everyone had
a different definition


66
0:2:43,47 --> 0:2:47,17
of happiness, What they
thought would create happiness,


67
0:2:47,17 --> 0:2:49,74
the triggers for
happiness seemed


68
0:2:49,74 --> 0:2:50,99
to be different based
upon different cultures,


69
0:2:50,99 --> 0:2:53,83
different individuals, even
at the same organization.


70
0:2:53,83 --> 0:2:56,8
So if you can't define
it, maybe can't study it.


71
0:2:56,8 --> 0:2:58,345
And if you can't
study it, then we


72
0:2:58,345 --> 0:3:0,95
can't have things like
positive psychology


73
0:3:0,95 --> 0:3:2,45
that are looking at how do
we raise levels of happiness


74
0:3:2,45 --> 0:3:3,81
for other people.


75
0:3:3,81 --> 0:3:6,114
Part of what we found is
that even though everyone


76
0:3:6,114 --> 0:3:7,53
in this room and
everyone watching


77
0:3:7,53 --> 0:3:10,31
has different
definitions of happiness,


78
0:3:10,31 --> 0:3:12,27
if I ask you on a
scale of 1 to 10


79
0:3:12,27 --> 0:3:15,34
how happy you felt over the
past two weeks, most of us


80
0:3:15,34 --> 0:3:17,39
can kind of put ourselves
on that spectrum.


81
0:3:17,39 --> 0:3:21,615
We can put ourselves
somewhere on that range.


82
0:3:21,615 --> 0:3:23,84
What we found is that
even though that's


83
0:3:23,84 --> 0:3:26,55
a subjective experience,
if I go into a hospital


84
0:3:26,55 --> 0:3:29,22
with a broken arm, there's no
pain meter they can hook me


85
0:3:29,22 --> 0:3:33,9
up to that automatically means
I'm experiencing an 8 out


86
0:3:33,9 --> 0:3:36,92
of 10 on a pain scale, the
same thing is true happiness.


87
0:3:36,92 --> 0:3:38,605
We treat people
based upon the pain


88
0:3:38,605 --> 0:3:40,75
that they actually experience,
and we can actually


89
0:3:40,75 --> 0:3:44,0
study people based upon
their subjective experience


90
0:3:44,0 --> 0:3:46,17
of happiness that they're
experiencing in the world.


91
0:3:46,17 --> 0:3:48,419
Part of what I'm hoping to
do and part of the reason I


92
0:3:48,419 --> 0:3:51,26
wanted to come to
talk with you is


93
0:3:51,26 --> 0:3:54,43
that what I'd love for us to do
is to help the world redefine


94
0:3:54,43 --> 0:3:55,681
what happiness actually means.


95
0:3:55,681 --> 0:3:57,888
Because I think that there's
a lot of confusion about


96
0:3:57,888 --> 0:3:59,1
what happiness actually is.


97
0:3:59,1 --> 0:4:2,13
And if we do come up with a
definition that's aspirational,


98
0:4:2,13 --> 0:4:4,91
maybe we can start a movement
not only within our schools


99
0:4:4,91 --> 0:4:8,79
and in our families but in
our companies worldwide.


100
0:4:8,79 --> 0:4:11,21
There's a lot of articles
that are coming out right now


101
0:4:11,21 --> 0:4:14,8
talking about how
having a happy life


102
0:4:14,8 --> 0:4:17,12
and having a meaningful life
that a meaningful life is


103
0:4:17,12 --> 0:4:19,709
so much better than having
a happy life in terms


104
0:4:19,709 --> 0:4:23,15
of the levels of health you
experience in the long run.


105
0:4:23,15 --> 0:4:26,7
I think those studies,
while well-meaning,


106
0:4:26,7 --> 0:4:28,94
are actually leading us astray.


107
0:4:28,94 --> 0:4:30,83
Because I think it's
impossible for us


108
0:4:30,83 --> 0:4:33,4
to sustain happiness
without meaning.


109
0:4:33,4 --> 0:4:36,282
And as soon as we start to try
to define happiness in our life


110
0:4:36,282 --> 0:4:38,24
without having meaning,
all we're talking about


111
0:4:38,24 --> 0:4:39,12
is pleasure.


112
0:4:39,12 --> 0:4:41,34
And pleasure is very
short-term, right?


113
0:4:41,34 --> 0:4:43,84
We could put chocolate bars
in front of each of you,


114
0:4:43,84 --> 0:4:47,179
and then we'd be done in
terms of our happiness.


115
0:4:47,179 --> 0:4:49,47
Somebody's like, wait, was
that an option this morning?


116
0:4:49,47 --> 0:4:51,25
I didn't even know that
that would be an option.


117
0:4:51,25 --> 0:4:51,96
CHADE-MENG TAN: It's Google.


118
0:4:51,96 --> 0:4:52,73
It's always an option.


119
0:4:52,73 --> 0:4:53,605
SHAWN ACHOR: Exactly.


120
0:4:53,605 --> 0:4:54,286
Exactly.


121
0:4:54,286 --> 0:4:55,91
You've got pleasure
at your fingertips,


122
0:4:55,91 --> 0:4:58,243
but that doesn't necessarily
mean that you automatically


123
0:4:58,243 --> 0:4:59,74
have happiness at
your fingertips.


124
0:4:59,74 --> 0:5:1,69
Because happiness,
the way that we


125
0:5:1,69 --> 0:5:5,2
are hoping to start your
redefine this for the world


126
0:5:5,2 --> 0:5:6,99
is to not have
happiness be pleasure,


127
0:5:6,99 --> 0:5:8,48
because that's very short-term.


128
0:5:8,48 --> 0:5:9,425
And we get addicted to


129
0:5:9,425 --> 0:5:9,925
It.


130
0:5:9,925 --> 0:5:11,591
We were talking about
that this morning.


131
0:5:11,591 --> 0:5:14,22
If happiness is just a pleasure,
it becomes a trap, right?


132
0:5:14,22 --> 0:5:16,139
So if I'm not feeling
pleasure right now,


133
0:5:16,139 --> 0:5:17,43
well, then I must not be happy.


134
0:5:17,43 --> 0:5:18,79
Then I'm not going to
keep working at this,


135
0:5:18,79 --> 0:5:20,95
or I'm not going to keep
trying, because this


136
0:5:20,95 --> 0:5:21,92
is too difficult now.


137
0:5:21,92 --> 0:5:24,83
What I'm interested in is
how do we redefine happiness


138
0:5:24,83 --> 0:5:31,25
to be-- I stole this definition
from the ancient Greeks--


139
0:5:31,25 --> 0:5:34,97
the joy that we feel
striving for our potential?


140
0:5:34,97 --> 0:5:36,62
And I love this definition.


141
0:5:36,62 --> 0:5:38,65
I was at the Divinity
School before getting


142
0:5:38,65 --> 0:5:40,295
into studying
positive psychology,


143
0:5:40,295 --> 0:5:43,13
and I was studying Christian
and Buddhist ethics.


144
0:5:43,13 --> 0:5:45,25
Because I was interested
in how does the beliefs


145
0:5:45,25 --> 0:5:47,88
you have about the
world change the actions


146
0:5:47,88 --> 0:5:49,85
you decide to do
within that world.


147
0:5:49,85 --> 0:5:52,42
And one of the things that I
loved about this definition


148
0:5:52,42 --> 0:5:55,26
when I saw it is it changes the
way that we pursue happiness.


149
0:5:55,26 --> 0:5:56,954
Because if happiness
is just pleasure,


150
0:5:56,954 --> 0:5:58,87
we have to keep running
after it very quickly,


151
0:5:58,87 --> 0:6:0,97
and we know it's
not going to last.


152
0:6:0,97 --> 0:6:3,898
But if happiness is
joy, joy is something


153
0:6:3,898 --> 0:6:5,772
we can feel in the ups
and downs of our life.


154
0:6:5,772 --> 0:6:8,7
It's something we can experience
even when things are not


155
0:6:8,7 --> 0:6:10,5
pleasurable, when you're working
on a very difficult project,


156
0:6:10,5 --> 0:6:11,78
when you're going
for a difficult run,


157
0:6:11,78 --> 0:6:14,78
or when you're biking into
and it's a really long bike


158
0:6:14,78 --> 0:6:16,75
ride, whatever is it
you're experiencing.


159
0:6:16,75 --> 0:6:19,38
Even childbirth is not
a pleasurable experience


160
0:6:19,38 --> 0:6:21,54
all the time, but
you can actually


161
0:6:21,54 --> 0:6:23,75
feel joy in the midst of that.


162
0:6:23,75 --> 0:6:26,33
What I want people to do is
to recognize and to actually


163
0:6:26,33 --> 0:6:28,85
seek out that joy, which I know
is one of your pet projects


164
0:6:28,85 --> 0:6:29,67
as well.


165
0:6:29,67 --> 0:6:33,27
How do you see joy, but joy
that's connected to growth?


166
0:6:33,27 --> 0:6:36,55
Because if happiness is actually
disconnected from growth,


167
0:6:36,55 --> 0:6:39,7
it turns out we stagnate
and our happiness


168
0:6:39,7 --> 0:6:41,15
goes away pretty quickly.


169
0:6:41,15 --> 0:6:43,58
I love playing video games.


170
0:6:43,58 --> 0:6:44,58
I love them.


171
0:6:44,58 --> 0:6:49,4
And they're very high levels of
pleasure, and I'm OK at them.


172
0:6:49,4 --> 0:6:51,33
But in terms of
long-term meaning,


173
0:6:51,33 --> 0:6:53,0
there's not too much
for me in my life.


174
0:6:53,0 --> 0:6:54,83
Now for some people, there's a
lot of meaning in video games.


175
0:6:54,83 --> 0:6:56,29
But for me, not so much.


176
0:6:56,29 --> 0:6:58,54
So if I keep doing it, even
though I'm having pleasure


177
0:6:58,54 --> 0:7:0,71
that pleasure actually
dissipates after a while,


178
0:7:0,71 --> 0:7:3,62
because I'm not actually
pursuing any of my potential


179
0:7:3,62 --> 0:7:5,8
except within that one domain.


180
0:7:5,8 --> 0:7:7,47
The thing I love about
joy that we experience


181
0:7:7,47 --> 0:7:9,6
striving towards
our potential is


182
0:7:9,6 --> 0:7:10,51
that potential
could be anything.


183
0:7:10,51 --> 0:7:13,9
It could be as an entrepreneur,
as a business leader.


184
0:7:13,9 --> 0:7:19,2
It could be as a lover,
as a son, as a daughter,


185
0:7:19,2 --> 0:7:20,34
as a human being.


186
0:7:20,34 --> 0:7:22,4
And the more than we actually
strive towards that potential,


187
0:7:22,4 --> 0:7:24,191
that's where people
experience that greater


188
0:7:24,191 --> 0:7:25,73
levels of happiness,
and it allows


189
0:7:25,73 --> 0:7:29,15
us to stop making that disjunct
between happiness and success.


190
0:7:29,15 --> 0:7:32,11
Because I was out in Indonesia,
and I was speaking out


191
0:7:32,11 --> 0:7:33,362
at one of the factories there.


192
0:7:33,362 --> 0:7:35,32
And one of the managers
came up to me and said,


193
0:7:35,32 --> 0:7:37,97
this talk on happiness might
work at places like Google


194
0:7:37,97 --> 0:7:40,5
or it might work in
places in America,


195
0:7:40,5 --> 0:7:43,225
but seriously actually our
problem in our country is not


196
0:7:43,225 --> 0:7:44,46
that people are unhappy work.


197
0:7:44,46 --> 0:7:47,77
Our problem is sometimes
people are way too happy.


198
0:7:47,77 --> 0:7:51,46
Because I had this guy come into
work three hours late today,


199
0:7:51,46 --> 0:7:53,41
and I tried to yell at
him, and he was like,


200
0:7:53,41 --> 0:7:54,88
what are you doing?


201
0:7:54,88 --> 0:7:56,63
Let's just relax and
just enjoy ourselves.


202
0:7:56,63 --> 0:7:59,244
And I was like, that guy
didn't make me happy at all.


203
0:7:59,244 --> 0:8:1,66
But what he's talking about
there is not happiness, right?


204
0:8:1,66 --> 0:8:2,79
That's short-term pleasure.


205
0:8:2,79 --> 0:8:4,32
The guy decide to
stay home that morning


206
0:8:4,32 --> 0:8:6,653
and didn't do the work that
he was supposed to be doing.


207
0:8:6,653 --> 0:8:9,99
But if that's what
it is, then long-term


208
0:8:9,99 --> 0:8:11,39
his levels of happiness are
actually going to decrease.


209
0:8:11,39 --> 0:8:13,29
He's never going to get to
see what his potential was


210
0:8:13,29 --> 0:8:14,331
within that organization.


211
0:8:14,331 --> 0:8:16,39
He might not get to see
what his potential was


212
0:8:16,39 --> 0:8:20,95
in terms of applying his
self-control and his behavior


213
0:8:20,95 --> 0:8:21,65
to his task.


214
0:8:21,65 --> 0:8:23,8
So what we want people
to do is to recognize


215
0:8:23,8 --> 0:8:30,97
that that can be more
on the side of apathy.


216
0:8:30,97 --> 0:8:33,86
I think the opposite of
happiness is not unhappiness.


217
0:8:33,86 --> 0:8:37,28
The opposite of
happiness is apathy,


218
0:8:37,28 --> 0:8:39,62
which is the loss of joy that
we feel within our lives.


219
0:8:39,62 --> 0:8:42,49
Because if you think about
it, unhappiness can sometimes


220
0:8:42,49 --> 0:8:44,19
make us breakup with people
we shouldn't be dating.


221
0:8:44,19 --> 0:8:46,715
Or unhappiness can cause us
to move to do different jobs,


222
0:8:46,715 --> 0:8:49,84
or it can cause us to want to
get better grades in school.


223
0:8:49,84 --> 0:8:51,47
Unhappiness can be very helpful.


224
0:8:51,47 --> 0:8:53,97
What I think becomes
the problem is


225
0:8:53,97 --> 0:8:56,26
when we've lost that
joy in our life, when


226
0:8:56,26 --> 0:8:58,76
we lose that joy striving
towards our potential.


227
0:8:58,76 --> 0:9:0,85
So I think that there's a
revolution inside of us.


228
0:9:0,85 --> 0:9:3,285
If we can help people
realize that happiness is joy


229
0:9:3,285 --> 0:9:5,7
that we feel on the
way to our potential,


230
0:9:5,7 --> 0:9:7,88
some amazing things
start to change.


231
0:9:7,88 --> 0:9:9,3
CHADE-MENG TAN: Fascinating.


232
0:9:9,3 --> 0:9:11,63
It's especially
fascinating in the context


233
0:9:11,63 --> 0:9:14,87
of one of your teachings
from your previous book,


234
0:9:14,87 --> 0:9:17,65
which I thought was
ground-breaking.


235
0:9:17,65 --> 0:9:21,54
And when I first read it,
I was really impressed.


236
0:9:21,54 --> 0:9:24,23
In your previous book, which
is "The Happiness Advantage,"


237
0:9:24,23 --> 0:9:27,48
you talk about the relationship
between happiness and success.


238
0:9:27,48 --> 0:9:30,701
And you put it on
its head, the reverse


239
0:9:30,701 --> 0:9:32,2
of what everybody
else was thinking.


240
0:9:32,2 --> 0:9:32,47
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.


241
0:9:32,47 --> 0:9:33,8
CHADE-MENG TAN:
Which is everybody


242
0:9:33,8 --> 0:9:35,81
was thinking that if you're
successful, you're happy,


243
0:9:35,81 --> 0:9:38,125
which is basically the
premise of Asian parenting.


244
0:9:38,125 --> 0:9:38,916
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


245
0:9:38,916 --> 0:9:39,848
CHADE-MENG TAN: Right?


246
0:9:39,848 --> 0:9:43,11
Trust me, I know.


247
0:9:43,11 --> 0:9:45,7
But what you say,
and I agree with you,


248
0:9:45,7 --> 0:9:47,1
is that it's the reverse.


249
0:9:47,1 --> 0:9:51,58
It's that happiness
brings about success.


250
0:9:51,58 --> 0:9:53,5
So can you talk more about that?


251
0:9:53,5 --> 0:9:54,25
SHAWN ACHOR: Sure.


252
0:9:54,25 --> 0:9:59,28
So you guys might have heard
"The Battle Hymn of the Tiger


253
0:9:59,28 --> 0:10:1,95
Mother" book that came out
about tiger parenting, which


254
0:10:1,95 --> 0:10:4,34
is the style of parenting
you're describing,


255
0:10:4,34 --> 0:10:7,48
which is I'm going to
push you so far right now,


256
0:10:7,48 --> 0:10:10,21
and you're going to hate me for
it, but when you're successful,


257
0:10:10,21 --> 0:10:12,45
when you're off at
Harvard, Stanford,


258
0:10:12,45 --> 0:10:14,95
when you've got a good job,
then you're going to be happier.


259
0:10:14,95 --> 0:10:16,6
CHADE-MENG TAN: Right.


260
0:10:16,6 --> 0:10:18,309
SHAWN ACHOR: And it turns
out that that formula, which


261
0:10:18,309 --> 0:10:21,33
undergirds our managing styles
at most companies, our learning


262
0:10:21,33 --> 0:10:23,79
styles, our personal
development styles, it's


263
0:10:23,79 --> 0:10:27,27
scientifically broken and
backwards for two reasons.


264
0:10:27,27 --> 0:10:30,804
The first reason is that every
time your brain has a success--


265
0:10:30,804 --> 0:10:31,97
and you've experienced this.


266
0:10:31,97 --> 0:10:33,511
Everyone in this
room has experienced


267
0:10:33,511 --> 0:10:36,69
this-- your brain just
changes the goal post of what


268
0:10:36,69 --> 0:10:38,765
success looks like for
you almost immediately.


269
0:10:38,765 --> 0:10:40,14
You've got good
grades in school?


270
0:10:40,14 --> 0:10:41,62
Don't get excited
yet, because now you


271
0:10:41,62 --> 0:10:42,953
need to get into better schools.


272
0:10:42,953 --> 0:10:44,19
You got into a better school?


273
0:10:44,19 --> 0:10:46,49
Don't get excited there, because
then you have to get a job.


274
0:10:46,49 --> 0:10:47,51
You don't even have
a job yet, right?


275
0:10:47,51 --> 0:10:49,6
So you have to get that
internship and job.


276
0:10:49,6 --> 0:10:50,143
You hit your sales target?


277
0:10:50,143 --> 0:10:51,6
We raise your sales target.


278
0:10:51,6 --> 0:10:53,38
You had double growth
earnings last year?


279
0:10:53,38 --> 0:10:54,14
That's phenomenal.


280
0:10:54,14 --> 0:10:56,12
That means we can double
the growth again this year.


281
0:10:56,12 --> 0:10:57,244
And that's not the problem.


282
0:10:57,244 --> 0:10:59,17
We want to see what your
brain is capable of.


283
0:10:59,17 --> 0:11:0,65
We want growth to improve.


284
0:11:0,65 --> 0:11:2,25
We want to see
sales improve, all


285
0:11:2,25 --> 0:11:3,483
of these different
types of things.


286
0:11:3,483 --> 0:11:5,92
The problem is where happiness
comes in that formula.


287
0:11:5,92 --> 0:11:8,8
Because if happiness
comes after success,


288
0:11:8,8 --> 0:11:9,71
which is a moving
target, the brain


289
0:11:9,71 --> 0:11:12,59
never gets there for very long.


290
0:11:12,59 --> 0:11:14,85
We can raise your success
rates your entire life.


291
0:11:14,85 --> 0:11:15,967
We can raise your income.


292
0:11:15,967 --> 0:11:17,5
We don't actually do this.


293
0:11:17,5 --> 0:11:19,19
We watch people whose
success rates rise.


294
0:11:19,19 --> 0:11:21,8
That'd be very
hard for us to do.


295
0:11:21,8 --> 0:11:23,33
We watch people whose success
rates rise dramatically,


296
0:11:23,33 --> 0:11:26,25
and their happiness
levels flatline.


297
0:11:26,25 --> 0:11:27,49
They actually don't move.


298
0:11:27,49 --> 0:11:29,775
So as your success
rises in your life,


299
0:11:29,775 --> 0:11:32,232
your happiness levels will
actually remain about the same.


300
0:11:32,232 --> 0:11:33,69
But flip around
the formula, if you


301
0:11:33,69 --> 0:11:36,68
can get people to deepen the
social connection they feel,


302
0:11:36,68 --> 0:11:38,93
the meaning embedded in the
relationships, the breadth


303
0:11:38,93 --> 0:11:41,48
and depth of the relationships,
if you change and raise


304
0:11:41,48 --> 0:11:43,855
their levels of optimism, if
you get people to see stress


305
0:11:43,855 --> 0:11:45,88
as a challenge instead
of as a threat,


306
0:11:45,88 --> 0:11:47,71
when our brain is
positive first,


307
0:11:47,71 --> 0:11:50,87
every single educational
outcome and business outcome


308
0:11:50,87 --> 0:11:53,58
we can test for
rises dramatically,


309
0:11:53,58 --> 0:11:54,85
and our success rates rise.


310
0:11:54,85 --> 0:11:57,2
So raised success rates,
happiness flatlines.


311
0:11:57,2 --> 0:11:59,79
But raise levels of happiness
withinside organizations


312
0:11:59,79 --> 0:12:1,36
and schools, and
their success rates


313
0:12:1,36 --> 0:12:6,6
rise dramatically,
which is phenomenal.


314
0:12:6,6 --> 0:12:10,134
I spent 12 years at Harvard,
first as an undergraduate


315
0:12:10,134 --> 0:12:11,55
and then I was at
Divinity School,


316
0:12:11,55 --> 0:12:13,33
and then I was a
teaching fellow there.


317
0:12:13,33 --> 0:12:19,29
And when I first got into
Harvard, I applied on a dare,


318
0:12:19,29 --> 0:12:21,22
so I didn't expect to get in.


319
0:12:21,22 --> 0:12:22,79
We didn't have any
money for college,


320
0:12:22,79 --> 0:12:25,64
but I got a Navy
ROTC scholarship,


321
0:12:25,64 --> 0:12:28,79
which allowed me to
go there through MIT.


322
0:12:28,79 --> 0:12:31,63
And so I found myself in
classrooms full of people


323
0:12:31,63 --> 0:12:35,49
who were incredibly smart
and were just amazing.


324
0:12:35,49 --> 0:12:37,79
And I remember that I could
have felt bad about myself,


325
0:12:37,79 --> 0:12:40,55
like the mistake, but I remember
just sitting there thinking


326
0:12:40,55 --> 0:12:42,52
this is amazing to get
to have the opportunity


327
0:12:42,52 --> 0:12:45,19
like this morning,
to get to spend time


328
0:12:45,19 --> 0:12:48,37
with all these incredibly
brilliant and motivated people.


329
0:12:48,37 --> 0:12:51,27
And you can look around,
and for many of you--


330
0:12:51,27 --> 0:12:55,43
I know some of you are
from Harvard, actually--


331
0:12:55,43 --> 0:12:57,0
and you could see
the students who


332
0:12:57,0 --> 0:12:59,63
saw their education
as a privilege.


333
0:12:59,63 --> 0:13:1,63
They saw what they were
doing as an opportunity,


334
0:13:1,63 --> 0:13:3,838
and they invested in it in
completely different ways.


335
0:13:3,838 --> 0:13:5,97
They'd take classes that
they'd get a bad grade in,


336
0:13:5,97 --> 0:13:8,949
like an A-minus, just
because they wanted to learn.


337
0:13:8,949 --> 0:13:10,49
Or they'd get involved
with a sport--


338
0:13:10,49 --> 0:13:12,435
CHADE-MENG TAN:
Obviously not Asian.


339
0:13:12,435 --> 0:13:13,49
That's like an Asian C.


340
0:13:13,49 --> 0:13:14,365
SHAWN ACHOR: Exactly.


341
0:13:14,365 --> 0:13:15,98
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


342
0:13:15,98 --> 0:13:18,454
SHAWN ACHOR: I like that.


343
0:13:18,454 --> 0:13:20,69
CHADE-MENG TAN:
I'm just kidding.


344
0:13:20,69 --> 0:13:23,184
Almost.


345
0:13:23,184 --> 0:13:24,6
SHAWN ACHOR: We'd
have people that


346
0:13:24,6 --> 0:13:27,881
would ride the bench on
a sport for three years


347
0:13:27,881 --> 0:13:29,63
just so they could
make friends, and those


348
0:13:29,63 --> 0:13:31,0
are the people who
loved their time there.


349
0:13:31,0 --> 0:13:32,1
And actually, in
one of our studies


350
0:13:32,1 --> 0:13:33,67
we found that those
are the people who


351
0:13:33,67 --> 0:13:35,2
give the most in
alumni donations


352
0:13:35,2 --> 0:13:37,15
back to the school
later on, which


353
0:13:37,15 --> 0:13:40,12
is why Harvard got interested
in happiness in the first place.


354
0:13:40,12 --> 0:13:42,5
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


355
0:13:42,5 --> 0:13:45,53
SHAWN ACHOR: But afterwards,
I got the opportunity


356
0:13:45,53 --> 0:13:46,39
to stay at Harvard.


357
0:13:46,39 --> 0:13:49,9
I knew that if I left they
wouldn't let me back in.


358
0:13:49,9 --> 0:13:51,24
And so I stayed there
for the next eight years,


359
0:13:51,24 --> 0:13:53,59
and I lived in the dorms with
the freshman as a Proctor


360
0:13:53,59 --> 0:13:54,73
there.


361
0:13:54,73 --> 0:14:0,49
And Harvard invited me to do
that-- I wasn't that guy who


362
0:14:0,49 --> 0:14:2,85
stays in the freshman dorms
meeting people-- for most


363
0:14:2,85 --> 0:14:3,3
of it.


364
0:14:3,3 --> 0:14:5,19
So what it meant was I could
watch these students transition


365
0:14:5,19 --> 0:14:6,522
from high school to college.


366
0:14:6,522 --> 0:14:8,23
And what I saw very
quickly was no matter


367
0:14:8,23 --> 0:14:10,852
how happy they were getting into
that school, two weeks later,


368
0:14:10,852 --> 0:14:12,31
many of them, their
brains were not


369
0:14:12,31 --> 0:14:14,856
focused on the privilege of
being there or even fully


370
0:14:14,856 --> 0:14:16,48
focused on their
philosophy or physics.


371
0:14:16,48 --> 0:14:19,137
Their brains were scattered
thinking about the competition,


372
0:14:19,137 --> 0:14:21,47
the workload, the stresses,
the hassles, and complaints.


373
0:14:21,47 --> 0:14:23,92
And very quickly, what was
promised to create great


374
0:14:23,92 --> 0:14:25,65
happiness wasn't.


375
0:14:25,65 --> 0:14:28,35
80% of Harvard students,
according to the "Crimson" poll


376
0:14:28,35 --> 0:14:30,235
that they had, 80%
of them reported


377
0:14:30,235 --> 0:14:32,61
experiencing depression at
sometime during the four years


378
0:14:32,61 --> 0:14:33,16
there.


379
0:14:33,16 --> 0:14:35,77
And a study that came out in
2003 by the University Health


380
0:14:35,77 --> 0:14:40,0
Services, they measured
6,000 undergraduates


381
0:14:40,0 --> 0:14:43,2
and found that 10% of them
had contemplated suicide


382
0:14:43,2 --> 0:14:44,81
at some point during
their time there,


383
0:14:44,81 --> 0:14:46,93
which is extraordinarily high.


384
0:14:46,93 --> 0:14:48,72
And I know that
these are statistics,


385
0:14:48,72 --> 0:14:50,187
but those are human beings.


386
0:14:50,187 --> 0:14:52,52
And it was heartbreaking
watching some of these students


387
0:14:52,52 --> 0:14:55,7
and some of the
people that we know


388
0:14:55,7 --> 0:14:59,5
lose that connection to meaning
in their life and the potential


389
0:14:59,5 --> 0:15:0,727
that they had.


390
0:15:0,727 --> 0:15:2,56
One of the studies that
I got to do early on


391
0:15:2,56 --> 0:15:4,59
was I looked at 1,600
Harvard students


392
0:15:4,59 --> 0:15:7,88
to find out who
rises to the top.


393
0:15:7,88 --> 0:15:10,1
If you have people that
are extremely intelligent,


394
0:15:10,1 --> 0:15:12,24
extremely successful,
ambitious, who


395
0:15:12,24 --> 0:15:14,615
rises to the top in terms of
their happiness and success?


396
0:15:14,615 --> 0:15:15,739
And I looked at everything.


397
0:15:15,739 --> 0:15:17,89
I looked at what grades
they got in school.


398
0:15:17,89 --> 0:15:20,14
I looked at their
familial income.


399
0:15:20,14 --> 0:15:22,59
We looked at the SAT scores
before getting into school.


400
0:15:22,59 --> 0:15:24,89
We looked at the number
of friends on Facebook.


401
0:15:24,89 --> 0:15:26,84
We looked at the number
of romantic partners


402
0:15:26,84 --> 0:15:27,59
that they had had.


403
0:15:27,59 --> 0:15:29,18
Which by the way,
at Harvard they've


404
0:15:29,18 --> 0:15:31,32
dated less than one
person, on average,


405
0:15:31,32 --> 0:15:33,35
after their entire
four years of college.

409
0:15:35,271 --> 0:15:35,79
Possibly.


410
0:15:35,79 --> 0:15:39,23
It was lower than any
school we saw so far.


411
0:15:39,23 --> 0:15:42,395
It was actually 0.5 sexual
partners per Harvard student.


412
0:15:42,395 --> 0:15:43,77

Yep, engineering.

mention because I don't even

0:15:47,561 --> 0:15:49,55
know what that
statistic means, 0.5.


417
0:15:49,55 --> 0:15:51,15
We were always
taught to round up.

CHADE-MENG TAN: Better than MIT.

0:15:52,84 --> 0:15:54,89
SHAWN ACHOR: Possibly.


420
0:15:54,89 --> 0:15:55,39
Probably.

0.5 sexual partners,


423
0:15:58,92 --> 0:16:1,79
it's the scientific
equivalent of second base,

0:16:1,79 --> 0:16:2,62
and it was useless

was imagine a student who


427
0:16:9,0 --> 0:16:10,647
ever since they
were one-year-old

0:16:10,647 --> 0:16:12,98
was placed into a crib wearing
a onesie that you can buy


429
0:16:12,98 --> 0:16:16,41
at the bookstore, at The Coop,
that says "Bound for Harvard"


430
0:16:16,41 --> 0:16:19,781
and maybe a cute little Yale
hat, in case something terrible


431
0:16:19,781 --> 0:16:20,28
happened.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


433
0:16:23,45 --> 0:16:24,42
SHAWN ACHOR: And
ever since there


434
0:16:24,42 --> 0:16:27,259
were in special pre-K school
that they got into four years


435
0:16:27,259 --> 0:16:28,8
before they were
conceived, they were


436
0:16:28,8 --> 0:16:30,39
at the top 1% of their class.


437
0:16:30,39 --> 0:16:32,96
Junior high, high school,
standardized tests, top 1%.


438
0:16:32,96 --> 0:16:35,46
They get into Harvard, and they
have a terrible realization.


439
0:16:35,46 --> 0:16:37,615
50% of them are
now below average.


440
0:16:37,615 --> 0:16:39,24
And to put it more
poignantly, when


441
0:16:39,24 --> 0:16:41,28
I was counseling students
I would tell them


442
0:16:41,28 --> 0:16:44,43
it seems as if 99%
of Harvard students


443
0:16:44,43 --> 0:16:47,336
do not graduate in
the top 1%, which


444
0:16:47,336 --> 0:16:48,6
they don't find funny at all.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


446
0:16:49,77 --> 0:16:51,8
SHAWN ACHOR: But the
reason that's interesting


447
0:16:51,8 --> 0:16:52,454
is they decide
the only way I can


448
0:16:52,454 --> 0:16:56,53
be happy is if I'm in the
top 1% of one category of one

0:16:57,81 --> 0:16:58,394
Not worldwide.


451
0:16:58,394 --> 0:16:59,851
And they pick
grades-- which if you


452
0:16:59,851 --> 0:17:2,34
know the research on grades,
you can roll a pair of dice,


453
0:17:2,34 --> 0:17:5,4
and that's as predictive
of your future job success


454
0:17:5,4 --> 0:17:7,709
as your college GPA
is, which is why


455
0:17:7,709 --> 0:17:9,72
a lot of people who make
straight A's in college


456
0:17:9,72 --> 0:17:13,996
work for people who got
straight C's in business school.

0:17:15,79 --> 0:17:16,787
But part of what I
think is fascinating--

0:17:16,787 --> 0:17:17,71
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


460
0:17:17,71 --> 0:17:19,96
SHAWN ACHOR: What I think
is so fascinating about this


461
0:17:19,96 --> 0:17:22,349
is that we've got the
formula backwards.


462
0:17:22,349 --> 0:17:25,39
They thought, well, if I
got into a good school,


463
0:17:25,39 --> 0:17:28,64
if I got a great job, if I
got to where I am in life,


464
0:17:28,64 --> 0:17:30,12
of course I'd be happier.


465
0:17:30,12 --> 0:17:32,11
And it turns out that
it doesn't automatically


466
0:17:32,11 --> 0:17:33,6
cause greater
levels of happiness.


467
0:17:33,6 --> 0:17:36,711
But amazingly, the formula could
actually work in the other way.


468
0:17:36,711 --> 0:17:39,21
We found something that we now
call the happiness advantage,


469
0:17:39,21 --> 0:17:41,207
which is when the brain
is positive it has


470
0:17:41,207 --> 0:17:43,54
an unfair advantage over the
brain at negative, neutral,


471
0:17:43,54 --> 0:17:44,38
or stressed.


472
0:17:44,38 --> 0:17:45,93
You're 31% more productive.


473
0:17:45,93 --> 0:17:48,38
Sales rise from a
neutral salesperson


474
0:17:48,38 --> 0:17:51,87
to the same salesperson
at optimistic by 37%.


475
0:17:51,87 --> 0:17:54,63
We found that people who
provide social support work,


476
0:17:54,63 --> 0:17:57,0
you're 40% more likely
to receive a promotion


477
0:17:57,0 --> 0:17:58,83
over the next two-year
period of time.


478
0:17:58,83 --> 0:18:1,33
We find that you live longer.


479
0:18:1,33 --> 0:18:2,62
We just did a study, actually.


480
0:18:2,62 --> 0:18:4,221
I love this study.


481
0:18:4,221 --> 0:18:5,72
I got to work with
one of my friends


482
0:18:5,72 --> 0:18:9,36
who w one of my students
at Harvard, Alia Crum.


483
0:18:9,36 --> 0:18:12,75
And she went off to Yale.


484
0:18:12,75 --> 0:18:15,48
We did a joint study
at UBS in the middle


485
0:18:15,48 --> 0:18:17,742
of the banking crisis,
the big Swiss bank.


486
0:18:17,742 --> 0:18:19,45
And one of the things
we were looking for


487
0:18:19,45 --> 0:18:21,87
is that oftentimes
the companies would


488
0:18:21,87 --> 0:18:24,67
want to push you very hard, and
then your stress levels rise,


489
0:18:24,67 --> 0:18:27,516
and then they give you a
stress management program.


490
0:18:27,516 --> 0:18:28,89
And the stress
management program


491
0:18:28,89 --> 0:18:30,52
goes something like this.


492
0:18:30,52 --> 0:18:32,98
Did you know that stress is
related to the 10 leading


493
0:18:32,98 --> 0:18:35,442
causes of death and disease
in the United States?


494
0:18:35,442 --> 0:18:37,4
Did you know that the
World Health Organization


495
0:18:37,4 --> 0:18:39,8
found stress to be
the number one killer?


496
0:18:39,8 --> 0:18:42,9
Stress is related to 80% to 90%
of all doctor-related visits.


497
0:18:42,9 --> 0:18:44,9
And stress is catabolic.


498
0:18:44,9 --> 0:18:47,672
It literally tears down every
organ in the human body.


499
0:18:47,672 --> 0:18:49,63
As soon as you hear that,
what do you think it?


500
0:18:49,63 --> 0:18:50,709
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


501
0:18:50,709 --> 0:18:51,75
SHAWN ACHOR: More stress.

0:18:51,75 --> 0:18:53,91
You're like, stop
emailing me so much work.


503
0:18:53,91 --> 0:18:56,82
You're destroying every
organ in my body, which


504
0:18:56,82 --> 0:18:59,8
I think would make a great
away message at work.


505
0:18:59,8 --> 0:19:2,64
But part of what we found
is that all of that's true.


506
0:19:2,64 --> 0:19:4,77
All of that information
is absolutely true.


507
0:19:4,77 --> 0:19:6,72
Stress is terrible killer.


508
0:19:6,72 --> 0:19:10,357
But just like with Vitamin
C and coffee and alcohol,


509
0:19:10,357 --> 0:19:11,94
we keep finding
studies that are like,


510
0:19:11,94 --> 0:19:14,53
alcohol will save your
life, and it will kill you.


511
0:19:14,53 --> 0:19:16,44
Vitamin C causes cancer
and cures cancer.


512
0:19:16,44 --> 0:19:17,51
And we get so frustrated.


513
0:19:17,51 --> 0:19:18,8
We're like, well, what
am I supposed to do?


514
0:19:18,8 --> 0:19:20,341
Am I supposed to
drink coffee or not?


515
0:19:20,341 --> 0:19:22,64
Am I supposed to
drink red wine or not?


516
0:19:22,64 --> 0:19:25,377
The reason is that it's less
about the external world


517
0:19:25,377 --> 0:19:26,96
but about how your
body and your brain


518
0:19:26,96 --> 0:19:30,4
process what comes into your
system and what you experience.


519
0:19:30,4 --> 0:19:31,57
The same thing's
true with stress.


520
0:19:31,57 --> 0:19:33,545
So there's an equally
true information


521
0:19:33,545 --> 0:19:36,99
that says that stress actually
releases a growth hormone that


522
0:19:36,99 --> 0:19:38,76
speeds up the
recovery of your cells


523
0:19:38,76 --> 0:19:40,38
faster than anything we've seen.


524
0:19:40,38 --> 0:19:42,65
Not low levels of stress
but moderate to high


525
0:19:42,65 --> 0:19:45,4
levels of stress actually
turn on your immune system


526
0:19:45,4 --> 0:19:46,64
to the highest possible level.


527
0:19:46,64 --> 0:19:49,52
We found that stress deepens
your social bonds more


528
0:19:49,52 --> 0:19:52,1
than anything, which is
why last week I was out


529
0:19:52,1 --> 0:19:54,69
working at the Pentagon, and one
of the things they were saying


530
0:19:54,69 --> 0:19:57,27
is that's why we on-board
people in the military


531
0:19:57,27 --> 0:19:59,87
with bootcamp and
not a beach vacation,


532
0:19:59,87 --> 0:20:2,9
because we know that that
stressful period doesn't


533
0:20:2,9 --> 0:20:2,992
tear people down.


534
0:20:2,992 --> 0:20:4,95
It actually causes them
to create these meaning


535
0:20:4,95 --> 0:20:7,158
structures, these narratives,
and these relationships


536
0:20:7,158 --> 0:20:9,64
that they talk about for the
entire rest of their life.


537
0:20:9,64 --> 0:20:11,58
In fact, every moment
of high human potential


538
0:20:11,58 --> 0:20:14,26
occurs in the midst of
stress, not the absence of it.


539
0:20:14,26 --> 0:20:16,17
So what we did is we
just showed them videos


540
0:20:16,17 --> 0:20:18,15
and created a small
training for the UBS


541
0:20:18,15 --> 0:20:20,52
employees in the middle
of a banking crisis


542
0:20:20,52 --> 0:20:23,3
when they went through
four restructurings


543
0:20:23,3 --> 0:20:26,33
and they were told that
they didn't get their bonus.


544
0:20:26,33 --> 0:20:28,3
One of my very first
talks was actually


545
0:20:28,3 --> 0:20:30,14
at a Swiss bank out in Zurich.


546
0:20:30,14 --> 0:20:33,167
And the introduction
was, we don't


547
0:20:33,167 --> 0:20:35,0
have bonuses for everyone,
but here's a talk


548
0:20:35,0 --> 0:20:36,541
on happiness from
a guy from America.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


550
0:20:38,36 --> 0:20:40,137
CHADE-MENG TAN: Yay.


551
0:20:40,137 --> 0:20:41,12
SHAWN ACHOR: Exactly.


552
0:20:41,12 --> 0:20:44,861



553
0:20:44,861 --> 0:20:46,61
Which is amazing,
because they immediately


554
0:20:46,61 --> 0:20:48,19
stonewalled the information.


555
0:20:48,19 --> 0:20:49,56
But 10 minutes later,
as soon as they


556
0:20:49,56 --> 0:20:51,67
started hearing that
there's research about this,


557
0:20:51,67 --> 0:20:53,0
suddenly things
started to change.


558
0:20:53,0 --> 0:20:54,37
Because it wasn't
about just, oh, let's


559
0:20:54,37 --> 0:20:55,65
be happier in the midst
of this challenge.


560
0:20:55,65 --> 0:20:58,46
It was like, here's how we can
actually change the way that we


561
0:20:58,46 --> 0:21:0,54
view this world and
actually ripple this out


562
0:21:0,54 --> 0:21:2,647
to other people around us.


563
0:21:2,647 --> 0:21:3,48
I'm going off track.


564
0:21:3,48 --> 0:21:4,6
We can come back to that.


565
0:21:4,6 --> 0:21:7,266
But the part of what I found was
so interesting about the stress


566
0:21:7,266 --> 0:21:9,58
study was we had two groups.


567
0:21:9,58 --> 0:21:11,24
One group saw stress
as debilitating,


568
0:21:11,24 --> 0:21:12,875
and one group saw
stress as enhancing.


569
0:21:12,875 --> 0:21:15,52
And we tracked them
for the next six weeks.


570
0:21:15,52 --> 0:21:19,89
And I was hoping that the group
that saw stress as enhancing


571
0:21:19,89 --> 0:21:20,88
would actually have
lower levels of stress.


572
0:21:20,88 --> 0:21:22,68
That was my hope,
and we were wrong.


573
0:21:22,68 --> 0:21:26,13
Turns out they had equal levels
of stress and extremely high.


574
0:21:26,13 --> 0:21:29,77
But their health-related
symptoms, their back aches,


575
0:21:29,77 --> 0:21:32,81
headaches, and fatigue,
their energy levels at work


576
0:21:32,81 --> 0:21:36,21
improved by 23% for the group
that saw stress as enhancing,


577
0:21:36,21 --> 0:21:38,61
a nearly 30% increase
in their productivity,


578
0:21:38,61 --> 0:21:40,24
and their levels of
happiness improved.


579
0:21:40,24 --> 0:21:43,25
What that means is stress
is inevitable in our lives,


580
0:21:43,25 --> 0:21:46,13
but the way that we
perceive stress changes how


581
0:21:46,13 --> 0:21:47,6
it affects the human body.


582
0:21:47,6 --> 0:21:50,97
And the reason why we feel such
a negative effect from stress


583
0:21:50,97 --> 0:21:53,24
is because stress should
be meaningful, right?


584
0:21:53,24 --> 0:21:55,719
If I tell you your inbox is
full of spam, you're like, OK,


585
0:21:55,719 --> 0:21:56,26
I don't care.


586
0:21:56,26 --> 0:21:57,781
But if your inbox
is full of things


587
0:21:57,781 --> 0:21:59,78
you need to get back that
you wanted to get back


588
0:21:59,78 --> 0:22:1,85
to that are meaningful for
your job or connections


589
0:22:1,85 --> 0:22:3,724
you want to make, suddenly
you care about it.


590
0:22:3,724 --> 0:22:7,407
Or if I tell somebody that
somebody's kid is failing


591
0:22:7,407 --> 0:22:8,74
English, they don't really care.


592
0:22:8,74 --> 0:22:11,9
If their kid's failing English,
they care a whole bunch.


593
0:22:11,9 --> 0:22:12,42
Stress has meaning in it.


594
0:22:12,42 --> 0:22:15,859
But when we separate the energy
from stress from meaning,


595
0:22:15,859 --> 0:22:17,9
that's when we get these
negative health effects.


596
0:22:17,9 --> 0:22:19,79
So what we found is we can
actually train people out


597
0:22:19,79 --> 0:22:21,54
of these ideas,
which is incredible.


598
0:22:21,54 --> 0:22:25,21
So all we have to do is deepen
somebody's social connection,


599
0:22:25,21 --> 0:22:28,339
change their optimism, or change
the way that they view stress,


600
0:22:28,339 --> 0:22:30,38
and we can actually improve
every single business


601
0:22:30,38 --> 0:22:33,79
and educational outcome
worldwide, which is incredible.


602
0:22:33,79 --> 0:22:35,94
CHADE-MENG TAN: Lovely.


603
0:22:35,94 --> 0:22:38,424
Your first book, that really
spoke to me on one level.


604
0:22:38,424 --> 0:22:40,59
Because when you talk about
the happiness advantage,


605
0:22:40,59 --> 0:22:45,22
like happiness before
success, I reflect on my life.


606
0:22:45,22 --> 0:22:47,38
And for me, I'm a meditator.


607
0:22:47,38 --> 0:22:49,12
I've been doing it 20 years.


608
0:22:49,12 --> 0:22:52,89
And if your meditation
practice is deep enough,


609
0:22:52,89 --> 0:22:55,1
you get into a
state where you are


610
0:22:55,1 --> 0:23:0,87
happy independent of
sensations and thoughts.


611
0:23:0,87 --> 0:23:2,59
You are just happy.


612
0:23:2,59 --> 0:23:5,55
And then everything you
experience is bonus.


613
0:23:5,55 --> 0:23:7,75
And then I found that
when I'm consistently


614
0:23:7,75 --> 0:23:11,65
in that from of mind I
became even more successful.


615
0:23:11,65 --> 0:23:16,4
And what you gave me was the
vocabulary and the research


616
0:23:16,4 --> 0:23:18,2
to understand this
whole experience.


617
0:23:18,2 --> 0:23:20,665
So I'm really grateful
to you for that.


618
0:23:20,665 --> 0:23:23,8



619
0:23:23,8 --> 0:23:27,27
So for me, I decided to
dedicate my life to creating


620
0:23:27,27 --> 0:23:31,52
the conditions for world
peace by making peace, joy,


621
0:23:31,52 --> 0:23:33,81
and compassion
universally accessible.


622
0:23:33,81 --> 0:23:37,2
And I know that's what
you want to do as well.


623
0:23:37,2 --> 0:23:40,85
And so my question next to
you is, how do you spread it?


624
0:23:40,85 --> 0:23:42,25
How do spread happiness?


625
0:23:42,25 --> 0:23:43,506
You and maybe in general.


626
0:23:43,506 --> 0:23:45,13
How do you spread
happiness in general?


627
0:23:45,13 --> 0:23:47,356



628
0:23:47,356 --> 0:23:48,73
SHAWN ACHOR: Well,
we're actually


629
0:23:48,73 --> 0:23:51,49
helped out by our brains.


630
0:23:51,49 --> 0:23:53,91
One of the things that I've
found so incredible in some


631
0:23:53,91 --> 0:23:59,25
of this research that's coming
out is one of the experiments


632
0:23:59,25 --> 0:24:2,9
that I have people do
in some of my talks--


633
0:24:2,9 --> 0:24:5,719
which actually we can do
it right now, if you want.


634
0:24:5,719 --> 0:24:6,76
Let's do it real quickly.


635
0:24:6,76 --> 0:24:8,926
So you don't have to do any
of my experiments today.


636
0:24:8,926 --> 0:24:11,94
I'm not allowed to bring
consent forms to talks,


637
0:24:11,94 --> 0:24:15,54
because we had an electric shock
problem a couple years ago.


638
0:24:15,54 --> 0:24:17,29
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


639
0:24:17,29 --> 0:24:18,11
SHAWN ACHOR: But here's
what I need you to do.


640
0:24:18,11 --> 0:24:19,8
And you can do
this even if you're


641
0:24:19,8 --> 0:24:20,785
watching from a remote location.


642
0:24:20,785 --> 0:24:23,6
All I need you to do is
just partner up with someone


643
0:24:23,6 --> 0:24:24,185
that's sitting next to you.


644
0:24:24,185 --> 0:24:26,132
Partner up into pairs of two.


645
0:24:26,132 --> 0:24:27,9
Of course pairs of two.


646
0:24:27,9 --> 0:24:28,14
Partner up into pairs.


647
0:24:28,14 --> 0:24:31,119
The only caveat is legally I'm
required to tell you you cannot


648
0:24:31,119 --> 0:24:33,41
partner up with someone that
you're married to for this


649
0:24:33,41 --> 0:24:35,86
experiment or that you
want to be married to.


650
0:24:35,86 --> 0:24:38,469
So move around if you're
struggling with this.


651
0:24:38,469 --> 0:24:40,1
CHADE-MENG TAN: You
know who you are.


652
0:24:40,1 --> 0:24:41,93
SHAWN ACHOR: Yes, exactly.


653
0:24:41,93 --> 0:24:42,84
So does everyone have a partner?


654
0:24:42,84 --> 0:24:45,36
You can move closer, because
you need to sit next to them.


655
0:24:45,36 --> 0:24:52,61



656
0:24:52,61 --> 0:24:54,37
So here's what I need you to do.


657
0:24:54,37 --> 0:24:56,5
The person that's sitting
closest to this wall,


658
0:24:56,5 --> 0:24:58,79
to the exits is your person
number one in the pair.


659
0:24:58,79 --> 0:24:59,82
The person furthest
from that wall,


660
0:24:59,82 --> 0:25:1,361
you're person number
two in the pair.


661
0:25:1,361 --> 0:25:4,981
If you're remote, just pick
one person to be number one.


662
0:25:4,981 --> 0:25:6,48
Some of you are
like, I already knew


663
0:25:6,48 --> 0:25:8,36
I was person number
one in this pair.


664
0:25:8,36 --> 0:25:10,83
There should be a two
and a one in each group.


665
0:25:10,83 --> 0:25:13,475
So raise your hand if
you're person number one.


666
0:25:13,475 --> 0:25:15,33
Raise your hand if
you're person number two.


667
0:25:15,33 --> 0:25:15,83
OK.


668
0:25:15,83 --> 0:25:16,93
That's not the experiment.


669
0:25:16,93 --> 0:25:17,809
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


670
0:25:17,809 --> 0:25:19,1
SHAWN ACHOR: I have to do that.


671
0:25:19,1 --> 0:25:21,11
Because I did this experiment
on Wall Street a couple months


672
0:25:21,11 --> 0:25:23,55
ago, and it literally took that
struggling bank five minutes


673
0:25:23,55 --> 0:25:25,466
to figure out who number
one in the group was.


674
0:25:25,466 --> 0:25:26,507
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


675
0:25:26,507 --> 0:25:28,59
SHAWN ACHOR: Which explains
what's going on there.


676
0:25:28,59 --> 0:25:30,464
So here's what I need you to do.


677
0:25:30,464 --> 0:25:32,88
How many of you, by the way,
have a psychology background,


678
0:25:32,88 --> 0:25:35,37
read a lot of psychology
books, studied psychology?


679
0:25:35,37 --> 0:25:35,87
OK.


680
0:25:35,87 --> 0:25:37,71
So for my psychology
friends, this


681
0:25:37,71 --> 0:25:40,167
is the emotional prime
of the experiment.


682
0:25:40,167 --> 0:25:41,625
For everyone else,
this is nothing.


683
0:25:41,625 --> 0:25:42,79
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


684
0:25:42,79 --> 0:25:44,23
SHAWN ACHOR: But here's
what we ask you to do.


685
0:25:44,23 --> 0:25:45,29
Over the course of
your life, you've


686
0:25:45,29 --> 0:25:47,249
taken your genes, your
genetic predispositions,


687
0:25:47,249 --> 0:25:49,79
you've beat both those genes
out through your self-discipline


688
0:25:49,79 --> 0:25:50,92
and your self-control.


689
0:25:50,92 --> 0:25:52,58
You were able to pass the
classes that you needed to


690
0:25:52,58 --> 0:25:54,13
in school to get
into the schools


691
0:25:54,13 --> 0:25:56,62
you wanted to to apply yourself
to your job here at Google.


692
0:25:56,62 --> 0:25:58,466
What I'd love for
you to do is to use


693
0:25:58,466 --> 0:26:0,9
all of that
self-discipline and control


694
0:26:0,9 --> 0:26:1,85
that you've been
cultivating for decades,


695
0:26:1,85 --> 0:26:4,35
and I'd like you to use it to
control your behavior for just


696
0:26:4,35 --> 0:26:6,329
seven seconds of this
experiment, if you can.


697
0:26:6,329 --> 0:26:7,87
At eight seconds,
you can do whatever


698
0:26:7,87 --> 0:26:9,662
you want to or
with your partner.


699
0:26:9,662 --> 0:26:11,12
But for seven
seconds, you're mine.


700
0:26:11,12 --> 0:26:15,33
So what we ask you do in this
experiment, person number one,


701
0:26:15,33 --> 0:26:17,254
is to not get angry
with person number


702
0:26:17,254 --> 0:26:19,17
two when they do to you
what I'm about to tell


703
0:26:19,17 --> 0:26:19,92
them to do to you.

are going to do nothing
with person number two.

go neutral on the inside.

Try to feel no emotions,
and try and think

0:26:52,15 --> 0:26:53,566
no thoughts, which
for some of you


723
0:26:53,566 --> 0:26:55,8
might be extremely
easy right now.

No fear, no flinching, no
frustration, zero emotion.

of self-discipline

for person number to
control themselves.

neutral on the inside.

and control

successful than person number

control yourself.

765
0:28:16,64 --> 0:28:26,58



766
0:28:26,58 --> 0:28:27,27
And stop.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


769
0:28:31,959 --> 0:28:34,0
SHAWN ACHOR: So what I
love about this experiment


770
0:28:34,0 --> 0:28:35,55
is even if you're
successful at it,


771
0:28:35,55 --> 0:28:37,94
as soon as you say stop
people relax as if that was


772
0:28:37,94 --> 0:28:41,68
the hardest thing they had to
do all day, which literally was


773
0:28:41,68 --> 0:28:43,86
doing nothing for
the seven seconds.


774
0:28:43,86 --> 0:28:45,86
But first of all, I'm
just curious in this room,


775
0:28:45,86 --> 0:28:48,6
it's a quiet room, so it's hard.


776
0:28:48,6 --> 0:28:49,38
This experiment
works much better


777
0:28:49,38 --> 0:28:51,7
if you've got more
priming going on.


778
0:28:51,7 --> 0:28:53,83
But I'm just curious,
failure at this experiment


779
0:28:53,83 --> 0:28:55,74
means you smiled when
I asked you not to,


780
0:28:55,74 --> 0:28:57,22
and success means that
you did not smile.


781
0:28:57,22 --> 0:28:59,678
Raise your hand if you failed
miserably at this by smiling.


782
0:28:59,678 --> 0:29:0,81
Oh, OK.


783
0:29:0,81 --> 0:29:1,86
So a lot of you.


784
0:29:1,86 --> 0:29:3,652
That's terrible.


785
0:29:3,652 --> 0:29:5,11
Raise your hand if
you successfully


786
0:29:5,11 --> 0:29:8,47
did what I asked you to
for the full seven seconds.


787
0:29:8,47 --> 0:29:14,87
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,


788

0:29:19,7 --> 0:29:21,9
SHAWN ACHOR: What we find is--


792
0:29:21,9 --> 0:29:22,34

793
0:29:22,34 --> 0:29:23,822
SHAWN ACHOR: Exactly.


794
0:29:23,822 --> 0:29:25,53
Actually, I don't know
why I counted you,


795
0:29:25,53 --> 0:29:27,738
because I don't know how
many people are in the room.


796
0:29:27,738 --> 0:29:30,451
But what we find is 80% to
85% of people worldwide cannot


797
0:29:30,451 --> 0:29:32,95
control themselves for the seven
seconds of this experiment.


798
0:29:32,95 --> 0:29:34,95
I did this with senior-level
bankers, all men,


799
0:29:34,95 --> 0:29:37,52
all in their mid-50s
in Tokyo, Japan,


800
0:29:37,52 --> 0:29:39,55
and the smile
percentage was 77%.


801
0:29:39,55 --> 0:29:43,84
What we're finding is
it's extremely universal.


802
0:29:43,84 --> 0:29:48,2
You mentioned I've been
to over 50 countries,


803
0:29:48,2 --> 0:29:50,38
and I've done this
experiment in all of them.


804
0:29:50,38 --> 0:29:51,82
But one I made a mistake with.


805
0:29:51,82 --> 0:29:53,87
And this gets directly
back your question.


806
0:29:53,87 --> 0:29:56,82
But I wanted to
tell you about this.


807
0:29:56,82 --> 0:30:2,39
So last year I got invited by
the royal family in Abu Dhabi,


808
0:30:2,39 --> 0:30:4,8
as one does, to get to
give a talk on happiness.


809
0:30:4,8 --> 0:30:7,84
And I was so excited
about this opportunity


810
0:30:7,84 --> 0:30:10,349
that I went over there and was
meeting all of these people


811
0:30:10,349 --> 0:30:12,64
that I'd never met before
and been to a place I'd never


812
0:30:12,64 --> 0:30:14,977
had that I wasn't thinking
when I got into the talk,


813
0:30:14,977 --> 0:30:16,6
because I was too excited.


814
0:30:16,6 --> 0:30:18,78
And one of the talks there was
for 300 women in the Middle


815
0:30:18,78 --> 0:30:21,15
East about how we can raise
up levels of happiness


816
0:30:21,15 --> 0:30:22,62
and positive leadership there.


817
0:30:22,62 --> 0:30:23,39
And some of you are
smiling because you


818
0:30:23,39 --> 0:30:24,61
know the mistake I made.


819
0:30:24,61 --> 0:30:28,21
I tried the smiling experiment
in the talk and only


820
0:30:28,21 --> 0:30:30,42
halfway through realized
that 90% of the room


821
0:30:30,42 --> 0:30:32,742
was veiled for the
smiling experiment, which


822
0:30:32,742 --> 0:30:35,2
had I thought it before I would
not have made that mistake.


823
0:30:35,2 --> 0:30:38,41
But I'm so grateful I did,
because the women in the room


824
0:30:38,41 --> 0:30:39,31
taught me something.


825
0:30:39,31 --> 0:30:41,41
They told me that
the experiment still


826
0:30:41,41 --> 0:30:43,95
worked because they could see
the smile in the other woman's


827
0:30:43,95 --> 0:30:44,66
eyes.


828
0:30:44,66 --> 0:30:47,13
And even behind the veil,
the smile was contagious.


829
0:30:47,13 --> 0:30:49,59
The reason why this is so
fascinating is what we found


830
0:30:49,59 --> 0:30:53,989
is inside the human brain, what
we discovered also by accident


831
0:30:53,989 --> 0:30:56,28
is over the past 15 years
we've discovered these things


832
0:30:56,28 --> 0:30:58,3
in the human brain
called mirror neurons.


833
0:30:58,3 --> 0:31:0,58
So if you put me into
a fMRI brain scan,


834
0:31:0,58 --> 0:31:2,889
scan my brain while I'm
smiling, parts of my brain


835
0:31:2,889 --> 0:31:4,93
will show activation
telling me that I'm smiling.


836
0:31:4,93 --> 0:31:6,86
But if I stop
smiling, which is what


837
0:31:6,86 --> 0:31:9,5
you were just trying to do,
and someone smiles at you


838
0:31:9,5 --> 0:31:11,97
or you see a picture
of somebody smiling,


839
0:31:11,97 --> 0:31:13,7
those small parts
of your brain called


840
0:31:13,7 --> 0:31:16,525
mirror neurons will
show activation,


841
0:31:16,525 --> 0:31:18,74
and they'll tell you you're
the one that's smiling.


842
0:31:18,74 --> 0:31:23,97
And your motor neurons
will cause your face


843
0:31:23,97 --> 0:31:26,56
to contort into a smile
before you can stop yourself,


844
0:31:26,56 --> 0:31:29,597
because you already
think you're smiling.


845
0:31:29,597 --> 0:31:31,18
So if you were looking
at your partner


846
0:31:31,18 --> 0:31:32,846
and their lips were
quivering while they


847
0:31:32,846 --> 0:31:35,33
were trying not to
smile, that's weird.


848
0:31:35,33 --> 0:31:36,242
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


849
0:31:36,242 --> 0:31:37,95
SHAWN ACHOR: That
shouldn't be happening.


850
0:31:37,95 --> 0:31:40,372
But what's occurring there
is their mirror neurons


851
0:31:40,372 --> 0:31:42,8
are fighting against
their motor neurons.


852
0:31:42,8 --> 0:31:43,47
Your brain already
thinks you're smiling,


853
0:31:43,47 --> 0:31:44,5
so it's like, what's
the problem here,


854
0:31:44,5 --> 0:31:46,51
face, as your brain
is trying to find out


855
0:31:46,51 --> 0:31:47,77
what's going on between those.


856
0:31:47,77 --> 0:31:48,77
These happen with yawns.


857
0:31:48,77 --> 0:31:51,63
So if you see somebody yawn,
our likelihood of yawning


858
0:31:51,63 --> 0:31:53,13
increases because
our brain actually


859
0:31:53,13 --> 0:31:54,45
tells we're the
one that's yawning.


860
0:31:54,45 --> 0:31:56,17
But why this is so
fascinating and why


861
0:31:56,17 --> 0:31:58,54
this is crucial to
this contagious effect


862
0:31:58,54 --> 0:32:1,49
that we can have is it
turns out that if you


863
0:32:1,49 --> 0:32:5,534
have 15 strangers waiting for
a plane-- they don't even know


864
0:32:5,534 --> 0:32:6,7
they're part experiment yet.


865
0:32:6,7 --> 0:32:8,16
They're just at an
airport-- and you


866
0:32:8,16 --> 0:32:9,63
introduce an
undercover researcher,


867
0:32:9,63 --> 0:32:12,58
a confederate to stand in
the middle of the 15 people


868
0:32:12,58 --> 0:32:15,37
and bounce nervously in place,
tap his foot on the floor


869
0:32:15,37 --> 0:32:18,22
and look at his watch repeatedly
with a frown on his face,


870
0:32:18,22 --> 0:32:20,74
within two minutes of waiting
for that plane or train,


871
0:32:20,74 --> 0:32:24,42
depending on the study, 7 to
12 of the 15 individuals will


872
0:32:24,42 --> 0:32:26,68
unconsciously start
bouncing nervously in place


873
0:32:26,68 --> 0:32:28,487
and/or tapping their
foot on the ground


874
0:32:28,487 --> 0:32:30,57
and/or looking at their
watch more than four times

your brain through these

0:32:58,33 --> 0:33:0,4
And when we tell people
that, they're like, OK.


892
0:33:0,4 --> 0:33:2,5
Well, here are the people
I'm cutting out of my life.

I'm not going to hang
out with this person.

I'm going to de-friend
them on Facebook.

I'm not even going to look
at this person anymore, which


896
0:33:9,34 --> 0:33:10,7
is awkward because
they're in my family.


897
0:33:10,7 --> 0:33:13,7
And what happens is in
each one of those moments


898
0:33:13,7 --> 0:33:14,64
we're eliminating
social connection.


899
0:33:14,64 --> 0:33:16,54
But these mirror neurons
give us the power


900
0:33:16,54 --> 0:33:19,307
to actually spread positive
change even better.


901
0:33:19,307 --> 0:33:20,765
Because as we've
been studying you,


902
0:33:20,765 --> 0:33:22,24
we've been studying you wrong.


903
0:33:22,24 --> 0:33:24,33
There's no wires
connecting your brains.


904
0:33:24,33 --> 0:33:25,589
There's no organic material.


905
0:33:25,589 --> 0:33:27,13
So we've made the
mistake of assuming


906
0:33:27,13 --> 0:33:29,965
that all of your brains were
separate, and they're not.


907
0:33:29,965 --> 0:33:33,2
It misses out on how beautiful
the human organism actually


908
0:33:33,2 --> 0:33:35,82
is, because our brains
are not wired together.


909
0:33:35,82 --> 0:33:38,38
Our brains are
wirelessly connected


910
0:33:38,38 --> 0:33:39,962
through a mirror neuron network.


911
0:33:39,962 --> 0:33:42,17
Your thoughts right now are
changing your nonverbals,


912
0:33:42,17 --> 0:33:44,764
how you're sitting here, which
is changing the way that people


913
0:33:44,764 --> 0:33:46,93
sitting next to you are
processing this information.


914
0:33:46,93 --> 0:33:49,68
We're in a continual
feedback loop with the people


915
0:33:49,68 --> 0:33:51,24
that we walk past
in the cafeteria.


916
0:33:51,24 --> 0:33:53,9
We're in a continual
feedback loop

with our family members
and our friends.


918
0:33:54,839 --> 0:33:56,38
And what we found
is if we can buffer


919
0:33:56,38 --> 0:33:59,42
our brain against the
negative, if we can create even


920
0:33:59,42 --> 0:34:3,27
a single positive change in
our life, meditation, exercise,


921
0:34:3,27 --> 0:34:5,1
gratitude, whatever
it is you're doing,


922
0:34:5,1 --> 0:34:7,5
we can actually watch
that positive effect


923
0:34:7,5 --> 0:34:9,84
that's occurring in your
brain wirelessly impact


924
0:34:9,84 --> 0:34:12,63
the people's brains of
the people around you.


925
0:34:12,63 --> 0:34:14,449
One of the opportunities
I got last year


926
0:34:14,449 --> 0:34:16,692
was to work at a hospital.


927
0:34:16,692 --> 0:34:18,15
And hospitals have
a terrible time,


928
0:34:18,15 --> 0:34:19,733
because when you
think about hospitals


929
0:34:19,733 --> 0:34:21,639
you think about sickness
and disease, Right?


930
0:34:21,639 --> 0:34:22,722
And you can't change that.


931
0:34:22,722 --> 0:34:24,234
But we went into
the Ritz Carlton


932
0:34:24,234 --> 0:34:25,65
to figure out what
they were doing


933
0:34:25,65 --> 0:34:27,273
to get people to
love coming there.


934
0:34:27,273 --> 0:34:28,814
And they have nice
buildings, but one


935
0:34:28,814 --> 0:34:30,1
of the things that
the train-- maybe you


936
0:34:30,1 --> 0:34:32,21
know this-- they teach
them to do something


937
0:34:32,21 --> 0:34:33,719
called the 10-5
Way, which is if you


938
0:34:33,719 --> 0:34:36,2
walk within 10 feet of
somebody at a Ritz Carlton,


939
0:34:36,2 --> 0:34:38,21
they're trained to make eye
contact and smile at you.


940
0:34:38,21 --> 0:34:41,9
And within 5 feet, the employees
are trained to say hello.


941
0:34:41,9 --> 0:34:42,81
It's actually really
fun to go in and out


942
0:34:42,81 --> 0:34:45,235
of those sphere with
them at the Ritz,


943
0:34:45,235 --> 0:34:46,61
even if you're
not staying there.


944
0:34:46,61 --> 0:34:48,151
But what we love
about the experience


945
0:34:48,151 --> 0:34:50,4
is that we could import
it down to this hospital,


946
0:34:50,4 --> 0:34:51,8
to these groups of hospitals.


947
0:34:51,8 --> 0:34:54,25
And we trained them
post-Katrina down in Louisiana.


948
0:34:54,25 --> 0:34:56,25
And some of the doctors
were like, why would you


949
0:34:56,25 --> 0:34:58,37
have to train people to smile?


950
0:34:58,37 --> 0:34:59,97
Isn't that human nature?


951
0:34:59,97 --> 0:35:2,82
But then other doctors
were like, uh, you


952
0:35:2,82 --> 0:35:4,22
hired me to save people's lives.


953
0:35:4,22 --> 0:35:6,874
It doesn't matter how I
walked down the hallways.


954
0:35:6,874 --> 0:35:7,79
I save people's lives.


955
0:35:7,79 --> 0:35:8,47
That's what I'm hired for.


956
0:35:8,47 --> 0:35:11,23
I'm not going to do this stupid
smiling initiative from HR.


957
0:35:11,23 --> 0:35:12,37
So we said, that's fine.


958
0:35:12,37 --> 0:35:14,74
But then we trained
11,000 of their coworkers


959
0:35:14,74 --> 0:35:17,69
to make eye contact and
smile and to do the 10-5 Way.


960
0:35:17,69 --> 0:35:20,24
And what happens is
everyone started picking up


961
0:35:20,24 --> 0:35:22,54
the pattern, the doctors,
and nurses, the staff.


962
0:35:22,54 --> 0:35:24,32
But the cool part
was the patients,


963
0:35:24,32 --> 0:35:25,81
who didn't know
what was going on,


964
0:35:25,81 --> 0:35:28,75
picked up and then started
initiating the social script,


965
0:35:28,75 --> 0:35:31,71
because they were learning that
when I walk down this hallway


966
0:35:31,71 --> 0:35:35,755
I'm supposed to treat people
as if they're human beings.


967
0:35:35,755 --> 0:35:37,38
We pick up social
scripts all the time.


968
0:35:37,38 --> 0:35:42,8
If you get onto subway in
New York or The T in Boston,


969
0:35:42,8 --> 0:35:43,69
you start smiling,
some people start


970
0:35:43,69 --> 0:35:45,2
moving away from you, right?


971
0:35:45,2 --> 0:35:46,72
Because we know
the social script.


972
0:35:46,72 --> 0:35:48,38
Let's not necessarily
do eye contact,


973
0:35:48,38 --> 0:35:50,21
and let's not actually
smile at strangers.


974
0:35:50,21 --> 0:35:51,91
We know that rule.


975
0:35:51,91 --> 0:35:54,714
But part of what we
were finding was not


976
0:35:54,714 --> 0:35:56,13
only did hospital
hallways change,


977
0:35:56,13 --> 0:35:58,89
which would be a cute story
about how hospitals can change,


978
0:35:58,89 --> 0:36:0,879
what I was interested
in is what happened


979
0:36:0,879 --> 0:36:2,67
six months later to
their business outcome.


980
0:36:2,67 --> 0:36:5,55
Six months later, the
hospitals that did this,


981
0:36:5,55 --> 0:36:9,89
they saw a significant increase
in their unique patients


982
0:36:9,89 --> 0:36:11,62
that came to the hospital.


983
0:36:11,62 --> 0:36:12,52
The likelihood of
patients to refer


984
0:36:12,52 --> 0:36:15,4
the care, the quality of care
that they received skyrocketed.


985
0:36:15,4 --> 0:36:17,39
And the doctors'
happiness level at work


986
0:36:17,39 --> 0:36:19,43
were the highest not only
in the hospital chain


987
0:36:19,43 --> 0:36:21,8
but in a decade at
that organization.


988
0:36:21,8 --> 0:36:23,75
That's a one-second
behavioral change


989
0:36:23,75 --> 0:36:26,62
that shows we can change the
social script around this


990
0:36:26,62 --> 0:36:29,14
and actually impact not only
our happiness but the quality


991
0:36:29,14 --> 0:36:31,99
of care that we provide
and our business outcomes.


992
0:36:31,99 --> 0:36:35,372
My question-- and it's the one
that you have been championing


993
0:36:35,372 --> 0:36:37,705
here at Google-- is, what if
we had more than one second


994
0:36:37,705 --> 0:36:38,73
with somebody?


995
0:36:38,73 --> 0:36:40,94
What if we could change
somebody not just short-term?


996
0:36:40,94 --> 0:36:43,23
But what if we could
actually change the very lens


997
0:36:43,23 --> 0:36:44,51
with which we viewed the world?


998
0:36:44,51 --> 0:36:47,28
And that's where things become
really powerful, I think.


999
0:36:47,28 --> 0:36:48,45
CHADE-MENG TAN: I have
a suggestion for that--


1000
0:36:48,45 --> 0:36:48,84
SHAWN ACHOR: Yes.


1001
0:36:48,84 --> 0:36:50,33
CHADE-MENG TAN: --wish
is to look at human being


1002
0:36:50,33 --> 0:36:52,5
and to think, I wish for
this person to be happy.


1003
0:36:52,5 --> 0:36:54,58
You don't have to
do or say anything.


1004
0:36:54,58 --> 0:36:55,82
Just think.


1005
0:36:55,82 --> 0:36:59,22
And that thought alone
changes everything.


1006
0:36:59,22 --> 0:37:1,51
Because it changes
your facial expression,


1007
0:37:1,51 --> 0:37:4,75
changes your behavior,
and eventually people,


1008
0:37:4,75 --> 0:37:7,18
they like each other, and
they don't really know why.


1009
0:37:7,18 --> 0:37:8,88
This operates on an
unconscious level.


1010
0:37:8,88 --> 0:37:9,63
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.


1011
0:37:9,63 --> 0:37:11,13
CHADE-MENG TAN: So I
suggest that to everybody,


1012
0:37:11,13 --> 0:37:11,84
that one thought.


1013
0:37:11,84 --> 0:37:13,91
I wish for this guy to be happy.


1014
0:37:13,91 --> 0:37:15,26
And then leave it at that.


1015
0:37:15,26 --> 0:37:16,49
See what happens.


1016
0:37:16,49 --> 0:37:17,82
SHAWN ACHOR: That's cool.


1017
0:37:17,82 --> 0:37:20,19
CHADE-MENG TAN: Oh, I love
how you say it's beautiful.


1018
0:37:20,19 --> 0:37:21,6
I see it, and I raise you one--


1019
0:37:21,6 --> 0:37:22,2
SHAWN ACHOR: OK.


1020
0:37:22,2 --> 0:37:22,78
CHADE-MENG TAN:
--which is I think


1021
0:37:22,78 --> 0:37:24,86
that in addition
happiness is contagious.


1022
0:37:24,86 --> 0:37:28,55
The other thing I found to
be contagious is calmness.


1023
0:37:28,55 --> 0:37:32,37
If you walk into a room in
a meditative, calm state,


1024
0:37:32,37 --> 0:37:34,48
no matter how bad things
are, if you walk in


1025
0:37:34,48 --> 0:37:38,8
and sit down meditatively
calm, it starts to spread.


1026
0:37:38,8 --> 0:37:39,84
People start calming down.


1027
0:37:39,84 --> 0:37:41,66
So for those of you
who are meditators,


1028
0:37:41,66 --> 0:37:47,99
practice that in a meeting
where things are not going well.


1029
0:37:47,99 --> 0:37:49,11
Give that a try.


1030
0:37:49,11 --> 0:37:50,75
See if you can change anything.


1031
0:37:50,75 --> 0:37:52,47
And sometimes people notice.


1032
0:37:52,47 --> 0:37:55,836
That guy, every time he walks
in the room, something changes.


1033
0:37:55,836 --> 0:37:56,96
See if that happens to you.


1034
0:37:56,96 --> 0:37:58,1
SHAWN ACHOR: That's cool.


1035
0:37:58,1 --> 0:38:2,4
CHADE-MENG TAN: Which leads
me to the next question.


1036
0:38:2,4 --> 0:38:4,62
The thing I really like
about this book are


1037
0:38:4,62 --> 0:38:7,34
two words that you use,
which I thought was genius.


1038
0:38:7,34 --> 0:38:10,52
And the words you use
are positive genius.


1039
0:38:10,52 --> 0:38:13,92
And can you talk about
what is a positive genius


1040
0:38:13,92 --> 0:38:16,18
and how that relates to
happiness and success?


1041
0:38:16,18 --> 0:38:17,58
SHAWN ACHOR: Sure.


1042
0:38:17,58 --> 0:38:20,87
So only 25% of your
successes here at Google


1043
0:38:20,87 --> 0:38:22,67
are predicted based
upon your intelligence


1044
0:38:22,67 --> 0:38:24,135
and technical skills.


1045
0:38:24,135 --> 0:38:25,69
CHADE-MENG TAN: The rest
is their good looks, right?


1046
0:38:25,69 --> 0:38:27,231
SHAWN ACHOR: The
rest are good looks.


1047
0:38:27,231 --> 0:38:28,28
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


1048
0:38:28,28 --> 0:38:31,1
SHAWN ACHOR: Which we know from
tech, financials, and medicals,


1049
0:38:31,1 --> 0:38:33,72
where I thought IQ would
matter more, it doesn't.


1050
0:38:33,72 --> 0:38:37,5
About 25% of job success is
predicted by how smart you are.


1051
0:38:37,5 --> 0:38:39,8
75% of your successes
are predicted


1052
0:38:39,8 --> 0:38:41,85
by three other
factors, your optimism,


1053
0:38:41,85 --> 0:38:43,61
the belief that your
behavior matters,


1054
0:38:43,61 --> 0:38:46,71
your social connections, and
the way you perceive stress.


1055
0:38:46,71 --> 0:38:48,71
What we found are that
there's these individuals


1056
0:38:48,71 --> 0:38:51,74
and organizations-- and not
even organizations, nonprofits


1057
0:38:51,74 --> 0:38:56,162
and families-- that we call
positive geniuses, who,


1058
0:38:56,162 --> 0:38:58,62
regardless of the environment
that they find themselves in,


1059
0:38:58,62 --> 0:39:1,81
are able to continually
architect these realities that


1060
0:39:1,81 --> 0:39:4,67
cause them to see past to not
only success but to happiness


1061
0:39:4,67 --> 0:39:6,4
as well.


1062
0:39:6,4 --> 0:39:8,205
Your brains are phenomenal.


1063
0:39:8,205 --> 0:39:9,96
Some of you are like,
yeah, I knew that.


1064
0:39:9,96 --> 0:39:11,5
That's why I work here.


1065
0:39:11,5 --> 0:39:12,78
But your brain can
process about 40 bits


1066
0:39:12,78 --> 0:39:15,17
of information per second,
which is really fast.


1067
0:39:15,17 --> 0:39:17,68
The only problem is your brain
receives 11 million pieces


1068
0:39:17,68 --> 0:39:20,46
of information per second from
all of your nerve endings.


1069
0:39:20,46 --> 0:39:22,67
So as you're constructing
a picture of the world,


1070
0:39:22,67 --> 0:39:26,44
your brain picks and chooses
two to four small facts,


1071
0:39:26,44 --> 0:39:29,1
and then you architect an
entire reality around them.


1072
0:39:29,1 --> 0:39:32,384
And if we know what those
facts are for you, if we


1073
0:39:32,384 --> 0:39:34,8
hear how you're describing
your work or your relationships


1074
0:39:34,8 --> 0:39:37,89
or your life, those facts
you go to immediately,


1075
0:39:37,89 --> 0:39:38,88
those actually predict
not only your levels


1076
0:39:38,88 --> 0:39:40,96
of happiness and
your stress levels


1077
0:39:40,96 --> 0:39:43,61
and how calm you are, but it
predicts your success rates,


1078
0:39:43,61 --> 0:39:46,82
your educational outcomes, your
health outcomes in the future.


1079
0:39:46,82 --> 0:39:49,4
Part of what we found is
that these positive geniuses


1080
0:39:49,4 --> 0:39:52,34
have practiced or have
created these patterns where


1081
0:39:52,34 --> 0:39:55,48
they can continually architect
these positive realities over


1082
0:39:55,48 --> 0:39:56,296
and over again.


1083
0:39:56,296 --> 0:39:57,67
And what I loved
about this is it


1084
0:39:57,67 --> 0:39:59,128
was something that
could be taught.


1085
0:39:59,128 --> 0:40:3,6
I think one of the deepest and
coolest parts of this research


1086
0:40:3,6 --> 0:40:5,27
in positive psychology
is this idea


1087
0:40:5,27 --> 0:40:8,6
that I believe at base is
just that change is possible,


1088
0:40:8,6 --> 0:40:11,84
which I actually think
most people would give


1089
0:40:11,84 --> 0:40:14,125
lip service to but don't
actually believe that.


1090
0:40:14,125 --> 0:40:17,15
Because I think most people
think that just their genes


1091
0:40:17,15 --> 0:40:19,442
are their environment,
that that person's happy


1092
0:40:19,442 --> 0:40:20,65
because they were born happy.


1093
0:40:20,65 --> 0:40:24,55
Or I'm happy because
I was born optimistic


1094
0:40:24,55 --> 0:40:26,285
or my parents were
optimistic, and that's


1095
0:40:26,285 --> 0:40:27,16
the end of the story.


1096
0:40:27,16 --> 0:40:29,91
Or there are some people
that are pessimistic as well.


1097
0:40:29,91 --> 0:40:33,16
There is a researcher up in
Minnesota who's studying twins.


1098
0:40:33,16 --> 0:40:35,28
And they found if you
take identical twins


1099
0:40:35,28 --> 0:40:37,115
and raise them apart--
they were already


1100
0:40:37,115 --> 0:40:38,734
going to be raised apart.


1101
0:40:38,734 --> 0:40:40,15
They didn't do
that for the study,


1102
0:40:40,15 --> 0:40:43,6
but that they have
identical twins raised


1103
0:40:43,6 --> 0:40:46,94
different families, different
environment, same genes,


1104
0:40:46,94 --> 0:40:49,499
and what they found is,
on average, the levels


1105
0:40:49,499 --> 0:40:50,79
of happiness were very similar.


1106
0:40:50,79 --> 0:40:53,57
So he concluded 80% of
your long-term happiness


1107
0:40:53,57 --> 0:40:56,14
is based upon your
genes, which actually I


1108
0:40:56,14 --> 0:40:57,864
believe most people believe.


1109
0:40:57,864 --> 0:40:59,53
They think the majority
of our happiness


1110
0:40:59,53 --> 0:41:3,304
is based upon the way your brain
was wired from the beginning.


1111
0:41:3,304 --> 0:41:4,72
And if you believe
that statement,


1112
0:41:4,72 --> 0:41:6,44
you have to believe
the next one, which


1113
0:41:6,44 --> 0:41:8,31
is his famous statement.


1114
0:41:8,31 --> 0:41:10,66
Stop trying to change
your happiness.


1115
0:41:10,66 --> 0:41:12,53
You're as likely to
change your happiness


1116
0:41:12,53 --> 0:41:14,8
as to change your
height, which is also


1117
0:41:14,8 --> 0:41:16,497
80% determined by genes.


1118
0:41:16,497 --> 0:41:18,83
He's since recanted that
statement, because it turns out


1119
0:41:18,83 --> 0:41:20,58
he was only half right,
which in this case


1120
0:41:20,58 --> 0:41:22,37
makes him fully wrong.


1121
0:41:22,37 --> 0:41:24,865
Because genes do set
the initial baseline.


1122
0:41:24,865 --> 0:41:27,72



1123
0:41:27,72 --> 0:41:29,58
We can shine a light
at a three-day-old,


1124
0:41:29,58 --> 0:41:32,372
and if they turn towards that
light and that auditory click,


1125
0:41:32,372 --> 0:41:34,58
they're trying to increase
their neocortical arousal,


1126
0:41:34,58 --> 0:41:37,12
and they're more likely to
be an extrovert at age 10.


1127
0:41:37,12 --> 0:41:38,47
They turn away from
it, and they're


1128
0:41:38,47 --> 0:41:39,922
more likely to be an introvert.


1129
0:41:39,922 --> 0:41:40,63
That's day three.


1130
0:41:40,63 --> 0:41:42,838
We haven't even had time to
screw them up yet, right?


1131
0:41:42,838 --> 0:41:45,7
They've got these
predispositions for this.


1132
0:41:45,7 --> 0:41:46,99
Some of you,
genetically happiness


1133
0:41:46,99 --> 0:41:49,33
is a much easier choice
than it is for other people.


1134
0:41:49,33 --> 0:41:51,97
Same thing with obesity,
with alcoholism,


1135
0:41:51,97 --> 0:41:53,62
all of these different
types of things.


1136
0:41:53,62 --> 0:41:55,75
But that's only the
beginning of the story.


1137
0:41:55,75 --> 0:41:58,94
The reason why we keep finding
genes to be so important


1138
0:41:58,94 --> 0:42:2,977
is that average person
doesn't fight their genes.


1139
0:42:2,977 --> 0:42:5,56
And if you've seen my TED Talk,
one of the things I talk about


1140
0:42:5,56 --> 0:42:7,477
is how most of
our research we're


1141
0:42:7,477 --> 0:42:8,56
interested in the average.


1142
0:42:8,56 --> 0:42:10,851
We want to find out how many
aspirin the average person


1143
0:42:10,851 --> 0:42:12,69
should take if they
get a headache, which


1144
0:42:12,69 --> 0:42:14,23
we should already see a problem.


1145
0:42:14,23 --> 0:42:17,24
Because regardless if you're
90 pounds or 250 pounds, yeah,


1146
0:42:17,24 --> 0:42:19,94
about two pills should do it.


1147
0:42:19,94 --> 0:42:22,9
But as soon as we ask
questions about potential,


1148
0:42:22,9 --> 0:42:24,82
about happiness, about
optimism, about success,


1149
0:42:24,82 --> 0:42:27,352
those are a different
group of questions.


1150
0:42:27,352 --> 0:42:29,31
And when we ask questions
like that, what we do


1151
0:42:29,31 --> 0:42:31,9
is we create a cult
of the average.


1152
0:42:31,9 --> 0:42:33,28
Because if we ask questions
like, how fast can


1153
0:42:33,28 --> 0:42:35,769
a child learn how to
read?-- and in our research,


1154
0:42:35,769 --> 0:42:37,81
we changed it to, how fast
does the average child


1155
0:42:37,81 --> 0:42:40,0
learn how to read, and then
we tailor the classes right


1156
0:42:40,0 --> 0:42:40,874
towards that average.


1157
0:42:40,874 --> 0:42:42,2
Same thing with genes.


1158
0:42:42,2 --> 0:42:45,2
If we look at how much genes
matter, we look at the average,


1159
0:42:45,2 --> 0:42:47,174
and the average
person does not fight


1160
0:42:47,174 --> 0:42:48,59
their genes and
their environment.


1161
0:42:48,59 --> 0:42:51,48
But if you look at those same
graphs with those same twins,


1162
0:42:51,48 --> 0:42:53,68
we find that they can
scatter dramatically


1163
0:42:53,68 --> 0:42:56,5
from their genetic set point
and from our environment.


1164
0:42:56,5 --> 0:42:59,65
Only 10% of your long-term
levels of happiness


1165
0:42:59,65 --> 0:43:1,8
are predicted based
upon the external world.


1166
0:43:1,8 --> 0:43:3,88
90% of your long-term
levels of happiness


1167
0:43:3,88 --> 0:43:7,41
is predicted by how your brain
processes that external world.


1168
0:43:7,41 --> 0:43:9,85
And one of the things we found--
and there might be people


1169
0:43:9,85 --> 0:43:12,38
here in the room, you've
seen a change in your life.


1170
0:43:12,38 --> 0:43:15,472
You've actually seen how you've
become more optimistic or more


1171
0:43:15,472 --> 0:43:17,93
jaded in your life, whatever
direction you've been going on


1172
0:43:17,93 --> 0:43:21,16
that trajectory-- I was
telling you this morning,


1173
0:43:21,16 --> 0:43:24,73
I had an identical twin come
up to me after one of my talks


1174
0:43:24,73 --> 0:43:29,2
and she said, I used to be
a very negative person, just


1175
0:43:29,2 --> 0:43:32,3
like my sister, but now
I'm extremely positive.


1176
0:43:32,3 --> 0:43:33,23
I'm like, that's amazing.


1177
0:43:33,23 --> 0:43:34,31
What did you do?


1178
0:43:34,31 --> 0:43:36,28
How did you break that
cycle from your genes?


1179
0:43:36,28 --> 0:43:37,37
That's what I study.


1180
0:43:37,37 --> 0:43:40,13
And she thought about it,
and she was like, actually,


1181
0:43:40,13 --> 0:43:42,17
I think it happened
when I was 15.


1182
0:43:42,17 --> 0:43:45,96
I was involved in a horrific
car accident, and I almost died.


1183
0:43:45,96 --> 0:43:49,112
And I realized that
life was a privilege


1184
0:43:49,112 --> 0:43:50,82
and that I had a whole
new lease on life.


1185
0:43:50,82 --> 0:43:53,1
And from then on,
I've seen the world


1186
0:43:53,1 --> 0:43:54,36
in a completely different way.


1187
0:43:54,36 --> 0:43:58,62
What I love about that is that's
a trauma that caused growth.


1188
0:43:58,62 --> 0:44:0,42
It wasn't just
post-traumatic stress,


1189
0:44:0,42 --> 0:44:1,69
which is all we hear about.


1190
0:44:1,69 --> 0:44:4,61
But actually, it was trauma
that caused somebody to not only


1191
0:44:4,61 --> 0:44:8,13
grow, create post-traumatic
growth but a deviation


1192
0:44:8,13 --> 0:44:9,1
from our genes.


1193
0:44:9,1 --> 0:44:11,91
And that is what I find that
these positive geniuses are


1194
0:44:11,91 --> 0:44:15,1
able to do is to realize
that they can actually


1195
0:44:15,1 --> 0:44:17,47
be co-creators of the
lens with which they view


1196
0:44:17,47 --> 0:44:19,94
the world with their
environment and their genes,


1197
0:44:19,94 --> 0:44:22,93
so much so we can get people
with genes for pessimism


1198
0:44:22,93 --> 0:44:26,59
to act in the world and to
become high-level optimists.


1199
0:44:26,59 --> 0:44:28,36
We actually haven't
found anyone who


1200
0:44:28,36 --> 0:44:30,316
is not capable of
changing if they're


1201
0:44:30,316 --> 0:44:32,69
willing to be able to make
some of these positive changes


1202
0:44:32,69 --> 0:44:34,414
within their life,
which shows us


1203
0:44:34,414 --> 0:44:36,83
that if we just push against
our environment and our genes


1204
0:44:36,83 --> 0:44:38,79
and create some of
these positive habits


1205
0:44:38,79 --> 0:44:41,549
that you've been doing here
at Google and the programs


1206
0:44:41,549 --> 0:44:43,34
where you get people
to create these ideas,


1207
0:44:43,34 --> 0:44:46,331
if you take advantage of some
of the exercise equipment


1208
0:44:46,331 --> 0:44:48,8
and all of the incredible
things you have,


1209
0:44:48,8 --> 0:44:51,575
you can actually get people to
change from their genetic set


1210
0:44:51,575 --> 0:44:53,996
point and create a whole new
trajectory, which is amazing.


1211
0:44:53,996 --> 0:44:54,87
CHADE-MENG TAN: Yeah.


1212
0:44:54,87 --> 0:44:55,79
Thank you.


1213
0:44:55,79 --> 0:44:58,1
So Alex has the mic.


1214
0:44:58,1 --> 0:45:0,232
Let's get some questions
from the audience.


1215
0:45:0,232 --> 0:45:2,44
Yeah, Alex, you get to choose
who to give the mic to.


1216
0:45:2,44 --> 0:45:3,979
He has the power.


1217
0:45:3,979 --> 0:45:4,52
AUDIENCE: Hi.


1218
0:45:4,52 --> 0:45:6,89
A direct follow-up to
what you just said.


1219
0:45:6,89 --> 0:45:10,87
I grew up with the
quote 10% of the world


1220
0:45:10,87 --> 0:45:13,98
is what you make
of it, and 90% is


1221
0:45:13,98 --> 0:45:16,6
how you take it, which is
kind of what you just said.


1222
0:45:16,6 --> 0:45:18,21
You said 90% of
your happiness is


1223
0:45:18,21 --> 0:45:20,902
based on how you process
your external world.


1224
0:45:20,902 --> 0:45:23,694
Do you have some
scientific fact?


1225
0:45:23,694 --> 0:45:25,11
How did you come
up with that 90%?


1226
0:45:25,11 --> 0:45:27,86
Because before I thought
that that was made up.


1227
0:45:27,86 --> 0:45:29,7
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.


1228
0:45:29,7 --> 0:45:31,0
That research comes
from a researcher


1229
0:45:31,0 --> 0:45:32,3
named Sonja Lyubomirsky.


1230
0:45:32,3 --> 0:45:34,38
And part of what they
were looking at initially


1231
0:45:34,38 --> 0:45:37,45
was if we know your
external world,


1232
0:45:37,45 --> 0:45:40,24
we can predict short-term
happiness very easily.


1233
0:45:40,24 --> 0:45:42,15
If a stock goes
down, your happiness


1234
0:45:42,15 --> 0:45:43,97
goes down, unless
you short the stock.


1235
0:45:43,97 --> 0:45:47,41
Or if something
bad happens to you,


1236
0:45:47,41 --> 0:45:49,89
immediately you have
a response period.


1237
0:45:49,89 --> 0:45:53,0
If you don't actually have a
response period completely,


1238
0:45:53,0 --> 0:45:56,22
sometimes that can
actually be problematic.


1239
0:45:56,22 --> 0:45:58,79
I don't study people that
are happy all the time,


1240
0:45:58,79 --> 0:46:3,2
because that can actually be a
form of a disorder where they


1241
0:46:3,2 --> 0:46:3,78
don't--


1242
0:46:3,78 --> 0:46:4,94
CHADE-MENG TAN: Or
they live in Colorado.


1243
0:46:4,94 --> 0:46:5,815
SHAWN ACHOR: Exactly.


1244
0:46:5,815 --> 0:46:12,695
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


1245
0:46:12,695 --> 0:46:14,7
SHAWN ACHOR: So
anyway, what they


1246
0:46:14,7 --> 0:46:22,6
found was your happiness levels
in aggregate over time, which


1247
0:46:22,6 --> 0:46:25,24
is when we watch your
patterns move, only 10% of it


1248
0:46:25,24 --> 0:46:27,67
was predicted by any of
those external factors


1249
0:46:27,67 --> 0:46:28,83
that we were looking for.


1250
0:46:28,83 --> 0:46:30,413
So the rest of it
had to be determined


1251
0:46:30,413 --> 0:46:33,594
based upon your genes and what
she calls the voluntary actions


1252
0:46:33,594 --> 0:46:34,51
you make in your life.


1253
0:46:34,51 --> 0:46:36,962
Those are the habits.


1254
0:46:36,962 --> 0:46:38,42
I like where she's
going with this,


1255
0:46:38,42 --> 0:46:40,386
and it's helpful sometimes
to say those things.


1256
0:46:40,386 --> 0:46:42,51
But I also think we get
stuck with the percentages.


1257
0:46:42,51 --> 0:46:49,914
Because if I'm born with genes
for pessimism-- actually,


1258
0:46:49,914 --> 0:46:51,83
I was born probably with
genes for depression.


1259
0:46:51,83 --> 0:46:54,17
I actually went through two
years of depression myself


1260
0:46:54,17 --> 0:46:57,24
when I was at Harvard while
I was at the Divinity School.


1261
0:46:57,24 --> 0:47:1,28
And as I was coming out of that,
what was helping me pull out


1262
0:47:1,28 --> 0:47:3,679
of it was positive psychology
and some of these habits


1263
0:47:3,679 --> 0:47:4,47
that we were doing.


1264
0:47:4,47 --> 0:47:7,21
I was doing this journaling
exercise where you actually


1265
0:47:7,21 --> 0:47:8,69
journal about
positive experience


1266
0:47:8,69 --> 0:47:10,35
and meaningful
experience over the day.


1267
0:47:10,35 --> 0:47:11,74
And because our
brains can't tell


1268
0:47:11,74 --> 0:47:13,239
the difference
between visualization


1269
0:47:13,239 --> 0:47:16,6
and actual experience,
it doubles the experience


1270
0:47:16,6 --> 0:47:19,5
for the brain, and you
start to see more meaning.


1271
0:47:19,5 --> 0:47:22,434
Even though I have
genes for that,


1272
0:47:22,434 --> 0:47:24,85
I don't actually experience
depression very much any more.


1273
0:47:24,85 --> 0:47:26,92
And when I start to go down
into a trough a little bit,


1274
0:47:26,92 --> 0:47:29,64
I know it's short-lived, and I
can actually pop back out of it


1275
0:47:29,64 --> 0:47:31,2
faster and faster now.


1276
0:47:31,2 --> 0:47:33,13
And if that's the
case, then how much are


1277
0:47:33,13 --> 0:47:35,35
the genes mattering
at this point?


1278
0:47:35,35 --> 0:47:37,61
Are the genes starting
to go from 40% down


1279
0:47:37,61 --> 0:47:40,49
to 30% down to 0%?


1280
0:47:40,49 --> 0:47:42,64
If I have genes for
pessimism but I'm


1281
0:47:42,64 --> 0:47:46,81
acting like an optimist,
maybe they have 0% of effect


1282
0:47:46,81 --> 0:47:47,52
upon people.


1283
0:47:47,52 --> 0:47:50,26
So part of what I think
is just the recognition


1284
0:47:50,26 --> 0:47:52,41
that the external
world does not have


1285
0:47:52,41 --> 0:47:55,32
a tyranny over people's
levels of happiness, which


1286
0:47:55,32 --> 0:47:57,14
is why if you've
traveled a lot you've


1287
0:47:57,14 --> 0:48:1,35
seen-- I've worked with very
wealthy bankers who have just


1288
0:48:1,35 --> 0:48:4,67
been so depressed and devastated
in the middle of a banking


1289
0:48:4,67 --> 0:48:5,4
crisis.


1290
0:48:5,4 --> 0:48:7,35
And I've worked with
farmers in Zimbabwe who


1291
0:48:7,35 --> 0:48:10,29
lost their land who are living
under a military dictator,


1292
0:48:10,29 --> 0:48:12,33
and they're some of the
most optimistic people


1293
0:48:12,33 --> 0:48:13,35
I've ever met.


1294
0:48:13,35 --> 0:48:16,5
So I think it goes
with the common sense


1295
0:48:16,5 --> 0:48:18,58
that we can find people
within every environment that


1296
0:48:18,58 --> 0:48:19,88
are positive and negative.


1297
0:48:19,88 --> 0:48:22,64
I think the key, though,
is how do we view reality.


1298
0:48:22,64 --> 0:48:25,12
Because I was actually
out in northern California


1299
0:48:25,12 --> 0:48:28,17
out here speaking to a
group of software companies,


1300
0:48:28,17 --> 0:48:30,44
all CEOs of these top
software companies.


1301
0:48:30,44 --> 0:48:32,51
You probably know
all these people.


1302
0:48:32,51 --> 0:48:35,6
And one of the CEOs offered
to drive me to the airport


1303
0:48:35,6 --> 0:48:38,442
after my talk, because
he wanted to figure out


1304
0:48:38,442 --> 0:48:40,25
how we could cascade
this research out


1305
0:48:40,25 --> 0:48:41,66
through his organization.


1306
0:48:41,66 --> 0:48:42,69
And so I got into
his really nice car


1307
0:48:42,69 --> 0:48:45,15
and put on my seat belt, and
he got in on the other side


1308
0:48:45,15 --> 0:48:46,51
and immediately started
talking to me about what


1309
0:48:46,51 --> 0:48:48,843
his company was experiencing,
all the change and stress.


1310
0:48:48,843 --> 0:48:50,85
And that bell was
going off in his car


1311
0:48:50,85 --> 0:48:52,433
because he hadn't
put on his seat belt


1312
0:48:52,433 --> 0:48:54,795
yet and just kept going off
and eventually got tired


1313
0:48:54,795 --> 0:48:55,91
and just stopped.


1314
0:48:55,91 --> 0:48:58,436
And I turned to
him and I was like,


1315
0:48:58,436 --> 0:48:59,56
you don't wear a seat belt?


1316
0:48:59,56 --> 0:49:2,1
And he said, no, I
listened to your talk.


1317
0:49:2,1 --> 0:49:3,21
I love your research.


1318
0:49:3,21 --> 0:49:4,28
I'm an optimist.


1319
0:49:4,28 --> 0:49:5,49
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


1320
0:49:5,49 --> 0:49:8,95
SHAWN ACHOR: I was like,
oh, you're an idiot.


1321
0:49:8,95 --> 0:49:10,439
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


1322
0:49:10,439 --> 0:49:12,23
SHAWN ACHOR: But I'd
love to work with you.


1323
0:49:12,23 --> 0:49:14,68
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


1324
0:49:14,68 --> 0:49:17,55
SHAWN ACHOR: Optimism is
great for a lot of things,


1325
0:49:17,55 --> 0:49:19,97
but it doesn't stop
cars from hitting us.


1326
0:49:19,97 --> 0:49:22,39
It doesn't stop reality
from impinging upon us.


1327
0:49:22,39 --> 0:49:24,21
And that's irrational optimism.


1328
0:49:24,21 --> 0:49:25,81
And there's books
and ideas out there


1329
0:49:25,81 --> 0:49:27,51
that if you're like, if
I just change my mindset,


1330
0:49:27,51 --> 0:49:28,87
everything will change for me.


1331
0:49:28,87 --> 0:49:30,7
And that's actually irrational.


1332
0:49:30,7 --> 0:49:33,66
Because if you
sugarcoat the present,


1333
0:49:33,66 --> 0:49:35,7
we make bad decisions
in the future.


1334
0:49:35,7 --> 0:49:38,5
And if we think that
reality won't impact us,


1335
0:49:38,5 --> 0:49:40,56
we don't make any
changes to that reality,


1336
0:49:40,56 --> 0:49:44,29
and it causes us to be blind
to injustices that are going on


1337
0:49:44,29 --> 0:49:47,55
in the world or to racism
or to weaknesses in our life


1338
0:49:47,55 --> 0:49:49,24
that we want to improve.


1339
0:49:49,24 --> 0:49:51,13
Irrational optimists
don't put on a seat belt


1340
0:49:51,13 --> 0:49:52,37
because they don't think
anything bad can happen


1341
0:49:52,37 --> 0:49:54,94
to them, and a pessimist
doesn't put on a seat belt


1342
0:49:54,94 --> 0:49:57,32
because they think they're
going to die anyway.


1343
0:49:57,32 --> 0:50:0,7
But a rational optimist, which
is what I'm hoping people


1344
0:50:0,7 --> 0:50:3,7
go for with this idea,
rational optimism


1345
0:50:3,7 --> 0:50:5,67
doesn't start with
rose-colored glasses.


1346
0:50:5,67 --> 0:50:8,6
It starts with a realistic
assessment of the present, both


1347
0:50:8,6 --> 0:50:11,17
the good and the bad,
but maintains the belief


1348
0:50:11,17 --> 0:50:12,419
that our behavior matters.


1349
0:50:12,419 --> 0:50:14,21
It's linked to our
social support networks.


1350
0:50:14,21 --> 0:50:15,2
I love that.


1351
0:50:15,2 --> 0:50:17,42
The rational optimism takes
a realistic assessment


1352
0:50:17,42 --> 0:50:18,85
of the present
first but maintains


1353
0:50:18,85 --> 0:50:20,24
the belief my behavior matters.


1354
0:50:20,24 --> 0:50:21,79
It's linked to the
people around me.


1355
0:50:21,79 --> 0:50:26,3
And that, I think, is where
we want to go with this.


1356
0:50:26,3 --> 0:50:28,35
I get people after
my talks who say,


1357
0:50:28,35 --> 0:50:30,55
I'm not an optimist
or a pessimist.


1358
0:50:30,55 --> 0:50:33,1
I'm just a realist
right now, which


1359
0:50:33,1 --> 0:50:34,752
usually means
they're a pessimist.


1360
0:50:34,752 --> 0:50:37,98
But what they're saying
is actually nonsensical,


1361
0:50:37,98 --> 0:50:39,99
because both optimists
and pessimists


1362
0:50:39,99 --> 0:50:41,55
can both be realists.


1363
0:50:41,55 --> 0:50:44,36
Realism's seeing the problems
in this world and in our work


1364
0:50:44,36 --> 0:50:45,37
and in our lives.


1365
0:50:45,37 --> 0:50:48,43
Optimism and pessimism is what
happens after the problem.


1366
0:50:48,43 --> 0:50:49,79
So you have to see reality.


1367
0:50:49,79 --> 0:50:51,69
You know that reality
has an impact.


1368
0:50:51,69 --> 0:50:53,7
But do I believe
that that problem is


1369
0:50:53,7 --> 0:50:55,98
permanent and pervasive,
it affects everything,


1370
0:50:55,98 --> 0:50:58,62
or it's local, it's one
part of your reality,


1371
0:50:58,62 --> 0:50:59,7
and that it's temporary?


1372
0:50:59,7 --> 0:51:0,67
This too will pass.


1373
0:51:0,67 --> 0:51:2,81
That's where we want
people to get to,


1374
0:51:2,81 --> 0:51:4,67
not to ignore the
reality but to realize


1375
0:51:4,67 --> 0:51:5,67
that they can change it.


1376
0:51:5,67 --> 0:51:7,36
So I love that quote
that you were talking


1377
0:51:7,36 --> 0:51:9,693
about that you grew up with,
because it really is about,


1378
0:51:9,693 --> 0:51:12,88
how do you take the world that
you have and move forward?


1379
0:51:12,88 --> 0:51:13,52
So thank you.


1380
0:51:13,52 --> 0:51:14,354
AUDIENCE: Thank you.


1381
0:51:14,354 --> 0:51:16,978
AUDIENCE: I've heard the saying
you are the average of the five


1382
0:51:16,978 --> 0:51:18,562
people you associate
with the most.


1383
0:51:18,562 --> 0:51:19,27
SHAWN ACHOR: Wow.


1384
0:51:19,27 --> 0:51:21,811
AUDIENCE: And whether
it's five or six,


1385
0:51:21,811 --> 0:51:23,56
I don't think the
quantity really matters.


1386
0:51:23,56 --> 0:51:25,37
And the intent of
the question is


1387
0:51:25,37 --> 0:51:27,62
you grow with the
people around you.


1388
0:51:27,62 --> 0:51:32,24
And so I started to really
question my relationships


1389
0:51:32,24 --> 0:51:36,34
from high school to college and
now Google and moving forward.


1390
0:51:36,34 --> 0:51:39,77
Were these relationships
based-- they've changed so much,


1391
0:51:39,77 --> 0:51:40,66
and people that I
used to care about I


1392
0:51:40,66 --> 0:51:42,3
haven't talked to in so long.


1393
0:51:42,3 --> 0:51:44,9
And I'm progressing
forward in my career,


1394
0:51:44,9 --> 0:51:47,567
and I'm really only
associating with people--


1395
0:51:47,567 --> 0:51:49,65
I try to have genuine
conversations with everyone.


1396
0:51:49,65 --> 0:51:51,16
But then I realized
two years later


1397
0:51:51,16 --> 0:51:53,618
that, oh, I don't even talk to
this person I cared about so


1398
0:51:53,618 --> 0:51:56,29
much, just because he's not
a part of my career anymore.


1399
0:51:56,29 --> 0:51:57,62
Because it's such a
huge part in my life.


1400
0:51:57,62 --> 0:51:58,25
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.


1401
0:51:58,25 --> 0:51:59,666
AUDIENCE: And so
it's really tough


1402
0:51:59,666 --> 0:52:3,75
to see are all my
relationships that superficial


1403
0:52:3,75 --> 0:52:6,7
to the point of
helping me just kind of


1404
0:52:6,7 --> 0:52:8,964
be a more powerful
force in the world?


1405
0:52:8,964 --> 0:52:11,13
Because I think we all care
about changing the world


1406
0:52:11,13 --> 0:52:13,12
and having an impact,
and that's really hard


1407
0:52:13,12 --> 0:52:14,94
when you try to really
build relationships.


1408
0:52:14,94 --> 0:52:16,55
And when you say cut
people out of your life


1409
0:52:16,55 --> 0:52:17,89
that are bringing
you down, it may


1410
0:52:17,89 --> 0:52:20,181
be that they're in a stage
in which they need the most,


1411
0:52:20,181 --> 0:52:23,26
and you've just cut them out.


1412
0:52:23,26 --> 0:52:26,22
Sometimes I reflect on this,
and I go into a very dark place


1413
0:52:26,22 --> 0:52:26,82
very quickly.


1414
0:52:26,82 --> 0:52:28,64
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.


1415
0:52:28,64 --> 0:52:31,5
AUDIENCE: I'm pretty happy
guy, more or less than not.


1416
0:52:31,5 --> 0:52:34,309
But I think about
this stuff a lot,


1417
0:52:34,309 --> 0:52:36,1
and I was wondering
what your opinions are.


1418
0:52:36,1 --> 0:52:37,23
SHAWN ACHOR: Yeah.


1419
0:52:37,23 --> 0:52:39,646
Thank you for sharing that,
because I think about this lot


1420
0:52:39,646 --> 0:52:41,62
too because I find
the same thing.


1421
0:52:41,62 --> 0:52:43,45
It's less about my career.


1422
0:52:43,45 --> 0:52:46,11
It's more about who's in
my immediate vicinity.


1423
0:52:46,11 --> 0:52:48,83
I even saw it with my freshmen
then when I was a Proctor.


1424
0:52:48,83 --> 0:52:51,177
I'd be so close and
tight with my freshmen.


1425
0:52:51,177 --> 0:52:52,76
And then as soon as
they got moved off


1426
0:52:52,76 --> 0:52:55,7
to the River Houses or
the Quad, I was like, OK,


1427
0:52:55,7 --> 0:52:58,172
I've got my new friends,
the new freshmen


1428
0:52:58,172 --> 0:52:59,13
that came in this year.


1429
0:52:59,13 --> 0:53:1,31
And what I found was it was
so frustrating because I cared


1430
0:53:1,31 --> 0:53:3,33
so much about my family
members, these friends


1431
0:53:3,33 --> 0:53:6,4
that I had had in the past, but
they were outside of my sphere,


1432
0:53:6,4 --> 0:53:8,47
because we're so
used to interacting


1433
0:53:8,47 --> 0:53:10,85
with the people that are in
your sphere, which at work,


1434
0:53:10,85 --> 0:53:14,9
if you're focused on work, that
entire sphere might be here.


1435
0:53:14,9 --> 0:53:16,526
So of course the
people closest to you


1436
0:53:16,526 --> 0:53:18,4
might be the people that
are directly related


1437
0:53:18,4 --> 0:53:19,24
to that career.


1438
0:53:19,24 --> 0:53:22,27



1439
0:53:22,27 --> 0:53:24,912
And I make a little bit of fun
of cutting the negative people


1440
0:53:24,912 --> 0:53:26,37
out of our life,
because I actually


1441
0:53:26,37 --> 0:53:27,802
don't want people to do that.


1442
0:53:27,802 --> 0:53:30,1
I think it misses out on
how powerful we can actually


1443
0:53:30,1 --> 0:53:32,93
be in these relationships,
even if they're short-term.


1444
0:53:32,93 --> 0:53:35,48
Because at Yale they
found that if you


1445
0:53:35,48 --> 0:53:37,84
have three strangers
come into the room,


1446
0:53:37,84 --> 0:53:39,43
all with different emotions--


1447
0:53:39,43 --> 0:53:41,62
I get asked a lot,
who's more powerful,


1448
0:53:41,62 --> 0:53:44,23
the positive people in your
life and the negative people?


1449
0:53:44,23 --> 0:53:45,27
You might have a positive
team, but there's


1450
0:53:45,27 --> 0:53:47,9
this one negative guy
on the team that's


1451
0:53:47,9 --> 0:53:49,851
dragging the whole team down, or
one positive person that you're


1452
0:53:49,851 --> 0:53:52,35
talking about that's very calm
that gets everyone else to be


1453
0:53:52,35 --> 0:53:53,23
calm.


1454
0:53:53,23 --> 0:53:54,8
We can't answer that question,
because it's different


1455
0:53:54,8 --> 0:53:55,74
every time we test it.


1456
0:53:55,74 --> 0:53:57,3
Sometimes it's the
positive person.


1457
0:53:57,3 --> 0:53:58,488
Sometimes it's the
negative person.


1458
0:53:58,488 --> 0:54:1,55
What we found is it was
a different variable.


1459
0:54:1,55 --> 0:54:3,55
They found that the other
two people in the room


1460
0:54:3,55 --> 0:54:5,64
leave with an increased
likelihood of experiencing


1461
0:54:5,64 --> 0:54:7,8
the emotions of
the most verbally


1462
0:54:7,8 --> 0:54:10,4
and non-verbally expressive
person in the room.


1463
0:54:10,4 --> 0:54:12,42
So what that means is
verbally or non-verbally,


1464
0:54:12,42 --> 0:54:15,69
if I'm very expressive of my
pessimism or my negativity,


1465
0:54:15,69 --> 0:54:18,11
I'm changing that social script.


1466
0:54:18,11 --> 0:54:20,64
And what we found is social
influence in our lives


1467
0:54:20,64 --> 0:54:22,32
is defined by three
things, the strength


1468
0:54:22,32 --> 0:54:25,49
of our message, the immediacy,
how important that message is


1469
0:54:25,49 --> 0:54:27,145
to people, and the
number of sources


1470
0:54:27,145 --> 0:54:29,68
that are giving
that same message.


1471
0:54:29,68 --> 0:54:33,3
What we found is that if you're
wanting to try and create


1472
0:54:33,3 --> 0:54:34,8
a positive effect
upon other people,


1473
0:54:34,8 --> 0:54:37,55
you want to increase the
strength of that message, to be


1474
0:54:37,55 --> 0:54:39,46
more positive verbally
and non-verbally


1475
0:54:39,46 --> 0:54:43,39
in those relationships to try
and change those five or six


1476
0:54:43,39 --> 0:54:45,867
people that might be
in our average circle.


1477
0:54:45,867 --> 0:54:47,7
But also, you're trying
to increase the end.


1478
0:54:47,7 --> 0:54:50,94
Oftentimes when we think
about those negative people,


1479
0:54:50,94 --> 0:54:51,76
we should actually
not be going straight


1480
0:54:51,76 --> 0:54:52,69
for the negative person.


1481
0:54:52,69 --> 0:54:53,925
We should be increasing
the positivity


1482
0:54:53,925 --> 0:54:56,61
of the people in the middle that
we could tip towards positive


1483
0:54:56,61 --> 0:54:58,38
that help make that
person actually


1484
0:54:58,38 --> 0:55:0,92
see a social script
that's more positive.


1485
0:55:0,92 --> 0:55:2,55
But what's interesting, the
other part about your question,


1486
0:55:2,55 --> 0:55:5,61
is these strong ties versus
weak ties, which I actually


1487
0:55:5,61 --> 0:55:7,19
do a lot of research on.


1488
0:55:7,19 --> 0:55:8,81
Weak ties are actually
much more predictive


1489
0:55:8,81 --> 0:55:11,97
of your long-term success
than the strong ties are.


1490
0:55:11,97 --> 0:55:14,91
Happiness levels,
though, are related


1491
0:55:14,91 --> 0:55:17,97
to both, the breadth and
depth of your relationships.


1492
0:55:17,97 --> 0:55:19,93
So part of what
we find is people,


1493
0:55:19,93 --> 0:55:22,3
depending on your introversion
or your extroversion,


1494
0:55:22,3 --> 0:55:25,25
you can have lots of friends or
small friends, deep or broad,


1495
0:55:25,25 --> 0:55:28,72
and what we found is that
it really is how you see it,


1496
0:55:28,72 --> 0:55:31,44
how you see those interactions.


1497
0:55:31,44 --> 0:55:34,459
Do you see them as only
weak ties, in which case


1498
0:55:34,459 --> 0:55:36,25
they don't actually
provide as much meaning


1499
0:55:36,25 --> 0:55:38,15
to you, in which case
you don't actually


1500
0:55:38,15 --> 0:55:40,3
feel sustained by that
social support network?


1501
0:55:40,3 --> 0:55:42,383
It's what we see with
social media a lot of times.


1502
0:55:42,383 --> 0:55:46,91
When people follow people on
Twitter or on any social media


1503
0:55:46,91 --> 0:55:49,15
platform, if they
follow people they


1504
0:55:49,15 --> 0:55:52,41
don't know they get no return
on their investment of time


1505
0:55:52,41 --> 0:55:54,377
in terms of social connection.


1506
0:55:54,377 --> 0:55:55,96
But if they follow
people that they're


1507
0:55:55,96 --> 0:55:57,92
friends from high school
and they see that they just


1508
0:55:57,92 --> 0:56:0,3
had a kid or they just got
a job and they actually


1509
0:56:0,3 --> 0:56:2,94
do see them at some point or
they do interact with them,


1510
0:56:2,94 --> 0:56:4,99
they have a depth of
their social knowledge


1511
0:56:4,99 --> 0:56:7,54
that deepens that relationship
and causes more meaning.


1512
0:56:7,54 --> 0:56:9,869
So what I've been doing in
my life-- this sounds very


1513
0:56:9,869 --> 0:56:11,41
similar to what
you're experiencing--


1514
0:56:11,41 --> 0:56:14,24
is I try to reconnect with
some of those people in very


1515
0:56:14,24 --> 0:56:17,7
short bursts but
in meaningful ways.


1516
0:56:17,7 --> 0:56:19,17
And one of the habits
that I have people


1517
0:56:19,17 --> 0:56:21,21
do at these companies
is every day


1518
0:56:21,21 --> 0:56:23,83
when you get into work write
a two-minute email praising


1519
0:56:23,83 --> 0:56:26,19
or thanking or reconnecting
with one person.


1520
0:56:26,19 --> 0:56:26,69
That's it.


1521
0:56:26,69 --> 0:56:28,76
Two minutes maximum,
so it's super short.


1522
0:56:28,76 --> 0:56:31,16
It's two or three sentences.


1523
0:56:31,16 --> 0:56:31,709
Try it today.


1524
0:56:31,709 --> 0:56:33,25
Just connect with
one of those people


1525
0:56:33,25 --> 0:56:36,75
you feel like is outside
of that career sphere.


1526
0:56:36,75 --> 0:56:37,7
And if you do it for
three days, you'll


1527
0:56:37,7 --> 0:56:39,28
literally become addicted
to it, because you're


1528
0:56:39,28 --> 0:56:41,696
going to spend all day long
thinking about how amazing you


1529
0:56:41,696 --> 0:56:43,446
were for writing that email.


1530
0:56:43,446 --> 0:56:45,3
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]


1531
0:56:45,3 --> 0:56:47,78
SHAWN ACHOR: But what happens
is 21 days later as you've


1532
0:56:47,78 --> 0:56:50,3
reconnected to those people,
your brain realizes, wow,


1533
0:56:50,3 --> 0:56:52,53
I have incredibly
robust social support.


1534
0:56:52,53 --> 0:56:56,41
I saw some of you this morning
that I hadn't seen from my time


1535
0:56:56,41 --> 0:56:57,86
at Harvard, and
it's so exciting.


1536
0:56:57,86 --> 0:57:0,67
I haven't seen you in so
long, and it's so exciting


1537
0:57:0,67 --> 0:57:2,85
to have those opportunities.


1538
0:57:2,85 --> 0:57:5,21
What we found is social
support is the greatest


1539
0:57:5,21 --> 0:57:7,41
predictor of long-term
happiness we have.


1540
0:57:7,41 --> 0:57:11,8
So instead of
fleeing from negative


1541
0:57:11,8 --> 0:57:14,8
or only investing in our sphere,
if we can find just small ways


1542
0:57:14,8 --> 0:57:18,22
to increase and deepen
that social connection,


1543
0:57:18,22 --> 0:57:20,23
we've found it's the greatest
predictor of happiness.


1544
0:57:20,23 --> 0:57:21,605
At Columbia, they
found that if I


1545
0:57:21,605 --> 0:57:24,532
know the collective IQ on a team
and the years of experience,


1546
0:57:24,532 --> 0:57:26,24
neither of those are
as predictive as how


1547
0:57:26,24 --> 0:57:28,69
tight the team feels, so
we know it's important.


1548
0:57:28,69 --> 0:57:31,33
But then the last part, my
favorite statistic right now,


1549
0:57:31,33 --> 0:57:34,72
which is actually by a guy
named Dr. House, which I think


1550
0:57:34,72 --> 0:57:39,16
is hilarious, he found
that the social connection


1551
0:57:39,16 --> 0:57:43,4
is as predictive of how long
you will live as obesity,


1552
0:57:43,4 --> 0:57:45,76
high blood pressure, or smoking.


1553
0:57:45,76 --> 0:57:47,57
We fight so hard
against the negative,


1554
0:57:47,57 --> 0:57:50,27
and we forget about how
powerful two minutes


1555
0:57:50,27 --> 0:57:52,18
of a positive
interaction could be.


1556
0:57:52,18 --> 0:57:54,31
So yeah, I feel the
exact same thing,


1557
0:57:54,31 --> 0:57:56,84
and I think it's how we
perceive those relationships


1558
0:57:56,84 --> 0:57:58,781
that, while they
might be temporary,


1559
0:57:58,781 --> 0:58:1,3
that doesn't take away the
meaning involved with them,


1560
0:58:1,3 --> 0:58:3,52
just as everything that
is temporary in life


1561
0:58:3,52 --> 0:58:5,572
is not destroyed of meaning.


1562
0:58:5,572 --> 0:58:6,78
This is from Buddhism, right?


1563
0:58:6,78 --> 0:58:9,524



1564
0:58:9,524 --> 0:58:11,19
While things are
temporary, that doesn't


1565
0:58:11,19 --> 0:58:12,25
mean that there's
not meaningful.


1566
0:58:12,25 --> 0:58:14,208
In fact, that can actually
increase the meaning


1567
0:58:14,208 --> 0:58:17,194
of those short times that
we have with those people.

research out there more.

0:58:32,28 --> 0:58:36,36

had an adviser who said that

SHAWN ACHOR: So
if there's any way


1585
0:58:49,22 --> 0:58:50,27
you can share this research.


1586
0:58:50,27 --> 0:58:52,15
I think the best way is
to tell people about it.


1587
0:58:52,15 --> 0:58:53,92
Tell people they're
not just their genes


1588
0:58:53,92 --> 0:58:54,795
or their environment.


1589
0:58:54,795 --> 0:58:56,71
But really the best
way is to show them.


1590
0:58:56,71 --> 0:58:58,36
Pick up a positive habit.


1591
0:58:58,36 --> 0:59:0,66
Get involved with
one of these programs


1592
0:59:0,66 --> 0:59:2,649
to create one of these
positive changes.

is that it ripples out

0:59:7,16 --> 0:59:7,98
Real quick story.


1596
0:59:7,98 --> 0:59:11,769
I was working with a CEO
of a fast food company.


1597
0:59:11,769 --> 0:59:14,6
He sold his company for
hundreds of millions of dollars


1598
0:59:14,6 --> 0:59:15,14
and had a breakdown.


1599
0:59:15,14 --> 0:59:16,59
He made millions of dollars.


1600
0:59:16,59 --> 0:59:19,87
But that night he went
on track with his wife


1601
0:59:19,87 --> 0:59:22,787
and start walking off some of
the weight that he had gained


1602
0:59:22,787 --> 0:59:25,12
and talking about things that
he was grateful for, doing


1603
0:59:25,12 --> 0:59:25,953
that positive habit.


1604
0:59:25,953 --> 0:59:28,292
It was so helpful that they
start doing it and telling


1605
0:59:28,292 --> 0:59:29,75
their kids that
they were doing it.


1606
0:59:29,75 --> 0:59:32,207
And they got a call from one
of their friend's parents


1607
0:59:32,207 --> 0:59:34,54
who said, did you hear what
happened at the summer party


1608
0:59:34,54 --> 0:59:35,51
for your daughter?


1609
0:59:35,51 --> 0:59:36,635
And they were like, oh, no.

0:59:36,635 --> 0:59:38,11
Was there drinking or boys?


1611
0:59:38,11 --> 0:59:42,426
And they said, no, she got
everyone in her friend group

to sit around and
talk about the things

that were going on at school.

don't wait for happiness off
