###12 it's proving citadel dominates the granada skyline
###18 it's great walls have thirty-seven gigantic towers
###22 and it took over a hundred and fifty years to fail
###28 but the alhambra is more than just a military strong
###32 it's a pleasure palaces

###64 in that thirteen century this tension city lived under muslim rule
###72 the point where the great granada plane rose to join the mountains of the sierra
###76 nevada
###77 godding over that junction
###79 is the magnificent fortress known
###81 as the alhambra
###84 it was intended to that site to make
###86 military statement
###88 said that it is the powerful
###90 it's not just a fortress
###92 it's suspect
###93 tucked in a network of policies
###95 each one different
###97 by a succession of salt
###99 across a hundred and fifty years each new ruler has development house because
###104 controller and you have to melt
###107 these promises is surrounded by an exquisite suite of darkness
###111 combined who
###112 risen from tunis fed by fresh mountain
###116 watched over
###117 via brooding fortress designed to intimidate
###122 yet for all its beautiful bravado
###124 the alhambra it's not too triumphalism monument
###127 it was born of fear
###131 twelve thirty eight eighteen
###134 the muslim world of being under attack from christian crusaders for over a
###138 century
###140 the five hundred year old muslim empire in spain
###143 we shrinking under pressure from the rising christine kingdoms in the north
###147 it's an old friend as the president aristede question
###150 south plains anti anything i think century's most definitely a period of
###154 diet crisis firmness limp out
###157 dr amira bentsen describes this turning point in the history of muslim spain
###164 they faced pressure test email
###167 and then add up on indecent part of what became staying
###171 the empire
###172 and it was in ny period if collapse that we see local lads
###177 like mohammed first an acid density beginning to combat anisha for
###181 themselves
###183 not much is known about muhammad it denies he had before he enters granada
###188 he was just one of the many minus sultans warren over the scraps of the
###192 fading muslim empire
###194 when cast steel advanced on his northern territories
###197 he headed south
###198 and took over granada under circumstances
###201 curtis shrouded in mystery
###203 easy opportunistic leave act
###206 an enterprising individual who's making best use of the political circumstances
###209 at the time two tries to cheer the any chance of very existence
###214 including renata
###217 once they're muhammad climbed a wooded slopes about granada
###221 in search of a location to build the fortress
###224 in which he could safely on his family and the nationals from kristina paris
###231 he heard of a force built up from thirty years and a half hour previous testing
###236 and climb to the hill to investigate
###242 before him the ancient arab casa lsac thomas a beacon hill
###246 framed by the mountains of the sierra nevada
###250 it was the perfect site for a fortress
###254 in his mind's eye he conceived grow before him
###259 muhammad had found his ideal location
###267 decide because he historical wasteful forties
###271 because is sucky
###273 nearly lost on the media fight don antonio audit went out
###277 isn't experts in the architecture of the alhambra
###280 he believes the chill griffey if the area
###283 is perfect for a stronghold
###285 unhindered back
###286 are desires he's of sierra nevada so
###289 no report in to dickey's will be fine
###295 muhammad instantly recognized the sites defensive possibilities
###299 she started to outline the citadel if his dreams
###303 the first step was to rebuild the existing fortress known as the outcomes
###307 of god
###308 into a stronghold large enough to support his troops
###312 this would goddess suite of palaces surrounded by luxurious gardens
###317 that would form a royal quarter
###318 on the northern side of the hill
###321 undecided township
###323 colder medina
###324 housing the hundreds of people needed to run this royal bastante
###330 encircling it would be a gigantic perimeter walls
###334 dotted with dot talents to fight off marauding attackers
###339 the first he needed to build the watchtower
###350 defensive towers would form an integral part of muhammad's concept for the
###354 alhambra
###356 the basic building block of each town it was a square chamber repeated at every
###360 level
###362 these chambers would be filled with faulted arches
###365 that led light flood through the interior spaces
###373 the first hour muhammad would build was the tolerated and i think that known as
###377 the watchtower by the locals
###380 this brooding giant was bigger than anything granada had seen before
###385 it sent a message to both muslim and christian alike
###392 it was a statement to the people off or not
###395 lasted realistic trying to say we can defend you
###399 but remember that we are you live
###401 and that we are powerful on that week dominates you as all subject
###407 service watchtower needed to be strong enough to hold off any attackers
###411 wild bill this constructed the rest of the alhambra
###415 for this to work
###416 muhammad wanted it positioned on the extreme weston tip of the should be
###419 cahill
###420 where it would act as the unka for his plans new fortress
###425 here it would be surrounded by steep slopes on three sides protecting it from
###429 attack
###430 as it dominated the granada plane
###435 constructing a huge tower on the precipice
###438 using nothing but primitive tools
###440 would not be easy for the builders
###443 but the solution to that problem they've right beneath their feet
###448 they were building that fortress on almost sheer drop
###452 great for defense
###453 and a gigantic gash in that steep slope reveals the amazing substance that made
###459 the alhambra possible
###461 beneath the tolerate eleven civil engineer at mcad investigates a seam of
###466 this red rock
###469 paula secrets to the construction of this place only
###472 is this material here
###473 it is the famous alhambra conglomerate
###475 an extra-special ai and sandanistas
###479 c_n_n_'s love it
###481 get it by some weight
###482 clapton's is the client
###485 starts getting sticky
###487 service material becomes moldable
###489 and they use this stuff
###491 to make that
###493 it gave the builders of ready-made source of materials onsite
###498 this sped up the construction timetable
###500 and kept them close to the fortress they were building
###503 it's kalo also gave the stronghold it's name
###507 the madina alhambra
###508 which means
###509 red city
###514 this amazing early cement allowed the builders to lay a strong concrete base
###519 for the great watchtower without having to quarry and transport huge amounts of
###524 stone
###526 thought there was a serious flaw in the bill
###528 his design
###530 the core of the tower was supported by tears of options
###534 the full weight of the building resting upon them
###537 halfway through construction
###539 the builders realized that the arches were not strong enough to take the mood
###544 muhammad's first hour could collapse in on itself at any minute as an extra
###549 means of support
###550 they filled in part of the basement to provide a solid foundation for the
###554 talent to rest on
###556 that hasty repairs
###558 failed to fix the problem
###560 muhammad's fortress was in danger
###563 falling down
###568 britain
###571 the alhambra sinning watchtower the story that i think that was in trouble
###576 passage builders began to erected supplementals it was clear that the
###580 lower levels were not strong enough to support them
###584 edmica explores to find out why
###587 uh... this area
###589 was misleading or for a national news
###592 who were brought here a series of options that he didn't believe he broke
###596 up
###597 is on his own shootings and vicinity
###602 you know this has nothing to do this when the structures working for women
###606 who happens to losses in revenue
###610 the structures in distress
###617 there is a
###619 although it here
###621 is very substantial structural crack
###624 roman war our problems what or waiting on the wall
###629 right away to the floor
###630 is incredible if you're in the hands on
###634 moral issues is that this for me
###637 this one here
###638 postpone the away from this one here lungs crack for the question is what
###644 post is for one more
###646 the weight of the tower was crushing the options that were holding it out pushing
###650 it out of shape and cracking its walls
###655 soledad when the spending cuts that they were
###658 isn't going to go up
###660 here your honor the arch
###662 and turned into a wall something that was also someone said
###666 muhammad's builders brick topped the options to provide the crucial support
###670 needed but the interior of the talent no longer or any resemblance to its
###674 original design
###676 the sultans vision of auction spaces with a varied into play of light and
###680 shadow
###681 has vanished entirely
###684 in its place is a brutal monument to the needs of the age
###690 those needs
###691 were defensive
###693 muhammad's great watchtower looks out over the plains of the sierra nevada
###698 with the distant hills of the kingdom on the horizon
###702 covered by martin city today
###704 the watchtower once looked out over the wind farm land
###708 gear it's ideally cited to form the heart of the great intelligence network
###713 that god's muhammad's kingdom
###715 and the sultan house in need of such a network
###719 by twelve forty five just seven years after he took over granada muhammad has
###724 already lost his northern territories to the christian advance and his army is
###729 too small to win them back
###733 this is not a man who is surviving on the basis of
###736 military might
###738 and those days are long gone he surviving on information
###742 and on his relationships
###744 as professor didi fairchild rock als and those
###747 the alhambra scanned tinued existence is dependent on the good intelligence
###753 needs information he needs to know when enemies are approaching
###756 and he needs to know what's going on to gather this information
###760 the installs a network of signal towers
###763 designed to warn him of the christian advance
###766 this network a fork lifts was known as talia asks
###771 they were part of a vast information gathering system etc dot it intelligence
###775 from people who passed through the area
###778 providing early warning of christian troop movements
###782 signals warning of impending attack would be transmitted from the top of the
###786 tower by means of special may replace
###790 all fun
###796 from there
###797 they race from talent to talent traveling into the kingdom towards the
###802 alhambra
###804 until ultimately they arrive on the roof of the alhambra swatched our whether a
###809 warm the sultan of impending attack
###813 in twelve forty six
###815 messages from his signal towers
###817 tell muhammad at the christian king fernando of castio has taken high-end
###822 sixty six kilometers north of granada
###825 it's a major blow
###828 muhammad realizes that he cannot stop the caste indian entrance
###832 he needs more time to complete his fortress
###837 he strikes a deal with fernando in return for guarantees of his own
###840 autonomy
###842 muhammad not only gives up and
###844 he helps fernando cc bill
###847 it's a clever move
###849 but it's also an admission of weakness
###852 lots of people were shocked eddie had in effect abandoned high-end
###857 the reason he kicked back with to protect the city of print not a he felt
###861 that this was that cost that had to be paid to protect the enclave he created
###866 muhammad knows the uneasy troops might break down at any moment he wants to
###871 ensure that he citadel
###873 is secure is quickly as possible
###876 to do that he must finish the outcomes about fortress which will house the
###880 troops guarding the alhambra
###883 the plan is to build a triangular consul conquered upon three towers
###889 from here
###890 a gate house in the back wall provides access to the rest of the alhambra
###894 have working with the naturally occurring alhambra conglomerate the
###898 builders use molds to arrest its three me two thick walls k thing about me
###903 conglomerate diseases that you can build
###906 and this war he shows exactly how they did it
###908 basically what you do is you build yourself a mold
###911 yes his big panels joined together by a series of timber polls and you can see
###915 where the polls would have gone here the compulsory that put it in the panels in
###920 tied in together and then you're throwing a conglomerate through the
###923 water
###924 and you're an all-white pounding it and forcing
###927 particles of the conglomerate together and really tight concrete light convicts
###932 they leave the letter dry
###933 then climb up onto it and repeat the process
###937 but the engineers know that there's a significant downsides to this method of
###941 construction with water and win the stuff gets blown away i'm what you're
###944 looking at here is that your edited surfaced out of the many years has lost
###948 its strength
###949 and to prevent that happening what they did
###952 was their plight at alignments and stock of which is what this finishes his
###957 sister's bicyclists and mix that would lying
###959 and a bit of water and applied like a plaster
###962 that's much much better than swart
###965 and in the job would be done
###968 in this way the walls and buildings that made up the outcomes about
###972 could be erected swiftly and efficiently
###974 under the defensive chateau victoria del evento
###980 looking down from this watchtower the ground plan of the buildings that once
###984 filled the outcast of dollars still visible
###988 this driving miniature township
###990 houses the troops that got the sultan
###992 and the people who look after them
###996 the central street in the heart of the aisle kassebaum past five warehouses
###1000 and thirteen private houses
###1003 tarry
###1005 kilns
###1006 store houses
###1007 and a bakery supply the populations needs
###1011 the out kassebaum he's tina with life
###1019 and rising above them all of the great defensive towers that overlooked the
###1024 fortress
###1030 sultan mohamed must've wandered through his stronghold and felt that his dennis
###1034 d could find in the pc kua
###1040 thought there was more to the alhambra than just a fortress because beyond the
###1045 elk as a pa p plans a suite of palaces
###1048 that will eventually how's the sultan and his family
###1051 along with gardens
###1052 and a mini township to support them
###1055 the alibi how population of not only easel continents family but of course
###1060 his followers
###1061 answer rents and gardens of large population that lived in that palace
###1067 so one can think of that happening intercity probably win as many as five
###1071 thousand people living there
###1074 in order to sustain this population
###1076 the alhambra is threaded with darkness
###1079 i'll call you know that all of us will love money regardless of the other
###1082 number are designed to recreate annoyances
###1086 don antonio mountain peak a has studied the landscape of the hour hambrecht
###1090 index
###1091 for him
###1092 the gardens have a dual purpose
###1095 suddenly sensed the sensation of being in that would be a similar space and at
###1100 the same time a pro to the states fundamental
###1103 before
###1106 so the gardens of the alhambra we designed for practicality as well as
###1110 pleasure
###1111 to grow food as well as flowers
###1116 there is just one problem
###1119 there is no source of freshwater on the sabhi ko
###1124 it's issue drawback for a stronghold expected to feed and water as many as
###1128 five thousand people
###1130 the nearest water source is the river that flows just to the north of the site
###1135 the case
###1135 has a severe drawback
###1138 cause if you've been here in the thirties century
###1140 revert dot i would've looked pretty much like it does today the small babbling
###1144 brook making its way through granada
###1146 the basic problem amit has
###1148 towards down here
###1150 an immediate out there
###1153 to make the alhambra viable
###1155 its builders must divert an entire river
###1158 up onto the mountain of mohammed
###1163 and
###1168 making a river float back onto the alhambra is issued challenge
###1172 but muhammad and his engineers must find a way to make it happen
###1177 because without it he cannot transform these new citadel
###1181 into a self-sufficient oases have gotten some farmland
###1185 he needs to carry gallons of water to the gardens he's planning
###1190 to do this
###1191 he missed threat the alhambra with irrigation channels
###1195 and this is not an easy task
###1201 it's easy to forget in the modern world how significant war stories
###1205 in the historic environment how difficult was to get hold of
###1209 cc imaginary community on tocqueville
###1212 and computer tomorrow for water
###1214 hundreds of feet above the water supplies most obvious
###1218 the local residents
###1221 confronted with its plaguing the obvious and clever thing we would use the there
###1225 what
###1226 to some point when it was actually above them
###1229 eleni energy of the river itself bring water to them
###1233 but there is no natural lake about the alhambra
###1237 so they create one
###1239 muhammad's engineers constructed down the path the alhambra
###1242 which will build up enough water pressure
###1245 to feed into the citadel
###1247 six kilometers from the alhambra dawn antonio has found the downs at the
###1252 engineers created
###1255 before but i'm a fan of hillary we find ourselves that israel battled exact
###1259 point for the first man seeking mohammed the first ordered the construction of
###1263 attempt to divert water from the figured that the other way
###1268 based and created reservoir system capable of providing enough water to
###1272 fill in olympic sized swimming pool
###1275 hand free five sec
###1276 to the alhambra popular
###1279 it's hard to believe that this was dot fi handle most eight hundred years ago
###1283 but the ny six martin concrete scheme
###1286 liza truly ancient design
###1289 d'amato what is he still has the same sign this letter to the
###1293 the only thing that has changed since the in metairie
###1296 every year who know me big time
###1301 there are two frontgate of that
###1304 one of the gates about what is the flow into the debate that often the opposite
###1308 side of the doubt
###1310 tell us what it into that it that way
###1314 water from this reservoir flows into a brick line to come out
###1318 known isn't perfect here
###1322 this ultimately feeds the alhambra
###1326 but diverting the river darrow is just the start of this mammoth project
###1330 the canal builders still have to overcome a major obstacle
###1338 polygamy
###1340 the reservoir sits in a valley between three hills
###1344 so in order to reach the alhambra
###1347 muhammad's engineers need to build a water channel six kilometers long
###1351 that winds through the hills above the fortress
###1355 this has to carry the equivalent of seven thousand olympic sized swimming
###1359 pools
###1359 everyday to support the alhambra is growing population
###1364 and will only work if it flows down hill
###1366 at a constant gradient
###1369 so how can this happen
###1370 when there's a hill in the way
###1374 this solution is approved one
###1376 instead of going over the high ground
###1378 they decide to go through it
###1381 the builders dega time about one meter wide and two meters high through the
###1386 hillside towards the alhambra
###1389 and the natural stability of the alhambra conglomerate
###1392 in shows that there's no danger of collapse
###1397 it must have taken the months to borrow a channel into the hill next to the
###1400 alhambra
###1401 known as the hen iran if it
###1404 but there is still one great problem that must be solved
###1408 the alhambra sits on a completely different hill
###1412 muhammad's engineers must find a way to get the water from one hill
###1416 to another
###1420 to get water from the hill of the henner arafat next to the alhambra
###1424 into the alhambra itself
###1426 muhammad's engineers need to cross a fifteen meet again that separates the
###1430 two hills
###1432 the solution
###1433 and packwood out
###1436 and this is where the water from the tarifa arise if the alhambra
###1440 comes across here
###1441 and in the old days it used to go across the us if you have a yahoo which was a
###1444 channel which took it all the way into the center of the alhambra
###1449 the icici every alan formed a lifeline for the alhambra sit it out
###1454 from here water flowed to every part of the alhambra
###1458 it provided fresh water for the populace
###1461 fed the multitude of water features in the darkness of the sultans
###1466 these cartons were designed to symbolize the kingdom of granada
###1470 over which the self mushrooms
###1475 the gardens had a practical function as well
###1479 they were designed
###1480 to create an oasis in the heat of the granada sound
###1484 islam originated in the bed sets in an environment where water was its premium
###1489 and the ability to provide warts and for how quartet
###1492 leading eight not to be something
###1495 at sixteen eighteen title kal
###1499 in fact it's more than desirable
###1501 it's of crucial importance
###1505 playing wants is very important but i wasn't affected
###1507 he needed to perform ritual conditions in one eighty standout humber at what
###1512 that is ready completely still
###1514 even when you have still pulls water is flowing into those schools
###1518 and filling out again
###1520 and it's very important in terms of ritual purity that whole waters of the
###1524 continues flowing
###1528 to keep the water pure
###1530 muhammad's engineers must create a system that will prevent sediment from
###1534 soaking up the channels
###1540 their ingenious solution can be found dotted all over the alhambra
###1545 shallow pool
###1546 that's designed to slow the watered down
###1549 searching the waters coming
###1550 zooming down the channel carrying all this and pieces
###1553 and comes to an area where its wide indeed
###1556 was slow slow it down
###1558 and uh... stilts and sends them to slow down for tomato
###1564 in this way
###1566 the water for the alhambra stockman's will be kept constantly fresh
###1573 too much water can be a fat thing
###1576 if the system over loads
###1578 it can back up
###1579 blocking the channel and stopping the water from flowing freely
###1583 to prevent this from happening
###1585 muhammad's engineers decide to install a safety valve
###1590 any excess water that might overload the icici ac
###1593 is funneled along the side channel
###1595 that diverts it into an overflow system built into the walls
###1602 and this is where it comes up
###1603 the war starts off opinion pam brown
###1606 comes down in the park
###1608 through they sell for
###1609 dumbest travel and joins up with the river borrowed it
###1614 the engineers may have been genius lee solved the problem of too much water
###1619 but not the problem of too little
###1621 and it soon became apparent that during dry seasons
###1624 the alhambra could exhaust its water supply
###1628 at the summit of the header aliphatic stands their solution to the problem
###1632 a massive set of russia flies
###1636 visa positioned on the high ground so that gravity can insure a constant flow
###1640 of water defeat the gardens
###1646 to get the water up to the stress of lies muhammad's engineers harness it
###1651 donkey to a mechanism of interlocking wooden gears
###1655 when it walks in a circle
###1656 it turns up horizontal we'll
###1659 this in turn rotate sick care attached to a water wheel
###1663 which dips a line of buckets into the ethic here below
###1666 and deposits the water into a reservoir above
###1671 in this way the alhambra zen ginny as we're able to realize muhammad stream
###1675 of an oasis of gotten surrounding the palace complex protected by his fortress
###1682 but muhammad himself will not seen his dream come to fruition we he dies in
###1689 twelve seventy three before his life's work is complete
###1705 behind him
###1706 he leaves one great project unfinished
###1714 the prime reason he has built a fortress here in the first place
###1718 the nazri palaces
###1730 this is the heart of the alhambra
###1734 in the one hundred years that followed muhammad even as he is dead
###1738 his successes completed the great perimeter wall that surrounds the
###1742 citadel
###1743 began to construct the palace complex the courthouse his dynasty
###1748 each palace is unique
###1750 build one after the other by a succession of sultans
###1755 each internet tended to want to feel the need house or at least renovate existing
###1759 passes to make that and mark
###1762 so you end up with a sequence of different buildings
###1765 gradually fill out the space intellectually create a whole network
###1770 palisades
###1771 we being
###1772 the alhambra complex itself
###1774 together they form one of the most impressive palace complex is still
###1778 standing in europe today
###1781 this is what the alhambra was designed to protect
###1786 but there is one particular palace designs not just to protect
###1790 but to intimidate
###1798 thirteen thirty three
###1800 a century after its foundation
###1802 yusuf the first comes to the throne of the alhambra
###1807 he inherits the mantle of sultan at a high point in granada is long-running
###1811 conflict with the caste indian christians
###1814 who occupy much of spain
###1816 iranian he said the fast in the annie fourteen centuries all the first
###1820 highpoint
###1821 off the kingdom
###1823 uses the fast allies that marini dynasty in north africa
###1827 and appears to be in quite a strong position vis-a-vis the christian
###1831 kingdoms
###1832 to the north
###1834 alongside his new allies the marines
###1837 yusuf launches an attack into custody in territory
###1840 trying to regain some of the land his forefathers have lost
###1845 however granada is ascendancy short lived
###1849 just seven years later king alfonso of cast steel defeats the muslims of the
###1854 battle of the river sound at all
###1856 forcing u since allies the marinis
###1858 to withdrawal from spain for good
###1861 this may explain why the last active use of strain
###1865 is to build a shoots defensive tala the biggest yet on the alhambra is north
###1870 wall
###1871 but already accommoda s
###1874 this massive tala stands forty five meters tall
###1879 it forms the centerpiece of the brand new palace
###1882 that use of decides to build
###1892 in order to shoe horn it into the new palestinian
###1896 usace architects have to extend an existing tower on the north wall
###1901 they shift the existing sentry walk for the north onto a new wall and extend the
###1906 tower another twelve meters out
###1910 but use of isn't thinking of defense
###1912 he's thinking of his image
###1915 his talent
###1916 is designed to make a statement
###1925 use of the first has just suffered a terrible defeat
###1929 he decides to build a monuments that will reinforce his power and involve
###1932 ability
###1933 in the eyes of his people
###1937 by building this tyler yusef stamps his authority in his kingdom
###1941 but yusuf isn't just trying to impress his own people
###1945 he wants to establish he's been from ability in the minds of his christian
###1949 enemies the great hall in the palace of the com artists is compensating for the
###1955 way for lack of of military strength
###1958 because he has to rely on political and diplomatic negotiations he needs very
###1963 impressive space in which to conduct those
###1967 thousands of tourists aruba wellness by the same sense of all that christian
###1971 ambassadors must have felt
###1973 when they came to me to sell
###1975 because the interior of the complex is designed to make an impression
###1982 this is uses grand palace
###1987 at its heart the glory that is the whole of the ambassadors
###1998 everything in this overwhelming room
###2000 is designed to impress
###2004 any visiting ambassador would have been struck by the sheer scale of the
###2008 alhambra
###2011 the entire edifice is calculated to convey an impression of supreme
###2014 invincibility
###2017 the complex stock homework contains repeated arabic inscriptions
###2021 in praise of allah
###2033 almost one my arm and that's right
###2036 which is there is no comparable thought can you see that repeated over and over
###2040 and over again
###2042 proceedings seventy five feet about
###2044 contains more than eight thousand individual pieces of cd word
###2049 painted to resemble
###2050 the seven happens of islam
###2053 victimized ally is
###2055 a microcosm of even if x and sultana can control it
###2059 he is in a sense in control of universe which is quite a bold statement intimate
###2066 he had made a central challenge the usace architects have to face
###2075 they had to impress any ambassador kim entered this room with the power and
###2079 presence of the south
###2082 to do that
###2083 they needed to focus all
###2084 all the attention in the room onto the sultans thrown in
###2088 it's a very striking manipulation of space to emphasize the fact that you set
###2093 the fast
###2094 is there enough importance and power and then he said to be in control of this
###2098 indent
###2100 to do this the alhambra stock index had one thing that could help them
###2105 mathematics
###2109 when the classical world collapsed the mathematical knowledge used to build the
###2113 great monuments of greece and rome was collected by muslim scholars
###2118 and passed down through the muslim houses of wisdom
###2121 at the time of the alhambra
###2123 l all of the learning company
###2125 and later the woman's
###2127 is incorporated into islamic mathematics
###2130 they don't reject it because it doesn't threaten their religion
###2133 so here we have this classical legacy of mathematics
###2137 that is not only and how did that then improved upon
###2142 span a muslim architect issues two units of measurement inherited from classical
###2146 architecture
###2147 called the russia sheet coder
###2150 it was about sixty two centimeters long than virtually all of the alhambra is
###2155 based on this unit of measurement
###2159 this late at the heart of the alhambra st sign
###2163 so to create a space that will overwhelm visitors with the importance of their
###2167 sultan
###2168 uses architect's design a ground plan
###2171 eighteen russia she koto square
###2175 they defied the room along its horizontal in diagonal axes
###2180 using strength
###2181 fame all count four ninety degree oxfam wall-to-wall
###2186 a straight line between the end points of the socks creates an off together
###2191 this allows them to create a larger square sitting diagonally across the
###2195 original
###2196 which marks the location of the central windows at the entrance
###2200 equal actual triangles drawn from the center of the walls create the perfectly
###2204 proportioned width of these windows
###2213 very intimidating experience to walk into the hall of the ambassador's and to
###2217 see the full time
###2218 position there
###2219 century man in that space
###2222 generate behind him hannah ran up on city
###2225 and nothing i thought all thought his territory
###2228 how it must have been very impressive enough that then calculated to
###2231 intimidate
###2233 for beating both on the inside and the outside
###2236 the tower seems to have done its job
###2239 no one dared to attack the alhambra while yusef was on the throne
###2244 in fact he sits down for
###2246 would come from a completely unexpected source
###2249 for with great beauty comes great pain
###2252 and before the alhambra ca truly fowler including geo one of the most traumatic
###2257 events in its history
###2263 nineteenth of october thirteen fifty four
###2266 more than a century after the alhambra sf ambition
###2269 use of the first is preparing for his daily press
###2274 as he does uh...
###2275 he is attacked by a deranged slave
###2281 capt
###2286 command and staff seemed to death
###2290 yusef was just thirty six years old
###2293 his death paves the way things and on the defense
###2297 to create what may become
###2299 the alhambra is greatest monument
###2302 just five years into his red
###2304 accord chin tries to assassinate the new south
###2310 muhammad flees from his own people
###2313 and seeks refuge with granada is oldest enemy
###2316 the christian king of castio
###2319 despite his nickname pedro the crew
###2322 helps muhammad win back his throne
###2325 petr cruel and how much effect really had a friendship with respect to some
###2329 extent instead
###2330 intellectual and artistic interests
###2333 one could imagine that the team and kate at had attending friendship beyond the
###2338 politics
###2339 of here and i think that just underlines the point that we shouldn't think of
###2343 christians and muslims is always at loggerheads
###2345 his friendship with mohammed will change the alhambra forever
###2350 like many spanish kings
###2352 pedro is profoundly impressed by the beauty of muslim architecture
###2357 so when he builds a new palace in seville
###2359 he models it on the muslim packing
###2364 and when my husband finally
###2365 is returned to the throne and goes back to granada
###2369 he spent several years in the company of another architectural
###2372 fan
###2374 discussing architecture any brings many ideas that were developed incidental
###2378 back-to-back on that with him this is very interesting because it means that
###2381 the building that we consider the high point of islamic architecture in spain
###2385 always adapt to a christian pallets insecure
###2392 when he returns to the alhambra
###2394 muhammad is determined to outdo petraeus masterpiece in seville
###2399 and his triumphant response will be an architectural tour defaults
###2404 with its magnificent courtyard in breathtaking ceilings
###2408 muhammad deficits palace who proved to be more beautiful
###2412 more sophisticated
###2413 and more accomplished than the muslim style masterpiece of his powerful
###2418 christian mister
###2428 under the reign of muhammad the fish
###2430 the age-old rivalry between vannatter and cast steel takes a radically
###2434 different costs
###2437 frank status friendship with picture of casting
###2440 military confrontation transforms
###2442 into an artistic competition
###2445 muhammad commissions the exquisite palace
###2447 and of course of the lions
###2449 which seeks to emulate in surpass the beauty of cadres palace in seville
###2455 surfaces
###2456 uh... different part thereof
###2458 more publicity otherwise
###2461 because the test influences so both islamic atleast ten architect at the
###2466 same time
###2468 the court of the lions
###2469 for many people is the high point of mastered architecture in the high point
###2474 of islamic architecture in spain
###2476 it is spatially complex
###2479 marie s refine and it brings it all together in one exquisite space
###2487 pia is the crown jewel of the alhambra
###2490 built according to a set of rectangles each related to the other
###2495 once again muhammad's architect issues geometry different effect
###2501 when we look at the facade what we see
###2504 pain bytes with used to form a school where
###2508 which defines the next level up then we take the diagonal on that score squeeze
###2514 through to the tickle the point the end of the diana hits the becomes the next
###2519 flow within do exactly the same in the dying from the school
###2523 so what you're getting is is the very precise relationship between one story
###2528 high in the next
###2529 in accordance with
###2530 recruits
###2533 elvis looks right to ask because why the greek architect has come down to us
###2538 defines our
###2539 sense of beauty nuclear group buildings and i feel right was because of
###2542 presenters
###2544 beautiful artefacts
###2546 despite these western influences
###2549 the palace of the lions remains a resolutely eastern building
###2555 let me say today we don't really see it as it was
###2559 before wondering
###2560 program the central balloting
###2563 were actually bumpin
###2566 the flower beds were in circled by the sounds of the sultans wives which
###2570 overlooked the central garden
###2572 you'd had people sitting around the edges of the court on costanzo pockets
###2577 picking
###2578 i'd just saying the talks appliances and shrubs and trees
###2582 these rooms contain the palaces most spectacular tranship
###2586 an exquisite form of decoration
###2588 known as more cut-outs
###2590 with absolutely unique to islam
###2593 it's hard to explain where comes from it's hard to even understand it when you
###2596 see it it is so gasoline it it confounds the senses
###2602 you have a sense of it is not wait there in that it's hard to leave and almost
###2606 seems to me is a senior cabinet because of the interplay
###2609 like to say all of these small price
###2612 like helen
###2615 and again
###2615 it's mathematics that creates this astounding intricacy
###2620 hasn't exactly on a trip to the patent
###2623 which uses triangles and rectangular blocks to create its effects
###2628 the variety of cuts in the past two work creates different geometrical shapes
###2633 cataracts
###2635 the uses set into the wall of the building with clay
###2638 ready for painting plaster work is very complex
###2642 not only because the constant play between solid and void but also it was
###2648 originally paid it it was bright red bright blue so would have been a very
###2652 vibrant scary
###2654 the painters use exotic pigments among them bluegrass you right
###2658 extracted from lancaster nasty line in afghanistan
###2662 which cost as much as cold
###2667 it's as if the walls of existence had been completely changed
###2671 because overhead is this vault
###2675 you cannot comprehend you actually cannot understand
###2679 spatial dimensions are
###2681 there is no explain out there that you can focus her eyes it is
###2686 an extraordinary sensory experience
###2696 this was to prove the high points for the muslim kingdom of granada
###2700 because a century after muhammad unpaved roads artistic alliance
###2704 but different kind of partnership
###2706 would signal the alhambra stand for
###2709 in fourteen sixty nine the christian kingdoms of cast steel and arrogant
###2714 unite under ferdinand and isabella
###2717 sick historic alliance creates the kingdom of spain
###2722 unmarked suv brutal new phasing
###2724 christian policy towards granada
###2730 this crusade
###2736 on new year's day fourteen ninety-two
###2739 after ten long years of war
###2741 granada
###2743 last muslim bastion in spain finally compete relates to the christians
###2749 among those in the spanish company witness the surrender
###2752 is a sea captain
###2754 seeking royal sponsorship for a voyage of discovery
###2757 to the new world
###2760 is christopher columbus
###2766 the alhambra is new catholic masters would soon stamp their own mark onto the
###2770 complex
###2772 in the center of the fortress
###2774 king carlos the faith began building a huge squad
###2777 palace
###2777 with a circular courtyard
###2780 it stands in marked contrast to the architecture of its nazri predecessor's
###2785 it l two mclean
###2787 nothing can detract
###2788 from fact explicit beauty
###2791 if one compares the alana
###2796 stone houses of europe
###2799 it's just another world entirely
###2803 no wonder they want the concord ma it was a absolutely beautiful and unlike
###2807 anything that existed in europe at that time
###2812 a fortress first
###2814 a pleasure palace second
###2816 and now a place of wonder for tourists from all over the world
###2821 the alhambra still stands today
###2823 as a testament to the genius and beauty
###2826 of muslim oxfam decide
