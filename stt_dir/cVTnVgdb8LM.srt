1
0:0:2,7 --> 0:0:5,767
I'm going to take us back
to World War II, where they


2
0:0:5,767 --> 0:0:9,834
had bombers crewed by a
whole group of men here.


3
0:0:9,834 --> 0:0:12,433
And of course these men
weren't all pilots--a lot


4
0:0:12,433 --> 0:0:14,633
of these men were
gunners on the airplane.


5
0:0:14,633 --> 0:0:17,967
And their job was to sit
behind these guns


6
0:0:17,967 --> 0:0:20,667
and protect the aircraft.


7
0:0:20,667 --> 0:0:25,7
They sat in these Plexiglas
turrets, and these turrets


8
0:0:25,7 --> 0:0:27,734
were scattered through
the airplane;


9
0:0:27,734 --> 0:0:29,7
you can see them
on the front here,


10
0:0:29,7 --> 0:0:32,266
and on the top, and the
back, and the side


11
0:0:32,266 --> 0:0:34,467
and down the bottom,
depending on the aircraft.


12
0:0:34,467 --> 0:0:38,66
And their job was to
protect the bomber from


13
0:0:38,66 --> 0:0:40,7
fighter aircraft attacking it.


14
0:0:40,7 --> 0:0:43,233
That's what
they did.


15
0:0:43,233 --> 0:0:45,7
And so these guns were
strategically placed on the


16
0:0:45,7 --> 0:0:49,166
airplane as a protection
for that aircraft.


17
0:0:49,166 --> 0:0:51,5
But it wasn't just for
that aircraft alone.


18
0:0:51,5 --> 0:0:54,567
What they would do was that
they would fly in formation.


19
0:0:54,567 --> 0:0:58,667
And one airplane's gunners
could also protect the other


20
0:0:58,667 --> 0:1:1,6
aircraft that was flying
along next to them.


21
0:1:1,6 --> 0:1:4,33
And so they would have these
very complex formations


22
0:1:4,33 --> 0:1:6,967
that they would fly in--
all to protect each other.


23
0:1:6,967 --> 0:1:10,233
And as they flew in
formation, they had strength;


24
0:1:10,233 --> 0:1:12,7
you could say there was
strength in their numbers.


25
0:1:12,7 --> 0:1:14,6
But there was also strength
in the way that they were


26
0:1:14,6 --> 0:1:17,767
fitted together in formation.


27
0:1:17,767 --> 0:1:22,867
Now, anyone flying alone
was a sitting duck.


28
0:1:22,867 --> 0:1:26,3
It was just like--well,
you're out there. Sorry.


29
0:1:26,3 --> 0:1:30,166
And sometimes when
we try to establish--


30
0:1:30,166 --> 0:1:32,867
you run into somebody and
you're trying to witness


31
0:1:32,867 --> 0:1:34,633
--they say, "Where do
you get this information?"


32
0:1:34,633 --> 0:1:37,133
"Well,from the Bible." "How
can I know the Bible is true?"


33
0:1:37,133 --> 0:1:40,3
Oh, we quickly grab this
Scripture 2 Timothy 3:16


34
0:1:40,3 --> 0:1:44,867
and we say, "All Scripture
is inspired by God."


35
0:1:44,867 --> 0:1:47,567
And we throw this little piece
of information out there;


36
0:1:47,567 --> 0:1:51,8
and it's like--bing!
Battle's won. Uh-uh.


37
0:1:51,8 --> 0:1:56,0
The guy comes back and says,
"Oh, Scripture? So, all


38
0:1:56,0 --> 0:1:58,6
"Scripture is inspired by
God. Well, I agree with


39
0:1:58,6 --> 0:2:6,367
"that--yeah. The Hindu
Gita, it's inspired by God too;


40
0:2:6,367 --> 0:2:9,6
"let me see, the
Quran, it's Scripture;


41
0:2:9,6 --> 0:2:12,0
"it's inspired by God.
Listen, while we're at it,


42
0:2:12,0 --> 0:2:13,6
"we might as well throw the
Book of Mormon and a few


43
0:2:13,6 --> 0:2:15,33
"other books that we
know about into that.


44
0:2:15,33 --> 0:2:17,633
"All these Scriptures that
different people hold sacred,


45
0:2:17,633 --> 0:2:18,9
"they're inspired by God, too.


46
0:2:18,9 --> 0:2:21,834
It says 'all Scripture,'
doesn't it?"


47
0:2:21,834 --> 0:2:23,867
And your sitting there
and thinking--whew!


48
0:2:23,867 --> 0:2:25,5
How did we get here?


49
0:2:25,5 --> 0:2:27,133
And then you try to
nail the word,


50
0:2:27,133 --> 0:2:29,533
"Well, no, no, no, no.
It means inspired."


51
0:2:29,533 --> 0:2:33,4
"Oh, yeah, I wrote a poem
the other day, and I just,


52
0:2:33,4 --> 0:2:38,7
"oh, I just felt so inspired;
it just flowed; it just came.


53
0:2:38,7 --> 0:2:41,0
That must be Scripture, too."


54
0:2:41,0 --> 0:2:43,33
And you think, oh,
how'd that happen?


55
0:2:43,33 --> 0:2:45,834
We're off on some
sort of rabbit trail.


56
0:2:45,834 --> 0:2:48,3
And then, oh, my! You
get to the word 'God'--


57
0:2:48,3 --> 0:2:51,767
and now who knows where
you are going to end up?


58
0:2:51,767 --> 0:2:54,5
And there in just one
little short sentence,


59
0:2:54,5 --> 0:2:56,33
not a whole verse, you
just feel like you


60
0:2:56,33 --> 0:2:57,934
kinda ran up against a wall.


61
0:2:57,934 --> 0:2:59,3
You know what you have?


62
0:2:59,3 --> 0:3:1,467
You have one little
piece of truth--


63
0:3:1,467 --> 0:3:4,0
flying by itself unprotected.


64
0:3:4,0 --> 0:3:6,4
It's true, it's powerful.


65
0:3:6,4 --> 0:3:10,2
It, indeed, even that little
bit alone, is very potent.


66
0:3:10,2 --> 0:3:14,5
But, the enemy comes
in there and envelopes it


67
0:3:14,5 --> 0:3:16,266
with its ameba there and
wraps itself around


68
0:3:16,266 --> 0:3:19,1
and shoots it down, and when
you are left; you think--


69
0:3:19,1 --> 0:3:22,934
"Oh, where am I supposed to--
where should I begin?"


70
0:3:22,934 --> 0:3:25,133
Well, we want to talk a
little bit about that.


71
0:3:25,133 --> 0:3:27,967
We want to talk about
flying truth in formation.


72
0:3:27,967 --> 0:3:30,867
And I just want
to start out by saying,


73
0:3:30,867 --> 0:3:32,967
that what I want to
present here is not


74
0:3:32,967 --> 0:3:36,2
because I'm sort of
scholar and I sat down


75
0:3:36,2 --> 0:3:38,533
with a long face and I looked
at the Scriptures for a


76
0:3:38,533 --> 0:3:41,233
while and studied it--all of a
sudden, "Oh, I see that!"


77
0:3:41,233 --> 0:3:43,266
The way I began
to see this was, as I was


78
0:3:43,266 --> 0:3:45,633
teaching individuals,
all of a sudden, I would


79
0:3:45,633 --> 0:3:48,567
see something come in
there and grab them.


80
0:3:48,567 --> 0:3:51,266
And I--wow, that's powerful!


81
0:3:51,266 --> 0:3:57,8
Oh, now I see why that's
in the Scripture that way!


82
0:3:57,8 --> 0:4:2,66
It would really have
quite an effect on them.


83
0:4:2,66 --> 0:4:5,8
Now, what I want to show you
here is actually a framework


84
0:4:5,8 --> 0:4:9,667
that is stuck together
in the Scriptures.


85
0:4:9,667 --> 0:4:15,166
And when we fly this together,
it's extremely potent.


86
0:4:15,166 --> 0:4:18,5
When we teach the way
that we're talking about,


87
0:4:18,5 --> 0:4:19,967
you're actually doing this.


88
0:4:19,967 --> 0:4:24,0
Now, when we teach, in a
sense, what we do, is we take


89
0:4:24,0 --> 0:4:26,367
a person--the individual
that is coming to us,


90
0:4:26,367 --> 0:4:29,367
the unbeliever--we take
their framework, and


91
0:4:29,367 --> 0:4:31,934
we have some little tricks of
the trade that we've learned.


92
0:4:31,934 --> 0:4:35,133
We take their framework and
we hang it up and we say,


93
0:4:35,133 --> 0:4:36,734
"We'll just let it
sit over there."


94
0:4:36,734 --> 0:4:39,834
And we teach them this
whole new framework.


95
0:4:39,834 --> 0:4:41,7
Now, there's ways that
we do that. For example,


96
0:4:41,7 --> 0:4:45,333
I was teaching a fellow;
he was a very sharp man.


97
0:4:45,333 --> 0:4:47,333
And as we were going
through the story, beginning


98
0:4:47,333 --> 0:4:49,367
with Creation and working
our way through the Fall


99
0:4:49,367 --> 0:4:52,166
of mankind, and then
eventually, we got to the story


100
0:4:52,166 --> 0:4:54,5
of Noah; and we're developing
it out a little bit--


101
0:4:54,5 --> 0:4:56,7
we just touch on these stories.


102
0:4:56,7 --> 0:4:58,467
He looks at me and says,


103
0:4:58,467 --> 0:5:2,33
"John, you don't
believe this, do you?"


104
0:5:2,33 --> 0:5:4,233
And this is the way
I answered it.


105
0:5:4,233 --> 0:5:9,3
I said, "Well...what I
believe is up to me,


106
0:5:9,3 --> 0:5:11,433
"and what you believe
is entirely up to you.


107
0:5:11,433 --> 0:5:15,0
"We're finding out what
the Bible says about itself.


108
0:5:15,0 --> 0:5:19,66
"And I guess my job is try to
present it as clearly as I can,


109
0:5:19,66 --> 0:5:21,2
"and your job as a
student is to say,


110
0:5:21,2 --> 0:5:22,767
"'I understand it' or
'I don't.'" I said,


111
0:5:22,767 --> 0:5:25,433
"The question here is not
whether I believe it or not,


112
0:5:25,433 --> 0:5:28,1
but the question is, 'Do
you understand it.'"


113
0:5:28,1 --> 0:5:30,1
He said, "Oh, yeah,
I understand it."


114
0:5:30,1 --> 0:5:32,1
I said, "Well,
then lets go on."


115
0:5:32,1 --> 0:5:34,7
And what I did there was I
took his framework and I


116
0:5:34,7 --> 0:5:36,7
kinda hung it up and
I said, "Let's just


117
0:5:36,7 --> 0:5:39,3
leave that there for a while."


118
0:5:39,3 --> 0:5:40,834
Later on, he said,


119
0:5:40,834 --> 0:5:42,767
"John, do you remember that
time where I kinda mocked


120
0:5:42,767 --> 0:5:45,4
you a little bit for the story
of Noah and that stuff?"


121
0:5:45,4 --> 0:5:47,834
I said,
"Yeah, I remember that."


122
0:5:47,834 --> 0:5:50,166
And he said, "You know, I
wasn't believing any of it


123
0:5:50,166 --> 0:5:52,9
"up to that point. To me, it
was just a bunch of myths


124
0:5:52,9 --> 0:5:56,6
and stories. I wasn't
believing any of it."


125
0:5:56,6 --> 0:6:0,967
But he said, "What happened…
as I went on, through the


126
0:6:0,967 --> 0:6:3,5
"story, I began to say,
'You know what?


127
0:6:3,5 --> 0:6:5,533
"'This just couldn't happen.


128
0:6:5,533 --> 0:6:8,567
This had to be planned
from the bottom up.'"


129
0:6:8,567 --> 0:6:10,9
And he said,
"I went back and believed


130
0:6:10,9 --> 0:6:13,834
all of this here that
I had rejected."


131
0:6:13,834 --> 0:6:15,8
Now what we're going to do
is, we're going to take a look


132
0:6:15,8 --> 0:6:19,3
at the different aspects in
God's Word that God has


133
0:6:19,3 --> 0:6:21,734
built right in there to the
architecture of His Word,


134
0:6:21,734 --> 0:6:24,1
that causes a person to come
to a point in saying,


135
0:6:24,1 --> 0:6:28,767
"This just couldn't happen.
This just couldn't happen."


136
0:6:28,767 --> 0:6:31,266
And where the veracity--the
truthfulness of God's Word--


137
0:6:31,266 --> 0:6:34,333
just comes through like an
extremely powerful hammer.


138
0:6:34,333 --> 0:6:38,166
And either a person out
of emotion has to just


139
0:6:38,166 --> 0:6:42,2
reject the Word of God, or
because he's a thinking


140
0:6:42,2 --> 0:6:46,1
person, he says, "You know,
it's gotta be true."


141
0:6:46,1 --> 0:6:48,266
But there's no such thing
as a thinking person


142
0:6:48,266 --> 0:6:50,333
looking at it and saying
intellectually,


143
0:6:50,333 --> 0:6:52,7
"This can't happen."


144
0:6:52,7 --> 0:6:54,633
No, he's got to do it as
an emotional response


145
0:6:54,633 --> 0:6:56,667
to the truth;
it's so powerful.


146
0:6:56,667 --> 0:6:58,767
Let's take a look at it.
First of all,


147
0:6:58,767 --> 0:7:1,934
the prophetic events in the
Scriptures verify the message.


148
0:7:1,934 --> 0:7:3,133
Now how does this work?


149
0:7:3,133 --> 0:7:5,9
I want to just take a look
at the books of Moses.


150
0:7:5,9 --> 0:7:8,567
If you were to take a look at
the lifespan of Moses here,


151
0:7:8,567 --> 0:7:11,8
Moses wrote what we
might want to call some


152
0:7:11,8 --> 0:7:14,333
'must-know' information.


153
0:7:14,333 --> 0:7:16,667
He wrote about the origin
of the universe


154
0:7:16,667 --> 0:7:18,5
--this is critical stuff.


155
0:7:18,5 --> 0:7:21,0
He wrote about the origin of
mankind, about the origin


156
0:7:21,0 --> 0:7:25,233
of evil and sin,
origin of death,


157
0:7:25,233 --> 0:7:28,8
how to escape sorrow,
the source of joy.


158
0:7:28,8 --> 0:7:30,4
He wrote about eternal life.


159
0:7:30,4 --> 0:7:33,533
And this is all critical
information that Moses


160
0:7:33,533 --> 0:7:36,8
either touched on or
developed out quite a bit--


161
0:7:36,8 --> 0:7:38,633
that is either what you
might want to call


162
0:7:38,633 --> 0:7:41,667
'must-know' information.


163
0:7:41,667 --> 0:7:45,9
And he recorded this in the
last third of his lifespan.


164
0:7:45,9 --> 0:7:49,33
And you find this information
in the books Genesis,


165
0:7:49,33 --> 0:7:51,433
Exodus--on through
to Deuteronomy.


166
0:7:51,433 --> 0:7:54,633
And as we look at this
information here,


167
0:7:54,633 --> 0:7:55,867
we can ask ourselves,


168
0:7:55,867 --> 0:7:58,667
"How do we know that
what Moses wrote was right?"


169
0:7:58,667 --> 0:8:1,1
I mean, back in those days
there, the people that lived


170
0:8:1,1 --> 0:8:4,133
in that 40 years of Moses
lifespan, that knew him--


171
0:8:4,133 --> 0:8:7,3
as they were seeing this
material written, they say,


172
0:8:7,3 --> 0:8:9,767
"Well, how do we
know this is right?


173
0:8:9,767 --> 0:8:14,7
"What is, what sort of
reality do we have here


174
0:8:14,7 --> 0:8:17,33
that can verify
this information?"


175
0:8:17,33 --> 0:8:19,867
Well, Moses not only wrote
'must-know' information,


176
0:8:19,867 --> 0:8:22,633
he also wrote
Prophetic information.


177
0:8:22,633 --> 0:8:26,767
And this has some really
severe consequences.


178
0:8:26,767 --> 0:8:30,467
Now listen to this--tell
you a little story here.


179
0:8:30,467 --> 0:8:32,934
I first used this in India
here a couple years ago.


180
0:8:32,934 --> 0:8:37,1
I said, What would happen if
somebody was to


181
0:8:37,1 --> 0:8:39,367
call a press conference?


182
0:8:39,367 --> 0:8:41,967
Now nobody knows this guy,
but he calls this press


183
0:8:41,967 --> 0:8:44,567
conference, and he says,
"Listen, I have some very


184
0:8:44,567 --> 0:8:46,133
"important information
I have to pass on.


185
0:8:46,133 --> 0:8:49,6
"What's going to happen
(now this is Friday)


186
0:8:49,6 --> 0:8:54,0
"what's going to happen is,
on Monday, the Ganges River


187
0:8:54,0 --> 0:8:56,6
is going to turn to blood."


188
0:8:56,6 --> 0:8:59,4
And you can see a little handful
of scattering, smattering


189
0:8:59,4 --> 0:9:1,4
of reporters sitting out
there, and they're write--


190
0:9:1,4 --> 0:9:4,133
"What? Say that again?"


191
0:9:4,133 --> 0:9:7,567
"The Ganges River is
going to turn to blood."


192
0:9:7,567 --> 0:9:11,633
"To blood?" "Yes,
that's what I said.…


193
0:9:11,633 --> 0:9:14,0
That's what you need
to write down."


194
0:9:14,0 --> 0:9:16,6
Well, if it even hit
the newspapers at all,


195
0:9:16,6 --> 0:9:18,9
you know the Saturday
edition--if it even got there


196
0:9:18,9 --> 0:9:21,433
at all--it probably got to page
forty, little column in the


197
0:9:21,433 --> 0:9:23,834
bottom, and it would say,
"Crazy man,"


198
0:9:23,834 --> 0:9:26,1
or "Kook says, 'Ganges river
is going to turn to blood.'"


199
0:9:26,1 --> 0:9:29,333
Well, what if on Monday,
the river actually did


200
0:9:29,333 --> 0:9:32,33
turn to blood? Whoa!


201
0:9:32,33 --> 0:9:35,934
Monday's afternoon edition
--bang--big letters:


202
0:9:35,934 --> 0:9:38,6
"Ganges turned to
blood, forecast by--"


203
0:9:38,6 --> 0:9:41,9
"What was that guy's name?
I didn't even get it down."


204
0:9:41,9 --> 0:9:45,2
It's crazy. But it
would be up there.


205
0:9:45,2 --> 0:9:48,66
And there'd be reprints of
that tiny little column--


206
0:9:48,66 --> 0:9:50,3
"Yep, we did actually say
that this man said that."


207
0:9:50,3 --> 0:9:51,867
Everybody would
be talking about it.


208
0:9:51,867 --> 0:9:54,1
You'd have scientists down
there sampling it, seeing if


209
0:9:54,1 --> 0:9:56,767
it's some sort of reversal
of the red tide.


210
0:9:56,767 --> 0:10:0,4
And political pundits
would be talking about
this--looking wise.


211
0:10:0,4 --> 0:10:2,266
And everybody would
be talking about this.


212
0:10:2,266 --> 0:10:4,166
And there would probably be
a lot of people saying,


213
0:10:4,166 --> 0:10:5,934
"That guy hit it lucky; it's
just some sort of weird


214
0:10:5,934 --> 0:10:8,9
phenomena that he was
going to come up with."


215
0:10:8,9 --> 0:10:12,7
Might be some guy trying to
sell it on Ebay, who knows?


216
0:10:12,7 --> 0:10:17,0
But, what if he called a
second press conference?


217
0:10:17,0 --> 0:10:19,8
That room would be
crowded, wouldn't it?


218
0:10:19,8 --> 0:10:21,934
It would, wouldn't it?
There'd be cameras running.


219
0:10:21,934 --> 0:10:23,7
There's CNN.
Everybody would be there.


220
0:10:23,7 --> 0:10:26,266
They'd all be wanting
to arrange to get him


221
0:10:26,266 --> 0:10:28,834
on their talk show and discuss
this. And let's say, he said,


222
0:10:28,834 --> 0:10:32,533
"Well, on Thursday this
country is going to be


223
0:10:32,533 --> 0:10:37,834
overrun with frogs--
overrun with frogs."


224
0:10:37,834 --> 0:10:40,667
Well, you could imagine the
next day, they'd be saying--


225
0:10:40,667 --> 0:10:44,0
scientists would be saying--
"Frogs don't breed this time


226
0:10:44,0 --> 0:10:46,533
"of year, and they
don't normally have--


227
0:10:46,533 --> 0:10:48,767
that's just ridiculous!"


228
0:10:48,767 --> 0:10:51,767
There would be all sorts
of pundits giving comments


229
0:10:51,767 --> 0:10:56,1
on this, but I can tell you
what-- on Wednesday night, about


230
0:10:56,1 --> 0:11:0,967
11:35, everyone would be
sitting there very, very quiet.


231
0:11:0,967 --> 0:11:3,867
The windows open,
listenting.


232
0:11:3,867 --> 0:11:9,867
11:50. 11:55. Midnight.


233
0:11:9,867 --> 0:11:13,367
Ribbit, ribbit.


234
0:11:13,367 --> 0:11:14,567
Whoa!


235
0:11:14,567 --> 0:11:18,734
And just this noise just
permeates the land as they


236
0:11:18,734 --> 0:11:22,8
all being to sing and croak.
Whoa, I mean, you can


237
0:11:22,8 --> 0:11:25,8
imagine the next morning--
this guy is being hauled in.


238
0:11:25,8 --> 0:11:29,4
The prime minister of the
country wanting to meet with


239
0:11:29,4 --> 0:11:33,467
him and discuss this. And it
would be big, big news.


240
0:11:33,467 --> 0:11:35,9
And if this guy then
said, "Well, listen,


241
0:11:35,9 --> 0:11:38,2
"just wanted you to get
the point here:


242
0:11:38,2 --> 0:11:42,433
"that there's a message
that a particular God


243
0:11:42,433 --> 0:11:44,667
"wants to pass
on to the world.


244
0:11:44,667 --> 0:11:48,6
"And he wants you to know
it's important--he has some


245
0:11:48,6 --> 0:11:51,433
"'must-know' information
that you need to know and


246
0:11:51,433 --> 0:11:54,1
"I've been kinda
appointed his messenger.


247
0:11:54,1 --> 0:12:0,567
And, oh, by the way,
next Friday--lice."


248
0:12:0,567 --> 0:12:3,233
You know what?


249
0:12:3,233 --> 0:12:6,66
Everybody would be
listening very carefully.


250
0:12:6,66 --> 0:12:8,1
And everybody
would be hanging on


251
0:12:8,1 --> 0:12:12,66
not only for the fact that he's
saying next Thursday's lice,


252
0:12:12,66 --> 0:12:15,0
but they would also want to know
this 'must-know' information.


253
0:12:15,0 --> 0:12:17,5
You know why?
Because all of a sudden,


254
0:12:17,5 --> 0:12:20,0
he has incredible credibility
in their eyes.


255
0:12:20,0 --> 0:12:24,3
And the Bible tells us this
happened, didn't it,


256
0:12:24,3 --> 0:12:26,867
to a man named Moses?


257
0:12:26,867 --> 0:12:29,233
And it says that God
exalted him in the eyes


258
0:12:29,233 --> 0:12:31,633
of the people; he was
like a god to Pharaoh.


259
0:12:31,633 --> 0:12:35,166
I mean, it's like, what
Moses said, the people


260
0:12:35,166 --> 0:12:37,133
just breathed it in
like pure oxygen.


261
0:12:37,133 --> 0:12:38,9
It had to be.


262
0:12:38,9 --> 0:12:41,4
And the way the
Scripture's design… it was


263
0:12:41,4 --> 0:12:44,4
this prophetic information was
linked together with the


264
0:12:44,4 --> 0:12:47,767
'must-know' information, and
it's inserted in such a way


265
0:12:47,767 --> 0:12:50,33
that you can't divide it.


266
0:12:50,33 --> 0:12:53,8
And Moses, all the way through
the last 40 years of his life,


267
0:12:53,8 --> 0:12:56,533
we see him saying, "God says
this is going to happen."


268
0:12:56,533 --> 0:12:57,8
And guess what? It happened.


269
0:12:57,8 --> 0:13:1,333
There was 100% accurate
fulfillment of those things


270
0:13:1,333 --> 0:13:3,367
that he said was
going to happen.


271
0:13:3,367 --> 0:13:5,2
It just went down that way.


272
0:13:5,2 --> 0:13:8,333
And so, the people during Moses'
lifespan, if they wanted


273
0:13:8,333 --> 0:13:11,3
to know how this 'must-know'
information was true,


274
0:13:11,3 --> 0:13:14,233
all they had to think is,
"Well, Moses said this


275
0:13:14,233 --> 0:13:15,767
other stuff was going to
happen and it happened


276
0:13:15,767 --> 0:13:20,66
just the way it is; well,
it's gotta be true."


277
0:13:20,66 --> 0:13:23,4
Now, that works for people
in Moses' lifespan,


278
0:13:23,4 --> 0:13:25,333
but what about now?


279
0:13:25,333 --> 0:13:28,633
Well, Moses didn't just give
prophecies during his life span.


280
0:13:28,633 --> 0:13:33,0
He also said things that were
going to happen after he died.


281
0:13:33,0 --> 0:13:35,767
And if we were to take his
lifespan and shrink it down--


282
0:13:35,767 --> 0:13:38,333
like this, into a box--and stick
it right at the end of our


283
0:13:38,333 --> 0:13:40,6
timeline there, and
extend our timeline down


284
0:13:40,6 --> 0:13:45,4
to 2006 AD, and look at
this, we'd see that, yes,


285
0:13:45,4 --> 0:13:48,333
Moses gave prophecies in that
last 40 years of his life;


286
0:13:48,333 --> 0:13:52,1
but he also talked
about issues and events


287
0:13:52,1 --> 0:13:55,533
that would happen right
down to this present day.


288
0:13:55,533 --> 0:13:59,233
And after Moses died, for
those people that were


289
0:13:59,233 --> 0:14:4,567
asking that question--"How do
we know that this is right?"--


290
0:14:4,567 --> 0:14:6,266
they would be able to just
look around and say,


291
0:14:6,266 --> 0:14:8,934
"Well, is it happening
the way that


292
0:14:8,934 --> 0:14:10,6
Moses said it
would happen?"


293
0:14:10,6 --> 0:14:12,166
Now Moses
said that after he died,


294
0:14:12,166 --> 0:14:14,533
the people would be
disobedient, remember that?


295
0:14:14,533 --> 0:14:17,333
And he said, "You're
stiff necked;


296
0:14:17,333 --> 0:14:19,5
you're going to
become disobedient."


297
0:14:19,5 --> 0:14:22,2
And people after would be able
to look around and say,


298
0:14:22,2 --> 0:14:24,767
"Have we done that?"


299
0:14:24,767 --> 0:14:27,3
We can read in the
book of Daniel.


300
0:14:27,3 --> 0:14:46,0
Look what Daniel said:


301
0:14:46,0 --> 0:14:50,0
Daniel was very conscious
that they had rebelled


302
0:14:50,0 --> 0:14:54,5
against the Lord. He labeled
it for what it was.


303
0:14:54,5 --> 0:14:58,934
Daniel was very conscious
of judgment


304
0:14:58,934 --> 0:15:0,567
being played out
on his life.


305
0:15:0,567 --> 0:15:3,166
And so as people of Daniel's
day looked around and said,


306
0:15:3,166 --> 0:15:5,4
"How do we know that this
information is right?


307
0:15:5,4 --> 0:15:8,6
'Well, we are doing exactly
what Moses said we


308
0:15:8,6 --> 0:15:10,567
"would do, we've
become disobedient;


309
0:15:10,567 --> 0:15:12,4
we've rebelled
against the Lord."


310
0:15:12,4 --> 0:15:14,133
Not only that, Moses had
said that because of that,


311
0:15:14,133 --> 0:15:16,9
they would suffer curses.


312
0:15:16,9 --> 0:15:21,633
Remember that? He wrote
that--Deuteronomy.


313
0:15:21,633 --> 0:15:24,2
And so the people would be
able to look around, and


314
0:15:24,2 --> 0:15:27,0
they would see that--"You
know what? Boy, just as


315
0:15:27,0 --> 0:15:28,7
Moses wrote, we're
suffering curses."


316
0:15:28,7 --> 0:15:31,133
Look what Daniel continued
on in his prayer and said:


317
0:15:31,133 --> 0:15:57,1
(This is a continuation
of what we just read.)


318
0:15:57,1 --> 0:16:1,266
The linkage was very clear
in their mind between what


319
0:16:1,266 --> 0:16:5,3
Moses had written and what they
were experiencing in their life.


320
0:16:5,3 --> 0:16:8,467
And so, when they
asked those questions:


321
0:16:8,467 --> 0:16:10,133
"How do we know this is
right?" Well, they could


322
0:16:10,133 --> 0:16:12,33
just look around and see
there's been 100%


323
0:16:12,33 --> 0:16:13,967
accurate fulfillment
of what Moses


324
0:16:13,967 --> 0:16:15,834
said would happen
after he died.


325
0:16:15,834 --> 0:16:17,3
We're living it.


326
0:16:17,3 --> 0:16:21,633
Moses also wrote about the
Messiah--that he would come.


327
0:16:21,633 --> 0:16:23,834
He wrote that the people
would be scattered.


328
0:16:23,834 --> 0:16:25,6
It's interesting
reading those chapters


329
0:16:25,6 --> 0:16:27,633
and reading Josephus
side by side.


330
0:16:27,633 --> 0:16:29,967
It's just incredible--
the detail that's in there.


331
0:16:29,967 --> 0:16:31,667
He wrote that the people
after they were scattered,


332
0:16:31,667 --> 0:16:33,433
they'd be persecuted;


333
0:16:33,433 --> 0:16:35,967
and then also that
they'd be regathered.


334
0:16:35,967 --> 0:16:38,533
And so down through the
centuries, as people would


335
0:16:38,533 --> 0:16:42,767
ask, "You know, how do we
know what Moses wrote here


336
0:16:42,767 --> 0:16:46,266
about the origin of the
universe, about the origin


337
0:16:46,266 --> 0:16:48,4
of mankind, about the
origin of evil and sin,


338
0:16:48,4 --> 0:16:50,533
origin of death, how
to escape sorrow,


339
0:16:50,533 --> 0:16:52,2
the source of joy,
eternal life--


340
0:16:52,2 --> 0:16:54,533
all this critical information,
how do we know it's right?"


341
0:16:54,533 --> 0:16:57,66
Well, all they needed to
do is look around


342
0:16:57,66 --> 0:16:59,133
and they would see what
Moses wrote was being


343
0:16:59,133 --> 0:17:1,834
fulfilled in their
very lifetime.


344
0:17:1,834 --> 0:17:4,133
And they could look back in
history--over a long span--and


345
0:17:4,133 --> 0:17:5,767
they could see, "Yeah,
it's just happened--


346
0:17:5,767 --> 0:17:7,166
the way it played out."


347
0:17:7,166 --> 0:17:9,867
And so, what was happening
there was that 'must-know'


348
0:17:9,867 --> 0:17:14,967
information was being
verified by prophetic events.


349
0:17:14,967 --> 0:17:17,66
And I think it's tragic that
we've come to a point


350
0:17:17,66 --> 0:17:21,667
in our church (I'm talking
about in a global sense),


351
0:17:21,667 --> 0:17:24,367
where people don't want
to talk about prophecy.


352
0:17:24,367 --> 0:17:27,533
You know it's divisive, so
we don't talk about it.


353
0:17:27,533 --> 0:17:31,66
We use little jokes: "I'm not
a 'a-mil,' or 'post-mil' or


354
0:17:31,66 --> 0:17:34,133
'pre-mil'; I'm a
'pan-mil'--it's all going
to pan out in the end."


355
0:17:34,133 --> 0:17:36,3
We do this sort of
thing, you know.


356
0:17:36,3 --> 0:17:38,834
But the thing is: what we're
doing is we're taking one of


357
0:17:38,834 --> 0:17:42,8
the very powerful pieces of
God's architecture in the


358
0:17:42,8 --> 0:17:45,967
Word of God and we're just
throwing it out the window.


359
0:17:45,967 --> 0:17:48,133
Now, I don't think we should
go around and just nail


360
0:17:48,133 --> 0:17:52,467
dates down and be hyper-
dogmatic about some of


361
0:17:52,467 --> 0:17:55,433
some of this stuff. Let's
leave it a little open here.


362
0:17:55,433 --> 0:17:56,9
But let's say we can
use words like,


363
0:17:56,9 --> 0:18:0,433
"It seems to be..."
"It looks like it might...."


364
0:18:0,433 --> 0:18:2,133
And if we disagree,
let's disagree without


365
0:18:2,133 --> 0:18:3,834
being disagreeable.


366
0:18:3,834 --> 0:18:7,5
But lets not stop talking
about prophecy in Scripture.


367
0:18:7,5 --> 0:18:11,233
I've read that 27% of
Scripture is prophecy--


368
0:18:11,233 --> 0:18:12,8
much of which has
been fulfilled.


369
0:18:12,8 --> 0:18:16,133
It's a very potent
airplane of truth


370
0:18:16,133 --> 0:18:19,5
that we want to have
flying in our formation.


371
0:18:19,5 --> 0:18:21,66
Let's go on.


372
0:18:21,66 --> 0:18:26,8
The types reveal and
anchor doctrines--


373
0:18:26,8 --> 0:18:29,133
types that we
find in Scripture.


374
0:18:29,133 --> 0:18:32,467
We're going to look at this area
of what it reveals first.


375
0:18:32,467 --> 0:18:34,667
And what I want us to do
is: I want us to start


376
0:18:34,667 --> 0:18:36,667
by looking at the Passover.


377
0:18:36,667 --> 0:18:40,3
And we know that
the Passover was--


378
0:18:40,3 --> 0:18:42,967
came as a result of
the tenth plague.


379
0:18:42,967 --> 0:18:45,66
Now here's the Israelites:
they're in Egypt;


380
0:18:45,66 --> 0:18:46,433
they've been in
bondage there;


381
0:18:46,433 --> 0:18:48,867
they're slaves
in hard labor.


382
0:18:48,867 --> 0:18:52,66
And God brings these
plagues along to cause


383
0:18:52,66 --> 0:18:58,9
the Pharaoh to release the
Israelites from Egypt.


384
0:18:58,9 --> 0:19:0,367
Now that's not the only reason.


385
0:19:0,367 --> 0:19:3,467
I think there's more there;
we don't have time to go there.


386
0:19:3,467 --> 0:19:7,567
He brought these plagues
along, and the tenth one


387
0:19:7,567 --> 0:19:10,6
was to be the death of the
firstborn, remember that?


388
0:19:10,6 --> 0:19:15,33
And…how many here
are the firstborns?


389
0:19:15,33 --> 0:19:17,0
Put up your hand.


390
0:19:17,0 --> 0:19:19,166
Now, when you heard these
instructions, if you were


391
0:19:19,166 --> 0:19:21,6
back then, you would have
listened very carefully.


392
0:19:21,6 --> 0:19:23,533
You'd be taking
notes. You'd say,


393
0:19:23,533 --> 0:19:27,133
"Hold it, Moses, slow down,
slow down, slow down."


394
0:19:27,133 --> 0:19:30,333
First of all, they
were to take a lamb.


395
0:19:30,333 --> 0:19:33,3
(We're not going to look at
the whole Passover.)


396
0:19:33,3 --> 0:19:35,934
Here's my lamb right here.
I know it's small,


397
0:19:35,934 --> 0:19:38,266
but it's cold in Canada,
and they don't grow big.


398
0:19:38,266 --> 0:19:40,4
So, here's my lamb.


399
0:19:40,4 --> 0:19:42,266
They were told
to take a lamb--


400
0:19:42,266 --> 0:19:44,133
and remember it
had to be a male.


401
0:19:44,133 --> 0:19:46,233
That was the gender--
it had to be a male.


402
0:19:46,233 --> 0:19:49,633
And then it was to be without
blemish--it couldn't have the


403
0:19:49,633 --> 0:19:51,533
wool falling out. It couldn't
have a broken leg


404
0:19:51,533 --> 0:19:53,66
or anything like that.


405
0:19:53,66 --> 0:19:55,433
They were to kill it at
the appointed day


406
0:19:55,433 --> 0:19:57,567
and the appointed hour--


407
0:19:57,567 --> 0:20:0,567
there was a time they
were to do this.


408
0:20:0,567 --> 0:20:3,567
Now think, this is kind
of a strange thing.


409
0:20:3,567 --> 0:20:5,867
Can you imagine the
instructions?


410
0:20:5,867 --> 0:20:7,767
I mean, this is to
prevent the death


411
0:20:7,767 --> 0:20:9,133
of the first-born child.


412
0:20:9,133 --> 0:20:10,467
Why didn't he just say,


413
0:20:10,467 --> 0:20:13,1
"Go and lay in bed
for the full day."?


414
0:20:13,1 --> 0:20:15,734
Why didn't he do that?


415
0:20:15,734 --> 0:20:17,7
No, we're getting
this very elaborate--


416
0:20:17,7 --> 0:20:19,533
and like I said, we're not
going to look at it all.


417
0:20:19,533 --> 0:20:21,834
This is what
they're to do here.


418
0:20:21,834 --> 0:20:24,3
And you're supposed
to kill it;


419
0:20:24,3 --> 0:20:25,633
and when you kill it,
shed its blood.


420
0:20:25,633 --> 0:20:28,4
Don't hit it over the head
with a club. You are to


421
0:20:28,4 --> 0:20:30,433
kill it in such a way that
you shed its blood; and


422
0:20:30,433 --> 0:20:32,7
then you are to take its
blood and you're to apply


423
0:20:32,7 --> 0:20:35,166
it to the doorposts and
the lintel of the house.


424
0:20:35,166 --> 0:20:39,6
So we see this animal to
be killed, and the blood


425
0:20:39,6 --> 0:20:42,4
is to be put on--can
you see it over there?


426
0:20:42,4 --> 0:20:43,934
It's to be put on
the door posts


427
0:20:43,934 --> 0:20:46,7
and the lintel
of the house.


428
0:20:46,7 --> 0:20:48,667
Now, that's what
they are to do.


429
0:20:48,667 --> 0:20:52,934
Then they're to stay in the
house: go inside the door,


430
0:20:52,934 --> 0:20:56,4
stay in the house, and
partake of the animal;


431
0:20:56,4 --> 0:20:58,734
and while they do this, don't
break any of its bones.


432
0:20:58,734 --> 0:21:3,166
Now, you think about that--
what a strange prescription


433
0:21:3,166 --> 0:21:7,266
of events to prevent the
death of the firstborn.


434
0:21:7,266 --> 0:21:9,867
What was going on here?


435
0:21:9,867 --> 0:21:12,867
What we were told--that
if they would do this,


436
0:21:12,867 --> 0:21:16,467
that when the death angel
came, he would pass over


437
0:21:16,467 --> 0:21:20,2
that house in judgment.
He would pass over it.


438
0:21:20,2 --> 0:21:22,533
Now, what was
that all about?


439
0:21:22,533 --> 0:21:27,166
Well, this was a picture;
it was an illustration.


440
0:21:27,166 --> 0:21:35,633
And what it was a
picture of was...


441
0:21:35,633 --> 0:21:38,667
The Passover was a
prophetic picture of


442
0:21:38,667 --> 0:21:39,934
something that was
going on here.


443
0:21:39,934 --> 0:21:41,233
Now, what was it?


444
0:21:41,233 --> 0:21:43,133
It was the picture of the
substitutionary work


445
0:21:43,133 --> 0:21:45,233
of Jesus Christ.


446
0:21:45,233 --> 0:21:49,166
You see, just as they were
asked to take a lamb,


447
0:21:49,166 --> 0:21:52,7
the Scripture tells us that
John the Baptist, upon seeing


448
0:21:52,7 --> 0:21:55,5
Jesus, he says, "Look, the…


449
0:21:55,5 --> 0:21:58,767
Lamb of God that takes away
the sins of the world."


450
0:21:58,767 --> 0:22:1,934
Jesus was called
the Lamb of God.


451
0:22:1,934 --> 0:22:5,6
And just as the Passover
lamb had to a male,


452
0:22:5,6 --> 0:22:7,867
so Jesus was a man.


453
0:22:7,867 --> 0:22:10,533
And just as the Passover lamb
had to be without blemish,


454
0:22:10,533 --> 0:22:13,2
so Jesus was without sin.


455
0:22:13,2 --> 0:22:16,367
And just as the Passover lamb
was kept until the appointed


456
0:22:16,367 --> 0:22:18,3
time and even the
appointed hour,


457
0:22:18,3 --> 0:22:21,867
and then he died, so Jesus
died on the appointed day.


458
0:22:21,867 --> 0:22:24,133
I believe it was the Passover at
the appointed hour--it was


459
0:22:24,133 --> 0:22:27,533
3:00 in the afternoon, the
hour of the evening sacrifice.


460
0:22:27,533 --> 0:22:30,4
Right on schedule.


461
0:22:30,4 --> 0:22:35,834
And then just as the Passover
lamb was not to have its


462
0:22:35,834 --> 0:22:38,133
bones broken, when
Jesus was on the cross,


463
0:22:38,133 --> 0:22:40,7
they didn't break
his bones either.


464
0:22:40,7 --> 0:22:43,9
And just as by staying
inside the house, that was


465
0:22:43,9 --> 0:22:46,7
the only place they could
find safety, it's so only


466
0:22:46,7 --> 0:22:51,166
in Jesus Christ that we find
safety from eternal death.


467
0:22:51,166 --> 0:22:55,967
And just as back in those
days (in the days of Moses)


468
0:22:55,967 --> 0:22:58,0
where the Bible
says that if they did that,


469
0:22:58,0 --> 0:23:1,5
and by faith they
trusted the Lord YHWH,


470
0:23:1,5 --> 0:23:3,2
and believed that His words
were true, and they just


471
0:23:3,2 --> 0:23:5,767
put their confidence that--
yes, you know, maybe the


472
0:23:5,767 --> 0:23:7,834
first born was sitting there
and he's biting his nails,


473
0:23:7,834 --> 0:23:10,633
and he was worrying
away, but he didn't need


474
0:23:10,633 --> 0:23:14,667
to worry--because it was
all taken care of.


475
0:23:14,667 --> 0:23:18,0
When the death angel came,
he passed over that house.


476
0:23:18,0 --> 0:23:20,3
Why? Because judgment
had already come


477
0:23:20,3 --> 0:23:22,7
to rest on the lamb.


478
0:23:22,7 --> 0:23:25,867
In Egypt that night, there was
a death in every household.


479
0:23:25,867 --> 0:23:28,1
There was either the
death of the firstborn,


480
0:23:28,1 --> 0:23:31,333
or there was a death
of the lamb.


481
0:23:31,333 --> 0:23:34,9
But, if they had followed what
God had said, and by faith


482
0:23:34,9 --> 0:23:37,8
just trusted God and his
word, the Bible says that


483
0:23:37,8 --> 0:23:41,4
when the death angel came,
he passed over that house--


484
0:23:41,4 --> 0:23:43,166
wherever judgment
had already come


485
0:23:43,166 --> 0:23:46,2
to rest upon the lamb.


486
0:23:46,2 --> 0:23:47,633
And you see, the
same thing applies to us--


487
0:23:47,633 --> 0:23:50,433
just as the lamb died in
place of the first born,


488
0:23:50,433 --> 0:23:52,6
so the Bible tells us that
Jesus Christ died


489
0:23:52,6 --> 0:23:55,9
in our place: He
was our substitute.


490
0:23:55,9 --> 0:23:59,5
This is talking about the
substitionary work of Christ.


491
0:23:59,5 --> 0:24:2,834
And when God comes in
judgment to judge the world,


492
0:24:2,834 --> 0:24:6,433
His judgment will
pass over us. Why?


493
0:24:6,433 --> 0:24:12,2
Because it's already come
to rest on our Lamb.


494
0:24:12,2 --> 0:24:17,567
The types of Scripture reveal
to us certain doctrines,


495
0:24:17,567 --> 0:24:18,967
like the substitutionary
work of Christ.


496
0:24:18,967 --> 0:24:21,333
It really nails it down
in our mind.


497
0:24:21,333 --> 0:24:23,834
And the interesting thing is,
is that this is something


498
0:24:23,834 --> 0:24:25,5
unique to Scripture.


499
0:24:25,5 --> 0:24:27,9
It's also a form
of prophecy.


500
0:24:27,9 --> 0:24:32,33
And you only find it
in the Scriptures.


501
0:24:32,33 --> 0:24:36,133
You don't find it anywhere
else. You don't find it in the


502
0:24:36,133 --> 0:24:40,33
Quran; you don't find
it in any of the other
scriptures out there.


503
0:24:40,33 --> 0:24:44,6
You can't go to the Gita, or the
Vetas--no, it's not in those.


504
0:24:44,6 --> 0:24:47,7
This is something--the whole
idea of prophetic text


505
0:24:47,7 --> 0:24:50,767
is very, very unique
to the Bible.


506
0:24:50,767 --> 0:24:53,233
And it's extremely powerful.


507
0:24:53,233 --> 0:24:56,7
You know, as we use this in
our teaching, we find you


508
0:24:56,7 --> 0:25:1,1
see people sitting there;
they're just gripped by it.


509
0:25:1,1 --> 0:25:2,6
It's like a riddle.


510
0:25:2,6 --> 0:25:3,967
You know, when someone
gives you a riddle, you


511
0:25:3,967 --> 0:25:6,734
sit there and it's all like--
ah, man, I can't get this.


512
0:25:6,734 --> 0:25:10,166
And then all of a sudden, you
get it and it's like--bing!


513
0:25:10,166 --> 0:25:13,33
And it's like your eyes
pop open, the scales fall


514
0:25:13,33 --> 0:25:16,5
off and it's like--"Ahh!"
"Oh!" And then you're one


515
0:25:16,5 --> 0:25:18,467
of those guys sitting
in the room that's got
it, and all the rest--


516
0:25:18,467 --> 0:25:24,266
the rest are sitting there
and…As we do this, as we


517
0:25:24,266 --> 0:25:26,8
teach, we see people
sit there, and you can


518
0:25:26,8 --> 0:25:30,467
actually see in their
faces when it pops off.


519
0:25:30,467 --> 0:25:36,934
It just--on this last trip
to India, Singapore, and


520
0:25:36,934 --> 0:25:40,533
Korea--I remember when
I was teaching there in Korea.


521
0:25:40,533 --> 0:25:42,433
As I was getting to
this point, all of a sudden


522
0:25:42,433 --> 0:25:46,6
I tied the types together. This
lady started tapping her cheeks.


523
0:25:46,6 --> 0:25:49,166
And she was so excited,
she started going


524
0:25:49,166 --> 0:25:51,467
like this with her hands.
And then she looked down


525
0:25:51,467 --> 0:25:54,533
each side and she
put her hands down.


526
0:25:54,533 --> 0:25:57,4
But you could see
it right in her;


527
0:25:57,4 --> 0:26:0,266
you know, it just
bubbled out the top,


528
0:26:0,266 --> 0:26:6,3
because all of a sudden
they got it. It clicked.


529
0:26:6,3 --> 0:26:9,4
They know what it's all
about. They could see it--


530
0:26:9,4 --> 0:26:17,33
Jesus is my Passover Lamb;
He's my subtistute.


531
0:26:17,33 --> 0:26:20,33
Very very powerful stuff.
Very powerful prophecy.


532
0:26:20,33 --> 0:26:22,6
It's something that we
want to have flying


533
0:26:22,6 --> 0:26:26,367
in our armada of truth.


534
0:26:26,367 --> 0:26:29,934
Types not only reveal, but
they also anchor doctrines.


535
0:26:29,934 --> 0:26:31,4
And what do I
mean by that?


536
0:26:31,4 --> 0:26:35,3
Well, as an example, I'm
going to use accuracy


537
0:26:35,3 --> 0:26:38,633
in expression of
salvation truths--


538
0:26:38,633 --> 0:26:42,633
the accuracy in expression
of salvation truths.


539
0:26:42,633 --> 0:26:44,767
Now, stick with me here.


540
0:26:44,767 --> 0:26:48,2
I want to take you to
the tabernacle, and


541
0:26:48,2 --> 0:26:51,333
I want to specifically
look at the brazen altar.


542
0:26:51,333 --> 0:26:54,3
Now, if you're visually
challenged--and I find


543
0:26:54,3 --> 0:26:56,834
some people just don't relate
to something flat on a screen--


544
0:26:56,834 --> 0:26:59,166
here's a 3D model of the
tabernacle that you can


545
0:26:59,166 --> 0:27:2,333
get from us and it will really
help you in your teaching.


546
0:27:2,333 --> 0:27:5,166
We're looking at the
brazen altar right here.


547
0:27:5,166 --> 0:27:8,467
That's what's in question.
All right?


548
0:27:8,467 --> 0:27:10,9
And what they were told--and
we're just really jumping


549
0:27:10,9 --> 0:27:13,8
forward here--the people back
then (if you look in Leviticus),


550
0:27:13,8 --> 0:27:16,734
it says that they were
to bring an offering.


551
0:27:16,734 --> 0:27:18,4
It had to be from the
herd or the flock--


552
0:27:18,4 --> 0:27:22,3
you couldn't bring a crocodile
or a pig or something like


553
0:27:22,3 --> 0:27:23,9
that--it had to be from the
herd or the flock.


554
0:27:23,9 --> 0:27:26,166
It had to be a male; it had
to be without blemish.


555
0:27:26,166 --> 0:27:28,867
And what they had to do,
they had to bring this


556
0:27:28,867 --> 0:27:32,8
to the brazen altar--they were
going to make an offering there.


557
0:27:32,8 --> 0:27:36,0
I'll set this down
here for a moment.


558
0:27:36,0 --> 0:27:37,8
I want to take
this one here--


559
0:27:37,8 --> 0:27:40,9
it's not brazen--but you
got the idea, OK?


560
0:27:40,9 --> 0:27:43,133
And they were to bring
it to this altar.


561
0:27:43,133 --> 0:27:45,3
And what they were
to do is: they were


562
0:27:45,3 --> 0:27:49,4
to place their hand on the
head of that animal.


563
0:27:49,4 --> 0:27:52,166
Now, what was going on here
I believe, is that what


564
0:27:52,166 --> 0:27:53,633
the Bible communicates is
like the person is


565
0:27:53,633 --> 0:27:56,266
saying, "I deserve to die for
my sin; but I'm putting


566
0:27:56,266 --> 0:27:59,8
"faith that God's word,
what he's given here, is true.


567
0:27:59,8 --> 0:28:2,533
"And it's as though my sin
is being transferred


568
0:28:2,533 --> 0:28:4,667
from me to this animal.


569
0:28:4,667 --> 0:28:7,567
And when that happens, this
animal dies in my place."


570
0:28:7,567 --> 0:28:11,0
What we see here with this
hands on the head, we see


571
0:28:11,0 --> 0:28:15,4
that concept of substitution
being brought out here again.


572
0:28:15,4 --> 0:28:17,734
And it's a very powerful
picture that you


573
0:28:17,734 --> 0:28:20,266
can elaborate on
and deal with.


574
0:28:20,266 --> 0:28:24,7
Now the reason why this is
brought out this way,


575
0:28:24,7 --> 0:28:26,7
I believe, is because once
again, when we get to the


576
0:28:26,7 --> 0:28:32,667
New Testament, we see that…


577
0:28:32,667 --> 0:28:36,66
We're dealing with
a substitution issue here.


578
0:28:36,66 --> 0:28:39,533
And this altar picture
here--what we see going


579
0:28:39,533 --> 0:28:43,633
on here--is actually to help
us understand what went


580
0:28:43,633 --> 0:28:47,7
on the cross, when Jesus
Christ took our sin;


581
0:28:47,7 --> 0:28:50,133
it was transferred
from us on to him.


582
0:28:50,133 --> 0:28:53,233
He became our sin bearer,
and he died in our place.


583
0:28:53,233 --> 0:28:55,567
It's all about substitution.


584
0:28:55,567 --> 0:28:57,4
And I really believe that's the
core issue of the gospel--is


585
0:28:57,4 --> 0:29:0,834
substitution, substitutionary
work of Christ.


586
0:29:0,834 --> 0:29:5,433
Now, when we're expressing
salvation truths,


587
0:29:5,433 --> 0:29:8,5
we want to couch our
vocabulary in that sense;


588
0:29:8,5 --> 0:29:13,0
we want to use vocabulary
that communicates


589
0:29:13,0 --> 0:29:15,367
the substitutionary
work of Christ.


590
0:29:15,367 --> 0:29:17,9
But do we do that
all the time?


591
0:29:17,9 --> 0:29:26,66
Well, you know, what do you
do with something like this?


592
0:29:26,66 --> 0:29:28,834
Now, you're driving down
the road, an unbeliever;


593
0:29:28,834 --> 0:29:33,834
you're totally paganized,
and you see that.


594
0:29:33,834 --> 0:29:37,333
You've heard about this
Jesus guy a little bit.


595
0:29:37,333 --> 0:29:40,166
Is he a medical doctor?


596
0:29:40,166 --> 0:29:43,667
Is he into heart
transplants, or what?


597
0:29:43,667 --> 0:29:45,9
Now, we have a problem here.


598
0:29:45,9 --> 0:29:50,834
And you know, we use all sorts
of little phrases that codify


599
0:29:50,834 --> 0:29:53,333
what it means to
be a Christian.


600
0:29:53,333 --> 0:29:56,233
This is just one of
them, as you know.


601
0:29:56,233 --> 0:29:58,567
But, we have a problem,
because if we go back


602
0:29:58,567 --> 0:30:3,734
to our picture here, here we
are--we're standing here.


603
0:30:3,734 --> 0:30:5,266
And just pretend for a moment:


604
0:30:5,266 --> 0:30:7,9
I've brought my sacrifice
to the brazen altar.


605
0:30:7,9 --> 0:30:11,367
Here we are. I've come and
I'm just very weighed down


606
0:30:11,367 --> 0:30:13,967
with a consciousness
and how sinful I am.


607
0:30:13,967 --> 0:30:17,8
And I come, and I
look at that lamb.


608
0:30:17,8 --> 0:30:19,633
I put my hand on its
head and say,


609
0:30:19,633 --> 0:30:25,633
"I'd like to give
my heart to you."


610
0:30:25,633 --> 0:30:29,767
You know, the lamb looks up
and says, "Well, I'm


611
0:30:29,767 --> 0:30:35,367
not going to be around here
in a few minutes, you know."


612
0:30:35,367 --> 0:30:40,5
Or maybe I bring my sacrifice
and I come to the brazen altar.


613
0:30:40,5 --> 0:30:44,967
And I put my hand
on its head; and I look


614
0:30:44,967 --> 0:30:49,8
at the lamb, and say, "I'd
like to give you my heart,


615
0:30:49,8 --> 0:30:52,5
or I'd like to
give you my life."


616
0:30:52,5 --> 0:30:55,533
The lamb says, "That's very
nice, but once again, I'm not


617
0:30:55,533 --> 0:30:57,667
going to be around
in a few minutes."


618
0:30:57,667 --> 0:31:1,934
It doesn't fit the picture.
You get the idea?


619
0:31:1,934 --> 0:31:5,0
What we need to do is--
we need to run


620
0:31:5,0 --> 0:31:9,867
our terminology
past the altar.


621
0:31:9,867 --> 0:31:11,3
And we need to be sure
that when we do, that it


622
0:31:11,3 --> 0:31:14,2
honestly and sincerely
reflects what's going on here.


623
0:31:14,2 --> 0:31:17,33
And the fact is that I'm
a sinner, weighed down


624
0:31:17,33 --> 0:31:20,333
with the guilt and the weight
of sin. And I desperately


625
0:31:20,333 --> 0:31:24,734
need a substitute, and God has
provided it in Jesus Christ.


626
0:31:24,734 --> 0:31:27,33
We need to run our
terminology past there.


627
0:31:27,33 --> 0:31:29,6
Now, if we do that, we
won't be reflecting


628
0:31:29,6 --> 0:31:31,667
accurately what Jesus
Christ did on the cross,


629
0:31:31,667 --> 0:31:33,0
and we'll get into all
sorts of things.


630
0:31:33,0 --> 0:31:35,934
I really like the way Trevor
McIllwain expressed this;


631
0:31:35,934 --> 0:32:10,66
I just got to
give this to you.


632
0:32:10,66 --> 0:32:12,266
I just can't think of a
better way to say it.


633
0:32:12,266 --> 0:32:15,233
We got to make sure that
we're accurate in expression.


634
0:32:15,233 --> 0:32:17,33
And you know what?
The types that we


635
0:32:17,33 --> 0:32:21,567
find in Scripture help anchor
the way we express it.


636
0:32:21,567 --> 0:32:22,767
Here, look at another thing.


637
0:32:22,767 --> 0:32:24,7
It not only anchors
our expression,


638
0:32:24,7 --> 0:32:26,934
it anchors our content.


639
0:32:26,934 --> 0:32:28,7
You know, I believe that the
Scripture tells us that


640
0:32:28,7 --> 0:32:31,5
Jesus Christ--he died for sins
once for all--and that when


641
0:32:31,5 --> 0:32:33,467
we put our trust in Him, we
are secure in Christ;


642
0:32:33,467 --> 0:32:36,467
we can't lose our salvation.


643
0:32:36,467 --> 0:32:38,3
You come back to
this picture here--


644
0:32:38,3 --> 0:32:41,266
the idea of placing your
hands on the head there.


645
0:32:41,266 --> 0:32:43,433
It was the picture
of identification.


646
0:32:43,433 --> 0:32:46,567
You were identifying
with this substitute.


647
0:32:46,567 --> 0:32:49,433
It was though one's sins
was being transferred


648
0:32:49,433 --> 0:32:51,967
from yourself to
that substitute.


649
0:32:51,967 --> 0:32:53,133
That was the idea.


650
0:32:53,133 --> 0:32:56,3
It was your sins were
being imputed to it.


651
0:32:56,3 --> 0:32:59,0
But if you could lose
your salvation, now think


652
0:32:59,0 --> 0:33:2,734
for a moment here, if you
could lose your salvation,


653
0:33:2,734 --> 0:33:6,734
you would have to somehow
reverse this process.


654
0:33:6,734 --> 0:33:9,0
Now, I don't know
what that would look like,


655
0:33:9,0 --> 0:33:15,533
but I took a guess here.


656
0:33:15,533 --> 0:33:21,2
You don't see this in the
Scriptures. You don't.


657
0:33:21,2 --> 0:33:24,3
We could look at another
part of the tabernacle.


658
0:33:24,3 --> 0:33:27,66
You know, here's the veil,
that was between the


659
0:33:27,66 --> 0:33:30,2
Holy of Holies, where God's
presence symbolically


660
0:33:30,2 --> 0:33:32,633
was exhibited right
there over the top


661
0:33:32,633 --> 0:33:35,233
of that mercy seat--
between the two cherubim,


662
0:33:35,233 --> 0:33:41,467
and the Holy Place. And
that veil--it held man out.


663
0:33:41,467 --> 0:33:43,767
It protected God's holiness.


664
0:33:43,767 --> 0:33:46,6
But we see there that when
Jesus died on the cross,


665
0:33:46,6 --> 0:33:50,4
"It is finished," he bowed his
head, gave up his spirit.


666
0:33:50,4 --> 0:33:53,233
And it says in Luke that
the curtain of the temple


667
0:33:53,233 --> 0:33:55,6
was torn in two
from top to bottom.


668
0:33:55,6 --> 0:33:59,5
And Hebrews explains that what
that was: that was the picture


669
0:33:59,5 --> 0:34:2,3
of the body of the Lord
Jesus Christ being torn


670
0:34:2,3 --> 0:34:5,333
for you and me, so that a
way could be open for us


671
0:34:5,333 --> 0:34:7,934
to enter through that curtain
right into God's presence.


672
0:34:7,934 --> 0:34:10,367
It's an incredibly potent,
powerful picture.


673
0:34:10,367 --> 0:34:12,1
You know, I remember
when I was working


674
0:34:12,1 --> 0:34:13,834
with New Tribes Mission--
this happened a number


675
0:34:13,834 --> 0:34:14,967
of years ago when
my son was just


676
0:34:14,967 --> 0:34:18,33
five or six years of age--
just a little boy.


677
0:34:18,33 --> 0:34:21,166
And I was sitting in a
leadership conference;


678
0:34:21,166 --> 0:34:23,133
I was doing some teaching
there. And they had this


679
0:34:23,133 --> 0:34:25,567
elevated stool that I was
sitting on, so I was kinda


680
0:34:25,567 --> 0:34:27,667
looking down on all the
rest of the leaders there


681
0:34:27,667 --> 0:34:30,633
in this big conference
room--big oval table there,


682
0:34:30,633 --> 0:34:33,734
by the lectern and everything.
And we're sitting there and


683
0:34:33,734 --> 0:34:36,3
talking; all these older men
are sitting there--


684
0:34:36,3 --> 0:34:38,6
very important
individuals.


685
0:34:38,6 --> 0:34:41,967
All of a sudden, the door
bangs open--'Bang!'--and


686
0:34:41,967 --> 0:34:44,667
there stands my son with
a glass of water.


687
0:34:44,667 --> 0:34:47,9
And he just marches right in.
He walks by all these


688
0:34:47,9 --> 0:34:51,333
important older men, and
he walks right up to me


689
0:34:51,333 --> 0:34:55,266
and he holds up
this glass to me.


690
0:34:55,266 --> 0:34:57,834
Now, that's the picture here.
Because the reason was--


691
0:34:57,834 --> 0:35:1,533
why my son had no fear of
coming boldly into their


692
0:35:1,533 --> 0:35:4,6
presence, boldly into my
presence--was because I was


693
0:35:4,6 --> 0:35:9,1
his…father.


694
0:35:9,1 --> 0:35:11,1
And you see, that's what
we have pictured here.


695
0:35:11,1 --> 0:35:16,567
When that was torn, we has
now that have put our faith


696
0:35:16,567 --> 0:35:18,2
in what Jesus Christ
did on the cross,


697
0:35:18,2 --> 0:35:20,5
we enter boldly
into God's presence,


698
0:35:20,5 --> 0:35:25,934
because he's our…father.


699
0:35:25,934 --> 0:35:31,767
Ahh! Powerful, isn't it? It's
great stuff. Great stuff.


700
0:35:31,767 --> 0:35:35,533
But if we could lose
our salvation--


701
0:35:35,533 --> 0:35:38,667
if we could lose our
salvation--somehow


702
0:35:38,667 --> 0:35:42,0
we'd have to be kicked out
of the Holy of Holies,


703
0:35:42,0 --> 0:35:46,633
and then this would
have to be stitched back up.


704
0:35:46,633 --> 0:35:49,433
You know what? We
don't see that illustrated


705
0:35:49,433 --> 0:35:52,667
in Scripture anywhere.
We don't.


706
0:35:52,667 --> 0:35:56,33
And so what we find is that
not only do the types reveal


707
0:35:56,33 --> 0:35:59,2
doctrines in the Scriptures,
they help us understand the


708
0:35:59,2 --> 0:36:1,433
substitutionary work of
Christ, but they also


709
0:36:1,433 --> 0:36:2,834
anchor these doctrines
in such a way


710
0:36:2,834 --> 0:36:5,3
to protect us from
getting into error.


711
0:36:5,3 --> 0:36:7,266
They keep us from
shifting around;


712
0:36:7,266 --> 0:36:10,834
it's like cement when you
start studying those types--


713
0:36:10,834 --> 0:36:15,367
you are just locked right
down to what they are saying.


714
0:36:15,367 --> 0:36:17,266
And, of course, the Scripture
in the New Testament


715
0:36:17,266 --> 0:36:19,4
is so good at
just tying back in


716
0:36:19,4 --> 0:36:22,4
and revealing this is
exactly what was going on.


717
0:36:22,4 --> 0:36:25,166
Well, I want to look at
the third area, and that


718
0:36:25,166 --> 0:36:28,533
has to do with the fact that
stories define the words.


719
0:36:28,533 --> 0:36:31,6
Now, we're really
facing a crisis in our


720
0:36:31,6 --> 0:36:36,133
human language philosophy
here in the world,


721
0:36:36,133 --> 0:36:39,5
and that is in this whole area
that post-modernism--


722
0:36:39,5 --> 0:36:41,734
and I'm sure a lot of you have
studied post-modernism--


723
0:36:41,734 --> 0:36:43,2
you at least know
something about it.


724
0:36:43,2 --> 0:36:45,9
Post-moderns believe that
words no longer have…


725
0:36:45,9 --> 0:36:47,7
well, they've never had
meaning in their thinking.


726
0:36:47,7 --> 0:36:50,66
And that is because
word meaning changes.


727
0:36:50,66 --> 0:36:52,233
At one time, the word 'gay'
meant to be happy and


728
0:36:52,233 --> 0:36:53,734
cheerful, but now
it means to be…


729
0:36:53,734 --> 0:36:56,266
it has a lifestyle connotation.


730
0:36:56,266 --> 0:36:59,934
And so they say words--
the meanings shift.


731
0:36:59,934 --> 0:37:2,266
You can't write
something and expect it


732
0:37:2,266 --> 0:37:6,5
to mean the same thing
50 years later.


733
0:37:6,5 --> 0:37:10,33
Nor can one person
necessarily interpret another


734
0:37:10,33 --> 0:37:13,6
person's writing correctly,
because the meaning


735
0:37:13,6 --> 0:37:15,834
that is attached to words
by another person


736
0:37:15,834 --> 0:37:17,533
would be different
from the one written.


737
0:37:17,533 --> 0:37:20,934
And, there's an aspect
of truthfulness in there.


738
0:37:20,934 --> 0:37:25,2
Satan doesn't just
tell a 100% lie; he mixes


739
0:37:25,2 --> 0:37:28,533
truth in there; you know, he
really muddles it up for us.


740
0:37:28,533 --> 0:37:30,834
So post-moderns says that
words don't have meaning.


741
0:37:30,834 --> 0:37:33,8
So you can't really tell if
something's right or not


742
0:37:33,8 --> 0:37:36,266
because the meaning's
been shifted around.


743
0:37:36,266 --> 0:37:39,333
But the Bible actually uses
stories to define words.


744
0:37:39,333 --> 0:37:41,433
For example, if we were
to look at the word 'grace'


745
0:37:41,433 --> 0:37:44,5
in Scripture, this is
the word that we use;


746
0:37:44,5 --> 0:37:46,4
and we understand it
to a certain extent.


747
0:37:46,4 --> 0:37:49,867
But, we really--it's not
really strong in our minds.


748
0:37:49,867 --> 0:37:52,834
Especially, when you go
out into the paganized culture


749
0:37:52,834 --> 0:37:55,934
that we live in, the word
'grace' doesn't necessarily


750
0:37:55,934 --> 0:37:59,8
have a whole lot of depth
and meaning to it.


751
0:37:59,8 --> 0:38:1,9
But, you can
go into the Scriptures,


752
0:38:1,9 --> 0:38:3,633
and you can tell the story
about the children


753
0:38:3,633 --> 0:38:6,667
of Israel being out in the
wilderness, as God brought


754
0:38:6,667 --> 0:38:9,5
them out of slavery--
horrible slavery.


755
0:38:9,5 --> 0:38:11,734
He brought them out and
he was leading them


756
0:38:11,734 --> 0:38:14,667
to this land that he promised
to them. And as he took


757
0:38:14,667 --> 0:38:16,867
them there, he provided
them with food.


758
0:38:16,867 --> 0:38:19,734
He provided them water; he
provided them with clothes.


759
0:38:19,734 --> 0:38:21,934
They had shoes
that didn't wear out.


760
0:38:21,934 --> 0:38:25,5
He did all this for them, and,
I think, we would all agree


761
0:38:25,5 --> 0:38:28,133
that this was a wonderful
statement of love.


762
0:38:28,133 --> 0:38:30,734
Is that not right? It was.


763
0:38:30,734 --> 0:38:35,867
And the people were so
thankful and appreciative.


764
0:38:35,867 --> 0:38:40,6
No. They grumbled
and complained.


765
0:38:40,6 --> 0:38:46,633
But what you see there is
that God still showed love.


766
0:38:46,633 --> 0:38:48,6
He didn't say, "Oh,
you miserable crowd.


767
0:38:48,6 --> 0:38:50,633
"I'm going
to stop feeding you.


768
0:38:50,633 --> 0:38:54,6
"In fact, just expect to get
food on Tuesdays.


769
0:38:54,6 --> 0:38:55,7
"The rest of the week
you'll go hungry.


770
0:38:55,7 --> 0:38:58,433
"And you'll be
thankful for Tuesdays."


771
0:38:58,433 --> 0:39:1,633
No, he didn't say that.


772
0:39:1,633 --> 0:39:5,9
He didn't say, "Oh, everyone
--barefoot from now on.


773
0:39:5,9 --> 0:39:8,433
You'll be thankful
for those shoes."


774
0:39:8,433 --> 0:39:11,6
No, he just kept providing
them faithfully--


775
0:39:11,6 --> 0:39:14,33
day in and
day out for 40 years.


776
0:39:14,33 --> 0:39:15,6
He continued to
show them love.


777
0:39:15,6 --> 0:39:17,3
And you know what?
I think we would all agree,


778
0:39:17,3 --> 0:39:19,567
that hey, that was undeserved.


779
0:39:19,567 --> 0:39:22,2
He didn't have to do that.
And you know what?


780
0:39:22,2 --> 0:39:24,967
That's the meaning of 'grace'--
it's undeserved love.


781
0:39:24,967 --> 0:39:28,567
The story defines
the word.


782
0:39:28,567 --> 0:39:30,633
And now, when you think of
the word 'grace,' you think


783
0:39:30,633 --> 0:39:34,66
of that story and you
think, "Oh, wow! Boy,


784
0:39:34,66 --> 0:39:39,166
that's a neat God
that's like that."


785
0:39:39,166 --> 0:39:40,8
And we find that all the
way through Scripture.


786
0:39:40,8 --> 0:39:43,66
You know, where I come from--
Canada, we are running


787
0:39:43,66 --> 0:39:46,967
into issues having to do with
this matter of homosexuality.


788
0:39:46,967 --> 0:39:52,233
And in Canada, if you went
back 35-40 years ago,


789
0:39:52,233 --> 0:39:56,1
homosexuality was
considered a crime.


790
0:39:56,1 --> 0:40:0,266
It was considered a
perversion, a sin.


791
0:40:0,266 --> 0:40:5,567
And you could be arrested; you
could be imprisoned; you could


792
0:40:5,567 --> 0:40:9,33
face severe consequences
for having that lifestyle.


793
0:40:9,33 --> 0:40:12,967
But now, here we are in 2006,
and the last government


794
0:40:12,967 --> 0:40:16,133
brought in and said, "Hey, not
only is it OK, but we're going


795
0:40:16,133 --> 0:40:19,233
"to sanction it by
making it legal. You can
get a marriage license,


796
0:40:19,233 --> 0:40:21,734
"and you can become a married
couple, and all the benefits


797
0:40:21,734 --> 0:40:26,233
that go along with that can
be yours, as a homosexual."


798
0:40:26,233 --> 0:40:30,266
Now the word has been
redefined as something


799
0:40:30,266 --> 0:40:32,9
inappropriate to something
that is appropriate.


800
0:40:32,9 --> 0:40:35,66
But what does the Bible do?


801
0:40:35,66 --> 0:40:38,33
Well, the Bible says, "Hold
on, hold on, hold on here."


802
0:40:38,33 --> 0:40:40,367
What it does is that it gives
the definition for sexual


803
0:40:40,367 --> 0:40:43,166
immorality and perversion.
And what does it use?


804
0:40:43,166 --> 0:40:45,867
It uses a story--Sodom
and Gomorrah.


805
0:40:45,867 --> 0:40:49,834
And it says that these serve as
an example to those that are


806
0:40:49,834 --> 0:40:52,8
going to suffer the
punishment of eternal fire.


807
0:40:52,8 --> 0:40:56,4
It calls it sexual immorality
and perversion,


808
0:40:56,4 --> 0:40:58,533
and it anchors it with a story.
And the government of Canada


809
0:40:58,533 --> 0:41:0,333
may want to say,
"It's just fine,"


810
0:41:0,333 --> 0:41:2,6
but the Bible is going to go
on for eternity saying,


811
0:41:2,6 --> 0:41:5,5
"No, and here's a story to
illustrate what we mean by it."


812
0:41:5,5 --> 0:41:7,567
And you can't get
around the story.


813
0:41:7,567 --> 0:41:11,1
The story locks it down;
you can't change it.


814
0:41:11,1 --> 0:41:13,5
You can try to shift the
meaning of it, but you just


815
0:41:13,5 --> 0:41:16,767
can't do that, because the
story has locked the


816
0:41:16,767 --> 0:41:20,5
definition of the term in
place as defined as sin.


817
0:41:20,5 --> 0:41:21,934
And this is all
throughout Scripture.


818
0:41:21,934 --> 0:41:23,934
Now, I'm going
to throw out a word here,


819
0:41:23,934 --> 0:41:25,533
and I want you to respond
to me and tell me the


820
0:41:25,533 --> 0:41:27,633
story that defines
this word.


821
0:41:27,633 --> 0:41:31,467
Here's the word....What's the
story that defines it?


822
0:41:31,467 --> 0:41:33,533
Hmm?


823
0:41:33,533 --> 0:41:35,934
Abraham. There
you are. Yeah.


824
0:41:35,934 --> 0:41:37,1
Abraham defines it.


825
0:41:37,1 --> 0:41:39,5
So, here's the story
and it defines--


826
0:41:39,5 --> 0:41:41,5
gives the definition
for faith.


827
0:41:41,5 --> 0:41:44,667
Now, if you want to know
what faith is and what


828
0:41:44,667 --> 0:41:47,2
it isn't, then what
should you do?


829
0:41:47,2 --> 0:41:49,233
Well, I believe,
you need to go back and


830
0:41:49,233 --> 0:41:54,0
give a real serious study
to the life of Abraham.


831
0:41:54,0 --> 0:41:57,133
And you do that, and you
will find that when you do


832
0:41:57,133 --> 0:41:59,4
that, it will tell you just
what faith is like,


833
0:41:59,4 --> 0:42:3,133
and what it isn't. Now, I may
step on a few toes here in


834
0:42:3,133 --> 0:42:5,1
what I'm going to do here
in a moment; but I'm going


835
0:42:5,1 --> 0:42:6,934
to tell you something,
and when you do that--


836
0:42:6,934 --> 0:42:9,467
there's a real popular
thinking of faith out there


837
0:42:9,467 --> 0:42:11,133
that I don't think is
Scriptural--and what you


838
0:42:11,133 --> 0:42:15,9
won't find, you'll find
that faith is not a gift.


839
0:42:15,9 --> 0:42:19,3
There's no where in
Scripture where God (YHWH)


840
0:42:19,3 --> 0:42:23,1
gave Abraham a
gift of faith.


841
0:42:23,1 --> 0:42:24,6
It's just not there.


842
0:42:24,6 --> 0:42:26,9
Fact, you'll find the faith
that he exhibited is very


843
0:42:26,9 --> 0:42:28,867
much the sort of faith that
you're showing right now


844
0:42:28,867 --> 0:42:31,233
as you sit on these chairs--
hoping that whoever built


845
0:42:31,233 --> 0:42:33,567
this building did a good job
with the structural steel,


846
0:42:33,567 --> 0:42:36,467
and the roof is
going to stay up.


847
0:42:36,467 --> 0:42:40,5
The stories define the words.
And we can actually say


848
0:42:40,5 --> 0:42:42,934
that probably it helps
to stay out of error.


849
0:42:42,934 --> 0:42:45,333
Now, we need to look at those
stories and see how they


850
0:42:45,333 --> 0:42:47,133
define words, how they
are using it and then


851
0:42:47,133 --> 0:42:49,633
that needs to determine
our theology.


852
0:42:49,633 --> 0:42:51,333
Well, the fourth one--this
will be the last one


853
0:42:51,333 --> 0:42:54,1
that we'll look at--
I believe that the Bible


854
0:42:54,1 --> 0:42:56,333
uses word pictures to
anchor doctrines.


855
0:42:56,333 --> 0:42:58,533
Now, what do I mean
by word pictures?


856
0:42:58,533 --> 0:43:2,633
Well, an example of a word
picture would be redemption--


857
0:43:2,633 --> 0:43:5,266
the idea of being redeemed.


858
0:43:5,266 --> 0:43:8,233
We know that the idea of
being redeemed was a word


859
0:43:8,233 --> 0:43:11,233
that came out of the slave
market, remember that?


860
0:43:11,233 --> 0:43:14,467
It had the idea of a
slave that was chained.


861
0:43:14,467 --> 0:43:17,9
So the picture for us is that
we are individuals that


862
0:43:17,9 --> 0:43:22,433
were chained by sin in the
slave market of life.


863
0:43:22,433 --> 0:43:24,633
There we are. There's nothing
we could do to escape.


864
0:43:24,633 --> 0:43:26,333
We're humbled;
we're shamed;


865
0:43:26,333 --> 0:43:29,9
we're stuck.
There's nothing that we


866
0:43:29,9 --> 0:43:33,834
could do to save
ourselves, and yet the


867
0:43:33,834 --> 0:43:36,266
Bible says that Jesus Christ
came and he bought us.


868
0:43:36,266 --> 0:43:39,7
What did he buy us with?
His blood.


869
0:43:39,7 --> 0:43:41,867
He bought us with His blood.


870
0:43:41,867 --> 0:43:43,66
He took us out of the
slave market and he


871
0:43:43,66 --> 0:43:46,7
broke off those chains
and he set us free.


872
0:43:46,7 --> 0:43:49,133
That's the idea.
Redemption.


873
0:43:49,133 --> 0:43:50,8
And it's very,
very powerful--


874
0:43:50,8 --> 0:43:54,834
the whole idea of
this word picture.


875
0:43:54,834 --> 0:43:56,6
And remember, I
said I don't believe that


876
0:43:56,6 --> 0:43:59,8
you can lose your
salvation; but if you could,


877
0:43:59,8 --> 0:44:1,4
somehow in Scripture
you would need a


878
0:44:1,4 --> 0:44:5,133
word picture that says you
could be un-redeemed.


879
0:44:5,133 --> 0:44:7,7
We don't find that.
Or maybe de-redeemed.


880
0:44:7,7 --> 0:44:10,834
I'm not sure which way
you would go there.


881
0:44:10,834 --> 0:44:13,767
But then most people that
believe that, also believe that


882
0:44:13,767 --> 0:44:15,867
you could be re-redeemed.


883
0:44:15,867 --> 0:44:20,0
So what you would have is:
you'd have, here's your slave


884
0:44:20,0 --> 0:44:22,367
sitting there; he's all chained
and tied up. And then


885
0:44:22,367 --> 0:44:24,0
he gets re-deemed; so
he's happy. Then he's


886
0:44:24,0 --> 0:44:25,233
un-redeemed; then he's
re-redeemed; then he's a


887
0:44:25,233 --> 0:44:27,166
slave; then he's
re-redeemed, un-redeemed,


888
0:44:27,166 --> 0:44:29,433
then he's re-redeemed.


889
0:44:29,433 --> 0:44:33,4
You don't find anywhere
where there's word pictures


890
0:44:33,4 --> 0:44:36,33
in the Bible that
illustrate that.


891
0:44:36,33 --> 0:44:40,166
These word pictures really
anchor certain truths.


892
0:44:40,166 --> 0:44:42,867
What about the word 'justified'?


893
0:44:42,867 --> 0:44:46,233
Very, very powerful truth.


894
0:44:46,233 --> 0:44:48,834
I want to just use
a visual aid here


895
0:44:48,834 --> 0:44:51,567
that I think
will help there.


896
0:44:51,567 --> 0:44:55,233
When we teach on
the area of sin,


897
0:44:55,233 --> 0:44:58,133
we talk about sin
as being


898
0:44:58,133 --> 0:45:1,133
about our human dilemma--
if you want to call it.


899
0:45:1,133 --> 0:45:3,867
When Adam and Eve sinned in
the garden, a dilemma


900
0:45:3,867 --> 0:45:7,166
entered into the human
race. And this dilemma that


901
0:45:7,166 --> 0:45:10,133
we face is like a coin
that has two sides.


902
0:45:10,133 --> 0:45:12,467
You can't divide
these issues, really.


903
0:45:12,467 --> 0:45:16,667
The human dilemma on the
one side is that we face


904
0:45:16,667 --> 0:45:19,867
a sin consequence; we face
a penalty or a debt--


905
0:45:19,867 --> 0:45:21,333
whichever way you
want to phrase it--


906
0:45:21,333 --> 0:45:24,0
that we're
going to have to pay.


907
0:45:24,0 --> 0:45:26,66
Now, we not only endure
consequences in our


908
0:45:26,66 --> 0:45:29,133
lifetime with shame and
guilt and suffering and


909
0:45:29,133 --> 0:45:33,233
anger--all those things
that go along with that--


910
0:45:33,233 --> 0:45:37,533
but we also face death,
in a physical sense.


911
0:45:37,533 --> 0:45:39,667
This is all
consequences of sin.


912
0:45:39,667 --> 0:45:41,567
And then the Bible says
we face this thing called


913
0:45:41,567 --> 0:45:46,867
'the second death,' which is
an eternity in the lake of fire.


914
0:45:46,867 --> 0:45:50,4
And we're facing an
eternity of judgment.


915
0:45:50,4 --> 0:45:53,7
And so there's this horrible
consequence to our sin that


916
0:45:53,7 --> 0:45:57,433
we're facing. And as we look
at it, we see that there's just


917
0:45:57,433 --> 0:46:1,767
no way that we can escape
this on our own; we're stuck.


918
0:46:1,767 --> 0:46:3,6
And so we
have something here


919
0:46:3,6 --> 0:46:8,1
that we really don't want--
about our dilemma.


920
0:46:8,1 --> 0:46:10,7
But there's another side to
our dilemma and that is that


921
0:46:10,7 --> 0:46:12,734
there's something
that we need.


922
0:46:12,734 --> 0:46:15,266
If we're going to live in God's
presence for eternity,


923
0:46:15,266 --> 0:46:19,333
or even for briefly, we would
need perfection.


924
0:46:19,333 --> 0:46:21,2
'Without holiness no
man can see God.'


925
0:46:21,2 --> 0:46:24,734
There's--we would need to be
as perfect as he is perfect.


926
0:46:24,734 --> 0:46:26,867
We would have to have a
righteousness that is


927
0:46:26,867 --> 0:46:29,266
equal to his righteousness
just to be in his presence.


928
0:46:29,266 --> 0:46:34,367
And we don't have that.
So, we face this problem:


929
0:46:34,367 --> 0:46:38,6
How can I get this
that I don't have?


930
0:46:38,6 --> 0:46:42,8
And how can I get rid
of this that I have?


931
0:46:42,8 --> 0:46:46,133
You see, it's a two-
sides-of-the-coin dilemma


932
0:46:46,133 --> 0:46:48,533
that we face here.


933
0:46:48,533 --> 0:46:53,1
Now, what I believe we
can do here is: I believe


934
0:46:53,1 --> 0:46:57,767
we can illustrate this with
the doctrine of justification.


935
0:46:57,767 --> 0:47:0,5
Paul, can you come down
and help me here?


936
0:47:0,5 --> 0:47:4,33
And, Shawn, could you
give me a hand?


937
0:47:4,33 --> 0:47:9,133
If you guys could just
face me here. All right.


938
0:47:9,133 --> 0:47:12,7
I believe that what the
Scripture tells us is that when


939
0:47:12,7 --> 0:47:19,4
God first created mankind,
when we were first created…


940
0:47:19,4 --> 0:47:22,6
(Come forward as far
as you can, fellows.)


941
0:47:22,6 --> 0:47:24,767
When God first
created us, we were


942
0:47:24,767 --> 0:47:29,333
created innocent
of all sin. OK?


943
0:47:29,333 --> 0:47:31,867
We didn't know
anything about sin.


944
0:47:31,867 --> 0:47:35,0
All we knew was the
goodness of God.


945
0:47:35,0 --> 0:47:37,567
Back in that garden
of Eden, the Bible talks


946
0:47:37,567 --> 0:47:40,9
about how God was
man's best friend.


947
0:47:40,9 --> 0:47:43,934
He would come and he would
walk with man in the cool


948
0:47:43,934 --> 0:47:47,0
of the day. And it's
illustrated that there was


949
0:47:47,0 --> 0:47:51,567
a friendship, a communion
between God and man.


950
0:47:51,567 --> 0:47:56,66
There was a fellowship. But
then something happened.


951
0:47:56,66 --> 0:47:58,767
The Bible talks about how,
remember how Satan, in the


952
0:47:58,767 --> 0:48:1,767
form of a serpent,
came into the garden,


953
0:48:1,767 --> 0:48:6,6
and he questioned something
that God had said.


954
0:48:6,6 --> 0:48:10,333
God had said, "You see
that tree over there?


955
0:48:10,333 --> 0:48:12,467
"Don't eat of its fruit,


956
0:48:12,467 --> 0:48:15,8
because the day you eat
of it, you will die."


957
0:48:15,8 --> 0:48:19,1
Now, God in his love had
given a whole forest,


958
0:48:19,1 --> 0:48:22,3
a whole, a world of fruit
they could eat from;


959
0:48:22,3 --> 0:48:24,967
but he said, "Just that one;
don't eat of it."


960
0:48:24,967 --> 0:48:27,967
You might want to call it--it
was like a friendship test.


961
0:48:27,967 --> 0:48:32,333
Do you trust me? And every
day they didn't eat of it,


962
0:48:32,333 --> 0:48:34,834
it was like saying,
"Yeah, we do."


963
0:48:34,834 --> 0:48:36,7
But, when Satan came into
the garden, he said,


964
0:48:36,7 --> 0:48:39,33
"Did God really say that?


965
0:48:39,33 --> 0:48:41,6
"Ha! God knows that the
day you eat of it,


966
0:48:41,6 --> 0:48:44,1
why, you're going to be
an enlightened one."


967
0:48:44,1 --> 0:48:46,333
(That's by the way
what a Buddha is.)


968
0:48:46,333 --> 0:48:49,633
OK? "You're going
to be an enghtened one."


969
0:48:49,633 --> 0:48:54,834
Adam and Eve were faced
with this equation here--


970
0:48:54,834 --> 0:48:58,4
and the equation was this:
God said, "Don't eat of the tree


971
0:48:58,4 --> 0:49:3,33
because you will die." Satan
said, "Go ahead eat of it--


972
0:49:3,33 --> 0:49:7,3
the day you eat of it
you'll be enlightened;
you'll be like God."


973
0:49:7,3 --> 0:49:10,233
So they had to weigh
out in their mind--who's


974
0:49:10,233 --> 0:49:14,6
telling us the truth; who
is our real friend?


975
0:49:14,6 --> 0:49:17,233
And you know what?


976
0:49:17,233 --> 0:49:20,633
The Bible tells us that Adam
and Eve trusted a stranger.


977
0:49:20,633 --> 0:49:22,66
They trusted someone
that they didn't know


978
0:49:22,66 --> 0:49:25,1
his identity, and they
didn't know his history.


979
0:49:25,1 --> 0:49:27,967
They knew that God
was good.


980
0:49:27,967 --> 0:49:29,834
They knew his identity,
and they knew his


981
0:49:29,834 --> 0:49:32,233
history; but they
didn't trust him.


982
0:49:32,233 --> 0:49:34,834
They trusted a stranger
and they threw aside--


983
0:49:34,834 --> 0:49:37,467
they cast aside their
innocence. And when


984
0:49:37,467 --> 0:49:47,266
they did that, when they did
that, they took on a sin nature.


985
0:49:47,266 --> 0:49:54,7
They became sinful.


986
0:49:54,7 --> 0:49:59,433
(I knew there was something
difficult about sin, but…)


987
0:49:59,433 --> 0:50:3,734
OK. They took on
a sin nature.


988
0:50:3,734 --> 0:50:7,0
They rebelled against God;
they disobeyed him--


989
0:50:7,0 --> 0:50:11,266
they went his own way. They had
trusted Satan instead of God.


990
0:50:11,266 --> 0:50:13,433
And when that happened,
God set aside


991
0:50:13,433 --> 0:50:15,533
his mantle of
friendship.


992
0:50:15,533 --> 0:50:21,9
He set that aside, and it's
like he put on a cloak--


993
0:50:21,9 --> 0:50:30,0
the cloak of a pure,
perfect judge.


994
0:50:30,0 --> 0:50:33,1
Put on a cloak of a
pure, perfect judge.


995
0:50:33,1 --> 0:50:36,3
There was at that point--
what happened--there was a


996
0:50:36,3 --> 0:50:40,0
separation that occurred
between God and man,


997
0:50:40,0 --> 0:50:42,934
because sinful man could not
live in the presence


998
0:50:42,934 --> 0:50:44,967
of the pure, perfect God.


999
0:50:44,967 --> 0:50:50,66
{You need the gavel, right?
There you are.)


1000
0:50:50,66 --> 0:50:54,934
Now, as man stood in God's
courtroom, and as God


1001
0:50:54,934 --> 0:50:57,6
looked at man, he said,
"You know what?


1002
0:50:57,6 --> 0:51:2,0
"You are guilty of
breaking my law.


1003
0:51:2,0 --> 0:51:5,166
Even if it was just that
one rule, you are guilty."


1004
0:51:5,166 --> 0:51:7,967
And so, we find that God
declared man guilty


1005
0:51:7,967 --> 0:51:10,166
[crack!] in his presence.


1006
0:51:10,166 --> 0:51:12,133
OK, that's the verdict
that has come down.


1007
0:51:12,133 --> 0:51:15,266
Man is standing there, and
he's facing this two-sides-


1008
0:51:15,266 --> 0:51:16,734
of-the-same-coin dilemma.


1009
0:51:16,734 --> 0:51:19,2
He has this sin consequence
that he's facing because


1010
0:51:19,2 --> 0:51:20,834
he's a guilty sinner.
He's going to have


1011
0:51:20,834 --> 0:51:23,9
to pay this forever penalty--
this forever debt.


1012
0:51:23,9 --> 0:51:25,8
And he can't be in
God's presence,


1013
0:51:25,8 --> 0:51:27,567
he can't come back in his
presence, because he


1014
0:51:27,567 --> 0:51:29,533
doesn't have perfection--
he doesn't have that


1015
0:51:29,533 --> 0:51:31,433
righteousness that's equal
to God's righteousness.


1016
0:51:31,433 --> 0:51:36,934
He's in an awful dilemma. And
that's where man is stuck.


1017
0:51:36,934 --> 0:51:38,567
But the story
doesn't stop there.


1018
0:51:38,567 --> 0:51:43,266
What we see is that God
set aside his gavel.


1019
0:51:43,266 --> 0:51:47,3
He set aside his gavel, and he
came to earth as the pure,


1020
0:51:47,3 --> 0:51:56,834
perfect person--came to
earth as Jesus Christ.


1021
0:51:56,834 --> 0:52:1,133
So he came to earth.


1022
0:52:1,133 --> 0:52:6,33
OK, there you go.


1023
0:52:6,33 --> 0:52:7,967
Came to earth in the person
of Jesus Christ.


1024
0:52:7,967 --> 0:52:11,433
And for a period of time, for
30-plus years, he walked


1025
0:52:11,433 --> 0:52:14,333
on the face of the globe that
man could see the fact


1026
0:52:14,333 --> 0:52:18,0
that he was indeed the one
who was the Lamb of God--


1027
0:52:18,0 --> 0:52:20,1
that one without blemish.


1028
0:52:20,1 --> 0:52:21,934
The one that was entirely


1029
0:52:21,934 --> 0:52:25,233
complete and able to take
away the sin of the world.


1030
0:52:25,233 --> 0:52:28,33
He didn't just come to
live a good example for


1031
0:52:28,33 --> 0:52:30,7
man; he came for the
purpose of taking


1032
0:52:30,7 --> 0:52:35,367
man's sin off himself
and on himself.


1033
0:52:35,367 --> 0:52:39,1
And that's what he did--
when he went to the cross.


1034
0:52:39,1 --> 0:52:41,367
When he went to the
cross, what he did is:


1035
0:52:41,367 --> 0:52:44,834
he took the consequences
of sin upon himself.


1036
0:52:44,834 --> 0:52:47,266
He took care of this
side of the equation.


1037
0:52:47,266 --> 0:52:48,934
What he did on the
cross is: he became


1038
0:52:48,934 --> 0:52:51,8
the sin bearer and he paid
that eternal penalty,


1039
0:52:51,8 --> 0:52:54,567
that eternal debt. In one
moment in time, as an


1040
0:52:54,567 --> 0:52:57,867
infinite God, he took care
of it just like that.


1041
0:52:57,867 --> 0:53:0,9
And he was able to do
something on the cross


1042
0:53:0,9 --> 0:53:2,4
that we could have
never have done.


1043
0:53:2,4 --> 0:53:4,0
If we had tried to
pay for the debt,


1044
0:53:4,0 --> 0:53:6,1
we would have gone on for
eternity paying and paying


1045
0:53:6,1 --> 0:53:8,7
and paying and paying; but
in one moment in time,


1046
0:53:8,7 --> 0:53:11,3
he was able to pay that debt
and he said, "It is finished."


1047
0:53:11,3 --> 0:53:12,734
It's all done.


1048
0:53:12,734 --> 0:53:16,133
But that's not the
end of the story.


1049
0:53:16,133 --> 0:53:20,633
You see, he
took care of the sin


1050
0:53:20,633 --> 0:53:25,0
consequences on the cross.
But then as a result


1051
0:53:25,0 --> 0:53:27,266
of doing that, he could say
that, "If you believe that


1052
0:53:27,266 --> 0:53:29,367
"when I was dying on that
cross, I was taking care


1053
0:53:29,367 --> 0:53:32,633
of it for you, I have
something more for you."


1054
0:53:32,633 --> 0:53:34,9
Do you believe that Jesus
Christ died in your place?


1055
0:53:34,9 --> 0:53:37,4
You do. Well then, you
know what? God says that


1056
0:53:37,4 --> 0:53:40,66
if you believe that he
died in your place,


1057
0:53:40,66 --> 0:53:42,266
then he wants to
give you a gift.


1058
0:53:42,266 --> 0:53:45,533
He wants to clothe you
in his righteousness.


1059
0:53:45,533 --> 0:53:47,967
And now, when you stand
in God's courtroom,


1060
0:53:47,967 --> 0:53:51,66
and he lifts the gavel
to look at you,


1061
0:53:51,66 --> 0:53:54,867
he no longer sees
your sin; but he sees you


1062
0:53:54,867 --> 0:53:57,834
clothed in the
righteousness of Christ.


1063
0:53:57,834 --> 0:54:0,333
And because he's the
resurrected savior that's


1064
0:54:0,333 --> 0:54:3,66
come back to life, when he
stands there and looks at you,


1065
0:54:3,66 --> 0:54:5,7
he doesn't say, "I
declare you guilty";


1066
0:54:5,7 --> 0:54:9,1
rather, he says, "I declare
you righteous in my eyes."


1067
0:54:9,1 --> 0:54:13,0
And that is the meaning of
the word 'justified'--


1068
0:54:13,0 --> 0:54:17,667
[crack!] to be
declared righteous.


1069
0:54:17,667 --> 0:54:20,6
That's the concept
of justification.


1070
0:54:20,6 --> 0:54:22,834
Now, let me ask
you a question.


1071
0:54:22,834 --> 0:54:24,967
And this is what I do
with my students.


1072
0:54:24,967 --> 0:54:33,233
The devil shows up and he says,
"Hmmm. Well, I'll fix that.


1073
0:54:33,233 --> 0:54:36,7
I'll just tear this
righteousness off."


1074
0:54:36,7 --> 0:54:38,7
Could he do it?


1075
0:54:38,7 --> 0:54:43,8
The Bible tells
us this righteousness
comes from whom? God.


1076
0:54:43,8 --> 0:54:45,8
It has come from God.


1077
0:54:45,8 --> 0:54:48,233
The devil has no right
meddling with it.


1078
0:54:48,233 --> 0:54:51,0
It's something that's
been provided by him.


1079
0:54:51,0 --> 0:54:53,4
You can't tear it off.


1080
0:54:53,4 --> 0:54:56,3
I remember when I was teaching
this out in India here a couple


1081
0:54:56,3 --> 0:54:59,4
years ago--a young man,
his hands pop up


1082
0:54:59,4 --> 0:55:2,433
"Can Satan tear that off me?


1083
0:55:2,433 --> 0:55:4,567
Could somebody else
rip it off me?"


1084
0:55:4,567 --> 0:55:6,6
I said, "Well, God's clothed
you; he's put it there.


1085
0:55:6,6 --> 0:55:9,2
Who do you think would be
able to take it off?"


1086
0:55:9,2 --> 0:55:11,633
"Oh, only God could."


1087
0:55:11,633 --> 0:55:13,734
"Well, he says he's not
going to do that."


1088
0:55:13,734 --> 0:55:18,567
What he's done is, taken care
of the other side of the coin--


1089
0:55:18,567 --> 0:55:20,633
he's taking care of
the perfection side.


1090
0:55:20,633 --> 0:55:23,333
You are going to be able to
live in his presence for


1091
0:55:23,333 --> 0:55:26,166
eternity not because of
your righteousness,


1092
0:55:26,166 --> 0:55:29,6
but because he provided you
with his righteousness.


1093
0:55:29,6 --> 0:55:31,767
And now clothed in
his righteousness,


1094
0:55:31,767 --> 0:55:37,0
you are what we call
"In Him"--"In Christ."


1095
0:55:37,0 --> 0:55:41,2
He's taken care of all you
need to live with him.


1096
0:55:41,2 --> 0:55:46,9
You see, what this
does, it shows us that
when we are justified,


1097
0:55:46,9 --> 0:55:50,433
there's no such thing as
being un-justified--


1098
0:55:50,433 --> 0:55:53,33
or de-justified.


1099
0:55:53,33 --> 0:55:55,467
In which case, we'd have to
be able to be re-justified.


1100
0:55:55,467 --> 0:55:59,0
No, there's nothing
like that out there.


1101
0:55:59,0 --> 0:56:2,333
What it shows us is that when
we are provided with this,


1102
0:56:2,333 --> 0:56:6,5
by God from heaven,
and he declares us
righteous in his eyes,


1103
0:56:6,5 --> 0:56:8,233
then that's a final act.


1104
0:56:8,233 --> 0:56:10,9
And that's the word picture
we find in Scriptures.


1105
0:56:10,9 --> 0:56:12,734
It's very, very powerful.


1106
0:56:12,734 --> 0:56:18,133
Thanks, fellows.


1107
0:56:18,133 --> 0:56:22,7
As we take advantage of the
architecture of God's Word,


1108
0:56:22,7 --> 0:56:29,8
as we teach through the
Scriptures as we have outlined,


1109
0:56:29,8 --> 0:56:33,767
it's a very, in many ways, it's
a very condensed outline.


1110
0:56:33,767 --> 0:56:36,5
Some have said, "Oh, my,
my, that's a thick book.


1111
0:56:36,5 --> 0:56:38,133
I don't know if I could ever get
an unbeliever to read it."


1112
0:56:38,133 --> 0:56:41,166
Well, you know what? You'd
be amazed at how it works.


1113
0:56:41,166 --> 0:56:44,567
If you're reading it
just to yourself,


1114
0:56:44,567 --> 0:56:46,133
you can read it in about
eight hours.


1115
0:56:46,133 --> 0:56:48,166
When we teach it and
using the WorkBook and


1116
0:56:48,166 --> 0:56:51,5
all the visual aids, we can
teach it in about 15 hours.


1117
0:56:51,5 --> 0:56:56,533
And, we find that
there's a lot more people


1118
0:56:56,533 --> 0:56:58,567
that you'd imagine that are
quite willing to sit down


1119
0:56:58,567 --> 0:57:2,367
and have an objective Bible
presentation given to them.


1120
0:57:2,367 --> 0:57:4,333
They want to know
about these things.


1121
0:57:4,333 --> 0:57:6,533
And it's because it's a big
thing. And, you know, I


1122
0:57:6,533 --> 0:57:10,4
think it's uniquely a very
Western thing, that what


1123
0:57:10,4 --> 0:57:12,5
we try to do with the
Gospel is we try to say,


1124
0:57:12,5 --> 0:57:15,8
"How little can I get away
with to get the guy saved?"


1125
0:57:15,8 --> 0:57:18,8
You know? We just kinda
try and shrink it down.


1126
0:57:18,8 --> 0:57:21,367
We want to have the
McDonald's mindset.


1127
0:57:21,367 --> 0:57:22,9
You know, when you drive
through the drive through:


1128
0:57:22,9 --> 0:57:26,33
"Big Mac, order of fries,
strawberry shake. Quick!


1129
0:57:26,33 --> 0:57:29,667
Come on, come on, come on,
come on! Is this not fast food?"


1130
0:57:29,667 --> 0:57:32,767
And we want to have
a fast gospel.


1131
0:57:32,767 --> 0:57:35,367
And we want to be able to list
little things off there--bang!


1132
0:57:35,367 --> 0:57:38,333
But, you know what? In doing
that, we do disservice


1133
0:57:38,333 --> 0:57:40,4
to the grandeur and the
greatness of this message.


1134
0:57:40,4 --> 0:57:44,567
Generally speaking, in life,
people that are making big


1135
0:57:44,567 --> 0:57:47,1
decisions give a
little thought to it.


1136
0:57:47,1 --> 0:57:48,433
You know, when you go
out to buy a house,


1137
0:57:48,433 --> 0:57:49,834
it's not something
you get up in the morning


1138
0:57:49,834 --> 0:57:52,3
and on the way to
work, you buy a house.


1139
0:57:52,3 --> 0:57:54,667
You don't do that. No.


1140
0:57:54,667 --> 0:57:58,533
You put a lot of thought into
it, and you do some research.


1141
0:57:58,533 --> 0:58:0,967
Now, what we have found is that
people are very appreciative


1142
0:58:0,967 --> 0:58:4,166
when you sit down and you are
able to explain it through.


1143
0:58:4,166 --> 0:58:6,767
And as you do that: as
you go from creation


1144
0:58:6,767 --> 0:58:9,333
through to Christ, you
know what you are doing?


1145
0:58:9,333 --> 0:58:13,7
What you are doing is
this: you're flying
truths in formation.


1146
0:58:13,7 --> 0:58:16,1
Prophetic events are
verifying the message.


1147
0:58:16,1 --> 0:58:18,967
Types are revealing and
anchoring the doctrines


1148
0:58:18,967 --> 0:58:20,533
in the individual's mind.


1149
0:58:20,533 --> 0:58:23,2
Stories are defining the words
for them so that they are making


1150
0:58:23,2 --> 0:58:25,5
sure that they're
understanding exactly
what you're talking about


1151
0:58:25,5 --> 0:58:29,9
when you're using words like
sin, and God, and righteousness.


1152
0:58:29,9 --> 0:58:32,266
And the word pictures are
anchoring those doctrines,


1153
0:58:32,266 --> 0:58:34,2
so you have absolutely no
doubt what happened


1154
0:58:34,2 --> 0:58:37,333
on the cross and
in the tomb.


1155
0:58:37,333 --> 0:58:39,0
And, I believe, that's
what we want to do.


1156
0:58:39,0 --> 0:58:42,3
We want to take advantage of
the architecture in the Bible.


1157
0:58:42,3 --> 0:58:44,967
We want to have truths flying
in formation so that they


1158
0:58:44,967 --> 0:58:46,967
will protect each other.


1159
0:58:46,967 --> 0:58:48,934
So that it comes out with
a very powerful statement


1160
0:58:48,934 --> 0:58:52,867
and it screams in the face of
the individual: "This is true.


1161
0:58:52,867 --> 0:58:55,4
Please believe it."


1162
0:58:55,4 --> 0:58:58,5
And, I believe, that
what it means when we
talked about yesterday--


1163
0:58:58,5 --> 0:59:2,333
being an ambassador--when it
says it's as though God himself


1164
0:59:2,333 --> 0:59:8,3
is speaking through
us, and he's imploring
a lost and dying world:


1165
0:59:8,3 --> 0:59:13,166
"Please, please, be
reconciled to me."


1166
0:59:13,166 --> 0:59:17,633
If we don't do that, this
is what we're doing,


1167
0:59:17,633 --> 0:59:21,834
so often. And what we're
doing is, we're taking an


1168
0:59:21,834 --> 0:59:25,367
extrememly powerful
airforce of truth,


1169
0:59:25,367 --> 0:59:27,4
and we're leaving most
of it on the ground.


1170
0:59:27,4 --> 0:59:31,4
And we're sending off this one
little truth, to fly by itself,


1171
0:59:31,4 --> 0:59:34,667
and we're saying,
"Yep, it should do the trick."


1172
0:59:34,667 --> 0:59:36,533
When really what
we need to be doing is,


1173
0:59:36,533 --> 0:59:38,667
we need to be putting our
whole air force in the air


1174
0:59:38,667 --> 0:59:41,266
and saying, "Now listen
folks, when we talk about


1175
0:59:41,266 --> 0:59:45,6
"the Scripture being inspired by
God, this is what it means.


1176
0:59:45,6 --> 0:59:47,633
This is the face of it."


1177
0:59:47,633 --> 0:59:52,133
And when you fly this group of
information together,


1178
0:59:52,133 --> 0:59:55,633
as you do that, it just has
a very, very powerful


1179
0:59:55,633 --> 1:0:0,66
statement that,
"Yes, it is true."


1180
1:0:0,66 --> 1:0:2,6
And that's why we do this.


1181
1:0:2,6 --> 1:2:2,6
That's why we're doing it.
