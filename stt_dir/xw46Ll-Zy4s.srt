1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,64



2
0:0:4,64 --> 0:0:6,135
SHANE SMITH: Where
are going now?


3
0:0:6,135 --> 0:0:9,51
MR. KIM: We are going to
military demarcation line.


4
0:0:9,51 --> 0:0:38,6



5
0:0:38,6 --> 0:0:41,55
SHANE SMITH: Your political
indoctrination continues when


6
0:0:41,55 --> 0:0:45,5
the North Koreans take you
to their side of the DMZ.


7
0:0:45,5 --> 0:0:48,61
And going to the DMZ from the
north is a completely


8
0:0:48,61 --> 0:0:51,59
different animal than going
to the DMZ from the south.


9
0:0:51,59 --> 0:0:53,32
From the south, you have to
go through checkpoint,


10
0:0:53,32 --> 0:0:55,18
checkpoint, checkpoint,
checkpoint.


11
0:0:55,18 --> 0:0:57,2
On the North Korean side,
you go from Pyongyang.


12
0:0:57,2 --> 0:0:58,62
It's about a 2 and
1/2 hour drive.


13
0:0:58,62 --> 0:1:0,55
But when you go there,
actually, it's a


14
0:1:0,55 --> 0:1:1,53
lot more laid back.


15
0:1:1,53 --> 0:1:4,849
Although you do notice, on the
drive in, there's a hell of a


16
0:1:4,849 --> 0:1:6,91
lot more troops on the
North Korean side.


17
0:1:6,91 --> 0:1:8,765
And everywhere there's these
massive monuments.


18
0:1:8,765 --> 0:1:10,67
And you're like, what
are those monuments?


19
0:1:10,67 --> 0:1:13,1
And they say, oh, they're
filled with dynamite.


20
0:1:13,1 --> 0:1:15,51
And if there's ever an invasion,
they blow up, and


21
0:1:15,51 --> 0:1:16,37
they fall down.


22
0:1:16,37 --> 0:1:17,62
And they are tank barriers.


23
0:1:17,62 --> 0:1:29,31



24
0:1:29,31 --> 0:1:31,715
And unlike the South Korean
side, you can


25
0:1:31,715 --> 0:1:32,1
shoot what you want.


26
0:1:32,1 --> 0:1:33,15
You can point at people.


27
0:1:33,15 --> 0:1:33,73
you can give them the finger.


28
0:1:33,73 --> 0:1:34,9
You can do whatever you want.


29
0:1:34,9 --> 0:1:36,25
You can drink beer.


30
0:1:36,25 --> 0:1:38,5
[LAUGHTER]


31
0:1:38,5 --> 0:1:39,59
SHANE SMITH: So basically,
it's a big


32
0:1:39,59 --> 0:1:40,53
"fuck you" to the South.


33
0:1:40,53 --> 0:1:41,78
It's a big "fuck you"
to the Americans.


34
0:1:41,78 --> 0:1:54,408



35
0:1:54,408 --> 0:1:59,72
We're in Panmunjeom, in the
demilitarized zone, where the


36
0:1:59,72 --> 0:2:5,256
armistice was signed between
the DPRK and the UN.


37
0:2:5,256 --> 0:2:14,95



38
0:2:14,95 --> 0:2:17,57
SHANE SMITH: All they want to
do is tell you about how bad


39
0:2:17,57 --> 0:2:20,69
the Americans are, this is where
we defeated the American


40
0:2:20,69 --> 0:2:24,64
imperialist aggressors, this is
where North Korea shut down


41
0:2:24,64 --> 0:2:26,63
the biggest military
power in the world.


42
0:2:26,63 --> 0:2:28,265
And that's what everything
is designed to do.


43
0:2:28,265 --> 0:2:36,376



44
0:2:36,376 --> 0:2:39,292
We're on night vision because
there's no electricity in


45
0:2:39,292 --> 0:2:40,542
Panmunjeom.


46
0:2:40,542 --> 0:2:44,65



47
0:2:44,65 --> 0:2:45,505
We got in trouble
for shooting.


48
0:2:45,505 --> 0:2:48,676
They said we might get charged
for a criminal offense.


49
0:2:48,676 --> 0:2:53,325
So I'm trying to do this
as quietly as possible.


50
0:2:53,325 --> 0:3:5,88



51
0:3:5,88 --> 0:3:8,366
All you hear at the DMZ is
talk of reunification.


52
0:3:8,366 --> 0:3:14,94



53
0:3:14,94 --> 0:3:16,54
SHANE SMITH: Is this is
a political thing?


54
0:3:16,54 --> 0:3:18,33
Like are you trying
to reunify?


55
0:3:18,33 --> 0:3:19,26
They won't mention--


56
0:3:19,26 --> 0:3:20,285
just reunify, reunify.


57
0:3:20,285 --> 0:3:21,89
You think one day they
will be unified?


58
0:3:21,89 --> 0:3:34,63



59
0:3:34,63 --> 0:3:35,76
SHANE SMITH: At that
point you go--


60
0:3:35,76 --> 0:3:38,5
these guys are serious,
serious dudes.


61
0:3:38,5 --> 0:3:52,34



62
0:3:52,34 --> 0:3:54,81
And then, on the way back, you
stop off and you have a meal.


63
0:3:54,81 --> 0:3:56,1
And they're like, oh,
you're hungry?


64
0:3:56,1 --> 0:3:58,92
Hey, let's just stop at this--
any old restaurant.


65
0:3:58,92 --> 0:4:1,6
And they're pretending, like,
this is like any restaurant.


66
0:4:1,6 --> 0:4:2,1
We just showed up.


67
0:4:2,1 --> 0:4:4,7
Hey, McDonald's on the
side of the road.


68
0:4:4,7 --> 0:4:5,37
But let's say there's
seven of you.


69
0:4:5,37 --> 0:4:6,25
You get to the restaurant.


70
0:4:6,25 --> 0:4:8,34
There's seven places laid out,
and the whole of the


71
0:4:8,34 --> 0:4:9,43
restaurant is empty.


72
0:4:9,43 --> 0:4:10,73
It's been choreographed.


73
0:4:10,73 --> 0:4:12,94
They've been waiting for you for
two days, all set up-- the


74
0:4:12,94 --> 0:4:14,37
whole restaurant
waiting to go.


75
0:4:14,37 --> 0:4:17,27
We're in Kaesong, in
a nice restaurant.


76
0:4:17,27 --> 0:4:19,51
We just had a lovely meal.


77
0:4:19,51 --> 0:4:22,63
You have lunch, which is like
50 plates of little shit.


78
0:4:22,63 --> 0:4:24,5
Again, you can't
eat any of it.


79
0:4:24,5 --> 0:4:26,615
But it's like-- just look
how much food we have.


80
0:4:26,615 --> 0:4:28,15
We're so great.


81
0:4:28,15 --> 0:4:29,138
Kinda quiet.


82
0:4:29,138 --> 0:4:32,102
Kinda quiet.


83
0:4:32,102 --> 0:4:33,584
[SIGH]


84
0:4:33,584 --> 0:4:35,57
[INAUDIBLE].


85
0:4:35,57 --> 0:4:38,9
So your first two days
there you're


86
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:41,0
like, crazy food, politics.


87
0:4:41,0 --> 0:4:42,59
Crazy food, politics.


88
0:4:42,59 --> 0:4:45,472
So you start to get a bit
freaked out at this point.


89
0:4:45,472 --> 0:4:46,915
Thank you.


90
0:4:46,915 --> 0:4:47,877
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.


91
0:4:47,877 --> 0:4:48,839
SHANE SMITH: [LAUGH]


92
0:4:48,839 --> 0:4:49,159
Bye-bye.


93
0:4:49,159 --> 0:4:51,25
FEMALE SPEAKER: Bye.


94
0:4:51,25 --> 0:4:53,57
And then on the way back, you
know, thinking, this is the


95
0:4:53,57 --> 0:4:57,6
fourth largest army in the
world, all along this border.


96
0:4:57,6 --> 0:4:59,1
And they've threatened
America with nukes--


97
0:4:59,1 --> 0:5:0,11
and Japan with nukes.


98
0:5:0,11 --> 0:5:2,19
I'm like, how can
they have nukes?


99
0:5:2,19 --> 0:5:3,92
They don't have electricity.


100
0:5:3,92 --> 0:5:6,22
It's like turn-of-the-century
industrial Britain.


101
0:5:6,22 --> 0:5:7,47
How do they have nukes?


102
0:5:7,47 --> 0:5:53,73



103
0:5:53,73 --> 0:5:56,89
SHANE SMITH: So, after driving
back from the DMZ and our


104
0:5:56,89 --> 0:5:59,47
choreographed lunch, you realize
that everything is


105
0:5:59,47 --> 0:6:0,91
going to be choreographed.


106
0:6:0,91 --> 0:6:2,48
Like, hey, what do you
want to do tonight?


107
0:6:2,48 --> 0:6:3,635
Want to go for a few beers?


108
0:6:3,635 --> 0:6:5,26
And you're like, hey,
this isn't so bad.


109
0:6:5,26 --> 0:6:6,97
Sure, let's go out
for a few beers.


110
0:6:6,97 --> 0:6:10,82
And you go out to the sort of
state-sanctioned karaoke


111
0:6:10,82 --> 0:6:13,3
place, which is only, really,
for foreigners and really


112
0:6:13,3 --> 0:6:14,8
high-ranking party officials.


113
0:6:14,8 --> 0:7:1,424
[SINGING IN KOREAN]


114
0:7:1,424 --> 0:7:3,408
[APPLAUSE]


115
0:7:3,408 --> 0:7:5,65
SHANE SMITH: Now the guards
have been waiting.


116
0:7:5,65 --> 0:7:8,52
They've studied their whole
life, you know, English, and


117
0:7:8,52 --> 0:7:10,41
they've studied political
dialectics.


118
0:7:10,41 --> 0:7:12,37
So that they're the best
and the brightest.


119
0:7:12,37 --> 0:7:13,985
And this is like the
top position.


120
0:7:13,985 --> 0:7:16,95
But they have to wait all year
for about 10 days for any


121
0:7:16,95 --> 0:7:17,99
tourists to come.


122
0:7:17,99 --> 0:7:20,41
So there's kind of this weird--
like they're holding


123
0:7:20,41 --> 0:7:22,5
back their excitement because
they get to eat, and they get


124
0:7:22,5 --> 0:7:24,27
to drink, and smoke cigarettes,
and all these


125
0:7:24,27 --> 0:7:25,13
great things.


126
0:7:25,13 --> 0:7:26,68
And you can see them
vibrating--


127
0:7:26,68 --> 0:7:27,61
they're so excited.


128
0:7:27,61 --> 0:7:28,74
You know, yeah, have
some cigarettes.


129
0:7:28,74 --> 0:7:31,17
And they're like, "oh god,"
and drinking, but they are


130
0:7:31,17 --> 0:7:32,68
trying not to show it.


131
0:7:32,68 --> 0:7:34,508
Check one, two.


132
0:7:34,508 --> 0:7:35,422
MR LEE: [LAUGH]


133
0:7:35,422 --> 0:7:37,39
Check two, one two, one two.


134
0:7:37,39 --> 0:7:38,764

SHANE SMITH: To the museum?


140
0:8:11,98 --> 0:8:12,33
MALE SPEAKER 1: Museum.


141
0:8:12,33 --> 0:8:13,58
SHANE SMITH: Museum, yeah.


142
0:8:13,58 --> 0:8:16,13



143
0:8:16,13 --> 0:8:19,0
SHANE SMITH: The International
Friendship Exhibition Hall.


144
0:8:19,0 --> 0:8:22,34
And we're going to
buy some ties.


145
0:8:22,34 --> 0:8:25,66



146
0:8:25,66 --> 0:8:27,47
SHANE SMITH: Bad for you?


147
0:8:27,47 --> 0:8:29,7
It's bad for everybody.


148

SHANE SMITH: [SINGING IN KOREAN]


151
0:8:38,23 --> 0:8:39,59
What does it mean?


152
0:8:39,59 --> 0:8:40,302
Hello?


153
0:8:40,302 --> 0:8:41,679

glad to meet you.

to meet you.


155
0:8:44,39 --> 0:8:45,66
That's why you shake hands.


156
0:8:45,66 --> 0:8:50,99



157
0:8:50,99 --> 0:8:52,49

when you sing it, you always


158
0:8:52,49 --> 0:8:53,8
shake hands.


159
0:8:53,8 --> 0:8:53,86
MR LEE: Yeah.


160
0:8:53,86 --> 0:8:55,95

164
0:9:2,56 --> 0:9:3,32
SHANE SMITH: Oh, OK.


165
0:9:3,32 --> 0:9:4,705
MR LEE: This morning.


166

0:9:5,655 --> 0:9:7,56
SHANE SMITH: I see
you this morning.


169
0:9:7,56 --> 0:9:12,76
So we went out on a night on the
town in Pyongyang with our


170
0:9:12,76 --> 0:9:15,52
guards, which is good, because
the guards weren't enjoying us


171
0:9:15,52 --> 0:9:17,13
as human beings.


172
0:9:17,13 --> 0:9:19,79
Today they threatened Jamie,
who's filming this, with--


173
0:9:19,79 --> 0:9:20,93
what was it?


174
0:9:20,93 --> 0:9:24,592
Gross, insensitive crimes to
the republic, or something?


175
0:9:24,592 --> 0:9:25,504
JAMIE: Criminal offenses.


176
0:9:25,504 --> 0:9:25,96
SHANE SMITH: Criminal
offenses.


177
0:9:25,96 --> 0:9:29,6
JAMIE: --which would have
severe repercussions.


178
0:9:29,6 --> 0:9:30,57
SHANE SMITH: All we had to do
was buy like six bottles of


179
0:9:30,57 --> 0:9:34,8
blueberry wine, and everybody
was fine, except for Mr. Lee.


180
0:9:34,8 --> 0:9:37,82
He wanted to fight with us
after we disrespected


181
0:9:37,82 --> 0:9:42,43
[KOREAN], the song that says,
"pleased to meet you."


182
0:9:42,43 --> 0:9:46,958
So we're drinking soju.


183
0:9:46,958 --> 0:9:49,2
And we're going to bed now.


184
0:9:49,2 --> 0:9:50,31
He got mad at me.


185
0:9:50,31 --> 0:9:51,6
Mr. Lee got mad at me.


186
0:9:51,6 --> 0:9:54,56
He goes, it was the first
song I taught you!


187
0:9:54,56 --> 0:9:55,23
OK--

0:9:55,23 --> 0:9:56,214

189
0:9:56,214 --> 0:9:59,658

you taught me, Mr. Lee.


190
0:9:59,658 --> 0:10:1,134
OK, honeybun.


191
0:10:1,134 --> 0:10:2,118

0:10:2,118 --> 0:10:3,368

193
0:10:3,368 --> 0:10:37,12



194
0:10:37,12 --> 0:10:39,23
SHANE SMITH: So once they
get through with the


195
0:10:39,23 --> 0:10:40,49
indoctrination--


196
0:10:40,49 --> 0:10:44,46
like, the Pueblo and DMZ-- of
how bad the Americans are,


197
0:10:44,46 --> 0:10:45,18
then begins--


198
0:10:45,18 --> 0:10:46,45
how great we are.


199
0:10:46,45 --> 0:10:47,5
And that starts with Kim


200
0:10:47,5 --> 0:10:49,5
Il-Sung, the Eternal President.


201
0:10:49,5 --> 0:10:52,37
And everybody has to go and
pay their respects to the


202
0:10:52,37 --> 0:10:55,68
great statue of Kim Il-Sung,
who, although he's been dead


203
0:10:55,68 --> 0:10:58,62
since 1994, is still the
president of North Korea.


204
0:10:58,62 --> 0:11:23,622



205
0:11:23,622 --> 0:11:24,73
I'm going to lay a
wreath at the the


206
0:11:24,73 --> 0:11:27,654
statute of Kim Il-Sung.


207
0:11:27,654 --> 0:11:30,606
We have to do this as
a token of respect.


208
0:11:30,606 --> 0:11:40,85



209
0:11:40,85 --> 0:11:44,84
And then they took us two hours
south of Pyongyang to


210
0:11:44,84 --> 0:11:48,76
the International Friendship
Exhibition, which is this


211
0:11:48,76 --> 0:11:53,72
2000-room sort of fortress
cut into a mountain--


212
0:11:53,72 --> 0:11:56,34
deep into a mountain, like
20 stories down.


213
0:11:56,34 --> 0:12:0,5
And what it is, is it's all
these presents that were given


214
0:12:0,5 --> 0:12:3,49
or sent to Kim Il-Sung by heads
of state or foreign


215
0:12:3,49 --> 0:12:5,2
dignitaries or notaries.


216
0:12:5,2 --> 0:12:7,82
They are so paranoid about
anyone finding out about these


217
0:12:7,82 --> 0:12:10,88
treasures that they won't let
you know where this is.


218
0:12:10,88 --> 0:12:11,98
They won't tell you anything.


219
0:12:11,98 --> 0:12:13,87
And of course, you can't
shoot there.


220
0:12:13,87 --> 0:12:15,93
And in fact, they got really
mad even when we


221
0:12:15,93 --> 0:12:17,45
were shooting outside.


222
0:12:17,45 --> 0:12:19,84
He took my camera, and he said,
how much memory does


223
0:12:19,84 --> 0:12:20,97
your camera have?


224
0:12:20,97 --> 0:12:25,11
And I'm like, oh, I don't know,
48 megs or something.


225
0:12:25,11 --> 0:12:25,93
And he opened it up.


226
0:12:25,93 --> 0:12:26,62
And he took it out.


227
0:12:26,62 --> 0:12:29,52
And I had a 5 gig card because
I was shooting actual movies


228
0:12:29,52 --> 0:12:30,89
with it on the sly.


229
0:12:30,89 --> 0:12:32,14
And he goes, you're a liar.


230
0:12:32,14 --> 0:12:33,17
You lied to me.


231
0:12:33,17 --> 0:12:34,8
You know very well
that's not true.


232
0:12:34,8 --> 0:12:35,95
This is five gigs.


233
0:12:35,95 --> 0:12:38,8
And even if I had taken pictures
down there, which I


234
0:12:38,8 --> 0:12:40,7
didn't, they just take out
your memory card and say,


235
0:12:40,7 --> 0:12:41,22
thank you very much.


236
0:12:41,22 --> 0:12:43,266
So we're hiding from our guards
right now, who don't


237
0:12:43,266 --> 0:12:45,402
want us to film anything.


238
0:12:45,402 --> 0:12:48,71
We have to keep quiet.


239
0:12:48,71 --> 0:12:50,47
We're allowed to be
quiet up here.


240
0:12:50,47 --> 0:12:52,15
They're relaxing and having tea
right now, so we've got a


241
0:12:52,15 --> 0:12:53,97
few seconds.


242
0:12:53,97 --> 0:12:57,27
We're at the International
Friendship Museum, or


243
0:12:57,27 --> 0:13:0,43
otherwise known as the
international insanity museum,


244
0:13:0,43 --> 0:13:3,1
where all the presents from
all around the world came.


245
0:13:3,1 --> 0:13:6,68
And it's like alligators holding
trays and all kinds of


246
0:13:6,68 --> 0:13:7,745
dead animals.


247
0:13:7,745 --> 0:13:10,77
And ivory, like huge ivory,
and all this gold stuff.


248
0:13:10,77 --> 0:13:12,33
They have all this
crazy business.


249
0:13:12,33 --> 0:13:15,29
And there's so many attractions
there, so many


250
0:13:15,29 --> 0:13:18,43
treasures, that, if you were to
stop and look at each one,


251
0:13:18,43 --> 0:13:20,68
it would take a year and
a half to get through.


252
0:13:20,68 --> 0:13:22,71
Everybody goes on this
pilgrimage at one time in


253
0:13:22,71 --> 0:13:23,23
their lives.


254
0:13:23,23 --> 0:13:25,52
And they wear their
best clothes.


255
0:13:25,52 --> 0:13:27,37
The women get dressed up
in native costume.


256
0:13:27,37 --> 0:13:28,69
The men wear their uniforms.


257
0:13:28,69 --> 0:13:32,4
And what a benevolent god
because he's sharing all these


258
0:13:32,4 --> 0:13:34,33
amazing treasures, like
he would share


259
0:13:34,33 --> 0:13:35,28
them with his children.


260
0:13:35,28 --> 0:13:38,73
So they think that every leader
in the world thinks


261
0:13:38,73 --> 0:13:40,2
that Kim Il-Sung is the best.


262
0:13:40,2 --> 0:13:43,24
Not that we're mad at them, or
North Korea's on it's own.


263
0:13:43,24 --> 0:13:44,92
They think Kim Il-Sung
is the best.


264
0:13:44,92 --> 0:13:48,19
They don't understand that the
world is mad at North Korea.


265
0:13:48,19 --> 0:15:5,356



266
0:15:5,356 --> 0:15:7,47
SHANE SMITH: Going to the
subway, for us, was a really


267
0:15:7,47 --> 0:15:9,44
big deal because
we never got to


268
0:15:9,44 --> 0:15:10,7
interact with North Koreans.


269
0:15:10,7 --> 0:15:12,4
And we were like, wow,
we get to see


270
0:15:12,4 --> 0:15:12,945
real, live North Koreans.


271
0:15:12,945 --> 0:15:15,7
We're going down
into the metro.


272
0:15:15,7 --> 0:15:16,726
We're going down deep.


273
0:15:16,726 --> 0:15:20,92
This is amazing because it's a
working subway, bomb shelter,


274
0:15:20,92 --> 0:15:24,536
and beautiful thing.


275
0:15:24,536 --> 0:15:28,7
They either try to ignore you,
or they're incredibly


276
0:15:28,7 --> 0:15:30,3
fascinated by you.


277
0:15:30,3 --> 0:15:32,47
And a lot of them look at you,
and they do not like you


278
0:15:32,47 --> 0:15:34,83
because they've been told you're
the devil since they


279
0:15:34,83 --> 0:15:36,8
were two years old.


280
0:15:36,8 --> 0:15:46,14



281
0:15:46,14 --> 0:15:47,96
Subways are a big thing in
communist countries.


282
0:15:47,96 --> 0:15:52,6
I mean, Moscow is famous for its
lavish stops on its public


283
0:15:52,6 --> 0:15:54,48
transportation system,
as is Pyongyang--


284
0:15:54,48 --> 0:15:56,14
you know, look at how
great our public


285
0:15:56,14 --> 0:15:57,39
transport system is.


286
0:15:57,39 --> 0:16:16,77



287
0:16:16,77 --> 0:16:20,29
So you get to go from one stop
to another stop, both of which


288
0:16:20,29 --> 0:16:23,332
are incredibly lavish
and over the top.


289
0:16:23,332 --> 0:16:24,28
SHANE SMITH: Fireworks,
fireworks.


290
0:16:24,28 --> 0:16:25,23
Ah.


291
0:16:25,23 --> 0:16:26,73
The rest aren't as lavish.


292
0:16:26,73 --> 0:16:29,71
And apparently, the rest are
just tiny little, five feet


293
0:16:29,71 --> 0:16:32,75
tall things that you come out of
that are really functional.


294
0:16:32,75 --> 0:16:35,34
But they have two, sort of,
monumental ones that you're


295
0:16:35,34 --> 0:16:35,84
allowed to see.


296
0:16:35,84 --> 0:16:37,82
You're not allowed to
see the other ones.


297
0:16:37,82 --> 0:17:3,6



298
0:17:3,6 --> 0:17:8,23
And as you come out, you realize
this is 1950s Russia.


299
0:17:8,23 --> 0:17:9,579
This is Soviet Russia.


300
0:17:9,579 --> 0:17:11,5
This is Maoist China.


301
0:17:11,5 --> 0:17:12,51
I've come back in a time warp.


302
0:17:12,51 --> 0:19:12,51
