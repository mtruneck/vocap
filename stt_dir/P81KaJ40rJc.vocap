###0 
###1 -Hey, what is that?
###3 FABIAN ALOMAR: It's a mirror that I had in prison.
###5 I had this for the last five years I was there.
###10 You've got to smuggle it wherever you go.
###14 I'd be shaving and looking at myself in the mirror.
###20 
###23 Then, I could see who's coming or who's going.
###27 When they come and search your cell, they
###29 hit yourself so hard.
###31 And they like to break things and take things.
###33 So this mirror has made it with me most of the time--
###38 more than half of my way in there.
###41 STEVEN CALES: Skating is Peter Smolik said--
###44 there's no coaches.
###45 You're your own boss.
###46 So there's really no structure is the right word-- to be
###50 like, hey, you've got to get up.
###52 You've got to do this.
###53 And we do what we want.
###57 So you've got to live and learn, you
###60 know what I'm saying?
###62 
###68 FABIAN ALOMAR: How we even got into skating was crazy.
###70 I stole my first board.
###72 I didn't even know about skating.
###73 I see two oriental kids on the block when we were on bikes.
###76 And we went and told them that we could borrow their
###79 skateboards, because they seen them hopping on the board.
###82 I hit them up, like how much are they?
###83 How much are these boards?
###84 And they told us this price, and it was $49.50 at the time.
###88 $49.50 is a lot of money for my mom and dad.
###91 So where do we go?
###93 We went out towards Beverly Hills, Eagle Rock, Glendale
###97 looking around.
###99 And I hate to say it, but we were looking around for little
###101 white boys to rob them.
###103 
###108 JOEY SURIEL: I had seen him skate a few times when he
###110 would come riding around with our other friend, Juan.
###114 And I knew these guys were on top of their game.
###116 They were the best I had seen, so I said, OK, there are the
###119 guys I need to be around.
###121 I wanted to be around the best.
###122 And I knew that being around Fabian was going to help me.
###128 FABIAN ALOMAR: Back in the day, back in '87, '88, we used
###131 to go to this ramp on 23rd and Vermont near USC.
###134 And to get there, you've got to pass through at least three
###137 or four different gang neighborhoods.
###138 -At least, at least.
###139 FABIAN ALOMAR: So to get there and to come
###141 back home was a mission.
###143 -I lived in a gang neighborhood.
###146 FABIAN ALOMAR: Rockwood.
###147 -And I guess a rival gang had come looking to shoot up, and
###151 they actually caught us right when Fabian
###154 was about to leave.
###155 And I was like, all right, man, I'll see you later.
###158 FABIAN ALOMAR: It was a burgundy Regal with a sun
###160 roof.
###161 -And then soon as I look, I was like, yo, these guys are
###163 cruising by real slow.
###164 FABIAN ALOMAR: It was like this.
###165 -All of a sudden, bro, all I remember was some dude coming
###168 out of the roof-- yo, the first time
###170 I've see a real Uzi.
###173 I remember when you are in here, it was like you in a
###176 different world.
###177 You forget that you were in the hood.
###180 You forget.
###180 There'd be I don't even know how many shootouts
###183 we've see back then.
###185 -You think it's a nicer area now?
###187 FABIAN ALOMAR: Now, it's way nicer.
###188 Echo Park all the way up to here at Silver Lake, as of
###192 2002 or 2003, it really changed.
###196 You see a lot more artsy people living in Echo Park
###200 running around now.
###201 Back then--
###203 I grew up, born and raised there--
###205 and you would never seen that.
###208 Yeah, all right in this area right here there's Crazies,
###213 Echo Park, Headhunters and Diamond.
###216 We're on Douglas Street.
###217 If you go two blocks up and to the left,
###220 that's Diamond's street.
###221 This is Headhunters.
###223 -So why is that?
###224 Why don't--
###226 FABIAN ALOMAR: It's just who it is.
###228 A group of kids that grew up on this block didn't get along
###232 with the group of kids that are on that block.
###235 And that's how it started.
###238 Back in the '80s.
###239 And there's always been 18th Street lurking around.
###243 
###245 Our whole family was raised right here.
###247 We lived here.
###248 My mom, she was raised right here, too.
###251 -In this house.
###252 FABIAN ALOMAR: In this house, yeah.
###254 If you're talking about gang area, this is Headhunters.
###256 -This is where you started skating?
###258 FABIAN ALOMAR: No, I was too small.
###260 Right here was just me growing up, learning
###262 how to ride a bike.
###264 -Those are bullet holes.
###265 FABIAN ALOMAR: Yeah.
###266 Look, you can see.
###267 Those are bullet holes right there.
###269 If these streets could talk, they'd have a better story to
###271 tell you than what I could--
###272 a way better story.
###275 Like I said, a lot of my friends in skateboarding used
###278 to really trip out on how they would see my dad or my uncles,
###286 my sisters, everybody in my family, were
###289 considered gang members.
###291 And you're guilty by association, regardless.
###297 A lot of the times, they wouldn't even want to drop me
###299 off at home.
###299 Like I said, they would--
###301 two blocks away and let me walk the rest.
###304 GINO IANNUCCI: Well, I remember meeting Fabian.
###305 And the first impression was that he was a nice guy.
###307 He was really cool.
###309 He was just down to introduce himself.
###310 And he was just a good guy.
###313 But I knew that he was real.
###314 I knew that if a time came when he had to throw down or
###317 anything like that, I wouldn't want to fuck with him.
###319 And I knew that his family was all up in it and skateboarding
###323 kept him away from that.
###325 -Were you in a gang or anything like that?
###326 Or just joined what they were doing?
###329 FABIAN ALOMAR: Yeah, I did.
###330 But I never got too deep into it.
###333 I knew it was always there, because I was
###334 born into it, man.
###336 There's no oh, I want to go hang out with these guys.
###340 I'd go home and I'd be with them guys,
###341 you know what I mean?
###343 It's a difference when you've got to go somewhere and be
###345 with your home boys or your gang.
###349 But when you go home and you live with it,
###351 it's nothing to you.
###353 It's just how you are.
###354 
###363 -Who would you say, out of the Menace guys was the most
###367 motivated to get tricks?
###368 SOCRATES LEAL: Probably Joey and Fabian.
###371 Those guys were always motivated.
###373 Fabian would call me.
###374 You want to go film?
###375 Like, yeah.
###376 -Were there, though, a lot of other crazy stories, filming
###379 with Fabian?
###380 SOCRATES LEAL: I wouldn't say just crazy, just maybe not
###384 normal for regular skaters.
###385 But Fabian wasn't like your regular skater.
###389 He just didn't take bullshit.
###390 
###393 JOEY SURIEL: Since we were kids, Fabian always had a
###397 short fuse.
###398 Not to mention everything was put on a platter for us, from
###404 women to drugs to fame.
###406 So you add that to the formula, and it's a recipe for
###411 destruction.
###412 
###415 FABIAN ALOMAR: Skateboarding saved me from getting into
###418 trouble, but at the same time, I think I had a lot of time
###421 and money in my hands.
###423 From not having nothing to have a little something, it
###426 felt pretty good.
###427 And sometimes you think you're invincible.
###429 
###433 Oh, man, you know what?
###434 I've got to take you to this house.
###436 It was a drug house.
###436 Instead of having a big pitbull, I
###439 was their guard dog.
###441 They know that I used to skateboard and everything.
###443 They trusted me.
###444 When my money was good, they loved me.
###446 You know what I mean?
###447 When the money was good, I had all kinds of money to buy dope
###450 from them and to give them skateboards when they need it
###453 for their kids or whatever.
###454 And then when my money ran out, guess what?
###458 They didn't like me no more.
###460 
###468 FABIAN ALOMAR: I was selling and doing, mostly doing.
###469 But one thing I did and I'm thankful for is I separated
###474 the gang life and my drug use and my skateboarding--
###478 for a lot of reasons, mainly because I was embarrassed and
###482 I didn't want to show my face.
###483 And I was looked at as Fabian Alomar, pro skater.
###487 He's a good skater.
###488 A real ghetto kid, real coming up.
###490 And I didn't want to ruin that.
###494 That image I had was good, because I kept skating and I
###496 produced and I did everything I was supposed to do.
###498 But I felt this weird feeling inside.
###501 I couldn't come around.
###503 I didn't want to burn no bridges.
###505 I couldn't burn my bridges with skateboarding.
###507 I wanted to keep it separate.
###508 So I stood in the hood.
###509 I stood around in the spots where no one will come.
###512 JAVIER NUNEZ: He grew up in the streets, so it was tough
###514 to make a transition to being a full on skate and shit.
###520 You skate and then you go back to the hood, and then you're
###523 dealing with all these obstacles.
###525 It's not like we're going back to the suburbs and it's all
###527 good and we can skate every day.
###529 It wasn't like.
###530 And it caught up to them.
###533 Fabian got locked up.
###536 That's when [INAUDIBLE] was like, you know?
###538 I got to think about making it a real skate company, not
###542 about an image thing.
###544 FABIAN ALOMAR: There were so many things going on in my
###546 life at the time that it was bound to happen.
###550 I showed up to Karim's house to pick up my check one day.
###553 And he's telling me, you know this is probably one of your
###555 last checks right here.
###557 This is it.
###560 I've cut you so low that I can't be-- and now, I don't
###564 see you doing anything.
###565 And I'm telling them--
###566 and it's true-- my ankle was swollen, but
###569 from skating on dope.
###574 Once I got kicked off, things took a whole other turn.
###581 See where that bungalow is?
###583 -Yeah.
###583 FABIAN ALOMAR: That fence where the diamond is, the
###586 baseball diamond?
###588 There's bathrooms right there.
###590 You see?
###590 There they are.
###590 The white bathrooms?
###591 Those were my offices, my [SPANISH].
###594 Anybody who when in there got fucked up while
###596 I was smoking crack.
###598 These dudes playing tennis, these little Filipino dudes
###601 and shit-- they all all go in there in the morning and
###603 they're like, (ACCENT) hey, it's 7 o'clock in the morning.
###605 Let's go play some tennis.
###607 And they go in there and they want to play tennis and they
###609 want-- (ACCENT) hey, why is the bathroom locked and shit?
###612 I could hear them talking.
###613 And they would try to force it open, because I'd locked it on
###616 purpose because I'm in there smoking dope looking at nudie
###619 magazines and shit.
###620 And that's what I did.
###621 I'd do me and do me.
###622 So I'm in there fucking doing my thing.
###624 Wait, that's my church.
###628 So I'm getting loaded in there, and they're fucking up
###632 my high by trying to get into my offices.
###635 And I'd be like, man, what the fuck?
###637 So when they come in, all they did was get robbed.
###640 I'd fuck them up and then I'd end up leaving.
###644 I would say a prayer before I go rob you.
###647 God, please don't let me get caught.
###649 Don't let me get hurt.
###650 I'm sorry for what I'm about to do.
###652 I know it's wrong, but I feel like I have no choice.
###658 And so I would go and rob this person and jack them.
###661 And I'd let them know, hey, straight up, I'm on dope.
###665 I'm smoking crack.
###667 You'd better give me all your money or you're
###669 going to get hurt.
###671 And if you don't give it up, believe me, I'm going to cut
###674 you or I'm going to shoot you.
###676 So you're bound to give it up either way, whether you want
###680 to walk away or me drive away with you laying there.
###683 So most of the time, they would cooperate.
###686 And I was driving people right outside my door.
###689 When you're on cocaine, that stuff really plays a number on
###692 your head, you know what I mean?
###693 So I would do it at all times--
###695 in the evening.
###696 If I catch you slipping, I would get you
###698 and rob you, whatever.
###699 That was my mentality.
###702 Come here, puppy.
###705 Look at these dogs, man.
###708 They've probably been so abused that they don't trust
###710 nobody, dude.
###711 Look, there he comes.
###713 Get it.
###713 Get it.
###714 
###717 I'm not proud of it, man.
###718 I'm not boasting about it.
###722 I'm not trying to put any light on it in a positive way.
###727 It's a negative thing I was doing.
###729 It was bad.
###729 But at that point my life, I didn't care.
###737 I didn't care about nothing.
###738 I didn't even care about myself, so why would I care
###740 about somebody else?
###741 BILLY VALDES: I think with Fabian, too, that might have
###744 been a consequence of adjusting after skateboarding.
###747 The last time I seen Fabian, I was hungover living in
###751 Hollywood, and he came over the next morning.
###753 And I hadn't seen him in a long time.
###755 And he wanted to sell me a pitbull puppy, because he
###760 knows I'm into dogs, or some sodas--
###764 cases of sodas.
###765 And he with some dude in a random band.
###768 So it was a trip for me.
###771 FABIAN ALOMAR: You want to ride down the alley where I
###773 got arrested for my crime?
###774 This is where I got arrested.
###776 They cornered me in here.
###777 There was five cop cars here and a helicopter.
###781 And they caught me right in this alley right here.
###783 They surrounded me.
###784 I was busted right here.
###784 They told me, get out the car.
###785 They were behind me, in front of me, and I was just trying
###788 to make it to my--
###789 my mom lived two houses away from the dope spot where we
###792 were just that.
###793 And I was trying to make it to my mom's, because I knew these
###795 cops were probably going to beat my ass.
###797 That was it right there.
###798 I got locked up.
###799 I was done.
###800 
###802 I went to prison for eight years.
###805 I got arrested for carjacking, kidnapping, robbery, with an
###811 11 inch ice pick.
###812 The ice pick had someone's DNA, and it had crack residue,
###823 because I was using that same weapon that I used to
###829 whatever, stab, and I was using it to smoke.
###834 And that's why I had it.
###839 They sent me to Salinas Valley, level four.
###843 I was in the 270 yard there.
###846 And it's nothing but solid lifers.
###849 People got life.
###850 People were just straight killers and drug dealers and
###856 nothing bad at all.
###858 
###860 You notice nobody smiles in prison.
###862 So you don't get those smiles.
###866 -You show up the first day and--
###868 FABIAN ALOMAR: You show up, you're new fish.
###872 You're in prison.
###874 You're sketchy on everything.
###875 
###883 FABIAN ALOMAR: That's a good question.
###885 If you were raised here and brought up here and you've got
###888 that the southern Hispanic ways, then you're considered
###897 South sider.
###898 You're a homie automatically, and don't try to get out of it
###901 and don't try to fight it, because a lot of dudes try to
###903 deny just to get away and try to hide.
###906 But if you're actually a Puerto Rican native and come
###911 over here and you don't know what the hell's going on, then
###914 they'll give you a pass and you could be an other.
###917 You could be an other.
###918 Other is--
###921 you could be Samoan, Chinese, you could be whatever.
###927 Others is anything.
###928 It's a mix.
###930 All the southern Mexicans-- we all stick together, man.
###934 I got sent to this other person called
###936 California Men's Colony.
###939 It's no good, meaning no good as far as they hold snitches,
###943 rapists, child molesters.
###946 All of my friends told me, hey, man, you know where
###949 you're going.
###950 You're going to have to get off there and do your thing.
###952 You've got 72 hours to handle your business.
###957 That means I have 72 hours to crack someone, stab them, beat
###963 them up, or whatever I'm going to do.
###966 FABIAN ALOMAR: I was mingling and chopping it up and eating
###968 and hanging out with a bunch of rapists.
###970 And I didn't do nothing.
###972 Nobody likes their kids being touched by
###975 another human being--
###977 man or woman.
###980 So all these people deserved to get cut, and I
###984 cut a couple of them.
###985 
###988 FABIAN ALOMAR: Yeah, a child molester.
###989 I hit him with a razor.
###990 They brought me the paperwork, and I seen it.
###993 I knew the next day what I had to do, which
###996 was Christmas Eve.
###998 I got added more time to me.
###1000 
###1004 FABIAN ALOMAR: Yeah, he survived, unfortunately.
###1005 
###1008 He survived.
###1009 -Well, but if he had died, you would have been still in here.
###1011 FABIAN ALOMAR: Oh, I would still be-- there wouldn't be a
###1012 story right now.
###1015 There wouldn't be a good happy ending to this story.
###1018 
###1021 FABIAN ALOMAR: Oh, yeah.
###1022 Yeah, I only told a few.
###1023 I only told a couple.
###1024 I would get pictures sent to me from the internet--
###1027 pictures of me skating and stuff.
###1028 And I told a couple of my cellies.
###1030 And they were like, wow, that's you?
###1033 Inside there, I used to make a little full on skate park.
###1036 I would get sent cards, or I'd use old cards that my friends
###1039 were trashing.
###1042 They were going to discard and get rid of stuff.
###1044 So I'd set up and tape and use Koolaid for glue, and I'd get
###1050 pieces of tape that come in letters, and I'd make a skate
###1053 park-- like a ramp to wall, pyramid ramp.
###1057 I put together a little mini ramp.
###1061 The boards were hard to make.
###1064 I used to pretend just with my hands,
###1066 just with my two fingers.
###1069 It was always when I go to sleep and lay
###1071 down and knock out.
###1073 I had so many crazy thoughts of different things-- like
###1075 man, what if I would have done this?
###1077 Where would I be if I just continued skating and not got
###1081 caught up in all this drugs and all this crazy violence
###1086 that I did?
###1086 And I should've just stood hanging out with this person,
###1089 or I should have just continued to skate and not--
###1095 why did I-- you know?
###1095 All the whys and what ifs.
###1097 
###1100 You've just got to keep going forward, dog.
###1104 All those questions--
###1105 if you could drive yourself mad with that.
###1107 The very same night I got out, I went to
###1112 Skatelab in Simi Valley.
###1115 FABIAN ALOMAR: I went there just to go, because when it
###1118 first opened, I had a board up there.
###1119 I wanted to see if it was still there or if they kicked
###1122 it out or what.
###1123 And it was there.
###1124 I called up Jeron Wilson and we talked.
###1128 He was like, damn, good to hear from you.
###1130 I'm here.
###1131 I'm here skating with Guy and Costin.
###1133 And I was like, what?
###1135 Let me talk to Guy.
###1137 Guy was like, dude, I'm going to go get you and
###1139 pick you up, man.
###1140 Where you at?
###1142 So he came.
###1143 He picked me up.
###1144 And we hung out.
###1146 We used to always hang out.
###1147 That's my best friend right there.
###1148 That's my boy.
###1150 Once he scooped me up, I embedded the idea of me
###1156 skating again.
###1156 And so he started taking me around with him.
###1159 And yeah, if anybody got me back into it, I
###1161 could say Guy did--
###1163 back into the scene period And I'm going to be honest with
###1168 you, I didn't think skateboarding was going to
###1172 accept back again or have love for me because of what I did.
###1178 I got this board out SK8MAFIA.
###1181 I'm about to put this shit together tomorrow.
###1184 STEVEN CALES: You've got to take advantage of the things
###1187 that skateboarding gives you.
###1188 If you're getting paid and it's paying your bills and you
###1192 ain't got to work, then, man, give skateboarding 115%.
###1198 Just stick to skating, you know what I'm saying?
###1199 And stay out of jail.
###1201 Stay free.
###1201 Stay off of drugs.
###1203 I did 32 months that one time, and then I got out.
###1208 20 days later, I did 24 months.
###1213 And then I had done 20 months.
###1215 And then I had done a year.
###1218 And then I had done six months, which got broken down,
###1221 so I did four months out of that six months.
###1223 Altogether, I say I did about probably a cool
###1227 nine years in jail.
###1231 STEVEN CALES: Oh, yeah.
###1232 Yeah.
###1233 The freedom is so much better, breathing fresh air.
###1238 Fresh air to me is the city buses, dirt, you know?
###1243 Not in the mountains somewhere.
###1245 That's fresh air, but still, out here, it's so much better.
###1249 It's better.
###1249 -This is your fresh air.
###1250 STEVEN CALES: Yeah, it's my fresh air.
###1252 No matter how much money you ain't got or how much money
###1254 you got, freedom is the best, man.
###1257 Nothing is more better.
###1259 It's priceless.
###1260 Fabian is doing good, man.
###1262 I'm proud of him.
###1263 He's doing good.
###1265 I'm not going to say he picked up where he left off, but he's
###1268 doing better than when he left off, even when
###1270 he was doing good.
###1271 He's doing good.
###1272 He's doing really good right now, and I'm proud of him.
###1276 FABIAN ALOMAR: I like the struggle.
###1279 It makes you want to go for more.
###1283 This acting--
###1284 it's making me some money.
###1285 
###1288 FABIAN ALOMAR: I'm working with a few, man,
###1290 like Mos Def on Dexter.
###1295 -You were on Dexter?
###1296 FABIAN ALOMAR: Yeah.
###1299 It's not something that I can say I'm getting rich
###1305 right now from it.
###1306 But I can see the yellow brick road.
###1308 I'm following it, you know what I mean?
###1309 And as long as I say on this road, I'll be OK.
###1312 
###1317 FABIAN ALOMAR: You know what I do miss?
###1320 I miss the good people that I left behind in there.
###1323 I left a lot of good people-- good, solid people that should
###1328 have had another chance.
