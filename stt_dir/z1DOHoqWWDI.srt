0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,4



2
0:0:10,4 --> 0:0:13,54
JEFF BRUSHIE: Snowboarding
started out as, basically, a


3
0:0:13,54 --> 0:0:17,23
way to get down a big
powdery face.


4
0:0:17,23 --> 0:0:22,17
And then all of a sudden, kids
like myself and some others


5
0:0:22,17 --> 0:0:25,53
that were in the skateboarding
and that kind of scene, and


6
0:0:25,53 --> 0:0:29,39
style and tricks, kind
of adapted over into


7
0:0:29,39 --> 0:0:30,42
snowboarding.


8
0:0:30,42 --> 0:0:30,93
DAVE DRISCOLL: Right out of the


9
0:0:30,93 --> 0:0:33,92
gates, Jeff was a standout.


10
0:0:33,92 --> 0:0:36,85
I mean, he pushed.


11
0:0:36,85 --> 0:0:40,64
He pushed the whole look and
style in snowboarding to a


12
0:0:40,64 --> 0:0:45,6
whole new level, just from his
attitude and the way he


13
0:0:45,6 --> 0:0:48,51
carried himself, to the
dreads to DJing, and


14
0:0:48,51 --> 0:0:50,64
then on-hill, obviously.


15
0:0:50,64 --> 0:0:53,97
He was one of the first people
to really bring that skate


16
0:0:53,97 --> 0:0:55,56
style into snowboarding.


17
0:0:55,56 --> 0:0:57,84
There could be other people
credited, too, like Noah


18
0:0:57,84 --> 0:1:0,97
Salasnek and others, but he
definitely pushed the limits,


19
0:1:0,97 --> 0:1:2,97
and style went a long way.


20
0:1:2,97 --> 0:1:4,42
PAT BRIDGES: People were getting
big airs, but they


21
0:1:4,42 --> 0:1:6,9
were traveling the pipe.


22
0:1:6,9 --> 0:1:8,58
Brushie actually brought it
really high, above the lip of


23
0:1:8,58 --> 0:1:10,65
the half pipe.


24
0:1:10,65 --> 0:1:13,1
The tricks he was doing were
like skateboarding at the


25
0:1:13,1 --> 0:1:14,86
time, like lip tricks.


26
0:1:14,86 --> 0:1:18,47
He was doing airs to disaster
and revert and stuff like that


27
0:1:18,47 --> 0:1:19,31
in the pipe.


28
0:1:19,31 --> 0:1:21,67
Brushie really brought
the tweak into it.


29
0:1:21,67 --> 0:1:24,35
PIERRE WIKBERG: Brushie
had a different style.


30
0:1:24,35 --> 0:1:28,3
He would just tweak more, and
he had his allie-oop threes


31
0:1:28,3 --> 0:1:31,2
that he would grab like mute
stiffy and poke them out.


32
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:33,29
And he just thought
differently.


33
0:1:33,29 --> 0:1:34,83
I thought he had more
interesting


34
0:1:34,83 --> 0:1:37,19
to watch than Terje.


35
0:1:37,19 --> 0:1:37,78
SHAUN WHITE: I remember--


36
0:1:37,78 --> 0:1:41,2
I mean, yeah, I always watched
him, and I don't think it was


37
0:1:41,2 --> 0:1:44,31
ever like will I
ever get there.


38
0:1:44,31 --> 0:1:44,92
You know what I mean?


39
0:1:44,92 --> 0:1:46,58
He was always just like how.


40
0:1:46,58 --> 0:1:47,73
How can I do that?


41
0:1:47,73 --> 0:1:49,24
Because I have to.


42
0:1:49,24 --> 0:1:50,28
I have to go as big as him.


43
0:1:50,28 --> 0:1:51,88
How do I do it?


44
0:1:51,88 --> 0:1:56,21
TREVOR ANDREW: He really was the
first one, to me, that was


45
0:1:56,21 --> 0:1:59,53
in the pipe busting.


46
0:1:59,53 --> 0:2:0,13
I don't know.


47
0:2:0,13 --> 0:2:2,85
He had that whole hip-hop
kind of flow.


48
0:2:2,85 --> 0:2:3,96
It was kind of crazy.


49
0:2:3,96 --> 0:2:7,11
He was the first one doing
that, it seemed like.


50
0:2:7,11 --> 0:2:10,972
And, yeah, just his style
was like nobody else's.


51
0:2:10,972 --> 0:2:12,94
TODD RICHARDS: In that old
video, "Chill," it was the


52
0:2:12,94 --> 0:2:16,8
first Burton video, Mike
Jacoby's like, I think that


53
0:2:16,8 --> 0:2:20,82
Brushie is killer rapper dude,
and it was like from that day


54
0:2:20,82 --> 0:2:23,39
on, he was the rap guy.


55
0:2:23,39 --> 0:2:26,48
At first, he'd just have
this weird Tony Hawk--


56
0:2:26,48 --> 0:2:29,3
like remember that flop,
that face flop?


57
0:2:29,3 --> 0:2:31,23
He had that, but
to the extreme.


58
0:2:31,23 --> 0:2:34,33
It was this big long thing, and
that just all of a sudden


59
0:2:34,33 --> 0:2:36,9
turned into dreadlocks at some
point, and then he was the


60
0:2:36,9 --> 0:2:38,3
dreadlock dude.


61
0:2:38,3 --> 0:2:46,28
Right at that time was NWA,
Eazy-E. Public Enemy was


62
0:2:46,28 --> 0:2:46,99
really big.


63
0:2:46,99 --> 0:2:52,8
And Brush was the first guy that
kind of rolled with that.


64
0:2:52,8 --> 0:2:53,14
TREVOR GRAVES: He'd always have
his tongue out, and he'd


65
0:2:53,14 --> 0:2:54,9
always have a runny nose.


66
0:2:54,9 --> 0:2:56,69
That was always a good
signal for Brush.


67
0:2:56,69 --> 0:2:59,55
I don't know what it was, just
always snot running out of


68
0:2:59,55 --> 0:3:2,32
that kid's mouth.


69
0:3:2,32 --> 0:3:4,0
KEVIN ENGLISH: Brushie'd get you
thinking about your facial


70
0:3:4,0 --> 0:3:5,375
expressions when you're
in the air.


71
0:3:5,375 --> 0:3:8,88
You know, you're like ugh, some
sort of crazy face while


72
0:3:8,88 --> 0:3:9,47
he's doing it.


73
0:3:9,47 --> 0:3:11,98
TREVOR GRAVES: What Jeff would
do is he's come up, and he'd


74
0:3:11,98 --> 0:3:13,99
look right at me.


75
0:3:13,99 --> 0:3:18,225
Throw a stalefish right into
the lens and land it.


76
0:3:18,225 --> 0:3:20,61
When you always concentrate on
the landing, you're thinking


77
0:3:20,61 --> 0:3:21,5
about what you're doing.


78
0:3:21,5 --> 0:3:23,42
He didn't have to.


79
0:3:23,42 --> 0:3:23,945
He's like a cat.


80
0:3:23,945 --> 0:3:25,5
He knew where he was
going to go.


81
0:3:25,5 --> 0:3:27,69
Woop, boop, done.


82
0:3:27,69 --> 0:3:29,5
KEIR DILLON: Everything
he did, he did with


83
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:31,24
just so much style.


84
0:3:31,24 --> 0:3:32,96
You'd see him at the US Open,
you'd go up, and you're like


85
0:3:32,96 --> 0:3:35,48
I'm buying that pant, I'm buying
that jacket, and I wish


86
0:3:35,48 --> 0:3:36,125
I could buy that board.


87
0:3:36,125 --> 0:3:41,26
And it was just crazy to look
back and to think that he had


88
0:3:41,26 --> 0:3:46,55
that power or control over, I
think, style and the influence


89
0:3:46,55 --> 0:3:49,74
of kids or us.


90
0:3:49,74 --> 0:3:52,31
TREVOR ANDREW: Yeah, the first
time I saw Brushie was at


91
0:3:52,31 --> 0:3:55,85
McDonald's, and I was just so
geeked that he was sitting


92
0:3:55,85 --> 0:3:57,46
across from me eating fries.


93
0:3:57,46 --> 0:3:58,59
You know what I mean?


94
0:3:58,59 --> 0:4:0,51
It was like, damn,
that's Brushie.


95
0:4:0,51 --> 0:4:2,73
Yeah, he was totally chill.


96
0:4:2,73 --> 0:4:6,3
It's amazing when you have
somebody that you feel that


97
0:4:6,3 --> 0:4:9,79
way about, when you meet them,
and they're actually cool.


98
0:4:9,79 --> 0:4:13,626
Yeah, he was like all time
favorite for me.


99
0:4:13,626 --> 0:4:16,69
For sure.


100
0:4:16,69 --> 0:4:18,5
JEFF BRUSHIE: I remember--


101
0:4:18,5 --> 0:4:21,82
I don't know when it was,
'87, '88, and I


102
0:4:21,82 --> 0:4:23,77
went to the US Open.


103
0:4:23,77 --> 0:4:26,2
I was probably only
15 or 16, so I had


104
0:4:26,2 --> 0:4:27,63
to race in the juniors.


105
0:4:27,63 --> 0:4:30,19
My dad brought me there
the first year.


106
0:4:30,19 --> 0:4:35,45
BOB: It was kind of new, and
he harped on us for weeks,


107
0:4:35,45 --> 0:4:36,27
months and whatever.


108
0:4:36,27 --> 0:4:36,77
KAREN: Mm-hmm.


109
0:4:36,77 --> 0:4:39,38
BOB: For a long time.


110
0:4:39,38 --> 0:4:41,27
We caved in, and I
took him down.


111
0:4:41,27 --> 0:4:42,6
He did pretty well.


112
0:4:42,6 --> 0:4:43,355
KAREN: Bob calls me
up on the phone.


113
0:4:43,355 --> 0:4:45,685
This thing is really
big, he goes.


114
0:4:45,685 --> 0:4:47,41
There's people here from
France and Japan.


115
0:4:47,41 --> 0:4:49,33
And I'm like, what, really?


116
0:4:49,33 --> 0:4:50,7
JEFF BRUSHIE: I totally
blew it.


117
0:4:50,7 --> 0:4:52,145
I didn't do good at all.


118
0:4:52,145 --> 0:4:56,35
So practiced up for the next
season, and then I came back.


119
0:4:56,35 --> 0:4:57,9
Maybe this was '88.


120
0:4:57,9 --> 0:5:3,42
And I did the slalom, and just
went as fast as I can, and I


121
0:5:3,42 --> 0:5:5,85
ended up winning by
eight seconds.


122
0:5:5,85 --> 0:5:10,6
And I remember Jake Burton was
down there near the finish


123
0:5:10,6 --> 0:5:13,56
line, and he came up to me and
shook my hand and stuff.


124
0:5:13,56 --> 0:5:15,76
And that was kind of
the beginning.


125
0:5:15,76 --> 0:5:20,6
Maybe like a year or the next
season after that, I was


126
0:5:20,6 --> 0:5:22,39
traveling around with
the Burton team.


127
0:5:22,39 --> 0:5:24,58
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER: Yeah,
Brush was a local kid that


128
0:5:24,58 --> 0:5:27,78
we'd see at Stratton, and
he'd come to the Open.


129
0:5:27,78 --> 0:5:29,1
You couldn't miss him.


130
0:5:29,1 --> 0:5:31,58
He just had so much style
right in the beginning.


131
0:5:31,58 --> 0:5:36,13
He went big, and he went big
sort of beyond his limits.


132
0:5:36,13 --> 0:5:38,57
And so when you'd see Brush
flying through the air, there


133
0:5:38,57 --> 0:5:41,6
was sort of this, well, is he
going to land this or not?


134
0:5:41,6 --> 0:5:42,8
I don't mean that as
a diss at all.


135
0:5:42,8 --> 0:5:45,58
I mean, the guy was incredible,
and he just had a


136
0:5:45,58 --> 0:5:50,99
lot of style and attitude, and
he had NWA blaring out of his


137
0:5:50,99 --> 0:5:52,44
car, I think, all the time.


138
0:5:52,44 --> 0:5:57,2
And he just really made things
fresh and had just a great


139
0:5:57,2 --> 0:5:58,725
spirit about him.


140
0:5:58,725 --> 0:6:1,21
JEFF BRUSHIE: The guys out
west had half pipe and


141
0:6:1,21 --> 0:6:6,24
freestyle contests for probably
a few years or more


142
0:6:6,24 --> 0:6:8,1
before we ever had
any of that.


143
0:6:8,1 --> 0:6:11,27
We all just raced gates
all the time on


144
0:6:11,27 --> 0:6:13,3
icy east coast slopes.


145
0:6:13,3 --> 0:6:16,39
We didn't have our first half
pipe until Tenney Mountain,


146
0:6:16,39 --> 0:6:19,46
New Hampshire, in 1987.


147
0:6:19,46 --> 0:6:21,27
TODD RICHARDS: That Tenney
contest was like the first


148
0:6:21,27 --> 0:6:24,375
time that any of the people from
around New England that


149
0:6:24,375 --> 0:6:26,13
had never--


150
0:6:26,13 --> 0:6:27,67
everyone had been doing the same
thing, but we were all


151
0:6:27,67 --> 0:6:31,14
brought together in one place
to see everyone else ride.


152
0:6:31,14 --> 0:6:33,23
It'd be like, oh, OK, so this is
what's going on in Vermont.


153
0:6:33,23 --> 0:6:34,13
I'm just in New Hampshire.


154
0:6:34,13 --> 0:6:35,47
I don't know what's going on.


155
0:6:35,47 --> 0:6:37,14
And you made all
these friends.


156
0:6:37,14 --> 0:6:41,83
JEFF BRUSHIE: Andy and Jack
Coghlan, Chris Carol, Todd


157
0:6:41,83 --> 0:6:43,97
Richards showed up.


158
0:6:43,97 --> 0:6:47,17
Might have been like six feet
high at the most, but mainly


159
0:6:47,17 --> 0:6:47,91
just banks.


160
0:6:47,91 --> 0:6:51,74
And it was really cool because,
at the bottom, it


161
0:6:51,74 --> 0:6:55,35
bowled out, so you could just
come down, do your tricks, and


162
0:6:55,35 --> 0:6:58,3
then point it, kind of like
a quarter pipe at the end.


163
0:6:58,3 --> 0:6:59,34
It was sick.


164
0:6:59,34 --> 0:7:2,82
I remember doing big old
suitcase methods at the end.


165
0:7:2,82 --> 0:7:4,945
TREVOR GRAVES: He just barreled
straight down the


166
0:7:4,945 --> 0:7:8,76
middle of the pipe, hit the
cul-de-sac at the bottom, and


167
0:7:8,76 --> 0:7:9,5
just boosted.


168
0:7:9,5 --> 0:7:13,9
So he popped out, probably by
that time, six, seven feet,


169
0:7:13,9 --> 0:7:16,58
which is pretty big suitcase
air, and landed it.


170
0:7:16,58 --> 0:7:17,61
That won the contest.


171
0:7:17,61 --> 0:7:19,68
That's all he needed to do.


172
0:7:19,68 --> 0:7:21,65
TODD RICHARDS: Burton had the
foresight to be like, OK,


173
0:7:21,65 --> 0:7:24,45
we're going to put some effort
behind this kid, and next


174
0:7:24,45 --> 0:7:27,29
thing you know, Brushie's
traveling with the crew.


175
0:7:27,29 --> 0:7:30,28
And he's with Craig and riding
with Craig all the time, and


176
0:7:30,28 --> 0:7:32,9
he just got better and
better and better.


177
0:7:32,9 --> 0:7:34,94
And we're like, holy shit,
dude, this kid--


178
0:7:34,94 --> 0:7:35,51
what happened?


179
0:7:35,51 --> 0:7:39,9
Like he got really crazy good,
and we're like wow, OK.


180
0:7:39,9 --> 0:7:42,23
Well, we need to kind
of step our shit up.


181
0:7:42,23 --> 0:7:47,4
JEFF BRUSHIE: There was a time
when people wanted you to race


182
0:7:47,4 --> 0:7:48,53
and freestyle.


183
0:7:48,53 --> 0:7:53,33
There was a few guys like me,
Craig, Terje, who we just


184
0:7:53,33 --> 0:7:54,68
wanted to freestyle.


185
0:7:54,68 --> 0:7:57,3
We just wanted to ride
pipes and stuff.


186
0:7:57,3 --> 0:8:0,76
There's actually a photo of me
doing a method in the middle


187
0:8:0,76 --> 0:8:2,8
of a race course.


188
0:8:2,8 --> 0:8:4,78
I had to go through the race
course just for overall


189
0:8:4,78 --> 0:8:7,63
points, so I just
messed around.


190
0:8:7,63 --> 0:8:10,6
For a while, they just kind of
looked at us like we were the


191
0:8:10,6 --> 0:8:14,3
oddballs, and a few
years after that,


192
0:8:14,3 --> 0:8:16,5
freestyle's the thing.


193
0:8:16,5 --> 0:8:17,69
KEIR DILLON: There are certain
people, I think, and he's one


194
0:8:17,69 --> 0:8:20,25
of them, that literally dictated
where a sport could


195
0:8:20,25 --> 0:8:22,13
have gone, or where
it ended up.


196
0:8:22,13 --> 0:8:24,5
And just his style and attitude
and keeping it fresh


197
0:8:24,5 --> 0:8:29,6
and fun and very standoffish of
the mainstream at the time


198
0:8:29,6 --> 0:8:31,9
really dictated where
the sport was going.


199
0:8:31,9 --> 0:8:35,0
And it's people like that that
showed you can make a living


200
0:8:35,0 --> 0:8:37,809
and have fun and live your
expression and dreams through


201
0:8:37,809 --> 0:8:40,83
the freestyle aspect, and the
racing doesn't need to be a


202
0:8:40,83 --> 0:8:42,96
part of it.


203
0:8:42,96 --> 0:8:44,54
JEFF BRUSHIE: It worked
out for us.


204
0:8:44,54 --> 0:8:48,44
I think the popularity with the
freestyle growing after


205
0:8:48,44 --> 0:8:51,2
just the first couple years
hooked us up, and


206
0:8:51,2 --> 0:8:53,87
we got what we wanted.


207
0:8:53,87 --> 0:8:55,12
No more racing.


208
0:8:55,12 --> 0:8:57,35



209
0:8:57,35 --> 0:8:58,135
KAREN: Hi, I'm Karen.


210
0:8:58,135 --> 0:9:0,37
I'm Jeff Brushie's mom.


211
0:9:0,37 --> 0:9:3,46
BOB: And I'm Bob, Jeff
Brushie's dad.


212
0:9:3,46 --> 0:9:6,35
DONNA CARPENTER: His mom was
always on the side cheering


213
0:9:6,35 --> 0:9:10,48
for him, and I think she was
the first snowboard mom.


214
0:9:10,48 --> 0:9:12,17
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER: I think
she was one of the first sort


215
0:9:12,17 --> 0:9:15,41
of snowboarding moms,
but he ran the show.


216
0:9:15,41 --> 0:9:17,8
I mean, he was funny.


217
0:9:17,8 --> 0:9:18,17
He called his own shots.


218
0:9:18,17 --> 0:9:21,21
Nobody was really telling
Jeff what to do.


219
0:9:21,21 --> 0:9:24,89
KAREN: And this is
his old room.


220
0:9:24,89 --> 0:9:26,56
It was his cave.


221
0:9:26,56 --> 0:9:30,47
He had all of his bibs
all the way around.


222
0:9:30,47 --> 0:9:32,625
A water bed he would
not get rid of.


223
0:9:32,625 --> 0:9:34,61
I'm serious.


224
0:9:34,61 --> 0:9:37,31
[INAUDIBLE] room with
a lot of junk.


225
0:9:37,31 --> 0:9:41,96
Those, I believe, are Trevor
Graves shots, and this was the


226
0:9:41,96 --> 0:9:43,44
first competition.


227
0:9:43,44 --> 0:9:44,82
This was 1990.


228
0:9:44,82 --> 0:9:48,22
This is '91, was the year,
I believe, he did the


229
0:9:48,22 --> 0:9:49,25
overall World Cup.


230
0:9:49,25 --> 0:9:51,11
Yeah.


231
0:9:51,11 --> 0:9:54,77
I was cleaning out that
snowboard bench, and I


232
0:9:54,77 --> 0:9:56,54
happened to open the drawer
to see what was in there.


233
0:9:56,54 --> 0:9:59,38
There was a hacky sack
and a bag of dreads.


234
0:9:59,38 --> 0:10:1,63
Honest to God, I will
find those.


235
0:10:1,63 --> 0:10:3,9
I will find those for you.


236
0:10:3,9 --> 0:10:5,855
I went, Jeff, I have
your dreads.


237
0:10:5,855 --> 0:10:6,29
I did.


238
0:10:6,29 --> 0:10:7,17
I told him I had his dreads.


239
0:10:7,17 --> 0:10:14,545
He goes, "Nice." Oh,
the dreadlocks.


240
0:10:14,545 --> 0:10:16,41
I'll take them out for you.


241
0:10:16,41 --> 0:10:20,57
I don't know, I probably need
to wash my hands after I do.


242
0:10:20,57 --> 0:10:24,64
I cut them, and years
went by, years.


243
0:10:24,64 --> 0:10:28,97
Here's the dreads, nasty dreads,
or natty dreads,


244
0:10:28,97 --> 0:10:30,56
whatever you want
to call them.


245
0:10:30,56 --> 0:10:34,675
And it took him a long time
to get those perfect.


246
0:10:34,675 --> 0:10:37,76
The wall is his collection
of stickers.


247
0:10:37,76 --> 0:10:40,39
I've changed a lot of things,
but I will not change this


248
0:10:40,39 --> 0:10:41,79
wall until we move.


249
0:10:41,79 --> 0:10:43,8
I won't.


250
0:10:43,8 --> 0:10:44,68
It's got meaning.


251
0:10:44,68 --> 0:10:47,45
It's part of the house, now.


252
0:10:47,45 --> 0:10:50,4
And all his stuff has stayed
where he has hung it.


253
0:10:50,4 --> 0:10:52,94
There's Craig Kelly.


254
0:10:52,94 --> 0:10:55,66
He idolized Craig,
he really did.


255
0:10:55,66 --> 0:10:59,16
And there's Shaun Palmer's
balloon.


256
0:10:59,16 --> 0:11:1,626
And he just kept adding to it.


257
0:11:1,626 --> 0:11:2,91
BOB: He loved McDonalds.


258
0:11:2,91 --> 0:11:5,49
KAREN: Loved--


259
0:11:5,49 --> 0:11:8,46
That came from Japan, I think.


260
0:11:8,46 --> 0:11:10,13
Loved McDonald's.


261
0:11:10,13 --> 0:11:13,9
But these are some
of the checks.


262
0:11:13,9 --> 0:11:16,56
This, Nissan Snowboard Tour.


263
0:11:16,56 --> 0:11:18,3
What position, I'm not
sure because it


264
0:11:18,3 --> 0:11:19,73
doesn't have it on there.


265
0:11:19,73 --> 0:11:21,78
They stuck him on there,
obviously.


266
0:11:21,78 --> 0:11:29,94
And this was in 1992 when he won
the national competition,


267
0:11:29,94 --> 0:11:32,661
and his prize was that truck.


268
0:11:32,661 --> 0:11:34,93
I'm assuming that these
were first places


269
0:11:34,93 --> 0:11:36,43
because he won it overall.


270
0:11:36,43 --> 0:11:37,71
Unless--


271
0:11:37,71 --> 0:11:41,4
no, the $1,000 ones could
have been second place.


272
0:11:41,4 --> 0:11:44,17
World Pro Snowboard
Tour, Get Twisted.


273
0:11:44,17 --> 0:11:47,12
That was fun.


274
0:11:47,12 --> 0:11:49,415
1998.


275
0:11:49,415 --> 0:11:51,81
It was fancy.


276
0:11:51,81 --> 0:11:53,1
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER: It was
tough for him because he was


277
0:11:53,1 --> 0:11:56,21
not really a competitor
by nature.


278
0:11:56,21 --> 0:12:0,25
He was just almost too
sensitive, too nice a guy, and


279
0:12:0,25 --> 0:12:2,2
I know the Open was a really
tough event for him.


280
0:12:2,2 --> 0:12:4,15
All of his friends were there.


281
0:12:4,15 --> 0:12:4,73
He never won there.


282
0:12:4,73 --> 0:12:6,42
He never rode particularly
well there.


283
0:12:6,42 --> 0:12:8,35
I think it was just too much.


284
0:12:8,35 --> 0:12:10,73
You get wrapped up in all the
social stuff going on and


285
0:12:10,73 --> 0:12:11,45
everything.


286
0:12:11,45 --> 0:12:14,7
KAREN: And a lot of people
actually thought he was an


287
0:12:14,7 --> 0:12:18,64
arrogant person because he
wouldn't really sometimes


288
0:12:18,64 --> 0:12:20,0
acknowledge things.


289
0:12:20,0 --> 0:12:22,38
But he was actually shy.


290
0:12:22,38 --> 0:12:26,55
So that was a real misconception
about him.


291
0:12:26,55 --> 0:12:31,68
What we did was when he first
started winning contests, we


292
0:12:31,68 --> 0:12:34,38
basically said to him, because
he had been known to like, I


293
0:12:34,38 --> 0:12:38,2
want to be a BMX biker, all
this, and he did well with


294
0:12:38,2 --> 0:12:40,14
that, but he never did
any competitions.


295
0:12:40,14 --> 0:12:42,6
So we said to him, well--


296
0:12:42,6 --> 0:12:45,19
I mean, we didn't have a whole
ton of money at that time to


297
0:12:45,19 --> 0:12:49,93
send him all around the world,
but we said, well, you set


298
0:12:49,93 --> 0:12:53,75
some goals, and when you achieve
one, you can go after


299
0:12:53,75 --> 0:12:54,79
another one.


300
0:12:54,79 --> 0:12:59,47
So he started winning all these
contests, and then when


301
0:12:59,47 --> 0:13:3,11
Burton picked him up--
obviously, to me, I mean, if


302
0:13:3,11 --> 0:13:5,36
this was his calling, this
was his calling.


303
0:13:5,36 --> 0:13:8,3
I mean, he didn't have to become
a doctor or lawyer.


304
0:13:8,3 --> 0:13:10,54
He was making more money
than his teachers.


305
0:13:10,54 --> 0:13:12,77
And I knew it was short lived,
but I knew he could


306
0:13:12,77 --> 0:13:14,1
take it far, too.


307
0:13:14,1 --> 0:13:16,49
But we're very proud of him.


308
0:13:16,49 --> 0:13:18,12
It was really fun.


309
0:13:18,12 --> 0:13:20,13
I miss it.


310
0:13:20,13 --> 0:13:24,13
I miss having Jeff here, so we
have to get him to move a


311
0:13:24,13 --> 0:13:26,62
little closer, bring the kids.


312
0:13:26,62 --> 0:13:34,15



313
0:13:34,15 --> 0:13:38,49
TODD KOHLMAN: This is one of
my personal favorites, the


314
0:13:38,49 --> 0:13:40,43
1993 Jeff Brushie.


315
0:13:40,43 --> 0:13:44,9
Very classic Vermont style with
the trout, and of course,


316
0:13:44,9 --> 0:13:48,79
the base, the skeleton
of the fish.


317
0:13:48,79 --> 0:13:51,58
BOB: And it's still in the
place that he hung it.


318
0:13:51,58 --> 0:13:54,28
JEFF BRUSHIE: Well, one
of the most popular is


319
0:13:54,28 --> 0:13:56,5
the very first one.


320
0:13:56,5 --> 0:13:59,5
That was my least favorite
graphic, too.


321
0:13:59,5 --> 0:14:5,49
My mind wasn't totally working
in the graphic mode yet, and I


322
0:14:5,49 --> 0:14:7,92
think somebody kind pitched
the idea to me.


323
0:14:7,92 --> 0:14:13,11
And I went with the fish because
I was a Vermont kid,


324
0:14:13,11 --> 0:14:16,4
so it's kind of like the country
and fishing and stuff.


325
0:14:16,4 --> 0:14:19,54
So I kind of put the fish on
there for that kind of thing,


326
0:14:19,54 --> 0:14:23,53
and then the bottom was my kind
of deal, where I did the


327
0:14:23,53 --> 0:14:25,38
fish skeleton on the
whole base of the


328
0:14:25,38 --> 0:14:27,76
board, and my name.


329
0:14:27,76 --> 0:14:31,84
I kind of got influenced with
that from Mark Gonzalez


330
0:14:31,84 --> 0:14:34,8
skateboards back in the day.


331
0:14:34,8 --> 0:14:35,52
JAKE BURTON CARPENTER: There
was a great story about--


332
0:14:35,52 --> 0:14:39,28
I remember some dealer was
coming to our booth in Vegas,


333
0:14:39,28 --> 0:14:40,22
and he's ordering.


334
0:14:40,22 --> 0:14:43,47
I'll take 14 customs, this and
that, and he goes, "And give


335
0:14:43,47 --> 0:14:47,21
me 50 of that one with the fish
on it." And I was like--


336
0:14:47,21 --> 0:14:48,69
the dealers, they didn't
even who he was.


337
0:14:48,69 --> 0:14:51,29
It was like that board
with the fish on it.


338
0:14:51,29 --> 0:14:54,63
That was a very popular sig
board, and sig boards are


339
0:14:54,63 --> 0:14:56,3
really happening at the time.


340
0:14:56,3 --> 0:14:58,37
But just this rainbow
trout, great board.


341
0:14:58,37 --> 0:15:1,36
I mean, it was super well made
and designed and very light,


342
0:15:1,36 --> 0:15:2,91
lighter than anything else that
had been made at that


343
0:15:2,91 --> 0:15:5,3
point in time.


344
0:15:5,3 --> 0:15:8,3
And it was a great shape, and he
was riding incredibly well,


345
0:15:8,3 --> 0:15:11,81
and it just reeked of
him and of Vermont.


346
0:15:11,81 --> 0:15:16,38
It was just a winning graphic,
a standout for sure.


347
0:15:16,38 --> 0:15:19,32
JEFF BRUSHIE: See, on
the original, that's


348
0:15:19,32 --> 0:15:21,5
where my name was.


349
0:15:21,5 --> 0:15:25,1
Yeah, somebody did it up for
me and sent it to me.


350
0:15:25,1 --> 0:15:26,19
JEFF CURTES: That's the cool
thing about Burton.


351
0:15:26,19 --> 0:15:27,32
All those little--


352
0:15:27,32 --> 0:15:29,455
they really do a good job of
listening to the riders and


353
0:15:29,455 --> 0:15:31,92
letting the riders take whatever
ideas they have and


354
0:15:31,92 --> 0:15:35,4
scribbled on a napkin, and
literally, those ideas turn


355
0:15:35,4 --> 0:15:38,75
into product development.


356
0:15:38,75 --> 0:15:41,85
I'm sure Brushie, his first
shape that he made--


357
0:15:41,85 --> 0:15:43,59
it's probably better for him to
talk about his first board,


358
0:15:43,59 --> 0:15:45,66
but was entirely different than
anything that Burton had


359
0:15:45,66 --> 0:15:47,58
put out before.


360
0:15:47,58 --> 0:15:50,105
TODD KOHLMAN: Look at the shape,
very blunt nose and


361
0:15:50,105 --> 0:15:52,45
tail compared to,
like, this here.


362
0:15:52,45 --> 0:15:56,9
You get more of a twin, and
yeah, it's just breakthrough.


363
0:15:56,9 --> 0:15:59,66
'93 was when we went to the
three hole, the 3D.


364
0:15:59,66 --> 0:16:2,36
So you had, here, the five-hole,
you had limited


365
0:16:2,36 --> 0:16:3,41
stance options.


366
0:16:3,41 --> 0:16:7,285
And a whole new ball game, and
Jeff was a huge part of that


367
0:16:7,285 --> 0:16:9,89
with rider development.


368
0:16:9,89 --> 0:16:14,83
JEFF BRUSHIE: This is my second
snowboard I ever owned.


369
0:16:14,83 --> 0:16:18,25
First one didn't have metal
edges, so this was kind of


370
0:16:18,25 --> 0:16:21,37
like the first real
snowboard I had.


371
0:16:21,37 --> 0:16:27,29
I think I won the junior slalom
on it at the US Open.


372
0:16:27,29 --> 0:16:33,75
TODD KOHLMAN: This cruiser '86
here, Jeff later in '95 had a


373
0:16:33,75 --> 0:16:38,68
pro model that was the same
graphic, but it was more of a


374
0:16:38,68 --> 0:16:39,7
twin shape.


375
0:16:39,7 --> 0:16:41,772
But it's awesome, definitely.


376
0:16:41,772 --> 0:16:45,75
JEFF BRUSHIE: And an old, one of
my pro models and the board


377
0:16:45,75 --> 0:16:48,18
that we copied, the original.


378
0:16:48,18 --> 0:16:51,28
It was really probably
one of my favorites.


379
0:16:51,28 --> 0:16:53,9
DAVE DRISCOLL: Jeff just kind of
always figured out what was


380
0:16:53,9 --> 0:16:56,72
cool, and his graphics
were always like the


381
0:16:56,72 --> 0:16:57,94
hot shit, for sure.


382
0:16:57,94 --> 0:17:0,73
KEIR DILLON: My memories of
Brush was the first fish board


383
0:17:0,73 --> 0:17:2,215
that he had, which was
just ridiculous.


384
0:17:2,215 --> 0:17:6,15
And then he came out with the
graffiti art board, and then


385
0:17:6,15 --> 0:17:7,77
the dice board.


386
0:17:7,77 --> 0:17:11,21
JEFF BRUSHIE: My very last
board with Burton was the


387
0:17:11,21 --> 0:17:14,329
craps table, and then
I kept the gambling


388
0:17:14,329 --> 0:17:16,17
thing going with Ride.


389
0:17:16,17 --> 0:17:18,3
I always liked to gamble.


390
0:17:18,3 --> 0:17:21,27
I've always been into playing
poker and stuff, so I think


391
0:17:21,27 --> 0:17:23,329
that has a lot to
do with it, too.


392
0:17:23,329 --> 0:17:28,261
But I just think a lot of people
like that kind of vibe,


393
0:17:28,261 --> 0:17:31,31
and I thought it would
work cool on boards.


394
0:17:31,31 --> 0:17:35,92
Burton made this, the board,
into a real craps table with


395
0:17:35,92 --> 0:17:39,27
sides, and I was like can
I take the craps table?


396
0:17:39,27 --> 0:17:45,66
And I had this idea, got my
buddies bow ties, and it ended


397
0:17:45,66 --> 0:17:47,18
up being a cool shot.


398
0:17:47,18 --> 0:17:49,31
This is no Photoshop at all.


399
0:17:49,31 --> 0:17:52,51
That's the actual dice.


400
0:17:52,51 --> 0:17:56,1
That shot's just a different
shot of me somewhere in a half


401
0:17:56,1 --> 0:18:0,51
pipe, but it looked so cool,
they made it into an ad.


402
0:18:0,51 --> 0:18:2,96
KEIR DILLON: Knowing him, the
gambling is classic shots,


403
0:18:2,96 --> 0:18:6,36
like the ads of the rat
pack around his board.


404
0:18:6,36 --> 0:18:8,14
I'm a big gambler, and
he's a big gambler.


405
0:18:8,14 --> 0:18:10,36
And he'll get us into some
celebrity tournaments and


406
0:18:10,36 --> 0:18:11,64
stuff with Phil Ivy in it.


407
0:18:11,64 --> 0:18:15,55
It's dope because he's like--
just to see him,


408
0:18:15,55 --> 0:18:16,29
how he's moved on.


409
0:18:16,29 --> 0:18:18,25
He's shooting photos, but
still the same Brush.


410
0:18:18,25 --> 0:18:21,26
And you hear his voice,
and like, ah, it kind


411
0:18:21,26 --> 0:18:22,81
of brings you back.


412
0:18:22,81 --> 0:18:27,8
DAVE DRISCOLL: Craps board's
kind of like a foresight into


413
0:18:27,8 --> 0:18:28,69
him being into gambling
for the last--


414
0:18:28,69 --> 0:18:29,86
he's not a heavy gambler.


415
0:18:29,86 --> 0:18:31,42
He's really smart with
this money, for sure.


416
0:18:31,42 --> 0:18:35,71
But he definitely enjoys going
to the bright lights of Vegas


417
0:18:35,71 --> 0:18:37,67
and playing some cards.


418
0:18:37,67 --> 0:18:39,56
JEFF BRUSHIE: Rob Gracie,
he used to shoot me a


419
0:18:39,56 --> 0:18:40,91
lot back in the day.


420
0:18:40,91 --> 0:18:42,7
That's how we met.


421
0:18:42,7 --> 0:18:46,52
And he met this guy who had
the contract with Harrah's


422
0:18:46,52 --> 0:18:51,8
Casinos to be the official
photographers of the World


423
0:18:51,8 --> 0:18:52,83
Series of Poker.


424
0:18:52,83 --> 0:18:56,95
They took me on, and I got the
hang of it right off the bat,


425
0:18:56,95 --> 0:18:57,71
and it was fun.


426
0:18:57,71 --> 0:19:1,68
I love poker, so you're around
all the biggest poker guys


427
0:19:1,68 --> 0:19:4,26
around and checking them
out, seeing what they


428
0:19:4,26 --> 0:19:5,57
do, shooting them.


429
0:19:5,57 --> 0:19:6,39
It was fun.


430
0:19:6,39 --> 0:19:9,9
I did that for a couple years,
and this year I actually


431
0:19:9,9 --> 0:19:12,1
didn't do it.


432
0:19:12,1 --> 0:19:15,4
A little harder now with the
little kids running around,


433
0:19:15,4 --> 0:19:19,1
but it was really cool.


434
0:19:19,1 --> 0:19:22,17
Here comes a little
Mini-Brushie.


435
0:19:22,17 --> 0:19:23,9
Come here, Mini-Brushie.


436
0:19:23,9 --> 0:19:24,6
Come here.


437
0:19:24,6 --> 0:19:25,44
ARABELLA: Hello.


438
0:19:25,44 --> 0:19:27,82
JEFF BRUSHIE: Oh, you
got boots on?


439
0:19:27,82 --> 0:19:28,555
ARABELLA: Yes.


440
0:19:28,555 --> 0:19:33,6
JEFF BRUSHIE: Here, come over
here and sit with me.


441
0:19:33,6 --> 0:19:35,9
Hey, Arabella, do you
want a snowboard?


442
0:19:35,9 --> 0:19:36,44
ARABELLA: Uh-huh.


443
0:19:36,44 --> 0:19:38,1
JEFF BRUSHIE: You do?


444
0:19:38,1 --> 0:19:39,86
Woo.


445
0:19:39,86 --> 0:19:42,94
INTERVIEWER: How old does she
have to be to snowboard?


446
0:19:42,94 --> 0:19:43,65
JEFF BRUSHIE: I don't know.


447
0:19:43,65 --> 0:19:44,546
She has a snowboard.


448
0:19:44,546 --> 0:19:45,3
INTERVIEWER: Yeah?


449
0:19:45,3 --> 0:19:47,53
JEFF BRUSHIE: She has a little
one, but she was scared to


450
0:19:47,53 --> 0:19:50,4
stand on it in Tahoe.


451
0:19:50,4 --> 0:19:54,68
But she finally standed on it
because I told her I'd give


452
0:19:54,68 --> 0:19:58,0
her candy, and I wanted
to take a photo.


453
0:19:58,0 --> 0:20:0,59
Right, remember that?


454
0:20:0,59 --> 0:20:3,38
You stood on the snowboard,
and I gave you candy.


455
0:20:3,38 --> 0:20:6,78
This year, you've got to put
the bindings on and go down


456
0:20:6,78 --> 0:20:11,694
the hill and fall, and then
I give you candy.


457
0:20:11,694 --> 0:20:13,47
ARABELLA: I fall down?


458
0:20:13,47 --> 0:20:15,25
JEFF BRUSHIE: Yeah, that's
what happens.


459
0:20:15,25 --> 0:20:16,52
You fall.


460
0:20:16,52 --> 0:20:18,39
You got to fall to learn.


461
0:20:18,39 --> 0:20:19,23
Right?


462
0:20:19,23 --> 0:20:20,48
ARABELLA: [INAUDIBLE]


463
0:20:20,48 --> 0:20:22,9



464
0:20:22,9 --> 0:20:24,543
JEFF BRUSHIE: Oh,
you fell down.


465
0:20:24,543 --> 0:20:25,52
ARABELLA: Yeah.


466
0:20:25,52 --> 0:20:28,5
JEFF BRUSHIE: Kind of like you
were snowboarding, huh.


467
0:20:28,5 --> 0:20:29,55
Woosh!


468
0:20:29,55 --> 0:20:31,65
[SCREAMS AND LAUGHS]


469
0:20:31,65 --> 0:22:31,65
