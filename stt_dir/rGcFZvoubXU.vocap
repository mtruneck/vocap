###17 MICHAEL HOLSTINE: We're standing on top of level four
###20 of the Green Bank Telescope, the largest fully steerable
###24 radio telescope in the world.
###27 We're standing directly under the reflector for the main
###30 structure, which is 2.4 acres in size.
###35 
###48 KAREN O'NEIL: Radio astronomy started back in
###50 the 1920s and '30s.
###52 It really got its start when people were surveying the
###54 radio sky to understand noise that they were seeing within
###57 their own radio observations.
###58 And they began to realize that that radio noise was actually
###61 coming from outer space, from the sun, from the stars, and
###64 from the distant galaxies that we see out there.
###66 And so with that became the field of radio astronomy.
###68 And that grew and grew until eventually, in the 1950s--
###72 1956--
###73 the United States realized that if we were going to be a
###75 player in this new field of science, we needed to build a
###78 national radio astronomy facility.
###81 When they decided to build a national radio astronomy
###83 facility, they began looking around the country to
###86 determine where the best site for that facility would be.
###89 And they had a lot of different
###90 criteria in that decision.
###91 But one of the biggest, and possibly most important in the
###94 long run, was they wanted an area where radio frequency
###97 interference was minimal.
###98 MICHAEL HOLSTINE: You can imagine, in 1958 there were no
###102 wireless communications to speak of.
###105 But in the last 10 to 15 years, wireless
###109 technology has exploded.
###111 Everyone has a cell phone.
###113 And now simply because the telescope is so sensitive
###117 that, for instance, your cell phone that you're so attached
###120 to, if it, alone, that single cell phone, were placed on
###125 Mars, for instance, it would be the brightest radio object
###128 in the sky to us.
###130 So we have to figure out a way to allow communications,
###134 particularly for emergency medical purposes, and still
###139 protect the data that the observer is trying to receive.
###142 
###159 So from this point on, beyond this gate, we require that a
###163 diesel engine only travel down here.
###167 And you can see the "no spark plug" sign.
###172 We design, build, and run these extremely
###177 technologically advanced instruments.
###180 But here, on site, we can't use the technology that
###184 everyone else is used to using.
###187 We don't have cellphones.
###188 We don't have microwave ovens.
###190 
###193 There are a few people that are upset that they can't have
###198 the conveniences that maybe their aunt and
###203 uncle in Ohio have.
###206 But again, we try to find a way to work with those people
###210 to provide them what they would like to have without
###214 having the wireless be part of it.

###224 KAREN O'NEIL: When the GBT came along, it's not just very
###226 sensitive, but it has a very wide frequency range.
###229 That is, we can look at wavelengths from many, many
###232 meters down to things that are just three millimeters in
###235 wavelength, so very, very small.
###237 And with that came the idea of well, let's just use this
###239 incredibly sensitive telescope with its incredibly wide
###242 frequency range and go see what we could find out there.
###244 So they pointed the telescope into areas where you can
###246 expect to find complex molecules, like
###248 star formation areas.
###250 And they found very, very complex molecules, more
###252 complex than anybody would have imagined, up to very
###254 basic sugars in space.
###255 So that tells us that the building blocks of life are
###257 everywhere out there.
###259 As Douglas Adams said, the universe is huge.
###263 It's mind-bogglingly huge.
###266 And we're already discovering stars that have other
###269 planetary systems, very much like our own Earth, here in
###273 our own galaxy.
###275 There absolutely is life out there.
###278 I would even go as far to say as I think there's intelligent
###282 life out there.
###286 KAREN O'NEIL: The bigger question is, even if the
###288 universe is teeming with intelligent life, are we going
###290 to be able to detect it in our lifetime?
###292 That's an incredibly difficult feat to do.
###294 
###299 MICHAEL HOLSTINE: We are, with a certain suite of instruments
###303 here right now, at least trying to reach back to
###308 milliseconds after the Big Bang occurred.
###310 And we're looking at the epic of re-ionization, when there
###316 started to be a coalescence of material.
###320 Once you have star creation, you have a long laundry list
###326 of things that, at least for us, end up into human
###331 creation, because we're all made of the stuff that the
###335 stars produce.
###337 So it's a very interesting thing to watch.
###341 I really think there was something before
###343 the Big Bang, too.
###345 I think that there may have been many big bangs, because
###351 the logic, for me, is there that it occurred.
###357 Every day, people here think about those possibilities, not
###363 just whether it's possible, but how do I go about proving
###368 that that's a possibility?
###370 And the instruments that are here allow a lot of that work
###375 to be done.
