1
0:0:8,64 --> 0:0:10,93
Thank you so much.


2
0:0:10,93 --> 0:0:16,86
So I'd like to start my story in 1997
when I first came to the US.


3
0:0:16,86 --> 0:0:19,31
I was originally working with adult women.


4
0:0:19,31 --> 0:0:23,6
I came originally to work with adult women
coming out of the sex industry.


5
0:0:23,6 --> 0:0:27,4
And so in that first literally few days,
few weeks, few months,


6
0:0:27,4 --> 0:0:31,64
I began to go to Rikers Island Prison
and up to Hunts Point,


7
0:0:31,64 --> 0:0:36,38
which has been the subject of
numerous pseudodocumentaries on HBO,


8
0:0:36,38 --> 0:0:40,13
and began to meet really young girls.


9
0:0:40,13 --> 0:0:43,39
I was going into
an adult correctional facility


10
0:0:43,39 --> 0:0:46,2
and yet meeting 12, 13, 14-year-old girls


11
0:0:46,2 --> 0:0:50,79
who'd been told by their pimp
to say that they were 17, 18, 19.


12
0:0:50,79 --> 0:0:54,38
It was incredibly obvious that
they were nowhere close to that age.


13
0:0:54,38 --> 0:0:57,9
I was going out on to the streets,


14
0:0:57,9 --> 0:1:0,74
and for any of you who've seen
any of those HBO type docs,


15
0:1:0,74 --> 0:1:2,68
you know that for many, many years,


16
0:1:2,68 --> 0:1:6,74
there's been areas in New York and
in Chicago and all over the country


17
0:1:6,74 --> 0:1:10,5
where there's a very, very clear
kind of prostitution track.


18
0:1:10,5 --> 0:1:15,14
And so there would be cars
literally lined up on the street,


19
0:1:15,14 --> 0:1:18,2
and I would meet yet again
12, 13, 14-year-old girls


20
0:1:18,2 --> 0:1:19,94
who were out there being sold.


21
0:1:19,94 --> 0:1:23,44
And so, I was 22
when I first came to the States,


22
0:1:23,44 --> 0:1:26,506
and as a survivor
of commercial sexual exploitation myself


23
0:1:26,506 --> 0:1:29,97
as a teenager --
I'd gotten out when I was 19 years old --


24
0:1:29,97 --> 0:1:32,96
I've realized that I had
a lot in common with these girls


25
0:1:32,96 --> 0:1:35,27
and young women that I was meeting.


26
0:1:35,27 --> 0:1:37,93
And the 40-year-old women
at that point were like:


27
0:1:37,93 --> 0:1:40,47
What's this little girl going to tell me?


28
0:1:40,47 --> 0:1:42,87
Whereas the 19-year-olds
were a little bit more receptive


29
0:1:42,87 --> 0:1:45,32
to this very bright-eyed 22-year-old.


30
0:1:45,32 --> 0:1:49,19
So I realized though, that even though
we were from different continents,


31
0:1:49,19 --> 0:1:51,59
and the girls would be like:
Where's your accent, miss?


32
0:1:51,59 --> 0:1:54,51
You sound like Sporty Spice --


33
0:1:54,51 --> 0:1:57,57
that we had very, very similar stories,


34
0:1:57,57 --> 0:2:2,14
and that cultural difference
was kind of overridden


35
0:2:2,14 --> 0:2:6,89
by the similarities
of the commercial sex industry globally.


36
0:2:6,89 --> 0:2:10,43
And so our stories
of growing up in poverty,


37
0:2:10,43 --> 0:2:13,17
our stories of growing up
in traumatic homes


38
0:2:13,17 --> 0:2:16,39
where there was lots of domestic violence
and substance abuse,


39
0:2:16,39 --> 0:2:20,47
our stories of craving attention and love


40
0:2:20,47 --> 0:2:22,79
from our families and generally
not getting that,


41
0:2:22,79 --> 0:2:27,35
our stories of kind of getting introduced
into the commercial sex industry


42
0:2:27,35 --> 0:2:31,59
through a man or through kind of
this moment of desperation


43
0:2:31,59 --> 0:2:34,91
and feeling like: OK, this is
just something I'll do for the moment,


44
0:2:34,91 --> 0:2:38,38
and I'll figure out my way to get out.
And then getting stuck.


45
0:2:38,38 --> 0:2:42,6
And our stories of being treated like
"we were less than"


46
0:2:42,6 --> 0:2:46,31
by everyone in the community:
our families, by law enforcement,


47
0:2:46,31 --> 0:2:48,63
by social workers, by hospital staff.


48
0:2:48,63 --> 0:2:52,67
They kind of rang the same,
whether it was my experience,


49
0:2:52,67 --> 0:2:55,0
or the experiences
of the girls that I was serving.


50
0:2:55,0 --> 0:2:57,82
And so, in 1998, I decided to start GEMS,


51
0:2:57,82 --> 0:3:0,31
which is
Girls Educational and Mentoring Services,


52
0:3:0,31 --> 0:3:2,2
kind of based on my own experiences.


53
0:3:2,2 --> 0:3:4,13
And at that point, I had
absolutely no money,


54
0:3:4,13 --> 0:3:6,14
I had no idea even how to write...


55
0:3:6,14 --> 0:3:8,94
I think I was just beginning
to learn how to write a proposal.


56
0:3:8,94 --> 0:3:12,37
And so, I started GEMS
literally on my kitchen table,


57
0:3:12,37 --> 0:3:15,64
and girls would sleep on my couch,
and eat my food,


58
0:3:15,64 --> 0:3:18,6
and wear my clothes,
and not bring my clothes back.


59
0:3:18,6 --> 0:3:22,12
And so that was about as grass roots
as you can kind of get


60
0:3:22,12 --> 0:3:24,7
in terms of starting a non-profit.


61
0:3:24,7 --> 0:3:26,77
And I was 23, so I had no idea


62
0:3:26,77 --> 0:3:28,53
what starting a non-profit
would look like,


63
0:3:28,53 --> 0:3:30,89
which was really, really good.


64
0:3:30,89 --> 0:3:35,62
So, I began to work with girls and
young women who were being trafficked.


65
0:3:35,62 --> 0:3:39,73
And at that point though, we weren't using
that terminology "trafficking".


66
0:3:39,73 --> 0:3:43,16
And so "trafficking" kind of
came into or lexicon,


67
0:3:43,16 --> 0:3:47,18
really it began to come in in 2000, when
the Trafficking Victims Protection Act,


68
0:3:47,18 --> 0:3:49,15
federal legislation, was passed.


69
0:3:49,15 --> 0:3:51,28
And so, the handful of us
that were working


70
0:3:51,28 --> 0:3:54,41
with domestic trafficking victims
were really excited and thought:


71
0:3:54,41 --> 0:3:58,18
OK, this is the moment where our girls,
and young women, and adult women


72
0:3:58,18 --> 0:4:1,0
begin to be treated as victims,
not as criminals.


73
0:4:1,0 --> 0:4:5,27
And then we realized very quickly that
there was this kind of two-tiered system.


74
0:4:5,27 --> 0:4:8,57
And so, in terms of how
the funding was structured,


75
0:4:8,57 --> 0:4:12,29
in terms of how the training
for law enforcement and service providers,


76
0:4:12,29 --> 0:4:15,15
in terms of how kind of
the media and the public


77
0:4:15,15 --> 0:4:17,19
began to view this issue over the years,


78
0:4:17,19 --> 0:4:19,399
it was like: Well, there's
those real trafficking victims,


79
0:4:19,399 --> 0:4:23,17
there are those girls from Mexico,
or from Asia, or from the Ukraine,


80
0:4:23,17 --> 0:4:25,78
and you know there's
those teen prostitutes from America,


81
0:4:25,78 --> 0:4:28,43
who just kind of want to do this
and they like doing this.


82
0:4:28,43 --> 0:4:31,37
And so the battle over
the last really kind of decade,


83
0:4:31,37 --> 0:4:35,54
and change for us, has been about
really trying to educate people


84
0:4:35,54 --> 0:4:37,92
that the sexual exploitation
and trafficking


85
0:4:37,92 --> 0:4:39,95
of girls, and young women, and adult women


86
0:4:39,95 --> 0:4:44,81
in this country looks the same as it does
for girls and women globally,


87
0:4:44,81 --> 0:4:47,56
and that you don't have to be
from another country


88
0:4:47,56 --> 0:4:50,8
to feel like you don't have options
in this country, right?


89
0:4:50,8 --> 0:4:52,3
We're very good at doing the Horatio,


90
0:4:52,3 --> 0:4:55,14
how to pull yourself up
by your bootstraps, kind of myth,


91
0:4:55,14 --> 0:4:59,25
but if we're being honest, opportunities
aren't equal in this country,


92
0:4:59,25 --> 0:5:2,31
and there are entire segments
of our young people


93
0:5:2,31 --> 0:5:5,91
for whom opportunities
are frequently denied.


94
0:5:5,91 --> 0:5:8,14
And so, that's what
we've continuously found.


95
0:5:8,14 --> 0:5:10,23
And I will say that I think if this issue


96
0:5:10,23 --> 0:5:13,88
had affected the number
of low-income girls of color


97
0:5:13,88 --> 0:5:16,46
that we've seen
over the last 15 years,


98
0:5:16,46 --> 0:5:18,88
both in New York
and all over the country,


99
0:5:18,88 --> 0:5:22,28
if it had affected
white middle-class girls in that same way,


100
0:5:22,28 --> 0:5:27,8
we would've seen a very, very different
social and political response by now.


101
0:5:27,8 --> 0:5:29,88
We had to educate people to that.


102
0:5:29,88 --> 0:5:34,0
Just because you weren't undocumented
didn't mean you trusted law enforcement


103
0:5:34,0 --> 0:5:36,71
and went running to law enforcement
and said, "Hi, Mr Police Officer,


104
0:5:36,71 --> 0:5:39,4
please rescue me."
Right?


105
0:5:39,4 --> 0:5:42,98
We understand that for women and men
who are trafficked globally


106
0:5:42,98 --> 0:5:45,53
whether for sex or labor,


107
0:5:45,53 --> 0:5:48,66
their experiences with law enforcement
in their own countries


108
0:5:48,66 --> 0:5:51,46
haven't been particularly warm,


109
0:5:51,46 --> 0:5:54,64
and so they may not feel like
this is someone that they can go to.


110
0:5:54,64 --> 0:5:57,18
That's true for young people
in our country too,


111
0:5:57,18 --> 0:5:59,82
particularly, young people who've grown up
in communities of color,


112
0:5:59,82 --> 0:6:3,43
that historically don't have good reason
to trust law enforcement.


113
0:6:3,43 --> 0:6:4,85
And we also had to teach people


114
0:6:4,85 --> 0:6:7,14
that you don't have to be
chained physically


115
0:6:7,14 --> 0:6:10,51
to a bed or to a wall
in order to think that you can't leave.


116
0:6:10,51 --> 0:6:12,44
And with the domestic violence movement,


117
0:6:12,44 --> 0:6:15,24
we've begun to really work
over the last 30 years


118
0:6:15,24 --> 0:6:19,31
stopping folks from saying,
"Well, why doesn't she just leave?"


119
0:6:19,31 --> 0:6:22,96
And we began to recognize that it was
a lot more complex than that, right?


120
0:6:22,96 --> 0:6:27,45
And that here were many psychological
and sociological factors


121
0:6:27,45 --> 0:6:30,89
that would stop an adult woman
from leaving an abuser.


122
0:6:30,89 --> 0:6:33,9
And so when we're talking
about particularly children,


123
0:6:33,9 --> 0:6:36,55
when we're talking about girls
who are under the control of somebody


124
0:6:36,55 --> 0:6:40,53
whose entire job is to make them
loyal and compliant,


125
0:6:40,53 --> 0:6:44,42
we have to be able to apply
those same kind of ideas


126
0:6:44,42 --> 0:6:46,56
that we've come up with
with domestic violence


127
0:6:46,56 --> 0:6:50,31
and recognize that
the physical chains may not be there,


128
0:6:50,31 --> 0:6:53,22
but psychological chains
are much, much stronger.


129
0:6:53,22 --> 0:6:56,67
And when we think about someone like
Elizabeth Smart or Shawn Hornbeck,


130
0:6:56,67 --> 0:6:58,74
who is the little boy,
who was found in Missouri,


131
0:6:58,74 --> 0:7:0,72
several years after his kidnapping,


132
0:7:0,72 --> 0:7:6,11
or Jaycee Dugard, we generally don't ask:
Why didn't they just leave?


133
0:7:6,11 --> 0:7:8,47
We recognize Stockholm's syndrome
and trauma bonding.


134
0:7:8,47 --> 0:7:10,72
We recognize whatever was done
to those young people


135
0:7:10,72 --> 0:7:13,16
in the first few days, first few hours,


136
0:7:13,16 --> 0:7:17,31
was enough to keep them psychologically
trapped and bonded,


137
0:7:17,31 --> 0:7:19,54
and for them to believe
that they couldn't leave.


138
0:7:19,54 --> 0:7:22,48
So, that's kind of been the work
over the last 15 years,


139
0:7:22,48 --> 0:7:25,95
and slowly we're beginning
in the last maybe year, 18 months,


140
0:7:25,95 --> 0:7:30,7
we're beginning to see
kind of some level of change,


141
0:7:30,7 --> 0:7:34,51
and this slow shift in public perception,


142
0:7:34,51 --> 0:7:36,32
where we're beginning
to see more media stuff,


143
0:7:36,32 --> 0:7:40,63
and where we're beginning to see
kind of folks shifting their perception


144
0:7:40,63 --> 0:7:43,81
of who these girls are,
who these women are.


145
0:7:43,81 --> 0:7:46,56
And so, I mean, I think,
one of the most critical things


146
0:7:46,56 --> 0:7:48,89
that we've been able to do,
and that we did in New York,


147
0:7:48,89 --> 0:7:53,8
was be able to change,
not just kind of in concept,


148
0:7:53,8 --> 0:7:55,29
but actually in policy this idea


149
0:7:55,29 --> 0:7:58,24
that young people were victims,
not criminals.


150
0:7:58,24 --> 0:8:1,78
And so, for many years,
as I was working in juvenile detention,


151
0:8:1,78 --> 0:8:4,59
and like I said on the streets
and up on Rikers Island,


152
0:8:4,59 --> 0:8:8,54
I was seeing 12 and 13,
14, 15, 16-year-old girls


153
0:8:8,54 --> 0:8:11,83
who were being arrested and charged
with an act of prostitution,


154
0:8:11,83 --> 0:8:13,82
that under New York State law,


155
0:8:13,82 --> 0:8:16,93
they couldn't legally consent to,
because they couldn't legally


156
0:8:16,93 --> 0:8:19,3
consent to sex until they were 17.


157
0:8:19,3 --> 0:8:21,72
And so, in any other case,


158
0:8:21,72 --> 0:8:24,66
they would've been
a victim of statutory rape.


159
0:8:24,66 --> 0:8:27,23
And yet because money was exchanged,


160
0:8:27,23 --> 0:8:31,72
the 40-year-old, the 30-year-old,
the adult man who was buying them,


161
0:8:31,72 --> 0:8:35,72
was no longer seen as a statutory rapist,
he was seen just as a "John",


162
0:8:35,72 --> 0:8:39,299
and he was generally let go
with a little pat,


163
0:8:39,299 --> 0:8:42,25
same way we used to treat
domestic violence abusers


164
0:8:42,25 --> 0:8:44,36
for many, many years.


165
0:8:44,36 --> 0:8:47,15
And the girl, the child
who was being bought,


166
0:8:47,15 --> 0:8:50,73
the child who was being sold
by adult men to adult men,


167
0:8:50,73 --> 0:8:53,8
was the one who was arrested, incarcerated


168
0:8:53,8 --> 0:8:54,87
and generally sentenced to a year.


169
0:8:54,87 --> 0:8:59,53
We had one case, and this is the case
that kind of started the whole thing off,


170
0:8:59,53 --> 0:9:2,3
where we had a 12-year-old
who was arrested,


171
0:9:2,3 --> 0:9:6,18
she was sentenced upstate
to a juvenile detention center for a year,


172
0:9:6,18 --> 0:9:11,21
she had been in the foster care system,
she had been totally abandoned by family,


173
0:9:11,21 --> 0:9:13,76
she had a massive history
of trauma and abuse


174
0:9:13,76 --> 0:9:17,42
and had met an adult man who became
her "daddy", who became her pimp.


175
0:9:17,42 --> 0:9:22,16
And the judge said, "She needed to learn
proper moral principles."


176
0:9:22,16 --> 0:9:24,28
And so, that was the case that kind of...


177
0:9:24,28 --> 0:9:27,89
we said, "Hmm, something's wrong
with this legislation,


178
0:9:27,89 --> 0:9:33,67
something's wrong with a law
that doesn't protect victims


179
0:9:33,67 --> 0:9:35,9
but sees them, children, as criminals,


180
0:9:35,9 --> 0:9:38,77
and isn't addressing this
as a human rights issue."


181
0:9:38,77 --> 0:9:40,85
And yet we've got federal law


182
0:9:40,85 --> 0:9:44,94
that recognizes children
from other countries as victims,


183
0:9:44,94 --> 0:9:48,51
and technically does recognize children
from our country as victims,


184
0:9:48,51 --> 0:9:50,39
but it's not happening at a state level.


185
0:9:50,39 --> 0:9:53,37
And so for about 4.5 years,
the young women at GEMS and I


186
0:9:53,37 --> 0:9:55,15
trekked up to Albany,
we worked very closely


187
0:9:55,15 --> 0:9:57,21
with the legal aid Juvenile
Rights Division,


188
0:9:57,21 --> 0:10:0,76
and in the beginning we would go
in a room, and it would be 4 legislators,


189
0:10:0,76 --> 0:10:2,99
and they were totally bored and apathetic.


190
0:10:2,99 --> 0:10:5,3
And we would go back and
we would go back again,


191
0:10:5,3 --> 0:10:8,25
and the girls would say,
"It's all white men in suits."


192
0:10:8,25 --> 0:10:10,6
And say, "Yes, let's have a conversation


193
0:10:10,6 --> 0:10:12,16
about power and privileged
and what that looks like".


194
0:10:12,16 --> 0:10:16,4
And so it became kind of
a civic participation lesson in action


195
0:10:16,4 --> 0:10:18,45
over the course of about 4.5, 5 years.


196
0:10:18,45 --> 0:10:21,44
And eventually we were able
to make New York State


197
0:10:21,44 --> 0:10:25,72
the first state in the country to protect,
not prosecute, children


198
0:10:25,72 --> 0:10:28,3
who have been sexually exploited
and trafficked.


199
0:10:28,3 --> 0:10:30,16
That happened in 2008.


200
0:10:30,16 --> 0:10:35,63
We were very conscious of kind of what
could happen nationally with that law,


201
0:10:35,63 --> 0:10:37,66
And since then 9 of the states


202
0:10:37,66 --> 0:10:41,24
have passed similar, what they're calling
"safe harbor", legislation.


203
0:10:41,24 --> 0:10:44,71
So we are now 10 states down,
40 to go.


204
0:10:44,71 --> 0:10:47,37
I would like to believe in 5 years
we will look back,


205
0:10:47,37 --> 0:10:50,6
like we look back on many other issues,
and think,


206
0:10:50,6 --> 0:10:53,53
"Did we really send
12-year-olds to jail!?


207
0:10:53,53 --> 0:10:57,4
Did we really let the adult men
who were doing the buying and selling go?


208
0:10:57,4 --> 0:11:1,1
That seems ludicrous.
We don't live in that kind of country."


209
0:11:1,1 --> 0:11:3,75
So, I believe that we have
the ability to get there,


210
0:11:3,75 --> 0:11:6,39
but I think what's critical
and what we need to kind of...


211
0:11:6,39 --> 0:11:10,63
the next layer of where we're going
in the anti-trafficking movement,


212
0:11:10,63 --> 0:11:13,91
ending commercial
sexual exploitation movement,


213
0:11:13,91 --> 0:11:18,19
is really about kind of making sure
that we're tying these issues,


214
0:11:18,19 --> 0:11:23,17
the issue of sexual exploitation
into like these larger systemic issues,


215
0:11:23,17 --> 0:11:27,26
because oftentimes what we're finding now
with the media focus on this issue,


216
0:11:27,26 --> 0:11:33,46
for anybody who's seeing MSNBC special
or something in the newspaper,


217
0:11:33,46 --> 0:11:36,26
it tends to be very sensationalized
and very kind of,


218
0:11:36,26 --> 0:11:39,54
"Rescue little girls, bad men
-- arrest them!"


219
0:11:39,54 --> 0:11:42,21
It tends to be that kind of paradigm,


220
0:11:42,21 --> 0:11:45,26
and yet we're not addressing
the social factors


221
0:11:45,26 --> 0:11:49,46
that make young people so
incredibly vulnerable in the first place.


222
0:11:49,46 --> 0:11:52,9
Like I said, predominantly,
what we are seeing


223
0:11:52,9 --> 0:11:55,0
are low-income girls, girls of color,


224
0:11:55,0 --> 0:11:57,42
girls who've been
in the child welfare system,


225
0:11:57,42 --> 0:11:59,54
over 70% of the girls that GEMS serves


226
0:11:59,54 --> 0:12:1,71
have been in the child welfare system
at some point,


227
0:12:1,71 --> 0:12:5,71
girls who have been victims
of childhood sexual abuse and trauma.


228
0:12:5,71 --> 0:12:11,9
We know that anywhere from 70% to 90%
of both children and adult women


229
0:12:11,9 --> 0:12:13,55
who end up in the sex industry,


230
0:12:13,55 --> 0:12:16,97
were victims of child sexual abuse
prior to recruitment.


231
0:12:16,97 --> 0:12:21,41
There is no other industry in the world
that targets folks


232
0:12:21,41 --> 0:12:24,21
who have been victims
of childhood sexual abuse,


233
0:12:24,21 --> 0:12:28,53
one of the most traumatic things that
you can experience, in such a way, right?


234
0:12:28,53 --> 0:12:32,54
That preys upon the most vulnerable people
in our society,


235
0:12:32,54 --> 0:12:36,1
some of the most marginalized folks
in our entire community.


236
0:12:36,1 --> 0:12:38,82
And so we have to be able to
address some of these root causes,


237
0:12:38,82 --> 0:12:43,48
we have to be able to address
opportunities for all of our young people,


238
0:12:43,48 --> 0:12:46,25
and make sure that we are not predicating


239
0:12:46,25 --> 0:12:48,83
what your future looks like
as a young person,


240
0:12:48,83 --> 0:12:51,62
based on the ZIP code
that you are born into.


241
0:12:51,62 --> 0:12:55,7
We need to make sure
that we are addressing


242
0:12:55,7 --> 0:12:57,78
kind of some of
these larger systemic issues,


243
0:12:57,78 --> 0:12:59,85
particularly, gender-based violence.


244
0:12:59,85 --> 0:13:1,69
And I will say that, you know,


245
0:13:1,69 --> 0:13:4,17
for the last couple of years,
there was a point


246
0:13:4,17 --> 0:13:7,42
where you couldn't get like
3 people in a room to talk about this.


247
0:13:7,42 --> 0:13:10,75
And then there was a point when
you began to get folks showing up


248
0:13:10,75 --> 0:13:13,48
but now, right, you do
an anti-trafficking workshop


249
0:13:13,48 --> 0:13:15,5
and there's a ton of people showing up.


250
0:13:15,5 --> 0:13:20,84
And yet we can't get folks now to come
to a domestic violence presentation,


251
0:13:20,84 --> 0:13:24,85
because we think we've solved it,
we think we've addressed that,


252
0:13:24,85 --> 0:13:28,96
we think it's one of those things we don't
really need to focus on right now,


253
0:13:28,96 --> 0:13:33,21
and yet, we know that domestic violence
is happening... now.


254
0:13:33,21 --> 0:13:38,52
And if I waited another few seconds...
again, and again, in our country.


255
0:13:38,52 --> 0:13:42,93
And so, we have to be able to address kind
of the continuum of gender-based violence,


256
0:13:42,93 --> 0:13:48,2
of which commercial sexual exploitation
and trafficking is just one component.


257
0:13:48,2 --> 0:13:51,97
We have to be able to address race


258
0:13:51,97 --> 0:13:55,91
and the impact of racism
on young people in this country,


259
0:13:55,91 --> 0:14:0,5
and particularly how that plays out
in the commercial sex industry.


260
0:14:0,5 --> 0:14:2,7
I will tell you that, and this isn't
a talk about pornography,


261
0:14:2,7 --> 0:14:8,46
but I will tell you that pornography is
one of the few industries anywhere


262
0:14:8,46 --> 0:14:12,36
that you can still be blatantly racist.


263
0:14:12,36 --> 0:14:18,3
And I encourage you to look at some
of the links between race and pornography,


264
0:14:18,3 --> 0:14:20,93
and how that plays out in our culture,


265
0:14:20,93 --> 0:14:25,5
and how we're still
really comfortable in that world,


266
0:14:25,5 --> 0:14:28,19
in terms of addressing people through race


267
0:14:28,19 --> 0:14:31,41
and very racialized,
sexualized stereotypes.


268
0:14:31,41 --> 0:14:33,98
We have to be able to think,


269
0:14:33,98 --> 0:14:38,51
where do we want to be
in 5 to 10 years on this issue,


270
0:14:38,51 --> 0:14:40,34
because sometimes we can go,


271
0:14:40,34 --> 0:14:43,22
and I think this is true
of all social justice movements,


272
0:14:43,22 --> 0:14:48,4
we can address kind of
the very exciting sexy topics,


273
0:14:48,4 --> 0:14:50,94
and not really dig deeper,


274
0:14:50,94 --> 0:14:54,7
and go long term
for the long-term gains.


275
0:14:54,7 --> 0:14:57,86
And so, every issue
has its moment in the sun,


276
0:14:57,86 --> 0:15:0,69
and right now trafficking
is having its moment.


277
0:15:0,69 --> 0:15:2,98
The domestic violence movement
had its moment.


278
0:15:2,98 --> 0:15:5,31
The environment kind of had its moment.


279
0:15:5,31 --> 0:15:7,14
HIV/AIDS had its moment.


280
0:15:7,14 --> 0:15:9,93
And that's not to say that work
isn't still being done,


281
0:15:9,93 --> 0:15:12,26
but there is
a very particular point in time,


282
0:15:12,26 --> 0:15:15,74
for every social justice issue
where the focus is on it,


283
0:15:15,74 --> 0:15:18,53
and there's a lot of momentum,
and a lot of excitement,


284
0:15:18,53 --> 0:15:20,71
and the media is all over it.


285
0:15:20,71 --> 0:15:23,23
And we're kind of hitting that point
and we're very close


286
0:15:23,23 --> 0:15:26,22
to hitting that point in
the trafficking movement right now,


287
0:15:26,22 --> 0:15:28,81
but we have to think about:
What do we want to see


288
0:15:28,81 --> 0:15:32,22
kind of 5, 10, 15, 20 years out?


289
0:15:32,22 --> 0:15:35,42
And so some of those things
might not be


290
0:15:35,42 --> 0:15:38,49
the most sexiest things
that we can address.


291
0:15:38,49 --> 0:15:43,96
Arresting men and saving girls
sounds like a good concept,


292
0:15:43,96 --> 0:15:47,11
but rescue isn't
a long-term sustainable method


293
0:15:47,11 --> 0:15:49,6
of addressing folks' needs.


294
0:15:49,6 --> 0:15:51,78
We have to be looking
from an empowerment perspective.


295
0:15:51,78 --> 0:15:59,88
I will say that just looking
at the "Kony 2012" video,


296
0:15:59,88 --> 0:16:2,89
if you didn't see it,
you were living under a rock,


297
0:16:2,89 --> 0:16:6,64
it just picked up
this massive level of momentum.


298
0:16:6,64 --> 0:16:9,19
But I'll say there are some things
that the anti-trafficking movement


299
0:16:9,19 --> 0:16:11,24
could kind of learn from that.


300
0:16:11,24 --> 0:16:16,61
It's critical that we are highlighting
voices that are on the ground,


301
0:16:16,61 --> 0:16:18,92
and we are highlighting
the voices of survivors,


302
0:16:18,92 --> 0:16:21,87
and not in
a get-up-and-tell-your-story way.


303
0:16:21,87 --> 0:16:27,15
As a survivor and somebody who's been
in a leadership role for many years,


304
0:16:27,15 --> 0:16:30,67
I'm still in positions where,
you know, the focus becomes


305
0:16:30,67 --> 0:16:33,92
kind of "The sensational aspects
of my story,"


306
0:16:33,92 --> 0:16:36,27
and "What did you go through?"
and "What did you experience?"


307
0:16:36,27 --> 0:16:40,1
As opposed to the fact, [that] as
an executive director for last 14 years,


308
0:16:40,1 --> 0:16:45,9
I actually have some ideas, about policy,
and programming, and development,


309
0:16:45,9 --> 0:16:47,86
and there is some of that stuff
that I bring to the table.


310
0:16:47,86 --> 0:16:53,18
And while my story is critical
in terms of informing the work that I do,


311
0:16:53,18 --> 0:16:54,99
it's one part of me.


312
0:16:54,99 --> 0:16:58,63
And if we're really serious
about addressing victims


313
0:16:58,63 --> 0:17:1,28
and supporting victims
into becoming survivors,


314
0:17:1,28 --> 0:17:3,9
and then ultimately leaders,


315
0:17:3,9 --> 0:17:6,19
we have to think about: How do we move


316
0:17:6,19 --> 0:17:9,23
from that very kind of,
on some levels, voyeuristic,


317
0:17:9,23 --> 0:17:12,51
kind of: "I want to know all
the ins and outs of all the violence,


318
0:17:12,51 --> 0:17:14,95
and trauma and all the bad stuff
that happened to you"?


319
0:17:14,95 --> 0:17:18,569
And I could've gotten up here today
and done that piece,


320
0:17:18,569 --> 0:17:20,93
But [it would have been] less helpful


321
0:17:20,93 --> 0:17:26,68
in terms of how we're thinking about
this issue as a community, as a movement.


322
0:17:26,68 --> 0:17:28,66
We can learn from "Kony"


323
0:17:28,66 --> 0:17:31,81
the things that are sensational
may get the attention,


324
0:17:31,81 --> 0:17:35,14
but they don't necessarily provide
the most nuanced view


325
0:17:35,14 --> 0:17:37,6
of what's happening on the ground,


326
0:17:37,6 --> 0:17:41,64
and that the things that may seem
to make the most sense initially


327
0:17:41,64 --> 0:17:44,67
and appeal to our good, evil...


328
0:17:44,67 --> 0:17:48,3
This is an incredibly complex issue.


329
0:17:48,3 --> 0:17:51,62
And we have to be able
to address economic empowerment,


330
0:17:51,62 --> 0:17:56,4
we have to be able to address education
and employment for girls and women,


331
0:17:56,4 --> 0:17:58,48
globally, and in this country too.


332
0:17:58,48 --> 0:18:3,39
We've gotten much better
about talking about the need


333
0:18:3,39 --> 0:18:6,19
for economic empowerment
for girls globally.


334
0:18:6,19 --> 0:18:9,38
But we're doing a pretty crappy job
about recognizing


335
0:18:9,38 --> 0:18:13,16
that some of those same issues
exist right here,


336
0:18:13,16 --> 0:18:16,85
right down the block from us,
right in our own backyards.


337
0:18:16,85 --> 0:18:21,11
And so, that desire
to address "the other"


338
0:18:21,11 --> 0:18:25,76
when it comes to particularly any issue,
but particularly sex trafficking,


339
0:18:25,76 --> 0:18:29,0
and having empathy for brown
and black children in other countries,


340
0:18:29,0 --> 0:18:31,0
but not so much in our country,


341
0:18:31,0 --> 0:18:34,91
being able to address services
and support in other countries,


342
0:18:34,91 --> 0:18:36,72
but again not in our own country,


343
0:18:36,72 --> 0:18:38,95
is somewhere that we have to
move away from.


344
0:18:38,95 --> 0:18:41,25
And so I encourage you


345
0:18:41,25 --> 0:18:44,49
to really just think about...
in the next...


346
0:18:44,49 --> 0:18:47,4
you've got a lot to think about, right?


347
0:18:47,4 --> 0:18:49,35
You've heard a lot
of different talks today,


348
0:18:49,35 --> 0:18:52,17
but I encourage you on this issue
to really think about


349
0:18:52,17 --> 0:18:57,38
how can you tie this issue in
with the work that you're doing.


350
0:18:57,38 --> 0:19:1,2
The next speaker's going to
talk about economics, right?


351
0:19:1,2 --> 0:19:4,4
Sex trafficking and exploitation
is totally connected to that.


352
0:19:4,4 --> 0:19:9,15
The amazing presentation today on PTSD
and memory, that's connected.


353
0:19:9,15 --> 0:19:12,66
All of these issues are connected,
and when we silo stuff off,


354
0:19:12,66 --> 0:19:15,45
and make it kind of its own little issue,


355
0:19:15,45 --> 0:19:17,43
we do ourselves a disservice.


356
0:19:17,43 --> 0:19:19,63
So, I'm going wrap here,
but thank you very much.


357
0:19:19,63 --> 0:21:19,63
(Applause)
