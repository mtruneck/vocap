0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:6,253



2
0:0:6,253 --> 0:0:8,7
MILENE LARSSON: When we covered
the Beijing punk


3
0:0:8,7 --> 0:0:10,76
scene, we were surprised by how
apolitical most of these


4
0:0:10,76 --> 0:0:11,78
bands were.


5
0:0:11,78 --> 0:0:14,48
So we decided to meet up with
Cui Jian, the grandfather of


6
0:0:14,48 --> 0:0:15,93
Chinese rock.


7
0:0:15,93 --> 0:0:18,15
Cui Jian is the biggest rock
star in China, and he's


8
0:0:18,15 --> 0:0:21,13
probably more punk than all the
new bands put together.


9
0:0:21,13 --> 0:0:23,32
He wrote the song, "Nothing to
My Name," that became the


10
0:0:23,32 --> 0:0:25,83
anthem of the student
revolution of '89.


11
0:0:25,83 --> 0:0:28,3
And the album it was featured on
was the best-selling record


12
0:0:28,3 --> 0:0:29,38
in China's history.


13
0:0:29,38 --> 0:0:32,47
Since Cui Jian has witnessed
China's massive change, we


14
0:0:32,47 --> 0:0:34,6
thought that he might have
some answers to why the


15
0:0:34,6 --> 0:0:36,44
country that invented stuff
like paper and the compass


16
0:0:36,44 --> 0:0:40,71
hasn't really come up with
anything new lately.


17
0:0:40,71 --> 0:0:45,1
We've been here in Beijing for a
week and a half already, and


18
0:0:45,1 --> 0:0:47,7
we've been meeting a
lot of young bands.


19
0:0:47,7 --> 0:0:49,87
It's basically all
rock and roll.


20
0:0:49,87 --> 0:0:53,39
Has China kind of run
out of new ideas?


21
0:0:53,39 --> 0:0:55,77
Or why all these Western
influences?


22
0:0:55,77 --> 0:1:0,54
CUI JIAN: You know, we start
from Western classical music.


23
0:1:0,54 --> 0:1:4,25
When I was 14 years old,
I started the trumpet.


24
0:1:4,25 --> 0:1:7,4
Someone doesn't really think,
this is Western, as they would


25
0:1:7,4 --> 0:1:9,95
say, this is the fashion,
this is international.


26
0:1:9,95 --> 0:1:12,42
Don't believe someone
said Chinese rock


27
0:1:12,42 --> 0:1:14,38
and roll is so active.


28
0:1:14,38 --> 0:1:19,21
Only in Beijing, few clubs in
the weekend, the huge country.


29
0:1:19,21 --> 0:1:20,57
No, it's joke.


30
0:1:20,57 --> 0:1:21,93
It's a joke.


31
0:1:21,93 --> 0:1:23,96
It's not culture yet.


32
0:1:23,96 --> 0:1:25,57
Everybody copying.


33
0:1:25,57 --> 0:1:32,84
Something wrong, because they
lose their own creativity.


34
0:1:32,84 --> 0:1:34,63
They listen to Western music.


35
0:1:34,63 --> 0:1:38,29
They have a much better system,
but they don't create.


36
0:1:38,29 --> 0:1:41,9
So the real situation in China,
what the young people


37
0:1:41,9 --> 0:1:45,99
really thinking about
in China.


38
0:1:45,99 --> 0:1:52,45
But I don't think you can get
this from a CCTV, or we can


39
0:1:52,45 --> 0:1:54,97
get some more on [INAUDIBLE].


40
0:1:54,97 --> 0:1:57,51
I don't think you can
get something who


41
0:1:57,51 --> 0:1:59,25
tell you the truth.


42
0:1:59,25 --> 0:2:1,88
People telling the truth is a
good image for the country,


43
0:2:1,88 --> 0:2:2,7
for the government.


44
0:2:2,7 --> 0:2:5,69
The young people say something
bad about this country, it


45
0:2:5,69 --> 0:2:8,729
doesn't mean they don't
like this country.


46
0:2:8,729 --> 0:2:12,66
Maybe it's just because they
love this country, and they


47
0:2:12,66 --> 0:2:15,55
don't feel satisfied and they
say something because they


48
0:2:15,55 --> 0:2:16,61
want changes.


49
0:2:16,61 --> 0:2:19,35
MILENE LARSSON: Shouldn't
China still be creating


50
0:2:19,35 --> 0:2:23,84
something new, since you're
such a big nation?


51
0:2:23,84 --> 0:2:25,55
CUI JIAN: I want to say I
appreciate you asking me these


52
0:2:25,55 --> 0:2:32,54
questions, why China has such
huge history and culture, and


53
0:2:32,54 --> 0:2:35,23
then they just want to leave
them alone and listen to the


54
0:2:35,23 --> 0:2:41,64
Western music or culture.


55
0:2:41,64 --> 0:2:42,81
So it's a good question.


56
0:2:42,81 --> 0:2:45,27
And a lot of people will
keep thinking about it.


57
0:2:45,27 --> 0:2:49,65
I don't think my answer is
right, even from now.


58
0:2:49,65 --> 0:2:52,18
In a lot of things, I have
to keep thinking.


59
0:2:52,18 --> 0:2:57,94
But it's very, very important,
because I don't think it's a


60
0:2:57,94 --> 0:2:59,96
matter of Chinese
young people.


61
0:2:59,96 --> 0:3:3,62
I think this is a big matter
of the whole world, because


62
0:3:3,62 --> 0:3:8,7
China's big, and China has
really beautiful culture.


63
0:3:8,7 --> 0:3:12,17
Confucius has totally destroyed


64
0:3:12,17 --> 0:3:14,82
the culture of China.


65
0:3:14,82 --> 0:3:17,51
It's the worst part of China.


66
0:3:17,51 --> 0:3:20,86
Confucius teach people how to
be nice to people, but not


67
0:3:20,86 --> 0:3:25,24
nice to themselves,
how to be polite.


68
0:3:25,24 --> 0:3:28,27
My parents, I have to
be nice to them.


69
0:3:28,27 --> 0:3:33,7
But we have totally lost the
direction about searching


70
0:3:33,7 --> 0:3:34,95
themselves.


71
0:3:34,95 --> 0:3:37,195
This is the bad part
of the culture.


72
0:3:37,195 --> 0:3:40,8
Don't listen to him.


73
0:3:40,8 --> 0:3:44,77
He's old guy, born
2,000 years ago.


74
0:3:44,77 --> 0:3:46,84
And he said something.


75
0:3:46,84 --> 0:3:50,36
For that moment, it's
OK, but not for now.


76
0:3:50,36 --> 0:3:50,99
We [INAUDIBLE]


77
0:3:50,99 --> 0:3:51,61
young people.


78
0:3:51,61 --> 0:3:53,19
We have Chinese young people.


79
0:3:53,19 --> 0:3:55,61
Don't believe that.


80
0:3:55,61 --> 0:3:57,42
MILENE LARSSON: The fact that
Cui Jian is so popular and


81
0:3:57,42 --> 0:4:0,11
outspoken has put him in
difficulties with the Chinese


82
0:4:0,11 --> 0:4:0,99
government.


83
0:4:0,99 --> 0:4:3,23
People can buy his records,
since he's managed to get


84
0:4:3,23 --> 0:4:4,51
around the censorship
boundaries


85
0:4:4,51 --> 0:4:5,715
through allegoric lyrics.


86
0:4:5,715 --> 0:4:8,54
But to see China's biggest rock
star perform live is a


87
0:4:8,54 --> 0:4:9,73
whole different deal.


88
0:4:9,73 --> 0:4:12,78
He hasn't been able to play
any major venues in China


89
0:4:12,78 --> 0:4:15,385
since his inappropriate stage
behavior on the fundraising


90
0:4:15,385 --> 0:4:17,86
tour for the 1990 Asian games.


91
0:4:17,86 --> 0:4:20,354
And according to Western media,
he's been banned from


92
0:4:20,354 --> 0:4:22,2
playing live.


93
0:4:22,2 --> 0:5:0,5



94
0:5:0,5 --> 0:5:2,46
MILENE LARSSON: How do
you make sense of it?


95
0:5:2,46 --> 0:5:14,15



96
0:5:14,15 --> 0:5:16,75
MILENE LARSSON: Still, you
managed to kind of


97
0:5:16,75 --> 0:5:18,5
not play the game.


98
0:5:18,5 --> 0:5:19,3
You did your own--


99
0:5:19,3 --> 0:5:36,71



100
0:5:36,71 --> 0:5:38,96
MILENE LARSSON: You've been
playing a lot of shows abroad.


101
0:5:38,96 --> 0:5:40,66
You told me you were
in the US.


102
0:5:40,66 --> 0:5:46,25
What do you feel is the Western
world's perception and


103
0:5:46,25 --> 0:5:48,46
opinions about China?


104
0:5:48,46 --> 0:6:27,46



105
0:6:27,46 --> 0:6:28,71
MILENE LARSSON: Yeah.


106
0:6:28,71 --> 0:6:45,98



107
0:6:45,98 --> 0:6:48,56
MILENE LARSSON: When you're in
the US or in Denmark, or


108
0:6:48,56 --> 0:6:54,237
wherever you are, how do Western
people react to China?


109
0:6:54,237 --> 0:7:51,204



110
0:7:51,204 --> 0:8:13,57
[MUSIC PLAYING]


111
0:8:13,57 --> 0:8:15,33
MILENE LARSSON: We started to
understand why Cui Jian is


112
0:8:15,33 --> 0:8:17,89
such an icon, as our chat with
him turned into one of the


113
0:8:17,89 --> 0:8:20,2
most keen and precise
explanations of the Chinese


114
0:8:20,2 --> 0:8:21,475
psyche that we've ever heard.


115
0:8:21,475 --> 0:8:24,5



116
0:8:24,5 --> 0:8:26,45
Even though over a fifth of the
world's population lives


117
0:8:26,45 --> 0:8:29,32
in China, it's rare to find
Chinese music that actually


118
0:8:29,32 --> 0:8:30,35
has something to say.


119
0:8:30,35 --> 0:8:37,15
[MUSIC PLAYING]


120
0:8:37,15 --> 0:8:39,76
MILENE LARSSON: Almost everybody
that we meet knows


121
0:8:39,76 --> 0:8:42,606
your songs and say that you
mean a lot to them.


122
0:8:42,606 --> 0:8:46,23



123
0:8:46,23 --> 0:8:48,73
MILENE LARSSON: I kind of get
the impression that you're


124
0:8:48,73 --> 0:8:49,84
important to them.


125
0:8:49,84 --> 0:8:53,5
And it makes me wonder,
makes us wonder, what


126
0:8:53,5 --> 0:8:54,3
are your songs about?


127
0:8:54,3 --> 0:10:49,583



128
0:10:49,583 --> 0:10:53,56
MILENE LARSSON: I read an
interview where you said


129
0:10:53,56 --> 0:10:59,66
something about, people used to
be heroes and now they care


130
0:10:59,66 --> 0:11:2,22
more about having
a nice salary.


131
0:11:2,22 --> 0:11:6,89
Do you think why this generation
have a lot of money


132
0:11:6,89 --> 0:11:11,3
concerns is because they are
the generation under the


133
0:11:11,3 --> 0:11:12,28
capitalism?


134
0:11:12,28 --> 0:11:58,29



135
0:11:58,29 --> 0:11:59,82
MILENE LARSSON: What do you
listen to right now?


136
0:11:59,82 --> 0:12:17,844



137
0:12:17,844 --> 0:12:19,94
MILENE LARSSON: Missy Elliott?


138
0:12:19,94 --> 0:14:19,94
