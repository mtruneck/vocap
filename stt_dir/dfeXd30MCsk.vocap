###2 GOOD MORNING. AT THE END OF TODAY'S LECTURE I
###4 WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MIDTERM AND IF YOU
###7 HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I WANT TO REMIND YOU AGAIN THE
###10 REVIEW SESSION IS GOING TO BE ON TUESDAY NIGHT AT 6:00
###13 O'CLOCK IN 145 DWINELLE. AND, IT WILL NOT BE WEBCAST.
###18 SO, THAT IF YOU WISH TO COME YOU WILL HAVE TO COME
###22 BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PICK IT UP ON THE
###23 WEBCAST. THE OTHER THING IS, THAT IT IS A WORKING
###26 SESSION. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING PREPARED AND I WILL
###29 TAKE WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU ASK AND WE WILL TRY TO
###31 ANSWER THEM. SO, MAKE GOOD USE OF THE TIME. AT THE
###36 END OF THE LECTURE TODAY AS I MENTIONED I WILL TALK
###38 A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE MIDTERM AND I WILL HAVE
###41 OFFICE HOURS NEXT WEEK ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS
###44 USUAL. AND I WILL BE GLAD TO MEET WITH YOU.
###50 LAST TIME I INTRODUCED YOU TO SOME OF THE
###52 CONCEPTS THAT WERE, THAT WATER MOVEMENT AND WATER
###56 RELATIONS REVOLVE AROUND. AND WE SAID THAT THE
###60 
###63 SYSTEMS, IS DETERMINED BY THE WATER POTENTIAL. AND,
###70 WE SAID THAT THE WATER POTENTIAL WAS A ABBREVIATED BY
###72 THE GREEK LETTER PSI. AND THAT THE WATER POTENTIAL
###76 FOR OUR PURPOSES OF PURE WATER, WE SAID WAS EQUAL TO
###81 ZERO. PSI EQUALS ZERO FOR PURE WATER. WE ALSO SAID
###86 THAT WATER POTENTIAL HAS SEVERAL COMPONENTS WHICH MAKE
###90 IT UP. SO THEN WE SAID THAT PSI EQUALS PSI'S OF PI
###94 PLUS PSI'S OF P. THESE TWO COMPONENTS WHICH MAKE UP
###97 THE WATER POTENTIAL WHICH DETERMINE WHICH WAY THE
###100 WATER MOVES. LAST TIME WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS WE
###105 ALSO MENTIONED TO YOU THAT THE DRIVING FORCE FOR WATER
###114 MOVEMENT AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT
###121 FROM LAST LECTURE, IN PLANTS IS THE EVAPORATION OF
###129 WATER, WHICH WE SAID WAS EQUAL TO TRANSPIRATION.
###143 ESSENTIALLY IF YOU REMEMBER OF COLUMN OF WATER THAT I
###145 ILLUSTRATED TO YOU LAST TIME WITH THE RUBBER BAND
###149 BEING THE HYDROGEN BONDS AND THE YELLOW BEING THE
###151 
###154 STRETCHED DUE TO TRANSPIRATION AND WATER IS LITERALLY
###159 PULLED UP THE TREE, PULLED UP THE TREE DUE TO THIS
###163 STRETCHING. AND THIS IS THE MECHANISM BY WHICH WATER
###167 IS MOVED UP THE TREE. THIS PULL, WHICH ORIGINATES AS
###170 A RESULT OF A EVAPORATION AND IS PASSED DOWN THROUGH
###174 THE HYDROGEN BONDS FROM ONE WATER MOLECULE TO ANOTHER.
###178 AND WE WILL RETURN TO THIS IDEA IN A MOMENT. FINALLY,
###182 LAST TIME I ENDED BY TALKING TO YOU ABOUT A CELL IN
###187 WHICH THE MEMBRANE HAD BEEN PULLED AWAY FROM THE CELL
###192 DURING WILTING.
###196 AND WE SAID THAT THE MEMBRANE, WHICH IS
###198 INDICATED BY THIS LINE HERE, WAS PULLED AWAY FROM THE
###203 CELL WHEN WATER IS LOST FROM THE CELL. AT THIS POINT
###214 WHERE THE MEMBRANE JUST PULLS AWAY
###226 WE SAID THAT PSI'S
###227 OF P EQUALS ZERO.
###230 AND WE GIVE A SPECIAL NAME TO THIS POINT WHERE
###233 PSI'S OF P JUST EQUALS ZERO. WE CALL THIS INCIPIENT
###237 
###246 THERE IS A YOUTUBE URL WHICH IS POSTED ON YOUR WEB
###250 PAGE WHICH WILL TAKE YOU TO SOME EXAMPLES OF INCIPIENT
###253 PLASMOLYSIS OR PLASMOLYSIS IN GENERAL. AND YOU ARE
###256 ALSO GOING TO BE DOING THIS IN THE LAB THE WEEK AFTER
###259 NEXT. YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO DO IT YOURSELF. NOW,
###263 WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY IS TO GIVE YOU SOME PRACTICE
###267 WITH THE WATER RELATIONS EQUATION THAT WILL HELP YOU
###269 WITH YOUR EXAMPLES THAT ARE GOING TO BE ON YOUR
###272 PROBLEM SET. AND I WANT TO BEGIN WITH THE AN EXAMPLE
###277 THAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME. WHICH WAS THE
###280 STOMATA. WANT TO TALK ABOUT THESE. WE SAID THE
###283 STOMATA WERE THE PORES AND THE GUARD CELLS THROUGH
###287 WHICH WATER VAPOR ESCAPED AND THROUGH WHICH CO2 ENTERS
###290 INTO THE PLANT. AND I SAID LAST TIME AND YOU READ
###293 ABOUT IT IN YOUR BOOK, THAT THE SIZE OF THE PORE IS
###296 DETERMINED BY HOW MUCH PRESSURE IS INSIDE OF GUARD
###300 CELLS. THIS SHOULD JUST BE REVIEW FROM LAST TIME.
###302 
###305 DOES THIS PRESSURE ARISE IN THE GUARD CELL? WE SAID
###308 THAT THAT PRESSURE WAS CALLED TURGOR PRESSURE. WE
###311 WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT ARISES AND HOW IT IS RELATED
###314 TO WATER. SO, LET'S DRAW A GUARD CELL FOR US. HERE
###319 IS THE PORE. AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE PORE ARE THE
###324 TWO GUARD CELLS. TWO GUARD CELLS. AND THEY'RE, OF
###332 COURSE, ARE PART OF THE EPIDERMIS ON THE LEAF SO THEY
###335 ARE SURROUNDED BY OTHER EPIDERMAL CELLS. AND THE ONE
###344 OTHER THING THAT WE HAVE TO ADD TO THIS, WHICH IS
###346 IMPLIED, IS THAT EACH OF THE CELLS BECAUSE THEY ARE
###350 ALIVE, HAVE A MEMBRANE. HAVE A MEMBRANE. LET'S BEGIN
###365 NOW WITH A SERIES OF STEPS THAT WE WOULD FOLLOW IN THE
###369 OPENING OF THE PORE. SO, WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
###372 OPENING OF THE PORE. THE FIRST STEP WHICH IS GOING TO
###379 HAVE TO HAPPEN IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO START
###383 THINKING OF SOME WAY OF BUILDING UP THE PRESSURE
###387 INSIDE OF THE GUARD CELLS TO CAUSE THEM TO OPEN UP, TO
###391 
###394 THAT SOLUTES AND THE PARTICULAR SOLUTE THAT WE WANT TO
###400 TALK ABOUT IS POTASSIUM, IS MOVED ACTIVELY FROM THE
###409 EPIDERMAL CELL
###416 INTO THE GUARD CELL. AND I WILL JUST
###419 ABBREVIATE GUARD CELL AS GC. THIS RESULTS IN A MORE
###429 NEGATIVE PSI'S OF PI IN THE GUARD CELL. MORE NEGATIVE
###436 PSI'S OF PI IN THE GUARD CELL, WHICH RESULTS IN
###440 A CHANGE IN THE PSI OF THE GUARD CELL. BECOMES MORE
###449 NEGATIVE.
###456 AND AT THIS POINT THEN, WATER ENTERS THE
###465 GUARD CELL INCREASING TURGOR PRESSURE AND THE GUARD
###474 CELL OPENS. THE PORE OPENS.
###483 NOW, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO PUT SOME
###486 NUMBERS TO MAKE A TABLE, TO GIVE YOU SOME REAL NUMBERS
###490 WITH REGARD TO THE WATER POTENTIAL EQUATION OF WHAT IS
###494 HAPPENING AS THE POTASSIUM IS MOVING INTO THE GUARD
###497 CELL. AND, FOR THIS PURPOSE WE ARE GOING TO MAKE
###500 A TABLE AND THIS TABLE WILL HAVE THREE VALUES. IT
###511 WILL HAVE PSI, PSI'S OF PI, AND PSI'S OF P. AND, WE
###518 
###522 PSI'S OF P CHANGE IN THE GUARD CELL WHEN IT IS EITHER
###526 OPEN OR CLOSED. SO, IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE WILL
###530 SAY, THIS IS WHEN IT IS OPEN, AND IN THIS CASE, WE
###534 WILL SAY THIS IS WHEN THE PORE IS CLOSED. AND THEN WE
###537 WILL DIVIDE EACH OF THESE TWO SITUATIONS INTO THE
###541 GUARD CELL AND THE EPIDERMAL CELL. GUARD CELL AND THE
###550 EPIDERMAL CELL. NOW, IF WE WERE TO START TO PUT SOME
###557 VALUES ON THESE. AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO HAVE
###561 A SENSE OF FROM TODAY'S LECTURE. BECAUSE, THIS IS
###564 WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO NEED FOR THE WATER RELATIONS
###566 PROBLEMS. WE HAVE TO BEGIN BY HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING
###570 OF WHAT REALISTIC VALUES ARE WITH REGARD TO THESE
###573 VARIOUS COMPONENTS. PSI, PSI'S OF PI AND PSI'S OF P.
###577 SO LET'S LOOK FIRST AT THE SITUATION OF WHEN THE GUARD
###580 CELL IS CLOSED. WHEN THE PORE IS CLOSED. AT THAT
###582 PARTICULAR POINT THERE WOULD BE RELATIVELY LOW
###585 PRESSURE INSIDE OF THE CELLS. LOW PRESSURE. SO
###589 
###593 INSIDE THE GUARD CELL. NOW, HOW ABOUT THE TURGOR
###597 PRESSURE IN THE ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL. WHAT WOULD
###601 ITS TURGOR PRESSURE BE? THAT CELL WHICH IS RIGHT
###603 NEXT TO THE GUARD CELL. WELL, A REASONABLE VALUE LIKE
###607 BEFORE. THESE ARE 4 BARS OR 4 ATMOSPHERES. NOW HOW
###611 ABOUT THE SOLUTE POTENTIAL? THE SALTS THAT ARE
###616 INSIDE THE GUARD CELL. A REASONABLE VALUE WHEN IT IS
###621 CLOSED MIGHT BE CONCENTRATION 2. AND IN THE ADJACENT
###626 EPIDERMAL CELL, MAYBE CONCENTRATION 6, BECAUSE IT HAS
###629 MORE POTASSIUM AT THIS POINT. NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THE
###633 SITUATION WHEN THE GUARD CELL HAS BEEN OPENED. THAT
###636 IS, POTASSIUM HAS BEEN ACTIVELY MOVED ACROSS THE
###640 MEMBRANE FROM THE EPIDERMAL CELL INTO THE GUARD CELL.
###644 AT THIS POINT WE SAID THE GUARD CELL IS NOW GOING TO
###648 OPEN THE PORE, SO ITS TURGOR PRESSURE HAS HAD TO
###652 INCREASE. THIS IS A REASONABLE VALUE FOR THE TURGOR
###655 PRESSURE. IN THE ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL, BECAUSE WE
###659 
###662 DECREASED SOMEWHAT, BUT NOT A LOT. THESE ARE
###665 REASONABLE VALUES. AND NOW IF WE LOOK TO SEE WHAT HAS
###669 HAPPENED WITH REGARD TO PSI'S OF PI. THAT IS, THE
###672 SOLUTE POTENTIAL. AS A RESULT OF THE POTASSIUM BEING
###675 MOVED IN, A REASONABLE VALUE MIGHT BE CONCENTRATION 8.
###679 SO WE HAVE GONE FROM CONCENTRATION 2 TO CONCENTRATION
###681 8. WHERE DOES THIS POTASSIUM COME FROM? WELL, IT
###686 COMES FROM THE ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL. SO, THE
###690 ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL HAS GIVEN UP SOME OF ITS
###692 POTASSIUM AND IN THE PROCESS HAS NOW BECOME A LESS
###699 NEGATIVE WITH REGARD TO ITS SOLUTE POTENTIAL. NOW, WE
###703 HAVE ALL OF THE COMPONENTS WHICH ALLOW US TO CALCULATE
###707 THE WATER POTENTIAL. AND TO REMIND YOU OF THE
###710 EQUATION, PSI EQUALS PSI'S OF PI PLUS PSI'S OF P. SO,
###716 IF WE NOW CALCULATE THE WATER POTENTIAL FOR EACH OF
###719 THESE COLUMNS, WE HAVE GOT A 5, AND A NEGATIVE 8. THE
###724 OVERALL PSI OF THE GUARD CELL WHEN IT IS OPEN WOULD BE
###727 
###732 THE GUARD CELL IS OPEN THE OVERALL PSI FOR THE
###734 ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL WOULD BE 3 AND A NEGATIVE 4,
###738 WOULD BE CONCENTRATION 1. NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THE
###742 SITUATION WHEN IT IS CLOSED. WHEN IT IS CLOSED WE
###746 HAVE 1 AND A NEGATIVE 2 GIVE US CONCENTRATION 1. AND
###751 THE ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL WOULD BE CONCENTRATION 2.
###757 NOW, LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE SHOWN HERE. FIRST OF
###761 ALL, IN THE CLOSED SITUATION THE MORE NEGATIVE WATER
###766 POTENTIAL IN THE EPIDERMAL CELL KEEPS THE WATER
###770 WANTING TO BE MOSTLY IN THE ADJACENT EPIDERMAL CELL.
###774 NOT ON THE GUARD CELL AND HENCE THE TURGOR PRESSURE IS
###776 LOW. ONCE WE PUMP POTASSIUM FROM THE EPIDERMAL CELL
###781 INTO THE GUARD CELL AND INCREASE ITS SOLUTE POTENTIAL
###787 WE NOW CAN AFFECT THE WATER POTENTIAL OF THE GUARD
###791 CELL WHICH NOW BECOMES MORE NEGATIVE THAN THE
###794 EPIDERMAL CELL AND WATER NOW FLOWS THIS DIRECTION.
###799 THE MOVEMENT OF WATER THEN CAUSES AN INCREASE IN THE
###803 
###807 IN THE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE A OPENING AND CLOSING
###812 OF A GUARD CELL DUE TO A CHANGE OF TURGOR PRESSURE.
###816 KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT OF WATER
###819 IS DETERMINED NOT BY THESE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS, NOT
###822 BY PSI'S OF PI OR PSI'S OF P, BUT BY THE WATER
###826 POTENTIAL. THE NUMBER THAT YOU GET BY ADDING THE
###829 INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT. THIS DETERMINES THE DIRECTION
###831 THAT WATER MOVES. NOW, LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW MORE
###835 EXAMPLES OF THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. HERE IS
###838 A BEAKER OF WATER. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO THINK OF THIS
###841 BEAKER OF WATER IN TERMS OF PERHAPS EVEN BEING A LAKE.
###846 WE CAN ALSO HAVE A LAKE HERE. SO, LET'S SAY WE HAVE
###850 A LAKE OR A BEAKER OF WATER AND I AM GOING TO TELL YOU
###854 THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SOLUTES DISSOLVED BOTH IN THE
###858 BEAKER AND PERHAPS IN THE LAKE, AS WELL. WE CAN SAY
###862 THAT PSI'S OF PI FOR THE LAKE MIGHT BE CONCENTRATION
###867 4. AND FOR THE BEAKER WE WILL ALSO SAY PSI'S OF PI IS
###872 
###875 HAVE THE WATER POTENTIAL EQUATION, PSI EQUALS PSI'S OF
###878 PI PLUS PSI'S OF P. AND IF I ASK YOU AT THIS POINT,
###884 WHAT THEN WOULD BE THE WATER POTENTIAL OF THE WATER IN
###887 THIS OPEN BEAKER OR THE WATER IN THE LAKE? HOW COULD
###893 YOU FIGURE IT OUT BY HAVING ONLY ONE VALUE? THAT IS,
###897 BY ONLY KNOWING THAT THIS VALUE HERE IS CONCENTRATION
###901 4. AND THE ANSWER IS, THAT IN SITUATIONS WHERE YOU
###905 HAVE AN OPEN BODY OF WATER WHERE YOU HAVE NO MEMBRANE
###911 THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY TO BUILD UP TURGOR PRESSURE IN
###916 AN OPEN BODY. THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY TO BUILD UP
###918 TURGOR PRESSURE. SO, IN THE ABSENCE OF THE MEMBRANE
###926 AS YOU HAVE IN A LAKE OR A BEAKER OF WATER, PSI'S OF
###931 PI EQUALS ZERO. SO, THE WATER POTENTIAL IN THIS
###937 PARTICULAR CASE OF A LAKE OR THIS BEAKER EQUALS THE
###941 SOLUTE POTENTIAL. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THIS MEMBRANE
###944 THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD UP PRESSURE. NOW, UP
###949 FRONT HERE I HAVE SOME EXAMPLES OF A PLANT THAT SOME
###951 
###954 HAVE TORMENTED A PLANT LIKE THIS. THIS IS KNOWN AS
###957 A SENSITIVE PLANT. AND THE REASON THAT IT IS
###960 A SENSITIVE PLANT IS BECAUSE WHEN IT IS TOUCHED, AND I
###963 DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WILL DO IT NOW FOR US BECAUSE IT
###965 IS QUITE SHY. BUT, WHEN IT IS TOUCHED I DON'T KNOW IF
###967 MATT YOU CAN FOCUS ON THIS, THE LEAVES WILL CLOSE AND
###973 THEY WILL EVEN COLLAPSE SOMEWHAT. NOW, THIS CLOSURE
###978 OR THE COLLAPSE OF THE LEAVES PROBABLY SERVES SOME
###981 TYPE OF A PROTECTIVE MECHANISM AS A WAY OF REDUCING
###985 THE LEAF SURFACE PERHAPS WHEN AN ANIMAL LANDS ON THE
###987 LEAF. BUT, IT IS ALSO RELATED TO CHANGES IN WATER
###991 POTENTIAL. AND I WANT TO JUST BRIEFLY TELL YOU WHAT
###995 IS GOING ON IN THIS LEAF AND HOW IT IS RELATED TO
###997 WATER POTENTIAL. AND THEN MAYBE YOU COULD MAKE
###1000 A TABLE LIKE THIS FOR YOURSELF FOR THE LEAF. SO,
###1002 LET'S LOOK AT THE SENSITIVE PLANT. THE FIRST THING
###1008 THAT HAPPENS WITH TOUCH IS THAT IT, YOU STIMULATE OR
###1015 
###1023 BE MEASURED ON METERS. IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR US TO
###1026 PERCEIVE OURSELVES BUT IT IS A SMALL ELECTRIC CURRENT.
###1029 THIS RESULTS IN A MOVEMENT OF OUR SAME ION THAT WE SAW
###1039 ON THE STOMATA, A POTASSIUM FROM THE LEAF INTO THE
###1046 STEM. MOVEMENT OF POTASSIUM FROM THE LEAF IN THE
###1052 STEM. THIS THEN CAUSES THE PSI OF THE LEAF TO BECOME,
###1066 IN THIS CASE, MORE POSITIVE AND WATER LEAVES THE LEAF
###1073 AND GOES TO THE STEM. AND THE LEAF COLLAPSES.
###1085 THE LEAF COLLAPSES.
###1094 SO, HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF WATER BEING PRESSURE
###1099 OR POSITIVE PRESSURE OF THE WATER HOLDING THE LEAF UP
###1102 AND WHEN YOU CAUSE THAT PRESSURE TO DROP BY HAVING THE
###1105 POTASSIUM GO OUT, YOU CHANGE THE WATER POTENTIAL AND
###1108 THE WATER LEAVES AND THEN THE LEAFLET DROPS.
###1112 NOW, LET ME GIVE YOU A SITUATION WHICH IS
###1115 A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED. BUT, ACTUALLY PROBABLY
###1118 SUMMARIZES NICELY WHAT WE WILL SAY IN THIS LECTURE AND
###1121 
###1124 IS AN UNUSUAL SITUATION, BUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO THINK
###1127 ABOUT. I AM GOING TO DRAW TWO CELLS IN THIS
###1130 SITUATION. I AM GOING TO DRAW A PARENCHYMA CELL. WE
###1133 ARE ALSO GOING TO MAKE A TABLE AS WE HAD BEFORE. AND,
###1140 NEXT TO THIS PARENCHYMA CELL I AM GOING TO PUT A XYLEM
###1143 ELEMENT. A XYLEM ELEMENT. AND, FOR THIS PARTICULAR
###1152 XYLEM ELEMENT I AM GOING TO SAY THAT THEY ARE IN
###1156 EQUILIBRIUM
###1162 WITH REGARD TO PSI. THAT IS, PSI OF THE
###1169 XYLEM EQUALS THE PSI OF THE PARENCHYMA. AND NOW WHAT
###1177 I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO MAKE A TABLE JUST AS WE DID
###1184 FOR THE STOMATA TO CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS
###1189 COMPONENTS THAT ALLOW THESE TWO CELLS TO HAVE THE SAME
###1193 WATER POTENTIAL. SO, ON THIS PARTICULAR ONE, I THINK
###1197 I WILL JUST DO THE WHOLE THING DIFFERENTLY. ON THIS
###1199 PARTICULAR ONE, WE WILL PUT, WE WILL HAVE THE XYLEM
###1204 AND THE PARENCHYMA. AND WE WILL LOOK NOW AT THE THREE
###1211 ELEMENTS WHICH MAKE UP THE WATER POTENTIAL OF THESE
###1216 
###1223 PSI'S OF P.
###1225 NOW THE FIRST THING I WANT TO ASK YOU AND THIS
###1227 SHOULD BE IN YOUR MIND, IS WHAT IS THE REAL BASIC
###1230 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PARENCHYMA CELL AND THE XYLEM
###1232 CELL, THE VESSEL?
###1236 WHAT ABOUT THE XYLEM CELL? XYLEM CELL IS DEAD
###1240 COMPARED TO THE PARENCHYMA CELL. THE PARENCHYMA CELL
###1243 HAS THEREFORE, A MEMBRANE. IT IS ALIVE.
###1248 SO, THIS CELL IS ALIVE. THIS CELL IS DEAD.
###1256 AND YET I TOLD YOU THAT THESE TWO CELLS ARE IN
###1258 EQUILIBRIUM WITH REGARD TO THEIR WATER POTENTIALS.
###1262 HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE IF ONE IS ALIVE AND OF THEM IS
###1265 DEAD? ALL EQUILIBRIUM MEANS IS THAT THE WATER
###1268 POTENTIALS ARE THE SAME AND THAT THERE IS NO NET
###1272 MOVEMENT OF WATER. SO, LET'S BEGIN BECAUSE WE SAID
###1281 THAT THEY ARE AT EQUILIBRIUM. LET'S BEGIN BY PUTTING
###1283 ON NUMBERS FOR THE WATER POTENTIAL FOR BOTH THE XYLEM
###1287 
###1289 AND A REASONABLE NUMBER FROM BOTH CELLS IS
###1292 CONCENTRATION 8. CONCENTRATION 8 BARS FOR THE WATER
###1295 POTENTIAL. NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THE OTHER COMPONENTS
###1300 WHICH MAKE THIS UP. FIRST OF ALL, THE PARENCHYMA CELL
###1303 IS ALIVE. SO, BECAUSE IT IS ALIVE, IT IS GOING TO BE
###1308 ABLE TO CONCENTRATE SOME SALTS AND ALSO GOING TO BE
###1312 ABLE TO HAVE A TURGOR PRESSURE. SO, A REASONABLE
###1314 VALUE FOR THE SALTS IN A PARENCHYMA CELL ARE
###1317 CONCENTRATION 3. PLUS 3, CONCENTRATION 3, SORRY.
###1320 CONCENTRATION 3 FOR THE SALTS.
###1322 I HAVE THIS RIGHT OVER HERE. REASONABLE VALUE,
###1326 SORRY. REASONABLE VALUE TO THE SALTS IS CONCENTRATION
###1329 11 IN THE PARENCHYMA CELLS. THESE ARE CELLS NOW WHICH
###1332 CAN CONCENTRATE THEIR SOLUTES BECAUSE OF THEIR
###1336 MEMBRANE. NOW, THIS IS WHERE THE CHANGE IN YOUR
###1339 PERSPECTIVE HAS TO COME ABOUT. WHAT WOULD BE
###1342 A REASONABLE VALUE FOR THE CONCENTRATION OF THE SALTS
###1346 
###1351 NEGATIVE? LESS NEGATIVE. AND THE REASON IT IS LESS
###1355 NEGATIVE, THAT IS THE CORRECT ANSWER, IS BECAUSE THE
###1358 XYLEM CELL NOT HAVING A MEMBRANE CANNOT CONCENTRATE
###1362 SALTS. SO, THE SOLUTES IN THE XYLEM MORE OR LESS
###1367 REFLECT WHAT THE SALT CONCENTRATION IS IN THE SOIL, IN
###1370 THE WATER THAT IS COMING IN. IT CANNOT MAKE THE SALTS
###1373 ANY MORE CONCENTRATED. AND SO FOR THE XYLEM,
###1377 A REASONABLE VALUE FOR THE SALT CONCENTRATION IS, IT
###1381 IS NOT PURE, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY NOT AS HIGH AS
###1384 A CELL, BUT CAN CONCENTRATE IT. AND NOW, IF WE LOOK
###1391 AT THE LAST COMPONENT, PSI'S OF P, AND FOR BOTH THE
###1396 PARENCHYMA AND THE XYLEM, BECAUSE WE HAVE A LIVING
###1400 CELL WHICH IS CONCENTRATED SOLUTES WE CAN NOW DEVELOP
###1403 A TURGOR PRESSURE. SO, REASONABLE VALUE FOR THE
###1406 TURGOR PRESSURE WOULD BE 3. POSITIVE 3.
###1408 AND NOW, I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO SWITCH YOUR
###1413 THINKING AGAIN. WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE VALUE FOR
###1418 
###1422 BECAUSE IT IS DEAD IT CANNOT HAVE A TURGOR PRESSURE.
###1424 AND THIS CELL IS ALSO UNDER TENSION. AND YOU RECALL
###1428 LAST TIME THAT WE SAID PSI'S OF P CAN BE POSITIVE IN
###1431 TERMS OF TURGOR PRESSURE OR NEGATIVE WHEN THE WATER
###1435 COLUMN AS IT IS IN THE XYLEM IS BEING STRETCHED. SO,
###1439 WHAT WOULD BE THE STATE OF PSI'S OF P IN THE XYLEM?
###1443 A REASONABLE VALUE WOULD BE CONCENTRATION 7.5.
###1447 CONCENTRATION 7.5. SO, HERE WE HAVE A SITUATION IN
###1452 WHICH WE HAVE A NEGATIVE WATER, A NEGATIVE PSI'S OF P
###1457 IN A CELL DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO ONE WITH A POSITIVE
###1460 PSI'S OF P. BUT, NOW IF YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER PSI
###1464 EQUAL PSI'S OF PI PLUS PSI'S OF P YOU NOTICE THAT THE
###1469 PSI'S COME OUT TO BE THE SAME. THESE CELLS ARE AT
###1473 EQUILIBRIUM WITH REGARD TO THEIR WATER POTENTIAL, BUT
###1476 NOT WITH REGARD TO THE COMPONENTS THAT MAKE UP THE
###1479 WATER POTENTIAL. AND THAT IS WHY THE MOVEMENT OF
###1483 WATER IS DETERMINED BY THIS NUMBER, THE WATER
###1488 WHICH YOU
###1489 MIGHT GET ONLY FOR THE TURGOR PRESSURE OR FOR THE
###1492 SOLUTE POTENTIAL. FINALLY, BEFORE MOVING ON I WANT TO
###1496 RETURN TO A PICTURE WHICH WE PUT UP ON THE BOARD, AND
###1500 THAT PICTURE HAD TO DO WITH THE PLUMBING SYSTEM OF THE
###1503 PLANT. JUST TO REVIEW A POINT THAT WE MENTIONED LAST
###1507 TIME. IF WE LOOK AT THE PLUMBING SYSTEM OF THE PLANT
###1511 NOW AND WE PUT ON VALUES FOR PSI, FOR THE ATMOSPHERE
###1520 ON A DRY DAY WHEN THERE IS NOT MUCH WATER IN THE
###1524 ATMOSPHERE, PSI MIGHT EQUAL CONCENTRATION 40. PRETTY
###1528 LOW NUMBER. IF WE LOOK AT THE PSI'S OF NOW THE
###1533 TISSUES WHICH MAKE UP THE STEM, THE PSI FOR THE LEAF
###1538 MIGHT EQUAL CONCENTRATION 8, NOT AN UNREASONABLE
###1541 VALUE. FOR THE STEM, PSI EQUALS PERHAPS CONCENTRATION
###1547 5. AND MAYBE FOR THE ROOTS PSI EQUALS MAYBE
###1553 CONCENTRATION 2 OR 3. CONCENTRATION 2 OR 3. SO, WHAT
###1557 I WANT YOU TO NOTICE HERE AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
###1560 TAKE HOME MESSAGE, IS THAT, I WILL WRITE IT OUT FOR
###1563 
###1576 NEGATIVE PSI'S. SO IN A PLANT TRANSPIRATION OCCURS,
###1592 WE SAID, BECAUSE OF THE PULL OF THE WATER MOLECULES.
###1595 BECAUSE THIS PULLS THEM UP TO THE TOP, BUT REALLY IT
###1598 OCCURS BECAUSE OF THIS GRADIENT INSIDE GOING FROM THE
###1602 SOIL UP TO THE ATMOSPHERE WITH THE PLANT BEING THE
###1605 SORT OF INTERMEDIATE PATHWAY THAT ALLOWS FOR
###1609 TRANSPIRATION TO OCCUR. HAVING TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE
###1614 XYLEM I WANTED TO JUST MENTION TO YOU THE OTHER
###1616 TRANSPORT SYSTEM THAT A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE ALREADY
###1619 ASKED ME ABOUT. AND THAT IS THE PHLOEM. THE XYLEM,
###1623 WHICH WE SAID IS THE PRIMARY TRANSPORT SYSTEM FOR
###1626 WATER. THE PHLOEM IS THE PRIMARY TRANSPORT SYSTEM FOR
###1631 SUGARS, FOR FIXED PHOTOSYNTHATE. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST
###1635 BRIEFLY MENTION TO YOU HOW THE PHLOEM WORKS AND THEN
###1638 WE CAN SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING AT SOME INTERESTING
###1640 PICTURES THAT I THINK YOU WILL ENJOY LOOKING AT. SO,
###1643 LET'S LOOK AT THE MAIN ELEMENT OF THE PHLOEM, WHICH IS
###1646 
###1653 BECAUSE THE XYLEM AND PHLOEM ARE
###1654 CLOSELY ASSOCIATED AS YOU REMEMBERED SEEING IN BASKET
###1657 OR BUNDLES, NEXT TO IT WE WOULD HAVE A XYLEM ELEMENT.
###1665 NOW, THE SUGARS ARE NOT MADE IN THE SIEVE ELEMENT.
###1667 THEY ARE JUST TRANSPORTED IN THE SIEVE ELEMENT SO THE
###1670 LAST COMPONENT WHICH WE HAVE TO PUT ON HERE IS THE
###1673 LEAF CELL WHERE SUGARS ARE MADE. NOW BEFORE WE GO
###1685 THROUGH THE STEPS TO INDICATE TO YOU HOW SUGARS ARE
###1689 MOVED IN THE PHLOEM, I HAVE TO AGAIN POINT OUT TO YOU
###1691 A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF. AND
###1694 THOSE MAIN ASPECTS ARE THAT THE LEAF CELL AND THE
###1698 SIEVE ELEMENT ARE BOTH ALIVE. BOTH HAVE MEMBRANES.
###1704 SO, LET'S NOW CONSIDER THE STEPS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN
###1716 THE MOVEMENT OF SUGARS IN THE PHLOEM AND HOW THE
###1719 PHLOEM WORKS TO TRANSPORT THE SUGARS. THE FIRST THING
###1725 THAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE SUGARS ARE MOVED INTO THE
###1733 PHLOEM.
###1740 AND THIS MOVEMENT INTO THE PHLOEM TAKES PLACE
###1742 ACROSS A MEMBRANE AND PEOPLE CALL THIS MOVEMENT
###1751 ARE LOADED
###1752 FROM IS A LEAF, THE LEAF IS CALLED A SOURCE. SO,
###1761 SUGARS ARE MOVED INTO THE PHLOEM. WE HAVE SUGARS,
###1766 THEY ARE LOADING. THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS IS THAT
###1775 WE NOW HAVE MADE THE PSI OF THE PHLOEM MORE NEGATIVE.
###1787 BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE SOLUTES THERE NOW. MORE
###1790 NEGATIVE. THIS RESULTS IN WATER ENTERING THE PHLOEM
###1804 AT THE TOP, AT THE SOURCE LET'S SAY. AND THE WATER
###1810 COMES FROM THE XYLEM.
###1820 SO, IN THIS SITUATION AFTER THE
###1822 SUGARS ARE LOADED IN TO THE SIEVE ELEMENT WE HAVE
###1827 WATER MOVING IN BECAUSE OF A CHANGE IN WATER
###1830 POTENTIAL.
###1836 BECAUSE THE PHLOEM IS ALIVE NOW, WE NOW
###1839 HAVE A INCREASE IN PRESSURE AT THE SITE OF LOADING.
###1849 THE SITE OF LOADING.
###1853 AND THIS IS REALLY NOW HOW THE PHLOEM WORKS.
###1855 WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS YOUR GARDEN
###1858 HOSE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE AT HOME. IN THE GARDEN HOSE,
###1861 AT ONE END OF THE HOSE YOU HAVE THE PRESSURE, WHICH IS
###1864 
###1867 YOU HAVE AN OPENING OF THE HOSE AND THE WATER COMES
###1870 OUT, SO IF YOU COULD PUT A BLUE DROP OF DYE IN THE
###1873 WATER AT THE PLACE THE HOSE IS ATTACHED TO THE FAUCET,
###1876 YOU WOULD FIND THAT THAT BLUE DROP OF DYE WOULD MOVE
###1879 DOWN. THE MOVEMENT IN THE PHLOEM OCCURS EXACTLY THE
###1883 SAME WAY. THE INCREASE IN PRESSURE ESSENTIALLY PUSHES
###1888 THE SUGARS DOWN AND THIS PUSHING OF THE SUGAR DOWN IS
###1892 KNOWN AS MASS FLOW.
###1901 BUT, EVENTUALLY THE PHLOEM SHOULD
###1903 JUST CLOG UP. I MEAN YOU ARE JUST GOING TO BE PUSHING
###1905 THE SUGARS DOWN AND EVENTUALLY THE WHOLE PHLOEM SHOULD
###1907 BE FULL OF SUGAR. WELL, THE LAST STEP IN THE PROCESS
###1912 IS THAT AT THE BASE, WHICH I HAVE DRAWN HERE. AT THE
###1917 BASE, WE HAVE UNLOADING.
###1925 UNLOADING. AND, YOU COULD
###1928 VIEW THAT UNLOADING AT BEING A PARENCHYMA CELL. IT
###1934 MIGHT BE, FOR EXAMPLE, A TUBER, LIKE A POTATO TUBER,
###1937 OR IT MIGHT BE A ROOT, LIKE A BEET ROOT, WHICH IS VERY
###1941 SWEET. THE SUGARS ARE NOW ACTIVELY MOVED ACROSS.
###1950 AS SOON AS
###1951 THAT HAPPENS, THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE WATER TO STAY
###1954 HERE ANY MORE. BECAUSE, THE WATER POTENTIAL HAS
###1957 CHANGED AND THE WATER THEN MOVED BACK INTO THE XYLEM.
###1962 AND THIS IS RESULTED IN A DROP IN THE PRESSURE.
###1965 RESULTS IN A REDUCTION OF THE PRESSURE AT THE BASE.
###1968 SO, THE
###1984 PHLOEM WORKS BY ESSENTIALLY HAVING A PRESSURE
###1987 GRADIENT. PRESSURE IS HIGH AT THE TOP BECAUSE SUGARS
###1990 ARE LOADED IN. WATER COMES IN AT THE TOP. THAT WATER
###1993 CARRIES THE SUGARS DOWN TO THE BOTTOM. THE SUGARS ARE
###1996 REMOVED. THE PRESSURE DROPS. IT IS THE SAME AS YOUR
###1999 GARDEN HOSE. SO, THE PHLOEM IS UNDER PRESSURE. ALL
###2003 OF YOU HAVE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED THIS PRESSURE WHETHER
###2006 YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT IN THE PHLOEM. IF YOU CUT A
###2009 PLANT FROM THE STEM FOR A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME THE
###2012 PLANT WILL BLEED. THIS BLEEDING IS THE LIQUID WHICH
###2015 IS BEING PUSHED OUT IN THE PHLOEM. BUT, A WAY THAT
###2018 PERHAPS MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS, AND I WILL
###2020 
###2023 THE COMPUTER TO WORK, IS THAT IF YOU WALK DOWN STREETS
###2027 ON A WARM SUMMER DAY AND YOUR FEET STICK TO THE
###2032 STREET, YOUR FEET IS STICKING TO MATERIAL WHICH HAS
###2036 ACTUALLY COME OUT OF THE TREES AND HAS BEEN EXUDED BY
###2040 THE TREES AS DROPLETS. AND, IT COLLECTS ON THE
###2043 WINDSHIELDS OF YOUR CAR OR ON THE SIDEWALKS AND IT IS
###2047 REALLY SUGAR. AND THAT IS WHY YOUR FEET STICK TO IT.
###2050 NOW, HOW DOES THAT LIQUID GET OUT? THIS NEXT SLIDE
###2054 WILL SHOW YOU HOW THE LIQUID GETS OUT. SO, ONE OF THE
###2057 THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS THAT APHIDS LIKE TO FEED ON
###2061 PLANTS AND APHIDS ARE VERY GOOD IN THE FACT THAT THEY
###2065 CAN TAKE THEIR STYLET, THE THING THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS
###2068 THEM TO FEED ON THE PLANTS AND THEY CAN INSERT IT
###2071 DIRECTLY INTO THE PHLOEM. SO HERE IS THE APHID STYLET
###2074 WHICH IS ON THE OUTSIDE. THIS IS A CROSS SECTION OF
###2077 A TREE. YOU ALL SHOULD RECOGNIZE THIS AS THE BARK.
###2080 AND THE APHID IS ABLE, WE ARE NOT SURE HOW IT IS ABLE
###2083 
###2086 ALL OF THE OLDER PHLOEM UNTIL IT REACHES THE NEWEST
###2089 AND MOST ACTIVELY TRANSPORTING LAYER OF PHLOEM. AND
###2092 HERE IS THE STYLET INSIDE OF A SIEVE ELEMENT. NOW,
###2096 ONCE IN THIS SIEVE ELEMENT WE SAID THAT THE MATERIAL
###2100 IN THE PHLOEM IS UNDER PRESSURE. AND IT IS UNDER
###2102 PRESSURE BECAUSE OF THIS MASS FLOW. BECAUSE OF THE
###2104 TURGOR PRESSURE. AND SO LIQUID IS ESSENTIALLY PUMPED
###2108 UP THROUGH THE APHID. THE APHID JUST SITS THERE AND
###2110 LET'S THE LIQUID GO THROUGH IT AND THE DROPLET OF THE
###2114 LIQUID EXUDES THROUGH THE APHID AND THIS DROPLET
###2118 ACTUALLY CONTAINS THE SUGARS. THE APHID HAS TAKEN OUT
###2121 SOME MATERIAL FROM THE LIQUID AS IT HAS GONE THROUGH
###2126 ITS BODY BUT IT CAN'T TAKE OUT ALL OF THE SUGARS SO
###2128 THE DROPLET WHICH FALLS ON TO THE GROUND OR ON TO YOUR
###2131 WINDSHIELD STILL CONTAINS A LOT OF SUGARS AND IS
###2134 ACTUALLY QUITE NUTRITIOUS. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
###2137 HAVE A BIBLICAL OR A HISTORICAL BENT, IT IS THOUGHT
###2141 
###2144 SUPPOSEDLY CALLED MANA. IT WAS THE SUGAR (INAUDIBLE)
###2148 WHICH CAME FROM THE APHIDS. FINALLY IN THE LAST TEN
###2153 OR FIFTEEN MINUTES I WANT TO BRING UP A TOPIC THAT I
###2155 GET MORE QUESTIONS ON FROM YOU THAN ANY OTHER TOPIC IN
###2159 THIS CLASS. PROBABLY BECAUSE IT IS ONE THAT HAS THE
###2162 GREATEST PRACTICAL VALUE, AT LEAST WHAT I THINK OF IT.
###2165 AND THAT QUESTION IS, HERE IS THE PLANT THAT IS
###2168 GROWING IN MY DORM. IT LOOKS REALLY CRUMMY. WHAT IS
###2171 WRONG WITH THIS PLANT? CAN YOU HELP ME FIGURE OUT
###2174 WHAT IS GOING ON SO I CAN MAKE MY PLANTS LOOK BETTER
###2176 AND MY ROOMMATES WON'T THINK SO POORLY OF ME. ALL
###2179 RIGHT? NOW, ASSUMING THAT THE PLANT DOESN'T HAVE
###2183 A DISEASE LIKE A PATHOGEN OR A FUNGAL DISEASE OR AN
###2186 INSECT THAT IS EATING IT. IN MOST CASES WHEN PLANTS
###2189 LOOK BAD, IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE SUFFERING FROM
###2192 A DEFICIENCY OF SOME ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT OR MINERAL
###2196 THAT THE SOIL PROVIDES. WE SAID WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT
###2200 
###2210 THAT ALL PLANTS BASICALLY COULD LIVE AS LONG AS THEY
###2213 ARE PROVIDED ONE ADDITIONAL COMPONENT OR COMPONENTS.
###2216 AND THOSE COMPONENTS ARE MINERALS FROM THE SOIL. AND
###2225 SO, I WOULD LIKE TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME OF THESE
###2227 NUTRIENTS AND MINERALS. MANY OF THEM ARE ONES THAT
###2230 YOU HAVE HEARD OF BEFORE. I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN
###2233 EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAPPENED. LET'S TALK ABOUT A PLANT
###2237 WHICH YOU BUY IN A NURSERY AND THE PLANT LOOKS REALLY
###2243 GOOD FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. AND THEN AS THE PLANT
###2246 GROWS IT STARTS TO SHOW SOME SIGNS OF LOOKING POORLY.
###2252 THOSE POOR SIGNS ARE BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY MISSING AN
###2255 ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT OR ESSENTIAL MINERAL. NOW WHAT WE
###2258 WANT TO DO IS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE ESSENTIAL
###2261 NUTRIENTS OR MINERALS ARE THAT THE PLANT GETS FROM THE
###2265 SOIL. AND THE FIRST THING WE SHOULD SAY IS THAT AN
###2267 ESSENTIAL MINERAL OR PROBABLY THE BEST WORD IS
###2275 ELEMENT, AS YOU WILL SEE IN THE CHEMICAL SENSE.
###2287 PREVENT A
###2288 PLANT FROM COMPLETING ITS LIFE CYCLE. BUT, IT IS VERY
###2308 RARE THAT AN ELEMENT IS TOTALLY ABSENT. IT USUALLY IS
###2311 PRESENT IN SUBOPTIMAL AMOUNTS. AND THE SUBOPTIMAL
###2315 AMOUNT ALLOWS THE PLANT TO GROW BUT THE PLANT LOOKS
###2318 SICK. SO SUBOPTIMAL AMOUNTS
###2329 RESULT IN WHAT WE KNOW OF
###2332 AS DEFICIENCY DISEASES.
###2339 AND THIS IS THE MOST COMMON
###2340 SORTS OF THINGS THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR DORM PLANTS.
###2343 THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IS NOT TOTALLY ABSENT BUT IT IS
###2347 PRESENT IN SUBOPTIMAL AMOUNTS AND THE PLANT JUST CAN'T
###2350 MANAGE THAT WELL. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THESE
###2352 ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS OR MINERALS ARE. THERE AREN'T
###2356 THAT MANY, SURPRISINGLY. BUT THEY ARE PROBABLY BEST
###2360 APPROACHED BY ASKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT IN WHICH THEY
###2364 ARE NEEDED. BIOLOGISTS, AND A LOT OF THIS WORK IN
###2368 DESCRIBING AND FINDING OUT WHAT THESE ESSENTIAL
###2370 ELEMENTS WERE OR ARE WAS DONE HERE AT BERKELEY IN THE
###2373 30'S AND THE 40'S AND ALSO AT DAVIS BY A MAN
###2380 ELEMENTS. THEY ARE USUALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS.
###2386 THOSE THAT ARE NEEDED IN LARGE AMOUNTS, SUCH AS 1 TO 4
###2397 PERCENT OF THE DRY WEIGHT OF A PLANT. AND THESE THAT
###2408 ARE NEEDED IN SUCH LARGE AMOUNTS ARE KNOWN AS MACRO
###2411 NUTRIENTS.
###2416 AND THIS IS CONTRASTED WITH THOSE NEEDED
###2423 IN SMALL AMOUNTS. OFTEN THE AMOUNTS ARE VANISHINGLY
###2429 SMALL, TINY, TINY AMOUNTS. AND THESE ARE KNOWN AS
###2432 MICRONUTRIENTS.
###2439 IN GENERAL, THE MICRONUTRIENTS ARE
###2441 ELEMENTS WHICH ARE INVOLVED AS COFACTORS, COFACTORS ON
###2448 MANY ENZYMATIC CREATIONS SOMETIMES INVOLVED IN
###2451 ELECTRON TRANSPORT.
###2458 SO THEY ARE NEEDED IN TINY
###2459 AMOUNTS BECAUSE THEY ARE RECYCLED, REUSED OVER AND
###2462 OVER AGAIN. LET'S TALK NOW ABOUT WHAT THESE TWO
###2468 CLASSES INCLUDE. AND LET'S FIRST LOOK AT THE MACRO
###2471 NUTRIENTS AND WHAT ELEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE NEEDS
###2474 IN VERY LARGE AMOUNTS. ASIDE FROM CARBON, HYDROGEN
###2481 AND OXYGEN, WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY NEEDED FOR ALL LIVING
###2484 
###2493 SULFUR, CALCIUM, IRON AND MAGNESIUM. THESE ARE THE
###2503 MACRO NUTRIENTS. THEY ARE NEEDED IN HIGH AMOUNTS.
###2510 AND AN EASY WAY OF REMEMBERING THIS, IF YOU WANT TO
###2513 REMEMBER IT, IS "SEE HOPKIN'S CAFE MANAGER" SEE
###2517 HOPKIN'S CAFE MANAGER. THESE ARE THE MACRO NUTRIENTS.
###2520 THIS IS AS OPPOSED TO THE MICRONUTRIENTS WHICH
###2523 INCLUDE; COPPER, ZINC, MOLYBDENUM, BORON, CHLORIDE.
###2535 THESE ARE GENERALLY NEEDED IN TINY, TINY AMOUNTS. AND
###2538 IN SOME PLANTS, AS THE EXAMPLE I HAVE UP HERE, THERE
###2542 ARE SOMETIMES OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH ARE NEEDED
###2544 SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PLANT. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME PLANTS
###2548 NEED SILICA OR SILICON. AND THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE UP
###2554 HERE OF A PLANT THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN THE LAB.
###2557 THIS IS EQUISETUM OR SCOURING REED. AND THE REASON IT
###2560 FEELS SO GRITTY IS BECAUSE IT HAS INCLUDED SILICA IN
###2564 ITS CELL WALLS. SO SILICA IS NECESSARY FOR THIS
###2567 PLANT. BUT IN GENERAL IT IS NOT A NUTRIENT NEEDED BY
###2570 
###2575 SAID, ARE NEEDED FOR A PLANT TO COMPLETE ITS LIFE
###2577 CYCLE. IF YOU HAVE A PLANT YOU'RE WONDERING, WHAT
###2583 ELEMENT IS MISSING FROM ITS REGIME? WHY IS THIS
###2587 PLANT SUFFERING FROM A DEFICIENCY OR IS IT
###2590 SUFFICIENTING FROM A DEFICIENCY DISEASE? WHAT YOU
###2592 WANT TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR PLANT AND ASK
###2594 YOURSELF ARE THE YOUNGEST LEAVES IN BAD SHAPE OR ARE
###2598 THE OLDEST LEAVES IN BAD SHAPE? SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK
###2600 AT A PLANT, WHICH IS GROWING IN A POT HERE, AND LET'S
###2604 JUST SAY WHEN YOU BOUGHT THE PLANT YOU HAD ONE SET OF
###2608 LEAVES ON THE PLANT. SO, WE WILL JUST CALL THESE
###2611 LEAVES 1. NOW YOU HAVE LET THE PLANT GO FOR SOME TIME
###2616 AND NOW YOU HAVE TWO SETS OF LEAVES ON THE PLANT.
###2622 HERE IS THE LEAF 1. THEY ARE THE SAME LEAVES THAT
###2624 WERE PRESENT WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT. NOW WE HAVE LEAF 2'S
###2627 WHICH HAVE BEEN PRODUCED SINCE YOU HAD THE PLANT. AND
###2630 NOW LET'S LET THE PLANT GROW A LITTLE BIT LONGER. AND
###2633 
###2640 HERE IS OUR FIRST THING
###2641 WHICH WAS PRESENT WHEN YOU BOUGHT THE PLANT. THE
###2643 SECOND AND THEN THE THIRD, WHICH WERE PRODUCED WHEN
###2647 YOU HAD THE PLANT IN YOUR DORM ROOM. NOW, IF YOU HAVE
###2651 A PLANT IN YOUR DORM ROOM AND IT IS NOT LOOKING GOOD
###2654 THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO ASK YOURSELF IS; WHICH
###2657 LEAVES LOOK THE WORST? DO THE OLDER LEAVES LOOK BAD
###2662 OR DO THE NEWER LEAVES LOOK BAD? AND BY DECIDING
###2666 WHICH LEAF LOOKS BAD YOU CAN BEGIN TO NARROW DOWN
###2669 WHICH NUTRIENT OR WHICH MINERAL MIGHT BE MISSING FROM
###2673 THE SOIL. NOW, HOW IS THAT USEFUL? AND HOW IS THAT
###2677 EXPLAINED? IT IS EXPLAINED IN THE FOLLOWING
###2680 WAY; LET'S SAY YOU HAD A NUTRIENT AND THIS
###2683 NUTRIENT RAN OUT OF THE SOIL. IT WAS PRESENT IN THE
###2685 BEGINNING AND AS THE PLANT GREW THE NEWER LEAVES
###2689 STARTED LOOKING BAD. WHAT WE CAN CONCLUDE THEN IS
###2693 THAT THAT NUTRIENT THAT YOU PROVIDED THE PLANT ONCE IT
###2696 IS USED BY THE PLANT IT IS ESSENTIALLY TRAPPED IN THE
###2700 
###2706 IN THE PLACE THAT IT WAS USED. THEREFORE, AS THE
###2709 PLANT CONTINUES TO GROW AND THE NUTRIENT IS EXHAUSTED
###2713 FROM THE SOIL THAT ELEMENT CAN'T MOVE. IT IS TRAPPED
###2717 WHERE IT WAS FIRST PUT. AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF
###2720 CALCIUM. FOR EXAMPLE, ONCE CALCIUM IS USED BY THE
###2723 PLANT IT CAN'T BE MOVED. THIS IS AS OPPOSED TO
###2727 A SITUATION WHERE YOUR PLANT WITH TREE LEAVES, IF YOU
###2731 LOOK AT IT, NOW THE OLDER LEAVES LOOK BAD. AND THE
###2735 NEWER LEAVES LOOK JUST GREAT OR THEY LOOK BETTER THAN
###2737 THE ONES ON THE BOTTOM. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WHAT
###2741 THIS IS TELLING YOU IS THAT THIS NUTRIENT IS MOBILE.
###2745 IT IS ABLE TO MOVE FROM THE LEAVES THAT IT WAS IN
###2751 ORIGINALLY TO NEWER LEAVES. IT IS MOBILE. SO, IN THE
###2757 MOBILE CASE THE NEWER LEAVES LOOK BEST.
###2770 AND FINALLY
###2771 BEFORE I SHOW YOU SOME SLIDES, I WANTED TO MENTION TO
###2774 YOU THAT VERY OFTEN IF YOU GO TO THE STORE
###2778 TO BUY FERTILIZER FOR PLANTS YOU WILL FIND A NUMBER
###2781 
###2784 BE 16, 12, 8 OR IT COULD BE 3, 9, 16. THESE ARE CODES
###2795 NOT FOR THE NURSERY TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN THEMSELVES
###2798 BUT TO TELL YOU WHAT THE RATIO OF CERTAIN MACRO
###2802 NUTRIENTS ARE IN THE FERTILIZER THAT YOU ARE BUYING.
###2805 SO, THESE STAND FOR POTASSIUM, PHOSPHORUS AND
###2809 NITROGEN. THEIR CONCENTRATION IN THE FERTILIZERS.
###2812 AND THIS WILL BE AN INDICATION BECAUSE CERTAIN
###2816 FERTILIZERS YOU BUY FOR CERTAIN PLANTS DEPENDING UPON
###2819 THE RATIO OF THESE MACRO NUTRIENTS. LET ME SHOW YOU
###2822 NOW SOME SLIDES TO ILLUSTRATE TO YOU THESE VARIOUS
###2826 MINERAL DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS. THIS IS THE WAY THESE
###2828 EXPERIMENTS ARE RUN. AND YOU ARE GOING TO DO THIS IN
###2831 LAB THE WEEK AFTER NEXT. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE
###2833 A SERIES OF JARS AND INTO THESE JARS NUTRIENTS ARE
###2836 EITHER ADDED OR THE PLANT IS GROWN IN THE JAR WITH
###2839 A NUTRIENT LACKING. HERE IS THE CONTROL PLANT OVER
###2842 HERE IN A COMPLETE SOLUTION OF MICRO AND MACRO
###2848 WHICH
###2848 ARE MISSING AS WE GO FURTHER DOWN. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE
###2852 OF MINUS POTASSIUM, WHEN POTASSIUM RUNS OUT. NOTICE
###2855 IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THAT IT IS THE NEWEST LEAVES
###2860 WHICH LOOK GREAT. SO THIS MEANS THAT THIS NUTRIENT
###2863 WHEN IT RAN OUT WAS A MOBILE NUTRIENT. IT WAS MOVED
###2865 UP FROM THE OLDER LEAVES UP TO THE TOP OF THE PLANT.
###2869 HERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A NUTRIENT WHICH IS MOBILE,
###2872 MAGNESIUM. IT IS MOVED IN THE OLDEST LEAVES, WHICH
###2875 LOOK BAD, UP TO THE NEWEST LEAVES ON THE TOP. HERE
###2879 ARE NOW PLANTS LACKING CALCIUM. IN THIS PARTICULAR
###2882 CASE WE SAID CALCIUM WAS NOT MOBILE, IT IS IMMOBILE.
###2885 SO, THE OLDER LEAVES, THEY DON'T LOOK GREAT BUT THEY
###2888 AT LEAST ARE GREEN. WHEREAS, THE NEWER LEAVES ARE THE
###2890 ONES WHICH SHOW THE EFFECTS FIRST. SO, LOOK AT YOUR
###2894 PLANTS IN THAT WAY. HERE ARE PLANTS NOW WHICH ARE
###2896 MINUS IRON. IRON IS A FUNNY NUTRIENT. IT IS SAID TO
###2900 BE SEMI-MOBILE. SO THAT IF YOU LOOK AT A PLANT
###2904 VERY COMMON
###2904 TRAIT HERE IN CALIFORNIA, THE VEIN IS GREEN BUT THE
###2907 BLADE ITSELF IS WHITE. NOW HERE IS SOME PROBLEMS THAT
###2912 FARMERS HAVE. IF YOU GROW TOMATOES AND THE SOIL IS
###2915 LOW IN COPPER OR ZINC, THESE TWO MICRONUTRIENTS, YOU
###2918 GREATLY AFFECT THE FORM OF THE PLANT. HERE IS
###2921 BROCCOLI. BROCCOLI GROWN IN SOIL WHICH IS LACKING OR
###2925 VERY LOW IN MOLYBDENUM DOES NOT PRODUCE THE BROCCOLI
###2928 FLOWERS AND IT IS SO CALLED WHIP TAIL BROCCOLI. HERE
###2931 ARE PEAS NOW WHICH ARE GROWN IN SOIL WITH A TOO LOW OF
###2935 LEVEL OF COPPER. REMEMBER COPPER IS A MICRONUTRIENT.
###2938 AND IN THIS CASE THE OVULES FAIL TO DEVELOP. HERE ARE
###2943 CARNATIONS NOW GROWN MINUS BORON. THIS IS A BIG
###2946 PROBLEM FOR CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE WE GROW A LOT OF
###2948 CARNATIONS. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE
###2950 ENOUGH BORON OR IN THE MEDIUM. HERE ARE APPLES GROWN
###2954 IN A BORON FREE MEDIUM IN WHICH CASE YOU CAN SEE THE
###2957 APPLES ALSO ARE NOT PARTICULARLY GREAT SHAPE. GRAPES
###2960 
###2964 POINT OUT TO YOU IS THAT WE HAVE THESE VARIOUS
###2968 DEFICIENCY DISEASES. THEY CAN EASILY BE LOOKED AT
###2971 DEPENDING UPON HOW YOU ANALYZE THE TISSUE. NOW,
###2975 FINALLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU ABOUT THE EXAM IS
###2977 THAT THE MIDTERM HAS 35 QUESTIONS ON IT. SO, MOST OF
###2983 THEM ARE WORTH 3 POINTS. THERE ARE 2 POINTS EACH.
###2986 AND I WANT TO JUST TELL YOU THE BIGGEST MISTAKE THE
###2987 STUDENTS MAKE ABOUT THE QUESTIONS. I HAVE ALREADY
###2989 ENCOUNTERED THIS IN TALKING TO SOME OF YOU ABOUT THE
###2991 SAMPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE POSTED ON THE WEB PAGE.
###2995 THE BIGGEST MISTAKE YOU MAKE IS NUMBER 1, YOU DON'T
###2997 READ ALL OF THE ANSWERS FIRST. WE ASK YOU CHOOSE THE
###3000 BEST ANSWER. NOT THE ANSWER WHICH CONTAINS SOME
###3004 CORRECT INFORMATION, BUT THE ANSWER WHICH CONTAINS ALL
###3007 OF THE CORRECT INFORMATION. SO, READ ALL OF THE
###3009 ANSWERS FIRST. SECONDLY, THE OTHER MISTAKE YOU MAKE
###3013 AND IT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR, IS YOU READ TOO MUCH INTO
###3016 
###3020 A POORLY DEVELOPED EMBRYO, YOU KNOW THAT IT HAS A SEED
###3024 COAT. YOU KNOW THAT DOUBLE FERTILIZATION OCCURRED.
###3027 DON'T EXPECT TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS
###3029 PARTHENOCARPIC OR WHETHER THERE IS SOMETHING WHICH HAS
###3032 HAPPENED TO VIVIPARY. THAT IS NOT STATED IN THE
###3034 QUESTION. ONLY READ WHAT IS IN THE QUESTION. DON'T
###3037 ADD MORE TO THE QUESTION. DON'T READ MORE INTO THE
###3040 QUESTION BECAUSE IF YOU DO, YOU WILL MAKE IT HARDER
###3042 FOR YOURSELF. I THINK THAT THE QUESTIONS ARE PRETTY
###3044 STRAIGHTFORWARD. AND I THINK THAT IF YOU
###3046 UNDERSTAND ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS, IF YOU ARE ABLE
###3050 TO UNDERSTAND THE LIFE CYCLE PRETTY WELL, HOW THE
###3053 ENDODERMIS WORKS, YOU SHOULD DO PRETTY WELL ON THIS
###3056 EXAM. SECONDARY AND PRIMARY GROWTH ARE THE OTHER
###3059 FEATURES WE WILL STRESS. SO, WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS
###3062 TO COME TO THE REVIEW SESSION. ARE THEIR QUESTIONS
###3067 DECIDED TO TRICK YOU? NOT INTENTIONALLY. I WANT YOU
###3070 
###3072 TUESDAY NIGHT.
