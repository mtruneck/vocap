CARL AZUZ, ANCHOR, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Hi Everyone,
I`m Carl Azuz, news out of South America leading


2
0:0:15,6 --> 0:0:21,259
off today`s show. Hugo Chavez, the longtime
leader of Venezuela has died. Chavez was born


3
0:0:21,259 --> 0:0:27,39
in Venezuela in 1954. In 1998 he was elected
president, the youngest one in Venezuela`s


4
0:0:27,39 --> 0:0:34,15
history. He was reelected in 2000, 2006, and
2012. Chavez was controversial. He spoke out


5
0:0:34,15 --> 0:0:35,9
against the United States and other countries.


6
0:0:35,9 --> 0:0:40,51
He had been fighting cancer in recent years,
traveling to Cuba for medical treatments.


7
0:0:40,51 --> 0:0:44,55
Venezuela`s vice president announced the death
of Hugo Chavez yesterday afternoon.


8
0:0:44,55 --> 0:0:49,379
Next up today, we`re turning to Wall Street.
A new record set yesterday by the Dow Jones


9
0:0:49,379 --> 0:0:54,659
Industrial Average. The Dow, not the entire
stock market. It`s a group of about 30 major


10
0:0:54,659 --> 0:0:59,33
stocks, but it gives an idea of how the entire
stock market is doing. Here`s a look at the


11
0:0:59,33 --> 0:1:5,61
last several years. In 2007, the Dow started
dropping, it bottomed out in 2009, and it


12
0:1:5,61 --> 0:1:10,49
started going back up. Yesterday, when the
stock market closed, the Dow was at a new


13
0:1:10,49 --> 0:1:15,56
all-time high. The Dow is one factor that
experts use to figure out how the entire country


14
0:1:15,56 --> 0:1:16,28
is doing.


15
0:1:16,28 --> 0:1:21,87
The Dow is doing well, but the economy is
still struggling. What`s the deal? One possible


16
0:1:21,87 --> 0:1:26,44
explanation is that investors don`t have a
lot of opportunities to make money in other


17
0:1:26,44 --> 0:1:30,69
ways, so the stock market is kind of the best
game in town.


18
0:1:30,69 --> 0:1:33,88
At the start of this week, we reported on
a sink hole that formed underneath a house


19
0:1:33,88 --> 0:1:39,98
in Florida. Workers have finished tearing
down that house and now we can see the actual


20
0:1:39,98 --> 0:1:45,18
hole. That`s it. About 20 feet wide, more
than 50 feet deep. This opened up underneath


21
0:1:45,18 --> 0:1:50,59
a bedroom and swallowed one man up. In that
same report in Monday`s show, we talked about


22
0:1:50,59 --> 0:1:56,77
how and why sink holes show up in Florida.
This one formed on Monday, just three miles


23
0:1:56,77 --> 0:2:2,2
away from the first sink hole. It`s not as
big; 12 feet across, 4-5 feet deep, and it`s


24
0:2:2,2 --> 0:2:5,6
between two houses. So it didn`t cause any
damage.


25
0:2:5,6 --> 0:2:9,289
David Mattingly had the chance to go inside
a sink hole. This is what he found.


26
0:2:9,289 --> 0:2:15,1
DAVID MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A massive
sink hole, carved out of solid limestone by


27
0:2:15,1 --> 0:2:16,49
drops of water.


28
0:2:16,49 --> 0:2:19,39
So this is what a sink hole looks like from
the inside.


29
0:2:19,39 --> 0:2:22,89
JERRY BLACK, GEOLOGIST: From the inside, yes,
before you fill it up with sand and dirt.


30
0:2:22,89 --> 0:2:25,68
MATTINGLY: And if someone were living right
on top of this, they would be at risk?


31
0:2:25,68 --> 0:2:26,12
BLACK: Yes.


32
0:2:26,12 --> 0:2:31,209
MATTINGLY: Geologist Jerry Black says Sunshine
State homeowners might be surprised to find


33
0:2:31,209 --> 0:2:33,3
out just how common these are.


34
0:2:33,3 --> 0:2:38,56
BLACK: Rain water turns to ground water and
that`s what`s naturally acidic. That`s the


35
0:2:38,56 --> 0:2:43,25
device that dissolves the limestone and will
help create these cavities.


36
0:2:43,25 --> 0:2:48,709
MATTINGLY: What is unusual about this sink
hole is it`s easy to get inside. Called "The


37
0:2:48,709 --> 0:2:52,97
Devil`s Den," it`s open to tourists for viewing
and diving.


38
0:2:52,97 --> 0:2:58,1
And dive instructor Prince Johnson takes me
under for a look. I find that this seemingly


39
0:2:58,1 --> 0:3:0,61
placid pool of water is anything but.


40
0:3:0,61 --> 0:3:5,3
PRINCE JOHNSON, DIVE INSTRUCTOR: The water
has gone down considerably because of the


41
0:3:5,3 --> 0:3:9,53
aquifer, but it has also risen. When we`ve
had hurricanes and tropical storms, it has


42
0:3:9,53 --> 0:3:10,19
risen 45 feet.


43
0:3:10,19 --> 0:3:11,9
MATTINGLY: Forty-five fee?


44
0:3:11,9 --> 0:3:12,349
JOHNSON: Forty-five feet.


45
0:3:12,349 --> 0:3:15,48
MATTINGLY: So the water`s constantly going
up and down?


46
0:3:15,48 --> 0:3:16,42
JOHNSON: Up and down.


47
0:3:16,42 --> 0:3:17,849
MATTINGLY: Depending on drought and hurricanes.


48
0:3:17,849 --> 0:3:23,349
Down here, it`s easy to see how fluctuating
groundwater has silently wreaked havoc. I


49
0:3:23,349 --> 0:3:28,84
passed by limestone boulders as big as cars,
sitting on the bottom. And these same forces


50
0:3:28,84 --> 0:3:33,64
are still at work compounded by the demand
for fresh water.


51
0:3:33,64 --> 0:3:39,739
Perhaps most striking to me, how appearances
of this sink hole are so misleading. A single


52
0:3:39,739 --> 0:3:45,79
beam of light reveals the cavern is even bigger
below the waterline, with tunnels and passageways


53
0:3:45,79 --> 0:3:53,9
carved deep into the darkness. But most disturbing
could be the view from up top. The round opening


54
0:3:53,9 --> 0:3:59,65
is deceptively small. Little indication of
the cavern that`s just beneath my feet.


55
0:3:59,65 --> 0:4:3,83
Until a hole like this opens up, there`s really
no warning is there?


56
0:4:3,83 --> 0:4:10,7
BLACK: Correct. It is that random and that
sudden. And it could happen obviously overnight


57
0:4:10,7 --> 0:4:11,95
or any time.


58
0:4:11,95 --> 0:4:18,579
MATTINGLY: It can, and it does. With thousands
of sink holes opening up in Florida every


59
0:4:18,579 --> 0:4:19,629
year.


60
0:4:19,629 --> 0:4:22,71
David Mattingly, CNN, Williston, Florida.


61
0:4:22,71 --> 0:4:29,89
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s shoutout goes
out to Ms. Fuzi`s world history class at St.


62
0:4:29,89 --> 0:4:31,469
Gabriel`s Hall in Audubon, Pennsylvania.


63
0:4:31,469 --> 0:4:38,93
Which of these terms is a synonym for "truce?"
You know what to do. Is it acrimony, coup


64
0:4:38,93 --> 0:4:48,69
d`etat, armistice, or dilettante? You`ve got
three seconds. Go.


65
0:4:48,69 --> 0:4:54,669
Truce and armistice both mean an agreement
that ends some kind of hostilities or fighting.


66
0:4:54,669 --> 0:4:59,15
That`s your answer and that`s your shoutout.


67
0:4:59,15 --> 0:5:5,449
AZUZ: One example, the armistice that was
signed on July 27, 1953 it stopped the war


68
0:5:5,449 --> 0:5:10,4
between North and South Korea. Now, North
Korea is threatening to end that truce.


69
0:5:10,4 --> 0:5:16,18
Here`s the history. The Korean peninsula split
into North and South after World War II. In


70
0:5:16,18 --> 0:5:21,24
June of 1950, the North invaded the South.
That was the start of the Korean War. The


71
0:5:21,24 --> 0:5:26,749
U.S. supported South Korea, China supported
North Korea. Hundreds of thousands of people


72
0:5:26,749 --> 0:5:32,289
died. Here`s the interesting part: the fighting
stopped in 1953 with that armistice. There


73
0:5:32,289 --> 0:5:36,93
was never a peace treaty so the Korean War
technically never ended.


74
0:5:36,93 --> 0:5:40,999
Nowadays, North Korea is a closed society;
it doesn`t have a lot of contact with the


75
0:5:40,999 --> 0:5:46,469
rest of the world. It does have a bad relationship
with some nations including South Korea and


76
0:5:46,469 --> 0:5:50,569
the United States. Some of that has to do
with North Korea`s controversial nuclear program.


77
0:5:50,569 --> 0:5:55,599
The U.S. is leading an international effort
to punish North Korea for a recent nuclear


78
0:5:55,599 --> 0:6:0,83
test it did, and the North says that`s why
it`s threatening to get rid of the 60- year-old


79
0:6:0,83 --> 0:6:0,979
truce.


80
0:6:0,979 --> 0:6:1,46
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


81
0:6:1,46 --> 0:6:7,27
JOHN KERRY, UNITED STATES SECREATRY OF STATE:
North Korea keeps choosing to make belligerent


82
0:6:7,27 --> 0:6:14,449
and reckless moves that threaten the region,
their neighbors, and now directly the United


83
0:6:14,449 --> 0:6:15,319
States of America.


84
0:6:15,319 --> 0:6:15,849
(END VIDEO CLIP)


85
0:6:15,849 --> 0:6:20,77
AZUZ: The border between North and South Korea
is called the DMZ. It stands for the Demilitarized


86
0:6:20,77 --> 0:6:25,599
Zone. It`s a tense place under the best of
circumstances, which is what Paula Hancocks


87
0:6:25,599 --> 0:6:26,99
looked at while she was there.


88
0:6:26,99 --> 0:6:32,24
PAULA HANCOCKS, DEMILITARIZED ZONE: Here in
the DMZ you can see a North Korean soldier


89
0:6:32,24 --> 0:6:37,479
just across the border. They often come out
of that area to see what is happening on this


90
0:6:37,479 --> 0:6:42,749
side, the South Korean border. This is the
joint security area. It`s basically where


91
0:6:42,749 --> 0:6:49,159
all of the negotiations have taken place between
the North and the South since 1953. Now, the


92
0:6:49,159 --> 0:6:54,2
blue huts behind me are half in North Korea,
half in South Korea and the border itself


93
0:6:54,2 --> 0:6:58,979
is obviously very tense. You can see the South
Korean soldiers facing off against the North


94
0:6:58,979 --> 0:7:4,439
Korean soldiers, and a very inauspicious border.
The concrete slab that you can see in the


95
0:7:4,439 --> 0:7:9,52
middle there, just a few inches above the
ground is effectively the border between North


96
0:7:9,52 --> 0:7:10,39
and South Korea.


97
0:7:10,39 --> 0:7:15,729
So here we are in one of the huts in the joint
security area. This is basically where all


98
0:7:15,729 --> 0:7:20,439
of the negotiations take place, half in North
Korea, half in South Korea. Everything has


99
0:7:20,439 --> 0:7:27,2
to be completely equal and you can see at
the moment it`s being monitored by South Korean


100
0:7:27,2 --> 0:7:30,279
soldiers because it`s the South Korean side
that`s letting people in.


101
0:7:30,279 --> 0:7:35,349
This is called checkpoint three along the
DMZ and you can see how close we are to the


102
0:7:35,349 --> 0:7:40,889
demarcation line. These white stakes that
you can see is effectively the border between


103
0:7:40,889 --> 0:7:46,24
North and South Korea. So just beyond that,
beyond those trees you can see a building


104
0:7:46,24 --> 0:7:51,529
there. This is one of the buildings that obviously
the North Koreans could be using to monitor


105
0:7:51,529 --> 0:7:56,21
South Korea just as here on the South Korean
side, they`re monitoring the North Korean


106
0:7:56,21 --> 0:7:57,429
side.


107
0:7:57,429 --> 0:8:5,809
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can ID me.
I`m an endangered species that`s been around


108
0:8:5,809 --> 0:8:11,669
for millions of years. My hundreds of teeth
come in handy since I`m the largest predatory


109
0:8:11,669 --> 0:8:20,159
fish on the planet. Despite my name, the only
part of my body is my underbelly.


110
0:8:20,159 --> 0:8:28,909
I`m a great white shark and I can move through
the water at up to 15 miles per hour.


111
0:8:28,909 --> 0:8:34,58
AZUZ: One scientist said that finding a great
white is like looking for a needle in a haystack.


112
0:8:34,58 --> 0:8:39,159
Researchers got their hands on one recently.
They found it about 200 yards off the Florida


113
0:8:39,159 --> 0:8:44,279
coast. Researchers tried to haul her into
this at first, but then realized they`re going


114
0:8:44,279 --> 0:8:48,23
to need a bigger boat. Once they landed her,
the scientists had 15 minutes to do about


115
0:8:48,23 --> 0:8:52,48
a dozen things. They checked to see if she
was pregnant, collected blood samples, and


116
0:8:52,48 --> 0:8:56,14
tagged her with a satellite transmitter to
track her movements. They`re hoping to learn


117
0:8:56,14 --> 0:9:0,82
more about these sharks and to increase public
safety. If a tagged great white gets too close


118
0:9:0,82 --> 0:9:5,17
to shore, the scientists will call authorities
who can warn people on the beach.


119
0:9:5,17 --> 0:9:10,35
San Francisco`s Bay Bridge doesn`t get as
much attention as the Golden Gate. Then someone


120
0:9:10,35 --> 0:9:15,97
came up with this bright idea: it`s a combination
of art and technology. Twenty-five thousand


121
0:9:15,97 --> 0:9:21,83
lights spread out across the nearly two mile
bridge. If it looks like they`re shifting,


122
0:9:21,83 --> 0:9:26,95
they are. The artist set up a program that
lets him control each light individually.


123
0:9:26,95 --> 0:9:31,26
He can run the whole thing from his laptop.
The lights will be on every night for two


124
0:9:31,26 --> 0:9:35,14
years. If the artist has something else planned
for then, then this display is just bridging


125
0:9:35,14 --> 0:9:39,97
the gap. At any rate, the Bay Bridge won`t
be in the Golden Gate`s shadow for a while.


126
0:9:39,97 --> 0:9:43,85
This story`s not funny, the puns aren`t that
great, but it makes sense as a before we go


127
0:9:43,85 --> 0:9:46,13
segment we try to focus on the lighter side
of things.


128
0:9:46,13 --> 0:11:46,13
It`s lights out for now, we`re back tomorrow
for more CNN STUDENT NEWS.
