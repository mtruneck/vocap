0:0:1,44 --> 0:0:1,92
Hey guys!


3
0:0:1,92 --> 0:0:3,1
I'm Elliott from VICE.


4
0:0:3,1 --> 0:0:5,47
We're here with our friends at
MINI, getting ready to embark


5
0:0:5,47 --> 0:0:7,435
on an adventure of an entirely
different sort.


6
0:0:7,435 --> 0:0:11,524



7
0:0:11,524 --> 0:0:14,65
You see, we scoured the globe in
search of stories that have


8
0:0:14,65 --> 0:0:16,59
to be seen to be believed.


9
0:0:16,59 --> 0:0:18,88
Now we're going to drive over
and check them out.


10
0:0:18,88 --> 0:0:21,13
Now when I say "we," I mean
me and a trusty co-pilot.


11
0:0:21,13 --> 0:0:27,215



12
0:0:27,215 --> 0:0:29,9
If you want to see a truck that
looks like Optimus Prime


13
0:0:29,9 --> 0:0:32,6
on acid, indigenous dancers with
hooks in their faces, a


14
0:0:32,6 --> 0:0:35,4
music scene that's centered
around taxi drivers, we're


15
0:0:35,4 --> 0:0:37,61
going to "All the Wrong
Places." So join us!


16
0:0:37,61 --> 0:2:37,61
