CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: It`s Thursday, February
28th. And it`s Pope Benedict XVI last day


2
0:0:18,78 --> 0:0:23,38
as pope. He announced his resignation earlier
this month, and his time as pope officially


3
0:0:23,38 --> 0:0:24,98
ends this evening.


4
0:0:24,98 --> 0:0:29,27
The pope is the head of the Roman Catholic
Church. Christianity is the world`s largest


5
0:0:29,27 --> 0:0:34,309
religion, and Catholics are the largest groups
of Christians. There are around 1.2 billion


6
0:0:34,309 --> 0:0:39,66
Catholics around the world. Yesterday, Pope
Benedict made his final public speech in St.


7
0:0:39,66 --> 0:0:44,7
Peter`s Square. That`s part of Vatican City,
the headquarters of the Catholic Church, and


8
0:0:44,7 --> 0:0:46,3
the world`s smallest country.


9
0:0:46,3 --> 0:0:50,35
In yesterday`s speech, the pope talked about
his spiritual journey during his nearly eight


10
0:0:50,35 --> 0:0:54,57
years as head of the church. There have been
controversies and scandals surrounding the


11
0:0:54,57 --> 0:1:0,399
Catholic Church, like accusations of some
priests abusing children and claims of corruption.


12
0:1:0,399 --> 0:1:3,68
Some analysts think the pope was referring
to these issues during his speech.

CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: He
spoke about how he had so much joy, he said,


15
0:1:7,38 --> 0:1:12,44
in the church, in his eight years of reign,
but he also talked about how - that it`d been


16
0:1:12,44 --> 0:1:17,289
difficult times, he said, it had been far
from easy on occasion. He talked about how


17
0:1:17,289 --> 0:1:24,479
the church had come across "agitated waters",
and then sometimes found itself facing the


18
0:1:24,479 --> 0:1:25,83
different directions of the wind.

0:1:25,83 --> 0:1:26,61

20
0:1:26,61 --> 0:1:32,45
AZUZ: Pope Benedict is the first pope in nearly
600 years to resign. What comes next? He`ll


21
0:1:32,45 --> 0:1:36,819
still be called Benedict, the name he chose
when he became pope, and he`ll still be referred


22
0:1:36,819 --> 0:1:42,349
to as "His Holiness." But his official title
will be Pope Emeritus. He`ll live in Vatican


23
0:1:42,349 --> 0:1:47,31
City in a small monastery. And Benedict is
expected to devote his time to prayer and


24
0:1:47,31 --> 0:1:51,88
study. As for the Roman Catholic Church, it
has to elect a new pope and here`s how that


25
0:1:51,88 --> 0:1:52,599
process happens.

27
0:1:52,84 --> 0:1:56,2
JOHN ALLEN, CNN SENIOR VATICAN ANALYST: The
pope is the spiritual leader of 1.2 billion


28
0:1:56,2 --> 0:2:5,6
Catholics around the world, and the most visible
religious leader of any kind on the planet.


29
0:2:5,6 --> 0:2:9,52
The new pope is always chosen by the members
of the college of cardinals. They are the


30
0:2:9,52 --> 0:2:14,64
highest office in the church under the pope
himself. Normally, when a papacy ends either


31
0:2:14,64 --> 0:2:19,569
through death or resignation, cardinals from
around the world gather in Rome, they have


32
0:2:19,569 --> 0:2:24,37
daily meetings to talk about the issues facing
the church and the qualities the new pope


33
0:2:24,37 --> 0:2:29,9
needs. We are talking about slightly over
100 cardinals who file into the Sistine Chapel


34
0:2:29,9 --> 0:2:34,79
cast ballots and pick a pope.


35
0:2:34,79 --> 0:2:38,849
Conclave is a term that comes from two Latin
words, meaning with a key. It refers to the


36
0:2:38,849 --> 0:2:43,48
fact that the cardinals are locked behind
closed doors while they go through a highly


37
0:2:43,48 --> 0:2:49,79
ceremonial process of casting ballots and
then burning them. Then it goes as long as


38
0:2:49,79 --> 0:2:53,29
it takes for somebody to get two thirds - the
shortest conclave in history took a couple


39
0:2:53,29 --> 0:2:56,719
of hours. The longest one took three years.


40
0:2:56,719 --> 0:3:3,73
In the old days, they would burn ballots largely
because they wanted to maintain the secrecy


41
0:3:3,73 --> 0:3:8,689
of the conclave, that is they didn`t want
the vote totals to get out. What they realized,


42
0:3:8,689 --> 0:3:12,89
is that when people saw the smoke from the
chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, they knew


43
0:3:12,89 --> 0:3:18,3
a round of balloting had ended, and so they
came up with the system where they would put


44
0:3:18,3 --> 0:3:23,56
chemicals into the mix to turn the smoke black
if no pope had been elected, and white, if


45
0:3:23,56 --> 0:3:27,609
a pope had been elected.


46
0:3:27,609 --> 0:3:33,59
In theory, according to the law of the church,
any person who was eligible for ordination


47
0:3:33,59 --> 0:3:40,69
to the priesthood and therefore, an unmarried
male, could be elected as pope. But in practice,


48
0:3:40,69 --> 0:3:44,62
the new pope will be elected from among the
cardinals who are voting. That is the cardinals


49
0:3:44,62 --> 0:3:49,519
who are under the age of 80, who will take
part in this election. Which means that the


50
0:3:49,519 --> 0:3:58,239
roughly 150 cardinals aren`t merely voters,
they are all also candidates.


51
0:3:58,239 --> 0:4:3,849
When a candidate crosses that two thirds threshold,
another cardinal will approach him and say,


52
0:4:3,849 --> 0:4:10,69
do you accept your canonically valid election
as Supreme Pontiff? If he answers yes, from


53
0:4:10,69 --> 0:4:15,51
that moment forward, he becomes the pope.
The next questions is, by what name will you


54
0:4:15,51 --> 0:4:20,739
be known? And at that stage, the new pope
tells his brother cardinals what he wants


55
0:4:20,739 --> 0:4:26,61
to be called. And in a few minutes later,
when the announcement is made from a balcony


56
0:4:26,61 --> 0:4:31,36
outside St. Peter`s Square, the whole world
will know the name of the new pope.

0:4:34,36 --> 0:4:39,41
AZUZ: The deadline is tomorrow for President
Obama and Congress to come up with the deal


59
0:4:39,41 --> 0:4:44,21
to lower the country`s debt. Otherwise, some
forced spending cuts are automatically going


60
0:4:44,21 --> 0:4:50,56
to kick in. We are talking about $85 billion
immediately, $1.2 trillion total over the


61
0:4:50,56 --> 0:4:54,169
next ten years. Tomorrow, we are going to
look at where some of those cuts could happen.


62
0:4:54,169 --> 0:4:56,96
Today, we are looking at how we got here.


63
0:4:56,96 --> 0:5:0,58
Every year the president is required to come
up with a budget proposal. He submits that


64
0:5:0,58 --> 0:5:5,91
to Congress. Then Congress comes up with the
final budget. Right now, the U.S. government


65
0:5:5,91 --> 0:5:11,38
spends more than it makes. A lot more. That`s
why we have a massive debt. Back in 2011,


66
0:5:11,38 --> 0:5:15,599
during a standoff over the debt, the president
and Congress came up with the plan. They set


67
0:5:15,599 --> 0:5:20,99
up the possibility of automatic spending cuts,
but only if lawmakers couldn`t agree on other


68
0:5:20,99 --> 0:5:26,19
ways to reduce the debt. The idea was that
the automatic cuts would be so drastic, that


69
0:5:26,19 --> 0:5:30,77
there was no way anyone was going to let them
happen. Throughout 2012, political leaders


70
0:5:30,77 --> 0:5:36,129
never agreed on an alternative. The cuts were
supposed to happen on January 1st of this


71
0:5:36,129 --> 0:5:40,31
year. They got pushed back two months, and
that leaves us where we are now.

0:5:48,55 --> 0:5:53,74
Who was known as the mother of the U.S. civil
rights movement? Is it Harriet Tubman, Coretta


76
0:5:53,74 --> 0:6:4,379
Scott King, Rosa Parks or Susan B. Anthony?
You`ve got three seconds, go!


77
0:6:4,379 --> 0:6:9,44
Rosa Parks is referred to as the mother of
the civil rights movement. Partly because


78
0:6:9,44 --> 0:6:16,449
of her actions on December 1st 1955. That`s
your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."

80
0:6:18,61 --> 0:6:23,259
AZUZ: On that day, Rosa Parks was arrested
for refusing to give up her bus seat to a


81
0:6:23,259 --> 0:6:28,47
white passenger. The ensuing bus boycott is
considered the official start of the civil


82
0:6:28,47 --> 0:6:33,93
rights movement. Parks passed away in 2005.
She`s gotten numerous honors and tributes


83
0:6:33,93 --> 0:6:38,629
for her work for equal rights. The U.S. Postal
Service released a stamp this year, honoring


84
0:6:38,629 --> 0:6:43,61
Parks. And yesterday, President Obama and
congressional leaders unveiled a bronze statue


85
0:6:43,61 --> 0:6:47,889
of Rosa Parks at the U.S. Capitol. She`s the
first African- American woman to be honored


86
0:6:47,889 --> 0:6:48,46
in this way.

Next story today comes from Emily Longnecker,
a reporter with affiliate WTHR. It reminds


94
0:7:11,3 --> 0:7:16,629
me of this great quote from Thomas Edison:
opportunity is missed by most people, because


95
0:7:16,629 --> 0:7:19,39
it`s dressed in overalls and looks like work.


96
0:7:19,39 --> 0:7:23,139
For a young man in Indiana, finding work was
all that mattered. While he was on the way


97
0:7:23,139 --> 0:7:27,129
to interview for one job, he landed another
almost by accident.

JHAQUIEL REAGAN, HIRED AT RESTAURANT: I`m
out there, you know, every day, trying to

0:7:34,12 --> 0:7:34,12
make a dollar.


101
0:7:34,12 --> 0:7:36,24
EMILY LONGNECKER: Friday morning, though,
18-year old Jhaqiel Reagan was unemployed


102
0:7:36,24 --> 0:7:36,819
and broke.


103
0:7:36,819 --> 0:7:38,879
REAGAN: I`m staying anywhere I can.


104
0:7:38,879 --> 0:7:42,289
LONGNECKER: But a walk through this restaurant`s
parking lot turned out to be the proverbial


105
0:7:42,289 --> 0:7:44,9
fork in what`s been a long road for this young
man.


106
0:7:44,9 --> 0:7:49,39
ART BOUVIER, OWNER, PAPA ROUX: He just says
excuse me, can you tell me how far it is to


107
0:7:49,39 --> 0:7:49,87
the hotel (ph) Sherman.


108
0:7:49,87 --> 0:7:53,759
LONGNECKER: The owner of Papa Roux, Art Bouvier,
was out clearing ice and snow from the parking


109
0:7:53,759 --> 0:7:53,96
lot.


110
0:7:53,96 --> 0:7:58,49
BOUVIER: I said, buddy, that`s about six or
seven miles to Sherman, and I fully expected


111
0:7:58,49 --> 0:8:3,479
the next question was, can you give some money
for the bus? And it wasn`t. He just kept walking.


112
0:8:3,479 --> 0:8:7,139
LONGNECKER: 20 minutes later, Art was driving
down 10th street, Jhaqiel and offered him


113
0:8:7,139 --> 0:8:7,139
a ride.


114
0:8:7,139 --> 0:8:8,699
REAGAN: I was really appreciative.


115
0:8:8,699 --> 0:8:12,52
LONGNECKER: What Art heard next, though, convinced
him. This meeting was no accident.


116
0:8:12,52 --> 0:8:17,979
BOUVIER: It was destiny. He said, I have an
interview at a thrift store. I said - interview


117
0:8:17,979 --> 0:8:23,639
at a thrift store. You`re walking ten miles
in the ice and snow to an interview at a thrift


118
0:8:23,639 --> 0:8:24,2
store.

0:8:24,2 --> 0:8:25,189
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Shrimp!


120
0:8:25,189 --> 0:8:30,9
BOUVIER: And I just got the thinking, that`s
- that`s a good work ethic.


121
0:8:30,9 --> 0:8:35,0
LONGNECKER: So, Art took Jhaqiel`s number
just in case. Just in case came hours later.


122
0:8:35,0 --> 0:8:38,789
BOUVIER: I want to show you the ropes tonight,
if you want, we`re a little busy in there.


123
0:8:38,789 --> 0:8:40,45
REAGAN: OK, that`s fun. That`s real (ph).


124
0:8:40,45 --> 0:8:44,66
LONGNECKER: Art was so impressed by Jhaqiel,
he posted the story of their chance meeting


125
0:8:44,66 --> 0:8:50,15
on Facebook. Now, he has regular customers
offering to buy Jhaqiel a bus pass so he can


126
0:8:50,15 --> 0:8:51,42
get here, to his new job.


127
0:8:51,42 --> 0:8:54,72
REAGAN: I don`t know. I get my work ethics
from my dad. You know, he`s worked his fingers


128
0:8:54,72 --> 0:8:55,69
to the bone all his life.


129
0:8:55,69 --> 0:8:59,67
LONGNECKER: Like father, like son. Jhaqiel
is willing to do the same. And now has the


130

chance to do it.

Well, sometimes our "Before We Go " segment

are back at a local news station, the one


142
0:9:28,36 --> 0:9:33,32
in pink didn`t quite make it all the way down,
but it gave her a head start to the finish.


143
0:9:33,32 --> 0:9:38,11
Who knew a simian could be such a cheater?
The point of all this, was to promote a professional


144
0:9:38,11 --> 0:9:42,78
bull riding event that features these guys.
I guess the monkeys just wanted to horn in


145
0:9:42,78 --> 0:9:46,67
on the event and to steer all the attention
back to themselves. Or maybe they were just


146
0:9:46,67 --> 0:9:51,29
monkeying around. Other way, I`m sure, people
went bananas over that performance. Sad, isn`t


147
0:9:51,29 --> 0:11:51,29
it? It`s time for us to split. We`ll see you
tomorrow.
