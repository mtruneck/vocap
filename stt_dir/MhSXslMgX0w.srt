[MUSIC - OH SNAP!, "BILL
COSBY SWEATER"]


3
0:0:7,91 --> 0:0:32,163



4
0:0:32,163 --> 0:0:35,67
KOOS VAN DEN AKKER: My name is
Koos Van Den Akker, which is a


5
0:0:35,67 --> 0:0:36,4
Dutch name.


6
0:0:36,4 --> 0:0:38,3
I'm from Holland.


7
0:0:38,3 --> 0:0:39,4
I was in Paris first.


8
0:0:39,4 --> 0:0:42,23
I learned my trade at Christian


9
0:0:42,23 --> 0:0:46,56
Dior, 1960 'til 1965.


10
0:0:46,56 --> 0:0:49,8
Then I went back to Holland and
had my own store in the


11
0:0:49,8 --> 0:0:51,49
Hague where I was born.


12
0:0:51,49 --> 0:0:53,9
But you know the Dutch--


13
0:0:53,9 --> 0:0:55,8
Holland was not set up for
fashion, it was totally


14
0:0:55,8 --> 0:0:56,52
ridiculous.


15
0:0:56,52 --> 0:1:0,49
I mean, I came with all those
Dior fantasies and all those


16
0:1:0,49 --> 0:1:3,64
women that were like
cows there.


17
0:1:3,64 --> 0:1:7,46
All they wanted was a skirt with
extra pieces in front of


18
0:1:7,46 --> 0:1:10,125
skirts so that the knees
wouldn't wear out too fast.


19
0:1:10,125 --> 0:1:11,64
You know, that kind of stuff.


20
0:1:11,64 --> 0:1:13,35
This was 1960.


21
0:1:13,35 --> 0:1:17,14
And so I always wanted to come
to this country ever since I


22
0:1:17,14 --> 0:1:20,38
saw "Breakfast at Tiffany's."
I've been in this country


23
0:1:20,38 --> 0:1:26,33
since 1968 and made a career
here, 40 years, and never


24
0:1:26,33 --> 0:1:27,58
looked back.


25
0:1:27,58 --> 0:1:29,61



26
0:1:29,61 --> 0:1:34,19
This is my work room and this
is the people I work with.


27
0:1:34,19 --> 0:1:35,69
Beatrice is here.


28
0:1:35,69 --> 0:1:40,36
Beatrice has been with
me for 28 years.


29
0:1:40,36 --> 0:1:43,39
28, 29, yeah?


30
0:1:43,39 --> 0:1:44,235
BEATRICE: [INAUDIBLE]


31
0:1:44,235 --> 0:1:44,7
29.


32
0:1:44,7 --> 0:1:46,82
KOOS VAN DEN AKKER:
Amazing, huh?


33
0:1:46,82 --> 0:1:49,584
This is Javier.


34
0:1:49,584 --> 0:1:52,32
And Javier works with
the customers.


35
0:1:52,32 --> 0:1:56,47
So when there is stuff to be
done in the store for those


36
0:1:56,47 --> 0:1:59,38
women, Javier is the one
that likes to do that.


37
0:1:59,38 --> 0:2:1,306
So he fusses with those women.


38
0:2:1,306 --> 0:2:2,0
JAVIER: Fuss.


39
0:2:2,0 --> 0:2:3,31
KOOS VAN DEN AKKER: And
is good with it, too.


40
0:2:3,31 --> 0:2:7,38



41
0:2:7,38 --> 0:2:11,33
Part of my legacy in this
business is making the Bill


42
0:2:11,33 --> 0:2:13,76
Cosby sweater.


43
0:2:13,76 --> 0:2:16,53
The ones that I made for Bill
Cosby and the ones that I made


44
0:2:16,53 --> 0:2:19,73
in that period were all
one-of-a-kind sweaters.


45
0:2:19,73 --> 0:2:22,34
See, this is a typical
Cosby sweater.


46
0:2:22,34 --> 0:2:27,2
So the base is a jersey,
so it's stretchy.


47
0:2:27,2 --> 0:2:32,1
And then usually I use woolens
and jerseys together and make


48
0:2:32,1 --> 0:2:34,3
this kind of arrangement.


49
0:2:34,3 --> 0:2:38,38
And in those days in the
early '80s, it was


50
0:2:38,38 --> 0:2:41,19
very much of patterns.


51
0:2:41,19 --> 0:2:45,63
Now you have to realize, when
you look at this now it's


52
0:2:45,63 --> 0:2:48,57
familiar because all the fashion
today is like that.


53
0:2:48,57 --> 0:2:53,12
When I did this there was
nothing like that around, so


54
0:2:53,12 --> 0:2:54,57
people were just freaked out.


55
0:2:54,57 --> 0:2:56,7
They said what the
fuck is that?


56
0:2:56,7 --> 0:2:58,1
MALE SPEAKER: Are these
sweaters that


57
0:2:58,1 --> 0:2:59,1
he wore on the show?


58
0:2:59,1 --> 0:3:1,111
KOOS VAN DEN AKKER: Those were
the Cosby sweaters, yeah, that


59
0:3:1,111 --> 0:3:4,67
I got back for this occasion.


60
0:3:4,67 --> 0:3:9,98
This is a very thin line between
absolutely awful and


61
0:3:9,98 --> 0:3:11,45
something of genius.


62
0:3:11,45 --> 0:3:13,15
I mean, somebody can
look at it and say


63
0:3:13,15 --> 0:3:14,19
what the fuck is this?


64
0:3:14,19 --> 0:3:16,78
This is the most horrible
thing I've ever seen.


65
0:3:16,78 --> 0:3:22,84
And somebody else says
it's inspiration.


66
0:3:22,84 --> 0:3:27,58
All this collaging, all this
graphic stuff that I do,


67
0:3:27,58 --> 0:3:32,58
painting with fabrics, was
exceptional here but in


68
0:3:32,58 --> 0:3:34,12
Holland it was everywhere.


69
0:3:34,12 --> 0:3:36,58
So I was really the guy.


70
0:3:36,58 --> 0:3:39,13
I was totally original.


71
0:3:39,13 --> 0:3:42,4
When I did it then, people
really couldn't figure out was


72
0:3:42,4 --> 0:3:44,77
this home sewing or
was this genius?


73
0:3:44,77 --> 0:3:47,1
And they didn't go for
genius, believe me.


74
0:3:47,1 --> 0:3:48,35
They went for home sewing.


75
0:3:48,35 --> 0:3:56,78



76
0:3:56,78 --> 0:4:0,1
I had a friend, a black actress


77
0:4:0,1 --> 0:4:1,58
called Josephine Premice.


78
0:4:1,58 --> 0:4:4,36
And she was a good customer
and she was a


79
0:4:4,36 --> 0:4:5,47
friend of Bill Cosby.


80
0:4:5,47 --> 0:4:8,64
And so one day she came to me
and she said listen, I have to


81
0:4:8,64 --> 0:4:9,97
have a present for Bill.


82
0:4:9,97 --> 0:4:12,365
Would you make him a sweater
or something?


83
0:4:12,365 --> 0:4:13,32
And I said sure.


84
0:4:13,32 --> 0:4:17,29
And so she went to see him and
gave him the sweater and he


85
0:4:17,29 --> 0:4:18,61
liked it very much.


86
0:4:18,61 --> 0:4:23,0
So he went on the set
with the sweater on.


87
0:4:23,0 --> 0:4:27,14
Well, that episode got so many
letters, apparently, asking


88
0:4:27,14 --> 0:4:28,72
where did he get this sweater?


89
0:4:28,72 --> 0:4:31,21
What the hell was that?


90
0:4:31,21 --> 0:4:34,74
That he called and he said
listen, this is a big success.


91
0:4:34,74 --> 0:4:35,74
Would you make me more?


92
0:4:35,74 --> 0:4:38,89
And I said absolutely,
sure, why not.


93
0:4:38,89 --> 0:4:39,66
And so that was it.


94
0:4:39,66 --> 0:4:42,63
And all of a sudden there they
were on TV, and it was a kick


95
0:4:42,63 --> 0:4:43,86
and it was totally fun.


96
0:4:43,86 --> 0:4:45,58
And then I got to know
him, of course.


97
0:4:45,58 --> 0:4:50,98
And Bill Cosby was just a
delightful man who very much


98
0:4:50,98 --> 0:4:56,37
appreciated my work and
the way I worked,


99
0:4:56,37 --> 0:4:57,56
and supported it.


100
0:4:57,56 --> 0:5:0,97
And that's basically the
story and I was very


101
0:5:0,97 --> 0:5:1,85
thankful for that.


102
0:5:1,85 --> 0:5:5,48
You know, fabrics is never
important to me what it costs.


103
0:5:5,48 --> 0:5:10,82
I can work with $2 a yard
fabric, I can work with $50 a


104
0:5:10,82 --> 0:5:11,63
yard fabric.


105
0:5:11,63 --> 0:5:13,8
I prefer the $2 a yard fabric.


106
0:5:13,8 --> 0:5:15,59
Here, this is my table
and it's an


107
0:5:15,59 --> 0:5:17,22
enormous mess right now.


108
0:5:17,22 --> 0:5:21,64
So this is a paper pattern
of a skirt.


109
0:5:21,64 --> 0:5:26,57
I pick a primary fabric,
which will be this one.


110
0:5:26,57 --> 0:5:31,33
And so I will cut a
skirt out of that.


111
0:5:31,33 --> 0:5:38,4
And then when I have that flat,
then I think well, what


112
0:5:38,4 --> 0:5:40,96
would work with this?


113
0:5:40,96 --> 0:5:42,1
Nothing is by chance--


114
0:5:42,1 --> 0:5:46,46
you compose it.


115
0:5:46,46 --> 0:5:51,9
There is no reason why this is
here and not there, of course.


116
0:5:51,9 --> 0:5:54,88
To my eye, this looks good.


117
0:5:54,88 --> 0:5:58,5
And so then you press it down,
you pin it down, and then you


118
0:5:58,5 --> 0:6:0,12
make the whole thing.


119
0:6:0,12 --> 0:6:2,34
And that's basically
the process of it.


120
0:6:2,34 --> 0:6:5,4
It's painting with fabrics.


121
0:6:5,4 --> 0:6:8,86
It's making pictures one after
another and just happen to be


122
0:6:8,86 --> 0:6:10,67
clothes, and that's it.


123
0:6:10,67 --> 0:6:13,25
I never cared about
was it washable?


124
0:6:13,25 --> 0:6:14,19
Can you clean it?


125
0:6:14,19 --> 0:6:16,8
I couldn't care less.


126
0:6:16,8 --> 0:6:18,43
Never was a problem with me--


127
0:6:18,43 --> 0:6:20,82
no, didn't care.


128
0:6:20,82 --> 0:6:24,43
I have a new thing now with
the ribbons that look like


129
0:6:24,43 --> 0:6:27,49
Arabic writing, and I think
it's very beautiful.


130
0:6:27,49 --> 0:6:30,68
And it looks like, again, those
countries where we have


131
0:6:30,68 --> 0:6:35,74
trouble with where everything
is beautiful, really.


132
0:6:35,74 --> 0:6:38,55
There's nothing more beautiful
than that.


133
0:6:38,55 --> 0:6:41,2
Here is a man who is totally
comfortable in his


134
0:6:41,2 --> 0:6:42,6
clothes, in his skin.


135
0:6:42,6 --> 0:6:46,75
A practical and how absolutely
beautiful.


136
0:6:46,75 --> 0:6:51,67
But everything in this book is
things I wish I could put it


137
0:6:51,67 --> 0:6:53,32
together as beautiful.


138
0:6:53,32 --> 0:6:58,82
Look, everything is with great
dignity, beautiful,


139
0:6:58,82 --> 0:7:0,66
beautiful--


140
0:7:0,66 --> 0:7:6,45
this to me is fashion, this
is my inspiration.


141
0:7:6,45 --> 0:7:9,32
When you talk about collaging,
this is collage.


142
0:7:9,32 --> 0:7:13,1
This is totally beauty,
this is pure beauty.


143
0:7:13,1 --> 0:7:16,91
That is just the best.


144
0:7:16,91 --> 0:7:20,92
I did a master class in San
Francisco at the Academy of


145
0:7:20,92 --> 0:7:22,33
Art College.


146
0:7:22,33 --> 0:7:25,22
And all those kids looked
so hot with all the


147
0:7:25,22 --> 0:7:26,52
tattoos and all that.


148
0:7:26,52 --> 0:7:28,94
And so one day I thought well,
if I don't do it now I'll


149
0:7:28,94 --> 0:7:29,93
never do it.


150
0:7:29,93 --> 0:7:31,57
I called a friend, and
I said listen, I


151
0:7:31,57 --> 0:7:33,8
want a tattoo by tonight.


152
0:7:33,8 --> 0:7:36,65
So we went to the Chinatown
and he talked to some old


153
0:7:36,65 --> 0:7:37,9
Chinese gentleman.


154
0:7:37,9 --> 0:7:40,3



155
0:7:40,3 --> 0:7:43,3
I wanted it to say "new
beginnings," so he asked the


156
0:7:43,3 --> 0:7:46,19
old man to write down new
beginnings in Chinese and he


157
0:7:46,19 --> 0:7:47,48
wrote it down.


158
0:7:47,48 --> 0:7:52,42
Then with the piece of paper,
we went to a tattoo parlor.


159
0:7:52,42 --> 0:7:55,99
And I said I want it to look
like a piece of fabric, like a


160
0:7:55,99 --> 0:7:59,23
swatch with polka dots,
and I want that on it.


161
0:7:59,23 --> 0:8:2,1
And, of course, needless to say,
the next day when I got


162
0:8:2,1 --> 0:8:4,7
to school I was the guy.


163
0:8:4,7 --> 0:8:5,46
I was the man.


164
0:8:5,46 --> 0:8:10,3
I was totally like oh,
shit, this is cool.


165
0:8:10,3 --> 0:8:14,27
And of course it was, I mean,
70-year-old man who all of a


166
0:8:14,27 --> 0:8:15,42
sudden has a tattoo?


167
0:8:15,42 --> 0:8:17,1
It's nice.


168
0:8:17,1 --> 0:8:20,87
In San Francisco I had a big
classroom that was mine.


169
0:8:20,87 --> 0:8:24,48
So I photographed the walls
here as they are.


170
0:8:24,48 --> 0:8:27,41
And the photo department in
that school-- it's a very


171
0:8:27,41 --> 0:8:28,49
fancy school--


172
0:8:28,49 --> 0:8:32,11
had it all done exactly
the same size as the


173
0:8:32,11 --> 0:8:33,49
walls in the school.


174
0:8:33,49 --> 0:8:37,9
So my area in the school was
exactly like this, except


175
0:8:37,9 --> 0:8:38,52
everything was photos.


176
0:8:38,52 --> 0:8:40,98
This was all photos, you
couldn't take these glasses,


177
0:8:40,98 --> 0:8:43,9
it was all photo.


178
0:8:43,9 --> 0:8:46,25
And then there where all the
other tables where the kids


179
0:8:46,25 --> 0:8:48,24
were working and eight machines
where they were


180
0:8:48,24 --> 0:8:49,1
working on.


181
0:8:49,1 --> 0:8:50,58
So I was in my own workroom.


182
0:8:50,58 --> 0:8:54,47
It's still there, because I go
back there in July and I go


183
0:8:54,47 --> 0:8:56,28
back to my room.


184
0:8:56,28 --> 0:8:59,36
Fashion and the fashion world,
I couldn't care less.


185
0:8:59,36 --> 0:9:2,82
It's so overrated and
silly and all that.


186
0:9:2,82 --> 0:9:4,76
It's not my life-- never was.


187
0:9:4,76 --> 0:9:7,17
I like to put fabrics
together.


188
0:9:7,17 --> 0:9:9,59
So if I could make pillows
for the rest of my


189
0:9:9,59 --> 0:9:11,0
life I probably would.


190
0:9:11,0 --> 0:9:12,89
I love sewing, you know?


191
0:9:12,89 --> 0:9:15,99
I don't consider myself
a designer and all


192
0:9:15,99 --> 0:9:17,29
that shit, I'm not.


193
0:9:17,29 --> 0:9:23,5
If I had become famous by doing
couches and walls, I


194
0:9:23,5 --> 0:9:24,17
would have never made a dress.


195
0:9:24,17 --> 0:9:25,15
I don't like women.


196
0:9:25,15 --> 0:9:26,7
I don't like working
with them.


197
0:9:26,7 --> 0:9:29,12
I don't fuss with women
at all, that's why I'm


198
0:9:29,12 --> 0:9:31,21
never in the store.


199
0:9:31,21 --> 0:9:35,26
They need more psychiatrists
than they need a designer.


200
0:9:35,26 --> 0:9:39,691
That doesn't help when
you need PR.


201
0:9:39,691 --> 0:9:44,18
You say you don't really like
women, well hey, then you're


202
0:9:44,18 --> 0:9:45,43
not in the right corner.


203
0:9:45,43 --> 0:10:4,71



204
0:10:4,71 --> 0:10:9,14
This is a great guy in San
Francisco called Bullwinkle


205
0:10:9,14 --> 0:10:11,9
and we exchange clothes
for artworks.


206
0:10:11,9 --> 0:10:19,92
This is me in 1981, and then
this is me two years ago.


207
0:10:19,92 --> 0:10:24,11
That happened to be a nice
photo, but the contrast is


208
0:10:24,11 --> 0:10:25,35
pretty shocking.


209
0:10:25,35 --> 0:10:29,62
This one's nice-- that was in
a show in Houston, Texas.


210
0:10:29,62 --> 0:10:33,38
I had done the screen and
I was probably about


211
0:10:33,38 --> 0:10:35,55
45-years-old there.


212
0:10:35,55 --> 0:10:38,374
Those were dear friends
of mine who died.


213
0:10:38,374 --> 0:10:39,99
They all died.


214
0:10:39,99 --> 0:10:44,66
So many people that are
gone, but that's just


215
0:10:44,66 --> 0:10:45,805
part of life, right?


216
0:10:45,805 --> 0:10:47,9
Those were my cats.


217
0:10:47,9 --> 0:10:50,4
And I had two, this
one and that one.


218
0:10:50,4 --> 0:10:53,41
And they became very old and
they died on the top of


219
0:10:53,41 --> 0:10:54,7
fabrics and all that.


220
0:10:54,7 --> 0:10:56,52
I just called, the doctor
came here, gave


221
0:10:56,52 --> 0:10:57,76
them a little thing.


222
0:10:57,76 --> 0:11:4,7
And the nice thing is that he
died on a piece of brocade.


223
0:11:4,7 --> 0:11:6,94
He didn't even know, he never
even opened his eyes.


224
0:11:6,94 --> 0:11:9,25
He got a shot and that
was the end of that.


225
0:11:9,25 --> 0:11:11,2
And they took him away and
I made a beautiful


226
0:11:11,2 --> 0:11:12,6
jacket out of it.


227
0:11:12,6 --> 0:11:14,82
And the woman that wore that
jacket never knew that some


228
0:11:14,82 --> 0:11:16,53
cat had died right
on top of it.


229
0:11:16,53 --> 0:11:27,61



230
0:11:27,61 --> 0:11:30,8
It's horrible to look at
yourself in the mirror and see


231
0:11:30,8 --> 0:11:32,55
this old guy.


232
0:11:32,55 --> 0:11:34,83
Inside I'm nothing
older than you.


233
0:11:34,83 --> 0:11:35,8
How old are you?


234
0:11:35,8 --> 0:11:36,66
MALE SPEAKER: I'm 29.


235
0:11:36,66 --> 0:11:38,1
KOOS VAN DEN AKKER:
Yeah, nice.


236
0:11:38,1 --> 0:11:41,62
I'm nothing older than that,
and then yet, I am.


237
0:11:41,62 --> 0:11:43,94
I used to wear my own clothes
when I was younger.


238
0:11:43,94 --> 0:11:48,6
Now it doesn't really
matter anymore.


239
0:11:48,6 --> 0:11:53,52
I'm comfortable in just
what I wear now.


240
0:11:53,52 --> 0:11:57,47
Yeah, it's a rich life,
it's a rich career.


241
0:11:57,47 --> 0:12:0,67
If I drop dead tomorrow, I've
really done it all.


242
0:12:0,67 --> 0:12:2,68
I've made a lot of
people happy.


243
0:12:2,68 --> 0:12:5,61
I've been with lots
of young people.


244
0:12:5,61 --> 0:12:10,21
Showed them the way, very
nice and enjoyed it.


245
0:12:10,21 --> 0:12:13,78
Made my own families with people
that were with me.


246
0:12:13,78 --> 0:12:16,57
The ladies in the other
room, one of them is


247
0:12:16,57 --> 0:12:18,37
28 years with me.


248
0:12:18,37 --> 0:12:19,68
It's family stuff.


249
0:12:19,68 --> 0:12:20,82
It's just family.


250
0:12:20,82 --> 0:12:23,67
And it's rich, totally rich.


251
0:12:23,67 --> 0:14:23,67
