###688 [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]
###698 MALE SPEAKER: Hey, YouTube!
###700 Welcome to Set List, Stand-Up Without a Net.
###702 Now here's your host, Paul Provenza!
###704 
###708 PAUL PROVENZA: Thank you.
###710 Good evening.
###712 Hello, YouTube.
###713 
###716 What are you doing with your lives?
###719 Welcome to Set List, Stand-Up Without a Net.
###722 It's very exciting.
###723 This is our first live stream ever.
###725 It's really, really exciting for us because stands--
###728 Set List is a different kind of stand up comedy show.
###730 Set List is unique.
###733 Now normally when you see a stand up comedian perform,
###735 you're seeing them give you material that they have
###737 created, they have crafted, they have honed, they have
###740 perfected, to give you the very best
###742 for your comedy value.
###745 That's too much hard work.
###746 None of that happens here.
###749 What happens here is far more dangerous.
###751 The comedians are going to take a leap into the comedy
###754 unknown, ladies and gentlemen.
###756 Now let me explain what a set list is.
###759 A set list looks something like this--
###762 something like this--
###764 there you go.
###765 This is a set list for a band.
###766 It's basically the names of their titles--
###768 the titles of their songs-- in the order
###769 they're going to do them.
###770 Everybody knows what the show is.
###772 A comedian's set list?
###773 A little bit different.
###775 Generally written on the back of the hand, because nobody
###779 else has to see it.
###780 And these words here--
###781 who knows what they mean?
###783 Only the comedian knows what's on their set list.
###785 Two words could be 15 minutes of material.
###787 It could be a phrase they want to remember to try out.
###789 Who knows?
###790 It could mean anything.
###791 Only the comedian knows.
###792 Well, tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we are taking out
###795 of that comfort zone some of the finest
###797 comedians in America.
###798 They are coming up here without a
###800 set list of any kind.
###801 We are going to give them a set list.
###803 They are going to improvise a stand up comedy routine out of
###806 thin air for your sadistic enjoyment.
###811 [APPLAUSE]
###817 Here's an example of some of the kinds of items we'll be
###820 giving them.
###821 Shame Ringtone, I think you know when that one comes in.
###825 Caucasionally.
###826 
###829 Violent Vegan Poetry.
###832 Frenema.
###832 I could do 10 minutes on that myself, folks.
###836 But we guarantee that none of the set list items that the
###839 comedians will be given tonight have appeared on any
###841 comedian's set list ever.
###844 They've never seen them.
###846 You've never seen them.
###847 They will come up here, they will appear on the screen one
###849 at a time, the comedians will see their set list topics at
###852 the exact same moment that you see them for
###853 the very first time.
###855 We're not only taking them out of their comfort zone by
###857 leaving them up here with set lists they have never
###859 imagined, we're also taking them out of their comfort zone
###862 with subject matter or topics or whatever.
###864 The whole point is to watch the moment of creation.
###868 It is a journey, ladies and gentlemen.
###870 Enjoy it.
###873 The comedians have one rule.
###875 That is, use your material--
###877 excuse me.
###878 Sorry.
###879 I just said the worst thing you could say.
###882 Their rule is use your
###883 imaginations, not your material.
###888 You play a very big part here.
###889 Your role is, don't be a dick.
###894 OK?
###894 They're coming out here, leaping into the comedy abyss
###896 with nothing protecting them but really fragile egos.
###900 You must be the wind under their wings.
###902 You must carry them to the comedic heights.
###905 You're a big part of this.
###906 You can watch the process, you can see how each comedian
###909 deals differently with this.
###911 Show them your support.
###911 Show them your love.
###913 Don't be the guy who goes to the circus and hopes the
###916 tightrope walker doesn't make it.
###918 
###921 That's all you have to do, ladies and gentlemen.
###924 And I think it'll become self-explanatory.
###926 Should we just crack on and give it a go?
###928 [APPLAUSE]
###929 All right!
###930 Keep that energy going, ladies and gentlemen.
###934 For your first fearless set lister, here at Set List,
###938 Stand-Up Without a Net, live streaming on YouTube, ladies
###942 and gentlemen, the never before seen set
###944 list of Mr. John Dore!
###946 
###952 JOHN DORE: Hi.
###952 Thank you, Paul.
###953 
###956 Oh, boy.
###958 Here we go.
###960 Stand up without a net.
###962 Set list.
###964 All right.
###965 
###968 I'm gonna let you in on a little secret I've never told
###970 anyone ever before, but this is a fact.
###973 
###976 I am straight.
###978 
###981 Never told anyone that before, but that's one of the reasons
###986 the US government asked me to do something very special.
###989 They asked me to go and spy for the Chinese.
###992 And you're probably wondering, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
###993 whoa, Steve.
###994 And I would say, name's John.
###996 And then you would say, sorry.
###998 John, I thought you were spying for the Chinese.
###1002 It's like, yeah, but who you think funds the operation?
###1005 The United States.
###1006 And that's right.
###1007 I spy for the Chinese.
###1008 You're probably wondering what I do for the Chinese.
###1010 Like, are you concerned?
###1012 Like, do you wonder what I do for the Chinese?
###1014 Do you want to know what I do for the Chinese?
###1015 Well I'm not going to fucking tell you, am I, because then I
###1017 wouldn't be a very good spy.
###1020 You saying yes, I want to know what you do for the Chinese,
###1022 means you want to see me dead right here on the spot.
###1024 So that's what you want?
###1026 Unbelievable.
###1028 Unberievable, as some people would say.
###1030 But I'll tell you this right now.
###1032 That's only when I'm spying, I'll say unberievable.
###1035 Only when I'm spying.
###1036 
###1039 Because, yes, I stereotypically have to fit in
###1042 with the Chinese, all right?
###1043 And they traditionally have trouble with L's and R's.
###1047 Now let's move on to the next topic before I get really
###1049 racist, all right?
###1051 I [? confess ?]
###1052 for every one at home and in the audience and myself.
###1057 Oh, boy.
###1058 Oh, yeah.
###1059 
###1065 One summer I went camping with my uncle, and, uh--.
###1070 [APPLAUSE]
###1073 All right, let's move on.
###1074 Let's move on.
###1074 All right.
###1076 Sometimes that's all you need, I guess.
###1078 I don't know.
###1078 Let's move on.
###1079 Or maybe there's more.
###1080 Don't move on.
###1080 Maybe there is more.
###1081 Oh, we moved on.
###1082 Can we go back?
###1083 Oh, we can't go back now!
###1085 
###1089 What do you mean, oh no?
###1091 I don't know if you can hear at home, but a lady
###1092 just said, oh no.
###1094 Like you've had an abortune.
###1096 You don't even know what an abortune is.
###1098 You can't oh no it.
###1100 That word doesn't exist until it came up on the screen.
###1103 Oh no, he's going to talk about abortunes.
###1105 Unbeliev--
###1106 my daughter had an abortune.
###1107 
###1111 You don't have to be a girl to have an abortune.
###1113 Guys have abortunes.
###1115 You don't even know what an abortune is.
###1117 It's not what you think, all right?
###1119 You're thinking it is-- it's a musical abortion.
###1122 That's what you're all thinking.
###1124 You're not far off, I'll give you that.
###1126 You're not far off.
###1127 You're very close.
###1129 I'll tell you what an abortune is.
###1130 
###1134 You've heard of the band Nickelback?
###1135 Have you ever heard of the band Nickelback?
###1137 That's an abortune.
###1140 Oh, that's a little--
###1140 don't clap.
###1142 I feel bad about that one for two reasons.
###1144 It is a little too easy.
###1145 Also, they are from my home country of Canada, so I feel
###1147 terrible about that.
###1149 Let's move on from-- let's go back to Rock, Paper,
###1151 Handjob if we can.
###1153 Oh, too late.
###1154 
###1157 Speaking of rock, paper, handjob, I've got to, to tell
###1159 you story here.
###1160 
###1171 This is all part of it.
###1172 This is all part of it.
###1175 Oh, god.
###1178 I used to pace like this when I was in the
###1181 lunch line at school.
###1182 
###1185 Oh, fuck me.
###1186 You get one and you're just like, oh, no what do you do?
###1189 But you know what?
###1190 You just talk it out.
###1190 You just talk it out.
###1192 
###1195 And I'd get to the front of the line at the cafeteria and
###1199 be handed my order and I'd say, excuse me, what is this?
###1206 And the lunch lady would say, none of your business.
###1209 And I'd say, no, no, no, it actually is my business.
###1211 I paid for it.
###1211 I want to know what it is.
###1214 She'd say, well, it's not in my job
###1215 description to tell you.
###1216 And I'd say, you know what?
###1217 I think it is.
###1219 I want to know what I'm putting in my body, all right?
###1221 I want to know if I'm going to be replenishing my
###1224 carbohydrates while my glycogen windows are open.
###1228 And the lunch lady says, I don't know what
###1230 you're talking about.
###1231 I didn't graduate high school.
###1233 And then I say, that's a mean joke.
###1237 Like if someone were to say that on stage, I'm glad you
###1239 said it, and some of this-- this is factual-- yeah.
###1243 
###1247 Long story short, you're going have to buy my CD if you want
###1250 to hear the end of it.
###1251 Because I haven't quite written it yet.
###1253 Don't clap.
###1253 This is horrible.
###1254 Trust me, this is horrible.
###1255 This is horrible.
###1257 Get rid of that one.
###1260 [APPLAUSE]
###1263 Uh, OK.
###1264 For this one I'm going to need a volunteer from the audience.
###1267 Uh, sir, if you don't mind just come on up here.
###1270 Thank you very much.
###1272 OK.
###1273 And stand right there for a second.
###1274 Yeah.
###1275 OK, can sit down now.
###1276 Thank you very much.
###1278 So remember where he was, right?
###1282 So my uncle would take us camping and every now and then
###1285 he would say, hey, you want to play a little RPH?
###1288 And I would say, I'd say, yo yo, what are
###1291 you, a lunch lady?
###1291 What's your agenda?
###1292 What's that mean?
###1293 And he'd say, no, I'm not a lunch lady.
###1295 It's called rock, paper, handjob.
###1297 And I'd say lookit, I'm not very comfortable with rock and
###1301 paper, but other than that, I think we've got a deal here.
###1304 And long story longer, um, ladies and gentleman, I'm
###1311 going to introduce my uncle to you right now.
###1313 Actually, no, he's not here to do that.
###1314 But if he was here, I'd be very proud to say he gives one
###1318 of the better handjobs, because--
###1320 and I know you're thinking that's disgusting.
###1322 It is not disgusting.
###1323 It's tender.
###1323 It was very tender.
###1324 He wasn't rude about.
###1326 It wasn't rude about it at all.
###1327 It didn't feel like incest at any moment.
###1330 It just felt natural.
###1331 It felt fun.
###1332 It felt--
###1332 felt familiar.
###1333 Do you know what I mean?
###1334 And the reason it felt familiar's because of course
###1336 we share genes.
###1338 And we share jeans.
###1340 So he's like--
###1342 OK, let's skip it.
###1343 I don't know what else is going to happen with that one.
###1346 The people watching at home just--
###1348 hey, anyone know the score of the Sens game?
###1350 That'll prove this is live, by the way.
###1351 No?
###1352 Anyone know who the Sens are?
###1353 They're a hockey team from Ottawa.
###1354 Grow the fuck up.
###1355 All right.
###1356 
###1359 Um.
###1360 
###1362 OK, here's the thing.
###1365 Don't transfer me, OK?
###1367 Leave me in the jail.
###1368 I do not want you to transfer me.
###1370 I do not need to go anywhere.
###1371 I got a really funny feeling about this and besides, you
###1373 haven't even heard me out yet, all right?
###1375 
###1378 You ever gone duck hunting in the city?
###1380 It sounds crazy, but I'll tell you something.
###1384 It is loads of fun.
###1387 And rarely--
###1388 the problem is, he didn't hear me say duck, all right?
###1391 So that's what city duck hunting is.
###1394 You yell duck and hope the gentleman ducks.
###1397 And if he doesn't then the lady's going to have brain on
###1401 her dress and that's just a fact.
###1403 OK, lookit, I know I'm in America, and--
###1405 
###1408 too soon?
###1409 Too soon, is that it?
###1410 Probably too late is what it is.
###1412 It's too late.
###1414 And guys, you can ew it if you want, but
###1417 this is my big closer.
###1420 You know what?
###1421 Fuck it.
###1421 I'm done.
###1422 I'm absolutely finished.
###1423 [APPLAUSE]
###1426 Hey, Paul.
###1428 Sorry about that.
###1428 No, I'm--
###1429 I'm done.
###1430 PAUL PROVENZA: What are you sorry about, John?
###1431 JOHN DORE: Oh, just I'll see you later.
###1433 If you hear a gunshot go off, that's me.
###1436 PAUL PROVENZA: John Dore, ladies and gentlemen!
###1438 [APPLAUSE]
###1440 Oh, ho ho.
###1443 Oh.
###1444 That was some fancy skating there, John Dore.
###1447 You Canuck.
###1449 Um.
###1450 Well, that's how Set List works.
###1451 Pretty clear, eh?
###1453 It's like weaving gold out of lead.
###1456 It's alchemy, what happens here on the
###1458 stage, ladies and gentlemen.
###1459 And we're going to kick it off again
###1460 with this next gentleman.
###1461 A Set--
###1462 a favorite of Set List, he's one of our UK cousins.
###1465 Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for your next fearless
###1468 Set Lister?
###1469 
###1471 Ladies and gentlemen, the never before seen set list of
###1474 the brilliant Mr. Matt Kirshen.
###1475 
###1480 MATT KIRSHEN: Yeah.
###1482 Yeah.
###1485 Hey.
###1486 Hello, the internet.
###1489 Uh, I just want to thank you for being here in the room.
###1492 For those you all watching at home, if you do choose to
###1495 comment underneath our video, just remember
###1498 my mum reads them.
###1500 
###1502 So maybe call her something as well.
###1504 
###1508 She'd love to be a faggot.
###1509 She would.
###1510 She would love--
###1513 she's a woman in her sixties, you know.
###1517 No way she'd be as well-dressed as a derogatory
###1520 term for a gay man.
###1523 I did one of their shows on Monday, and eh.
###1525 That seemed to be the go to.
###1527 So never read the comments.
###1529 Let's see what you got.
###1531 
###1536 One of the things that's nice about growing up in Europe is
###1544 how much more fancy things seem.
###1546 
###1549 It's the joy of coming to America as a Brit.
###1553 You're like, everything just sounds that little bit nicer.
###1558 Is it a burning sensation as you pee or is
###1562 it a tingling fountain?
###1564 
###1568 Is it a unsightly rash or are you dappled?
###1572 
###1575 Speckled, if you will.
###1578 Horribly, horribly infected with a disease that's caused
###1584 exclusively by sticking a part of a human in
###1587 another part of a human--
###1590 or koala.
###1591 
###1593 That's the only other species I know of that gets chlamydia.
###1597 That is a fact.
###1599 Most of these people are connected to the internet.
###1601 Check it out.
###1602 Koala chlamydia.
###1603 Genuine problem.
###1605 So like to point out, nothing to do with me.
###1611 I don't necessarily want that association.
###1613 I know how Google bombing works.
###1615 I know it wouldn't take too much effort for it to be the
###1618 case that when you start typing in my name, koala
###1621 chlamydia is the next thing that comes up.
###1625 It's a the risk I'm willing to take, the internet.
###1627 
###1640 Here's the thing.
###1643 If you're in prison--
###1645 I've never been in prison, but I imagine if I were, I would
###1650 be kneeling a lot.
###1651 
###1654 [APPLAUSE]
###1662 There's very little that I could get in [? Cajun ?].
###1665 Maybe--
###1665 I don't know--
###1666 I could be a librarian, maybe.
###1671 Teach some of the fellow prisoners how to get through
###1675 their prison degree.
###1678 But we know that's not my job's going to be.
###1680 
###1683 I will at best--
###1689 I would probably be on my knees in a cell, but I'd maybe
###1695 be able to find religion, find faith, go to the chaplain's
###1700 room and be on my knees there.
###1703 I wouldn't escape it, is what I'm saying.
###1704 I--
###1706 you don't want to be in prison with a face and cheekbones of
###1711 a choir boy, which I have and will always have.
###1716 I think I could be like, seventy, gray, and balding,
###1719 and I'll still look like a sort of withered choir boy.
###1725 I'll look like a choir boy with a wasting disease.
###1727 
###1730 Those diseases--
###1731 it's like that genetic condition that very few people
###1734 have the way they look 60 from the age of 12.
###1738 That that'll be me, age 60.
###1740 Probably be me and the real thing.
###1742 We could talk together.
###1745 And I'd be in prison with that.
###1747 I don't know why I'd be in prison.
###1748 There are very few things that I'd be willing to do that
###1750 would put me in prison, but--
###1753 we've all killed a man.
###1756 We've all done a bit of murder, right?
###1758 No one's watching this.
###1759 This isn't a confession.
###1760 Next topic.
###1762 
###1778 There must've been, there must've been
###1780 some sheepish ones.
###1781 There must've been some, like, there must've been these some
###1784 closet-- like, I think once you got to the mid, mid to
###1787 late '30s in Germany, you pretty much-- like it's harder
###1790 to not be a Nazi than to be a Nazi, right?
###1792 I think, you know, people mostly went for
###1794 the whole Nazi thing.
###1795 But there's got to be a few like at the beginning, you
###1798 know, late '20s, early '30s, where there'll be like one guy
###1804 who's all proud.
###1804 He's like, heil Hitler and he's doing--
###1806 I don't--
###1807 I was about to do the mustache but I don't think
###1808 they did the mustache.
###1810 
###1813 But they'd be doing like the thing and there'd be a couple
###1814 in the back who were like, oh, maybe.
###1816 
###1821 Just sneaking their way there.
###1823 One day, one day I'll have strength in numbers.
###1828 For the moment I'm just going to hate
###1831 them lot from a distance.
###1834 I'm going to hide there and just--
###1835 
###1838 it's quite adorable until you do the full salute, isn't it?
###1842 I never realized how lovely.
###1844 Like until you-- like once you full up do the whole straight
###1846 and throw it right up then that's like no, that's bad,
###1848 that's unpleasant.
###1849 But just a little bit of the ways?
###1850 
###1853 You know, if you go a little-- go the full way and it's full
###1856 on heil Hitler.
###1856 But you just go a little bit it's like cooey.
###1858 You know?
###1860 Kind of adorable, it's--
###1863 it's the way you'd, you'd wave to, like, the
###1866 daughter of your neighbor.
###1867 
###1875 That's the difference.
###1876 Just a slight flex in the arm and a wiggle.
###1878 That's all it takes.
###1878 That--
###1879 that's the difference between genocide and adorable.
###1881 
###1891 OK.
###1892 You're going to have to move it on to the next topic.
###1895 I could bluff off this one.
###1896 I could bullshit my way through this one, but I did
###1899 Set List a month ago and that topic came
###1901 up and I'm not cheesing.
###1902 Next topic.
###1903 
###1909 Can we go back a topic?
###1911 
###1922 I was raised Jewish, and--
###1926 no.
###1927 I can't--
###1927 I can't do Nazi and then instantly going into
###1929 anti-Semitism as well.
###1930 I can't do that in a row.
###1933 Really engaging.
###1935 
###1939 It's gotta be--
###1940 it's a bit suspicious that we all lose our teeth.
###1943 
###1948 It's a little bit suspicious, isn't it?
###1950 Supposedly it's so that bigger teeth can grow through, but do
###1955 we really need the bigger teeth?
###1957 Like I--
###1958 I think--
###1960 I think I would do perfectly well with--
###1962 I've got quite big teeth and I don't think they
###1965 need to be this big.
###1966 I think if I just had the original lot, I'd look fine.
###1972 I don't think it's evolution that is responsible for us
###1976 having the second set of teeth coming through,
###1978 the first half leaving.
###1981 I don't believe in God.
###1983 I don't believe in Santa.
###1986 But I once put a tooth under my pillow, and when I woke up
###1990 in the morning, that tooth was gone and money was there.
###1995 Explain that, science.
###1996 
###2000 Explain that, Professor Richard Dawkins.
###2004 If that is your real name.
###2007 You explain that.
###2009 Some stuff you can't work out.
###2010 Occam's razor.
###2012 Likeliest solution is the most--
###2015 happened.
###2016 
###2018 It's the exact wording, including that pause.
###2020 Go to the Oxford English Dictionary.
###2021 That's how it happens.
###2021 Maybe not Webster's, maybe not in America.
###2023 Oxford has got that awkward pause.
###2027 Go to Oxford Dictionary, that's the definition.
###2028 Occam's razor.
###2029 Most likely solution is m-- happens.
###2033 That's how we do it. 'Cause in Britain, more adorable.
###2035 We already proved that.
###2037 So--
###2039 no, what's more likely?
###2041 That there's a genetic, there's an evolutionary reason
###2043 for one row of tooth-- of teeth to leave and another row
###2046 of teeth to grow in?
###2048 Or that there's some weird imp, some freakish, smaller
###2056 than average, semi-magical creature, that wants
###2060 children's teeth for a reason?
###2063 
###2066 We just tell our kids this.
###2068 We tell our kids there's the--
###2070 that's the-- that's fucking horrible.
###2071 That is a awful thing--
###2074 I mean they--
###2074 no, not adult teeth.
###2075 They just want children's teeth.
###2078 The tooth fairy, there's only one thing, and it specifically
###2080 wants the teeth of children.
###2082 Once you're over a certain age it's teeth are of
###2084 no interest to you.
###2087 The children's teeth, they do it.
###2089 Just for a ritual.
###2090 Just so--
###2091 I don't actually imagine the tooth fairy lives in some
###2092 building this made entirely of children's teeth.
###2097 That's--
###2097 I've never got that noise out of people on stage before.
###2101 I've been doing stand up for a while.
###2102 I've never said something that has actually got
###2103 people to go, ughhh.
###2106 That was a visceral reaction I got off that.
###2108 That was as if at one point in your childhood you actually
###2111 went to a building that was all children's teeth.
###2114 And I just stirred up a horrendous memory and now
###2116 you're gonna have to go to counseling and it's my fault.
###2118 
###2128 Well, you'd have to write it in blood, wouldn't you?
###2131 
###2135 I guess if you were, like, if you were a--
###2138 if you were a graffiti artist who was a bit sad--
###2144 well more than a bit sad.
###2145 You have to be very sad to commit suicide.
###2147 If you're a bit sad don't commit--
###2150 don't commit suicide anyway.
###2151 If you're watching this and complement--
###2152 contemplating suicide, I mean I shouldn't be the one to tell
###2156 you this, but, like, get help.
###2160 OK?
###2160 Don't--
###2162 I hope I've cheered you up a bit.
###2166 I hope I haven't stirred up a memory of you being in a house
###2168 of teeth and that was the final straw.
###2172 Go open a different tab.
###2173 Stop watching us for a second and go to-- there's plenty of
###2176 help things.
###2178 But if you do insist on it, if you've really
###2184 made up your mind--
###2185 and I mean really--
###2187 but still get help.
###2188 But if you've really made up your mind, make an effort.
###2193 You know, there aren't enough adventurous
###2195 suicides these days.
###2196 If you--
###2198 draw-- draw something pretty with the blood as you're--
###2201 you know, you've got a limited amount of time, so don't go
###2203 too adventurous.
###2204 We're not talking Sistine Chapel here.
###2207 Maybe something funny so when they discover you they're
###2211 like, ahhh-- ha ha ha.
###2213 
###2217 Like a rabbit with a massive cock and balls, or
###2219 something like that.
###2221 Just in blood.
###2222 Just something that makes them go, well, this is sad.
###2226 But not as sad as it could be.
###2230 It's what he would have wanted.
###2233 A final little giggle.
###2237 And just-- and they don't call it-- and that-- but like the
###2239 person would hear that noise.
###2241 They'd go like, what happened?
###2242 What happened?
###2242 And they'd burst in as well and do exactly the same thing,
###2244 one after another, including--
###2246 and then the ambulance guys as well.
###2247 But they probably seen it before.
###2251 Listen, it's been a pleasure talking to you.
###2253 Enjoy the rest of your show.
###2254 I've been Matt Kirshen.
###2255 Thank you, the internet.
###2257 PAUL PROVENZA: Matt Kirshen!
###2259 
###2262 Matt Kirshen, ladies and gentlemen.
###2263 
###2268 Uh, and it's true what he about koalas, by the way.
###2272 
###2276 It's not just a cover story.
###2278 It's true.
###2279 Um, yeah, you guys having a good time?
###2282 
###2284 You folks at home?
###2286 All of you when you get a chance check out the Nerdist
###2288 Channel series of Set List, Stand-Up Without a Net.
###2292 One going up every week.
###2293 Just check when-- soon as you're done watching th--
###2296 not now.
###2297 Fuck it.
###2299 Let's bring out our next fearless Set
###2300 Lister, what do you say?
###2302 
###2307 Ladies and gentlemen, will you welcome the never before seen
###2310 set list of another favorite of ours, the brilliant Miss
###2313 Kira Soltanovich!
###2314 
###2321 KIRA SOLTANOVICH: Thank you.
###2323 It's Paul Provenza, guys, right?
###2325 It's exciting stuff.
###2327 Look at you.
###2328 You got dropped off here by an adult, right?
###2330 Good for you!
###2332 That's exciting!
###2333 You're out.
###2334 You're on a date.
###2334 With your-- with Jude Law.
###2338 You're going to lose your virginity tonight.
###2341 It's going to happen for you, right?
###2343 It's going to happen.
###2344 You excited?
###2345 OK.
###2345 I'm excited for you.
###2347 Can I watch?
###2348 Is that inappropriate?
###2349 All right.
###2351 Hey, you guys who are watching on the internet!
###2353 Pull your pants up, you perverts.
###2355 
###2357 Nah, keep 'em down.
###2358 It's fine.
###2359 It's fine.
###2360 It doesn't matter to me.
###2361 I don't care.
###2362 I'm just going to talk to fine folks, youngsters over here.
###2365 Oh, is this like a high school?
###2367 Did a bus drop you guys off?
###2369 Holy cow.
###2372 All right.
###2373 Let's have some fun, you know?
###2374 We're going to discuss some things.
###2376 A lot of them will go directly over your head, young
###2378 man, but it's OK.
###2380 Whatever anyone around you is laughing, you laugh too.
###2384 All right?
###2385 And you will be just fine.
###2387 Oh, man.
###2388 Speaking of feeling old, right?
###2390 
###2395 You know, I'm just a creature of habit.
###2400 I'm going to tell you guys right now.
###2403 I really am.
###2404 Here's what it is.
###2405 You know, you do get set in your ways.
###2407 You know what I mean?
###2408 You get set in your ways.
###2410 I was just printing up something-- like something I
###2414 wrote-- on my dot matrix earlier today, and--
###2418 it's a printer that goes like this, [BUZZES].
###2420 
###2427 And then after that one line is done--
###2429 
###2435 you don't even know what dot matrix is.
###2436 Do you have any idea?
###2437 You don't know.
###2438 Is it a shoe brand?
###2440 Is it the new Christian band out there?
###2443 Is it--
###2444 the Dot Matrix!
###2445 Ahhhh!
###2447 For Jesus!
###2448 
###2451 No.
###2452 It's a printer, all right?
###2453 
###2456 And I'm not going to get rid of it, all right?
###2458 I'm not.
###2459 With your fancy I can print off a smartphone, wh--
###2465 how smart is a smartphone if you can't
###2469 type in the word boobless?
###2472 How smart?
###2473 
###2475 Oh, did I just blow your minds?
###2478 That's right.
###2479 You don't even know what a pager is, do you?
###2481 You don't even know.
###2482 Oh, my god.
###2484 Do you even know what a crackhead is?
###2486 Because that's what pagers were used for--
###2490 for crackheads.
###2493 Were your parents born in the '80s?
###2495 How old are you, is my question.
###2498 I do.
###2498 I still use one.
###2499 I still use it.
###2500 I'll tell you why.
###2501 I'll tell you why.
###2502 And it's not because I'm a drug dealer from
###2504 a few decades ago.
###2506 It's because I never went to medical school.
###2509 
###2512 And I'm constantly waiting for a table.
###2515 
###2520 I figure, why not beat 'em to the punch?
###2522 Boom.
###2522 We'll let you know when your table at the Cheesecake
###2525 Factory is ready.
###2525 I go no.
###2527 No.
###2528 I'll let you know.
###2531 When this goes [BUZZ]
###2532 boobless [BUZZ]
###2535 I will seat myself.
###2536 Boom.
###2537 In your face.
###2538 
###2541 And then I also pretend like I have surgery.
###2542 
###2549 Oh, goodness.
###2551 So, uh, if you guys don't know anything about me, Soltanovich
###2555 is my last name, Soltanovich.
###2557 So yes, I am a Soviet Communist.
###2562 Thank you.
###2563 And uh--
###2564 you don't even know what that is.
###2566 Uh, just--
###2568 nothing in the front row is going to [? know ?] that one.
###2570 Um, so the first stereotype you think of when you think of
###2575 Russians, liquid people.
###2577 That's right.
###2579 That's right.
###2580 We eat our breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
###2582 Guess what?
###2583 We don't care.
###2584 That's the stereotype that you think about us.
###2586 Thank you for saying hot.
###2587 I appreciate that.
###2587 That's also the second one.
###2591 We are.
###2591 We are liquid people.
###2593 It's one of those things where we don't like to talk about
###2597 it, because why bring it up?
###2599 Why talk about something that is both fun--
###2602 vodka--
###2604 and destructive--
###2606 drinking every meal?
###2609 We don't bring it up.
###2612 We don't want to be judged by you, or you.
###2615 Everyone else is cool.
###2616 I don't mind if anyone else judges us, just not this boy
###2620 band in the front row.
###2622 They're making me very uneasy.
###2623 
###2626 But it's true.
###2627 It's true.
###2628 Hey, are Asian people bad drivers?
###2630 Not all of them, come on.
###2633 Not all of them.
###2634 When they're doing math while driving,
###2635 yes, that's very dangerous.
###2636 
###2640 Do all Mexicans have lawnmowers?
###2642 I don't know.
###2644 I don't hang out with Mexicans.
###2647 Are all Russians liquid people?
###2650 Yes.
###2652 Yes, we are.
###2654 And we're not ashamed of it.
###2657 Or of our pagers.
###2660 I'm not going to be ashamed of a pager, everybody.
###2662 I'm not going-- you're not going to shame me.
###2664 
###2668 Oh, if I could impart any kind of wisdom
###2670 on you young people--
###2674 you young, young people-- first thing I would do is take
###2677 out your smartphone and Google Lionel Richie.
###2680 
###2683 'Cause you don't know who that is.
###2686 If I could impart-- seriously, I'm being serious right now--
###2688 let's just really get down to brass tacks,
###2691 as they say, right?
###2692 Which is a new band.
###2693 
###2696 We sometimes in life-- you know what I mean-- you come to
###2699 a fork in the road.
###2701 It zigs when you want to zag.
###2703 Which way do I go?
###2704 What do I do?
###2705 Do I finish junior high?
###2707 Go to DeVry?
###2708 What-- what do I?
###2710 Change my liquid every meal?
###2712 What do I do?
###2713 And if you don't believe in a higher power, you know what I
###2717 mean, and if no one on Facebook is giving you good
###2719 advice, do what I do, you guys.
###2724 And I have lived by this.
###2726 And I have lived a very fulful-- fulfil--
###2729 I don't want to even say the word because it's
###2732 that full of fill.
###2734 It's a very fulfilled life.
###2737 It's fulfilling out of my face.
###2740 Alliteration.
###2741 Boom.
###2741 You try it.
###2744 Here's what I do when I get stuck and I say,
###2746 god, what do I do?
###2748 Please, universe out there?
###2751 And it's always the same thing.
###2753 It is always the same thing.
###2758 Dancing on the ceiling.
###2759 
###2762 Think about it.
###2764 
###2766 It's all you have to do.
###2767 Just look up to that ceiling and you dance on it.
###2770 Look him up.
###2771 Wikipedia.
###2772 Thank you so much.
###2773 My name's Kira Soltanovich.
###2775 PAUL PROVENZA: Kira Soltanovich!
###2776 
###2781 Kira Soltanovich.
###2782 
###2786 Folks, this is a nice time to give a big round of applause
###2789 to the evil genius creator and the man behind the Set List,
###2792 Mr. Troy Conrad.
###2793 
###2800 And I'm anxious to see this next journey we're going to go
###2803 on, ladies and gentlemen, because this tour guide takes
###2806 us to places we don't often go.
###2807 Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for your next fearless
###2810 Set Lister?
###2812 Give it up for the never before seen set list of Mr.
###2814 Moshe Kasher!
###2816 
###2822 MOSHE KASHER: All right, all right.
###2823 OK.
###2824 It's been pretty good so far, huh?
###2827 Yeah.
###2828 I'm about to take a shit on that right now.
###2831 I don't know, straight up don't know, I straight up
###2834 can't do this.
###2835 I just fucking can't do it.
###2837 In the back I heard them.
###2838 They were talking.
###2839 They were like, we're running a little low on time.
###2841 Make 'em go quicker.
###2842 This is the fucking internet.
###2843 Why-- there's nothing--
###2845 is something else happening afterwards?
###2848 Is there a live stream of "Two Girls, One Cup" we're
###2850 about to get into?
###2851 I think we'll be OK if we go a little long on the internet.
###2855 You know, the place where they store all of the information?
###2858 
###2867 Sometimes I write jokes that I find disrespectful myself.
###2871 The very topic of my own joke I find to be offensive.
###2875 I wrote a joke about this when I was younger, when I had a
###2878 less nuanced idea of sexuality.
###2881 I thought oh, it'd be funny if I wrote a long joke about how
###2883 I fuck old-ass people--
###2886 brittle-ass hips, popping bones--
###2889 from the streets.
###2890 I'm a straight up gangster.
###2890 I'm a Crip.
###2892 What's up?
###2893 What's up?
###2895 Find me.
###2895 YouTube.com/anonymous.
###2900 So I wrote this long bit about how I sleep with old people so
###2903 that you don't have to.
###2904 But then I started doing it for real
###2906 because what would happen--
###2907 I started off comedy like, 1920, 1922.
###2910 I was basically the first dude.
###2911 It was me, it was Mel--
###2913 Mel B-- we called him Mel B back then, Mel Brooks.
###2917 It was Sammy Davis, Jr. We didn't like him because of--
###2919 you know.
###2920 And--
###2922 because of the lazy eye.
###2923 What was happening for you guys in that?
###2925 Anyway, I was the young dude.
###2927 They call me the young cat, the Crip of comedy.
###2930 The Crips had started at that point, 1922.
###2933 And I started doing my big closer, which was I sleep with
###2936 the elderly.
###2936 And then I-- and then I'd go like this and everybody would
###2938 say, so that you don't have to.
###2940 And I'd be like, that's my time, y'all.
###2941 And then I'd just ejaculate.
###2943 
###2945 That was what comedy was like before all those
###2947 standards and practices.
###2948 That's why we're getting back to the internet.
###2950 I first started comedy on the internet in 1922.
###2952 Here's the point.
###2953 What ended up happening was as a result of my big closer--
###2956 I sleep with the elderly so that you don't have to-- after
###2958 the show I would just be lined up, just like the guy-- just
###2961 like lines of just senior citizens.
###2963 I mean straight up cr-- people-- dialysis,
###2966 they were just like.
###2967 You know what I mean?
###2968 They were just like, one favor. .
###2969 Just pound it out before I go.
###2971 You know what I mean?
###2972 Pound it out before I go.
###2974 That's what they would say.
###2975 They were very weird old people.
###2978 And so I would.
###2979 I would do that.
###2980 I started to-- slowly, over the time, over the course of
###2982 my comedy career--
###2983 I started to just knock boots with many an old person.
###2986 And I started to realize the flaw in my very--
###2989 in my own joke, which is that I don't sleep with the elderly
###2992 so you don't have to.
###2993 I sleep with the elderly so that I can.
###2995 It's the best.
###2996 It's better than-- what do you want a young woman for?
###2999 [INAUDIBLE]
###3000 I fuck women, surprise.
###3001 What do you-- you know what I mean?
###3002 Like, what do I want a young woman for?
###3004 Bad conversation and, like, perfect body?
###3006 No thanks.
###3007 I want some--
###3008 I want some leather.
###3009 You know what I mean?
###3011 I want to slide--
###3012 I want to pull it around myself like a lap band.
###3015 
###3018 I sleep with the elderly because I can.
###3020 
###3023 Yeah.
###3024 
###3029 Yeah, there's a lot of people that are going to have a lot
###3031 of explaining to do when they get up-- first of all, Jesus.
###3034 I'm a Jew.
###3034 Not real.
###3035 But--
###3036 
###3039 no, he's real.
###3040 He's just--
###3041 a really real great guy.
###3045 No, I'm just--
###3045 I'm sure, I'm sure he's up there.
###3047 I'm sure he's got a beard and he's going to be all floating
###3049 when-- you know what I mean?
###3050 He's going to be like, hello, and welcome to heaven.
###3052 You'll be like, uh, Jesus, why do you sound like a ghost?
###3054 He's like, I always have been a ghost.
###3056 And then he'll pull off is own face and it'll be like the--
###3059 it'll be the father--
###3060 God, the Father, and he'll pull it off again and it'll be
###3061 God, the son, and he'll pull it off again and it'll be the
###3063 Holy Ghost.
###3064 Holy Ghost, get it?
###3065 A ha ha ha.
###3066 And then it'll be like, you laugh like the Count and he'll
###3069 be like, I'm also the Count.
###3070 I am all things.
###3071 All things are possible for me.
###3072 No one gets to heaven but by me.
###3074 And I'd be like, I'm Jewish.
###3075 And he'd be like, me too.
###3076 The point--
###3078 the point is, if Jesus is standing at the pearly gates
###3084 or whatever, and people get up there,
###3086 there's a lot of people--
###3087 I'm on Twitter, @moshekasher, please follow me--
###3089 and there's a lot of people who're going to have a lot of
###3092 explaining to do.
###3093 A lot of you YouTube people are going to have a lot of
###3094 explaining to do.
###3095 You know what I mean?
###3096 We go to church on Sunday, but then you log onto the internet
###3099 and bully some kid--
###3100 you know what I mean-- maybe some kid who's maybe 33 years
###3102 old and trying his best to make a career at stand up
###3104 comedy that doesn't need these negative
###3106 comments all the time.
###3108 You're going to have to explain your maker, Jesus--
###3110 the magic man--
###3112 
###3116 why you say I look like Buddy Holly, why you say I look like
###3118 Harry Potter, why you say I look like every white person
###3121 with glasses that has ever existed.
###3122 
###3129 And then Jesus will be like, have you met Rob Delaney?
###3133 I love that guy.
###3134 Great jokes.
###3137 And then I'll be like, yeah, I met him.
###3141 He was the main bully on Twitter this whole time.
###3145 
###3154 I'm into some freaky shit, right?
###3157 No, I am.
###3158 But I'm not--
###3159 I'm not, I'm not the best.
###3160 I mean, I'm--
###3161 I'm the best stand up comedian you'll ever see, obviously.
###3163 
###3166 Thank you so much, guys.
###3167 
###3170 But I'm not the best at S&M.
###3172 I didn't invent the shit.
###3173 You know what I mean?
###3175 I'm an amateur at best.
###3177 Every year there's the AVN in Las Vegas, where they-- they
###3180 honor all the best pornographers in the world and
###3182 they give awards away for things like that.
###3183 I've won many an award--
###3185 the best lap band act out, I won that award--
###3190 but not everybody knows this.
###3191 That's the hotels in Las Vegas-- the AVN pornography
###3194 awards-- if you go to that-- the AVN awards--
###3196 you take the elevator to the basement and then you walk
###3198 down five more flights.
###3199 In the dungeon of the AVN awards is the dungeon
###3202 captivity awards.
###3203 Now, some of the first winners of this were of course the
###3205 Spanish, for the Spanish Inquisition.
###3207 They won a lot of great awards for that.
###3209 There was course the "Goodbye Horses" guy.
###3212 Tuck your dick between your legs, that was his move.
###3214 "Goodbye Horses," that was an improv.
###3216 That was-- he was doing Set List.
###3218 I'm serious.
###3219 The "Goodbye Horses" guy, this was straight up-- it just said
###3221 fucking do some freaky shit.
###3222 And he just tucked and he went for it.
###3224 That guy was the first winner.
###3226 
###3228 Now, I did win an award one time for spooling thread
###3232 around my own balls for more than a week,
###3233 but that was an accident.
###3235 People thought I was doing it as a performance piece because
###3237 I did film it, of course, and live stream it on [? Josh. ?]
###3240 But no, that was just an accident.
###3242 I won an amateur award.
###3243 But the greatest winner, of course, of all time--
###3245 the greatest dungeon captivity winner of all time--
###3249 do you guys know who it was?
###3252 It was the last dude.
###3253 It was the dude you have to explain Twitter to.
###3255 It was that Jesus dude for his wonderful trick, stay in a
###3258 cave for three days, float up to heaven, come back down, and
###3261 change the world.
###3264 That was Jesus.
###3265 
###3271 [LAUGHS]
###3274 I mean, it's the old dichotomy.
###3275 It's the old pussy-dick dichotomy,
###3276 you know what I mean?
###3279 Which way do you go, you know what I mean?
###3280 Like, sir.
###3280 You seem like a dude that has fucked a hermaphrodite or two
###3282 in your day.
###3283 Like--
###3285 no, I'm saying.
###3285 When you go out to-- let's say you're a herm--
###3286 OK, so most some hermaphrodites have made a
###3288 choice, right?
###3289 Or not a choice.
###3289 It's not a choice.
###3290 There's no choice.
###3290 But you're--
###3291 most hermaphrodites do identify with gender.
###3293 But as we all know, gender is mostly a myth.
###3294 So let's say you're a person that's really straight down
###3296 the middle, know what I mean?
###3297 Maybe you are person that has not decided male or female,
###3300 but you've got a-- you've got maybe-- you've got a Moshe
###3302 Kasher sized dick, you know what I mean, and you've got a
###3304 real nice tight teenage pussy.
###3306 And you have to make--
###3307 come on, guys, go with it.
###3308 It's the internet.
###3309 And you guys--
###3310 you've got to make a decision.
###3311 Tonight am I going to get fucked or fuck?
###3313 But you know what?
###3314 Here's the deal.
###3314 Here's the field.
###3315 Here's the seal.
###3316 Here's the Seal, "Kissed By A Rose." I've
###3318 been kissed by a rose.
###3321 As we all know-- as we all know, except for the people on
###3324 the internet who've never experienced the touch of
###3326 another's-- of a lover, that at times it's difficult.
###3331 At times it's not worth the effort.
###3332 You got out to the club.
###3333 You meet somebody.
###3334 You meet the pr-- you go to the club.
###3335 You know the club.
###3335 We all go to da club, right?
###3337 We all do that, right?
###3338 Strikes?
###3338 OK.
###3338 The point is, you go out.
###3340 You meet somebody.
###3341 You have to engage in boring conversation then you bring
###3343 them home and you guys-- you guys rut like little animals.
###3346 And you come and you're like, fuck, you're still here?
###3348 You know what I mean?
###3349 Sometimes it's not worth the effort.
###3352 There's no tough hermaphrodite decision.
###3353 You stay home, wrap into yourself,
###3356 close the deal on yourself.
###3357 It's the greatest thing anyone could do.
###3359 Don't oh.
###3360 Think, I wish.
###3361 I wish that could be me.
###3363 I truly do.
###3364 I wish you all could've experienced what it was like
###3366 to perform for you because it was a really great.
###3368 Thank you guys very much.
###3369 I'm Moshe Kasher.
###3370 Good night.
###3372 PAUL PROVENZA: Moshe Kasher!
###3373 
###3376 Wow.
###3378 
###3380 That was fun.
###3382 Folks, if any of you watching out there are in Montreal or
###3385 Chicago, we'll be at Just for Laughs festivals, we'll be at
###3387 the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland.
###3389 Come see Set List Live.
###3391 And this is really exciting.
###3392 We always have people drop in unexpectedly to do Set List
###3395 and we have a very special treat just stopped in.
###3398 We're-- this is so exciting.
###3399 Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for your next fearless
###3401 Set Lister?
###3401 Are you ready for your next fearless Set Lister?
###3403 Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the never before seen
###3406 set list of Mark Wahlberg!
###3408 
###3429 DAN VAN KIRK: How you guys doin'?
###3429 You guys doin' good?
###3431 
###3436 How you doin'?
###3438 I like the way you look, OK?
###3439 
###3443 You guys like my Voss bottle?
###3445 Celebrity edition.
###3448 You can't buy this.
###3451 It has to be given to you.
###3452 
###3457 I was like, hey, you know what?
###3459 I'm a movie star.
###3461 But I can do comedy too, OK?
###3463 
###3466 Did you guys see "Ted"?
###3467 
###3470 I destroyed that fucking movie.
###3473 Did you guys see "Pain and Gain"?
###3476 I let The Rock be in that fucking movie.
###3479 He was like, Mark, can I be in a movie with you?
###3481 I'm like, yes you can, Rock.
###3484 But you're going to stand behind me the
###3485 whole fucking time.
###3486 
###3489 He did.
###3490 
###3493 You guys ready to do this?
###3497 You're welcome.
###3498 
###3503 You guys ever feel like things were made for you?
###3505 
###3512 You know, you go into a house and you're like, I could buy
###3516 this house.
###3518 Or you put on a pair of shoes and you're like, did they make
###3521 these shoes for me?
###3524 That's how I feel about reflections.
###3526 
###3531 Sometimes I'll just be walking places on Robertson's.
###3534 It's like a street for rich people.
###3536 
###3538 And I'll just be like, who the fuck is that dude?
###3541 He looks like a hot Donny Wahlberg.
###3542 
###3545 It is a hot Donny Wahlberg.
###3547 It's me.
###3548 
###3551 Let's do another one of these.
###3552 
###3559 I'm gonna teach you guys something, OK?
###3561 
###3563 If you didn't learn this from the movie "Pain and Gain," I'm
###3567 just going to fucking spoon feed it to you.
###3570 Don't trust people in tank tops.
###3574 I'm talking about all of them, too, OK?
###3575 Out here in L.A. we got this neighborhood.
###3578 It's called Echo Park.
###3579 
###3582 Don't trust those people in tank tops.
###3585 They got credit cards with their dad's name on them.
###3589 All right?
###3590 Here's another thing.
###3591 If you live outside of the Midwest, and you're not doing
###3594 manual labor, and you have a tank top on, your car better
###3598 be broke down somewhere and you just had to walk here.
###3599 
###3602 Here's another thing.
###3604 
###3607 I'm saving you guys time right now, you know why?
###3609 'Cause I'm Mark Wahlberg.
###3612 I do good things.
###3614 Did you see "The Fighter"?
###3616 Maybe somebody else should have gotten an Academy Award
###3618 for that fucking movie, that's all I'm saying, OK?
###3621 I really fucking boxed in that movie.
###3623 They were like, Mark, do you have a
###3625 problem fighting people?
###3626 I'm like, what?
###3628 No, I don't have a problem fighting people.
###3632 I'm from Boston.
###3633 I fought my kindergarten teacher.
###3636 When I was 22.
###3637 I went back.
###3639 
###3642 Here's the last thing I'll say about this.
###3645 If you've got a pattern on your shirt, but a different
###3648 pattern on your collar, don't talk to that person.
###3651 
###3653 They don't deserve to be here and they're
###3656 willing to wait in lines.
###3660 At clubs.
###3661 In Las Vegas.
###3663 And you know what I do?
###3665 I don't wait in fucking lines, I'll tell you that much.
###3668 That's called a Donny thing.
###3670 Line waiting.
###3671 
###3680 All right, here's the deal.
###3681 
###3685 When you're a former rap star and then A-plus list
###3690 celebrity, some rules don't apply.
###3695 For example, maybe I can't read or write.
###3699 I can--
###3700 fucking assholes for laughing at that shit-- but
###3702 maybe I can't, OK?
###3703 
###3706 I got problems with the alphabet.
###3709 First of all, I never liked that fucking cereal.
###3711 
###3715 It was like Apple Jacks for smart kids.
###3717 I don't fucking want this shit.
###3718 
###3722 One time I spent two and a half hours just trying to get
###3725 my own fucking name in the bowl.
###3726 
###3730 But I got it!
###3731 M-A-R-R-K. Fucking nailed that shit.
###3734 
###3738 But people invent things to fucking make you wrong.
###3739 Like, for example--
###3741 I don't know if this applies to you guys--
###3745 but you can drive as fast as you want.
###3748 Sure, they have fucking rules for that shit, but
###3750 one, pay for it.
###3755 You guys are in movies like me, right?
###3756 We're all friends, this is a safe place?
###3758 
###3760 The other thing is you just tell them when they pull over.
###3763 Be like, that's a rule you set for yourself.
###3766 That applies to other people.
###3768 I'm Mark Wahlberg.
###3770 That doesn't apply to me.
###3772 You can try saying that.
###3772 I don't know how fucking far it'll get you.
###3776 But if you whisper it, you can get pretty fucking far.
###3778 
###3782 I'll beat one more of these.
###3783 By the way, for the record--
###3785 don't tell this to everybody else you saw tonight--
###3788 I'm winning.
###3790 
###3796 I used to not be rich.
###3798 
###3801 But I still wanted to be with a girl, OK?
###3804 So sometimes you get what you pay for.
###3808 
###3811 But it's about the exchange, OK?
###3814 So you might say to a girl, what are you willing to do for
###3817 this amount of money?
###3821 She only fucking blinked at me.
###3822 
###3825 But here's the deal--
###3828 here's the deal, OK--
###3831 I put on the song "Drive." Right?
###3835 She blinked to the beats.
###3836 
###3838 That was extra.
###3840 You guys might not get that shit, because you know why?
###3842 Newsflash.
###3843 You're not even Donny Wahlberg.
###3844 
###3847 You're like Linda Wahlberg, who nobody even fucking talks
###3849 to and I only see at family reunions.
###3852 Which you're all more than welcome to, but nobody gets to
###3855 be my partner for the egg toss, OK?
###3856 
###3859 That's reserved because I like to fucking win.
###3864 Let's do one more of these.
###3865 
###3874 You guys, I've got to tell you a secret.
###3877 I got a movie coming out, OK?
###3880 Yes, for the 32nd time, I play a cop.
###3884 
###3888 People got mad at me.
###3889 Did you guys see "The Happening"?
###3890 Everybody got so mad at that movie.
###3892 So what?
###3892 I wanted to be a teacher for one god damn
###3894 fucking time in a movie.
###3895 I wanted to be something other than a cop, OK.
###3899 But then when I sat down to write a movie, I still ended
###3903 up writing myself as a fucking cop.
###3906 Here's the deal, though.
###3909 I wrote it myself.
###3911 By hand.
###3913 You guys ever try to spell check something
###3914 you wrote by hand?
###3917 There's no fucking red lines.
###3918 
###3922 Problem being Mark fucking Wahlberg is, by the time I got
###3925 done, I went to go hand it to people, I had already sold it.
###3928 
###3931 Now we established earlier this is a safe place, OK?
###3934 So I'm going to tell you guys this.
###3936 I don't know have the heart to tell these people it's not
###3939 called "Investibation." It's called "Investigation." But I
###3947 already fucking sold that movie.
###3948 
###3952 So now I had to write in, I'm like, I'm a cop who can stop
###3954 touching himself.
###3955 And they were like--
###3956 
###3960 which, to be honest, I fucking do that shit anyway.
###3965 Thank you, guys.
###3966 You're awesome.
###3969 PAUL PROVENZA: That was Daniel van Kirk!
###3971 
###3976 Dan van Kirk.

###4734 you're most proud of?
###4736 BOB THE BAKER: I'm real proud of the album artwork, done by
###4739 my homie Mike who I haven't talked in a couple days.
###4742 Mike, call me back.
###4743 SWYNN: If you were going to be any reality show, what reality
###4746 show would you choose?
###4748 BOB THE BAKER: The Surreal Life.
###4750 It doesn't come on no more.
###4751 SWYNN: I was gonna say--
###4754 BOB THE BAKER: It was cool, though.
###4755 It was like washed up celebrities.
###4756 Vanilla Ice was on there--
###4759 heavily influenced by him.
###4760 I'd like to do things that he does in life.
###4762 Mike, call me back.
###4764 
###4768 SWYNN: If you could collaborate with anyone, who
###4770 would you want to collaborate with these days?
###4773 BOB THE BAKER: I don't like anybody is on my dopeness
###4775 level but if I could collaborate with anybody, Mike
###4778 knows this question.
###4778 Mike call me back if you--
###4780 if you can tell her this answer.
###4781 
###4786 SWYNN: Another exciting thing you have going on right now,
###4787 the Pop Pop Fest 2013--
###4790 BOB THE BAKER: --yeah--
###4791 SWYNN: --coming up here you're headlining--
###4792 BOB THE BAKER: I'm really excited for that shit as you
###4794 could tell.
###4794 Mike, take me back.
###4796 
###4800 This is where most of my dope-ass beats come from.
###4802 I usually lay them down myself.
###4805 And this is called the pan because it looks like
###4807 something that I would fry some orange chicken in.
###4810 I call this thunder.
###4813 And this is-- and this is little thunder.
###4817 And this is the one that hurts my ears, but I love it the
###4820 most because it builds character in my brain.
###4822 SWYNN: Tonight you're going to play one of the songs off your
###4824 album, so let's go forward, right?
###4827 BOB THE BAKER: Yeah.
###4827 Um, this is a track called, "Dude, I Miss You." It is not
###4830 written about anybody in particular, but if you it was
###4833 it would probably be about Mike, who
###4834 hasn't called me back.
###4835 He should do that.
###4837 [VOCALIZES SONG]
###4868 SWYNN: Um, so are you OK there, Bob?
###4874 Do you want to talk about it?
###4877 BETH HOYT: What's up, music night?
###4879 All right, coming up soon we have a set from YouTube
###4881 sensation Nice Peter.
###4883 Our next performer is a rapper who doesn't represent a
###4886 neighborhood or a city--
###4888 don't do that, Beth-- he represents a season.
###4891 As King of Summer he has released three albums,
###4894 performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, and hosts his on podcast
###4897 on the Earwolf Network, called "Who Charted?" When he's not
###4900 out dispensing summer gum he's in the studio fighting off the
###4904 winter blues.
###4905 Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Dragon Boy Suede!
###4907 
###4912 DRAGON BOY SUEDE: Hello!
###4914 Hey, guys.
###4915 Soak me in.
###4916 Soak me in at home.
###4918 How you doing?
###4919 You guys excited?
###4920 I'm making eye contact.
###4922 Who's not excited?
###4923 Who's depressed?
###4925 Who's really depressed right now?
###4927 I'll aim my show at you.
###4928 Where are the depressed people?
###4930 When I say--
###4932 when I say it's all too much, y'all say, I know!
###4937 It's all too much!
###4939 When I say what, y'all say, --'s the point.
###4945 What--
###4947 Exactly.
###4948 You guys got it.
###4950 All right, I came here to do some music.
###4951 You guys want to hear some music?
###4954 All right, here we go.
###4956 This first song is about the time that I drank two bottles
###4959 of sake, ate three Vicodin, and attempted
###4962 to do a comedy show.
###4965 It's called May 24, 2013.
###4970 Let's do it.
###4972 Give it up for my DJ.
###4973 Sounds good back there.
###4975 All right.
###4976 I'll tell you a little bit about myself.
###4978 I'm wearing a dumb blue hat.
###4982 Thanks for catching that.
###4983 I could be any villain from the movie "Taken." If it was,
###4989 like, cold in Bulgaria, or wherever the hell they
###4992 happened to be.
###4993 Isn't that right, sir?
###4996 You're on the internet.
###4998 It's exc-- who's never been on the net before?
###5002 A couple people.
###5003 It's exciting.
###5004 This is gonna be it.
###5004 This is gonna be the only time.
###5006 I'll probably be on.
###5007 I'm not that excited.
###5009 Guys, if you like what you're enjoying so far next Thursday
###5012 night I'll be doing a show at the Ross Dress for Less on
###5015 Sunset and La Brea.
###5016 Thank you.
###5019 You got it.
###5019 I'm also a consultant there.
###5022 I consult them on how to keep the place looking like a
###5024 disaster area at all times.
###5027 I'm very hands on about it.
###5028 I'll actually move a children's story into the size
###5031 58 jeans section.
###5035 The ones with the Fat Albert painted on the side.
###5038 Yeah, that's it.
###5040 All right.
###5040 Next Friday I'll be doing a show at the kids Foot Locker
###5043 at the Glendale Galleria.
###5046 I noticed some of you not that into my stuff, but Armenian
###5049 children being fitted for size three Nikes--
###5054 that's my demographic.
###5057 All right, let's do another song.
###5058 Here we go.
###5061 This one's called "Applebee's, We Found a Way to Fuck Up
###5064 Salad." Here we go.
###5065 
###5068 Sounds good.
###5069 Give up for my DJ, Scratchitory--
###5071 Scratchitory Rape.
###5072 He's right back there on the ones and twos.
###5074 
###5078 The music sounded good.
###5079 Well, why don't we just do another one?
###5080 Here we go.
###5082 This song is about the curative powers of my wang.
###5086 It's called, "I Heal With My Steel." Here we go.
###5089 Let's do it.
###5090 Oh my god, real song.
###5092 Hands!
###5093 Side to side!
###5094 What's going to happen?
###5095 Oh, no.
###5096 There you go, yeah.
###5097 Side to side, people.
###5099 Like you're at a Jay-Z internet only show.
###5104 Keep 'em moving, keep 'em moving.
###5105 Here we go.
###5108 [MUSIC]
###5169 Cut that off, Scratchitory.
###5170 Beautiful.
###5171 Give it up for the ladies.
###5173 Oh, yeah.
###5176 Wow, that was something.
###5179 I don't know if you guys enjoyed the
###5180 lyrics to that song.
###5182 My target demographic is boys between the age of 15 and 15
###5186 and a half.
###5188 
###5190 I think we nailed it right there.
###5191 I think we did.
###5192 I think we did.
###5193 Hey, you know, I'm trying to get out of the comedy business
###5196 and I've been trying for a while now.
###5199 It's tough.
###5200 I came up with a business idea, Shreds-taurant.
###5204 Shreds-taurant, a guitar themed eatery.
###5208 All the waiters can shred on the guitar.
###5211 We give them a custom made guitar, they take
###5213 your order on guitar.
###5215 I'm still speaking English, right?
###5219 Just checking.
###5221 Just checking.
###5222 Let's make believe we're at Shreds-taurant.
###5223 Hi, ma'am.
###5224 Welcome to Shreds-taurant.
###5225 What can I get you to drink?
###5228 A beer, no problem.
###5231 [HUMS]
###5234 --a beer.
###5235 
###5238 And they send that.
###5239 It's a beautiful thing.
###5240 You know you'd eat there.
###5241 Hello, sir, what can I get you for dinner tonight, even
###5245 though I'm looking at a lady?
###5246 Hello, sir.
###5248 We're not really at Shreds-taurant.
###5249 It's OK.
###5250 It doesn't matter.
###5250 What can I get you to eat tonight?
###5253 A steak.
###5254 You got it.
###5257 [HUMS]
###5260 --a steak.
###5261 
###5263 Pick it up on this side, come on.
###5266 Laugh or the bit will continue.
###5270 There, that-- now you see how it works.
###5273 All right, let's do a song.
###5274 Here we go.
###5274 You know, before I got into the rap game I didn't have a
###5277 lot of cash.
###5278 I had to do creative things to keep the ladies interested.
###5281 This song is called, "Buy You Clothes, Do You In Them, Take
###5285 Them Back." Thank you so much.
###5291 Give it up for Scratchitory Rape on the ones and twos.
###5295 Fantastic.
###5297 Really fantastic.
###5299 Tell you a little about myself, I
###5301 recently bought a goldfish.
###5304 Turns out it's epileptic.
###5307 Weird thing is, as long as I leave it in
###5308 the bowl it's fine.
###5312 Second--
###5313 come on, corner--
###5314 second you take it out, just seizure city, flipping out all
###5318 over the place.
###5320 Fantastic.
###5321 Let's add another song.
###5323 Let's do it.
###5325 This song is called, "A Strip Club Shouldn't Smell Like
###5329 Pierogies." Spearmint Rhino Oxnard, that's right, sir.
###5336 You got it.
###5336 That's the one.
###5337 That's the place.
###5339 That's the place.
###5340 Guys, it feels good to be here, working the net.
###5345 Anybody else make money on the net?
###5348 Any eBay people?
###5351 All right, let's do a song.
###5352 
###5354 How many people here are in a relationship?
###5357 All right.
###5358 Out of those people, who here's in a relationship with
###5360 someone who likes to talk back?
###5362 
###5365 Who's in a relationship with someone who
###5366 likes to give you lip?
###5370 This song's for you.
###5371 It's a tale of revenge.
###5373 This song is called, "You Won't Sass Me Like That When I
###5377 Can Summon Wolves." Here we go.
###5382 
###5385 [MUSIC]
###5429 All right.
###5430 Let's hear some wolf noises, everybody!
###5432 
###5436 Give it up for the wolf.
###5438 All right, cut that, Scratchitory.
###5439 Hey, let's hear some wolves' noises in this corner.
###5444 There you go.
###5445 You're gonna be ready once we crank this thing up and really
###5447 show it on the net.
###5450 How are you?
###5451 All right.
###5453 Tell you a little bit more about myself, I could turn any
###5456 cat against its owner.
###5459 Something about the way I pet them.
###5461 Do you have a cat, sir?
###5463 Same lady as before.
###5464 Sir, do you have a cat?
###5467 No cat.
###5467 All right, I won't come over and prove it.
###5469 Until you get one.
###5470 Buy yourself a cat.
###5471 
###5474 Hey, guys.
###5477 I'm giving the people at home a chance to go to the men's
###5480 room, maybe get themselves something to drink.
###5484 Let's do another song.
###5485 
###5491 This song is called, "A Baby's Hand Is Cuter Than An Adult
###5494 Hand." But if you're sitting on the toilet and a hand
###5499 reaches up out of the bowl, the baby's hand is creepier.
###5503 
###5507 It's an unwieldy chorus, but I think we made it work.
###5510 Yes, we did.
###5510 Give it up for Scratchitory.
###5512 
###5517 One final song to do for you.
###5519 This one is on the new album "Douche Manouche." Pick it up
###5522 on iTunes, pick it up on YouTube, [? Jash, ?] wherever
###5524 they sell it.
###5525 Ladies and gentlemen, this song is about when
###5528 you're kind of, uh--
###5529 been doing some work in the bedroom, sir, right?
###5534 And you've been pound it in an aggressive way, and then the
###5539 girl when she gets up to walk away, she's wobbling like a
###5546 newborn baby colt.
###5547 Here we go.
###5548 This song is called,
###5549 "Newborn Baby Colt." [MUSIC]
###5608 Have a good weekend, YouTube!
###5611 Thank you so much.
###5612 Comedy Week was fantastic.
###5614 Give it up for the dancers.
###5616 I'm Dragon Boy Suede.
###5617 Take care.
###5618 Good night.
###5620 
###5624 TERRY SILK: [YAWN]
###5628 Hey.
###5629 That was easy for me.
###5630 I know how to yawn.
###5632 What about you?
###5633 How many times have you been in a situation
###5635 where you need to yawn?
###5636 Whether you're at school, playing some milk caps at
###5638 recess, or down by the local pond with your friends,
###5641 yawning is essential to acting.
###5643 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###5655 TERRY SILK: The yawn is a perfect way to sabotage other
###5659 people's game--
###5660 for example, that guy trying to get into the panties of
###5663 that girl you like.
###5664 You could roll up to him, yawn while he's trying to fuck her,
###5667 and ruin the whole thing.
###5670 Off the top of my head, probably the
###5671 best yawning scene?
###5674 "The City Just Ain't White," maybe.
###5675 It's a pretty solid one.
###5677 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###5686 TERRY SILK: Well, you've seen some pretty serious yawns from
###5689 some pretty seriously talented people, but what about if
###5692 you're not just yawning in a play, but you're on an actual
###5696 motion picture set?
###5698 Knowing when to yawn and how to yawn isn't
###5700 as easy as it looks.
###5702 Sometimes you have to wait hours in between takes, so
###5706 freezing the yawn on your face isn't always an option.
###5709 That's why I sell these.
###5711 It's a yawn sack.
###5712 Keeps your yawn good up to 24 hours and they're available on
###5715 my website.
###5717 Just freeze the yawn and use it when you need it.
###5721 Well, thanks for watching, guys.
###5723 It's been a blast.
###5724 I'll be back soon.
###5725 And like that old dude said, all the world's a stage.
###5728 So why stop acting?
###5730 It will only show people who you really are, and that'll
###5732 give them the upper hand.
###5734 
###5740 BETH HOYT: Welcome back to our big finale.
###5742 Coming up, get ready for the godfather of musical comedy,
###5746 Weird Al Yankovic.
###5748 But first, our next performer is a very funny lady.
###5752 You may know her from the classic sketch comedy show
###5754 "Mr. Show," or from a time as head writer for "The Ellen
###5757 Show," or maybe even from her time as creator of The Girls
###5761 Guitar Club.
###5762 Please give it up for Karen Kilgariff!
###5764 
###5769 KAREN KILGARIFF: Thank you.
###5771 [MUSIC]
###5900 Thank you so much.
###5902 Thank you very much.
###5903 It's an honor to be here.
###5905 This is one of my favorite clubs to play.
###5908 I like to come here on Saturdays and listen to smooth
###5911 jazz so it's amazing.
###5912 
###5915 I'm going to sing a little song about
###5916 all of us right now.
###5919 [MUSIC]
###6030 Thank you.
###6032 Thanks, I know that one's heavy.
###6034 It's a lot to take for one audience and you probably want
###6038 me to joke you out of it right now, but I'm not going to
###6040 because you're adults, OK?
###6041 
###6048 It's really nice to be here.
###6049 I--
###6049 just tell you a little bit of something about myself--
###6051 I have a really mean dad and so I'm really funny.
###6059 And this is just an example--
###6060 I'm sure he'll see this and he'd like to argue, but this
###6063 is my example.
###6064 My dad came down to visit me once and we went to get in the
###6067 car together.
###6068 We walked out into the driveway and I could smell the
###6071 lemon tree that was in my backyard.
###6073 And so I was like, ooo, it smells like lemons.
###6076 And immediately, without pause, my dad goes, what are
###6078 you, half Iroquois?
###6081 Yeah.
###6082 Drink that in.
###6085 You do know Iroquois are Indians, right?
###6087 Native Americans?
###6088 They're very attuned to nature and they can smell things from
###6090 a distance.
###6093 [MUSIC]
###6285 Thank you.
###6287 
###6290 BETH HOYT: Ladies and gentleman, tonight isn't just
###6293 about the wild and the giddy fun of musical comedy, it's
###6297 also about the hard road back to the spotlight.
###6300 Our next guest recently had a fall from grace and has only
###6304 recently began to put his life back together.
###6306 Nick Thune has fallen, and it may surprise you how he gets
###6310 back on his feet.
###6311 Please take a look.
###6312 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###6327 -So tonight's my first night back on stage since the break.
###6333 I've been scared.
###6334 I thought maybe I wasn't going to make it back on stage.
###6337 Doctor said I'm never to play guitar again.
###6339 For about six weeks.
###6343 Bo Jackson broke his hip.
###6345 He did not give up.
###6346 First game back, first pitch, first swing,
###6350 he hit a home run.
###6352 
###6356 Will I get a standing ovation on my first joke tonight?
###6360 I don't know.
###6361 That's my goal, though.
###6362 -Please put your hands together for Mr. Nick Thune!
###6366 -I can't do it.
###6367 I'm not going to do the show.
###6368 What am I even thinking?
###6369 It's an unattainable dream.
###6372 Should I jump?
###6372 Should I just break my other arm?
###6373 It's like I'm re-learning everything.
###6375 I'm re-learning how to love again.
###6378 My wife, she says, you're not the man I married.
###6380 The man I married had two arms.
###6382 I actually feel sick right now.
###6385 I don't even know who I am anymore.
###6389 A standing ovation off of one joke.
###6391 Now I know why people compare me to Bo Jackson, you know,
###6393 because that's what I'm going to do tonight.
###6395 Doctor said he would never play a
###6396 professional sport again.
###6398 Bo can't hear that.
###6399 He started working out.
###6400 I got a letter last week from an 11-year-old boy in Fort
###6403 Lauderdale who broke his wrist.
###6405 He was trying to light a fart in his bunk
###6406 bed and he fell off.
###6407 He said knowing that I'm going to go out on stage tonight,
###6411 that he wants to live.
###6412 
###6421 It sounds so stupid, but I feel like I can
###6424 almost smell his fart.
###6426 It smells good.
###6428 
###6435 BETH HOYT: OK, guys.
###6436 That's a tough, tough road for Nick.
###6437 Tell you what, it's been hard for me tonight, too.
###6440 I came in and the hairdresser said I was having a bad hair
###6442 day, but she fixed it.
###6444 So that's why I look like Heidi.
###6446 But ladies and gentleman, don't worry about it, because
###6448 please welcome Nick Thune featuring The Narcs.
###6451 
###6462 NICK THUNE: Thank you guys so much.
###6463 I know it means a lot for you to be here.
###6467 I'm honored to be in the front row of your audience.
###6469 
###6473 Could we get just a little more
###6474 laughter in these monitors?
###6477 Thank you.
###6479 
###6484 I know you guys are looking at me and you're thinking, this
###6487 guy's an athlete.
###6488 
###6490 And I love sports.
###6491 I'm not going to tell you guys I don't love sports.
###6493 I do.
###6494 But I don't play any sports.
###6495 What's my favorite sport?
###6496 Thank you.
###6497 Great question.
###6499 I'd say my favorite sport's a back flip.
###6503 It's just a guy on the streets, jumping up, no
###6505 trampoline, no diving board.
###6509 The cement.
###6510 A guy who can jump off the ground, flip his whole body
###6513 around backwards and land on his feet, any time of the day,
###6515 any street, any pair of shoes in their closet.
###6519 I'm not talking about back handsprings.
###6520 I'm not talking about cartwheels.
###6523 Nick, do you have a joke about back flips?
###6525 Another great question from the back.
###6526 No.
###6528 I'm-- right now, and knowing that there's at least hundreds
###6531 of people watching this live, for me to just to get the word
###6536 out there-- back flip awarenesss--
###6537 and if I can get that camera to zoom in on
###6539 my face right now.
###6542 Teach your children back flips.
###6543 If you're a child, learn back flips.
###6546 It's never too late, unless you're over 15.
###6551 That's it.
###6551 That's just the public service part.
###6552 If you have a stage, you've got to use it sometimes for
###6554 the right thing.
###6555 
###6557 Now that that's behind us, again, thank you guys for
###6561 being here.
###6561 And I want to tell you a little story about something
###6563 that happened to me recently at the bank.
###6565 [MUSIC]
###6576 I was at the bank, pretty crowded.
###6581 Standing in line for 90 minutes, an hour and a half.
###6583 I don't want anyone doing math out there right now.
###6587 Hour and a half in line at the bank, it's inappropriate.
###6590 It's unacceptable.
###6591 And ATMs are down outside.
###6594 All the pens aren't working.
###6596 You've all been there.
###6597 At one point a fire marshal comes and says, listen up,
###6600 we're at maximum capacity.
###6602 Nobody's coming in this bank until somebody
###6604 walks out of this bank.
###6605 I'm running it like a fucking dance club.
###6607 Excuse my language.
###6609 He walked out.
###6611 There's a line around the corner.
###6613 Lot of banking needs.
###6614 
###6617 When I finally got up to the teller, I was right.
###6620 She was a C-cup.
###6622 
###6624 She was this amazing C-cup.
###6627 I started to open up a second savings account.
###6629 I don't have money in my first savings account.
###6631 I'm just--
###6631 just trying to create conversation.
###6635 And as I'm talking to C-cup, having the time of both of our
###6637 lives, a gentleman walks into the bank.
###6643 Kitty-corner from where I'm standing, from here to the
###6644 other end, a regular guy, got a baby in his left arm, about
###6649 two months old.
###6649 It's a beautiful kid.
###6653 I'd seen maybe about 30 kids that day, it was the best
###6655 looking baby I'd seen.
###6658 In his right hand he had a handgun.
###6662 This guy jumps up on a table disrupting everybody's
###6664 business in that bank and screams out, I will shoot!
###6668 I will shoot this fucking baby in the face right now, right
###6673 now, unless somebody in this bank does a fucking back flip.
###6677 
###6683 People are freaking out.
###6684 Nobody could do a back flip.
###6685 Everybody know it.
###6686 C-cup's bouncing all over the place.
###6688 I got to calm her down.
###6690 I said, listen, don't press the red button.
###6693 Don't press-- we've seen every movie.
###6694 We know where the red button is.
###6695 It's under the table.
###6696 If you press it, the cops are coming.
###6699 This guy doesn't want any money.
###6701 He just wants to see a back flip.
###6703 There's nothing illegal about that.
###6707 Just give me two minutes, let me talk to him.
###6710 She said, will you come back for me?
###6714 And I said, yeah, now I will.
###6717 When I walked across the bank everybody got out of my way.
###6720 Why?
###6722 Because everybody wants to see a back flip, that's why.
###6725 They're amazing.
###6725 Are people worried about the baby?
###6726 Great question.
###6727 No.
###6729 No one gives a shit about that when there's a
###6731 million babies out there.
###6732 Two people know this specific one.
###6735 No, no one's worried about that baby.
###6737 
###6740 When I get to the middle of the bank a circle forms around
###6742 me like I'm in the middle of some kind of dance facility.
###6745 
###6750 I looked up at the guy with the baby and I said listen, I
###6754 didn't hear what you said.
###6755 I was talking to my lady friend back there.
###6760 He said, I'm going to shoot this baby in the face, that's
###6762 what I said, unless I see a back flip.
###6766 I said it doesn't have to be like that.
###6769 He said, I need to see one pretty bad.
###6771 
###6773 And I understood him.
###6776 I understood what he was going through.
###6780 I looked over to my right.
###6781 Cuba Gooding Ju--
###6782 Cuba Gooding Joinier--
###6783 
###6785 Cuba Gooding Junior was standing in the corner.
###6788 He had a cast on his left leg, he's got crutches under each
###6790 arm, he's injured.
###6791 We've seen Jerry Maguire.
###6793 We've seen his Wikipedia page.
###6794 We know he can do back flips.
###6796 We know he does his own stunts.
###6799 And there he is.
###6800 Rod Tidwell's injured on the sideline.
###6803 Probably the biggest game of his life, he
###6805 can't do a back flip.
###6808 It's up to me.
###6809 
###6811 So I just jumped.
###6812 I know that's step one.
###6815 I started leaning back, step two.
###6819 Next thing I know, I land on my feet.
###6820 Everybody sits down.
###6822 They stand back up.
###6824 That's a standing ovation in my country.
###6826 They let me keep the baby, I didn't see that coming.
###6829 
###6831 When I was walking out of that bank for a late lunch with
###6834 Cuba, C-cup comes bouncing up behind me.
###6839 And she says, Mr. Thune, Mr. Thune, before you go I just
###6844 want to know we caught that whole back flip on our
###6846 security cameras.
###6849 My dad works at YouTube.
###6852 I could cut a video together.
###6853 We could get it on the front page.
###6854 I mean, maybe not this week, it's Comedy Week, but
###6856 definitely next week.
###6858 And you're going to be a hero all over the world wide web.
###6862 
###6865 I just need you to sign this release form and then we'll
###6867 put the footage out there.
###6870 And I said no.
###6873 Thanks but no thanks, C-cup.
###6876 I didn't do this back flip to be a hero.
###6879 I did this back flip to be a father.
###6883 And right now the most important thing to me is I
###6885 want to be a good dad to Nick junior and I want to be a good
###6887 friend to Cuba Gooding Junior.
###6890 We named him after both of us.
###6891 He took Cuba's last name.
###6892 
###6896 I said, so you can't put it online.
###6899 And as I turned to walk away she said, but Nick, we just
###6902 caught everything you said on camera.
###6906 And I said yeah, I know.
###6909 Now you can put it on YouTube.
###6912 Thank you guys.
###6913 You're welcome.
###6916 Keep it going for The Narcs.

###6945 Hey, Linda.
###6946 Who's that cutie?
###6947 -Hey, guys.
###6947 This is my friend Little Linda and you can tell she's been
###6951 smoking a little bit of marijuana today.
###6954 Linda, marijuana is bad.
###6957 -No, girl.
###6958 It's good.
###6959 
###6962 You used to be a lot more fun when you smoked.
###6965 -That's true.
###6966 But that's what caused me to crash my Miata into that
###6969 Loehmann's.
###6970 -After your kids listen to Linda Munns they'll never
###6973 smoke marijuana, guaranteed.
###6977 Watch Linda deal with peer pressure.
###6979 -You could take a puff of this sweet green shag carpet and
###6983 have everything back that you used to have.
###6987 -Nice try, Little Linda.
###6990 I'm stronger than you, drugs.
###6993 -She's talking diet.
###6995 -Gimme, gimme.
###6997 -Linda, that's junk food.
###6998 You're going to get fat.

###7005 -You can't do a push-up.
###7007 -Yes I can, Linda.

###7013 -And real life lessons from the streets.
###7015 -[HUMS]
###7020 If you get caught smoking weed, you're going to go to
###7023 prison and then you're going to have to
###7024 stab people to survive.
###7027 -Let Linda Munns inspire your kids.
###7031 Everyone is going nuts for Little Linda and Big Linda's
###7034 dynamic.
###7035 -Why don't we go outside and get a
###7036 natural high from exercise?
###7039 -Screw that.
###7041 I just want to watch Borat and masturbate.
###7045 -And she's handing out quan.
###7047 -It's fresh quan.
###7048 You just have to let it defrost a little bit.
###7052 -I'm fucking rich.
###7054 I wrote a spec script with [? Anzizan ?]
###7056 [? sorry ?]
###7058 -Who cares?
###7060 -If you like "Book of Mormon," you'll love this.
###7064 -Man, Linda, maybe I should quit smoking
###7067 and be a better person.
###7068 
###7071 -Yeah.
###7074 If you want to book me for your next event email me at

###7120 Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Nice Peter.
###7123 
###7127 NICE PETER: Hi.
###7129 This is a song about the internet.
###7131 Kind of.
###7132 One, two--
###7134 [MUSIC]
###7256 Thank you so much.
###7257 
###7261 So this next song is very important because we have a--
###7263 we have an important guest with us.
###7264 There's a young man named Devin.
###7266 Devin, are you out there somewhere?
###7267 Hey, Devin, how's it going?
###7268 Devin, why don't you come up on stage?
###7270 So let me tell you a little bit about Devin, and uh, well,
###7273 I'll tell you a little story.
###7274 So about six months ago I realized that I had been
###7277 losing my hair for approximately 17,000 years and
###7281 I decided to just take the plunge and shave my head.
###7283 So about, it was in last May, Devin--
###7286 Devin kicked the crap out of cancer, that's what Devin did.
###7288 I never had to do that.
###7291 But, you know, part of kicking the crap out of cancer means
###7293 you've got to go through chemotherapy and get a lot of
###7296 chemicals in your body and it messes with your hair and
###7298 that's what happens.
###7299 So your hair starts falling out and being weird and it's
###7302 one of those things you just kind of take the plunge on and
###7304 you've got to do it.
###7305 So tonight we're going to shave Devin's head right here
###7307 on stage while we sing a song to him.
###7310 That's a good thing, you can clap.
###7311 Not just because, I mean--.
###7313 But the thing is, when I dealt with it was tricky.
###7317 It was hard.
###7317 I didn't even have to beat cancer in the process and it
###7319 was still emotionally difficult.
###7321 But I had my subscribers out there-- hi, if you're out
###7323 there-- and they kind of helped me through the whole
###7325 experience.
###7326 I made a video about it and shaved my head in the video
###7328 and they were all very supportive and nice.
###7329 So tonight if you're out there on the comment boards, stop
###7333 typing hateful things that are misspelled for
###7335 one second and let's--
###7336 let's all be Devlin subscribers.
###7338 We're-- we're--
###7339 I subscribe to you, Devin-- hello!
###7341 So if you could say hi to the people at home-- don't worry
###7345 about these people, they're not real-- look at
###7346 how purple they are.
###7347 No one is that purple.
###7348 Say hi to the people at home, and all the
###7350 people, say hi to Devin.
###7352 You guys can say hi to Devin, too.
###7353 I'm just kidding.
###7354 So we have my friend Sue Lions here.
###7356 Sue Lions, come out.
###7357 She's going to help us and she's going to shave his head.
###7359 So we're going to do this all together.
###7360 This is a moment.
###7361 We're going to help him take the plunge.
###7363 Any other guys out there losing their hair right here
###7365 in the audience?
###7366 Anyone?
###7367 It's kind of-- yeah, it's a pain, man.
###7369 That guy's like, yeah!
###7370 That's all right!
###7371 Tonight, we're the cool guys!
###7373 It's you and me!
###7374 Hey man, look at the hair on that dork.
###7376 Nice hair, dork.
###7378 And there's some people at home probably too.
###7380 So this is our moment.
###7381 This is our shiny-headed moment.
###7383 I see the future in your head.
###7387 Ready?
###7388 Here we go.
###7390 [MUSIC]
###7458 Oh, man, you look good right now.
###7460 [MUSIC]
###7518 Oh, man, you look good.
###7519 You kinda look like a criminal.
###7522 Like right now I wouldn't go into a bank.
###7524 [MUSIC]
###7562 Devin and his new look, ladies and gentlemen!
###7564 
###7567 Devin, will you stand with us and take a bow as a
###7570 proud new bald man?
###7571 
###7578 That was awesome.
###7579 Thank you for being here.
###7580 Thank you for being there at home.
###7581 Devin, that was awesome.
###7582 Cheers.
###7583 This is Dante.
###7584 My name's Nice Peter.
###7585 Thank you crew.
###7587 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###7603 BETH HOYT: Hi, guys.
###7604 It's me, Beth, again.
###7605 I'm here with you.
###7606 I feel like I'm the baby sitter and then the--
###7608 before the parents come out.
###7609 I babysat.
###7610 Well, I had a babysitting job when I was 10.
###7612 My first one I babysat twins--
###7614 this is just me time.
###7616 I'm talking to you about how I babysat twins.
###7618 I lost one of them--
###7618 Diane--
###7619 I never found her.
###7620 I-- the parents came home.
###7621 I said Diane is--
###7622 they're playing hide and seek.
###7624 So this is my chance to ask the world if
###7626 Diane has been found.
###7628 But I was only 10.
###7629 It's not really my fault.
###7630 Here's what I think.
###7631 How old is someone who's 10?
###7633 I don't know the difference of the like, four to 11.
###7635 Especially--
###7636 I live in New York City and I feel like kids there, like you
###7639 ask them, how old are you?
###7641 Can you show me with your fingers?
###7642 And they're like, we're going to be late for Mandarin class.
###7644 I'm like, I totally missed that one.
###7646 But guess what I didn't miss, is that our next
###7648 performer is ready.
###7649 And he is a titan in the musical comedy scene.
###7653 He stars in the IFC TV series "Comedy Bang Bang," and he has
###7656 performed with acts like Regina Spektor, [? Bergy ?]
###7658 Man, and LCD Sound System.
###7661 One of the most creative acts currently touring the world,
###7664 he's here with a word of advice to the easily confused.
