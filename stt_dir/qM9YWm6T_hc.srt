0:0:16,17 --> 0:0:17,81
TINA LARSEN: My name
is Tina Larsen.


3
0:0:17,81 --> 0:0:19,365
I'm from Bollungen, Sweden.


4
0:0:19,365 --> 0:0:20,68
And this is my rabbit, Flora.


5
0:0:20,68 --> 0:0:23,517
We're at Harrogate's
Event Center.


6
0:0:23,517 --> 0:0:26,14
Is that the name of it?


7
0:0:26,14 --> 0:0:28,21
Me and Flora is doing
rabbit show jumping.


8
0:0:28,21 --> 0:0:44,57



9
0:0:44,57 --> 0:0:46,78
She really enjoys herself
when she's jumping.


10
0:0:46,78 --> 0:0:49,82
I look at her, and I see
how fun she has.


11
0:0:49,82 --> 0:0:51,61
I don't think she care
about the trophy.


12
0:0:51,61 --> 0:0:55,2
But I think she be interested
in beating Cherie.


13
0:0:55,2 --> 0:0:56,6
MAGDALENA: This is Cherie.


14
0:0:56,6 --> 0:0:58,44
She's two and a half
years old, and she


15
0:0:58,44 --> 0:0:59,88
really loves jumping.


16
0:0:59,88 --> 0:1:1,85
ANNOUNCER: And she's off.


17
0:1:1,85 --> 0:1:3,3
Oh, she's quick.


18
0:1:3,3 --> 0:1:4,14
MAGDALENA: See's a very
happy rabbit.


19
0:1:4,14 --> 0:1:5,285
She's very fun.


20
0:1:5,285 --> 0:1:6,68
She lives in my house.


21
0:1:6,68 --> 0:1:10,37
When I'm open my fridge, she's
coming, oh, do you have


22
0:1:10,37 --> 0:1:11,55
something for me?


23
0:1:11,55 --> 0:1:15,86
She loves carrots and hay and
ordinary rabbit food.


24
0:1:15,86 --> 0:1:17,94
I don't know if she
wants to win.


25
0:1:17,94 --> 0:1:20,79
I think she think it's fun
to jump, and that's


26
0:1:20,79 --> 0:1:22,4
why she doing it.


27
0:1:22,4 --> 0:1:34,7



28
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:37,165
MAX'S TRAINER: Max's full
name is Maximilian.


29
0:1:37,165 --> 0:1:39,44
Max has been training
for a month.


30
0:1:39,44 --> 0:1:41,49
Very hyper, very enthusiastic.


31
0:1:41,49 --> 0:1:43,65
Not too sure what he's
doing all the time.


32
0:1:43,65 --> 0:1:45,21
He still really, really
tries hard.


33
0:1:45,21 --> 0:1:48,8
Max is the youngest bunny in the
competition at the moment,


34
0:1:48,8 --> 0:1:49,7
at six months old.


35
0:1:49,7 --> 0:1:51,67
And everyone loves him 'cause
his little ears go up and down


36
0:1:51,67 --> 0:1:52,92
as he jumps.


37
0:1:52,92 --> 0:2:8,537



38
0:2:8,537 --> 0:2:11,32
ANNOUNCER: Just under 10 rabbits

39
0:2:11,32 --> 0:2:12,529

40
0:2:12,529 --> 0:2:14,525
Stalwarts ready?


41
0:2:14,525 --> 0:2:15,775
Three, two, one, go.


42
0:2:15,775 --> 0:2:20,14



43
0:2:20,14 --> 0:2:20,513
Whoo!


44
0:2:20,513 --> 0:2:22,1
Let's cheer her on.


45
0:2:22,1 --> 0:2:25,503



46
0:2:25,503 --> 0:2:27,998
She's halfway through
[INAUDIBLE]


47
0:2:27,998 --> 0:2:29,248
make it to the end.


48
0:2:29,248 --> 0:2:36,1



49
0:2:36,1 --> 0:2:37,19
TINA LARSEN: The prize in
the competition this


50
0:2:37,19 --> 0:2:39,11
weekend is a trophy.


51
0:2:39,11 --> 0:2:41,32
I don't think we're going to
get it, but who knows?


52
0:2:41,32 --> 0:2:43,61
MAGDALENA: I never train
her, because I'm


53
0:2:43,61 --> 0:2:44,91
compete so often in Sweden.


54
0:2:44,91 --> 0:2:47,2
So she doesn't need
to train at home.


55
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:48,92
She trains at competitions.


56
0:2:48,92 --> 0:2:50,18
ANNOUNCER: And she's off.


57
0:2:50,18 --> 0:2:52,995
Oh, she's quick.


58
0:2:52,995 --> 0:2:54,245
[INAUDIBLE].


59
0:2:54,245 --> 0:2:56,939



60
0:2:56,939 --> 0:2:58,418
Oh, she's on a roll, come on.


61
0:2:58,418 --> 0:3:1,869
Cheer her on to win.


62
0:3:1,869 --> 0:3:4,827
And she did it.


63
0:3:4,827 --> 0:3:8,29
Well done, Cherie.


64
0:3:8,29 --> 0:3:9,47
MAGDALENA: She got the trophy.


65
0:3:9,47 --> 0:3:12,2
Today she was the winner, but
