###0 Today we've got the stand off in Ukraine, instant first dates,
###3 and here's looking at you, robot.
###5 ROBOT: Hello, Rick It has been a long time.

###14 JACOB SOBOROFF: The conflict in Ukraine
###15 took a dramatic turn over the weekend
###17 when Russian President Vladimir Putin stationed
###19 more than 16,000 troops in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula.
###22 The biggest video in Russia today is this footage right
###24 here from the ground in Sevastopol.
###26 The armed troops that you're seeing are Russian,
###28 and they're demanding that the guy
###29 on the right, the Ukrainian officer, turn over his weapons.
###32 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###34 JACOB SOBOROFF: To keep us up to date
###36 on what's a very dangerous situation,
###37 Vice News is posting dispatches from Ukraine,
###40 including this one from inside a military base in Crimea.
###43 REPORTER: So we just came over the wall of the Ukrainian Naval
###46 base.
###47 They've put these desks everywhere
###49 to make it harder for people to move through.
###51 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###58 JACOB SOBOROFF: You can see more of Simon's continuing coverage
###61 over at Vice News.
###62 And if you want to get up to speed,
###63 we put together a playlist for you after the show.
###65 Something we've been keeping our eye on.
###67 ALEX: Ever been on a date where the person
###69 doesn't realize it's a date?
###70 It's nowhere near as fun as this.
###71 Stuart Edge teamed up with musician Tiffany Albert
###74 and magician Jarek 120 to surprise strangers
###76 near the Santa Monica Pier.
###78 MAN: Oh.
###80 Man, am I starving.
###81 GUY: So, you want to get married, then?
###83 GIRL: I've kinda bee just looking for the right guy.
###85 And once he comes along, why wait, you know?
###87 ALEX: Stuart's been doing feel-good pranks
###88 like this for a year and a half.
###90 This was just posted and has almost two million views!
###92 JACOB SOBOROFF: If there's anything sweeter
###94 than a little old lady, it's a little old lady
###96 with a heart of gold.
###98 Evelyn's a determined 98-year-old woman
###100 who got her driver's license back
###101 just so she could help a friend in need.
###103 EVELYN: She said to me, Well, if they don't get another bus,
###106 they'll find another place for me to live.
###109 And she says, I just don't want to go anywhere else.
###112 I said, Joyce, I'll get you to the grocery store every week.
###115 JACOB SOBOROFF: Thanks, Evelyn, for reminding us
###117 that we can never be too old to be generous.
###119 You guys should check out some more great videos from I
###121 Like Giving.
###121 And in the meantime, I'm going to go call my Nana.
###123 NINA: Hey, guys.
###125 I'm Nina Terrero from Entertainment Weekly.
###127 You know that saying, I wouldn't date you
###128 unless you were the last person on earth?
###130 Well, meet my new obsession.
###131 A new web series that put that saying to the test.
###134 "Bad Timing" centers around a super dorky IT guy
###137 and the hot girl of his dreams, thrown together
###139 during the zombie apocalypse.
###140 
###145 GIRL: Aaaaah!
###146 GUY: Shh, there could be zombies!
###149 [KISSING SOUNDS]
###151 I can't breathe, I can't breathe!
###152 No, no, no, that's a good thing!
###153 NINA: I couldn't be more excited,
###154 because episode four officially drops today.
###156 And for more of the best series on the web,
###158 check out a special video we made just for you.
###160 The link is the description.
###162 JACOB SOBOROFF: Casablanca is widely
###163 considered one of the greatest movies ever made.
###165 But just in case the movie flopped during testing,
###168 the studio made an alternate version
###169 and it just hit the internet.
###171 That is the premise behind PistolShrimps newest video,
###173 which introduces us to Casablancbot 3,000,
###176 the love interest Rick might have had.
###178 RICK: Here's looking at you, kid.
###180 ROBOT: Syntax error.
###181 I do not understand that sentence.
###184 JACOB SOBOROFF: The two buddies behind this channel
###186 met in college.
###187 All they want to do was make absurd videos that
###188 ask questions of famous films.
###190 Like, what if everybody in The Hobbit had tattoos?
###192 HOBBIT: I really don't think you should get that butterfly
###194 tattoo on your lower back.
###196 SARUMAN: Always you must meddle.
###198 HOBBIT: It looks trashy, I think.
###200 SARUMAN: That's absurd.
###201 HOBBIT: Gandalf called it a tramp stamp.
###203 SARUMAN: He's a foolish fellow.
