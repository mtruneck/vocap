0:2:58,84 --> 0:3:13,28
Singer..Don't speak to me, Is so hard to resist
when you talk to me


10
0:3:13,28 --> 0:3:34,9
Don't reach for me
I know that you care, but when it comes up


11
0:3:34,9 --> 0:3:40,41
to loving, you are unaware
Don't you know you are a perfect drug


12
0:3:40,41 --> 0:4:26,26
Inside drives me blind
with one look from you


13
0:4:26,26 --> 0:4:30,5
Hi Dad.


14
0:4:30,5 --> 0:4:38,4
Hi son, you're here.
I told you I will be here.


15
0:4:38,4 --> 0:4:53,9
Is that the same woman that I saw at 
our house last night?


16
0:4:53,9 --> 0:4:42,94
Yes, That's her. 


17
0:4:42,94 --> 0:4:59,38
She thinks she's in love with me.


18
0:4:59,38 --> 0:5:5,4
Don't you know you are the perfect drug.


19
0:5:5,4 --> 0:5:25,39
Are you serious? Isn't she to young for you
dad?


20
0:5:25,39 --> 0:5:27,74
That's enough Ivan. I did not asked you here
for that.


21
0:5:27,74 --> 0:5:33,28
And what that would be?
If you stop with the sarcasm, we can get to


22
0:5:33,28 --> 0:5:35,97
the point.
there are two things I need you to do for


23
0:5:35,97 --> 0:5:40,14
me.
What is it?


24
0:5:40,14 --> 0:5:46,69
Ivan, I don't know what got into you in the
last few months. You are totally different


25
0:5:46,69 --> 0:5:51,5
person, and is not good.
I have this friend and i want you to go talk


26
0:5:51,5 --> 0:5:57,68
with her. Maybe she can help.
You are sending me to a shrink?


27
0:5:57,68 --> 0:6:2,84
She is not a shrink, she is a very educated
woman. She is the best pshichologist in Moscow.


28
0:6:2,84 --> 0:6:6,58
She is very good.
But I don't have any problems. Why would I


29
0:6:6,58 --> 0:6:11,92
need a shrink?
Oh yes you do. I need you to stay focused.


30
0:6:11,92 --> 0:6:17,3
Not to do things that are below your station.
Soon you will be my replacement.


31
0:6:17,3 --> 0:6:25,27
You need to act like it.
Fine I will go and see your highly recommended


32
0:6:25,27 --> 0:6:40,58
shrink. It won't change anything. 
What else do you want from me?


33
0:6:40,58 --> 0:7:4,14
I won't do it!
Yes you are!


34
0:7:4,14 --> 0:7:9,75
(applause)
Hi honey. What is wrong? You look worried.


35
0:7:9,75 --> 0:7:16,18
It is Ivan. He is changing by the minute.
I don't know what to do about it. 


36
0:7:16,18 --> 0:7:22,71
He does not seem like he cares.
I'm worried about him.


37
0:7:22,71 --> 0:7:26,45
Oh, I wish I could help. 
He is a story


38
0:7:26,45 --> 0:7:30,53
Enough with my words. Tell me how have you
been doing?


39
0:7:30,53 --> 0:7:36,68
Oh, I don't have enough words to tell you.
It's 


40
0:7:36,68 --> 0:7:39,6
I'm so grateful for everything that you did
for me Alex. It is also wonderful. 


41
0:7:39,6 --> 0:7:51,5
I didn't even dream that one day I will be
sitting in one of the most expensive restaurants.


42
0:7:51,5 --> 0:7:54,58
My pleasure.
Give my beautiful lady a drink.


43
0:7:54,58 --> 0:8:0,46
Yes Sir, What can I get you madam?
Same thing like Alex is having.


44
0:8:0,46 --> 0:8:0,95
Yes madam, I'll get it right away.
Thank You.


45
0:8:0,95 --> 0:8:13,9
You are welcome.


46
0:8:13,9 --> 0:8:18,26
Hi Ivan. Have a sit. How are you doing today?
Good. Thank You.


47
0:8:18,26 --> 0:8:23,77
Ivan, I worked with a lot of people that worked
with your father. 


48
0:8:23,77 --> 0:8:31,11
They all have problems. They all can't sleep
and they come to me because they have problems.


49
0:8:31,11 --> 0:8:35,649
Whatever I have said in this room, Whatever
they said in this room, stays in this room.


50
0:8:35,649 --> 0:8:39,18
So don't be afraid to open up and tell me
what is bothering you.


51
0:8:39,18 --> 0:8:44,82
Oh, I'm not afraid.
Ivan. Your father told me you are believing


52
0:8:44,82 --> 0:8:50,279
in God and you talk to God? Do you want to
tell me a little bit about it?


53
0:8:50,279 --> 0:8:55,97
What's so hard to understand that i believe
in God. What's wrong with you people?


54
0:8:55,97 --> 0:9:5,7
Are you feeling angry Ivan?
No. I'm not angry.


55
0:9:5,7 --> 0:9:11,32
Do you want to talk about your feelings?
Oh, do you want to know how I feel? I feel


56
0:9:11,32 --> 0:9:16,3
like I want to run. I want to run away and
never come back.


57
0:9:16,3 --> 0:9:22,2
Ivan. You have everything. Everything that
a kid can wish for.


58
0:9:22,2 --> 0:9:27,78
Maybe you are right. I have everything, except
that I don't have love. My father is killing


59
0:9:27,78 --> 0:9:35,42
people, you know that, and you feel so calm.
Ivan, just .. Let's make appointment for next


60
0:9:35,42 --> 0:9:41,43
week.
I won't see you next week.


61
0:9:41,43 --> 0:9:54,67
I'm moving to United States. I want to start
a new life.


62
0:9:54,67 --> 0:9:58,67
Hey, hey Ivan
Here is the book you are looking for man.


63
0:9:58,67 --> 0:10:8,81
Thank you Sergei.
You are a good friend Sergei.


64
0:10:8,81 --> 0:10:10,68
Of course man.
Friends forever.


65
0:10:10,68 --> 0:10:13,71
Forever man.
We know each other since we were kids man.


66
0:10:13,71 --> 0:10:19,86
Yeah, that's why I have to tell you something.
Something important.


67
0:10:19,86 --> 0:10:26,73
Tell me what.
I'm tired of this Mafia. Is not for me.


68
0:10:26,73 --> 0:10:29,61
So what are you gonna do? How are you gone
get out of this?


69
0:10:29,61 --> 0:10:36,74
I'm moving to United States.
Are you crazy? Your father won't let you do


70
0:10:36,74 --> 0:10:41,4
this in a million years.
If he is not gonna allow me, I'm just gonna


71
0:10:41,4 --> 0:10:46,2
run.
I wonder if you can pull this off. You know,


72
0:10:46,2 --> 0:10:50,82
I was wondering about the same thing too.
Come with me then. Let's go together to America.


73
0:10:50,82 --> 0:10:58,56
That would be so great. Move to America. Get
a new place. Florida maybe!


74
0:10:58,56 --> 0:11:1,17
I have something better!
What?


75
0:11:1,17 --> 0:11:3,91
Hollywood.
Wow, Sunny California!


76
0:11:3,91 --> 0:11:10,31
maybe we can see some movie stars there too.
I have friends there, we can stay at Jacob's


77
0:11:10,31 --> 0:11:12,8
house.
Who is Jacob?


78
0:11:12,8 --> 0:11:16,45
He is a kid I have met online. He is a good
guy.


79
0:11:16,45 --> 0:11:24,48
He invited me over at his house.
You know what man? Let's do it.


80
0:11:24,48 --> 0:11:27,22
Let's do it.


81
0:11:27,22 --> 0:11:33,41
I asked you to take care of that situation
for you and you let me down.


82
0:11:33,41 --> 0:11:39,87
I'm not like you. I can't just pull the trigger
and kill somebody for $5000, I'm not going


83
0:11:39,87 --> 0:11:44,47
to do it.
I built up this whole business, my whole life


84
0:11:44,47 --> 0:11:51,71
for you. For you!
And you are just gonna live me like this?


85
0:11:51,71 --> 0:11:55,17
I did not ask for. Because of your business,
mom is dead. Died! 


86
0:11:55,17 --> 0:12:1,76
I don't have a mom. I just have a dad who's
too busy killing people, not hug his son or


87
0:12:1,76 --> 0:12:7,779
love his family.
I'm sick of this. I don't want to do this.


88
0:12:7,779 --> 0:12:11,17
Why are you bringing up this old stuff. This
is got nothing to do with anything.


89
0:12:11,17 --> 0:12:16,4
I sent you to the best schools in Moscow.
I gave you the best education you could possibly


90
0:12:16,4 --> 0:12:18,279
get. 
You've done everything you wanted. You've


91
0:12:18,279 --> 0:12:23,41
done everything you wanted to to.
All I asked is to help me out in a situation


92
0:12:23,41 --> 0:12:29,21
but you wouldn't even do that.
Is not the help, is just to shoot somebody,


93
0:12:29,21 --> 0:12:35,13
come on. I know you do this for whole your
life, I just can't go and shoot somebody.


94
0:12:35,13 --> 0:12:39,57
Is just crazy.
You know two years ago I found God. I'm going


95
0:12:39,57 --> 0:12:43,339
every Sunday to Church. 
I'm praying. I'm happy. Why do you want me


96
0:12:43,339 --> 0:12:48,26
to kill somebody. This is crazy. You use keep
doing your thing if you think is right.


97
0:12:48,26 --> 0:12:53,62
I'm just gonna.. just do your business
I'm not gonna do this. I'm gonna stay away


98
0:12:53,62 --> 0:12:59,2
from this.
This business is taking you to Los Angeles.


99
0:12:59,2 --> 0:13:3,88
From where do you think you get all the money
from? Do you think it just grows on trees?


100
0:13:3,88 --> 0:13:13,4
I did not ask for this. I did not ask for
you, I did not ask for mom, I'm your son and


101
0:13:13,4 --> 0:13:15,49
..
is just crazy, it just happened this. My mother


102
0:13:15,49 --> 0:13:19,86
died because of this shit and rest of the
stuff, you know?


103
0:13:19,86 --> 0:13:24,2
I can't deal with this, you know? Mom told
me, I never told you this, but Mom told me


104
0:13:24,2 --> 0:13:27,25
before when I was a kid.
I still remember when I was 10 years old.


105
0:13:27,25 --> 0:13:29,67
She told me, she was praying with me one night
and she told me.


106
0:13:29,67 --> 0:13:33,77
"I hope you are not gonna grow up like your
Dad." I'm not gonna be like you.


107
0:13:33,77 --> 0:13:39,6
I'll be something different like a Doctor
or a Lawyer. Something that people used to


108
0:13:39,6 --> 0:13:46,35
look up to and say:
"That's a good man, he is helping people.


109
0:13:46,35 --> 0:13:59,44
Not shooting people." Unbelievable.
This business is our life. Ok? You were groomed


110
0:13:59,44 --> 0:14:4,399
to take over the family business.
I don't have anybody else I can come on. I


111
0:14:4,399 --> 0:14:10,29
can't count on my brother. i don't trust him
too. He is doing some crazy stuff behind your


112
0:14:10,29 --> 0:14:12,68
back. 
I see him with different people from different


113
0:14:12,68 --> 0:14:19,649
groups of the town. Your competitors in this
thing. i don't like him too.


114
0:14:19,649 --> 0:14:24,82
I don't like what you guys do, but I'm not
gonna mix in this and not gonna tell you what


115
0:14:24,82 --> 0:14:27,899
to do.
Is just You know who to trust, just don't


116
0:14:27,899 --> 0:14:33,37
count on me. I'm not gonna do it.
I can not trust my brother. You are the only


117
0:14:33,37 --> 0:14:41,64
one I can trust. This is when i need you most.
I ned you now. I don't need you in Los Angeles.


118
0:14:41,64 --> 0:14:48,14
I'm not gonna do it Dad, If you want to pull
the gun and shoot me right here. I'm not gonna


119
0:14:48,14 --> 0:14:53,69
do it.
Bible and God said DON"T KILL. I'm not gonna


120
0:14:53,69 --> 0:15:2,11
kill anybody for money. Is not good.
My brother, he is a scumbag. Is nobody I can


121
0:15:2,11 --> 0:15:6,72
trust but you. I need you watching my back.
Do you know how many times a day somebody


122
0:15:6,72 --> 0:15:12,44
tries to kill me?
Dad, that's why i told you to live this business


123
0:15:12,44 --> 0:15:19,5
and start something else, retire and give
up this.


124
0:15:19,5 --> 0:15:24,68
He has been with you 15 years in this business.
Twenty, I don't even know.


125
0:15:24,68 --> 0:15:29,8
He doesn't have a problem to shoot somebody.
You need that kind of people. You don't need


126
0:15:29,8 --> 0:15:36,52
somebody like me who can't even shoot a guy.
Retire! You don't just retire. You don't just


127
0:15:36,52 --> 0:15:43,22
get out of this, just say "I'm done and that's
it." It doesn't work like that.


128
0:15:43,22 --> 0:15:47,36
That's why I don't want to jump in. Because
if I jump in, there is no way out. 


129
0:15:47,36 --> 0:15:53,11
I want normal family, I want normal life.
I want to have wife, children, drive safe.


130
0:15:53,11 --> 0:15:57,97
Not thinking somebody is going to kill me.
But you are already in. You can't get out.


131
0:15:57,97 --> 0:16:4,32
You can't back out now. You are past that
point of no return. This is it. Ivan!


132
0:16:4,32 --> 0:16:11,0
This is it! This is the life. This is what
you were born into. 


133
0:16:11,0 --> 0:16:15,279
This is what i groomed you for all these years.


134
0:16:15,279 --> 0:16:22,0
You can do this. I need you. Please. Tell
me you will stay.


135
0:16:22,0 --> 0:16:30,649
Dad. I'm just gonna run away from Russia,
just go somewhere and start a new life.


136
0:16:30,649 --> 0:16:38,81
Hopefully nobody is gonna find me somewhere
and I'm gonna be happy and not hear again


137
0:16:38,81 --> 0:16:49,6
about this Mafia thing.
Stop the car. I'l walk from here.


138
0:16:49,6 --> 0:17:9,409
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure. I'll call you sometimes.


139
0:17:9,409 --> 0:17:22,199
Tom, LA. Tom, how are you? Listen.
My son is flying to LA tomorrow.


140
0:17:22,199 --> 0:17:28,389
Can you look after him? Thank you. 


141
0:17:28,389 --> 0:17:53,159
I knew I can count on you.


142
0:17:53,159 --> 0:18:27,59
Sergei! Sergei 
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO AMERICA


143
0:18:27,59 --> 0:18:38,379
Told you not to bother me. I need some time alone.
I know Sir. It's your brother. 


144
0:18:38,379 --> 0:18:47,84
He is here to see you.
What do you want Demitry? I'm not exactly


145
0:18:47,84 --> 0:18:54,83
in the mood to talk with you right now.
Would you like something?


146
0:18:54,83 --> 0:19:2,869
Ivan plane just took off.
I know that. Is there anything else?


147
0:19:2,869 --> 0:19:4,379
Actually no. How could you?!
What?


148
0:19:4,379 --> 0:19:11,59
Do you want Ivan to take over your place?
He is my son. What did you expect?


149
0:19:11,59 --> 0:19:15,419
I work for you for over 15 years and this
is how you repay?


150
0:19:15,419 --> 0:19:19,84
Oh, please. You really didn't expect me to
give you my empire, did you?


151
0:19:19,84 --> 0:19:24,11
But Ivan he couldn't even kill a fly. Why
do you expect him to take over your business?


152
0:19:24,11 --> 0:19:28,94
Huh? He is a coward. Don't you see that?
Don't talk about my son like that, or I'll


153
0:19:28,94 --> 0:19:32,82
kill you!
That's why I'm here. To take what was mine


154
0:19:32,82 --> 0:19:37,649
long time ago.
This!


155
0:19:37,649 --> 0:19:54,919
-screaming-


156
0:19:54,919 --> 0:20:2,919
Don't be stupid guys. I'm in charge here now.


157
0:20:2,919 --> 0:20:5,869
Hey, do you want to go to the airport?
Why, what's at the airport?


158
0:20:5,869 --> 0:20:10,619
Do you remember the russian guy I've met,
like, two months ago on the internet?


159
0:20:10,619 --> 0:20:14,8
Yeah, what about him?
He is coming into town.


160
0:20:14,8 --> 0:20:21,409
What is your mom going to say about this?
Hey, she is cool. She said he can move with us.


161
0:20:21,409 --> 0:20:24,71
Dog, are you coming or what?


162
0:20:24,71 --> 0:21:10,239
Ok, allright.
Let's go.


163
0:21:10,239 --> 0:21:17,659
So where is this russian friend of yours anyway?
Just be cool. He will be here any minute.


164
0:21:17,659 --> 0:21:19,6
Alright?
So we are just gonna stand here and wait all

I don't have a luggage.
A russian with no luggage.


171
0:21:58,389 --> 0:22:2,35
What are the chances of that. 
Hold on second. I see somebody who


172
0:22:2,35 --> 0:22:10,57
Hello Ivan, my name is Tom. Your father called
me and ask me to help you out for a few days.


173
0:22:10,57 --> 0:22:14,35
I'm sorry I couldn't get you 
a car in such short notice.


174
0:22:14,35 --> 0:22:16,35
Here are the keys to my car. 
You can use it for a few days.


175
0:22:16,35 --> 0:22:20,179
There are enough money in
the trunk to cover all the expenses. 


176
0:22:20,179 --> 0:22:24,71
So who is that guy?

0:24:35,499 --> 0:24:40,489

0:24:42,499 --> 0:24:49,129
Well, right now is cold man, it's i think
20 degrees below zero.


192
0:24:49,129 --> 0:24:51,879
But because is January man. Same thing like

196
0:25:16,34 --> 0:25:26,229
to come here. I'll handle this. I want to
be a part of the family. I can handle this.


197
0:25:26,229 --> 0:25:36,149
We don't know where Ivan is yet.
Do you have a sister or something?


198
0:25:36,149 --> 0:25:42,6
No man, I'm the only son. My mom died when
I was ten. My dad has his own crazy business


199
0:25:42,6 --> 0:25:47,97
and I'm not into supporting so I kinda
of walked away.


200
0:25:47,97 --> 0:25:56,109
I did not know your mother died.
Yeah, she died man. I was ten years old. 


201
0:25:56,109 --> 0:26:3,299
That sucks.
But we are working .. We have a lead You


202
0:26:3,299 --> 0:26:11,659
don't need to come out here Sir,  I understand.
I unders.. I'll


203
0:26:11,659 --> 0:26:18,39
That's why I'm kid of jealous man. You have
a good mom and is cool.


204
0:26:18,39 --> 0:26:19,32
You don't have to be jealous! There is enough
of me to go around.


205
0:26:19,32 --> 0:26:23,549
Thank you. Yeah, she is like the neighborhood
mom. All my friends come one, hang out, kick


206
0:26:23,549 --> 0:26:28,229
it.
It's cool. Thank you for letting him.. let


207
0:26:28,229 --> 0:26:33,919
me stay here with you guys. I appreciate that.
I know I met you just for two months online


208
0:26:33,919 --> 0:26:42,139
and it was really col.
i was basically having a bad day, and i went


209
0:26:42,139 --> 0:26:50,59
online two months ago and I've met Jacob.
We had a short online conversation, he told


210
0:26:50,59 --> 0:26:56,109
me about Hollywood, LA. 
It's just I had to run away from all this


211
0:26:56,109 --> 0:27:2,19
and start a new life.
I admire you for your courage.


212
0:27:2,19 --> 0:27:8,169
Thank You. 
I did not have a clue. I'd probably, no


213
0:27:8,169 --> 0:27:12,989
I would've not had the courage to come so
far by myself.


214
0:27:12,989 --> 0:27:19,909
But, you know.
I'll pick you up at the airpot Sir.  Until


215
0:27:19,909 --> 0:27:32,269
you get here I'll. Hello?
I couldn't imagine, like, leaving the United


216
0:27:32,269 --> 0:27:38,169
States to go live in another country, it's
just like, near, No  You now me like 


217
0:27:38,169 --> 0:27:44,289
not knowing what the area is, or  is kind
of scary. 


218
0:27:44,289 --> 0:27:49,97
Yeah, I took english in school so, I know
a little bit. I speak little bit english.


219
0:27:49,97 --> 0:27:55,489
Is my first day in LA, in United States, It's
cool.


220
0:27:55,489 --> 0:28:1,429
I'm glad that I understand you guys. If I
would start speaking Russian, nobody would


221
0:28:1,429 --> 0:28:4,39
probably understand anything. 
In school do you have to learn english? Or


222
0:28:4,39 --> 0:28:11,82
is it like, you can take other language like
Spanish or something like that?


223
0:28:11,82 --> 0:28:16,46
Same thing.
You have a choice, German, French or English.


224
0:28:16,46 --> 0:28:26,669
I took English so, I just took English.
Did they encourage you to select English?


225
0:28:26,669 --> 0:28:30,34
Yeah, because English is first language in
the world. 


226
0:28:30,34 --> 0:28:38,359
I was in a private school. My father has a
lot of money and connections. so I was


227
0:28:38,359 --> 0:28:52,19
I just jot tied of that. I had the best education
basically. Is not about that. After my mom


228
0:28:52,19 --> 0:28:57,33
died, I missed love.
It was not enough love from my dad, he was


229
0:28:57,33 --> 0:29:5,299
always busy and that kind of stuff, so.
He got you that fat car?


230
0:29:5,299 --> 0:29:9,779
That's my uncles.
That's actually Tom's car. He knows my father.


231
0:29:9,779 --> 0:29:11,619
They used to do a lot of business together,


232
0:29:11,619 --> 0:29:17,859
so. He is kind of, kind of like my dad so
I don't want anything from them 


233
0:29:17,859 --> 0:29:24,609
But for first days, couple days, I'll take
their help, but then I just wanna be independent.


234
0:29:24,609 --> 0:29:26,69
I don't want anything of this, I just run


235
0:29:26,69 --> 0:29:31,499
away from this but is keep following me.
Because of my dad's connection even in this


236
0:29:31,499 --> 0:29:35,409
country, so is good.
Well, as long as you are in my household,


237
0:29:35,409 --> 0:29:40,95
you've got a cool mom.
Thank You.


238
0:29:40,95 --> 0:29:51,32
I told you she was cool.
Let me show you your room.


239
0:29:51,32 --> 0:29:59,83

I see something special in your too.
Good, I like that.


259
0:34:37,27 --> 0:34:47,96
So
What did you use to do in Paris?


260
0:34:47,96 --> 0:34:53,19
I used to model.
For how long have you been in LA?


261
0:34:53,19 --> 0:34:56,369
Six months.
What brought you to LA?


262
0:34:56,369 --> 0:35:1,849
I just wanted to turn the page. Start a new
life.


263
0:35:1,849 --> 0:35:9,2
That's funny, because that is why I came to
LA.


264
0:35:9,2 --> 0:38:31,99
That's good.


265
0:38:31,99 --> 0:38:34,24
Why do you think I'm so special?
I don't know, I feel like you are special,


266
0:38:34,24 --> 0:38:38,869

0:38:38,869 --> 0:38:43,329
Thank You.

268
0:38:43,329 --> 0:38:47,69
Me too.

269
0:38:47,69 --> 0:38:50,369
I had a good day.
Thank You. Me too. I'm happy that you enjoyed.


270
0:38:50,369 --> 0:39:5,93
In long time I did not had such a good day.
Me too.


271
0:39:5,93 --> 0:39:27,93
I enjoy you. Thank You. That means a lot to
me. 


272
0:39:27,93 --> 0:39:42,119
Oh, My, God 


273
0:39:42,119 --> 0:39:45,65
Hey, it is the guy from the airport.


274
0:39:45,65 --> 0:39:51,89
Hey guys, where is Ivan at? He is out on a
date or something.


275
0:39:51,89 --> 0:39:54,23
Oh shit!
What's going on?


276
0:39:54,23 --> 0:39:57,39
His uncle killed his father so he can take
over the family business.


277
0:39:57,39 --> 0:40:1,69
Now he wants Ivan dead too.
What's the family business?


278
0:40:1,69 --> 0:40:5,829
He never mentioned it to you? 
His father is the head of the Russian Mob.


279
0:40:5,829 --> 0:40:15,89
What?! He never mentioned the Mafia!
I knew there was something fishy about him.


280
0:40:15,89 --> 0:40:20,16
He did not say anything to me. Did he say
anything to you?


281
0:40:20,16 --> 0:40:26,4
No, he didn't.
Look, we do not have time for this. We need


282
0:40:26,4 --> 0:40:29,25
to find Ivan and we need to find him now.
He is in trouble.


283
0:40:29,25 --> 0:40:31,63
What kind of trouble. I don't understand.
What is going on?


284
0:40:31,63 --> 0:40:38,39
Let's find Ivan, let's find him now.
What are you talking Russian Mafia? Man, I


285
0:40:38,39 --> 0:40:41,609
just want to play basketball. Don't get me
involved in this crap.


286
0:40:41,609 --> 0:40:46,47
I'm not getting you involved.
I made a promise to his father a while back


287
0:40:46,47 --> 0:40:48,73
I'll watch for him, and that's what I'm gonna
do.


288
0:40:48,73 --> 0:40:52,769
Well, I don't know how that involves me, so
find Ivan yourself.


289
0:40:52,769 --> 0:40:55,69
Look, Ivan's problem can become your problem,
real quick.


290
0:40:55,69 --> 0:41:4,39
We need to really help him now. Don't be like
this. He is our friend.


291
0:41:4,39 --> 0:41:19,539
The next time we see Ivan, he could be dead.
We need to find him now. 


292
0:41:19,539 --> 0:41:29,539
Get out of here. I'll keep them busy!


293
0:41:29,539 --> 0:41:54,96
Call the police!


294
0:41:54,96 --> 0:42:40,92
Looking for me? 
Get your ass up!


295
0:42:40,92 --> 0:42:45,46
Demitry, welcome to the States!
Don't screw around. This guy is crazy. 


296
0:42:45,46 --> 0:43:35,65
He is here to kill his nephew.
Do you think he's got a problem killing you?


297
0:43:35,65 --> 0:43:39,329
I've made arrangements to get your clothes
and your choice of transportation. 


298
0:43:39,329 --> 0:43:43,96
So, what does it seem to be the problem here?
Why do I have to come out here 


299
0:43:43,96 --> 0:43:54,619
and take care of things myself?
Tony, get in the car! 


300
0:43:54,619 --> 0:44:0,799
Not in the front sit. Get in the back!
Where the hell do you find these guys?


301
0:44:0,799 --> 0:44:6,72
What's wrong with you?
He is too dumb to pay him it any less. Yes...


302
0:44:6,72 --> 0:44:16,13
So what's your plan?
My plan is  Well first of all I want to


303
0:44:16,13 --> 0:44:19,359
explain myself to you. 
We had a problem catching Ivan because Tom


304
0:44:19,359 --> 0:44:21,529
was protecting him.
By who?


305
0:44:21,529 --> 0:44:23,76
Tom.
I understand that you are upset 


306
0:44:23,76 --> 0:44:26,92
but we took care of Tom. 
Tom was protecting them, 


307
0:44:26,92 --> 0:44:29,92
hiding them all over the city.
We have a guy in the back right here, that


308
0:44:29,92 --> 0:44:34,38
might know where Ivan might be. 
But he is not giving us the information. 


309
0:44:34,38 --> 0:44:37,559
He is not being friendly. 
Let's tell him we don't have to friendly either


310
0:44:37,559 --> 0:44:44,67
and let's get some information out of him.
All right. Let's go.


311
0:44:44,67 --> 0:44:52,569
Have this stab on side.
Tony, give me your gun.


312
0:44:52,569 --> 0:45:8,16
My gun?
Yes, your gun.


313
0:45:8,16 --> 0:47:25,49
You are ready.
Please, today. Let's go.


314
0:47:25,49 --> 0:47:29,7
By all means you came so far. 


315
0:47:29,7 --> 0:47:51,299
Show me how the russians do it.


316
0:47:51,299 --> 0:47:55,289
Wakey, wakee. Do you know who we are.
Do you know what we're doing here.


317
0:47:55,289 --> 0:48:0,809
Do you remember me?
I guess. 


318
0:48:0,809 --> 0:48:4,9
Listen to me. We are not playing around.
Listen to him!


319
0:48:4,9 --> 0:48:10,19
Listen to me. We're here about your friend
Ivan.


320
0:48:10,19 --> 0:48:12,97
Where is he?
I don't know!


321
0:48:12,97 --> 0:48:22,119
You don't know?
Your friend Ivan. Where is he.


322
0:48:22,119 --> 0:48:29,319
We saw you plying basketball with him 
where is he?


323
0:48:29,319 --> 0:48:39,23
I don't know.
Tony. One more time. 


324
0:48:39,23 --> 0:48:46,99
Do you see this gun at your throat? The last
thing you are going to hear 


325
0:48:46,99 --> 0:48:51,519

Your friend Ivan, you know what I'm talking about! 


326
0:48:51,519 --> 0:48:57,89
Do you like the air? Do you like the air to
clean up your brain? Do you hear me know?


327
0:48:57,89 --> 0:49:7,549
A minute ago you did not know what is all
about, now you know. Look at that man right there. 


328
0:49:7,549 --> 0:49:13,49
Do you see him? See him? He came over
all the way from Russia to find you.


329
0:49:13,49 --> 0:49:16,73
Now listen, I've seen you in the neighborhood
and I don't want to hurt you


330
0:49:16,73 --> 0:49:19,9
Are you trying to say something to me? 
I don't.


331
0:49:19,9 --> 0:49:23,47
You don't what?
Point the gun?


332
0:49:23,47 --> 0:49:28,759
Look at Him! See that man right there.

333
0:49:28,759 --> 0:49:33,71
He's from Moscow, he came here to find you,
but you want to talk with me.


334
0:49:33,71 --> 0:49:33,92
Look at me. You're not gonna talk are you?
I don't know. 


335
0:49:33,92 --> 0:49:50,119
let me introduce you to my friend, Demitry.
Demitry!


336
0:49:50,119 --> 0:49:54,109
I tried to save you kid but you don't want
to listen.


337
0:49:54,109 --> 0:50:3,48
Just let me go.


338
0:50:3,48 --> 0:50:9,48
So you're gonna tell us where Ivan is? 


339
0:50:9,48 --> 0:50:12,24
What's gonna be kid?
Do you want to get out of here alive?


340
0:50:12,24 --> 0:50:25,39
He's staying at Jacob's, he's staying at Jacob's!
At Jacob's?


341
0:50:25,39 --> 0:50:29,94
Yes. 
Oh, why you just didn't say so. 


342
0:50:29,94 --> 0:50:34,94
So he's at jacob's huh?


343
0:50:34,94 --> 0:50:39,16
Nice knowing you kid.


344
0:50:39,16 --> 0:50:52,759
Wait, I thought you are going to let me go!


345
0:50:52,759 --> 0:55:29,2
So do you know where to find this Jacob kid, right?


346
0:55:29,2 --> 0:51:4,869
Jacob, jacob Hey Tony, jacob kid, the black kid. 
The one you were chasing. The one he got away?


347
0:51:4,869 --> 0:51:8,92
Yeah. Where is he?
Well, we have to find him.


348
0:51:8,92 --> 0:51:12,299
Find him! I gave you the responsibility of
the address book. Where is he?


349
0:51:12,299 --> 0:51:15,22

It is very important as soon as you know where


350
0:51:15,22 --> 0:51:19,67
Ivan is, I need to take care of it. 
This is personal. Right?


351
0:51:19,67 --> 0:51:22,329
All right man.
Go on the phone, call who you need. 


352
0:51:22,329 --> 0:51:33,69
We need to find that kid right now.


353
0:51:33,69 --> 0:51:36,469
Listen, when we spoke on the phone last fall


354
0:51:36,469 --> 0:51:40,369
you were suppose to be the man in LA. Take
care of everything. Every time you have a


355
0:51:40,369 --> 0:51:43,69
problem, I can't come from Moscow all the
way here to make sure it is all OK. 


356
0:51:43,69 --> 0:51:50,819
You need to be in charge of that. 
Alright, I'll take care of it. 


357
0:51:50,819 --> 0:51:54,74
I won't let you down.
I promised you, that you are going to have


358
0:51:54,74 --> 0:52:2,25
a shot at it and I'm gonna keep my word.
But every time you have a little problem,


359
0:52:2,25 --> 0:52:11,25
you need to be the man who solves these things
out.


360
0:52:11,25 --> 0:53:19,49
OK. Thank You.
Tony. Let's go!


361
0:53:19,49 --> 0:53:24,16
I missed you so much.
Thank you for coming.


362
0:53:24,16 --> 0:53:33,809
You did not change yet. What happened.
No, I did not change yet. I didn't go home.


363
0:53:33,809 --> 0:53:39,329
Listen, I know we didn't know each other that
long but i fell in love with you.


364
0:53:39,329 --> 0:53:45,42
I feel like you are very special person. I'm
very happy that I've met you. 


365
0:53:45,42 --> 0:53:51,609
Last night I was thinking about you.
How beautiful you are, how good you smell


366
0:53:51,609 --> 0:54:2,67
and beautiful lips and eyes and.. perfect,
you are perfect. I fell in love with you and


367
0:54:2,67 --> 0:54:14,74
i have something for you.
I hope this is not gonna be a shock, but,


368
0:54:14,74 --> 0:54:17,809
would you marry me?
Wow! This is a big surprise. I don't know


369
0:54:17,809 --> 0:54:26,19
what to say, I mean, I love you too but
I barely met you.


370
0:54:26,19 --> 0:54:29,789
I'll take that as a yes.
This is a beautiful ring.


371
0:54:29,789 --> 0:54:45,21
It is a big surprise.
I love you.


372
0:54:45,21 --> 0:55:6,22
I love you too.
Trying to run from me? I got you now Jacob!


373
0:55:6,22 --> 0:55:10,829
Nice work!
What's wrong man? 


374
0:55:10,829 --> 0:55:15,99
What were my instructions?  What were
my instructions?! 


375
0:55:15,99 --> 0:55:18,49
We were suppose to get information and shoot
his ass.


376
0:55:18,49 --> 0:55:21,99
What information did you get?
He wasn't gonna talk anyways.


377
0:55:21,99 --> 0:55:29,549
He never had a chance because you 
put a bullet in his brain 


378
0:55:29,549 --> 0:55:32,41
before he had a chance to say anything!
Just tell him something else happened alright.


379
0:55:32,41 --> 0:55:37,29
We'll tell him that he tried something so
we had to put a bullet in his ass. It's done.


380
0:55:37,29 --> 0:55:42,119
We can't go back. It's over.
You gonna want me to tell Demitry that? You


381
0:55:42,119 --> 0:55:49,15
are going to tell him.
Fine. If I'll have to, I'll tell him


382
0:55:49,15 --> 0:55:54,68
It is just It takes like  wow 
I was expecting to come here, I was alone,


383
0:55:54,68 --> 0:56:1,71
no friends and suddenly I've met you. 
You are a great man and you know, I feel for


384
0:56:1,71 --> 0:56:2,49
you and it's happy. It's something amazing
what happened to me.


385
0:56:2,49 --> 0:56:7,809
I think, I think we are going to be very happy
family. We can have a good time together.


386
0:56:7,809 --> 0:56:15,779
I think so too. I'm so happy. Where do you
think we will live?


387
0:56:15,779 --> 0:56:22,319
I don't know. We will talk. As long as we
are happy, that's important.


388
0:56:22,319 --> 0:56:34,47
I'm agreeing with you. It is just, you know.
I'm new here and everything is crazy. And


389
0:56:34,47 --> 0:56:42,859
you know, I have to get used to everything.
Get it step by step. You know.


390
0:56:42,859 --> 0:56:55,22
Me too. I've been in Los Angeles for two days,
but we're  i think this is the best.


391
0:56:55,22 --> 0:56:58,96
You came from Paris, I came from Moscow and
we met and it is very cool.


392
0:56:58,96 --> 0:57:5,74
Isn't that strange that we've met after
you know, you came more that 12 hours in the


393
0:57:5,74 --> 0:57:15,9
plane, get here wow! It is something amazing.
It is the best thing, you know.


394
0:57:15,9 --> 0:57:23,539
People are suppose to meet each other. Suppose
to meet people they love. It just happened


395
0:57:23,539 --> 0:57:25,18
to us.
Surprised.


396
0:57:25,18 --> 0:57:32,95
You kind of remind me of my mom. You look
beautiful and you are an awesome person.


397
0:57:32,95 --> 0:57:39,269
I've never met anybody like you, so open.
We've got good time and is awesome. 


398
0:57:39,269 --> 0:57:43,279
This is the most important. 
I think is great. I would like to meet your


399
0:57:43,279 --> 0:57:50,299
family, maybe they will come here. 
Because you know, if we wanna marry. You know.


400
0:57:50,299 --> 0:57:54,91
Then.
I would like to know the members of your family,


401
0:57:54,91 --> 0:58:1,19
most of your family. I think is important.
Yeah, met too. I don't have much family. My


402
0:58:1,19 --> 0:58:3,349
mom died when I was ten and I have...


403
0:58:3,349 --> 0:58:10,94
I have my dad left and he is in Moscow. 
Maybe he will come. I think he will come when


404
0:58:10,94 --> 0:58:19,45
he will find out I'm getting married.
I think he is gonna love you.


405
0:58:19,45 --> 0:58:23,91
He is very busy with his job. I don't approve
what he is doing with his job. I think he


406
0:58:23,91 --> 0:58:26,92
is gonna love you, as a daughter. He always
wanted a girl. I'm the only one son in the


407
0:58:26,92 --> 0:58:34,24
family so to have a daughter. He is gonna
have a daughter. Beautiful.


408
0:58:34,24 --> 0:58:42,45
Thank You. I'm sorry what happened to your
mom. You had to grow up alone with your father.


409
0:58:42,45 --> 0:58:46,96
You don't have your grandma helping you. 
I don't know, is just...


410
0:58:46,96 --> 0:58:51,559
I'm sad when I hear that because, it wasn't
easy for you.


411
0:58:51,559 --> 0:58:58,74
Yeah, you are right it wasn't easy. Maybe
this is why I've made this move so fast just


412
0:58:58,74 --> 0:59:8,92
to get married because, I missed us for the
last 11 years. I'm 21 and you are 20 and we


413
0:59:8,92 --> 0:59:15,279
are happy. So is really cool. I just have
basically, like I've got my mom back.


414
0:59:15,279 --> 0:59:21,46
I've got with the person that I'll spend my
life with. That is more than mom.


415
0:59:21,46 --> 0:59:27,15
I'e got the person that I will spend my life
with it.


416
0:59:27,15 --> 0:59:31,999
Well, we are both young and hopefully we will
get along together well, because we need more


417
0:59:31,999 --> 0:59:38,89
experience. But I'm so happy to be here, I
have only you here. It is amazing. 


418
0:59:38,89 --> 0:59:46,79
You are amazing. That's what happened to me.
I'm gonna pray to God that our marriage is


419
0:59:46,79 --> 0:59:50,759
gonna last forever and we are going to spend
to death and die in the same day.


420
0:59:50,759 --> 1:0:3,799
Wow! I hope so too, in the dame day!
 
1:00:00.799,1:00:03.069
You are going to have a good time.


421
1:0:3,799 --> 1:0:33,69
I promise you. I'll treat you like a queen.


422
1:0:33,69 --> 1:0:36,69
Uncle!


423
1:0:36,69 --> 1:0:44,13
Ivan, are you alright? Your father asked me
if you are OK.


424
1:0:44,13 --> 1:0:55,99
I'm OK, I'm gonna just use the restroom.
I'll ask Jacob's mom to make us some tea.


425
1:0:55,99 --> 1:1:13,69
I don't think she is in any condition to fix
us tea.


426
1:1:13,69 --> 1:2:9,539
Ivan what are you doing? Come back! I just
want to talk with you.


427
1:2:9,539 --> 1:2:15,539
Celine!


428
1:2:15,539 --> 1:2:20,499
Hey baby. I had a nightmare. 


429
1:2:20,499 --> 1:2:24,23
I'm sorry.
I dreamed that my uncle came from Moscow 


430
1:2:24,23 --> 1:2:29,359
and killed all my friends and killed you and we've
got married and...


431
1:2:29,359 --> 1:2:35,96
So what's wrong that we've got married?
It is not that is just all my friends died,


432
1:2:35,96 --> 1:2:43,13
and you...
Don't worry, I'm here.


433
1:2:43,13 --> 1:2:53,809
I've got a call.
That's from Moscow. 


434
1:2:53,809 --> 1:3:1,329
Take it.
Hello. What?


435
1:3:1,329 --> 1:3:7,63
What happened?
Somebody called me from Moscow. One of my


436
1:3:7,63 --> 1:3:14,29
uncles said that my dad got shot two days
ago


437
1:3:14,29 --> 1:3:25,19
What! I'm so sorry. Oh, poor you.


438
1:3:25,19 --> 1:4:46,89
When I've got the news that my father died
is like my dream became alive.


439
1:4:46,89 --> 1:4:56,13
Where is Tony? Who's Tony?
The guy from the airport.


440
1:4:56,13 --> 1:5:3,46
That guy.


441
1:5:3,46 --> 1:5:6,46
He took the Escalade to the shop. 
Had to get fixed.


442
1:5:6,46 --> 1:5:8,769
Can he handle that?


443
1:5:8,769 --> 1:5:18,64
I don't know. He's gonna probably crush the
damn thing.


444
1:5:18,64 --> 1:5:23,499
I'm out. Demitry, 
What did you got?


445
1:5:23,499 --> 1:5:34,359
Full house. Nobody is that lucky.
OK boys, that's enough. 


446
1:5:34,359 --> 1:5:35,829
Don't we have anything else to do?
 


447
1:5:35,829 --> 1:5:40,23
Demitry, a little bit more poker 
won't kill you. A little bit? 


448
1:5:40,23 --> 1:5:44,97
We're playing for one or two hours! 
What else we're gonna do?


449
1:5:44,97 --> 1:5:55,93
We have people to kill. Let't get to work.
Work? We don't work. We don't have jobs. 


450
1:5:55,93 --> 1:6:1,589
Our only job, is you.
Don't you ever speak to me like that.


451
1:6:1,589 --> 1:6:6,79
Or what? 
You are messing with the wrong person.


452
1:6:6,79 --> 1:6:11,13
If I was you I would watch my back.
You are going to come to our country, my city,


453
1:6:11,13 --> 1:6:22,97
and tell me what to do?
You guy, think I would give you a loaded gun?


454
1:6:22,97 --> 1:6:36,97
Do you believe this guy? Call Tony.


455
1:6:36,97 --> 1:7:23,789
Tony!  Yeah. Come on in. 
We have a mess to clean.


456
1:7:23,789 --> 1:7:26,789
Thank you Jake for not betraying me 
and taking care of Demitry.


457
1:7:26,789 --> 1:7:31,18
Are you kidding? It was fun. 
Demitry thought he can come here


458
1:7:31,18 --> 1:7:36,4
 and tell us what to do? 
But he was wrong.


459
1:7:36,4 --> 1:7:42,119
Now I can see I can trust you Jake. I'm gonna
let you run the area that you wanted so bad.


460
1:7:42,119 --> 1:7:49,21
So you are going to put me in charge of LA?
You deserve it. After Demitry took out Alexander,


461
1:7:49,21 --> 1:7:56,21
we became independent. 
Now nobody can tell us what to do.


462
1:7:56,21 --> 1:8:21,569
Except for me.


463
1:8:21,569 --> 1:8:24,569
Are you having a good time?


464
1:8:24,569 --> 1:8:30,21
Yes, I am Jacob.


465
1:8:30,21 --> 1:8:34,67
Baby, do you know what day is today? 


466
1:8:34,67 --> 1:8:40,12
It is our anniversary! 
I can't believe I forgot about it.


467
1:8:40,12 --> 1:8:48,53
I've got you something.
Oh, That is so sweet.


468
1:8:48,53 --> 1:9:6,53
I love you baby.


469
1:9:6,53 --> 1:18:9,11
Thank You for Watching
