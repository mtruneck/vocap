###0 Hey, I'm Ryan Duffy, and welcome to VICE Today.
###2 
###7 On today's episode our resident office nerd, Thomas
###10 Morton, is going to run you through his favorite YouTube
###12 videos of all time.
###14 Then Shan's going to take to the streets to talk to people
###16 about their plans for summer love.
###18 But first up, Hanson O'Haver, a weird little house plant who
###22 sits in the corner of our office, is going to talk to
###24 you about his favorite rapper of all time.
###26 
###30 HANSON O'HAVER: Hey.
###30 I'm Hanson O'Haver.
###31 Welcome to This Week in Drake, VICE's look at what Drake's
###34 been up to lately.
###35 So there were really two big pieces of
###37 Drake news this week.
###38 The first is that he announced a tour that's sort of like a
###41 monsters of blog rap tour.
###43 It's with 2 Chainz, formerly Tity Boi, J Cole, Waka Flocka
###49 and the geographically confoundingly
###52 named French Montana.
###55 Personally, I'm not really a big fan of concerts because I
###58 think all the best Drake songs are kind of sad and about
###61 being lonely.
###62 I think it's sort of weird to be 2,000 people in the room
###66 feeling alienated.
###68 The other piece of news.
###69 He was in Miami alongside Birdman, Lil' Wayne and DJ
###74 Khaled filming a video for "HYFR." Personally, I think
###78 that "HYFR" is probably one of the worst songs on Take Care
###82 just because the chorus of "hell yeah, fucking right" is
###84 really dumb to just repeat that over and over.
###87 Doesn't really do much for me.
###89 And also because in the song, Drake and Lil' Wayne talk
###92 about fucking the same girls, and it's kind of weird.
###97 I just think Lil' Wayne's sort of gross.
###99 But to be fair to Wayne, I knew this girl in high school
###102 that moved to LA, and I heard that she sucked his dick, and
###106 nothing bad happened to her.
###108 She's fine and everything.
###109 So if Drake's cool with that, more power to Drake.
###114 But anyways, the video's supposed to
###115 be bar mitzvah themed.
###117 I never got a chance to go to a bar mitzvah, so I hope that
###120 the video will kind of show me what that's all about.
###123 Take care.
###124 
###128 RYAN DUFFY: So just to recap, Hanson is legitimately
###130 concerned, like really honest to God worried, about Lil'
###133 Wayne's STDs.
###134 But he's also excited to learn about a Jewish rite of passage
###137 via a Drake music video.
###139 So up next we've got What You're
###140 Watching with Thomas Morton.
###142 I was actually a little worried about this show
###144 because I feel like Thomas, as much as I love him, is a bit
###148 of a weirdo, and not many people understand
###151 his sense of humor.
###152 As it turns out, Thomas is a complete savant when it comes
###155 to hilarious videos on YouTube.
###156 
###160 THOMAS MORTON: Hi.
###160 Welcome to the VICE offices.
###162 As you can see, everybody here is doing a very good job
###164 looking busy.
###165 They're all at computers though, which means what
###167 they're actually doing is basically what you're doing.
###169 Screwing around on the internet.
###171 I work on a computer too.
###173 I'm no stranger to YouTube links.
###176 And so I decided to put together a few of my favorites
###178 from this week.
###180 Come enjoy the cream of the crap.
###182 
###187 Since it's our first week together, a way of forging a
###190 little bond of intimacy with us, I figured instead of doing
###193 the week's round up, I would kind of dig back into the
###195 personal archives and share with you five of my, maybe not
###199 all-time favorites, but I think significant YouTube
###202 clips from my own life.
###206 The first one is completely self-contained and
###209 self-explanatory.
###210 It's an Asian reporter going down a slide.
###214 REPORTER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###216 
###222 [SHOUTING]
###225 THOMAS MORTON: Look, I'm not going to try to--
###229 kind of want to make that my ring tone, to be frank.
###231 The next video is what qualifies as a griefing video.
###234 It's labeled an epic troll, which is kind of
###238 like slander and libel.
###239 They're both more or less the same term.
###241 The audio is piped in, which makes it even funnier.
###244 And then to emphasize that and make sure you understand
###247 exactly what swears they're sputtering,
###250 they've added text.
###253 MALE SPEAKER 1: [BRITISH ACCENT]
###253 Fucking, cock-sucking prick, yeah.
###256 Fucking play the game properly, you little shit.
###259 THOMAS MORTON: As a veteran of many busted NES controllers
###264 and harsh words to my mom in other rooms, I think it's not
###269 only par for the course, but it's kind of
###271 like grunting in tennis.
###273 It gives you--
###274 it helps you play better.
###275 MALE SPEAKER 1: [BRITISH ACCENT]
###275 You stupid prick.
###277 MALE SPEAKER 2: You fuckin' gay bitch.
###281 THOMAS MORTON: So the deal with this kid is--
###283 I think it's like a 10-year-old who has a camera
###286 but probably also autism.
###288 So this is just one video from this kid who has a whole page
###291 that you should subscribe to immediately.
###294 Because all his videos are of--
###296 not of him but of what he sees through the camera, and then
###300 him talking about the camera and kind of getting angry
###304 about the camera's occasional non-functionality.
###307 
###311 MALE SPEAKER 3: Dang it.
###312 Can't zoom up on this camera.
###313 
###316 Wonder if all these people have ever heard of
###318 the camera I have.
###319 
###322 THOMAS MORTON: This is a little more cerebral fare.
###325 It's a robotic birth simulator as being demonstrated by a guy
###332 who has clearly been inside a countless number of vaginas.
###339 He makes Wilt Chamberlain look like Tiny Tim, basically.
###343 MALE SPEAKER 4: Often junior doctors can place the first
###346 blade but have a lot of difficulties to place the
###349 second blade.
###350 THOMAS MORTON: I cannot believe this hasn't been taken
###352 down and moved to Redtube yet.
###355 MALE SPEAKER 4: And the junior doctor has to go through the
###356 spheres in order to place the forceps.
###359 
###362 THOMAS MORTON: This last clip was a favorite of our British
###365 office for a while.
###367 I think because all British people are racist against
###370 every other country in Europe.
###372 It's a pool girl at--
###374 as evidenced by the bathing suits-- a Eastern European
###378 party of some sort in the mother of all K-holes.
###382 [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]

###415 RYAN DUFFY: Last up, we sent the nicest person we have ever
###418 met in our lives, Shan Shan, out to the streets of New York
###421 to talk about summer love.
###425 Hi, I'm [? Shan ?]
###425 Huang.
###426 I'm with VICE.com.
###427 Today we're here to find out people's
###428 plans for summer loving.
###430 I'm wondering what's your plan as far as summer loving goes.
###434 MALE SPEAKER 5: As far as what?
###435 MALE SPEAKER 6: Summer living?
###436 SHAN HUANG: Summer loving.
###438 MALE SPEAKER 6: Somewhere loving?
###439 SHAN HUANG: Summer.
###440 Summer.
###440 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Summer is the worst period
###442 to find a good guy.
###444 MALE SPEAKER 7: Girls in NYC are a little bit more guarded.
###447 You walk down the street, you try to talk to one, they think
###450 you're a psycho or something.
###452 MALE SPEAKER 8: In general, I live and love.
###453 So I love all humans.
###454 So I get to be in love all the time.
###456 SHAN HUANG: Where do you think is the sexiest place in Paris?
###460 MALE SPEAKER 9: My home.
###461 
###463 SHAN HUANG: Do you mind to tell us your location?
###466 MALE SPEAKER 9: No.
###466 SHAN HUANG: Men who wear shorts.
###468 Do you think they're sexy?
###471 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: No.
###471 SHAN HUANG: What about flip-flops?
###473 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Flip-flops?
###473 SHAN HUANG: Do you think French people
###474 are into Asian girls?
###476 MALE SPEAKER 9: No.
###477 MALE SPEAKER 8: I definitely like certain things.
###478 I like light skin.
###479 I like half black half white.
###481 I like Latin girls.
###482 But then again, Scarlett Johannson is awesome.
###486 When I get some more external power, I'm totally going to
###489 take you on a date.
###490 SHAN HUANG: Do you think you'll bring God to the
###491 bedroom with you?
###493 MALE SPEAKER 8: I don't leave God anywhere.
###496 I make love.
###497 I don't fuck anymore.
###499 SHAN HUANG: If you can take a girl that you love on a date
###502 in the summer, where would you like to bring her to?
###505 MALE SPEAKER 6: In the summer, somewhere nice.
###507 First I'd like to know her first.
###509 Because you can't just take any girl anywhere.
###511 Right?
###512 MALE SPEAKER 7: The woods.
###513 Lot more fun.
###514 Tie each other to trees.
###516 It's all fun and games.
###517 Just don't do it during hunting season.
###519 SHAN HUANG: Are you afraid that while that's happening,
###522 you hear people shooting guns?
###524 MALE SPEAKER 7: The gunshots don't bother me.
###526 I'm a gun owner.
###526 SHAN HUANG: How can a girl catches your eye?
###529 MALE SPEAKER 6: Catch my eye?
###531 One girl?
###532 Be alone.
