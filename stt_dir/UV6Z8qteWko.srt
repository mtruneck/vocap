0:0:3,7 --> 0:0:8,86
Hello FoodTubers, it's me Jemma and I'm here
at Crumbs and Doilies HQ to show you how to


2
0:0:8,86 --> 0:0:12,23
make sunshine out of cake.
We're gonna make a Lemon Meringue cake which


3
0:0:12,23 --> 0:0:19,579
is a lot like lemon meringue pie but way better!
Pie's so last everything.


4
0:0:19,579 --> 0:0:23,689
We're gonna make that with lots of lovely
lemons and sponge and we're gonna cover it


5
0:0:23,689 --> 0:0:27,98
in marshmallowy meringue icing and blowtorch
it, so there's some danger involved.


6
0:0:27,98 --> 0:0:34,56
Right, so I've got 375g of caster sugar and
I'm just gonna pop that in my mixer and add


7
0:0:34,56 --> 0:0:42,23
375g of butter. Which is really super soft.
I'm gonna start that on a low speed then speed


8
0:0:42,23 --> 0:0:47,27
it up to a medium-high speed until it's really
super white and fluffy. It's gonna take maybe


9
0:0:47,27 --> 0:0:53,0
like five minutes or so.


10
0:0:53,0 --> 0:0:57,21
It's gone really super pale and really super fluffy


11
0:0:57,21 --> 0:1:1,16
and I could just eat that right now
to be honest because that's delish!


12
0:1:1,16 --> 0:1:6,69
You're gonna need 6 eggs. I'm using large,
free range, organic eggs. With the mixer on


13
0:1:6,69 --> 0:1:11,68
a low speed, one at a time crack them into
your mixer and give them a little mix before


14
0:1:11,68 --> 0:1:19,9
you add the next one.


15
0:1:19,9 --> 0:1:20,92
I'm just gonna stop it and give it a quick


16
0:1:20,92 --> 0:1:24,12
scrape just to make sure I've got all the
bits and bobs out of the bottom.


17
0:1:24,12 --> 0:1:30,229
So give it one last whiz up.
Whiz, whiz, whiz, whiz, whiz.


18
0:1:30,229 --> 0:1:34,0
Alright, I'm gonna put the lemon zest in now.
Pop that out.


19
0:1:34,0 --> 0:1:39,2
And I've given these a wash. I used unwaxed
lemons. The zest of the lemon sort of gives


20
0:1:39,2 --> 0:1:43,2
it a tang without the pang.


21
0:1:43,2 --> 0:1:46,0
I think I've got all my zest of my lemons


22
0:1:46,0 --> 0:1:51,4
now so I'm gonna whack my paddle back in.


23
0:1:51,4 --> 0:1:54,43
I've got 375g of self raising flour, which


24
0:1:54,43 --> 0:2:0,1
I've sifted and on a really low speed mix
it just really gently.


25
0:2:0,1 --> 0:2:5,439
Here we go.
Give its bum a little pat so that all the


26
0:2:5,439 --> 0:2:10,519
flours off the sides.
I've got two tablespoons of milk and two and


27
0:2:10,519 --> 0:2:17,409
a half tablespoons of lemon juice. On a really
low speed, pour it in at the same time.


28
0:2:17,409 --> 0:2:22,349
Get in there with your spatula and just make
sure you scrape down the sides and all down


29
0:2:22,349 --> 0:2:28,99
the bottom so that any nuggets get mixed in
as well.


30
0:2:28,99 --> 0:2:34,68
And I think we're ready to go.
I've got three 8 inch sandwich tins which


31
0:2:34,68 --> 0:2:39,849
I've greased with butter and then dusted with
flour. And then as evenly as possible, dish


32
0:2:39,849 --> 0:2:47,29
this lovely batter out into them.
I'm just gonna use a palette knife just to


33
0:2:47,29 --> 0:2:51,719
smooth that all out so that you bake a nice,
even cake.


34
0:2:51,719 --> 0:2:55,669
Right, so we've got the three layers for our
cake ready to go in the oven and I've preheated


35
0:2:55,669 --> 0:3:1,1
my oven to 170Â°C and I'm gonna pop them in
there for 25-30 minutes then we'll just check


36
0:3:1,1 --> 0:3:9,0
them after 25.


37
0:3:9,0 --> 0:3:12,189
While that's cooking I'm gonna make some Marshmallowy


38
0:3:12,189 --> 0:3:19,4
Meringue Icing. I've got a Bain-marie, which
is a saucepan with a bowl over the top. The


39
0:3:19,4 --> 0:3:22,409
saucepan has about an inch of water in. You
don't want to have too much because you don't


40
0:3:22,409 --> 0:3:25,699
want it to hit the bottom of the bowl when
you put it on.


41
0:3:25,699 --> 0:3:33,1
So in my bowl I have a 175g of caster sugar
and then I'm gonna add a 1/4 tsp of Cream


42
0:3:33,1 --> 0:3:39,489
of Tartar and a 1/4 tsp of salt. We've got
5 tbsp of Golden Syrup or if you're in the


43
0:3:39,489 --> 0:3:46,489
States you can use Corn Syrup. So that just
goes in there as well. We have a tsp of Vanilla


44
0:3:46,489 --> 0:3:55,109
extract, then 2 tbsp of water. Right, that's
that. And then we need 2 egg whites. So I'm


45
0:3:55,109 --> 0:4:3,319
just gonna separate them into my bowl.
You need to start mixing immediately.


46
0:4:3,319 --> 0:4:10,79
And I'm using an electric whisk because this is
gonna take quite some time. Your heat should


47
0:4:10,79 --> 0:4:20,459
be sort of medium to high and the speed of
the mixer, make it quite fast as well.


48
0:4:20,459 --> 0:4:24,39
And this is gonna be almost white in the end.
You don't wanna watch me doing this for 10


49
0:4:24,39 --> 0:4:28,0
minutes so let's skip ahead.


50
0:4:28,0 --> 0:4:31,9
It's pretty sticky stuff! Mmm it's really


51
0:4:31,9 --> 0:4:38,76
good actually, I'm just gonna.. mmm it is
like a marshmallow, mixed with a meringue.


52
0:4:38,76 --> 0:4:41,85
It's exactly that.
So that's all ready to go. We'll just pop that


53
0:4:41,85 --> 0:4:44,65
to one side until we're ready to use it.
So we've done our topping and now we need


54
0:4:44,65 --> 0:4:48,73
to get our fillings.
I have made a delicious lemon buttercream and it's


55
0:4:48,73 --> 0:4:55,12
exactly the same method as my vanilla buttercream
video recipe. So just replace the milk and


56
0:4:55,12 --> 0:5:3,97
vanilla for lemon juice and if you want to
see that video then click this blob.


57
0:5:3,97 --> 0:5:9,23
The other filling is lemon curd. If you want
to learn how to make that then click this


58
0:5:9,23 --> 0:5:15,76
blob. Now! hahaha.
If you don't have the time or the inclination


59
0:5:15,76 --> 0:5:19,82
to make your own lemon curd then don't despair,
you can get these in most supermarkets. It's


60
0:5:19,82 --> 0:5:23,98
really tangy and lemony. Perfect for all this
sweet stuff we're chucking on the cake.


61
0:5:23,98 --> 0:5:28,9
So, speaking of cake, we've got three layers
out of the oven. They've cooled down.


62
0:5:28,9 --> 0:5:31,72
And you can tell they're ready because they
are just kinda springing back. And I'm gonna


63
0:5:31,72 --> 0:5:38,22
just pop them out of the tins now. And if
you wanna slide a palette knife underneath


64
0:5:38,22 --> 0:5:41,68
them just to loosen them up a bit. I'm putting
them on grease-proof paper just so I can move


65
0:5:41,68 --> 0:5:45,92
them around really easily.
Right, so I'm gonna take the tops off my cake


66
0:5:45,92 --> 0:5:48,74
just to make sure they are really super flat
and all the crispy bits have come off and


67
0:5:48,74 --> 0:5:52,75
I'm using a cake leveller for that. You can
use a serrated knife if you want but this


68
0:5:52,75 --> 0:5:59,7
is a little bit more accurate.


69
0:5:59,7 --> 0:6:1,17
You can eat this in secret or you can just


70
0:6:1,17 --> 0:6:10,68
throw it away. Or you can eat it in secret!
I'm just gonna do that for all of the cakes.


71
0:6:10,68 --> 0:6:14,68
Now we've levelled our cakes off there's one
more thing I'm going to do. Now you don't


72
0:6:14,68 --> 0:6:19,76
have to do this if you don't want to but I'm
not a massive fan of the edge of the cake,


73
0:6:19,76 --> 0:6:25,43
the cake that's been in touch with the tin.
Because it's where the cakes got the hottest


74
0:6:25,43 --> 0:6:28,76
and it's usually the driest part of the cake.
So I like to get rid of that.


75
0:6:28,76 --> 0:6:33,5
I've got a 7 inch cake board and I'm gonna
basically cut around each cake and then you


76
0:6:33,5 --> 0:6:38,84
can just get rid of that or you can sneak
a little bit. Just to make sure it's nice,


77
0:6:38,84 --> 0:6:44,8
and it is nice.


78
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:46,66
Right so our three layers are ready.


79
0:6:46,66 --> 0:6:53,3
I have a turntable. I did for many years decorate
cakes without one so don't be alarmed if you


80
0:6:53,3 --> 0:6:57,42
don't have one. You can do it but it's just
a little bit easier with one. I've also got


81
0:6:57,42 --> 0:7:3,48
an 8 inch board here for my 7 inch cake and
I'm just gonna whack a little bit of buttercream


82
0:7:3,48 --> 0:7:10,11
on the bottom so that my cake sticks to it.
On with our first layer. Just pick it up with


83
0:7:10,11 --> 0:7:15,43
both hands and whack it as in the middle as
you possibly can and just squish it down a


84
0:7:15,43 --> 0:7:22,0
little bit just so it's nice and stuck.
And first of all we're gonna use this lovely,


85
0:7:22,0 --> 0:7:27,18
delicious, creamy, lemon, zingy buttercream.
Make sure it goes all the way to the edges.


86
0:7:27,18 --> 0:7:35,2
As level as possible. Then it's lovely, zingy
lemon curd time. You don't wanna mix it in


87
0:7:35,2 --> 0:7:40,12
with the buttercream. You want it to kind
of maintain the layer. And with this one you don't


88
0:7:40,12 --> 0:7:44,17
wanna go too close to the edge because you
don't want this to be oozing out. Oooh but


89
0:7:44,17 --> 0:7:49,45
that looks nice doesn't it. It's like a giant
fried egg, but much tastier.


90
0:7:49,45 --> 0:7:57,77
Right, so on with the next layer. And then
do the same thing again for this layer.


91
0:7:57,77 --> 0:8:1,9
Ooooh Yeeeeah!


92
0:8:1,9 --> 0:8:5,29
Now it's time for the final layer and because


93
0:8:5,29 --> 0:8:11,27
I want this to be nice and straight I'm gonna
turn this layer upside down because the side


94
0:8:11,27 --> 0:8:17,62
that it's been baked in the tin on is really
straight, as you can see.


95
0:8:17,62 --> 0:8:24,93
Right, give it a little spin, make sure it's
all straight and lovely. Clean it up at the


96
0:8:24,93 --> 0:8:29,96
sides.
Right, so my cakes naked and delicious but


97
0:8:29,96 --> 0:8:34,229
it's gonna be even more delicious in a minute
because we're gonna put the final piÃ¨ce de


98
0:8:34,229 --> 0:8:38,59
rÃ©sistance on top, which is the Marshmallowy
Meringue icing.


99
0:8:38,59 --> 0:8:48,309
Gently, but assertively smooth it on. What
you want is to cover your entire cake.


100
0:8:48,309 --> 0:8:54,259
I'm really slathering it on here which is absolutely
fine because it's delicious.


101
0:8:54,259 --> 0:9:1,259
So, just generous and gentle, but assertive.


102
0:9:1,259 --> 0:9:5,66
Next it's the danger zone. Get yourself a


103
0:9:5,66 --> 0:9:11,569
blow torch and because we're dealing with
fire I'm gonna use a baking tray to pop my


104
0:9:11,569 --> 0:9:15,379
cake on just so I don't melt my turntable.


105
0:9:15,379 --> 0:9:19,3
Ready... woooo.


106
0:9:19,3 --> 0:9:24,3
So what this is going to do is caramelise
the sugar in your frosting so it's gonna get


107
0:9:24,3 --> 0:9:28,509
a really nice caramelly flavour and it's also
gonna make it look really blimming awesome.


108
0:9:28,509 --> 0:9:37,0
So, very gently, from a little bit of a distance,
not pointing the flame at the cameraman,


109
0:9:37,0 --> 0:9:45,0
lick it with the blowtorch.


110
0:9:45,0 --> 0:9:48,759
You can smell the burnt sugar coming off this


111
0:9:48,759 --> 0:9:55,43
cake. It's like caramel, it's so good.
Right, so that's the top. Now we need to do the sides,


112
0:9:55,43 --> 0:9:59,579
so...
This is where having a turntable comes in


113
0:9:59,579 --> 0:10:4,5
really handy.


114
0:10:4,5 --> 0:10:9,869
Alright, i think we're just about done. So,


115
0:10:9,869 --> 0:10:15,339
turn off your blow torch.
We're done with the fire but we are not done


116
0:10:15,339 --> 0:10:20,0
with this cake. We need to eat this cake pronto.
It's so good! Look at that!


117
0:10:20,0 --> 0:10:23,5
Wooooo!
Ooooh caramelly.


118
0:10:23,5 --> 0:10:27,49
So there it is! My super-duper Lemon Meringue
cake with Marshmallowy Meringue icing.


119
0:10:27,49 --> 0:10:30,93
If you like this video and you want to see
more videos by me then don't forget to check


120
0:10:30,93 --> 0:10:35,79
out the Cupcake Jemma channel by clicking
this link where there's loads more videos


121
0:10:35,79 --> 0:10:38,309
to see. And I've really enjoyed making this
for you so I'm probably gonna really enjoy


122
0:10:38,309 --> 0:10:44,0
eating for you on your behalf so...


123
0:10:44,0 --> 0:10:48,6
Look at that!


124
0:10:48,6 --> 0:10:53,699
Oooooooh!
Look at those lovely layers of the buttercream


125
0:10:53,699 --> 0:11:0,6
and lemon curd. I'm so excited about eating
this.


126
0:11:0,6 --> 0:11:7,379
Mmmm tangy and sweet and marshmallowy and
light and delicious. It's like sunshine.


127
0:11:7,379 --> 0:11:16,5
It's a slice of sunshine.
C'mon guys, give us a hand!


128
0:11:16,5 --> 0:13:16,5
Mmmmmm
