###6 Hi.
###7 What's wrong with your neck?
###9 - It's just a little stuff from our workout last night.
###12 - What were you doing? - Incline crunches.
###14 Where were you, anyway?
###15 - On the treadmill, where you left me.
###18 - I didn't leave you.
###19 You say that every time we go to the gym.
###21 - Well, I say that, because whenever we're there,
###24 We're never together.
###25 I used to work out with you.
###27 Now I just work out at the same gym.
###29 - Look, we go together.
###30 We leave together. That's together.
###33 We go to movies. We watch tv.
###34 We surf the web.
###35 Remember that "David goes to the dentist" video?
###38 That was funny.
###40 - Nick, that's not what I mean.
###41 I want to do something together-together,
###43 Meaning if you're not doing a part of it,
###45 And I'm not doing the other part,
###47 It can't be done.
###48 - Well, we can do that upstairs.
###49 - Nick.
###50 - Look, the problem is,
###51 I'm the one always planning stuff for us to do.
###54 - Okay, that is not true.
###58 - Yes, it is, all right?
###61 Look, whenever I ask you what it is you want to do,
###64 You say, "I don't know.
###66 I want to do whatever you want to do."
###67 And then I say, "I want to do something you want to do."
###69 And then you say, "good.
###71 Whatever you decide is what I want to do."
###72 - Well, I do, unless I don't want to do it,
###75 Which I don't know until I do it.
###76 - Fine, I'll tell you what, you want to do something?
###80 You decide what it is, and I'll do it.
###83 - Really? - Really.
###84 And when you come up with something,
###86 Just let me know.
###87 Can I ask you one favor?
###89 - Yes.
###90 - After we do what you want to do together,
###93 Can we do what I want to do together?
###95 - Slow your roll, crook neck.
###97 Let's worry about me first, and then we'll worry about you.
###100 - Mmm-Mmm, yes, indeed.
###104 Ow.

###117 - Hey, good morning. - Good morning.
###119 - I didn't know you were already here.
###121 I've been calling your cell.
###122 - Yeah, I came in early.
###124 I'm trying to find something fun for Nick and I to do together.
###126 - Oh, what you looking at?
###130 - Pottery making?
###131 Seriously?
###133 - Do you have a better idea?
###135 I'm trying not to pick the same old boring stuff.
###138 - Well, if you're looking for the new boring stuff,
###140 You found it.
###141 - Okay, Nick said that he'll do whatever I want him to do.
###144 It's on me.
###145 Oooh, now, this looks fun, and it does not look boring.
###150 - Salsa dancing.
###152 - Yeah, I love salsa.
###154 It's so sexy, the moves, the clothes.
###157 - Yeah, well, have fun with that.
###160 - Okay, what's wrong with salsa dancing?
###162 - Nothing is wrong with it.
###163 I used to love it, until the accident.
###166 - What?
###167 Gigi, you didn't tell me about any accident.
###170 - It happened about three years ago
###172 When I met Jesus.
###174 He would dip me, spin me around,
###177 Flip me over his back.
###179 Oh, it was incredible.
###181 And he was sexy and confident and in control
###185 And just amazing.
###187 And that accent, ooooh.
###192 - Do you need some time alone?
###193 - No. - Okay, so the accident?
###195 - Right, I was hooked. - Mm-Hmm.
###197 - And then I made the fatal mistake
###200 Of moving the relationship out of the studio
###203 And into the street.
###205 You dated him.
###206 - Yes, it was a disaster.
###208 It didn't even last a week.
###209 I mean, in the studio, he was the sexiest man alive,
###212 But on the street, he was broke.
###214 I mean, he lived in a studio apartment,
###216 Wore the same pair of jeans every day,
###217 And when we went out to eat, he wanted me to pay.
###220 And he drove a car.
###221 It was horrible.
###223 I mean, I can't remember the name of it.
###226 It started with a "u."
###227 - A "u"? - Yeah.
###228 - What kind of car starts with a "u"?
###230 - Used. It was used.
###232 - Okay, I love you, but you have to be stopped.
###235 - Well, that will never happen again.
###237 Do they have a word for people
###238 Who are afraid of poor Latin men?
###239 - Yeah, Republicans.
###241 - You know what?
###242 I know one thing.
###244 When I stare into a Latin man's eyes, I'm done.
###248 - Okay, I have an idea. - What?
###251 - You should come with us.
###252 - And why would I do that?
###254 - Because you have a crazy, irrational fear,
###257 And you have to face it.
###258 Now, come here. Come on.
###264 - okay, I'll go.
###268 But when I fall, you better be there to catch me.
###275 - Mom, look at these boots.
###279 - Ohhh, those are so cute.
###283 No.
###284 - What? - No.
###285 - I'll pay you back.
###287 - I'll tell you what,
###288 Save the money you were gonna use to pay me back,
###291 Then buy the boots.
###299 - What do you want?
###300 - Who says I want anything?
###302 I'm here to give you something.
###304 - And what might that be?
###306 - Advice.
###307 Now, listen, I've been watching you,
###309 And I hate to tell you, but you're never gonna get
###311 What you want if you keep asking like that.
###312 - Really, genius?
###314 What would you have done differently?
###315 - Okay, let me put it like this.
###317 The key to getting what you want is making the person believe
###319 It was their idea to give it to you.
###320 I call it the bait and switch.
###323 - What?
###324 - Bait and switch.
###325 It's simple.
###326 Just ask for something The bait.
###328 And en go for something The switch.
###333 Ha, watch and learn.
###338 Hey, dad.
###339 - What up, party people?
###340 - Hey, dad, the mariners are playing this weekend.
###343 - I thought you didn't care about baseball.
###344 - I saw a game on tv, and it turned out to be kind of cool.
###347 You think we can go?
###349 - I'll see what I can do.
###351 - Yes. - All right.
###354 - So what.
###355 You asked for tickets, and you didn't even get them.
###357 - That's not the point.
###358 I didn't want them.
###360 Okay, is there anything else you want besides those boots?
###362 - Well, there is this watch I really like.
###365 - Okay, so here's the deal.
###366 The next time dad asks you to be somewhere, you be late.
###369 - What? That doesn't even make any sense.
###371 - Shh.
###373 You'll find out soon enough.
###374 - Get your finger off my face.
###379 - Nick, baby, I found something for us to do together.
###384 - What is it?
###386 - Salsa.
###388 - Ooh, that is nice.
###391 - So what do you think?
###392 - About what?
###393 - Salsa.
###396 - The dance or the sauce?
###398 - The dance.
###399 Nick, I want to take salsa lessons together.
###402 - Dance class?
###403 - You said you were down for whatever.
###406 You don't want to do this?
###407 - No, it's cool.
###409 It's just that I don't need to take dance lessons.
###411 I can dance.
###413 - Baby, although you do the robot
###416 Better than any man or robot that I've ever known,
###420 I don't want to be doing that with you when I'm 50, okay?
###422 Now, salsa, on the other hand, it's classy, it's grown-up,
###426 And I get to look like this when we do it.
###429 - Ohh, okay, okay, we'll go salsa dancing.
###433 But can I ask you a favor?
###435 - Yeah, what?
###436 - When you go in there, please don't do that.
###443 - Mean.
###445 - It looks like you're stomping grapes, babe.
###451 - Why do women love taking classes,
###453 Cooking classes, painting classes,
###456 Exercise classes?
###457 - Look, it's salsa.
###458 It will be fun.
###460 - Look, all I'm saying is, why do I have to take salsa?
###462 I mean, it's not like I'm going to Cuba.
###464 - Duh.
###466 You're not going for the dance.
###467 You're going for the women.
###469 - I'm married.
###470 - Do this, and you will stay married.
###472 In my years of experience,
###474 I have found there is nothing sexier than a Latin woman.
###476 And if you can get your woman to bring out
###478 Her innermost sexy latina, you will be a very happy man,
###482 Exhausted but happy.
###484 - So Latin women are sexy, but they're not the only one.
###488 Look, they may be annoying,
###490 But the Kardashians are sexy...Mostly.
###493 - No, they're Armenian.
###495 Do you know what Armenians are known for?
###497 Excessive body hair.
###498 You know what latinas are known for?
###499 Creative ways of ripping it out.
###501 Trust me, you want to do this.
###503 - You're serious.
###505 - I am.
###506 Can I come?
###507 - I can't believe you just invited yourself
###509 To my salsa class.
###510 - Yeah, it's weird.
###511 It was like I was trying to convince you,
###513 And I ended up somehow convincing myself.
###518 - Lindsey, you are late.
###521 You were supposed to be home early to stay with Kevin.
###523 - Yeah, I know, at 5:15.
###524 - No, it's 6:00.
###526 - Oh, it's my cheap watch.
###528 It goes in and out, so it doesn't keep the time anymore.
###531 It's all raggedy and tired.
###533 - Well, you need to get a new watch.
###534 - You think so?
###535 - Yeah, I think so.
###537 Look, you need to be places on time.
###539 You need a decent watch.
###540 - What about this one?
###542 I mean, I know it's kind of expensive,
###544 But I hear it's really good.
###545 - $300?
###548 What, you need a new watch so you can be on time for your job?
###550 You need to find something cheaper than that.
###553 - What about this one?
###554 It's not as nice, but it's got some extra bands
###556 And some other stuff.
###558 - That's more like it.
###560 I'll see if I can find it.
###561 - Thanks, dad, and sorry about being late.
###567 - Whoo, I am starting to like this salsa.
###572 Well, you think you like it now.
###573 Wait till I know what I'm doing.
###575 Oooh.
###577 - Yeah, you go, girl.
###579 Get your fine self on out of here.
###582 You just go and get yourself going.
###591 - So, honey, it sounds good, right?
###593 And then at the end of the series,
###595 We will get to perform an entire routine.
###598 - Series?
###599 As in more than one?
###601 - Yeah.
###602 Honey, you can't learn to salsa in an hour.
###604 I mean, really, come on.
###605 Oh, I'm so sorry.
###606 - That's okay. Hey.
###607 - Uh... - What?
###608 - Gigi, what are you doing? What happened to you?
###610 You look like an extra from <i>the color purple.</i>
###612 - I'm disguised as a normal person.
###615 - Okay, why?
###617 - Because even if I can't resist a salsa instructor,
###619 Maybe if I'm dressed like this, he can resist me.
###622 Otherwise, I'll be shacked up living off taquitos and beans.
###625 - Okay, taquitos are Mexican.
###627 - Shh, here he is.
###629 - <i>Hola,</i> everyone.
###631 Welcome to salsa 101.
###633 My name is Diego salsa, and this is my assistant, Elena.
###636 - <i>Hola, amigos.</i>
###637 Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything?
###639 huh?
###641 - It's my salsa shirt.
###643 It was given to me by a woman.
###644 She said I was <i>muy caliente.</i>
###646 I'll give you details later.
###648 - Ooh, I like your shirt.
###651 You look like Fernando lamas.
###656 - All right, everyone,
###657 Elena and I have prepared performance for you guys
###659 So you guys could see exactly what you're gonna look like
###661 At the end of the series.
###665 oooh. I like that.
###669 Yeow!
###671 Oooh. Whoa.
###681 - All right, now I'd like you to find your partners.
###683 - See, honey, together.
###686 - I got it. I got it.
###689 - Would you mind dancing with me?
###691 - No, I don't think so.
###692 - Don't be shy.
###694 The class needs to see that even a normal-looking woman
###696 That nobody ever wants to dance with
###698 Can become the woman she wants through salsa.
###700 - Mm. - What's your name?
###703 - Gigi.
###704 - Gigi? - Mm-Hmm.
###706 - That is a beautiful name. - Yep, thank you.
###707 - It's the letter g... - Yep.
###709 - Twice. - Yep.
###713 - Did everyone find their partners?
###716 All right, this is where the man takes the woman's right hand,
###718 Place in his left hand, take the right hand,
###720 Place on her back, and the lady takes the left hand
###723 And puts it on her man's right shoulder.
###725 Then the man and his woman look at each other in their eyes
###730 And begin.
###732 One, two, three.
###738 - Okay, Nick, you're not doing it right.
###740 - No, I'm doing what he told us to do.
###742 - Okay, well, let's just try it again.
###744 - Okay. - All right.
###745 - Here we go, baby. We got it.
###746 - Okay, and one... ow, ow.
###748 Nick, you keep stepping on my feet.
###750 - I'm trying to step on the floor,
###752 But every time I do, your feet get in the way.
###754 - Okay, okay, why don't we have you dancing with Elena,
###757 And why don't we take you and your amazing
###759 Technicolored dance shirt over to beautiful Gigi?
###762 - Ohh.
###768 - Here we go. One, two, three, five, six, seven.
###770 One, two, three, five, six, seven.
###774 - Wow, you're a quick study.
###776 You have great form.
###778 - Oh, you're not half bad yourself.
###781 - Diego, can you show me how to do that?
###784 - I can certainly try. - Okay.
###785 - Here we go.
###787 - Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
###790 - Okay, let's try that again, and...
###791 - Oh. - Are you okay?
###793 - Yeah, no, you know, I'm fine.
###795 My feet hurt, so I'm just gonna sit down for a minute.
###798 Thank you.
###802 - Wow, this is great. Here we go.
###803 - Whoo.
###804 - Now let's try the shake.
###807 - That's it. - There you go.
###809 - I'm so glad my wife took me to this class.
###817 - Good morning.
###818 - Good morning.
###820 - A present for <i>moi?</i>
###823 Did you look in it?
###824 - No. - Oh, my gosh.
###826 It's so pretty.
###827 Let's see.
###830 "you are my flower.
###833 "I cannot wait to see you blossom.
###836 "for my favorite student.
###839 Diego."
###841 Come on. What is this?
###847 Damn.
###849 - A beautiful Latin man sends you a sexy dress
###852 And says he can't wait to see you blossom,
###854 And all you can say is "damn"?
###856 - I mean, who knew he would go all <i>fat Greek wedding</i> on me?
###859 - Gigi.
###861 - What?
###862 - Maybe it's a sign.
###864 Okay, he wants to see you blossom.
###865 Go ahead and blossom.
###867 You can do this.
###870 - Fine, when are you going back?
###872 - Oh, I'm not going back.
###874 - Why?
###875 Nick looked like he was having a good time.
###877 - Yeah, did you notice it wasn't with me?
###878 - No, 'cause I couldn't see much
###880 Behind Martin's technicolored dance shirt.
###882 - I took this class to be with Nick,
###883 Not to watch him be with somebody else,
###885 And then I freaked out on him when I got home.
###887 - Wait, Suzanne.
###889 You've never taken a salsa class before?
###891 - No, I thought I'd learn with him.
###893 - See, that's where you went wrong.
###894 I always do recon before I take a lesson with a man.
###897 I want to know what I'm supposed to know,
###899 Because even if I don't know it, I know one thing.
###900 I'm not gonna be out there looking like I don't know
###902 And not know it.
###905 - Was that advice?
###906 - You better ask somebody.
###908 Did you like it?
###909 - You know it.
###916 Hi.
###918 - <i>Hola.</i> Suzanne, right?
###920 - Mm-Hmm.
###921 - You were here last night.
###922 - Yeah, you danced with my husband, Nick.
###924 - Yes, I remember.
###926 He's a little rough around the edges,
###928 But he's not bad.
###930 If the two of you take a few more classes,
###931 You'll be out on that floor in no time.
###933 - Oh, well, that's actually kind of why I'm here.
###936 I was hoping to get a refund on the remaining classes.
###939 - <i>¿por que?</i>
###940 - What? - Why?
###942 - What why? - The refund.
###944 Oh, oh, okay, yeah, I thought I would enjoy it,
###948 But I didn't, so...
###949 - Suzanne, can I be honest with you?
###952 - <i>Si.</i>
###954 - Diego danced with you, and afterwards,
###956 He told me you could be a decent dancer,
###958 But he said you're a control freak.
###960 - What?
###961 That is so rude.
###963 - In salsa, the man has to lead, and the woman has to follow.
###967 Otherwise, it doesn't work.
###969 - Okay, but I thought I was letting him lead.
###972 - Can I show you something?
###974 - Uh, yeah, sure.
###976 - Great, just relax.
###978 - Okay.
###979 - In salsa, it's all about letting go,
###981 Starting with this foot, back.
###983 Good.
###984 Let the music transfer through your body.
###986 You might want to look up.
###987 - Oh, sorry. - There you go.
###989 - Now we're gonna go to the side.
###990 Good. Now let loose.
###992 - Okay.
###993 - I knew you were gonna be a natural.
###995 And turn, side, ole.
###1000 - Wow.
###1001 Oh, goodness.
###1003 - Please come back to us.
###1004 - Okay, maybe I will.
###1006 - Can you bring your friend, the one with the glasses?
###1010 - Here I am.
###1011 - <i>Mi Amor.</i>
###1012 - Yes, I <i>Amor.</i>
###1016 - Yes.
###1017 Yes, how you have blossomed.
###1019 My gift looks <i>muy caliente.</i>
###1022 - <i>Gracias.</i>
###1023 - I know you are a rare thing, a delicate flower.
###1027 I would love nothing more than to take our dance
###1029 Into the real world.
###1030 Can I please take you out?
###1032 - No, Diego. I cannot go out with you.
###1034 I am just here to face my demons.
###1036 - <i>¿por que?</i> - What?
###1038 - Why? - What why?
###1040 - Demons. - Demons.
###1042 Oh, yes, demons.
###1043 I can't let myself fall for you, so this...
###1047 This will have to be our last dance.
###1052 - Then we have to make it a great one.
###1054 - Mm.
###1056 Ahh.
###1063 - Okay, Elena, he just oozing sensuality.
###1068 How do you handle it?
###1070 - After a while, you get used to it,
###1072 But why wouldn't she want to go out with him?
###1074 He's beautiful, romantic, and he can dance.
###1077 - And he's broke.
###1079 - Diego?
###1081 His last name is salsa.
###1083 His family owns the name salsa.
###1085 He's worth over $500 million.
###1088 - Are you serious?
###1091 - Just kidding. He's broke.
###1094 - Okay, Gigi, stop looking.
###1096 Don't look into the light.
###1097 - What? - Come on. Let's go.
###1098 Bye-bye, Diego.
###1099 Bye-bye. See ya. Thank you so much.
###1101 No, no, no, this way. Let's go.
###1103 - Can't help it.
###1109 - Hey, mommy.
###1110 - Hey, sweetheart.
###1113 - Wow, that's a nice new watch.
###1115 Where'd you get that?
###1117 - Dad bought it for me.
###1118 - Oh, well, what was wrong with your old watch?
###1120 - It wasn't working, so he thought I needed a new one.
###1123 - Oh, okay.
###1130 So, honey.
###1131 - Hey. - Hey.
###1132 I just saw Lindsey's new watch.
###1135 - Yeah, she needed a new one.
###1136 Her old one was making her late.
###1138 - Really? Let me guess.
###1139 So she was late because her old watch wasn't working,
###1144 So she needed a new pink one with rhinestones.
###1146 - Right.
###1148 - Mm-Hmm, Nick, watch this.
###1150 Lindsey.
###1151 - Yeah, mom?
###1152 - What time is it, honey?
###1153 - It's 7:38.
###1156 - Thank you.
###1157 - No problem.
###1159 - You see that?
###1161 She didn't even look at her watch.
###1162 She uses her phone to tell the time.
###1164 - Wow, she's good.
###1166 - She got me.
###1168 - Well, I know now for next time.
###1169 - I hope so.
###1171 - Well, I've got a full day ahead of me tomorrow.
###1173 I'm taking Kevin to the x games.
###1175 - Wow, that's really nice.
###1177 - Yeah, it's the least I can do
###1178 Since I couldn't get him the mariners tickets.
###1180 - Mariners tickets?
###1182 Since when is Kevin into baseball like that?
###1184 - It's a consolation prize.
###1185 I mean, I felt bad, so I got him the x games tickets instead.
###1188 - Nick, hold on a second.
###1191 Kevin.
###1194 - Yeah, mom.
###1197 - So some mariners tickets opened up this weekend,
###1200 So you can go to that instead of the x games.
###1202 - They did? - Mm-Hmm.
###1204 - Oh, well, you know, maybe me and dad
###1206 Should just go to the x games, you know,
###1209 Since dad already bought the tickets and everything.
###1211 And, you know, somebody else can go to the baseball game
###1214 Instead of me and you, you know,
###1216 If they ever find out that they can get tickets.
###1220 - You see that?
###1221 - I haven't seen a tap dance like that
###1223 Since <i>bring in 'da noise,</i> <i>bring in 'da funk.</i>
###1225 - Kevin, go to your room.
###1227 - Yes, ma'am.
###1228 - He was so believable too,
###1230 Like a little will Smith with the ears and everything.
###1233 - Mm-Hmm, it's the old bait and switch.
